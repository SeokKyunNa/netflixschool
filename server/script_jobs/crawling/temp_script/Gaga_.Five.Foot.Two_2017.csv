00:01:29.047,00:01:30.173,Want some chicken?
00:01:30.256,00:01:32.258,Hey! Down.
00:01:33.343,00:01:36.304,Mommy.
00:01:38.139,00:01:39.349,Ronnie.
00:01:40.016,00:01:41.518,"Come here, sweet girl."
00:01:41.601,00:01:42.727,Chicken.
00:01:45.104,00:01:46.356,...walking out the door.
00:01:49.901,00:01:51.361,This is not happening.
00:01:57.534,00:01:58.660,"Okay, is that one cooked?"
00:01:58.743,00:02:01.955,"No, this is not. Definitely I not give it for you."
00:02:04.833,00:02:06.167,They're really good.
00:02:07.460,00:02:08.586,It's so good.
00:02:11.798,00:02:15.135,"Yeah, me and Taylor are fighting, so that sucks."
00:02:21.224,00:02:25.311,And I'm like just in a different time in my life now.
00:02:25.395,00:02:28.189,I just don't like... I just like... I don't know.
00:02:28.273,00:02:34.612,"I just feel like my threshold for, like, bullshit with men is..."
00:02:34.696,00:02:36.906,it's just-- I don't have one anymore.
00:02:37.574,00:02:38.616,I just don't care.
00:02:38.700,00:02:41.244,I don't know if it's because I'm 30 and I'm...
00:02:41.327,00:02:44.539,"I feel better than ever, you know?"
00:02:44.622,00:02:55.008,"All my insecurities are gone, I don't feel insecure about who I am as a woman. I don't-- I'm not... embarrassed or ashamed of what I have."
00:02:55.091,00:02:58.177,"I just feel like a more sexier, sexual..."
00:02:58.261,00:03:03.933,"like all of that shit is better, and so what I think what happens is, is like..."
00:03:05.310,00:03:06.311,I don't know.
00:03:08.313,00:03:10.857,"Well, in relationships, you have to... I don't know."
00:03:10.940,00:03:13.776,"You got to move together, I guess, as much as you can."
00:03:22.076,00:03:26.372,Warner Brothers greenlit a movie...
00:03:27.373,00:03:30.460,that Bradley Cooper's directing.
00:03:30.543,00:03:33.296,And Bradley wanted me to be in it.
00:03:34.088,00:03:35.423,A Star is Born.
00:03:36.216,00:03:37.634,"And, um..."
00:03:39.177,00:03:42.096,"you know, I'm going to star in the movie."
00:03:54.984,00:03:56.069,It's tight.
00:03:57.153,00:03:58.863,It spasms on the right.
00:04:00.448,00:04:04.744,"It's not all the way up my shoulder yet, into my..."
00:04:04.827,00:04:10.083,"I mean, a little bit. It's not that-- It's the QL. Yeah."
00:04:14.879,00:04:21.386,"If I get depressed, my body can spasm, like, into a full body spasm."
00:04:23.346,00:04:30.144,And it all kind of originates from this trauma in my hip from this injury years ago.
00:04:37.652,00:04:39.445,I wrote this new song.
00:04:39.529,00:04:49.622,"I started it yesterday, and sent it to Mark this morning, and he sent me some guitar stuff back already, so when I get there, we'll maybe do that."
00:04:50.498,00:05:05.305,"So many, I think, men in my life, in business and also that I've dated, you know, over the years, I just started to feel like what I was on my own wasn't good enough."
00:05:08.057,00:05:11.811,And I don't feel that way working with Mark.
00:05:13.980,00:05:15.481,"Oh, bigger, better deal."
00:05:16.858,00:05:18.151,"Bigger, better deal!"
00:05:38.755,00:05:40.173,They probably don't know who I am.
00:05:40.256,00:05:43.384,They probably think I'm just some crazy old lady who lives down the street.
00:05:43.468,00:05:45.178,I'm thirty. I'm old to them.
00:05:51.309,00:05:53.853,I think my back probably looks really good.
00:05:54.479,00:05:57.982,Like a Polynesian scarification ritual. Is it?
00:05:58.066,00:05:59.400,-It is. Turn around. -Is it bad?
00:05:59.484,00:06:04.822,An Englishman with cupping is really funny. I don't know why.
00:06:04.906,00:06:07.784,I'm going to look like such a badass on the beach in Mallorca.
00:06:07.867,00:06:10.870,"Like, Don't fuck with that dude. He's into some weird shit."
00:06:10.953,00:06:11.996,-What do you think? -Hi.
00:06:12.080,00:06:13.623,-Hi. -Hey!
00:06:15.416,00:06:17.043,-Hello! -How you doing?
00:06:17.126,00:06:20.296,Thank you for drawing me that weird Xanax monster.
00:06:20.379,00:06:22.256,"Oh, right. I forgot about that."
00:06:22.340,00:06:25.468,The last time I had a camera in front of me was the Born This Way tour.
00:06:27.178,00:06:32.850,"When I, like, broke my hip, it's been like three years since then, but I'm still dealing with it, and I was just like, Whoa."
00:06:32.934,00:06:34.727,Like life is so crazy.
00:06:37.021,00:06:38.022,I think so.
00:07:11.806,00:07:14.767,"What I was thinking, just some straight, maybe acoustic guitar."
00:07:14.851,00:07:15.935,Yeah. Those could be great.
00:07:39.917,00:07:40.960,to write songs.
00:07:41.043,00:07:44.881,"They say sometimes it's like open heart surgery, you know? Making music."
00:07:46.340,00:07:48.217,"Every time, it's invasive."
00:07:59.353,00:08:01.856,You know it sounds good. You know that it feels right.
00:08:03.191,00:08:04.358,"Well, I'm leaving pretty soon."
00:08:04.442,00:08:06.152,We're not going to be here too long either.
00:08:06.235,00:08:08.946,You're in here by yourself anyways. Just don't act like I'm leaving.
00:08:09.447,00:08:10.948,"See, you're such a good friend."
00:08:11.032,00:08:13.117,"Oh, my God, you are so weird."
00:08:22.752,00:08:28.508,it's just like putting something precious and plastic in a suitcase...
00:08:28.591,00:08:30.510,that you are going to take into the future.
00:08:31.052,00:08:36.891,"Because I've experienced that with people feeling like I was taking from them, right?"
00:08:36.974,00:08:42.730,"I have now learned going-- looking back at what they were saying and going, Oh, my God. No."
00:08:42.813,00:08:46.067,"I was totally, like, honoring."
00:08:46.150,00:08:58.037,"And so, the thing with, like, me and Madonna, for example, is that I admired her always, and I still admire her, no matter what she might think of me."
00:08:59.622,00:09:00.915,"-No, I do. -Yeah."
00:09:00.998,00:09:07.171,"The only thing that really bothers me about her is that I'm Italian and from New York, you know?"
00:09:07.255,00:09:10.967,"So, if I got a problem with somebody, I'm gonna fucking tell you to your face."
00:09:11.717,00:09:27.567,"But no matter how much respect I have for her as a performer, I could never wrap my head around the fact that she wouldn't look me in the eye and tell me that I was reductive, or whatever."
00:09:27.650,00:09:30.236,"She's never given you a call and been like, What the fuck you doing?"
00:09:30.319,00:09:31.821,No. I saw it on fucking TV.
00:09:31.904,00:09:36.993,Telling me that you think I'm a piece of shit through the media is like...
00:09:37.660,00:09:41.080,"it's like a guy passing me, like, a note through his friend."
00:09:41.163,00:09:48.879,"My buddy thinks you're hot. Here's his, like-- Fuck you. Like, Where's your buddy fucking throwing me up against the wall and kissing me?"
00:09:48.963,00:09:49.880,Right.
00:09:49.964,00:09:56.721,I just want Madonna to fucking push me up against the wall and kiss me -and tell me I'm a piece of shit. -Yeah.
00:10:36.385,00:10:45.227,"When producers, unlike Mark, start to act like they're the one-- You know, You'd be nothing without me."
00:10:45.728,00:10:47.271,"For women, especially."
00:10:47.355,00:10:49.732,It's those men have so much power...
00:10:50.274,00:10:55.905,that they can have women in a way that no other men can.
00:10:55.988,00:10:56.822,Mm-hmm.
00:10:56.906,00:11:04.872,"Whenever they want, whatever they want, the cocaine, the money, the champagne, the girls, the hottest girls you've ever seen."
00:11:06.165,00:11:09.669,"And then, I walk in the room, and it's like..."
00:11:12.755,00:11:17.510,"eight times out of ten, I'm put in that category."
00:11:19.095,00:11:25.601,"And they expect from me what those girls have to offer, when that's just not at all what I have to offer in any way."
00:11:28.312,00:11:30.940,I'm not a receptacle for your pain.
00:11:31.982,00:11:33.150,You know what I mean?
00:11:34.151,00:11:36.612,I'm not just a place for you to put it.
00:11:36.695,00:11:37.530,Right.
00:11:38.447,00:11:43.077,"And you felt like you've had to do, like, extreme shit to put yourself out of that category?"
00:11:43.160,00:11:44.829,"I mean, like, what's the methodology?"
00:11:44.912,00:11:57.675,"The methodology behind what I've done is that when they wanted me to be sexy or they wanted me to be pop, I always fucking put some absurd spin on it that made me feel like I was still in control."
00:11:57.758,00:11:58.592,Right.
00:11:59.176,00:12:01.470,"-I know. Fuck it. -So, you know what?"
00:12:01.554,00:12:09.895,"If I'm going to be sexy on the VMAs and sing about the paparazzi, I'm going to do it while bleeding to death and reminding you of what fame did to Marilyn Monroe."
00:12:09.979,00:12:10.813,Right.
00:12:12.064,00:12:13.732,The original Norma Jean.
00:12:14.483,00:12:16.735,And what it did to Anna Nicole Smith.
00:12:17.236,00:12:18.487,And what it did to...
00:12:21.740,00:12:22.575,Yeah.
00:12:23.492,00:12:24.785,Do you know who?
00:12:30.040,00:12:32.251,You can use none of that footage.
00:12:40.092,00:12:41.427,at the Democratic National Convention.
00:12:44.305,00:12:45.431,at the Democratic National Convention.
00:12:53.564,00:12:55.399,Last year she sang the National Anthem.
00:12:55.483,00:12:59.403,This year she could actually do the whole show.
00:13:10.998,00:13:14.293,"who tells everybody, You weren't born to fit in."
00:13:14.376,00:13:15.586,Ready?
00:13:15.669,00:13:23.177,"You were born to stand out, to speak up, to act out, and to live life out loud."
00:13:24.178,00:13:30.309,"Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you, Lady Gaga!"
00:14:24.196,00:14:27.157,-That was so much fun! -Fucking insane. You are such an actress.
00:14:27.241,00:14:28.492,Can we do it again?
00:14:28.576,00:14:30.703,My boob fell out. No one told me.
00:14:40.838,00:14:44.300,How was the sentiment among the people that ran the event?
00:14:47.553,00:14:53.559,It was just the first time in a long time I've been able to get up and do that and not like feel my hip or like...
00:14:53.642,00:14:54.727,-Know what I mean? -Yeah.
00:14:54.810,00:14:58.188,"Like, I didn't feel tight, I didn't feel worried, I didn't feel..."
00:14:59.648,00:15:01.483,nervous about like...
00:15:02.359,00:15:04.862,I just... I loved it.
00:15:04.945,00:15:06.405,-It felt good. -I can tell you this.
00:15:06.488,00:15:08.365,The NFL Halftime Show...
00:15:09.575,00:15:10.826,Did they do a vote?
00:15:10.910,00:15:13.746,Yeah. We might hear some news today.
00:15:14.538,00:15:15.414,Yeah.
00:15:16.415,00:15:18.125,I really think that we'll get it.
00:15:42.399,00:15:44.068,hallowed be thy name.
00:15:44.151,00:15:49.490,"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."
00:16:25.859,00:16:27.653,Both your daughters are beautiful girls.
00:16:27.736,00:16:29.363,Thank you very much. They're good people.
00:16:29.446,00:16:31.198,"-I said, She's Italian. -Yeah. Yeah."
00:16:31.281,00:16:37.079,"-I'm proud. -From Venice. My mother's-- -Oh, I love Venice. -Yeah. Me too."
00:16:54.596,00:16:56.557,"All right, cheers to Tommy. Thanks for coming."
00:16:56.640,00:17:00.436,"Angie Pontani, I love you. Thanks for this."
00:17:00.519,00:17:01.854,Best thing I ever did.
00:17:02.646,00:17:03.564,You.
00:18:06.960,00:18:10.255,-Let's just scratch all that. Yeah. -We can put an A-- E Major here.
00:18:49.545,00:18:51.004,You're killing it. Fucking let it ride.
00:19:18.949,00:19:24.246,"because if she was a witch, you know, these were women that were fucking burned."
00:19:24.329,00:19:25.205,Right?
00:19:25.956,00:19:30.252,"So, whenever she becomes more powerful, she has to flee."
00:19:30.335,00:19:34.298,"And I think that this is also, like, something that women have to do."
00:19:34.381,00:19:41.513,"You know, whenever you become powerful in a relationship or in business, there's always opposition."
00:19:42.848,00:19:46.894,"And being a woman was like, you were owned."
00:19:46.977,00:19:50.856,"And women, I think, still are very much owned in a lot of ways."
00:20:18.842,00:20:22.137,The voyage was plagued with misfortune.
00:20:22.679,00:20:24.640,Many men died.
00:20:25.307,00:20:29.895,The soldiers blamed me for their tumultuous journey.
00:20:29.978,00:20:32.231,Journey.
00:20:32.314,00:20:34.733,For their tumultuous journey.
00:20:35.692,00:20:40.822,The soldiers blamed me for their tumultuous journey.
00:20:43.992,00:20:47.120,I was discovered upon landing...
00:20:47.579,00:20:50.540,I was discovered upon landing...
00:21:02.511,00:21:04.805,Do you want to show more reaction?
00:21:09.393,00:21:17.192,"I'm doing my record, I have things to do, I haven't slept, this is not the only job that I'm doing, I'm trying to do a good job."
00:21:17.276,00:21:21.613,When they come and they told me because of the dialect-- -Fucking tell me beforehand. -These two days of crazy shit.
00:21:21.697,00:21:23.407,Don't take it there.
00:21:24.241,00:21:27.035,So the kiss will happen after I go around him.
00:21:27.119,00:21:28.036,Correct.
00:21:28.120,00:21:28.996,Yep.
00:21:32.541,00:21:35.043,Got gum in my dentures.
00:21:40.173,00:21:42.426,I had a little baby meltdown today.
00:21:42.509,00:21:44.636,Small. A little one.
00:21:45.804,00:21:47.222,Huh?
00:21:48.181,00:21:52.602,I just-- I don't-- I like to know what I'm doing.
00:21:53.437,00:21:54.521,-Before. -Yeah.
00:21:54.604,00:21:56.440,I don't mind changing on the fly.
00:21:57.274,00:22:00.527,But with something this complicated when they keep throwing shit at you...
00:22:00.610,00:22:02.195,-Yeah. -That's like...
00:22:02.738,00:22:04.614,I just don't want to sound German.
00:22:06.116,00:22:07.159,You know what I mean?
00:22:24.092,00:22:27.179,It-- I got-- I hit Mark's car.
00:22:31.600,00:22:33.393,I don't even know how I did that.
00:22:34.061,00:22:34.895,Mark?
00:22:38.356,00:22:40.525,I'm so sorry.
00:22:41.109,00:22:45.989,"I wish if you have a problem with me, just tell it to my face, not to my bumper."
00:22:46.073,00:22:47.407,-I'm sorry. -It's all good.
00:22:47.491,00:22:49.034,-Is it bad? -Yeah.
00:22:49.117,00:22:51.119,"-I mean, does it-- -My car is fine."
00:22:54.081,00:22:55.248,It's all right.
00:22:55.332,00:22:57.042,Hi! You look so beautiful.
00:22:57.125,00:23:00.212,-No... -You do. You look so fresh and lovely.
00:23:00.962,00:23:03.757,"It's the last thing I want you worried about, for sure. It's nothing."
00:23:03.840,00:23:05.842,I can't believe-- I've never gotten in an accident.
00:23:05.926,00:23:08.261,-I can't believe I hit your car. -It's okay.
00:23:08.345,00:23:13.016,"That that was the accident. And like, I'm just like so-- I'm just really terribly like..."
00:23:13.100,00:23:15.435,"-Honestly, I'm very tired. -Yeah?"
00:23:16.311,00:23:18.313,I'm going to hold that over you until the album's done.
00:23:18.396,00:23:21.066,"Oh, my God. My brother."
00:23:41.336,00:23:47.592,I never felt comfortable enough to sing and just be this way now.
00:23:47.676,00:23:49.594,To just sing or wear my hair back.
00:23:49.678,00:23:56.434,"I never felt pretty enough, or smart enough, or a good enough musician."
00:23:58.103,00:23:59.146,That's the good part.
00:23:59.229,00:24:01.857,The good part is that I just didn't feel good enough.
00:24:01.940,00:24:03.233,And I do now.
00:24:03.316,00:24:10.448,"I know I deserve-- that I-- Of all the things I deserve, that is where I know I'm worth something."
00:24:11.283,00:24:13.535,So I have to stay there. You know?
00:24:23.879,00:24:27.716,"I mean, you become famous at 21 or 22, it's like you stop growing up."
00:24:28.466,00:24:30.677,I want to become a woman.
00:24:31.887,00:24:38.226,"Because the truth is that I can always bring my past with me, but I can never go back."
00:24:39.936,00:24:42.022,You got to leave yourself behind.
00:24:49.404,00:25:02.626,"And I've just been so lonely, and I was on the phone with my mom and my dad, and-- Yeah, I was like-- I just told them I was-- They were like, What's wrong? And I was like, I'm fine."
00:25:02.709,00:25:05.420,"And my mom just said, You don't sound okay."
00:25:05.503,00:25:07.464,"And I said, I'm lonely."
00:25:07.547,00:25:14.596,"And I didn't know that my dad was sitting right next to her because they-- she was at the manicure place, but my father goes to get manicures sometimes."
00:25:14.679,00:25:20.143,It's just hysterical. It's like all women and my dad just sitting there like...
00:25:24.356,00:25:28.068,"He knows that I could go home every day, and it's..."
00:25:28.944,00:25:30.320,It's a really big house.
00:25:30.403,00:25:32.489,It's pretty fucking awesome.
00:25:32.572,00:25:35.784,"Yeah, but what guy is going to be like, Oh, sweet pad!"
00:25:35.867,00:25:42.540,"And that I'm going to be into, like-- And just like throw their shoes off, and like-- I'm going to be like-- like what guy is going to do that?"
00:25:42.624,00:25:45.210,Anyone. I don't know.
00:25:46.086,00:25:49.089,You could still be a kind of secure guy and live in that place.
00:25:49.172,00:25:51.841,You can go scouting for me while you're DJing.
00:25:51.925,00:25:53.843,Let me know if you see anyone.
00:25:54.594,00:25:59.724,I just met this dude in Ibiza who loves horses.
00:26:00.308,00:26:02.560,Talk to him on the phone. I'm putting him on.
00:26:02.644,00:26:05.647,-I'm putting him on right now. -That's so jackass.
00:26:06.690,00:26:13.196,HEY GIRL So you want me to post these on your Instagram?
00:26:14.281,00:26:16.616,The same way we did? I'll show you how to do it.
00:26:16.700,00:26:17.701,"Yeah, for sure."
00:26:17.784,00:26:19.577,"-Okay, ready? -Yeah."
00:26:19.953,00:26:20.996,So...
00:26:23.707,00:26:25.083,Post one...
00:26:26.209,00:26:27.294,Post...
00:26:30.422,00:26:33.842,"when you have, like, 18 million people who are going to look at it."
00:26:33.925,00:26:37.220,I'd be so-- I wouldn't be able to post anything ever.
00:26:37.304,00:26:39.931,"-Whoa, 18 million people. -I know. Stop reminding me."
00:26:40.015,00:26:41.725,I'm sorry!
00:26:45.770,00:26:47.397,"Oh, my God!"
00:27:30.315,00:27:33.234,-Did you like even look at the car? -Not yet.
00:27:35.320,00:27:39.824,"I mean, at least you kind of dented it with style. There's a slight symmetry."
00:27:41.451,00:27:45.372,It's going to be so cool. It was worth it. That new melody is...
00:27:45.997,00:27:47.832,It sounds fantastic.
00:27:48.416,00:27:49.918,You're my favorite.
00:28:27.038,00:28:29.666,"Oh, you guys are just making my day talking about this. I could cry."
00:28:29.749,00:28:33.753,"Thank you for-- Thank you-- just before we even, like, keep going-- for this opportunity."
00:28:33.837,00:28:35.171,"Like, I..."
00:28:35.839,00:28:39.968,"Hamish, you know. This is just a dream come true."
00:28:40.051,00:28:41.094,I...
00:28:42.011,00:28:45.557,want to do the opposite of what everyone thinks that I'm going to do.
00:28:45.640,00:28:49.060,Everybody thinks that I'm going to come out there on a fucking throne...
00:28:49.144,00:28:51.813,-In a meat dress. -In a meat dress...
00:28:51.896,00:28:59.028,"with 90 shirtless men, and unicorns, Right? Am I right?"
00:28:59.112,00:29:00.071,-Yeah. -Okay.
00:29:00.864,00:29:03.616,"And then, at the end, I'm going to do something shocking, right?"
00:29:03.700,00:29:05.410,That's going to freak everybody out.
00:29:06.494,00:29:09.205,It's not even in the neighborhood of what we're going to do.
00:29:13.168,00:29:18.840,I'd love to know how you feel about fashion and what it means to you.
00:29:18.923,00:29:24.429,"Well, this album in particular, I want everything to come out of that studio."
00:29:24.512,00:29:28.433,"And that girl. Because when we stay with her, she's the gold."
00:29:28.516,00:29:33.313,"Yeah, well, that's-- And I think that's the-- That's what people will trust as well."
00:29:33.396,00:29:36.649,"Honestly, we've just seen me fucking glamorous for almost ten years."
00:29:36.733,00:29:38.276,"-Yeah. -It's like, it's boring."
00:29:38.943,00:29:40.069,It really is boring.
00:29:40.153,00:29:54.125,"We understand you. Without-- And it's difficult if we haven't actually had those conversations with you, like 'cause we're double guessing everything. But I think that-- Like really, it was such a good-- Sorry. I just-- It feels better."
00:29:56.920,00:29:58.505,I don't want you to feel bad about it.
00:29:58.588,00:30:02.217,"Really, the truth of the matter is, I just want to have a uniform."
00:30:02.300,00:30:12.477,"And I think my uniform should be a black t-shirt, and black jeans, and black boots, and I just wear that a lot, and we get versions of that made."
00:30:12.560,00:30:13.561,You know what I mean?
00:30:13.645,00:30:16.689,You've gone from the meat dress and you've turned it up even more.
00:30:16.773,00:30:19.984,"You know, you've gone-- That next album was even turned up even more."
00:30:20.068,00:30:26.658,And I think to strip back to black is just a go with exactly what you just said.
00:30:26.741,00:30:29.118,"Like that uniform, I just think is gold."
00:30:48.555,00:30:50.640,T magazine to go with the Collier photos.
00:30:50.723,00:30:53.768,It comes out two days after the album in the Times.
00:30:55.061,00:30:55.895,All right.
00:30:55.979,00:31:01.317,"The vibe of this, just the mindset going in, I know this going to be you having to go to another place."
00:31:01.401,00:31:08.741,"It's not necessarily where we are with it. This is fun, confident, you know, how much you love music, how hard you work."
00:31:08.825,00:31:13.788,"This guy, like, is a super high-intellect, but also loves, like, As the World Turns, so it's like super high-low."
00:31:13.872,00:31:15.748,So when do I play the song?
00:31:15.832,00:31:17.584,-In the beginning? -Yeah. Yeah.
00:31:17.667,00:31:20.503,"-Can I play another song, too, for him? -Yeah, play three songs."
00:31:20.587,00:31:26.259,"Okay. That will help me get in a-- Hey, Son."
00:31:29.846,00:31:31.055,Are you okay?
00:31:35.268,00:31:38.104,Okay. Are you at the hospital?
00:31:39.898,00:31:40.899,Okay.
00:31:40.982,00:31:47.280,"Um, I don't know what time we land, but I'm going to look at it and try to come straight to you."
00:31:51.868,00:31:53.119,Okay.
00:31:53.953,00:31:55.914,Um... And...
00:31:57.290,00:32:02.837,"And they-- Your brain scan came back that the cancer is not-- didn't grow in your brain, right?"
00:32:04.005,00:32:04.923,That's good.
00:32:05.632,00:32:07.842,But it's not smaller?
00:32:11.512,00:32:13.598,"Okay, go rest."
00:32:15.308,00:32:17.810,"We'll be there soon, okay? I love you. I'm sorry."
00:32:17.894,00:32:20.313,"-Okay. I love you, too. -Okay."
00:32:20.813,00:32:22.482,"All right. Okay, bye."
00:32:24.776,00:32:29.155,It's just... I just... I just feel like I'm losing everybody.
00:32:33.868,00:32:35.078,Okay.
00:32:38.289,00:32:39.290,-Darryl? -Yes.
00:32:39.374,00:32:40.458,Hi!
00:33:01.062,00:33:02.563,-Do you mind starting with-- -Sure.
00:33:02.647,00:33:07.777,"It was my father's sister, and she died when she was 19."
00:33:07.860,00:33:10.363,She went to the hospital with my grandmother.
00:33:10.446,00:33:17.453,"She was in there, and there was something growing-- There was-- She had lesions, or something was growing on her hands."
00:33:17.537,00:33:20.039,"And the doctors in the '70s, they didn't know what lupus was."
00:33:20.123,00:33:23.668,"They didn't know how to treat it. It's not curable, anyway. Even now."
00:33:24.794,00:33:32.010,So they suggested that they immediately amputate her hands.
00:33:33.219,00:33:37.473,And seeing what that did to him and to my family...
00:33:38.182,00:33:41.102,was the most powerful thing I experienced growing up.
00:33:42.186,00:33:45.064,My family is the most important thing in my life.
00:33:45.148,00:33:45.982,Yeah.
00:33:46.566,00:33:48.526,Joanne was an artist.
00:33:49.068,00:33:51.154,But what happened was that she...
00:33:51.237,00:33:54.449,My grandmother couldn't take her hands from her.
00:33:54.532,00:33:57.952,"So she just said, Just please let my daughter-- just let her go."
00:33:58.036,00:34:04.917,And she told me she went into the waiting room and she prayed to God that he take her.
00:34:05.918,00:34:11.174,"Because she said, I don't want my daughter to remember her last moments in life without her hands."
00:34:13.843,00:34:17.263,"So, you know, I am Joanne."
00:34:18.639,00:34:20.558,I am my father's daughter.
00:34:20.641,00:34:23.019,"And so, that's what this record is about."
00:34:25.271,00:34:27.482,-That's very beautiful. -Thank you. Thanks for listening.
00:34:27.565,00:34:29.150,"-No, thank you for playing it. -Thank you."
00:34:29.233,00:34:30.651,It's a gift to your father.
00:34:30.735,00:34:31.611,Yeah.
00:34:32.070,00:34:32.987,Yeah.
00:34:35.990,00:34:38.701,"Yeah, this is it. She's got this thing on her door."
00:34:43.956,00:34:46.084,"Hi, Grandma!"
00:34:46.167,00:34:47.418,Hello there.
00:34:47.502,00:34:48.586,Hi.
00:34:49.712,00:34:50.838,"Oh, doll."
00:34:51.339,00:34:53.382,-I missed you. -You are such a precious angel.
00:34:53.466,00:34:54.509,You are.
00:34:55.468,00:34:57.136,-So? -I missed you.
00:34:57.637,00:35:00.264,-What a comfy place. Joe is right there. -You like it?
00:35:02.016,00:35:03.810,That's the same photo that's in the restaurant.
00:35:03.893,00:35:06.521,My father. That's Joanne.
00:35:18.866,00:35:20.243,"-Can I have a peach, Grandma? -Of course."
00:35:20.326,00:35:23.454,You can have anything that you find there.
00:35:23.538,00:35:24.956,It's like a vacuum.
00:35:27.083,00:35:30.044,Why you got this sexy picture of me over here?
00:35:31.295,00:35:32.463,Stefani.
00:35:33.840,00:35:35.341,It's my headshots when I was...
00:35:36.676,00:35:38.511,I think I was 15.
00:35:38.594,00:35:40.471,I was a serious actress.
00:35:41.013,00:35:42.640,Here. This proves that she had braces.
00:35:42.723,00:35:46.644,"Hey, if I had kept that gap, then I would have even more problems with Madonna."
00:35:48.563,00:35:50.398,"Oh, these are beautiful."
00:35:50.481,00:35:53.776,There is an album here with something that she wrote.
00:35:53.860,00:35:55.069,That's one of her...
00:35:56.320,00:35:58.823,"This is Joanne's handwriting, right?"
00:35:58.906,00:36:02.034,Hear what I'm not saying. Don't be fooled.
00:36:02.118,00:36:04.745,I wear a mask. A thousand masks.
00:36:05.454,00:36:10.084,So I play the game. The glittering but empty parade of the masks.
00:36:10.168,00:36:11.836,What is that?
00:36:11.919,00:36:13.880,A poem she wrote.
00:36:19.844,00:36:21.512,"Grandma, this is awesome!"
00:36:21.971,00:36:24.098,"Whatever you want, honey, take."
00:36:25.224,00:36:29.729,Directions for making things. By Joanne Germanotta.
00:36:31.147,00:36:31.981,"Oh, look at that."
00:36:32.064,00:36:36.110,Joseph Germanotta was lent one superball.
00:36:39.447,00:36:40.740,borrowed something.
00:36:43.534,00:36:53.794,"She would make him stop letting-- She had a great sense of humor, I tell you."
00:36:55.046,00:36:56.505,She was a joy.
00:36:57.632,00:37:00.301,I got her for the 19 years.
00:37:04.931,00:37:06.807,-That's good. -So...
00:37:08.100,00:37:09.810,You want to play the song for her?
00:37:11.395,00:37:12.813,You ready to hear it?
00:37:13.564,00:37:14.649,I guess.
00:37:14.732,00:37:19.779,"It won't be as good quality because it's just from my phone, but-- It's all right."
00:37:22.281,00:37:27.119,"So we'll just play it, and then if you get upset, we don't have to talk about it. We'll-- you know?"
00:37:27.203,00:37:28.788,It's okay. We can just...
00:37:30.539,00:37:32.416,"Honey, it's been a long time."
00:37:33.417,00:37:37.838,"I know. I just wanted to be sens-- -It's been over 40 years, so... -I know."
00:37:38.172,00:37:40.216,I know. I just want to be sensitive.
00:38:10.621,00:38:12.540,-She made that one? -Yeah.
00:39:50.554,00:39:52.306,That's a beautiful piece.
00:39:53.432,00:39:55.393,-Really. -You like it?
00:39:58.729,00:40:00.064,That's beautiful.
00:40:02.817,00:40:03.692,Thanks.
00:40:04.485,00:40:06.404,I wrote it for you and Dad.
00:40:06.904,00:40:08.406,"Oh, my dear."
00:40:10.783,00:40:11.992,You are...
00:40:13.160,00:40:14.954,You're just so special.
00:40:18.290,00:40:19.583,Anyway...
00:40:20.167,00:40:21.961,Thanks for listening to it.
00:40:22.044,00:40:23.129,I love you.
00:40:26.215,00:40:28.008,"-Did I get it right? -Yes, you did."
00:40:28.092,00:40:29.343,Okay.
00:40:30.261,00:40:31.345,Good one.
00:40:34.515,00:40:36.517,"-I'll miss you. -Good luck with all this, dear."
00:40:36.600,00:40:38.269,-Yeah. -And don't...
00:40:39.687,00:40:42.523,don't become maudlin over all this.
00:40:42.606,00:40:43.941,It's a long time.
00:40:45.109,00:40:47.778,And for the 19 years that we had her...
00:40:48.821,00:40:53.909,"she was precious, and she's not been forgotten, ever."
00:40:53.993,00:40:55.369,-Okay. -Okay?
00:40:59.123,00:41:01.000,"All right, let's hit the road."
00:41:01.083,00:41:03.544,"All right, let's get stoned in Grandma's car."
00:41:10.426,00:41:12.344,and he is celebrating in a big way.
00:41:15.598,00:41:29.653,"for a special music and light show that will feature-- -Could you grab me a towel, Tyler? -Yes."
00:41:29.737,00:41:30.654,Thank you.
00:41:32.865,00:41:34.241,-Washcloth. -Okay.
00:41:43.083,00:41:47.004,It's the whole right side of my body. It's in a...
00:41:47.087,00:41:48.881,"I don't know, a spasm."
00:41:51.091,00:41:58.265,"It feels like there's a rope pulling from my, like, first toe all up my leg into my..."
00:42:00.976,00:42:02.144,and then...
00:42:03.812,00:42:05.856,around my first rib...
00:42:07.316,00:42:08.817,into my shoulder.
00:42:08.901,00:42:10.444,"And then, my neck."
00:42:11.904,00:42:14.490,"And head, jaw."
00:42:15.407,00:42:17.701,My fucking face hurts.
00:42:19.495,00:42:20.788,Just breathe.
00:42:24.625,00:42:35.636,"I just think about other people that, like, have maybe something like this, that are struggling to figure out what it is, and they don't have the quick money to have somebody help them."
00:42:35.719,00:42:42.017,Like I don't know what I'd fucking do if I didn't have everybody here to help me. What the hell would I do?
00:42:55.990,00:42:57.700,I'm so embarrassed.
00:43:01.829,00:43:05.124,"And I don't even know, like, what a childbirth will be like."
00:43:06.208,00:43:08.168,Or if I can.
00:43:08.252,00:43:09.837,I know I think I can get pregnant.
00:43:09.920,00:43:13.799,"I just don't know, like, what are my hips going to do? I don't fucking know."
00:43:15.801,00:43:18.637,"I'm not afraid of, like, those things like..."
00:43:20.806,00:43:24.018,getting pregnant and becoming older with my fans.
00:43:24.101,00:43:25.227,I'm excited.
00:43:25.311,00:43:28.355,I want to become an old rock star lady.
00:43:33.569,00:43:36.030,"Here, let's put Trump on. That'll knock me out."
00:43:40.200,00:43:43.954,All you need to knock you out of your trauma is to be further traumatized.
00:43:45.289,00:43:47.583,Put on the RNC speech.
00:44:35.214,00:44:37.424,"-Hello. -Hi, Bobby."
00:44:37.508,00:44:41.553,We got 15 minutes and you're out the door.
00:44:43.681,00:44:45.307,"Oh, but I love this hat."
00:44:45.933,00:44:47.017,With this dress.
00:44:56.193,00:44:58.612,-Are they done with the suit? -Yeah. We don't need to wear gloves.
00:44:58.695,00:45:01.532,"I have them if you want them, but with the hat you don't need it."
00:45:01.615,00:45:03.700,I think leave it for right now. We only have 40 minutes.
00:45:03.784,00:45:05.869,"-Yeah, let's just be quick. -Let me blow dry it real quick."
00:45:05.953,00:45:07.663,Right? And then later we can wear it down.
00:45:07.746,00:45:10.916,"-All right. -Really, is that doable with our time?"
00:45:15.379,00:45:16.880,What kind of lip now?
00:45:17.047,00:45:19.883,"Just, like, natural. Just natural and nude."
00:45:20.801,00:45:23.303,"Yeah, I really like the ones you showed me earlier."
00:45:23.387,00:45:26.932,"I talked to Brendan this morning, we have September 9th as the date."
00:45:27.015,00:45:28.642,-September 9th? -Officially.
00:45:30.060,00:45:31.270,Five weeks from Friday.
00:45:31.728,00:45:32.729,Buckle up.
00:45:34.356,00:45:36.150,September 9th the single comes out.
00:45:40.696,00:45:41.655,It's good.
00:45:43.240,00:45:48.203,"I mean, if you look at me during Artpop, and then now, I think I'm doing better."
00:45:48.287,00:45:52.166,I'm just a woman struggling now instead of a girl.
00:49:57.744,00:50:00.080,"If you have not been to wardrobe, come with me."
00:50:00.914,00:50:03.041,Come with me if you have not been to wardrobe.
00:50:10.298,00:50:12.008,That's what I'm trying to find out.
00:50:13.135,00:50:14.136,Okay.
00:50:16.596,00:50:20.809,"Apple box, water, umbrella."
00:50:28.358,00:50:30.610,A mat for her to sit on.
00:50:30.694,00:50:32.154,You hold on. Just sit still.
00:50:33.029,00:50:34.614,Yeah? It's just up and down.
00:51:17.324,00:51:21.244,"What did it feel like? Did it cramp up, or did it twitch or shoot?"
00:51:21.328,00:51:22.662,-Or what'd it do? -It's...
00:51:23.163,00:51:24.456,It's inflamed.
00:51:24.956,00:51:28.043,I'm okay with it. I've accepted it.
00:51:28.126,00:51:34.633,"But sorry, but for the three takes later when the sun looks that beautiful, I just want to do one more."
00:51:34.716,00:51:38.178,"Okay, and remember we need everyone to vibe and just have a good time."
00:51:38.261,00:51:41.181,"Like we don't need anybody, like, dancing and giving me You Got Served."
00:51:41.264,00:51:42.557,This is not that party.
00:51:44.810,00:51:47.938,"This is, Let's go to outer space and lift off. Okay?"
00:51:50.273,00:51:51.233,Let's go!
00:52:23.557,00:52:30.814,"Do you think that, like, some of my older fans are going to be disappointed that I'm not all dressed up?"
00:52:30.897,00:52:35.986,"I think everyone's going to be so excited that it's just, like, solely about feeling it, you know?"
00:52:36.069,00:52:38.321,Without anything to cover it up.
00:52:38.405,00:52:45.871,"It's not about, like, me being out in the front with my hair blowing in the wind, with some high fashion on, you know what I mean?"
00:52:48.874,00:52:50.125,So much.
00:53:00.176,00:53:01.720,Three years.
00:53:05.140,00:53:06.308,"Yeah, Dad."
00:53:08.351,00:53:11.271,The bus-- Germanotta bus stories are beginning.
00:53:27.495,00:53:32.459,"That is Perfect Illusion on-- New Lady Gaga, Perfect Illusion."
00:53:32.542,00:53:34.252,World premiere.
00:53:34.878,00:53:36.671,We got a lot of questions from the fans.
00:53:43.136,00:53:45.639,This is from... A lot of people dance in this one.
00:54:24.135,00:54:27.514,-Are you getting any work done? -Yeah. All of it.
00:54:28.223,00:54:32.310,-We haven't left here in 96 hours. -All of it?
00:54:34.646,00:54:38.608,"It's not like I went to, like, somebody's apartment and got this drug."
00:54:38.692,00:54:41.111,Are you ready? Can you make sure no one comes from that way?
00:54:41.194,00:54:42.028,Okay.
00:54:42.904,00:54:44.239,"Oh, good job."
00:54:44.322,00:54:45.156,Sorry.
00:54:52.914,00:54:56.251,"-I know, I've got you yelling at me... -I'm not yelling."
00:54:56.334,00:55:12.225,"Hey. Don't you dare tell me I'm yelling at you right now. I'm-- How we doing, girls?"
00:55:12.308,00:55:13.727,The record's due at 8:00.
00:55:25.905,00:55:28.450,"-Are you in pain? -Well, my panic attack has ended."
00:55:28.533,00:55:29.367,Good.
00:55:30.910,00:55:32.829,Can Sarah just ride with me?
00:55:32.912,00:55:34.998,Yeah. There's just a lot of people outside.
00:55:35.081,00:55:37.083,"Okay, go ahead then. Sorry. Record."
00:55:41.504,00:55:43.214,"I love you. Ruth, you're the shit."
00:56:05.820,00:56:08.573,"-Can I please have a picture? -Gaga, can I please get a photo?"
00:56:10.700,00:56:11.993,"Please, Gaga!"

00:56:44.442,00:56:46.277,"-Mommy, is it-- Mommy. -Gaga."
00:56:48.905,00:56:52.242,"Gaga, you're so fucking beautiful and I fucking love you!"
00:56:59.415,00:57:00.792,Mommy.
00:57:01.543,00:57:02.752,Gaga!

00:57:06.047,00:57:08.091,Gaga! Gaga!
00:57:26.568,00:57:29.279,"Hey, Mommy. Can you sign this for me?"

00:58:15.283,00:58:21.247,"The high end, bringing out the high end and everything, and, like, making it just more bright and shiny."
00:58:21.331,00:58:22.165,Okay.
00:58:22.248,00:58:23.374,-Play it. -Cool.

00:58:30.840,00:58:32.550,Can you put it on some different speakers?
00:58:35.720,00:58:37.305,What is wrong with me?
00:58:38.264,00:58:45.230,"Well, the last thing anyone will have in their head after this, -Hey girl! anyway, so... -Right. Forever."
00:58:50.735,00:58:51.736,That's good.
00:58:54.822,00:59:02.247,"I don't want to go, but Randy, I feel pretty confident you know what we like now, and Gaga, you can be here to..."
00:59:03.039,00:59:05.166,"-Cool. -All right, I got to run."
00:59:05.250,00:59:10.797,"I'll speak to you tomorrow, and the next day, and everything, because we're going to be obviously still sorting all this shit out."
00:59:12.840,00:59:14.384,"Sorry, I'm a girl."
00:59:14.467,00:59:16.386,What are you talking about?
00:59:19.764,00:59:20.723,All right.
00:59:23.268,00:59:26.521,"I'm sorry, I'm a neurotic Jew. Physical affection makes me feel awkward."
00:59:26.604,00:59:29.482,Okay. I know. I know it does.
00:59:29.566,00:59:30.692,Just deal with it.
00:59:35.530,00:59:36.614,That's awesome.
00:59:36.698,00:59:38.449,Bye.
00:59:39.701,00:59:41.327,-I'll walk you outside. -Okay.
00:59:55.300,00:59:58.386,I burst into tears properly when Mark left.
00:59:59.596,01:00:01.681,But now it's kind of funny though.
01:00:03.600,01:00:05.476,Are you going to be able to sleep tonight?
01:00:26.039,01:00:30.126,And I'm going to fight like fucking hell for them to fucking love this.
01:00:30.209,01:00:32.629,-Yeah. -Because it is lovable.
01:00:36.174,01:00:37.342,Audio.
01:00:41.471,01:00:43.222,"Hey, Long Island. Hey, West Palm."

01:02:04.929,01:02:07.306,"You're going to stand in the middle here for your piece, okay?"
01:02:07.390,01:02:09.851,"You'll just come stand on this, right there. How you doing today?"
01:02:14.397,01:02:16.399,"-Hi. -Oh, my God."

01:02:27.785,01:02:33.750,"-How's it going? -Oh, my God. It's going-- My favorite song of yours is definitely Born This Way."
01:02:34.083,01:02:43.342,"I think it's really inspiring, and whenever I'm feeling down or anything, I go and put that track on, and it, you know, inspires me."
01:02:43.426,01:02:46.137,-I'm so glad you love it. Thank you. -It's one of my favorites.
01:02:46.220,01:02:48.181,All right. We're all-- Cut.
01:02:48.264,01:02:49.599,-And then... -Nice meeting you.
01:02:50.308,01:02:57.106,"I know that it's just for this radio thing that they brought you in, but, like, it really is so sweet that you wait outside for me."
01:02:57.190,01:02:58.816,This means so much to me.
01:03:00.485,01:03:04.989,I'm glad we captured the moment. I'll bring you back out.

01:03:08.618,01:03:11.704,Don't forget her name and give her tickets to a show.
01:03:11.788,01:03:20.755,"Thank you so much for being you and for your music and everything, and I'm so glad I met you, and it's seriously a dream come true, and thank you for everything."
01:03:21.589,01:03:26.844,"She's one of the few that actually, like, genuinely cares about her fans, and that's why I love her."
01:03:30.389,01:03:31.682,Sorry.
01:03:40.149,01:03:42.735,"You can tell, because there's no other option."

01:03:48.866,01:03:51.077,What happened in the last five years?
01:03:52.161,01:03:59.836,"To everyone else, the world is yours, and yet, I think people, real fans, probably knew deep down that there was something going on."
01:03:59.919,01:04:02.046,-It make you paranoid? Did you ever-- -Yes.
01:04:02.129,01:04:04.173,"-Yeah. -Paranoia, fear."

01:04:19.647,01:04:23.109,"Let's not say marriage. But yeah, very painful."
01:04:26.988,01:04:35.746,"It's hard enough when, you know, love isn't working out the way you want it to and you got to walk down the street and have somebody go, You okay?"
01:04:36.247,01:04:39.375,I had to go into the deepest pain in my life.
01:04:39.750,01:04:44.088,I had to go into the part of myself that you don't want to face.
01:04:46.090,01:04:48.467,the biggest change we've seen in Gaga history.
01:04:48.551,01:04:55.224,-We're going to think of this new single? -How does it feel to-- What was going through your head?
01:04:57.393,01:05:02.356,"It's scary, because, you know, you just don't-- If they don't like it, it's like, Well..."
01:05:03.024,01:05:03.983,It's my...
01:05:05.902,01:05:07.486,"It's my life. You know, my life."
01:05:07.570,01:05:12.283,I can't wait for you to hear. It's very personal in a way I just haven't been.
01:05:12.366,01:05:14.243,It's so personal. It's a very personal title.
01:05:14.327,01:05:16.329,When it comes to revealing something so personal about my...
01:05:16.412,01:05:18.664,I've never been that personal with my fans.
01:05:19.248,01:05:25.421,"I don't think that the world was ready to see who I really am, because I wasn't ready to be myself."
01:05:25.504,01:05:27.882,I'm saying this is me with nothing.
01:05:44.565,01:05:53.074,"I just want to make music, and make people happy, and, like, go on tour, and have a family, and, like, I just can never get it all right at the same time."
01:05:55.326,01:06:02.041,I'm always at a shoot with some fucking great news and my love life's imploded.
01:06:08.339,01:06:15.179,"When I looked in that camera today and I saw my eyes were dead, why do you think I was, like, so freaked out?"
01:06:18.641,01:06:22.728,I don't need to have a million wigs on and all that shit to make a statement.
01:06:24.105,01:06:25.982,I know that we want to elevate everything.
01:06:26.065,01:06:29.193,"I'm trying to elevate everything, but, like..."
01:06:30.611,01:06:33.489,I can't elevate it to a...
01:06:33.572,01:06:37.243,I can't elevate it to a point where I become Lady Gaga again.
01:06:37.910,01:06:41.580,"Yeah, because then it's like why even... why did I make this record?"
01:06:48.295,01:06:51.132,"And then I'm like, It's a sad day."
01:06:51.215,01:06:53.467,When it's like I'm doing the Super Bowl.
01:06:53.551,01:07:03.519,"I'm like... I'm so excited to do it, but I can't help but realize that when I sold ten million records, I lost Matt."
01:07:04.603,01:07:07.940,"I sell 30 million, I lose Luc. You know?"
01:07:08.024,01:07:11.569,"I get the movie, I lose Taylor. It's like a turnover."
01:07:14.739,01:07:18.159,This is the third time I've had my heart broken like this.
01:07:26.542,01:07:29.712,"But like, I'm just-- I'm alone, Brandon, every night."
01:07:30.880,01:07:32.715,And all these people will leave.
01:07:33.799,01:07:36.510,Right? They will leave.
01:07:36.594,01:07:37.887,And then I'll be alone.
01:07:37.970,01:07:45.061,And I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence.
01:08:15.091,01:08:17.635,The entire album has reportedly leaked online.
01:08:24.517,01:08:26.393,selling the album early leading to the leak.
01:08:35.444,01:08:39.532,Because a record store in Belgium decided to sell the album early.
01:08:51.418,01:08:53.504,If you could just bring me up to date.
01:08:55.047,01:08:59.135,"I have this, like, real strong, uh..."
01:09:00.261,01:09:01.679,-Like... -Tension?
01:09:01.762,01:09:09.895,"It's tension in my abdomen. It almost-- It just feels like my muscles are, like, gripping all around my intestines."
01:09:09.979,01:09:12.148,-And it's so inflamed. -Yep.
01:09:12.773,01:09:15.234,And my hip hurts every single day.
01:09:16.819,01:09:19.238,-Know your meds off the top of your head? -Yeah.
01:09:19.321,01:09:20.990,-Okay. -Okay.
01:09:21.407,01:09:24.326,"Synthroid for thyroid, but that's not related."
01:09:24.410,01:09:27.872,I'm also on Mobic-- Mobics twice a day.
01:09:46.682,01:09:50.769,I have chased this pain down for five years.
01:09:51.687,01:10:00.070,And the fury in all of this is that -I'm fucking strong and I can still be me. -Yep.
01:10:00.154,01:10:05.826,"And when I feel the adrenaline in my music and my fans, -like, I can fucking go. -Right."
01:10:05.910,01:10:08.287,-But it doesn't mean I'm not in pain. -Right.
01:10:08.871,01:10:17.546,"It sounds like you've been willing your body to perform, so in order to function, you're going to have to shut down pain and emotions -in order to do your job. -Right."
01:10:17.630,01:10:20.174,-But I didn't know I was doing that. -Right.
01:10:20.674,01:10:23.761,-I was on tour in 2012. -Okay.
01:10:23.844,01:10:26.889,"And not feeling good, but I-- Everything hurt."
01:10:26.972,01:10:31.810,-Yeah. -Like I didn't know it was in-- -I didn't know. It's just everything-- -Right. Global pain.
01:10:31.894,01:10:33.187,-Global pain. -Yeah.
01:10:33.270,01:10:35.773,-And mental pain. -Yeah.
01:10:35.856,01:10:37.983,"-Yeah, and then my hip broke. -Okay."
01:10:38.067,01:10:39.610,"Okay, so let's do this."
01:10:39.693,01:10:51.247,"So phase one is let's try to get you-- get out of this intense pain that's in your face, where you feel you're running from the tide all the time, and I know there's a component of psych that Dr. Modir is working on."
01:10:51.330,01:10:54.708,"Phase two, let's try to get the muscles to reeducate."
01:10:54.792,01:10:58.879,"Phase three, we do the blood spinning to try to cause regeneration."
01:10:58.963,01:10:59.838,-Okay. -Okay?
01:10:59.922,01:11:02.967,"So, I'll be back, and then I'll talk you through the procedure, okay?"
01:11:03.509,01:11:05.094,Do you have any questions for me?
01:11:22.278,01:11:25.072,"Hi, Dr. Katja, it's Stefani."
01:11:25.155,01:11:27.950,I'm at Dr. Aufiero's office.
01:11:28.033,01:11:32.246,And she wants to do the trigger point injections.
01:11:34.415,01:11:37.418,"It's just-- Anyway, here's the doctor."
01:11:38.419,01:11:40.129,"Hi, it's Dr. Aufiero."
01:11:40.212,01:11:43.340,"Hi. I'm good. Yeah, you can call me Danielle."
01:11:43.424,01:11:54.310,"Who gets their makeup done while they're getting, -like, a major body treatment? -Yes, I can. So, just-- While this is all occurring, my album is hemorrhaging all over the internet."
01:12:03.485,01:12:06.155,"So we'll do about four spots, okay?"
01:12:10.826,01:12:11.994,You're doing great.
01:12:15.331,01:12:16.415,Almost there.
01:12:17.291,01:12:21.003,"The tighter the muscle, it's more intense. Just the needle coming in."
01:12:21.086,01:12:22.129,A little cold spray.
01:12:30.262,01:12:31.263,It's not right.
01:12:35.976,01:12:45.277,This is what I've been waiting to see while I sit in that fucking MRI machine for three hours at a time and they tell me to take Advil and Aleve.
01:12:49.281,01:12:52.201,"You know, whatever. Fuck it. Let them download my record."
01:12:52.284,01:12:53.619,I don't fucking care.
01:12:57.581,01:12:59.500,"I mean, I don't fucking care."
01:13:26.652,01:13:29.113,"If I cry, will my face get puffy?"
01:15:03.040,01:15:08.003,and the singer wants everyone to know that songs are a radical departure from the pop that launched her into fame.
01:15:09.963,01:15:13.258,has debuted at the top of the US Billboard 200 album chart.
01:15:26.104,01:15:27.356,"Gilberto, yes."
01:15:30.984,01:15:33.111,-Will you sign my arm? -Thank you so much.
01:15:33.195,01:15:35.113,I don't cry over anybody.
01:15:35.197,01:15:40.827,"But this is a journey, and this is a long time coming, and this girl has my heart. I fucking-- I love her."
01:15:40.911,01:15:43.914,"The tattoo I got, I'm beautiful my way because God makes no mistakes."
01:16:51.523,01:16:54.234,Hello? Hello?
01:16:58.363,01:17:00.490,-Hi. How are you? -Hi.
01:17:00.574,01:17:04.995,"I was just wondering, do you have the new Lady Gaga album?"
01:17:05.078,01:17:07.623,-I'm sorry? -Do you have the new Lady Gaga album?
01:17:08.540,01:17:09.791,The new lady named what?
01:17:09.875,01:17:12.085,Lady Gaga album.
01:17:12.169,01:17:14.379,-Oh! Do we have that-- -Yeah.
01:17:15.756,01:17:18.425,It would be somewhere around here.
01:17:18.508,01:17:20.010,Can I talk to the manager?
01:17:20.802,01:17:25.015,"Yeah, if you go to the customer service. Maybe they can help you out. Yes."
01:17:25.098,01:17:27.142,-Where is that? -Customer service.
01:17:27.225,01:17:29.561,-All the way in the front. -Okay.
01:17:29.645,01:17:31.021,"Oh, you found it?"
01:17:31.104,01:17:32.189,Thank you.
01:17:33.940,01:17:35.317,This is all they have?
01:17:47.329,01:17:48.997,-Should we buy two? -Yeah.
01:17:52.000,01:17:53.168,He's our manager.
01:17:53.251,01:17:56.755,"Oh, hey. I just wanted to know if you had more of these in the back."
01:17:56.838,01:17:59.800,"I can check for you, but I don't want to be recorded."
01:17:59.883,01:18:02.636,"I'm sorry, but we can't record in the store, okay?"
01:18:02.719,01:18:03.929,-That's cool. -Let me check for you.
01:18:04.012,01:18:05.305,-Thanks. -Not a problem.
01:18:05.931,01:18:06.848,Excuse me.
01:18:08.684,01:18:10.811,"Oh, it is. Oh, hi."
01:18:10.894,01:18:13.271,-I'm sorry. I didn't know. -It's okay.
01:18:14.981,01:18:16.817,Thank you for choosing our Walmart to shop at.
01:18:16.900,01:18:21.446,"Oh, yeah, no, we were just coming to check on it, because, you know, the record business is tough, you know?"
01:18:21.530,01:18:23.740,"So, I want to make sure our CDs are out in front."
01:18:23.824,01:18:24.658,Absolutely.
01:18:24.741,01:18:26.618,"-Can I take a picture with you? -Yeah, okay."
01:18:26.702,01:18:29.287,"Hey, can you take a picture of us? I want to show my wife."
01:18:29.371,01:18:31.289,I thought I was in trouble.
01:18:33.250,01:18:35.836,"All right, so let's check if we have the CDs for Lady Gaga."
01:18:35.919,01:18:37.879,"Okay, who's going to take a picture?"
01:18:39.214,01:18:40.173,She asked me first.
01:18:40.257,01:18:41.508,Lady Gaga?
01:18:53.061,01:18:54.604,"Can we take a picture with you, please?"
01:18:58.650,01:18:59.943,There's a lane open up there.
01:19:00.026,01:19:02.237,-Lady Gaga? -Yeah.
01:19:14.583,01:19:15.542,Thank you.
01:19:20.505,01:19:21.631,"-Bye, guys. -Bye, guys."
01:19:21.715,01:19:23.300,Thank you for shopping with us.
01:19:28.513,01:19:32.267,-Have you ever seen that pink hat? -We fucked that shit up. Yes!
01:19:39.024,01:19:41.401,I am a regular girl!
01:19:42.569,01:19:44.488,-Do I look like a nerd? -No.
01:20:24.110,01:20:25.403,It happened three times in a row.
01:20:25.487,01:20:28.281,Let's start at our height and we'll adjust if we have to.
01:20:28.365,01:20:29.241,Thank you.
01:20:32.828,01:20:34.579,"Oh, my God. So it's like..."
01:20:35.664,01:20:40.502,It's just so distracting that things are not right...
01:20:40.919,01:20:41.962,-for me. -Right.
01:20:42.045,01:20:45.131,I can't perform it until everything else is locked.
01:20:45.215,01:20:49.427,-Otherwise I'm just erasing mistakes. -Yeah.
01:20:49.511,01:20:55.350,"If I pick up the keytar and I play the wrong note in front of a hundred million people, that's my fault."
01:20:55.934,01:20:58.228,Doesn't matter that someone else screwed it up. It's my name.
01:20:59.479,01:21:02.315,Who told Ian to put-- Did you tell Ian to do the change?
01:21:02.399,01:21:04.776,"-Yes. -Okay, I just need someone to tell me."
01:21:04.860,01:21:10.282,"-Okay, sorry. That was-- -I just have no-- I had no idea, and then, the-- Did you guys change the skirt?"
01:21:10.866,01:21:14.870,-The skirt? -It-- The belt?
01:21:14.953,01:21:17.747,-Did you add... -We put the belt on.
01:21:17.831,01:21:20.125,Did you add another latch to the belt in the back?
01:21:20.208,01:21:22.878,-The belt has a latch in the back. -Okay.
01:21:23.503,01:21:26.882,That was my fault. I just felt like those girls were just not getting it.
01:21:26.965,01:21:28.717,-They're both-- Nobody's getting it. -Right.
01:21:28.800,01:21:36.224,"Right now I'm doing full passes of a show feeling like shit, with everything being like falling all over the place around me."
01:21:36.308,01:21:38.018,So it's just a waste of time.
01:21:38.101,01:21:40.395,"As a performer, I'm going, What are we doing?"
01:21:40.478,01:21:45.066,"Like, I would rather have nothing on and be like, One, two, three."
01:21:45.150,01:21:59.956,"Just practicing the jacket and getting it right, so that I can feel-- Because the thing is, is when those things are happening, I'm setting up my breath, and I'm getting my mind ready to set the note right for this moment so I can-- and I-- Right now, like, I'm not finding the cameras."
01:22:00.040,01:22:03.668,"When I'm supposed to find the cameras, because I'm like, Wait. Where am I?"
01:22:03.752,01:22:05.337,And I'm dizzy out there.
01:22:05.420,01:22:06.838,"I mean, that's a 360 room."
01:22:06.922,01:22:10.634,"It's not like I have a backdrop to go, Oh, here's the back of the stage."
01:22:10.717,01:22:13.845,"Like, when I get turned around, I'm legit, like, I don't know where I am."
01:22:15.972,01:22:19.059,"This lining is not going to work, and I just-- We're changing it."
01:22:19.142,01:22:23.521,"Okay, but they need to change it like now, because I have to rehearse with it and..."
01:22:24.814,01:22:31.696,"This is making me nervous, is-- I know to other people it's like, Oh, no big deal. It's just a lining of a jacket."
01:22:31.780,01:22:41.081,"But for me, it's like, the way that the fabric on my outfit reacts to this fabric, whatever that it is, is going to change the speed in which my arm enters the sleeve."
01:22:41.164,01:22:42.457,It's like a whole thing.
01:22:42.540,01:22:46.878,So every little thing that's not done means more work for me Friday.
01:22:46.962,01:22:50.173,Means less time for me to rehearse my performance.
01:22:51.466,01:22:53.343,-Everyone's tired. -Okay.
01:22:54.260,01:22:55.595,Those dancers are tired.
01:22:55.679,01:22:59.557,"I'm sorry, but I know those dancers. They're fucking tired."
01:24:17.886,01:24:20.138,Feel my hip. Just put your hands on there.
01:24:21.890,01:24:23.433,"I mean, it's for real."
01:24:23.516,01:24:25.060,Like I'm locked up.
01:24:25.560,01:24:28.480,Are you getting a little-- It's when I'm hitting-- That's what's hard right now.
01:24:28.563,01:24:33.568,I just don't want it to like-- I don't want to complain about it. I just want to fix it.
01:24:53.046,01:24:55.465,Am I grabbing your boob? I can't see.
01:24:56.841,01:24:59.344,-Is that your shoulder? -Yeah. That's my shoulder.
01:25:37.173,01:25:38.216,"Hey, guys."
01:25:38.842,01:25:40.885,This is the last one. Okay?
01:25:40.969,01:25:43.138,So this is the stamina run.
01:25:43.221,01:25:48.476,"This is when you think you can't, and you like need to, like, take a little, like, extra breath here or there."
01:25:48.560,01:25:49.644,You don't.
01:25:50.270,01:25:51.938,"You push through it, right?"
01:25:52.021,01:25:55.024,You got to maintain your own sense of your spirit.
01:25:55.108,01:25:57.610,"So when you're out there now, focus on you."
01:25:57.694,01:26:01.906,You know? It can get very distracting out there with everything that's going on.
01:26:01.990,01:26:02.907,So just...
01:26:02.991,01:26:07.162,This one is about staying grounded and biting it hard. Okay?
01:28:54.662,01:28:56.706,"-Did she see this? -No, she hasn't seen it."
01:28:56.789,01:28:58.249,I'm so excited.
01:29:00.460,01:29:01.377,How cute is that?
01:29:01.461,01:29:04.339,"Oh, my! There's lots of flowers."
01:29:29.030,01:29:33.451,"Well, nothing like getting flowers from your ex-fiancé for the Super Bowl."
01:29:43.961,01:29:44.962,It's okay.
01:29:45.046,01:29:46.214,It's okay.
01:29:47.840,01:29:49.050,Okay.
01:29:49.133,01:29:52.261,"Actually, I will put them out. Nice and proud."
01:29:53.262,01:29:54.222,It's very thoughtful.
01:29:54.889,01:30:01.104,"I want to enjoy the day with my family, but I've really got my eye on the prize."
01:30:01.187,01:30:02.063,After.
01:30:02.772,01:30:04.816,We have after. We have this evening.
01:30:04.899,01:30:09.862,"And I don't feel as, like, angry and tired as I did that other day."
01:30:14.826,01:30:16.244,How is this show different?
01:30:20.498,01:30:24.544,"Well, you know, I've never really done..."
01:30:27.463,01:30:34.095,"like a lifetime achievement, you know, award, or a performance, like..."
01:30:34.387,01:30:38.850,that was meant to celebrate my career.
01:30:39.600,01:30:44.856,And I feel like this is that moment.
01:30:45.648,01:30:52.822,"And I was thinking this morning about it, and the truth is that there really isn't anything bigger than this."
01:30:52.905,01:30:56.701,"So I better enjoy it today, because it's not going to happen again."
01:30:57.160,01:31:09.130,"And the country is so in peril right now and in stress, and I think it's-- this is when it is most important to be an artist, and shine."
01:31:09.213,01:31:12.842,The government doesn't have the power to change anything in music or in art.
01:31:14.886,01:31:18.055,I think everyone's going to read into it what they want to read into it.
01:31:18.139,01:31:20.016,"I mean, that's the way this goes."
01:32:25.998,01:32:28.960,This is the biggest beauty pageant we've ever done!
01:32:30.086,01:32:31.254,-You happy? -Uh-huh.
01:32:31.337,01:32:33.965,"Ashley and I just took a Molly, so we'll probably be a little crazy."
01:32:35.091,01:32:36.217,Yes.
01:32:37.593,01:32:39.136,That's so good.
01:32:39.720,01:32:41.555,You gotta be rolling.
01:32:50.773,01:32:51.941,This is the one.
01:32:53.442,01:32:54.568,Of your life?
01:32:55.444,01:32:56.362,Correct.
01:32:56.445,01:32:58.531,It's almost like a little bit sad.
01:33:00.366,01:33:01.784,"No, it doesn't get bigger than this."
01:33:02.785,01:33:04.328,So what do I do after this?
01:33:04.412,01:33:07.415,Everything. You're about to see your whole world explode at 9:00 p.m. tonight.
01:33:07.498,01:33:08.332,You think so?
01:33:08.416,01:33:11.085,"Your album's already all number one, like, around the world."
01:33:11.168,01:33:13.337,You'll be in stadiums for the rest of your life.
01:33:33.733,01:33:35.109,-We really should... -Okay.
01:33:35.192,01:33:36.319,...start this process.
01:33:37.111,01:33:38.279,This is big.
01:33:38.362,01:33:39.363,It's really big.
01:33:39.447,01:33:41.407,"It's big for me, but it's big for you too."
01:33:41.490,01:33:46.037,This is like a big moment that you've master-managed.
01:33:46.120,01:33:48.331,-It's not easy to manage this. -Yeah.
01:33:48.414,01:33:49.874,And you did it by yourself.
01:33:50.583,01:33:52.877,"-You know, that's what I'm saying. -Thank you."
01:33:52.960,01:33:56.964,-I love you. -Thank you for staying with me.
01:33:57.048,01:33:57.882,You know?
01:34:04.013,01:34:06.724,"-Okay, it's game time. -Yes, it is, Richard."
01:34:06.807,01:34:08.976,"-Let's do it, troops. -Let's do it, troops."
01:34:18.778,01:34:21.280,I'm doing the halftime show.
01:34:22.865,01:34:24.200,We're going to be late!
01:34:26.202,01:34:28.496,We're going to be late for your halftime show.
01:34:30.289,01:34:31.874,I'm doing the halftime show.
01:34:34.168,01:34:35.669,No!
01:34:38.047,01:34:40.257,I just wanted to have a good moment to come say...
01:34:40.341,01:34:42.259,"Oh, my God."
01:34:42.343,01:34:43.886,Yay! We match!
01:34:43.969,01:34:44.804,Oh.
01:34:48.474,01:34:49.892,"I love you, too."
01:34:49.975,01:34:50.851,All right.
01:35:12.790,01:35:14.875,That's George Bush.
01:35:17.628,01:35:19.046,This is Donatella Versace.
01:35:19.130,01:35:20.172,Clear the way!
01:35:22.425,01:35:23.342,Hello.
01:35:37.398,01:35:39.483,I'm sorry. I feel like I'm bothering you now.
01:35:39.567,01:35:41.402,"No, you're not bothering me."
01:35:41.485,01:35:44.363,"-I am so proud of you. -Honey, it's 12 minutes."
01:35:44.447,01:35:47.241,-The last quarter went by really fast. -Okay.
01:35:57.084,01:36:00.296,"Oh, the Janet Jackson nipple covers are going on."
01:36:05.092,01:36:06.302,I am focused.
01:36:06.385,01:36:07.720,I know you are.
01:36:08.387,01:36:14.310,"I bet I watched every rehearsal, and I had one major note for myself, and it was to have fun."
01:36:14.393,01:36:16.479,I look like I want to kill everyone.
01:36:17.021,01:36:18.022,We have five.
01:36:22.234,01:36:23.777,Interception!
01:36:23.861,01:36:26.697,"Oh, my God! No!"
01:36:28.782,01:36:30.701,"Okay, let's get those eyes on."
01:36:33.204,01:36:34.038,Really.
01:36:36.624,01:36:38.292,-Shall we do this? -Yes.
01:36:38.375,01:36:40.836,"-Sorry, guys, we have to go. We-- -We're going right now."
01:36:40.920,01:36:43.047,Yes! Let's do this!
01:36:56.977,01:36:58.521,The roof is opening!
01:37:21.877,01:37:22.711,Last looks!
01:37:29.718,01:37:31.011,"Hey, guys."
01:37:32.096,01:37:38.811,"I don't know about you, but I've been working my whole life for this moment, so I'd like to thank you for all your hard work."
01:37:38.894,01:37:39.812,Thank you.
01:38:05.546,01:38:06.589,-Amazing. -It was good.
01:38:06.672,01:38:09.550,-Amazing. -It was unbelievable. Unbelievable.
01:38:11.552,01:38:14.555,-Extraordinary. -That could not have gone...
01:38:14.638,01:38:20.060,"We got to perform on the biggest stage in the world with our beliefs and our diversity, and I'm really proud of it."
01:38:20.144,01:38:23.147,"I know, it was great. A Million Reasons just went number one."
01:38:23.272,01:38:24.273,No way.
01:38:25.566,01:38:28.193,"So there you go. A Million Reasons, number one."
01:38:28.277,01:38:31.905,Unbelievable.
01:38:33.115,01:38:34.491,"Again, unbelievable."
01:39:25.084,01:39:26.085,Sorry.
01:39:26.543,01:39:29.546,"That was the night that I gave Beyoncé, like, a panic attack."
01:39:31.256,01:39:33.008,How'd you give her a panic attack?
01:39:33.092,01:39:40.516,"I don't know. I just always feel like when I'm with her and Jay-Z, I'm always, like, hanging out in the corner with, like, nine joints hanging out of my mouth, being like, What's up?"
01:39:40.599,01:39:45.688,"And she's just like, You're not a lady. But why? How is this working?"
01:40:14.383,01:40:16.218,So we're going to go right to Mark.
01:40:16.301,01:40:18.929,The first shart should be of-- the shot should be of Mark.
01:40:19.012,01:40:21.098,Mark's hands. Can we go back?
01:40:21.849,01:40:23.684,"Sorry. I said, The first shart."
01:40:24.727,01:40:25.561,Sorry.
01:40:25.644,01:40:27.980,"That's my own business, what happens when I'm..."
00:44:37.508,00:44:39.510,We've got 15 minutes.
00:58:23.917,00:58:25.335,When will we send it?
01:18:16.900,01:18:18.819,"Oh yeah, we were just coming to check on it."
01:18:21.530,01:18:24.241,"So, I want to make sure our CDs are out in front."
01:24:30.482,01:24:33.985,"I don’t want to complain about it, I just want to fix it."
01:35:49.702,01:35:52.037,I don't understand this sport. I'm Italian.
