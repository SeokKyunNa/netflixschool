00:00:13.096,00:00:16.016,from home.
00:00:16.057,00:00:20.061,Children stray from their parents and are never seen again.
00:00:20.103,00:00:25.317,Housewives take the grocery money and a taxi to the train station.
00:00:25.359,00:00:28.236,"Most are found, eventually."
00:00:28.278,00:00:33.241,"Disappearances, after all, have explanations."
00:00:33.283,00:00:34.910,Usually.
00:00:39.999,00:00:42.584,"Strange, the things you remember."
00:00:42.626,00:00:46.129,Single images and feelings that stay with you down through the years.
00:00:47.882,00:00:52.093,"Like the moment I'd realized, I'd never owned a vase."
00:00:52.135,00:00:56.932,That I'd never lived in any place long enough to justify having such a simple thing.
00:00:59.142,00:01:05.357,"And how at that moment, I wanted nothing so much in all the world as to have a vase of my very own."
00:01:09.820,00:01:14.157,"It was a Tuesday afternoon, six months after the end of the war."
00:01:22.708,00:01:24.376,"Oh, God!"
00:01:24.418,00:01:25.544,Hold him.
00:01:25.586,00:01:26.921,Hold him right now!
00:01:26.962,00:01:28.171,WOUNDED SOLDIER: Jesus Christ!
00:01:29.924,00:01:31.174,"You're going home, right?"
00:01:38.057,00:01:39.182,"WOUNDED SOLDIER: Oh, God!"
00:01:39.182,00:01:42.185,CLAIRE: We'll have to clamp the femoral artery before he bleeds out!
00:01:42.185,00:01:44.187,Right.
00:01:44.187,00:01:45.689,"Oh! Oh, my God!"
00:01:50.652,00:01:52.195,"WOUNDED SOLDIER: Oh, Jesus!"
00:01:52.613,00:01:53.948,Move.
00:01:58.535,00:02:00.454,"DOCTOR: We've got him now, nurse."
00:02:03.624,00:02:05.208,DOCTOR: Scalpel!
00:02:26.271,00:02:28.941,Claire! Did you hear?
00:02:28.983,00:02:31.234,"It's really, finally over!"
00:02:33.236,00:02:34.237,Hi!
00:03:05.686,00:03:16.446,"CLAIRE: Somehow, in my mind, V-E Day, the end of the bloodiest and most terrible war in human history, grows fainter with each passing day."
00:03:18.532,00:03:25.706,"But I can still recall every detail of the day, when I saw the life I wanted sitting in a window."
00:03:25.747,00:03:31.294,I sometimes wonder what would have happened if I'd bought that vase and made a home for it.
00:03:31.294,00:03:34.297,Would that have changed things?
00:03:34.297,00:03:38.301,Would I have been happy?
00:03:38.301,00:03:39.887,I do know this.
00:03:39.928,00:03:47.144,"Even now, after all the pain and death and heartbreak that followed, I still would make the same choice."
00:05:30.831,00:05:34.709,CLAIRE: We were in Scotland on our second honeymoon.
00:05:34.751,00:05:37.296,Or at least that's what Frank called it.
00:05:37.420,00:05:41.424,A way to celebrate the end of the war years and begin our lives anew.
00:05:44.427,00:05:47.181,But it was more than that.
00:05:47.222,00:05:56.731,I think we both felt a holiday would be a convenient masquerade for the real business of getting to know the people we'd become after five years apart.
00:06:01.528,00:06:03.697,FRANK: What do you suppose that is?
00:06:03.738,00:06:05.824,"Oh, good Lord. Blood."
00:06:05.866,00:06:08.451,Are you sure?
00:06:08.451,00:06:10.871,I think I should know the look of blood by now.
00:06:10.912,00:06:13.123,There's a stain just like it on the house next door.
00:06:15.458,00:06:17.669,There's two more over there.
00:06:21.464,00:06:25.344,We seem to be surrounded by homes marked with blood.
00:06:25.468,00:06:33.268,Perhaps Pharaoh has refused Moses and the spirit of death will travel the streets of Inverness tonight sparing only those who mark their doors with lamb's blood.
00:06:33.310,00:06:35.478,FRANK: You may be closer than you think.
00:06:35.478,00:06:40.817,"There will be some sort of sacrificial ritual, but it's a bit pagan rather than Hebrew."
00:06:40.859,00:06:43.945,I had no idea Inverness was such a hotbed of contemporary paganism.
00:06:43.987,00:06:49.743,"Well, my dear, there's no place on earth with more magic and superstition mixed into its daily life than the Scottish Highlands."
00:06:51.078,00:06:52.537,Shall we?
00:06:52.579,00:06:54.206,Lead on.
00:07:05.508,00:07:08.511,The blood you saw is that of a black cockerel.
00:07:08.511,00:07:13.975,It's an old custom at this time of year to make such a sacrifice to honor Saint Odhran.
00:07:14.017,00:07:17.520,"Ah! Odhran, he was sainted in the eighth century?"
00:07:18.272,00:07:19.689,You know yer history.
00:07:19.731,00:07:22.525,"I'm afraid my husband is a historian, Mrs. Baird."
00:07:22.525,00:07:25.987,He'll quite happily stand here holding forth for hours if you encourage him.
00:07:26.029,00:07:27.572,"Oh, hardly."
00:07:27.614,00:07:32.535,"Highland folklore is far from my specialty, but am I right in thinking there's an..."
00:07:32.535,00:07:34.955,Is there an old saying associated with Saint Odhran?
00:07:38.708,00:07:41.753,Yes. The Earth went over Odhran's eyes.
00:07:41.795,00:07:45.799,He was buried alive voluntarily.
00:07:45.840,00:07:48.009,Charming.
00:07:48.051,00:07:49.928,"Are ye a professor then, Mr. Randall?"
00:07:49.970,00:07:51.554,I will be soon.
00:07:51.596,00:07:54.766,He's accepted a post at Oxford beginning in two weeks.
00:07:54.808,00:07:59.562,"Ah, then this is a last holiday before settling down to a workaday life again, is it?"
00:07:59.562,00:08:03.191,"Well ye picked a bonnie time to be here, just nigh on Samhain."
00:08:03.233,00:08:06.027,I take it that's Gaelic for Halloween?
00:08:06.069,00:08:08.780,"Well, Halloween is derived from Samhain."
00:08:08.822,00:08:13.576,The Church often took pagan holidays and renamed them for their own purposes.
00:08:13.576,00:08:18.581,"Samhain became Halloween, Yule became Christmas, and so on..."
00:08:18.581,00:08:21.126,"Well, you're both welcome at the festival, of course."
00:08:21.168,00:08:28.591,"Mind you, ghosts are freed on the feast days, and they'll be wandering about, free to do good or ill as they please."
00:08:28.591,00:08:31.052,Of course.
00:08:31.094,00:08:33.596,Samhain be without a good ghost story?
00:08:33.596,00:08:36.975,And we have those for sure.
00:08:44.191,00:08:47.486,"CLAIRE: Before the war, we were inseparable."
00:08:47.610,00:08:52.073,"But for the next five years, we saw each other a grand total of 10 days."
00:08:52.115,00:08:55.243,It's not without its charms.
00:08:55.285,00:08:57.620,Beats an army tent and a cot in the mud.
00:08:57.662,00:08:59.206,Indeed.
00:09:05.628,00:09:12.635,"CLAIRE: When the war ended, we both thought things would return to the way they once were, but they hadn't."
00:09:17.640,00:09:19.642,Gosh!
00:09:19.642,00:09:21.644,So much for marital privacy.
00:09:21.644,00:09:23.646,Do you think the sound carries?
00:09:23.688,00:09:29.110,"Well, I think it's fair to say Mrs. Baird will be kept apprised of any renewed attempts to start a family."
00:09:37.827,00:09:40.705,Lazybones.
00:09:40.747,00:09:44.667,You'll never manage the next branch on your family tree if you don't show more industry than that.
00:09:44.667,00:09:45.835,"Oh, really?"
00:09:50.090,00:09:51.674,What are you doing?
00:09:51.674,00:09:54.469,Come on.
00:09:51.674,00:09:56.763,"Mrs. Randall, what am I to do with you?"
00:09:57.680,00:09:59.682,Right.
00:09:59.682,00:10:01.976,Ridiculous.
00:10:02.018,00:10:03.603,We're gonna break the bed.
00:10:18.034,00:10:27.085,"You know, one of those things I used to try and remember lying in my cot, was the sound of my husband's laugh."
00:10:27.127,00:10:30.213,I couldn't conjure it no matter what I did.
00:10:30.255,00:10:34.675,I couldn't hear it even though I'd heard it a million times before.
00:10:38.430,00:10:41.391,It's the strangest thing.
00:10:44.478,00:10:45.853,"I used to, um..."
00:10:48.064,00:10:49.690,I used to sketch this.
00:10:49.732,00:10:51.318,My hand?
00:10:52.068,00:10:53.653,"The lines, really."
00:10:54.737,00:11:00.285,"Why exactly, I'm not sure, but I had a very clear memory of this...this pattern."
00:11:00.327,00:11:02.745,Made little doodles everywhere.
00:11:04.122,00:11:06.040,There was...
00:11:06.082,00:11:11.505,A brigadier once dressed me down because I'd drew it in the margin of a report for the minister.
00:11:12.213,00:11:13.465,Yeah.
00:11:28.771,00:11:29.814,Claire...
00:11:30.773,00:11:31.774,Shh.
00:12:17.571,00:12:18.821,Happy?
00:12:18.821,00:12:20.198,Yes.
00:12:23.410,00:12:27.581,CLAIRE: Frank's passion for history was another reason for choosing the Highlands.
00:12:27.622,00:12:29.082,You see up there?
00:12:29.123,00:12:31.834,"The top there, that's Cocknammon Rock."
00:12:31.834,00:12:39.842,"And in the 17th and 18th centuries, you'd have often found a British army patrol up there lying in wait for Scottish rebels or brigands."
00:12:39.842,00:12:42.721,You can see how it commands the high ground in every direction?
00:12:42.845,00:12:46.224,It was a perfect position for an ambush.
00:12:46.266,00:12:48.184,CLAIRE: Not that I minded.
00:12:48.226,00:12:51.354,I was raised by my uncle after the death of my parents.
00:12:57.611,00:13:07.036,"CLAIRE: Uncle Lamb was an archeologist, so, I'd spent the balance of my formative years traipsing through dusty ruins and various excavations throughout the world."
00:13:07.078,00:13:14.294,"I'd learned to dig latrines and boil water, and to do a number of other things not suitable for a young lady of gentle birth."
00:13:14.335,00:13:16.254,Uncle?
00:13:16.879,00:13:18.256,Very smart.
00:13:38.109,00:13:41.404,CLAIRE: Frank's new-found passion was genealogy.
00:13:41.446,00:13:43.239,"His personal genealogy, that is."
00:13:44.658,00:13:46.200,Mine was botany.
00:13:46.242,00:13:50.913,I'd developed a keen interest in the use of plants and herbs for medicinal purposes.
00:13:54.417,00:14:03.176,"So, from what I can gather, Castle Leoch was the ancestral home of the Laird of the MacKenzie clan until midway through the 19th century."
00:14:03.217,00:14:04.678,We'll take a look?
00:14:21.820,00:14:28.368,"CLAIRE: In a way, burying himself in the distant past gave Frank an ability to escape the recent."
00:14:28.409,00:14:31.788,"While I was with the army, Frank had served in London."
00:14:31.830,00:14:36.751,"Intelligence, overseeing spies, and running covert operations."
00:14:36.793,00:14:38.961,"So, I think this might have been the kitchen."
00:14:38.961,00:14:40.588,Really?
00:14:40.630,00:14:43.132,I would say that's probably a hearth.
00:14:47.512,00:14:48.763,Yeah.
00:14:52.099,00:14:53.976,Strange.
00:14:53.976,00:14:59.982,"I have no evidence that my ancestor visited this castle, but it was within his operational sphere."
00:14:59.982,00:15:05.071,"So, it is just possible that he walked these very halls."
00:15:08.825,00:15:14.664,"CLAIRE: He'd sent dozens of men behind the lines on secret missions, and most never came back."
00:15:16.207,00:15:20.754,"He didn't talk about it very often, but I knew it preyed on him."
00:15:55.538,00:15:57.373,It won't open.
00:15:58.207,00:16:00.543,Come on.
00:16:00.585,00:16:02.670,"Three, two, one..."
00:16:37.121,00:16:39.707,What do you think this was used for?
00:16:39.749,00:16:47.590,"From the lack of proper lighting and ventilation, I would say province of the castle hermit."
00:16:47.632,00:16:49.676,Or perhaps a troll or two.
00:16:52.261,00:16:53.847,I don't think trolls live in pairs.
00:16:55.598,00:16:57.391,"Solitary creatures, they."
00:16:59.811,00:17:00.812,It's a pity.
00:17:02.981,00:17:06.233,"All this, and no one to share it with."
00:17:11.990,00:17:12.991,You'll get dirty.
00:17:14.868,00:17:16.744,You can give me a bath.
00:17:35.555,00:17:40.226,"Why, Mrs. Randall, I do believe you've left your undergarments at home."
00:17:40.267,00:17:41.268,Hmm.
00:18:18.180,00:18:21.183,FRANK: Yes!
00:18:21.183,00:18:22.852,I found him.
00:18:22.894,00:18:24.395,Let us have a look.
00:18:24.437,00:18:27.189,Him? Is it Walter?
00:18:27.231,00:18:30.777,"No, darling, Jonathan."
00:18:30.818,00:18:36.198,"Captain of dragoons in the British army, and your direct ancestor."
00:18:36.198,00:18:37.324,Exactly.
00:18:37.366,00:18:39.201,Otherwise known as Black Jack.
00:18:39.201,00:18:43.706,A rather dashing nickname that he probably acquired while he was stationed here in the 1740s.
00:18:43.748,00:18:48.502,The Reverend has found a series of army dispatches that mention the Captain by name.
00:18:48.544,00:18:50.546,Mmm. It is.
00:18:50.588,00:18:52.214,Good to see all your sleuthing over the past week has paid off.
00:18:52.214,00:18:53.466,Hmm.
00:18:53.507,00:18:55.217,"Yes, I was beginning to wonder."
00:18:55.217,00:19:00.056,It appears Black Jack commanded the garrison at Fort William for four years or so.
00:19:00.098,00:19:04.226,Seems to have spent quite a bit of his time harassing the Scottish countryside on behalf of the Crown.
00:19:04.268,00:19:07.229,"Well, he was hardly alone in that endeavor."
00:19:07.229,00:19:10.232,The English were deeply unpopular throughout the Highlands in the 18th century.
00:19:10.232,00:19:12.234,"And well into the 20th, it would seem."
00:19:12.234,00:19:18.240,I distinctly heard the barman at that pub last night refer to us as Sassenachs.
00:19:18.240,00:19:20.242,I hope you didn't take offense.
00:19:20.242,00:19:25.247,"It only means Englishman, after all, or at worst, Outlander."
00:19:25.289,00:19:26.833,Mmm.
00:19:26.874,00:19:29.085,"I've brought you a wee bit of refreshment, gentlemen."
00:19:29.127,00:19:34.256,"I've brought but the two cups, for I thought perhaps Mrs. Randall might care to join me in the kitchen..."
00:19:34.256,00:19:37.844,"Yes. Yes, absolutely."
00:19:40.680,00:19:42.264,See you later.
00:19:46.769,00:19:48.604,Is this supposed to be here?
00:19:50.314,00:19:53.109,Ah! It's been so long since I've had a good cup Oolong.
00:19:53.151,00:19:56.278,"Aye, I couldn't get it during the war."
00:19:58.322,00:20:00.491,"It's the best for the readings, though."
00:20:00.533,00:20:03.202,"Oh, I had a terrible time with that Earl Grey."
00:20:03.243,00:20:06.330,"The leaves fall apart so fast, it's hard to tell anything at all."
00:20:10.877,00:20:13.087,"So, you read tea leaves, then?"
00:20:13.129,00:20:15.464,Like my grandmother taught me.
00:20:15.506,00:20:18.258,And her grandmother before that.
00:20:18.300,00:20:20.511,Drink up your cup.
00:20:33.399,00:20:38.071,"Well, am I going to meet a tall, dark stranger and take a trip across the sea?"
00:20:38.112,00:20:39.155,Could be.
00:20:40.322,00:20:41.782,Or could not.
00:20:44.326,00:20:47.329,Everything in it is contradictory.
00:20:47.371,00:20:55.046,"There's the curved leaf, which indicates a journey, but it's crossed by the broken one, which means staying put."
00:20:55.088,00:20:56.089,Hmm.
00:20:57.631,00:21:01.343,"And there are strangers there, to be sure, several of them."
00:21:01.385,00:21:04.471,"And one of them's your husband, if I read the leaves all right."
00:21:06.390,00:21:08.059,"Show me your hand, dear."
00:21:14.398,00:21:15.357,Odd.
00:21:16.692,00:21:18.611,Most hands have a likeness to them.
00:21:18.652,00:21:20.404,"There are patterns, you know?"
00:21:20.446,00:21:24.867,But this is a pattern I've not seen before.
00:21:29.371,00:21:31.665,"The large thumb, now?"
00:21:31.707,00:21:36.378,"Means that you're strong-minded, and you have a will not easily crossed."
00:21:37.421,00:21:40.091,And this is your Mount of Venus.
00:21:41.801,00:21:46.597,"In a man, it means he likes the lasses, but it is a bit different for a woman."
00:21:46.639,00:21:51.685,"To be polite about it, your husband is not likely to stray far from your bed."
00:21:57.399,00:22:03.405,"The lifeline's interrupted, all bits and pieces."
00:22:05.616,00:22:09.245,"The marriage-line's divided, means two marriages."
00:22:10.412,00:22:11.413,But...
00:22:13.207,00:22:15.417,Most divided lines are broken.
00:22:18.712,00:22:20.422,Yours is...
00:22:22.424,00:22:23.425,Forked.
00:22:27.638,00:22:31.433,But I suspect your ancestor had a patron.
00:22:31.433,00:22:35.688,A prominent and powerful man who could protect him from the censure of his superiors.
00:22:35.729,00:22:40.985,"FRANK: Possibly, but it would have to have been someone very high up in the hierarchy of the day to exert that kind of influence."
00:22:42.111,00:22:43.445,The Duke of Sandringham.
00:22:44.446,00:22:46.199,The Duke of Sandringham!
00:22:46.240,00:22:47.449,But hold on.
00:22:47.449,00:22:50.119,Wasn't Sandringham a suspected Jacobite himself?
00:22:50.161,00:22:52.454,"Aye. You know, I believe you're right."
00:22:52.454,00:22:56.458,And the duke died under very suspicious circumstances just before the battle of...
00:22:56.458,00:22:57.793,"None of that, none of that!"
00:22:57.835,00:22:59.461,Stand away before you do some permanent damage.
00:22:59.461,00:23:00.921,I think we're getting somewhere at last.
00:23:00.963,00:23:05.467,"I'm really glad to hear it, but I think I shall take my leave."
00:23:05.467,00:23:07.178,"Oh, so soon?"
00:23:07.220,00:23:09.847,I feel a bath is in order.
00:23:09.889,00:23:11.849,"Aye, of course."
00:23:11.891,00:23:13.976,"Well, I'll hope you will join us for Samhain tomorrow night?"
00:23:14.018,00:23:15.686,What? The pagan festival?
00:23:15.728,00:23:17.730,"Reverend Wakefield, you do astonish me."
00:23:19.065,00:23:22.109,I love a good ghost story as much as the next fellow.
00:23:22.151,00:23:24.987,All right.
00:23:25.029,00:23:28.532,Do try to get home before the storm breaks.
00:23:37.208,00:23:43.505,CLAIRE: I'd never put any stock in superstition and my Catholicism was nominal at best.
00:23:43.505,00:23:48.510,"However, I couldn't shake the feeling that Mrs. Graham's words had a ring of prophecy."
00:23:50.346,00:23:56.352,The war had taught me to cherish the present because tomorrow might not ever come to pass.
00:23:56.394,00:24:02.983,But what I didn't know at the time was that tomorrow would prove less important than yesterday.
00:24:09.407,00:24:12.534,Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ!
00:24:50.572,00:24:54.160,"Excuse me, can I help you with something?"
00:25:19.059,00:25:23.605,"Frank, I was hoping to have the whole place lit up by the time you got back."
00:25:25.232,00:25:27.609,"Darling, what's the matter?"
00:25:30.821,00:25:32.614,Frank?
00:25:32.614,00:25:33.615,Hmm?
00:25:34.992,00:25:36.618,You look like you've seen a ghost.
00:25:40.664,00:25:43.334,I'm not at all sure that I haven't.
00:25:44.626,00:25:52.759,"When he pushed past me, he was close enough that I should have felt him brush my sleeve as he passed, but I...didn't."
00:25:52.801,00:25:56.305,And then I turned around to say something and he had gone.
00:25:56.347,00:25:58.349,He just vanished.
00:25:58.391,00:26:01.643,That's when I felt a chill down my spine.
00:26:01.894,00:26:02.895,Hmm.
00:26:07.233,00:26:11.653,Did you have many Scots in your charge during the war?
00:26:11.653,00:26:15.657,"Yes, there was quite a few."
00:26:15.657,00:26:18.536,There was one in particular.
00:26:18.660,00:26:20.787,He was a piper in the Third Seaforths.
00:26:20.829,00:26:23.790,He couldn't stand being stuck with a needle.
00:26:23.832,00:26:24.833,It was...
00:26:27.294,00:26:28.670,All right.
00:26:36.678,00:26:40.933,"What is it exactly, that, uh, you're asking me, Frank?"
00:26:42.684,00:26:49.525,"When I saw that chap staring up at you, I thought he might be someone you had nursed."
00:26:49.567,00:26:53.695,Someone who might be looking for you now to reconnect.
00:26:58.451,00:27:00.286,To Reconnect?
00:27:01.203,00:27:03.747,It wouldn't be unusual.
00:27:03.789,00:27:06.708,"I mean, it wouldn't be surprising if you had a source of..."
00:27:06.708,00:27:08.127,"Comfort, or..."
00:27:09.795,00:27:14.049,Are you asking me if I've been unfaithful?
00:27:14.091,00:27:15.509,Claire.
00:27:15.551,00:27:17.136,"Is that what you think of me, Frank?"
00:27:17.761,00:27:19.221,"No, darling. No."
00:27:19.263,00:27:25.894,"No. All I meant was that even if you had, it will make no difference to me."
00:27:25.936,00:27:28.730,And nothing you could ever do could stop my loving you.
00:27:35.529,00:27:36.738,Forgive me.
00:27:39.032,00:27:40.284,Forgive me?
00:27:43.912,00:27:45.205,Of course.
00:28:14.485,00:28:17.029,CLAIRE: Sex was our bridge back to one another.
00:28:17.070,00:28:20.366,The one place where we always met.
00:28:20.407,00:28:28.790,"Whatever obstacles presented themselves during the day or night, we could seek out and find each other again in bed."
00:28:28.790,00:28:33.086,"As long as we had that, I had faith everything would work out."
00:28:54.608,00:28:57.695,That reminds me I want to set an alarm.
00:28:58.278,00:29:00.197,No.
00:29:00.239,00:29:02.824,I thought we weren't setting alarms on this trip.
00:29:06.495,00:29:08.288,I want to see the witches.
00:29:08.330,00:29:10.832,Must I ask?
00:29:10.832,00:29:19.841,"Apparently, there's a circle of standing stones on a hill just outside the village, and there's a local group who still observe rituals there."
00:29:19.841,00:29:21.843,"Well, they're not actually witches."
00:29:21.885,00:29:23.845,This lot are meant to be druids.
00:29:23.845,00:29:26.848,"Sadly, I don't think there'll be a coven of devil-worshippers."
00:29:26.848,00:29:28.850,What a pity.
00:29:28.850,00:29:31.853,Can't imagine anything I'd rather do.
00:29:31.853,00:29:33.606,Liar.
00:29:33.647,00:29:36.275,Where will we be watching this spectacle?
00:29:36.316,00:29:37.901,A place called Craigh na Dun.
00:29:37.943,00:29:39.361,Mmm-hmm.
00:29:49.162,00:29:56.128,"FRANK: So, according to local folklore, these stones were carried here from Africa by a race of Celtic giants."
00:29:56.169,00:30:00.132,I wasn't aware that Celts made a lot of trips to Africa.
00:30:00.173,00:30:01.883,Only the giant ones.
00:30:04.720,00:30:07.806,Is that Inverness?
00:30:11.143,00:30:12.436,Someone's coming.
00:30:50.140,00:30:51.558,Is that Mrs. Graham?
00:30:52.934,00:30:54.561,I think it is.
00:30:54.603,00:30:56.062,The Reverend's housekeeper is a witch.
00:30:57.189,00:30:59.399,Not a witch.
00:31:21.963,00:31:26.301,"CLAIRE: They should have been ridiculous, and perhaps they were."
00:31:26.343,00:31:29.429,Parading in circles on top of a hill.
00:31:29.471,00:31:40.273,"But the hairs on the back of my neck prickled at the sight, and some small voice inside warned me I wasn't supposed to be here."
00:31:40.315,00:31:45.153,I was an unwelcome voyeur to something ancient and powerful.
00:34:16.930,00:34:18.139,WOMAN: Wait for me!
00:34:18.139,00:34:20.141,I've forgotten something.
00:34:21.768,00:34:23.770,"Claire, someone's coming."
00:34:43.665,00:34:45.166,Can you see her?
00:35:15.405,00:35:17.074,What have you got there?
00:35:17.198,00:35:19.034,"Um, I'm looking for that plant."
00:35:19.076,00:35:21.244,"I think it's a forget-me-not, but I'm not sure."
00:35:21.286,00:35:23.038,Why don't you pop back and get it?
00:35:23.080,00:35:25.206,I was considering it.
00:35:25.206,00:35:27.208,Would you care to go with me?
00:35:27.208,00:35:31.004,"Darling, I'd love to, but I've got an appointment with the Reverend."
00:35:31.046,00:35:32.881,He found a box of materials last night.
00:35:32.923,00:35:36.009,Bills of sale from Black Jack's quartermaster.
00:35:36.051,00:35:38.219,That sounds terribly exciting.
00:35:38.219,00:35:39.805,Are you laughing at me?
00:35:39.846,00:35:41.056,Never.
00:35:42.432,00:35:45.560,Shall I meet you for dinner later?
00:35:45.602,00:35:47.228,Love you.
00:35:48.855,00:35:50.231,Come here.
00:37:44.345,00:37:54.981,"CLAIRE: Once, traveling at night, I fell asleep in the passenger seat of a moving car, lulled by the noise and motion into an illusion of serene weightlessness."
00:37:56.441,00:37:59.569,Then the driver took a bridge too fast.
00:37:59.611,00:38:08.703,"And I woke to see the world spinning outside the car windows, and the sickening sensation of falling at high speed."
00:38:08.745,00:38:16.377,"That is as close as I can come to describing what I experienced, but it falls woefully short."
00:39:03.758,00:39:05.093,What?
00:40:14.704,00:40:18.958,"CLAIRE: When confronted with the impossible, the rational mind will grope for the logical."
00:40:24.214,00:40:29.094,CLAIRE: Perhaps I had stumbled onto the set of a cinema company filming a costume drama of some sort.
00:40:47.279,00:40:51.366,CLAIRE: But there was no logical reason for actors to fire live ammunition.
00:41:45.586,00:41:47.588,Frank?
00:41:47.588,00:41:49.715,What the devil are you doing?
00:41:57.056,00:41:58.141,You're not Frank.
00:41:58.724,00:42:00.268,"No, madam. I am not."
00:42:02.270,00:42:03.604,Who the bloody hell are you?
00:42:09.610,00:42:14.032,"I am Jonathan Randall Esquire, Captain of His Majesty's Eighth Dragoons."
00:42:16.993,00:42:18.619,At your service.
00:42:28.880,00:42:30.631,Who are you?
00:42:30.631,00:42:31.841,My husband is expecting me.
00:42:31.883,00:42:34.635,He'll come looking for me if I'm not back in 10 minutes.
00:42:34.635,00:42:37.138,Your husband?
00:42:38.515,00:42:40.308,What is his name?
00:42:41.184,00:42:43.644,Frank.
00:42:46.189,00:42:49.526,Frank Beauchamp.
00:42:49.650,00:42:53.988,"Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Frank Beauchamp, a teacher's wife."
00:42:54.030,00:42:55.865,You must think me the fool.
00:42:55.907,00:42:59.952,You would be well advised to tell me exactly who you are and why you're here.
00:42:59.994,00:43:02.997,"Madam, you'll find my patience is not infinite."
00:43:03.039,00:43:04.665,"Get off me, you bastard."
00:43:07.919,00:43:12.340,"Ah! The speech of a lady, and the language of a whore."
00:43:12.382,00:43:13.674,I choose the whore.
00:43:20.806,00:43:22.683,What?
00:43:24.018,00:43:25.437,Who are you?
00:43:25.478,00:43:27.313,Where are we going?
00:43:28.523,00:43:30.900,MAN: Over here!
00:43:30.942,00:43:33.027,You men over there!
00:43:38.199,00:43:41.869,"CLAIRE: I wanted it to be a dream, but I knew it wasn't."
00:43:47.708,00:43:55.925,"If nothing else, my erstwhile savior fairly wreaked of odors too foul to be part of any dream I was likely to conjure up."
00:44:24.787,00:44:26.747,"Let's have a look at you then, lass."
00:44:30.042,00:44:31.752,I trust you're able to see me now?
00:44:31.752,00:44:33.379,What's your name?
00:44:33.421,00:44:36.591,CLAIRE: I decided to continue using my maiden name.
00:44:36.633,00:44:40.011,"If they intended to ransom me, I didn't want to lead them back to Frank."
00:44:40.595,00:44:41.846,Claire.
00:44:41.887,00:44:43.764,Claire Beauchamp.
00:44:43.764,00:44:46.184,Claire Beauchamp.
00:44:46.225,00:44:47.977,That's right.
00:44:48.019,00:44:49.354,You said you found her?
00:44:49.395,00:44:50.771,Aye.
00:44:50.771,00:44:55.151,She was havin' words with a certain Captain of dragoons with whom we are acquainted.
00:44:55.193,00:44:58.779,There seemed to be some question as to whether the lady was or was not a whore.
00:44:58.779,00:45:01.240,And what was the lady's position in this discussion?
00:45:03.326,00:45:04.785,I am not.
00:45:04.785,00:45:06.787,We could put her to the test.
00:45:06.787,00:45:08.414,I don't hold with rape.
00:45:10.208,00:45:12.793,"And we don't have time for it, anyway."
00:45:12.793,00:45:18.383,"MURTAGH: Dougal, I've no idea what she might be or who, but I'll stake my best shirt she's no a whore."
00:45:21.260,00:45:23.054,We'll puzzle it out later.
00:45:23.095,00:45:27.559,DOUGAL: We've got a good distance to go tonight and we must do something about Jamie first.
00:45:27.600,00:45:31.979,"CLAIRE: Escape was my chief concern, but I had no idea where I was."
00:45:32.021,00:45:37.402,And trying to find the road back to Inverness in the gathering darkness felt like a fool's errand.
00:45:37.443,00:45:39.111,"Out o' joint, poor bugger."
00:45:39.153,00:45:41.822,"You can't ride with it like that, can you, lad?"
00:45:41.822,00:45:43.366,Hurts bad enough sitting still.
00:45:43.408,00:45:44.992,I couldna manage a horse.
00:45:45.034,00:45:46.536,I don't mean to be leaving him behind.
00:45:46.578,00:45:48.538,"There's no help for it, then."
00:45:48.580,00:45:50.873,I'll have to force the joint back.
00:45:50.915,00:45:59.591,"CLAIRE: The wisest course of action would have been to keep my head down, my mouth shut, and wait for the search parties Frank must have called out by now."
00:45:59.632,00:46:00.966,"Here, lad."
00:46:11.852,00:46:12.978,ANGUS: Hold him.
00:46:16.399,00:46:17.858,Don't you dare!
00:46:18.859,00:46:19.902,Stand aside at once.
00:46:21.112,00:46:22.947,You'll break his arm if you do it like that.
00:46:25.157,00:46:29.537,You have to get the bone of the upper arm in the correct position before it slips back into joint.
00:46:43.968,00:46:45.177,Hold him steady.
00:46:58.650,00:46:59.900,This is the worst part.
00:47:16.668,00:47:18.294,It doesn't hurt anymore!
00:47:18.336,00:47:19.671,It will.
00:47:19.712,00:47:21.547,It will be tender for a week.
00:47:21.589,00:47:23.924,You'll need a sling.
00:47:23.924,00:47:27.303,"You, fetch me a long piece of cloth or a belt."
00:47:27.345,00:47:30.598,Fetch me she says?
00:47:30.640,00:47:31.932,Give her yer belt.
00:47:37.146,00:47:39.649,I'm taking a guess you've done this before.
00:47:41.192,00:47:42.652,Not a wet nurse.
00:47:46.947,00:47:49.659,You mustn't move the joint for two or three days.
00:47:49.701,00:47:52.953,"When you begin to use it again, go very slowly at first."
00:47:53.954,00:47:58.626,"Stop at once if it hurts, and use warm compresses on it daily."
00:48:00.127,00:48:03.422,"All right, how does that feel?"
00:48:04.965,00:48:06.967,Better. Thank ye.
00:48:08.678,00:48:09.679,Can you ride?
00:48:10.722,00:48:12.682,Aye.
00:48:36.831,00:48:39.458,Where is it?
00:48:39.500,00:48:41.001,It should be visible from here.
00:48:42.044,00:48:43.504,JAMIE: Inverness?
00:48:44.589,00:48:46.298,You're looking straight at it.
00:48:49.510,00:48:53.222,CLAIRE: There were no electric lights as far as the eye could see.
00:48:53.264,00:49:01.021,"So, as much as my rational mind rebelled against the idea, I knew in my heart I was no longer in the 20th century."
00:49:05.025,00:49:07.152,DOUGAL: Get yourself up.
00:49:07.194,00:49:09.447,You be sure to stay close to the rest of us.
00:49:09.488,00:49:12.658,"And should ye try anythin' else, I shall slit your throat for you."
00:49:12.700,00:49:14.034,Do you understand me?
00:49:15.035,00:49:16.203,Gimme your foot.
00:49:16.245,00:49:17.246,Give it to me.
00:49:27.047,00:49:28.090,Careful!
00:49:28.132,00:49:30.050,What are you trying to do?
00:49:30.050,00:49:32.052,Get my plaid loose to cover you.
00:49:32.052,00:49:33.429,You're shivering.
00:49:37.683,00:49:39.936,"Thank you, but I'm fine, really."
00:49:40.060,00:49:43.063,"You're shaking so hard, it's making my teeth rattle."
00:49:43.063,00:49:47.234,"The plaid will keep us both warm, but I canna do it one-handed."
00:49:47.276,00:49:48.903,Can ye reach?
00:50:00.080,00:50:01.457,We don't want you to freeze before sun-up.
00:50:03.459,00:50:05.001,Sun-up?
00:50:05.043,00:50:07.171,You mean we'll be riding all night?
00:50:07.212,00:50:10.424,"All night, and the next one, too, I reckon."
00:50:11.926,00:50:14.887,"Fine time of year for a ride, though."
00:51:29.169,00:51:30.170,You see up there?
00:51:32.256,00:51:35.175,I know this place.
00:51:35.175,00:51:37.261,Been through here before have ye?
00:51:37.720,00:51:39.055,Yes.
00:51:39.179,00:51:43.225,"...the 17th and 18th centuries, you'd have often found a British army patrol up there."
00:51:44.184,00:51:45.728,I recognize that rock.
00:51:45.770,00:51:48.188,The one that looks like a cock's tail?
00:51:48.230,00:51:50.190,It has a name.
00:51:52.651,00:51:55.446,The Cocknammon Rock.
00:51:55.487,00:51:58.365,"The English, they use it for ambushes!"
00:51:58.407,00:52:01.201,They could be lying in wait right now.
00:52:01.201,00:52:03.454,It's a bonnie place for an ambush right enough.
00:52:06.206,00:52:07.249,Dougal.
00:52:10.210,00:52:11.921,Dougal. Dougal.
00:52:29.229,00:52:34.735,"Now, you'll be telling me exactly how and why you come to know there's an ambush up ahead."
00:52:34.777,00:52:38.238,"I don't know, but I've heard the redcoats use Cocknammon..."
00:52:38.238,00:52:39.239,Where did you hear?
00:52:42.242,00:52:43.243,In the village.
00:54:06.493,00:54:07.745,Lost yer way?
00:54:15.002,00:54:16.837,Hope you haven't been misusing that shoulder.
00:54:18.338,00:54:19.339,You're hurt!
00:54:20.216,00:54:22.593,This lot isn't my blood.
00:54:22.634,00:54:24.220,Not much of it anyway.
00:54:28.348,00:54:32.061,Dougal and the others will be waiting further up the stream.
00:54:33.353,00:54:34.396,We should go.
00:54:36.356,00:54:39.026,I'm not going with you!
00:54:39.068,00:54:41.904,What? Are you going to cut my throat if I don't?
00:54:41.946,00:54:43.405,"Why, no?"
00:54:44.364,00:54:45.365,But...
00:54:45.365,00:54:47.367,You don't look that heavy.
00:54:48.535,00:54:53.999,"Now if ye won't walk, I shall pick you up and throw you over my shoulder."
00:54:56.127,00:54:57.377,Do ye want me to do that?
00:54:58.796,00:54:59.838,No!
00:55:01.840,00:55:06.720,"Well, then, I suppose that means you're coming with me."
00:55:20.400,00:55:22.027,Serves you right.
00:55:22.069,00:55:24.404,Probably torn muscles as well as bruising.
00:55:24.404,00:55:27.032,"Well, it wasn't much of a choice."
00:55:28.033,00:55:32.163,"If I'd not moved my shoulder, I'd never have moved anything else ever again."
00:55:32.204,00:55:36.292,I can handle a single redcoat with one hand maybe even two.
00:55:36.416,00:55:38.502,But not three.
00:55:38.543,00:55:41.672,"Besides, ye can fix it for me again when we get to where we're going."
00:55:41.713,00:55:43.423,That's what you think.
00:55:43.423,00:55:45.884,It was hard.
00:55:45.926,00:55:50.222,For tipping us to the villains in the rocks and giving us a bit o' fun!
00:55:58.939,00:56:01.108,Have a wee nip.
00:56:01.150,00:56:04.278,"It willna fill your belly, but it will make ye forget you're hungry."
00:56:48.488,00:56:49.489,Stop!
00:56:50.490,00:56:52.492,Help! He's going over!
00:56:57.289,00:56:58.582,Help me get him up!
00:56:59.499,00:57:00.834,Come on.
00:57:02.086,00:57:03.087,Take it easy.
00:57:03.879,00:57:04.880,Easy now.
00:57:11.803,00:57:13.055,Gunshot wound.
00:57:13.097,00:57:14.598,The idiot could've said something.
00:57:14.639,00:57:16.308,It's a clean exit.
00:57:16.350,00:57:18.518,I think the round's gone straight through the muscle.
00:57:18.518,00:57:21.272,"I don't think it's serious, but he's lost a lot of blood."
00:57:21.313,00:57:24.524,It'll need to be disinfected before I can dress it properly.
00:57:24.566,00:57:26.651,Disinfect?
00:57:26.693,00:57:30.239,"Yes, it must be cleaned of dirt to protect it from germs."
00:57:30.281,00:57:31.323,Germs?
00:57:32.657,00:57:34.410,Just get me some iodine.
00:57:37.246,00:57:38.247,Merthiolate?
00:57:40.582,00:57:42.542,Alcohol?
00:57:44.628,00:57:45.629,ANGUS: Here you go.
00:57:52.552,00:57:54.430,Welcome back.
00:57:54.554,00:57:56.223,"I'm all right, just a wee bit dizzy."
00:57:56.265,00:57:57.766,You are not all right.
00:57:57.808,00:57:59.851,Didn't you tell how badly you were bleeding?
00:57:59.893,00:58:04.564,"You're lucky you're not dead, brawling and fighting and throwing yourself off horses."
00:58:04.564,00:58:07.776,"All right, I need a sterile bandage and some clean cloth."
00:58:13.073,00:58:14.699,Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ.
00:58:23.667,00:58:25.043,Hold still.
00:58:27.838,00:58:29.340,Easy.
00:58:32.009,00:58:33.302,Lift him up.
00:58:38.849,00:58:41.893,Come on you God damn bloody bastard.
00:58:41.935,00:58:44.604,I've never heard a woman use such language in my life.
00:58:44.646,00:58:47.024,"Your husband should tan ye hide, woman."
00:58:47.065,00:58:49.026,"St. Paul says, Let a woman be silent, and..."
00:58:49.067,00:58:51.862,You can mind your own bloody business and so can St. Paul!
00:58:57.826,00:59:03.165,"And if you move so much as a single muscle while I'm tying this bandage, I'll bloody throttle you."
00:59:03.207,00:59:05.834,"Uh, threats is it?"
00:59:05.876,00:59:07.627,And after I shared my drink with ye.
00:59:07.627,00:59:09.629,We have 15 miles to go yet.
00:59:09.629,00:59:12.007,"Five hours, at the least, if not seven."
00:59:12.049,00:59:14.634,We'll stay long enough for ye to stem the bleeding and dress the wound.
00:59:14.634,00:59:16.094,No more than that.
00:59:18.389,00:59:19.890,He needs rest.
00:59:21.641,00:59:22.642,Did you hear me?
00:59:22.642,00:59:24.019,Randall...
00:59:27.647,00:59:34.863,The officer ye encountered he won't give up so easily.
00:59:34.905,00:59:41.537,He commands the redcoats hereabouts and he'll have patrols out in every direction by now.
00:59:42.996,00:59:45.165,We canna stay here long.
00:59:45.207,00:59:47.125,You know Randall.
00:59:47.167,00:59:48.752,"Black Jack Randall, that is?"
00:59:51.338,00:59:52.339,Aye.
00:59:55.175,00:59:59.137,I won't risk you or anyone else being taken prisoner by that man.
01:00:00.680,01:00:09.606,"If ye canna fix me up well enough to ride, then you'll all be leaving me here with a loaded pistol so I may determine my own fate."
01:00:12.234,01:00:16.863,You might've well told me you were shot before you fell off the horse.
01:00:16.905,01:00:18.449,Dinna hurt much at the time.
01:00:19.866,01:00:21.118,Does it hurt now?
01:00:22.702,01:00:23.620,Aye.
01:00:24.704,01:00:26.664,Good.
01:00:26.706,01:00:28.750,That's about all I can do.
01:00:28.792,01:00:30.668,The rest is up to you.
01:00:46.935,01:00:47.978,"Thank you, Sassenach."
01:00:49.354,01:00:50.647,Truly.
01:00:53.775,01:00:55.652,"All right, on your horse, soldier."
01:01:30.770,01:01:32.314,CLAIRE: Castle Leoch.
01:01:34.650,01:01:37.110,I'd been here with Frank two days ago.
01:01:38.778,01:01:40.447,Or was that in the future?
01:01:42.782,01:01:45.785,How could I remember something that hadn't happened yet?
01:01:50.541,01:01:56.213,"So far, I'd been assaulted, threatened, kidnapped and nearly raped."
01:01:56.254,01:02:00.676,"And somehow, I knew that my journey had only just begun."
00:00:01.376,00:00:02.920,CLAIRE: Previously...
00:00:02.962,00:00:05.130,We were in Scotland on our second honeymoon.
00:00:05.172,00:00:06.966,MRS. GRAHAM: This is a pattern I've not seen before.
00:00:07.007,00:00:08.968,The marriage line's divided.
00:00:09.009,00:00:11.052,The life line's forked.
00:00:11.094,00:00:13.848,Where will we be watching the spectacle?
00:00:13.889,00:00:15.808,FRANK: There is a place called Craigh Na Dun.
00:00:15.850,00:00:18.393,There is a local group who used to observe rituals there.
00:00:26.652,00:00:28.278,You're not Frank.
00:00:31.406,00:00:33.283,What's your name?
00:00:33.325,00:00:34.409,CLAIRE: I'm a nurse.
00:00:36.453,00:00:38.956,"Thank you, Sassenach."
00:00:38.998,00:00:45.629,"WOMAN: As much as my rational mind rebelled against the idea, I knew in my heart I was no longer in the 20th century."
00:02:49.920,00:02:54.173,"CLAIRE: The last time I was here, Frank and I simply took the car."
00:02:54.215,00:03:03.809,"But after spending two days and nights jolting along on a horse, I knew I'd never find my way back, not unless I convinced these people to help me in some way."
00:03:03.851,00:03:05.936,"MAN: Dougal, you're back early, man."
00:03:05.978,00:03:07.688,We hadna thought to see ye before the gathering.
00:03:07.729,00:03:10.858,"Aye, well, we've had some luck, some good, some bad."
00:03:12.109,00:03:16.279,"Rupert, ye great fat fart, what have you done to my peggy now?"
00:03:16.321,00:03:17.781,Did I not tell you to tighten her girth?
00:03:17.823,00:03:19.950,"Let me be, old rat."
00:03:19.992,00:03:22.870,"I been riding all night, and I don't need you squalling in my ear."
00:03:22.911,00:03:25.164,Did ye never even look at her hooves?
00:03:25.204,00:03:30.794,"You canna expect any beast to carry around something that weighs as much as you, without taking care of the poor creature's feet."
00:03:30.836,00:03:33.212,Like a cow riding a mouse.
00:03:33.254,00:03:34.213,Shut yer hole.
00:03:43.765,00:03:45.642,"Rupert, m'dear!"
00:03:45.684,00:03:47.227,How good to see ye!
00:03:47.936,00:03:49.563,"Oh, my dear."
00:03:52.066,00:03:53.942,Mwah!
00:03:53.984,00:03:56.236,"Ye'll all be needing breakfast, I reckon."
00:03:56.862,00:03:58.864,Plenty in the kitchen.
00:03:58.906,00:04:00.741,"Away in, and feed yerselves."
00:04:05.370,00:04:11.001,"Murtagh, you look and smell like a rat that's been dragged through sheep dung."
00:04:11.835,00:04:13.837,"Gi' us a kiss, then."
00:04:13.879,00:04:15.047,"Oh, no!"
00:04:23.138,00:04:25.682,And what do we have here?
00:04:32.689,00:04:34.983,"Claire Beauchamp, mistress Fitzgibbons."
00:04:39.071,00:04:44.367,"Murtagh found her, and Dougal said we must bring her along with us, so..."
00:04:45.244,00:04:46.286,So.
00:04:48.413,00:04:49.456,Well...
00:04:52.459,00:04:53.293,Claire.
00:04:58.715,00:04:59.925,Come with me.
00:04:59.967,00:05:03.303,"We shall find you something to eat, something to wear that's a bit more..."
00:05:05.180,00:05:06.974,"Well, a bit more."
00:05:08.267,00:05:10.018,"Well, what about him?"
00:05:10.060,00:05:12.271,I can fend for myself.
00:05:12.312,00:05:14.522,"No, you're hurt."
00:05:15.899,00:05:17.609,I'll be fine.
00:05:19.861,00:05:23.490,"I bandaged his shoulder, but I wasn't able to clean it or dress it properly."
00:05:23.531,00:05:25.325,I must tend to it before it gets infected.
00:05:27.869,00:05:29.412,"I mean, inflamed."
00:05:30.872,00:05:32.373,"You know, with, with fever and swelling."
00:05:34.001,00:05:35.294,"Oh, aye."
00:05:36.295,00:05:37.754,I ken fine what ye mean.
00:05:40.715,00:05:42.717,But do you mean to say you know what to do for that?
00:05:45.971,00:05:47.346,"Are ye a charmer, then?"
00:05:49.057,00:05:50.309,A beaton?
00:05:52.269,00:05:53.352,Something like that.
00:05:55.647,00:05:56.564,Jamie.
00:05:57.565,00:05:58.859,Ye heard the lady.
00:05:58.900,00:06:00.235,Ye need tending.
00:06:00.694,00:06:01.486,This way.
00:06:05.615,00:06:06.950,Let's get you out of the rain.
00:06:26.136,00:06:29.556,"MRS. FITZ: As you asked, garlic and witch hazel to boil the rags."
00:06:29.597,00:06:32.100,I also brought you comfrey and cherry bark for the pain.
00:06:32.726,00:06:33.518,CLAIRE: Perfect.
00:06:36.355,00:06:38.397,Call out if you need anything else.
00:06:41.860,00:06:43.111,"I will. Thank you, Ms. Fitzgibbons."
00:06:44.612,00:06:46.281,Everybody calls me Mrs. Fitz.
00:06:47.824,00:06:49.284,You may also.
00:07:17.854,00:07:19.064,The redcoats.
00:07:21.733,00:07:23.526,Flogged me twice in the space of a week.
00:07:25.320,00:07:29.074,"They'd have done it twice the same day, I expect, were they not afraid of killing me."
00:07:30.200,00:07:32.202,There's no joy in flogging a dead man.
00:07:34.537,00:07:36.206,I shouldn't think anyone would do such a thing for joy.
00:07:38.625,00:07:42.796,"if Randall was not precisely joyous, he was at least very pleased with himself."
00:07:44.172,00:07:46.383,Clumsy.
00:07:54.474,00:07:55.475,Why were you flogged?
00:07:58.145,00:08:01.522,"Hmm, well, the first time was escaping Fort William."
00:08:02.983,00:08:05.485,And the second was theft.
00:08:05.526,00:08:06.861,"Or at least, that's what the charge sheet read."
00:08:08.863,00:08:10.490,Why were you escaping in the first place?
00:08:12.951,00:08:14.119,holding me prisoner.
00:08:15.078,00:08:16.330,I gathered that.
00:08:18.957,00:08:20.959,Why?
00:08:23.420,00:08:25.839,"Oh, that."
00:08:25.880,00:08:26.840,Obstruction.
00:08:28.508,00:08:30.469,Obstruction?
00:08:30.510,00:08:32.053,It doesn't sound like a serious crime.
00:08:32.095,00:08:37.725,"Ah, well, I suppose it's whatever the English say it is."
00:08:41.896,00:08:45.484,"Aye, it was near to four years ago now."
00:08:48.987,00:08:58.621,"They put a levy on all the land-holders in the county, sent out small parties of soldiers collecting food, horses for transport, and suchlike."
00:09:01.541,00:09:05.545,"Aye, it was one day in October, Captain Randall came along to our place."
00:09:08.798,00:09:10.633,My father was away.
00:09:10.675,00:09:11.843,He'd gone to a funeral.
00:09:14.429,00:09:16.515,I was up in the fields when I heard shouting.
00:09:17.640,00:09:18.641,GIRL: No!
00:09:19.600,00:09:20.685,"No, no!"
00:09:25.357,00:09:26.566,JAMIE: Jenny!
00:09:28.151,00:09:29.277,"Jenny, run!"
00:09:38.912,00:09:39.913,RANDALL: Consider yourself carefully.
00:09:53.801,00:09:54.886,"I surrender to you, sir."
00:09:58.306,00:10:00.934,"Now, now let my sister be."
00:10:01.642,00:10:02.643,Your sister?
00:10:04.438,00:10:05.688,That's interesting.
00:10:16.575,00:10:17.617,Shh.
00:10:18.618,00:10:20.620,"She's, uh, she's bonny."
00:10:23.373,00:10:24.499,I'll take a closer look.
00:10:27.294,00:10:28.545,No!
00:10:28.587,00:10:30.130,No!
00:10:31.923,00:10:33.133,No!
00:10:36.344,00:10:37.512,Bring his head up.
00:10:45.520,00:10:46.771,He wanted to send a message.
00:10:49.274,00:10:51.734,This is what you get when you fight back against the English.
00:11:22.890,00:11:23.724,Mmm.
00:11:25.935,00:11:26.811,Ah.
00:11:28.313,00:11:30.398,You care to see more?
00:11:30.440,00:11:32.733,Or would you rather go into the house and offer me better entertainment?
00:11:32.775,00:11:33.692,JAMIE: Don't go with him.
00:11:35.487,00:11:37.405,Even if he slits my throat right before your eyes.
00:11:51.545,00:11:52.671,So...
00:11:55.006,00:11:56.090,She went with him.
00:11:59.718,00:12:03.722,"She thought he'd kill me, and, ah..."
00:12:05.308,00:12:06.934,"After that, I dinna ken what happened."
00:12:08.436,00:12:13.191,"When I woke up, I was trussed up in the wagon with the chickens, jolting down the road to Fort William."
00:12:14.150,00:12:15.694,I'm so sorry.
00:12:15.734,00:12:17.362,That must have been terrible for you.
00:12:17.778,00:12:19.656,"Oh, aye."
00:12:19.698,00:12:21.533,Chickens are very poor company.
00:12:25.912,00:12:27.830,Mmm.
00:12:27.872,00:12:29.748,I'm going to strap that arm to your side.
00:12:32.751,00:12:33.836,Just hold still.
00:12:41.469,00:12:42.803,Hmm.
00:12:42.845,00:12:46.516,You're a kind woman with a good touch.
00:12:52.522,00:12:53.772,Your husband is a lucky man.
00:13:03.575,00:13:04.783,CLAIRE: My husband.
00:13:06.160,00:13:07.870,What was Frank going through?
00:13:09.872,00:13:14.835,"His wife disappears without a trace, without a word, without explanation."
00:13:16.463,00:13:18.881,Fears would prey on him.
00:13:18.923,00:13:22.218,Perhaps I was abducted.
00:13:22.260,00:13:24.429,Claire?
00:13:22.260,00:13:26.765,"Perhaps, worst of all, I had left him for another man."
00:13:26.805,00:13:28.141,Mrs. Randall?
00:13:29.100,00:13:30.017,Claire!
00:13:35.231,00:13:36.316,Mistress.
00:13:38.401,00:13:39.818,"Mrs. Beauchamp, what's wrong?"
00:13:43.197,00:13:44.449,I'm fine.
00:13:47.535,00:13:49.162,I was just thinking about my husband.
00:13:51.498,00:13:52.582,Oh.
00:13:54.833,00:13:55.834,Lass...
00:13:58.087,00:13:59.297,Is he not alive?
00:14:04.344,00:14:05.804,"No, actually."
00:14:08.306,00:14:09.848,He's not alive.
00:14:14.479,00:14:15.563,Shh.
00:14:16.397,00:14:17.482,Shh.
00:14:20.276,00:14:22.570,"There, shh."
00:14:22.612,00:14:24.864,"No, shh."
00:14:42.173,00:14:43.883,I'm sorry.
00:14:51.891,00:14:53.727,You need not be scared of me.
00:14:54.853,00:14:59.649,"Nor anyone else here, so long as I'm with ye."
00:15:01.651,00:15:03.194,When you're not with me?
00:15:06.698,00:15:11.536,Just never forget that you're English in a place where that's not a pretty thing to be.
00:15:16.999,00:15:18.585,"Thank you, I will."
00:15:19.210,00:15:20.211,Watch yourself.
00:15:25.550,00:15:26.926,"Now, you sleep a bit."
00:15:27.468,00:15:28.678,You're worn out.
00:15:32.181,00:15:34.601,Likely someone will want to speak to you before too long.
00:15:37.896,00:15:39.564,I suppose you're right.
00:15:57.665,00:15:59.208,You must get up now!
00:16:00.543,00:16:01.711,Up with ye!
00:16:06.173,00:16:08.676,You slept the whole day.
00:16:14.390,00:16:16.350,I've some hot broth for ye by the fire.
00:16:21.147,00:16:22.022,Rouse yourself.
00:16:30.364,00:16:31.365,Thank you.
00:16:47.173,00:16:48.007,Come along.
00:16:55.097,00:16:57.016,What kind of corset is that?
00:16:58.852,00:17:01.020,"Um, it's a brassiere."
00:17:03.940,00:17:05.024,It's from France.
00:17:05.775,00:17:06.860,Oh.
00:17:28.589,00:17:29.966,Good and tight.
00:17:56.367,00:17:57.869,There.
00:17:57.911,00:18:00.454,Now you're ready to be taken to himself.
00:18:23.269,00:18:27.648,"CLAIRE: If I was going to survive, I needed to acclimatize myself as quickly as possible."
00:18:28.942,00:18:31.069,"I knew where I was, but when?"
00:18:32.403,00:18:36.156,"From the clothes and weapons alone, I knew it was most likely the 18th century."
00:18:42.914,00:18:45.332,1743.
00:18:45.374,00:18:48.002,Scotland is definitely part of Great Britain.
00:18:48.044,00:18:49.712,I see you've met some of my friends.
00:18:52.966,00:18:54.717,Forgive me for helping myself.
00:19:06.771,00:19:08.188,Some old comrades...
00:19:10.024,00:19:13.945,Some new acquaintances yet to make their secrets known.
00:19:15.279,00:19:17.197,But all friends nonetheless.
00:19:18.032,00:19:20.200,"I welcome ye, mistress."
00:19:20.242,00:19:25.164,"My name is Colum Ban Campbell MacKenzie, laird of this castle."
00:19:27.125,00:19:28.126,Please.
00:19:33.673,00:19:38.552,"CLAIRE: 1743, decades before the American Revolution."
00:19:38.594,00:19:41.681,England and France are at war again.
00:19:41.722,00:19:43.724,One of the Hanover kings is on the throne.
00:19:44.350,00:19:45.476,But which one?
00:19:49.856,00:19:57.113,It was my understanding that my brother and his men found you in some apparent distress.
00:19:57.571,00:19:59.949,Apparent?
00:19:59.991,00:20:04.829,I was attacked and nearly raped by one of the soldiers of King George II.
00:20:06.664,00:20:12.795,"And other than this, uh, this near rape, you suffered no further molestation?"
00:20:13.295,00:20:15.131,No.
00:20:15.173,00:20:18.384,Please extend my gratitude to your brother for his kind escort.
00:20:23.556,00:20:28.019,"I will, of course, need to arrange transport back to Inverness as soon as possible."
00:20:30.312,00:20:32.982,I'm sure something can be arranged.
00:20:33.024,00:20:43.951,"But I do myself wish to know how exactly a lady such as yourself came to be wandering about in the woods, dressed in nothing but her shift."
00:20:45.452,00:20:56.756,"It's interesting. I took a course in withstanding interrogation as part of officer training, and the basic principle was that you stick to the truth as much as humanly possible, only altering those details that have to be kept secret."
00:20:56.797,00:20:58.632,I am a widowed lady from Oxfordshire.
00:21:00.218,00:21:07.307,"I was traveling with a manservant to distant relatives in France, and we were set upon by highwaymen."
00:21:07.349,00:21:12.271,"While I managed to escape the bandits, I was forced to abandon my horse and property."
00:21:13.231,00:21:19.195,"While wandering through the woods, I was suddenly attacked by Captain Jack Randall."
00:21:19.237,00:21:20.905,I believe you know of him.
00:21:24.200,00:21:29.997,It was during this unpleasant encounter that I was relieved of my clothes.
00:21:32.458,00:21:37.337,It's true that Captain Randall has a certain reputation.
00:21:39.173,00:21:41.383,But he is an officer.
00:21:42.009,00:21:43.844,Hmm.
00:21:43.886,00:21:53.312,"And you're saying that a man bearing the king's commission decided to rape a stray lady traveler he came upon in the woods, for no good reason."
00:21:55.815,00:22:00.319,"Is there ever a good reason for rape, Master MacKenzie?"
00:22:02.696,00:22:04.323,"I beg your forgiveness, Madam."
00:22:06.700,00:22:09.328,An unfortunate turn of phrase on my part.
00:22:11.580,00:22:12.665,Not at all.
00:22:14.125,00:22:17.753,I believe we were discussing my transport back to Inverness.
00:22:19.588,00:22:20.506,Aye.
00:22:22.216,00:22:28.806,"A tinker by the name of Sean Petrie, he will be here Saturday next."
00:22:28.848,00:22:35.604,"He stops at Leoch on his way to Inverness once a month, and he often has room for one or two passengers."
00:22:38.232,00:22:40.484,Saturday next?
00:22:41.652,00:22:44.322,I've lost track in all the confusion.
00:22:44.362,00:22:46.364,"Oh, not at all."
00:22:51.745,00:22:52.955,Meanwhile...
00:22:57.501,00:23:00.378,I offer you the hospitality of our humble home.
00:23:02.715,00:23:03.507,Thank you.
00:23:09.180,00:23:11.015,CLAIRE: Five days.
00:23:11.057,00:23:18.396,"Five days, and I would be back on the road to Inverness, and then back to the stones atop Craigh Na Dun, and hopefully back home."
00:23:21.441,00:23:23.819,I did know something of this era...
00:23:23.861,00:23:27.156,"The politics, the people, their dress."
00:23:27.198,00:23:30.159,Even some of their customs and colloquialisms were familiar.
00:23:32.245,00:23:36.582,"But it was all secondhand knowledge, acquired from books, museums, paintings."
00:23:38.542,00:23:42.171,It was like landing on an alien world you'd only glimpsed through a telescope.
00:23:48.802,00:23:50.930,"DOUGAL: Aye, lads."
00:23:50.971,00:23:53.182,"Well, two against one, hey?"
00:23:53.224,00:23:54.432,How about two against two?
00:23:55.101,00:23:56.769,Where you going?
00:23:56.810,00:23:58.436,What about you?
00:23:59.063,00:24:00.106,Show us your moves.
00:24:00.147,00:24:01.648,"Oh, that's it, good lad."
00:24:01.690,00:24:03.067,"Oh, very good."
00:24:03.859,00:24:05.027,"Oh, very quick. Oh!"
00:24:05.069,00:24:07.738,"Oh, come on."
00:24:07.780,00:24:09.323,"Oh, no, no, you wouldna kill an unarmed..."
00:24:09.365,00:24:10.699,"Man! Oh, no!"
00:24:10.741,00:24:12.368,But he's not dead!
00:24:12.410,00:24:14.452,"Ah, I've got ye!"
00:24:14.703,00:24:15.955,Aah!
00:24:15.996,00:24:22.086,CLAIRE: But then you begin to wonder if maybe life on this alien world is not so different after all.
00:25:47.921,00:25:48.797,Allow me.
00:25:55.929,00:25:56.763,Thank you.
00:26:05.398,00:26:07.358,"May I present my wife, Letitia?"
00:26:07.400,00:26:12.029,"Letitia, Mrs. Claire Beauchamp, an English lady of Oxfordshire."
00:26:12.071,00:26:13.571,A pleasure to meet ye.
00:26:13.613,00:26:14.572,The pleasure's mine.
00:26:15.241,00:26:19.286,I trust Mrs. Fitzgibbons found you comfortable lodgings?
00:26:19.328,00:26:21.579,Very.
00:26:21.621,00:26:26.835,The wonder is how she manages to bake bannocks such as these with the poor ovens we have in the kitchens.
00:26:41.141,00:26:42.101,Why Beech-ham?
00:26:44.811,00:26:46.105,I beg your pardon?
00:26:46.146,00:26:49.275,I was wondering why you call yourself Claire Beech-ham.
00:26:51.068,00:26:53.362,It's my name.
00:26:53.404,00:26:59.743,"Aye, but if your family hail from France, would it not be more properly Bo-cham?"
00:27:02.955,00:27:08.626,"Well, the ties we have to France are old, but not close."
00:27:10.463,00:27:13.631,"At some point, I suspect an ancestor decided to adopt the English style."
00:27:17.010,00:27:20.264,"And what part of France do your folk come from, exactly?"
00:27:22.224,00:27:25.643,"The relatives I have are from the North, near Compiegne."
00:27:26.979,00:27:28.021,Compiegne.
00:27:33.402,00:27:35.653,I trust Mr. Mactavish is feeling better.
00:27:36.322,00:27:37.573,Mr. Mactavish?
00:27:37.615,00:27:38.782,She means young Jamie.
00:27:39.450,00:27:41.410,LETITIA: Jamie? Why?
00:27:41.452,00:27:42.869,Whatever is the matter with the lad?
00:27:42.911,00:27:44.371,"Naught but a scratch, my dear."
00:27:45.956,00:27:47.207,"Where is he, though, Dougal?"
00:27:47.249,00:27:49.667,I sent him to the stables to help Old Alec with the horses.
00:27:50.752,00:27:52.171,The stables?
00:27:52.212,00:27:54.548,Best place for him under the circumstances.
00:27:54.590,00:27:56.091,Dinna want him inside the walls.
00:28:00.429,00:28:05.518,"But it's yours to choose, if you don't agree with my orders."
00:28:09.021,00:28:11.565,I reckon he'll do well enough there.
00:28:11.607,00:28:13.108,Bring us a bottle of the rhenish.
00:28:18.947,00:28:22.700,"Oh, now, you won't find this in Oxfordshire."
00:28:30.501,00:28:31.709,"Are ye bound for Compiegne, then?"
00:28:33.253,00:28:35.214,"Compiegne, uh, yes."
00:28:41.303,00:28:42.721,"It's a lovely city, wouldn't you agree?"
00:28:45.683,00:28:49.520,"In truth, I wouldn't know, having never been there myself."
00:28:50.062,00:28:50.854,First visit?
00:28:53.357,00:28:54.441,Yes.
00:28:56.610,00:28:58.111,And will you be staying with family?
00:29:00.614,00:29:02.157,Distant family.
00:29:02.199,00:29:03.033,Never met them?
00:29:06.745,00:29:08.747,"No. But I look forward to it, though."
00:29:09.498,00:29:11.584,"A joyous occasion, I imagine."
00:29:14.503,00:29:15.754,One can only hope.
00:29:23.721,00:29:24.763,Hello.
00:29:26.306,00:29:27.474,My name is Claire.
00:29:29.685,00:29:31.770,"Go on, then."
00:29:33.063,00:29:34.273,Hamish.
00:29:34.314,00:29:36.650,"Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you, Hamish."
00:29:36.692,00:29:41.530,I saw you playing earlier today in the courtyard with your father.
00:29:41.572,00:29:42.989,"Yes, surely you remember, Dougal."
00:29:43.031,00:29:44.783,swinging him around.
00:29:58.672,00:29:59.798,"I'm sorry, I..."
00:30:01.800,00:30:03.927,Appear to have made an error.
00:30:03.969,00:30:06.346,I'm the son and heir of Colum MacKenzie.
00:30:06.388,00:30:08.348,Indeed you are.
00:30:18.191,00:30:22.195,I'm afraid the rigors of the past few days have been catching up with me.
00:30:25.574,00:30:26.825,"If you'll excuse me, I..."
00:30:28.661,00:30:30.203,Think I shall retire early tonight.
00:30:35.501,00:30:36.710,"A good night to ye, then..."
00:30:39.129,00:30:40.464,Mrs. Beech-ham.
00:30:57.147,00:31:01.109,CLAIRE: Frank would have laughed and said I fell for the oldest trick in the book...
00:31:01.151,00:31:05.322,"Ply the subject with food and drink, but all the while continuing the interrogation."
00:31:06.573,00:31:10.369,I would have to be more careful if I were to survive the next five days.
00:31:31.431,00:31:32.808,You missed breakfast.
00:31:35.811,00:31:37.145,Still some porridge.
00:31:39.356,00:31:40.440,Warm it for ye?
00:31:40.940,00:31:46.905,"No. I, uh, I was thinking I should change the bandage on Mr. Mactavish's shoulder."
00:31:48.407,00:31:49.658,Jamie.
00:31:52.911,00:31:54.788,Where would I find the stables?
00:31:55.455,00:31:56.915,Top of the meadow.
00:31:57.875,00:31:58.958,To the east.
00:32:51.052,00:32:52.638,Whoa.
00:33:01.438,00:33:02.481,Aye!
00:33:04.942,00:33:06.610,I'm so sorry about that.
00:33:13.450,00:33:15.327,She's just a girl with spirit is all.
00:33:18.246,00:33:19.247,That's always a good thing.
00:33:22.208,00:33:23.460,"What can I do for you, mistress Beauchamp?"
00:33:25.295,00:33:27.005,It's what I can do for you.
00:33:27.046,00:33:28.841,Some fresh bandages and some lunch.
00:33:31.468,00:33:32.594,Aye.
00:33:39.685,00:33:42.270,Quite the appetite.
00:33:42.312,00:33:44.356,I should think you'd eat grass if there was nothing else.
00:33:45.148,00:33:47.233,I have.
00:33:47.275,00:33:49.361,"Doesna taste bad, but it's not very filling."
00:33:50.863,00:33:52.405,You've actually eaten grass?
00:33:53.323,00:33:54.366,Mmm-hmm.
00:33:56.660,00:33:58.036,The winter.
00:33:58.871,00:33:59.955,Year before last.
00:34:00.831,00:34:05.794,"I was living rough, you know, in the woods wi' a group of lads, raiding cattle."
00:34:05.836,00:34:11.550,We'd had poor luck for a week and more and no food amongst us left.
00:34:15.178,00:34:20.600,One might ask why you were raiding cattle and living the life of a thief instead of tending to your own farm.
00:34:25.146,00:34:26.272,There was a price on my head.
00:34:28.191,00:34:30.109,10 pounds sterling.
00:34:30.151,00:34:31.904,A farmer's whole year in these parts.
00:34:36.825,00:34:39.077,Seems excessive for a single escaped prisoner.
00:34:41.413,00:34:42.539,"No, not for escape."
00:34:44.123,00:34:45.083,For murder.
00:34:47.460,00:34:50.213,But I didn't actually kill the man I'm wanted for.
00:34:53.008,00:34:55.052,"You're a very complicated man, Mr. Mactavish."
00:34:56.344,00:34:57.220,Nay.
00:34:59.014,00:35:00.807,"Nay, it's a simple story, really."
00:35:03.060,00:35:05.395,I told you what happened to me at Fort William.
00:35:05.437,00:35:06.980,Mmm-hmm.
00:35:07.022,00:35:12.069,I could hardly move for a day or two after I'd been flogged the second time.
00:35:12.110,00:35:14.487,And I had fever from the wounds.
00:35:14.529,00:35:16.364,"Once I could stand again, though, some..."
00:35:18.408,00:35:24.581,Some friends made shift to get me out of the camp by means I'd best not go into.
00:35:26.499,00:35:32.130,"And there was some ruckus as we left, and a redcoat was shot."
00:35:35.092,00:35:36.134,Not by you.
00:35:37.761,00:35:42.515,"To tell you the truth, I was too weak to do more than hang onto the horse."
00:35:44.684,00:35:46.311,Four years ago now.
00:35:46.352,00:35:47.813,"More like an old dream, but..."
00:35:49.773,00:35:50.899,There it is.
00:35:56.613,00:35:58.698,I take it your real name's not Mr. Mactavish.
00:35:59.825,00:36:00.867,No.
00:36:03.286,00:36:04.287,"No, it's not."
00:36:05.789,00:36:07.124,"A nom de guerre, as it were."
00:36:08.917,00:36:11.086,If you like.
00:36:13.880,00:36:15.507,"You know, it's valuable information, that."
00:36:18.093,00:36:19.094,"You know, I..."
00:36:20.720,00:36:32.565,"I doubt there are informers in the castle itself, but, you know, there might be some about the countryside be glad enough to earn a few pennies by letting the English know where I was, did they know I was a wanted man."
00:36:36.695,00:36:37.737,Does Colum know?
00:36:38.697,00:36:40.323,That I'm an outlaw?
00:36:40.365,00:36:41.407,Mmm-hmm.
00:36:42.117,00:36:44.202,"Aye, aye, Colum knows."
00:36:45.787,00:36:48.123,And Dougal.
00:36:48.165,00:36:50.125,But they're uncles on my mother's side.
00:36:53.045,00:36:54.253,Now I know.
00:36:56.173,00:36:57.507,Why did you tell me?
00:36:59.509,00:37:00.301,You asked.
00:37:03.763,00:37:05.223,That's no answer.
00:37:06.683,00:37:09.394,You could have lied or told me it was none of my business.
00:37:10.812,00:37:12.689,"Well, I suppose I could have."
00:37:12.731,00:37:13.648,Didn't think of that.
00:37:14.900,00:37:16.902,Decided to trust ye instead.
00:37:19.571,00:37:22.281,Are you done stuffing your face while the horses run wild?
00:37:22.323,00:37:24.367,And when will that colt be broken?
00:37:24.409,00:37:26.619,None the sooner for starving myself...
00:37:32.918,00:37:34.544,I best be returning to work.
00:37:36.129,00:37:37.714,"Thank you for the food and the, uh..."
00:37:39.549,00:37:41.927,Just try not to get flogged or stabbed today.
00:37:41.968,00:37:43.261,That'll be thanks enough.
00:37:44.303,00:37:45.805,"No promises, Sassenach."
00:38:02.072,00:38:03.281,Are you following me?
00:38:05.075,00:38:06.451,You are. Why?
00:38:12.624,00:38:14.793,You could at least do me the courtesy of an answer.
00:38:15.794,00:38:17.254,Did Colum tell you to follow me?
00:38:17.503,00:38:18.504,Nah.
00:38:19.380,00:38:21.841,"Dougal, then?"
00:38:21.883,00:38:24.677,"Ken, for a woman, you do ask a fair amount of questions."
00:38:24.719,00:38:25.762,So I've been told.
00:38:25.804,00:38:27.639,"Well, I have nae answers for ye."
00:38:27.680,00:38:29.474,"I am but Dougal's eyes, not his head."
00:38:30.725,00:38:32.351,"But let me warn ye, mistress..."
00:38:32.393,00:38:37.356,These eyes won't be turning their gaze from ye until the head orders me to.
00:38:39.109,00:38:40.235,Psst.
00:38:42.237,00:38:44.281,It could be worse.
00:38:44.322,00:38:49.452,"I'll be sharing guard duty with Angus, and you'll not be finding him as charming as myself."
00:38:49.494,00:38:51.913,He's in his cups more than out of them.
00:38:51.955,00:38:57.418,A fornicator of women and a shagger of wee beasties when there's no women to be found.
00:38:57.460,00:39:05.802,"So I suggest you enjoy me while you can, because you'll be yearning for me when you feel the foul breath of that mad bastard on the back of your neck."
00:39:05.844,00:39:07.386,Lovely.
00:39:07.428,00:39:12.267,"Lucky for you, he prefers female creatures with the tang of the farmyard aboot them."
00:39:12.309,00:39:14.393,Then I'll remember to bathe regularly.
00:39:14.435,00:39:16.437,"Aye, he wouldna ken what to make of that."
00:39:18.857,00:39:22.360,"CLAIRE: Well, clearly, you suspect me of something, or you wouldn't have people watching me."
00:39:22.401,00:39:25.655,"Perhaps you'd be so kind as to give me a notion of your suspicions, or is that too much to..."
00:39:29.450,00:39:31.536,I suspect you may be an English spy.
00:39:33.412,00:39:36.374,A spy? Me?
00:39:36.415,00:39:38.168,Ye have no told the truth about who and what you are.
00:39:38.877,00:39:40.086,Of that I'm sure.
00:39:42.172,00:39:46.009,"And until I am sure of ye, I'll have you watched day and night."
00:39:47.219,00:39:48.803,Now you ken my mind.
00:39:48.845,00:39:50.222,Very well.
00:39:51.348,00:39:55.685,But I think you'll find I'll be doing very little of interest over the next four days.
00:39:55.727,00:39:57.687,I do hope your spies give you a full report.
00:39:57.729,00:39:58.813,Four days?
00:40:01.440,00:40:02.400,Yes.
00:40:03.401,00:40:05.278,I leave with Mr. Petrie on Saturday.
00:40:06.279,00:40:07.822,Forgive me.
00:40:06.279,00:40:09.282,I would've thought your brother would have told you that.
00:40:10.491,00:40:12.327,Perhaps you don't ken his mind.
00:40:21.127,00:40:33.973,"CLAIRE: For the next few days, I determined to maintain a simple routine, both to keep my mind occupied while I awaited the tinker's arrival and to give Dougal's men nothing of the slightest interest to report."
00:40:42.107,00:40:45.277,Mrs. Fitz put me to work helping to harvest food for the kitchen.
00:40:47.445,00:40:55.245,"I found a quiet sense of pleasure in touching growing things once more, felt the satisfaction of helping them thrive."
00:40:57.747,00:40:59.416,WOMAN: Those kind are poison.
00:41:03.420,00:41:04.837,I'm sorry.
00:41:06.631,00:41:10.885,I imagine it was funny from over there.
00:41:10.927,00:41:14.722,"Thanks for the warning, though, but I do know those mushrooms are poisonous."
00:41:14.764,00:41:16.433,Who is it you're planning to do away with?
00:41:17.100,00:41:19.185,"Your husband, perhaps?"
00:41:19.227,00:41:21.146,"Tell me if it works, and I'll try it on mine."
00:41:24.607,00:41:26.651,Actually...
00:41:26.692,00:41:31.489,"Now, while the caps of these mushrooms are poisonous, you can make a powder out of the dried fungi."
00:41:32.740,00:41:35.493,It's very effective in stopping bleeding when applied topically.
00:41:36.286,00:41:37.287,Fancy that.
00:41:40.039,00:41:42.250,My name is Geillis.
00:41:42.292,00:41:44.794,"I'm sorry, I should have introduced myself."
00:41:44.836,00:41:46.879,"I know who you are, Claire."
00:41:46.921,00:41:49.799,The village has been humming with talk of ye since you came to the castle.
00:41:52.510,00:41:54.679,What is it they're saying about me?
00:41:54.720,00:41:56.889,That you're likely a Sassenach spy.
00:42:10.111,00:42:16.617,"You know, those will start bleeding to get rid of a child you don't want."
00:42:17.327,00:42:19.287,Brings on your flux.
00:42:19.329,00:42:21.289,But only if you use it early.
00:42:21.331,00:42:24.917,"Too late, and it can kill you as well as the child."
00:42:27.003,00:42:30.548,The girls in the village come to me every now and again for such things.
00:42:32.800,00:42:33.801,They say I'm a witch.
00:42:34.886,00:42:35.970,Are you?
00:42:37.514,00:42:38.556,Hardly.
00:42:40.641,00:42:46.564,Although I am aware of how wood betony can transform toads into pigeons.
00:42:52.445,00:42:54.572,You should come visit me sometime down in the village.
00:42:55.948,00:42:59.911,I have a cabinet full of potions and medicinals I wager would tickle yer fancy.
00:43:01.454,00:43:04.123,But I hope I'll see you tonight at the hall.
00:43:04.165,00:43:05.375,The hall?
00:43:14.426,00:43:19.305,"CLAIRE: After a week's observation, I diagnosed Colum's condition as Toulouse-Lautrec syndrome."
00:43:22.225,00:43:24.727,Named for its most famous sufferer...
00:43:24.769,00:43:28.273,"Who did not yet exist, I reminded myself."
00:43:28.314,00:43:30.816,It was a degenerative disease of bone and connective tissue.
00:43:38.575,00:43:40.868,Lautrec died at age 38.
00:43:40.910,00:43:47.292,"And given the state of medicine in the 18th century, Colum MacKenzie was most certainly living on borrowed time."
00:43:50.503,00:43:55.007,"Masters William Talbot and Fingal Duncan, will ye stand forth?"
00:44:02.807,00:44:04.642,They're neighbors.
00:44:04.683,00:44:06.644,Having a dispute over a cow.
00:44:07.895,00:44:08.938,A cow?
00:44:22.160,00:44:23.328,He says...
00:44:23.369,00:44:25.538,"Well, let me see."
00:44:25.580,00:44:27.290,It's all right.
00:44:27.332,00:44:29.292,I have the feeling something would be lost in translation.
00:44:29.334,00:44:31.710,"Kyle Ferguson, step forward and present yourself."
00:44:41.762,00:44:43.598,They're fighting over some property.
00:45:03.993,00:45:04.827,Uh-oh.
00:45:06.787,00:45:09.874,accuses her of loose behavior.
00:45:17.048,00:45:20.717,Her father wishes the MacKenzie to have her punished for disobedience.
00:45:46.369,00:45:47.453,No.
00:46:18.067,00:46:19.776,He's offering to take the girl's punishment.
00:46:20.152,00:46:21.279,What?
00:46:22.530,00:46:23.989,But he's still injured.
00:46:24.031,00:46:25.366,Mmm-hmm.
00:46:30.121,00:46:32.039,They're arguing it now.
00:46:55.647,00:46:56.813,He allows it.
00:47:08.326,00:47:10.495,He chooses fists.
00:47:11.537,00:47:12.829,Rather than the strap.
00:47:16.125,00:47:19.211,"wanted a beating, I'd been happy to oblige ye."
00:47:19.253,00:47:20.963,"Aye, but..."
00:47:21.005,00:47:22.423,You might have done some real damage.
00:47:22.465,00:47:24.216,"Watch yourself, laddie."
00:47:24.258,00:47:25.842,Your uncle is up to something.
00:48:22.983,00:48:24.694,must this go on for?
00:48:24.736,00:48:26.821,Only until blood's drawn.
00:48:26.863,00:48:28.531,Usually when their nose is broken.
00:48:37.164,00:48:38.499,This is barbarous.
00:48:58.269,00:48:59.353,Ahhh.
00:49:22.835,00:49:23.960,"Claire, stay here."
00:50:24.313,00:50:26.106,"This way is quicker, and you'll stir less gossip."
00:50:34.156,00:50:35.031,Here.
00:50:37.326,00:50:38.202,Why did you do that?
00:50:39.537,00:50:40.955,Take that girl's punishment?
00:50:42.540,00:50:43.541,Do you know her?
00:50:48.004,00:50:49.171,Ken who she is.
00:50:50.923,00:50:52.508,"Haven't really spoken to her, though."
00:50:54.426,00:50:55.636,Then why?
00:50:58.054,00:51:03.895,It would have shamed the lass to have been beaten in the hall before everyone that knows her.
00:51:03.936,00:51:05.312,Taken a long time to get over it.
00:51:06.271,00:51:08.064,It's easier for me.
00:51:09.775,00:51:12.444,"I'm sore, but I'm nae really damaged."
00:51:13.863,00:51:15.489,I'll get over it in a couple days.
00:51:16.615,00:51:19.577,"Oh, here ye are, lad."
00:51:19.618,00:51:20.912,Rinse your mouth with this.
00:51:22.162,00:51:24.080,It'll cleanse the cuts and ease the pain.
00:51:24.874,00:51:28.002,"Willow bark tea, with a bit of ground orris root."
00:51:28.044,00:51:29.085,Ground up well.
00:51:30.504,00:51:31.505,Top of life.
00:51:33.215,00:51:34.926,"What you did was kindly meant, lad."
00:51:38.136,00:51:39.722,"Laoghaire is my granddaughter, ye ken?"
00:51:51.358,00:51:53.193,Take that bandage off your shoulder in the next two days.
00:51:55.404,00:51:57.073,Would it not be easier if you did that?
00:51:57.113,00:52:00.158,"Yes, but I'll be gone."
00:52:00.200,00:52:02.118,I'm leaving with Mr. Petrie tomorrow.
00:52:04.371,00:52:05.414,Ah.
00:52:06.457,00:52:07.499,I see.
00:52:11.378,00:52:12.379,Well...
00:52:15.257,00:52:17.676,Then perhaps this is goodbye.
00:52:19.428,00:52:20.554,Yes.
00:52:25.810,00:52:29.021,"I think someone would like to speak with you, alone."
00:52:29.480,00:52:30.564,Aye.
00:52:34.110,00:52:35.193,"Well, goodbye to you, then, Jamie."
00:52:37.071,00:52:39.531,"Safe journeys to ye, Claire."
00:53:01.470,00:53:05.223,"The bannocks should last a day or two, and the cheese will keep for a week."
00:53:05.265,00:53:07.768,"You've been too kind, Mrs. Fitzgibbons."
00:53:07.810,00:53:08.853,I can't thank you enough.
00:53:08.894,00:53:10.312,"Think nothing o' it, lass."
00:53:14.692,00:53:16.192,Safe journey to ye.
00:53:22.908,00:53:24.200,Colum wishes to see ye.
00:53:24.242,00:53:25.201,Why?
00:53:26.829,00:53:28.122,It doesna matter why.
00:53:30.875,00:53:32.126,All right.
00:53:33.293,00:53:34.252,I'll be back in a minute.
00:53:53.772,00:53:55.231,Come on.
00:53:56.358,00:53:58.234,"Three, two, one."
00:53:58.986,00:54:00.029,Something wrong?
00:54:01.488,00:54:02.573,No.
00:54:37.149,00:54:38.316,"Good day to ye, Mrs. Beauchamp."
00:54:38.734,00:54:40.069,Good day.
00:54:40.111,00:54:42.780,"Ye have no connections with clan Beaton, have ye?"
00:54:45.323,00:54:47.492,The Beatons? No.
00:54:47.534,00:54:50.788,The healers of Clan Beaton are famous through the highlands.
00:54:50.829,00:54:56.292,"We had one here, until he caught a fever which carried him off within a week."
00:54:57.002,00:54:58.294,Davie Beaton was his name.
00:55:00.005,00:55:03.008,"And this was his surgery, he called it."
00:55:03.592,00:55:04.635,Really?
00:55:09.265,00:55:11.016,All this...
00:55:11.058,00:55:12.308,And no one to share it with?
00:55:23.361,00:55:26.740,I understand you have quite some skill as a healer yourself.
00:55:28.200,00:55:29.325,"It's an interest of mine, yes."
00:55:33.580,00:55:35.874,You know the uses of these potions and things?
00:55:36.583,00:55:37.709,Some.
00:55:38.961,00:55:40.462,This is all really fascinating.
00:55:41.337,00:55:42.338,Thank you for showing me.
00:55:43.174,00:55:45.176,"But I, I must be going."
00:55:45.217,00:55:51.347,"Seeing as we have not had a healer since Davie passed, I want you to take up the work."
00:55:53.225,00:55:54.350,But I'm leaving.
00:55:55.769,00:55:57.562,No. You're staying.
00:56:02.985,00:56:04.402,What did Dougal say to you?
00:56:04.444,00:56:06.197,Did one of his thugs make up lies about me?
00:56:08.949,00:56:10.784,My brother keeps his own counsel on you.
00:56:11.827,00:56:13.162,This is my decision.
00:56:13.996,00:56:15.998,Then why am I staying?
00:56:16.040,00:56:19.001,Because it is my pleasure that you do so.
00:56:19.043,00:56:21.295,Because you think I'm a spy.
00:56:21.337,00:56:23.088,Surely you don't believe that.
00:56:24.589,00:56:28.510,"I believe that you have secrets, Claire."
00:56:28.552,00:56:35.391,"Now, maybe they're the kind of secrets that every woman has, which pose no threat to me, to Leoch, or to clan MacKenzie."
00:56:36.768,00:56:40.772,"But until I know for sure, you will remain here..."
00:56:42.774,00:56:44.276,As my guest.
00:56:52.243,00:56:53.618,"You mean as your prisoner, don't you?"
00:57:01.126,00:57:02.586,Only if you try to leave.
00:00:01.460,00:00:03.002,CLAIRE: Previously...
00:00:03.044,00:00:05.046,We were in Scotland on our second honeymoon.
00:00:06.882,00:00:09.551,"I wanted it to be a dream, but I knew it wasn't."
00:00:09.593,00:00:12.095,I was no longer in the 20th century.
00:00:12.137,00:00:15.557,It was like landing on an alien world you'd only glimpsed through a telescope.
00:00:15.599,00:00:16.851,Are you following me?
00:00:16.892,00:00:19.060,"I am but Dougal's eyes, no his heid."
00:00:19.102,00:00:21.146,I suspect you may be an English spy.
00:00:21.188,00:00:22.272,My name is Geillis Duncan.
00:00:22.314,00:00:24.566,I hope I'll see you tonight at the hall.
00:00:26.443,00:00:28.153,He's offering to take the girl's punishment.
00:00:29.822,00:00:33.993,You need not be scared of me nor anyone else here as long as I'm with ye.
00:00:34.034,00:00:37.204,You will remain here as my guest.
00:00:37.245,00:00:39.164,"You mean as your prisoner, don't you?"
00:00:39.206,00:00:40.541,Only if you try to leave.
00:02:23.852,00:02:25.646,I contacted Colonel Halligan.
00:02:25.687,00:02:29.066,He said it might be a week before he can issue a new set of orders.
00:02:29.108,00:02:31.735,"Frank, I don't feel it's right to use your connections."
00:02:31.777,00:02:33.612,"What of these men, they've no one to change their orders."
00:02:33.654,00:02:35.447,I don't understand why you would want to even...
00:02:35.489,00:02:38.033,What I want is my husband at home with me.
00:02:38.075,00:02:40.494,But I can't have that right now.
00:02:40.535,00:02:46.249,"And if people use the system to their own benefit, then we might as well just give up the ship and start speaking German."
00:02:46.291,00:02:48.418,"Please, listen to reason, if not your husband."
00:02:49.044,00:02:52.798,"Darling, it will be all right."
00:02:52.840,00:02:54.382,I'll be all right.
00:02:56.051,00:02:57.552,You have to trust me on this.
00:03:00.764,00:03:03.767,Woe betide the man that stands between you and what you set your mind upon.
00:03:05.268,00:03:10.065,And damned if that stubbornness isn't what I find so attractive about you.
00:03:12.818,00:03:14.193,CONDUCTOR: All aboard!
00:03:18.157,00:03:19.366,All aboard!
00:03:22.786,00:03:24.746,"As they say, that's my cue."
00:03:34.840,00:03:36.466,I should be the one leaving for the front lines.
00:03:38.385,00:03:40.428,Welcome to the 20th century.
00:03:40.470,00:03:44.599,"Please, don't take any unnecessary risks I won't."
00:03:50.522,00:03:54.818,"Claire Beauchamp Randall, promise that you'll return to me."
00:03:56.862,00:03:58.238,"I will, Frank Randall."
00:03:58.780,00:03:59.865,I promise.
00:04:15.255,00:04:16.256,MRS. FITZ: Bloody hell.
00:04:16.798,00:04:18.633,"Aye, a bit brisk?"
00:04:18.675,00:04:20.260,Keeps you clearheaded and strong though.
00:04:23.055,00:04:26.141,"I really can wash and dress myself, you know."
00:04:26.183,00:04:28.268,"Oh, I don't mind helping you."
00:04:30.311,00:04:32.647,Such beautiful skin you have.
00:04:33.982,00:04:38.319,I've never seen a woman past eight or nine with skin so unmarked by injury or illness.
00:04:40.114,00:04:42.157,Your next husband will be a lucky man.
00:04:47.788,00:04:49.372,What's wrong?
00:04:52.626,00:04:57.089,"Mrs. Fitz, can I tell you something?"
00:04:57.965,00:04:59.299,Of course you can.
00:05:07.766,00:05:08.809,He's not dead.
00:05:10.936,00:05:12.395,Have you run away from him?
00:05:12.437,00:05:13.855,Was he no a good man?
00:05:13.897,00:05:15.356,"No, he's wonderful."
00:05:16.191,00:05:17.234,"It's just, well..."
00:05:19.278,00:05:20.445,He hasn't been born yet.
00:05:27.452,00:05:32.332,"Mrs. Fitz, I seem to have fallen through time."
00:05:34.876,00:05:42.843,"I was on my honeymoon in 1945, 200 years from now."
00:05:42.884,00:05:46.345,"It was Samhain, and I went to the stone circle at Craigh na Dun."
00:05:48.807,00:05:49.724,Do you know it?
00:05:51.310,00:05:52.351,Aye.
00:05:54.062,00:05:56.315,I've heard strange tales.
00:05:56.355,00:05:58.108,"I touched the stone, and it..."
00:05:59.276,00:06:07.909,"The world just spun out of control, and the next thing I knew, I was here in 1743."
00:06:10.245,00:06:11.579,I'm not an English spy.
00:06:15.000,00:06:16.375,I'm from the future.
00:06:20.214,00:06:21.631,It's a lot to take to mind.
00:06:28.889,00:06:30.307,I can hardly believe it myself.
00:06:33.227,00:06:35.603,I don't even know if I can travel forward to my own time.
00:06:40.817,00:06:42.319,I have to get back to the stones.
00:06:43.320,00:06:45.655,Is it my help you're asking?
00:06:45.697,00:06:48.700,Do you think the Mackenzies would believe me if I told them the truth?
00:06:48.742,00:06:50.202,Perhaps.
00:06:50.244,00:06:54.122,"You're fair of eye and honeyed of tongue, but I see you now for what you are."
00:06:55.165,00:06:56.333,What?
00:06:56.375,00:06:58.210,"Be gone, evil demon."
00:06:58.252,00:06:59.627,I abjure thee!
00:06:59.669,00:07:01.922,"No, Mrs. Fitz..."
00:07:01.963,00:07:03.382,I'll not let you spell me.
00:07:03.422,00:07:05.342,"Mrs. Fitz, no!"
00:07:06.801,00:07:07.844,"MRS. FITZ: Oh, aye."
00:07:09.054,00:07:12.224,Hundred of Mackenzies will be turning up in the next few days for the gathering.
00:07:13.433,00:07:15.018,"Are you listening to me, child?"
00:07:17.020,00:07:18.272,"Sorry, what?"
00:07:18.313,00:07:20.023,Gathering?
00:07:20.065,00:07:22.609,I'm not familiar with that term.
00:07:22.650,00:07:28.615,This where all the Mackenzie men throughout the highlands come and plight their oath to the clan and himself.
00:07:28.656,00:07:32.827,Last one was decades ago when Colum was made laird.
00:07:32.869,00:07:36.039,I'm fair glad you're here to handle the physicking.
00:07:36.081,00:07:38.292,I have enough to manage without dealing with folks' ailments.
00:07:41.211,00:07:43.213,You do well with that.
00:07:43.255,00:07:45.506,Dougal and himself will not forget it.
00:07:45.548,00:07:47.926,"You'll be in their good graces, make no mistake."
00:07:51.054,00:07:57.769,"CLAIRE: If I could get in Colum and Dougal's good graces, perhaps I could win my release and begin to make my way back to Frank."
00:07:58.519,00:08:03.900,"For headache, take ye one ball of horse dung."
00:08:03.942,00:08:05.152,It is to be carefully dried.
00:08:05.193,00:08:20.792,"Medicine and caring for the people of the clan Mackenzie seemed the most logical way for me to earn their trust, but in order to do that without raising suspicion, I would have to find a way to apply 20th century medicine using only the methods and equipment available in the 18th."
00:08:20.834,00:08:22.043,Slaters.
00:08:26.756,00:08:29.343,Woodlice!
00:08:45.025,00:08:50.113,"CLAIRE: Alongside the jars of pigeons' blood, ant eggs, and powdered human skull..."
00:08:52.115,00:08:56.453,There were a number of herbs and extractions in Beaton's collection that might actually be helpful.
00:09:15.472,00:09:17.807,"Now, wasn't so bad, was it?"
00:09:24.356,00:09:29.319,CLAIRE: My guards began to spend their time in the kitchen while I was seeing patients.
00:09:29.361,00:09:36.284,"I told myself this was a good sign, a sign of trust, a feeling they hopefully would share with Dougal."
00:09:36.326,00:09:38.119,"Excuse me, gentlemen."
00:09:38.161,00:09:40.247,I could use some help in the surgery.
00:09:40.288,00:09:42.249,The discarded medicines need to be disposed of.
00:09:42.290,00:09:45.793,What are you two drunkards still doing taking up space in my kitchen?
00:09:45.835,00:09:47.670,"If you're not working here, be gone with ye."
00:09:47.712,00:09:50.882,We're just following orders keeping an eye on this one.
00:09:50.924,00:09:53.593,"Oh, and has she been hiding at the bottom of your mug for the past two hours?"
00:09:56.637,00:09:58.473,"Oh, Shona."
00:09:58.515,00:10:00.350,Dinna fash yourself over this.
00:10:01.017,00:10:02.310,Go on home now.
00:10:02.352,00:10:03.728,Be with your other wee bairns.
00:10:07.148,00:10:08.400,Carry on working.
00:10:12.404,00:10:13.613,Who was that?
00:10:14.448,00:10:16.074,Colum's chambermaid.
00:10:16.116,00:10:17.867,Is she going to be all right?
00:10:17.909,00:10:19.660,"Aye, in time."
00:10:22.663,00:10:26.376,"Her boy died last night, wee Lindsay Macneill."
00:10:29.087,00:10:30.630,What happened?
00:10:30.671,00:10:32.799,Why did nobody come and get me?
00:10:32.840,00:10:36.886,"Oh, Miss, what ailed wee Lindsay has no mortal cure."
00:10:36.928,00:10:39.013,"He went up to an eaghais dhubh, he did."
00:10:39.931,00:10:41.682,Where?
00:10:41.724,00:10:43.684,The old ruins of the Benedictine monastery.
00:10:45.103,00:10:47.688,Folk hereabout call it the Black Kirk.
00:10:49.566,00:10:52.652,You think somehow the ruins killed him?
00:10:52.693,00:10:55.238,"It was not the ruins, you daft woman."
00:10:55.280,00:10:57.616,It was the demons who roam free inside the ruins.
00:10:57.657,00:10:59.242,Poor wee soul.
00:10:59.284,00:11:00.868,Sickly boy on his best day.
00:11:01.828,00:11:03.371,No match for old Nick.
00:11:08.543,00:11:11.754,"The Mackenzie requests your presence in his chambers, mistress Beauchamp."
00:11:13.089,00:11:15.758,"Have you never heard of a comb, you wee gomeril?"
00:11:15.800,00:11:17.302,"Aw, leave off, auntie."
00:11:17.344,00:11:19.179,"My nephew, Tammas Baxter."
00:11:20.472,00:11:22.349,Lindsay Macneill was like a brother to him.
00:11:23.433,00:11:24.683,Mackenzie's waiting.
00:11:25.893,00:11:27.312,Right.
00:11:27.354,00:11:29.397,The medicines are on the step.
00:11:49.000,00:11:52.212,CLAIRE: I wished I had the ability to treat Colum.
00:11:52.253,00:11:58.717,"It would alleviate what I knew was a great deal of pain, and it would certainly make Colum see me in a more favorable light."
00:12:11.939,00:12:15.193,It'll be a trifle longer than your standard frock coat.
00:12:17.404,00:12:20.823,"Well, you're hardly standard, now, are you, my Laird?"
00:12:20.865,00:12:23.868,A one-of-a-kind coat for a one-of-a-kind man.
00:12:26.329,00:12:32.960,"I was told that you're the finest tailor in the highlands, come fresh from Edinburgh."
00:12:33.002,00:12:35.213,"Well, I thank you, my Laird."
00:12:35.255,00:12:40.176,"My wife's people are Mackenzies, and I'm always happy for a chance to bring her home."
00:12:41.386,00:12:44.763,And did your wife's people encourage you to mock your laird?
00:12:46.224,00:12:47.684,Mock?
00:12:47.726,00:12:51.688,Does not a man's coat usually fall just to the knee?
00:12:52.439,00:12:53.856,Yes.
00:12:52.439,00:12:57.235,And did I ask you for anything different than that?
00:12:57.277,00:13:00.614,"Well, no, not explicitly, but, um, I just thought..."
00:13:00.655,00:13:02.616,That my legs should be hidden?
00:13:04.409,00:13:06.536,That I have something to be ashamed of?
00:13:06.578,00:13:07.828,I would never presume.
00:13:10.039,00:13:10.831,My Laird...
00:13:13.209,00:13:14.252,Please.
00:13:20.091,00:13:26.180,You make me a standard frock coat and have it back to me by tomorrow.
00:13:27.432,00:13:28.725,"Of course, my Laird."
00:13:28.767,00:13:29.808,"Thank you, my Laird."
00:13:35.022,00:13:35.940,Thank you.
00:13:43.657,00:13:46.534,"Do you sew as well as physick, mistress Beauchamp?"
00:13:48.244,00:13:51.539,"Only flesh, which makes a rather poor garment, I'm afraid."
00:13:53.500,00:13:56.210,"Just as well, I called you here on another matter."
00:14:01.633,00:14:03.009,Davy Beaton...
00:14:03.718,00:14:04.719,He used to massage me.
00:14:05.553,00:14:06.929,It made movement easier.
00:14:11.184,00:14:11.976,Of course.
00:14:24.905,00:14:26.741,What's wrong?
00:14:26.783,00:14:30.244,Do you find my legs as repellent as the tailor does?
00:14:31.162,00:14:32.622,"No, it's just..."
00:14:33.956,00:14:38.085,"Well, I believe it'd be more beneficial if rather than your legs, I massaged the base of your spine."
00:14:39.045,00:14:39.879,Mmm.
00:14:46.927,00:14:48.888,Don't tell me my arse offends you too.
00:14:57.938,00:15:01.442,Moist heat is usually quite soothing after a massage.
00:15:01.484,00:15:03.778,Is there any water for boiling or some clean cloth?
00:15:04.237,00:15:06.072,No.
00:15:06.113,00:15:09.909,"Mrs. Macneill, my chambermaid, she lost her son last night."
00:15:11.285,00:15:13.120,She hasn't been in this morning.
00:15:15.122,00:15:15.915,Aye.
00:15:16.708,00:15:17.834,It's Satan's work.
00:15:19.168,00:15:20.086,The foolish child...
00:15:21.629,00:15:23.214,He went up to the Black Kirk.
00:15:28.344,00:15:33.349,Sometimes I wonder what I did to make the devil punish me like this.
00:15:39.731,00:15:42.942,"What, you don't have demons in Oxfordshire, mistress?"
00:15:45.278,00:15:49.699,"We do, but we call them Scots."
00:15:58.082,00:16:00.000,"Sorry, did I hurt you?"
00:16:02.128,00:16:03.880,On the contrary.
00:16:03.922,00:16:05.757,You're easing the pain considerably.
00:16:10.511,00:16:15.516,"Gwyllyn the bard, he'll be singing in the hall tonight before the gathering."
00:16:15.558,00:16:17.977,I'd like you to come along as my guest.
00:16:20.354,00:16:21.314,Thank you.
00:16:53.972,00:16:55.264,My brother looks very well tonight.
00:16:57.224,00:16:59.393,He says it's down to you and your healing touch.
00:17:02.355,00:17:03.564,I'm glad I could be of service.
00:17:05.483,00:17:09.654,Aye. Seems that the feral cat we picked up on the road is trying to pull in her claws.
00:17:11.865,00:17:13.574,What a charming description.
00:17:18.663,00:17:20.748,Hmm.
00:17:18.663,00:17:22.876,"If you'll excuse me, I believe I'll have a better view from over there."
00:17:44.313,00:17:45.857,Hello.
00:17:45.899,00:17:48.526,We've not been properly introduced.
00:17:48.568,00:17:49.569,Laoghaire Mackenzie.
00:17:56.993,00:17:58.912,"Cuts quite the fine figure, Mr. Mactavish."
00:17:58.953,00:18:00.079,Aye.
00:18:06.377,00:18:07.545,But it's not me he fancies.
00:18:10.048,00:18:13.051,"Well, men rarely know what's best for them."
00:18:13.092,00:18:14.301,That's what us women are for.
00:18:16.262,00:18:17.096,Laoghaire.
00:18:18.014,00:18:19.098,Mrs. Beauchamp.
00:18:19.682,00:18:21.726,Mr. Mactavish.
00:18:21.768,00:18:24.270,I was just telling Miss Mackenzie how beautiful she looked tonight.
00:18:42.830,00:18:46.500,"I don't understand a word, but it's so beautiful."
00:18:53.591,00:18:55.301,Has Gwyllyn been at the castle long?
00:18:55.342,00:18:56.302,Aye.
00:18:57.595,00:18:59.346,Many years.
00:18:59.388,00:19:01.682,I spent a year at Leoch when I was 16 or so.
00:19:02.767,00:19:04.894,Gwyllyn was here then.
00:19:04.936,00:19:07.605,Colum pays him well.
00:19:07.647,00:19:10.149,The Welshman would be welcome at any laird's hearth.
00:19:11.275,00:19:13.152,I remember when you were here before.
00:19:13.193,00:19:15.613,"Mmm, do you?"
00:19:15.655,00:19:17.239,You canna been much more than seven or eight yourself.
00:19:18.992,00:19:22.286,I doubt I was much to see then so as to be remembered.
00:19:22.328,00:19:24.705,"Well, I do remember, though."
00:19:24.747,00:19:28.542,"You were so, I mean, do you not remember me from then?"
00:19:29.585,00:19:31.587,"No. No, I dinna think so."
00:19:33.631,00:19:35.299,"Still, I wouldna even be likely to."
00:19:37.551,00:19:44.809,A young birkie of 16's too taken up with his own grand self to pay much heed to what he thinks are naught but a rabble of snot-nosed bairns.
00:20:06.330,00:20:07.623,Mmm.
00:20:07.665,00:20:09.333,"Colum's rhenish, is it?"
00:20:09.375,00:20:10.960,It's very good.
00:20:11.002,00:20:13.420,I've had two...
00:20:14.547,00:20:15.756,You can have the rest if you like.
00:20:16.841,00:20:20.720,Most folks who drink with Colum are under the table after the second glass.
00:20:20.761,00:20:22.513,Are you implying that I'm intoxicated?
00:20:24.140,00:20:25.391,I'd be impressed if you weren't.
00:20:42.742,00:20:46.245,This dressing's been chafing me for days.
00:20:46.286,00:20:48.956,Would you mind helping me with it?
00:20:48.998,00:20:50.208,Well...
00:20:51.918,00:20:53.252,"Yes, of course."
00:20:55.421,00:20:56.839,"Take that back, will you, lass?"
00:21:09.602,00:21:11.979,"All right, so let's have a look at that shoulder."
00:21:12.021,00:21:13.606,"Uh, I dinna need your help."
00:21:13.647,00:21:15.024,Hmm?
00:21:15.066,00:21:18.277,I just thought I should see you back to surgery while you could still walk upright.
00:21:21.239,00:21:22.907,Thank you.
00:21:22.949,00:21:24.658,I suppose I did overindulge slightly.
00:21:26.410,00:21:28.079,"I should have known, though."
00:21:28.121,00:21:32.458,"If it was really uncomfortable, I imagine you would have just ripped off the bandages yourself."
00:21:32.499,00:21:34.252,"Oh, I was afraid to."
00:21:34.293,00:21:35.294,Thought I'd get my arse skelped if I touched it.
00:21:35.711,00:21:37.504,Too right.
00:21:40.133,00:21:41.259,Never doubted it.
00:21:44.262,00:21:47.723,"Really, though, if it was bothering you, you should have told me."
00:21:47.765,00:21:49.683,I would have taken it off for you the other day at the stables.
00:21:49.725,00:21:52.270,No.
00:21:54.772,00:21:56.732,Scars.
00:21:56.774,00:21:58.692,You don't want Alec to know you've been flogged?
00:22:00.236,00:22:01.528,No. No.
00:22:02.571,00:22:06.242,"Old Alec knows I've been flogged, but he's not seen it."
00:22:07.451,00:22:09.662,To know something like that is...
00:22:09.703,00:22:11.664,"Well, it's not the same as seeing it with your own eyes."
00:22:14.917,00:22:17.878,"It's a bit personal, maybe, is what I mean."
00:22:19.839,00:22:25.303,"I think if Alec were to see the scars, he couldna see me anymore without thinking of my back."
00:22:27.972,00:22:29.347,You don't mind me seeing your back?
00:22:30.308,00:22:32.392,I don't.
00:22:32.434,00:22:37.397,You seem to have a knack for letting me know you feel sorry for it without making me feel pitiful about it.
00:22:46.115,00:22:47.365,Anyway...
00:22:48.826,00:22:49.869,I should go.
00:22:51.662,00:22:52.705,Wait.
00:22:56.125,00:22:57.043,Let me have a look at that.
00:23:22.235,00:23:23.861,It's scabbed over nicely.
00:23:24.653,00:23:25.696,There's no drainage.
00:23:34.288,00:23:36.498,Take those bandages off in a few days.
00:23:39.793,00:23:40.711,As you say.
00:23:44.924,00:23:46.008,"Good night, Mr. Mactavish."
00:23:47.718,00:23:49.929,"Good night, mistress Beauchamp."
00:24:11.617,00:24:14.370,"Do you never sit down, woman?"
00:24:14.412,00:24:16.454,My breakfast's barely past my gullet.
00:24:17.331,00:24:19.292,Walking is good for digestion.
00:24:22.002,00:24:23.837,Claire.
00:24:23.879,00:24:26.590,"Ah, I'm so glad you could join me."
00:24:26.632,00:24:27.591,Wouldn't have missed it.
00:24:30.803,00:24:32.430,This just keeps getting worse.
00:24:32.470,00:24:36.100,Got stuck walking with that pompous windbag Father Bain.
00:24:36.142,00:24:38.560,He plans to perform an exorcism on the Baxter boy.
00:24:38.602,00:24:40.646,Hawthorn berries.
00:24:41.981,00:24:43.941,You rarely see these so late in season.
00:24:45.151,00:24:47.153,Did you just say exorcism?
00:24:47.194,00:24:52.366,Apparently Tammas Baxter went to the Black Kirk with wee Lindsay Macneill.
00:24:52.408,00:24:54.952,Now the young fool is seized with the same evil.
00:24:54.994,00:24:55.911,Do you want some?
00:24:56.412,00:24:57.455,No.
00:24:59.165,00:25:00.249,What is it?
00:25:01.125,00:25:02.751,What's wrong with you?
00:25:02.793,00:25:05.963,"Well, the boy, Tammas, he's Mrs. Fitz's nephew."
00:25:08.674,00:25:11.135,"When you say seized with evil, what exactly do you mean?"
00:25:11.885,00:25:13.262,Is he ill?
00:25:14.305,00:25:16.514,He's not ill.
00:25:18.851,00:25:20.769,"Do you not believe in demonic possession, Claire?"
00:25:20.811,00:25:21.812,Do you?
00:25:24.064,00:25:26.192,I believe there are powers beyond our ken...
00:25:28.777,00:25:31.489,Beyond what we can see and hear and touch.
00:25:33.324,00:25:36.369,"Demon, fairy, devil, doesn't matter what name we put on them."
00:25:39.079,00:25:41.539,"But you believe in the powers of magic, do you not?"
00:25:43.292,00:25:44.710,Haven't really thought much about it.
00:25:46.753,00:25:52.051,Have you never found yourself in a situation that has no earthly explanation?
00:25:54.594,00:26:01.227,You have to admit it's certainly possible the boy's actually sick and not possessed.
00:26:01.268,00:26:04.021,"And if that's the case, then perhaps there's something you and I can do to help."
00:26:06.190,00:26:08.566,"People believe the boy is possessed, Claire."
00:26:09.985,00:26:12.279,You challenge that at your peril.
00:26:12.321,00:26:13.989,"I'll not go near him, and neither should you."
00:26:22.748,00:26:23.581,Hey!
00:26:35.344,00:26:37.471,"Hey, where you goin'?"
00:26:45.645,00:26:49.607,Colum will not like you interfering with the workings of the spirits.
00:26:50.234,00:26:51.609,It's not your place.
00:26:56.532,00:26:57.866,I thought that might change your mind.
00:26:59.617,00:27:03.038,A priest once told me my healing skills were a gift from God.
00:27:22.308,00:27:24.184,My sister has gone to fetch Father Bain.
00:27:26.145,00:27:27.771,Why is he tied?
00:27:27.813,00:27:29.482,In case he gets violent.
00:27:29.523,00:27:31.567,"The demons, you ken."
00:27:31.609,00:27:32.734,Shh.
00:27:32.776,00:27:35.070,"Tammas, Tammas, I'm here to help."
00:27:36.780,00:27:38.491,Are his symptoms similar to that of the other boy?
00:27:38.532,00:27:40.658,"MRS. FITZ: Aye, much the same."
00:27:40.700,00:27:43.996,"Wee Lindsay was weak to begin with, so the devil took him much faster."
00:27:44.788,00:27:49.209,"CLAIRE: No fever, which meant it probably wasn't an infection."
00:27:50.377,00:27:51.587,Are any of the others ill?
00:27:51.629,00:27:54.507,"No, all right as rain."
00:27:54.548,00:27:58.344,"His heart rate was slow and pupils pinpoints, a sign of poisoning."
00:27:58.385,00:28:01.347,Tammas? Tammas?
00:28:01.388,00:28:02.722,What have you eaten recently?
00:28:02.764,00:28:07.727,"MRS. FITZ: He's taken nothing but a bit of broth in the last day, and most of that he brought back up again."
00:28:07.769,00:28:10.105,don't come near me.
00:28:10.147,00:28:11.482,He sees the demons even now.
00:28:11.524,00:28:14.276,It's all right.
00:28:14.318,00:28:16.362,It's another symptom.
00:28:16.403,00:28:18.238,Give me something to cut these ropes.
00:28:18.280,00:28:19.739,"No, Miss."
00:28:20.407,00:28:21.659,I should say not.
00:28:23.410,00:28:24.744,"What are you doing, Glenna?"
00:28:24.786,00:28:26.788,Letting a stranger in at a time like this?
00:28:26.830,00:28:29.333,Mistress Beauchamp is a healer and a good one.
00:28:29.375,00:28:30.626,She may be able to help.
00:28:35.548,00:28:38.384,"Mrs. Baxter, he needs to be unbound and fresh air let in."
00:28:40.469,00:28:42.179,I believe I can ease his suffering.
00:28:42.221,00:28:43.430,Just give me a chance.
00:28:55.859,00:28:57.236,"Best make way now, lass."
00:28:59.112,00:29:00.614,Let the father do his work.
00:29:38.026,00:29:39.486,ANGUS: Did you feel a chill when you got near him?
00:29:39.528,00:29:41.488,A chill?
00:29:39.528,00:29:44.450,"Well, they say you can feel Old Nick's presence by the chill in the air."
00:29:44.491,00:29:46.285,"Sorry to disappoint, no."
00:29:46.326,00:29:48.245,"He must have been speaking in tongues, eh?"
00:29:48.287,00:29:49.663,I'm afraid not.
00:29:49.705,00:29:52.666,"Well, I heard tell that wee Lindsay howled in five..."
00:29:53.333,00:29:54.918,"Lazy, fat bastard."
00:29:56.545,00:29:57.713,Wait right here.
00:30:04.428,00:30:09.933,CLAIRE: I felt sure Mrs. Fitz would let me examine the boy after the good father finished his incantation.
00:30:09.975,00:30:16.607,"But even if I could figure out what was wrong with him, I might not be able to do anything about it with the limited resources at hand."
00:30:30.370,00:30:32.498,"Good, very good."
00:30:32.539,00:30:34.833,You ken how to obey a man's orders for once.
00:30:35.125,00:30:36.293,Move.
00:30:46.094,00:30:48.263,"Your lip looks a little swollen, Jamie."
00:30:48.305,00:30:49.515,Did you get thumped by a horse?
00:30:54.019,00:30:54.894,Aye.
00:31:00.066,00:31:01.401,That's too bad.
00:31:01.443,00:31:02.695,Those fillies can be dangerous.
00:31:05.531,00:31:07.741,ANGUS: Fillies?
00:31:07.783,00:31:08.908,Alec has you working the fillies now?
00:31:13.747,00:31:14.873,ANGUS: Hey!
00:31:17.042,00:31:18.877,What's wrong with you?
00:31:20.713,00:31:21.839,Clumsy dolt.
00:31:24.216,00:31:25.884,I best go see if Alec wants anything else.
00:31:35.143,00:31:38.522,"Hey, if you're teasing the lad about Laoghaire..."
00:31:38.564,00:31:43.193,"If her father or Colum comes to know about it, young Jamie could get more than a bloodied nose."
00:31:44.277,00:31:45.278,Like a wife?
00:31:46.196,00:31:47.906,Maybe.
00:31:47.947,00:31:49.449,That's not the wife he should have.
00:31:50.200,00:31:51.117,No?
00:31:51.159,00:31:52.703,No.
00:31:52.745,00:31:55.080,"He needs a woman, not a lassie."
00:31:57.082,00:31:58.917,And Laoghaire will be a girl until she's 50.
00:32:02.504,00:32:09.261,"I've been around long enough to ken the difference very well, and so do you, mistress."
00:32:29.364,00:32:36.455,"CLAIRE: I felt ashamed of the way I'd teased Jamie, and if I was being perfectly honest, I did it because I was jealous..."
00:32:37.664,00:32:39.207,Not jealous of Laoghaire...
00:32:40.166,00:32:41.877,Jealous of their intimacy.
00:32:43.587,00:32:45.297,I missed my husband.
00:32:49.050,00:32:50.677,DOUGAL: Mistress Beauchamp.
00:32:51.553,00:32:55.432,"Mistress Beauchamp, are you all right?"
00:32:55.474,00:32:56.934,"Yes, I'm fine."
00:32:56.975,00:32:58.977,Thank you.
00:32:59.018,00:33:00.729,"What can I do for you, Mr. Mackenzie?"
00:33:02.522,00:33:08.987,"I thought you might like to visit Geillis Duncan, the fiscal's wife, to restock yer shelves before the gathering."
00:33:12.532,00:33:15.076,Yes.
00:33:15.118,00:33:17.203,I'm going into the village tomorrow morning.
00:33:17.245,00:33:18.997,I'll take you with me to mistress Duncan's.
00:33:45.148,00:33:49.068,GEILLIS: I'd say you need to lay in a goodly amount of white willow bark.
00:33:50.403,00:33:51.697,Eases a whiskey headache.
00:33:55.158,00:33:59.538,"So is this your doing, my sudden but very welcome visit here?"
00:34:00.914,00:34:04.710,"As I told you, there's many things in this world we can't explain."
00:34:07.754,00:34:10.048,I heard you made a visit to the Baxters' after all.
00:34:10.089,00:34:14.093,"Yes, I got to see the delightful Father Bain at work."
00:34:14.135,00:34:15.721,What a sight that was.
00:34:15.762,00:34:16.763,Was the exorcism successful?
00:34:17.764,00:34:19.432,I don't know.
00:34:19.474,00:34:21.059,I left before it was over.
00:34:22.352,00:34:27.774,"I do know if Tammas were my child, I wouldn't leave him to the tender mercies of that man."
00:34:27.816,00:34:29.568,"Steer well clear of him, Claire."
00:34:29.609,00:34:32.070,There's no mercy in his Bible or his heart.
00:34:33.321,00:34:41.955,He takes the view that every woman since eve is a born temptress who should be beaten daily by her husband to keep evil at bay.
00:34:47.210,00:34:49.838,Sometimes I feel very much the stranger in a strange land.
00:34:50.630,00:34:52.716,It can't be easy...
00:34:54.217,00:34:56.053,Being a Sassenach in the highlands...
00:34:58.972,00:35:00.599,Assuming that's what you mean.
00:35:03.435,00:35:05.103,What on Earth is going on down there?
00:35:09.482,00:35:10.609,GEILLIS: Huh.
00:35:26.541,00:35:28.126,"Lad was caught stealing, most like..."
00:35:29.586,00:35:31.170,Usually is with the tanner's lads.
00:35:32.338,00:35:35.216,They've brought him to Arthur to dispense justice.
00:35:37.636,00:35:43.308,"If his breakfast had agreed with him this morning, lad might have got off with a whipping."
00:35:43.349,00:35:50.356,"But since he's most likely costive or flatulent, the lad will probably lose his hand."
00:35:51.566,00:35:52.567,For stealing?
00:35:53.986,00:35:55.528,That's appalling.
00:36:02.869,00:36:05.163,"I need some peppermint, my dearest."
00:36:08.291,00:36:12.170,I canna render judgment with a roiling gut.
00:36:12.462,00:36:13.546,Ow.
00:36:15.256,00:36:17.717,So you haven't decided the fate of the boy yet?
00:36:18.468,00:36:21.220,Huh? Eh?
00:36:21.262,00:36:23.932,This is Claire Beauchamp from up at the castle.
00:36:25.809,00:36:27.102,"Oh, yes."
00:36:28.020,00:36:29.146,"Yes, of course."
00:36:30.897,00:36:33.025,"Ah, thank you, my darling."
00:36:33.733,00:36:34.776,Ah.
00:36:42.200,00:36:44.410,"Oh, I believe it's working already."
00:36:44.452,00:36:46.245,"Ah, ah..."
00:36:48.999,00:36:51.250,"I don't know what evidence there is against the boy, but surely..."
00:36:51.292,00:36:52.669,"He's confessed, actually."
00:36:53.962,00:36:57.382,Stole two bannocks from his employer.
00:36:57.423,00:37:01.053,Father Bain is arguing for taking his hand.
00:37:01.094,00:37:03.847,Says it's the only way to save his immortal soul.
00:37:03.889,00:37:05.390,But he's just a child.
00:37:05.431,00:37:08.685,Surely you're not going to mutilate him just for stealing a loaf of bread.
00:37:09.435,00:37:11.229,"Oh, oh, away."
00:37:15.316,00:37:16.317,Arthur...
00:37:20.405,00:37:21.447,Imagine...
00:37:22.615,00:37:33.501,"If our own union had been blessed, then how would you feel if your son were taken so?"
00:37:34.252,00:37:35.879,ARTHUR: Oh.
00:37:35.921,00:37:39.257,Surely it was but hunger that made the lad take to thievery.
00:37:39.799,00:37:40.884,Aye.
00:37:41.927,00:37:43.178,Aye.
00:37:43.220,00:37:45.263,Can you not find it in your heart...
00:37:47.515,00:37:51.644,"...to be merciful, and you the soul of justice?"
00:37:51.686,00:37:55.565,"Oh, my sweet, tender heart."
00:37:57.442,00:38:08.828,"Since he's confessed, I canna let him go, but perhaps one hour in the pillory and one ear nailed."
00:38:10.038,00:38:11.081,Uh-huh?
00:38:22.968,00:38:24.219,Oh!
00:38:26.012,00:38:29.515,"I've reached a decision, Father Bain."
00:38:30.308,00:38:31.851,We seek only justice.
00:38:33.061,00:38:34.104,There.
00:38:34.687,00:38:36.689,Easily done.
00:38:36.731,00:38:38.900,The man has no notion of guile.
00:38:42.112,00:38:44.322,"What does that mean, one ear nailed?"
00:38:46.866,00:38:48.285,Nailed to what?
00:38:49.619,00:38:51.079,"To the pillory, of course."
00:38:56.751,00:38:58.211,Better than losing a hand.
00:39:29.993,00:39:31.619,FATHER BAIN: Now you'll be absolved.
00:39:40.337,00:39:43.173,Let's get these herbs pounded and put them on to steep.
00:39:45.300,00:39:52.682,Then we can go downstairs and have a nice glass of port and tell each other all our secrets.
00:40:09.115,00:40:11.826,"GEILLIS: You do puzzle me, Claire."
00:40:11.868,00:40:15.914,One would think you don't have pillories or punishment where you come from.
00:40:19.417,00:40:20.418,It's different there.
00:40:22.670,00:40:25.548,"Where, Oxfordshire?"
00:40:26.925,00:40:28.760,Wouldn't think things were so different.
00:40:30.220,00:40:31.470,It's not just Oxfordshire.
00:40:32.555,00:40:34.391,I had an unusual childhood.
00:40:34.432,00:40:35.683,I was brought up in lots of places.
00:40:36.142,00:40:37.394,Really?
00:40:38.395,00:40:39.437,Do tell.
00:40:41.356,00:40:42.774,Fascinated to hear all about it.
00:40:50.531,00:40:51.449,What is it?
00:40:52.742,00:40:53.785,In here.
00:40:55.203,00:40:56.371,Mistress Duncan.
00:40:57.289,00:40:58.290,Mistress Beauchamp.
00:40:59.832,00:41:01.500,Mr. Mactavish.
00:41:01.542,00:41:03.628,Dougal was called back to Leoch.
00:41:03.669,00:41:05.088,I'm sent to fetch ye.
00:41:05.130,00:41:06.464,Brought your cloak to keep you warm.
00:41:07.673,00:41:11.177,Mistress Beauchamp was just about to tell me of her unusual upbringing.
00:41:12.178,00:41:13.972,I'm sure it's a good story.
00:41:14.013,00:41:16.474,Why don't you have a glass of port and listen in?
00:41:20.353,00:41:25.317,"More time, I would, but we should leave, or we'll get naught but scraps for our dinner."
00:41:25.358,00:41:28.903,"Thank you for your hospitality, Geillis, and for these."
00:41:32.157,00:41:33.491,We must do it again.
00:41:34.033,00:41:35.160,Of course.
00:41:36.786,00:41:37.829,Soon.
00:41:50.716,00:41:53.345,How much longer do you think he'll have to stay there?
00:41:53.386,00:41:54.971,He can leave anytime he wants.
00:41:55.013,00:41:56.597,His hour is done.
00:41:56.639,00:41:59.809,It's just the lad's not got up the courage to tear his ear from the nail.
00:42:01.019,00:42:02.479,You mean he has to tear himself loose?
00:42:02.770,00:42:04.230,Aye.
00:42:04.272,00:42:08.193,"He's still a bit nervous, but he'll set his mind to it soon enough."
00:42:11.363,00:42:15.992,"Mr. Mactavish, your fingers, they're quite strong, I suppose."
00:42:18.828,00:42:19.745,Aye.
00:42:26.919,00:42:30.882,"Now then, novelli, got yourself in a right swivet, have you no?"
00:42:34.135,00:42:36.388,Yon's no job to be making heavy weather of.
00:42:38.515,00:42:39.932,"A wee jouk of the head, and it's over."
00:42:43.644,00:42:45.480,"Here, shall I help you?"
00:42:48.816,00:42:49.734,Ah!
00:42:54.489,00:42:55.573,Away home.
00:43:13.299,00:43:15.301,Thank you.
00:43:17.011,00:43:20.515,"You wouldn't expect me to be less bold than a wee Sassenach lassie, now, would you?"
00:43:22.559,00:43:24.602,Would you be willing to risk helping me again?
00:43:26.104,00:43:27.480,Do you know the Black Kirk?
00:43:38.950,00:43:40.243,It's so peaceful.
00:43:41.619,00:43:43.079,It's not at all what I expected.
00:43:44.414,00:43:47.166,"Well, they say Satan's clever."
00:43:48.793,00:43:53.548,He'd hardly catch many unsuspecting souls if he laid his traps in bogs and tunnels.
00:43:55.341,00:43:57.343,Do you actually believe demons live in this place?
00:43:57.885,00:43:59.345,Hmm.
00:43:59.387,00:44:05.143,"Well, I know wee Lindsay and Tammas are not the first boys to sicken or die after a visit up here."
00:44:07.103,00:44:13.651,"To tell the truth, visiting the Black Kirk and living to tell the tale is a way to prove your manhood."
00:44:14.944,00:44:23.953,"Did it myself, when I was a lad with no harm done, but my own cousin fell under the spell and was sick near a week."
00:44:23.995,00:44:25.663,You think demons were responsible?
00:44:27.624,00:44:31.294,"I'm an educated man, mistress, if I may be so bold."
00:44:33.588,00:44:44.265,"Maybe not as educated as you, but I had a tutor, a good one."
00:44:44.307,00:44:54.651,"He taught me Latin and Greek and such, not childhood stories of fairies, devils, waterhorses in lochs."
00:44:56.986,00:45:05.744,"But I am also a highlander, born and bred, and I dinna believe in tempting fate by making light of old nick in his very own kirkyard."
00:45:09.457,00:45:15.296,"So when you would come here as a boy to prove your manhood, what exactly would you do?"
00:45:15.921,00:45:17.006,Not much.
00:45:18.341,00:45:20.677,"Caper about, mostly."
00:45:20.717,00:45:22.845,Climb the walls.
00:45:22.887,00:45:25.682,Maybe defy the devil by pissing on the stones.
00:45:25.722,00:45:29.726,You might be lucky and find some berries or wood garlic to eat.
00:45:30.144,00:45:32.104,Wood garlic?
00:45:32.146,00:45:33.814,And you'd eat it?
00:45:34.691,00:45:35.732,Can you show me?
00:45:37.527,00:45:40.737,"JAMIE: Oh, I didn't like the taste of it, but some folks find it a treat."
00:45:41.406,00:45:43.491,This isn't wood garlic.
00:45:43.533,00:45:45.742,"It's Convallaria majalis, Lily of the valley."
00:45:47.203,00:45:48.329,Lily of the valley?
00:45:49.497,00:45:51.666,Huh.
00:45:51.708,00:45:53.543,That's because it's not native to Scotland.
00:45:56.462,00:46:00.174,"The monks that built this place, were they from Germany by chance?"
00:46:02.927,00:46:03.760,Germany?
00:46:05.555,00:46:06.763,"Prussia, I mean."
00:46:08.224,00:46:09.350,Aye.
00:46:11.185,00:46:12.353,Of course.
00:46:25.824,00:46:29.370,"MRS. FITZ: Mistress, the poor bairn is nearly gone."
00:46:31.956,00:46:33.999,Satan has claimed his body.
00:46:34.041,00:46:37.002,Father Bain can only hope to save his immortal soul.
00:46:37.044,00:46:38.963,I think I can save his life.
00:46:39.004,00:46:41.924,I think Lindsay and Tammas ate this.
00:46:41.966,00:46:45.052,"This is Lily of the valley, but it looks exactly the same as wood garlic..."
00:46:45.094,00:46:46.929,But this is poisonous.
00:46:46.971,00:46:50.391,"I can give Tammas something to counteract the poison, but we have to move quickly."
00:46:50.433,00:46:51.434,What blasphemy is this?
00:46:52.518,00:46:53.978,"Father, I mean no blasphemy."
00:46:54.019,00:46:56.230,I simply...
00:46:57.940,00:47:00.401,You are not ordained to drive away the demon.
00:47:00.443,00:47:02.320,"Now, leave this house this instant."
00:47:02.361,00:47:05.948,"The boy's problem is poison, not a demon."
00:47:05.990,00:47:07.908,"And if you don't let me tend to him, he will die."
00:47:07.950,00:47:08.993,"Let her pass, father."
00:47:14.749,00:47:21.172,This boy is a slave to Satan and must be purged or have his soul doomed to eternal damnation.
00:47:24.676,00:47:37.854,"This is my sister's house, and my father's before that, and we'll decide what is done under its roof."
00:47:45.070,00:47:45.904,Tend to the boy.
00:47:48.825,00:47:50.951,I smell the vapors of hell on you.
00:47:59.752,00:48:01.128,It's a decoction of belladonna.
00:48:05.800,00:48:13.349,"CLAIRE: If the decoction worked, it would normalize his heart rate, lower his blood pressure, and bring him back to consciousness within moments."
00:48:13.391,00:48:21.482,"If I was wrong about the dosage or the original poison, it would cause convulsions and kill the boy almost as quickly."
00:48:42.169,00:48:42.961,Tammas.
00:48:46.799,00:48:48.133,Ma.
00:48:48.175,00:48:50.386,"Oh, my boy!"
00:48:50.428,00:48:53.055,"Oh, he's come back to me."
00:48:53.097,00:48:54.557,"It's a miracle, Father."
00:48:54.599,00:48:57.560,"God bless you, mistress."
00:49:07.403,00:49:12.116,"Satan may like to make a fool of God, but God will have the last word."
00:49:17.538,00:49:18.623,I promise you that.
00:49:25.003,00:49:28.257,I truly believe Father Bain would have preferred that boy die than me save him.
00:49:29.174,00:49:30.426,Aye.
00:49:30.468,00:49:32.344,I don't doubt that.
00:49:32.386,00:49:37.974,"A man's beliefs are how he makes sense of life, and if you take that away, what do you have left?"
00:49:40.102,00:49:41.186,Is it so different where you come from?
00:49:43.355,00:49:44.857,"In that regard, I suppose not."
00:49:49.278,00:49:52.782,"Well, if it makes you feel better, Mrs. Fitz now calls you..."
00:49:55.534,00:49:56.828,The miracle worker.
00:49:56.869,00:49:58.995,Good lord.
00:50:00.748,00:50:05.419,"At the very least, I hope I've earned a measure of trust from Colum."
00:50:06.002,00:50:07.003,Aye.
00:50:10.299,00:50:14.762,He's taking credit for bringing you on as healer to the Mackenzies.
00:50:14.804,00:50:16.639,I doubt he'll want to see you leave anytime soon.
00:50:22.603,00:50:24.020,I'll never get out of here.
00:50:29.067,00:50:30.528,CLAIRE: I almost stayed in my room.
00:50:31.821,00:50:36.492,I had no desire to see that mixture of awe and suspicion that seemed to follow me everywhere now.
00:50:39.077,00:50:44.375,It only heightened the feeling of hopelessness about my situation that had come crashing down on me.
00:50:46.752,00:50:55.427,"I had performed what has been called a miracle, but instead of buying me my release, it had tightened my bonds to this place."
00:50:55.469,00:51:03.477,"And even if I did get away, get back to the stones, I had no guarantee it would work again, whatever it was."
00:51:04.395,00:51:09.441,"And if it did work, there was no guarantee that I would get back home."
00:51:09.483,00:51:15.447,Couldn't I just as easily be hurtled back in time yet again to the Middle Ages or even the Roman Occupation?
00:51:17.115,00:51:22.120,What finally brought me out of my room was the oblivion promised by Colum's Rhenish.
00:51:24.707,00:51:27.752,Over here.
00:51:31.338,00:51:34.508,"Stay low and quiet, or they're likely to stone us."
00:51:44.435,00:51:56.530,Now this one is about a man out late on a fairy hill on the eve of Samhain who hears the sound of a woman singing sad and plaintive from the very rocks of the hill.
00:52:10.086,00:52:11.754,I am a woman of Balnain.
00:52:13.213,00:52:19.261,"The folk have stolen me over again, the stones seemed to say."
00:52:20.721,00:52:28.144,"I stood upon the hill, and wind did rise, and the sound of thunder rolled across the land."
00:52:32.274,00:52:45.287,"I placed my hands upon the tallest stone and traveled to a far, distant land where I lived for a time among strangers who became lovers and friends."
00:52:52.003,00:52:56.841,"But one day, I saw the moon came out and the wind rose once more."
00:52:58.383,00:53:08.184,So I touched the stones and traveled back to my own land and took up again with the man I had left behind.
00:53:10.437,00:53:12.106,She came back through the stones?
00:53:14.692,00:53:16.110,"Aye, she did."
00:53:17.653,00:53:19.947,They always do.
00:53:19.989,00:53:28.580,"CLAIRE: It was a folktale, madness to take as fact, and yet half of what Gwyllyn had described had actually happened to me."
00:53:32.877,00:53:38.214,"Why not the other half, the part where the woman returned home?"
00:53:42.887,00:53:44.096,What had Geillis said?
00:53:44.638,00:53:48.600,"As I told you, there's many things in this world we can't explain."
00:53:50.019,00:53:57.068,"CLAIRE: My heart suddenly lightened, and I knew in that moment I could no longer wait for permission or assistance."
00:53:58.027,00:54:05.241,I must escape Castle Leoch and get back to the stones as soon as possible or die trying.
00:00:01.376,00:00:02.753,CLAIRE: Previously...
00:00:02.795,00:00:04.964,We were in Scotland on our second honeymoon.
00:00:06.924,00:00:09.844,"I wanted it to be a dream, but I knew it wasn't."
00:00:09.885,00:00:11.720,I'd seemed to have fallen through time.
00:00:11.762,00:00:15.641,DOUGAL: Seems that the feral cat we picked up on the road is trying to pull in her claws.
00:00:15.683,00:00:18.018,Colum's taking credit for bringing you on as healer to the MacKenzies.
00:00:18.059,00:00:19.854,DOUGAL: I doubt he'll want to see you leave any time soon.
00:00:19.895,00:00:22.523,I sent Jamie to the stables to help Old Alec with the horses.
00:00:22.564,00:00:24.525,Best place for him under the circumstances.
00:00:24.566,00:00:26.067,Dinna want him inside the walls.
00:00:26.109,00:00:27.778,"Jamie needs a woman, not a lassie."
00:00:27.820,00:00:30.155,And Laoghaire will be a lassie until she's 50.
00:00:30.197,00:00:33.701,Mistress Beauchamp was just about to tell me of her unusual upbringing.
00:00:33.742,00:00:35.160,I'm sure it's a good story.
00:00:35.202,00:00:36.787,CLAIRE: She came back through the stones.
00:00:36.829,00:00:38.497,"Aye, she did."
00:00:38.539,00:00:44.085,CLAIRE: I must escape Castle Leoch on my own and get back to the stones as soon as possible...
00:00:44.127,00:00:45.713,...or die trying.
00:02:59.805,00:03:01.140,Gah! Tonight we feast!
00:03:01.180,00:03:02.390,BOY: And eat like kings!
00:03:02.432,00:03:04.183,You won't make a meal of me yet!
00:03:04.225,00:03:05.226,The beast is getting away!
00:03:14.235,00:03:16.071,"Something catch your eye there, lassie?"
00:03:16.113,00:03:18.699,something I'm not likely to forget in a hurry.
00:03:24.746,00:03:26.790,Mistress Claire.
00:03:26.832,00:03:28.375,You've lost your fichu.
00:03:28.416,00:03:30.169,BOY 2: And you lost your hair ribbon yesterday.
00:03:30.209,00:03:31.837,So I have.
00:03:31.879,00:03:35.132,"I was so concentrated on escaping you, I didn't even notice."
00:03:35.174,00:03:36.216,"Are you done with your game, lass?"
00:03:40.470,00:03:42.597,The MacKenzie didn't say you could waste the whole day out here.
00:03:44.933,00:03:46.476,"Well, who says we're done yet?"
00:03:46.518,00:03:48.854,There's still lots more to explore.
00:03:48.896,00:03:50.564,"You were right, mistress."
00:03:50.605,00:03:54.068,This part of the woods is much better than the courtyard or the other side of the castle.
00:03:54.109,00:03:55.736,Can I be the boar this time?
00:03:55.777,00:03:57.278,I don't see why not.
00:03:57.320,00:03:58.488,All right. To the hunt!
00:03:59.781,00:04:00.615,Mistress Beauchamp!
00:04:03.160,00:04:05.913,We're missing the festivities.
00:04:05.954,00:04:08.248,It's nae since I was a bairn we've had a gathering at Leoch.
00:04:09.958,00:04:11.459,All right.
00:04:11.501,00:04:13.754,Shall we let these men get to their festivities?
00:04:13.795,00:04:15.172,Come on.
00:04:15.214,00:04:16.715,We can play again tomorrow.
00:04:16.757,00:04:18.050,Of course.
00:04:20.468,00:04:22.179,All right. Shall we?
00:04:30.771,00:04:33.440,The hunting game was more than a pleasant diversion.
00:04:33.481,00:04:37.402,It allowed me to reconnoiter the terrain around the castle without suspicion.
00:04:37.444,00:04:43.283,"So far I had found at least two possible escape routes, and left breadcrumbs to mark my way to freedom."
00:05:15.565,00:05:18.026,"Doubt ye've ever seen anything as braw as this where yer from, eh?"
00:05:18.068,00:05:19.319,No.
00:05:22.739,00:05:31.832,"The victory day celebrations in London and Paris far exceeded the gathering of the MacKenzie clan in terms of sheer size, but this was something different..."
00:05:37.796,00:05:40.590,The MacKenzies were simply glad to see one another.
00:05:42.425,00:05:50.349,"Despite my eagerness to leave, my heart lifted whenever I walked through the encampment and a small part of me regretted my imminent escape."
00:05:52.602,00:05:55.438,I had the entire route mapped out in my head.
00:05:55.480,00:06:00.777,"At night, both windows would be lighted by torch, beacons to guide me to the breaches in the sentry posts."
00:06:00.819,00:06:04.948,But I still needed to find distractions for my ever-present shadows.
00:06:14.166,00:06:20.255,"Gentlemen, please do not look, but that woman stirring the bowl over there seems to fancy one of you."
00:06:22.341,00:06:23.466,I said don't look.
00:06:24.425,00:06:26.136,"Oh, aye."
00:06:26.178,00:06:29.097,"She's a pie-eater, that one."
00:06:29.139,00:06:32.226,"Well, I'll just be settling my cock to roost in that tonight."
00:06:32.267,00:06:34.061,Not so fast.
00:06:34.102,00:06:36.146,We said everra man for himself during the gathering.
00:06:36.688,00:06:37.981,"Aye, we did."
00:06:38.023,00:06:40.108,But ye ken how much I fancy a hen with a bit of meat.
00:06:40.150,00:06:41.276,Who doesn't?
00:06:41.318,00:06:43.570,I may be of some assistance.
00:06:43.611,00:06:45.697,I realize I'm a captive audience of sorts.
00:06:45.739,00:06:48.075,But I'd rather not be subjected to another one of your inane debates.
00:06:48.116,00:06:50.744,"So if you please, pull sticks?"
00:06:53.080,00:06:55.414,Either one?
00:06:58.001,00:07:00.419,Right. Choose.
00:07:03.631,00:07:05.717,'Tis all yer wanking gives ye that much speed of hand.
00:07:11.306,00:07:14.434,"I'll save some pie for ye, hmm?"
00:07:17.562,00:07:20.107,I'll need to pick a horse for the hunt tomorrow.
00:07:20.148,00:07:21.942,The lad wants a healer to go along just in case.
00:07:21.983,00:07:23.568,Oh.
00:07:38.792,00:07:43.088,Uncle Lamb had taught me to ride during the years we lived in Ireland.
00:07:43.130,00:07:46.883,"But that was a long time ago, and I needed to pick a gentle, easy horse."
00:07:48.176,00:07:50.053,Mistress.
00:07:50.095,00:07:52.139,There's no one in need of healing here.
00:07:52.180,00:07:55.225,I was told I would be needed for the hunt tomorrow.
00:07:55.267,00:07:57.227,"She'll be wanting a horse, then."
00:07:57.269,00:07:59.313,"I suppose, yes, if I mean to keep up."
00:07:59.354,00:08:00.897,Most of the horses have been spoken for.
00:08:02.899,00:08:04.567,I don't want to be of any trouble.
00:08:04.609,00:08:06.111,Perhaps Mr. MacTavish can help me.
00:08:06.153,00:08:07.404,Lad's no here.
00:08:09.281,00:08:11.491,"Best to leave Jamie to his own thoughts today, lass."
00:08:12.867,00:08:14.411,I didn't know I was a bother to him.
00:08:14.453,00:08:15.912,I dinna ken if yer a bother or no.
00:08:17.038,00:08:18.623,That's for the lad to judge.
00:08:18.665,00:08:22.502,I'm just saying it's best for all concerned if young Jamie is left to himself while the gathering's on.
00:08:29.301,00:08:30.677,'Tis brimstone.
00:08:30.718,00:08:32.137,I'm sure she'll be all right for yer needs.
00:08:32.179,00:08:33.554,Brimstone.
00:08:33.596,00:08:35.474,Sounds ominous.
00:08:35.515,00:08:37.767,'Tis like calling a tall man wee.
00:08:37.809,00:08:40.770,"She's no fast, but she's sweet and can go for days."
00:08:40.812,00:08:45.066,"Only thing is if yer not minding her every moment, she'll turn for home first chance she gets."
00:08:46.526,00:08:48.195,I'll leave you two to get acquainted.
00:08:51.906,00:08:56.370,"There would be no turning for home, not if I had anything to say about it."
00:09:12.927,00:09:14.388,Brought the port ye asked for.
00:09:14.429,00:09:15.680,"Christ, Geillis."
00:09:15.722,00:09:17.682,Mrs. Fitz told me I might find you down here.
00:09:19.476,00:09:21.436,Hope I'm not disturbing ye.
00:09:21.478,00:09:22.812,"No, of course not."
00:09:22.854,00:09:25.940,I... I was elsewhere.
00:09:25.982,00:09:27.442,Thank you.
00:09:27.484,00:09:28.943,I hope it wasn't too much trouble.
00:09:28.985,00:09:30.570,No trouble.
00:09:30.611,00:09:32.197,We have plenty collecting dust.
00:09:34.491,00:09:37.077,Something in port makes my husband fart like an ox.
00:09:37.994,00:09:39.287,Claire.
00:09:41.122,00:09:42.290,"Are you with bairn, then?"
00:09:43.791,00:09:45.085,Pardon me?
00:09:45.126,00:09:46.627,Ye've quite a stock of food here.
00:09:48.046,00:09:50.382,Are ye eating for two?
00:09:50.424,00:09:54.761,Do you think that's simply because I have a store here rather than trudging back and forth to the kitchen?
00:09:56.888,00:09:59.599,Perhaps that's why you're desperate to get to France?
00:10:01.142,00:10:04.271,An illegitimate pregnancy?
00:10:04.312,00:10:08.149,I can assure you I've never been unfaithful to my husband.
00:10:08.191,00:10:09.943,It's not unfaithful if he's dead.
00:10:14.906,00:10:16.032,Is he?
00:10:23.248,00:10:24.541,He's not alive.
00:10:27.001,00:10:28.295,So he's...
00:10:29.879,00:10:31.005,"...dead, then."
00:10:40.098,00:10:41.516,He's dead.
00:10:48.982,00:10:51.025,No. We never had children.
00:10:51.901,00:10:53.236,We tried.
00:10:55.113,00:10:56.364,Maybe you're barren.
00:10:59.409,00:11:00.660,"Well, it doesn't matter now."
00:11:03.455,00:11:05.206,See ye have trouble sleeping as well.
00:11:07.208,00:11:08.502,Valerian root. Hmm.
00:11:09.461,00:11:11.379,I have trouble sleeping too.
00:11:11.421,00:11:13.214,But I don't mash my valerian like that.
00:11:14.549,00:11:16.801,I boil it whole first.
00:11:16.843,00:11:19.262,I was wondering about the proper dosage.
00:11:19.304,00:11:20.930,How much do you take?
00:11:20.972,00:11:23.099,It's not for me.
00:11:23.141,00:11:25.602,Put it in Arthur's evening tea.
00:11:25.644,00:11:27.686,Then I sleep like a newborn.
00:11:28.813,00:11:30.440,"Careful, though."
00:11:30.482,00:11:33.067,Ye have enough there to put a whole army to sleep till the next moon.
00:11:33.568,00:11:35.403,Thank you.
00:11:35.445,00:11:36.571,I'll boil it in the future.
00:11:39.115,00:11:44.412,"When I first came to Cranesmuir, all I had was my wits, ye ken?"
00:11:46.039,00:11:49.376,I had a fairish knowledge of the plants and their good uses.
00:11:50.751,00:11:53.712,I found a man with a respectable position.
00:11:53.754,00:11:56.591,Decent house.
00:11:56.633,00:11:59.760,"I know he's not much to look at, as ye well ken."
00:12:01.262,00:12:02.721,But that doesn't trouble me much.
00:12:03.848,00:12:05.099,I'm free.
00:12:05.141,00:12:06.725,Can do whatever I please.
00:12:10.063,00:12:12.731,You seem to have built quite the comfortable life for yourself.
00:12:13.900,00:12:15.527,Hmm.
00:12:15.569,00:12:18.572,Sometimes ye find yerself on a path you never expected.
00:12:20.240,00:12:22.741,Doesn't mean it can't lead you to a bonny place.
00:12:26.120,00:12:31.125,"I'd love to stay and chat, Geillis, but I still have so much to do and prepare for the hunt."
00:12:31.167,00:12:32.586,"Oh, the hunt."
00:12:34.753,00:12:36.755,That must be what yer preparing for.
00:12:38.883,00:12:40.134,Of course.
00:12:45.056,00:12:47.766,The highlands are no place for a woman to be alone.
00:12:49.768,00:12:51.229,You'd do well to remember that.
00:12:53.273,00:12:54.649,See you later at the oath-taking?
00:12:56.568,00:12:57.776,Are ye sure?
00:12:59.112,00:13:00.447,Promise.
00:13:01.531,00:13:03.866,Careful.
00:13:03.908,00:13:05.784,Promise is a serious thing in this country.
00:13:08.371,00:13:09.788,"Mine, too."
00:13:30.184,00:13:36.023,"Later tonight, all the fighting men of the MacKenzie clan would gather in the hall and make their oaths of allegiance to Colum."
00:13:36.065,00:13:38.276,No one would be watching the stables.
00:13:46.451,00:13:48.119,I was almost ready.
00:14:05.804,00:14:10.391,Tonight would be my one and only chance to escape Leoch and return to Craigh na Dun.
00:14:36.042,00:14:38.378,I knew how I might dodge my shadows.
00:14:38.419,00:14:41.881,I had my mount and my provisions.
00:14:41.922,00:14:44.467,"Now all I lacked was a weapon, should I need it."
00:14:47.470,00:14:48.680,MRS. FITZ: Claire.
00:14:50.139,00:14:52.809,"Yer no wearing that to the ceremony, are ye, lass?"
00:14:55.353,00:14:58.981,I assumed a Sassenach wouldn't be welcome at such an important event.
00:14:59.023,00:15:00.650,Don't be silly.
00:15:00.692,00:15:02.819,Yer Colum's personal guest.
00:15:04.529,00:15:05.946,I'm not dressed for the occasion.
00:15:05.988,00:15:08.366,"Oh, we'll see to that straightaway."
00:15:11.536,00:15:14.414,I'd hate to put you out.
00:15:33.057,00:15:34.768,We'd better hurry now.
00:15:34.809,00:15:37.645,The beginning of the oath-taking is the best part.
00:15:37.687,00:15:40.481,How do I look?
00:15:40.523,00:15:50.909,"At first I thought Mrs. Fitz's intervention would disrupt my plans, but then I realized that with her at my side as a proper escort, my shadows would be less vigilant as I moved through the castle."
00:15:50.950,00:15:56.873,"I needed them to relax, to let down their guard and enjoy the festivities if I was to distract them later."
00:15:56.915,00:15:59.417,Glenna.
00:15:59.459,00:16:02.754,I see you have the place looking bright as a new pin.
00:16:02.796,00:16:05.298,"Oh, that lovely dress again."
00:16:05.339,00:16:06.966,Ye wore it so well to the last gathering.
00:16:07.884,00:16:09.385,Murtagh.
00:17:46.983,00:17:48.860,The MacKenzie's welcoming the men to Leoch.
00:17:49.986,00:17:51.445,He hopes they had easy journeys.
00:17:51.487,00:17:52.906,Shh!
00:17:56.325,00:18:02.164,"Also hopes that never a day will come when the clan's fighting men will have to draw iron, but if they do..."
00:18:05.793,00:18:07.921,ALL: Aye!
00:18:07.962,00:18:12.800,He couldn't hope for a better lot than stands before him today to defend the clan's honor.
00:18:21.601,00:18:25.688,"It is a right daft soul that would challenge the MacKenzies, weapons or no."
00:19:11.233,00:19:24.371,"I swear, by the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the holy iron that I hold, to give ye my fealty and to pledge ye my loyalty to the name of clan MacKenzie."
00:19:24.413,00:19:32.088,"And if ever I shall raise my hand against ye in rebellion, I ask that this holy iron shall pierce my heart."
00:20:49.456,00:20:59.759,"I swear by the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the holy iron that I hold, to give ye my fealty and pledge ye my loyalty."
00:20:59.800,00:21:01.260,"Are they all the same, the oaths?"
00:21:01.886,00:21:03.012,Aye.
00:21:04.638,00:21:05.932,"Oh, well."
00:21:05.973,00:21:08.142,"If you've seen one, then."
00:21:08.184,00:21:10.895,...that this holy iron shall pierce my heart.
00:21:24.283,00:21:26.285,Congratulations.
00:21:26.326,00:21:28.370,Interesting ceremony.
00:21:28.412,00:21:31.040,But I've seen enough.
00:21:31.082,00:21:33.084,No. Whoa.
00:21:33.918,00:21:35.586,Back to the surgery.
00:21:35.628,00:21:37.922,I have to prepare the supplies for the hunt tomorrow.
00:21:37.964,00:21:40.007,"Dedicated, are ye, now?"
00:21:40.049,00:21:50.101,"Well, I dinna ken how ye celebrate in Oxfordshire, or wherever it is ye cry home, but I'm not missing the gathering, biding with ye down in yer hole."
00:21:50.143,00:21:51.894,"Suit yourself, but I'm going."
00:21:51.936,00:21:53.938,"Well, Dougal's standing orders are to stay with ye."
00:21:53.980,00:21:55.355,Mistress.
00:21:57.066,00:21:59.193,Can ye see fit to stay?
00:21:59.235,00:22:01.154,At least...
00:22:01.195,00:22:02.947,Until I bag a lass for the evening?
00:22:06.826,00:22:08.077,If I must.
00:22:08.119,00:22:09.495,May as well join in.
00:22:12.290,00:22:15.334,"Now, that's more in the spirit."
00:22:16.585,00:22:17.503,Hmm?
00:22:34.979,00:22:36.022,That's not rhenish.
00:22:36.063,00:22:37.606,Mmm. It's port.
00:22:38.356,00:22:39.357,Very expensive.
00:22:42.028,00:22:43.361,Port.
00:22:46.032,00:22:47.533,'Tis very strong.
00:22:51.369,00:22:53.706,I canna seem to keep my legs.
00:22:55.082,00:22:56.374,It's a sedative.
00:22:57.459,00:22:58.627,Is that Spanish?
00:22:59.920,00:23:01.964,Go. Don't let me keep you.
00:23:02.006,00:23:03.757,Some lucky lady awaits.
00:23:04.800,00:23:06.260,Take the wine.
00:23:06.302,00:23:07.970,Share it with all your friends.
00:23:17.521,00:23:21.525,"The more unconscious clansmen tonight, the better."
00:23:21.567,00:23:23.443,Ooh! Ye rascals!
00:23:51.722,00:23:54.183,you startled me.
00:23:54.225,00:23:55.726,"I'm sorry, Mistress Beauchamp."
00:23:55.768,00:23:56.810,It's Claire.
00:24:01.690,00:24:03.234,"Oh, aye, um..."
00:24:03.276,00:24:05.319,If... If I can trouble ye for a wee favor?
00:24:05.361,00:24:06.779,"You're not injured, are you?"
00:24:06.820,00:24:08.030,"No, no, I'm braw."
00:24:08.072,00:24:09.198,Um...
00:24:10.241,00:24:12.450,"Well, I was wondering if..."
00:24:14.703,00:24:19.792,...you had a potion that might open a lad's heart to a lassie.
00:24:21.501,00:24:23.170,I'm not sure I know what you mean.
00:24:23.212,00:24:29.135,"Ye ken, a potion, or maybe a brew of some kind that would help a lad..."
00:24:29.760,00:24:31.220,A love potion?
00:24:31.262,00:24:33.180,"Oh, no, I dinna mean to offend ye, Mistress."
00:24:33.222,00:24:35.266,I just had it in mind that...
00:24:35.308,00:24:42.856,"Well, ye aid so many with your healing that maybe ye have something in yer keen knowledge that could help a lass hold a lad's attention."
00:24:44.984,00:24:46.026,Mr. MacTavish?
00:24:48.612,00:24:51.991,"Well, you didn't appear to need much assistance the last time I saw you two together."
00:24:52.032,00:24:53.533,"Well, not for that."
00:24:54.660,00:24:56.494,It's for moving his heart forward.
00:25:00.333,00:25:01.541,Wait there.
00:25:15.181,00:25:16.932,Dried horse dung.
00:25:16.974,00:25:18.434,Harmless if a bit pungent.
00:25:19.643,00:25:21.645,Jamie would never know the difference.
00:25:21.687,00:25:22.729,Perfect.
00:25:38.912,00:25:40.331,Here.
00:25:40.373,00:25:43.042,Sprinkle the contents of this at his threshold.
00:25:43.083,00:25:50.548,"Stand outside the door, tap your heels together three times, and recite, There's no place like love, there's no place like love."
00:25:51.884,00:25:53.427,Thanks to ye...
00:25:53.469,00:25:54.552,...Claire.
00:25:55.221,00:25:56.263,Good luck.
00:26:07.774,00:26:09.609,Past the storeroom on the right.
00:26:09.651,00:26:11.153,Avoid the kitchen.
00:26:11.195,00:26:14.532,"Through the east wing, then make for the north stairs."
00:26:35.844,00:26:37.304,What the devil?
00:27:01.203,00:27:02.955,Thank you.
00:27:05.583,00:27:06.875,Aye.
00:27:11.255,00:27:12.798,Ye shouldna be here.
00:27:15.968,00:27:19.721,"But since ye are, there's a penalty to pay for that."
00:27:28.063,00:27:29.398,"Get ye gone, lass."
00:27:30.648,00:27:32.192,Before ye pay a greater price.
00:28:02.306,00:28:04.933,I had to focus and forget about the incident with Dougal.
00:28:06.059,00:28:08.854,15 paces towards the well.
00:28:08.895,00:28:12.608,"Keep to the northwest to avoid the sentry, who usually faces south."
00:28:43.597,00:28:46.725,"Brimstone is on the right, fourth stall from the doorway."
00:28:50.521,00:28:52.565,Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ.
00:28:53.607,00:28:55.442,"No, Sassenach."
00:29:04.284,00:29:11.417,"How far did ye think ye'd get, lass, on a dark night with a strange horse, with half the MacKenzie clan after ye by morning?"
00:29:11.458,00:29:13.085,Won't be after me.
00:29:13.126,00:29:14.753,They're all up at the hall.
00:29:14.794,00:29:19.341,"And if one in five of them is sober enough to stand in the morning, let alone ride a horse, then I'll be most surprised."
00:29:19.383,00:29:22.261,Running away on a whim just because the men are drunk?
00:29:22.302,00:29:24.804,On a whim?
00:29:24.846,00:29:27.391,You know I've wanted to leave here for weeks.
00:29:27.433,00:29:29.976,And I know exactly how many sentry posts surround the castle.
00:29:30.018,00:29:33.230,And I know how to make my way through the forest and find the road back to Inverness.
00:29:33.272,00:29:35.815,"Well, that's a verra sound plan, Sassenach."
00:29:35.857,00:29:40.820,"Or would be, did Colum not post extra guards through the woods tonight."
00:29:40.862,00:29:44.575,"He'd hardly leave the castle undefended, and the fighting men of the clan inside it."
00:29:45.325,00:29:46.785,I'm going anyway.
00:29:48.370,00:29:49.871,The best trackers in the clan are here.
00:29:50.664,00:29:52.499,They'll catch ye.
00:29:52.541,00:29:55.043,Colum will not be calling ye a guest after that.
00:29:55.085,00:29:57.212,I don't care.
00:29:57.254,00:29:58.797,I need to leave this place.
00:29:59.506,00:30:04.261,"As you so plainly stated, I'm an outlander, just a Sassenach."
00:30:04.303,00:30:07.264,"If I offended ye, I'm sorry, Claire."
00:30:12.102,00:30:13.479,I know you didn't mean it like that.
00:30:13.520,00:30:14.813,It's just...
00:30:16.774,00:30:23.822,"I've been planning this escape for some time, and to have all my hopes shot to hell just in a moment, it's..."
00:30:32.164,00:30:33.373,Come along.
00:30:35.292,00:30:37.711,I'll take you back up to the castle.
00:30:42.966,00:30:46.052,I don't think that's a very good idea.
00:30:46.094,00:30:49.889,I had an encounter with some drunken clansmen in the corridor.
00:30:52.309,00:30:53.226,They dinna touch ye now?
00:30:55.854,00:30:57.022,I can't go back.
00:31:01.109,00:31:04.738,Dougal and I were in the corridor near the kitchen and...
00:31:04.780,00:31:11.870,"He was being forward with me, and I may have walloped him over the head with a chair or something, and I think he's unconscious."
00:31:13.497,00:31:14.707,Was he drunk?
00:31:16.542,00:31:17.710,Very.
00:31:22.464,00:31:24.758,Well...
00:31:24.800,00:31:26.510,I doubt verra much he'll remember that.
00:31:27.511,00:31:31.765,"And even if he does, I doubt he'll be in a rush to bruit that a lass got the better of him."
00:31:33.684,00:31:34.934,"Knocked him out cold, huh?"
00:31:36.895,00:31:38.938,I didn't exactly stick around to examine him.
00:31:40.691,00:31:44.444,"Well, I hope ye left a good mark so he remembers his error in judgment."
00:31:49.700,00:31:50.992,"'Tis fine, Sassenach."
00:31:54.454,00:31:55.622,Come.
00:32:05.591,00:32:08.927,CLAIRE: This isn't the way back in.
00:32:08.968,00:32:10.554,There's an opening to a hidden tunnel.
00:32:10.596,00:32:11.680,Found it playing as a bairn.
00:32:11.722,00:32:13.390,"Here, careful."
00:32:15.975,00:32:17.936,Brings us out under the cellar.
00:32:20.522,00:32:21.607,Thank you.
00:32:22.982,00:32:24.276,For seeing me back safely.
00:32:25.151,00:32:26.820,"No, lass."
00:32:26.862,00:32:30.449,"It's me that should be thanking you, for all yer healing of my scratches."
00:32:37.497,00:32:39.625,God's eyes.
00:32:39.666,00:32:43.503,"If it's not the young lad, Colum's nephew."
00:32:43.545,00:32:45.589,"Come late to the oath-taking, are ye not?"
00:32:45.631,00:32:47.340,Ye don't want to miss your turn in front of himself.
00:32:47.382,00:32:50.469,"Na, let me go and change first at the cottage."
00:32:50.510,00:32:52.011,I'm not decent going to the oath-taking like this.
00:32:52.053,00:32:53.931,"Don't worry yourself about that, laddie."
00:32:53.972,00:32:55.557,We will outfit you proper inside.
00:32:55.599,00:32:56.725,Can I keep the lassie for myself?
00:32:56.767,00:32:57.976,Let the lady go!
00:32:59.812,00:33:00.979,Are ye all right?
00:33:11.197,00:33:12.157,JAMIE: Ye dinna have to hit me so hard.
00:33:13.784,00:33:15.577,I was willing to come.
00:33:20.165,00:33:21.667,"Got the rest of yer clothes, Jamie."
00:33:24.878,00:33:29.925,"Well, that should be suitable for the laird's nephew."
00:33:31.802,00:33:33.011,You'll be needing this.
00:33:35.555,00:33:37.182,Luceo non uro.
00:33:38.224,00:33:39.977,"I shine, not burn."
00:33:40.018,00:33:42.562,"Aye, the MacKenzie motto."
00:33:46.984,00:33:48.485,I'm sorry.
00:33:48.527,00:33:50.028,Didn't mean for you to have to stand up for me.
00:33:50.069,00:33:51.112,Don't fuss yourself on my account.
00:33:53.323,00:33:54.407,How's your head?
00:33:54.449,00:33:55.617,Fine.
00:33:57.160,00:33:59.037,My sister Jenny says it's harder than an iron pot.
00:34:04.501,00:34:06.252,I canna wear this.
00:34:07.170,00:34:08.380,I'm not a MacKenzie.
00:34:09.756,00:34:11.049,"Do ye know my motto, lass?"
00:34:11.842,00:34:13.051,"My clan's, I mean?"
00:34:14.052,00:34:15.178,No.
00:34:15.220,00:34:17.305,I don't even know what clan you're from.
00:34:20.225,00:34:21.351,Je suis prest.
00:34:27.816,00:34:28.901,Find a place in the hall.
00:34:33.572,00:34:34.990,Je suis prest.
00:34:35.032,00:34:36.909,I am ready.
00:34:36.950,00:34:39.118,But ready for what?
00:34:58.555,00:35:00.098,Jamie's here.
00:35:07.522,00:35:08.565,Why is everyone so tense?
00:35:08.607,00:35:10.108,Shh!
00:35:10.149,00:35:11.735,What's going on?
00:35:11.777,00:35:13.152,Why?
00:35:16.406,00:35:21.453,"If Jamie pledges fealty to his uncle, Colum, then he'd be in line to succeed as laird."
00:35:24.247,00:35:26.249,CLAIRE: Why wouldn't Hamish become laird?
00:35:26.291,00:35:27.918,"If he's too young, then Dougal?"
00:35:27.960,00:35:29.795,That may be the way the English do things.
00:35:29.836,00:35:31.630,But clans are tanist.
00:35:32.464,00:35:34.257,Jamie has MacKenzie blood.
00:35:40.263,00:35:46.103,"If enough clansmen want Jamie to be laird, then there it would be, and a terrible thing at that."
00:35:53.443,00:35:55.320,Mr. MacTavish seems like a good choice to be laird.
00:35:56.613,00:36:01.409,"His other uncle, Dougal, might disagree with ye on that point, lass."
00:36:01.451,00:36:04.663,He's been holding the honor for himself when Colum dies.
00:36:04.704,00:36:10.043,"If Jamie takes the oath, Dougal wouldna let him breathe MacKenzie air for long."
00:36:10.085,00:36:12.545,So why doesn't he just decline to take the oath?
00:36:12.587,00:36:14.089,Not while he abides at Leoch.
00:36:14.798,00:36:19.594,"As the laird's nephew and as a healthy man at arms, he has no choice."
00:36:19.636,00:36:28.020,"If before all Jamie refuses, the maids would likely be scrubbing the lad's blood from the floor at Colum's feet."
00:36:28.061,00:36:30.147,"So no matter what he decides, he winds up dead?"
00:36:31.481,00:36:32.691,Why stay at the castle?
00:36:32.732,00:36:35.861,Why didn't he just leave if both his uncles would have his head on a pike?
00:36:35.902,00:36:37.946,The lad's got a price on his head.
00:36:37.988,00:36:41.825,Would not be long before Captain Randall or the watch had him in irons.
00:36:41.867,00:36:44.744,The only safe place in Scotland is here at Leoch.
00:36:48.165,00:36:49.332,Until now.
00:36:51.043,00:36:56.214,"If Jamie had just stayed hidden till the gathering was over, Colum and Dougal wouldna pressed the matter any further."
00:36:59.217,00:37:01.928,So leaving the stables to escort me back...
00:37:01.970,00:37:03.221,"Oh, God, this is all my fault."
00:37:04.222,00:37:06.349,Aye...
00:37:06.391,00:37:07.350,It is.
00:37:42.886,00:37:50.018,"Colum MacKenzie, I come to you as kinsman and as ally."
00:37:53.897,00:37:55.273,But I give ye no vow.
00:38:03.364,00:38:06.868,For my oath is pledged to the name that I bear.
00:38:18.337,00:38:21.299,I give you my obedience as kinsman...
00:38:25.637,00:38:26.972,And as laird.
00:39:27.866,00:39:28.992,Whoo!
00:40:12.202,00:40:13.703,You're too old for this.
00:40:40.646,00:40:42.190,It's quite the show of force for a pig hunt.
00:40:43.942,00:40:45.693,It's a boar.
00:40:45.735,00:40:47.486,"Oh, of course."
00:40:47.528,00:40:49.739,20 men armed with spears and muskets.
00:40:49.781,00:40:51.908,Seems about right to kill one hairy pig.
00:40:54.286,00:40:55.745,You've plainly never seen one then.
00:40:57.372,00:40:58.748,Get yer mount.
00:40:59.624,00:41:00.833,Time to go.
00:42:28.004,00:42:28.880,Mistress Claire!
00:42:33.092,00:42:34.552,Serves you right.
00:42:34.593,00:42:37.680,What'd you expect the poor animal to do with you barbarians chasing it?
00:42:37.722,00:42:40.433,Did you forget their tusks could be lethal?
00:42:40.475,00:42:45.230,"Bring him back up to the castle, and tell Mrs. Fitz to give him some hot broth and some blankets."
00:42:45.271,00:42:48.274,"It'll need to be stitched, but I don't have any sterile tools here."
00:42:48.316,00:42:49.567,So he'll be all right then?
00:42:50.235,00:42:51.861,"Yes, you'll have a limp."
00:42:54.030,00:42:56.157,Maybe next time you'll think about going fishing.
00:42:59.618,00:43:01.371,"All right, take him back now."
00:43:02.539,00:43:03.998,Lass.
00:43:04.040,00:43:05.333,Wait for me.
00:43:06.125,00:43:07.126,Wait!
00:43:16.469,00:43:18.596,Where are you?
00:43:54.715,00:43:56.509,"DOUGAL: Now then. Now then, Geordie, now then."
00:43:56.551,00:43:57.635,You're gonna be all right.
00:43:58.470,00:44:00.221,"I've got you, man, okay?"
00:44:00.263,00:44:01.556,You'll be all right.
00:44:07.937,00:44:09.688,"Dougal, is it bad?"
00:44:12.609,00:44:14.152,You'll be fine.
00:44:14.193,00:44:15.403,You're gonna be fine.
00:44:15.445,00:44:18.948,"CLAIRE: It wasn't spurting, which meant the femoral artery wasn't cut."
00:44:18.990,00:44:21.326,So there was a good chance I could stop the bleeding at the thigh.
00:44:22.535,00:44:23.786,Will I lose my leg?
00:44:23.828,00:44:26.372,"No. No, you won't."
00:44:26.414,00:44:29.250,But that would only allow him to linger in increasing agony.
00:44:31.419,00:44:32.253,The wound to his abdomen...
00:44:33.754,00:44:34.839,...was fatal.
00:44:53.566,00:44:54.691,Here.
00:45:05.662,00:45:08.956,"A better death, perhaps, was what Dougal was giving him..."
00:45:08.998,00:45:15.672,"To die cleanly under this sky, his heart's blood staining the same leaves dyed by the blood of the beast that killed him."
00:45:16.506,00:45:18.550,"Dougal, man."
00:45:19.634,00:45:29.602,"I need to know, after we raided the clan MacDonald and stole the 20 kine from under their noses..."
00:45:29.644,00:45:30.727,"Aye, I remember."
00:45:32.188,00:45:33.898,We held up at Florrach for days.
00:45:35.608,00:45:38.277,"But we ate well, no?"
00:45:38.319,00:45:39.654,"Aye, we did for sure."
00:45:41.406,00:45:43.282,"Tell me here now, man."
00:45:44.992,00:45:46.743,Did you bed my sister Doreen?
00:45:50.998,00:45:52.166,Aye.
00:45:52.208,00:45:53.334,I did bed her.
00:45:56.546,00:45:57.838,"But, you know, she was a bonnie lass."
00:45:57.880,00:45:59.131,I ken it.
00:46:00.841,00:46:02.759,You always could charm the lasses.
00:46:03.386,00:46:04.596,Shh.
00:46:08.849,00:46:09.808,It will be better soon.
00:46:10.893,00:46:12.311,The pain will be gone soon.
00:46:16.441,00:46:17.774,It feels better now.
00:46:23.573,00:46:24.949,"I canna feel my leg anymore, Dougal."
00:46:29.621,00:46:30.787,My hands neither.
00:46:33.666,00:46:34.875,"Dougal, are you there, man?"
00:46:34.917,00:46:36.793,"I'm here, I'm here, I'm here."
00:46:37.253,00:46:38.630,I've got you.
00:46:39.838,00:46:40.797,Geordie...
00:46:45.511,00:46:46.512,Tell me about your home.
00:46:53.478,00:46:57.814,"It's near a wide glen, not far from Loch Fannich."
00:46:59.484,00:47:00.777,What's it like there?
00:47:01.860,00:47:03.154,I'll wager it's beautiful.
00:47:05.323,00:47:06.658,"Ah, 'tis."
00:47:09.327,00:47:10.662,In the spring...
00:47:16.041,00:47:21.255,"The heather's so thick, ye can walk across the tops without touching the ground."
00:47:22.381,00:47:23.716,That sounds lovely.
00:47:25.802,00:47:27.178,Wish I could be there now.
00:47:29.096,00:47:30.556,"Oh, you'll be there soon, lad."
00:47:32.183,00:47:33.100,GEORDIE: Aye.
00:47:34.268,00:47:35.603,Will ye stay with me?
00:47:36.646,00:47:38.230,Aye.
00:47:47.906,00:47:50.326,There.
00:48:46.841,00:48:48.217,MAN: Get the ball!
00:48:48.259,00:48:49.926,MAN 2: Pass it! Pass it!
00:49:38.058,00:49:40.185,"I taught you this game, lad."
00:49:40.227,00:49:41.270,That ye did.
00:49:50.404,00:49:51.988,Murtagh!
00:50:05.503,00:50:06.921,Didn't look very fair.
00:50:11.801,00:50:13.009,That's twice ye caught me napping.
00:50:18.641,00:50:20.559,Yield!
00:50:20.601,00:50:22.018,What would you think of me if I did?
00:50:22.060,00:50:23.270,Not much.
00:50:27.358,00:50:28.609,Play fair now.
00:50:32.321,00:50:33.322,Aah!
00:50:58.263,00:50:59.390,Ye taught me well.
00:51:00.516,00:51:02.560,Aye. Too well.
00:51:19.075,00:51:20.285,Did we win?
00:51:22.120,00:51:23.372,CLAIRE: My escape attempt thwarted...
00:51:24.540,00:51:28.544,I was faced with the terrifying possibility that I was destined to stay in this dungeon forever.
00:51:35.342,00:51:39.095,"I wasn't ready to give up, but I needed time to come up with another plan."
00:51:41.515,00:51:45.101,You've seen men die before and by violence.
00:51:47.354,00:51:48.397,Yes.
00:51:48.940,00:51:50.106,Many of them.
00:52:04.830,00:52:06.122,Ye've done a fine job here as healer.
00:52:09.710,00:52:13.129,Mrs. Fitz would have ye sit for a portrait if it was up to her.
00:52:19.095,00:52:25.851,"And, uh, I wanted to thank you personally for what you did for poor Geordie up there on the hunt."
00:52:27.895,00:52:29.897,"In truth, I did nothing."
00:52:31.065,00:52:33.149,I wish I could have helped him.
00:52:35.069,00:52:39.657,"Ye took him to a peaceful place, and that's all any of us can ask when we pass."
00:52:39.698,00:52:42.158,So... Thank you.
00:52:46.538,00:52:47.999,You're welcome.
00:52:53.462,00:52:56.048,"If there's nothing else, you'll have to excuse me."
00:52:56.090,00:52:58.174,I've a lot to do here in my dungeon.
00:52:59.468,00:53:05.766,"Well, that's why I'm here, lass, to set ye free from this dank room."
00:53:08.894,00:53:10.604,What do you mean?
00:53:11.396,00:53:12.523,On the road?
00:53:12.564,00:53:14.650,"I'm leaving tomorrow, and I'm taking you with me."
00:53:17.486,00:53:18.403,Taking me where?
00:53:20.072,00:53:22.533,"Traveling through MacKenzie lands, collecting rents."
00:53:23.450,00:53:33.460,"Colum doesna travel, so visiting the tenants and tacksmen that can't come to the gathering, that falls to me, and attending to a wee bit of business here and there."
00:53:35.295,00:53:36.505,But why me?
00:53:37.882,00:53:46.515,"I think it would be wise to have a healer along, especially one that does well under strain."
00:53:46.557,00:53:48.266,And there's a lot of that on the road.
00:53:51.603,00:53:53.731,So that's the business settled.
00:53:54.982,00:53:59.611,"Mrs. Fitz will have supper ready, and ye don't want to incur her wrath by coming late."
00:54:01.613,00:54:03.323,We leave at first light.
00:54:41.319,00:54:49.078,"CLAIRE: As the confines of the castle walls faded behind me like a bad dream, I took my first full breath in weeks."
00:54:49.120,00:54:55.333,"I had no idea where this journey would lead me, what opportunity might present itself."
00:54:55.375,00:54:59.295,I could only hope it would bring me closer to the standing stones of Craigh na Dun.
00:55:00.589,00:55:07.303,"If so, I was determined to reach them, knowing this time I must not fail."
00:00:01.251,00:00:03.671,CLAIRE: Previously.. .
00:00:03.712,00:00:06.214,I seem to have fallen through time.
00:00:06.256,00:00:09.468,The village has been humming with talk of you since you came to the castle.
00:00:09.510,00:00:11.010,CLAIRE: What is it they're saying about me?
00:00:11.052,00:00:13.889,I suspect you may be an English spy.
00:00:13.931,00:00:15.766,I'll have you watched day and night.
00:00:15.808,00:00:17.351,JAMIE: Redcoats wanted to send a message.
00:00:22.314,00:00:23.732,CLAIRE: She came back through the stones?
00:00:23.774,00:00:26.193,"JAMIE: Aye, she did."
00:00:26.234,00:00:27.486,CLAIRE: I need to leave this place.
00:00:27.528,00:00:32.867,JAMIE: You need not be scared of me nor anyone else here as long as I'm with ye.
00:00:32.908,00:00:34.493,"I'm leavin' tomorrow, and I'm takin' you with me."
00:00:35.160,00:00:36.620,But why me?
00:00:36.662,00:00:40.040,DOUGAL: I think it would be wise to have a healer along.
00:00:40.081,00:00:44.670,"CLAIRE: Another chance to go home presented itself, knowing this time, I must not fail."
00:02:22.476,00:02:23.685,Absence.
00:02:26.730,00:02:32.987,"Absence, hear thou my protestation against thy strength, distance, and length."
00:02:34.738,00:02:38.158,Do what thou canst for alteration...
00:02:38.199,00:02:40.953,BOTH: For hearts of truest mettle.
00:02:40.995,00:02:44.081,Absence doth still and time doth settle.
00:02:52.380,00:02:54.549,You know John Donne?
00:02:54.591,00:02:56.093,He's one of my favorites.
00:03:02.265,00:03:04.392,Away an bile yer heids!
00:03:04.434,00:03:06.561,What is it they're shouting over there?
00:03:09.690,00:03:11.775,I'm sorry.
00:03:11.817,00:03:14.486,"Well, my lady, they're teasing young Willie."
00:03:14.528,00:03:17.196,It's his first time on the road with us.
00:03:18.740,00:03:22.744,And they're encouraging him to have biblical relations...
00:03:24.705,00:03:25.580,With his sister.
00:03:28.500,00:03:29.417,Lovely.
00:03:39.594,00:03:40.804,Come away.
00:03:43.223,00:03:45.517,"You're Ned Gowan, aren't you?"
00:03:45.559,00:03:46.560,NED: Indeed.
00:03:47.686,00:03:49.688,CLAIRE: I've see you at the hall.
00:03:49.730,00:03:53.108,I'm Claire.
00:03:53.150,00:03:57.696,"I've just come along to help Dougal with the records and the receipts, you know."
00:03:59.239,00:04:01.491,"I'm the only one he'll trust with the money, ye ken."
00:04:03.827,00:04:05.954,"Ah, this is lovely."
00:04:05.996,00:04:09.290,Is that goose feather?
00:04:09.332,00:04:11.334,"Tools of the trade, you see."
00:04:11.376,00:04:15.422,And that bag is for the laird's rents.
00:04:15.463,00:04:18.425,"It comes in turners and bawbees, small coins."
00:04:18.466,00:04:22.554,But we also get bags of grain and cabbages.
00:04:22.596,00:04:30.104,"And fowl suitably trussed, I've got no argument with, even goats, although one of them ate my handkerchief last year."
00:04:30.145,00:04:33.023,But I have given explicit instructions this year...
00:04:33.065,00:04:35.609,...that...
00:04:35.650,00:04:39.154,That we will not accept live pigs.
00:04:42.032,00:04:44.201,I don't like the sound of that cough.
00:04:44.243,00:04:47.037,"Well, I get fair puckled this stretch of the road."
00:04:47.079,00:04:47.955,It happens every year...
00:04:47.996,00:04:49.998,The same season.
00:04:50.040,00:04:53.252,Something in the wind sets my lungs afire.
00:04:54.377,00:04:56.964,I think I may be able to help you.
00:04:57.005,00:04:58.966,Do you have a pipe I could borrow?
00:04:59.007,00:05:00.300,"Aye, a pipe."
00:05:02.052,00:05:05.180,"You'd have me smoke a pipe for a cough, eh?"
00:05:05.222,00:05:07.141,"It's something of a paradox, eh?"
00:05:07.182,00:05:08.391,You'll see.
00:05:12.271,00:05:13.354,Aye.
00:05:14.564,00:05:15.983,There you are.
00:05:16.900,00:05:18.819,It's thorn apple.
00:05:18.860,00:05:20.403,"Thorn apple, okay."
00:05:23.740,00:05:24.950,Take that.
00:05:26.910,00:05:28.996,NED: Thorn apple you say.
00:05:29.037,00:05:30.371,Is that an English thing?
00:05:31.915,00:05:33.959,CLAIRE: Also known as jimsonweed.
00:05:34.001,00:05:37.336,The herb had medicinal properties that would relieve the symptoms of asthma.
00:05:51.018,00:05:52.227,Ooh.
00:05:52.269,00:05:53.895,"Ah, well..."
00:05:54.896,00:05:57.149,That's remarkable.
00:05:57.191,00:05:58.733,"Aye, pack up."
00:06:02.779,00:06:36.313,"DOUGAL: the mill ae nicht ALL: DOUGAL: and stars sae bricht ALL: her corn grun' DOUGAL: the corn grun' ALL: DOUGAL: the miller's man ALL: sae wanton DOUGAL: her corn grun' ALL: I'm curious, Mr. Gowan, what possessed a man of your qualifications to take up a post in these remote Highlands."
00:06:36.355,00:06:41.151,"Well, as a young man, I studied law at the University of Edinburgh."
00:06:41.193,00:06:49.576,"I had a small practice with lace curtains in the window, shiny brass plate with my name on it on the door."
00:06:50.785,00:06:51.953,"Oh, it was."
00:06:51.995,00:06:53.914,But I grew restless.
00:06:59.669,00:07:05.259,"So I determined the best course was to head off northwards, up here into the Highlands."
00:07:05.300,00:07:08.803,And I thought that I might induce some clan chief to allow me to serve him.
00:07:08.845,00:07:10.264,"Colum MacKenzie, I take it."
00:07:10.305,00:07:12.807,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
00:07:10.305,00:07:14.268,"His father, Jacob."
00:07:14.309,00:07:16.061,"I'm much older than I appear, lassie."
00:07:17.645,00:07:20.815,"But, of course, things were much less civilized then."
00:07:20.857,00:07:29.449,"Back then, when men were men and the pernicious weed of civilization was less rampant upon the wild, bonny face of this land."
00:07:31.159,00:07:35.455,"Ah, you may be a man of the law, sir, but you've the soul of a romantic."
00:07:40.585,00:07:53.140,"CLAIRE: Although this newfound kinship with Ned would make life on the road more tolerable, I could not allow it to distract me from my quest to get back to the standing stones at Craigh Na Dun and return to my own 20th century life."
00:08:08.113,00:08:09.614,DOUGAL: Old granny...
00:08:12.159,00:08:14.535,So old granny Mary...
00:08:14.577,00:08:18.039,"Old granny Mary's gettin' ready for bed, and she says to her husband..."
00:08:18.081,00:08:21.376,"When you first saw me naked, what were you thinkin'?"
00:08:21.418,00:08:25.922,"And he says, I wanted to suck your paps dry."
00:08:25.964,00:08:29.384,I wanted to swive you until you were a worn-out husk.
00:08:29.426,00:08:33.013,"And she says to him, And what are you thinkin' now?"
00:08:33.054,00:08:36.557,"And he looks at her and says, Looks like I've done a fine job."
00:09:02.292,00:09:11.968,"CLAIRE: I wasn't offended by the lewdness of their jokes or squeamish over the fact that my dinner looked like a shriveled Easter rabbit, nor was I too dainty to sleep on a pillow made of stone."
00:09:18.266,00:09:22.479,CLAIRE: What troubled me was that they were clearly using Gaelic to exclude me.
00:09:28.276,00:09:31.654,I just had to remember my time with them would be over soon.
00:09:31.696,00:09:33.781,Being on the road was my chance to escape.
00:09:44.543,00:09:46.336,"Dinna worry what they're sayin', lass."
00:09:47.087,00:09:48.296,They hate me.
00:09:49.756,00:09:50.590,They don't trust you.
00:09:54.553,00:09:57.805,"Maybe Angus hates you, but he hates everyone."
00:10:00.392,00:10:02.602,What about you?
00:10:04.312,00:10:06.064,No.
00:10:06.106,00:10:12.195,"But I do think there are things you're not tellin' us, and I know you tried to run durin' the gatherin'."
00:10:13.696,00:10:16.241,"It's on your mind still, plain and clear."
00:10:19.953,00:10:20.828,It's been a long day.
00:10:26.626,00:10:27.752,"Well, ye did ask."
00:10:51.901,00:10:53.736,Alastair!
00:10:53.778,00:10:56.573,I hear you and the wife have another one on the way.
00:10:56.615,00:10:57.991,You're a beast of a man.
00:10:58.032,00:11:00.327,"I'm a MacKenzie, ye ken."
00:11:01.702,00:11:03.830,And how was the harvest?
00:11:03.871,00:11:06.166,"I bring two bags of grain, six shilling."
00:11:06.207,00:11:07.667,"Fine, six shillings."
00:11:07.708,00:11:11.087,That's two bags of grain and six shillings.
00:11:11.129,00:11:13.131,Trust we'll see you tonight?
00:11:13.173,00:11:14.508,Good man.
00:11:17.552,00:11:18.845,"NED: And it'll be your usual, then..."
00:11:27.187,00:11:28.687,"Oh, and who do we have here?"
00:11:29.939,00:11:32.275,You couldn't be Beathan's boy.
00:11:32.317,00:11:34.569,"Well, time lets the truth slip, ye ken."
00:11:34.611,00:11:39.240,"Looks like your mother let a big, brawny fellow into her bed while your faither wasn't lookin'."
00:11:39.282,00:11:40.908,As the old cock craws.
00:11:40.950,00:11:42.118,"Oh, is that right?"
00:11:44.538,00:11:46.498,There's a bag of oat.
00:11:48.542,00:11:50.418,"Marcas, you limmer, it's good to see you."
00:11:50.460,00:11:51.836,What've you got for me?
00:11:56.633,00:11:57.716,Hello.
00:12:01.304,00:12:05.684,That's two fat pigs and a fine goat.
00:12:05.724,00:12:07.310,We'll see you tonight.
00:12:08.144,00:12:09.521,Aye! Good.
00:12:09.563,00:12:11.105,I thought you said no pigs.
00:12:12.065,00:12:13.732,"Aye, I did, didn't I?"
00:12:14.984,00:12:16.570,"Duncan, thank you."
00:12:16.611,00:12:17.904,Two shilling and...
00:12:35.004,00:12:36.673,"Something I can do for you, mistress?"
00:12:38.383,00:12:41.052,I was just curious.
00:12:41.094,00:12:43.846,I've never heard singing quite like that before.
00:12:43.888,00:12:46.391,This a waulking song.
00:12:47.475,00:12:48.893,I'm Claire Beauchamp.
00:12:48.935,00:12:50.729,I'm Donalda Gilchrest.
00:12:50.769,00:12:53.690,I came with the MacKenzie party.
00:12:53.732,00:12:56.568,"The men are all busy with the rent, so I found myself rather idle."
00:12:57.818,00:12:59.153,"Idle, ye say."
00:13:00.363,00:13:01.780,"Well, we'll see about that."
00:13:03.700,00:13:05.201,"Do ye have strong hands, Claire?"
00:13:21.926,00:13:23.595,"DONALDA: Ladies, this is Claire Beauchamp."
00:13:24.763,00:13:26.681,She's going to be helping us today.
00:13:26.723,00:13:27.766,"Hello, all."
00:13:34.689,00:13:36.149,"CLAIRE: Ugh, that's pungent."
00:13:36.190,00:13:37.317,Is that...
00:13:37.358,00:13:38.817,Hot piss.
00:13:39.360,00:13:40.278,Sets the dye fast.
00:14:41.255,00:14:43.007,"Here's a wee refreshment, Claire."
00:14:43.049,00:14:43.924,Ye've earned it.
00:14:44.425,00:14:45.760,Thank you.
00:14:48.388,00:14:49.889,Bottoms up.
00:14:56.771,00:14:59.190,"Oh, my God, that's got a kick to it."
00:14:59.232,00:15:01.108,It's our little secret.
00:15:01.150,00:15:02.777,Not a word to the menfolk.
00:15:02.819,00:15:04.904,My lips are sealed.
00:15:07.114,00:15:08.449,Did we wake the little one?
00:15:08.491,00:15:10.243,"He's hungry, that's all."
00:15:10.284,00:15:13.162,"Oh, he's teething and won't nurse."
00:15:13.204,00:15:18.501,"My husband had to give away our goat the laird this morning, so we haven't any milk."
00:15:18.543,00:15:19.878,Doesn't seem very fair.
00:15:21.087,00:15:23.464,"Where are ye off to next, Claire?"
00:15:23.506,00:15:25.341,"Uh, I'm not sure exactly."
00:15:28.386,00:15:31.598,I heard stories of a place called Craigh Na Dun.
00:15:31.639,00:15:33.725,"Aye, where the fairies live."
00:15:33.767,00:15:36.936,"My cousin went there once, swore he saw one."
00:15:36.977,00:15:45.570,"But he was fou as a puggie at the time, and the fairy he claimed to see turned out to be an old piebald sheep, sporting six horns."
00:15:47.947,00:15:49.908,"Well, I'd like to go there."
00:15:49.949,00:15:51.701,Is it nearby?
00:15:51.743,00:15:54.954,"Oh, about three days as the crow flies, I'd say."
00:15:56.247,00:15:57.331,"All right, back to work, ladies."
00:15:58.499,00:16:00.835,And we're going to need a fresh bucket.
00:16:08.426,00:16:10.136,You mean now?
00:16:10.177,00:16:11.721,What do you think the tipple's for?
00:16:14.724,00:16:16.309,"All righty, then."
00:16:19.938,00:16:20.980,Geronimo.
00:16:30.990,00:16:31.991,"Oh, Christ almighty."
00:16:33.660,00:16:35.495,I've been looking to hell and back for ye.
00:16:35.536,00:16:37.413,I've been right here.
00:16:37.455,00:16:39.373,Right!
00:16:39.415,00:16:40.374,But we haven't finished.
00:16:40.416,00:16:41.626,"Aye, ye have."
00:16:46.631,00:16:48.090,Disappearing under ma nose.
00:16:48.132,00:16:50.009,Dougal's bealing about it.
00:16:50.050,00:16:52.136,I was only over there.
00:16:52.178,00:16:54.931,"Ye've been drinking, and ye smell like piss."
00:16:54.973,00:16:56.599,"Well, that's the pot calling the kettle black."
00:16:56.641,00:16:58.017,Fine.
00:16:58.058,00:16:59.853,"Next time, I'll tie ye to the wagon."
00:16:59.894,00:17:01.437,Get your hands off me!
00:17:12.657,00:17:14.492,"Hey, hey, where do you think you're taking that?"
00:17:14.534,00:17:16.661,Back to her owner.
00:17:16.703,00:17:19.288,The goat's ours.
00:17:19.330,00:17:21.708,"That's goods and chattels, has to be accounted for."
00:17:21.749,00:17:24.002,Ca' canny noo.
00:17:24.043,00:17:25.211,I am no such thing.
00:17:25.252,00:17:26.880,You'll be giving me the goat!
00:17:26.921,00:17:28.047,Let go!
00:17:29.382,00:17:30.884,Where did you find her?
00:17:30.925,00:17:32.301,Over there and cock-a-doodle-dooed.
00:17:34.261,00:17:36.639,How hard is it to keep watch on a Sassenach wench?
00:17:36.681,00:17:39.225,"Hey, she's slippery as an eel, that one, Dougal."
00:17:39.266,00:17:40.852,Would you stop talking about me as if I'm not here?
00:17:41.811,00:17:42.979,There's a baby that needs milk.
00:17:44.731,00:17:46.482,"Stop yer havering, woman."
00:17:46.524,00:17:48.902,"The beast is payment for rent, fair and square."
00:17:50.361,00:17:51.738,So you'd let a child go hungry?
00:17:54.991,00:17:56.075,The goat goes with us.
00:18:03.041,00:18:05.710,A Sassenach fleein' drunk forbye.
00:18:09.088,00:18:10.089,"MAN: Madam, is everything all right?"
00:18:14.802,00:18:15.887,I'm sorry?
00:18:16.679,00:18:17.847,May I be of service?
00:18:17.889,00:18:20.558,"Aye, you'll keep your nose out of our business."
00:18:22.810,00:18:24.020,I was speaking to the lady.
00:18:24.062,00:18:27.356,The lady is a guest of clan MacKenzie.
00:18:27.398,00:18:28.733,Do you treat all your guests this way?
00:18:28.775,00:18:31.193,"Hey, bugger off."
00:18:34.822,00:18:36.824,Or maybe your lugs need cleaning out.
00:18:36.866,00:18:39.285,"I assure you, sir, my lugs are perfectly fine."
00:18:39.326,00:18:44.123,"Go home, laddie, and suckle on your ma's tit, eh?"
00:19:09.816,00:19:11.275,"Now, get to it."
00:19:30.128,00:19:32.588,"DOUGAL: Aye, aye, the land's been good to ye this year."
00:19:32.630,00:19:34.132,Aye.
00:19:34.173,00:19:37.051,I hear ye've had a braw harvest of oats.
00:19:37.384,00:19:38.511,Aye.
00:19:38.552,00:19:42.598,"Galloway, I can tell you've not been starving."
00:19:44.224,00:19:47.561,You want to watch yer back around these drunken bastards showing a pair of paps like thon.
00:19:51.024,00:19:52.108,Aye.
00:22:09.536,00:22:12.915,"It's not a great deal, but we canna expect much from a small place like this still."
00:22:15.375,00:22:20.840,"And with young Jamie's back to show, it's money in the bank guaranteed."
00:22:20.881,00:22:22.133,Be a good lass.
00:22:22.175,00:22:23.342,Get a needle and thread.
00:22:25.469,00:22:26.344,Mend it yourself.
00:22:28.639,00:22:31.058,I'm not bloody doing it.
00:22:31.100,00:22:32.476,The lad can wear rags from now on.
00:22:36.605,00:22:37.982,Fine.
00:22:41.861,00:22:42.820,I'll mend my own shirt.
00:23:04.925,00:23:06.052,NED: Black pudding?
00:23:08.428,00:23:10.388,"It's an acquired taste, I know, but..."
00:23:11.224,00:23:12.390,Thank you.
00:23:20.691,00:23:27.698,How do you think Colum will feel about you helping Dougal steal money from him to line his own pockets and using his nephew Jamie to do it?
00:23:30.201,00:23:31.409,Aren't you the canny lass?
00:23:32.452,00:23:34.372,Just wondering how it works.
00:23:34.412,00:23:37.041,"Two bags of money, obviously."
00:23:37.083,00:23:39.543,"Are there two sets of books as well, one for each brother?"
00:23:42.088,00:23:44.215,Seems that you've got it all sorted out.
00:23:45.591,00:23:49.845,I'll wager they don't teach common thievery at the University of Edinburgh.
00:23:49.887,00:23:52.598,I suspect that's a skill you've acquired more recently.
00:23:52.639,00:23:57.019,"I must say, you got a good head on your shoulders and a tongue for argument as well."
00:23:57.061,00:23:59.980,You'd make a fine advocate yerself.
00:24:00.022,00:24:03.734,It's a pity they don't allow women to practice law.
00:24:03.776,00:24:05.278,Hmm.
00:24:07.529,00:24:09.949,"Ah, it'll be a few centuries before that happens."
00:24:11.825,00:24:13.160,Only two.
00:24:17.915,00:24:24.713,"CLAIRE: It felt as if Dougal could read my mind, like he was daring me to run."
00:24:27.465,00:24:33.639,He had brought me along on this trip because I earned his respect as a healer and at least some measure of trust.
00:24:36.725,00:24:42.522,"But now I could see that small trust slipping away, and with it, my dream of escape."
00:24:46.568,00:24:49.363,"The days passed in a blur, turning into weeks."
00:24:51.782,00:24:56.578,"We visited village after village, my feeling of helplessness growing."
00:25:07.131,00:25:15.513,"Even amongst the vast and beautiful landscape, I felt trapped, as if I were back in the stone walls of Castle Leoch."
00:25:18.058,00:25:26.359,Would I have to reconcile myself to live the rest of my life amongst strangers 200 years in the past?
00:25:52.885,00:25:55.804,"No, no!"
00:25:57.973,00:25:59.016,What's going on?
00:25:59.058,00:26:01.060,It's the watch.
00:26:01.101,00:26:03.312,Men you pay to protect your cattle.
00:26:03.354,00:26:04.604,"Otherwise, they'll steal them themselves."
00:26:05.523,00:26:07.066,Extortionists.
00:26:18.244,00:26:19.870,Why burn the house?
00:26:19.912,00:26:22.706,ANGUS: It's a warning.
00:26:22.748,00:26:25.292,The husband's a sympathizer working with the redcoats.
00:26:25.334,00:26:26.960,That's only gossip.
00:26:27.002,00:26:29.046,It's no excuse for criminal behavior.
00:26:29.088,00:26:32.716,"The watch may be criminal, but they're Scots first."
00:26:32.758,00:26:35.593,They can't abide traitors who do the bidding of the British army.
00:26:51.026,00:26:52.194,How many?
00:26:52.236,00:26:53.571,MAN: Two.
00:26:55.489,00:26:57.491,CLAIRE: And Dougal taking his cut?
00:26:57.533,00:26:59.159,I suppose that's patriotism as well.
00:26:59.201,00:27:00.453,"Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear."
00:27:00.494,00:27:02.037,"No, no, no."
00:27:09.086,00:27:10.670,Where's Jamie?
00:27:10.712,00:27:14.133,"Oh, he's making himself scarce."
00:27:14.174,00:27:16.427,"He has a price on his head, remember."
00:27:16.469,00:27:19.637,The watch would turn him over in a minute if they thought there was profit involved.
00:27:19.679,00:27:21.390,Patriots until it profits them not to be.
00:27:22.724,00:27:24.935,Their loyalty lies where the money lies.
00:27:24.977,00:27:25.727,DOUGAL: Off we go.
00:27:35.737,00:27:42.828,"I was, I was slipping her the wee man all night long, and she was ganting for it."
00:27:44.538,00:27:46.624,I gave the lassie such a seeing-to.
00:27:49.209,00:27:50.794,She'll be walking bow-legged for months.
00:27:50.836,00:27:52.712,"Aye, aye, you sleekit dog."
00:27:56.258,00:27:57.510,"No, thank you."
00:27:57.551,00:27:58.676,What's the matter with you?
00:28:00.678,00:28:01.679,I've no stomach for stolen food.
00:28:08.562,00:28:09.938,And I don't sit with thieves.
00:28:11.524,00:28:14.692,I will not be judged by an English whore.
00:28:17.571,00:28:18.696,JAMIE: Angus.
00:28:19.990,00:28:21.074,Angus.
00:28:23.536,00:28:26.121,"She doesn't want it, all the more for us, huh?"
00:28:37.090,00:28:37.966,JAMIE: Huh?
00:28:38.925,00:28:39.926,Excuse me.
00:28:53.273,00:28:54.316,"Here, Rupert."
00:28:55.568,00:28:58.571,There's something to wrap your hands around other than your todger.
00:29:12.834,00:29:16.547,"What's got into you, woman, talking to Angus that way?"
00:29:16.589,00:29:18.090,Angus can kiss my English arse.
00:29:20.551,00:29:25.013,"Aye, he's a clarty bastard, but those are fighting words."
00:29:25.055,00:29:26.348,"Well, where I come from, we don't..."
00:29:26.390,00:29:29.184,It doesn't matter where you come from.
00:29:32.521,00:29:35.232,So I'm just to stand by and watch?
00:29:35.274,00:29:37.776,You're not to judge things you don't understand.
00:29:39.278,00:29:40.613,"Stay out of it, Claire."
00:30:58.607,00:30:59.858,Torcall.
00:31:08.701,00:31:11.244,You come to me with empty pockets.
00:31:11.286,00:31:16.875,"Redcoats came through two days ago, house to house, took what they wanted."
00:31:19.461,00:31:22.088,"You know me, brother."
00:31:22.130,00:31:24.675,"Every year, I pay what I owe to the MacKenzie."
00:31:25.967,00:31:29.888,But tonight I canna feed my family.
00:31:45.945,00:31:49.908,"Your family will have supper tonight, and afterwards, you'll join us for a drink."
00:31:51.951,00:31:53.871,All of ye will eat!
00:31:53.912,00:31:55.539,Join us tonight for a dram.
00:31:58.667,00:31:59.585,I know what you're doing.
00:32:00.794,00:32:04.506,"The more mercy you show today, the more you collect tonight for yourself."
00:32:05.716,00:32:08.677,"Aye, the lassie can see right through us."
00:32:08.719,00:32:11.346,"We Scots are not as canny as the English, yes."
00:32:13.348,00:32:15.934,Good thing we're not doing this in Oxfordshire.
00:32:21.815,00:32:23.066,What is it that you're accusing me of?
00:32:25.527,00:32:28.488,"A penny for the laird, a pound for your own pocket."
00:32:28.530,00:32:29.948,Whatever you wish to call it.
00:32:33.076,00:32:36.162,"I call it clan business, and none of yours."
00:33:11.197,00:33:20.373,"CLAIRE: Events followed a familiar pattern, but for my sympathies for Jamie, I had little interest in Dougal's self-serving performance."
00:33:20.415,00:33:24.294,"The language as alien as ever, but the sentiment clear."
00:33:24.336,00:33:29.257,"Give us your money, and we will protect you from the English, from the Sassenachs."
00:33:29.299,00:33:31.677,"An awful sight, is it no?"
00:33:31.718,00:33:35.597,"Christ, I'd die in my blood before I let a whey-faced Sassenach use me so."
00:33:35.639,00:33:37.766,Aye.
00:33:39.434,00:33:42.813,CLAIRE: But then my ears sparked to a name I'd heard somewhere before.
00:33:51.738,00:33:55.033,"MAN: Of course that would be the second Jacobite rising, the '45."
00:33:56.409,00:33:58.244,Second?
00:33:58.286,00:34:01.581,"You know, some people actually argue that there were four uprisings."
00:34:01.623,00:34:06.378,"The first in 1715, and the '45 was just the most famous one."
00:34:06.419,00:34:08.714,Bonnie Prince Charlie and so on.
00:34:08.755,00:34:10.757,MAN: That's it.
00:34:10.799,00:34:17.639,"Charlie, the young pretender to the throne of Britain, was gathering Stuart sympathizers called Jacobites for a rebellion."
00:34:17.681,00:34:19.725,Surely your uncle Lamb taught you some of this.
00:34:21.601,00:34:23.061,What were you doing in the desert?
00:34:26.023,00:34:33.697,"Jacobite, derived from Jacobus, the Latin for James, since they were followers of King James II, the Catholic king dethroned by the Protestants."
00:34:35.156,00:34:37.075,Show-off.
00:34:38.535,00:34:42.497,So the Jacobites dedicated themselves to restoring a Catholic king.
00:34:42.539,00:34:46.167,And Charles Stuart used the Scottish Highlanders to raise money for a Jacobite army.
00:34:47.168,00:34:49.170,A lost cause as it turned out.
00:35:03.018,00:35:08.189,CLAIRE: I was beginning to realize the activities Dougal and his men were involved in weren't criminal.
00:35:08.231,00:35:10.567,They were political.
00:35:10.609,00:35:17.991,"He was using the shocking display of Jamie's scars not to frighten his audience, but to stir outrage against the British."
00:35:20.285,00:35:22.996,Dougal was raising money for a Jacobite army.
00:35:24.205,00:35:26.959,"JAMIE: Devil take ye, Dougal MacKenzie."
00:35:27.000,00:35:29.628,"Kinsman or not, I don't owe ye this."
00:35:29.669,00:35:33.840,DOUGAL: I seem to recall a certain oath of obedience.
00:35:33.882,00:35:36.676,So long as my feet rest on the lands of clan MacKenzie.
00:35:36.718,00:35:38.511,"JAMIE: I gave my word to Colum, not to you."
00:35:38.553,00:35:40.639,"It's one and the same, lad, and you ken it well."
00:35:41.681,00:35:46.979,"Outside of Leoch, I am Colum's head, hands, as well as his legs."
00:35:47.020,00:35:50.523,JAMIE: I never saw a better case of the right hand not knowing what the left was up to.
00:35:50.565,00:35:53.693,"The MacKenzies, the MacBeolains, the MacVinishes..."
00:35:53.735,00:35:56.154,None can force them to give against their will.
00:35:57.447,00:35:59.157,But we have something in common.
00:36:00.199,00:36:02.452,We want our king back where he belongs.
00:36:06.414,00:36:07.248,Don't you?
00:36:11.210,00:36:13.421,You have more to gain from a Stuart throne than I do.
00:36:13.463,00:36:14.923,If you don't want to save your own silly neck...
00:36:14.965,00:36:19.427,"My neck is my own concern, and so is my back."
00:36:19.469,00:36:21.513,"Not while you travel with me, sweet lad."
00:37:06.016,00:37:09.061,"He'll do that again, use you like that?"
00:37:10.103,00:37:11.188,Aye.
00:37:12.313,00:37:14.566,"Aye, it gets him what he wants, you see."
00:37:17.986,00:37:19.445,And you'll let him?
00:37:22.657,00:37:24.159,He's my uncle.
00:37:30.665,00:37:36.254,"A man has to, to choose what's worth fighting for."
00:37:43.469,00:37:44.846,As you ken well.
00:37:57.650,00:37:58.735,"Well, best get some sleep."
00:38:01.738,00:38:02.781,"Yes, of course."
00:38:06.201,00:38:07.869,Try not to hit any more trees.
00:38:10.705,00:38:12.207,Don't worry.
00:38:13.083,00:38:15.127,"Trees are safe, Sassenach."
00:38:19.756,00:38:20.757,Good night.
00:38:44.281,00:38:49.161,"CLAIRE: The next morning as I watched them pack, I saw the men in a different light."
00:38:52.413,00:38:58.711,"I wished I could tell them that they were on the losing side of history, that it was all a pipe dream."
00:38:58.753,00:39:09.347,"The Stuarts would never unseat the Protestant King George II, but how could I tell them that, these proud, passionate men who lived and breathed for a flag of blue and white?"
00:40:20.543,00:40:21.419,DOUGAL: Traitor.
00:40:24.964,00:40:30.095,CLAIRE: Even I knew that this was not the work of the watch but of the redcoats.
00:40:30.136,00:40:31.596,They've been out here at least a week.
00:40:31.637,00:40:33.639,"More, likely, by the smell."
00:40:34.473,00:40:35.641,Bloody bastards!
00:40:40.897,00:40:41.940,Take them down.
00:40:43.524,00:40:45.402,Wrap the bodies.
00:40:45.443,00:40:47.070,We'll give them a proper Christian burial.
00:43:22.850,00:43:25.228,What are you doing sneaking around outside my door?
00:43:25.270,00:43:27.063,I wasn't sneaking about.
00:43:25.270,00:43:28.606,I was sleeping or trying to.
00:43:29.648,00:43:30.983,Sleeping here?
00:43:31.443,00:43:32.569,Why?
00:43:34.279,00:43:38.157,The taproom's full of townsmen half gone with drink.
00:43:38.199,00:43:42.703,I was worried some of them might venture up here in search of well...
00:43:42.745,00:43:44.622,I didn't think you'd care overmuch for such attentions.
00:43:47.166,00:43:51.629,"After the events of today, I doubt any of them are feeling very kindly towards an Englishwoman."
00:43:58.761,00:44:00.179,I stepped on you.
00:44:02.223,00:44:03.600,You're being kind.
00:44:08.563,00:44:10.607,You can't sleep out here.
00:44:10.648,00:44:12.858,At least come into the room.
00:44:13.485,00:44:14.777,It's warmer.
00:44:16.488,00:44:19.949,Sleep in your room with you?
00:44:19.991,00:44:22.660,I couldn't do that.
00:44:25.079,00:44:27.624,My reputation?
00:44:27.665,00:44:32.962,"You've slept under the stars with me before, you and ten other men."
00:44:33.004,00:44:34.672,That isn't the same thing at all.
00:44:38.676,00:44:41.471,"Well, at least let me give you the blanket off my bed."
00:44:41.513,00:44:43.348,Or is that too scandalous?
00:45:08.414,00:45:09.706,I'll be right here.
00:45:14.295,00:45:15.547,Night.
00:45:49.038,00:45:50.289,"Good morning, Mr. MacTavish."
00:45:50.331,00:45:51.748,"Morning, mistress."
00:45:53.042,00:45:56.337,"Now, if you'll excuse me, the horses will be needin' their breakfast as well."
00:46:26.158,00:46:28.327,Why did you let me think you were thieves?
00:46:30.871,00:46:32.749,What's made you think otherwise?
00:46:32.789,00:46:34.791,Dougal's speech the other night.
00:46:37.712,00:46:39.838,I thought you had no Gaelic.
00:46:39.880,00:46:44.927,"Well, I've picked up enough to understand what long live the Stuart sounds like."
00:46:44.969,00:46:46.971,You might've picked up more than you should.
00:46:52.226,00:46:55.938,What if I told you that the odds were stacked against you?
00:46:56.939,00:46:59.066,And which odds are those?
00:47:00.817,00:47:04.071,"Oh, that's a known fact."
00:47:04.113,00:47:06.240,You're raising money for a war that you cannot win.
00:47:06.282,00:47:08.451,"And that worries you, does it?"
00:47:08.493,00:47:09.826,You're the ones that should be worried.
00:47:17.669,00:47:19.545,You talk as if the future is already decided.
00:47:20.379,00:47:27.219,"Outmanned we may be, but I would match our fighting hearts against the best army in the world."
00:47:27.261,00:47:29.681,Fighting hearts don't stand a chance against cannons.
00:47:30.847,00:47:32.016,You are going to lose.
00:47:33.434,00:47:36.853,"That's your opinion, and you're entitled to it."
00:47:41.150,00:47:42.694,"It's a fact, Ned."
00:47:43.486,00:47:45.571,You have to believe me.
00:47:45.613,00:47:53.870,"History will never record the name of another Stuart king, but it will record the names of thousands of Highlanders who've died needlessly for a doomed cause."
00:47:57.583,00:47:59.168,History be damned.
00:48:15.142,00:48:15.892,Here we go.
00:48:41.085,00:48:42.461,Get up!
00:48:42.503,00:48:44.380,Pick him up!
00:48:49.093,00:48:55.600,"CLAIRE: Three split lips, two bloody noses, twelve smashed knuckles, and four loosened teeth."
00:48:55.641,00:48:56.809,And my ribs hurt a bit.
00:48:58.352,00:49:01.689,RUPERT: Bastard's fingernail was sharp as a boar's tooth.
00:49:01.731,00:49:02.981,He's gouged a hole in me.
00:49:03.023,00:49:04.442,Ow!
00:49:04.483,00:49:06.360,You're such crybabies.
00:49:06.402,00:49:08.945,I've tended to six-year-olds braver than you lot.
00:49:09.906,00:49:11.449,Any excuse for a fight.
00:49:11.490,00:49:12.742,You were the excuse.
00:49:16.454,00:49:17.496,Me?
00:49:19.206,00:49:20.957,It was your honor we were defending.
00:49:22.126,00:49:23.836,The lout called you a whore.
00:49:31.260,00:49:32.720,You're a guest of the MacKenzie.
00:49:34.472,00:49:38.434,"We can insult you, but God help any other man that does."
00:49:53.699,00:50:01.582,"RUPERT: So there I am in bed, harelip chrissie on my left and sweaty netty, the butcher's daughter, on my right."
00:50:01.624,00:50:05.252,"They get jealous of each other, start arguin' about who I'm goin' to swive first."
00:50:05.962,00:50:07.797,Can you believe it?
00:50:07.839,00:50:10.257,I believe your left hand gets jealous of your right.
00:50:10.299,00:50:11.634,That's about all I believe.
00:50:28.776,00:50:30.319,You're a witty one.
00:50:32.571,00:50:35.157,I've never heard a woman make a joke!
00:50:35.199,00:50:36.784,There's a first time for everything.
00:50:41.580,00:50:42.623,Hard ride ahead.
00:50:44.416,00:50:46.042,Three days till we cross Culloden moor.
00:50:49.296,00:50:50.673,CLAIRE: Culloden moor.
00:50:57.596,00:51:01.225,FRANK: You can see how flat and open and boggy it is.
00:51:01.266,00:51:12.737,"The Highland army was completely exposed, and they then charged into the teeth of musket fire, cannons, mortars with nothing more than their broadswords, for the most part."
00:51:15.280,00:51:18.074,"It was very, very quick and very bloody."
00:51:19.451,00:51:21.077,The whole thing took less than an hour.
00:51:21.913,00:51:23.330,How many were killed?
00:51:23.372,00:51:26.291,"Jacobites lost something in the region of 2,000 men."
00:51:28.044,00:51:36.176,"But the interesting thing is that in the years following Culloden, the estates of the clan chieftains were plundered, sold."
00:51:36.218,00:51:38.596,The government banned the wearing of tartan.
00:51:38.637,00:51:42.474,"They banned the carrying of swords, even the Gaelic language."
00:51:42.516,00:51:49.105,"In effect, Culloden marked the end of the clans and the end of the Highlander way of life."
00:52:10.669,00:52:13.839,"CLAIRE: 1746, three years from now."
00:52:16.341,00:52:18.302,And what of these MacKenzie men?
00:52:19.595,00:52:23.057,How many of them were doomed to die on that wretched battlefield?
00:52:53.545,00:52:55.131,"Here, let me see."
00:53:01.261,00:53:02.805,"Thank you, Angus."
00:53:12.272,00:53:13.189,Eh.
00:53:23.117,00:53:24.368,I'm going to the river to wash.
00:53:27.621,00:53:28.998,Let her go.
00:53:32.126,00:53:35.004,the transactions...
00:53:39.591,00:53:43.219,Comparatively successful despite the earlier setbacks.
00:53:57.860,00:53:59.235,DOUGAL: Who are you?
00:54:02.073,00:54:04.533,An English lady of Oxfordshire.
00:54:04.575,00:54:05.784,That's what you'd have us believe.
00:54:07.411,00:54:11.207,"But you would seem to be a lady of strong political opinions, eh?"
00:54:11.247,00:54:12.624,There's no harm in an opinion.
00:54:12.666,00:54:14.960,You've seen things on the road.
00:54:15.711,00:54:18.964,"You tell the redcoats, and we'll be bound to crosses just like the men we cut down."
00:54:22.634,00:54:29.307,"But ye're sowin' the seeds of doubt in our midst, working behind the cover of yer woman's skirts to undermine the cause."
00:54:29.349,00:54:30.768,I am trying to warn you.
00:54:31.143,00:54:32.186,Huh.
00:54:32.895,00:54:34.063,Warn me about what?
00:54:39.944,00:54:42.238,I'm trying to save your life.
00:54:42.278,00:54:43.279,SOLDIER: Madam...
00:54:58.837,00:55:00.296,Pleasure to see you again.
00:55:04.969,00:55:06.220,"Once more, I ask you..."
00:55:14.937,00:55:16.272,Is everything all right?
00:55:23.946,00:55:25.948,"Hello, again, Officer."
00:55:25.990,00:55:29.367,Lieutenant Jeremy Foster of his majesty's army.
00:55:29.409,00:55:32.704,And this time I do mean to ascertain the lady's well-being.
00:55:32.746,00:55:35.040,The lady is none of your concern.
00:55:35.833,00:55:37.333,And you are?
00:55:37.375,00:55:44.340,"Dougal MacKenzie, war chief and brother to Colum, laird of the MacKenzie clan and the lands upon which you stand."
00:55:45.509,00:55:50.264,"MacKenzie or not, if you are holding this English lady against her wishes, you'll be dealt with."
00:55:52.683,00:55:54.768,"Tell me, madam, are you here by your own choice?"
00:00:02.795,00:00:04.922,CLAIRE: I seem to have fallen through time.
00:00:04.964,00:00:08.843,"You need not be scared of me, nor anyone else here, so long as I'm with ye."
00:00:11.094,00:00:13.555,I think it would be wise to have a healer along.
00:00:13.597,00:00:15.432,You're not Frank.
00:00:15.474,00:00:16.475,"No, madam, I'm not."
00:00:16.517,00:00:17.685,You know Black Jack Randall?
00:00:17.726,00:00:20.771,I won't risk you or anyone else being taken prisoner by that man.
00:00:20.813,00:00:25.985,CLAIRE: Captain of dragoons in the British army and your direct ancestor.
00:00:26.025,00:00:27.653,Exactly.
00:00:27.695,00:00:29.154,Otherwise known as Black Jack.
00:00:29.196,00:00:32.491,Flogged me twice in the space of a week.
00:00:32.533,00:00:36.161,"CLAIRE: The activities Dougal and his men were involved in, they were political."
00:00:36.203,00:00:38.747,Dougal was raising money for a Jacobite army.
00:00:39.748,00:00:41.249,Pleasure to see you again.
00:00:41.291,00:00:44.378,"Once more I ask you, is everything all right?"
00:02:19.974,00:02:22.810,"Tell me, madam."
00:02:33.695,00:02:39.827,"I appreciate your concern, Lieutenant, and I can assure you I am a guest of the Clan Mackenzie."
00:02:46.834,00:02:48.543,As you wish.
00:02:48.585,00:02:51.588,"Nevertheless, I am certain my commander will wish to speak with you."
00:02:51.630,00:02:53.381,He's presently in residence at the inn at Brockton.
00:02:53.423,00:02:54.633,Will you accompany me?
00:02:54.675,00:02:58.887,"Well, if the lady goes, I go."
00:03:00.931,00:03:02.474,Very well then.
00:03:12.609,00:03:18.239,"CLAIRE: Even though I wasn't going by my own choice, I still felt a heaviness leave my breast."
00:03:18.281,00:03:26.081,"And for the first time since I passed through the standing stones at Craigh na Dun, I found myself surrounded by my own people."
00:03:26.123,00:03:34.339,"They might be called Redcoats instead of Tommies, but they were still the British army I had been a part of for six long years."
00:03:34.381,00:03:42.014,And somehow it felt liberating to be looked upon with sympathy and respect instead of hostility and suspicion.
00:03:53.025,00:03:55.694,I knew only too well what Dougal was feeling.
00:03:57.571,00:04:07.873,"A Scottish village it may be, and on MacKenzie land at that, but for Dougal, it was now enemy territory, and he was the outlander."
00:04:38.612,00:04:39.821,Dismount.
00:04:39.863,00:04:41.156,Whoa.
00:04:44.284,00:04:46.745,Each man see to it that his horse is grained and watered.
00:04:46.787,00:04:48.288,I would not entrust their care to our Scottish hosts.
00:04:52.500,00:04:54.086,If you'll follow me.
00:05:09.268,00:05:11.895,"My Lord, may I present Mrs. Claire Beauchamp and Mr. Dougal..."
00:05:11.937,00:05:14.106,Come in. Come in.
00:05:15.023,00:05:17.442,This is a happy surprise.
00:05:17.484,00:05:19.486,A most enjoyable surprise.
00:05:19.527,00:05:24.449,It has been far too long since I last gazed upon a lovely English rose.
00:05:26.243,00:05:29.621,The lieutenant here claims you have quite the story to tell.
00:05:29.663,00:05:31.414,I'm so grateful you're willing to listen to it.
00:05:31.456,00:05:33.541,"No, nonsense."
00:05:33.583,00:05:37.462,I've not heard a good one since I first set foot upon this blasted turf.
00:05:37.504,00:05:39.798,You must be absolutely famished.
00:05:39.840,00:05:42.425,I hope venison is to your liking.
00:05:42.467,00:05:44.136,"Only the very best quality, I assure you."
00:05:44.178,00:05:45.720,Thank you.
00:05:45.762,00:05:47.222,I shot the beast myself.
00:05:47.264,00:05:49.683,"It's a great country for hunting, I'll give them that."
00:05:49.724,00:05:54.813,"The cheese is surprisingly edible too, and the claret is my own, bottled in '35."
00:05:54.855,00:05:56.231,Need I say more?
00:05:58.108,00:06:02.654,"Now, Lieutenant Foster, you're going to introduce me to this noble Scottish gentleman."
00:06:02.696,00:06:07.951,"My Lord, may I present Dougal MacKenzie, war chief to the Clan MacKenzie and brother to its laird."
00:06:07.993,00:06:13.790,"You have the honor of meeting Brigadier General Sir Oliver Lord Thomas, knight of the bath and commanding officer of the Northern British Army."
00:06:13.832,00:06:15.625,"War chief, eh?"
00:06:15.667,00:06:17.878,"I'll say this for you, you look the part."
00:06:17.919,00:06:20.297,"A fine specimen of the local inhabitants, My Lord."
00:06:20.339,00:06:21.756,"How am I to address you, sir?"
00:06:21.798,00:06:31.390,"Ye kin call me MacKenzie, if in it please ye, or if we're being formal, ye can call me Chief MacKenzie, which in matters of war and bicker leaves us ower fae each other as equals dinnae ye ken."
00:06:36.271,00:06:40.525,"I don't know about the rest of you, but I failed to understand a single word the creature said."
00:06:40.567,00:06:45.113,"I believe, My Lord, he was attempting to say Chief MacKenzie would be acceptable."
00:06:45.155,00:06:47.866,"There was more, but I must confess, it eluded me."
00:06:49.617,00:06:51.078,Really...
00:06:51.119,00:06:53.830,Someone really ought to teach these people the king's English.
00:06:55.623,00:06:57.292,"I believe he's speaking English, sir."
00:06:57.334,00:06:59.336,Their form of English anyway.
00:06:59.378,00:07:01.796,"Well, it's a form that's damn offensive to the ear."
00:07:01.838,00:07:05.384,"May I remind you, Lord Thomas, there are parts of England..."
00:07:05.424,00:07:07.177,Newcastle comes to mind.
00:07:07.219,00:07:12.015,Where the local accent is equally unintelligible to our ears.
00:07:12.057,00:07:13.641,"Yes, yes, quite right."
00:07:13.683,00:07:15.476,"You make a fine point, madam."
00:07:15.518,00:07:18.397,The world would make a lot more sense if everybody spoke like Londoners.
00:07:19.606,00:07:22.817,"If ye wish to hear Londoners speak, perhaps ye should have stayed in London."
00:07:27.989,00:07:30.533,"My Lord, he says..."
00:07:30.575,00:07:32.411,I understood him perfectly well that time.
00:07:37.416,00:07:43.422,"I would be more than happy to oblige, sir, if only you behaved like the loyal British subjects you're supposed to be."
00:07:43.463,00:07:47.050,That way my troops and I could return to more civilized environs.
00:07:59.062,00:08:02.232,"I must say though, I quite enjoy being a man in the field."
00:08:02.274,00:08:04.651,If only my servants moved as quickly as my soldiers.
00:08:06.527,00:08:08.571,"If I stay here long enough, I could become a laird."
00:08:08.613,00:08:10.031,Laird Thomas.
00:08:10.073,00:08:11.908,"What do you think, all?"
00:08:11.950,00:08:14.619,Only then I supposed I'd have to wear one of those woolen skirts.
00:08:14.661,00:08:19.874,"Oh, I'm told it's a grave insult to ask a clansman what he wears underneath that thing..."
00:08:21.168,00:08:23.420,"I know perfectly well what it's called, Lieutenant."
00:08:24.921,00:08:29.259,"So tell me, from one laird to another..."
00:08:29.301,00:08:33.263,"Are ye purposely trying to embarrass the lass, or are ye just an arrogant wee smout?"
00:08:33.305,00:08:35.682,"Good Christ, man."
00:08:35.723,00:08:37.684,"You watch your words, sir, or I'll have you."
00:08:37.725,00:08:39.519,"Well, you pull that needle, and we'll see who pricks who."
00:08:39.560,00:08:42.563,"Dougal, Lieutenant, enough."
00:08:46.276,00:08:47.861,"Yes, yes, quite right."
00:08:47.902,00:08:50.697,The lady's sense of propriety puts us all to shame.
00:08:50.738,00:08:53.700,The question of the kilt will remain an enigma.
00:08:56.077,00:08:58.538,"My word, madam."
00:08:58.579,00:09:01.958,"If I were brave enough, I would commission you a colonel in one of my regiments."
00:09:03.251,00:09:05.045,You do know how to order men about.
00:09:05.086,00:09:06.546,"Aye, she does that."
00:09:10.384,00:09:17.015,"Well, it's been a delight meeting you, but I am afraid the venison is losing its heat."
00:09:17.057,00:09:22.103,"I would ask you to join us, but as you can see, no room."
00:09:25.815,00:09:28.276,Beastly sorry.
00:09:30.611,00:09:32.947,They're still serving good Scottish ale in the tap room.
00:09:34.408,00:09:36.576,I'll be downstairs.
00:09:43.666,00:09:48.588,How are we ever going to make peace with such an ill-mannered people?
00:10:19.286,00:10:23.623,"I must say, Mrs. Beauchamp, you've had the most mesmerizing adventure."
00:10:32.840,00:10:34.801,"Oh, yes."
00:10:34.842,00:10:37.678,I would've thought you've had quite enough of Scotland.
00:10:37.720,00:10:47.522,"In truth, I found the countryside most beautiful, my stay not altogether unpleasant, but my greatest wish now is to be reunited with my family."
00:10:47.564,00:10:49.357,"Yes, yes."
00:10:52.402,00:10:59.075,"Lieutenant Foster, I imagine there'd be no difficulty in escorting Mrs. Beauchamp to Inverness, where she may book passage to wherever it pleases her to go."
00:10:59.117,00:11:01.286,"No difficulty at all, sir."
00:11:01.328,00:11:03.246,I would be forever grateful.
00:11:03.288,00:11:05.957,"It's a trifle, madam."
00:11:07.167,00:11:10.086,"Well, in that case, I will have a little bit more wine."
00:11:10.128,00:11:12.964,"Mmm, I believe we'll all join you."
00:11:19.095,00:11:27.145,"CLAIRE: Inverness, and from there only a brief journey would take me to the stones at Craigh na Dun and a chance to return to my own time."
00:11:28.938,00:11:31.316,To homeward journeys.
00:11:31.358,00:11:33.818,May they be uneventful.
00:11:33.860,00:11:35.654,"My Lord, are you aware that at this very moment..."
00:11:35.694,00:11:37.780,"Captain Randall, are we under attack, sir?"
00:11:37.822,00:11:39.698,We are not.
00:11:39.740,00:11:41.535,You're putting the claret at risk.
00:11:41.576,00:11:45.079,I suggest you step outside and rid yourself of half a league's worth of dust.
00:11:45.121,00:11:48.166,"By all means, we must protect the claret."
00:12:06.934,00:12:12.691,"For a moment there, the lady did look familiar, but..."
00:12:13.567,00:12:15.652,I can see now I was wrong.
00:12:16.653,00:12:19.906,I had the same exact experience.
00:12:20.865,00:12:21.991,How unusual.
00:12:30.458,00:12:32.544,Captain Jonathan Randall.
00:12:34.713,00:12:36.297,Captain.
00:12:37.298,00:12:38.757,Charmed.
00:13:00.905,00:13:05.619,I trust I am sufficiently presentable.
00:13:05.660,00:13:10.582,"Yes, yes, someone pour a glass for the good captain."
00:13:10.624,00:13:13.627,"Now, if you'll be so good as to explain your purpose for barging in here?"
00:13:13.668,00:13:20.799,"My Lord, at this very instant, Dougal MacKenzie, war chief of Clan MacKenzie is downstairs quaffing ale."
00:13:22.176,00:13:23.470,"That is not news, Captain."
00:13:23.511,00:13:25.722,It was he who brought Mrs. Beauchamp to us.
00:13:27.014,00:13:28.516,Was it indeed?
00:13:33.438,00:13:34.939,"Do you propose to admonish me, sir?"
00:13:36.691,00:13:39.986,Perhaps you're of the opinion that a general must explain himself to a captain.
00:13:41.488,00:13:42.905,"No, I meant no offense, sir."
00:13:43.906,00:13:53.500,"Now you mention it, an English lady and a Scottish war chief, I can't for the life of me piece that one together."
00:13:55.001,00:13:57.712,"Oh, it's a fascinating tale, Captain."
00:13:57.754,00:14:00.006,It's full of robbery and murder.
00:14:01.549,00:14:03.510,It's unfortunate you missed it.
00:14:05.345,00:14:07.430,I know.
00:14:07.472,00:14:10.057,What if Captain Randall accompanies you to Inverness?
00:14:10.099,00:14:12.769,That way you may regale him with tales of your adventure.
00:14:12.811,00:14:14.312,It's sure to make the time fly by.
00:14:14.354,00:14:18.316,Mrs. Beauchamp amongst the savages.
00:14:20.610,00:14:23.530,"Well, I doubt Mrs. Beauchamp would choose such a provocative title."
00:14:23.571,00:14:26.700,The lady claims she was well treated by her Scottish friends.
00:14:26.741,00:14:28.075,Hmm.
00:14:29.369,00:14:32.330,I wasn't aware that the English had any Scottish friends.
00:14:34.123,00:14:35.667,Hmm?
00:14:37.084,00:14:40.880,"I'm sure Private McGreavey would agree with me, if he were able."
00:14:45.092,00:14:47.637,Do not mention that sad subject.
00:14:49.764,00:14:51.683,You'll give Mrs. Beauchamp the vapors.
00:14:52.433,00:14:54.143,I do not easily swoon.
00:14:55.603,00:14:57.772,"Please, Captain, tell me."
00:14:58.939,00:15:03.444,"Two weeks ago, Private McGreavey made the mistake of wandering away from patrol."
00:15:03.486,00:15:09.868,"We found him two days later sitting, legs crossed, tied to a tree, his arms folded in his lap."
00:15:12.787,00:15:15.289,That sounds more like a prank than a punishment.
00:15:16.499,00:15:19.210,"He was cradling his severed head, madam."
00:15:24.549,00:15:28.553,It was a sad day for Private McGreavey when he got stationed to Scotland.
00:15:29.262,00:15:30.930,For all of us.
00:15:32.599,00:15:34.475,Is that all you have to say?
00:15:44.652,00:15:49.949,"On the road here yesterday, we came across two highlanders hanging from crosses."
00:15:51.951,00:15:55.246,The men in my party ascribed the actions to English soldiers.
00:15:55.288,00:15:58.917,"If so, then it would be the result of English justice."
00:15:58.958,00:16:00.919,"A rough justice, it would seem."
00:16:00.960,00:16:03.671,Undoubtedly traitors to a man.
00:16:03.713,00:16:08.802,"Yeah, so said the letters carved into their chests, but I doubt they were given a trial to prove it."
00:16:08.843,00:16:13.807,"Well, you can be sure that Private McGreavey's sentence was administered without benefit of trial."
00:16:13.848,00:16:17.936,And so both sides have committed depredations they should both be ashamed of.
00:16:17.977,00:16:21.815,"Dog me, that's a woman's view for you if ever I heard one."
00:16:21.856,00:16:26.444,That is why I make it a point never to discuss politics with a lady.
00:16:26.486,00:16:30.865,"I was under the impression we were discussing morality, not politics."
00:16:30.907,00:16:35.912,And I'm forced to question whether the lady's morality is any clearer than her politics.
00:16:37.580,00:16:38.832,"What are you implying, sir?"
00:16:40.541,00:16:48.925,"All this time living with savages, I have to wonder if Dougal MacKenzie shared more than just bread and shelter with the lady."
00:16:48.967,00:16:50.802,Perhaps he has also shared his bed.
00:16:50.844,00:16:52.762,How dare you?
00:16:52.804,00:16:54.514,That is a scurrilous charge.
00:16:54.555,00:16:55.890,"You cross a line, sir."
00:16:55.932,00:16:58.476,"If I am wrong, I apologize."
00:16:58.518,00:17:03.230,But what other reason would the lady have to choose these barbarians over her own people?
00:17:03.272,00:17:07.151,These aggressors who wantonly shed English blood?
00:17:07.193,00:17:10.029,The Scots just want the same freedoms we enjoy.
00:17:10.905,00:17:13.449,Freedoms we take for granted.
00:17:13.491,00:17:16.828,"They are not the aggressors, Captain, we are."
00:17:16.870,00:17:19.455,"It is their land, and we are occupying it."
00:17:33.970,00:17:37.932,"I must say, madam, I find your sympathies extraordinarily puzzling."
00:17:37.974,00:17:39.058,"Hear, hear."
00:17:41.936,00:17:46.190,"I can assure you, Lord Thomas, my loyalties lie with the king."
00:17:46.232,00:17:48.776,No doubt your time here has muddied your proper English thinking.
00:17:48.818,00:17:53.489,"My Lord, I think the lady has lived among the savages too long."
00:17:57.493,00:18:02.415,She must be returned to the bosom of her family as soon as possible.
00:18:02.456,00:18:05.209,"I could leave for Inverness today, if you will allow it."
00:18:10.506,00:18:15.053,"Sir, three enlisted men have been fired upon by persons unknown just outside of town."
00:18:15.094,00:18:19.306,Are these Scots rascals that bold to attack an armed British camp?
00:18:19.348,00:18:23.770,"My Lord, I know you've only recently arrived, but small ambushes are an almost weekly occurrence."
00:18:23.811,00:18:25.772,"Yes, thank you, Captain."
00:18:25.813,00:18:26.856,Any casualties?
00:18:26.898,00:18:28.399,One dead.
00:18:28.441,00:18:30.234,"One of the men, sir, he's in a bad way."
00:18:30.276,00:18:32.319,He's downstairs.
00:18:30.276,00:18:34.030,"We've sent for the surgeon, but no one is sure of his whereabouts."
00:18:34.072,00:18:36.783,I'll go.
00:18:36.824,00:18:38.826,I've told you.
00:18:44.874,00:18:46.125,I was right beside him.
00:18:46.166,00:18:47.919,Don't you see it could've been me?
00:18:47.961,00:18:50.046,Claire.
00:18:50.088,00:18:51.965,"Are ye all right, lassie?"
00:18:52.006,00:18:54.801,When I saw that bastard Randall go upstairs...
00:18:54.842,00:18:57.303,"Jamie and the others weren't responsible for this attack, were they?"
00:18:57.344,00:19:03.309,"No. I'll shed no tears over redcoat blood, but my men would never undertake such an action without my consent."
00:19:03.350,00:19:04.685,It's Randall ye need to worry about.
00:19:04.727,00:19:06.687,The army will be looking for someone to blame.
00:19:06.729,00:19:08.230,"Without proof, they can't hold me."
00:19:08.272,00:19:10.733,"Still, I'd feel better if you made yourself scarce."
00:19:11.901,00:19:13.277,I'm fine.
00:19:13.319,00:19:16.363,"Stand aside, and move this bench."
00:19:20.242,00:19:30.128,"CLAIRE: When the Germans surrendered, I thought I'd participated in my last amputation, but it seemed as though I was condemned to dream about yet more young men maimed for life on the battlefield."
00:19:30.169,00:19:31.629,This arm's going to have to come off.
00:19:31.671,00:19:33.547,You can have the loan of my short sword if it helps.
00:19:33.589,00:19:34.715,Sharpened it myself yesterday.
00:19:34.757,00:19:38.678,"It'll have to do, and I'm going to need to use something as a tourniquet."
00:19:38.719,00:19:40.096,You can tie his arm with this.
00:19:40.138,00:19:41.514,It's my wife's.
00:19:41.555,00:19:42.807,"Gave it to me for good luck, she did."
00:19:42.849,00:19:45.018,CLAIRE: All right.
00:19:45.059,00:19:47.645,Someone get me some boiling water and some clean cloth.
00:19:47.687,00:19:49.313,I'm the surgeon here.
00:19:49.355,00:19:50.690,Do you have medical experience?
00:19:50.731,00:19:53.233,Enough to know that you can't save this arm.
00:19:53.275,00:19:55.319,You're not going to faint when I begin to saw?
00:19:55.361,00:19:56.654,I've stayed awake through worse.
00:19:56.696,00:19:59.198,Grab his knees.
00:19:59.239,00:20:01.450,Opium.
00:20:05.830,00:20:07.665,"Bite, Private."
00:20:07.707,00:20:09.625,Bite until your teeth crack.
00:20:11.585,00:20:12.753,Steady now.
00:20:41.782,00:20:44.077,Nurse Beauchamp.
00:20:44.118,00:20:45.745,Are you back from saving lives?
00:20:47.872,00:20:49.165,Where's Lord Thomas?
00:20:49.207,00:20:53.711,"He's off hunting rebels, not that he'll find any."
00:20:54.712,00:20:57.757,"Having seen him on a horse, he'll be lucky to stay in the saddle."
00:20:57.798,00:21:01.135,"Please try not to speak, Captain."
00:21:01.177,00:21:03.763,My barbering skills aren't up to shaving a moving target.
00:21:05.848,00:21:08.601,I haven't been pampered like this since I was called up.
00:21:08.642,00:21:10.477,I should hope not.
00:21:10.519,00:21:14.232,"I'm the only one allowed to pamper you, and don't you forget it."
00:21:14.314,00:21:16.525,You'll get no argument from me.
00:21:16.567,00:21:20.947,I don't want you holding a blade to my throat.
00:21:20.988,00:21:24.366,A 200-year-old razor has certainly kept its edge.
00:21:24.408,00:21:27.245,"Well, it's not just the blade."
00:21:27.286,00:21:29.705,It's the beautiful hand that wields it.
00:21:30.831,00:21:32.959,Come here.
00:21:36.712,00:21:38.631,Are you sure you wouldn't rather bring this with you?
00:21:38.672,00:21:40.633,"What, and risk losing it?"
00:21:43.886,00:21:49.016,"No, I shall just have to suffer through a few more rough shaves till I see you again."
00:21:50.851,00:21:52.686,Can you keep it safe for me?
00:21:54.688,00:21:57.024,And who is going to keep me safe?
00:21:58.943,00:22:00.569,"Well, that is my job."
00:22:11.538,00:22:14.875,"I... I'm sorry, Captain."
00:22:14.917,00:22:17.253,"On my life, it was an accident."
00:22:17.295,00:22:19.088,On your life?
00:22:24.677,00:22:26.304,Sit down.
00:22:29.389,00:22:31.600,Otherwise he will never hit the target he aims at.
00:22:33.978,00:22:36.314,You control your nerves.
00:22:37.397,00:22:39.275,Your nerves do not control you.
00:22:43.737,00:22:47.825,"My, my, aren't we the beardless boy?"
00:22:52.705,00:22:58.376,"Take my things back to my lodgings, and come back and see to it that we are not disturbed."
00:22:58.418,00:23:00.087,"Yes, Captain."
00:23:10.388,00:23:12.892,I wish to see Lieutenant Foster.
00:23:12.933,00:23:17.230,I'm afraid Foster is gone with Lord Thomas and the others.
00:23:17.271,00:23:19.439,Then I suppose someone else will have to take me to Inverness?
00:23:22.400,00:23:23.401,When the time comes.
00:23:24.945,00:23:26.446,Lord Thomas said I would be leaving today.
00:23:28.532,00:23:31.118,And I wouldn't touch the general's claret.
00:23:31.160,00:23:35.455,"Perhaps you haven't noticed, but Lord Thomas is an utter arse."
00:23:37.375,00:23:42.420,He agreed to your leaving before he heard you make some of your more troubling statements.
00:23:43.714,00:23:45.966,Statements that...
00:23:46.008,00:23:51.429,"Well, even Lord Thomas is bright enough to realize puts your loyalty in a very questionable light."
00:24:06.862,00:24:08.572,Madam...
00:24:10.032,00:24:14.120,"Ever since our first encounter, I have been in a state of extreme discomfort."
00:24:16.163,00:24:20.334,"I am not sure what you mean, sir, nor am I sure I want to."
00:24:20.376,00:24:22.669,Allow me to put your fears to rest.
00:24:24.546,00:24:27.174,I wish to apologize.
00:24:27.216,00:24:28.675,That awful day in the woods...
00:24:31.220,00:24:32.763,Who are you?
00:24:34.765,00:24:36.934,The mere memory of it leaves me shamed.
00:24:40.438,00:24:43.232,Your apology pleases me more than you know.
00:24:43.274,00:24:47.987,I'd hate to think a king's officer would behave in such an ungentlemanly manner.
00:24:48.028,00:24:50.948,I am not a casual person with women.
00:24:50.990,00:24:59.497,"I look forward to the opportunity to reveal my true nature to you, and I can only hope that honesty will be met with honesty."
00:25:01.000,00:25:03.002,"My honesty will match yours, Captain."
00:25:05.712,00:25:07.465,Please.
00:25:24.148,00:25:30.612,Let us begin with you telling me who you are and why you're here in Scotland.
00:25:36.327,00:25:38.245,I originally come from Oxfordshire.
00:25:38.287,00:25:39.663,I...
00:25:39.705,00:25:42.540,"We pledged honesty, madam."
00:25:42.582,00:25:45.127,There are no Beauchamps in Oxfordshire that I know of.
00:25:45.169,00:25:49.547,"Well, I would hardly consider you an expert, your family hailing from Sussex."
00:25:51.591,00:25:53.677,May I ask just how you know that?
00:25:56.514,00:26:00.518,Your accent.
00:26:13.822,00:26:15.074,Parlez-vous francais?
00:26:17.659,00:26:19.370,"Oui, tres bien."
00:26:31.589,00:26:35.761,You don't have the look of a woman who would rouge her nipples.
00:26:38.431,00:26:41.267,"Well, for that, at least, I suppose I should thank you."
00:26:45.062,00:26:47.898,"What was your maiden name, Mrs. Beauchamp?"
00:26:51.402,00:27:03.205,"Captain, I admit I made some ill-advised comments in support of my Scottish acquaintances, but my imprudence should not be mistaken for treason, nor should it prevent me from continuing on my journey."
00:27:03.247,00:27:05.999,I have been delayed far too long already.
00:27:06.041,00:27:11.213,"Madam, you do not help your case by adopting this dismissive attitude."
00:27:11.255,00:27:13.924,I have no case to help.
00:27:13.966,00:27:18.137,"Now, I make no claims on you, the garrison, or on the MacKenzies for that matter."
00:27:18.178,00:27:23.225,"My only desire is to resume my journey in peace, and I see no reason why you should object to it."
00:27:23.267,00:27:24.642,Don't you?
00:27:26.562,00:27:32.650,"Well, allow me to enlighten you, and perhaps my objections will become clearer."
00:27:32.692,00:27:37.781,I found you wandering the countryside dressed in nothing but your undergarments.
00:27:37.823,00:27:54.381,"When I try to question you, I am struck down and rendered unconscious by a villain I later discover is a member of a band of Scottish rebels, a band led by your companion here today, Dougal MacKenzie."
00:27:55.924,00:28:02.680,These facts paint you either as an empty-headed trollop or as an agent in league with the king's enemies.
00:28:07.520,00:28:10.272,Are those my only two choices?
00:28:10.314,00:28:13.442,"If there is another, madam, I advise you not to keep it to yourself."
00:28:20.366,00:28:23.327,"Captain, you..."
00:28:23.369,00:28:27.456,Force me to reveal things that no woman should say out loud.
00:28:30.668,00:28:32.378,It was an affair of the heart.
00:28:34.672,00:28:36.714,I met him in England.
00:28:37.675,00:28:41.094,An officer of infantry.
00:28:41.136,00:28:44.723,He swore to me that I held his affections like no other.
00:28:48.185,00:28:52.189,"So when he was stationed in Scotland, I..."
00:28:52.231,00:28:54.233,I followed him.
00:28:59.446,00:29:01.740,Please. Carry on.
00:29:03.283,00:29:06.412,It was then I...
00:29:06.453,00:29:14.836,"Discovered he was a most licentious man, a rake and whoremonger."
00:29:14.878,00:29:17.756,It was not love he felt for me.
00:29:26.890,00:29:30.603,"When I refused him, he attacked me."
00:29:30.644,00:29:32.812,"I fled, dressed only in my shift."
00:29:44.742,00:29:52.999,I can only hope you prove yourself the gentleman you claim to be and not pry any further.
00:30:52.476,00:30:54.436,What is the man's name?
00:30:59.775,00:31:07.658,"With all due respect, Captain, I do not wish to lower myself to this gentleman's level."
00:31:09.993,00:31:19.753,"By revealing his name as well as his indiscretions to you, I risk ruining both his career and his reputation."
00:31:40.440,00:31:42.192,Please.
00:31:43.402,00:31:45.654,I would be interested in your opinion.
00:32:11.638,00:32:13.348,You captured my likeness.
00:32:13.390,00:32:15.308,You think so?
00:32:15.350,00:32:16.894,I'm glad.
00:32:18.353,00:32:21.690,I shall call it Beautiful Lies.
00:32:23.275,00:32:24.735,You wish to get to Inverness?
00:32:24.777,00:32:27.153,Very well.
00:32:27.195,00:32:30.699,I know that Dougal MacKenzie is raising funds for the Jacobite cause.
00:32:30.741,00:32:34.578,I merely lack the necessary proof to take him into custody.
00:32:34.620,00:32:36.789,You will furnish me with that proof.
00:32:39.666,00:32:49.927,Do not stand there and pretend that you have lived among the MacKenzies these past months and not heard them voice support for that failure James and his witless offspring Charles.
00:32:49.968,00:32:54.431,Mr. Mackenzie would have to be witless indeed to discuss treason in front of an English woman.
00:32:54.473,00:32:57.559,Unless that English woman was sympathetic to his cause.
00:32:58.769,00:33:00.019,I am not that woman.
00:33:00.061,00:33:02.021,Then prove it.
00:33:02.063,00:33:05.442,Have you seen any of your Scottish companions attempting to raise funds for the rebellion?
00:33:05.484,00:33:07.026,"No, I have not."
00:33:07.068,00:33:10.697,You've not heard a single MacKenzie speak Jacobite treason?
00:33:12.324,00:33:14.075,How many times must I say it?
00:33:16.787,00:33:22.668,I would not believe you if you told me that night is dark and day is bright.
00:33:22.709,00:33:24.753,"Captain, am I under arrest?"
00:33:24.795,00:33:29.883,"Because if not, then I refuse to submit further to this interrogation."
00:33:29.925,00:33:33.094,"I will await Lord Thomas' return, no matter how long it takes."
00:33:34.137,00:33:36.055,I place my fate in his hands.
00:33:36.097,00:33:39.559,"If you wish to put me under guard in the meantime, then I shall not protest."
00:33:47.066,00:33:52.906,You will not leave this room until I am satisfied that you are as innocent as you claim to be.
00:33:52.948,00:34:00.539,"Either you can cooperate with me, or I shall be forced to use methods less pleasant than talk."
00:34:00.580,00:34:03.416,"I've heard about your methods, Captain."
00:34:03.458,00:34:07.587,"What would you do, lay my back open to the bone?"
00:34:07.629,00:34:09.840,I understand flogging is something of a sport for you.
00:34:09.882,00:34:11.758,"Oh, on the contrary."
00:34:11.800,00:34:13.635,I take it very seriously.
00:34:13.677,00:34:18.390,I'm sure you'll be pleased to learn that you've earned quite the reputation at Castle Leoch.
00:34:20.433,00:34:26.606,"Yes, I'm told that you once administered a hundred lashes upon a hundred lashes to a poor highlander boy."
00:34:43.957,00:34:45.959,A poor highlander boy?
00:34:46.752,00:34:52.090,"If I take your meaning, that boy is a wanted thief and murderer."
00:34:53.299,00:34:55.802,I was told he'd merely stolen a loaf of bread.
00:34:56.929,00:34:59.056,Did Dougal MacKenzie tell you that?
00:34:59.097,00:35:00.849,Hmm?
00:35:03.476,00:35:04.978,He was there.
00:35:05.020,00:35:08.023,He witnessed it.
00:35:08.065,00:35:11.234,The thief had been flogged before for trying to escape.
00:35:11.276,00:35:22.412,"100 lashes administered by the corporal, a man not without skill in using the cat-o'-nine-tails, but the thief didn't break."
00:35:22.454,00:35:26.124,"No, he took his punishment without making a single sound."
00:35:27.834,00:35:39.471,"It set a bad example for the assembled onlookers, both soldiers and civilians, and I could not allow that insult to the crown to pass unchecked, so yes."
00:35:39.512,00:35:44.142,I decided that a further 100 lashes were in order.
00:35:45.769,00:35:47.270,Hurry up.
00:35:47.312,00:35:51.149,"This time, I would administer them myself."
00:36:11.753,00:36:15.007,I prefer to work on a blank canvas.
00:36:15.048,00:36:20.219,It makes one more able to mark the progress of the damage inflicted.
00:36:20.261,00:36:21.763,You're shaking.
00:36:22.848,00:36:24.182,Are you scared?
00:36:27.644,00:36:30.605,I'm just afraid I'll freeze stiff afore ye're done talking.
00:36:57.716,00:37:01.845,"Have you ever seen a man scourged, madam?"
00:37:29.581,00:37:31.208,I did...
00:37:31.249,00:37:37.672,I had intended to pace myself.
00:37:37.714,00:37:41.467,A hundred lashes is fatiguing to the arm.
00:37:59.402,00:38:04.241,"Again, the boy refused to cry out."
00:38:06.492,00:38:11.289,"I wonder, did he hope to stir me to pity?"
00:38:13.208,00:38:14.667,"If he did, he was sadly mistaken."
00:38:14.709,00:38:16.502,I was...
00:38:18.296,00:38:20.298,I was hurting him.
00:38:22.467,00:38:24.844,I could feel it.
00:38:26.554,00:38:33.937,"The sheer judder of the whip coursing up my arm, exploding into my heart..."
00:38:36.773,00:38:41.027,But the boy would not beg for mercy.
00:39:28.992,00:39:31.452,Look at me.
00:39:35.207,00:39:37.750,Is that enough?
00:39:54.017,00:39:56.228,And then something changed.
00:39:59.189,00:40:05.695,"One of my men fainted like a woman, and the crowd barked in laughter."
00:40:05.737,00:40:07.697,Silence!
00:40:07.739,00:40:13.411,I think it was in that moment that I determined to bleed him to the bone.
00:40:13.452,00:40:23.546,"The world suddenly narrowed down to my arm and his back, the whip connecting us both."
00:40:23.588,00:40:29.219,"The laughter changed, first to gasps, then to sobs."
00:40:34.099,00:40:37.435,"The crowd, they had to look away."
00:40:38.853,00:40:41.022,They were horrified.
00:40:47.737,00:40:49.572,Blind fools.
00:40:52.117,00:40:54.493,I think all they could see was the horror.
00:40:57.372,00:41:01.293,I... I could see the beauty.
00:41:07.966,00:41:09.634,I saw the truth.
00:41:11.970,00:41:14.597,That boy and I...
00:41:17.976,00:41:19.477,We were creating a masterpiece.
00:41:21.104,00:41:26.818,"An exquisite, bloody masterpiece."
00:41:36.911,00:41:39.831,It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
00:41:44.794,00:41:47.880,The truth carries a weight that no lie can counterfeit.
00:41:54.137,00:41:57.474,"I promised that I would reveal myself to you, and..."
00:42:01.060,00:42:02.937,I have.
00:42:03.938,00:42:05.606,Yes.
00:42:07.442,00:42:09.527,I believe you have.
00:42:11.529,00:42:13.448,"You think me a monster, no doubt."
00:42:15.116,00:42:16.868,It could be so.
00:42:27.212,00:42:33.134,The fact that you care what I think gives me some hope yet for your soul.
00:42:37.138,00:42:39.265,"I know one thing, madam."
00:42:41.393,00:42:43.395,I am not the man I once was.
00:42:45.897,00:42:52.195,"I came to Scotland to fulfill a soldier's responsibility, to serve my king, and protect my country."
00:42:53.112,00:42:54.739,Instead...
00:42:57.075,00:43:05.583,"I find myself the watchman of a squalid, ignorant people prone to the basest superstition and violence."
00:43:07.919,00:43:11.672,The darkness has grown within me.
00:43:12.924,00:43:17.595,A hatred for the very world itself.
00:43:20.139,00:43:32.818,"I find myself doing such things, reddish work, until I no longer recognize the man I have become."
00:43:40.159,00:43:43.621,You're not the first soldier to be changed by combat.
00:43:46.082,00:43:51.337,The fact that you can admit to it is yet another hopeful sign.
00:43:53.798,00:43:55.592,Of what?
00:43:58.010,00:44:08.605,"You say that buried within is a decent man, a man that can still choose right over wrong."
00:44:11.690,00:44:14.652,I believe that part of you lives still.
00:44:18.281,00:44:20.408,It would be pretty to think so.
00:44:25.746,00:44:33.505,"You cannot undo the things you've done, but it is not too late to win back your humanity."
00:44:33.546,00:44:36.674,You can choose to be the man you wish to be.
00:44:39.969,00:44:46.684,Do you think it possible that one day I might gaze upon my own reflection and not be filled with loathing?
00:44:48.102,00:44:57.529,I believe a man with your insight and self-knowledge can do whatever he wants.
00:45:00.573,00:45:03.409,The rehabilitation of Black Jack Randall.
00:45:05.911,00:45:08.705,You could make a fortune betting against that.
00:45:14.546,00:45:18.757,Perhaps I should begin by having you escorted to Inverness.
00:45:25.806,00:45:27.724,I've made you happy.
00:45:30.311,00:45:31.688,"Yes, you have."
00:45:36.275,00:45:37.985,An odd sensation.
00:45:46.743,00:45:48.413,I agree.
00:45:53.167,00:45:54.751,Corporal Hawkins.
00:45:58.047,00:46:00.717,Mrs. Beauchamp and I...
00:46:02.176,00:46:04.845,Require your assistance.
00:46:04.887,00:46:07.432,"Captain Randall, you have my deepest gra..."
00:46:19.277,00:46:23.114,"I dwell in darkness, madam, and darkness is where I belong."
00:46:23.155,00:46:26.117,"I need no sympathy from you, and you will get none from me."
00:46:27.993,00:46:32.206,"One way or the other, I will get the truth out of you."
00:46:39.672,00:46:41.798,Have you ever kicked a woman?
00:46:41.840,00:46:43.593,Sir?
00:46:45.511,00:46:48.805,It's... It's very freeing.
00:46:50.349,00:46:51.934,Come.
00:46:59.400,00:47:01.235,Kick her.
00:47:12.037,00:47:13.706,Kick her!
00:47:20.713,00:47:22.465,You see?
00:47:24.091,00:47:28.220,They're so soft.
00:47:32.391,00:47:34.101,Again.
00:47:40.483,00:47:42.985,I don't recall requesting your presence.
00:47:45.530,00:47:47.365,"Up ye come, lassie."
00:47:47.406,00:47:48.865,Ye're done here.
00:47:50.159,00:47:51.703,Hold!
00:47:55.247,00:47:56.999,I dinna come here to fight.
00:47:57.041,00:48:01.754,You tell yer wee laddies here to step aside before I lose my temper.
00:48:01.796,00:48:05.758,"You have no right to that woman, not while she's being questioned by a British officer."
00:48:05.800,00:48:07.844,She is a guest of Clan MacKenzie.
00:48:07.884,00:48:09.762,She is an English subject first.
00:48:09.804,00:48:13.140,And she was brought here for fear she was being held prisoner by my brother.
00:48:13.182,00:48:17.936,"Now she will have assured ye that that is not the case, and by right, must be returned to me for protection."
00:48:17.978,00:48:19.647,I'm afraid further questions have arisen.
00:48:19.689,00:48:22.024,"Oh, well..."
00:48:22.066,00:48:25.152,Ye won't be asking them on MacKenzie land.
00:48:25.194,00:48:28.740,"Not unless you want to start a war here, on this day."
00:48:39.876,00:48:42.253,I suppose we're done for the day.
00:48:42.294,00:48:46.048,Be sure to deliver her to Fort William by sundown tomorrow.
00:48:46.090,00:48:56.601,"If she is not present at the appointed time, you will be accused of harboring a fugitive from English law, and you'll be hunted down and punished, even unto death."
00:48:57.309,00:48:59.311,War chief or not.
00:49:02.398,00:49:03.982,Let them pass.
00:49:04.983,00:49:06.235,"Come on, lass."
00:49:09.196,00:49:11.948,"I look forward to our next meeting, Mrs. Beauchamp."
00:49:36.474,00:49:44.607,"CLAIRE: My body still reeling from mistreatment, the last thing I felt like was a headlong gallop through the rough terrain of the highlands."
00:49:44.649,00:49:48.486,I feared I was close to fainting when Dougal finally called for a halt.
00:49:48.527,00:49:50.279,Are we meeting the others here?
00:49:50.321,00:49:55.493,"No, they're back at the campsite, but there's fresh water nearby, and ye look like ye could use it."
00:49:55.534,00:49:56.619,Water? Where?
00:49:56.661,00:49:57.994,Down.
00:50:12.718,00:50:14.846,"Bit of a climb for a drink, is it not?"
00:50:19.183,00:50:20.726,"Oh, aye."
00:50:20.768,00:50:25.272,"There's a stink to it, but it will wet your thrapple sure enough."
00:50:39.745,00:50:42.373,How many times must I answer that same question?
00:50:42.414,00:50:45.543,"I promise, this is the last time I'll ever ask it of ye."
00:50:47.586,00:50:51.007,I am not a spy.
00:50:51.047,00:50:53.049,I am plain Claire Beauchamp and nothing more.
00:50:54.426,00:50:56.303,There.
00:50:56.345,00:50:57.763,Can we finally be done with it?
00:51:02.351,00:51:03.519,Well?
00:51:06.022,00:51:07.523,Aye.
00:51:07.565,00:51:09.567,Done it is.
00:51:11.360,00:51:13.779,Did you plan on using that on me?
00:51:13.821,00:51:15.322,I would no have liked it.
00:51:15.364,00:51:19.744,"Ye're a handsome woman, but if you proved false, I would have had no choice."
00:51:25.499,00:51:27.167,May I ask what convinced you?
00:51:28.293,00:51:30.295,St. Ninian's spring.
00:51:30.337,00:51:33.049,Some folk call it the liar's spring.
00:51:33.089,00:51:35.133,Smells like the fumes of hell itself.
00:51:35.175,00:51:40.096,"If you drink from that and you prove untrue, it'll burn your gizzard out."
00:51:43.601,00:51:44.977,A magic spring?
00:51:45.019,00:51:46.645,"Well, you're a healer."
00:51:51.609,00:51:54.110,"Well, I doubt Captain Randall would be so easily convinced."
00:51:55.404,00:51:57.197,Aye.
00:51:57.239,00:52:01.660,"Well, ye don't need to see him again."
00:52:02.954,00:52:05.121,Not if ye do what I tell ye.
00:52:06.874,00:52:09.293,Don't you have to bring me to fort William tomorrow?
00:52:09.334,00:52:21.722,"An English officer cannot compel a Scottish person, unless there is proof a crime has been committed, and even so, cannot force a Scottish subject from clan lands without permission from the laird concerned."
00:52:23.724,00:52:25.517,You've been talking to Ned Gowan.
00:52:25.559,00:52:27.853,"Aye, I have."
00:52:27.895,00:52:29.981,I thought it might come to this.
00:52:30.022,00:52:38.614,I can only legally refuse to hand ye back to Randall if I change ye from an Englishwoman to a Scot.
00:52:40.616,00:52:42.200,Into a Scot?
00:52:42.242,00:52:45.370,"Mmm, and the only way I can do that is for you to marry one."
00:52:47.247,00:52:49.291,No. Absolutely not.
00:52:49.333,00:52:50.751,I cannot do that!
00:52:50.793,00:52:52.086,Would ye rather go to an English prison?
00:52:55.673,00:52:57.549,So I'm to marry you?
00:53:00.636,00:53:09.269,"Well, I must admit the idea of grinding your corn does tickle me, but it's not myself I'd be nominating for the position."
00:53:10.562,00:53:12.188,Then who?
00:53:34.086,00:53:35.921,Dougal wants us to be married.
00:53:35.963,00:53:37.673,I know.
00:53:40.801,00:53:43.428,And you're willing?
00:53:43.470,00:53:47.223,"Well, ye've mended my wounds more than once."
00:53:49.185,00:53:51.520,I feel I owe ye something for all that.
00:53:51.562,00:53:55.691,"Besides, what kind of friend would I be if I left ye to that mad bastard Randall?"
00:54:02.198,00:54:05.826,But surely a young man like yourself...
00:54:05.868,00:54:09.245,"Well, isn't there someone else that you're interested in?"
00:54:11.165,00:54:14.334,"Oh, am I promised?"
00:54:16.754,00:54:18.547,No.
00:54:18.589,00:54:21.633,"No, I'm not much of a prospect for a wife."
00:54:21.675,00:54:24.595,"I mean, I've nothing more than a soldier's pay to live on."
00:54:24.636,00:54:27.223,Then there's the minor difficulty of a price on my head.
00:54:27.263,00:54:31.560,No father wants his daughter married to a man that might be arrested and hanged any time.
00:54:31.602,00:54:33.269,Did ye think of that?
00:54:36.982,00:54:39.275,So that's it then.
00:54:39.317,00:54:42.154,"As far as you're concerned, we can just start the honeymoon tomorrow?"
00:54:43.239,00:54:45.116,Aye.
00:54:45.157,00:54:47.283,Whatever suits ye.
00:54:50.579,00:54:53.040,"Well, doesn't it bother you that..."
00:54:55.584,00:54:57.293,That I'm not a virgin?
00:55:02.758,00:55:05.301,"Well, uh, no."
00:55:06.971,00:55:10.266,So long as it doesna bother you that I am.
00:55:15.813,00:55:18.314,I reckon one of us should ken what they're doing.
00:00:01.335,00:00:02.837,CLAIRE: Previously...
00:00:02.878,00:00:07.215,"JAMIE: Ye need not be scared of me, nor anyone else here, so long as I'm with you."
00:00:07.257,00:00:08.550,You're coming on the road.
00:00:08.592,00:00:11.094,I think it would be wise to have a healer along.
00:00:11.136,00:00:14.640,Have you seen any of your Scottish companions raise funds for the rebellion?
00:00:16.475,00:00:18.853,"Captain, I refuse to submit further to this interrogation."
00:00:22.314,00:00:24.316,"Now, she must be returned to me for protection."
00:00:24.358,00:00:26.360,I'm afraid further questions have arisen.
00:00:29.196,00:00:35.494,I can only legally refuse to hand you back to Randall if I can change you from an English woman to a Scot.
00:00:35.536,00:00:37.997,Dougal wants us to be married.
00:00:38.038,00:00:40.582,"Well, doesn't it bother you that I'm not a virgin?"
00:00:40.624,00:00:44.043,"No, so long as it doesna bother you that... I am."
00:02:32.820,00:02:34.154,Ready?
00:02:34.195,00:02:35.322,For what?
00:02:40.368,00:02:42.788,"PHOTOGRAPHER: Right, then, folks."
00:02:48.335,00:02:49.419,Why not?
00:02:50.587,00:02:52.089,What about your parents?
00:02:52.131,00:02:53.214,They've been waiting for us at the restaurant.
00:02:53.256,00:02:54.675,Let them wait.
00:02:55.884,00:02:57.594,"Frank, they've never even met me."
00:02:57.636,00:02:59.554,"Yeah, so?"
00:02:59.596,00:03:01.640,They'll never meet Claire Beauchamp.
00:03:02.975,00:03:07.395,I will have the pleasure of introducing them to Mrs. Frank Randall.
00:03:08.897,00:03:10.231,You... You're mad.
00:03:12.651,00:03:15.445,Are you sure you wouldn't rather a big church wedding or...
00:03:15.487,00:03:17.031,"No, no."
00:03:17.072,00:03:18.490,I'm sure.
00:03:19.992,00:03:27.166,"Darling, the only family I care about is you and the family that we will make together."
00:03:30.794,00:03:32.504,Will you marry me?
00:03:34.339,00:03:35.507,PRIEST: You may kiss yer bride.
00:03:51.815,00:03:54.275,CLAIRE: You forget your life after awhile...
00:03:56.361,00:03:59.031,The life you had before.
00:03:59.073,00:04:03.284,Things you cherish and hold dear are like pearls on a string.
00:04:05.704,00:04:11.376,"Cut the knot, they scatter across the floor, rolling into dark corners, never to be found again."
00:04:13.628,00:04:16.673,So you move on.
00:04:16.715,00:04:19.718,And eventually you forget what the pearls even looked like.
00:04:22.971,00:04:24.723,Or at least you try.
00:04:39.362,00:04:41.573,Sounds like the wedding party is still going strong.
00:04:43.033,00:04:45.285,Don't suppose they're going to bed anytime soon.
00:04:49.414,00:04:51.416,No.
00:04:51.458,00:04:53.752,Not until they know we've made things official.
00:04:58.173,00:05:00.550,Should be grateful they didn't want to watch.
00:05:00.592,00:05:02.302,Only Rupert and Angus.
00:05:03.720,00:05:05.055,A wee joke.
00:05:08.016,00:05:09.977,You're a regular Bob Hope.
00:05:10.018,00:05:11.686,Was he a funny man?
00:05:15.232,00:05:16.984,I always thought so.
00:05:27.452,00:05:35.919,"To a lady of grace, a woman of strength, and a bride of astonishing beauty."
00:05:38.172,00:05:39.338,My wife.
00:05:41.133,00:05:43.426,Claire Fraser.
00:06:31.390,00:06:33.434,"You needn't be afraid of me, Claire."
00:06:33.476,00:06:35.645,I wasna planning to suddenly force myself on you.
00:06:38.190,00:06:40.192,Never thought you would.
00:06:46.781,00:06:48.950,I have questions.
00:06:48.992,00:06:51.370,"Ah, I suppose you do..."
00:06:52.996,00:06:54.706,Under the circumstances.
00:06:57.792,00:06:59.418,What is it you want to know?
00:07:01.713,00:07:03.131,"Well, I, um..."
00:07:04.841,00:07:06.593,What the hell.
00:07:06.634,00:07:08.427,Might as well come straight out with it.
00:07:09.804,00:07:11.431,Why did you agree to marry me?
00:07:14.268,00:07:17.354,"I mean, Dougal didn't give me much of a choice, but you..."
00:07:17.396,00:07:20.899,"Well, I..."
00:07:20.941,00:07:22.692,We do not have much time.
00:07:22.734,00:07:27.197,Captain Randall is expecting Mistress Beauchamp to be delivered to him tomorrow.
00:07:27.239,00:07:33.661,"Now, we are all about to embark on a boat built entirely of paper."
00:07:33.703,00:07:38.083,The letter of the law is the only thing keeping Claire out of Randall's hands.
00:07:38.125,00:07:42.379,"And so if it is to work, then we have to follow it to the letter."
00:07:42.421,00:07:50.178,The marriage must be consummated right away and witnesses must swear that they were present in the building if not in the room itself.
00:07:51.263,00:07:52.472,Does Claire know about all this?
00:07:52.513,00:07:54.975,She has no say in the matter.
00:07:55.016,00:07:56.851,"I thought you didn't hold with rape, Dougal."
00:07:56.893,00:07:59.020,No rape.
00:08:00.230,00:08:02.690,She's a smart lass.
00:08:02.732,00:08:12.284,"She'll see the reason for it in the end, but there can be no secret agreements between the two of ya, you saying that you have when you have not."
00:08:12.326,00:08:18.498,"Besides, I can think of worse things in my lifetime than holding onto that sweet pair of ciochan, plunging my cock..."
00:08:20.459,00:08:25.172,"If Claire does become my wife, I'll thank you to stop talking and thinking of her like some common whore."
00:08:25.630,00:08:27.299,Hey! If?
00:08:28.508,00:08:30.135,"There is no if about this, laddie."
00:08:30.177,00:08:36.099,"Now, she took a few blows at the hands of Randall and kept silent, which is a fair sight more than I'd expect of any ordinary woman."
00:08:36.141,00:08:37.476,But you know Randall.
00:08:37.517,00:08:39.227,You know what he's capable of.
00:08:39.269,00:08:42.439,What do you think'll happen to her if she falls into his hands again?
00:08:48.945,00:08:50.571,So you married me to keep me safe.
00:08:52.782,00:08:53.992,Aye.
00:09:03.460,00:09:09.549,"You have my name, my clan, my family."
00:09:11.510,00:09:15.638,"And, if necessary, the protection of my body as well."
00:09:53.301,00:09:55.345,Tell me about your family.
00:10:02.936,00:10:05.313,How many generations back?
00:10:06.856,00:10:08.608,Your parents will do.
00:10:08.649,00:10:09.776,Aye.
00:10:11.278,00:10:14.197,My father was a Fraser.
00:10:18.910,00:10:23.331,A younger half-brother to the present master...
00:10:23.373,00:10:25.917,Colum and Dougal...
00:10:28.336,00:10:30.547,Colum wished my mother to marry Malcolm Grant.
00:10:30.589,00:10:34.259,"My Aunt Janet is dead, like my mother, but my Aunt Jocasta..."
00:10:34.301,00:10:36.928,I had my father see me grow up.
00:10:36.970,00:10:38.179,I was always grateful for that.
00:10:38.221,00:10:43.768,"CLAIRE: It was a distraction, to be sure, but a welcome one for both of us."
00:10:43.810,00:10:49.232,"When he told me his family history, I reciprocated in kind..."
00:10:49.274,00:10:53.694,And we each spent the next several hours drinking and talking and...
00:10:53.736,00:10:57.031,Generally getting to know our new spouses for the first time.
00:11:05.081,00:11:08.376,"CLAIRE: He was charming, a born storyteller, like most Scots."
00:11:08.418,00:11:10.378,She told Malcolm Grant off.
00:11:11.671,00:11:13.840,And he headed home as a result.
00:11:13.881,00:11:19.095,"CLAIRE: As the hours passed, I began to relax and eventually to enjoy myself."
00:11:19.137,00:11:20.679,And your mother?
00:11:20.721,00:11:26.603,She and my father slipped out of the castle right under the noses of 300 clansmen.
00:11:28.605,00:11:30.607,And my father loved telling that story.
00:11:38.657,00:11:40.367,"I told you to stand back, ye coof ye!"
00:11:40.408,00:11:42.701,"I wasn't gonna ponce around outside the door, was I?"
00:11:42.743,00:11:44.579,Waiting for them to answer...
00:11:44.621,00:11:46.581,Like we were just coming by for a nice cup of tea.
00:11:46.623,00:11:47.915,And just what are you doing?
00:11:47.957,00:11:50.043,"Dougal sent us up to see if ye'd, uh..."
00:11:51.545,00:11:53.672,Y'ken?
00:11:53.712,00:11:55.006,They've still got their clothes on.
00:11:55.048,00:11:57.175,Get out.
00:11:57.217,00:11:58.677,"I know that, but not on your wedding night!"
00:12:06.643,00:12:08.687,They're related to you?
00:12:08.727,00:12:10.021,Rupert only.
00:12:12.691,00:12:14.150,Distant cousin.
00:12:25.537,00:12:26.996,It's getting rather late.
00:12:27.038,00:12:29.040,Perhaps we should go to bed?
00:12:32.085,00:12:33.211,To bed...
00:12:35.213,00:12:36.548,Or to sleep?
00:12:39.092,00:12:40.301,Well...
00:12:48.476,00:12:52.230,Either way you're...
00:12:53.607,00:12:55.900,I'll help you with the...
00:12:55.942,00:12:57.611,The laces and such.
00:13:11.666,00:13:12.791,Ah.
00:13:28.224,00:13:29.601,Skirts first.
00:13:30.393,00:13:31.478,Aye.
00:15:14.622,00:15:16.123,It's my turn.
00:15:52.159,00:15:53.994,Where did you learn to kiss like that?
00:15:56.706,00:15:58.499,I said I was a virgin...
00:15:59.375,00:16:00.627,Not a monk.
00:16:01.711,00:16:04.672,If I need guidance...
00:16:17.852,00:16:19.979,Uh... Oh...
00:16:29.989,00:16:32.992,"Jamie, you're crushing me."
00:17:40.309,00:17:42.436,So was it like you thought it would be?
00:17:46.649,00:17:47.901,Almost.
00:17:51.445,00:17:52.739,I thought...
00:17:53.948,00:17:56.450,"No, never mind."
00:17:57.159,00:17:59.078,What? Tell me.
00:18:00.538,00:18:02.081,You'll laugh at me.
00:18:06.544,00:18:08.462,"Promise, I won't laugh."
00:18:20.516,00:18:24.478,"I thought you must do it the back way, you know, like..."
00:18:27.481,00:18:29.776,I'm sorry.
00:18:29.817,00:18:31.778,"I know, I promised I wouldn't laugh."
00:18:33.112,00:18:34.488,I'll ask you a question.
00:18:35.489,00:18:37.075,Of course.
00:18:37.116,00:18:38.618,Did you like it?
00:18:42.789,00:18:43.873,Huh.
00:18:44.999,00:18:46.084,Hmm.
00:18:47.334,00:18:49.128,"Murtagh was right about that, then."
00:18:50.212,00:18:51.255,Murtagh?
00:18:53.049,00:18:55.134,He said women generally do not care for it.
00:18:56.844,00:18:58.888,"Well, he and Rupert."
00:19:00.306,00:19:02.016,And Ned.
00:19:02.058,00:19:04.644,They offered a lot of advice on the subject last night.
00:19:21.119,00:19:22.912,"I did like it, Jamie."
00:19:33.840,00:19:36.342,CLAIRE: There it was.
00:19:42.849,00:19:44.017,I need to get some food.
00:19:44.058,00:19:46.060,"Claire, wait."
00:19:46.978,00:19:48.855,"Claire, wait!"
00:19:49.814,00:19:51.149,Hey!
00:19:54.068,00:19:58.531,"Hey, lass, if you're still able to walk, Jamie isna doing his duty by ye!"
00:19:58.572,00:20:03.536,"If she's worn out already, Jamie, I'll be more than happy to fill your place."
00:20:06.288,00:20:09.125,Bit of a curse and give us peace.
00:20:09.167,00:20:11.711,"Better go back inside, sassenach."
00:20:11.752,00:20:13.754,"Until they've had their fun, they'll no leave us alone."
00:20:28.061,00:20:31.772,"Oh, Jamie, how was your first time?"
00:20:31.814,00:20:33.941,Did ye bleed?
00:20:33.983,00:20:37.111,"No, but you will, you bugger, if ye dinna haud yer wheesht."
00:20:37.153,00:20:41.199,"Hey, while you're filling your face, maybe I'll go upstairs and fill mine, hey?"
00:20:41.240,00:20:43.534,Maybe...
00:20:46.245,00:20:48.164,"All right, lads, show's over."
00:20:48.206,00:20:49.874,Dinna need to stay up any longer.
00:20:49.916,00:20:51.375,"Aye, but let's hope you do."
00:20:53.586,00:20:56.338,Why don't you buy yourself a wedding night like Ned did?
00:20:56.380,00:20:58.257,It's the only way he'll ever get one.
00:20:58.632,00:21:00.885,Thank you.
00:21:00.927,00:21:02.762,DOUGAL: Don't think ye've thanked me properly.
00:21:05.681,00:21:09.602,For finding you somewhere better to stick yer cock than the fillies in the stable.
00:21:12.354,00:21:14.314,Thank you.
00:21:19.904,00:21:23.074,You don't want to appear too keen to return to your...
00:21:24.200,00:21:25.618,Your bride.
00:21:28.037,00:21:29.329,CLAIRE: Did he really say that?
00:21:29.371,00:21:34.085,"Aye, he said, You never want to let a woman see you're too eager to please her."
00:21:34.127,00:21:35.711,Gives her too much power.
00:21:37.755,00:21:39.006,Really?
00:21:40.549,00:21:42.301,And what did you have to say to that?
00:21:45.304,00:21:48.682,I said I was completely under yer power and happy to be there.
00:21:58.692,00:22:00.486,Is there any more whiskey?
00:22:18.587,00:22:19.755,Thank you.
00:23:03.674,00:23:05.383,What does that mean?
00:23:06.927,00:23:08.554,My brown-haired lass.
00:23:11.932,00:23:13.600,"Rather a dull color, brown, I've always thought."
00:23:13.642,00:23:15.435,No.
00:23:19.565,00:23:22.860,It's like the...
00:23:19.565,00:23:26.404,"The water in a burn, the way it ruffles down the rocks."
00:23:34.914,00:23:38.542,Wee bits of auburn when the sun touches it.
00:23:56.060,00:23:57.811,See a new kilt for the occasion.
00:23:59.355,00:24:00.480,Aye.
00:24:02.024,00:24:03.483,The Fraser colors.
00:24:07.487,00:24:08.864,Where did you get it?
00:24:12.993,00:24:16.038,Huh.
00:24:16.080,00:24:17.539,Did it cost you dear?
00:24:17.581,00:24:19.125,It cost nothing but time and conversation.
00:24:20.876,00:24:25.214,The clothes belonged to the husband of a Fraser widow about five miles from here.
00:24:25.256,00:24:27.300,Died about 10 years ago.
00:24:27.341,00:24:30.844,I wager she talked the poor bugger into an early grave.
00:24:32.305,00:24:34.265,She wants them back by tomorrow night.
00:24:34.307,00:24:36.976,Why?
00:24:37.017,00:24:39.477,I almost didn't bring the damn things back to you anyway.
00:24:39.519,00:24:40.896,The village is crawling with redcoats.
00:24:40.938,00:24:43.190,I'm well aware.
00:24:43.232,00:24:45.943,Otherwise I'd be collecting my own wedding clothes.
00:24:45.985,00:24:52.032,And what do you think would happen when you prance out of here with your red hair and your muckle size wearing Fraser colors?
00:24:53.617,00:24:56.162,You might as well paint a target on your back.
00:24:58.538,00:25:00.958,"I plan to be wed but one time, Murtagh."
00:25:03.585,00:25:07.589,So I'll do so in a way that would make my mother proud.
00:25:10.259,00:25:11.469,Hud.
00:25:16.890,00:25:18.642,What do you make of her?
00:25:19.352,00:25:21.020,Mistress Beauchamp.
00:25:22.562,00:25:23.730,She'll do.
00:25:26.650,00:25:28.652,I think my mother would have approved.
00:25:32.572,00:25:34.450,"Do I look like a gypsy to you, huh?"
00:25:35.451,00:25:37.535,Able to commune with the spirits?
00:25:49.340,00:25:50.799,Have you still got your brooch?
00:26:06.190,00:26:08.025,Your mother had the sweetest smile.
00:26:09.776,00:26:12.154,Would warm a man to the backbone just to see it.
00:26:22.915,00:26:24.083,Here.
00:26:31.798,00:26:33.384,CLAIRE: Murtagh said that?
00:26:34.009,00:26:35.635,Ha.
00:26:35.677,00:26:38.556,I wouldn't have expected anything quite so romantic.
00:26:40.682,00:26:43.102,"Still waters run deep, ye ken?"
00:26:46.230,00:26:48.606,Is he a Fraser or a MacKenzie?
00:26:51.318,00:26:54.363,Murtagh Fitzgibbons Fraser.
00:26:58.367,00:27:01.745,I'm surprised Dougal waited for him to go get your kilt.
00:27:03.581,00:27:05.082,He was in such a hurry.
00:27:05.124,00:27:07.293,"He was, but I slowed him down."
00:27:10.463,00:27:11.713,I'll do it.
00:27:15.384,00:27:18.887,But I have three conditions.
00:27:18.929,00:27:21.265,"Ah, Christ, it would be easier if I kill ye both."
00:27:21.307,00:27:23.392,Much harder to explain.
00:27:23.434,00:27:26.562,"First, we must be wed properly."
00:27:28.063,00:27:29.440,In a church.
00:27:31.066,00:27:32.485,Before a priest.
00:27:38.115,00:27:40.242,Half past 10:00.
00:27:38.115,00:27:42.244,And this one still burrowing under his blankets.
00:27:42.286,00:27:44.330,"Oh, Christ, father!"
00:27:44.371,00:27:46.664,Did I no just tell you to aim it off to the side?
00:27:46.706,00:27:48.708,There'd be no problem if he had left me in my bed.
00:27:48.750,00:27:53.380,"We only need your services for an hour, then you can coorie back doon under your blankets."
00:27:53.422,00:27:56.800,He says he won't do it.
00:27:56.842,00:28:00.554,I said I canna perform a wedding until after the banns have been read.
00:28:00.596,00:28:01.847,But that would take three weeks.
00:28:01.888,00:28:03.474,We don't have three days.
00:28:03.516,00:28:05.184,Then I won't be performing your wedding.
00:28:10.230,00:28:13.275,"I have a knife, too, and I'm no afraid to use it."
00:28:13.317,00:28:15.569,"I believe we have you outnumbered, father."
00:28:15.611,00:28:18.113,"Aye, but neither of ye a priest."
00:28:19.448,00:28:22.909,"Kill me, and you have no one for miles around to perform a wedding."
00:28:24.911,00:28:31.460,"Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation and to doctrine."
00:28:31.502,00:28:35.297,"1 Timothy, chapter 4, verse 13."
00:28:35.339,00:28:43.263,"Church doctrine says before there can be any wedding, the names of the contracted parties must be publicly announced three times on three consecutive..."
00:28:43.305,00:28:45.391,"Look, you dozy smout..."
00:28:48.352,00:28:52.105,Yer not under the law...
00:28:53.649,00:28:54.941,Romans 6:14.
00:28:58.237,00:29:01.907,"If you'd learned your catechism from Father Bain, you'd ken your Bible verses, too."
00:29:01.948,00:29:05.536,"Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine."
00:29:05.578,00:29:12.626,"Continue in them, for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee."
00:29:12.668,00:29:16.963,"1 Timothy, chapter 4, verse 16."
00:29:17.005,00:29:22.969,"Be not forgetful to entertain strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares."
00:29:25.055,00:29:26.806,You're mixing up the verses.
00:29:26.848,00:29:28.767,"Well, ye canna do that."
00:29:31.811,00:29:33.855,It's colder than a witch's tit in here.
00:29:33.897,00:29:38.277,"Ye'll perform the ceremony tomorrow, banns or no, or you'll be performing your last rite."
00:29:38.318,00:29:40.654,"Go ahead, kill me."
00:29:40.696,00:29:47.077,"Even if I burn in the fiery pit, it'd be better than spending one more Sunday in this miserable freezing box."
00:29:51.998,00:29:54.084,How would you like your own proper windows?
00:29:56.169,00:30:02.926,Dougal said that the wee man barely skipped a beat before asking what time we would like the ceremony to begin.
00:30:02.968,00:30:05.011,"Church and money, some things don't change."
00:30:05.053,00:30:06.096,Mmm.
00:30:13.687,00:30:15.689,What was your next condition?
00:30:15.731,00:30:19.109,"If ye'd have let me finish the game, I woulda won us a proper ring."
00:30:19.151,00:30:22.821,"Well, this is what Jamie wants, and since it's his wedding, this is what he'll get."
00:30:25.324,00:30:26.784,Good day to you.
00:30:26.825,00:30:28.327,Good day.
00:30:28.368,00:30:30.537,Are you the blacksmith?
00:30:30.579,00:30:32.831,"Of course he's the blacksmith, ye great gob."
00:30:36.001,00:30:37.586,We... We want a ring made.
00:30:37.628,00:30:40.088,A wedding ring.
00:30:40.130,00:30:41.840,Can you do it?
00:30:42.758,00:30:44.092,I suppose.
00:30:44.134,00:30:45.427,I've got some silver in the back.
00:30:45.469,00:30:46.928,No. Make it from this.
00:30:50.641,00:30:51.933,It's a perfectly good key.
00:30:51.975,00:30:53.435,It would be a shame to melt that down.
00:30:53.477,00:30:54.687,"Oh, dinna melt it down."
00:30:54.728,00:30:56.855,The groom wants you to keep the...
00:30:58.357,00:31:03.862,The part that goes into the lock and... The...
00:31:05.197,00:31:07.324,Part on the other end.
00:31:07.366,00:31:09.034,The blade and the bow.
00:31:09.075,00:31:12.788,"Aye, the blade and the bow."
00:31:15.541,00:31:16.709,It can be done.
00:31:16.750,00:31:17.959,Next week.
00:31:19.169,00:31:20.879,Today.
00:31:21.797,00:31:23.382,Gie him the money.
00:31:33.600,00:31:34.643,All right.
00:31:35.686,00:31:37.730,Ye said ye'd pay half.
00:31:37.771,00:31:39.481,"I would have, had you not taken me out of the game."
00:31:39.523,00:31:40.733,CLAIRE: A key.
00:31:46.363,00:31:47.740,Key to what?
00:31:49.616,00:31:50.909,Nothing.
00:31:53.036,00:31:55.831,It was just something I had in my sporran.
00:31:58.375,00:31:59.918,What was your third condition?
00:32:03.129,00:32:04.715,I left that to Ned.
00:32:04.757,00:32:06.508,What about this one?
00:32:07.760,00:32:09.469,"Mistress, please."
00:32:09.511,00:32:11.430,"I'm here to find a dress, not a woman."
00:32:11.471,00:32:12.723,I like this one.
00:32:12.765,00:32:14.474,This one's my favorite color.
00:32:14.516,00:32:16.184,Do you like it?
00:32:16.226,00:32:18.270,Look what it does at the back.
00:32:18.311,00:32:19.772,It laces up.
00:32:19.813,00:32:21.732,"Do you want this one, then?"
00:32:23.233,00:32:27.112,Wouldn't you like to take me out of this one?
00:32:30.449,00:32:32.826,The... The bride isn't a...
00:32:32.868,00:32:35.704,A woman of loose morals?
00:32:35.746,00:32:40.083,She's a...
00:32:40.125,00:32:44.838,Then mebbe ye shouldn't be shopping for a dress at a whorehouse.
00:32:44.880,00:32:46.089,WOMAN: I hae something might suit ye.
00:32:47.090,00:32:49.175,"Get back, back now."
00:32:49.217,00:32:51.845,Or I'll clout your ears for ye.
00:32:51.887,00:32:55.724,Courtesy of a certain lord with whom we are familiar.
00:32:55.766,00:32:59.227,His lordship bought it in London for his lady.
00:32:59.269,00:33:08.361,"On his way home, he lost the rest of his money at the tables in Stirling, so when he came by us for his usual visit, he was long on desire but a wee bit short on clink."
00:33:09.362,00:33:10.989,He proposed a trade and I accepted.
00:33:11.531,00:33:13.325,Never been worn.
00:33:13.366,00:33:19.372,"Was waiting for a gentleman to visit before putting it on, but I suppose it's best I never did."
00:33:19.414,00:33:22.835,No lass should wear another woman's dress on her wedding day.
00:33:22.876,00:33:25.420,"Well, that'll do nicely."
00:33:26.421,00:33:28.006,Cost ye a schilling.
00:33:29.925,00:33:31.635,"Fine, fine, fine."
00:33:36.974,00:33:40.393,"Oh, must you run off straight away?"
00:33:40.435,00:33:43.772,It will take the girls a few minutes to wrap it up.
00:33:43.814,00:33:46.191,"Protect it from the weather, ye ken?"
00:33:46.232,00:33:49.862,Perhaps we could offer ye some entertainment in the meantime?
00:33:56.493,00:33:59.120,Come on.
00:33:59.162,00:34:01.874,Not too fast.
00:34:01.915,00:34:03.750,"Oh, come on."
00:34:03.792,00:34:08.338,"No, I told it to you exactly as Ned told it to me."
00:34:10.007,00:34:15.094,Grinning like a dog with twa tails and beaming red the whole time.
00:34:18.557,00:34:20.517,"Oh, so that's who that was."
00:34:20.559,00:34:22.561,I had no idea that all that was going on.
00:34:22.602,00:34:24.062,That's right.
00:34:25.480,00:34:27.399,Ye've not told me what you were doing all day.
00:34:38.660,00:34:42.414,"Hey, on your feet, lass."
00:34:42.455,00:34:45.124,You hardly wanna get married looking like a melted candle.
00:34:46.292,00:34:47.794,Like a what?
00:34:48.545,00:34:50.005,"Oh, God."
00:34:50.047,00:34:53.675,"So, do ye no remember anything of your own wedding?"
00:34:53.717,00:34:55.761,"As a matter of fact, I do."
00:34:57.679,00:34:59.264,"I did have a monstrous hangover, though."
00:35:03.351,00:35:06.271,"JAMIE: I remember every moment, every second."
00:35:09.983,00:35:14.112,I'll never forget when I came out of the church and saw you for the first time.
00:35:16.322,00:35:22.579,It was as if I stepped outside on a cloudy day and suddenly the sun came out.
00:36:22.764,00:36:24.390,"Your servant, madam."
00:36:36.736,00:36:38.321,I can't marry you.
00:36:40.157,00:36:41.533,I don't even know your real name.
00:36:44.327,00:36:45.578,It's Fraser.
00:36:47.914,00:36:54.212,James Alexander Malcolm Mackenzie Fraser.
00:36:57.298,00:36:59.217,Claire Elizabeth Beauchamp.
00:37:11.897,00:37:13.940,"Well, if you two are quite finished..."
00:37:14.900,00:37:16.401,Let's get on with it.
00:37:19.863,00:37:22.240,So you don't remember any of this?
00:37:23.825,00:37:29.081,"CLAIRE: Not all of it, but some things are very clear."
00:37:52.896,00:38:09.621,"I, James Alexander Malcolm Mackenzie Fraser take, thee, Claire Elizabeth Beauchamp, to be my wedded wife, to have and to hold from this day forth, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health..."
00:38:09.662,00:38:12.040,Till death us do part.
00:38:12.082,00:38:25.262,"I, Claire Elizabeth Beauchamp take, thee, James Alexander Malcolm Mackenzie Fraser to be my wedded husband."
00:38:28.223,00:38:29.724,To have and to hold from this day...
00:38:29.766,00:38:31.434,In sickness and in health...
00:38:34.271,00:38:36.148,Till death us do part.
00:38:38.150,00:38:39.484,Do you have the ring?
00:38:39.525,00:38:40.526,Aye.
00:38:58.295,00:38:59.337,Amen.
00:39:31.953,00:39:33.579,Say the words after me.
00:39:39.252,00:39:42.547,CLAIRE: What exactly did the words mean?
00:39:42.588,00:39:45.258,JAMIE: You are blood of my blood and bone of my bone.
00:39:48.887,00:39:51.806,I give you my body that we two may be one.
00:39:56.394,00:39:57.937,I give you my spirit...
00:40:02.234,00:40:04.027,Till our life shall be done.
00:40:05.528,00:40:07.405,You may kiss yer bride.
00:40:37.643,00:40:44.692,"When you kissed me like that, well, maybe you weren't so sorry to be marrying me after all."
00:41:03.128,00:41:04.462,Take off your shirt.
00:41:06.214,00:41:08.091,I want to look at you.
00:42:21.414,00:42:22.748,"Well, then..."
00:42:25.001,00:42:26.544,Fair is fair.
00:42:53.946,00:42:55.614,Have you never seen a naked woman before?
00:42:57.534,00:43:00.495,"Aye, but not one so close."
00:43:08.294,00:43:10.046,And not one that's mine.
00:43:29.357,00:43:30.649,Ah!
00:43:52.130,00:43:55.216,Ah... Ah... Oh!
00:43:55.258,00:43:56.634,I'm sorry.
00:44:01.473,00:44:02.640,You didn't.
00:44:04.476,00:44:05.726,You sure?
00:44:08.980,00:44:10.398,Yes.
00:44:13.776,00:44:15.694,I dinna know women could...
00:44:18.364,00:44:19.782,Does it happen every time?
00:44:23.661,00:44:25.622,Only if the man is a very good lover.
00:44:42.888,00:44:45.891,What are you doing?
00:44:52.315,00:44:55.360,Does that hurt?
00:44:56.152,00:44:57.654,Do you want me to stop?
00:44:58.988,00:45:00.448,No.
00:45:00.948,00:45:02.200,No.
00:45:59.298,00:46:00.757,What did you say?
00:46:03.344,00:46:06.222,I thought my heart was gonna burst.
00:47:11.828,00:47:13.122,DOUGAL: Mrs. Fraser.
00:47:19.253,00:47:21.714,You're out late.
00:47:21.756,00:47:24.258,I'm just back from seeing Captain Randall.
00:47:24.300,00:47:27.136,I shared with him the happy news that you're no longer at his beck and call.
00:47:29.305,00:47:30.889,What did he say?
00:47:35.520,00:47:38.897,I don't suppose he means to take any further steps about it?
00:47:38.939,00:47:40.441,I shouldn't think so.
00:47:40.483,00:47:46.823,"He's got more important things to worry about than chasing after one stray sassenach, no matter how pretty."
00:47:46.863,00:47:49.866,And he's got better sense than to rile colum by kidnapping his nephew's wife.
00:47:51.619,00:47:54.163,That's comforting to know.
00:47:54.205,00:47:56.374,I commend you for doing your duty.
00:48:01.253,00:48:03.840,But it needn't stop you from sampling other pleasures.
00:48:07.259,00:48:09.886,"I find you to be the most singular woman, Claire."
00:48:13.932,00:48:15.518,I'm Jamie's wife.
00:48:28.740,00:48:30.907,"Evening, mistress, Dougal."
00:48:30.949,00:48:32.702,"Good evening, Rupert."
00:48:35.079,00:48:38.915,I would like to thank you for your kindness towards me.
00:48:40.042,00:48:42.002,The... The ring is magnificent.
00:48:42.044,00:48:44.756,"Oh, well, you're welcome."
00:48:44.797,00:48:47.884,And a most hearty congratulations to you on your wedding day.
00:48:50.344,00:48:51.679,Thank you.
00:48:54.849,00:49:00.145,"Ah, young Jamie may no have much experience, but that one looks like well ridden."
00:49:00.688,00:49:01.773,Ooh!
00:49:02.607,00:49:04.149,What was that fer?
00:49:04.191,00:49:06.151,Check the horses.
00:49:06.819,00:49:08.070,Do it again.
00:50:11.467,00:50:13.051,They're Scotch pearls.
00:50:17.515,00:50:18.975,They belonged to my mother.
00:50:20.100,00:50:21.769,And now they belong to my wife.
00:50:30.277,00:50:33.238,They're one of the few things I have left of her.
00:50:36.032,00:50:37.994,And very precious to me.
00:50:41.079,00:50:42.748,"As are you, Claire."
00:52:19.845,00:52:21.806,I'll meet you downstairs.
00:52:21.847,00:52:25.059,"If I don't get something to eat soon, I might have to take a bite out of you."
00:52:25.101,00:52:27.352,I believe you've already done that.
00:52:27.394,00:52:29.063,And I look forward to doing it again soon.
00:52:29.105,00:52:30.522,Don't be long.
00:52:30.564,00:52:32.274,There'll be nothing left but crumbs.
00:00:01.168,00:00:03.587,My husband.
00:00:03.629,00:00:06.799,Nothing you could ever do could stop my loving you.
00:00:06.841,00:00:09.593,"Jonathan, Jonathan Wolverton Randall, finally."
00:00:15.683,00:00:17.977,as Black Jack.
00:00:18.018,00:00:20.896,of a place called Craigh na Dun.
00:00:22.606,00:00:25.860,I was no longer in the 20th century.
00:00:25.901,00:00:27.402,What was Frank going through?
00:00:30.197,00:00:31.907,Perhaps I was abducted.
00:00:33.993,00:00:35.536,Perhaps I was dead...
00:00:38.914,00:00:44.628,"Or perhaps, worst of all, I had left him for another man."
00:02:32.069,00:02:35.196,"Inverness police, constable Boyle speaking, how may I help you?"
00:02:36.448,00:02:37.616,Uh-huh.
00:02:37.658,00:02:39.618,I see.
00:02:40.995,00:02:43.163,When did you first notice the items were missing?
00:02:47.835,00:02:49.168,He's back.
00:02:50.087,00:02:52.047,"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph."
00:02:53.340,00:02:55.759,I think today's the day.
00:02:55.801,00:02:56.969,"Today, sir?"
00:02:57.011,00:02:58.679,I have let this go on long enough.
00:02:59.554,00:03:01.180,"Today, Sergeant."
00:03:12.734,00:03:14.903,Good luck.
00:03:16.488,00:03:18.740,I'm gonna send a man over straightaway.
00:03:27.875,00:03:33.130,"Mr. Randall, you know, I'm very, very sorry."
00:03:33.964,00:03:39.011,Please believe me when I say I wish there was more that we could do.
00:03:39.053,00:03:43.724,"Well, there's your job, perhaps you could do that."
00:03:45.976,00:03:48.187,I know this must be disappointing to you.
00:03:48.228,00:03:50.397,Disappointing?
00:03:50.438,00:03:52.941,That's an interesting word.
00:03:52.983,00:03:55.903,It suggests expectations that were unmet.
00:03:57.571,00:04:06.121,"My expectations of your department were, were low to begin with, and I can assure you that you have met those expectations at every turn."
00:04:18.092,00:04:19.634,"Invested over 1,000 man hours."
00:04:19.676,00:04:25.182,"I know the litany detective, but tell me, what do you have to show for these, for these efforts?"
00:04:29.937,00:04:31.063,My wife has disappeared.
00:04:35.650,00:04:39.947,Do you have any idea at all what might have happened to her?
00:04:42.532,00:04:44.743,We haven't found a body.
00:04:44.785,00:04:46.954,"Now, that tells me that she's probably still alive."
00:04:46.995,00:04:54.419,"No blood in the car, no sign of a struggle, now, that tells me that she probably wasn't taken against her will."
00:04:55.336,00:04:56.588,"Yeah, your favorite theory."
00:04:57.589,00:05:03.262,You personally witnessed a man staring up at her window the night before she disappeared.
00:05:03.303,00:05:07.766,I have said from the very beginning that the Highlander is certainly involved in some way.
00:05:07.808,00:05:10.811,"Of course he's involved, you fool."
00:05:10.852,00:05:14.231,"He's her lover, and the two of them left together."
00:05:14.273,00:05:16.483,My wife is not with another man.
00:05:42.717,00:05:44.178,Ask you a question?
00:05:45.512,00:05:46.596,Of course.
00:05:50.017,00:05:53.187,"Well, my question, I don't wish to, that is..."
00:05:54.855,00:06:02.696,"I don't mean to imply that you have some vast knowledge of men, but well, you know more than I do in such matters."
00:06:02.737,00:06:04.156,Out with it.
00:06:09.203,00:06:18.837,"Is it usual, what it is between us when I touch you, when you lie with me?"
00:06:20.672,00:06:24.343,Is it always so between a man and a woman?
00:06:31.225,00:06:34.228,It's often something like this.
00:06:41.400,00:06:45.613,"No, this isn't usual."
00:06:48.742,00:06:50.244,It's different.
00:07:25.112,00:07:26.654,-Friend of yours?
00:07:27.281,00:07:29.324,"Hugh, Hugh Munro."
00:07:30.951,00:07:31.993,Hi.
00:07:35.247,00:07:37.249,I was here?
00:07:43.297,00:07:45.299,"Aye, saw Dougal and the others watering the horses?"
00:07:45.340,00:07:47.008,-Aye.
00:07:48.551,00:07:49.761,Oh?
00:07:49.803,00:07:53.014,"Her. Claire, my wife."
00:07:53.640,00:07:54.641,Oh.
00:07:56.559,00:07:58.437,Married but these two days.
00:08:07.237,00:08:11.283,"Says he's got news, but insists we drink to you first."
00:08:11.325,00:08:12.575,Canna say I disagree.
00:08:32.762,00:08:33.847,"Oh, how kind."
00:08:39.644,00:08:41.021,This is beautiful.
00:08:41.688,00:08:42.856,It's a dragonfly.
00:08:44.691,00:08:45.692,Thank you.
00:08:47.486,00:08:49.612,"-Gone official, have you?"
00:08:49.654,00:08:51.948,Or are these just for when the game is scarce?
00:08:51.990,00:08:54.534,-What are they?
00:08:55.202,00:08:56.619,Gaberlunzie tokens.
00:08:57.704,00:08:59.998,"They're licenses to beg, Sassenach."
00:09:00.040,00:09:02.625,They're good within the borders of a single parrish.
00:09:03.251,00:09:05.170,Single parrish?
00:09:05.212,00:09:06.671,About a dozen by my count.
00:09:08.340,00:09:12.093,"Aye, well, Munro's a special case, you see."
00:09:12.135,00:09:14.429,He was captured by the Turks at sea.
00:09:14.471,00:09:17.182,Spent a good many years as a slave in Algiers.
00:09:17.224,00:09:19.559,That's where he lost his tongue.
00:09:21.728,00:09:23.063,Cut it out?
00:09:29.194,00:09:32.531,boiling oil on his legs.
00:09:32.572,00:09:36.868,It's how they forced captive Christians to convert to Mussulmen religion.
00:09:46.378,00:09:48.255,Said you came wi' news.
00:09:48.629,00:09:50.173,Ah.
00:09:55.303,00:09:56.388,Who?
00:10:00.808,00:10:01.935,Why would he know?
00:10:06.147,00:10:07.274,Can he be trusted?
00:10:13.738,00:10:14.781,What's his name?
00:10:16.991,00:10:18.410,Ha...harack.
00:10:19.286,00:10:20.537,Harack?
00:10:22.205,00:10:23.290,Horrock.
00:10:25.750,00:10:27.001,Horrocks.
00:10:29.796,00:10:32.173,When and where does this Horrocks want to meet?
00:10:40.474,00:10:41.600,All right.
00:10:47.688,00:10:50.775,"Thank you, thank you kindly, Hugh."
00:11:02.662,00:11:07.250,There's a chance to get the price lifted from my head.
00:11:07.292,00:11:08.918,There's a witness who can prove my innocence.
00:11:10.170,00:11:16.301,"Claims he was there during my escape from Fort William, saw who actually killed the Sergeant."
00:11:16.343,00:11:19.846,But I'm not sure I can trust him.
00:11:19.887,00:11:22.265,-Is this Horrocks?
00:11:19.887,00:11:24.309,"-Aye, a redcoat deserter."
00:11:53.880,00:11:56.174,the Findhorn river?
00:11:56.216,00:11:57.884,Did you tell them?
00:11:59.469,00:12:01.720,"They, uh, they weren't interested."
00:12:01.762,00:12:04.391,"It's a theory, a good one."
00:12:05.392,00:12:15.276,"She leaves Craigh na Dun, gets lost, turns back, tries to follow the Findhorn river, takes a misstep, and then is swept away by the current, all the way down to the Darnaway Forest."
00:12:15.318,00:12:18.238,Darnaway Forest is 20 miles from where the car was found.
00:12:18.279,00:12:22.033,"Ah, the river is fast, and it was swift that night."
00:12:22.075,00:12:25.495,She could've been carried twice that far.
00:12:25.537,00:12:28.164,"These maps of the area, they're poor."
00:12:28.206,00:12:35.880,"Looks as though there are bends in the river here where she might have made it to shore, and then found shelter along this ridge, maybe, maybe in a cave."
00:12:35.922,00:12:38.966,"So she's tired, she's lost, she doesn't know where to turn."
00:12:39.008,00:12:45.306,"So she hunkers down in this cave to keep warm, and lives on fish and frogs while waiting to be found."
00:12:45.348,00:12:47.517,Fish and frogs for seven weeks?
00:12:47.559,00:12:49.436,She relied on her army survival training.
00:12:49.477,00:12:51.396,She's a strong woman.
00:12:51.438,00:12:52.564,We're grasping at straws.
00:12:52.606,00:12:54.023,Gentlemen...
00:12:55.525,00:12:57.652,-Tea is served.
00:12:57.694,00:12:59.778,"Oh, thank you, Roger."
00:12:59.820,00:13:02.240,"May I have a biscuit, please?"
00:13:02.282,00:13:04.701,another biscuit? Aye.
00:13:04.743,00:13:06.869,"Have you been eating all my biscuits, Roger Wakefield?"
00:13:08.413,00:13:10.415,"Now, go upstairs, and get ready for bed."
00:13:10.457,00:13:13.084,I'll be up in a minute to read you a story.
00:13:38.943,00:13:41.946,I think I need something a little stronger.
00:13:41.988,00:13:43.030,Care for some company?
00:13:43.072,00:13:45.158,"No, thank you."
00:14:07.180,00:14:08.598,What can I get you?
00:14:12.435,00:14:14.853,"Evening, Mr. Randall."
00:14:18.775,00:14:21.986,"You can call me Sally, but that's not my real name."
00:14:28.868,00:14:30.203,"What can I do for you, Sally?"
00:14:31.621,00:14:33.373,It's what I can do for you.
00:14:46.302,00:14:47.512,I ken where he is.
00:14:51.558,00:14:52.726,Where?
00:14:52.767,00:14:53.934,Close.
00:14:56.103,00:14:57.230,I'll take you to him.
00:14:58.898,00:15:01.025,Not now.
00:15:01.067,00:15:02.318,There's too many eyes and ears in here.
00:15:04.654,00:15:09.701,"Meet me on Drummond lane, just past the cobbler shop at 12:30."
00:15:09.743,00:15:11.745,Come alone and bring the reward.
00:15:14.497,00:15:16.040,Is he with her?
00:15:19.836,00:15:20.920,I don't know.
00:15:22.756,00:15:24.257,All I can do is take you to where he is.
00:15:24.298,00:15:26.008,"After that, it's your concern."
00:15:26.050,00:15:27.677,"Remember, 12:30."
00:15:40.565,00:15:42.567,Another.
00:15:42.609,00:16:10.887,"carries the builder straight into the water, and down through the depths to his own cold, fishy home, then he tells the builder if he would be free, he must build a fine house, and a muckle chimney as well, so that the waterhorse's wife could warm her hands by the fire and fry her fish."
00:16:14.515,00:16:25.151,"And the builder, having little choice, did as he was bid, because the waterhorse's wife was sad, and cold, and hungry in her new home beneath the waves."
00:16:29.739,00:16:33.159,Be Yuletide by the time we get back to Leoch.
00:16:37.204,00:16:39.081,Christmas...
00:16:39.123,00:16:41.668,I don't suppose you hang stockings by the fire.
00:16:42.836,00:16:44.044,"To dry them off, you mean?"
00:16:45.338,00:16:46.923,Never mind.
00:16:46.965,00:16:58.643,"waterhorse's wife was warm then, and happy, and full of the fish she fried for her supper, but when the man came down to the..."
00:16:58.685,00:16:59.978,What's the matter?
00:17:00.019,00:17:02.021,"The horses, they're restless."
00:17:03.564,00:17:04.649,Someone's near.
00:17:07.234,00:17:10.279,"Now, don't move."
00:17:10.321,00:17:13.950,the murky waters below.
00:17:13.992,00:17:24.084,"And the waters of the east end Loch Garve never freeze over, because the heat from the waterhorse's chimney melts the ice."
00:17:26.546,00:17:28.923,"When I say, go to it and don't move."
00:17:32.051,00:17:33.386,Take this.
00:17:37.557,00:17:47.191,"beneath the waves has but fish's teeth and feeds on snails and water weeds and cold, wet things."
00:17:47.233,00:17:52.947,His blood runs cold as water -and has no need of fire.
00:17:52.989,00:17:54.490,Mind the wagon!
00:18:03.165,00:18:04.625,Get off!
00:18:13.051,00:18:14.677,They're going for the grain and the horses.
00:18:45.291,00:18:46.459,"Come on, ye!"
00:18:48.294,00:18:49.921,Come on!
00:18:57.428,00:18:59.138,Claire!
00:18:59.179,00:19:01.015,I'm all right.
00:19:03.309,00:19:04.769,Who were those men?
00:19:04.811,00:19:06.270,The grants.
00:19:06.312,00:19:07.855,Did they take anything?
00:19:07.897,00:19:10.441,"A horse, three bags of grain, but none of the money."
00:19:10.483,00:19:12.110,-A horse?
00:19:13.653,00:19:15.947,"-Are you all right, Willie?"
00:19:15.989,00:19:19.492,Did you see that shot?
00:19:54.527,00:19:58.031,"Mr. Randall, I was starting to think you weren't gonna show."
00:19:58.072,00:19:59.657,I believe I'm on time.
00:20:13.337,00:20:14.421,Here.
00:20:19.677,00:20:20.928,Where?
00:20:24.974,00:20:26.433,Give us the reward.
00:20:43.117,00:20:44.451,Stop!
00:20:44.493,00:20:45.661,"Stop, please!"
00:20:53.586,00:20:54.921,No! No!
00:20:55.462,00:20:56.714,No!
00:20:56.756,00:20:58.424,No! No!
00:21:04.097,00:21:05.431,There is no Highlander is there?
00:21:06.140,00:21:07.349,Is there?
00:21:07.391,00:21:09.102,"No, no!"
00:21:18.111,00:21:33.333,"in this modern age to dismiss the idea of good and evil, but there is evil, and it finds purchase in good men by giving sin the sweet taste of ecstasy."
00:21:35.628,00:21:41.175,"The Nazis drank from that poisoned cup, thinking all the while they were slaking their thirst with the sweetest wine."
00:21:41.217,00:21:43.970,Are you suggesting that I have been drinking from the same cup?
00:21:44.637,00:21:46.472,Evil has but one cup.
00:21:47.181,00:21:49.183,They drank long and deep.
00:21:49.850,00:21:51.644,Yours was but a sip.
00:21:52.812,00:21:54.480,Make it your last.
00:21:55.773,00:21:59.735,"Turn away from the darkness that beckons you, and go back into the light."
00:22:00.653,00:22:02.446,You mean leave Inverness.
00:22:07.326,00:22:09.287,Go back to Oxford.
00:22:09.328,00:22:11.289,You start your life over.
00:22:15.417,00:22:17.170,And what of Claire?
00:22:17.211,00:22:20.923,"Let her go, just as she has let you go."
00:22:28.014,00:22:32.518,So you believe that she left with the Highlander of her own volition?
00:22:36.939,00:22:39.525,"Have you ever read Sherlock Holmes, Frank?"
00:22:44.322,00:22:52.746,"One point he makes, when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."
00:23:10.181,00:23:11.349,It just slipped out of my hand.
00:23:12.975,00:23:15.019,-Found it.
00:23:23.277,00:23:25.403,It's too long and heavy for me.
00:23:25.445,00:23:27.198,Lasses say that to me all the time.
00:23:27.240,00:23:31.202,You gave her a knife and you didn't show her how to use it.
00:23:34.080,00:23:39.126,"-Aye, Angus, you're a good man with a blade."
00:23:39.168,00:23:41.545,"Uh, thank you all the same, but I think I'll be fine."
00:23:41.587,00:23:46.592,"Every man and woman in the world needs to know how to defend themselves, Sassenach, especially those married to a Fraser."
00:23:48.094,00:23:50.554,I become more aware of that every day.
00:23:50.596,00:23:52.223,Lass needs a Sgian Dubh.
00:23:53.473,00:23:54.641,A what?
00:23:56.852,00:24:03.276,"them in their socks, but I, I keep mine in a rather more private place."
00:24:05.361,00:24:07.863,"Now then, who needs a lesson?"
00:24:10.532,00:24:13.035,"Mostly, you want to use the underhand."
00:24:13.077,00:24:20.584,Overhand is only good if you're coming down on someone else with a considerable force from above ye.
00:24:20.626,00:24:23.379,I still say the only good weapon for a woman is poison.
00:24:23.421,00:24:26.464,"Perhaps, but it has certain deficiencies in combat."
00:24:27.216,00:24:28.301,All right.
00:24:29.885,00:24:32.346,So where do I aim my Sgian Dubh?
00:24:32.388,00:24:35.849,"If you're killing face to face, here."
00:24:36.892,00:24:40.146,"Aim straight up, and then, as hard as you can into the heart."
00:24:41.439,00:24:44.442,"Uh-oh, avoid the breast bone."
00:24:44.482,00:24:49.322,"You get your knife stuck in that soft part on the top, you'll be without a knife."
00:24:51.449,00:24:54.285,"So, right there?"
00:24:54.327,00:24:56.203,"Whoa, dinnae kill him yet, mistress."
00:24:56.245,00:24:57.913,Wait 'til the lesson's over.
00:25:00.624,00:25:02.335,"Willie, give us a hand."
00:25:04.586,00:25:07.256,"Turn around, so I can show how to kill from behind."
00:25:09.633,00:25:13.304,"Now, this is the spot in the back."
00:25:13.346,00:25:14.972,Either side will do.
00:25:15.014,00:25:16.765,"Now, you see where all the ribs and such?"
00:25:16.807,00:25:19.393,-Mmm-hmm.
00:25:16.807,00:25:22.438,-Very difficult to hit anything vital when you stab in the back.
00:25:22.480,00:25:25.399,"Slip the knife between the ribs, uh?"
00:25:25.441,00:25:27.151,That's one thing.
00:25:27.193,00:25:29.236,A lot harder to do than ye might think.
00:25:30.612,00:25:32.281,"Here, here."
00:25:33.407,00:25:38.871,"Just under the last rib, you stab upward, and into the kidney."
00:25:40.080,00:25:42.333,-Straight up.
00:25:42.375,00:25:43.501,They'll drop like a stone.
00:25:47.545,00:25:48.839,All right.
00:25:48.881,00:25:50.424,Straight up...
00:25:50.466,00:25:51.675,And in.
00:25:56.472,00:25:57.890,"See, got it."
00:27:08.043,00:27:09.587,Won't they come looking for us?
00:27:10.546,00:27:13.132,I told Dougal we need to find some more of your wee herbs.
00:27:14.425,00:27:16.135,"This is my idea, is it?"
00:27:17.052,00:27:18.596,And did he believe you?
00:27:26.437,00:27:29.022,"Does it ever stop, the wanting you?"
00:27:52.421,00:27:55.048,Now I know why the church calls it a sacrament.
00:27:57.551,00:27:58.636,Why?
00:28:00.804,00:28:03.307,Because I feel like God himself when I'm inside ye.
00:28:04.850,00:28:06.226,What?
00:28:06.268,00:28:08.728,Is that a foolish thing to say?
00:28:08.770,00:28:10.481,You're laughing at me.
00:28:10.523,00:28:13.150,"Yes, I most certainly am."
00:28:13.192,00:28:14.860,And you'll get what you deserve.
00:28:25.371,00:28:27.914,you rutting bastard.
00:28:34.838,00:28:37.216,"You might ha' let him finish first, Harry."
00:28:37.257,00:28:39.468,"Stoppin' in the middle, now that's bad for a man's 'ealth."
00:28:39.510,00:28:42.388,"Oh, his 'ealth's no concern of mine."
00:28:44.764,00:28:49.019,"Well, kill him, and be done with it then, 'cause I've a mind to take a piece o' that."
00:28:56.776,00:28:58.237,Think I'll let 'im watch first.
00:28:59.279,00:29:01.073,"You like that, you Scottish whoreson?"
00:29:03.617,00:29:10.165,"Take a good look, laddie-buck, see how it's done, 'cause I'll have your slut moaning for more before the hour is done."
00:30:11.477,00:30:14.647,"my tongue for weeks now, and I'll be silent no longer."
00:30:14.688,00:30:16.690,You cannot tell him this fantasy of yours.
00:30:16.732,00:30:18.984,"I know what I know, and I won't pretend that I don't."
00:30:19.025,00:30:24.323,"What you know is a bunch of dribble-drabble and nonsense, and I will not have it paraded about as fact."
00:30:24.364,00:30:27.534,He has a right to hear it and make up his own mind.
00:30:34.583,00:30:35.668,Oh...
00:30:37.169,00:30:38.796,It's an old house.
00:30:38.837,00:30:41.465,"-Is there something you wish to tell me, Mrs. Graham?"
00:30:42.800,00:30:44.884,There is.
00:30:44.926,00:30:48.888,"Even if it should cost me my position, I feel I must tell you the truth."
00:30:48.930,00:30:51.308,-The truth...
00:30:55.604,00:30:58.607,There is another explanation for what happened to your wife.
00:31:01.860,00:31:04.363,The stories are old.
00:31:04.404,00:31:12.371,"Some say as old as the stones themselves, passed down from generation to generation through ballads and songs."
00:31:13.539,00:31:17.125,"I first heard them from my grandmother, and she from hers."
00:31:18.627,00:31:21.087,The songs tell stories about people who...
00:31:22.548,00:31:24.132,Travel through the stones.
00:31:25.300,00:31:27.093,Travel through stone?
00:31:29.221,00:31:30.806,I'm not sure I take your meaning.
00:31:32.599,00:31:35.352,Not literally through the stone itself.
00:31:35.394,00:31:37.521,You see...
00:31:37.563,00:31:40.232,The circle at Craigh na Dun marks a...
00:31:40.940,00:31:44.820,A place on the Earth where the powers of nature come together.
00:31:44.862,00:31:47.072,Superstition and twiddle-twaddle.
00:31:50.283,00:31:51.451,Go on.
00:31:59.626,00:32:09.052,"And for certain people, on certain days, it allows them to pierce the veil of time."
00:32:11.555,00:32:15.726,"Mr. Randall, you know your wife went up that hill the day she vanished."
00:32:15.768,00:32:20.188,"I believe she didn't come back down that hill, at least not in 1945."
00:32:21.481,00:32:25.903,I believe that she traveled to some other time.
00:32:34.912,00:32:38.624,"Where or, when would that be?"
00:32:39.374,00:32:41.084,I don't know.
00:32:41.126,00:32:43.712,Every traveler is different.
00:32:43.754,00:32:52.888,"They must make their own journey on their own path, but the songs do say that the travelers often return."
00:32:56.433,00:32:57.601,I see.
00:33:11.030,00:33:12.324,Did ye no hear me?
00:33:12.365,00:33:14.284,-Mrs. Graham.
00:33:14.326,00:33:15.535,I did hear you.
00:33:16.912,00:33:19.164,I simply do not share your beliefs.
00:33:20.999,00:33:22.334,Forgive me.
00:33:38.725,00:33:40.560,Sorry.
00:33:41.353,00:33:42.521,I'm so sorry.
00:33:44.022,00:33:45.732,It's all right.
00:33:45.774,00:33:47.192,We're all right.
00:33:47.233,00:33:49.611,My fault.
00:33:49.653,00:33:52.364,"To bring you here without taking proper heat, and to let you be..."
00:33:54.574,00:33:56.201,To not stop him.
00:33:57.536,00:33:58.829,It's all right.
00:34:00.580,00:34:04.668,"And here, you're so cold."
00:34:14.511,00:34:15.595,-It's shock.
00:34:15.637,00:34:16.680,We heard a shot.
00:34:17.639,00:34:19.265,I'm going into shock.
00:34:20.058,00:34:21.601,-Jamie.
00:34:26.523,00:34:28.233,I'm going into shock.
00:34:32.404,00:34:37.576,"and danced from thought to thought, like a stone skipping across a pond."
00:34:38.577,00:34:52.507,"My parents, men I'd seen die, the smell of uncle Lamb's cigarettes, Errol Flynn swinging on a rope, the feeling of my dagger tip puncturing the kidney."
00:34:57.178,00:35:14.404,"I knew he was worried about me, knew he wanted to talk about what had happened, but I knew if I did, if I started giving rein to my feelings, things would pour out of me that I wanted to keep locked away forever."
00:35:14.446,00:35:16.448,It's shock.
00:35:16.489,00:35:18.617,It's all right.
00:35:19.284,00:35:20.410,It's all right.
00:35:24.163,00:35:26.792,"The tracks lead back over the ridge, no horses."
00:35:27.584,00:35:28.668,Good.
00:35:29.711,00:35:31.337,Your man Horrocks...
00:35:31.379,00:35:33.506,Munro said he's a deserter like these.
00:35:34.466,00:35:36.927,"Hey, Hugh Munro's a good man."
00:35:36.969,00:35:42.641,"I won't deny it, but this is what becomes of a man who breaks his oath to king and country."
00:35:47.020,00:35:48.563,"He's right, Jamie."
00:35:48.605,00:35:53.902,"You have to meet him, I understand that, but I say we all go with you with our swords in our hands."
00:35:53.944,00:35:55.403,"Otherwise, you don't go at all."
00:35:56.488,00:35:58.156,-Aye.
00:36:21.262,00:36:23.849,getting on my horse.
00:36:23.890,00:36:28.394,"I don't remember riding away, or even how long we rode."
00:36:28.436,00:36:35.401,"All I can recall of that pivotal moment in my life was that I was angry, and I didn't know why."
00:36:43.827,00:36:45.120,You'll have to stay here with Willie.
00:36:46.163,00:36:47.622,What?
00:36:47.664,00:36:49.624,Dougal was right.
00:36:49.666,00:36:51.918,"Now, this man Horrocks may be setting a trap."
00:36:52.836,00:36:55.005,I won't risk you again.
00:36:55.047,00:36:57.007,You'll be safer here with Willie to look out for ye.
00:36:59.258,00:37:01.219,You can take Willie with you.
00:37:01.260,00:37:03.429,I can look after myself.
00:37:07.517,00:37:09.268,You needn't prove it again.
00:37:13.565,00:37:17.235,"If there are redcoats about, they'll likely come from the south."
00:37:17.276,00:37:18.820,-I'll keep an eye out.
00:37:20.238,00:37:21.614,You stay here.
00:37:21.656,00:37:22.991,"I'll be back, I promise."
00:37:23.033,00:37:24.868,You shouldn't make promises you can't keep.
00:37:24.910,00:37:26.411,"This one I will keep, Claire."
00:37:27.620,00:37:29.206,"Now, you promise me you'll stay put."
00:37:31.249,00:37:32.542,"Promise me, Claire."
00:37:32.584,00:37:33.919,Swear you'll be here when I get back.
00:37:35.754,00:37:37.547,"Fine, I promise."
00:37:37.589,00:37:38.715,Good.
00:37:42.301,00:37:44.637,the reason for my bitterness became clear to me.
00:37:46.723,00:37:50.351,I wasn't angry at Jamie or the redcoat deserters.
00:37:51.519,00:38:02.614,"I was angry at myself for forgetting about my plan to make my way back to the stones at Craigh na Dun, my plan to return to my own time, to my husband, Frank."
00:38:02.655,00:38:11.831,"US Army headquarters in Berlin announced the death of General George S Patton Jr, earlier today from injuries he sustained in a car accident 12 days ago."
00:38:11.873,00:38:16.294,"Patton's Cadillac model 75 staff car, transporting the general..."
00:38:18.296,00:38:23.969,As well as private first class Horace L Woodring collided with a truck just outside of Spain.
00:38:29.307,00:38:37.607,"A controversial figure, general Patton's career spanned both the First and Second World Wars, most recently as commander of the us. Third army..."
00:39:12.184,00:39:14.352,Mistress?
00:39:16.688,00:39:17.689,Mistress!
00:39:18.940,00:39:20.108,What?
00:39:20.150,00:39:23.111,"If you need me, I'll just be taking care of some personal business."
00:39:24.321,00:39:26.531,Go at least 50 yards away and downwind.
00:39:26.865,00:39:27.907,Aye.
00:39:52.015,00:40:03.526,"to avoid thinking about the incident in the meadow, but my mind kept returning to it, again, and again, picking at a festering sore best left untouched."
00:40:18.583,00:40:21.253,"And suddenly, there it was..."
00:40:22.795,00:40:24.214,Craigh na Dun.
00:40:27.259,00:40:32.597,"My mind had been so clouded and confused, I didn't recognize the road when we rode in."
00:40:33.932,00:40:35.934,There was no mistaking it.
00:40:37.102,00:40:42.065,I was back to the place where it had all begun.
00:40:43.400,00:40:47.445,So much had happened.
00:40:47.486,00:40:53.326,"Last I was here, I was Claire Randall, then Claire Beauchamp, then Claire Fraser."
00:40:54.619,00:40:57.789,"The question was, who did I want to be?"
00:42:59.618,00:43:00.828,Claire.
00:43:04.332,00:43:05.542,Claire.
00:43:11.756,00:43:13.091,Claire!
00:43:17.095,00:43:19.680,"Where are you, Claire?"
00:43:21.724,00:43:22.767,Frank!
00:43:25.103,00:43:26.271,Claire!
00:43:26.771,00:43:30.149,"Frank, wait for me."
00:43:58.136,00:43:59.137,No!
00:44:00.472,00:44:01.639,Frank!
00:44:05.143,00:44:06.311,Frank!
00:44:11.608,00:44:12.817,Claire.
00:45:00.823,00:45:05.911,"we were going without having to ask, Fort William."
00:45:15.338,00:45:18.508,He would have no advance notice of my capture.
00:45:18.550,00:45:21.969,No time to plan his interrogation.
00:45:22.011,00:45:27.141,"I, on the other hand, had the entire jolting journey in the back of the wagon to think."
00:45:27.183,00:45:29.352,It was my one advantage.
00:45:29.394,00:45:31.312,I prayed it would be enough.
00:45:32.605,00:45:36.025,and congratulations on your recent marriage.
00:45:37.943,00:45:42.323,Though I don't particularly care whether you consider yourself an Englishwoman or a Scot...
00:45:44.659,00:45:47.036,"And apparently, neither do you."
00:45:47.078,00:45:49.581,You still wear your old wedding ring?
00:45:53.042,00:45:55.169,Sentimental attachment.
00:45:55.211,00:45:58.047,I doubt you have a sentimental bone in your body.
00:46:02.301,00:46:11.644,"But the more interesting question is why would Dougal MacKenzie consider you of such value, that he would rather adopt you as one of his own than allow me to question you?"
00:46:13.104,00:46:16.399,I am sure I have no idea what you're talking about.
00:46:16.857,00:46:18.025,Really?
00:46:20.236,00:46:21.487,The King.
00:46:22.530,00:46:23.864,The King.
00:46:28.286,00:46:30.996,I'm glad to hear that you still consider him your sovereign.
00:46:31.038,00:46:33.416,We MacKenzies are all loyal subjects.
00:46:35.293,00:46:38.254,That is the single most amusing thing I've heard all week.
00:46:39.880,00:46:44.260,So I take it you haven't been amusing yourself by flogging some innocent prisoners then?
00:46:44.302,00:46:45.844,Amusing myself?
00:46:47.138,00:46:48.431,What an odd thing to say.
00:47:23.174,00:47:28.513,"Madam, you need to understand your position."
00:47:28.554,00:47:40.232,"In this hour, our third encounter, I fully intend by any means necessary to discover both your true nature and the secrets that you hold."
00:47:45.196,00:47:47.657,Perhaps you should ask the Duke of Sandringham.
00:47:52.537,00:47:56.248,"Oh, dear me, I do hope that won't stain."
00:48:04.590,00:48:11.347,"gambit to be sure, but his reaction told me that Frank and the Reverend were right in their speculation."
00:48:11.389,00:48:19.230,"your ancestor had a patron, a prominent and powerful man who could protect him from the censure of his superiors."
00:48:19.271,00:48:24.736,"Possibly, but it would have to have been someone very high up in the hierarchy of the day to exert that kind of influence."
00:48:25.611,00:48:26.863,The Duke of Sandringham?
00:48:27.988,00:48:31.033,The Duke of Sandringham?
00:48:31.075,00:48:41.794,"was able to commit his various crimes in the Highlands because he was being protected by a powerful man, and the cost of such protection was always silence and fidelity."
00:48:44.797,00:48:45.922,What do you know of the Duke?
00:48:48.426,00:48:52.346,"Really, captain, must you be so obtuse?"
00:49:09.363,00:49:11.574,Because he tells you all his secrets?
00:49:13.492,00:49:17.413,You must be a very special officer indeed.
00:49:20.541,00:49:23.294,I will simply send a message to Sandringham asking him.
00:49:27.465,00:49:28.800,Excellent idea.
00:49:30.301,00:49:38.517,"I'm sure he'll be most pleased at your skill and acumen at uncovering my identity, or..."
00:49:38.559,00:49:43.773,Perhaps your disruption of the Duke's carefully laid plans will not be rewarded.
00:49:43.815,00:49:57.035,"Perhaps he will be displeased, and take measures to terminate your special relationship, withdraw the protection to which you've become accustomed, and thus leave you at the mercy of your superior officers and local authorities."
00:49:59.996,00:50:12.008,"No, the wisest course of action would be to allow me to continue my mission and give the Duke no indication of how close you came to disrupting his efforts on behalf of the king."
00:50:26.357,00:50:28.526,"You mean, of course, his, uh, his wife's efforts."
00:50:30.987,00:50:32.112,His wife?
00:50:32.154,00:50:34.949,The Duchess.
00:50:34.991,00:50:37.326,"-Oh, I've never had the pleasure."
00:50:37.368,00:50:40.872,An agent of the Duke is an agent of the Duchess.
00:50:41.956,00:50:44.166,"Well, we have been in communication."
00:50:44.208,00:50:46.460,Communication by letter?
00:50:46.502,00:50:48.838,"-By messenger, yes."
00:50:48.880,00:50:51.047,"-That's who we're talking about, isn't it?"
00:50:52.257,00:50:53.384,"That is, uh..."
00:50:55.135,00:50:57.429,That is who we're talking about.
00:50:58.305,00:51:00.098,"But, of course, um..."
00:51:02.267,00:51:04.562,The Duke has never been married.
00:51:18.367,00:51:19.911,"-I'm sorry, madam."
00:51:29.921,00:51:33.549,What kind of gentleman keeps a rope at his desk?
00:51:33.591,00:51:35.968,"A prepared one, madam."
00:51:36.010,00:51:37.093,"You can go, Hawkins."
00:51:39.555,00:51:46.020,"And corporal, don't come back, no matter what you hear."
00:51:46.062,00:51:48.064,-Go.
00:52:03.704,00:52:06.457,"Help, somebody!"
00:52:08.626,00:52:09.835,Help me!
00:52:15.967,00:52:17.133,Now...
00:52:21.597,00:52:25.601,"I think we should begin with your name, hmm?"
00:52:27.227,00:52:28.604,Your real name.
00:52:28.646,00:52:29.855,Then...
00:52:32.566,00:52:34.944,You can tell me everything that you know about...
00:52:37.237,00:52:38.990,Dougal MacKenzie...
00:52:41.033,00:52:42.576,His brother Colum...
00:52:44.829,00:52:46.204,"The, uh..."
00:52:47.372,00:52:49.041,The Jacobite rebellion...
00:52:52.336,00:52:57.675,"And finally, the Duke of Sandringham."
00:53:00.511,00:53:02.513,You are going to regret this.
00:53:04.682,00:53:05.850,I doubt it.
00:53:26.328,00:53:27.788,What have we here?
00:53:29.040,00:53:30.374,"My, my."
00:53:31.333,00:53:33.044,The lady has claws.
00:53:33.711,00:53:34.795,Are they sharp?
00:53:39.884,00:53:41.593,"Hmm, are they?"
00:53:47.349,00:53:50.352,I'll thank ye to take your hands off my wife.
00:53:52.396,00:53:53.605,Good God.
00:00:01.209,00:00:02.252,CLAIRE: Previously...
00:00:07.257,00:00:11.887,Have you seen any of your Scottish companions raise funds for the rebellion?
00:00:11.929,00:00:13.472,Let's get on with it.
00:00:11.929,00:00:16.558,RANDALL: Why would Dougal MacKenzie rather adopt you as one of his own than allow me to question you?
00:00:16.600,00:00:21.229,I was wondering if you had a potion that might open a lad's heart to a lassie.
00:00:25.567,00:00:27.027,What's his name?
00:00:27.402,00:00:29.029,Horrocks.
00:00:29.070,00:00:31.239,There's a chance to get the price lifted from my head.
00:00:31.281,00:00:33.408,A Redcoat deserter.
00:00:31.281,00:00:35.828,"Claims he was there, saw who actually killed the Sergeant."
00:00:35.870,00:00:42.125,"CLAIRE: I knew where we were going without having to ask, the province of a man I unfortunately knew all too well."
00:00:42.167,00:00:44.712,I'll thank ye to take your hands off my wife.
00:00:52.219,00:00:54.847,"JAMIE: Strange, the things you remember."
00:00:55.723,00:01:03.271,"The people, the places, the moments in time burned into your heart forever, while others fade in the mist."
00:01:07.818,00:01:10.821,I've always known I've lived a life different from other men.
00:01:12.155,00:01:14.950,"And when I was a lad, I saw no path before me."
00:01:14.992,00:01:16.827,I simply took a step and then another.
00:01:16.869,00:01:21.081,"Ever forward, ever onward, rushing toward someplace, I knew not where."
00:01:23.751,00:01:35.345,"And one day, I turned around and looked back and saw that each step I'd taken was a choice to go left, to go right, to go forward or even not go at all."
00:01:35.387,00:01:40.350,"Every day, every man has a choice between right and wrong."
00:01:40.392,00:01:42.561,Between love and hate.
00:01:42.603,00:01:46.023,Sometimes between life and death.
00:01:46.065,00:01:49.484,And the sum of those choices becomes your life.
00:01:53.113,00:01:58.077,The day I realized that is the day I became a man.
00:02:00.621,00:02:01.580,"DOUGAL: Where's your mind, lad?"
00:02:02.790,00:02:04.124,Horrocks is waiting.
00:02:15.970,00:02:17.178,Give him the gold.
00:02:18.597,00:02:20.015,I trust his word.
00:02:20.057,00:02:22.101,"The British Army trusted him, too."
00:02:26.730,00:02:30.609,Perhaps today's not such a good day for business after all.
00:02:30.651,00:02:35.405,"Whether you deserted is no concern of ours, Mr. Horrocks."
00:02:35.447,00:02:37.157,We commend ye for it.
00:02:37.825,00:02:44.039,"I've come a long way, at considerable danger to myself, eluding Redcoat patrols..."
00:02:56.760,00:03:03.017,The man who shot the Sergeant was Captain Jonathan Randall himself.
00:03:03.058,00:03:07.855,"Ye expect us to believe that a captain, even one as vile as Black Jack, would shoot his own man?"
00:03:08.730,00:03:10.273,You know Randall.
00:03:10.315,00:03:11.733,I suppose he can answer that.
00:03:11.775,00:03:14.528,I canna use Randall's name to clear my own.
00:03:14.569,00:03:17.072,You bargained for a name.
00:03:20.784,00:03:22.201,"Good day, lads."
00:03:25.288,00:03:26.540,Let him go.
00:03:26.581,00:03:28.083,MAN: Jamie!
00:03:36.133,00:03:37.801,"I was minding her, I swear."
00:03:37.843,00:03:39.761,I went for a piss and...
00:03:39.803,00:03:43.348,"She must've wandered off, and when I caught up, the Redcoats had her."
00:05:57.691,00:05:59.067,Where is the Englishwoman?
00:05:59.109,00:06:00.485,I don't know who you mean.
00:06:01.903,00:06:03.947,My friend here isna a bit pleased with yer answer.
00:06:03.989,00:06:05.573,"Pray, I don't know."
00:06:06.908,00:06:08.618,Pray that you do.
00:06:08.660,00:06:10.120,Or your next words'll be in a lassie's voice.
00:06:14.041,00:06:15.709,The commander's office.
00:06:15.750,00:06:17.002,In the tower.
00:06:19.671,00:06:21.380,Thank you.
00:06:37.064,00:06:39.149,"Murtagh, don't ye wait too long."
00:07:56.435,00:07:57.477,CLAIRE: Help!
00:08:15.620,00:08:18.539,I'll thank ye to take your hands off my wife.
00:08:20.208,00:08:21.584,Good God.
00:08:27.090,00:08:31.594,Dougal MacKenzie neglected to mention that you married the stripe-backed thief.
00:08:31.636,00:08:33.096,How's my handiwork looking these days?
00:08:34.181,00:08:41.521,"Very well, despite your efforts."
00:08:41.562,00:08:46.193,I don't suppose you'd show me?
00:08:46.234,00:08:47.777,Be the last thing you ever saw.
00:08:49.779,00:08:51.281,Oh.
00:08:51.323,00:08:53.658,"Only risk brings the possibility of reward, hmm?"
00:08:55.369,00:08:57.371,"Just shoot this bastard, Jamie."
00:09:00.707,00:09:02.667,Do. Shoot me.
00:09:06.963,00:09:09.674,Oh.
00:09:09.716,00:09:12.344,"It appears we're to have an audience, madam."
00:09:14.221,00:09:16.390,I think we should endeavor to enjoy ourselves.
00:09:17.224,00:09:18.558,I certainly shall.
00:09:19.976,00:09:26.733,"Now, put that pistol on the table and let us commence with the evening's entertainment."
00:09:27.859,00:09:29.027,Do it.
00:09:30.153,00:09:31.612,Slowly.
00:09:35.283,00:09:37.035,"I will slit her throat, I swear to God."
00:09:41.039,00:09:42.082,Slowly.
00:09:50.215,00:09:51.591,That wasn't too hard.
00:09:55.970,00:09:57.431,Do it!
00:10:03.270,00:10:05.355,Just go. Go!
00:10:05.397,00:10:06.606,"Everyone, keep calm."
00:10:11.236,00:10:12.612,Easy does it.
00:10:18.952,00:10:22.080,"Oh, first she orders you to fire, now she orders you to flee."
00:10:22.122,00:10:23.957,"Who is the man in this marriage, Fraser?"
00:10:23.998,00:10:26.626,"I will cut off your balls, I swear."
00:10:26.667,00:10:29.504,You are a foul-mouthed scold.
00:10:29.546,00:10:40.348,"For the life of me, I cannot understand why any man would pledge himself to a woman."
00:10:40.390,00:10:43.643,Especially such a mendacious slut as this one.
00:10:48.482,00:10:51.692,Would you like your husband to join us maybe?
00:10:54.112,00:10:55.655,"What do you say, Fraser, hmm?"
00:10:56.072,00:10:57.449,Huh?
00:11:18.303,00:11:20.597,You bluffed your way in here with an empty pistol.
00:11:21.848,00:11:24.767,"Ned said not to kill anyone, so I had all the weapons unloaded."
00:11:24.809,00:11:25.684,This way.
00:11:28.522,00:11:29.564,Wait.
00:11:32.859,00:11:35.820,JAMIE: Sometimes I wonder why I chose not to take his life.
00:11:35.862,00:11:40.158,"But at that moment, I only thought to make certain he wasn't about to raise the alarm."
00:11:40.200,00:11:43.995,"It never occurred to me to kill a helpless man, even one such as Randall."
00:11:56.299,00:11:57.967,Alert!
00:12:14.733,00:12:15.985,Get ready!
00:12:16.027,00:12:17.153,Forward!
00:12:42.721,00:12:43.762,Up.
00:12:46.140,00:12:47.392,Up here.
00:12:50.144,00:12:52.355,"You are sure there's water down there, aren't you?"
00:12:53.898,00:12:55.358,I think so.
00:13:39.026,00:13:41.154,Still a couple hours' ride from the drover.
00:13:42.363,00:13:43.948,We should water the horses.
00:13:49.828,00:13:50.829,Aye.
00:13:57.337,00:13:59.005,"Give him a drink of water, will ye?"
00:14:00.839,00:14:01.840,Aye.
00:14:17.691,00:14:18.857,Are you all right?
00:14:20.276,00:14:22.654,"Randall, he didn't hurt you?"
00:14:24.905,00:14:26.866,"He didn't have time, thanks to you."
00:14:33.707,00:14:35.834,I'm waiting for you to say something.
00:14:35.875,00:14:38.336,Anything that approaches an apology.
00:14:40.046,00:14:41.339,An apology?
00:14:44.384,00:14:48.137,I was taken hostage by Jack Randall.
00:14:48.179,00:14:50.515,Are you trying to say that's somehow my fault?
00:14:50.557,00:14:52.600,"Well, it is your fault."
00:14:52.642,00:14:56.563,"Had you stayed put where I ordered you to stay, none of this would have happened."
00:14:56.604,00:14:58.314,"Yeah, but no."
00:14:56.604,00:15:00.525,"Ye won't listen to me, why mind me, I am not but yer husband."
00:15:00.567,00:15:08.783,"Ye take it into yer mind to do as ye damn please and next I ken, I find ye flat on yer back with yer skirts up, and the worst scum of the land between your legs, about to take you before my very eyes."
00:15:08.825,00:15:10.744,I begged you to take me with you.
00:15:10.785,00:15:13.329,And I told you there was no danger in me going along.
00:15:13.371,00:15:15.498,Would you listen to me? No.
00:15:15.540,00:15:17.124,"No, I'm only a woman."
00:15:17.166,00:15:19.794,"No, why should you pay any attention to what I have to say?"
00:15:23.256,00:15:26.050,"If ye'd done that, we wouldn't be on the run now with a hundred Redcoats on our tail."
00:15:27.761,00:15:30.513,Try that again and I'll slap you until yer ears ring.
00:15:30.555,00:15:32.640,You're a brute and a fool!
00:15:32.682,00:15:35.643,Do you think I went and got captured by the English on purpose?
00:15:35.685,00:15:40.607,Aye! I do think ye did it on purpose to get back at me for what happened at the glade.
00:15:41.357,00:15:42.483,At the glade?
00:15:43.735,00:15:45.695,With the British deserters?
00:15:45.737,00:15:52.660,"You think, to punish you, I went for a walk in the woods on the chance that some British soldiers would be going by?"
00:15:53.703,00:15:55.455,"Christ, Jamie, I went for a walk!"
00:15:55.496,00:15:58.040,I ordered you to stay put!
00:15:58.082,00:16:00.710,I don't have to do what you tell me to.
00:16:00.752,00:16:02.128,"Aye, you do."
00:16:02.169,00:16:03.838,You are my wife.
00:16:05.799,00:16:08.008,Your wife.
00:16:08.050,00:16:10.344,"You think I'm your property, don't you?"
00:16:10.386,00:16:15.308,You think I belong to you and you can't stand for someone to have something else that belongs to you.
00:16:15.349,00:16:18.561,"You do belong to me and you are my wife, whether you like it or not."
00:16:18.603,00:16:20.062,"Well, I don't like it!"
00:16:20.855,00:16:23.441,I don't like it one bit!
00:16:23.483,00:16:25.610,"That doesn't matter to you either, does it?"
00:16:25.652,00:16:30.615,"And as long as I'm there to warm your bed, you don't care what I think or how I feel!"
00:16:30.657,00:16:32.951,That's all a wife is to you.
00:16:32.992,00:16:35.662,Something to stick your cock into whenever you feel the urge.
00:16:36.955,00:16:40.291,"Let go of me, you fucking bastard!"
00:16:40.333,00:16:41.960,You foul-mouthed bitch!
00:16:42.001,00:16:43.461,You'll not speak to me that way!
00:17:16.911,00:17:25.127,I went to you at Fort William armed with an empty pistol and my bare hands.
00:17:32.677,00:17:34.387,When you screamed...
00:17:42.896,00:17:45.398,"You're tearing my guts out, Claire."
00:17:58.202,00:17:59.370,I'm sorry.
00:18:01.497,00:18:07.086,"Jamie, forgive me."
00:18:23.770,00:18:25.021,Forgiven.
00:18:29.776,00:18:31.110,"I'm sorry, too."
00:18:36.407,00:18:38.034,I'll ask your pardon for what I said.
00:18:38.076,00:18:40.995,I was sore and I said more than I meant.
00:18:44.832,00:18:46.417,"Will ye forgive me, too?"
00:18:48.669,00:18:50.129,Forgiven.
00:18:58.429,00:19:01.474,JAMIE: She asked forgiveness and I gave it.
00:19:01.515,00:19:08.064,"But the truth is, I'd forgiven everything she'd done and everything she could do, long before that day."
00:19:08.106,00:19:11.067,"For me, that was no choice."
00:19:11.109,00:19:13.193,That was falling in love.
00:19:43.724,00:19:45.852,"Looks like we'll be needing a few more plates, then."
00:20:02.702,00:20:09.917,"So, while Murtagh setting the fuses on the gunpowder, I sent three of the bloody jessies to meet the Almighty."
00:20:11.335,00:20:13.129,I am not hearing this.
00:20:14.088,00:20:17.466,"When I heard the explosion, I thought the walls of the fort would come down."
00:20:17.508,00:20:20.427,Did ye use yer breath or yer farts to subdue them?
00:20:22.972,00:20:24.348,Are you calling me a liar?
00:20:24.390,00:20:26.726,"Aye, because ye are lying."
00:20:26.767,00:20:27.643,Ye killed nobody.
00:20:29.562,00:20:30.813,"Oh, oh."
00:20:30.855,00:20:32.314,"For God's sake, Angus!"
00:20:32.356,00:20:37.361,"Sit down and stop flapping yer gums, use it for something useful for a change."
00:20:37.403,00:20:40.447,MAN: I'm not gonna tell anything if you're taking that tone.
00:20:40.489,00:20:43.034,I don't believe I've properly thanked all of you.
00:20:43.076,00:20:44.160,For what you did last night.
00:20:44.202,00:20:46.579,"Ned, have ye got any wine down there?"
00:20:46.620,00:20:49.289,"NED: Yeah, well, they do actually have some rhenish."
00:20:49.331,00:20:50.750,"Quite nice, if I may say."
00:20:55.504,00:20:56.964,It's been a long day.
00:20:57.006,00:20:58.132,I'll go upstairs.
00:21:07.183,00:21:09.852,She doesna understand what she nearly cost us.
00:21:26.702,00:21:28.287,Think they'll ever speak to me again?
00:21:30.081,00:21:31.082,Aye.
00:21:33.333,00:21:34.501,They will.
00:21:42.384,00:21:43.636,"Come to bed, Jamie."
00:21:45.846,00:21:51.351,I'm afraid we've a matter still to settle between us before we sleep tonight.
00:21:53.520,00:21:54.396,What is it?
00:21:58.400,00:22:09.453,"If a man among us had put the rest in danger, as you did, he would have likely had his ears cropped, or been flogged, if not killed outright."
00:22:11.122,00:22:12.331,I didn't know.
00:22:18.254,00:22:22.591,"Well, I ken you're not yet familiar with our ways, and that's some excuse."
00:22:24.510,00:22:27.305,"Still, I did tell ye to stay hid."
00:22:29.682,00:22:31.892,"And if ye'd done so, none of this would have happened."
00:22:31.934,00:22:35.104,"Now, the British will be looking high and low for us."
00:22:35.146,00:22:36.939,As for Captain Randall...
00:22:38.691,00:22:42.028,"Well, that's something else again."
00:22:42.069,00:22:45.614,"He'll be looking for you, especially now that he knows you're here."
00:22:45.656,00:22:46.448,Aye.
00:22:47.658,00:22:48.492,He...
00:22:51.037,00:22:53.664,It's personal for him.
00:22:53.706,00:22:55.373,"I am so sorry, Jamie."
00:22:57.626,00:23:00.504,"If it were just me ye'd hurt by it, I wouldna say more about it."
00:23:04.925,00:23:08.762,But your actions put all the men in jeopardy.
00:23:13.309,00:23:16.729,"Right, best get on with it."
00:23:20.607,00:23:29.449,"Ye've done considerable damage disobeying my orders, and I'm gonna punish ye for it."
00:23:31.660,00:23:32.828,What do you mean?
00:23:33.954,00:23:36.374,"Oh, you know fine well what I mean."
00:23:36.414,00:23:39.585,"Now, get down by the bed and lift yer shift, lass."
00:23:39.626,00:23:41.087,I'll do no such thing.
00:23:41.128,00:23:42.462,"Now, Claire..."
00:23:42.504,00:23:45.925,I have said I'm sorry.
00:23:45.966,00:23:48.052,And I will never do such a thing again.
00:23:48.094,00:23:51.138,That's just the point.
00:23:51.180,00:23:54.767,"Ye come from a place where things are easier, I think."
00:23:56.685,00:24:03.692,Where it's not a matter of life and death if you disobey orders or take matters into your own hands.
00:24:03.734,00:24:11.951,But it's the hard truth in places and times like these that a light action can have very serious consequences.
00:24:13.160,00:24:14.870,All right.
00:24:14.912,00:24:16.956,"You're right, of course."
00:24:20.376,00:24:21.419,Good.
00:24:27.633,00:24:28.759,What?
00:24:28.801,00:24:31.637,I said I would follow your orders.
00:24:31.678,00:24:36.474,"There's a difference between understanding something in yer mind and really knowing it, deep down."
00:24:36.516,00:24:44.024,I can tell ye from my own experience that a good hiding makes ye understand things in a more serious light.
00:24:48.028,00:24:49.029,But it wasn't.
00:24:52.199,00:24:54.452,"There's such a thing as justice, Claire."
00:24:54.492,00:24:58.580,"You've done wrong to all the men, and you must suffer for it."
00:24:58.622,00:25:00.207,I'm yer husband.
00:25:00.249,00:25:02.251,It's my duty to attend to it.
00:25:02.293,00:25:04.586,I will not let you beat me.
00:25:04.628,00:25:06.088,I doubt you'll have much to say about it.
00:25:09.425,00:25:11.093,CLAIRE: Ow.
00:25:11.135,00:25:12.678,The lad's getting on with it.
00:25:12.719,00:25:13.929,Seems so.
00:25:13.971,00:25:15.348,That is his duty.
00:25:16.849,00:25:18.851,"You're my wife, like it or not."
00:25:18.892,00:25:20.853,I'll scream!
00:25:20.894,00:25:21.895,"Well, likely, if not before, certainly during!"
00:25:23.147,00:25:24.564,No!
00:25:24.606,00:25:26.524,I expect they'll hear ye in the next village.
00:25:27.776,00:25:28.610,Ye've got good lungs.
00:25:32.739,00:25:35.368,"This'll go faster if ye just yield, woman."
00:25:35.409,00:25:36.910,I'm gonna make you suffer!
00:25:38.120,00:25:40.789,"Well, ye already are."
00:25:40.831,00:25:42.666,"You're taking pleasure in this, you barbarian!"
00:25:44.001,00:25:45.919,Sounds like holy hell up there.
00:25:45.961,00:25:48.005,I'm not sure who's punishing who.
00:25:50.090,00:25:51.633,I'll never forgive you!
00:25:51.675,00:25:56.514,"If I can forgive ye for what you did, you can forgive me, too, as soon as ye can sit down again."
00:25:58.432,00:25:59.599,You sadist!
00:25:59.641,00:26:01.435,"I dinna ken, what's a sadist?"
00:26:04.646,00:26:06.440,No!
00:26:06.482,00:26:08.484,I didna say I wasna gonna enjoy it.
00:26:20.120,00:26:23.082,I hope that Jamie wasn't too harsh on ye last night?
00:26:23.123,00:26:25.834,A skelped arse never did anyone permanent damage.
00:26:25.876,00:26:27.627,Looks like she gave as good as she got.
00:26:27.669,00:26:30.797,"Ah, well, it might not be permanent, but it hurts like hell."
00:26:30.839,00:26:33.467,She'll not make that mistake again.
00:26:33.509,00:26:35.553,"Come and have a seat here next to me, lassie."
00:26:35.593,00:26:37.721,"No, thank you, I'll stand."
00:26:43.185,00:26:44.353,Over there.
00:26:44.811,00:26:46.021,Ooh!
00:26:56.823,00:26:58.784,"JAMIE: Justice done, problem solved."
00:27:01.245,00:27:04.957,And I thought the page had turned on an unpleasant chapter.
00:27:04.998,00:27:10.628,"But I had precious little experience as a husband, or I would never have had such naive expectations."
00:27:12.756,00:27:23.100,"If anything, returning to Castle Leoch only heightened the tensions and strains on my newfound marriage and presented me with more choices that would affect our lives for years still to come."
00:27:27.980,00:27:29.064,Hooray!
00:27:38.198,00:27:41.243,"Welcome home, my dears."
00:27:43.412,00:27:44.580,Well done.
00:27:56.425,00:27:59.052,Congratulations to you both.
00:27:59.094,00:28:01.639,I look forward to hearing all about yer nuptials.
00:28:04.391,00:28:07.144,It's been some time since we've had a wedding here.
00:28:18.071,00:28:29.416,"My profound good wishes for a long and happy marriage, Lady Broch Tuarach."
00:29:17.756,00:29:18.757,Why?
00:29:22.344,00:29:23.762,Why did you do it?
00:29:24.638,00:29:26.056,"I waited for you, Jamie."
00:29:28.767,00:29:31.729,I was counting the days till you'd return.
00:29:31.770,00:29:33.397,I had no notion about yerself and...
00:29:34.607,00:29:36.024,It wasna something I planned.
00:29:37.109,00:29:38.569,Then why?
00:29:38.611,00:29:39.778,Why did ye do it?
00:29:41.821,00:29:45.325,"'Twas Dougal's arrangement, ye see."
00:29:45.367,00:29:48.746,"It's no simple story, I can tell ye that much."
00:29:48.787,00:29:52.040,But an explanation will have to wait.
00:29:52.082,00:29:53.917,Colum summons me.
00:29:54.876,00:29:56.629,Aye.
00:29:56.670,00:29:58.130,Ye canna keep a MacKenzie waiting.
00:30:01.467,00:30:03.385,But we'll speak again.
00:30:03.427,00:30:06.888,"Aye, you have my word."
00:30:14.605,00:30:15.814,Ah.
00:30:15.855,00:30:17.524,'Tis the bridegroom.
00:30:18.651,00:30:19.818,Aye.
00:30:24.448,00:30:32.539,"Now that I have all three of you weasels gathered together, who would like to explain Fort William?"
00:30:32.581,00:30:37.043,"Is Clan MacKenzie going to have to answer for yer little raid, hmm?"
00:30:39.296,00:30:40.339,No.
00:30:41.965,00:30:45.636,Any repercussions will land solely on me.
00:30:45.678,00:30:47.763,Captain Randall will make sure of that.
00:30:49.139,00:30:50.140,Fine.
00:30:52.184,00:30:53.852,"Now, back to the rents."
00:30:56.396,00:30:59.232,"As I say, it has been a lean year for some of the tenants."
00:30:59.274,00:31:03.737,"But we have much of the stock still to sell off, which should help to tip the scales."
00:31:03.779,00:31:05.572,What about the other money you collected?
00:31:07.157,00:31:11.370,"The money for the Bonnie Stuart Prince across the water, hmm?"
00:31:30.889,00:31:34.852,"'Tis for the Jacobites, is it not?"
00:31:48.407,00:31:53.453,Did ye not think that one among the rent party would remain loyal to his laird?
00:31:54.788,00:32:00.919,"Or at least, young Jamie, here, he does me the honor of looking fittingly guilty."
00:32:03.714,00:32:06.132,You mistake concern for guilt.
00:32:07.133,00:32:08.968,My conscience is clear.
00:32:09.010,00:32:12.389,I owe no loyalty to Charlie or James.
00:32:13.599,00:32:15.475,"He speaks truth, brother."
00:32:17.936,00:32:22.816,We merely used the welts on his back to illustrate British justice.
00:32:25.485,00:32:27.279,We raised that gold honorably.
00:32:28.572,00:32:37.205,We never concealed the fact from anybody that we were raising money to restore the rightful king to his throne.
00:32:37.247,00:32:43.378,"That, I might remind ye, is a cause more important than any clan or man."
00:32:51.219,00:32:52.429,Is that so?
00:32:54.890,00:32:58.101,"Well, this clan remains under the charge of this man."
00:32:59.352,00:33:03.148,It is still my pleasure to choose what causes are supported.
00:33:04.691,00:33:09.195,And the Clan MacKenzie's welfare comes before any king or country.
00:33:09.237,00:33:12.031,I've proved my loyalty to you time and again.
00:33:13.241,00:33:20.081,"I've collected your rents, I've fought your battles, I've protected yer person, for the love of Christ, I've even assured your bloodline!"
00:33:25.253,00:33:34.012,"Now, I think that such fealty is worth a mere bag of gold, don't you?"
00:33:39.518,00:33:40.769,Leave my sight.
00:33:56.117,00:33:58.620,I shall try to calm his distemper.
00:34:00.079,00:34:02.916,Either that or I will calm it for him.
00:34:06.837,00:34:09.923,Perhaps you'd rather chastise me at a later time?
00:34:09.965,00:34:11.216,Stay.
00:34:22.936,00:34:26.189,I opened my home to you as sanctuary from the British.
00:34:28.650,00:34:33.238,"I gave my food, I gave my hospitality."
00:34:33.279,00:34:39.745,"Even when you refused to pledge fealty to me, I continued to grant ye quarter and protection."
00:34:40.746,00:34:43.122,And how am I recompensed?
00:34:44.583,00:34:52.007,"You marry a Sassenach, knowing well enough that none in the clan will support ye now as my successor."
00:34:52.049,00:34:55.093,"I meant no such betrayal, uncle."
00:35:06.563,00:35:08.106,Get out.
00:35:10.442,00:35:11.693,CLAIRE: I knew it.
00:35:11.735,00:35:15.405,That first time I saw Dougal and Hamish playing together in the courtyard.
00:35:15.447,00:35:16.489,Aye.
00:35:17.783,00:35:22.245,"Many have gossiped about it in whispers, and every one of us in the room already kent it well."
00:35:22.287,00:35:26.332,But that's the first time I've ever heard Dougal proclaim he's Hamish's father.
00:35:29.168,00:35:32.923,Thought Colum was going to run him through right there.
00:35:35.258,00:35:41.139,"Aye, if the storm canna be calmed between the brothers, I'll be the one to pay the price."
00:35:41.180,00:35:44.768,"It's hardly the first time he and Dougal have been at odds, God knows."
00:35:44.810,00:35:46.728,I'm sure it'll be fine in the morning.
00:35:58.740,00:36:00.533,What are you doing?
00:36:00.575,00:36:01.576,I thought...
00:36:01.618,00:36:03.036,Think again.
00:36:22.555,00:36:25.183,"Dougal tells ye something, it's as if it's law."
00:36:26.726,00:36:28.186,"Devil, man."
00:36:29.646,00:36:33.692,His mouth has been in Colum's ear and his lips half up his arse!
00:36:33.733,00:36:36.862,He gave Colum the moneys collected for the Jacobites.
00:36:36.903,00:36:38.446,And it wasna his to give.
00:36:38.488,00:36:39.322,It wasna Colum's to take.
00:36:41.033,00:36:43.118,The MacKenzie ordered me to do it!
00:36:43.160,00:36:45.411,I was just serving my oath to himself as given!
00:36:45.453,00:36:47.039,Or would you have me lie to the laird?
00:36:47.080,00:36:49.875,"If the MacKenzie asked you the same, you'd do it, would you not?"
00:36:53.503,00:36:55.922,"And what about you, Jamie?"
00:36:56.923,00:37:00.552,Where does your loyalty lie between the Chief and the War Chief?
00:37:03.722,00:37:06.099,"Now, there is but one laird of the clan, is there not?"
00:37:07.517,00:37:09.602,Enough of this blather.
00:37:09.644,00:37:10.979,The issue needs no debate.
00:37:11.021,00:37:13.815,The lad shoulda come to us for counsel afore taking action.
00:37:13.857,00:37:17.777,"For his disobedience, he's getting the due course of punishment."
00:37:17.819,00:37:21.698,"Besides, this is MacKenzie business."
00:37:21.740,00:37:23.783,You Frasers should mind to yer own.
00:37:25.202,00:37:27.328,"Now, stand aside and let us get back to ours."
00:37:27.370,00:37:28.246,Hey.
00:37:31.666,00:37:32.417,"What's all this, then?"
00:37:36.004,00:37:37.881,I thought we were hunting stag?
00:37:39.925,00:37:40.967,Aye.
00:37:45.722,00:37:47.348,Who's with me?
00:38:26.721,00:38:30.308,It's getting a wee bit uncomfortable around here for my taste.
00:38:32.936,00:38:34.312,Rupert's right.
00:38:35.021,00:38:36.314,This is not our fight.
00:38:38.942,00:38:41.987,Ye take hold of Claire and we'll be away from here this very night.
00:38:42.028,00:38:43.404,And how would we live?
00:38:44.697,00:38:47.993,"Horrocks was my best chance, and now, I may be even an outlaw for good."
00:38:48.034,00:38:50.120,We'll live off the land.
00:38:50.162,00:38:52.330,Or has castle life made ye soft?
00:38:53.581,00:38:56.126,Would ye have me sleeping under a tree come winter with my wife?
00:38:57.418,00:38:59.212,"Leave her, then."
00:38:59.254,00:39:01.589,We can send for the lass when we find safe beds.
00:39:01.631,00:39:04.550,"Aye, spoken like the unwed man ye are."
00:39:04.592,00:39:09.764,"For pity's sake, Jamie, it's either up tail and away, or we stay and pick a side."
00:39:09.806,00:39:12.350,It's not like Colum's gonna give Dougal back the gold.
00:39:15.228,00:39:18.106,Not that I see that it matters much either way.
00:39:18.148,00:39:20.733,The Bonnie Prince isna sailing from Italy anytime soon.
00:39:21.818,00:39:26.364,"No, he isna, is he?"
00:39:30.994,00:39:33.454,"Peace, you say? Peace?"
00:39:33.496,00:39:36.916,You come here and tell me that clansman brawls with clansman!
00:39:36.958,00:39:38.960,That my own brother defies me.
00:39:42.588,00:39:46.384,"Well, chastising the guilty might sooth yer anger, but I doubt it will accomplish anything more."
00:39:46.425,00:39:51.389,"The bad blood will only fester, leading to more violence, until the clan explodes into open warfare."
00:39:53.016,00:39:54.392,What would you have me do?
00:39:57.562,00:39:59.772,Make yer brother a gift of the Jacobite gold.
00:40:01.566,00:40:04.152,You'd have me commit treason to the crown?
00:40:04.194,00:40:06.321,Sanction a Stuart restoration to the throne?
00:40:06.363,00:40:08.656,"A Stuart restoration is but an airy hope, my Laird."
00:40:08.698,00:40:11.743,There is no Jacobite army.
00:40:11.784,00:40:16.331,The Highland clans are too busy reiving each other's cattle to even consider uniting.
00:40:16.373,00:40:20.126,"While Bonnie Prince Charlie lounges idly, being pampered by the Pope."
00:40:20.168,00:40:23.880,"Aye. Aye, all that is true."
00:40:23.922,00:40:27.342,"Meanwhile, my own clan teeters on the brink of civil war."
00:40:27.384,00:40:29.594,Then remove the source of the immediate conflict.
00:40:29.635,00:40:33.431,Give Dougal back the gold and ye pacify him and his companions.
00:40:39.687,00:40:43.441,"Let yer brother play the rebel, as long as he does it quietly."
00:40:45.318,00:40:57.205,"Let him whisper of a free Scotland for now, while you bide your time and wait to see how events transpire."
00:40:57.247,00:41:01.459,"If Bonnie Prince Charlie ever returns with a call to arms, you can decide then which side to back."
00:41:03.211,00:41:07.924,"Dougal may be War Chief, but he knows only you can cry for war."
00:41:19.311,00:41:22.314,Bring my brother and Ned Gowan here.
00:41:52.385,00:41:56.181,"Are we to stand here all day, or is there a purpose to this summons?"
00:42:12.947,00:42:19.537,"One day, brother, you'll talk your head off your shoulders and right onto a pike."
00:42:29.964,00:42:33.926,"A month ago, you swore an oath to me on this dirk."
00:42:33.968,00:42:35.636,Ye recall?
00:42:36.804,00:42:38.390,Aye.
00:42:38.431,00:42:41.851,"So tell me, brother, what's a man's word worth these days?"
00:42:45.522,00:42:47.315,"A bag of gold, perhaps?"
00:42:49.734,00:42:52.987,My oath to you is an oath to Scotland.
00:42:53.029,00:42:56.408,"I've not broken it, nor will I ever."
00:42:59.994,00:43:01.454,We'll see.
00:43:34.237,00:43:36.072,"Go on, then."
00:43:36.114,00:43:37.490,Play the rebel.
00:43:37.532,00:43:38.699,See where it leads ye.
00:43:43.121,00:43:50.253,"Ned, send a missive to the Duke of Sandringham, inviting him to a banquet in his honor."
00:43:50.295,00:43:53.131,Best warn the men of the household to keep their arses out of his reach.
00:43:57.594,00:44:04.559,"Very wise, Laird, to get the measure of the Jacobite cause from an Englishman's perspective."
00:44:04.601,00:44:08.729,"It will take more than yer approval to get back in my good graces, Ned Gowan."
00:44:08.771,00:44:12.650,"Get out of my sight, all three of you."
00:44:33.045,00:44:37.342,JAMIE: I should have been happy that the MacKenzie clan wasna about to tear itself apart.
00:44:37.383,00:44:40.470,And that I'd repaired my relationship with Colum and Dougal.
00:44:41.095,00:44:42.888,But I wasn't.
00:44:42.930,00:44:46.934,The rift with Claire was an open wound that would not heal.
00:44:46.976,00:44:50.104,"I needed to do something, make a decision."
00:44:50.146,00:44:52.231,Choose a course of action.
00:44:52.273,00:44:53.358,But what?
00:44:54.442,00:44:56.277,I kent I'd find ye here.
00:44:59.280,00:45:02.450,This has been yer secret place since ye were a lad.
00:45:03.826,00:45:06.703,Not so secret if ye found me so easily.
00:45:09.290,00:45:10.707,Ye promised we would speak.
00:45:12.168,00:45:13.419,Aye.
00:45:17.173,00:45:23.388,"I remember the first time I saw you, James Fraser, coming through the gates at Leoch."
00:45:23.429,00:45:25.722,"I was only seven years old, still a child."
00:45:27.141,00:45:31.728,You didn't notice back then how my heart leapt when you were near.
00:45:33.314,00:45:37.734,"And you went away all those years, I never forgot ye."
00:45:39.654,00:45:40.863,I'm wed now.
00:45:42.365,00:45:45.034,And 'twas a gallant thing ye did.
00:45:45.076,00:45:48.120,Marrying the Sassenach to spare her from the British.
00:45:48.162,00:45:51.332,"'Tis true the marriage was Dougal's arrangement, but..."
00:45:56.504,00:46:00.633,You dinna look very happy.
00:46:00.675,00:46:04.136,Ye look like ye're carrying the world on yer back.
00:46:09.100,00:46:10.309,Laoghaire.
00:46:10.351,00:46:16.815,"When you returned, when you took the beating for me in the great hall, I knew I wasn't wrong."
00:46:18.484,00:46:20.486,That you felt the same.
00:46:21.820,00:46:29.621,"And then, that day in the alcove, the way you kissed me."
00:46:33.708,00:46:35.792,She was married before.
00:46:42.216,00:46:51.058,I want ye to be the first and only one to have me.
00:47:01.277,00:47:03.820,I made a vow and I'll not break it.
00:47:05.906,00:47:08.159,Even for a lass as bonnie as you.
00:47:11.203,00:47:12.288,I'm sorry.
00:47:41.734,00:47:46.113,"JAMIE: For the first time since I was a lad, I felt uncertain about my next step."
00:47:47.448,00:47:51.868,"All I knew was I had to find a way forward, one step at a time."
00:47:57.416,00:47:59.876,Colum and Dougal have mended fences.
00:48:17.562,00:48:23.275,"Our lives in the Highlands are steeped in tradition, custom and ritual."
00:48:24.235,00:48:25.361,So I've seen.
00:48:25.403,00:48:32.618,"And Colum chose to risk looking weak, publicly changing his position, because peace was more important than custom."
00:48:33.828,00:48:35.663,I saw a rigid man bend.
00:48:38.374,00:48:39.916,It made me mindful.
00:48:43.128,00:48:43.920,About what?
00:48:48.593,00:48:50.094,Wives obey their husbands.
00:48:51.637,00:48:54.515,Husbands discipline them when they don't.
00:48:54.557,00:48:58.895,"Well, that's how it was with my father, and his father and on and on and on back."
00:49:01.814,00:49:05.568,"But maybe, for you and me, it has to go a different way."
00:49:19.874,00:49:28.965,"I swear on the cross of my Lord Jesus, and by the holy iron which I hold that I give you my fealty and pledge you my loyalty."
00:49:50.321,00:49:51.906,"Is it not enough, Claire?"
00:50:04.084,00:50:06.002,Do you wish to live separately?
00:50:08.422,00:50:10.006,"Well, that's what I should want..."
00:50:23.145,00:50:25.021,But I don't.
00:50:35.282,00:50:36.325,The key to Lallybroch.
00:50:38.327,00:50:39.453,What?
00:50:41.121,00:50:42.122,Yer ring.
00:50:54.802,00:50:58.054,"Why didn't you tell me that before, when you gave it to me?"
00:51:00.016,00:51:02.852,I wanted to wait until I took ye back to Lallybroch.
00:51:04.395,00:51:06.856,So ye'd know the place was as much yours as mine.
00:51:09.191,00:51:12.277,"But now, I dinna ken when, if ever, we'll get back there."
00:51:15.740,00:51:16.490,"Jamie, I..."
00:51:17.658,00:51:23.079,That thought does not pain me as much as it once might have.
00:51:28.252,00:51:31.630,You are my home now.
00:51:55.905,00:51:57.281,"I want you, Claire."
00:52:01.159,00:52:03.161,"I want ye so much, I can scarcely breathe."
00:52:05.790,00:52:08.208,Will ye have me?
00:52:10.836,00:52:14.214,"Yes. Yes, I'll have you."
00:53:06.017,00:53:07.183,Listen to me.
00:53:08.727,00:53:17.903,"If you ever raise a hand to me again, James Fraser, I will cut your heart out and have it for breakfast."
00:53:17.945,00:53:19.195,Do you understand me?
00:53:20.656,00:53:21.699,Do you?
00:53:22.700,00:53:23.534,You have my word.
00:53:38.883,00:53:41.177,You're mine.
00:53:42.094,00:53:44.847,"Mine, now and forever."
00:53:54.272,00:53:56.441,And I mean to make you call me master.
00:54:55.793,00:54:59.671,I am your master and you're mine.
00:55:02.216,00:55:08.847,Seems I canna possess your soul without losing my own.
00:55:34.290,00:55:35.707,Sassenach?
00:55:38.585,00:55:40.045,"Yes, master?"
00:55:41.880,00:55:44.300,What does fucking mean?
00:55:46.844,00:55:48.095,What?
00:55:48.137,00:55:50.848,Fucking.
00:55:50.889,00:55:55.227,"Well, after Fort William, you called me a fucking bastard."
00:55:57.646,00:56:01.399,"Well, that means what we just did."
00:56:02.358,00:56:03.359,Ah.
00:56:04.653,00:56:06.030,What about sadist?
00:56:06.071,00:56:07.865,Ye called me that as well.
00:56:10.034,00:56:16.665,"Well, that means someone who takes sexual pleasure in hurting someone."
00:56:20.418,00:56:22.129,"Oh, well."
00:56:22.171,00:56:27.343,"Ye dinna flatter me overmuch, but I canna fault yer observations."
00:56:38.270,00:56:39.563,Um...
00:56:39.604,00:56:40.731,Oh.
00:56:40.772,00:56:42.398,Was I too rough on you?
00:56:43.650,00:56:48.906,"Well, if you bed a vixen, you have to expect to get bit."
00:56:51.325,00:56:54.245,Come here and bite me some more.
00:57:01.543,00:57:03.128,I'm ravenous.
00:57:03.795,00:57:05.297,So am I.
00:57:13.638,00:57:15.515,You meant food.
00:57:15.557,00:57:17.809,Mmm-hmm.
00:57:17.851,00:57:20.437,"I'll go to the kitchen, fetch us something to eat."
00:57:32.783,00:57:34.368,What on earth is this?
00:57:37.495,00:57:38.538,Where'd ye get that?
00:57:39.497,00:57:41.375,It was just there.
00:57:41.417,00:57:43.335,What's wrong?
00:57:46.004,00:57:47.339,It's an ill-wish.
00:57:49.383,00:57:50.926,Which is?
00:57:53.053,00:57:58.642,It's meant to bring pain or harm or even death.
00:58:00.227,00:58:02.020,Who would put such a thing under our bed?
00:58:04.815,00:58:05.816,Jamie?
00:58:10.988,00:58:12.530,Laoghaire.
00:00:01.376,00:00:02.336,CLAIRE: Previously...
00:00:02.377,00:00:04.212,There's a price on my head for murder.
00:00:04.254,00:00:09.343,CLAIRE: Black Jack was able to commit his various crimes in the Highlands because he was being protected by a powerful man.
00:00:09.384,00:00:11.261,The Duke of Sandringham.
00:00:11.303,00:00:13.806,We were raising money to restore the rightful king.
00:00:16.391,00:00:21.271,"COLUM: Send a missive to the Duke of Sandringham, inviting him to a banquet here in his honor."
00:00:21.313,00:00:26.485,Very wise to get the measure of the Jacobite cause from an Englishman's perspective.
00:00:26.527,00:00:28.904,You should come visit me sometime down in the village.
00:00:28.946,00:00:30.906,I have a cabinet full of potions and medicinals.
00:00:30.948,00:00:33.784,"I need some peppermint, my dearest."
00:00:33.826,00:00:35.911,I have something to offer ye.
00:00:35.953,00:00:38.706,I made a vow.
00:00:38.747,00:00:39.832,CLAIRE: What on earth is this?
00:00:39.874,00:00:42.543,"It's an ill-wish, meant to bring pain or harm."
00:00:42.584,00:00:44.169,"Well, who'd put such a thing under our bed?"
00:00:44.962,00:00:46.045,Laoghaire.
00:03:10.482,00:03:12.191,No. No.
00:03:35.716,00:03:37.342,MURTAGH: Jamie!
00:03:41.680,00:03:42.556,MURTAGH: Wake up!
00:03:45.225,00:03:46.685,"Enough, damn it."
00:03:55.861,00:03:56.611,"MURTAGH: Come on, you lazy dog!"
00:04:02.492,00:04:06.246,"Has my knock grown so feeble, or have yer marriage duties made ye sluggish?"
00:04:11.543,00:04:12.586,Mistress.
00:04:12.627,00:04:14.421,There must be good reason for this visit.
00:04:14.462,00:04:15.881,"Aye, lad, there is."
00:04:15.923,00:04:19.300,The Duke of Sandringham has arrived to take counsel with the laird.
00:04:19.342,00:04:21.803,He's taken up residence in Merlewood House.
00:04:25.849,00:04:27.726,"JAMIE: This is my chance, then."
00:04:27.768,00:04:29.937,"Hell, the Duke has always been partial to me."
00:04:29.978,00:04:31.855,Some would say too much so.
00:04:31.897,00:04:34.024,I'm not about to offer up my hindquarters.
00:04:34.066,00:04:40.114,"But His Grace wields a fair amount of power in court, and if so inclined, he could lift the price on my head."
00:04:40.155,00:04:42.407,"Aye, it's worth the asking."
00:04:42.449,00:04:45.035,Though he's not a man to grant a favor lightly.
00:04:45.077,00:04:47.495,It's not a favor I'm asking.
00:04:47.537,00:04:48.997,I'm an innocent man seeking justice.
00:04:49.039,00:04:51.875,"Justice, from the Duke of Sandringham?"
00:04:51.917,00:04:52.834,The name's familiar to ye?
00:04:53.919,00:04:54.878,I've heard it before.
00:04:56.379,00:05:00.592,"Jamie, if I tell you something, do you promise not to ask how I know?"
00:05:00.634,00:05:03.470,I told ye I'd never ask you for anything ye dinna wish to tell me.
00:05:03.511,00:05:05.931,"Yes, I promise."
00:05:05.973,00:05:09.143,"The Duke, you mustn't trust him."
00:05:14.564,00:05:18.068,"Very attentive to me he was, but that's as far as it went."
00:05:18.110,00:05:20.361,I wasn't aware.
00:05:25.366,00:05:26.827,Did Randall tell ye that?
00:05:29.329,00:05:31.372,You promised.
00:05:31.414,00:05:34.209,We'll both be respecting yer wishes on that account.
00:05:37.671,00:05:39.631,A friend of Jack Randall's can be no friend of yours.
00:05:43.718,00:05:50.184,"Perhaps, before you approach the Duke, it might be worth having a word with Ned Gowan."
00:05:50.225,00:05:52.769,Get his advice in light of this information.
00:05:52.811,00:05:54.479,Aye.
00:05:54.521,00:05:56.190,I'll talk to the lawyer.
00:05:57.774,00:06:02.821,"But, Claire, ye must realize what this means."
00:06:02.863,00:06:07.408,This is my first real opportunity to gain a pardon.
00:06:07.450,00:06:10.245,I can finally return home to Lallybroch.
00:06:10.287,00:06:13.915,Take my rightful place as laird of Broch Tuarach.
00:06:13.957,00:06:15.500,And you can be my lady.
00:06:17.752,00:06:20.421,"We'd be happy there, I know we would."
00:06:25.384,00:06:26.803,As do I.
00:06:29.472,00:06:34.144,"Look, laddie, as it stands now, ye're wanted for murder."
00:06:34.186,00:06:39.733,"Ye can deny this from now till Judgment Day, but it's yer word against Captain Randall."
00:06:39.774,00:06:49.117,"And even with the Duke's backing, I fear that there is no way that a British judge will take yer word over that of one of His Majesty's officers."
00:06:50.785,00:06:53.580,Truth or lies have very little to do with the law.
00:06:54.873,00:06:56.457,Hmm.
00:06:56.499,00:06:57.918,Then there's nothing to be done.
00:06:57.959,00:07:02.672,"No, no, no, no, no."
00:07:02.714,00:07:07.928,You tell me the Duke has close ties to Black Jack?
00:07:17.854,00:07:21.816,"If ye have something on yer mind, Ned Gowan, then speak it."
00:07:21.858,00:07:32.660,"I can draw up a petition of complaint, accusing Randall of crimes against the Scottish people, yer wife included, and of transgressing His Majesty's laws."
00:07:32.702,00:07:43.671,"If you can convince the Duke of Sandringham to deliver that document to the Lord President of the Court of Session, that could lead to a court martial for Black Jack."
00:07:43.713,00:07:47.634,"Or at the very least, a reassignment far from Scottish soil."
00:07:47.675,00:07:50.095,Court martial?
00:07:50.137,00:07:51.972,Can they not just hang the bastard?
00:07:52.013,00:07:57.560,Sweating out the rest of his military career in some West Indies hellhole would be a far greater punishment.
00:07:57.602,00:08:03.566,"With Randall in disgrace, I believe I can take Jamie's case to court and win him a general pardon."
00:08:18.457,00:08:20.625,MRS. FITZ: I just feel like a complete...
00:08:20.667,00:08:22.127,"Here, let me help ye put it on."
00:08:22.169,00:08:24.421,It's so lovely.
00:08:25.130,00:08:30.385,"Claire, do you see what my darling granddaughter here has stitched for me?"
00:08:33.596,00:08:36.016,"Mrs. Fitz, would you mind giving us a few moments?"
00:08:36.057,00:08:38.268,Laoghaire and I have something to discuss.
00:08:38.310,00:08:39.978,Aye.
00:08:40.020,00:08:42.689,"Well, I can see by your face it's a serious matter."
00:08:45.066,00:08:46.485,Can I be of some help?
00:08:46.526,00:08:49.529,"No, thank you."
00:08:50.489,00:08:51.906,"All right, then."
00:08:57.954,00:08:59.373,"Come on, girls."
00:08:59.414,00:09:00.999,Shoo. Shoo.
00:09:04.544,00:09:06.213,"If ye have something to say, say it."
00:09:06.254,00:09:07.714,I have chores to tend to.
00:09:09.007,00:09:10.008,Look familiar?
00:09:11.801,00:09:13.512,Why should it?
00:09:13.553,00:09:16.681,Because you placed it under my bed.
00:09:16.723,00:09:18.433,What cause would I have to do such a thing?
00:09:18.975,00:09:29.444,"Look, I know you have deep feelings for Jamie, and that when tender regard is denied, it can be very hurtful, especially in one so young as yourself."
00:09:29.486,00:09:37.244,"I even understand why your jealousy would be directed at me, even though I never conspired to take Jamie from you."
00:09:37.285,00:09:39.454,The truth is he was never yours to begin with.
00:09:40.455,00:09:41.831,That's a lie.
00:09:42.790,00:09:45.419,Jamie Fraser was and is mine.
00:09:46.503,00:09:49.172,And you did us both a wrong past bearing when you stole him away.
00:09:52.342,00:09:59.140,"My poor Jamie, trapped in a loveless marriage, forced to share his bed with a cold English bitch."
00:09:59.182,00:10:02.561,He must have to get himself swine drunk every night before he can stand to plow your field.
00:10:08.400,00:10:10.485,I shouldn't have done that.
00:10:10.527,00:10:11.611,Sorry.
00:10:17.325,00:10:25.792,"Aye, I did put that ill-wish 'neath yer bed in the hope it would make Jamie hate ye as much as I do."
00:10:25.833,00:10:28.795,"He belongs with me, and one day, it will be so."
00:10:28.836,00:10:31.839,"Well, I hope the price you paid wasn't too dear, because that will never happen."
00:10:31.881,00:10:33.633,Ye're wrong.
00:10:33.674,00:10:37.845,Ye're wrong about Jamie just as ye're wrong about yer friend Geillis.
00:10:37.887,00:10:39.931,It was she who sold me the ill-wish.
00:10:44.561,00:10:46.646,Good.
00:10:46.687,00:10:50.609,Just stay away from me and my husband.
00:11:02.036,00:11:05.499,"If you're looking for my wife, she's not here."
00:11:05.540,00:11:07.000,Wench never is when I need her.
00:11:10.420,00:11:12.547,Raw turnips never agree with me.
00:11:12.589,00:11:14.007,I could use some of my wife's tonic.
00:11:15.300,00:11:17.927,Oh! Stuff and nonsense!
00:11:17.969,00:11:21.473,"My sweet lamb, where are you?"
00:11:26.561,00:11:29.314,"Here, fennel should give him some temporary relief."
00:11:32.733,00:11:34.861,"Damn it all, Jeanie, bring me my chamber pot."
00:11:34.902,00:11:37.071,"Go on, on you go!"
00:11:37.113,00:11:40.200,I should be going.
00:11:43.119,00:11:45.413,It be a full moon tonight.
00:11:45.455,00:11:49.959,"Seek Mistress Duncan in the woods, north of the foothills in the hours before dawn."
00:11:50.001,00:11:51.545,Jeanie!
00:11:51.586,00:11:53.754,"The chamber pot, damn you!"
00:12:09.312,00:12:10.771,GEILLIS: Release.
00:12:14.275,00:12:15.734,Goddess...
00:12:20.365,00:12:21.740,Earth Mother.
00:12:24.244,00:12:25.953,Open the gates.
00:12:28.373,00:12:30.709,I praise thee.
00:12:58.570,00:13:00.572,Rise from the fires.
00:14:03.718,00:14:05.844,"You can come out now, Claire."
00:14:17.524,00:14:21.361,"But then again, I always like to imagine someone's watching me."
00:14:24.572,00:14:26.783,"You could have joined me, you know."
00:14:26.825,00:14:28.618,But you English are a prudish people.
00:14:33.414,00:14:36.417,"Yes, you looked like you were enjoying yourself just fine."
00:14:36.459,00:14:39.629,'Twas the icy wind whispering over my nipples.
00:14:40.755,00:14:42.882,Makes them harden like acorns.
00:14:43.675,00:14:45.218,So I can see.
00:14:47.470,00:14:48.513,And you're pregnant.
00:14:50.515,00:14:51.891,Congratulations.
00:14:53.017,00:14:54.477,Thank you.
00:14:54.519,00:14:57.647,It's been my own special secret for months now.
00:14:57.689,00:14:58.939,Not even Arthur knows.
00:15:00.441,00:15:02.485,"You must be joking, surely."
00:15:02.527,00:15:03.820,How's that possible?
00:15:09.950,00:15:12.370,Certainly not in daylight.
00:15:15.456,00:15:19.377,I thought you two weren't having intimate relations.
00:15:23.757,00:15:25.216,I have a lover.
00:15:27.176,00:15:28.803,Anyone I know?
00:15:29.554,00:15:30.889,Aye.
00:15:32.891,00:15:34.434,"Well, must I guess?"
00:15:38.187,00:15:40.189,It's Dougal MacKenzie.
00:15:44.694,00:15:46.613,I know what ye're thinking.
00:15:52.911,00:15:55.663,A child would certainly be awkward.
00:15:55.705,00:15:57.874,The bairn won't be born for months yet.
00:15:57.916,00:16:01.127,Plenty of time for the summoning to prove fruitful.
00:16:03.379,00:16:05.590,Is that what I witnessed?
00:16:05.632,00:16:08.885,"A summoning, what, of some pagan spirit?"
00:16:10.261,00:16:15.266,"Mother Nature, of course, to ask for our freedom, Dougal's and mine."
00:16:21.355,00:16:22.649,Not tell anyone.
00:16:22.690,00:16:24.984,"Not just about the child, about what you saw tonight."
00:16:28.905,00:16:30.156,I understand.
00:16:33.743,00:16:34.911,I knew ye would.
00:16:36.496,00:16:39.624,"Come on, let's put out the fires."
00:16:47.340,00:16:52.303,"I promise ye, Claire, if I'd known it was for you, I would have never sold Laoghaire the ill-wish."
00:16:53.513,00:16:59.018,"Ye could do a lot worse to me if ye wanted, now that I've shared all my secrets with you."
00:17:01.688,00:17:04.231,"Look, I have no wish to do you harm."
00:17:04.273,00:17:06.484,You're my friend.
00:17:06.526,00:17:10.571,"The only one I've made since I've arrived here, in this part of Scotland."
00:17:12.657,00:17:14.784,I feel much the same.
00:17:14.826,00:17:17.954,If it wasn't for you and my darling Dougal...
00:17:20.289,00:17:21.833,"Beautiful, is it not?"
00:17:23.001,00:17:24.794,Dougal gave you this?
00:17:24.836,00:17:33.636,"The Duke of Sandringham himself presented it to him for that slag of a wife, A trinket like this would be wasted on the likes of her."
00:17:33.678,00:17:36.055,So he gave it to me.
00:17:39.976,00:17:41.728,Aye.
00:17:41.769,00:17:46.024,But his wife has been holed up in that estate of theirs for years.
00:17:46.065,00:17:47.358,She's not one for public gatherings.
00:17:48.985,00:17:52.864,"Don't blame her, she with such a homely countenance."
00:17:55.241,00:17:58.327,You say it was a present from the Duke?
00:18:02.122,00:18:06.669,"He meets with Colum, but it's Dougal he's fond of."
00:18:08.254,00:18:10.506,"CLAIRE: At first, I found it puzzling."
00:18:10.548,00:18:17.430,"An English Lord, a friend of Black Jack Randall, on such good terms with a known Jacobite like Dougal MacKenzie."
00:18:17.471,00:18:20.266,But then I remembered something that Frank had said.
00:18:25.730,00:18:27.607,"FRANK: Yes, possibly."
00:18:27.648,00:18:31.444,It would had to have been someone high up in the hierarchy of the time to exert that kind of influence.
00:18:31.485,00:18:32.695,"Oh, aye."
00:18:32.737,00:18:34.154,What about the Duke of Sandringham?
00:18:35.531,00:18:37.533,The Duke of Sandringham.
00:18:37.575,00:18:40.036,Wasn't Sandringham a suspected Jacobite himself?
00:18:40.078,00:18:41.829,"Aye. You know, I believe you're right."
00:18:43.748,00:18:47.085,"CLAIRE: Odd indeed, but well worth keeping in mind."
00:18:50.337,00:18:51.422,What was that?
00:18:52.924,00:18:54.133,Nothing.
00:18:56.469,00:18:59.847,"No, listen, it's a baby."
00:18:59.889,00:19:02.141,"Claire, that's a fairy hill."
00:19:09.023,00:19:11.191,What the hell are you talking about?
00:19:11.233,00:19:16.739,"When the fairies steal a human child away, they leave one of their own in its place."
00:19:16.781,00:19:20.118,You know it's a changeling because it doesn't thrive and grow.
00:19:20.159,00:19:22.745,That's just superstitious nonsense.
00:19:22.787,00:19:29.836,"If ye leave a changeling out overnight in such a place, the wee folk will come and take it back and return the child they've stolen."
00:19:29.877,00:19:34.465,"They won't, because it's not a changeling, it's just a sick child."
00:19:34.507,00:19:36.717,It might very well not survive a night out in the open.
00:19:36.759,00:19:38.177,I have to go.
00:19:39.804,00:19:41.263,"You go yourself, then, and good luck to you."
00:20:32.565,00:20:33.733,"Oh, God."
00:20:37.945,00:20:39.238,"Oh, God."
00:20:49.207,00:20:50.249,"Oh, you poor child."
00:20:56.589,00:20:58.049,I'm sorry.
00:20:59.717,00:21:01.301,I'm so sorry.
00:21:34.501,00:21:35.753,JAMIE: Sassenach.
00:21:42.760,00:21:47.014,"I came up here, but I was too late."
00:21:49.267,00:21:51.102,The baby was already gone.
00:21:52.478,00:21:54.313,They just left it out here to die.
00:21:55.564,00:21:56.565,Aye.
00:21:59.610,00:22:00.903,I know.
00:22:04.240,00:22:09.536,"You've a kind heart, but ye've no idea what ye're dealing with."
00:22:11.080,00:22:12.123,Show.
00:22:15.793,00:22:17.003,Come.
00:22:27.972,00:22:29.556,Been looking all over for ye.
00:22:31.349,00:22:33.811,I met Geillis Duncan on the road.
00:22:37.064,00:22:38.691,She told me where ye were.
00:22:42.987,00:22:45.823,"It's dangerous to be out here alone, Sassenach."
00:22:45.865,00:22:50.203,Don't tell me you believe in fairies and changelings and all that.
00:22:50.244,00:22:52.246,It's not about what I believe.
00:22:53.706,00:22:59.337,"These people, they've never been more than a day's walk from the place they were born."
00:23:01.797,00:23:06.384,They hear no more of the world than what Father Bain tells them in the kirk on a Sunday.
00:23:09.347,00:23:17.395,"And for the parents of that child, it might comfort them a bit to think it's the changeling that died."
00:23:19.315,00:23:24.528,"And think of their own child, healthy and well, living forever with the fairies."
00:23:32.036,00:23:33.411,Take me home.
00:23:41.628,00:23:44.422,"JAMIE: According to Ned, how did he put it?"
00:23:56.894,00:23:58.229,"That's good, isn't it?"
00:23:58.687,00:23:59.605,Hmm.
00:24:01.274,00:24:03.441,"Sign yer name, just below mine."
00:24:11.909,00:24:13.953,I know ye have yer doubts about Sandringham.
00:24:15.121,00:24:20.084,"Well, I don't question the truth of them, but ye have to try, Claire."
00:24:20.126,00:24:21.459,For us.
00:24:27.007,00:24:28.466,For Lallybroch.
00:24:50.864,00:24:51.740,Scotland.
00:24:56.870,00:24:59.832,I suppose it will have to do.
00:25:01.583,00:25:03.419,Scribble.
00:25:03.461,00:25:06.380,"I'm sorry, madam, you were saying?"
00:25:06.422,00:25:08.382,Captain Jonathan Randall.
00:25:08.424,00:25:10.508,"Yes, of course."
00:25:14.221,00:25:19.601,"By Christ, a petition of complaint against Captain Randall?"
00:25:19.643,00:25:25.858,I'm told that said Captain is one of the finest officers in the regiment.
00:25:25.899,00:25:28.944,Come... Let me see this abominable document.
00:25:28.986,00:25:31.529,My husband will be presenting it to you later today.
00:25:31.571,00:25:33.240,Ah.
00:25:33.282,00:25:43.583,"So, Lord Broch Tuarach has sent you along to soften me up, to play on my well-known sympathies for the weaker sex?"
00:25:45.211,00:25:48.755,"I can assure you, Your Grace, Jamie has no idea I'm here."
00:25:48.797,00:25:51.509,Nor would he approve if he did.
00:25:51.549,00:25:53.177,By my word.
00:25:53.219,00:25:55.304,He's picked a feisty wife.
00:25:55.346,00:25:57.723,I would expect nothing less of the lad.
00:25:57.764,00:26:07.233,"Make no mistake, I am very fond of Jamie, but I'm afraid I must refuse this outrageous proposal."
00:26:07.274,00:26:09.360,Will you go away?
00:26:09.402,00:26:11.070,I understand your reluctance.
00:26:11.111,00:26:15.032,To turn against one's friend is no easy thing.
00:26:16.242,00:26:17.951,Friend?
00:26:19.495,00:26:22.456,"Even if it were so, what of it?"
00:26:22.498,00:26:29.171,"An English nobleman befriending one of His Majesty's most valued officers, that's scarcely inimical to either of our reputations."
00:26:29.213,00:26:38.931,"Look, my dear, you're a most alluring woman, and I'm sure you will bear Jamie many beautiful children, but my time is not my own these days."
00:26:38.972,00:26:41.308,So many goings-on.
00:26:41.350,00:26:45.854,I certainly have no time to review these libelous falsities.
00:26:46.522,00:26:47.856,That's very good.
00:26:47.898,00:26:50.317,"Write that down, would you?"
00:26:50.359,00:26:52.403,"Forgive me, I'm thinking of writing a book."
00:26:52.445,00:26:58.616,"Aphorisms of the Most Worthy and Most Witty, Clarence Marylebone III, Duke of Sandringham."
00:26:59.617,00:27:02.079,Memorable.
00:27:02.121,00:27:04.164,I believe you've said what you came to say?
00:27:12.131,00:27:15.926,"Before I go, there is one question I hope you'll answer."
00:27:15.968,00:27:21.807,How could I refuse just one question to so fair a lady?
00:27:21.848,00:27:25.102,How much Jacobite gold did Dougal MacKenzie pass along to you?
00:27:31.442,00:27:38.115,"Madam, it's a dangerous thing to hurl slanderous charges with such reckless abandon."
00:27:38.157,00:27:40.618,They're only slanderous if untrue.
00:27:40.658,00:27:42.786,You determined to make me your enemy?
00:27:42.828,00:27:46.582,"On the contrary, I need you as my friend."
00:27:46.624,00:27:55.508,"And I trust my friendship, no matter how lowly obtained, is preferable to a date with the gallows as a traitor to your King."
00:27:55.549,00:27:59.261,"Has anyone ever told you, you have the most gorgeous neck?"
00:27:59.303,00:28:02.389,It holds your head so prettily.
00:28:02.431,00:28:04.475,I'd hate to see them parted.
00:28:10.523,00:28:11.773,Mark that.
00:28:16.736,00:28:19.532,I don't want to be over-hasty about Jamie.
00:28:19.573,00:28:21.741,I'm really so fond of him.
00:28:21.783,00:28:25.371,"He's such a good lad, stout-hearted."
00:28:25.412,00:28:27.665,His grievances deserve to be heard.
00:28:31.251,00:28:34.712,To petitions of complaint.
00:28:34.754,00:28:39.593,I look forward to helping your husband to restore his good name.
00:28:51.188,00:28:52.272,RUPERT: Claire!
00:28:52.314,00:28:53.815,Claire!
00:28:53.857,00:28:54.816,The laird is asking for ye.
00:28:57.444,00:28:59.154,It's Dougal.
00:28:59.196,00:29:02.741,He's just learned that his wife's perished from a sudden illness and he's gone raging drunk.
00:29:02.782,00:29:04.159,"Well, how? What happened?"
00:29:04.201,00:29:05.578,A fever it was.
00:29:05.619,00:29:07.787,The messenger said it consumed her in a day.
00:29:07.829,00:29:09.623,Burned her up as if by fire.
00:29:12.418,00:29:13.919,"Well, what does Colum want me to do?"
00:29:13.960,00:29:17.047,Soothe the mad beast with one of those sedatives of yours.
00:29:22.344,00:29:23.887,Get back.
00:29:23.929,00:29:25.598,Get back!
00:29:31.937,00:29:33.063,No!
00:29:40.279,00:29:42.781,Yes. Do you have something to put it in?
00:29:44.658,00:29:47.786,DOUGAL: Dire mischance the day she wedded me.
00:29:49.329,00:29:50.789,Poor lass.
00:29:52.040,00:29:55.419,"It's my fault, all of it."
00:29:56.629,00:29:58.297,All my fault!
00:30:05.804,00:30:08.599,Stay back! All of ye!
00:30:09.933,00:30:11.685,Or I'll slice yer ears!
00:30:14.229,00:30:15.522,Hey!
00:30:21.111,00:30:22.571,Away.
00:30:23.905,00:30:25.824,Or I'll strike yer head from yer shoulders.
00:30:27.033,00:30:28.952,"Easy, man."
00:30:28.994,00:30:32.205,I just...
00:30:36.918,00:30:38.545,"Aye, aye, aye."
00:30:40.088,00:30:41.674,Aye.
00:30:41.715,00:30:44.635,I'd drown my sorrows if I could.
00:30:46.094,00:30:47.513,This will quiet him down.
00:30:51.099,00:30:53.811,How're you going to get him to take it?
00:30:53.852,00:30:55.103,What makes you think he'd refuse?
00:30:57.648,00:30:59.149,Get off me!
00:30:59.191,00:31:00.275,Come on!
00:31:00.317,00:31:01.860,Hey! Come on!
00:31:53.912,00:32:01.587,"Not even a blind man would think she was bonnie, but she deserved better than me."
00:32:24.568,00:32:26.445,Hard-pressed to stand.
00:32:38.957,00:32:41.501,Don't be leaving him lying on the floor there.
00:32:45.464,00:32:47.549,Watch over him.
00:32:47.591,00:32:51.970,I will deal with the sodden fool when he regains sobriety!
00:32:56.266,00:32:57.392,Easy.
00:32:57.434,00:32:59.978,"If ye drop him, I'll have yer balls."
00:33:12.198,00:33:13.032,Claire.
00:33:16.787,00:33:19.623,Have you heard about Maura?
00:33:20.624,00:33:21.875,Can you believe it?
00:33:21.917,00:33:24.127,"Yes, I've heard."
00:33:24.169,00:33:27.297,"Though it doesn't put the same smile on my face, if that's what you're hoping."
00:33:28.632,00:33:30.216,"It's a tragedy, no doubt."
00:33:30.258,00:33:32.093,God rest her soul.
00:33:32.135,00:33:36.014,But surely ye won't begrudge me a wee bit of celebration?
00:33:36.055,00:33:38.684,"After all, my prayers have been answered."
00:33:38.725,00:33:43.563,"You don't really believe it had anything to do with that summoning of yours, do you?"
00:33:43.605,00:33:47.359,"I don't know that it did, and I don't know that it did not."
00:33:47.400,00:33:49.152,And neither do you.
00:33:55.659,00:33:59.204,Now Dougal and I can be together.
00:33:59.245,00:34:02.040,I think your husband might have something to say about that.
00:34:36.033,00:34:39.285,What the hell are the MacDonalds doing visiting the Duke of Sandringham?
00:34:53.383,00:34:58.013,I had no idea my acquaintanceship with Captain Randall was such common knowledge.
00:34:58.055,00:35:00.139,"Well, know it we do."
00:35:00.181,00:35:04.061,And I have no doubt it's whispered about in Your Majesty's court as well.
00:35:04.102,00:35:07.313,"Our Majesty's court, you mean, of course."
00:35:08.023,00:35:09.148,"Leave us, Minou."
00:35:09.482,00:35:10.692,Leave.
00:35:14.571,00:35:16.114,Damn that Randall!
00:35:17.616,00:35:25.624,I must admit that shielding him from the consequences of his misdeeds sometimes feels like a full-time occupation.
00:35:25.665,00:35:28.710,And I loathe work.
00:35:28.752,00:35:32.213,But it will require a good deal of delicacy.
00:35:32.255,00:35:35.133,"After all, I must damn the Captain without damning myself."
00:35:36.175,00:35:37.218,Of course.
00:35:39.137,00:35:40.806,It could be done.
00:35:40.847,00:35:46.853,"However, Jamie, favors must be returned in kind."
00:35:46.895,00:35:52.734,"If I scrub your back, I'd expect you to see that mine was equally spotless."
00:35:54.569,00:35:56.529,I've been challenged to a duel.
00:35:57.656,00:35:59.032,"By the MacDonalds, you mean?"
00:35:59.074,00:36:01.076,"Ah, you saw them leave the house, yes?"
00:36:01.118,00:36:03.369,Andrew MacDonald.
00:36:03.411,00:36:07.582,Some nonsense about an unpaid debt.
00:36:07.624,00:36:09.918,I've never been able to turn my back on a game of maw.
00:36:09.960,00:36:11.962,Pity I'm not better at it.
00:36:12.004,00:36:15.715,"Anyway, this is an affair of honor."
00:36:15.757,00:36:19.260,"Shots will be exchanged, but I understand no one will be hurt."
00:36:19.302,00:36:20.470,MURTAGH: Hmm.
00:36:20.512,00:36:24.766,"When the MacDonalds are involved, there's always a chance that blood will be spilt."
00:36:24.808,00:36:29.938,"Yes, I know the MacDonalds and MacKenzies are sworn enemies, but this is not a clan matter."
00:36:29.980,00:36:32.440,I myself will be in the line of fire.
00:36:32.482,00:36:37.362,All that I require from Jamie is that he appears as my second.
00:36:37.403,00:36:42.951,"Alas, my servants are chosen for their beauty, not their belligerence."
00:36:42.993,00:36:49.415,"You, of course, contain within you a sublime combination of the two."
00:36:53.461,00:36:56.048,"This is no good, Jamie."
00:36:57.549,00:36:59.801,You suggested I approach Sandringham in the first place.
00:36:59.843,00:37:02.345,I'd have kept my mouth shut if I knew he'd lead ye to the MacDonalds.
00:37:02.387,00:37:09.186,"I'm not feeling blithe about it myself, but if I back out now, I lose my chance to return to Lallybroch a free man."
00:37:09.227,00:37:11.771,There will be other chances.
00:37:11.813,00:37:15.067,Can you swear to it?
00:37:18.277,00:37:19.237,"Well, it's a risk I have to take."
00:38:32.894,00:38:42.695,"Clan MacKenzie welcomes our longtime friend and ally, His Grace, the Duke of Sandringham."
00:38:42.737,00:38:46.116,It is our honor to share our bounty with him.
00:38:46.158,00:38:49.368,Always a pleasure to visit Clan MacKenzie!
00:38:50.162,00:38:51.830,God bless Scotland!
00:38:51.871,00:38:53.290,God bless the King.
00:38:58.670,00:39:00.338,They make quite the trio.
00:39:00.379,00:39:02.799,"Aye, certainly."
00:39:02.841,00:39:05.510,Colum and the Duke appear to be in fine spirits.
00:39:24.612,00:39:28.366,"Let me guess, this must be Mrs. Fraser?"
00:39:29.701,00:39:34.372,"Claire, allow me to introduce His Grace, the Duke of Sandringham."
00:39:40.461,00:39:44.966,"Jamie, if you wouldn't mind getting me something to drink while the Duke and I get better acquainted?"
00:39:45.008,00:39:46.759,Of course. Excuse me.
00:39:50.429,00:39:52.098,You bastard.
00:39:54.433,00:39:57.436,Merely a quid pro quo.
00:39:57.478,00:39:59.731,Simply means this for that.
00:40:07.739,00:40:15.538,"Your concern for your husband is commendable, but may I point out that it is I that will be faced with the disagreeable end of a pistol."
00:40:15.580,00:40:22.712,"So you'd better hope that nothing happens to me, or this petition of your husband's will never reach London."
00:40:58.373,00:41:00.499,Help me turn him to his side.
00:41:15.014,00:41:16.182,Put him back down.
00:41:38.537,00:41:41.291,CLAIRE: I reluctantly searched the crowd for my friend.
00:41:41.333,00:41:45.337,"However, what I found was anything but a grieving widow."
00:41:59.309,00:42:03.021,It was then I noticed traces of a peculiar odor.
00:42:03.062,00:42:04.939,Bitter almonds.
00:42:04.981,00:42:09.277,The same smell you'd find resulting from a dose of cyanide.
00:42:09.319,00:42:12.989,And I knew straightaway what had caused Arthur Duncan's sudden demise.
00:42:16.784,00:42:18.536,He'd been poisoned.
00:42:38.390,00:42:43.061,"Gentlemen, upon my count, five paces, if ye please."
00:42:44.187,00:42:46.105,One. Two.
00:42:47.023,00:42:48.607,Three. Four.
00:42:49.734,00:42:51.236,Five. Halt.
00:42:52.070,00:42:53.405,Mark yer places.
00:42:57.116,00:42:59.577,"Combatants, take yer positions."
00:43:15.968,00:43:20.014,"Combatants, you will fire upon the dropping of the handkerchief."
00:43:20.848,00:43:21.599,Are you ready?
00:43:27.480,00:43:28.940,Aim your weapons.
00:43:39.200,00:43:40.285,"MAN: Steady, steady."
00:43:44.914,00:43:48.126,Does the Duke of Sandringham offer his apology for non-payment of debt?
00:43:48.960,00:43:50.545,I do.
00:43:50.587,00:43:52.964,And does Andrew MacDonald accept said apology?
00:43:53.465,00:43:54.549,I do.
00:43:55.967,00:43:58.136,Then this affair is concluded.
00:43:59.053,00:44:01.347,Let's drink to friendship.
00:44:02.348,00:44:05.893,Honor observed and restored.
00:44:05.935,00:44:08.062,Honor is a poor substitute for coin.
00:44:08.104,00:44:10.356,"I, for one, refuse to drink with mollies."
00:44:10.398,00:44:14.110,"Off with ye, go and couple together like the filthy dogs ye are!"
00:44:14.152,00:44:16.488,"Sir, order your boys to hold their tongues."
00:44:16.529,00:44:19.282,"Let it go, lads."
00:44:19.324,00:44:22.952,"Father, the man rents a great house but canna pay an honest debt?"
00:44:22.994,00:44:26.122,"Tell me, is the Duke's fat arse as comforting as a woman's cunny?"
00:44:26.164,00:44:30.001,"Aye, is yours stretched like some crone's sagging teats?"
00:44:30.042,00:44:31.544,"I said enough, ye whelps."
00:44:33.296,00:44:36.715,"Come, come, Jamie, let's not descend to calling of names."
00:44:36.757,00:44:38.801,"Aye, into the woods, you go."
00:44:38.843,00:44:40.970,To find a fallen log to bend each other over!
00:44:41.012,00:44:44.056,Is it true the MacDonalds learn of love by rutting with their mother?
00:44:48.520,00:44:49.646,ANDREW: Alexander!
00:45:26.891,00:45:31.145,"So sorry, I'm so desperately sorry."
00:45:33.314,00:45:36.150,Nothing to be alarmed about.
00:45:36.192,00:45:38.944,Do tell your wife it wasn't my fault.
00:45:38.986,00:45:41.364,"And now, I'm afraid, I must be on my way."
00:45:41.406,00:45:45.159,"A duel is one thing, a common brawl, quite another."
00:45:46.077,00:45:47.704,Concern yourself not.
00:46:07.348,00:46:10.351,"'Tis but one more scar, Sassenach."
00:46:10.393,00:46:11.852,Nothing worth brooding over.
00:46:14.647,00:46:17.816,And the Duke did take the petition.
00:46:17.858,00:46:19.985,That's cause for a bit of celebrating.
00:46:23.573,00:46:29.786,Now perhaps it is better to wait until closer to our leaving.
00:46:35.293,00:46:37.462,"Ye're not normally a closed-mouth woman, Claire."
00:46:38.879,00:46:41.090,I expected noisier displeasure.
00:46:45.261,00:46:47.804,But quiet anger can be very effective.
00:46:50.224,00:46:53.519,"Jamie, the laird is asking for you."
00:46:57.148,00:47:00.276,COLUM: You will return to your home and attend to your wife's funeral.
00:47:00.318,00:47:03.696,And at home you will remain until I send for you.
00:47:04.405,00:47:05.740,Ye're exiling me.
00:47:07.158,00:47:09.702,How long?
00:47:09.744,00:47:11.663,If you are even capable of such a thing.
00:47:11.704,00:47:13.080,Ye're asking me to do what I canna.
00:47:13.122,00:47:17.251,"I'm not asking ye to do anything, you half-wit, I am ordering you!"
00:47:21.297,00:47:24.049,"Oh, neither would her husband, and you see what she did to him!"
00:47:24.091,00:47:26.678,That bloated bastard's been dying for years.
00:47:30.765,00:47:33.892,"By Christ, ye actually love the bitch."
00:47:33.934,00:47:35.978,Or ye're an even bigger numskull than I thought.
00:47:38.272,00:47:40.316,I do love her.
00:47:40.358,00:47:41.693,And with just cause.
00:47:43.653,00:47:47.532,"Brother, she's carrying my child."
00:47:48.741,00:47:50.368,Yer child?
00:47:51.202,00:47:53.162,Yer child?
00:47:53.204,00:47:55.498,need I tell ye how children are conceived?
00:47:55.540,00:47:58.000,"No, no, no, no, no."
00:47:58.042,00:47:59.084,It's Arthur Duncan's child.
00:48:00.919,00:48:02.879,Just as Hamish is my child.
00:48:04.006,00:48:05.591,Aye.
00:48:05.633,00:48:11.639,"And if ye think ye're going to be marrying that evil temptress, ye're very sadly mistaken, sadly so."
00:48:13.432,00:48:15.267,Ye will leave this castle today.
00:48:15.309,00:48:18.354,"Angus, Rupert and this one, they will accompany you."
00:48:18.396,00:48:19.522,You haud yer gab.
00:48:19.564,00:48:21.232,You will speak when you are spoken to.
00:48:24.652,00:48:28.447,"Now, on no account will ye stop and say goodbye to yer whore."
00:48:29.782,00:48:35.204,"After the funeral, you and yer companions, ye can do whatever ye like."
00:48:45.423,00:48:46.465,Um.
00:48:55.099,00:48:59.936,Do ye not even have a nod to acknowledge the orders of yer laird?
00:49:13.451,00:49:16.036,Jamie Fraser.
00:49:16.078,00:49:19.373,How dare you shed MacDonald blood without my approbation!
00:49:19.415,00:49:21.834,I had no desire to cross swords with the MacDonalds...
00:49:23.586,00:49:30.259,But the Duke of Sandringham requested that I accompany him as payment for his aid in winning...
00:49:27.632,00:49:32.511,"I'm not interested in yer stories, yer plots, yer bloody wounds!"
00:49:32.553,00:49:34.639,I'm sorry if I have disappointed ye.
00:49:34.680,00:49:36.265,No disrespect was intended.
00:49:37.767,00:49:42.772,"But if you think so poorly of me, ye'll be pleased to ken I'll soon be returning to my home at Lallybroch."
00:49:42.814,00:49:48.985,"In time, ye can do what ye want, but not until I give my permission."
00:49:50.655,00:49:53.990,"Now, until then, ye'll stick close to my brother."
00:49:55.992,00:50:00.748,You see to it that he follows my orders in all matters.
00:50:08.380,00:50:09.674,I see no reason...
00:50:23.228,00:50:24.522,Now go.
00:50:54.343,00:50:57.722,I hate that you're traveling with an open wound and I won't be there to tend to you.
00:50:57.763,00:51:04.102,"No need to fret, lass, ye already packed me enough fresh bandages to cover me from face to feet."
00:51:08.440,00:51:10.526,Claire.
00:51:10.568,00:51:14.363,"Afore I go, I'll advise ye to stay well clear of Geillis Duncan."
00:51:16.365,00:51:19.117,"Do you think Colum intends to punish her, too?"
00:51:24.040,00:51:28.252,"Loveless or not, her marriage to the fiscal kept her safe."
00:51:28.293,00:51:30.629,"With Arthur gone, there'll be no one to protect her from her own reputation."
00:51:34.967,00:51:37.219,Aye.
00:51:37.261,00:51:39.430,There'll be no one to save her from Colum's ire.
00:51:42.307,00:51:44.060,"Stay away from her, Claire."
00:51:44.100,00:51:45.519,"DOUGAL: Kiss your bride goodbye, Jamie."
00:51:46.353,00:51:48.146,The others await us.
00:51:48.188,00:51:51.525,I want to put some hard miles between me and my brother before nightfall.
00:51:56.030,00:51:58.574,"These are dangerous times, mo nighean donn."
00:51:58.616,00:51:59.784,Be careful.
00:52:01.535,00:52:02.912,I will.
00:52:14.465,00:52:16.508,"I said kiss her, dinna swallow her."
00:52:29.021,00:52:31.147,"Come back to me, James Fraser."
00:52:36.236,00:52:37.947,As soon as I can.
00:53:20.489,00:53:23.951,"I'm sorry, my dear."
00:53:23.993,00:53:25.744,Thought a wee bit of salve might help.
00:53:27.705,00:53:29.748,It's no bother.
00:53:29.790,00:53:31.917,I do wish you'd take more care around the ovens.
00:53:31.959,00:53:33.169,That's the second burn this week.
00:53:33.209,00:53:35.504,I'd call that a very good week.
00:53:39.591,00:53:41.217,"Ooh, now."
00:53:42.678,00:53:48.184,"Dinna fash yerself, it's not a permanent situation, ye ken."
00:53:48.224,00:53:53.229,Jamie will appease his laird best he can and be back in his good graces in no time.
00:53:55.858,00:53:57.818,"In your arms, as well."
00:54:01.864,00:54:03.239,"Thank you, Mrs. Fitz."
00:54:03.782,00:54:04.992,TAMMAS: Auntie.
00:54:05.034,00:54:07.036,Madam Fraser.
00:54:07.078,00:54:12.041,"A letter has arrived for you, madam, from the village."
00:54:23.468,00:54:24.260,Hah.
00:54:39.401,00:54:42.029,"Geillis, I came as quickly as I could."
00:54:42.071,00:54:43.155,Claire.
00:54:44.615,00:54:45.657,Your letter.
00:54:45.699,00:54:46.658,What letter?
00:54:47.952,00:54:49.327,The one you sent.
00:54:53.707,00:54:56.001,'Twas not me who sent it.
00:54:56.043,00:54:58.921,"Suspect someone's playing a prank on you, Claire."
00:54:58.963,00:55:01.257,I was just about to go downstairs to dinner.
00:55:01.297,00:55:03.968,"Jeanie, ye can set the table for two."
00:55:04.009,00:55:05.761,"Geillis, this is no prank."
00:55:07.345,00:55:08.722,You must leave here now.
00:55:09.723,00:55:12.143,Leave? And go where?
00:55:12.184,00:55:13.685,Wherever you choose.
00:55:13.727,00:55:15.395,"Well, that's a comfort."
00:55:20.692,00:55:23.070,"Geillis, drop the pretense."
00:55:23.112,00:55:26.364,I know you poisoned your husband and I'm not the only one.
00:55:26.406,00:55:28.324,"What a thing to say, Claire."
00:55:29.493,00:55:31.203,It's positively cruel.
00:55:32.204,00:55:33.705,Not as cruel as Colum will be.
00:55:35.124,00:55:40.212,"If you care for your baby, then you will pack some belongings and you will flee here."
00:55:40.254,00:55:42.214,We can argue the why of it later.
00:55:43.715,00:55:46.342,"Your concern touches my heart, but it's misplaced."
00:55:54.101,00:55:55.102,Is it?
00:55:56.812,00:55:58.022,WARDEN: Open up!
00:55:58.063,00:55:59.982,Who's there?
00:56:03.694,00:56:04.903,Mistress?
00:56:04.945,00:56:06.446,There are wardens here to see ye!
00:56:06.488,00:56:08.324,WARDEN: Open this door now!
00:56:08.364,00:56:10.993,Do not let her answer that door.
00:56:11.035,00:56:13.578,You can escape through the kitchen.
00:56:13.620,00:56:15.080,I'll meet you in the glade later tonight.
00:56:16.707,00:56:18.334,Like a thief in the night?
00:56:18.374,00:56:21.253,I won't have it.
00:56:21.295,00:56:22.420,WARDEN 2: This is official business!
00:56:22.462,00:56:25.049,We demand to see Mistress Duncan right away.
00:56:26.050,00:56:28.635,Open up!
00:56:28.677,00:56:30.929,Dougal will never allow anything to happen to me.
00:56:33.557,00:56:34.892,To us.
00:56:37.769,00:56:38.729,Jeanie!
00:56:41.940,00:56:43.441,WARDEN 1: Geillis Duncan!
00:56:46.402,00:56:47.445,He made me a promise.
00:56:47.487,00:56:48.655,WARDEN 1: Take us to your mistress.
00:56:48.697,00:56:51.700,The man loves me to death.
00:56:51.742,00:56:54.410,"Geillis Duncan, ye're under arrest for witchcraft."
00:56:56.705,00:56:59.041,Under whose orders?
00:56:59.083,00:57:00.959,The other sorceress.
00:57:01.001,00:57:02.211,It's the thieves' hole for the both of ye.
00:57:02.253,00:57:03.921,What on earth have I done?
00:57:03.962,00:57:05.421,You'll hear all about it at the trial.
00:57:10.802,00:57:11.803,Let's go.
00:57:13.055,00:57:14.890,Get your hands off me!
00:57:15.974,00:57:18.643,Stop! Get off me!
00:57:18.685,00:57:22.356,Ye'll not be casting any spells on us tonight.
00:57:22.398,00:57:24.900,"Aye, ye're a feisty little witch, I'll give ye that."
00:57:42.542,00:57:43.668,WARDEN: Hah! Yah!
00:00:01.251,00:00:02.294,CLAIRE: Previously...
00:00:02.336,00:00:04.379,They say I'm a witch.
00:00:08.884,00:00:11.136,I smell the vapors of hell on you.
00:00:17.893,00:00:20.604,I have a lover.
00:00:20.646,00:00:21.939,It's Dougal MacKenzie.
00:00:21.981,00:00:23.565,She's carrying my child.
00:00:23.607,00:00:25.275,Ye will leave this castle today.
00:00:25.317,00:00:26.318,Ye're exiling me.
00:00:28.320,00:00:30.113,JAMIE: I'd advise ye to stay clear of Geillis Duncan.
00:00:30.155,00:00:33.116,"With Arthur gone, there'll be no one to protect her from her own reputation."
00:00:33.158,00:00:36.036,"A letter has arrived for you, madam, from the village."
00:00:36.077,00:00:38.079,"Geillis Duncan, ye're under arrest for witchcraft."
00:00:38.121,00:00:40.165,Under whose orders?
00:00:40.207,00:00:41.542,The other sorceress.
00:00:41.583,00:00:42.751,What on earth have I done?
00:00:42.793,00:00:44.336,You'll hear all about it at the trial.
00:02:30.150,00:02:31.151,Where the hell are we?
00:02:35.781,00:02:39.534,"You heard the warden, the thieves' hole."
00:02:42.454,00:02:45.082,Is there anyone else in here?
00:02:45.124,00:02:47.501,Earwigs.
00:02:48.543,00:02:51.130,Rats the size of lyam-hounds.
00:02:55.050,00:02:57.218,You only have yourself to blame for this.
00:02:57.260,00:03:00.014,Are you saying this my fault?
00:03:00.055,00:03:02.724,I'm the one that warned you to pack your belongings and flee.
00:03:02.766,00:03:05.644,Just as the wardens arrived at my door.
00:03:05.686,00:03:07.729,Perhaps it was you who sent them to me.
00:03:07.771,00:03:09.690,It was Laoghaire.
00:03:09.731,00:03:12.526,She arranged the letter to tell me to go to your house.
00:03:12.567,00:03:15.029,And she was there watching us as the wardens took us out.
00:03:15.070,00:03:18.323,"I kept your secrets, Claire."
00:03:23.411,00:03:30.878,"If you didn't want to add fuel to the rumors, then you shouldn't have made it common knowledge that you were under the full moon dancing naked and burning effigies."
00:03:32.046,00:03:33.588,So you think I'm a witch?
00:03:33.630,00:03:36.299,Of course not.
00:03:36.341,00:03:42.139,"You may not have killed Dougal's wife, but you definitely killed Arthur."
00:03:42.181,00:03:45.059,"And it wasn't witchcraft, it was old-fashioned poison."
00:03:47.227,00:03:48.311,Am I wrong?
00:04:10.751,00:04:14.337,I started with white arsenic a few months ago.
00:04:17.174,00:04:20.219,Thought it would kill Arthur off before the child began to show.
00:04:22.679,00:04:24.932,And then you'd be free to marry Dougal.
00:04:29.186,00:04:30.812,"It's a boy, again."
00:04:35.192,00:04:36.276,He's kicking.
00:04:38.361,00:04:39.613,WARDEN: Food for the witches.
00:04:42.657,00:04:43.700,Wait.
00:04:45.911,00:04:48.413,I need to talk to you.
00:04:50.290,00:04:51.374,Is that right?
00:04:51.416,00:04:53.418,"I'm Claire Fraser, from Castle Leoch."
00:04:53.460,00:04:56.671,"I'm married to James Fraser, nephew of the Laird."
00:04:56.713,00:04:58.506,And I'm King Arthur.
00:05:01.718,00:05:05.139,Surely King Arthur was more appealing than that slimy paddock.
00:05:17.234,00:05:18.986,We won't be here long.
00:05:24.032,00:05:25.784,Dougal will come for us.
00:05:25.826,00:05:26.910,"No, he won't."
00:05:26.952,00:05:28.369,"Yes, he will."
00:05:30.371,00:05:35.961,Jamie said that Dougal told Colum all about your affair and the baby.
00:05:36.003,00:05:40.882,"Colum banished him, sent him to his wife's funeral, and commanded that he stay away."
00:05:42.050,00:05:44.052,And sent Jamie with him.
00:05:45.470,00:05:47.973,"No one is coming, Geillis."
00:06:03.071,00:06:04.363,Share a bit of dinner?
00:06:06.491,00:06:07.701,I'm not hungry.
00:06:09.203,00:06:10.829,How long do they mean to keep us here?
00:06:12.247,00:06:14.541,"Till the trial, of course."
00:06:14.582,00:06:16.168,They'll summon the examiners.
00:06:29.931,00:06:32.934,Lie near me.
00:06:52.287,00:06:54.373,We're going to burn the witches.
00:06:54.413,00:06:56.583,We're going to burn the witches.
00:06:56.624,00:06:58.793,We're going to burn the witches.
00:06:58.835,00:06:59.794,It's starting.
00:07:03.422,00:07:07.302,I suppose getting burned as a witch is better than freezing to death.
00:07:08.095,00:07:09.346,WARDEN: Make way.
00:07:10.097,00:07:11.223,Rise up.
00:07:35.330,00:07:36.331,Move!
00:07:39.834,00:07:40.919,Make way!
00:07:46.466,00:07:48.135,BOY: They're coming!
00:07:52.722,00:07:54.682,Is that what I think it is?
00:07:54.724,00:07:56.101,"Well, it's not a maypole, Claire."
00:08:03.233,00:08:05.902,Make way for the accused.
00:08:17.872,00:08:41.604,"Stating in evidence that the accused, one Geillis Duncan and one Claire Fraser, both standing before the Church's court for the crime of witchcraft, did inflict pain, suffering and death upon the citizens of Cranesmuir by their practice of the unholy arts."
00:08:45.608,00:08:48.445,CLAIRE: There were no familiar faces in the crowd.
00:08:48.487,00:08:50.530,None of my friends from Castle Leoch.
00:08:51.656,00:08:56.536,My knowledge of witch trials told me that the accused rarely walked free.
00:08:59.039,00:09:00.332,NED: Make way.
00:09:07.422,00:09:09.174,"And you are, sir?"
00:09:09.216,00:09:11.551,"My name is Edward Gowan, Your Honor."
00:09:11.592,00:09:14.054,"Lawyer, former writer to the Signet, Edinburgh."
00:09:16.848,00:09:17.598,Let him pass.
00:09:23.230,00:09:26.358,"And what brings you here, sir?"
00:09:26.400,00:09:33.240,"Your Honors, as we're all aware, the Witchcraft Act of 1563 was repealed by the House of Lords in 1735."
00:09:33.281,00:09:36.993,I therefore submit that this entire trial is illegal.
00:09:44.167,00:09:49.047,"This is an ad hoc proceeding, under the administration of the Church."
00:09:49.089,00:09:58.598,"Well, I see that we have dispensed with British law, which pleases me greatly, but I am certain that you will not wish to dispense with our proud Scottish legal tradition."
00:09:58.639,00:10:00.600,"We are still in Scotland, are we not?"
00:10:01.976,00:10:04.771,"No one's disputing that, Mr. Gowan."
00:10:04.812,00:10:10.151,"Yes, well, here in Scotland, an accused witch is entitled to a defense lawyer at trial."
00:10:11.611,00:10:16.699,A benefit sadly not offered to those in merry old England.
00:10:18.118,00:10:22.789,As I therefore would like to offer my services in support of the accused.
00:10:23.873,00:10:25.625,"Oh, very well."
00:10:26.543,00:10:27.627,Take your place.
00:10:35.009,00:10:36.595,MAN: Jeanie Hume.
00:10:41.349,00:10:46.438,"I labored as housekeeper for Arthur and Geillis Duncan for nigh on five years, Your Honor."
00:10:46.480,00:10:54.237,And did you have occasion to witness any strange or unyirdlie goings-on during that tenure?
00:10:54.279,00:11:01.202,"I can tell ye that it was many the woman that come to the door seeking love charms, amulets, talismans and the like."
00:11:05.248,00:11:08.751,And did ye ever witness Mrs. Fraser in league with Mrs. Duncan?
00:11:10.086,00:11:12.046,Many times.
00:11:12.088,00:11:14.841,"In the fields, gathering herbs."
00:11:14.882,00:11:16.551,"And in the still room, meddling potions."
00:11:18.803,00:11:21.348,Poor Mr. Duncan knew naught of any of it.
00:11:26.060,00:11:29.730,"For the better part of an hour, she built a convincing case against us."
00:11:29.772,00:11:32.691,"It was dreadful what befell that dear, sweet man."
00:11:33.943,00:11:38.823,"On many occasion, I have heard Mrs. Duncan singing in the hall outside where Mr. Duncan was sleeping."
00:11:39.658,00:11:41.700,What kind of singing?
00:11:41.742,00:11:43.620,"Ominous incantations, to be sure."
00:11:44.996,00:11:47.666,It would send the kittlins running from the house.
00:11:47.706,00:11:49.501,"Animals have a nose for these things, ye ken."
00:11:50.793,00:11:52.504,They sense evil.
00:11:52.546,00:11:55.632,So now we're to take the testimony of a cat?
00:11:59.302,00:12:00.178,KILGORE: Mr. Gowan.
00:12:01.221,00:12:07.477,"Isn't it the truth, Mrs. Hume, that you were unhappy in your position at the Duncan's residence?"
00:12:07.519,00:12:09.020,I was quite content there.
00:12:09.062,00:12:16.277,"Oh, so content that you inquired about a position at Castle Leoch, seeing that you were underpaid and under-admired?"
00:12:16.319,00:12:27.746,"And where you referred to Mr. Duncan, and I quote, as a flatulent old scunner, and his wife to be a flibbertigibbet."
00:12:30.250,00:12:32.669,I don't recollect those were my exact words.
00:12:32.711,00:12:39.551,"What we have here, Your Honors, is nothing more than the grumblings of a malcontented maidservant."
00:12:42.053,00:12:43.471,Take a seat.
00:12:49.644,00:12:52.897,"MAN: Let us summon the next witness, Robena Donaldson."
00:13:03.032,00:13:12.667,"My man and I had an ailing child, born healthy, but it turned puny and weak."
00:13:14.669,00:13:16.296,We knew it was a fairy changeling.
00:13:30.893,00:13:32.729,But...
00:13:32.771,00:13:36.815,"But just before morn, we saw her."
00:13:43.323,00:13:57.920,"She took the child in her vile embrace, and spoke strange spells over it."
00:14:04.719,00:14:08.222,"When the sun rose, my good man and I went to see."
00:14:10.933,00:14:17.315,"And there we found the changeling child, dead on the hill..."
00:14:17.357,00:14:19.025,...and no sign of our own wee bairn.
00:14:21.319,00:14:23.697,"It was her who done the wicked deed, sirs."
00:14:24.489,00:14:25.906,I know it in my bones!
00:14:27.534,00:14:29.494,"I was on that hill that night, but I didn't harm your child!"
00:14:29.536,00:14:30.495,I was trying to help him!
00:14:30.537,00:14:31.996,So you admit it.
00:14:32.038,00:14:33.247,MAN: Witch!
00:14:33.289,00:14:34.582,I am a healer!
00:14:36.083,00:14:39.504,I am a healer!
00:14:39.546,00:14:42.173,I was trying to save it!
00:14:42.215,00:14:45.259,Do not further incriminate yourself.
00:14:45.301,00:14:47.554,You...
00:14:47.595,00:14:51.224,You have my deepest sympathy on the loss of yer beloved child.
00:14:52.767,00:15:02.402,"But may I ask, if ye were there, why did you not stop this woman from interfering with the work of the fairies?"
00:15:02.861,00:15:03.903,I...
00:15:04.945,00:15:05.905,I was afeared.
00:15:07.907,00:15:20.503,"So isn't it true, then, that your fear and silence allowed her to contaminate the bairn so that when the fairies came, they could not complete the switch?"
00:15:32.265,00:15:43.943,"At least ye can take comfort in knowing that it was the changeling child that died, and that your own child is healthy and living forever with the fairies."
00:15:50.658,00:15:55.705,"Perhaps we should thank this woman, instead of condemning her."
00:15:58.249,00:15:59.918,Witness dismissed.
00:16:05.715,00:16:18.853,"CLAIRE: Ned's skill at turning an argument on its head started to show promise, but as I looked around the room at these good people, I wondered what made them so ready to watch us burn."
00:16:18.895,00:16:23.023,"Regardless of the evidence, they only wanted one outcome."
00:16:23.065,00:16:26.653,"Call the next witness, Alastair Duffie."
00:16:28.446,00:16:32.700,Have ye a charge to put to either of the women here?
00:16:32.742,00:16:34.327,"Against Geillis Duncan, Your Honor."
00:16:35.662,00:16:40.500,"With my own eyes, I saw her standing on the battlements during a great storm."
00:16:40.541,00:16:43.294,I saw her call down the lightning with a flick of her hand.
00:16:44.378,00:16:46.547,Thunder roared as she laughed.
00:16:46.589,00:16:53.012,"Her eyes, red as flames, with a look in them that would steal the soul from a man."
00:16:53.805,00:17:02.563,"Then the wind rose up, her cloak flapped open around her and she leapt into the sky and flew like a great-winged bird!"
00:17:04.357,00:17:05.942,Aye! Aye!
00:17:11.364,00:17:12.406,Witch!
00:17:14.534,00:17:16.536,Please.
00:17:16.577,00:17:18.037,The accused will be silent.
00:17:29.507,00:17:30.717,Ned.
00:17:30.758,00:17:32.176,There's grave danger afoot.
00:17:32.218,00:17:33.803,What do you think of our prospects?
00:17:33.845,00:17:36.681,"After today, I wager we stand a chance."
00:17:36.723,00:17:38.265,Did Colum send you to help me?
00:17:38.307,00:17:43.103,"Oh, no. In fact, he would not look favorably upon me being here."
00:17:43.145,00:17:44.772,Did he have something to do with my arrest?
00:17:46.399,00:17:48.108,Ned?
00:17:48.150,00:17:50.695,"Here, take this usquebaugh, water of life."
00:17:50.737,00:17:52.071,It'll keep you warm tonight.
00:18:26.230,00:18:28.691,"He's a queer fellow, isn't he?"
00:18:31.193,00:18:32.862,"Well, he certainly seems optimistic."
00:18:34.572,00:18:36.574,"Ye still don't understand, do ye?"
00:18:37.658,00:18:39.118,They mean to kill us.
00:18:48.586,00:18:56.677,"Drink tonight, Claire, for tomorrow, our ashes will be scattered to the four winds."
00:19:01.641,00:19:03.101,I am curious.
00:19:04.811,00:19:09.107,"Was it Dougal you were after, or his position and money?"
00:19:12.068,00:19:14.070,"No, I had plenty of money."
00:19:15.613,00:19:18.491,I knew where Arthur kept the keys to his papers and notes.
00:19:20.284,00:19:21.995,'Twas easy enough to forge his signature.
00:19:23.329,00:19:28.501,"I managed to divert near on 1,000 pounds over the last two years."
00:19:29.710,00:19:30.878,You stole his money. Why?
00:19:33.506,00:19:34.966,For Scotland.
00:19:35.008,00:19:36.968,"What do you mean, for Scotland?"
00:19:37.010,00:19:42.140,"I dream of our Bonnie Prince Charlie, a Stuart king back on the throne."
00:19:43.474,00:19:45.059,You're a bloody Jacobite.
00:19:49.605,00:19:52.025,So it was politics that brought you and Dougal together.
00:19:54.777,00:19:59.032,He's the only man I ever met who could be my proper match.
00:20:00.908,00:20:05.329,You are aware that he's not exactly the most faithful man.
00:20:05.371,00:20:07.123,Do you think I mind?
00:20:07.165,00:20:08.582,He's got an eye for the lasses.
00:20:12.670,00:20:15.923,Colum fights for the MacKenzies.
00:20:15.965,00:20:21.261,"Dougal fights for the MacKinnons, the MacPhersons, the Chisholms, the Camerons."
00:20:21.303,00:20:22.930,The man's a lion.
00:20:23.430,00:20:24.390,God.
00:20:25.766,00:20:28.061,You actually love the bastard.
00:20:34.025,00:20:36.360,"Your words, not mine."
00:20:42.950,00:20:53.627,"So Colum ordered him to go, So sorry, Geillis."
00:20:55.629,00:20:57.090,Don't you dare.
00:20:57.131,00:21:00.718,"Come the rising, I shall know I helped."
00:21:00.760,00:21:04.805,"Whatever happens with the examiners, I would do it all again."
00:21:20.196,00:21:21.197,Nicely put.
00:21:22.322,00:21:24.283,Isn't it just?
00:21:32.959,00:21:34.210,How about you?
00:21:35.002,00:21:36.503,Do ye love him?
00:21:36.545,00:21:39.215,"Your ginger-haired laddie, Jamie?"
00:21:40.382,00:21:42.635,It's his name you cry out in your sleep.
00:22:39.566,00:22:41.944,"Aye. Same to you, my friend."
00:22:47.491,00:22:48.534,A starling.
00:22:52.663,00:22:55.124,You can always find them amongst the more common birds.
00:22:57.584,00:22:59.170,The plumage is iridescent.
00:22:59.212,00:23:00.838,Looks like a silly crow to me.
00:23:03.465,00:23:09.180,"When I was a little girl, I used to go to Brighton in November."
00:23:09.222,00:23:11.765,"They would all gather there, thousands of them."
00:23:12.850,00:23:14.185,This massive flock.
00:23:15.269,00:23:17.688,"A murmuration, it was called."
00:23:17.730,00:23:26.488,"They'd be swooping and twirling in this kind of hypnotic cloud, in perfectly synchronized patterns."
00:23:26.530,00:23:28.241,What possesses them to do such a thing?
00:23:30.284,00:23:32.703,To protect each other from the falcons.
00:23:34.163,00:23:35.622,Safety in numbers.
00:23:36.957,00:23:38.251,WARDEN: Hitch the wagon.
00:23:40.294,00:23:42.588,"We're hardly a flock, you and I."
00:23:42.629,00:23:43.923,WARDEN: Clear the path!
00:23:43.964,00:23:48.177,"Although, according to witnesses, I have been known to take wing."
00:23:49.387,00:23:50.428,Rise up.
00:23:52.056,00:23:53.099,Time to go.
00:24:06.404,00:24:07.445,Step aside.
00:24:15.037,00:24:16.330,Come on.
00:25:03.127,00:25:06.504,"KILGORE: From Castle Leoch, Laoghaire MacKenzie."
00:25:09.175,00:25:12.094,LAOGHAIRE: She was not Mrs. Fraser when we first became acquaint.
00:25:12.136,00:25:13.595,She was Mistress Beauchamp then.
00:25:14.930,00:25:15.889,WATT: Go on.
00:25:16.932,00:25:18.351,I came to her for a potion...
00:25:22.355,00:25:24.857,...to open Jamie Fraser's heart to my own.
00:25:30.988,00:25:35.159,"I'm sorry, it's painful to speak about..."
00:25:38.496,00:25:45.961,"I was the one, you see, who Jamie was meant to marry, but she took the potion herself."
00:25:47.421,00:25:48.922,I don't believe it.
00:25:50.174,00:25:52.968,Did you concoct such a potion?
00:25:55.346,00:25:58.307,It wasn't an actual potion.
00:26:00.684,00:26:02.311,She hexed Jamie and turned him away from me.
00:26:02.353,00:26:03.812,She stole him!
00:26:03.854,00:26:04.938,This is nonsense.
00:26:04.980,00:26:06.899,I didn't hex anybody.
00:26:06.940,00:26:09.985,"Clearly, she's a jealous young lass with a broken heart."
00:26:10.027,00:26:12.570,Aye. My heart was broken.
00:26:13.989,00:26:17.117,"And when I confronted her, she struck me."
00:26:19.119,00:26:21.205,Did you in fact strike this woman?
00:26:23.123,00:26:26.210,She put an ill-wish under my bed.
00:26:26.252,00:26:28.003,And then tried to seduce my husband!
00:26:29.422,00:26:31.424,He was the love of my life.
00:26:33.926,00:26:34.968,Burn the both of them!
00:26:35.593,00:26:36.594,Burn!
00:26:47.898,00:26:51.444,These crocodile tears are just further evidence that she's trying to get me out of the way...
00:26:51.485,00:26:54.572,"Cease your ramblings, Mrs. Fraser!"
00:26:54.612,00:26:56.532,You're an embarrassment to yourself.
00:27:00.327,00:27:02.455,Let's call the next witness.
00:27:02.496,00:27:04.790,"His Reverence, Father Bain."
00:27:15.801,00:27:26.853,"Ye good folk of Cranesmuir, I knew when I first set eyes on Claire Fraser that you had welcomed the whore of Babylon into your midst."
00:27:28.564,00:27:39.074,That you had allowed yourselves to be seduced from the path of righteousness by her beguiling sinfulness and wicked allurement!
00:27:39.116,00:27:41.452,Is this a trial or a sermon?
00:27:49.293,00:27:59.553,I fell to my knees and prayed for God to curse her malevolence and wreak his mighty vengeance upon her body and soul.
00:28:03.223,00:28:05.683,And God answered my prayers.
00:28:08.979,00:28:20.157,"He said to me, You have made a prodigious mistake."
00:28:23.160,00:28:31.210,"When young Tammas Baxter was seized by Beelzebub, I administered the last rites, I abandoned hope."
00:28:34.254,00:28:41.261,"Blinded by vanity, hubris, I rebuked Claire Fraser."
00:29:01.281,00:29:04.201,"Blessed congregation, hear my confession."
00:29:06.745,00:29:17.423,"I failed Tammas Baxter, I failed you and I failed God."
00:29:19.216,00:29:23.262,I'm no longer worthy to serve the good and holy people of this parish.
00:29:27.099,00:29:28.726,I beseech you.
00:29:30.436,00:29:31.645,Let me go.
00:29:45.825,00:29:48.370,Bear witness to her fiendish ploy.
00:29:48.412,00:29:51.331,It would take Satan himself to drive a man of God away!
00:30:01.174,00:30:02.134,Witch!
00:30:02.175,00:30:03.051,Burn her!
00:30:04.094,00:30:05.845,I have done nothing.
00:30:08.974,00:30:15.355,"Father, this court forbids you to leave this parish."
00:30:18.776,00:30:20.819,After heedful consideration...
00:30:20.860,00:30:23.322,"Your Honors, a momentary recess."
00:30:27.743,00:30:29.828,"Briefly, Mr. Gowan."
00:30:50.849,00:30:52.643,"NED: Please, allow these ladies some privacy, please."
00:30:52.685,00:30:54.227,I ask you quite thankfully...
00:30:54.269,00:30:55.312,Please.
00:30:59.566,00:31:02.861,"I'm afraid the climate has turned, and there is no coming back from it."
00:31:03.529,00:31:04.863,What do we do?
00:31:05.489,00:31:06.532,We save one of you.
00:31:09.409,00:31:11.203,Neither one of us is a witch.
00:31:12.412,00:31:14.623,It's what people think you are.
00:31:18.918,00:31:22.464,"And let's be frank, ye've practiced yer murky trade for years."
00:31:22.506,00:31:26.092,"The only thing that ever stood between you and a pile of kindling was your husband, and he's dead."
00:31:26.134,00:31:28.554,"Are you my lawyer or my judge, Mr. Gowan?"
00:31:28.595,00:31:32.725,"I've tried, Mrs. Duncan, but you're beyond saving, and you ken it."
00:31:32.766,00:31:34.309,"What is it you're saying, Ned?"
00:31:40.315,00:31:44.277,State that she tricked you and drew you into her evil web.
00:31:48.031,00:31:48.907,What if I don't?
00:31:50.450,00:31:51.869,They'll burn ye both.
00:31:59.376,00:32:03.505,"I'll give ye a moment to think about it, but hasten, because this court awaits."
00:32:04.381,00:32:05.924,Stay back! Stay back!
00:32:06.759,00:32:10.220,This is just too much.
00:32:10.262,00:32:12.180,"No, wait."
00:32:12.222,00:32:13.432,There has to be another way.
00:32:13.473,00:32:14.600,Why are you here?
00:32:15.809,00:32:17.770,What are you talking about?
00:32:17.811,00:32:18.937,I was arrested...
00:32:18.978,00:32:20.773,"No, why are you here in Scotland?"
00:32:20.814,00:32:22.691,I was traveling from Oxfordshire.
00:32:22.733,00:32:23.983,You've been lying all along.
00:32:24.025,00:32:25.944,Dougal knew it.
00:32:25.985,00:32:28.321,That's why he hasn't lifted a finger to help you.
00:32:28.363,00:32:30.031,You have no idea what you're talking about.
00:32:30.073,00:32:33.243,"No more lies, Claire!"
00:32:30.073,00:32:37.414,"If I'm going to die, if I'm going to burn as a witch, I need to know I'm dying for something."
00:32:37.456,00:32:40.459,"So tell me now, and this time I want the truth."
00:32:40.500,00:32:41.752,Why are you here?
00:32:42.878,00:32:44.588,They're growing impatient.
00:32:44.630,00:32:46.339,We need a moment.
00:32:46.381,00:32:47.424,A moment!
00:32:52.846,00:32:54.973,I'm not here for any reason.
00:32:57.058,00:32:58.310,I came and it was an accident.
00:32:58.351,00:32:59.352,By accident.
00:33:01.688,00:33:08.278,"So you don't want to change things or do anything at all, do you?"
00:33:09.321,00:33:10.948,I just want to go home.
00:33:12.282,00:33:14.576,I don't even know if that's possible.
00:33:22.709,00:33:23.961,"Geillis, I..."
00:33:24.002,00:33:26.672,I cannot delay the court any longer.
00:33:26.713,00:33:27.589,What are you going to do?
00:33:36.139,00:33:38.391,Looks like I'm going to a fucking barbecue.
00:33:46.274,00:33:50.988,"Uh, Your Honors, Mrs. Fraser would like to address the court."
00:34:28.274,00:34:29.860,Mr. Gowan is mistaken.
00:34:30.694,00:34:31.862,I have nothing to say.
00:34:34.406,00:34:35.574,Are you mad?
00:34:35.615,00:34:37.325,Maybe I am.
00:34:37.367,00:34:40.871,KILGORE: We must rely on an injunction of the Lord.
00:34:40.913,00:34:44.791,Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.
00:34:44.833,00:34:53.341,"Thereby, we pronounce Geillis Duncan and Claire Fraser guilty, and do hereby condemn them to death!"
00:34:53.383,00:34:56.135,Burn the witch!
00:34:56.177,00:34:57.095,Burn the witch!
00:34:58.513,00:34:59.556,Burn her!
00:35:01.558,00:35:04.102,"Conduct the prisoners to the pyre, if you please."
00:35:07.022,00:35:08.440,The question you had before.
00:35:11.860,00:35:13.737,I forbid this.
00:35:15.739,00:35:17.115,I think it is possible.
00:35:18.450,00:35:19.367,What?
00:35:20.326,00:35:21.160,No!
00:35:21.620,00:35:23.121,1968.
00:35:30.336,00:35:31.129,Ned!
00:35:33.381,00:35:35.341,Ned!
00:35:37.260,00:35:38.386,Condemn them!
00:35:38.428,00:35:40.680,You're all murderers!
00:35:40.722,00:35:43.141,Your God will damn you all.
00:35:43.182,00:35:45.310,You're going to burn in hell!
00:35:45.351,00:35:48.730,"You will not speak before this court in that manner, woman."
00:35:48.772,00:35:50.732,Strip her and skelp her!
00:35:50.774,00:35:54.069,"No! Get off of me, you bastards!"
00:35:54.111,00:35:57.155,"Get your bloody hands off me, you bloody bastard!"
00:35:59.825,00:36:01.827,I shall dance upon your ashes.
00:36:24.474,00:36:25.809,Harder!
00:36:25.851,00:36:26.893,Harder!
00:36:29.437,00:36:31.189,Claire! Let her go!
00:36:36.569,00:36:40.198,Sir. You have no place in the working of this court.
00:36:43.910,00:36:47.413,I swore an oath before the altar of God to protect this woman!
00:36:47.455,00:36:55.088,"And if you're telling me you consider your authority to be greater than that of the Almighty, then I must inform ye that I'm not of that opinion myself."
00:37:09.519,00:37:13.148,This woman is no witch.
00:37:14.024,00:37:15.483,But I am.
00:37:16.651,00:37:17.986,Geillis! No!
00:37:20.697,00:37:29.581,"I confess that I killed my husband, Arthur Duncan, by the means of witchcraft."
00:37:29.622,00:37:36.588,"I took advantage of the ignorance of Claire Fraser, bewitching her for my purposes."
00:37:36.629,00:37:44.262,"She neither took part in, nor had knowledge of my dealings, nor does she serve my master."
00:37:48.307,00:37:52.270,See here!
00:37:58.777,00:38:04.116,CLAIRE: What the villagers saw as evidence of evil was actually the scar of a smallpox vaccination.
00:38:05.533,00:38:08.494,And it hit me like a bolt of lightning.
00:38:08.536,00:38:12.290,"Geillis was from the future, from 1968."
00:38:15.501,00:38:16.795,Run!
00:38:16.836,00:38:18.046,"Claire, come now!"
00:38:18.088,00:38:21.258,I am the mistress of Satan.
00:38:22.592,00:38:24.302,I carry his child!
00:38:25.178,00:38:26.221,Burn her!
00:38:26.638,00:38:27.597,Geillis.
00:38:29.891,00:38:34.187,I have lain with Beelzebub in the darkest hours!
00:38:41.778,00:38:44.363,Silence!
00:38:47.284,00:38:50.369,Cover the witch!
00:38:50.411,00:38:55.250,I will have the child of Satan.
00:38:55.292,00:38:56.334,Cover her up!
00:38:59.129,00:39:02.090,Stop! She's with child!
00:39:17.105,00:39:19.941,I'm with child!
00:40:00.023,00:40:03.401,The cuts are not deep.
00:40:04.861,00:40:07.655,I think you'll not be marked.
00:40:13.452,00:40:17.249,"Claire, I know there are things ye do not wish to tell me."
00:40:18.833,00:40:20.501,But I have one thing to ask ye.
00:40:21.378,00:40:23.796,Honesty.
00:40:23.838,00:40:26.591,"When you do tell me something, let it be the truth."
00:40:26.632,00:40:28.260,And I'll promise you the same.
00:40:33.306,00:40:36.434,"Then there's one thing I must ask you, for your own safety as well as mine."
00:40:39.145,00:40:42.148,Are you a witch?
00:40:46.319,00:40:48.071,Are you serious?
00:40:48.113,00:40:52.075,I've often seen that scar on your arm and thought nothing of it.
00:40:52.117,00:40:54.411,Until I saw the same on Geillis Duncan today.
00:40:58.373,00:41:00.292,She called it the Devil's mark.
00:41:01.960,00:41:03.295,So...
00:41:09.008,00:41:10.593,I'm not a witch.
00:41:16.057,00:41:18.726,"After you hear the truth, then maybe you'll think otherwise."
00:41:27.026,00:41:30.071,I've never had smallpox.
00:41:30.113,00:41:33.532,But I can walk through a room of dying men and never catch it.
00:41:36.369,00:41:38.871,"I can nurse the sick, but their sickness cannot touch me."
00:41:42.000,00:41:44.502,This mark is called a vaccine.
00:41:45.837,00:41:48.256,And you've never heard of it.
00:41:50.258,00:41:52.844,But it prevents me from contracting the disease.
00:42:00.018,00:42:03.813,I know about Jack Randall because I was told about him.
00:42:06.065,00:42:13.739,"I know the day he was born, and I know the day he will die, and I know that he works for the Duke of Sandringham because my husband told me about it."
00:42:22.415,00:42:28.296,"I know about the Bonnie Prince, the Jacobites and their doomed cause."
00:42:43.478,00:42:45.563,I know all of this because...
00:42:53.988,00:42:56.032,I'm from the future.
00:43:00.745,00:43:05.208,I was born on October the 20th in the year 1918.
00:43:05.250,00:43:08.002,That's 200 years from now.
00:43:10.880,00:43:12.298,Do you hear me?
00:43:17.011,00:43:18.430,Do you hear me?
00:43:21.974,00:43:23.393,I hear you.
00:43:28.273,00:43:30.608,"You think I'm raving mad, don't you?"
00:43:34.737,00:43:35.613,No.
00:43:39.909,00:43:42.870,"No, I believe you, Sassenach."
00:43:52.004,00:43:57.009,"I dinna understand it a bit, not yet."
00:43:57.051,00:44:01.139,But I trust you.
00:44:03.057,00:44:06.269,And I trust there is a truth between us.
00:44:16.488,00:44:23.995,"And so, whatever ye tell me, I will believe you."
00:44:43.931,00:44:45.558,Can you tell me more?
00:44:56.777,00:45:00.948,I was a combat nurse in the British Army.
00:45:00.990,00:45:03.451,"Before we left the church, she said to me, 1968."
00:45:03.493,00:45:06.078,I told him everything.
00:45:12.835,00:45:16.422,Tell me again about the stones.
00:45:16.464,00:45:22.094,"CLAIRE: I didn't realize how badly I needed to tell someone, anyone, until that moment."
00:45:22.136,00:45:24.138,The Scots never had a chance.
00:45:24.180,00:45:25.264,He listened.
00:45:25.306,00:45:26.932,Thousands were killed at Culloden.
00:45:26.974,00:45:30.102,"He didn't understand it all, but he listened."
00:45:37.569,00:45:38.861,You were trying to get back.
00:45:40.321,00:45:41.738,Back to the stones.
00:45:42.407,00:45:46.827,And back to your husband.
00:45:48.996,00:45:50.456,Yes.
00:45:56.588,00:45:58.089,And I beat you for it.
00:46:04.429,00:46:08.266,"I'm so very, very sorry."
00:46:11.060,00:46:12.729,You couldn't have known.
00:46:24.907,00:46:26.492,Rest now.
00:46:28.994,00:46:30.288,No one will harm ye.
00:46:32.873,00:46:33.874,I'm here.
00:46:42.467,00:46:43.968,Do you really believe me?
00:46:52.727,00:46:54.811,"I believe you, Sassenach."
00:46:58.107,00:47:01.818,Although it would have been a good deal easier if you'd only been a witch.
00:47:23.466,00:47:26.260,"CLAIRE: Over the next several days, we rode hard."
00:47:26.302,00:47:34.644,"We were both determined to leave the castle and the trial far behind us, hopeful the distance would overshadow the questions that remained unanswered."
00:47:34.686,00:47:36.187,JAMIE: And from the main house...
00:47:36.228,00:47:43.902,"CLAIRE: Jamie spoke repeatedly of Lallybroch, detailing the life we'd have together, the life he'd always imagined."
00:47:45.279,00:47:47.490,I tried to listen.
00:47:47.532,00:47:50.409,I tried to invest in Lallybroch as my home.
00:47:51.703,00:47:58.710,"I tried to imagine a life for us both, but I felt adrift, anchorless in a running sea."
00:49:38.768,00:49:40.770,I want you inside me.
00:49:42.605,00:49:43.564,"No, mo nighean donn."
00:49:45.107,00:49:46.108,I want to watch you.
00:50:52.299,00:50:53.425,Yes.
00:51:06.605,00:51:07.899,Take a look.
00:51:43.267,00:51:44.810,It's what you wanted.
00:51:47.354,00:51:49.231,Aye?
00:51:49.273,00:51:50.983,What you've always wanted.
00:51:52.484,00:51:53.861,To go home.
00:51:59.909,00:52:01.077,Yes.
00:52:34.693,00:52:35.987,It's your place.
00:52:37.613,00:52:38.906,This is it.
00:52:47.205,00:52:48.164,Is this the one?
00:52:50.918,00:52:52.168,Yes.
00:53:11.605,00:53:13.565,I really didn't do anything.
00:53:17.277,00:53:23.159,"I heard this buzzing sound, and I just touched the stone."
00:53:24.660,00:53:26.202,Claire.
00:53:38.883,00:53:40.216,"I'm sorry, lass."
00:53:40.676,00:53:42.845,I stopped ye.
00:53:42.887,00:53:44.471,I shouldna have done so.
00:53:49.727,00:53:53.105,I just wasna ready.
00:53:57.526,00:53:58.944,I know.
00:54:06.284,00:54:08.244,"Well, there's no use in waiting."
00:54:09.705,00:54:10.873,I must part with ye now.
00:54:12.791,00:54:14.250,That's why we're here.
00:54:18.214,00:54:22.467,It's your own time on the other side of that stone.
00:54:22.509,00:54:25.554,"You've a home there, a place."
00:54:26.722,00:54:28.264,The things you're used to.
00:54:30.684,00:54:31.894,And Frank.
00:54:34.312,00:54:35.355,Frank.
00:54:39.359,00:54:41.570,There's nothing for you on this side.
00:54:43.030,00:54:46.075,"Nothing, save violence and danger."
00:54:47.743,00:54:48.994,Now go.
00:54:55.375,00:55:03.801,I'll stay at the camp until nightfall to make sure that you're safe.
00:55:09.056,00:55:10.766,"Goodbye, Sassenach."
00:55:14.519,00:55:15.311,Jamie!
00:57:12.304,00:57:13.597,"CLAIRE: On your feet, soldier."
00:57:24.400,00:57:26.277,Take me home to Lallybroch.
00:00:01.293,00:00:02.377,CLAIRE: Previously...
00:00:02.419,00:00:04.797,Yer ring.
00:00:04.839,00:00:06.757,So ye'd know the place was as much yours as mine.
00:00:06.799,00:00:10.385,"JAMIE: It was one day in October, Captain Randall came along to our place."
00:00:10.427,00:00:11.553,"Now, let my sister be."
00:00:11.595,00:00:12.680,Your sister?
00:00:13.639,00:00:15.474,No!
00:00:15.516,00:00:17.100,The Duke of Sandringham has arrived.
00:00:17.142,00:00:21.188,I look forward to helping your husband to restore his good name.
00:00:21.229,00:00:24.232,JAMIE: This is my first real opportunity to gain a pardon.
00:00:24.274,00:00:26.944,Take my rightful place as Laird of Broch Tuarach.
00:00:26.986,00:00:31.281,I was born on October the 20th in the year 1918.
00:00:33.450,00:00:35.452,I'm from the future.
00:00:35.494,00:00:37.705,It's what you wanted.
00:00:42.334,00:00:43.919,Take me home to Lallybroch.
00:02:49.461,00:02:52.965,Airplane wings are stationary.
00:02:53.007,00:02:54.800,They don't flap.
00:02:54.842,00:02:56.802,And you've ridden in one.
00:02:56.844,00:02:59.096,"Yes, several times."
00:02:59.638,00:03:00.681,I love flying.
00:03:02.016,00:03:03.892,JAMIE: How high can ye fly?
00:03:03.934,00:03:05.811,"CLAIRE: Well, I don't know exactly."
00:03:05.853,00:03:08.105,"Thousands of feet in the air, certainly."
00:03:08.147,00:03:11.650,What? Thousands of feet?
00:03:14.695,00:03:16.530,It's amazing.
00:03:16.571,00:03:18.866,Especially the first time you go up.
00:03:18.907,00:03:23.662,"I mean, everything you can see on the ground, it just falls away, until it disappears."
00:03:26.040,00:03:27.833,"Hold old are you, Sassenach?"
00:03:27.875,00:03:29.710,I never thought to ask.
00:03:29.751,00:03:32.838,I'm 27.
00:03:32.880,00:03:35.215,I always thought you were about my age or younger.
00:03:37.009,00:03:38.677,Are you disappointed?
00:03:46.894,00:03:49.229,I think your calculations are a little off.
00:03:52.649,00:03:53.483,There it is.
00:03:54.442,00:03:55.652,Lallybroch.
00:04:13.503,00:04:15.255,It's like you always said it was.
00:04:16.131,00:04:17.216,Aye.
00:04:25.265,00:04:26.266,Come.
00:04:27.726,00:04:29.103,Come.
00:04:40.655,00:04:43.075,"CLAIRE: It's behind you now, Jamie."
00:04:43.117,00:04:44.284,It's in the past.
00:04:48.288,00:04:55.754,Dougal told me afterward that Randall had got Jenny with a bastard child.
00:04:59.716,00:05:00.717,It's rumors.
00:05:04.138,00:05:05.264,Aye.
00:05:49.224,00:05:51.018,RANDALL: You care to see more?
00:05:51.059,00:05:53.770,Or would you rather go into the house and offer me better entertainment?
00:05:54.395,00:05:55.396,CLAIRE: Hello.
00:06:03.030,00:06:04.405,Are you playing with the apples?
00:06:07.075,00:06:08.493,What's your name?
00:06:13.040,00:06:14.249,Jenny.
00:06:27.971,00:06:29.388,Four years and no word?
00:06:34.186,00:06:36.813,"This is your uncle, mo chridhe, the one you're named after."
00:06:42.319,00:06:43.820,Why would you name him after me?
00:06:48.992,00:06:57.876,"Do you not think I've suffered enough for what I let happen that ye must name Randall's bastard after me, to be a reproach as long as I live?"
00:06:58.710,00:07:01.338,Randall's bastard?
00:07:08.595,00:07:10.389,"Go find Mrs. Crook, my wee lamb."
00:07:17.478,00:07:24.319,"Correct me, brother, if I'm wrong, but I have a strong impression you're saying that I played the whore to Captain Randall?"
00:07:30.992,00:07:32.911,And whose is this one?
00:07:32.953,00:07:35.289,"To have you ruin yourself for me was shame enough, but..."
00:07:36.748,00:07:39.793,Another one with no father to give him a name?
00:07:39.834,00:07:41.336,We shouldn't have come.
00:07:41.378,00:07:42.629,"Jamie, perhaps we should all go inside..."
00:07:45.840,00:07:48.176,She's my wife and you'll speak of her with respect.
00:07:48.218,00:07:49.594,"Jamie, please."
00:07:51.179,00:07:53.556,Do I have to do what I did when we were bairns?
00:07:56.143,00:07:58.186,Are you now trying to shame me in front of my own wife?
00:07:58.228,00:08:01.481,"Well, if she's your wife, I imagine she's more familiar with your balls than I am."
00:08:03.400,00:08:04.985,"Don't test me, brother."
00:08:09.990,00:08:19.374,"Last I saw you, bloodied and broken, strung up by yer wrists in that archway and then leaving me to think ye're dead or certain never to return again."
00:08:20.834,00:08:22.336,Whose child is the boy?
00:08:22.377,00:08:23.378,Mine.
00:08:26.423,00:08:27.632,"And that one, too."
00:08:28.342,00:08:29.509,Ian?
00:08:30.551,00:08:32.387,Your brother-in-law.
00:08:35.432,00:08:37.851,"IAN: It's good to see ye, Jamie."
00:08:37.892,00:08:39.644,Ye always knew how to make an entrance.
00:08:41.188,00:08:44.565,We thought you were dead until we received your chest from Castle Leoch.
00:08:59.789,00:09:01.833,And this would be...
00:09:01.875,00:09:03.835,The trollop.
00:09:03.877,00:09:05.462,Otherwise known as Claire Fraser.
00:09:11.385,00:09:14.471,"Jenny, I'm..."
00:09:11.385,00:09:16.473,"A damned fool, and not a day wiser in four years."
00:09:31.196,00:09:32.697,IAN: Ye drink whiskey?
00:09:32.739,00:09:34.115,CLAIRE: I've been known to have a glass or two.
00:09:35.742,00:09:38.912,"Today, I'm thinking we'll be taking more than that, Claire."
00:09:53.468,00:09:55.303,What happened with Randall?
00:09:56.137,00:09:57.305,I want to know.
00:09:57.347,00:09:59.349,I need to know.
00:10:06.981,00:10:08.358,Then I'll tell ye.
00:10:08.942,00:10:10.360,Once.
00:10:10.402,00:10:11.694,And never again.
00:10:16.157,00:10:17.200,Uhh!
00:10:23.790,00:10:25.166,After he felled you...
00:10:39.097,00:10:40.265,Take my hand.
00:10:41.099,00:10:42.642,Take my hand.
00:10:47.314,00:10:48.482,JENNY: I went with him into the house.
00:10:52.193,00:10:53.570,He took me up the stairs.
00:10:54.571,00:10:55.905,He was talking the whole way up.
00:10:55.947,00:10:58.325,I didn't hear a word he said.
00:10:58.366,00:11:00.994,My mind was racing with what to do.
00:11:01.035,00:11:02.662,I was just trying to keep my wits.
00:11:06.166,00:11:08.209,He led me into the bedroom.
00:11:47.957,00:11:48.791,Shh.
00:12:12.607,00:12:13.650,Um.
00:12:20.114,00:12:21.074,Look at me.
00:12:39.300,00:12:40.343,Ugh!
00:13:10.081,00:13:13.918,"I hadn't been with a man then, but I ken now that he was trying to..."
00:13:15.336,00:13:16.795,Make himself ready.
00:13:46.200,00:13:47.285,Turn around.
00:14:05.428,00:14:07.388,I don't know why.
00:14:11.768,00:14:17.524,"But he didn't like it when I laughed and I could see that, so I laughed some more."
00:14:37.836,00:14:40.046,"I said turn around, you Scottish cunt."
00:14:51.015,00:14:52.892,"JENNY: When I woke up, he was gone."
00:14:54.394,00:14:57.021,And that's the last I saw of Captain Randall.
00:15:10.535,00:15:11.952,Ye satisfied?
00:15:14.414,00:15:17.667,"Ye see, you were wrong and I'm expecting an apology."
00:15:17.709,00:15:18.835,"Well, have I not said as much?"
00:15:18.877,00:15:20.879,"No, you haven't."
00:15:20.920,00:15:22.672,She's right.
00:15:26.885,00:15:29.011,This is between my brother and me.
00:15:30.096,00:15:31.264,I was just suggesting that he...
00:15:31.305,00:15:33.140,Can I see you in private for a moment?
00:15:35.518,00:15:36.770,Excuse us.
00:15:54.995,00:15:56.581,I'm your husband.
00:15:56.623,00:16:00.418,You mustn't embarrass me in front of my family and the servants.
00:16:00.460,00:16:02.879,You're doing a fine enough job of that yourself.
00:16:02.921,00:16:04.839,"And you've a sharp tongue, Claire."
00:16:06.132,00:16:08.050,But there's a time and a place for it.
00:16:08.092,00:16:09.761,And I suppose you'll be the judge of that?
00:16:09.803,00:16:11.679,I need you to trust me here.
00:16:11.721,00:16:14.265,"This is my family, my land..."
00:16:20.271,00:16:23.942,I'm Laird.
00:16:23.983,00:16:25.860,We should both conduct ourselves as such.
00:16:25.902,00:16:28.655,I'm not the meek and obedient type.
00:16:28.696,00:16:31.282,"I don't think anyone would ever make that mistake, Sassenach."
00:16:33.033,00:16:37.455,"But then, I don't think anyone would ever say the same of Colum's wife, either."
00:16:37.497,00:16:39.039,Letitia?
00:16:39.833,00:16:42.001,Strong woman. Respected.
00:16:42.836,00:16:44.587,Feared even.
00:16:44.629,00:16:47.047,But she never crossed her husband's word in public.
00:16:48.466,00:16:50.217,"Now, behind closed doors..."
00:16:51.218,00:16:54.973,"Well, let's just say my uncle dodged his share of crockery in his time."
00:16:59.101,00:17:00.603,"Be careful, My Laird."
00:17:00.645,00:17:03.147,I have a much better throwing arm than the fair Letitia.
00:17:31.050,00:17:33.344,"So, whereabouts are ye from, Claire?"
00:17:34.428,00:17:36.014,"Oxfordshire, originally."
00:17:37.598,00:17:40.351,But I suppose this is now my home.
00:17:43.855,00:17:45.481,"Ye're planning on staying, then?"
00:17:46.983,00:17:48.067,Aye.
00:17:49.986,00:17:51.404,"Aye, we are."
00:17:52.697,00:17:54.365,What about the price on yer head?
00:17:57.702,00:18:02.331,I'm expecting a pardon with the aid of the Duke of Sandringham.
00:18:02.373,00:18:05.501,"It hasn't come through yet, but we're hoping it will soon."
00:18:16.470,00:18:18.765,Perhaps I could trouble you for some warm water to wash?
00:18:21.141,00:18:22.435,Been a difficult few days.
00:18:26.188,00:18:28.900,And you mentioned a chest from Leoch?
00:18:30.359,00:18:33.362,It came from a woman called Mrs. Fitzgibbons.
00:18:33.404,00:18:35.364,It's upstairs in the spare room.
00:18:38.826,00:18:41.454,Move our things to the north room.
00:18:41.495,00:18:43.247,"No, I wouldn't dream of putting you out of your room."
00:18:43.957,00:18:45.374,Well...
00:18:45.416,00:18:49.587,"Seeing as it's the Laird's room, after all, I'll get the keys."
00:19:09.857,00:19:11.109,You missed the whirlwind.
00:19:14.612,00:19:16.030,The what?
00:19:18.491,00:19:19.909,The servants.
00:19:22.036,00:19:26.499,"I'd barely turned my back, and they'd cleared away all of Jenny and Ian's things."
00:19:32.088,00:19:34.423,It's almost exactly how I remember it.
00:19:38.678,00:19:45.893,My father always had a book over there open at the page he was reading.
00:19:45.935,00:19:46.978,Hmm.
00:19:53.818,00:19:54.819,Hmm.
00:20:01.909,00:20:03.786,Ah...
00:20:06.747,00:20:07.874,His blade.
00:20:13.838,00:20:14.755,"It's Viking, I think."
00:20:15.882,00:20:18.425,Aye. Five-lobed pommel.
00:20:19.677,00:20:20.761,Tenth century.
00:20:25.432,00:20:27.226,I recognize the patterns on the hilt.
00:20:29.103,00:20:31.189,It's a fine example.
00:20:37.028,00:20:43.492,"I'd hardly tiptoe in here as a boy, so sacred was the Laird's room."
00:20:45.036,00:20:51.876,But I'd slip in when he was out at the fields just to hold it for a few moments.
00:20:51.918,00:20:54.170,Dream of the day it would be mine.
00:20:56.172,00:20:58.174,"It is yours now, Jamie."
00:21:02.929,00:21:04.304,Ours.
00:21:08.101,00:21:09.268,Ours.
00:21:13.940,00:21:17.985,"And my father, he built this place, ye ken."
00:21:23.199,00:21:26.119,His blood and sweat are in this stone.
00:21:27.536,00:21:28.704,This land.
00:21:32.166,00:21:34.293,And now his bones are as well.
00:21:36.295,00:21:41.425,"They buried him out in the graveyard next to my mother and my brother, Willie."
00:21:45.179,00:21:46.764,When was the last time you saw your father?
00:21:52.394,00:21:56.315,"It was at Fort William, a week after I'd been flogged the first time."
00:22:01.320,00:22:03.864,Jamie.
00:22:03.906,00:22:05.574,Having a word with Captain Randall.
00:22:05.616,00:22:06.951,Trying to see if we can get ye out.
00:22:06.993,00:22:09.162,I'm sorry for the whole damn mess.
00:22:09.203,00:22:10.579,"You left me in charge, and now Jenny's..."
00:22:13.958,00:22:15.668,I know you were flogged.
00:22:15.709,00:22:17.461,I'll be all right.
00:22:17.503,00:22:18.671,No.
00:22:18.712,00:22:19.922,This is my son.
00:22:19.964,00:22:21.215,Have ye no compassion?
00:22:22.883,00:22:24.426,Remember to pray.
00:22:24.468,00:22:27.221,"And I'll stand by ye, no matter what happens."
00:22:31.809,00:22:32.977,"Ye're a braw lad, son."
00:22:50.036,00:22:51.453,He's worried about you.
00:22:53.122,00:23:02.048,I'm afraid he was disappointed when I told him your charges are of such a serious nature that you cannot be bonded without a written clearance from the Duke of Argyll.
00:23:09.763,00:23:10.931,The thing is...
00:23:23.861,00:23:25.154,So...
00:23:37.291,00:23:40.044,It's a shame that you and I have got off to such a poor start.
00:23:46.384,00:23:51.389,"Only a week before, he'd had me flogged near to death."
00:23:53.140,00:23:57.061,"Didn't understand, I couldna imagine what he was talking about now."
00:23:59.021,00:24:01.690,And he bandied words around for a while.
00:24:03.109,00:24:05.152,He likes to do that.
00:24:06.695,00:24:09.365,Likes to play with his toys.
00:24:13.077,00:24:16.122,"But in the end, he was quite blunt about what he really wanted."
00:24:16.956,00:24:18.124,Which was what?
00:24:21.710,00:24:22.878,Me.
00:24:29.218,00:24:40.813,"Give over to me, make free of your body, and there will be no second flogging."
00:24:54.243,00:24:55.828,Well...
00:25:18.434,00:25:21.561,The first stripes were still raw on my back.
00:25:22.813,00:25:31.197,I could scarce bear my shirt and I felt dizzy every time I stood up.
00:25:33.991,00:25:35.201,The thought of...
00:25:36.369,00:25:38.536,Of going through it all again...
00:25:39.246,00:25:46.253,"Being bound, helpless, waiting for the next lash..."
00:25:52.510,00:25:55.637,"I had no real idea, of course, but..."
00:25:55.679,00:25:59.225,I thought being buggered would be less painful.
00:25:59.266,00:26:01.559,"And be over quicker, most likely."
00:26:02.811,00:26:06.606,"And he said I'd be set free the same day, so..."
00:26:09.360,00:26:10.403,So...
00:26:12.029,00:26:13.822,I considered it.
00:26:27.169,00:26:28.295,But...
00:26:30.588,00:26:33.717,I could still feel my father's kiss on my cheek.
00:26:35.844,00:26:39.265,And thought what he would think of me...
00:26:39.306,00:26:42.726,"Not the buggery, he'd not give that a thought or care, but..."
00:26:44.103,00:26:45.603,For giving in.
00:26:47.273,00:26:49.567,For letting that man break me.
00:26:53.320,00:26:55.072,"So, I couldn't do it."
00:27:05.541,00:27:07.167,"Dougal was there, at the flogging."
00:27:09.169,00:27:12.339,"My father, too, though I didn't know it at the time."
00:27:28.105,00:27:29.689,He thought I was dead.
00:27:32.818,00:27:37.864,"Dougal said he let out a small sound, and dropped liked a rock."
00:27:40.117,00:27:41.494,And didn't get up again.
00:27:45.331,00:27:47.333,I didn't see it.
00:27:49.209,00:27:51.003,Didn't see him die.
00:27:52.712,00:27:53.755,Didn't see him taken away.
00:27:57.009,00:27:58.427,Didn't see him buried.
00:28:03.557,00:28:05.976,Never even seen his grave.
00:28:08.686,00:28:12.525,"Even if you had given in to Randall, do you really think it would have made any difference?"
00:28:13.984,00:28:19.990,And don't you think he would have still had you dragged out into that yard and flogged you just for the sick pleasure it gave him?
00:28:23.076,00:28:24.828,I'll never know.
00:28:26.497,00:28:29.041,JENNY: How long does it take a person to dress?
00:28:29.082,00:28:30.834,Supper's not going to keep.
00:28:35.964,00:28:37.550,We should get cleaned up.
00:29:03.367,00:29:04.993,Have you ever run a house before?
00:29:06.953,00:29:08.080,No.
00:29:09.164,00:29:11.458,IAN: Very good.
00:29:11.500,00:29:14.503,Then ye'll have a lot to learn about keeping up a place like this.
00:29:16.796,00:29:19.383,I would imagine.
00:29:19.425,00:29:22.010,But I'm a quick study.
00:29:22.052,00:29:25.764,Ye'll get your chance.
00:29:25.805,00:29:29.309,What is that?
00:29:29.351,00:29:32.020,"It's, like, when we collected the rents for the MacKenzies."
00:29:34.314,00:29:36.734,"And sorely needed, this quarter."
00:29:36.775,00:29:38.944,We've had poor harvests two years running.
00:29:38.985,00:29:40.696,We're piling debt upon debt.
00:29:40.738,00:29:44.032,"Ah, we can talk about finances later."
00:29:44.074,00:29:46.702,Tomorrow will be a time for celebrating the Laird's return.
00:29:48.412,00:29:50.247,Sounds very public.
00:29:52.082,00:29:54.418,At least until your pardon comes through?
00:29:54.460,00:29:56.795,No.
00:29:56.836,00:30:01.216,"Not a man, woman or child would think about betraying Jamie to the Redcoats."
00:30:01.258,00:30:02.760,At any price.
00:30:07.139,00:30:10.976,I'll take a look at the ledgers after we've eaten.
00:30:11.017,00:30:13.019,Thought you'd want to visit Father's grave.
00:30:15.063,00:30:15.897,Aye.
00:30:16.356,00:30:18.567,Tomorrow.
00:30:18.609,00:30:20.944,"If he were alive, he'd expect a visit this evening."
00:30:23.781,00:30:27.826,"If he were alive, he'd expect me to go over the ledgers and prepare for quarter day."
00:30:33.373,00:30:34.374,Suit yerself then.
00:30:39.546,00:30:40.839,"Stuffed cabbage, Claire?"
00:30:41.548,00:30:42.966,"No, thank you."
00:30:57.063,00:30:58.898,"We're right pleased to have ye back, my Laird."
00:31:01.901,00:31:04.279,"As do we, Robert."
00:31:04.321,00:31:06.406,"I brought this small gift for you, milady."
00:31:06.448,00:31:07.825,"How lovely, thank you."
00:31:09.409,00:31:10.619,It looks delicious.
00:31:12.871,00:31:13.872,"WOMAN: I brought these for you, milady."
00:31:14.790,00:31:16.667,Thank you so much.
00:31:16.709,00:31:17.876,They're beautiful.
00:31:21.380,00:31:22.881,How are ye?
00:31:25.843,00:31:26.885,IAN: Jamie?
00:31:27.969,00:31:28.887,Should we get started?
00:31:30.556,00:31:31.557,Aye.
00:31:33.475,00:31:35.310,Hello.
00:31:49.449,00:31:50.784,I think it's a boy.
00:31:55.955,00:31:57.583,Make yourself at home.
00:31:57.624,00:31:59.042,Good to see ye.
00:32:03.088,00:32:05.131,"WOMAN: So, you think it's a boy?"
00:32:10.178,00:32:11.930,Duncan.
00:32:11.971,00:32:13.891,Married now?
00:32:15.141,00:32:18.478,"Duncan, this is but half of what ye owe."
00:32:20.814,00:32:24.192,"Apologies, but we lost one of our cows to sickness two months ago."
00:32:26.194,00:32:30.365,"Well, ye can settle up next quarter, when I'm certain things will be better."
00:32:31.617,00:32:33.577,I appreciate yer understanding and mercy.
00:32:36.663,00:32:40.959,"Yer father was a good man, farmed this land when I was but a bairn."
00:32:43.336,00:32:44.087,Give me that.
00:32:47.507,00:32:50.803,I'll not squeeze the last penny from you when times are hard.
00:32:50.844,00:32:53.138,"That was my father's view, mine as well."
00:32:54.807,00:32:55.891,"Thank ye, My Laird."
00:32:56.683,00:32:57.726,Thank ye kindly.
00:32:59.561,00:33:01.146,"All right, who's next?"
00:33:11.657,00:33:13.617,It's so pretty.
00:33:13.659,00:33:16.119,The lavender's great.
00:33:16.161,00:33:18.497,"You put it on your wrists at night, like this."
00:33:21.917,00:33:22.960,"Cheers, boys."
00:33:26.129,00:33:27.923,Ugh!
00:33:27.965,00:33:30.008,"You put that back, you cheeky wee bastard!"
00:33:33.470,00:33:34.930,Excuse me.
00:33:36.849,00:33:38.767,I don't believe we've met.
00:33:38.809,00:33:41.144,Claire Fraser.
00:33:41.186,00:33:43.146,I ken fine who ye are.
00:33:43.188,00:33:45.858,I told ye there'd be none for you.
00:33:51.279,00:33:52.781,They said he'd gone and married a Sassenach.
00:33:53.532,00:33:55.408,That's correct.
00:33:55.450,00:33:56.576,Can I be of some assistance?
00:33:58.077,00:34:00.831,Boy's just got to learn to do what he's told.
00:34:00.873,00:34:03.333,Maybe I can take him off your hands for a few minutes.
00:34:03.375,00:34:04.626,What for?
00:34:07.629,00:34:08.797,Join your friends.
00:34:13.927,00:34:16.179,Just don't be filling his head with any of that English claptrap.
00:34:18.765,00:34:20.475,"And you, behave."
00:34:27.566,00:34:28.316,It's all right.
00:34:30.151,00:34:32.278,Maybe we should go into the kitchen.
00:34:32.320,00:34:34.072,"Find you something to eat, okay?"
00:34:39.870,00:34:41.079,Ooh.
00:34:43.081,00:34:46.626,We can find you something tastier than bannocks.
00:34:46.668,00:34:47.419,"What have we here, then?"
00:34:52.257,00:34:53.174,Jenny...
00:34:57.012,00:34:58.430,His father was being very rough with him.
00:34:59.806,00:35:01.433,Is your back sore?
00:35:10.191,00:35:12.151,We should get him cleaned up and something tasty to eat.
00:35:13.528,00:35:14.821,Who did that?
00:35:16.489,00:35:18.116,Mrs. Crook will get you a wee bite.
00:35:20.243,00:35:22.120,It was his father.
00:35:22.829,00:35:24.081,MacNab?
00:35:25.164,00:35:27.084,I remember him.
00:35:27.125,00:35:28.919,"M'Laird, will ye take a drink with me?"
00:35:28.961,00:35:30.378,Aye.
00:35:31.463,00:35:32.380,Jamie?
00:35:41.723,00:35:44.684,"MAN: Goodnight, My Laird."
00:36:16.382,00:36:18.510,I've seen elephants sit down with less impact.
00:36:31.481,00:36:32.649,Sassenach.
00:36:33.942,00:36:36.194,"Now ye're a Scot, ye should work on yer Gaelic."
00:36:37.821,00:36:39.280,Where have you been?
00:36:39.906,00:36:42.408,Out with MacNab.
00:36:44.577,00:36:51.168,"I tried to reason with him, but in the end, I had to show him the difference between abuse and discipline."
00:36:51.209,00:36:53.170,With these.
00:36:51.209,00:37:01.511,"Then I said to him, Ronald, if I ever see any evidence of you harming your wee laddie, you'll have to answer to Laird Broch Tuarach."
00:37:02.721,00:37:04.389,That's me.
00:37:04.430,00:37:05.891,"Yes, I know."
00:37:10.269,00:37:11.437,"Jamie, you reek."
00:37:13.899,00:37:15.650,You've actually seen an elephant?
00:37:17.110,00:37:18.195,Yes.
00:37:18.695,00:37:19.779,"Rode one, too."
00:37:24.409,00:37:27.162,Ye'll have to tell me all about it.
00:38:06.367,00:38:07.285,Mmm.
00:38:20.048,00:38:21.800,I think I may need the whole hound.
00:38:25.887,00:38:28.807,Ian tells me ye didna collect the rents yesterday.
00:38:31.768,00:38:35.396,"It's been a hard year, as ye said yerself."
00:38:35.438,00:38:39.109,"As Laird, I decided to give my tenants some ease."
00:38:39.151,00:38:44.906,And how easy do ye suppose yer tenants will be when the whole estate goes under because we canna make ends meet?
00:38:44.948,00:38:46.866,Perhaps we should postpone this until he's feeling a little...
00:38:46.908,00:38:48.910,And ye've saddled us with another mouth to feed.
00:38:50.411,00:38:53.498,Rabbie MacNab's father threw him out thanks to you.
00:38:53.539,00:38:57.502,"He said if Jamie Fraser thinks he can be a better father, he can damn well pay for his upkeep."
00:38:59.254,00:39:02.882,Clean clothes and bannocks aren't going to stop the boy from being beaten.
00:39:03.925,00:39:08.221,Do you think life just started when the two of you walked through that door?
00:39:08.263,00:39:11.975,Rabbie's granny and I were working on Ronald's sister to take the boy.
00:39:17.730,00:39:19.398,Do ye think that's how Father would've handled things?
00:39:20.859,00:39:22.610,I am the Laird of this estate now.
00:39:22.652,00:39:25.488,And I do not need to discuss the running of it with my sister.
00:39:29.450,00:39:33.205,"Begging yer pardon, Laird Broch Tuarach."
00:39:51.306,00:39:52.515,Mrs. Crook.
00:39:55.852,00:39:56.728,"Yes, My Laird?"
00:39:59.022,00:40:03.276,This bread tastes like it was made with pebbles.
00:40:03.318,00:40:05.945,The mill's not working properly.
00:40:05.987,00:40:07.864,We had to grind the flour by hand.
00:40:07.906,00:40:09.324,What's being done about it?
00:40:09.366,00:40:15.872,"The Mistress, or Mrs. Murray, had me send for Davy McAndrews to fix the mill."
00:40:17.123,00:40:18.291,I'll deal with it myself.
00:40:45.735,00:40:48.154,It'd be a damn sight better if the wheel were turning.
00:40:50.448,00:40:51.991,There must be something stuck under the sluice.
00:40:53.326,00:40:56.871,"I'm gonna have to go down, see if I can pry it loose."
00:40:59.624,00:41:01.918,"But, Jamie..."
00:41:03.336,00:41:04.670,You'll freeze to death.
00:41:06.298,00:41:08.925,Most likely.
00:41:08.967,00:41:11.469,At least ye'll be able to serve decent bannocks at my wake.
00:41:14.180,00:41:16.599,Oh! Cack!
00:41:16.641,00:41:19.436,Mrs. Crook told me the stupid fool had come up here.
00:41:19.477,00:41:22.647,"Jenny, you shouldn't be chasing around in your condition."
00:41:22.688,00:41:24.857,There was no need for you to come after us.
00:41:24.899,00:41:25.817,"Aye, there was."
00:41:38.955,00:41:40.498,Keep silent. We don't want them to know you're English.
00:41:53.928,00:41:56.348,"Good morrow, ladies."
00:41:56.389,00:41:58.808,"If ye're stopping for a bag of meal, I'm afraid ye'll be disappointed."
00:41:58.850,00:42:01.269,The mill wheel's not working just now.
00:42:01.311,00:42:03.146,Perhaps next time ye come this way?
00:42:03.813,00:42:04.647,Well...
00:42:06.191,00:42:07.442,"What's amiss, then?"
00:42:11.196,00:42:12.447,Ye should call yer master back.
00:42:12.489,00:42:14.407,He shouldna meddle in things he doesna understand.
00:42:16.659,00:42:18.036,The Corporal's father has a wheat mill in Hampshire.
00:42:20.330,00:42:23.500,What he doesn't know about waterwheels would fit in a shoe.
00:42:31.341,00:42:33.468,I'll have to go under and see what's holding it.
00:42:48.858,00:42:49.984,Look at that.
00:42:51.069,00:42:52.487,I wonder what was stuck in it.
00:42:52.529,00:42:53.612,Hey.
00:42:56.699,00:42:58.743,A perfectly good shirt.
00:42:58.784,00:43:03.706,How on the earth did that get stuck into the mill?
00:43:06.543,00:43:08.545,"It's Scotland, sir."
00:43:12.090,00:43:14.092,Ladies.
00:43:14.675,00:43:15.593,Hiyah!
00:43:31.317,00:43:32.610,"Blessed Michael, defend us!"
00:43:33.778,00:43:36.197,What the hell were you doing?
00:43:36.239,00:43:37.365,Have you not grown up a bit?
00:43:38.991,00:43:42.454,"Jenny, will ye please turn around while I try to get out?"
00:43:42.495,00:43:44.247,Before my cock snaps off.
00:43:56.593,00:43:57.843,What the hell was she doing here?
00:44:01.180,00:44:02.932,She was just trying to warn you.
00:44:30.751,00:44:32.211,"IAN: So you're a night owl, are ye?"
00:44:37.383,00:44:41.679,"Jenny's up with the lark, but I've always been an owl myself."
00:44:42.805,00:44:44.390,Is this Jenny?
00:44:44.432,00:44:47.644,Aye. Those were her birds.
00:44:47.685,00:44:52.689,"Any time one was found with a lame leg or a broken wing, she'd have it healed and eating from her hand."
00:44:54.733,00:44:56.693,Surprised she has a gentle side?
00:44:58.029,00:44:59.447,"No, of course not."
00:45:02.908,00:45:04.701,Perhaps a little.
00:45:04.743,00:45:06.329,She's a Fraser.
00:45:06.371,00:45:10.333,Their hearts are as big and soft as their heads are thick and strong.
00:45:11.708,00:45:16.713,It was Jenny who took care of me after I returned from France with a stump of wood.
00:45:18.049,00:45:21.511,Jamie told me you lost it while the both of you were fighting in France.
00:45:21.553,00:45:23.971,It doesn't slow me down much.
00:45:24.013,00:45:26.723,It aches a wee bit towards the end of the day.
00:45:27.975,00:45:30.978,Have you tried guelder rose or water pepper?
00:45:32.729,00:45:34.815,"I've not tried the water pepper, no."
00:45:34.857,00:45:36.484,"Well, I'd be happy to make some for you."
00:45:37.193,00:45:38.653,Thank you.
00:45:43.533,00:45:45.493,You've seen mangled men before?
00:45:47.078,00:45:49.664,"Yes, many, unfortunately."
00:45:50.289,00:45:51.499,Jamie hadn't.
00:45:52.749,00:45:55.044,It shocked him to see me like this at first.
00:45:55.086,00:45:57.463,"He tried to hide it, but I knew."
00:45:58.797,00:45:59.840,No matter.
00:45:59.882,00:46:01.676,He brought me back to Scotland.
00:46:01.718,00:46:03.636,And Jenny made me whole again.
00:46:04.929,00:46:06.305,Is that why you married her?
00:46:07.515,00:46:09.267,Ye think I had any choice in the matter?
00:46:17.650,00:46:23.448,"I was covered with muck, and her, standing there like a bush covered with butterflies."
00:46:23.489,00:46:28.953,"She says, well, I dinna ken exactly what she said, but..."
00:46:28.994,00:46:35.834,"It ended with her kissing me, and saying, Fine, we'll be married on St. Martin's Day."
00:46:35.876,00:46:43.926,"And I was still explaining to her why we couldna do any such thing when I found myself in front of a priest saying, I take thee, Janet."
00:46:54.145,00:46:56.063,Frasers.
00:46:56.105,00:47:02.945,"Once they've dug their heels in, there's no budging them, and ye don't want to get between them when their danders are up."
00:47:02.987,00:47:04.821,How do you manage?
00:47:02.987,00:47:09.661,"Well, ye can tug on their rope or give them a wee kick in their backside."
00:47:09.702,00:47:12.955,"And they might move, or ye might get bit for yer trouble."
00:47:14.749,00:47:15.750,And then what?
00:47:17.794,00:47:18.919,Kick them harder.
00:47:37.814,00:47:40.274,Good. Now I have your attention.
00:47:40.316,00:47:42.151,And you're going to listen to me.
00:47:42.193,00:47:44.612,I did not marry the Laird of Lallybroch.
00:47:44.654,00:47:47.948,"I married Jamie, but I haven't seen much of him since we walked through the gates of this place."
00:47:47.990,00:47:49.784,"That's who I am, now that..."
00:47:47.990,00:47:50.993,"I am speaking, and you can talk when I'm finished."
00:47:54.038,00:47:56.207,"Your father's dead, Jamie."
00:47:56.248,00:48:00.545,"But if he were here, I wager he'd give you a thrashing for the way you've been acting."
00:48:00.586,00:48:02.755,You're trying to be someone you're not.
00:48:02.797,00:48:07.009,"And in the process, you're wrecking the family that you do have left."
00:48:07.051,00:48:09.387,"And if you're not careful, you're going to lose them, too."
00:48:50.219,00:48:51.220,Jenny.
00:48:53.055,00:48:55.641,You gave me a start.
00:48:55.683,00:48:57.769,"Thought it was a ghost for a minute, did ye?"
00:49:01.021,00:49:02.064,"Jamie, I..."
00:49:08.738,00:49:10.656,"Let me speak first, please."
00:49:20.082,00:49:21.958,That's the rent from the tenants.
00:49:23.960,00:49:27.590,"And I thought perhaps I could speak to Rabbie's aunt, so..."
00:49:36.849,00:49:38.684,This is a better place for him.
00:49:39.936,00:49:41.687,"Father would have thought so, too."
00:49:46.066,00:49:46.983,Aye.
00:49:53.407,00:49:56.285,"I was wrong not to consult ye, and I'm sorry for it."
00:49:57.244,00:49:58.412,Truly.
00:49:59.996,00:50:01.415,I hope to do it different in future.
00:50:01.457,00:50:03.626,I'm the one who's wronged you and I'm so ashamed.
00:50:06.337,00:50:07.755,Of what?
00:50:10.174,00:50:18.014,"Ever since Father died, a small, dark part of me has blamed you for his death."
00:50:20.016,00:50:30.903,"When they told me what happened at Fort William, that Randall flogged ye himself and that seeing that is what killed Father, I thought ye must have done something to bring it upon yerself."
00:50:30.945,00:50:35.658,"Shot yer mouth off or acted without thinking of the consequences, as ye have done all yer life."
00:50:37.535,00:50:50.255,"But then out at the mill pond, when I saw the scars on yer back, scars made by a lash laid down with such fury..."
00:50:50.297,00:50:51.507,Dinna fash yerself about it anymore.
00:50:53.049,00:50:55.678,It was me. It's my fault that Randall beat you so.
00:50:55.720,00:50:57.053,You dinna ken what you're saying.
00:50:59.223,00:51:11.151,"That day... That day when Randall came here, when he took me upstairs, if I hadn't mocked him that way, if I'd given him what he wanted, he wouldn't have treated you like he did."
00:51:11.193,00:51:13.404,And then Father...
00:51:14.363,00:51:15.406,Don't.
00:51:20.661,00:51:30.086,"I did anger Randall at Fort William, and I've spent the past four years of my life blaming myself for Father's death because of it."
00:51:32.256,00:51:34.090,But now ye know better?
00:51:42.058,00:51:43.726,I know it's not yer fault.
00:51:44.727,00:51:47.354,Nor mine either.
00:51:47.396,00:51:50.649,There's a devil in that man that no one can influence.
00:51:52.860,00:51:58.991,The only one responsible for putting Father in his grave is Jack Randall.
00:52:01.326,00:52:02.244,Aye?
00:52:06.290,00:52:14.130,"It does trouble me, though, knowing ye went with him to save me, knowing he might harm ye."
00:52:16.174,00:52:18.594,I would have gladly died to spare you.
00:52:20.471,00:52:27.103,"And if yer life is a suitable exchange for my honor, tell me why my honor is not a suitable exchange for yer life."
00:52:27.143,00:52:29.229,Or are ye telling me that I may not love ye as much as you love me?
00:52:29.271,00:52:31.983,"Because if ye are, Jamie Fraser, I'll tell you right now it's not true."
00:52:33.400,00:52:34.276,No.
00:52:42.493,00:52:46.789,"Welcome home, Laird Broch Tuarach."
00:52:55.213,00:52:56.172,Come.
00:53:13.691,00:53:17.193,You said Broch Tuarach means north-facing tower.
00:53:18.403,00:53:19.446,Aye.
00:53:20.865,00:53:22.992,"Well, it's round, it doesn't have a face."
00:53:25.828,00:53:27.121,The door faces north.
00:53:32.543,00:53:33.794,Frasers.
00:53:37.631,00:53:39.466,I'm beginning to feel like...
00:53:43.554,00:53:44.513,Like I...
00:53:45.764,00:53:47.683,Like I actually belong here.
00:53:51.520,00:54:00.236,"I knew ye belonged here, with me, almost since the first time I laid eyes on ye."
00:54:01.530,00:54:03.699,That's one of the reasons I agreed to marry you.
00:54:03.741,00:54:05.910,Though not the main one.
00:54:10.915,00:54:14.585,Because I wanted you more than I ever wanted anything in my life.
00:54:17.046,00:54:23.094,Right from that moment I fell off the horse and woke up in the dark looking up at your face.
00:54:35.647,00:54:41.195,"That's why you agreed to marry me, because of my round arse and my rock-solid head?"
00:54:41.237,00:54:42.278,Mm.
00:54:43.405,00:54:45.157,I wanted ye from the first moment I saw ye.
00:54:45.199,00:54:46.408,But...
00:54:47.659,00:54:52.748,I loved ye when ye wept in my arms that first night at Leoch.
00:54:53.999,00:54:56.252,But now I...
00:54:56.292,00:55:02.216,"I wake up every day, and I find that I love you more than I did the day before."
00:55:11.892,00:55:13.936,I love you.
00:56:04.987,00:56:06.613,"MAN: Keep calm now, lad."
00:56:06.655,00:56:08.907,With what right did you come to this house without...
00:56:08.949,00:56:11.118,I've heard enough from the likes of you.
00:56:12.828,00:56:16.290,"Now you stay silent as a lamb, my friend..."
00:00:02.294,00:00:05.005,"I find you to be the most singular woman, Claire."
00:00:05.046,00:00:06.465,I'm Jamie's wife.
00:00:06.507,00:00:10.302,CLAIRE: Word filtered out that the Laird of Lallybroch had returned with his new bride.
00:00:10.344,00:00:12.179,"They're criminals, out to line their own pockets."
00:00:12.220,00:00:14.014,The money we pay is for protection.
00:00:14.055,00:00:16.433,The British don't take kindly to those who harbor outlaws.
00:00:18.727,00:00:19.770,Why'd you kill him?
00:00:19.812,00:00:21.396,He threatened me.
00:00:21.438,00:00:22.982,I never liked the Irish bastard.
00:00:23.022,00:00:24.023,Looks like this laddie's on his way.
00:00:24.065,00:00:25.192,Bloody hell.
00:00:25.233,00:00:26.568,Now I'm a man short.
00:00:26.610,00:00:29.989,"I could use a tall, strong Scotsman who's swift with a sword."
00:00:30.030,00:00:31.824,"CLAIRE: Haste ye back, or else."
00:00:33.074,00:00:34.576,Congratulations.
00:00:34.618,00:00:36.537,Some gave these to my mother.
00:00:36.578,00:00:39.707,My father used to tease her about her admirer.
00:00:40.624,00:00:42.167,Get back!
00:00:42.209,00:00:43.836,Where is Jamie?
00:00:43.878,00:00:45.004,The Redcoats have him.
00:02:22.935,00:02:24.185,"MRS. CROOK: Yes, ma'am?"
00:02:24.227,00:02:25.479,You need to start milking the goat straight away.
00:02:25.520,00:02:26.605,"Yes, ma'am."
00:02:26.647,00:02:28.398,And then ask Granny MacNabb for some honey.
00:02:28.440,00:02:29.316,She'll ken what it's for.
00:02:38.951,00:02:40.201,Claire? Claire!
00:02:40.995,00:02:42.121,What do you intend to do?
00:02:42.162,00:02:44.289,I intend to get my husband back.
00:02:44.331,00:02:46.458,"Well, you cannot go alone."
00:02:47.918,00:02:50.754,Allow me a moment to gather my strength and I'll accompany you.
00:02:50.796,00:02:52.756,You can't go anywhere in your condition.
00:02:54.675,00:02:55.592,You're missing your leg.
00:02:57.970,00:02:59.346,I'll fashion another one.
00:03:03.851,00:03:05.560,Mrs. Crook?
00:03:05.602,00:03:08.689,Fetch Duncan and have him gather the tenants.
00:03:08.730,00:03:09.773,The ones with proper weapons.
00:03:09.815,00:03:12.233,Right away.
00:03:14.528,00:03:15.988,We have to do something.
00:03:17.823,00:03:23.829,"If you engage with the British army to rescue Jamie, then Lallybroch could face retribution from the Crown."
00:03:23.871,00:03:26.247,And your Laird would not want that to happen.
00:03:26.289,00:03:28.207,Especially on his account.
00:03:28.249,00:03:30.251,"Well, at least let me make myself useful."
00:03:31.753,00:03:32.921,Give you a place to start.
00:03:32.963,00:03:35.298,Fetch me a paper and ink.
00:03:35.340,00:03:38.218,I'll try my hand at a rough map of where we were set upon.
00:03:47.144,00:03:48.228,"CLAIRE: Please, hurry."
00:03:57.863,00:03:59.698,Where on earth do you think you're going?
00:03:59.740,00:04:01.408,You just gave birth.
00:04:01.449,00:04:04.327,You may be armed with a map and a fair knowledge of the area.
00:04:07.455,00:04:08.707,CLAIRE: She was right.
00:04:08.749,00:04:11.793,I scarcely knew the terrain around Lallybroch.
00:04:11.835,00:04:15.547,"I could live for a time off the land, but for how long?"
00:04:15.589,00:04:20.969,"I knew full well if I had any hope of finding Jamie I'd need help, if not divine intervention."
00:04:21.511,00:04:22.470,Claire?
00:04:22.512,00:04:23.388,Yah!
00:04:26.141,00:04:27.184,Yah!
00:05:03.971,00:05:05.305,We're very close.
00:05:32.373,00:05:33.333,Get off!
00:05:37.212,00:05:38.880,"God, our father."
00:05:38.922,00:05:43.551,"Your power brings us to birth to guide our lives and by your command, we return to dust. Amen."
00:05:48.223,00:05:55.605,"God, our father, your power brings us to birth, your providence guides our lives and by your command we return to dust. Amen."
00:05:56.064,00:05:57.107,Amen.
00:06:06.365,00:06:09.786,CLAIRE: I was reminded of the sad timelessness of war.
00:06:09.828,00:06:13.081,Victors carry their dead from fields and bury them.
00:06:17.418,00:06:19.629,I found more tracks. East.
00:06:19.671,00:06:21.340,Just as Ian said.
00:06:21.380,00:06:22.632,It should be easy enough to follow.
00:06:25.635,00:06:28.429,"Hopefully, 'cause there's a rather large redheaded Scot weighing it down."
00:07:01.504,00:07:02.421,I'm bursting.
00:07:34.037,00:07:36.164,I'd no idea it flowed liked that.
00:07:36.206,00:07:38.875,"Aye, the bairn's sucking starts the milk."
00:07:38.917,00:07:40.294,Then all the child need do is swallow.
00:07:41.836,00:07:44.423,Ah! Feels much better.
00:07:44.464,00:07:45.632,I cannot leave wee Maggie too long.
00:07:47.759,00:07:48.843,It's a nuisance.
00:07:48.885,00:07:51.054,"Everything to do with bairns is a nuisance, almost."
00:07:51.888,00:07:54.891,"But still, I'd never choose not to have them."
00:07:58.270,00:07:59.479,"No, you wouldn't choose that."
00:08:07.321,00:08:08.488,Do you think we'll find him?
00:08:08.529,00:08:10.073,We have to.
00:08:12.617,00:08:16.621,"They get to Fort William before we do, I'm afraid Jack Randall might finally finish what he started."
00:08:17.831,00:08:20.000,I've been thinking about that.
00:08:23.837,00:08:28.342,He's the commander of the British Army in this area and Randall's superior.
00:08:28.383,00:08:30.010,"With any luck, he'll be there."
00:08:30.051,00:08:31.386,Why would he bargain with you?
00:08:33.138,00:08:35.640,I believe he took a shine to me when I met him at Brockton.
00:08:35.682,00:08:40.520,"And from what I observed, he holds Randall in absolute contempt."
00:08:40.561,00:08:42.772,Sounds more like a prayer than a plan.
00:08:42.814,00:08:44.441,"Well, it's better than no plan at all."
00:09:27.984,00:09:28.818,MAN: Come on!
00:09:38.495,00:09:39.746,Get your horses ready.
00:09:42.499,00:09:43.583,"SOLDIER: Aye, aye, sir."
00:09:47.087,00:09:47.837,There's Mr. MacQuarrie.
00:09:51.174,00:09:53.176,Where's Jamie?
00:09:54.219,00:09:55.970,JENNY: Soldiers are at ease.
00:09:56.012,00:09:56.971,No on guard.
00:09:58.557,00:09:59.891,Do you suppose they've killed him?
00:10:03.895,00:10:05.230,Because he's a headstrong Fraser.
00:10:13.530,00:10:15.656,"MAN: Private, take this dispatch straight away."
00:10:29.129,00:10:30.046,CLAIRE: Where's he going?
00:10:30.088,00:10:31.339,I don't know.
00:10:31.381,00:10:32.673,But there's one way to find out for sure.
00:10:59.284,00:11:00.785,"You all right, madam?"
00:11:00.827,00:11:01.869,I almost trampled you.
00:11:13.881,00:11:15.716,I'll not let harlots talk to me that way.
00:11:15.758,00:11:17.844,Untie me straight away.
00:11:17.885,00:11:19.596,"A harlot am I, now?"
00:11:19.638,00:11:21.889,Only a slut would stoop to rob a King's man.
00:11:23.016,00:11:25.268,We are not harlots or thieves.
00:11:25.310,00:11:26.894,We just want to know where the Highlander is.
00:11:27.562,00:11:29.189,The redheaded one.
00:11:29.230,00:11:30.982,"Go to the devil, the both of you."
00:11:32.859,00:11:34.735,You don't have to make this more difficult.
00:11:34.777,00:11:36.695,A simple answer and we'll be on our way.
00:11:41.784,00:11:44.078,I don't think you grasp the situation you're in.
00:11:44.120,00:11:46.373,I won't be able to stop her once she sets her mind to something.
00:11:46.414,00:11:50.210,An assault on a King's man is an assault on the Crown itself.
00:11:50.251,00:11:51.085,The other prisoner?
00:11:51.836,00:11:52.711,"Oh, no."
00:11:56.216,00:11:57.008,"SOLDIER: No, no, no."
00:11:57.884,00:11:59.093,"No, no, no!"
00:11:59.969,00:12:01.012,No!
00:12:01.054,00:12:02.138,"Oh, God!"
00:12:04.516,00:12:05.517,Where is he?
00:12:13.316,00:12:15.235,The Highlander?
00:12:15.276,00:12:16.944,It's the only tongue the English understand.
00:12:23.993,00:12:25.828,I beseech you.
00:12:25.870,00:12:28.623,Just tell us what you know and this will end.
00:12:28.665,00:12:30.749,"Maybe if I smoke your bollocks, you'll change your mind."
00:12:31.668,00:12:33.294,Hold! Hold!
00:12:33.336,00:12:35.338,Please.
00:12:35.380,00:12:36.839,I'm just a courier.
00:12:36.881,00:12:38.675,"Lord God, please hold."
00:12:40.176,00:12:41.595,"I'm a courier, please!"
00:12:42.303,00:12:47.225,"If he's a courier, maybe one of the dispatches will say something about Jamie."
00:12:48.851,00:12:49.977,I've found something.
00:12:57.776,00:13:00.071,...you'll both hang.
00:13:00.113,00:13:03.032,CLAIRE: It says they were taking him to the sheriff's court in Beauly but he escaped.
00:13:04.867,00:13:06.453,The army is still searching for him.
00:13:06.494,00:13:07.328,"Well, nobody's searching."
00:13:08.747,00:13:13.000,Those few soldiers back in the glen were taking MacQuarrie to the sheriff's court in Beauly.
00:13:13.042,00:13:16.463,This dispatch is calling on the garrison at Fort William to find Jamie.
00:13:17.589,00:13:19.215,And if they never read it...
00:13:22.719,00:13:25.096,He won't go back to Lallybroch.
00:13:25.138,00:13:26.139,That's the first place they'll look.
00:13:29.726,00:13:30.769,"No, he'll go north."
00:13:32.520,00:13:34.689,Deeper into the Highlands.
00:13:34.731,00:13:38.109,The garrison won't dare stray that far from supplies and reinforcements.
00:13:38.151,00:13:38.901,Too chancy.
00:13:48.202,00:13:50.288,What are you doing?
00:13:50.330,00:13:52.039,I'm going to stop the burning and bandage his foot.
00:14:01.758,00:14:03.677,He knows we're looking for Jamie.
00:14:03.718,00:14:07.639,How long do you think it'd be before they turn up in Lallybroch if we left him alive to blab?
00:14:12.811,00:14:15.689,"I ken you're my brother's wife, but I won't be judged by you, Claire."
00:14:17.357,00:14:19.192,I can see in your eyes you don't agree with my methods.
00:14:19.233,00:14:20.694,Just because I don't want to see the man murdered?
00:14:20.735,00:14:24.030,"No, because it bothers you and there's no room for sentiment like that here."
00:14:49.347,00:14:50.807,He won't be telling his tale to anyone.
00:14:56.187,00:14:59.023,"Next time, hide your tracks better."
00:15:00.900,00:15:01.901,I followed till I heard the screams.
00:15:10.034,00:15:10.910,Make camp.
00:15:12.412,00:15:13.538,I'll go find us some supper.
00:15:42.734,00:15:44.652,Love forces a person to choose.
00:15:47.363,00:15:49.449,You do things you never imagined you could do before.
00:16:00.167,00:16:01.085,I wasn't judging you.
00:16:07.634,00:16:10.010,I just know that if Murtagh hadn't turned up when he did...
00:16:14.766,00:16:15.975,I would have done it myself.
00:16:43.670,00:16:44.879,Should keep us warm till morning.
00:16:46.923,00:16:52.553,"For a lady from Oxfordshire, you ken your way about the wilds."
00:16:52.595,00:16:55.014,"When I was young, my uncle taught me how to survive outdoors."
00:16:56.390,00:16:58.685,We had to take whatever the land offered.
00:16:58.726,00:17:00.186,I picked up a few useful tips.
00:17:01.354,00:17:02.313,"Aye, I'd say so."
00:17:08.277,00:17:09.821,Where did you learn to track like that?
00:17:11.197,00:17:13.199,Jamie and Ian taught me when we were young.
00:17:15.075,00:17:16.410,They didn't mind you tagging along?
00:17:17.954,00:17:21.958,"Well, they knew if they refused, I'd either skelp their lugs or bedevil their suppers."
00:17:23.292,00:17:24.460,Bedevil their suppers?
00:17:33.427,00:17:34.637,Added a bit of seasoning.
00:17:36.931,00:17:41.811,I'd show them the wee beasties and tell them they'd get plenty more when they least expected it if they didn't teach me.
00:17:52.655,00:17:54.949,"So, Ian sent you, I expect?"
00:17:54.991,00:17:56.659,"Aye, he thought you could use the help."
00:18:05.125,00:18:06.085,Supper.
00:18:33.071,00:18:34.321,The rents from quarter day.
00:18:37.075,00:18:38.117,You'll take it and none of your nonsense.
00:18:40.244,00:18:43.372,This belongs to Ian.
00:18:43.414,00:18:44.164,He has another one.
00:18:46.751,00:18:48.086,Put it in the top of your stocking.
00:18:48.127,00:18:50.088,Hold it with your garter.
00:18:50.129,00:18:52.131,"Never take it off, even when you sleep."
00:18:55.009,00:18:55.802,Do you ken how to use a knife?
00:18:59.430,00:19:00.765,Yes. I do.
00:19:08.856,00:19:14.487,"CLAIRE: It was clear that with Murtagh's arrival, Jenny had to go back to Lallybroch and her infant daughter."
00:19:14.528,00:19:18.407,"However, I felt the burden of being a prophet."
00:19:21.702,00:19:22.578,Plant potatoes.
00:19:24.413,00:19:25.748,Potatoes?
00:19:25.790,00:19:26.791,They're no grown in the Highlands.
00:19:27.667,00:19:28.459,They will be.
00:19:30.628,00:19:33.089,The crop will keep for a long time and the yield is better than wheat.
00:19:36.425,00:19:37.217,Aye.
00:19:41.764,00:19:44.058,"There's none closer than Edinburgh, but I can send for them."
00:19:45.476,00:19:46.226,As many as you can.
00:19:48.354,00:19:51.607,There will be a famine.
00:19:51.649,00:19:54.527,"Any land or property you have that's not productive, sell it now for gold."
00:19:55.903,00:19:59.281,"A war is coming, slaughter."
00:19:59.323,00:20:01.117,Men will be hunted throughout the Highlands.
00:20:07.165,00:20:09.834,Didn't make much sense at the time.
00:20:09.876,00:20:11.794,"But he said if you did, I was to do as you ask."
00:20:16.590,00:20:18.217,Those are the important things to do for now.
00:20:27.476,00:20:28.268,"God go with you, Claire."
00:20:30.396,00:20:33.816,I can leave knowing you're gonna do whatever it takes to bring my brother back.
00:21:02.178,00:21:03.221,Are we headed north?
00:21:04.513,00:21:05.514,Aye.
00:21:06.515,00:21:07.558,Can you be more specific?
00:21:09.560,00:21:11.270,"North, then west."
00:21:12.605,00:21:13.981,You're a wealth of information.
00:21:15.066,00:21:17.068,Is there a place he might go?
00:21:17.110,00:21:18.111,There's no telling.
00:21:20.071,00:21:25.659,"But the traveling will not be easy for him, lying hid during the day and staying off the roads."
00:21:27.995,00:21:30.998,Then how exactly are we supposed to find him?
00:21:32.792,00:21:33.793,We're not.
00:21:37.004,00:21:37.964,The Laird's gonna find us.
00:21:39.132,00:21:40.758,What do you mean?
00:21:40.800,00:21:42.051,I've brought the rest of your medicines.
00:21:45.471,00:21:48.390,You need to establish a reputation around these parts as a healer.
00:21:49.600,00:21:50.893,You need to attract attention.
00:22:06.700,00:22:09.745,CLAIRE: I found out soon enough what he meant.
00:22:09.787,00:22:16.752,"We traveled openly and slowly, along the main roads and stopped at every croft, village and hamlet we came to."
00:22:19.964,00:22:28.514,"There, Murtagh would make a quick survey of the local populace, round up anyone suffering from illness or injury and bring them to me for treatment."
00:22:34.352,00:22:39.650,"Physicians, being few and far between in these parts, were always guaranteed to draw attention."
00:22:43.321,00:22:44.780,Get off!
00:22:44.822,00:22:45.781,MAN: Get off!
00:22:45.823,00:22:46.824,Get off!
00:22:50.036,00:22:52.370,CLAIRE: Murtagh had his own way of attracting attention.
00:22:59.170,00:23:01.255,MAN: You're like a sow in heat up there.
00:23:02.965,00:23:04.842,Off!
00:23:04.884,00:23:07.303,MAN: You're making me want to spend time with the wife!
00:23:07.345,00:23:09.305,CLAIRE: These lines are contradictory.
00:23:12.099,00:23:16.394,That means you're going on a journey and...
00:23:17.980,00:23:20.149,It's crossed by a broken line.
00:23:21.234,00:23:22.943,Which means you're staying put.
00:23:25.487,00:23:31.869,"There are strangers who've come into your life recently, many of them."
00:23:31.911,00:23:39.168,"And if I read this right, and I do, one of them is a very tall, strapping, red-haired man."
00:23:40.878,00:23:42.796,Have you seen someone like that recently?
00:23:46.717,00:23:48.010,No.
00:23:48.052,00:23:49.469,Only man I've seen of late is my husband.
00:23:50.512,00:23:53.140,"And he's short, fat and lazy."
00:23:53.182,00:24:00.522,"But this red-haired, strapping man you speak of, is he the one that's to take me on a journey?"
00:24:03.109,00:24:04.568,Possibly.
00:24:04.610,00:24:05.443,MAN: Sit down!
00:24:10.490,00:24:11.533,Are you sure?
00:24:12.285,00:24:14.036,Think.
00:24:16.496,00:24:17.706,"If I'd seen him, Lassie..."
00:24:19.833,00:24:21.335,...would I be sitting here talking to you?
00:24:25.089,00:24:26.506,"Well, I suppose not."
00:24:32.221,00:24:34.223,You have a very long and happy life to look forward to.
00:24:40.146,00:24:41.230,But your husband doesn't.
00:24:43.481,00:24:44.482,Oh!
00:24:45.901,00:24:46.944,Thank you.
00:24:56.829,00:24:57.746,Dimwits.
00:24:59.248,00:25:02.542,They wouldn't appreciate a fine performance if it bit them on their backsides!
00:25:07.631,00:25:09.507,So I'm to blame because you're not a success?
00:25:09.549,00:25:11.509,You were a distraction.
00:25:11.551,00:25:14.721,I couldn't concentrate on my steps for worrying about you.
00:25:14.763,00:25:16.349,It was your idea that I tell fortunes.
00:25:16.390,00:25:17.850,I'm just going along with the plan.
00:25:17.891,00:25:22.688,"Trust me, Jamie will come to us."
00:25:22.729,00:25:27.443,Very few fortune-telling healers roam the Highlands with a dancing Fraser clansman in tow.
00:25:27.485,00:25:29.445,Is there no other way for us to get the word out?
00:25:29.487,00:25:31.113,Words cannot travel by air.
00:25:31.155,00:25:32.530,"Not yet, anyway."
00:25:33.199,00:25:34.908,Huh?
00:25:34.950,00:25:37.786,Never mind.
00:25:37.828,00:25:38.578,Did you have any luck?
00:25:39.913,00:25:40.956,No.
00:25:42.249,00:25:44.502,This isn't going to work.
00:25:44.542,00:25:46.128,Not with that attitude it won't.
00:26:17.535,00:26:19.036,May I make a suggestion?
00:26:19.078,00:26:22.206,Perhaps you could sing a song to jazz up the dance a bit.
00:26:23.623,00:26:24.582,Jazz?
00:26:27.127,00:26:29.505,"To spice up, enliven."
00:26:30.256,00:26:31.673,A song?
00:26:31.715,00:26:33.591,"Yes. Something toe-tapping, like..."
00:26:38.472,00:27:01.412,trumpet man that no one else could play at his craft came up with the draft What?
00:27:01.454,00:27:02.580,It's a bonnie tune.
00:27:02.620,00:27:04.039,But you need a Scottish song.
00:27:04.457,00:27:05.541,Me?
00:27:09.128,00:27:10.379,And a new look.
00:27:20.264,00:27:21.639,That's jazzed you up a bit. Eh?
00:27:22.600,00:27:23.725,I look ridiculous.
00:27:34.903,00:27:37.448,Where did you find these clothes?
00:27:37.490,00:27:39.657,This is going to help us find Jamie how?
00:27:39.699,00:27:42.161,You nagged me to speed up the search.
00:27:42.202,00:27:48.666,"Well, a Sassenach lady dressed as a laddie, singing this bawdy song, that should spread the word."
00:27:50.169,00:27:51.795,"Well, I'm sure this isn't what I had in mind."
00:27:51.837,00:27:52.796,Mmm-mmm.
00:27:55.090,00:27:57.717,Bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the...
00:27:57.759,00:27:59.637,Stop quoting the Bible.
00:28:01.054,00:28:02.640,Right.
00:28:02.680,00:28:04.682,I've warmed them up with a wee jig.

00:30:01.091,00:30:03.260,There's a big redheaded lad come through these parts.
00:30:03.302,00:30:37.169,as the strathabogie wogie there's none as muckle It's our sixth village.
00:30:37.210,00:30:38.920,How long do you plan on doing this for?
00:30:38.962,00:30:41.590,"Well, as long as it takes."
00:30:41.632,00:30:43.634,Jamie kens the song you're singing well.
00:30:44.760,00:30:47.137,His Uncle Dougal used to sing it when he had too much drink.
00:30:49.389,00:30:52.851,You singing it is like lighting a beacon on a black night.
00:30:54.603,00:30:56.188,"I trust you, Murtagh, but..."
00:30:56.229,00:30:59.024,"And airing your doubts is just your way of showing that, then?"
00:31:01.485,00:31:03.153,No.
00:31:03.195,00:31:05.030,Then that'll be all on the subject?
00:31:06.281,00:31:07.866,Fine. I'll keep my mouth shut.
00:31:09.117,00:31:09.951,Aye.
00:31:11.244,00:31:13.497,"Till we reach the horses, I expect."
00:32:12.264,00:32:15.016,"For the show, any alms."
00:32:15.058,00:32:16.560,"Alms, alms for the show."
00:32:30.323,00:32:32.492,That flat-footed lummock has no feeling for the tune.
00:32:39.917,00:32:43.962,I'll see about securing a spot for you once this clodhopper is finished.
00:32:45.589,00:32:46.840,Crowd seems receptive enough.
00:32:58.894,00:33:04.023,"And now I give you, the Sassenach!"

00:33:47.651,00:33:50.779,A song is a song is a song.
00:33:52.948,00:33:55.492,They're like birds on the wing.
00:33:55.534,00:33:58.495,"If one can cage them, they own them."
00:33:59.621,00:34:01.790,"It's ours, you're filching it."
00:34:01.832,00:34:03.041,You won't be using it again.
00:34:03.082,00:34:10.215,What my companion is attempting to say is that it's a very special song.
00:34:10.256,00:34:12.050,That's precisely why we chose to use it.
00:34:12.968,00:34:14.386,Delivers the crowds.
00:34:15.012,00:34:20.099,"Not my taste, but the Highlanders seem to delight in ribald language."
00:34:20.141,00:34:21.643,And we added a proper dancer.
00:34:24.646,00:34:25.814,You have a servant.
00:34:26.815,00:34:28.066,Clearly you're in no need of funds.
00:34:30.193,00:34:36.074,A respectable English lady traveling through the Scottish countryside posing as an itinerant performer.
00:34:37.283,00:34:38.117,No.
00:34:39.870,00:34:43.081,You do this for either politics or love.
00:34:47.085,00:34:48.086,It's not politics.
00:34:50.255,00:34:52.925,You don't want to involve yourself in His Majesty's affairs.
00:34:53.800,00:34:56.094,"But love, after money..."
00:35:02.601,00:35:04.019,MURTAGH: Bloody Christ.
00:35:04.061,00:35:06.063,Since when do gypsies have hearts?
00:35:11.401,00:35:15.572,I'm searching for my husband and I have to sing that song.
00:35:16.990,00:35:22.037,"And once I have found him I promise you, I will never set foot on stage again."
00:35:39.638,00:35:40.555,You have my word.
00:35:48.229,00:35:50.065,MURTAGH: You might as well have dropped that money in a ditch.
00:35:51.024,00:35:52.442,His word is worth hee-haw.
00:35:52.484,00:35:54.444,Desperate times call for desperate measures.
00:35:54.486,00:35:56.655,I think it's what Jamie would've done.
00:35:56.696,00:35:58.615,You're no listening.
00:35:58.657,00:36:02.327,That gypsy all but told you he'd carry on performing that song if it earns him money.
00:36:02.368,00:36:06.790,I have to believe that a man who looks you in the eye and gives you his word will keep it.
00:36:09.167,00:36:11.044,The gypsy will keep using the song.
00:36:11.878,00:36:13.713,So you'll be singing it.
00:36:13.755,00:36:14.506,They'll be singing it.
00:36:15.966,00:36:18.593,Jamie won't know which song to come to.
00:36:21.888,00:36:23.181,Go on home to Lallybroch.
00:36:24.599,00:36:26.476,I'll track the gypsies.
00:36:26.518,00:36:27.936,Easier for me on my own.
00:36:28.812,00:36:30.188,You won't slow me down then.
00:36:31.148,00:36:34.442,"No, he is my husband."
00:36:34.484,00:36:36.069,You can't understand how that feels.
00:36:44.243,00:36:45.871,I'm pledged to the Laird.
00:36:45.912,00:36:48.247,And I am his lady.
00:36:48.289,00:36:51.835,And I'll continue singing that song until I find him.
00:37:47.432,00:37:49.893,"If you look hard enough, you might just see the Americas."
00:37:51.603,00:37:53.897,It's the only place you haven't sung that damn song yet.
00:38:14.126,00:38:15.168,Cannot sleep?
00:38:18.379,00:38:19.297,Of course not.
00:38:21.591,00:38:22.341,Good.
00:38:27.931,00:38:29.099,What does that mean?
00:38:31.643,00:38:33.019,I'm a fool for trailing after you.
00:38:34.312,00:38:35.480,At least I ken that much.
00:38:38.858,00:38:42.737,You're stubborn and you will not listen to anyone but your own self.
00:38:44.990,00:38:47.408,You insisted you'd carry on singing this song.
00:38:50.620,00:38:52.205,We've still no sign of the Laird.
00:38:53.873,00:38:55.458,Are you blaming me for our situation?
00:38:56.251,00:38:57.752,I am.
00:38:57.794,00:39:00.421,This whole farce was your plan.
00:39:04.592,00:39:06.427,Fine?
00:39:06.469,00:39:09.848,Nothing about this search has been fine.
00:39:12.309,00:39:16.604,Perhaps it has for you because you've never lost someone that you've loved.
00:39:18.273,00:39:19.524,"You ken it all now, do you lass?"
00:39:34.080,00:39:35.581,I lost someone...
00:39:38.626,00:39:42.172,...at a MacKenzie gathering many years ago.
00:39:44.423,00:39:46.592,My face had less weather on it then...
00:39:48.845,00:39:50.513,...and she was sonsie lassie...
00:39:54.100,00:39:56.394,...but she had another suitor.
00:39:58.479,00:39:59.397,So...
00:40:02.192,00:40:04.069,...I thought to prove myself worthy of her.
00:40:07.364,00:40:09.032,Be the kind of man she'd desire.
00:40:11.910,00:40:19.417,"During the Tynchal hunt, I alone killed a wounded boar using just a dagger."
00:40:23.255,00:40:28.509,"The MacKenzie was so impressed by the deed, he gave me the tusks."
00:40:31.429,00:40:36.393,I made them into bracelets and gave them to the lass as a wedding gift.
00:40:47.862,00:40:48.738,It was you?
00:41:16.849,00:41:18.476,You think you're the only one that loves Jamie?
00:41:21.479,00:41:22.939,He's a son to me.
00:41:28.903,00:41:30.405,I'm sorry.
00:41:33.532,00:41:35.034,I can't bear it.
00:42:08.443,00:42:09.694,What are we going to do now?
00:42:10.320,00:42:11.529,Where do we go?
00:42:13.865,00:42:18.161,"Until we ken otherwise, we go back to the beginning and start again."
00:42:23.791,00:42:24.750,All right.
00:42:26.336,00:42:27.545,First things first.
00:42:28.129,00:42:31.549,"The horses, they need to be fed and watered."
00:42:34.469,00:42:35.720,I gave away most of our money.
00:42:39.891,00:42:41.267,We'll manage something.
00:43:03.498,00:43:04.541,No.
00:43:08.461,00:43:09.670,You'll have a long and happy life.
00:43:20.973,00:43:27.897,"Mr. Ward, I didn't expect to see you again, unless you came to have your fortune read."
00:43:29.941,00:43:30.858,I broke my word.
00:43:31.984,00:43:35.238,We've been performing your song and doing quite well at it.
00:43:36.822,00:43:39.951,I had heard that gypsies aren't trustworthy.
00:43:39.992,00:43:41.786,I'd hoped it wasn't true.
00:43:41.827,00:43:43.829,"Well, I trust you haven't come all this way looking for absolution."
00:43:46.207,00:43:47.584,"Is everything all right here, lass?"
00:43:50.295,00:43:51.879,It's fine.
00:43:51.921,00:43:53.423,Mr. Ward was just leaving.
00:43:59.053,00:44:00.888,I'm here in the name of love.
00:44:05.268,00:44:07.312,A messenger left word.
00:44:07.353,00:44:08.771,And what's that got to do with us?
00:44:08.813,00:44:10.648,The message was for the lass playing your role.
00:44:11.732,00:44:12.900,"Clearly, it was meant for you."
00:44:17.322,00:44:19.407,"This message, what did it say?"
00:44:24.203,00:44:26.498,Even to those with the soul of a gypsy.
00:44:26.539,00:44:27.915,I'll give you nothing.
00:44:29.292,00:44:34.464,"Now, you better leave before my companion here decides to lend you a hand."
00:44:43.097,00:44:45.642,You're to go to Glen Rowan Cross with all due haste.
00:44:48.603,00:44:49.937,Is it Jamie?
00:44:49.979,00:44:50.980,He kens the place.
00:44:53.024,00:44:54.066,So do I.
00:44:56.693,00:44:57.694,Thank you.
00:44:59.864,00:45:01.073,From one gypsy to another.
00:45:37.860,00:45:38.735,Jamie!
00:45:51.374,00:45:53.750,I ken what you were hoping for.
00:45:56.671,00:45:58.256,I couldn't send for you by name.
00:46:01.551,00:46:05.388,Risk my location being found by those unsympathetic to the cause.
00:46:24.699,00:46:27.535,"Smuggling now, are we?"
00:46:29.662,00:46:31.788,I didn't send for you to debate politics.
00:46:32.873,00:46:35.585,You can stop your searching.
00:46:35.627,00:46:37.086,I've news of Jamie.
00:46:43.217,00:46:44.218,He's alive.
00:46:46.011,00:46:47.513,He was taken at Achnasheen.
00:46:49.432,00:46:51.100,Drawn by your song.
00:46:53.561,00:46:56.021,Met six Redcoats face-to-face around a turn in a path.
00:46:57.814,00:46:59.191,One recognized him.
00:47:00.985,00:47:01.902,Was he hurt?
00:47:03.529,00:47:04.739,He's in Wentworth Prison.
00:47:06.031,00:47:08.367,Stood trial three days ago.
00:47:09.744,00:47:10.827,Today?
00:47:10.869,00:47:11.828,Day after.
00:47:14.915,00:47:15.916,We have to hurry.
00:47:15.958,00:47:17.126,"Wait, wait."
00:47:17.168,00:47:18.795,"No, no, no, no."
00:47:18.835,00:47:20.212,"No, Murtagh."
00:47:20.254,00:47:22.173,"I need to have a word with the lady, alone."
00:47:29.305,00:47:30.306,I'll be fine.
00:47:57.667,00:48:02.921,"Claire, I understand that you're grieving. I do."
00:48:02.963,00:48:04.841,It's hard to accept that Jamie's gone.
00:48:04.881,00:48:06.300,I know that.
00:48:06.342,00:48:09.011,But you have to let him go.
00:48:11.013,00:48:11.888,You said he was still alive.
00:48:13.725,00:48:14.851,There must be something we can do.
00:48:14.891,00:48:16.185,There is.
00:48:16.227,00:48:16.977,Come back with me.
00:48:18.646,00:48:19.980,What?
00:48:20.022,00:48:22.859,I don't need protection.
00:48:22.899,00:48:25.528,"I can protect you, as your husband."
00:48:28.531,00:48:29.657,Get your hands off me.
00:48:29.699,00:48:30.783,"Now, listen to me, Claire."
00:48:30.825,00:48:32.284,I will do no such thing.
00:48:33.703,00:48:34.911,Have you no shame?
00:48:37.373,00:48:44.046,Your nephew lies rotting in prison under a death warrant and you make a play for his wife?
00:48:44.088,00:48:47.550,"I've never known you to act like an empty-headed woman before, so don't start now."
00:48:48.509,00:48:49.260,What about Geillis?
00:48:51.970,00:48:53.723,I thought she was your true soulmate.
00:48:55.516,00:48:59.520,Your star-crossed lover carrying your forbidden child.
00:49:06.151,00:49:11.783,"...and here you are looking for another woman, her friend, to warm your bed."
00:49:11.824,00:49:13.534,We won't talk about Geillis today.
00:49:14.577,00:49:15.620,This is about you.
00:49:17.413,00:49:18.790,You're a widow...
00:49:18.831,00:49:20.458,"Well, if not now, you soon will be."
00:49:20.499,00:49:22.376,An English widow.
00:49:22.418,00:49:25.296,"With no money, no property to call your own."
00:49:25.337,00:49:28.215,Save that poor Fraser land you'll inherit.
00:49:28.257,00:49:33.178,And how long do you think it'll be before Captain Jack Randall comes knocking at your door at Lallybroch?
00:49:33.220,00:49:35.431,"The Frasers will protect me, thank you very much."
00:49:35.473,00:49:37.767,In the same way they protected Jamie?
00:49:37.809,00:49:41.312,"No, you'll be back in his hands the minute he takes his fancy."
00:49:41.353,00:49:43.272,And there's nothing that those poor farmers can do about it.
00:49:44.607,00:49:49.904,I thought those poor farmers were going to be the backbone of your Jacobite army.
00:49:49.946,00:49:52.156,"You're being clever, not wise."
00:49:53.950,00:49:59.956,The only way to keep you and Lallybroch safe is to come under my protection.
00:49:59.996,00:50:01.666,As War Chieftain of the Clan MacKenzie.
00:50:08.756,00:50:09.799,Lallybroch?
00:50:12.969,00:50:14.386,So that's what this is really about?
00:50:16.263,00:50:18.307,You want to control the Fraser lands.
00:50:20.559,00:50:21.936,That's what you've wanted all along.
00:50:26.106,00:50:32.237,That's why you kept Jamie away for years by telling him his sister bore Randall's child.
00:50:34.740,00:50:40.329,Because you were hoping for an opportunity to bring them under the MacKenzie banner before their rightful Laird could return.
00:50:40.371,00:50:41.455,All that may be true.
00:50:45.083,00:50:47.043,But it doesn't alter your position.
00:50:47.085,00:50:49.755,"Now, what would Jamie want you to do?"
00:50:49.797,00:50:52.717,"Well, he wouldn't want me sleeping with his uncle."
00:50:52.758,00:50:55.135,"Hey, listen to me."
00:50:55.177,00:50:57.304,"He loved you, yes, I know that."
00:50:57.346,00:50:59.473,More than I suspected when I proposed you wed.
00:51:04.603,00:51:07.356,Don't you dare speak about him as if he were already dead.
00:51:07.398,00:51:12.361,"Now you think what you want of me, of my motives or of my politics, or even my honor."
00:51:12.403,00:51:15.031,But you know...
00:51:15.071,00:51:16.908,You know how he felt about Randall.
00:51:16.949,00:51:21.913,"If marrying me was the only way to keep you out of that bastard's hands, he would tell you to do it."
00:51:24.999,00:51:26.000,Now...
00:51:28.126,00:51:29.628,...look me in the eye and tell me I'm wrong.
00:51:51.025,00:51:52.108,How many men are there with you?
00:51:56.864,00:51:58.114,How many?
00:52:03.079,00:52:10.878,"I know what you're thinking, no way on earth that so few men can force their way into Wentworth Prison."
00:52:10.920,00:52:14.298,Jamie led only a handful of men when he rescued me at Fort William.
00:52:17.259,00:52:19.177,What's the matter?
00:52:19.219,00:52:20.888,Are you scared you're not as good as him?
00:52:25.101,00:52:26.435,"I'll not be baited by you, Claire."
00:52:28.228,00:52:29.647,You're blinded by love.
00:52:30.898,00:52:32.566,Wishing for things that can never be.
00:52:34.902,00:52:38.656,Would you give up your dream of a Stuart king on the throne without trying?
00:52:40.156,00:52:41.909,No.
00:52:41.951,00:52:43.911,And I won't give up on Jamie without trying.
00:52:43.953,00:52:45.245,He'll be dead before you get there.
00:52:48.124,00:52:49.165,And what then?
00:52:53.754,00:52:55.047,Then I'll marry you.
00:52:58.216,00:53:01.345,"If there's a chance that I can save him, then I have to try."
00:53:07.685,00:53:09.185,But if I fail...
00:53:10.896,00:53:19.655,"...or if he's already dead, I will marry you."
00:53:28.204,00:53:30.666,But I'll not stand in the way of any that choose to go.
00:53:52.521,00:53:54.230,"Look, I like the lad."
00:53:55.858,00:53:56.901,But it's Wentworth.
00:53:57.776,00:53:58.736,There's no chance.
00:53:59.904,00:54:01.321,Bloody cowards.
00:54:08.453,00:54:10.246,I understand your hesitation.
00:54:11.999,00:54:21.092,"What I'm asking is daunting, but I know, if the situation were reversed, Jamie would come for every single one of you."
00:54:21.133,00:54:24.803,The same MacKenzie blood runs through all your veins.
00:54:46.742,00:54:47.576,WILLIE: I'll go.
00:54:49.661,00:54:53.249,"Laddie, stop your nonsense and get back behind me."
00:54:53.289,00:54:55.960,You're too green to ken what you're saying.
00:54:56.001,00:54:57.669,Jamie's always looked after me.
00:54:57.711,00:54:59.588,Protected me.
00:54:59.630,00:55:01.381,On the road. At Leoch.
00:55:06.137,00:55:12.601,"And I ken if it was me about to meet the hangman's noose, he'd come for me, try to set me free."
00:55:14.352,00:55:16.312,"Whatever you call for, Mistress Claire."
00:55:17.982,00:55:19.399,My life is yours to command.
00:55:22.236,00:55:24.362,"Thank you, Willie."
00:55:24.404,00:55:27.741,You have more courage than all the rest of them put together.
00:55:31.954,00:55:33.329,You honor your blood.
00:55:34.790,00:55:35.833,Hell's fire.
00:55:43.174,00:55:44.716,"Aye, me neither."
00:55:46.010,00:55:50.139,"You see when this goes wrong, I'm killing you first for getting us involved."
00:55:50.181,00:55:52.808,Even before the Redcoats stretch your scrawny neck.
00:55:55.102,00:55:57.688,"Now, that was the easy part."
00:00:01.335,00:00:02.419,CLAIRE: Previously...
00:00:02.461,00:00:08.258,"I can draw up a petition of complaint, accusing Randall of crimes against the Scottish people."
00:00:08.300,00:00:14.765,If you can convince the Duke of Sandringham to deliver that document it could lead to a court martial for Black Jack.
00:00:16.517,00:00:20.145,"Make free of your body, and there will be no second flogging."
00:00:20.187,00:00:21.355,I couldn't do it.
00:00:21.396,00:00:23.231,Are we raiding the Chisolms today?
00:00:23.273,00:00:26.527,"I could do with a tall, strong Scotsman."
00:00:27.695,00:00:29.697,Where is Jamie?
00:00:32.533,00:00:35.953,CLAIRE: I knew full well if I had any hope of finding Jamie I'd need help.
00:00:35.995,00:00:37.162,I've news of Jamie.
00:00:37.204,00:00:39.665,"He's in Wentworth Prison, condemned to hang."
00:00:39.707,00:00:41.876,We have to hurry.
00:00:39.707,00:00:43.460,I'll not force any of my men to go to their deaths.
00:00:43.502,00:00:45.671,But I'll not stand in the way of any that choose to go.
00:02:41.078,00:02:42.537,"MACQUARRIE: I have to look on the bright side, Fraser."
00:02:44.873,00:02:48.752,Nothing like being hung to make your tossel stand up solid as an oak.
00:02:50.879,00:02:54.341,"JAMIE: Seems it's a little late to be brandishing iron, does it not?"
00:02:54.382,00:03:00.597,"MACQUARRIE: Ah, it takes the edge off of dying, knowing that when my neck snaps I'll be discharging my juice like a cannon blast."
00:03:05.519,00:03:08.856,"I heard tell, all that happens is ye shit yerself."
00:03:11.316,00:03:14.862,"Well, so much for me trying to cheer up a condemned man."
00:03:14.903,00:03:18.197,"Ye've got an awful dark view of the world, Fraser."
00:03:19.324,00:03:20.199,Lachlan Fife.
00:03:33.922,00:03:37.051,"JAMIE: When they come to get ye, I'll wrap my chain around their necks."
00:03:37.092,00:03:38.802,Ye grab his musket.
00:03:40.470,00:03:42.764,Not dogs. Men.
00:03:45.142,00:03:46.518,Is it the rope ye're afraid of?
00:03:48.520,00:03:50.064,No.
00:03:50.105,00:03:54.234,What grieves me is to think my wife will never forgive me for foolishly getting myself hung.
00:03:55.276,00:03:56.904,Aye.
00:04:00.657,00:04:07.497,"For me, I always knew I was fated to dangle from the end of a rope, so I made sure to leave none behind to mourn for me."
00:04:24.639,00:04:27.350,"Truth be told, I'm not looking forward to it much myself."
00:04:41.615,00:04:43.533,I'm not gonna let these bastards see it.
00:04:47.162,00:04:50.498,"I've got one regret, Fraser."
00:04:50.540,00:04:53.961,"Well, that I'll be climbing those stairs before you."
00:04:54.002,00:04:56.504,"Other way around, you could've put in a good word for me with St. Peter."
00:05:06.306,00:05:12.062,"To think my last view of the world will be a bunch of ill-faured, pasty-face Englishmen."
00:05:14.314,00:05:22.072,"My only regret is that I wasted my life as a common thief, rather than a patriot serving my country fighting against you lot."
00:05:22.114,00:05:24.658,To the devil with England and God bless King...
00:05:42.425,00:05:43.342,James Fraser.
00:06:45.822,00:06:47.157,RANDALL: Stop!
00:06:47.199,00:06:48.867,Stop the executions!
00:07:00.587,00:07:02.256,I'm on the King's business.
00:07:02.297,00:07:03.715,Take that man down and put him in a cell.
00:07:14.935,00:07:15.936,Remove the rope!
00:07:19.356,00:07:21.441,PRISON OFFICER: Escort the prisoner to one of the dungeon cells.
00:07:25.153,00:07:26.363,LIEUTENANT: Rory MacNeil.
00:08:09.030,00:08:11.950,"JAILOR: You must suffer from dodgy eyesight, mate."
00:08:14.661,00:08:20.708,"In 20 years, you might get that bolt loose except you ain't got 20 years."
00:08:20.750,00:08:26.423,"Compliments of Captain Jonathan Randall, Esquire."
00:08:26.465,00:08:37.225,"Must be good to have If you're smart, you'll eat a hearty meal, have a wash and your luck can change at any minute, boyo."
00:09:06.338,00:09:07.588,"SIR FLETCHER: Fraser, James."
00:09:10.717,00:09:13.220,And you say you know the prisoner?
00:09:16.515,00:09:19.100,Close relation?
00:09:21.478,00:09:25.399,"I hardly know the man, really."
00:09:25.440,00:09:29.403,An Englishwoman of fine breeding and a common Scottish criminal.
00:09:33.281,00:09:34.366,Here we are.
00:09:39.954,00:09:42.790,At least for a little while.
00:09:44.000,00:09:48.004,When was the last time you were in contact with this individual?
00:09:48.046,00:09:49.589,Many years.
00:09:49.630,00:09:55.803,"Old as the connection may be, I felt it a kind gesture to come visit."
00:10:03.478,00:10:07.607,My Christian duty.
00:10:10.944,00:10:14.489,I could tell you're a Christian woman the moment you entered.
00:10:17.784,00:10:20.287,"May I see him, Sir Fletcher?"
00:10:22.247,00:10:25.500,"I should like nothing better than to help you, Mrs. Beauchamp."
00:10:25.542,00:10:28.628,"Unfortunately, I cannot allow it."
00:10:28.669,00:10:31.631,"If something were to happen, I would never forgive myself."
00:10:33.800,00:10:36.677,"I understand your position, Sir Fletcher. I do."
00:10:36.719,00:10:40.723,But this man comes from good people.
00:10:40.765,00:10:45.979,How sad that a young man in this situation would be estranged from his family.
00:10:55.155,00:10:57.657,"You are thoughtfulness itself, my dear."
00:11:02.870,00:11:04.122,"One moment, madam."
00:11:39.907,00:11:44.162,I don't believe a letter directly from the convict would be appropriate.
00:11:44.204,00:11:46.414,"However, this may give the family solace."
00:11:48.625,00:11:50.460,The prisoner's personal effects.
00:11:53.463,00:12:00.053,"Customarily, we send them on to whomever the prisoner designates as next of kin after execution."
00:12:05.350,00:12:06.601,I'd be happy to.
00:12:08.520,00:12:12.148,"Well, then, I believe the Lord will smile upon you for this good deed."
00:12:53.856,00:12:56.443,"Up you get, lass."
00:13:14.793,00:13:15.878,Ooh...
00:13:17.338,00:13:19.090,Bastard! Bastard!
00:13:19.966,00:13:21.509,Five in a row?
00:13:21.551,00:13:23.802,MAN: Come on. It's me now.
00:13:31.978,00:13:35.398,"ANGUS: Aye, you've got the luck of the devil, you bastard!"
00:13:35.440,00:13:37.358,I've a few coins left.
00:13:37.400,00:13:39.444,Would you listen to those two donkeys?
00:13:39.486,00:13:43.364,Jamie's facing a neck stretching and all they care about is rolling double sixes.
00:13:43.406,00:13:45.824,I didn't realize Jamie's fate meant so little to them.
00:13:47.034,00:13:48.369,"Don't despair, mistress."
00:13:48.411,00:13:53.374,The boys here prised you out of Fort William right under Black Jack Randall's very nose.
00:13:53.416,00:13:56.461,And that was no easy task.
00:13:56.503,00:13:58.505,A fort's only there to keep people out.
00:13:58.546,00:14:00.839,A prison's there to keep people in.
00:14:07.722,00:14:09.808,ALL: Cheers!
00:14:17.524,00:14:19.150,MURTAGH: The next round is on the two of you.
00:14:19.192,00:14:20.777,And the one after that.
00:14:20.819,00:14:23.655,Think again. We're skint.
00:14:23.697,00:14:26.199,You seem awfully cheery about it.
00:14:26.240,00:14:29.619,"Well, it's who we lost to that has us grinning."
00:14:30.244,00:14:31.371,They need to know.
00:14:32.163,00:14:34.248,"By all means, tell them."
00:14:34.290,00:14:35.291,"What, me?"
00:14:35.333,00:14:37.084,"No, I think it should be you."
00:14:37.627,00:14:38.712,"Aye, but you..."
00:14:40.463,00:14:42.757,"Aye, but you kept ordering more ale."
00:14:42.799,00:14:44.884,"Kept their throats well lubricated, you did."
00:14:46.803,00:14:47.928,Sober up and speak yer piece.
00:14:48.971,00:14:51.432,"Oh, ho."
00:14:51.474,00:14:57.814,"While you three were sitting here looking glum, we were losing our coin to two..."
00:15:15.998,00:15:18.167,Those men work at the prison?
00:15:18.209,00:15:21.546,What did you learn?
00:15:21.588,00:15:25.299,The warden...
00:15:25.341,00:15:26.885,The very man.
00:15:26.926,00:15:31.013,He insists on having his evening meal in private.
00:15:31.055,00:15:34.559,"After which, he reads his Bible."
00:15:34.601,00:15:38.979,"Every day, 25 minutes of quiet reflection."
00:15:39.522,00:15:40.899,Introspection.
00:15:40.940,00:15:43.025,Self-examination.
00:15:45.612,00:15:47.947,The man's away from his office for a full hour.
00:15:51.075,00:15:51.951,Go on.
00:15:53.661,00:15:55.496,Isn't that enough? Hmm?
00:15:56.539,00:15:57.540,Yes.
00:16:00.668,00:16:02.044,I believe it is.
00:16:16.350,00:16:23.524,Who so pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil is right-wise King born of all Britain.
00:16:26.945,00:16:28.988,I wondered when ye'd show yerself.
00:16:35.495,00:16:37.288,Expected ye to come alone.
00:16:39.958,00:16:41.250,RANDALL: Marley?
00:16:41.292,00:16:45.212,Not much in the way of intellect but impressively brutal when given the opportunity.
00:16:46.965,00:16:51.010,"I apologize for the prison commissary, but I see you managed well enough."
00:16:52.553,00:16:53.596,Good for you.
00:16:57.517,00:17:05.065,"So, you couldn't keep out of prison long enough to hear if your pardon had been granted or not."
00:17:10.989,00:17:12.824,Your petition of complaint against me?
00:17:12.866,00:17:14.158,"Surely, you haven't forgotten."
00:17:25.336,00:17:26.253,You recognize this?
00:17:28.506,00:17:29.256,"Of course, you do."
00:17:44.814,00:17:48.943,Certain mutual acquaintances passed his words along to me and...
00:17:49.736,00:17:52.279,"Well, we spoke."
00:17:54.615,00:17:57.827,It certainly is a most extraordinary document.
00:18:01.748,00:18:04.083,"Well, a complete blackening of my character."
00:18:05.418,00:18:11.758,"If presented to the Court of Sessions, I would wager that they would find in your favor, and, well..."
00:18:14.343,00:18:17.263,I'd hate to think what would happen to me.
00:18:19.306,00:18:22.184,Might be me up on that gibbet instead of you.
00:18:50.088,00:18:52.632,Here to see Sir Fletcher.
00:18:52.673,00:18:53.883,"REDCOAT: Right this way, ma'am."
00:18:56.385,00:19:01.432,"Sir Fletcher didn't mention naught to me about having you back here, nor about any letter to pass along."
00:19:01.474,00:19:07.438,Are you implying that Sir Fletcher lied to me about Mr. Fraser being allowed to write a letter to his family?
00:19:07.480,00:19:08.648,Didn't say anything about lying.
00:19:10.024,00:19:12.068,"Then perhaps, you should ask him yourself."
00:19:12.110,00:19:14.946,Sir Fletcher is indisposed at present.
00:19:14.988,00:19:17.698,"Must I remind ye, ye're speaking to a lady?"
00:19:19.867,00:19:21.035,"Begging your pardon, Madam."
00:19:21.077,00:19:24.038,It's not often quality such as yourself visits this muck heap.
00:19:25.289,00:19:30.169,"Until Sir Fletcher returns, you can wait here, but don't go wandering."
00:19:30.210,00:19:32.379,Ain't a safe place for the fairer sex.
00:19:32.421,00:19:34.507,Your concern for my welfare is duly noted.
00:19:45.935,00:19:49.396,I suspect you've been on your feet for most of your shift.
00:19:49.438,00:19:50.606,Would you like to take a seat?
00:20:05.955,00:20:07.373,Are you trying to get me discharged?
00:20:07.414,00:20:08.958,I've got my duties to perform.
00:20:09.000,00:20:12.211,Of course. My apologies.
00:20:13.713,00:20:15.214,Be at ease.
00:20:15.255,00:20:17.424,I promise I shan't leave this room.
00:20:17.466,00:20:21.888,"And besides, I have my manservant here to protect me, should I be in need of such."
00:20:23.472,00:20:24.849,And who's gonna protect him?
00:20:33.273,00:20:35.359,"You're a bold lass, asking him to stay."
00:20:35.401,00:20:37.862,"I was afraid if I didn't, he might have come up with it himself."
00:20:52.168,00:20:53.753,RANDALL: May I call you Jamie?
00:21:00.509,00:21:01.802,I care not.
00:21:09.309,00:21:12.396,"No, that would be a waste of both our time."
00:21:12.438,00:21:16.234,"I am unable to save you now, even if I wished to."
00:21:16.275,00:21:20.780,Our time together here is but a momentary reprieve.
00:21:20.821,00:21:22.364,"Well, dinna bother."
00:21:22.406,00:21:25.076,I prefer the noose to yer company.
00:21:25.910,00:21:29.288,Is that true? Why?
00:21:29.329,00:21:31.540,Do I make you uncomfortable?
00:21:34.418,00:21:37.296,Do I haunt your dreams since Fort William?
00:21:39.966,00:21:50.059,"When you awaken in the middle of the night, shaken and sweating, is it my face you see looming in the darkness?"
00:21:50.601,00:21:51.477,Tell me.
00:21:53.312,00:22:10.079,"When you lie upon your wife and her hands trace the scars on your back, do you ever think of me and soften?"
00:22:10.121,00:22:11.330,"What is it you want from me, Randall?"
00:22:13.874,00:22:15.709,I want you to admit the truth to yourself.
00:22:15.751,00:22:18.004,And what would that be?
00:22:15.751,00:22:19.546,That you escaped Fort William but you did not escape me.
00:22:21.048,00:22:30.348,"Surrender this pride that you hide behind and admit that even now, you're terrified."
00:22:31.976,00:22:34.812,Admit it.
00:22:34.854,00:22:38.191,Admit that one simple thing and I will give you something in return.
00:22:40.276,00:22:41.819,A final gift.
00:22:50.161,00:22:51.411,A gift?
00:22:52.163,00:22:57.918,The noose is such an ignoble ending.
00:22:59.045,00:23:04.382,Give me what I ask and I will give you the death that you deserve.
00:23:05.343,00:23:11.389,"Clean, honorable and of your own choosing."
00:23:13.976,00:23:16.312,You could have a Roman death.
00:23:16.354,00:23:19.690,You could fall on your sword like Brutus.
00:23:19.732,00:23:24.028,Or maybe a Greek demise.
00:23:29.658,00:23:30.450,No.
00:23:32.703,00:23:37.415,Perhaps you do not want to see my face at the end.
00:23:38.251,00:23:39.793,I understand.
00:23:43.005,00:23:47.009,I can simply slit your throat from behind.
00:23:48.219,00:23:49.720,"It's messy, but..."
00:23:51.555,00:23:53.266,The choice is yours.
00:24:08.072,00:24:10.448,How will I ever choose?
00:24:14.036,00:24:16.914,But choose you must.
00:24:16.956,00:24:19.250,"First, you must give me your surrender."
00:24:19.959,00:24:21.627,Make no mistake.
00:24:21.668,00:24:25.256,I will have your surrender before you leave this world.
00:24:34.932,00:24:37.935,"Claire, we've looked all over."
00:24:37.977,00:24:40.729,"Well, what good are keys if we don't know where he's being held?"
00:24:45.985,00:24:49.196,"HEAD JAILOR: Thought I'd check in on you, Mrs. Beauchamp, make sure you're..."
00:25:02.335,00:25:03.877,Tie him up and hide him somewhere.
00:25:03.919,00:25:07.673,"With a bit of luck, I'll be able to find Jamie before the alarm is sounded."
00:25:07.714,00:25:09.425,No.
00:25:09.467,00:25:13.637,"If I get caught, I can say that you quarreled with the jailor and I fled for help."
00:25:15.555,00:25:17.933,Tell them that I sent you out to get a gift for Sir Fletcher.
00:25:17.975,00:25:20.478,"Remember, you work for an Englishwoman of noble birth."
00:25:20.518,00:25:24.482,"And you remember, ye've got less than an hour before Sir Fletcher returns."
00:25:24.564,00:25:26.275,Meet me in the woods behind the prison.
00:25:26.317,00:25:27.525,We'll be waiting for you.
00:25:31.322,00:25:33.324,"Good luck to you, too, lass."
00:26:09.818,00:26:11.987,MAN: But if you two can't give it a rest...
00:26:13.697,00:26:15.908,"MAN 2: Not likely, boyo."
00:26:34.968,00:26:36.887,Jamie?
00:26:36.929,00:26:38.138,Are you there?
00:26:45.896,00:26:46.980,"MAN: Let us out, lass."
00:26:47.773,00:26:49.733,"Wait, come back."
00:26:52.903,00:26:54.196,Jamie?
00:26:56.907,00:26:57.824,Jamie!
00:26:59.577,00:27:01.995,Does anyone know where I would find Jamie Fraser?
00:27:07.000,00:27:10.588,Not in here. Try down below.
00:27:10.628,00:27:13.840,That's where they keep those of us that hanging's too good for.
00:27:14.632,00:27:15.717,Thank you.
00:27:39.492,00:27:40.493,All right.
00:27:55.090,00:27:56.674,I won't surrender.
00:27:58.302,00:28:03.681,To you or any man.
00:28:04.766,00:28:12.316,"I have to admit, there is a part of me that would be crestfallen if you did."
00:28:19.657,00:28:21.617,You know that every man can be broken.
00:28:21.659,00:28:23.994,It's truly nothing to be ashamed of.
00:28:29.416,00:28:30.876,Will you show me your back?
00:28:46.475,00:28:47.726,If it'll stop yer talking.
00:28:48.644,00:28:49.769,Hmm.
00:29:08.080,00:29:09.289,May I?
00:29:30.394,00:29:31.895,You're the broken one.
00:29:31.937,00:29:33.772,Ye're the one that sees my face every night.
00:30:31.997,00:30:35.208,Idiot. You could have killed him.
00:30:43.592,00:30:44.593,Get him up.
00:30:47.304,00:30:48.806,"Do it, dog! Get him up."
00:31:04.446,00:31:06.740,I truly hoped to spare you the noose.
00:31:06.782,00:31:08.867,Hold his wrist.
00:31:49.533,00:31:52.285,Why do you force me to treat you in such an abominable way?
00:31:57.750,00:31:59.334,Why do you force me to hurt you?
00:31:59.376,00:32:00.669,Hmm?
00:32:00.711,00:32:01.920,You're better than this.

00:32:44.922,00:32:46.298,Can you feel that?
00:32:49.676,00:32:53.096,No. I'll kill you.

00:32:55.432,00:32:56.433,It's all right.
00:32:58.936,00:33:00.061,I could take you right now.
00:33:13.867,00:33:14.868,No.
00:33:16.829,00:33:18.580,I will not give in to coarse passion.
00:33:37.891,00:33:41.019,If you'd only stop resisting me I could make this so much easier for you.
00:33:41.060,00:33:43.021,I'm here to help you.
00:35:34.424,00:35:36.593,Jamie? Jamie.
00:35:47.353,00:35:49.064,You must leave.
00:35:49.106,00:35:52.901,Randall will be coming back soon.
00:35:52.943,00:35:55.821,My God.

00:36:01.118,00:36:02.160,But you must leave.
00:36:02.911,00:36:04.955,No. Not without you.
00:36:11.128,00:36:12.337,"Talk to me, Jamie."
00:36:14.965,00:36:16.842,Wake up.
00:36:16.883,00:36:20.345,Jamie? You must stay awake.
00:36:20.386,00:36:21.847,We're going to walk out of here together.

00:37:08.101,00:37:12.438,I should have slit your throat when you were laying unconscious at Fort William.
00:37:13.982,00:37:14.983,Yes.
00:37:16.776,00:37:19.612,I'm afraid you will come to regret that small act of humanity.
00:37:23.241,00:37:24.325,You're no coward.
00:37:28.413,00:37:35.336,You're a fit match for you husband and I cannot give you a better compliment than that.

00:51:22.329,00:51:24.289,None.
00:51:24.331,00:51:30.504,For it means risking the Redcoats coming around afterwards and leveling Eldridge House to the ground.
00:51:30.546,00:51:33.632,"No lass, I'm sorry."
00:51:33.674,00:51:39.304,"Temporary shelter I can offer ye, but I'll not put my family or myself in jeopardy."
00:51:47.563,00:51:49.065,I can pay you.
00:51:49.105,00:51:51.567,I wouldn't ask your men to risk their lives for nothing.
00:51:51.609,00:51:53.778,A half dozen or so would give us a fighting chance.

00:52:11.545,00:52:13.756,That's right.
00:52:13.798,00:52:15.424,My husband gave them to me on our wedding night.

00:53:05.099,00:53:06.350,"Ah, I see."
00:53:07.977,00:53:11.063,But what I cannot see is how it can be done.

00:53:36.463,00:53:38.007,It'll have to do.

00:53:39.675,00:53:41.969,I left the door open at the rear of the prison.
00:53:42.011,00:53:44.220,"An open door is nay a plan, lass."
00:53:47.558,00:53:48.517,Anyone?
00:53:57.651,00:54:00.696,It gives me no pleasure to say such...
00:54:01.697,00:54:04.616,Absalom! Man!
00:54:04.658,00:54:09.454,I sent you out at daybreak to bring in 40 head of cattle!
00:54:09.496,00:54:11.373,What have you been up to all that time?
00:54:11.415,00:54:14.668,Searching! All bloody day!
00:54:14.710,00:54:18.047,"Well, ye sure as shite didn't go thirsty."
00:54:18.089,00:54:19.506,How many did you bring in?
00:54:24.845,00:54:28.473,Nineteen out of 40?
00:54:28.515,00:54:31.852,"What are ye, blind, man?"
00:54:31.894,00:54:33.604,Nineteen cattle.
00:54:34.939,00:54:37.524,That's no small number.
00:54:37.566,00:54:41.946,And what the hell is so funny about 21 missing cattle?
00:54:43.155,00:54:45.281,I know how we can save young Jamie.
00:00:01.335,00:00:02.628,CLAIRE: Previously...
00:00:02.670,00:00:04.254,DOUGAL: I've news of Jamie.
00:00:04.296,00:00:06.131,Stood trial three days ago.
00:00:06.173,00:00:08.049,RANDALL: Stop the executions!
00:00:14.389,00:00:17.058,"With a bit of luck, I'll be able to find Jamie before the alarm is sounded."
00:00:19.144,00:00:20.562,Let her go in safety and you can have me.
00:00:20.604,00:00:21.981,You have my word.
00:00:22.021,00:00:22.940,"RANDALL: So, it becomes a matter of trust."
00:00:25.233,00:00:27.444,I can't leave you.
00:00:27.486,00:00:29.070,Do as I say.
00:00:29.112,00:00:30.071,No!
00:00:32.825,00:00:34.034,CLAIRE: I can get us inside.
00:00:34.075,00:00:36.286,I left a door open at the rear of the prison.
00:00:36.328,00:00:38.038,I know how we can save young Jamie.
00:00:42.334,00:00:43.251,RANDALL: It's a masterpiece.
00:02:26.939,00:02:29.566,SOLDIER: Hey! Royal salute!
00:02:29.608,00:02:31.318,Present arms!
00:02:31.359,00:02:33.654,ALL: God save King George!
00:04:00.866,00:04:02.242,"Soldiers, your firearms!"
00:04:06.163,00:04:07.455,SOLDIER: Stand at ease!
00:05:31.206,00:05:33.250,"Three cheers for His Majesty, King George."
00:05:33.292,00:05:34.459,Hip hip!
00:05:34.501,00:05:35.585,Hip hip!
00:05:35.627,00:05:36.670,Hip hip!
00:06:27.846,00:06:29.723,"Easy, lad. Easy."
00:06:29.764,00:06:31.641,We're getting you out of here. Aye!
00:07:32.744,00:07:33.912,Is he alive?
00:07:33.954,00:07:35.830,"Aye, he needs tending, but it'll have to wait."
00:07:35.872,00:07:37.498,The hell it will!
00:07:37.540,00:07:38.959,I can't believe you actually did it.
00:07:45.548,00:07:48.676,We must make haste.
00:07:53.223,00:07:55.183,What did Randall do to you?
00:07:55.225,00:07:57.685,"I don't mean to speak ill of the lad, but he positively reeks."
00:07:59.729,00:08:02.565,It's oil of lavender.
00:08:02.607,00:08:03.858,"Someone tried to tend him, then?"
00:08:05.152,00:08:06.694,Maybe.
00:08:06.736,00:08:08.405,Go back and watch the road behind us.
00:08:08.447,00:08:12.367,"If ye see any sign of pursuit, come running like the devil and we'll have to take our chances."
00:08:12.409,00:08:13.493,CLAIRE: Jamie.
00:08:14.786,00:08:16.288,Jamie.
00:08:17.080,00:08:18.373,You're safe now.
00:08:18.415,00:08:20.917,"I'm going to help you, I swear."
00:08:27.257,00:08:28.758,"Get off her, lad! Jamie!"
00:08:30.551,00:08:31.928,"What's wrong with ye, lad?"
00:08:37.017,00:08:38.518,She's just trying to help ye.
00:08:43.148,00:08:44.524,What is he saying?
00:08:44.565,00:08:46.734,He's deleeriet.
00:08:46.776,00:08:49.363,"Pardon the interruption, but will ye be wanting tea?"
00:08:49.404,00:08:51.198,Or can I get this wagon moving?
00:09:25.065,00:09:27.692,"WILLIE: Father Anselm, this is Mrs. Claire Fraser."
00:09:27.734,00:09:32.030,The Father's agreed to give us shelter until we can find a more permanent situation.
00:09:32.072,00:09:34.241,Thank you.
00:09:37.077,00:09:40.163,The boy has told us of your needs and all is waiting for you.
00:09:40.205,00:09:41.456,Thank you.
00:09:50.131,00:09:52.175,"JAMIE: No, no."
00:09:52.217,00:09:53.427,CLAIRE: Jamie.
00:09:53.468,00:09:55.178,It's all right.
00:09:58.890,00:10:04.020,"I've no doubt you can mend his body, but there are other wounds, not so easily dealt with."
00:10:05.564,00:10:10.651,"His soul, I'm afraid, is in turmoil."
00:10:10.693,00:10:13.447,"If I don't set that hand, he'll be crippled for life."
00:10:14.906,00:10:15.907,JAMIE: Claire.
00:10:19.869,00:10:21.621,Please. Excuse us.
00:10:35.635,00:10:36.803,Brother Paul was right.
00:10:37.845,00:10:38.972,You need your nourishment.
00:10:42.016,00:10:43.226,Dinna touch me.
00:10:49.483,00:10:50.650,"Jamie, talk to me."
00:10:53.694,00:10:55.029,What did Randall do to you?
00:10:58.617,00:10:59.659,Too much.
00:11:02.412,00:11:03.622,And not enough.
00:11:23.558,00:11:25.560,You saw her leave these walls?
00:11:26.144,00:11:28.104,Yes.
00:11:28.146,00:11:29.439,We are both men of our word.
00:11:31.525,00:11:32.651,Drink.
00:11:40.699,00:11:41.951,"Ah, ah, ah."
00:11:48.166,00:11:50.126,Let's see if we can make you more comfortable.
00:12:34.795,00:12:35.754,It's all right.
00:12:39.967,00:12:42.554,"The worst is over now, you'll see."
00:12:57.110,00:12:58.111,Dear God.
00:12:59.195,00:13:00.779,You are a magnificent creature.
00:13:34.897,00:13:36.566,It's like kissing a corpse.
00:13:52.957,00:13:55.418,My men can have Claire back here within the hour.
00:13:56.544,00:13:57.836,We have an agreement.
00:14:00.548,00:14:01.924,That I would not resist.
00:14:01.966,00:14:02.841,Ah.
00:14:03.635,00:14:04.843,So that's your plan.
00:14:16.189,00:14:18.775,"Well, we will see about that."
00:15:03.152,00:15:04.362,How does that feel?
00:15:25.842,00:15:27.802,Don't play the worm with me.
00:15:30.346,00:15:35.560,"Jamie, I just want this to be a pleasant experience for us both."
00:15:45.319,00:15:46.696,Do what you must.
00:15:57.498,00:15:58.708,What I must?
00:16:13.431,00:16:16.183,You think I cannot control the darkness I inhabit.
00:16:28.613,00:16:31.115,"One way or another, I will get a response from you."
00:16:47.841,00:16:48.883,Scream.
00:16:51.177,00:16:52.178,Scream.
00:16:56.975,00:16:58.225,Scream!
00:17:14.534,00:17:17.036,"BROTHER PAUL: Ye'd be wise to do as she says, lad."
00:17:17.077,00:17:20.414,The laudanum will help ye sleep through this trying time.
00:17:20.456,00:17:22.542,Whiskey will do me fine.
00:17:22.583,00:17:24.961,"Jamie, I'm about to set nine bones in your hand."
00:17:26.880,00:17:30.508,Randall made me crawl.
00:17:33.469,00:17:34.595,Made me beg.
00:17:38.683,00:17:41.644,"Before he was done, he made me want verra badly to be dead."
00:17:45.773,00:17:50.361,"Well, you're not dead, and I refuse to let you spend the rest of your life a cripple."
00:17:51.111,00:17:52.154,So let me do my job.
00:17:53.280,00:17:54.240,Do as you wish.
00:17:59.662,00:18:01.080,It matters not to me.
00:18:02.373,00:18:03.249,Jamie.
00:18:16.012,00:18:18.222,CLAIRE: I need water and clean cloth.
00:18:20.600,00:18:21.893,CLAIRE: What about thread?
00:18:21.935,00:18:23.644,"BROTHER PAUL: I have clean thread, too."
00:18:31.778,00:18:42.455,"CLAIRE: During the war, I had treated men in far worse shape, their horrific injuries almost unfathomable to the human mind, but none of them were my husband."
00:18:43.998,00:18:46.709,"It was a long, nerve-wracking job."
00:18:46.751,00:18:51.130,"Some parts, such as the splinting of the two fingers with simple fractures went quite easily."
00:18:52.673,00:18:54.842,Other's did not.
00:18:54.884,00:19:01.140,Setting his middle finger required exerting considerable force in order to draw the ends of the splintered bone back through the skin.
00:19:04.727,00:19:11.233,"Jamie had said to me once, I can bear pain myself, but I could not bear yours."
00:19:11.275,00:19:12.986,That would take more strength than I have.
00:19:14.403,00:19:15.237,He was right.
00:19:16.155,00:19:17.364,It did take strength.
00:19:18.741,00:19:20.534,I hoped that each of us had enough.
00:19:24.956,00:19:28.167,I began to lose awareness of anything outside the job I was doing.
00:19:31.211,00:19:35.883,"I was afraid of infection, particularly, but otherwise was fairly sure the fingers would heal."
00:19:37.176,00:19:42.473,"The shattered joint would likely leave him with a stiff ring finger, but the others might function normally in time."
00:20:00.616,00:20:01.868,BROTHER PAUL: I will stay with him through the night.
00:20:03.077,00:20:04.662,You'll need your strength. Come.
00:20:06.998,00:20:10.334,"I will send for you, should he awaken, or there be any need."
00:21:28.121,00:21:30.289,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt your prayers."
00:21:34.210,00:21:36.087,I wasn't exactly praying.
00:21:37.171,00:21:39.799,"I was just sitting here alone, trying to clear my head."
00:21:41.801,00:21:43.094,Were you indeed alone?
00:21:48.808,00:21:49.892,Please.
00:22:01.320,00:22:03.197,Would you like me to hear your confession?
00:22:10.871,00:22:12.248,Perhaps not.
00:22:12.290,00:22:14.333,"But I assure you, he will understand."
00:22:21.799,00:22:24.760,My name is Claire Beauchamp Randall Fraser.
00:22:42.611,00:22:43.654,Go on.
00:22:46.324,00:23:01.297,"Eight months ago, I was on holiday with my husband in Inverness, in the year of our Lord, 1945."
00:23:12.183,00:23:13.809,CLAIRE: I told him everything.
00:23:15.435,00:23:17.479,I happened upon some standing stones...
00:23:17.521,00:23:18.522,Exactly like my husband...
00:23:20.191,00:23:21.984,He attacked me...
00:23:22.026,00:23:23.986,Was rescued by my Highlander...
00:23:27.740,00:23:30.368,I found myself very much in love...
00:23:30.408,00:23:31.451,Seemed like the only solution...
00:23:31.493,00:23:33.037,He was prepared to let me go...
00:23:33.079,00:23:34.121,I couldn't leave him...
00:23:34.163,00:23:35.164,I was accused of being a witch...
00:23:35.206,00:23:36.832,Jamie came to my rescue...
00:23:36.874,00:23:40.211,"Captain Randall, did the most unspeakable things to him."
00:23:46.259,00:23:47.425,CLAIRE: But it's my fault.
00:24:07.487,00:24:08.446,Extraordinary!
00:24:10.699,00:24:11.909,"A miracle, perhaps."
00:24:15.537,00:24:16.580,A miracle?
00:24:20.418,00:24:24.462,"Somehow, I don't think canon law was constructed with my situation in mind."
00:24:25.381,00:24:27.049,True.
00:24:27.091,00:24:29.176,"But, our Lord sees the truth in all things."
00:24:35.891,00:24:40.229,"Whatever your sins might be, have faith that they will be forgiven."
00:25:09.758,00:25:10.550,JAMIE: Mmm.
00:25:20.518,00:25:22.480,How's our patient this morning?
00:25:22.520,00:25:24.398,Stubborn. Very stubborn.
00:25:29.236,00:25:30.654,You need sustenance.
00:25:39.830,00:25:41.040,I was afraid of that.
00:25:54.428,00:26:01.727,"Once we have you healed up, we can begin a regime of massage and exercise, see if we can't get that ring finger bending properly."
00:26:03.312,00:26:05.231,We need to get his fever down.
00:26:05.272,00:26:07.691,I'll need a bucket of the coldest water you can find.
00:26:08.734,00:26:10.652,The burn is icy in the mornings.
00:26:10.694,00:26:13.739,That'll do.
00:26:13.780,00:26:14.907,I'll see you get all you need.
00:26:20.454,00:26:24.375,JAMIE: You canna save a man that doesna want saving.
00:26:32.550,00:26:35.010,"Hey, go on."
00:26:35.052,00:26:38.180,"Staying sober isna going to heal Jamie any faster, eh?"
00:26:38.222,00:26:39.597,It's not his wounds I'm worried about.
00:26:41.016,00:26:42.393,It's the not eating.
00:26:44.395,00:26:46.397,Tree fell on him.
00:26:46.439,00:26:48.274,Lost it up to the shoulder.
00:26:50.359,00:26:52.486,Refused to take even a mouthful of bread.
00:26:54.321,00:26:55.613,Starved himself to death.
00:26:58.576,00:26:59.868,Not that I'm comparing Jaime to...
00:27:01.954,00:27:03.330,Ah!
00:27:10.628,00:28:32.336,JAMIE: RANDALL: Am I close?
00:28:36.840,00:28:38.467,Have you reached your limit yet?
00:28:55.568,00:28:57.152,What shall I do with you?
00:29:04.702,00:29:05.827,Claire.
00:29:08.747,00:29:10.249,RANDALL: What is her power?
00:29:11.083,00:29:13.335,Possesses you even now?
00:29:15.629,00:29:16.755,What is her secret?
00:29:18.006,00:29:19.007,Tell me.
00:29:25.138,00:29:26.098,She's gone.
00:29:37.109,00:29:38.777,There's no more Claire.
00:29:49.663,00:29:50.872,Then are you mine?
00:29:55.168,00:29:56.253,Are you mine?
00:30:02.217,00:30:03.343,JAMIE: You.
00:30:07.389,00:30:10.225,There's only you.
00:31:09.909,00:31:11.161,Show me you're mine.
00:31:12.037,00:31:13.038,Huh?
00:31:17.167,00:31:18.377,Show me.
00:32:13.223,00:32:15.225,I spotted two Redcoat patrols.
00:32:15.267,00:32:17.060,RUPERT: But they dinna see you?
00:32:17.102,00:32:18.437,"WILLIE: One was headed south, the other east."
00:32:18.478,00:32:19.813,Lucky for us.
00:32:19.855,00:32:20.939,MURTAGH: Won't be long before they head north.
00:32:21.981,00:32:23.400,The monastery's no place for a fight.
00:32:27.112,00:32:28.947,It's clear Jamie's not thriving here.
00:32:30.824,00:32:32.200,Go where?
00:32:32.242,00:32:34.703,There's no place safe for ye in Scotland.
00:32:34.745,00:32:36.830,"Not Leoch, not Lallybroch."
00:32:36.872,00:32:38.582,Ye'll have to flee the country.
00:32:38.624,00:32:40.834,The MacKenzies know people in Paris.
00:32:40.876,00:32:43.629,"They can take ye in, provide shelter, eh?"
00:32:43.670,00:32:45.798,There are Frasers in France as well.
00:32:45.839,00:32:47.382,Jamie and I have a cousin.
00:32:47.424,00:32:50.176,The man's a merchant.
00:32:50.218,00:32:52.471,You need someone who can defend against...
00:32:52.512,00:32:55.808,"Mistress Claire, do you not have yer own family in France?"
00:32:55.849,00:32:58.811,Is that not where you were headed when we first encountered ye?
00:32:58.852,00:33:00.353,Perhaps they would take ye in?
00:33:00.395,00:33:05.776,"Yes, but they were relatives of my late husband and most likely wouldn't welcome me in my current circumstances."
00:33:06.777,00:33:09.613,I think Jamie would prefer to be with members of the Fraser clan.
00:33:09.655,00:33:12.950,No offense.
00:33:12.991,00:33:15.118,Aye. The MacKenzies will always stand with ye.
00:33:16.286,00:33:18.121,I know they will.
00:33:19.331,00:33:20.999,Then I best secure us a ship.
00:33:43.981,00:33:47.025,"For France, where ye can forget this ever happened."
00:33:52.614,00:33:54.073,Ye need to keep yer strength up.
00:33:55.074,00:33:56.034,Ye must eat for...
00:33:57.536,00:33:59.579,For Mistress Claire's sake if not for yer own.
00:34:03.041,00:34:07.379,She loves you fiercely and ye have her worried sick.
00:34:23.645,00:34:24.521,JAMIE: Yer blade.
00:34:27.566,00:34:28.441,Hand it over.
00:34:32.111,00:34:34.573,To put me out of this black misery.
00:34:37.617,00:34:38.952,"Jamie, ye don't mean it."
00:34:44.833,00:34:46.084,"Now, hand it over."
00:34:47.627,00:34:49.087,Give it to me.
00:34:55.594,00:34:57.054,MURTAGH: I was just coming to see you.
00:34:59.598,00:35:01.016,It's a bit dear.
00:35:04.143,00:35:06.104,Willie said Jamie asked him to kill him.
00:35:10.817,00:35:11.944,Did you know?
00:35:20.827,00:35:23.914,I've been praying ye'd be able to talk some sense into the lad.
00:35:24.831,00:35:25.958,That he'd come around.
00:35:25.999,00:35:27.042,Why?
00:35:35.425,00:35:36.635,Raped.
00:35:38.637,00:35:39.930,Isn't that reason enough?
00:35:47.395,00:35:48.354,Aye.
00:35:53.485,00:36:01.118,"The lad's taken his share of punishment, but I can't help feeling there's more here than we know."
00:36:09.292,00:36:10.543,"I'm sorry, Claire."
00:36:12.211,00:36:13.379,I'm truly sorry.
00:36:16.299,00:36:18.176,I'd never do anything to hurt that lad...
00:36:21.054,00:36:22.180,Unless.
00:36:24.766,00:36:25.851,Unless?
00:36:28.103,00:36:30.897,I'll not watch Jamie waste away.
00:36:32.858,00:36:36.111,Die like an animal in the woods with his foot caught in a trap.
00:36:51.751,00:36:52.752,There we go.
00:36:53.837,00:36:55.213,Feeling better?
00:36:57.799,00:36:59.467,"Whoa. Whoa, whoa."
00:37:00.802,00:37:02.303,Ye collapsed like a sack of grain.
00:37:02.345,00:37:04.139,Scared the piss right out of me.
00:37:10.478,00:37:13.231,What am I going to do?
00:37:15.400,00:37:22.407,"Well, his wounds are progressing nicely, but his soul remains possessed by darkness."
00:37:23.033,00:37:28.872,I fear he will writhe in torment until he makes an end of himself.
00:37:28.914,00:37:32.333,Unless he can be led back into the light.
00:37:32.375,00:37:35.253,"I don't mean to disagree with ye, Brother, but I know Jamie."
00:37:36.755,00:37:40.258,"And light or no light, none can lead him where he doesna want to go."
00:37:41.467,00:37:43.678,Are ye saying the lad's doomed?
00:37:43.720,00:37:48.892,I'm saying that maybe the only way to save Jamie is for someone to step into the darkness with him.
00:38:28.723,00:38:30.475,Oil of lavender.
00:38:31.768,00:38:33.561,What are you doing?
00:38:33.603,00:38:35.939,I've left you be for far too long.
00:38:35.981,00:38:37.983,Treated you too gently.
00:38:38.024,00:38:39.692,"That doesn't work with you, does it?"
00:38:39.734,00:38:41.194,"No, you only respond to strength."
00:38:41.236,00:38:42.361,Why are you doing this?
00:38:42.403,00:38:43.905,You know why!
00:38:43.947,00:38:47.117,To find out exactly what happened in that room between you and Randall.
00:38:47.159,00:38:48.451,What you're holding back.
00:38:48.493,00:38:50.203,You already know.
00:38:51.871,00:38:53.123,There is no else.
00:38:53.165,00:38:55.041,Then why can't you look at me?
00:38:55.083,00:38:56.918,Look at me! Do it!
00:38:56.960,00:38:58.170,Look at me!
00:38:58.211,00:38:59.420,No!
00:39:09.097,00:39:11.308,"Claire, please!"
00:39:11.349,00:39:12.851,"CLAIRE: It's a bit late for that, isn't it?"
00:39:12.892,00:39:15.394,My husband wants to kill himself and he won't tell me why!
00:39:15.436,00:39:17.314,Do you want me to hate you?
00:39:17.355,00:39:18.648,Do you want me to hate you!
00:39:28.533,00:39:29.534,He branded you?
00:39:40.128,00:39:41.338,"JAMIE: No, you're wrong."
00:39:50.847,00:39:51.848,He didn't brand me.
00:39:55.894,00:39:57.062,I did it myself.
00:40:01.900,00:40:03.235,We can remove it.
00:40:04.027,00:40:05.237,You canna understand.
00:40:05.737,00:40:06.738,Claire.
00:40:07.864,00:40:08.948,It wasn't...
00:40:11.701,00:40:15.788,Randall didn't just use force to get what he wanted from me.
00:40:21.253,00:40:22.420,"Claire, it wasn't..."
00:40:25.965,00:40:27.217,Go on.
00:40:29.510,00:40:30.469,Say it.
00:40:36.684,00:40:38.436,"He made love to me, Claire."
00:40:44.401,00:40:45.443,And I...
00:40:50.990,00:40:52.284,What?
00:41:37.829,00:41:38.913,RANDALL: Breathe in.
00:41:42.417,00:41:44.002,That's oil of lavender.
00:42:12.489,00:42:13.906,RANDALL: These are Claire's hands.
00:42:19.078,00:42:20.455,Think of Claire.
00:42:25.001,00:42:26.294,Think of your wife.
00:43:21.766,00:43:22.934,Wait for me.
00:44:07.103,00:44:08.229,Claire's here.
00:44:38.343,00:44:40.219,"Say my name, Jamie."
00:44:49.937,00:44:50.896,Claire.
00:45:41.113,00:45:42.739,How could she ever forgive you?
00:45:52.500,00:45:53.834,"I couldna help myself, Claire."
00:45:55.878,00:45:59.716,It felt so good.
00:46:01.300,00:46:02.301,Not to be in pain.
00:46:08.516,00:46:10.476,Were you afraid I wouldn't forgive you?
00:46:13.605,00:46:15.772,There's nothing to forgive.
00:46:18.901,00:46:20.027,"Jamie, it's..."
00:46:20.986,00:46:21.862,It's all right.
00:46:25.491,00:46:26.743,Don't you see?
00:46:32.164,00:46:34.125,I canna be your husband any longer.
00:46:36.793,00:46:39.255,And I will not be less to you.
00:46:39.297,00:46:41.882,You did what was necessary to survive.
00:46:41.924,00:46:43.718,"No. No, he broke me."
00:46:44.385,00:46:45.428,"He broke me, Claire."
00:46:46.638,00:46:47.846,He knew it.
00:46:50.475,00:46:52.310,You belong to no one else but me.
00:46:53.436,00:46:55.730,And I belong to you.
00:46:57.856,00:46:59.816,"Those are just weak words, Claire."
00:47:09.868,00:47:17.627,"I lie here, feeling I will die without your touch, but when you do touch me, I want to vomit with shame."
00:47:18.043,00:47:19.337,No.
00:47:19.378,00:47:21.631,"You're my husband, James Fraser."
00:47:21.673,00:47:23.257,How dare you give up on me now!
00:47:24.841,00:47:29.846,"You swore to me, you promised me the protection of your body if need be."
00:47:31.098,00:47:36.979,"Well, Randall had your body, but I'll be damned if he has your soul as well."
00:47:39.148,00:47:40.191,You're mine.
00:47:47.072,00:47:50.117,It's the only explanation I have for all this.
00:47:50.159,00:47:54.997,It's the only way I can wrap my mind around what's happened all these past months.
00:48:26.945,00:48:28.614,"With you, right here, now."
00:48:46.215,00:48:47.924,How can you have me like this?
00:48:49.802,00:48:51.928,I will have you any way I can.
00:48:55.266,00:48:56.434,Always.
00:49:25.463,00:49:26.464,Get on with it.
00:50:01.290,00:50:03.250,"WILLIE: I'll miss you, mistress."
00:50:14.637,00:50:15.680,You're a true friend.
00:50:17.139,00:50:20.392,I doubt everyone is as sad as you are to see us go.
00:50:20.434,00:50:26.524,"It's nothing personal, mistress, but keeping you and Jamie out of harm's way proves to be a full-time occupation."
00:50:26.565,00:50:27.566,That's very true.
00:50:32.363,00:50:33.739,ANGUS: Mistress Claire?
00:50:36.367,00:50:40.120,May I kiss you farewell?
00:50:40.997,00:50:42.038,"No, you may not."
00:50:45.877,00:50:47.085,That is far too final.
00:50:48.629,00:50:49.881,You may kiss me au revoir.
00:50:54.010,00:50:55.219,"MURTAGH: Hey, hey."
00:50:56.387,00:50:57.388,I'm so sorry.
00:50:57.429,00:50:59.139,Seriously?
00:50:59.181,00:51:01.976,"Apologies, mistress, I lost my head."
00:51:11.986,00:51:14.488,"Goodbye to you, Claire. God bless."
00:51:15.740,00:51:17.992,Very gallant.
00:51:18.034,00:51:21.119,"See, that's how you take your leave of a lady."
00:51:21.161,00:51:23.664,"All right. Piss off, the lot of you."
00:51:29.503,00:51:35.091,"ANGUS: If ye happen to run into the rightful King across the water, you tell him Angus Mohr sends his best, eh?"
00:51:37.261,00:51:40.765,"King James is in Italy, ye fool, not France."
00:51:42.683,00:51:44.769,I meant if he...
00:51:44.810,00:51:45.770,"RUPERT: Yer arse, ye did."
00:52:24.934,00:52:31.774,"I thought I'd be the one to be puking my guts out over the side and here ye are, as green as rotten fish."
00:52:31.816,00:52:33.776,Please.
00:52:33.818,00:52:35.861,Fish is the last thing I want to think about right now.
00:52:46.538,00:52:47.456,Should I get a bucket?
00:52:50.459,00:52:53.129,Glad to see you're regaining your sense of humor.
00:53:01.762,00:53:03.179,"It'll be all right, won't it?"
00:53:04.515,00:53:05.975,"I mean, we'll be all right?"
00:53:08.769,00:53:10.021,I'll see to it.
00:53:14.900,00:53:18.696,We're headed into an unknown future and I...
00:53:18.737,00:53:19.738,Aye.
00:53:20.572,00:53:21.740,I know what you mean.
00:53:22.783,00:53:24.242,What are we to do in France?
00:53:30.206,00:53:31.876,"It won't be forever, Claire."
00:53:33.085,00:53:34.837,"Someday, we'll return to Scotland."
00:53:35.796,00:53:37.048,That I promise ye.
00:53:40.425,00:53:42.386,But you know what's going to happen in Scotland.
00:53:44.722,00:53:46.098,The Rising.
00:53:49.852,00:53:51.145,The end of the Highland culture.
00:53:52.646,00:53:54.398,What can we do but play our part?
00:54:08.913,00:54:11.289,"The Rising, Culloden, what if we could stop all of it?"
00:54:13.584,00:54:14.543,Change the future?
00:54:15.711,00:54:16.754,The two of us?
00:54:17.713,00:54:19.255,"That's madness, is it not?"
00:54:23.427,00:54:25.512,The Rising starts with Prince Charles.
00:54:27.181,00:54:30.350,"And right now, the Bonnie Prince is in France."
00:54:30.392,00:54:35.064,"I believe we can do anything we want, just as long as we're together."
00:54:56.961,00:54:59.171,There's something else.
00:54:59.213,00:55:01.924,Ye mean besides changing the future?
00:55:01.966,00:55:03.550,I'm not sure I'm ready to hear it.
00:55:06.553,00:55:08.388,I've been wondering how to tell you this.
00:55:13.518,00:55:19.066,Murtagh assures me that once we're underway you'll be too seasick to have a conversation.
00:55:33.538,00:55:37.626,"But, you said you were unable to..."
00:55:37.668,00:55:39.044,"Apparently, I was wrong."
00:55:49.638,00:55:50.681,Are you happy?
00:55:59.523,00:56:06.530,"I never thought I'd be able to say such a thing again, but yes."
00:56:07.906,00:56:08.949,Yes!
00:56:10.117,00:56:13.369,"I'm verra happy indeed, Sassenach!"
00:00:02.419,00:00:03.504,HORROCKS: It's the watch.
00:00:05.046,00:00:06.423,"Otherwise, they'll steal them themselves."
00:00:06.465,00:00:07.716,Where's Jamie?
00:00:07.758,00:00:10.761,The watch would turn him over in a minute if they thought there was profit involved.
00:00:10.803,00:00:14.181,There's a chance to get the price lifted from my head.
00:00:14.222,00:00:16.141,There's a witness who can prove my innocence.
00:00:16.183,00:00:17.267,A Redcoat deserter.
00:00:17.309,00:00:19.227,Horrocks?
00:00:19.269,00:00:22.189,The man who shot the Sergeant was Captain Jonathan Randall himself.
00:00:22.230,00:00:24.358,I canna use Randall's name to clear my own.
00:00:27.068,00:00:30.948,JENNY: Word filtered out that the Laird of Lallybroch had returned with his new bride.
00:00:33.450,00:00:35.327,"No, I wouldn't dream of putting you out of your room."
00:00:35.369,00:00:37.412,"Seeing as it's the Laird's room, after all."
00:00:42.793,00:00:45.754,Or this lovely lass is gonna be scrubbing yer brains off the floor.
00:02:23.143,00:02:25.104,I hope you kept yer powder dry.
00:02:26.521,00:02:32.319,"Misfire, and I'll ram that pistol down yer gullet."
00:02:37.992,00:02:39.367,"Well, there's only one way to find out."
00:02:50.796,00:02:53.507,"I've found a scoundrel in here, Jenny."
00:02:53.548,00:02:57.803,"He's lucky I've got a steady hand, or he'd have a ball in his brain by now."
00:02:57.845,00:03:00.639,"That's no scoundrel, you fool. That's my cousin."
00:03:00.681,00:03:01.807,Jamie.
00:03:04.392,00:03:05.268,Jamie MacTavish.
00:03:06.145,00:03:07.521,"Cousin, you say?"
00:03:18.866,00:03:20.034,My pardon to you.
00:03:21.535,00:03:23.286,You'll understand my caution.
00:03:25.873,00:03:27.791,Jamie came for a visit.
00:03:27.833,00:03:31.210,"Walked in one fine day without warning, and with a wife on his arm."
00:03:32.546,00:03:34.548,Jenny and Ian didn't know we were married.
00:03:35.716,00:03:36.675,We surprised them.
00:03:36.717,00:03:37.968,A Sassenach?
00:03:38.677,00:03:40.637,For a bride?
00:03:40.679,00:03:43.891,Nearly put a gun to his head myself when I heard.
00:03:46.518,00:03:48.729,We don't mind her English-ness so much.
00:03:59.447,00:04:00.657,I'm Taran MacQuarrie.
00:04:01.950,00:04:04.119,You'll excuse my confusion.
00:04:04.161,00:04:07.164,I thought yer husband was intending to rob the place.
00:04:07.206,00:04:10.250,we like to leave the robbing to you.
00:04:16.464,00:04:19.426,MacQuarrie.
00:04:19.467,00:04:20.844,"MACQUARRIE: Aye, that was the plan."
00:04:20.886,00:04:23.097,But I was pining for Jenny's rabbit stew.
00:04:24.389,00:04:25.515,Uh...
00:04:25.557,00:04:27.517,I took that sword of yours to the smithy.
00:04:28.685,00:04:33.523,"Had the nicks ground off the blade, and polished off the rust with a bit of whale oil."
00:04:33.565,00:04:35.150,You needn't have troubled yerself.
00:04:35.817,00:04:36.777,It was no trouble.
00:04:42.074,00:04:43.867,Looks better than new.
00:04:49.748,00:04:50.832,You're welcome.
00:04:55.045,00:04:58.590,"So, my stomach's rumbling like thunder."
00:04:58.632,00:05:02.052,"Jenny, how about you put some supper on the fire?"
00:05:02.094,00:05:04.012,"You know yer way to the dining room, lads."
00:05:04.054,00:05:05.472,MACQUARRIE: I do indeed.
00:05:14.481,00:05:16.858,MacQuarrie's come.
00:05:18.318,00:05:20.237,"Are you daft, sister?"
00:05:20.279,00:05:22.614,Welcoming the watch into our home.
00:05:22.656,00:05:24.574,"It's not like we had a choice, now, is it?"
00:05:24.616,00:05:26.367,IAN: It's only for a couple of days.
00:05:26.409,00:05:28.203,MacQuarrie's a decent fellow.
00:05:28.245,00:05:29.830,And you fixed his sword for him.
00:05:29.871,00:05:32.249,Maybe you'd like to polish his boots as well.
00:05:32.291,00:05:35.169,"I did the man a favor, that's all."
00:05:35.210,00:05:37.838,"They're criminals, out to line their own pockets."
00:05:37.879,00:05:43.135,IAN: The money we pay is for protection from the Redcoats and other raiding clans.
00:05:43.177,00:05:45.887,"They look out for us, Jamie, and our tenants."
00:05:45.929,00:05:48.056,And what about the price on my head?
00:05:48.098,00:05:50.642,"If the watch knew, they'd turn me over to the Redcoats in a heartbeat."
00:05:59.651,00:06:01.653,How often do these men come around?
00:06:01.695,00:06:04.323,Every few months for nigh on two years now.
00:06:05.866,00:06:08.910,"But you weren't here, now, were you, Jamie MacTavish?"
00:06:08.952,00:06:11.496,Keep your voices down.
00:06:27.554,00:06:28.471,Jamie.
00:06:30.515,00:06:33.768,You think it hasn't taken its toll on Jenny and me?
00:06:40.567,00:06:42.652,"If you've got a better idea, let's hear it."
00:06:49.576,00:06:50.535,Jenny?
00:06:53.038,00:06:55.582,"Breathe, relax."
00:06:57.251,00:06:59.086,Is it the bairn?
00:06:59.127,00:07:00.837,Kicks like a mule on fire.
00:07:04.258,00:07:05.884,CLAIRE: Just listen to your sister.
00:07:05.926,00:07:08.053,Tread lightly and don't provoke them.
00:07:19.106,00:07:21.149,"Oh, burns like a torch going down, aye?"
00:07:21.191,00:07:22.901,As long as it wets my thrapple.
00:07:22.943,00:07:27.697,"Aye, Jenny hides the good stuff away when we come, along with Ian's fine tobacco."
00:07:27.739,00:07:28.990,Do you blame me?
00:07:34.746,00:07:35.747,MACQUARRIE: You're a quiet one.
00:07:39.000,00:07:40.377,Na h-Innse Gall.
00:07:40.419,00:07:43.004,"Aye, you don't sound like an islander."
00:07:43.046,00:07:47.508,"Well, Jamie spent time in France fighting with the French army with Ian."
00:07:47.550,00:07:49.886,Perhaps that's what's influenced his accent.
00:07:51.596,00:07:54.474,I did some soldiering myself with the French in Austria.
00:07:57.518,00:07:58.478,Aye.
00:07:59.938,00:08:01.731,"Aye, the border mostly."
00:08:01.773,00:08:04.318,We got separated during a battle.
00:08:04.359,00:08:05.819,I thought he'd died on the field.
00:08:06.778,00:08:08.155,Hmm.
00:08:08.196,00:08:11.199,That was Silesia in '40.
00:08:12.909,00:08:16.371,He spent the next three weeks convalescing in a brothel.
00:08:18.415,00:08:21.251,In a hospital.
00:08:22.836,00:08:26.881,"Now, I was in Silesia in '42 when they stormed Prague."
00:08:26.923,00:08:30.051,We took that fortress before Francis Stephen knew what hit him.
00:08:34.931,00:08:36.141,Never be taken alive.
00:08:37.058,00:08:39.311,How daring.
00:08:39.353,00:08:45.150,There's nothing like charging into the guns after that first volley before the enemies get a chance to reload.
00:08:45.192,00:08:46.818,Aye.
00:08:46.860,00:08:49.070,And a sword to the head puts a good end to the second.
00:08:53.492,00:08:54.826,So you're an old colleague.
00:08:57.037,00:08:58.121,Curious.
00:09:10.384,00:09:11.634,I'm sure I must have.
00:09:11.676,00:09:12.552,No.
00:09:13.387,00:09:14.554,I'm sure you didn't.
00:09:23.604,00:09:35.033,"Here's to a long life and a merry one, a quick death and an easy one, a pretty girl and an honest one, a stiff whiskey and another one."
00:09:35.075,00:09:36.368,Aye.
00:09:45.168,00:09:46.586,How long are you staying?
00:09:47.421,00:09:48.463,A few days.
00:09:53.634,00:09:55.595,I have a few more men arriving tomorrow.
00:09:56.637,00:09:58.139,We are planning something big.
00:10:01.101,00:10:02.977,I'll tell you about it afterward if you're interested.
00:10:06.647,00:10:09.150,"In the meantime, one of my horses has turned up lame."
00:10:09.192,00:10:10.569,Needs shoeing.
00:10:10.610,00:10:12.487,I'll need to see the smithy in the morning.
00:10:12.529,00:10:14.614,I'll take a look at him for you.
00:10:14.655,00:10:16.616,I'm good with horses.
00:10:16.657,00:10:19.077,And we wouldn't want anything to keep you from yer travels.
00:10:20.828,00:10:21.955,I'll take you up on yer offer.
00:10:23.664,00:10:25.375,Our compliments to the cook.
00:10:25.417,00:10:28.962,"But if I take another bite, I'll be sleeping in the mud pen with the swine."
00:10:30.671,00:10:34.008,"There are extra blankets for you in the south cottage, and fresh hay."
00:11:03.871,00:11:06.207,I see you helped yerself to Ian's tobacco.
00:11:06.249,00:11:07.834,Fine tobacco it is.
00:11:09.586,00:11:11.338,Too fine for the likes of you.
00:11:13.214,00:11:14.799,"JAMIE: Yeah, shh."
00:11:14.841,00:11:17.594,"Rabbie, pass me the pincers, a bhalaich."
00:11:26.727,00:11:27.812,An abscess.
00:11:29.314,00:11:31.191,No wonder he turned up lame.
00:11:32.691,00:11:34.110,Just get it mended.
00:11:45.330,00:11:46.747,Fire!
00:11:53.004,00:11:54.713,Fire!
00:11:59.344,00:12:00.679,I'll pish on it for you.
00:12:01.762,00:12:03.014,LENNOX: Fire!
00:12:04.432,00:12:05.724,Fire!
00:12:08.228,00:12:09.479,LENNOX: Fire!
00:12:21.241,00:12:26.204,"This family's taken you in, given you food, shelter."
00:12:26.246,00:12:28.289,You might want to show some gratitude.
00:12:28.331,00:12:31.918,And you might want to remember who has the pistol here.
00:13:10.039,00:13:11.082,MACQUARRIE: Stand down!
00:13:13.668,00:13:14.793,All of you.
00:13:16.463,00:13:17.880,"Go on, get out of here."
00:13:25.138,00:13:28.057,They're good lads.
00:13:28.099,00:13:30.477,"And they dinna have the army like we did, aye."
00:13:31.519,00:13:33.104,I'm trying to school them.
00:13:38.025,00:13:40.779,"You know, I could use a man like you."
00:13:40.819,00:13:43.822,"Not just a bonnie fighter, a warrior."
00:13:54.833,00:13:56.294,I've done enough fighting in my life.
00:14:00.465,00:14:01.758,You let me know if you change yer mind.
00:14:04.344,00:14:06.680,Bhrain! Lucais!
00:14:41.172,00:14:42.298,You two lads know each other?
00:14:52.433,00:14:54.686,I thought so.
00:14:54.728,00:14:57.104,But you tom-faced Scots all look the same to me.
00:15:03.194,00:15:04.696,MACQUARRIE: Let's get a drink.
00:15:07.490,00:15:09.617,CLAIRE: But he knows there's a price on your head.
00:15:12.245,00:15:13.913,Traitor to the British.
00:15:18.877,00:15:20.294,He won't stay quiet for long.
00:15:24.424,00:15:26.384,Why would he stay quiet at all?
00:15:26.426,00:15:27.968,Surely there must be something he wants.
00:15:29.721,00:15:32.306,Lallybroch was the one place I thought we'd be safe.
00:15:34.975,00:15:36.394,I should never have come home.
00:15:36.436,00:15:37.937,Don't say that.
00:15:39.272,00:15:41.733,"Whatever happens, we'll handle it."
00:15:44.569,00:15:45.945,No matter the cost.
00:15:50.950,00:15:58.416,"The Chisholm land borders the Fraser's land to the west, and the Chisholm rent party will be traveling through this pass tomorrow."
00:15:58.458,00:16:00.293,Our best shot's Lochaber Bridge.
00:16:01.085,00:16:02.378,A day's ride.
00:16:02.420,00:16:06.006,We take them just after they cross under the bridge.
00:16:08.092,00:16:09.803,"And they'll be flush, you say?"
00:16:09.844,00:16:11.345,Aye.
00:16:11.387,00:16:13.973,Their sacks will be the fullest with coin and goods.
00:16:16.810,00:16:18.519,"After this, we've got the mending."
00:16:18.561,00:16:19.938,You any good with a needle?
00:16:19.979,00:16:23.650,"Well, I've stitched more wounds than clothes, but I'll give it a whirl."
00:16:27.528,00:16:29.155,"Jamie, have you no sense?"
00:16:29.196,00:16:30.907,Look what you've done to your auntie's skirt.
00:16:30.949,00:16:32.492,It's all right.
00:16:32.533,00:16:34.535,"Well, I mind. Mrs. Crook."
00:16:34.577,00:16:36.996,I'll take him back to the house for a bit of bread and honey.
00:16:42.627,00:16:46.255,Be nice to get some chores done without a bairn under my feet.
00:16:50.259,00:16:54.347,But soon he'll have a wee brother to play with.
00:16:54.388,00:16:56.349,How do you know it's not a sister?
00:16:56.390,00:17:02.689,"Well, I've had no morning sickness and a taste for salty food, and I'm carrying low, same as Wee Jamie."
00:17:03.690,00:17:04.941,"It's a boy, all right."
00:17:06.359,00:17:07.360,You have siblings?
00:17:16.577,00:17:20.540,Jamie was only eight when we lost Willie to smallpox.
00:17:20.581,00:17:22.667,He said Ian's been like a brother to him.
00:17:24.502,00:17:28.255,"The two of them were like one after Willie died, especially in a fight."
00:17:28.297,00:17:33.052,"Old John, Ian's father, used to tell Ian his job was to guard his chief's weaker side."
00:17:33.511,00:17:34.888,And he did.
00:17:42.979,00:17:44.063,Jenny.
00:17:44.898,00:17:46.065,What's wrong?
00:17:47.942,00:17:49.527,My waters have broken.
00:17:51.821,00:17:53.031,Looks like this laddie's on his way.
00:17:53.072,00:17:54.782,All right.
00:18:13.551,00:18:17.055,"Jenny, it feels to me that this baby is breech."
00:18:21.809,00:18:23.686,He's in the wrong position.
00:18:23.728,00:18:26.981,"The head should be down here, but it's still up here."
00:18:27.023,00:18:28.107,"He's a footling, then?"
00:18:32.737,00:18:35.197,We're going to have to turn him.
00:18:44.164,00:18:46.208,"You know about babies and such, then?"
00:18:46.250,00:18:47.501,I've seen childbirth.
00:19:08.522,00:19:10.399,"You've not yet been with child yourself, then?"
00:19:13.027,00:19:21.077,Grannie MacNab says ye should drink a tea of raspberry leaves and rosehips when the moon is waxing.
00:19:23.663,00:19:25.957,That and a bit of lady's mantle with a raw egg beaten up in it.
00:19:42.807,00:19:44.183,"It's not working, is it?"
00:19:47.269,00:19:48.312,"No, it isn't."
00:19:49.647,00:19:52.066,He's determined to land on his feet.
00:19:52.108,00:19:53.818,He's a stubborn one.
00:19:53.860,00:19:55.194,Definitely has Fraser in him.
00:20:03.119,00:20:05.038,We should go get Ian.
00:20:05.079,00:20:06.413,He should know what's going on.
00:20:08.624,00:20:10.168,No point in worrying the man.
00:20:14.630,00:20:17.216,"Tell him the bairn's coming, nothing else."
00:20:40.239,00:20:41.657,Making yerself comfortable?
00:20:43.159,00:20:44.911,I was wondering when you'd seek me out.
00:20:47.329,00:20:49.207,We have a lot to talk about.
00:20:49.248,00:20:50.374,Then let's talk.
00:20:52.543,00:20:56.255,"This, this is all yours."
00:21:03.554,00:21:06.265,"Yeah, I saw the name Fraser carved in the lintel."
00:21:09.060,00:21:10.269,Who's Jenny to you?
00:21:13.606,00:21:15.524,Very well. Don't tell me.
00:21:18.318,00:21:19.486,She's bonny.
00:21:23.824,00:21:25.284,So's your bride.
00:21:30.706,00:21:34.919,"But you, Jamie Fraser, you're the lucky man."
00:21:34.961,00:21:36.420,"What do you want, Horrocks?"
00:21:38.923,00:21:40.299,To sail to the colonies.
00:21:44.011,00:21:47.223,Then go.
00:21:49.225,00:21:51.060,I'm gonna need money for my venture.
00:21:53.437,00:21:57.316,You'll have plenty in your pockets after the raid on the rent party.
00:21:57.357,00:22:01.361,"It's a start, but not much of one, not after I divvy the pot with the others."
00:22:05.324,00:22:08.244,maybe you'd be willing to help a fellow.
00:22:08.286,00:22:11.789,Same way as I'm helping you by keeping my mouth shut.
00:22:11.831,00:22:14.250,"For a price, I'm sure."
00:22:15.626,00:22:19.630,"But you put up some money now, and I swear, you'll not see my face again."
00:22:28.806,00:22:29.932,How much?
00:22:36.814,00:22:38.398,He's dropped now.
00:22:40.818,00:22:43.112,All right.
00:22:46.782,00:22:49.160,"Tell me what it's like, being pregnant."
00:22:51.745,00:22:53.998,"Well, it's no romp in the heather."
00:22:54.040,00:22:55.916,I know. Come on. Tell me.
00:23:03.049,00:23:04.300,"Well, uh..."
00:23:06.760,00:23:10.973,"In the early days, it's just a bit like wind in yer belly."
00:23:12.141,00:23:15.269,"Later, you start to feel the child move."
00:23:15.311,00:23:22.985,"And it's like a fish on a line, just a quick tug, and then gone so soon, you're not sure you felt it."
00:23:25.363,00:23:27.823,They sleep for hours at a time.
00:23:29.950,00:23:33.954,"Sometimes when there's been no movement, you fear they've died."
00:23:33.996,00:23:38.125,"And then you try to wake them, and when they kick again..."
00:23:41.670,00:23:46.424,You get down on yer knees and promise God anything he asks if he'll just keep them safe.
00:23:47.676,00:23:48.677,Ooh.
00:23:55.517,00:23:56.560,Just breathe.
00:24:00.647,00:24:05.569,"And towards the end, when the child moves a lot."
00:24:08.322,00:24:11.449,It's a feeling like when yer man's inside you.
00:24:24.297,00:24:28.426,"Feels like that, only much bigger, like..."
00:24:29.718,00:24:32.221,Like it's him you've taken into you instead.
00:24:37.601,00:24:39.812,"That's what they want sometimes, you know."
00:24:41.439,00:24:43.065,They want to come back.
00:24:59.873,00:25:02.626,The midwife was called away to tend to a relative who's taken ill.
00:25:20.186,00:25:22.896,It is possible to deliver a breech baby.
00:25:22.938,00:25:25.232,I'm going to have to reach inside and guide it out.
00:25:29.445,00:25:32.865,"All right, but you'll be fetching me a good stiff dram before we start."
00:25:32.906,00:25:34.658,"In that case, the baby will likely be drunk, too."
00:25:34.700,00:25:36.952,Then he'll come into the world a true Scot.
00:25:38.704,00:25:39.621,All right.
00:25:45.919,00:25:50.132,"Ever since they got here, you have the look on your face like you've got a thistle stuck up your arse."
00:25:51.549,00:25:53.551,They burned hay we need for winter.
00:25:55.846,00:25:57.931,You'd have me turn the other cheek?
00:25:57.973,00:26:00.642,"That's why you've got two cheeks, you limmer."
00:26:06.315,00:26:08.734,Jenny hates the very bones of them.
00:26:08.775,00:26:10.319,I canna understand why you don't.
00:26:15.866,00:26:17.826,Just ask the MacIntoshes.
00:26:17.868,00:26:19.245,He's been easy on us.
00:26:21.579,00:26:23.290,So you're boon companions with him.
00:26:23.332,00:26:25.000,"Aye, so I am."
00:26:26.544,00:26:31.131,"And if you want to ken the truth of it, I look forward to his visits."
00:26:31.173,00:26:37.221,"To drink whiskey with a man who doesna look on me with pity, as if I'm some lame cur."
00:26:37.263,00:26:40.598,Maybe I favor him because he's a soldier or because...
00:26:50.650,00:26:54.071,And because he protects us from the Redcoats.
00:26:54.113,00:26:57.450,"He pays them to stay away, and when they don't, he fights them."
00:26:58.867,00:27:00.702,You pay one devil to protect you from another.
00:27:00.744,00:27:02.662,"I'm not proud of it, but there it is."
00:27:07.918,00:27:11.171,What happened here with Jenny never will again.
00:27:12.798,00:27:15.551,But no man can stand up to that monster Randall alone.
00:27:15.593,00:27:18.011,"Not you, not me."
00:27:19.346,00:27:21.140,The watch is our army now.
00:27:27.187,00:27:28.646,What's the matter?
00:27:34.361,00:27:39.617,"That new man, Horrocks."
00:27:39.657,00:27:41.619,He knows about the price on my head.
00:27:41.659,00:27:44.246,He wants money to keep quiet.
00:27:44.288,00:27:45.456,What are you going to do?
00:27:49.084,00:27:50.461,I dinna ken.
00:27:52.670,00:27:55.174,Jenny told me about a small sum your father left.
00:27:55.215,00:27:56.967,It's ferreted away in a nook in the broch.
00:27:57.009,00:27:58.177,I canna use that money.
00:27:58.218,00:28:00.220,Half of it's yours by right.
00:28:00.262,00:28:02.889,If Jenny knew about this...
00:28:05.434,00:28:06.768,And I want it kept that way.
00:28:08.437,00:28:11.148,I won't be taking that money.
00:28:12.732,00:28:14.527,It's what she would want.
00:28:14.568,00:28:16.320,It's what I want.
00:28:18.614,00:28:21.699,"That money was meant for you, for our sons and daughters."
00:28:23.076,00:28:27.498,"I wanted to fill this house with our children, hand down the good Fraser name."
00:28:30.083,00:28:31.335,"I've let you down, Claire."
00:28:48.185,00:28:49.853,It's me that's let you down.
00:28:58.529,00:29:02.575,"The truth is, I may never give you a son as beautiful as little Jamie."
00:29:20.300,00:29:21.427,With Frank.
00:29:29.309,00:29:39.528,"before we were married, but I never counted on loving you, much less having children with you."
00:29:50.456,00:29:51.707,I'm so sorry.
00:30:02.926,00:30:04.553,Perhaps it's for the best.
00:30:11.184,00:30:12.852,There's...
00:30:16.064,00:30:17.941,I wouldn't want anything to happen to you.
00:30:19.067,00:30:20.778,Or for you to suffer.
00:30:23.447,00:30:24.615,I wouldn't mind the pain.
00:30:24.657,00:30:25.741,I would.
00:30:26.659,00:30:31.664,"I can bear pain myself, but I couldna bear yours."
00:30:35.626,00:30:37.836,That would take more strength than I have.
00:30:48.888,00:30:50.557,I shouldna keep you from Jenny.
00:30:56.146,00:30:57.564,Don't worry.
00:31:00.484,00:31:01.777,I'll make sure of it.
00:31:52.285,00:31:53.912,Oh. Ho-ho.
00:31:54.830,00:31:55.914,I must thank you.
00:31:57.123,00:31:58.250,You've been generous.
00:31:59.710,00:32:02.337,Then we're done here.
00:32:02.379,00:32:03.922,There's just one small concern.
00:32:06.049,00:32:07.300,I thought there might be.
00:32:07.342,00:32:10.721,This is enough for safe passage to the colonies.
00:32:10.763,00:32:13.682,But then there's the matter of making a living when I'm there.
00:32:19.145,00:32:20.439,That's everything I have.
00:32:22.482,00:32:25.026,But you're the Laird.
00:32:25.068,00:32:27.529,"Surely you can raise the rents of your tenants, huh?"
00:32:27.571,00:32:30.240,Sell off livestock or land?
00:32:30.282,00:32:31.491,This is clan land.
00:32:33.076,00:32:35.036,It's belonged to my family for hundreds of years.
00:32:35.078,00:32:36.747,"More's the pity if you lost it, then."
00:32:39.708,00:32:41.960,You must be deep in the drink to say such a thing.
00:32:45.338,00:32:46.799,Ah...
00:32:46.840,00:32:49.217,An Irishman's never drunk.
00:32:49.259,00:32:54.389,"As long as he can hold on to one blade of grass, he'll not fall off the face of the earth."
00:32:55.307,00:32:58.727,"I do partake from time to time, and my tongue gets loose."
00:32:59.770,00:33:02.397,Who knows what I might say?
00:33:02.439,00:33:04.775,"I'm a danger to myself, and others."
00:33:06.735,00:33:07.986,Like your kith and kin.
00:33:08.987,00:33:10.447,You leave my kin out of this.
00:33:13.283,00:33:16.244,The British Army don't take kindly to those who harbor outlaws.
00:33:21.792,00:33:23.376,I'm sure you'd agree.
00:33:53.657,00:33:56.242,I thought I killed my last man in the war.
00:34:04.668,00:34:08.839,"Although if you hadn't done it, I would've done it myself."
00:34:08.881,00:34:12.300,"The man was an absconder, a traitor and a thief."
00:34:12.342,00:34:16.346,"He wasna worthy of the watch, nor even a Redcoat."
00:34:16.388,00:34:19.016,"Let's bury the bastard, which is more than he deserves."
00:34:26.773,00:34:28.608,Wipe the blood off first.
00:34:29.484,00:34:30.610,Ian.
00:34:52.424,00:35:05.144,"Remember, we used to argue which was the bigger sin, fornication or killing."
00:35:11.234,00:35:13.278,And worry whether we would go to hell.
00:35:23.329,00:35:27.125,"Well, if you're going to hell, I might as well go, too."
00:35:30.336,00:35:32.547,God knows you'll never manage alone.
00:35:37.135,00:35:39.054,Go get the shovel.
00:35:57.280,00:35:59.198,Take this.
00:35:59.240,00:36:01.743,My fingers are swelling up like sausages.
00:36:02.786,00:36:04.245,You can put it in the jewelry box.
00:36:04.287,00:36:06.999,I keep it hidden in the drawer when the watch is around.
00:36:27.644,00:36:31.356,Our brother Willie carved that for Jamie for his fifth birthday.
00:36:31.397,00:36:33.859,I found it recently.
00:36:36.444,00:36:37.278,Sawny.
00:36:38.905,00:36:40.657,It's a pet name.
00:36:40.699,00:36:43.660,"It's a play on the Gaelic for his second name, Alexander."
00:36:43.702,00:36:45.704,It's what Willie used to call Jamie.
00:36:48.665,00:36:50.667,I know he'd want him to have it.
00:37:01.260,00:37:05.765,"Willie's buried out there, next to my mother."
00:37:09.144,00:37:13.857,"She died two years after he did, in childbirth."
00:37:23.742,00:37:25.243,to Jamie for me.
00:37:28.747,00:37:30.165,You give it to him yourself.
00:37:44.262,00:37:46.514,"Woman, quit yer screeching!"
00:37:50.685,00:37:53.605,Yer wife's howling like she's giving birth to a harpsichord.
00:37:57.609,00:37:58.484,"Oh, ho!"
00:38:08.703,00:38:12.665,I think we've used a bit more of your hay than usual.
00:38:12.707,00:38:15.585,"Buy some extra, in case you run short in the winter."
00:38:25.011,00:38:27.346,"You know, we haven't seen Horrocks since supper."
00:38:27.388,00:38:28.347,No.
00:38:29.849,00:38:31.309,Neither have I.
00:38:35.147,00:38:36.940,Ah! He'll turn up.
00:38:37.774,00:38:38.942,Irish pogue.
00:38:41.778,00:38:43.071,He'd better.
00:38:46.950,00:38:48.534,'Cause we leave for Lochaber tomorrow.
00:38:48.576,00:38:49.995,Ah!
00:38:50.036,00:38:51.121,"Hey, lads."
00:38:52.038,00:38:53.331,"Tomorrow, aye."
00:39:06.636,00:39:07.971,How's Jenny?
00:39:08.013,00:39:10.431,IAN: The babbie's taking its own sweet time.
00:39:15.478,00:39:21.026,"Well, there's still no sign of our friend Mr. Horrocks, which is a wee bit of a puzzle."
00:39:22.485,00:39:23.611,It is a puzzle.
00:39:26.865,00:39:37.500,"Well, his horse is just outside, so he can't have gone far, given that the man would barely walk 10 steps to pish, much less wander away."
00:39:38.501,00:39:43.381,"Now, I have a fair knowledge of mathematics."
00:39:44.090,00:39:47.844,"Three men go out, two men come in."
00:39:52.974,00:40:08.073,"If I add to that the fact that you two knew each other and you hid it from me, that doesn't tally up."
00:40:16.373,00:40:17.415,I don't get yer meaning.
00:40:21.961,00:40:23.213,Why'd you kill him?
00:40:33.723,00:40:34.849,Let me explain.
00:40:44.859,00:40:46.403,There's a price on my head.
00:40:47.070,00:40:48.863,"Ten pounds, sterling."
00:40:50.823,00:40:52.450,Likely twice that now.
00:40:54.869,00:40:56.162,Horrocks knew it.
00:40:57.330,00:40:59.624,He threatened me and my family.
00:41:02.377,00:41:03.461,So...
00:41:09.008,00:41:10.509,I ran him through.
00:41:20.437,00:41:21.520,Good.
00:41:24.857,00:41:27.568,I never liked the Irish bastard.
00:41:27.610,00:41:29.821,"If ever a man needed killing, it was him."
00:41:38.163,00:41:42.208,"We're raiding the Chisholms today, and now I'm a man short."
00:41:44.336,00:41:52.260,"And I could do with a tall, strong Scotsman who's swift with a sword."
00:41:52.302,00:41:55.472,"So unless you're prepared to dig seven graves, including your own..."
00:42:12.322,00:42:13.656,I'll ride with you.
00:42:18.577,00:42:19.662,This once.
00:42:22.165,00:42:23.541,"I'm coming, too."
00:42:23.582,00:42:25.751,"If he wants to come, let him come."
00:42:25.793,00:42:27.628,He's got two hands.
00:42:30.507,00:42:31.966,I'll have you both.
00:42:34.593,00:42:36.137,Watch your back.
00:42:36.179,00:42:39.849,He could still turn you in for the reward after you've served his purpose.
00:42:39.891,00:42:42.560,"I don't think he will, but I'm going with him."
00:42:45.604,00:42:47.357,Jenny needs her husband here with her.
00:42:47.399,00:42:49.275,What I need is my brother home safe.
00:42:49.317,00:42:51.319,I lost him once already.
00:42:51.361,00:42:53.530,"And Claire's here, so off with the both of you."
00:42:56.074,00:42:58.034,Your newborn son will be waiting to meet ye.
00:43:26.187,00:43:29.482,"Jenny found this, asked me to give it to you."
00:43:31.901,00:43:32.902,Sawny.
00:43:42.745,00:43:45.081,I haven't seen him for a long time.
00:43:56.259,00:43:58.303,You heard your sister.
00:43:58.344,00:44:00.430,"Haste ye back, or else."
00:44:04.183,00:44:05.393,Or else what?
00:44:07.270,00:44:17.696,"Or else I will follow you, I will drag you back by your thick, red curls, and you won't like it one bit."
00:44:19.115,00:44:21.826,"No, Sassenach."
00:44:24.412,00:44:25.997,I'm sure I wouldn't.
00:45:18.007,00:45:19.925,"Good being out on the road again, eh?"
00:45:19.967,00:45:21.553,In the pishing rain?
00:45:24.096,00:45:26.391,The road's a dangerous place to live.
00:45:27.225,00:45:28.809,Why do ye do it?
00:45:32.355,00:45:33.730,I'm a fighter.
00:45:35.274,00:45:37.109,And I'm good at it.
00:45:37.151,00:45:40.238,I grew tired of fighting for rich dukes and monarchs.
00:45:41.113,00:45:42.781,I realized the world is mine.
00:45:49.372,00:45:52.333,"Here, that's a souvenir from our last raid."
00:45:53.042,00:45:54.043,Open it.
00:45:58.423,00:46:07.932,Pale death visits with impartial foot the cottages of the poor and the castles of the rich.
00:46:14.606,00:46:16.649,These were made for Mary Stuart.
00:46:18.025,00:46:19.860,"Real barrel of laughs, that one."
00:46:22.029,00:46:25.116,"You know, I don't mind death as long as it comes under an open sky."
00:46:25.658,00:46:27.076,Myself as well.
00:46:28.620,00:46:30.955,"This doesn't have to end after today, ye ken."
00:46:32.123,00:46:37.295,"We could branch out, raid the royal tax wagons, English landowners."
00:46:39.297,00:46:42.883,"Prussia, Flanders, Saxony."
00:46:42.925,00:46:45.386,Make a name for ourselves.
00:46:47.346,00:46:49.890,"You paint a bonny picture, MacQuarrie."
00:46:49.932,00:46:53.185,"If it wasn't for Claire, maybe I'd take you up on it."
00:46:53.894,00:46:57.607,"We'll talk again later, when your blood's up and you've got gold in your pocket."
00:47:00.817,00:47:02.027,To the British?
00:47:05.114,00:47:07.241,Never.
00:47:07.283,00:47:09.201,I've seen the inside of a jail myself.
00:47:09.994,00:47:11.120,The Tolbooth.
00:47:12.079,00:47:13.498,I wouldn't wish it on a dog.
00:47:14.749,00:47:16.208,I'd shoot you first.
00:47:22.423,00:47:24.300,"Bridge, just up ahead."
00:47:43.528,00:47:46.238,Come on.
00:47:47.699,00:47:50.075,"Just do as I say, Claire."
00:47:50.117,00:47:51.744,"Listen, you will get through this."
00:47:54.831,00:47:56.957,"Ah! Damn you, Claire."
00:47:58.751,00:48:03.214,I can't do this.
00:48:03.255,00:48:05.132,"You've done it before, and you're going to do it again."
00:48:05.174,00:48:06.883,Get behind me.
00:48:07.760,00:48:09.345,Christ almighty.
00:48:10.971,00:48:12.264,"Oh, bloody hell."
00:48:15.560,00:48:16.644,"All right, he's coming."
00:48:17.269,00:48:18.270,He's coming.
00:48:24.610,00:48:26.738,"All right, here we go."
00:48:44.296,00:48:46.923,LENNOX: Hold up.
00:48:51.804,00:48:53.514,When are the Chisholms due to pass?
00:48:53.556,00:48:55.266,Just shy of sundown.
00:48:55.307,00:48:57.727,Horrocks said they're going to be coming from the east.
00:48:57.769,00:49:00.354,"LENNOX: I'll go up there and stop them, just as they're crossing the bridge."
00:49:00.396,00:49:01.480,CRENSHAW: Aye.
00:49:02.774,00:49:04.817,You can say what you like about Horrocks.
00:49:04.859,00:49:08.237,Scunner knew how to pick the perfect spot for an ambush.
00:49:08.279,00:49:10.030,Let's get in yer positions.
00:49:10.072,00:49:11.699,Horrocks was right.
00:49:11.741,00:49:14.159,With the high walls and the dense cover...
00:49:33.512,00:49:35.807,There's no way out.
00:49:35.848,00:49:37.015,Jamie!
00:49:38.225,00:49:39.226,Fire!
00:49:42.020,00:49:43.397,Fire!
00:49:50.655,00:49:51.948,MACQUARRIE: Fire!
00:50:11.467,00:50:13.218,Congratulations.
00:50:13.260,00:50:14.553,Hmm.
00:50:16.096,00:50:20.518,Your bonny little lass just landed on her feet.
00:50:23.521,00:50:25.397,"A lass, ye say?"
00:50:26.190,00:50:27.191,Crivvens.
00:51:18.743,00:51:23.121,"CLAIRE: Three days, and still no sign of Jamie or Ian."
00:51:24.582,00:51:30.254,"Every day I sat on the steps and stared at the road, as if I could will them to appear."
00:51:38.094,00:51:40.598,"She had us well fooled, didn't she?"
00:51:40.639,00:51:42.725,Little Margaret Ellen Murray.
00:51:44.643,00:51:46.102,She certainly did.
00:51:46.144,00:51:47.730,'Twas my grandmother's name.
00:51:51.483,00:51:52.860,It suits her.
00:51:54.820,00:52:02.411,"Wee Jamie may favor Ian, but this little one, she's got the Fraser eyes."
00:52:02.453,00:52:04.830,"Here, Mrs. Crook will put her down for a nap."
00:52:11.670,00:52:13.589,Mrs. Crook.
00:52:17.133,00:52:18.510,Shh.
00:52:28.604,00:52:31.607,You look good with a wee yin in yer arms.
00:52:31.649,00:52:33.525,You'll be holding yer own soon enough.
00:52:35.820,00:52:37.321,I don't know that I will.
00:52:40.032,00:52:42.660,"Listen to me, Claire Fraser."
00:52:42.701,00:52:46.122,"Every day for four years, I stared at that very road."
00:52:47.873,00:52:49.207,He will come home.
00:52:49.249,00:52:50.417,He always does.
00:52:59.093,00:53:02.054,These belonged to my mother.
00:53:04.015,00:53:06.391,"You're tall and queenly, like she was."
00:53:07.559,00:53:09.603,The lady of Lallybroch should have them.
00:53:16.777,00:53:18.194,They're gorgeous.
00:53:19.947,00:53:21.239,"Really, they are."
00:53:23.993,00:53:28.455,So very unique.
00:53:31.083,00:53:33.209,Someone gave them to her as a wedding gift.
00:53:33.251,00:53:35.420,She never would say who.
00:53:35.462,00:53:42.469,"My father used to tease her about her admirer, but she just smiled like a cat that's had cream for its supper."
00:54:28.473,00:54:30.726,"Ian, you're hurt."
00:54:30.768,00:54:32.436,IAN: I'm all right.
00:54:32.477,00:54:34.730,I lost my horse and my leg in the fight.
00:54:37.608,00:54:38.650,Where's Jamie?
00:54:40.194,00:54:42.905,We were ambushed.
00:54:42.947,00:54:44.907,The Redcoats were waiting.
00:54:44.949,00:54:46.700,Horrocks.
00:54:46.742,00:54:49.578,That dirty bastard must've cut a deal with them.
00:54:49.620,00:54:50.871,I don't understand.
00:54:50.913,00:54:53.791,Delivering the watch to buy his freedom.
00:54:53.832,00:54:55.542,The other lads were killed outright.
00:54:57.586,00:54:59.504,I fetched Murray home.
00:55:05.594,00:55:07.387,Where is Jamie?
00:55:07.429,00:55:10.057,MacQuarrie was wounded.
00:55:10.099,00:55:11.475,Jamie wouldn't leave him behind.
00:55:11.516,00:55:13.351,Was Jamie hurt?
00:55:13.393,00:55:15.562,Not that I saw.
00:55:17.022,00:55:18.690,But they took him.
00:55:21.317,00:55:23.154,The Redcoats have him.
