00:45:38.027,00:45:42.781,FRANK SAID SHE WAS WALKING ON HER OWN WHEN SHE GOT IN THE TRUCK FIVE HOURS AGO.
00:45:42.781,00:45:46.285,THE BITES KILLED HER.
00:45:46.285,00:45:47.412,HOW DO YOU KNOW?
00:45:47.412,00:45:48.538,I WATCHED IT HAPPEN.
00:45:48.538,00:45:50.498,"I FELT HER PULSE, SHE WAS GONE."
00:45:50.498,00:45:54.586,"THEN, YESTERDAY I SAW THE SAME THING HAPPEN TO SOMEBODY ELSE."
00:45:56.753,00:45:59.424,I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S SPREAD SO FAST.
00:46:02.009,00:46:03.302,ALL RIGHT.
00:46:05.888,00:46:08.725,"SO, WHO ELSE IN THE GROUP IS BITTEN?"
00:46:08.725,00:46:11.644,"- FRANK, FOR SURE."
00:46:11.644,00:46:14.813,TUCKER?
00:46:14.813,00:46:17.609,"SO, IT'S FRANK."
00:46:17.609,00:46:20.777,RIGHT. SO WE HAVE TO QUARANTINE HIM RIGHT AWAY.
00:46:20.777,00:46:22.614,WHERE EXACTLY DO WE DO THAT?
00:46:22.614,00:46:25.157,I DON'T KNOW.
00:46:25.157,00:46:27.285,THEN WHAT?
00:46:27.285,00:46:29.662,"I DON'T KNOW, BUT..."
00:46:29.662,00:46:32.998,IT'S TOO DANGEROUS TO KEEP HIM AROUND.
00:46:36.252,00:46:38.546,"I'M SORRY, WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE?"
00:46:38.546,00:46:40.797,ARE WE TALKING ABOUT KILLING HIM?
00:46:40.797,00:46:43.301,WOULD YOU RATHER WE WAITED FOR HIM TO DIE AND HE TRIES TO KILL US?
00:46:43.301,00:46:45.928,"- YES-- NO, YOU CAN'T KILL HIM."
00:46:45.928,00:46:48.013,- HE'S GOT A DAUGHTER!
00:46:49.682,00:46:52.059,I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY OTHER CHOICE.
00:46:54.520,00:46:56.648,HE'S RIGHT.
00:46:58.775,00:47:00.735,"MICHAEL, YOU CAN'T DO THIS."

00:47:06.324,00:47:07.492,FRANK?
00:47:08.701,00:47:10.827,MICHAEL'S COMING TO SHOOT YOU.
00:47:10.827,00:47:13.122,WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
00:47:13.122,00:47:17.543,YOU'RE INFECTED.
00:47:19.337,00:47:21.880,Frank: IS THIS TRUE?
00:47:21.880,00:47:24.133,ARE YOU GOING TO KILL ME?
00:47:24.133,00:47:26.636,YOU'VE BEEN BITTEN.
00:47:26.636,00:47:30.682,"NO, NO, NO."
00:47:30.682,00:47:32.308,Daughter: YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
00:47:33.685,00:47:36.688,YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE'S LOST EVERYONE.

00:47:52.662,00:47:54.747,"GO AHEAD, KILL HIM."
00:47:56.749,00:47:58.751,"HEY, KILL TUCKER, TOO."
00:47:58.751,00:48:00.795,"WAIT A MINUTE, I WAS NEVER BIT."
00:48:00.795,00:48:04.465,WE CAN'T BE SURE.
00:48:06.467,00:48:08.678,ARE YOU SURE IT'S THE BITE?
00:48:08.678,00:48:10.638,NO.

00:48:59.437,00:49:02.481,"ANDRE, I CAN'T HAVE BABY HERE."
00:49:02.481,00:49:05.067,WHY NOT?
00:49:02.481,00:49:09.238,"PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HAVING BABIES FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS, ALL ON THEIR OWN-- NO HOSPITALS."

01:07:22.079,01:07:23.957,JUST WAIT!
01:07:25.500,01:07:27.585,Ana: SHE DIED OF THE GUNSHOT.
01:07:27.585,01:07:29.838,SHE WASN'T BITTEN.
01:07:31.548,01:07:33.132,"SHE'S GONNA WAKE UP THOUGH, RIGHT?"
01:07:36.177,01:07:38.972,NO.
01:07:38.972,01:07:42.058,"NO, IF SHE WAS ONE OF THEM SHE'D BE UP BY NOW."
01:08:08.752,01:08:11.087,NO.
01:08:13.506,01:08:15.508,- TERRY?
01:08:15.508,01:08:17.260,HOLD THIS.
01:08:38.573,01:08:49.459,"Kenneth: BEEN TO A LOT OF FUNERALS, I'VE FOLDED THE FLAG AND GIVEN IT TO A LOT OF WIVES, FATHERS AND KIDS, AND I TOLD THEM HOW SORRY I WAS."
01:08:49.459,01:08:52.921,BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS REALLY FEELING.
01:08:52.921,01:08:59.094,"IN THE BACK OF MY MIND I WAS ALWAYS SAYING, BETTER THEM THAN ME."
01:08:59.094,01:09:01.888,BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT NOW.
01:09:01.888,01:09:08.979,BECAUSE NOW I REALIZE THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS WORSE THAN DEATH-- ONE OF THEM IS SITTING HERE WAITING TO DIE.
01:09:13.190,01:09:15.401,I DON'T WANT TO DIE HERE.
01:09:22.033,01:09:23.785,I SAW A COUPLE OF BUSES IN THE GARAGE.
01:09:23.785,01:09:28.665,"WE COULD FIX THEM UP, WE COULD REINFORCE THEM, AND THEN GET AS FAR FROM HERE AS POSSIBLE."
01:09:28.665,01:09:30.374,AND THEN WHAT?
01:09:30.374,01:09:33.003,I HAVE AN IDEA.
01:09:30.374,01:09:35.964,"WHILE WE'RE AT IT, WHY DON'T WE..."
01:09:33.003,01:09:40.635,"SWING BY THE MARINA, HOP IN MY BOAT AND TAKE IT FOR A PLEASURE CRUISE, YOU JACKASSES?"
01:09:40.635,01:09:42.637,"WAIT, A MINUTE, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA."
01:09:42.637,01:09:45.264,THERE'S ISLANDS ON THOSE LAKES-- NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THEM.
01:09:45.264,01:09:49.060,- I WAS KIDDING.
01:09:49.060,01:09:51.104,"OH, MY GOD."

01:09:57.819,01:09:59.946,KENNETH?
01:09:59.946,01:10:02.032,"YEAH, IT'S A GOOD IDEA."
01:10:02.032,01:10:04.450,"WE HAVE TO PICK UP ANDY, HE'S PART OF THE GROUP."
01:10:04.450,01:10:10.623,"EXCUSE ME-- NOT TO SHIT ON ANYONE'S RIFF HERE, BUT LET ME SEE IF I'VE GRASPED THIS CONCEPT, OKAY?"
01:10:10.623,01:10:35.314,"YOU'RE SUGGESTING WE TAKE SOME FUCKING PARKING SHUTTLES REINFORCE THEM WITH ALUMINUM SIDING, AND THEN HEAD OVER TO THE GUN STORE, WHERE WE WATCH OUR FRIEND ANDY PLAY SOME COWBOY MOVIE, JUMP-ON-THE-COVERED-WAGON BULLSHIT, THEN, WE'RE GONNA DRIVE ACROSS A RUINED CITY THROUGH A WELCOME COMMITTEE OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND DEAD CANNIBALS, SO THAT WE CAN SAIL OFF INTO THE SUNSET ON THIS FUCKING ASSHOLE'S BOAT-- FOR SOME ISLAND, THAT FOR ALL WE KNOW, DOESN'T EVEN EXIST?"
01:10:35.314,01:10:37.483,YEAH.
01:10:37.483,01:10:39.110,"PRETTY MUCH, YEAH."
01:10:42.321,01:10:44.991,YEAH.
01:10:47.160,01:10:48.912,OKAY.
01:10:50.914,01:10:52.665,I'M IN.
01:11:59.816,01:12:08.074,"WE HAVE 12 OF THESE SHOTGUN SHELLS, 26 OF THOSE PUSSY NINE-MILS, AND 16 OF THOSE 357 MAGNUMS."
01:12:08.074,01:12:11.077,ANA: YEAH? IT'S STILL NOT VERY MUCH.
01:12:11.077,01:12:14.705,HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET TO THE DOCK AND THERE WON'T BE TOO MANY OF THEM.
