00:00:51.677,00:00:54.638,FOR DISMISSAL.
00:00:54.680,00:00:57.349,UNLESS YOU HAVE A PASS FOR SPORTS OR SOMETHING.
00:01:00.519,00:01:02.855,AND IS THAT WHAT YOU DID ON THE DAY IN QUESTION?
00:01:02.897,00:01:06.984,NO. MR. GETTYS ASKED ME TO STAY AFTER CLASS.
00:01:07.026,00:01:09.028,"AND WHAT HAPPENED NEXT, BARBARA?"
00:01:09.069,00:01:11.947,HE TOLD ME TO SIT IN THE CHAIR BESIDE HIS DESK.
00:01:11.989,00:01:19.329,"BARBARA, IF YOU WILL, IN YOUR OWN WORDS, TELL US EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES."
00:01:19.371,00:01:21.498,I TOLD HIM I WAS AFRAID I'D MISS MY BUS.
00:01:21.540,00:01:25.920,HE PROMISED I'D GET TO THE BUS ON TIME IF I WOULD HELP HIM TO DO SOMETHING.
00:01:25.961,00:01:32.133,"THEN...BEFORE I COULD SAY ANYTHING, HE PUT--HE PLACED HIS HAND INSIDE MY BLOUSE."
00:01:32.175,00:01:33.969,"I WAS SO FRIGHTENED, I DIDN'T MOVE."
00:01:34.011,00:01:36.095,"I THOUGHT IF I WAS JUST QUIET, IT'D BE OK."
00:01:36.137,00:01:41.184,THEN HIS OTHER HAND WENT UP UNDER INSIDE MY SKIRT.
00:01:41.226,00:01:49.150,"AND THEN, WITH HIS HAND, HE STARTED MOVING BACK AND FORTH FARTHER AND FARTHER INSIDE MY SKIRT."
00:01:49.192,00:01:55.115,"HE SAID HE WAS TESTING TO SEE IF I HAD ANY SPECIAL FEELINGS, THAT HE WANTED TO SEE WHAT KIND OF FEELINGS I HAD."
00:01:55.156,00:02:00.913,"I WAS TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING TO SAY, BUT I COULDN'T, I WAS CONFUSED, AND HE JUST KEPT ON."
00:02:00.955,00:02:03.707,"I WAS ASKIN' HIM TO STOP, BUT IT WAS LIKE HE COULDN'T HEAR ME."
00:02:03.749,00:02:06.961,HE JUST KEPT ON WITH HIS HAND...
00:02:07.002,00:02:08.796,AND THEN I SCREAMED.
00:02:08.837,00:02:11.882,THEN HE GOT MAD AND SAID WE WOULD HAVE TO TRY IT AGAIN SOMETIME.
00:02:11.924,00:02:14.051,Lawyer: DID HE TRY AGAIN?
00:02:14.093,00:02:16.720,NOT WITH ME.
00:02:16.762,00:02:18.346,BUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS?
00:02:18.388,00:02:20.724,YES.
00:02:20.766,00:02:29.441,"AND AFTER YOU TOLD THEM WHAT HE HAD DONE TO YOU, THEY TOLD YOU WHAT HE HAD DONE TO THEM!"
00:02:31.443,00:02:32.569,ISN'T THAT TRUE?
00:02:32.611,00:02:34.488,YES.
00:02:37.282,00:02:38.867,I HAVE NOTHING FURTHER.
00:02:41.286,00:02:43.455,"YOUR WITNESS, MR. LOMAX."
00:02:51.630,00:02:53.757,"ANY CHANCE, YOUR HONOR, FOR A SHORT RECESS?"
00:02:53.799,00:02:58.137,OF COURSE. THIS COURT WILL BE IN RECESS FOR 15 MINUTES.
00:03:02.141,00:03:03.767,"HONEY, WHAT-- NOT NOW, DENISE."
00:03:09.982,00:03:11.942,LOMAX! WHAT'S WRONG?
00:03:11.984,00:03:15.070,"LLOYD, AS YOUR ATTORNEY, I'M ADVISING YOU TO KEEP THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME."
00:03:15.112,00:03:17.114,WHY? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
00:03:17.156,00:03:19.449,"THE WIFE, THE KID, THE OUTRAGE..."
00:03:19.491,00:03:20.826,YOU DEFINITELY HAD ME FOOLED.
00:03:20.868,00:03:23.328,HEY! YOU'RE MY LAWYER.

00:03:25.998,00:03:27.582,I'M THINKING WHY DON'T WE PUT YOU ON THE STAND?
00:03:27.624,00:03:28.709,YOU CAN JERK OFF FOR THE JUDGE.
00:03:28.750,00:03:29.877,YOU KNOW SHE'S LYING.
00:03:29.918,00:03:31.336,GET THE HELL AWAY FROM ME.
00:03:52.816,00:03:55.152,"WELL, HELL, THERE YOU ARE."
00:03:56.486,00:03:58.822,RUMOR WAS YOU WERE OUT WANDERING IN TRAFFIC.
00:03:58.864,00:04:00.908,"NOT NOW, LARRY."
00:04:00.949,00:04:02.492,"WHAT'S THE GAME PLAN, KEVIN?"
00:04:02.534,00:04:05.787,I GOT A 4:30 DEADLINE.

00:04:10.167,00:04:14.671,MR. LOMAX HAD NO COMMENT ON TODAY'S EVENTS.
00:04:14.713,00:04:25.891,"SPECULATION, HOWEVER, WAS WIDESPREAD THAT THE YOUNG LAWYER'S UNBLEMISHED STRING OF VICTORIES WOULD COME TO AN END IN THIS COURTROOM."
00:04:31.479,00:04:36.026,"IT WAS A NICE RUN, KEV."
00:04:36.068,00:04:37.945,NOBODY WINS THEM ALL.
00:04:59.674,00:05:03.553,Lomax: HAVE YOU HAD ANY DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS IN MATH CLASS THIS YEAR?
00:05:03.595,00:05:04.596,NO.
00:05:06.056,00:05:07.975,NO?
00:05:08.016,00:05:11.895,ISN'T IT TRUE MR. GETTYS HAS HAD TO TALK TO YOU REPEATEDLY ABOUT YOUR BEHAVIOR?
00:05:11.937,00:05:14.522,ISN'T THAT WHY HE ASKED YOU TO STAY AFTER CLASS?
00:05:14.564,00:05:16.066,NO.
00:05:18.443,00:05:21.029,HAVE OTHER TEACHERS EVER ASKED YOU TO STAY AFTER CLASS?
00:05:21.071,00:05:22.489,ONCE OR TWICE.
00:05:22.530,00:05:24.199,DID THEY WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOUR BEHAVIOR?
00:05:24.241,00:05:25.617,OBJECTION.
00:05:25.659,00:05:26.952,GOES TO MOTIVE.
00:05:26.994,00:05:30.455,OVERRULED.
00:05:30.497,00:05:33.416,"WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER TEACHERS WANTED."
00:05:33.458,00:05:34.459,YOU'D HAVE TO TALK TO THEM.
00:05:37.336,00:05:39.631,"YOU EVER PASSED NOTES IN CLASS, BARBARA?"
00:05:42.259,00:05:45.637,MAYBE A NOTE THAT MADE FUN OF MR. GETTYS.
00:05:45.679,00:05:46.638,NO.
00:05:46.680,00:05:48.265,NO?
00:05:48.307,00:05:51.810,NEVER CALLED HIM A DISGUSTING PIG MONSTER?
00:05:53.645,00:05:55.647,Judge: ORDER.
00:05:55.689,00:05:57.482,NO.
00:05:57.524,00:06:00.652,"YOUR HONOR, I'VE PREMARKED THIS DEFENSE EXHIBIT A."
00:06:00.694,00:06:04.363,"OBJECTION. YOUR HONOR, WE'VE HAD PLENTY OF TIME FOR DISCOVERY HERE."
00:06:04.405,00:06:07.408,"I'M GONNA LET THIS IN, MR. LOMAX."
00:06:07.450,00:06:14.333,I'M ALSO GONNA SUGGEST THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER EXHIBITS YOU PRESENT IN A TIMELY FASHION OR NOT AT ALL.
00:06:16.459,00:06:18.503,"I'M SORRY, BARBARA, I WAS WRONG."
00:06:18.545,00:06:22.716,IT'S HUGE HOG BEAST.
00:06:22.757,00:06:24.634,"THIS IS YOUR HANDWRITING, ISN'T IT?"
00:06:24.676,00:06:26.928,"YES, BUT-- YOU WROTE THIS IN MR. GETTYS' CLASS."
00:06:26.970,00:06:28.096,IT'S A JOKE.
00:06:28.138,00:06:30.140,HE'S A HUGE HOG BEAST.
00:06:30.182,00:06:34.228,HE PROBABLY EATS A THOUSAND PANCAKES FOR BREAKFAST.
00:06:36.063,00:06:38.232,"YOU'RE WRITING HERE ABOUT MR. GETTYS, AREN'T YOU?"
00:06:38.273,00:06:40.399,IT WAS MEANT TO BE A JOKE.
00:06:42.694,00:06:47.574,"HAVE YOU EVER HAD A PARTY AT YOUR HOUSE, BARBARA, WHEN YOUR PARENTS WERE AWAY?"
00:06:47.615,00:06:49.076,"OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR."
00:06:49.117,00:06:50.911,CREDIBILITY AND BIAS.
00:06:50.952,00:06:52.537,OVERRULED.
00:06:52.579,00:06:55.582,ANSWER THE QUESTION.
00:06:55.623,00:06:56.708,YES.
00:06:58.252,00:07:01.713,HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A GAME CALLED SPECIAL PLACES?
00:07:03.924,00:07:06.176,"YOU'RE UNDER OATH, BARBARA."
00:07:06.218,00:07:08.387,A MAN'S CAREER...
00:07:08.427,00:07:09.888,HIS REPUTATION...
00:07:09.930,00:07:11.973,HIS LIFE IS ON THE LINE!
00:07:12.015,00:07:13.641,THIS IS NOT A JOKE!
00:07:13.683,00:07:17.437,HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED THE GAME SPECIAL PLACES?
00:07:23.735,00:07:26.405,IS THIS GAME SEXUAL IN NATURE?
00:07:28.115,00:07:31.076,IS THIS GAME SEXUAL IN NATURE?
00:07:31.118,00:07:34.371,WE ONLY PLAYED IT ONCE.
00:07:34.413,00:07:41.962,"THIS SPECIAL PARTY, BARBARA, THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME YOU TOLD THE STORY ABOUT MR. GETTYS, WASN'T IT?"
00:07:42.003,00:07:44.089,YES.
00:07:44.131,00:07:47.217,I'VE SPOKEN TO SOME OF THE OTHER CHILDREN WHO WERE THERE THAT DAY.
00:07:47.259,00:07:53.723,"CAN YOU THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE, BARBARA, THEY MIGHT HAVE TOLD-- OBJECTION! YOUR HONOR, IF HE HAS OTHER WITNESSES, LET HIM CALL THEM!"
00:07:53.765,00:07:56.268,"IF I NEED TO CALL THOSE OTHER CHILDREN, I WILL!"
00:07:56.310,00:07:57.602,I WILL SUSTAIN THAT.
00:07:57.644,00:08:00.563,"MR. LOMAX, REPHRASE YOUR QUESTION."
00:08:06.653,00:08:08.989,"YOU THREATENED THOSE CHILDREN, DIDN'T YOU?"
00:08:09.030,00:08:10.782,THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT HAPPENED.
00:08:10.824,00:08:14.953,"YOU TOLD THEM TO LIE, TO FALSELY CLAIM THAT MR. GETTYS HAD HURT THEM."
00:08:14.995,00:08:16.913,THESE THINGS DID HAPPEN!
00:08:16.955,00:08:21.042,"BECAUSE IF THEY DIDN'T GO ALONG, YOU WERE GOING TO TELL EVERYONE ABOUT THIS SPECIAL PARTY."
00:08:21.084,00:08:23.128,THEY HAPPENED TO ME.
00:08:23.170,00:08:25.839,"SO YOU MADE UP A STORY, A SPECIAL STORY."
00:08:25.880,00:08:30.885,"A STORY ABOUT A MATH TEACHER WHO WAS TOUGH ON YOU, WHO KEPT YOU AFTER CLASS."
00:08:30.927,00:08:33.347,A HUGE HOG BEAST YOU DIDN'T LIKE!
00:08:33.388,00:08:35.432,"THAT'S WHAT REALLY HAPPENED, ISN'T IT?"
00:08:35.474,00:08:40.020,NO. I DIDN'T WANT TO BE THE ONLY ONE.
00:08:40.061,00:08:41.688,Man: SON OF A BITCH!
00:08:41.729,00:08:44.024,YOU GODDAMN LOW-LIFE SON OF A BITCH!

00:09:25.606,00:09:32.947,"SO, KEV, OFF THE RECORD, HOW DOES IT FEEL TO SQUEEZE A MAN LIKE GETTYS THROUGH THE DOOR OF REASONABLE DOUBT?"
00:09:32.989,00:09:36.284,"HARRY, WHY DON'T YOU QUIT BEING A PARTY POOPER?"
00:09:36.326,00:09:37.785,HAVE YOURSELF A DRINK.
00:09:37.827,00:09:39.996,WE'RE NOT GONNA DISCUSS THE DAMN CASE ANYMORE.

00:50:19.642,00:50:21.268,"WHAT'S UP, JOHN?"
00:50:21.310,00:50:24.772,"LEAMON, HOW MANY HOURS WE BILL ALEX CULLEN FOR LAST YEAR?"
00:50:27.065,00:50:29.360,"16,242."
00:50:29.401,00:50:31.069,WHAT THE FUCK DID HE DO NOW?
00:50:31.111,00:50:39.954,"ALEX CULLEN HAS JUST BEEN CHARGED WITH MURDERING HIS WIFE, HER STEPSON, AND A MAID."
00:50:41.455,00:50:42.915,WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?
00:50:42.957,00:50:44.792,"JUST NOW, TONIGHT."

00:51:03.519,00:51:08.315,ALEXANDER CULLEN IN A MANHATTAN TRIPLE MURDER WITH--EXCUSE ME--KEVIN?
00:51:08.357,00:51:10.818,HA! YOU'RE DREAMING.

00:51:25.708,00:51:28.544,"YOU'RE THE MASTER, BUT, YOU KNOW, I..."
00:51:28.586,00:51:30.212,I JUST DON'T SEE THIS HAPPENING.
00:51:30.254,00:51:32.297,"I WANT YOU ON BOARD, EDDIE."
00:51:33.465,00:51:37.011,"LOOK, I, UH, I APPRECIATE THE VOTE OF CONFIDENCE, BUT..."
00:51:37.053,00:51:38.804,MAYBE EDDIE HAS A POINT HERE.
00:51:38.846,00:51:41.933,WE CAN GET THIS CASE.
00:51:41.974,00:51:44.727,"HE'S A BUSINESS CLIENT, JOHN."
00:51:44.769,00:51:47.103,WE KNOW HIM BETTER THAN HE KNOWS HIMSELF.
00:51:47.145,00:51:49.565,WE GOT THE INSIDE TRACK.
00:51:49.607,00:51:52.401,WE GOT THE BEST DAMN TRIAL LAWYER IN THE CITY.
00:51:52.443,00:51:53.903,IT'S OURS TO LOSE.

00:52:33.149,00:52:35.360,Mary Ann: YOU LEFT ME THERE.
00:52:36.654,00:52:40.616,I HAD A FUCKIN' PANIC ATTACK UNTIL JACKIE TOLD ME WHERE YOU WERE.

00:52:48.124,00:52:59.426,"I'M WITH MILTON, HEATH, AND BARZOON, AND THERE'S A VERY GOOD POSSIBILITY THAT I'M ABOUT TO CATCH A TRIPLE HOMICIDE DEFENDANT WHO ALSO HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THE LARGEST REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS IN THE CITY."
00:53:00.469,00:53:02.554,"MARE, I HAD TO BAIL ON THE PARTY."

00:53:12.230,00:53:15.067,"THE NEXT TIME YOU MAKE A PROMISE, YOU TRY AND KEEP IT!"
00:53:15.109,00:53:17.069,"YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME, RIGHT?"

00:53:29.999,00:53:32.208,"I'M NOT OUT 20 MINUTES, I'M BEING FOLLOWED BY THE GODDAMNED PRESS."
00:53:32.250,00:53:34.210,THEY'RE LIKE INSECTS DOWN THERE.
00:53:34.252,00:53:36.088,"ALEX, JUST CALM DOWN AND LISTEN, OK?"
00:53:36.130,00:53:37.631,CHRIST.
00:53:38.632,00:53:40.092,I DON'T KNOW.
00:53:40.134,00:53:42.094,MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
00:53:40.134,00:53:43.595,"MAYBE HE IS A WHIZ KID, BUT JESUS CHRIST!"
00:53:43.637,00:53:46.264,"THIS IS MY ASS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, JOHN! EDDIE?"
00:53:46.306,00:53:47.892,ALEX...

00:54:11.707,00:54:13.625,I DON'T KNOW. I...
00:54:13.667,00:54:15.794,I'M GONNA HAVE TO LOOK AROUND.
00:54:18.839,00:54:21.133,"YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO SHOP, MR. CULLEN."
00:54:21.175,00:54:25.470,JURY SELECTION STARTED THIS MORNING AT EVERY BREAKFAST TABLE IN THE CITY.
00:54:25.512,00:54:27.639,THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE KNOW.
00:54:27.681,00:54:29.349,3 DEAD BODIES.
00:54:29.391,00:54:31.143,YOU DISCOVER THE CRIME.
00:54:31.185,00:54:33.145,YOU CALL IT IN.
00:54:33.187,00:54:36.023,YOU'VE GOT BLOOD ON YOUR PERSON AND CLOTHES.

00:54:41.737,00:54:43.155,HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
00:54:43.197,00:54:45.657,THERE'S A SECOND PRINT...
00:54:45.699,00:54:46.658,IN BLOOD.
00:54:46.700,00:54:50.662,IT'S A PARTIAL OF A HAND ON THE WALL NEXT TO THE BODIES.
00:54:50.704,00:54:53.624,I HAVE KEYS.
00:54:53.665,00:54:55.084,I TOUCHED THE GODDAMNED WALL!
00:54:55.126,00:54:56.835,I PANICKED!
00:54:56.877,00:54:58.712,WE NEED 12 PEOPLE WHO CAN SEE PAST ALL THAT.
00:54:58.754,00:55:00.338,I TOUCHED A GODDAMN WALL!
00:55:00.380,00:55:02.174,I'D GET OUT IN FRONT OF THIS FAST.
00:55:02.216,00:55:04.676,I PANICKED!
00:55:04.718,00:55:06.720,I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.
00:55:08.388,00:55:10.015,THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.
00:55:10.057,00:55:12.143,HOW AM I GONNA CONVINCE ANYBODY?
00:55:12.184,00:55:13.685,I'M INNOCENT.
00:55:14.728,00:55:17.189,"HE'S RIGHT, ALEX."
00:55:17.231,00:55:19.691,PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR THESE THINGS.
00:55:19.733,00:55:21.359,"AH, CHRIST, EDDIE."
00:55:21.401,00:55:23.695,YOU'RE NOT HAPPY TOMORROW?

00:55:26.949,00:55:31.536,"BUT RIGHT NOW, THIS MOMENT, YOU NEED IMMEDIATE REPRESENTATION."
00:55:31.578,00:55:36.708,I HAVE A 14-YEAR-OLD STEPDAUGHTER WHO I CARE MORE ABOUT THAN ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD.
00:55:36.750,00:55:39.711,THEY WOULDN'T LET ME TALK TO HER FROM DOWNTOWN.
00:55:39.753,00:55:42.173,THEY WON'T LET ME TALK TO HER NOW THAT I'M OUT!
00:55:42.214,00:55:45.092,WE NEED TO ISSUE A STATEMENT.
00:55:47.094,00:55:48.762,"HE'S A WINNER, ALEX."
00:55:48.804,00:55:50.848,JUST LIKE YOU WERE.
00:55:50.889,00:55:53.809,AND THEY'LL NEVER SEE HIM COMING.
00:55:54.810,00:55:57.313,"OH, JESUS CHRIST."
00:56:00.107,00:56:03.777,"I GOT SOME, UH, I GOT SOME TOUGH PHONE CALLS I GOTTA..."

00:56:31.805,00:56:34.266,NOT IF THEY WERE GIVING IT AWAY.

00:56:45.986,00:56:47.779,I WANT YOU LOOSE AND PLIABLE THIS AFTERNOON.
00:56:47.821,00:56:51.783,"Andrea: KIKO, LET'S GET ANOTHER BOTTLE OF CHARDONNAY FOR MRS. BARZOON AND MRS. HEATH RIGHT AWAY."
00:56:51.825,00:56:53.785,"OH, LORD."
00:56:53.827,00:56:55.746,YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO?
00:56:55.787,00:57:01.126,"YOU SHOULD BUY IT, WEAR IT ONCE, AND THEN THROW IT AWAY."
00:57:01.168,00:57:03.128,THAT'LL LOOSEN YOU UP.

00:57:04.338,00:57:06.173,SPEND IT ALL.
00:57:06.215,00:57:10.594,"IF YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO SEE YOUR HUSBAND, YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS MONEY."
00:57:10.635,00:57:20.145,"I SWEAR, IF EDDIE WASN'T AFRAID OF ME SHOUTING MY MOUTH OFF, HE WOULD HAVE PUT A CELLULITE CLAUSE IN THE PRE-NUP."
00:57:20.187,00:57:22.147,"DR. ROBERT, I'M TELLING YOU."
00:57:22.189,00:57:23.648,HE'S THE MIRACLE MAN.

00:57:25.192,00:57:27.569,"I MEAN, WHO DOES IT BETTER THAN THAT?"
00:57:27.611,00:57:29.863,IT'S NOT MY TITS I'M WORRIED ABOUT.
00:57:31.698,00:57:33.533,NOT TOO BIG...
00:57:34.534,00:57:35.869,Jackie: PERFECT.
00:57:36.870,00:57:37.955,REAL OR NOT?
00:57:39.998,00:57:41.959,THEY LOOK REAL.
00:57:42.960,00:57:44.878,THEY MUST BE REAL.

00:57:47.256,00:57:48.506,"OH, NO. IT'S OK."

00:58:03.981,00:58:05.482,WHEN YOU'RE READY.
00:58:26.044,00:58:27.171,"OH, GOD."
00:58:29.089,00:58:30.590,SO...
00:58:30.632,00:58:32.550,WHAT DO YOU THINK?
00:58:34.052,00:58:36.472,I DON'T CARE IF THEY CAN HEAR ME.
00:58:36.513,00:58:39.141,I DON'T CARE!
00:58:39.183,00:58:41.477,"I DON'T LIKE IT HERE, KEVIN."
00:58:41.518,00:58:43.061,THESE WOMEN.
00:58:43.103,00:58:44.771,"MY GOD, I MEAN, I'M SEEING THINGS, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!"
00:58:44.813,00:58:46.690,YOU JUST LEFT THEM IN THE STORE?
00:58:46.731,00:58:47.399,YES!
00:58:47.441,00:58:48.400,"LOOK, CALM DOWN!"

00:58:50.194,00:58:51.695,MARE! MARE!
00:58:52.612,00:58:54.239,FIRST...
00:58:55.532,00:58:57.493,YOU DO THIS RADICAL THING TO YOUR HAIR.
00:58:57.534,00:58:58.994,"OH, DO YOU HATE IT?"
00:58:59.036,00:59:00.496,STOP.
00:59:00.537,00:59:01.497,NO.
00:59:01.538,00:59:03.332,I THINK IT'S FINE!
00:59:03.374,00:59:05.167,BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S TRAUMATIC.
00:59:06.543,00:59:10.506,YOU'VE GOT THE PRESSURE OF FITTING IN WITH NEW FRIENDS.
00:59:10.547,00:59:12.174,A NEW PLACE.
00:59:12.216,00:59:14.051,ADD TO THAT A COUPLE BOTTLES OF WINE.
00:59:14.092,00:59:15.052,NO.
00:59:15.093,00:59:16.053,NO.
00:59:16.094,00:59:18.055,"IT WASN'T THE WINE, KEVIN."
00:59:18.096,00:59:26.021,IT WASN'T THE WINE OR MY HAIR OR TALKING TO KATHY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY!
00:59:26.063,00:59:27.898,WHAT ABOUT KATHY?
00:59:27.939,00:59:30.025,WHAT ABOUT YOUR SISTER?
00:59:30.067,00:59:32.194,WHAT ABOUT HER?
00:59:32.236,00:59:33.529,OH.
00:59:33.570,00:59:36.114,THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
00:59:38.742,00:59:41.537,"KEVIN, I NEVER SEE YOU ANYMORE."
00:59:41.578,00:59:46.875,"AND NOW THAT YOU'VE GOT THIS BIG CASE, IT'S JUST ONLY GONNA GET WORSE."
00:59:46.917,00:59:51.547,"IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT, I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING YOUR MOTHER COME AND VISIT."
00:59:51.588,00:59:53.424,WHAT ABOUT THE APARTMENT?
00:59:53.465,00:59:55.259,GOD DAMN YOU!
00:59:55.300,00:59:57.553,WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO GO AND CHANGE THINGS AROUND?
00:59:57.594,00:59:59.388,THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE APARTMENT!
00:59:59.430,01:00:02.558,I HATE THIS STUPID PLACE!
01:00:02.599,01:00:04.560,YOU KNOW...

01:23:51.777,01:23:53.737,"MRS. SKYLAR, THIS ISN'T FAIR."
01:23:53.779,01:23:55.364,I HAD 15 MORE MINUTES.
01:23:55.405,01:23:58.241,"YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL NEXT WEEK, MR. CULLEN."
01:23:58.283,01:24:00.577,"ALLESANDRA, I'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK."
01:24:00.619,01:24:02.454,"Man: THAT'S IT, MR. CULLEN."
01:24:03.956,01:24:05.749,UH-HUH. FOR SLEEP.
01:24:05.791,01:24:07.751,AND SHE CAN TAKE THAT DURING THE DAY?
01:24:07.793,01:24:09.753,"NO, SHE WON'T BE DRIVING."
01:24:09.795,01:24:12.255,I'M GONNA HAVE THE PHARMACY CALL YOU RIGHT BACK.
01:24:12.297,01:24:13.256,THANKS.
01:24:13.298,01:24:17.761,HE THINKS-- HE'S NOT SURE-- HE THINKS IT COULD BE SOME KIND OF HORMONAL IMBALANCE.
01:24:17.803,01:24:19.763,I'M TAKING YOU OFF THE CASE.
01:24:19.805,01:24:21.097,WHAT?
01:24:21.139,01:24:23.266,I WANT YOU TO DROP THIS CASE.
01:24:23.308,01:24:24.768,THIS CASE? CULLEN?
01:24:24.810,01:24:26.770,"JOHN, I'VE GOT A JURY SHOWING UP THIS MORNING."
01:24:26.812,01:24:28.271,DO YOU LOVE THIS WOMAN?
01:24:28.313,01:24:29.773,"YES, OF COURSE I DO."
01:24:29.815,01:24:31.775,"THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING, KEVIN? SHE'S SICK."
01:24:31.817,01:24:33.276,EVERYONE WILL UNDERSTAND.
01:24:33.318,01:24:34.778,I'LL UNDERSTAND.
01:24:34.820,01:24:36.780,WHAT ABOUT CULLEN?
01:24:36.822,01:24:42.786,"WE FIND SOMEBODY NEW, YOU CONSULT, YOU LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY, SON."
01:24:42.828,01:24:44.788,WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT CONSULT?
01:24:44.830,01:24:46.456,I PUT TOGETHER A GREAT JURY.
01:24:46.498,01:24:48.124,"IT'S A DISAPPOINTMENT, I KNOW."
01:24:48.166,01:24:50.126,WE HAVE 'EM.
01:24:50.168,01:24:51.795,YOU USE IT.
01:24:51.837,01:24:53.338,AND THEN YOU MOVE ON.
01:24:55.173,01:24:56.550,HANG ON.
01:24:56.592,01:24:58.385,WE GOTTA TALK ABOUT THIS.
01:24:58.427,01:25:00.054,"AH, LISTEN TO YOURSELF, KEVIN."
01:25:00.095,01:25:01.889,WE GOTTA TALK ABOUT THIS.
01:25:01.931,01:25:03.557,"IT'S YOUR WIFE, MAN."
01:25:03.599,01:25:05.559,SHE'S SICK.
01:25:05.601,01:25:07.061,SHE'S GOTTA COME FIRST.
01:25:07.102,01:25:08.562,"ALL RIGHT, WAIT A MINUTE."
01:25:08.604,01:25:09.939,WAIT A MINUTE.
01:25:09.980,01:25:14.359,YOU MEAN THE POSSIBILITY OF LEAVING THIS CASE HAS NEVER EVEN ENTERED YOUR MIND?
01:25:18.614,01:25:20.574,YOU KNOW WHAT SCARES ME?
01:25:21.617,01:25:24.578,"I QUIT THE CASE, SHE GETS BETTER..."
01:25:24.620,01:25:26.371,AND I HATE HER FOR IT.
01:25:26.413,01:25:28.999,"I DON'T WANT TO RESENT HER, JOHN."
01:25:29.041,01:25:30.584,I'VE GOT A WINNER HERE.
01:25:30.626,01:25:32.586,I'VE GOT TO NAIL THIS FUCKER DOWN.
01:25:32.628,01:25:34.797,"DO IT FAST, PUT IT BEHIND ME."
01:25:34.838,01:25:36.590,THEN...
01:25:36.632,01:25:38.092,THEN...
01:25:38.133,01:25:40.886,PUT ALL MY ENERGY INTO HER.
01:25:46.642,01:25:48.727,I STAND CORRECTED.
01:25:48.769,01:25:50.228,SO FILL ME IN.
01:25:50.270,01:25:52.606,DID CULLEN'S ASSISTANT ADMIT TO HAVING THE AFFAIR?
01:25:52.648,01:25:56.110,"SHE DID TO ME, BUT SHE WON'T IN COURT."
01:25:56.192,01:25:58.112,"WELL, CONVINCE HER OTHERWISE."
01:25:58.153,01:26:12.084,"AND WHEN ALL THAT EVIDENCE IS LAID BEFORE YOU, WHEN ALL THESE PIECES WEAVE TOGETHER, YOU WILL CONCLUDE, YOU WILL KNOW THAT ALEXANDER CULLEN IS GUILTY OF MURDERING 3 PEOPLE..."
01:26:12.126,01:26:13.961,IN COLD BLOOD...
01:26:14.003,01:26:16.630,AND WITH MALICE OF FORETHOUGHT.
01:26:16.672,01:26:18.173,THANK YOU.
01:26:19.174,01:26:20.134,YOUR HONOR.
01:26:20.175,01:26:25.555,"MR. LOMAX, UH, WE CAN BREAK FOR LUNCH NOW, OR YOU CAN DO A STOP-AND-START."
01:26:25.597,01:26:27.933,"IF IT'S A CHOICE, I'LL GO NOW, YOUR HONOR."
01:26:27.975,01:26:30.268,I WON'T BE AS LONG AS MR. BROYGO.
01:26:30.310,01:26:31.812,PROCEED.
01:26:36.692,01:26:42.990,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY, I KNOW YOU'VE SPENT ALL MORNING LISTENING TO MR. BROYGO TALK."
01:26:43.032,01:26:44.491,I KNOW YOU'RE HUNGRY.
01:26:44.533,01:26:47.786,WHAT I NEED TO TELL YOU WON'T TAKE VERY LONG AT ALL.
01:26:49.038,01:26:52.166,I DON'T LIKE ALEXANDER CULLEN.
01:26:52.207,01:26:55.335,I DON'T THINK HE'S A NICE PERSON.
01:26:55.377,01:26:57.420,I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO LIKE HIM.
01:26:57.462,01:27:01.424,HE'S BEEN A TERRIBLE HUSBAND TO ALL 3 OF HIS WIVES.
01:27:01.466,01:27:05.179,HE'S BEEN A DESTRUCTIVE FORCE IN THE LIVES OF HIS STEPCHILDREN.
01:27:05.220,01:27:07.597,"HE'S CHEATED THE CITY, HIS PARTNERS, HIS EMPLOYEES."
01:27:07.639,01:27:08.724,WHAT THE FUCK?
01:27:08.765,01:27:12.019,HE'S PAID HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN PENALTIES AND FINES OVER THE YEARS.
01:27:12.061,01:27:15.189,I DON'T LIKE HIM.
01:27:15.230,01:27:21.862,I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOME THINGS DURING THE COURSE OF THIS TRIAL THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE YOU LIKE HIM EVEN LESS.
01:27:21.904,01:27:25.199,BUT THIS ISN'T A POPULARITY CONTEST.
01:27:25.240,01:27:26.700,IT'S A MURDER TRIAL.
01:27:27.910,01:27:37.044,AND THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT PROVABLE FACT OF THIS PROCEEDING IS THAT ALEXANDER CULLEN WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE...
01:27:37.086,01:27:41.423,WHEN THESE HORRIBLE CRIMES TOOK PLACE.
01:27:42.758,01:27:47.137,"NOW, THE STATE, THE STATE'S GOING ALL OUT HERE."
01:27:47.179,01:27:49.139,THEY'VE GOT THIS WHOLE TEAM HERE.
01:27:49.181,01:27:52.226,THEY'RE THROWING EVERYTHING BUT THE KITCHEN SINK AT THIS CASE.
01:27:52.267,01:27:53.602,I WANT ONE THING FROM YOU.
01:27:53.643,01:27:55.562,THAT'S IT.
01:27:55.604,01:27:56.939,ONE THING.
01:27:58.107,01:28:01.735,I WANT YOU TO ASK YOURSELF...
01:28:01.777,01:28:04.238,IS NOT LIKING THIS MAN...
01:28:05.614,01:28:08.408,REASON ENOUGH...
01:28:08.450,01:28:10.452,TO CONVICT HIM OF MURDER?
01:28:12.746,01:28:14.456,ENJOY YOUR LUNCH.
01:28:14.497,01:28:16.166,WE'LL TALK AGAIN.
01:28:18.043,01:28:19.962,WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT ABOUT?
01:28:20.003,01:28:21.922,THEY'RE GONNA HATE ME!
01:28:21.964,01:28:24.507,LISTEN TO ME LIKE YOU'VE NEVER LISTENED TO ANYBODY BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE!
01:28:24.549,01:28:31.431,"I'M GONNA BUST MY ASS TO MAKE SURE THEY HATE YOU, BECAUSE AS LONG AS YOU'RE OUT BONING MELISSA, YOU'RE NOT HOME KILLING YOUR WIFE!"
01:28:34.017,01:28:35.769,WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING BEFORE?
01:28:37.187,01:28:38.855,THEN IT DOESN'T LOOK SPONTANEOUS.
01:28:41.691,01:28:43.235,"OH, YOU GOT IT NOW?"
01:28:46.863,01:28:48.073,YEAH.
01:28:53.036,01:28:54.163,HEY!
01:28:54.204,01:28:55.247,KEVIN!
01:28:55.289,01:28:56.498,EDDIE.
01:28:56.539,01:28:58.500,SAW YOU GO IN.
01:28:58.541,01:28:59.668,WHAT'S UP?
01:28:59.709,01:29:01.503,"WELL, CONGRATULATIONS."
01:29:01.544,01:29:03.005,IT'S NOT OVER YET.
01:29:03.046,01:29:05.507,"YEAH, WELL, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE TRIAL."
01:29:05.548,01:29:07.342,WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
01:29:07.383,01:29:11.054,HOW THE FUCK DOES YOUR NAME GET IN THE FIRM'S CHARTER?
01:29:12.055,01:29:13.348,WHAT?
01:29:13.389,01:29:15.017,IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN THERE FOR YEARS.
01:29:15.058,01:29:17.311,SO NOW YOU'RE A PARTNER.
01:29:17.352,01:29:20.772,"YOU KNOW, I STILL AM THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THIS FIRM."
01:29:20.814,01:29:23.025,"YOU WANT MY JOB, TAKE ME HEAD ON."
01:29:23.066,01:29:28.697,"YOU BACKDOOR ME ONE MORE TIME, I'LL TAKE YOUR PARTNERSHIP PAPERS, AND I'LL SHOVE 'EM DOWN YOUR THROAT."
01:29:28.738,01:29:32.326,"I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, BUT I SURE AS HELL DON'T LIKE THE TONE OF YOUR VOICE."
01:29:32.367,01:29:33.493,"AH, BULLSHIT!"
01:29:33.535,01:29:38.373,"YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH DOCUMENTS, I SUGGEST YOU PUT TOGETHER ONE OF YOUR LATE-NIGHT SHREDDING SESSIONS."
01:29:38.414,01:29:40.042,AHH.
01:29:43.419,01:29:46.006,YOU THINK YOU'RE TOUGH ENOUGH TO RUN THIS FIRM?
01:29:46.048,01:29:47.423,HA!
01:29:47.465,01:29:49.551,REMEMBER THE WEAVER COMMISSION INVESTIGATION?
01:29:49.592,01:29:56.599,"TELL YOUR MENTOR THE NEXT TIME WEAVER CALLS ME, MAYBE I'LL JUST PICK UP THE PHONE."
01:30:00.603,01:30:02.022,Milton: WAS HE DRUNK?
01:30:02.064,01:30:03.565,I DOUBT IT.
01:30:03.606,01:30:05.108,HE WAS GOING RUNNING.
01:30:05.150,01:30:07.527,WHAT THE HELL WAS HE TALKING ABOUT?
01:30:09.154,01:30:16.286,"EDDIE'S GOT HIMSELF IN TROUBLE AGAIN, AND HE WANTS ME TO SAVE HIM, ONLY THIS TIME I CAN'T."
01:30:17.411,01:30:20.040,"WELL, WHY DOES HE THINK I'M AFTER HIS JOB?"
01:30:20.082,01:30:23.585,YOU EVER HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE WITH MANIC DEPRESSION?
01:30:23.626,01:30:24.878,"NOT DIRECTLY, NO."
01:30:24.920,01:30:26.088,"WELL, YOU DO NOW."
01:30:26.129,01:30:27.089,Woman on intercom: 346.
01:30:27.130,01:30:28.924,IT'S ME. GET EDDIE BARZOON.
01:30:28.965,01:30:32.052,"HE MAY BE OUT RUNNING, SO YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PAGE HIM."
01:30:32.094,01:30:33.262,IT'S AN EMERGENCY.
01:30:33.303,01:30:34.470,"Woman: YES, SIR."
01:30:34.512,01:30:36.306,YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD USE A DRINK.
01:30:36.348,01:30:38.767,"YES, YES, THANKS."
01:30:38.808,01:30:43.563,"Milton: EDDIE BARZOON, EDDIE BARZOON. HA!"
01:30:43.605,01:30:50.028,"I NURSED HIM THROUGH 2 DIVORCES, A COCAINE REHAB, AND A PREGNANT RECEPTIONIST."
01:30:50.070,01:30:53.115,"GOD'S CREATURE, RIGHT?"
01:30:53.156,01:30:56.701,GOD'S SPECIAL CREATURE? HA!
01:30:56.743,01:30:58.661,"AND I'VE WARNED HIM, KEVIN."
01:30:58.703,01:31:01.790,I'VE WARNED HIM EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.
01:31:01.831,01:31:10.257,"WATCHING HIM BOUNCE AROUND LIKE A FUCKING GAME, LIKE A WIND-UP TOY, LIKE 250 POUNDS OF SELF-SERVING GREED ON WHEELS."
01:31:10.299,01:31:12.968,"THE NEXT THOUSAND YEARS IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER, KEVIN."
01:31:13.009,01:31:14.928,EDDIE BARZOON.
01:31:14.970,01:31:16.470,EXCUSE ME!
01:31:16.512,01:31:19.724,BECAUSE HE'S THE POSTER CHILD FOR THE NEXT MILLENNIUM.
01:31:21.351,01:31:22.769,Milton: THESE PEOPLE.
01:31:22.811,01:31:25.355,IT'S NO MYSTERY WHERE THEY COME FROM.
01:31:26.940,01:31:34.948,YOU SHARPEN THE HUMAN APPETITE TO THE POINT WHERE IT CAN SPLIT ATOMS WITH ITS DESIRE.
01:31:34.990,01:31:45.459,"YOU BUILD EGOS THE SIZE OF CATHEDRALS, FIBER OPTICALLY CONNECT THE WORLD TO EVERY EAGER IMPULSE, GREASE EVEN THE DULLEST DREAMS WITH THESE..."
01:31:45.499,01:31:52.299,"DOLLAR-GREEN, GOLD-PLATED FANTASIES UNTIL EVERY HUMAN BECOMES AN ASPIRING EMPEROR, BECOMES HIS OWN GOD."
01:31:52.341,01:31:53.383,AND WHERE CAN YOU GO FROM THERE?
01:31:53.425,01:31:54.843,"Man: HEY, WRONG WAY!"
01:31:54.884,01:31:56.052,"YEAH, YEAH."
01:31:56.094,01:31:57.511,FUCK YOU!
01:31:57.553,01:32:04.978,"AND AS WE'RE SCRAMBLING FROM ONE DEAL TO THE NEXT, WHO'S GOT HIS EYE ON THE PLANET AS THE AIR THICKENS, THE WATER SOURS?"
01:32:05.020,01:32:09.523,"EVEN THE BEE'S HONEY TAKES ON THE METALLIC TASTE OF RADIOACTIVITY, AND IT JUST KEEPS COMING."
01:32:09.565,01:32:10.900,FASTER AND FASTER.
01:32:10.942,01:32:13.862,"OH, FUCK!"
01:32:13.903,01:32:16.698,"Milton: THERE'S NO CHANCE TO THINK, TO PREPARE."
01:32:16.739,01:32:21.619,"IT'S BUY FUTURES, SELL FUTURES WHEN THERE IS NO FUTURE."
01:32:21.661,01:32:24.247,"WE GOT A RUNAWAY TRAIN, BOY."
01:32:24.289,01:32:27.917,WE GOT A BILLION EDDIE BARZOONS ALL JOGGING INTO THE FUTURE.
01:32:27.959,01:32:39.804,"EVERY ONE OF 'EM GETTING READY TO FIST FUCK GOD'S EX-PLANET, LICK THEIR FINGERS CLEAN AS THEY REACH OUT TOWARD THEIR PRISTINE CYBERNETIC KEYBOARDS TO TOTE UP THEIR FUCKING BILLABLE HOURS."
01:32:39.846,01:32:42.598,AND THEN IT HITS HOME.
01:32:42.640,01:32:44.976,"YOU GOTTA PAY YOUR OWN WAY, EDDIE."
01:32:45.018,01:32:47.937,IT'S A LITTLE LATE IN THE GAME TO BUY OUT NOW.
01:32:47.979,01:32:49.439,GIVE ME YOUR WATCH.
01:32:49.481,01:32:51.107,WHAT?
01:32:51.149,01:32:53.776,DO YOU THINK-- YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO TRY AND TAKE IT.
01:32:53.818,01:33:02.869,"Milton: YOUR BELLY'S TOO FULL, YOUR DICK IS SORE, YOUR EYES ARE BLOODSHOT, AND YOU'RE SCREAMING FOR SOMEONE TO HELP, BUT GUESS WHAT."
01:33:02.911,01:33:05.705,THERE'S NO ONE THERE!
01:33:05.747,01:33:08.458,"YOU'RE ALL ALONE, EDDIE."
01:33:08.500,01:33:11.044,YOU'RE GOD'S SPECIAL LITTLE CREATURE.
01:33:11.086,01:33:12.128,OH!
01:33:12.170,01:33:13.213,NO!
01:33:17.759,01:33:19.553,MAYBE IT'S TRUE.
01:33:19.593,01:33:22.889,MAYBE GOD THREW THE DICE ONCE TOO OFTEN.
01:33:22.931,01:33:25.141,MAYBE HE LET US ALL DOWN.
01:33:34.608,01:33:41.366,Kevin: YOU TESTIFIED THE DEFENDANT CALLED YOU AT 4:30 TO ASK YOU TO COME TO HIS OFFICE GYM FOR THE PURPOSES OF SEX?
01:33:41.408,01:33:43.076,YES.
01:33:43.118,01:33:46.121,"MR. CULLEN, THOUGH, IS NOT JUST YOUR LOVER, IS HE?"
01:33:46.162,01:33:47.330,HE'S THE BOSS.
01:33:49.623,01:33:51.084,YES.
01:33:51.126,01:33:54.379,SO 2 HOURS GO BY BEFORE YOU ACT ON HIS REQUEST?
01:33:54.421,01:33:56.506,YES. I WENT UP AT 6:10.
01:33:56.548,01:34:00.594,"I KNOW IT WAS 6:10 BECAUSE I HEARD WEATHER COMING ON THE NEWS-- OK, STOP."
01:34:00.634,01:34:04.097,THIS PROSECUTOR IS NO FOOL.
01:34:04.139,01:34:08.059,"HE'S GONNA CHANGE TEMPO, ATTITUDE, TONE OF VOICE."
01:34:08.101,01:34:10.479,HE'S GONNA COME OUT WITH QUESTIONS YOU NEVER THOUGHT OF.
01:34:10.520,01:34:12.439,JUST TO SCREW YOU UP.
01:34:12.481,01:34:14.232,SO WHAT DO WE DO?
01:34:16.401,01:34:18.194,"YES AND NO ANSWERS, STAY CALM."
01:34:18.236,01:34:20.238,EXACTLY.

02:03:43.457,02:03:46.586,"WHO ARE YOU CARRYIN' ALL THOSE BRICKS FOR, ANYWAY?"
02:03:46.627,02:03:48.755,GOD?

02:04:06.480,02:04:10.610,"HE GIVES YOU THIS EXTRAORDINARY GIFT, AND THEN WHAT DOES HE DO?"

02:04:13.154,02:04:17.617,HIS OWN PRIVATE COSMIC GAG REEL...
02:04:17.658,02:04:20.787,HE SETS THE RULES IN OPPOSITION.
02:04:20.828,02:04:22.789,IT'S THE GOOF OF ALL TIME.
02:04:22.830,02:04:24.624,"LOOK, BUT DON'T TOUCH."
