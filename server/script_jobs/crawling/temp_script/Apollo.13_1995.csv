00:00:47.583,00:00:49.166,Roger that.
00:00:49.208,00:00:57.166,"Inspired by the late President Kennedy, in only seven years, America has risen to the challenge of what he called..."
00:00:57.208,00:01:00.709,the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure...
00:01:00.750,00:01:03.417,on which man has ever embarked.
00:01:03.458,00:01:09.750,After trailing the Russians for years with our manned space program-- - and after that sudden...
00:01:09.792,00:01:13.500,and horrible fire on the launchpad during a routine test...
00:01:13.542,00:01:18.959,"that killed American astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee, We're on fire!"
00:01:19.000,00:01:22.792,there were serious doubts that we could beat the Russians to the moon.
00:01:22.834,00:01:28.250,"But tonight, a mere 18 months after the tragedy of Apollo 1, the entire world watched in awe..."
00:01:28.291,00:01:32.333,as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon.
00:01:32.375,00:01:35.083,The big news came just a moment ago.
00:01:35.125,00:01:37.917,Mission Control gave the spacecraft permission...
00:01:37.959,00:01:47.667,"to go for the extravehicular activity-- that is, for the walk on the moon-- far earlier than anticipated, 9:00 p.m. eastern daylight time."
00:01:47.709,00:01:51.417,Now the important thing when you penetrate the lunar module is your attitude...
00:01:51.458,00:01:53.375,and your relative speed.
00:01:53.417,00:01:55.417,Now let's say this is me here in the command module...
00:01:55.458,00:01:57.959,and this is you.
00:01:58.000,00:02:00.583,"You're the LEM. This thing sticks out here in front, that's called a probe."
00:02:00.625,00:02:03.291,Is that true?
00:02:03.333,00:02:09.333,"And-And-- And, Tracy, I'll tell you, when you feel that thing slide in, everything's clicking, it's like no other feeling in the world."
00:02:11.834,00:02:14.333,A little liquid propulsion.
00:02:14.375,00:02:16.625,"Hey, how's it going over there at Mission Control?"
00:02:16.667,00:02:19.458,"Oh, it's nervous time."
00:02:19.500,00:02:21.375,Gene Kranz is gonna have puppies.
00:02:21.417,00:02:23.458,Hi.
00:02:23.500,00:02:27.458,"How do you do, Tracey?"
00:02:27.500,00:02:30.166,Wow.
00:02:30.208,00:02:33.000,With one hand on the wheel.
00:02:33.041,00:02:35.000,"Hey, Marilyn."
00:02:35.041,00:02:37.291,This is the last champagne in the city of Houston.
00:02:37.333,00:02:38.667,Very good. Very good.
00:02:38.709,00:02:40.542,Everything else all right?
00:02:40.583,00:02:42.792,Looks okay. Hey! Cadet Lovell.
00:02:42.834,00:02:45.250,Put this on ice in the back with the rest and make sure it gets cold.
00:02:45.291,00:02:46.917,You gonna get a haircut this summer?
00:02:46.959,00:02:48.125,I'm on vacation.
00:02:48.166,00:02:50.875,Oh. Get a haircut.
00:03:00.000,00:03:03.250,I wouldn't mind being up there tonight.
00:03:03.291,00:03:06.875,Don't worry. Our day's coming.
00:03:06.917,00:03:09.083,They're not gonna cut the program before number 14.
00:03:10.333,00:03:12.417,"You know, my cousin called."
00:03:12.458,00:03:15.500,Asked who we'd bribed to get on Jim Lovell's crew.
00:03:15.542,00:03:18.959,"I just told him, uh, they wanted to make sure he got the best."
00:03:19.000,00:03:21.166,"Well, they got that right."
00:03:21.208,00:03:22.542,What network do we want?
00:03:22.583,00:03:25.542,- Come on. Pick one.
00:03:27.709,00:03:30.000,Turn it up. Turn it up.
00:03:30.041,00:03:39.041,...completed putting on their space suits-- I really appreciate you all coming to this dress rehearsal party for my Apollo 12 landing.
00:03:41.125,00:03:50.417,"No, but I-I-I think we should all take a moment to-- to recognize the exemplary-- hell, damn near heroic effort..."
00:03:50.458,00:03:54.166,displayed by Neil Armstrong's backup for this historic moonwalk.
00:03:54.208,00:03:56.583,"And, of course, his crew."
00:03:54.208,00:03:59.375,"Let's hear it-- Let's hear it for Jim Lovell, Ken Mattingly and Fred Haise."
00:04:04.417,00:04:08.000,Oh! There he is! There he is.
00:04:08.041,00:04:10.208,There he is.
00:04:10.250,00:04:11.709,"You got a good picture, huh?"
00:04:13.291,00:04:18.208,"Okay, will you verify the position, uh-- the, uh, opening I ought to have on the camera?"
00:04:19.792,00:04:22.458,What?
00:04:22.500,00:04:24.125,"Jim, you think it's too late for him to abort?"
00:04:24.166,00:04:26.250,"No, no. He's got time to get out of there."
00:04:26.291,00:04:28.125,He just needs somebody to wave him off.
00:04:28.166,00:04:29.458,"Pull up, Neil!"
00:04:29.500,00:04:30.875,Quiet down! Shh!
00:04:32.750,00:04:35.083,"Okay, Neil, we can see you coming down the ladder now."
00:04:35.125,00:04:36.458,Okay.
00:04:36.500,00:04:38.917,"Boy, look at those pictures. Wow."
00:04:38.959,00:04:41.375,"I'm, uh, at the foot of the ladder."
00:04:41.417,00:04:48.250,"The LEM footpads are only, uh, depressed in the surface about, uh, one or two inches."
00:04:48.291,00:04:50.458,It's almost like a powder.
00:04:50.500,00:04:53.583,- Armstrong is on the moon.
00:04:53.625,00:04:57.750,Thirty-eight-year-old American standing on the surface of the moon...
00:04:59.709,00:05:03.041,"on this July 20, 1969."
00:05:03.083,00:05:11.875,"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."
00:05:11.917,00:05:18.250,"His quote was, That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."
00:05:33.083,00:05:34.834,"You're drunk, Lovell."
00:05:34.875,00:05:38.000,Yeah. I'm not used to the champagne.
00:05:38.041,00:05:40.000,Me neither.
00:05:43.417,00:05:46.000,I can't deal with cleaning up.
00:05:46.041,00:05:48.083,"All right, let's sell the house."
00:05:49.667,00:05:53.041,"They're back inside now, looking up at us."
00:05:53.083,00:05:55.458,Isn't that something?
00:05:55.500,00:06:00.208,I bet Jannie Armstrong doesn't get a wink of sleep tonight.
00:06:00.250,00:06:03.625,"on the far side on 8, I didn't sleep at all."
00:06:03.667,00:06:06.542,I just vacuumed over and over again.
00:06:06.583,00:06:11.083,Christopher Columbus and Charles Lindberg and Neil Armstrong.
00:06:13.333,00:06:15.959,Neil Armstrong.
00:06:26.750,00:06:29.041,"From now on, we live in a world where man has walked on the moon."
00:06:32.709,00:06:34.583,It's not a miracle.
00:06:36.041,00:06:37.834,We just decided to go.
00:06:39.417,00:06:51.041,"On Apollo 8, we were so close, just 60 nautical miles down, and-- and it was like I could just..."
00:06:51.083,00:06:53.917,step out and walk on the face of it.
00:06:59.375,00:07:01.625,I want to go back there.
00:07:07.875,00:07:09.375,Where's my mountain?
00:07:09.417,00:07:17.000,"Well, it-- It's, uh, right up by the-- It's-- Okay."
00:07:17.041,00:07:20.959,You see the-the where the shadow crosses the-- the white area there?
00:07:21.000,00:07:22.834,That's the Sea of Tranquility.
00:07:22.875,00:07:26.291,And your mountain's right there on the edge of that.
00:07:26.333,00:07:27.625,"Your mountain, Marilyn."
00:07:28.917,00:07:30.375,I don't see it.
00:07:33.291,00:07:35.333,"Well, you gotta look harder."
00:07:38.333,00:07:40.542,You-You-- You look harder.
00:07:42.792,00:07:44.458,While I-- Jim!
00:07:45.375,00:07:46.625,Jim.
00:07:55.500,00:07:59.417,is only the most visible member of a very large team.
00:07:59.458,00:08:04.750,"And all of us, right down to the-- the guy sweeping the floor are honored to be a part of it."
00:08:04.792,00:08:08.083,What did the man say?
00:08:08.125,00:08:12.083,"Well, that's exactly what we're doing here. This is divine inspiration, folks."
00:08:12.125,00:08:16.333,The best part of each one of us-- the belief that anything is possible.
00:08:16.375,00:08:19.875,Things like...
00:08:19.917,00:08:23.125,and-- and hold millions of pieces of information.
00:08:24.583,00:08:26.875,Or the Saturn 5 rocket.
00:08:26.917,00:08:30.625,Now this is the actual launch vehicle that will be taking Alan Shepard and his crew...
00:08:30.667,00:08:34.041,on the first leg of the Apollo 13 mission.
00:08:34.083,00:08:36.959,"When are you going up again, Jim?"
00:08:37.000,00:08:40.625,I'm slated to be the commander of Apollo 14 sometime late next year.
00:08:42.166,00:08:43.875,If there is an Apollo 14.
00:08:46.125,00:08:49.000,"Now, Jim, people in my state have been asking..."
00:08:49.041,00:08:51.500,why we're continuing to fund this program...
00:08:51.542,00:08:54.083,now that we've beaten the Russians to the moon.
00:08:54.125,00:08:57.291,Imagine if-- if Christopher Columbus had come back from the New World...
00:08:57.333,00:08:59.959,and no one returned in his footsteps.
00:09:00.000,00:09:04.041,"Attention, all personnel. Clear level three. Clear level three."
00:09:04.083,00:09:05.542,Are there any other questions?
00:09:07.041,00:09:09.208,H-How do you go to the bathroom in space?
00:09:09.250,00:09:12.834,"Well, I tell you, it's a highly technical process..."
00:09:12.875,00:09:18.917,"of, uh, cranking down the window and looking for a gas station, which, uh-- Oh, there's Deke Slayton."
00:09:20.875,00:09:23.792,"Deke, you might be able to answer this lady's question better than I."
00:09:23.834,00:09:27.000,"Deke is one of the original Mercury 7 astronauts, ladies and gentlemen."
00:09:27.041,00:09:30.875,And now he's our boss.
00:09:30.917,00:09:33.959,"So naturally, we kick back part of our salaries to Deke every month."
00:09:34.000,00:09:37.417,"How much this month, Deke?"
00:09:37.458,00:09:38.792,Sure. You bet.
00:09:40.834,00:09:41.959,Hey!
00:09:46.000,00:09:47.917,Anybody home?
00:09:47.959,00:09:50.041,"a cheerleader, Mom."
00:09:50.083,00:09:52.000,You don't understand.
00:09:52.041,00:09:55.792,"Barbara, maybe I don't understand, but you are not wearing that out in this neighborhood."
00:09:55.834,00:09:57.709,That's the end of it.
00:09:57.750,00:09:59.750,She's not even wearing a bra.
00:09:59.792,00:10:00.917,Susan!
00:10:00.959,00:10:03.125,"Hey, everybody."
00:10:03.166,00:10:07.625,"Marilyn, trick or treat. You know that Easter vacation trip we had planned for Acapulco?"
00:10:07.667,00:10:09.542,Uh-oh.
00:10:09.583,00:10:11.709,"Well, I was thinking, uh, there might be a slight change in destination."
00:10:11.750,00:10:13.125,Really.
00:10:14.667,00:10:16.375,"Maybe, say..."
00:10:16.417,00:10:17.458,the moon.
00:10:20.542,00:10:23.333,Al Shepard's ear infection has flared up.
00:10:23.375,00:10:27.417,And we've all been bumped up to the prime crew of Apollo 13.
00:10:27.458,00:10:31.959,Straight to the head of the line and the Fra Mauro Highlands.
00:10:32.000,00:10:34.375,Six months?
00:10:34.417,00:10:35.834,"Dad, can I please wear this?"
00:10:37.542,00:10:38.792,Sure.
00:10:38.834,00:10:40.166,"No! No, absolutely not."
00:10:41.875,00:10:43.417,This stinks.
00:10:43.458,00:10:45.875,"They're not rushing things, are they?"
00:10:45.917,00:10:47.709,"I mean, you're gonna be ready in six months?"
00:10:47.750,00:10:49.250,We'll be ready.
00:10:49.291,00:10:52.166,"Boy, I wouldn't want to be around Al Shepard tonight."
00:10:52.208,00:10:54.458,I gotta get over there.
00:10:55.166,00:10:56.583,Go. Go.
00:10:56.625,00:10:58.875,"I'm gonna walk on the moon, Marilyn."
00:10:58.917,00:11:02.709,I know.
00:11:02.750,00:11:05.750,Naturally it's 13.
00:11:05.792,00:11:07.709,"It comes after 12, hon."
00:11:11.041,00:11:15.333,"Apollo 13, you are go for pyro arm and docking."
00:11:15.375,00:11:19.291,All systems are nominal and on the line.
00:11:19.333,00:11:23.166,"Okay, S4B is stable."
00:11:23.208,00:11:26.375,The drogue is clear.
00:11:28.333,00:11:31.875,"Yeah, I'm coming up on that now. Two, one, mark."
00:11:31.917,00:11:35.083,Seventy-five feet.
00:11:35.125,00:11:36.917,Let's shut down some thrusters on 'em.
00:11:36.959,00:11:39.041,Let's see what he does with this one.
00:11:41.083,00:11:44.792,Whoa. Wait a minute.
00:11:44.834,00:11:48.417,"Houston, we are drifting down and away."
00:11:48.458,00:11:51.291,Do you want to just back off and take another run at this?
00:11:51.333,00:11:54.417,"Let me, uh-- Let me just try and get her stable here."
00:11:54.458,00:11:56.166,"Houston, I'm gonna reset the high-gain."
00:11:56.208,00:11:59.083,I've got that target back in the reticle.
00:11:59.125,00:12:01.458,"Okay, we're stable."
00:12:07.291,00:12:08.291,Twenty.
00:12:09.875,00:12:12.083,"Easy, easy."
00:12:12.125,00:12:13.875,Ten feet.
00:12:16.291,00:12:17.750,Capture.
00:12:17.792,00:12:20.208,Whoo.
00:12:20.250,00:12:23.291,"Sweet move, Ken."
00:12:23.333,00:12:26.250,"Gentlemen, that is the way we do that."
00:12:26.291,00:12:31.125,"Apollo 13 backup crew, you're up in the simulator."
00:12:31.166,00:12:33.000,"Nice job, Jim."
00:12:33.041,00:12:36.583,That's three hours of boredom followed by seven seconds of sheer terror.
00:12:36.625,00:12:39.959,"Good job, guys."
00:12:40.000,00:12:41.959,"Nice try, Frank."
00:12:43.333,00:12:44.959,"You really outfoxed 'em, brother."
00:12:45.000,00:12:47.625,"Yeah, but it wasn't perfect."
00:12:47.667,00:12:49.500,"Ah, you're above the curve."
00:12:49.542,00:12:52.458,"Not by much. Listen, guys, I-- I wanna work it again."
00:12:54.625,00:12:58.500,"Hey. We gotta be up with the dawn patrol headed for Bethpage, at what? 0700?"
00:12:58.542,00:13:00.417,Wheels up at 0700.
00:13:00.458,00:13:03.083,"Yeah, I know."
00:13:03.125,00:13:04.583,I really think we should work it again.
00:13:05.750,00:13:07.291,"Well, let's get it right."
00:13:07.333,00:13:09.583,Okay.
00:13:11.709,00:13:14.208,"Okay, 13 backup crew, it'll have to wait."
00:13:14.250,00:13:15.792,Prime crew's up for another run.
00:13:15.834,00:13:16.834,"Yeah, baby."
00:13:19.375,00:13:23.875,"Apollo 13, we show S4B shutdown and all systems are nominal."
00:13:23.917,00:13:28.917,"Fred, set the S-band omni to B, and when you get in the LEM, to forward."
00:13:28.959,00:13:31.333,Good shape over here.
00:13:32.667,00:13:34.792,"Hey, we got a problem."
00:13:34.834,00:13:36.375,02 flow high!
00:13:36.417,00:13:39.458,no suit pressure.
00:13:39.500,00:13:41.417,I can't get it locked!
00:13:41.458,00:13:43.792,a master alarm! Something just put a big hole in us!
00:13:43.834,00:13:46.625,- We got rapid depress!
00:13:58.709,00:14:00.375,Help!
00:14:11.709,00:14:19.875,"into the sky, something bad would happen, like the stars would fall down on you or something."
00:14:19.917,00:14:22.875,That's silly.
00:14:22.917,00:14:24.834,"Well, you're a smarter kid than I was."
00:14:24.875,00:14:27.375,How long will it take you to get to the moon?
00:14:27.417,00:14:28.458,Four days.
00:14:31.125,00:14:33.375,But that's pretty fast.
00:14:33.417,00:14:43.917,"See, this is the Saturn 4B booster, and it shoots us away from the Earth-- as fast as a bullet from a gun..."
00:14:43.959,00:14:47.208,until the moon's gravity actually grabs us and pulls us...
00:14:48.834,00:14:54.000,"into a circle around the moon, which is called an orbit."
00:14:54.041,00:14:56.333,Right?
00:14:56.375,00:15:00.792,"Fred and I float down the tunnel into this guy, the lunar module, this spidery looking guy."
00:15:00.834,00:15:02.458,Only holds two people.
00:15:02.500,00:15:05.000,And it's just for landing on the moon.
00:15:05.041,00:15:13.834,"And I take the controls, and I steer it around, and I fly it down, adjusting it here, the attitude there, pitch, roll..."
00:15:13.875,00:15:17.750,"for a nice, soft landing on the moon."
00:15:17.792,00:15:20.959,Better than Neil Armstrong.
00:15:24.375,00:15:29.125,"Dad, did you know the astronauts in the fire?"
00:15:32.750,00:15:35.834,"Yeah. Yeah, I did."
00:15:39.750,00:15:41.166,Could that happen again?
00:15:43.333,00:15:45.041,"Well, I tell you something about that fire."
00:15:45.083,00:15:48.333,"Um, a lot of things went wrong."
00:15:50.291,00:15:55.333,"The, uh-- The door-- It's called the hatch."
00:15:55.375,00:15:58.041,They couldn't get it open when they needed to get out.
00:15:58.083,00:15:59.750,That was one thing.
00:15:59.792,00:16:03.834,"And, uh, well, a lot of things went wrong in that fire."
00:16:07.208,00:16:08.583,Did they fix it?
00:16:09.750,00:16:12.041,"Oh, yes, absolutely."
00:16:13.000,00:16:14.333,It's not a problem anymore.
00:16:26.166,00:16:29.125,I can't believe they still have you doing public appearances.
00:16:29.166,00:16:32.917,"Well, Henry Hurt was all over me."
00:16:32.959,00:16:35.000,I know.
00:16:35.041,00:16:37.583,"But, Jim, the training schedule this tight, they shouldn't be asking."
00:16:37.625,00:16:39.709,"Well, the program, you know."
00:16:39.750,00:16:42.333,"Hey! You're Jim Lovell, aren't ya?"
00:16:42.375,00:16:44.417,Hey! Lucky 13!
00:16:45.208,00:16:46.792,Right on!
00:16:55.291,00:16:59.083,That's the second time it's done that.
00:17:07.041,00:17:10.125,"So, I was looking at the kids' school schedule coming up."
00:17:10.166,00:17:12.959,Yeah?
00:17:13.000,00:17:17.417,"Well, yeah."
00:17:21.250,00:17:22.500,Huh.
00:17:23.500,00:17:25.458,"The kids need me at home, honey."
00:17:25.500,00:17:30.125,"Marilyn, we've had these kids for a while now."
00:17:30.166,00:17:32.625,They've never kept you from coming to the other launches.
00:17:32.667,00:17:34.542,"Yes, but now I have your mother."
00:17:32.667,00:17:36.625,"She's just had this stroke-- Ah, no. Mom's fine."
00:17:36.667,00:17:38.792,"Honey, it's not like I've never been to a launch before."
00:17:38.834,00:17:41.750,The other wives have not done three.
00:17:41.792,00:17:45.208,I just-- I just don't think I can go through all that.
00:17:49.667,00:17:52.291,I'll just be glad when this one's over.
00:17:55.375,00:17:57.500,"Well, you're gonna miss a hell of a show."
00:18:06.625,00:18:07.959,Jim!
00:18:08.000,00:18:09.458,Hey Captain.
00:18:09.500,00:18:10.625,Bring us back a moon rock.
00:18:38.291,00:18:40.750,"So, the number 13 doesn't bother you."
00:18:40.792,00:18:42.750,"Only if it's a Friday, Phil."
00:18:42.792,00:18:50.917,"Apollo 13, lifting off at 1300 hours and 13 minutes, and entering the moon's gravity on April 13th."
00:18:50.959,00:18:54.083,"Uh, Ken Mattingly here's been doing some scientific experiments..."
00:18:54.125,00:18:56.083,"regarding that very phenomenon, haven't you?"
00:18:56.125,00:19:01.500,"Uh, oh, yes. Well, I, uh, had a black cat, uh, walk over a broken mirror..."
00:19:01.542,00:19:03.208,under the lunar module ladder.
00:19:03.250,00:19:05.125,It didn't seem to be a problem.
00:19:05.166,00:19:07.417,And we also consider a real helpful letter we got from a fella...
00:19:07.458,00:19:11.667,who said we ought to take a pig up with us for good luck.
00:19:11.709,00:19:15.166,Does it bother you that the public regards this flight as routine?
00:19:15.208,00:19:18.625,There's nothing routine about flying to the moon.
00:19:18.667,00:19:20.917,"And, uh..."
00:19:20.959,00:19:28.500,"I think that an astronaut's last mission, his final flight-- Well, that's-- that's always going to be very special."
00:19:28.542,00:19:31.000,"Why is this your last, Jim?"
00:19:31.041,00:19:35.750,I'm in command of the-- the best ship with the best crew...
00:19:35.792,00:19:38.458,that anybody could ask for.
00:19:38.500,00:19:41.625,And I'll be walking in a place where there's 400 degrees difference...
00:19:41.667,00:19:44.041,between sunlight and shadow.
00:19:45.500,00:19:48.917,"I can't imagine, uh, ever topping that."
00:19:54.917,00:19:57.166,So we have that scheduled for you at 0900 hours tomorrow.
00:19:57.208,00:19:59.375,"Uh, that's not gonna work, Walter."
00:19:59.417,00:20:06.000,"Freddo and I are gonna be going over the lunar surface experiments tomorrow, and Ken's gonna be back in the simulator."
00:20:06.041,00:20:08.125,We're gonna be going over the flight plan tonight as well.
00:20:08.166,00:20:11.792,I'm gonna pay a visit to this beautiful machine after you're hard down. Thanks.
00:20:11.834,00:20:15.250,"Jim, we've got a problem."
00:20:15.291,00:20:17.333,We just got some blood work back from the lab.
00:20:17.375,00:20:19.333,Charlie Duke has the measles.
00:20:20.583,00:20:22.542,So we need a new backup.
00:20:22.583,00:20:24.792,You've all been exposed to it.
00:20:24.834,00:20:26.583,"Well, I've had the measles."
00:20:26.625,00:20:28.834,Ken Mattingly hasn't.
00:20:28.875,00:20:33.083,You-You want to break up my crew two days before the launch.
00:20:33.125,00:20:37.875,"When we can predict each other's moves, when we can read the-- read the tone of each other's voices."
00:20:37.917,00:20:41.333,Ken Mattingly will be getting seriously ill precisely when you and Haise...
00:20:41.375,00:20:43.917,will be ascending from the lunar surface to rendezvous with him.
00:20:43.959,00:20:46.125,"Jim, that's a lousy time for a fever."
00:20:46.166,00:20:48.750,All right. Now look.
00:20:48.792,00:20:51.125,He's fully qualified to fly this mission.
00:20:51.166,00:20:54.417,He's a fine pilot.
00:20:56.125,00:20:58.375,"I'm sorry, Jim."
00:20:58.417,00:21:00.458,Now we can do one of two things here.
00:21:00.500,00:21:05.417,"We can either scrub Mattingly and go with Swigert, or we can bump all three of you to a later mission."
00:21:11.291,00:21:18.417,"I've trained for the Fra Mauro Highlands, and this is flight surgeon horse shit, Deke!"
00:21:18.458,00:21:23.291,"Jim, if you hold out for Ken, you will not be on Apollo 13."
00:21:23.333,00:21:25.667,It's your decision.
00:21:27.709,00:21:31.667,"Oh, let it ring."
00:21:31.709,00:21:34.291,I-I-I gotta take that.
00:21:34.333,00:21:36.375,Because I'm on the backup crew.
00:21:36.417,00:21:41.041,And the backup crew has to set up the guest list and book the hotel room. Swigert.
00:21:41.083,00:21:43.291,Yeah.
00:21:46.208,00:21:49.000,"Yes. Yes, sir."
00:21:49.041,00:21:52.083,I-I understand.
00:22:03.083,00:22:04.667,Ya-hoo!
00:22:16.041,00:22:24.333,"Well, I, uh-- I-- Damn!"
00:22:29.417,00:22:31.125,Medical guys.
00:22:33.375,00:22:45.250,"I had a feeling when they started doing all the blood tests that, uh-- I mean, I know it's their ass if I get sick up there, but I mean, Jesus!"
00:22:59.000,00:23:00.709,"Oh, boy."
00:23:02.208,00:23:03.834,"Swigert, he'll-- he'll be fine."
00:23:03.875,00:23:08.125,"He's, uh-- He's strong."
00:23:12.041,00:23:15.542,It'll be a hell of a mission.
00:23:19.959,00:23:22.959,"You sure about this, Jim?"
00:23:23.000,00:23:24.959,I'm sure we can work this out.
00:23:27.583,00:23:29.041,This was my call.
00:23:40.125,00:23:41.667,Must have been a tough one.
00:23:47.250,00:23:50.083,"Look, I don't have the measles."
00:23:51.500,00:23:53.917,I'm not gonna get the measles.
00:23:57.625,00:23:59.333,"Shit. Ken, wait up!"
00:24:03.917,00:24:08.625,Trajectory's holding steady.
00:24:08.667,00:24:13.959,"Okay, we're into program 64."
00:24:14.000,00:24:20.375,"Uh, Houston, we are at 400,000 feet passing entry interface, about to lose signal."
00:24:20.417,00:24:24.375,Reentry data is nominal and we have radio blackout.
00:24:24.417,00:24:26.333,Do you think he'll get it?
00:24:28.417,00:24:31.083,What's the story here?
00:24:31.125,00:24:33.667,I got a corridor light.
00:24:33.709,00:24:35.083,I'm going to manual.
00:24:40.792,00:24:42.917,"Houston, switching to S.C.S."
00:24:42.959,00:24:44.375,"Roger, 13."
00:24:46.083,00:24:47.667,Five G's.
00:24:49.375,00:24:51.083,We're comin' in too steep.
00:24:51.125,00:24:53.041,I'm gonna stay in this roll.
00:24:54.917,00:24:57.208,We're at eight G's.
00:24:57.250,00:24:59.333,- Nine.
00:24:59.375,00:25:02.125,- Ten.
00:25:02.166,00:25:06.709,- We're at 12 G's.
00:25:07.583,00:25:09.667,Damn it!
00:25:09.709,00:25:12.125,I gave him a false indicator light right at entry interface.
00:25:12.166,00:25:13.959,Even Mattingly didn't get it the first time.
00:25:14.000,00:25:15.834,"How are you feeling, Freddo?"
00:25:16.875,00:25:18.750,Charbroiled.
00:25:22.625,00:25:24.208,So what happened?
00:25:24.250,00:25:26.959,Came in too steep.
00:25:27.000,00:25:29.083,No shit.
00:25:29.125,00:25:41.250,"Yeah. Yeah, we were into program 67 there. So-- Okay, guys, we're gonna do this again, obviously, but, uh, give us a minute to get our switches reset in here."
00:25:41.291,00:25:43.000,"Jim, could we have a word?"
00:25:45.792,00:25:47.166,"Uh, sure, Deke."
00:25:53.625,00:25:56.542,We're gonna drop off-line and debrief this one on our own.
00:25:58.583,00:26:02.500,So?
00:26:02.542,00:26:07.333,"if I had a dollar for every time they killed me in this thing, I'd-- I wouldn't have to work for you, Deke."
00:26:13.125,00:26:15.792,"Well, we have two days."
00:26:15.834,00:26:17.291,Let's do it again.
00:26:19.000,00:26:20.417,Do it again.
00:26:29.500,00:26:31.250,Mom! There he is!
00:26:31.291,00:26:32.875,"Oh, Margaret. Get down."
00:26:32.917,00:26:34.166,"Daddy, we're over here."
00:26:34.208,00:26:40.208,"Watch out, you-- We can't go across that road."
00:26:40.250,00:26:42.166,"and get sick in outer space, right?"
00:26:42.208,00:26:44.417,"Hey, Boys."
00:26:44.458,00:26:46.208,"You're not givin' your mom a hard time, are you?"
00:26:46.250,00:26:48.583,"No, sir."
00:26:51.291,00:26:52.667,Jack!
00:27:11.417,00:27:12.959,"Well, hey!"
00:27:14.417,00:27:16.375,But it can't be.
00:27:16.417,00:27:18.875,I heard it was going to be a hell of a show.
00:27:18.917,00:27:21.834,"- Yeah, who told you that?"
00:27:25.709,00:27:27.083,You can't live without me.
00:27:29.250,00:27:31.625,"Okay, folks."
00:27:31.667,00:27:35.083,We've got a big day tomorrow for these guys.
00:27:35.125,00:27:36.500,You hear about Ken?
00:27:37.667,00:27:39.542,Yeah.
00:27:54.458,00:27:57.667,"One, two."
00:27:57.709,00:27:59.709,"Stand back, please."
00:28:03.375,00:28:07.333,"Ah, Guenter Wendt!"
00:28:07.375,00:28:09.083,Jim.
00:28:09.125,00:28:12.875,"You walk on the moon, huh?"
00:28:12.917,00:28:17.834,"Ja, ja. We walk and-- and we talk on the moon."
00:28:24.125,00:28:25.792,We need a ventilator check-out over here.
00:28:25.834,00:28:27.125,How're you feelin'?
00:28:30.166,00:28:32.083,"It's about to get warmer in here, huh?"
00:28:32.125,00:28:33.709,How are you doing today?
00:28:33.750,00:28:35.000,Ready?
00:28:53.417,00:28:57.000,"Oh! Oh, geez! Oh!"
00:29:00.792,00:29:03.583,"Oh! God, no!"
00:29:07.875,00:29:09.458,"Oh, no."
00:29:11.792,00:29:14.583,"Okay, I'm going to check on this."
00:29:14.625,00:29:17.208,"- Okay, we have the oxygen burn system."
00:29:17.250,00:29:19.250,- We have the helmet restraint ring.
00:29:21.041,00:29:22.709,Okay.
00:29:31.083,00:29:35.333,"Communication umbilical cord and, of course, the ventilation-- Fred."
00:29:35.375,00:29:36.875,Gum.
00:29:39.542,00:29:40.667,Thanks.
00:29:43.250,00:29:45.417,I'm gonna give these guys a beautiful ride.
00:29:45.458,00:29:47.250,"I'm sure you will, Jack."
00:30:01.000,00:30:02.875,You need more air?
00:30:19.041,00:30:20.792,You want some apple?
00:30:20.834,00:30:23.291,"Marilyn, hey."
00:30:23.333,00:30:25.625,"Oh, I hate this already."
00:30:25.667,00:30:27.458,"You're not just about to pop, are you?"
00:30:27.500,00:30:31.083,"No, I got 30 days till this blastoff."
00:31:15.709,00:31:17.208,This is for Gene.
00:31:20.709,00:31:23.917,Mrs. Kranz has pulled out the old needle and thread again.
00:31:23.959,00:31:25.750,The last one looked like he bought it off a gypsy.
00:31:25.792,00:31:28.583,"Well, you can't argue with tradition."
00:31:28.625,00:31:30.250,Copy that.
00:31:30.291,00:31:32.500,"This is from your wife, Gene."
00:31:32.542,00:31:34.583,"Thank you, Tom."
00:31:34.625,00:31:37.917,I was starting to get worried.
00:31:37.959,00:31:39.458,There we go.
00:31:41.208,00:31:43.750,I like it.
00:31:58.125,00:31:59.875,"Jim, you're all set."
00:32:09.333,00:32:11.542,Very sharp.
00:32:11.583,00:32:13.917,"Hey, Gene, I guess we can go now."
00:32:13.959,00:32:16.125,"Save it for the splashdown, guys."
00:32:35.917,00:32:38.583,"Apollo 13 flight controllers, listen up."
00:32:40.125,00:32:42.125,Give me a go-no-go for launch.

00:34:04.333,00:34:07.458,This is it. A few bumps and we're hauling the mail.
00:34:14.458,00:34:17.083,"Control, this is going to be soon. Are there any changes?"
00:34:19.750,00:34:21.625,We are go for launch.

00:35:05.709,00:35:07.041,The clock is running!
00:35:15.166,00:35:17.458,We have liftoff.
00:35:30.959,00:35:35.250,"Houston, we have cleared the tower at 13:13."
00:35:35.291,00:35:37.208,"Okay, guys, we got it."
00:35:51.208,00:35:53.041,"Come on, baby."
00:35:57.291,00:35:59.458,Altitude.
00:36:00.792,00:36:03.792,Velocity right on the line.
00:36:03.834,00:36:05.959,Roll complete.
00:36:06.000,00:36:09.959,"Thirteen, stand by for mode one bravo."
00:36:14.125,00:36:15.500,"FIDO, how we lookin'?"
00:36:17.500,00:36:19.250,"Looks good, Flight."
00:36:21.041,00:36:24.542,We see your B.P.C.
00:36:24.583,00:36:26.792,"Uh, Roger."
00:36:28.625,00:36:29.917,Inboard.
00:36:29.959,00:36:32.959,"Get ready for a little jolt, fellas."
00:36:46.375,00:36:47.709,That was some little jolt.
00:36:53.667,00:36:55.667,Tower jett.
00:37:05.500,00:37:08.625,"Houston, this is 13."
00:37:12.834,00:37:15.375,"Roger that, 13."
00:37:15.417,00:37:17.458,"Booster, can you confirm that center engine cutoff?"
00:37:17.500,00:37:19.250,"Roger that, Flight."
00:37:19.291,00:37:20.667,"FIDO, what's that gonna do to us?"
00:37:20.709,00:37:22.500,"Stand by, Flight."
00:37:22.542,00:37:24.959,I need to know if the I.U.'s correcting for the number five shutdown.
00:37:34.792,00:37:37.041,"Houston, what's the story on engine five?"
00:37:38.083,00:37:39.500,Guidance is good.
00:37:39.542,00:37:41.792,Looks good.
00:37:41.834,00:37:45.166,"- We'll be all right, as long as we don't lose another one."
00:37:45.208,00:37:49.166,"Uh, 13, uh, we're not sure why the inboard was out early, but the other engines are a go."
00:37:49.208,00:37:52.875,So we're just gonna burn those remaining engines for a little bit longer.
00:37:52.917,00:37:54.041,Roger that.
00:37:54.083,00:37:55.542,Our gimbals are good.
00:37:55.583,00:37:57.166,Our trim is good.
00:38:01.291,00:38:03.041,Looks like we just had our glitch for this mission.
00:38:13.583,00:38:16.458,"Thirteen, stand by for staging."
00:38:17.458,00:38:21.083,S2 shutdown.
00:38:21.125,00:38:22.834,"Thrust looks good, Flight."
00:38:24.709,00:38:27.208,"Flight, S4B cutoff in 10 seconds."
00:38:27.250,00:38:31.291,"13, this is Houston."
00:38:32.458,00:38:35.583,"Coming up on 12 minutes, 34."
00:38:37.542,00:38:40.208,- And-- - SECO!
00:38:42.041,00:38:44.125,Shutdown.
00:38:44.166,00:38:47.333,"And that, gentlemen, is how we do that."
00:39:13.667,00:39:16.000,"Oh, boy. Hope I can sleep."
00:39:16.041,00:39:17.625,"Mom, that was loud."
00:39:17.667,00:39:19.458,Here. Hold my hand.
00:39:20.750,00:39:23.291,I can't believe you did this four times.
00:39:23.333,00:39:25.375,The worst part's over.
00:39:26.667,00:39:31.875,"Listen, this doesn't stop for me until he lands on that aircraft carrier."
00:39:31.917,00:39:34.583,"Oh, you just look so calm about it."
00:39:34.625,00:39:38.291,"Well, if the flight surgeon had to okay me for this mission, I'd be grounded."
00:39:38.333,00:39:39.709,Mrs. Lovell! Mrs. Haise!
00:39:39.750,00:39:41.750,Please! Can we speak to you a minute?
00:39:41.792,00:39:44.500,- Can we have a word with you?
00:39:44.542,00:39:47.959,"Remember, you're proud, happy and..."
00:39:48.000,00:39:49.709,How are you feeling?
00:39:49.750,00:39:52.291,"We're very proud and very happy, and we're thrilled."
00:39:56.834,00:39:59.250,"Flight, Booster."
00:39:59.291,00:40:02.625,T.L.I. is on the money.
00:40:02.667,00:40:04.083,"Roger, FIDO."
00:40:05.709,00:40:09.709,"Okay, guys."
00:40:09.750,00:40:12.166,"Flight, we have reacquisition of signal at Hawaii."
00:40:12.208,00:40:14.250,Everything looks good as can be.
00:40:15.834,00:40:18.000,"Okay, uh, Houston. C.M.P. here."
00:40:18.041,00:40:20.875,I've exchanged couches with Jim.
00:40:20.917,00:40:25.750,"I'm, uh, gonna go ahead and get set for transposition and docking."
00:40:25.792,00:40:27.959,"Roger that, Jack."
00:40:39.667,00:40:42.250,"- Fred, are you okay?"
00:40:45.792,00:40:50.000,"Okay, everybody, let's get turned around and pick up the lunar module."
00:40:50.041,00:40:51.875,"Odyssey, you're go for pyro arm and docking."
00:40:51.917,00:40:55.709,Repeat: Go for docking.
00:40:56.875,00:40:58.792,Roger that.
00:40:58.834,00:41:02.000,"Okay, we're ready for C.S.M. separation."
00:41:04.583,00:41:08.500,"Okay, S.M.R.C.S isol valves are all gray."
00:41:08.542,00:41:12.250,"Okay, Swigert, command module pilot, she's all yours."
00:41:18.083,00:41:19.875,"Houston, we've got a good separation."
00:41:19.917,00:41:21.417,"Odyssey, the S4B is stable."
00:41:21.458,00:41:22.959,Translation looks good.
00:41:23.000,00:41:24.834,"We confirm that, 13."
00:41:24.875,00:41:28.083,"Okay. We're gonna start to pitch around, to line up with the LEM."
00:41:28.125,00:41:33.417,"You know, Freddo, Frank Borman was upchucking most of the way to the moon on Apollo 8."
00:41:33.458,00:41:36.875,I'm all right.
00:41:38.417,00:41:40.542,And pitching up.
00:41:40.583,00:41:44.208,"Pitch rate, 2.5 degrees per second."
00:41:44.250,00:41:45.834,"Roger, Jack, uh..."
00:41:45.875,00:41:48.125,we see you pitching around.
00:41:48.166,00:41:50.750,Keep an eye on that telemetry.
00:41:50.792,00:41:52.959,"If Swigert can't dock this thing, we don't have a mission."
00:41:55.667,00:41:57.458,- How's the alignment?
00:42:03.208,00:42:04.333,Thrusting forward.
00:42:07.125,00:42:08.458,One hundred feet.
00:42:14.083,00:42:15.125,Watch the alignment now.
00:42:23.667,00:42:25.875,"Hey, don't worry, guys."
00:42:25.917,00:42:28.125,I'm on top of it.
00:42:32.542,00:42:35.709,know when you're ready.
00:42:37.792,00:42:40.000,"How we lookin', Freddo?"
00:42:42.625,00:42:43.625,Twenty.
00:42:48.291,00:42:50.417,"Come on, rookie, park that thing."
00:42:57.083,00:42:58.083,Ten feet.
00:43:09.375,00:43:11.917,- Capture.
00:43:11.959,00:43:13.917,Talk back is barber poled.
00:43:13.959,00:43:15.542,Go ahead and retract.
00:43:18.959,00:43:21.458,"Houston, we have hard dock."
00:43:21.500,00:43:24.709,Roger. Understand.
00:43:24.750,00:43:27.041,"Okay, let's start back up with procedure 17."
00:43:28.750,00:43:31.834,"Okay, Houston, we have LEM extraction."
00:43:31.875,00:43:35.250,Now you're off to the Fra Mauro Highlands.
00:43:35.291,00:43:37.166,I gotta get out of this suit.
00:43:37.208,00:43:41.750,"Uh, Houston, uh, we are ready, for the uh, beginning of the P.T.C."
00:43:41.792,00:43:45.750,"And I think once we're in that barbecue roll, uh, Jack and I will eat."
00:43:45.792,00:43:48.750,"Hey, I'm hungry."
00:43:48.792,00:43:51.834,I could eat the ass out of a dead rhinoceros.
00:43:55.583,00:43:57.458,"We got a smooth one, huh?"
00:43:57.500,00:44:00.458,By the numbers so far.
00:44:00.500,00:44:03.333,"Everything-- Oh, let me clean this up for you."
00:44:03.375,00:44:05.834,See you tomorrow.
00:44:20.125,00:44:23.625,"Oh, it's too bad we can't demonstrate this on TV."
00:44:23.667,00:44:25.625,What a shame.
00:44:30.917,00:44:33.417,"Okay, overboard dump comin' up."
00:44:37.333,00:44:40.959,"Here it comes, the constellation Urine."
00:44:45.333,00:44:47.417,Now that's a beautiful sight.
00:44:47.458,00:44:51.291,"Barbara. Barbara, we are going to your father's broadcast."
00:44:51.333,00:44:54.333,No! I'm never coming out.
00:44:54.375,00:44:58.792,I hate Paul! No one else can ever play another one of their records again!
00:44:58.834,00:45:01.709,She's still going on about the stupid Beatles breaking up?
00:45:01.750,00:45:03.750,They're not stupid.
00:45:03.792,00:45:07.000,"Barbara, I know you're in mourning."
00:45:07.041,00:45:08.959,Dad won't even know if we're there.
00:45:09.000,00:45:13.500,"The whole world is going to be watching this broadcast, young lady. And so are we."
00:45:16.000,00:45:21.208,"Okay. Uh, good evening, uh, America, and welcome aboard Apollo 13."
00:45:22.375,00:45:26.917,"I'm Jim Lovell and, uh, we're broadcasting to you tonight from an altitude..."
00:45:26.959,00:45:35.709,"of almost 200,000 miles away from the face of the Earth, and we have a pretty good show in store for you tonight."
00:45:35.750,00:45:39.417,"- We are going to show you just what uh, life is like..."
00:45:39.458,00:45:43.917,for the three of us here in the vast expanse of outer space.
00:45:43.959,00:45:46.959,"- Okay, one of the first things we'd like to do is..."
00:45:47.000,00:45:50.000,provide you with the appropriate background music.
00:45:51.583,00:45:54.000,"So, uh, hit it there, Freddo."
00:45:54.041,00:45:57.208,"Hello, world!"
00:46:09.959,00:46:20.000,"That, uh, was suppose to be the theme to 2001 in honor of our command module Odyssey, but there seems to have been a last-minute change in the program."
00:46:20.041,00:46:24.375,"When I go up there on 19, I'm gonna take my entire collection of Johnny Cash along."
00:46:28.625,00:46:30.417,"Hey, Marilyn."
00:46:32.250,00:46:34.709,All the networks dumped us.
00:46:34.750,00:46:38.875,One of them said we made going to the moon about as exciting as taking a trip to Pittsburgh.
00:46:40.875,00:46:45.083,My son's suppose to be on.
00:46:47.333,00:46:50.000,"This is all the channels we get, Mrs. Lovell."
00:46:51.583,00:46:54.417,It's that damn TV Guide again.
00:46:54.458,00:47:14.125,"...ruthless corners, savage baggage masters-- Do they know they're not on the air?"
00:47:15.917,00:47:20.000,We'll tell them when they get back.
00:47:22.000,00:47:33.875,"Oh, well, if anyone from the, uh, from the I.R.S. is watching, I forgot to file my-my-my 1040 return, and then I meant to do it today, but, uh-- That's no joke."
00:47:36.375,00:47:40.000,"Well, folks, let's head on down to the lunar excursion module."
00:47:40.041,00:47:41.500,Follow me.
00:47:41.542,00:47:48.125,"Now when we get ready to land on the moon, Fred Haise and I will float through this access tunnel..."
00:47:48.166,00:47:54.917,"into the lunar module, leaving-- EECOM, that-that stir's gonna be on, uh, both H2..."
00:47:54.959,00:47:57.125,and both 02 tanks.
00:47:57.166,00:47:59.125,...spacecraft will remain connected.
00:48:02.041,00:48:08.041,"Well, folks, as, uh, you can probably tell, the Aquarius isn't much bigger than a couple of telephone booths."
00:48:08.083,00:48:16.250,"The, uh, skin of the LEM in some places is only as-- as thick as a couple of, uh, layers of tin foil."
00:48:16.291,00:48:18.875,And that's all that protects us from the vacuum of space.
00:48:18.917,00:48:21.834,We can get away with this because the LEM is designed only...
00:48:21.875,00:48:24.041,for flight in outer space.
00:48:24.083,00:48:25.125,Fred Haise...
00:48:25.166,00:48:28.500,Renaissance man.
00:48:28.542,00:48:32.458,"Okay, uh, we'll head back up the, uh, tunnel now and back into the Odyssey."
00:48:38.583,00:48:43.208,"All right, uh, we've returned to the command-- Stand by one, Houston."
00:48:44.583,00:48:47.208,Gotcha.
00:48:47.250,00:48:51.125,"Uh, Houston, that bang you heard was Fred Haise on the cabin repress valve."
00:48:51.166,00:48:53.917,He really gets our hearts going every time with that one.
00:48:57.083,00:49:01.750,"Okay, we're, uh-- we're about to close out the Aquarius..."
00:49:01.792,00:49:04.583,"and, uh, return to the Odyssey."
00:49:04.625,00:49:09.083,Our next broadcast will be from Fra Mauro on the surface of the moon.
00:49:11.291,00:49:19.834,"So, uh, this is the crew of the Apollo 13 wishing everyone back on Earth, uh, a pleasant evening."
00:49:24.500,00:49:26.834,All right.
00:49:28.041,00:49:30.333,Daddy was funny.
00:49:30.375,00:49:33.000,"You know, they might air a few minutes of it on the news tonight."
00:49:33.041,00:49:34.417,You'd think so.
00:49:36.333,00:49:38.208,Bye.
00:49:38.250,00:49:46.917,"Well, between Jack's back taxes and The Fred Haise Show, I'd say that was a pretty successful broadcast."
00:49:46.959,00:49:49.875,"- That was an excellent show, Odyssey."
00:49:49.917,00:49:52.500,"Uh, we got a couple of housekeeping procedures for you."
00:49:52.542,00:49:56.959,We'd like you to roll right to 0-6-0 and null your rates.
00:49:57.000,00:50:00.625,Roger that.
00:50:05.000,00:50:08.583,"And then if you could, uh, give your oxygen tanks a stir."
00:50:09.542,00:50:10.542,Roger that.
00:50:44.542,00:50:45.959,"Hey, we've got a problem here."
00:50:47.917,00:50:49.792,What did you do?
00:50:49.834,00:50:52.250,Whoa!
00:50:55.750,00:50:58.375,"Uh, this is Houston."
00:50:58.417,00:50:59.750,"Houston, we have a problem."
00:51:01.959,00:51:05.834,We have a main bus B undervolt.
00:51:05.875,00:51:08.417,- What's the story with the computer now?
00:51:08.458,00:51:11.333,"Oh, there's another master alarm, Houston."
00:51:11.375,00:51:13.375,I'm checking the quad.
00:51:13.417,00:51:15.375,Maybe it's in quad C.
00:51:15.417,00:51:18.583,- I'm gonna reconfigure the R.C.S.
00:51:18.625,00:51:21.959,"We've got multiple cautions and warnings, Houston."
00:51:22.000,00:51:23.250,All right. I'm going to S.C.S.
00:51:26.417,00:51:29.333,Jesus.
00:51:29.375,00:51:31.125,"EECOM, what's your data telling you?"
00:51:31.166,00:51:33.417,"Uh, 02 tank two not reading at all."
00:51:33.458,00:51:36.750,"Tank one is at, uh, 725 psi and falling."
00:51:36.792,00:51:43.083,"Fuel cells one and three are, uh-- Oh, boy. What's goin' on here?"
00:51:43.125,00:51:45.458,"Flight, G.N.C."
00:51:45.500,00:51:47.917,"Flight, they're all over the place. They keep yawing close to gimbal lock."
00:51:47.959,00:51:55.583,"I-I keep losing radio signal, Flight. Their antenna-- One at a time, people."
00:51:55.625,00:51:59.291,"EECOM, is this an instrumentation problem, or are we looking at real power loss here?"
00:51:59.333,00:52:02.041,It's-It's reading a quadruple failure.
00:52:02.083,00:52:03.834,It's-It's got to be instrumentation.
00:52:03.875,00:52:06.750,Let's get that hatch buttoned.
00:52:06.792,00:52:11.000,And the tunnel's really torquing with all this movement.
00:52:11.041,00:52:14.291,"Uh, Houston, we had a pretty large bang there associated with a master alarm."
00:52:14.333,00:52:17.917,"Shit, it's main bus A."
00:52:17.959,00:52:22.750,"Houston, we have a main bus A undervolt now too."
00:52:22.792,00:52:27.166,"Main bus B is reading zip right now. Uh, we got a wicked shimmy up here."
00:52:27.208,00:52:30.166,"EECOM, G.N.C., these guys are talking about bangs and shimmies up there."
00:52:30.208,00:52:32.000,That doesn't sound like instrumentation to me.
00:52:32.041,00:52:34.792,"- You are breaking up, 13."
00:52:34.834,00:52:37.083,Just-- Just stow it.
00:52:37.125,00:52:39.625,"If we'd been hit by a meteor, we'd be dead by now."
00:52:39.667,00:52:41.291,I'm gonna try to get us out of this lurch.
00:52:41.333,00:52:44.083,"Uh, Houston, you're in the mud."
00:52:44.125,00:52:47.166,"- Roger that, 13."
00:52:47.208,00:52:49.041,"Hey, it's fighting me."
00:52:49.083,00:52:51.166,We keep flirting with gimbal lock.
00:52:51.208,00:52:54.125,"Odyssey, we need a confirmation."
00:52:56.291,00:52:59.208,"Okay, Jim."
00:52:59.250,00:53:01.375,Did you say switch to omni Charlie?
00:53:01.417,00:53:04.375,"Houston, I'm switching over quad C to main A."
00:53:04.417,00:53:07.208,"- Roger that, 13."
00:53:07.250,00:53:09.250,Fuel cell three.
00:53:09.291,00:53:13.083,"We got a main bus B undervolt, cryo pressure, suit compressor."
00:53:13.125,00:53:15.083,What don't we have?
00:53:15.125,00:53:19.959,A.C. bus one. A.C. bus two.
00:53:20.000,00:53:23.041,And 02 flow high.
00:53:23.083,00:53:24.750,Maybe this is a caution and warning failure.
00:53:24.792,00:53:28.959,"Houston, we are venting something out into space."
00:53:30.750,00:53:34.458,I can see it outside of window one right now.
00:53:35.750,00:53:39.959,"It's definitely, uh, a gas of some sort."
00:53:42.166,00:53:43.458,It's gotta be the oxygen.
00:54:02.709,00:54:04.542,"Roger, Odyssey, we copy you're venting."
00:54:08.417,00:54:11.125,"Okay, now, let's start right back on the beginning."
00:54:23.417,00:54:25.625,"Okay, listen up."
00:54:28.166,00:54:30.625,Quiet down.
00:54:30.667,00:54:32.709,"Let's stay cool, people."
00:54:32.750,00:54:35.542,"Procedures, I need another computer up in the R.T.C.C."
00:54:35.583,00:54:38.125,I want everybody to alert your support teams.
00:54:38.166,00:54:41.125,Wake up anybody you need.
00:54:41.166,00:54:43.458,"Let's work the problem, people."
00:54:43.500,00:54:45.709,Let's not make things worse by guessin'.
00:54:45.750,00:54:48.208,"Thirteen, this is Houston."
00:54:48.250,00:54:50.166,We are gonna get you some answers.
00:54:50.208,00:54:54.166,"I tell you, we keep venting like this, we're gonna keep hitting the edge of that deadband."
00:54:54.208,00:54:55.917,"Hey, take a look at the 02 on number one."
00:55:00.750,00:55:03.917,200 pounds and falling.
00:55:03.959,00:55:08.542,02 tank two still zero.
00:55:08.583,00:55:09.959,Is that what you're gettin'?
00:55:10.000,00:55:13.291,"Uh, we're seeing the same, 13."
00:55:13.333,00:55:18.875,"Can we review our status here, Sy? Let's look at this thing from a, uh-- from a, uh, standpoint of status."
00:55:18.917,00:55:25.166,Uh-- What do we got on the spacecraft that's good?
00:55:28.000,00:55:30.000,"I'll get back to you, Gene."
00:55:32.375,00:55:35.250,We're not going to have power much longer.
00:55:35.291,00:55:37.875,The ship's bleedin' to death.
00:55:45.375,00:55:48.375,Flight?
00:55:48.417,00:55:51.625,"Um, Flight, I recommend we, uh, shut down the reactant valves of the fuel cells."
00:55:53.625,00:55:56.834,What the hell good is that gonna do?
00:55:56.875,00:55:58.834,"If that's where the leak is, we can isolate it."
00:55:58.875,00:56:02.458,"We can isolate it there, and we can save what's left in the tanks, and we can run on the good cell."
00:56:02.500,00:56:03.834,"You close 'em, you can't open 'em again."
00:56:03.875,00:56:05.542,You can't land on the moon with one healthy fuel cell.
00:56:07.959,00:56:11.166,"Gene, the Odyssey is dying."
00:56:11.208,00:56:13.083,"From my chair here, this is the last option."
00:56:21.792,00:56:24.125,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:56:39.667,00:56:41.125,"CAPCOM, let's have them close the reactant valves."
00:56:43.041,00:56:46.500,"Thirteen, this is Houston."
00:56:46.542,00:56:48.417,on cells one and three.
00:56:48.458,00:56:49.834,Do you copy?
00:56:52.125,00:56:54.750,Are you saying you want the whole smash?
00:56:54.792,00:56:59.000,Closing down the react valves for fuel cells shut down?
00:56:59.041,00:57:02.083,"Shutting down the fuel cells, did I hear you right?"
00:57:02.959,00:57:04.834,"Yeah, they heard me right."
00:57:06.709,00:57:08.959,Tell them we think that's the only way they could stop the leak.
00:57:09.000,00:57:14.375,"Yeah, Jim, uh, we think that closing the react valves may stop the leak."
00:57:24.500,00:57:27.041,- Did he copy that?
00:57:29.333,00:57:30.875,"Yes, Houston, we copy."
00:57:36.875,00:57:38.458,We just lost the moon.
00:57:48.625,00:57:50.041,"Okay, Freddo, shut those down."
00:57:53.083,00:57:54.583,Let's see what this does.
00:58:02.709,00:58:07.709,"If this doesn't work, we're not gonna have enough power left to get home."
00:58:25.750,00:58:27.208,Shit!
00:58:27.250,00:58:28.583,Goddamn it!
00:58:28.625,00:58:31.625,"Uh, Houston, uh, 02 on one is still falling."
00:58:35.333,00:58:37.125,"Freddo, how long does it take to power up the LEM?"
00:58:37.166,00:58:39.125,Three hours by the checklist.
00:58:40.458,00:58:41.709,We don't have that much time.
00:58:42.583,00:58:43.875,Shit!
00:58:45.125,00:58:54.375,"Okay, now, Jack, before the batteries completely die on us in here, let's, uh-- let's power down everything so we can save as much as we can for reentry."
00:58:54.417,00:58:58.083,"Fifteen minutes of oxygen, and that's it."
00:58:58.125,00:58:59.583,Okay.
00:58:59.625,00:59:01.417,"Okay, guys, listen up."
00:59:01.458,00:59:03.375,We're moving the astronauts over to the LEM.
00:59:03.417,00:59:05.750,We gotta get some oxygen up there.
00:59:05.792,00:59:09.792,"TELMU, Control, I want an emergency power procedure, the essential hardware only."
00:59:09.834,00:59:13.834,"G.N.C., EECOM, we're gonna be shutting down the command module at the same time."
00:59:13.875,00:59:16.166,We'll have to transfer the guidance system from one computer to the other.
00:59:16.208,00:59:19.166,So I want those numbers up and ready when our guys are in position.
00:59:19.208,00:59:22.250,"Okay, we gotta transfer all control data over to the LEM computer..."
00:59:22.291,00:59:25.250,before the command module dies.
00:59:26.417,00:59:27.959,"Odyssey, uh, this is Houston."
00:59:28.000,00:59:30.041,"Uh, we need you to power down immediately."
00:59:30.083,00:59:32.667,And you're gonna have to power up the LEM at the same time.
00:59:32.709,00:59:34.166,So you better get somebody over there.
00:59:34.208,00:59:36.709,"We already have Freddo in the LEM, Houston."
00:59:36.750,00:59:39.083,"We've got serious time pressure here, Jim."
00:59:39.125,00:59:46.792,"You've got to get the guidance program transferred, and you've got to do it before you're out of power in the command module, or you're not gonna be able to navigate up there."
00:59:46.834,00:59:48.709,How much time?
00:59:48.750,00:59:52.417,"Well, we're lookin' at less than 15 minutes of life support in the Odyssey."
00:59:56.834,00:59:58.917,"We got 15 minutes, Freddo."
01:00:02.125,01:00:05.291,be aware I've moved from the command module into the LEM.
01:00:06.875,01:00:09.041,Now if Jack can't get that guidance computer data...
01:00:09.083,01:00:12.250,transferred before they go dead in there-- They won't even know which way they're pointed.
01:00:12.291,01:00:13.959,That's right.
01:00:14.000,01:00:15.333,I'll be in 210 if you need me.
01:00:17.125,01:00:19.000,"Houston, this is 13."
01:00:19.041,01:00:21.208,"Are you, uh-- Are you back with me now?"
01:00:22.542,01:00:24.125,"Aquarius, this is Houston."
01:00:24.166,01:00:26.333,You now have about 12 minutes to power up.
01:00:26.375,01:00:28.500,I can't see any stars.
01:00:28.542,01:00:30.333,"Man, there's a lot of debris floating around out there."
01:00:32.417,01:00:35.000,"Okay, Houston, I've completed the steps on page 15."
01:00:35.041,01:00:36.500,Now I'm ready to power down the computer.
01:00:38.333,01:00:43.125,"I'm gonna need your gimbal angles, Jack, before you shut down the computer!"
01:00:43.166,01:00:44.542,"Okay, Jim."
01:00:44.583,01:00:46.917,I need this back to me before they power down.
01:00:46.959,01:00:48.583,"All right, all right."
01:00:50.083,01:00:51.917,"Houston, our computer is up."
01:00:51.959,01:00:54.583,Roger that.
01:00:54.625,01:00:58.917,"Now, Jack, we need to proceed with steps 12 through 17 quickly."
01:00:58.959,01:01:02.125,"You're down to, uh, about eight minutes remaining."
01:01:02.166,01:01:05.709,"Okay, fuel cell pump's off."
01:01:05.750,01:01:07.917,"Okay, uh, Houston, check me."
01:01:07.959,01:01:13.041,"I've, uh, completed these gimbal conversions, but, uh-- I need a double check of the arithmetic."
01:01:13.083,01:01:14.500,"Yeah, you can go, Jim."
01:01:14.542,01:01:17.500,"Okay, the roll CAL angle is minus two."
01:01:17.542,01:01:21.709,Lunar module roll is 355.57.
01:01:21.750,01:01:28.041,Pitch. 1678.
01:01:28.083,01:01:30.458,Yaw is 351.87.
01:01:30.500,01:01:32.125,Stand by.
01:01:32.166,01:01:39.250,"We've got negative visibility in our star field, and if this paperwork isn't right, who knows where we'll-- we'll end up out here."
01:01:46.208,01:01:47.917,"Looks good, Flight."
01:01:47.959,01:01:50.125,It's all right.
01:01:50.166,01:01:52.542,"- He's good, Andy."
01:01:52.583,01:01:54.583,You're good.
01:01:54.625,01:01:56.959,"Jack, turn off the I.M.U."
01:01:57.000,01:01:59.625,Stand by-- Over.
01:01:59.667,01:02:01.208,"It's a great day in New York, isn't it?"
01:02:01.250,01:02:03.417,It's girl watcher's weather.
01:02:03.458,01:02:06.166,I like those ingenious girl watchers who put on Con Edison helmets...
01:02:06.208,01:02:10.291,and dig trenches in the street to get a-- a better view.
01:02:10.333,01:02:15.709,"Hey, speaking of girl watching things, do you know that our first bachelor astronaut is on his way to the moon?"
01:02:15.750,01:02:17.625,- Is it Swigert?
01:02:17.667,01:02:20.792,"Yeah. First bachelor that-- He's the kind, they say, has a girl in every port."
01:02:20.834,01:02:23.083,He has that reputation.
01:02:23.125,01:02:30.250,"I think he's sort of foolishly optimistic, though, taking nylons and Hershey bars to the moon anyway."
01:02:30.291,01:02:32.333,Did you read that three million-- What do you say?
01:02:32.375,01:02:37.208,Less viewers or fewer viewers?
01:02:32.375,01:02:40.917,"Three million fewer viewers, uh-- Three million fewer viewers watch the, uh, space shot than did the last one."
01:02:40.959,01:02:49.959,"Uh, I talk-- uh, um, Colonel, uh, Borman this evening-- At ABC News-- Here is ABC science editor, Jules Bergman."
01:02:50.000,01:02:56.000,"The Apollo 13 spacecraft has lost all electrical power, and astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert..."
01:02:56.041,01:02:57.917,are making their way through the tunnel...
01:02:57.959,01:03:00.041,"to the lunar module, using it as a lifeboat..."
01:03:00.083,01:03:03.917,so they'll have electrical power for their radios on the command module.
01:03:03.959,01:03:10.041,Apollo 13 is apparently also losing breathing oxygen and the astronauts may have-- Slow down.
01:03:10.083,01:03:13.125,The emergency has ruled out any chance of a lunar landing...
01:03:13.166,01:03:22.709,"and could endanger the lives of the astronauts themselves, if the LEM oxygen supply, plus whatever is left of the command module's oxygen, can't last them until they can get back to Earth."
01:03:22.750,01:03:24.750,What do you mean there's no immediate danger?
01:03:24.792,01:03:27.458,I-I just heard they're losing oxygen.
01:03:27.500,01:03:31.166,...the LEM's descent rocket engine will be used in aborting the mission...
01:03:31.208,01:03:33.834,and getting the astronauts safely back to Earth.
01:03:33.875,01:03:38.417,"Recapping what has happened now, the Apollo 13 astronauts may be in grave danger."
01:03:38.458,01:03:42.583,"No, don't give me that NASA bullshit! I want to know what's happening with my husband!"
01:03:42.625,01:03:44.792,"All right, we want to switch control to the Aquarius now."
01:03:44.834,01:03:46.750,- Roger that.
01:03:46.792,01:03:49.083,"And you're down to about five minutes now, Jack."
01:03:49.125,01:03:52.792,- Whoa! The R.C.S. isn't up yet.
01:03:52.834,01:03:54.625,We have no attitude control on Aquarius.
01:03:55.542,01:03:57.250,They don't have control?
01:03:57.291,01:04:00.542,Did we miss a step here?
01:04:00.583,01:04:03.500,I don't know.
01:04:06.291,01:04:07.875,"Fred, we're all out of whack."
01:04:07.917,01:04:10.125,"Trying to pitch it down, but we're yaw to the left."
01:04:10.166,01:04:12.083,Why can't I null this out?
01:04:12.125,01:04:13.709,She wasn't designed to fly attached like this.
01:04:13.750,01:04:16.208,Our center of gravity's the command module.
01:04:16.250,01:04:19.125,It's like flying with a dead elephant on our back.
01:04:19.166,01:04:21.959,"Flight, Guidance. We're getting awfully close to center here."
01:04:22.000,01:04:23.250,"Aquarius, watch that middle gimbal."
01:04:23.291,01:04:24.959,We don't want you tumbling off into space.
01:04:25.000,01:04:27.917,"Freddo, inform Houston we're well aware of the goddamn gimbals."
01:04:29.166,01:04:30.625,"Roger that, Houston."
01:04:30.667,01:04:32.625,I don't need to hear the obvious.
01:04:32.667,01:04:35.250,I got the frappin' eight-ball right in front of me.
01:04:35.291,01:04:38.125,"Aquarius, uh, this is Houston."
01:04:38.166,01:04:40.500,You want what?
01:04:40.542,01:04:45.000,- You have a hot mike. We are readin' everything you say.
01:04:47.083,01:04:50.166,And it's only by a very narrow margin that we're going to get...
01:04:50.208,01:04:53.166,"Lovell, Haise and Swigert back alive."
01:04:53.208,01:04:54.792,Marilyn?
01:04:54.834,01:04:59.166,"The issue has been very close, not so much delineated by-- I'm sorry."
01:04:59.208,01:05:03.417,...by the terseness of Kraft and the grim lines of Jim McDivitt.
01:05:03.458,01:05:07.625,"This has been a very close call, and we're not out of the woods yet, not by a long shot."
01:05:12.166,01:05:13.792,Jeffrey?
01:05:15.208,01:05:17.291,Why are so many people here?
01:05:18.917,01:05:23.333,"Oh. Well, you know, your-- your dad's flying his mission."
01:05:26.250,01:05:28.458,He said he was going to get me a moon rock.
01:05:28.500,01:05:30.625,Right.
01:05:32.542,01:05:34.125,Well...
01:05:36.625,01:05:41.166,something broke on your daddy's spaceship.
01:05:41.208,01:05:44.333,And he's gonna have to turn around before he even gets to the moon.
01:05:49.125,01:05:50.834,Was it the door?
01:05:52.792,01:05:56.166,"Thirteen, Houston."
01:05:56.208,01:05:58.709,How're you doin'?
01:05:58.750,01:06:01.000,we've had to learn how to fly all over again.
01:06:01.041,01:06:03.625,"But, uh, we are doing better up here now."
01:06:03.667,01:06:06.166,"Uh, roger that, Aquarius."
01:06:06.208,01:06:07.834,Have him close it out.
01:06:07.875,01:06:12.041,"Jack, uh, we can close out your procedure now."
01:06:12.083,01:06:16.625,"Now, do we know for sure that we can power this thing back up?"
01:06:16.667,01:06:19.625,"Uh, it's gonna get awfully cold in here."
01:06:19.667,01:06:23.834,"Copy that, Jack."
01:06:27.250,01:06:28.500,Computer off.
01:06:29.625,01:06:30.625,We're go on the LEM.
01:06:32.500,01:06:34.458,"We confirm shutdown, Jack."
01:06:34.500,01:06:36.709,Lunar module now in control.
01:06:41.959,01:06:46.542,"Roger that, Houston."
01:07:02.417,01:07:04.959,"Freddo, we're gonna have to execute some sort of a burn here."
01:07:05.041,01:07:06.750,It's just a matter of when.
01:07:11.250,01:07:13.500,Did they shut us all down in there?
01:07:13.542,01:07:15.291,Yeah.
01:07:15.333,01:07:18.417,Didn't think we'd be back in here so soon.
01:07:20.750,01:07:24.750,"Uh, Houston, how far off course do you project we are? Over."
01:07:27.667,01:07:29.834,"Okay, people."
01:07:29.875,01:07:33.250,"Gentlemen, I want you all to forget the flight plan."
01:07:33.291,01:07:36.583,From this moment on we are improvising a new mission.
01:07:39.166,01:07:41.291,"Oh, come on."
01:07:41.333,01:07:43.375,We'll get somebody to look at that.
01:07:43.417,01:07:45.333,How do we get our people home?
01:07:48.250,01:07:50.542,They are here.
01:07:50.583,01:07:51.875,Yes!
01:07:55.709,01:07:57.291,"No, sir. No, sir."
01:07:57.333,01:07:59.834,We get them on a free-return trajectory.
01:07:59.875,01:08:02.041,It's the option with the fewest question marks for safety.
01:08:02.083,01:08:05.458,I agree with Jerry.
01:08:05.500,01:08:09.125,"No, the LEM will not support three guys for that amount of time."
01:08:09.166,01:08:11.750,"- I mean, we have got to do a direct abort."
01:08:11.792,01:08:13.959,We do an about-face.
01:08:14.000,01:08:15.750,Get 'em back soon.
01:08:15.792,01:08:18.250,No. We don't even know if the Odyssey's engine's even workin'.
01:08:18.291,01:08:21.792,And if there's been serious damage to this spacecraft-- They blow up and they die!
01:08:21.834,01:08:24.250,That is not the argument!
01:08:21.834,01:08:27.583,"We are talking about time, not whether or not these guys-- Come on! I'm not gonna sugarcoat this for you!"
01:08:27.625,01:08:30.250,Okay. Hold it.
01:08:30.291,01:08:32.834,"Let's hold it down, people."
01:08:32.875,01:08:35.917,for direct abort is the S.P.S.
01:08:35.959,01:08:38.250,"From what Lovell has told us, it could have been damaged in an explosion."
01:08:38.291,01:08:40.417,So let's consider that engine dead.
01:08:40.458,01:08:42.166,"We light that thing up, it could blow the whole works."
01:08:42.208,01:08:44.750,It's just too risky.
01:08:44.792,01:08:47.291,About the only thing the command module is good for is reentry.
01:08:47.333,01:08:51.083,"So that leaves us with the LEM, which means free-return trajectory."
01:08:51.125,01:08:58.917,"Once we get the guys around the moon, we'll fire up the LEM engine, make a long burn, pick up some speed and get home as quick as we can."
01:08:58.959,01:09:03.166,"Gene, I-I'm wondering what the-- what the Grumman guys think about this."
01:09:03.208,01:09:07.625,We can't make any guarantees.
01:09:03.208,01:09:09.792,"We designed the LEM to land on the moon, not fire the engine out there for course corrections."
01:09:09.834,01:09:13.250,"Well, unfortunately, we're not landing on the moon, are we?"
01:09:15.959,01:09:18.375,I don't care what anything was designed to do.
01:09:19.792,01:09:23.083,So let's get to work.
01:09:23.125,01:09:27.291,"CAPCOM? Uh, Flight, he says it'll be ready in time."
01:09:27.333,01:09:29.458,"After this burn, we've got to build some time in the flight plan..."
01:09:29.500,01:09:31.000,for them to get some sleep.
01:09:31.041,01:09:32.625,Run it by the F.A.O.
01:09:32.667,01:09:34.333,I've run it by the F.A.O.
01:09:34.375,01:09:36.166,Do we know how long we're gonna fire that P.C. burn?
01:09:36.208,01:09:38.709,He specifically wanted a quote from a flight director.
01:09:38.750,01:09:41.291,Who wanted a quote?
01:09:41.333,01:09:43.792,The president?
01:09:45.208,01:09:47.709,We are not losing the crew.
01:09:47.750,01:09:50.792,"Gene, I gotta give him odds."
01:09:50.834,01:09:52.375,I don't think they're that good.
01:09:52.417,01:09:54.667,We are not losing those men.
01:09:58.792,01:10:00.834,"Ah, that's really terrific."
01:10:00.875,01:10:02.834,at P.C. plus two?
01:10:02.875,01:10:05.125,"Look, tell him..."
01:10:07.959,01:10:11.041,Expect loss of signal in less than one minute.
01:10:11.083,01:10:14.667,"When we pick you back up, we will have your P.C. plus two burn data."
01:10:14.709,01:10:18.250,We'll hear from you again at acquisition of signal.
01:10:21.458,01:10:23.208,You want to look?
01:10:25.375,01:10:27.125,"Oh, look at that."
01:10:30.000,01:10:31.291,Wow.
01:10:35.709,01:10:38.583,"Aquarius, that's 30 seconds until loss of signal."
01:10:43.083,01:10:44.959,Mare Tranquillitatis.
01:10:46.500,01:10:48.959,Neil and Buzz's old neighborhood.
01:10:50.291,01:10:52.667,Coming up on Mount Marilyn.
01:10:52.709,01:10:54.917,"Jim, you got to take a look at this."
01:10:56.834,01:10:58.250,I've seen it.
01:11:04.792,01:11:06.542,"Aquarius, this is Houston."
01:11:06.583,01:11:09.625,We expect loss of signal in approximately 10 seconds.
01:11:11.500,01:11:14.125,"So long, Earth."
01:11:21.458,01:11:23.709,When you go into the shadow of the moon...
01:11:23.750,01:11:30.709,"and the moon is between you and the sun, then you see stars that are more brilliant than anything you've ever seen..."
01:11:30.750,01:11:33.125,on the clearest nights here on Earth.
01:11:33.166,01:11:38.000,"And then, uh, you pass into the lunar sunrise over the lunar surface."
01:11:38.041,01:11:40.542,"And, uh, it must be an awe-inspiring sight."
01:11:40.583,01:11:43.709,I-I-I can't wait to see it myself.
01:11:43.750,01:11:53.709,"The problem now is not so much a question of an adequate oxygen supply, but it is the rate of consumption of water, which is vitally needed for the cooling operations..."
01:11:53.750,01:11:55.583,to maintain the electronic systems and so forth.
01:12:34.291,01:12:35.917,"Look, it's Fra Mauro."
01:12:38.083,01:12:39.667,I can see our landing site.
01:12:41.959,01:12:43.709,Wow.
01:12:43.750,01:12:46.917,Look at that Tsiolkovsky crater.
01:12:49.625,01:12:52.458,I can't believe how bright the ejecta blanket is.
01:12:52.500,01:12:55.417,It's like snow.
01:12:57.125,01:12:59.083,That's Mare Imbrium to the north.
01:14:02.458,01:14:04.542,"Thirteen, this is Houston."
01:14:04.583,01:14:08.500,We're reading your telemetry.
01:14:08.542,01:14:11.250,"Good to see you too, Houston."
01:14:11.291,01:14:15.667,"picking you up at a velocity of 7,062 feet per second..."
01:14:15.709,01:14:19.250,at a distance from the moon of 56 nautical miles.
01:14:19.291,01:14:22.667,Stand by for your P.C. plus two burn data.
01:14:22.709,01:14:27.667,"an itch to take this baby down though, do some prospectin'."
01:14:28.834,01:14:30.500,"Damn, we were close."
01:14:33.375,01:14:35.959,"Gentlemen, what are your intentions?"
01:14:40.041,01:14:41.834,I'd like to go home.
01:14:44.125,01:14:47.041,We got a burn coming up.
01:14:47.083,01:14:49.333,We're gonna need a contingency if we lose comm with Houston.
01:14:51.000,01:14:54.417,"Freddo, let's get an idea where we stand on the consumables."
01:14:54.458,01:14:59.250,"Jack, get into the Odyssey and bag up all the water you can before it freezes in there."
01:15:02.583,01:15:04.834,Let's go home.
01:15:04.875,01:15:08.041,we got some P.C. plus two burn data for you fellas.
01:15:08.083,01:15:13.333,So you're telling me you can only give our guys 45 hours?
01:15:13.375,01:15:15.792,That brings them to about there.
01:15:20.625,01:15:22.417,"Gentlemen, that's not acceptable."
01:15:22.458,01:15:25.834,"Gene, Gene, Gene, we've got to talk about power here."
01:15:25.875,01:15:29.125,"Whoa, whoa, guys!"
01:15:29.166,01:15:31.709,Power is everything.
01:15:31.750,01:15:36.959,"Without it, they don't talk to us, they don't correct their trajectory, they don't turn the heat shield around."
01:15:37.000,01:15:39.750,"We got to turn everything off, now."
01:15:39.792,01:15:41.583,They're not going to make it to reentry.
01:15:41.625,01:15:45.041,"What do you mean, everything?"
01:15:45.083,01:15:49.417,"At that rate, in 16 hours the batteries are dead, not 45."
01:15:49.458,01:15:51.917,And so is the crew.
01:15:51.959,01:15:54.041,Twelve amps?
01:15:54.083,01:15:56.500,"You can't run a vacuum cleaner on 12 amps, John."
01:15:56.542,01:16:03.125,"We gotta turn off-- We have to turn off the radars, cabin heater, instrument displays, the guidance computer, the whole smash."
01:16:03.166,01:16:05.500,Whoa! Guidance computer.
01:16:05.542,01:16:07.458,"Gene, they won't even know which way they're pointed."
01:16:07.500,01:16:09.750,"The more time we talk down here, the more juice they waste up there."
01:16:09.792,01:16:12.166,I've been looking at the data for the past hour.
01:16:12.208,01:16:13.625,That's the deal.
01:16:18.250,01:16:20.959,"Okay, John."
01:16:21.000,01:16:23.041,"The minute we finish the burn, we'll power down the LEM."
01:16:23.083,01:16:25.583,All right.
01:16:25.625,01:16:29.834,"Now in the meantime, we're gonna have a frozen command module up there."
01:16:29.875,01:16:31.875,"In a couple of days, we're gonna have to power it up..."
01:16:31.917,01:16:34.375,using nothing but the reentry batteries.
01:16:34.417,01:16:36.917,"Hell, we've never even simulated it before, Gene."
01:16:36.959,01:16:39.750,"Well, we're gonna have to figure it out."
01:16:39.792,01:16:43.208,I want people in our simulators working reentry scenarios.
01:16:43.250,01:16:48.375,"I want you guys to find every engineer who designed every switch, every circuit, every transistor and every light bulb that's up there."
01:16:48.417,01:16:51.917,Then I want you to talk to the guy in the assembly line who actually built the thing.
01:16:51.959,01:16:56.458,Find out how to squeeze every amp out of both of these goddamn machines.
01:16:56.500,01:17:01.375,I want this mark all the way back to Earth with time to spare.
01:17:01.417,01:17:03.709,We never lost an American in space.
01:17:03.750,01:17:07.875,We're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch.
01:17:12.834,01:17:14.834,Ken?
01:17:14.875,01:17:16.834,Ken?
01:17:16.875,01:17:19.959,What? Huh?
01:17:20.000,01:17:22.542,I've been trying to get in touch with you for 45 minutes.
01:17:22.583,01:17:24.709,"John. Jesus, John, what are you doing here?"
01:17:24.750,01:17:26.875,Got to get you in the simulators.
01:17:26.917,01:17:29.333,What?
01:17:29.375,01:17:33.375,Oxygen tanks are gone.
01:17:33.417,01:17:35.792,What about the crew?
01:17:35.834,01:17:38.125,Trying to keep them alive in the LEM.
01:17:38.166,01:17:41.291,We're gonna have to shut that down pretty soon too.
01:17:41.333,01:17:44.166,"We got a lot of people working the numbers on this one, Ken."
01:17:44.208,01:17:47.041,Nobody's too sure how much power we're gonna have when we hit reentry.
01:17:47.083,01:17:49.458,The command module's gonna be frozen up pretty good by then.
01:17:51.375,01:17:55.000,"You see this ammeter rise over 20 at any point, power-up is no good."
01:17:55.041,01:17:57.166,"We see it spike, that's sayonara for the guidance computer."
01:17:57.208,01:17:59.083,Our guys can't reenter.
01:17:59.125,01:18:01.417,How much power do we have to play with?
01:18:01.458,01:18:03.542,Barely enough to run this coffee pot for nine hours.
01:18:03.583,01:18:06.000,Go.
01:18:06.041,01:18:08.542,Copy.
01:18:08.583,01:18:10.959,They've been losing heat since the accident.
01:18:11.000,01:18:13.750,They're gonna start getting a lot of water condensation on the control panels.
01:18:13.792,01:18:17.333,"Ken, glad you're here."
01:18:17.375,01:18:19.834,What do we have left in the batteries?
01:18:19.875,01:18:23.709,We got to get started on some shortcuts for power-up.
01:18:23.750,01:18:27.417,It's all in the sequencing.
01:18:27.458,01:18:30.291,"and turn things on in the right order, maybe-- I agree."
01:18:30.333,01:18:33.709,You started on a procedure?
01:18:33.750,01:18:36.291,We got to get you in there.
01:18:36.333,01:18:39.500,"Frank, I need the SIM cold and dark."
01:18:39.542,01:18:41.750,Give me the exact same conditions they've got in there now.
01:18:41.792,01:18:44.375,And I need present status of every instrument.
01:18:44.417,01:18:46.125,I need a flashlight.
01:18:46.166,01:18:47.875,That's not what they have up there.
01:18:47.917,01:18:49.917,Don't give me anything they don't have on board.
01:18:49.959,01:18:51.875,Let's get this show on the road.
01:18:54.500,01:18:59.625,"Okay, Houston, the quad heater circuit breakers are open."
01:18:59.667,01:19:05.250,"We're using the forward omni when the Earth's in the window, and we're switching to aft omni when we see the moon."
01:19:05.291,01:19:07.166,"We copy that, 13."
01:19:07.208,01:19:09.750,"Aquarius, we don't want you to make any more waste dumps."
01:19:09.792,01:19:13.125,The venting may push you off course.
01:19:13.166,01:19:15.834,"Oh, Christ."
01:19:15.875,01:19:20.125,No more waste dumps.
01:19:20.166,01:19:21.667,"Jack, we're gonna need some more urine bags."
01:19:23.500,01:19:29.917,"Okay, Houston, that leaves us with just the computer, which I'm shutting down now."
01:19:36.375,01:19:38.667,And that's it.
01:19:38.709,01:19:41.291,We just put Sir Isaac Newton in the driver's seat.
01:19:47.250,01:19:49.750,Is it a.m. or p.m.?
01:19:49.792,01:19:52.959,A.M.
01:19:53.000,01:19:58.083,"Haise is running a temperature, and none of them has slept since-- I can't order these guys to go to sleep."
01:19:58.125,01:20:00.792,Could you sleep up there?
01:20:03.417,01:20:07.166,"Gene, we have a situation brewing with the carbon dioxide."
01:20:07.208,01:20:09.750,We got a CO2 filter problem on the lunar module.
01:20:09.792,01:20:13.542,- Five filters on the LEM.
01:20:13.583,01:20:15.917,I told the doc-- They're already up to eight on the gauges.
01:20:15.959,01:20:22.583,"Anything over 15 and you get impaired judgment, blackouts, beginnings of brain asphyxia."
01:20:22.625,01:20:24.750,They take square cartridges.
01:20:27.417,01:20:29.875,Tell me this isn't a government operation.
01:20:29.917,01:20:32.583,It just isn't a contingency we've remotely looked at.
01:20:32.625,01:20:35.000,Those CO2 levels are gonna be getting toxic.
01:20:35.041,01:20:39.834,"Well, I suggest you gentlemen invent a way to put a square peg in a round hole... rapidly."
01:20:43.291,01:20:45.500,"Okay, people, listen up."
01:20:45.542,01:20:50.583,"The people upstairs have handed us this one, and we gotta come through."
01:20:50.625,01:20:54.625,We got to find a way to make this...
01:20:54.667,01:20:57.625,fit into the hole for this...
01:20:57.667,01:20:59.917,using nothing but that.
01:21:01.542,01:21:04.250,Let's get it organized.
01:21:04.291,01:21:07.375,"Better get some coffee going too, someone."
01:21:07.417,01:21:10.375,"The Haise family lives in El Lago, Texas."
01:21:10.417,01:21:13.500,"His wife, Mary, is from Biloxi, Mississippi."
01:21:13.542,01:21:19.375,"When Fred Haise was growing up in Biloxi, he may have looked ahead to a fine family, but he never dreamt of flying."
01:21:19.417,01:21:25.333,"I'd never flown really before I went into the service, and, uh, I only went into the flying business as a means to getting a commission."
01:21:25.375,01:21:26.917,Good morning.
01:21:26.959,01:21:29.709,"Henry, don't you ever sleep?"
01:21:29.750,01:21:33.417,"- I, uh-- I have a request from the news people."
01:21:33.458,01:21:35.667,"They're out front here, and they want to put a transmitter up on the lawn."
01:21:38.208,01:21:40.083,Transmitter?
01:21:40.125,01:21:42.542,It's kind of a tower for a live broadcast.
01:21:48.333,01:21:51.959,I thought they didn't care about this mission.
01:21:53.583,01:21:56.917,"Well, it's more dramatic now."
01:21:53.583,01:22:00.291,"Suddenly people are-- Landing on the moon wasn't dramatic enough for them, why should not landing on it be?"
01:22:00.333,01:22:07.166,"Look, I, um-- I realize how hard this is, Marilyn, but the whole world is caught up in it."
01:22:07.208,01:22:09.625,"It's the biggest story since-- No, Henry."
01:22:09.667,01:22:14.667,Those people don't put one piece of equipment on my lawn.
01:22:14.709,01:22:18.333,"If they have a problem with that, they can take it up with my husband."
01:22:18.375,01:22:20.834,He'll be home on Friday.
01:23:04.709,01:23:06.417,"Hey, Freddo."
01:23:06.458,01:23:08.458,It's too cold in there.
01:23:10.583,01:23:12.208,Yeah.
01:23:23.959,01:23:25.375,That's a nice one of Mary.
01:23:29.917,01:23:32.333,"You don't look too good, Freddo."
01:23:32.375,01:23:35.333,There's some aspirin in the medical kit.
01:23:35.375,01:23:36.917,"Jim, I'm all right."
01:23:42.625,01:23:46.041,"It was an accident, Mary gettin' pregnant."
01:23:47.834,01:23:50.542,You should have seen the look on my face when she told me.
01:23:52.333,01:23:55.166,"Well, that has a tendency to happen."
01:23:56.834,01:23:57.959,Yeah.
01:24:02.583,01:24:04.375,I wonder if it's a boy or a girl.
01:24:06.792,01:24:08.250,You're gonna find out soon enough.
01:24:09.709,01:24:11.208,Sure.
01:24:15.041,01:24:20.083,I never dreamed I'd ever get to do something like this-- come up here on a real mission.
01:24:22.208,01:24:24.417,Most of the guys I graduated high school with...
01:24:24.458,01:24:26.709,"never even left home, and here I am."
01:24:26.750,01:24:30.792,"Yeah, here you are."
01:24:36.375,01:24:37.709,It hurts when I urinate.
01:24:39.083,01:24:41.125,"Well, you're not gettin' enough water."
01:24:41.166,01:24:43.291,I'm drinking my ration the same as you.
01:24:47.375,01:24:50.333,I think old Swigert gave me the clap.
01:24:50.375,01:24:53.083,He's been pissin' in my relief tube.
01:24:57.041,01:25:00.709,"Well, that will be a hot one at the debriefing for the flight surgeon."
01:25:00.750,01:25:04.417,That's another first for America's space program.
01:25:07.041,01:25:17.959,"Listen, um, I've been going... over some stuff, and I'm a little worried about this cold affecting our battery efficiency."
01:25:18.000,01:25:24.250,"You know, we quit heatin' the glycol to save water and power, so that's not helping us any."
01:25:24.291,01:25:28.375,- That's a possibility.
01:25:28.417,01:25:30.291,Have they called up with a reentry plan yet?
01:25:30.333,01:25:32.542,'Cause we're comin' in too shallow and fast.
01:25:32.583,01:25:35.458,Just hold on.
01:25:35.500,01:25:39.208,We got no references on board.
01:25:39.250,01:25:43.166,"Listen, listen, listen."
01:25:43.208,01:25:46.291,"At this rate we're gonna skip right out of the atmosphere, and we're never gonna get back."
01:25:46.333,01:25:49.583,What are you talkin' about?
01:25:49.625,01:25:51.291,I can add.
01:25:53.875,01:25:58.000,They've got half the Ph.D.s on the planet working on this.
01:25:58.041,01:26:01.458,What if they made a mistake and there was no way to reverse it?
01:26:01.500,01:26:04.917,There's no reason to tell us.
01:26:04.959,01:26:07.834,There's a thousand things that have to happen in order.
01:26:07.875,01:26:13.041,We are on number eight.
01:26:13.083,01:26:15.959,"And in the meantime, I'm trying to tell you we're coming in too fast."
01:26:16.000,01:26:19.375,"I think they know it, and I think that's why we don't have a goddamn reentry plan."
01:26:19.417,01:26:20.959,That's duly noted.
01:26:21.000,01:26:23.667,Ow!
01:26:23.709,01:26:25.792,Goddamn this piece of shit!
01:26:25.834,01:26:28.166,This piece of shit's gonna get you home.
01:26:28.208,01:26:30.500,"That's because that's the only thing we got left, Jack!"
01:26:31.834,01:26:33.917,"What are you saying, Fred?"
01:26:33.959,01:26:36.500,"Oh, I think you know what I'm saying."
01:26:36.542,01:26:40.250,Now wait a minute.
01:26:40.291,01:26:42.291,What was that gauge reading before you hit the switch?
01:26:42.333,01:26:44.709,Don't tell me how to fly the damn C.M.!
01:26:44.750,01:26:48.375,They brought me in to do a job!
01:26:48.417,01:26:51.625,"- Jack, stop kicking yourself in the ass."
01:26:51.667,01:26:54.250,No one is saying it is.
01:26:54.291,01:26:58.208,"If I'm in the left-hand seat when the call comes up, I stir the tanks."
01:26:58.250,01:27:00.792,"- Yeah, well, tell him that."
01:26:58.250,01:27:04.500,"- I just asked you what the gauge was readin', - and you don't know!"
01:27:04.542,01:27:07.083,We're not gonna go bouncing off the walls for 10 minutes...
01:27:07.125,01:27:09.959,because we're just gonna end up right back here with the same problems!
01:27:10.000,01:27:12.875,Try to figure out how to stay alive!
01:27:14.125,01:27:15.667,"Aquarius, this is Houston."
01:27:15.709,01:27:18.625,- Are we on VOX?
01:27:18.667,01:27:21.041,"Yeah, Houston, this is Aquarius. Go ahead."
01:27:23.208,01:27:26.041,"Yeah, Jim, could you check your CO2 gauge for us?"
01:27:28.625,01:27:31.250,"Uh, yeah, Houston, we were just looking at that."
01:27:31.291,01:27:35.250,Our CO2 measurement has jumped four notches in the last hour.
01:27:35.291,01:27:38.250,That can't be right.
01:27:38.291,01:27:42.208,"Jim, that sounds about right."
01:27:42.250,01:27:45.500,"Well, that's very comforting to know, Houston."
01:27:45.542,01:27:49.875,"Jim, we're working on a procedure down here for you."
01:27:49.917,01:27:52.875,Do you copy?
01:27:52.917,01:27:55.250,"All right, Houston, we're standing by for those procedures."
01:27:55.291,01:27:58.208,"Christ, I know why my numbers are wrong."
01:27:58.250,01:28:00.500,I only figured it for two people.
01:28:04.583,01:28:06.250,Maybe I should just hold my breath.
01:28:08.291,01:28:11.959,The deadly CO2 gas is literally poisoning the astronauts...
01:28:12.000,01:28:14.208,with every breath in and out.
01:28:14.250,01:28:19.583,"NASA spokespeople will not comment further-- Oh! Go, go, go, go!"
01:28:19.625,01:28:21.375,"Heads up, people."
01:28:24.834,01:28:28.667,What's this?
01:28:28.709,01:28:31.792,"Well, I hope you got the procedures for me."
01:28:31.834,01:28:33.208,That's it?
01:28:35.834,01:28:37.750,"All right, Aquarius, this is Houston."
01:28:37.792,01:28:40.000,Do you have a flight plan up there?
01:28:40.041,01:28:42.959,"Uh, affirmative, Andy."
01:28:43.000,01:28:46.834,"Okay, we have a, uh-- an unusual procedure for you here."
01:28:46.875,01:28:48.917,We need you to rip the cover off.
01:28:48.959,01:28:51.333,He wants you to rip the cover off the flight plan.
01:28:51.375,01:28:54.125,With pleasure.
01:28:54.166,01:28:56.417,now the other materials you're gonna need here are...
01:28:56.458,01:29:01.417,"a lithium hydroxide canister-- Two, two."
01:29:01.458,01:29:03.875,A roll of gray tape.
01:29:03.917,01:29:09.000,You need an L.C.G. bag-- Two L.C.G. bags.
01:29:09.041,01:29:12.500,"The red suit hoses, and you've got the flight plan cover."
01:29:14.750,01:29:17.542,Excuse me.
01:29:17.583,01:29:20.208,What about their level of carbon dioxide?
01:29:20.250,01:29:22.250,"It's, uh, climbing."
01:29:22.291,01:29:26.542,"- Yeah, you."
01:29:26.583,01:29:30.291,Now wait a second. That's-- That's not what he said.
01:29:32.000,01:29:34.333,You want to cut the duct tape three feet long.
01:29:34.375,01:29:36.709,Tell him to use his arm.
01:29:36.750,01:29:39.750,It's a good arm length.
01:29:39.792,01:29:42.583,"Okay, Jack, tear that piece of tape down the middle lengthwise."
01:29:42.625,01:29:44.583,All right?
01:29:46.959,01:29:53.458,"While the astronauts appear to have enough oxygen to keep them alive, one thing they have too much of is carbon dioxide."
01:29:53.500,01:29:55.709,"With each breath, the three men expel..."
01:29:55.750,01:30:03.417,"more of the poisonous gas into the lunar module cockpit, and the scrubbers intended to keep the atmosphere breathable are quickly becoming saturated."
01:30:05.667,01:30:07.667,"Oh, shit. I tore it."
01:30:09.333,01:30:11.458,Shit!
01:30:11.500,01:30:15.792,"Uh, Houston, what do we do if we, uh, rip the bag?"
01:30:15.834,01:30:18.000,They just tore the bag.
01:30:18.041,01:30:20.250,"Uh, stand by."
01:30:20.291,01:30:22.083,They should have one more bag left.
01:30:22.125,01:30:25.208,"But they've still got, uh, a long way to come."
01:30:25.250,01:30:30.166,"And they are now working on their backup facilities, their emergency facilities."
01:30:30.208,01:30:33.750,"And the problem is, if anything more goes wrong, they're in real trouble."
01:31:03.083,01:31:07.166,"As most of you are aware, there is no rescue possible in spaceflight."
01:31:07.208,01:31:12.000,Any rescue system the space agency has long since calculated-- Hold this a minute.
01:31:12.041,01:31:23.000,Any rescue system the space agency calculated-- One sock.
01:31:20.125,01:31:25.542,"have the sock in place, we're gonna want you to bungee-- Work it in."
01:31:25.583,01:31:31.750,"the entire filter assembly to the bulkhead, - right above the LEM canister."
01:31:31.792,01:31:36.166,So how does this flight compare to other emergency situations you've faced?
01:31:38.333,01:31:41.458,"Well, I'd have to say that this is the most serious situation..."
01:31:41.500,01:31:44.083,we've ever encountered in manned spaceflight.
01:31:44.125,01:31:48.125,"Houston, filter's in place."
01:31:48.166,01:31:50.500,Suit circuit relief to close.
01:31:50.542,01:31:54.875,CO2 canister select to secondary.
01:31:54.917,01:31:58.375,Here goes.
01:31:58.417,01:32:00.166,I can hear air moving.
01:32:13.166,01:32:14.917,"Just breathe normal, fellas."
01:32:17.625,01:32:21.125,"Aquarius, please advise on the CO2 status."
01:32:21.166,01:32:23.792,"Uh, yeah, Houston, we're taking a look at those numbers right now."
01:32:28.041,01:32:31.083,"Uh, we're still holding close to 15, Houston."
01:32:31.125,01:32:32.917,Roger that.
01:32:44.500,01:32:48.792,"Houston, the CO2 level has dropped to nine..."
01:32:48.834,01:32:50.750,and it is still falling.
01:32:52.166,01:32:55.417,Yes!
01:32:55.458,01:32:57.625,"That is good to hear, Aquarius."
01:32:57.667,01:32:59.709,"And you, sir, are a steely-eyed missile man."
01:33:05.000,01:33:08.291,"Okay, spacecraft control to computer."
01:33:08.333,01:33:09.959,- Damn!
01:33:12.959,01:33:14.750,Damn.
01:33:14.792,01:33:17.375,We overloaded.
01:33:17.417,01:33:19.709,We used way too much power there.
01:33:19.750,01:33:24.208,There must be a sneak circuit someplace between step seven and 10.
01:33:24.250,01:33:26.500,"All right, which one has the leak?"
01:33:26.542,01:33:29.125,"Don't know that yet, John."
01:33:29.166,01:33:33.375,The sequence was wrong.
01:33:33.417,01:33:35.250,"You need a break, Ken?"
01:33:35.291,01:33:38.083,"If they don't get one, I don't get one."
01:33:42.542,01:33:45.166,"Well, if it won't work, get me another one."
01:33:45.208,01:33:48.542,My son's supposed to be on.
01:33:48.583,01:33:53.500,"- Hi, Blanch."
01:33:53.542,01:33:56.458,"Blanch, it's Marilyn."
01:33:56.500,01:33:58.750,"Hi, Grandma."
01:33:58.792,01:34:03.709,I was gonna see Jimmy.
01:34:05.208,01:34:08.208,We came to tell you something.
01:34:08.250,01:34:13.208,There's been an accident.
01:34:13.250,01:34:17.458,"Uh, but he's not going to get to walk on the moon."
01:34:17.500,01:34:20.792,"Well, they said he was."
01:34:20.834,01:34:22.625,I know. I know.
01:34:22.667,01:34:27.458,that was before.
01:34:27.500,01:34:31.083,"Now there's been an explosion, and they're all okay."
01:34:31.125,01:34:35.333,They're all right.
01:34:35.375,01:34:38.709,try to figure out a way to get them home.
01:34:41.208,01:34:47.709,And-- And it's a little bit dangerous.
01:34:49.041,01:34:50.917,"Oh, sweetie."
01:34:54.166,01:34:56.000,Are you scared?
01:34:59.542,01:35:03.458,"Well, don't you worry, honey."
01:35:03.500,01:35:10.583,"If they could get a washing machine to fly, my Jimmy could land it."
01:35:49.333,01:35:57.583,"you'll be happy to hear that we contacted President Nixon, and he's gonna grant you an extension on your income taxes..."
01:35:57.625,01:36:02.208,since you are most decidedly out of the country.
01:36:02.250,01:36:04.917,"Roger that, Houston."
01:36:04.959,01:36:07.709,That's wonderful news.
01:36:07.750,01:36:10.125,Tell them they have to sleep.
01:36:10.166,01:36:12.625,Haise is running a fever of 104.
01:36:12.667,01:36:16.250,"Uh, 13, listen, we've had another request from the flight surgeon..."
01:36:16.291,01:36:18.208,that you fellas get some more sleep.
01:36:18.250,01:36:21.458,He doesn't like his readings down here.
01:36:21.500,01:36:23.667,Let's see how he feels about this.
01:36:23.709,01:36:27.667,I am sick and tired of the entire western world...
01:36:27.709,01:36:31.000,knowing how my kidneys are functioning!
01:36:32.375,01:36:36.625,"Flight, I just lost Lovell."
01:36:41.250,01:36:44.041,"Uh, 13, this is Houston."
01:36:44.083,01:36:48.458,"Jim, we just had a dropout on your bio-med sensors."
01:36:48.500,01:36:51.792,"I'm not wearing my bio-med sensors, Houston."
01:37:01.083,01:37:04.166,"Okay, Jim. Copy that."
01:37:18.709,01:37:22.792,"Flight, now I'm losing all three of 'em!"
01:37:22.834,01:37:25.667,"It's just a little medical mutiny, Doc."
01:37:25.709,01:37:27.375,I'm sure the guys are still with us.
01:37:28.667,01:37:30.625,"Let's cut 'em some slack, okay?"
01:37:42.625,01:37:46.959,"Gene, it's not the velocity, it's the angle."
01:37:47.000,01:37:52.375,"I mean, maybe they're still venting something and that's throwing off the trajectory, but we are definitely shallowing again."
01:37:52.417,01:37:55.667,We are up to a 5.9.
01:37:55.709,01:37:58.333,"At this rate, they nick the Earth's atmosphere and bounce off into space."
01:37:58.375,01:38:00.792,We never get 'em back.
01:38:00.834,01:38:02.625,Definitely another burn.
01:38:02.667,01:38:04.792,Fire the engines and get 'em on course.
01:38:24.500,01:38:26.709,"Aquarius, this is Houston."
01:38:28.417,01:38:30.500,"Houston, Aquarius."
01:38:30.542,01:38:34.417,"Uh, Jim, we've got another course correction for you."
01:38:34.458,01:38:35.834,What's up?
01:38:35.875,01:38:38.583,Something about another course correction.
01:38:38.625,01:38:42.250,"Uh, we copy, uh, Houston."
01:38:42.291,01:38:46.208,Be advised it's gonna take Freddo and I a while to power up the computer...
01:38:46.250,01:38:49.750,for the alignment platform if we have to fire the engine.
01:38:49.792,01:38:51.417,"Uh, negative on that, Jim."
01:38:51.458,01:38:54.750,"We can't, uh, spare power for the computer."
01:38:54.792,01:38:57.041,We gotta do this blind?
01:38:57.083,01:39:01.250,"Uh, Houston, without the computer, what do we use for orientation?"
01:39:01.291,01:39:03.917,"Syd, come on."
01:39:03.959,01:39:06.333,"Without the power, we can't give them a reading."
01:39:06.375,01:39:08.417,I'm not talking about power.
01:39:08.458,01:39:11.125,"No. No, there's no references."
01:39:11.166,01:39:14.750,"Houston, what's the story with this burn?"
01:39:14.792,01:39:17.750,"We're trying to hash something out down here, Aquarius."
01:39:17.792,01:39:20.041,Stand by.
01:39:20.083,01:39:25.333,"Well, now, look, Houston, all we need to hold attitude is one fixed point in space."
01:39:25.375,01:39:27.041,Is that not correct?
01:39:27.083,01:39:29.000,"Yeah. Roger that, Jim."
01:39:33.166,01:39:35.959,"Well, Houston, we've got one."
01:39:36.000,01:39:45.291,"If we can keep the Earth in the window, flying manually, the co-ax cross hairs right on its terminator, all I have to know is how long do we need to burn the engine?"
01:39:45.333,01:39:47.208,"The shorter, the better."
01:39:47.250,01:39:49.125,"Roger that, Jim."
01:39:49.166,01:39:53.208,Can they fly it manually and still shut it down on time without the computer?
01:39:56.041,01:39:58.166,"I guess that's the best we can do, Glynn."
01:39:58.208,01:40:00.000,We're out of time.
01:40:00.041,01:40:05.959,"In order to enter the atmosphere safely, the crew must aim for a corridor just 2 1/2 degrees wide."
01:40:06.000,01:40:09.375,"If they're too steep, they'll incinerate in the steadily thickening air."
01:40:09.417,01:40:11.750,"If they're too shallow, they'll ricochet off the atmosphere..."
01:40:11.792,01:40:13.834,like a rock skipping off a pond.
01:40:13.875,01:40:16.041,"The reentry corridor is, in fact, so narrow..."
01:40:16.083,01:40:18.333,that if this basketball were the Earth...
01:40:18.375,01:40:26.875,"and this softball were the moon, and the two were placed 14 feet apart, the crew would have to hit a target no thicker than this piece of paper."
01:40:26.917,01:40:29.542,"Okay, people, on your toes."
01:40:29.583,01:40:36.291,"Gene, I want you to understand we've never tried this before-- burn, cold soak, burn, cold soak, burn, manual control."
01:40:36.333,01:40:38.250,"Look, it will ignite, will it not?"
01:40:38.291,01:40:42.166,I just want you to know the engine's never been tried like this.
01:40:42.208,01:40:44.458,That's all I'm trying to tell you.
01:40:44.500,01:40:48.500,I know what you're trying to do.
01:40:48.542,01:40:52.583,"If it lights, it lights."
01:40:52.625,01:40:54.542,Okay.
01:40:54.583,01:40:59.375,"They're gonna burn the engines and steer it manually, attempting to keep the Earth in the window."
01:41:06.458,01:41:09.583,"Okay, this is gonna take all three of us."
01:41:09.625,01:41:11.959,Freddo...
01:41:12.000,01:41:14.083,you handle the pitch.
01:41:14.125,01:41:16.625,"But on the translation controller, it's all backwards."
01:41:16.667,01:41:23.250,"So if the Earth starts drifting down, you need to thrust aft, not forward."
01:41:23.291,01:41:26.000,I'll do the same on mine with everything else.
01:41:26.041,01:41:28.375,We're going to burn at 10% thrust for 39 seconds.
01:41:28.417,01:41:31.083,"Jack, you time us."
01:41:31.125,01:41:33.750,Give us a count of the last 10 seconds up to 39.
01:41:33.792,01:41:35.333,Let's not miss this.
01:41:38.000,01:41:39.333,"You up to this, Freddo?"
01:41:42.083,01:41:44.208,I'm with you.
01:41:44.250,01:41:47.834,Standing by for corridor control burn.
01:41:47.875,01:41:50.667,"Okay, Jim, you can fire when ready."
01:41:50.709,01:41:53.250,You are go for the manual burn.
01:41:53.291,01:41:56.917,"Okay, X plus button at 10 seconds. Mark."
01:41:56.959,01:41:59.542,One more burn.
01:41:56.959,01:42:04.583,"Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three-- Ullage is go."
01:42:04.625,01:42:07.500,"two, one, ignition!"
01:42:08.834,01:42:10.750,She's burnin'!
01:42:10.792,01:42:13.834,- Master arm off.
01:42:13.875,01:42:17.834,"R.C.S. is go, 10% thrust."
01:42:17.875,01:42:21.125,"- Bring her around, Freddo."
01:42:21.166,01:42:23.208,Ten seconds.
01:42:23.250,01:42:24.917,"All right, drop it down, Freddo."
01:42:24.959,01:42:26.625,We're driftin'!
01:42:26.667,01:42:28.709,And I'll roll it.
01:42:28.750,01:42:31.417,She's dancin' all over the place!
01:42:31.458,01:42:33.917,"Come to the right a little bit, a little bit."
01:42:33.959,01:42:36.458,She's driftin'.
01:42:36.500,01:42:39.417,Hold it right it there.
01:42:39.458,01:42:41.792,Shit! I'm losin' it!
01:42:41.834,01:42:45.083,"- Thrust forward, Fred."
01:42:45.125,01:42:46.792,"Shit, I lost it!"
01:42:46.834,01:42:47.917,Where is it?
01:42:47.959,01:42:50.000,Helium regulator's closed.
01:42:50.041,01:42:52.417,"Bring it down, Freddo."
01:42:52.458,01:42:54.208,"Okay, uh, okay, I got it!"
01:42:54.250,01:42:57.083,Little farther.
01:42:57.125,01:43:02.500,Damn it!
01:43:02.542,01:43:05.834,"A little more. Come on, baby."
01:43:05.875,01:43:08.500,"Back, back! That's it!"
01:43:08.542,01:43:10.375,Shutdown!
01:43:17.875,01:43:18.917,"Oh, yeah."
01:43:20.166,01:43:23.083,"Houston, we have shutdown."
01:43:23.125,01:43:26.417,"That's close enough, Jim."
01:43:26.458,01:43:29.333,I knew it! I knew it!
01:43:29.375,01:43:32.333,How about it? Hmm?
01:43:32.375,01:43:34.875,Guess you can keep your job.
01:43:34.917,01:43:39.083,"Thirteen, stand by."
01:43:40.542,01:43:43.125,"Well, let's hope we don't have to do that again."
01:43:57.125,01:44:02.083,"Gentlemen, you've given our guys enough to survive till reentry."
01:44:02.125,01:44:03.959,Well done.
01:44:07.917,01:44:10.709,Now we gotta get 'em in.
01:44:10.750,01:44:13.333,Here's the order of what I want to do.
01:44:13.375,01:44:22.250,"I want to power up Guidance, E.C.S., Communications, warm up the, uh, pyros for the parachutes and the command module thrusters."
01:44:22.291,01:44:24.875,"The thrusters are gonna put you over budget on amps, Ken."
01:44:24.917,01:44:29.250,"Well, they've been sitting at 200 below for four days, John. They gotta be heated."
01:44:29.291,01:44:31.959,"Fine. Then trade off the parachutes, something."
01:44:32.000,01:44:34.542,"Well, if the chutes don't open, what's the point?"
01:44:34.583,01:44:38.333,You're telling me what you need.
01:44:38.375,01:44:41.750,- I'm not making this stuff up.
01:44:41.792,01:44:43.917,"We do not have the power, Ken."
01:44:43.959,01:44:45.917,We just don't have it.
01:44:48.917,01:44:51.625,"Okay, I'm gonna go back and reorganize the sequencing again..."
01:44:51.667,01:44:53.542,and find more power.
01:44:53.583,01:44:56.917,Let's start from scratch.
01:44:59.750,01:45:02.583,I don't know where the hell we're gonna find it.
01:45:02.625,01:45:12.083,"Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell has more time in space, almost 24 days already, than any other man, and I asked him recently if he ever was scared."
01:45:12.125,01:45:15.500,I've had an engine flame out a few times in an aircraft...
01:45:15.542,01:45:22.333,"and was curious as to whether it was going to light up again, things of that nature, but, uh, they seem to work out."
01:45:22.375,01:45:25.458,Is there a specific instance in an airplane emergency...
01:45:25.500,01:45:27.125,when you can recall fear?
01:45:28.875,01:45:35.834,"I remember this one time, I'm, uh-- I'm in a Banshee at night in combat conditions, so there's no running lights on the carrier."
01:45:35.875,01:45:38.166,"It was the Shangri-la, and we were in the Sea of Japan."
01:45:38.208,01:45:40.250,And my-- my radar had jammed...
01:45:40.291,01:45:42.625,and my homing signal was gone...
01:45:42.667,01:45:49.000,"because somebody in Japan was actually using the same frequency, and so it was leading me away from where I was supposed to be."
01:45:49.041,01:45:51.792,"And I'm looking down at a big, black ocean."
01:45:51.834,01:45:59.125,"So, uh, I flip on my map light, and then, suddenly, zap, everything shorts out right there in the cockpit."
01:45:59.166,01:46:02.917,All my instruments are gone.
01:46:02.959,01:46:08.125,"Uh, I know I'm running out of fuel, so I'm thinking about ditching in the ocean."
01:46:08.166,01:46:15.041,"And then I-- I look down there and then, in the darkness, there's this, uh-- there's this green trail."
01:46:15.083,01:46:18.250,It's like a long carpet that's just laid out right beneath me.
01:46:18.291,01:46:20.250,"And it was the algae, right?"
01:46:20.291,01:46:24.250,It was that phosphorescent stuff that gets churned up in the wake of a big ship.
01:46:24.291,01:46:27.083,And it was-- it was-- it was just leading me home.
01:46:27.125,01:46:32.750,"Now, if my cockpit lights hadn't shorted out, there's no way I'd have ever been able to see that."
01:46:32.792,01:46:35.709,"So, uh, you, uh-- you never know..."
01:46:35.750,01:46:38.625,what-- what events are going to transpire to get you home.
01:46:42.583,01:46:59.583,"commander Jim Lovell, no stranger to emergencies. He-- How's it going, Fred?"
01:46:59.625,01:47:01.583,I'm okay.
01:47:03.458,01:47:06.083,What the hell was that?
01:47:06.125,01:47:08.834,Let's hope it was just a burst disk.
01:47:08.875,01:47:13.000,"Uh, Houston, can you confirm a burst helium disk?"
01:47:13.041,01:47:17.333,"Uh, Houston, is that going to affect our, uh, entry angle at all?"
01:47:17.375,01:47:20.417,"Uh, negative. Your entry angle is holding at 6.24, Aquarius."
01:47:20.458,01:47:26.750,"Houston, uh, we-- we sure could use..."
01:47:26.792,01:47:28.917,the reentry procedure up here.
01:47:28.959,01:47:30.959,When can we expect that?
01:47:33.417,01:47:36.083,"Uh, that's coming real soon, Aquarius."
01:47:36.125,01:47:42.083,"Uh, Houston, uh, we-- we-- we just can't throw this together at the last minute."
01:47:42.125,01:47:44.917,"So, here's what you're gonna do."
01:47:44.959,01:47:53.750,"You're gonna get the procedure up to us, whatever it is, and we're gonna go over it step-by-step, so there's no foul-ups."
01:47:53.792,01:47:57.083,I don't have to tell you we're all a little tired up here.
01:47:57.125,01:47:59.834,The world's getting awfully big in the window.
01:47:59.875,01:48:02.375,"- Jim, this is Deke."
01:48:02.417,01:48:04.667,They don't know how to do it.
01:48:04.709,01:48:07.333,Maybe Jack's right.
01:48:08.625,01:48:10.583,"Hello there, Deke."
01:48:10.625,01:48:12.750,"Jim, we're gonna get that power-up procedure to you."
01:48:12.792,01:48:14.667,We're gonna get it as soon as we possibly can.
01:48:14.709,01:48:17.166,Ken Mattingly's in the simulator right now.
01:48:18.917,01:48:21.291,Ken's working on it?
01:48:23.959,01:48:26.041,Look...
01:48:26.083,01:48:28.000,"I know this sequence works, John."
01:48:28.041,01:48:30.792,The sequence looks good.
01:48:30.834,01:48:33.250,By how much?
01:48:33.291,01:48:35.375,"Goddamn it, John!"
01:48:35.417,01:48:37.375,Four.
01:48:37.417,01:48:40.125,Four more amps.
01:48:51.166,01:48:53.792,"We know they have some power left in the LEM batteries, right?"
01:48:53.834,01:48:56.417,Yeah.
01:48:56.458,01:49:00.500,We have an umbilical that provides power from the command module to the LEM.
01:49:00.542,01:49:03.959,Right. It's backup for the LEM power supply.
01:49:04.000,01:49:08.083,So... reverse it.
01:49:08.125,01:49:11.000,and see if we can draw these four amps from the LEM batteries before we cut it lose.
01:49:11.041,01:49:13.166,Why can't we do that?
01:49:13.208,01:49:15.166,"We don't have a procedure for that, do we?"
01:49:15.208,01:49:17.125,"You're gonna lose a lot in the transfer, Ken."
01:49:17.166,01:49:20.792,"Yeah, yeah, but all we're talking about here is four amps."
01:49:22.500,01:49:25.083,I want whatever you guys got on these power-up procedures.
01:49:25.125,01:49:28.291,"Gene, they're already-- I don't want the whole bible, just a couple of chapters."
01:49:28.333,01:49:30.625,We've got to get something up to these guys.
01:49:30.667,01:49:33.083,I'll call the simulator and get an estimate.
01:49:33.125,01:49:37.458,I don't want another estimate!
01:49:49.542,01:49:52.000,I.M.U. is up.
01:49:52.041,01:49:54.959,How am I reading?
01:49:55.000,01:49:56.875,- Say again.
01:49:56.917,01:50:00.166,Okay.
01:50:02.500,01:50:05.709,"Okay, I'm bringing up the guidance."
01:50:06.875,01:50:08.375,Here we go.
01:50:10.542,01:50:12.667,C.M.C. attitude I.M.U.
01:50:12.709,01:50:15.792,C.M.C. source.
01:50:15.834,01:50:20.083,"C.M.C. mode, auto, and we're on the computer."
01:50:28.000,01:50:30.083,Ken?
01:50:30.125,01:50:32.583,Go ahead.
01:50:33.750,01:50:35.417,Up and running.
01:50:35.458,01:50:37.000,How do we look?
01:50:41.834,01:50:42.875,John?
01:50:46.375,01:50:48.583,"I think we got it, buddy."
01:50:59.166,01:51:03.083,"Arthur, uh, my notes are clear on that last sequence, right?"
01:51:03.125,01:51:04.875,"Excuse me, gentlemen."
01:51:07.375,01:51:09.417,I'll-- I'll let you know.
01:51:09.458,01:51:11.917,Here's Ken.
01:51:11.959,01:51:14.041,"It's good to see you, Ken."
01:51:14.083,01:51:15.959,This is the sequence.
01:51:16.000,01:51:18.083,on the hardware yet?
01:51:20.291,01:51:21.458,"Aquarius, Houston."
01:51:21.500,01:51:23.583,Do you read?
01:51:23.625,01:51:25.750,"Yeah, we read you, Ken."
01:51:28.041,01:51:30.333,Are the flowers blooming in Houston?
01:51:30.375,01:51:35.041,"Uh, that's a negative, Jim."
01:51:39.166,01:51:41.667,"Jim, is, uh, Jack in there with you?"
01:51:41.709,01:51:44.750,"Uh, yeah, stand by one."
01:51:44.792,01:51:47.750,Put those on the table.
01:51:47.792,01:51:50.125,I think it would really help if you could...
01:51:50.166,01:51:54.959,just distract her when the heavy predictions come in.
01:51:55.000,01:51:57.875,"Yeah, yeah."
01:51:57.917,01:51:59.917,"Um, Blanch."
01:51:59.959,01:52:03.291,"Blanch, these nice, young men are gonna watch the television with you."
01:52:03.333,01:52:07.041,"This is Neil Armstrong, and this is Buzz Aldrin."
01:52:07.083,01:52:12.417,Hi.
01:52:12.458,01:52:16.458,"Okay, uh, Jack, give me a read-back on that last procedure."
01:52:16.500,01:52:18.542,"Uh, stand by, Ken."
01:52:21.959,01:52:26.583,"Ken, I'm, uh-- Well, I'm having trouble reading my own writing."
01:52:26.625,01:52:28.959,I guess I'm a little more tired than I thought.
01:52:34.917,01:52:37.291,"Uh, don't worry, Jack."
01:52:40.083,01:52:42.959,"Okay, uh, find the main bus breakers on panel 11."
01:52:44.625,01:52:46.625,"Yeah, main bus breakers."
01:52:46.667,01:52:48.709,Got it.
01:52:57.041,01:53:00.667,"Uh, Ken, there's an awful lot of condensation on these panels."
01:53:00.709,01:53:02.917,What's the word on these things shorting out?
01:53:08.417,01:53:10.875,"Uh, we'll just, uh, take that one at a time, Jack."
01:53:13.542,01:53:16.458,It's like tryin' to drive a toaster through a car wash.
01:53:24.917,01:53:26.875,Main bus B is closed.
01:53:26.917,01:53:29.625,"Okay, 13, we're coming up on entry interface."
01:53:29.667,01:53:33.291,still shallowing up a bit in the reentry corridor.
01:53:33.333,01:53:35.709,It's almost like they're underweight.
01:53:35.750,01:53:38.667,Now how could they be underweight?
01:53:40.625,01:53:43.208,Rocks?
01:53:43.250,01:53:45.208,"Uh, one more thing, Jim."
01:53:45.250,01:53:50.500,"While Jack's working on the power-up, we'd like you and Freddo to transfer some ballast over to the command module."
01:53:50.542,01:53:52.625,"Uh, say again, Houston."
01:53:52.667,01:53:56.333,"Uh, that's affirm. Uh, we got to get the weight right."
01:53:56.375,01:53:59.542,We were expecting you to be toting a couple hundred pounds of moon rocks.
01:53:59.583,01:54:01.709,"Right, Houston."
01:54:01.750,01:54:03.875,"Yeah, go ahead, Ken."
01:54:03.917,01:54:07.083,"Okay, now, uh, panel five."
01:54:07.125,01:54:12.041,Circuit breaker caution and warning main B closed.
01:54:12.083,01:54:14.583,Main B closed.
01:54:14.625,01:54:17.417,Master alarm off.
01:54:17.458,01:54:21.542,"Okay, Jack, uh, on panel seven, B-MAG number two, power to warm-up."
01:54:21.583,01:54:24.125,"B-MAG number two, power to warm-up done."
01:54:24.166,01:54:27.125,Sequential logic one and two on.
01:54:27.166,01:54:30.583,Sequential logic... two on.
01:54:30.625,01:54:33.417,C.M.R.C.S. pressure on.
01:54:33.458,01:54:35.500,C.M.R.C.S. pressurization.
01:54:35.542,01:54:41.917,"prepares to jettison his lunar module lifeboat, Marilyn Lovell waits with her children, her neighbors..."
01:54:41.959,01:54:46.625,"and, we are told, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin."
01:54:46.667,01:54:49.500,"Only the Lovell's eldest son, Jay, is absent..."
01:54:49.542,01:54:51.750,as he holds vigil with his classmates...
01:54:51.792,01:54:55.208,at the St. John's Military Academy in Wisconsin.
01:54:55.250,01:54:58.542,ABC News science editor Jules Bergman.
01:54:58.583,01:55:03.834,"With a crippled command module and surviving by using the LEM's systems, there can be no easy maneuver."
01:55:03.875,01:55:07.417,And their LEM lifeboat is doing things and working longer...
01:55:07.458,01:55:09.041,than it was ever intended to.
01:55:09.083,01:55:11.542,It's a race against time until splashdown.
01:55:11.583,01:55:14.333,"Okay, Jack, we're ready to see if the computer will accept..."
01:55:14.375,01:55:17.166,uplink of the reentry data now.
01:55:17.208,01:55:19.291,"Okay, the I.M.U. is up."
01:55:19.333,01:55:22.125,We got our eight-balls back.
01:55:22.166,01:55:27.125,"Okay, Ken, uh, uplink telemetry, command module to accept, right?"
01:55:27.166,01:55:30.166,That's affirm.
01:55:31.709,01:55:33.625,Come on.
01:55:50.208,01:55:51.750,Uplink completed.
01:55:57.291,01:55:59.250,Yeah. That's more like it.
01:55:59.291,01:56:00.917,Yeah.
01:56:00.959,01:56:02.667,Take a look at your amps.
01:56:06.000,01:56:08.083,"We got her back up, Ken."
01:56:08.125,01:56:10.208,"Boy, I wish you were here to see it."
01:56:10.250,01:56:12.000,I'll bet you do.
01:56:15.083,01:56:17.166,"Way to go, Jack."
01:56:22.166,01:56:24.333,"Flight, this is RETRO."
01:56:24.375,01:56:26.959,"Flight, we are looking at a typhoon warning..."
01:56:27.041,01:56:30.166,on the edge of the prime recovery zone.
01:56:30.208,01:56:32.667,"Flight, we are looking at a typhoon warning..."
01:56:32.709,01:56:34.709,on the edge of the prime recovery area.
01:56:34.750,01:56:36.834,"Now, this is just a warning, Flight."
01:56:36.875,01:56:39.542,Only if their luck changes.
01:56:39.583,01:56:41.834,"Jim, we're ready for S.M. jettison!"
01:56:43.083,01:56:45.583,"All right, Jack, on three!"
01:56:45.625,01:56:47.417,One...
01:56:47.458,01:56:48.959,two...
01:56:49.000,01:56:52.166,upward thrust.
01:56:52.208,01:56:54.333,Reverse thrust!
01:56:54.375,01:56:56.542,We have service module jettison.
01:56:56.583,01:56:59.542,"Okay, Houston, our service module is free."
01:56:59.583,01:57:01.583,We're gonna take a look at what we have here.
01:57:01.625,01:57:03.542,Copy that.
01:57:07.417,01:57:09.709,There it is.
01:57:09.750,01:57:11.333,Oh.
01:57:13.583,01:57:16.875,we're getting our first look at the service module now.
01:57:16.917,01:57:20.792,One whole side of the spacecraft is missing.
01:57:20.834,01:57:28.375,"Right by the high-gain antennae, a whole panel is blown out, right up-- right up to our heat shield."
01:57:28.417,01:57:31.208,"Uh, copy that, Aquarius."
01:57:31.250,01:57:33.750,It looked like it got the engine bell too.
01:57:38.667,01:57:40.500,"Oh, man. That's incredible."
01:57:43.667,01:57:45.417,The heat shield.
01:57:45.458,01:57:47.542,The heat will build up...
01:57:47.583,01:57:51.625,"to as much as 3,000 or 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit."
01:57:51.667,01:57:55.458,"On a lunar reentry flight, the heat approaches 4,000 degrees."
01:57:55.500,01:57:59.709,Blanch?
01:57:59.750,01:58:01.709,"Yes, he did."
01:58:01.750,01:58:06.917,"If the heat shield is even slightly cracked, the extreme cold could have split it wide open."
01:58:06.959,01:58:10.250,"Worst of all, if the pyrotechnics that control the parachutes..."
01:58:10.291,01:58:19.250,"have been damaged, the chutes may not open at all, causing the spacecraft to hit the water not at a gentle 20 miles per hour, but at a suicidal 300."
01:58:19.291,01:58:21.500,Perhaps never in human history...
01:58:21.542,01:58:25.417,has the entire world been united by such a global drama.
01:58:25.458,01:58:27.959,"In New York City, thousands of people have gathered..."
01:58:28.000,01:58:30.625,to watch updates of the mission in Times Square.
01:58:30.667,01:58:33.500,"Many countries offered help, and the State Department said..."
01:58:33.542,01:58:35.875,it would ask for it if it were needed.
01:58:35.917,01:58:38.959,The House and Senate passed resolutions calling on the American people...
01:58:39.000,01:58:41.250,to pray tonight for the astronauts.
01:58:41.291,01:58:44.583,"In Rome, Pope Paul led 50,000 people..."
01:58:44.625,01:58:47.375,in prayers for the safe return of the astronauts.
01:58:47.417,01:58:49.583,"In Jerusalem, prayers at the Wailing Wall."
01:58:55.667,01:58:58.417,"Uh, it's about time to bail out of this ship, Freddo."
01:59:02.750,01:59:03.917,Freddo?
01:59:06.125,01:59:08.000,You okay?
01:59:08.041,01:59:11.917,"I'm, uh, freezing."
01:59:13.458,01:59:16.291,Can you hold out just a little longer?
01:59:16.333,01:59:19.500,Long as I have to.
01:59:19.542,01:59:23.375,A little bit longer.
01:59:25.792,01:59:30.542,Just a little while longer.
01:59:30.583,01:59:34.041,Open up that hatch.
01:59:34.083,01:59:37.166,It's 80 degrees out there.
01:59:39.917,01:59:44.542,You are a mess.
01:59:44.583,01:59:48.208,"Odyssey, Houston."
01:59:48.250,01:59:50.333,We're closing in on lunar module jettison.
01:59:50.375,01:59:52.709,"As you know, that is time critical."
01:59:52.750,01:59:55.291,We should be making our move into the command module.
01:59:55.333,02:00:02.667,"Let's get that hatch buttoned up, and, when you get a chance, let us know how you're doing."
02:00:02.709,02:00:06.667,"Here, let me give you a hand there, Freddo."
02:00:42.208,02:00:45.166,We're coming up on LEM jettison.
02:00:45.208,02:00:47.750,"Is everyone strapped in, Ken?"
02:00:47.792,02:00:52.291,"Uh, copy that, Flight."
02:00:52.333,02:00:54.625,Stand by.
02:00:54.667,02:00:57.542,Have you got everybody in the Odyssey?
02:00:57.583,02:01:00.542,"Yeah, Ken. I'm gonna check those pyro batteries one more time here."
02:01:01.834,02:01:04.041,"Okay, the pyro batts look good."
02:01:04.083,02:01:06.291,I don't think we're gonna have to tie the other batteries.
02:01:18.959,02:01:21.500,"Sorry, Jack, it's an old habit."
02:01:21.542,02:01:23.166,I'm kind of used to the pilot's seat.
02:01:23.208,02:01:24.542,She's yours to fly.
02:01:30.458,02:01:33.917,I want to double check some reentry procedures...
02:01:33.959,02:01:38.375,"right after we jettison the LEM, which is coming up in 30 seconds."
02:01:38.417,02:01:40.750,What is that?
02:01:40.792,02:01:47.417,"Oh, I was getting a little punchy, and I didn't want to cut the LEM loose with you guys still in it."
02:01:47.458,02:01:49.000,That's good thinking.
02:01:51.667,02:01:53.500,"Stand by, Houston."
02:01:56.250,02:01:58.875,We have lunar module jettison.
02:02:06.709,02:02:08.667,She sure was a good ship.
02:02:10.333,02:02:13.750,"Farewell, Aquarius, and we thank you."
02:02:21.083,02:02:22.291,Mary?
02:02:23.834,02:02:25.625,"It's almost time, honey."
02:02:29.500,02:02:31.583,Flight 9-6-6-4-0-6.
02:02:52.458,02:02:56.667,Let me put it this way.
02:02:52.458,02:03:00.667,"The trajectory may be off, their thrusters may be frozen, their guidance system might be malfunctioning, their heat shield could be cracked..."
02:03:00.709,02:03:03.750,and their parachutes might be three blocks of ice.
02:03:03.792,02:03:05.959,"So clearly, we have some obstacles to overcome."
02:03:06.000,02:03:09.500,"but now I'm asking you, when will we know?"
02:03:09.542,02:03:11.750,"Well, blackout lasts for three minutes."
02:03:11.792,02:03:15.000,"If they're not back in four, we'll know."
02:03:16.500,02:03:21.041,"Velocity now reading 34,802 feet per second."
02:03:21.083,02:03:23.709,"Range to go 2,625 nautical miles."
02:03:23.750,02:03:27.333,"Okay, Ken, we are aligned for reentry."
02:03:27.375,02:03:30.583,"Jim, we're going to need that computer reentry program. Fred, how are the batteries looking?"
02:03:30.625,02:03:34.041,Okay. Batt A looks good.
02:03:34.083,02:03:36.250,Reentry interface in one minute...
02:03:36.291,02:03:40.333,"Batt B, no volts, the amps are okay."
02:03:40.375,02:03:46.375,"Batt C-- Shit, no volts, only two amps."
02:03:46.417,02:03:49.083,It may die before the main chutes open.
02:03:49.125,02:03:52.333,Roger. Let's tie all the batteries onto main A and main B.
02:03:52.375,02:03:56.000,"Flight, they're still shallowing a bit up there."
02:03:56.041,02:03:59.834,Is there anything we can do about it?
02:03:59.875,02:04:02.333,"Then they don't need to know, do they?"
02:04:02.375,02:04:04.709,RETRO says the typhoon is still a presence in the splashdown area?
02:04:04.750,02:04:09.041,Yeah.
02:04:04.750,02:04:11.583,"We got the parachute situation, the heat shield, the angle of trajectory and the typhoon."
02:04:11.625,02:04:15.458,"There's so many variables, I'm a little at a loss-- I know what the problems are."
02:04:15.500,02:04:18.041,This would be the worst disaster NASA's ever experienced.
02:04:18.083,02:04:22.583,"With all due respect, sir, I believe this is going to be our finest hour."
02:04:24.709,02:04:26.041,Yeah.
02:04:35.291,02:04:39.500,Expect entry interface in 45 seconds.
02:04:39.542,02:04:41.792,"And on my mark, your velocity..."
02:04:41.834,02:04:46.375,"will be 35,245 feet per second."
02:04:46.417,02:04:49.875,Mark-- 35 seconds to entry interface.
02:04:52.291,02:04:53.709,Gentlemen...
02:04:56.500,02:04:59.000,it's been a privilege flying with you.
02:05:41.000,02:05:42.875,"Flight, we have loss of radio contact."
02:05:42.917,02:05:44.417,Roger that.
02:05:44.458,02:05:46.792,Expect to regain signal in three minutes.
02:05:50.125,02:05:52.333,It all depends on the heat shield.
02:06:25.959,02:06:28.709,Back to the Iwo Jima and our live cameras there.
02:06:28.750,02:06:34.875,"The navy recovery and rescue helicopters already airborne, circling, waiting for first radar contact."
02:06:34.917,02:06:38.875,on three minutes until time of drogue deployment.
02:06:38.917,02:06:42.709,"- Bill, what time you got?"
02:06:47.458,02:06:51.083,One minute and 30 seconds to end of blackout.
02:06:55.959,02:06:58.709,No reentering ship has ever taken longer...
02:06:58.750,02:07:01.583,than three minutes to emerge from blackout.
02:07:01.625,02:07:05.208,This is the critical moment.
02:07:05.250,02:07:09.125,Will the command module survive the intense heat of reentry?
02:07:09.166,02:07:12.166,"If it doesn't, there'll only be silence."
02:07:12.208,02:07:15.542,"Mommy, you're squishing me."
02:07:15.583,02:07:17.458,It's okay.
02:07:33.542,02:07:37.125,"Okay, Flight, that's three minutes. We are standing by for acquisition."
02:07:37.166,02:07:38.792,Copy that.
02:07:40.625,02:07:43.667,"Odyssey, Houston."
02:07:43.709,02:07:45.750,"Odyssey, this is Houston."
02:07:45.792,02:07:56.458,"Expected time of reacquisition, the time when the astronauts were expected to come out of blackout, has come and gone."
02:07:56.500,02:08:00.083,About all any of us can do now is just listen and hope.
02:08:00.125,02:08:08.625,"We're about to learn whether or not that heat shield, which was damaged, as you remember, by the explosion three days ago, has withstood the inferno of reentry."
02:08:12.291,02:08:15.583,"Odyssey, this is Houston."
02:08:18.250,02:08:20.917,"Odyssey, Houston."
02:08:20.959,02:08:25.333,"Three minutes, 30 seconds."
02:08:25.375,02:08:28.208,"Odyssey, Houston."
02:08:35.875,02:08:38.375,"Odyssey, this is Houston."
02:08:42.709,02:08:45.375,That's four minutes.
02:09:07.166,02:09:10.166,"Odyssey, uh, Houston."
02:09:18.291,02:09:20.917,"Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey."
02:09:20.959,02:09:24.250,It's good to see you again.
02:09:46.166,02:09:49.041,"Odyssey, Houston."
02:09:49.083,02:09:51.458,We're glad to see you.
02:09:51.500,02:09:53.709,"Good job, Ken."
02:10:38.000,02:10:41.250,They made it.
02:10:52.000,02:10:56.041,Lunney.
02:11:22.417,02:11:26.250,"Houston, we're at stable one."
02:11:26.291,02:11:29.083,This is Apollo 13 signing off.
02:11:29.125,02:11:32.125,Good job.
02:12:23.000,02:12:27.959,"Our mission was called a successful failure, in that we returned safely, but never made it to the moon."
02:12:29.333,02:12:35.125,"In the following months, it was determined that a damaged coil built inside the oxygen tank..."
02:12:35.166,02:12:39.250,sparked during our cryo stir and caused the explosion that crippled the Odyssey.
02:12:39.291,02:12:41.375,It was a minor defect...
02:12:41.417,02:12:45.041,that occurred two years before I was even named the flight's commander.
02:12:45.083,02:12:50.959,"Fred Haise was going back to the moon on Apollo 18, but his mission was canceled because of budget cuts."
02:12:51.000,02:12:53.083,He never flew in space again.
02:12:53.125,02:12:56.458,"Nor did Jack Swigert, who left the astronaut corps..."
02:12:56.500,02:12:59.625,and was elected to Congress from the state of Colorado.
02:12:59.667,02:13:03.667,But he died of cancer before he was able to take office.
02:13:03.709,02:13:07.917,Ken Mattingly orbited the moon as command module pilot of Apollo 16...
02:13:07.959,02:13:11.834,"and flew the space shuttle, having never gotten the measles."
02:13:11.875,02:13:17.375,Gene Kranz retired as Director of Flight Operations just not long ago.
02:13:17.417,02:13:21.959,"And many other members of Mission Control have gone on to other things, but some are still there."
02:13:23.125,02:13:25.083,And as for me...
02:13:25.125,02:13:30.041,the seven extraordinary days of Apollo 13 were my last in space.
02:13:30.083,02:13:39.125,"I watched other men walk on the moon and return safely, all from the confines of Mission Control and our house in Houston."
02:13:40.583,02:13:51.667,"I sometimes catch myself looking up at the moon, remembering the changes of fortune in our long voyage, thinking of the thousands of people who worked to bring the three of us home."
02:13:51.709,02:13:54.792,I look up at the moon and wonder...
02:13:54.834,02:13:57.750,when will we be going back...
02:13:57.792,02:13:59.625,and who will that be?
