00:02:44.289,00:02:47.126,I thought I maybe drive into town.
00:02:47.918,00:02:49.586,You want something?
00:02:49.628,00:02:50.712,No.
00:03:21.535,00:03:23.162,INGRID: A hunter?
00:03:24.329,00:03:27.166,"No, they would travel in pairs, I think."
00:03:29.960,00:03:31.086,Come on.
00:03:33.172,00:03:35.049,Come on!
00:03:35.090,00:03:36.341,What's going on?
00:03:41.763,00:03:42.890,You have a gun?
00:03:43.557,00:03:45.684,Why would you have a gun?
00:03:55.027,00:03:56.111,Jack?
00:03:56.486,00:03:57.654,Jack?
00:04:09.750,00:04:10.959,Jack?
00:04:19.259,00:04:20.761,Is he dead?
00:04:24.472,00:04:25.807,Jack?
00:04:25.849,00:04:28.268,Go to the house and call the police.
00:04:30.478,00:04:31.563,Go!
00:07:15.560,00:07:16.728,MAN: Yeah?
00:07:16.770,00:07:18.479,It's Jack. I'm here.
00:07:19.606,00:07:21.441,"What do you mean, here?"
00:07:21.482,00:07:22.401,Rome.
00:07:26.196,00:07:28.740,There is a bar near the main station.
00:07:28.782,00:07:31.285,"Caffe Ligeti, Via Volturna."
00:07:31.326,00:07:32.369,Wait there.
00:08:27.424,00:08:28.675,Jack.
00:08:28.716,00:08:29.717,Pavel.
00:08:30.969,00:08:32.595,It's been a while.
00:08:36.724,00:08:38.018,Who was the girl?
00:08:38.059,00:08:39.478,A friend.
00:08:41.646,00:08:42.730,A friend?
00:08:44.274,00:08:45.692,Who were the Swedes?
00:08:47.277,00:08:50.530,I'm working on that.
00:08:52.240,00:08:53.492,Did she set you up?
00:08:54.534,00:08:56.870,She had nothing to do with it.
00:08:58.997,00:09:00.290,Pity.
00:09:03.043,00:09:05.420,You can't stay here.
00:09:03.043,00:09:08.298,I've made arrangements for you to leave town while I sort this out.
00:09:14.095,00:09:16.264,Take a right outside the bar.
00:09:16.306,00:09:19.642,Then second left.
00:09:19.684,00:09:23.355,You'll find a dark blue Fiat Tempra with Pescara plates.
00:09:25.273,00:09:27.817,I've marked a small town on the map.
00:09:27.859,00:09:29.819,Castelvecchio.
00:09:29.861,00:09:33.114,"Stay there. Lay low, till you get my call."
00:09:35.658,00:09:37.452,Don't talk to anyone.
00:09:39.662,00:09:43.041,"And above all, don't make any friends, Jack."
00:09:44.876,00:09:46.211,You used to know that.
00:15:29.804,00:15:30.889,Buongiorno.
00:15:32.181,00:15:33.516,Buongiorno.
00:15:38.062,00:15:39.063,America.
00:15:39.105,00:15:40.356,"Ah, l'americano."
00:15:40.398,00:15:41.775,"Si, il americano."
00:16:26.110,00:16:28.070,Can I help you?
00:16:28.112,00:16:29.864,I'm no good with machines.
00:16:29.906,00:16:31.950,You are American.
00:16:32.617,00:16:34.285,You speak Italian?
00:16:34.327,00:16:35.745,Poco.
00:16:35.787,00:16:37.580,On vacation?
00:16:37.622,00:16:39.666,A working vacation.
00:16:43.711,00:16:45.254,I'm a photographer.
00:16:45.296,00:16:47.047,Fotografia?
00:16:47.089,00:16:49.133,Che genere di fotografia?
00:16:49.968,00:16:52.720,"Pictures of architecture, landscape..."
00:16:52.762,00:16:54.430,People?
00:16:54.472,00:16:57.308,"Just for publications, for magazines."
00:16:57.350,00:16:59.727,Magazines.
00:17:01.562,00:17:03.230,Different ones.
00:17:04.774,00:17:05.942,Va bene.
00:17:05.984,00:17:08.068,You must share a glass of wine with me.
00:17:08.110,00:17:10.321,Come tonight.
00:17:10.363,00:17:13.407,You want to know the truth about Abruzzo?
00:17:13.449,00:17:15.493,A priest sees everything.
00:18:14.468,00:18:16.054,PAVEL: Yeah?
00:18:16.095,00:18:17.304,It's Jack.
00:18:18.431,00:18:21.267,You don't answer the cell I gave you.
00:18:21.308,00:18:24.228,I'm no good with machines.
00:18:24.270,00:18:26.773,"You don't make this easy for me, Jack."
00:18:28.315,00:18:30.401,I've got a job for you.
00:18:30.443,00:18:32.486,It's a custom fit.
00:18:32.528,00:18:35.823,You don't even have to pull the trigger.
00:18:35.865,00:18:37.075,I'll think about it.
00:18:51.547,00:18:54.133,The quality of the brandy is good.
00:18:56.677,00:18:57.971,Smooth.
00:18:59.472,00:19:02.391,The only good thing to come from the francesi.
00:19:15.362,00:19:17.239,You study our history?
00:19:19.075,00:19:20.159,No.
00:19:22.787,00:19:29.209,You come to Italy to make a guide book and you don't care about history?
00:19:30.920,00:19:32.505,I take pictures.
00:19:34.340,00:19:35.591,Of course.
00:19:37.343,00:19:38.928,You are American.
00:19:40.888,00:19:43.182,You think you can escape history.
00:19:45.392,00:19:47.186,You live for the present.
00:19:48.104,00:19:49.689,"I try to, Father."
00:21:15.108,00:21:16.400,WOMAN: Buongiorno.
00:21:33.960,00:21:35.211,Grazie.
00:21:42.009,00:21:43.094,Grazie.
00:21:58.317,00:21:59.443,Grazie.
00:21:59.485,00:22:00.903,Prego.
00:22:00.945,00:22:02.488,You're welcome.
00:22:06.284,00:22:07.451,"WAITER: Ecco, suo caffe."
00:22:07.493,00:22:08.702,Grazie.
00:22:09.662,00:22:11.247,"Signore, desidera?"
00:22:11.289,00:22:13.415,Si. Caffe lungo...
00:22:13.457,00:22:14.374,WAITER: Un americano.
00:22:14.416,00:22:16.043,Grazie.
00:22:19.463,00:22:20.965,I'm Edward.
00:22:21.423,00:22:22.466,Mathilde.
00:22:31.725,00:22:32.977,Range?
00:22:33.519,00:22:35.313,150-175 meters.
00:22:36.354,00:22:37.315,Time?
00:22:38.398,00:22:40.860,Five seconds.
00:22:41.319,00:22:42.360,Targets?
00:22:42.862,00:22:44.238,One.
00:22:44.280,00:22:45.572,Firing rate?
00:22:45.614,00:22:46.866,Rapid.
00:22:47.700,00:22:49.451,Magazine capacity?
00:22:49.493,00:22:52.621,Large.
00:22:52.663,00:22:55.457,The weapon must be fairly light and compact.
00:22:55.499,00:22:56.834,How compact?
00:22:56.876,00:22:59.461,As compact as possible.
00:22:59.503,00:23:02.589,You want an automatic rifle to fit inside a woman's purse?
00:23:02.631,00:23:04.508,A small vanity case would be permissible.
00:23:05.551,00:23:07.845,A small briefcase would be possible.
00:23:08.386,00:23:09.638,Noise?
00:23:10.097,00:23:11.473,Silencer.
00:23:11.515,00:23:13.475,I can only give you a suppressor.
00:23:13.517,00:23:20.983,It'll dampen the decibels and dislocate the sound source and reduce the muzzle flash.
00:23:21.025,00:23:25.487,"I can't make you silent, but I can make you invisible as long as you're willing to lose some range."
00:23:25.529,00:23:26.822,Two o'clock.
00:23:29.116,00:23:32.078,"Light blue shirt, sunglasses."
00:23:35.039,00:23:36.790,I didn't see him.
00:23:36.832,00:23:38.751,"In any case, I'm alone."
00:23:40.920,00:23:43.005,"Ecco, il suo americano."
00:23:43.047,00:23:44.590,Grazie.
00:23:49.469,00:23:51.931,I can accept a slight loss of range.
00:23:53.307,00:23:57.395,You want a weapon with the firing capacity of a submachine gun and the range of a rifle.
00:23:59.605,00:24:00.773,Can you do it?
00:26:13.072,00:26:14.365,JACK: Clarke.
00:26:14.407,00:26:16.116,Un pacchetto.
00:26:16.867,00:26:18.244,Clarke.
00:29:31.811,00:29:32.979,Grazie.
00:29:33.021,00:29:34.856,See you tonight.
00:30:19.234,00:30:27.867,"All the sheep in my flock are dear to me, but some are dearer than most, especially those that have lost their way."
00:30:29.869,00:30:32.831,Fabio. Meccanico.
00:30:34.500,00:30:38.378,But I think his work is not always legal.
00:30:58.982,00:31:02.861,Did you ever want to be anything but a priest?
00:31:02.902,00:31:07.199,Have you ever wanted to be anything other than a photographer?
00:31:07.949,00:31:09.827,I do what I'm good at.
00:31:10.869,00:31:15.999,"You have the hands of a craftsman, not an artist."
00:31:17.167,00:31:23.632,"You are good with machines, yet you told me just the opposite when we first met."
00:31:24.966,00:31:25.925,Hmm?
00:31:29.722,00:31:33.851,Journalism cannot make you a rich man.
00:31:36.395,00:31:38.605,Perhaps you are rich already?
00:31:43.694,00:31:49.575,A man can be rich if he has God in his heart.
00:31:52.952,00:31:55.873,"I don't think God's very interested in me, Father."
00:33:15.327,00:33:17.120,Fabio.
00:33:17.162,00:33:19.331,I've got some damage to my car.
00:33:26.254,00:33:28.089,JACK: Si.
00:33:28.131,00:33:30.216,I'm taking photographs in the mountains.
00:33:33.595,00:33:35.138,"Okay, okay."
00:33:50.320,00:33:52.948,"No, I need tools for a broken drive shaft."
00:34:05.544,00:34:09.589,"My garage, your garage."
00:34:14.219,00:34:15.554,"Si, grazie."
00:35:30.336,00:35:31.546,Quanto costa?
00:35:35.133,00:35:36.301,Grazie.
00:42:29.630,00:42:31.424,"Hello again, Edward."
00:43:27.980,00:43:31.317,Does this place get many visitors?
00:43:31.359,00:43:33.570,This is the only way to get here.
00:43:34.862,00:43:37.740,Did you check it for footprints and tire tracks?
00:43:37.782,00:43:40.659,"Three days ago I walked the river, both sides."
00:43:41.660,00:43:43.538,Let's check again.
00:44:52.857,00:44:54.567,Rounds?
00:44:54.609,00:44:58.530,"I prepared two kinds, 10 jacketed, 10 expanding."
00:44:59.238,00:45:01.073,I'd like 20 of each.
00:45:01.866,00:45:03.700,And 10 explosive.
00:45:03.742,00:45:06.162,Not a problem.
00:45:06.204,00:45:08.039,Mercury will do very nicely.
00:45:10.749,00:45:12.877,I brought my own target.
00:45:22.136,00:45:23.596,Right there.
00:46:09.475,00:46:11.519,Muzzle velocity?
00:46:11.561,00:46:13.229,About 360 miles an hour.
00:46:13.271,00:46:17.066,That's including 20 miles an hour off for the sound suppression.
00:46:17.942,00:46:18.859,Ruger?
00:46:18.901,00:46:19.985,M14.
00:46:20.945,00:46:22.655,I've not had one before.
00:46:23.406,00:46:24.949,You'll find it easy.
00:46:27.952,00:46:29.912,I've re-balanced it for the weight of the suppressor.
00:46:29.954,00:46:36.168,"The fulcrum's two centimeters forward from the grip, but that shouldn't matter if you're firing, I'm assuming you are, from a fixed position."
00:46:37.169,00:46:38.713,There's no major recoil issues.
00:46:38.755,00:46:41.507,"You should be able to hold any target, even the smallest."
00:47:13.456,00:47:16.793,Go to the flower.
00:47:13.456,00:47:20.212,"Fire into these reeds, say, two steps away from me."
00:47:21.130,00:47:23.633,"Two bursts, five seconds apart."
00:48:20.897,00:48:23.609,The sound suppression is superb.
00:48:23.651,00:48:26.070,I couldn't place the direction of fire.
00:48:31.116,00:48:33.786,I shall require the rounds and the weapon by the first of next month.
00:48:33.828,00:48:36.706,"In the meantime, could you tighten the adjusting screws on the sight?"
00:48:36.748,00:48:39.542,They're too loose.
00:48:39.584,00:48:43.212,It's a briefcase.
00:48:43.254,00:48:44.547,You have a number you prefer?
00:48:45.214,00:48:47.049,014.
00:48:51.011,00:48:52.430,What do you want done with these?
00:49:03.274,00:49:05.025,How thoughtful.
00:49:06.903,00:49:08.738,Asprinio.
00:49:08.780,00:49:11.449,"It's like Moscato, only frizzante."
00:49:11.490,00:49:15.119,It wouldn't look right if the picnic wasn't touched.
00:49:15.160,00:49:16.579,"You chilled the wine, I thought..."
00:49:16.621,00:49:19.749,Had to be chilled.
00:49:26.171,00:49:27.465,Don't move.
00:49:34.931,00:49:36.181,So beautiful.
00:49:38.016,00:49:39.310,It's endangered.
00:49:45.107,00:49:46.442,You like coming here.
00:49:47.944,00:49:49.361,It serves a purpose.
00:49:50.321,00:49:52.740,You've never taken a woman here before?
00:49:52.782,00:49:54.074,No.
00:50:00.289,00:50:03.417,Perhaps you do not have a woman in your life?
00:50:29.819,00:50:32.864,"Thank you, for a lovely day, Mr. Butterfly."
00:51:15.948,00:51:17.157,Sergio Leone.
00:51:17.533,00:51:18.576,Italiano.
00:51:37.970,00:51:39.179,No.
00:54:37.441,00:54:38.483,Si.
00:54:43.321,00:54:47.076,you can't stop thinking about something.
00:54:51.163,00:54:52.497,Or someone.
00:55:17.313,00:55:19.357,You don't have to act.
00:55:20.484,00:55:21.860,Act?
00:55:23.612,00:55:27.616,"You might have to with other clients, but you don't have to with me."
00:55:27.658,00:55:30.452,I want you to be exactly who you are.
00:55:30.494,00:55:33.705,"I came here to get pleasure, not to give it."
00:55:45.592,00:55:47.928,Maybe I pretend very well.
00:55:57.479,00:56:00.691,You give me more tips than the other girls get.
00:56:03.443,00:56:05.779,I don't sleep with the other girls.
00:58:01.812,00:58:03.647,"Ciao, Signor Farfalla."
00:58:03.688,00:58:05.565,How are you?
00:58:05.607,00:58:07.359,This is my friend Anna.
00:58:07.651,00:58:08.568,Hi.
00:58:08.610,00:58:10.070,"Piacere, Anna."
00:58:10.988,00:58:13.782,Do you want to join me for some coffee?
00:58:13.824,00:58:17.995,We're going to see an American movie.
00:58:18.036,00:58:20.456,I would love to go to America.
00:58:22.040,00:58:25.127,But perhaps we can see each other soon?
00:58:26.211,00:58:28.255,On Wednesday I'm free.
00:58:28.797,00:58:30.841,"Okay, I'll be there."
00:58:30.882,00:58:32.217,Where?
00:58:33.802,00:58:35.512,Our usual place?
00:58:36.596,00:58:38.556,Our usual place.
00:58:38.598,00:58:42.436,Where is our usual place?
00:58:51.862,00:58:53.864,Let's go someplace new.
00:58:54.823,00:58:56.367,You can decide.
00:59:00.496,00:59:02.622,Locanda Grapelli?
00:59:02.664,00:59:05.000,"Locanda Grapelli, good food."
00:59:05.042,00:59:06.793,Mmm-hmm. Grapelli.
00:59:06.835,00:59:08.795,See you there?
00:59:08.837,00:59:10.714,At 8:00?
00:59:12.966,00:59:14.843,"ANNA: Arrivederci, Signor Farfalla."
00:59:14.885,00:59:16.845,"Anna, it's nice to meet you."
01:01:40.447,01:01:41.490,JACK: Fuck.
01:03:31.516,01:03:32.559,Yeah?
01:03:32.601,01:03:34.603,JACK: The Swedes found me.
01:03:35.353,01:03:36.854,Stay put.
01:03:36.896,01:03:38.273,Finish the job.
01:03:38.315,01:03:40.400,How the fuck did they know I was here?
01:03:41.943,01:03:44.488,"Because you've lost your edge, Jack."
01:05:06.570,01:05:08.321,FATHER BENEDETTO: Buongiorno!
01:05:08.363,01:05:09.865,You're up early!
01:05:10.156,01:05:11.867,I needed some air.
01:05:13.493,01:05:15.704,I walk here to meditate.
01:05:15.746,01:05:27.006,"I thank God for certain favors he has granted me, and I ask him to look after those of my friends who are sinners."
01:05:30.552,01:05:32.763,All men are sinners.
01:05:32.804,01:05:35.599,Some are greater sinners than others.
01:05:35.640,01:05:40.937,But those who seek peace have much sinning in their history.
01:05:41.979,01:05:43.774,Maybe.
01:05:43.815,01:05:52.990,"Forgive me, this is the priest in me speaking, but you have done much sinning, Signor Clarke."
01:05:53.909,01:05:56.536,And you still do.
01:05:58.955,01:06:02.667,Something happened here last night.
01:06:05.169,01:06:07.964,"Everything I've done, I've had good cause to do."
01:06:08.005,01:06:09.591,Do you wish to tell me?
01:06:09.633,01:06:10.926,To confess?
01:06:12.009,01:06:13.303,For what reason?
01:06:13.344,01:06:15.472,For your own sake.
01:06:15.513,01:06:17.056,Perhaps I can pray for you?
01:06:17.098,01:06:18.767,Perhaps.
01:06:20.059,01:06:24.314,FATHER BENEDETTO: I wonder how many bastards have been made here.
01:06:27.943,01:06:30.445,You work in metal.
01:06:30.487,01:06:34.449,"You were given some steel by Fabio, the car doctor."
01:06:36.326,01:06:38.578,"Where was he conceived, Father?"
01:06:39.329,01:06:41.247,"Fabio, the car doctor."
01:06:42.165,01:06:45.001,Why do you ask me that?
01:06:45.042,01:06:50.674,You have each other's photos.
01:06:50.715,01:06:54.928,"Was he conceived here, under the trees at night, like all the other bastards?"
01:06:56.972,01:06:59.182,"I do not remember, Signor."
01:07:01.518,01:07:04.020,It was many years ago.
01:07:07.774,01:07:11.319,In the end it is I who confesses to you.
01:07:11.361,01:07:13.446,Do you want me to do the same?
01:07:13.488,01:07:15.031,For your own good.
01:07:16.282,01:07:20.203,You cannot doubt the existence of Hell.
01:07:21.204,01:07:24.081,It is a place without love.
01:07:24.123,01:07:28.211,Perhaps I have no right to wear these robes.
01:07:28.252,01:07:32.007,But I do have a heart full of a father's love.
01:07:33.550,01:07:36.803,Something close to his heart!
01:07:38.262,01:07:42.308,And for that I am both grateful and happy.
01:07:48.064,01:07:51.651,"What do you have, my friend?"
01:08:37.238,01:08:38.281,Ciao.
01:08:40.784,01:08:44.120,I was not sure you were coming.
01:08:44.161,01:08:45.872,I wasn't sure you meant me to.
01:08:45.914,01:08:47.290,Certo che si.
01:08:53.880,01:08:56.132,Buonasera. Buonasera.
01:08:56.173,01:08:57.258,Grazie.
01:08:57.968,01:09:00.011,Prego.
01:09:00.678,01:09:01.721,Grazie.
01:09:08.269,01:09:09.729,"No, grazie."
01:09:43.888,01:09:46.307,Can I ask you something?
01:09:50.687,01:09:52.022,Are you married?
01:09:54.732,01:09:56.317,No.
01:09:59.696,01:10:02.115,I was sure this was your secret.
01:10:02.157,01:10:04.283,Why do I have to have a secret?
01:10:07.078,01:10:09.246,"You're a good man, but..."
01:10:10.456,01:10:12.959,...you have a secret.
01:10:17.047,01:10:18.464,MAN: Mi scusi.
01:10:18.506,01:10:20.299,"No, no, da vero."
01:10:20.341,01:10:22.010,Grazie. No.
01:10:22.052,01:10:23.678,He thinks we are a couple.
01:10:23.720,01:10:24.888,That's okay.
01:10:24.929,01:10:26.056,MAN: Grazie.
01:10:26.097,01:10:27.140,Grazie.
01:14:55.116,01:14:56.784,PAVEL: Pronto.
01:14:56.826,01:14:57.952,I need some more time.
01:15:00.079,01:15:02.539,You're testing my patience.
01:15:02.581,01:15:04.750,Just give me a few more days.
01:15:07.462,01:15:10.256,"You'll get two days, then you make a drop."
01:15:56.511,01:15:57.636,CLARA: Ciao.
01:15:58.262,01:15:59.305,Ciao.
01:16:08.105,01:16:09.357,CLARA: Where we go?
01:16:10.191,01:16:11.650,Someplace beautiful.
01:16:16.531,01:16:18.241,A picnic.
01:16:18.282,01:16:20.159,Yeah. A picnic.
01:16:21.618,01:16:24.247,I have to practice my English.
01:16:24.288,01:16:28.459,"Today, we are going to have a picnic."
01:16:28.876,01:16:30.627,It is a beautiful day.
01:17:01.576,01:17:02.868,CLARA: Where we go?
01:17:04.203,01:17:05.621,JACK: You'll see.
01:17:13.796,01:17:17.216,I think it's good we stay close to the road.
01:17:17.258,01:17:21.678,Don't worry. I've been this way many times taking photographs.
01:17:38.195,01:17:39.614,Only you come here?
01:17:40.448,01:17:41.657,Yes.
01:17:55.004,01:17:56.297,Wow.
01:17:57.214,01:17:58.715,CLARA: Un paradiso.
01:18:10.603,01:18:12.605,I'm going to swim in the water.
01:18:12.647,01:18:13.772,You come?
01:18:13.814,01:18:15.399,It's cold.
01:18:16.692,01:18:17.860,Maybe.
01:18:28.078,01:18:29.455,CLARA: Come!
01:18:33.250,01:18:35.252,"Come, Mr. Farfalla."
01:18:36.420,01:18:37.963,"It's beautiful, no?"
01:18:46.055,01:18:48.224,We make love in the water?
01:18:54.021,01:18:55.398,What's wrong?
01:18:56.273,01:18:57.608,We should have our lunch.
01:18:57.650,01:18:59.109,Ah! Ah.
01:19:02.697,01:19:04.615,Look. It's a bullet.
01:19:05.658,01:19:06.909,Maybe the hunters are here.
01:19:06.950,01:19:08.285,I don't think so.
01:19:12.248,01:19:13.624,I'm cold.
01:19:41.360,01:19:42.653,Edward.
01:19:45.114,01:19:46.990,Is that your real name?
01:20:09.972,01:20:12.182,Will you put this behind me?
01:20:17.313,01:20:18.773,What?
01:20:21.984,01:20:23.527,What?
01:20:29.032,01:20:29.825,Nothing.
01:20:44.298,01:20:46.049,Grazie.
01:20:46.091,01:20:49.178,I just don't understand what the hell you're doing with a gun.
01:20:49.219,01:20:50.887,A friend of mine give to me.
01:20:50.929,01:20:53.557,"The two prostitutes were killed in Pescara, right?"
01:20:53.599,01:20:55.934,Did you see what they do to them?
01:20:55.976,01:20:57.894,The police showed me the photographs.
01:20:57.936,01:20:59.563,I want to feel safe with clients.
01:20:59.605,01:21:01.148,Does it make you feel safe with me?
01:21:01.190,01:21:02.483,You're not a client.
01:21:02.525,01:21:03.818,Then why is it in your bag?
01:21:03.859,01:21:05.820,Because I work tonight.
01:21:20.584,01:21:22.002,There's a processione.
01:21:23.045,01:21:24.004,A procession?
01:21:24.797,01:21:27.049,Yes. Tomorrow.
01:21:28.384,01:21:30.135,In Castel del Monte.
01:21:31.928,01:21:33.848,We go to this together?
01:21:34.973,01:21:36.225,Maybe.
01:21:36.767,01:21:38.060,Really?
01:21:39.854,01:21:41.689,And after...
01:21:41.731,01:21:45.942,"After that, after tomorrow, and the next day..."
01:21:46.902,01:21:49.196,"I can't stay forever, Clara."
01:21:59.206,01:22:00.541,It's time to go home.
01:22:00.583,01:22:02.585,Take me home with you.
01:22:28.903,01:22:30.320,Stay forever.
01:22:53.135,01:22:54.177,PAVEL: Yeah?
01:22:56.012,01:22:58.181,I'll make the delivery and then I'm out.
01:23:02.603,01:23:03.854,Pavel?
01:23:09.902,01:23:10.986,"Okay, Jack."
01:23:12.738,01:23:13.864,You're out.
01:23:52.569,01:23:53.696,MATHILDE: Hello?
01:23:53.737,01:23:56.198,"Now, you listen to me carefully."
01:26:48.745,01:26:50.372,Un caffe.
01:26:51.289,01:26:52.415,Due.
01:27:03.927,01:27:06.055,I see you've brought it in with you.
01:27:06.096,01:27:08.306,Everything's here as we agreed.
01:27:09.725,01:27:11.226,What's this?
01:27:12.561,01:27:14.146,Candy for your trip.
01:27:20.318,01:27:22.946,I thought you might have a sweet tooth.
01:27:27.409,01:27:29.161,That's very kind of you.
01:27:37.460,01:27:40.589,I guess I'll be reading about this in the Tribune.
01:27:43.466,01:27:44.718,Yes.
01:27:46.053,01:27:47.303,I expect so.
01:28:06.907,01:28:08.992,"I'm just going to the ladies, wait here."
01:29:15.517,01:29:16.392,Okay?
01:29:16.434,01:29:18.228,I'm fine. You?
01:29:18.270,01:29:20.189,Just fine.
01:29:20.230,01:29:22.274,You won't need your gun.
01:29:22.316,01:29:23.733,You never know.
01:29:39.291,01:29:40.709,Final payment.
01:29:45.839,01:29:47.632,Buy yourself a retirement clock.
01:30:13.909,01:30:15.535,"Goodbye, Mr. Butterfly."
01:31:09.423,01:31:10.464,Hello?
01:31:11.300,01:31:13.051,What happened?
01:31:13.093,01:31:15.262,There wasn't the opportunity.
01:31:16.221,01:31:17.555,Find one.
01:31:17.597,01:31:19.433,I'm following him now.
01:33:04.787,01:33:06.122,Boo!
01:33:13.255,01:33:15.424,I was looking for you.
01:33:16.674,01:33:17.800,I'm here.
01:33:18.676,01:33:20.554,What are you doing tonight?
01:33:20.594,01:33:22.305,I work tonight.
01:33:22.764,01:33:23.806,Don't.
01:33:29.896,01:33:31.898,"If I ask you to come away with me, would you?"
01:33:33.191,01:33:34.901,Come away with you?
01:33:36.361,01:33:37.571,Why not?
01:33:43.159,01:33:44.827,Together?
01:33:44.869,01:33:46.371,Forever?
01:33:46.413,01:33:47.705,Forever.
01:33:52.877,01:33:54.463,Io ti amo.
01:33:54.504,01:33:55.589,Ti amo.
01:33:55.629,01:33:56.714,Ti amo.
01:34:01.677,01:34:04.055,I want you to take this and meet me at the river.
01:34:04.973,01:34:06.640,Eduardo.
01:34:28.830,01:34:30.248,Who do you work for?
01:34:32.208,01:34:33.335,Who?
01:34:34.668,01:34:41.926,"Same man as you, Jack."
01:35:08.244,01:35:09.871,"I'm sorry, Father."
01:39:22.832,01:39:24.333,Eduardo!
01:39:25.126,01:39:26.461,Eduardo!
01:39:27.211,01:39:28.463,Eduardo!
