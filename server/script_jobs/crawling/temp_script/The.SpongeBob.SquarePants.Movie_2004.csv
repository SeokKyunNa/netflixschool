00:01:05.232,00:01:07.526,Dinghy ahoy.
00:01:08.318,00:01:10.362,Dinghy off the port bow.

00:01:12.573,00:01:14.157,Dinghy off the port bow!
00:01:15.659,00:01:18.037,"Captain, Dinghy off the-- Dinghy."
00:01:19.162,00:01:21.040,I got it!
00:01:26.294,00:01:27.671,I got it.
00:01:29.924,00:01:31.508,Where is it?
00:01:31.592,00:01:33.886,"It's right here, captain."
00:01:37.514,00:01:40.851,I never thought I'd see it with me own eye.
00:01:43.437,00:01:46.440,Tickets to The SpongeBob Movie!
00:01:49.443,00:01:52.112,Yah!
00:02:49.711,00:02:52.255,"So mysterious, so beautiful."
00:02:52.339,00:02:53.882,So...
00:02:53.966,00:02:56.051,wet.
00:02:56.135,00:03:03.182,"Our story begins in Bikini Bottom's popular undersea eatery The Krusty Krab restaurant, -where-- -Back up! Back up!"
00:03:05.226,00:03:06.394,What is happening?!
00:03:06.478,00:03:07.729,"Please, settle down."
00:03:07.813,00:03:12.151,We've got a situation in there I'd rather not discuss till me manager gets here.
00:03:18.782,00:03:20.367,"Talk to me, Krabs."
00:03:20.450,00:03:24.579,Oh! It started out as a simple order: a Krabby Patty with cheese.
00:03:24.663,00:03:28.458,"When the customer took a bite, no cheese!"
00:03:31.045,00:03:32.671,"Get ahold of yourself, Eugene."
00:03:32.754,00:03:34.631,I'm goin' in.
00:03:35.799,00:03:36.842,"Take it easy, friend."
00:03:36.925,00:03:39.636,I'm the manager of this establishment.
00:03:39.720,00:03:41.889,Everything's gonna be just fine.
00:03:41.972,00:03:43.974,"I'm really scared here, man."
00:03:44.058,00:03:45.184,You got a name?
00:03:45.266,00:03:46.434,Phil.
00:03:46.518,00:03:47.519,"You got a family, Phil?"
00:03:50.064,00:03:53.233,"Come on, Phil, stay with me. Let's hear about that family."
00:03:53.316,00:03:56.444,I got a wife and two beautiful children.
00:03:56.528,00:03:58.072,That's what it's all about.
00:03:58.155,00:04:00.199,"I want you to do me a favor, Phil."
00:04:00.281,00:04:01.533,What?
00:04:01.616,00:04:03.368,Say cheese.
00:04:17.507,00:04:18.633,Order up.
00:04:24.264,00:04:25.224,Hip! Hip!
00:04:26.516,00:04:27.392,Hip! Hip!
00:04:28.602,00:04:29.519,Hip! Hip!
00:04:36.443,00:04:37.945,Hooray!
00:04:38.028,00:04:41.156,"Gary, I had that dream again."
00:04:41.240,00:04:44.325,And it's finally gonna come true. Today!
00:04:44.409,00:04:45.786,"Sorry about this, calendar."
00:04:45.869,00:04:53.501,"Because today's the grand-opening ceremony for The Krusty Krab 2, where Mr. Krabs will announce the new manager."
00:04:54.628,00:04:56.546,"Who's it gonna be, Gary?"
00:04:57.798,00:05:03.553,"Well, let's ask my wall of 374 consecutive employee-of-the-month awards."
00:05:11.352,00:05:50.058,SOAP TOOTHY TOOTHPASTE Cleanliness is next to manager-liness.
00:06:14.373,00:06:16.960,SpongeBob! What are you doing in here?
00:06:17.044,00:06:19.087,"I have to tell you something, Squidward."
00:06:19.171,00:06:22.465,"Whatever it is, can't it wait until we get to work?"
00:06:22.549,00:06:24.176,There's no shower at work.
00:06:24.259,00:06:25.384,What do you want?
00:06:25.468,00:06:29.681,I just wanted to say I'll be thanking you in my managerial acceptance speech today.
00:06:32.809,00:06:35.562,Okay. I'll see you at the ceremony.
00:06:35.645,00:06:39.482,That sounds like the manager of the new Krusty Krab 2.
00:06:39.566,00:06:41.068,Oops. Hold on.
00:06:41.735,00:06:43.737,"Congratulations, buddy."
00:06:43.820,00:06:44.988,"Oh, thanks, Patrick."
00:06:45.072,00:06:49.326,"And tonight, after my big promotion, we're gonna party till we're purple."
00:06:49.408,00:06:50.869,I love being purple!
00:06:50.952,00:06:53.830,We're going to the place where all the action is.
00:06:53.914,00:06:56.415,-You don't mean...? -I mean.
00:07:02.214,00:07:16.228,Goofy Goober Theme Song I better get going.
00:07:19.940,00:07:21.024,"Good luck, SpongeBob."
00:07:21.108,00:07:22.859,"Hey, look for me at the ceremony."
00:07:22.943,00:07:25.486,I got a little surprise for you.
00:07:28.489,00:07:30.284,"Hello, Bikini Bottom!"
00:07:30.367,00:07:39.793,"Perch Perkins here, coming to you live from in front of The Krusty Krab restaurant, for years the only place to get a delicious and mouthwatering Krabby Patty."
00:07:39.876,00:07:41.836,"Until today, that is."
00:07:41.920,00:07:43.213,"That's right, folks."
00:07:43.297,00:07:49.386,Longtime owner Mr. Krabs is opening a new restaurant called The Krusty Krab 2.
00:07:51.096,00:07:53.932,"First of all, congratulations, Mr. Krabs."
00:07:54.015,00:07:55.976,Hello. I like money.
00:07:56.059,00:08:01.648,What inspired you to build a second Krusty Krab right next door to the original?
00:08:01.731,00:08:02.649,Money.
00:08:06.694,00:08:08.405,It's not fair.
00:08:08.488,00:08:14.328,"Krabs is being interviewed by Perch Perkins, and I've never even had one customer!"
00:08:22.085,00:08:25.213,"Don't get worked up again, Plankton, I just mopped the floors."
00:08:25.297,00:08:35.098,"Oh, Karen, my computer wife, if only I could have managed to steal the secret to Krabs' success, the formula for the Krabby Patty."
00:08:37.934,00:08:40.728,Then people would line up to eat at my restaurant.
00:08:40.812,00:08:44.274,Lord knows I've tried.
00:08:44.358,00:08:47.652,I've exhausted every evil plan in my filing cabinet...
00:08:47.819,00:08:50.697,EVIL PLANS ...from A to Y.
00:08:50.780,00:08:52.115,A to Y?
00:08:52.199,00:08:54.326,"Yeah, A to Y. You know, the alphabet."
00:08:54.409,00:08:55.910,What about Z?
00:08:55.994,00:08:57.412,Z?
00:08:57.496,00:09:00.790,Z. The letter after Y.
00:09:00.874,00:09:03.210,"W, X, Y, Z."
00:09:03.293,00:09:04.294,Plan Z!
00:09:04.378,00:09:06.505,"Here it is, just like you said."
00:09:06.587,00:09:07.714,"Oh, boy."
00:09:11.718,00:09:13.553,It's evil.
00:09:13.636,00:09:15.596,It's diabolical.
00:09:16.890,00:09:18.599,It's lemon-scented.
00:09:18.683,00:09:22.145,This Plan Z can't possibly fail!
00:09:22.229,00:09:29.027,"So enjoy today, Mr. Krabs, because by tomorrow, I'll have the formula."
00:09:29.110,00:09:33.865,"Then everyone will eat at the Chum Bucket, and I will rule the world!"
00:09:33.948,00:09:35.616,All hail Plankton.
00:09:35.700,00:09:43.500,All hail Plank-- I think I stepped in something.
00:09:47.045,00:09:51.174,"Not in something, on someone, you twit!"
00:09:51.758,00:09:53.009,"Sorry, Plankton."
00:09:53.093,00:09:55.345,Are you on your way to the grand-opening ceremony?
00:09:59.474,00:10:03.353,I'm busy planning to rule the world!
00:10:06.356,00:10:07.524,"Well, good luck with that."
00:10:11.903,00:10:14.531,Stupid kid.
00:10:14.614,00:10:20.787,"Welcome! Welcome, everyone, to the grand opening of The Krusty Krab 2."
00:10:22.497,00:10:24.583,We paid nine dollars for this?
00:10:24.665,00:10:26.042,I paid ten.
00:10:26.126,00:10:32.048,"Now, before we begin with the ribbon-cuttin', I'd like to announce the name of our new manager."
00:10:37.178,00:10:39.722,Yeah! Now we're talking! Yeah!
00:10:43.101,00:10:44.394,"Yes. Well, anyway..."
00:10:44.478,00:10:49.190,"The new manager is a loyal, hard-working employee..."
00:10:50.484,00:10:52.860,...the obvious choice for the job...
00:10:52.944,00:10:54.237,He's right.
00:10:54.321,00:10:56.030,...a name you all know.
00:10:56.114,00:10:57.824,It starts with an S.
00:10:57.907,00:10:58.825,That's me.
00:10:58.908,00:11:02.454,Please welcome our new manager...
00:11:02.537,00:11:04.498,Squidward Tentacles!
00:11:04.581,00:11:05.915,Yes!
00:11:05.999,00:11:07.542,Yeah!
00:11:07.626,00:11:08.585,Ya!
00:11:08.668,00:11:11.630,"Oh, better luck next time, buddy."
00:11:15.509,00:11:17.010,Yeah! All right!
00:11:21.389,00:11:24.225,as the manager of-- SpongeBob?
00:11:24.309,00:11:27.728,"Hold the phone, folks, I'm getting an important news flash from Mr. Krabs."
00:11:27.812,00:11:28.729,"Go ahead, Mr. K."
00:11:30.898,00:11:32.900,I'm making a complete what of myself?
00:11:35.028,00:11:37.489,The most embarrassing thing you've ever seen?
00:11:38.739,00:11:45.664,"And now it's worse because I'm repeating everything you say Oh, for crying out loud, SpongeBob!"
00:11:45.746,00:11:47.499,You didn't get the job!
00:11:47.582,00:11:48.500,What?
00:11:48.583,00:11:49.626,You...
00:11:49.708,00:11:50.709,did not...
00:11:50.793,00:11:51.752,get...
00:11:51.836,00:11:52.753,the job.
00:11:52.837,00:11:54.589,I...
00:11:54.673,00:11:55.882,But why?
00:11:55.965,00:11:57.842,SpongeBob...
00:11:57.925,00:11:59.802,"you're a great fry cook, but..."
00:11:59.886,00:12:05.099,I gave the job to Squidward because being manager is a big responsibility.
00:12:05.183,00:12:09.812,"Well, let's face it, he's more, mature than you."
00:12:09.896,00:12:11.314,I'm not...
00:12:11.398,00:12:12.357,mature?
00:12:12.440,00:12:13.567,Lad...
00:12:13.650,00:12:21.575,"I mean this in the nicest of ways, but there's a word for what you are, and that word is, now, let's see..."
00:12:21.658,00:12:22.659,Dork?
00:12:22.741,00:12:24.035,"No, wait, that's not right."
00:12:24.118,00:12:25.537,Not a dork.
00:12:25.620,00:12:26.705,A goofball?
00:12:26.787,00:12:28.540,"Closer, but no, no, no."
00:12:28.623,00:12:29.499,A ding-a-ling.
00:12:29.583,00:12:30.542,Wing nut.
00:12:30.625,00:12:32.126,A Knucklehead McSpazatron.
00:12:32.210,00:12:33.794,"Okay, that's enough!"
00:12:33.878,00:12:38.174,"Look, what I'm trying to say is, you're just a kid."
00:12:38.258,00:12:41.344,"And to be a manager, you have to be a man."
00:12:41.428,00:12:43.804,Otherwise they'd call it kid-ager.
00:12:43.888,00:12:46.140,You understand-ager? I mean...
00:12:46.224,00:12:47.975,you understand?
00:12:48.059,00:12:50.228,"I guess so, Mr. Krabs."
00:12:52.647,00:12:53.940,SpongeBob?
00:13:01.364,00:13:02.365,Poor kid.
00:13:02.449,00:13:05.034,Hooray for SpongeBob!
00:13:10.123,00:13:13.418,Hooray for SpongeBob!
00:13:17.631,00:13:20.049,Let's hear it for SpongeBob!
00:13:20.133,00:13:21.301,Hello?
00:13:21.384,00:13:23.802,Where'd everybody go?
00:13:23.886,00:13:26.765,Did I miss something?
00:13:26.847,00:13:29.559,Did you see my butt?
00:13:33.229,00:13:37.358,Time to put Plan Z into effect.
00:13:37.442,00:13:41.780,Starting at the undersea castle of King Neptune.
00:13:55.001,00:13:56.210,"Oh, right."
00:13:56.294,00:13:59.506,The royal court is now in session.
00:13:59.589,00:14:02.383,Bring the prisoner forward.
00:14:07.305,00:14:11.643,So...you have confessed to the crime of touching the king's crown.
00:14:11.726,00:14:13.894,"Yes, but-- But what?"
00:14:13.978,00:14:15.438,"But it's my job, Your Highness."
00:14:15.522,00:14:17.607,I'm the royal crown polisher.
00:14:17.691,00:14:22.153,"Well, then I guess I can't execute you."
00:14:22.236,00:14:24.698,Twenty years in the dungeon it is.
00:14:24.781,00:14:25.906,Daddy.
00:14:25.990,00:14:27.701,You're free to go.
00:14:28.909,00:14:31.412,"Bless you, Princess Mindy."
00:14:33.414,00:14:36.083,Mindy! How dare you defy me!
00:14:36.167,00:14:38.127,Why do you have to be so mean?
00:14:38.211,00:14:39.504,I am the king!
00:14:39.587,00:14:41.715,I must enforce the laws of the sea!
00:14:41.798,00:14:46.302,"Father, I wish you'd try a little love and compassion instead of these harsh punishments."
00:14:46.386,00:14:48.471,That would be nice.
00:14:48.555,00:14:50.390,"Squire, clear the room."
00:14:50.473,00:14:53.017,I wish to speak to my daughter alone.
00:14:54.477,00:14:56.646,"What is this, Mindy?"
00:14:56.730,00:14:58.022,Your...crown?
00:14:58.105,00:14:59.816,And what does this crown do?
00:14:59.899,00:15:01.818,Covers your bald spot.
00:15:01.901,00:15:03.820,"It's not bald, it's..."
00:15:03.903,00:15:05.029,thinning.
00:15:05.112,00:15:10.618,This crown does much more than cover a slightly receding hairline.
00:15:10.702,00:15:14.997,"No, this crown entitles the one who wears it to be in charge of the sea."
00:15:16.123,00:15:18.835,"One day, you will wear this crown."
00:15:18.918,00:15:20.378,I'm gonna be bald?
00:15:20.461,00:15:21.546,Thinning!
00:15:21.629,00:15:27.968,"Anyway, the point is, you won't wear it until you learn how to rule with an iron fist."
00:15:28.052,00:15:30.137,Like your father.
00:15:31.305,00:15:34.267,Dad? Your crown...
00:15:34.934,00:15:36.644,What the...?
00:15:37.270,00:15:38.438,My crown!
00:15:42.609,00:15:44.360,I got it.
00:15:44.444,00:15:45.445,I got it!
00:15:52.493,00:16:03.212,GOOFY GOOBER'S It's time to say howdy to your favorite undersea peanut...
00:16:03.296,00:16:05.214,Goofy Goober!
00:16:10.637,00:16:13.640,"Hey, fellow Goofy Goobers. Time to sing."
00:16:36.996,00:16:40.416,"All right. Get it together, old boy."
00:16:40.500,00:16:43.795,I know. I'll just stop thinking about it.
00:16:44.712,00:16:47.590,"Hey, you know, I actually feel a little better."
00:16:47.674,00:16:49.592,I don't even remember why I was sad.
00:16:49.676,00:16:53.220,"Hey, it's the new Krusty Krab 2 manager."
00:16:56.641,00:16:59.519,"Wow, the pressure's already setting in."
00:16:59.602,00:17:02.104,"No, Pat, you don't understand."
00:17:02.188,00:17:03.815,I didn't get the promotion.
00:17:03.898,00:17:05.692,What? Why?
00:17:05.775,00:17:08.319,Mr. Krabs thinks I'm a kid.
00:17:08.402,00:17:10.864,What? That's insane!
00:17:10.947,00:17:11.865,I know.
00:17:11.948,00:17:15.284,"Well, saying you're a kid, it's-- It's like saying I'm a kid."
00:17:15.368,00:17:16.786,"Here's your Goober Meal, sir."
00:17:16.870,00:17:19.079,I'm supposed to get a toy with this.
00:17:19.163,00:17:20.164,Thanks.
00:17:21.415,00:17:23.125,"I'm gonna head home, Pat."
00:17:23.209,00:17:25.044,The celebration's off.
00:17:26.212,00:17:27.421,Are you sure?
00:17:27.505,00:17:29.799,Yeah. I'm not in a Goober mood.
00:17:29.883,00:17:31.133,"Okay, see you."
00:17:31.217,00:17:34.554,"And here's your Triple Gooberberry Sunrise, sir."
00:17:35.137,00:17:36.222,Yum!
00:17:36.305,00:17:39.183,Oh. Triple Gooberberry Sunrise?
00:17:39.266,00:17:41.185,I guess I could use one of those.
00:17:41.268,00:17:42.937,Now you're talking.
00:17:43.021,00:17:44.230,"Hey, waiter!"
00:17:44.313,00:17:46.482,We need another one over here.
00:17:46.566,00:17:48.108,There you go.
00:17:58.536,00:18:00.621,"Boy, Pat, that hit the spot."
00:18:00.705,00:18:02.707,I'm feeling better already.
00:18:02.790,00:18:03.833,Yeah.
00:18:03.917,00:18:06.377,"Waiter, let's get another round over here."
00:18:10.423,00:18:13.384,"Oh, Mr. Waiter. Two more, please."
00:18:17.972,00:18:19.724,Waiter.
00:18:21.141,00:18:23.185,"Oh, waiter."
00:18:28.775,00:18:31.193,Why do I always get the nuts?
00:18:31.277,00:18:40.036,"All right, folks, this one goes out to my two bestest friends in the whole world: Patrick and this big peanut guy."
00:18:40.119,00:18:42.371,It's a little ditty called...
00:18:50.630,00:18:51.923,"Hey, get up."
00:18:52.006,00:18:54.092,"Hey, come on, buddy. I wanna go home."
00:18:54.174,00:18:55.802,"Come on, pal."
00:18:58.345,00:19:00.014,"Oh, my head."
00:19:00.098,00:19:02.475,Listen to me. It's eight in the morning.
00:19:02.558,00:19:04.644,Go scrape up your friend and get going.
00:19:05.770,00:19:06.729,...friend?
00:19:08.272,00:19:09.398,"Hey, what's up, buddy?"
00:19:11.233,00:19:13.653,"Wait, you said eight 'o clock."
00:19:13.736,00:19:15.321,I'm late for work.
00:19:15.404,00:19:18.282,Mr. Krabs is gonna be...
00:19:19.158,00:19:21.911,Mr. Krabs.
00:19:23.955,00:19:25.289,"Now, pay attention, Squidward."
00:19:25.372,00:19:29.752,"As new manager, you've gotta keep a sharp eye out for paying customers."
00:19:29.836,00:19:30.670,Yawn.
00:19:32.171,00:19:33.172,What's this?
00:19:33.255,00:19:36.383,King Neptune is riding toward The Krusty Krab at lunchtime.
00:19:36.467,00:19:38.302,He's got money.
00:19:40.680,00:19:42.431,"Stay in the coach, daughter."
00:19:42.515,00:19:44.391,This won't take long.
00:19:44.475,00:19:46.602,"Daddy, please. I think you're overreacting."
00:19:46.686,00:19:49.814,"Silence, Mindy! I know what I'm doing."
00:19:50.857,00:19:52.191,"-Squire. -Yes, Your Highness."
00:19:52.274,00:19:55.111,Have this pole executed at once.
00:19:55.194,00:19:59.198,A hundred and one dollars for a Krabby Patty?
00:19:59.281,00:20:02.409,"With cheese, Mr. Squidward, with cheese."
00:20:06.372,00:20:08.166,"Greetings, subjects."
00:20:08.248,00:20:11.377,I seek the one known as Eugene Krabs.
00:20:11.460,00:20:14.463,May he present himself to me at once.
00:20:14.547,00:20:17.091,"I'm Eugene Krabs, Your Highness."
00:20:17.175,00:20:18.968,Would you like to order something?
00:20:19.052,00:20:20.094,Nay!
00:20:20.178,00:20:22.221,"I'm on to you, Krabs!"
00:20:22.304,00:20:25.641,"You have stolen the royal crown, you cannot deny."
00:20:25.725,00:20:31.271,"For, clever as you are, you left one damning piece of evidence at the scene of the crime."
00:20:31.355,00:20:34.650,"I stole your crown. Signed, Eugene Krabs!"
00:20:34.734,00:20:37.444,Relinquish the royal crown to me at once.
00:20:37.528,00:20:39.572,But-- But this is crazy. I didn't do it.
00:20:41.074,00:20:43.701,"Ahoy, this is Eugene Krabs. Leave a message."
00:20:45.953,00:20:49.498,"This is Clay, the guy you sold Neptune's crown to. Yeah."
00:20:49.582,00:20:52.334,I just wanted to say thanks again for selling me the crown.
00:20:52.418,00:20:53.586,Neptune's crown.
00:20:53.669,00:20:59.008,"I sold it to a guy in Shell City, and I just wanted to say thanks again for selling me the crown."
00:20:59.092,00:21:01.677,Neptune's crown.
00:21:01.761,00:21:03.637,Which is now in Shell City. Goodbye.
00:21:05.806,00:21:07.725,I was-- I just-- Woo-hoo!
00:21:07.808,00:21:10.019,Don't you just hate wrong numbers?
00:21:10.103,00:21:13.189,My crown is in the forbidden Shell City?
00:21:16.275,00:21:19.403,Plan Z. I love Plan Z.
00:21:22.740,00:21:25.201,"Prepare to burn, Krabs."
00:21:29.205,00:21:30.206,I ain't a crook.
00:21:30.289,00:21:33.417,"Ask anyone, they'll vouch for me."
00:21:34.127,00:21:35.461,"Very well, then."
00:21:35.544,00:21:43.385,"Before I turn this conniving crustacean into fishmeal, who here has anything to say about Eugene Krabs?"
00:21:45.263,00:21:48.266,I've got something to say about Mr...
00:21:49.391,00:21:50.893,Krabs.
00:21:51.477,00:21:53.771,"SpongeBob, me boy! Oh, you've come just in time."
00:21:53.854,00:21:55.439,"Pardon me, miss."
00:21:55.522,00:21:58.734,"Please, tell King Neptune all about me."
00:21:58.818,00:22:07.743,I have worked for Mr. Krabs for ma-- Many years and always thought he was a great boss.
00:22:07.827,00:22:09.369,You see? A great boss.
00:22:09.453,00:22:13.916,I now realize that he's a great big jerk!
00:22:15.042,00:22:17.170,I deserve that manager's job!
00:22:17.253,00:22:22.758,"But you didn't give it to me, because you say I'm a kid."
00:22:22.842,00:22:26.971,"Well, I am 100-percent man!"
00:22:27.054,00:22:32.935,And this man has got something to say to you.
00:22:40.734,00:22:41.902,There.
00:22:41.986,00:22:43.821,I think I made my point.
00:22:45.614,00:22:46.949,Anyone else?
00:22:47.033,00:22:48.159,No?
00:22:48.242,00:22:49.994,"Well, then."
00:22:53.831,00:22:56.583,Me pants are on fire!
00:22:56.667,00:22:59.170,Me underwear's on fire!
00:22:59.253,00:23:02.048,I'm on fire!
00:23:03.632,00:23:05.467,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:05.551,00:23:16.812,"And now, Eugene Krabs, you will-- I'm flattered you would do this on my account, but being manager isn't worth killing Mr. Krabs over."
00:23:16.896,00:23:18.314,"Quiet, fool!"
00:23:18.396,00:23:21.734,"Mr. Krabs stole my crown, and now it's in Shell City."
00:23:21.817,00:23:23.652,That's why he must die.
00:23:23.736,00:23:26.488,Doesn't it seem a little harsh to kill someone over a crown?
00:23:26.572,00:23:27.698,You don't understand.
00:23:27.781,00:23:30.659,My crown is a symbol of my king-like authority.
00:23:30.743,00:23:33.495,And between you and me...
00:23:33.579,00:23:34.830,my hair is thinning a bit.
00:23:34.914,00:23:39.210,"Oh, Your Highness, I'm sure it's not that noticea-- Bald! Bald!"
00:23:39.293,00:23:40.294,Bald!
00:23:43.297,00:23:44.590,My eyes!
00:23:44.673,00:23:46.384,"All right, all right."
00:23:46.466,00:23:48.468,"King Neptune, sir?"
00:23:48.552,00:23:51.931,Would you spare Mr. Krabs' life if I went to get your crown back?
00:23:52.014,00:23:54.474,"You, go to Shell City?"
00:24:00.898,00:24:04.484,No one who's gone to Shell City has ever returned.
00:24:04.568,00:24:06.737,What makes you think you could?
00:24:06.820,00:24:09.865,You're just a kid.
00:24:09.949,00:24:12.034,But I'm not a kid. I can do it.
00:24:12.118,00:24:15.121,"Run along, I have a crab to cook."
00:24:16.372,00:24:18.374,No! I won't let you.
00:24:19.625,00:24:20.667,"Very well, then."
00:24:20.751,00:24:23.337,I'll have to fry you both.
00:24:23.837,00:24:25.214,"Daddy, stop it."
00:24:25.298,00:24:28.384,Can't you get through one day without executing someone?
00:24:28.466,00:24:31.220,Mindy. I told you to stay in the carriage.
00:24:31.304,00:24:33.431,Where's your love and compassion?
00:24:33.513,00:24:35.182,Look at this little guy.
00:24:35.266,00:24:38.894,He's willing to risk his life to find your crown and save his boss.
00:24:38.978,00:24:41.563,"But, daughter, I-- Please, Father?"
00:24:41.647,00:24:44.150,At least let him try. What have you got to lose?
00:24:44.233,00:24:47.736,Might I remind you of your...special problem?
00:24:53.159,00:24:54.410,My eyes!
00:24:54.492,00:24:55.953,All right.
00:24:56.036,00:24:58.998,"Very well, Mindy. I'll give him a chance."
00:24:59.081,00:25:05.212,"But when your little champion fails to return, I get to splatter this crab all over the walls."
00:25:06.339,00:25:10.843,"And as for you, be back here with my crown in exactly ten days."
00:25:10.926,00:25:12.428,He can do it in nine.
00:25:12.510,00:25:13.429,-Eight. -Seven.
00:25:16.640,00:25:17.724,"Six it is, then."
00:25:17.808,00:25:18.934,Five.
00:25:19.018,00:25:19.935,"Patrick, shush."
00:25:20.019,00:25:24.564,"Until then, the crab shall remain frozen where he now stands."
00:25:24.648,00:25:27.067,"No, wait. I'm begging you."
00:25:29.028,00:25:30.779,Who turned on the AC?
00:25:30.863,00:25:32.990,Mr. Krabs!
00:25:33.073,00:25:35.493,"Oh, no, this is terrible."
00:25:35.575,00:25:37.119,Who's gonna sign my paycheck?
00:25:37.203,00:25:39.663,"Come along, Mindy."
00:25:39.746,00:25:42.833,"Listen, you guys, the road to Shell City is really dangerous."
00:25:42.916,00:25:45.752,"There's crooks, killers and monsters everywhere."
00:25:45.836,00:25:51.133,"And what's worse, there's a giant Cyclops who guards the outskirts of the city and preys on innocent sea creatures."
00:25:51.217,00:25:56.680,"Don't let him catch you, because if he does, he'll take you back to his lair, and you'll never be seen again."
00:25:56.763,00:25:59.392,"She's purty, SpongeBob."
00:25:59.475,00:26:00.809,"Here, take this."
00:26:00.893,00:26:02.228,What's in here?
00:26:03.187,00:26:04.938,It's a magical bag of winds.
00:26:05.022,00:26:06.648,I stole them from my father.
00:26:06.732,00:26:07.858,You're hot.
00:26:07.941,00:26:11.569,"Once you find the crown, open the bag of winds and you'll be blown back home."
00:26:13.739,00:26:14.656,"Good luck, SpongeBob."
00:26:14.740,00:26:16.909,Wait. How did you know my name?
00:26:16.992,00:26:19.245,"Oh, I'm gonna be queen of the sea one day."
00:26:19.328,00:26:21.330,I've learned the names of all the sea creatures.
00:26:21.414,00:26:22.956,What's my name?
00:26:23.040,00:26:25.376,That's easy. You're Patrick Star.
00:26:27.127,00:26:30.089,Hai-yai-yahee!
00:26:31.173,00:26:33.342,I gotta go. I believe in you guys.
00:26:33.426,00:26:34.634,"Thanks, Mindy."
00:26:34.718,00:26:40.140,"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. Patrick, Squidward and I-- Pass."
00:26:41.767,00:26:43.894,-Patrick and I... -Hi.
00:26:43.977,00:26:47.689,...are gonna get that crown back and save you from Neptune's wrath.
00:26:47.773,00:26:49.775,You've got nothing to worry about.
00:26:49.858,00:26:52.445,Your life is in our hands.
00:26:56.907,00:26:59.617,"Patrick, let's go get that crown."
00:27:15.675,00:27:17.386,"Feast your eyes, Patrick."
00:27:17.470,00:27:19.221,What is it?
00:27:19.972,00:27:21.932,The Patty Wagon.
00:27:22.015,00:27:24.768,Mr. Krabs uses it for promotional reasons.
00:27:24.851,00:27:26.644,Let me show you some of its features.
00:27:26.728,00:27:30.857,"Sesame-seed finish, steel-belted pickles, grilled-leather interior."
00:27:30.941,00:27:32.401,And under the hood...
00:27:32.485,00:27:36.738,a fuel-injected French-fryer with dual overhead grease traps.
00:27:36.822,00:27:37.823,Wow.
00:27:37.906,00:27:40.493,"Yeah, wow."
00:27:41.619,00:27:44.497,"Hey, I thought you didn't have a driver's license."
00:27:44.580,00:27:47.665,You don't need a license to drive a sandwich.
00:27:50.628,00:27:54.047,2-GO KER PATTY!
00:28:07.353,00:28:09.480,"Hey there, old buddy."
00:28:09.563,00:28:10.564,Freeze.
00:28:12.191,00:28:15.319,"One secret formula to go, please."
00:28:15.402,00:28:18.864,"No, no, don't trouble yourself. I'll get it."
00:28:21.116,00:28:26.163,"Well, I'd like to hang around, but I've got Krabby Patties to make..."
00:28:26.246,00:28:27.956,...over at the Chum Bucket.
00:28:28.040,00:28:31.751,"Plan Z, I love ya!"
00:28:51.021,00:28:52.690,"Fill her up, please."
00:28:52.772,00:28:54.983,"What'll it be, fellas?"
00:28:55.067,00:28:57.319,Mustard or ketchup?
00:29:00.406,00:29:02.157,Are they laughing at us?
00:29:02.241,00:29:05.411,"No, Patrick, they're laughing next to us."
00:29:06.412,00:29:08.455,"Where you two dumb kids headed, anyway?"
00:29:08.539,00:29:10.624,"-Kids? -Now, Patrick."
00:29:10.708,00:29:14.587,"For your information, we are not kids, we are men."
00:29:14.670,00:29:18.173,And we're off to get King Neptune's crown in Shell City.
00:29:19.883,00:29:24.971,Ain't that the place that's guarded by a killer Cyclops?
00:29:25.055,00:29:26.223,That's right.
00:29:26.306,00:29:29.268,"Lloyd, take off your hat in respect."
00:29:29.351,00:29:31.853,Respect for the dead!
00:29:38.235,00:29:42.364,You two dipsticks ain't gonna last ten seconds over the county line.
00:29:42.448,00:29:45.618,"Oh, yeah? We'll see about that."
00:29:48.537,00:29:50.623,"Out of the car, fellas."
00:29:56.503,00:29:58.004,How many seconds was that?
00:29:59.089,00:30:01.049,Twelve.
00:30:15.355,00:30:16.732,They're dead.
00:30:21.320,00:30:23.739,Perch Perkins here with an incredible news flash.
00:30:23.822,00:30:26.408,Plankton is selling Krabby Patties at the Chum Bucket.
00:30:26.492,00:30:29.119,How is this possible? Let's find out.
00:30:29.202,00:30:30.829,Step right up.
00:30:30.912,00:30:32.331,Plenty for everybody.
00:30:32.414,00:30:33.373,"Excuse me, Plankton."
00:30:33.457,00:30:34.916,"Perch Perkins, Bikini Bottom News."
00:30:35.000,00:30:36.001,Can I get a minute?
00:30:36.084,00:30:38.378,"Anything for you, Perch."
00:30:38.462,00:30:42.424,"All of Bikini Bottom wants to know, how did you get the Krabby Patty?"
00:30:42.508,00:30:49.055,"Well, Perch, before my dear friend Eugene Krabs was frozen by King Neptune..."
00:30:50.390,00:30:51.391,I'm sorry.
00:30:52.601,00:30:54.936,He confided in me a secret wish.
00:30:55.020,00:30:59.858,"Sell the Krabby Patty in my absence at the Chum Bucket, he said."
00:30:59.941,00:31:02.319,Don't let the flame die out!
00:31:06.615,00:31:10.243,"By the way, act now and you get a free Chum Bucket bucket helmet with every purchase."
00:31:10.327,00:31:11.453,"Here you go, Perch."
00:31:11.537,00:31:12.371,Thanks.
00:31:12.454,00:31:14.914,Bucket helmets for everyone!
00:31:17.417,00:31:19.670,My helmet!
00:31:22.840,00:31:27.803,"Karen, baby, I haven't felt this giddy since the day you agreed to be my wife."
00:31:27.886,00:31:29.221,I never agreed.
00:31:29.304,00:31:32.265,Evil Plan Z is working perfectly.
00:31:32.349,00:31:33.933,Nothing can stop me now.
00:31:34.017,00:31:36.812,Nothing except SpongeBob and his pink friend.
00:31:36.895,00:31:41.817,My sensors indicate that they're going after the crown.
00:31:41.900,00:31:45.821,"If they make it back, Neptune might discover some fingerprints."
00:31:45.904,00:31:48.448,Tiny fingerprints.
00:31:48.532,00:31:51.368,"Stubby, tiny fingerprints."
00:31:51.451,00:31:54.496,"Evil Plan Z is way ahead of you, baby."
00:31:54.580,00:31:58.333,I've already hired someone to take care of those two.
00:31:58.417,00:32:01.461,"He's a vicious, cold-blooded predator!"
00:32:03.463,00:32:19.855,DENNIS I-KILL-U YOUR HEAD HERE Sesame seed.
00:32:21.690,00:32:23.859,Does that hat take ten gallons?
00:32:44.212,00:32:47.173,-Yeah. Yeah. -Going on.
00:32:47.257,00:32:49.259,-Moving on. -Just keep going.
00:32:49.342,00:32:52.930,-Yup. -Gotta get that crown.
00:32:59.185,00:33:02.314,Yeah. Victory.
00:33:02.397,00:33:03.899,Are we there yet?
00:33:03.941,00:33:07.068,We must be close by now.
00:33:07.152,00:33:08.821,"Patrick, look."
00:33:08.904,00:33:10.322,We're doing great!
00:33:10.405,00:33:13.366,Shell City's only five days away.
00:33:16.745,00:33:17.579,Awww...
00:33:17.663,00:33:19.873,I wish we still had our car.
00:33:19.957,00:33:21.207,"SpongeBob, look!"
00:33:21.291,00:33:22.793,Our car!
00:33:27.631,00:33:29.090,Where do you think it is?
00:33:51.321,00:33:53.281,"Now, how are we gonna get it?"
00:33:53.365,00:33:55.659,I know. Walk in and ask him for it.
00:33:59.245,00:34:01.373,"Patrick, that's a terrible idea."
00:34:01.456,00:34:02.749,Sorry.
00:34:02.833,00:34:03.834,I know.
00:34:03.917,00:34:06.920,"I'll go in and create a distraction, and you get the key."
00:34:07.004,00:34:08.005,Wait.
00:34:08.087,00:34:09.798,I wanna do the distraction.
00:34:09.882,00:34:11.299,Okay.
00:34:11.383,00:34:15.136,I guess it really doesn't matter who does the distraction.
00:34:24.021,00:34:27.024,Can I have everybody's attention?
00:34:33.321,00:34:35.156,I have to use the bathroom.
00:34:35.240,00:34:37.158,It's...
00:34:37.242,00:34:38.952,right over there.
00:34:39.953,00:34:42.247,Stupid contacts.
00:34:42.330,00:34:45.166,"Oh, there it is. I better go wash it off."
00:34:46.334,00:34:48.086,Patrick. You call that a distraction?
00:34:49.212,00:34:50.672,"Well, I had to go to the bathroom."
00:34:50.756,00:34:53.091,"Well, I got my hands dirty for nothing."
00:34:54.801,00:34:57.178,"Patrick, check it out."
00:34:58.764,00:35:00.432,-Hooray! -Hooray!
00:35:00.515,00:35:02.392,-Bubble party! -Bubble party!
00:35:20.786,00:35:22.913,Who blew this bubble?
00:35:25.791,00:35:27.250,You all know the rules!
00:35:30.963,00:35:35.174,by every able-bodied patron in the bar.
00:35:35.258,00:35:36.301,That's right!
00:35:36.384,00:35:37.552,So who blew it?
00:35:39.638,00:35:43.058,So...nobody knows.
00:35:43.141,00:35:45.060,-Maybe it was-- -Shut up!
00:35:45.143,00:35:48.521,Somebody in here ain't a real man.
00:35:48.605,00:35:50.816,You! We're on a baby hunt.
00:35:50.899,00:35:55.278,And don't think we don't know how to weed 'em out.
00:35:55.361,00:35:57.864,"Now, everybody line up!"
00:35:58.865,00:35:59.699,DJ!
00:35:59.783,00:36:02.995,Time for the test.
00:36:06.164,00:36:10.085,No baby can resist singing along to this.
00:36:10.168,00:36:13.922,"SpongeBob, it's the Goofy Goober Theme Song."
00:36:14.006,00:36:15.590,I know.
00:36:26.225,00:36:27.602,It was you! You're the baby!
00:36:27.686,00:36:30.563,"No, no! I only coughed, I swear."
00:36:31.439,00:36:32.524,DJ!
00:36:32.607,00:36:34.400,Turn it up louder!
00:36:36.653,00:36:39.656,"Don't sing along, Patrick."
00:36:39.739,00:36:41.950,I'm trying.
00:36:42.034,00:36:44.995,Trying so hard.
00:37:05.348,00:37:08.601,"Well, well, well."
00:37:08.685,00:37:10.645,Which one of you babies was it?
00:37:10.729,00:37:12.397,-It was him. -It was him.
00:37:12.480,00:37:13.773,-He did it. -He did it.
00:37:18.528,00:37:19.612,Well...
00:37:19.696,00:37:23.158,looks like we got ourselves a double baby.
00:37:27.704,00:37:29.664,"Man, that was a close call."
00:37:29.748,00:37:31.583,Guess what I got.
00:37:31.666,00:37:33.210,The key!
00:37:43.511,00:37:48.474,Too bad SpongeBob's not here to enjoy SpongeBob not being here.
00:37:57.650,00:37:58.860,Morning.
00:37:58.944,00:38:02.363,Some people have no taste in headgear.
00:38:06.325,00:38:08.161,Babies too?
00:38:09.204,00:38:14.751,"Excuse me, miss, but where is everybody getting that horrid headwear?"
00:38:14.834,00:38:16.253,Who said that?
00:38:16.335,00:38:17.336,Down here.
00:38:17.420,00:38:19.756,"Oh. Well, I got it at the Chum Bucket."
00:38:19.839,00:38:22.508,Plankton's giving them away free with every Krabby Patty.
00:38:22.592,00:38:24.010,Chum Bucket?
00:38:24.094,00:38:25.053,Free?
00:38:25.137,00:38:26.096,Krabby Patty?
00:38:26.179,00:38:27.513,Plankton?
00:38:27.597,00:38:28.890,Giving?
00:38:28.974,00:38:30.142,With?
00:38:33.228,00:38:34.312,So...
00:38:34.395,00:38:37.232,"You're selling Krabby Patties, Plankton?"
00:38:37.274,00:38:39.734,"That's right, Squidward."
00:38:39.818,00:38:43.404,And there's a free bucket helmet with every purchase.
00:38:43.488,00:38:44.906,Care for one?
00:38:44.990,00:38:46.407,No.
00:38:46.491,00:38:50.495,"You may have hoodwinked everyone else in this backwater town, but you can't fool me."
00:38:50.578,00:38:53.999,I listen to public radio.
00:38:54.082,00:38:55.416,And what's that supposed to mean?
00:38:55.500,00:38:57.627,It means you set up Mr. Krabs.
00:38:57.710,00:39:04.592,You stole the crown so Neptune would freeze him and you could finally get your stubby little paws on the Krabby Patty formula.
00:39:04.676,00:39:06.928,It was you all along.
00:39:07.012,00:39:09.973,But you made one fatal mistake.
00:39:10.056,00:39:12.475,You messed with my paycheck.
00:39:12.558,00:39:17.897,"And I'm gonna report you to the highest authority in the land, King Neptune!"
00:39:17.981,00:39:21.234,"We'll see about that, Inspector Looselips."
00:39:22.819,00:39:25.530,Now activating helmet brain-control devices.
00:39:25.780,00:39:35.748,CONTROL What?
00:39:47.426,00:39:48.386,What's going on here?
00:39:48.469,00:39:49.470,All hail Plankton.
00:39:49.554,00:39:51.639,"Seize him, slaves!"
00:39:55.393,00:39:57.145,I'm getting out of here!
00:39:58.437,00:40:01.649,All hail Plankton.
00:40:01.733,00:40:03.651,All hail Plankton.
00:40:06.738,00:40:08.907,Who can stop me now?
00:40:10.783,00:40:12.911,Who?
00:40:17.665,00:40:20.168,"Oh, gee. Come on, Pat, one more time."
00:40:20.252,00:40:21.378,Okay.
00:40:23.213,00:40:26.091,And don't think we don't know how to weed 'em out.
00:40:33.806,00:40:35.350,Weed them out.
00:40:36.976,00:40:38.603,What a jerk.
00:40:44.359,00:40:46.903,The road's getting kind of bumpy here.
00:40:47.779,00:40:51.908,"You know, SpongeBob, there's a lesson to be learned from all of this."
00:40:51.991,00:40:53.410,"What's that, Patrick?"
00:40:53.492,00:40:57.663,A bubble-blowing double baby doesn't belong out here...
00:40:57.747,00:40:59.540,in man's country.
00:40:59.624,00:41:01.542,Yeah. Wait.
00:41:01.626,00:41:03.002,We blew that bubble.
00:41:03.461,00:41:06.798,Doesn't that make us a bubble-blowing double baby?
00:41:07.799,00:41:09.717,"Hey, look, free ice cream!"
00:41:09.801,00:41:13.554,"FREE ICE CREAM Oh, boy!"
00:41:19.685,00:41:21.479,How ya doin'?
00:41:22.730,00:41:24.316,Wait a minute.
00:41:24.399,00:41:25.691,Wait a minute!
00:41:25.775,00:41:27.693,SpongeBob!
00:41:27.777,00:41:28.945,Yeah?
00:41:29.028,00:41:31.489,Make mine a chocolate!
00:41:31.572,00:41:33.699,"Got you covered. Two, please."
00:41:33.783,00:41:35.452,Certainly.
00:41:35.534,00:41:37.287,You kids enjoy.
00:41:37.370,00:41:40.081,"Actually, we're men, lady, but thanks."
00:41:40.165,00:41:41.958,"Okay, Patrick, let's..."
00:41:42.041,00:41:44.877,"You can let go now. I said, let go, please."
00:41:45.962,00:41:47.505,Yuck!
00:41:47.588,00:41:50.467,What is this?
00:41:55.013,00:41:57.974,What kind of old lady are you?
00:42:23.041,00:42:24.750,Did you get the ice cream?
00:42:27.045,00:42:29.255,"Step on it, Patrick!"
00:42:51.903,00:42:59.827,"You may not know it, cowboy, but we got a rule around here about blowing bubbles."
00:43:02.247,00:43:07.502,will be beaten senseless by-- every able-bodied...
00:43:08.753,00:43:09.879,in bar...
00:43:24.894,00:43:28.565,"Come on, kiddies, have some ice cream."
00:43:30.442,00:43:34.362,I'll let you pet Mr. Whiskers.
00:43:37.740,00:43:40.201,"Jump for it, Patrick!"
00:44:03.308,00:44:06.144,"Well, we lost our car again."
00:44:06.227,00:44:09.188,"Well, never mind the car, where's the road?"
00:44:12.233,00:44:14.735,Road. Road. Road.
00:44:14.819,00:44:17.696,Road. R-- Sorry.
00:44:17.780,00:44:18.823,There's the road.
00:44:18.906,00:44:21.534,On the other side of this...
00:44:21.618,00:44:24.621,deep... dark...
00:44:25.163,00:44:27.332,dangerous...
00:44:28.040,00:44:29.459,Hazardous.
00:44:29.542,00:44:30.585,hazardous...
00:44:31.752,00:44:33.129,Monster-infested.
00:44:33.212,00:44:35.590,"Yeah, monster-infested..."
00:44:36.841,00:44:37.758,trench.
00:44:37.842,00:44:39.218,"Hey, SpongeBob, look!"
00:44:39.302,00:44:42.054,Here's the way down.
00:44:45.558,00:44:48.269,"Well, we're not gonna get the crown standing here."
00:44:48.353,00:44:49.895,On to Shell City.
00:44:52.023,00:44:52.940,Hey?
00:44:58.779,00:45:00.865,"Hey, look, it's making noise."
00:45:00.948,00:45:02.492,SpongeBob?
00:45:04.327,00:45:05.995,"Hey, where are you going?"
00:45:06.078,00:45:07.413,"I'm going home, Patrick."
00:45:07.497,00:45:09.541,But what about Mr. Krabs?
00:45:09.624,00:45:10.625,What about us?
00:45:10.707,00:45:13.085,We'll never survive in that trench!
00:45:13.169,00:45:15.963,"You said it yourself, this is man's country."
00:45:16.047,00:45:19.551,"And let's face it, Pat. We're just..."
00:45:19.634,00:45:20.552,kids.
00:45:20.635,00:45:22.053,We're not kids.
00:45:22.136,00:45:24.138,"Open your eyes, Patrick!"
00:45:24.222,00:45:26.641,"We blow bubbles, we eat ice cream."
00:45:26.723,00:45:30.186,"We worship a dancing peanut, for corn's sake!"
00:45:30.269,00:45:32.313,We don't belong out here!
00:45:32.397,00:45:35.400,We do not worship him.
00:45:35.483,00:45:40.071,"Patrick, you've been wearing the same Goofy Goober Peanut Party underpants for three years straight."
00:45:40.154,00:45:42.073,What do you call that?
00:45:42.156,00:45:43.533,Worship?
00:45:43.616,00:45:47.453,"Oh, you're right, SpongeBob. We are kids!"
00:45:54.419,00:45:56.170,"Pull your pants up, Patrick."
00:45:56.254,00:45:57.463,We're going home.
00:46:00.466,00:46:01.342,Mindy!
00:46:01.426,00:46:02.677,Mindy?
00:46:05.137,00:46:06.514,How much did you hear?
00:46:06.598,00:46:07.432,I heard enough.
00:46:07.515,00:46:09.016,Did you see my underwear?
00:46:09.100,00:46:10.268,"No, Patrick."
00:46:10.351,00:46:11.436,Did you want to?
00:46:11.519,00:46:15.481,"Look, guys, you may be kids, but you're the only ones left who can get that crown."
00:46:15.565,00:46:17.483,"What do you mean, the only ones left?"
00:46:17.567,00:46:21.195,Things have gotten a lot worse since you left Bikini Bottom.
00:46:21.279,00:46:24.781,Or should I say Planktopolis.
00:46:27.868,00:46:29.078,No resting!
00:46:29.161,00:46:33.708,This monument celebrating my glory isn't gonna build itself.
00:46:33.790,00:46:35.251,Move faster!
00:46:35.334,00:46:37.670,"Oh, my gosh! Patrick, look!"
00:46:37.754,00:46:41.048,Plankton's turned everyone we know into slaves.
00:46:41.132,00:46:42.341,Squidward.
00:46:42.425,00:46:44.761,DO NOT FEED THE SQUIRREL Sandy.
00:46:44.843,00:46:46.137,Mrs. Puff.
00:46:47.305,00:46:48.723,Even Gary.
00:46:48.805,00:46:50.600,"Meow, Plankton."
00:46:50.683,00:46:52.893,Can't your father do something?
00:46:56.606,00:47:00.485,"HAIR IN A CAN Squire, will you hurry."
00:47:03.195,00:47:05.573,"So you see, you can't quit."
00:47:05.657,00:47:08.409,The fate of Bikini Bottom rests in your hands.
00:47:08.493,00:47:11.954,But-- But we're just-- Hey. It doesn't matter if you're kids.
00:47:12.037,00:47:14.915,"And what's so wrong with being a kid, anyway? Kids rule!"
00:47:14.999,00:47:17.585,You don't need to be a man to do this.
00:47:17.669,00:47:20.254,You just gotta believe in yourself.
00:47:20.338,00:47:23.633,You just gotta believe!
00:47:24.425,00:47:25.593,I believe.
00:47:25.677,00:47:26.885,That's the spirit.
00:47:26.969,00:47:31.932,I believe that everybody I know is a goner!
00:47:34.185,00:47:35.728,"Come on, guys."
00:47:37.938,00:47:39.273,Guys.
00:47:41.192,00:47:42.527,Guys?
00:48:02.254,00:48:03.673,Guys?
00:48:07.009,00:48:08.636,"Oh, boy."
00:48:09.846,00:48:11.263,"Think, Mindy, think."
00:48:13.391,00:48:15.727,"Yup, I guess you're right."
00:48:17.019,00:48:20.481,A couple of kids could never survive this journey.
00:48:22.899,00:48:27.572,That's why I guess I'll just have to turn you into men.
00:48:28.406,00:48:31.826,You can do that? How?
00:48:31.908,00:48:34.662,With my mermaid magic.
00:48:34.746,00:48:35.830,MERMAID MAGIC?
00:48:36.955,00:48:38.374,"Did you hear that, Patrick?"
00:48:38.457,00:48:41.627,She'll use her mermaid magic to turn us into men!
00:48:41.711,00:48:43.295,-Hooray! -Hooray!
00:48:45.005,00:48:46.131,We're gonna be men!
00:48:46.215,00:48:47.425,We're gonna be men!
00:48:47.508,00:48:49.385,"Good. Now, let's get started."
00:48:49.468,00:48:50.887,Close your eyes.
00:48:50.969,00:48:52.012,Are we men yet?
00:48:52.096,00:48:53.222,Not yet.
00:48:53.305,00:48:55.057,Spin around three times.
00:48:55.140,00:48:57.393,I think it's working.
00:48:57.476,00:49:00.521,"Good. Now, keep your eyes shut."
00:49:00.605,00:49:03.023,With my mermaid's magic...
00:49:04.316,00:49:06.026,And my one tailfin...
00:49:07.319,00:49:10.364,I command the two of you to turn into men!
00:49:10.448,00:49:12.324,Open your eyes.
00:49:14.911,00:49:20.249,"I don't feel any-- Oh, my gosh, Patrick, you have a mustache!"
00:49:20.332,00:49:21.626,So do you!
00:49:25.463,00:49:29.133,"So now that you're men, can you make it to Shell City?"
00:49:34.305,00:49:38.100,"I said, now that you're men, can you make it to Shell City?"
00:49:39.477,00:49:40.977,Are men afraid of anything?
00:49:46.275,00:49:47.151,Yeah!
00:49:48.193,00:49:50.780,I never said that.
00:49:50.863,00:49:51.948,-Yeah! -Yeah!
00:49:52.030,00:49:53.031,-Yeah! -Yeah!
00:49:53.115,00:49:54.450,-Yeah! -Yeah!
00:49:54.533,00:49:55.534,Yeah!
00:49:55.618,00:49:57.077,Yeah! Yeah!
00:49:57.161,00:49:58.245,Yeah!
00:49:58.329,00:49:59.789,Yeah.
00:49:59.872,00:50:01.916,Yeah.
00:50:03.584,00:50:06.044,"-Patrick? -Yeah, buddy?"
00:50:06.128,00:50:09.298,Why did we jump over the edge instead of taking the stairs?
00:50:09.381,00:50:12.677,Becau-- Well...
00:50:25.272,00:50:26.649,Patrick!
00:50:26.774,00:50:27.817,Are we dead?
00:50:27.900,00:50:30.110,"No. Far from it, my friend."
00:50:30.194,00:50:33.280,We're safe and sound at the bottom of this trench.
00:50:40.621,00:50:42.498,The mustaches worked!
00:50:42.581,00:50:44.458,Do you know what that means?
00:50:44.542,00:50:46.460,We are invincible!
00:51:40.138,00:51:42.016,"Yeah, go, Pat."
00:51:57.448,00:51:59.366,"Oh, yeah."
00:51:59.450,00:52:01.911,"Yeah, go, SpongeBob."
00:52:29.187,00:52:31.315,"Shell City, dead ahead."
00:52:31.398,00:52:32.566,"We did it, Pat!"
00:52:32.650,00:52:33.943,We made it past everything!
00:52:34.026,00:52:36.320,"Even the hideous, disgusting monsters."
00:52:37.989,00:52:40.950,Awww...
00:52:41.033,00:52:42.660,Not you guys.
00:52:42.743,00:52:44.078,You guys are awesome!
00:52:44.160,00:52:46.831,"Well, Patrick, we should be there in one more verse."
00:52:49.000,00:52:49.875,Finally.
00:52:51.836,00:52:54.755,I got you right where I want you.
00:52:55.673,00:52:57.633,"Can I help you with something, sir?"
00:52:57.716,00:52:59.426,Name's Dennis.
00:52:59.510,00:53:02.054,I've been hired to exterminate you.
00:53:02.138,00:53:06.851,You're gonna... exterminate us?
00:53:24.409,00:53:30.749,"Listen, junior, you caught me and my friend here in a good mood today, so I'm gonna let you off with a warning."
00:53:30.833,00:53:35.629,"Step aside, and you won't have to feel the awesome wrath of our mustaches."
00:53:35.713,00:53:38.214,You mean these?
00:53:40.968,00:53:46.140,I thought you still had a piece of salad stuck to your lip from lunchtime.
00:53:51.395,00:53:52.980,They were fake?
00:53:53.064,00:53:54.899,Of course they were fake!
00:53:54.982,00:53:58.819,This is what a real mustache looks like.
00:54:02.280,00:54:03.407,Is he a mermaid?
00:54:03.490,00:54:05.826,All right. Enough gab.
00:54:08.328,00:54:10.831,What are you gonna do to us?
00:54:10.915,00:54:13.333,Plankton was very specific.
00:54:13.417,00:54:14.585,Plankton?
00:54:14.668,00:54:17.504,"For some reason, he wanted me to step on you."
00:54:17.588,00:54:19.339,Step on us?
00:54:19.423,00:54:20.340,Yeah!
00:54:20.424,00:54:24.260,That way you'll never find out that he stole the crown!
00:54:25.679,00:54:28.473,Perhaps I've said too much.
00:54:35.564,00:54:37.233,That's a big boot.
00:54:37.315,00:54:38.442,Don't worry.
00:54:38.525,00:54:40.611,This will only hurt a lot.
00:54:44.823,00:54:46.366,I love this job!
00:54:48.786,00:54:50.079,Bigger boot!
00:54:50.162,00:54:51.080,"Wait, Pat."
00:54:51.163,00:54:53.874,This bigger boot saved our lives.
00:54:53.958,00:54:55.126,Yay!
00:55:02.382,00:55:04.676,Stranger?
00:55:06.302,00:55:08.222,It's the Cyclops!
00:55:36.708,00:55:39.170,"Save us, someone!"
00:56:04.695,00:56:06.197,Are we dead?
00:56:06.280,00:56:08.073,I don't think so.
00:56:08.573,00:56:11.952,Artificially colored rocks?
00:56:14.205,00:56:18.792,I don't know where we are-- What is this?
00:56:18.876,00:56:22.087,It's some kind of wall of psychic energy.
00:56:22.171,00:56:26.424,"No, Pat, it's a giant glass bowl."
00:56:26.508,00:56:28.802,"Hey, there's some fish folk."
00:56:29.553,00:56:30.470,Hey!
00:56:30.554,00:56:31.972,"-Over here! -Hey! Hey, you guys!"
00:56:32.056,00:56:34.683,"-You guys, hey! Help! -Hey! Help!"
00:56:34.766,00:56:35.893,A little help here!
00:56:35.976,00:56:40.522,-Help us out of the tank! -We're stuck in this-- Wait a second.
00:56:45.401,00:56:47.363,Those fish are...
00:56:47.445,00:56:48.322,...dead.
00:57:08.759,00:57:10.886,What's he gonna do with us?
00:57:16.183,00:57:20.938,"Oh, no, he's going for his evil instruments of torture."
00:57:24.400,00:57:42.542,GOOGLE EYES GLUE-ALL He's making a humorous diorama of...
00:57:45.045,00:57:48.048,Alexander Clam Bell?
00:57:48.132,00:57:52.552,"Patrick, he's killing sea animals and making them into smelly knickknacks."
00:57:52.636,00:57:54.512,And I think we're next.
00:57:54.596,00:57:55.931,You think so?
00:57:56.014,00:57:58.475,Patrick! No!
00:58:13.531,00:58:17.911,from this lamp that I can't... move.
00:58:17.995,00:58:19.704,Tell me about it.
00:58:34.011,00:58:45.272,"You mean we're not gonna I don't even think we're gonna be able to save ourselves, buddy."
00:58:48.900,00:58:50.068,Thanks.
00:58:50.152,00:58:51.695,Don't mention it.
00:58:51.778,00:58:56.950,"Well, it looks like what everybody said about us is true, Patrick."
00:58:57.034,00:58:58.952,You mean that we're attractive?
00:58:59.036,00:59:02.164,"No, that we're just kids."
00:59:02.247,00:59:06.126,A couple of kids in way over their heads.
00:59:06.210,00:59:08.837,We were doomed from the start.
00:59:08.920,00:59:10.381,"I mean, look at us."
00:59:10.464,00:59:13.633,We didn't even come close to the crown.
00:59:13.717,00:59:15.844,We let everybody down.
00:59:15.927,00:59:17.846,We failed.
00:59:17.929,00:59:19.431,Shell City.
00:59:19.515,00:59:22.934,"Yeah, we never made it to Shell City."
00:59:23.018,00:59:24.811,Shell City.
00:59:24.895,00:59:26.313,"Exactly, buddy."
00:59:26.397,00:59:30.484,"Yeah, the place we never got to."
00:59:30.526,00:59:33.611,"Okay, now you're starting to bum me out, Patrick."
00:59:33.695,00:59:35.822,"No, look at the sign."
00:59:35.906,00:59:40.994,Shell City. Marine gifts and sundries.
00:59:41.078,00:59:44.164,Shell City is a gift shop?
00:59:44.248,00:59:49.545,"But if this is Shell City, then where's the..."
00:59:50.754,00:59:52.339,-Crown. -Crown.
00:59:53.882,00:59:55.926,Neptune's crown.
00:59:56.009,00:59:59.137,This is Shell City.
00:59:59.221,01:00:03.267,"Pat, we did make it."
01:00:03.350,01:00:04.851,Yeah.
01:00:04.935,01:00:07.062,I guess we did.
01:00:08.355,01:00:12.025,We did all right for a couple of goofballs.
01:01:05.162,01:01:09.249,That's the end of SpongeBob.
01:01:09.333,01:01:11.502,"Come here, you."
01:01:12.919,01:01:16.089,Squawk! Shut up and look at the screen.
01:01:16.173,01:01:17.007,Squawk!
01:01:17.090,01:01:19.176,The bird's right. Look.
01:01:19.259,01:01:23.347,It be the tear of the Goofy Goobers.
01:01:55.212,01:01:57.506,"Hey, we're alive!"
01:02:03.679,01:02:05.138,Let's get that crown.
01:02:05.222,01:02:06.306,Right.
01:02:07.807,01:02:09.726,"On three, Patrick. Ready?"
01:02:09.809,01:02:11.144,"One, two, three."
01:02:11.228,01:02:13.313,"Hey, it's lighter than I thought."
01:02:20.404,01:02:32.832,SEAHORSES $2 What's happening?
01:02:32.916,01:02:36.294,I don't know. Look!
01:03:20.880,01:03:22.090,"Come on, Patrick."
01:03:23.634,01:03:26.803,Let's get this crown back to Bikini Bottom.
01:03:28.305,01:03:30.766,Do you still have that bag of winds?
01:03:30.848,01:03:31.891,I sure do.
01:03:34.978,01:03:37.397,Here you go.
01:03:38.231,01:03:39.357,What?
01:03:39.441,01:03:41.025,Nothing. Nothing.
01:03:41.109,01:03:42.902,"Okay, let's go over the instructions."
01:03:42.986,01:03:48.199,"Let's see, it says here, Step one: Point bag away from home."
01:03:48.283,01:03:50.910,Step two: Plant feet firmly on ground.
01:03:50.994,01:03:52.412,Right.
01:03:52.496,01:03:55.582,"Step three: Remove string from bag, releasing the winds."
01:03:55.666,01:03:57.501,Check.
01:03:57.584,01:03:59.503,"Well, that seems simple enough."
01:03:59.586,01:04:03.674,"Point bag away from home, feet firmly on ground, pull string, releasing the winds."
01:04:03.757,01:04:06.343,"All right, let's do it for real."
01:04:06.426,01:04:09.095,SpongeBob?
01:04:11.431,01:04:13.642,"-No, no, stop! -I was bad, I'm sorry!"
01:04:13.725,01:04:16.102,"-I'm sorry, I just thought... -Please, bag."
01:04:16.186,01:04:17.771,It was a mistake!
01:04:23.901,01:04:25.320,"Oh, no."
01:04:25.403,01:04:28.281,How will we ever get back to Bikini Bottom now?
01:04:39.042,01:04:40.168,Who are you?
01:04:40.251,01:04:42.170,I'm David Hasselhoff.
01:04:45.256,01:04:47.175,So where's your boat?
01:04:47.258,01:04:48.218,Boat?
01:04:54.057,01:04:55.433,"Go, Hasselhoff."
01:04:55.517,01:04:57.018,"Next stop, Bikini Bottom."
01:05:00.897,01:05:03.274,All hail Plankton.
01:05:03.358,01:05:07.320,"Well, Krabs, you know what today is?"
01:05:07.404,01:05:09.239,"Sorry about this, calendar."
01:05:09.322,01:05:11.074,March 14th.
01:05:11.157,01:05:12.826,"Wait, that's not right."
01:05:12.909,01:05:16.872,It should say The day that Krabs fries.
01:05:23.754,01:05:25.505,Guess who's here.
01:05:37.517,01:05:41.396,Hooray for Hasselhoff! Nothing can stop us now.
01:05:41.479,01:05:46.276,Unidentified object off the hindquarters.
01:05:47.778,01:05:49.446,It looks like...
01:05:50.781,01:05:52.031,...bigger boot.
01:05:52.115,01:05:53.658,But how?
01:06:03.251,01:06:04.711,Dennis!
01:06:04.795,01:06:06.630,Did you miss me?
01:06:10.801,01:06:13.470,This is the best seat in the house.
01:06:13.553,01:06:18.182,"All right, Neptune, let's get it on!"
01:06:18.266,01:06:25.565,"Eugene Krabs, your six-day reprieve is up, and it is time for you to die."
01:06:29.319,01:06:31.905,There is nothing else I can do.
01:06:31.988,01:06:34.574,You can give SpongeBob and Patrick a little more time.
01:06:34.658,01:06:40.163,Except give SpongeBob and Patrick a little more ti-- What?
01:06:40.246,01:06:41.915,"Mindy, will you butt out."
01:06:41.998,01:06:45.168,I won't have you stalling this execution.
01:06:45.251,01:06:48.045,Stalling? I'm not stalling anything.
01:06:48.129,01:06:49.297,"Yes, you are."
01:06:49.380,01:06:50.423,"No, I'm not."
01:06:50.507,01:06:53.384,"Yes, you are. You're doing it right now."
01:06:53.468,01:06:56.763,-I'm stalling? -Yes.
01:06:56.847,01:06:57.764,Stalling?
01:06:57.848,01:06:58.765,Stalling!
01:07:01.893,01:07:03.436,"Oh, boy."
01:07:06.564,01:07:08.984,"Now, where were we?"
01:07:09.066,01:07:10.318,"Patrick, run."
01:07:10.401,01:07:11.444,No.
01:07:11.528,01:07:12.863,I'm tired of running.
01:07:12.946,01:07:19.995,"If we run now, we'll never stop-- Run, SpongeBob!"
01:07:26.626,01:07:28.586,"Take it easy back there, fellas."
01:07:36.720,01:07:38.680,"SpongeBob, be careful!"
01:07:38.763,01:07:41.683,"Come on, kid, give it up."
01:07:41.766,01:07:43.810,Dennis always gets his man.
01:07:43.894,01:07:46.021,Never!
01:07:53.904,01:07:55.488,Yeah! I did it!
01:07:55.572,01:07:57.407,"You got guts, kid."
01:07:57.490,01:07:59.409,Too bad I gotta rip 'em out of you.
01:07:59.492,01:08:04.539,"I don't know what Plankton's paying you, but if you let us go, I can make it worth your while."
01:08:04.622,01:08:07.166,It's gonna take a lot more than five...
01:08:07.250,01:08:08.292,What is this?
01:08:08.376,01:08:10.837,"That, sir, is five Goober dollars."
01:08:10.921,01:08:15.341,Legal tender at any participating Goofy Goober-- I got bubbles.
01:08:15.425,01:08:17.468,Fun at parties.
01:08:17.552,01:08:18.511,My eyes.
01:08:19.721,01:08:21.848,"I got you, SpongeBob."
01:08:21.932,01:08:23.516,"Thanks, buddy."
01:08:23.600,01:08:25.142,Thanks a lot.
01:08:25.226,01:08:26.770,That's it!
01:08:26.853,01:08:28.939,I'm through messing around!
01:08:29.022,01:08:30.565,"See you later, fools!"
01:08:38.531,01:08:40.575,See ya.
01:08:41.117,01:08:43.536,So you think...
01:08:43.620,01:08:45.038,I'm...
01:08:46.330,01:08:47.665,...stalling.
01:08:48.708,01:08:50.209,"Where am I, in Crazytown?"
01:08:50.293,01:08:54.005,I have had enough of this nonsense!
01:08:55.298,01:08:59.886,You are to wait in the carriage until the execution is done.
01:09:01.972,01:09:04.975,"But, Daddy-- Now!"
01:09:07.727,01:09:09.186,"No, no, no!"
01:09:09.270,01:09:12.315,"Oh, SpongeBob, wherever you are, you better hurry."
01:09:14.484,01:09:17.236,"Okay, fellas, this is where you get off."
01:09:17.320,01:09:18.989,Bikini Bottom's directly below.
01:09:19.072,01:09:21.616,But we'll never be able to float down in time.
01:09:21.699,01:09:24.243,Who said anything about...floating?
01:09:30.458,01:09:32.085,Did you see that?
01:09:32.168,01:09:33.252,The control.
01:09:35.338,01:09:38.008,All hands on deck.
01:09:39.342,01:09:40.927,Ten seconds to liftoff.
01:09:41.011,01:09:42.595,"Nine, eight..."
01:09:42.679,01:09:46.933,"Eugene Krabs, the time has come..."
01:09:47.017,01:09:48.476,-No. -Yes.
01:09:50.687,01:09:51.855,...for you...
01:09:51.938,01:09:53.606,-No. -Yes.
01:09:53.690,01:09:55.441,"...three, two..."
01:09:55.525,01:09:57.276,-to fry. -No.
01:09:57.360,01:09:58.361,Yes.
01:09:58.444,01:09:59.696,...one.
01:10:04.200,01:10:05.576,No!
01:10:08.496,01:10:10.874,"Ya done good, Hasselhoff."
01:10:10.957,01:10:19.132,Ya done-- Hooray! We made it!
01:10:19.215,01:10:20.466,We made it!
01:10:26.430,01:10:27.974,My crown.
01:10:29.100,01:10:32.729,My beautiful crown!
01:10:34.564,01:10:38.818,SpongeBob? Patrick? I knew you could do it.
01:10:47.410,01:10:51.789,"Oh, yes. Well done, SpongeBoob."
01:10:51.873,01:10:55.251,"Sorry to rain on your parade, Plankton."
01:10:55.334,01:10:57.420,"Oh, don't worry about me."
01:10:57.503,01:11:03.509,My parade shall be quite dry under my umbrella!
01:11:07.304,01:11:12.769,"KiNG SiZE Daddy, no."
01:11:12.852,01:11:14.854,"Daddy, yes!"
01:11:24.321,01:11:26.532,All hail Plankton.
01:11:26.616,01:11:29.368,All hail Plankton.
01:11:29.452,01:11:33.497,All hail Plankton.
01:11:33.581,01:11:36.834,All hail Plankton.
01:11:36.918,01:11:39.045,"SpongeBob, what happened?"
01:11:39.129,01:11:40.379,Plankton cheated.
01:11:40.463,01:11:41.464,Cheated?
01:11:41.547,01:11:43.549,"Hold on there, baldy."
01:11:43.633,01:11:45.051,"Oh, grow up."
01:11:45.135,01:11:48.263,"What, you think this is a game of kickball on the playground?"
01:11:48.345,01:11:51.766,"You never had a chance to defeat me, fool."
01:11:51.849,01:11:53.392,And you know why?
01:11:53.476,01:11:55.394,Because you cheated?
01:11:55.478,01:11:59.023,"No, not because I cheated, because I'm an evil genius."
01:11:59.107,01:12:01.525,And you're just a-- A kid.
01:12:02.568,01:12:04.070,A stupid kid.
01:12:08.992,01:12:11.452,"I guess you're right, Plankton."
01:12:11.535,01:12:12.870,I am just a kid.
01:12:12.954,01:12:15.456,"Of course I'm right. Okay, Neptune, time to kill."
01:12:15.539,01:12:21.420,"And you know, I've been through a lot in the past six days, five minutes, 27-and-a-half seconds."
01:12:21.504,01:12:27.093,"And if I've learned anything during that time, it's that you are who you are."
01:12:27.177,01:12:31.764,"That's right. Okay, Neptune-- And no amount of mermaid magic..."
01:12:32.807,01:12:35.268,...or managerial promotion...
01:12:36.644,01:12:43.484,...or some other third thing can make me anything more than what I really am inside: A kid.
01:12:43.567,01:12:45.111,"That's great. Now, get back against the wall."
01:12:46.445,01:12:47.738,What? What's going on?
01:12:47.822,01:12:50.616,Because I did what everyone said a kid couldn't do.
01:12:50.700,01:12:59.042,"I made it to Shell City, and I beat the Cyclops, and I rode the Hasselhoff, and I brought the crown back!"
01:12:59.125,01:13:00.584,"All right, we get the point."
01:13:00.668,01:13:02.128,"So, yeah, I'm a kid."
01:13:02.212,01:13:04.672,And I'm also a goofball. And a wing nut.
01:13:04.755,01:13:06.841,And a Knucklehead McSpazatron! What?
01:13:07.967,01:13:08.926,What's going on here?
01:13:09.010,01:13:10.761,"But most of all, I'm..."
01:13:10.845,01:13:12.305,"-Okay, settle down. -I'm..."
01:13:12.388,01:13:13.514,-Take it easy. -I'm...
01:13:13.597,01:13:14.807,What the scallop?
01:14:09.028,01:14:10.280,What's happening?
01:14:13.532,01:14:15.868,His dance moves are impressive.
01:14:15.952,01:14:17.620,But I'm in control!
01:14:17.703,01:14:18.955,Seize him!
01:14:20.706,01:14:22.375,Yeah!
01:14:22.458,01:14:24.001,All hail Plankton.
01:14:48.985,01:14:51.404,I'm free. I've been freed!
01:14:51.487,01:14:52.822,What?
01:14:54.157,01:14:55.950,No!
01:14:58.786,01:15:00.204,Yay!
01:15:07.795,01:15:09.464,My precious helmets!
01:15:13.426,01:15:14.593,Meow.
01:15:22.559,01:15:26.814,The helmets can't handle this level of rock 'n' roll.
01:15:26.897,01:15:29.150,"Karen, do something."
01:15:29.733,01:15:31.861,Karen?
01:15:34.780,01:15:36.991,"All right, that's the last straw."
01:15:37.074,01:15:40.203,"Neptune, I command you to..."
01:15:41.704,01:15:42.746,"Here you go, Daddy."
01:15:42.830,01:15:45.958,I... better get outta here.
01:15:46.042,01:15:48.461,"Look, it's the wizard who saved us."
01:15:48.544,01:15:50.463,"Out of my way, fools."
01:16:02.725,01:16:05.978,"Come on, I was just kidding."
01:16:06.812,01:16:09.565,"Come on, you guys knew that, didn't you?"
01:16:09.773,01:16:12.151,With the helmets and the big monuments...
01:16:12.235,01:16:16.489,"INSTITUTION FOR THE CRIMINALLY TINY Wasn't that hilarious, everybody?"
01:16:16.572,01:16:19.033,I will destroy all of you!
01:16:19.116,01:16:23.037,"Well, Mindy, I have to admit, you were right."
01:16:23.120,01:16:26.874,Your compassion for these sea creatures proved a most admirable trait.
01:16:26.957,01:16:32.088,"Without it, I would have never again seen my beloved crown."
01:16:32.171,01:16:36.008,I think you're going to make a fine ruler of the sea one day.
01:16:36.092,01:16:37.510,"Now, let's go home."
01:16:37.593,01:16:40.012,"Daddy, haven't you forgotten something?"
01:16:40.096,01:16:42.515,"Oh, yeah."
01:16:43.391,01:16:47.603,"Eugene Krabs, I forgot to unfreeze you."
01:16:50.440,01:16:51.690,What the--?
01:16:51.774,01:16:56.653,Oops. I guess I had it set to real boy ending.
01:16:57.780,01:16:59.156,Yipee!
01:16:59.240,01:17:03.202,"Oh, I'm sorry for falsely freezing you, Krabs."
01:17:03.286,01:17:13.296,"And may I say, sir, you are a very lucky fellow to have in your employ such a brave, faithful and heroic young lad."
01:17:13.754,01:17:14.964,"Where is he, anyway?"
01:17:15.465,01:17:17.300,I'm up here.
01:17:21.554,01:17:23.473,I'm on it.
01:17:26.850,01:17:29.437,"Go to him now, Krabs. Embrace him."
01:17:30.187,01:17:33.983,"SpongeBob, me boy, I'm sorry I ever doubted you."
01:17:34.066,01:17:36.110,That's a mistake I won't make again.
01:17:36.193,01:17:39.447,"Oh, Mr. Krabs, you old soft-serve."
01:17:39.530,01:17:45.453,"And now, SpongeBob, I'm gonna do something that I should've done six days ago."
01:17:45.536,01:17:48.914,"Mr. Squidward, front and center, please."
01:17:48.998,01:17:54.003,I think we all know who rightfully deserves to wear that manager pin.
01:17:54.086,01:17:56.547,"I couldn't agree more, sir."
01:17:56.631,01:17:58.174,Hooray for SpongeBob!
01:18:02.512,01:18:04.221,"Wait a second, everybody."
01:18:04.305,01:18:06.807,There's something I need to say first.
01:18:06.890,01:18:08.767,I just don't know how to put it.
01:18:08.851,01:18:11.020,I think I know what it is.
01:18:11.103,01:18:18.777,"After going on your life-changing journey, you now realize you don't want what you thought you wanted."
01:18:18.861,01:18:24.950,What you really wanted was inside you all along.
01:18:25.034,01:18:26.285,Are you crazy?
01:18:26.369,01:18:28.204,I was just gonna tell you that your fly is down.
01:18:28.287,01:18:32.291,Manager! This is the greatest day of my life!
