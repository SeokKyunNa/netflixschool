00:03:43.583,00:03:45.250,ANNOUNCER: The next stop is Broad Street.
00:03:45.416,00:03:47.250,Broad Street will be next.
00:04:58.500,00:05:00.041,Upstairs. This way.
00:05:09.250,00:05:10.708,He didn't come up this way? Huh?
00:05:10.875,00:05:12.625,He's not up here.
00:05:15.041,00:05:16.458,Excuse me.
00:05:35.541,00:05:38.041,Go ahead and park around the corner.
00:08:50.375,00:08:51.708,Visitors.
00:08:52.583,00:08:54.125,Do you mind if I fetch my teeth?
00:08:54.291,00:08:56.583,"Colonel, would you turn around, please?"
00:08:59.541,00:09:01.750,Sit down on the bed.
00:09:10.250,00:09:13.250,"Uh, they're in the..."
00:09:13.416,00:09:15.125,Look at me.
00:09:13.416,00:09:17.250,We are agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
00:09:17.416,00:09:18.416,Look at me!
00:09:18.583,00:09:20.083,I'm talking to you.
00:09:20.250,00:09:24.083,We've received information concerning your involvement in espionage.
00:09:24.250,00:09:27.458,"You can either cooperate with us right now, or you'll be under arrest."
00:09:27.625,00:09:28.833,"Do you understand, Colonel?"
00:09:29.000,00:09:30.583,"No, not really."
00:09:30.750,00:09:33.333,Why... Why do you keep calling me Colonel?
00:09:34.166,00:09:35.791,BLASCO: You need to get dressed.
00:09:35.958,00:09:37.791,We have to search your apartment.
00:09:37.958,00:09:41.958,"Would you mind if I, uh, cleaned my palette?"
00:09:42.125,00:09:44.750,"The paints, it'll get ruined otherwise."
00:09:44.916,00:09:47.041,It's just behind you there.
00:09:48.333,00:09:50.458,I have a cloth myself.
00:09:50.583,00:09:51.625,Thank you.
00:09:51.791,00:09:53.083,Start searching the place.
00:09:53.166,00:09:54.208,Thank you.
00:09:54.291,00:09:56.583,"All right, search the mattress, the bed, the floorboards, his chair."
00:09:56.750,00:09:58.625,Would you put that in the ashtray...
00:09:58.791,00:10:01.541,on the windowsill there?
00:10:04.291,00:10:05.708,GAMBER: Let's see the desk.
00:10:12.541,00:10:14.375,Wouldn't want to get this ruined.
00:10:28.458,00:10:30.625,DONOVAN: Don't say my guy.
00:10:30.791,00:10:32.541,He's not my guy.
00:10:33.625,00:10:36.583,"BATES: Yes, he's your guy."
00:10:36.750,00:10:40.750,We're talking about a guy who was insured by my client.
00:10:40.916,00:10:42.916,"So, don't make him my guy."
00:10:43.875,00:10:45.416,"BATES: Okay, fine."
00:10:45.583,00:10:48.750,"My point is, The guy insured by your client..."
00:10:48.916,00:10:51.666,he doesn't deny that any of these things happened.
00:10:51.833,00:10:54.375,These... These things?
00:10:54.541,00:10:56.750,"Yes, these five things."
00:10:56.916,00:10:58.583,"Wait, hold it, hold it, hold it."
00:10:58.750,00:11:00.208,Not five things.
00:11:00.375,00:11:01.916,One thing.
00:11:02.125,00:11:03.458,"Clearly, it's five things."
00:11:03.625,00:11:05.041,"Well, I'm sorry, it's not clear to me."
00:11:05.208,00:11:07.583,Five things?
00:11:07.750,00:11:09.083,It's self-evident.
00:11:09.250,00:11:10.916,"Okay, then tell me what happened."
00:11:11.083,00:11:14.541,Tell me the story in a way that makes sense for five things.
00:11:14.708,00:11:16.708,"Fine, absolutely."
00:11:16.875,00:11:18.416,Not my guy.
00:11:18.583,00:11:21.416,The guy insured by your client is driving down State Highway 19...
00:11:21.583,00:11:23.833,when he loses control of his car and hits my five guys...
00:11:24.000,00:11:26.000,the five guys who hired me to represent them...
00:11:26.125,00:11:27.708,because you're not honoring your claim.
00:11:27.875,00:11:31.250,"You mean my client is not honoring the claim, the insurance company?"
00:11:31.416,00:11:34.041,"we're all clear on who's who, here."
00:11:34.208,00:11:36.458,Except my client honors every claim.
00:11:36.958,00:11:38.250,"They do, Mr. Bates."
00:11:38.375,00:11:41.125,"Every single legitimate claim, up to the limit of their liability..."
00:11:41.291,00:11:45.458,"which is $100,000 per accident, in the case of this man's policy."
00:11:45.625,00:11:47.000,And this is one claim.
00:11:47.166,00:11:50.416,"According to your description, He hit my five guys."
00:11:50.583,00:11:53.416,The guy insured by my client had one accident.
00:11:53.500,00:11:54.583,"One, one, one."
00:11:54.666,00:11:58.000,Losing control of the car and hitting five motorcyclists.
00:11:58.166,00:12:00.958,"From their point of view, five things happened."
00:12:01.750,00:12:04.666,"Well, look, Bob."
00:12:05.458,00:12:06.500,Jim.
00:12:07.416,00:12:10.250,"If I go bowling and I throw a strike, one thing happened."
00:12:10.416,00:12:11.458,10 things didn't happen.
00:12:11.625,00:12:13.166,"Jim, my guys aren't bowling pins..."
00:12:13.416,00:12:15.125,as much as your guy may have treated them as such.
00:12:15.291,00:12:16.958,If... Let me finish.
00:12:17.125,00:12:21.500,"If your house is insured for $100,000 and a tornado carries it away..."
00:12:21.583,00:12:23.000,it carried away one house.
00:12:23.166,00:12:24.750,It didn't pick up every stick of furniture...
00:12:24.875,00:12:27.208,and destroy it in a separate incident.
00:12:27.375,00:12:29.375,If that is what you're saying...
00:12:29.958,00:12:33.250,"well, then there is never any limit to our liability..."
00:12:33.416,00:12:36.291,and that is the end of the insurance business.
00:12:36.458,00:12:39.083,"And then, Bob, nobody is safe."
00:12:44.083,00:12:46.458,"Watters, Cowan and Donovan."
00:12:46.625,00:12:47.833,"Morning, Mr. Donovan."
00:12:48.000,00:12:49.250,"Good morning, Alison."
00:12:49.416,00:12:51.416,I moved your 9 a.m.
00:12:51.583,00:12:52.708,Why did you do that?
00:12:52.875,00:12:54.333,I asked her to.
00:12:54.958,00:12:56.250,"Is everything all right, Tom?"
00:12:56.416,00:12:59.291,Why don't you leave your stuff with Alison.
00:13:00.166,00:13:03.291,Something pretty important has come up.
00:13:03.458,00:13:04.958,Natalie's getting your coffee.
00:13:05.125,00:13:07.666,"Nescafe, cream, two lumps, right?"
00:13:07.833,00:13:09.375,That's right. Thanks.
00:13:11.458,00:13:12.583,Lynn!
00:13:12.750,00:13:14.458,Nice to see you again.
00:13:14.625,00:13:16.041,"Great, good."
00:13:16.208,00:13:18.375,Homicidal.
00:13:18.541,00:13:21.833,"If she acts on it, she'll have good representation."
00:13:22.000,00:13:23.250,"Now, what's up?"
00:13:29.750,00:13:31.541,"Okay, here's the thing."
00:13:31.708,00:13:34.875,"The Soviet spy they caught, we want you to defend him."
00:13:35.041,00:13:36.750,Here's the indictment.
00:13:39.916,00:13:41.083,Wow.
00:13:42.541,00:13:44.375,I'm not sure I wanna pick that up.
00:13:44.541,00:13:46.333,The accused doesn't know any lawyers.
00:13:46.500,00:13:49.000,The federal court tossed it into our lap.
00:13:49.750,00:13:51.583,The Bar Committee took a vote.
00:13:51.750,00:13:53.375,You're the unanimous choice.
00:13:53.541,00:13:54.875,It was important to us...
00:13:55.041,00:13:56.458,"It's important to our country, Jim..."
00:13:56.625,00:13:58.458,that this man is seen as getting a fair shake.
00:13:58.625,00:14:00.375,American justice will be on trial.
00:14:00.541,00:14:04.250,"Of course, when you put it that way, it's an honor to be asked."
00:14:04.416,00:14:06.208,"But, Lynn, I'm an insurance lawyer."
00:14:06.291,00:14:08.083,I haven't done criminal work in years.
00:14:08.250,00:14:09.958,"riding a bike, isn't it?"
00:14:10.125,00:14:12.291,You distinguished yourself at Nuremberg.
00:14:12.458,00:14:14.083,I was on the prosecution team.
00:14:14.166,00:14:15.166,Not the point.
00:14:15.250,00:14:16.875,You're no stranger to criminal law.
00:14:17.583,00:14:19.250,"Jim, look at the situation."
00:14:19.416,00:14:21.458,The man is publicly reviled.
00:14:21.625,00:14:22.875,"And I will be, too."
00:14:23.041,00:14:24.458,"Yes, in more ignorant quarters."
00:14:24.625,00:14:28.125,"But that's exactly why this has to be done, and capably done."
00:14:28.291,00:14:31.916,It can't look like our justice system tosses people on the ash heap.
00:14:36.916,00:14:39.458,"Suppose I did, what's the evidence look like?"
00:14:40.791,00:14:42.250,Pretty overwhelming.
00:14:42.791,00:14:44.666,Great. Great.
00:14:44.833,00:14:47.333,Everyone will hate me but at least I'll lose.
00:14:49.583,00:14:51.250,"What do you think, Tom?"
00:14:51.416,00:14:53.958,The firm will suffer.
00:14:54.125,00:14:56.250,I think it's a patriotic duty.
00:14:56.416,00:14:58.000,It's an important mission.
00:14:58.166,00:15:00.583,"I told Lynn, the firm can't say no..."
00:15:00.750,00:15:03.458,"and you'd have a tough time saying no, too."
00:15:04.125,00:15:07.000,I think you have to defend the son of a bitch.
00:15:07.208,00:15:08.875,"So, you're doing it?"
00:15:09.041,00:15:10.208,DONOVAN: Doing what?
00:15:10.708,00:15:13.583,"Defending Abel, the Soviet spy."
00:15:13.750,00:15:15.125,I may.
00:15:15.291,00:15:17.583,"Wait, how do you know?"
00:15:17.750,00:15:19.708,"No, I was talking to Richard Earl..."
00:15:19.875,00:15:22.083,"Look, if I do this, I'm going to need your help."
00:15:25.000,00:15:26.708,Can you work tonight?
00:15:28.125,00:15:30.083,"I have a dinner date, sir."
00:15:33.291,00:15:35.458,"It's Tuesday, right?"
00:15:35.583,00:15:37.083,"Thank you, sir."
00:15:40.750,00:15:42.333,DONOVAN: But it's also an honor.
00:15:42.500,00:15:44.666,And the Bar Association asked me...
00:15:44.833,00:15:48.041,because they want to show that even a spy gets a capable advocate.
00:15:48.208,00:15:50.208,Maybe it's the kind of honor we could do without.
00:15:50.291,00:15:52.083,"Hey, honey, what are you doing home?"
00:15:53.000,00:15:54.208,I got stood up.
00:15:55.083,00:15:57.708,"Well, that's despicable."
00:15:57.875,00:15:59.208,Who is this knot-head?
00:15:59.375,00:16:00.625,I'd rather not say.
00:16:00.791,00:16:02.666,"Well, sit down."
00:16:02.833,00:16:03.833,People are scared.
00:16:03.916,00:16:08.000,They're building bomb shelters to protect themselves from people like this man.
00:16:08.166,00:16:09.416,I go to the store...
00:16:09.583,00:16:12.666,people are buying canned food and potassium tablets.
00:16:12.833,00:16:15.541,It's all about this man and what he represents.
00:16:15.708,00:16:17.583,He's a threat to all of us.
00:16:17.750,00:16:19.500,ROGER: Who's a traitor?
00:16:19.583,00:16:20.583,Who were they?
00:16:20.708,00:16:22.416,They gave atomic secrets to the Russians.
00:16:22.583,00:16:24.416,They were Americans.
00:16:24.583,00:16:26.750,You can't accuse Abel of being a traitor.
00:16:26.916,00:16:27.916,He's not an American.
00:16:28.041,00:16:29.583,"Oh, listen to yourself."
00:16:29.750,00:16:31.166,You're defending him already.
00:16:31.375,00:16:34.083,You're rehearsing it on me.
00:16:34.250,00:16:36.916,"I am just thinking about it, just very hard."
00:16:37.083,00:16:40.000,Everyone deserves a defense.
00:16:40.166,00:16:41.583,"Jim, what do we deserve?"
00:16:41.750,00:16:43.500,Do you know how people will look at us?
00:16:43.583,00:16:45.916,The family of a man trying to free a traitor?
00:16:46.041,00:16:47.541,"DONOVAN: He's not a traitor, Mary."
00:16:47.625,00:16:49.000,"Roger, get that!"
00:16:49.083,00:16:50.333,Why do I have to do all the work?
00:16:50.416,00:16:52.125,"Oh, wait till we say grace."
00:16:52.250,00:16:53.833,He's about the most unpopular man in this country...
00:16:53.916,00:16:55.291,and you're trying to take second place!
00:16:55.458,00:16:56.916,"Yeah, and I'm third."
00:16:57.083,00:16:58.875,"DONOVAN: Carol, you just dated the wrong guy."
00:16:59.041,00:17:01.333,"Mary, don't make this an argument when we're not having an argument."
00:17:01.416,00:17:02.708,"You're against him, I'm for him?"
00:17:02.875,00:17:05.416,"No, I'm not for him."
00:17:05.583,00:17:08.291,I'm for his right to have a defense in a court of law...
00:17:08.458,00:17:10.583,which is why they call it a court of law.
00:17:10.750,00:17:12.416,I didn't mean to interrupt dinner.
00:17:12.583,00:17:13.750,"Hey, Doug."
00:17:13.916,00:17:18.291,"Oh, no, not at all."
00:17:18.458,00:17:20.625,I'm not flailing.
00:17:20.791,00:17:22.583,We're having meatloaf tonight.
00:17:24.958,00:17:28.583,"So, you came over to help Jim think about whether he's taking the case?"
00:17:28.750,00:17:31.833,"Oh, we're taking it!"
00:17:39.666,00:17:42.416,"Lord, we thank thee for thy blessings we are about to receive."
00:17:42.916,00:17:45.500,"Thy bounty through Christ, our Lord. Amen."
00:17:52.958,00:17:54.958,"Good morning, sir."
00:17:55.125,00:17:56.958,These are my credentials.
00:17:57.125,00:17:59.250,"I am a partner in Watters, Cowan and Donovan."
00:17:59.375,00:18:02.833,I was admitted to the New York Bar in 1941.
00:18:06.750,00:18:10.458,You have been charged with 3 counts and 19 overt acts.
00:18:10.625,00:18:15.000,Conspiracy to transmit United States defense and atomic secrets to the Soviet Union...
00:18:15.083,00:18:16.750,conspiracy to gather secrets...
00:18:16.916,00:18:19.500,and failing to register as a foreign agent.
00:18:24.750,00:18:27.458,Do many foreign agents register?
00:18:32.083,00:18:34.750,"If you don't mind my asking, sir..."
00:18:35.291,00:18:39.250,"since your arrest, where have you been?"
00:18:42.208,00:18:44.583,I couldn't say for certain.
00:18:46.083,00:18:47.791,You don't know?
00:18:48.750,00:18:53.208,"They drove me to an airport and put me on a plane, took me off the plane."
00:18:54.958,00:18:56.791,Somewhere hot.
00:18:57.666,00:18:58.625,It's hot here.
00:18:58.750,00:19:00.916,Hot and very humid.
00:19:01.750,00:19:04.250,They put me in a room.
00:19:05.583,00:19:06.958,Were you beaten?
00:19:07.750,00:19:08.833,No.
00:19:09.000,00:19:10.791,I was talked to.
00:19:10.958,00:19:13.000,Offers were made.
00:19:13.166,00:19:14.166,What do you mean?
00:19:14.250,00:19:18.083,"Offers of employment, to work for your government."
00:19:19.958,00:19:22.250,I was told if I cooperated...
00:19:22.416,00:19:25.916,no further charges would be made against me.
00:19:26.083,00:19:28.750,And I would be given money.
00:19:29.000,00:19:31.833,Hmm. And you declined?
00:19:33.208,00:19:34.500,As you see.
00:19:35.291,00:19:37.750,"Well, of course I can't endorse that."
00:19:37.916,00:19:41.958,I feel duty-bound to urge you to cooperate with the U.S. government.
00:19:42.125,00:19:43.333,"Well, I said no."
00:19:43.500,00:19:46.625,Perhaps you could relay to your friends at the CIA that I meant it.
00:19:46.791,00:19:48.208,"No, no, no."
00:19:48.875,00:19:51.208,I don't work for the agency.
00:19:52.375,00:19:54.333,I don't work for the government.
00:19:54.500,00:19:57.833,I am here to offer my services as your legal counsel.
00:19:58.000,00:20:00.833,If you accept them as such...
00:20:02.083,00:20:03.458,I work for you.
00:20:04.416,00:20:06.166,If I accept you?
00:20:12.666,00:20:14.750,Are you good at what you do?
00:20:16.083,00:20:18.791,Yeah. I'm pretty good.
00:20:21.250,00:20:25.083,Have you represented many accused spies?
00:20:27.666,00:20:29.416,"No, not yet."
00:20:31.041,00:20:33.666,This will be a first for the both of us.
00:20:37.458,00:20:38.500,Yes.
00:20:40.916,00:20:42.083,All right.
00:20:42.458,00:20:44.625,All right? You accept?
00:20:46.750,00:20:48.250,"Yes, all right."
00:20:48.416,00:20:49.916,"Good, okay."
00:20:50.750,00:20:51.750,Let's start here.
00:20:51.833,00:20:54.250,If you are firm in your resolve not to cooperate with the U.S. government...
00:20:54.375,00:20:55.500,I am.
00:20:55.666,00:20:56.666,Yeah.
00:20:56.833,00:21:00.333,"Then do not talk to anybody else about your case, inside of government or out."
00:21:00.500,00:21:03.208,"Except to me, to the extent that you trust me."
00:21:03.708,00:21:05.625,I have a mandate to serve you.
00:21:05.750,00:21:09.166,"Quite frankly, everybody else has an interest in sending you to the electric chair."
00:21:09.875,00:21:11.041,All right.
00:21:14.416,00:21:16.333,You don't seem alarmed.
00:21:21.250,00:21:22.583,Would it help?
00:21:33.041,00:21:36.333,I... I would like materials to draw with.
00:21:37.208,00:21:38.916,That's not possible.
00:21:39.583,00:21:41.416,"A pencil, a piece of paper."
00:21:41.583,00:21:43.250,Cigarettes.
00:21:45.416,00:21:46.583,Please?
00:21:54.333,00:21:57.083,"Mr. Donovan, you have men like me..."
00:21:57.250,00:21:59.750,doing the same for your country.
00:22:00.750,00:22:02.833,If they were caught...
00:22:03.000,00:22:06.958,I'm sure that you would wish them to be treated well.
00:22:10.666,00:22:12.000,LIE DETECTOR TEST ADMINISTRATOR: What's your name?
00:22:12.166,00:22:13.625,Francis Gary Powers.
00:22:15.875,00:22:17.083,"LIE DETECTOR TEST ADMINISTRATOR: Rank, service?"
00:22:17.500,00:22:19.958,"First Lieutenant, United States Air Force."
00:22:22.041,00:22:25.666,"Do you have any association with the Soviet Union, Lieutenant Powers?"
00:22:25.750,00:22:26.750,Kidding?
00:22:26.833,00:22:28.250,"Just answer the questions, Lieutenant."
00:22:28.416,00:22:30.416,"Yes, no, or as simply as you can."
00:22:30.583,00:22:32.958,Do you have any association with the Soviet Union?
00:22:33.125,00:22:34.791,"Hell, no."
00:22:36.375,00:22:38.291,Do you know why you're here?
00:22:39.791,00:22:41.833,Is that a no?
00:22:42.083,00:22:44.208,Yes. I mean...
00:22:44.375,00:22:46.083,"No, it's just no."
00:22:46.250,00:22:48.625,"Yes, I have absolutely no idea why I'm here."
00:22:48.791,00:22:49.916,"Eyes front, Lieutenant."
00:22:50.041,00:22:51.458,"Yes, sir."
00:23:08.750,00:23:10.416,"How'd you do in there, Gary?"
00:23:11.666,00:23:14.166,Pretty good.
00:23:15.458,00:23:17.708,"You probably outscored Shinn, then."
00:23:19.416,00:23:20.625,Who's winning?
00:23:20.750,00:23:22.083,"Uh, that would be me."
00:23:22.250,00:23:23.583,Oh. Deal me in.
00:23:23.750,00:23:25.916,"JOE MURPHY: So, these are all mine, then."
00:23:26.083,00:23:28.500,POWERS: I told you boys not to play with him.
00:23:55.083,00:23:57.375,"Okay, drivers, here's the deal."
00:23:58.458,00:24:00.416,You've been selected for a mission...
00:24:00.583,00:24:03.958,which you are not to discuss with anyone outside of this room.
00:24:04.125,00:24:05.541,No one.
00:24:05.708,00:24:07.791,I don't care who you trust.
00:24:07.958,00:24:11.750,"Wife, mother, sweetheart."
00:24:11.916,00:24:15.916,You don't tell any of them anything of what I'm about to tell you.
00:24:18.083,00:24:21.041,Each of you drivers has met certain qualifications.
00:24:21.791,00:24:23.625,High level security clearance.
00:24:24.083,00:24:25.541,Exceptional pilot ratings...
00:24:25.625,00:24:29.500,in excess of the required hours flight time in a single-seat aircraft.
00:24:29.666,00:24:32.416,We are engaged in a war.
00:24:32.583,00:24:35.083,"This war does not, for the moment, involve men-at-arms."
00:24:35.250,00:24:36.916,It involves information.
00:24:37.083,00:24:39.083,You will be collecting information.
00:24:39.250,00:24:42.083,You will be gathering intelligence about the enemy.
00:24:42.250,00:24:45.291,The intelligence you gather could give us the upper hand...
00:24:45.458,00:24:49.250,in a full thermonuclear exchange with the Soviet Union.
00:24:50.416,00:24:51.916,Or it could prevent one.
00:24:53.125,00:24:54.916,For public purposes...
00:24:55.416,00:24:59.083,as far as your wife or mother or sweetheart or the good Lord above...
00:24:59.250,00:25:00.916,your mission does not exist.
00:25:01.083,00:25:03.750,"If it does not exist, you do not exist."
00:25:03.916,00:25:07.541,You cannot be shot down.
00:25:13.916,00:25:16.083,You work for the CIA now.
00:25:28.000,00:25:32.000,"So, Jim, I heard your guy is speaking with a phony accent."
00:25:32.916,00:25:34.875,Does he keep that up all the time?
00:25:35.041,00:25:37.500,"Actually, I'm pretty sure that's just the way he talks."
00:25:37.666,00:25:40.000,He's got the Russian name but a British passport.
00:25:40.166,00:25:42.625,"Well, I doubt that that's genuine."
00:25:42.791,00:25:45.291,"So, Jim, where are we?"
00:25:45.458,00:25:47.666,"Yes, uh, judge, you see..."
00:25:47.833,00:25:52.083,"I just don't think that three weeks is going to do it, here."
00:25:52.250,00:25:54.125,"We got a massive amount of evidence, as you know."
00:25:54.291,00:25:55.416,You wanna postpone?
00:25:55.541,00:25:56.625,Six weeks.
00:25:56.791,00:25:59.958,"There's just myself and my associate, basically."
00:26:00.125,00:26:01.625,"Jim, is this serious?"
00:26:01.750,00:26:02.750,Sir?
00:26:05.500,00:26:07.000,Is this serious?
00:26:07.291,00:26:08.708,"Yes, indeed, it is."
00:26:08.875,00:26:10.375,You can see in the filing...
00:26:10.541,00:26:13.083,"Jim, this man is a Soviet spy."
00:26:13.250,00:26:15.916,Allegedly.
00:26:17.541,00:26:18.583,Your Honor.
00:26:19.000,00:26:20.416,"Of course, I salute you."
00:26:20.583,00:26:22.583,We all salute you for taking on a thankless task.
00:26:22.750,00:26:26.250,This man has to have due process.
00:26:27.416,00:26:29.708,He'll receive a capable defense.
00:26:30.291,00:26:33.583,"And, God willing, he'll be convicted."
00:26:33.750,00:26:35.291,"Come on, Counselor."
00:26:35.458,00:26:38.916,Let's not play games with this.
00:26:39.083,00:26:40.916,We have a date...
00:26:41.083,00:26:43.500,and we're going to trial.
00:26:52.125,00:26:53.416,DONOVAN: Taxi!
00:26:54.166,00:26:55.583,Taxi!
00:26:55.750,00:26:58.916,I see your light on!
00:27:00.083,00:27:02.583,Can't wait to get back to Manhattan.
00:27:02.750,00:27:04.916,"His light was on, right?"
00:27:05.291,00:27:07.291,Son of a bitch.
00:27:54.250,00:27:57.041,MAN: Against their level of comfort.
00:27:57.250,00:27:58.458,"Oh, excuse me, sir."
00:27:58.958,00:28:00.791,Pardon me. Sorry. Whoa.
00:28:31.583,00:28:32.916,Mr. Donovan.
00:28:35.916,00:28:37.000,What?
00:28:40.916,00:28:42.375,What?
00:28:56.583,00:28:57.583,Yeah.
00:28:58.541,00:29:00.250,I just wanted to chat.
00:29:03.875,00:29:05.375,How's the case going?
00:29:05.541,00:29:07.916,Case is going great.
00:29:08.208,00:29:09.416,Mmm-hmm.
00:29:10.125,00:29:12.208,Has your guy talked?
00:29:16.041,00:29:17.583,Excuse me.
00:29:18.208,00:29:21.916,You met him. Has he talked?
00:29:23.208,00:29:25.208,We're not having this conversation.
00:29:25.375,00:29:27.041,"No, of course not."
00:29:27.208,00:29:29.291,"No, I mean, we really are not having it."
00:29:29.458,00:29:32.791,You're asking me to violate attorney-client privilege.
00:29:33.291,00:29:34.625,"Oh, come on, Counselor."
00:29:34.791,00:29:37.083,"I wish people like you would quit saying Oh, come on, Counselor."
00:29:37.250,00:29:38.666,I didn't like it the first time it happened today.
00:29:38.833,00:29:40.083,A judge said it to me twice.
00:29:40.250,00:29:42.583,"And the more I hear it, the more I don't like it."
00:29:45.625,00:29:48.000,"Okay, listen, I understand attorney-client privilege."
00:29:48.166,00:29:51.333,I understand all the legal gamesmanship.
00:29:51.416,00:29:54.083,And I understand that's how you make a living.
00:29:54.250,00:29:57.583,But I'm talking to you about something else.
00:29:58.916,00:30:00.916,The security of your country.
00:30:01.083,00:30:04.250,I'm sorry if the way I put it offends you.
00:30:04.375,00:30:07.833,But we need to know what Abel is telling you.
00:30:08.000,00:30:10.125,"You understand me, Donovan?"
00:30:10.291,00:30:12.250,We need to know.
00:30:12.416,00:30:14.833,Don't go Boy Scout on me.
00:30:15.750,00:30:17.541,"We don't have a rule book, here."
00:30:18.666,00:30:20.916,"You're Agent Hoffman, yeah?"
00:30:21.083,00:30:22.583,Yeah.
00:30:22.750,00:30:24.708,German extraction.
00:30:24.875,00:30:25.958,"Yeah, so?"
00:30:26.125,00:30:27.833,My name's Donovan. Irish.
00:30:28.000,00:30:30.458,"Both sides, mother and father."
00:30:30.625,00:30:33.708,"I'm Irish, you're German."
00:30:33.875,00:30:36.541,But what makes us both Americans?
00:30:36.708,00:30:38.875,Just one thing.
00:30:39.041,00:30:40.833,"One, one, one."
00:30:41.541,00:30:43.541,The rule book.
00:30:43.708,00:30:45.416,We call it the Constitution...
00:30:45.583,00:30:48.833,"and we agree to the rules, and that's what makes us Americans."
00:30:49.000,00:30:51.375,It's all that makes us Americans so don't tell me there's no rule book...
00:30:51.541,00:30:54.291,"and don't nod at me like that, you son of a bitch."
00:31:05.041,00:31:07.166,Do we need to worry about you?
00:31:08.083,00:31:11.083,Not if I'm left alone to do my job.
00:31:25.958,00:31:27.333,WILLIAMS: From this moment forward...
00:31:27.416,00:31:30.083,you will not refer to the U-2 as a spy plane...
00:31:30.166,00:31:31.916,or reconnaissance aircraft.
00:31:32.083,00:31:34.208,You will refer to it as The Article.
00:31:34.375,00:31:37.416,The Article has an 80-foot wingspan.
00:31:37.583,00:31:43.083,It's powered by a single Pratt and Whitney J57 P-37 engine.
00:31:43.250,00:31:45.583,"10,000 pounds of thrust..."
00:31:45.750,00:31:49.708,and a maximum speed of 430 miles an hour.
00:31:49.875,00:31:54.250,"She may not be quick, but at your cruising altitude of 70,000 feet..."
00:31:54.416,00:31:56.083,nothing will come close to you.
00:31:56.250,00:31:57.250,"POWERS: 70,000?"
00:31:57.375,00:31:59.750,The idea is the enemy doesn't even know you're there.
00:32:00.583,00:32:02.416,It looks kind of flimsy.
00:32:05.083,00:32:08.958,Every extra pound of weight costs a foot in altitude...
00:32:09.125,00:32:11.416,and we need to accommodate the cameras.
00:32:13.083,00:32:16.833,"That's a 4,500-millimeter lens, times three."
00:32:17.000,00:32:19.166,A pin-sharp panoramic camera...
00:32:19.333,00:32:23.916,four times as powerful as any aerial reconnaissance cameras we've ever used.
00:32:24.083,00:32:27.250,"You're gonna be taking pictures, lots of pictures."
00:32:27.416,00:32:28.750,"At 70,000 feet..."
00:32:28.833,00:32:33.583,"The Article can photograph 2,000 square miles of territory in one pass."
00:32:34.125,00:32:37.833,"Now, drivers, give Agent Sumner your undivided attention."
00:32:38.666,00:32:41.416,The items you will need on your mission are over here.
00:32:43.000,00:32:45.500,"BLASCO: B camera, Revere 8 model 40 magazine..."
00:32:45.666,00:32:47.958,"Keystone Capri K-25, silver."
00:32:48.125,00:32:50.125,Hollow-handle shaving brush.
00:32:50.291,00:32:53.583,Complete set of cipher tables on edible silver foil.
00:32:53.750,00:32:56.083,Specialist photographic equipment.
00:32:57.583,00:33:00.416,"Yeah, we, uh, get the idea."
00:33:12.416,00:33:15.583,"Uh, excuse me, Agent, uh, Bosco."
00:33:15.750,00:33:16.916,BLASCO: Sir.
00:33:17.333,00:33:21.625,There seems to be a subsection to this list here.
00:33:22.416,00:33:24.333,Most of this stuff came from his studio...
00:33:24.500,00:33:26.583,but the rest is from the hotel room he was holed up in.
00:33:27.166,00:33:29.000,Where we found him.
00:33:29.791,00:33:31.500,The hotel room you searched?
00:33:32.166,00:33:33.333,"Well, yeah."
00:33:33.750,00:33:35.875,Can I see the warrant?
00:33:36.041,00:33:37.416,The what?
00:33:38.625,00:33:41.083,"Yeah, explain this to me."
00:33:41.375,00:33:42.625,There was a warrant.
00:33:42.791,00:33:44.958,A civil detention writ for the arrest of an alien...
00:33:45.125,00:33:48.375,but there was no search warrant for suspicion of criminal activity.
00:33:48.541,00:33:51.416,"So, the search and the evidence that is the fruit of that search..."
00:33:51.583,00:33:53.500,that's all tainted and should not be admitted.
00:33:53.666,00:33:56.083,"What protections is he due, Your Honor?"
00:33:56.250,00:33:59.000,The man is what?
00:33:59.166,00:34:00.958,He is a Soviet citizen.
00:34:01.125,00:34:02.708,He's not an American.
00:34:02.875,00:34:06.500,"1886, Yick Wo v. Hopkins."
00:34:06.666,00:34:10.083,"The court held that even aliens, in that case Chinese immigrants..."
00:34:10.208,00:34:12.958,could not be held to answer for a crime without due process of law...
00:34:13.125,00:34:15.166,including any alien that entered the country illegally.
00:34:15.833,00:34:20.333,The Department of Justice has its first allegiance to the United States.
00:34:20.500,00:34:22.875,"I don't see how an alien, if he's here illegally..."
00:34:23.041,00:34:25.625,how he suffered deprivation of rights.
00:34:25.791,00:34:27.375,Rights as what?
00:34:27.541,00:34:29.250,An American?
00:34:29.416,00:34:32.250,"Rights as what, Counselor?"
00:34:32.416,00:34:34.083,We're in a battle for civilization.
00:34:34.208,00:34:37.416,This Russian spy came here to threaten our way of life.
00:34:37.708,00:34:39.750,"Now, I have a courtroom of people waiting."
00:34:39.916,00:34:41.708,"Get out there, sit beside the Russian."
00:34:41.875,00:34:43.916,Let's get this over and done with.
00:34:44.083,00:34:46.250,And your motion is denied.
00:34:48.833,00:34:51.375,He should take some insurance out on himself.
00:34:51.958,00:34:53.291,How did we do?
00:34:53.458,00:34:54.583,In there?
00:34:55.833,00:34:56.833,Um...
00:34:56.958,00:34:58.791,Not too good.
00:34:58.958,00:35:00.916,"Apparently, you're not an American citizen."
00:35:01.083,00:35:02.625,That's true.
00:35:03.000,00:35:06.458,"And according to your boss, you're not a Soviet citizen either."
00:35:07.416,00:35:10.166,"Well, the boss isn't always right..."
00:35:11.291,00:35:13.625,but he's always the boss.
00:35:18.083,00:35:19.166,Do you never worry?
00:35:20.416,00:35:21.958,Would it help?
00:35:29.125,00:35:30.250,All rise.
00:35:33.000,00:35:36.375,ALL: I pledge allegiance to the Flag...
00:35:36.541,00:35:39.708,of the United States of America...
00:35:39.875,00:35:43.708,and to the Republic for which it stands...
00:35:43.875,00:35:48.375,"one Nation under God, indivisible..."
00:35:48.541,00:35:51.375,with liberty and justice for all.
00:35:54.916,00:35:58.750,"NARRATOR: First, you have to know what happens when an atomic bomb explodes."
00:36:01.375,00:36:04.416,"There is a bright flash, brighter than the sun."
00:36:04.583,00:36:08.291,"It can smash in buildings, break windows all over town."
00:36:10.833,00:36:13.958,But if you duck and cover like Bert...
00:36:14.125,00:36:15.875,you will be much safer.
00:36:16.041,00:36:18.083,There are two kinds of attack...
00:36:18.250,00:36:20.625,with warning and without any warning.
00:36:21.750,00:36:24.000,DONOVAN: Hmm.
00:36:25.625,00:36:26.583,What's going on in here?
00:36:26.708,00:36:28.000,"ROGER: Okay, Dad, this is really important."
00:36:28.625,00:36:30.625,"When the war begins, the first thing they do..."
00:36:30.791,00:36:33.083,is cut off all the water and all the electricity.
00:36:33.500,00:36:35.458,So the first thing we should do is keep this filled...
00:36:35.708,00:36:37.083,use the shower in your room...
00:36:37.166,00:36:39.458,"use the sink downstairs, the garden hose outside..."
00:36:39.625,00:36:41.041,Those are good ideas.
00:36:41.708,00:36:45.708,"But, Roger, I don't see this as being something you ever have to worry about."
00:36:47.166,00:36:48.416,"Yeah, but when you hear the sirens..."
00:36:48.583,00:36:51.583,there may not be enough time to fill the tub and the sinks.
00:36:52.541,00:36:54.333,Not gonna be any sirens...
00:36:55.583,00:36:56.750,What is this?
00:36:57.083,00:37:00.583,"When the bomb comes, the Reds will aim for the Empire State Building."
00:37:00.833,00:37:03.208,"But the bomb goes off at 10,000 feet up."
00:37:03.583,00:37:07.416,"In Life magazine, it's called an airburst, and if the bomb is 50 megatons..."
00:37:07.833,00:37:10.750,the blast wave goes out and out and out...
00:37:10.916,00:37:13.250,and melts everything from here to here.
00:37:13.416,00:37:14.916,Including where we live. Here.
00:37:16.208,00:37:17.458,"Yeah, right there."
00:37:17.750,00:37:21.083,"But, you know, Roger, no one is dropping atomic bombs on us."
00:37:21.375,00:37:22.708,But the Russians want to.
00:37:22.875,00:37:24.416,You know that Russian guy you're defending?
00:37:24.916,00:37:27.583,He's here to get things ready for the guys who drop the bombs.
00:37:27.750,00:37:29.750,"Oh, no, he's not here for that."
00:37:30.041,00:37:31.291,He's not even Russian.
00:37:31.458,00:37:33.250,"He was born, we think, in Northern England."
00:37:33.416,00:37:34.916,"Yeah, but he's a spy for Russia."
00:37:36.250,00:37:38.041,I don't even understand what you're doing.
00:37:38.208,00:37:40.416,"You're not a Communist, so why are you defending one?"
00:37:40.583,00:37:41.958,"Well, because it's my job."
00:37:42.583,00:37:44.041,It never used to be.
00:38:14.250,00:38:16.583,CLERK: In the case of the United States of America...
00:38:16.750,00:38:18.750,versus Rudolf Abel...
00:38:18.916,00:38:21.166,as to the first count in the indictment...
00:38:21.333,00:38:23.375,how do you find the defendant?
00:38:23.541,00:38:25.916,Guilty or not guilty?
00:38:26.041,00:38:27.083,Guilty.
00:38:28.375,00:38:29.958,CLERK: As to the second count?
00:38:30.458,00:38:31.583,Guilty.
00:38:32.208,00:38:34.041,CLERK: As to the third count?
00:38:34.416,00:38:35.416,Guilty.
00:38:35.625,00:38:37.875,"Your Honor, I make a motion to set aside these guilty verdicts..."
00:38:38.000,00:38:39.500,against the weight of evidence.
00:38:39.583,00:38:41.000,Denied.
00:38:41.250,00:38:43.166,The jury is discharged.
00:38:43.333,00:38:45.208,Thank you all.
00:38:45.375,00:38:47.208,"I would like to add that, if I were one of you..."
00:38:47.375,00:38:49.541,I would've reached the same verdict.
00:38:50.416,00:38:53.458,Sentencing will be...
00:38:54.750,00:38:56.625,November 15.
00:39:05.250,00:39:07.583,The death sentence is not a foregone conclusion.
00:39:07.750,00:39:08.750,Don't worry.
00:39:09.916,00:39:12.416,"I'm not afraid to die, Mr. Donovan."
00:39:15.083,00:39:16.791,Although...
00:39:16.958,00:39:19.083,it wouldn't be my first choice.
00:39:22.958,00:39:25.458,You left this behind.
00:39:26.833,00:39:28.208,"Oh, thank you."
00:39:30.833,00:39:32.750,"Oh, thank you very much!"
00:39:52.333,00:39:55.000,You've never asked me if the charges were true.
00:39:57.375,00:40:01.708,If I am indeed a spy.
00:40:02.541,00:40:03.958,This is how we do it.
00:40:04.416,00:40:06.291,The case against you matters.
00:40:06.458,00:40:08.083,Making them prove it matters.
00:40:08.250,00:40:09.916,The fiction is...
00:40:10.083,00:40:11.875,Whether you did it or not doesn't matter.
00:40:11.958,00:40:14.916,"The state has to prove it, that you're a spy."
00:40:15.083,00:40:16.791,So you're not curious?
00:40:17.250,00:40:20.708,"No, not really."
00:40:21.000,00:40:23.250,"My wife, she's the artist."
00:40:23.416,00:40:25.583,She's a musician...
00:40:25.750,00:40:29.041,in the Children's Orchestra of Moscow.
00:40:29.541,00:40:31.041,What instrument?
00:40:31.208,00:40:32.750,The harp.
00:40:33.041,00:40:35.000,Oh. Hmm.
00:40:35.083,00:40:37.416,"Then, she's an angel."
00:40:46.958,00:40:48.375,Standing there like that...
00:40:48.458,00:40:52.333,you remind me of a man who used to come to our house when I was young.
00:40:53.416,00:40:56.916,"My father used to say, Watch this man."
00:40:58.083,00:41:01.125,"So I did, every time he came."
00:41:01.625,00:41:04.250,And never once...
00:41:04.416,00:41:08.583,did he do anything remarkable.
00:41:09.500,00:41:11.791,And I remind you of him?
00:41:14.916,00:41:18.708,"This one time, I was about the age of your son."
00:41:18.875,00:41:22.208,Our house was overrun by partisan border guards.
00:41:25.916,00:41:27.958,Dozens of them.
00:41:28.125,00:41:30.250,"My father was beaten, my mother was beaten..."
00:41:30.333,00:41:34.083,"and this man, my father's friend, he was beaten."
00:41:35.625,00:41:37.791,And I watched this man.
00:41:40.791,00:41:43.333,Every time they hit him...
00:41:44.458,00:41:46.541,he stood back up again.
00:41:48.333,00:41:50.916,So they hit him harder.
00:41:52.041,00:41:54.333,"Still, he got back to his feet."
00:41:57.625,00:41:59.958,I think because of this they stopped the beating.
00:42:00.083,00:42:01.791,They let him live.
00:42:10.083,00:42:12.416,saying it.
00:42:19.750,00:42:22.041,"It sort of means, like, uh..."
00:42:24.416,00:42:26.416,standing man.
00:42:29.541,00:42:32.500,Standing man.
00:42:42.166,00:42:44.583,"Hello, Jim!"
00:42:44.750,00:42:46.916,"Oh, Mortie's busy getting kitted out."
00:42:47.416,00:42:49.000,But come on in.
00:42:50.458,00:42:53.125,"Scotch, Jim?"
00:42:53.291,00:42:55.250,"Uh, just a drop of water."
00:42:55.791,00:42:57.083,Your Honor.
00:42:57.250,00:42:59.750,"Hello, Jim!"
00:42:59.916,00:43:01.250,Got a few minutes though.
00:43:01.916,00:43:05.041,March of Dimes thing.
00:43:05.125,00:43:06.541,Hmm.
00:43:06.625,00:43:08.000,Thank you for seeing me.
00:43:08.083,00:43:12.250,I... I just wanted to give you my two cents on the sentencing.
00:43:12.375,00:43:15.500,And I thought maybe I should pester you at home...
00:43:15.625,00:43:18.416,as not all of my points are narrowly legal.
00:43:18.583,00:43:21.208,"Yeah, well, it's that kind of case."
00:43:21.375,00:43:25.250,I hope I wasn't too scratchy during the trial but it's exactly what you say.
00:43:26.125,00:43:28.916,Nothing about this is narrowly legal.
00:43:29.625,00:43:31.500,There are bigger issues.
00:43:32.625,00:43:34.250,Bigger issues!
00:43:36.500,00:43:39.250,"Thank you, thank you. Uh..."
00:43:42.916,00:43:47.625,I think it could be considered in the best interests of the United States...
00:43:47.750,00:43:50.916,that Abel remain alive.
00:43:51.666,00:43:52.916,Why?
00:43:53.083,00:43:56.083,I'm not saying I've made up my mind but if he was gonna cooperate...
00:43:56.166,00:43:57.791,"work with the government, he would've done it already."
00:43:57.958,00:43:59.708,"True, but the issue here..."
00:43:59.875,00:44:01.583,Excuse me.
00:44:05.708,00:44:08.875,You can't say it's in the best interest of the United States...
00:44:09.041,00:44:13.083,that he spend the rest of his days in a prison cell.
00:44:13.250,00:44:15.166,How is this the national interest?
00:44:15.333,00:44:17.750,"Not the incarceration itself, sir."
00:44:18.916,00:44:22.041,"It is possible that, in the foreseeable future..."
00:44:22.208,00:44:24.500,an American of equivalent rank...
00:44:24.666,00:44:26.416,might be captured by Soviet Russia.
00:44:27.083,00:44:29.541,We might want to have someone to trade.
00:44:29.708,00:44:31.083,Wow.
00:44:31.250,00:44:33.250,That sounds like spinning what-ifs.
00:44:33.333,00:44:35.083,You could do that till the cows come home.
00:44:35.208,00:44:37.916,"It's my business, what-ifs."
00:44:38.083,00:44:40.583,There's nothing implausible about this one.
00:44:40.750,00:44:43.041,It's entirely in the realm of what could happen.
00:44:43.791,00:44:47.125,It's the kind of probability that people buy insurance for.
00:44:47.291,00:44:51.291,"If we send this guy to his death, we leave ourselves wide open."
00:44:51.458,00:44:54.125,No policy in our back pocket...
00:44:54.291,00:44:56.250,for the day the storm comes.
00:44:58.208,00:44:59.750,Nice speech.
00:45:00.583,00:45:05.083,"Sir, there is also the humanitarian argument."
00:45:05.750,00:45:09.583,Should he die for doing the job they sent him to do?
00:45:11.416,00:45:13.916,"All right, Counselor."
00:45:15.166,00:45:17.333,I gotta run.
00:45:20.208,00:45:22.416,"Good seeing you, Jim."
00:45:25.666,00:45:28.250,I'll walk you out.
00:45:30.458,00:45:31.625,BAILIFF: All rise.
00:45:33.083,00:45:37.000,The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York is now in session.
00:45:37.166,00:45:39.750,The honorable Mortimer Byers presiding.
00:45:44.083,00:45:46.250,Be seated.
00:45:57.166,00:45:59.333,BYERS: The defendant will please rise.
00:46:13.750,00:46:16.625,In the measured judgment of this court the following sentence...
00:46:16.791,00:46:19.083,based upon the jury's verdict of guilty...
00:46:19.250,00:46:21.291,as to each count of the indictment...
00:46:21.458,00:46:25.833,is believed to meet the test which has been stated.
00:46:26.000,00:46:29.416,Pursuant to the verdict of guilty as to all counts...
00:46:31.750,00:46:33.541,the defendant is committed to the custody...
00:46:33.625,00:46:36.500,of the Attorney General of the United States...
00:46:37.750,00:46:39.875,for imprisonment in a federal institution...
00:46:40.000,00:46:43.583,to be selected by him for a period of 30 years.
00:46:44.875,00:46:46.958,"BYERS: Marshals, you may take the defendant into custody."
00:46:47.125,00:46:48.208,No electrocution?
00:46:48.375,00:46:49.375,"No, no, no."
00:46:49.916,00:46:51.250,Why aren't we hanging him?
00:46:51.416,00:46:52.916,"In the name of God, why aren't we hanging him?"
00:46:53.083,00:46:54.416,"Sit down, sir!"
00:46:54.708,00:46:57.541,MAN: He's a spy!
00:46:58.333,00:47:00.041,"In the name of God, why aren't we hanging him?"
00:47:00.166,00:47:01.166,That's right!
00:47:02.916,00:47:04.583,MAN: He's a spy!
00:47:08.750,00:47:10.583,REPORTER 1: Mr. Donovan!
00:47:10.708,00:47:13.625,Just one question.
00:47:20.416,00:47:22.541,My hat! My hat!
00:47:24.583,00:47:25.833,Nobody here has a comment.
00:47:26.000,00:47:27.750,Mr. and Mrs. Donovan are not answering questions.
00:47:27.916,00:47:30.083,REPORTER 2: How do you feel now that this national nightmare is over?
00:47:30.375,00:47:31.916,"REPORTER 3: Mr. Donovan, are you happy with the verdict?"
00:47:32.083,00:47:35.083,We're in firm ground for a case on appeal.
00:47:35.250,00:47:36.666,Appeal?
00:47:50.958,00:47:52.625,"WATTERS: Jim, you did a great job."
00:47:52.791,00:47:55.000,You fulfilled your mandate and then some.
00:47:55.500,00:47:57.166,But the man is a spy.
00:47:57.333,00:47:59.833,The verdict is correct and there's no reason to appeal it.
00:48:00.000,00:48:01.666,There's ample procedural reason.
00:48:01.750,00:48:03.375,We know the search is tainted.
00:48:03.458,00:48:06.333,Fourth Amendment issues will always weigh more heavily in an appellate forum.
00:48:06.416,00:48:07.708,We've got a good shot.
00:48:07.875,00:48:10.541,What the goddamn hell are you talking about?
00:48:10.958,00:48:14.250,"We were supposed to show he had a capable defense, which we did."
00:48:14.333,00:48:16.833,Why are you citing the goddamn Constitution at me?
00:48:17.000,00:48:18.458,"Tom, if you look me in the eye..."
00:48:18.583,00:48:21.791,"and tell me we don't have grounds for an appeal, I'll drop it right now."
00:48:21.916,00:48:24.041,I'm not saying that.
00:48:24.125,00:48:25.916,Tom is saying there's a cost to these things.
00:48:26.083,00:48:27.708,That's right.
00:48:27.875,00:48:30.625,A cost to both your family and your firm.
00:49:05.250,00:49:07.458,I've missed music.
00:49:07.625,00:49:10.750,They checked the radio to make sure there was no transmitter in it.
00:49:10.875,00:49:12.916,I'm sure they did.
00:49:14.750,00:49:16.750,Shostakovich.
00:49:18.541,00:49:21.375,"That's a very great artist, Shostakovich."
00:49:36.583,00:49:38.041,I think...
00:49:39.750,00:49:42.916,our strongest grounds for reversal...
00:49:43.458,00:49:45.458,are constitutional.
00:49:47.750,00:49:51.583,Our best chance is if the Supreme Court agrees to review our case.
00:49:57.041,00:49:59.250,Jim...
00:50:05.166,00:50:06.958,You should be careful.
00:50:12.250,00:50:13.583,Careful.
00:50:18.333,00:50:19.833,Edward Byrnes.
00:50:23.375,00:50:24.708,And Richard Long.
00:50:25.916,00:50:27.083,"Good morning, Suzanne."
00:50:27.250,00:50:30.333,"Good morning, Dick."
00:50:31.750,00:50:33.250,"Oh, her."
00:50:43.708,00:50:45.166,Mom!
00:50:46.250,00:50:48.166,What in God's name happened?
00:50:48.250,00:50:49.666,"Honey, are you all right?"
00:50:49.833,00:50:51.083,Mom!
00:50:51.250,00:50:52.916,MARY: I've got her.
00:50:55.875,00:50:57.083,Are you all right?
00:50:57.250,00:50:58.833,Are you okay?
00:50:59.000,00:51:01.666,"Dad, I sat with my back against the wall!"
00:51:01.833,00:51:03.166,"Good, good, good."
00:51:03.333,00:51:05.250,"Good boy, good boy."
00:51:05.416,00:51:06.916,It's okay.
00:51:07.083,00:51:09.541,"It's all right, they're gone."
00:51:09.625,00:51:11.083,They're cowards.
00:51:11.166,00:51:13.916,We have detectives canvassing the neighborhood.
00:51:14.000,00:51:15.750,Maybe we'll find a description of the car...
00:51:15.833,00:51:17.250,but I don't think it's very likely.
00:51:17.333,00:51:19.041,We're gonna need protection.
00:51:19.208,00:51:21.791,"Oh, I have instructions to leave two cars here."
00:51:21.958,00:51:23.958,It'll be pretty obvious that this is a secure...
00:51:24.125,00:51:26.458,I have to be in Washington later on this week.
00:51:26.583,00:51:28.791,What are you doing?
00:51:28.958,00:51:30.250,"Pardon me, Officer?"
00:51:30.375,00:51:31.416,You're still defending this guy?
00:51:31.541,00:51:32.625,What are you fighting for him for?
00:51:32.750,00:51:34.458,"Okay, knock that off, Officer."
00:51:34.583,00:51:37.375,I'll knock off nothing.
00:51:37.541,00:51:38.583,I did my time in the service.
00:51:38.750,00:51:40.250,"I was fighting these guys, and you're defending them?"
00:51:40.416,00:51:43.000,Why don't you just do your job as an officer of the law?
00:51:43.166,00:51:44.833,"Okay, I'm sorry."
00:51:45.000,00:51:46.291,Just forget him.
00:51:46.416,00:51:47.666,What am I not getting here?
00:51:47.791,00:51:50.583,"Outside, Officer."
00:51:51.583,00:51:54.583,OFFICER: Defending a commie spy. Jeez!
00:52:12.083,00:52:14.083,"REPORTER: Do you feel that you deserve this, sir?"
00:52:36.625,00:52:40.916,WILLIAMS: Should it become necessary to abandon the aircraft over Soviet territory...
00:52:41.125,00:52:43.708,then there's a two-and-a-half pound explosive charge...
00:52:43.875,00:52:45.958,contained within the fuselage.
00:52:46.125,00:52:47.375,"Now, first..."
00:52:47.541,00:52:49.875,you activate the circuits.
00:52:51.250,00:52:53.916,But to start the 70-second timer...
00:52:54.083,00:52:57.000,you need to flip the switch marked Destruct.
00:52:59.750,00:53:03.916,It is imperative that these flights remain a secret...
00:53:04.083,00:53:07.250,and this equipment does not fall into enemy hands.
00:53:07.416,00:53:09.208,What about us?
00:53:09.375,00:53:11.875,"I don't know if you're kidding, Lieutenant Powers."
00:53:12.041,00:53:13.583,I'm not.
00:53:15.583,00:53:20.083,What you know about the plane is as secret as the plane itself.
00:53:21.291,00:53:24.708,If capture is a foregone conclusion...
00:53:24.875,00:53:26.750,you go down with your plane.
00:53:26.916,00:53:29.666,"Now, if you think you can ditch and get away..."
00:53:29.750,00:53:31.291,"if you're close enough to a border, fine."
00:53:31.416,00:53:34.250,You know the ejection protocol.
00:53:35.458,00:53:37.833,But if you ditch...
00:53:38.041,00:53:40.041,you bring the dollar with you.
00:53:40.208,00:53:42.791,"All right, there's a pin inside."
00:53:44.583,00:53:47.791,"You scratch your skin anywhere, it's instantaneous."
00:53:47.958,00:53:50.791,If you think you are about to be captured...
00:53:50.958,00:53:52.791,you use it.
00:53:56.083,00:53:58.916,"Drivers, you understand me?"
00:53:59.791,00:54:01.541,Spend the dollar.
00:54:56.041,00:54:58.541,"DONOVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court."
00:54:58.708,00:55:02.166,"The Cold War is not just a phrase, Your Honor."
00:55:02.333,00:55:04.541,It's not just a figure of speech.
00:55:04.708,00:55:06.708,"Truly, a battle is being fought..."
00:55:06.791,00:55:10.500,between two competing views of the world.
00:55:10.666,00:55:14.125,I contend that Rudolf Ivanovich Abel...
00:55:14.291,00:55:18.333,"Colonel Abel, as he was called even by the men who arrested him..."
00:55:18.500,00:55:21.583,is our foe in that battle.
00:55:22.041,00:55:23.583,Auxiliary power?
00:55:23.750,00:55:25.333,Connected and on.
00:55:25.500,00:55:27.458,Oxygen seat-pack supply?
00:55:27.625,00:55:29.250,Supply at 1800 psi.
00:55:29.416,00:55:30.708,Inverter?
00:55:30.875,00:55:32.083,"On, light out."
00:55:32.250,00:55:35.333,He was treated as a combatant in that war...
00:55:35.500,00:55:39.333,until it no longer suited our government to so treat him.
00:55:39.500,00:55:41.083,Accordingly...
00:55:41.250,00:55:45.083,he was not given the protections we give our own citizens.
00:55:45.250,00:55:46.708,He was subjected to treatment that...
00:55:46.875,00:55:49.416,however appropriate for a suspected enemy...
00:55:49.583,00:55:52.291,was not appropriate to a suspected criminal.
00:55:52.500,00:55:54.583,Fuel transfer?
00:55:54.750,00:55:55.916,Destructor?
00:55:56.083,00:55:57.083,Destructor safety.
00:55:57.250,00:55:58.375,Climb data card.
00:55:58.541,00:55:59.916,Installed in aircraft.
00:56:14.083,00:56:15.583,I know this man.
00:56:15.750,00:56:16.916,If the charge is true...
00:56:17.083,00:56:19.291,he serves a foreign power but he serves it faithfully.
00:56:19.458,00:56:23.250,"If he is a soldier in the opposing army, he is a good soldier."
00:56:23.416,00:56:26.333,He has not fled the field of battle to save himself.
00:56:26.500,00:56:28.958,He has refused to serve his captor.
00:56:29.125,00:56:31.250,He has refused to betray his cause.
00:56:31.416,00:56:33.916,He has refused to take the coward's way out.
00:56:34.083,00:56:38.416,The coward must abandon his dignity before he abandons the field of battle.
00:56:38.541,00:56:41.375,"That, Rudolf Abel will never do."
00:56:41.541,00:56:42.875,Shouldn't we...
00:56:43.041,00:56:45.166,by giving him the full benefit...
00:56:45.333,00:56:47.500,of the rights that define our system of government...
00:56:47.666,00:56:50.333,show this man who we are?
00:56:50.583,00:56:52.625,Who we are.
00:56:52.916,00:56:57.250,Is that not the greatest weapon we have in this Cold War?
00:56:57.416,00:57:02.666,Will we stand by our cause less resolutely than he stands by his?
00:59:45.916,00:59:47.333,The President announced...
00:59:47.500,00:59:50.833,that a NASA weather plane disappeared four days ago north of Turkey.
00:59:51.000,00:59:53.583,And the Space Administration fears...
00:59:53.750,00:59:55.625,that its pilot died in the crash.
00:59:56.083,00:59:58.916,Radar showed the plane wandering off course...
00:59:59.083,01:00:02.916,deep into Soviet territory before contact was lost...
01:00:03.083,01:00:05.083,complicating any effort to recover it...
01:00:05.250,01:00:07.125,or the remains of the pilot.
01:00:07.291,01:00:09.416,Now to news out of Washington.
01:00:09.583,01:00:11.083,In a close vote today...
01:00:11.166,01:00:13.083,the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction...
01:00:13.208,01:00:16.083,of Russian spy Rudolf Ivanovich Abel...
01:00:16.208,01:00:17.875,five votes to four.
01:00:17.958,01:00:20.250,The case presented civil liberties issues...
01:00:20.333,01:00:23.750,"according to the Russian's lawyer, James B. Donovan."
01:00:24.166,01:00:26.416,When asked how he felt about today's loss...
01:00:26.625,01:00:30.125,"Mr. Donovan simply said, Tired."
01:00:30.291,01:00:32.250,I'll have more news for you after this message.
01:00:36.541,01:00:42.958,exciting styling tricks Marty.
01:00:43.125,01:00:45.958,I'll be damned if I can find the file on that Prudential case.
01:00:46.083,01:00:49.500,"I, uh... Mr. Watters had me move it over to Jack Elwes's office..."
01:00:49.583,01:00:51.416,along with the first draft of the appeal.
01:00:51.541,01:00:52.541,He did?
01:00:52.625,01:00:56.333,"Yeah, he redrafted and filed that last week while you were in Washington."
01:00:58.958,01:01:00.333,WATTERS: How long have we been together?
01:01:00.416,01:01:02.583,You act as if I've never closed a deal.
01:01:02.708,01:01:05.583,Set up a meeting.
01:01:05.750,01:01:09.583,I'm betting Mr. Young would like some of the finer things New York has to offer.
01:01:09.708,01:01:11.833,And I want you to give me the summary of...
01:01:30.041,01:01:31.958,Do you know anyone from Leipzig?
01:01:32.125,01:01:36.125,Leipzig.
01:01:36.750,01:01:38.541,From East Germany.
01:01:47.208,01:01:49.166,Is it your wife?
01:01:49.333,01:01:50.333,No.
01:01:51.291,01:01:53.208,"No, no, no."
01:01:53.375,01:01:57.500,She pretends to be but it's not even a good pretense.
01:01:58.500,01:02:03.375,I'm taking this liberty to write to you after having learned from the newspapers...
01:02:03.541,01:02:10.250,"about your most humane attitude towards my beloved husband, Rudolf Abel."
01:02:11.500,01:02:14.333,And do I write back?
01:02:16.708,01:02:18.250,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:02:21.750,01:02:25.833,What's the next move when you don't know what the game is?
01:02:27.208,01:02:29.000,TRANSLATOR: Francis Gary Powers...
01:02:30.708,01:02:35.583,on the strength of Article Two of the USSR law...
01:02:35.750,01:02:39.541,on criminal responsibility for state crimes...
01:02:39.708,01:02:41.750,to 10 years of confinement...
01:02:41.875,01:02:45.541,with the first three years to be served in prison.
01:02:46.875,01:02:51.416,"The term of the punishment, including preliminary detention..."
01:02:51.583,01:02:56.041,"shall be counted from May first, nineteen hundred and sixty."
01:03:21.916,01:03:24.458,"DULLES: Mr. Donovan, thank you so much for coming."
01:03:24.625,01:03:26.833,"It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Dulles."
01:03:27.000,01:03:28.750,"It's an honor, sir."
01:03:29.583,01:03:33.208,"Nescafe, cream, two lumps."
01:03:33.916,01:03:35.125,Thank you.
01:03:35.916,01:03:38.000,"Okay, this letter you received."
01:03:38.166,01:03:41.125,Seems pretty clear that the Soviets are making an overture here.
01:03:42.041,01:03:43.541,They're doing it through East Germany...
01:03:43.625,01:03:46.250,because they still don't want to acknowledge Abel as a Soviet citizen...
01:03:46.333,01:03:48.625,much less a Soviet spy.
01:03:49.750,01:03:51.250,Lot of fiction going on.
01:03:51.416,01:03:53.583,"Yes, sir, but to what end?"
01:03:53.750,01:03:57.833,"They got our guy, our spy pilot."
01:04:00.083,01:04:03.541,"Prisoner exchange, I think that's what they're after."
01:04:03.708,01:04:05.916,"Which could hardly be a surprise to you, Counselor."
01:04:06.083,01:04:08.750,It's an eventuality that I think you foresaw.
01:04:09.041,01:04:12.083,"Yes, I sure did, and I'm so rarely right."
01:04:12.500,01:04:15.583,congratulations.
01:04:15.750,01:04:19.416,"Now, we have our man over there. Powers."
01:04:19.583,01:04:23.583,"Good man, but with a head full of classified information."
01:04:23.750,01:04:26.333,"Abel has a head full of classified information, too..."
01:04:26.416,01:04:28.083,but he hasn't given us a lick.
01:04:28.250,01:04:29.791,"Sir, take it from me, he won't."
01:04:29.958,01:04:32.458,"Yes, we know that, but the Russians don't."
01:04:32.625,01:04:35.125,They want their man back before he cracks.
01:04:35.291,01:04:39.375,And we want Powers back for the same reasons.
01:04:41.750,01:04:43.791,"DONOVAN: I think you are saying, sir..."
01:04:43.958,01:04:46.750,that there might be a happy ending for everyone.
01:04:47.291,01:04:50.458,"Yes, if we, um, indulge their fiction."
01:04:57.833,01:04:59.791,We want you to negotiate the swap...
01:04:59.958,01:05:02.833,"because you're a private citizen, so it's not governments talking."
01:05:03.833,01:05:06.250,They don't acknowledge Abel as a Soviet citizen...
01:05:06.416,01:05:09.750,and we don't acknowledge East Germany as a sovereign country.
01:05:09.916,01:05:13.958,We haven't recognized East Berlin since it was annexed by the Soviets in '45.
01:05:14.125,01:05:17.125,"So I act as a negotiator, representing..."
01:05:17.291,01:05:18.958,You're not representing anybody.
01:05:19.125,01:05:21.958,Not a government official.
01:05:22.666,01:05:24.708,"So, some fiction on our side as well."
01:05:24.791,01:05:25.750,Correct.
01:05:25.875,01:05:31.750,"Which means, of course, you can't rely on any acknowledgment or help if things go south."
01:05:31.916,01:05:33.875,CIA can't be responsible.
01:05:34.083,01:05:36.458,We can't be embarrassed.
01:05:38.375,01:05:40.833,Where do they want this negotiation to take place?
01:05:41.000,01:05:42.250,There.
01:05:42.333,01:05:43.416,There?
01:05:43.583,01:05:45.416,East Berlin.
01:05:47.083,01:05:49.375,Isn't East Berlin getting rather...
01:05:49.541,01:05:52.000,"Oh, yes, the place is getting complicated."
01:05:53.708,01:05:55.291,"Yeah, complicated."
01:05:57.583,01:06:01.000,The Soviet side has been setting up checkpoints for the past few months...
01:06:01.166,01:06:03.458,to try to stop people hemorrhaging to the Western sectors...
01:06:03.625,01:06:05.000,and it hasn't worked.
01:06:05.458,01:06:09.083,We have intelligence to suggest that they may go one step further...
01:06:09.250,01:06:12.583,and wall off the entire Eastern sector.
01:06:17.250,01:06:19.750,"Okay, that's it in a nutshell."
01:06:19.916,01:06:22.250,The decision is entirely yours.
01:06:22.416,01:06:25.500,You need time to kick it around.
01:06:31.458,01:06:32.958,No.
01:06:33.875,01:06:35.041,"No, I don't."
01:06:35.208,01:06:37.708,"Well, fine. Fine."
01:06:37.875,01:06:39.791,Best that this all remains confidential.
01:06:39.958,01:06:45.166,Let's not discuss any of this with Mary or with anyone else.
01:06:45.333,01:06:47.500,Share the correspondence only with us.
01:06:47.666,01:06:49.416,Let us know what they want to do and when.
01:06:49.583,01:06:52.166,"I've got no client, no wife, no country."
01:06:52.333,01:06:55.500,Don't know what I'm doing or when or who for.
01:06:55.666,01:06:59.041,"You're doing it for your country, but your country doesn't know that yet."
01:06:59.208,01:07:02.250,"What about my client, the other person in this equation? My guy?"
01:07:02.375,01:07:04.083,Your guy?
01:07:04.250,01:07:05.916,"He's not your guy anymore, Counselor."
01:07:06.000,01:07:08.791,Your guy is Francis Gary Powers now.
01:07:09.416,01:07:12.083,What do I tell Rudolf Abel?
01:07:12.250,01:07:14.250,Tell him not to drop dead.
01:09:06.708,01:09:08.166,Professor?
01:09:13.750,01:09:14.833,Professor?
01:09:15.666,01:09:19.291,Papa went to university.
01:09:19.916,01:09:21.625,They're having classes today?
01:09:21.791,01:09:23.958,He went to see.
01:09:24.125,01:09:25.458,What are you doing here?
01:09:25.625,01:09:27.291,I came to get you and your father.
01:09:27.458,01:09:29.541,You have to come with me.
01:09:29.708,01:09:30.875,Just leave?
01:09:31.041,01:09:33.500,"Yes, yes, leave."
01:10:04.875,01:10:06.875,PRYOR: Go back.
01:10:07.041,01:10:09.125,"I'll be okay, I'm American. Go back."
01:10:09.291,01:10:11.750,Go back to your father's.
01:10:19.083,01:10:20.750,"So, hi."
01:10:23.916,01:10:25.416,"Papers, please."
01:10:25.583,01:10:27.583,Ich bin Student Frederic Pryor.
01:10:28.541,01:10:30.083,"Yes, Student."
01:10:41.083,01:10:43.458,My name's Frederic Pryor.
01:10:45.416,01:10:49.750,See? Ahh!
01:10:52.750,01:10:56.916,Look. The foreign trade system of the European Communist nations. Huh?
01:10:57.041,01:10:59.041,Um...
01:11:02.166,01:11:04.000,It was a lot of work.
01:11:11.166,01:11:13.583,"No, that's my only copy."
01:11:19.000,01:11:20.375,MARY: Tell me something.
01:11:20.541,01:11:22.500,It came up at the last minute.
01:11:22.583,01:11:24.666,They have offices in London.
01:11:25.166,01:11:27.875,These clients.
01:11:28.041,01:11:30.583,"Scotland, this fishing expedition."
01:11:30.750,01:11:32.916,"What kind of fishing trip, Jim?"
01:11:33.083,01:11:34.875,Salmon fishing.
01:11:35.458,01:11:37.375,Just tell me that you're not gonna be in any danger...
01:11:37.541,01:11:40.916,"that this is just a routine business trip, and I won't worry."
01:11:41.416,01:11:43.166,I need my passport.
01:11:47.833,01:11:49.375,Just give me something to hold on to.
01:11:49.458,01:11:51.916,I don't even care if it's the truth.
01:11:53.250,01:11:55.000,I'm doing this for us.
01:12:18.333,01:12:20.416,"HOFFMAN: Mr. Michener, here, is your Berlin escort."
01:12:20.583,01:12:23.083,He's an attache with the U.S. embassy.
01:12:23.250,01:12:25.541,"So, it's gotten goddamn complicated."
01:12:25.708,01:12:27.750,"As you know, the last letter from Mrs. Abel, whoever she is..."
01:12:27.875,01:12:30.250,"talks about a lawyer in East Berlin, Mr. Vogel, whoever he is..."
01:12:30.375,01:12:31.666,"representing her interests, she says."
01:12:31.750,01:12:35.000,"Yeah, Vogel says he's gone to the Russian embassy in East Berlin..."
01:12:35.166,01:12:37.916,and they may be ready to trade Abel for Powers.
01:12:38.083,01:12:40.833,"But no one knows who's who, but essentially they're all Russian, right?"
01:12:41.000,01:12:43.250,"Well, Soviet."
01:12:43.416,01:12:46.250,What do you mean?
01:12:48.833,01:12:50.416,There's a wrinkle.
01:12:50.583,01:12:52.291,They might try to throw you a curveball.
01:12:52.458,01:12:55.416,Try and get you to accept another prisoner other than Powers.
01:12:55.583,01:12:57.041,Another American?
01:12:57.250,01:13:00.250,The East German Stasi picked up an American student.
01:13:00.375,01:13:01.583,Frederic Pryor.
01:13:02.291,01:13:04.000,Kid they found on the wrong side of the Wall.
01:13:04.083,01:13:07.458,"He's a grad student out of Yale, came over here to study economics."
01:13:07.625,01:13:11.458,"So, they're making noises about trying this kid for espionage."
01:13:11.625,01:13:14.291,"Grave offense, capital crime."
01:13:14.458,01:13:18.750,"Vogel got in touch with us, said he represents Pryor."
01:13:18.916,01:13:24.125,Wait a minute.
01:13:24.333,01:13:25.916,"Yeah, he's busy."
01:13:26.583,01:13:27.666,"So, what is he?"
01:13:27.833,01:13:30.500,"Vogel, is he East German or is he Russian?"
01:13:30.666,01:13:32.583,Try to figure it out when you meet him.
01:13:32.750,01:13:35.250,"Russian embassy, East Berlin, noon tomorrow."
01:13:35.416,01:13:37.583,Hoffman will show you how to get there.
01:13:37.750,01:13:40.583,Show me how to get there?
01:13:40.750,01:13:41.750,Right?
01:13:42.166,01:13:44.083,"That was the plan but like I said, there's a wrinkle."
01:13:44.250,01:13:46.416,I won't be taking you.
01:13:46.583,01:13:49.333,No U.S. government personnel are to cross the border until further notice.
01:13:49.500,01:13:50.916,How come?
01:13:51.083,01:13:52.500,The East Germans grabbed this kid.
01:13:52.666,01:13:56.000,There's a degree of impunity that we had not anticipated.
01:13:56.166,01:13:59.750,The point is that the East German agenda and the Russian agenda...
01:13:59.916,01:14:01.250,may not be the same thing.
01:14:01.416,01:14:03.208,Try and figure it out and act accordingly.
01:14:03.291,01:14:05.208,Try to make a deal.
01:14:05.375,01:14:08.166,"What about this college kid, Pryor?"
01:14:08.250,01:14:10.416,Mmm-mmm.
01:14:10.583,01:14:11.916,We can get him out another time.
01:14:12.000,01:14:13.500,Powers is the whole ball game.
01:14:36.291,01:14:37.958,Where's your room?
01:14:38.708,01:14:40.916,I'll be staying at the Hilton.
01:14:42.291,01:14:43.958,It's not far.
01:14:45.458,01:14:47.875,This is a number here in West Berlin.
01:14:48.041,01:14:49.666,Memorize it and give it back to me.
01:14:50.958,01:14:52.916,"No. I mean, now."
01:14:54.708,01:14:59.125,The Soviets keep cutting the international lines but local calls are okay.
01:14:59.291,01:15:01.541,Someone will pick up day and night.
01:15:09.708,01:15:12.208,"Now, this docket attached to your passport..."
01:15:12.375,01:15:16.083,will serve as your ticket into and out of the Eastern Soviet sector.
01:15:17.000,01:15:19.250,The meeting with Vogel is set for noon tomorrow.
01:15:25.708,01:15:27.250,There are only a few routes left to the East.
01:15:27.416,01:15:29.708,"You take the S-Bahn, the station we showed you on the way in."
01:15:29.875,01:15:32.250,You're gonna get off at the Friedrichstrasse station here...
01:15:32.416,01:15:35.375,and walk to the Soviet embassy on Unter den Linden here.
01:15:35.541,01:15:37.666,Look at the map now.
01:15:37.875,01:15:40.083,"You're looking at a map, you're an American, you're a spy."
01:15:40.250,01:15:42.041,You could well be detained.
01:15:42.208,01:15:44.250,Just avoid interacting with people generally.
01:15:44.333,01:15:46.583,"You don't belong, so don't stick out."
01:15:47.083,01:15:49.416,Food is scarce over there and things have started to fall apart.
01:15:49.583,01:15:53.625,"There are gangs, and rule of law is less firmly established over there."
01:15:53.791,01:15:55.625,And definitely stay away from the Wall.
01:15:55.791,01:15:58.166,"On their side, there's a line cleared of buildings along the Wall."
01:15:58.250,01:15:59.708,They call it the Death Line.
01:15:59.791,01:16:01.083,Cross it and you'll be shot.
01:16:01.250,01:16:04.250,Is there any outcome here where I'm not either detained or shot?
01:16:04.416,01:16:06.541,Don't worry too much about what Michener said.
01:16:06.708,01:16:08.916,"No, I'm worried about what you're saying."
01:16:09.083,01:16:12.625,"This kid, Pryor, that the East Germans have, how old is he?"
01:16:12.791,01:16:14.583,25. Why?
01:16:14.750,01:16:16.416,Same age as Dougie.
01:16:18.416,01:16:19.791,Who?
01:16:19.958,01:16:21.583,"Uh, an associate of mine."
01:16:23.583,01:16:25.666,Frederic Pryor.
01:18:02.250,01:18:03.375,"Okay, okay."
01:19:49.250,01:19:55.208,"So, we apologize if this offends."
01:20:00.458,01:20:01.583,Uh...
01:20:01.708,01:20:02.708,Coat?
01:20:21.916,01:20:23.583,Okay. Um...
01:21:15.708,01:21:17.500,Do you understand English?
01:21:17.666,01:21:18.916,"Yes, sir."
01:21:19.000,01:21:21.208,I'm James Donovan.
01:21:21.291,01:21:22.291,Mr. Vogel.
01:21:22.416,01:21:23.375,He doesn't work here.
01:21:23.458,01:21:25.125,I'm just supposed to meet him.
01:21:51.166,01:21:52.750,So we finally meet you.
01:21:54.750,01:21:55.916,I'm Helen Abel.
01:21:56.083,01:21:57.791,How is our husband?
01:21:57.958,01:21:59.083,How is my Rudolf?
01:21:59.250,01:22:01.000,As good as can be expected.
01:22:01.166,01:22:03.500,"And we will get him back, yes?"
01:22:03.666,01:22:05.000,This is our daughter.
01:22:05.166,01:22:06.333,How do you do?
01:22:06.500,01:22:07.500,Lydia.
01:22:08.041,01:22:09.666,Are you Mr. Vogel?
01:22:12.083,01:22:13.500,I'm not Vogel.
01:22:13.666,01:22:15.083,I'm Cousin Drews.
01:22:16.500,01:22:18.416,This is Rudolf's beloved Cousin Drews.
01:22:18.583,01:22:19.583,"Yes, Cousin Drews."
01:22:19.750,01:22:20.875,I am Cousin Drews.
01:22:21.000,01:22:22.458,"Cousin Drews, yes."
01:22:22.666,01:22:23.916,I'm Helen Abel.
01:22:27.708,01:22:29.583,When will you see him?
01:22:30.208,01:22:32.416,When will your government release him?
01:22:32.583,01:22:36.250,I'm a little lost here.
01:22:36.416,01:22:38.500,"BOTH: Oh, Mr. Vogel is our lawyer."
01:22:38.666,01:22:42.333,We were supposed to negotiate the exchange.
01:22:42.500,01:22:43.500,To bring Rudolf here?
01:22:43.666,01:22:45.083,"Yes, yes, to bring him here."
01:22:45.250,01:22:47.875,"But it doesn't happen unilaterally, do you understand?"
01:22:48.041,01:22:50.583,It has to be an exchange.
01:22:53.416,01:22:54.916,Not here?
01:23:14.916,01:23:16.458,Mr. Donovan?
01:23:16.625,01:23:17.750,Mr. Vogel.
01:23:17.916,01:23:19.416,"No, no, no. Goodness."
01:23:19.583,01:23:21.625,My name is Schischkin.
01:23:21.791,01:23:24.916,I'm the second secretary of the Soviet embassy.
01:23:25.083,01:23:28.166,It wouldn't be appropriate for Mr. Vogel to join us.
01:23:28.333,01:23:30.500,He is a German national.
01:23:30.666,01:23:32.750,So you aren't here to...
01:23:32.916,01:23:36.125,To facilitate this meeting.
01:23:36.333,01:23:41.458,"Uh, perhaps Mrs. Abel would like to compose herself privately?"
01:23:41.666,01:23:45.250,And let Mr. Donovan and myself to talk?
01:23:46.916,01:23:48.416,Thank you.
01:23:57.500,01:23:59.458,"So, I'm confused."
01:23:59.583,01:24:00.541,Yes.
01:24:00.625,01:24:05.083,I don't care who I talk to if it's about an exchange of personnel.
01:24:05.250,01:24:07.208,Are you the person to talk to?
01:24:07.375,01:24:10.416,"Yes, yes, yes, of course."
01:24:10.583,01:24:13.833,"Uh, please, have a seat, Mr. Donovan."
01:24:13.916,01:24:16.208,"Uh, how did you arrive to the Eastern sector?"
01:24:16.375,01:24:17.625,The train. The S-Bahn.
01:24:17.791,01:24:19.416,And you were alone?
01:24:19.583,01:24:20.791,Yeah.
01:24:20.958,01:24:24.083,And you are credentialed?
01:24:24.250,01:24:27.833,"You must know about me, sir."
01:24:27.958,01:24:29.916,I'm a lawyer in Brooklyn in the United States...
01:24:30.083,01:24:34.916,"and I've taken time out of my busy schedule to help my client, Rudolf Abel."
01:24:35.083,01:24:39.166,I'm authorized to arrange an exchange of Abel...
01:24:39.333,01:24:41.791,for Francis Gary Powers.
01:24:41.958,01:24:44.583,This is a full pardon of Abel...
01:24:44.750,01:24:47.708,that will be signed when the exchange actually takes place.
01:24:48.125,01:24:49.583,This is the only reason I'm here.
01:24:49.750,01:24:52.916,I hope and expect to make this arrangement quickly.
01:24:53.625,01:24:56.500,Abel for Francis Gary Powers...
01:24:57.625,01:24:59.791,and Frederic Pryor.
01:25:01.583,01:25:03.666,"Oh, we don't have Pryor."
01:25:03.833,01:25:06.041,No? You don't?
01:25:07.833,01:25:09.250,I've heard of Pryor...
01:25:09.416,01:25:13.500,but he's held by the German Democratic Republic...
01:25:13.666,01:25:17.500,not by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
01:25:17.666,01:25:19.875,I'll tell you the first problem.
01:25:20.375,01:25:23.208,The names of your countries are too long.
01:25:25.166,01:25:26.375,"Yes, yes."
01:25:27.833,01:25:29.750,If we release Powers...
01:25:29.916,01:25:33.416,it is only to promote a goodwill between our countries.
01:25:34.416,01:25:37.666,"So, it cannot be an exchange."
01:25:40.625,01:25:44.541,Perhaps... Perhaps you could release Abel...
01:25:44.708,01:25:46.791,as a token of goodwill to our friends in Germany...
01:25:46.958,01:25:51.583,"and then, some months later, we would release Powers."
01:25:51.750,01:25:52.916,There is an idea.
01:25:53.083,01:25:54.291,No. That just won't work for us at all.
01:25:54.416,01:25:56.875,We need this to be an exchange.
01:25:57.041,01:25:59.041,You can call it what you want...
01:25:59.208,01:26:00.375,but an exchange it must be.
01:26:00.541,01:26:02.416,We can have Abel here within 48 hours.
01:26:03.375,01:26:07.291,We need Powers at the same time we give you Abel.
01:26:09.083,01:26:11.583,Hmm. This is...
01:26:11.750,01:26:15.416,Can we call this the impatient plan?
01:26:15.583,01:26:17.750,You can call it whatever you want.
01:26:19.750,01:26:23.708,"I can relay your impatient plan to Moscow, see what they say..."
01:26:23.791,01:26:27.333,but they will wonder why so impatient.
01:26:28.166,01:26:29.916,Because I have a cold.
01:26:30.083,01:26:32.125,And I don't live in Berlin and I want to go home.
01:26:32.666,01:26:33.916,They will think...
01:26:34.083,01:26:39.583,"Well, the Americans must have gotten all the information that Abel had to give."
01:26:39.750,01:26:43.250,And now they're impatient to trade him...
01:26:43.416,01:26:46.500,"hoping to get in return this man, Powers..."
01:26:46.666,01:26:50.958,"that, perhaps, has not yet given up all the information that he has to give."
01:26:52.416,01:26:55.625,"This is not an equitable trade, sir."
01:26:56.208,01:26:59.791,"But what you're saying is, if Powers has given up everything he knows..."
01:26:59.958,01:27:01.916,then Moscow would trade?
01:27:02.083,01:27:03.708,Why wouldn't they?
01:27:04.500,01:27:07.625,"As for Abel, if he dies in an American prison..."
01:27:07.791,01:27:12.250,the next Russian operative who gets caught might think twice about keeping his mouth shut.
01:27:12.416,01:27:16.750,And you never know.
01:27:17.833,01:27:21.791,and decide to trade Russian secrets for small American favors.
01:27:24.041,01:27:27.000,How can we know this?
01:27:27.166,01:27:30.458,"We little men, we just do our jobs."
01:27:30.625,01:27:33.708,Like Lieutenant Powers.
01:27:35.791,01:27:41.250,"He was making photographs from 70,000 feet when he was shot from the sky."
01:27:41.666,01:27:46.333,People in my country consider this an act of war.
01:27:48.125,01:27:50.833,"We have to get off this merry-go-round, sir."
01:27:51.000,01:27:54.708,The next mistake our countries make could be the last one.
01:27:55.416,01:27:59.916,We need to have the conversation our governments can't.
01:28:04.916,01:28:07.000,I will ask Moscow.
01:28:07.416,01:28:10.333,Who knows what they will say.
01:28:11.250,01:28:17.750,"There are a lot of people, Mr. Donovan, who doesn't want this exchange to ever take place."
01:28:19.875,01:28:21.541,Can you come back tomorrow...
01:28:21.708,01:28:23.250,to discuss their answer?
01:28:23.416,01:28:24.541,Powers for Abel.
01:28:24.708,01:28:26.125,And Frederic Pryor.
01:28:26.291,01:28:30.375,"As I said, Pryor is in the hands of the organs of State Security..."
01:28:30.541,01:28:32.041,of the German Democratic Republic.
01:28:32.208,01:28:34.458,I'm confident you can make arrangements.
01:28:35.083,01:28:38.750,I am merely a secretary in the embassy of foreign power.
01:28:38.916,01:28:39.958,"Okay, okay."
01:28:40.083,01:28:43.708,You have to see Mr. Vogel.
01:28:43.875,01:28:45.708,There actually is a Mr. Vogel?
01:28:45.875,01:28:48.083,Why would you imagine otherwise?
01:28:48.208,01:28:50.708,"Uh, it's a short cab ride."
01:28:51.125,01:28:56.583,"And please, Mr. Donovan, wear an overcoat in this weather."
01:28:57.250,01:28:59.333,I had mine stolen from me.
01:29:00.166,01:29:04.250,What do you expect?
01:29:05.083,01:29:06.333,Wasn't it?
01:29:14.750,01:29:15.916,VOGEL: Mr. Donovan.
01:29:16.000,01:29:17.500,Mr. Vogel.
01:29:17.625,01:29:19.208,Please come in.
01:29:19.416,01:29:20.750,Danke.
01:29:24.000,01:29:26.250,Sorry about the embassy.
01:29:27.666,01:29:30.416,But the Soviets decided not to host me.
01:29:31.750,01:29:33.250,Very irritating.
01:29:33.416,01:29:36.791,I am still trying to grasp each party's...
01:29:36.958,01:29:38.000,Status?
01:29:38.416,01:29:42.375,Yes. And interest in the proceedings.
01:29:42.750,01:29:44.875,It's a new world.
01:29:45.041,01:29:47.291,"All very disorienting, isn't it?"
01:29:57.291,01:29:59.458,Let me tell you what I have to offer.
01:30:01.833,01:30:03.375,I'm a good friend...
01:30:03.541,01:30:05.583,"Friend. No, he's older."
01:30:05.750,01:30:07.125,Protege?
01:30:07.291,01:30:10.125,Of the attorney general of the German Democratic Republic.
01:30:10.291,01:30:11.583,"Sit down, please."
01:30:14.666,01:30:16.500,This unfortunate...
01:30:16.666,01:30:18.666,Frederic Pryor...
01:30:18.833,01:30:21.583,he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
01:30:21.750,01:30:27.500,"But every accident, properly viewed, is an opportunity, isn't it, Mr. Donovan?"
01:30:27.583,01:30:30.250,Well...
01:30:27.583,01:30:32.458,Your country refuses to recognize the German Democratic Republic.
01:30:32.625,01:30:36.583,"They prefer to make up stories that the GDR doesn't exist, for instance."
01:30:38.833,01:30:40.333,Sorry.
01:30:40.833,01:30:45.833,"As a means of forcing your government's recognition of this real place, sir..."
01:30:46.000,01:30:49.083,"in which you find yourself, the GDR..."
01:30:49.250,01:30:54.000,the attorney general is happy to negotiate with you as a representative of your government...
01:30:54.166,01:30:55.333,for Mr. Pryor's return.
01:30:55.500,01:30:59.083,"Mr. Vogel, I'm not here as a representative of my government."
01:31:02.083,01:31:03.250,All right.
01:31:06.041,01:31:08.250,"I think that's childish, Mr. Donovan."
01:31:08.416,01:31:10.875,"Well, I..."
01:31:11.041,01:31:12.041,Fine.
01:31:12.125,01:31:15.250,"You do not represent the USA, I do not represent the GDR."
01:31:15.416,01:31:17.583,"My client is Lydia Abel, Rudolf's wife."
01:31:17.750,01:31:18.750,And I have also...
01:31:18.916,01:31:21.541,Lydia is the daughter.
01:31:26.958,01:31:28.083,Well...
01:31:29.708,01:31:34.291,I am prepared to offer Frederic Pryor's exchange for Rudolf Abel's.
01:31:35.916,01:31:39.083,Then let's be clear.
01:31:39.250,01:31:43.125,"You will produce, at the same time, the student, Pryor."
01:31:43.250,01:31:44.583,At the same time?
01:31:44.750,01:31:46.250,Absolutely.
01:31:46.416,01:31:51.416,The exchange on offer is a Russian at the end of his life...
01:31:53.166,01:31:56.583,for an American student at the start of his.
01:32:02.708,01:32:05.458,Schischkin? He's not an embassy secretary.
01:32:05.625,01:32:09.250,Ivan Schischkin is the KGB's chief in western Europe.
01:32:09.333,01:32:13.250,"Well, whatever he is, he's relaying our proposal to Moscow..."
01:32:14.750,01:32:16.041,and they'll decide.
01:32:16.208,01:32:18.875,Could I borrow a coat?
01:32:19.041,01:32:20.583,How did you lose your coat?
01:32:20.750,01:32:22.791,"You know, spy stuff."
01:32:24.375,01:32:25.416,I'll get you another coat.
01:32:25.583,01:32:27.250,"Good, because..."
01:32:27.708,01:32:30.333,So who is this Vogel?
01:32:31.041,01:32:32.500,"Him, we don't know."
01:32:32.666,01:32:34.916,He might be what you said he said he is.
01:32:35.041,01:32:36.291,Friend of the attorney general.
01:32:36.500,01:32:39.833,Just some guy the GDR tapped to handle this.
01:32:40.000,01:32:44.416,Sounds like the East Germans are fighting for a place at our table.
01:32:44.583,01:32:48.916,"The GDR gets Abel back for the Russians, winning their respect..."
01:32:49.083,01:32:51.291,and capturing the headlines for their cause.
01:32:51.416,01:32:53.458,"Which, of course, puts East Germany on the map."
01:32:54.041,01:32:56.625,But we don't care about their map.
01:32:56.791,01:32:58.375,Stick with the Russians.
01:32:58.541,01:33:00.666,Stick with the Russians.
01:33:00.833,01:33:03.625,"So, does all this mean this might actually happen?"
01:33:04.208,01:33:06.000,"HOFFMAN: Yeah, that's what you seem to be telling me."
01:33:06.166,01:33:08.958,"We'll put Abel on a plane, he'll be here Friday."
01:33:09.125,01:33:13.416,"So, if Schischkin gets the okay, all that's left is the mechanics of the trade."
01:33:13.541,01:33:15.208,How we swap our guy for their guy.
01:33:15.375,01:33:19.250,Our guys. Two guys.
01:33:19.708,01:33:22.458,"No, now don't go bleeding heart on me."
01:33:22.625,01:33:25.083,Powers is the whole ball game.
01:33:25.208,01:33:28.791,"Forget this Ivy League boy, who obviously thought it was a good idea..."
01:33:28.916,01:33:33.583,to study Soviet economics in Berlin in the middle of the Cold War.
01:33:34.750,01:33:37.208,Powers is who we need.
01:33:37.375,01:33:39.750,You don't even like Powers.
01:33:40.416,01:33:42.583,Everybody hates Powers.
01:33:42.750,01:33:46.500,He didn't kill himself and he let the commies parade him on television.
01:33:47.333,01:33:49.541,He's the most hated man in America.
01:33:49.708,01:33:52.333,"After Rudolf Abel, maybe."
01:33:52.708,01:33:54.083,And me.
01:34:02.916,01:34:03.958,Now wake up!
01:34:13.041,01:34:14.875,I gotta sleep.
01:34:15.041,01:34:16.291,I just gotta sleep.
01:34:19.916,01:34:23.041,"I told you, you can sleep once we talk what we need to talk."
01:34:23.208,01:34:25.625,You must focus on me.
01:34:25.791,01:34:28.291,Your government doesn't care about you.
01:34:28.458,01:34:29.500,Any of you.
01:34:29.666,01:34:33.166,You know that twelve U-2 pilots incurred brain damage?
01:34:33.333,01:34:36.541,"They're vegetables because of altitude, insufficient oxygen."
01:34:36.708,01:34:40.166,"But they keep you flying, Gary."
01:34:41.000,01:34:44.375,They gave you this.
01:34:44.833,01:34:46.375,Potassium cyanide.
01:34:47.458,01:34:50.500,Does that look like they care about you?
01:35:20.000,01:35:22.416,What is the construction of the destructor unit?
01:35:22.583,01:35:24.875,By what means is this unit operated?
01:35:25.041,01:35:30.125,"With what explosives is the unit charged, and what destruction is it capable of?"
01:35:30.708,01:35:32.375,I don't know.
01:35:32.541,01:35:34.750,The pilots were never shown any of the equipment.
01:35:34.916,01:35:38.875,How wide far can the radar map an area during an overflight?
01:35:39.083,01:35:40.375,"I don't know, I don't know!"
01:35:41.041,01:35:44.083,Were you making the overflight on April 9th...
01:35:44.250,01:35:48.041,over the industrial area and MiG bomber base at Baranovichi?
01:35:48.208,01:35:51.583,I was not. This was my first overflight.
01:35:51.750,01:35:55.250,I need to know about engine-out to glide ratio.
01:35:55.416,01:35:57.708,How the plane gets so high.
01:35:58.500,01:36:03.166,"We know it reaches altitude of 70,000 feet."
01:36:03.333,01:36:05.291,"Gary, we know this."
01:36:05.458,01:36:07.791,And I need to know where the planes have flown.
01:36:07.958,01:36:10.458,"Where they have flown, Gary."
01:36:10.625,01:36:13.041,And we must have this talk now.
01:36:15.500,01:36:16.500,Now.
01:36:17.458,01:36:20.083,And then you can sleep a little.
01:36:24.208,01:36:25.958,"MICHAEL: Sir, wake up."
01:36:27.541,01:36:28.750,"Wake up, sir."
01:36:30.958,01:36:33.208,"Sir, can you come with me, please?"
01:36:33.375,01:36:35.083,We gotta move.
01:36:35.250,01:36:36.958,"Can you come with me, please?"
01:36:37.125,01:36:38.416,Okay.
01:36:39.125,01:36:40.708,Got your glasses?
01:36:40.833,01:36:41.833,What time is it?
01:36:41.916,01:36:43.750,"It's late, but we need to talk..."
01:36:44.041,01:36:45.958,"and then we need to get on a plane, okay?"
01:36:47.125,01:36:49.291,Yeah.
01:36:49.458,01:36:51.125,Upsy-daisy.
01:36:51.291,01:36:52.916,There we go. Keep it moving.
01:36:53.083,01:36:54.250,Thank you.
01:36:56.000,01:36:57.708,"Other way, other way."
01:36:57.791,01:36:58.916,There we go.
01:36:59.083,01:37:00.333,You say a plane?
01:37:00.500,01:37:01.958,"This way, please."
01:37:02.125,01:37:07.250,"SCHISCHKIN: So, I received a favorable decision from Moscow on your proposal..."
01:37:07.458,01:37:10.583,that we help our friends in the German Democratic Republic...
01:37:10.750,01:37:14.833,by exchanging Mr. Powers for Mr. Abel.
01:37:16.458,01:37:17.791,That's swell.
01:37:17.958,01:37:21.625,May I suggest the Glienicke Bridge as a place of a swap?
01:37:22.208,01:37:23.833,Why not Checkpoint Charlie?
01:37:24.541,01:37:26.041,We're not looking for publicity.
01:37:26.208,01:37:29.416,"The Glienicke Bridge is very quiet, especially early in the morning."
01:37:29.625,01:37:32.083,Glienicke Bridge.
01:37:32.250,01:37:35.583,We can have Abel here on Friday.
01:37:35.708,01:37:37.416,"Always impatience, yeah?"
01:37:37.583,01:37:41.250,I want to get home and get into bed.
01:37:41.625,01:37:43.125,5:30?
01:37:43.291,01:37:45.750,All right. We're done here.
01:37:46.583,01:37:50.958,"This is a number, in case anything should come up."
01:37:51.125,01:37:52.125,All right.
01:37:52.291,01:37:54.708,Someone will answer at any hour.
01:37:55.333,01:37:57.708,I don't expect to use it.
01:37:58.208,01:38:00.916,Shall we toast the arrangement?
01:38:01.208,01:38:02.708,Why not?
01:38:03.791,01:38:06.083,Armenian brandy.
01:38:06.250,01:38:07.375,Thank you.
01:38:08.291,01:38:09.541,Would you mind...
01:38:09.708,01:38:13.541,This is not part of our business but I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
01:38:13.708,01:38:14.916,You do not have to answer.
01:38:15.083,01:38:17.500,I shall answer what I know.
01:38:17.708,01:38:20.375,"I like this guy, your guy."
01:38:20.541,01:38:23.541,What happens to your guy when he gets home?
01:38:23.708,01:38:28.291,We have to make a determination whether our guy is now your guy.
01:38:28.458,01:38:31.166,"Now, as I said to you before, he's acted honorably."
01:38:31.333,01:38:32.916,"He's still your guy, believe me."
01:38:33.083,01:38:36.083,Of course you will say that if it were true...
01:38:36.250,01:38:38.333,and if it were not true.
01:38:38.500,01:38:40.750,"I guess it has come down to that, huh?"
01:38:40.916,01:38:43.708,Forgive me for pushing...
01:38:43.875,01:38:47.666,but is he in any danger if the determination is made?
01:38:47.833,01:38:49.750,"Well, goodness."
01:38:49.916,01:38:52.916,"As things are now, everyone is in danger."
01:38:53.083,01:38:54.083,Cheers.
01:38:54.208,01:38:55.833,Na zdorovie.
01:39:08.208,01:39:10.583,There will be no exchange on Glienicke Bridge.
01:39:11.583,01:39:13.500,"Excuse me, sir."
01:39:13.666,01:39:15.750,There will be no exchange.
01:39:16.375,01:39:18.041,Not for Frederic Pryor.
01:39:18.208,01:39:21.166,"Mr. Vogel, I thought yesterday we had agreed."
01:39:21.333,01:39:24.041,"We agreed on an exchange, Abel for Pryor."
01:39:25.250,01:39:28.416,Now I learn you are a rug merchant...
01:39:28.583,01:39:31.208,selling the same rug to two customers.
01:39:31.375,01:39:33.208,Abel for Pryor you sell to us.
01:39:33.375,01:39:34.375,Yeah.
01:39:34.791,01:39:36.583,And Abel for Powers you sell to the Soviets.
01:39:36.750,01:39:39.041,I'm not quite sure what the problem is...
01:39:39.125,01:39:42.208,if the arrangement satisfies two parties or three or four.
01:39:42.375,01:39:43.625,What difference does it make?
01:39:43.791,01:39:46.083,The arrangement does not satisfy this party.
01:39:50.333,01:39:51.750,"Now, Mr. Vogel..."
01:39:51.916,01:39:54.875,Obviously you do not know who you are dealing with.
01:39:56.500,01:39:59.625,Here's the interest of the German Democratic Republic.
01:40:00.625,01:40:04.625,"To deal with, and to be seen to be dealing with another sovereign power..."
01:40:04.791,01:40:06.291,the United States.
01:40:06.458,01:40:08.333,An equal power.
01:40:08.500,01:40:11.625,Instead you treat us as stooges for the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
01:40:11.791,01:40:14.458,Can we just call them the Russians?
01:40:15.875,01:40:19.166,"I have an appointment, sir."
01:40:19.333,01:40:21.458,"Now, tell me if I am describing this wrong."
01:40:21.625,01:40:23.166,"You have a kid, a university student..."
01:40:23.333,01:40:26.000,"someone you know is not a spy, who's no threat to you."
01:40:26.166,01:40:29.250,And in exchange for this person who is worthless to you...
01:40:29.416,01:40:33.250,you play an equal part in an exchange between the Russians and the Americans.
01:40:34.250,01:40:38.041,And this is one transaction between us and the two of you.
01:40:38.125,01:40:40.541,"We're not trying to do two things here, sir."
01:40:40.625,01:40:41.625,"One, one, one."
01:40:41.833,01:40:46.541,It's hard for me to see how the Republic of East German Democrats is being slighted.
01:40:46.708,01:40:49.416,You agreed to the Soviets without consulting me.
01:40:49.583,01:40:51.291,Is this a negotiation or a conspiracy?
01:40:51.458,01:40:53.791,"For it to be a conspiracy, there would have to be harm to you, sir."
01:40:53.958,01:40:56.666,There's just benefits here.
01:40:56.833,01:40:59.083,"No, you decide they agree."
01:40:59.625,01:41:01.083,"Where is your appointment, sir?"
01:41:01.250,01:41:02.791,In the West. Ku'damm.
01:41:02.958,01:41:03.958,Good.
01:41:14.833,01:41:16.083,VOGEL: Look around you.
01:41:16.250,01:41:19.416,"How does the Eastern sector compare with the West, hmm?"
01:41:21.375,01:41:26.000,Our Russian friends have decided that we should not rebuild our capital city.
01:41:27.583,01:41:31.083,But we live in this ruin made by our Russian friends.
01:41:31.250,01:41:33.375,"Go ahead, make your deal with these Russians."
01:41:33.541,01:41:34.708,We won't be part of it.
01:41:37.041,01:41:39.041,There is no deal without Pryor.
01:41:39.208,01:41:40.750,Is this your position or your government's?
01:41:41.041,01:41:44.625,"Sir, I'm here."
01:41:44.791,01:41:46.750,But you are not a representative of your government.
01:41:46.916,01:41:48.750,You don't know who you are.
01:41:49.125,01:41:52.125,You should be careful.
01:41:59.416,01:42:00.833,"Look, sir."
01:42:01.000,01:42:04.833,"You must know that in every respect that matters, I represent my government."
01:42:04.958,01:42:06.458,You know who I am.
01:42:07.416,01:42:08.583,Do I?
01:42:15.041,01:42:16.250,Uh-oh.
01:42:30.666,01:42:33.083,Do you have the proper papers?
01:42:33.500,01:42:35.875,Of course not.
01:42:36.333,01:42:39.250,An American lawyer like you can talk your way out of anything.
01:42:39.416,01:42:40.958,Can't you?
01:43:23.375,01:43:24.958,You go with him.
01:43:25.125,01:43:26.166,Why?
01:43:26.250,01:43:28.083,It's passport problem.
01:43:28.250,01:43:29.583,What problem?
01:43:29.750,01:43:31.000,You go with him.
01:43:33.750,01:43:35.083,And remember...
01:43:35.250,01:43:38.125,we control the fate of Frederic Pryor.
01:45:21.666,01:45:23.041,My God!
01:45:58.333,01:46:00.583,"with some coffee, please."
01:46:00.750,01:46:03.166,Then I'll have the Hilton combo...
01:46:03.333,01:46:04.750,and the American breakfast.
01:46:04.875,01:46:06.083,And coffee.
01:46:06.250,01:46:07.416,Both breakfasts?
01:46:07.583,01:46:08.625,"Yeah, yeah."
01:46:08.750,01:46:09.750,One first or...
01:46:09.916,01:46:11.541,"Both first, both."
01:46:11.708,01:46:13.333,And coffee.
01:46:31.375,01:46:33.083,You shouldn't be here.
01:46:33.250,01:46:36.791,"Sometimes in Germany, you just want a big American breakfast."
01:46:40.250,01:46:41.791,What happened?
01:46:42.291,01:46:45.416,Vogel arranged for me to spend some time in the East.
01:46:45.583,01:46:46.625,"Oh, Jesus."
01:46:46.791,01:46:50.750,"Frankly, it's not that much worse than where you have me here in the West."
01:46:52.250,01:46:55.250,So the Russians are fine with the exchange...
01:46:55.416,01:46:58.416,but now Vogel is saying that the East Germans won't do it.
01:46:58.583,01:46:59.583,We're not gonna get Pryor.
01:47:00.500,01:47:02.416,"Great, good."
01:47:02.583,01:47:04.625,So the Soviets are set.
01:47:04.791,01:47:07.458,We get Powers. Well done.
01:47:08.250,01:47:09.833,"DONOVAN: No, the East Germans won't do it."
01:47:10.333,01:47:14.083,"We won't get Pryor, and that kid matters."
01:47:14.250,01:47:16.916,"Sure, that's why you tried."
01:47:17.083,01:47:18.958,"Abel's on his way, so we're all set for tomorrow morning."
01:47:19.125,01:47:21.541,Wait a minute.
01:47:21.708,01:47:23.833,We are not getting the kid.
01:47:23.958,01:47:26.208,"Yeah, I understand."
01:47:26.375,01:47:28.333,We can ignore the message we got this morning.
01:47:29.708,01:47:31.083,What message?
01:47:31.250,01:47:32.291,From the East Germans.
01:47:32.458,01:47:34.250,They called the number I gave you.
01:47:34.416,01:47:36.416,They said they wanted to speak to you today.
01:47:36.583,01:47:37.583,Vogel called?
01:47:37.750,01:47:38.750,"No, um..."
01:47:38.916,01:47:42.583,"Office of Harald Ott, East German attorney general."
01:47:42.750,01:47:44.333,Wanting what?
01:47:44.500,01:47:45.500,"Well, to talk to you."
01:47:46.250,01:47:48.000,"But it's okay, I can't ask you to go back there."
01:47:48.791,01:47:50.833,"Listen, you seem to be persona non grata to some elements..."
01:47:51.000,01:47:52.250,so we won't push our luck.
01:47:52.416,01:47:54.250,So he wants to see me.
01:47:54.416,01:47:55.458,What time?
01:47:56.291,01:47:58.333,"Oh, no, no. Now, listen."
01:47:59.875,01:48:01.791,You don't need to go.
01:48:01.958,01:48:03.416,"In fact, you can't go."
01:48:03.583,01:48:05.958,We're set with the Soviets.
01:48:06.125,01:48:07.208,I'm not gonna screw it up.
01:48:07.375,01:48:09.500,You're not going!
01:48:09.666,01:48:10.958,I ordered.
01:48:11.125,01:48:13.875,Enjoy your big American breakfast.
01:48:22.750,01:48:27.250,I thought it should be negotiated at the highest level as a courtesy to you.
01:48:27.416,01:48:29.166,"I thank you, sir."
01:48:31.125,01:48:34.250,I don't know how things became so confused.
01:48:34.375,01:48:37.083,"Well, I guess sometimes they just do."
01:48:41.375,01:48:42.791,For sake of clarity...
01:48:42.958,01:48:44.750,I say we are fully prepared...
01:48:44.916,01:48:49.875,"to exchange the so-called student, Pryor, for Rudolf Abel."
01:48:50.041,01:48:52.916,I understand from Mr. Vogel that Pryor is very important to you.
01:48:53.083,01:48:54.083,"Yes, but..."
01:48:54.208,01:48:57.291,"Ah, we'll do a memorandum to that effect."
01:48:58.250,01:49:00.250,"Oh, a memorandum."
01:49:00.416,01:49:04.875,"Certainly, we commit to a bi-lateral exchange."
01:49:05.208,01:49:08.833,"Yes, yes, sure."
01:49:09.583,01:49:14.208,My country also insists on Francis Gary Powers.
01:49:14.375,01:49:15.791,No!
01:49:20.583,01:49:24.041,This is how things became so confused.
01:49:24.208,01:49:26.583,Powers.
01:49:26.750,01:49:29.750,You want him back for punitive reasons?
01:49:29.916,01:49:33.291,"He has divulged what he will divulge, as no doubt Abel has also."
01:49:34.125,01:49:39.041,We are offering instead someone who you insist is innocent.
01:49:39.208,01:49:40.416,And this is right.
01:49:40.583,01:49:42.625,This is who you should retrieve.
01:49:42.791,01:49:44.833,The future.
01:49:48.875,01:49:50.500,Ott.
01:50:03.416,01:50:05.875,I'm sorry.
01:50:25.333,01:50:26.333,"I'm very sorry, sir."
01:50:26.500,01:50:29.958,The attorney general regrets that he had to leave on urgent business.
01:50:30.125,01:50:31.125,He left?
01:50:31.291,01:50:33.500,Yes. Many apologies.
01:50:33.666,01:50:35.625,I've been waiting for over an hour.
01:50:35.791,01:50:37.416,"Very sorry, sir."
01:50:39.541,01:50:40.958,Young man.
01:50:43.000,01:50:44.375,Come here.
01:50:45.708,01:50:47.666,It's all right. Come here.
01:50:52.958,01:50:55.666,Uh... Take a seat.
01:50:57.000,01:50:59.791,"Oh, come on, come on. Sit down."
01:51:03.333,01:51:05.416,Do you like your job here?
01:51:05.916,01:51:07.416,"It's a very good job, sir."
01:51:07.583,01:51:09.583,It must be.
01:51:09.750,01:51:10.791,"Oh, yes, sir."
01:51:10.958,01:51:12.916,"And important, too."
01:51:13.083,01:51:15.583,And your English is good.
01:51:16.041,01:51:18.916,"Yes, I hesitate to say it's excellent."
01:51:19.083,01:51:20.916,"Good, good, good."
01:51:21.083,01:51:23.750,"See, I just lost my negotiating partner..."
01:51:23.916,01:51:25.708,and I need somebody to talk to...
01:51:25.875,01:51:28.333,and you seem like a reasonable young man.
01:51:29.416,01:51:31.250,Can I talk to you?
01:51:34.041,01:51:35.250,It's all right.
01:51:36.041,01:51:37.041,It's all right.
01:51:39.208,01:51:42.250,I just need you to give a message to your boss.
01:51:43.750,01:51:46.083,"But it has to be very, very, very, very clear."
01:51:46.708,01:51:48.125,You understand?
01:51:49.208,01:51:52.250,"Yes, sir. But perhaps you should wait until he..."
01:51:52.416,01:51:56.250,"No, no. Thing is, I have this cold and I wanna get home..."
01:51:56.416,01:51:58.208,and get in bed.
01:52:00.041,01:52:01.416,Can you give him the message?
01:52:01.708,01:52:02.916,Certainly.
01:52:04.916,01:52:07.083,"Well, this is the message."
01:52:08.083,01:52:11.416,There is no deal for Abel unless we get Powers and Pryor.
01:52:12.416,01:52:13.750,Do you understand?
01:52:13.916,01:52:16.083,"Yes, sir."
01:52:16.166,01:52:18.791,It will not happen unless we get two men.
01:52:18.958,01:52:20.666,Those two men.
01:52:20.833,01:52:22.416,"Two, two, two."
01:52:22.750,01:52:24.625,If there is no deal...
01:52:25.250,01:52:27.416,your boss must tell the Soviets.
01:52:28.625,01:52:32.791,He has to tell the Soviets that they are not getting Rudolf Abel.
01:52:34.791,01:52:36.250,"Yes, sir."
01:52:39.333,01:52:40.541,"Oh, and tell him this."
01:52:42.250,01:52:45.000,"So far, Abel has been a good soldier..."
01:52:45.166,01:52:47.250,but he thinks he's going home.
01:52:49.333,01:52:51.833,If we had to tell him that he's not going home...
01:52:52.000,01:52:54.750,"that the Soviets don't even want him, that he's never going home..."
01:52:54.916,01:52:57.916,I imagine his behavior might change.
01:52:59.125,01:53:03.333,And who will be held responsible for that?
01:53:05.708,01:53:07.083,That's a long message.
01:53:07.500,01:53:09.125,"Uh, did you get it all?"
01:53:09.333,01:53:11.000,"Yes, sir. Got it."
01:53:11.166,01:53:12.333,Good.
01:53:13.000,01:53:14.750,You're a good man.
01:53:15.500,01:53:16.500,Oh.
01:53:17.125,01:53:18.250,And also tell him...
01:53:18.625,01:53:21.833,there's no deal unless we hear before the end of business today.
01:53:22.000,01:53:23.250,He has the number.
01:53:23.416,01:53:25.208,If the exchange isn't gonna happen...
01:53:25.375,01:53:27.708,no reason for everybody to get up first thing in the morning.
01:53:27.791,01:53:30.916,that would be pointless.
01:53:31.083,01:53:32.291,You're kidding me!
01:53:33.000,01:53:34.041,You're kidding me!
01:53:34.208,01:53:36.125,Not really.
01:53:36.291,01:53:38.625,This is exactly what you weren't supposed to do.
01:53:38.791,01:53:41.291,My instructions were to feel out the situation.
01:53:41.458,01:53:44.000,"Your instructions were to get Powers, not Pryor."
01:53:44.166,01:53:46.416,That was not the original deal.
01:53:46.583,01:53:49.166,How do you know?
01:53:49.333,01:53:50.583,You fucked it all up!
01:53:50.750,01:53:52.416,"Oh, don't worry."
01:53:52.583,01:53:54.416,I think it's gonna be fine.
01:53:54.583,01:53:56.458,How do you know?
01:54:00.208,01:54:02.583,United States.
01:54:02.750,01:54:04.250,Danke.
01:54:06.375,01:54:07.791,"Look, this whole thing..."
01:54:07.958,01:54:10.500,has been to feel me out.
01:54:10.666,01:54:14.083,Would I swap one for one and which one?
01:54:14.500,01:54:18.125,"But I said No, two for one."
01:54:18.291,01:54:20.291,"Yeah, what if they think about it and say..."
01:54:20.458,01:54:23.875,Forget it!
01:54:25.375,01:54:28.041,"Well, then I have fucked it all up."
01:54:28.208,01:54:30.208,"Hey, honey! It's me."
01:54:30.375,01:54:33.583,Yeah.
01:54:34.916,01:54:36.250,I'm in London...
01:54:36.416,01:54:39.083,"just for one more meeting, then I'm on my way home."
01:54:39.916,01:54:43.000,"Yeah, yeah, I remember that marmalade."
01:54:43.166,01:54:46.000,It's that shop right by Regent's Park.
01:54:46.875,01:54:48.708,"All right, I will if I have the time."
01:54:48.875,01:54:50.833,"Hey, can I say hi to Roger?"
01:54:51.750,01:54:54.041,Could I say hi to the girls?
01:54:54.208,01:54:56.250,Is anyone not busy?
01:54:56.750,01:54:59.416,Have they even noticed I'm not around?
01:55:55.291,01:55:56.708,We're on.
01:55:57.583,01:55:58.750,Two for one.
01:55:59.875,01:56:01.541,Hot dog.
01:56:02.208,01:56:04.083,Let's have a drink.
01:56:04.250,01:56:05.750,One wrinkle.
01:56:05.916,01:56:07.041,What is that?
01:56:07.166,01:56:09.791,"They won't release Pryor with Powers, not at the bridge."
01:56:09.958,01:56:11.208,They'll release him at the same time.
01:56:11.375,01:56:13.583,When the Russians give us Powers on the bridge...
01:56:13.750,01:56:15.291,they'll release Pryor over Checkpoint Charlie.
01:56:16.083,01:56:17.416,What does that mean?
01:56:17.916,01:56:21.833,"I think it means, We wanna have the last word."
01:56:22.000,01:56:23.500,But they will do it.
01:56:24.083,01:56:26.333,You tell me.
01:56:46.750,01:56:48.166,Where are they?
01:56:48.333,01:56:50.958,Where's our guy?
01:56:51.125,01:56:53.083,Nobody's late. We're early.
01:56:53.250,01:56:54.250,May I?
01:56:54.416,01:56:55.416,Yeah.
01:57:01.791,01:57:02.916,DONOVAN: Hoffman.
01:57:03.083,01:57:04.125,HOFFMAN: Yeah?
01:57:04.250,01:57:05.958,DONOVAN: I think they have...
01:57:06.125,01:57:07.333,What?
01:57:07.666,01:57:09.333,...snipers.
01:57:09.500,01:57:11.250,"Well, I'm sure they do."
01:57:11.625,01:57:13.250,How are you sure they do?
01:57:13.916,01:57:16.833,Because we have snipers.
01:57:33.458,01:57:34.875,"Step out, sir."
01:57:43.125,01:57:44.125,Jim.
01:57:48.750,01:57:49.916,Dear Jim.
01:57:51.750,01:57:54.041,How are you?
01:57:54.333,01:57:56.041,Happy to see you.
01:57:56.416,01:57:58.375,Have you arranged all this for me?
01:57:58.541,01:58:01.916,"Well, let's see what this is before I take credit for it."
01:58:02.416,01:58:05.333,Any word about Pryor from Checkpoint Charlie?
01:58:29.083,01:58:31.041,Nothing cooking yet.
01:58:37.166,01:58:38.541,"Excuse me, sir."
01:58:38.708,01:58:41.000,"This is Lieutenant Joe Murphy, United States Air Force..."
01:58:41.166,01:58:42.875,here to identify Powers.
01:58:43.583,01:58:44.583,Lieutenant Murphy.
01:58:45.250,01:58:46.416,Sir.
01:58:49.333,01:58:51.083,There may be a slight glitch.
01:58:51.250,01:58:53.333,I was a young man when I left.
01:58:53.500,01:58:55.916,Who will they find to identify me?
01:58:56.875,01:58:59.375,I hope it's not your East German family.
01:58:59.541,01:59:02.000,I doubt they could identify each other.
01:59:36.625,01:59:38.083,Looks like our party.
01:59:45.875,01:59:48.041,"Well, let's go."
01:59:48.208,01:59:50.000,"You can stay here, Donovan."
01:59:50.833,01:59:52.375,Not likely.
01:59:54.458,01:59:56.083,Open the gate.
02:00:10.458,02:00:12.833,What do you think will happen when you get home?
02:00:13.500,02:00:15.375,"Uh, I think..."
02:00:15.666,02:00:17.875,I'll have a vodka.
02:00:20.416,02:00:21.416,Yeah.
02:00:22.416,02:00:23.416,Yeah.
02:00:23.875,02:00:26.500,"But, Rudolf, is there not the possibility..."
02:00:26.666,02:00:29.541,That my people are going to shoot me?
02:00:29.916,02:00:31.208,Yes.
02:00:32.708,02:00:33.958,You're not worried?
02:00:34.125,02:00:35.666,Would it help?
02:00:47.083,02:00:49.625,"To answer your question, my friend..."
02:00:50.041,02:00:53.125,I acted honorably.
02:00:53.916,02:00:57.375,But sometimes people think wrong.
02:00:58.708,02:01:00.958,Let's see how they greet me.
02:01:02.000,02:01:03.833,What can I look for?
02:01:06.250,02:01:11.250,If I'm embraced or just shown the back seat.
02:01:50.791,02:01:52.041,ABEL: Da.
02:02:04.708,02:02:06.375,Take off the hat.
02:02:12.666,02:02:14.333,"Hey, Powers."
02:02:15.583,02:02:16.958,"Hey, Murph."
02:02:18.666,02:02:20.583,"Yeah, that's Powers."
02:02:22.666,02:02:25.291,"All right, Mr. Donovan."
02:02:25.625,02:02:26.958,Hang on.
02:02:33.583,02:02:35.916,"Believe me, I will tell you."
02:02:37.083,02:02:38.916,There's no one here.
02:02:41.833,02:02:44.166,They're releasing another man at Checkpoint Charlie.
02:02:44.333,02:02:46.291,We're just confirming that he's there.
02:02:46.458,02:02:47.708,SCHISCHKIN: Now!
02:02:47.875,02:02:50.208,"As per plan, if you please."
02:02:51.333,02:02:52.333,Let's go.
02:02:52.416,02:02:54.000,Pryor will show up or he won't.
02:02:54.083,02:02:55.083,Let's go.
02:02:55.250,02:02:57.708,They're waiting to see if we'll do it without him.
02:02:57.875,02:03:00.750,"We just have to stand here, show them we won't."
02:03:01.583,02:03:04.583,I don't give a shit what they want.
02:03:04.750,02:03:05.750,"Go ahead, Abel."
02:03:07.041,02:03:09.416,"HOFFMAN: Go ahead, sir."
02:03:09.875,02:03:11.958,"If it is not to plan, we go home."
02:03:12.166,02:03:14.416,We exchange now or we go home!
02:03:16.416,02:03:17.958,You're waiting for another man?
02:03:18.166,02:03:19.458,Yup.
02:03:20.000,02:03:21.916,"You want him, too."
02:03:23.583,02:03:24.666,I want him.
02:03:24.833,02:03:26.416,"Doesn't matter what he wants, sir."
02:03:26.500,02:03:28.458,I'm in charge and you are free to go.
02:03:28.583,02:03:29.583,Please go.
02:03:29.708,02:03:31.291,Walk across.
02:03:42.458,02:03:44.041,I can wait.
02:04:08.541,02:04:10.333,It's something.
02:04:10.500,02:04:12.083,I'm not sure yet.
02:04:13.541,02:04:14.708,Hang on!
02:05:06.916,02:05:08.291,We got him!
02:05:09.125,02:05:10.666,"Uh, I, uh..."
02:05:12.916,02:05:15.083,"I sent you a gift, Jim."
02:05:15.750,02:05:18.333,It's a... It's a painting.
02:05:18.875,02:05:21.708,I hope it has some meaning to you.
02:05:23.375,02:05:26.083,I'm sorry.
02:05:29.041,02:05:31.125,This is your gift.
02:05:34.250,02:05:36.416,This is your gift.
02:06:13.833,02:06:15.708,"Let's go, let's go, let's go!"
02:07:35.041,02:07:36.791,Mr. Donovan.
02:07:36.958,02:07:39.250,Colonel Abel asked me to give this to you.
02:07:42.375,02:07:43.583,"Pardon me, sir."
02:07:44.583,02:07:47.083,"Were you in charge of this thing, sir?"
02:07:47.583,02:07:48.583,Yeah.
