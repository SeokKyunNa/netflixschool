00:02:02.580,00:02:04.207,but I'm gonna kill myself.
00:02:06.251,00:02:08.128,I just thought that someone should know.
00:02:08.211,00:02:12.715,I don't really know how this works. I'm probably gonna jump off an overpass in front of a semi.
00:02:12.799,00:02:14.592,"So… Or a U-Haul maybe, just not a bus."
00:02:14.717,00:02:18.138,I'm not gonna be a dick and make people watch. But it has to be big.
00:02:18.221,00:02:21.975,It's gotta be so big that it just… Done. Kills me. Lights out.
00:02:22.058,00:02:26.813,"'Cause if it just maims me, and I'm like… then how's that good for anyone? Then I gotta find a nurse to smother me."
00:02:26.896,00:02:31.151,How am I gonna get across smothering if I'm… We don't need to get caught up in the minutiae.
00:02:31.234,00:02:34.070,"I just thought that an adult, you, should know."
00:02:36.948,00:02:43.037,"Wow. This is, uh, a lot to take in, Nadine."
00:02:43.288,00:02:45.081,I… I wish I knew what to say.
00:02:45.373,00:02:50.712,"Well, I was actually just drafting my own suicide note. Just now."
00:02:51.379,00:02:52.714,Dear everybody.
00:02:53.214,00:03:09.355,"As some of you know, I have 32 fleeting minutes of happiness per school day during lunch, which has been eaten up, again and again, by the same especially badly dressed student."
00:03:09.439,00:03:12.525,"And I finally thought, you know what?"
00:03:12.734,00:03:18.031,"I would rather have the dark, empty nothingness."
00:03:18.239,00:03:23.161,I really would. It sounds relaxing.
00:03:24.078,00:03:26.331,"Have a nice life without me, fuckers."
00:03:26.456,00:03:28.958,You are so gonna get fired when I actually do it.
00:03:29.083,00:03:31.377,"Well, not for sure, but I can dream."
00:03:37.675,00:03:40.470,"Around second grade, I had a realization."
00:03:41.679,00:03:44.224,There are two types of people in this world.
00:03:44.432,00:03:49.437,The people who radiate confidence and naturally excel at life… Yes! Yes!
00:03:49.520,00:03:52.565,…and the people who hope all those people die in a big explosion.
00:03:59.614,00:04:00.698,Bye.
00:04:00.782,00:04:02.325,His biggest one?
00:04:02.408,00:04:03.660,My mother.
00:04:04.494,00:04:06.246,"Bye, sweetheart."
00:04:07.038,00:04:08.665,"Look, check it out. I won."
00:04:09.040,00:04:11.793,"Okay, boss-lady. See you tonight."
00:04:18.424,00:04:21.636,Nadine. We're not doing this again.
00:04:22.345,00:04:24.681,"You promised. Now, get out of the car."
00:04:28.059,00:04:29.310,"Well, that's it."
00:04:46.911,00:04:49.831,And the only one who could handle either of us was Dad.
00:04:50.456,00:04:51.499,I hate you.
00:04:54.294,00:04:55.336,"Hey, hey, hey."
00:04:58.506,00:05:00.383,having to manage us both.
00:05:05.263,00:05:06.472,"All right, now."
00:05:06.973,00:05:08.891,I know kids can be mean.
00:05:14.439,00:05:16.316,fart into their backpacks.
00:05:20.653,00:05:22.322,I wish you were small.
00:05:28.745,00:05:31.748,"Instead, the most attention I got at school was from these three."
00:05:34.125,00:05:35.335,Nobody likes you.
00:05:35.668,00:05:38.171,You suck and you're gonna get AIDS.
00:05:45.928,00:05:51.392,"and I couldn't take one more second of this intolerable, unlivable nightmare of a… Excuse me."
00:05:57.190,00:05:58.441,"Can you move, please?"
00:06:05.364,00:06:06.991,And her breath smelled of SweeTARTS.
00:06:10.119,00:06:11.412,You wanna hold him?
00:06:12.747,00:06:15.124,But don't squash him.
00:06:22.548,00:06:23.716,"Hi, guy."
00:06:24.425,00:06:26.969,"If you want, you could be his other mom with me."
00:06:28.429,00:06:29.430,Really?
00:06:30.723,00:06:34.185,I'm gonna be your other mom and take such good care of you.
00:06:41.442,00:06:44.403,But I had finally made my first friend.
00:06:45.863,00:06:48.866,We told each other things we never thought we'd say out loud.
00:06:49.158,00:06:55.832,"Once, my grandpa's pajama flap accidentally came open, and I saw his wiener and got real sad."
00:06:56.040,00:07:00.670,"My mom has to take medicine, or she'll get upset and buy too much at the mall."
00:07:01.254,00:07:02.505,It's true.
00:07:10.638,00:07:13.057,This pudding is delicious! I'm walking away.
00:07:13.182,00:07:15.268,"Am I, your mother? Am I supposed to babysit you?"
00:07:17.979,00:07:19.480,We could play with this.
00:07:19.689,00:07:22.066,We could play with Mr. Penguin. Hee-hee.
00:07:26.904,00:07:30.992,"And then, some extremely fucked up shit happened."
00:07:32.535,00:07:34.078,"Oh, my God."
00:07:34.662,00:07:36.038,I knew it.
00:07:39.500,00:07:41.335,It's really just the hair.
00:07:41.586,00:07:44.505,It's not that bad. You can just grow it out.
00:07:44.589,00:07:46.340,Are you even up there?
00:07:47.300,00:07:49.051,"Hey, move. I gotta pee."
00:07:52.513,00:07:54.223,And that asshole knew it.
00:07:55.683,00:07:58.352,"That night, I picked up some cheeseburgers with my dad."
00:07:58.478,00:08:00.980,What do I have that's any good? What have I ever had?
00:08:02.690,00:08:04.442,You have love. You have my love.
00:08:04.650,00:08:06.527,Very soon you're gonna have cheeseburgers.
00:08:07.236,00:08:08.279,"Oh, look!"
00:08:09.280,00:08:12.033,Did I not tell you? Cheeseburgers.
00:08:12.116,00:08:13.284,Mmm.
00:08:14.368,00:08:16.579,"-You want a fry? -Oh, yeah."
00:08:21.167,00:08:23.127,"Oh, hey. That was Billy Joel."
00:08:23.336,00:08:25.713,You don't turn past Billy Joel.
00:08:25.922,00:08:50.279,"I might be as crazy as you say If I'm crazy, then it's true That it's all because of you Mmm… And you wouldn't want me any other way Dad?"
00:08:51.572,00:08:53.157,"Dad, are you okay?"
00:08:53.366,00:08:54.408,Dad!
00:08:54.784,00:08:55.785,Dad!
00:09:50.256,00:09:52.633,so let's just say the next few years were complete shit.
00:10:02.852,00:10:04.270,I had Krista.
00:10:04.770,00:10:07.982,This was last Friday. Look at me. I was in a good mood.
00:10:08.190,00:10:10.401,-I love spoilers. -No.
00:10:10.610,00:10:12.820,"Yes, I do. That means I don't have to watch it."
00:10:13.029,00:10:15.489,Then I can just know and move on with my life.
00:10:15.698,00:10:16.782,I'll give you a hint.
00:10:19.160,00:10:22.413,"I knew it! I knew it. They get married, yes!"
00:10:27.376,00:10:28.461,Whoa.
00:10:29.003,00:10:31.213,"God, juvy made him so hot."
00:10:31.422,00:10:33.591,"Oh, God, I forgot to tell you something."
00:10:33.674,00:10:35.009,He works at Petland now.
00:10:37.386,00:10:43.517,"I should go in there and be like, Excuse me, where are the Betta fish? Also, could you put your penis inside me?"
00:10:43.601,00:10:44.810,Not you.
00:10:47.521,00:10:50.066,What if you actually lost your virginity in a Petland?
00:10:50.274,00:10:51.984,I think it'd be kind of nice.
00:10:52.109,00:10:54.737,All the little tropical fish watching. It'd be kind of spiritual.
00:11:09.669,00:11:14.632,"How does he not realize that all that does is scream, I have a body complex worse than a girl's?"
00:11:14.757,00:11:16.258,How much does he even work out now?
00:11:16.467,00:11:19.345,It's OCD. You should've seen him.
00:11:19.553,00:11:22.640,He had a conniption 'cause my mom won't buy him creatine anymore.
00:11:22.723,00:11:24.308,Since it fucks up your kidneys.
00:11:24.892,00:11:26.685,"I was like, I know, Darian. I know."
00:11:26.769,00:11:29.897,"What, does Mom expect you to win people over with your personality?"
00:11:41.700,00:11:49.708,"Hey. So just a heads up, but yesterday, when you were giving your lecture, you were like, Blah-blah-blah, then the North seceded from the Union."
00:11:49.792,00:11:51.794,You meant to say the South seceded.
00:11:51.919,00:11:53.587,You accidentally said the exact opposite.
00:11:54.046,00:11:57.800,"I didn't wanna raise my hand and be all, Excuse me. These kids are pretty confusable."
00:11:57.883,00:11:59.635,Just thought maybe you'd wanna know.
00:12:00.386,00:12:07.810,Oh… -Great catch. -Yeah.
00:12:07.893,00:12:22.116,"Now, I know that it was a long lecture, and you probably don't recall, but was there any point during it where you thought to yourself, Gosh, I wonder what it's like to actually have a life."
00:12:25.744,00:12:34.920,"No. No, I was too concentrated on how you were effin' the whole thing up, so… Well, I understand that but just know that I haven't given up hope. Not yet."
00:12:35.337,00:12:36.547,Okay.
00:12:41.218,00:12:42.344,Hey.
00:12:43.804,00:12:44.805,Hey.
00:12:45.931,00:12:48.559,I like your sweatshirt today. It's nice.
00:12:48.767,00:12:49.852,Thank you.
00:12:53.397,00:12:54.398,Where'd you get it?
00:13:05.159,00:13:06.952,Kewlio.
00:13:10.206,00:13:12.249,Don't know where that came from. What?
00:13:14.543,00:13:15.544,I don't know him.
00:13:15.628,00:13:18.172,"Well, you would freakin' love him. He's adorable."
00:13:18.506,00:13:19.840,So you gonna hook up with him?
00:13:19.965,00:13:22.551,"No, not like that. Like pathetic adorable."
00:13:22.635,00:13:24.970,Like I wanna carry him around in a Babybjorn.
00:13:27.890,00:13:28.974,Oh!
00:13:29.058,00:13:33.062,"Oh, good, good, good, good! I caught you. I'm so glad. Oh!"
00:13:33.562,00:13:34.855,Do you like this dress?
00:13:35.397,00:13:38.150,Does it look bad? I think it looks kind of bad.
00:13:38.234,00:13:40.903,It's kind of poofy and I don't know.
00:13:41.153,00:13:42.821,Do my arms look bad?
00:13:43.614,00:13:44.615,No.
00:13:45.491,00:13:48.452,"You don't sound very believable, and you're making me nervous, Nadine."
00:13:48.661,00:13:50.371,Your upper arms are breathtaking.
00:13:50.913,00:13:52.081,Where are you going?
00:13:52.206,00:13:56.835,"Well, it's last minute, but Brent called me. The dentist one."
00:13:57.044,00:14:01.549,"And he asked if I wanted to go to Manzanita for the weekend, and I thought, you know what?"
00:14:01.632,00:14:08.180,"I deserve to be a little selfish once in a while, so… -Is that one of the, Match.com guys? -Yeah."
00:14:08.389,00:14:10.724,You should go for as long as you want.
00:14:11.892,00:14:15.271,Very funny. I'm gonna be back on Sunday. Okay?
00:14:15.646,00:14:16.981,Just in time to surprise you.
00:14:17.189,00:14:19.984,"Oh, I tried to call Darian, but he must be in his AP study group."
00:14:20.192,00:14:21.610,I'll tell him.
00:14:22.278,00:14:23.821,Be good.
00:14:29.910,00:14:32.079,"What? Huh? Dibs. Dibs, dibs, dibs!"
00:14:32.246,00:14:33.706,What are you even saying?
00:14:33.789,00:14:37.251,"Mom's fucking a dentist in Manzanita for two days, so I call dibs on the house."
00:14:37.334,00:14:38.502,-Ew! -Bye!
00:14:38.586,00:14:40.921,"Dude, you are so sick for saying it like that."
00:14:41.005,00:14:44.133,"Mom's boobs are jangling around a dentist's face. See it, Darian."
00:14:44.341,00:14:46.760,See Mom's titties all up in that dentist's face.
00:15:04.528,00:15:05.946,Ow!
00:15:13.037,00:15:14.288,"Oh, my God, I love you."
00:15:14.371,00:15:16.373,I love those teeth in your mouth.
00:15:16.582,00:15:18.959,That's your nose. You just picked my nose.
00:15:21.962,00:15:23.005,No way.
00:15:32.681,00:15:33.933,Darian!
00:15:38.020,00:15:41.190,You need to get all these people out of the pool.
00:15:41.398,00:15:45.110,"Excuse me, all of you need to leave. Bye-bye!"
00:15:45.486,00:15:47.321,"Hey, no one's listening to you."
00:15:47.446,00:15:49.448,You said you weren't drinking until after soccer.
00:15:49.531,00:15:51.283,"You failed, failure!"
00:15:51.492,00:15:53.786,"Dude, I'm not drinkin'. It's orange juice, genius."
00:15:53.994,00:15:56.372,"How drunk is she? I've had one drink, okay?"
00:15:56.747,00:15:59.500,"Now, you get your friends out of the pool."
00:15:59.959,00:16:00.960,No.
00:16:01.043,00:16:03.003,"Okay, then. I'm gonna call the cops."
00:16:03.087,00:16:05.547,"Okay, yup, you're cut off now. We're going upstairs."
00:16:05.798,00:16:08.592,"-Excuse me, I'm calling the cops. -Hey, you're retarded."
00:16:08.968,00:16:13.806,"Beep-beep! Beep! Beep! Beep! I'm still dialing. Hello, operator?"
00:16:13.973,00:16:17.309,"-Yeah, um, can you please help me? -Oh, my God."
00:16:17.434,00:16:20.813,My brother's hurting me in my no-no hole!
00:16:29.655,00:16:31.740,Why am I so grotesque?
00:16:31.824,00:16:33.117,Shh!
00:16:33.200,00:16:36.620,How do you even like me? What's wrong with you?
00:16:36.745,00:16:37.871,Stop.
00:16:38.038,00:16:39.915,I don't even like me.
00:16:41.667,00:16:43.961,I heard my voice in a voice mail yesterday.
00:16:44.169,00:16:47.214,"I was like, how could anyone stand listening to you?"
00:16:47.423,00:16:48.841,"You're just drunk right now, okay?"
00:16:48.966,00:16:50.134,I hate my face.
00:16:50.342,00:16:53.137,I hate the way it looks when I talk or when I chew gum.
00:16:53.345,00:16:58.183,"Don't ever let me chew gum, okay? Don't let me chew gum."
00:17:01.020,00:17:03.647,And then I had the worst thought.
00:17:07.860,00:17:10.612,I gotta spend the rest of my life with myself.
00:17:17.578,00:17:21.623,Let's go to your room. Don't you wanna wake up in your bed tomorrow morning?
00:17:21.707,00:17:23.125,Don't you wanna do that?
00:17:23.208,00:17:25.502,"You don't wanna sleep here. Come on, Nadine."
00:17:42.936,00:17:45.606,"Hey, is there any more aspirin anywhere?"
00:17:45.814,00:17:47.816,Maybe. Try… Try that thing over there.
00:18:07.461,00:18:09.046,"Hey, no, you don't have to."
00:18:09.129,00:18:14.301,"No, it's… It's cool. It'll just go faster, so… All right."
00:18:14.384,00:18:15.803,"So, what happened?"
00:18:16.095,00:18:20.974,Uh… Somebody let Baxter in and he pissed.
00:18:25.020,00:18:26.563,"Hey, can you do me another quick favor?"
00:18:26.980,00:18:28.690,Can you grab me those paper towels?
00:18:30.651,00:18:32.861,"Cool, and just clean up all this dog urine?"
00:19:18.740,00:19:24.163,"-Oh, my God! Oh, my God! -What the fuck! Oh, oh! God. Can you… Just get out. Get out of my room, man!"
00:19:24.246,00:19:26.331,"Just stop looking, man! Just get out!"
00:19:39.303,00:19:41.346,"I don't know, I don't know."
00:19:41.555,00:19:43.891,I swear I don't even know what happened.
00:19:43.974,00:19:46.518,I don't even know how it happened.
00:19:46.643,00:19:52.191,It was… I don't know. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
00:19:56.361,00:19:57.863,Are you okay?
00:20:03.577,00:20:06.205,I'm just… Just thinkin'.
00:20:09.875,00:20:11.210,"Okay, I'll see you later."
00:20:11.335,00:20:15.214,"Nadine, you can't just leave without saying anything. Nadine."
00:20:15.422,00:20:18.342,"Look, you're my best friend and I love you. It wasn't your fault."
00:20:23.430,00:20:26.475,-You disgust me. -That's nice.
00:20:27.184,00:20:31.521,"Go grow yourself a wispy mustache, you pervert, and stay away from my friends, okay?"
00:20:32.231,00:20:34.441,Did you just say friends plural?
00:20:39.112,00:20:40.739,Your head is too big for your body.
00:20:40.822,00:20:43.784,"It makes you look ridiculous, and you'll never be able to fix it."
00:21:07.891,00:21:08.892,Mr. Bruner.
00:21:10.602,00:21:18.694,"I didn't have a chance to do the homework last night because… Well, I don't know if you know this, but my dad passed away."
00:21:20.279,00:21:23.407,It's just been really hard to do anything.
00:21:26.159,00:21:27.911,Date of passing?
00:21:28.745,00:21:29.746,Sorry?
00:21:29.871,00:21:32.082,When… When did he die?
00:21:32.749,00:21:34.418,"Um, 2011."
00:21:34.876,00:21:36.169,Ooh.
00:21:36.378,00:21:37.421,Hmm.
00:21:37.504,00:21:41.758,"Yeah, I have a one-year expiration date on freebies for the dead and dying."
00:21:42.634,00:21:43.719,Are you serious?
00:21:43.844,00:21:45.304,There'll be other opportunities.
00:21:45.387,00:21:48.640,Your grandparents can't stick around forever.
00:21:51.435,00:21:55.272,"Okay, class, the Young Mr. Lincoln."
00:21:56.273,00:21:57.399,Uh-huh.
00:22:12.789,00:22:14.333,How was your weekend?
00:22:17.502,00:22:18.795,Hmm?
00:22:20.630,00:22:23.884,It was below average.
00:22:25.218,00:22:26.344,Yeah.
00:22:27.512,00:22:28.805,Okay.
00:22:31.391,00:22:32.559,How was your weekend?
00:22:32.768,00:22:35.729,"Oh, I, uh… I golfed."
00:22:36.938,00:22:39.357,"You know, like, mini. Like mini-golf."
00:22:41.026,00:22:44.404,"I don't know why I did that. I'll pick that up. Um, but, yeah."
00:22:44.571,00:22:46.406,-Tim's Fun Park. -Yeah.
00:22:46.907,00:22:48.033,I love that place.
00:22:49.367,00:22:50.619,We should go sometime.
00:22:50.827,00:22:51.953,"Yeah, we should."
00:22:52.162,00:22:54.122,"But with, like, a group of people."
00:22:59.294,00:23:00.420,Or just us.
00:23:00.504,00:23:02.964,"-Like, just us? -Yeah. You know."
00:23:03.173,00:23:05.342,"-I think we… -Yeah, or a group."
00:23:05.425,00:23:06.468,Yeah. Yeah. A group.
00:23:06.551,00:23:08.095,I think that would be great.
00:23:08.178,00:23:09.930,"It would be so much more fun, right?"
00:23:10.138,00:23:11.348,Yeah.
00:23:17.104,00:23:19.022,"I'm gonna catch up with you guys, okay?"
00:23:19.231,00:23:20.774,"All right, man. See you later."
00:23:24.611,00:23:25.862,-Hey. -Hi.
00:23:27.447,00:23:37.249,"Look, I just… I wanna say that, um, you're my sister's friend, and what happened the other night, you know… -Yes, thank you. Yeah, it was just… -So weird."
00:23:37.457,00:23:39.084,-I'm sorry. -I'm sorry.
00:23:39.209,00:23:47.592,"It was all me, 'cause… Uh… -It was… -It was… -Anyways… -Yeah."
00:23:48.635,00:23:52.430,Cool. I'll see you… -At the house or… -…around.
00:23:52.556,00:23:53.598,Cool.
00:23:54.474,00:23:59.104,"Hey, um… I had a really good time with you."
00:23:59.604,00:24:00.772,"Me, too."
00:24:12.993,00:24:14.077,I'm sorry.
00:24:20.709,00:24:21.751,One second.
00:24:27.549,00:24:28.466,It's cool.
00:24:34.264,00:24:35.432,Continue.
00:24:35.640,00:24:39.519,"Okay, that was weird. That was a weird thing to do."
00:24:48.486,00:24:50.572,"What do you want me to do, Nadine?"
00:24:51.615,00:24:54.117,I want you to think about how shitty this is for me.
00:24:56.411,00:24:57.495,I know.
00:24:58.163,00:25:00.040,What if I did this to you?
00:25:03.168,00:25:08.131,What if… What if… What if I liked your dad?
00:25:09.132,00:25:11.092,What if I gave your dad a hand job?
00:25:11.927,00:25:15.555,"Oh, Louis. Wow, you look so hot with that belt phone of yours."
00:25:15.764,00:25:18.099,"Wow. Oh, Krista, you're home early!"
00:25:19.601,00:25:23.521,Why? Why? Why? Why do you even like him?
00:25:23.730,00:25:24.731,I don't know.
00:25:25.106,00:25:27.108,"Yes, you do. Yes, you do."
00:25:27.317,00:25:31.571,"Is it a girl thing that, like, you hooked up with him, -so now you're emotionally attached? -No."
00:25:31.655,00:25:35.408,"Are you unconsciously mad at me, maybe, and this is like some kind of revenge?"
00:25:35.617,00:25:38.912,"Are you unconsciously mad at yourself, and this is some kind of self-punishment?"
00:25:39.037,00:25:44.125,"'Cause if that's what it is, then we can work… Will you stop talking? Because you're driving me insane!"
00:25:46.753,00:25:48.004,Please!
00:25:50.715,00:25:52.634,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
00:26:06.606,00:26:09.234,He invited me to a party on Friday.
00:26:10.151,00:26:11.820,And I want you to come with us.
00:26:18.743,00:26:21.413,"Like you're gonna go with him, and I'm gonna tag along."
00:26:26.418,00:26:28.461,I'm gonna have to see if I'm around.
00:26:28.712,00:26:29.713,Yeah.
00:26:29.921,00:26:30.964,Okay.
00:26:56.614,00:26:58.074,Thank you for coming.
00:26:58.199,00:27:00.160,"What? No, no, I'm having a great time."
00:27:00.785,00:27:03.705,"Oh, hey. Hey, look, maybe you guys can fuck on the lawn later."
00:27:03.788,00:27:05.373,"Please rise above yourself, Nadine."
00:27:05.582,00:27:07.500,"Please suck several dicks, Darian."
00:27:29.981,00:27:32.609,"Oh, hey. I want you to meet some people."
00:27:36.029,00:27:37.197,What's up? This is Krista.
00:27:38.615,00:27:40.950,"I'm Shannon. You were in my chem class last year, right?"
00:27:41.076,00:27:43.703,"Yes! Yes. Um, nice to officially meet you."
00:27:43.870,00:27:46.289,"Oh, my God. I love your outfit. It's so cute."
00:27:56.216,00:27:58.009,I don't really know a lot of people here.
00:27:58.218,00:28:02.472,"That's totally fine. Like, you'll meet people. It'll be a great icebreaker."
00:28:02.680,00:28:03.681,Sounds good.
00:28:03.765,00:28:05.725,Hi! I think I'm gonna go play beer pong with them.
00:28:17.529,00:28:22.117,"Just don't be so weird. God, why are you so awkward?"
00:28:23.368,00:28:24.869,God. Just have a good time.
00:28:24.953,00:28:27.288,Just relax. Just relax. Have a good time.
00:28:27.497,00:28:29.040,Go talk to people.
00:28:29.541,00:28:32.335,"Okay. All right, great, yeah, perfect. I'll do that."
00:28:56.151,00:28:57.402,That's two cups!
00:29:05.744,00:29:06.870,It's cool if I sit here?
00:29:07.996,00:29:08.997,Yeah.
00:29:16.504,00:29:17.964,You havin' fun?
00:29:18.339,00:29:20.008,Feelin' pretty good.
00:29:20.091,00:29:21.718,I respect that.
00:29:22.844,00:29:23.803,Hey.
00:29:24.304,00:29:25.972,Aren't you Darian Franklin's sister?
00:29:27.724,00:29:28.808,Yep.
00:29:30.101,00:29:31.436,Do you watch TBS ever?
00:29:32.729,00:29:33.730,Sometimes.
00:29:33.813,00:29:36.107,There's this old movie that's always playing on there.
00:29:36.316,00:29:40.445,It's got Arnold Schwarzenegger and the little bald guy from It's Always Sunny?
00:29:40.653,00:29:44.657,They play twin brothers. Only Arnold's all tall and buff and hot.
00:29:44.741,00:29:46.618,The other guy's little and funny-lookin'.
00:29:46.826,00:29:47.827,-Yes! -God.
00:29:49.954,00:29:51.831,-I love that movie! Love it. -It's so good.
00:29:51.956,00:29:54.375,You and your brother kinda remind me of that.
00:29:59.672,00:30:00.757,God.
00:30:19.818,00:30:20.944,How was it?
00:30:21.569,00:30:26.115,"Uh, it was probably one of the worst nights of my life."
00:30:29.911,00:30:31.621,Sorry I look like hell.
00:30:34.999,00:30:36.376,What happened?
00:30:41.965,00:30:51.432,"I was home tonight, having a relaxing glass of wine, and I got an email from his wife."
00:30:53.518,00:30:57.814,"I was about to call Dr. Hill, hysterical, but then I thought, No, Mona."
00:30:58.731,00:31:00.608,You're gonna do this on your own.
00:31:01.401,00:31:03.278,You've done everything on your own since 2011.
00:31:07.073,00:31:09.534,"God, I feel like such a loser."
00:31:09.909,00:31:10.910,You're not a loser.
00:31:11.327,00:31:14.038,"-I feel like one. -You're not a loser, Mom."
00:31:14.247,00:31:18.209,You're attractive. You're good at decorating.
00:31:18.835,00:31:20.670,You're very diligent with your eyebrows.
00:31:22.839,00:31:24.007,"Hey, did you floss today?"
00:31:24.090,00:31:26.676,"You know, gum disease is a silent killer, Mona."
00:31:36.769,00:31:38.062,Know what I'm gonna do tonight?
00:31:38.271,00:31:40.315,-What? -I wanna go home.
00:31:41.316,00:31:42.775,Fix my hair.
00:31:42.942,00:31:46.571,Put on a beautiful face of makeup and the best dress I own.
00:31:48.865,00:31:50.909,Then take it all off and go to sleep.
00:31:54.495,00:31:55.955,Fun.
00:32:24.108,00:32:27.111,"Hey, Nick. I sent you a friend request a while ago."
00:32:27.320,00:32:29.322,Maybe you just skipped over it.
00:32:29.530,00:32:32.909,Or sometimes there's a glitch where Facebook doesn't send the email.
00:32:32.992,00:32:42.502,So I just thought that I'd… inform you.
00:33:06.150,00:33:07.235,Hello.
00:33:07.443,00:33:11.948,"Hey, uh, it's Nadine from history. What are you doing right now?"
00:33:12.031,00:33:17.370,"Uh, oh, uh… Hi, I'm… -Hi. -I'm just… -Hey. -Hi."
00:33:17.578,00:33:19.372,"-Hey. You all right? -Yeah, I'm good."
00:33:19.580,00:33:21.082,"'Cause I'm good. I mean, you good?"
00:33:21.207,00:33:22.959,You all right? You cool? You all right?
00:33:23.167,00:33:27.547,-Great. Yeah. -What's up? I keep… How are you? Are you good?
00:33:27.755,00:33:29.882,"Hey, so Tim's Theme Park's open late tonight."
00:33:30.091,00:33:32.051,Do you wanna meet there?
00:33:35.179,00:33:37.181,So how come they canceled the party?
00:33:37.598,00:33:40.852,"Oh, uh, by canceled, I more meant I left."
00:33:41.019,00:33:42.979,"-Ah, gotcha. -Yeah."
00:33:43.062,00:33:44.897,"-Thanks for driving, by the way. -Mmm."
00:33:44.981,00:33:48.026,"I don't have a license 'cause I'm like, why not just have people drive you?"
00:33:48.234,00:33:51.821,People make such a big deal about being able to do things for themselves.
00:33:59.787,00:34:01.080,"Uh, you can get that."
00:34:04.125,00:34:07.086,"Um, hey, look, there's no line at the Ferris wheel."
00:34:19.390,00:34:21.392,"So tell me something I don't know about you, Erwin."
00:34:21.476,00:34:25.688,I… What are your hopes and dreams? Take me on a tour of your psyche.
00:34:25.897,00:34:30.526,"Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm just your average guy, I guess."
00:34:30.735,00:34:34.906,"Right, but if you had to expand for the two minutes that we're on the ride?"
00:34:35.073,00:34:41.954,"Right. Uh… -What are your parents like? -Oh, well, my dad… Actually, wait. Let's see if I can guess. I wanna see if I'm psychic. Here it is."
00:34:42.163,00:34:44.999,"Your mom gets on you about your grades, practicing your instruments."
00:34:45.083,00:34:48.252,She makes a great egg sandwich after years owning a small restaurant downtown.
00:34:48.336,00:34:50.088,"Your dad, quiet, gruff."
00:34:50.213,00:34:56.260,"Never really says I love you. Um… But with his stoic presence, I mean, you know he cares."
00:34:58.137,00:35:01.224,"I'm really hoping none of that was racist, but now I'm thinking all of it was."
00:35:01.432,00:35:04.685,"No, no. Not racist at all, you know. You're good. Yeah."
00:35:07.814,00:35:09.023,"Whoa! What are you… Oh, my God."
00:35:09.232,00:35:11.275,I'm sorry. Was that bad timing?
00:35:11.484,00:35:15.446,"I thought it was good timing, you're on a Ferris wheel, upset. Trying to comfort ya."
00:35:15.530,00:35:17.073,-That was weird? -We should get off.
00:35:17.281,00:35:24.997,"-We should get off. -Yeah, that was… -Hey! Excuse me, could we be let off? -Erwin. Erwin… Can we please? Can we stop the fucking ride?"
00:35:30.169,00:35:32.380,I'm sorry. I didn't mean to raise my voice.
00:35:32.588,00:35:34.799,"Oh, my God, Erwin."
00:35:40.429,00:35:42.056,-What! -You got it!
00:35:42.265,00:35:43.683,-I got it. -That was all you. Wow.
00:35:43.891,00:35:45.184,We got it. We got it.
00:35:45.393,00:35:46.602,Holy crap.
00:35:46.811,00:35:50.356,Nobody saw that. We're good. We're outta here.
00:35:52.692,00:35:54.986,This has been a really fun night.
00:35:55.194,00:35:58.322,I'm sorry if I flipped out on you on the Ferris wheel earlier.
00:35:58.531,00:36:01.284,"Oh. No, my timing was just bizarre."
00:36:01.492,00:36:04.871,I'm going through a lot of shit right now. It's a long story.
00:36:05.163,00:36:07.123,I'm sorry you're going through stuff.
00:36:08.875,00:36:10.626,"You're a really great guy, Erwin."
00:36:10.710,00:36:13.296,"-Aww. -No, I'm serious."
00:36:13.629,00:36:20.636,"I look at you and I just see this really, really, really old man."
00:36:21.554,00:36:22.597,Old.
00:36:22.763,00:36:24.223,I'm complimenting you.
00:36:24.348,00:36:29.604,"I just see this very kind, very gentle, very wise old man."
00:36:30.438,00:36:32.190,In a convalescent home.
00:36:33.149,00:36:34.400,In a wheelchair.
00:36:38.946,00:36:40.156,Thank you.
00:36:58.174,00:36:59.217,Hi.
00:37:00.551,00:37:01.594,Hi.
00:37:06.265,00:37:14.482,"I… I know you're mad at me because you think that I ditched you to play beer pong, and… I never said I was mad."
00:37:17.318,00:37:22.281,"Okay, well, I know that you are, and… Nadine."
00:37:23.241,00:37:26.118,Would you like to know an observation that I made this weekend?
00:37:26.786,00:37:28.037,Sure.
00:37:35.419,00:37:36.462,"Yeah, okay."
00:37:36.671,00:37:38.256,And you tossed me aside?
00:37:38.339,00:37:40.341,The person who's had your back since second grade.
00:37:40.675,00:37:41.926,With you through everything.
00:37:42.051,00:37:43.427,You know what? Fine.
00:37:43.511,00:37:48.891,"Because chances are, those pricks, aren't gonna give a shit about you when Darian drops your ass for someone hotter."
00:37:52.895,00:37:54.355,"You don't know anything, Nadine."
00:37:55.398,00:37:58.609,"Look, it's really shitty to hear, I'm sorry. It's gonna happen."
00:37:58.818,00:38:00.528,"No, I'm sorry, it's not gonna happen."
00:38:00.736,00:38:04.448,Because your brother just asked me to be his girlfriend and to prom in May.
00:38:09.328,00:38:10.830,"-No. -Yeah, he did."
00:38:11.038,00:38:13.124,He just asked me that.
00:38:15.376,00:38:17.420,You can't. You can't have both.
00:38:17.503,00:38:19.463,It's me or him. Pick.
00:38:20.631,00:38:22.883,"No, I'm… No, I'm not gonna pick."
00:38:23.092,00:38:24.927,It's me or him. Do you want him? Or me?
00:38:25.011,00:38:27.430,"-Nadine, this isn't a choice. -Why can't you just say me?"
00:38:27.513,00:38:29.974,"-Him or me, now! -No, I'm not gonna pick!"
00:38:30.099,00:38:31.434,You know what? Then we're done.
00:38:33.185,00:38:34.520,We're done.
00:38:38.983,00:38:40.151,Fine.
00:39:18.939,00:39:20.900,-Nadine. -Hmm.
00:39:21.400,00:39:22.485,"Hey, wake up."
00:39:22.568,00:39:25.154,You had a brain operation. It worked.
00:39:25.363,00:39:27.448,They made you pleasant and agreeable.
00:39:29.492,00:39:32.370,"Ah, just wishful daydreaming."
00:39:33.245,00:39:35.915,"Hey, the bell rang. Leave, please."
00:39:39.460,00:39:42.004,I'll call you later. Bye.
00:39:49.428,00:39:52.515,I don't wanna hear about it. Work it out between yourselves.
00:40:18.165,00:40:20.418,"In a couple weeks, Dad'll be dead four years."
00:40:23.629,00:40:26.966,"When I was on my way home today, this memory came back to me."
00:40:33.597,00:40:38.686,"It was that night, after everything happened."
00:40:42.398,00:40:48.112,"I got up to go to the bathroom, and I saw you crying so hard."
00:40:49.697,00:40:52.908,"I mean, so hard your pillow was just soaked."
00:40:56.662,00:40:58.456,That made me so sad.
00:41:01.459,00:41:05.588,I got up and I went in my room. I got my pillow.
00:41:05.796,00:41:08.007,Took the wet one for myself.
00:41:13.888,00:41:16.140,I wish you loved me that much.
00:41:19.101,00:41:20.102,Asshole.
00:41:23.731,00:41:27.651,"No, no. Hey, you're so messed up for bringing up that story."
00:41:27.860,00:41:29.236,You're so messed up!
00:41:29.320,00:41:31.572,You realize how crazy you are for bringing that up?
00:41:31.655,00:41:34.700,"Oh, I'm sorry you feel guilty for never caring about anyone but yourself."
00:41:34.825,00:41:36.452,"Oh, yeah, that's exactly it."
00:41:36.660,00:41:39.246,"-Face it, you're obsessed with yourself. -Oh, my God."
00:41:39.330,00:41:42.082,Your report card on the refrigerator like you're 5 years old!
00:41:42.166,00:41:45.544,"Hey, everybody! Hey, everybody, look! I pooped in the big potty!"
00:41:46.086,00:41:49.882,"God, do you even know what it feels like to love another human being?"
00:41:53.177,00:41:56.055,"Hey, life isn't fair sometimes, Nadine, okay? Get over it!"
00:41:56.263,00:41:59.266,"-I swear to God, I'm gonna clock you! -Don't touch me, man."
00:41:59.475,00:42:01.977,"Stop saying stuff like that! Calm down already, man!"
00:42:02.186,00:42:03.354,Stop it!
00:42:04.647,00:42:06.649,What is the matter with you?
00:42:08.692,00:42:10.486,"-I know what this is about. -No, you don't."
00:42:10.694,00:42:13.906,"Yes, I do. Krista and Darian are a thing."
00:42:15.991,00:42:17.910,"You guys think I don't know things, but I do."
00:42:22.873,00:42:24.416,Get back here!
00:42:25.543,00:42:27.753,"Oh, my God. Darian!"
00:42:30.881,00:42:33.092,Can I just ask you a question?
00:42:34.009,00:42:36.428,Is it worth turning the house into a war zone?
00:42:37.388,00:42:39.098,What am I supposed to say to that?
00:42:39.974,00:42:43.102,I'm just asking you the question.
00:42:43.811,00:42:46.313,"I'm not turning it into a war zone, Mom."
00:42:46.397,00:42:48.315,She is. Why don't you talk to her?
00:42:48.524,00:42:50.359,Because she doesn't listen to me. You do.
00:42:53.195,00:42:55.406,You'll do the right thing. I know you will.
00:42:56.949,00:42:59.577,"I mean, look at that drink you're making."
00:43:00.953,00:43:02.246,You want one?
00:43:02.329,00:43:03.581,Oh.
00:43:04.331,00:43:06.792,"What did I do to make such a perfect kid, huh?"
00:44:36.674,00:44:40.052,Could you point me in the direction of the cat litter?
00:44:40.678,00:44:44.223,"Uh… Eight, I think."
00:44:47.685,00:44:49.311,"You go to Lakewood, right?"
00:44:50.437,00:44:51.647,Sometimes.
00:44:53.774,00:44:57.444,I've seen you around. We've just never really talked.
00:44:58.695,00:44:59.738,Freshman.
00:45:00.447,00:45:01.657,Junior.
00:45:09.748,00:45:12.376,I don't even know why I said that. I don't even have a cat.
00:45:12.501,00:45:14.878,"-I just know they shit a bunch, so… -I like your shoes."
00:45:18.841,00:45:19.883,I gotta go.
00:45:21.135,00:45:23.679,Uh… Okay.
00:45:32.563,00:45:37.192,"Look on the bright side, ya know? I mean, Maybe they'll get married."
00:45:37.317,00:45:39.987,And then my best friend will be part of my family.
00:45:40.362,00:45:41.572,"Helpful, thank you."
00:45:41.780,00:45:44.324,"It really bothers me she's not giving you rides anymore, though."
00:45:44.533,00:45:47.202,"-I'm gonna have to talk to her about that. -No, you're not!"
00:45:47.744,00:45:49.163,I can't drive you every morning.
00:45:49.288,00:45:51.623,It puts me on the freeway late and adds 40 minutes.
00:45:51.790,00:45:55.544,"If you do that, I will do something equally terrible to you."
00:45:58.088,00:46:00.799,I will tell everyone on Facebook that you pluck your nipples.
00:46:00.883,00:46:01.967,How 'bout that?
00:46:09.516,00:46:11.894,"Just tell me what you wanna hear, and I'll say it."
00:46:12.102,00:46:13.854,-Mom. -I wanna make you feel better.
00:46:13.979,00:46:16.899,-What can I say to do that? -I don't know.
00:46:19.776,00:46:22.112,Here's what I do when I'm feeling down.
00:46:24.740,00:46:27.743,I get very quiet and very still.
00:46:28.535,00:46:37.211,"And I say to myself, Everyone in the world is as miserable and empty as I am."
00:46:39.463,00:46:41.423,They're just better at pretending.
00:46:45.761,00:46:47.346,Try it sometime.
00:46:47.888,00:46:49.848,It might bring you some peace.
00:47:29.513,00:47:32.099,"Hey, do you guys know where Erwin Kim is?"
00:47:32.182,00:47:33.934,I guess he hangs out around here sometimes.
00:47:34.017,00:47:36.353,"Yeah, he's workin' on his project for SFF."
00:47:36.728,00:47:37.813,SF what?
00:47:38.021,00:47:39.898,The Student Film Festival.
00:47:40.983,00:47:42.276,-Right. -Yeah.
00:47:43.694,00:47:44.903,SFF.
00:48:12.097,00:48:14.558,"Hey, um, I gotta talk to you about some homework."
00:48:25.485,00:48:27.613,"I didn't need to talk to you about homework, I lied."
00:48:32.909,00:48:34.911,You enjoying my company?
00:48:35.662,00:48:37.539,You're a barrel of monkeys.
00:48:41.501,00:48:43.170,You never told me if you have a wife.
00:48:49.009,00:48:51.094,Her last boyfriend turned out to be an Internet perv.
00:48:51.178,00:48:53.180,"She's very, very fragile."
00:48:53.388,00:48:54.806,"Very Oh, save me."
00:48:55.098,00:48:56.433,"Men like that, right, though?"
00:48:56.516,00:49:00.145,'Cause at the end of the day they all wanna be a hero.
00:49:00.520,00:49:02.522,Everyone just wants to feel important in life.
00:49:03.273,00:49:06.902,"Thing is, however important they are, there's always gonna be someone more important."
00:49:06.985,00:49:08.612,People get so uptight about that.
00:49:08.737,00:49:10.113,"Oh, no! They're better than me."
00:49:10.322,00:49:17.287,"It's like, God, they don't realize It's confidence. The most confident person in the room wins every single time."
00:49:17.371,00:49:18.497,Doesn't matter if it's real.
00:49:18.580,00:49:20.749,Doesn't matter if they're pullin' it outta their ass.
00:49:20.832,00:49:23.043,People are dumb. They don't know the difference.
00:49:32.386,00:49:33.512,You know what?
00:49:33.595,00:49:37.891,I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna tell you the real reason I'm having lunch with you.
00:49:41.520,00:49:45.148,"You see, I don't really have any friends at the moment."
00:49:45.232,00:49:49.194,"And to be completely honest with you, I'm not interested at all."
00:49:49.403,00:49:51.822,My entire generation is a bunch of mouth-breathers.
00:49:52.030,00:49:54.783,They have a seizure if you take their phone away for a second.
00:49:54.866,00:49:56.451,They can't communicate without emojis.
00:49:56.535,00:50:01.915,"They actually think the world wants to know they are, Eating a taco! smiley face, smiley face."
00:50:02.124,00:50:03.583,Like we give a fuck.
00:50:05.210,00:50:07.045,I am an old soul.
00:50:07.254,00:50:12.968,I like old music and old movies and even old people.
00:50:13.051,00:50:18.724,"Bottom line is I have nothing in common with the people out there, and they have nothing in common with me."
00:50:21.852,00:50:23.103,Nadine?
00:50:23.770,00:50:24.771,Max?
00:50:26.022,00:50:29.985,Maybe nobody likes you.
00:50:34.281,00:50:36.074,You're a dick.
00:50:36.658,00:50:38.910,"Maybe nobody likes you, huh?"
00:50:39.119,00:50:41.246,"You know, you're always in a shit mood."
00:50:41.371,00:50:43.039,You're a really shitty teacher.
00:50:43.248,00:50:47.043,"You put zero effort into everything you do here, and there's no way you're proud of that."
00:50:47.252,00:50:50.589,"Look at you. Look at, like, you do nothing. Look at your hair."
00:50:50.756,00:50:52.674,You don't do your hair 'cause you've got none.
00:50:54.217,00:50:55.969,You know what? Know why you're not married?
00:50:56.052,00:51:01.308,"Because bald men are gross, and they're disgusting and especially the ones that make $45,000 a year."
00:51:23.622,00:51:24.623,What?
00:51:29.753,00:51:37.427,"I've been doin' this 23 years, and you're the first person to ever underestimate my salary."
00:51:40.514,00:51:42.057,That made me feel good.
00:51:42.265,00:51:44.226,"I mean, that part."
00:51:57.197,00:51:58.323,What are you doing?
00:52:00.367,00:52:02.160,I'm giving you half my cookie.
00:52:03.537,00:52:04.746,Why?
00:52:06.289,00:52:08.917,Make you feel better. Jesus.
00:52:14.089,00:52:15.298,Guess what?
00:52:17.217,00:52:19.010,You're my favorite student.
00:52:20.262,00:52:21.555,Does that help?
00:52:32.482,00:52:34.359,Am I really your favorite student?
00:52:35.777,00:52:37.779,Felt like the right thing to say.
00:52:45.328,00:52:49.624,"I didn't mean like completely bald, by the way."
00:52:49.833,00:52:53.587,"It's smart what you do there, too. You kind of, you know."
00:52:53.920,00:52:56.548,I don't know. Do you poof it up a little bit?
00:52:57.382,00:52:58.508,Give a little zhuzh?
00:52:59.259,00:53:01.636,Glad you circled back around and cleaned that up.
00:53:01.845,00:53:03.722,Certainly made me feel better.
00:53:06.808,00:53:10.437,"The dog's good, but our real competition is the hypnotoad."
00:53:21.364,00:53:23.450,Practice is so totally boring.
00:54:18.463,00:54:19.464,Hey.
00:54:19.631,00:54:22.467,"Hey, I heard you were looking for me at lunch."
00:54:22.717,00:54:24.511,"Yeah, I can't talk right now."
00:54:24.719,00:54:25.720,"Oh, okay."
00:54:25.929,00:54:27.639,I just got… Okay.
00:54:44.781,00:54:47.617,"Sorry. Um, I just took some medicine."
00:54:47.701,00:54:48.994,I'll call you after it kicks in.
00:54:49.077,00:54:51.079,"Wait, wait, what's wrong? Are you sick?"
00:54:51.371,00:54:52.706,"No, I'm fine. I'm not… No."
00:54:52.914,00:54:56.668,"Medicine, like, an antidepressant-whatever."
00:54:56.751,00:54:58.503,They gave 'em to me when my dad died.
00:54:58.586,00:55:00.880,"Um, I was only on them for like a month, though."
00:55:00.964,00:55:03.633,"People take them, like, all the time. It's totally normal."
00:55:04.926,00:55:06.177,Oh.
00:55:06.469,00:55:08.722,Does that make you think I'm pathetic all of a sudden?
00:55:10.515,00:55:12.600,I think you're perfectly fine.
00:55:13.685,00:55:14.686,Seriously.
00:55:23.987,00:55:26.197,"Hey, do you have a swimming pool?"
00:55:26.489,00:55:27.490,Yeah.
00:55:27.866,00:55:29.534,Can I come swim in it?
00:55:29.617,00:55:32.412,I know I could swim in mine. I just know I wouldn't relax.
00:55:32.579,00:55:33.580,Yes.
00:55:33.663,00:55:36.458,I got towels. We're good to go. We're green. We're good.
00:55:36.666,00:55:39.169,-Okay. Cool. -I'll text you the address.

00:56:18.917,00:56:20.794,Why didn't you tell me you were rich?
00:56:21.002,00:56:23.046,I thought I did. I always try to tell everyone.
00:56:26.216,00:56:28.927,"You didn't tell me that you were in a film festival, either."
00:56:29.928,00:56:31.638,"You don't tell me anything, Erwin."
00:56:31.971,00:56:36.559,"Well, maybe it's because I couldn't get a word in."
00:56:37.352,00:56:39.646,"-Do I really talk that much? -Oh, yeah."
00:56:40.271,00:56:42.941,I'm gonna drown myself now. Goodbye.

00:57:22.772,00:57:24.482,You ever feel like you have to do that?
00:57:24.607,00:57:27.318,"I mean, come on. There's a waterfall. It's all romantic."
00:57:27.569,00:57:29.821,Sure. Yeah. Right.

00:57:39.330,00:57:40.832,You don't say that stuff to a man.
00:57:40.915,00:57:42.375,"Oh, a man, huh?"
00:57:45.462,00:57:47.714,"Erwin, come… What are you doing?"

00:58:29.088,00:58:30.757,Still figuring it out.
00:58:30.840,00:58:35.720,Uh… My drawing teacher asked a few of us to enter an animation project.
00:58:35.803,00:58:39.641,"Oh, that's cool. I didn't know you draw. What kinda stuff?"
00:58:45.688,00:58:47.106,"Damn, Erwin."
00:58:47.190,00:58:49.192,"This is, uh, mostly unfinished."
00:58:49.359,00:58:56.324,"Just doodling, mostly. But not quite where I… Oh, I think I found my favorite."
00:58:56.407,00:58:59.285,"Oh, yeah, my parents love that one, too."
00:58:59.494,00:59:01.454,"-Do they? -No, they don't."
00:59:01.663,00:59:03.998,"No, they're very conservative. No. They don't."

00:59:26.980,00:59:28.356,To see the film?
00:59:28.731,00:59:34.195,"It's early in the morning, super inconvenient, so… I hope you say yes, but you can take that and think about it."
00:59:34.404,00:59:36.114,"I don't expect an answer, like, right now."
00:59:36.197,00:59:38.741,'Cause that would be rude. That's a lot of pressure.
00:59:39.367,00:59:42.120,"So, just laying it out there."
00:59:42.787,00:59:44.455,"Yeah, I'd love to come."
00:59:45.582,00:59:46.791,Oh. Okay.
00:59:47.000,00:59:50.169,Are your parents going? I could just sit with them.
00:59:50.378,00:59:54.340,"Well, my parents are in Korea for three months."
00:59:55.008,00:59:56.801,-So they won't make it. -Are you serious?
00:59:58.052,01:00:00.680,You've had this whole place to yourself for three months?
01:00:04.934,01:00:08.771,"No, I get it. It's… It's a big house. You're bored."
01:00:09.772,01:00:11.399,You know what you need?
01:00:11.608,01:00:14.611,"You need someone to rob you, so you can reenact Home Alone."
01:00:14.736,01:00:19.741,That is… That is exactly what I need. Thank you.
01:00:37.258,01:00:38.843,That's crazy.
01:00:39.260,01:00:40.678,You're so bad.
01:00:42.972,01:00:44.557,I can't get out.
01:00:46.267,01:00:47.977,Can you just go around the block once?
01:00:48.728,01:00:50.063,I'm not doing that. We're here.
01:00:50.146,01:00:52.023,"Look, it's an inappropriate time. Just go."

01:00:59.405,01:01:01.491,"Oh, my God."
01:01:01.949,01:01:04.202,Are we really back to this again?
01:01:05.411,01:01:07.830,"Oh, you've got to be kidding me."
01:01:11.376,01:01:13.378,Thank you. You could just loop around up here.
01:01:13.503,01:01:14.712,"No, no, no."
01:01:15.630,01:01:17.882,I'm going to work. You're coming with me.
01:01:18.007,01:01:22.720,"You know, my boss isn't gonna be happy about it, and you're the one that gets to explain it to him."
01:01:28.393,01:01:30.186,Schoolwork or something?
01:01:33.523,01:01:34.816,Hmm?
01:01:53.000,01:01:54.836,-Can I have this hole punch? -Give that to me.
01:01:54.919,01:01:59.340,I want you to sit there for the next eight hours and don't touch anything and don't make any noise.
01:02:02.468,01:02:03.678,Can I mime?
01:02:14.856,01:02:16.399,You're not funny.
01:02:17.900,01:02:27.076,If my husband had any idea what I was gonna have to deal with… I love how you refer to him as your husband.
01:02:27.744,01:02:28.786,He is my husband.
01:02:28.870,01:02:31.038,You can run off and get a new husband.
01:02:31.122,01:02:35.626,"What he is, is my dad. Can't you just -say that occasionally? -Fine."
01:02:36.753,01:02:39.964,We're not talking about him right now because it's just too upsetting.
01:02:40.047,01:02:44.469,It's just too hard and too sad and it gives me a cluster headache. I know.
01:02:45.762,01:02:47.513,"Oh, my God."
01:02:50.308,01:02:54.604,"Actually, I'm just bored because I know everything you're gonna do before you do it."
01:02:55.062,01:02:57.106,"-Sure you do. -Oh, you don't believe me."
01:02:57.815,01:02:58.816,"No, I don't."
01:02:58.900,01:03:01.736,I'm gonna write down the next thing you're gonna say to me.
01:03:02.403,01:03:08.242,I'm not gonna play… -Congratulations. -Hmm.
01:03:11.829,01:03:15.792,You know what? Here's something you're not gonna guess… Hmm.
01:03:17.460,01:03:20.880,Your dad would be so disappointed in the way you're turning out.
01:03:29.013,01:03:30.640,Did you just take my keys?
01:03:35.061,01:03:36.354,Nadine.
01:03:49.951,01:03:51.202,I will call the police!
01:04:09.929,01:04:11.138,God.
01:04:31.033,01:04:33.786,"Nick, I'm just gonna say it."
01:04:33.911,01:04:36.163,I like you. I've liked you for months.
01:04:36.956,01:04:39.917,"I think about you every second. I don't know, maybe I even love you."
01:04:40.042,01:04:42.879,You're so complicated. But simple.
01:04:43.087,01:04:45.172,And I just feel this connection between us.
01:04:45.298,01:04:48.885,"I feel like I already know you, and I just wanna be with you."
01:04:49.552,01:04:51.137,I wanna give you head.
01:04:51.429,01:04:54.056,I want you to put your mouth on my tits.
01:04:54.265,01:04:56.475,I wanna feel you inside me.
01:04:56.726,01:04:58.603,We can do it in the Petland stockroom.
01:04:59.103,01:05:00.104,Nadine.
01:05:02.273,01:05:04.025,"Oh, my God."
01:05:06.277,01:05:07.904,"Oh, my God."
01:05:08.237,01:05:11.741,You sound like a fuckin' psychopath.
01:05:14.410,01:05:15.578,You can't send this.
01:05:17.079,01:05:18.039,What? No.
01:05:20.249,01:05:21.751,"Oh, my God."
01:05:22.752,01:05:24.670,"Oh, my God, no way. No, no, no way. No."
01:05:25.129,01:05:26.297,Fuck!
01:05:26.505,01:05:28.090,"Oh, my God!"
01:05:29.258,01:05:30.968,Shit.
01:05:44.523,01:05:49.904,"Look, I don't wanna take up a ton of your time, but I'm gonna kill myself."
01:05:54.450,01:05:57.411,You're complicated. And simple.
01:05:57.954,01:06:00.873,And I just feel this connection between us.
01:06:01.415,01:06:02.667,Feel like I already know you.
01:06:02.750,01:06:04.835,This is kinda sweet. I think you're overreacting.
01:06:04.961,01:06:09.715,I just wanna be with you. I wanna give you head.
01:06:10.466,01:06:25.731,I want you to put your mouth on my tits. I wanna feel you… …inside me. We can do it in the Petland stockroom.
01:06:29.819,01:06:30.903,Say something.
01:06:31.779,01:06:34.532,"Oh, my God. Say something, please! Help me!"
01:06:35.032,01:06:37.618,You need to watch out for run-on sentences.
01:06:37.952,01:06:39.120,Can't you just do something?
01:06:39.203,01:06:40.663,Can't you just do something?
01:06:40.913,01:06:42.832,You've gotta be able to do something.
01:06:49.130,01:06:50.965,"Oh, his computer. His computer."
01:06:51.090,01:06:53.551,"You can maybe, uh, get his address."
01:06:53.676,01:06:55.553,"If you get it, and confiscate his phone."
01:06:55.636,01:06:57.263,Great. Get his address. Give it to me.
01:06:57.346,01:07:00.725,"I'm gonna go there, and I'm… Nadine, Nadine."
01:07:01.767,01:07:06.522,"Just take fifth period off, all right? Try to relax."
01:07:06.814,01:07:09.859,Listen to some music. Have a yogurt.
01:07:10.234,01:07:14.613,Maybe just take it easy. Can you do that?
01:07:15.239,01:07:23.372,"And… If you have any, you know, complications, let me know."
01:07:24.665,01:07:25.666,Okay.
01:07:27.877,01:07:29.253,-Okay? -Okay.
01:07:29.420,01:07:30.755,-Don't worry. -Thank you.
01:07:31.380,01:07:32.965,It's gonna be okay.
01:07:33.090,01:07:34.133,Thank you.
01:07:35.843,01:07:37.928,Can I have some money for the yogurt?
01:07:42.641,01:07:44.268,I want change.
01:08:15.591,01:08:18.260,I've never been more humiliated in my entire life.
01:08:20.888,01:08:24.100,"Okay, Nadine, so now I need you to pick up the phone."
01:08:28.813,01:08:31.607,"If you think you're keeping that phone, you are dreaming."
01:08:31.690,01:08:34.151,"The second you come home, that phone is going."
01:08:54.296,01:08:56.132,"Please, God, help me."
01:09:04.265,01:09:06.308,Why do I even bother?
01:09:08.978,01:09:14.150,Why do I even… You've never given me one thing.
01:09:16.318,01:09:21.198,"Any time I ask you for anything, you're like, Oh, you need help with something? Let me help you."
01:09:21.365,01:09:24.285,I'm just playin'. I'm gonna butt-fuck you some more.
01:09:50.227,01:09:51.604,Who is this?
01:10:00.529,01:10:02.072,"Oh, my God."

01:14:00.018,01:14:02.438,"-What is all this crap? -Just please, stop for a second."
01:14:02.521,01:14:03.981,She left her flat iron on.
01:14:04.106,01:14:07.067,"-She wants to burn the house down! -Can you stop for a second, please?"
01:14:07.151,01:14:08.444,This is going.

01:14:20.914,01:14:22.332,"Oh, my God."
01:14:24.209,01:14:27.212,"Oh, my God. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
01:14:32.426,01:14:35.262,I just don't have anybody else. You're the only one.
01:14:42.144,01:14:43.562,What are you doing?
01:14:43.979,01:14:45.481,I'm handling it.
01:15:01.497,01:15:02.956,Wow.
01:15:03.040,01:15:05.667,"Look at this view, it's amazing."
01:15:34.112,01:15:36.114,I'm not gonna be an asshole and tell you.
01:15:38.742,01:15:45.249,"Look, you know what to do… I love this song."
01:15:46.917,01:15:50.546,Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane It's really good.
01:16:32.296,01:16:35.299,There's so much that I've wanted to tell you and ask you.
01:16:35.382,01:16:37.759,And I just can't believe this is happening.
01:16:44.558,01:16:47.019,"Oh, wow, this just keeps going back, doesn't it?"
01:17:14.796,01:17:16.465,"Oh, God."
01:17:17.633,01:17:29.227,"I… I don't know if… Hold on, I gotta… No, get off! Get off! Off!"
01:17:29.311,01:17:30.646,-Get off! -Okay! Okay.
01:17:33.565,01:17:34.691,What the hell?
01:17:59.966,01:18:01.885,"I, uh… I really liked that song earlier."
01:18:04.805,01:18:06.181,"Uh, I don't remember."
01:18:08.809,01:18:10.811,I can just google it.
01:18:18.735,01:18:24.324,"Anyway, do you maybe wanna go for a walk or something?"
01:18:29.871,01:18:32.916,We could maybe catch a movie.
01:18:36.837,01:18:39.965,Or we could sit here silently in your Mercury Marquis all night.
01:18:43.260,01:18:44.344,Are you serious?
01:18:45.470,01:18:47.681,"-What? -What, now you're making fun of my car?"
01:18:47.764,01:18:49.891,What? No. I was just being specific.
01:18:50.016,01:18:51.810,I wasn't saying that because it's shitty.
01:18:51.977,01:18:53.353,"-All right. -No, God, no."
01:18:53.437,01:18:55.689,"Look, I love your car. Okay? I don't even have a car."
01:18:58.066,01:19:00.193,And please stop. Please don't leave.
01:19:26.928,01:19:28.221,-Fuck! -What?
01:19:28.305,01:19:30.223,-I don't understand you. -What do you… What?
01:19:30.348,01:19:32.517,"-What do you want? -What do you mean, what do I want?"
01:19:32.601,01:19:33.685,What do you want?
01:19:33.894,01:19:35.896,To talk. To get to know you.
01:19:35.979,01:19:37.647,Not just do it in the first five seconds.
01:19:37.731,01:19:41.651,"You wrote me a novel about how you were dying to blow me in Petland, you psycho."
01:19:42.736,01:19:44.362,I'm not here to get to know you.
01:19:46.907,01:19:48.158,This is so stupid.
01:19:48.283,01:19:51.620,So stupid. Why didn't I listen to my friends?
01:19:56.374,01:19:58.752,"Oh, come on. Come on."
01:19:59.461,01:20:01.379,"Oh, now you're gonna try to make me the bad guy?"
01:20:01.463,01:20:02.798,You're the one who messaged me.
01:20:02.923,01:20:04.925,I hope you hit a tree in this piece of shit.
01:20:05.008,01:20:06.802,I hope you get fucking paralyzed!
01:21:24.212,01:21:25.797,"Let's go, lady."
01:21:27.215,01:21:29.551,Did you get a doughnut from these people?
01:21:30.719,01:21:31.928,No.
01:22:05.837,01:22:07.172,Why is that baby in your house?
01:22:07.339,01:22:11.051,"Oh, shit. How the hell'd that thing get in here?"
01:22:11.259,01:22:12.260,Hello.
01:22:14.888,01:22:17.557,This is Toby. And this is Greer.
01:22:20.268,01:22:21.978,"-Good, how are you doin'? -Good."
01:22:22.228,01:22:23.605,Nice to meet you.
01:22:23.897,01:22:27.400,"Hi, nice… Now, your mother's number?"
01:22:33.490,01:22:35.116,Let me smell. Hold on.
01:22:42.582,01:22:44.334,Don't stare. It makes him self-conscious.
01:22:47.295,01:22:49.673,Any ice cream or anything before I put the baby down?
01:22:51.508,01:22:53.802,"No, no, I can feed and water her from here."
01:22:53.885,01:22:54.970,All right.
01:22:55.095,01:22:57.847,"All right. Come on, tiny man. It's you and me, buddy."
01:23:02.310,01:23:06.982,"Look, I just want to say, I don't know the whole story, but, whatever it is, it'll pass."
01:23:07.107,01:23:09.484,"I went through a rough time not too long ago, too."
01:23:09.776,01:23:11.069,But look where it led me.
01:23:11.361,01:23:13.196,This is the face of hope.
01:23:17.117,01:23:18.535,All right. Good night.
01:23:18.994,01:23:20.870,"I'll be in, in a minute. All right. Good night."
01:23:22.998,01:23:24.708,"-Good night. -Night-night, Daddy."
01:23:24.791,01:23:26.001,Night-night.
01:23:28.503,01:23:30.005,I think that's for you.
01:23:32.799,01:23:33.842,Come on.
01:23:40.765,01:23:43.768,"No, that's not my mother. Don't open the door."
01:23:44.310,01:23:45.937,Hello there.
01:23:57.532,01:23:58.825,What are you doing here?
01:23:59.034,01:24:00.410,Get in the car. Let's go.
01:24:00.493,01:24:02.746,"-No, Mom's picking me up. -No, she's not."
01:24:02.829,01:24:03.955,Get in the car.
01:24:05.540,01:24:08.334,"Well, I don't feel like getting in the car with you and her."
01:24:11.963,01:24:13.882,Do you know what I've been doing all night?
01:24:17.093,01:24:19.471,"-Hey. Hey, get in the car. -Stop!"
01:24:19.679,01:24:21.139,"No, you think this is fun for me?"
01:24:23.266,01:24:24.309,Where were you?
01:24:25.560,01:24:27.103,You can't pick up your phone even once?
01:24:27.187,01:24:30.065,You needn't pretend to care about me just because people are watching.
01:24:30.148,01:24:31.274,"Oh, give me a break."
01:24:31.399,01:24:34.903,Face it. You can't wait to take me home so you can be Mom's little hero.
01:24:34.986,01:24:36.362,You live for that shit.
01:24:54.714,01:24:56.216,Darian.
01:24:56.299,01:24:57.300,Darian?
01:24:57.509,01:24:58.718,Darian?
01:25:01.262,01:25:03.473,"Hey, I just want you to know you're right, Nadine."
01:25:03.598,01:25:06.351,"Darian, we don't need to do this… You're right about everything!"
01:25:10.063,01:25:11.856,I don't give a shit about you.
01:25:12.232,01:25:16.236,"I'm only here for me, and my life is fuckin' incredible."
01:25:17.654,01:25:18.780,I love it.
01:25:21.282,01:25:23.701,"No, I love spending another night talking Mom off the ledge."
01:25:23.785,01:25:28.414,I love only applying to schools nearby 'cause who knows what'll happen here if I'm not around to fix it?
01:25:28.498,01:25:41.886,And I love… that the one person who makes me feel like I could take a fuckin' breath… I can't have without completely destroying you.
01:25:43.888,01:25:45.223,So you're right.
01:25:46.266,01:25:48.351,You're right. It's a blast.
01:25:48.893,01:25:50.145,I win.
01:25:58.069,01:25:59.904,"Hey, can you give her a ride home, please?"
01:26:01.072,01:26:02.198,Thanks.
01:26:45.366,01:26:57.462,"Look, I'm not very good at this kinda thing. Uh… But I think we both know what needs to be said right now, so… I'm just gonna come right out and say it."
01:27:00.715,01:27:02.091,Get out of the car.
01:27:12.435,01:27:14.437,-Bye. -See you Monday.
01:28:10.493,01:28:11.703,Hey.
01:28:28.469,01:28:31.264,I'm sorry for being a bitch tonight.
01:28:34.517,01:28:36.853,For the past couple weeks.
01:28:39.522,01:28:41.691,And the past 17 years before that.
01:28:45.278,01:28:48.531,I know this isn't any easier for you. I know that.
01:28:50.116,01:28:54.329,I think some deranged part of me likes thinking I'm the only one with real problems.
01:28:55.538,01:28:57.749,Like that makes me special.
01:29:03.379,01:29:13.931,"You know, ever since we were little, I would get this feeling like… Like I'm floating outside of my body, looking down on myself."
01:29:16.142,01:29:18.144,And I hate what I see.
01:29:20.396,01:29:23.524,"How I'm acting, the way I sound."
01:29:26.486,01:29:28.780,And I don't know how to change it.
01:29:30.448,01:29:36.496,And I'm so scared that that feeling is never gonna go away.
01:29:43.961,01:29:45.588,I'm sorry.
01:29:47.381,01:29:48.549,Really.
01:29:50.676,01:29:51.969,Good night.
01:29:55.515,01:29:56.599,"Hey, Nadine."
01:30:40.810,01:30:42.854,-Good night. -Good night.
01:31:07.753,01:31:09.881,-Hey. -Hey.
01:31:11.215,01:31:12.425,You're up early.
01:31:12.508,01:31:16.220,"Uh, yeah. I got, um… I got a thing to go to."
01:31:18.347,01:31:19.473,"Well, have a good day."
01:31:25.521,01:31:26.647,You as well.
01:31:28.316,01:31:29.775,"Have a good day, both of you."
01:31:30.651,01:31:32.111,Have a great day.
01:31:37.617,01:31:38.993,Can I call you later?
01:31:40.369,01:31:41.621,Okay.
01:31:45.416,01:31:46.500,-That was good. -Mmm-hmm.
01:31:46.709,01:31:48.794,-Right? -That was so good.
01:31:49.003,01:31:50.338,I miss her.
01:32:18.908,01:32:20.159,Nadine?
01:32:27.959,01:32:30.586,"Sit back, relax, and get ready to enjoy the films."
01:32:53.484,01:32:55.695,Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
01:33:53.669,01:33:56.380,"Really somethin', wasn't it? Let's keep things going."
01:33:56.630,01:34:00.843,"Our next entry, ladies and gentlemen, -comes from Erwin Kim of… -Whoo!"
01:34:02.053,01:34:03.846,Thank you. Of Lakewood High.
01:34:04.180,01:34:07.183,"Mr. Kim, would you like to come out and say a few words about your film?"
01:34:11.812,01:34:13.397,Come on.
01:34:16.567,01:34:36.670,Hello. Thank you for coming. Um… My… Uh… Uh… You can just take this. Thanks. Thank you.
01:34:36.754,01:34:37.838,Whoo.
01:34:39.423,01:34:43.594,"Uh… Okay. Um… Well, here it is."
01:34:59.735,01:35:10.287,at Alien Planet High School… …there was an alien adolescent who was struck by love.
01:35:13.791,01:35:14.834,Hmm?
01:35:15.709,01:35:16.919,Mmm-mmm.
01:36:06.886,01:36:07.887,Hmm.
01:36:10.431,01:36:11.891,-Oh! -Aww.
01:36:14.852,01:36:16.061,Uh-oh.
01:36:20.900,01:36:22.318,Mmm.
01:36:24.945,01:36:26.280,Pool party!
01:36:40.794,01:36:42.171,Whoo!
01:36:55.851,01:36:56.977,Erwin.
01:36:57.811,01:37:10.074,"That… Oh, thanks!"
01:37:10.908,01:37:19.416,"And, uh… I got the message, all right? I know… I know she's me."
01:37:19.875,01:37:21.961,But I already figured out how great you are.
01:37:22.836,01:37:24.922,You're so fucking great.
01:37:25.881,01:37:27.967,You're like the best person I know.
01:37:31.178,01:37:33.472,What? What's wrong?
01:37:33.639,01:37:36.475,"Um, the film wasn't about you."
01:37:39.853,01:37:41.605,Shoot.
01:37:43.691,01:37:51.490,"Sorry, I thought maybe because the hair and, like, the cool shoes that… Oh… Wow. I'm one of those people that thinks everything is about them."
01:37:52.032,01:37:53.576,I'm just messing with you.
01:37:55.578,01:37:58.581,"Yeah, I'm just messing with you. I set that up."
01:37:58.872,01:38:00.249,-You shithead. -Yes.
01:38:00.624,01:38:02.543,Felt pretty good. You being nervous for once.
01:38:02.835,01:38:05.546,"And I'm just over here, like, just sniffin' my flowers."
01:38:09.466,01:38:10.467,You free to hang?
01:38:11.885,01:38:14.638,"Yeah, I… cleared my whole schedule for you."
01:38:15.014,01:38:16.724,"Oh, good. Come on."
01:38:16.932,01:38:18.017,Say hi to some people.
01:38:20.936,01:38:22.938,Dude. You did such a good job.
01:38:23.063,01:38:23.897,Insane!
01:38:24.106,01:38:25.399,"Thank you, thank you."
01:38:26.025,01:38:27.526,Guys. This is Nadine.
01:38:27.735,01:38:30.070,"-Hi. How's it goin'? -Good, how are you?"
01:38:30.154,01:38:32.239,I'm good. Thanks. That was so good.
01:38:32.323,01:38:34.533,I just can't get over it. It was amazing.
