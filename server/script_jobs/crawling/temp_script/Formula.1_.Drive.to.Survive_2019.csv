00:04:08.920,00:04:10.240,So how's it going?
00:04:12.560,00:04:16.280,"With your traveling, you have been wearing a face mask, haven't you?"
00:16:27.560,00:16:30.320,-Last year the car felt good here? -Yes.
00:16:30.920,00:16:34.000,"So you think if we're slow here this year, we're all right?"
00:23:57.960,00:24:00.280,Is it something that has been designed by your team?
00:24:00.360,00:24:02.600,Is it something that's been copied?
00:24:03.600,00:24:08.720,I think it's very easy to agree that we need to put a light on this story.
00:24:08.800,00:24:10.440,So there is no reason to delay.
00:29:15.440,00:29:21.240,"Man, I think this paddock's gonna just fucking implode from coronavirus."
00:32:53.040,00:32:56.520,"The moment that one gets coronavirus, this is killed."
00:35:44.960,00:35:47.800,Smaller teams will be struggling.
00:35:48.400,00:35:53.240,So there is indeed a genuine risk for the sport and for Formula 1.
00:36:10.800,00:36:13.200,"I'm sorry, you will have to wait. You're way too hot."
00:36:13.280,00:36:14.640,That's just the way I am.
00:36:28.600,00:36:30.200,We're not fighting on a level playing field.
00:00:18.640,00:00:19.920,Do I look athletic?
00:00:20.000,00:00:22.120,Dynamic? Intelligent?
00:00:28.280,00:00:31.160,Never held one of these things before. Only see it in the movies.
00:00:31.960,00:00:35.840,"Drive to Survive: Season Three, my one and only take."
00:00:38.600,00:00:39.440,Action.
00:00:53.520,00:01:02.520,If they're not good enough… Formula 1 racing is very much like war planning.
00:01:14.880,00:01:18.360,"No, it was a total crap, shit, awful day at the office."
00:01:21.920,00:01:25.200,This is the worst experience I've had in any race car.
00:01:33.880,00:01:34.920,We will make changes.
00:01:35.000,00:01:36.160,Hope you get it fixed.
00:01:37.280,00:01:38.440,You tell me.
00:01:43.360,00:01:44.840,Whoever's winning for us.
00:01:54.520,00:01:57.520,We're gonna remove that subject and put you in place.
00:02:05.480,00:02:07.240,Where's the fucking boot?
00:02:07.320,00:02:10.360,I'm working more than anyone else in Formula 1.
00:02:11.040,00:02:12.840,It will show itself on track.
00:02:13.600,00:02:14.920,-Vamos! -Waa!
00:02:20.120,00:02:21.080,Send it!
00:02:26.240,00:02:28.400,I feel a real responsibility to push this car.
00:02:29.800,00:02:31.520,"Let's fucking have it, boys."
00:02:40.320,00:02:43.480,I don't work this hard to not see the checkered flag.
00:02:59.040,00:03:01.680,"Trying to do it with Ferrari is, uh, is another one."
00:03:04.560,00:03:06.000,"Hell yeah, let's do it!"
00:03:07.200,00:03:09.360,Ooh… Spicy.
00:03:48.760,00:03:51.040,"How does that one pass? Mate, look at my face."
00:03:53.240,00:03:56.560,It looks like he's taking a shit. Show your eyes!
00:04:02.880,00:04:12.480,"I don't really give a shit. I know what I look like, but… Good. We're just on our way to the track."
00:04:16.360,00:04:22.240,"Mum, it's cool. Apparently, if you drink Corona, it builds your immune."
00:04:22.320,00:04:25.400,"It was never my favorite beer, but I'll drink it if I have to."
00:04:37.920,00:04:45.120,"Live from the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, with the 2020 Formula 1 season just around the corner."
00:04:45.200,00:04:46.040,Go away.
00:04:48.280,00:04:52.280,"Everyone to the bridge. All of you guys get down there, please."
00:04:52.360,00:04:53.240,Thank you.
00:04:55.400,00:04:56.240,"Hey, guys."
00:04:56.320,00:04:58.080,"All right, guys, find your marks."
00:04:58.160,00:05:02.080,You'll see 'em written there. Find your marks and stand next to your teammates.
00:05:02.600,00:05:06.240,Lauren is gonna do a couple of pullbacks between the center of all you guys.
00:05:06.320,00:05:13.440,So what we want you guys to do in this moment is really picture your goals for this year and what you're attempting to accomplish.
00:05:13.520,00:05:20.680,"Picture them and visualize them, so when this comes across, they see you all genuinely really caring about what we're talking about, okay?"
00:05:21.200,00:05:23.800,Is everybody ready? And action!
00:05:29.400,00:05:34.640,to get the 20 greatest drivers in the world on track before the season begins.
00:05:39.160,00:05:42.440,Right at camera. Look tough. Amazing. Thank you.
00:05:49.400,00:05:51.840,"All right, everybody start walking. Start walking!"
00:05:51.920,00:05:53.840,Come. Come. Start walking.
00:06:05.040,00:06:06.320,"Thank you, guys. You can go."
00:06:13.160,00:06:15.120,"-All right, man. Have fun. -See ya, mate."
00:06:28.520,00:06:34.760,"The teams, the cars, the drivers, undergoing some final preparations, waiting for that green light."
00:06:41.080,00:06:44.200,"Because it's, it's everything starting to come to life."
00:06:48.280,00:06:52.200,"With a new season, what comes with it, it's just this fantastic feeling."
00:06:57.360,00:07:00.480,"Against competitors, but also against yourselves."
00:07:03.680,00:07:06.560,"There's always a buzz, and everybody's happy to come back."
00:07:06.640,00:07:09.680,Keen to see the performance of the various teams and drivers.
00:07:10.360,00:07:13.680,But you never… You never kind of know what to expect.
00:07:22.280,00:07:25.120,that this season might not be business as usual.
00:07:32.480,00:07:34.760,"And their billionaire owner, Lawrence Stroll."
00:07:35.920,00:07:42.440,There's a lot of intrigue as to exactly what's been going on behind their garage doors over the winter.
00:08:05.480,00:08:08.840,You're gonna walk me through what we're proposing for this season.
00:08:15.120,00:08:17.880,that really commands your attention.
00:08:21.680,00:08:24.520,"Lawrence is a, uh, force of nature."
00:08:25.240,00:08:32.520,"You know, I've worked previously with owners that were billionaires, but they didn't have the goals that Lawrence has."
00:08:35.880,00:08:40.720,"He brings funding, but, uh, he also brings, uh, expectations."
00:08:47.080,00:08:47.920,Fire away.
00:08:50.000,00:08:56.640,"I thought we would start with, uh, Simon to present where we are and, uh, where we will soon be."
00:09:02.920,00:09:07.800,is we've commenced an eight-week period now of intense engineering.
00:09:08.520,00:09:13.400,"There are two major areas that we're looking at, and that remains on target."
00:09:13.480,00:09:16.320,We're trying to get that ready for the end of the year.
00:09:16.400,00:09:22.200,"So we're now really going to drill into that, and we'll be able to come back to you, Lawrence, with some news."
00:09:23.800,00:09:25.480,My name is Lawrence Stroll.
00:09:25.560,00:09:26.920,I am the chairman.
00:09:29.320,00:09:34.520,"At the end of 2018, Force India was at the height of its financial crisis."
00:09:38.880,00:09:42.280,The team has survived with a consortium of investors.
00:09:42.360,00:09:46.320,"The consortium is led by billionaire businessman, Lawrence Stroll."
00:09:52.840,00:09:58.560,"whether they'd have a job, how their children would go to school or their mortgages or doctor bills were gonna be paid."
00:10:00.240,00:10:07.280,"We acquired a team that was fourth on the grid, with a considerably smaller budget than our competitors."
00:10:08.600,00:10:14.560,I really thought this is a tremendous opportunity in something that I had a lot of passion for.
00:10:15.160,00:10:20.160,"So our targets remain business strategy, contract cost, uh, and planned development."
00:10:24.800,00:10:27.480,and I believe we can go from strength to strength.
00:10:32.640,00:10:36.920,I've always won in the businesses I've run. I plan on winning here.
00:10:41.640,00:10:48.640,Lawrence is a big character who made an instant impact the second that he first entered a Formula 1 paddock.
00:10:49.280,00:10:50.520,He's serious.
00:10:50.600,00:10:53.800,And he's investing his wealth in that team.
00:10:54.560,00:10:58.360,The only question mark is what his plans are to take the team to the top.
00:11:00.840,00:11:06.840,"After the consortium came in and bought the team, there was a change in the driver lineup."
00:11:06.920,00:11:11.080,"In comes Lawrence's son, Lance Stroll."
00:11:15.520,00:11:17.360,"You know, we go way back."
00:11:29.880,00:11:32.760,He's supported me throughout my whole career.
00:11:32.840,00:11:35.240,and introduced me to the sport at a very young age.
00:11:36.000,00:11:43.240,"A lot of people think Lance Stroll's always had it easy, given that his father's one of the most successful businessmen in the world."
00:11:44.360,00:11:46.720,But you don't win championships just by being rich.
00:11:46.800,00:11:48.880,"You gotta be talented, you gotta be quick."
00:11:48.960,00:11:52.320,There is a very fast driver underneath that helmet.
00:11:57.000,00:11:58.400,My commitment.
00:11:59.080,00:12:01.600,My commitment is what makes me such a good driver.
00:12:01.680,00:12:05.320,I'm willing to go above and beyond to tick every box.
00:12:06.720,00:12:07.560,Cool.
00:12:36.160,00:12:38.480,"This season, people are buzzing, you know?"
00:12:38.560,00:12:40.640,You can feel the energy in this building.
00:12:40.720,00:12:44.360,"I see smiles, and, uh, you know, I see, I see a vision."
00:12:45.320,00:12:46.920,We're ready to take it on.
00:12:51.040,00:12:57.200,"Although person-to-person transmission has been confirmed, it does not, thankfully, spread easily."
00:13:11.840,00:13:12.800,-He arrived? -Yeah.
00:13:17.640,00:13:19.880,Hello. Hello. How are you?
00:13:21.720,00:13:24.080,-How are you? -I just want to have a quick look.
00:13:24.600,00:13:28.800,"We've done a lot of work over the winter, preparing this year's car."
00:13:34.320,00:13:39.240,"Last season, we were seventh, coming off of a… a difficult year."
00:13:40.480,00:13:45.000,"This year's season, Lawrence says he wants everything to be six-star."
00:13:49.400,00:13:51.600,I bought this this morning. All this.
00:14:00.280,00:14:02.120,I'm not new to the team.
00:14:02.200,00:14:04.160,I've been there for ten years.
00:14:04.840,00:14:06.920,-The car's good in the simulator. -Looks good.
00:14:07.000,00:14:09.840,We got a lot of work to do to set up though.
00:14:15.200,00:14:20.080,"When you get new ownership, um, you've got to manage that situation."
00:14:20.160,00:14:24.640,"It's highly likely when ownership changes that the, uh, senior management changes."
00:14:25.240,00:14:27.240,You have to finalize it before we leave.
00:14:28.120,00:14:30.120,-I gotta leave with Lance... -4:30.
00:14:30.600,00:14:32.760,"-4:30, wheels up. -Okay, four o'clock."
00:14:32.840,00:14:35.520,-I gotta finish the prospectives tonight. -Let's finish it.
00:14:35.600,00:14:37.760,Good. I gotta be in the car at 4:00.
00:14:43.200,00:14:47.560,"You know, job security can be a bit precarious within Formula 1."
00:14:47.640,00:14:49.800,He'll want to see results in 2020.
00:14:52.400,00:14:55.600,"ladies and gentlemen, it's the moment we're all waiting for."
00:14:56.240,00:14:57.320,It's time.
00:15:14.920,00:15:15.800,How's it look?
00:15:15.880,00:15:19.680,Hopefully it drives as well as it looks. I look forward to testing in Barcelona.
00:15:19.760,00:15:22.080,You won't be able to miss us out there on the track.
00:15:28.560,00:15:33.040,You always want to be better than your competition.
00:15:33.120,00:15:35.480,So you always look above. You don't look down.
00:15:43.320,00:15:47.200,"The teams, the cars, the drivers, undergoing some final preparations."
00:16:16.680,00:16:22.120,to see if what they've spent all year designing is actually gonna work when it gets onto a racetrack.
00:16:37.600,00:16:42.840,"Sometimes, the cars work exactly as planned, and it's smooth sailing."
00:16:48.360,00:16:51.720,"But that only happens very, very rarely."
00:17:01.200,00:17:02.440,Jump out. Yes.
00:17:17.400,00:17:23.360,that they hope will be taking them to race victories and potentially world championship glory.
00:17:26.720,00:17:29.280,That McLaren's not looking too bad at the moment.
00:17:40.480,00:17:42.360,There's so many unknowns.
00:17:43.040,00:17:45.400,We have such a great history in the sport.
00:17:45.920,00:17:49.480,"When I joined, uh, the team was very much, uh, struggling."
00:17:50.480,00:17:53.920,"But we finished fourth last year and, uh, we'd like to close the gap."
00:17:54.400,00:17:56.960,"We've got, uh, two outstanding drivers."
00:17:57.040,00:18:01.120,"One very young and, uh, pretty new to the sport in Lando Norris."
00:18:01.720,00:18:05.320,"You know, Lando could be one of the future stars of Formula 1."
00:18:10.360,00:18:12.880,I do nothing and then my warm-up's on the out lap.
00:18:12.960,00:18:15.760,It's what an out lap's for. A warm-up lap to warm me up.
00:18:17.400,00:18:21.680,"I don't think this is, uh, as action-packed as Carlos' warm-up."
00:18:35.880,00:18:42.280,Zak wants McLaren to be a new version of this incredibly successful team that we all know.
00:18:42.360,00:18:46.040,There's a lot of faith being put in a guy who's still so young.
00:18:55.440,00:18:59.360,"For himself, from the team, from the fans, 'cause he's, he's not a rookie."
00:19:06.800,00:19:07.800,Wait for it.
00:19:46.920,00:19:49.840,Coming through the final corner to complete the lap.
00:19:54.920,00:19:57.600,Lando Norris. A 1:24.981.
00:19:57.680,00:19:59.080,He's gone fastest.
00:20:19.360,00:20:22.360,"when it's time, jump out and shine."
00:20:24.080,00:20:27.400,I'm looking forward to getting behind the wheel for the first time.
00:20:30.280,00:20:38.880,"the car that left the garage on day one, in terms of its color scheme, looked very similar to the one that was released to the press."
00:20:39.720,00:20:44.320,But the car itself had undergone some dramatic changes.
00:20:44.880,00:20:49.760,It was quite familiar to everyone in the pit lane.
00:21:16.160,00:21:17.840,I think everybody's jaws dropped.
00:21:22.320,00:21:27.360,very inspired by last year's championship-winning Mercedes.
00:21:32.600,00:21:34.400,Hang on. What's going on here?
00:21:51.960,00:21:53.760,"Yeah, there's something a bit weird."
00:22:10.320,00:22:12.640,He's the fastest in Sector 2.
00:22:13.760,00:22:15.680,They look phenomenal.
00:22:18.320,00:22:22.240,"It looks like it's going to be the fastest lap of the day, and of the test."
00:22:38.040,00:22:42.520,You have to design and build your own car.
00:22:43.080,00:22:57.400,"Now, the closer that car is to one that's gone before, especially if it's one that absolutely dominated the previous season's world championship, the more people are going to ask questions as to whether that's entirely fair."
00:22:57.960,00:23:00.640,"And, most of all, whether it's legal."
00:23:06.280,00:23:08.960,But being around the same pace as Ferrari can't be bad.
00:23:10.080,00:23:15.960,"No. But, uh, yeah, it's early days, so… We'll see. We'll see."
00:23:19.640,00:23:21.560,you can't wipe the grin off your face?
00:23:23.040,00:23:25.880,Sun is shining. We're in Barcelona.
00:23:26.400,00:23:28.040,Could be worse. Life's good.
00:23:35.560,00:23:37.680,"I mean, it looks like a Mercedes, that's for sure."
00:23:37.760,00:23:41.480,I don't know how… what the idea and the process is behind it.
00:23:46.640,00:23:49.720,"I think the question, the bigger question is, is it allowed?"
00:23:53.840,00:23:56.120,they weren't maybe a little bit more discreet.
00:24:16.520,00:24:23.680,"and we took inspiration from the fastest car on the grid, but it's no different than what other teams do."
00:24:28.680,00:24:33.200,"because, if it was copied, that's, in my opinion, not legal."
00:24:44.240,00:24:46.400,and everyone does have their own agendas.
00:24:47.320,00:24:52.360,"Thankfully, I leave that to Otmar to get on with, and distance myself from it as much as I can."
00:24:55.280,00:24:58.040,"And, uh… I'll leave it at that."
00:25:04.120,00:25:07.240,Let's see how this all plays out in the first race.
00:25:25.640,00:25:29.280,but Formula 1 bosses insist that this race is going ahead.
00:25:50.400,00:25:53.560,It's still too early in the season to abuse you guys.
00:25:54.960,00:25:56.480,"Give it, like, another week."
00:25:58.280,00:26:01.160,I think Australia is always super exciting.
00:26:05.000,00:26:09.160,It comes with a high degree of pressure. You get a lot of anxiety.
00:26:09.240,00:26:13.840,"Coming out of winter testing, you can't underestimate the competition."
00:26:15.160,00:26:16.160,First race.
00:26:16.960,00:26:18.120,I gotta go this way.
00:26:18.640,00:26:20.440,"It's a great spectacle, Melbourne."
00:26:20.520,00:26:23.640,There's a bit of sour grapes about this year's car.
00:26:23.720,00:26:29.600,"If they saw what they saw, but we weren't quick, you think anybody would've complained?"
00:26:30.160,00:26:31.280,Probably not.
00:26:32.000,00:26:35.200,"And in the meantime, uh, we gotta get prepared for a race."
00:26:41.040,00:26:42.440,"Clack, clack, clack, clack."
00:26:47.560,00:26:50.800,-Why don't we just gel our whole body? -I know.
00:26:56.680,00:27:02.040,"Uh, I know the team's working, uh, very hard every day to put the right measures in place."
00:27:02.640,00:27:05.240,Starting with a full-on face gas mask.
00:27:17.400,00:27:19.120,-Are you excited? -Yeah.
00:27:19.200,00:27:20.680,-Are you? -Yeah.
00:27:21.360,00:27:23.840,We all look so depressed to be racing. Have you seen?
00:27:33.360,00:27:36.800,This corner is notorious for dipping your wheel off.
00:27:40.440,00:27:42.240,-Gonna struggle into turn one. -Yeah?
00:27:45.960,00:27:48.120,-I remember talking about one and three. -Yeah.
00:27:55.400,00:27:58.400,"I'm gonna be, like, here, on the grass."
00:28:07.320,00:28:11.560,I would love to say a podium as a target to have.
00:28:13.360,00:28:16.800,This is genuinely one of the ones I couldn't think of much to say about.
00:28:18.760,00:28:21.320,There's always a possibility something can happen.
00:28:23.920,00:28:30.280,"So the latest rumor we heard, there are three or four people in the paddock with suspected coronavirus."
00:28:41.240,00:28:43.200,then the whole paddock will have it.
00:28:51.760,00:28:58.800,"still looks as though it's going to go ahead, despite two members of the McLaren team having shown some coronavirus symptoms."
00:28:59.800,00:29:01.440,"Could you sign that for me, please?"
00:29:04.800,00:29:06.160,I don't know what can happen.
00:29:06.720,00:29:08.320,You just gotta smile and wave.
00:29:27.280,00:29:32.760,"He described what he was feeling and, uh, that doesn't sound good."
00:29:34.720,00:29:37.600,"Now, we're getting tested. We're very nervous."
00:29:37.680,00:29:39.560,I think people are scared.
00:29:41.160,00:29:49.600,"This situation, this is about the health and safety of your entire racing team, the other racing teams, the fans, the officials."
00:29:50.920,00:29:54.680,We have no idea what's gonna happen in the… in the future.
00:29:56.200,00:29:59.640,"What if they ask, Do you think it's right that we're racing this weekend?"
00:30:02.680,00:30:06.960,"But at the same time, if we take the right precautions, I see no problem with it."
00:30:08.000,00:30:13.080,"And, ultimately, it's a matter for… Formula 1 and the FIA."
00:30:19.120,00:30:21.000,Microphone. It's been cleaned.
00:30:26.280,00:30:28.680,had to be isolated because of coronavirus?
00:30:28.760,00:30:31.720,The fact that he's isolated doesn't mean he has coronavirus.
00:30:32.320,00:30:33.480,Only time will tell.
00:30:36.800,00:30:38.680,would you still race?
00:30:40.920,00:30:47.200,Uh… But… Yeah. I would still race.
00:30:47.880,00:30:52.560,Um… And are you worried in any way about this? About the virus?
00:30:58.520,00:30:59.440,Stay well.
00:31:08.760,00:31:10.200,The NBA season's done.
00:31:17.160,00:31:18.720,"Oh, someone's being tested."
00:31:18.800,00:31:20.920,There's a lot of different opinion.
00:31:21.000,00:31:27.640,I think it comes down to a 50-50 split of those who are in favor of continuing and those who just want everything to stop.
00:31:32.440,00:31:36.000,ahead of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix on Sunday.
00:31:36.080,00:31:37.920,Let's open this up to the floor now.
00:31:38.000,00:31:40.400,"Alex Kalinauckas, Autosport. A question for Lewis."
00:31:40.480,00:31:49.880,"Um, regarding the coronavirus situation, are you comfortable having traveled all the way to Australia and are you satisfied with what Formula 1 and the FIA have done so far?"
00:31:49.960,00:31:54.160,"Um, I am really very, very surprised that we're here."
00:31:54.240,00:31:57.200,"For me, it's shocking that we're all sitting in this room."
00:31:57.280,00:32:00.280,"Um, so many fans here already today."
00:32:00.360,00:32:05.520,"Um, yeah, Formula 1 continues to go on, and, um… So, no, to your answer."
00:32:06.240,00:32:08.560,"If we could take our next question, please."
00:32:08.640,00:32:13.760,"Lewis, you've been outspoken, where others maybe have not dared to be, about corona."
00:32:18.000,00:32:19.200,Why are we still here?
00:32:20.320,00:32:22.280,-Cash is king? -Cash is king.
00:32:22.360,00:32:23.920,"Uh, I… Honestly, I don't know."
00:32:24.400,00:32:26.040,I can't really add much more to it.
00:32:35.440,00:32:36.600,is still going ahead.
00:32:36.680,00:32:40.400,"Anyway, nobody has an official statement, so we're waiting."
00:32:41.680,00:32:48.920,"with this coronavirus scare around the world, information is coming at rapid pace and it's changing, quite literally, every minute."
00:32:49.000,00:32:52.960,That's what the-- They said four Haas people have gone into the hospital.
00:33:06.600,00:33:11.560,"Got a phone call from, uh, our team manager to say that we'd had a positive case."
00:33:12.320,00:33:16.440,"Suddenly, this situation has blown up, with a McLaren mechanic testing positive."
00:33:17.320,00:33:19.360,Our position is we should race.
00:33:19.440,00:33:24.440,"Keep testing, and if the situation develops further, um, you know, review it in 24 hours."
00:33:25.640,00:33:29.080,I definitely don't want us to go ahead. I don't think we should.
00:33:31.240,00:33:34.000,"We, uh, really looked forward to racing in Melbourne."
00:33:34.080,00:33:37.720,"And, from a team perspective, we still wanna race."
00:33:41.080,00:33:47.400,"Authorities have confirmed that… For us, it was an easy decision."
00:33:49.760,00:33:51.960,"Ultimately, we are out."
00:33:55.400,00:34:00.840,"between the FIA, Formula 1 and the Australian Grand Prix Corporation that this Grand Prix has been canceled."
00:34:00.920,00:34:03.040,"-It will not take place. -Uh, unbelievable."
00:34:03.520,00:34:08.040,The Australian Formula 1 Grand Prix has been canceled.
00:34:16.280,00:34:20.040,if you would make an orderly exit towards the tram stations.
00:34:20.120,00:34:20.960,Thank you.
00:34:21.600,00:34:24.520,Disgusting. It's disgusting for everybody here.
00:34:33.800,00:34:37.040,"in a few sentences, what happened the last 24 hours?"
00:34:39.720,00:34:44.120,"When we arrived in Australia, the intention was to go racing."
00:34:44.200,00:34:48.920,The important thing now is to make sure that we get all members of staff home safely.
00:34:50.440,00:34:54.960,"No. I think it's fairly inevitable, if we're not racing here, we won't be racing in Bahrain."
00:34:55.040,00:34:58.000,"Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks."
00:35:02.440,00:35:06.280,"At the end of the day, we're dealing with people's livelihoods, their jobs."
00:35:07.160,00:35:08.680,Their way of earning a living.
00:35:26.640,00:35:29.320,I don't know if fans are gonna be able to attend events.
00:35:29.400,00:35:35.560,"Uh, I don't know if Grand Prix are gonna be able to be put on, which gives us the revenue to build race cars."
00:35:56.920,00:36:00.000,"As an independent team, are we actually going to survive this?"
00:36:17.960,00:36:20.040,The stakes have never been higher.
00:36:21.840,00:36:24.040,Hopefully give him a harder time this year.
00:36:24.120,00:36:25.640,"Fuck, again!"
00:36:25.720,00:36:27.840,The big story remains Racing Point.
00:36:30.280,00:36:33.280,They're dragging our name through the mud. I will not accept this.
00:36:38.280,00:36:39.360,Fuck!
00:00:17.880,00:00:23.440,"There's no plan for the race team, no plan for the race cars, but also no plan for ourselves."
00:04:45.800,00:04:49.240,How long do you think it'll be until the gloves just come off?
00:05:19.680,00:05:20.720,Perfect.
00:05:21.240,00:05:22.120,That's deep.
00:05:25.080,00:05:27.920,"Sorry, you will have to wait. You're way too hot."
00:05:28.000,00:05:29.440,That's just the way I am.
00:05:30.880,00:05:32.720,Would you like to say hello to the fans?
00:05:32.800,00:05:35.280,-We've actually got fans here? -Yeah.
00:05:35.360,00:05:36.240,Check this out.
00:07:02.840,00:07:04.520,I don't think we can hug.
00:07:04.600,00:07:06.800,-Good. You been okay? -Yeah.
00:08:50.880,00:08:53.120,"Excellent work, Alex. Thumbs up, mate."
00:10:07.640,00:10:09.220,"Don't forget the boots, mate."
00:10:33.480,00:10:35.560,You're free. Go push.
00:10:37.120,00:10:39.960,Max said he doesn't need to do any practice.
00:10:40.040,00:10:42.480,"He just needs two laps, he'll be switched on."
00:11:25.920,00:11:28.360,Let's maximize our time on the track.
00:13:00.080,00:13:01.780,Yeah. That's always the goal.
00:13:02.740,00:13:03.920,"No, it was all right."
00:13:04.000,00:13:08.080,"It's fast, don't get me wrong, but, like, it feels all right."
00:13:15.200,00:13:17.840,"OK, Lewis, so circuit's all clear. All clear."
00:13:18.320,00:13:20.560,Give yourself a bit of room so you are safe.
00:14:50.960,00:14:54.400,That's what it looks like. It's not really a steering system.
00:15:59.840,00:16:00.960,We've got the DAS.
00:16:05.240,00:16:06.200,"No, I won't."
00:16:12.520,00:16:14.180,"As an innovation, isn't it great?"
00:16:16.760,00:16:19.000,It adds a new dimension to it.
00:16:56.280,00:16:57.920,There's Mr. Todt.
00:17:04.360,00:17:05.560,Are you quick or not?
00:17:21.080,00:17:22.200,Under control.
00:17:22.280,00:17:24.840,You do the foot one. Is that how you do it?
00:17:27.160,00:17:33.120,"I think, from a fan perspective, people are just saying, Red Bull are just responding to getting whipped on the track."
00:17:33.740,00:17:35.440,'Cause that's what they see.
00:17:35.520,00:17:37.120,-So… -We'll see.
00:17:54.420,00:17:57.020,They're strong. Even stronger than we expected.
00:18:04.080,00:18:06.320,It's gonna be tough for Alex.
00:18:06.400,00:18:09.120,"If he can get in the top six, that'll be okay."
00:19:03.760,00:19:07.000,"Alex, hold Hamilton up. Keep your position."
00:20:44.480,00:20:46.240,100% pace.
00:20:57.360,00:20:58.640,"Oh, he's quicker."
00:21:48.200,00:21:51.400,Did they show a yellow flag? I couldn't see with the dust.
00:22:24.160,00:22:26.880,"Looking at his lap time, I'm pretty sure he didn't lift."
00:22:27.600,00:22:29.800,He should get a fucking penalty.
00:23:46.120,00:23:48.880,You put us back three spots now? Or what happened?
00:24:07.920,00:24:10.840,Three-place penalty confirmed for Lewis.
00:24:10.920,00:24:15.160,Surely the decision was made before 14:20 on race day?
00:24:37.320,00:24:39.560,I love the idea of keeping pressure on 'em.
00:24:39.640,00:24:42.800,Best time to do it. That'll really ruffle him now.
00:24:42.880,00:24:44.720,"Anyway, good job."
00:25:07.680,00:25:09.760,Seems like a long time since we've been here.
00:25:45.320,00:25:48.280,-At least you have a fast car. -Yeah. We needed that.
00:25:48.360,00:25:51.600,"Especially after everything we've had in the last two, three months."
00:26:14.240,00:26:15.520,Have a good one.
00:27:05.680,00:27:07.640,"Lando, urgent. Albon's behind."
00:27:15.280,00:27:16.680,Behind is Hamilton.
00:27:16.760,00:27:18.000,Confirm.
00:27:35.160,00:27:37.060,They're so fast on the straights.
00:28:17.120,00:28:19.440,"Engine nine, position four."
00:29:43.280,00:29:44.480,"Great job, mate."
00:31:45.040,00:31:46.960,This guy is such a sore loser.
00:32:18.840,00:32:22.200,"Hard luck, Alex. Hamilton, for what it's worth, got a five-second penalty."
00:32:35.760,00:32:39.920,Hamilton is 6.5 ahead. He has a five-second penalty.
00:32:44.080,00:32:45.480,Oh my God.
00:32:53.080,00:32:56.000,Go flat out to the end. Give it everything.
00:33:13.360,00:33:15.000,"Please, mate, come on."
00:33:23.680,00:33:25.440,"Look, how sweaty my hands are!"
00:34:03.880,00:34:06.720,"Lando, the gap to Hamilton was 4.8."
00:34:07.560,00:34:08.520,That's a podium.
00:35:48.200,00:35:51.000,"Yeah. I mean, I would have enjoyed it a lot now."
00:35:53.320,00:35:54.160,Cheers.
00:00:09.560,00:00:17.360,"I don't think anybody could have predicted the speed and the damage that this virus you know, could and has done."
00:00:23.520,00:00:26.560,"It's terrifying. Each and every day, it's terrifying."
00:00:26.640,00:00:33.680,"We've got to get back so that all ten teams have a chance, not a guarantee, but a chance of survival."
00:01:06.120,00:01:08.720,since the race getting canceled in Australia.
00:01:11.400,00:01:12.960,Feels like a sci-fi movie.
00:01:14.200,00:01:15.120,Very bizarre.
00:01:24.800,00:01:26.840,It's devastated businesses.
00:01:27.360,00:01:29.520,It brought us to a standstill.
00:01:30.800,00:01:34.280,That means job redundancies and pay cuts.
00:01:35.200,00:01:42.200,"Just impossible to know, uh, what the future has in front of us, and I think all we can do now is hope for the best."
00:01:51.280,00:01:52.120,"Hey, how are you?"
00:01:53.440,00:01:55.280,"Yeah, good. Just at the office."
00:01:58.560,00:02:05.960,Do you think there's a scenario where you could even just get 15 races in?
00:02:07.560,00:02:09.520,So what does that then look like?
00:02:11.120,00:02:13.520,"Two Austria, then Hungary."
00:02:13.600,00:02:17.480,"Europe, Middle East, global."
00:02:18.080,00:02:21.440,Sounds like everything is under control. All right. Good stuff.
00:02:21.520,00:02:28.160,There is good news coming out of Formula 1 as racers dust off their cars and get underway with the Austrian Grand Prix.
00:02:28.760,00:02:32.120,The British Formula 1 Grand Prix will go ahead in July.
00:02:42.880,00:02:45.480,"Ah, morning, Netflix. Back for more."
00:02:46.760,00:02:49.640,Two meters this year though. You gotta keep your distance.
00:02:59.120,00:03:01.080,Please leave your message after the tone.
00:03:01.160,00:03:05.560,Drivers. It's a problem. It's probably too early in the morning.
00:03:07.760,00:03:10.040,I'm just grateful that we're... we're racing.
00:03:10.120,00:03:14.320,"I think, to get the series up and running, it's been a phenomenal effort."
00:03:14.840,00:03:18.680,"You know, I've had ten weeks sitting at home, not doing anything."
00:03:19.560,00:03:23.000,"Teams are gonna be race-rusty on the strategy, on the pit stops."
00:03:23.080,00:03:27.000,And I think that this year will create some different scenarios.
00:03:27.080,00:03:31.560,But it feels like Mercedes could be vulnerable this year.
00:03:37.160,00:03:40.680,I think this work from home thing's been taken to an extreme in marketing.
00:03:41.200,00:03:43.880,Work from home. We never saw 'em again.
00:03:47.800,00:03:50.840,The way this is structured is everybody gets a section of questions.
00:03:50.920,00:03:53.720,They will direct a question to you when they want you to answer.
00:03:53.800,00:03:56.880,-It's not interactive between me and Toto? -It doesn't appear to be.
00:03:56.960,00:03:58.720,So I can't take the piss out of this haircut.
00:04:00.560,00:04:02.920,"Ask Susie, Have you been cutting Toto's hair?"
00:04:08.280,00:04:09.720,"Hey, Susie, how are you?"
00:04:17.720,00:04:18.640,I'm in my kitchen.
00:04:23.920,00:04:27.160,Toto's gonna be really looking forward to getting back to racing.
00:04:27.240,00:04:32.840,"Personally, I'm looking forward to seeing Toto again and hopefully giving him a harder time this year."
00:04:36.240,00:04:40.120,"but I, personally, actually look forward to the racing itself."
00:04:40.200,00:04:44.280,"Forget all the rest around it, um, let's just race."
00:04:49.840,00:04:52.000,I reckon about two o'clock Sunday.
00:04:52.520,00:04:54.360,Sunday afternoon in Austria.
00:05:04.600,00:05:09.240,This is the first race in the 2020 Formula 1 season.
00:05:10.360,00:05:15.040,The arena is open for business. The 20 gladiators return.
00:05:36.840,00:05:38.280,Hiya. How are you doing?
00:05:41.240,00:05:43.480,I'm really impressed by this. This is awesome.
00:05:43.560,00:05:45.000,I think you're on mute.
00:05:47.040,00:05:48.440,Yep. What's going on?
00:05:48.520,00:05:52.240,"You can ask me a question, or I can just stand here and dance or something."
00:05:54.640,00:05:56.360,"I want to see you dance, please."
00:05:57.520,00:05:59.040,I shouldn't have said that!
00:05:59.120,00:06:01.000,I shouldn't have said that.
00:06:03.440,00:06:10.560,"The Austrian Grand Prix is an absolute marker in the ground that, you know, Formula 1 is open for business again."
00:06:17.400,00:06:24.280,"After lockdown, we are finally able to take the covers back off the race cars and have a Grand Prix."
00:06:30.600,00:06:37.040,"Getting into the paddock, seeing the people again, knowing that you can get back soon racing, the feeling is fantastic."
00:06:48.040,00:06:50.520,"As an Austrian, I enjoy being in Austria."
00:06:51.240,00:06:56.120,"As a racing team, it's back to what we love in the sport, and that is the stopwatch."
00:07:09.960,00:07:12.440,he came into the sport very young.
00:07:18.720,00:07:20.480,and won four championships.
00:07:24.920,00:07:29.520,and then along came Toto and Mercedes and stole their ball.
00:07:31.200,00:07:32.800,And Christian wants it back.
00:07:34.200,00:07:41.240,"It's incredibly hard to keep that level of winning consistency, and all credit to Mercedes."
00:07:41.320,00:07:44.480,We managed it for four years. They've managed it for six.
00:07:44.560,00:07:48.600,"But inevitably, at some point, that comes to an end."
00:08:02.200,00:08:03.080,Have you been OK?
00:08:07.240,00:08:09.240,Stronger and fitter than ever. That's good.
00:08:09.320,00:08:12.200,"But we also have more time, so you would expect that."
00:08:13.840,00:08:17.040,"arguably, the hottest property in Formula 1 at the moment."
00:08:19.800,00:08:23.760,The thing about Max is he's got this magic dust about him.
00:08:24.680,00:08:30.760,"The dream is to win a fifth world championship, to make Max the youngest Drivers' World Champion ever."
00:08:37.960,00:08:43.640,"He had a really solid, you know, nine races for us, and put in a very strong performance."
00:08:43.720,00:08:44.960,Yes. Come on!
00:08:48.520,00:08:50.160,-Yes! -Come on!
00:08:55.920,00:08:59.120,we've got two cars in the fight with Mercedes.
00:09:00.000,00:09:04.240,"This is our best shot to win this championship, you know, since 2013."
00:09:25.880,00:09:28.000,It's too long since I've been at the track.
00:09:40.680,00:09:44.000,to see where the drivers all lie after lockdown.
00:09:50.000,00:09:54.560,"You know, you get itchy, uh, itchy feet and hands, getting back in the car."
00:09:57.960,00:10:00.320,"We've got an acronym, FSU. Fuck shit up."
00:10:00.400,00:10:02.000,That's what I'm hoping to do.
00:10:42.560,00:10:45.680,"And that's what… These guys, they're the pinnacle, aren't they?"
00:10:45.760,00:10:49.680,They should just be able to flip a switch and they're back onto it.
00:10:55.480,00:10:56.720,"Sorry, guys."
00:11:02.880,00:11:07.080,"Our goal is to get closer to third, but the competition's tough."
00:11:09.560,00:11:11.000,You have Racing Point.
00:11:14.960,00:11:16.000,And then Renault.
00:11:17.680,00:11:19.000,Extremely strong.
00:11:31.320,00:11:35.080,"Well, since I started go-karts back in 2007."
00:11:36.600,00:11:40.240,Things were pretty much just playing games and streaming on Twitch.
00:11:40.320,00:11:43.960,And that was pretty much my life. Now there's just so much excitement.
00:11:44.920,00:11:48.040,"Just being able to do what I love, driving a Formula 1 car."
00:11:50.840,00:11:53.120,Just going to take a few laps to get back into it.
00:11:54.600,00:11:59.440,"In Austria, you've got a massive long straight as you come out the pits, and you put your throttle down."
00:12:03.240,00:12:05.760,Your head gets put back against the headrest.
00:12:05.840,00:12:07.360,Your body gets compressed.
00:12:10.280,00:12:12.680,Then you hit the brakes for the first time.
00:12:14.080,00:12:18.720,"My head just fell forward and it just felt like I was, I'd never driven a car before."
00:12:19.800,00:12:21.640,It just feels a bit alien really.
00:12:24.320,00:12:28.400,"But within a couple of laps, it just felt like I was back home again."
00:12:50.360,00:12:53.560,We've had a habit of coming out the blocks a little slowly the last few years.
00:12:53.640,00:12:55.120,We need to address that.
00:12:55.800,00:12:58.720,We have to believe in ourselves. We have to beat Mercedes.
00:13:44.960,00:13:46.080,Yeah. There we go.
00:13:46.720,00:13:47.880,That's the DAS.
00:13:55.320,00:13:56.400,Not seen that before.
00:13:59.480,00:14:05.920,"Um… Yeah. As he hits the anchors, the steering wheel is moving forward."
00:14:06.640,00:14:08.000,"Yeah, very interesting."
00:14:08.760,00:14:29.680,"The reason that DAS is so clever, but also so controversial, is that Mercedes have been able to create a system that not only steers the car, but also, when you pull that wheel out and push it back in again, it changes the positioning of the tires to improve grip, which should give extra speed through the corners."
00:14:38.360,00:14:39.840,It depends how much they've got.
00:15:13.800,00:15:16.000,Monty looks so different with his hair cut.
00:15:34.960,00:15:38.160,"It's all quite tight, apart from Hamilton. I'm gonna have to go."
00:15:40.240,00:15:41.960,-Love you. Bye. -Bye. Bye.
00:15:47.520,00:15:48.640,"Hi, hi, hi."
00:15:49.160,00:15:55.680,"The DAS system that they're running on their car, the steering system, falls into a very gray zone."
00:15:56.960,00:15:59.760,So you've got your DAS on the car.
00:16:08.800,00:16:12.440,And then it's down to the FIA. They're either happy or they're not.
00:16:26.200,00:16:29.200,He likes to have these little war games between us.
00:16:29.720,00:16:31.120,But the rivalry is big.
00:16:44.600,00:16:49.280,and the serious business of forming a grid ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix.
00:16:49.360,00:16:54.240,It's the season opener and it's been a long time since the Formula 1 season began in Europe.
00:16:58.720,00:17:00.160,I'll say hello to him.
00:17:09.840,00:17:12.960,"We tried to slow them down with the DAS, but no luck."
00:17:13.640,00:17:21.000,"The FIA have judged DAS to be legal, which means Mercedes can use it on their car until the end of the season."
00:17:50.000,00:17:52.320,"Mercedes, the favorites for pole today."
00:18:00.840,00:18:02.080,got up their sleeves?
00:18:14.480,00:18:19.080,and now he comes into the races this year ready to score big points.
00:18:19.600,00:18:22.800,Ready to help Red Bull in their fight against Mercedes.
00:18:42.840,00:18:46.280,I think it's only a matter of time before he achieves that first podium.
00:18:49.440,00:18:53.880,"He did have a chance last year in Brazil, but it all went a bit wrong."
00:18:58.000,00:19:00.800,Hamilton now is gonna try and take second place.
00:19:28.200,00:19:31.560,"Frustrating. But if I did it again, I would've been more aggressive."
00:19:32.960,00:19:38.320,"I know what I need to do, and now it's more about just getting them results in."
00:20:11.080,00:20:12.160,"-Go on, boy! -Come on!"
00:20:20.160,00:20:22.480,But Norris is on a flyer just behind.
00:20:46.960,00:20:47.920,Give it everything.
00:21:05.960,00:21:06.800,Yeah!
00:21:22.480,00:21:26.160,"DRS, wide open then for Lewis Hamilton."
00:21:27.480,00:21:29.120,"Oh, and someone's had a problem."
00:21:30.400,00:21:33.880,And it's Valtteri Bottas going off into the gravel.
00:21:39.200,00:21:48.120,"If Lewis Hamilton drove through a yellow-flag zone without slowing down, it will be considered to be dangerous and the penalty will be severe."
00:22:01.520,00:22:03.960,So it looks like Lewis's time stands.
00:22:04.040,00:22:09.240,"He takes second place, behind Bottas on pole, and Mercedes qualify one-two for the race."
00:22:19.120,00:22:20.640,The drivers know.
00:22:20.720,00:22:23.560,They've grown up with that since their first races in karting.
00:22:30.360,00:22:37.840,"Against a Mercedes team that is so strong, so dominant, you have to exploit every opportunity that you possibly can."
00:22:46.240,00:22:48.840,We're in Austria around the Red Bull Ring.
00:22:58.920,00:23:00.360,in any way that he can.
00:23:00.880,00:23:05.080,"So, yeah, you'll protest DAS. Yeah, you'll protest that qualifying lap."
00:23:07.920,00:23:11.120,by just sitting back and accepting everything.
00:23:11.200,00:23:13.760,So we've got to push.
00:23:30.640,00:23:32.480,from his camera in his car.
00:23:40.240,00:23:42.520,The stewards hadn't looked at that footage.
00:23:51.960,00:23:53.840,Something's gotta slow you down.
00:24:01.600,00:24:03.120,I don't know. I don't care.
00:24:16.320,00:24:18.360,The timing of it was brilliant.
00:24:19.680,00:24:27.920,Because Mercedes had already made their way to the grid and were setting up Lewis Hamilton's grid spot from his original place.
00:24:31.440,00:24:37.240,"If you're gonna pull the rug from under your biggest rival, you wait till the last minute."
00:24:48.880,00:24:50.680,But I think we're doing it a bit different.
00:24:52.200,00:24:56.120,We concentrate on ourselves. We don't look too much left and right.
00:24:56.840,00:24:58.520,We do the talking on the track.
00:25:03.320,00:25:07.600,"the longest period in Formula 1 history, and finally we can go racing."
00:25:17.000,00:25:24.920,"Lando Norris's best ever start in third place, Alex Albon in fourth, and Hamilton, well, he's been bumped back down to fifth."
00:25:25.000,00:25:28.520,That's a big blow for Toto Wolff and for Mercedes.
00:25:36.560,00:25:43.400,"You'd like to cruise to victory anytime you're on a race track, but you know it's never gonna quite be that easy."
00:25:53.880,00:26:00.360,The one thing that we've talked to Lando about is just maybe being a little bit more aggressive.
00:26:06.360,00:26:11.840,so it's all about making sure you're always focused on what you need to do to extract the best performance.
00:26:17.080,00:26:19.800,I think we're well-equipped. The drivers are up for it.
00:26:19.880,00:26:22.080,Max is in the best shape he's been in.
00:26:22.600,00:26:28.640,"It'll be down to who makes the least mistakes, gets the most out of these early races, and particularly this weekend."
00:26:50.240,00:26:52.560,Verstappen alongside Lando Norris.
00:27:29.160,00:27:33.560,"Alex Albon might be a touch worried, Lewis Hamilton's getting within DRS range."
00:27:45.520,00:27:49.200,he missed out on a podium in Brazil and Hamilton got a penalty.
00:27:50.760,00:27:52.200,"Come on, Alex! Come on!"
00:28:05.760,00:28:09.200,"The one, two, three, four, with Lando Norris dropping back."
00:28:43.760,00:28:46.760,desperately trying to get power back into that Red Bull.
00:29:08.400,00:29:10.800,He is our championship hopeful.
00:29:11.360,00:29:15.080,"We're in a great position in the opening race, in our home Grand Prix."
00:29:25.440,00:29:28.400,It was just a punch in the guts for the whole team.
00:29:33.520,00:29:37.320,"But then, you know, we've still got a car in the race."
00:29:50.480,00:29:53.480,"Which… Okay, we've lost Max, but we should get a podium."
00:29:57.320,00:30:05.000,The fact that Albon is fighting for podiums and a potential victory shows that he's delivering on the promise that we believe in him.
00:30:06.640,00:30:10.600,"That first podium, that first victory, it removes the pressure."
00:30:11.880,00:30:16.160,There's a big difference between thinking you can do it and knowing you can do it.
00:30:33.880,00:30:39.360,That gave him a significant tire advantage for what would almost certainly be his first Grand Prix victory.
00:30:44.520,00:30:46.200,Albon has a chance at the win.
00:30:56.000,00:30:57.880,-Come on. -Come on!
00:31:31.640,00:31:32.480,Come on!
00:31:42.600,00:31:44.360,Oh fuck! Again!
00:32:00.320,00:32:02.800,and now he's tumbling down to last place.
00:32:07.840,00:32:08.760,Ugh!
00:32:14.480,00:32:17.240,for causing a collision with Alex Albon.
00:32:32.000,00:32:34.800,McLaren need to be telling Lando Norris.
00:32:49.080,00:32:52.200,this 1.5 seconds I needed for my first podium in Formula 1.
00:32:59.520,00:33:03.360,"because it was Lewis Hamilton in a Mercedes, who are a lot quicker."
00:33:03.440,00:33:04.720,Normally.
00:33:06.560,00:33:09.400,"It was, Forget about everything and just drive."
00:33:18.080,00:33:22.400,Can Norris find the lap of his life to get within five seconds of Lewis Hamilton?
00:33:23.680,00:33:55.000,"Look, how sweaty my hands… All of a sudden, I go over the line."
00:34:33.120,00:34:34.200,It was incredible.
00:34:43.200,00:34:44.080,Whoo!
00:34:52.600,00:34:58.800,"That was an awesome reward for everyone's hard work and dedication and, um, it was exactly what we needed."
00:35:09.400,00:35:10.240,Fuck!
00:35:11.640,00:35:13.360,"He doesn't like you, does he?"
00:35:14.440,00:35:15.480,It'll come.
00:35:18.800,00:35:19.800,It'll come.
00:35:21.000,00:35:22.680,You did nothing wrong today.
00:35:45.080,00:35:48.120,It'll just make you enjoy it even more when it does.
00:36:01.040,00:36:02.520,Fucking hell.
00:36:07.000,00:36:08.400,-Is that fair? -Fuck you.
00:36:09.560,00:36:12.160,-I hate to be second. -He was a sensational wingman.
00:36:12.240,00:36:14.280,"Well, first of all, wingman hurts."
00:36:14.360,00:36:18.560,"Everyone's expecting Lewis to win, but everyone cracks. Action."
00:36:20.320,00:36:22.080,The pressure is gonna be on Alex.
00:36:22.160,00:36:24.600,He needs a bit more of that fuck you attitude.
00:36:32.200,00:36:33.840,"We can try again next week, huh?"
00:01:47.940,00:01:50.500,People say Valtteri is your number two driver.
00:01:50.600,00:01:51.660,Would you say that?
00:01:52.100,00:01:52.960,Is that fair?
00:01:56.680,00:01:58.160,They might.
00:02:54.800,00:02:56.200,The sauna is warm.
00:02:58.240,00:02:59.440,Balls out.
00:03:02.800,00:03:04.040,This is peaceful.
00:03:05.160,00:03:08.600,"Throwing water on the rocks, you relax straightaway."
00:03:13.560,00:03:15.600,How are you feeling about it?
00:03:16.600,00:03:22.920,"Of course, performance is a big thing, but… it's not only how good you are at driving."
00:03:24.000,00:03:26.120,But what can you do?
00:03:27.200,00:03:29.320,-That's just how it is. -That's just how it is.
00:03:34.240,00:03:39.200,"I believe, my gut feeling is that things will end up going well."
00:03:41.560,00:03:44.800,Now I just need to step on the accelerator bloody well.
00:04:03.440,00:04:06.280,-We shall find out. -We shall find out.
00:04:08.880,00:04:11.720,"-Enough Formula 1 stuff. -Yeah, definitely."
00:04:12.560,00:04:14.200,Let's just look at the swans.
00:04:40.520,00:04:41.720,Thank you.
00:04:59.880,00:05:01.880,"Valtteri, do you wanna do it, the four of us?"
00:05:02.560,00:05:04.680,"-No, be separate. -You want to be separate?"
00:05:04.760,00:05:06.400,I don't want any disease from you.
00:05:06.480,00:05:09.160,I haven't got any diseases… that you can catch airborne.
00:05:11.160,00:05:14.200,-Are we doing it in here? -Lewis said let's do it in here.
00:05:15.720,00:05:17.280,Why is he not in here?
00:05:17.360,00:05:20.440,He wants to sit in his room and do it through there.
00:05:22.280,00:05:23.760,Can you see everything?
00:05:28.460,00:05:30.040,"Yeah, let's get started."
00:06:20.000,00:06:21.200,Call ended.
00:06:39.640,00:06:40.840,They are pretty hot.
00:06:41.380,00:06:43.760,I'm kind of regretting the decision.
00:06:43.840,00:06:45.960,But I am committed to the cause.
00:07:57.160,00:07:58.200,2.9.
00:08:14.680,00:08:16.640,-That's fine. -Is it okay? Cool.
00:09:07.360,00:09:09.360,I was gonna go faster next lap.
00:09:09.440,00:09:11.960,Let's discuss it afterwards. We'll explain.
00:09:57.840,00:09:58.920,One more.
00:10:06.640,00:10:09.360,Do you think Valtteri can still be world champion?
00:10:28.520,00:10:30.720,Do you get nervous on qualifying day?
00:10:38.760,00:10:41.240,-I can't recommend the cycling here. -No?
00:10:41.320,00:10:44.320,"-Did you go to the mountains? -Yeah, then I got arrested."
00:10:44.400,00:10:45.640,-Arrested? -Yes.
00:10:46.200,00:10:50.880,"Apparently I entered a military area. So they stopped me, they kept my passport."
00:10:50.960,00:10:54.000,I got chased by a stray dog at one point.
00:10:54.080,00:10:55.160,Welcome to Russia.
00:11:27.200,00:11:29.720,Finally it's going to be a good weekend.
00:12:45.720,00:12:47.640,We've got Valtteri behind four seconds.
00:12:48.240,00:12:49.800,The circuit's all clear ahead.
00:12:50.320,00:12:51.440,Let's go.
00:13:05.760,00:13:07.560,"So tactics, we're gonna push."
00:13:16.480,00:13:18.040,The rear end feels good.
00:13:21.320,00:13:22.840,We're in a good position now.
00:13:27.000,00:13:29.480,I went too deep. Had a bit of a lockup.
00:13:41.400,00:13:43.440,-You're slower than Lewis. -Copy.
00:13:52.600,00:13:54.420,Push all the way to Turn 16.
00:13:56.320,00:13:57.520,Just keep the pace up.
00:13:58.640,00:14:00.240,Push hard now.
00:14:02.360,00:14:03.520,Final corner.
00:14:11.400,00:14:13.440,Nice work. That's provisional pole.
00:14:14.280,00:14:15.960,This will be your last push.
00:14:24.360,00:14:25.680,That's currently P2.
00:15:31.560,00:15:34.080,"Wow, that was a good lap."
00:15:43.080,00:15:44.400,Look how he towed him.
00:15:45.640,00:15:46.680,I'm sorry.
00:15:47.600,00:15:51.760,We need to be more responsive next time. That's just something we need to work on.
00:17:12.440,00:17:14.800,-What happened? -I wish I knew.
00:17:14.880,00:17:18.840,"I just didn't go quicker, so maybe I was just playing games, wanting to start third."
00:17:19.440,00:17:20.880,It's a good place to start.
00:17:20.960,00:17:24.080,It will give me an advantage against Lewis.
00:18:52.680,00:18:56.240,-I'm not slowing down for Nico. -Why is he not letting me through?
00:19:05.600,00:19:06.800,Nico hit me.
00:19:07.320,00:19:08.320,Nico's hit me.
00:19:37.760,00:19:38.760,He's already left?
00:19:38.840,00:19:41.080,-We do the longest days. -We do the longest days!
00:19:41.160,00:19:43.960,-We're always last to leave. -That's why we're number one.
00:19:53.600,00:19:54.920,Tomorrow's gonna be hard.
00:20:11.880,00:20:16.200,"-Shoot, man, we haven't skydived for ages. -Oh God, we have to do it."
00:20:16.280,00:20:18.840,-I'd like to do bobsleigh. -Bobsleigh's hardcore.
00:20:18.920,00:20:21.360,-You should do skeleton. -Hell no!
00:20:21.440,00:20:23.560,-Where you lay on the thing and go down? -Head first.
00:20:23.640,00:20:24.920,No fucking way.
00:20:25.000,00:20:26.120,You're nuts.
00:20:27.040,00:20:30.280,-It looks like so much fun. -It does not look fun at all.
00:20:45.160,00:20:46.280,"Yeah, pushing."
00:21:42.560,00:21:44.560,-Is Sochi for your liking? -Yeah.
00:21:55.160,00:21:56.960,Anything that I can get for you?
00:21:58.400,00:22:00.080,- Enjoy your breakfast.
00:23:18.180,00:23:19.440,Radio check Max.
00:23:19.520,00:23:22.800,"-Yeah. Radio check. -Straight through the pit lane, then."
00:23:30.760,00:23:32.520,Are you good at wheel guns?
00:23:33.000,00:23:36.360,I should have a go. I can't be worse than a team principal.
00:24:00.280,00:24:02.920,There's all rubber here. Can I go further out?
00:24:05.520,00:24:07.760,Leave enough room for cars to pass.
00:24:11.440,00:24:12.560,What is this?
00:24:13.720,00:24:15.120,To the end of the pit wall?
00:24:16.560,00:24:17.560,"Yeah, copy."
00:24:18.400,00:24:21.400,"Seems an odd thing to do on the pit wall, no?"
00:24:55.680,00:24:57.480,Okay. We can go to the grid now.
00:25:06.240,00:25:07.440,So cool the car.
00:25:16.760,00:25:18.480,All okay with the engine.
00:25:37.360,00:25:39.400,Hamilton stopped on the track.
00:25:39.480,00:25:41.040,-Did he? -Yeah.
00:25:41.120,00:25:44.160,I think he stopped on the track and made a practice start.
00:25:46.280,00:25:49.760,Surely they can't penalize you in a race for something that hasn't happened in the race?
00:25:49.840,00:25:51.280,That's got to just be a fine.
00:25:57.560,00:26:02.360,I like this national anthem. It reminds me of Rocky against Ivan Drago.
00:27:35.160,00:27:36.000,Are you okay?
00:27:56.160,00:27:58.760,So lights are out. You control the pace.
00:28:01.440,00:28:03.520,Very poor grip there.
00:28:13.320,00:28:14.960,-What is it? -Look.
00:28:16.960,00:28:18.040,Oh God.
00:28:30.240,00:28:32.360,Fuck! Is Lewis aware?
00:28:34.320,00:28:35.720,Tell him. Tell him.
00:28:50.720,00:28:53.520,"-Where's that in the rule book? -Copy, Lewis."
00:28:54.200,00:28:55.800,"Yeah, that's bullshit."
00:28:55.880,00:28:57.680,"Yeah, it's… It's shit."
00:28:59.280,00:29:05.120,So Lewis ahead has a ten-second penalty -Start closing up the gap to Lewis. -Copy.
00:29:10.040,00:29:12.080,"Simon, talk to me about vibration."
00:29:12.560,00:29:15.640,-It's still growing steadily lap on lap. -I'm gonna call Lewis.
00:29:15.720,00:29:17.960,We need to get him in as soon as we can.
00:29:26.680,00:29:28.200,Tires are still okay.
00:29:28.800,00:29:30.600,Do not stop me early. Do not.
00:29:31.640,00:29:34.120,"-OK, copy, Lewis. -Stand down, gents. Stand down."
00:30:00.360,00:30:03.840,"Lewis, that's the fastest lap. You need to maintain this pace."
00:30:08.320,00:30:12.280,-Safety critical vibrations. -We have to stop Lewis this lap.
00:30:14.000,00:30:16.880,"Sorry, Lewis, you need to box, box. Box, box."
00:30:32.440,00:30:36.040,Why did you have to serve it? Why isn't it added at the end of the race?
00:30:59.600,00:31:01.200,This is just ridiculous.
00:31:04.280,00:31:05.560,How far have I dropped back?
00:31:06.080,00:31:07.960,Currently down to P11.
00:31:22.560,00:31:25.440,"-Where's Lewis? -Lewis, currently P11."
00:31:53.000,00:31:57.040,"-Why did you stop me so early? -We'll have to have that chat later, Lewis."
00:31:57.120,00:31:59.420,We have Vettel ahead. Let's just get on with it.
00:32:02.040,00:32:03.520,"Hamilton, 0.4 behind."
00:32:04.040,00:32:05.640,An overtake is available.
00:32:15.320,00:32:20.040,"All cars ahead are yet to stop, so you are P3 on the road virtually."
00:32:31.960,00:32:33.920,"Okay, Lewis, so now P3."
00:32:34.800,00:32:36.720,"Verstappen, eight seconds ahead."
00:32:44.440,00:32:46.200,"How's the drivability, Max?"
00:32:46.280,00:32:49.920,"I'm trying, but it's not very easy to drive at the moment."
00:32:51.920,00:32:54.840,I've started to feel the left a little bit as well now.
00:32:55.360,00:32:57.040,"Verstappen, pace dropping off."
00:32:57.120,00:32:59.080,He's complaining about tires on radio.
00:32:59.800,00:33:02.400,"Tell him, You can do this. Just this one sentence."
00:33:21.760,00:33:24.000,-That's the fastest lap. -Yeah.
00:33:27.200,00:33:30.640,"I don't want to hear from you now, Bono. It doesn't make any difference."
00:33:47.120,00:33:49.120,Valtteri is two corners away.
00:33:49.880,00:33:52.800,Let's show our appreciation to a fantastic drive from him.
00:34:54.880,00:34:57.040,"-Lewis is not happy, is he? -No."
00:34:57.520,00:34:58.600,Good decision.
00:35:00.520,00:35:05.280,"For sure, he will do something again. He believes he can do whatever he wants."
00:35:05.920,00:35:08.360,Was it just you weren't aware of that regulation?
00:35:20.480,00:35:22.160,This is ridiculous.
00:35:22.240,00:35:25.960,Ron and I are going to the stewards. Just to make a point. We owe it to Lewis.
00:35:26.040,00:35:28.440,I don't want to just accept this.
00:35:41.960,00:35:43.960,It was extremely dangerous to do that.
00:35:44.040,00:35:48.960,It's not the first time somebody did a race start from a place that was different to the other ones.
00:35:49.440,00:35:52.000,"It was not an easy decision, honestly."
00:35:52.080,00:35:54.760,"Toto, we do not look at who he is."
00:35:54.840,00:35:59.360,"We look at the regulations and we apply… OK, gentlemen."
00:36:03.280,00:36:06.160,Stubborn. It is just talking against a wall.
00:36:47.440,00:36:49.080,"-See you, Toto. -See ya."
00:36:49.160,00:36:50.880,"-Happy? -Yeah, happy."
00:36:51.400,00:36:55.160,We need to be happy for a one and three. It's not a complete misery.
00:36:58.920,00:37:01.640,"We'll do the team victory in ten minutes, okay?"
00:37:02.080,00:37:03.640,Feels good.
00:37:12.080,00:37:33.760,"Look at this. The engineers are gone, so… Traditions."
00:38:13.400,00:38:15.720,"Racing Point, I don't understand."
00:38:19.080,00:38:22.160,You always think about your future. I want to do the maximum.
00:38:22.240,00:38:24.120,I don't want to have any regrets.
00:00:17.440,00:00:19.440,"Lewis. Sometimes, he sings."
00:00:25.360,00:00:27.520,I think he's a better driver than singer.
00:00:34.000,00:00:42.600,"No. I think people say that, when Netflix is around, things go bad, but, you know, it's just… Um, how do you say? It's just a bad coincidence."
00:00:53.280,00:00:54.480,one of the best ever.
00:00:54.560,00:00:56.840,It's pretty tough.
00:00:59.200,00:01:01.920,they expect Valtteri to move out of Lewis's way.
00:01:03.840,00:01:08.760,It's a Mercedes one-two again. Bottas finishes second.
00:01:08.840,00:01:11.720,"And the winner, Lewis Hamilton!"
00:01:15.280,00:01:19.680,"but if your teammate wins and you are second, you feel like you lose."
00:01:27.240,00:01:29.120,It's a hard thing to kind of grasp.
00:01:29.640,00:01:33.640,"what you've, you know, what I've done, but it's, for sure, hard for Valtteri."
00:01:34.280,00:01:36.280,He wants to be world champion.
00:01:39.560,00:01:42.440,but I want to prove that I'm not just a number two.
00:01:43.680,00:01:47.880,"-Valtteri was such a sensational wingman. -Well, first of all, wingman hurts."
00:01:54.720,00:01:56.600,"They can't hear your question, right?"
00:02:26.240,00:02:28.800,"Most of us, we're kind of bit of lone wolves."
00:02:29.440,00:02:34.040,"Even though it's a team sport, you have a massive team behind, in the car, you are there alone."
00:02:47.000,00:02:51.280,Finland is a pretty good contrast to the Formula 1 world.
00:02:51.920,00:02:53.280,There's no pressure.
00:02:59.520,00:03:01.040,"Aye, aye, aye."
00:03:39.280,00:03:40.120,Yeah.
00:03:47.800,00:03:52.800,"There's many couch commentators in the sport, but I don't let it get to me."
00:03:52.880,00:03:56.440,I know what I'm still aiming for and what I'm capable of.
00:03:57.320,00:04:02.560,And Lewis knows how hungry I am for the wins and for my first title.
00:04:24.320,00:04:26.640,and Sochi is Russia's most popular resort.
00:04:26.720,00:04:29.360,It's the country's unofficial summer capital.
00:04:29.440,00:04:30.520,It's glorious.
00:04:30.600,00:04:34.080,"There's beaches, there's theme parks, roller coasters, all sorts."
00:04:39.560,00:04:40.480,Hello.
00:04:47.920,00:04:53.640,Lewis Hamilton seeks to join Michael Schumacher as a 91-times Grand Prix victor.
00:04:53.720,00:04:56.640,The all-time record is up for grabs in Sochi.
00:05:24.320,00:05:26.080,Nope. Just black.
00:05:30.120,00:05:34.600,"Um, as you can tell, we have Netflix with us this weekend."
00:05:35.120,00:05:37.800,"Uh, we'll try and offer pretty broad access."
00:05:37.880,00:05:44.600,"We can talk about certain things, but, obviously, the special systems we're gonna keep hidden away from them."
00:05:49.240,00:05:54.240,that you made the list of the 100 most influential people in Time magazine.
00:05:54.320,00:05:56.520,"-Congratulations, by the way. -Cheers, man."
00:06:08.200,00:06:12.600,Everyone knows the name Lewis Hamilton. Not as many people know Valtteri Bottas.
00:06:13.280,00:06:17.800,But I feel my strength against him is that I want the title more than him.
00:06:26.760,00:06:29.840,The two drivers actually are just so different.
00:06:29.920,00:06:34.280,It's not about schmoozing with each other. It's about having respect for each other.
00:06:55.520,00:06:58.560,More like the typical Finnish character.
00:06:58.640,00:07:02.400,"It's always been quite a strong track for me, so we definitely expect to win."
00:07:02.480,00:07:08.680,"And having these diverse characters is a strength of the team, as long as our objectives are the same."
00:07:08.760,00:07:14.200,"Looking ahead to this weekend, how excited are you about potentially equaling Michael Schumacher's record?"
00:07:14.280,00:07:18.520,"It's very, very surreal to think that I'm that close to Michael."
00:07:18.600,00:07:21.680,"But it's not one of my favorite tracks, so it'll be a real challenge."
00:07:21.760,00:07:28.200,"I don't know where we're gonna stand, but we've got to work very hard to keep this guy behind."
00:07:30.280,00:07:33.120,He's about to break a big record in the Formula 1 world.
00:07:33.200,00:07:36.560,"As a teammate, what is it that makes him so hard to race against?"
00:07:37.160,00:07:41.080,"First of all, for sure, I try to avoid him breaking that record yet."
00:07:41.160,00:07:43.920,Yeah. I just wanna beat him.
00:07:45.120,00:07:46.080,Thank you.
00:08:10.240,00:08:14.160,"maybe unconsciously, they have number one and number two driver."
00:08:20.960,00:08:25.040,Are we giving equal treatment to Lewis and Valtteri?
00:08:35.920,00:08:39.040,"At Sochi 2018, that was a pretty tough race."
00:08:42.880,00:08:45.640,where we had to make decisions that are uncomfortable.
00:08:52.040,00:08:56.600,There's Toto Wolff pressing the button. Clearly his call.
00:08:58.080,00:09:04.720,"They needed to put one car, in terms of the championship, between Hamilton and Vettel, and Bottas had to be the man."
00:09:20.160,00:09:22.160,"Yeah, that was tough. Tough to accept."
00:09:22.760,00:09:24.720,I understand how difficult it was for Valtteri.
00:09:24.800,00:09:27.280,He did a fantastic job today and deserved to win.
00:09:33.360,00:09:35.680,"Honestly, I was thinking, Why do I do this?"
00:09:36.520,00:09:39.280,"I was even thinking of quitting, of giving up."
00:09:40.280,00:09:43.400,"Straight after the race, I said I would not do it again."
00:10:09.440,00:10:14.720,"I think Valtteri, in his mind, has no doubt that he can be."
00:10:16.240,00:10:21.440,But having Lewis as your teammate is probably the hardest thing that you can have.
00:10:21.520,00:10:25.440,He could beat Michael Schumacher's 90-race win record.
00:10:25.520,00:10:27.640,"Doesn't get any worse, I guess."
00:10:32.040,00:10:32.880,No.
00:10:58.600,00:11:03.480,"We're here at the Olympic Park, host of the 2014 Winter Olympics."
00:11:03.560,00:11:06.960,"And, for the first time this season, the fans are back!"
00:11:07.040,00:11:12.440,"There are 30,000 here today, ready for some fast action on a 3.6 mile circuit."
00:11:30.840,00:11:35.200,A critical part of every qualifying session is a front-row lockout.
00:11:35.840,00:11:39.760,Being able to start first and second on the grid protects the driver on pole.
00:11:44.680,00:11:47.400,the best position to start is either first or second.
00:11:47.920,00:11:52.520,"But I think actually, on this track, to win the race, you want to start either first or third."
00:11:52.600,00:11:55.400,It's nearly one kilometer into the first corner.
00:11:55.920,00:12:00.880,"If you are following a car, it's less air to push away, so you go faster on the straight."
00:12:01.360,00:12:02.640,That's a huge advantage.
00:12:33.280,00:12:39.320,"Decided by those finite margins of a hundredth, a tenth of a second."
00:14:29.520,00:14:32.560,It's not done yet though. Max Verstappen has to do his lap.
00:14:33.880,00:14:37.120,What's this? Bottas is giving Verstappen a massive tow.
00:14:37.200,00:14:40.120,This is going to give the Red Bull a huge advantage.
00:14:52.160,00:14:54.600,is punching a hole in the air.
00:14:54.680,00:14:59.080,"There's less wind resistance, which means that you can drive faster."
00:14:59.160,00:15:01.440,Verstappen behind. Don't give him a tow.
00:15:01.520,00:15:04.880,Giving a rival a tow is like giving them an extra 20 horsepower.
00:15:09.560,00:15:11.920,"if you don't make pole, you need to start third."
00:15:12.760,00:15:18.480,"To beat Lewis, I always race hard, fair, but, sometimes, it's like, Fuck it."
00:15:27.840,00:15:29.240,Verstappen's on the front row!
00:15:53.800,00:16:00.200,"Today's the day I'm gonna stop being a team member here, and I'm gonna start putting myself first a little more often?"
00:16:02.800,00:16:05.200,and Verstappen can thank you for the tow.
00:16:08.280,00:16:12.320,on the weekend that he's aiming to equal Michael Schumacher's record.
00:16:13.240,00:16:16.120,But it isn't a Mercedes lockout on the front row.
00:16:16.200,00:16:19.800,Verstappen starts second. Valtteri Bottas starts third.
00:16:23.440,00:16:28.200,"And, all of a sudden, Max Verstappen is splitting the Mercedes and starting on the front row."
00:16:28.280,00:16:30.640,It raised a lot of eyebrows up and down the paddock.
00:16:33.080,00:16:35.280,That's not the reason he's in front of us.
00:16:35.360,00:16:38.000,The reason he's in front of us is we did a bad lap.
00:16:41.000,00:16:43.720,Both things contributed to not being P2.
00:16:45.600,00:16:48.320,We are just trying to come as close to perfection as we can.
00:16:48.400,00:16:52.440,But sometimes the drivers' objectives are different to the objectives of the team.
00:16:58.000,00:16:59.960,Everyone knew third is better than second.
00:17:00.040,00:17:03.240,"If I did it on purpose, only I know."
00:17:04.320,00:17:08.000,But I would have not made it into this sport if I wasn't selfish at times.
00:17:29.120,00:17:30.320,Maybe it's tactical.
00:17:31.640,00:17:34.480,"Don't know how or why he would do that, so, um, yeah."
00:17:38.440,00:17:41.480,It's so important to have the support of your teammate.
00:17:41.560,00:17:45.880,There was a period of time the guy that has been my teammate has been my best friend.
00:17:45.960,00:17:50.640,"But when you work your life to win and only one of you can win, it brings a lot of friction."
00:18:05.120,00:18:08.200,"To win a world championship, I dedicated my whole life to it."
00:18:08.280,00:18:12.320,"For me, it makes it all the more sweeter that Lewis was the guy I managed to beat."
00:18:14.480,00:18:16.880,I've known Lewis since I'm 13 years old.
00:18:16.960,00:18:19.680,We were teammates in go-karting and best friends at the time.
00:18:22.680,00:18:25.840,-Drive smooth and calm and collective. -I need to finish at the front.
00:18:26.360,00:18:29.720,"Just be careful, then finally just give it everything. Full speed."
00:18:40.920,00:18:45.480,"Imagine if, one day, we can be in the leading Formula 1 team, fighting for world championships."
00:18:45.560,00:18:47.320,Totally unrealistic.
00:18:47.920,00:18:49.680,"Then, all of a sudden, it happened."
00:19:02.760,00:19:04.680,"With Lewis, it just went too far."
00:19:09.200,00:19:11.920,This is an absolutely unacceptable race for us.
00:19:12.000,00:19:14.040,I agree. That is unacceptable.
00:19:14.120,00:19:15.560,It's probably best I go now.
00:19:18.680,00:19:20.200,to manage the animosity.
00:19:20.960,00:19:23.360,"We, as a team, cannot let it happen again."
00:19:28.960,00:19:31.240,Everybody has self-doubt. Lewis has self-doubt as well.
00:19:31.320,00:19:34.200,You need to amplify that. You can force him into mistakes.
00:19:55.000,00:19:56.040,Mm-hmm.
00:20:00.960,00:20:06.920,It's been a real challenge to raise my level each year and deliver without making mistakes.
00:20:07.520,00:20:11.800,"In that battle you have with your mind, you've got to stay calm, stay in the zone."
00:20:46.360,00:20:49.040,-See you tomorrow. -See you tomorrow. Bye. One of ours.
00:20:55.840,00:20:57.920,is the main focus that we have now.
00:20:58.520,00:20:59.960,It's not great pictures.
00:21:01.120,00:21:02.800,Undermines my authority.
00:21:05.840,00:21:11.880,"But this weekend, it's also important for Valtteri to make up some points for his chance to win the championship."
00:21:13.520,00:21:15.320,So you never know what to expect.
00:21:16.000,00:21:17.960,"That's the race director, by the way."
00:21:18.480,00:21:20.800,He's the one everybody complains to.
00:21:20.880,00:21:22.200,Exactly. Including you.
00:21:22.280,00:21:23.480,Wait tomorrow.
00:21:24.360,00:21:26.040,I'll be on the intercom with you.
00:21:44.640,00:21:45.680,Good vodka.
00:21:47.200,00:21:48.160,Russian karaoke.
00:21:49.920,00:21:52.960,-Nearly missed the flight the next day. -Yeah. It was 2015.
00:22:00.160,00:22:02.560,Did you get a bit happy last night on social?
00:22:02.640,00:22:04.480,"Yeah, so I saw this comment..."
00:22:04.560,00:22:05.960,What did he comment?
00:22:06.040,00:22:07.960,He was basically saying something negative.
00:22:08.040,00:22:11.480,"Lewis will still beat you, You're still shit, basically that."
00:22:11.560,00:22:16.440,"Yeah. Then I just said, If I had your mentality, I would have given up many times."
00:22:18.040,00:22:22.360,"The evening before the race, a comment on social media went under my skin."
00:22:23.000,00:22:25.960,People forget that people have feelings and are real people.
00:22:27.920,00:22:34.400,"But turning anger into motivation and will to win, that's very healthy, if you can control that."
00:22:35.440,00:22:39.320,"If I listened too much to criticism, that would be a killer."
00:22:43.200,00:22:48.280,"The translation is… Dogs are barking, but the train keeps going."
00:22:59.760,00:23:01.960,Track temperature's gonna be over 40 degrees.
00:23:09.000,00:23:11.560,To equal Michael Schumacher's record.
00:23:15.360,00:23:17.000,until at least the next race.
00:23:50.360,00:23:55.720,There is a designated area to do a practice start at the end of the pit lane.
00:23:55.800,00:24:00.200,"Everybody that goes onto the grid can do a practice start, but it has to be in that block."
00:24:24.320,00:24:28.280,"And I'm always looking to maximize every opportunity, plain and simple."
00:24:34.480,00:24:38.480,the team okayed for Lewis to go down there and do it.
00:24:44.720,00:24:47.680,What Lewis Hamilton did put others at risk.
00:24:48.960,00:24:55.080,"If he'd launched himself out when people were already coming out of the pit lane, there could've been a massive crash."
00:24:58.680,00:25:05.440,"Lewis wanted to maximize the practice start before the race, so he could nail it on the race start itself."
00:25:08.800,00:25:11.640,He knows that sometimes the pole can be less of an advantage.
00:25:11.720,00:25:16.680,And maybe it played games in Lewis's head.
00:25:19.040,00:25:21.680,Everyone makes mistakes in this sport. Even the best.
00:25:22.800,00:25:23.760,Even Lewis.
00:25:27.640,00:25:31.120,for doing a practice start outside of the designated area.
00:25:31.200,00:25:32.720,He's being investigated.
00:25:35.080,00:25:36.480,for his race this afternoon.
00:25:49.840,00:25:51.680,-That's got to just be a fine. -Yeah.
00:26:16.080,00:26:19.320,He needs to be ahead of Hamilton going into Turn 2.
00:26:19.400,00:26:23.760,"Everyone's expecting Lewis to win, but everyone cracks. Also, Lewis."
00:26:23.840,00:26:28.040,I need to keep putting the pressure on him. I need to keep him on his toes.
00:26:33.400,00:26:35.280,"It's very, very surreal."
00:26:37.320,00:26:40.160,Lewis Hamilton equals Michael Schumacher's record?
00:26:40.240,00:26:44.280,You've got to be able to block it all out and focus on the one goal.
00:26:44.360,00:26:46.520,To win the race. It's intense.
00:27:10.800,00:27:13.320,Bottas is going round the outside of Hamilton!
00:27:16.400,00:27:17.680,"Oh, but he's run wide!"
00:27:17.760,00:27:20.520,Hamilton gets back in front. Bottas in second.
00:27:21.400,00:27:24.080,Carlos Sainz is in the wall. That's a big crash.
00:27:47.400,00:27:52.880,"into the first corner, taking it to Hamilton, making him feel uncomfortable, like Rosberg did in 2016."
00:27:52.960,00:27:56.080,But Lewis still managed to hold it beautifully.
00:28:06.760,00:28:09.560,He's still under investigation for that practice start.
00:28:22.000,00:28:26.400,"for the race leader, Lewis Hamilton, for practice start violations."
00:28:42.440,00:28:44.320,for the practice start infringements.
00:28:46.520,00:28:50.120,"Sorry, the practice start, going to the grid, got a ten-second penalty."
00:29:51.400,00:29:55.600,A full second quicker than his last flying lap. He's on the march.
00:29:55.680,00:29:59.760,Six tenths quicker than Bottas. Over a second quicker than Verstappen.
00:30:21.800,00:30:26.360,"This will be a ten-second wait, which will feel like it's forever for him."
00:30:41.280,00:30:44.920,Lewis is serving his ten-second penalty. Now show us your pace.
00:30:45.000,00:30:45.960,Copy.
00:31:10.320,00:31:13.600,will take a lot of effort from Hamilton if he's gonna achieve it.
00:31:14.320,00:31:16.760,He's coming out behind Sebastian Vettel.
00:31:27.520,00:31:31.320,What can Valtteri Bottas do now that he's got a clear track in front of him?
00:31:33.280,00:31:35.520,Good job. This pace is very good.
00:31:40.800,00:31:41.720,It only helps me.
00:31:42.520,00:31:45.640,And I decided that there's no way I'm gonna give up this win.
00:31:57.120,00:31:59.240,We have Vettel ahead. Let's get on with it.
00:32:39.560,00:32:41.360,It's all about hunting down Verstappen.
00:33:25.720,00:33:27.120,Valtteri now has fastest lap.
00:33:34.480,00:33:37.360,but it will not be that 91st win.
00:33:42.600,00:33:45.160,Valtteri Bottas through the final couple of corners.
00:33:59.760,00:34:01.000,Fuck yeah!
00:34:01.080,00:34:03.280,"Yes, mate! Get in there!"
00:34:06.640,00:34:09.160,who hits back in the drivers' championship.
00:34:10.560,00:34:14.880,"I think, again, it's a nice moment to thank my critics."
00:34:14.960,00:34:17.360,"To whom it may concern, fuck you."
00:34:25.040,00:34:27.160,and another super drive from him.
00:34:40.960,00:34:47.200,His chances to match Schumacher's record undone before the five red lights even went out.
00:35:12.120,00:35:15.080,"They're trying to stop me, aren't they? So it is what it is."
00:35:15.600,00:35:20.400,"I mean, that penalty was very drastic, very radical, very over-the-top."
00:35:31.960,00:35:34.680,"You know, I was that kid that everyone wanted to beat."
00:35:35.160,00:35:39.880,"And they couldn't beat me, so they would find other ways to beat me."
00:36:10.560,00:36:11.760,Lewis Hamilton!
00:36:15.960,00:36:20.680,podium is less important than seeing the stewards immediately and making our argument.
00:36:20.760,00:36:24.920,And I think Valtteri himself doesn't care whether he's being given credit or not.
00:36:30.600,00:36:33.440,"Beating Lewis, you know, it is so satisfying."
00:36:34.000,00:36:40.600,"Everyone was expecting Lewis to match Michael in the race wins, but I want to delay that process as far as possible."
00:36:56.160,00:36:57.040,See ya.
00:37:12.080,00:37:23.760,"Look at this. The engineers are gone, so… Every single driver would do anything to get into my seat."
00:37:24.440,00:37:29.640,"But it's not easy sometimes, or most of the time, when you are against Lewis."
00:37:30.160,00:37:31.680,It takes a lot of energy.
00:37:36.400,00:37:43.240,"There's a reason why Lewis is in this team, but, you know, there must be also a reason why I am in this team."
00:37:44.840,00:37:46.040,I hate to be second.
00:37:47.240,00:37:48.920,I'm not just the number two.
00:38:01.720,00:38:04.280,They had an unfair advantage that the FIA took away.
00:38:04.880,00:38:07.600,We are in this position because we deserve to be.
00:38:07.680,00:38:09.280,I guess he was pissed off.
00:38:15.800,00:38:18.120,Our competitors simply didn't do a good enough job.
00:00:07.280,00:00:11.680,"So, this is the helmet that I will race in this year's Italian Grand Prix."
00:00:11.760,00:00:19.040,The best feature about this helmet for this weekend is that I will be able to take my mask off as soon as I'm wearing the helmet.
00:00:24.760,00:00:29.600,We cannot be too funny considering the performance after Belgium.
00:00:29.680,00:00:35.520,-Says who? -We. Because… I think you should be funny if you look at our performance.
00:00:36.680,00:00:39.600,"So, is that the credo for this weekend, Don't laugh?"
00:00:39.680,00:00:41.840,-No! -No jokes?
00:01:37.880,00:01:39.000,Not again!
00:01:42.680,00:01:44.520,"Ah, it's so frustrating!"
00:01:59.000,00:02:01.960,"I'll hang in there, but you know that you've messed up."
00:02:31.680,00:02:33.320,It's going to be a disaster.
00:02:37.020,00:02:39.840,Can we talk a little bit about the season so far?
00:02:39.920,00:02:41.920,"It's been pretty difficult, right?"
00:02:43.520,00:02:44.360,Why?
00:03:11.080,00:03:11.920,Grazie.
00:03:14.000,00:03:16.000,Netflix again? Oh my God.
00:03:29.040,00:03:31.600,Their rooms can't be smaller than ours.
00:03:32.760,00:03:36.800,"Ferrari had bad seasons in the past, as well as this year."
00:03:38.120,00:03:43.760,"Yes, we are in a difficult moment, but Monza is a very historic Grand Prix."
00:03:44.560,00:03:48.720,"Obviously, being in Italy, it's, uh, the one which counts."
00:03:48.800,00:03:51.320,"-Is everything okay? -Yes, fine."
00:03:51.400,00:03:57.280,"Let me say, you may lose a season, but if you are winning Monza, at least you have saved your season."
00:03:58.560,00:04:01.680,I am going to read out some of the media questions.
00:04:01.760,00:04:04.840,-Yes. -This is a question from Vanzini.
00:04:04.920,00:04:08.560,What is the key word right now?
00:04:08.640,00:04:10.200,What do you suggest?
00:04:11.160,00:04:13.080,"Well, the same as always."
00:04:14.440,00:04:16.240,"No, I think determination is better."
00:04:16.320,00:04:20.520,"Yes, I would say we have a lot of determination."
00:04:21.140,00:04:22.220,More than usual.
00:04:22.320,00:04:23.160,Yes.
00:04:24.600,00:04:34.480,"Certainly, we understand that it's a very difficult moment, but I think that the frustrations we've got, um, we need to transform that into determination."
00:04:45.160,00:04:48.760,"Certainly, we know what we need to improve."
00:04:48.840,00:04:50.560,I think there is no doubt.
00:04:50.640,00:04:58.560,What's important is to stay focused and really to try to work very hard and to transform any frustration into determination.
00:05:15.880,00:05:18.160,Do you think it will be a bit like last year?
00:05:20.400,00:05:22.200,I think it will be a mess.
00:06:28.280,00:06:30.960,That's four post-races that I'm not speaking at all.
00:07:13.960,00:07:23.840,"I think that Seb is a very experienced four-times world champion, but I think even for Seb, it's always a continuous learning process."
00:07:26.240,00:07:28.280,Charles is very young.
00:07:28.360,00:07:29.600,He is very fast.
00:07:29.680,00:07:32.600,He is very consistent.
00:07:32.680,00:07:38.400,"He is good in battling, defending, attacking."
00:07:38.480,00:07:45.640,"So, in order to develop our team for this season, there is not a number-one driver in Ferrari."
00:08:30.680,00:08:34.920,"Okay, so, Charles, when will you launch your clothing collection?"
00:09:24.840,00:09:27.080,Seb has been with us a few years already.
00:09:27.160,00:09:35.360,"I think we all love Seb because he's part of our family, but we felt the necessity to look ahead, to look forward."
00:09:36.760,00:09:40.840,It's like trying to create foundations for our long-term future.
00:09:59.780,00:10:01.780,Would it make you insecure somehow?
00:10:38.760,00:10:43.160,I heard that telling him so early would have created a lot of difficulties.
00:10:44.120,00:10:48.600,But I think whatever were the concerns people were raising were the wrong concerns.
00:11:08.480,00:11:10.040,"Go on, Charles!"
00:11:18.200,00:11:20.360,"-Hey, guys. -Thank you, Charles."
00:11:20.440,00:11:21.680,"You're number one, bro!"
00:11:27.800,00:11:30.000,"Go on, you're the best!"
00:11:42.800,00:11:45.520,-Did you sleep well? -Very well.
00:12:01.640,00:12:03.720,"Go on Charles, Ferrari!"
00:12:03.800,00:12:05.280,"Hello, thank you."
00:12:05.880,00:12:09.120,"Go on, you're the best! Kick his ass!"
00:12:09.200,00:12:11.960,"Hi, guys. Thanks."
00:12:13.440,00:12:15.680,Hello. Hi. I'm sorry.
00:12:25.400,00:12:27.960,-Let's see what today has in store. -Let's see.
00:13:40.480,00:13:42.360,Don't send me into too much traffic.
00:13:42.440,00:13:43.600,Copy.
00:13:51.280,00:13:52.640,Seb. He overtook me now.
00:13:52.720,00:13:55.680,I don't understand why I went out in front of him.
00:14:09.920,00:14:12.480,Mode charge. Mode charge.
00:14:12.560,00:14:13.880,Track is clear behind.
00:14:26.840,00:14:30.000,-The car is so hard to drive. -Copy. Understood.
00:14:31.320,00:14:33.680,We aren't doing well on the long runs.
00:14:36.840,00:14:38.160,So difficult.
00:14:38.240,00:14:39.600,"Ah, fuck's sake."
00:14:41.920,00:14:45.120,"At the moment, you are P11."
00:14:47.080,00:14:48.240,We are so slow.
00:15:06.080,00:15:07.360,Best I can do.
00:15:08.320,00:15:09.440,The best I can do.
00:15:27.200,00:15:28.640,Any cars around me?
00:15:28.720,00:15:30.640,"No, we are in a good slot."
00:15:31.480,00:15:33.120,Hamilton 3.3 in front.
00:15:33.200,00:15:35.040,Constant speed 200.
00:15:37.240,00:15:39.480,There was a chance to do better here.
00:15:43.600,00:15:46.840,"For your info, there's a big traffic jam out there."
00:15:48.800,00:15:50.440,Let's talk about it after.
00:15:57.560,00:15:59.960,"If you need to overtake people, we will."
00:16:00.680,00:16:04.400,A similar queue to that you had on your way back from holiday.
00:16:09.480,00:16:11.520,Is there a gap I can get through?
00:16:12.040,00:16:13.880,Too much traffic.
00:16:19.040,00:16:21.840,It will be mode push for last corner. Mode push.
00:16:48.040,00:16:49.840,Shit. What a mess.
00:17:04.040,00:17:07.240,"-I guess that's it. -Yeah, it is. P17."
00:18:01.640,00:18:02.480,No.
00:18:03.360,00:18:07.200,"I was in the middle of the mess, so there was no point to do it."
00:18:09.120,00:18:10.280,Yeah.
00:18:11.000,00:18:12.960,"That's what it was, a very short day."
00:18:37.840,00:18:39.920,-The pole's above your head. -What?
00:18:40.000,00:18:41.720,You have a mic above your head.
00:18:41.800,00:18:44.120,"But yeah, it's not easy."
00:18:45.600,00:18:47.280,I don't know how it will be tomorrow.
00:18:49.040,00:18:52.640,"-Well, yeah, look at Vettel. -Yeah."
00:18:52.720,00:18:54.560,He didn't do the last lap.
00:18:56.960,00:18:58.720,"It's okay, they can't read our lips."
00:18:59.800,00:19:02.880,"No, but be careful, you have a mic above your head."
00:19:11.440,00:19:13.480,We missed many opportunities.
00:19:13.560,00:19:15.280,Certainly the pressure was there.
00:19:16.040,00:19:18.720,"Obviously, the car is not as good as we would have wished."
00:19:18.800,00:19:22.160,I think Seb's got some difficulties with the car.
00:19:22.240,00:19:23.560,Lack of confidence.
00:19:24.440,00:19:26.640,And Charles' car was not performing.
00:19:26.720,00:19:31.080,"No grip, so, you know, difficult to really be fast around the lap."
00:19:31.160,00:19:33.400,"So, we had a poor Quali, very poor."
00:19:46.440,00:19:49.680,"Honestly, I think there is a lot of bullshit around it."
00:19:49.760,00:19:51.720,-Yeah. -A lot of rumors.
00:19:51.800,00:19:54.840,It's very simple. There have been never a breach of regulations.
00:21:22.840,00:21:26.120,"Let me know if you can go faster, question."
00:21:27.160,00:21:28.480,I don't think I can.
00:21:43.800,00:21:45.000,How was that?
00:22:45.520,00:22:52.400,"They don't have the power that they had before, that's clear, and they don't seem to be in a happy place at the moment."
00:23:39.200,00:23:45.560,Some of the team principals have suggested that the 2019 car or engine wasn't legal.
00:23:46.640,00:23:49.080,"Honestly, I don't think there is much to add."
00:23:49.160,00:23:50.400,The point is closed.
00:24:14.320,00:24:17.480,I'm having a romantic conversation with my girlfriend. You can't record this.
00:24:43.040,00:24:44.640,Okay. Okay.
00:24:44.720,00:24:46.240,We can see you now. Perfetto.
00:24:50.480,00:24:51.960,They are coming from there.
00:24:52.040,00:26:16.800,"They are just there now, so if you want to film them… Seb leaving Ferrari, what's going on there?"
00:27:42.040,00:27:44.000,Let's hope he doesn't lose motivation.
00:27:44.080,00:27:46.000,"Yes, we need to keep him focused."
00:27:47.520,00:27:56.480,"As a team principal, my challenge certainly is make sure that the external comments are not affecting the morale of the team."
00:27:58.720,00:28:00.840,It was a very difficult Quali.
00:28:01.560,00:28:02.920,I understand...
00:28:04.560,00:28:10.600,"the disappointment of the people around, but more important to stay focused."
00:28:16.720,00:28:18.240,Okay. Back of the grid.
00:28:20.760,00:28:22.040,And radio check.
00:28:23.200,00:28:25.360,"Yeah. One, two, radio check okay."
00:28:48.520,00:28:50.320,Ferrari's not so good in the straight anymore.
00:28:50.400,00:28:52.200,-Unbelievable! -Fucking hell.
00:28:54.760,00:28:56.400,"And radio check, Charles."
00:29:05.160,00:29:07.000,Radio check. Can you hear me?
00:29:12.760,00:29:14.120,Radio check.
00:29:14.200,00:29:15.920,Whoa. Wasn't plugged in.
00:29:17.080,00:29:18.080,No problem.
00:29:35.960,00:29:38.280,I think the emotion was going up.
00:29:39.240,00:29:40.400,The pressure was there.
00:29:41.480,00:29:42.480,No doubt.
00:29:44.720,00:29:47.200,Because we knew that Monza was important for us.
00:30:41.440,00:30:43.480,"Russell, 0.7 behind."
00:30:44.520,00:30:45.360,Copy.
00:30:51.280,00:30:52.320,DRS enabled.
00:30:53.360,00:30:55.320,Vettel does not have DRS.
00:30:56.160,00:30:57.240,"Yeah, copy."
00:30:58.680,00:31:02.760,And we are very hot on the left-hand side of the brakes.
00:31:02.840,00:31:03.880,Rear left.
00:31:04.680,00:31:06.240,"Russell, 0.5 behind."
00:31:06.840,00:31:08.480,Distance!
00:31:15.520,00:31:18.760,Vettel has smoking from behind. I'm not sure if he's dropping oil.
00:31:21.520,00:31:23.760,"-Something wrong, the rear left. -Copy."
00:31:23.840,00:31:26.520,You need to cool down the rears if you can.
00:31:40.200,00:31:42.400,Brakes failed. The brakes failed.
00:31:42.840,00:31:44.080,Brakes failed.
00:31:44.160,00:31:46.000,Oh God!
00:31:50.840,00:31:53.560,No more brake pedal. Brake line exploded.
00:31:53.640,00:31:55.560,I can bring the car back if you want.
00:31:56.680,00:31:59.400,We are always in the middle of any crisis.
00:32:24.520,00:32:27.480,"For Seb, it has been certainly frustrating."
00:32:28.000,00:32:35.680,"It's the most important race of the season and I think that whoever is a Ferrari driver, the dream is to win in Monza."
00:32:56.480,00:32:58.680,"Gap to Räikkönen in front, 0.6."
00:32:59.920,00:33:00.760,Copy.
00:33:45.840,00:33:49.280,We need to close the gap. We need to close the gap now.
00:33:50.800,00:33:54.000,We are not where we expected to be. We are not where we want to be.
00:33:58.400,00:34:00.560,Try to maximize full throttle.
00:34:02.840,00:34:06.200,"I'm… I'm struggling, guys."
00:34:27.200,00:34:28.320,Are you okay?
00:34:33.680,00:34:35.720,Charles? Can you hear me?
00:34:41.080,00:34:45.040,Ah… Fuck!
00:35:07.200,00:35:12.560,"I'm sorry, but I… Honestly, I struggled so much with the balance."
00:35:12.640,00:35:13.840,Fuck!
00:35:15.400,00:35:16.240,Sorry.
00:36:18.680,00:36:23.120,It was a difficult weekend which concluded even in the worst way.
00:36:24.640,00:36:28.400,"Obviously, we are all unhappy and disappointed."
00:36:36.160,00:36:37.800,We are very united.
00:36:38.600,00:36:42.400,I don't think there is even tensions inside the team.
00:36:48.880,00:36:51.520,I think that I can feel the team behind me.
00:36:51.600,00:36:52.880,Very committed.
00:36:52.960,00:36:55.920,"Now, it's down to us to prove that we are capable."
00:37:41.480,00:37:44.760,Ferrari has been always there since the very start.
00:37:45.280,00:37:48.840,Never stopping since 1950 when the F1 started.
00:37:49.400,00:37:57.680,"I think whatever difficulties we've got at the moment, it's important to celebrate because we are celebrating an entire history and a fantastic milestone."
00:37:58.200,00:38:01.400,"And if you've got such a history, somehow you are special."
00:39:07.120,00:39:13.560,"Okay, well, of course, the big news we all know now that Sebastian has a seat and a team for next year and beyond."
00:39:13.640,00:39:14.800,And beyond?
00:39:16.880,00:39:18.800,-Big news this morning. -Good.
00:39:19.640,00:39:30.560,"Good to have you around. We have done a post for you, saying… No, not Thank you, Silvia, it's all of us."
00:39:30.640,00:39:35.560,"Now, in terms of the timing of the announcement, Sebastian."
00:39:35.640,00:39:41.040,"We had quite a lot of people say, Sebastian, you know, announced this on this day, and everything."
00:39:41.120,00:39:52.360,"Of course, we believe it was triggered by last night's announcement from Perez, which came out so late. It was obviously a last-minute thing, so this is our position when we get asked."
00:39:52.440,00:39:55.360,-Yeah. It's the truth as well. -Okay.
00:40:08.880,00:40:17.440,"So, on my side, I have some information about Saturday evening, the event that we will have in Firenze."
00:40:18.200,00:40:27.840,"It's mandatory, guys, to be sharp because we will have a lot of important Ferrari family guests there, so we cannot really be late."
00:41:15.520,00:41:20.480,I think Ferrari has always proved to be capable of reacting to the difficulties.
00:41:20.560,00:41:24.280,We know that we need to turn that into determination.
00:41:24.800,00:41:29.240,"We are still investing in the future, committed of creating solid foundations."
00:41:46.480,00:41:48.840,Ferrari is a legendary brand.
00:41:48.920,00:41:51.480,Ferrari have always been part of motor racing.
00:41:51.560,00:41:54.680,"Ferrari is somehow unique, and Ferrari is a family."
00:41:54.760,00:41:57.240,"And being a family, somehow, it's a passion."
00:41:58.360,00:42:01.280,We are a great team and we will develop the right car.
00:42:02.480,00:42:07.160,That's what makes me confident that we can certainly do better in the future.
00:42:14.800,00:42:16.960,"With the breakup, I am emotional."
00:42:23.640,00:42:26.120,I wanted to prove myself as a driver.
00:42:26.200,00:42:28.480,I deserve to go back to Red Bull.
00:42:28.560,00:42:29.600,Fuck yes!
00:00:49.200,00:00:53.120,Ask a child to draw a car and they'll color it red.
00:00:55.120,00:00:57.640,I think that's all you need to know about Ferrari.
00:00:59.880,00:01:04.360,It's everyone's understanding of what a racing car is.
00:01:07.200,00:01:09.600,Formula 1 is synonymous with Ferrari.
00:01:13.240,00:01:15.960,Arguably one of the biggest brands in the world.
00:01:16.040,00:01:18.200,They're the most iconic team in Formula 1.
00:01:20.720,00:01:22.880,A lot of drivers' dream is to drive for Ferrari.
00:01:30.040,00:01:32.200,that no other team holds.
00:01:33.880,00:01:36.040,They use that to its strength.
00:01:50.680,00:01:53.560,They aren't as competitive as they normally are.
00:01:56.320,00:01:58.400,Sebastian Vettel 14th.
00:02:12.480,00:02:15.280,is one of huge question marks.
00:02:25.280,00:02:26.600,when you're in the shit.
00:02:27.720,00:02:30.320,But I didn't have a whole lot of sympathy.
00:02:44.880,00:03:09.120,"We don't have that much time and, uh, yeah, to be honest… We're here in Monza for round eight of the Formula 1 World Championship in 2020."
00:03:09.200,00:03:11.000,It is the Italian Grand Prix.
00:04:41.480,00:04:45.080,How do you keep the expectations realistic for this weekend?
00:05:04.480,00:05:08.320,going into their homeland with nothing to show.
00:05:09.520,00:05:11.720,They have to try and find some redemption.
00:05:11.800,00:05:14.880,They have to find something to pin this season on.
00:05:36.040,00:05:44.720,"This is not to be filmed, but you got Ferrari upside down, which is okay, but maybe at best to put it… -There you are. -That's better?"
00:05:48.560,00:05:49.480,They are tricky.
00:05:55.520,00:05:58.960,"Uh, now, first point, please wear your mask all the time."
00:05:59.040,00:06:01.040,"As usual, this is really important."
00:06:05.720,00:06:08.320,"My name is Sebastian Vettel, racing for Scuderia Ferrari."
00:06:12.000,00:06:13.040,Brave.
00:06:13.120,00:06:14.160,No mask.
00:06:17.240,00:06:28.200,"I'm telling you this because the media have come up to us saying, Don't do it, you know, it doesn't look good, so just be focused on what you're doing and please don't look at your mobile."
00:06:31.560,00:06:33.960,"I'm watching the phone, but don't have any questions."
00:06:40.760,00:06:48.320,"Um, I have a contract until 2024 with the team and I started in Formula 1 two years ago."
00:06:52.320,00:07:01.520,"in what Sebastian is saying, so, just… But he is repeating, uh, the same… It's always the same question, so I know the answer."
00:07:49.280,00:07:52.040,"Morning, Charles and Seb. How are you guys?"
00:07:53.600,00:07:55.000,"Right, let's get cracking."
00:07:55.080,00:08:09.440,"We've got some brilliant fans here who, uh, are dying to… Uh, cut Zoom."
00:08:24.000,00:08:25.840,"Not just on track, also off track."
00:08:28.480,00:08:30.600,"Okay, Esther, go again. What was your question?"
00:08:35.560,00:08:38.760,"Oh! Uh, well, at the end, for now, it's on standby."
00:08:38.840,00:08:44.320,"Uh, it's something I really wanted to do and it's something that I think I will keep in mind for the future."
00:08:46.840,00:08:49.240,"-Like, a full collection. -Ah. He's not allowed."
00:08:51.120,00:08:54.440,'Cause we have a… We have a partner.
00:08:55.040,00:08:56.920,"So, he was told off."
00:08:57.000,00:09:21.400,"I… I… I'm not supposed to say that, but I'm leaving at the end of the year, I was surprised when I got the call that the team does not want to continue."
00:09:45.640,00:09:52.240,"that Sebastian Vettel's leaving the team, I think, is a clear state of intention of what they want for the future."
00:09:53.080,00:09:54.040,Charles Leclerc.
00:09:54.760,00:09:58.840,That's a pretty toxic environment for a man who's a four-times world champion.
00:10:01.760,00:10:05.840,"For sure, it's tough. Obviously, I care a lot about the sport."
00:10:05.920,00:10:12.080,"It's a big part of my life and therefore, you know, I asked myself a lot of questions about what I want to do in the future."
00:10:14.000,00:10:26.160,I think that Sebastian was left very hurt by the way in which his departure from the team came about.
00:10:28.480,00:10:37.240,"The fact that the negotiations hadn't been anywhere near as lengthy, shall we say, as we'd been led to believe."
00:11:01.320,00:11:04.680,Ferrari is just special. It has always been special for me.
00:11:14.640,00:11:18.120,"and, uh, it has always been a dream to be a driver for, for them."
00:11:25.600,00:11:27.720,the likes of which had never been seen.
00:11:33.840,00:11:39.920,"and Charles did, which shows just how important Charles had become to their future."
00:12:30.440,00:12:36.240,"Monza's national autodrome, it's time for Qualifying with 20 of the best drivers in the world."
00:12:36.840,00:12:42.080,"Today, Red Bull hope to interrupt an endless stream of pole positions for the German team."
00:12:42.160,00:12:46.680,And Ferrari are simply hoping somehow to find their way into the top ten.
00:12:55.920,00:13:04.000,"Expectations are difficult to have this season because it's unpredictable, the results, but it is a very special race for us, so, uh, we have to do well."
00:13:04.080,00:13:06.080,"But yeah, it's not going to be easy."
00:13:12.760,00:13:18.920,But I think everybody's trying to do their most to make sure that we still get the best out of the car.
00:13:29.400,00:13:31.680,It determines your starting position on the grid.
00:13:34.720,00:13:39.440,"The fewer people that start ahead of you, the fewer people you've got to overtake to win on Sunday."
00:13:59.320,00:14:01.200,Was Charles meant to be ahead of him?
00:14:01.280,00:14:04.000,Have Ferrari got things a little bit mixed up?
00:14:18.560,00:14:21.960,"the man, of course, who was on pole position here last year."
00:14:51.720,00:14:55.200,He doesn't have enough prancing horses down the front straight.
00:16:31.280,00:16:37.440,"Sebastian Vettel, he's in the bottom five at the moment, crosses the line in a few moments, Sebastian Vettel."
00:16:37.520,00:16:39.800,"Uh, we see Vettel pitting."
00:16:39.880,00:16:42.400,He's pitted. He's not going to improve his time.
00:16:45.920,00:16:47.960,What has happened to them this year?
00:17:00.040,00:17:02.040,"It's Ferrari, P17."
00:17:24.280,00:17:26.960,Thirteenth and 17th on the grid.
00:17:27.560,00:17:31.160,Ferrari's worst fears in qualifying have been confirmed.
00:17:41.160,00:17:42.960,and then down to this position?
00:17:43.040,00:17:45.520,That must be heavy for you.
00:17:49.080,00:17:57.960,"and then you do P13, it doesn't feel good, and, uh, yeah, I mean, it hurts even more once it's at home, but it's a reality at the moment for us, unfortunately."
00:18:17.160,00:18:29.680,"You can call it frustration, but at the end of the day, on power, we are probably worse off than we were last year and the unsatisfying, most unsatisfying bit is that you didn't get to prove to yourself, Okay, what could I do today?"
00:18:29.760,00:18:34.000,"You know, how close to the top or how far up could I have gone?"
00:19:36.280,00:19:43.560,"It's a tough time for Ferrari. There's been a lot of mudslinging, a lot of accusations regarding the secret settlement."
00:19:43.640,00:19:45.600,I was wondering how you cope with that?
00:20:08.880,00:20:10.960,and you can hear the cheers from Monza.
00:20:11.040,00:20:12.880,The Ferrari fans loved it.
00:20:14.680,00:20:17.880,Ferrari came out of the break last year firing on all cylinders.
00:20:25.040,00:20:28.200,They basically built a car with a rocket ship in the back of it.
00:20:39.720,00:20:42.880,The Ferrari's speed is giving Hamilton a lot to think about.
00:20:51.800,00:20:58.280,"Well, we highlighted certain things to the FIA, together with Mercedes, that… that we felt that they should be looking at."
00:21:03.040,00:21:04.880,but they knew something was up.
00:21:05.960,00:21:16.600,"All of a sudden, in Austin, we got rumblings of a technical directive all about fuel flow coming from the FIA, which is basically a rule clarification, that says you can, you cannot do this."
00:21:18.760,00:21:22.760,"you've got to say Charles Leclerc, just trying to get a handle on this car."
00:21:28.560,00:21:30.800,And then no power.
00:21:45.600,00:21:48.280,"Shit. Uh, that's how I call that."
00:21:48.360,00:21:51.920,I really don't know what happened. I think there was really something weird.
00:21:58.080,00:22:01.240,"because allegedly, they have been gaining an advantage with their engine."
00:22:01.320,00:22:03.080,The other teams are not happy about it.
00:22:03.160,00:22:09.520,"They did conduct an investigation, came to a conclusion, reached a settlement with Ferrari, but aren't disclosing the details of that."
00:22:12.720,00:22:14.960,We're pushing for full disclosure of that.
00:22:18.360,00:22:19.920,of any specific wrongdoing.
00:22:20.000,00:22:23.280,Are you disappointed then that they didn't clear the team?
00:22:27.200,00:22:30.520,and we trust the FIA to do their job.
00:22:32.000,00:22:39.880,"uh, and I trust the FIA for making sure everything was okay, so for me, yes, it's, uh, it's done, and now I look to the future."
00:22:58.840,00:23:03.040,it looks like Ferrari had an unfair advantage that the FIA took away.
00:23:08.200,00:23:10.680,I think that is not what I call reality.
00:23:11.880,00:23:27.520,"Going forward, we are staying with Ferrari, even if, in the moment it isn't… I mean, uh, uh… easy They helped us a lot in the beginning, so now, we need to help them and be loyal and... and a little bit patient."
00:23:32.400,00:23:37.800,"from last year to this year, I think it's self-explanatory."
00:24:08.120,00:24:12.360,as we prepare for round eight of the Formula 1 World Championship.
00:24:20.480,00:24:26.400,as the last time two Ferraris started outside the top ten at their home Grand Prix.
00:24:35.840,00:24:42.960,"2020, for Sebastian and Ferrari, it just hasn't quite clicked, it hasn't quite meshed."
00:24:52.040,00:25:00.840,"They are just there now, so if you want to film them… that far off."
00:25:04.440,00:25:14.400,"Seb's a four-time world champion and one of the most ruthless, brilliantly effective racing drivers that I've ever seen."
00:25:15.680,00:25:16.640,How are you?
00:25:19.880,00:25:23.080,You don't lose that ability overnight.
00:25:25.240,00:25:29.120,"Seb, um, I think you're a very morally guided person."
00:25:29.200,00:25:31.720,I think you have a good heart and a good direction.
00:25:31.800,00:25:43.240,"Well, I think you have to have your principles, so I think, uh, yes, as much as I want to succeed and I want myself to have success rather than others, I play by certain rules."
00:25:43.320,00:25:52.600,"And, you know, one of those rules are I have to be fair, and if being successful means that I have to break these rules, then it wouldn't feel right."
00:25:52.680,00:26:25.920,"It's like cheating, in the end, and you are cheating yourself, so… See you later."
00:26:26.000,00:26:29.680,"Yeah, it's, I'm sure, a question that you'll be asking him."
00:26:34.840,00:26:36.240,He has nowhere to go.
00:26:38.800,00:26:42.600,"Up and down the paddock, everybody was trying to work out what was he gonna do."
00:26:42.680,00:26:45.560,Would he leave Formula 1? Would he find another team?
00:26:52.280,00:26:55.000,shaped the last ten years in Formula 1.
00:26:55.680,00:26:59.920,Simply the fact that Sebastian's available is worth the discussion.
00:27:06.600,00:27:11.480,"I knew him from before he was a Formula 1 driver and, uh, for a very long time."
00:27:13.640,00:27:15.920,He's still a young man and very talented.
00:27:16.000,00:27:19.520,"It'd be, uh, a shame not to see him on the grid next season."
00:27:26.200,00:27:32.080,came from more than 40 points behind to beat Fernando Alonso to the 2012 World Championship.
00:27:33.520,00:27:36.880,We don't write anything off. Literally anything can happen.
00:28:26.480,00:28:29.600,"Ah, it's not the first time I started at the back of the grid."
00:28:32.560,00:28:34.520,I believe that there's always a chance.
00:28:34.600,00:28:39.720,"Sunday, when you stand on the grid, even if you're not in a great position, you never know what happens."
00:28:40.240,00:28:44.600,"If you are racing in P10 and the nine cars in front of you retire, you win the race."
00:29:01.360,00:29:05.080,for me to put extra pressure because I'm driving for Ferrari.
00:29:23.160,00:29:25.200,to be 100% focused on the goal.
00:29:54.840,00:29:58.920,Great getaway for Lewis Hamilton. Up to second place goes Carlos Sainz.
00:29:59.000,00:30:00.280,Bottas down to third.
00:30:02.600,00:30:05.520,Charles Leclerc is losing a position to Kimi Räikkönen.
00:30:15.680,00:30:18.920,"Charles Leclerc on the inside of Kimi Räikkönen, looking for a gap."
00:30:19.000,00:30:20.480,That soon disappears.
00:30:31.920,00:30:35.960,Hamilton's lead is three seconds over the McLaren of Carlos Sainz in second place.
00:30:36.560,00:30:37.520,Here's Vettel.
00:31:32.600,00:31:34.920,They've got Russell trying to get past him.
00:31:35.000,00:31:36.360,Vettel can't slow it down!
00:32:04.480,00:32:06.760,who's leaving Ferrari at the end of the season.
00:32:06.840,00:32:12.560,His last race as a Ferrari driver at Monza and he's out on lap eight of 53.
00:32:15.440,00:32:18.080,A torturous Italian Grand Prix for the Scuderia.
00:32:18.160,00:32:22.040,They'll hope this is as bad as it's going to be for them at their home ground.
00:32:51.960,00:32:55.600,It's just unbelievable and you don't get that anywhere else on the grid.
00:33:13.360,00:33:17.200,behind Antonio Giovinazzi He's got past Räikkönen.
00:33:17.280,00:33:19.760,He might clear two Alfas in about 300 meters here.
00:33:19.840,00:33:20.880,And he does!
00:33:20.960,00:33:24.560,Charles Leclerc picks off Räikkönen and picks off Giovinazzi as well.
00:33:28.920,00:33:31.760,"He hasn't lost any bravery and commitment, has he?"
00:33:34.600,00:33:40.200,"because if you are not confident in your car or your abilities, then you are going to struggle."
00:34:08.280,00:34:11.640,"But still, my goal is the same, to try to put the car on its limit."
00:34:46.880,00:34:47.880,It was very extreme.
00:34:47.960,00:34:50.560,I can remember everything apart from the hit itself.
00:34:51.560,00:34:54.320,I think there's a bit of a blackout for a few seconds.
00:34:54.400,00:34:55.840,The hit was pretty hard.
00:34:57.960,00:35:04.360,"Everything happened, uh, very, very quickly and then, unfortunately, puts all our hopes to the bin."
00:35:19.640,00:35:21.840,"And go to P0, please, P0."
00:35:30.560,00:35:31.800,Let's see what did happen.
00:35:31.880,00:35:34.480,He's on his own coming into the Parabolica.
00:35:34.560,00:35:39.560,"And he just lost it on the power on the hard tires, and driver error."
00:35:55.760,00:36:01.320,It was one of the most horrible weekends they've had in a very long time.
00:36:07.680,00:36:14.560,"because this is a team that should be fighting Mercedes and yet, they cannot compete with anybody."
00:36:30.360,00:36:32.720,"where we are, especially here, for our home race."
00:36:32.800,00:36:35.240,It's probably a blessing there's nobody in the stand.
00:36:44.920,00:36:47.680,We are in this position because we probably deserve to be.
00:37:28.720,00:37:31.000,and a milestone in motor racing.
00:37:36.000,00:37:39.480,And they're preparing to celebrate in style.
00:38:06.000,00:38:07.800,"The party, the displays."
00:38:08.440,00:38:13.040,"They are a huge, huge corporation, making millions of pounds."
00:38:15.040,00:38:16.680,This is the time to shine.
00:38:25.120,00:38:29.840,news that Sebastian Vettel has signed for Aston Martin.
00:38:30.480,00:38:33.960,"Seb, we understand you didn't even put pen to paper until last night."
00:38:39.840,00:38:43.600,"Today, it's been announced that I'll have a seat, I'll be on the grid next year."
00:38:43.680,00:38:45.400,I'm looking forward to a new challenge.
00:38:50.240,00:38:59.400,"that I can be competitive with Aston Martin, I think, uh, you know, life is treating me far too good uh, to drag on and to keep suffering."
00:39:58.640,00:40:00.800,The timing probably tells you everything.
00:40:33.720,00:40:37.240,but it puts the focus back on Sebastian.
00:40:54.880,00:41:01.840,"that with Racing Point, which will become Aston Martin next year, he can build this team up to be incredible."
00:41:05.000,00:41:11.720,"My number one ambition is to be at the front of the grid, fight for something worth fighting for and have fun and enjoy."
00:41:35.520,00:41:37.440,so we need to stay focused on what we do.
00:41:37.520,00:41:44.400,"I believe that if we continue to work step by step in the right direction, we'll manage to be in a much better position for next year."
00:42:17.040,00:42:20.480,"It's like being dumped by a girlfriend, but she hasn't moved out the house yet."
00:42:20.560,00:42:23.560,Pierre's confidence has completely transformed.
00:42:31.400,00:42:33.920,"In a season like this, small mistakes have big consequences."
00:42:34.000,00:42:36.320,"If you're not good enough, you will be spat out."
00:00:09.680,00:00:14.600,"Every single one of us at Renault, our focus is on the stability of the team."
00:00:15.120,00:00:17.960,Pure focus on this season's performance.
00:00:29.120,00:00:30.320,What a mess.
00:00:36.360,00:00:41.680,We need to be in a position to fight for podiums and then fight for wins and then fight for championships.
00:00:42.320,00:00:44.560,But Daniel has put a stop to all of that.
00:00:52.400,00:00:58.040,"I've done my best in not being hurt, in not making it personal, Daniel leaving me."
00:01:13.760,00:01:21.080,"What's been, I guess, hurting the most, is the fact that it's not the long-term project that I thought we had signed up for."
00:01:25.560,00:01:27.160,Ask him.
00:01:27.680,00:01:28.880,Ask him. Ask him.
00:05:35.400,00:05:36.800,Oh. Can I come here or not?
00:06:47.760,00:06:52.840,"With the breakup, uh, there was a period of time where we've not spoken."
00:06:53.560,00:06:55.360,Don't forget your mask.
00:06:56.440,00:07:00.240,I am emotional. I am Latin. I am a bit Mediterranean and French.
00:07:00.320,00:07:02.920,So I am emotional. I'm not going to change what I am.
00:07:03.000,00:07:05.440,"Frankly, I think he's making a mistake."
00:07:10.960,00:07:20.880,"The drivers with the biggest results, biggest success have also been the ones that have been able to take their time and to bring stability in their own life, in their own career."
00:07:21.960,00:07:28.680,But right now I have to accept that our priority is to believe in the dynamic with Daniel.
00:08:03.720,00:08:08.960,"With Daniel leaving, deciding to do something different, it's a very difficult situation."
00:08:09.480,00:08:14.680,"But on the top of that, there is one more layer of complexity to deal with right now."
00:09:57.520,00:10:03.840,"Racing Point, I want to understand, what happened there, frankly."
00:10:04.960,00:10:11.600,"We have a car that is very much uh, like the Mercedes car of last year, painted in pink, obviously."
00:10:12.720,00:10:15.240,"That's hurting, because I don't understand."
00:10:36.280,00:10:41.080,"No team should enhance the competitiveness of another team, other than as per the regulation."
00:10:42.640,00:10:44.520,-Yes. -Good.
00:10:45.720,00:10:49.480,A number of teams want to understand exactly what's behind the car.
00:12:14.040,00:12:15.280,100% athlete.
00:12:33.000,00:12:39.880,"It's immensely difficult, but it's really important to leave the emotion on one side."
00:12:40.640,00:12:44.920,"With Daniel and myself, I don't want to build bridges artificially."
00:12:45.000,00:12:50.920,"Right now, our focus, our single focus, needs to be on beating Racing Point."
00:13:51.520,00:13:53.240,"Stroll, 0.6 behind."
00:13:54.800,00:13:56.120,Okay. Understood.
00:15:01.200,00:15:03.200,Shit. Shit!
00:15:05.440,00:15:09.080,I hate those fucking pink cars.
00:16:01.720,00:16:03.800,Which is what we discussed this morning.
00:16:07.680,00:16:09.200,Fuck!
00:16:22.640,00:16:26.440,We have decided to protest against Racing Point.
00:17:32.120,00:17:39.760,"Today, I have the hearing for Racing Point, set up by the FIA with the stewards that will be judging the case."
00:17:41.560,00:17:45.760,My responsibility is to... to make sure that I look after Renault.
00:17:46.320,00:17:48.680,We are not fighting on a level playing field.
00:17:53.480,00:17:59.680,"I want to understand what Formula 1 stands for today, and what will it stand for tomorrow?"
00:17:59.760,00:18:01.720,That's what's at stake.
00:18:07.680,00:18:11.320,It's very much the governing bodies that are leading the show.
00:18:11.880,00:18:16.360,The FIA needs to set the tone of what we will be up and doing.
00:18:17.200,00:18:20.120,Please wait. The meeting host will let you in soon.
00:18:21.960,00:18:24.560,It's not like the race start. It doesn't start on time.
00:19:06.480,00:19:08.960,Racing Point's arguments are bullshit.
00:19:10.080,00:19:14.280,Those parts are what make the difference in performance.
00:19:14.360,00:19:18.760,It's the parts that increase the performance and everyone looks after themselves.
00:19:18.840,00:19:21.400,That's fundamentally what makes Formula 1.
00:19:22.360,00:19:23.880,"It's not very cool, all this."
00:19:25.520,00:19:27.760,It's not the essence of F1. It's not.
00:19:30.920,00:19:32.880,"-Yes. -Yeah, for sure."
00:20:22.640,00:20:24.800,We have the hearing for the protest.
00:20:29.360,00:20:35.880,"I guess, if it's illegal, it should be disqualified from all the races that we've protested so far."
00:20:49.920,00:20:53.040,-Will they have to change the part? -They would have to.
00:21:23.920,00:21:25.920,"Okay, we win, but not completely."
00:21:26.000,00:21:27.720,-Oh. -Protest is upheld.
00:21:33.320,00:21:36.400,-7.5 points. From what? -7.5 points?
00:21:40.240,00:21:41.960,Out of how many scored?
00:21:49.280,00:21:52.400,Can I drive Otmar's car? I think he's got a fantastic collection.
00:21:52.480,00:21:55.040,"If I can drive his collection of cars, I'm fine."
00:21:55.680,00:21:58.680,"No, that's, that's fucking bullshit."
00:22:01.440,00:22:05.720,"Let's be factual. This decision, frankly, it's unfair."
00:24:26.440,00:24:27.960,That's ridiculous.
00:24:28.040,00:24:32.000,"Yeah, the fine's a joke, isn't it, to someone like their team owner."
00:27:04.000,00:27:08.120,It's up to us now to demonstrate what we have to achieve as a team.
00:27:09.280,00:27:10.760,And what you want is to win.
00:27:11.280,00:27:12.760,And we want to beat them.
00:27:13.600,00:27:16.920,"-That front wing looks like ours, Cyril. -Yeah."
00:27:18.040,00:27:19.280,We took some pictures.
00:27:21.400,00:27:22.240,Fuck!
00:28:56.560,00:28:57.560,Frickin'!
00:28:57.640,00:28:59.200,He's pulling away from me..
00:29:23.120,00:29:27.520,"All of us at Renault, we have a vision for where we want to take the team."
00:29:28.480,00:29:32.200,"With Daniel leaving, Esteban is absolutely crucial."
00:29:47.920,00:29:49.320,"Ah, c'mon!"
00:30:10.360,00:30:12.800,Push all you've got. Push all you've got.
00:30:13.320,00:30:14.600,I am pushing.
00:30:33.480,00:30:34.320,C'mon!
00:30:46.160,00:30:47.040,C'mon!
00:30:58.440,00:31:00.080,Now we've got a race.
00:31:49.280,00:31:57.160,"One thing I must say is that, watching Daniel, right now, it's something that's making me feel the frustration and disappointment."
00:32:04.040,00:32:11.200,"But he decided to make the decision when he decided to make it, with just one year together, in such a short horizon of time."
00:33:52.400,00:33:53.880,He gave everything.
00:33:56.240,00:33:57.360,"Great race, Daniel."
00:34:02.680,00:34:04.520,Super race. Thanks a lot.
00:34:13.440,00:34:15.040,"Great drive, Esteban."
00:34:17.440,00:34:19.240,Super team result. Super.
00:34:20.040,00:34:22.800,"The last three laps, just mayhem, mate."
00:34:22.880,00:34:24.680,"Mate, good race. P4, boy."
00:34:25.200,00:34:27.880,-Yeah. -You and Esteban were doing well.
00:34:35.120,00:34:50.280,"Exactly. I mean, when the car is reliable… I have to admit that, with Daniel, I want to move on, so that we are extremely focused, 150% focused, on what's going to be a super-intense season together."
00:35:00.600,00:35:04.840,We all want to see Daniel on the podium with Renault as quickly as possible.
00:35:05.480,00:35:07.880,"Right now, we have a job to do together."
00:35:21.440,00:35:23.320,-So close! -So close!
00:35:23.400,00:35:24.640,-So close. -That's good.
00:35:24.720,00:35:26.840,-Thank you for that. Thank you. -No worries.
00:35:26.920,00:35:29.400,And thank you for a couple of very nice maneuvers.
00:35:29.480,00:35:31.960,"It was nice. It was fun, huh? It was a fun race."
00:35:32.520,00:35:35.160,-Crazy. -Thanks for that. Cheers.
00:35:37.960,00:35:44.680,"Here, today, after what we have achieved together, maybe all of us are a bit closer."
00:35:45.760,00:35:49.040,I am in the process of rebuilding my relationship with him.
00:35:49.760,00:35:50.880,Even though I have...
00:00:24.600,00:00:26.240,Is he stuck in third gear?
00:00:46.920,00:00:49.680,is that Daniel Ricciardo is on his way to McLaren.
00:00:49.760,00:00:51.040,What do you make of that?
00:01:03.360,00:01:13.680,"so from Renault's point of view, they're sort of thinking, Come on, we've given you everything you've asked for and more, and you've not actually given us a chance to prove we're on a better trajectory than McLaren."
00:01:48.680,00:01:50.320,"This is a setup, by the way."
00:02:15.240,00:02:17.120,Why does your hair always look so good?
00:02:18.000,00:02:19.600,-Do you dye it? -Just don't wash it.
00:02:21.080,00:02:23.320,"No shit, actually. I'm not just saying that."
00:02:25.440,00:02:27.000,You look good when you do it too.
00:02:27.080,00:02:28.360,-Yeah? -Mm.
00:02:32.080,00:02:34.640,"Three, two, one, go."
00:02:39.360,00:02:41.640,it was my decision to leave Renault.
00:02:42.200,00:02:50.280,"But, uh, yeah, there was a few sleepless nights, I think, trying to figure out what was best."
00:02:56.120,00:02:59.400,I feel you can be honest with yourself when you're on your own.
00:03:00.000,00:03:02.840,"I'll get a chance to, like, reflect on last year."
00:03:03.640,00:03:10.440,"The goals when I joined Renault was, by year two, the podium was really what we believed we could be at."
00:03:11.400,00:03:16.880,But… …it can't get worse than last year.
00:03:21.920,00:03:26.360,"Okay, let's give a big round of applause to Daniel, please. Thank you."
00:03:30.520,00:03:35.120,"take the fight to the big teams, and when he joined it, it was actually a team that went backwards."
00:03:42.920,00:03:45.640,Can I win with all cars finishing?
00:03:45.720,00:03:50.080,"Uh… It still hurts to say this. Like, the reality is no."
00:04:05.720,00:04:06.760,So I chose to leave.
00:04:10.600,00:04:12.600,They've lost their star driver effectively.
00:04:18.360,00:04:21.400,I think they made the biggest step out of any team in 2019.
00:04:40.560,00:04:42.480,"-How are you, dude? -All good."
00:04:42.560,00:04:49.640,"And I just felt McLaren was in a better place than... than Renault was, and that was really what... what drove me to that decision."
00:04:59.640,00:05:00.680,Hello.
00:05:03.320,00:05:04.640,Hello.
00:05:07.960,00:05:12.200,but this is the first ever Styrian Grand Prix.
00:05:28.120,00:05:30.600,-Okay. -Which will be in your driver room.
00:05:40.480,00:05:42.400,Or whatever it is. We could do that.
00:05:47.080,00:05:50.240,It doesn't feel like it's been that long actually.
00:05:53.400,00:05:55.880,"So tell me, is, uh, is Cyril talking to you yet?"
00:06:00.640,00:06:01.520,Oh well.
00:06:03.280,00:06:07.760,"It's probably a bit like being dumped by a girlfriend, but she hasn't moved out of the house yet."
00:06:11.680,00:06:13.240,"All right, boys. Have fun!"
00:06:19.680,00:06:22.200,that he's going to their biggest competitor.
00:06:32.680,00:06:38.160,"You naturally shut down to that individual, because, you know, they've... they've left you."
00:06:39.000,00:06:41.480,"Cyril, no doubt, took that very personally."
00:07:45.840,00:07:46.800,Oh well.
00:07:50.160,00:07:51.000,Itchy.
00:08:18.960,00:08:20.840,with an awful lot of pace.
00:08:23.440,00:08:42.000,"It's only the second race of the season, but we've got our first controversy, and it's one that's been brewing ever since Racing Point unveiled a car that the paddock quickly nicknamed the Pink Mercedes, because the other teams think it's so similar-looking to last year's all-conquering Mercedes Formula 1 car."
00:08:45.600,00:08:52.200,"Racing Point insist they've done absolutely nothing wrong, the car is completely legal and within the regulations."
00:08:52.280,00:09:00.560,"But this sleeping giant, which now has big funding from Lawrence Stroll, I think has got a lot of teams scared."
00:09:05.960,00:09:07.880,He's absolutely flying.
00:09:08.920,00:09:13.000,"You love racing, it obviously doesn't get any better than Formula 1."
00:09:21.080,00:09:27.520,"This year, we're already witnessing the team, with the right resources, getting an opportunity to show what they can do."
00:09:30.960,00:09:32.960,Racing Point certainly have pace.
00:09:36.640,00:09:38.320,And that's winning.
00:09:43.040,00:09:48.960,"This season, it seems like we've got a good chance of being better than McLaren, than Renault."
00:09:49.560,00:09:54.960,"We'll have a very good chance at, uh, finishing either at the top of the midfield or a little bit higher."
00:10:22.160,00:10:23.240,It's hard to believe.
00:10:23.320,00:10:25.760,"And I have, uh, you know, a great car under me."
00:10:26.840,00:10:29.320,So I'm really just riding a good wave.
00:10:29.400,00:10:33.040,"And, uh, there will always be controversy in this sport."
00:10:33.120,00:10:34.920,There's no peace in Formula 1.
00:10:50.120,00:10:56.000,"I think it's the tip of the iceberg, that, uh, it needs to be looked at much more closely."
00:10:59.200,00:11:01.240,and that situation can't occur.
00:11:05.240,00:11:12.600,"that, um, you know, we don't think what they've done with their race car this year, uh, is right."
00:11:15.520,00:11:18.600,"Quite frankly, I don't think he's ever engineered a car in his life."
00:11:18.680,00:11:21.200,I don't think he's ever drawn a part in his life.
00:11:21.280,00:11:25.120,"So for him to say that, that doesn't hold any water with me."
00:11:34.280,00:11:37.640,The cars are leaving the garage. You can hear the rev...
00:11:53.600,00:12:04.280,"you know, in Renault who maybe think where you're at, and kind of where your head is and where your commitment is, but my hunger for beating every driver on the grid is still the same."
00:12:04.800,00:12:06.080,Five zero.
00:12:16.520,00:12:17.680,"From my side, I..."
00:12:17.760,00:12:26.600,"I 100% want to try and… get it through to Cyril that, you know, look, um, McLaren is 2021."
00:12:28.480,00:12:31.920,"I still really, really, really want to do what I can with you guys."
00:12:57.880,00:12:59.800,This is gonna be a helter-skelter...
00:13:02.880,00:13:03.960,to get that podium.
00:13:04.480,00:13:16.760,"So let's focus on It's the first ever Styrian Grand Prix, and it's lights out and away we go!"
00:13:34.320,00:13:37.000,Is he gonna launch one right around the outside?
00:13:39.080,00:13:42.200,He is. Outrageous pace from Sergio Perez.
00:13:45.120,00:13:49.560,Lance Stroll is also going to be having a go at Ricciardo before too long.
00:14:29.560,00:14:32.200,Ooh! He barges his way through!
00:14:53.240,00:14:54.840,"If I turned in, we'd crash."
00:14:57.120,00:14:58.160,Pretty shit day.
00:15:12.800,00:15:16.520,"We're gonna talk first about Racing Point. Lance, talk us through your race."
00:15:19.440,00:15:21.240,"Um, there was a lot..."
00:15:26.040,00:15:27.480,A bit of a controversial one.
00:15:32.920,00:15:37.600,"if Daniel hadn't got out, he would've been pushed off and contact would have been made."
00:15:41.440,00:15:48.560,"But I also felt like the Racing Point is so fast they're gonna be a threat, I think, at every circuit we go to."
00:15:49.920,00:15:51.440,"Oh, fucking hell."
00:15:59.320,00:16:01.600,struggling to hold on to the Racing Points.
00:16:12.520,00:16:15.200,have got an issue with that Racing Point car.
00:16:15.280,00:16:21.120,"But all it takes is one team to protest, and the first one that did was Cyril and Renault."
00:16:40.240,00:16:42.280,that you cannot see with the naked eye.
00:16:43.560,00:16:46.280,They're focused on Racing Point's brake ducts.
00:16:53.240,00:16:55.800,we purchased some information from Mercedes.
00:16:57.840,00:17:06.200,"Information on listed parts is not allowed to be passed from team to team, which means you have to design and develop 'em yourself."
00:17:07.440,00:17:12.360,The brake ducts were a non-listed part last year and are a listed part this year.
00:17:12.880,00:17:16.480,I don't think the FIA can point to a rule that we contravened.
00:17:17.320,00:17:26.320,"Everything we did was legal, and for anybody to suggest otherwise, um, is incorrect."
00:17:48.760,00:17:50.200,"Marilyn, how are you?"
00:18:02.920,00:18:04.280,Not started yet. No.
00:19:43.360,00:19:49.720,"However, we're good at overcoming those types of regulations and extracting the most performance out of a car."
00:20:05.920,00:20:10.320,And he provided the very good people at Racing Point with more resource.
00:20:12.640,00:20:17.720,"I mean, the whole Racing Point saga, it's just a little bit of, uh, comedy."
00:20:37.400,00:20:49.320,"For me, it's very difficult, 'cause, you know, it's all about the politics outside and the talks and who decides what, and, you know, it goes out of your control and that's as simple as that."
00:21:01.320,00:21:05.840,But Renault feel that what Racing Point have done this year crosses the line.
00:21:06.800,00:21:14.840,"So today's judgment, today's ruling from the FIA, has massive ramifications for the future of the sport."
00:21:18.360,00:21:22.240,but we're expecting the results of the FIA protest any minute now.
00:21:22.320,00:21:23.840,"As we know, Renault are..."
00:21:28.240,00:21:33.240,"A 200,000 euro fine for each car and a 7.5 points deduction for each car."
00:21:44.240,00:21:49.200,And do they make tea all weekend for all the teams or is there any kind of forced labor?
00:22:10.400,00:22:15.080,and our competitors are kicking themselves for not having thought of doing the same.
00:22:19.480,00:22:23.040,"for their use of these brake ducts, but they're allowed to keep using them."
00:22:24.520,00:22:27.120,"Renault are not happy, and they're not the only ones."
00:22:27.200,00:22:32.560,"McLaren and Williams have joined the appeal, and, crucially, Ferrari."
00:22:39.880,00:22:43.360,when we see something in the sport that we think is outside the rules.
00:22:43.440,00:22:47.080,"I think this is the, uh, start of this situation, not the end."
00:22:47.680,00:22:48.520,Right.
00:22:56.760,00:23:08.400,"Some people felt under pressure with their performances and started on that mission, trying to find reasons why their performances were not at the level they should have been."
00:23:08.480,00:23:12.680,"We just acknowledged that they did a good job, and others didn't."
00:23:18.440,00:23:25.040,"Racing Point. Well, Otmar, fined, points deducted, 400,000 euros."
00:23:25.120,00:23:27.600,Does it feel like a real knockdown right now for you?
00:23:29.560,00:23:34.120,"It's a shame that the protest was upheld, but we did absolutely nothing wrong."
00:23:34.200,00:23:37.360,"Otmar, 24 hours to appeal. Will you do it?"
00:23:37.440,00:23:39.200,We read the sporting regulations.
00:23:39.280,00:23:43.000,There is nothing specific in there that says we couldn't do what we did.
00:23:43.080,00:23:44.520,But the car is legal.
00:23:45.120,00:23:50.640,The brake ducts are compliant with the regulations and we can continue to run 'em for the rest of the year.
00:23:51.240,00:23:53.400,"Um, so are you gonna appeal? You have 24 hours."
00:23:54.840,00:23:58.440,"They're saying that you've got no intentional wrongdoing, is the gist?"
00:24:01.320,00:24:05.360,"It's just the rules were ambiguous, and still are today."
00:24:09.000,00:24:10.960,The verdict itself is flawed.
00:24:11.480,00:24:14.000,We invited the FIA into the factory.
00:24:14.080,00:24:17.760,"We showed 'em all of our designs, and they were completely fine with that."
00:24:18.240,00:24:23.280,"So the verdict today was, um… uh, illogical to me."
00:24:23.360,00:24:25.680,We didn't… We didn't contravene one rule.
00:25:07.680,00:25:08.520,Good morning.
00:25:09.440,00:25:11.520,I do not often speak publicly.
00:25:12.280,00:25:17.200,"However, I'm extremely angry at any suggestion that we have cheated."
00:25:17.960,00:25:23.320,"This team, under various names, has competed in Formula 1 for over 30 years."
00:25:24.440,00:25:29.160,"Between 2016 and '18, this was the fourth-best team on the grid."
00:25:29.760,00:25:34.160,"We've always been a constructor, and will continue to be so in the future."
00:25:35.480,00:25:52.960,"Beyond the clear fact that Racing Point complied with the technical regulations, I am appalled by the way Renault, McLaren, Ferrari and Williams have taken this opportunity to appeal, and, in doing so, attempted to distract from our performances."
00:25:53.560,00:25:57.840,These accusations are completely unacceptable and not true.
00:25:58.560,00:26:03.280,"They are dragging our name through the mud, and I will not stand by, nor accept this."
00:26:03.360,00:26:06.480,"In closing, we did absolutely nothing wrong."
00:26:07.000,00:26:08.640,We stayed within the rules.
00:26:09.400,00:26:12.680,And we will demonstrate and prove that through the appeal process.
00:26:13.200,00:26:14.560,Thank you for your time.
00:26:28.160,00:26:31.680,"Our competitors, I think they have to look at their own competence."
00:26:31.760,00:26:34.520,They have their own factories. They have their own guys.
00:26:34.600,00:26:36.600,They simply didn't do a good enough job.
00:26:37.160,00:26:39.960,"Okay, now let's race and let's fix this problem."
00:26:49.760,00:26:54.360,"I see them as a competitor right now, and if they're faster, we've gotta find a way to do better."
00:27:01.040,00:27:03.920,Glorious sounds of engines beginning to rev...
00:27:32.400,00:27:37.920,a very basic goal I have for myself is to leave this track with no regrets.
00:27:39.240,00:27:42.440,No hesitations. Just conviction.
00:27:43.040,00:27:44.160,Decisiveness.
00:27:44.880,00:27:46.400,I want to beat that team.
00:27:47.800,00:27:51.120,You have to do it. It's just… You have to do it.
00:28:48.560,00:28:50.080,round the outside of Lance Stroll.
00:29:09.840,00:29:11.040,Vettel behind you.
00:29:18.280,00:29:20.720,"Locks up, can't get past Ocon."
00:29:42.360,00:29:46.640,"Wheel to wheel, Stroll's trying to hang on, and he manages it."
00:29:58.000,00:30:00.800,"This time, to the outside. Stroll squeezes him."
00:30:02.040,00:30:04.440,And he still keeps hold of ninth place.
00:30:24.280,00:30:30.240,"So is the pressure intensifying, I wonder, as Esteban Ocon is now only half a second behind Lance Stroll?"
00:30:42.640,00:30:45.640,And Esteban Ocon is past the Racing Point!
00:30:53.280,00:30:56.040,Esteban's got past and up into eighth place.
00:31:04.480,00:31:06.720,"Then, in third, comes Max Verstappen."
00:31:08.720,00:31:11.880,"Behind them though, they're still squabbling away for position."
00:31:18.040,00:31:19.920,Same pace as Norris and Sainz ahead.
00:32:28.680,00:32:31.840,"Oh, and what's happened? Bottas. There's a puff of smoke there."
00:32:31.920,00:32:33.880,We'll try and figure out what's happened.
00:32:53.280,00:32:54.320,How are the tires?
00:33:00.640,00:33:02.520,so let's keep the pressure up on him.
00:33:16.400,00:33:20.520,The same thing's happened to the McLaren. The tires are failing at Silverstone.
00:33:37.360,00:33:39.280,to take fourth position in this race.
00:33:39.360,00:33:40.800,What a performance that is.
00:33:43.360,00:33:44.760,Woo-hoo!
00:33:48.440,00:33:50.960,Nice. Nice. Nice.
00:34:31.960,00:34:34.360,"to be ready for that kind of opportunity, right?"
00:34:57.040,00:34:59.400,"but, uh, we have next week, another chance."
00:35:12.400,00:35:15.800,"Um, yeah, just feels quite rewarding, this one."
00:36:00.000,00:36:03.240,"Sitting here today, I don't know if it's the best call I've ever made or not."
00:36:04.240,00:36:06.680,"I've obviously, in a way, taken a bit of a punt."
00:36:07.200,00:36:08.720,It could swing either way.
00:36:14.120,00:36:15.120,I'll need a whiskey.
00:36:23.040,00:36:25.360,Now we're gonna score some fucking points.
00:36:31.560,00:36:32.680,The fight is on.
00:36:36.240,00:36:37.920,"This year, is very different."
00:00:07.800,00:00:08.720,I lost it.
00:00:08.800,00:00:10.560,Fucking hell! No!
00:00:16.120,00:00:19.200,Last year was probably the hardest moment of my life.
00:00:20.480,00:00:22.560,I had the Red Bull demotion.
00:00:24.080,00:00:26.600,I got moved from Red Bull to Toro Rosso.
00:00:33.320,00:00:37.200,It was a really horrible and… and difficult time for me to go through.
00:00:37.280,00:00:39.280,"Yeah, of course, I got a lot of shit."
00:00:51.960,00:00:57.680,"In 2020, I feel I'm a more complete driver and probably performing at my best level at the moment."
00:01:07.440,00:01:09.720,I deserve to go back to Red Bull.
00:01:11.560,00:01:13.520,"And that's the target, yeah, that's clear."
00:01:33.440,00:01:36.320,- Whatever. -My jeans are good. Don't touch my jeans.
00:01:37.560,00:01:38.760,"Okay, that's nice."
00:01:40.040,00:01:42.040,I think this is gonna go great. Look.
00:01:47.720,00:01:49.280,- Oh my God! -Here he is.
00:01:50.200,00:01:51.840,Who is this wild animal?
00:01:53.600,00:01:55.400,"It's actually good, the weather now."
00:01:55.480,00:01:58.000,"Yeah, when the sun's out, it's getting much hotter."
00:01:58.080,00:02:00.160,"Yeah, but you're hot all the time, right?"
00:02:00.240,00:02:02.240,"-No. -When I get close to you, you get hot."
00:02:02.320,00:02:04.640,"No, not really. Somehow… somehow not."
00:02:05.520,00:02:06.840,Not anymore.
00:02:09.600,00:02:10.640,"Of course, yeah."
00:02:37.080,00:02:38.120,Fuck yes!
00:03:05.080,00:03:07.040,"For me, it was good to be back."
00:03:07.840,00:03:10.520,"Suddenly, I understood how to drive again."
00:03:13.960,00:03:19.120,"Of course, the car is not as competitive and, as a competitive guy, you always wanna be in the fastest car."
00:03:19.200,00:03:24.080,My goal will always be to be in that Red Bull car in the top team.
00:03:25.320,00:03:33.360,"As long as I'm competitive, as long as I'm pushing, opportunities will come and… and that's just my… my spirit and mentality at the moment."
00:04:14.320,00:04:16.480,It's very tough going back to Spa.
00:04:16.560,00:04:18.360,All these memories come back.
00:04:18.440,00:04:20.120,But I'm not someone gives up.
00:04:24.360,00:04:25.560,What's the plan?
00:04:26.080,00:04:30.240,To do the interviews and the first one is Jennie Gow from BBC.
00:04:30.320,00:04:32.280,- Yeah. - We'll do it by phone.
00:04:34.000,00:04:39.800,"Now, Pierre, we all remember the events of Spa last year."
00:04:39.880,00:04:43.040,"Obviously, getting demoted from Red Bull."
00:04:43.640,00:04:48.160,Why is it that you are so much more comfortable in the AlphaTauri team?
00:04:48.240,00:04:58.320,"You seem happy, your results speak for themselves, versus that Red Bull second seat, which is always one that's uncomfortable, I think, for everybody that ever takes it?"
00:04:58.400,00:05:13.840,"I don't want to go into too much details about that, but they gave Alex the seat last year because he had some decent results, um, and… and hopefully, the… um, yeah, for the… the coming years, it's gonna be decided on the same, uh, on the same criteria."
00:05:14.360,00:05:16.760,"But at the end of the day, I'm not the one deciding."
00:05:28.360,00:05:33.440,"Unfortunately, I've just had to have one of the dogs put down, so… Oh no!"
00:05:33.520,00:05:36.960,It's horrible because they become such a part of the family.
00:05:37.880,00:05:40.640,"The mood I'm in, I tell you, ask me about Pierre."
00:05:42.160,00:05:48.680,"It's exactly one year ago when Red Bull swapped the seats between, uh, Pierre Gasly and Alex Albon."
00:06:17.360,00:06:18.200,Ça va?
00:07:17.320,00:07:18.840,How do you get in this place?
00:07:40.680,00:07:42.280,Right. Let's see what we've got.
00:08:11.840,00:08:13.440,"How's the balance, Alex?"
00:08:14.200,00:08:16.880,This car feels very nervous into turn one.
00:08:17.560,00:08:20.240,It just feels like I'm sliding from entry to exit.
00:08:20.840,00:08:23.000,-Like the tires are gone. - Okay.
00:08:39.200,00:08:40.240,You all right?
00:08:41.240,00:08:42.720,Does the car seem a bit more settled?
00:08:42.800,00:08:45.720,"It's still nervous, but at least it's predictable."
00:08:46.640,00:08:47.520,Yeah.
00:08:47.600,00:09:12.720,"He doesn't sound very happy at all, so… Based on the car this weekend?"
00:09:22.320,00:09:23.360,That's all it is.
00:09:28.800,00:09:30.960,Some of that will be experience as well.
00:09:31.480,00:09:33.360,"He's not far off the podium, though."
00:09:48.560,00:09:49.480,Quiet.
00:09:50.160,00:09:51.400,"Ah, it is, yeah."
00:09:52.320,00:09:55.840,Coming back to Spa reminded me of all the memories from the year before.
00:09:59.440,00:10:04.800,The fatal accident of Antoine Hubert happened at the famous Eau Rouge corner just behind us.
00:10:04.880,00:10:16.400,"at the most dangerous event of the season in Formula 1 and Formula 2… Last year, I got moved from Red Bull to Toro Rosso and then Anthoine passed away that same weekend."
00:10:16.920,00:10:19.640,It was the hardest moment of my life.
00:10:24.480,00:10:26.080,He was such a… a close friend.
00:10:27.720,00:10:29.920,Since we were little kids.
00:10:32.680,00:10:34.600,We had the same life goal.
00:10:35.240,00:10:38.520,He wanted as much as… as I wanted to be in Formula 1.
00:11:01.480,00:11:02.840,"Fucking crazy, eh?"
00:11:12.360,00:11:16.720,Prove everybody wrong and… show them your… your skills and talent.
00:11:37.880,00:11:39.960,We nearly got your fucking number two!
00:12:05.960,00:12:07.000,You all right?
00:12:07.080,00:12:09.960,"If we could put them under pressure, they would crack."
00:12:10.040,00:12:11.440,Just go aggressive.
00:12:37.040,00:12:40.480,- How much more time? - Race is two minutes to green.
00:13:00.120,00:13:02.280,"Okay, Pierre, you know the target."
00:13:06.840,00:13:08.720,"Ah, fuck's sake!"
00:13:09.320,00:13:10.480,Lost the rear a bit.
00:13:36.040,00:13:37.520,Let's have another go at him.
00:13:42.800,00:13:43.800,Get stuck in.
00:13:49.480,00:13:51.680,We can barely catch them with DRS.
00:13:57.720,00:14:00.640,You know what our race is. We go all in.
00:14:06.080,00:14:17.480,After what happened to Anthoine… I need to show everybody… …that I'm performing better.
00:14:18.960,00:14:21.480,Be careful there. You have to be careful.
00:14:38.720,00:14:40.200,That's how we race!
00:14:40.280,00:14:42.760,What a job. That's P11.
00:14:51.520,00:14:53.480,We are back in business. P10.
00:15:02.600,00:15:03.880,"That's, uh, P9."
00:15:04.520,00:15:07.320,"Okay, head down, Pierre, head down. Stroll in front."
00:15:08.360,00:15:09.600,"Come on, let's get him."
00:15:25.080,00:15:27.760,"Alex, it's the last lap now. Stay strong."
00:15:30.040,00:15:32.320,"Uh, gap behind to Ocon is reducing."
00:16:16.600,00:16:18.280,"What a drive, Pierre."
00:16:18.360,00:16:19.280,Wow!
00:16:20.040,00:16:21.200,Fuck yeah!
00:16:23.240,00:16:25.400,"Okay, Alex, hard luck there in the end."
00:16:26.360,00:16:27.720,Yep.
00:16:39.360,00:16:40.520,It was unreal.
00:17:27.240,00:17:29.120,You mastered six moves in the end.
00:17:29.200,00:17:32.040,Oh yeah? My favorite one was the one on Pérez.
00:17:32.120,00:18:12.160,"I was like, If he keeps going, we're both in the wall, and I'm just fucking going for it, so… It's great to see our sister team, AlphaTauri, uh, doing a fantastic job."
00:18:12.240,00:18:13.680,Good for Pierre as well.
00:18:13.760,00:18:16.800,"Uh, he looks very comfortable in that environment."
00:18:16.880,00:18:22.200,"He looks… looks, uh, relaxed and he's driving at the potential that we knew he had."
00:18:29.760,00:18:32.880,"Obviously, Pierre got Driver of the Day today."
00:18:32.960,00:18:35.720,Does it put him back in the frame for a future with Red Bull?
00:19:42.160,00:19:44.920,"I told him, now he has to deal with you at home every day."
00:19:54.920,00:19:58.440,"Why is it, as soon as the cameras are on, you mess up?"
00:20:00.920,00:20:03.400,I just hope we can overtake this time.
00:20:03.920,00:20:06.120,- I think it's gonna be hard. - Yeah.
00:20:06.200,00:20:07.720,Ready for a good day.
00:20:13.800,00:20:18.680,"Remember what I was saying earlier, if they start hammering you, don't stand for any bollocks."
00:20:19.280,00:20:20.680,We're in control.
00:21:12.600,00:21:13.600,Rumble time.
00:21:18.320,00:21:21.560,Welcome to Gas-man's Carpool Karaoke.
00:21:25.240,00:21:26.640,"So, do you want the news?"
00:21:27.440,00:21:32.360,"No 2020 Red Bull return for Gasly, Horner said."
00:21:32.880,00:21:34.760,Alex is only going to get better.
00:21:34.840,00:21:39.520,He's still pretty young and inexperienced and we are doing all we can to support and develop him.
00:21:43.960,00:21:50.000,"But seriously, it's like… It's a joke. How they treat this is a joke."
00:21:53.640,00:21:54.840,I have my target.
00:21:55.400,00:21:56.480,The fight is on.
00:21:57.480,00:22:00.160,"And now, we're gonna score some fucking points."
00:22:11.720,00:22:14.320,"Sometimes, Formula 1 is not fair."
00:22:16.480,00:22:18.600,"Unfortunately, that's the way it is."
00:22:18.680,00:22:21.160,"I feel this is, like, extra small."
00:22:21.240,00:22:23.080,"No, it's just pumped guns."
00:22:26.880,00:22:32.080,"But if I get knocked, I just go back at it even harder."
00:22:33.040,00:22:35.120,-Radio check okay? - Radio is good.
00:22:40.200,00:22:42.280,We go to the grid. Please confirm.
00:22:42.800,00:22:44.080,Copy.
00:22:46.040,00:22:51.760,"When things piss you off, me, I use this energy to make me even stronger."
00:24:43.560,00:24:46.640,Can you check my front? I was sandwiched.
00:24:57.120,00:24:59.200,I've got no grip on these hards!
00:25:00.200,00:25:03.080,We've got a little bit of floor damage on the left-hand side.
00:25:04.560,00:25:08.160,"- So, we're gonna be at the back? - We are currently P14."
00:25:21.280,00:25:23.720,"Okay, Pierre, box, box. Box, box."
00:25:25.760,00:25:27.880,Torque one in the pitlane. Focus on reaction time.
00:25:39.800,00:25:40.800,We are good?
00:26:09.200,00:26:10.520,Leclerc is out?
00:26:10.600,00:26:12.640,Confirmed. He went out.
00:26:13.640,00:26:16.040,Safety car. Safety car. Safety car!
00:26:19.400,00:26:21.720,"Okay, Pierre. They are still clearing the track."
00:26:21.800,00:26:24.840,Pit-lane entry is closed at the moment. I'll keep you posted.
00:26:33.920,00:26:35.800,Who pitted in front of us?
00:26:37.240,00:26:40.520,"Only Hamilton, but the pit lane was closed, so he should have a penalty."
00:26:51.600,00:26:54.760,There will be some cars in the pit exit. Everyone is boxing.
00:26:54.840,00:26:56.080,Copy.
00:27:05.720,00:27:06.600,Copy.
00:27:14.000,00:27:17.600,"Okay, Pierre, we just gained 20 seconds."
00:27:19.880,00:27:22.400,- Which position are we now? - P3.
00:27:34.720,00:27:38.200,"- When you stop, go to P3. - Copy."
00:27:51.720,00:27:53.560,"Okay, Pierre, you know the target now."
00:27:53.640,00:27:57.200,"Yeah, it's good for us to just fucking push and see what we get."
00:28:00.840,00:28:03.800,"In Formula 1, you never know what can happen."
00:28:07.000,00:28:10.040,There is no way I'm gonna miss this opportunity.
00:28:32.560,00:28:34.600,"Okay, push, push. Push, push."
00:28:47.440,00:28:49.920,How is the rear slip and braking?
00:28:50.840,00:28:54.040,"Still all good on data, Pierre. Still all good on data."
00:29:22.880,00:29:25.640,"Head down, Pierre, head down. Keep focusing on the pace."
00:29:25.720,00:29:26.680,Copy.
00:29:38.680,00:29:40.240,Tell me the gap behind.
00:29:40.920,00:29:43.920,"Sainz, 2.1 behind and Stroll is two behind him."
00:29:44.600,00:29:46.800,"Seven laps to go, seven laps."
00:29:55.720,00:30:17.400,"I don't know if we have more power, Winning a Formula 1 race was one of my dreams since I started to watch F1 when I was five years old."
00:30:17.960,00:30:26.120,"But to win a Formula 1 race, being in a midfield car, you've got to risk everything."
00:30:39.920,00:30:42.160,Two more laps. Two more laps.
00:30:43.920,00:30:45.520,"Okay, push, push. Push, push."
00:30:51.960,00:30:55.040,Sainz is charging the battery to prepare to attack.
00:30:55.120,00:30:56.160,We can defend.
00:31:09.960,00:31:11.960,Last lap. One more lap.
00:31:42.120,00:31:43.120,Oh my God!
00:31:43.760,00:31:45.320,What did we just do?
00:31:45.400,00:31:48.160,- What did you do? - We won the fucking race!
00:31:50.680,00:31:51.720,Oh my God!
00:31:53.280,00:31:55.160,"Oh my God, guys. We did it!"
00:31:56.640,00:31:58.240,Oh my God! Yes!
00:32:00.400,00:32:01.880,"P1, Pierre, P1!"
00:32:03.960,00:32:11.280,"AlphaTauri, Honda, all the engineers, all the mechanics, everybody in Faenza, thanks to you, we… we did it."
00:32:11.360,00:32:12.360,We did it!
00:32:12.960,00:32:14.000,Yeah!
00:33:07.000,00:33:11.680,"Okay, so, finishing order, uh, was Gasly, Sainz, Stroll."
00:33:12.840,00:33:14.440,We were P15.
00:33:16.120,00:33:17.680,"Okay. Sorry, guys."
00:34:02.320,00:34:04.840,This is such an amazing moment.
00:34:05.440,00:34:07.840,A moment I dreamed about for so many years.
00:34:25.840,00:34:28.120,"I just thought, Okay, we've done it."
00:34:28.840,00:34:30.640,What more do I need to prove?
00:34:44.040,00:34:46.560,"I know, in life, you… you have many obstacles."
00:34:48.440,00:34:53.520,"After the Red Bull demotion, I had to face a big challenge."
00:34:56.080,00:34:57.680,I had to rebuild myself.
00:35:00.720,00:35:04.560,"But it's only my third season in F1, so I'm better than last year."
00:35:07.360,00:35:11.560,"2021 is gonna be a better Pierre, and 2022 is gonna be an even better Pierre."
00:35:12.480,00:35:14.240,Ready to give my very best...
00:35:16.840,00:35:19.080,…to bring this team as much success as I can.
00:35:22.800,00:35:24.800,I need to call my parents as well.
00:35:24.880,00:35:28.880,"Have you heard them? Fuck, I cannot imagine how they are right now."
00:00:29.920,00:00:32.560,has now replaced Pierre Gasly at Red Bull.
00:00:39.360,00:00:41.080,Did you get any advance warning?
00:01:30.400,00:01:33.360,Is it the jacket with the trousers or the jacket with jeans?
00:01:43.360,00:01:44.280,Get this.
00:02:14.720,00:02:16.600,It is a solid midfield team.
00:02:16.680,00:02:24.000,Its only reason for existing over the past decade was as a Formula 1 school for Red Bull's young drivers.
00:02:28.960,00:02:30.960,has completely transformed.
00:02:40.680,00:02:42.320,"Now, can Gasly keep his foot in?"
00:02:42.400,00:02:44.720,"He can, to get past the Ferrari driver."
00:02:53.000,00:02:57.480,But every driver that races at AlphaTauri doesn't see their future at AlphaTauri.
00:02:58.640,00:03:03.120,It's a team where you prove your worth to Red Bull Racing.
00:03:12.120,00:03:13.440,"This is a bit small, no?"
00:03:43.320,00:03:49.400,"located deep in Belgium's Ardennes Forest, one of the oldest Grand Prix circuits in the world."
00:04:05.120,00:04:08.520,when the Red Bull team dropped Pierre Gasly from their second seat.
00:04:10.160,00:04:11.080,-Here he is. -Morning.
00:04:11.160,00:04:12.320,-Morning. -Morning.
00:05:18.000,00:05:25.120,"I think Formula 1 is highly personal, highly political, so, when it comes to Pierre, he has a massive point to prove."
00:05:50.640,00:05:52.840,"to have, one day, Pierre Gasly back at Red Bull?"
00:05:57.880,00:06:00.120,"and of course, we monitor his progress."
00:06:01.400,00:06:04.560,"To drive for Red Bull, this team is all about delivering."
00:06:04.640,00:06:09.320,"Obviously, we have a lot of information on how he's performing and developing."
00:06:10.280,00:06:15.520,"Pierre's driven some good races this year, but he's also shown dips as well."
00:06:21.520,00:06:22.440,without Red Bull.
00:06:22.520,00:06:31.080,"And the reality is, when you get there, if you can't cope with the pressure and scrutiny, you're never gonna make it at the highest level in… in Formula 1."
00:06:38.160,00:06:40.160,I feel people are gonna critique my shaving.
00:06:40.240,00:06:43.640,"You know, I've got that kind of like puberty fluffy beard."
00:06:47.680,00:06:52.480,"I've never been taught how to shave, so, um, if anyone wants to sponsor me, Gillette…?"
00:06:52.600,00:06:54.160,Gillette or Nivea.
00:06:54.240,00:06:55.760,Nivea aftershave.
00:06:55.840,00:07:03.600,"I would say, based on your ability to grow a beard, aim for the aftershave products as opposed to the actual shaving products."
00:07:19.880,00:07:25.320,"We're not even halfway through the season yet, and I still feel very… very new to the sport."
00:07:33.520,00:07:34.840,…but not great.
00:07:35.440,00:07:39.360,Everyone at Red Bull would have expected at least a podium by now.
00:07:46.480,00:07:49.360,to try and find the confidence in this car that Max has.
00:07:52.120,00:07:55.560,"Arguably, it's been a harder car than last year."
00:07:56.400,00:08:01.160,And he's up against Verstappen who is just in unbelievable form.
00:08:55.000,00:08:57.040,but it doesn't mean that I'm here to stay.
00:08:58.360,00:09:02.920,"You know, as a Red Bull driver, you're expected to be getting podiums, getting wins."
00:09:06.760,00:09:10.520,"It doesn't feel like he's enjoying driving the car, the balance that he's got."
00:09:12.800,00:09:22.240,"Yeah, he's not been comfy in it. I… It's starting to be a bit of a pattern of… We just need him to get the… to hit the ground running earlier."
00:09:23.440,00:09:26.400,And then everything to just be easier for him.
00:11:48.560,00:11:54.120,There's only two teams in the last ten years that have won World Championships and that's Red Bull and Mercedes.
00:11:55.640,00:12:03.680,"And I genuinely think that we have an outside chance, but we need both drivers to maximize the opportunity from the car."
00:12:12.120,00:12:19.440,The pressure is gonna be on Alex and the best way he can get around that is to get his first podium.
00:12:24.560,00:12:27.440,Daniel Ricciardo is fourth ahead of Alex Albon in fifth.
00:12:28.040,00:12:30.600,Pierre Gasly starts 12th for AlphaTauri.
00:12:30.680,00:12:33.960,He'll have his work cut out to get anything in this race.
00:13:23.400,00:13:25.880,and that's enabled Ocon to get ahead of him.
00:15:44.760,00:15:45.880,and he gets it done.
00:15:53.240,00:15:54.880,Mercedes one-two.
00:15:55.400,00:16:02.840,"It's third place for Max Verstappen, and Alex Albon just holds onto sixth, losing out on yet another podium."
00:16:02.920,00:16:04.640,Just couldn't make an impact.
00:16:08.680,00:16:13.240,gaining four positions to eighth place and Driver of the Day as well.
00:16:58.320,00:17:02.320,"When things don't go well, I'm my harshest critic."
00:17:03.320,00:17:05.600,You can't… You can't hide it.
00:17:06.920,00:17:08.640,It's just really tough.
00:17:09.240,00:17:13.360,There's no point feeling sorry for yourself and that's all there is to it.
00:17:21.200,00:17:25.360,"Dude, if it wasn't for social distancing, I'd give you a hug. What an amazing drive."
00:17:32.120,00:17:42.600,"I was like, If he keeps going, we're both in the wall, and I'm just fucking going for it, so… It's such a strange place for Gasly to be in."
00:17:46.280,00:17:50.760,He's still got a point to prove and he still wants that Red Bull seat.
00:17:54.080,00:17:57.320,"for your future career, from you being dropped by Red Bull?"
00:17:59.760,00:18:05.120,"I've always believed as long as you put strong performances, sooner or later, opportunities will come."
00:18:35.800,00:18:45.120,"Pierre? Um… Well, I think he's… he's, uh, performing well at AlphaTauri, but I think we're, you know, we're happy with the way things are."
00:18:49.720,00:18:50.840,See you next week.
00:18:52.160,00:18:54.880,"Helmut and I looked at, you know, the information."
00:18:55.920,00:18:58.360,"Our decisions, they're not just made on emotion."
00:18:58.440,00:19:00.040,They're based on facts.
00:19:06.960,00:19:14.640,"From a team point of view, there's been nobody pushing internally to say, We've gotta have Pierre back."
00:19:25.560,00:19:28.400,It's round eight of the Formula 1 World Championship.
00:19:28.480,00:19:30.920,Nowhere excites quite like Monza.
00:19:37.840,00:19:42.080,it's time to say thank you at the Williams family's final race.
00:19:47.680,00:19:48.800,Do you need a PA?
00:20:25.480,00:20:30.600,"but Christian and the whole team, they've been very supportive of you, publicly at least."
00:20:34.480,00:20:36.200,Is maybe that what you need?
00:20:36.720,00:20:38.760,You think you can fight towards the podium?
00:20:39.760,00:20:48.600,"It could be that Red Bull genuinely believe that Alex is the one, that Alex has the potential that Pierre didn't."
00:20:52.000,00:20:54.360,I don't think we've seen the best of him yet.
00:20:54.440,00:20:58.000,"Uh, we have no interest in… in having Pierre back, you know, this season."
00:20:58.080,00:21:07.000,"On the other hand, it could just be that… they cannot bring themselves to admit that they made a mistake."
00:23:03.720,00:23:06.880,He knows the pressure that he's under to deliver a result.
00:23:07.760,00:23:13.840,He needs to get a little bit more of that fuck you attitude that you see the great drivers have.
00:23:19.040,00:23:23.880,"to… to kind of show the big bosses, really, that you're there to be in Formula 1."
00:23:28.880,00:23:32.560,desperate to end this run without a podium for the Red Bull driver.
00:23:32.640,00:23:35.360,He's alongside Pierre Gasly in tenth place.
00:24:35.120,00:24:36.280,"Oh, contact!"
00:24:40.000,00:24:41.480,Gasly gets past him.
00:24:55.040,00:24:57.040,and losing places as a result.
00:25:44.040,00:25:45.400,"Push, push. Push, push."
00:26:45.080,00:26:47.720,for pitting when the pit-lane entry was closed.
00:26:49.080,00:26:51.520,"And now, the pit-lane entry is open."
00:27:09.520,00:27:13.920,"Pierre Gasly pitted way before, so he's a massive gainer in this."
00:27:25.720,00:27:28.440,We're red-flagging the race. It's basically a reset.
00:27:28.960,00:27:30.880,Incredible scenes at Monza.
00:27:30.960,00:27:34.200,Pierre Gasly is in an unbelievable position right now.
00:28:27.120,00:28:28.560,Gasly up to second place.
00:29:03.240,00:29:06.320,It's a ten-second stop-and-go penalty for Lewis Hamilton.
00:29:06.840,00:29:07.800,And he's coming in.
00:29:07.880,00:29:13.280,Hamilton into the pit lane from the lead of the race to serve his ten-second stop-and-go penalty.
00:29:35.600,00:29:36.920,Sainz closing in.
00:29:57.440,00:29:59.080,"but if we have, let's use it."
00:30:06.600,00:30:09.880,You don't know in Formula 1. You've got to take your opportunities.
00:30:36.840,00:30:39.000,Gasly is under so much pressure.
00:31:23.840,00:31:25.640,but he's not gonna get close enough.
00:31:48.680,00:31:49.840,Yes!
00:32:27.320,00:32:31.520,"so perceptions can change very, very quickly."
00:32:32.800,00:32:34.840,Pierre has done an excellent job.
00:32:35.360,00:32:37.480,He's driving like he has nothing to lose.
00:33:24.720,00:33:27.000,…the situation with Alex is very clear.
00:33:27.520,00:33:35.320,"That race was a disaster for him, so we need to see Alex really grab that seat and make it his own."
00:33:37.680,00:33:50.760,"The problem is if he doesn't, then, you know, we need to look outside and think, Okay, if Alex isn't gonna make that next step, who do we put alongside Max for 2021?"
00:35:41.200,00:35:43.400,"I'm wheeling and dealing, Gene, to stay alive."
00:35:43.480,00:35:48.320,The German sponsors want German drivers. I will decide which driver goes this week.
00:35:50.520,00:35:52.160,He needs to step it up.
00:35:52.240,00:35:55.040,"If he doesn't, there are gonna be some difficult decisions to be made."
00:35:57.080,00:35:58.920,He doesn't want to leave Formula 1.
00:00:06.000,00:00:07.760,-Is Gene here? -No.
00:00:07.840,00:00:10.720,"For Americans, to travel is difficult, you know?"
00:00:10.800,00:00:13.040,"-Lucky for you, isn't it? -Fucking hell, yeah."
00:00:13.120,00:00:16.560,"Yeah, I have to speak with him every fucking day. He doesn't stop."
00:00:24.160,00:00:28.840,"I said to you, as long as we can afford what you said to me, I'm trying to… I'm doing my best."
00:00:34.120,00:00:35.600,"Okay, gonna fix it, you know?"
00:00:35.680,00:00:38.000,"That is what we need to do every day, Gene."
00:00:39.320,00:00:42.000,"I'm wheeling and dealing at the moment, to stay alive."
00:00:42.080,00:00:44.480,How do you sum up your season this year?
00:00:51.960,00:00:52.840,What the fuck?
00:00:52.920,00:00:54.840,Fucking hell. Who was that?
00:00:58.680,00:01:00.040,Brakes gone.
00:01:06.520,00:01:08.480,"-Sorry, guys. -Fuck me!"
00:01:23.400,00:01:24.680,"Thank you, bye."
00:01:25.280,00:01:26.320,Fucking hell.
00:01:35.200,00:01:36.480,Like a professional.
00:01:55.320,00:01:57.080,"Good day to be back to work, huh?"
00:02:03.920,00:02:06.080,"Man, we should be fucking surfing."
00:02:31.360,00:02:34.200,"-It's fully the sun now, huh? -Want an umbrella?"
00:02:34.280,00:02:35.720,"No, fuck off!"
00:02:35.800,00:02:37.360,"That would hurt my ego, you know."
00:02:38.360,00:02:42.960,"Standing there with an umbrella… -Wouldn't do much for my ego either. -Yeah, fucking hell."
00:02:43.040,00:02:45.880,It's a little bit of sun and I need an umbrella.
00:03:08.200,00:03:10.480,"-Cheers, guys. Thank you. -I'm knackered now."
00:03:40.480,00:03:42.600,-How's the hand? -Getting there.
00:03:42.680,00:03:44.560,-Is it painful? -Aches.
00:04:22.320,00:04:25.760,What do you listen to on your headphones before each race?
00:04:39.760,00:04:41.520,"Kevin, what do you listen to?"
00:04:59.120,00:05:00.320,Where's the driver?
00:05:00.920,00:05:03.000,He's on his way. He's on his last interview.
00:05:20.760,00:05:23.440,"-Hey, Romain. You alright? -Yeah."
00:05:24.320,00:05:26.140,How was your holiday? Was it alright?
00:05:37.320,00:05:39.260,What about you? Do any drinking?
00:06:32.160,00:06:33.720,I need to go to the press pen.
00:06:33.800,00:06:36.120,-You have three minutes. -Got it.
00:06:36.200,00:06:42.120,Guenther is a colleague and I am spending more time in my life with my colleagues than with my wife.
00:06:43.280,00:06:44.920,How many assistants have you got?
00:06:45.000,00:06:46.480,I have nobody because I have no money.
00:06:46.560,00:06:48.640,You've got three people running around you.
00:06:48.720,00:06:51.720,-Yeah. -Another one coming. Four now.
00:06:51.800,00:06:59.640,"We can fight on track, we can fight on drivers, but at the end, we are doing the same business and we can sit down together and have a coffee."
00:07:56.160,00:07:59.920,"So, I do the countdown and then, if you'd like to smile."
00:08:00.000,00:08:01.920,"Three, two, one."
00:08:03.080,00:08:03.920,Thanks a lot.
00:08:06.840,00:08:08.600,Are you a fan of interviews?
00:08:27.760,00:08:31.120,"Give me your smile in three, two, one."
00:08:32.000,00:08:33.080,Perfect.
00:08:34.240,00:08:36.400,-Giovinazzi! -Ciao!
00:08:36.480,00:08:38.200,-Hello. -All good?
00:08:38.280,00:08:39.120,Yes.
00:08:39.200,00:08:40.840,"I can't see you, Giovinazzi."
00:08:40.920,00:08:43.240,I'm here. Good evening.
00:08:49.040,00:08:50.800,What will you eat tonight?
00:08:50.880,00:08:54.080,"I don't know. Maybe rice, salmon and avocado."
00:09:06.840,00:09:08.880,Are you going out on your bike?
00:09:08.960,00:09:12.880,Yes. Sometimes I cycle. The weather is nice over here.
00:09:26.120,00:09:27.920,Are you tired?
00:09:28.000,00:09:29.840,I will eat and go to bed.
00:09:29.920,00:09:31.040,Perfect.
00:09:31.120,00:09:33.320,"Okay, take care. Goodbye."
00:09:33.400,00:09:35.880,-Good night. Bye. -Bye. Good night. Bye.
00:10:02.800,00:10:03.800,And finish.
00:10:04.480,00:10:06.400,Starting with this one.
00:10:06.480,00:10:10.520,"For me, the main thing this season is that I show to my boss my talent."
00:10:10.600,00:10:12.960,It's my dream to score a podium with them.
00:10:13.480,00:10:20.120,"You know, an Italian driver, in, uh… with an Italian brand like Alfa Romeo in a podium, so this is my dream."
00:10:22.560,00:10:27.080,Everybody is supportive behind him to try to get the best from Antonio.
00:10:28.320,00:10:33.200,"But at the end, you have to perform and if you don't do it, you will lose your seat."
00:10:34.760,00:10:35.840,That's life.
00:11:14.400,00:11:18.160,RG hasn't finished the last five Grand Prix here.
00:11:18.760,00:11:20.880,I just fucking want him to finish the race.
00:11:21.680,00:11:25.400,"-Radio check, Romain. -Yeah, radio is very good."
00:11:28.360,00:11:31.560,"-Radio check, loud and clear. -Yeah, loud and clear."
00:11:33.680,00:11:36.160,"Okay, Kevin, have a great race."
00:12:18.800,00:12:19.760,Great job.
00:12:38.120,00:12:39.960,He didn't even do one lap!
00:12:40.520,00:12:41.800,Is Kevin okay?
00:12:42.320,00:12:43.720,"Yeah, Kevin's okay."
00:12:54.200,00:12:56.840,Keep pushing to close the gap to Vettel.
00:12:59.720,00:13:01.920,"Antonio, we are currently P13."
00:13:03.480,00:13:05.240,"And behind, we have Grosjean."
00:13:06.320,00:13:08.760,"This is awesome, dude. Really good pace here."
00:13:09.360,00:13:11.240,"Yeah, I'm pushing as hard as I can."
00:13:14.640,00:13:16.920,-Box this lap. -Copy.
00:13:25.560,00:13:27.880,Fucking just pit when everyone else pits!
00:13:27.960,00:13:29.080,Fucking hell!
00:13:30.440,00:13:32.560,I'm focusing on time right now.
00:13:33.080,00:13:34.920,Get as many positions as I can.
00:13:42.840,00:13:45.600,"Okay, boys. The front left is really struggling."
00:13:46.640,00:13:47.960,Fuck's sake!
00:13:54.360,00:13:56.640,"Good job so far. Keep pushing, Antonio."
00:13:56.720,00:13:59.120,We slightly closed the gap to the guys ahead.
00:14:09.720,00:14:11.680,I really don't know what I can do.
00:14:18.680,00:14:20.760,"The rear tires, they're going on me."
00:14:21.280,00:14:23.680,"Please tell him, just stay calm. Calm him down."
00:14:29.120,00:14:31.000,We're gonna get done again in a minute.
00:14:39.440,00:14:40.920,"Box, Romain, box."
00:15:04.240,00:15:05.320,Are you kidding me?
00:15:08.000,00:15:09.320,What the fuck?
00:15:18.960,00:15:21.080,Why couldn't I engage first?
00:15:21.600,00:15:23.080,We will check. We will check.
00:15:23.600,00:15:26.640,-We're last now. -We are fucking last.
00:15:32.040,00:15:34.480,"Good job, Antonio. We are P14."
00:15:35.960,00:15:37.720,The last two corners. Good job.
00:15:42.520,00:15:44.320,Well done. Excellent race.
00:15:45.240,00:15:47.000,"Yeah, thank you very much."
00:15:55.960,00:15:58.040,"Yeah, dude, that's the checker."
00:15:58.640,00:16:00.000,"I'm sorry, guys."
00:16:01.400,00:16:02.400,Sorry.
00:16:05.720,00:16:09.280,"Normally, when you drive into the pit, you go straight to first gear."
00:16:09.360,00:16:10.640,He went into neutral.
00:16:11.240,00:16:13.440,"He fucked it up, you know. It's his fault, yeah."
00:16:13.520,00:16:16.600,"Oh well, I guess we weren't getting points anyway."
00:16:16.680,00:16:17.760,No.
00:16:38.480,00:16:40.200,"Hi, Gene. Did you watch us?"
00:16:41.080,00:16:42.000,"Oh, yeah."
00:16:42.080,00:16:44.600,Front and rear suspension is for sure broken.
00:16:45.200,00:16:46.080,Fucking hell.
00:16:47.600,00:16:49.040,And did you see with Romain?
00:16:49.560,00:16:52.600,"No, no, no, no, no. He fucked the pit stop up."
00:16:52.680,00:16:55.560,"Otherwise we would have finished 11th, Gene, 10th or 11th."
00:16:55.640,00:16:57.600,We would have been in front of Vettel.
00:16:57.680,00:17:00.360,No. No. No.
00:17:01.040,00:17:04.360,I don't want to spend more money on this team at the moment.
00:17:04.440,00:17:05.920,You need to find a sponsor.
00:17:06.000,00:17:07.320,Yeah. Mm-hmm.
00:17:07.400,00:17:10.000,"All right, Gene. No. I'll speak with you in the week."
00:17:10.080,00:17:11.040,"Thank you, Gene."
00:17:11.120,00:17:12.640,Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye.
00:17:35.040,00:17:37.040,The presentation is ready now.
00:17:37.800,00:17:39.960,How did you say you were gonna do it?
00:17:40.040,00:17:43.520,-I don't have my adapter. -They must have an adapter there.
00:17:44.240,00:17:48.200,I was thinking we say this is 15 million US dollars.
00:17:48.280,00:17:51.120,"As long as I have the $15 million, I'm okay."
00:18:05.160,00:18:07.160,Let's just walk and say hello.
00:18:07.240,00:18:09.280,"-Hello, Mr. Steiner. -Afternoon."
00:18:18.560,00:18:27.760,The drivers have also sent you a little greeting and I got it signed by both Haas drivers.
00:18:30.200,00:18:31.480,"Great, thank you."
00:18:32.840,00:18:34.760,-A warm welcome here. -Thank you.
00:18:35.360,00:18:38.200,It is important to me that we are included along the way.
00:18:38.280,00:18:43.920,"And the question here is, how can you include us so we will learn to trust the team?"
00:18:53.840,00:18:58.800,"Maybe it's not just the sponsor that's new, but maybe you also have a German driver."
00:19:01.320,00:19:03.880,This is enormously important for us.
00:19:23.800,00:19:26.080,I don't want to promise anything I can't do.
00:19:26.160,00:19:32.640,"I can… I'm not saying it's a yes, but… I mean, there are possibilities, you know."
00:19:35.800,00:19:37.800,"-Okay, great. -Thank you."
00:19:37.880,00:19:40.160,Bye. See you next time. Bye. Thank you.
00:19:40.240,00:19:41.440,Thank you for your time.
00:19:41.520,00:19:42.640,Bye. Thank you.
00:22:37.160,00:22:40.400,I knew that Mick was part of the Ferrari Driver Academy.
00:22:40.480,00:22:47.560,"I was already watching him in, in F3, two years ago or three years ago."
00:22:49.440,00:22:52.280,I'm a competitor. We always want to get more.
00:22:54.720,00:22:57.520,"If you are happy with what you have, then you are dead."
00:23:12.560,00:23:16.360,"Gene, I'm working on the deal as we said, you need to trust me on that."
00:23:17.280,00:23:21.040,"Having a German driver for a German sponsor, obviously, is crucial."
00:23:25.480,00:23:29.480,"Because he's very sellable, you know, and that's what my point is."
00:23:29.560,00:23:32.640,"If I've got Schumacher, I think I can find some more money, Gene."
00:23:32.720,00:23:34.600,-It's good to have money. -Yeah.
00:23:34.680,00:23:38.560,"So, if we get Schumacher, I think I can… I can find some."
00:23:39.240,00:23:42.120,I hope three million. Between three and five million more.
00:23:42.200,00:23:44.480,"So, we have got a very good budget, you know."
00:24:26.240,00:24:29.520,"These days, for young boys..."
00:24:31.480,00:24:34.400,...it is impossible to make it into F1.
00:24:43.360,00:24:44.960,You need to think of the future.
00:24:47.640,00:24:51.040,Put some money aside and think about another activity.
00:24:59.200,00:25:02.040,"I don't know the talks Mick had with Fred, or Fred had with Mick."
00:25:04.360,00:25:07.660,"I don't know that, but I just cannot wait around."
00:25:07.760,00:25:10.560,Let's do it this week. I want to use the momentum.
00:25:10.640,00:25:12.840,"No, we have to do it this week."
00:25:12.920,00:25:15.640,I have the offer on the table.
00:25:15.720,00:25:18.160,I just have to negotiate the numbers with him.
00:25:24.800,00:25:26.760,I should get a relatively quick answer.
00:25:29.440,00:25:31.840,"Hopefully, he will say this is okay for him."
00:25:33.120,00:25:34.920,"Okay, let's do that."
00:25:36.320,00:25:42.120,"A race is starting at two, then I can't sit here and be filmed by Netflix, you know."
00:25:43.080,00:25:44.720,Then I won't have a job anymore.
00:26:11.820,00:26:12.980,"Radio check, Kevin."
00:26:34.480,00:26:38.360,"If you want to go fast at this one, you've got to have balls."
00:26:38.440,00:26:41.840,You've got to have balls and you've got to know the track.
00:27:36.560,00:27:38.040,Fuck me!
00:27:38.640,00:27:40.200,I'm on fucking ice.
00:27:44.840,00:27:46.960,Fuck me. They have no grip.
00:28:06.040,00:28:10.680,I got hit badly by some gravel by Kimi and it's fucking hurting my finger.
00:28:11.680,00:28:12.600,Are you okay?
00:28:12.680,00:28:13.960,I don't know.
00:28:14.040,00:28:15.600,I can't use my left index.
00:28:16.360,00:28:17.720,I hope it's not broken.
00:28:31.400,00:28:33.560,"Good job, Antonio. Keep pushing."
00:28:38.840,00:28:41.760,Obviously heavy traffic. Impossible to overtake.
00:28:41.840,00:28:48.920,"Maybe we tell Romain he's doing the same time as the guys in front of him just to keep his, you know, spirit up, yeah."
00:28:51.640,00:28:53.960,Pace is really good. You're matching Gasly ahead.
00:28:54.040,00:28:55.920,"Good job, mate. Let's get him."
00:29:05.880,00:29:08.200,Oh my word. What happened there?
00:29:17.440,00:29:18.400,"Box, box."
00:29:19.240,00:29:20.200,Copy.
00:29:22.760,00:29:27.640,"Somehow we need to tell Romain that if he can do it on a one-stop, we have points, you know."
00:29:32.280,00:29:34.320,I think tires are still okay.
00:29:34.400,00:29:37.280,We are thinking of a variation on Plan B.
00:29:37.840,00:29:39.680,"Okay, think and I'll drive fast."
00:29:51.440,00:29:55.640,"Okay, dude, you're gonna be in free air, so let's push on these tires and get 'em going."
00:30:03.920,00:30:07.160,"Romain's P10 on his one-stop, ten seconds up the road."
00:30:07.240,00:30:09.000,Giovinazzi ahead is P11.
00:30:21.960,00:30:24.400,"We have Grosjean ahead, nine seconds."
00:30:25.120,00:30:26.040,Copy.
00:30:27.160,00:30:30.160,"Is he pushing flat out, Antonio, or what is he doing?"
00:30:30.240,00:30:31.760,He needs to fucking push.
00:30:41.640,00:30:42.760,These laps are good.
00:30:42.840,00:30:46.000,You're a second quicker than Hülkenberg ahead. Let's get him.
00:30:48.440,00:30:50.800,"Fuck, that's good times for Romain."
00:30:50.880,00:30:52.400,What's happened to Magnussen?
00:30:55.760,00:30:57.560,Come on. Come on!
00:30:57.640,00:30:59.760,"Okay, Kevin, currently P11."
00:31:00.480,00:31:01.720,Vettel's behind us.
00:31:01.800,00:31:03.440,Mode push. Mode push.
00:31:25.800,00:31:27.880,"Kevin, push like hell to the end."
00:31:27.960,00:31:29.360,-Let's keep going. -Okay.
00:31:32.920,00:31:35.440,"Romain, five laps to go, 1.3 back to Gio."
00:31:35.520,00:31:38.480,He's got Vettel behind him. He'll come under pressure soon.
00:31:38.560,00:31:40.520,Grosjean ahead. Keep pushing.
00:31:41.080,00:31:44.920,"It's important to get Grosjean, otherwise we risk to get out of the points."
00:31:45.000,00:31:45.960,Come on!
00:31:49.680,00:31:52.240,"Three more laps to go, Kevin. Three laps."
00:32:09.960,00:32:12.120,"That is the checker, mate. P9."
00:32:12.200,00:32:14.240,"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!"
00:32:14.320,00:32:15.720,"Yes, guys, yes!"
00:32:16.920,00:32:19.880,"-Well done, Antonio. P10. -Thank you."
00:32:19.960,00:32:23.160,"Checkered flag, Kevin. Checkered flag. P13."
00:32:23.680,00:32:25.640,Sorry it didn't go quite right at the end.
00:32:25.720,00:32:27.160,"Yeah, good job, guys."
00:32:27.960,00:32:31.800,"Thank you for the work and, yeah, you're the boys. You're the boys."
00:32:31.880,00:32:33.800,"Thanks to everybody. Great job, Romain."
00:32:33.880,00:32:36.960,"Thank you, guys. Thank you for never giving up."
00:32:38.120,00:32:40.500,"Yeah, Guenther, that's not something we do, giving up."
00:33:06.480,00:33:08.520,"Nice one, good work."
00:33:09.960,00:33:13.240,Well done. We beat everyone that we needed to beat.
00:33:22.440,00:33:23.720,Is it broken?
00:33:44.000,00:33:47.240,"-All right, so, forward planning. -Forward planning."
00:33:47.320,00:33:49.720,-What do you know? -What do I know?
00:33:49.800,00:33:51.840,What do you know? What can you tell me?
00:33:52.360,00:33:54.320,Where are the balls in the air?
00:33:54.400,00:33:56.560,"-Circus. -Circus, yeah. Clowns."
00:33:56.640,00:33:58.240,Circus. Formula 1.
00:33:59.960,00:34:03.600,"So, anyway, I will decide which driver goes this week."
00:34:09.320,00:34:11.360,"You know, it will be quite emotional."
00:34:11.440,00:34:17.760,"You know, in an ideal world, my plan would be that we make that official the Portugal weekend."
00:34:23.720,00:34:25.040,You want my job?
00:34:25.720,00:34:27.040,Wouldn't take the pay cut.
00:35:04.720,00:35:07.160,"In a way, exciting as well, but mostly weird."
00:35:07.240,00:35:09.760,Gonna miss the feeling of Formula 1.
00:35:47.680,00:35:54.000,"-Anyhoo… -Yeah, I mean, bottom line is everyone knows you're gonna drive the absolute nuts off of this car until the end of the season."
00:35:54.080,00:35:56.840,-You won't take your foot off the gas. -Absolutely.
00:36:18.200,00:36:21.880,"I'm not really done with Formula 1, but maybe Formula 1's done with me."
00:37:06.160,00:37:08.000,I just have to say hello to him.
00:37:08.720,00:37:11.120,-Are you still saying hello to me? -Huh?
00:37:11.200,00:37:12.600,-Still saying hello? -Yeah.
00:37:12.680,00:37:15.000,"I know that, yeah. I'm just joking."
00:37:15.880,00:37:18.440,"It seems to have been managed pretty good, you know."
00:37:18.520,00:37:22.480,"As we said, we are not damaging anybody. That's the last thing I want to do."
00:37:22.560,00:37:23.880,You know that I mean that.
00:37:23.960,00:37:25.760,-Because otherwise… -For sure.
00:37:25.840,00:37:29.560,"-It's never nice, but hey. -Yeah."
00:37:29.640,00:37:31.960,"Life is not ein Wunschkonzert, as we say in German."
00:37:32.040,00:37:33.560,"You know? Fucking hell, yeah."
00:37:39.040,00:37:41.520,You've got rid of your sort of two adopted sons.
00:37:41.600,00:37:43.600,"So, what's next? Who's coming in?"
00:39:00.920,00:39:03.440,"Okay, Carlos. No fight with Lando. Let him go."
00:39:03.520,00:39:04.360,Fucking hell.
00:39:04.440,00:39:07.200,He just turned in on me. What's he trying to do?
00:39:08.000,00:39:09.600,I'm pretty angry.
00:39:14.440,00:39:17.920,"Once you see fire, that's the worst thing you can have."
00:39:18.000,00:39:20.720,You don't think anybody can get out alive of this one.
00:00:24.160,00:00:33.480,"I said to you, as long as we can afford what you said to me, I'm trying to… I'm doing my best …as a team."
00:00:44.560,00:00:46.120,It's one short word.
00:01:12.080,00:01:16.760,"You know, just week after week after week of constantly losing is just not easy to do."
00:01:16.840,00:01:18.520,We can't keep running in the back.
00:01:18.600,00:01:22.800,"I don't want to necessarily win, but I want to be competitive once in a while."
00:01:26.400,00:01:29.280,"If I don't do a… a good job, I should be gone."
00:01:29.800,00:01:32.760,"If you are not good enough, you will be, uh, spat out."
00:01:33.720,00:01:34.560,Action.
00:02:00.400,00:02:02.960,we welcome you to the British Grand Prix.
00:02:19.320,00:02:24.600,"I know, but some desserts, like, let's be honest, ice cream, you could just keep picking and eat the whole tub."
00:02:51.040,00:02:52.800,"back up, then carry on for another five."
00:02:54.720,00:02:58.080,I think being a small team has got its advantages and disadvantages.
00:02:58.160,00:03:01.400,"One of the advantages, it's more like everybody knows each other."
00:03:01.480,00:03:02.600,Like family.
00:03:16.880,00:03:18.760,in terms of staff turnover.
00:03:18.840,00:03:20.840,It's like Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.
00:03:22.960,00:03:25.440,"Nobody ever goes in, nobody ever comes out."
00:03:26.320,00:03:29.480,"Romain and Kevin have been with us for, uh, for a long time now."
00:03:29.560,00:03:38.360,"Romain was there from day one and Kevin joined us in our second year and, uh, especially in Formula 1, I don't think there's many drivers which have been so long with a team."
00:03:45.600,00:03:48.880,I'm Kevin Magnussen and this is Drive to Survive Season 3.
00:03:55.880,00:03:59.920,Haas has been my home in Formula 1 for the last four years.
00:04:00.560,00:04:04.520,"When you spend four years with a team, you become close with everyone."
00:04:07.480,00:04:09.920,They have questions for you both.
00:04:12.880,00:04:21.160,"I know what the team needs and what they want from me, so it… it helps you, as a driver, perform better when you have that around you."
00:04:28.280,00:04:30.920,I've heard Romain listen to Taylor Swift before the race.
00:04:36.800,00:04:39.120,"It's been… it's really good, you know?"
00:04:51.720,00:04:55.800,"uh, since… since day one and always wanted us to do better and better."
00:05:28.160,00:05:33.680,"After a very strong 2018, the team started going down, racing for the last position."
00:05:34.200,00:05:36.720,"Now, we have absolutely no chance to be on the podium."
00:05:46.240,00:05:47.760,"instead, he came out miles behind."
00:05:49.640,00:05:56.440,"but you also… you get a stronger bond in the team between everyone, and… and that will make us better in… for the future."
00:06:01.520,00:06:07.120,"it's very tight between ourselves and Alfa, so, obviously, the potential to get out Q1 is there."
00:06:07.200,00:06:11.360,"Um, and, obviously that's the main aim for… for us in this respect."
00:06:12.880,00:06:15.440,"Our main rivals, they are Alfa Romeo."
00:06:15.520,00:06:19.320,I think the rest of the midfield is… is a touch too far ahead.
00:06:22.880,00:06:25.160,"If they're doing better, I'm not getting upset."
00:06:25.240,00:06:32.080,"Some you win, some you lose. But I think they play always fair and, uh, it's… for sure, it's not good to… to lose against them."
00:07:04.640,00:07:07.120,Fred and myself are in very similar positions.
00:07:07.200,00:07:09.800,"We are, I would say, the only independent teams now."
00:07:09.880,00:07:13.040,"He's got an owner, I've got an owner, so we compare the notes."
00:07:15.160,00:07:18.680,Haas and Alfa Romeo are incredibly close competitors in all regards.
00:07:18.760,00:07:25.840,"Not only do they share the same engine provider, but their annual budget is probably around the same figure."
00:07:28.120,00:07:31.120,But Alfa Romeo have world champion Kimi Räikkönen.
00:07:36.440,00:07:37.600,Kimi Räikkönen.
00:07:39.320,00:07:43.080,I'm Kimi Räikkönen and I drive for Alfa Romeo Racing.
00:07:47.960,00:07:53.200,"He's got the expertise, the consistency, a little bit more experience he can bring to the team."
00:08:04.440,00:08:06.760,But he's a funny character to try and read.
00:08:08.680,00:08:09.760,Never been.
00:08:10.480,00:08:11.360,Still not so.
00:08:15.280,00:08:21.320,"In the other seat is one of Ferrari's junior drivers, Antonio Giovinazzi."
00:08:26.200,00:08:27.680,a good long time.
00:08:46.560,00:08:48.960,"is always, You look so skinny, you need to eat."
00:08:58.440,00:09:01.880,from a town in south of Italy called Martina Franca.
00:09:05.560,00:09:06.760,"Yes, yes, yes."
00:09:15.920,00:09:17.280,in the Formula 1 grid.
00:09:17.360,00:09:20.440,"Of course, also a little bit of pressure because I'm the only one."
00:09:20.520,00:09:26.040,"So, I want to do well for them, uh, but yeah, just, uh, in the end, I'm just really proud."
00:09:36.720,00:09:39.520,"He's… he's wicked quick, Antonio."
00:09:49.200,00:09:55.440,But he has some sort of wild and wacky moments where he loses control of the car.
00:09:58.320,00:10:01.440,"And it's a surprise that they keep him on, really, for 2020."
00:10:45.520,00:10:47.440,Haas have a lot to prove.
00:10:52.800,00:10:59.160,"A small team like ours is supported by investors and in times like this, they doubt everything."
00:11:06.160,00:11:12.080,"There's a lot on the table, but it… it is not anything that a great race could be changed."
00:12:00.200,00:12:02.280,Magnussen has already passed Albon.
00:12:14.840,00:12:18.280,"especially on that first lap, you'll get overtaken so easily."
00:12:49.120,00:12:50.480,It's not what you want.
00:13:22.360,00:13:24.200,Apart from Romain Grosjean.
00:13:39.400,00:13:42.320,but he's going to be really slow on those old tires.
00:14:01.920,00:14:03.720,He's just gonna keep plugging away.
00:14:27.240,00:14:29.040,The second McLaren is through.
00:14:44.480,00:14:47.920,This stop will be crucial to keep the Haas team in contention.
00:17:14.000,00:17:17.320,"I think, for sure, uh, Gene was not happy with the results."
00:17:17.840,00:17:19.800,It's a very expensive business.
00:17:19.880,00:17:22.280,"Money is, uh, less than it was before."
00:17:22.360,00:17:23.840,There is less income.
00:17:23.920,00:17:27.680,"So, we need to find outside financing to survive as a team."
00:17:52.600,00:17:58.720,"there's a negotiation with a very well-known company in Germany in the tech business, and that is the partners you want."
00:17:59.320,00:18:03.000,"It's very stressful, but I think Gene trusts me that I can pull it off."
00:18:12.560,00:18:18.480,"If a partner comes aboard, that would mean somebody shares the cost of going racing and we would be more than happy."
00:18:48.000,00:18:49.640,"as saying, Sponsor me, you know."
00:18:49.720,00:18:53.160,For sure there will be mandates to follow.
00:19:07.440,00:19:11.160,they want to have a little bit of influence also in the drivers.
00:19:12.000,00:19:15.960,"So, there is a lot to decide and to weigh up against each other."
00:19:16.040,00:19:23.280,"What is the best to do? And, uh, it needs some thinking and, uh, to… to make the right strategic decision."
00:19:56.120,00:20:05.720,"just keep the same two drivers and keep on going and, uh, have no worries, but there is a… a team which needs to be kept alive with the best talent and the best finances possible."
00:20:07.120,00:20:10.760,It's quite a big responsibility. There is sometimes tough decisions.
00:20:11.760,00:20:15.720,"Will be very difficult for me to do, to tell Romain or Kevin it's over."
00:20:16.880,00:20:18.000,They will be upset.
00:20:18.880,00:20:20.480,They are part of the family.
00:20:43.680,00:20:49.200,"rising star of Formula 2 and son of seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, is here."
00:20:56.280,00:20:57.360,Morning. How are you?
00:21:02.440,00:21:06.240,Fred Vasseur at Alfa Romeo is a very shrewd operator.
00:21:07.600,00:21:13.080,He also sees the kind of cash cow that Mick Schumacher could be in his team.
00:21:14.720,00:21:15.760,"Okay, that's fun."
00:21:20.600,00:21:26.800,"to win for the first time in Formula 2 I'm Mick Schumacher, I'm 21 years old, and I'm a racing driver."
00:21:29.400,00:21:31.080,My dad is Michael Schumacher.
00:21:31.160,00:21:33.960,He's seven-time world champion and he's the greatest.
00:21:34.040,00:21:36.360,"My dad is my idol, that's for sure."
00:21:40.560,00:21:47.760,"There are two teams which haven't, uh, announced their driver lineup yet, which are Alfa Romeo and Haas."
00:21:48.680,00:21:50.720,"So, yeah, we'll have to see."
00:21:53.560,00:22:01.080,"I'm here now this weekend with Alfa Romeo, just to get the insights to feel, Okay, how does a racing team really work on a race weekend?"
00:22:08.080,00:22:10.760,There's a lot of rumors surrounding the team.
00:22:11.760,00:22:14.880,"Um, driver market and..."
00:22:15.480,00:22:19.480,We're not focusing on any of those. We're just focusing on doing our job.
00:22:21.760,00:22:25.480,I know that Mick is there and Mick is doing well in Formula 2.
00:22:27.160,00:22:29.080,He is not my main focus now.
00:22:29.160,00:22:35.400,"My main focus is, uh, is doing well, and I'm sure if I'm doing well, I will, uh, I will be still here next year."
00:23:05.040,00:23:07.560,which doesn't mean he's next year in Alfa Romeo.
00:23:08.080,00:23:09.400,Doesn't mean anything.
00:23:49.040,00:23:53.320,"Mick, by winning the F2 championship, for sure, is a hot property."
00:23:53.400,00:23:57.960,"And with Mick, the other attraction is, uh, we all know who his father is."
00:24:00.080,00:24:02.000,But what can be done? I don't know yet.
00:25:04.360,00:25:07.680,"I don't know that, but I just cannot wait around."
00:25:21.360,00:25:24.720,"why he should come to us, and… and… and work on the deal."
00:25:53.680,00:25:55.560,when you have no idea what's going to happen.
00:25:56.080,00:26:00.400,"I have a very, very strong feeling the team is going to change one of us."
00:26:07.240,00:26:10.240,"But, obviously, I am not the one making the decision."
00:26:13.600,00:26:15.920,There has been competition from day one with Kevin.
00:26:17.840,00:26:18.920,He's tough on track.
00:26:29.720,00:26:31.240,Put some oil on the fire.
00:26:47.080,00:26:49.040,to try and stay in Formula 1 at this stage.
00:26:49.120,00:26:52.480,They'll be giving it everything. They certainly will.
00:26:56.400,00:26:58.440,Now we wait for the five red lights to go out.
00:26:58.520,00:27:01.600,"When they do, we will be racing at the Nürburgring."
00:27:17.840,00:27:21.560,"for 60 laps around the Nürburgring, it's the Eifel Grand Prix."
00:27:42.600,00:27:44.760,He's lost four places from the start.
00:27:57.960,00:27:59.280,And he's done it.
00:28:20.960,00:28:24.120,"In these cold temperatures, you'll probably feel it even more."
00:29:01.240,00:29:02.800,"Oh, he's got that wrong!"
00:29:02.880,00:29:05.360,That'll be the end of Russell's afternoon.
00:29:12.600,00:29:16.080,"and as a result of that, this could be pit-stop time."
00:29:44.440,00:29:50.480,"to come in for new tires, Grosjean looks like he's taking a gamble and staying out."
00:30:35.520,00:30:37.440,He's with the team all weekend.
00:31:09.120,00:31:11.240,Magnussen tries to cut back.
00:31:14.720,00:31:18.480,He's not going to give up that easily. That's audacious into turn four!
00:32:02.000,00:32:09.880,"to take his 91st Formula 1 victory, and first points of the year for Romain Grosjean What a brilliant drive."
00:32:57.120,00:33:03.760,"It felt really good, you know. Uh… For us, P9 is… is the absolute best on a… on a really good day."
00:33:25.440,00:33:27.160,"It's not broken, but it's blue."
00:34:41.960,00:34:49.040,Formula 1 arrives in Portimao for the 2020 Portuguese Grand Prix and a driver market has been kicked into overdrive.
00:34:53.320,00:35:00.480,that not one… but both of their drivers would be leaving the team at the end of this season.
00:35:16.560,00:35:21.760,"Uh, when were you informed, or was it a decision that was made between you and the team?"
00:35:22.280,00:35:30.640,"Guenther called me a week ago or so, um, to tell me that they were, uh, gonna go for other drivers."
00:35:32.440,00:35:47.000,"Maybe I'm ignorant, but I… I felt pretty confident… You know, Formula 1 can be a cold place, uh… a lot of the time."
00:35:57.360,00:36:04.000,"But I will always, you know, look back and… and be disappointed that I didn't become a world champion."
00:36:04.760,00:36:15.600,"You know, yes, I'm sad about not being able to continue, but I think it's overwhelmingly… You know, I'm more grateful than sad about things, you know."
00:36:22.400,00:36:23.360,It's not good for me.
00:36:23.440,00:36:28.320,"It was, you know, um, collateral damage, if you want, but, uh, you know, nothing I can say."
00:36:28.400,00:36:30.360,"Uh, fair enough. I understand."
00:36:30.440,00:36:32.360,"Uh, and, uh, we move on."
00:36:42.440,00:36:46.440,"it's never a nice thing to do and, for sure, somebody's feelings get hurt."
00:36:51.400,00:36:55.080,"It is not easy, but all good things have, uh, an end."
00:37:59.160,00:38:00.120,Mick Schumacher.
00:38:00.640,00:38:05.360,"Next year, we'll have Mick Schumacher and, uh, Nikita Mazepin as our drivers."
00:38:10.160,00:38:17.040,"in Formula 2 this year and, uh, his father, he has got a very successful company as well, which he may want to promote."
00:38:23.480,00:38:27.760,"was that Mick is going to Alfa because that distracted the real negotiations, you know?"
00:38:32.520,00:38:33.720,Why did you pick Mick?
00:38:33.800,00:38:36.360,"It's going to be tough for a rookie next year, isn't it?"
00:38:38.680,00:38:41.480,I'm sure there will be criticism. Two rookies cannot work.
00:38:41.560,00:38:48.120,"It will be very difficult. I know the challenge in front of us, but because nobody has ever done it, it doesn't mean that it's wrong."
00:02:14.640,00:02:15.840,Shall we go?
00:02:17.480,00:02:18.400,Let's go.
00:02:42.880,00:02:44.760,Mulligan. How bad.
00:02:52.520,00:02:55.480,Carlos has achieved so many things in Formula 1.
00:02:56.080,00:02:58.240,Especially his last year.
00:03:02.000,00:03:03.640,I'm very proud of him.
00:03:09.200,00:03:10.960,"No, I am Jon Rahm."
00:03:11.040,00:03:12.520,Who do you want to be?
00:03:14.400,00:03:40.440,"Today, I am… This part is very tense."
00:03:43.360,00:03:44.680,Come on!
00:03:49.320,00:03:50.360,Good shot.
00:03:50.440,00:03:52.080,-Did it cross over? -Yeah.
00:03:52.840,00:03:57.560,But Formula 1 is a tough business and Carlos has seen some tough times.
00:04:01.880,00:04:03.840,"Ooh, gentlemen!"
00:04:04.560,00:04:07.840,Rickie Fowler has just messed up.
00:04:09.680,00:04:15.880,He needs to make sure he keeps focused and he will not have any problem to find his way to the top.
00:04:16.640,00:04:19.240,You should have been Ian Poulter.
00:05:31.240,00:05:34.960,It's strange also for the team. We discussed it also with Tom already.
00:05:35.040,00:05:42.760,"Obviously knowing that he's leaving at the end of the year, so at some point the normal rules of engagement will come into..."
00:05:42.840,00:05:47.200,into action with not giving him all the information anymore etc..
00:08:32.520,00:08:37.120,"I mean, if I had known it was for a podium, I think I would have made it."
00:09:34.000,00:09:35.560,That's one minute now.
00:09:36.520,00:09:38.760,Keep me posted on the rain intensity.
00:09:39.720,00:09:40.720,"Copy, will do."
00:10:00.920,00:10:04.480,"Carlos, the radar suggests this kind of rain for the whole session."
00:10:04.560,00:10:08.000,Radar suggests rain should be continuous and same intensity as this.
00:10:53.400,00:10:55.760,"Last lap was P4. Good job, Carlos."
00:10:55.840,00:10:58.200,So you'll get three more laps. Three more laps.
00:11:00.600,00:11:02.360,I cannot see a thing.
00:11:13.640,00:11:14.560,I tried.
00:11:19.280,00:11:22.840,"Lando, you're the ninth car out on track, Carlos in front."
00:11:26.880,00:11:28.880,"Yeah, I got traffic from Carlos."
00:11:33.760,00:11:34.880,Watch for Lando.
00:11:35.480,00:11:37.000,What's the rain doing?
00:11:41.440,00:11:43.440,It's definitely more wet now.
00:11:53.640,00:11:55.840,Conditions are getting pretty bad again.
00:11:55.920,00:11:57.920,"Yep, okay. Understood."
00:11:58.400,00:11:59.280,Be careful.
00:12:05.280,00:12:07.640,Can't see anything. Not gonna improve.
00:12:10.520,00:12:14.000,"-I should've done more. -Points come tomorrow, mate."
00:12:16.360,00:12:18.680,-You've got one lap. -Let's keep pushing.
00:12:26.440,00:12:27.920,Keep pushing this lap.
00:12:30.840,00:12:31.680,Copy.
00:12:55.200,00:12:57.640,"Bravo, bravo, bravo!"
00:13:34.240,00:13:37.880,"You're in charge today. So, go get 'em!"
00:15:25.360,00:15:27.680,"Good start, Carlos. P3."
00:15:30.800,00:15:32.440,High-speed section was good.
00:15:32.960,00:15:35.320,I'm happy where I am at the moment.
00:15:35.400,00:15:36.240,Copy.
00:15:47.560,00:15:48.700,My God!
00:15:50.120,00:15:51.360,What the hell?
00:15:52.400,00:15:53.400,"Box, box."
00:15:57.440,00:15:58.920,"Caution, debris."
00:16:00.240,00:16:01.120,Be careful.
00:16:01.720,00:16:02.560,Copy.
00:16:14.200,00:16:16.200,Next car behind is Lando.
00:16:21.480,00:16:23.200,"Gap to Lando, 2.5."
00:16:27.400,00:16:30.800,"Carlos, if he gets to one second, we're gonna consider team orders."
00:16:35.840,00:16:37.720,"Lando, keep close on Carlos."
00:16:39.520,00:16:41.360,"Gap to Carlos, 1.3."
00:16:42.760,00:16:44.680,"Lando, I need you to get closer."
00:16:47.640,00:16:49.320,"Gap to Carlos, one second."
00:16:51.520,00:16:55.400,"-Can I push? We should go racing. -Carlos, we have to let him go."
00:16:59.680,00:17:01.800,"Lando, he'll get out of your way."
00:17:04.840,00:17:07.600,He just turned in on me. What's he trying to do?
00:17:08.720,00:17:11.360,"Lando, just be mindful. Just be mindful."
00:17:14.400,00:17:16.400,"Okay, Carlos, no fight with Lando."
00:17:17.840,00:17:18.920,Team decision.
00:17:37.880,00:17:39.520,"Appreciate it, guys."
00:18:16.480,00:18:17.800,P5.
00:18:23.440,00:18:25.520,What a race. What a race!
00:18:32.320,00:18:33.400,"Yeah, boys!"
00:18:36.400,00:18:39.360,"That is racing, mate. That is racing. Well done."
00:21:16.600,00:21:19.760,A lot of vibration on the car. I don't know why.
00:21:24.320,00:21:25.760,"Whoa, puncture. Puncture."
00:21:27.680,00:21:30.000,-Fuck! -We'll have to box.
00:21:33.400,00:21:35.160,-Good race. -Well done.
00:21:58.760,00:22:00.960,There's some smoke coming out of the car.
00:22:01.480,00:22:03.520,"Yeah. Box, box. Something broke."
00:22:05.040,00:22:06.080,Something big.
00:22:11.480,00:22:13.920,"Carlos, that's dead. You can get out."
00:22:52.800,00:23:03.960,"At the press conference, They always ask me what car I drive."
00:23:04.920,00:23:10.840,"They say, Pagani? Porsche? Ferrari?"
00:23:10.920,00:23:11.960,McLaren?
00:23:12.040,00:23:14.040,"McLaren. And I say, Golf!"
00:23:30.040,00:23:34.320,Come on. Let's get going quick no?
00:23:34.400,00:23:36.160,"-Come on. -It's windy, isn't it?"
00:23:40.320,00:23:44.960,"When he's here, in a way, he's recharging batteries."
00:23:46.200,00:23:47.480,You ready?
00:23:50.400,00:23:54.400,The life of the Formula 1 driver is not easy.
00:23:55.040,00:23:58.120,Motorsport is like that. Motorsport is up and down.
00:23:58.200,00:24:02.680,And to have somebody you know you can trust is super crucial.
00:24:09.560,00:24:10.800,Terrible!
00:24:11.320,00:24:14.920,"When things go wrong, you need to be honest with yourself."
00:24:16.520,00:24:27.560,"Learn from the bad things, and if you need to cry, you cry, but learn, make the mistakes, trust in your talent, trust in your ideas, trust the way you want to do things."
00:24:30.080,00:24:35.440,"You suddenly start to think in a different way on a few things, and then you are changing your approach."
00:24:36.000,00:24:41.040,"You change as a person, you know, and then, suddenly, you make a step in your career."
00:24:42.920,00:24:49.480,"You must try to analyze, and then turn the page, fully committed, fully concentrated in the next race."
00:24:53.560,00:24:55.280,I think it's the right approach.
00:26:07.320,00:26:08.760,Wave at them.
00:29:13.840,00:29:16.680,-You were fastest last lap. -Copy.
00:29:30.000,00:29:30.840,Come on!
00:29:32.360,00:29:33.360,Nice job.
00:29:40.720,00:29:43.800,"Carlos, you can be patient with Räikkönen. You can be patient."
00:30:15.240,00:30:17.040,Brake line exploded.
00:30:58.280,00:31:02.800,"Guys, we could get both cars on the podium, so let's get working together."
00:31:11.480,00:31:12.720,He has a lot of pace.
00:31:12.800,00:31:15.840,The gap is 4.3. This is still on. This is still on.
00:31:15.920,00:31:17.200,"Okay, okay, okay."
00:31:21.560,00:31:23.520,We need to be patient. Come on.
00:31:23.600,00:31:24.840,They will get there.
00:31:29.560,00:31:31.480,"You can do this, mate. Keep your head cool."
00:31:31.920,00:31:33.320,"I want this win, Tom."
00:31:34.080,00:31:35.680,He's fucking fast. Come on.
00:31:36.680,00:31:38.680,Five laps to go. Five laps.
00:31:39.280,00:31:40.640,"Gap, 2.8."
00:31:45.520,00:31:46.680,Gap every lap.
00:31:57.480,00:32:00.520,"Three laps to go, Carlos. Maximum focus now."
00:32:00.600,00:32:01.960,-No mistakes. -Copy.
00:33:02.760,00:33:03.720,"P2, buddy."
00:33:04.440,00:33:06.200,"Great work, mate. Great work."
00:33:13.960,00:33:16.400,"Thank you, guys. We tried our best, I think."
00:33:16.480,00:33:18.440,Thank you. Amazing weekend.
00:34:56.000,00:34:56.880,It's bad luck.
00:35:06.800,00:35:09.120,-Who is it? -Has he got out?
00:00:06.040,00:00:08.920,All right. I'll call Carlos. One sec. I'm calling Carlos.
00:00:16.240,00:00:18.800,"Um, you are speaking… You don't know?"
00:00:34.480,00:00:37.520,with lots of banter in your relationship as teammates.
00:00:37.600,00:00:41.040,We kinda went into the first time meeting and that was how it all started.
00:00:43.600,00:00:47.200,"-Been doing well, this cabrón, lately. -This cabrón! This cabrón!"
00:00:47.280,00:00:49.560,So we're gonna spend some more... some more time together.
00:00:53.920,00:00:57.160,"obviously, learning from a guy with, with such experience."
00:00:59.000,00:01:00.120,Guacamole.
00:01:01.360,00:01:02.400,No. Moley. No.
00:01:11.080,00:01:11.920,Ooh!
00:01:21.680,00:01:30.920,"In a surprise move, Carlos Sainz has decided to leave his Formula 1 family, McLaren, at the end of the year to join Ferrari for the 2021 season."
00:01:33.960,00:01:36.120,is happening in the early part of the season.
00:01:37.280,00:01:46.080,"Carlos has got to go through the entire season with his team and Lando knowing that, at the end of the year, they're gonna part ways."
00:02:32.920,00:02:37.920,"It's probably been my strongest year in F1, so it makes me feel proud and happy."
00:03:16.720,00:03:17.640,Rickie Fowler.
00:03:24.480,00:03:30.440,but I think being a Ferrari driver is one of the most special things in Formula 1.
00:03:31.440,00:03:34.120,It's on the checklist of pretty much every driver.
00:03:34.640,00:03:36.520,I've got the opportunity to do it.
00:04:30.360,00:04:32.720,Carlos got the opportunity to go to Ferrari.
00:04:33.720,00:04:37.240,"But this is a business, so we'll have to get on with it."
00:04:41.280,00:04:43.240,it's sad to see Carlos going.
00:04:43.320,00:04:49.800,"But the media, definitely, um, I think the Seb news was the thing that took them by surprise."
00:04:50.960,00:04:58.280,"How Seb divorced Ferrari, that's not very pretty. I think-- Carlos has been doing… We did agree, Let's get a few interviews done."
00:04:58.360,00:05:02.040,"We know people are asking about Ferrari, but let's get interviews out of the way."
00:05:02.120,00:05:09.960,"So, by the time we get to Austria, that story's now covered, we can get back to racing and he can talk about the rest of the year with us, which is what he wants."
00:05:14.360,00:05:21.320,"How is this working relationship even going to continue, with McLaren knowing that Sainz is going to Ferrari?"
00:05:23.360,00:05:25.960,"-Hey, Mr. Brown. What's happening? -How are you?"
00:05:26.040,00:05:28.800,-Good to see you. Yeah. All good. -Good.
00:05:28.880,00:05:31.160,"I, uh, I talked to Carlos earlier."
00:05:51.560,00:05:59.400,you don't want them to take all of the knowledge that you are going to try and use to beat that team with in the future.
00:05:59.480,00:06:09.360,"So, yeah, it's... it's only normal that a racing driver starts to get marginalized in his own team when it's already known that he's off to a rival."
00:06:22.320,00:06:25.400,Styria is a wonderful place to be.
00:06:25.480,00:06:28.640,"And, for the first time, we have the Styrian Grand Prix."
00:06:35.240,00:06:38.840,I can't see this drying out in the near future.
00:06:45.080,00:06:46.160,"Yeah, good."
00:06:51.480,00:06:53.640,We're gonna give it a go. We did it last time.
00:07:01.680,00:07:10.440,"Lando came out of the gates, uh, very strong and he had an, uh, awesome first race, and I'm... I'm very proud."
00:07:10.520,00:07:11.360,See ya.
00:07:15.520,00:07:19.200,"Everything that we said, Here's what 2020 needs to look like."
00:07:24.240,00:07:30.920,"I've had a very good start to 2020, scoring my first podium in Formula 1 in the first race of the season."
00:07:34.840,00:07:36.600,It was a dream start.
00:07:36.680,00:07:39.040,"Something I never dreamt of, kind of thing."
00:07:45.160,00:07:48.320,"caught everybody by surprise, especially Carlos."
00:07:53.680,00:07:54.840,led by Zak Brown.
00:07:55.480,00:07:58.000,I think Lando lies at the heart of it.
00:08:00.960,00:08:03.360,It's almost like a father-son relationship.
00:08:04.640,00:08:08.480,Lando sits at the very center of everything Zak wants McLaren to be.
00:08:12.800,00:08:16.840,but it's now within the bounds of the drivers to be able to go out.
00:08:20.360,00:08:23.800,He managed to finish third and I finished P5.
00:08:24.840,00:08:31.720,"It actually was very close, because I was coming from behind and I had a chance to overtake him and didn't quite make it stick."
00:08:38.640,00:08:42.560,"Myself and Carlos, we've always had a, a good friendship."
00:08:43.440,00:08:46.560,"But last year, I was a rookie. There was a lot of slack."
00:08:46.640,00:08:53.520,"Whereas this year, I'm pushing him more, and I guess that's never something that you wanna see your teammate do."
00:09:00.760,00:09:06.280,"This year, Lando's a much more confident racer than he was."
00:09:13.520,00:09:16.200,tells me that I am prepared to lead this team.
00:09:18.520,00:09:19.800,I want to be on top.
00:10:10.560,00:10:15.160,you know the whole thing is gonna go chaotic and it's gonna be a good show.
00:10:31.240,00:10:32.480,Whoa!
00:10:39.160,00:10:41.280,Carlos is extremely good in the wet.
00:10:44.080,00:10:47.640,"How smooth he is with the hands, how he goes on the throttle."
00:11:08.040,00:11:09.800,at this circuit last year.
00:12:44.640,00:12:50.280,Carlos Sainz will start third on the grid for McLaren in a brilliant qualifying performance from the Spaniard.
00:13:06.160,00:13:11.200,"It takes big cojones to do a lap like that in the wet, definitely. Definitely."
00:13:19.840,00:13:21.560,echoing around the hills here.
00:13:46.480,00:13:49.640,to take at least one pole in 14 consecutive seasons.
00:13:49.720,00:13:57.560,"He starts on pole position, and alongside him, Max Verstappen, who's on the front row, second on the grid, for the third consecutive race."
00:13:57.640,00:14:02.280,"Behind these two, on row two, Carlos Sainz of McLaren, third on the grid for the second..."
00:14:03.640,00:14:06.440,"Renault, McLaren, Racing Point, fighting for positions."
00:14:06.520,00:14:07.960,We look forward to this one.
00:14:17.800,00:14:20.880,and they both want to beat each other so badly.
00:14:23.320,00:14:27.760,You can see the desire to beat each other has gone up some.
00:14:28.280,00:14:32.160,"So it's a very, very healthy, uh, rivalry."
00:14:32.240,00:14:34.640,But you never wanna favor drivers.
00:14:44.600,00:14:47.960,when the fight between them is as close as it is.
00:15:03.560,00:15:05.040,I think it's game on.
00:15:43.400,00:15:45.960,"Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc, make contact!"
00:16:07.760,00:16:09.440,Carlos Sainz in third place.
00:17:25.080,00:17:26.000,Fucking hell.
00:17:33.320,00:17:36.800,it's only because we think that's the faster car.
00:17:40.800,00:17:51.200,"Instead of it being me having to let him go and sacrifice my race in some ways, uh, it's been the opposite way around, and I've been the one in the, the prime position."
00:18:46.400,00:18:48.800,He had to give up his position to Lando Norris.
00:18:48.880,00:18:52.200,"Ferrari are lagging, to say the least."
00:18:52.280,00:18:57.280,"He's obviously gonna move to the Scuderia. Can't back out now, can you?"
00:19:05.000,00:19:10.720,"I don't really show a lot of anger and rage, mainly because I'm not that kind of character."
00:19:10.800,00:19:16.240,"At some point, I always end up, I don't know, throwing a glove or just a small gesture."
00:19:16.320,00:19:19.360,"If I do some kind of that, it shows that I'm really, really angry."
00:19:19.440,00:19:21.200,"I just, I'm just taking it inside."
00:19:41.000,00:19:42.800,Let me see. Can I take care of it?
00:19:48.720,00:19:56.560,"In some ways, it's already kinda started, the little bit of a tail-off, um, with him obviously going to Ferrari next year."
00:19:56.640,00:19:58.840,"Carlos, one. Lando, zero."
00:19:59.880,00:20:17.840,"Thing is I'm gonna do something to him, and he's gonna get real-- and that's very rare in Formula 1."
00:20:18.680,00:20:20.320,This year is very different.
00:20:20.400,00:20:21.960,Have you guys missed each other?
00:20:23.360,00:20:25.640,"Yeah, the gloves are off between those two."
00:20:38.400,00:20:40.800,"And it's lights out, and away we go."
00:21:39.320,00:21:42.880,I'm starting to get frustrated because nothing seems to go right for me at the moment.
00:22:21.120,00:22:29.720,"where you're not even able to compete or to start a race, um… They weren't held for long. Hamilton, away well."
00:22:29.800,00:22:31.320,…it's the biggest disappointment.
00:22:38.200,00:22:41.360,I've lost 30 or more points this year.
00:22:54.760,00:22:56.160,they always ask...
00:23:22.200,00:23:23.360,their own time.
00:23:24.600,00:23:27.160,My family has always been next to me.
00:23:27.240,00:23:29.400,It's where I feel the most comfortable.
00:24:02.760,00:24:03.840,Okay.
00:25:02.600,00:25:05.280,and here we are at Monza.
00:25:07.160,00:25:10.920,"This is the temple of speed, and the home of Ferrari."
00:25:27.200,00:25:33.040,"with thousands of Ferrari's passionate fans, or Tifosi, as they're affectionately called."
00:25:34.200,00:25:38.520,"This year, mostly watching from the safety of their own homes."
00:25:44.800,00:25:49.440,"You can see, there was evidence of a lot of them standing there trying to get a glimpse of their heroes."
00:25:49.520,00:25:50.360,"Hey, guys."
00:26:05.080,00:26:07.240,"Ooh, Tifosi!"
00:26:14.520,00:26:17.120,It's nearly like a religion here in Italy.
00:26:18.040,00:26:21.400,We're gonna have a lot of time and a lot of opportunities.
00:26:31.920,00:26:34.440,"If they're not winning, there's pressure."
00:26:49.760,00:26:58.000,"I think, if you have any affiliation with Ferrari, whether you're a current driver or going to be there, there's probably, uh, an increased intensity to it."
00:27:02.440,00:27:06.760,"He's soon gonna be a Ferrari driver, so that puts a big spotlight on you."
00:27:07.520,00:27:18.320,"But, uh, for sure, Lando's performance this year, and, uh, Carlos's bad luck along the way, won't be, uh, putting him in the happiest of moods at all times."
00:27:31.840,00:27:33.960,compared to our fastest from turn one.
00:27:34.040,00:27:38.440,You can see he's challenging the fronts just as much in this phase.
00:27:39.360,00:27:42.520,But his style is that he won't extend holding the brake here.
00:27:44.680,00:27:48.840,Because he always just programs himself to come off the brakes the same each corner.
00:27:48.920,00:27:52.320,It's just the subtle difference in that he's got the tow here.
00:27:52.400,00:27:53.840,You've not quite got it.
00:27:58.440,00:28:02.640,We're not asking you to adopt Lando's approach to the braking.
00:28:02.720,00:28:05.120,-It's how we optimize your approach. -Yeah.
00:28:06.080,00:28:11.320,"I think any time things don't go your way for a driver, you get disappointed."
00:28:11.400,00:28:15.800,"It's a… It's a very emotional, passionate, uh, sport."
00:28:15.880,00:28:19.040,There's times the drivers make some mistakes.
00:28:23.200,00:28:24.560,to have the right attitude.
00:28:24.640,00:28:30.120,"Without hard work, dedication, it's pretty much impossible to get to where you want."
00:28:35.560,00:28:40.960,He knows the Tifosi will welcome him with open arms if he can have a great race in Italy.
00:28:43.400,00:28:46.040,you know you are gonna be part of their family next year.
00:28:46.520,00:28:48.400,That feeling is difficult to explain.
00:28:48.480,00:28:51.520,And it's part of why I'm so excited about going to Ferrari.
00:28:59.400,00:29:09.040,"So there's only two things then that you can control, which is your fitness, but also be as mentally well-prepared and self-confident as you can."
00:29:20.960,00:29:23.200,How quickly can he get through the pack?
00:29:36.560,00:29:37.680,or even the win.
00:29:51.360,00:29:55.160,"who gives him enough space, and Sainz moves up into second place!"
00:29:56.000,00:30:00.360,This is a very strong position for McLaren as it stands at the moment.
00:30:00.440,00:30:05.640,"Sebastian Vettel down in 17th, and under pressure from George Russell."
00:30:22.280,00:30:25.040,What a dismal season poor old Seb is having.
00:30:31.160,00:30:33.720,And that is a very big accident.
00:30:38.200,00:30:41.640,"What a horrible, horrible Italian Grand Prix for the Scuderia."
00:31:05.600,00:31:06.880,to go and join Ferrari.
00:31:06.960,00:31:10.360,How he would love to go to the Scuderia as a race winner.
00:32:29.320,00:32:31.960,And look at that! Sliding through the Ascari chicane.
00:32:32.040,00:32:36.880,"It's like watching his father doing rallying, but we're watching Carlos Sainz in Formula 1."
00:32:36.960,00:32:39.000,He's given it absolutely everything.
00:32:55.880,00:32:57.600,and what a great fight he gave.
00:33:23.320,00:33:29.760,"I'm actually very, very happy, and… Um, yeah, particularly proud of what I have achieved."
00:33:32.920,00:33:37.560,I think there is a part of Carlos that probably would love to stay at McLaren.
00:33:49.720,00:33:55.760,"Now, you would say, in some of the races, they've been seventh-best team."
00:33:55.840,00:33:59.600,And you would say it's one of the worst decisions you could possibly make.
00:33:59.680,00:34:01.280,He probably is regretting it.
00:34:01.360,00:34:04.160,"Um, even if he says he's not, he probably is."
00:34:13.400,00:34:17.200,and that is a feeling that no one's gonna be able to take away from me.
00:34:17.280,00:34:21.120,"Going to Ferrari, it's something that… It's impossible to regret."
00:34:30.120,00:34:33.080,"Say it. Yes, you're gonna miss me. Say it now."
00:34:33.160,00:34:35.080,-You can't force me to say it. -Yeah. Say it.
00:34:35.160,00:34:38.080,"When I'm passing him on the racetrack, I can wave at him."
00:34:43.200,00:34:44.680,-Everyone is booked? -Yeah.
00:34:47.440,00:34:48.800,uncertain of their futures.
00:01:06.600,00:01:10.920,"Formula 1, it's been my life for many years."
00:01:13.120,00:01:14.560,But it's not over.
00:01:20.200,00:01:23.320,"After ten years in the sport, I don't want to have any regrets."
00:01:25.600,00:01:33.000,"I believe, if I can do well, I have a chance to be in Formula 1 next year."
00:01:35.960,00:01:38.000,Twenty seconds. Twenty seconds.
00:01:43.760,00:01:46.120,Ten seconds. Ten seconds.
00:01:46.880,00:01:48.280,Maybe we're not finished.
00:01:54.800,00:01:56.200,Anything can happen.
00:02:22.000,00:02:22.920,Fuck.
00:02:28.800,00:02:31.440,Red flag. There's a big incident. Red flag.
00:02:34.880,00:02:37.040,"Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!"
00:02:37.120,00:02:39.480,This… this was a big one. This was a big one.
00:02:42.720,00:02:44.440,Who is it? Has he got out?
00:02:45.160,00:02:46.920,No information on it yet.
00:03:19.840,00:03:22.680,"- I'm so pissed off. - Yeah, it's fucked up."
00:03:28.680,00:03:31.400,"Romain, talk to us about the future, if you would."
00:03:31.480,00:03:36.920,It's bloody difficult to find a seat for 2021 when you are let go that late in 2020.
00:03:37.000,00:03:38.120,It's gonna be tough.
00:04:08.720,00:04:12.080,I'm gonna say F-U-C-K you.
00:04:33.400,00:04:36.640,I've put a lot of effort and passion into the team.
00:04:36.720,00:04:38.320,I always pushed for us to do better.
00:04:40.880,00:04:43.560,"Just call him in. End this fucking pain, you know?"
00:04:44.560,00:04:45.800,Fucking hell.
00:04:45.880,00:04:47.960,"There's a lot I can accept, but not this."
00:04:48.040,00:04:54.800,"So, to be let go at the end of the year, it hurt me a little bit."
00:04:57.200,00:05:01.640,"But right now, it's relax, breathe and cool down and focus again."
00:05:12.360,00:05:18.920,"After ten years in the sport, retirement, it's a conversation I had with my wife, my family and my kids."
00:05:19.000,00:05:27.640,"They know the risk of Formula 1, but I told them if there is an opportunity to carry on, I'm gonna jump on it."
00:06:20.800,00:06:23.200,No news. I can't find a team.
00:06:31.760,00:06:35.080,"Now, at least, the news is out and we can get on with it."
00:06:47.080,00:06:54.000,"No. All the feedback I was getting was that we all wanted to continue, so, uh, there was nothing to prepare me, really."
00:06:54.080,00:07:03.880,At no point I felt my seat was at a real risk because the feedback that I got from Otmar… I don't like to talk about contractual stuff.
00:07:32.840,00:07:38.280,"Obviously, the season is coming to an end soon, so very soon, I will know what the future holds for me."
00:07:43.040,00:07:44.000,Poor kid.
00:07:44.640,00:07:45.920,Feel sorry for him.
00:07:54.720,00:07:57.400,It's a crazy world. You haven't got a team.
00:07:58.040,00:08:00.600,You know that there are not many vacancies.
00:08:19.480,00:08:23.640,I think this is a situation that's out of my hands.
00:08:24.360,00:08:25.440,Let's see.
00:08:26.720,00:08:28.160,Let me put this over your head.
00:08:30.080,00:08:32.320,I want to carry on. I don't know anything else.
00:08:32.400,00:08:34.880,I've never done anything else.
00:08:34.960,00:08:35.960,Yeah.
00:08:37.160,00:08:38.160,Last one.
00:08:39.040,00:08:40.160,Relax.
00:08:40.680,00:08:41.600,Hold it.
00:08:44.240,00:08:45.520,Get up.
00:09:27.320,00:09:30.320,Gap ahead to Hamilton 8 seconds. That's a good gap.
00:09:30.920,00:09:32.160,Okay.
00:09:36.360,00:09:39.320,Press oil pump button. Press oil pump button.
00:09:45.360,00:09:47.360,"Keep pushing, Checo. One more lap."
00:09:47.440,00:09:48.680,Keep pushing.
00:09:54.040,00:09:56.720,"- How is the pace? - Very good, Checo."
00:10:05.600,00:10:07.560,What do you think about the tires so far?
00:10:07.640,00:10:10.120,They just lose so much front grip on the second push.
00:10:37.040,00:10:38.000,"Sorry, guys."
00:11:23.440,00:11:27.400,Should've pulled out of it. I was a bit surprised by the lack of grip.
00:11:52.160,00:11:54.480,…I think they're a step too far.
00:12:48.440,00:12:50.400,"In Formula 1, you always think about your future."
00:12:52.400,00:12:53.720,I want to do the maximum.
00:12:53.800,00:12:57.320,You don't want to be driving too cautiously.
00:12:57.400,00:13:00.000,I'm just gonna go and drive the way I like it.
00:13:19.560,00:13:24.640,I'm actually approaching the last three races as my final races in Formula 1 because I don't know what will happen.
00:13:25.760,00:13:29.720,"In life, you get certain opportunities. You just have to maximize all of them."
00:13:31.120,00:13:33.280,"Whatever comes, I'm just ready for it."
00:13:33.360,00:13:35.440,Twenty seconds. Twenty seconds.
00:13:45.560,00:13:48.640,"When you arrive at the back of the grid, one static bite point."
00:13:48.720,00:13:49.600,Okay.
00:13:51.000,00:13:53.120,"Radio check now, Checo, radio check."
00:13:53.200,00:13:54.120,Copy.
00:14:11.320,00:14:13.320,"Tires are good, Checo. Just wanna keep this."
00:14:13.400,00:14:14.600,Let's focus now.
00:15:31.640,00:15:35.000,Red flag. Red flag. There's a big incident. Red flag.
00:15:35.800,00:15:37.480,"- Copy. - Slow down, please."
00:15:37.560,00:15:39.880,"Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!"
00:15:39.960,00:15:42.400,This… this was a big one. This was a big one.
00:15:51.160,00:15:52.360,Is he okay?
00:15:52.440,00:15:53.800,I will come back to you.
00:15:53.880,00:15:55.560,"No, please."
00:15:55.640,00:15:57.160,"Ah, fuck."
00:15:57.760,00:15:58.720,Has he got out?
00:15:59.680,00:16:01.680,No information on it yet.
00:16:02.280,00:16:04.920,Shit. Is he… Is he okay?
00:16:06.080,00:16:07.600,Come into the pit lane.
00:16:08.680,00:16:11.400,"Oh, tell me he's okay. Please tell me he's okay."
00:16:44.000,00:16:47.160,You cannot do anything. You're just a passenger to this.
00:16:47.680,00:16:50.120,The world seems to be coming down on you.
00:16:55.160,00:16:58.240,"Once you see fire, that's the worst thing you can have."
00:16:58.320,00:16:59.360,This is bad.
00:17:21.240,00:17:22.880,Everything goes through your head.
00:17:23.400,00:17:26.520,You don't think that anybody can get out alive of this one.
00:17:32.240,00:17:35.280,I've been doing racing long enough. There is no good outcome.
00:17:35.920,00:17:36.920,He's not coming out.
00:18:12.280,00:18:16.320,Only when you see those things do you believe the danger that we go into.
00:23:09.600,00:23:12.480,"So, unfortunately, Lance is out, but he is okay."
00:23:13.000,00:23:16.440,"Checo, we need maximum pace now, please. Maximum pace. Stay positive."
00:23:23.120,00:23:25.480,"Checo, the car behind is now Albon."
00:23:27.640,00:23:29.560,DRS is enabled. DRS is enabled.
00:23:38.920,00:23:40.320,What's the gap?
00:23:43.000,00:23:44.600,Two tenths quicker than Albon.
00:23:45.200,00:23:47.360,"Okay, Alex, Pérez ahead. Let's have him."
00:23:47.440,00:23:48.720,"Yeah, I'm trying."
00:24:05.960,00:24:08.320,"Last two laps, two tenths quicker than Albon."
00:24:10.120,00:24:12.480,Your lap time is getting closer to Verstappen's.
00:24:24.440,00:24:26.600,I'm losing power. Losing power.
00:24:27.960,00:24:30.360,I cannot continue this pace for the other laps.
00:24:32.120,00:24:33.160,Not coming back.
00:24:45.000,00:24:46.600,Be careful in braking zones.
00:24:46.680,00:24:48.960,"There's obviously a lot of oil coming out, now he's on fire."
00:24:52.880,00:24:54.920,"Checo, stop the car, please, stop the car."
00:24:55.000,00:24:56.080,It's on fire.
00:25:02.760,00:25:06.160,"- Okay, we should be good now. - Nice job. Keep pushing."
00:25:35.320,00:25:38.280,"- All right, nice job, P3. - Yeah, thank you, guys."
00:25:47.280,00:25:48.400,"Thanks, Christian."
00:26:48.520,a,"0 00:26:48.520 00:26:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% sad day for everyonesterday was a sad day for everyone."
00:26:52.320,00:26:53.960,I've had a lot of bad luck.
00:26:56.560,00:27:01.880,The important thing yesterday was that Grosjean walked away from that accident with his life.
00:27:03.760,00:27:06.280,It's been an emotional roller coaster.
00:27:07.840,00:27:09.480,This is strong.
00:27:09.560,00:27:11.880,- This is water. - Mexican water!
00:27:14.320,00:27:17.520,The podium was in the bag and got away from us.
00:27:17.600,00:27:18.480,Yes.
00:27:34.800,00:27:36.960,This game is called Black Widow.
00:27:43.720,00:27:47.560,You don't have to have the best game. Just make sure that you don't lose.
00:27:48.280,00:27:50.960,"And now, it looks like I'm leaving at the end of the year."
00:27:54.560,00:27:56.440,"It makes me feel very, very sad."
00:28:21.520,00:28:23.720,"Of course, I will fight for the championship."
00:29:48.600,00:29:51.320,"-I'm so fucking happy to see you. - Thank you, my friend."
00:29:55.520,00:29:56.800,-Steiner. - How are you?
00:29:56.880,00:29:57.800,Yeah.
00:29:58.560,00:30:00.480,The knee is getting really good.
00:30:01.000,00:30:02.360,Ankle also.
00:30:06.320,00:30:08.120,They're talking about a graft.
00:30:09.120,00:30:09.960,Yeah.
00:30:10.040,00:30:12.960,"So I say, Everyone who's gonna shake my hand's gonna shake my arse!"
00:30:14.080,00:30:19.240,"But you can laugh at least! I can still hear the… …coming up, yeah."
00:30:19.320,00:30:22.360,"You see it in movies and think it's not true, it's true."
00:30:22.440,00:30:24.680,The hit with the wall wasn't hard.
00:30:25.200,00:30:31.520,"Uh, it… it's strange because it was 56 Gs you know, so it means my body was about 3.9 tonnes."
00:30:34.800,00:30:37.920,And then I remember opening my eyes when everything stopped.
00:30:41.400,00:30:51.480,"And I tried to lift myself and jump out of the car and I… I feel that I hit something on top of my helmet so I sit back down and I thought, Well, I'm upside down, against the wall or whatever."
00:30:51.560,00:30:53.880,Someone will come and rescue me. I'll just wait.
00:30:57.440,00:31:01.120,"Then I look a bit right and a bit left, and then it's all orange on the left."
00:31:01.720,00:31:05.680,"Uh, why is it orange? It's not sunset. Is it the light from the circuit? No."
00:31:06.280,00:31:07.440,"Oh, it's fire."
00:31:11.080,00:31:14.360,"I tried to go up, didn't work. Right didn't work. Left didn't work."
00:31:14.440,00:31:17.840,"Sit down, try to understand. Go left, it was twitching a bit, the head."
00:31:17.920,00:31:20.000,"Okay, it works, but my foot is stuck."
00:31:29.240,00:31:32.120,I started asking myself very simple questions.
00:31:32.760,00:31:35.880,Where am I going to burn first? Is it going to be painful?
00:31:37.400,00:31:44.440,"Few people have known that moment, uh, where… you almost accept that you're dead."
00:31:45.720,00:31:46.880,"Fucking hell, yeah."
00:31:48.320,00:31:49.400,How are the kids?
00:31:49.480,00:31:51.240,They ask many questions.
00:31:51.840,00:31:54.200,Then the kids… kids came in the car.
00:31:54.720,00:31:56.920,"They said No, Daddy, this is not happening."
00:32:00.360,00:32:02.640,It cannot be… It cannot be the end.
00:32:03.240,00:32:06.400,"It was like boom-boom-boom-boom, survival instinct."
00:32:06.920,00:32:10.000,I put my hands in the fire and I can feel my hands are burning.
00:32:10.080,00:32:15.960,I can see the gloves that are red normally become completely black and… and I can feel the pain.
00:32:18.000,00:32:20.720,"But at that time, I don't… I don't care, you know?"
00:32:22.640,00:32:29.600,"And when the shoulders are going through, the doctor pulls on my overall and… and this is the time I realized I was alive."
00:32:30.360,00:32:31.560,I was going to live.
00:32:33.240,00:32:36.200,"And that feeling, I think, will stay in my head forever."
00:32:46.440,00:32:48.280,I still can't believe it.
00:32:48.360,00:32:54.360,From the moment of the crash till the moment that we saw on the TV that he was alive.
00:32:54.440,00:32:55.920,Two minutes 45.
00:33:04.040,00:33:06.840,"I mean, I… Words still fail me."
00:33:09.320,00:33:17.600,"And the longer it was lasting, the more I started to believe that he… he was dead."
00:33:18.480,00:33:29.800,"And, um… Even a few days after that, our oldest son, Sacha, he said, Oh, I was scared that he would be burned everywhere."
00:33:48.880,00:33:59.520,"I'm still a racer and I'll still miss racing this weekend, but, uh… the priorities that were here last week are, you know, very different."
00:34:00.120,00:34:01.920,It changed my life forever.
00:34:05.720,00:34:07.720,"F1 is a job, it's a passion."
00:34:09.760,00:34:16.880,"Put my parents, my wife, my kids, my friends through that stress again if I have a big crash?"
00:34:17.560,00:34:18.920,I… I don't think I can.
00:34:20.040,00:34:23.040,"For two minutes 43 seconds, for them, I was dead."
00:34:32.520,00:34:39.840,"So yes, I'm sad about leaving Formula 1, but… yeah, there is no… you know, there's no regret."
00:34:42.000,00:34:45.120,"I think now, it's just… life will be much more beautiful."
00:34:45.200,00:34:56.160,"I mean, when you go through that and you have a second birthday, a second chance in life, a chance of life, yeah, you… you just take it."
00:35:05.840,00:35:11.480,"I… I didn't win a race, I didn't win the championship, but I will have a legacy forever in Formula 1."
00:35:12.920,00:35:15.680,"You know, I… I'm the man that walked out of fire."
00:35:37.880,00:35:39.720,Relax. Relax.
00:35:42.880,00:35:47.480,- Go to the door. - Go on.
00:35:51.440,00:35:53.200,Ten seconds.
00:35:58.200,00:35:59.720,"Push it, come on."
00:35:59.800,00:36:02.400,- I know how good I am. - Good.
00:36:04.200,00:36:05.480,Five fast reps.
00:38:04.080,00:38:05.880,"Keep going, Checo, keep going."
00:38:27.080,00:38:29.480,Ugh! I think I had bad… bad luck happen.
00:38:47.560,00:38:49.720,Let's focus. Sorry. Let's focus now.
00:38:51.760,00:38:53.640,"Okay, let's get the maximum today."
00:39:04.960,00:39:07.080,Fittipaldi ahead on soft.
00:39:11.480,00:39:13.040,How is the pace right now?
00:39:13.120,00:39:15.080,"That is good pace, Checo, good pace."
00:39:18.800,00:39:21.200,You're in a good position. There's a long race ahead.
00:39:21.280,00:39:23.320,"Next car ahead, Magnussen, also soft."
00:39:33.520,00:39:35.680,"Good, Checo, so next car is Vettel."
00:39:55.640,00:39:58.000,"- Next car ahead, Albon. - Copy."
00:39:58.080,00:40:01.240,"- Checo, this pace is very good. - We need the points."
00:40:10.840,00:40:13.680,This is a key phase. Push. Keep the pressure on him.
00:40:14.440,00:40:16.560,Next car behind you is now Pérez.
00:40:17.120,00:40:18.720,Let's push now to pull away.
00:40:56.520,00:40:58.640,- Go on! - Fucking hell!
00:41:00.920,00:41:01.880,Yes!
00:41:01.960,00:41:03.400,"That was close, guys."
00:41:03.480,00:41:05.360,"He needs a drive, pal."
00:41:13.480,00:41:15.600,"Checo, your pace is seriously strong."
00:41:15.680,00:41:17.080,Albon behind is dying.
00:41:46.480,00:41:48.920,Just keep your head down and try and get Ocon.
00:42:38.760,00:42:40.880,There's been a big problem for Bottas ahead.
00:42:54.120,00:42:57.960,"Okay, George, we need to box. We have a mixed tire set on the car."
00:43:14.080,00:43:16.760,We are now the lead car. Russell has also boxed.
00:43:26.600,00:43:27.960,I can hardly speak.
00:43:28.560,00:43:31.160,"Yes, Checo, this is really good. Maximum push."
00:44:05.760,00:44:06.800,"Yes, Checo!"
00:44:14.880,00:44:16.520,"Yes, Checo, P1!"
00:44:17.520,00:44:18.440,Yes!
00:44:26.000,00:44:27.120,"I'm speechless, guys."
00:44:28.560,00:44:30.200,"Amazing, Checo, well done."
00:45:44.640,00:45:46.600,"No. I'm really, really happy."
00:45:46.680,00:45:48.040,"I mean, look at Sergio."
00:45:48.120,00:45:51.680,"What a great drive, from last to first. Not many people can say that."
00:46:50.400,00:46:51.840,There's Daddy.
00:46:53.360,00:46:55.520,He saw the entire race.
00:46:55.600,00:47:00.520,"He was just screaming, Dad! Dad! Dad!"
00:47:01.360,00:47:04.080,"We were all crying, darling."
00:47:04.160,00:47:05.440,"No, no, no."
00:47:05.520,00:47:07.120,"I love you all, family."
00:47:39.560,00:47:41.120,"I needed this, man."
00:47:41.200,00:47:42.800,"What's up, man? Good job."
00:47:43.320,00:47:45.720,"-You're a badass, man. - We're all badasses."
00:49:01.160,00:49:04.240,- Let's fuck some shit up. - Everything we got.
00:00:15.440,00:00:21.800,Once when you lose your career and then once at the actual end.
00:00:56.480,00:00:57.480,Don't know.
00:00:58.080,00:01:01.720,I know what I need to do. I want that seat more than anyone.
00:01:01.800,00:01:05.560,Just a couple of last-minute reminders. The wind has picked up a bit.
00:01:16.800,00:01:19.000,Easy to overtake. High tire degradation.
00:02:10.520,00:02:14.400,and Pérez coming up on the inside of Verstappen who is now in second place.
00:02:14.480,00:02:16.040,And there's Alex Albon.
00:02:16.160,00:02:19.720,He's wheel to wheel with Valtteri Bottas as they file their way through.
00:03:13.160,00:03:19.760,"Just this morning, the Haas F1 team announced that both of their drivers would be leaving the team at the end of the season."
00:03:26.440,00:03:28.600,"I mean, they were very professional about it."
00:03:42.240,00:03:47.000,"Letting people go is never easy, but, uh, all good things have, uh, an end."
00:04:01.960,00:04:04.720,"12:19 arrival, allegedly, mate. Let's see what you can do."
00:04:05.600,00:04:07.000,I'm gonna say 12:24.
00:04:17.000,00:04:19.000,for Kevin Magnussen and Romain Grosjean.
00:04:19.800,00:04:22.080,It's potentially the end of F1 for Grosjean.
00:05:08.240,00:05:09.640,Here he goes.
00:05:31.960,00:05:33.320,Stopping is not an option.
00:05:39.760,00:05:48.320,"who've spent their entire lives trying to be in Formula 1, leaving that is almost like stepping away from an addiction."
00:05:48.400,00:05:49.560,There we go.
00:05:53.080,00:06:00.160,"He doesn't want to leave Formula 1, but he's left without a race seat in 2021."
00:06:01.280,00:06:04.120,"And right now, he's not the only one."
00:06:12.720,00:06:20.720,"The first of its kind, a double-header in Bahrain as two races are held here back-to-back over two weekends."
00:06:26.520,00:06:31.680,and especially for numerous drivers who come here uncertain of their futures.
00:06:39.080,00:06:42.200,"Uh, big news, uh, regarding you, obviously."
00:06:42.280,00:06:47.000,"From what the team said, was there anything to prepare you for what we now know is going to happen?"
00:06:54.080,00:07:10.640,"At no point I felt my seat was at a real risk because the feedback that I got from Otmar… …was that they wanted to continue with me, and then very late, we found out that that wasn't the case."
00:07:11.200,00:07:12.840,I was extremely disappointed.
00:07:13.440,00:07:16.080,It could have been handled a bit better.
00:07:17.560,00:07:20.000,Four-time world champion on the team. You must be thrilled.
00:07:22.960,00:07:24.800,It was not an easy decision.
00:07:24.880,00:07:30.960,"Checo's done a great job for us, but when Seb became available, we thought it was, uh, a good match."
00:07:31.040,00:07:32.760,How are you gonna approach things?
00:07:49.160,00:07:53.600,because I felt the decision had nothing to do with performance.
00:08:03.960,00:08:09.080,"In what could be his best ever season in Formula 1, he's left potentially with nothing."
00:08:50.960,00:08:57.200,"I hope now, you know, the team can see that I've maximized my opportunities with the car that I've been given."
00:08:59.560,00:09:01.360,"What comes next, I don't know."
00:09:02.800,00:09:04.040,Anything could happen.
00:09:11.280,00:09:17.400,"The sun is set, so conditions are as they will be for the race, and this is the session that really counts."
00:09:17.480,00:09:22.320,It's the one that you can get all of the data and information to prepare for the race.
00:09:23.680,00:09:26.280,This is Grosjean's first practice lap in the Haas.
00:09:51.720,00:09:53.960,Out onto the start-finish straight.
00:10:11.280,00:10:14.760,another driver who may be wondering where he will be next year.
00:10:14.840,00:10:18.960,His performances in the Red Bull have repeatedly come under the microscope.
00:10:34.080,00:10:35.400,Fucking brutal.
00:10:41.080,00:10:43.200,when he's already under pressure for his seat.
00:10:48.600,00:10:52.920,"To get that ready for qualifying tomorrow, that will be an all-nighter."
00:10:56.000,00:11:03.560,"I can't remember him qualifying fourth, fifth, getting a decent start, just a smooth weekend."
00:11:04.680,00:11:06.760,The situation with Alex is very clear.
00:11:06.840,00:11:09.920,I think every single member of this team wants to see him succeed.
00:11:11.760,00:11:16.360,"He's aware, you know, that… he needs to step it up."
00:11:17.440,00:11:22.160,"The problem is if he doesn't, there are gonna be some difficult decisions to be made."
00:11:27.480,00:11:30.960,I know there's always gonna be pressure on the second seat at Red Bull.
00:11:31.640,00:11:42.520,All I know is that I've got two races to show them… Shaping up to be another good weekend for you.
00:11:42.600,00:11:43.480,Great performance.
00:11:43.560,00:11:46.480,Your race pace got the big boys worried.
00:11:46.560,00:11:48.520,"Mercedes, Red Bull, they're all looking at you."
00:12:00.960,00:12:07.120,Sergio has done such a great job this year that you couldn't fail to recognize that.
00:12:15.640,00:12:17.520,I already have a bit of blue.
00:12:21.960,00:12:26.640,"And, uh, as a result, you know, he's put himself on the… on the radar."
00:12:37.800,00:12:42.400,"This is the Bahrain Grand Prix, round 15 of the Formula 1 World Championship."
00:12:42.920,00:12:48.360,The first of two races held right here in the Bahrain double-header over the next two weekends.
00:13:06.040,00:13:11.600,"his 98th pole of his career, with Bottas alongside him, then in third, Max Verstappen in the Red Bull."
00:13:11.680,00:13:16.080,"Alex Albon, after his accident during practice, he pulled off a terrific qualifying round."
00:13:16.160,00:13:19.040,"He starts fourth on the grid, one ahead of Pérez."
00:13:39.960,00:13:44.840,starting to get on their feet and watch what is about to unfold at the start of this Grand Prix.
00:14:07.280,00:14:10.680,Pérez coming up on the inside of Verstappen who is now in second place.
00:14:20.400,00:14:21.800,coming out of turn one.
00:14:27.000,00:14:32.240,Alex Albon in fourth trying to keep up with Sergio Pérez as he speeds into the distance ahead.
00:14:34.320,00:14:37.160,Grosjean still making moves to try and gain places.
00:15:06.000,00:15:08.080,About 140 miles an hour.
00:16:20.000,00:16:28.680,There are certain moments where silence falls on a racing track and you know what that means.
00:17:12.360,00:17:15.600,"I felt very, very vulnerable in that moment."
00:17:47.560,00:17:55.200,the fear kicks in because your instincts are… that you know what the reality is.
00:17:59.600,00:18:03.920,"When I saw the fireball, I couldn't believe this could happen in modern Formula 1 cars."
00:18:07.520,00:18:09.520,And a car shouldn't break in two.
00:18:21.080,00:18:25.760,The big question was where's… where's the rest of the car and where is the driver?
00:18:26.280,00:18:29.200,I did think that it would be a very bad outcome.
00:18:30.200,00:18:36.600,"As I looked to my right, I could see, uh, the driver through the… the gap in the flame."
00:19:40.920,00:19:46.400,"at 160 miles an hour, with… within a ball of fire..."
00:19:46.480,00:19:49.560,The heat must have been so extreme.
00:19:49.640,00:19:53.240,It was a miracle. It was absolutely a miracle.
00:20:06.720,00:20:13.200,"and I was insisting, No, no, no, no, we'll get the ambulance here, but he wanted to demonstrate that he was okay."
00:20:13.880,00:20:19.360,"He got a message to everyone, his wife and family in particular, that he was out and he was in a good place."
00:20:25.040,00:20:26.680,H… ho… how did he jump out?
00:20:27.880,00:20:29.760,That's… that's an act of God.
00:20:47.000,00:20:48.800,"but, uh, he's completely conscious."
00:20:48.880,00:20:52.360,"He had, what I was told, minor burns on his hands on his feet."
00:20:52.440,00:20:53.960,He's… he… he's okay.
00:20:54.040,00:20:57.880,They did a fantastic job to get him away as quick as possible from the fire.
00:20:57.960,00:21:00.920,"It was amazing, uh, what they did and thank you a lot to them."
00:21:05.480,00:21:08.760,"Fucking hell, they've done a great job. The guy with the extinguisher."
00:21:17.160,00:21:18.400,He got away with it.
00:21:19.400,00:21:22.400,Just have to say thank you to somebody up in heaven.
00:21:30.600,00:21:36.800,"and for those drivers, they now have to somehow get back in their cars and drive as if nothing has happened."
00:21:47.840,00:21:54.080,Focus on… on what you are about to do and then back in the car and go through it again.
00:22:01.320,00:22:05.560,"You make a decision, I'm going to continue, yep, and you just keep going."
00:22:07.040,00:22:14.560,It's just the wild desire to drive these cars on the limit and nothing's gonna change that.
00:22:30.560,00:22:33.480,Sergio Pérez and Max Verstappen on the inside.
00:22:33.560,00:22:36.000,Verstappen slips past the Racing Point.
00:22:41.200,00:22:43.000,Bottas was having none of it.
00:22:45.920,00:22:48.240,We have got an incident at the back there.
00:22:52.880,00:22:58.280,Racing Point can ill afford an incident like that for the Constructors' Championship.
00:23:02.160,00:23:07.160,"the man without a contract next season, to win points for the team that are letting him go."
00:23:33.840,00:23:36.720,Flying past and overtaking Pierre Gasly.
00:23:54.720,00:23:59.600,Can he bag himself a podium and stay ahead of Alex Albon in the Red Bull just behind him?
00:24:36.280,00:24:39.160,That's Sergio Pérez going slowly down the main straight.
00:25:00.800,00:25:02.680,for his second podium in Formula 1.
00:25:19.480,00:25:21.800,to win the Bahrain Grand Prix.
00:25:27.000,00:25:29.400,and a much-needed podium.
00:25:29.480,00:25:34.120,That will surely put him in a firm position to stay with Red Bull for next year.
00:25:44.520,00:25:46.760,Good to have you both up there on the podium.
00:25:53.080,00:25:54.320,"It's, uh, not to be."
00:26:11.160,00:26:13.920,"What's impressed me is when he's had knocks, he's bounced back."
00:26:18.520,00:26:24.160,"Of course I wanna stay here, and to stand on the podium was… was really special."
00:26:30.080,00:26:32.080,"on that podium, uh, this evening."
00:27:22.960,00:27:26.440,"to remind everyone how good I am, what I can do in the car."
00:27:28.320,00:27:30.280,And it's a big hit.
00:27:41.000,00:27:42.960,"for many, many years."
00:28:02.240,00:28:05.200,"As a Mexican, it's very hard to get into Formula 1."
00:28:07.800,00:28:09.440,And then you can see Pérez.
00:28:09.520,00:28:11.000,That was tight!
00:28:18.760,00:28:21.440,"You have to sacrifice your childhood, basically."
00:28:28.160,00:28:31.240,I was on my own while other kids were with their family.
00:28:39.880,00:28:41.680,it's a bit emotional.
00:28:45.280,00:28:50.920,"My target is to keep in Formula 1, but, um, I don't know what will happen."
00:29:00.320,00:29:01.560,and here we are.
00:29:01.640,00:29:03.320,Welcome back to Bahrain.
00:29:14.360,00:29:16.240,in this double-header in the desert.
00:34:02.000,00:34:04.560,-You are the man that crossed the road? -Yes.
00:35:30.400,00:35:32.760,at a brand-new circuit layout.
00:35:35.240,00:35:37.280,It's never been used before.
00:36:13.840,00:36:16.240,Still plenty of things that can happen.
00:36:16.320,00:36:19.360,I believe that I can finish on a high.
00:36:21.360,00:36:24.320,God knows I used all my opportunities I've had.
00:36:28.520,00:36:30.960,"So, whatever comes, I'm just ready for it."
00:36:51.160,00:36:54.080,but also new dynamics in the driver lineup.
00:36:54.160,00:36:58.640,"Lewis Hamilton is not racing, having tested positive for COVID-19."
00:36:58.720,00:37:02.560,He's replaced by George Russell on loan from Williams.
00:37:04.320,00:37:07.800,And all that means it's hard to make any predictions.
00:37:07.880,00:37:11.080,What unfolds next is in the lap of the Gods.
00:37:28.040,00:37:29.960,Sergio Pérez trying to challenge.
00:37:30.040,00:37:32.400,Russell takes the lead of the Grand Prix.
00:37:33.040,00:37:35.080,Valtteri Bottas is down to second.
00:37:36.880,00:37:39.720,"Ooh, and he gets all out of shape coming out of turn two."
00:37:39.800,00:37:42.520,That's gonna give Pérez and Verstappen the impetus they need.
00:37:43.840,00:37:45.880,Three wide up towards turn four.
00:38:11.720,00:38:14.960,Racing Point chasing third place in the championship.
00:38:15.560,00:38:19.960,They need points to keep them in contention to have their best ever season.
00:38:35.280,00:38:40.360,"Not how he would've liked to have seen his season, and his Formula 1 career, coming to an end."
00:38:57.760,00:38:59.640,as he overtakes the Alfa Romeo.
00:39:27.440,00:39:31.640,Slowly but surely coming back from last place to now move into the midfield.
00:39:37.320,00:39:39.560,the guy that's nicked his job for next year.
00:39:45.880,00:39:48.960,"He'll be in the points before too long, you' would've thought."
00:39:50.640,00:39:55.040,"Sergio Pérez gets Norris as well, using all his years of experience."
00:40:04.920,00:40:06.440,of the Red Bull pit wall.
00:40:06.520,00:40:09.640,I want your place now and I want your car next year.
00:41:20.480,00:41:23.200,to now be level with teammate Lance Stroll.
00:41:25.960,00:41:27.480,Pérez up into fourth.
00:41:31.560,00:41:37.160,"this could be a phenomenal result for Pérez, but also Racing Point, who now occupy fourth and fifth."
00:41:41.360,00:41:44.920,Pérez has been on it absolutely all day long.
00:41:45.000,00:41:46.400,"Oh, all right!"
00:42:12.920,00:42:15.280,Into the pits comes Russell from the race lead.
00:42:15.360,00:42:19.120,"Overshoots a little, but in he comes and Mercedes are double stacking here."
00:42:25.960,00:42:30.000,There's a man waving on the front left. They can't get the wheel on at all!
00:42:30.080,00:42:32.240,Disastrous pit stop for Mercedes.
00:42:50.720,00:42:52.000,driven by George Russell.
00:42:52.720,00:42:54.040,Here's Russell's radio.
00:43:01.080,00:43:03.200,Russell is going to have to pit again.
00:43:03.280,00:43:06.280,Absolute disaster for the Mercedes team.
00:43:20.240,00:43:22.320,Pérez now leading the Grand Prix.
00:43:35.440,00:43:38.160,having been in last place on the opening lap.
00:43:40.240,00:43:42.480,"And now, we're onto the final lap."
00:43:50.200,00:43:52.240,has just half a lap to go.
00:43:59.600,00:44:03.080,comes home to win the Sakhir Grand Prix.
00:45:00.480,00:45:06.400,"And it's the first ever double podium for Racing Point, as well, as Lance Stroll takes third place."
00:45:22.680,00:45:24.080,at the end of this season?
00:45:24.160,00:45:25.560,I… I really hope not.
00:45:42.000,00:45:44.560,"I think that's a tear in your eye, is it not, Otmar?"
00:46:07.520,00:46:10.640,I've learned so much. I've made so many friends here.
00:46:10.720,00:46:13.040,"Thanks so much for everything. All these years, man."
00:46:13.120,00:46:15.800,You guys have been amazing and you have a friend.
00:46:15.880,00:46:18.360,"Whenever you go to Mexico, please call me."
00:46:23.840,00:46:30.080,"seeing that my boys, you know, when it's… some of them were crying because we've been together for… for so many years."
00:46:31.000,00:46:32.120,Life is not fair at all.
00:46:34.280,00:46:35.240,Formula 1 neither.
00:47:17.280,00:47:20.280,"-At the beginning, you were lucky. -So lucky, man."
00:47:22.680,00:47:24.200,Congratulations. Amazing job.
00:47:30.240,00:47:37.920,"When I leave, I think I'll be very thankful to the sport, to Formula 1, because what they've given me, they've changed my life forever."
00:47:49.760,00:47:55.840,"If this is to be the end, I'm extremely pleased and… and happy for what I have achieved."
00:47:56.840,00:47:58.640,"So, thank you, Formula 1."
00:48:26.160,00:48:27.800,-Welcome to Red Bull. -How are you doing?
00:48:29.960,00:48:32.080,Congratulations and welcome to the team.
00:48:32.160,00:48:35.080,"Thanks, Christian. I'm so much looking forward to it."
00:48:35.680,00:48:40.000,Sergio Pérez is confirmed as our race driver for 2021.
00:48:53.560,00:48:57.040,"At the last race of the season, we still have this massive fight."
00:48:57.120,00:48:59.240,-We're in a good position. -It'll go down to the wire.
00:48:59.320,00:49:01.080,Who wants it more will probably do it.
00:49:07.160,00:49:10.840,"If you're gonna take on Mercedes, you've gotta be firing on all cylinders."
00:00:27.760,00:00:30.040,I can't believe you've recovered so quickly.
00:02:52.000,00:02:54.360,You think we should be competitive there?
00:03:39.920,00:03:40.880,"Nice job, mate."
00:03:40.960,00:03:43.600,Two or three more laps like this would be great.
00:03:46.040,00:03:48.160,"Okay, this is about my pace now."
00:05:06.160,00:05:07.760,"Is that a podium, boys?"
00:05:07.840,00:05:09.800,Is that a fucking podium?
00:05:11.040,00:05:12.760,It's a fucking podium!
00:05:15.400,00:05:16.960,"-Mega, man, mega. -Oh!"
00:05:26.480,00:05:28.720,"A fucking podium, Daniel! Thank you!"
00:05:30.880,00:05:42.600,"Every single lap that we see Daniel performing, a moment of of joy and satisfaction, of pleasure, but at the same time, it's negative emotion because we also measure what we'll be missing, what we'll be losing."
00:05:53.480,00:06:02.520,"For him, it was so important to make the point and to show that until the last lap of the last race, he will be loyal to his decision that he made a few years ago."
00:06:03.120,00:06:06.160,"I'm sorry, but yeah, it's… it's not complete."
00:06:06.240,00:06:07.680,It's not over yet.
00:06:32.080,00:06:35.640,"Well, you know what, if we do a podium, I'll do a tattoo!"
00:07:40.520,00:07:51.800,"I was not betting against my own luck, I was not betting against my own team, and I'm extremely happy to have to honor this obligation now that we've done this podium."
00:08:01.480,00:08:02.680,Fruit platter?
00:08:05.680,00:08:07.800,"No, it's not for him. No, no, no."
00:08:07.880,00:08:08.720,It's for us.
00:08:08.800,00:08:10.080,"No, leave it here."
00:08:10.160,00:08:11.840,I am the athlete. I need to hydrate.
00:08:11.920,00:08:14.120,What do you mean he's a very important person?
00:12:20.320,00:12:22.400,Pole position. That's a statement right there.
00:12:22.920,00:12:24.600,-Excellent job. -Yes!
00:12:24.680,00:12:26.280,"Come on, boys! Come on!"
00:12:29.320,00:12:31.800,"Ah, this feels good."
00:12:31.880,00:12:34.680,"Well done, boys. Amazing. Amazing."
00:12:40.600,00:12:42.280,P4. Get in.
00:12:42.360,00:12:43.360,Fuck yeah!
00:12:45.700,00:12:46.760,Nice.
00:14:22.400,00:14:25.800,"Brad, I wanna hear you say it, mate. That's pole position!"
00:14:26.320,00:14:27.800,I wanna hear you say it!
00:14:29.760,00:14:32.480,"That's pole position, Lance, pole position."
00:14:32.560,00:14:34.120,Let's go!
00:15:04.080,00:15:07.680,"Well done, Lance. P1 and P3 for the team."
00:15:08.240,00:15:09.480,"Well done, guys."
00:15:25.900,00:15:26.960,Are you okay?
00:15:27.800,00:15:28.960,"Yeah, I'm okay."
00:18:01.800,00:18:10.240,"Racing Point this season, clearly, no one was expecting a team of this size to be operating at that level."
00:18:11.120,00:18:18.440,"So, clearly, finishing on that podium of P3 for the Constructors' would be quite something for us."
00:19:09.320,00:19:12.360,"All right. Whatever happens today, thank you for everything."
00:19:12.440,00:19:13.440,Fuck some shit up.
00:19:14.040,00:19:15.120,Give everything.
00:19:15.760,00:19:17.320,"Yep. Thank you, boys."
00:19:17.400,00:19:18.560,Fifty-five laps.
00:19:18.640,00:19:19.840,Everything we got.
00:19:50.000,00:19:53.280,"Currently, your pace is faster than anyone up to P4."
00:19:53.960,00:19:55.160,Understood.
00:20:24.120,00:20:25.400,I'm losing power.
00:20:28.320,00:20:30.320,I lost the fucking engine again.
00:20:30.840,00:20:31.960,I'm off.
00:20:38.560,00:20:40.040,You're fucking kidding me!
00:20:47.000,00:20:49.880,-What happened? -Perez engine failure.
00:20:50.640,00:20:52.160,That's what I want to hear!
00:20:54.400,00:20:55.760,"Go on, Carlos!"
00:21:03.520,00:21:06.280,-Car behind is Norris. -Okay.
00:21:08.680,00:21:11.800,We should naturally be quicker than Ricciardo ahead.
00:21:11.880,00:21:13.000,"Yeah, confirm."
00:21:13.080,00:21:14.520,This is looking really good.
00:21:31.680,00:21:33.680,Ah! Brakes are shit!
00:21:37.120,00:21:38.880,We've got a tire problem.
00:21:38.960,00:21:40.920,We have no traction.
00:21:41.000,00:21:42.960,"I'm trying to brake, but I lock up."
00:21:55.760,00:21:59.640,It's unbelievable how bad we are at maintaining temperature.
00:22:55.200,00:22:57.000,Ocon has DRS.
00:22:57.080,00:22:58.400,"Brad, leave me alone."
00:22:58.480,00:22:59.400,Go!
00:23:04.560,00:23:05.520,Yeah!
00:23:16.120,00:23:17.520,Until the end there.
00:23:18.600,00:23:20.680,"Oh, well done, mate. Good effort."
00:23:29.840,00:23:31.320,"Oh, fuck."
00:23:32.680,00:23:35.720,"Thanks, guys. That was a nice way to send it off."
00:23:36.360,00:23:37.480,"Thank you, Daniel."
00:23:37.560,00:23:40.840,And we look forward to racing against you next year very much.
00:23:42.200,00:23:44.120,We can have a beer tonight.
00:23:44.200,00:23:45.040,Two.
00:23:47.840,00:23:48.960,"Congrats, everyone."
00:23:49.040,00:23:51.640,"Lando, great job. Great job, Lando!"
00:23:52.160,00:23:54.160,"-Cheers, Zak. -Yo, dude!"
00:23:54.240,00:23:57.880,"We all know you would've won the race, but, you know, we did our best."
00:23:57.960,00:23:59.520,Great job!
00:25:22.160,00:25:25.560,Daniel is a fantastic driver. I cannot not love Daniel.
00:25:25.640,00:25:27.920,I love Daniel. We all do.
00:25:29.720,00:25:38.760,"Everyone's life has sort of… these moments where you know you should be doing something and waiting and pushing, but procrastinating a bit."
00:25:39.360,00:25:42.960,Daniel is the one that has pushed us into doing the changes.
00:25:43.040,00:25:46.560,I'm not convinced we would have done those changes without Daniel.
00:25:58.760,00:26:01.040,Who's paying? You paying or I'm paying?
00:26:03.400,00:26:09.120,"He gets to choose a design and I think he's done that, and I get to choose the size and location and I've done that also."
00:26:09.200,00:26:10.600,Not too visible.
00:26:10.680,00:26:12.480,"Not a Mike Tyson thing, no."
00:33:33.680,00:33:34.720,Relax.
00:33:34.800,00:33:36.600,"I can't breathe, my face."
00:33:37.160,00:33:38.560,What are you on?
00:33:38.640,00:33:39.640,I can't breathe!
00:35:06.680,00:35:10.840,What's it been like for you to be the only Black Formula 1 driver?
00:00:22.680,00:00:24.440,It's the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
00:00:30.120,00:00:32.040,"Yeah. Me too, man."
00:00:32.880,00:00:33.960,Only just made it.
00:00:40.200,00:00:42.080,"It's been a year like, like no other."
00:00:45.840,00:00:50.200,Lewis Hamilton is a seven-time champion of the world.
00:00:51.160,00:00:55.160,I think what we've done as a team is… It's very special.
00:01:05.480,00:01:09.320,"If you're gonna take on Mercedes, you've gotta be firing on all cylinders."
00:01:18.360,00:01:20.360,You need to see that gap reduced.
00:01:24.200,00:01:27.560,And who will prevail in this epic battle for third?
00:01:30.200,00:01:31.640,We're in a very good position.
00:01:31.720,00:01:32.920,It's gonna go down to the wire.
00:01:33.000,00:01:35.040,Who wants it more will probably do it.
00:01:52.600,00:01:58.840,"The battle for third in the Constructors', it's absolutely incredible that we should be at the last race of the season… 'Sup?"
00:01:58.920,00:02:01.680,…and still have this massively important fight.
00:02:05.480,00:02:07.200,And now it's going down to the wire.
00:02:33.480,00:02:42.200,"It's a game where you want to make the most of other people's misfortunes, but, uh also realize that, at any point, things could happen to you."
00:02:43.320,00:02:49.280,"If anything, we thought Racing Point would be quite convincingly third, so we brought a very good fight to them."
00:02:49.360,00:02:51.920,And we knew it was gonna be a very tough fight with Renault.
00:02:55.120,00:03:00.960,I've never been so… probably excited about finishing third in a championship before.
00:03:02.080,00:03:03.760,It's been a hell of a battle.
00:03:06.120,00:03:10.880,"I mean, at times, Racing Point's been third, McLaren's been third, we've been third."
00:03:16.040,00:03:19.480,"and end the season on a strong note. That's, uh, you know, the hopes."
00:03:55.520,00:04:17.920,"Yeah, I think 'cause I'm, uh, I just have amazing natural abilities, uh, I'm the epitome of human high performance… It's just hard. It's just hard to be humble."
00:04:18.760,00:04:19.960,It's really hard!
00:04:21.520,00:04:22.920,I'm just kidding.
00:04:29.800,00:04:31.280,and goes second fastest.
00:04:38.200,00:04:44.760,"There's things I'm still… internally, I know I'm doing better, even if it's controlling the pressure, controlling the emotion."
00:04:45.800,00:05:02.600,"It's also experience, you know. It's… it's my tenth year, I think, in Formula 1 and I'm at that, probably at that nice balance now where I've got, still got the desire and the, let's say, the will to push the car to the limit, but I've also got now the knowledge and experience of being a tenth-year driver."
00:05:21.280,00:05:25.440,and gives Renault their first podium since Malaysia in 2011.
00:05:47.320,00:05:50.680,"The joy and, uh, the feeling was missed, so yeah, I'm very happy."
00:06:12.720,00:06:15.600,"It was if I get a podium, uh, he has to get a tattoo."
00:06:17.960,00:06:21.800,I probably threw it out there because I've got more than a tattoo or two.
00:06:21.880,00:06:24.400,"I was like, Why don't you get one? Do you have any?"
00:06:24.480,00:06:27.080,"He goes, No. I was like, That's it. Tattoo."
00:06:27.160,00:06:28.240,"So he was like, Okay."
00:06:42.520,00:06:43.960,and it's time to get it done.
00:06:52.840,00:06:54.920,"-For lunch? -We had it for dinner, it was cool."
00:06:57.360,00:07:10.760,"Sometimes, I give up, I'm like… There's some of the most, like, horrific tattoos."
00:07:19.200,00:07:21.000,That Homer Simpson one's awesome.
00:07:25.720,00:07:29.240,I spoke to him the other night about it. He reckons he's gonna get it on his ankle.
00:07:31.680,00:07:34.000,-But I think he feels it's like… Yeah. -It's hidden.
00:08:03.600,00:08:04.600,For you?
00:08:04.680,00:08:05.600,Thank you.
00:08:14.200,00:08:15.160,-He pays. -He pays.
00:08:15.240,00:08:16.440,But leave it here.
00:08:17.440,00:08:22.760,"So, battle for third, we are behind our friends there in Racing Point."
00:08:23.920,00:08:27.120,A few more than Renault and a few more than Ferrari.
00:08:28.720,00:08:33.600,We've gone all of a sudden from being the underdog to having a chance to win that midfield battle.
00:08:34.200,00:08:38.280,We are doing a good job of making it to the points with both cars.
00:08:39.040,00:08:55.360,"I think it's time for… a lot of people saw him as, you know, the driver within the team."
00:08:55.440,00:09:02.360,"That hit me hard because it's something I'd want more than anything, but then it switched, I think, quite heavily, as we came into the season."
00:09:02.440,00:09:08.080,"I started the year with a podium, then a lot more people saw me as being able to deliver when I need to."
00:09:08.160,00:09:09.680,"How's it going, dude?"
00:09:09.760,00:09:25.120,"I'm quite sore after, um… I think, you know, before the last race, we were split by one point. I was behind."
00:09:25.200,00:09:26.520,"Now, I'm one point ahead."
00:09:26.600,00:09:29.720,"-What do you play off, 12? -Uh, 16."
00:09:30.280,00:09:32.440,-Carlos is pretty good. -Yeah.
00:09:36.920,00:09:39.120,need to do a good job for the team.
00:09:39.200,00:09:42.400,We don't have one driver doing really well and one doing not well.
00:09:43.360,00:09:51.160,"We're pushing each other, and, uh, I think that's why we're probably the closest pairing or closest teammates on the grid consistently in qualifying and races."
00:09:57.520,00:10:10.440,"We'll miss Carlos. We've enjoyed our time racing with him, but, you know, we're… we're excited and, uh, in a couple of races' time, we'll be, uh, thinking all about, uh, Daniel and… and Lando, and hopefully, that'll take us yet to another level."
00:10:14.160,00:10:20.000,"What he brings, you know, why everyone says he's so special, why they say he's a better driver than the majority of the grid."
00:10:20.080,00:10:29.000,"Learning from him, you know, a multiple race winner, a guy who's worked with multiple different teams and so on, I just look forward to that next chapter of the story."
00:10:36.680,00:10:42.200,It's time for one final blast around the track ahead of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
00:10:42.280,00:10:44.760,It is the last qualifying of the season.
00:10:57.120,00:11:01.160,and the last five races have all been won by pole position here.
00:11:08.720,00:11:11.600,It's very much Red Bull versus Mercedes.
00:11:17.240,00:11:23.680,"that have been one and two in qualifying here, uh, for the last six Abu Dhabi Grand Prix."
00:11:28.320,00:11:30.160,just to get into Q3.
00:11:31.640,00:11:34.440,Also pressure on Lando Norris' McLaren.
00:11:36.240,00:11:37.960,Can he get into Q3?
00:11:42.000,00:11:46.160,"Lewis, then, really treating his tires extremely kindly on the out lap."
00:11:55.760,00:11:59.080,Hamilton crosses the line. He's back on pole position.
00:11:59.160,00:12:00.720,Who can deny him now?
00:12:08.600,00:12:11.120,He's gone best of all in the middle sector.
00:12:11.200,00:12:13.080,He was only a tenth down in the first.
00:12:13.160,00:12:16.440,Max Verstappen's taken pole in the season finale.
00:12:38.280,00:12:40.520,Gets to about 200 miles an hour.
00:12:52.920,00:12:56.320,and he misses out by just four hundredths of a second to his teammate.
00:12:56.400,00:12:57.880,That's a shocker.
00:13:03.160,00:13:05.120,Both Renaults are out.
00:13:11.560,00:13:14.280,That's going to make Racing Point uncomfortable.
00:13:44.920,00:13:46.000,Nice one.
00:13:50.680,00:13:54.400,"I look back and there's been quite a few, uh, highlights this season."
00:13:54.920,00:13:56.600,It's great when you do well.
00:13:56.680,00:13:58.760,I was on pole a few weeks ago.
00:14:02.240,00:14:05.000,Stroll crosses the line and he does go pole!
00:14:09.840,00:14:11.280,"Yes, boys!"
00:14:13.760,00:14:14.760,Let's go!
00:14:34.920,00:14:36.200,I love my job.
00:14:40.720,00:14:44.480,"which just shows what talent, uh, he has."
00:14:45.200,00:14:49.440,"And then after that, in Bahrain, we scored a significant amount of points."
00:15:01.400,00:15:03.320,as Lance Stroll takes third place.
00:15:11.560,00:15:16.440,"…you know, sometimes, um… you love the sport and it just don't love you back."
00:15:23.560,00:15:24.760,Massive accident.
00:15:29.680,00:15:32.560,Definitely wasn't a normal race after that happened.
00:15:38.240,00:15:41.040,That's Sergio Perez very much out of this race.
00:15:53.120,00:15:55.720,Some weekends are good and some weekends are bad.
00:16:01.000,00:16:02.440,"For sure, it sucks."
00:16:02.520,00:16:07.520,"Uh, none of us were happy walking away from that race, but I'm still learning."
00:16:17.360,00:16:19.240,"and, you know, be there more often."
00:16:19.320,00:16:43.880,"Um, I just turned 22, so, um, I do see myself getting better, 17 races and 3,249 racing miles, it is down to this to decide who gets that third spot in the Constructors' Championship."
00:16:54.040,00:16:57.320,why you'd wanna fight for third in the Constructors' Championship.
00:16:57.840,00:17:01.760,"It's not just about pride. It's big bucks. Big, big bucks."
00:17:03.680,00:17:06.920,Racing Point are ten points ahead of McLaren with one race to go.
00:17:07.000,00:17:08.480,That's an easy swing.
00:17:09.440,00:17:12.400,"I would have said a few races ago, it was Renault."
00:17:13.000,00:17:16.200,"However, McLaren are the ones that are right behind us."
00:17:21.280,00:17:27.280,Anything less than third in the Constructors' could be seen as a failure.
00:17:32.680,00:17:40.720,"and we've been ninth, sixth, fourth, and here we are, fighting so hard to finish third in the championship."
00:17:44.200,00:17:48.480,"12 points behind McLaren, who are in turn ten points behind Racing Point."
00:17:49.160,00:18:00.120,"Given all the water that's gone under the bridge this year between Racing Point and Renault, there's no way Cyril wants to lose third in the Constructors' Championship to that team."
00:18:04.000,00:18:05.880,"uh, clearly, uh."
00:18:40.280,00:18:42.440,Racing Point must be favorites.
00:18:42.520,00:18:48.520,"And in his last race for the team, only a fool would bet against Daniel Ricciardo and Renault."
00:18:52.440,00:18:53.760,Normal start.
00:18:58.840,00:19:01.600,I think we can pull it off. I think we can pull it off.
00:19:30.560,00:19:32.040,we're racing in 2020.
00:19:38.080,00:19:40.280,"Norris getting a good start, but behind Lewis Hamilton."
00:19:40.360,00:19:42.840,Into the first real big braking zone we go.
00:19:44.480,00:19:49.040,Daniel Ricciardo on the Ferrari at the hairpin and he's got himself ahead of Sebastian Vettel.
00:20:12.160,00:20:18.480,"Two points in it at the moment between McLaren and Racing Point, now that Lance Stroll has moved up into seventh place."
00:20:35.400,00:20:38.480,for Perez and the Racing Point team.
00:20:43.240,00:20:45.720,to finish third in the Constructors' Championship?
00:21:23.920,00:21:24.840,Nice job.
00:21:48.320,00:21:51.480,Pierre Gasly has gone down the inside of Lance Stroll.
00:21:51.560,00:21:55.240,He's gone past the Racing Point. They did touch as Gasly went through.
00:22:02.240,00:22:05.200,because Esteban Ocon's catching at a rate of knots.
00:22:10.680,00:22:13.320,he's led every single lap of the race.
00:22:14.760,00:22:18.200,"As he rounds the final corner, the checkered flag's in sight."
00:22:18.280,00:22:28.240,Verstappen wins the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and rounds off the season in perfect fashion for himself and for Red Bull.
00:22:34.480,00:22:37.680,"and his teammate Carlos Sainz, home in sixth position."
00:22:41.880,00:22:42.920,Yeah!
00:22:53.200,00:22:55.120,in the battle for ninth place.
00:23:11.800,00:23:14.440,It's gonna be Esteban Ocon to finish in ninth place.
00:23:23.120,00:23:25.120,that Racing Point wanted and needed.
00:24:01.200,00:24:02.400,Woo!
00:24:02.480,00:24:04.760,"Well, luck is, uh, definitely a part of sport."
00:24:04.840,00:24:09.280,"I think you create your own, uh, luck by working very hard and having great people."
00:24:09.800,00:24:16.960,"I think this year, there's more hard work and grit and determination that's gone into it, which is another step, a lot more money for the team."
00:24:17.560,00:24:21.440,Getting that third spot's part of that story I'm trying to make with McLaren.
00:24:21.960,00:24:25.200,"Getting back to that, winning races and winning championships again."
00:24:25.800,00:24:42.000,"We only did it in the last race, so it was close, but, um, as long as we improve some races, my engineer does a better job, um… …then I look forward to another season next year where we can hopefully do a bit better."
00:25:00.440,00:25:03.680,I think kind of breaking any relationship is… is never easy.
00:25:04.200,00:25:10.840,"I look back now, and I look back at the start of 2019 and where we are now and yeah, we really did build something."
00:25:14.480,00:25:18.760,I'm stoked that we can part ways knowing that it was… it was a really nice two years.
00:25:46.640,00:25:52.800,"Credit to Cyril, he actually called me 'cause he obviously, he really wants to honor the bet."
00:25:52.880,00:25:58.680,"And I said, With lockdown, the way Europe is at the moment, it's difficult, so it'll probably have to wait 'til next year."
00:26:18.240,00:26:23.840,"and then maybe with, like, a little bit of, uh, a honey badger involvement in there."
00:26:23.920,00:26:46.920,"But I don't wanna make it too, like, cheesy or anything, but it should also be something that maybe he looks at and giggles, We should have come third, but it's not easy to do."
00:26:47.000,00:26:52.880,"Next year, our driver line-up is, uh, Lance and Sebastian, four-time world champion, a veteran."
00:26:57.600,00:26:59.680,of working with world-championship teams.
00:27:02.960,00:27:11.960,"with an experienced driver is the right thing to do, and who better to learn from than Sebastian Vettel, who's a four-time world champion?"
00:27:12.720,00:27:21.680,"Lance can learn from Seb and, uh, and hone it such that he too, in the future, can aspire to become a world champion, so I think we got a great combination."
00:27:23.360,00:27:26.920,"Next year, Lawrence has big ambitions for the team."
00:27:29.600,00:27:33.360,"Aston Martin is coming in, a great name for Formula 1."
00:27:33.440,00:27:38.480,"Ultimately, it's all about on-track performance and there's a lot that goes into that."
00:27:39.080,00:27:44.880,"And that's what Lawrence wants to do, that's what we're gonna focus on in the next two, three, four, five years."
00:27:44.960,00:27:45.840,Good morning.
00:27:46.800,00:27:50.120,The heart and soul of this company started with its racing.
00:27:50.200,00:27:52.560,This is the factory where the cars are built.
00:27:52.640,00:27:58.520,"And then, to support its racing, built the most luxurious bespoke automobiles."
00:28:04.680,00:28:10.440,and align it with these great bunch of guys that is currently today Racing Point.
00:28:10.520,00:28:14.240,"It's, I believe, the most exciting thing to happen in Formula 1 in decades."
00:28:20.600,00:28:24.880,"That link with James Bond, that 1960s chic."
00:28:26.160,00:28:27.840,"It's very, very cool."
00:28:28.480,00:28:36.480,"You get so excited, seeing all this luxury product, bring Formula 1 to market it and put it on track next year, it's very beautiful."
00:28:37.760,00:28:40.400,This is where we have our design center.
00:28:40.920,00:28:46.120,"Marek Reichman, our chief creative director, and his people… Hello, Marek."
00:28:46.200,00:28:53.120,…are about to show me the visuals of what our cars will look like for next year on the grid.
00:28:55.880,00:29:03.600,"What we have developed is a very modern green color, which has a dichromatic effect over it. What does that mean?"
00:29:03.680,00:29:05.640,It means it really sparkles in the sunlight.
00:29:08.480,00:29:10.680,This looks like it's going faster standing still.
00:29:10.760,00:29:11.800,Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.
00:29:11.880,00:29:15.280,We gotta make sure it's fast on the track. That's great.
00:29:16.120,00:29:24.520,"So, if there's been a lot of jealousy on track of our performance this year, there's gonna be a lot more jealousy from our competitors when they see how good and quick we are next year."
00:29:29.880,00:29:30.880,It's a difficult year.
00:29:30.960,00:29:38.120,"When the pandemic started, we didn't know if we were gonna be still here or not and we needed to do tough decisions about the drivers."
00:29:40.320,00:29:43.840,Thank you to all of you and thank you for the time we had here with Kevin.
00:29:43.920,00:29:46.360,"There is obviously ups and downs, but that's life."
00:29:51.600,00:29:53.600,"Next year, we'll have Mick Schumacher."
00:29:53.680,00:29:55.960,"This year, he was first in the F2 Championship."
00:29:58.200,00:30:01.400,-This is the race helmet from 2012. -Thank you. It's such an honor.
00:30:01.480,00:30:03.280,I really appreciate that. Thank you.
00:30:03.360,00:30:05.560,-And Nikita Mazepin. -Yeah!
00:30:13.840,00:30:17.760,"For the future Haas F1 team, I need sponsors, uh, uh, to survive."
00:30:17.840,00:30:19.320,I'm very happy to have him on board.
00:30:30.000,00:30:32.960,"Now we've got a lineup of young drivers, which is great."
00:30:33.040,00:30:38.320,"Carlos did very well through the 2020, and he's bringing some know-how and experience."
00:30:38.400,00:30:40.360,He will fit very well with Charles.
00:30:40.440,00:30:46.240,"Both young, but already experienced drivers, so I think it's solid foundations for the future."
00:30:52.480,00:30:57.200,"We've beaten Mercedes at, arguably, one of their most dominant venues."
00:30:57.280,00:30:58.600,It wasn't a lucky win.
00:30:58.680,00:31:02.840,It was a pole position and a straight fight against the two Mercedes.
00:31:03.760,00:31:07.520,Mercedes produced the most competitive car they've ever done this year.
00:31:07.600,00:31:10.640,They are the benchmark currently in Formula 1.
00:31:10.720,00:31:14.800,They have dominated the sport for the last six years.
00:31:15.400,00:31:17.800,"To beat them, you've got to be at the top of your game."
00:31:17.880,00:31:20.240,We got ahead of them by the end of the year.
00:31:20.320,00:31:24.720,"It took a monumental effort, but we've demonstrated it's possible."
00:31:31.960,00:31:33.000,it's achievable.
00:31:33.520,00:31:37.880,We've just got to do it over 23 races rather than over one race.
00:31:42.160,00:31:48.040,"We've been unbeatable again in 2020 as a team and, um, it doesn't happen for no reason."
00:31:51.880,00:31:55.280,Mercedes create an absolute monster of a machine.
00:31:55.800,00:32:08.120,"I think, when you reflect on the seventh consecutive title, you have that moment of satisfaction, but that passes quickly."
00:32:09.280,00:32:15.120,"You think about the next race and you think about the next year, what you need to do in order to stay competitive."
00:32:23.520,00:32:27.400,Toto Wolff has signed up for Mercedes for another three years.
00:32:34.800,00:32:37.160,which means traveling to all Grand Prix.
00:32:37.680,00:32:40.720,I've spent 250 hotel nights last year.
00:32:41.360,00:32:43.520,More than 700 hours in an airplane.
00:32:44.200,00:32:48.160,And you start to ask yourself how much longer can you do that?
00:32:53.040,00:32:54.160,I'm not gonna walk away.
00:32:59.160,00:33:07.280,"So, in a way, you need to decide whether you want to be on the dance floor or on the balcony and I'm on the dance floor at the moment."
00:33:07.360,00:33:11.160,"But one day, I'd like to be on the balcony and oversee the whole situation."
00:33:17.520,00:33:18.800,with seven titles.
00:33:45.120,00:33:50.280,"All of a sudden, things that have been suppressed over my lifetime bubbled to the surface."
00:33:51.200,00:33:54.560,And I was like… I can no longer stay quiet.
00:33:56.840,00:34:01.080,"Every Black kid in the world will, at some stage, experience racism."
00:34:01.160,00:34:02.720,It's just a fact.
00:34:02.800,00:34:10.840,"When people call you names and the N-word's thrown around, you're told to go back to your own country when you're in your own country."
00:34:11.360,00:34:20.080,"There are literally millions and millions of people who will have experienced much, much worse, and that needs to change."
00:34:29.960,00:34:34.800,"but lately, um, if anybody has said anything to me, I just ignore them."
00:34:37.480,00:34:44.760,"For someone to look down at a young eight-year-old and tell them they're not gonna achieve anything in life, they must be in a really bad place."
00:34:46.920,00:34:50.800,the fact that he was the only Black face on the track became an issue.
00:34:53.240,00:34:55.520,Tread carefully. Be careful what you say.
00:34:55.600,00:35:01.680,"We don't get involved with, um, people who have problems about whether we win or whether… what color we are."
00:35:01.760,00:35:04.000,We go out on the track and we do our best.
00:35:14.720,00:35:23.840,"Why me? Why am I the… the only Black driver that's come along and had the ability, not only to get in the sport, but be at the front of it for so long?"
00:35:24.360,00:35:26.920,"That's okay. I mean, I've been built for this."
00:35:35.960,00:35:37.200,I remember the struggle.
00:35:37.280,00:35:45.880,"I remember how hard it was for my mum with the multiple jobs she had to keep a roof over mine and my two sisters', uh, heads."
00:35:45.960,00:35:49.520,I remember how it was for my dad to keep me racing.
00:35:50.920,00:35:55.000,"So, I… I know how hard it was."
00:35:55.720,00:36:08.640,"And then, on top of that, that other struggle with acceptance and not fitting in, that's all bubbled up into, hmm, you know… created the beast, I guess, that you see on the track."
00:36:16.600,00:36:18.640,in Formula 1 history.
00:36:19.280,00:36:21.920,"The way I'm wired, I… I don't really have a filter."
00:36:22.000,00:36:29.440,I say what's on my mind and I'm not always too bothered about upsetting someone if it's gonna make a difference.
00:36:35.600,00:36:39.040,"when you do have that success, what are you gonna do with it?"
00:36:40.400,00:36:49.040,"I'll be damned if I'm gonna win all these championships and have all this success and not, um, use it to make change."
