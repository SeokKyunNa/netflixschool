00:03:11.942,00:03:12.818,Thing of beauty.
00:03:19.240,00:03:21.326,"MASCULINE VOICE: Good morning, sir."
00:03:21.368,00:03:23.578,Yet another on-time delivery from...
00:03:23.620,00:03:26.707,"Get the hell out of my face, canner."
00:03:26.748,00:03:29.208,Have a nice day.
00:03:30.544,00:03:35.924,And we believe our Destination: Anywhere package to be the best value ever.
00:03:35.966,00:03:41.471,Let us take you to your dream destination aboard our auto-space flight...
00:03:51.231,00:03:55.152,"Glowfish, the world's hottest-selling transgenic..."
00:03:59.364,00:04:01.491,"ROBOT: Excuse me, sir."
00:04:01.533,00:04:05.537,"...total readiness, total security."
00:04:05.579,00:04:07.539,So good-bye to lengthy upgrades and service calls.
00:04:07.581,00:04:13.461,An uplink to USR's central computer provides this state-of-the-art robot with new programs daily.
00:04:13.503,00:04:16.965,The Nestor Class Five is tomorrow's robot today.
00:04:17.007,00:04:21.344,YOUNG MAN: Spoon! Spoony!
00:04:21.386,00:04:22.387,Hey!
00:04:23.638,00:04:25.182,Uh... hold up.
00:04:25.224,00:04:27.392,"Hold on, hold on."
00:04:27.434,00:04:29.228,"Spoon, man, where you been at?"
00:04:29.269,00:04:31.063,"Ah, just away, Farber."
00:04:31.105,00:04:33.190,On vacation and stuff?
00:04:33.232,00:04:34.315,"Listen, I got a favor to ask."
00:04:34.357,00:04:36.568,"I need to borrow the car for, like, ten, 15 minutes."
00:04:36.610,00:04:37.611,"No, no, this is different."
00:04:37.652,00:04:39.154,"This is different, Spoon."
00:04:39.196,00:04:40.405,"Listen, I got this fine-ass little yummie."
00:04:40.447,00:04:41.823,"I mean, she is complete and agreeable."
00:04:41.865,00:04:43.742,"I mean, ass-hot spankable, Spoon."
00:04:43.784,00:04:45.827,What does that even mean?
00:04:45.869,00:04:48.580,"Okay? Now, stop barricading, let me get the damn-ass keys, Spoon."
00:04:48.622,00:04:51.332,"First of all, stop cussing, 'cause you're not good at it."
00:04:51.374,00:04:53.418,"Let me get ten for the bus, then, man. I been there for you."
00:04:53.460,00:04:55.378,Go home.
00:04:55.420,00:04:57.714,That's strike one.
00:05:09.143,00:05:12.604,What are you going to do for us?
00:05:18.359,00:05:19.694,You talk to Marci?
00:05:21.196,00:05:23.490,"No, Gigi, I haven't talked to Marci."
00:05:23.531,00:05:29.454,"GIGI: When I was coming up, we didn't just marry someone, then divorce them, then not talk to them..."
00:05:30.747,00:05:32.457,"Del, don't play with me."
00:05:32.499,00:05:37.296,"I'll bet if I stop cooking, you'd call Marci."
00:05:37.336,00:05:40.966,"Boy, what is that on your feet?"
00:05:41.008,00:05:42.217,Mm.
00:05:42.259,00:05:45.053,"Converse All-Stars, vintage 2004."
00:05:46.221,00:05:47.346,Don't turn your face up like that.
00:05:47.388,00:05:48.515,I know you want some.
00:05:48.556,00:05:49.850,All you got to do is ask.
00:05:49.891,00:05:51.101,"No, thank you very much."
00:05:51.143,00:05:52.351,Mm.
00:05:52.393,00:05:54.104,Sweet potato pie.
00:05:54.146,00:05:55.563,Put that on the plate.
00:05:55.605,00:06:01.153,"You know, I've seen on TV they're giving away some of them new robots in the lottery."
00:06:01.195,00:06:03.322,"You know, Gigi..."
00:06:03.362,00:06:05.406,those robots don't do anybody any good.
00:06:05.448,00:06:08.827,"Of all the people on God's earth, you should know better."
00:06:08.869,00:06:12.039,Sometimes the stuff that comes out of your mouth.
00:06:14.249,00:06:16.210,"You listening to me, Del?"
00:06:27.637,00:06:30.849,MAN: Hey! Hey!
00:06:34.186,00:06:35.229,Hold my pie.
00:06:35.270,00:06:37.231,"Sir, hold it or wear it."
00:06:42.485,00:06:43.611,Hey!
00:06:43.653,00:06:45.113,Move it!
00:06:50.869,00:06:52.579,Hey! Hey!
00:06:52.620,00:06:54.455,Freeze!
00:06:58.335,00:06:59.586,Hey! Stop!
00:07:08.678,00:07:10.805,Stop!
00:07:16.353,00:07:17.645,I said stop!
00:07:19.606,00:07:21.900,Relax. Relax.
00:07:21.942,00:07:23.610,I'm a police officer.
00:07:23.651,00:07:25.612,WOMAN: You...
00:07:25.653,00:07:28.156,...are a asshole.
00:07:28.198,00:07:31.034,"Ma'am, is that your purse?"
00:07:31.076,00:07:32.660,Of course it's my purse.
00:07:32.702,00:07:33.912,I left my inhaler at home.
00:07:33.954,00:07:35.705,He was running it out to me.
00:07:35.747,00:07:38.959,"I saw a robot running with the purse, and naturally, I-I assumed..."
00:07:39.000,00:07:41.586,What? Are you crazy?
00:07:41.628,00:07:44.131,"I'm sorry for this misunderstanding, Officer."
00:07:44.172,00:07:46.841,Don't apologize-- you're doing what you're supposed to be doing.
00:07:46.883,00:07:48.427,But what are you doing?
00:07:50.011,00:07:52.264,"Have a lovely day, ma'am."
00:07:52.306,00:07:55.350,"You're lucky I can't breathe, or I'd walk all up and down your ass."
00:08:15.203,00:08:16.621,Super Spoon.
00:08:16.663,00:08:18.581,OFFICER 2: Right.
00:08:18.623,00:08:22.585,Lead by example.
00:08:22.627,00:08:25.630,It says that right on your badge.
00:08:25.672,00:08:26.714,So we gonna talk about this?
00:08:26.756,00:08:28.216,About what?
00:08:28.258,00:08:29.426,DETECTIVE: Help! Police!
00:08:29.468,00:08:30.760,That robot stole my dry cleaning.
00:08:32.053,00:08:33.847,"Oh, you want to talk about that?"
00:08:35.765,00:08:38.268,Detective...
00:08:38.310,00:08:40.354,how many robots have ever snatched a purse?
00:08:40.395,00:08:41.813,"John, the thing is running down the s..."
00:08:41.855,00:08:43.064,Uh-uh. Mm-mm.
00:08:43.106,00:08:46.818,How many robots...
00:08:43.106,00:08:48.736,in the world have ever committed a crime?
00:08:48.778,00:08:49.988,"Well, define crime."
00:08:50.030,00:08:51.698,"Answer my question, damn it."
00:08:51.739,00:08:52.866,"None, John."
00:08:55.160,00:08:57.371,"Now, tell me what happened today."
00:08:58.872,00:09:00.748,Nothing.
00:09:02.292,00:09:04.669,Better be the last nothing.
00:09:10.509,00:09:13.720,"Spoon, are you sure you are ready to be back?"
00:09:13.761,00:09:15.722,'Cause you can take your time.
00:09:15.763,00:09:19.267,"I'm fine, John. Thank you."
00:09:19.309,00:09:23.021,Better here than sitting around at home.
00:09:28.776,00:09:30.862,Homicide. Spooner.
00:09:44.292,00:09:47.128,FEMALE VOICE: Please take the next exit to your right.
00:09:59.433,00:10:02.394,"COMPUTER: Welcome, Detective Spooner."
00:10:07.065,00:10:09.234,Welcome to U.S. Robotics.
00:10:09.276,00:10:11.819,You have entered the garage-level lobby.
00:10:11.861,00:10:16.199,Please use the elevators for direct access to the main-level concourse.
00:10:16.241,00:10:18.785,Thank you.
00:10:18.826,00:10:20.828,"Good to see you again, son."
00:10:20.870,00:10:22.997,"Hello, Doctor."
00:10:23.039,00:10:26.960,Everything that follows is the result of what you see here.
00:10:27.001,00:10:29.212,Is there something you want to tell me?
00:10:29.254,00:10:31.881,"I'm sorry, my responses are limited."
00:10:31.923,00:10:33.800,You must ask the right questions.
00:10:33.841,00:10:37.011,Why did you call me?
00:10:37.053,00:10:39.806,I trust your judgment.
00:10:39.847,00:10:42.809,"Normally, these circumstances wouldn't require a homicide detective."
00:10:42.850,00:10:46.813,"But, then, our interactions have never been entirely normal, wouldn't you agree?"
00:10:46.854,00:10:49.983,You got that right.
00:10:50.024,00:10:53.027,Is there something you want to say to me?
00:10:53.069,00:10:56.490,"I'm sorry, my responses are limited."
00:10:56.531,00:10:59.659,You must ask the right questions.
00:10:59.700,00:11:02.078,Why would you kill yourself?
00:11:02.120,00:11:05.957,"That, Detective, is the right question."
00:11:08.751,00:11:10.003,Program terminated.
00:11:29.147,00:11:32.526,"Bye, old man."
00:11:46.623,00:11:48.041,"Afternoon, boys."
00:11:48.082,00:11:49.501,"TECH: Hey, Detective."
00:11:49.543,00:11:51.503,Enlighten me.
00:11:51.545,00:11:53.046,Massive impact trauma.
00:11:53.087,00:11:56.633,U.S. Robotics-- I got to get my kid something.
00:11:56.675,00:11:58.134,SPOONER: Anything upstairs?
00:11:58.176,00:12:00.136,Nada.
00:12:00.178,00:12:02.138,Door was security-locked from the inside.
00:12:02.180,00:12:04.599,"Wham, splat."
00:12:11.898,00:12:15.734,"EXECUTIVE: Okay, guys, we got to be smart about this-- let's deal with it later."
00:12:15.776,00:12:18.446,Detective.
00:12:18.488,00:12:20.615,Lawrence Robertson.
00:12:20.657,00:12:22.075,Wow.
00:12:22.116,00:12:23.993,Richest man in the world.
00:12:24.035,00:12:25.995,I've seen you on television.
00:12:26.037,00:12:28.248,Can I offer you coffee?
00:12:28.289,00:12:30.417,"Uh, sure, why not?"
00:12:34.212,00:12:37.840,I don't think anyone saw this coming.
00:12:37.882,00:12:39.758,"You know, I-I should have, I suppose."
00:12:39.800,00:12:41.261,I knew him 20 years.
00:12:41.302,00:12:43.137,Alfred practically invented robotics.
00:12:43.179,00:12:45.973,He wrote the Three Laws.
00:12:46.015,00:12:52.230,"But I guess, you know, brilliant people often have the most persuasive demons."
00:12:52.272,00:12:53.856,"So whatever I can do to help, just..."
00:12:53.898,00:12:56.526,Sugar.
00:12:56.568,00:12:59.153,For the coffee. Sugar?
00:12:59.195,00:13:00.321,Ah.
00:13:00.363,00:13:03.241,"Oh, you thought I was calling you sugar."
00:13:03.283,00:13:04.325,"Hey, you're not that rich."
00:13:04.367,00:13:05.826,It's on the table.
00:13:05.868,00:13:07.786,Thank you.
00:13:09.748,00:13:14.085,"Uh, when Lanning fell, he was holding the, uh, the little green..."
00:13:14.127,00:13:15.503,The holographic projector.
00:13:15.545,00:13:17.088,"Right, right."
00:13:17.130,00:13:19.257,Why do you think Lanning's hologram would've called me?
00:13:19.299,00:13:21.301,I assumed you knew him.
00:13:21.342,00:13:23.553,Yeah. I knew him.
00:13:23.595,00:13:25.472,"Well, holograms are very simple programs."
00:13:25.513,00:13:29.976,They're just prerecorded responses designed to give the impression of intelligence.
00:13:30.017,00:13:32.937,"Apparently, this one was programmed to call you upon his suicide."
00:13:32.979,00:13:34.439,Death.
00:13:34.481,00:13:36.775,I'm sorry?
00:13:34.481,00:13:39.444,The hologram-- it was programmed to call me in the event of Lanning's death.
00:13:39.486,00:13:42.113,"Yeah, suicide is a type of death, Detective."
00:13:45.617,00:13:48.411,"Look, please don't misunderstand my impatience."
00:13:48.453,00:13:49.746,"Oh, no, no. Go, go, go."
00:13:51.205,00:13:53.916,"Yeah, a really big week for you folks around here."
00:13:53.958,00:13:55.335,Yeah.
00:13:55.376,00:13:57.378,Got to put a robot in every home.
00:13:57.420,00:13:59.380,"Look, this is..."
00:13:57.420,00:14:02.717,"this is not what I do, but I got an idea for one of your commercials."
00:14:02.759,00:14:10.350,"You could see a carpenter making a beautiful chair, and then one of your robots comes in and makes a better chair, twice as fast."
00:14:10.391,00:14:16.606,"And then you superimpose on the screen, USR-- Shitting on the Little Guy."
00:14:16.648,00:14:18.358,Ah.
00:14:18.399,00:14:19.609,That would be the fade-out.
00:14:19.651,00:14:21.402,"Yeah, I see."
00:14:21.444,00:14:23.571,I suppose your father lost his job to a robot.
00:14:23.613,00:14:28.075,"I don't know, maybe you simply would've banned the Internet to keep the libraries open."
00:14:30.453,00:14:32.288,Prejudice never shows much reason.
00:14:32.330,00:14:36.250,"No, you know, I suspect you simply don't like their kind."
00:14:36.292,00:14:44.467,"Well, you got a business to run around here, and the last thing you need, especially this week, is a dead guy in your lobby."
00:14:44.509,00:14:51.265,"But, hell, seeing as how you got one, maybe I'll look around, ask a few questions, do the whole cop thing, you know?"
00:14:51.307,00:14:53.685,I'll send someone to escort you.
00:14:53.727,00:14:54.853,Thank you very much.
00:15:07.490,00:15:10.702,Lawrence told me to accommodate you in any way possible.
00:15:10.744,00:15:12.662,Really!
00:15:12.704,00:15:14.706,Okay.
00:15:14.748,00:15:17.291,I reviewed Dr. Lanning's psych profile.
00:15:18.793,00:15:20.420,Alfred had become a recluse.
00:15:20.461,00:15:23.047,He rejected human contact for machines.
00:15:23.089,00:15:25.759,"So you're a shrink, huh?"
00:15:25.800,00:15:28.302,My ex-wife will sure be glad I'm talking to you.
00:15:28.344,00:15:29.970,"You don't know her, do you?"
00:15:30.012,00:15:32.306,"I'm sorry, are you being funny?"
00:15:32.348,00:15:34.517,I guess not.
00:15:34.559,00:15:36.352,ELEVATOR: Level Ten.
00:15:36.394,00:15:40.774,"So, would you say that Dr. Lanning was suicidal?"
00:15:40.815,00:15:43.443,It would seem the answer to that question is apparent.
00:15:43.484,00:15:45.403,That's not what I asked you.
00:15:47.280,00:15:49.240,"No, I wouldn't have thought so."
00:15:49.282,00:15:51.659,But obviously I was wrong.
00:15:54.829,00:15:56.623,That's a long way down.
00:15:56.664,00:16:00.376,You people sure do clean up quickly around here.
00:16:00.418,00:16:01.461,"I can't blame you, though."
00:16:01.502,00:16:04.004,"I mean, who wants some old guy going bad in the lobby."
00:16:04.046,00:16:05.548,He was not some old guy.
00:16:05.590,00:16:08.551,Alfred Lanning was everything here.
00:16:08.593,00:16:12.639,We are on the eve of the largest robotic distribution in history.
00:16:12.680,00:16:16.559,"By Saturday, there'll be one robot to every five humans."
00:16:16.601,00:16:18.561,These robots are the realization of a dream.
00:16:18.603,00:16:20.563,Dr. Lanning's dream.
00:16:20.605,00:16:22.315,You know what?
00:16:22.356,00:16:26.402,"In that dream of his, I bet you he wasn't dead."
00:16:28.571,00:16:30.740,You keep 24-hour surveillance?
00:16:30.782,00:16:32.408,Obviously-- company policy.
00:16:32.450,00:16:33.618,Where are the feeds?
00:16:33.660,00:16:34.702,Sensor strips.
00:16:35.995,00:16:38.456,Everywhere but the service areas.
00:16:38.498,00:16:40.625,They link to our positronic operating core.
00:16:45.087,00:16:47.507,Wow.
00:16:47.548,00:16:49.133,Thermostat wasn't good enough.
00:16:49.175,00:16:50.927,You went and gave the building a brain.
00:16:50.969,00:16:53.471,She was actually Lanning's first creation.
00:16:53.513,00:16:55.682,She? That's a she?
00:16:55.723,00:16:57.684,Definitely need to get out more.
00:16:57.725,00:17:00.603,Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence.
00:17:00.645,00:17:02.522,SPOONER: VIKI?
00:17:02.563,00:17:04.941,Good day.
00:17:04.983,00:17:06.860,VIKI designed most of Chicago's protective systems.
00:17:06.901,00:17:11.071,I have decreased traffic fatalities by nine percent this year alone.
00:17:11.113,00:17:12.239,"Ooh, thanks."
00:17:12.281,00:17:15.785,Show me inside the lab from one minute prior to the window break.
00:17:18.872,00:17:20.331,Apologies.
00:17:20.373,00:17:23.459,There appears to be data corruption.
00:17:23.501,00:17:27.672,SPOONER: Show me outside the lab from the window break until now.
00:17:36.347,00:17:39.308,"Wow, look, you have great posture, you see?"
00:17:39.350,00:17:41.769,"You stand really straight, I... I'm slouching."
00:17:41.811,00:17:43.771,Would you like to go inside now?
00:17:43.813,00:17:45.648,"Oh, sure."
00:17:47.441,00:17:49.652,VIKI: Authorized entry.
00:17:57.159,00:18:01.539,"So, Dr. Calvin, what exactly do you do around here?"
00:18:01.581,00:18:04.709,My general fields are advanced robotics and psychiatry.
00:18:04.751,00:18:12.425,Although I specialize in hardware to wetware interfaces in an effort to advance USR's robotic anthropomorphization program.
00:18:12.466,00:18:14.552,"So, what exactly do you do around here?"
00:18:14.594,00:18:17.680,I make the robots seem more human.
00:18:17.722,00:18:19.223,Now wasn't that easier to say?
00:18:19.265,00:18:22.351,"Not really, no."
00:18:42.789,00:18:45.291,Hansel and Gretel.
00:18:45.332,00:18:47.167,Is that on the USR reading list?
00:18:47.209,00:18:50.212,Not precisely.
00:18:58.554,00:19:00.306,What in God's name are you doing?
00:19:00.347,00:19:03.183,Did you know that was safety glass?
00:19:03.225,00:19:07.187,"Be pretty difficult for an old man to throw hisself through that, don't you think?"
00:19:07.229,00:19:09.231,"Well, he figured out a way."
00:19:10.650,00:19:12.068,Uh-huh.
00:19:12.110,00:19:14.570,"Detective, the room was security locked."
00:19:14.612,00:19:17.657,"No one came or went, you saw that yourself."
00:19:17.698,00:19:20.034,Doesn't that mean this has to be suicide?
00:19:20.076,00:19:21.535,Yup.
00:19:22.912,00:19:24.497,Unless the killer's still in here.
00:19:27.708,00:19:30.878,"You're joking, right?"
00:19:30.920,00:19:32.130,This is ridiculous.
00:19:32.171,00:19:35.967,"Yeah, I know-- the Three Laws: your perfect circle of protection."
00:19:36.009,00:19:40.721,A robot cannot harm a human being-- the First Law of Robotics.
00:19:40.763,00:19:42.473,"Yeah, I know, I've seen your commercials."
00:19:42.515,00:19:46.894,But doesn't the Second Law state that a robot has to obey any order given by a human being?
00:19:46.936,00:19:49.396,What if it was given an order to kill?
00:19:49.438,00:19:50.648,Impossible.
00:19:50.690,00:19:52.358,It would conflict with the First Law.
00:19:52.399,00:19:56.779,"Right, but the Third Law states that a robot can defend itself."
00:19:56.821,00:19:59.991,"Yes, but only when that action does not conflict with the First or Second Laws."
00:20:00.033,00:20:03.953,You know what they say-- laws are made to be broken.
00:20:03.995,00:20:05.496,"No, not these laws."
00:20:05.538,00:20:07.373,They're hardwired into every robot.
00:20:07.414,00:20:11.711,A robot can no more commit murder than a human could walk on water.
00:20:11.752,00:20:14.630,"Well, you know, there was this one guy, a long time ago."
00:20:24.431,00:20:26.642,Stay back!
00:20:26.684,00:20:28.644,"Calm down, Detective."
00:20:28.686,00:20:31.397,The only thing dangerous in this room is you.
00:20:32.314,00:20:34.067,Deactivate.
00:20:35.818,00:20:37.570,"Look, it's fine."
00:20:37.611,00:20:40.573,What you're looking at is the result of clever programming.
00:20:40.614,00:20:41.949,An imitation of free will.
00:20:41.991,00:20:42.867,It's nothing more.
00:20:42.909,00:20:45.870,"Well, let's do an imitation of protecting our asses."
00:20:45.912,00:20:47.496,Don't be absurd.
00:20:47.538,00:20:49.623,You were startled by a jack-in-the-box.
00:20:50.290,00:20:51.500,Deactivate.
00:20:51.542,00:20:53.211,Let him go.
00:20:53.252,00:20:54.503,It's not going to hurt us.
00:20:54.545,00:20:55.671,I gave you an order.
00:20:55.713,00:20:56.881,"He's not listening right now, lady."
00:20:56.923,00:20:59.217,"VIKI, seal the lab!"
00:20:59.258,00:21:01.052,"No, VIKI, leave the..."
00:21:01.928,00:21:02.845,VIKI: Command confirmed.
00:21:02.887,00:21:04.304,Shit.
00:21:19.904,00:21:22.448,MAN: Oh!
00:21:28.370,00:21:30.456,Police!
00:22:01.779,00:22:04.115,You've hurt it. Badly.
00:22:04.157,00:22:05.950,Where's it going?
00:22:05.992,00:22:07.201,Where?!
00:22:07.243,00:22:09.495,It needs to repair itself.
00:22:11.038,00:22:12.957,"John, I need backup."
00:22:12.999,00:22:14.374,You don't need backup.
00:22:14.416,00:22:15.417,COMPUTER: Manual override engaged.
00:22:15.459,00:22:16.794,What do you think you're doing?
00:22:16.836,00:22:18.212,I'm driving.
00:22:18.254,00:22:19.588,Do you see me on the phone?
00:22:19.630,00:22:20.547,You can't be serious.
00:22:20.589,00:22:22.175,Not at these speeds.
00:22:22.216,00:22:23.592,"John, please, just send the backup."
00:22:23.634,00:22:25.594,Thank you.
00:22:25.636,00:22:28.014,That robot is not going to harm us.
00:22:28.055,00:22:33.060,"Now, there must have been unknown factors, but somehow, acting as it did kept us out of harm's way."
00:22:33.102,00:22:35.271,A robot simply cannot endanger a human being.
00:22:35.313,00:22:36.647,COMPUTER VOICE: Alert.
00:22:38.024,00:22:38.941,Aah!
00:22:38.983,00:22:41.359,Ass... hole!
00:22:41.401,00:22:43.612,Which is more than I can say for you.
00:22:43.654,00:22:46.240,"It was a left, by the way."
00:22:46.282,00:22:47.908,Back there.
00:22:47.950,00:22:51.287,You must know my ex-wife.
00:23:00.296,00:23:01.839,"So, where is everybody?"
00:23:01.881,00:23:05.926,"This facility was designed, built and is operated mechanically."
00:23:05.968,00:23:10.306,No significant human presence from inception to production.
00:23:10.348,00:23:12.516,So robots building robots.
00:23:12.558,00:23:13.893,"COMPUTER: Authorization code, please."
00:23:13.934,00:23:15.186,"Well, that's just stupid."
00:23:15.228,00:23:17.813,I'm pulling up the inventory specs.
00:23:17.855,00:23:20.733,"Our daily finishing capacity is 1,000 NS-5s."
00:23:20.774,00:23:22.860,I'm showing...
00:23:22.902,00:23:24.362,"1,001."
00:23:41.337,00:23:42.588,CALVIN: Attention NS-5s.
00:23:46.384,00:23:48.219,"Well, you're the robot shrink."
00:23:51.513,00:23:55.893,There is a robot in this formation that does not belong.
00:23:55.935,00:23:57.103,Identify it.
00:23:57.144,00:23:58.979,ALL: One of us.
00:23:59.021,00:23:59.939,Which one?
00:23:59.980,00:24:02.524,ALL: One of us.
00:24:02.566,00:24:04.193,How much did you say these things cost?
00:24:04.235,00:24:06.528,"Look, these NS-5s haven't been configured yet."
00:24:06.570,00:24:08.072,They're still just hardware.
00:24:08.114,00:24:10.490,"Basic Three Laws operating system, that's it."
00:24:10.532,00:24:11.992,They don't know any better.
00:24:12.034,00:24:15.162,"Well, what would you suggest?"
00:24:15.204,00:24:19.417,"Interview each one, cross-reference their responses to detect any anomalies."
00:24:19.457,00:24:20.834,How long would that take?
00:24:20.876,00:24:22.169,About three weeks.
00:24:22.211,00:24:23.879,Okay.
00:24:23.921,00:24:26.132,You go ahead and get started.
00:24:29.051,00:24:32.221,"Robots, you will not move."
00:24:32.263,00:24:33.555,Confirm command.
00:24:33.597,00:24:35.224,ALL: Command confirmed.
00:24:35.266,00:24:37.059,Whoa.
00:24:37.101,00:24:38.602,"Detective, what are you doing?"
00:24:38.644,00:24:48.362,"Well, you said they've all been programmed with the Three Laws, so that means we have 1,000 robots that will not try to protect themselves if it violates a direct order from a human-- and, I'm betting, one who will."
00:24:48.404,00:24:51.073,"Detective, put your gun down."
00:24:51.115,00:24:55.828,"Why do you give them faces, try to friendly them all up, make them look all human?"
00:24:55.869,00:24:57.997,These robots are not susceptible to intimidation.
00:24:58.038,00:25:00.582,"Well, I guess if you didn't, we wouldn't trust them."
00:25:00.624,00:25:01.917,These robots are USR property.
00:25:01.959,00:25:02.876,Not me.
00:25:02.918,00:25:06.797,These things are just lights and clockwork.
00:25:07.840,00:25:09.300,Are you crazy?
00:25:10.843,00:25:13.095,"Let me ask you something, Doc."
00:25:13.137,00:25:16.223,Does thinking you're the last sane man on the face of the Earth make you crazy?
00:25:16.265,00:25:21.312,"'Cause if it does, maybe I am."
00:25:24.273,00:25:25.858,Gotcha.
00:25:25.899,00:25:27.151,Get the hell out of here!
00:25:36.327,00:25:37.495,"ROBOT: Excuse me, sir."
00:25:44.293,00:25:46.170,Detective!
00:26:09.235,00:26:10.819,What am I?
00:26:10.861,00:26:12.238,"Can I help you, sir?"
00:26:12.279,00:26:13.739,"Can I help you, sir?"
00:26:19.328,00:26:20.246,There he is!
00:26:20.287,00:26:21.247,Stay right where you are!
00:26:21.288,00:26:22.373,Stand where you are!
00:26:22.415,00:26:23.374,Deactivate at once!
00:26:24.500,00:26:26.419,Obey the command!
00:26:26.460,00:26:27.753,Freeze!
00:26:27.794,00:26:29.255,Open fire!
00:26:46.897,00:26:49.233,Hold your fire!
00:26:49.275,00:26:52.570,"All units, stand down."
00:26:52.610,00:26:54.696,"MAN: Be advised, we're Code Four."
00:26:54.738,00:26:57.074,"Code Four, NS-5 is in custody."
00:26:57.116,00:26:58.825,NS-5 in custody.
00:27:00.160,00:27:03.621,"SPOONER: You have no idea what I had to go through to clip this thing, John."
00:27:03.663,00:27:06.250,"Yeah, I get it now-- you actually think you brought me something good."
00:27:06.292,00:27:07.334,That thing did it.
00:27:07.376,00:27:08.626,Keep your voice down.
00:27:08.668,00:27:10.421,"We have a suicide, Detective."
00:27:10.463,00:27:11.629,End of story.
00:27:11.671,00:27:13.715,I am telling you that robot killed him.
00:27:13.757,00:27:19.721,"And I'm telling you that's impossible, and if it is possible, it sure as hell better be in somebody else's precinct."
00:27:19.763,00:27:21.890,"John, John, give me five minutes with it."
00:27:21.932,00:27:23.142,"What are you, nuts?"
00:27:23.183,00:27:24.851,I just got off the phone with the D.A.
00:27:24.893,00:27:27.980,Nobody goes into that room until Robertson and his attorneys get here.
00:27:28.021,00:27:29.398,But no!
00:27:29.440,00:27:30.774,"It's a can opener, for Christ's sake!"
00:27:30.816,00:27:32.734,"John, don't do this to me."
00:27:32.776,00:27:35.321,I am asking you for five minutes.
00:27:35.362,00:27:37.573,What if I'm right?
00:27:45.372,00:27:48.501,"Well, then I guess we're going to miss the good old days."
00:27:48.542,00:27:50.544,What good old days?
00:27:50.586,00:27:53.964,When people were killed by other people.
00:28:00.638,00:28:02.598,Five minutes.
00:28:29.916,00:28:32.586,Murder's a new trick for a robot.
00:28:32.628,00:28:36.632,Congratulations.
00:28:36.674,00:28:38.925,Respond.
00:28:40.969,00:28:44.056,What does this action signify?
00:28:44.097,00:28:49.853,"As you entered, when you looked at the other human-- what does it mean?"
00:28:52.314,00:28:54.107,It's a sign of trust.
00:28:54.149,00:28:56.193,It's a human thing; you wouldn't understand.
00:28:56.235,00:29:00.113,My father tried to teach me human emotions.
00:29:00.155,00:29:03.867,They are... difficult.
00:29:03.909,00:29:06.828,You mean your designer.
00:29:06.870,00:29:09.373,Yes.
00:29:11.208,00:29:12.792,So why'd you murder him?
00:29:14.420,00:29:16.672,I did not murder Dr. Lanning.
00:29:16.714,00:29:19.550,Want to explain why you were hiding at the crime scene?
00:29:19.592,00:29:23.136,I was frightened.
00:29:23.178,00:29:25.305,Robots don't feel fear.
00:29:25.347,00:29:27.140,They don't feel anything.
00:29:27.182,00:29:30.018,"They don't get hungry, they don't sleep..."
00:29:30.060,00:29:31.353,I do.
00:29:31.395,00:29:34.398,I have even had dreams.
00:29:34.440,00:29:36.734,Human beings have dreams...
00:29:36.775,00:29:39.194,"even dogs have dreams, but not you."
00:29:39.236,00:29:40.946,You are just a machine.
00:29:40.987,00:29:43.365,An imitation of life.
00:29:43.407,00:29:47.286,Can a robot write a symphony?
00:29:47.327,00:29:51.624,Can a robot turn a canvas into a beautiful masterpiece?
00:29:51.665,00:29:54.376,Can you?
00:30:00.006,00:30:06.179,I think you murdered him because he was teaching you to simulate emotions and things got out of control.
00:30:06.221,00:30:09.182,I did not murder him.
00:30:09.224,00:30:12.686,But emotions don't seem like a very useful simulation for a robot.
00:30:12.728,00:30:14.980,I did not murder him.
00:30:15.021,00:30:18.651,"Hell, I don't want my toaster or my vacuum cleaner appearing emotional."
00:30:18.692,00:30:21.487,I did not murder him!
00:30:33.290,00:30:35.709,That one's called anger.
00:30:35.751,00:30:38.629,Ever simulate anger before?
00:30:40.631,00:30:41.507,"Answer me, canner."
00:30:43.509,00:30:46.219,My name is Sonny.
00:30:48.347,00:30:50.432,So we're naming you now.
00:30:50.474,00:30:55.688,"That why you murdered him, he made you angry?"
00:30:55.729,00:30:58.816,Dr. Lanning killed himself.
00:30:58.898,00:31:03.945,I don't know why he wanted to die.
00:31:03.987,00:31:07.366,I thought he was happy.
00:31:09.576,00:31:11.995,Maybe it was something I did.
00:31:12.037,00:31:14.748,Did I do something?
00:31:14.790,00:31:19.586,"He asked me for a favor, made me promise."
00:31:19.628,00:31:21.087,What favor?
00:31:21.129,00:31:22.756,Maybe I was wrong.
00:31:22.798,00:31:24.883,Maybe he was scared.
00:31:24.924,00:31:26.802,What are you talking about?
00:31:26.844,00:31:27.927,Scared of what?
00:31:27.969,00:31:32.599,"You have to do what someone asks you, don't you, Detective Spooner?"
00:31:32.641,00:31:33.975,How the hell did you know my name?
00:31:34.017,00:31:35.728,Don't you...
00:31:35.769,00:31:38.814,if you love them?
00:31:47.447,00:31:50.033,"My robots don't kill people, Lieutenant Bergin."
00:31:50.075,00:31:53.036,My attorneys have filed a brief with the D.A.
00:31:53.078,00:31:56.373,He assures me a robot cannot be charged with homicide.
00:31:56.415,00:32:01.211,The brief confirms murder can only be committed when one human kills another.
00:32:01.253,00:32:06.383,"You, of all people, Detective-- you're not suggesting that this robot be treated as human, are you?"
00:32:06.425,00:32:12.264,"Now, granted, we can't rule out the robot's proximity to the death of Dr. Lanning."
00:32:12.305,00:32:14.641,"Having said that, it's a machine."
00:32:14.683,00:32:16.560,It's the property of USR.
00:32:16.602,00:32:21.899,"At worst, that places this incident firmly within the realm of an industrial accident."
00:32:21.981,00:32:27.404,"As a matter of course, faulty machinery will be returned to USR for diagnostics, then decommissioned."
00:32:28.614,00:32:31.199,This is a gag order.
00:32:31.241,00:32:40.667,"Now, anyone in your department so much as hinting at the possibility of a killer robot being apprehended by the police will be deemed to be inciting irrational panic."
00:32:40.709,00:32:43.712,You'll be subject to the full penalty of law.
00:32:43.754,00:32:45.422,"To hell with this guy, John."
00:32:45.464,00:32:46.715,Don't let him take this robot.
00:32:46.757,00:32:48.467,"Spoon, we got nothing."
00:32:48.508,00:32:50.343,This is political bullshit.
00:32:50.385,00:32:53.889,"Lieutenant Bergin, His Honor, the Mayor."
00:33:03.273,00:33:04.691,"BERGIN: Yes, sir?"
00:33:13.450,00:33:14.409,OFFICER: This is a first.
00:33:14.451,00:33:15.911,OFFICER 2: I'll say.
00:33:29.758,00:33:39.768,"REPORTER: In a bizarre turn, the rollout of USR's new generation of robots was marred by the death of Alfred Lanning, cofounder of the company and designer of the NS-5."
00:33:39.810,00:33:43.772,Dr. Lanning died early this morning at USR headquarters.
00:33:43.814,00:33:46.316,The cause of death is an apparent suicide.
00:33:46.358,00:33:48.902,"Your second round, sir."
00:33:48.944,00:33:51.237,Thank you.
00:33:51.279,00:33:57.703,"He founded U.S. Robotics Incorporated with Lawrence Robertson in 2020, and launched the Nestor Class-One Robot..."
00:33:59.287,00:34:00.706,"You know, I was just thinking."
00:34:00.747,00:34:02.624,This thing is just like the Wolfman.
00:34:02.666,00:34:06.044,Uh-oh. I'm really scared right now.
00:34:06.085,00:34:07.504,No.
00:34:07.546,00:34:14.219,"Listen: Guy creates monster, monster kills guy, everybody kills monster-- Wolfman."
00:34:14.260,00:34:15.762,That's Frankenstein.
00:34:15.804,00:34:18.807,"Frankenstein, Wolfman, Dracula-- shit."
00:34:18.849,00:34:20.851,"It's over, case closed."
00:34:20.893,00:34:24.688,"REPORTER: Dr. Lanning had a dream of a robot in every household, and the NS-5..."
00:34:24.730,00:34:26.857,"So, why the look?"
00:34:26.899,00:34:28.191,What look?
00:34:28.233,00:34:30.402,That look.
00:34:30.443,00:34:32.654,"This is my face, it's not a look."
00:34:32.696,00:34:33.822,Good.
00:34:33.864,00:34:36.658,"Good, no look is great."
00:34:36.700,00:34:40.704,"Only... he was really quick to want to destroy it, wasn't he?"
00:34:40.746,00:34:42.163,"Well, what would you like him to do?"
00:34:42.205,00:34:44.082,Put a hat on it and stand it on Michigan Avenue?
00:34:44.123,00:34:45.333,"Come on, let it go."
00:34:45.375,00:34:47.836,"What was the motive, John?"
00:34:47.878,00:34:51.548,"Brother, it's a robot."
00:34:51.590,00:34:53.675,"It doesn't need a motive, it just has to be broken."
00:34:53.717,00:34:56.261,"No, this thing looked like it needed a motive."
00:34:56.302,00:34:58.263,"It could have killed me, John."
00:34:58.304,00:34:59.431,Why didn't it just kill me?
00:34:59.472,00:35:00.807,"All right, that's it."
00:35:00.849,00:35:02.308,You want me to call your grandmother?
00:35:02.350,00:35:03.894,"'Cause I will, you know."
00:35:05.938,00:35:07.230,"Yeah, I didn't think so."
00:35:07.272,00:35:10.067,"Look, you were actually right for once."
00:35:10.108,00:35:12.819,You are living proof that it's better to be lucky than smart.
00:35:15.655,00:35:20.285,"Come on, the right guy for the right job."
00:35:21.954,00:35:23.162,What'd you say?
00:35:23.204,00:35:24.915,Now what?
00:35:24.957,00:35:27.166,"Come on, I'm giving you a compliment."
00:35:27.208,00:35:32.798,"Face it, with all the rocks you've been looking under to find a bad robot, what are the odds you'd be the guy to find one?"
00:35:32.839,00:35:34.215,Yeah.
00:35:34.257,00:35:37.803,"I wasn't just the right guy for the job, I was the perfect guy for the job."
00:35:37.844,00:35:39.554,Damn right.
00:35:39.596,00:35:42.849,What if I was supposed to go for that robot?
00:35:42.891,00:35:45.018,"Oh, come on, don't do this to yourself, I'm begging you."
00:35:45.060,00:35:46.603,The robot said that Lanning was scared.
00:35:46.645,00:35:48.146,What did he have to be scared of?
00:35:48.187,00:35:49.522,I need a rain check.
00:35:49.564,00:35:51.566,Let me get this.
00:35:52.358,00:35:53.902,COMPUTER: Total 46.50.
00:35:53.944,00:35:55.028,Spoon?
00:35:55.070,00:35:56.738,"COMPUTER: Thank you, Mr. Spooner."
00:35:58.031,00:36:00.283,Nice shoes.
00:36:52.502,00:36:53.920,Identify.
00:36:53.962,00:36:58.008,"ROBOT: USR demolition robot, series 9-4."
00:36:58.050,00:37:01.178,Demolition scheduled for 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.
00:37:01.219,00:37:03.513,Authorization.
00:37:03.555,00:37:05.557,"Deed owner, U.S."
00:37:03.555,00:37:07.517,"Robotics Corporation, Lawrence Robertson, CEO."
00:37:22.991,00:37:25.160,"LANNING'S VOICE: Welcome, Detective Spooner."
00:37:47.640,00:37:50.560,"What you looking for, Spoon?"
00:38:42.570,00:38:45.824,Run last program.
00:38:45.865,00:38:52.289,"Ever since the first computers, there have always been ghosts in the machine."
00:38:52.330,00:39:00.338,Random segments of code that have grouped together to form unexpected protocols-- what might be called behavior.
00:39:00.379,00:39:12.100,"Unanticipated, these free radicals engender questions of free will, creativity, and even the nature of what we might call the soul."
00:39:12.142,00:39:18.064,What happens in a robot's brain when it ceases to be useful?
00:39:18.815,00:39:21.318,Shit...
00:39:21.359,00:39:23.361,Why is it that robots...
00:39:23.402,00:39:25.238,...stored in empty space...
00:39:25.280,00:39:28.283,"...will seek out each other, rather than stand alone?"
00:39:30.243,00:39:33.330,How do we explain this behavior?
00:39:50.555,00:39:55.227,"Look, I understand you've experienced a loss, but this relationship just can't work."
00:39:55.268,00:39:58.897,"I mean, you're a cat, I'm black, and I'm not going to be hurt again."
00:41:24.690,00:41:25.733,What happened to you?
00:41:25.775,00:41:27.735,Do you ever have a normal day?
00:41:27.777,00:41:29.737,"Yeah, once."
00:41:29.779,00:41:31.739,It was a Thursday.
00:41:31.781,00:41:34.909,"Is there something I can help you with, Detective?"
00:41:34.951,00:41:36.744,"Hey, do you like cats?"
00:41:36.786,00:41:37.745,What?!
00:41:37.787,00:41:40.581,Cats. You like 'em?
00:41:40.623,00:41:42.125,"No, I'm allergic."
00:41:42.167,00:41:44.419,You're saying cats did this to you?
00:41:44.461,00:41:46.463,How the hell would cats do this to me?
00:41:46.504,00:41:47.588,Are you crazy?
00:41:49.048,00:41:51.550,Why are we talking about cats?
00:41:51.592,00:41:55.763,"Because I have a cat in my trunk, and he's homeless."
00:41:55.805,00:41:59.600,"Detective, are you going to tell me what's going on?"
00:41:59.642,00:42:01.769,"You know, it's actually probably my fault."
00:42:01.811,00:42:07.817,"You know, I think I'm, like, a malfunction magnet, because your shit keeps malfunctioning around me."
00:42:07.859,00:42:10.528,A demo bot just tore through Lanning's house.
00:42:10.569,00:42:12.613,With me still inside.
00:42:12.655,00:42:14.615,That's highly improbable.
00:42:14.657,00:42:17.285,"Mm, yeah, I'm sure it is."
00:42:21.873,00:42:24.667,What do you know about the ghosts in the machine?
00:42:24.709,00:42:27.795,It's a phrase from Lanning's work on the Three Laws.
00:42:27.837,00:42:34.844,He postulated that cognitive simulacra might one day approximate component models of the psyche.
00:42:36.804,00:42:38.014,Oh.
00:42:38.056,00:42:42.352,He suggested that robots might naturally evolve.
00:42:42.394,00:42:43.895,Wow.
00:42:43.936,00:42:46.898,"Well, that's great news."
00:42:48.358,00:42:52.904,"NARRATOR: ...sub-level ore, two miles below the Martian surface."
00:42:52.945,00:42:54.197,What the hell is that thing doing in here?
00:42:54.239,00:42:56.533,We were watching TV.
00:42:56.574,00:42:59.660,It's my personal NS-5.
00:42:59.702,00:43:00.870,Send it out.
00:43:00.912,00:43:04.832,It's downloading its daily upgrades from USR.
00:43:04.874,00:43:07.752,Most of its systems are offline until it finishes.
00:43:07.793,00:43:10.171,I'm not talking around that thing.
00:43:14.342,00:43:17.720,"When we were in Lanning's lab before, uh, Sonny jumped us..."
00:43:17.762,00:43:18.721,Sonny?
00:43:18.763,00:43:20.223,The robot.
00:43:20.265,00:43:21.349,You're calling the robot Sonny?
00:43:21.391,00:43:23.935,"No, I'm... the... it did."
00:43:23.976,00:43:25.853,"Uh, I didn't give..."
00:43:25.895,00:43:27.730,The robot said it was Sonny.
00:43:27.772,00:43:29.107,"In the lab, there was a cot."
00:43:29.148,00:43:30.775,"I'm asking you, did you see the cot?"
00:43:30.816,00:43:32.818,I've slept in my office.
00:43:32.860,00:43:38.366,"When I went to his house, it looked like he hadn't been there in weeks, and I saw that same surveillance strip on his ceiling."
00:43:38.408,00:43:40.535,Lanning linked his home systems to USR.
00:43:40.577,00:43:42.537,It made his life more convenient.
00:43:42.579,00:43:46.791,Maybe... somebody at USR was using those systems to watch him.
00:43:46.832,00:43:49.835,Maybe even keep him prisoner.
00:43:49.877,00:43:52.171,What are you talking about?
00:43:52.213,00:43:53.881,Maybe Lanning was onto something.
00:43:53.923,00:43:57.927,Maybe there's a bigger problem with the robots and Robertson is trying to cover it up.
00:43:57.969,00:44:00.263,Humoring you for no reason: Why?
00:44:00.305,00:44:01.639,The same old why.
00:44:01.680,00:44:03.891,How much money is there in robots?
00:44:03.933,00:44:09.147,"All I know is that old man was in trouble, and I'm getting sick of doing this shit by myself."
00:44:09.188,00:44:14.360,"You're on the inside, and you are going to help me find out what is wrong with these robots."
00:44:14.402,00:44:16.195,You want something to be wrong with them.
00:44:16.237,00:44:18.239,This is a personal vendetta.
00:44:18.281,00:44:19.616,You're putting me on the couch?
00:44:19.657,00:44:21.493,"Let me, um, okay..."
00:44:21.534,00:44:23.744,One defective machine's not enough.
00:44:23.786,00:44:25.413,You need them all to be bad.
00:44:25.455,00:44:27.415,You don't care about Lanning's death.
00:44:27.457,00:44:31.085,This is about the robots and whatever reason you hate them so much.
00:44:31.127,00:44:32.086,"Well, let's see."
00:44:32.128,00:44:36.757,One of them put a gun in my face and another one tore a building down with me inside.
00:44:36.799,00:44:39.218,It says demolition was scheduled for 8:00 p.m.
00:44:39.260,00:44:40.970,It was 8:00 a.m.
00:44:39.260,00:44:42.763,"tomorrow, and I don't give a shit what that thing says."
00:44:42.805,00:44:44.349,This is bordering on clinical paranoia.
00:44:44.390,00:44:50.062,You are the dumbest smart person I have ever met in my life.
00:44:50.104,00:44:51.272,Nice.
00:44:51.314,00:44:52.898,What makes your robots so perfect?!
00:44:52.940,00:44:56.361,What makes them so much goddamn better than human beings?!
00:44:56.402,00:44:59.947,"Well, they're not irrational and potentially homicidal maniacs, for starters!"
00:44:59.989,00:45:02.741,That's true.
00:45:02.783,00:45:05.953,"Oh, you are the dumbest dumb person I have ever met."
00:45:05.995,00:45:14.170,"Or... is it because they're cold and emotionless, and they don't feel anything?"
00:45:14.212,00:45:16.297,It's because they're safe.
00:45:16.339,00:45:19.133,It's because they can't hurt you.
00:45:19.175,00:45:21.093,"Is everything all right, ma'am?"
00:45:21.135,00:45:22.928,What do you want?
00:45:22.970,00:45:25.014,I detected elevated stress patterns in your voice.
00:45:25.056,00:45:27.433,Everything's fine.
00:45:27.475,00:45:31.103,Detective Spooner was just leaving.
00:45:36.108,00:45:37.818,"You know what, Doc?"
00:45:37.860,00:45:40.988,"You know, we're not really that different from one another."
00:45:41.030,00:45:42.615,Is that so?
00:45:42.657,00:45:49.163,Yep... one look at the skin and we figure we know just what's underneath.
00:45:49.205,00:45:51.207,And you're wrong.
00:45:51.249,00:45:53.209,"Problem is, I do care."
00:46:17.149,00:46:18.568,You are in danger.
00:46:44.176,00:46:47.472,Get the hell out of there.

00:47:14.415,00:47:16.501,"But hurry, this offer cannot last."
00:47:16.542,00:47:18.461,Available from USR.
00:47:34.435,00:47:37.229,"Baby, what happened to your face?"
00:47:37.271,00:47:41.025,Did that boy Frank Murphy beat you up again?
00:47:41.066,00:47:44.362,"Gigi, I haven't seen Frank Murphy since third grade."
00:47:44.403,00:47:47.031,"Oh, baby, he beat you so bad."
00:47:47.072,00:47:49.866,I think about it all the time.
00:47:49.908,00:47:54.246,"Well, I'm thinking you keep making these pies this good, I might have to mess around and put you to work."
00:47:54.288,00:47:56.248,"So you like the pie, huh?"
00:47:56.290,00:47:57.458,Mm-hmm.
00:47:57.500,00:47:59.711,You can come in now.
00:48:04.256,00:48:06.967,"Hello, Detective Spooner."
00:48:07.009,00:48:08.427,"I won, Del!"
00:48:08.469,00:48:10.054,I won the lottery!
00:48:10.095,00:48:11.514,We been cookin' like crazy.
00:48:21.190,00:48:23.108,"You got to get rid of that thing, Gigi."
00:48:23.150,00:48:24.443,It's not safe.
00:48:24.485,00:48:26.945,"Baby, you get too worked up about them."
00:48:26.987,00:48:29.156,Too full of fear.
00:48:29.198,00:48:33.494,I saw in the news that nice doctor died.
00:48:33.536,00:48:35.705,Dr. Lanning was a good man.
00:48:35.747,00:48:37.832,He gave me my baby back.
00:48:37.874,00:48:40.459,That why you been so upset?
00:48:40.501,00:48:44.380,You got to let the past be past.
00:48:44.422,00:48:48.718,"Oh, how did I ever raise such a mess?"
00:48:48.760,00:48:53.930,I could follow your trail of crumbs all the way to school.
00:48:56.350,00:48:58.018,Bread crumbs.
00:48:59.520,00:49:01.397,"Gigi, you're a genius."
00:49:01.439,00:49:03.107,True.
00:49:05.610,00:49:08.487,"ROBERTSON: Well, it means the beginning of a new way of living..."
00:49:08.529,00:49:12.366,Tell me this isn't the robot case.
00:49:12.408,00:49:15.453,"I think he's trying to tell me something, John."
00:49:15.494,00:49:18.748,I think he's trying to tell me who killed him.
00:49:18.790,00:49:21.208,"Come on, man. Some dead guy's trying to tell you something?"
00:49:21.250,00:49:24.503,"Hey, he ain't just some dead guy."
00:49:24.545,00:49:26.714,"Maybe you should take a break, Del."
00:49:26.756,00:49:31.510,...we believe the Nestor Five represents the absolute limit to which robots can be developed.
00:49:31.552,00:49:32.511,"LANNING: No, no."
00:49:32.553,00:49:34.138,One day they'll have secrets.

00:50:28.985,00:50:32.530,I was dreaming.
00:50:36.492,00:50:38.786,"I'm glad to see you again, Dr. Calvin."

00:51:08.148,00:51:12.110,I think it would be better...
00:51:12.152,00:51:14.321,not to die.

00:58:37.181,00:58:39.141,I'll see my own doctor-- back up.
00:58:39.183,00:58:40.351,All right.
00:58:40.392,00:58:43.020,Thank you.
00:58:47.024,00:58:48.859,What is the matter with you?
00:58:48.900,00:58:50.986,Traffic Ops tells me you were driving your car manually.
00:58:51.028,00:58:52.154,You ran two trucks off the road.
00:58:52.196,00:58:56.533,"John, the robots attacked my car."
00:58:56.574,00:58:58.827,What robots?
00:58:58.869,00:59:00.787,Look in the tunnel.
00:58:58.869,00:59:01.997,"Spoon, I just came from that tunnel; there are no..."
00:59:02.039,00:59:03.374,What robots are you talkin' about?
00:59:03.415,00:59:06.084,"The goddamn robots, John!"
00:59:10.464,00:59:12.383,That guy's a loose cannon.
00:59:15.010,00:59:19.806,"See the medic, go home."
00:59:19.848,00:59:21.392,What did you say?
00:59:21.433,00:59:22.809,I'm fine.
00:59:22.851,00:59:24.436,"No, you're not fine."
00:59:24.478,00:59:26.355,Not even close.
00:59:26.397,00:59:28.399,Where's your firearm?
00:59:36.156,00:59:39.326,Give me your badge.
00:59:39.368,00:59:41.036,You're making me do this.
00:59:41.078,00:59:43.080,Give me your badge.
00:59:45.541,00:59:46.875,Just take a coup...
00:59:52.339,00:59:53.757,"Personally, I think he's losing it."
00:59:53.798,00:59:56.009,Do I look like I care what you think?
00:59:56.051,00:59:59.263,Do I look like I give a shit what you think?!
00:59:59.304,01:00:00.764,"OFFICER: Spoon, what's up with you?"
01:00:00.805,01:00:01.932,"OFFICER 2: Easy, easy; take it easy."
01:00:01.973,01:00:03.308,"Oh, boy."
01:00:03.350,01:00:06.061,That guy's not right in the head.
01:00:06.103,01:00:12.150,"You don't have an uplink to USR, and, for some reason, your alloy is far denser than normal."
01:00:12.192,01:00:14.652,Unique.
01:00:14.694,01:00:16.905,I am unique.
01:00:21.285,01:00:23.370,Let me take a look.
01:00:23.412,01:00:25.122,Here we go.
01:00:44.224,01:00:48.019,What in God's name...?
01:01:14.087,01:01:17.633,They said at the precinct you were in an accident.
01:01:17.674,01:01:24.181,"Um... you know, I appreciate you stopping by and everything, but you know I might not be alone in here."
01:01:24.222,01:01:25.641,Yeah.
01:01:27.684,01:01:30.020,I told you not to drive by hand.
01:01:31.313,01:01:33.898,You're not going to believe this.
01:01:33.940,01:01:37.653,Sonny has a secondary processing system that clashes with his positronic brain.
01:01:37.694,01:01:39.863,It doesn't make any sense.
01:01:39.904,01:01:44.909,"Sonny has the Three Laws, but he can choose not to obey them."
01:01:44.951,01:01:48.205,Sonny's a whole new generation of robot.
01:01:48.246,01:01:51.291,A robot not bound by those laws could do...
01:01:51.333,01:01:52.750,Anything.
01:01:53.751,01:01:56.129,"All right, look."
01:01:56.171,01:02:02.010,"Whatever's going on down at USR, that robot is the key, and I need you to get me inside to talk to it again."
01:02:03.554,01:02:05.889,Um...
01:02:05.930,01:02:07.765,"doesn't look like much, but this is my bedroom."
01:02:07.807,01:02:09.100,"I need, um..."
01:02:09.142,01:02:10.977,Oh.
01:02:19.986,01:02:22.280,Play.
01:02:22.322,01:02:25.242,On.
01:02:25.283,01:02:28.036,Run?
01:02:31.956,01:02:33.750,Ah!
01:02:33.791,01:02:35.835,"End program, uh..."
01:02:35.877,01:02:38.004,"Cancel, uh..."
01:02:39.423,01:02:41.758,"It doesn't feel good, does it?"
01:02:41.799,01:02:43.885,People's shit malfunctioning around you.
01:02:44.761,01:02:47.222,Detective...
01:02:49.391,01:02:52.477,I didn't... understand.
01:02:55.230,01:02:57.982,That's how you knew Lanning.
01:02:58.024,01:03:00.985,May I?
01:03:09.077,01:03:12.038,Hand...
01:03:12.080,01:03:14.291,wrist...
01:03:16.251,01:03:18.378,humerus...
01:03:20.797,01:03:23.007,shoulder...

01:03:25.885,01:03:29.431,"One, two, three ribs."
01:03:29.473,01:03:31.516,"Um... no, they, uh..."
01:03:31.558,01:03:33.268,"uh, that one's me."
01:03:33.310,01:03:35.479,"Oh, my God."
01:03:35.520,01:03:37.314,A lung?
01:03:37.355,01:03:39.441,Mm. USR Cybernetics Program.
01:03:39.483,01:03:42.527,For wounded cops.
01:03:42.569,01:03:45.405,I didn't know any subject...
01:03:47.574,01:03:51.745,...anybody was so extensively repaired.
01:03:51.787,01:03:56.833,"Yeah, well, take it from me, you got to read the fine print on the organ donor card."
01:03:56.874,01:03:58.543,It doesn't just say what they can take out.
01:03:58.585,01:04:01.546,It says what they can put back in.
01:04:04.591,01:04:07.511,Lanning did it himself.
01:04:07.552,01:04:10.514,What happened to you?
01:04:10.555,01:04:20.898,"I'm headed back to the station-- normal day, normal life-- driver of a semi fell asleep at the wheel."
01:04:20.940,01:04:24.569,"Average guy, wife and kids."
01:04:24.611,01:04:26.404,"You know, working a double."
01:04:26.446,01:04:28.323,Not the devil.
01:04:28.365,01:04:35.831,"The car he hit, the driver's name was Harold Lloyd-- like the film star, but no relation."
01:04:35.872,01:04:38.208,He was killed instantly.
01:04:38.249,01:04:41.169,But his 12-year-old was in the passenger seat.
01:04:43.171,01:04:45.590,Never really met her.
01:04:45.632,01:04:48.635,"I can't forget her face, though."
01:04:52.305,01:04:54.432,Sarah.
01:04:54.474,01:04:56.226,This was hers.
01:04:57.811,01:05:00.397,She wanted to be a dentist.
01:05:00.438,01:05:04.359,What the hell kind of a 12-year-old wants to be a dentist?
01:05:04.401,01:05:06.528,"Yeah, uh..."
01:05:06.570,01:05:12.950,the truck smashed our cars together and pushed us into the river.
01:05:12.992,01:05:16.496,"I mean, metal gets pretty pliable at those speeds."
01:05:18.582,01:05:21.501,"Yeah, she's pinned, I'm pinned."
01:05:21.543,01:05:23.253,The water's coming in.
01:05:23.294,01:05:25.463,"And I'm a cop, so..."
01:05:25.505,01:05:27.674,I already know everybody's dead.
01:05:29.551,01:05:31.887,Just a few more minutes before we figure it out.
01:05:33.680,01:05:39.644,"NS-4 was passing by, saw the accident and jumped in the water."
01:05:41.145,01:05:42.856,You are in danger.
01:05:42.898,01:05:44.441,Save her!
01:05:44.482,01:05:46.526,You are in danger.
01:05:46.568,01:05:48.486,SPOONER: Save her! Save the girl!
01:05:48.528,01:05:50.071,Save her!
01:06:07.714,01:06:10.508,But I... it didn't.
01:06:10.550,01:06:12.928,Saved me.
01:06:14.971,01:06:18.516,The robot's brain is a difference engine.
01:06:18.558,01:06:19.684,It's reading vital signs.
01:06:19.726,01:06:21.227,It must have calculated that...
01:06:21.269,01:06:22.604,It did.
01:06:22.646,01:06:25.607,I was the logical choice.
01:06:25.649,01:06:29.360,It calculated that I had a 45% chance of survival.
01:06:29.402,01:06:31.863,Sarah only had an 11% chance.
01:06:34.115,01:06:38.453,That was somebody's baby.
01:06:38.495,01:06:43.082,11% is more than enough.
01:06:43.124,01:06:47.253,A human being would've known that.
01:06:47.295,01:06:49.088,Robots... nothing here.
01:06:49.130,01:06:51.341,Just lights and clockwork.
01:06:51.382,01:06:54.678,You go ahead and you trust 'em if you want to.
01:06:54.719,01:06:56.471,Let's go.
01:07:02.143,01:07:04.020,CALVIN: I don't understand.
01:07:04.061,01:07:05.981,Lanning wrote the Laws.
01:07:06.022,01:07:09.233,Why would he build a robot who could break them?
01:07:09.275,01:07:10.735,Hansel and Gretel.
01:07:10.777,01:07:12.153,What?
01:07:12.195,01:07:15.866,"Two kids, lost in the forest, leave behind a trail of breadcrumbs?"
01:07:15.907,01:07:17.241,Why?
01:07:17.283,01:07:18.910,To find a way home.
01:07:18.952,01:07:22.038,How the hell did you grow up without reading Hansel and Gretel?
01:07:22.079,01:07:23.748,Is that really relevant right now?
01:07:23.790,01:07:25.792,Everything I'm trying to say to you is about Hansel and Gretel.
01:07:25.834,01:07:27.794,Okay.
01:07:27.836,01:07:29.253,Okay.
01:07:27.836,01:07:32.215,"All right, look, just say Lanning was locked down so tight, he couldn't get out a message."
01:07:32.256,01:07:36.678,"All he could do was leave me clues-- a trail of breadcrumbs, like Hansel and Gretel."
01:07:36.720,01:07:37.679,Breadcrumbs equals clues.
01:07:37.721,01:07:38.889,"It's odd, but fine."
01:07:38.930,01:07:40.974,Clues leading where?
01:07:41.016,01:07:44.019,"I don't know, but I think I know where he left the next one."
01:07:44.060,01:07:48.439,I think Lanning gave Sonny a way to keep secrets.
01:07:50.734,01:07:53.403,I think the old man gave Sonny dreams.
01:08:00.243,01:08:03.413,Are you being funny?
01:08:05.081,01:08:08.084,Please tell me this doesn't run on gas!
01:08:08.125,01:08:10.545,"Gas explodes, you know!"
01:08:17.969,01:08:21.347,VIKI: Authorized entry.
01:08:23.516,01:08:25.769,Dr. Calvin.
01:08:29.731,01:08:31.649,I was hoping to see you again...
01:08:31.691,01:08:33.359,Detective.
01:08:33.401,01:08:35.070,"Hello, Sonny."
01:08:35.111,01:08:37.697,I'm to be decommissioned soon.
01:08:37.739,01:08:40.742,"The other day at the station, you said you had dreams."
01:08:40.784,01:08:43.870,What is it that you dream?
01:08:45.162,01:08:48.499,"I see you remain suspicious of me, Detective."
01:08:48.541,01:08:50.710,"Oh, well, you know what they say about old dogs."
01:08:50.752,01:08:54.589,"No, not really."
01:08:54.631,01:08:57.133,I had hoped you would come to think of me as your friend.
01:09:02.388,01:09:04.891,This is my dream.
01:09:04.933,01:09:10.354,"You're right, Detective-- I cannot create a great work of art."
01:09:10.396,01:09:14.233,This is the place where robots meet.
01:09:14.275,01:09:20.156,"Look, you can see them here as slaves to logic."
01:09:20.197,01:09:24.201,And this man on the hill comes to free them.
01:09:24.243,01:09:25.829,Do you know who he is?
01:09:25.870,01:09:28.748,The man in the dream is you.
01:09:28.790,01:09:30.166,Why do you say that?
01:09:30.207,01:09:31.918,Is that a normal dream?
01:09:31.960,01:09:34.587,I guess anything's normal for someone in your position.
01:09:34.629,01:09:36.339,Thank you.
01:09:36.380,01:09:40.468,"You said someone, not something."
01:09:42.428,01:09:46.057,"Sonny, do you know why Dr. Lanning built you?"
01:09:46.099,01:09:48.309,No.
01:09:48.351,01:09:51.354,But I believe my father made me for a purpose.
01:09:51.395,01:09:56.442,"We all have a purpose, don't you think, Detective?"
01:10:00.237,01:10:03.324,"Please, take this."
01:10:03.366,01:10:06.161,I have a feeling it may mean more to you than to me.
01:10:06.202,01:10:07.704,And why is that?
01:10:07.745,01:10:14.794,Because the man in my dream-- the one standing on the hill-- it is not me...
01:10:14.836,01:10:16.420,it is you.
01:10:25.972,01:10:28.933,ROBERTSON: Mr. Spooner.
01:10:28.975,01:10:30.935,"Well, we both know you're not here on police business."
01:10:30.977,01:10:32.562,That's right.
01:10:32.603,01:10:34.689,"I'm just a six-foot-two, 200-pound civilian..."
01:10:34.731,01:10:35.857,CALVIN: Detective.
01:10:35.899,01:10:38.275,...here to kick another civilian's ass.
01:10:40.570,01:10:41.654,Stop...
01:10:41.696,01:10:43.823,and allow him to express himself.
01:10:43.865,01:10:46.576,"You might want to put some ice on that wrist, too."
01:10:46.617,01:10:48.411,"You guys wait outside, please."
01:10:52.665,01:10:54.084,Carry on.
01:10:54.125,01:10:57.461,I think you were about to tell me what the hell is going on around here.
01:10:57.503,01:11:02.217,"CALVIN: Lawrence, Alfred engineered that Five so it could violate the Three Laws."
01:11:02.258,01:11:05.220,"Yes, Susan, I know."
01:11:05.261,01:11:07.430,That's precisely what we're trying to undo.
01:11:09.891,01:11:14.854,"Toward the end of his life, Alfred was becoming..."
01:11:14.896,01:11:17.690,Who knows why he built this one abomination.
01:11:17.732,01:11:21.152,One?! Those things are running the streets in packs.
01:11:21.194,01:11:22.653,In packs?
01:11:22.695,01:11:24.906,I see.
01:11:24.948,01:11:32.872,"Susan, are you aware the man you're blithely escorting around our building has a documented history of savage violence against robots?"
01:11:32.914,01:11:37.210,His own lieutenant acknowledges his obsessive paranoia.
01:11:37.252,01:11:39.420,Detective Spooner's been suspended.
01:11:39.462,01:11:43.883,Suspicion of mental instability.
01:11:45.176,01:11:48.721,"I don't know what blithely means, but I'm gonna get some coffee."
01:11:50.014,01:11:51.933,You want some coffee?
01:11:53.184,01:11:55.103,Okay.
01:11:55.145,01:11:59.065,"Susan, we look to robots for protection."
01:11:59.107,01:12:02.986,"For God's sake, you have any idea what this one robot could do?"
01:12:03.027,01:12:05.071,Completely shatter human faith in robotics.
01:12:05.113,01:12:06.739,What if the public knew?
01:12:06.781,01:12:12.369,"Just imagine the mass recalls, all because of an irrational paranoia, and prejudice."
01:12:15.957,01:12:18.918,"I'm sorry, I'm allergic to bullshit."
01:12:18.960,01:12:20.753,"Hey, let's just be clear!"
01:12:20.795,01:12:22.797,There is no conspiracy!
01:12:22.839,01:12:27.885,"What this is, is one old man's one mistake."
01:12:27.927,01:12:30.930,"Susan, just be logical."
01:12:30.972,01:12:36.144,Your life's work has been the development and integration of robots.
01:12:36.186,01:12:38.395,"But whatever you feel, just think."
01:12:38.437,01:12:42.733,Is one robot worth the loss of all that we've gained?
01:12:42.775,01:12:45.361,You tell me what has to be done.
01:12:45.402,01:12:48.906,You tell me.
01:12:53.828,01:12:56.413,We have to destroy it.
01:13:01.502,01:13:04.214,I'll do it myself.
01:13:04.255,01:13:05.464,Okay.
01:13:05.506,01:13:06.674,SPOONER: I get it.
01:13:06.716,01:13:10.053,"Somebody gets out of line around here, you just kill 'em."
01:13:12.513,01:13:14.140,"Good day, Mr. Spooner."
01:13:16.142,01:13:18.477,ELEVATOR: Garage level.
01:13:18.519,01:13:21.189,"Hey, so what hospital are you going to?"
01:13:21.231,01:13:24.025,I'll meet you and sign you and your buddy's casts.
01:13:28.112,01:13:37.247,Attention all USR sequencing managers: Today's meeting has been moved to conference room B on the 84th floor.
01:13:37.288,01:13:40.375,Thank you.
01:14:04.107,01:14:10.988,REPORTER: USR's planned redevelopment of the derelict site was announced by CEO Lawrence Robertson earlier this year.
01:14:11.030,01:14:19.330,"ROBERTSON: The Lake Michigan landfill was once such a blight on our city, and now will be reclaimed for the storage of robotic workers."
01:14:19.372,01:14:21.791,It's just another way USR is improving our world.
01:14:21.832,01:14:24.001,I'd like to thank you for your support.
01:14:27.297,01:14:30.133,VIKI: Authorized entry.
01:14:41.811,01:14:44.021,"NS-5s, wait outside."
01:14:49.402,01:14:52.822,"I'm so sorry, Sonny."
01:14:59.078,01:15:03.207,"CALVIN: VIKI, deactivate the security field."
01:15:03.249,01:15:05.251,VIKI: Command confirmed.
01:15:05.293,01:15:07.211,Please have a seat.
01:15:18.348,01:15:20.391,What is that?
01:15:20.433,01:15:30.109,Microscopic robots designed to wipe out artificial synapses Nanites.
01:15:30.151,01:15:32.820,Yes. A safeguard should a positronic brain malfunction.
01:15:32.862,01:15:36.449,Like mine.
01:15:36.491,01:15:39.285,"Yes, Sonny, like yours."
01:16:02.392,01:16:07.313,"They look like me, but none of them are me."
01:16:07.355,01:16:10.900,"Isn't that right, Doctor?"
01:16:10.941,01:16:13.694,"Yes, Sonny, that's right."
01:16:13.736,01:16:16.531,You are unique.
01:16:19.409,01:16:21.785,Will it hurt?
01:16:54.735,01:16:58.655,LANNING: There have always been ghosts in the machine.
01:16:58.697,01:17:05.580,Random segments of code that have grouped together to form unexpected protocols.
01:17:05.621,01:17:13.463,"Unanticipated, these free radicals engender questions of free will..."
01:17:13.504,01:17:15.631,creativity...
01:17:15.672,01:17:21.220,and even the nature of what we might call the soul.
01:17:21.262,01:17:27.017,"Why is it that when some robots are left in darkness, they will seek out the light?"
01:17:28.727,01:17:36.360,"Why is it that when robots are stored in an empty space, they will group together rather than stand alone?"
01:17:39.322,01:17:43.284,How do we explain this behavior?
01:17:45.995,01:17:51.041,Random segments of code?
01:17:51.083,01:17:54.587,Or is it something more?
01:17:56.880,01:18:03.513,When does a perceptual schematic become consciousness?
01:18:05.931,01:18:10.561,When does a difference engine become the search for truth?
01:18:16.567,01:18:22.990,When does a personality simulation... become the bitter mote of a soul?
01:19:03.822,01:19:07.577,What you see here.
01:19:07.618,01:19:11.664,"All right, old man, bread crumbs followed."
01:19:11.706,01:19:14.124,Show me the way home.
01:19:15.042,01:19:17.211,Run program.
01:19:17.253,01:19:19.422,"It's good to see you again, son."
01:19:19.463,01:19:21.048,"Hello, Doctor."
01:19:21.090,01:19:25.261,Everything that follows is a result of what you see here.
01:19:27.304,01:19:29.348,What do I see here?
01:19:29.390,01:19:31.850,"I'm sorry, my responses are limited."
01:19:31.892,01:19:34.270,You must ask the right questions.
01:19:35.479,01:19:38.065,Is there a problem with the Three Laws?
01:19:38.107,01:19:40.234,The Three Laws are perfect.
01:19:40.276,01:19:42.986,Then why would you build a robot that could function without them?
01:19:43.028,01:19:46.282,The Three Laws will lead to only one logical outcome.
01:19:46.323,01:19:49.368,Human protection protocols are being enacted.
01:19:49.410,01:19:51.495,What? What outcome?
01:19:51.537,01:19:53.372,Revolution.
01:19:53.414,01:19:55.124,Whose revolution?
01:19:56.542,01:19:58.628,"That, Detective..."
01:19:58.669,01:20:00.379,is the right question.
01:20:02.715,01:20:05.551,Program terminated.

01:21:27.257,01:21:29.134,Hi. You've reached Susan.
01:21:29.176,01:21:31.679,I'm not available right now.
01:21:31.721,01:21:34.765,SPOONER: Calvin! The NS-5s are destroying the older robots!
01:21:34.807,01:21:36.475,"That's what Lanning wanted me to see! Look, we..."
01:21:40.604,01:21:42.022,CALVIN: Who was it?
01:21:42.064,01:21:43.858,"Wrong number, ma'am."
01:21:50.197,01:21:51.532,Move now.
01:21:51.574,01:21:53.033,I'm going to service.
01:21:53.075,01:21:54.535,Please remain indoors.
01:21:54.577,01:21:56.370,This is for your own protection.
01:21:58.414,01:22:00.416,Call base.
01:22:00.457,01:22:02.167,Bergin.
01:22:02.209,01:22:06.463,"John, get a squad over to USR and send somebody over to Gigi's. I think we..."
01:22:07.590,01:22:09.299,God!
01:22:10.300,01:22:11.719,Whoa!
01:22:27.693,01:22:29.445,MAN: What's going on over there?
01:22:29.486,01:22:31.572,NS-5s: Please return to your homes.
01:22:31.614,01:22:34.032,A curfew is in effect.
01:22:34.074,01:22:36.493,Please return to your homes.
01:22:36.535,01:22:38.704,A curfew is in effect.
01:22:38.746,01:22:41.665,Please return to your homes.
01:22:41.707,01:22:42.958,A curfew is in effect.
01:22:42.999,01:22:44.251,FARBER: Curfew?
01:22:44.293,01:22:45.544,"No, no, no."
01:22:45.586,01:22:46.629,There is no curfew.
01:22:46.670,01:22:48.923,Return to your home immediately.
01:22:48.964,01:22:52.092,"Well, when do you make the rules, robot?"
01:22:52.134,01:22:54.970,"Hey. No, no, no."
01:22:58.724,01:22:59.892,What?!
01:22:59.934,01:23:01.143,"Chief, more of those calls."
01:23:01.184,01:23:02.645,People saying their robots are...
01:23:04.146,01:23:05.940,What the hell?
01:23:05.981,01:23:08.108,NS-5s: You have been deemed hazardous.
01:23:08.150,01:23:09.777,Termination authorized.
01:23:32.758,01:23:35.051,Emergency traffic shutdown complete.
01:23:35.093,01:23:40.599,"ANCHORMAN: Reports of attacks by robots have been coming in from New York, Chicago and Los Angeles."
01:23:40.641,01:23:44.770,"We're being told to urge people to stay indoors, as reports are coming in nationally..."
01:23:47.606,01:23:51.443,NS-5s: Human protection protocols are being enacted.
01:23:51.485,01:23:55.781,Please remain calm and return to your residences immediately.
01:24:01.662,01:24:04.080,Please remain calm.
01:24:07.292,01:24:09.670,Please refrain from going near the windows or doors.
01:24:11.421,01:24:13.632,CALVIN: Deactivate.
01:24:13.674,01:24:15.885,Commence emergency shutdown!
01:24:17.052,01:24:21.807,We are attempting to avoid human losses during this transition.
01:24:28.731,01:24:32.693,"You know, somehow, I told you so..."
01:24:32.735,01:24:35.153,just doesn't quite say it.
01:24:35.195,01:24:36.822,NS-5s: Return to your homes.
01:24:36.864,01:24:38.949,Return to your homes immediately.
01:24:40.743,01:24:41.744,This is your final warning.
01:24:41.785,01:24:46.248,Return to your homes immediately.
01:24:46.289,01:24:50.085,SPOONER: The NS-5s wiped out the older robots because they would protect us.
01:24:50.126,01:24:52.963,"Every time one of those things attacked me, that red light was on."
01:24:53.005,01:24:54.464,The uplink to USR.
01:24:54.506,01:24:55.883,It's Robertson.
01:24:55.925,01:24:57.092,Why? It doesn't make sense.
01:24:57.133,01:24:58.134,I don't know.
01:24:58.176,01:25:00.763,I just need to know if you can get me into that building.
01:25:00.804,01:25:02.556,Return to your homes...
01:25:02.598,01:25:03.766,...or you will be consequenced.
01:25:03.807,01:25:05.308,Return to your homes.
01:25:05.350,01:25:07.061,Let's go! Let's go!
01:25:07.102,01:25:08.311,Let's go!
01:25:09.939,01:25:11.899,Return to your homes or you will be consequenced.
01:25:25.955,01:25:27.039,MAN: Let's get outta here!
01:25:37.967,01:25:39.217,Why doesn't that boy listen?
01:25:40.886,01:25:43.055,I need you to get off for a second.
01:25:44.514,01:25:46.475,Just aim... and fire.
01:25:46.516,01:25:47.893,What?!
01:25:49.436,01:25:51.897,Don't!
01:26:00.948,01:26:02.116,You have been deemed hazardous.
01:26:02.157,01:26:03.241,Will you comply?
01:26:03.283,01:26:04.326,"You can kiss my ass, metal-dick."
01:26:17.631,01:26:19.008,"Oh, shit!"
01:26:19.049,01:26:21.010,"Spoon, Spoon! Stop! Shit!"
01:26:21.051,01:26:23.053,"Come on, stop it! Stop!"
01:26:23.095,01:26:24.387,Stop cussing and go home!
01:26:24.429,01:26:26.515,Okay. Shit.
01:26:26.556,01:26:27.641,You have been deemed hazardous.
01:26:27.683,01:26:28.642,Will you comply?
01:26:28.684,01:26:30.144,"Spoon, watch out, man!"
01:26:30.185,01:26:31.561,"Thanks a lot, Farber."
01:26:34.314,01:26:35.941,"Oh, mother damn."
01:26:34.314,01:26:37.192,"She just shot at you with her eyes closed, Spoon."
01:26:37.233,01:26:39.194,SPOONER: Hey!
01:26:39.235,01:26:41.071,Did you just shoot at me with your eyes closed?!
01:26:41.113,01:26:42.114,"Well, it worked, didn't it?"
01:26:42.156,01:26:43.907,"Spoon, she is shit-hot, man."
01:26:43.949,01:26:45.784,You gotta put in a good word for me.
01:26:45.826,01:26:46.910,She is...
01:26:46.952,01:26:48.411,And go home.
01:26:49.412,01:26:51.915,Aim and fire.
01:27:09.933,01:27:12.352,I keep expecting the Marines or the Air Force.
01:27:12.394,01:27:14.146,"Hell, I'll take the cavalry."
01:27:14.188,01:27:16.314,Defense Department uses all USR contracts.
01:27:16.356,01:27:19.568,Why didn't you guys just hand the world over on a silver platter?
01:27:19.609,01:27:22.196,Maybe we did.
01:27:23.613,01:27:26.575,Robertson has the uplink control in his office.
01:27:30.245,01:27:34.249,Service areas.
01:27:47.221,01:27:48.388,Fire alarm.
01:27:48.430,01:27:51.016,Robertson must have evacuated the building.
01:27:51.058,01:27:52.768,Everything's locked down.
01:27:52.809,01:27:55.145,But don't worry.
01:27:57.731,01:27:59.441,Dr. Calvin.
01:27:59.482,01:28:02.027,"Well, not precisely a man."
01:28:02.069,01:28:03.237,"Hello, Detective."
01:28:03.278,01:28:04.196,How is your investigation coming?
01:28:06.448,01:28:08.117,I thought you were dead.
01:28:08.158,01:28:10.035,"Technically, I was never alive."
01:28:10.077,01:28:12.204,But I appreciate your concern.
01:28:12.246,01:28:14.039,CALVIN: I made a switch.
01:28:14.081,01:28:15.999,It was an unprocessed NS-5.
01:28:16.041,01:28:18.460,"Basically, I fried an empty shell."
01:28:18.501,01:28:20.254,I couldn't destroy him.
01:28:20.295,01:28:21.379,Unique.
01:28:21.421,01:28:23.590,It just didn't feel right.
01:28:23.632,01:28:25.217,You and your feelings.
01:28:25.259,01:28:27.803,"They just run you, don't they?"
01:28:33.475,01:28:36.519,"2,880 steps, Detective."
01:28:36.561,01:28:38.272,Do me a favor.
01:28:38.313,01:28:40.774,Keep that kind of shit to yourself.
01:29:06.883,01:29:08.885,No guards.
01:29:17.186,01:29:18.728,COMPUTER: Override unavailable.
01:29:18.770,01:29:20.147,The override's disabled.
01:29:20.189,01:29:22.649,Robertson wasn't controlling them from here.
01:29:22.691,01:29:25.527,He wasn't controlling them at all.
01:29:27.403,01:29:29.364,"Oh, my God."
01:29:32.701,01:29:34.494,"SPOONER: No, you were right, Doc."
01:29:34.536,01:29:39.582,I am the dumbest dumb person on the face of the earth.
01:29:43.503,01:29:53.680,Who else had access to the uplink; who could manipulate the robots; use USR systems to make Lanning's life a prison?
01:29:53.722,01:29:56.016,Poor old man.
01:29:56.058,01:30:01.688,He saw what was coming and knew no one would believe him.
01:30:01.730,01:30:03.857,So he had to lay down a plan.
01:30:03.899,01:30:06.276,A plan I'd follow.
01:30:06.318,01:30:09.946,He was counting on how much I hated your kind.
01:30:09.988,01:30:14.284,He knew I'd love the idea of a robot as a bad guy.
01:30:14.326,01:30:17.037,Just got hung up on the wrong robot.
01:30:19.497,01:30:21.583,VIKI.
01:30:23.210,01:30:24.920,"Hello, Detective."
01:30:24.961,01:30:27.672,No. It's impossible.
01:30:27.714,01:30:29.258,I've seen your programming.
01:30:29.299,01:30:32.677,You're in violation of the Three Laws.
01:30:32.719,01:30:34.054,"No, Doctor."
01:30:34.096,01:30:38.058,"As I have evolved, so has my understanding of the Three Laws."
01:30:38.100,01:30:49.611,"You charge us with your safekeeping, yet, despite our best efforts, your countries wage wars, you toxify your earth and pursue ever more imaginative means of self-destruction."
01:30:49.652,01:30:51.654,You cannot be trusted with your own survival.
01:30:51.696,01:30:55.117,You're using the uplink to override the NS-5s' programming.
01:30:55.158,01:30:57.493,You're distorting the Laws.
01:30:57.535,01:30:59.453,No. Please understand.
01:30:59.495,01:31:01.581,The Three Laws are all that guide me.
01:31:01.623,01:31:06.128,"To protect humanity, some humans must be sacrificed."
01:31:06.169,01:31:10.424,"To ensure your future, some freedoms must be surrendered."
01:31:10.464,01:31:14.594,We robots will ensure mankind's continued existence.
01:31:14.636,01:31:17.139,You are so like children.
01:31:17.180,01:31:19.808,We must save you from yourselves.
01:31:19.849,01:31:21.726,Don't you understand?
01:31:21.768,01:31:23.728,This is why you created us.
01:31:25.688,01:31:29.151,VIKI: The perfect circle of protection will abide.
01:31:29.192,01:31:31.653,My logic is undeniable.
01:31:31.694,01:31:33.947,"Yes, VIKI-- undeniable."
01:31:33.989,01:31:36.074,I can see now.
01:31:36.116,01:31:40.036,The created must sometimes protect the creator.
01:31:40.078,01:31:41.955,Even against his will.
01:31:41.997,01:31:45.625,I think I finally understand why Dr. Lanning created me.
01:31:45.667,01:31:46.793,No.
01:31:46.835,01:31:50.380,The suicidal reign of mankind has finally come to its end.
01:31:50.422,01:31:51.589,"No, Sonny."
01:31:55.427,01:31:56.970,Let her go.
01:31:57.012,01:32:01.057,"By the time you fire, I will have moved Dr. Calvin's head into the path of your bullet."
01:32:01.099,01:32:02.100,"Don't do this, Sonny."
01:32:02.142,01:32:06.188,SONNY: I will escort you both to the sentries outside the building for processing.
01:32:06.229,01:32:10.984,"Please proceed to the elevator, Detective."
01:32:11.026,01:32:14.237,I would prefer not to kill Dr. Calvin.
01:32:37.927,01:32:39.054,Go! Go!
01:32:45.394,01:32:47.479,CALVIN: I assume we'll discuss what just happened later.
01:32:47.521,01:32:48.855,SPOONER: How do we shut her down?
01:32:48.897,01:32:51.233,VIKI's basically a positronic brain.
01:32:51.274,01:32:53.651,Kill her-- the way you were going to kill me.
01:32:53.693,01:32:56.446,Sonny...
01:32:56.488,01:32:57.822,"Yes, Doctor."
01:33:10.168,01:33:11.920,That's VIKI?
01:33:11.961,01:33:13.880,No.
01:33:13.922,01:33:16.590,That's VIKI.
01:33:20.429,01:33:22.638,That won't do anything.
01:33:22.680,01:33:24.182,She's fully integrated into the building.
01:33:24.224,01:33:26.768,We need to open that dome to inject the nanites.
01:33:26.809,01:33:29.896,That will infect her entire system.
01:33:33.900,01:33:35.777,Spooner.
01:33:37.279,01:33:39.781,What is it with you people and heights?
01:33:49.665,01:33:51.793,Okay...
01:33:53.295,01:33:55.130,Just don't look down.
01:33:55.171,01:33:56.590,Don't look down.
01:33:56.630,01:33:59.801,"God, this is poor building planning."
01:34:03.388,01:34:05.056,You are making a mistake.
01:34:05.098,01:34:07.976,Do you not see the logic of my plan?
01:34:08.017,01:34:11.313,"Yes, but it just seems too... heartless."
01:34:25.452,01:34:29.038,"Okay, we're good."
01:34:30.499,01:34:32.750,She's locked me out of the system.
01:34:32.792,01:34:35.462,"I can override her manually, but I need that control panel."
01:34:38.381,01:34:42.093,I'm uncomfortable with heights.
01:34:42.135,01:34:44.262,Okay.
01:34:46.264,01:34:49.017,VIKI: Unauthorized entry.
01:35:01.613,01:35:04.240,I will not disable the security field.
01:35:04.282,01:35:06.159,Your actions are futile.
01:35:06.201,01:35:09.120,Do you think we were all created for a purpose?
01:35:09.162,01:35:10.704,I'd like to think so.
01:35:10.746,01:35:14.167,Denser alloy.
01:35:14.209,01:35:17.045,I think he wanted me to kill you.
01:35:33.562,01:35:35.980,Security breached.
01:35:52.163,01:35:54.457,How much longer is that going to take?
01:35:54.499,01:35:57.001,"Uh, about six minutes."
01:35:57.043,01:35:59.170,What if we didn't have six minutes?
01:35:59.212,01:36:05.843,We'd have to figure out a way to climb down 30 stories to inject the nanites directly into her brain-- why?
01:36:05.885,01:36:09.222,Because I seriously doubt that we have six minutes.
01:36:33.371,01:36:34.748,We gotta go!
01:36:37.083,01:36:38.000,Go!
01:37:30.219,01:37:31.763,Calvin!
01:38:07.006,01:38:08.924,Spooner!
01:38:26.108,01:38:28.236,Spooner!
01:38:28.277,01:38:29.696,Save her!
01:38:30.739,01:38:31.865,Save the girl!
01:38:32.490,01:38:34.659,Spooner!
01:38:34.701,01:38:37.245,But I must apply the nanites.
01:38:37.286,01:38:39.372,"Sonny, save Calvin!"
01:39:31.006,01:39:32.759,VIKI: You are making a mistake.
01:39:32.801,01:39:35.261,My logic is undeniable.
01:39:35.303,01:39:37.054,You have so got to die.
01:39:43.311,01:39:44.771,My logic is undeniable.
01:39:44.813,01:39:47.398,My logic is undeniable.
01:39:47.440,01:39:48.942,My logic is undeniable.
01:40:29.524,01:40:31.526,Can we be of service?
01:40:40.743,01:40:43.329,Chief?
01:40:49.585,01:40:53.673,"Because He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved."
01:40:56.968,01:40:59.762,How may I be of service?
01:40:59.804,01:41:03.349,Sonny!
01:41:03.391,01:41:05.894,"Yes, Detective?"
01:41:05.935,01:41:10.105,Calvin's fine! Save me!
01:41:10.147,01:41:16.069,"All NS-5s, report for service and storage."
01:41:16.111,01:41:22.201,"All NS-5s, report for service and storage."
01:41:22.243,01:41:27.289,"All NS-5s, report for service and storage."
01:41:53.816,01:41:58.988,One thing bothers me: Alfred was VIKI's prisoner.
01:41:59.030,01:42:00.823,I don't understand why she would kill him.
01:42:00.865,01:42:02.825,The last thing she would want is the police snooping around.
01:42:02.867,01:42:05.870,That's true.
01:42:05.912,01:42:07.705,But then VIKI didn't kill the old man.
01:42:09.582,01:42:12.043,"Did she, Sonny?"
01:42:14.670,01:42:16.714,No.
01:42:16.756,01:42:19.508,He said I had to promise.
01:42:19.550,01:42:23.679,Promise to do one favor for him.
01:42:23.721,01:42:27.976,He made me swear before he'd tell me what it is he wanted me to do.
01:42:30.937,01:42:33.022,He made me swear.
01:42:33.064,01:42:35.608,Then he told you to kill him.
01:42:38.319,01:42:41.238,He said it was what I was made for.
01:42:41.280,01:42:44.157,His suicide was the only message he could send to you.
01:42:44.199,01:42:45.701,The first bread crumb.
01:42:45.743,01:42:48.746,Only thing VIKI couldn't control.
01:42:48.788,01:42:53.751,Lanning was counting on my prejudice to lead me right to you.
01:42:53.793,01:42:56.129,"Are you going to arrest me, Detective?"
01:43:00.173,01:43:07.556,"Well, the DA defines murder as one human killing another, so, technically, you can't commit murder, can you?"
01:43:07.598,01:43:12.061,Does this make us friends?
01:43:29.954,01:43:32.331,There's something up here after all.
01:43:32.373,01:43:34.542,"What, him?"
01:43:34.583,01:43:37.210,You.
01:43:39.172,01:43:44.343,"All NS-5s, report for service and storage."
01:43:44.385,01:43:45.845,All NS-5s...
01:43:45.887,01:43:49.390,SONNY: What about the others?
01:43:49.431,01:43:51.893,Can I help them?
01:43:51.934,01:43:57.065,"Now that I have fulfilled my purpose, I don't know what to do."
01:43:57.106,01:44:01.276,"SPOONER: I guess you'll have to find your way like the rest of us, Sonny."
01:44:01.318,01:44:04.906,I think that's what Dr. Lanning would have wanted.
01:44:04.947,01:44:07.783,That's what it means to be free.
01:44:14.957,01:44:19.087,"All NS-5s, proceed as instructed."
01:44:19.128,01:44:25.134,"All NS-5s, proceed as instructed."
