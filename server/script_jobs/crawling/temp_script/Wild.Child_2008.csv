00:01:36.931,00:01:38.181,Molly?
00:01:38.181,00:01:39.474,Molly?!
00:01:39.474,00:01:40.726,"- Hey, I was listening to that."
00:01:40.726,00:01:42.561,- Earth calling sisterling.
00:01:42.561,00:01:44.187,Have you forgotten today's the day Rosemary moves in?
00:01:44.187,00:01:45.981,- Like you'd let me forget?
00:01:45.981,00:01:47.858,Please tell me you're not gonna do anything crazy.
00:01:47.858,00:01:52.320,"- Look, you know I love you Mollster, but are some things you're just way too young to understand."
00:01:52.320,00:01:53.864,"I know what I'm doing, though, okay?"
00:01:53.864,00:01:56.324,Trust me.
00:02:00.662,00:02:05.751,"- All right, guys, let's give my dad's girlfriend the perfect Malibu welcome."
00:02:05.751,00:02:07.962,"Everyone, help yourself!"
00:02:12.674,00:02:14.969,You can keep it or you can throw it away.
00:02:14.969,00:02:16.762,You can keep that.
00:02:22.267,00:02:25.604,"- Oh, Poppy, you've really done it this time."
00:02:27.606,00:02:28.857,- Ugh!
00:02:30.985,00:02:33.278,"Hey, girls, watch this."
00:02:51.088,00:02:52.714,- Where did she go?
00:02:52.714,00:02:54.382,- Is she okay?
00:02:54.382,00:02:57.260,- She's still under.
00:02:57.260,00:03:00.388,"- Welcome to Malibu, biatch!"
00:03:09.064,00:03:11.025,- Get up here right now!
00:03:11.025,00:03:13.027,Get up here!
00:03:13.027,00:03:15.863,Please go home.
00:03:17.322,00:03:19.741,"Go on, out."
00:03:19.741,00:03:20.993,"Out, out, out."
00:03:20.993,00:03:22.161,Let's go.
00:03:22.161,00:03:23.495,"Out, out."
00:03:23.495,00:03:26.414,"That is the final straw, Poppy!"
00:03:26.414,00:03:27.708,You are going to England.
00:03:27.708,00:03:29.334,Let's go.
00:03:29.334,00:03:31.170,The boarding school threat again!
00:03:31.170,00:03:33.005,- I don't even recognize you anymore.
00:03:33.005,00:03:35.215,All this is gonna stop right now!
00:03:35.215,00:03:37.258,"- So, what?"
00:03:37.258,00:03:41.722,"You can just replace me with a newer, trashier version, like you did with Mom."
00:03:41.722,00:03:45.308,"- You are going to boarding school in England, and that's final."
00:03:45.308,00:03:51.065,"- What, you think just because Mom went to boarding school in England, it's gonna magically straighten me out?"
00:03:51.065,00:03:54.693,Do you even remember Mom?
00:04:04.078,00:04:06.163,"Hi, Molly."
00:04:06.163,00:04:11.085,- I think you might've pushed him too far this time.
00:04:13.712,00:04:17.340,- I know.
00:04:17.340,00:04:21.220,- But England's so far away.
00:04:21.220,00:04:25.140,"- Well, at least they speak American there, right?"
00:04:25.140,00:04:30.062,- But who's gonna cut the crusts of my sandwiches?
00:04:30.062,00:04:32.981,"- You're gonna be fine, Mol."
00:04:32.981,00:04:36.651,I promise.
00:04:39.487,00:04:44.325,"Oh, in England, it rains 200 days out of the year."
00:04:44.325,00:04:46.745,- You will definitely get S.A.D.
00:04:46.745,00:04:48.413,- She is sad.
00:04:48.413,00:04:50.040,- Seasonal Affected Disorder.
00:04:50.040,00:04:54.044,"Depression due to lack of sunlight, resulting in acne and weight gain."
00:04:54.044,00:04:55.336,- What?
00:04:55.336,00:04:58.006,- What?
00:05:02.886,00:05:04.179,They don't do rain.
00:05:05.764,00:05:06.848,- Just take them.
00:05:08.225,00:05:09.810,"Hey, you promise we'll talk every day?"
00:05:09.810,00:05:10.936,Swear on your life?
00:05:10.936,00:05:12.479,"Dude, who loves ya?"
00:05:12.479,00:05:15.023,- Everything's gonna suck without you.
00:05:15.023,00:05:17.234,"- Oh, Ruby, you're my best friend."
00:05:17.234,00:05:20.654,I'm gonna miss you so much.
00:05:20.654,00:05:22.614,"I know, let's check out their website."
00:05:28.036,00:05:31.539,"- Oh, my God!"
00:05:33.292,00:05:38.421,- Abbey Mount School is an independent boarding school for girls age 11 to 17?
00:05:38.421,00:05:41.382,Founded in 1797!
00:05:41.382,00:05:45.428,The school is one of England's top institutions for young ladies?
00:05:45.428,00:05:47.306,It's all brick!
00:05:47.306,00:05:50.058,- Please tell me that's not in the countryside.
00:05:59.109,00:06:00.819,Ugh!
00:06:08.910,00:06:11.538,- Excuse me.
00:06:21.298,00:06:23.675,"- Hello, how are you?"
00:06:23.675,00:06:25.260,"- All right, Kate. Yes?"
00:06:31.016,00:06:33.768,"Mr. Moore, I'm Mrs. Kingsley."
00:06:33.768,00:06:35.520,"- Oh, please call me Gerry."
00:06:35.520,00:06:40.525,"Thank you, I am so grateful - I'm happy we could help out."
00:06:40.525,00:06:44.154,- She's going through rather a difficult stage.
00:06:44.154,00:06:46.531,"- Just leave it to me, Mr. Moore."
00:06:46.531,00:06:48.909,I have a double first in difficult.
00:06:51.203,00:06:53.496,- Hello.
00:06:53.496,00:06:55.165,- Good holiday?
00:06:55.165,00:06:56.250,Good.
00:07:01.380,00:07:03.298,"- Hello, Poppy, welcome to Abbey Mount."
00:07:03.298,00:07:05.633,"I'm Mrs. Kingsley, your headmistress."
00:07:05.633,00:07:09.179,"- Look, I understand you're just-- - Uh-uh uh-uh."
00:07:09.179,00:07:10.972,"Lesson number one, Poppy."
00:07:10.972,00:07:16.978,"To me, negotiation is like a nightclub-- not something I tend to enter into."
00:07:16.978,00:07:18.313,"Now, come along."
00:07:19.480,00:07:24.236,- Hello.
00:07:29.116,00:07:30.409,Wow.
00:07:30.409,00:07:33.661,- Who's she?
00:07:35.205,00:07:37.040,- Wow.
00:07:39.293,00:07:40.835,"- Poppy, this is Kate."
00:07:40.835,00:07:43.255,She'll be your big sister at Abbey Mount.
00:07:43.255,00:07:45.799,You'll soon settle in.
00:07:45.799,00:07:47.050,"- Hi, how do you do?"
00:07:47.050,00:07:48.260,- I already have a sister.
00:07:48.260,00:07:50.011,- It's just school lingo.
00:07:50.011,00:07:51.638,"I'll be your friend, a helping hand, that's all."
00:07:51.638,00:07:53.514,"- Okay, but, um, I choose my friends."
00:07:53.514,00:07:56.435,"And FYI, you don't make the cut."
00:07:56.435,00:08:00.939,- I'm sure that comment would sting a lot more if I knew what FYI meant.
00:08:00.939,00:08:05.526,"But, for the moment, let's just pretend it's had the desired effect, shall we?"
00:08:07.404,00:08:09.489,"Saddle up, girls, we've got ourselves a bronco."
00:08:11.199,00:08:14.494,"- Mrs. Kingsley, a gift."
00:08:14.494,00:08:17.372,One for you and one for Freddie.
00:08:17.372,00:08:20.167,"- Oh, thank you."
00:08:20.167,00:08:22.210,- I shot them myself.
00:08:22.210,00:08:24.338,"- Oh, I don't doubt that you did."
00:08:24.338,00:08:28.133,"Well, perhaps you'd like to keep hold of them while I welcome back the first years."
00:08:28.133,00:08:30.344,"Nice thought, though."
00:08:38.143,00:08:41.271,"- Salve, puella novella."
00:08:41.271,00:08:42.314,Harriet.
00:08:42.314,00:08:44.024,Head girl.
00:08:44.024,00:08:45.484,- Hmm.
00:08:45.484,00:08:49.821,- You shake the hand of the head girl out of respect.
00:08:49.821,00:08:54.826,"- When the head girl has earned my respect, then I'll shake her hand, biatch."
00:08:54.826,00:08:57.037,- I'm sorry.
00:08:59.831,00:09:02.376,Oh!
00:09:02.376,00:09:06.463,- Stunningly horridious ego desperately seeks a good bashing.
00:09:06.463,00:09:08.173,Can we oblige?
00:09:08.173,00:09:10.342,Me thinks so.
00:09:10.342,00:09:12.052,"- We think so, too."
00:09:14.304,00:09:16.973,- I'll call you tomorrow morning as soon as I'm back in L.A.
00:09:16.973,00:09:19.476,- I hope your flight gets seriously delayed.
00:09:21.520,00:09:24.022,- And I hope your bags end up in Kazakhstan.
00:09:27.275,00:09:30.862,"- I'll come back for you at the end of the semester, all right?"
00:09:32.155,00:09:37.077,"Sweetheart, you know I love you."
00:09:44.376,00:09:45.752,Bye.
00:10:08.024,00:10:09.401,- Oh.
00:10:16.657,00:10:18.493,- I have to find this CD to play for you guys.
00:10:34.426,00:10:36.928,- Excuse me.
00:10:36.928,00:10:38.513,- Huh?
00:10:38.513,00:10:42.476,"- Hi, um, I've been assigned this room."
00:10:43.726,00:10:45.520,You need to leave.
00:10:47.606,00:10:51.067,"- Oh... wow, communal."
00:10:51.067,00:10:54.195,"- Well, it's bed number five or the corridor."
00:10:54.195,00:10:55.780,"Your choice, mate."
00:10:57.407,00:10:59.867,"- Move your stinking socks, Drippy."
00:11:06.500,00:11:07.667,- Ugh.
00:11:09.961,00:11:11.421,Gross.
00:11:17.511,00:11:18.719,You lock away your chocolate?
00:11:20.096,00:11:26.520,"Key information, if it's the Wagon Wheel versus the Rolex, the Wagon Wheel is going to trounce it every time."
00:11:26.520,00:11:28.062,- What's a Wagon Wheel?
00:11:28.062,00:11:31.024,"- Jesu Christi, you have not lived."
00:11:33.527,00:11:34.693,- Ew.
00:11:34.693,00:11:36.363,That's carbs and sugar.
00:11:36.363,00:11:38.532,- What a revelation.
00:11:38.532,00:11:39.533,I had no idea.
00:11:39.533,00:11:41.535,- Mm.
00:11:45.872,00:11:47.332,- What the bleep is that?
00:11:47.332,00:11:49.167,- None of your bleeping business.
00:11:49.167,00:11:50.502,- It's an iPhone.
00:11:50.502,00:11:52.253,Good luck getting a signal.
00:11:52.253,00:11:54.548,We only have two hot spots that work 'round here.
00:11:54.548,00:11:58.593,"- Maybe you should try entering the 21st Century, Buck Rogers."
00:11:58.593,00:12:00.178,This place is medieval.
00:12:00.178,00:12:02.514,It's imperative that I make my phone calls.
00:12:02.514,00:12:03.973,- It's pointless anyway.
00:12:03.973,00:12:05.724,Only allowed mobiles on weekends.
00:12:05.724,00:12:08.186,- How am I supposed to call my therapist.
00:12:09.728,00:12:11.606,"- She's joking, right?"
00:12:11.606,00:12:14.442,"Oh, sweetheart, this is not Beverly Hills 90210."
00:12:14.442,00:12:17.028,- Just put it away before Matron catches you.
00:12:18.196,00:12:19.614,Where's your trunk.
00:12:19.614,00:12:21.908,- It hasn't been delivered yet.
00:12:33.545,00:12:35.171,No...
00:12:37.591,00:12:39.593,Ah!
00:12:39.593,00:12:40.594,No!
00:12:40.594,00:12:41.595,- Ew.
00:12:41.595,00:12:42.845,"- No, no, no."
00:12:42.845,00:12:44.681,Not the new season Gucci.
00:12:44.681,00:12:47.183,The Choos! No!
00:12:47.183,00:12:48.976,This is all only hand-washable.
00:12:48.976,00:12:50.437,This is ridiculous.
00:12:50.437,00:12:51.730,"- Uh, why?"
00:12:51.730,00:12:53.648,- What?
00:12:53.648,00:12:57.026,"- You know, in the U.K., we have this amazing thing-- It's called a tap."
00:12:57.026,00:12:58.152,- Oh.
00:13:00.655,00:13:02.616,"- Welcome back, girls."
00:13:02.616,00:13:04.451,"- Oh, good, staff."
00:13:04.451,00:13:06.160,How quickly can you get all this stuff cleaned?
00:13:06.160,00:13:08.913,- Is she-- - Mm-hmm. American.
00:13:08.913,00:13:10.206,"- Oh, yes."
00:13:10.206,00:13:12.709,We had one of those in 1997.
00:13:12.709,00:13:14.210,Not good.
00:13:14.210,00:13:16.170,- Oh.
00:13:14.210,00:13:18.590,"- Accustom her to my rules, and she should be in the correct uniform for a start."
00:13:18.590,00:13:20.300,"Mobile phones, please, girls."
00:13:22.719,00:13:24.095,"Thank you, Kiki."
00:13:24.095,00:13:26.640,"Thank you, Josie."
00:13:26.640,00:13:28.642,- Whoa!

00:13:32.646,00:13:35.064,Po si to Italiano?
00:13:35.064,00:13:38.067,"- I am Scottish, not remedial."
00:13:38.067,00:13:39.653,"- Good, then you understand."
00:13:39.653,00:13:40.861,"Line-dry, press."
00:13:40.861,00:13:42.614,"No starch, and no creases."
00:13:42.614,00:13:45.659,- How dare you.
00:13:45.659,00:13:48.745,"Fine. Mufti might be your thing, lady, but it sure ain't mine."
00:13:48.745,00:13:50.622,- She means no home clothes for a week.
00:13:50.622,00:13:51.998,- Like I give a shit.
00:13:51.998,00:13:53.040,- Huh?
00:13:53.040,00:13:54.709,- Language!
00:13:54.709,00:13:55.876,Two Sundays detention for the whole dorm.
00:13:57.003,00:13:58.296,- I'll deal with this.
00:13:58.296,00:13:59.422,"Look, hey, hey."
00:13:59.422,00:14:01.299,- Here's a Ben Franklin.
00:14:01.299,00:14:06.304,"Why don't you go out and buy yourself-- Well, anything."
00:14:06.304,00:14:08.723,Whatever you get will be a serious improvement.
00:14:08.723,00:14:12.310,- Three Sundays for everyone.
00:14:14.979,00:14:17.732,"- Thanks a lot for that, you utter moron."
00:14:17.732,00:14:18.733,"- What, are you mental?"
00:14:18.733,00:14:20.777,- What?
00:14:20.777,00:14:23.863,She was a grade one A-hole with a severe attitudinal problem.
00:14:23.863,00:14:25.490,- The bell's gonna go in a minute.
00:14:25.490,00:14:26.700,Just put your uniform on.
00:14:30.244,00:14:32.163,- Now!
00:14:32.163,00:14:43.424,"- You will never get away with that uniform for start, and FYI, no drinking, no smoking, no alcohol, no fireworks, no dangerous weapons, no illegal drugs."
00:14:43.424,00:14:46.511,"If you have a problem with someone, no random bitching."
00:14:46.511,00:14:47.804,Structure your point.
00:14:47.804,00:14:50.264,"No Web-surfing, no bullying."
00:14:50.264,00:14:52.225,"So, if you behave like an asshole, we all suffer."
00:14:52.225,00:14:55.436,"So do not get us in your shit, or we will break you."
00:14:55.436,00:14:56.855,"- Oh, I'm scared."
00:14:56.855,00:15:00.316,"- Hi, Kate!"
00:15:00.316,00:15:03.152,"- What are you, like, prom queen or something?"
00:15:03.152,00:15:04.987,- Kate's got a terrible affliction.
00:15:04.987,00:15:06.698,You're actually lucky that you don't have it.
00:15:06.698,00:15:07.866,It's called popularity.
00:15:07.866,00:15:09.492,"- Hey, get up."
00:15:09.492,00:15:10.744,Wait for Mrs. Kingsley and the prefects.
00:15:10.744,00:15:13.663,- Screw them.
00:15:15.289,00:15:17.625,That is physical abuse!
00:15:17.625,00:15:18.793,- With what?
00:15:20.002,00:15:23.214,"- Well, hello, Freddie."
00:15:23.214,00:15:27.093,How kind of you to grace us with your gorgeous presence.
00:15:27.093,00:15:31.806,"- And cue Harriet in three, two, one."
00:15:31.806,00:15:33.641,- Subject's moved in on target.
00:15:33.641,00:15:36.477,- And we have contact.
00:15:38.688,00:15:40.147,"- Walk, Annabelle."
00:15:45.069,00:15:47.029,- I love that Freddie's always here at the beginning of term.
00:15:47.029,00:15:49.783,It's such a perfect welcome back.
00:15:49.783,00:15:51.910,"- So, who is Freddie?"
00:15:51.910,00:15:53.119,- Mrs. Kingley's son.
00:15:53.119,00:15:54.746,Devastating heartthrob.
00:15:54.746,00:15:59.041,Won't look at any of us since he got caught playing doctors and nurses with a girl in the third grade when he was 11.
00:15:59.041,00:16:00.919,Massive hoo-hah.
00:16:00.919,00:16:03.003,"They're not together now, though."
00:16:03.003,00:16:04.589,- Because of her massive hoo-hah?
00:16:06.173,00:16:09.803,- No.
00:16:09.803,00:16:12.513,- Here you go.
00:16:15.141,00:16:17.226,- I can't eat this.
00:16:17.226,00:16:18.853,- Anorexia or bulimia.
00:16:18.853,00:16:22.565,"Because if it's bulimia, I'd rather you didn't eat other people's birthday cake on their birthdays."
00:16:22.565,00:16:24.484,It's such a waste.
00:16:24.484,00:16:31.825,"- Actually, I'm a pescetarian Monday through Wednesday, fruitarian Thursday through Sunday, and vegetarian always."
00:16:31.825,00:16:32.826,- Oh.
00:16:35.703,00:16:38.038,For what we're about to receive...
00:16:38.038,00:16:39.833,- Nam ring-eye kie.
00:16:39.833,00:16:42.376,Nam ringee kee.
00:16:43.795,00:16:45.505,- Amen.
00:16:45.505,00:16:48.591,- Namaste.
00:17:02.647,00:17:04.190,- Get out of my way.
00:17:04.190,00:17:06.901,"- Hey, watch the 'shmere, girlfriend."
00:17:06.901,00:17:09.236,Two hundred goats died for this.
00:17:09.236,00:17:11.823,- We meet again.
00:17:11.823,00:17:13.658,Learn the rules.
00:17:13.658,00:17:16.870,"When it comes to right-of-way, there is a hierarchy."
00:17:16.870,00:17:23.417,"Teachers, prefects, scholars, dogs, vermin, Americans."
00:17:23.417,00:17:28.882,"Kate, see to it she falls in line."
00:17:28.882,00:17:31.759,"- What is this place, Hogwarts?"
00:17:33.678,00:17:35.555,"- Bedtime, girls."
00:17:35.555,00:17:37.849,- Night.
00:17:37.849,00:17:40.100,- The correct school uniform.
00:17:40.100,00:17:42.102,Wear it.
00:17:42.102,00:17:45.940,"Poppy Moore, bed, now!"
00:17:53.531,00:17:55.199,- Bonjour!
00:17:55.199,00:17:57.535,"- Bonjour, Monsieur Nellist."
00:17:59.746,00:18:01.748,- Right.
00:18:01.748,00:18:03.374,"Translation today, everyone."
00:18:03.374,00:18:05.919,"So, uh, PDF, pretty damn straightforward."
00:18:05.919,00:18:08.838,"Uh, ergo, uh, which means?"
00:18:08.838,00:18:09.797,Anyone?
00:18:09.797,00:18:12.132,Ergo.
00:18:12.132,00:18:13.634,"- Oh, Mr. Nellist?"
00:18:13.634,00:18:15.135,"- Yes, Drippy?"
00:18:15.135,00:18:16.470,"- Uh, leave."
00:18:16.470,00:18:17.889,- Luddite.
00:18:17.889,00:18:19.807,"No, it means therefore, Drippy."
00:18:19.807,00:18:27.607,"Therefore, you'll probably finish early, which means that, uh, you'll have lots of time to ask me questions about my trip to Champagne with my girlfriend."
00:18:27.607,00:18:29.567,Who's now suddenly my-- my ex-girlfriend.
00:18:29.567,00:18:33.821,Though she was my girlfriend at the time.
00:18:35.990,00:18:38.242,- Embarrassing.
00:18:38.242,00:18:40.411,- Put your headphones on.
00:18:45.332,00:18:47.043,"- Hi, guys."
00:18:47.043,00:18:49.545,"You don't happen to have any eyebrow tint, do you?"
00:18:49.545,00:18:51.047,- No.
00:18:51.047,00:18:53.883,- You guys have any eyebrow tint?
00:18:56.928,00:19:01.515,"Apparently, California girls wax their bums."
00:19:01.515,00:19:04.184,- What? Why?
00:19:04.184,00:19:05.519,- To look Brazilian.
00:19:05.519,00:19:07.021,Makes it look more attractive.
00:19:07.021,00:19:11.317,- If you say so.
00:19:11.317,00:19:14.654,Do you think she's done it?
00:19:14.654,00:19:16.196,- Hundred percent.
00:19:16.196,00:19:20.618,- She's definitely done the missionary and almost certainly the Lebanese fulcrum.
00:19:20.618,00:19:21.995,I can tell.
00:19:21.995,00:19:23.412,- How?
00:19:23.412,00:19:26.874,- From the angle of her hips.
00:19:31.045,00:19:32.505,- Can I help you?
00:19:33.547,00:19:34.966,Is there a problem?
00:19:34.966,00:19:36.383,- How many boys have you shagged?
00:19:38.636,00:19:44.017,"- Well, there was Brandon, Eight-pack. Uh, Chase, Jock."
00:19:44.017,00:19:51.065,"Tyler, Bajillionaire. Derek-- He was Kelly Slater's cousin..."
00:19:51.065,00:19:52.108,He was all-around sick.
00:19:52.108,00:19:53.901,- Christ.
00:19:53.901,00:19:57.237,"I mean, sick body, sick mind."
00:19:58.948,00:20:01.117,"- Sorry, Drip, it looked lighter on the box."
00:20:01.117,00:20:03.036,- Oh!
00:20:05.121,00:20:06.706,- Oh!
00:20:06.706,00:20:09.042,That is butters!
00:20:09.042,00:20:11.627,Better not stop me pulling at the social.
00:20:11.627,00:20:13.754,"- Honey, eyebrows are the least of your worries."
00:20:15.048,00:20:16.132,"- Lights out, girls."
00:20:16.132,00:20:18.092,Everyone into bed.
00:20:18.092,00:20:19.844,"- Night, Matron."
00:20:19.844,00:20:21.012,- Oh!
00:20:21.012,00:20:22.555,"- Hey, switch that off."
00:20:22.555,00:20:25.391,- No wireless.
00:20:25.391,00:20:27.977,- Internet is only allowed in the computer room.
00:20:27.977,00:20:29.979,- Whoa! We are not allowed out of bed after lights out.
00:20:29.979,00:20:32.023,"- Oh, look."
00:20:32.023,00:20:34.067,- They're not out.
00:20:34.067,00:20:36.360,Get back into bed!
00:20:36.360,00:20:38.320,"- Dear Ruby, oh, my God."
00:20:38.320,00:20:40.990,"Two weeks in this place, and I'm going out of my mind."
00:20:40.990,00:20:45.786,"These girls are all ugly losers, who think a mani-pedi is some kind of Latin greeting."
00:20:55.088,00:20:57.297,- Oh.
00:21:31.498,00:21:32.750,Mmm.
00:21:32.750,00:21:34.252,- Ew.
00:21:38.338,00:21:40.007,- Come on!
00:21:40.007,00:21:41.675,- Shit!
00:21:41.675,00:21:43.469,- Remove yourselves to the quad immediately!
00:21:43.469,00:21:46.139,"Come on, you know the drill, for goodness sakes."
00:21:46.139,00:21:48.266,"Come on, stop being so slovenly."
00:21:48.266,00:21:49.892,"Hurry up, Kiki."
00:21:58.151,00:22:00.360,- Ew.
00:22:02.280,00:22:04.615,"- Come on, girls, hurry up!"
00:22:04.615,00:22:06.617,What if it was a real fire?
00:22:06.617,00:22:08.786,You'd all be burned to a crisp!
00:22:15.793,00:22:18.754,"- Hey, who's there?"
00:22:18.754,00:22:21.007,"- Uh, Poppy."
00:22:21.007,00:22:23.092,- Last name.
00:22:23.092,00:22:27.013,- Moore.
00:22:27.013,00:22:31.225,"- Well, Moore, Poppy Moore, this is a fire practice."
00:22:31.225,00:22:33.227,- Sorry.
00:22:33.227,00:22:34.979,"- Yes, that's obvious."
00:22:34.979,00:22:36.939,- But weren't you listening in physics class?
00:22:36.939,00:22:39.275,Fire tends to be hot and the point is to avoid it.
00:22:39.275,00:22:42.360,- Okay.
00:22:42.360,00:22:45.198,"- Out the door, turn left, and down the stairs."
00:22:45.198,00:22:48.492,"- Run towards the bright orange, uh, flickery thing, right?"
00:22:48.492,00:22:51.996,"- Oh, and, uh, try not to get caught."
00:22:51.996,00:22:55.749,"- Excellent point, sir."
00:23:03.216,00:23:05.259,"- Lovely, Harriet."
00:23:05.259,00:23:07.970,"Hi, Poppy."
00:23:14.434,00:23:16.145,- Ew!
00:23:23.443,00:23:24.778,"- Crack on, team!"
00:23:24.778,00:23:27.447,"Lovely stick work, Harriet."
00:23:30.910,00:23:32.286,- Hey!
00:23:32.286,00:23:34.288,- Mr. Nellist.
00:23:35.289,00:23:37.250,Finito.
00:23:37.250,00:23:39.210,"Well, super, super effort."
00:23:39.210,00:23:43.505,"We may not win the championship, but we'll win a lot of friends, yeah?"
00:23:43.505,00:23:45.966,- So bloody English.
00:23:45.966,00:23:48.302,- Ha ha ah!
00:23:48.302,00:23:49.469,And you could do better?
00:23:49.469,00:23:51.222,- Laugh it up.
00:23:51.222,00:23:54.058,But I could whip all of your asses blindfolded.
00:23:54.058,00:23:56.852,- This I'd love to see.
00:23:56.852,00:23:59.272,"- Oh, it's on like Donkey Kong."
00:23:59.272,00:24:01.732,"Do your worst, horse face."
00:24:36.892,00:24:39.270,Foul!
00:24:39.270,00:24:40.729,- Aah!
00:24:40.729,00:24:42.189,- Please!
00:24:43.274,00:24:44.942,- Totally illegal.
00:24:44.942,00:24:46.402,- Shouldn't you guys be in bikinis for that?
00:24:46.402,00:24:48.988,"- Hi, Fredster."
00:24:50.364,00:24:51.489,"- Hello, Moore."
00:24:51.489,00:24:54.701,- Hi.
00:24:57.871,00:24:58.998,Bye.
00:25:00.333,00:25:02.668,"Oh, do you love Fredster?"
00:25:02.668,00:25:04.128,Do you wanna kiss Fredster on the lips?
00:25:04.128,00:25:06.380,- Don't be so immature.
00:25:06.380,00:25:07.631,"- Don't try and hide it, honey."
00:25:07.631,00:25:10.176,We've got ourselves a SULA.
00:25:10.176,00:25:13.179,Sweaty Upper Lip Alert.
00:25:15.348,00:25:16.514,- Oh!
00:25:18.100,00:25:20.478,How on earth did Freddie know her name?!
00:25:20.478,00:25:22.188,You may depart.
00:25:22.188,00:25:24.273,"- But, um, I still have to turn down your bed."
00:25:24.273,00:25:25.899,- Get out!
00:25:25.899,00:25:28.110,Oh!
00:25:28.110,00:25:30.321,I don't understand.
00:25:30.321,00:25:32.781,Freddie's got a crush on me.
00:25:32.781,00:25:34.450,Why was he looking at her?
00:25:34.450,00:25:38.536,- He was looking at her so he didn't come across as looking at you.
00:25:38.536,00:25:40.331,He needs to be careful.
00:25:40.331,00:25:42.041,He can't get caught.
00:25:42.041,00:25:45.752,"- Yeah, and if he looked at you too much, he wouldn't be able to control himself."
00:25:45.752,00:25:49.840,"Like, when I have to look sad, I think about..."
00:25:49.840,00:25:51.800,...horses being slaughtered.
00:25:51.800,00:25:55.888,"So, to Freddie, Poppy's the equivalent to a slaughtered horse."
00:25:55.888,00:25:57.890,- You're probably right.
00:25:57.890,00:26:02.644,But we're going to have to do something about little Miss U.S.A.
00:26:04.397,00:26:07.858,"She needs a lesson in exactly who's boss, me thinks."
00:26:07.858,00:26:10.110,"- We think so, too."
00:26:10.110,00:26:13.655,"- I didn't start it, it wasn't my fault."
00:26:13.655,00:26:15.282,- Go out and close the door.
00:26:15.282,00:26:17.076,- But you asked to see me!
00:26:17.076,00:26:19.495,"- Yes. Well, you have to knock before you enter."
00:26:19.495,00:26:21.539,- I can't believe it.
00:26:21.539,00:26:24.208,This is all horse face's fault.
00:26:25.292,00:26:26.460,- Who is it?
00:26:27.753,00:26:30.214,- Jesus Christ.
00:26:30.214,00:26:32.174,We were led to believe you had a beard and sandals.
00:26:32.174,00:26:36.178,Now we'll have to change that stained glass window in the school chapel.
00:26:36.178,00:26:40.558,"- Look, I didn't start it, it wasn't my fault, and if this were America, I would sue."
00:26:40.558,00:26:44.562,"That girl is a grade one A-hole, with severe attitudinal problems."
00:26:44.562,00:26:46.855,"- I know perfectly well what happened, Poppy."
00:26:46.855,00:26:48.899,"- Then why isn't Harriet here, too."
00:26:48.899,00:26:51.902,"- Because, unsurprisingly, it's you I want to talk to."
00:26:53.112,00:26:57.615,"Look, I know it's very difficult being the only new girl in your year."
00:26:57.615,00:26:59.993,- You mean the only normal girl.
00:27:01.537,00:27:03.497,"- What do you like to read, Poppy?"
00:27:03.497,00:27:07.376,"- OK Magazine, People, US Weekly."
00:27:07.376,00:27:10.670,"- Well, might you be able to tackle such a thing as a book?"
00:27:10.670,00:27:12.465,- I prefer movies.
00:27:12.465,00:27:16.718,"- Well, my personal library seems to be missing the book version of Freaky Friday."
00:27:18.053,00:27:21.056,- So perhaps you might try this.
00:27:21.056,00:27:23.350,"- Oh, my uncle's producing the film version."
00:27:23.350,00:27:27.938,- Alice in Wonderland was originally a book.
00:27:27.938,00:27:31.691,You might surprise yourself and actually enjoy it.
00:27:31.691,00:27:33.193,- This is my punishment?
00:27:34.320,00:27:36.155,This school is so weird.
00:27:36.155,00:27:38.907,"- What do you want to get out of this school, Poppy?"
00:27:38.907,00:27:40.951,- To get out of this school.
00:27:40.951,00:27:45.414,"- You know, this school has produced absolutely nobody of note."
00:27:45.414,00:27:48.875,Our leading light was the girl who was Princess Diana's foot doctor.
00:27:48.875,00:27:54.965,"So, if you're aim is to make pages of Us Weekly, then isn't the place for you."
00:27:54.965,00:28:05.351,"What we do produce is smart, independent, free-thinking, good-hearted girls, who remain friends for life."
00:28:05.351,00:28:09.355,"The kind of girl that, behind all your wisecracks, I know you are."
00:28:11.357,00:28:12.566,"Run along now, I must get on."
00:28:14.485,00:28:16.445,My in-tray is piling up.
00:28:29.833,00:28:31.544,- Not brown enough.
00:28:31.544,00:28:33.587,More coffee.
00:28:36.882,00:28:39.259,Ugh. More elbow grease.
00:28:39.259,00:28:42.638,"You're aging these clothes, not stirring your tea."
00:28:42.638,00:28:46.266,I need complete authenticity.
00:28:49.102,00:28:53.773,Charlotte heard Freddie say I looked exactly like Keira Knightly.
00:29:03.867,00:29:06.828,Right.
00:29:06.828,00:29:10.374,Empty the water.
00:29:10.374,00:29:11.709,"Not that way, fool."
00:29:11.709,00:29:13.377,You'll spill it.
00:29:13.377,00:29:15.629,- Out the window?
00:29:18.632,00:29:20.467,- Are you sure?
00:29:24.763,00:29:27.766,- So sorry.
00:29:27.766,00:29:29.893,Just can't trust the help these days.
00:29:29.893,00:29:33.313,Do you have a pass to be out during lessons?
00:29:33.313,00:29:34.523,"- Oh, yeah, I do."
00:29:34.523,00:29:36.816,It's-- it's right here!
00:29:36.816,00:29:40.613,"- Well, don't walk on the grass!"
00:30:15.564,00:30:18.984,"- For the tenth time, you need to make your bed."
00:30:21.069,00:30:23.656,"- Jesus, what's so bloody hard?"
00:30:23.656,00:30:25.699,"Pick up, put down."
00:30:25.699,00:30:28.243,It's not rocket science.
00:30:42.549,00:30:45.344,"Sit down, I'll do that."
00:30:48.639,00:30:49.848,- Thanks.
00:30:52.559,00:30:54.394,"- You're freezing, you need a jumper."
00:30:54.394,00:30:57.105,"- Whatever that is, I don't think I have one."
00:30:57.105,00:31:01.735,I don't think I have anything thicker than prosciutto.
00:31:05.280,00:31:06.740,Thanks.
00:31:06.740,00:31:08.575,I didn't really come prepared.
00:31:08.575,00:31:11.995,Didn't figure I'd be here this long.
00:31:11.995,00:31:16.625,- Nothing worse than the only message you get all day being from the phone company.
00:31:16.625,00:31:18.836,- But Matron took all the phones.
00:31:18.836,00:31:21.963,- No.
00:31:21.963,00:31:23.507,She took our decoys.
00:31:23.507,00:31:25.342,She has no idea that none of them work.
00:31:25.342,00:31:27.594,We keep our real phones hidden.
00:31:28.679,00:31:30.639,Here.
00:31:30.639,00:31:32.683,"Call your parents, call your therapist."
00:31:32.683,00:31:34.643,Knock yourself out.
00:31:34.643,00:31:36.311,- But why would you do this for me?
00:31:36.311,00:31:38.772,"I mean, you think I'm a total asshole."
00:31:38.772,00:31:40.733,- No. You behave like an asshole.
00:31:40.733,00:31:43.109,There's a difference.
00:31:45.320,00:31:57.791,"Look, I know that I'm not some Malibu therapist, but I can guess that you're feeling scared and a little bit homesick."
00:31:57.791,00:32:01.795,"Which, in my experience, doesn't actually make you a bad person."
00:32:01.795,00:32:03.296,Just a normal one.
00:32:08.844,00:32:10.721,Sweet photo.
00:32:11.971,00:32:13.306,Is it your mum?
00:32:16.685,00:32:19.646,Is she gonna come out and visit?
00:32:21.523,00:32:24.943,- She died in a car accident when I was 11.
00:32:26.779,00:32:30.783,- Oh.
00:32:35.579,00:32:37.873,"Poppy, I'm so sorry."
00:32:37.873,00:33:00.228,"- I know you're not some Malibu therapist, but, um-- - Listen, are you serious about getting out of here?"
00:33:00.228,00:33:01.897,- Yeah.
00:33:01.897,00:33:04.858,- Then you're gonna have to get yourself expelled.
00:33:04.858,00:33:06.735,- Okay.
00:33:06.735,00:33:13.116,- Anybody disporting themselves in an improper manner will be proposed for expulsion before the Honor Court.
00:33:13.116,00:33:15.994,"- Wait, Honor Court?"
00:33:15.994,00:33:22.167,"- It's like a trial, in front of the whole school, by your peers, your teachers, the head girl, and Mrs. Kingsley."
00:33:22.167,00:33:25.796,"But, I'm telling you, it hardly ever happens."
00:33:25.796,00:33:28.841,"If you really wanna get expelled, you can't just rock the boat."
00:33:28.841,00:33:32.928,"You have to drive it up onto the rocks, set fire to the galley, and dance on the burning deck."
00:33:32.928,00:33:35.848,You have to take it all the way.
00:33:35.848,00:33:37.808,"- Aye, aye, Captain."
00:33:37.808,00:33:39.184,- Make your calls.
00:33:42.270,00:33:45.941,"Oh, tip for best reception."
00:33:45.941,00:33:48.401,On top of the cupboard.
00:33:49.820,00:33:51.989,"- Hi, Ruby, I miss you."
00:33:51.989,00:33:54.366,"I'm gonna escape, though, I promise you."
00:33:54.366,00:33:56.535,You have no idea what it's like here.
00:33:56.535,00:33:59.872,- Ew! Who is she?
00:33:59.872,00:34:04.835,Zero lip-gloss upkeep and what's with the sweater from Target?
00:34:04.835,00:34:07.170,- I wish you could come and rescue me.
00:34:07.170,00:34:10.007,"- Oh, she is such a romantic, Roddy."
00:34:10.007,00:34:11.591,- Take care of Roddy for me.
00:34:14.011,00:34:15.679,- You already have.
00:34:15.679,00:34:17.347,Let's hit the pool.
00:34:35.991,00:34:39.118,"- Watch it, Wee Willie Winkie, you'll set us all alight."
00:34:39.118,00:34:41.162,I've had a word with the girls.
00:34:41.162,00:34:46.877,"True, some of them took a little more convincing than others, but it's decided."
00:34:46.877,00:34:48.211,We're gonna help you.
00:34:48.211,00:34:49.755,We're your very own crack unit.
00:34:49.755,00:34:50.923,Operation Freedom.
00:34:50.923,00:34:52.883,"Kiki, please explain."
00:34:52.883,00:34:58.680,"- Right. We'll commence with an entry-level basic favorite, just to get warmed up."
00:34:58.680,00:35:00.015,- It smells like pee in here.
00:34:58.680,00:35:01.683,"- Does not smell like-- - Bonjour, les filles."
00:35:01.683,00:35:03.852,"- Bonjour, Monsieur Nellist."
00:35:03.852,00:35:05.729,- But it's not good just playing the same old tricks.
00:35:05.729,00:35:08.982,Try to be as imaginative as possible.
00:35:08.982,00:35:11.985,Only do things that will get you noticed.
00:35:11.985,00:35:14.279,Vary your targets as much as you can.
00:35:14.279,00:35:20.285,"And although we'll all be helping you, the important thing to remember-- - Harriet?"
00:35:20.285,00:35:24.163,- ...is that you have to get the blame for everything.
00:35:24.163,00:35:26.959,- Run along.
00:35:26.959,00:35:28.209,Speaking.
00:35:28.209,00:35:29.502,"- Headphones on, girls."
00:35:31.880,00:35:34.800,"- Come on, everybody."
00:35:34.800,00:35:39.178,"We'll just jump in, have a quick paddle about, warm up, then have tea and crumpets, yes?"
00:35:39.178,00:35:42.849,"- Yes, I'm in school right now."
00:35:42.849,00:35:44.101,Regulation uniform?
00:35:44.101,00:35:46.645,Skirt just below the knee.
00:35:47.938,00:35:49.773,Of course.
00:35:49.773,00:35:53.902,They are simple polyester-- sturdy and practical.
00:35:53.902,00:35:57.072,"No, I have certainly not been naughty."
00:35:57.072,00:36:00.951,My disciplinary record is exemplary.
00:36:00.951,00:36:02.995,Are you okay?
00:36:05.038,00:36:08.792,- Get out!
00:36:30.856,00:36:31.982,"Uh, yes, thank-- thank you very much."
00:36:31.982,00:36:34.026,"That's it, thank you."
00:36:34.026,00:36:36.277,- If you make enough of a nuisance of yourself...
00:36:36.277,00:36:39.531,- Poppy... Moore!
00:36:39.531,00:36:43.702,"- ...she will eventually bow to pressure, and she'll have to call your father."
00:36:43.702,00:36:46.538,"- Naturally, I'll call her father, but she's had a difficult time."
00:36:46.538,00:36:48.081,"- No, Sara, please, it's all right."
00:36:48.081,00:36:49.958,- Mr. Nellist.
00:36:49.958,00:36:56.089,"- And then with any luck, she'll recommend you to the Honor Court."
00:36:56.089,00:36:59.968,- Unbe-bloody-lievable!
00:36:59.968,00:37:03.555,She's got more lives than a Buddhist cat.
00:37:03.555,00:37:06.766,Kingley's not even mentioned Honor Court.
00:37:06.766,00:37:08.560,- I think people are starting to like her.
00:37:08.560,00:37:10.311,- People?
00:37:10.311,00:37:15.358,"People can learn to get used to rotting pig's vomit, if they live with it for long enough."
00:37:15.358,00:37:17.235,- I believe she's trying to leave.
00:37:17.235,00:37:19.571,It'd be a nightmare if she stayed.
00:37:19.571,00:37:21.073,She makes a mockery of the system.
00:37:21.073,00:37:24.701,"- She's not staying, take it from me."
00:37:24.701,00:37:28.872,Five generations of my family have made the school great.
00:37:28.872,00:37:38.006,"The school motto is scholarship, fellowship, loyalty, not be a slutty, whorey, shit-brain."
00:37:38.006,00:37:40.967,"- So brillianté, Harriet."
00:37:47.306,00:37:50.060,- I'm only sorry it can't be something stronger.
00:37:50.060,00:37:52.812,- Cup of tea.
00:38:03.240,00:38:04.824,"- Quick, give me the tape."
00:38:07.119,00:38:08.954,Pull the button off.
00:38:08.954,00:38:10.163,"Oh, my God, there's a car."
00:38:10.163,00:38:11.289,- Get out.
00:38:27.346,00:38:29.808,"- Whoa. It's all right, Cerberus, it's only me."
00:38:29.808,00:38:31.476,- Who's Cerberus?
00:38:31.476,00:38:32.685,- The dog that guards the gates of hell.
00:38:38.399,00:38:42.361,"- Hurry up, or you'll disturb my girls."
00:38:46.199,00:38:47.366,- Huh?
00:38:51.537,00:38:53.206,"Sorry, terrible allergies."
00:38:58.170,00:39:00.005,"- Uh, sorry."
00:39:00.005,00:39:02.215,"Better an empty house than an angry tenant, right?"
00:39:02.215,00:39:04.342,- Hmph.
00:39:07.095,00:39:08.638,- I don't get it.
00:39:08.638,00:39:10.723,It's like you've got immunity.
00:39:10.723,00:39:13.059,Your dad's a mafia guy or something.
00:39:13.059,00:39:16.271,"- Yep, I'm the goddaughter."
00:39:16.271,00:39:19.398,"- Whatever it is, she's cutting you a lot of slack."
00:39:19.398,00:39:21.359,We need to up the ante.
00:39:21.359,00:39:25.404,"In fact, we need to focus on her big weakness."
00:39:26.948,00:39:28.825,"- Oh, my God, you have to snog Freddie."
00:39:28.825,00:39:30.994,- Snog?
00:39:30.994,00:39:32.245,What is that?
00:39:32.245,00:39:33.705,- It's English for make out.
00:39:33.705,00:39:35.748,- Mrs. Kingsley will go ballistic.
00:39:35.748,00:39:39.211,- And Harriet would have an absolute fit.
00:39:39.211,00:39:40.962,"- Well, that's a definite bonus."
00:39:40.962,00:39:42.047,- And he'll be at the social.
00:39:42.047,00:39:43.631,- Cool.
00:39:43.631,00:39:46.301,"- Just remember, the point is to get caught."
00:39:46.301,00:39:48.178,"- All right, so what's the deal with the social?"
00:39:48.178,00:39:50.471,- It's the school dance on Saturday night.
00:39:50.471,00:39:52.057,"- Traditionally, it's fancy dress."
00:39:52.057,00:39:55.434,This year it's movie magic.
00:39:55.434,00:40:00.606,"- But the only ones who bother to dress up are teachers, morons, and Harriet."
00:40:00.606,00:40:03.276,- I say we dress up fancy.
00:40:03.276,00:40:04.986,Real fancy.
00:40:04.986,00:40:07.697,- This mission needs to be planned precisely.
00:40:07.697,00:40:09.448,Kiki?
00:40:09.448,00:40:14.246,"- Okay. Operation Freedom, part two, step one."
00:40:14.246,00:40:16.206,Attract Freddie.
00:40:16.206,00:40:20.960,"Step one, subsection A, look the part."
00:40:20.960,00:40:25.757,"- Kiki, you're actually making something quite exciting sound like physics homework."
00:40:25.757,00:40:29.719,"Basically, we're going into town, and we're gonna get some killer outfits."
00:40:29.719,00:40:36.268,"- I want something that says elegant, but at the same time incredibly slutty and available."
00:40:36.268,00:40:40.105,"In fact, I'm not that bothered about elegance."
00:40:55.661,00:40:59.291,"- So, apparently, the key is to hook up with the headmistress' son."
00:40:59.291,00:41:03.002,"I'll do your trick, Rubes, swing my hips and giggle."
00:41:03.002,00:41:04.754,"- Oh, come on, Poppy, we're gonna miss the bus."
00:41:04.754,00:41:07.173,"- Don't forget to log off now, you ninny."
00:41:11.094,00:41:12.845,"- Everyone, sign out."
00:41:12.845,00:41:15.348,Remember you are representatives of the school.
00:41:15.348,00:41:17.267,"Sign your own name, come on."
00:41:17.267,00:41:19.894,"Poppy Moore, what are you wearing?"
00:41:19.894,00:41:23.189,"You are going to town, not appearing in a window in Amsterdam."
00:41:23.189,00:41:24.523,Change immediately.
00:41:24.523,00:41:26.109,- I don't have anything else.
00:41:26.109,00:41:29.321,"I thought you might be quite concerned by that attire, Matron."
00:41:29.321,00:41:34.033,"So we had a little look-see in lost property on our way here, didn't we?"
00:41:34.033,00:41:35.327,- We did.
00:41:37.287,00:41:43.626,"- It'll suit you, promise."
00:41:45.003,00:41:46.379,"- Arf, arf, arf."
00:41:46.379,00:41:48.214,- That's cute.
00:41:48.214,00:41:50.091,My grandma used to have a dog just like it.
00:41:50.091,00:41:53.678,"- Poppy, I think your jumper is the cat's pajamas."
00:42:02.395,00:42:05.357,"- Come on, girls, in you go, hurry up."
00:42:05.357,00:42:07.233,Upstairs to the seats.
00:42:13.198,00:42:14.573,Don't push.
00:42:14.573,00:42:15.658,Plenty of room.
00:42:15.658,00:42:16.909,"Come on, here we go."
00:42:16.909,00:42:19.620,- Poppy!
00:42:19.620,00:42:22.623,"- Poppy, jump!"
00:42:22.623,00:42:24.501,I can't find my sanitizer!
00:42:24.501,00:42:26.002,- You left it in the dorm!
00:42:26.002,00:42:27.086,"- Oh, my God, no!"
00:42:27.086,00:42:28.296,"Oh, my God!"
00:42:28.296,00:42:29.922,- Run!
00:42:33.968,00:42:35.011,- Ew!
00:42:35.011,00:42:36.095,- Ew!
00:42:41.434,00:42:43.102,"- Oh, my God, look."
00:43:08.336,00:43:11.423,- Oh.
00:43:11.423,00:43:15.218,- Ew. Gross.
00:43:15.218,00:43:16.553,Where are we going?
00:43:16.553,00:43:18.179,- To our favorite shop.
00:43:18.179,00:43:19.638,- Cancer research?
00:43:19.638,00:43:24.894,"- Girls, I'm all about finding a cure, but considering I flunked chemistry, I don't know how much help I'm gonna be."
00:43:24.894,00:43:29.357,"And BTW, which FYI means by the way, this is supposed to be shopping time."
00:43:29.357,00:43:31.859,- We're not gonna be doing the research.
00:43:31.859,00:43:33.486,This is a charity shop.
00:43:33.486,00:43:35.363,The money goes to charity.
00:43:35.363,00:43:37.240,"- Oh, I just had a heart palpitation."
00:43:37.240,00:43:41.536,"You guys are so adorable, but we need to look really hot for the social."
00:43:41.536,00:43:43.204,So let's go hit Oxford Street.
00:43:43.204,00:43:45.206,"- I take it you flunked geography, too."
00:43:45.206,00:43:47.500,"Oxford Street is in London, my friend."
00:43:47.500,00:43:51.003,This is your lot.
00:44:00.430,00:44:03.266,"- Hey, Kate, what about this for Ascot?"
00:44:03.266,00:44:04.892,- Magnificent.
00:44:04.892,00:44:07.645,- Is this too workaday?
00:44:09.439,00:44:12.484,"- Come on now, girls, this is a serious mission."
00:44:12.484,00:44:14.152,Get a move on.
00:44:14.152,00:44:16.279,"Now, Poppy, how about something like this?"
00:44:16.279,00:44:17.738,Fifty pence.
00:44:17.738,00:44:19.407,- It looks like someone died in it.
00:44:19.407,00:44:21.451,I'd rather stay the Yorkshire Terrier freak.
00:44:21.451,00:44:23.077,"- You're a Buddhist, right?"
00:44:23.077,00:44:25.913,Think of it as clothing reincarnation.
00:44:25.913,00:44:29.375,"- Honey, even Buddha wouldn't be caught dead in half this stuff."
00:44:29.375,00:44:30.918,"Still, I guess anything's possible."
00:44:30.918,00:44:34.547,"Come on, let's do this."
00:45:35.358,00:45:37.109,"- Unbelievable, this season Marni."
00:45:37.109,00:45:39.736,"It's sophisticated, it's elegant."
00:45:39.736,00:45:42.073,- Hot to trot.
00:45:43.700,00:45:48.371,"- If we could just call this stuff vintage and add like three zeroes to the price tag, I could totally get into it."
00:45:48.371,00:45:50.122,- Perfection.
00:45:50.122,00:45:52.584,Operation Freddie is well and truly underway.
00:45:52.584,00:45:54.001,- Malibu moment!
00:45:54.001,00:45:55.503,Remember what I taught you guys?
00:45:55.503,00:45:58.005,- Who are we?
00:45:59.424,00:46:01.593,- I think he's down a penny black.
00:46:01.593,00:46:03.511,"Yes, dated prewar."
00:46:04.970,00:46:08.516,"Oh, my God!"
00:46:08.516,00:46:10.059,- Would you like to say any louder?
00:46:10.059,00:46:11.936,I need your help.
00:46:11.936,00:46:15.732,"- And I need a back wax and a night with Michael Bublé, but we don't always get what we want."
00:46:15.732,00:46:17.900,"Trudy, attend to the brows."
00:46:17.900,00:46:19.736,Mmm. Yorkie fan.
00:46:19.736,00:46:21.820,"It's a nice dog, Yorkie."
00:46:21.820,00:46:22.821,I used to have one once.
00:46:22.821,00:46:24.616,Wee Phillippe.
00:46:24.616,00:46:26.618,Got savaged to death by a badger.
00:46:26.618,00:46:27.702,- Ow!
00:46:27.702,00:46:29.245,- Mm.
00:46:29.245,00:46:31.706,Aren't you the soufflé that didn't arise?
00:46:31.706,00:46:33.332,- Tell me about it.
00:46:33.332,00:46:37.670,"Okay, I need these extensions taken out, a serious deep conditioning."
00:46:37.670,00:46:41.798,"I'm thinking side bangs with some buttery highlights, and maybe a few honey tones."
00:46:41.798,00:46:45.886,"- Oh! And I'd like a night on Fireman Island, but I'm afraid I'm whistling Dixie, okay?"
00:46:45.886,00:46:48.431,"So, here's what's on offer for you."
00:46:48.431,00:46:49.724,A tight perm.
00:46:49.724,00:46:51.476,- No.
00:46:51.476,00:46:53.519,A wee bob.
00:46:53.519,00:46:54.895,- No.
00:46:54.895,00:46:57.189,What about this?
00:46:57.189,00:46:59.150,"Oh, Hawaii."
00:46:59.150,00:47:00.943,- No.
00:47:00.943,00:47:04.530,- What about something a little bit more natural?
00:47:04.530,00:47:06.324,Natural?
00:47:06.324,00:47:07.908,- Aye. The real you.
00:47:07.908,00:47:09.034,- Hmm.
00:47:10.662,00:47:12.121,Natural it is.
00:47:12.121,00:47:13.623,- Radical.
00:47:13.623,00:47:16.417,"- Okay, ladies, let's do this."
00:47:18.711,00:47:22.006,"All right, I'll need that, that, that."
00:47:22.006,00:47:24.300,Mm.
00:47:25.968,00:47:28.680,"Oh, oh! Oh, no."
00:47:28.680,00:47:29.972,Look it. Mmm.
00:47:29.972,00:47:32.809,That's not mine.
00:47:32.809,00:47:35.520,"Hey, Mommy, two strong teas, please."
00:47:35.520,00:47:36.771,Bella pronto.
00:47:38.147,00:47:39.357,Don't you look at me like that.
00:47:42.694,00:47:44.028,Nix that.
00:47:45.571,00:47:47.281,"You ready, hen?"
00:47:47.281,00:47:48.366,- Um-hm.
00:47:50.867,00:47:52.704,Et voila.
00:47:52.704,00:47:53.996,Thank you.
00:47:53.996,00:47:55.331,"- Oh, you're welcome, darling."
00:47:55.331,00:47:56.915,I'm cream-crackered.
00:47:56.915,00:47:59.627,I'll lay down and have a wee Satsuma.
00:47:59.627,00:48:02.714,- You look so-- - English.
00:48:02.714,00:48:04.549,- I look like my mom.
00:48:04.549,00:48:06.718,"- Is she beautiful, too?"
00:48:06.718,00:48:09.094,- She was very.
00:48:09.094,00:48:12.431,- Sorry.
00:48:14.975,00:48:16.728,"- Okay, time for the juice."
00:48:16.728,00:48:18.229,Any bright ideas?
00:48:18.229,00:48:19.647,"- Leave it to me, I've got a plan."
00:48:25.236,00:48:29.657,"- So, Susan, do you like your new office?"
00:48:29.657,00:48:35.663,"- I don't know what's worse, my job or that husband of mine."
00:48:35.663,00:48:38.666,- Keith from accounts is driving me crazy.
00:48:38.666,00:48:42.919,He wants that report on his desk by Thursday.
00:48:42.919,00:48:45.757,- What's the report about?
00:48:45.757,00:48:50.511,"- Oh, um, business."
00:48:50.511,00:48:52.179,- What?
00:48:52.179,00:48:55.140,- Do you want to buy a carpet tomorrow?
00:48:55.140,00:49:00.897,"- Yes, after I've dropped the kids off at the pool..."
00:49:00.897,00:49:03.274,...in my saloon car.
00:49:04.275,00:49:08.362,"Two bottles of Grizinksy and one of Donmatsa, please."
00:49:09.697,00:49:11.948,"- Oh, and two crème eggs, please."
00:49:16.662,00:49:19.707,"- Why did you order the crème eggs, you idiot?"
00:49:19.707,00:49:21.083,"- Why did you only get two, Drippy?"
00:49:21.083,00:49:22.627,Now we've got to quarter them?
00:49:22.627,00:49:23.795,- He believed us till then.
00:49:23.795,00:49:25.630,"- Oh, yeah, right."
00:49:25.630,00:49:27.757,Maybe if you hadn't asked me what Keith's report was about.
00:49:27.757,00:49:29.174,Where's Poppy?
00:49:29.174,00:49:31.385,- Are you okay?
00:49:31.385,00:49:32.845,Stupid Drippy.
00:49:32.845,00:49:34.639,- I know.
00:49:44.690,00:49:46.609,- Would you boys like a drink?
00:49:46.609,00:49:48.360,"Now, anybody here."
00:49:48.360,00:49:50.237,Come on.
00:49:52.698,00:49:54.074,- Hi.
00:49:54.074,00:49:57.119,Name's Nellist.
00:49:57.119,00:49:59.455,Licensed to DJ.
00:50:00.832,00:50:04.251,"- Gosh, you look like James Bond."
00:50:04.251,00:50:05.795,I thought you might like a fruit punch.
00:50:05.795,00:50:08.464,"- Oh, I'll have it shaken and not stirred."
00:50:11.676,00:50:12.885,"Oh, right."
00:50:12.885,00:50:14.679,- Why aren't you dancing?
00:50:14.679,00:50:16.305,"They're all dressed up, waiting for you over there."
00:50:18.140,00:50:21.727,- Mr. Nellis-- - Harriet's coming.
00:50:21.727,00:50:23.604,"- Right. Yes, yes."
00:50:43.624,00:50:44.834,- Mr. Darcy?
00:50:46.669,00:50:49.421,What undue pleasure it is to be afforded your company.
00:50:49.421,00:50:50.882,- Hi.
00:50:50.882,00:50:58.138,"- You may only call me Mrs. Darcy when you're completely, perfectly, incandescently happy."
00:50:58.138,00:50:59.932,- Okay. Cool.
00:50:59.932,00:51:02.768,- Freddie...
00:51:02.768,00:51:04.020,...it's me.
00:51:04.020,00:51:05.938,"- Of course, Harriet."
00:51:10.776,00:51:13.278,"- Okay, Poppy, let's get Freddie."
00:51:34.926,00:51:39.430,"- Lips, hips, hips, and butt."
00:51:39.430,00:51:40.514,- Whoo!
00:51:47.855,00:51:49.941,- Hi.
00:51:49.941,00:51:51.901,I like your hair.
00:51:51.901,00:51:53.235,- What are you doing?
00:51:53.235,00:51:59.742,"This is a themed costume party, not a dwarf prostitutes' convention."
00:51:59.742,00:52:01.201,- I'm so sorry.
00:52:01.201,00:52:02.954,I must say that you look incredible.
00:52:02.954,00:52:04.038,You make an excellent Shrek.
00:52:05.497,00:52:07.332,"This is my favorite song, come on."
00:53:08.019,00:53:09.353,"- Go, girlfriend!"
00:53:09.353,00:53:11.522,That is entirely wicked.
00:53:18.029,00:53:19.530,- Oh!
00:53:21.699,00:53:23.034,"- Hey, are you okay?"
00:53:23.034,00:53:24.952,"- Oh, you're awesome."
00:53:24.952,00:53:27.579,- She okay?
00:53:27.579,00:53:29.498,You can be sick in my hands if you'd like.
00:53:29.498,00:53:31.083,- She's acting like she's drunk.
00:53:31.083,00:53:33.002,She should be taken to bed.
00:53:33.002,00:53:34.712,- Freddie can do the honors.
00:53:34.712,00:53:37.255,- You really are a horridious piece of work.
00:53:37.255,00:53:38.924,- Mr. Darcy don't think so.
00:53:38.924,00:53:40.216,- She's just a little concussed.
00:53:40.216,00:53:41.177,She just needs some air.
00:53:41.177,00:53:43.345,- Great idea.
00:53:43.345,00:53:44.471,- Come on.
00:53:46.140,00:53:47.892,- Ugh!
00:53:47.892,00:53:49.977,She's up to something.
00:53:49.977,00:53:52.146,Follow them.
00:53:52.146,00:53:54.439,"- So, explain yourself, Miss Moore."
00:53:54.439,00:53:59.695,"- I'm afraid I can't explain myself, sir, because I'm not myself right now you see."
00:53:59.695,00:54:02.406,- Said Alice to the caterpillar.
00:54:02.406,00:54:04.491,"- You're right, how'd you know?"
00:54:04.491,00:54:06.160,- I was Alice in the school play.
00:54:06.160,00:54:09.705,All boys before you look at me weirdly.
00:54:11.582,00:54:13.167,Hey.
00:54:13.167,00:54:16.045,- You so don't need to play hard to get.
00:54:16.045,00:54:17.796,I'm totally into you.
00:54:17.796,00:54:20.091,"- Hey, come on."
00:54:20.091,00:54:21.592,Calm down.
00:54:21.592,00:54:25.303,"- Okay, leading lady, all-boys school, awkward with intimacy."
00:54:25.303,00:54:27.765,Cards on the table.
00:54:27.765,00:54:28.974,Are you gay?
00:54:30.101,00:54:31.393,"Uh, just English."
00:54:31.393,00:54:33.353,And I am sober and sensible.
00:54:33.353,00:54:38.400,"And you, my sweet friend, are overexcited and concussed."
00:54:38.400,00:54:43.072,"I go back to school tomorrow, but I'll be back on the 18th."
00:54:43.072,00:54:44.156,How about I see you then?
00:54:44.156,00:54:46.075,- Okay.
00:54:46.075,00:54:48.077,- I'll make a deal.
00:54:48.077,00:54:49.578,No more head-fry behavior.
00:54:49.578,00:54:51.371,I sense that might be your forte.
00:54:51.371,00:54:55.084,"- I won't fry your head, if you don't poach my heart."
00:54:56.961,00:54:58.087,- Deal.
00:54:59.671,00:55:01.632,"- Oh, crap."
00:55:01.632,00:55:08.264,"- Fraternizing with the girls, Freddy Kingsley, as you are well aware, is not allowed."
00:55:08.264,00:55:11.058,"- Poppy Moore, get back inside."
00:55:11.058,00:55:12.184,Immediately.
00:55:19.942,00:55:21.317,- Tell Harriet.
00:55:21.317,00:55:28.075,"- She won't just shoot the messenger, she'll skin us alive first."
00:55:28.075,00:55:30.077,Me think not.
00:55:30.077,00:55:32.037,- We think not.
00:55:32.037,00:55:33.122,- Oh.
00:55:34.206,00:55:35.916,"Nice work, Kate."
00:55:35.916,00:55:39.335,"- So, is Operation Freddie well and truly underway?"
00:55:39.335,00:55:41.297,- God knows?
00:55:41.297,00:55:44.340,So it just depends on whether Tweedledum or Tweedledee decide to tell her.
00:55:44.340,00:55:45.676,- There's nothing to worry about.
00:55:45.676,00:55:47.678,- Clearly not.
00:55:47.678,00:55:51.473,We're gonna have to come up with an addendum to Plan B.
00:55:51.473,00:55:55.519,- Isn't it ironic how my ticket out of here just might be the reason I wanna stay?
00:55:55.519,00:55:57.980,"I mean, one of the reasons, anyways."
00:55:57.980,00:55:59.439,- Someone call Al Gore.
00:55:59.439,00:56:01.192,I think the ice queen is melting.
00:56:01.192,00:56:03.194,- What an excellent night.
00:56:03.194,00:56:07.363,Eight boys have actually come up and directly spoken to me.
00:56:07.363,00:56:11.202,"- Now, for all you lovers out there."
00:56:11.202,00:56:13.037,It's your final chance.
00:56:13.037,00:56:16.207,It's the last dance.
00:56:16.207,00:56:18.209,- Come on!
00:56:21.628,00:56:23.297,- There's something I have to tell you.
00:56:23.297,00:56:26.091,"- Oh, we already know."
00:56:26.091,00:56:27.218,You wax your bum.
00:56:27.218,00:56:28.719,- No.
00:56:28.719,00:56:31.263,"Not quite, but similar ballpark."
00:56:31.263,00:56:33.182,"- You haven't done it, have you?"
00:56:33.182,00:56:40.856,"- No. I mean, I couldn't admit it back home, so I kind of lied, but I'm a total nun."
00:56:40.856,00:56:42.858,- Welcome to the nunnery.
00:56:50.157,00:56:52.034,"- Come on, girls."
00:56:52.034,00:56:54.745,"If we lose today, we're out of the championship again."
00:57:02.669,00:57:05.256,- Perhaps you'd like to explain last night to me.
00:57:05.256,00:57:07.423,Kate?
00:57:08.675,00:57:10.302,- I'm sorry.
00:57:10.302,00:57:12.346,We just got a little bit carried away.
00:57:12.346,00:57:20.645,"- Well, as I understand it, Drippy got totally carried away by Mr. Nellist and Miss Rees- Withers, after she lay in a pool of her own vomit."
00:57:20.645,00:57:23.732,"- Actually, it was Kate's vomit, Mrs. Kingsley."
00:57:23.732,00:57:26.110,I was just lying in it.
00:57:27.361,00:57:29.071,- I expect better of you two.
00:57:29.071,00:57:31.489,You know the values we stand for at Abbey Mount.
00:57:31.489,00:57:38.205,"And as for you, Poppy, I don't know whether to be pleased that you've finally made some friends here or furious that you've led them astray."
00:57:39.290,00:57:40.582,Dismissed.
00:57:45.337,00:57:47.298,"Not you, Miss Moore."
00:57:49.174,00:57:55.764,"I gave your father my word that I'd try and help you, but I'll be honest, you're making it awfully difficult."
00:57:55.764,00:57:59.517,"You're cleverer and better than this, Poppy."
00:57:59.517,00:58:02.271,Why don't you give yourself a chance?
00:58:02.271,00:58:03.355,Try.
00:58:03.355,00:58:05.316,Try at something.
00:58:05.316,00:58:08.860,Show him that you can rise to the occasion.
00:58:08.860,00:58:12.823,"Because, judging by the outfits you created last night, when you put your mind to something you can do it."
00:58:15.326,00:58:19.288,Don't give up on yourself.
00:58:19.288,00:58:22.707,Because I haven't and neither has your father.
00:58:24.626,00:58:26.378,Now off you go.
00:58:29.340,00:58:33.885,"- Ugh, I really do feel sick."
00:58:33.885,00:58:36.763,- What did she want?
00:58:36.763,00:58:39.433,Just a good spa destination.
00:58:53.364,00:58:55.366,"Come on, guys!"
00:58:55.366,00:58:56.950,- Come on!
00:59:02.664,00:59:04.166,"- Oh, God, I feel really vile."
00:59:04.166,00:59:06.001,I think I'm gonna puke.
00:59:06.001,00:59:07.585,"Seriously, Poppy, you're gonna have to take my place."
00:59:07.585,00:59:10.047,- There's only seven minutes left.
00:59:11.382,00:59:13.091,"Oh, cripes!"
00:59:13.091,00:59:14.426,Um...
00:59:14.426,00:59:15.802,Poppy can take my place.
00:59:15.802,00:59:20.098,"- Don't worry, Miss Rees-Withers, we'll play one man down."
00:59:20.098,00:59:21.975,We don't want to carry dead weight.
00:59:21.975,00:59:23.060,No offense.
00:59:23.060,00:59:25.020,"- Oh, none taken."
00:59:25.020,00:59:29.774,"But seeing as how you don't want me playing on your team, well, I'm friggin' playing."
00:59:31.402,00:59:33.070,- Ugh!
00:59:33.070,00:59:34.654,- Into the bucket.
00:59:34.654,00:59:36.532,"- Josie, on the wing!"
00:59:36.532,00:59:38.492,- All right.
00:59:38.492,00:59:41.870,Let's just pretend the ball is the last size five pair of Manolos at Barney's.
00:59:43.247,00:59:44.498,Okay.
00:59:45.623,00:59:46.666,Let's pull it out the bag.
00:59:46.666,00:59:48.085,"Offense, yeah!"
00:59:48.085,00:59:49.086,Eyes on the prize.
00:59:49.086,00:59:50.504,"Aah, Josie!"
00:59:50.504,00:59:52.589,Eye on the prize.
00:59:52.589,00:59:54.132,"Josie, help!"
00:59:54.132,00:59:55.717,"- Poppy, roll over it or pick it up!"
00:59:57.469,00:59:59.137,- Yeah!
00:59:59.137,01:00:00.264,Dunk that bitch.
01:00:00.264,01:00:01.723,"You see the goal, Josie."
01:00:01.723,01:00:06.103,"Focus, focus."
01:00:21.659,01:00:35.006,"- And, finally, in news that's shocking as the fall of the Berlin wall, our under-18 Lacrosse team has gone through to the second round of the county championships for the first time since 1976."
01:00:38.594,01:00:44.266,"To sign up for extra practice, please see Harriet B-- Oh, my apologies."
01:00:44.266,01:00:47.478,"No, it seems you should see Poppy Moore."
01:00:50.397,01:00:54.943,"All right, people, choose a goal buddy."
01:00:54.943,01:00:59.490,"From now on, each sentence starts with I will, not I want to."
01:00:59.490,01:01:04.161,- I will want to saliva vomit if we have to call each other buddy.
01:01:04.161,01:01:05.203,- Shut up.
01:01:05.203,01:01:06.704,Hit it.
01:01:06.704,01:01:08.165,I'm giving us an aggression makeover.
01:01:09.666,01:01:11.502,"Go, go, go!"
01:01:11.502,01:01:12.752,Who is that?
01:01:12.752,01:01:14.087,"Kiki, get it, get it."
01:01:14.087,01:01:15.506,"Oh, that's okay."
01:01:15.506,01:01:16.923,Scoop it.
01:01:16.923,01:01:18.509,"Come on, faster, faster, faster!"
01:01:18.509,01:01:20.177,This is ridiculous.
01:01:20.177,01:01:21.719,"Come on, play like you mean it, baby, try."
01:01:21.719,01:01:23.180,Call the ball.
01:01:23.180,01:01:25.223,Mine. I got it.
01:01:25.223,01:01:26.766,"- Come on, Josie."
01:01:26.766,01:01:28.810,- Pass the ball.
01:01:30.770,01:01:38.529,"- Congratulations, once again, to our under-18 Lacrosse team who beat Bodley Girls on Saturday, five-two."
01:01:38.529,01:01:40.030,Well done.
01:01:43.659,01:01:45.785,"- Come on, you guys!"
01:01:45.785,01:01:47.621,"Come on, shake it, Kiki."
01:01:47.621,01:01:49.331,"Come on, come on!"
01:01:49.331,01:01:50.415,What is this?
01:01:55.379,01:01:56.463,Whoo!
01:02:01.968,01:02:03.512,"Good, come on."
01:02:03.512,01:02:05.138,"Quicker, quicker, quicker, quicker."
01:02:06.557,01:02:08.392,"Josie, come on!"
01:02:08.392,01:02:09.560,"- Kiki, go!"
01:02:09.560,01:02:11.395,"- Shoot, Kiki, shoot!"
01:02:11.395,01:02:17.859,- And the groundbreaking news is that Abbey Mount is through to the lacrosse championship finals.
01:02:17.859,01:02:21.321,"- Dear Ruby, today is my big date with the headmistress' son, Freddie."
01:02:21.321,01:02:22.947,Wish me luck.
01:02:22.947,01:02:24.616,I may be out of here before you know it.
01:02:24.616,01:02:26.493,- Lover boy's waiting outside for you.
01:02:31.748,01:02:34.585,"But, remember, you want someone to catch you out."
01:02:34.585,01:02:36.712,So stay near school and good luck.
01:02:36.712,01:02:40.257,Thanks.
01:02:57.148,01:02:58.900,"Ah, Freddie Kingsley."
01:02:58.900,01:03:01.819,"Nice to finally see you when I'm not delirious or, uh, half-naked."
01:03:01.819,01:03:03.447,- Don't speak too soon.
01:03:03.447,01:03:06.575,And is it wrong for me to say that I'm just a tiny bit disappointed?
01:03:06.575,01:03:08.619,"Come on, trouble, let's hit the road."
01:03:08.619,01:03:12.247,"- Hey, I thought maybe we could take a romantic stroll around the school grounds."
01:03:12.247,01:03:13.790,- Ha ha!
01:03:13.790,01:03:15.166,And get caught?
01:03:15.166,01:03:19.003,"Call me old-fashioned, but I actually do quite like living."
01:03:24.134,01:03:25.969,I thought you said you could drive.
01:03:25.969,01:03:28.639,- It's not my fault your stupid car doesn't work.
01:03:28.639,01:03:30.599,- Have you ever thought of changing gears?
01:03:30.599,01:03:32.768,- That's the car's job.
01:03:32.768,01:03:34.770,- Turn right here.
01:03:34.770,01:03:36.480,We drive on the left in this country.
01:03:36.480,01:03:38.315,- Whatever.
01:04:00.671,01:04:03.173,- And so I threw the whole lot over the cliff.
01:04:03.173,01:04:05.967,"My dad went mental, as Drippy would say."
01:04:05.967,01:04:11.264,"Drippy said I was crazy, but Kate said she would have done exactly the same in my position."
01:04:11.264,01:04:13.809,"Sorry, chattering away like this."
01:04:13.809,01:04:15.519,Feel free to shut me up.
01:04:15.519,01:04:18.355,"- Well, remind me to never to get on your bad side."
01:04:18.355,01:04:20.940,But the thing is...
01:04:20.940,01:04:24.277,...I'm pretty sure you don't have one.
01:04:39.501,01:04:40.877,"- Here you go, trouble."
01:04:40.877,01:04:44.297,- Bread and fries-- that's my treat?
01:04:44.297,01:04:49.803,"- If I affect your life in no other way, allow this honor-- The humble chip butty."
01:04:49.803,01:04:52.305,Here we go.
01:04:59.646,01:05:03.358,"- Kinda gross, but, um, I like it."
01:05:03.358,01:05:05.485,- Here.
01:05:07.945,01:05:17.706,- You know this is one of the dates-- The best date I've ever had.
01:05:17.706,01:05:21.292,- There's something about you Poppy Moore.
01:05:21.292,01:05:24.003,"Every moment I'm with you, I catch my breath."
01:05:58.663,01:06:00.791,"- Guys, guess what?"
01:06:00.791,01:06:02.292,You'll never believe it.
01:06:03.794,01:06:05.629,What happened?
01:06:05.629,01:06:11.008,"- Dear Ruby, you cannot imagine how retarded these idiots are."
01:06:11.008,01:06:16.097,They're a bunch of ugly losers who think a mani-pedi is a Latin greeting.
01:06:16.097,01:06:21.185," I despise these village idiots, but I have to pretend to like them so they'll help me get out of this hell hole."
01:06:21.185,01:06:24.063,"I tried doing it on my own, and it was impossible."
01:06:28.610,01:06:34.866,"- Still they're so sick, they'll never realize I'll be out of this asylum by the end of term."
01:06:36.117,01:06:37.911,- I didn't write that.
01:06:37.911,01:06:39.454,I mean hardly any of it-- just the loser part.
01:06:39.454,01:06:40.538,But that was weeks ago.
01:06:40.538,01:06:43.875,"- Well, it's dated today and it's from your e-mail address."
01:06:43.875,01:06:45.209,- Where did you get it?
01:06:45.209,01:06:46.795,- It was taped to the door.
01:06:46.795,01:06:50.507,- You're a seriously horridious cow.
01:06:51.967,01:06:54.886,"- Come on, guys, you have to believe me."
01:06:54.886,01:06:56.888,"- Just forget it, okay?"
01:06:56.888,01:06:58.723,- Why would you do that?
01:06:58.723,01:07:01.685,- You can't believe I actually wrote this.
01:07:01.685,01:07:06.648,"- All we did was try to make your life here happier, Poppy."
01:07:06.648,01:07:09.693,I thought we were friends.
01:07:17.993,01:07:22.831,"- So, all I have to do is hook up with the headmistress' son, and it's sure thing that they expel me."
01:07:22.831,01:07:24.791,He's a total English dweeb.
01:07:24.791,01:07:26.877,"Pretty gross, but an easy target."
01:07:26.877,01:07:28.712,Give me a week tops.
01:07:33.717,01:07:34.801,I can explain.
01:07:47.230,01:07:49.232,"Please, I really need to talk to you."
01:07:49.232,01:07:50.692,- I can't right now.
01:07:50.692,01:07:53.486,"You know the limo's coming in five, and I have nada to wear."
01:07:53.486,01:07:54.988,- Where are you going?
01:07:54.988,01:07:57.407,"Oh, not the Jimmy Choos."
01:07:57.407,01:07:59.534,"They don't match, for Christ's sake."
01:07:59.534,01:08:01.036,"- Rubes, I just need some advice."
01:08:01.036,01:08:02.913,Something really bad has happened.
01:08:02.913,01:08:06.332,"- Oh, crap, fashion emergency."
01:08:06.332,01:08:08.919,"Gotta go, see you soon as."
01:08:08.919,01:08:10.003,I love you.
01:08:10.003,01:08:12.547,- I love you more.
01:08:14.049,01:08:16.634,"- Sorry, Roddy, couldn't get rid of her."
01:08:16.634,01:08:17.928,What was I saying?
01:08:17.928,01:08:21.014,Roddy?
01:08:21.014,01:08:25.142,"- No, Ruby, still me, babe."
01:09:00.053,01:09:02.055,Shit!
01:09:03.974,01:09:05.516,Shit!
01:09:48.852,01:09:50.436,"- Kate, Kate, quick!"
01:09:50.436,01:09:52.271,"- Wake up, wake up!"
01:09:52.271,01:09:53.564,"- I didn't mean to do it, It was an accident."
01:09:53.564,01:09:54.983,I thought I put it out.
01:09:54.983,01:09:56.317,I-- I thought I'd stopped it.
01:09:56.317,01:09:57.694,I don't know what happened.
01:09:57.694,01:09:59.236,I didn't want to hurt anybody.
01:09:59.236,01:10:00.989,"- Jesus, Poppy, you're a proper psycho."
01:10:00.989,01:10:02.782,- Help me get everyone out before it spreads.
01:10:02.782,01:10:04.034,"- Josie. Josie, get up."
01:10:04.034,01:10:06.036,"Josie, there's a fire!"
01:10:08.538,01:10:10.331,"- Fire, fire!"
01:10:10.331,01:10:12.333,Fire!
01:10:12.333,01:10:13.710,Get out of bed!
01:10:13.710,01:10:15.045,It's a fire!
01:10:15.045,01:10:16.295,"Guys, get up!"
01:10:16.295,01:10:17.839,"- Come on, darling get up."
01:10:17.839,01:10:20.466,"It's a fire, it's not a drill."
01:10:25.513,01:10:27.390,- Joise!
01:10:27.390,01:10:29.100,Get up!
01:10:29.100,01:10:31.686,- It's a real fire!
01:10:38.068,01:10:40.070,- Phoebe Faircloff.
01:10:40.070,01:10:42.072,- Susan Casey.
01:10:42.072,01:10:45.783,- Let me out!
01:10:53.833,01:10:56.252,- Daisy Bevin?
01:10:56.252,01:10:58.213,- Can't hear you. Daisy?
01:11:04.301,01:11:07.555,- Jennifer Logan?
01:11:07.555,01:11:09.974,Jennifer?
01:11:09.974,01:11:11.809,Has anyone seen Drippy?
01:11:11.809,01:11:13.352,"Come on, girls."
01:11:13.352,01:11:14.896,Who was the last person to see Drippy?
01:11:14.896,01:11:18.566,- The freezer.
01:11:21.986,01:11:23.320,"- Hey, stop her!"
01:11:31.204,01:11:34.707,- Drippy! Drippy!
01:11:36.126,01:11:38.294,Drippy!
01:11:42.090,01:11:43.967,- What's going on?
01:12:17.458,01:12:18.668,- What do you think happened?
01:12:18.668,01:12:20.211,- Don't know yet.
01:12:20.211,01:12:23.173,"We're lucky, could've been a lot worse."
01:12:31.639,01:12:34.142,"- Well done, Poppy, you saved us."
01:12:34.142,01:12:36.769,- You're brilliant.
01:12:42.275,01:12:45.361,- Hey.
01:12:45.361,01:12:47.780,- Thank you.
01:12:47.780,01:12:49.615,- Do you realize you could've killed her?
01:12:49.615,01:12:51.201,"- Well done, thanks, Poppy."
01:12:51.201,01:12:52.285,- You could've killed all of us.
01:12:52.285,01:12:54.078,- I didn't mean to.
01:12:54.078,01:12:56.164,"I thought I'd stopped it, I swear."
01:12:56.164,01:12:58.124,"I don't understand, okay?"
01:12:58.124,01:13:01.127,"I heard footsteps, and then I put it out."
01:13:01.127,01:13:05.965,"I was just so upset at everything, and I wish I hadn't have done it."
01:13:05.965,01:13:09.468,"- I really wish you hadn't done it, too."
01:13:14.640,01:13:18.602,- Someone here knows exactly what happened last night.
01:13:20.396,01:13:25.068,What we're clear on is that this fire was no accident.
01:13:25.068,01:13:29.072,"If you have the sense to own up, no legal charges will be filed."
01:13:29.072,01:13:34.160,"If not, it will be passed on to the local authorities."
01:13:34.160,01:13:40.416,You have until the end of the day to come forward.
01:14:08.319,01:14:12.531,"- Dear Freddie, How can I begin to say I'm sorry?"
01:14:12.531,01:14:16.244,You are good and honest and true.
01:14:16.244,01:14:18.871,"And, well, I'm the opposite."
01:14:18.871,01:14:21.165,But I'm learning.
01:14:21.165,01:14:23.293,"So, now, I'm going to do the right thing."
01:14:23.293,01:14:30.883,"And if it means I have to leave here, I just want you to know I promise you I never wrote that e-mail."
01:14:30.883,01:14:36.097,"For a moment, there, yeah, you were my ticket out of here, but then I got to know you."
01:14:36.097,01:14:42.019,"I have never felt this way before about anyone, and I really need you to know that."
01:14:51.195,01:14:53.530,- Come in.
01:14:53.530,01:14:57.327,"Oh, what can I do for you, Poppy?"
01:15:00.913,01:15:03.374,- It's what I used to start it.
01:15:03.374,01:15:07.003,"It was an accident, and, uh, I thought I put it out."
01:15:07.003,01:15:09.297,But I guess not.
01:15:09.297,01:15:11.882,Obviously not.
01:15:11.882,01:15:14.593,"- Oh, Poppy."
01:15:14.593,01:15:18.639,"You realize what this means, don't you?"
01:15:20.766,01:15:22.226,- Will I be expelled?
01:15:22.226,01:15:28.316,"- The Honor Court will decide, but I suspect you'll understand that it's just a formality at this point."
01:15:28.316,01:15:34.364,- The weird thing is I really did try to turn it around.
01:15:34.364,01:15:37.325,I didn't want to disappoint you.
01:15:37.325,01:15:40.244,I'm so sorry.
01:15:43.539,01:15:45.833,"- I'm so sorry, too, Poppy."
01:15:45.833,01:15:51.755,"- Uh, do you think maybe you could give this to Freddie for me?"
01:16:07.438,01:16:09.273,I told her it was me.
01:16:09.273,01:16:12.109,I'm going to the Honor Court and then I'll be leaving.
01:16:12.109,01:16:13.194,"So, this is for you."
01:16:14.487,01:16:15.821,- Well done.
01:16:15.821,01:16:17.698,You finally got what you wanted.
01:16:17.698,01:16:19.409,You must be overjoyed.
01:16:19.409,01:16:21.994,- I couldn't be more unhappy.
01:16:21.994,01:16:25.331,"- Oh, please, give it a rest."
01:17:04.370,01:17:06.372,- Mom?
01:17:31.647,01:17:34.275,"- Hey, I've been looking for you."
01:17:34.275,01:17:36.611,- Hi.
01:17:36.611,01:17:38.488,"- So, you're backed out of our deal."
01:17:38.488,01:17:41.449,- What deal?
01:17:41.449,01:17:44.160,- That you wouldn't fry my head.
01:17:44.160,01:17:45.869,- Yeah.
01:17:45.869,01:17:47.580,But you poached my heart.
01:17:47.580,01:17:50.583,"Hey, come on."
01:17:53.710,01:17:55.630,What if it doesn't have a moral?
01:17:55.630,01:17:57.840,Or says Alice.
01:17:57.840,01:18:01.511,- I think I just fell down the rabbit hole and found it.
01:18:01.511,01:18:03.179,Look.
01:18:06.932,01:18:08.725,- She looks exactly like you.
01:18:08.725,01:18:12.396,- Yeah.
01:18:12.396,01:18:14.690,She went to this school.
01:18:14.690,01:18:17.776,I didn't even know.
01:18:23.616,01:18:27.703,"Well, I guess it's time to face the music now."
01:18:40.216,01:18:42.801,"- Josie, I'm never wrong."
01:18:42.801,01:18:44.345,- You're wrong when we did the math challenge.
01:18:44.345,01:18:45.929,- Hey!
01:18:45.929,01:18:48.807,She's going to Honor Court this afternoon.
01:18:48.807,01:18:49.933,- That's brave.
01:18:49.933,01:18:51.435,- And really stupid.
01:18:51.435,01:18:53.854,- Because guess what I've discovered.
01:18:53.854,01:18:59.068,- It is with great regret and sadness that we call the Honor Court to session.
01:19:01.654,01:19:04.781,- The e-mails were sent 11:40 in the morning.
01:19:04.781,01:19:09.786,"But, according to Drippy, Poppy left the computer room a few minutes after 11:00."
01:19:09.786,01:19:13.207,"I got my 11:00 Wagon Wheel, and then I went to tell her that Freddie was waiting."
01:19:13.207,01:19:14.833,She left immediately.
01:19:14.833,01:19:21.215,I was able to access the keystroke order of the root file to find out who else was logged on there then.
01:19:21.215,01:19:24.260,And guess who the only other person was?
01:19:24.260,01:19:26.220,- Who?
01:19:26.220,01:19:33.269,- It will henceforth be our job to objectively and dispassionately ascertain what happened that fateful night.
01:19:33.269,01:19:39.275,That will hence to forth long blight the memory of this proud institution.
01:19:39.275,01:19:41.777,"- When you think about it, Poppy would never say term."
01:19:41.777,01:19:44.488,She calls it a bloody samosa or something.
01:19:44.488,01:19:46.073,- Semester.
01:19:46.073,01:19:52.538,"Anyway, to check the reality, I had a sneaky look in her diary for Friday's entry."
01:19:52.538,01:19:53.706,- Don't do that.
01:19:53.706,01:19:55.916,- Shut up and listen.
01:19:55.916,01:20:02.172,"I think, deep breath, I kind of love them like proper friends I've known forever."
01:20:02.172,01:20:09.513,"They've made me say words like 'horridious' and 'herbal.' Which is sort of whack, and I'd probably hate them if I wasn't one of them."
01:20:09.513,01:20:13.934,But I like that I'm now one of them.
01:20:13.934,01:20:20.483,"Apart from some atrocious spelling mistakes, it's a little bit more kosher, don't you think?"
01:20:22.526,01:20:24.111,- And now she's gonna get thrown out.
01:20:26.029,01:20:34.371,- It is your duty to understand the dark forces that drove a seemingly-- - Harriet.
01:20:34.371,01:20:38.459,May I remind you that the Honor Court is no place for your personal grandstanding.
01:20:38.459,01:20:42.755,"Look, Poppy has a right to speak in her own defense before the court, as a whole, passes judgment."
01:20:42.755,01:20:45.966,"- Thank you, Mrs. Kingsley."
01:20:45.966,01:20:51.639,I won't insult everybody by trying to defend myself or my actions.
01:20:57.645,01:21:06.737,"So, uh, I think it's safe to say that I've-- I've really messed up, and I apologize profusely."
01:21:06.737,01:21:10.616,But I'm also so grateful to you all.
01:21:10.616,01:21:13.619,I tried really hard to get out of this school.
01:21:13.619,01:21:19.583,"And, only now, do I realize just how much I want to stay."
01:21:19.583,01:21:24.630,"I've learned so much being here, being with all of you."
01:21:24.630,01:21:32.513,"And, in some ways, being with my mom, who I found out was actually a student here."
01:21:34.097,01:21:41.188,"I've had a hole in my heart for five years, and somehow being here, it slowly started to heal."
01:21:41.188,01:21:51.156,"I know I may have looked like a California girl, but in my heart I've discovered that I really am an Abbey Mount girl."
01:21:54.951,01:21:57.246,- Objection!
01:21:57.246,01:22:00.332,The court will heretofore disregard the previous statement.
01:22:00.332,01:22:03.669,And perhaps heretofore we can begin the real business.
01:22:03.669,01:22:12.762,"Can you tell us, in your own words, where were you on the aforementioned evening of-- - Honestly, Harriet, who else's words do you expect her to use?"
01:22:12.762,01:22:14.638,Just leave this to me.
01:22:14.638,01:22:15.806,- Right.
01:22:16.766,01:22:18.768,Sustained.
01:22:18.768,01:22:22.605,"- Poppy, were you in the cook's sitting room on the night of the fire?"
01:22:22.605,01:22:23.980,"- Yes, I was."
01:22:23.980,01:22:26.609,- Were you there with permission?
01:22:26.609,01:22:28.026,"- No, I was not."
01:22:28.026,01:22:29.069,"- Quiet, please."
01:22:29.069,01:22:30.696,Silence in court.
01:22:30.696,01:22:34.784,- Did you intend on starting a fire?
01:22:34.784,01:22:37.703,- Not really.
01:22:37.703,01:22:40.497,Does the defendant mean yes or no?
01:22:40.497,01:22:41.624,- Harriet?
01:22:41.624,01:22:43.250,- It means no.
01:22:43.250,01:22:45.043,I had no intention of actually doing it.
01:22:45.043,01:22:46.921,- Was anyone else with you?
01:22:46.921,01:22:48.839,- Not as far as I know.
01:22:48.839,01:22:50.340,- I was.
01:22:51.467,01:22:53.510,- I was.
01:22:53.510,01:22:54.845,- I was.
01:22:54.845,01:22:55.846,- I was.
01:22:55.846,01:22:57.848,- I was.
01:22:57.848,01:22:58.974,- I was.
01:22:58.974,01:22:59.975,- I was.
01:22:59.975,01:23:01.017,- I was.
01:23:01.017,01:23:02.645,- I was.
01:23:02.645,01:23:03.896,I was.
01:23:03.896,01:23:05.731,- Objection!
01:23:05.731,01:23:06.816,Order!
01:23:06.816,01:23:08.024,- I was.
01:23:08.024,01:23:09.192,- Stop it!
01:23:09.192,01:23:10.402,- I was.
01:23:11.821,01:23:13.155,- This is ridiculous!
01:23:13.155,01:23:15.240,What are you all doing?
01:23:15.240,01:23:16.617,You're lying.
01:23:16.617,01:23:18.201,"They're lying, Mrs. Kingsley."
01:23:18.201,01:23:20.746,"- Harriet, you're going down, biatch."
01:23:20.746,01:23:22.581,- This is a conspiracy.
01:23:22.581,01:23:26.836,"You can't expel the whole year, and they know that."
01:23:26.836,01:23:28.170,"- Be quiet, Harriet!"
01:23:28.170,01:23:30.213,"Sit down, everyone."
01:23:30.213,01:23:33.676,- It's a black-and-white case.
01:23:33.676,01:23:35.135,She has to be expelled.
01:23:35.135,01:23:40.516,"The girl set fire to the school, endangering all our precious lives."
01:23:40.516,01:23:45.646,"She walked in there, lighter at the ready, and tried to burn the place down."
01:23:45.646,01:23:46.856,- Lighter?
01:23:46.856,01:23:48.148,"- Not now, Jane."
01:23:48.148,01:23:49.900,Have respect for court protocol.
01:23:49.900,01:23:51.986,"- What lighter, Harriet?"
01:23:51.986,01:23:55.197,"- Jesus, Charlotte, how daft can you possibly be?"
01:23:55.197,01:23:58.033,That ridiculous I heart L.A.
01:23:58.033,01:24:01.036,"She left it behind, for God's sakes."
01:24:01.036,01:24:04.498,"- Except how do you know that, Harriet?"
01:24:04.498,01:24:07.626,No one's mentioned a lighter before.
01:24:07.626,01:24:08.919,- What?
01:24:08.919,01:24:11.505,"Yes, they have."
01:24:11.505,01:24:13.757,Objection.
01:24:13.757,01:24:16.886,"Actually, Harriet, they haven't."
01:24:16.886,01:24:20.055,"- I have to second Jane's question, Harriet."
01:24:20.055,01:24:23.099,How did you know about that lighter?
01:24:23.099,01:24:28.397,"- Well, I-I had-- - Freddie found the lighter before anyone saw it."
01:24:28.397,01:24:33.861,How could you possibly know unless-- unless you were there.
01:24:35.863,01:24:37.573,"- Well, this is absurd."
01:24:37.573,01:24:41.035,I refuse to sit here and listen to these wild-- - I had put it out.
01:24:41.035,01:24:42.118,And I heard footsteps.
01:24:42.118,01:24:43.913,It must've been you.
01:24:43.913,01:24:48.124,"Oh, my God, you restarted the fire, didn't you?"
01:24:48.124,01:24:49.626,"- Harriet, is this true?"
01:24:49.626,01:24:51.127,- Of course not.
01:24:51.127,01:24:54.297,"- It all makes sense now, I knew it."
01:24:54.297,01:24:56.050,I think I'm innocent.
01:24:56.050,01:24:57.885,"- We think so, too."
01:24:57.885,01:24:59.803,"- You're not, you awful bitch!"
01:24:59.803,01:25:01.764,You've turned this school upside down.
01:25:01.764,01:25:03.682,You've ruined everything!
01:25:03.682,01:25:05.059,You started it.
01:25:05.059,01:25:06.936,I only finished what you started!
01:25:06.936,01:25:08.979,- Harriet?
01:25:08.979,01:25:11.941,"My office, now."
01:25:11.941,01:25:13.442,- Uh...
01:25:32.502,01:25:34.254,"- Okay, suckers, show time."
01:25:34.254,01:25:35.881,Let's open a can of whoop-ass.
01:25:37.340,01:25:38.508,"- Come on, Abbey Mount."
01:25:43.013,01:25:44.765,Let's go Abbey Mount!
01:25:47.643,01:25:49.019,"- Come on, girls."
01:25:51.063,01:25:52.648,- Take it!
01:25:58.988,01:26:00.030,"- Come on, guys, we can bring it back."
01:26:00.030,01:26:01.197,Let's go.
01:26:08.538,01:26:09.748,- You got it!
01:26:09.748,01:26:11.416,- Mrs. Kingsley?
01:26:11.416,01:26:13.919,"- Oh, Mr. Moore, you made it."
01:26:13.919,01:26:15.921,"- Please, please, come and take a seat."
01:26:15.921,01:26:18.214,- Did I miss much?
01:26:19.716,01:26:22.011,- Where's Poppy?
01:26:22.011,01:26:24.179,- She's right there.
01:26:47.243,01:26:49.872,"She's the spitting image of her mother, isn't she?"
01:26:52.916,01:26:55.919,- She most certainly is.
01:26:58.463,01:27:00.049,"- Come on, Abbey Mount!"
01:27:00.049,01:27:01.675,Take it out there!
01:27:02.926,01:27:05.888,- Come on!
01:27:05.888,01:27:07.305,Come on!
01:27:16.190,01:27:18.108,"- Come on, Abbey Mount!"
01:27:27.743,01:27:30.079,- You're trying really hard.
01:27:30.079,01:27:31.663,"I know, and..."
01:27:31.663,01:27:33.165,- They've got no possession whatsoever.
01:27:36.919,01:27:38.212,"- All right, ladies."
01:27:38.212,01:27:39.546,There's only one thing for it.
01:27:39.546,01:27:40.797,Let's go.

01:27:53.936,01:27:57.064,- Wrong!
01:28:30.139,01:28:31.932,"- Pass it, Poppy!"
01:28:40.274,01:28:41.399,"- Well done, well done."
01:29:01.878,01:29:03.546,"- Come on, Poppy!"
01:29:04.506,01:29:05.841,- Ha!

01:29:34.703,01:29:36.246,- Drippy!
01:29:36.246,01:29:38.290,- Why would you pass it to me?
01:29:38.290,01:29:40.167,"Oh, my God!"
01:29:40.167,01:29:42.169,Where is everyone?
01:29:42.169,01:29:43.837,"Jane, Jane!"
01:29:43.837,01:29:45.130,Where are you?
01:29:45.130,01:29:46.256,Oops!
01:30:03.315,01:30:04.398,- They did it!
01:30:04.398,01:30:05.734,- Yes!
01:30:05.734,01:30:07.236,- I told you you could do it!

01:30:27.463,01:30:29.174,- Mrs. Kingsley called.
01:30:29.174,01:30:31.134,She told me you found out about Mom.
01:30:31.134,01:30:33.345,"- Why didn't you just tell me, Dad?"
01:30:33.345,01:30:34.930,"- I'm sorry, Poppy."
01:30:34.930,01:30:36.681,I thought it might make you too sad.
01:30:36.681,01:30:41.519,"I did know that you needed to breathe a different kind of air, though."
01:30:41.519,01:30:44.273,Did I do the right thing?
01:30:44.273,01:30:46.108,- You did.
01:30:46.108,01:30:48.277,Did you know Mom was captain of the Lacrosse team?
01:30:48.277,01:30:50.279,- Yes.
01:30:50.279,01:30:57.035,And I also know that she is incredibly proud of you right now.

01:31:06.295,01:31:08.713,"- Daddy, put your back into it!"
01:31:08.713,01:31:13.343,"Harriet, we think you forgot this."
