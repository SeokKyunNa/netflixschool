00:30:50.390,00:30:52.267,Ok...
00:30:55.645,00:30:58.023,I did something really bad.
00:31:00.359,00:31:03.945,About four years ago...
00:31:03.987,00:31:07.407,...the internet started to slow down at our house.
00:31:09.034,00:31:12.996,Spoke to a guy I knew at work who said...
00:31:13.038,00:31:14.289,...maybe...
00:31:14.331,00:31:17.334,...my browser's history was full.
00:31:18.543,00:31:19.753,I went home...
00:31:19.795,00:31:21.129,...I...
00:31:21.171,00:31:24.174,...opened up the internet...
00:31:26.510,00:31:29.012,"...Aaron, such unspeakable things..."
00:31:29.054,00:31:30.722,...I saw.
00:31:35.352,00:31:37.396,Pornography...
00:31:37.437,00:31:39.689,...mostly animal...pornography.
00:31:42.526,00:31:44.403,There's only two people...
00:31:44.444,00:31:46.363,...who use that internet.
00:31:46.405,00:31:47.531,Me...
00:31:47.572,00:31:50.742,"...and my wife, Angela."
00:31:50.784,00:31:53.578,"And I was not looking at animal pornography, Aaron."
00:31:56.790,00:31:59.584,I confronted Angela...
00:31:59.626,00:32:02.212,...she flat-out denied it...
00:32:02.254,00:32:04.297,What could I say?
00:32:05.924,00:32:08.635,I knew it was her.
00:32:08.677,00:32:12.931,"This lie drove a wedge between us, and we..."
00:32:12.973,00:32:15.225,...began to drift apart.
00:32:17.561,00:32:20.063,One weekend...
00:32:20.105,00:32:21.440,...I said we should...
00:32:21.481,00:32:23.150,...come up to the cabin.
00:32:23.191,00:32:25.569,Right here.
00:32:25.610,00:32:28.113,"But on Saturday, I was called back to work..."
00:32:28.155,00:32:30.824,...so I left Angela here by herself.
00:32:33.243,00:32:37.622,"The thing is, I wasn't really called back to work..."
00:32:37.664,00:32:40.625,I went down the street...
00:32:40.667,00:32:44.254,...to the 99 cent store.
00:32:44.296,00:32:46.006,There I found...
00:32:46.047,00:32:48.133,...a mask.
00:32:49.384,00:32:51.052,It was a wolf.
00:32:52.804,00:32:57.100,"Three hours later, I came back to the house..."
00:32:57.142,00:33:00.437,...I put the mask on...
00:33:00.479,00:33:02.856,...I broke in through the back window...
00:33:04.274,00:33:07.944,...Angela was asleep...
00:33:07.986,00:33:09.779,...I tied her up...
00:33:09.821,00:33:12.365,...at which point she awoke...
00:33:12.407,00:33:14.117,...at which point...
00:33:14.159,00:33:16.620,...we proceeded to have...
00:33:16.661,00:33:18.205,...ravenous...
00:33:18.246,00:33:20.290,...animalistic...
00:33:20.332,00:33:22.834,...sexual intercourse.
00:33:25.295,00:33:27.339,I'd never seen her so happy.
00:33:29.925,00:33:32.427,"I have to admit, it didn't feel terrible on my end."
00:33:35.639,00:33:41.353,"I escaped through the window and left her there, tied up."
00:33:41.394,00:33:43.855,When I came back the next morning...
00:33:43.897,00:33:46.608,"...as myself, I asked her how her night was."
00:33:49.402,00:33:51.738,She...
00:33:51.780,00:33:54.115,...said it was fine...
00:33:54.157,00:33:56.868,...with a casual smile.
00:34:00.163,00:34:01.706,We never spoke of it.
00:34:04.167,00:34:06.878,We went home....
00:34:06.920,00:34:11.383,...and in the weeks that followed...
00:34:11.424,00:34:13.343,...the internet...
00:34:13.385,00:34:15.845,...got back up to speed.
00:34:20.559,00:34:23.562,"Aaron, I raped my own wife."
00:00:32.073,00:00:40.582,"- All right, We are leaving the flatlands and we are heading up towards the mountain top, which I'll show you right here."
00:00:43.334,00:00:45.795,Way up there.
00:00:45.879,00:00:48.590,I'm not sure who I'm meeting.
00:00:48.673,00:00:50.425,"The ad said $1,000 for the day."
00:00:50.508,00:00:52.844,Filming services.
00:00:52.927,00:00:57.307,"Discretion is appreciated, whatever that means."
00:01:02.353,00:01:25.877,"So, here's a thought: What if this is just some 40-something who's sitting alone in her apartment waiting for some young handsome boy to come up the hill and give rubdowns, money, and whisper sweet nothings?"
00:01:25.960,00:01:27.253,It's just a thought.
00:01:33.134,00:01:34.385,Cute little lake.
00:01:37.388,00:01:39.015,Cute little town.
00:01:54.405,00:02:01.454,This is promising.
00:02:01.538,00:02:03.498,This is it.
00:02:03.581,00:02:04.999,A yellow door.
00:02:36.698,00:02:37.782,Okay.
00:02:44.289,00:02:45.206,Okay.
00:02:45.290,00:02:49.627,"No answer and no voicemail, so that's good."
00:03:05.935,00:03:07.437,Hmm.
00:03:08.855,00:03:11.482,"Okay, so..."
00:03:11.566,00:03:14.694,I think it's smarter if I wait in the car.
00:03:19.407,00:03:29.000,"You know, just-- I don't think this guy's showing up."
00:03:29.083,00:03:31.628,Which is too-- - Hi!
00:03:31.711,00:03:33.254,"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."
00:03:33.338,00:03:34.505,"- Oh, it's okay."
00:03:34.589,00:03:36.007,- I'm assuming you're Aaron?
00:03:36.090,00:03:37.050,- Yeah.
00:03:37.133,00:03:38.843,Nice to meet you.
00:03:38.927,00:03:40.011,"Oh, my God."
00:03:41.638,00:03:43.514,"Oh, my God."
00:03:43.598,00:03:46.809,This is gonna be a good day.
00:03:46.893,00:03:52.065,"- You have a really nice, kind face."
00:03:52.148,00:03:53.775,- Thank you.
00:03:53.858,00:03:58.905,Come on.
00:03:58.988,00:04:04.369,"- I feel like we should just do this right now because at the end of the day it's gonna be normal, so let me just."
00:04:04.452,00:04:06.454,- Oh. Okay.
00:04:06.537,00:04:10.124,"- Trust me, that's not gonna be anything weird at all."
00:04:15.797,00:04:17.966,Never get used to those stairs.
00:04:20.009,00:04:22.303,All right.
00:04:22.387,00:04:24.097,"So, welcome."
00:04:24.180,00:04:28.142,This is our family vacation home.
00:04:28.226,00:04:30.061,A lot of special memories.
00:04:30.144,00:04:35.984,"Can see, if you check out these paintings, I made these with my dad when I was younger."
00:04:36.067,00:04:39.570,"So, I'm sure you're anxious to get started..."
00:04:39.654,00:04:40.780,- Yeah.
00:04:40.863,00:04:42.115,- Okay.
00:04:42.198,00:04:43.825,- Let's get you over here.
00:04:43.908,00:04:45.743,I am a cancer survivor.
00:04:45.827,00:04:48.913,"I had cancer in the liver, spread to the lungs."
00:04:48.997,00:04:50.164,"So, pretty bad."
00:04:50.248,00:04:51.582,They gave me the chemo.
00:04:51.666,00:04:53.001,I knocked it out.
00:04:53.084,00:04:54.752,"Really, it was-- went into remission immediately."
00:04:54.836,00:04:56.754,It was-- it was pretty incredible.
00:04:56.838,00:05:07.390,"Unfortunately, two months ago, I started getting these dizzy spells and some--some sort of weird cognitive misfirings."
00:05:07.473,00:05:09.767,I went back in to see the doctor.
00:05:09.851,00:05:11.728,Brain tumor size of a baseball here.
00:05:11.811,00:05:13.730,"- Oh, no."
00:05:13.813,00:05:16.983,"Um, so they gave me about two to three months to live."
00:05:17.066,00:05:18.401,"I'm hoping I beat it, you know?"
00:05:18.484,00:05:21.863,And the power of positive thinking.
00:05:21.946,00:05:24.782,Maybe?
00:05:24.866,00:05:29.245,"But in case I don't, I'm married."
00:05:29.329,00:05:32.999,"My beautiful wife, Angela, of six years, is pregnant with our first child."
00:05:33.082,00:05:34.167,"Hi, Buddy."
00:05:34.250,00:05:35.752,We're calling it Buddy.
00:05:35.835,00:05:39.714,"Um, and have you ever seen the film My Life?"
00:05:39.797,00:05:41.049,- No.
00:05:41.132,00:05:42.925,"- It's a beautiful, beautiful film."
00:05:43.009,00:05:50.391,"Michael Keaton gets cancer in the film, and he makes a video diary of himself for his unborn son."
00:05:50.475,00:05:52.351,"- Oh, okay."
00:05:52.435,00:05:53.895,"- Yeah, you can see."
00:05:53.978,00:06:04.447,"So, our job today is to keep that camera rolling, as we discussed, and I just want you to walk with me."
00:06:04.530,00:06:06.032,I don't know exactly what I'm gonna do.
00:06:06.115,00:06:08.159,"I want you to document me, how I am."
00:06:08.242,00:06:18.002,"I don't need to glorify me or make me seem cool or anything other than what I am, so, Buddy, you can see me for the man I was."
00:06:18.086,00:06:20.296,"And, um..."
00:06:20.379,00:06:22.048,I hope you're up for it.
00:06:24.592,00:06:27.553,- Okay.
00:06:27.637,00:06:29.138,- Yeah. Yeah.
00:06:29.222,00:06:31.224,Let's do it.
00:06:31.307,00:06:32.600,- I thought you were gonna run away.
00:06:32.683,00:06:33.768,- No.
00:06:33.851,00:06:35.103,Okay.
00:06:39.273,00:06:40.858,- This is for you.
00:06:40.942,00:06:42.401,"- Oh, that's all right."
00:06:42.485,00:06:44.403,Take the whole thing.
00:06:44.487,00:06:45.988,"This is, uh..."
00:06:46.072,00:06:48.825,"this is no longer a business transaction, okay?"
00:06:48.908,00:06:49.826,- Okay.
00:06:49.909,00:07:00.795,"- This is a partnership, and this is a journey into the heart, and I'm real glad it's you coming with me."
00:07:00.878,00:07:03.297,I think we're gonna do great.
00:07:03.381,00:07:06.425,You ready for this?
00:07:06.509,00:07:07.677,"- Okay, let's do it."
00:07:07.760,00:07:09.679,I'm gonna go get in the tub.
00:07:14.267,00:07:16.227,- In the tub?
00:07:16.310,00:07:18.604,"- Yeah, come on up."
00:07:18.688,00:07:21.607,It's okay.
00:07:36.789,00:07:37.748,"- Oh, sorry."
00:07:37.832,00:07:38.958,- It's okay.
00:07:39.041,00:07:40.042,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:07:40.126,00:07:44.297,We're--we're gonna go a lot deeper places than this.
00:07:45.965,00:07:47.800,Okay? You all right?
00:07:47.884,00:07:49.135,- You sure?
00:07:49.218,00:07:51.012,- Okay.
00:07:51.095,00:07:53.931,You want a sandwich or anything?
00:07:54.015,00:07:56.058,"- All right, maybe when we get out of the tub."
00:07:56.142,00:07:58.144,I'm getting in the tub.
00:07:58.227,00:07:59.437,- Okay.
00:07:59.520,00:08:00.980,- Okay.
00:08:03.065,00:08:06.444,- Okay.
00:08:06.527,00:08:08.112,"- Okay, you rolling?"
00:08:08.196,00:08:10.781,- Just checking.
00:08:10.865,00:08:12.658,"All right, Buddy."
00:08:12.742,00:08:16.579,Welcome to your first tubby.
00:08:16.662,00:08:19.207,"When I was your age, I used to take tubbies with my dad."
00:08:19.290,00:08:23.878,"We'd call 'em tubby time, and it was pretty much the greatest time of the day."
00:08:23.961,00:08:32.803,"So since you and I might not get to do a tubby together, I thought we would have our first tubby right here."
00:08:32.887,00:08:34.597,You ready?
00:08:34.680,00:08:35.681,Okay.
00:08:35.765,00:08:37.225,All right.
00:08:37.308,00:08:39.477,"Now, let's get those tootsies wet."
00:08:39.560,00:08:41.187,You ready?
00:08:41.270,00:08:42.313,Boo.
00:08:42.396,00:08:44.774,"Oh, ooh, it tickles, doesn't it?"
00:08:44.857,00:08:46.776,"Oh, stinker."
00:08:46.859,00:08:48.945,Stinker-roo.
00:08:49.028,00:08:52.198,Oh.
00:08:52.281,00:08:53.908,"Ooh, this one actually smells pretty good."
00:08:56.661,00:08:58.204,"I know, it's fun, isn't it?"
00:08:58.287,00:09:01.374,I know.
00:09:01.457,00:09:04.001,Ooh.
00:09:05.670,00:09:07.922,Just lean back and close your eyes.
00:09:08.005,00:09:10.424,A little shampoo.
00:09:10.508,00:09:13.344,A massage rub.
00:09:13.427,00:09:14.804,Mmm.
00:09:14.887,00:09:17.306,Yeah.
00:09:17.390,00:09:18.516,Mmm.
00:09:18.599,00:09:20.768,Now is my favorite part.
00:09:20.851,00:09:24.689,We're just gonna lay back.
00:09:24.772,00:09:26.232,"Oh, Buddy."
00:09:26.315,00:09:28.442,"Oh, yeah."
00:09:30.027,00:09:31.696,"Ooh, ooh."
00:09:33.030,00:09:35.408,"Ooh, you like the fire?"
00:09:36.492,00:09:40.121,Mm.
00:09:40.204,00:09:42.123,We'll watch the fire.
00:09:44.667,00:09:50.590,You and me.
00:09:50.673,00:09:53.509,Mmm.
00:09:53.593,00:09:55.761,I love you so much.
00:10:07.356,00:10:09.859,"Can't stop thinking about it, Aaron."
00:10:13.904,00:10:16.449,- What?
00:10:16.532,00:10:21.245,- Two to three months.
00:10:21.329,00:10:28.127,"Most of which I will either be in pain, or at the very least sad."
00:10:28.210,00:10:30.963,"I mean, look at this scene."
00:10:31.047,00:10:32.632,It's a tubby scene.
00:10:32.715,00:10:34.133,It's supposed to be fun.
00:10:34.216,00:10:36.093,"It's not supposed to be sad, you know?"
00:10:39.847,00:10:46.520,"I just can't help thinking, Why wait?"
00:10:49.815,00:10:51.192,You know?
00:10:51.275,00:10:56.238,'Cause I could just end it right now.
00:10:59.408,00:11:01.160,"I could, you know."
00:11:12.546,00:11:16.092,- Josef?
00:11:16.175,00:11:18.803,Hey.
00:11:18.886,00:11:24.892,Josef?
00:11:24.975,00:11:27.353,Hey.
00:11:27.436,00:11:28.354,Josef.
00:11:33.067,00:11:35.194,"Oh, man, I'm sorry."
00:11:35.277,00:11:37.029,"Oh, man, that was--that was a joke."
00:11:37.113,00:11:38.739,It was supposed to be a joke.
00:11:38.823,00:11:40.241,I'm so sorry.
00:11:40.324,00:11:41.784,Okay.
00:11:41.867,00:11:43.369,"I've got a weird sense of humor, man."
00:11:43.452,00:11:45.663,I'm-- I'm really sorry about that.
00:11:45.746,00:11:47.415,- It's okay.
00:11:47.498,00:11:54.380,"- Um, it was just getting, like, really serious in here, and I was just, like, you know, trying to lighten the mood."
00:11:55.840,00:11:57.341,Do you want to go outside or something?
00:11:57.425,00:11:59.552,You want to get some fresh air?
00:11:59.635,00:12:01.345,- Yeah.
00:12:01.429,00:12:03.264,"- Oh, Aaron. You might want a heavier jacket."
00:12:03.347,00:12:05.057,It's a little chilly out there.
00:12:05.141,00:12:08.853,- There's-- there should be something in the guest bedroom closet if you want to snag one.
00:12:08.936,00:12:10.479,- Okay.
00:12:10.563,00:12:14.150,Cool.
00:12:15.484,00:12:16.861,- What? What?
00:12:16.944,00:12:20.030,What happened?
00:12:20.114,00:12:21.031,Oh.
00:12:21.115,00:12:22.283,That's Peachfuzz.
00:12:22.366,00:12:24.535,That's--that's just Peachfuzz.
00:12:24.618,00:12:26.036,Say hello.
00:12:26.120,00:12:28.247,Um...
00:12:28.330,00:12:30.416,"Actually, you know, I'm glad this happened."
00:12:30.499,00:12:32.042,"Buddy, you're gonna love this."
00:12:32.126,00:12:44.472,"So, Peachfuzz is a friendly wolf, and my dad created him and he actually used to have this great kind of song that Peachfuzz sings for little kids."
00:13:17.671,00:13:19.673,"What do you think, Buddy?"
00:13:19.757,00:13:21.091,That's Peachfuzz.
00:13:21.175,00:13:22.635,Say hi.
00:13:24.929,00:13:26.305,All right.
00:13:26.388,00:13:27.473,"Oh, nice."
00:13:27.556,00:13:28.641,Look.
00:13:28.724,00:13:31.393,Got some hats.
00:13:31.477,00:13:33.437,"Huh, twinsies."
00:13:33.521,00:13:36.190,"I'm over here, Buddy."
00:13:36.273,00:13:38.108,Right here.
00:13:38.192,00:13:40.611,"So, look, there's a legend about this trail that we're going to."
00:13:40.694,00:13:46.575,"It's called Las Aguas Milagros de Corazon, which means, The miracle waters of the heart."
00:13:46.659,00:13:51.914,Your mom and I heard about it from this really cool Hispanic lady who runs this taco truck down by the lake.
00:13:51.997,00:14:02.299,"Anyway, the lore has it that there's, like, a healing body of water out here that has something to do with a heart, but apparently only those who are pure of heart can partake of it."
00:14:02.383,00:14:05.844,"So, anyhow, that is what we're going to find today."
00:14:05.928,00:14:09.807,"How's your heart, Aaron?"
00:14:09.890,00:14:11.976,- It better be.
00:14:12.059,00:14:13.018,Whoo-hoo!
00:14:13.102,00:14:14.061,"All right, Buddy."
00:14:14.144,00:14:15.145,Let's go cure some cancer.
00:14:26.323,00:14:28.284,"Shh, shh, shh, shh."
00:14:28.367,00:14:29.827,Did you see that?
00:14:29.910,00:14:32.830,- Did you see anything up there?
00:14:32.913,00:14:34.373,What was it?
00:14:39.712,00:14:41.255,- I thought I heard something.
00:14:49.597,00:14:51.181,- Josef?
00:15:02.526,00:15:04.153,Josef?
00:15:12.661,00:15:14.204,"Hey, man."
00:15:18.000,00:15:19.627,Is everything okay?
00:15:40.147,00:15:41.482,"Oh, my God."
00:15:41.565,00:15:43.400,Aaron.
00:15:43.484,00:15:44.818,Obviously you didn't see your face.
00:15:44.902,00:15:46.320,Holy cow.
00:15:46.403,00:15:47.613,You--here.
00:15:47.696,00:15:48.948,I just need to show you something.
00:15:49.031,00:15:51.742,You need to see your face.
00:15:51.825,00:15:52.993,"All right, you're a little mad."
00:15:53.077,00:15:54.370,I'm sorry.
00:15:54.453,00:15:57.456,"- But oh, my God, that was incredible."
00:15:57.539,00:16:01.210,That was--you just had a near-death experience.
00:16:01.293,00:16:02.336,- Yeah.
00:16:02.419,00:16:05.506,- That's what it feels like when you feel like you're gonna die.
00:16:05.589,00:16:08.384,"It's incredible, isn't it?"
00:16:08.467,00:16:10.344,- Yeah.
00:16:10.427,00:16:11.595,- You all right?
00:16:11.679,00:16:12.888,I'm fine. Thanks.
00:16:12.972,00:16:14.765,- All right.
00:16:14.848,00:16:17.518,"It's powerful, isn't it?"
00:16:17.601,00:16:27.611,"- You know, what's really amazing is, there was about two seconds there after you were done being scared where it looked like you wanted to kill me."
00:16:29.154,00:16:33.117,"- No, I-I-I was-- it was just the-- - I don't take it personally."
00:16:33.200,00:16:34.952,"I think it was a visceral reaction, you know?"
00:16:35.035,00:16:40.833,"It's a defense thing, but-- but there's an animal in you."
00:16:40.916,00:16:44.712,There's a little Peachfuzz inside you yet.
00:16:48.507,00:16:52.386,Anybody you need to make peace with in this world?
00:16:52.469,00:16:54.013,Before you go?
00:16:56.807,00:16:58.559,- I have an ex.
00:16:58.642,00:17:00.394,- You have an axe?
00:17:00.477,00:17:02.855,"- Oh, I thought you were gonna tell me you had, like, an axe to grind."
00:17:02.938,00:17:05.190,I have an axe back at the house.
00:17:05.274,00:17:06.859,- Yeah.
00:17:06.942,00:17:08.902,"No, I saw it."
00:17:08.986,00:17:11.447,- Can I ask you a question and you'll answer me honestly?
00:17:11.530,00:17:13.407,- Okay.
00:17:13.490,00:17:20.164,"- When you saw that axe out in front of the house, was there a small part of you that thought I might kill you with it?"
00:17:22.041,00:17:23.876,"- Yeah, but I didn't know you."
00:17:23.959,00:17:26.378,- You did?
00:17:26.462,00:17:29.381,That's great.
00:17:29.465,00:17:33.886,"- Josef, I don't remember how long we've been walking for."
00:17:33.969,00:17:35.846,Are you getting hungry?
00:17:35.929,00:17:38.640,But you're doing great and just-- we got to keep in motion.
00:17:38.724,00:17:40.017,- Okay.
00:17:40.100,00:17:41.060,Look.
00:17:41.143,00:17:42.895,Hey.
00:17:44.354,00:17:46.857,- All right.
00:17:50.986,00:17:53.322,- Sewer pipeline.
00:17:53.405,00:17:54.448,It's shit water.
00:17:54.531,00:17:56.784,- It's something.
00:17:56.867,00:17:57.785,Better than nothing.
00:17:57.868,00:17:59.953,Come on.
00:18:00.037,00:18:01.163,- Josef.
00:18:01.246,00:18:02.331,- What's up?
00:18:02.414,00:18:05.417,- Are you-- you remember how to get back?
00:18:05.501,00:18:08.962,- No. I don't.
00:18:09.046,00:18:10.172,- Okay.
00:18:10.255,00:18:16.720,"It's just we've taken a lot of-- a lot of forks in the road, switchbacks that-- I just--I haven't been keeping track, so..."
00:18:16.804,00:18:18.305,- I haven't either.
00:18:18.388,00:18:19.765,"But that's--I mean, that's back there, man."
00:18:19.848,00:18:23.060,We got to-- We got to go forward.
00:18:23.143,00:18:27.648,"- You know, we can't find the miracle if we got a rope attached to us, you know what I'm saying?"
00:18:27.731,00:18:28.857,- Right.
00:18:32.111,00:18:33.612,- Holy shit.
00:18:33.695,00:18:36.323,Holy shit.
00:18:36.406,00:18:39.576,- Josef.
00:18:39.660,00:18:43.622,- Come see!
00:18:43.705,00:18:45.249,See?
00:18:54.842,00:18:57.177,Aaron.
00:18:57.261,00:18:58.554,- Yeah?
00:18:58.637,00:19:01.098,- You are not gonna ever believe this.
00:19:09.523,00:19:15.320,"Aaron, I want you to point your camera down there and tell me what you see."
00:19:23.579,00:19:27.374,"- Oh, my God."
00:19:27.457,00:19:32.045,"It's a heart, man."
00:19:32.129,00:19:33.672,That's a heart down there.
00:19:37.634,00:19:39.219,You were right.
00:19:39.303,00:19:41.638,- It's a heart.
00:19:41.722,00:19:43.599,But it's also a miracle.
00:19:46.977,00:19:50.355,Only the pure of heart can be healed.
00:19:50.439,00:19:52.191,Yes.
00:19:52.274,00:19:53.942,Heal those big ol' tootsies.
00:19:55.652,00:19:57.237,Amazing.
00:19:57.321,00:19:58.614,Whoo-hoo!
00:20:00.699,00:20:01.700,- Whoo-hoo!
00:20:01.783,00:20:03.410,"- It's chilly, huh?"
00:20:03.493,00:20:04.494,All right.
00:20:04.578,00:20:06.121,Whoo!
00:20:06.205,00:20:08.081,- Whoo!
00:20:08.165,00:20:11.460,- Yeah!
00:20:11.543,00:20:13.212,"Okay, you do me."
00:20:35.150,00:20:36.860,Tell you what.
00:20:36.944,00:20:39.446,I know a little place called Billy Bear's.
00:20:39.529,00:20:41.240,It has the best god damn pancakes in the world.
00:20:41.323,00:20:43.450,You still hungry?
00:20:43.533,00:20:45.160,- All right.
00:20:45.244,00:20:46.995,"- All right, let's do it."
00:20:47.079,00:20:48.205,- Okay.
00:20:48.288,00:20:49.831,- Let's see what's good here.
00:20:49.915,00:20:51.750,"- It's the pancakes, right?"
00:20:53.585,00:20:55.379,Didn't you say you used to come here with your family?
00:20:55.462,00:20:56.922,- What's that?
00:20:57.005,00:20:59.508,- Didn't you used to come here for years?
00:20:59.591,00:21:00.926,"- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:21:01.009,00:21:10.686,"No, it's just they changed the menu, so I was just curious if there was anything else, but yeah, I mean, obviously the pancakes are the thing."
00:21:10.769,00:21:12.938,"Hey, Aaron."
00:21:13.021,00:21:14.648,- Yeah?
00:21:18.402,00:21:20.654,- Have you ever done anything you're really ashamed of?
00:21:22.656,00:21:23.824,- Yeah.
00:21:23.907,00:21:26.952,- Would you mind telling me about it?
00:21:27.035,00:21:29.830,"- Uh, yeah, okay."
00:21:29.913,00:21:30.831,- Really?
00:21:30.914,00:21:32.124,"Here, give me the camera."
00:21:32.207,00:21:33.292,"Come on, I'll-- it'll be fun."
00:21:33.375,00:21:34.293,I'll...
00:21:34.376,00:21:35.544,- Okay.
00:21:35.627,00:21:37.087,- Take the focus off of me for a second.
00:21:37.170,00:21:38.880,There we go.
00:21:40.757,00:21:42.259,Handsome devil.
00:21:42.342,00:21:44.344,"- Um, okay."
00:21:44.428,00:21:48.098,"Um, I guess-- let me think."
00:21:48.181,00:21:51.768,"I was, um..."
00:21:51.852,00:21:57.441,"I used to-- I used to just pee my pants a lot, um, when I was a little kid."
00:21:57.524,00:21:58.442,- Ooh.
00:21:58.525,00:22:00.527,"- And, um..."
00:22:00.610,00:22:04.698,"it got to the point where my mom got this, uh..."
00:22:04.781,00:22:09.703,"device from a mail-order catalogue that was, um..."
00:22:09.786,00:22:20.339,it was like a--like a thing attached to my wrist with a wire that went up my arm and down my shirt into my pants.
00:22:20.422,00:22:29.097,- And with a little sensor on it that would-- that would beep at the sound of--or at the-- it would-- when it felt wetness.
00:22:29.181,00:22:45.822,"And, uh, I remember one time when I was just out on the monkey bars with my friends, I had to go really bad, and I didn't want to, and I just--I just started just pissing my pants."
00:22:45.906,00:23:00.045,"And then--and then the monitor starting going off, and so there I was, you know, laying in the sand just with piss all over myself and this loud alarm going off."
00:23:00.128,00:23:06.676,"And that was probably the first time, or at least the first time I remember, feeling-- feeling shame."
00:23:06.760,00:23:09.012,"- Thanks for sharing that with me, man."
00:23:09.096,00:23:10.472,- Yeah.
00:23:10.555,00:23:12.057,- It's not easy to talk about that stuff.
00:23:12.140,00:23:14.893,I appreciate it.
00:23:14.976,00:23:17.354,Okay.
00:23:17.437,00:23:20.190,- Can I have a turn?
00:23:20.273,00:23:21.608,"- Uh, yeah."
00:23:21.691,00:23:23.527,Okay.
00:23:46.967,00:23:48.510,What?
00:23:48.593,00:23:53.181,What is that?
00:23:53.265,00:23:59.688,Is that-- That's me.
00:23:59.771,00:24:03.483,- Yeah.
00:24:03.567,00:24:05.152,I took pictures of you.
00:24:11.783,00:24:13.243,- Okay.
00:24:16.913,00:24:18.498,Why?
00:24:18.582,00:24:19.875,- I don't know.
00:24:25.755,00:24:41.354,"I suppose I was nervous before you came up, and I felt that if I got to know you before you got to know me, then I would be less scared."
00:24:48.195,00:24:51.364,I'm sorry.
00:24:51.448,00:24:57.787,I wouldn't have done it if I knew you then like I know you now.
00:25:00.498,00:25:05.337,"And I'm very ashamed of it, and I hope we can move past it."
00:25:16.681,00:25:18.016,Okay?
00:25:20.310,00:25:21.978,- Okay.
00:25:20.310,00:25:25.440,"No, I'm--it's-- it's a little weird, but I'm--I'm past it."
00:25:25.523,00:25:28.318,- You are?
00:25:28.401,00:25:29.444,- Yeah.
00:25:29.527,00:25:31.321,"Yeah, it's fine."
00:25:36.076,00:25:37.535,- Thank you.
00:25:48.588,00:25:49.589,- Josef.
00:25:49.673,00:25:51.549,- Yeah?
00:25:51.633,00:25:56.054,- I think-- I think I'm gonna head back.
00:25:56.137,00:26:00.642,"Um, I got-- I got all my stuff on me."
00:26:00.725,00:26:05.981,I just think I'll just head back down the hill now.
00:26:06.064,00:26:08.525,- Oh.
00:26:08.608,00:26:10.652,Oh.
00:26:10.735,00:26:14.030,I was going to pour you a whiskey.
00:26:19.995,00:26:21.329,"- Yeah, no."
00:26:21.413,00:26:24.124,"I-I think, uh..."
00:26:24.207,00:26:29.921,"I think it's a long drive, and it's kind of treacherous going down the hill."
00:26:30.005,00:26:34.342,I think I'll just-- - It takes about 20 minutes going down.
00:26:34.426,00:26:42.809,"You can coast the whole way; it's not-- I think we should commemorate our day, Aaron."
00:26:42.892,00:26:50.442,I feel like we should raise our glasses together and celebrate.
00:26:54.237,00:26:56.323,"One drink, okay?"
00:26:56.406,00:26:59.576,"One drink, and I'll send you on your merry way."
00:27:03.079,00:27:04.914,Please?
00:27:04.998,00:27:07.083,- Okay.
00:27:07.167,00:27:08.710,- One drink.
00:27:20.138,00:27:21.514,- Sorry.
00:27:21.598,00:27:22.640,I keep doing that.
00:27:22.724,00:27:23.725,"Come on, let's go."
00:27:26.686,00:27:28.605,"This is great, huh?"
00:27:28.688,00:27:31.483,Two guys having some whiskeys.
00:27:31.566,00:27:32.525,"It's really great, man."
00:27:32.609,00:27:34.778,"What a great day, you know?"
00:27:34.861,00:27:36.237,And I don't take my days lightly.
00:27:36.321,00:27:37.572,"I mean, really."
00:27:37.655,00:27:41.451,"I could've spent it with my family, but I made a new friend."
00:27:41.534,00:27:43.495,Just a great day.
00:27:43.578,00:27:45.288,"- Yeah, it was a good day."
00:27:45.372,00:27:48.500,"What made you decide to come up here and do this with me, anyway?"
00:27:51.127,00:27:52.796,- I guess it was a job.
00:27:52.879,00:27:55.173,"- The money, huh?"
00:27:55.256,00:27:56.466,- Yeah.
00:27:56.549,00:28:00.428,"- You having money problems, Aaron?"
00:28:00.512,00:28:01.971,- No.
00:28:02.055,00:28:03.306,There's nothing to be ashamed of.
00:28:03.390,00:28:05.100,People have money problems.
00:28:07.769,00:28:11.773,"- I mean, it's tough, but, you know-- - Of course it's tough."
00:28:11.856,00:28:15.235,"When I was your age, I didn't have a row to hoe, you know?"
00:28:15.318,00:28:22.575,"It took a while before I accumulated the wealth I have, and I've actually accumulated quite a bit."
00:28:22.659,00:28:25.203,"And, um..."
00:28:25.286,00:28:31.793,"I've been thinking about it today, and I want to give you some money, Aaron."
00:28:31.876,00:28:36.548,"- No, thank-- That's--that's nice of you, but it's okay."
00:28:36.631,00:28:39.259,- Why is everyone so uncomfortable with money?
00:28:39.342,00:28:42.679,"Look, if you had an excess of food, and I was hungry, wouldn't you give it to me?"
00:28:45.056,00:28:47.016,- Yeah.
00:28:47.100,00:28:49.686,"Because you're my friend, and you're kind."
00:28:49.769,00:28:52.689,I have an excess of money.
00:28:52.772,00:28:55.650,You have a need.
00:28:55.734,00:28:56.651,It's simple.
00:28:56.735,00:29:00.989,"- Oh, I-- - There's a check in your boot, Aaron."
00:29:05.702,00:29:06.995,Gotcha.
00:29:07.078,00:29:08.621,All right.
00:29:08.705,00:29:09.998,Sorry.
00:29:10.081,00:29:14.878,"There's not a check in your boot, but you looked, which means you need money."
00:29:14.961,00:29:17.088,Let me help you.
00:29:17.172,00:29:19.174,We don't have to figure it out now.
00:29:19.257,00:29:22.010,Just saying.
00:29:22.093,00:29:23.261,"- Okay, um..."
00:29:23.344,00:29:25.054,- Here.
00:29:25.138,00:29:26.139,"- Okay, cheers."
00:29:30.935,00:29:32.228,All right.
00:29:32.312,00:29:34.355,"Well, I think we're good."
00:29:35.899,00:29:37.025,Um...
00:29:37.108,00:29:39.194,- Where are you-- are you leaving?
00:29:39.277,00:29:41.738,- Here.
00:29:41.821,00:29:44.240,"- I think it's-- yeah, I think, um..."
00:29:44.324,00:29:45.992,- I lied to you.
00:29:54.918,00:29:56.878,- What--what about?
00:30:02.675,00:30:04.469,- Peachfuzz.
00:30:08.348,00:30:14.771,"Aaron, if I tell you something, would you promise me you would never tell another living soul?"
00:30:14.854,00:30:18.608,"I need to get something off of my chest, before..."
00:30:23.238,00:30:25.949,- Okay.
00:30:26.032,00:30:27.033,- But this is only for you.
00:30:27.116,00:30:29.077,"Buddy, I'm sorry."
00:30:29.160,00:30:31.579,This is not for you to hear.
00:30:31.663,00:30:36.292,"Aaron, would you sit down please and turn the camera off?"
00:30:36.376,00:30:37.794,- Um...
00:30:37.877,00:30:39.462,- Okay.
00:30:48.680,00:30:49.973,Okay.
00:30:50.056,00:30:51.099,- It's off?
00:30:51.182,00:30:52.600,- Okay.
00:30:55.645,00:31:00.275,I did something really bad.
00:31:00.358,00:31:04.070,About four years ago...
00:31:04.153,00:31:08.950,the internet started to slow down at our house.
00:31:09.033,00:31:12.829,Spoke to a guy I knew at work who said...
00:31:12.912,00:31:17.667,maybe my browser's history was full.
00:31:18.793,00:31:20.003,I went home.
00:31:20.086,00:31:23.047,I opened up the internet.
00:31:26.968,00:31:30.013,"Aaron, such unspeakable things I saw."
00:31:35.435,00:31:37.353,Pornography.
00:31:42.775,00:31:46.446,There's only two people who use that internet.
00:31:46.529,00:31:50.909,"Me and my wife, Angela."
00:31:57.040,00:31:59.667,I confronted Angela.
00:31:59.751,00:32:02.170,She flat-out denied it.
00:32:02.253,00:32:03.713,What could I say?
00:32:05.924,00:32:08.593,I knew it was her.
00:32:08.676,00:32:14.557,"This lie drove a wedge between us, and we began to drift apart."
00:32:17.769,00:32:23.107,"One weekend, I said we should come up to the cabin."
00:32:23.191,00:32:25.652,Right here.
00:32:25.735,00:32:30.198,"But on Saturday, I was called back to work, so I left Angela here by herself."
00:32:33.409,00:32:37.789,"The thing is, I wasn't really called back to work."
00:32:37.872,00:32:42.335,I went down the street to the 99 cent store.
00:32:44.545,00:32:47.256,There I found a mask.
00:32:49.384,00:32:50.969,It was a wolf.
00:32:53.012,00:32:57.350,"Three hours later, I came back to the house."
00:32:57.433,00:33:00.395,I put the mask on.
00:33:00.478,00:33:02.522,I broke in through the back window.
00:33:08.027,00:33:12.573,"I tied her up, at which point she awoke."
00:33:12.657,00:33:21.833,"At which point, we proceeded to have ravenous, animalistic sexual intercourse."
00:33:25.378,00:33:27.338,I'd never seen her so happy.
00:33:29.924,00:33:32.719,"I have to admit, it didn't feel terrible on my end."
00:33:35.847,00:33:41.310,"I escaped through the window and left her there, tied up."
00:33:41.394,00:33:46.566,"When I came back the next morning, as myself, I asked her how her night was."
00:33:49.402,00:33:55.742,"She said it was fine, with a casual smile."
00:34:06.961,00:34:15.094,"And in the weeks that followed, the internet got back up to speed."
00:34:20.558,00:34:22.643,"Aaron, I raped my own wife."
00:34:27.607,00:34:31.110,"So, in summation, this is me in a nutshell, you know?"
00:34:31.194,00:34:34.489,"This is your dear old dad, warts and all."
00:34:34.572,00:34:36.783,"I want to say that I love you, Buddy."
00:34:36.866,00:34:39.660,"And, um..."
00:34:39.744,00:34:41.037,- Okay.
00:34:41.120,00:34:42.038,- I think that's good.
00:34:42.121,00:34:43.790,- Really?
00:34:43.873,00:34:45.708,I think that was great.
00:34:45.792,00:34:47.335,- That didn't feel great to me.
00:34:47.418,00:34:50.713,"- No, I think-- I think we got it."
00:34:50.797,00:34:54.383,"- I don't know, that wasn't very certain."
00:34:54.467,00:34:56.928,- Have you seen my keys?
00:34:57.011,00:34:58.387,"- They're in your jacket, right?"
00:34:58.471,00:35:02.517,"- Yeah, I thought they were."
00:35:02.600,00:35:06.395,"- Well, maybe they're in your jeans or something?"
00:35:06.479,00:35:07.647,- I don't know.
00:35:07.730,00:35:08.898,- On the table?
00:35:11.067,00:35:13.402,"I feel like if we get one more take, we'll nail this."
00:35:13.486,00:35:15.238,- You know what?
00:35:15.321,00:35:17.865,"I really think that was the one, man."
00:35:20.451,00:35:22.829,"- Is everything okay, Aaron?"
00:35:22.912,00:35:33.881,"- Yeah, just-- Yeah, we're-- - Aaron."
00:35:33.965,00:35:36.259,- Yeah?
00:35:36.342,00:35:38.594,- Did I freak you out with my rape story?
00:35:43.724,00:35:45.518,- No.
00:35:45.601,00:35:49.021,- Why are you in such a hurry?
00:35:49.105,00:35:53.776,"- Just-- - Aaron, come here, look."
00:35:53.860,00:35:55.111,You can stay here.
00:35:55.194,00:35:57.405,I've got plenty of comfortable beds.
00:35:57.488,00:35:59.282,"You know, we got-- there's whiskey here."
00:35:59.365,00:36:02.702,"It's a long drive down to-- - Josef, I need to go home."
00:36:02.785,00:36:04.495,"- I know, Aaron."
00:36:04.579,00:36:05.788,I know you need to go home.
00:36:05.872,00:36:09.417,But what I'm telling you is that we cannot find your keys.
00:36:09.500,00:36:10.960,It's dark in this house.
00:36:11.043,00:36:13.004,"Technically, you are over 0.08."
00:36:13.087,00:36:16.132,"If you get pulled over by the police, you will get a DUI."
00:36:16.215,00:36:18.968,"In the morning, this house'll be flooded with light."
00:36:19.051,00:36:20.344,We'll find your keys.
00:36:20.428,00:36:21.637,You'll be sober.
00:36:21.721,00:36:25.099,And you can drive home then.
00:36:25.183,00:36:26.684,You understand?
00:36:36.319,00:36:38.154,Sorry I raised my voice.
00:36:41.657,00:36:44.118,- Sorry I got a little antsy back there.
00:36:44.202,00:36:47.079,- That's okay.
00:36:47.163,00:36:51.042,"- Yeah, I just-- I think the roads are probably treacherous."
00:36:51.125,00:36:52.585,It's a good call.
00:36:52.668,00:36:54.503,This is the right move.
00:36:54.587,00:36:55.588,- Yeah.
00:36:55.671,00:36:56.839,- Absolutely.
00:36:56.923,00:36:58.507,- Yep.
00:36:58.591,00:37:00.092,Good.
00:37:06.390,00:37:07.767,- All right.
00:37:07.850,00:37:08.768,Here we go.
00:37:08.851,00:37:10.019,- All right.
00:37:10.102,00:37:12.104,"Oh, it's a big one."
00:37:12.188,00:37:13.564,- Bottoms up.
00:37:13.648,00:37:15.650,- Bottoms up?
00:37:15.733,00:37:17.068,"Well, all right."
00:37:17.151,00:37:18.653,If you say so.
00:37:21.572,00:37:22.490,Ah.
00:37:22.573,00:37:24.283,Ooh!
00:37:26.118,00:37:27.286,Okay.
00:37:27.370,00:37:28.537,I want to do my final take again.
00:37:28.621,00:37:30.331,Is this thing still set?
00:37:30.414,00:37:31.499,- Yeah.
00:37:33.960,00:37:41.259,"- So, in summation, Buddy, I just want us-- let me start that over."
00:37:41.342,00:37:42.260,- You're doing good.
00:37:42.343,00:37:43.261,- You sure?
00:37:43.344,00:37:44.929,- Okay.
00:37:45.012,00:37:47.974,"So, in summation, Buddy, um..."
00:37:52.979,00:37:54.730,That didn't taste weird to you?
00:37:54.814,00:37:56.774,"- No, it was good."
00:37:56.857,00:37:58.150,Do you want another?
00:37:58.234,00:38:00.486,- No.
00:38:06.075,00:38:15.584,"So, in summation, Buddy, I love you, and I miss you."
00:38:16.961,00:38:19.005,I'm sorry I died.
00:38:24.010,00:38:25.261,"Just, it feels weird."
00:38:34.437,00:38:36.188,- Josef?
00:38:43.446,00:38:44.613,"- Oh, what'd you do?"
00:38:44.697,00:38:45.781,"What-- Aaron, what'd you do?"
00:38:45.865,00:38:46.782,Why did you do that?
00:38:46.866,00:38:47.783,"Aaron, why did you do that?"
00:38:47.867,00:38:49.368,"Aaron, what did you do?"
00:38:49.452,00:38:50.578,What did you do?
00:38:50.661,00:38:51.954,- It's okay.
00:38:52.038,00:38:54.081,Go to sleep.
00:38:52.038,00:38:55.583,Go to sleep It's okay.
00:39:00.838,00:39:03.382,"- Hello, Peachfuzz."
00:39:07.178,00:39:09.263,"Mmm, Peachfuzz."
00:39:09.347,00:39:11.140,"- No, Josef."
00:39:11.223,00:39:15.061,"- Mmm, Peachfuzz."
00:39:15.144,00:39:17.355,- Josef.
00:39:17.438,00:39:19.065,- Mmm.
00:39:22.276,00:39:25.738,You should come lay with me.
00:39:25.821,00:39:29.450,I'm tired.
00:39:29.533,00:39:31.327,I love you so much.
00:39:33.079,00:39:35.164,I'm so sorry.
00:39:39.377,00:39:40.878,Stay up all night.
00:41:05.004,00:41:06.505,- Hello?
00:41:06.589,00:41:08.174,- Hello?
00:41:08.257,00:41:09.592,- Angela?
00:41:09.675,00:41:11.469,- Josef?
00:41:11.552,00:41:13.554,"- No, this is Aaron."
00:41:13.637,00:41:16.390,- Oh.
00:41:16.474,00:41:20.186,- He's--he's sleeping.
00:41:20.269,00:41:22.480,"- I'm sorry, who is this?"
00:41:22.563,00:41:23.606,- Aaron.
00:41:23.689,00:41:25.566,Your husband hired me.
00:41:25.649,00:41:27.067,- What?
00:41:27.151,00:41:29.862,- Your husband hired me to film him.
00:41:29.945,00:41:31.822,For the cancer.
00:41:33.199,00:41:35.951,"- Where are you right now, Aaron?"
00:41:36.035,00:41:38.746,- We're at your house in Crestline.
00:41:38.829,00:41:39.747,- You're where?
00:41:39.830,00:41:41.749,"Ugh, okay."
00:41:41.832,00:41:43.542,Never mind.
00:41:43.626,00:41:48.631,"Listen, I'm gonna recommend that you go ahead and just leave right now."
00:41:48.714,00:41:50.299,- What the fuck's going on?
00:41:50.382,00:41:51.967,- Nothing.
00:41:52.051,00:41:56.180,You just go ahead and exit the house.
00:41:56.263,00:41:57.264,You will be fine.
00:41:57.348,00:41:58.599,"- Lady, I'm trying to leave."
00:41:58.682,00:42:00.434,I can't find my fucking car keys.
00:42:00.518,00:42:02.019,- Okay.
00:42:02.102,00:42:07.274,Just give me the address of where you are and then just walk out of there right now.
00:42:07.358,00:42:09.151,"Just keep walking, okay?"
00:42:10.653,00:42:12.655,- Am I in danger right now?
00:42:16.033,00:42:18.244,- My brother has problems.
00:42:19.870,00:42:23.582,- Brother?
00:42:23.666,00:42:27.211,Josef's your brother?
00:42:27.294,00:42:31.549,That's-- your brother has cancer?
00:42:31.632,00:42:33.968,"- Listen to me, Aaron."
00:42:34.051,00:42:41.225,You need to get out of that house right now-- - Hello? Hello?
00:42:42.393,00:42:44.270,Shit.
00:42:49.108,00:42:50.943,Oh.
00:43:27.646,00:43:29.148,Shit.
00:44:28.332,00:44:32.169,- Death.
00:44:32.252,00:44:34.296,- It's coming.
00:44:44.181,00:44:46.058,There's nothing we can do.
00:44:54.441,00:44:55.984,"I don't want to die, Aaron."
00:44:58.779,00:45:07.121,I don't want to-- I don't want to die.
00:45:07.204,00:45:09.331,"Oh, Aaron."
00:45:09.415,00:45:10.332,"Oh, God."
00:45:16.630,00:45:18.006,- I know.
00:45:18.090,00:45:19.925,- I know you know.
00:45:20.008,00:45:21.051,I love you.
00:45:21.135,00:45:22.052,You're such a good friend.
00:45:22.136,00:45:23.720,I love you so much.
00:45:27.099,00:45:28.600,- Josef.
00:45:32.187,00:45:33.397,I know.
00:45:33.480,00:45:35.524,- I know you know.
00:45:38.318,00:45:40.988,- Josef.
00:45:41.071,00:45:42.823,I know what's going on here.
00:45:45.617,00:45:47.327,I know you're troubled.
00:45:47.411,00:45:49.121,I'm willing to help.
00:45:52.291,00:45:54.126,"Look, I'm not angry."
00:45:56.128,00:46:02.009,"So, just give me my keys, and we'll-- we'll take it from there."
00:46:06.513,00:46:07.931,"I talked to Angela, man."
00:47:01.777,00:47:03.195,Josef.
00:47:04.321,00:47:05.948,Please let me go.
00:47:14.540,00:47:15.999,Are you gonna let me go?
00:47:19.753,00:47:21.922,Why are you doing this to me?
00:47:25.300,00:47:27.803,Are you--are you just trying to scare me?
00:47:27.886,00:47:31.265,"Or--okay, look."
00:47:31.348,00:47:33.850,"Well, I'm terrified, okay?"
00:47:33.934,00:47:36.103,You won.
00:47:37.771,00:47:40.232,"- Now, will you just please step aside and let me go?"
00:47:42.901,00:47:44.194,Stop.
00:47:44.278,00:47:46.196,Stop it.
00:47:46.280,00:47:47.531,Stop it!
00:47:48.532,00:47:49.449,Stop it!
00:47:50.534,00:47:51.451,- Stop it!
00:49:33.845,00:49:41.895,"Okay, um, so a little-- a little context here."
00:49:41.978,00:49:46.441,"After our scuffle, I don't know where he went."
00:49:46.525,00:49:47.859,He just ran off.
00:49:47.943,00:49:49.152,"I, uh..."
00:49:49.236,00:49:52.280,I had to get my car towed.
00:49:52.364,00:49:55.867,And now I'm home.
00:49:55.951,00:49:59.121,"And, you know, I-I thought this was over."
00:49:59.204,00:50:05.460,I was just writing it off as just a weird thing that happened.
00:50:05.544,00:50:19.015,"And, lo and behold, a few days later, I got this in the mail, which means he knows my address."
00:50:19.099,00:50:21.059,That's a little disconcerting.
00:50:28.316,00:50:30.485,"I don't know, I'm kind of having trouble interpreting it."
00:50:30.569,00:50:40.537,"I-I guess that's a-- he's supposed to be digging a grave there and, you know, there's these bags."
00:50:40.620,00:50:49.379,I don't know if that's supposed to be a body or something in the bags that's chopped up.
00:50:49.463,00:50:53.175,"Um, I don't know."
00:50:53.258,00:50:55.969,"I mean, is that supposed to be me?"
00:50:56.052,00:50:57.554,Okay.
00:50:57.637,00:50:58.805,No.
00:50:58.889,00:51:06.062,We are just going to get rid of this and pretend like it didn't happen.
00:51:10.817,00:51:12.444,There we go.
00:51:12.527,00:51:13.779,That's it.
00:51:18.241,00:51:19.743,Okay.
00:51:19.826,00:51:24.831,Maybe that's not it.
00:51:24.915,00:51:27.834,I've been having crazy ass dreams tonight.
00:51:30.712,00:51:35.300,"And it's me and Josef, and we're at the Heart Rock."
00:51:37.385,00:51:39.763,Only it's a hot tub.
00:51:39.846,00:51:51.775,"And we're just-- we're both sitting in it, and he's got the Peachfuzz mask on, and I don't think that's weird 'cause I have one on too."
00:51:51.858,00:51:56.613,Only mine's like a-- like a--like a baby mask.
00:51:56.696,00:51:59.157,Baby wolf.
00:51:59.241,00:52:03.745,And we're drinking wine.
00:52:03.829,00:52:12.587,"And then he leans over to me, and he just starts pouring the wine over my head."
00:52:12.671,00:52:23.390,"And I look down and I realize I'm-- I'm a little baby, and he's giving me a tubby."
00:52:23.473,00:52:27.602,And there's something weird about the water.
00:52:27.686,00:52:36.820,"I put my hand in it and reach up, and it's just covered in blood."
00:52:39.281,00:52:42.826,It's just a weird dream.
00:52:47.873,00:52:50.041,I got to stop thinking about this guy.
00:52:54.296,00:53:03.847,"Just heard the doorbell ring while I was in the bathroom, and the delivery guy left this on my doorstep."
00:53:05.974,00:53:12.856,"There's no return address, so I have a good idea who it's from."
00:54:22.509,00:54:23.718,- Hey.
00:54:23.802,00:54:29.683,"So, um, just to clear the air, I do want to apologize for that last video I sent you."
00:54:29.766,00:54:36.106,"It was a little manipulative and a bit of an emotional response and, um, I'm sorry about that."
00:54:36.189,00:54:42.988,"But in all fairness, I wasn't quite in my right head because, well, you did drug me."
00:54:43.071,00:54:50.787,"I found the empty Benadryl bottle in the house and, um, I got to say, pretty cool move."
00:54:50.870,00:55:01.131,"So, the way I see it is tit-for-tat, no hard feelings, but just in case, I thought I'd send you this little gift to clear the air between us and make sure we're cool."
00:55:01.214,00:55:05.510,I'm assuming by now you have the knife and you have the video you're watching.
00:55:05.593,00:55:11.057,"But if you haven't found the third element, I would encourage you to press pause now and dig a little deeper."
00:55:51.890,00:56:10.200,"I love wolves because they love deeply, but they don't know how to express it and they're often very violent and, quite frankly, murder the things that they love and inside of the wolf is this beautiful heart."
00:56:10.283,00:56:11.701,"And yeah, it's misguided."
00:56:11.785,00:56:19.167,"And yeah, occasionally it murders things and this little wolf was so cute, it reminded me of you honestly."
00:56:19.250,00:56:24.255,"You know, that moment I scared you in the woods, and it was--there was murder in your eyes, but it was, like-- it was baby murder."
00:56:24.339,00:56:26.382,You're not ready to accept that yet.
00:56:26.466,00:56:30.804,But I want to encourage you to embrace your inner wolf.
00:56:30.887,00:56:31.888,So take the wolf.
00:56:31.971,00:56:33.306,Enjoy it.
00:56:33.389,00:56:47.946,"And more importantly, take the knife and don't be afraid to murder it, because when you stick a knife in something and you gut it and you really dig inside, I don't know, man."
00:56:48.029,00:56:51.825,There's all this beautiful stuff.
00:56:51.908,00:56:54.119,"And, um..."
00:56:54.202,00:56:56.079,I got a little surprise for you in there.
00:56:59.499,00:57:01.042,"See you soon, buddy."
00:57:38.997,00:57:40.790,"- Oh, my God."
00:57:49.424,00:57:51.426,"Oh, my God."
00:57:57.974,00:57:59.350,"Oh, my God."
00:58:08.693,00:58:09.986,It's time to call the cops.
00:58:14.741,00:58:16.159,Hi. Hi.
00:58:16.242,00:58:17.869,My name is Aaron Franklin.
00:58:17.952,00:58:22.290,I'm calling to report a violent domestic incident and a stalker.
00:58:25.210,00:58:33.468,"Well, I don't know if he's dangerous-dangerous, but he's really weird and super creepy and I'm starting to get scared for my safety."
00:58:33.551,00:58:35.053,His name is Josef.
00:58:35.136,00:58:36.054,Or at least I think it is.
00:58:36.137,00:58:39.265,He lies a lot.
00:58:39.349,00:58:42.185,"No, I don't know-- I don't know his last name."
00:58:42.268,00:58:43.811,"No, I--I don't know where he lives."
00:58:43.895,00:58:50.193,"We met in a cabin he claimed was his, but I looked it up, and it's just some rental."
00:58:50.276,00:58:53.363,"No, I have no way of finding him or contacting him."
00:58:53.446,00:58:56.658,"Well, there must be something you can do."
00:58:56.741,00:58:59.160,Can't you send someone over to take fingerprints or something?
00:58:59.244,00:59:02.080,He--he sent me a heart locket and a knife.
00:59:02.163,00:59:05.667,You can use those.
00:59:05.750,00:59:07.460,"Well, I'm glad you're taking this seriously."
00:59:07.544,00:59:09.587,You guys have been entirely unhelpful.
00:59:09.671,00:59:11.798,I'm sure I'll be sleeping soundly tonight.
00:59:22.559,00:59:28.815,"So, I'm still having nightmares."
00:59:31.609,00:59:39.784,"It's, like, the same one over and over again, just slightly different."
00:59:56.426,01:00:15.820,"Anyway, it's like we're-- we're still in a hot tub, but the hot tub has, like, these, like, retractable spikes and when you sit down on 'em, it's like they push up-- Okay. Okay."
01:00:15.903,01:00:16.821,Okay.
01:00:16.904,01:00:18.114,Okay.
01:00:18.197,01:00:19.449,Lights.
01:00:19.532,01:00:21.993,Lights. Lights.
01:00:22.076,01:00:23.828,Lights.
01:00:34.255,01:00:35.840,Is anybody here?
01:00:40.428,01:00:42.096,Hello?
01:00:46.684,01:00:48.686,Josef?
01:00:53.983,01:00:55.943,Hello?
01:01:00.114,01:01:10.458,"If there's anyone trespassing on the premises, let it be known I have a knife."
01:01:12.794,01:01:15.338,I'm--I'm not afraid to use it.
01:01:18.966,01:01:24.597,I-- What was that?
01:02:05.179,01:02:06.556,Josef?
01:02:16.858,01:02:18.401,Hello?
01:02:28.786,01:02:29.996,Josef?
01:02:36.919,01:02:39.005,Is there anyone there?
01:03:08.201,01:03:09.827,God damn raccoons.
01:04:34.120,01:04:43.129,The last couple nights have been pretty normal until this.
01:04:43.212,01:04:44.630,This is where I sleep.
01:04:44.714,01:04:48.134,This is a broken screen in my window.
01:04:48.217,01:04:50.553,This is not good.
01:04:51.804,01:04:53.014,All right.
01:05:08.195,01:05:10.823,"- Hey, Aaron."
01:05:10.907,01:05:14.160,"I get this, you know, you get a grave digging video in the mail."
01:05:14.243,01:05:15.161,You throw it away.
01:05:15.244,01:05:16.537,That's not a big deal.
01:05:16.621,01:05:18.998,Um...
01:05:19.081,01:05:32.803,"This was harder for me to accept, and this hurt me because I made this for you, and it was representative of-- of our friendship and that bond that you and I made together at that Heart Rock right over there."
01:05:32.887,01:05:40.895,"And you threw it away and-- and when I found it in your trash can, I-I got my heart broken."
01:05:40.978,01:05:55.201,"And--and if I'm honest, it-- it sent me into a little spiral and-- and I had some inappropriate and wrong thoughts about what I wanted to do to you and to myself, honestly."
01:05:55.284,01:06:07.171,"And that was a red flag, and it scared me, and I-I thought a lot about it and--and I realized something, and it's that you were right."
01:06:07.254,01:06:11.842,"You know, you were right to throw that away, 'cause we're not friends."
01:06:11.926,01:06:23.312,"Our relationship was based on bullshit and lies that-- that I made up and--and-- and I'm sorry about that, and--and I want to be done with it, and that's why I'm talking to you today, okay?"
01:06:23.396,01:06:30.820,This is my attempt to be real and truthful and honest with you.
01:06:30.903,01:06:38.035,"And I'm not sure I'm capable of it, but-- but I'm gonna try, okay, to explain to you the truth."
01:06:38.119,01:06:45.793,"And the truth is, I..."
01:06:45.876,01:06:46.794,am...
01:06:53.801,01:06:55.261,"The truth is, I don't know."
01:06:55.344,01:06:56.846,"This is hard to talk about, you know?"
01:06:56.929,01:06:59.181,I-I don't know what's wrong with me.
01:06:59.265,01:07:00.266,I've always done this.
01:07:00.349,01:07:10.776,"I've--I've-- I've been pretending my-- my whole life and-- and then there was this phase where I was like, Hey, I'll just be an actor, because that's what actors do, pretend."
01:07:10.860,01:07:15.656,"So I went headlong into that, and then, you know, it did nothing for me because it wasn't real."
01:07:15.740,01:07:28.002,"Like, it--I could only get off on it unless it was real, and so I saw doctors, and some of them thought, Hey, you know, He's crazy, and some thought not, and there were medications, but none of that helped me."
01:07:31.547,01:07:35.968,And it's led me to a terrible place.
01:07:36.052,01:07:38.512,I don't have any friends.
01:07:38.596,01:07:40.389,I've burned every bridge.
01:07:40.473,01:07:43.142,My sisters.
01:07:43.225,01:07:46.604,"I have nothing, and I need somebody to talk to."
01:07:46.687,01:08:05.956,"And I'm hoping that your kindness is huge and that, even though I've burned that bridge and you have no reason to trust me at all, that you will give me a chance to talk to you and at the very least explain myself to you, and if you never want to see me again, that's fine."
01:08:06.040,01:08:07.500,At least we'll have closure.
01:08:07.583,01:08:10.920,But I'm gonna be here.
01:08:11.003,01:08:12.088,At Lake Gregory.
01:08:12.171,01:08:14.173,Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.
01:08:14.256,01:08:15.925,And it's a public place.
01:08:16.008,01:08:17.593,It's wide open.
01:08:17.676,01:08:23.390,"It's completely safe, and I promise you, you don't have to be afraid of me at all."
01:08:23.474,01:08:35.319,"I just want a chance to show you who I really am and the truth of me, because the truth is, I am a lonely person."
01:08:37.279,01:08:39.657,And I'm a sad person.
01:08:41.325,01:08:44.161,And I really need a friend.
01:08:44.245,01:08:46.664,And you're the only chance that I have.
01:09:03.264,01:09:05.224,- What the hell am I supposed to do with this?
01:09:16.735,01:09:18.154,Look at him.
01:09:21.907,01:09:23.617,He's so sad.
01:09:31.417,01:09:32.334,"All right, Josef."
01:09:32.418,01:09:34.211,I'm here.
01:09:34.295,01:09:35.963,You got me.
01:09:36.046,01:09:41.385,"But know that I'm filming this, and my phone is set to speed dial to 911."
01:12:27.760,01:12:29.428,It keeps getting better.
01:12:31.096,01:12:43.484,"I remember the first time I watched this, Aaron, and I thought to myself, Okay, it was smart that you filmed it, and it was smart that you put your phone on speed dial for the cops."
01:12:43.567,01:12:47.196,But why didn't you at least look behind you?
01:12:47.279,01:12:51.450,"I mean, it just seemed dumb that you would just sit there."
01:12:54.203,01:12:57.456,And then I realized why you didn't turn around.
01:12:59.583,01:13:04.880,"It's because you're the greatest person that's ever lived, Aaron."
01:13:04.963,01:13:15.933,"No matter what I did to you, you believed I was good and I would do you no harm."
01:13:18.352,01:13:24.525,And that is why I will always love you.
01:13:24.608,01:13:30.572,And why you'll always be my favorite of them all.
01:13:40.457,01:13:42.418,Mm-hmm.
01:13:52.553,01:13:55.973,Okay.
01:13:56.056,01:13:59.852,Everything's okay.
01:13:59.935,01:14:03.355,Not a care in the world.
01:14:03.439,01:14:05.816,It's all over.
01:14:19.663,01:14:21.748,Hello?
01:14:21.832,01:14:23.333,"Yes, this is Bill."
01:14:30.215,01:14:31.884,"The job is pretty simple, really."
01:14:31.967,01:14:38.182,"All you need is a video camera, yourself, and eight hours of your time."
01:14:38.265,01:14:41.310,Mm-hmm.
01:14:41.393,01:14:42.769,Great.
01:14:42.853,01:14:46.732,"Well, I look forward to meeting you."
01:14:46.815,01:14:48.275,Okay.
01:14:48.358,01:14:49.818,"All right, see you tomorrow, buddy."
