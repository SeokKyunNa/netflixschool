00:00:43.377,00:00:46.463,just like that.
00:00:46.463,00:00:49.967,There was nothing anybody could do.
00:00:49.967,00:00:51.969,It isn't fair.
00:00:51.969,00:00:53.762,There's no reason.
00:00:53.762,00:00:59.518,But if we start asking why we'll go crazy.

00:01:34.929,00:01:37.472,Microwave. Five minutes.
00:01:54.531,00:01:56.575,Here.
00:01:56.575,00:01:58.035,My shrink.

00:02:19.807,00:02:21.224,Hug a friend.
00:02:21.224,00:02:24.728,Or Work. Work hard.
00:02:24.728,00:02:28.899,Work is the only thing that will see you through this.
00:02:33.361,00:02:36.657,Don't mind him.
00:02:42.871,00:02:45.582,What I think we really need is...
00:02:45.582,00:02:46.875,change.
00:02:46.875,00:02:48.209,Good idea.
00:02:48.209,00:02:51.546,"Take a couple of weeks off, get some sun, take Jonah fishing."
00:02:54.549,00:02:57.011,No. Real change.
00:02:57.011,00:03:00.055,A new city.
00:03:00.055,00:03:03.684,Someplace where every time I go around a corner I don't think of Maggie.
00:03:12.734,00:03:15.154,Where are you going to go?
00:03:19.240,00:03:21.576,I was thinking about Seattle.
00:03:21.576,00:03:26.123,"Eventually, in a few months you'll start seeing women."
00:03:26.123,00:03:27.499,You'll meet someone.
00:03:27.499,00:03:29.001,"Right, right."
00:03:29.001,00:03:30.669,That's what I'm going to do.
00:03:30.669,00:03:32.921,"And then in a few months, boom, I'll be fine."
00:03:32.921,00:03:34.631,I'll just grow a new heart.
00:03:34.631,00:03:35.883,"Sam, I'm sorry."
00:03:35.883,00:03:37.217,"I know, I know."
00:03:37.217,00:03:39.720,"Look, it just doesn't happen twice."
00:05:30.164,00:05:32.624,The tall one with red hair is your cousin Irene...
00:05:32.624,00:05:35.043,You'll recognize her by the disappointed look on her face.
00:05:35.043,00:05:38.337,...who's married to Harold who ran off with his secretary.
00:05:38.337,00:05:42.467,But came back because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't.
00:05:42.467,00:05:45.804,Your brother Dennis is a professor at Johns Hopkins.
00:05:47.430,00:05:50.684,"He's married to, um... Betsy."
00:05:50.684,00:05:52.894,The most competitive woman in the world.
00:05:52.894,00:05:54.896,I don't see how I'm going to remember all this.
00:05:54.896,00:05:58.025,Oh. Well...
00:06:09.661,00:06:12.497,And your Uncle Milton lost all of his money...
00:06:12.497,00:06:14.249,And some other people's.
00:06:14.249,00:06:15.959,...in a pyramid scheme.
00:06:15.959,00:06:18.795,Don't mention the I.R.S.
00:06:18.795,00:06:22.549,"Your mother's Barbara, your father's Cliff..."
00:06:22.549,00:06:24.592,My father has electric trains.
00:06:24.592,00:06:26.761,Really?
00:06:26.761,00:06:30.057,Am I what they had in mind?
00:06:30.057,00:06:33.518,"Oh, Walter, they're going to love you!"
00:06:36.646,00:06:38.190,WOMAN: Everybody...
00:06:38.190,00:06:40.192,Annie has an announcement.
00:06:40.192,00:06:41.943,Oh...
00:06:41.943,00:06:45.072,Walter and I are engaged!
00:06:50.451,00:06:52.037,Thank you.
00:06:52.037,00:06:53.412,Thank you.
00:06:53.412,00:06:54.581,Mom knew.
00:06:54.581,00:06:56.124,"Dad, Mom knew."
00:06:56.124,00:06:59.169,"I don't see your ring, Annie."
00:06:59.169,00:07:00.879,"Congratulations, Walter."
00:07:03.257,00:07:04.758,Bless you.
00:07:07.344,00:07:09.346,Are you all right?
00:07:09.346,00:07:10.847,It's nothing.
00:07:10.847,00:07:13.600,Maybe it's the flowers.
00:07:13.600,00:07:15.435,"No, don't touch them!"
00:07:15.435,00:07:18.105,I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this.
00:07:18.105,00:07:20.065,This is a very important moment.
00:07:20.065,00:07:22.401,He's allergic to everything.
00:07:22.401,00:07:25.320,Bees. I'm allergic to bees.
00:07:25.320,00:07:28.240,Harold is allergic to every type of bee.
00:07:28.240,00:07:31.910,We always have to carry a hypodermic of adrenaline.
00:07:31.910,00:07:34.788,ANNIE: If he eats even one piece of a nut...
00:07:34.788,00:07:37.999,My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
00:07:37.999,00:07:40.419,IRENE: It's the same with Harold and bees.
00:07:40.419,00:07:45.424,Your mother and I had salmon at our wedding and a wedding without cold salmon...
00:07:45.424,00:07:47.217,I'm not allergic to salmon.
00:07:47.217,00:07:48.843,Oh! He's not allergic to salmon.
00:07:48.843,00:07:50.011,I don't think.
00:07:50.011,00:07:51.721,But you never know.
00:07:51.721,00:07:53.181,You never know.
00:07:53.181,00:07:55.016,Harold wasn't always allergic to bees.
00:07:55.016,00:07:59.020,"Oh, honey, what a shame, we had some champagne and what did we use it for?"
00:07:59.020,00:08:00.397,Uncle Milton's parole.
00:08:00.397,00:08:01.773,It was delicious.
00:08:01.773,00:08:03.358,"It was, wasn't it, Milton, darling?"
00:08:03.358,00:08:05.485,"When are you getting married, Annie?"
00:08:05.485,00:08:07.737,"In early June, in the garden."
00:08:07.737,00:08:09.323,Oh!
00:08:09.323,00:08:10.949,HAROLD: Does it have to be in the garden?
00:08:10.949,00:08:12.409,What about Harold and bees?
00:08:12.409,00:08:13.785,I'm allergic to bees.
00:08:13.785,00:08:15.287,BARBARA: We'll spray you.
00:08:15.287,00:08:20.292,"Cold salmon, a lovely cucumber salad strawberries..."
00:08:20.292,00:08:23.586,I'm afraid I am allergic to strawberries.
00:08:25.713,00:08:28.883,"Is this all right with you, Walter?"
00:08:28.883,00:08:35.223,Today I consider myself the luckiest man-man-man on the face-face-face of the earth-earth-earth.
00:08:35.223,00:08:36.766,The Lou Gehrig line!
00:08:36.766,00:08:40.687,"Remember, Dad, the Lou Gehrig line from, uh..."
00:08:40.687,00:08:43.190,Pride of the Yankees.
00:08:44.565,00:08:46.651,It's baseball.
00:08:46.651,00:08:49.029,I would like to propose a toast.
00:08:49.029,00:08:50.197,"Hear, hear."
00:08:50.197,00:08:51.572,To my kid sister.
00:08:51.572,00:08:54.075,To Walter and my baby.
00:08:54.075,00:08:55.994,To Walter and Annie.
00:08:58.621,00:09:03.043,"BARBARA: Everyone, please eat before it gets cold."
00:09:05.295,00:09:07.005,Here it is.
00:09:07.005,00:09:11.259,The historical society wanted this and I never would give it to them.
00:09:11.259,00:09:13.387,"ANNIE: Oh, Mom!"
00:09:13.387,00:09:16.390,I noticed these things are back in fashion.
00:09:16.390,00:09:18.099,Grandmother's dress.
00:09:18.099,00:09:19.267,"Oh, honey."
00:09:19.267,00:09:20.852,Oh!
00:09:20.852,00:09:22.937,"He's a lovely man, Annie."
00:09:22.937,00:09:24.314,I know!
00:09:24.314,00:09:26.566,"He is wonderful, isn't he?"
00:09:26.566,00:09:28.151,And he's such a wonderful athlete.
00:09:28.151,00:09:29.903,Are his folks nice?
00:09:29.903,00:09:32.113,You'll love them.
00:09:29.903,00:09:33.614,We're going to D.C. tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
00:09:33.614,00:09:34.824,How did it happen?
00:09:34.824,00:09:38.286,"Well... silly, really."
00:09:38.286,00:09:40.247,I'd seen him at the office.
00:09:40.247,00:09:42.874,He's the associate publisher...
00:09:42.874,00:09:53.301,"and then one day we'd ordered sandwiches from the same place and he got my lettuce and tomato on whole wheat, which he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white."
00:09:53.301,00:09:55.678,How amazing.
00:09:55.678,00:10:00.892,You make a million decisions that mean nothing and one day you order takeout and it changes your life.
00:10:00.892,00:10:02.936,Destiny takes a hand.
00:10:02.936,00:10:09.526,"Mom, destiny is something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental."
00:10:09.526,00:10:14.864,Then how do you explain that you both ordered the same sandwich except for the bread?
00:10:14.864,00:10:20.954,How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
00:10:20.954,00:10:22.372,Well...
00:10:22.372,00:10:23.831,it wasn't a sign.
00:10:23.831,00:10:26.293,It was a coincidence.
00:10:26.293,00:10:28.628,I was in Atlantic City with my family.
00:10:28.628,00:10:30.338,Cliff was a waiter.
00:10:30.338,00:10:35.176,He wasn't even supposed to work that night and suppose he hadn't?
00:10:35.176,00:10:39.264,He asked me to take a midnight walk on the steel pier.
00:10:39.264,00:10:43.602,"I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care."
00:10:43.602,00:10:47.730,Then he held my hand.
00:10:43.602,00:10:54.695,"At one point, I looked down and I couldn't tell which fingers were his and which were mine, and I knew."
00:10:54.695,00:10:56.114,What?
00:10:56.114,00:10:58.366,You know.
00:10:58.366,00:10:59.742,What?
00:10:59.742,00:11:01.995,Magic.
00:11:01.995,00:11:04.789,It was magic.
00:11:04.789,00:11:06.082,Magic?
00:11:06.082,00:11:10.378,"I knew we'd be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful..."
00:11:10.378,00:11:13.131,just the way you feel about Walter.
00:11:13.131,00:11:18.386,"Walter... it's quite a formal name, isn't it?"
00:11:18.386,00:11:24.643,One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time in...
00:11:24.643,00:11:27.061,"the sack, I believe you call it?"
00:11:27.061,00:11:28.271,Mom!
00:11:28.271,00:11:34.528,"Of course, it took several years before everything worked like clockwork, so don't be worried if it takes a while."
00:11:34.528,00:11:35.778,"Well, we already..."
00:11:35.778,00:11:38.114,"Fine, fine."
00:11:38.114,00:11:39.949,How's it working?
00:11:39.949,00:11:42.452,Like clockwork.
00:11:42.452,00:11:44.496,"Oh, honey."
00:11:47.415,00:11:49.042,It's a sign!
00:11:49.042,00:11:51.628,You don't believe in signs.
00:11:57.050,00:12:00.011,They loved you.
00:11:57.050,00:12:01.638,I told you they would love you and they loved you.
00:12:01.638,00:12:02.847,I love you.
00:12:02.847,00:12:05.058,"I love you, Walter."
00:12:06.893,00:12:09.770,Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
00:12:09.770,00:12:14.401,Nope.
00:12:14.401,00:12:16.361,Nope. Not even when I was young.
00:12:16.361,00:12:18.946,Huh.
00:12:18.946,00:12:20.532,You sure you don't want to drive with me?
00:12:20.532,00:12:22.701,How will I get back to Baltimore on Friday?
00:12:22.701,00:12:24.536,Ooh! I forgot the present.
00:12:24.536,00:12:27.955,I left your stepmother's present inside.
00:12:27.955,00:12:31.292,"When we're old and gray, you're going to have to remind me to put my teeth in."
00:12:31.292,00:12:36.005,I'll be walking all over town smacking my gums together and not even noticing.
00:12:36.005,00:12:37.257,I'll wait.
00:12:37.257,00:12:39.092,You'll wait...
00:12:39.092,00:12:41.302,"No, don't wait."
00:12:41.302,00:12:42.679,You go ahead.
00:12:42.679,00:12:45.973,I'll be ten minutes behind you.
00:13:15.754,00:13:17.880,Welcome back to You and Your Emotions.
00:13:17.880,00:13:24.011,"I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone, broadcasting live across America from the top of the Sears Tower in Chicago."
00:13:24.011,00:13:27.766,"Tonight, we're talking about wishes and dreams."
00:13:27.766,00:13:29.850,What's your wish this Christmas Eve?
00:13:29.850,00:13:34.689,What's your wish?
00:13:34.689,00:13:40.236,The subject of this evening's medical update is You and your spleen.
00:13:40.236,00:13:45.074,Jingle Bells backwards sung by the New Jersey Cape Mayettes.
00:13:45.074,00:13:46.451,"Seattle, go ahead."
00:13:46.451,00:13:50.789,"BOY: Hello. This is FIELDSTONE: No last names, Jonah."
00:13:50.789,00:13:54.125,You sound younger than our callers.
00:13:54.125,00:13:57.337,JONAH: I'm eight.
00:13:57.337,00:13:59.005,JONAH: It's not that late in Seattle.
00:13:59.005,00:14:00.839,FIELDSTONE: You're absolutely right.
00:14:00.839,00:14:03.092,"What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?"
00:14:03.092,00:14:05.094,JONAH: It's not for me.
00:14:05.094,00:14:06.805,He needs a new wife.
00:14:06.805,00:14:09.140,FIELDSTONE: You don't like the one he has now?
00:14:09.140,00:14:11.726,JONAH: He doesn't have one now.
00:14:11.726,00:14:14.354,FIELDSTONE: Where's your mom?
00:14:14.354,00:14:16.105,"FIELDSTONE: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that."
00:14:16.105,00:14:19.066,"Well, who can believe this?"
00:14:19.066,00:14:22.570,"JONAH: I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad's worse."
00:14:22.570,00:14:24.905,FIELDSTONE: Have you talked to your dad about this?
00:14:24.905,00:14:27.283,JONAH: No.
00:14:27.283,00:14:29.118,JONAH: It's like it makes him sadder.
00:14:29.118,00:14:32.789,FIELDSTONE: I can understand that.
00:14:32.789,00:14:35.375,JONAH: Yeah.
00:14:35.375,00:14:37.210,JONAH: He's out on the deck.
00:14:37.210,00:14:41.673,"FIELDSTONE: I'm sure that I can help, but I'm going to need you to help me help him."
00:14:41.673,00:14:43.090,Wretched woman!
00:14:43.090,00:14:45.301,FIELDSTONE: Bring your dad to the phone.
00:14:45.301,00:14:47.303,JONAH: No way. He'd kill me.
00:14:47.303,00:14:50.139,"FIELDSTONE: Trust me, Jonah."
00:14:47.303,00:14:52.684,He won't be angry when he realizes how concerned you are about him.
00:14:52.684,00:14:55.102,"Oh, want to bet?"
00:14:52.684,00:14:57.063,JONAH: If I get yelled at I'll never listen to your show again.
00:14:57.063,00:14:59.899,FIELDSTONE: Okay. Fair enough.
00:14:59.899,00:15:01.776,JONAH: Dad?
00:15:01.776,00:15:03.319,Yeah.
00:15:03.319,00:15:06.364,There's someone on the phone for you.
00:15:08.742,00:15:11.202,His name's Sam.
00:15:11.202,00:15:16.666,"FIELDSTONE: If you've just tuned in, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone and tonight's topic is Your wishes and dreams."
00:15:16.666,00:15:18.585,"Okay, I got it."
00:15:18.585,00:15:20.336,FIELDSTONE: We're on the line with someone from Seattle.
00:15:20.336,00:15:22.046,Hello.
00:15:22.046,00:15:25.842,This is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
00:15:25.842,00:15:28.177,Okay. What are you selling tonight?
00:15:28.177,00:15:30.555,Is it the micro-hibachis or the Ginza knives?
00:15:30.555,00:15:34.684,I'm not selling anything.
00:15:34.684,00:15:39.689,Your son called and he asked me for some advice on how you might find a new wife.
00:15:39.689,00:15:41.148,Who is this?
00:15:41.148,00:15:46.821,Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America and you are on the air.
00:15:46.821,00:15:48.406,You called a radio station?
00:15:48.406,00:15:51.117,"FIELDSTONE: Sam... Sam, are you with me?"
00:15:51.117,00:15:52.993,Yeah. Yes.
00:15:52.993,00:16:00.794,Your son feels that since your wife's death you've been very unhappy and he's genuinely worried about you.
00:16:00.794,00:16:02.754,"Oh, hey."
00:16:02.754,00:16:05.632,Get out here. I'm not going to go through this alone.
00:16:05.632,00:16:11.679,FIELDSTONE: It's very hard for him to talk to you about all this and I thought maybe you and I could talk.
00:16:11.679,00:16:15.057,Jonah would feel a little better.
00:16:15.057,00:16:17.727,"Talk to her, Dad."
00:16:17.727,00:16:20.772,Of what? Her first name could be doctor.
00:16:20.772,00:16:22.356,Please?
00:16:22.356,00:16:27.654,"Sam... Sam, it's his Christmas wish."
00:16:27.654,00:16:28.988,Okay.
00:16:28.988,00:16:31.282,FIELDSTONE: Okay. Good.
00:16:31.282,00:16:37.079,"Now, I know this is difficult, but how long ago did your wife die?"
00:16:37.079,00:16:39.206,About a year and a half ago.
00:16:39.206,00:16:43.252,FIELDSTONE: Oh. Have you had any relationships since?
00:16:43.252,00:16:44.754,No.
00:16:44.754,00:16:46.297,FIELDSTONE: No?
00:16:46.297,00:16:48.967,Why not?
00:16:48.967,00:16:50.551,"Uh, Marcia..."
00:16:50.551,00:16:52.345,Or should I call you Dr. Fieldstone?
00:16:52.345,00:16:53.763,FIELDSTONE: Dr. Marcia.
00:16:53.763,00:16:55.264,SAM: Dr. Marcia...
00:16:55.264,00:16:57.266,SAM: I don't mean to be rude.
00:16:57.266,00:16:59.894,"FIELDSTONE: Oh, and I don't want to invade your privacy."
00:16:59.894,00:17:01.896,SAM: Sure you do.
00:17:01.896,00:17:04.315,"FIELDSTONE: Go on, Sam."
00:17:05.525,00:17:07.694,Sam?
00:17:07.694,00:17:11.739,We had a pretty tough time there at first...
00:17:11.739,00:17:13.032,FIELDSTONE: Mm-hm.
00:17:13.032,00:17:15.994,but we're dealing with it.
00:17:15.994,00:17:25.252,And Jonah and I will get along just fine again as soon as I break his radio.
00:17:25.252,00:17:28.631,FIELDSTONE: I have no doubt that you're a wonderful father.
00:17:28.631,00:17:30.842,You can tell a lot from a person's voice.
00:17:30.842,00:17:32.259,You certainly can.
00:17:32.259,00:17:36.931,FIELDSTONE: But something must be missing if Jonah still feels that you're under a cloud.
00:17:36.931,00:17:40.685,Now just a few questions.
00:17:40.685,00:17:42.520,JONAH: He doesn't sleep at all.
00:17:42.520,00:17:43.897,How do you know that?
00:17:43.897,00:17:45.773,"I live here, Dad."
00:17:48.902,00:17:52.864,"Look, it's Christmas."
00:17:55.491,00:17:59.787,"Uh, Maggie..."
00:17:59.787,00:18:02.582,she really did it up.
00:18:02.582,00:18:05.919,"I mean, she loved..."
00:18:05.919,00:18:09.881,She made everything beautiful...
00:18:09.881,00:18:13.384,SAM: And it's just tough this time of year.
00:18:13.384,00:18:15.511,Any kid needs a mother.
00:18:15.511,00:18:20.600,FIELDSTONE: Could it be that you need someone just as much as Jonah does?
00:18:23.352,00:18:26.064,Yes.
00:18:26.064,00:18:28.608,Let's get into that after these messages.
00:18:28.608,00:18:30.484,"Sam, Jonah, don't go away."
00:18:30.484,00:18:39.493,"If you've just tuned in, we're talking to Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with your listener response."
00:18:39.493,00:18:41.161,What is she talking about?
00:18:41.161,00:18:44.331,This is when other people call in and dump on what you said.
00:18:44.331,00:18:46.333,Oh... oh.
00:18:46.333,00:18:48.335,"Well, this is really fun."
00:18:48.335,00:18:50.212,And helpful.
00:18:56.052,00:18:57.971,WOMAN: I'll bet he's tall with a cute butt.
00:18:57.971,00:19:00.514,Bet he hasn't bathed in weeks and he stinks.
00:19:00.514,00:19:03.017,"Harriet, shut up."
00:19:03.017,00:19:04.685,Tea with the bag out.
00:19:04.685,00:19:07.396,Maybe I'll hustle to Seattle...
00:19:07.396,00:19:08.815,give him a little gift for New Year's Eve.
00:19:08.815,00:19:12.568,"Yeah, you go, but don't open his refrigerator."
00:19:12.568,00:19:15.113,Nothing's covered.
00:19:15.113,00:19:18.491,They just stick it in there and leave it till it walks out by itself.
00:19:18.491,00:19:23.454,I'm saying I wouldn't kick this guy out of my bed for eating crackers.
00:19:23.454,00:19:26.290,Let's take a call before we get back to Sleepless.
00:19:26.290,00:19:30.169,"Knoxville, Tennessee, you're on the air."
00:19:30.169,00:19:34.548,WOMAN: Yes. Where could I get this man's address?
00:19:34.548,00:19:36.509,"Hmph. Honey, get in line."
00:19:36.509,00:19:38.385,FIELDSTONE: We don't give addresses out on the air.
00:19:38.385,00:19:40.680,Next caller. Oakland...
00:19:40.680,00:19:44.142,If there was one question I was allowed to ask...
00:19:44.142,00:19:45.935,"Oh, go ahead."
00:19:45.935,00:19:50.148,FIELDSTONE: People who truly loved once are far more likely to love again.
00:19:50.148,00:19:55.069,"Sam, do you think that there's someone out there you could love as much as your wife?"
00:19:57.446,00:20:01.534,"Well, Dr. Marcia Fieldstone, it's hard to imagine."
00:20:01.534,00:20:05.038,FIELDSTONE: Mm-hm.
00:20:05.038,00:20:30.938,"Well, I'm going to get out of bed every morning, breathe in and out all day long and then after a while I won't have to remind myself to get out of bed in the morning and breathe in and out, and then after a while I won't have to think about how I had it great and perfect for a while."
00:20:30.938,00:20:35.609,"FIELDSTONE: Sam, tell me what was so special about your wife."
00:20:35.609,00:20:40.031,"SAM: Well, how long is your program?"
00:20:40.031,00:20:46.328,"Oh... Well, it was a million tiny little things."
00:20:46.328,00:20:48.206,When you add them all up...
00:20:48.206,00:20:50.833,it just meant that we were supposed to be together.
00:20:50.833,00:20:52.376,And I knew it.
00:20:52.376,00:20:55.588,I knew it the very first time I touched her.
00:20:55.588,00:21:01.719,"It was like coming home, only to no home I'd ever known."
00:21:01.719,00:21:10.811,"I was just taking her hand to help her out of a car, and I knew it."
00:21:10.811,00:21:13.106,It was like...
00:21:13.106,00:21:16.109,SAM: Magic.
00:21:16.109,00:21:19.403,"FIELDSTONE: Well, folks, it's time to wrap it up."
00:21:19.403,00:21:26.786,"I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone in Chicago and to all my listeners, a magical and merry Christmas."
00:21:26.786,00:21:34.043,"And to you, Sleepless in Seattle, we hope you'll call again soon and let us know how it's going."
00:21:34.043,00:21:36.295,"SAM: Oh, you can count on it."
00:22:25.385,00:22:30.557,"MAN: This man sells the greatest soup you've ever eaten, and he is the meanest man in America."
00:22:30.557,00:22:32.518,"I feel very strongly about this, Becky."
00:22:32.518,00:22:35.353,It's not just about the soup.
00:22:35.353,00:22:39.108,New Year's Eve.
00:22:39.108,00:22:46.907,Phone service in the Chicago area was tied up for two hours Christmas Eve when some kid calls a radio show and says his dad needs a new wife.
00:22:46.907,00:22:51.078,"2,000 women called the station asking for the guy's number."
00:22:51.078,00:22:54.414,"I heard it. This kid says, My dad needs a wife."
00:22:54.414,00:22:58.460,"And the shrinkette practically forces the guy onto the phone and says, Do you want to talk about it?"
00:22:58.460,00:23:00.713,"And he says, No."
00:23:00.713,00:23:08.179,"And suddenly, he starts talking about his wife and how he just fell in love with her like he was one of those cows in Michigan."
00:23:08.179,00:23:11.224,What cows in Michigan?
00:23:11.224,00:23:14.310,Those cows got zapped by voltage.
00:23:14.310,00:23:16.270,Maybe it was Wisconsin.
00:23:16.270,00:23:22.985,"Anyway, I was listening to him talk about how much he loved his wife and suddenly, I was crying."
00:23:22.985,00:23:25.321,It's what happens when I watch those phone company ads.
00:23:25.321,00:23:26.864,I don't have to see the whole thing...
00:23:26.864,00:23:30.951,just the part where the daughter gives the mother the refrigerator with the big red bow.
00:23:30.951,00:23:32.578,The Polaroid commercial?
00:23:32.578,00:23:34.663,Two five-year-olds at their grandfather's birthday.
00:23:34.663,00:23:35.915,They're making the album.
00:23:35.915,00:23:38.416,With the glue.
00:23:40.336,00:23:42.213,You should write something about this.
00:23:42.213,00:23:45.925,About what?
00:23:45.925,00:23:48.386,"2,000 women calling a radio station for a husband?"
00:23:48.386,00:23:50.388,A lot of desperate women are looking for love.
00:23:50.388,00:23:52.348,Especially over a certain age.
00:23:52.348,00:23:55.935,It's easier to be killed by a terrorist than it is to get married over 40.
00:23:55.935,00:23:57.603,That statistic is not true.
00:23:57.603,00:23:59.437,That's right.
00:23:59.437,00:24:01.982,But it feels true.
00:24:01.982,00:24:04.985,There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true.
00:24:04.985,00:24:06.444,Calm down.
00:24:06.444,00:24:09.031,I did not. Did you even read that book?
00:24:09.031,00:24:11.200,Did anybody read that book all the way through?
00:24:11.200,00:24:14.578,Are you finished?
00:24:14.578,00:24:18.416,If someone is a widower why do they say that he was widowed?
00:24:18.416,00:24:21.668,Why don't they say he was widowered?
00:24:23.170,00:24:26.173,I was just wondering.
00:24:26.173,00:24:27.967,What was that about up there?
00:24:27.967,00:24:29.509,What was what?
00:24:29.509,00:24:31.011,What's with you?
00:24:31.011,00:24:33.055,Nothing's with me.
00:24:33.055,00:24:34.807,Something's with you.
00:24:34.807,00:24:36.474,What are you saying?
00:24:36.474,00:24:38.727,"Whatever it is, you can tell me."
00:24:38.727,00:24:40.187,Sleepless in Seattle?
00:24:40.187,00:24:42.982,She called him that because he can't sleep.
00:24:42.982,00:24:45.734,"And now 2,000 women want his number."
00:24:45.734,00:24:53.867,"The guy could be a crack-head, a transvestite, a flasher, a junkie, a chain saw murderer or someone really sick..."
00:24:53.867,00:24:55.244,someone like my Rick.
00:24:56.536,00:24:58.705,"Actually, he sounded nice."
00:24:58.705,00:25:00.666,Oh?
00:25:00.666,00:25:02.709,"Oh, really."
00:25:02.709,00:25:05.296,Now we're getting down to it.
00:25:05.296,00:25:08.007,"Please, Becky."
00:25:08.007,00:25:12.719,He did the craziest thing the other night.
00:25:12.719,00:25:16.807,"Oh, it was so funny."
00:25:20.311,00:25:21.687,Hm.
00:25:29.028,00:25:34.492,"You know, I'm thinking I've got to go up to Boston for the A.A.B. Convention."
00:25:34.492,00:25:38.745,Then I've got to visit Winston Hughes about switching over our computers.
00:25:38.745,00:25:43.209,Why don't we meet in New York Valentine's Day weekend?
00:25:43.209,00:25:46.337,"Walter, I'd love to."
00:25:46.337,00:25:49.006,Hm? We can stay at the Plaza.
00:25:49.006,00:25:51.425,Ice-skate in Central Park.
00:25:51.425,00:25:53.760,Register.
00:25:53.760,00:25:55.721,Register?
00:25:55.721,00:25:58.932,"You know, for dishes, glasses, silver..."
00:25:58.932,00:26:01.268,everything. Hm?
00:26:03.312,00:26:05.189,How about it?
00:26:07.483,00:26:10.403,I'll take you to Chinatown for dim sum.
00:26:10.403,00:26:12.029,Does it have wheat in it?
00:26:12.029,00:26:13.947,I don't think so.
00:26:22.164,00:26:24.624,CROWD: Ten... nine...
00:26:24.624,00:26:27.127,eight... seven... six...
00:26:27.127,00:26:31.507,five... four... three...
00:26:31.507,00:26:33.842,"Hey, Jonah."
00:26:33.842,00:26:35.677,The ball's dropping.
00:26:35.677,00:26:38.138,Happy New Year!
00:26:44.602,00:26:47.440,"Okay, pal."
00:26:47.440,00:26:50.401,It's okay.
00:26:52.694,00:26:55.072,"Oh, yeah."
00:27:23.809,00:27:26.979,Happy New Year.
00:27:26.979,00:27:29.106,Happy New Year.
00:27:31.858,00:27:34.361,Kiss Howard.
00:27:34.361,00:27:36.196,"Good night, Howard."
00:29:08.372,00:29:11.500,Can I have half your beer?
00:29:11.500,00:29:13.711,Sure. Go ahead.
00:29:16.129,00:29:19.049,What did I use to say?
00:29:19.049,00:29:21.510,Here's looking at you?
00:29:21.510,00:29:23.470,Here's mud in your eye.
00:29:23.470,00:29:26.014,Here's to us.
00:29:26.014,00:29:29.809,"You used to say, Here's to us."
00:29:33.939,00:29:37.276,"Oh, babe I miss you so much, it hurts."
00:29:55.753,00:29:57.713,What do you want to do?
00:29:57.713,00:29:59.214,You want to tell him?
00:29:59.214,00:30:00.466,I don't mind...
00:30:00.466,00:30:02.884,She's back.
00:30:02.884,00:30:04.136,"No, no..."
00:30:04.136,00:30:05.804,"Sam, I'm so glad you're here."
00:30:05.804,00:30:07.347,I heard you on the radio.
00:30:07.347,00:30:09.182,I told everyone about it.
00:30:09.182,00:30:10.934,We already knew.
00:30:10.934,00:30:12.352,How?
00:30:12.352,00:30:14.980,The dispatcher?
00:30:14.980,00:30:18.233,"I was brushing my teeth, and suddenly there you were."
00:30:18.233,00:30:20.611,I called my mother in Las Vegas.
00:30:20.611,00:30:23.530,"I said, Mother, turn on the radio."
00:30:23.530,00:30:26.116,That's my architect.
00:30:26.116,00:30:31.538,It is so nice when a man can express his feelings.
00:30:31.538,00:30:32.831,It's wonderful.
00:30:32.831,00:30:34.333,"Yeah, I wish I could express my feelings."
00:30:34.333,00:30:36.376,"So, Claire, is there a problem?"
00:30:36.376,00:30:38.420,I was just tossing and turning last night...
00:30:38.420,00:30:40.005,You know what that's like.
00:30:40.005,00:30:45.302,Because I realized I'll never fit my platters in that refrigerator we ordered.
00:30:45.302,00:30:47.304,"And when I give parties, I always put in platters."
00:30:47.304,00:30:50.599,"So, I thought I would get the Sub-Zero refrigerator instead."
00:30:50.599,00:30:51.850,The only problem...
00:30:51.850,00:30:54.728,We have to redo all the cabinets.
00:30:54.728,00:30:57.648,We'll be into this wall.
00:30:57.648,00:30:59.191,That's a delay...
00:30:59.191,00:31:01.401,"of two, three..."
00:31:01.401,00:31:03.195,12 weeks.
00:31:03.195,00:31:05.739,The important thing is to get it right.
00:31:05.739,00:31:07.366,Absolutely.
00:31:07.366,00:31:10.410,I've got to rush.
00:31:10.410,00:31:11.704,Bye.
00:31:11.704,00:31:13.038,Bye.
00:31:16.291,00:31:18.627,This is fate.
00:31:18.627,00:31:21.129,She's divorced. We don't want to redo the cabinets.
00:31:21.129,00:31:23.965,What do they call that when everything intersects?
00:31:23.965,00:31:25.884,The Bermuda Triangle.
00:31:35.018,00:31:37.145,MAN: And there's another one.
00:31:37.145,00:31:39.356,You got room for one more here?
00:31:39.356,00:31:40.940,There you go.
00:31:40.940,00:31:43.276,"Look at this, Dad."
00:31:43.276,00:31:44.737,Here you go.
00:31:48.365,00:31:51.034,"Sleepless in Seattle, care of Dr. Marcia Fieldstone."
00:31:51.034,00:31:55.914,"If you're having trouble sleeping, try drinking a glass of water from the other side."
00:31:55.914,00:31:57.457,I thought that was for hiccups.
00:31:57.457,00:31:58.751,Does it work for hiccups?
00:31:58.751,00:32:02.379,"For hiccups, take a spoonful of sugar and hold it in your mouth for a minute."
00:32:02.379,00:32:04.005,Really?
00:32:04.005,00:32:06.341,Thank you.
00:32:06.341,00:32:08.677,What possessed you to give them our address?
00:32:08.677,00:32:12.013,They called and asked for it.
00:32:12.013,00:32:17.352,"Dear Sleepless in Seattle, You're the most attractive man I ever laid ears on."
00:32:17.352,00:32:21.398,Wait. They called?
00:32:21.398,00:32:23.734,"Oh, let me guess..."
00:32:23.734,00:32:27.112,You have to or they won't let you on the air.
00:32:27.112,00:32:29.865,"Dear Sleepless in Seattle, I live in Tulsa."
00:32:29.865,00:32:32.826,Where's that?
00:32:32.826,00:32:34.828,Do you know where Oklahoma is?
00:32:34.828,00:32:38.248,Somewhere in the middle?
00:32:34.828,00:32:41.251,I won't even think about what they're not teaching in school.
00:32:41.251,00:32:43.128,"Yeah, somewhere in the middle."
00:32:43.128,00:32:47.507,We should rule out anyone that doesn't live near here.
00:32:47.507,00:32:49.843,She's willing to fly anywhere.
00:32:51.261,00:32:55.682,She looks like my third grade teacher and I hated my third grade teacher. Wait a minute.
00:32:55.682,00:32:58.811,She is my third grade teacher!
00:32:58.811,00:33:00.479,Won't you read any of these?
00:33:00.479,00:33:03.273,"No, because this is not how it's done."
00:33:03.273,00:33:11.531,I'd much rather just see somebody I like and get a feeling about them and ask them if they want to have a drink.
00:33:11.531,00:33:13.408,Or a slice of pizza?
00:33:13.408,00:33:18.956,"Not dinner on the first date, because halfway through dinner you could be sorry you asked them to dinner."
00:33:18.956,00:33:26.379,"If it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them to dinner but if not, you can just say, Well, that was great."
00:33:26.379,00:33:29.257,And go home.
00:33:31.259,00:33:33.553,I wonder if it still works this way.
00:33:33.553,00:33:35.722,It doesn't. They ask you.
00:33:35.722,00:33:37.850,I'm starting to notice that.
00:33:37.850,00:33:42.228,"If you get a new wife I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?"
00:33:42.228,00:33:44.815,I certainly hope so.
00:33:44.815,00:33:47.233,Will she scratch up your back?
00:33:47.233,00:33:49.486,What?
00:33:49.486,00:33:54.157,"In movies, women are always scratching up the men's back and screaming and stuff when they're having sex."
00:33:54.157,00:33:55.575,How do you know this?
00:33:55.575,00:33:57.494,Jed's got cable.
00:33:57.494,00:33:58.912,"Oh, Jed's..."
00:34:01.206,00:34:03.709,Hand me that towel behind you.
00:34:08.380,00:34:10.340,Thank you.
00:34:10.340,00:34:12.551,"Here, let me get you."
00:34:12.551,00:34:14.594,Jed's got cable.
00:34:43.498,00:35:47.771,"MORNING PERFORMED BY Welcome back to the best of Dr. Marcia Fieldstone, clinical psychologist and the friend you never had."
00:35:47.771,00:35:49.731,Remember Marooned in Miami?
00:35:49.731,00:35:51.858,WOMAN: He says he doesn't love me anymore.
00:35:51.858,00:35:55.278,FIELDSTONE: Why would you want to be with someone who doesn't love you?
00:35:55.278,00:35:57.030,MALE ANNOUNCER: Disappointed in Denver.
00:35:57.030,00:36:01.034,WOMAN: Every time I come close to orgasm he goes to make himself a sandwich.
00:36:01.034,00:36:03.411,FIELDSTONE: Why don't you make him a sandwich beforehand?
00:36:03.411,00:36:05.455,ANNOUNCER: Sleepless in Seattle.
00:36:05.455,00:36:25.183,"SAM: I'm going to get out of bed every morning, breathe in and out all day long, and then after a while, I won't have to remind myself to get out of bed in the morning and breathe in and out."
00:36:25.183,00:36:34.860,"And then after a while, I won't have to think about how I had it great and perfect for a while."
00:36:34.860,00:36:39.572,"FIELDSTONE: Sam, tell me what was so special about your wife."
00:36:39.572,00:36:42.450,"SAM: Well, how long is your program?"
00:36:44.243,00:36:55.088,"Oh, well, it was a million tiny little things, and when you add them all up it just meant we were supposed to be together, that's all."
00:36:55.088,00:36:56.631,And I knew it.
00:36:56.631,00:36:59.926,I knew it the very first time I touched her.
00:36:59.926,00:37:05.807,"It was like coming home, only to no home I'd ever known."
00:37:05.807,00:37:14.900,"I was just taking her hand to help her out of a car, and I knew it."
00:37:14.900,00:37:19.946,It was like... magic.
00:37:40.967,00:37:43.678,"Well, I think I'm going crazy, Dennis."
00:37:43.678,00:37:45.097,Are you happily married?
00:37:45.097,00:37:46.264,What?
00:37:46.264,00:37:48.225,"I mean, why did you get married?"
00:37:48.225,00:37:51.144,Was it all trumpets and fireworks?
00:37:51.144,00:37:55.857,I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married. So we got married.
00:37:55.857,00:38:04.116,"But when you first met her did you believe that she was the only person for you, that in some, mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?"
00:38:04.116,00:38:11.206,"Annie, when you're attracted to someone it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious..."
00:38:11.206,00:38:12.707,subconsciously.
00:38:12.707,00:38:16.836,So fate is just two neuroses knowing they're a perfect match.
00:38:18.463,00:38:20.048,I don't even know him.
00:38:20.048,00:38:27.139,"I am having all of these fantasies about some man I have never even met, who lives in Seattle."
00:38:27.139,00:38:29.390,It rains nine months straight there.
00:38:29.390,00:38:31.101,"I know, I know!"
00:38:31.101,00:38:33.478,I do not want to move to Seattle.
00:38:36.982,00:38:43.863,But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something.
00:38:43.863,00:38:46.116,What do you think?
00:38:46.116,00:38:48.034,It's just cold feet isn't it?
00:38:48.034,00:38:50.328,Everybody panics before they get married.
00:38:50.328,00:38:51.579,Didn't you?
00:38:51.579,00:38:53.165,"Yes, I did."
00:38:53.165,00:38:55.292,"Yes, you did."
00:38:55.292,00:38:57.543,I feel so much better having blown this off.
00:38:57.543,00:38:59.171,Anytime.
00:38:59.171,00:39:02.924,"Sandy has a girlfriend, Glenda."
00:39:02.924,00:39:05.802,It's not like her neck is bigger than her head...
00:39:05.802,00:39:08.721,I'm not asking you to set me up.
00:39:08.721,00:39:12.142,I just want to know what it's like out there.
00:39:12.142,00:39:13.434,That's what I'm trying to tell you...
00:39:13.434,00:39:14.769,what women are looking for.
00:39:14.769,00:39:17.314,Pecs and a cute butt.
00:39:17.314,00:39:19.607,"You mean, like, He has the cutest butt?"
00:39:19.607,00:39:21.734,Yeah.
00:39:21.734,00:39:28.616,Everywhere. You can't even turn on the news without hearing about how some babe thought some guy's butt was cute.
00:39:28.616,00:39:32.411,"Who the first woman to say this was, I don't know, but somehow it caught on."
00:39:32.411,00:39:34.331,So how's my butt?
00:39:37.125,00:39:38.168,Not bad.
00:39:38.168,00:39:39.418,Really?
00:39:39.418,00:39:41.046,Is it cute though?
00:39:41.046,00:39:43.464,I don't know.
00:39:43.464,00:39:47.719,When's the last time you were out there?
00:39:47.719,00:39:53.808,Uh... uh...
00:39:53.808,00:39:56.353,Things are a little different now.
00:39:56.353,00:39:58.063,"First, you have to be friends."
00:39:58.063,00:39:59.981,You have to like each other.
00:39:59.981,00:40:01.482,Then you neck.
00:40:01.482,00:40:03.609,This could go on for years.
00:40:03.609,00:40:06.696,Then you have tests.
00:40:06.696,00:40:08.865,The good news is you split the check.
00:40:08.865,00:40:12.202,I don't think I could let a woman pay for dinner.
00:40:12.202,00:40:14.871,Great. They'll throw a parade in your honor.
00:40:14.871,00:40:17.874,You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.
00:40:19.292,00:40:21.253,Tiramisu.
00:40:21.253,00:40:22.587,What is tiramisu?
00:40:22.587,00:40:24.172,You'll find out.
00:40:24.172,00:40:26.174,"Well, what is it?"
00:40:26.174,00:40:29.135,Some woman is going to want me to do it and I won't know what it is.
00:40:29.135,00:40:30.636,You'll love it.
00:40:30.636,00:40:34.224,"This is going to be tough. Tough, tough."
00:40:34.224,00:40:36.059,Much tougher than I thought it was going to be.
00:40:36.059,00:40:39.729,What about that decorator on the Bennett job?
00:40:39.729,00:40:41.898,Victoria.
00:40:43.108,00:40:44.359,"Aw, no..."
00:40:44.359,00:40:47.570,What? What?
00:40:47.570,00:40:51.408,I'm not used to-- How would I do that?
00:40:51.408,00:40:54.244,"You call her up and say, Let's look at swatches."
00:40:54.244,00:40:57.247,"Call her and say, Come, let's look at swatches."
00:40:57.247,00:40:58.581,"Yeah, color schemes."
00:40:58.581,00:41:01.251,She's not going to see through that?
00:41:01.251,00:41:03.336,Do it in your own suave way.
00:41:03.336,00:41:05.797,Think Cary Grant.
00:41:05.797,00:41:10.218,"Cary Grant would call up and say, Come over and look at my swatches?"
00:41:10.218,00:41:13.596,Maybe he did. I know he didn't do it in the movie.
00:41:13.596,00:41:15.014,Gunga Din?
00:41:15.014,00:41:17.683,Gunga Din is not a swatch kind of movie.
00:41:17.683,00:41:20.019,Who knows what he did in real life?
00:41:20.019,00:41:23.022,He did that with Dyan Cannon? Sure.
00:41:23.022,00:41:25.858,"Hello, Dyan. Take a look at these swatches."
00:41:44.294,00:41:46.629,"Jonah, I'm home."
00:41:49.632,00:41:51.968,"Hey, Jonah."
00:41:58.433,00:42:00.477,Jonah?
00:42:02.437,00:42:04.814,"Hey, Jonah?"
00:42:05.982,00:42:07.942,"Hey, Jonah?"
00:42:10.236,00:42:11.904,"Hi, Dad."
00:42:14.199,00:42:16.368,It's nice to meet you.
00:42:16.368,00:42:21.206,"Dad, this is amazing. If you play this backwards it says, Paul is dead."
00:42:21.206,00:42:24.583,"Uh, yeah, yeah, I know."
00:42:24.583,00:42:26.461,How do you know?
00:42:28.505,00:42:31.132,"Dad, could you shut the door?"
00:42:31.132,00:42:33.592,"Sure, sure."
00:42:33.592,00:42:36.846,H and G.
00:42:36.846,00:42:39.474,Hi and good-bye.
00:43:52.338,00:43:55.300,"Hello, Victoria? Ahem."
00:43:55.300,00:43:56.759,This is Sam Baldwin.
00:43:56.759,00:44:00.555,"I don't know if you remember me, but..."
00:44:00.555,00:44:02.265,"Oh. Oh, great."
00:44:02.265,00:44:07.437,"Hi. Uh... I, uh..."
00:44:07.437,00:44:08.980,"if... if, uh..."
00:44:08.980,00:44:11.941,if you would like to have a drink with me.
00:44:11.941,00:44:13.734,Dinner?
00:44:14.819,00:44:18.364,Dinner would be even better.
00:44:18.364,00:44:21.284,"Friday would be great, yeah."
00:44:21.284,00:44:23.953,I hear that's a good place.
00:44:26.831,00:44:33.379,"7:30 would be... would be fine, and I'll, uh... I'll, uh..."
00:44:33.379,00:44:35.548,"Okay, I'll meet you there."
00:44:35.548,00:44:36.799,"Okay, all right."
00:44:36.799,00:44:38.884,"Um, so this..."
00:44:38.884,00:44:41.887,Uh... it's Friday at 7:30.
00:44:41.887,00:44:43.598,For dinner. Great.
00:44:45.850,00:44:47.477,Me too. Bye.
00:44:54.775,00:44:56.569,Are you in love with him?
00:44:59.614,00:45:02.116,I'm not now.
00:45:02.116,00:45:05.953,"Now, those were the days when people knew how to be in love."
00:45:05.953,00:45:08.206,You're a basket case.
00:45:08.206,00:45:11.083,"Time, distance..."
00:45:08.206,00:45:14.753,"Nothing could separate them because they knew it was right, it was real, it was..."
00:45:14.753,00:45:16.673,A movie.
00:45:16.673,00:45:18.675,That's your problem.
00:45:18.675,00:45:20.843,You want to be in love in a movie.
00:45:20.843,00:45:23.012,Read it to me.
00:45:24.389,00:45:28.393,"Dear Sleepless and son, I have never written a letter like this in my life..."
00:45:28.393,00:45:32.104,That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
00:45:32.104,00:45:35.567,You think I don't know that?
00:45:35.567,00:45:36.942,What about Walter?
00:45:37.985,00:45:39.404,Walter.
00:45:39.404,00:45:42.407,"Oh, I would give anything to marry Walter."
00:45:42.407,00:45:44.701,He's so... unexpected.
00:45:44.701,00:45:49.539,"You think you can tell what he's like by just looking at him, but you can't."
00:45:49.539,00:45:52.250,I should write something in this about magic.
00:45:52.250,00:45:54.877,What?
00:45:54.877,00:45:57.630,What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
00:45:57.630,00:46:00.757,Your destiny can be your doom.
00:46:00.757,00:46:02.801,I want to meet you...
00:46:02.801,00:46:04.429,GRANT: How about the top of the Empire State Building?
00:46:04.429,00:46:06.305,On the top of the Empire State Building.
00:46:06.305,00:46:09.808,"Yes, that's perfect."
00:46:11.561,00:46:15.898,I'll be in New York with Walter.
00:46:15.898,00:46:19.110,I'll be in New York with Walter.
00:46:26.117,00:46:29.495,Want to hear about destiny?
00:46:26.117,00:46:31.872,"If I hadn't married Martin, I never would have bought the house with the dead tree."
00:46:31.872,00:46:33.958,"On account of which, I got divorced."
00:46:33.958,00:46:37.920,On account of which I hit a car and met Rick while buying a neck brace.
00:46:37.920,00:46:43.509,"Wait a minute, You never told me you got a divorce because of a dead tree."
00:46:43.509,00:46:45.094,The tree man.
00:46:45.094,00:46:46.929,You fell in love with the tree man?
00:46:46.929,00:46:50.182,I did not say love.
00:46:50.182,00:46:53.645,This is my favorite part.
00:46:53.645,00:46:56.939,It's now or never.
00:46:56.939,00:47:00.401,Never is a frightening word.
00:47:00.401,00:47:05.615,We'd be fools to let happiness pass us by.
00:47:05.615,00:47:11.162,KERR: Winter must be cold for those with no warm memories.
00:47:12.871,00:47:16.417,We've already missed the spring.
00:47:16.417,00:47:18.127,GRANT: Yes.
00:47:18.127,00:47:20.171,Men never get this movie.
00:47:20.171,00:47:23.549,I know.
00:47:23.549,00:47:27.219,JONAH: Mommy! Mommy!
00:47:29.305,00:47:31.307,Mommy!
00:47:31.307,00:47:33.267,I'm here.
00:47:33.267,00:47:34.769,I'm coming.
00:47:34.769,00:47:38.230,It's all right.
00:47:38.230,00:47:40.899,It's okay.
00:47:40.899,00:47:42.276,"What was that about, hm?"
00:47:42.276,00:47:44.654,It was sinking.
00:47:44.654,00:47:47.198,Our house.
00:47:47.198,00:47:48.991,Oh.
00:47:50.409,00:47:52.829,It's okay now.
00:47:52.829,00:47:54.955,It's all right.
00:47:54.955,00:47:56.708,So what should we do?
00:47:56.708,00:48:02.463,Your mother used to sing to you when you had bad dreams.
00:48:02.463,00:48:06.300,"Bye Bye, Blackbird."
00:48:06.300,00:48:07.552,Yeah.
00:48:07.552,00:48:10.012,I miss her.
00:48:10.012,00:48:14.266,What do you think happens to someone after they die?
00:48:14.266,00:48:15.518,I don't know.
00:48:15.518,00:48:18.688,"Like, do you believe in heaven?"
00:48:21.691,00:48:24.360,I never did.
00:48:24.360,00:48:32.827,"Or the whole idea of an afterlife, but now I don't know, 'cause I have these dreams about her..."
00:48:32.827,00:48:35.371,about your mom...
00:48:36.622,00:48:40.710,and we have long talks...
00:48:40.710,00:48:44.422,"about you, how you're doing."
00:48:44.422,00:48:48.509,"She sort of knows, but I tell her anyway."
00:48:48.509,00:48:51.136,So what is that?
00:48:52.597,00:48:55.140,"It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?"
00:48:55.140,00:48:57.934,I'm starting to forget her.
00:49:00.937,00:49:04.191,"Oh, no."
00:49:14.368,00:49:23.252,"She could peel an apple in one long, curly strip."
00:49:25.254,00:49:27.339,The whole apple.
00:49:40.227,00:49:41.771,"I love you, Jonah."
00:49:41.771,00:49:44.607,"I love you, Dad."
00:49:51.113,00:49:54.283,See you tomorrow.
00:51:06.230,00:51:08.357,Laurie?
00:51:08.357,00:51:10.108,"Hi, it's Annie."
00:51:10.108,00:51:12.110,"Fine, fine, I'm fine."
00:51:12.110,00:51:15.990,"Listen, I'm doing an article on call-in radio shows."
00:51:15.990,00:51:19.785,Do you know anyone who works for someone named Dr. Marcia Fieldstone?
00:51:19.785,00:51:23.079,I'm a writer for The Baltimore Sun and a friend of Laurie Johnson.
00:51:23.079,00:51:25.750,I'm doing a piece on how people handle bereavement.
00:51:25.750,00:51:28.502,You had a caller the other night...
00:51:28.502,00:51:30.212,some guy from Seattle.
00:51:38.054,00:51:39.597,This is Jonah Baldwin.
00:51:39.597,00:51:42.224,"We're not in right now, but you can leave..."
00:51:42.224,00:51:43.642,Baldwin.
00:52:46.038,00:52:47.581,Architect.
00:53:20.156,00:53:21.740,Psst.
00:53:21.740,00:53:27.663,"Okay, Clarise, I'm going to be back either by midnight or 8:30 if disaster strikes."
00:53:27.663,00:53:29.874,Here's one for the both of us.
00:53:29.874,00:53:33.085,Sleepless and son.
00:53:33.085,00:53:36.005,I left the number of the restaurant I'll be at.
00:53:36.005,00:53:38.716,Here's a bottle of ipecac if anybody drinks poison.
00:53:38.716,00:53:41.093,It's right here next to the juice glasses.
00:53:41.093,00:53:42.427,Fine.
00:53:42.427,00:53:46.222,Great.
00:53:46.222,00:53:49.894,I look stupid. I look like I'm trying too hard.
00:53:49.894,00:53:52.646,I was going to get a haircut but then I'd just look like I got a haircut.
00:53:52.646,00:53:54.230,This is a good letter.
00:53:54.230,00:53:55.733,These shoes are grotesque.
00:53:55.733,00:53:57.651,I look like I'm trying to be tall.
00:53:57.651,00:54:00.404,Her name is Annie.
00:54:00.404,00:54:02.948,"Dad, read this!"
00:54:05.576,00:54:07.203,Dear Sleepless and son...
00:54:09.496,00:54:12.374,...an excellent third baseman for as long as anyone can remember.
00:54:12.374,00:54:17.129,And while we're on the subject Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever.
00:54:17.129,00:54:19.882,It's important that you agree on that because I'm from Baltimore.
00:54:19.882,00:54:22.176,She thinks he's the greatest.
00:54:22.176,00:54:23.928,Everyone thinks he is.
00:54:23.928,00:54:27.723,It's a sign.
00:54:27.723,00:54:29.265,I'll show you a sign.
00:54:29.265,00:54:30.475,Here is a sign.
00:54:30.475,00:54:34.188,"All right, where is Seattle?"
00:54:34.188,00:54:36.941,Right.
00:54:36.941,00:54:38.817,It's right there.
00:54:38.817,00:54:40.527,"Look, one, two, three..."
00:54:40.527,00:54:42.905,There's like 26 states between here and there.
00:54:42.905,00:54:45.365,Now that's a sign.
00:54:45.365,00:54:48.493,"Good-bye, good night."
00:54:52.248,00:54:54.332,"Clarise, did you move your car?"
00:54:54.332,00:54:55.667,Huh?
00:55:04.342,00:55:06.637,"Thank you, Derrick."
00:55:06.637,00:55:08.889,I'll have a...
00:55:08.889,00:55:10.224,Yes.
00:55:10.224,00:55:11.767,"I'm fine, thank you."
00:55:11.767,00:55:13.144,Hi.
00:55:13.144,00:55:17.815,You look good.
00:55:21.485,00:55:23.862,I thought you were never going to call me.
00:55:23.862,00:55:25.697,You did?
00:55:23.862,00:55:27.908,"I really wanted you to, and I thought you were never going to."
00:55:27.908,00:55:29.534,"Excuse me, Mr. Baldwin?"
00:55:29.534,00:55:32.496,Yes?
00:55:33.497,00:55:35.207,Excuse me.
00:55:38.585,00:55:40.545,Thank you. Hello?
00:55:40.545,00:55:44.883,"JONAH: Dad, can we go to New York City for Valentine's Day?"
00:55:44.883,00:55:48.262,What?
00:55:44.883,00:55:52.432,Annie Reed wants to meet us at the top of the Empire State Building on Valentine's Day.
00:55:52.432,00:55:54.893,Jonah?
00:55:54.893,00:55:57.437,Have you fallen?
00:55:57.437,00:55:58.563,Is Clarise there?
00:55:58.563,00:56:00.524,Has she been strangled?
00:56:00.524,00:56:02.400,This is the only reason for this call.
00:56:02.400,00:56:05.154,If we book now we can get an excursion fare.
00:56:05.154,00:56:08.073,Jessica's parents are travels agents and Jessica says...
00:56:08.073,00:56:10.284,I'm not going to have this conversation right now.
00:56:10.284,00:56:12.452,We'll talk later.
00:56:12.452,00:56:14.496,I can't believe this conversation has lasted this long.
00:56:14.496,00:56:16.081,You go to bed.
00:56:23.672,00:56:25.090,Everything all right?
00:56:25.090,00:56:26.175,"Oh, yeah."
00:56:26.175,00:56:27.968,Do you have kids?
00:56:27.968,00:56:29.385,You want mine?
00:56:31.930,00:56:34.641,"I will have an Absolut straight up, please."
00:56:34.641,00:56:35.893,Certainly.
00:56:52.492,00:56:56.454,"Hey, hey, hey, put that down. Stop it!"
00:56:56.454,00:56:57.873,There she is.
00:56:59.375,00:57:00.876,Why is she bringing groceries?
00:57:00.876,00:57:03.503,She's going to cook something for us so be prepared.
00:57:03.503,00:57:06.422,"Hi, Sam. Thanks."
00:57:06.422,00:57:09.385,And let me guess.
00:57:11.011,00:57:12.304,Hi.
00:57:13.429,00:57:14.848,"So, this it?"
00:57:14.848,00:57:18.310,The car's down this way.
00:57:18.310,00:57:22.480,She's on her sixth painter and we're never going to finish this job.
00:57:22.480,00:57:25.359,She wants the fireplace rebricked.
00:57:25.359,00:57:27.152,I know her pretty well.
00:57:27.152,00:57:30.197,"No, I'll just hit her with one of those bricks."
00:57:33.992,00:57:36.078,"Oh, that is so funny."
00:57:36.078,00:57:37.495,You are so funny.
00:57:37.495,00:57:41.458,"She goes through this song and dance, Oh, I don't know, I'm stupid."
00:57:41.458,00:57:48.924,"You know better, but couldn't we flip the house around so everything on one side is on the other and the back is in front?"
00:57:48.924,00:57:55.013,And could the front of the house open on one great big hinge.
00:57:55.013,00:57:57.599,"I said, Yeah, we can do that."
00:57:57.599,00:57:58.850,We're just going to have to...
00:57:58.850,00:58:00.727,Move the kitchen cabinets.
00:58:08.735,00:58:12.489,"Hey, Jonah, bring some of that stuff around, all right?"
00:58:12.489,00:58:15.700,Do you like baseball?
00:58:15.700,00:58:17.202,"Uh, yes, I do."
00:58:17.202,00:58:19.746,"In fact, my firm has box seats to the Mariners."
00:58:19.746,00:58:21.123,Why don't we all go sometime?
00:58:21.123,00:58:22.624,Hey!
00:58:22.624,00:58:24.251,What about camping?
00:58:24.251,00:58:25.585,What about it?
00:58:25.585,00:58:27.296,Do you like camping?
00:58:27.296,00:58:30.174,I went camping once.
00:58:30.174,00:58:32.884,You know what? We ought to start camping more often.
00:58:32.884,00:58:34.970,You're right.
00:58:34.970,00:58:36.430,Time for bed.
00:58:36.430,00:58:37.431,It's only 10:00.
00:58:37.431,00:58:40.851,"Yeah, 10:00."
00:58:40.851,00:58:42.727,Good-night.
00:58:45.730,00:58:51.028,"Well, hey. Don't you want to thank Victoria for this delicious dinner?"
00:58:51.028,00:58:55.240,I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
00:58:55.240,00:58:58.785,I'm glad you liked it.
00:59:02.289,00:59:05.125,"Yeah, we don't see a lot of potatoes around here."
00:59:05.125,00:59:06.460,We're rice men.
00:59:57.677,00:59:58.762,Ugh.
00:59:58.762,01:00:02.057,Oh...
01:00:02.057,01:00:03.808,"I'm sorry, Walter."
01:00:03.808,01:00:06.103,I'm sorry.
01:00:08.688,01:00:11.066,Hello.
01:00:11.066,01:00:13.110,What?
01:00:13.110,01:00:14.945,The kid is on.
01:00:14.945,01:00:16.029,Go. Turn it on.
01:00:16.029,01:00:18.240,Who is it?
01:00:18.240,01:00:19.908,It's Becky.
01:00:19.908,01:00:22.660,She's... She's having trouble with Rick again.
01:00:22.660,01:00:24.162,I'll go downstairs.
01:00:24.162,01:00:26.290,"Becky, I'll call you back."
01:00:27.916,01:00:29.751,"I'm sorry, Walter."
01:00:29.751,01:00:31.462,Are you bleeding?
01:00:31.462,01:00:34.047,I'm all right.
01:00:51.689,01:00:54.151,He's outside kissing her right this minute.
01:00:54.151,01:00:55.860,"Oh, really?"
01:00:55.860,01:00:57.529,"Jonah, tell the truth."
01:00:57.529,01:00:59.072,Are you spying on your father?
01:00:59.072,01:01:02.284,Who's he kissing right this minute?
01:01:02.284,01:01:04.161,JONAH: I have to make them stop.
01:01:04.161,01:01:07.831,How am I going to explain this to Walter?
01:01:07.831,01:01:11.502,JONAH: She brought two bags of groceries like she was staying here for a year.
01:01:11.502,01:01:14.045,FIELDSTONE: It's good that your father's dating.
01:01:14.045,01:01:15.672,It's just hard on you.
01:01:15.672,01:01:20.344,It's something that you think you want but then when it actually happens it scares you.
01:01:20.344,01:01:22.304,JONAH: That's not true.
01:01:22.304,01:01:27.351,FIELDSTONE: Shouldn't your father be the judge of whether someone is right or wrong for him?
01:01:27.351,01:01:29.561,JONAH: He's not sane enough to judge anything.
01:01:29.561,01:01:31.896,Now he's kissing her on the lips.
01:01:31.896,01:01:34.024,My dad's been captured by a ho.
01:01:34.024,01:01:35.484,What am I going to do?
01:01:35.484,01:01:37.819,"FIELDSTONE: Calm down, Jonah."
01:01:37.819,01:01:42.616,Tomorrow when you're sitting down to breakfast with your dad tell him how you feel.
01:01:42.616,01:01:46.453,It's not good to keep your feelings inside you.
01:01:50.624,01:01:55.462,"Miss Scarlet, in the broom closet with the radio."
01:01:55.462,01:01:57.255,Walter.
01:01:57.255,01:02:00.217,You scared me.
01:02:04.095,01:02:06.014,I thought I saw a black widow spider.
01:02:06.014,01:02:09.059,You scared us to death.
01:02:09.059,01:02:10.686,It was right over there.
01:02:10.686,01:02:20.571,"The next time you think you see a black widow spider say, Dad, excuse me, but I believe a poisonous insect is in the house."
01:02:20.571,01:02:22.280,"You scream like that again, I'll kill you."
01:02:22.280,01:02:27.118,Becky heard this guy on the radio she was sure was Rick.
01:02:24.074,01:02:31.081,She was completely hysterical and then it turned out the guy lived in Duluth.
01:02:31.081,01:02:32.874,Where is Duluth?
01:02:32.874,01:02:34.209,That doesn't make any sense.
01:02:34.209,01:02:35.752,"I know, Walter."
01:02:35.752,01:02:37.504,It doesn't make any sense at all.
01:02:37.504,01:02:40.257,Thank God my life is in place.
01:02:40.257,01:02:43.260,"Duluth. That's in, uh, North Dakota."
01:02:57.315,01:02:59.276,I love this letter.
01:02:59.276,01:03:01.361,You have to write to her.
01:03:01.361,01:03:02.820,You think so?
01:03:02.820,01:03:04.448,It's Y-O-H.
01:03:04.448,01:03:06.617,Yeah. What's that?
01:03:06.617,01:03:08.577,Your only hope.
01:03:20.213,01:03:25.009,I thought I would look into doing a story on those radio shows.
01:03:25.009,01:03:28.054,You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
01:03:28.054,01:03:29.723,Definitely.
01:03:48.992,01:03:50.952,Couldn't you do a phone interview?
01:03:50.952,01:03:53.413,Not for the kind of piece I want to do.
01:03:53.413,01:03:55.707,I won't be in Chicago that long.
01:03:55.707,01:03:57.917,"When you get back, I'll be gone."
01:03:57.917,01:04:00.337,And then I'll see you in New York.
01:04:00.337,01:04:02.506,I'll get it. I'll...
01:04:05.883,01:04:11.640,"This is Captain Browning, and we're at our cruising altitude of 35,000 feet."
01:04:11.640,01:04:17.187,The weather looks clear to the west and we expect to arrive in Seattle on schedule.
01:04:17.187,01:04:19.063,Don't you hate flying?
01:04:19.063,01:04:25.403,"Yes, I do, and I just told the most terrible one to the man I'm about to marry."
01:04:25.403,01:04:28.906,Do you feel that any lie is a betrayal?
01:04:28.906,01:04:31.075,I said flying.
01:04:31.075,01:04:34.120,Oh... Oh.
01:04:38.875,01:04:40.627,Thanks for bringing me out here.
01:04:40.627,01:04:43.129,"Oh, well, he likes the planes."
01:04:43.129,01:04:46.049,Can I bring something back for you? Souvenir?
01:04:46.049,01:04:47.801,Does he like those little snow globes?
01:04:47.801,01:04:50.428,You shake them up and then the snow floats down.
01:04:50.428,01:04:52.305,Sure. I'd really like that.
01:04:52.305,01:04:54.391,Thank you so much.
01:04:58.186,01:05:00.689,He's eight.
01:05:00.689,01:05:02.232,I read an article about this.
01:05:02.232,01:05:05.402,All children are hideous at the age of eight.
01:05:05.402,01:05:11.324,"Well, maybe when I come back the two of us ought to spend some time together on our own."
01:05:11.324,01:05:13.827,What do you think?
01:05:16.954,01:05:18.665,Bye.
01:05:18.665,01:05:20.083,"Bye, Jonah."
01:05:20.083,01:05:21.585,Bye.
01:05:25.547,01:05:30.093,Jonah...
01:05:30.093,01:05:31.678,You don't know Victoria.
01:05:31.678,01:05:33.346,I hardly know her myself.
01:05:33.346,01:05:36.433,"She is, in fact, a mystery to me."
01:05:36.433,01:05:39.686,She tosses her hair.
01:05:39.686,01:05:41.020,I have no idea.
01:05:41.020,01:05:42.939,Is it a twitch?
01:05:42.939,01:05:47.778,Should she use a barrette to keep her hair out of her face?
01:05:47.778,01:05:55.619,These are things I'm willing to get to the bottom of and that is why I am dating her.
01:05:55.619,01:05:57.829,That's all I'm doing.
01:05:57.829,01:06:00.791,I'm not living with her.
01:06:00.791,01:06:04.544,Can you appreciate the difference?
01:06:04.544,01:06:06.212,This is what single people do.
01:06:06.212,01:06:08.799,They try other people on and see how they fit.
01:06:08.799,01:06:11.968,But everybody's an adjustment.
01:06:11.968,01:06:15.931,There's no such thing as a perfect...
01:06:30.987,01:06:33.364,Come on.
01:06:35.366,01:06:38.912,"Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation."
01:06:38.912,01:06:41.122,She says you knew Annie in another life.
01:06:41.122,01:06:43.750,Who's Annie?
01:06:43.750,01:06:52.342,"But Jessica says you and Annie never got together in that life so your hearts are like puzzles with missing pieces and when you get together, the puzzle's complete."
01:06:52.342,01:06:53.802,Goddamn it.
01:06:53.802,01:07:00.057,The reason I know this and you don't is because I'm younger and pure so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
01:07:00.057,01:07:02.853,Who told you this stuff?
01:07:02.853,01:07:06.105,I sincerely hope you're not marrying Jessica.
01:09:49.393,01:09:52.147,ANNIE: I watched him play with his son at the beach.
01:09:52.147,01:09:53.648,BECKY: Did you talk to him?
01:09:53.648,01:09:56.567,I couldn't do it.
01:09:58.277,01:09:59.863,How did I get here?
01:09:59.863,01:10:02.281,BECKY: You told a lie and got on a plane.
01:10:02.281,01:10:05.201,That's not what I mean.
01:10:05.201,01:10:09.413,I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him. I am.
01:10:09.413,01:10:10.581,Okay.
01:10:10.581,01:10:12.500,Good. Good-bye.
01:10:12.500,01:10:15.170,Beck...
01:10:16.838,01:10:18.422,Is this crazy?
01:10:18.422,01:10:22.635,No. That's the weirdest part about it.
01:10:22.635,01:10:24.762,Thank you.
01:10:24.762,01:10:27.015,I love you.
01:10:27.015,01:10:28.892,Good night.
01:11:31.037,01:11:33.748,"Oh, it's so good to see you."
01:11:33.748,01:11:35.833,Where's Greg?
01:11:58.355,01:11:59.732,Hello.
01:12:01.358,01:12:03.319,Hello.
01:12:08.783,01:12:10.910,BECKY: So then what happened?
01:12:10.910,01:12:13.163,"ANNIE: So then I left, obviously."
01:12:13.163,01:12:15.623,You were in the middle of the street?
01:12:15.623,01:12:19.669,You know that dream when you're walking the street naked?
01:12:19.669,01:12:21.378,I love that dream.
01:12:21.378,01:12:25.258,"That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing."
01:12:25.258,01:12:26.759,But he saw you?
01:12:26.759,01:12:29.762,ANNIE: He saw me.
01:12:29.762,01:12:32.431,He said hello.
01:12:32.431,01:12:35.018,All I could say was hello.
01:12:35.018,01:12:37.312,"Oh, my God."
01:12:37.312,01:12:41.274,And all I could say was...
01:12:41.274,01:12:43.400,It's a sign.
01:12:43.400,01:12:47.571,It's a sign I have watched this movie too many times.
01:12:47.571,01:12:50.200,"Oh, Annie."
01:12:50.200,01:12:55.330,From the minute I listened to that stupid program I've been a complete jerk.
01:12:55.330,01:12:56.831,You are not a jerk.
01:12:56.831,01:12:59.209,Thank you. Idiot.
01:12:59.209,01:13:01.585,"You don't know who she was, Annie."
01:13:01.585,01:13:05.298,I saw her.
01:13:05.298,01:13:08.301,That detective in Seattle sent me a picture of her.
01:13:08.301,01:13:10.345,"Here. See, huh?"
01:13:10.345,01:13:12.513,That's exactly what she looks like.
01:13:12.513,01:13:14.932,This is a picture of someone's back.
01:13:14.932,01:13:18.353,"Well, it's her, and he was crazy about her."
01:13:18.353,01:13:20.146,What's this?
01:13:20.146,01:13:22.439,This is from Seattle.
01:13:29.989,01:13:31.699,Becky...
01:13:33.701,01:13:36.120,So I mailed your letter.
01:13:37.872,01:13:41.209,"Dear Annie, Thanks for your letter."
01:13:41.209,01:13:44.337,It was great.
01:13:47.215,01:13:56.933,We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are...
01:13:56.933,01:13:58.393,See ya soon.
01:13:58.393,01:14:01.854,Sleepless in Seattle.
01:14:01.854,01:14:03.314,M.F.E.O.?
01:14:07.402,01:14:10.487,Made for each other.
01:14:10.487,01:14:12.865,It's cute.
01:14:12.865,01:14:14.742,It's like a little clue.
01:14:17.703,01:14:19.205,Ah!
01:14:19.205,01:14:21.249,"So, he can't write."
01:14:21.249,01:14:22.541,Big deal.
01:14:22.541,01:14:28.423,Verbal ability is highly overrated in a guy and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into trouble.
01:14:28.423,01:14:32.218,I am going to run back to Walter's arms if he'll have me.
01:14:32.218,01:14:33.803,What about the letter?
01:14:33.803,01:14:37.598,"It was written before I went out there, before the ho."
01:14:41.102,01:14:44.439,"The only thing is, she didn't look like a ho."
01:14:44.439,01:14:49.902,She looked like somebody we would have been friends with.
01:14:51.362,01:14:54.282,You saw her in the airport and then here?
01:14:54.282,01:14:57.534,SAM: I tried to talk to her.
01:14:57.534,01:14:59.120,Like a déjà vu thing?
01:14:59.120,01:15:02.081,A very French déjà vu-ish kind of thing.
01:15:02.081,01:15:03.666,Oui.
01:15:03.666,01:15:07.003,At least you're out there seeing people.
01:15:07.003,01:15:09.130,There's really just the one.
01:15:09.130,01:15:11.882,Victoria.
01:15:11.882,01:15:13.301,You don't like Victoria?
01:15:13.301,01:15:14.927,She laughs like a hyena.
01:15:14.927,01:15:18.555,Is this true?
01:15:18.555,01:15:22.101,"Sort of. Hey, tell them what you did."
01:15:22.101,01:15:23.560,Dad...
01:15:23.560,01:15:25.355,About the radio show.
01:15:25.355,01:15:27.148,Tell them.
01:15:27.148,01:15:33.696,"Christmas Eve, he phones in one of those radio call-in shows and tells them I need a new wife."
01:15:33.696,01:15:37.367,"Oh, you're kidding."
01:15:37.367,01:15:40.203,Now he's obsessed with this woman who wrote me.
01:15:40.203,01:15:41.912,Are you serious?
01:15:41.912,01:15:44.748,She wants to meet me at the top of the Empire State Building.
01:15:44.748,01:15:47.377,On Valentine's Day.
01:15:47.377,01:15:49.962,It's like that movie.
01:15:49.962,01:15:53.090,An Affair to Remember.
01:15:53.090,01:15:54.967,"Oh, God."
01:15:54.967,01:15:57.345,Cary Grant and Deborah Karr.
01:15:57.345,01:15:58.388,Is it Karr or Kerr?
01:15:58.388,01:16:00.597,Kerr.
01:16:00.597,01:16:04.435,"Okay, she's going to meet him at the top of the Empire State Building."
01:16:04.435,01:16:13.610,"Only she got hit by a taxi and he waited and waited and it was raining, I think, and then..."
01:16:13.610,01:16:18.533,"she's too proud to tell him that she's, uh..."
01:16:21.160,01:16:23.204,crippled...
01:16:23.204,01:16:29.293,"and he's too proud to find out why she doesn't come, but he comes to see her anyway."
01:16:29.293,01:16:31.628,"I forget why, but, oh..."
01:16:31.628,01:16:40.471,"Oh, it's so amazing when he comes to see her, because he doesn't even notice she doesn't get up to say hello."
01:16:40.471,01:16:50.231,"And he's very bitter, and you think that he's just going to walk out the door and never know why."
01:16:50.231,01:16:59.740,"She's just lying there, you know, like on the couch with this blanket over her shriveled little legs and..."
01:16:59.740,01:17:03.244,Are you all right?
01:17:03.244,01:17:05.204,SUZY: And he goes...
01:17:05.204,01:17:06.539,I saw the painting.
01:17:06.539,01:17:17.800,"And he, like, goes to the bedroom and he looks, and he comes out, and he looks at her and he kind of just, they know, and then they hug and it's so..."
01:17:17.800,01:17:19.927,That's a chick's movie.
01:17:19.927,01:17:22.096,I would say so.
01:17:22.096,01:17:25.641,What kind of a person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
01:17:25.641,01:17:28.478,I got hundreds of letters from all over.
01:17:28.478,01:17:29.728,Desperate women.
01:17:29.728,01:17:33.649,"Because someone is looking for a guy, they're not desperate."
01:17:33.649,01:17:35.692,How about rapacious and love-starved?
01:17:35.692,01:17:39.780,It is easier to be killed by a terrorist than find a husband after 40.
01:17:39.780,01:17:41.198,Absolutely untrue!
01:17:41.198,01:17:43.659,Right. Right.
01:17:43.659,01:17:45.786,I'm not looking for a mail-order bride.
01:17:45.786,01:17:54.128,I just want somebody that I can have a decent conversation without it falling down into weepy tears over some movie you just saw.
01:17:54.128,01:17:55.463,She's very emotional.
01:17:55.463,01:17:57.590,I cried at the end of The Dirty Dozen.
01:17:57.590,01:18:07.308,Jim Brown was throwing these hand grenades and Richard Jaeckel and Lee Marvin were sitting on this armored personnel carrier dressed like Nazis...
01:18:08.767,01:18:11.562,Trini Lopez...
01:18:11.562,01:18:15.065,He busted his neck when they were parachuting behind Nazi lines.
01:18:15.065,01:18:16.442,Stop it.
01:18:16.442,01:18:22.323,Richard Jaeckel had on this shiny helmet 'cause he was the M.P.
01:18:22.323,01:18:25.493,"Oh... oh, God, I love that movie."
01:18:33.750,01:18:37.087,This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
01:18:37.087,01:18:38.714,What's so great about it?
01:18:38.714,01:18:41.133,You have to find her.
01:18:41.133,01:18:43.844,Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
01:18:43.844,01:18:45.471,Nobody knows.
01:18:45.471,01:18:48.599,It changes practically every day.
01:18:48.599,01:18:51.477,How much money do you have?
01:18:51.477,01:18:55.064,I have 42.
01:18:55.064,01:18:57.233,But how would I get there?
01:18:57.233,01:18:59.985,"WOMAN: Honey, I have to run these tickets over."
01:18:59.985,01:19:02.154,Keep an eye on things.
01:19:02.154,01:19:03.698,"Sure, Mom."
01:19:14.333,01:19:16.043,Window seat or an aisle?
01:19:16.043,01:19:17.503,Window.
01:19:17.503,01:19:20.130,Want a fruit plate?
01:19:20.130,01:19:22.717,I'd rather die than eat airplane food.
01:19:22.717,01:19:27.388,I'm telling them you're 12 so you can fly unaccompanied.
01:19:27.388,01:19:30.099,Are you crazy?
01:19:30.099,01:19:33.018,"If it's in the computer, they believe anything."
01:19:33.018,01:19:34.729,Are you sure?
01:19:34.729,01:19:39.900,Do you want me to say that you're short for your age and they shouldn't say anything?
01:19:39.900,01:19:42.069,Yeah. That's a great idea.
01:19:59.420,01:20:02.089,Walter.
01:20:02.089,01:20:03.966,You're going to miss the train.
01:20:03.966,01:20:06.135,"No, I'm not."
01:20:06.135,01:20:07.928,"I'm so happy, Becky."
01:20:07.928,01:20:09.805,Finally I feel happy.
01:20:09.805,01:20:11.641,This is right.
01:20:11.641,01:20:14.477,Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies.
01:20:14.477,01:20:17.104,And you completely lose sight of what counts.
01:20:17.104,01:20:26.238,"Please, don't tell anybody what happened because I would be mortified if anyone knew."
01:20:26.238,01:20:28.699,Do you promise?
01:20:28.699,01:20:30.701,Sleepless in Seattle is history.
01:21:01.732,01:21:04.318,I was just...
01:21:04.318,01:21:06.612,Go ahead.
01:21:06.612,01:21:23.003,"Okay. Well, I was just going to say that ever since Christmas you've been different, kind of distracted, distant, but now it feels as if you're coming back from wherever you were."
01:21:23.003,01:21:24.547,I am.
01:21:26.298,01:21:29.051,"I was just, uh..."
01:21:29.051,01:21:33.305,I just... I just got...
01:21:33.305,01:21:35.432,"But that's normal, right?"
01:21:35.432,01:21:39.311,"I mean, don't you ever feel nervous about..."
01:21:39.311,01:21:41.480,You know?
01:21:41.480,01:21:43.774,What?
01:21:43.774,01:21:45.150,Forever.
01:21:46.985,01:21:48.987,No.
01:21:51.948,01:21:53.826,Well...
01:21:53.826,01:21:57.788,"I did, and you know what I think?"
01:21:57.788,01:22:02.418,"I think I thought it was too perfect, you know?"
01:22:02.418,01:22:08.215,I started to wonder if we were the human equivalent of two rights making a wrong.
01:22:08.215,01:22:09.966,You know what it was?
01:22:09.966,01:22:14.971,"It was like kismet, but not, if you see what I mean."
01:22:14.971,01:22:16.640,You have to grow up.
01:22:16.640,01:22:22.104,You can't keep having these adolescent fantasies about how exciting your life is going to be.
01:22:22.104,01:22:24.774,"Don't hate me, but I love this pattern."
01:22:24.774,01:22:26.901,You couldn't.
01:22:26.901,01:22:29.779,This is just like my grandmother's china.
01:22:29.779,01:22:32.072,How many place settings?
01:22:32.072,01:22:34.199,Ten.
01:22:36.744,01:22:37.828,Exactly.
01:22:37.828,01:22:41.290,Eight is too few.
01:22:41.290,01:22:43.542,Too many.
01:23:05.981,01:23:07.691,Walter!
01:23:07.691,01:23:09.944,It was my mother's.
01:23:11.904,01:23:14.323,I had them size it down.
01:23:15.282,01:23:17.743,She had really fat fingers.
01:23:19.829,01:23:21.580,It's so beautiful.
01:23:21.580,01:23:28.211,It's exactly what I would pick out if I had every ring in the whole world to choose from.
01:23:30.506,01:23:32.007,You see what I mean?
01:23:32.007,01:23:37.972,"There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of those people."
01:23:37.972,01:23:40.265,"No, sirree."
01:23:40.265,01:23:43.185,Surprises are highly overrated.
01:23:46.146,01:23:49.191,"I'm leaving in the morning, but I'll only be gone one night."
01:23:49.191,01:23:54.905,"And Clarise will be here, so you can see Geraldo and Nightmare on Elm Street 12."
01:23:54.905,01:23:57.950,Are you going with her?
01:23:57.950,01:24:00.369,"I'm going with Victoria, yes."
01:24:02.204,01:24:05.123,"And don't try anything tricky, understand?"
01:24:08.043,01:24:14.925,Don't go rolling in poison ivy as soon as I leave the house or do anything that makes you need stitches.
01:24:14.925,01:24:16.927,If your finger falls off it's staying off.
01:24:16.927,01:24:22.558,No one will take you to the hospital for laser surgery.
01:24:22.558,01:24:24.643,Is this about that woman in Baltimore?
01:24:24.643,01:24:26.102,Annie.
01:24:30.148,01:24:32.943,I don't care what you do!
01:24:32.943,01:24:36.196,I'll tell you what I'm doing this weekend.
01:24:36.196,01:24:38.198,1990s and nobody's getting laid.
01:24:38.198,01:24:41.201,I'm the only man in America getting laid this weekend.
01:24:41.201,01:24:42.745,I haven't been laid that much.
01:24:42.745,01:24:46.540,"Six girls in college, maybe seven."
01:24:46.540,01:24:48.291,How long have you been standing there?
01:24:48.291,01:24:49.668,Forever.
01:24:49.668,01:24:51.045,What did I say?
01:24:51.045,01:24:53.547,"Six girls in college, maybe seven."
01:24:53.547,01:24:56.299,Seven.
01:24:56.299,01:24:58.093,This one is the one I like.
01:25:00.804,01:25:06.226,"Jonah, the fact is, you're not going to like any woman because it isn't your mother."
01:25:06.226,01:25:07.937,How do you know?
01:25:07.937,01:25:09.271,What's wrong with Annie?
01:25:09.271,01:25:11.481,"Oh, Jonah, shut up!"
01:25:11.481,01:25:14.068,Shut up? Shut up?
01:25:14.068,01:25:16.070,Mom never said shut up to me!
01:25:16.070,01:25:17.487,Mom never yelled at me!
01:25:17.487,01:25:19.031,The conversation is finished.
01:25:19.031,01:25:20.950,Why can't we go to New York?
01:25:20.950,01:25:25.913,We are not going on a plane to meet some woman who could be a crazy lunatic.
01:25:25.913,01:25:27.581,Didn't you see Fatal Attraction?
01:25:27.581,01:25:30.125,You wouldn't let me!
01:25:30.125,01:25:34.504,And it scared every man in America.
01:25:34.504,01:25:38.050,I'm not leaving till you say yes.
01:25:43.639,01:25:45.181,I hate you!
01:25:45.181,01:25:46.642,That's good!
01:25:46.642,01:25:54.316,You can tell Oprah how your dad destroyed your life because he had a weekend special at the Holiday Inn.
01:26:08.705,01:26:12.793,"Jonah, Clarise is here and I got to go."
01:26:14.044,01:26:16.046,"Hey, Jonah."
01:26:18.381,01:26:19.842,Jonah?
01:26:22.719,01:26:24.471,"All right, Jonah."
01:26:24.471,01:26:28.266,"Listen, I got to go, and I'm..."
01:26:29.935,01:26:31.353,Jonah?
01:26:31.353,01:26:32.896,Jonah?
01:26:35.107,01:26:36.566,"Hey, Jonah?"
01:26:39.987,01:26:41.279,Jonah?
01:26:43.448,01:26:45.868,Jonah!
01:26:47.119,01:26:49.163,Jonah!
01:26:55.836,01:26:58.547,"Jessica, honey, you have to tell us where he is."
01:26:58.547,01:27:01.466,Jonah's daddy is very upset.
01:27:01.466,01:27:03.635,"Jessica, this is your father."
01:27:03.635,01:27:05.679,Tell us where he is right this minute.
01:27:08.932,01:27:10.600,N.Y.
01:27:10.600,01:27:12.519,What is that?
01:27:12.519,01:27:15.355,That's N.W.
01:27:15.355,01:27:19.568,New York. He's on his way to New York.
01:27:19.568,01:27:21.195,What?
01:27:21.195,01:27:23.072,United 597.
01:27:23.072,01:27:24.447,JESSICA'S MOTHER: Jessica...
01:27:24.447,01:27:26.825,When does it leave?
01:27:33.582,01:27:35.125,Here you go.
01:27:35.125,01:27:36.960,Here's a nice pen for you for flying with us.
01:27:36.960,01:27:38.545,Thank you.
01:27:38.545,01:27:39.671,Can I take this for you?
01:27:39.671,01:27:41.006,No.
01:27:56.813,01:27:58.815,"Where to, kid?"
01:27:58.815,01:28:00.483,Hold on.
01:28:00.483,01:28:01.944,Empire State Building.
01:28:01.944,01:28:04.404,"Get further away from the curb next time, mac."
01:28:07.116,01:28:08.658,DRIVER: There it is.
01:28:08.658,01:28:11.245,What you going to do up there?
01:28:11.245,01:28:12.370,Spit off the top?
01:28:12.370,01:28:13.580,No.
01:28:13.580,01:28:16.374,I'm going to meet my new mother.
01:28:35.727,01:28:37.771,Excuse me.
01:28:37.771,01:28:38.981,Are you Annie?
01:28:38.981,01:28:40.690,"No, I'm Cynthia."
01:28:48.406,01:28:49.616,Excuse me.
01:28:49.616,01:28:51.576,Are you Annie?
01:29:28.697,01:29:31.908,Mm... great table.
01:29:33.702,01:29:36.496,Something wrong?
01:29:36.496,01:29:38.165,Can I get you a drink?
01:29:38.165,01:29:39.499,Some champagne?
01:29:40.917,01:29:43.419,Fine. Fine.
01:29:43.419,01:29:48.050,Can we have a bottle of Dom Deluise?
01:29:50.302,01:29:52.095,Just kidding.
01:29:52.095,01:29:53.722,He meant Dom Perignon.
01:29:53.722,01:29:55.265,I got it.
01:29:57.184,01:29:58.310,Whoo.
01:29:58.310,01:30:00.520,"Beautiful view, isn't it?"
01:30:00.520,01:30:02.314,Walter...
01:30:03.690,01:30:05.734,There's something I have to tell you.
01:30:19.831,01:30:22.667,"Hey, I'm sorry."
01:30:22.667,01:30:24.502,"Money! Money, all right?"
01:30:24.502,01:30:26.046,"Money, money, see?"
01:30:26.046,01:30:28.215,Thank you!
01:30:30.217,01:30:31.593,Come on.
01:31:43.206,01:31:47.461,"So, he could be on top of the Empire State Building now."
01:31:47.461,01:31:49.712,No.
01:31:49.712,01:31:54.550,"I guess he could be, but no."
01:31:54.550,01:31:57.346,"It's not him, Walter."
01:31:58.554,01:32:00.807,I can't do this.
01:32:02.142,01:32:04.894,"Look, Annie..."
01:32:04.894,01:32:09.858,"I love you, but let's leave that out of this."
01:32:09.858,01:32:12.610,I don't want to be someone that you're settling for.
01:32:12.610,01:32:17.032,I don't want to be someone that anyone settles for.
01:32:18.574,01:32:24.289,Marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it.
01:32:24.289,01:32:25.915,Isn't it?
01:32:25.915,01:32:29.169,"Walter, I don't deserve you."
01:32:29.169,01:32:32.381,"Naw, I wouldn't put it that way."
01:32:33.798,01:32:36.468,But... okay.
01:32:51.774,01:32:53.860,You okay?
01:32:53.860,01:32:55.862,Yeah.
01:33:01.201,01:33:02.536,What?
01:33:02.536,01:33:03.995,Look.
01:33:12.462,01:33:13.880,It's a sign.
01:33:13.880,01:33:15.715,Who needed a sign?
01:33:15.715,01:33:17.426,Walter...
01:33:19.052,01:33:20.803,I have to go.
01:33:33.607,01:33:36.861,Jonah!
01:33:36.861,01:33:39.155,Jonah?
01:33:39.155,01:33:41.615,Dad! Dad!
01:33:45.579,01:33:46.913,Oh...
01:33:55.422,01:33:58.174,What if something had happened to you?
01:33:58.174,01:34:00.051,What if I couldn't get to you?
01:34:00.051,01:34:02.971,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
01:34:04.347,01:34:07.142,"Oh, what would I have done? Huh?"
01:34:07.142,01:34:10.562,You are my family.
01:34:10.562,01:34:12.981,I thought she'd be here.
01:34:12.981,01:34:15.150,Aren't we okay?
01:34:15.150,01:34:17.860,Have I done anything really stupid?
01:34:17.860,01:34:19.237,No.
01:34:19.237,01:34:20.822,Have I screwed it up for the both of us?
01:34:20.822,01:34:22.698,No.
01:35:14.750,01:35:16.085,Observation deck?
01:35:16.085,01:35:19.422,"Sorry, ma'am, but it's too late."
01:35:19.422,01:35:21.715,"No. Please, I really need to get up there."
01:35:21.715,01:35:24.052,We're closing up.
01:35:29.765,01:35:34.312,"Listen, can I just take a look?"
01:35:34.312,01:35:35.897,There's someone I was supposed to meet.
01:35:35.897,01:35:41.194,"He's probably not there, but if I don't look I'll always wonder about it."
01:35:41.194,01:35:42.987,"Cary Grant, right?"
01:35:42.987,01:35:45.407,You know that movie?
01:35:45.407,01:35:47.409,One of my wife's favorites.
01:35:56.292,01:35:59.588,"Hey, maybe when we get home we'll get a dog."
01:35:59.588,01:36:01.005,Okay.
01:36:01.005,01:36:02.924,"What do you mean, Okay?"
01:36:02.924,01:36:05.093,Wouldn't you like to have a dog?
01:36:05.093,01:36:06.720,Sure.
01:36:18.940,01:36:21.943,"I'm sorry, ma'am. Empty."
01:36:24.571,01:36:27.073,Can I take a minute?
01:36:27.073,01:36:29.451,Go ahead.
01:37:42.148,01:37:45.193,I left it by the telescopes...
01:38:11.344,01:38:12.595,It's you.
01:38:12.595,01:38:13.805,It's me.
01:38:13.805,01:38:16.808,I saw you...
01:38:16.808,01:38:18.100,Are you Annie?
01:38:20.228,01:38:21.937,Yes.
01:38:24.273,01:38:26.609,You're Annie?
01:38:28.944,01:38:30.864,This must be yours.
01:38:30.864,01:38:33.074,I'm Jonah.
01:38:33.074,01:38:34.534,This is my dad.
01:38:34.534,01:38:36.661,His name's Sam.
01:38:39.205,01:38:40.874,Sam.
01:38:45.169,01:38:47.630,And who's this?
01:38:47.630,01:38:50.091,"Oh, Howard."
01:39:05.815,01:39:07.233,We'd better go.
01:39:14.616,01:39:15.949,Shall we?
01:40:02.872,01:40:04.290,Sam.
01:40:05.541,01:40:06.793,It's nice to meet you.
