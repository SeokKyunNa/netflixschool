00:02:53.256,00:02:54.924,"-Hey, Jimmy. -Leg seems better."
00:03:01.556,00:03:04.809,"Thinking I'd take him out, check the fence line after breakfast."
00:03:20.033,00:03:22.035,Yeah. You want to come dance with me?
00:03:26.122,00:03:27.498,Yeah. Yeah.
00:03:27.582,00:03:29.918,"Yeah, you like that so much, don't you?"
00:03:34.047,00:03:36.132,There's Grandma and Grandpa.
00:03:38.760,00:03:40.261,Got your nose.
00:03:49.187,00:03:50.730,Oh.
00:03:51.731,00:03:52.941,Lorna.
00:03:53.316,00:03:54.609,"Honey, it's too hot."
00:03:55.902,00:03:57.695,I know. I hadn't checked it yet.
00:03:57.779,00:04:01.407,"Here. Let… Oh, that's all right."
00:04:01.741,00:04:03.076,That's all right.
00:04:05.036,00:04:06.412,You rest.
00:04:11.751,00:04:13.002,Ah.
00:04:13.753,00:04:15.088,I see you.
00:04:15.171,00:04:16.756,I see you.
00:04:16.839,00:04:18.508,I see you.
00:04:18.591,00:04:20.176,"Hi, handsome."
00:04:26.933,00:04:28.559,Oh.
00:04:44.534,00:04:45.535,James.
00:04:58.965,00:05:00.091,George!
00:05:19.360,00:05:20.778,Where's George going?
00:05:22.155,00:05:23.614,Where's James?
00:05:33.207,00:05:34.500,James!
00:05:44.552,00:05:45.928,James!
00:05:54.645,00:05:56.064,"Oh, no."
00:06:00.193,00:06:01.778,"Oh, my God."
00:07:41.919,00:07:54.056,"I, Lorna Blackledge… take you, Donnie… take you, Donald Weboy, to be my lawfully wedded husband."
00:07:55.183,00:07:59.270,"To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse."
00:07:59.353,00:08:04.150,"To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse."
00:08:04.609,00:08:08.529,"For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health."
00:08:09.238,00:08:12.867,"For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health."
00:08:13.075,00:08:15.203,Until death do us part.
00:08:16.245,00:08:18.331,Until death do us part.
00:08:19.540,00:08:26.255,"By the power vested in me by the state of Montana, I now pronounce you man and wife."
00:08:26.339,00:08:27.924,You may kiss the bride.
00:08:28.466,00:08:29.967,"Thank you, sir."
00:08:30.551,00:08:32.178,Think I will.
00:08:41.604,00:08:44.232,"-Congratulations, Donald. -Thank you, sir."
00:08:46.442,00:08:47.777,You want some cake?
00:08:48.361,00:08:49.779,Mama B.
00:09:30.611,00:09:34.615,"So, uh, kitchen."
00:09:43.082,00:09:45.293,"We've, uh-- We got more stuff coming."
00:09:45.376,00:09:47.420,I put some chairs on layaway.
00:09:49.130,00:09:50.840,Here you go.
00:09:53.050,00:09:54.343,Do you like it?
00:09:54.427,00:09:55.761,-Do you like your bed? -Yeah.
00:09:55.845,00:09:57.805,-Do you like your bed? -Yeah.
00:09:59.181,00:10:00.558,I'll sew you some curtains.
00:10:01.225,00:10:02.268,Okay.
00:11:08.876,00:11:10.086,He isn't far.
00:11:11.462,00:11:12.588,Just in town.
00:11:16.759,00:11:18.010,He isn't here.
00:12:07.643,00:12:09.687,"You dropped it all, buddy."
00:12:09.770,00:12:11.355,"Come on, let's go."
00:12:11.439,00:12:13.357,"Hey. Come on, let's go."
00:12:45.181,00:12:46.640,Let's go!
00:13:15.920,00:13:17.254,It's not for you.
00:13:22.927,00:13:24.178,Lorna?
00:13:25.596,00:13:26.722,Hello?
00:13:31.519,00:13:33.312,You're the girl's mother?
00:13:33.395,00:13:38.776,No. I'm… Lorna was married to my son.
00:13:39.693,00:13:41.195,The little boy is my grandson.
00:13:41.487,00:13:42.780,"Well, you missed 'em."
00:13:43.197,00:13:44.406,Gone now.
00:13:45.491,00:13:46.534,Gone?
00:13:47.117,00:13:48.827,Gone to his family.
00:13:49.286,00:13:50.996,Took off last night.
00:13:52.498,00:13:53.832,"Wait, wait, wait. Wait."
00:13:53.916,00:13:56.377,His family? Donnie's?
00:13:59.213,00:14:01.006,They mention when they'd be back?
00:14:01.340,00:14:03.259,Not no time soon be my guess.
00:14:03.842,00:14:05.219,Took all they had.
00:16:14.598,00:16:16.433,Headed any place in particular?
00:16:17.810,00:16:18.936,"Sit down, George."
00:16:26.110,00:16:27.569,I'm going to get Jimmy.
00:16:28.404,00:16:29.989,Bring him home to live with us.
00:16:31.782,00:16:34.159,"Well, you sure packed for a trip into town."
00:16:37.538,00:16:38.831,"Sit down, George."
00:16:55.347,00:16:59.351,You didn't see fit to share this with me?
00:17:04.523,00:17:05.899,Sharing it now.
00:17:12.698,00:17:14.158,Anyone else see it happen?
00:17:19.163,00:17:21.790,I'm asking if you're sure what you saw.
00:17:22.875,00:17:26.754,I saw exactly what I've always felt about Donnie Weboy.
00:17:29.423,00:17:31.550,whether anyone'll ever get you to admit it or not.
00:17:31.633,00:17:34.219,And I saw that girl can't protect her child.
00:17:34.303,00:17:38.140,"And on that account, you expect she's, what, just gonna hand him over to you?"
00:17:38.223,00:17:39.683,That what you see happening?
00:17:44.396,00:17:46.273,And when Lorna says no?
00:17:48.442,00:17:49.902,"Margaret, Jimmy's her boy."
00:17:49.985,00:17:53.405,"He's your grandson, George Blackledge."
00:18:07.711,00:18:10.547,And your plan for finding 'em?
00:18:11.757,00:18:14.468,Donnie's from somewhere in North Dakota. I'll find 'em.
00:18:15.260,00:18:17.471,You ought to know me well enough by now.
00:18:19.890,00:18:20.974,I do.
00:18:22.267,00:18:24.228,I won't be coming back here without him.
00:18:24.686,00:18:25.771,Nope.
00:18:26.855,00:18:30.442,And you're going with me or without me?
00:18:34.238,00:18:35.447,That's your choice.
00:18:52.381,00:18:53.757,You're not coming?
00:18:53.841,00:18:57.761,I'm turning off the water. Don't want to come home to busted pipes.
00:19:55.027,00:19:58.197,-You don't know when you'll be back. -I don't need reminding.
00:19:58.280,00:19:59.573,I know what I've lost.
00:20:02.034,00:20:04.286,"Sometimes that's all life is, Margaret."
00:20:04.953,00:20:07.039,The list of what we've lost.
00:21:30.956,00:21:33.041,"Oh, so I do get a piece."
00:22:17.961,00:22:22.341,"Sheriff Hayden's been out of office, oh… seven years now."
00:22:23.342,00:22:25.594,Good man. Beat me to it.
00:22:26.636,00:22:35.020,He helped me track down a couple of men I was looking for back in… Pettus brothers.
00:22:35.103,00:22:37.647,I remember that. That was you?
00:22:38.815,00:22:40.025,"Well, you sure got 'em."
00:22:40.108,00:22:41.902,"Yeah, I had some help."
00:22:41.985,00:22:43.528,"Well, how can I help?"
00:22:44.446,00:22:46.656,We're trying to locate a Donnie Weboy.
00:22:48.658,00:22:52.162,-He's got family over in North Dakota. -I know the name.
00:22:52.245,00:22:54.915,"Not Donnie, but Weboy, sure."
00:22:58.627,00:23:00.587,"Well, he married our son's widow."
00:23:01.880,00:23:03.590,Got our grandson with them.
00:23:03.965,00:23:05.509,Boy's only three.
00:23:07.594,00:23:11.723,"We just want to know where they are, make sure-- make sure they're safe."
00:23:16.728,00:23:18.605,Let me call around some.
00:23:26.446,00:23:27.989,How's that pot roast?
00:23:32.828,00:23:34.454,Yours is better.
00:23:37.958,00:23:39.209,Hmm.
00:23:40.585,00:23:42.254,You're just used to mine.
00:24:27.007,00:24:28.258,Happy?
00:24:29.134,00:24:30.844,Happy not to hear a lecture.
00:24:35.599,00:24:37.517,Gonna hide the evidence.
00:24:55.368,00:24:56.828,Margaret!
00:25:05.962,00:25:07.422,"What the hell, Margaret?"
00:25:09.674,00:25:11.468,-That was before-- -What the hell?
00:25:13.220,00:25:15.222,That was before I knew you were coming.
00:25:16.514,00:25:17.849,You thought you'd need it?
00:25:17.933,00:25:20.393,I didn't want to find out I did and not have it.
00:25:22.646,00:25:25.690,"Christ, Margaret. Was this gonna be part of your argument?"
00:25:25.774,00:25:28.568,"-George, I would never-- -It's got bullets in it."
00:25:43.917,00:25:47.587,There's a branch of the Weboy clan over in Forsyth. Townsfolk.
00:25:48.630,00:25:51.299,Trailhead Saddlery there is a Weboy operation.
00:25:51.383,00:25:53.176,Or it was started by the family.
00:25:53.885,00:25:56.471,"Ain't North Dakota, but I'd start there."
00:25:56.805,00:25:59.557,That's what we'll do then. Appreciate your help.
00:26:00.183,00:26:03.186,We're also hoping you might recommend a hotel in town for the night.
00:26:03.270,00:26:04.562,Anyplace clean.
00:26:04.646,00:26:07.857,"Well, if clean's the priority, my Sally keeps the jail here."
00:26:08.358,00:26:09.609,Cells are empty.
00:26:09.693,00:26:11.319,And we got fresh sheets.
00:26:11.820,00:26:13.905,Not sure what feelings you got on it.
00:26:13.989,00:26:15.699,We'd be right at home.
00:26:16.116,00:26:18.243,"-Thank you, Sheriff Nevelson. -My pleasure."
00:26:23.999,00:26:25.625,You think they're trying to run?
00:26:29.671,00:26:31.214,"No, not that I know."
00:26:32.674,00:26:34.592,But they did take off in a hurry.
00:26:35.176,00:26:36.803,Forgot to say goodbye.
00:26:38.305,00:26:40.181,I'm just looking to give her that.
00:26:43.935,00:26:45.895,Let her say goodbye.
00:29:15.128,00:29:16.796,Go home.
00:29:17.922,00:29:19.424,Go home.
00:29:51.372,00:29:53.416,I was saved.
00:29:54.542,00:30:08.640,"But you'll be drowning in a lake of fire, because that's the decision you made-- -Turn it back on if you want. -Sounds like your daddy."
00:30:08.723,00:30:10.141,Thumping his Bible.
00:30:12.310,00:30:14.103,Wasn't just Bibles he thumped.
00:30:28.201,00:30:29.744,Good morning.
00:30:38.628,00:30:39.963,Beautiful saddles.
00:30:40.713,00:30:42.340,"Wouldn't you say, George?"
00:30:44.092,00:30:47.345,"Fella in Miles City makes 'em, the fancy ones."
00:30:47.428,00:30:48.513,Oh.
00:30:49.305,00:30:51.474,"Well, very impressive."
00:30:56.646,00:30:58.898,Or bridles and bits.
00:30:59.566,00:31:03.278,"Now, uh… would you be a Weboy?"
00:31:03.862,00:31:06.865,"No, ma'am. I'm a cousin to. I'm a Tucker."
00:31:06.948,00:31:09.576,"Oh. Well, then we're related too."
00:31:10.326,00:31:12.871,Donnie Weboy's married to our daughter-in-law.
00:31:12.954,00:31:16.541,Former daughter-in-law. Which makes him stepdaddy to our grandson.
00:31:20.044,00:31:25.842,"My husband and I found ourselves in this part of the state, so I said, Let's look in on Lorna and Donnie while we're here."
00:31:26.676,00:31:28.136,So here we are.
00:31:28.887,00:31:31.389,I don't know no Donnie or a Laura.
00:31:31.472,00:31:35.602,"Hmm. Well, I understood it was why they relocated here."
00:31:35.685,00:31:38.521,Donnie was going to hire on at his uncle's saddlery.
00:31:39.606,00:31:41.858,"-Who? -George, didn't Lorna say?"
00:31:42.317,00:31:44.110,You sure you don't want Gladstone?
00:31:44.986,00:31:46.154,Gladstone?
00:31:46.237,00:31:47.530,North Dakota.
00:31:47.614,00:31:49.324,Just the other side of the line.
00:31:50.116,00:31:54.871,"It's not like they got work there either, no good work anyway, but they got a Weboy or two."
00:31:58.666,00:32:03.630,Though I don't know why Lorna and Donnie were talking up Forsyth like they did.
00:32:03.713,00:32:05.381,What was your names again?
00:32:06.174,00:32:11.012,"Any idea who we might ask to find Donnie, if we went to Gladstone?"
00:32:15.850,00:32:21.356,"You let it be known you're looking for a Weboy, they'll find you."
00:33:00.061,00:33:01.771,"You're with me on this, right?"
00:33:02.188,00:33:03.731,Who's been doing the driving?
00:33:07.402,00:33:09.320,You could say you want him back.
00:33:10.071,00:33:11.572,I haven't heard that yet.
00:33:15.827,00:33:17.328,"We're not young, Margaret."
00:33:21.499,00:33:23.209,"Well, we're not old."
00:33:23.751,00:33:25.086,We're not young.
00:33:26.504,00:33:28.256,You saying you don't miss him?
00:33:28.339,00:33:30.550,I'm saying that he's not even in school yet.
00:33:30.633,00:33:33.553,Hasn't had measles or rode a bike.
00:33:35.930,00:33:37.181,He's young.
00:33:39.183,00:33:40.476,And we're not.
00:33:43.229,00:33:50.987,"Well… you can drive me into town then drop me off, turn around and take yourself back home."
00:33:52.572,00:33:54.032,I'll do what I need to do.
00:33:55.616,00:33:58.202,I'll take a bus back to Dalton with Jimmy.
00:34:00.121,00:34:02.498,Yeah. Once Lorna's handed him to you?
00:34:03.958,00:34:06.419,"A smile on her face, happy as a clam?"
00:34:07.754,00:34:09.797,"And if they're not down there, what?"
00:34:16.012,00:34:19.098,You just gonna chase them around the country on a bus? Hmm?
00:34:19.182,00:34:22.477,-What if they go where Greyhound doesn't? -Then I'll walk.
00:34:23.686,00:34:25.313,"You would, too, wouldn't you?"
00:34:30.902,00:34:37.116,"And when you finally learn that what you want to make happen isn't gonna happen, what then, Margaret Meloy?"
00:34:38.993,00:34:41.996,"Well, then I suppose I'll learn what I've never been able to."
00:34:42.830,00:34:44.749,Isn't that what you've always told me?
00:34:45.166,00:34:49.962,Over and over that I… don't know when it's time to call it quits.
00:34:54.175,00:34:58.262,"And I'll be the one gets the job of picking up those pieces, huh?"
00:35:10.608,00:35:11.818,Hey.
00:35:16.114,00:35:18.116,"No, no, no. You just hold it."
00:35:18.199,00:35:19.367,Hold it right there.
00:35:19.450,00:35:22.745,"I didn't take nothing, all right? I just… You were just what?"
00:35:23.955,00:35:25.498,"Well, I was fishing."
00:35:29.585,00:35:30.920,Fishing around this car?
00:35:31.003,00:35:32.380,"Well, no. No, sir."
00:35:32.463,00:35:34.507,"No, I'm just coming from fishing."
00:35:35.424,00:35:39.887,"I just seen your car, and I was just wondering who's setting up camp out here, that's all."
00:35:39.971,00:35:43.182,"-Who are you? -Peter Dragswolf, sir."
00:35:44.016,00:35:45.601,I live over there.
00:35:45.685,00:35:47.353,Have my own place.
00:35:47.937,00:35:50.982,I've got my own money too. I don't need none of your goods.
00:35:51.107,00:35:53.609,"I'm Margaret Blackledge, Mr. Dragswolf."
00:35:54.694,00:35:56.320,"That's my husband, George."
00:35:56.404,00:35:58.364,I apologize if we're trespassing.
00:35:59.073,00:36:00.908,And what's this fella's name?
00:36:00.992,00:36:03.536,I can't say. He don't belong to me.
00:36:04.579,00:36:06.998,Just showed up outside my shack one morning.
00:36:07.081,00:36:10.334,"I thought he was wild at first, but he come from somewhere."
00:36:10.459,00:36:11.878,I don't know.
00:36:12.962,00:36:14.505,But he found me.
00:36:17.466,00:36:18.843,Same as us.
00:36:31.439,00:36:33.482,Maybe the horse belongs to her.
00:36:35.943,00:36:37.904,Near about every horse does.
00:36:54.003,00:36:55.880,I used to ride.
00:36:58.424,00:37:00.343,I used to break horses.
00:37:02.553,00:37:05.181,With our son. James.
00:37:06.682,00:37:08.226,Then he died.
00:37:10.645,00:37:14.065,And I guess I lost my appetite for it.
00:37:14.732,00:37:17.485,Haven't kept animals in quite a while.
00:37:18.569,00:37:21.530,It's nice to spend some time with a sweet one like yours.
00:37:21.614,00:37:24.283,What about you? How long you been out here?
00:37:26.869,00:37:27.954,Three years.
00:37:28.037,00:37:30.873,All on your own? No family?
00:37:39.548,00:37:41.342,"Indian school, sir."
00:37:42.301,00:37:43.970,You don't have to call me sir.
00:37:44.679,00:37:46.347,George will do the job.
00:37:49.809,00:37:52.937,You finished that school? How old are you?
00:37:59.694,00:38:01.112,I don't bother anybody.
00:38:02.363,00:38:06.117,"You know, if somebody comes for the horse, they can have him back."
00:38:06.200,00:38:08.577,"The skins I sell, those animals I catch."
00:38:08.953,00:38:11.122,"The fish are free, and I don't steal."
00:38:11.455,00:38:15.501,"-I mind my own business. -Peter, come. Have some cake."
00:38:15.584,00:38:17.837,Why don't you sit back at the fire with us?
00:38:31.100,00:38:34.395,"You're familiar with the area, though? Gladstone?"
00:38:34.729,00:38:38.399,I can tell you where the folks are buried that ain't buried in the cemeteries.
00:38:39.608,00:38:40.526,Weboys?
00:38:41.944,00:38:43.738,You had any dealings with them?
00:38:46.949,00:38:48.659,We're looking for our grandson.
00:38:48.743,00:38:50.202,Our boy's boy.
00:38:52.204,00:38:54.123,He's with a man named Donnie Weboy.
00:38:54.206,00:38:55.916,-You ever heard of him? -No.
00:38:56.751,00:39:00.880,"No, but if you're looking in Gladstone, look for Bill Weboy."
00:39:01.172,00:39:02.715,You think he'd help us?
00:39:02.798,00:39:04.467,"Help, maybe."
00:39:07.261,00:39:08.387,But go careful.
00:39:20.066,00:39:22.777,There it is. Yellow house.
00:39:47.176,00:39:50.012,-Mr. Weboy? -Who's asking?
00:39:50.096,00:39:51.430,Margaret Blackledge.
00:39:52.348,00:39:53.766,And my husband George.
00:40:00.773,00:40:02.983,"Bill Weboy. A cousin, are you?"
00:40:08.614,00:40:11.325,Our former daughter-in-law married a Donnie Weboy.
00:40:12.034,00:40:13.953,He's stepdad to our grandson now.
00:40:15.162,00:40:16.956,"That's pretty tangled up, isn't it?"
00:40:21.627,00:40:24.213,We heard they might have come to settle here in Gladstone.
00:40:24.296,00:40:28.884,"We thought we'd pay a visit, see our grandson Jimmy, since we're in the neighborhood."
00:40:29.552,00:40:31.303,Since you're in the neighborhood.
00:40:31.804,00:40:34.223,And since you didn't find them up in Forsyth.
00:40:38.018,00:40:40.521,"-You heard we were coming, did you? -I did. I did."
00:40:40.604,00:40:43.023,A little birdie flew over here ahead of you.
00:40:43.107,00:40:45.568,"-Cheep, ch-cheep, cheep-- -Are they here or not?"
00:40:47.361,00:40:49.363,"Is he always like that, in a big old hurry?"
00:40:49.530,00:40:51.574,My husband likes to get down to business.
00:40:51.657,00:40:54.743,Hell lot of men are like that. Can't wait to get where they're going.
00:40:56.328,00:41:00.082,"Women, in my experience, would as soon take their time."
00:41:00.166,00:41:02.001,"Enjoy the ride, so to speak."
00:41:02.084,00:41:05.379,"-Mr. Weboy, I'm gonna tell you one time-- -I'm just funnin' you, George."
00:41:05.754,00:41:08.257,They're here. Donnie's my nephew.
00:41:08.340,00:41:10.926,They're safe and sound over at his mom's place.
00:41:12.845,00:41:15.848,Why don't we head on inside and give the old homestead a call.
00:41:16.348,00:41:20.936,"Hell, you might be able to drive over this morning, see that little precious grandson of yours."
00:41:32.156,00:41:33.073,"Hey, Mabel."
00:41:33.157,00:41:35.743,Can you put me through to the ranch?
00:41:39.205,00:41:40.789,"Blanche, it's Bill."
00:41:58.057,00:41:59.850,You two have plans for supper?
00:41:59.934,00:42:01.560,We surely don't.
00:42:02.102,00:42:05.356,How'd you like to be guests of the Weboy clan out at the ranch?
00:42:06.857,00:42:09.401,-We don't want to be any trouble. -No trouble at all.
00:42:09.485,00:42:11.320,My sister-in-law wants to meet you.
00:42:12.321,00:42:15.950,She wants to swap some old grandpa and grandma stories.
00:42:16.033,00:42:18.452,"And between you and me, she's a hell of a cook."
00:42:18.536,00:42:20.996,"Well, you'd have to give us directions."
00:42:21.080,00:42:22.665,Nope. Not a chance.
00:42:22.748,00:42:26.126,"I could be the best damn direction giver in the world, and you'd never find her."
00:42:26.210,00:42:30.089,You'd be out there wandering around Four Bridges Road and never see a one. No.
00:42:30.172,00:42:34.218,"You make your way back here at 4:00, and you can follow me."
00:42:35.469,00:42:37.346,Thank you. We'll come back then.
00:43:02.788,00:43:04.456,About time.
00:43:04.540,00:43:08.627,One of you should ride with me and the other follow.
00:43:08.711,00:43:14.216,"I could tell you where we're going and why, and that way, maybe you can find your way back on your own."
00:43:22.474,00:43:26.020,Well… Where do you think you're going?
00:43:26.103,00:43:28.272,You think he wants you in the passenger seat?
00:43:28.355,00:43:29.398,No.
00:43:30.065,00:43:31.692,I know he doesn't.
00:43:35.529,00:43:38.032,I don't care what he wants. I'm going. You drive.
00:43:38.115,00:43:39.950,"-It's fine, George. -Margaret."
00:43:40.034,00:43:43.245,"Margaret. Margaret, get back in-- Follow close."
00:44:02.973,00:44:06.602,"Pretty bird, that old jalopy won't have trouble keeping up, will it?"
00:44:06.685,00:44:09.897,You're looking in the mirror often enough. You can see where he is.
00:44:09.980,00:44:12.691,I guess he just don't want you to get too far out of his sight.
00:44:15.778,00:44:17.112,You mind?
00:44:18.155,00:44:21.617,It's your car. You don't need my permission.
00:44:21.909,00:44:26.163,You strike me as the kind of woman men are always asking permission of.
00:44:26.246,00:44:27.998,"An expert, are you?"
00:44:33.879,00:44:39.259,I've been around more than a few women who want men to ask before drawing a breath.
00:44:42.721,00:44:43.806,We turn here.
00:44:43.889,00:44:46.475,Why don't you signal so George knows what's coming?
00:45:13.794,00:45:15.796,How much further is it?
00:45:15.879,00:45:18.382,"Uh, farther? How much farther is it?"
00:45:18.465,00:45:20.968,Or do you mean how much more of me do you have to put up with?
00:45:21.093,00:45:23.053,We just want to see Jimmy.
00:45:23.137,00:45:24.763,Yeah.
00:45:26.014,00:45:27.891,He's a good-looking boy there.
00:45:27.975,00:45:30.227,And his mother's a fine-looking woman.
00:45:32.396,00:45:37.317,"You know, Donnie never asked me for a word of advice in his life."
00:45:39.486,00:45:42.948,"And if he had, I would've told him to do exactly what he's done."
00:45:43.073,00:45:45.159,"Marry yourself a widow, Donnie."
00:45:45.451,00:45:47.411,You'll be getting a grateful woman.
00:46:40.839,00:46:43.717,"Never would've found this place on your own, am I right?"
00:46:45.052,00:46:46.386,Was I right?
00:46:46.470,00:46:47.638,Through here.
00:46:51.725,00:46:52.851,Blanche!
00:46:54.394,00:46:55.771,We're here.
00:46:57.439,00:46:58.941,Blanche?
00:47:19.628,00:47:21.630,I hope you like pork chops.
00:47:25.884,00:47:27.928,-You're the grandma. -I am.
00:47:28.011,00:47:29.304,Margaret Blackledge.
00:47:29.388,00:47:31.139,Blanche Weboy.
00:47:31.223,00:47:32.808,Thanks for having us.
00:47:32.891,00:47:34.268,And you're the lawman.
00:47:34.351,00:47:36.895,"Retired, ma'am. George Blackledge."
00:47:36.979,00:47:41.692,"Well, why don't we all retire to a seat at the table, huh?"
00:47:42.442,00:47:43.485,Shall we?
00:47:48.824,00:47:52.369,"Now, who can I interest in a glass? Hmm?"
00:47:52.452,00:47:53.954,"Oh, no, thank you."
00:47:57.708,00:48:02.004,Ah. Well… I don't mind drinking alone.
00:48:11.430,00:48:14.349,My people originally came from Illinois.
00:48:14.433,00:48:19.187,Filed a homestead claim north of Gladstone before there was a Gladstone.
00:48:20.397,00:48:21.898,I'm one of eight.
00:48:24.026,00:48:26.612,Lost an older sister to pneumonia.
00:48:26.903,00:48:30.198,My brother Carl drowned in a neighbor's cistern.
00:48:30.782,00:48:34.953,"Another fell off a truck, lived in a wheelchair for the rest of his days."
00:48:35.037,00:48:41.877,"My aunt Ruth got caught in a whiteout, froze and died right where she stood, not 30 feet from that back door."
00:48:43.503,00:48:44.713,Hard life.
00:48:45.380,00:48:47.049,Not for everyone.
00:48:55.098,00:48:56.808,Never looked back.
00:49:00.646,00:49:01.772,I stayed.
00:49:03.649,00:49:10.739,"When I first met Henry Weboy, he couldn't stop talking about heading for Florida."
00:49:12.949,00:49:16.745,I figure I had more than a little to do with his decision to stay.
00:49:20.791,00:49:26.213,Now he's buried in the same cemetery as my folks and his.
00:49:27.214,00:49:28.882,Yeah.
00:49:28.965,00:49:36.390,"And my boys are fourth-generation Weboys, born and living on North Dakota soil."
00:49:47.317,00:49:49.403,You came to eat! Ha!
00:49:51.363,00:49:54.324,"Why don't you call the boys in for supper, huh?"
00:49:54.908,00:49:56.535,I'll be back in a jiffy.
00:50:01.998,00:50:05.210,"not a hell of a lot different, am I right?"
00:50:05.293,00:50:11.216,"About family, hardships, sacrifice, blood."
00:50:12.384,00:50:13.677,"Ah, meet the boys."
00:50:14.386,00:50:16.888,Tall one's Elton. The other's Marvin.
00:50:17.556,00:50:19.141,Say hello to our guests.
00:50:20.434,00:50:22.394,That your wagon out there?
00:50:22.644,00:50:25.647,"We tried to get inside, take a look."
00:50:26.940,00:50:29.985,"Tighten a couple bolts, we could probably get you a few more horses."
00:50:32.821,00:50:35.240,Where's Jimmy? Where's the boy?
00:50:35.323,00:50:36.950,"Why, he's not here."
00:50:37.576,00:50:43.206,-He's with his father. -His father-- We came to see our grandson.
00:50:43.749,00:50:46.084,You mean you didn't come here to eat my pork chops?
00:50:48.420,00:50:53.884,If you brought us all the way out here for the sake of a joke… Lorna said you were rough bark.
00:50:54.217,00:50:57.262,And I can see already you're no day at the races.
00:50:59.931,00:51:01.892,"Come on, everybody. Sit down."
00:51:02.559,00:51:04.728,It's not gonna get any better cold.
00:51:16.072,00:51:18.074,Your grandson's with my Donnie.
00:51:19.409,00:51:22.329,He took Jimmy along to pick up the boy's mother from work.
00:51:22.412,00:51:23.705,Lorna?
00:51:24.247,00:51:26.082,She's working at Monkey Ward.
00:51:26.917,00:51:30.420,We could've seen Jimmy and Lorna in Gladstone?
00:51:30.504,00:51:32.798,"Oh, now I am feeling insulted by you."
00:51:32.881,00:51:35.050,You really don't give a damn about sharing a meal.
00:51:35.133,00:51:37.010,-I just meant-- -Or maybe you're a Jew.
00:51:38.094,00:51:40.138,Maybe you can't eat pork chops.
00:51:45.310,00:51:47.229,Breathe easy.
00:51:47.312,00:51:50.357,Anyone who knows me knows I can't be insulted.
00:51:50.440,00:51:52.025,Eat my chops or don't.
00:51:52.484,00:51:56.154,"Well, we'd certainly hoped to meet Donnie's family someday."
00:51:56.238,00:51:57.447,"Oh, had you?"
00:51:58.782,00:52:01.368,"Well, I'm glad to learn that."
00:52:02.869,00:52:05.121,"Yeah, I thought we should meet too."
00:52:06.665,00:52:08.416,Have ourselves a chat.
00:52:09.960,00:52:17.425,"Would've been nice if it had been at the wedding, but… maybe it was too much to ask for his mother to be invited or his brothers."
00:52:19.427,00:52:22.055,-You weren't invited? -You recollect seeing us there?
00:52:22.764,00:52:23.974,And that's our fault?
00:52:24.057,00:52:27.811,"You didn't stop to think to yourselves, He must've come from somewhere."
00:52:28.270,00:52:30.146,Must have family.
00:52:34.067,00:52:37.112,"Frankly, we thought only that Donnie was a grown man."
00:52:42.617,00:52:44.202,Your son's dead.
00:52:46.788,00:52:48.832,It's understandable you forget.
00:52:49.958,00:52:52.168,We're never really done raising them.
00:52:52.836,00:52:54.629,Teaching them the right way.
00:52:57.090,00:52:59.426,It's why I had to bring my boy home.
00:53:00.969,00:53:02.512,To keep an eye on him.
00:53:04.848,00:53:06.391,Your boy's perfect now.
00:53:06.892,00:53:09.394,It's not really fair to compare him and Donnie.
00:53:09.477,00:53:12.147,I wouldn't ever compare Donnie to our son.
00:53:15.775,00:53:19.404,"Yeah, he said that you two don't approve."
00:53:19.654,00:53:22.365,I'm surprised to hear he gives a damn what we think.
00:53:25.160,00:53:28.079,He couldn't be bothered to tell us they were leaving.
00:53:28.163,00:53:30.415,My boy doesn't have to answer to you.
00:53:33.710,00:53:35.378,he does not.
00:53:35.754,00:53:38.340,And we don't have to answer to you.
00:53:46.640,00:53:52.354,We better get some food in our bellies before this get-together turns into a real blood feud.
00:53:56.858,00:54:00.779,"Oh, why, here come the newlyweds now."
00:54:12.540,00:54:13.416,Lorna.
00:54:14.960,00:54:16.336,"H-Hi, George."
00:54:18.964,00:54:20.090,"Hi, Jimmy."
00:54:33.603,00:54:36.231,He's turning into quite a load.
00:54:37.440,00:54:39.401,"I told you, you carry him too much."
00:54:40.694,00:54:42.153,How's he supposed to learn?
00:54:42.237,00:54:44.656,Learn what? How to walk? He knows how to walk.
00:54:46.616,00:54:49.160,if someone carried me everywhere I wanted to go.
00:54:50.453,00:54:51.913,It's flat-out spoiling him.
00:54:52.664,00:54:55.083,-He weighs nothing. -Has he eaten?
00:54:55.166,00:54:57.210,Got him a burger at Ressler's while we were waiting.
00:55:04.759,00:55:05.719,Huh?
00:55:05.802,00:55:08.013,-Should I cut up a little meat for you? -No.
00:55:08.430,00:55:10.890,What was that? What are you supposed to say?
00:55:10.974,00:55:12.517,"No, thank you."
00:55:14.602,00:55:15.937,Take him up to bed then.
00:55:16.563,00:55:19.357,What? He just got here.
00:55:19.441,00:55:22.193,We believe in early to bed in this house.
00:55:22.777,00:55:26.489,And we believe in walking upstairs on our own two feet.
00:55:36.124,00:55:38.752,You know who makes the rules around here.
00:56:30.386,00:56:32.097,There was mustard.
00:56:32.639,00:56:34.390,There was mustard?
00:56:35.058,00:56:36.643,On your hamburger?
00:56:38.812,00:56:40.814,"You don't like mustard, do you?"
00:57:13.179,00:57:14.347,That's enough.
00:57:15.014,00:57:18.184,"Well, now you know where to find us, you'll have to visit more often."
00:57:18.852,00:57:22.480,"We thank you, but we'll… be on our way."
00:57:27.819,00:57:29.237,Hold up there!
00:57:35.827,00:57:51.092,"You know, if you left a trail of bread crumbs, You know, she won't say so, but I can tell, you running off like this, you hurt Blanche's feelings."
00:57:51.176,00:57:52.802,Her feelings?
00:57:52.886,00:58:01.811,"We've come all this way to see Jimmy, and she gives us two minutes' time to visit with him-- Go back inside, Mr. Weboy."
00:58:02.812,00:58:04.189,Why was your car locked?
00:58:17.827,00:58:19.704,What are you doing out here?
00:58:21.998,00:58:23.416,Damned if I know.
00:59:09.671,00:59:11.256,"Today's Friday, right?"
00:59:12.757,00:59:14.175,It is.
00:59:16.261,00:59:18.721,Do you think Lorna will be working tomorrow?
00:59:21.099,00:59:23.726,It's not quite as slimming as this would be.
00:59:23.810,00:59:25.979,"You know, beautiful white shirt like this."
00:59:26.813,00:59:28.648,-I'll take it. -Oh.
00:59:36.030,00:59:38.074,So just these two things for you then?
00:59:38.157,00:59:39.367,"Yes, thank you."
00:59:51.921,00:59:53.172,"7.50, ma'am."
01:00:02.056,01:00:04.183,I didn't think you'd just go home.
01:00:05.268,01:00:06.728,I'm like a bad penny.
01:00:08.229,01:00:10.231,Who watches Jimmy while you're here?
01:00:10.315,01:00:11.566,Who do you think?
01:00:11.649,01:00:14.277,Donnie. His mom.
01:00:15.820,01:00:19.365,Or maybe you think I just tie him to a tree until I get home.
01:00:23.536,01:00:26.372,"-You're a good mother, Lorna. I know that. -Right."
01:00:28.458,01:00:32.003,I was merely wondering how things are going for you with this new job.
01:00:32.086,01:00:38.509,"Well, I just started, so… We don't want to get you in trouble, sweetheart."
01:00:39.052,01:00:40.511,Can we buy you lunch?
01:00:43.097,01:00:45.808,-Straight up? -We'll meet you outside.
01:00:45.892,01:00:48.353,"No, I'll meet you at Ressler's."
01:00:48.436,01:00:49.812,It's across the street.
01:01:03.201,01:01:07.330,"It was kind of a last-minute decision, coming here."
01:01:08.623,01:01:11.876,-That Donnie's decision? -You met Blanche.
01:01:13.544,01:01:16.297,"Well, we found you. That's what's important."
01:01:17.048,01:01:18.800,Jimmy looks bigger.
01:01:18.883,01:01:20.343,He's growing so fast.
01:01:20.426,01:01:22.303,He's counting to ten now.
01:01:22.595,01:01:26.724,"He used to just say the words, you know, but now he understands they go in order."
01:01:27.100,01:01:29.268,And I'm working with him on his alphabet.
01:01:29.769,01:01:31.729,He can spell his name.
01:01:39.612,01:01:42.281,"He misses you, both of you."
01:01:44.033,01:01:45.368,We miss him too.
01:01:47.036,01:01:48.121,Both of you.
01:01:48.204,01:01:50.748,"That's what we wanted to talk to you about, Lorna."
01:01:50.832,01:01:53.251,And I won't… beat around the bush.
01:01:57.046,01:01:59.716,I remember when James first introduced us.
01:02:01.092,01:02:10.101,"This wonderful girl he told us so much about, so beautiful and funny and… No family of her own, but… Thought you weren't gonna beat around the bush."
01:02:10.601,01:02:13.479,I have to be back at the store by 1:00. Just get to it.
01:02:13.563,01:02:16.733,"All right. Well, here it is."
01:02:19.610,01:02:21.404,Let Jimmy come back with us.
01:02:22.530,01:02:25.450,Not just to visit. I mean for good.
01:02:28.578,01:02:34.876,You… You want me to give Jimmy to you?
01:02:38.337,01:02:41.132,"a good home, one he knows, one he-- Stop."
01:02:41.215,01:02:45.261,"You know the schools he'd go to, the teachers-- No, God, stop! I can't hear this!"
01:02:51.934,01:02:56.439,I saw Donnie hit Jimmy.
01:02:58.357,01:02:59.650,On the street.
01:03:02.695,01:03:04.155,I saw him hit you.
01:03:04.864,01:03:06.783,And it didn't look like a first time.
01:03:09.702,01:03:12.497,"A little or a lot, no amount's good."
01:03:13.956,01:03:15.583,-That's why-- -You came to take him.
01:03:17.126,01:03:18.336,We came to help.
01:03:19.420,01:03:21.255,Whatever the situation is.
01:03:22.465,01:03:23.800,Jimmy can't stay there.
01:03:25.259,01:03:26.469,Can't stay here.
01:03:28.888,01:03:31.265,-He needs his mother. -Then come with us.
01:03:31.974,01:03:34.310,You and Jimmy. We'll take care of you.
01:03:34.393,01:03:36.229,"Live with us, like before."
01:03:36.312,01:03:37.271,Tuna.
01:03:43.486,01:03:44.654,There you go.
01:03:50.576,01:03:51.994,He'd kill me.
01:03:53.246,01:03:54.580,Him and his mother.
01:03:55.331,01:04:00.378,"She couldn't care less if I fell off the face of the earth, really, but she'd never let me go."
01:04:01.045,01:04:02.713,Or Jimmy.
01:04:05.174,01:04:07.009,Donnie got away from her once.
01:04:07.635,01:04:10.221,She's never going to let that happen again.
01:04:12.473,01:04:15.101,I don't want Jimmy to grow up like them.
01:04:26.904,01:04:28.114,Honey.
01:04:30.533,01:04:32.577,You want us to drive you out there?
01:04:32.660,01:04:34.120,We can do that.
01:04:34.203,01:04:35.621,Right now.
01:04:35.705,01:04:37.665,"Right, George?"
01:04:37.748,01:04:41.460,"The three of us, we can get Jimmy, -pack you up, take you back-- -No. No."
01:04:46.048,01:04:47.133,I'll meet you.
01:04:50.386,01:04:52.430,Everybody's usually asleep by midnight.
01:04:53.848,01:04:57.184,I'll have to wait to be sure.
01:04:59.020,01:05:00.646,"We should come get you, sweetheart."
01:05:00.730,01:05:02.648,No. This is the way.
01:05:03.149,01:05:05.234,"The safest way, trust me."
01:05:05.610,01:05:09.196,"That's-- That's what everyone wants most, isn't it?"
01:05:10.323,01:05:13.492,For you and Jimmy to be safe. Hmm?
01:05:14.911,01:05:15.953,And happy.
01:05:18.039,01:05:19.707,We're out at the Moon Wink.
01:05:21.042,01:05:25.254,-'Kay. -Cabin seven at the Moon Wink Motor-- I heard you. I know where it is.
01:05:26.881,01:05:28.591,I should be there by 2:00.
01:05:29.884,01:05:32.261,But we have to leave right when I get there.
01:05:32.720,01:05:33.888,No waiting.
01:05:38.017,01:05:39.352,Okay.
01:05:39.435,01:05:41.228,"Lorna, wait."
01:05:42.939,01:05:44.398,Wait. Lorna.
01:05:46.525,01:05:54.825,"I… I know we haven't always seen eye to eye, but-- I don't think we've ever seen eye to eye."
01:05:56.744,01:05:58.788,Well… we will.
01:05:59.789,01:06:02.667,You're just saying that to make sure that I go with you.
01:06:05.127,01:06:07.004,Jimmy needs his mother.
01:06:09.882,01:06:11.759,You could've used one too.
01:06:15.930,01:06:17.556,I could've been that to you.
01:06:18.599,01:06:20.309,I should've been.
01:06:21.644,01:06:22.728,But I wasn't.
01:06:25.022,01:06:26.232,It's okay.
01:06:28.359,01:06:29.652,"I'm sorry, Lorna."
01:06:33.447,01:06:36.325,I should've been… much more to you.
01:08:14.673,01:08:16.842,Don't start what you can't finish.
01:08:47.206,01:08:50.584,Can you… answer something for me?
01:08:51.752,01:08:52.795,Okay.
01:08:54.255,01:08:57.007,"That horse of yours, Strawberry."
01:08:57.550,01:08:58.759,Strawberry?
01:09:02.680,01:09:03.931,What brought that up?
01:09:05.099,01:09:06.725,Seeing you ride again.
01:09:06.809,01:09:07.893,Hmm.
01:09:11.105,01:09:15.568,"Something I always wondered about, when we had to put her down."
01:09:17.820,01:09:19.822,You whispered to her. Do you remember?
01:09:20.614,01:09:21.740,Yeah.
01:09:21.824,01:09:25.035,Like you were telling secrets.
01:09:28.622,01:09:30.207,What was it you told her?
01:09:37.464,01:09:38.966,I reminded her of things.
01:09:41.010,01:09:44.847,How she liked to gallop through the first snow every year.
01:09:44.930,01:09:50.978,About the time we raced Ernie Dahlberg and his big chocolate mare and left them choking in our dust.
01:09:52.271,01:09:54.398,I reminded her of this one time.
01:09:54.481,01:09:58.527,"I was in high school-- it was some October, and we were heading home."
01:09:59.320,01:10:02.323,And the full moon was just coming up over Dollar Butte.
01:10:03.157,01:10:04.617,And she stopped.
01:10:04.700,01:10:06.744,Stopped and stared.
01:10:07.745,01:10:10.164,Like she cared about the moonrise as much as me.
01:10:13.167,01:10:20.466,And when we put James on her back for the very first time… she stood so still.
01:10:22.384,01:10:24.803,Like she knew she had to take care of him.
01:10:34.605,01:10:37.691,I wanted to send her on her way with happy memories.
01:10:43.656,01:10:45.282,I'm sorry.
01:10:46.700,01:10:48.953,Sorry? Why?
01:10:49.036,01:10:54.041,I made you sad. That's… That's not what I wanted.
01:10:56.585,01:10:58.754,"You didn't make me sad, George."
01:11:07.012,01:11:13.602,What I wanted is to tell you… tell you what sticks with me.
01:11:17.690,01:11:19.191,Strawberry and you.
01:11:21.902,01:11:24.655,This woman I married but can't figure.
01:11:26.699,01:11:32.579,"Who doesn't believe there's any world but this one, but still believes a horse has got a soul somehow."
01:11:38.085,01:11:39.962,That's the gal for me.
01:12:08.657,01:12:10.617,She did seem quick to come around.
01:12:10.701,01:12:11.952,Please.
01:12:13.162,01:12:14.413,Don't say anything.
01:13:43.252,01:13:44.294,Get out.
01:13:46.171,01:13:47.756,"No, you get the hell out now."
01:13:53.846,01:13:54.847,He let us in.
01:13:56.098,01:13:58.725,"See, you think you can gang up on Lorna."
01:13:59.476,01:14:02.771,"But when it's done to you, it's a different story."
01:14:02.855,01:14:04.106,What are you talking about?
01:14:04.189,01:14:06.024,"Oh, is that what you're gonna do?"
01:14:06.108,01:14:08.944,Pretend like you two didn't jump Lorna at work?
01:14:09.319,01:14:10.362,Shame on you.
01:14:10.446,01:14:14.074,"Shame on both of you, badgering and bullying her to give up her boy."
01:14:14.324,01:14:17.327,You're lucky Lorna doesn't have a little mama grizzly in her.
01:14:17.911,01:14:22.708,"Come between that kind of mama and her baby, you're fixin' to get your hand bit, or worse than."
01:14:24.001,01:14:31.467,Somebody tried to come between me and one of my boys… -tried to talk me out of my child-- -That's not what happened.
01:14:31.550,01:14:33.927,It's no wonder Lorna don't want to go with you.
01:14:34.011,01:14:35.596,Big bull-hen.
01:14:36.513,01:14:38.891,Thinking you know what's best for everybody.
01:14:38.974,01:14:40.893,"Pecking you to death, no doubt."
01:14:40.976,01:14:42.978,I never said she shouldn't marry Donnie.
01:14:43.061,01:14:44.313,I never said you did.
01:14:50.944,01:14:52.362,He hit the boy.
01:14:54.490,01:14:57.367,"I saw you, across the street from the grocery."
01:15:00.287,01:15:02.915,"Grandma, are you gonna tell me you didn't paddle your own, huh?"
01:15:02.998,01:15:03.957,Not ever?
01:15:04.875,01:15:06.668,He hit Lorna too.
01:15:12.466,01:15:13.675,Come here.
01:15:22.142,01:15:23.352,You hit your wife?
01:15:28.315,01:15:30.400,-How'd he do it? -With his hand.
01:15:33.487,01:15:36.198,"Alberta Einstein. Yeah, I know with his hand."
01:15:36.281,01:15:37.991,I'm asking how.
01:15:39.034,01:15:42.788,Like… Hmm?
01:15:42.871,01:15:44.790,Was it like that?
01:15:48.126,01:15:50.254,"Donnie, how'd you do it? How was it?"
01:15:53.006,01:15:54.049,It was harder.
01:15:54.132,01:15:55.717,Harder?
01:15:58.971,01:16:03.308,Like… Goddamn it.
01:16:05.894,01:16:07.062,Like that?
01:16:09.106,01:16:10.274,Like that but harder.
01:16:13.277,01:16:18.574,Donnie… think you're gonna have to show us how you done it.
01:16:43.140,01:16:44.558,George!
01:16:46.518,01:16:48.895,"Oh, no, he's all right, Margaret. He's fine."
01:16:52.649,01:16:55.652,"Maybe you want to try talking this over again now, huh?"
01:16:56.236,01:16:57.779,Like reasonable folks.
01:16:58.614,01:17:03.702,"Or maybe you'd prefer getting some sleep, so you can get an early start back home tomorrow."
01:17:04.536,01:17:09.916,Or maybe… maybe you'd like to send him home while you stay on here for a spell.
01:17:10.000,01:17:12.169,I could take you back when you're ready.
01:17:14.046,01:17:19.092,"Of course, by then, you might decide you want to stay."
01:17:24.598,01:17:27.934,"It's okay. Easy, girl. Easy, girl."
01:17:32.105,01:17:33.690,You stop right there.
01:17:37.903,01:17:41.698,You… you stay away from us.
01:18:20.654,01:18:22.030,Donnie.
01:18:25.909,01:18:27.577,What do you want me to do?
01:18:28.495,01:18:30.539,You make sure he can't pull a gun on us again.
01:18:38.255,01:18:39.631,No.
01:18:41.341,01:18:43.009,-No. -No!
01:18:46.513,01:18:47.889,No!
01:18:49.182,01:18:50.767,"Go on, Donnie."
01:18:50.851,01:18:52.144,Come on.
01:19:02.779,01:19:03.947,Donnie.
01:19:08.410,01:19:10.078,You don't have to do this.
01:19:11.788,01:19:13.790,"Please, Donnie! Please, Donnie. Please, Donnie."
01:19:13.874,01:19:15.417,"-Donnie, don't do it. -Do it, boy."
01:19:25.469,01:19:27.095,"Oh, my God!"
01:19:30.015,01:19:32.309,George. George.
01:19:32.392,01:19:35.103,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
01:19:35.187,01:19:37.147,"Well, he won't be shooting for a while."
01:19:56.249,01:19:57.751,"Safe driving, you two."
01:20:04.257,01:20:06.176,"George, George, George."
01:20:06.259,01:20:07.761,"Oh, my God."
01:20:07.844,01:20:10.472,"What have I done to you? Oh, my God."
01:20:29.866,01:20:31.451,Police are on their way.
01:20:35.914,01:20:37.290,"Awake, right."
01:20:37.374,01:20:38.750,-Awake. -I'll stay awake.
01:20:38.834,01:20:40.544,"Yeah, you're okay."
01:20:40.627,01:20:41.837,Awake.
01:20:44.923,01:20:46.258,What?
01:21:28.800,01:21:34.097,"Well… Now, I already been over to the Weboys', had a chance to hear their side."
01:21:34.180,01:21:35.307,Their side?
01:21:35.682,01:21:36.892,Side of what?
01:21:37.767,01:21:41.021,Their account is that it's Mr. Blackledge here who pulled a gun.
01:21:41.104,01:21:42.856,In self-defense.
01:21:42.939,01:21:45.191,That your service revolver Blanche showed me?
01:21:46.735,01:21:48.069,I'm sure it is.
01:21:48.945,01:21:52.073,-You wore the badge once. -He wore it over 30 years.
01:21:52.157,01:21:56.119,Well… then you know how the law works.
01:21:58.663,01:22:01.750,I have a fair idea I know how it works here.
01:22:03.501,01:22:07.631,Blanche explained that things got a tad rough persuading you to set your weapon down.
01:22:07.714,01:22:09.299,They chopped his hand off.
01:22:09.507,01:22:14.721,"Yeah, well, the way they tell it, you two, you came here looking to take a child away from his mother."
01:22:15.096,01:22:19.267,"First with talk-- well, threats-- and then a gun."
01:22:19.351,01:22:21.937,"Lorna, the boy's mother, did you see her?"
01:22:22.020,01:22:23.605,"Oh, sure, she was there."
01:22:23.688,01:22:25.982,Did you speak with her? She's terrified of them.
01:22:26.066,01:22:28.234,"She was married to your son, right?"
01:22:28.944,01:22:30.070,Yes.
01:22:30.570,01:22:31.655,Hmm.
01:22:32.489,01:22:34.616,"And he died, right? He's dead."
01:22:35.241,01:22:37.035,How exactly did that happen?
01:22:39.412,01:22:41.164,Why don't you tell us?
01:22:42.499,01:22:46.086,"Well, um… an accident, she said."
01:22:46.544,01:22:50.465,"You know, was thrown from his horse, broke his neck, snapped in two."
01:22:53.885,01:22:55.136,An accident.
01:22:55.720,01:22:58.431,And it's an accident.
01:23:01.518,01:23:07.440,"You know, and Blanche… she expressed real concern about how accidents follow your family."
01:23:09.985,01:23:12.862,She fears for that little one she's looking after now.
01:23:14.155,01:23:20.537,"How the longer you two stick around, the chances of something happening to him, well, those chances, they just keep creeping up."
01:23:21.663,01:23:25.333,I don't even want to contemplate what a tragedy that would be.
01:23:26.960,01:23:31.131,There's nothing smaller in this world than a kid's casket.
01:23:34.217,01:23:35.468,Get out.
01:23:36.302,01:23:40.223,"Well, the consensus over there is that you two won't be causing any more trouble around here."
01:23:40.306,01:23:43.977,"And because you're family, by a way, the Weboys won't be pressing any charges."
01:23:44.060,01:23:46.062,So you're free to go.
01:23:46.896,01:23:50.358,"But, you know, if I were giving out advice-- You can save that."
01:23:50.442,01:23:52.819,"Well, see, I'm thinking of your grandson here."
01:23:54.070,01:23:55.530,He's a Weboy now.
01:23:59.951,01:24:02.203,It's best you put Gladstone behind you.
01:24:03.413,01:24:05.415,Just as quick as you can.
01:24:18.762,01:24:20.430,"Hey, pull over."
01:24:22.348,01:24:25.101,-What's wrong? -Goddamn it.
01:24:25.185,01:24:26.478,Pull over.
01:24:45.371,01:24:46.664,George.
01:24:47.165,01:24:48.917,Are you all right? Talk to me.
01:24:57.425,01:24:59.177,I needed to pull over is all.
01:26:42.614,01:26:43.948,So what will you do?
01:26:45.366,01:26:46.618,I don't know.
01:26:47.744,01:26:50.246,"Well, I heard what them Weboys done to you."
01:26:51.789,01:26:54.083,Except I didn't know it was you.
01:26:56.127,01:26:57.212,What did you hear?
01:26:57.295,01:26:59.631,"Well, that they chopped somebody's arm off."
01:27:00.882,01:27:02.050,Who told you that?
01:27:03.259,01:27:05.803,My uncle. In Gladstone.
01:27:06.971,01:27:08.598,So you have family in town then.
01:27:08.681,01:27:13.019,An uncle and an aunt. They sell skins for me.
01:27:13.353,01:27:14.562,And other stuff.
01:27:15.313,01:27:17.440,Why do you live all the way out here then?
01:27:17.982,01:27:19.025,All alone.
01:27:19.859,01:27:21.277,It's not where you're from.
01:27:25.406,01:27:27.992,'Cause I ran away from that school in Bismarck.
01:27:40.838,01:27:45.176,The government agents came into the house when I was eight.
01:27:47.470,01:27:50.556,They took me and put me in their truck.
01:27:53.768,01:27:58.064,"You know, I thought I did something wrong and that my mother didn't want me anymore."
01:28:01.943,01:28:04.070,But then I could see she was crying.
01:28:06.823,01:28:08.283,All the mothers were.
01:28:09.450,01:28:10.910,You were eight?
01:28:13.538,01:28:15.206,They cut my hair off.
01:28:16.791,01:28:18.167,And washed me in kerosene.
01:28:18.960,01:28:20.336,And beat me.
01:28:22.297,01:28:23.756,To kill the Indian inside.
01:28:27.552,01:28:29.012,I guess they did.
01:28:30.930,01:28:35.727,"So when I came home, I couldn't understand my grandmother's words anymore."
01:28:36.686,01:28:38.271,I'm Peter now.
01:28:39.397,01:28:40.732,Tried to tell her.
01:28:43.443,01:28:45.445,"She couldn't understand me, either."
01:28:51.159,01:28:58.207,If I don't belong anyplace… here is fine.
01:29:02.003,01:29:03.713,You picked a good spot.
01:29:06.424,01:29:08.301,But it's not good to be alone.
01:29:09.260,01:29:11.012,I'm not alone.
01:29:16.559,01:29:18.061,I'm talking to you.
01:29:35.078,01:29:36.454,I have an idea.
01:29:38.539,01:29:39.499,Yeah.
01:29:40.291,01:29:41.834,That's not a first.
01:29:41.918,01:29:44.128,Let me finish before you make fun of me.
01:29:44.212,01:29:46.964,"And if you don't know what to say, don't say anything."
01:29:50.134,01:29:52.553,-Let's hear it. -What if we stayed?
01:29:53.638,01:29:54.514,Here.
01:29:55.348,01:29:57.809,I'm sure Peter would be glad of the company.
01:29:58.392,01:29:59.977,We could build onto this place.
01:30:00.061,01:30:04.065,We could put another room on the kitchen. Or we could build a place of our own.
01:30:05.358,01:30:08.820,You hold the boards while I hammer in the nails. That it?
01:30:08.903,01:30:10.738,You said you'd let me finish.
01:30:12.657,01:30:14.951,You're finished now. You just don't know it.
01:30:15.701,01:30:22.083,You really want us to live out here in the middle of nowhere with a… Indian boy and a lost horse?
01:30:23.084,01:30:28.381,"Just so you can, what, drive into town every now and again, try and catch a peek at Jimmy?"
01:30:30.550,01:30:39.433,You'll follow him to school and hope time untwists a sour mind and Blanche Weboy lets you hold him again for longer than 30 seconds' time?
01:30:41.144,01:30:52.238,"When they come again… hack off another couple pieces… or they start taking pieces of you, if there's anything left once you're done tearing yourself apart?"
01:30:52.321,01:30:53.573,What then?
01:30:54.574,01:30:57.618,"And when they hurt Jimmy? And they will, just for spite."
01:30:59.162,01:31:00.621,How you gonna feel then?
01:31:04.584,01:31:11.966,"First time I held him, he arranged himself just right in my arms and snug to me."
01:31:12.758,01:31:16.596,"And light as can be, like feathers-- Jesus Christ, Margaret!"
01:31:18.639,01:31:21.184,When are you gonna stop torturing yourself?
01:31:30.735,01:31:32.028,I tried.
01:31:33.821,01:31:35.198,I'm sorry.
01:31:38.784,01:31:40.244,"I tried, George."
01:31:40.745,01:31:41.954,I know.
01:31:49.545,01:31:51.339,God help me.
01:31:56.177,01:31:57.220,Shh.
01:32:00.932,01:32:02.225,Hey. Shh.
01:32:03.309,01:32:05.645,We lost them both.
01:32:47.728,01:32:50.398,"If he's going where I think, he'll have to take the road."
01:32:50.481,01:32:55.861,-You're gonna show me a quicker way. -I'm gonna… -I'm not going. -You are.
01:36:19.273,01:36:20.816,Be still.
01:36:21.901,01:36:24.111,Wake her up. Wake her.
01:36:24.945,01:36:27.281,-Lorna. -What?
01:36:29.909,01:36:32.620,You want to go back to Dalton? You and Jimmy?
01:36:33.662,01:36:36.332,You have to decide. Go or stay.
01:36:40.461,01:36:42.796,You don't get to say a goddamn word.
01:36:44.173,01:36:46.383,This is up to her.
01:36:47.343,01:36:49.178,You know what life will be.
01:36:49.261,01:36:50.679,"Here or there, you know."
01:36:51.597,01:36:54.016,This isn't something you need to think on.
01:36:54.099,01:36:55.100,I'll go.
01:36:57.978,01:37:00.940,You know the car. It's at the bottom of the drive.
01:37:01.023,01:37:02.525,The keys are in it.
01:37:02.608,01:37:05.903,Drive straight to the sheriff's office in Bentrock. Ask for Nevelson.
01:37:05.986,01:37:07.821,-Bentrock. -Sheriff Nevelson.
01:37:08.447,01:37:11.283,-He'll sort this out. -Jimmy's things.
01:37:11.367,01:37:13.702,-I need to get… -No. Out now.
01:37:24.797,01:37:26.257,But what about you?
01:37:28.050,01:37:29.385,Just go.
01:37:30.135,01:37:31.262,-No-- -Just go.
01:37:31.345,01:37:33.514,Quiet as you can. Take the front door.
01:37:35.057,01:37:36.517,Then you run like hell.
01:37:50.864,01:37:51.865,Grandpa.
01:38:09.800,01:38:12.636,"Something's burning. Hey, something's burning! Come on!"
01:38:13.512,01:38:15.472,-You leave that stove on? -Mm-mmm.
01:38:28.027,01:38:29.361,What the hell is going on?
01:38:29.445,01:38:32.948,"Bill, the-- the house is on fire."
01:38:33.032,01:38:35.492,Uh… w-we smelled smoke.
01:38:37.453,01:38:39.788,-Hold on. Hold on. -No!
01:38:48.547,01:38:49.548,Help!
01:38:51.925,01:38:54.261,-No! Get your hands off of him! -Don't! Don't!
01:39:18.702,01:39:19.703,Jimmy.
