00:00:58.933,00:01:00.185,That feels good.
00:01:04.397,00:01:06.816,"Okay, you know what? Slow it down, slow it down."
00:01:06.900,00:01:08.777,-Okay. -Slow it down.
00:01:09.444,00:01:10.612,-There we go. -How's that?
00:01:10.695,00:01:14.532,"That's good, nice and slow. See? Doesn't that feel good?"
00:01:14.616,00:01:15.825,"-Yeah. -No, I want to go fast."
00:01:15.909,00:01:17.744,-You want to go fast? -Fast.
00:01:21.122,00:01:22.499,Yeah. No...
00:01:22.582,00:01:23.917,"Oh, yeah. That feels good."
00:01:24.000,00:01:25.335,"Oh, yeah."
00:01:25.418,00:01:26.586,Yeah.
00:01:28.505,00:01:30.173,Okay. You know what? I think...
00:01:30.256,00:01:32.091,I think maybe we're on different rhythms here.
00:02:18.972,00:02:21.850,I was having a nightmare. I was so scared.
00:02:23.351,00:02:24.310,Good morning.
00:02:24.394,00:02:25.395,Good morning.
00:02:26.312,00:02:28.982,You look beautiful.
00:02:29.065,00:02:30.441,"No, I'm sure I look terrible."
00:02:30.525,00:02:32.443,I just woke up. Are you kidding?
00:02:32.527,00:02:34.320,I'm sure I'm a mess.
00:02:35.530,00:02:36.573,You slept over.
00:02:36.656,00:02:38.324,I did.
00:02:38.408,00:02:41.035,I thought we had a rule against that.
00:02:41.202,00:02:42.203,Oh.
00:02:44.372,00:02:45.498,-That was funny. -I'm kidding.
00:02:45.707,00:02:47.417,You're funny in the morning.
00:02:47.542,00:02:49.168,-I like hanging out with you. -Oh. Yeah.
00:02:49.252,00:02:56.551,I love hanging out with you. I think we get along really well and you're so sexy.
00:02:56.801,00:02:58.261,I know.
00:02:59.554,00:03:06.561,I just have a lot coming up at work and I don't want to make promises I can't keep.
00:03:06.644,00:03:08.271,-You know what I mean? -Mmm-hmm.
00:03:08.354,00:03:10.356,-I know you do. -Yeah. We're on the same page.
00:03:10.481,00:03:13.484,"I'm not looking for a relationship right now, either. Let's just say that."
00:03:13.610,00:03:16.446,Whatever you wanna... I can do...
00:03:16.529,00:03:20.450,I'd rather just... I like simple... I'm not like other girls.
00:03:20.533,00:03:23.661,"I'm not like, Be my boyfriend! Unless you were like, Yeah!"
00:03:26.247,00:03:28.124,Mmm. But let's not.
00:03:28.207,00:03:30.251,I don't want that either. I don't either.
00:03:41.471,00:03:45.934,"Wow, this is so awkward. I really want you to leave, but I don't know how to say it without sounding like a dick."
00:03:46.059,00:03:47.560,Oh...
00:04:46.536,00:04:48.871,Come on! Hands behind your heads! Let's go! Sit-ups!
00:04:49.622,00:04:52.709,You're looking like pieces of bacon on a plate.
00:04:52.792,00:04:55.712,It's disgusting! I smell the fat!
00:04:59.716,00:05:00.883,That's true.
00:05:00.967,00:05:02.927,What are you looking at?
00:05:03.469,00:05:04.971,"Oh, shit, he sees us. Oh, God."
00:05:05.179,00:05:06.848,Hey! Hey!
00:05:07.223,00:05:12.979,"If you want to take this class, you're going to have to pay for it like the rest of these bitches!"
00:05:13.104,00:05:16.190,"What, are you dancing? In the park... Dance class?"
00:05:16.357,00:05:19.152,You are not dancing. You are not dancing in the park!
00:05:21.404,00:05:22.447,I'm coming over there.
00:05:24.157,00:05:26.159,"Sorry, Rodney. We're on a budget."
00:05:29.162,00:05:30.496,"Oh, my God!"
00:05:30.747,00:05:33.166,Come on! You fucking freeloaders.
00:05:35.668,00:05:37.336,-We are out of our minds. -I know.
00:05:37.587,00:05:39.630,That's okay. I'm so glad that we got to do this.
00:05:39.714,00:05:41.090,I feel like I haven't seen you in forever.
00:05:41.174,00:05:42.592,Mmm. I've been in Chicago a lot.
00:05:42.800,00:05:44.719,I know. Sleeping at Dougie's house.
00:05:44.802,00:05:46.429,"Well, it's just closer to work."
00:05:46.637,00:05:47.930,How is it going with him anyway?
00:05:49.015,00:05:52.935,"I don't know. I mean, it's fine, but I just feel like he's kind of been distant lately."
00:05:53.019,00:05:54.771,And I don't know...
00:05:55.188,00:05:57.190,He calls me dude a lot.
00:05:57.273,00:05:58.399,That doesn't mean anything.
00:05:58.566,00:05:59.901,I think everything is fine.
00:06:00.026,00:06:03.321,"I don't know. Anyway, what did you do last night?"
00:06:04.197,00:06:05.239,Um...
00:06:05.323,00:06:06.824,What did you do last night?
00:06:09.118,00:06:11.162,You are not telling me something.
00:06:12.914,00:06:14.332,I hung out with Ted for a little bit.
00:06:14.457,00:06:17.251,-I knew it! -We had fun.
00:06:17.835,00:06:19.587,-It was fun. -Here's what I don't like about it.
00:06:19.754,00:06:22.840,"You hate yourself after you see him, every time."
00:06:23.382,00:06:28.346,"And then we go through this, and then you feel like shit, and it's almost like you're doing it because you feel bad about yourself."
00:06:28.763,00:06:32.266,"He called me late, and we hung out."
00:06:32.350,00:06:34.977,It wasn't a big deal. And you know what? It was fun.
00:06:36.145,00:06:37.396,Ew! You had sex with him.
00:06:38.272,00:06:41.609,We had an adult sleepover.
00:06:41.859,00:06:45.363,Ooh. Did you let him sleep over in your mouth?
00:06:47.824,00:06:49.367,-Annie! -I'm sorry!
00:06:49.450,00:06:53.454,-You're unbelievable. -He kept putting it near my face.
00:06:53.746,00:06:54.831,"They do that, don't they?"
00:06:54.914,00:06:56.207,Why do they do that? Let us offer.
00:06:56.290,00:06:57.291,If we don't offer...
00:06:57.375,00:06:58.376,Please. You're supposed to slap it away.
00:06:58.709,00:06:59.710,I couldn't.
00:07:02.255,00:07:03.798,You don't want to look right at it.
00:07:03.881,00:07:04.966,No.
00:07:05.049,00:07:07.927,It's too aggressive. It's like...
00:07:08.010,00:07:09.387,Hello.
00:07:09.470,00:07:10.513,That's my impression.
00:07:10.596,00:07:11.597,Those are the balls?
00:07:11.681,00:07:14.559,"Yeah. I'm trying to make it round, but I can't because I have elbows."
00:07:17.562,00:07:18.604,"He is so hot, though."
00:07:18.729,00:07:24.944,"Look, I know you say he's cute and all that stuff, but it makes you feel like shit, you know?"
00:07:25.027,00:07:29.157,"You're a total catch, and any guy would be psyched to be your man."
00:07:29.323,00:07:34.120,You should just make room for somebody who is nice to you.
00:07:34.203,00:07:36.247,You know what? He's honest!
00:07:36.330,00:07:40.042,He told me that we are what we are and we're just having fun. And I like that.
00:07:40.126,00:07:43.254,He also told you you need dental work. He's an asshole.
00:07:45.631,00:07:49.135,I don't need dental work.
00:07:49.302,00:07:50.303,You're right.
00:07:50.386,00:07:52.096,There is nothing wrong with my teeth.
00:07:52.180,00:07:54.098,You are so beautiful.
00:07:54.390,00:07:56.392,-Will you marry me? -Yes.
00:07:59.437,00:08:00.438,I love you.
00:08:00.521,00:08:01.522,I love you.
00:08:01.939,00:08:05.067,-I don't want to go to work today. -Mmm-mmm.
00:08:05.568,00:08:07.653,Let's see how many times Terry's called me.
00:08:07.737,00:08:08.738,Oh! Only 15!
00:08:08.821,00:08:12.783,"You know what, Terry? I don't want to pick up your monkey lamps. Sorry!"
00:08:12.867,00:08:14.410,Monkey lamps?
00:08:14.619,00:08:17.497,Ugh. I cannot wait to never work for a psychopath again.
00:08:18.664,00:08:19.749,Oh! Annie!
00:08:19.916,00:08:22.877,I'm sorry. I should have gone down Mason.
00:08:27.465,00:08:29.050,"They were good cakes, Annie."
00:08:29.133,00:08:30.468,Thank you.
00:08:31.135,00:08:33.387,"Come on. Look away, look away, look away."
00:08:37.308,00:08:39.477,Do you have any ideas of styles?
00:08:39.560,00:08:40.978,"Oh, I don't know. What do you think, honey?"
00:08:41.062,00:08:42.230,Whatever you want.
00:08:42.396,00:08:44.357,Look at how you guys are making this decision together.
00:08:44.732,00:08:46.567,"That's sweet. You guys love each other, huh?"
00:08:46.651,00:08:48.152,-Yeah. -Yeah.
00:08:48.444,00:08:50.780,Oh! That's sweet. That will go away.
00:08:58.955,00:09:00.790,Especially someone you're in a relationship with.
00:09:01.082,00:09:03.251,"'Cause they're living with you, you don't know who you're sleeping next to."
00:09:03.334,00:09:04.168,It is scary.
00:09:04.252,00:09:07.380,"I mean, look at him. He may not even be Asian."
00:09:08.256,00:09:09.674,It is scary.
00:09:11.968,00:09:14.595,"So did you guys want to look at, um, these engagement rings?"
00:09:15.221,00:09:17.098,"-We're going to browse. -Okay, sure."
00:09:17.181,00:09:18.391,I'll be here.
00:09:22.270,00:09:23.604,Thank you.
00:09:24.564,00:09:25.565,What was that about?
00:09:26.732,00:09:29.402,"Um, nothing. They had to run. They had to go somewhere."
00:09:29.485,00:09:31.654,And no wonder. You're selling lifelong happiness.
00:09:31.779,00:09:37.118,"You're not telling everyone about your problems and how your boyfriend left you, and maybe marriage will work out."
00:09:37.368,00:09:39.787,Show me your love is eternal face.
00:09:42.206,00:09:45.710,"No, that's two years, four years tops. That is not eternal."
00:09:45.918,00:09:48.170,"Kahlua, can you come over here for a second, please?"
00:09:48.462,00:09:50.214,"What's up, Don-Don?"
00:09:50.548,00:09:52.717,You make up the best nicknames.
00:09:52.842,00:09:55.595,You don't need a nickname because Kahlua is so delicious.
00:09:55.761,00:09:56.929,Don't sue me for touching you.
00:09:57.805,00:10:00.516,Show Annie your love is eternal face.
00:10:07.481,00:10:09.650,That looks like you have menstrual cramps.
00:10:10.318,00:10:11.360,"Thank you so much, Kahlua."
00:10:15.364,00:10:16.991,"Now, why can't you be more like Kahlua?"
00:10:17.158,00:10:18.200,"Look, I'm trying really hard."
00:10:18.326,00:10:19.368,You've just got to try harder.
00:10:19.452,00:10:24.457,"The whole reason you've got this job, Annie, is because your mom is my sponsor in AA, and I'm doing her a favor."
00:10:24.540,00:10:25.541,I understand.
00:10:27.001,00:10:29.003,"Oscar, get back to work."
00:10:31.589,00:10:32.798,You shouldn't be behind the counter.
00:10:44.143,00:10:45.853,That's great. Yeah.
00:10:48.522,00:10:49.523,Stop that. Don't do that.
00:10:52.568,00:10:53.861,"Hey, Brynn."
00:10:53.944,00:10:55.363,"Oh, hey, roomie."
00:10:55.988,00:10:57.907,-Guess what happened to me today. -Hmm. What?
00:10:58.616,00:11:00.576,-I got a free tattoo. -You did what?
00:11:00.660,00:11:03.079,"I could not believe it. The guy said, Do you want a tattoo?"
00:11:03.204,00:11:04.205,Just a random...
00:11:04.288,00:11:05.956,"-Yeah, opened up the side of his van. -No."
00:11:06.040,00:11:08.751,"He said, It's for free! And I said, Sure."
00:11:08.959,00:11:09.960,-You said yes? -Yeah!
00:11:10.044,00:11:12.463,Yeah. Look. See here?
00:11:12.546,00:11:13.923,What is it?
00:11:14.715,00:11:16.092,See that?
00:11:16.634,00:11:18.844,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Brynn!"
00:11:18.928,00:11:21.138,It's a Mexican drinking worm.
00:11:21.222,00:11:24.433,It's a Native American symbol meaning wasted.
00:11:24.517,00:11:26.519,"Okay, Brynn, just so you know, it's..."
00:11:26.602,00:11:28.229,"-Gil, hi. -Hello. How are you?"
00:11:28.312,00:11:30.981,Have you seen your sister's tattoo? It's really infected.
00:11:31.065,00:11:32.191,Better get a little bit of ice on it.
00:11:32.274,00:11:33.401,"Yeah, a little bit."
00:11:33.484,00:11:34.902,-Bit of ice. -Stick some frozen peas on there.
00:11:34.985,00:11:37.029,-Yeah. It can't hurt. -All right.
00:11:37.113,00:11:39.407,"So, I just wanted a quick word."
00:11:39.990,00:11:42.284,You know that tomorrow the rent is due.
00:11:42.368,00:11:44.870,"I was getting my check, and I wondered if I could get your check, too?"
00:11:45.121,00:11:47.248,Yes. I'm getting the money.
00:11:47.331,00:11:50.042,It's been a little slow.
00:11:52.336,00:11:55.881,You have to keep it in the bag and put the bag on it.
00:12:01.470,00:12:03.597,"So, the check?"
00:12:03.931,00:12:05.808,-Yes. Yes. -Yeah.
00:12:05.933,00:12:09.311,"Because it's a kind of, like, needing it today-type situation."
00:12:09.812,00:12:10.896,It's coming.
00:12:14.191,00:12:15.234,Who is it?
00:12:15.317,00:12:18.779,"Oh, my God. Hurry up, your creepy neighbor asked me if I wanted to watch the news again."
00:12:18.946,00:12:20.531,Sorry. He is so gross.
00:12:23.159,00:12:26.287,Welcome to the magazine and wine party. Ooh!
00:12:26.620,00:12:28.080,Have a seat.
00:12:28.164,00:12:30.416,I'm very happy that you are here.
00:12:30.499,00:12:33.502,-What? -Because I want to eat an apple.
00:12:33.794,00:12:36.172,Would you like some apple?
00:12:38.382,00:12:40.593,-What is that? -I got engaged.
00:12:40.843,00:12:42.136,-What? -He asked me last night.
00:12:42.219,00:12:43.888,-What? -I know!
00:12:44.054,00:12:47.933,"That's why he's been acting so weird 'cause he's a terrible liar, and he thought he was gonna blow it."
00:12:48.017,00:12:50.227,He was ignoring me and I thought he was going to break up with me.
00:12:50.311,00:12:51.479,"Oh, my gosh."
00:12:53.564,00:12:54.690,"Oh, my gosh!"
00:12:54.773,00:12:55.774,I know!
00:12:55.858,00:12:56.859,Lil!
00:12:56.942,00:12:58.861,"I'm shocked, still."
00:12:59.111,00:13:00.488,But I'm happy. Can you believe this?
00:13:00.571,00:13:03.574,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I just got hot."
00:13:03.657,00:13:04.700,You did? Are you okay?
00:13:04.783,00:13:05.784,Yes. My pits are sweating.
00:13:05.868,00:13:07.495,-My stomach hurts. I'm hot. -What does that mean?
00:13:10.831,00:13:12.958,I don't know. I'm wearing a ring.
00:13:13.167,00:13:14.335,I can't believe it.
00:13:14.543,00:13:15.753,"Lil, you're getting married."
00:13:16.170,00:13:17.421,I'm getting married.
00:13:17.588,00:13:19.590,And you'll be my maid of honor.
00:13:20.007,00:13:22.426,"God, of course I will!"
00:13:22.510,00:13:23.886,-It will be super fun. -It's gonna be really fun.
00:13:23.969,00:13:26.013,"Yeah. You know, we can plan everything together."
00:13:26.096,00:13:28.641,My God! Planning your wedding...
00:13:28.724,00:13:29.934,Are you sure you're up for it?
00:13:30.017,00:13:32.353,I know it's a lot to ask and to put on your plate.
00:13:32.436,00:13:35.397,"And you're going through a tricky time, and you're super-busy..."
00:13:35.481,00:13:37.024,-Stop. -It's a lot to ask.
00:13:37.107,00:13:38.150,-Stop. -Okay.
00:13:38.234,00:13:41.987,"It's fine. And I'm more than happy to do it, and it's not too much."
00:13:43.280,00:13:45.449,Oh! Look at that. It's my fiancé calling.
00:13:45.574,00:13:46.992,"Oh, your fiancé."
00:13:47.076,00:13:48.285,"Hi, baby, what's up?"
00:13:49.828,00:13:52.540,"It's Annie. I just told her! Yeah, she's so happy."
00:13:52.623,00:13:54.250,"No, I'm not!"
00:13:55.292,00:13:56.585,"Yay, she said."
00:13:58.045,00:13:59.547,"What, baby?"
00:13:59.922,00:14:01.924,"I know, I miss you, too."
00:14:03.300,00:14:05.594,"Yeah, I'll meet you in an hour."
00:14:06.262,00:14:07.638,"I love you, too."
00:14:33.122,00:14:34.582,Wynonna Judd.
00:14:35.124,00:14:36.709,That's really good.
00:14:36.792,00:14:40.212,Painting those giant bangs was a royal pain in my can.
00:14:40.296,00:14:43.382,And those teeth! I should have painted her mouth shut.
00:14:43.465,00:14:45.801,Can you just get dressed? We're gonna be late for the engagement party.
00:14:45.926,00:14:47.136,"-Oh, I forgot to tell you, honey. -What?"
00:14:47.219,00:14:48.387,-Forgot to tell you. -What?
00:14:48.470,00:14:52.182,"I signed up to speak at AA tonight, and I just have to."
00:14:52.308,00:14:53.517,-Mom! -No.
00:14:53.601,00:14:56.103,"I forgot. I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry."
00:14:56.228,00:14:58.689,"I keep telling you, you're not supposed to go to those things."
00:14:58.772,00:15:00.232,You're not an alcoholic.
00:15:00.316,00:15:02.109,Only because I've never had a drink.
00:15:02.693,00:15:05.154,-What? -They are inspiring.
00:15:05.279,00:15:07.281,There is this one story I've just got to tell you.
00:15:07.364,00:15:08.407,-Sit down. -Okay.
00:15:08.490,00:15:14.079,This gentleman who started blow-jobbing to get crack. His name is Marvin Johnson...
00:15:14.204,00:15:17.833,"-Mom, anonymous. You keep... No names. -Okay, okay."
00:15:18.083,00:15:20.210,Forget it. Marvin J. Whatever.
00:15:20.336,00:15:22.713,"-Too late. -Well, he became a gay prostitute."
00:15:22.796,00:15:25.132,And he realized that he had hit his bottom.
00:15:25.257,00:15:30.804,"And I have been thinking, honey, that maybe this is your bottom."
00:15:30.930,00:15:34.683,"I'm telling you, hitting bottom is a good thing."
00:15:38.604,00:15:40.022,-Right? -Yep. That's what you say.
00:15:40.189,00:15:42.191,"-Yeah, a positive message. -Yeah."
00:15:42.608,00:15:44.443,"Yeah. Thanks for the pep talk, Mom."
00:15:44.526,00:15:46.528,"Honey. Anytime, anytime."
00:15:46.654,00:15:49.406,"All right. I guess I'm going to Lillian's party by myself, then."
00:15:49.740,00:15:51.742,Don't talk to me about being by yourself.
00:15:51.825,00:15:53.577,I go everywhere by myself.
00:15:53.661,00:15:56.080,"Well, you know, thanks to that new whore, Barb."
00:15:56.163,00:15:57.957,"-Mom, come on. -No, I don't like to say it."
00:15:58.040,00:15:59.458,They've been married 12 years.
00:15:59.541,00:16:01.335,Okay. But she's still a whore.
00:16:01.418,00:16:05.297,"I'm sure she greets him in the evening, beaver first."
00:16:06.882,00:16:07.967,I don't want to think about that.
00:16:08.133,00:16:09.510,You sure you don't want to move in with me?
00:16:10.177,00:16:12.846,"Mom, thanks, but no way."
00:16:13.055,00:16:14.390,-No way in hell. -Yeah?
00:16:14.473,00:16:15.474,"No, thanks."
00:16:15.891,00:16:16.934,-Think about it. -Okay.
00:16:17.059,00:16:18.185,You don't need your own place.
00:16:18.310,00:16:20.270,"-Yeah, I kind of do. -Okay."
00:16:20.729,00:16:21.730,"-All right, I'm going to go. -All right."
00:16:43.669,00:16:45.129,Holy shit.
00:16:47.756,00:16:49.466,Oh. Valet. Perfect.
00:16:53.137,00:16:55.097,Sorry. Needs a wash.
00:17:01.937,00:17:03.355,You have to punch it a few times.
00:17:17.286,00:17:18.454,Annie!
00:17:19.121,00:17:20.497,"Oh, my God!"
00:17:21.123,00:17:23.333,"-Oh, my God, Lillian. -I know."
00:17:23.542,00:17:25.586,-This is your engagement party. -Isn't that crazy?
00:17:25.961,00:17:27.421,It's so beautiful.
00:17:27.504,00:17:29.506,I can't believe Dougie's boss is a member here.
00:17:29.590,00:17:33.135,"I know, and his parents, too. And Dougie, I guess."
00:17:33.469,00:17:35.345,"Gosh, and me, I guess, too, now."
00:17:35.846,00:17:38.307,"Come on, let's go say hi to the rest of the bridal party!"
00:17:38.849,00:17:40.976,You remember my cousin Rita?
00:17:41.435,00:17:43.312,-Rita. -Annie.
00:17:43.729,00:17:47.274,I haven't seen you since you graduated high school.
00:17:47.399,00:17:48.567,She has three kids now.
00:17:50.903,00:17:54.948,"They are cute, but when they reach that age, they are disgusting."
00:17:55.032,00:18:02.664,"They smell, they're sticky, they say things that are horrible, and there is semen all over everything, okay?"
00:18:02.790,00:18:03.874,Disgusting.
00:18:04.083,00:18:06.043,I cracked a blanket in half.
00:18:06.210,00:18:07.628,Do you get where I'm going with that?
00:18:07.711,00:18:09.671,"-I do, yeah. -I cracked it in half."
00:18:09.755,00:18:10.714,What?
00:18:13.467,00:18:14.510,We are in the trenches together.
00:18:16.178,00:18:17.179,Nice to meet you.
00:18:17.262,00:18:18.430,"This is my husband, Kevin."
00:18:18.514,00:18:19.723,-Hi. -Husband.
00:18:19.807,00:18:21.058,I like to say it. We are newlyweds.
00:18:21.141,00:18:22.351,Wow. Congratulations.
00:18:22.434,00:18:23.560,Thank you so much.
00:18:23.977,00:18:26.355,-We went on a sweetheart honeymoon. -Oh.
00:18:29.983,00:18:31.610,We finish each other's sentences. Sorry.
00:18:35.948,00:18:37.199,Sorry. Is this your husband?
00:18:39.034,00:18:40.953,"No, no, no, no, no."
00:18:41.036,00:18:42.746,I don't know him. I'm sorry.
00:18:42.955,00:18:45.124,Do you want to go for a walk later?
00:18:45.207,00:18:46.542,Oh. I can't.
00:18:47.668,00:18:49.419,-All right. -I can't. I'm sorry.
00:18:49.878,00:18:50.921,I'm so sorry.
00:18:51.004,00:18:53.090,I'm not with anybody. I'm here solo.
00:18:53.966,00:18:57.177,-Let's start it again. I'm Becca. -Rewind.
00:18:57.261,00:19:00.264,This is my husband. You don't have a husband.
00:19:01.223,00:19:02.391,Sorry.
00:19:02.474,00:19:05.310,"And this is Dougie's sister, Megan."
00:19:07.521,00:19:09.898,My grandma is not supposed to have wine. I'll be right back.
00:19:12.651,00:19:14.111,-Hey. -Hey. How is it going?
00:19:14.194,00:19:16.905,It's going great. It's going great. I'm on the mend.
00:19:16.989,00:19:19.158,I just got some pins in my legs.
00:19:19.408,00:19:23.245,"Believe it or not, pins in my legs, I can still do this. Right?"
00:19:23.328,00:19:25.831,"I fell off a cruise ship, but I'm back."
00:19:25.914,00:19:27.499,"-Oh, shit. -Yeah, Oh, shit."
00:19:27.958,00:19:29.126,"Yeah, Oh, shit."
00:19:29.835,00:19:33.672,"Took a hard, hard, violent fall. Kind of pinballed down."
00:19:33.755,00:19:35.966,"Hit a lot of railings, broke a lot of shit."
00:19:36.133,00:19:39.052,"I'm not going to say I survived, I'm going to say I thrived."
00:19:39.469,00:19:41.305,I met a dolphin down there.
00:19:41.388,00:19:45.726,"And I swear to God, that dolphin looked not at me, but into my soul."
00:19:45.809,00:19:47.519,"Into my goddamn soul, Annie."
00:19:47.728,00:19:50.189,"And he said, I'm saving you, Megan."
00:19:50.689,00:19:54.985,"Not with his mouth, but he said it, I'm assuming, telepathically."
00:19:55.110,00:19:59.448,We had a connection that I don't even know if I can... Jesus.
00:20:01.325,00:20:04.286,"Hey, shut my mouth. Look at... Unbelievable."
00:20:04.369,00:20:05.746,You must be Annie's fella.
00:20:06.246,00:20:07.831,I'm Megan. It's a pleasure.
00:20:08.165,00:20:11.043,He's not... I'm not... He's not... I'm not with him.
00:20:11.126,00:20:12.502,-Sorry. -All right.
00:20:13.045,00:20:15.964,"I'm glad he's single, because I'm going to climb that like a tree."
00:20:17.174,00:20:19.843,Okay. You have to meet Helen.
00:20:19.927,00:20:21.595,There she is. Helen.
00:20:31.688,00:20:33.023,"Helen, this is Annie."
00:20:33.106,00:20:34.107,-Hi! -Oh!
00:20:34.233,00:20:37.069,There she is. Maid of honor.
00:20:37.152,00:20:40.489,So lovely to meet Lillian's childhood friend.
00:20:41.448,00:20:43.116,You are so pretty.
00:20:43.200,00:20:46.495,"You are so cute! Aw, you're so sweet."
00:20:46.870,00:20:51.291,"Helen is married to Dougie's boss, Mr. Harris. Perry."
00:20:51.375,00:20:55.128,"Perry. And they are so close now, they are literally joined at the hip."
00:20:55.254,00:20:57.089,"Which is good, because so are we."
00:20:57.172,00:21:00.384,I know. I'm so glad you guys are finally meeting.
00:21:00.467,00:21:02.469,"-I know. Me, too. -I know. It's lovely."
00:21:03.011,00:21:05.138,"Well, excuse me, I better go check on the hors d'oeuvres."
00:21:05.222,00:21:06.974,But it was great to finally meet you.
00:21:07.057,00:21:08.558,It's a great party.
00:21:14.856,00:21:16.066,"She's great, isn't she?"
00:21:16.149,00:21:17.651,She's awesome.
00:21:22.698,00:21:26.410,So much so that you two should get married right now and save me a shitload of money.
00:21:28.537,00:21:31.873,"Everybody always laughs at that, but I'm not joking."
00:21:34.459,00:21:35.502,I'm not joking.
00:21:36.712,00:21:40.215,"Anyway, I want to thank all of you for coming."
00:21:40.299,00:21:43.260,"And here's to Doug and my baby girl, Lillian."
00:21:43.343,00:21:45.137,-Cheers! -Cheers!
00:21:46.930,00:21:48.598,Let's get the maid of honor up here.
00:21:49.016,00:21:50.726,-Annie? -All right.
00:21:53.520,00:21:55.605,Um. Hi. I'm Annie Walker.
00:21:55.731,00:21:56.898,"Yay, Annie!"
00:21:59.151,00:22:03.113,"I'm not going to go on with a big speech, so I'll just say this."
00:22:04.114,00:22:06.992,I'm so happy to be a part of this celebration.
00:22:07.075,00:22:10.746,"And you two deserve each other, as well as a lifetime of happiness."
00:22:14.166,00:22:15.584,"-Thanks, Annie. -Cheers."
00:22:18.420,00:22:20.797,"Thank you, Annie. That was so sweet. Thank you."
00:22:21.131,00:22:25.135,"Lil, remember that trip we took to Miami with the boys?"
00:22:26.219,00:22:30.640,"And they were working the entire weekend, and we just sat and drank wine and ate peanut brittle."
00:22:30.766,00:22:34.895,And I shared things with you that I've never shared with anyone.
00:22:34.978,00:22:39.983,And you made me realize how I can trust people again.
00:22:40.442,00:22:45.280,"So let me just say, Lillian, you are my best friend."
00:22:50.077,00:22:53.163,"Sorry. And, Dougly..."
00:22:53.246,00:22:55.165,"I'm sorry, inside joke."
00:22:57.959,00:23:04.216,"You better not keep my Lil on a leash because I still need my drunken Saturday nights at Rockin' Sushi, okay?"
00:23:05.801,00:23:12.265,"Everybody raise your glasses to the couple of the decade, Doug and Lillian."
00:23:19.022,00:23:21.316,Have a great night. Dessert wine is out.
00:23:21.399,00:23:23.902,"Dessert wine, yummy. Excuse me."
00:23:25.070,00:23:26.071,Um...
00:23:29.407,00:23:32.953,"You're so special to me, because..."
00:23:33.036,00:23:35.997,"Well, one of the reasons is because I've known you my whole entire life."
00:23:36.748,00:23:40.085,And you've really helped shape who I am.
00:23:40.377,00:23:46.341,I just want to thank you for carefully selecting me as your maid of honor.
00:23:46.424,00:23:52.764,"I know you had some other choices, but you are like my sister, and I love you."
00:23:52.973,00:23:55.517,"Well, that concludes the speeches for the night."
00:23:55.976,00:23:57.727,Thank you. One last thing.
00:23:57.811,00:24:02.274,"It's rare to meet someone as an adult who you really connect with, and that's you, Lil."
00:24:02.649,00:24:08.446,"I went to Thailand recently with my husband, Perry, and there is a beautiful saying that I learned there."
00:24:16.538,00:24:24.921,"It means, You are a part of me, a part that I could never live without, and I hope and I pray that I never have to."
00:24:31.136,00:24:33.096,And that's it for tonight. Thank you for coming.
00:24:33.305,00:24:36.224,"-Thank you all for coming. -Really quick, I just wanted to say really quick..."
00:24:36.349,00:24:37.976,Dessert wine is out. Consuelo?
00:24:38.059,00:24:43.815,"Really quick. Speaking of Consuelo, Lillian and I took Spanish together in school."
00:24:44.316,00:24:47.736,"And so, I would just like to say to you, and to everyone here..."
00:25:09.883,00:25:11.593,Thank you.
00:25:11.676,00:25:14.596,Thank you. I feel so close to you and can trust you.
00:25:14.679,00:25:16.973,You are my angel and soul mate.
00:25:17.057,00:25:22.187,And I feel I can communicate with you with simply a look.
00:25:25.190,00:25:27.108,Thank you for coming.
00:25:27.192,00:25:29.653,"Here, I'll take that. I'll take that."
00:25:31.196,00:25:32.781,"Yep, I got it."
00:25:34.199,00:25:35.867,Lillian...
00:26:24.833,00:26:29.296,"It made me feel awesome, like I can go out and catch another dude to marry."
00:26:32.257,00:26:35.135,"So, what's up with her, anyway? With Helen?"
00:26:36.094,00:26:37.512,-What? -I'm just like...
00:26:37.846,00:26:41.599,"I don't know. She's in your wedding and you've only known her, like, eight months, though, right?"
00:26:41.850,00:26:43.601,"-Come on. -Get it out, get it all out."
00:26:49.482,00:26:51.359,"-It's just weird, right? -You know what?"
00:26:51.443,00:26:53.778,"She's actually really cool, Annie."
00:26:53.862,00:26:56.197,She's really... She's a good one. I'm telling you.
00:26:56.531,00:26:59.617,"Well, I'm sure if you like her, I will like her."
00:27:00.118,00:27:02.203,You have to just get to know her.
00:27:02.287,00:27:04.039,-Yeah. -Which I think you really should.
00:27:04.122,00:27:05.999,And... Will you just do me a favor?
00:27:06.082,00:27:09.210,"Would you just hang out with her once, just the two of you. All right?"
00:27:09.294,00:27:10.879,As a favor to me.
00:27:10.962,00:27:12.130,"Okay, I will."
00:27:12.797,00:27:14.382,"-I love you, Annie Lou. -I love you, too."
00:27:14.466,00:27:15.467,-Bye. -Bye.
00:27:17.969,00:27:20.805,"You live in Milwaukee? Oh, I'm sorry."
00:27:21.014,00:27:23.391,Have you met Lillian? She's my best friend.
00:27:23.475,00:27:25.352,"Yeah, I know. We've only known each other for five minutes."
00:27:25.602,00:27:26.728,Oh! Oh!
00:27:32.525,00:27:33.651,Oh! Cute.
00:27:34.611,00:27:37.155,No. No. Come on.
00:27:42.327,00:27:46.039,See? Okay? I'm not drunk. I told you.
00:27:46.498,00:27:48.333,"So, you are just a terrible sober driver?"
00:27:48.416,00:27:50.668,Ha ha. Very funny. Can I stop walking now?
00:27:50.794,00:27:52.712,You can stop walking when I tell you to stop walking.
00:27:52.796,00:27:55.965,"Hey, look. If I was drunk, would I be able to do this?"
00:28:14.192,00:28:16.945,"Stop it. Stop it. Please, stop."
00:28:17.028,00:28:18.738,"Please, stop. I believe you. You are not drunk."
00:28:19.197,00:28:20.573,But I'm still gonna have to give you a ticket.
00:28:20.865,00:28:22.158,What? Why?
00:28:22.242,00:28:25.370,It's a funny thing about brake lights. You have to have them.
00:28:25.703,00:28:28.498,"I knew it. God, those have been out for a year."
00:28:28.665,00:28:30.291,I'm so stupid.
00:28:30.375,00:28:31.626,"Look, please."
00:28:32.377,00:28:34.003,"Please, I promise I will get them fixed."
00:28:34.170,00:28:38.675,"This week, I promise. Please. Do you have to give me a ticket?"
00:28:41.094,00:28:43.263,"Yes. License and registration, please."
00:28:50.729,00:28:51.896,Thanks.
00:28:53.690,00:28:56.067,"Look at that, you live on Wynnewood Drive."
00:28:56.151,00:28:57.527,-Yep. -We're neighbors.
00:28:57.986,00:29:00.071,-I just live over on Ashley. -Ah.
00:29:02.115,00:29:03.450,I used to work on Ashley.
00:29:03.533,00:29:05.660,You did? Where?
00:29:05.744,00:29:10.582,I had a bakery on the main part of the street there.
00:29:11.916,00:29:13.710,Oh. Cake Baby.
00:29:15.920,00:29:17.547,-You are Cake Baby! -Yeah!
00:29:17.922,00:29:20.592,"Yeah, you had your sign. It was your face."
00:29:21.259,00:29:22.510,-Yeah! -That was you?
00:29:22.594,00:29:23.636,That was me.
00:29:24.763,00:29:26.055,You made good cakes.
00:29:27.807,00:29:28.850,Thanks.
00:29:28.933,00:29:35.899,"You used to make these little pastry things, and you'd put something in them, like a cream or a custard..."
00:29:36.274,00:29:37.317,Cream puffs.
00:29:37.400,00:29:39.694,"Cream puffs, that's what you call them. Delicious."
00:29:40.779,00:29:45.992,"I used to get served by this tall, broad guy, with, like, a wormy face."
00:29:46.618,00:29:48.787,"Yeah, that was my boyfriend."
00:29:50.830,00:29:52.373,"-Sorry. -No, no. It was..."
00:29:52.457,00:29:59.464,"He was my boyfriend, and then he left me when the business went under. So, anyway..."
00:29:59.547,00:30:01.090,You're kidding?
00:30:02.425,00:30:03.802,What a dick.
00:30:05.011,00:30:06.971,I'm glad I never tipped him.
00:30:12.227,00:30:13.478,You know what? Let's forget about this.
00:30:14.437,00:30:16.272,-Let's just forget this one. -Really?
00:30:16.356,00:30:18.024,-Under one condition. -What? What?
00:30:18.107,00:30:19.234,Get your taillights fixed...
00:30:19.317,00:30:21.194,I promise. I promise I will. I promise. Thank you.
00:30:21.277,00:30:22.403,...before you kill someone.
00:30:22.529,00:30:23.655,I'm not going to kill anybody.
00:30:23.738,00:30:25.198,"All right. Here, there's your ID."
00:30:25.323,00:30:26.783,And I'm going to give you this.
00:30:26.866,00:30:29.494,It's a buddy of mine. He has a body shop in Milwaukee.
00:30:29.577,00:30:31.287,He'll fix those right up for you.
00:30:32.038,00:30:33.748,Bill Cozbi?
00:30:33.998,00:30:35.291,"Yeah, with a Z."
00:30:35.792,00:30:37.544,-Different guy. -Yeah.
00:30:37.627,00:30:40.004,And don't mention the whole Bill Cosby thing to him.
00:30:40.088,00:30:42.507,It drives him nuts. I mean it.
00:30:42.590,00:30:44.926,"Okay, I get it. Thanks."
00:30:45.009,00:30:49.722,"You know what? If you mention my name, that I referred you, he'll give you a particularly good deal."
00:30:49.806,00:30:51.933,My gosh. Thank you.
00:30:52.016,00:30:54.269,I really appreciate it. Thanks.
00:30:54.352,00:30:56.938,"Okay. Well, I appreciated your cakes."
00:30:57.021,00:30:58.815,"So, we're even."
00:30:58.898,00:31:01.067,"That's me, there. Rhodes. Officer Rhodes."
00:31:01.150,00:31:02.318,That's really nice of you.
00:31:08.241,00:31:09.784,We're not all bad.
00:31:09.868,00:31:11.119,What?
00:31:11.202,00:31:12.579,"I was just saying, we're not all bad!"
00:31:12.829,00:31:14.247,Oh. Yeah.
00:31:14.330,00:31:17.000,"Actually, the rest of them are, but not me."
00:31:17.083,00:31:18.626,I'm the best of them.
00:31:18.710,00:31:20.003,Okay. Thank you.
00:31:20.753,00:31:21.963,Anyway.
00:31:22.422,00:31:23.464,Thank you.
00:33:13.116,00:33:14.492,I didn't know you played tennis.
00:33:14.575,00:33:16.494,"Yeah, I played a little in high school."
00:33:16.703,00:33:18.371,I'm so glad we were able to do this.
00:33:18.621,00:33:20.832,"I'm really glad we could do this, too. It's nice we get to hang out."
00:33:20.915,00:33:22.125,"-I know, right? -Yeah."
00:33:22.208,00:33:24.085,It's too bad Lillian couldn't play with us today.
00:33:24.168,00:33:25.336,"Poor thing, she is so busy."
00:33:25.503,00:33:26.671,Oh. I know.
00:33:26.838,00:33:29.507,But she's not really that into sports.
00:33:29.716,00:33:32.593,"Even when we were little, she didn't like anything that was too competitive."
00:33:32.760,00:33:35.680,She certainly enjoys playing tennis now.
00:33:35.763,00:33:37.515,"It's funny how people change, isn't it?"
00:33:37.598,00:33:40.852,"Yeah. I mean, I don't know. Do people really change?"
00:33:41.519,00:33:42.520,I think they do.
00:33:42.812,00:33:45.898,"Yeah, but, I mean, they still stay who they are, pretty much."
00:33:46.232,00:33:48.526,I think we change all the time.
00:33:49.027,00:33:53.114,"I think we stay the same, but grow, I guess, a little bit."
00:33:53.281,00:33:55.533,"I think if you're growing, then you're changing."
00:33:55.700,00:33:59.078,"But, I mean, we're changing from who we are, which we always stay as."
00:33:59.162,00:34:00.705,"Not really, I don't think so."
00:34:00.830,00:34:02.373,-I think so. -I don't.
00:34:03.666,00:34:05.168,Annie! These are my kids.
00:34:05.251,00:34:07.086,-Step-kids. -Step.
00:34:09.255,00:34:10.298,They are so hilarious.
00:34:10.423,00:34:11.466,Funny.
00:34:11.549,00:34:14.343,"Excuse me, my husband's kids."
00:34:15.970,00:34:17.096,Going to the snack bar.
00:34:17.180,00:34:19.057,Awesome. You need a ride home later?
00:34:19.348,00:34:20.808,"Fuck off, Helen."
00:34:21.225,00:34:24.437,Okay. Put a quarter in the swear-jar.
00:34:24.896,00:34:27.231,Good to see you.
00:34:27.315,00:34:28.357,They're so cute.
00:34:28.483,00:34:29.567,Sweet kids.
00:35:01.724,00:35:02.767,Carol!
00:35:02.975,00:35:04.644,"Get your shit together, Carol!"
00:35:17.490,00:35:18.574,Yes!
00:35:20.618,00:35:24.080,I've seen better tennis playing in a tampon commercial.
00:35:28.835,00:35:29.836,Um...
00:35:30.503,00:35:32.380,"I've been thinking, and..."
00:35:32.630,00:35:35.216,Brynn needs to start paying rent. That's it.
00:35:35.299,00:35:36.634,She's been here long enough.
00:35:36.717,00:35:39.637,"The three of us live here, it's not fair for me to be paying half."
00:35:39.804,00:35:42.306,We split it three ways. What do you say?
00:35:42.390,00:35:44.892,"Well, she can't work. She's on a tourist visa."
00:35:44.976,00:35:47.603,"Yeah. So, technically, I'm only allowed to tour."
00:35:47.687,00:35:48.980,"Well, you know..."
00:35:49.063,00:35:53.151,"I have no way of earning money, unless I just go and prostitute down on the street."
00:35:53.234,00:35:56.821,"-I don't want you to do that, no. -Hello, fellas. Here I am."
00:35:56.904,00:35:59.907,"-Yeah, but we... -Put your American sausage in my English McMuffin."
00:35:59.991,00:36:01.075,"-No, we did that. -All right."
00:36:01.159,00:36:03.536,"Okay, I don't even know what you're talking about anymore."
00:36:03.744,00:36:05.496,-There's three people living here. -Yeah.
00:36:05.580,00:36:07.498,If she doesn't start paying...
00:36:09.041,00:36:10.585,Is this about the diary again?
00:36:10.668,00:36:11.752,What diary?
00:36:12.003,00:36:14.672,Your diary proved very interesting to read.
00:36:14.964,00:36:16.841,You read my... You read my journal?
00:36:16.924,00:36:20.094,"At first, I did not know that it was your diary."
00:36:20.178,00:36:23.264,"I thought it was a very sad, hand-written book."
00:36:24.515,00:36:29.520,"-What? That does not make any... -But, because of the deep personal details and the bits that mentioned Gil and Brynn..."
00:36:32.481,00:36:33.733,-Then... -Don't go in my room!
00:36:33.816,00:36:44.202,"Well, hello! I think, before you make those sort of demands, you need to, maybe, think about putting a note on your door saying, Do not come into my room, read my diary and wear my clothes."
00:36:57.715,00:36:59.759,"Look, you can get your checks cashed next door."
00:36:59.842,00:37:03.721,"I know it looks a little scary on the outside, but the food is really good, authentic Brazilian."
00:37:06.349,00:37:07.683,"I got to say, Annie's really good at this."
00:37:07.767,00:37:11.270,She always drags me to the weirdest places and the food is always incredible.
00:37:11.354,00:37:14.232,"And plus, you get a lot for your money, too. So that's good."
00:37:14.899,00:37:17.652,-All right. Let's do it. -Let's do it.
00:37:17.735,00:37:19.737,Whoa! Somebody likes Brazilian food.
00:37:24.367,00:37:25.493,To my bridesmaids.
00:37:28.079,00:37:29.538,Cheers to Lil!
00:37:29.622,00:37:32.291,"This is such a stone-cold pack of weirdos, and I'm so proud."
00:37:33.751,00:37:35.962,And I just want to toast all of you ladies.
00:37:36.045,00:37:40.633,"I'm so happy to get to know you guys, and happy to say that I have four new friends."
00:37:40.967,00:37:42.510,Absolutely. Cheers.
00:37:45.054,00:37:49.850,I hope that you're all hungry for churrasco Brazil. What would you like?
00:37:50.184,00:37:51.519,"Yeah, I'll have some of that, please."
00:37:51.602,00:37:52.687,I'll start with this.
00:37:52.770,00:37:55.231,"I'd say yes. Hello, chicken."
00:37:55.314,00:37:57.108,"This is crazy good, y'all."
00:37:57.608,00:37:59.110,"Helen, aren't you eating any meat?"
00:37:59.277,00:38:00.319,Oh...
00:38:00.403,00:38:03.572,It's not good to eat a big meal before a fitting.
00:38:03.656,00:38:05.032,"I feel a bit bloated, so..."
00:38:07.368,00:38:08.452,"No. Physically, I don't bloat."
00:38:09.328,00:38:10.663,-Lucky. -That is lucky.
00:38:11.455,00:38:12.748,It's a gift.
00:38:12.915,00:38:16.585,I can't wait to be married for as long as you've been married.
00:38:16.669,00:38:17.837,And to have kids.
00:38:21.048,00:38:22.675,-And be a mom. -Becca?
00:38:22.758,00:38:24.844,Yeah?
00:38:24.927,00:38:29.307,"The other night, I'm slaving away, making a beautiful dinner for my family."
00:38:29.724,00:38:32.810,My youngest boy comes in and says he wants to order a pizza.
00:38:33.019,00:38:34.729,"I said, No, we're not ordering pizza tonight."
00:38:34.812,00:38:37.315,"He goes, Mom, why don't you go and fuck yourself?"
00:38:37.815,00:38:39.150,He's nine.
00:38:40.776,00:38:44.572,"Okay, now that Lillian's in the bathroom, I just wanted to talk to you guys about the shower really quick."
00:38:44.655,00:38:50.703,"I was thinking it could be French-themed, since she's always wanted to go to Paris her whole life."
00:38:50.828,00:38:57.877,-Ooh! -So I figured we could bring Paris here and have champagne and little cookies.
00:38:57.960,00:38:59.462,They'd say Lillian and Dougie on them.
00:38:59.587,00:39:03.841,"We can dip them in chocolate fondue, and get cheese from the nice part of the store."
00:39:04.175,00:39:05.676,"-I love that. -Good idea, Annie."
00:39:05.843,00:39:07.845,"We can have French invitations, the whole thing."
00:39:07.928,00:39:09.055,Don't you think that'd be nice?
00:39:09.138,00:39:11.098,-That's adorable! -That's really cute.
00:39:11.182,00:39:12.892,Good. Great.
00:39:12.975,00:39:14.643,I don't know. It's really cute.
00:39:14.727,00:39:18.898,"But I feel like, personally, the Paris theme's a bit, Been there, done that."
00:39:19.065,00:39:20.358,I just feel like we can top it.
00:39:20.441,00:39:21.776,We should throw some ideas around.
00:39:21.859,00:39:28.074,See if anyone else has a theme they had in mind What about a Pixar-themed shower?
00:39:28.866,00:39:31.035,And we all come dressed as our favorite Pixar character.
00:39:31.202,00:39:35.539,"That, and I'll just snowball on top of that, also Fight Club."
00:39:37.208,00:39:38.250,Female fight club.
00:39:39.377,00:39:41.295,"We grease up, we pull in."
00:39:41.379,00:39:45.049,"Lillian doesn't know, so it's, Surprise! We're going to fight!"
00:39:45.132,00:39:46.759,We beat the shit out of her.
00:39:47.635,00:39:49.220,She's not going to forget that.
00:39:49.470,00:39:51.347,We just fucking attack.
00:39:51.806,00:39:53.599,"-Can I be honest? -Oh, no."
00:39:53.682,00:39:56.852,"I'm at home with three boys all day, every day."
00:39:56.936,00:39:58.270,What about the bachelorette party?
00:39:58.604,00:39:59.772,That's what's more important.
00:40:00.189,00:40:02.358,"I've got a new tube top, I want to cut the tags off."
00:40:02.441,00:40:04.402,I'd like to take advantage of this opportunity.
00:40:06.779,00:40:08.406,-We'd better blow this shit out. -Yeah.
00:40:08.489,00:40:13.619,"That poor girl, Lillian, who we're all here for, is in the bathroom probably bawling her fucking eyes out."
00:40:13.911,00:40:15.788,"Because she's realizing, Holy shit!"
00:40:15.871,00:40:17.623,I've got to spend the rest of my life with Doug.
00:40:17.706,00:40:20.835,He's my brother. I love him. But he is a fucking asshole.
00:40:20.918,00:40:22.670,"I think we can all agree on that, right?"
00:40:24.255,00:40:26.090,We can... We'll figure it out.
00:40:26.173,00:40:28.634,"I mean, I can think of stuff, and it will be great."
00:40:28.717,00:40:30.928,"We just have to make sure it's really, really special."
00:40:34.765,00:40:38.561,"Belle en Blanc? This is the place. Great job, Annie."
00:40:38.644,00:40:40.312,-Thanks. -Annie.
00:40:42.940,00:40:44.775,Belle en Blanc. Reservation name?
00:40:44.859,00:40:48.696,"I don't have one. We're just here to shop, just to try on some dresses."
00:40:48.779,00:40:52.241,"Okay. Well, the next available appointment for bridesmaids' fittings is in seven weeks."
00:40:52.324,00:40:54.160,Absolutely no walk-ins.
00:40:54.285,00:40:56.078,Whitney? It's Helen.
00:40:56.245,00:40:57.830,-Helen Harris? -Yeah!
00:40:57.913,00:40:58.956,-Hi! -Hi.
00:40:59.039,00:41:00.916,"Oh, my God. Hi. Listen, I'll buzz you right in."
00:41:01.000,00:41:02.793,"-Great, thanks. -Okay."
00:41:04.211,00:41:06.672,"Hello. Welcome, come in."
00:41:06.755,00:41:07.882,-You look wonderful. -Great to see you.
00:41:07.965,00:41:09.884,"Welcome to Belle en Blanc, ladies."
00:41:17.266,00:41:18.934,"Jesus, Megan!"
00:41:19.018,00:41:20.519,"I'm sorry, I want to apologize."
00:41:20.603,00:41:23.898,I'm not even confident on which end that came out of.
00:41:23.981,00:41:26.025,"Whitney, back to you. I'm sorry."
00:41:26.108,00:41:29.153,"Anyway, take a look around. Get to know the dresses."
00:41:29.528,00:41:30.988,"If you need anything, I'll be in my office."
00:41:31.489,00:41:32.573,Have fun.
00:41:32.656,00:41:35.493,"Oh, my God."
00:41:35.951,00:41:37.328,It's a Fritz Bernaise.
00:41:37.495,00:41:38.579,"-Ladies, I... -Oh, my God!"
00:41:38.662,00:41:41.081,I just don't think we can do any better. This is...
00:41:41.165,00:41:43.125,-This is beautiful. -That is gorgeous.
00:41:43.209,00:41:44.919,"It's unique, it's special, it's couture."
00:41:45.002,00:41:48.631,"-This is made in France. -Helen, this is, um, $800."
00:41:48.714,00:41:50.466,Are you kidding? It's on sale.
00:41:54.303,00:41:55.679,Oh. That's nice.
00:41:56.347,00:41:59.934,There's other dresses we should be looking at.
00:42:00.017,00:42:01.727,"Nope, not that one."
00:42:03.395,00:42:05.356,"Lillian, Lillian, look at this one."
00:42:05.439,00:42:06.982,-Isn't this pretty? -Yeah.
00:42:07.066,00:42:09.276,"It's really pretty and sweet, and..."
00:42:09.360,00:42:13.531,We don't want to upstage Lillian with a big fancy dress.
00:42:13.614,00:42:15.199,Maybe we should just get something kind of simple.
00:42:15.324,00:42:16.325,Oh.
00:42:16.575,00:42:19.870,Please do not worry about upstaging me.
00:42:19.954,00:42:26.126,Because guess who Helen is friends with and who's designing my wedding dress.
00:42:26.210,00:42:29.004,Lady St. Petsois JuJu.
00:42:29.964,00:42:33.008,"I just sent my measurements to France, y'all."
00:42:35.594,00:42:38.639,"Ladies, let's not decide on this bridesmaids' dress straight away."
00:42:38.722,00:42:40.099,Let's let our bodies decide.
00:42:40.432,00:42:42.768,"Try some things on and have some fun, okay?"
00:42:43.143,00:42:45.062,"Yeah, let's have some fun, girls."
00:43:01.745,00:43:04.665,"Ladies. Ladies, if I may interject."
00:43:04.748,00:43:07.209,I just want to say you all look stunning.
00:43:07.376,00:43:09.044,That's a given. Head to toe.
00:43:09.128,00:43:12.089,"But, sadly, we need to agree on one."
00:43:12.214,00:43:14.592,"Well, I mean, ladies, you all look beautiful."
00:43:14.675,00:43:18.262,"But I just think, personally, the Fritz Bernaise is just..."
00:43:18.387,00:43:19.680,-I mean... -It's a Bernaise.
00:43:19.763,00:43:22.224,This is one of a kind. I just...
00:43:22.308,00:43:23.309,I don't think there is a question.
00:43:23.434,00:43:24.435,No. No question.
00:43:25.311,00:43:26.812,There might be a question.
00:43:26.895,00:43:28.689,I might... I might have a question.
00:43:28.772,00:43:30.608,I think this dress would look great on everybody.
00:43:30.691,00:43:32.776,It's a great color. It's a great length.
00:43:32.860,00:43:35.321,It's fun. You can twirl.
00:43:35.404,00:43:37.448,You can move in it.
00:43:37.531,00:43:39.199,You can spread your legs apart.
00:43:39.283,00:43:41.619,And it's a great price.
00:43:44.830,00:43:46.123,Is anyone else hot?
00:43:46.248,00:43:47.499,It is like an oven in here.
00:43:48.000,00:43:50.711,"Okay, well, maybe this might help you decide."
00:43:50.794,00:43:57.051,"While you gals were in the changing room, I happened to rustle up a two-year-old Lady JuJu dress in storage."
00:43:57.134,00:44:00.554,I had Lillian put it on so you could see what you'll be standing next to.
00:44:00.721,00:44:02.181,"Lillian, honey."
00:44:02.306,00:44:03.974,My God.
00:44:06.185,00:44:07.561,Beautiful length.
00:44:07.686,00:44:09.104,Breathtaking.
00:44:09.188,00:44:12.900,Holy shit! You look amazing.
00:44:13.025,00:44:15.569,-That's a dress. -That dress is so pretty it makes my stomach hurt.
00:44:17.696,00:44:20.866,"Lillian, I don't know what to say."
00:44:24.286,00:44:25.329,"Megan, are you okay?"
00:44:32.378,00:44:33.879,My dress was probably just tight.
00:44:33.962,00:44:35.297,"Oh, my God."
00:44:35.381,00:44:37.675,"You got food poisoning from that restaurant, didn't you?"
00:44:37.966,00:44:42.930,"No, I had the same thing that she had -Oh, my... Okay. -Oh, no."
00:44:43.138,00:44:44.640,-Why is this happening? -Nothing is happening.
00:44:49.561,00:44:51.647,It doesn't matter to me. I just need to get off this white carpet.
00:44:51.730,00:44:53.190,"-Oh, God. -Okay. No, not the bathroom."
00:44:53.273,00:44:55.984,Everybody go outside. I'm serious!
00:44:56.068,00:44:58.028,There is a bathroom across the street.
00:45:00.239,00:45:02.449,I think everybody has the flu.
00:45:05.077,00:45:06.203,Shit!
00:45:07.579,00:45:09.748,I need the toilet! I need the toilet!
00:45:11.583,00:45:13.502,I need the toilet!
00:45:13.585,00:45:15.087,No!
00:45:16.088,00:45:18.841,"No. No, Megan. No! No!"
00:45:18.924,00:45:20.634,"-Look away! -Megan, no!"
00:45:20.759,00:45:21.844,Look away!
00:45:26.765,00:45:29.435,"You don't look very well, Annie."
00:45:30.644,00:45:31.687,I feel fine.
00:45:32.020,00:45:35.858,Are you sure? It wasn't that gray kind of lamb?
00:45:35.941,00:45:37.734,You ate a lot of that weird chicken.
00:45:38.110,00:45:39.695,Was it that?
00:45:39.778,00:45:42.030,No. I'm...
00:45:42.114,00:45:43.282,I... I feel fine.
00:45:44.491,00:45:47.286,I think you'd just feel better if you threw up.
00:45:49.621,00:45:51.290,I don't have... I don't have to throw up.
00:45:54.001,00:45:55.043,I am so sorry.
00:45:55.127,00:45:56.128,Get away from me!
00:45:57.045,00:45:58.046,You're not sick?
00:45:58.130,00:45:59.173,-No. -No?
00:45:59.256,00:46:02.342,"In fact, Helen, I'm hungry."
00:46:02.426,00:46:04.595,And I wish I had a snack.
00:46:04.803,00:46:05.804,You're hungry?
00:46:06.805,00:46:08.307,I'm starving.
00:46:09.766,00:46:10.851,What did we eat?
00:46:12.186,00:46:14.104,-The sink is a goner. -What are you doing?
00:46:14.188,00:46:15.814,It's coming out of me like lava!
00:46:18.233,00:46:19.610,Don't you fucking look at me!
00:46:21.987,00:46:22.988,Hmm?
00:46:23.489,00:46:24.490,Jordan almonds.
00:46:24.948,00:46:25.949,These are great.
00:46:26.700,00:46:28.035,Thank you.
00:46:38.545,00:46:39.755,Better?
00:46:40.923,00:46:42.257,I was... I was just hungry.
00:46:42.341,00:46:43.592,Yeah.
00:46:44.885,00:46:47.262,"Annie, everybody is really sick from that restaurant."
00:46:49.014,00:46:50.599,"-But it wasn't the restaurant. -No, no, no, no."
00:46:50.682,00:46:52.100,"-Lillian, where are you going? -No."
00:46:52.184,00:46:53.227,I need a bathroom.
00:46:55.354,00:46:56.313,No. No.
00:47:01.193,00:47:02.861,It's happening. It's happening.
00:47:02.986,00:47:04.696,It's happening. It's happening.
00:47:09.660,00:47:11.036,It happened.
00:47:12.204,00:47:14.748,No. Don't you dare ruin that dress!
00:47:15.707,00:47:17.251,"Oh. You're really doing it, aren't you?"
00:47:17.376,00:47:18.961,You're really shitting in the street.
00:47:29.304,00:47:31.056,We'll just take five of the Fritz Bernaises.
00:47:31.139,00:47:32.766,"Thank you, Whitney. They really do look better."
00:47:32.849,00:47:34.518,-Right. -Thank you.
00:47:38.480,00:47:39.731,You okay?
00:47:41.817,00:47:45.153,I just took a shit in the middle of the street.
00:47:45.237,00:47:46.863,-I just shit. -People do that.
00:47:46.947,00:47:50.951,I shit... I shitted in my shorts. I shit myself.
00:47:56.915,00:47:58.750,"-That was fun. -Oh, my gosh."
00:48:00.752,00:48:02.296,You know what I was thinking?
00:48:04.089,00:48:07.009,"You should come with me to Lillian's wedding, maybe."
00:48:07.342,00:48:09.428,Not like that. Not like anything serious.
00:48:09.511,00:48:11.346,"But just like a fun time, you know?"
00:48:11.430,00:48:16.018,"We can get dressed up, and we can go dancing and have a drink."
00:48:17.936,00:48:23.650,"No. I mean, I don't want to make you have to explain to all those people what our relationship is."
00:48:24.067,00:48:27.571,That would suck for you. Right?
00:48:28.322,00:48:29.656,Yeah. I guess so.
00:48:30.157,00:48:31.867,-I'm just thinking of you. -Yeah.
00:48:31.950,00:48:34.536,"No, it's okay."
00:48:34.620,00:48:37.914,"I have someone else I can ask, anyway. So..."
00:48:39.416,00:48:40.959,-Really? -Yeah.
00:48:41.043,00:48:42.169,Who?
00:48:42.252,00:48:43.503,"Um... This guy, George."
00:48:45.213,00:48:46.882,George Glass.
00:48:50.177,00:48:51.261,Okay.
00:48:52.929,00:48:55.432,Who is this George?
00:48:56.016,00:49:03.649,"He is a very hot, nice guy who likes me a lot, and would probably love to be my date."
00:49:03.732,00:49:04.733,-Really? -Mmm-hmm.
00:49:04.816,00:49:05.817,Mmm-hmm.
00:49:09.237,00:49:10.238,Mmm.
00:49:10.530,00:49:12.616,"Well, let me ask you this."
00:49:12.824,00:49:20.666,Can this George Glass do this to you?
00:49:31.510,00:49:32.844,Probably.
00:49:33.553,00:49:36.348,You know what? It's getting really late.
00:49:36.431,00:49:39.893,You should probably go. I'm going to miss you so much.
00:50:00.038,00:50:01.039,Oh.
00:50:04.084,00:50:05.085,Annie Walker.
00:50:05.377,00:50:06.378,Hi.
00:50:06.461,00:50:07.713,-Hey. -Hey.
00:50:07.963,00:50:10.215,What brings you in here so early?
00:50:10.298,00:50:14.052,-I've just had a bad night. Boy stuff. -Aw.
00:50:14.553,00:50:16.138,Do you want me to arrest anybody?
00:50:16.221,00:50:18.265,-I could do that. -Actually... No.
00:50:18.682,00:50:21.810,Do you want to talk to a cop about it? We're just like priests.
00:50:23.478,00:50:25.605,Except we can tell everybody about it afterwards.
00:50:25.689,00:50:26.732,"-Oh. -I won't, though."
00:50:27.190,00:50:28.400,Doesn't sound very inviting.
00:50:29.985,00:50:31.153,You want a carrot?
00:50:33.071,00:50:34.364,-Right now? -Yeah.
00:50:34.990,00:50:37.159,I'll share. I've got plenty.
00:50:38.243,00:50:39.369,"Sure, I'll have a carrot."
00:50:39.494,00:50:40.579,Yeah?
00:50:42.414,00:50:44.374,"Oh. Yeah, that sounds rough."
00:50:45.876,00:50:46.960,"It's going to get better, right?"
00:50:47.043,00:50:48.044,I wouldn't have thought so.
00:50:48.128,00:50:54.843,"You know, my sister was a maid of honor at our cousin's wedding, and she found it so stressful, her hair started falling out."
00:50:54.926,00:50:56.678,-That's terrible. -Yeah.
00:50:56.762,00:50:58.889,"It grew back, but it was..."
00:50:59.556,00:51:01.057,It was pretty gross.
00:51:01.475,00:51:02.809,Planning a wedding should be fun.
00:51:02.893,00:51:08.231,"You know what? If I ever had a wedding, I'd want everybody to be stress-free, you know?"
00:51:08.356,00:51:10.066,I'd like it to be like a carnival.
00:51:10.567,00:51:14.654,"Like, people win prizes for guessing the bride's weight."
00:51:14.905,00:51:16.239,Dunk tanks.
00:51:16.323,00:51:17.449,-Yeah. -You know?
00:51:17.532,00:51:21.536,"Mmm-hmm. You could have elephants, and the bride and groom can walk on a little tightrope."
00:51:21.620,00:51:24.456,"Okay, what you are talking about there, that's a circus wedding."
00:51:24.623,00:51:26.249,-It's a totally different... -Right.
00:51:26.333,00:51:27.751,-You missed it. -Yeah.
00:51:28.502,00:51:33.340,"Hey, you know, instead of stressing out about this wedding, you know what you should be doing?"
00:51:34.424,00:51:36.551,Setting up a new bakery!
00:51:39.513,00:51:40.889,"No, I'm kind of done with that."
00:51:41.431,00:51:42.474,What?
00:51:43.225,00:51:45.101,I don't do it anymore.
00:51:45.310,00:51:46.645,All right.
00:51:47.604,00:51:50.357,-Ew. -Oh!
00:51:51.024,00:51:52.359,-You got the ugly carrot. -What?
00:51:52.943,00:51:54.945,There's one in every bag. You have to eat it. It's good luck.
00:51:55.028,00:51:57.364,-I'm not eating this. -Yeah! I'll eat it.
00:51:57.656,00:51:59.991,"It's the lucky carrot? No, don't eat it! Don't eat it. Don't eat it!"
00:52:00.867,00:52:05.038,"-Well, don't litter! I'll fine you. -I'm sorry."
00:52:05.664,00:52:07.207,"You know what? Actually, I'm going to pick it up."
00:52:07.290,00:52:08.583,-It really bothers me. -Sorry.
00:52:08.667,00:52:12.838,I'm sorry. It's just that I'm anal about that kind of thing.
00:52:16.299,00:52:21.263,I didn't know that you could be a cop here if you weren't a citizen.
00:52:22.138,00:52:23.223,-You can't. -No?
00:52:23.306,00:52:25.141,"No. No, you can't."
00:52:25.225,00:52:29.271,But they made a special dispensation because I'm so tough and strong.
00:52:29.396,00:52:30.856,-Oh. Right. -And handsome.
00:52:30.939,00:52:32.232,Okay.
00:52:32.315,00:52:33.859,You're pretty... You're pretty tough.
00:52:34.734,00:52:36.778,-I am tough. -You're tough. You're a tough cop.
00:52:36.862,00:52:38.029,"Look. You're saying it, but you're laughing."
00:52:38.113,00:52:39.239,"No, you're... You're..."
00:52:39.364,00:52:40.574,You didn't let me flex that time.
00:52:40.657,00:52:41.867,That was unfair. I'm really tough.
00:52:42.200,00:52:44.035,-So am I. -No.
00:52:44.119,00:52:46.371,Yeah. I could be a cop.
00:52:46.496,00:52:49.416,-You think you could be a cop? -Yeah.
00:52:49.583,00:52:50.584,-Okay. -Yeah.
00:52:50.667,00:52:52.502,Let's see. You know what?
00:52:52.586,00:52:55.672,The sun is nearly up. Let's go and see if you've got what it takes.
00:52:57.674,00:52:58.675,"That's right. Now, plant your feet."
00:52:59.968,00:53:01.011,Good.
00:53:01.511,00:53:03.013,And take aim.
00:53:04.598,00:53:07.934,"Now, put your left hand behind your head."
00:53:08.935,00:53:10.770,Yeah. And just drop your left hip.
00:53:14.608,00:53:16.610,-I'm kidding. Put your arms out straight. -Okay.
00:53:16.943,00:53:18.820,You want to hit the middle of the license plate.
00:53:18.904,00:53:20.363,That's where you get the most accurate reading.
00:53:20.447,00:53:22.532,"-Okay. -Okay, here we go. You ready?"
00:53:25.410,00:53:28.288,Fifty-eight. What's the speed limit?
00:53:28.371,00:53:29.581,Fifty-five.
00:53:29.664,00:53:32.250,"Okay, they were all right. We'll let them go."
00:53:32.334,00:53:34.961,You were born to do this. Look at you.
00:53:35.837,00:53:37.213,"-Okay. -All right, here we go."
00:53:39.299,00:53:40.926,Sixty-three.
00:53:41.259,00:53:42.594,You're missing some good ones here.
00:53:42.677,00:53:45.972,People are on their way to work. Why ruin their day?
00:53:46.681,00:53:48.183,"Okay, watch this. 48."
00:53:49.935,00:53:50.936,Forty-eight. How did you do that?
00:53:51.019,00:53:52.270,"-It wasn't! -Yes, it was."
00:53:52.437,00:53:53.855,-That's never happened. -Are you serious?
00:53:53.939,00:53:55.357,"-It was 48? -Yes, 48!"
00:53:55.440,00:53:57.108,-Yeah. -I'm so impressed.
00:53:57.192,00:53:58.360,I'm pretty impressive.
00:53:58.443,00:54:00.403,I'm very impressed by you.
00:54:01.154,00:54:02.155,Whoa!
00:54:02.530,00:54:03.531,Whoa!
00:54:03.740,00:54:05.200,-Whoa! -Damn!
00:54:05.992,00:54:07.160,-That was 91. -91?
00:54:07.243,00:54:08.244,Yes. Can we go?
00:54:08.328,00:54:09.329,We can go.
00:54:10.538,00:54:11.581,"Come on, hot dogger."
00:54:17.545,00:54:18.922,"Oh, my God!"
00:54:28.431,00:54:31.476,...family lake house. Perfect.
00:54:39.526,00:54:43.196,-Hello? -I just got your e-mail. Lake house?
00:54:43.780,00:54:45.615,Yeah.
00:54:45.699,00:54:48.034,"Yeah, it's Lillian's parents' house."
00:54:48.201,00:54:50.704,We used to go there all the time in the summers and everything.
00:54:50.787,00:54:53.289,-It's one of... -A bachelorette in a cabin?
00:54:56.084,00:54:57.127,Hello?
00:54:57.502,00:54:59.504,Fucking Helen. Hello?
00:54:59.587,00:55:01.339,"Annie, it's Rita."
00:55:01.423,00:55:02.424,Hi.
00:55:02.549,00:55:07.971,"Listen, I need a trip that I can fantasize forever so that I'm able to have sex with my husband."
00:55:08.221,00:55:10.265,That's why I'm thinking Vegas.
00:55:11.266,00:55:12.267,Vegas?
00:55:12.350,00:55:13.351,Hang on. Hey!
00:55:13.435,00:55:15.937,Shut your filthy fucking mouths! I'm sorry.
00:55:16.146,00:55:17.564,I'm surrounded by savages.
00:55:18.690,00:55:20.608,You know what? I should probably run. My other line is ringing.
00:55:20.692,00:55:22.944,"You know, I can get cocaine from my hairdresser."
00:55:23.194,00:55:25.530,"Okay, bye. Hello?"
00:55:25.822,00:55:26.823,-Annie. -Yeah?
00:55:26.906,00:55:29.993,I'm so excited. Helen just called. She said we can go to Vegas.
00:55:30.118,00:55:32.954,"You know... Yeah, but we have to... We have to fly there, and..."
00:55:33.038,00:55:39.294,"Okay, Annie, I know you're afraid of flying, but I want to see Criss Angel, but I'm scared."
00:55:40.086,00:55:41.504,Which I sort of love.
00:55:43.381,00:55:45.592,"-Oh, sure, sure, sure. I... -Thanks. Hold on. God damn it."
00:55:45.675,00:55:47.594,"-Hello? -Hey, Annie, it's Megan."
00:55:47.677,00:55:48.887,"Oh, hey."
00:55:48.970,00:55:51.181,I just had some thoughts about the bachelorette party.
00:55:51.264,00:55:52.849,"Okay, here we go."
00:55:53.099,00:55:54.434,Easy-peasy. Vegas it is.
00:55:56.770,00:55:58.480,"Yeah, she got the jump on you."
00:56:01.983,00:56:03.276,"Honestly, I think it's Vegas."
00:56:03.401,00:56:05.487,-I love puppets. -Balls!
00:56:05.570,00:56:06.821,I guess we're undecided.
00:56:36.935,00:56:38.978,I feel so bad Annie's stuck back in coach.
00:56:39.145,00:56:44.317,"I know, I offered to pay for her so she could sit in first class, but she said no."
00:56:44.400,00:56:45.527,She's too proud.
00:56:45.610,00:56:47.195,It was nice of you to offer.
00:56:49.823,00:56:50.949,"No carry-on, huh?"
00:56:51.699,00:56:53.451,"-No. -Yeah, I noticed."
00:56:53.535,00:56:55.870,I noticed you didn't put anything in the overhead bin either.
00:56:56.162,00:56:57.205,And I get it.
00:56:57.288,00:57:02.335,"I get it. I want you to know, protect and serve Air Marshal-style."
00:57:02.877,00:57:04.003,What?
00:57:04.087,00:57:05.755,"I don't want to infringe on your privacy, man."
00:57:05.839,00:57:08.716,I just... I really appreciate what you do for this country.
00:57:09.259,00:57:11.136,And I respect the hell out of you.
00:57:13.221,00:57:14.305,That's great.
00:57:14.722,00:57:16.850,I'm not an Air Marshal. I'm going to take a nap.
00:57:16.975,00:57:18.101,-Awesome. -Cool.
00:57:18.184,00:57:20.478,I'll take the first watch.
00:57:21.062,00:57:24.399,I'm not an Air Marshal. You don't need to take a watch.
00:57:24.482,00:57:25.650,Okay.
00:57:30.238,00:57:32.407,and that your seat backs are in an upright position before takeoff.
00:57:32.490,00:57:33.491,"Oh, gosh."
00:57:33.575,00:57:39.164,"I am really hoping this flight is quick, and we get there on the ground safely."
00:57:39.247,00:57:40.331,"I'm not a good flyer, I'm sorry."
00:57:40.665,00:57:43.585,I had a dream last night that we went down.
00:57:43.668,00:57:46.463,Yep. It was terrible. You were in it.
00:57:46.546,00:57:49.007,"-What? -Oh, God, it sounds like something's happening."
00:57:58.600,00:57:59.976,"Annie, what are you doing up here?"
00:58:00.101,00:58:01.436,You're supposed to be in your seat.
00:58:01.519,00:58:02.896,I know. I'm freaking out a little bit.
00:58:02.979,00:58:05.815,"Ma'am, we're still ascending. You're gonna need to return to your seat."
00:58:05.982,00:58:07.233,"Okay, I was just..."
00:58:07.317,00:58:10.320,"Annie, I have something."
00:58:10.445,00:58:13.072,"Take two, you'll fall asleep, wake up and we'll be there. Here."
00:58:14.699,00:58:17.076,"Ma'am, you're going to have to return to your seat, please."
00:58:17.327,00:58:18.786,-It's fine. -Okay. All right.
00:58:22.040,00:58:25.293,"Oh, my God, I feel terrible. I should be sitting back there with her."
00:58:25.376,00:58:28.296,I shouldn't be up here in first class. I feel like such a jerk.
00:58:28.379,00:58:32.383,"Lil, this is your weekend, okay? You are treating yourself. Just relax."
00:58:32.592,00:58:34.135,She will be fine. She will make friends.
00:58:34.219,00:58:36.888,"There is much more sense of community in coach, I promise you."
00:58:36.971,00:58:38.097,She'll be fine.
00:58:40.892,00:58:43.853,I can't believe you've never been with anybody else.
00:58:44.562,00:58:45.730,Just Kevin.
00:58:49.234,00:58:50.735,I'm sorry. I just...
00:58:50.985,00:58:53.404,"Becca, I just can't help but feel bad for you."
00:58:53.780,00:58:56.157,You don't even know what you want.
00:58:56.324,00:58:58.159,"I got to know where you keep the gun, man."
00:58:58.409,00:59:00.870,"I mean, is it ankle, hip, lower back?"
00:59:00.954,00:59:03.706,"You don't... Between the cheeks, do you?"
00:59:03.790,00:59:08.670,"No, I don't stick a gun up my butt. That's stupid."
00:59:08.753,00:59:09.921,I didn't say up.
00:59:10.129,00:59:13.883,"I just knew of a guy, that guy did a lot of undercover work."
00:59:14.008,00:59:17.929,And all I know is he had tape marks all up and down his cheeks.
00:59:18.763,00:59:20.056,That can't be true.
00:59:20.181,00:59:24.978,"People don't keep guns up their asses because if you needed to use it, how are you going to get it?"
00:59:25.061,00:59:26.521,He cut a hole in his pocket.
00:59:26.604,00:59:28.439,-What? -In his back pocket.
00:59:28.690,00:59:34.362,"You have got to get something out of your ass and you cut a hole in the back of your jeans, you want to tell me you can't get to something?"
00:59:34.904,00:59:38.199,I don't have a gun for you to put up my ass to make your point.
00:59:38.283,00:59:40.159,I can put my Nano. I will show you.
00:59:40.243,00:59:43.162,"I will... If you get me scissors, I will cut a hole in my pocket."
00:59:43.663,00:59:47.584,And you will never find this again until I want you to find it.
00:59:48.793,00:59:56.676,"Kevin can only have sex in bed, in the dark, under the covers, only after we have showered separately."
00:59:57.802,01:00:02.056,"And sometimes, by the time we're finished cleaning ourselves, he's too tired."
01:00:04.851,01:00:07.645,but I'm not tired. I'm not tired! I'm not tired.
01:00:07.812,01:00:11.107,That's why every girl needs those slutty college years.
01:00:11.190,01:00:14.694,"To experiment, get it out of your system, find out what you like."
01:00:15.361,01:00:18.698,"Excuse me, could I have a glass of alcohol when you get a chance?"
01:00:19.616,01:00:22.493,Two double Seven and Sevens.
01:00:23.369,01:00:24.871,Is that...
01:00:25.038,01:00:27.206,You'll like it. It's sweet.
01:00:27.874,01:00:28.875,I have to go to the bathroom.
01:00:29.042,01:00:32.003,But I heard about a woman who went to the bathroom on a plane.
01:00:32.170,01:00:34.172,She got sucked into the toilet.
01:00:35.173,01:00:36.841,Sucked right in.
01:00:39.969,01:00:41.095,Are you okay?
01:00:41.220,01:00:42.388,Yes.
01:00:42.555,01:00:46.017,"Yeah, I just think that what you gave me didn't really do anything."
01:00:46.184,01:00:49.729,"I just have too much adrenalin or something. But, thanks."
01:00:50.480,01:00:53.149,Why don't you take my scotch?
01:00:53.316,01:00:56.194,It will just give the pill a little kick that it needs.
01:00:56.361,01:00:58.029,"-Honestly, I do it all the time. -Yeah?"
01:00:58.196,01:01:00.698,"Yeah, and I'm much smaller than you, so you'll handle it."
01:01:00.782,01:01:02.909,"Well... Okay. Well, thanks."
01:01:03.076,01:01:04.535,-Yeah? -Okay.
01:01:18.049,01:01:19.133,Yummy?
01:01:19.258,01:01:20.385,"Yeah, it's good."
01:01:20.551,01:01:22.970,You should just toss it back. Don't waste any more time.
01:01:23.054,01:01:24.097,Okay.
01:01:28.768,01:01:29.936,Oh. Look at that.
01:01:32.063,01:01:35.400,"Okay, that'll do it. That'll do it."
01:01:35.858,01:01:37.568,So you don't even have sex anymore?
01:01:37.735,01:01:40.071,"No, I have sex constantly."
01:01:40.363,01:01:41.698,The sex is constant.
01:01:41.864,01:01:44.534,But he hasn't kissed me in five years.
01:01:44.701,01:01:46.160,"What are you doing when you're having sex, then?"
01:01:47.245,01:01:50.081,Thinking about other things and wishing it would stop.
01:01:50.915,01:01:54.961,"You know, sometimes I just want to watch The Daily Show without him entering me."
01:01:55.962,01:01:59.549,-It's the Wet Republic Ultra Pool. -No. Are you kidding?
01:01:59.716,01:02:01.008,What is it again?
01:02:06.764,01:02:10.268,Wait a minute. Is this that place that was on The Real World?
01:02:10.435,01:02:13.104,"Are you kidding me? Oh, my God. It's..."
01:02:13.271,01:02:15.815,"Hey, buddy. How you doing?"
01:02:15.898,01:02:20.278,"I'm good. I'm so much more relaxed. Thank you, Helen."
01:02:20.361,01:02:24.490,"I just feel like I'm excited, and I feel relaxed."
01:02:26.951,01:02:34.000,to party with the best of them!
01:02:38.755,01:02:43.509,Wow! It looks like somebody is really relaxing now.
01:02:43.801,01:02:46.846,What are you guys talking about up here?
01:02:47.013,01:02:49.682,"We are going to a restaurant tonight. I know the owner, so..."
01:02:49.849,01:02:51.309,You do?
01:02:53.144,01:02:55.313,Oh. Helen knows the owner.
01:02:56.355,01:02:57.356,Ugh!
01:02:59.484,01:03:00.651,Big whoop.
01:03:00.818,01:03:02.820,"Okay, let's go take a nap. What do you say?"
01:03:02.987,01:03:05.031,"Miss, you cannot be up here."
01:03:08.618,01:03:12.330,"I'm sorry. I just want to be here with my friends, because I'm with this group."
01:03:12.497,01:03:15.500,The sign just went off. Can't she stay up here for a minute and just talk?
01:03:16.709,01:03:18.753,Coach passengers are not allowed up here in first class.
01:03:18.836,01:03:20.171,It's policy. I'm sorry.
01:03:20.338,01:03:21.464,Oh!
01:03:21.547,01:03:25.843,This is a very strict plane that I'm on.
01:03:29.222,01:03:32.850,"Auf Wiedersehen, asshole."
01:03:33.017,01:03:34.060,All right.
01:03:34.227,01:03:35.228,Why don't you go lay down?
01:03:35.311,01:03:37.772,I'm going to go take a nap. I'm tired.
01:03:37.855,01:03:38.898,I think it's a good idea.
01:03:39.065,01:03:42.235,"Catch you on the flip side, motherfuckers."
01:03:43.361,01:03:44.320,I'm sorry.
01:03:44.403,01:03:45.488,I'm leaving.
01:03:45.571,01:03:46.614,Thank you.
01:03:47.907,01:03:50.284,"This should be open, because it's civil rights."
01:03:50.535,01:03:51.828,This is the '90s.
01:03:51.994,01:03:54.997,Right. It's not. You're in the wrong decade.
01:03:55.164,01:03:56.874,"-You are. -Okay, I am."
01:03:57.041,01:03:58.042,Thank you.
01:03:58.417,01:04:00.878,Holy shit. What did you give her?
01:04:19.689,01:04:20.731,Miss?
01:04:21.566,01:04:24.360,"Um, no. It's not me."
01:04:24.527,01:04:26.654,"Yes, it is you. Please go back to your seat."
01:04:26.737,01:04:28.739,"Yes, I am with him."
01:04:29.240,01:04:31.576,I am Mrs. Iglesias.
01:04:31.742,01:04:32.743,"No, you are not."
01:04:32.910,01:04:35.705,You were just out here and you put sunglasses on. Out.
01:04:36.080,01:04:37.915,But I don't want to.
01:04:37.999,01:04:39.625,"Sir, she can have my seat, okay?"
01:04:39.709,01:04:41.878,Everyone should experience first class at least once in their lives.
01:04:41.961,01:04:44.255,And Annie shouldn't miss out just because she can't afford it.
01:04:44.422,01:04:45.965,"No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's not allowed."
01:04:48.259,01:04:51.012,we're a whole wedding party. I'm the bride. I'm getting married.
01:04:51.095,01:04:54.557,This seat is empty. She's obviously nervous. We'll calm her down and...
01:04:54.640,01:04:55.933,I understand. But Claire is right.
01:04:56.017,01:04:57.393,"Everybody, go back to your seats."
01:04:57.476,01:04:58.936,"Okay, you especially."
01:04:59.103,01:05:01.105,You have three seconds to get back to your seat.
01:05:02.315,01:05:04.400,You can't get anywhere in three seconds.
01:05:04.483,01:05:05.651,"Well, you'd better try."
01:05:05.818,01:05:07.194,You are setting me up for a loss already.
01:05:07.278,01:05:08.279,Thank you.
01:05:09.488,01:05:11.949,"Whatever you say, Stove."
01:05:14.785,01:05:16.579,Stove. What kind of name is that?
01:05:16.746,01:05:18.581,That's not a name. My name is Steve.
01:05:18.748,01:05:19.957,Are you an appliance?
01:05:20.124,01:05:21.959,"No, I'm a man, and my name is Steve."
01:05:22.126,01:05:23.461,You're a flight attendant.
01:05:23.628,01:05:26.297,That's absolutely accurate.
01:05:28.132,01:05:30.468,You can close that. Thank you.
01:05:34.972,01:05:36.933,"Hey, not-Air Marshall Jon."
01:05:37.016,01:05:39.352,You want to get back in that restroom and not rest?
01:05:39.602,01:05:41.562,"No, I have to get back to my seat."
01:05:41.646,01:05:44.273,"Yeah, you gotta get back on my seat."
01:05:46.609,01:05:47.610,You get it?
01:05:47.693,01:05:49.111,"Yeah, I definitely got it."
01:05:49.195,01:05:50.905,Uh-oh. What's that?
01:05:52.782,01:05:55.660,"I got to get back to my seat. Could you just move your leg, please?"
01:05:55.785,01:05:57.328,I got to go.
01:05:57.620,01:05:59.580,Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
01:05:59.664,01:06:01.791,Somebody found a souvenir.
01:06:02.333,01:06:05.962,You feel that steam heat coming? That's from my undercarriage.
01:06:06.337,01:06:08.547,That can go up and higher.
01:06:08.714,01:06:10.132,Okay.
01:06:11.884,01:06:13.678,"Jon, get us a blanket."
01:06:13.803,01:06:15.179,No.
01:06:15.346,01:06:18.015,I got to take a whiz and I'll be right back.
01:06:19.016,01:06:20.059,Cool.
01:06:21.811,01:06:25.815,I don't want you to be a big fuck-up like me.
01:06:25.898,01:06:27.733,Mmm-mmm. How do you think I feel?
01:06:27.817,01:06:30.361,Like me. You can still turn it around.
01:06:30.528,01:06:31.904,"No, don't."
01:06:33.197,01:06:34.365,Stop it!
01:06:34.532,01:06:37.243,You are more beautiful than Cinderella.
01:06:37.410,01:06:41.706,You smell like pine needles and you have a face like sunshine.
01:06:55.219,01:06:56.387,What?
01:06:59.515,01:07:00.683,"Oh, no."
01:07:01.851,01:07:06.605,"Ladies and gentlemen, as you can see, the captain has turned on the fasten seat belt sign."
01:07:06.772,01:07:08.983,It appears we've run into a rough patch of weather...
01:07:10.359,01:07:12.236,There is a Colonial woman on the wing.
01:07:12.319,01:07:15.197,There's a woman on the wing. I saw her. There's something they're not telling us!
01:07:15.281,01:07:16.323,-Steve. -All right.
01:07:17.616,01:07:19.326,"-She was churning butter on that wing. -Steve, get her."
01:07:19.410,01:07:20.911,-She is out there right now. -Shit!
01:07:21.078,01:07:23.372,"Everyone, remain calm! I'm an Air Marshal."
01:07:24.248,01:07:27.126,"Yes! I knew it. I got your back, Jon!"
01:07:27.209,01:07:29.962,There is a woman on the wing. I saw her. There's something they're not telling us.
01:07:30.046,01:07:32.131,Let's get out! Let's open the doors and get out!
01:07:32.214,01:07:34.800,She is dressed in traditional Colonial garb.
01:07:35.259,01:07:37.136,Say goodbye! We're going down!
01:07:37.219,01:07:38.262,Stay calm.
01:07:39.722,01:07:41.390,There is a Colonial woman on the wing.
01:07:41.974,01:07:43.017,I will cover the pilot!
01:07:47.646,01:07:49.732,Who is she? What does she want?
01:08:20.930,01:08:23.974,"Just let me make it up to you, please. You're..."
01:08:24.058,01:08:28.813,"I'm telling you, your shower is going to be amazing."
01:08:28.938,01:08:30.898,I have so many ideas.
01:08:31.065,01:08:32.733,I want to talk to you about the shower.
01:08:32.900,01:08:39.532,I feel like it has been really overwhelming for you.
01:08:40.241,01:08:41.909,It's just starting to make you crazy.
01:08:41.992,01:08:44.495,"No, Lil, I'm fine. I mean..."
01:08:45.913,01:08:49.250,"-Lil, I'm fine. -No, you're not fine."
01:08:49.416,01:09:01.345,"You're not fine, Annie, and we need things to just flow smoothly from now on and Helen just knows how to do this kind of stuff."
01:09:01.512,01:09:03.389,She does it all the time.
01:09:03.556,01:09:05.474,She is good at it. She likes doing it.
01:09:06.016,01:09:13.023,This way you don't have to plan any more lunches or trips.
01:09:13.107,01:09:15.109,You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.
01:09:15.192,01:09:16.527,I get it.
01:09:16.694,01:09:22.074,I think it'll be best here on out for the shower and for everything.
01:09:22.533,01:09:24.869,"Yeah, whatever you want."
01:09:25.035,01:09:27.705,"I mean, it's probably best."
01:09:27.872,01:09:29.957,"I think so, right?"
01:09:30.124,01:09:31.458,Yeah. I just want you to be happy.
01:09:31.625,01:09:33.919,I think that will make me happy. It will be good.
01:09:34.003,01:09:36.046,-Okay. -Good. Okay.
01:09:36.881,01:09:38.090,Good.
01:10:02.406,01:10:03.407,Hey.
01:10:03.782,01:10:04.783,Hey.
01:10:04.992,01:10:07.453,Do you want to hang out?
01:10:21.217,01:10:23.427,It's not funny. Have you ever been kicked off a plane?
01:10:23.594,01:10:24.762,I can't say that I have.
01:10:24.845,01:10:25.846,Thank you.
01:10:25.930,01:10:29.600,All of the girls hate me right now.
01:10:29.767,01:10:31.977,You're like the maid of dishonor.
01:10:34.480,01:10:37.149,"Anyway, I hope Lillian isn't going to be mad at me for too long."
01:10:37.316,01:10:39.026,"No, she'll be all right."
01:10:39.193,01:10:42.154,"I don't know, I just wish things were the way that they used to be, you know."
01:10:42.321,01:10:47.660,"I feel like her life is going off and getting perfect, and mine is just like..."
01:10:49.453,01:10:50.829,"It will turn around, you know."
01:10:50.996,01:10:52.623,I've been hearing that for a long time.
01:10:52.706,01:10:54.291,It's going to turn around. I just know it.
01:10:54.708,01:10:56.293,Anyway.
01:10:57.336,01:10:58.504,You got to bake.
01:10:58.671,01:11:00.464,"I don't really do that anymore, I told you."
01:11:00.547,01:11:01.715,-It's kind of like... -Why?
01:11:01.799,01:11:03.008,"I don't know, it's just..."
01:11:04.802,01:11:10.891,"I don't know, after it just went under, I just, kind of, stopped, I guess."
01:11:10.975,01:11:12.226,It doesn't make me happy anymore.
01:11:13.227,01:11:16.188,"Just because you didn't make any money at it, doesn't mean that you failed at it."
01:11:16.897,01:11:18.649,I lost a lot of money.
01:11:18.816,01:11:20.818,All my money.
01:11:21.026,01:11:22.528,But you are so good at it.
01:11:22.695,01:11:24.154,"Oh, well. Let's change the subject."
01:11:24.363,01:11:26.490,No more baking. I'm done.
01:11:26.657,01:11:28.826,I don't know how you just can't do it anymore.
01:11:28.993,01:11:32.288,"If I wasn't a cop anymore, I would still..."
01:11:32.454,01:11:33.455,Arrest people?
01:11:33.539,01:11:35.541,...go out with a gun and shoot people.
01:11:36.458,01:11:38.961,I probably wouldn't do that. I'm just trying to make you feel better.
01:11:41.130,01:11:42.798,"You're okay, you know."
01:11:44.008,01:11:45.009,You don't know me very well.
01:11:45.134,01:11:47.386,I know you well enough to know that you're not so bad.
01:11:47.553,01:11:49.179,"-You got some stuff. -Oh, yeah."
01:11:49.346,01:11:51.098,You got bits and pieces going on.
01:11:51.181,01:11:52.308,Thanks.
01:11:52.391,01:11:54.393,I've been thinking about you a little bit.
01:11:54.476,01:11:56.145,About me? Really?
01:11:56.312,01:11:57.813,There is something about you.
01:11:58.188,01:12:00.482,Something about you that sticks.
01:12:09.325,01:12:10.701,Where is the bedroom?
01:12:15.497,01:12:18.167,-Sorry. It's a mountain bike. -Are you okay?
01:12:18.334,01:12:19.752,-Do you like mountain biking? -Uh-huh.
01:12:24.340,01:12:25.507,Take this off.
01:12:25.674,01:12:27.259,I'm so glad this is happening.
01:12:27.384,01:12:28.635,So am I.
01:12:43.400,01:12:45.069,-Hello. -Morning.
01:12:45.235,01:12:46.820,"Sorry, I didn't mean to freak you out."
01:12:46.987,01:12:48.197,"No, it's okay."
01:12:48.364,01:12:50.491,-I haven't been sitting here that long. -Oh.
01:12:54.870,01:12:56.330,"Sorry, I guess I fell asleep."
01:12:56.413,01:12:59.375,I didn't mean to sleep over.
01:13:00.417,01:13:01.418,Don't be silly.
01:13:02.544,01:13:04.088,I made you a cappuccino.
01:13:04.213,01:13:06.548,-Made it? -Yeah.
01:13:07.549,01:13:09.426,"So, last night was fun."
01:13:10.511,01:13:13.222,It was. It was very fun.
01:13:14.765,01:13:15.766,I had fun.
01:13:15.933,01:13:17.559,It was fun.
01:13:18.936,01:13:23.565,"If you care to accompany me to the kitchen, the fun may continue."
01:13:23.732,01:13:25.776,A different kind of fun.
01:13:25.943,01:13:29.571,"But why don't you just get dressed and whatever, and..."
01:13:29.738,01:13:31.073,I left your clothes over there.
01:13:31.198,01:13:32.533,Okay.
01:13:32.699,01:13:33.992,And I'll see you in there.
01:13:34.118,01:13:35.452,Okay.
01:13:42.709,01:13:44.503,Your workshop awaits.
01:13:44.753,01:13:49.383,"I know it's a bit crazy, but I popped out and I got a few little baking bits and pieces."
01:13:49.466,01:13:50.717,"Butter, milk."
01:13:51.009,01:13:53.595,Because I thought that it would be fun for us to bake together today.
01:13:53.762,01:13:55.597,"Obviously, you will be doing the baking."
01:13:55.764,01:13:57.349,I will be doing the eating.
01:13:57.516,01:13:59.560,Because you are the expert.
01:14:00.144,01:14:01.687,"Yeah, I don't..."
01:14:01.854,01:14:03.772,I don't really wanna...
01:14:04.314,01:14:05.899,"Sorry. You went to all this trouble, but..."
01:14:05.983,01:14:09.194,"Come on, I know you haven't done it in a while, but it'll be great."
01:14:09.278,01:14:12.364,"Don't be silly, just get into it. You are so good at it."
01:14:13.657,01:14:15.659,"All right. No, I get it."
01:14:15.742,01:14:18.662,It was a bit of a curve ball.
01:14:18.871,01:14:20.789,"Yeah, I think I'm going to go."
01:14:20.956,01:14:24.501,I'm sorry. I should just probably go.
01:14:25.252,01:14:28.797,"Annie, I don't know what you're getting so upset about."
01:14:28.881,01:14:30.299,Because you don't know me.
01:14:30.883,01:14:33.218,You don't know anything about me or my life or...
01:14:33.302,01:14:34.344,"Well, no, because..."
01:14:34.428,01:14:36.722,I don't know what you're trying to do here.
01:14:36.847,01:14:38.891,-I don't need you to fix me. -To fix you?
01:14:39.057,01:14:41.477,"I don't need any help. I mean, who do you think you are?"
01:14:41.643,01:14:44.396,"Jesus, Annie, we had a really good time. And now you're being all..."
01:14:44.521,01:14:47.065,It's my fault. I shouldn't have come here last night.
01:14:47.232,01:14:49.318,Last night was a mistake.
01:14:49.610,01:14:50.986,Fucking hell. All right.
01:15:06.835,01:15:09.671,"Hey, it's Lillian. Leave a message after the beep."
01:15:13.467,01:15:14.468,Um...
01:15:15.093,01:15:19.890,"I'm sure you're probably still a little bit mad at me, but I hope not."
01:15:20.557,01:15:24.728,"Anyway, the excitement still continues with me."
01:15:26.188,01:15:35.239,"I just slept with a cop that pulled me over and I woke up today, and he was really sweet and nice and cute."
01:15:35.531,01:15:38.742,"So, naturally, I ran out as fast as I could."
01:15:38.909,01:15:40.577,What's wrong with me?
01:15:41.119,01:15:42.162,Um...
01:15:42.246,01:15:48.001,"Anyway, I know you're busy and stuff, so just call me when you get a chance."
01:15:48.710,01:15:52.881,I'd love to talk this out with you when you can.
01:15:53.048,01:15:54.925,"Okay, bye."
01:16:05.936,01:16:07.729,It's 11:00 a.m.
01:16:09.398,01:16:11.108,"Oh, shit."
01:16:11.275,01:16:12.943,You got a package.
01:16:13.110,01:16:16.613,"I'd bring it to you, but you said, Don't touch my things."
01:16:47.853,01:16:53.025,at the home of Helen Harris III to celebrate the marriage of Lillian Donovan and Douglas Price.
01:16:53.525,01:16:58.488,Let us shower Lillian with gifts and love. Répondez s'il vous plaît. Yay!
01:17:07.164,01:17:08.957,-Excuse me. -Oh. Hi.
01:17:09.041,01:17:10.500,I'm looking for a birthday gift for my best friend.
01:17:10.709,01:17:11.752,Oh.
01:17:11.835,01:17:14.421,"I want to get her a necklace that says, Best Friends Forever."
01:17:15.172,01:17:16.673,You sure you want it to say Forever?
01:17:17.466,01:17:18.550,"Yeah, why?"
01:17:18.675,01:17:20.344,Come on. Forever?
01:17:21.219,01:17:22.262,Forever.
01:17:22.346,01:17:24.431,I don't think you guys will be best friends forever. No offense.
01:17:24.514,01:17:25.891,But you know...
01:17:25.974,01:17:28.018,The friends you have when you're younger sometimes...
01:17:28.393,01:17:30.437,Sometimes you grow apart when you get older.
01:17:30.520,01:17:32.064,Maybe she'll find a new best friend.
01:17:32.147,01:17:39.363,And maybe she'll be more successful than you are and prettier and richer and skinnier and they end up doing everything together.
01:17:39.821,01:17:41.073,You're... You're weird.
01:17:41.365,01:17:42.949,I'm not weird. Okay?
01:17:43.575,01:17:44.618,"Yes, you are."
01:17:44.701,01:17:45.702,"No, I'm not, and you started it."
01:17:45.869,01:17:47.371,"No, you started it."
01:17:47.537,01:17:49.414,Did you forget to take your Xanax this morning?
01:17:49.581,01:17:50.957,"God, I feel bad for your parents."
01:17:51.041,01:17:52.042,I feel bad for your face.
01:17:52.542,01:17:54.586,"Okay, well, call me when your boobs come in."
01:17:54.711,01:17:56.380,You call me when yours come in.
01:17:56.505,01:17:58.423,"-What, do you have four boyfriends? -Exactly."
01:17:58.590,01:18:01.510,"Yeah, okay, have fun having a baby at your prom."
01:18:01.677,01:18:03.220,You look like an old mop.
01:18:03.387,01:18:05.222,You know what? You're not as popular as you think you are.
01:18:05.305,01:18:06.306,I am very popular.
01:18:06.390,01:18:08.392,I'm sure you are.
01:18:09.017,01:18:10.102,Very popular.
01:18:10.310,01:18:13.855,"Well, you're an old, single loser who is never going to have any friends."
01:18:14.523,01:18:15.816,You're a little cunt.
01:18:23.865,01:18:25.075,I'm sorry.
01:18:28.870,01:18:30.956,"Let me tell my mom, okay."
01:18:31.581,01:18:33.250,I already told her.
01:18:33.792,01:18:34.960,Was she mad?
01:18:35.085,01:18:36.253,Mmm-mmm.
01:18:43.760,01:18:46.096,"Hi, Annie, it's Rhodes again."
01:18:46.179,01:18:51.435,"Since you're not returning any of my calls, I assume that you're not interested in spending any more time with me, which is fine."
01:18:51.810,01:18:55.272,"So don't worry, I won't be bothering you ever again."
01:18:56.106,01:18:57.774,Get those taillights fixed.
01:19:05.615,01:19:09.828,We'd like to invite you to no longer live with us anymore.
01:19:11.288,01:19:13.039,What? What do you mean? I don't get it.
01:19:13.331,01:19:19.212,"The thing is, we decided that it was actually a bit immature for a grown-up brother and sister to still be living together with a roommate."
01:19:19.463,01:19:21.339,"At our age, it's a bit ridiculous, isn't it?"
01:19:21.423,01:19:22.257,Yeah.
01:19:22.340,01:19:24.468,"-We look a bit silly, don't we? -Pathetic."
01:19:24.551,01:19:26.762,So we are actually going to live together alone.
01:19:27.137,01:19:28.346,Without you.
01:19:28.513,01:19:29.973,You're moving out.
01:19:33.769,01:19:34.895,She's not moving.
01:19:34.978,01:19:36.146,She will move.
01:19:36.229,01:19:37.481,-Eventually. -Eventually.
01:19:37.564,01:19:38.648,She has to.
01:19:39.107,01:19:40.192,She is taking it in.
01:19:40.275,01:19:41.818,You have to leave.
01:19:41.902,01:19:43.278,Oh! That's prickly.
01:19:48.658,01:19:50.202,-Hi. -Hi.
01:19:52.204,01:19:54.664,Remember when you thought I hit bottom?
01:19:55.540,01:19:56.875,That wasn't bottom.
01:19:59.711,01:20:02.589,"We're gonna have fun. I, for one, am really glad you're here."
01:20:03.048,01:20:04.341,And guess what?
01:20:04.883,01:20:06.510,Good timing.
01:20:07.010,01:20:09.262,You know what just came in today on the Netflix?
01:20:09.679,01:20:11.848,Cast Away. Tom Hanks.
01:20:12.015,01:20:14.017,"It's like Forrest Gump, but on an island."
01:20:14.184,01:20:16.269,"Honey, you are gonna love it."
01:20:47.717,01:20:49.177,This is her driveway?
01:20:50.720,01:20:52.722,Who is that man?
01:20:56.893,01:20:59.145,Are you a guest of Helen Harris III?
01:20:59.980,01:21:02.107,Yes. Technically. I guess.
01:21:02.274,01:21:04.276,An attendant will meet you at the stables.
01:21:04.568,01:21:05.735,Where?
01:21:05.861,01:21:07.070,The shower is over the second bridge.
01:21:07.237,01:21:10.073,"-Pink lemonade? -Oh. Um, thank you."
01:21:10.240,01:21:13.285,I don't have a cup holder. Can I just give that...
01:21:17.163,01:21:20.292,Pink lemonade. Nice. Nice touch.
01:21:21.793,01:21:23.253,Shit.
01:21:31.094,01:21:33.305,"God damn it, that's good."
01:21:33.388,01:21:34.389,Mmm.
01:22:18.558,01:22:20.352,-Would you like some champagne? -Yes.
01:22:20.810,01:22:21.811,It's French.
01:22:23.021,01:22:24.940,Annie. Hey.
01:22:25.315,01:22:26.316,Hi.
01:22:27.484,01:22:29.319,How are you doing? You're here.
01:22:29.861,01:22:32.322,"Yeah, I'm here. I was invited. Sorry."
01:22:32.739,01:22:35.116,Of course you were invited. I just meant you've arrived.
01:22:38.828,01:22:40.455,Can you believe this? Isn't it amazing?
01:22:41.122,01:22:42.207,Yep.
01:22:42.499,01:22:44.084,Yeah. It's nice.
01:22:44.250,01:22:46.211,Yeah. Pretty.
01:22:46.836,01:22:48.129,Are we okay?
01:22:48.213,01:22:49.798,"Yes, I'm sorry I haven't called."
01:22:50.048,01:22:52.509,"I just didn't want to bug you, but..."
01:22:52.592,01:22:54.928,Forgive me. It just got crazy.
01:22:55.011,01:22:57.806,"-There has been lots of organizing, and... -I have so much to tell you."
01:22:57.889,01:23:00.433,I have to say hi to my aunt or she will get mad at my mom.
01:23:00.517,01:23:03.520,"-No, you gotta go do your party rounds. -Yeah."
01:23:03.687,01:23:04.854,I'll see you in a minute.
01:23:05.021,01:23:06.189,Yeah. Okay.
01:23:06.356,01:23:08.024,"Oh! Rita, you got all our towels."
01:23:08.108,01:23:10.402,"Yes, I did. Because I love you, kitten."
01:23:10.694,01:23:12.028,"All right, let's see what's next."
01:23:12.112,01:23:14.155,"Another one, another one, another one."
01:23:14.948,01:23:18.284,I know who this is from. I can tell by the wrapping.
01:23:18.535,01:23:19.869,Is that you?
01:23:22.372,01:23:24.708,"Annie, you made this."
01:23:25.709,01:23:26.793,Look.
01:23:28.920,01:23:30.505,"It's us, Annie."
01:23:34.551,01:23:36.011,"Oh, my God."
01:23:36.970,01:23:41.975,This is all my favorite stuff from all the stores I love in Milwaukee.
01:23:42.058,01:23:45.103,Annie! This is so unbelievable.
01:23:45.562,01:23:46.604,Wilson Phillips.
01:23:48.023,01:23:49.274,"Man, I love Wilson Phillips."
01:23:49.399,01:23:53.111,"We listened to Hold On probably 10,000 times when I got my driver's license."
01:23:53.194,01:23:56.656,This is such an amazing gift.
01:23:56.740,01:23:58.158,-Thank you. -You're welcome.
01:23:59.242,01:24:05.165,"I feel really bad, Lil, I didn't get a chance to actually get you a present because I've been so busy organizing the shower."
01:24:05.248,01:24:07.792,"Helen, please. It's more than enough."
01:24:07.876,01:24:10.253,Here is a card to say congratulations.
01:24:10.336,01:24:14.132,"Thank you. Gosh, you have really outdone yourself."
01:24:16.468,01:24:17.886,"Oh, my God, Helen."
01:24:22.140,01:24:24.559,Helen's taking me to Paris.
01:24:28.813,01:24:30.315,I got you. I fooled you.
01:24:30.398,01:24:31.399,Look at your face.
01:24:32.525,01:24:38.031,"It's just a little pre-wedding vacation. And while we're there, we're gonna meet the designer of her dress and have a fitting."
01:24:40.825,01:24:43.411,"Oh, my God! This is the best present ever!"
01:24:43.995,01:24:45.538,Thank you so much.
01:24:48.041,01:24:49.626,Are you fucking kidding me?
01:24:51.294,01:24:52.629,"-Annie! -No, Mom."
01:24:52.712,01:24:54.005,Motherfucking Paris?
01:24:55.381,01:24:58.718,"I told you about Paris, Helen. I told you about this whole idea!"
01:25:00.220,01:25:02.806,"What, you're gonna go to Paris with Helen now?"
01:25:02.931,01:25:08.520,"What, you guys are gonna ride around on bikes with berets and fucking baguettes in the basket of the front of your bikes?"
01:25:08.603,01:25:09.771,"Oh, how romantic!"
01:25:10.021,01:25:13.358,What woman gives another woman a trip to Paris?
01:25:13.483,01:25:15.401,Am I right? Lesbian.
01:25:15.485,01:25:17.654,"-We're all thinking it, aren't we? -I'm not."
01:25:17.737,01:25:19.614,"-Okay? Yes, we're all thinking it, right? -I was."
01:25:19.697,01:25:20.532,Annie...
01:25:20.615,01:25:22.283,"Lillian, this is not the you that I know."
01:25:22.367,01:25:28.665,"The you that I know would have walked in here and rolled your eyes and thought this was completely over-the-top, ridiculous and stupid."
01:25:28.748,01:25:32.460,Look at this shower! Look at that fucking cookie!
01:25:32.669,01:25:36.714,Did you really think that this group of women was going to finish that cookie?
01:25:36.798,01:25:38.508,"Really? You know what? That reminds me, actually."
01:25:38.716,01:25:42.220,I never got a chance to try that fucking cookie!
01:25:43.847,01:25:45.682,Stupid fucking cookie!
01:25:49.435,01:25:52.272,Delicious! Stupid cookie. I think I'll...
01:25:53.523,01:25:56.526,Maybe it's better if I dip it in the chocolate.
01:26:03.575,01:26:04.784,"Is this what you want, Lillian?"
01:26:11.708,01:26:13.001,So awesome.
01:26:13.084,01:26:19.465,"All right, let's have some nice, hot, unsanitary chocolate!"
01:26:26.389,01:26:28.516,Ahh! It's hot! Jesus! God!
01:26:28.600,01:26:31.311,"Christ, Annie. Have you lost your fucking mind?"
01:26:31.394,01:26:33.229,-What are you doing? -What am I doing?
01:26:33.313,01:26:35.398,"You wouldn't know, would you? Where have you been?"
01:26:35.481,01:26:37.650,"You would have no idea. Let me fill you in, okay?"
01:26:37.901,01:26:40.278,"Ever since you got engaged, everything has turned to shit!"
01:26:40.361,01:26:43.072,You know what? This is supposed to be about my time!
01:26:43.239,01:26:47.327,You have managed to ruin every event in my wedding. Thank you very much.
01:26:47.410,01:26:50.371,"Okay, well, thank you very much. It's all her fault. It is not mine!"
01:26:50.455,01:26:54.876,"And you would know that, if you got your beautiful haired head out of your asshole."
01:26:55.126,01:26:59.130,"In fact, out of her asshole, which I'm sure is perfectly bleached."
01:26:59.214,01:27:00.882,You know what? It is!
01:27:01.216,01:27:02.383,And you know how I know?
01:27:02.467,01:27:06.596,"Because I went to the fucking salon with her and I got my asshole bleached, too!"
01:27:06.846,01:27:08.598,And I love my new asshole!
01:27:10.600,01:27:16.940,"You know what? Why can't you just be happy for me and then go home and talk behind my back later, like a normal person?"
01:27:18.524,01:27:21.069,"I am happy for you, Lillian. I am very happy for you."
01:27:21.152,01:27:24.781,I wish you well. I won't bother you anymore.
01:27:25.740,01:27:28.451,Are you kidding me? Annie!
01:27:28.534,01:27:30.245,"Go, go, go, go, go!"
01:27:34.666,01:27:37.210,"No, no! She does not get a party favor."
01:27:37.460,01:27:39.295,She does not get a dog!
01:27:41.881,01:27:45.969,"And if you're going to act like this, then don't even bother coming to my wedding!"
01:27:54.519,01:27:56.354,"-I'm proud of you, Lil. -Shut up, Helen!"
01:27:58.398,01:28:01.317,Anybody else have anything they want to share today?
01:28:03.569,01:28:06.823,I took two dogs already. They're in the back of my van.
01:28:25.300,01:28:26.592,What?
01:28:36.144,01:28:38.688,What? Where are you going?
01:28:39.397,01:28:40.982,Hit and run! Classy!
01:28:41.190,01:28:42.650,Perfect! Okay.
01:28:47.488,01:28:51.868,Come on! Come on! Come on.
01:28:55.330,01:28:57.332,No!
01:29:12.597,01:29:14.891,Shit.
01:29:18.519,01:29:20.730,I can't say I'm surprised.
01:29:20.897,01:29:23.066,I did tell you to get your lights fixed.
01:29:23.232,01:29:24.650,"Yeah, I know."
01:29:24.734,01:29:26.819,"And now, here we are."
01:29:28.529,01:29:31.908,"Look, I have had a horrible day."
01:29:31.991,01:29:34.369,"I don't need a lecture from you right now, okay?"
01:29:34.619,01:29:36.162,I just... Helen just...
01:29:36.245,01:29:37.246,Oh! Don't...
01:29:38.039,01:29:39.791,This didn't happen because of Helen.
01:29:40.124,01:29:42.877,This happened because you didn't get your taillights fixed.
01:29:43.044,01:29:44.504,It's pretty simple.
01:29:48.007,01:29:55.640,"Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to see you, night by night, drive past me with your fucking taillights still broken?"
01:29:55.807,01:29:57.934,Do you have any idea how crazy that makes me?
01:29:58.101,01:30:00.353,It's a simple solution!
01:30:00.478,01:30:07.026,"Your problem, Annie, is that you just don't understand that you can hurt people with these broken lights."
01:30:08.277,01:30:10.363,Don't you see how irresponsible this is?
01:30:10.446,01:30:14.200,"Yes, I should have gotten my fucking taillights fixed."
01:30:14.283,01:30:16.202,"But I didn't, okay? I didn't."
01:30:16.452,01:30:18.621,"Listen, don't worry about it."
01:30:18.788,01:30:21.332,Seriously. Your message was received.
01:30:21.415,01:30:24.127,"No, look, please, I don't know what's going on with me right now."
01:30:24.210,01:30:28.005,"Look, it's fine. Don't bother. Really, what's done is done."
01:30:28.381,01:30:29.674,That's it? Where are you going?
01:30:29.757,01:30:32.385,That's it! That's it. That's how this works.
01:30:32.802,01:30:33.803,Come on. I didn't...
01:30:33.886,01:30:37.640,"For the record, Annie, you flirted with me."
01:30:37.932,01:30:43.354,"You made me feel like you really liked me, which was really unfair."
01:30:43.771,01:30:50.695,"And then you came home with me and we did stuff, fun stuff, and then you just left, just like it was nothing."
01:30:51.237,01:30:54.574,"Oh, please. I know how guys do this thing."
01:30:54.657,01:30:56.159,I know how guys act.
01:30:56.534,01:30:59.120,"One minute, it means something. The next minute, it doesn't."
01:30:59.203,01:31:00.413,"Right, yeah, you've got it all figured out."
01:31:00.496,01:31:01.414,Yeah.
01:31:01.497,01:31:04.208,How is that working out for you? Pretty good?
01:31:07.503,01:31:08.713,Boom!
01:31:08.796,01:31:11.132,"What's up, fuck-buddy? You call for some roadside assistance?"
01:31:15.970,01:31:19.515,"Thanks, officer. I can handle it from here on out."
01:31:24.562,01:31:25.646,Come on!
01:31:26.981,01:31:28.608,I didn't have anyone else to call!
01:31:28.691,01:31:30.026,I didn't know that you were gonna show up!
01:31:30.109,01:31:33.112,"That's the problem with cops, Annie. We're just never there when you need us."
01:31:35.239,01:31:36.282,That cop talks weird.
01:31:46.876,01:31:50.004,Uh-oh. Check it out. Look what's steering the car.
01:31:56.219,01:31:57.845,Thanks again for picking me up.
01:31:57.929,01:31:59.430,Not a problem.
01:32:00.014,01:32:01.390,Were you busy?
01:32:01.599,01:32:03.768,"Well, it is Friday."
01:32:05.978,01:32:08.731,"You know, you look tired."
01:32:08.814,01:32:13.194,"If you're tired, you can totally lay down in my lap, if you want."
01:32:13.736,01:32:14.779,What?
01:32:14.862,01:32:17.073,Just take a little lap-nap.
01:32:23.329,01:32:24.747,If you want.
01:32:25.581,01:32:26.958,Open for biz.
01:32:27.124,01:32:28.668,"Okay, can you just pull over?"
01:32:28.834,01:32:30.753,"Yeah, actually, that's an even better idea."
01:32:30.836,01:32:34.006,"No, no, no, can you please just stop the car? I want to get out."
01:32:34.090,01:32:35.508,"No, it's super gravelly."
01:32:35.591,01:32:37.551,-Please pull over! -Why?
01:32:37.635,01:32:42.265,Because I would rather get murdered out here than spend the next half-an-hour with you.
01:32:42.348,01:32:43.975,Can you please just pull over?
01:32:44.350,01:32:46.435,"Come on, Annie. It's called humor."
01:32:46.602,01:32:48.437,Learn about it.
01:32:49.313,01:32:51.274,"Besides, I would never last a half-hour."
01:32:55.778,01:32:56.946,"Goodbye, Ted."
01:33:01.450,01:33:04.287,"If you're trying to turn me on, it's working."
01:33:06.372,01:33:07.999,You used me!
01:33:08.082,01:33:11.377,No big deal. You are no longer my number three!
01:33:24.473,01:33:25.641,Wilson!
01:33:29.020,01:33:32.648,Wilson! I'm sorry!
01:33:34.483,01:33:36.360,"I'm sorry, Wilson."
01:33:37.320,01:33:39.322,"Wilson, I'm sorry!"
01:33:41.365,01:33:42.658,"Oh, no, Wilson."
01:33:42.742,01:33:43.826,Wilson!
01:33:46.203,01:33:47.872,I'm coming in.
01:33:48.039,01:33:50.041,"Let's go, let's go. And we're walking."
01:33:50.499,01:33:52.335,"Okay, we're walking. Heel. Heel!"
01:33:52.752,01:33:55.087,No pee. No! Not on the carpet!
01:33:55.254,01:33:57.381,"Okay, we're coming... We're coming in."
01:33:57.465,01:33:59.800,Everybody is in and having fun.
01:34:00.009,01:34:02.303,We're having fun. And heel! We're heeling.
01:34:03.012,01:34:04.013,Heel!
01:34:04.430,01:34:05.848,How many of those did you take?
01:34:06.015,01:34:07.433,I took nine.
01:34:07.600,01:34:08.684,I took nine.
01:34:08.851,01:34:13.606,"Yeah, I did slightly over-commit to the whole dog thing."
01:34:13.689,01:34:16.567,"It turns out, I'm probably more comfortable with six."
01:34:16.734,01:34:19.570,It's a lot... That's a lot of energy to deal with.
01:34:19.653,01:34:23.240,"But you wouldn't know anything about that, because you haven't been returning my calls."
01:34:24.950,01:34:26.994,"And say what, Megan?"
01:34:27.078,01:34:30.039,"Say, Hi, I can't get off the couch."
01:34:30.247,01:34:33.709,I got fired from my job. I got kicked out of my apartment.
01:34:33.793,01:34:37.046,I can't pay any of my bills. My car is a piece of shit.
01:34:37.129,01:34:39.673,I don't have any friends. The last time I...
01:34:39.757,01:34:42.134,"You know what I find interesting about that, Annie?"
01:34:42.218,01:34:45.137,It's interesting to me that you have absolutely no friends.
01:34:45.221,01:34:46.722,You know why it's interesting?
01:34:46.806,01:34:49.642,"Here's a friend standing directly in front of you, trying to talk to you."
01:34:49.725,01:34:52.812,And you choose to talk about the fact that you don't have any friends.
01:34:52.895,01:34:54.230,You know what I mean.
01:34:54.313,01:34:55.689,"No, I don't think you want any help."
01:34:55.773,01:34:56.607,That's not true.
01:34:56.690,01:34:57.775,I think you want to have a little pity party.
01:34:57.858,01:34:59.985,I think Annie wants a little pity party.
01:35:00.069,01:35:02.113,"-You're an asshole, Annie! -Oh, my God. What are you doing?"
01:35:02.196,01:35:04.782,You're an asshole. I'm life. Is life bothering you?
01:35:04.865,01:35:07.118,"-Yes! What are you doing? -I'm life, Annie. I'm life, Annie."
01:35:07.326,01:35:09.745,You have got to fight back on life.
01:35:09.829,01:35:11.539,-Megan! -You better learn to fight.
01:35:11.622,01:35:13.833,-'Cause life will... -Megan!
01:35:13.916,01:35:15.709,I'm life and I'm going to bite you in the ass!
01:35:17.670,01:35:19.588,-Megan... -It's not me. I'm your life. Turn over!
01:35:19.839,01:35:21.006,My God!
01:35:21.090,01:35:25.010,"I'm trying to get you to fight for your shitty life, and you won't do it!"
01:35:25.094,01:35:26.095,-You just won't do it. -Stop it.
01:35:26.345,01:35:28.556,You stop slapping yourself. Stop slapping yourself.
01:35:33.102,01:35:34.103,I'm sorry.
01:35:34.687,01:35:35.688,Nice hit.
01:35:38.482,01:35:39.525,All right.
01:35:39.608,01:35:41.819,I'm glad to see you've got a little bit of spark in you.
01:35:42.653,01:35:44.530,I knew that Annie was in there somewhere.
01:35:44.947,01:35:46.407,I think...
01:35:46.490,01:35:49.827,I think you're ready now to hear a little story about a girl.
01:35:50.077,01:35:52.121,A girl named Megan.
01:35:52.288,01:35:55.458,A girl named Megan that didn't have a very good time in high school.
01:35:55.624,01:35:58.669,I'm referring to myself when I say Megan.
01:35:58.836,01:36:00.796,"-It's me, Megan. -Yeah, I got that."
01:36:00.880,01:36:04.508,"I know you look at me now and think, Boy, she must have breezed through high school."
01:36:04.592,01:36:06.093,"Not the case, Annie."
01:36:06.177,01:36:10.055,"No, this was not easy going up and down the halls. Okay?"
01:36:10.139,01:36:13.392,They used to try to blow me up. They threw firecrackers at my head.
01:36:14.018,01:36:15.019,Firecrackers.
01:36:15.436,01:36:17.855,I mean literally. I'm not saying that figuratively.
01:36:17.938,01:36:20.649,I got firecrackers thrown at my head. They called me a freak.
01:36:21.150,01:36:22.443,Do you think I let that break me?
01:36:22.818,01:36:27.948,"Do you think I went home to my mommy, crying, I don't have any friends. Megan doesn't have any friends?"
01:36:28.032,01:36:30.409,"No, I did not. You know what I did?"
01:36:30.493,01:36:33.037,"I pulled myself up, I studied really hard."
01:36:33.120,01:36:35.247,I read every book in the library. And now?
01:36:35.331,01:36:38.292,I work for the government. I have the highest possible security clearance.
01:36:38.375,01:36:39.919,-Don't repeat that! -I won't.
01:36:40.002,01:36:41.045,I can't protect you.
01:36:41.337,01:36:43.631,I know where all the nukes are and I know the codes.
01:36:45.633,01:36:46.675,I won't say anything.
01:36:46.884,01:36:49.011,You would be amazed.
01:36:49.303,01:36:50.596,A lot of shopping malls.
01:36:50.846,01:36:53.390,-Don't repeat that! -I won't.
01:36:53.557,01:36:54.683,I have six houses.
01:36:54.850,01:36:57.937,I bought an 18-wheeler a couple of months ago just because I could.
01:36:58.187,01:36:59.396,"Okay, you lost Lillian."
01:36:59.480,01:37:02.399,"You got another best friend sitting right in front of you, if you would notice."
01:37:03.484,01:37:04.485,Huh?
01:37:04.568,01:37:06.320,"Now, you got to stop feeling sorry for yourself."
01:37:06.987,01:37:10.324,"Okay, 'cause I do not associate with people that blame the world for their problems."
01:37:10.407,01:37:12.201,"'Cause you're your problem, Annie."
01:37:12.368,01:37:14.703,And you're also your solution.
01:37:16.247,01:37:17.790,"Right? I mean, that's..."
01:37:17.873,01:37:19.250,You get that?
01:37:21.210,01:37:22.670,"I just miss her, I guess."
01:37:23.546,01:37:25.089,"Yeah, I know you do."
01:37:26.173,01:37:28.092,I know you do.
01:37:28.551,01:37:30.469,"All right, come on. Bring it in."
01:37:30.553,01:37:31.971,There's the Annie...
01:37:32.054,01:37:33.764,"There's the Annie I knew was there, okay?"
01:37:33.889,01:37:36.141,"All right. Man, you have got to wash your hair."
01:37:36.267,01:37:37.268,I'm sorry.
01:37:37.393,01:37:38.769,You've got to wash that hair.
01:38:04.420,01:38:05.754,What's wrong?
01:38:05.838,01:38:07.172,Nothing.
01:38:12.219,01:38:13.262,I love you.
01:38:26.775,01:38:29.236,Looks great. Thank you.
01:38:29.445,01:38:33.282,"Rhodes and I worked out a deal way back when, so it's on the house."
01:38:33.949,01:38:35.075,Are you serious?
01:38:35.284,01:38:37.578,Yeah. I owe him big time.
01:38:37.786,01:38:39.580,That's really nice.
01:38:46.962,01:38:48.255,"Hey, Mom?"
01:38:50.424,01:38:51.717,"This is my mom, Judy."
01:38:51.800,01:38:53.594,"Hey, how are you? Nice to meet you."
01:38:53.677,01:38:55.638,"Good to meet you, too."
01:38:56.805,01:38:58.807,"Wait a minute, don't I know you from AA?"
01:39:02.645,01:39:04.104,"It's good, huh?"
01:39:04.188,01:39:05.272,It's just delicious.
01:40:10.129,01:40:11.171,Come in.
01:40:15.718,01:40:17.803,Are you sure you're not gonna come with me today?
01:40:18.053,01:40:19.596,It's Lillian's big day.
01:40:19.680,01:40:21.432,"Mom, she doesn't want me there."
01:40:25.102,01:40:27.062,I'll fix you a tuna fish sandwich.
01:40:27.396,01:40:28.647,"Mom, it's 8:00 in the morning."
01:40:28.772,01:40:30.232,You can put syrup on it.
01:40:40.159,01:40:41.577,I know.
01:40:42.745,01:40:43.746,Hi.
01:40:44.079,01:40:45.122,What do you want?
01:40:45.289,01:40:47.374,I was wondering if you knew where Lillian was.
01:40:47.875,01:40:49.793,"No, why would I... What do you mean?"
01:40:50.127,01:40:52.755,I can't find her. We've looked everywhere.
01:40:52.838,01:40:53.881,What?
01:40:53.964,01:40:56.175,She's missing. Can you help?
01:40:56.675,01:41:00.262,"Okay, just wait here. I think I know someone that might be able to help."
01:41:00.345,01:41:02.514,-I'll get my keys. -Can I just use...
01:41:05.684,01:41:09.480,"I mean, I just don't know what could have possibly gone wrong."
01:41:09.563,01:41:11.190,Everything was going smoothly.
01:41:11.273,01:41:13.400,The dress looked fantastic. It had come in from Paris.
01:41:13.650,01:41:15.861,Dougie was being great and very helpful.
01:41:15.944,01:41:20.491,I had organized everything to the last final detail.
01:41:20.574,01:41:22.034,I just...
01:41:22.367,01:41:23.994,I don't know what's happened to her.
01:41:24.244,01:41:26.371,"I don't know. You should know, right?"
01:41:26.455,01:41:29.750,You're her best friend. It's weird that you don't know.
01:41:29.917,01:41:31.126,You guys are so close.
01:41:35.255,01:41:41.595,"Annie, I want to apologize to you personally for all of the things that have gone down."
01:41:41.678,01:41:46.058,"I know that I hurt you, and that I created a distance between you and Lillian."
01:41:46.141,01:41:47.976,-I want to apologize for that... -I don't want to hear it.
01:41:48.060,01:41:51.230,...and everything that happened at the shower. And with Las Vegas...
01:41:51.313,01:41:53.106,"Okay, I don't want to hear any more, honestly."
01:41:53.190,01:41:55.317,I don't even want to talk to you.
01:41:56.109,01:41:58.362,"Harry never really wants to talk to me, either."
01:41:58.445,01:42:01.156,"He travels a lot. Like, all year."
01:42:01.240,01:42:03.867,I'm basically just by myself.
01:42:03.951,01:42:06.995,I don't want to... I don't feel sorry for you.
01:42:08.038,01:42:11.625,I really liked that original dress you picked at the bridal store.
01:42:11.834,01:42:14.753,I thought it was beautiful. You have really lovely taste.
01:42:14.837,01:42:18.298,"Thanks, but it's a little too late for that."
01:42:18.465,01:42:19.591,And I know...
01:42:19.675,01:42:22.678,I don't think that Brazilian food really gave us food poisoning.
01:42:22.761,01:42:24.888,"-No, it did. -No, I don't think it did."
01:42:24.972,01:42:26.932,It was the food. I shit my pants on the way home.
01:42:27.015,01:42:28.475,I don't think it was your fault.
01:42:29.017,01:42:30.769,That was my fault.
01:42:31.645,01:42:37.109,I think people just ask me to their weddings because I'm good at organizing parties.
01:42:42.990,01:42:44.491,I'm so sorry.
01:42:44.867,01:42:46.994,"Why are you smiling, Annie?"
01:42:47.160,01:42:48.829,It's just... It's just...
01:42:48.996,01:42:51.415,This is the first time I've ever seen you look ugly.
01:42:51.582,01:42:53.375,And that makes me kind of happy.
01:42:54.084,01:42:57.462,"I look ugly? No, I don't. I don't really look ugly."
01:42:57.546,01:42:59.882,"A little bit. You're an ugly crier, but that's okay."
01:42:59.965,01:43:01.800,"No, I'm not really an ugly crier."
01:43:01.884,01:43:03.343,-Maybe just a little bit. -No.
01:43:03.510,01:43:04.845,Just a little bit.
01:43:05.721,01:43:07.681,It's just my makeup.
01:43:07.848,01:43:09.892,But I still look pretty good.
01:43:15.939,01:43:16.940,Rhodes.
01:43:17.691,01:43:18.984,Rhodes.
01:43:20.110,01:43:21.570,Come on! Rhodes!
01:43:21.820,01:43:23.322,"-He's ignoring you. Let me. -Yes, he is."
01:43:29.578,01:43:35.083,"Rhodes, I know you can hear me, and I know you're mad at me, but I need your help. Please!"
01:43:37.920,01:43:39.588,You know this guy?
01:43:48.764,01:43:49.848,What are you doing?
01:43:49.932,01:43:51.558,I just want to get his attention.
01:43:52.851,01:43:54.937,"Annie! Oh, my God."
01:44:01.777,01:44:05.530,"Annie, my hair! What are you doing?"
01:44:05.614,01:44:07.824,I'm speeding! You better pull me over!
01:44:11.036,01:44:12.079,Really?
01:44:12.245,01:44:14.081,Here comes the litter-bug!
01:44:18.585,01:44:20.504,Let's see what Marmaduke's doing.
01:44:20.796,01:44:23.298,Just texting. Talking on the phone while I'm driving.
01:44:23.382,01:44:25.842,"Not even using my hands. Oh, hi!"
01:44:27.970,01:44:28.971,Mmm! Yum! Yum!
01:44:29.137,01:44:31.348,Beer! Yum! Yum! Yum!
01:44:32.557,01:44:33.600,Idiot.
01:44:47.990,01:44:50.158,I don't care. I don't care.
01:44:55.664,01:44:58.291,"I'm going to hurl. I feel really sick, Annie!"
01:45:00.002,01:45:02.295,"Hey, who's driving that car?"
01:45:05.007,01:45:06.091,Can we go up now?
01:45:07.009,01:45:08.885,That's not clever.
01:45:10.387,01:45:11.888,I'm topless!
01:45:13.098,01:45:14.599,I'm totally topless.
01:45:24.276,01:45:25.485,Really?
01:45:27.529,01:45:29.448,Wow. Unbelievable.
01:45:29.698,01:45:31.408,What the fuck are you doing?
01:45:31.658,01:45:32.701,I don't know.
01:45:32.784,01:45:34.327,Hey! Are you crazy?
01:45:34.619,01:45:35.746,Are you crazy?
01:45:35.912,01:45:38.874,"All of that stuff, that would have been dangerous for a good driver."
01:45:38.957,01:45:41.960,I'm sorry. I just... I really need your help.
01:45:42.252,01:45:43.378,We can't find Lillian.
01:45:44.796,01:45:47.382,-How long has she been gone? -She's been missing for 12 hours.
01:45:47.549,01:45:48.842,Twelve hours?
01:45:49.009,01:45:51.344,It's not a missing person until it's at least 24 hours.
01:45:51.428,01:45:53.680,Have you ever seen CSI? 24 hours.
01:45:54.264,01:45:56.516,"Let me get on with my job, Annie."
01:45:56.683,01:45:59.394,"Nathan, please?"
01:45:59.561,01:46:00.645,I really need your help.
01:46:02.731,01:46:04.024,"Please, Nathan."
01:46:04.649,01:46:05.650,Who is this one?
01:46:06.068,01:46:07.152,-This is Helen. -I'm Helen.
01:46:07.319,01:46:09.821,-What? -It's Helen.
01:46:10.155,01:46:14.159,"Hello, Helen. I've heard wonderful things."
01:46:17.329,01:46:20.415,"Okay, thanks, buddy. Bye-bye."
01:46:20.582,01:46:23.919,"Okay, we've traced her cell phone to the corner of Craner and Rose."
01:46:24.753,01:46:26.088,Do you know where that is?
01:46:26.171,01:46:28.215,Yes. That is her apartment.
01:46:29.007,01:46:30.175,I thought you said you looked there.
01:46:30.342,01:46:32.552,-We did. We did. Last night. -Okay.
01:46:32.677,01:46:35.430,So you're saying she's at her apartment? That's what you're telling me?
01:46:37.349,01:46:38.642,"God, that was crazy of her."
01:46:38.934,01:46:41.478,-Thank God! Thank you. Let's go. Let's go. -Okay.
01:46:44.940,01:46:46.358,We found her!
01:46:50.112,01:46:52.781,I am so sorry. I didn't mean to waste your time.
01:46:52.864,01:46:54.658,That's embarrassing.
01:46:55.867,01:46:57.744,"-Thank you. -No, you are welcome."
01:46:57.828,01:47:02.040,It's this kind of high-octane stuff that really made me want to become a cop.
01:47:02.332,01:47:04.376,Missing girl found at her apartment.
01:47:04.459,01:47:05.877,It's...
01:47:06.211,01:47:08.171,It's adrenalin-pinching.
01:47:10.715,01:47:12.134,It's nice to see you.
01:47:16.179,01:47:18.974,I'm glad that you got your taillights fixed.
01:47:19.141,01:47:21.101,Means I won't have to stop you again.
01:47:25.981,01:47:27.023,Okay.
01:47:28.775,01:47:30.402,"Annie, let's go."
01:47:32.404,01:47:34.489,"Anyway, go and save your friend from her apartment."
01:47:35.115,01:47:36.366,Bye-bye.
01:47:36.449,01:47:37.784,Bye.
01:48:05.770,01:48:08.440,Do you mind actually if I go by myself?
01:48:10.192,01:48:12.068,-Sure. -Okay.
01:48:13.320,01:48:14.905,Lil?
01:48:16.072,01:48:17.532,Lillian?
01:48:19.367,01:48:20.368,Lil?
01:48:30.378,01:48:31.463,What happened?
01:48:34.466,01:48:37.594,This whole wedding is fucked up.
01:48:37.969,01:48:40.222,"Helen just took over everything, and..."
01:48:42.599,01:48:44.184,Everything just got out of control.
01:48:44.267,01:48:47.187,And my dad can't afford the wedding.
01:48:48.021,01:48:51.483,This has been really hard to do without you.
01:48:52.567,01:48:55.445,It's been shitty.
01:48:57.781,01:48:59.407,I'm sorry.
01:49:00.408,01:49:02.285,Nope. I'm sorry.
01:49:02.786,01:49:04.579,I'm sorry I kicked you out of my wedding.
01:49:06.414,01:49:07.499,It's my fault.
01:49:07.582,01:49:08.583,"No, it's my fault."
01:49:08.708,01:49:11.586,I think I'm the one with the mental problems.
01:49:11.670,01:49:14.381,"Yeah, wasn't it my turn to be crazy? The bride's supposed to be crazy."
01:49:14.464,01:49:15.507,"Yes, technically."
01:49:15.757,01:49:18.468,-You kind of stole all the crazy. -I out-crazied you.
01:49:20.762,01:49:22.180,Everything's going to be okay.
01:49:22.347,01:49:24.516,Yeah? How do you know that?
01:49:27.602,01:49:30.188,I left the rehearsal dinner last night.
01:49:30.355,01:49:32.440,I told Dougie I had to go get Q-tips.
01:49:32.607,01:49:34.025,And...
01:49:35.110,01:49:38.196,"All of a sudden, I realized I was driving here."
01:49:38.280,01:49:39.406,I came here.
01:49:41.992,01:49:53.295,"I realized this is the last time I'm going to be here in this apartment with that couch, and this bed, and take a bath in my bathtub."
01:49:53.461,01:49:55.297,Because you know how much I love my bathtub.
01:49:55.380,01:49:56.423,It's a good tub.
01:49:56.506,01:49:58.300,"I slept in there on my 30th birthday, remember?"
01:49:58.383,01:49:59.551,Uh-huh.
01:50:00.218,01:50:01.886,Everything's gonna change.
01:50:03.555,01:50:07.559,"I mean, I'm not going to get to live five minutes away from you."
01:50:10.603,01:50:12.314,And it makes me so sad.
01:50:16.818,01:50:17.944,"Well, don't be."
01:50:18.486,01:50:24.993,"Don't be sad. Because things are going to change, but they'll be better."
01:50:26.661,01:50:27.871,You know?
01:50:28.288,01:50:31.916,"You're gonna take this huge, great, beautiful step."
01:50:32.625,01:50:34.878,And Dougie loves you more than anything.
01:50:35.170,01:50:37.255,And so do I.
01:50:41.634,01:50:44.429,But what about you? What's gonna happen to you?
01:50:50.060,01:50:52.312,I'm gonna be fine.
01:50:54.731,01:50:57.484,"So don't worry, okay? I'm gonna be..."
01:50:57.650,01:50:59.235,I'm gonna be fine.
01:50:59.569,01:51:01.154,I am fine.
01:51:04.741,01:51:08.203,"And besides, you need to blaze the trail for me."
01:51:08.370,01:51:11.289,And then report back and tell me what's coming.
01:51:16.753,01:51:20.799,"All right, let's get your dress on, okay, and let's go to your wedding."
01:51:21.466,01:51:23.385,"Oh, yeah."
01:51:24.886,01:51:26.304,That's the other problem.
01:51:36.731,01:51:40.819,Don't you dare laugh.
01:51:48.743,01:51:49.786,Okay.
01:51:49.869,01:51:51.913,I cannot wear this dress!
01:51:52.163,01:51:53.706,"Okay, don't panic."
01:51:54.124,01:51:56.501,-Lil... -This is a nightmare.
01:51:57.335,01:51:58.420,We'll fix it.
01:51:58.503,01:52:00.046,We'll tweak it.
01:52:01.381,01:52:04.884,"I will not let you walk down that aisle unless you look perfect and beautiful, I promise."
01:52:05.051,01:52:08.513,Why? Do you have a chainsaw and a blowtorch?
01:52:11.099,01:52:13.393,I think this wedding is gonna be a disaster.
01:52:13.476,01:52:14.602,"No, don't say that."
01:52:14.894,01:52:20.608,"If Helen had anything to do with this wedding, it is going to be perfect and tasteful and beautiful."
01:52:20.692,01:52:21.693,That's true.
01:52:25.738,01:52:33.872,"Will you love her, comfort her, and keep her and, forsaking all others, remain true to her as long as you both shall live?"
01:52:33.955,01:52:34.956,I do.
01:52:37.959,01:52:41.754,"Will you love him, comfort him, and keep him as long as you both shall live?"
01:52:43.047,01:52:44.340,I do.
01:52:48.344,01:52:50.096,I pronounce you husband and wife.
01:52:50.638,01:52:51.723,You may now kiss the bride.
01:53:02.609,01:53:08.740,"Ladies and gentlemen, here with us tonight is Lillian's favorite band singing her favorite song."
01:53:08.823,01:53:13.036,Put your hands together for Wilson Phillips!
01:53:17.332,01:53:18.333,"Hi, everybody!"
01:53:20.835,01:53:22.086,How we doing tonight?
01:53:22.629,01:53:24.547,I am not paying for this shit.
01:53:26.674,01:53:27.884,Really?
01:53:29.594,01:53:30.929,"It's the last one, I promise."
01:53:31.012,01:53:32.764,-It's not the last one. -It's the last one.
01:55:25.001,01:55:26.961,What's so funny?
01:55:27.462,01:55:31.174,I put a loaded gun in Dougie's carry-on.
01:55:32.008,01:55:35.887,The TSA is going to just rip his ass apart.
01:55:41.643,01:55:42.644,Oh. Hey.
01:55:46.814,01:55:48.691,Did you have a nice evening?
01:55:48.775,01:55:50.777,It was beautiful. Yeah.
01:55:51.235,01:55:53.321,What did you think of the wedding?
01:55:54.113,01:55:55.531,It was...
01:55:55.823,01:55:56.866,It was great.
01:55:57.033,01:55:58.159,"-It was great, right? -Yeah."
01:55:58.326,01:55:59.535,It was perfect.
01:56:00.703,01:56:03.373,"-It was great. -Yeah, it was great."
01:56:06.334,01:56:08.336,It was really nice meeting you.
01:56:09.253,01:56:10.922,"Yeah, it was..."
01:56:11.089,01:56:13.758,"Helen, it was really nice meeting you, too."
01:56:17.845,01:56:23.184,"Hey, you know, maybe sometime the three of us could go to Rockin' Sushi together."
01:56:25.019,01:56:27.855,"Thank you, Annie."
01:56:28.022,01:56:29.732,I would love that.
01:56:36.072,01:56:37.991,Your ride's here.
01:56:54.465,01:56:56.426,"Hey, how did everything go?"
01:56:58.386,01:57:00.638,"-Strangely well. -Oh, good."
01:57:03.891,01:57:07.979,"So, I ate your cake that you left."
01:57:08.062,01:57:09.063,-You did? -Yeah.
01:57:09.313,01:57:10.732,"I mean, I had to fight some raccoons off."
01:57:11.482,01:57:15.987,"But that's okay. I'm pretty strong and tough, so it wasn't much of a contest."
01:57:16.237,01:57:17.321,So that might have been...
01:57:17.405,01:57:18.740,I'm just going to kiss you now rather than just...
01:57:31.753,01:57:33.171,"Officer Rhodes, please report to..."
01:57:33.254,01:57:34.255,Oh! I'm on duty.
01:57:35.089,01:57:36.716,And I need to put my uniform on.
01:57:36.799,01:57:40.011,"If I drive like this, they're gonna think I just stole the car, which wouldn't be great."
01:57:41.262,01:57:43.806,You could ride with me if you want.
01:57:43.890,01:57:45.767,"-You want to come? -Yeah, I do."
01:57:45.850,01:57:47.977,-Come on. -All right.
01:57:48.269,01:57:50.480,-Whoa! Whoa! Where are you going? -I'm getting in the car.
01:57:50.563,01:57:52.231,"-No, no, no, you got to get in the back. -What?"
01:57:52.398,01:57:54.358,"You can't sit in the front, it's against regulations."
01:57:54.442,01:57:56.569,Come on. Come on.
01:57:56.903,01:57:58.613,You're going to make me sit in the back seat?
01:57:58.780,01:58:00.073,"Yeah, come on."
01:58:01.574,01:58:04.160,-All right. -It's a force of habit.
01:58:17.256,01:58:19.133,consuming alcohol while operating a vehicle.
01:58:19.300,01:58:22.637,"You didn't think I was going to let you get away with that, did you?"
01:58:27.517,01:58:28.893,Thank you.
01:59:07.849,01:59:09.183,Okay. Um...
01:59:10.601,01:59:13.646,This is Tape 119.
01:59:14.397,01:59:17.984,Air Marshall Jon and I's first sexual encounter.
01:59:18.192,01:59:19.777,Is there a hungry bear anywhere?
01:59:20.027,01:59:21.362,I'm a hungry bear.
01:59:21.529,01:59:23.698,I just happen to have this bear sandwich.
01:59:23.781,01:59:26.159,-Is there a hungry bear? -I'm a very hungry bear.
01:59:26.284,01:59:27.910,Did you see how my flap opens?
01:59:28.035,01:59:30.872,"Yeah, that's a good-looking bear sandwich."
01:59:30.955,01:59:32.665,"Yeah, that's a big bear sandwich."
01:59:32.748,01:59:34.584,-Do you want a bite of that sandwich? -Feed me.
01:59:34.667,01:59:36.210,It's meat and cheeses.
