00:00:40.833,00:00:43.293,"How old are you now, Scott?"
00:00:43.293,00:00:45.170,"I'm not playing your little games, kids."
00:00:45.170,00:00:48.089,"So, you've been out of high school for, like, 13 years."
00:00:48.089,00:00:50.217,I'm 22.
00:00:50.217,00:00:52.177,Twenty-two.

00:01:01.436,00:01:03.981,We have done many things.
00:01:03.981,00:01:06.358,We ride the bus together.
00:01:06.358,00:01:09.737,And we have meaningful conversations about how Yearbook Club went...
00:01:09.737,00:01:12.865,"and about her friends and, uh, you know, drama."
00:01:12.865,00:01:14.825,Have you even kissed her?
00:01:14.825,00:01:17.118,"We almost held hands once, but then she got embarrassed."
00:01:17.118,00:01:20.080,- Aren't you pleased as punch?
00:01:20.080,00:01:24.001,"- So, what's her name?"
00:01:24.001,00:01:27.295,She's Chinese.
00:01:27.295,00:01:29.631,- Wicked.
00:01:29.631,00:01:31.592,"Oh, please, let it be soon."

00:01:51.820,00:01:53.906,"I mean, I want her to geek out on us."
00:01:53.906,00:01:56.784,She'll geek. She geeks.

00:02:26.772,00:02:33.028,"Wow. Um, Zelda, Tetris."
00:02:33.028,00:02:34.947,That's kind of a big question.
00:02:34.947,00:02:37.783,"- Okay, let's start with Launchpad McQuack."
00:02:37.783,00:02:41.703,"Uh, that's not the actual title of the so-- We are Sex Bob-Omb!"
00:02:41.703,00:02:44.081,"One, two, three, four!"
00:03:44.725,00:03:47.186,Whoo!

00:04:51.083,00:04:53.293,"- Yeah, she seems awesome."
00:04:53.293,00:04:55.837,"Scott, if your life had a face, I would punch it."
00:04:55.837,00:04:58.006,Yeah.
00:04:58.006,00:05:00.968,"I mean, are you really happy, or are you really evil?"
00:05:00.968,00:05:03.637,"Like, do I have ulterior motives or something?"
00:05:03.637,00:05:05.931,"- I'm offended, Kim."
00:05:05.931,00:05:09.017,"- Hurt, Kim."
00:05:09.017,00:05:12.562,"Neil, you were saying about she seems awesome?"
00:05:12.562,00:05:14.355,"Yeah, she seems awesome."
00:05:14.355,00:05:15.774,Yeah.
00:05:20.070,00:05:24.449,"Before you hear some dirty lies from someone else, yes, I'm dating a 17-year-old."
00:05:24.449,00:05:26.910,Aw! Is he cute?
00:05:26.910,00:05:29.537,Does this mean we have to stop sleeping together?
00:05:29.537,00:05:31.748,You see another bed in here?
00:05:31.748,00:05:34.960,"Oh, yeah."
00:05:43.218,00:05:48.890,"So, the whole 17-year-old thing-- don't tell too many people."
00:05:48.890,00:05:51.143,"I mean, don't tell my sister."
00:05:51.143,00:05:53.228,You know me.
00:05:53.228,00:05:56.231,- Who are you texting?
00:05:57.482,00:05:59.400,Seventeen years old?
00:05:59.400,00:06:01.945,That's not true.
00:06:01.945,00:06:03.947,That gossipy bitch.
00:06:03.947,00:06:05.782,Wallace!
00:06:05.782,00:06:09.619,Who is this mystery child you date?
00:06:09.619,00:06:14.208,She's Chinese.
00:06:14.208,00:06:17.127,You're ridiculous.
00:06:17.127,00:06:19.796,With the uniform and everything?
00:06:19.796,00:06:23.382,"Oh, my God."
00:06:23.382,00:06:25.426,We haven't even held hands yet.
00:06:25.426,00:06:27.512,I think she hugged me once.
00:06:27.512,00:06:29.597,"Scott, why are you doing this?"
00:06:29.597,00:06:33.310,I don't know.
00:06:33.310,00:06:42.110,"It's been over a year since you got dumped by She-Who-Will-Not-Be-Named, so-- Are you legitimately moving on, or is this just you being insane?"
00:06:42.110,00:06:43.820,Can I get back to you on that?
00:06:46.907,00:06:50.827,I do not want to be here at all.
00:06:50.827,00:06:52.954,I hate you.
00:06:52.954,00:06:55.332,Even I would think twice about dating a 17-year-old.
00:06:55.332,00:06:58.752,"Well, she's only allowed out when the sun is up, so I wouldn't call it dating."
00:06:58.752,00:07:01.129,- It's more like-- - Playtime?
00:07:01.129,00:07:03.257,- That doesn't sound so good either.
00:07:03.257,00:07:05.633,- Scott!
00:07:05.633,00:07:08.136,"This is my cool, gay roommate, Wallace Wells."
00:07:08.136,00:07:11.848,- He's gay.
00:07:11.848,00:07:15.810,- Yes. Does he wear glasses?
00:07:18.188,00:07:20.899,You're too good for him.
00:07:31.076,00:07:34.788,Did you know that the original name for Pac-Man was Puck-Man?
00:07:34.788,00:07:37.832,"You would think it was because he looks like a hockey puck, but it actually comes..."
00:07:37.832,00:07:42.170,"from the Japanese phrase paku-pak, which means to flap one's mouth open and closed."
00:07:42.170,00:07:45.548,They changed it because they thought that Puck-Man would be too easy to vandalize.
00:07:45.548,00:07:49.219,"You know, people could just scratch off the P and turn it into an F or whatever."
00:07:49.219,00:07:52.389,"Oh, my God! Like, wow!"
00:07:52.389,00:07:53.807,Combo!
00:07:57.394,00:07:59.562,- Yeah.
00:07:59.562,00:08:03.483,- Wow.
00:07:59.562,00:08:06.445,"- Nine, eight, seven, six, - five, four, three, two, one."
00:08:11.450,00:08:13.534,I don't listen to that much music.
00:08:13.534,00:08:19.374,"I mean, I know a lot of kids who play piano or whatever, but you guys-- You guys rock."
00:08:19.374,00:08:23.753,"I knew I personally rocked, but I never suspected that we rocked as a unit."
00:08:23.753,00:08:25.464,"So thank you, Knives."
00:08:25.464,00:08:29.134,"I mean, you guys are gonna be huge."
00:08:29.134,00:08:33.013,"But yeah, I guess it'd be cool if cool people started wearing our T-shirt or whatever."
00:08:33.013,00:08:35.056,Cool.
00:08:35.056,00:08:38.435,"Um, excuse me."
00:08:38.435,00:08:41.771,Have you tried the section marked The Clash at Demonhead?
00:08:41.771,00:08:43.898,"Thank you, Julie."
00:08:43.898,00:08:47.819,"Are you coming to my party Friday, or will you be busy..."
00:08:47.819,00:08:50.238,"Thank you, Julie."
00:08:50.238,00:08:52.282,You don't wanna listen to her.
00:08:52.282,00:08:55.118,And you definitely don't wanna listen to them.
00:08:55.118,00:08:57.329,"Oh, I heart them so much."
00:08:57.329,00:09:04.252,"Yeah, I hearted them, too, until they signed to a major label, and the lead singer turned into a total bitch and ruined my life forever."
00:09:04.252,00:09:05.920,But that's just me.
00:09:05.920,00:09:08.340,Envy Adams is so cool.
00:09:08.340,00:09:11.468,Do you read her blog?
00:09:11.468,00:09:14.012,"I mean, I've never gone out with anyone so talented."
00:09:14.012,00:09:16.431,You go out with a lot of guys?
00:09:16.431,00:09:18.850,No.
00:09:18.850,00:09:20.852,I've never even kissed a guy.
00:09:24.189,00:09:26.316,Hey.
00:09:26.316,00:09:27.817,Me neither.
00:09:39.704,00:09:41.581,Here you go.
00:09:41.581,00:09:43.791,So this is your secret lair?
00:09:43.791,00:09:46.044,Can I come in?
00:09:46.044,00:09:49.423,My secret lair is one of those no girls allowed-type deals.
00:09:49.423,00:09:52.592,"Oh, okay."
00:09:52.592,00:09:54.219,Sure.
00:09:55.845,00:09:57.556,There you go.
00:09:58.932,00:10:01.851,Wow.
00:10:01.851,00:10:03.937,Yeah. Wow.
00:10:11.694,00:10:13.405,"Oh, God."
00:10:15.782,00:10:17.075,So alone.
00:10:19.119,00:10:21.580,You're not alone.
00:10:21.580,00:10:24.124,You're just having some idiotic dream.
00:10:25.459,00:10:27.377,Does that mean we can make out?
00:10:27.377,00:10:29.296,"Oh, God!"
00:10:29.296,00:10:31.881,"What is it, Scott?"
00:10:31.881,00:10:34.509,"Oh, God!"
00:10:34.509,00:10:37.804,Can we skip the dream time?
00:10:37.804,00:10:39.680,But there was this girl.
00:10:39.680,00:10:42.100,Girl?
00:10:42.100,00:10:44.727,We don't use the E-word in this house.
00:10:44.727,00:10:46.854,It was somebody new.
00:10:46.854,00:10:49.232,Yay for that.
00:10:49.232,00:10:51.901,"Speaking of new, weren't you supposed to take your fake high school girlfriend..."
00:10:51.901,00:10:54.613,- to the library a half hour ago?
00:10:54.613,00:10:56.656,"It's, like, 6:00 in the morning."
00:10:59.367,00:11:01.995,Shh!
00:11:01.995,00:11:04.038,What's weird?
00:11:04.038,00:11:06.666,Libraries remind me of grade school.
00:11:06.666,00:11:09.336,That must seem like a really long time ago.
00:11:09.336,00:11:11.754,Yeah. Let's talk about something else.
00:11:30.148,00:11:33.401,Do you know that girl?
00:11:33.401,00:11:35.570,Scott!
00:11:35.570,00:11:38.239,You only played one note for that entire song.
00:11:38.239,00:11:40.200,My hand slipped.
00:11:40.200,00:11:42.327,Is your girlfriend distracting you?
00:11:42.327,00:11:45.288,- My girlfriend? Wh-- - I'll be quieter.
00:11:45.288,00:11:47.999,Let's do that one again.
00:11:47.999,00:11:50.627,- Sorry. What are we doing?
00:11:50.627,00:11:53.171,"We're going to this party, retard."
00:11:53.171,00:11:55.590,At Julie's.
00:11:55.590,00:12:00.428,"We did, but there might be some label guys there, so, you know-- Oh, man!"
00:12:00.428,00:12:02.347,At least it'll give us something to complain about.
00:12:02.347,00:12:03.890,"Oh, man!"
00:12:03.890,00:12:06.059,This sucks!
00:12:06.059,00:12:08.144,I'm gonna go pee due to boredom.
00:12:09.396,00:12:11.231,I have to pee.
00:12:11.231,00:12:18.363,"So I told him, you've got a really good sound, and I think that you should market your sound to deaf people because-- Scott, hey."
00:12:18.363,00:12:20.365,"How 'bout this party, huh?"
00:12:20.365,00:12:22.701,"No, I don't drink."
00:12:22.701,00:12:26.037,What do you mean? I distinctly remember you being very drunk on a couple of G-and-T's.
00:12:26.037,00:12:27.997,"Hey, Comeau."
00:12:27.997,00:12:29.874,"Yeah, pretty much, I do."
00:12:29.874,00:12:31.710,You know this one girl with hair like this?
00:12:31.710,00:12:33.336,"Yes, that's Ramona Flowers."
00:12:33.336,00:12:35.296,"Somebody said she was gonna be here tonight, actually."
00:12:35.296,00:12:37.507,- What?
00:12:37.507,00:12:40.134,I gotta tell you though.
00:13:21.884,00:13:24.721,"Hey, what's up?"
00:13:24.721,00:13:27.890,"Hey, you know Pac-Man?"
00:13:27.890,00:13:30.977,"Well, Pac-Man was originally called Puck-Man."
00:13:32.186,00:13:36.524,"They changed it because-- uh, not because Pac-Man looks like a hockey puck."
00:13:36.524,00:13:48.911,"Paku-paku means flap your mouth, and they were afraid people would change-- scratch out the P, turn it into an F, like-- Yeah. That's amazing."
00:13:48.911,00:13:52.831,Uh-- am I dreaming?
00:13:55.376,00:13:57.962,I'll leave you alone forever now.
00:14:05.052,00:14:06.262,Dude!
00:14:06.262,00:14:07.888,She's totally real!
00:14:07.888,00:14:09.557,Ramona Flowers.
00:14:09.557,00:14:11.685,Dude! What do you know about Ramona Flowers?
00:14:11.685,00:14:14.479,All I know is that she is American.
00:14:14.479,00:14:17.231,Why don't you go talk to Sandra and Monique?
00:14:17.231,00:14:19.359,Lady dudes.
00:14:19.359,00:14:22.320,I heard she has a boyfriend.
00:14:22.320,00:14:24.030,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:14:24.030,00:14:26.491,I heard she kicks all kinds of ass.
00:14:26.491,00:14:29.160,She's on another level.
00:14:29.160,00:14:31.078,She has men dying at her feet.
00:14:31.078,00:14:33.832,"She's got some battle scars, dude."
00:14:33.832,00:14:36.710,- What about Ramona Flowers?
00:14:36.710,00:14:39.170,She just moved here.
00:14:39.170,00:14:41.673,- Does she really?
00:14:41.673,00:14:44.634,- Did she really?
00:14:44.634,00:14:47.804,- Did they really?
00:14:47.804,00:14:50.056,"Yeah, I don't know what it is about that girl."
00:14:50.056,00:14:55.895,"Scott, I forbid you from hitting on Ramona, even if you haven't had a real girlfriend in over a year."
00:14:55.895,00:14:58.857,"Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
00:14:58.857,00:15:00.775,He's totally dating a high schooler.
00:15:00.775,00:15:03.903,Dating a high schooler is the mourning period.
00:15:03.903,00:15:07.948,- I thought you guys broke up.
00:15:07.948,00:15:10.702,We all know you're a total lady-killer-wannabe jerky-jerk.
00:15:10.702,00:15:13.162,- That's completely untrue.
00:15:13.162,00:15:15.039,- That was a misunderstanding.
00:15:15.039,00:15:17.542,- That wasn't what it looked like.
00:15:15.039,00:15:21.087,"- That time you dumped Kim for-- Okay, me and Kim are all good now, all right?"
00:15:21.087,00:15:24.048,Whatever!
00:15:24.048,00:15:26.300,"Besides, I'm not even sure she did have a big breakup."
00:15:26.300,00:15:28.469,She keeps mentioning some guy named Gideon.
00:15:28.469,00:15:31.472,- Yeah. I don't know what it is about that girl.
00:15:34.975,00:15:37.604,Guess who's drunk!
00:15:37.604,00:15:41.065,I guess Wallace.
00:15:44.694,00:15:47.447,"So that girl from my dream-- Mmm, girl. Okay."
00:15:47.447,00:15:49.949,I saw her at the library.
00:15:49.949,00:15:51.992,Can I pretend we're talking about a guy?
00:15:51.992,00:15:54.871,"And then I'm at this party, and, hey, there she is."
00:15:54.871,00:15:57.081,"Hey, there he is."
00:15:54.871,00:16:00.627,I think she's-- I think he's-- I think she's the girl of my dreams.
00:16:00.627,00:16:03.797,Mmm. Then you should break up with your fake high school girlfriend.
00:16:03.797,00:16:06.048,I've never been so sure about something.
00:16:06.048,00:16:08.175,Then you should break up with your fake high school girlfriend.
00:16:08.175,00:16:12.680,- What's that?
00:16:12.680,00:16:15.349,"- I'm not getting it, friend."
00:16:15.349,00:16:18.394,You're thinking of juggling two chicks?
00:16:18.394,00:16:20.814,"Well, you should break up with your fake high school girlfriend."
00:16:20.814,00:16:23.107,"Wait, who told you?"
00:16:23.107,00:16:25.109,He's not even conscious.
00:16:25.109,00:16:27.904,"You, of all people, should know how sucky it is to get cheated on."
00:16:27.904,00:16:29.989,Don't you have a job to do?
00:16:29.989,00:16:32.283,I should send out a mass text about this. Bye.
00:16:34.494,00:16:37.163,"Wallace, how do you do that?"
00:16:37.163,00:16:38.957,Wallace!
00:16:38.957,00:16:41.459,Amazon.ca-- What's the Web site for that?
00:16:41.459,00:16:44.003,Amazon.ca.
00:16:44.003,00:16:46.631,I have to order something really cool.
00:16:46.631,00:16:49.425,"Dude, this thing claims I have mail."
00:16:49.425,00:16:51.970,It's amazing what we can do with computers these days.
00:16:51.970,00:16:55.890,"- Dude, now I'm reading it."
00:16:55.890,00:16:59.059,"Dear Mr. Pilgrim, It has come to my attention that we will be fighting soon."
00:16:59.059,00:17:04.106,"My name is Matthew Patel and-- Blah, blah, blah, blah, b-- Fair warning."
00:17:04.106,00:17:05.859,Mano a mano.
00:17:05.859,00:17:07.986,"Seven evil-- Blah, blah."
00:17:07.986,00:17:14.951,This is-- This is-- - This is-- - What?
00:17:14.951,00:17:16.703,This is boring.
00:17:16.703,00:17:18.788,Delete.
00:17:22.959,00:17:27.171,"Scott, are you waiting for the package you just ordered?"
00:17:27.171,00:17:29.549,- Maybe.
00:17:29.549,00:17:32.218,It won't ship until Monday at the earliest.
00:17:32.218,00:17:34.679,You were saying?
00:17:34.679,00:17:37.264,Attack hug!
00:17:37.264,00:17:40.018,That's so cute.
00:17:40.018,00:17:42.603,You were supposed to meet me at the bus stop a half hour ago.
00:17:42.603,00:17:45.272,How could I possibly forget?
00:17:47.400,00:17:50.987,Yearbook Club is so boring.
00:17:50.987,00:17:52.947,That's sucky.
00:17:52.947,00:17:55.616,"Ooh! Hannah broke up with Alan, and now she's all into Derek."
00:17:55.616,00:17:58.786,But then Tamara claims she has dibs on Derek.
00:18:00.538,00:18:02.707,Bad! Bad!
00:18:04.124,00:18:05.710,Bad!
00:18:07.169,00:18:08.838,Bad!
00:18:08.838,00:18:11.716,"Oh, okay. I'm sorry."
00:18:11.716,00:18:14.552,- Solo round!
00:18:14.552,00:18:18.514,Nega ninja.
00:18:18.514,00:18:20.641,I can never get past that guy.
00:18:20.641,00:18:23.102,Don't beat yourself up about it.
00:18:23.102,00:18:26.105,- Game over!
00:18:26.105,00:18:27.815,Um-- Continue?
00:18:27.815,00:18:36.532,"Nine, eight, seven, six-- I think-- five, four-- I think-- three, two, one."
00:18:33.654,00:18:46.292,"we should, uh-- Game on, everybody."
00:18:46.292,00:18:48.878,- I got us a show.
00:18:48.878,00:18:50.337,Wednesday.
00:18:50.337,00:18:53.091,The Rockit.
00:18:53.091,00:18:55.760,- Whoa.
00:18:55.760,00:18:59.513,"That's right. This guy I work with was, like, Steve, you know anybody in a band?"
00:18:59.513,00:19:01.641,"And I was, like, I'm in a band."
00:19:01.641,00:19:03.434,"And he was, like, You're in a band?"
00:19:03.434,00:19:05.519,"And I was, like, Yeah, I am totally in a band."
00:19:05.519,00:19:07.981,"- Great story, man."
00:19:07.981,00:19:11.150,- Only a record deal with G-man Graves.
00:19:11.150,00:19:13.486,- Who's that?
00:19:13.486,00:19:16.614,- Indie producer of the millennium?
00:19:16.614,00:19:21.035,"If we win, it won't just be Knives wearing Sex Bob-Omb shirts."
00:19:21.035,00:19:23.913,It'll be the cool kids too.
00:19:23.913,00:19:28.751,I promise I will do everything I can to get out of the study group and come.
00:19:28.751,00:19:31.754,I have to pee.
00:19:31.754,00:19:33.547,"Oh, my gosh!"
00:19:33.547,00:19:35.508,Crash and the Boys.
00:19:35.508,00:19:37.927,That one band with Crash and those boys?
00:19:37.927,00:19:40.138,"Yeah, that's the one."
00:19:40.138,00:19:42.849,I hate them too.
00:19:42.849,00:19:44.224,They suck bad.
00:19:55.736,00:19:57.446,Uh-- Huh?
00:20:10.626,00:20:12.419,Hey!
00:20:21.261,00:20:22.429,Hey!
00:20:26.475,00:20:28.811,"Uh, Scott Pilgrim?"
00:20:28.811,00:20:32.106,"Hi. I was thinking about asking you out, but then I realized how stupid that would be."
00:20:32.106,00:20:33.858,"So, do you want to go out sometime?"
00:20:33.858,00:20:37.111,"Um, no, that's okay."
00:20:37.111,00:20:39.113,"I just woke up, and you were in my dream."
00:20:39.113,00:20:42.116,I dreamt that you were delivering me this package.
00:20:42.116,00:20:45.078,It's not weird at all.
00:20:45.078,00:20:48.330,You just have this convenient subspace highway running through your head that I like to use.
00:20:48.330,00:20:50.499,"It's, like, three miles in 15 seconds."
00:20:50.499,00:20:53.544,I forgot you guys don't have that in Canada.
00:20:53.544,00:20:56.130,We met at the party the other day.
00:20:56.130,00:20:59.425,No. Not even.
00:20:59.425,00:21:03.012,I was the other guy.
00:21:03.012,00:21:05.472,"But if I sign for it, you'll leave."
00:21:05.472,00:21:08.601,"Okay. Well, maybe, do you wanna hang out sometime?"
00:21:08.601,00:21:10.477,Get to know each other?
00:21:10.477,00:21:12.479,"You're the new kid on the block, right?"
00:21:12.479,00:21:17.818,"I've lived here forever, so there are reasons for you to hang out with me."
00:21:17.818,00:21:20.696,You want me to hang out with you?
00:21:20.696,00:21:23.824,"Um, yeah, if that's cool."
00:21:23.824,00:21:26.368,"If I say yes, will you sign for your damn package?"
00:21:28.704,00:21:30.081,So yeah. 8:00?
00:21:33.500,00:21:35.086,Why are you just standing there?
00:21:35.086,00:21:38.131,"Dude, I'm totally waiting on you."
00:21:38.131,00:21:41.759,I just assumed you were too cool to be here on time.
00:21:42.969,00:21:45.471,"So, how'd you end up in Toronto?"
00:21:45.471,00:21:48.474,"Just needed to escape, I guess."
00:21:48.474,00:21:54.521,"I got this job here, and Gideon had always said Toronto was one of the great cities, so-- Is Gideon your boyfriend?"
00:21:54.521,00:21:58.859,He's... a friend.
00:21:58.859,00:22:02.822,Was he your boyfriend?
00:22:02.822,00:22:05.407,"Oh, it's so not interesting to me."
00:22:05.407,00:22:08.119,So what about you?
00:22:08.119,00:22:10.746,"Oh, I'm in between jobs at the moment."
00:22:10.746,00:22:12.748,Between what and what?
00:22:12.748,00:22:17.753,"Well, my last job was a long story filled with sighs."
00:22:17.753,00:22:19.880,I know plenty of those.
00:22:19.880,00:22:22.883,Is that why you left New York?
00:22:22.883,00:22:25.511,It was just time to head somewhere a little more chilled.
00:22:25.511,00:22:28.014,"Well, it's certainly chilled here."
00:22:28.014,00:22:30.766,"It's chilled, as in cold."
00:22:30.766,00:22:32.476,Yeah.
00:22:34.436,00:22:38.482,This is ridiculous.
00:22:38.482,00:22:40.943,I know.
00:22:40.943,00:22:43.737,This whole thing is an unmitigated disaster.
00:22:43.737,00:22:47.658,I think act of God is a pretty decent excuse for a lousy date.
00:22:47.658,00:22:49.618,"So this is a date, eh?"
00:22:49.618,00:22:51.662,Did I say date?
00:22:51.662,00:22:53.622,Slip of the tongue.
00:22:53.622,00:22:55.541,Tongue.
00:22:55.541,00:22:58.044,"Anyway, night's not over yet."
00:22:58.044,00:23:01.005,I think there's a thingy over here somewhere.
00:23:01.964,00:23:03.757,A door.
00:23:05.634,00:23:08.179,Come on.
00:23:22.609,00:23:25.445,What kind of tea do you want?
00:23:25.445,00:23:27.323,There's more than one kind?
00:23:27.323,00:23:40.627,"We have blueberry, raspberry, ginseng, Sleepytime, green tea, green tea with lemon, green tea with lemon and honey, liver disaster, ginger with honey, ginger without honey, vanilla almond, white truffle, blueberry chamomile, vanilla walnut, Constant Comment and Earl Grey."
00:23:40.627,00:23:43.381,Did you make some of those up?
00:23:43.381,00:23:45.132,I think I'll have Sleepytime.
00:23:45.132,00:23:46.842,That sounds good to me.
00:23:49.136,00:23:53.224,-Want me to get you a blanket?
00:24:01.648,00:24:05.111,"Dude, I'm changing."
00:24:05.111,00:24:08.155,Ah! Sorry.
00:24:08.155,00:24:10.741,Here. Does that help?
00:24:10.741,00:24:13.035,"Yeah, that's very warm."
00:24:13.035,00:24:15.579,Okay.
00:24:31.387,00:24:34.723,Were you just gonna bring the blanket from your bed?
00:24:34.723,00:24:36.225,I guess.
00:24:36.225,00:24:38.978,Maybe we should both get under it...
00:24:38.978,00:24:42.022,since we're so cold.
00:24:42.022,00:24:43.774,What about our tea?
00:24:46.026,00:24:48.279,I can...
00:24:48.279,00:24:50.323,not have tea.
00:24:58.038,00:24:59.873,I changed my mind.
00:24:59.873,00:25:02.626,Changed it to what?
00:25:02.626,00:25:06.130,"I don't wanna have sex with you, Pilgrim."
00:25:06.130,00:25:08.174,Okay.
00:25:08.174,00:25:10.717,It's not like I'm gonna send you home in a snowstorm or anything.
00:25:10.717,00:25:12.594,You can sleep in my bed.
00:25:12.594,00:25:14.972,And I reserve the right to change my mind about the sex later.
00:25:14.972,00:25:16.849,"Well, this is nice."
00:25:16.849,00:25:18.809,Just this.
00:25:18.809,00:25:22.980,"It's been, like, a really long time, so I think I needed this."
00:25:22.980,00:25:25.816,Whatever it is.
00:25:27.818,00:25:30.321,You're welcome.
00:25:32.448,00:25:35.993,"Hey, so, can this not be a one-night stand?"
00:25:35.993,00:25:38.454,"For one thing, I didn't even get any."
00:25:39.872,00:25:42.124,What did you have in mind?
00:25:42.124,00:25:45.336,Come to the first round of this Battle of the Bands thing.
00:25:45.336,00:25:48.797,Yeah. We're terrible.
00:25:48.797,00:25:51.509,"Oh, wait!"
00:25:53.469,00:25:55.971,Wow! Girl number.
00:25:55.971,00:25:58.474,"See you at the show, Scott Pilgrim."
00:25:58.474,00:26:01.477,"Oh, hey!"
00:25:58.474,00:26:06.440,"It's tonight, at the Ro-- Hey!"
00:26:06.440,00:26:10.652,- You totally came.
00:26:14.698,00:26:16.950,Please excuse my brother.
00:26:16.950,00:26:20.246,He is chronically enfeebled.
00:26:20.246,00:26:21.914,"This is Wallace, his roommate."
00:26:21.914,00:26:24.958,"- This is my boyfriend, Jimmy."
00:26:24.958,00:26:27.169,"Oh, and this is Knives."
00:26:27.169,00:26:28.546,Hey!
00:26:32.590,00:26:35.094,"So, do you like?"
00:26:35.094,00:26:49.900,"Well, I, uh-- have to go."
00:26:52.319,00:26:59.118,"Okay, this next band is from Brampton, and they are Crash and the Boys."
00:26:59.118,00:27:02.746,"Oh, man. Oh, God!"
00:27:02.746,00:27:05.458,Is this a nightmare?
00:27:05.458,00:27:07.460,"Once we're on stage, you'll be fine."
00:27:07.460,00:27:10.463,"We were just on stage for sound check, and the sound guy hated us."
00:27:10.463,00:27:13.631,"It's just nerves, preshow jitters."
00:27:13.631,00:27:16.302,"- People love us, right?"
00:27:16.302,00:27:18.845,"This is so, so bad."
00:27:18.845,00:27:22.141,"Hey, Jimmy, do they rock or suck?"
00:27:22.141,00:27:26.186,They have not started playing yet.
00:27:26.186,00:27:28.355,"That was a test, Jimmy."
00:27:28.355,00:27:31.649,You passed.
00:27:31.649,00:27:35.237,Good evening.
00:27:35.237,00:27:37.990,- Is that girl a boy too?
00:27:39.699,00:27:41.827,They have a girl drummer?
00:27:41.827,00:27:45.872,"This song is called, I Am So Sad, I Am So Very, Very Sad."
00:27:45.872,00:27:48.375,Goes a little something like this.
00:27:53.880,00:27:57.510,- Thank you.
00:27:57.510,00:28:00.929,All right. This next song goes out to the guy who keeps yelling from the balcony.
00:28:00.929,00:28:02.931,"It's called We Hate You, Please Die."
00:28:02.931,00:28:04.933,Sweet! Love this one.
00:28:17.988,00:28:20.824,How are we supposed to follow this?
00:28:20.824,00:28:24.328,We're not going to win.
00:28:24.328,00:28:27.581,We'll never play opening night at the Chaos Theatre.
00:28:27.581,00:28:30.250,"Goddamn it, Scott!"
00:28:30.250,00:28:32.044,You're freaking me out!
00:28:32.044,00:28:34.046,Thank you.
00:28:34.046,00:28:38.758,"So, how do you know Scott?"
00:28:38.758,00:28:41.761,He's a friend.
00:28:41.761,00:28:45.683,"It's hard for me to keep track sometimes, 'cause he has so many friends."
00:28:46.975,00:28:48.810,Knives...
00:28:48.810,00:28:51.564,"- Uh, how did you meet Scott?"
00:28:48.810,00:28:53.482,"- Well-- Oh, no."
00:28:55.275,00:28:58.028,This is a nightmare.
00:28:59.988,00:29:03.158,- We need to play now and loud.
00:29:03.158,00:29:07.079,"So, I was on the bus with my mom."
00:29:08.455,00:29:10.624,Is that seriously the end of the story?
00:29:10.624,00:29:13.168,"Oh, my gosh!"
00:29:13.168,00:29:15.504,They're on!
00:29:15.504,00:29:18.840,"And, uh, yeah."
00:29:18.840,00:29:21.843,Give it up for Sex Bob-Omb.
00:29:21.843,00:29:24.179,"I heart you, Sex Bob-Omb!"
00:29:26.139,00:29:27.725,"Scott, you ready?"
00:29:27.725,00:29:33.355,"Okay. Kim, are you-- We are Sex Bob-Omb!"
00:29:34.565,00:29:36.191,Whoo!
00:30:50.390,00:30:53.769,Mr. Pilgrim!
00:30:53.769,00:30:56.271,It is I!
00:30:56.271,00:30:58.106,Matthew Patel.
00:30:59.483,00:31:02.027,Consider our fight... begun!
00:31:02.986,00:31:04.697,What did I do?
00:31:04.697,00:31:08.158,- What do I do?
00:31:09.159,00:31:10.952,Fight!
00:31:10.952,00:31:12.830,Fight! Fight!
00:31:22.464,00:31:24.842,All right!
00:31:26.259,00:31:28.512,All right.
00:31:28.512,00:31:31.097,Watch out!
00:31:31.097,00:31:32.725,Ha!
00:32:03.922,00:32:05.549,"Well, well, well."
00:32:06.884,00:32:09.553,"You're quite the opponent, Pilgrim."
00:32:09.553,00:32:11.137,Who the hell are you anyway?
00:32:11.137,00:32:17.018,"My name is Matthew Patel, and I'm Ramona's first..."
00:32:17.018,00:32:20.731,evil ex-boyfriend.
00:32:20.731,00:32:22.816,Her what?
00:32:23.817,00:32:25.944,Anyone need another drink?
00:32:37.623,00:32:39.792,Wait!
00:32:39.792,00:32:42.878,"Uh, didn't you get my e-mail explaining the situation?"
00:32:42.878,00:32:45.672,- I skimmed it.
00:32:45.672,00:32:48.049,You will pay for your insolence!
00:33:06.652,00:33:08.528,Ooh!
00:33:12.658,00:33:15.911,Hey! What's up with his outfit?
00:33:15.911,00:33:17.830,Yeah. Is he a pirate?
00:33:17.830,00:33:19.414,Are you a pirate?
00:33:19.414,00:33:22.626,Pirates are in this year. Die!
00:33:30.342,00:33:33.887,You really went out with this guy?
00:33:33.887,00:33:35.764,Yeah...
00:33:35.764,00:33:38.433,In the seventh grade.
00:33:38.433,00:33:41.144,- And?
00:33:43.730,00:33:49.110,"It was football season, and for some reason, all the little jocks wanted me."
00:33:49.110,00:33:56.869,"Matthew was the only nonwhite, nonjock boy in town, so the two of us joined forces, and we took 'em all down."
00:33:56.869,00:34:00.372,We brawled and scrapped and fought for hours.
00:34:00.372,00:34:03.375,Nothing could beat Matthew's mystical powers.
00:34:03.375,00:34:05.669,We only kissed once.
00:34:05.669,00:34:08.630,"After a week and a half, I told him to hit the showers."
00:34:08.630,00:34:12.217,"Dude, wait."
00:34:12.217,00:34:17.263,"for this, Flowers!"
00:34:21.018,00:34:22.477,- What?
00:34:32.654,00:34:38.869,"Tung, ta-ka-ta - This guy's good."
00:34:41.788,00:34:44.123,"Tell him, Matty."
00:35:03.393,00:35:05.729,That doesn't even rhyme.
00:35:08.314,00:35:11.777,This is impossible.
00:35:11.777,00:35:14.780,Open your eyes.
00:35:16.907,00:35:19.952,K.O.!
00:35:26.917,00:35:29.795,Sweet! Coins.
00:35:29.795,00:35:32.005,That just happened.
00:35:32.005,00:35:34.967,"Well, it was nice meeting you."
00:35:34.967,00:35:38.553,Tell your gay friends I said bye.
00:35:39.888,00:35:42.223,Wallace! Again?
00:35:42.223,00:35:44.309,"Get a room, guys!"
00:35:44.309,00:35:46.311,"Oh, man. 2.40!"
00:35:46.311,00:35:48.354,That's not even enough for the bus home.
00:35:48.354,00:35:50.440,I'll lend you the 35 cents.
00:35:50.440,00:35:54.277,"Yeah, so, Sex Bob-Omb wins."
00:35:54.277,00:35:57.823,Sex Bob-Omb won?
00:35:57.823,00:36:00.867,Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!
00:36:00.867,00:36:03.036,Oh.
00:36:04.704,00:36:08.207,what was all that all about?
00:36:08.207,00:36:13.379,"Um, I guess..."
00:36:13.379,00:36:16.424,"if we're gonna date, you may have to defeat my seven evil exes."
00:36:16.424,00:36:18.802,You have seven evil ex-boyfriends?
00:36:18.802,00:36:20.637,And I have to fight-- Defeat.
00:36:20.637,00:36:25.142,Defeat your seven evil exes if we're going to continue to date?
00:36:25.142,00:36:28.937,- Pretty much.
00:36:28.937,00:36:31.230,we are dating?
00:36:31.230,00:36:34.317,"Uh, I guess."
00:36:34.317,00:36:35.902,Does that mean we can make out?
00:36:35.902,00:36:39.197,Sure.
00:36:39.197,00:36:40.323,Aw!
00:36:49.582,00:36:51.501,Someone's happy.
00:36:51.501,00:36:54.004,"Well, someone got to second base last night."
00:36:54.004,00:36:57.049,And someone has a second date tonight.
00:36:57.049,00:36:59.634,Someone's lucky then.
00:36:59.634,00:37:02.220,"You know when I say someone, I mean me, right?"
00:37:02.220,00:37:04.764,I got to second base last night.
00:37:04.764,00:37:08.393,Maybe first and a half.
00:37:08.393,00:37:13.023,"So, I invited Ramona over for dinner tonight, so you can't be here."
00:37:13.023,00:37:16.442,I don't want you gaying up the place.
00:37:16.442,00:37:18.277,"Okay, Scott."
00:37:18.277,00:37:21.198,"But in return, I have to issue an ultimatum."
00:37:21.198,00:37:24.659,One of your famous ultimatums?
00:37:24.659,00:37:30.248,You have to break up with Knives-- that poor angel-- today.
00:37:30.248,00:37:33.960,But it's hard.
00:37:33.960,00:37:37.130,"If you don't, I'm going to tell Ramona about Knives."
00:37:37.130,00:37:38.757,"I swear to God, Scott."
00:37:37.130,00:37:40.884,What? Are you-- - Hi. Good morning.
00:37:40.884,00:37:43.720,- Double standard!
00:37:43.720,00:37:45.847,If you've got a problem with it-- Stop!
00:37:45.847,00:37:48.516,Take it up with Liberace's ghost.
00:37:48.516,00:37:51.019,Give me the bacon and go do your dirt while I watch the Lucas Lee marathon.
00:37:51.019,00:37:53.813,- Who's Lucas Lee?
00:37:53.813,00:37:56.858,He was this pretty good skater.
00:37:56.858,00:37:59.360,He's filming a Winifred Hailey movie in Toronto right now.
00:37:59.360,00:38:01.613,- They make movies in Toronto?
00:38:01.613,00:38:04.323,- I'm stalking him later.
00:38:01.613,00:38:06.367,- So this Lucas Lee-- - Lucas Lee is not important to you right now.
00:38:06.367,00:38:07.911,Get out.
00:38:09.328,00:38:12.498,You suck.
00:38:12.498,00:38:14.542,Surprising no one.
00:38:16.419,00:38:19.505,"Now you listen close and you listen hard, bucko."
00:38:19.505,00:38:21.925,The next click you'll hear is me hanging up.
00:38:21.925,00:38:24.010,The one after that...
00:38:24.010,00:38:26.096,is me pulling the trigger.
00:38:29.975,00:38:34.813,"Oh, hey, Knives."
00:38:34.813,00:38:40.318,Are you wearing a tan jacket-- like a spring jacket-- and a hoodie?
00:38:40.318,00:38:42.821,Um-- And a dorky hat?
00:38:42.821,00:38:44.906,It's not dorky.
00:38:44.906,00:38:46.699,Hey!
00:38:46.699,00:38:48.701,Hey.
00:38:48.701,00:38:50.162,Hey.
00:38:51.537,00:38:53.290,"Oh, my God."
00:38:53.290,00:38:55.541,I can't believe T-CAD's coming to town.
00:38:55.541,00:38:57.543,Will you take me to the show?
00:38:57.543,00:39:03.508,"Yeah. Listen, um-- Oh, hey."
00:39:03.508,00:39:06.011,Like Chinese food?
00:39:06.011,00:39:08.638,To meet my parents.
00:39:08.638,00:39:10.807,I think that's a really bad idea.
00:39:10.807,00:39:15.436,"No, it's okay. Why?"
00:39:15.436,00:39:18.982,"No, you're not."
00:39:18.982,00:39:22.235,Are you even allowed to date outside your race or whatever?
00:39:22.235,00:39:25.155,I don't care.
00:39:25.155,00:39:28.074,I'm-- I'm in...
00:39:29.659,00:39:31.410,love.
00:39:34.455,00:39:37.709,Uh-- Listen.
00:39:38.793,00:39:40.712,I was thinking...
00:39:42.130,00:39:45.258,we should break up or whatever.
00:39:47.552,00:39:50.096,- Really?
00:39:50.096,00:39:53.183,It's not gonna work out.
00:39:55.560,00:39:56.853,Oh.
00:40:26.174,00:40:28.634,Where's Knives?
00:40:28.634,00:40:30.595,"No, we broke up."
00:40:30.595,00:40:33.890,I learned the bass line from Final Fantasy II.
00:40:37.727,00:40:40.605,"Scott, you are the salt of the earth."
00:40:40.605,00:40:44.109,I meant scum of the earth.
00:40:44.109,00:40:47.445,- You broke up with Knives?
00:40:47.445,00:40:49.989,Maybe soon you'll meet my new new girlfriend.
00:40:49.989,00:40:51.449,- New new.
00:40:51.449,00:40:53.785,- Okay.
00:40:53.785,00:41:00.208,"From here on out, no girlfriends or girlfriend talk at practice, - whether they're old, new or new new."
00:41:00.208,00:41:02.835,We were lucky to survive the last round.
00:41:02.835,00:41:05.755,"- It's sudden death now, okay?"
00:41:11.761,00:41:14.889,- That's for me! That's for me.
00:41:14.889,00:41:17.642,Hey! You're here.
00:41:18.726,00:41:20.437,"Yes, like you said."
00:41:22.147,00:41:24.107,"You know, your hair?"
00:41:24.107,00:41:27.402,It's all blue.
00:41:27.402,00:41:29.779,Get used to it.
00:41:29.779,00:41:33.866,So... how do you guys all know each other?
00:41:33.866,00:41:36.995,"Um, high school, I guess."
00:41:36.995,00:41:40.039,What Neil said.
00:41:40.039,00:41:42.875,"Believe it or not, I actually dated Scott in high school."
00:41:42.875,00:41:44.502,"Oh, got any embarrassing stories?"
00:41:44.502,00:41:46.129,Yeah. He's an idiot.
00:41:46.129,00:41:48.631,"Okay, bye."
00:41:48.631,00:41:50.508,What about rehearsal?
00:41:52.469,00:41:54.053,I'm Neil.
00:42:02.645,00:42:05.690,You doing okay there?
00:42:08.318,00:42:10.736,She changed her hair.
00:42:10.736,00:42:13.614,"I know, but she did it without even making a big deal of it or anything."
00:42:13.614,00:42:17.743,"She's fickle, impulsive, spontaneous."
00:42:17.743,00:42:21.039,Can't believe you're worried about me gaying up the place.
00:42:22.332,00:42:24.583,"So, how's dinner coming along?"
00:42:24.583,00:42:26.503,"Yeah, good, good, good."
00:42:26.503,00:42:30.423,"Okay, well, I'm gonna leave you lovebirds to it."
00:42:30.423,00:42:34.427,I am heading up to Casa Loma to stalk my hetero crush.
00:42:34.427,00:42:36.679,Don't go.
00:42:36.679,00:42:39.557,You can get to second-and-a-half base tonight.
00:42:39.557,00:42:42.519,"Well, if you strike out in the next hour, come find me at the castle."
00:42:42.519,00:42:45.480,If I strike out?
00:42:50.360,00:42:52.362,This is actually really good garlic bread.
00:42:52.362,00:42:55.448,Garlic bread is my favorite food. I could honestly eat it for every meal.
00:42:55.448,00:42:58.076,Or just eat it all the time without even stopping.
00:42:58.076,00:43:00.453,- You'd get fat.
00:43:00.453,00:43:03.164,- Bread makes you fat.
00:43:05.875,00:43:08.002,- I wrote a song about you.
00:43:08.002,00:43:10.296,"Yeah, it goes like this."
00:43:34.195,00:43:36.072,Can't wait to hear it when it's finished.
00:43:36.072,00:43:38.283,- Finished?
00:43:43.662,00:43:45.206,Your hair's pretty shaggy.
00:43:45.206,00:43:47.833,"Oh, God!"
00:43:47.833,00:43:56.801,"No, sorry. I just-- I got a bad haircut right before me and my big ex broke up, but that was so long ago now I can barely remember."
00:43:56.801,00:43:59.345,Scott is acutely aware that his last salon haircut...
00:43:59.345,00:44:03.558,"took place exactly 431 days ago, three hours before his big breakup."
00:44:03.558,00:44:05.684,He's been cutting his own hair ever since.
00:44:05.684,00:44:08.605,So long ago.
00:44:08.605,00:44:11.232,- Sounds like a bad time.
00:44:11.232,00:44:12.984,It was.
00:44:12.984,00:44:15.236,It was a mutual thing.
00:44:15.236,00:44:18.114,"I mean, she told me it was mutual."
00:44:18.114,00:44:19.949,She dumped him. It was brutal.
00:44:19.949,00:44:21.784,What was her name?
00:44:21.784,00:44:25.663,"She was Nat when I knew her, but she stopped liking that name."
00:44:25.663,00:44:29.041,- Then she stopped liking me.
00:44:29.041,00:44:31.628,"But it'd be cuter short, wouldn't it?"
00:44:31.628,00:44:34.631,- What?
00:44:34.631,00:44:36.257,I thought we could go for a walk.
00:44:37.634,00:44:39.718,Tell me we didn't come out here in the cold...
00:44:39.718,00:44:41.220,so you could cover your hair with that hat.
00:44:41.220,00:44:43.389,"No, no. I just love me some walking, you know."
00:44:43.389,00:44:47.143,"Just putting one leg in front of the other, like this."
00:44:47.143,00:44:48.978,Walking.
00:44:48.978,00:44:51.314,You seem a little...
00:44:51.314,00:44:55.067,"Yeah. Yeah, I don't know."
00:44:55.067,00:44:59.405,"Not that I do drugs, unless you do drugs, in which case I do drugs all the time-- every drug."
00:44:59.405,00:45:01.782,Yeah. I don't know.
00:45:01.782,00:45:06.412,"Just when I'm with you, things sort of seem a little brighter."
00:45:06.412,00:45:08.998,What is this place?
00:45:08.998,00:45:10.667,They're shooting this movie here right now.
00:45:10.667,00:45:12.418,"Okay, everybody, let's do this."
00:45:12.418,00:45:14.587,"Lots to do, everyone."
00:45:14.587,00:45:16.673,Did you find the guy you were stalking?
00:45:16.673,00:45:19.925,I think I'm about to right now.
00:45:19.925,00:45:22.261,Mr. Lee?
00:45:22.261,00:45:24.805,Oh.
00:45:24.805,00:45:29.352,And roll sound.
00:45:32.230,00:45:35.525,I wanna have his adopted babies.
00:45:37.276,00:45:39.278,Here we go.
00:45:39.278,00:45:41.906,All right.
00:45:41.906,00:45:44.158,"Oh, man. We gotta go."
00:45:44.158,00:45:46.661,I used to date that clown.
00:45:46.661,00:45:48.413,- And-- - Action.
00:45:48.413,00:45:51.123,"Oh, my God."
00:45:51.123,00:45:52.958,Hey!
00:45:52.958,00:45:55.044,The only thing keeping me and her apart...
00:45:55.044,00:45:57.547,are the two minutes it's gonna take to kick your ass.
00:45:57.547,00:46:00.925,You dated a famous guy?
00:46:00.925,00:46:03.553,It might have been math.
00:46:03.553,00:46:05.762,- Hey!
00:46:05.762,00:46:08.974,He just followed me around.
00:46:08.974,00:46:11.561,Hey!
00:46:11.561,00:46:13.271,"He's famous, and he talked to me."
00:46:13.271,00:46:15.648,The only thing keeping me and her apart...
00:46:15.648,00:46:18.401,is the two minutes it's gonna take to kick your ass!
00:46:18.401,00:46:20.861,"Can I have your-- Can I have your autograph, please?"
00:46:24.407,00:46:26.367,What's up?
00:46:26.367,00:46:28.536,He seems nice.
00:46:31.163,00:46:32.707,Boom!
00:46:35.000,00:46:38.755,And that's a cut!
00:46:38.755,00:46:40.632,Scott!
00:46:40.632,00:46:42.467,Evil ex. Fight.
00:46:42.467,00:46:44.761,"Let's get ready to go again, please."
00:46:44.761,00:46:48.013,Let's get ready to go again.
00:46:48.013,00:46:50.516,"You really think you can stand a chance against an A-lister, bro?"
00:46:54.562,00:46:56.564,Some competish you are.
00:46:58.733,00:47:00.526,Hey!
00:47:00.526,00:47:02.861,- Hey!
00:47:02.861,00:47:06.198,"- Hey, I'm not done with you."
00:47:08.409,00:47:10.453,Looks like you're seeing double.
00:47:11.870,00:47:13.289,"He's good, right?"
00:47:13.289,00:47:18.336,"Sometimes I let him do the wide shots, when I feel like getting blazed back in my Winnie."
00:47:24.091,00:47:26.927,What can I say?
00:47:26.927,00:47:29.555,I'm nothing without my stunt team.
00:47:34.268,00:47:36.395,Hey!
00:47:36.395,00:47:38.773,Ask them how it feels to always get his sloppy seconds.
00:47:36.395,00:48:15.685,"How does it-- Hey, I'm gonna get a coffee."
00:48:15.685,00:48:17.770,"No, I just-- No."
00:48:24.652,00:48:27.321,"Oh, that's actually hilarious."
00:48:27.321,00:48:29.448,Hilarious.
00:48:31.200,00:48:32.744,Mr. Lee!
00:48:36.789,00:48:39.250,You're needed back on set.
00:49:05.902,00:49:11.323,Prepare-- Prepare to feel the wrath...
00:49:11.323,00:49:13.158,of the League of Evil Exes.
00:49:13.158,00:49:14.869,The League of Evil Axes?
00:49:14.869,00:49:16.788,You really don't know about the league?
00:49:16.788,00:49:19.624,Um-- The Seven Evil Exes?
00:49:19.624,00:49:21.250,Coming to kill you?
00:49:21.250,00:49:24.754,Controlling the future of Ramona's love life?
00:49:24.754,00:49:27.590,- No.
00:49:27.590,00:49:29.592,Really?
00:49:29.592,00:49:31.636,That's great.
00:49:33.970,00:49:35.431,Ooh!
00:49:35.431,00:49:37.391,You are a pretty good actor.
00:49:37.391,00:49:40.144,I'm going for the Oscar this year.
00:49:40.144,00:49:42.020,But are you a pretty good skater?
00:49:42.020,00:49:44.565,"I'm more than pretty good, ese."
00:49:44.565,00:49:46.609,I have my own skate company.
00:49:46.609,00:49:49.570,But can you do a thingy...
00:49:49.570,00:49:51.447,on that rail?
00:49:52.989,00:49:55.159,"It's called a grind, bro."
00:49:55.159,00:49:59.163,So can you do a grindy thingy now?
00:50:00.539,00:50:02.667,Are you serious?
00:50:04.460,00:50:07.045,"There are, like, 200 steps, and the rails are garbage."
00:50:07.045,00:50:13.594,"Well, hey, if it's too hard core, then-- You really think you can goad me into doing a trick like that?"
00:50:13.594,00:50:15.638,- There are girls watching.
00:50:17.723,00:50:19.684,Somebody get me my board.

00:50:58.890,00:51:02.768,Ah! I didn't get his autograph.
00:51:02.768,00:51:05.145,"And that's a wrap, everybody."
00:51:05.145,00:51:07.606,"Hey, where's Ramona?"
00:51:07.606,00:51:10.359,No.
00:51:10.359,00:51:12.820,What's the deal? Seriously.
00:51:12.820,00:51:14.989,"Let's move, people."
00:51:17.115,00:51:19.284,"Hey, it's me again-- Scott."
00:51:19.284,00:51:21.328,Give me a call when you get this.
00:51:21.328,00:51:23.414,Scott Pilgrim.
00:51:23.414,00:51:26.458,What's the deal?
00:51:26.458,00:51:28.878,Yep.
00:51:28.878,00:51:31.505,- You know what really sucks though?
00:51:31.505,00:51:36.010,- Everything.
00:51:36.010,00:51:38.888,- You can't say you didn't see this coming.
00:51:40.681,00:51:42.975,What did you think these were?
00:51:42.975,00:51:45.978,Kisses?
00:51:45.978,00:51:48.981,Seven... deadly... X's.
00:51:48.981,00:51:51.358,X's.
00:51:51.358,00:51:54.987,Why does everything have to be so complicated?
00:51:54.987,00:51:58.323,"If you want something bad, you have to fight for it."
00:51:58.323,00:52:01.619,"Step up your game, Scott."
00:52:01.619,00:52:04.288,Lesbian?
00:52:04.288,00:52:07.416,Lesbians?
00:52:07.416,00:52:09.668,I wasn't trying to trick you.
00:52:09.668,00:52:11.712,"Hey, buddy, look."
00:52:11.712,00:52:17.051,"If she really is the girl of your dreams, then you have to let her know."
00:52:17.051,00:52:21.055,You have to overcome any and all obstacles that lie in your path.
00:52:21.055,00:52:24.308,You can do it.
00:52:24.308,00:52:27.436,"- Plus, I need you to move out."
00:52:27.436,00:52:31.649,I'm banking on her calling you so I don't have to evict you and feel all guilty and shit.
00:52:31.649,00:52:34.026,"- I have a feeling that's for you, guy."
00:52:34.026,00:52:36.528,- Hey.
00:52:36.528,00:52:38.489,"Hey, Scott."
00:52:38.489,00:52:39.865,"Oh, shit."
00:52:39.865,00:52:42.451,Been a while.
00:52:42.451,00:52:45.287,"A year, I think?"
00:52:45.287,00:52:48.457,How are you?
00:52:48.457,00:52:50.668,"Oh, that's too bad."
00:52:50.668,00:52:54.212,Still breaking hearts?
00:52:50.668,00:52:56.757,What? No. I've been-- It's been different.
00:52:56.757,00:52:59.384,Probably not.
00:52:59.384,00:53:02.304,Should I be jealous?
00:53:02.304,00:53:06.684,"I have this totally awesome girlfriend who calls me all the time, and she's America."
00:53:06.684,00:53:08.686,She's American.
00:53:08.686,00:53:10.855,I'm not telling you that.
00:53:10.855,00:53:13.149,Oh.
00:53:13.149,00:53:16.234,What? No.
00:53:16.234,00:53:19.113,I gotta go.
00:53:19.113,00:53:21.157,Wait.
00:53:24.451,00:53:27.872,Okay.
00:53:29.915,00:53:31.583,- Everything does suck.
00:53:31.583,00:53:34.461,Or does it?
00:53:34.461,00:53:37.006,"Oh, hey, Knives."
00:53:37.006,00:53:39.133,What's that?
00:53:39.133,00:53:41.301,- Is Scott here?
00:53:41.301,00:53:44.513,"Oh, you know what?"
00:53:46.306,00:53:48.851,- Really?
00:53:50.394,00:53:51.854,Sorry.
00:53:54.398,00:53:56.942,Do you have a girlfriend?
00:53:56.942,00:53:59.570,Seven... deadly... X's.
00:53:59.570,00:54:03.281,You may have to defeat my seven evil exes.
00:54:03.281,00:54:06.077,"It's sudden death now, okay?"
00:54:06.077,00:54:08.286,"She's got some battle scars, dude."
00:54:08.286,00:54:10.873,You can't say you didn't see this coming.
00:54:12.666,00:54:14.752,Dude.
00:54:16.336,00:54:18.714,Please.
00:54:18.714,00:54:21.175,I'm really not in the mood for this.
00:54:23.052,00:54:24.511,"Okay, enough!"
00:54:30.809,00:54:32.561,You punched me in the boob!
00:54:33.979,00:54:36.148,"Prepare to die, obviously."
00:54:36.148,00:54:38.400,"Look, I've had it today."
00:54:38.400,00:54:43.279,"Oh, I'd love to postpone, darlin', but I just cashed my last rain check."
00:54:43.279,00:54:45.241,- What's that from?
00:54:45.241,00:54:48.284,"Well, I'm really, really not up for this-- whatever it is."
00:54:48.284,00:54:51.830,"Okay, little chicken."
00:54:51.830,00:54:53.749,But you won't see me...
00:54:53.749,00:54:57.335,"because next time, I'll be deadly serious next time."
00:54:57.335,00:54:59.797,- What?
00:55:01.090,00:55:03.801,"Oh, man. Someone help me."
00:55:03.801,00:55:05.552,Hello.
00:55:05.552,00:55:07.596,It's Scott.
00:55:07.596,00:55:10.182,"No, it's Scott."
00:55:10.182,00:55:12.559,I didn't do anything.
00:55:12.559,00:55:14.728,"Look, I'm having a meltdown or whatever."
00:55:14.728,00:55:16.814,I'm literally about to leave.
00:55:23.487,00:55:25.697,I think I'll make it a decaf today.
00:55:25.697,00:55:28.575,What did you do with my sister?
00:55:28.575,00:55:30.786,"Sorry, I had to go."
00:55:30.786,00:55:35.624,"So, what can I-- Is there anywhere you don't work?"
00:55:35.624,00:55:38.085,ball like you wouldn't know anything about.
00:55:38.085,00:55:40.378,believe you asked Ramona out...
00:55:40.378,00:55:44.049,after I specifically told you How are you doing that with your mouth?
00:55:44.049,00:55:46.093,how I'm doing it!
00:55:46.093,00:55:47.928,What do you have to say for yourself?
00:55:47.928,00:55:50.514,Can I get a caramel macchiato?
00:55:50.514,00:55:56.394,you took a look in a mirror before you wreak havoc on another girl.
00:55:56.394,00:55:58.772,I hear the girl that kicked your heart in the ass...
00:55:58.772,00:56:01.775,is walking the streets of Toronto again.
00:56:01.775,00:56:03.986,"So, I can just get my coffee over here?"
00:56:05.946,00:56:10.450,Sorry that got a little crazy last night.
00:56:10.450,00:56:12.661,"Yeah, I do that."
00:56:14.830,00:56:18.000,"Listen, I know I can be hard to be around sometimes."
00:56:18.000,00:56:21.086,I totally understand if you don't wanna hang out anymore.
00:56:21.086,00:56:23.047,"No, no. I want to hang."
00:56:21.086,00:56:25.757,"It's-- - You know, the whole evil ex-boyfriend thing-- - Exes."
00:56:25.757,00:56:35.351,"It's no biggie. Um-- You know, I know it's early, but I-- I don't think anything can get in the way of how I-- Shit!"
00:56:35.351,00:56:37.978,It's my ex.
00:56:37.978,00:56:40.689,Mm-hmm. Envy.
00:56:42.524,00:56:46.320,I'm gonna-- Excuse me.
00:56:49.156,00:56:51.449,Your hair's getting shaggy.
00:56:51.449,00:56:53.994,"So, that's Ramona."
00:56:53.994,00:56:55.411,Okay. I'm jealous.
00:56:55.411,00:56:57.831,You're jealous?
00:56:57.831,00:57:02.044,You left me for that cocky pretty boy.
00:57:02.044,00:57:04.755,I know.
00:57:04.755,00:57:07.632,Maybe you will see him.
00:57:07.632,00:57:10.510,You should so totally come.
00:57:10.510,00:57:13.471,That's so not going to happen.
00:57:13.471,00:57:16.183,Great.
00:57:16.183,00:57:18.602,Caramel macchiato.
00:57:20.729,00:57:23.399,So that was Envy.
00:57:23.399,00:57:25.067,What happened with the two of you?
00:57:25.067,00:57:27.319,Do you mind if we don't get into it right now?
00:57:27.319,00:57:32.116,"She wanted to move to Montreal, 'cause she missed her best friend-- this guy Todd."
00:57:32.116,00:57:34.410,"And two weeks later, you heard they were sleeping together, I guess?"
00:57:34.410,00:57:36.036,Basically.
00:57:36.036,00:57:39.123,I dated a Todd once.
00:57:39.123,00:57:43.001,I can see how it sucks-- having the past come back to haunt you.
00:57:43.001,00:57:45.379,Is it wrong that I try not to think about it?
00:57:45.379,00:57:47.298,What do you want to think about?
00:57:47.298,00:57:50.426,How warm my place is right now.
00:57:52.303,00:57:55.347,And you didn't bang her?
00:57:55.347,00:57:57.808,I couldn't stop thinking about my stupid ex-girlfriend.
00:57:57.808,00:57:59.935,Is that the Uma Thurman movie?
00:57:59.935,00:58:03.897,"Scott, just because Envy's back in town doesn't make it not over."
00:58:03.897,00:58:05.857,Double negative.
00:58:05.857,00:58:07.901,It's over.
00:58:07.901,00:58:09.820,Word.
00:58:09.820,00:58:11.905,I'm not gonna let her toy with me.
00:58:11.905,00:58:17.577,"From this moment on, I will think of Envy Adams no more."
00:58:17.577,00:58:19.788,I have distressing news.
00:58:19.788,00:58:22.833,Is the news that we suck?
00:58:22.833,00:58:27.879,"No. Clash at Demonhead are doing a secret show tomorrow night, and Envy asked us to open for them."
00:58:27.879,00:58:31.342,I hate you.
00:58:31.342,00:58:33.510,Maybe you can put your history aside until we get through this thing.
00:58:33.510,00:58:36.554,"You know, for the band?"
00:58:36.554,00:58:38.515,Can't we do our own-- For the band?
00:58:38.515,00:58:41.101,-Can't we do our own secret shows?
00:58:41.101,00:58:44.604,We're doin' it!
00:58:44.604,00:58:46.398,We play the next round of the battle on Tuesday.
00:58:46.398,00:58:49.776,We gotta get some buzz going.
00:58:49.776,00:58:51.487,We need stalkers.
00:58:58.369,00:59:02.664,"What would you do if your ex was in a band, and they wanted you to open for them?"
00:59:02.664,00:59:05.501,If my ex was in a band?
00:59:05.501,00:59:09.087,"Might be a little awkward, but maybe it's the grown-up thing to do."
00:59:09.087,00:59:11.673,Yeah. We're all adults here.
00:59:13.717,00:59:15.260,"Oh, my God!"
00:59:15.260,00:59:17.429,He's dating a fat-ass hipster chick.
00:59:17.429,00:59:18.722,I hate her stupid guts.
00:59:18.722,00:59:21.058,He only likes her because she's old.
00:59:21.058,00:59:24.186,"She's probably, like, 25!"
00:59:24.186,00:59:26.813,"Oh! She's just a fat-ass white girl, you know?"
00:59:26.813,00:59:28.732,I think you mentioned she was fat.
00:59:28.732,00:59:30.775,She's got a head start.
00:59:30.775,00:59:33.611,"I didn't even know there was good music until, like, two months ago."
00:59:33.611,00:59:35.864,"- Hey, this really burns."
00:59:35.864,00:59:39.284,"When I got this idea, I just thought, I have to do it!"
00:59:39.284,00:59:41.412,I can't hear anything you're saying.
00:59:41.412,00:59:44.956,"Oh, God. I look so..."
00:59:44.956,00:59:48.293,good.
00:59:48.293,00:59:50.712,Ramona Flowers stole my Scott.
00:59:50.712,00:59:54.508,But I know how to get him back.
00:59:54.508,00:59:56.634,How?
01:00:14.152,01:00:15.653,Thank you.
01:00:15.653,01:00:17.864,Yeah!
01:00:17.864,01:00:23.745,"We have some merch at the back, so-- Okay. Bar? Now?"
01:00:26.998,01:00:29.918,Level with me.
01:00:29.918,01:00:31.753,I don't know.
01:00:33.922,01:00:36.592,She has to go.
01:00:40.887,01:00:42.889,"Hey, Ramona."
01:00:42.889,01:00:45.892,Hey.
01:00:45.892,01:00:48.479,What the hell?
01:00:56.236,01:00:58.822,Hey.
01:00:58.822,01:01:00.240,"Hey, Scott."
01:01:00.240,01:01:02.200,What the hell?
01:01:02.200,01:01:04.202,Look who Knives is hanging out with.
01:01:04.202,01:01:06.204,Who is that girl again?
01:01:06.204,01:01:08.832,Scott dated her.
01:01:08.832,01:01:10.626,\How old is she?
01:01:10.626,01:01:17.633,"Um-- I gotta pee on her-- I mean, I gotta pee."
01:01:17.633,01:01:19.551,Pee time.
01:01:19.551,01:01:27.767,And then it was time-- for Toronto to drown in the sweet sorrow...
01:01:27.767,01:01:31.438,of The Clash at Demonhead!
01:01:31.438,01:01:34.650,Envy! Envy!
01:01:39.779,01:01:42.824,That guy on bass?
01:01:42.824,01:01:45.327,That's Todd.
01:01:45.327,01:01:46.870,"Oh, yeah?"
01:01:47.996,01:01:49.623,You know?
01:01:49.623,01:01:51.542,"Oh, yeah!"
01:01:51.542,01:01:53.710,"Oh, no."
01:02:41.633,01:02:44.802,That was-- That was devastating.
01:02:44.802,01:02:47.639,"Oh, my God!"
01:02:47.639,01:02:50.141,You should see 'em live.
01:02:50.141,01:02:52.810,I think I'm gonna throw up.
01:02:52.810,01:02:58.525,"I can't even believe I'm saying this, - but Envy Adams would like you all to come backstage."
01:03:04.822,01:03:06.908,Wait. How do you know Envy?
01:03:06.908,01:03:08.535,Scott dated her.
01:03:12.372,01:03:14.040,"Hey, Ramona."
01:03:14.040,01:03:16.334,"Hey, Todd."
01:03:16.334,01:03:18.336,It's been a while.
01:03:18.336,01:03:19.837,Mm-hmm.
01:03:19.837,01:03:21.089,Mm-hmm.
01:03:21.089,01:03:22.882,I think we should get outta here.
01:03:22.882,01:03:24.801,So how was the tour?
01:03:24.801,01:03:26.970,You're like a superstar now.
01:03:26.970,01:03:30.098,"Yeah. It's, uh, not really something I can put into words."
01:03:30.098,01:03:33.435,"Um, Envy, I read your blog."
01:03:33.435,01:03:37.063,"So, Scott and Ramona, eh?"
01:03:37.063,01:03:39.524,What of it?
01:03:39.524,01:03:41.568,Suit each other.
01:03:41.568,01:03:43.737,"You're my role model, Envy."
01:03:43.737,01:03:46.364,"Ramona, I like your outfit-- affordable."
01:03:46.364,01:03:48.283,"I was just gonna say, did you get those jeans in New York?"
01:03:48.283,01:03:52.496,- I'm talking to Ramona right now.
01:03:52.496,01:03:54.372,"Oh, did she?"
01:03:54.372,01:03:56.667,Played the Chaos Theatre for Gideon.
01:03:56.667,01:03:58.209,"You know him, right?"
01:03:59.753,01:04:02.506,I've kissed the lips that kissed you!
01:04:05.925,01:04:08.512,Knives!
01:04:08.512,01:04:11.889,What? I'm not afraid to hit a girl.
01:04:11.889,01:04:14.434,I'm a rock star.
01:04:14.434,01:04:15.811,"Oh, my God."
01:04:15.811,01:04:19.856,You punched the highlights out of her hair.
01:04:19.856,01:04:23.234,He punched the highlights out of her hair!
01:04:23.234,01:04:25.195,You are incorrigible.
01:04:25.195,01:04:27.405,I don't know the meaning of the word.
01:04:29.032,01:04:34.204,"So, uh, you guys doing anything fun while you're in town?"
01:04:34.204,01:04:35.872,Fun?
01:04:35.872,01:04:37.957,In Toronto?
01:04:37.957,01:04:40.377,- That's it! You cocky cock!
01:04:40.377,01:04:43.004,You'll pay for your crimes against humanity!
01:04:54.599,01:04:57.519,My neck.
01:04:57.519,01:04:59.855,Your hair.
01:04:59.855,01:05:01.398,Didn't you know?
01:05:01.398,01:05:03.233,Todd's vegan.
01:05:06.194,01:05:09.531,Vegan?
01:05:11.074,01:05:13.368,It's not really that big of a deal.
01:05:15.161,01:05:17.330,No kidding.
01:05:17.330,01:05:19.416,Anyone can be vegan.
01:05:20.625,01:05:22.502,"Ovo-lacto vegetarian, maybe."
01:05:22.502,01:05:23.837,Ovo-what?
01:05:23.837,01:05:26.631,I partake not in the meat...
01:05:26.631,01:05:28.717,nor the breast milk nor the ovum...
01:05:28.717,01:05:30.761,of any creature with a face.
01:05:30.761,01:05:34.806,Short answer-- being vegan just makes you better than most people.
01:05:34.806,01:05:37.893,- Bingo.
01:05:39.143,01:05:41.396,"Hey, man. Question?"
01:05:41.396,01:05:45.692,I always wondered-- how does not eating dairy products give you psychic powers?
01:05:45.692,01:05:49.821,Okay. You know how you only use 10% of your brain?
01:05:49.821,01:05:52.198,That's because the other 90% is filled with curds and whey.
01:05:52.198,01:05:54.033,Did you learn that at Vegan Academy?
01:05:54.033,01:05:55.744,"Go ahead and get snippy, baby."
01:05:55.744,01:05:58.496,"If you knew the science, maybe I'd listen to a word you say."
01:06:02.125,01:06:05.712,"If I peed my pants, would you pretend I just got wet from the rain?"
01:06:05.712,01:06:07.714,- It's not raining.
01:06:07.714,01:06:09.716,Then why don't you give me the CliffsNotes...
01:06:09.716,01:06:12.385,on how and why you ended up dating this A-hole?
01:06:12.385,01:06:13.970,Is it really important right now?
01:06:13.970,01:06:16.264,"Well, if there's a key element in his backstory..."
01:06:16.264,01:06:19.225,"that's gonna help me out in a critical moment of not dying, yes."
01:06:19.225,01:06:24.522,I was only dating Lucas until the minute Todd walked by.
01:06:24.522,01:06:28.860,"I guess that's not very nice, but I used to be kind of..."
01:06:28.860,01:06:30.361,We hated everyone.
01:06:30.361,01:06:32.906,We wrecked stuff.
01:06:32.906,01:06:34.741,He punched a hole in the moon for me.
01:06:34.741,01:06:37.160,It was pretty crazy.
01:06:37.160,01:06:40.538,"A week and a half later, he told me his dad was sending him to Vegan Academy, so..."
01:06:40.538,01:06:42.248,I dumped him.
01:06:42.248,01:06:44.501,Have you dumped everyone you've ever been with?
01:06:44.501,01:06:46.461,You've never been the dumpee?
01:06:46.461,01:06:50.507,"Look, I've dabbled in being a bitch."
01:06:50.507,01:06:52.383,It's part of the reason I moved here.
01:06:52.383,01:06:55.595,I was really hoping to just leave it all behind me.
01:06:55.595,01:06:57.848,"Hey, lovebirds."
01:06:57.848,01:07:00.517,"We have unfinished business, I and he."
01:07:00.517,01:07:03.687,- He and me.
01:07:03.687,01:07:05.563,I dislike you.
01:07:05.563,01:07:08.608,- Tell it to the cleaning lady on Monday.
01:07:08.608,01:07:11.987,- Because you'll be dust by Monday.
01:07:08.608,01:07:14.197,- Um-- Because you'll be pulverized in two seconds.
01:07:14.197,01:07:17.784,"And the cleaning lady, she cleans up dust."
01:07:17.784,01:07:19.619,She dusts.
01:07:20.704,01:07:23.080,"So-- So, what's on Monday?"
01:07:24.123,01:07:28.294,"Well, 'cause-- It's Friday now."
01:07:26.167,01:07:30.797,"She has the weekends off so-- Monday, right?"
01:07:30.797,01:07:33.008,"Basically, you can't win this fight."
01:07:33.008,01:07:34.926,"You're gonna have to give up on this girl, 'cause Todd's gonna kill you."
01:07:34.926,01:07:37.762,You used to be so nice!
01:07:49.858,01:07:52.777,"Uh, Scott, we're gonna go to Pizza Pizza for a slice."
01:07:52.777,01:07:54.905,Call us when you're done.
01:07:54.905,01:07:57.323,"Oh, he'll be done real soon."
01:08:00.201,01:08:03.538,Sounds like someone wants to get... funky.
01:09:26.913,01:09:28.706,I can read your thoughts.
01:09:28.706,01:09:30.541,Your will is broken.
01:09:30.541,01:09:31.876,You're through.
01:09:31.876,01:09:34.045,What say we drink to my memory?
01:09:34.045,01:09:36.131,Fair trade blend with soy milk?
01:09:36.131,01:09:37.882,"I'm sorry, but that's pathetic."
01:09:37.882,01:09:40.301,"Dude, I can see in your mind's eye..."
01:09:40.301,01:09:42.386,that you put half-and-half into one of those coffees...
01:09:42.386,01:09:44.597,in an attempt to make me break vegan edge.
01:09:44.597,01:09:46.307,I'll take the one with soy.
01:09:49.352,01:09:51.896,"Thanks, tool."
01:09:51.896,01:09:55.274,"Actually, muchacho, I poured the soy in this cup."
01:09:55.274,01:10:01.698,"But I thought real hard about pouring it in that cup-- you know, in my mind's eye or whatever."
01:10:01.698,01:10:03.908,What are you talking about?
01:10:03.908,01:10:05.827,"You just drank half-and-half, baby."
01:10:07.662,01:10:10.373,- Freeze! Vegan police!
01:10:10.373,01:10:14.002,"Todd Ingram, you're under arrest for veganity violation..."
01:10:14.002,01:10:17.088,Code number 827-- imbibement of half-and-half.
01:10:17.088,01:10:18.673,That's bull roar.
01:10:18.673,01:10:20.633,"No vegan diet, no vegan powers."
01:10:20.633,01:10:24.303,But-But-- I-- It's only my first offense.
01:10:24.303,01:10:26.430,Take it.
01:10:26.430,01:10:31.477,"At 12:27 a.m., on February 1, you knowingly ingested gelato."
01:10:31.477,01:10:32.478,Gelato isn't vegan?
01:10:32.478,01:10:34.313,"It's milk and eggs, bitch."
01:10:34.313,01:10:37.192,"On April 4, 7:30 p.m., you partook of a plate of chicken Parmesan."
01:10:37.192,01:10:39.986,- Chicken isn't vegan?
01:10:39.986,01:10:42.864,The de-veganizing ray.
01:10:57.754,01:11:00.506,"Oh, my God."
01:11:00.506,01:11:02.633,No.
01:11:02.633,01:11:03.968,No.
01:11:03.968,01:11:08.681,"You once were a vegone, but now you will be gone."
01:11:08.681,01:11:10.683,Vegone?
01:11:25.115,01:11:27.033,Yeah!
01:11:30.870,01:11:34.415,"Uh, sorry, I guess."
01:11:36.542,01:11:38.169,Sorry.
01:11:38.169,01:11:41.422,You just head-butted my boyfriend so hard he burst.
01:11:42.882,01:11:45.260,"You kicked my heart in the ass, so..."
01:11:45.260,01:11:49.346,"I guess we're even, Natalie."
01:11:49.346,01:11:52.349,Natalie?
01:11:52.349,01:11:55.770,No one calls me that anymore.
01:11:55.770,01:11:58.606,Maybe they should.
01:11:59.690,01:12:01.943,Let's get out of here.
01:12:08.992,01:12:12.495,"For the record, I am so pissed off for you right now."
01:12:12.495,01:12:14.080,"up, Julie."
01:12:14.080,01:12:15.206,Okay.
01:12:16.666,01:12:18.751,"We're still goin' to the after-party, right?"
01:12:18.751,01:12:20.503,I'm not sure there's gonna be much of a party.
01:12:20.503,01:12:22.172,A third of the band just went poom.
01:12:22.172,01:12:24.757,Yeah. Cool bands never go to their own after-parties.
01:12:24.757,01:12:27.551,It's just the desperate people trying to rub elbows with the label guys.
01:12:27.551,01:12:29.428,Then why would we-- Oh.
01:12:29.428,01:12:31.848,"Neil, you down?"
01:12:31.848,01:12:34.517,"Scott, you're in, right?"
01:12:34.517,01:12:38.855,- You wanna go?
01:12:38.855,01:12:41.107,- I'm not saying I wanna go.
01:12:41.107,01:12:44.068,- I'll do whatever you wanna do.
01:12:44.068,01:12:46.529,have to go to this thing.
01:12:46.529,01:12:48.405,It'll probably be a bad scene all around.
01:12:48.405,01:12:50.533,"No, I'm fine."
01:12:48.405,01:12:52.368,It's just-- It's just?
01:12:50.533,01:12:56.622,Well-- Have you ever dated someone that wasn't a total ass?
01:12:56.622,01:12:59.542,"- Well, so far, you're not a total ass."
01:12:59.542,01:13:01.752,"If it makes you feel better, you're the nicest guy I've dated."
01:13:01.752,01:13:04.255,- Wait. Is that good?
01:13:04.255,01:13:06.841,- But not later?
01:13:06.841,01:13:09.719,I'd just like to try and live in the moment if I can.
01:13:09.719,01:13:11.762,I'd just like to live.
01:13:11.762,01:13:15.225,"Look, I know Todd was bad news, but are you saying Envy wasn't?"
01:13:15.225,01:13:17.143,We all have baggage.
01:13:17.143,01:13:19.979,My baggage doesn't try and kill me every five minutes.
01:13:19.979,01:13:21.605,What did you do to make your ex-boyfriend so insane?
01:13:21.605,01:13:23.358,Exes.
01:13:23.358,01:13:25.651,No breakup is painless.
01:13:25.651,01:13:27.945,What about you and that girl Knives?
01:13:27.945,01:13:30.907,I believe I broke up with her.
01:13:30.907,01:13:33.117,And was she cool with that?
01:13:33.117,01:13:35.536,- She's totally cool with it.
01:13:35.536,01:13:38.414,Yeah. She's very mature for her age. We had a very healthy breakup.
01:13:38.414,01:13:41.209,We're all peaches and gravy.
01:13:41.209,01:13:43.127,What about you and Kim?
01:13:43.127,01:13:45.171,Me and Kim?
01:13:45.171,01:13:46.923,It was high school.
01:13:46.923,01:13:50.551,- That's it?
01:13:50.551,01:13:52.595,We changed.
01:13:52.595,01:13:54.805,"Okay, fine, I had to fight a guy to be with her."
01:13:54.805,01:13:59.685,"I fought a crazy, 80-foot-tall purple-suited dude, and I had to fight 96 guys to get to him."
01:13:59.685,01:14:02.063,"He was flying and shooting lightning bolts from his eyes, okay?"
01:14:02.063,01:14:04.815,And I kicked him so hard that he saw the curvature of the Earth.
01:14:04.815,01:14:07.193,Does that make you feel any better?
01:14:07.193,01:14:09.820,"Well, now yo are being a total ass."
01:14:09.820,01:14:13.157,I'm sorry. I'm not usually like this.
01:14:13.157,01:14:15.285,"Hey, don't worry."
01:14:15.285,01:14:17.995,I don't even know what I'm like anymore.
01:14:17.995,01:14:20.623,This ex-boyfriends thing is messing with my head.
01:14:20.623,01:14:22.541,Exes.
01:14:29.173,01:14:31.175,The girl from earlier?
01:14:31.175,01:14:33.677,- Roxy?
01:14:33.677,01:14:36.764,"Oh, boy, does she know me."
01:14:36.764,01:14:39.225,What is she talking about?
01:14:39.225,01:14:42.103,He really doesn't know?
01:14:42.103,01:14:43.438,Wait.
01:14:43.438,01:14:45.440,Mmm.
01:14:48.234,01:14:50.153,- You and her?
01:14:50.153,01:14:52.155,- Just a phase?
01:14:52.155,01:14:54.115,- It meant nothing. I didn't think it would count.
01:14:54.115,01:14:55.908,I was just a little bi-curious.
01:14:55.908,01:15:01.622,"Well, honey-- I'm a little bi-furious!"
01:15:09.088,01:15:10.381,Huh?
01:15:11.841,01:15:14.344,"Do that again, and I will end you."
01:15:14.344,01:15:15.761,"Back off, has-bian."
01:15:15.761,01:15:18.973,"If Gideon can't have you, no one can."
01:15:20.599,01:15:23.894,The league has spoken!
01:15:23.894,01:15:28.565,"Well, then Gideon best get his pretentious ass up here, 'cause I'm about to kick yours out of the Great White North."
01:15:42.497,01:15:44.707,Wallace.
01:15:44.707,01:15:46.459,"This is happening, right?"
01:15:46.459,01:15:48.127,Kick her in the balls!
01:16:10.483,01:16:14.404,"I'm sending you back to Gideon in a thousand pieces, you slag!"
01:16:14.404,01:16:16.280,Whoa!
01:16:16.280,01:16:18.199,Ha!
01:16:22.370,01:16:24.705,I'd rather be dead than go back.
01:16:24.705,01:16:27.250,"He's a creep, you're a bitch, and you all deserve each other."
01:16:27.250,01:16:30.378,"Give it a rest, Ramona."
01:16:30.378,01:16:35.174,Meaning your precious Scott must defeat me with his own fists.
01:16:35.174,01:16:38.135,"Uh, I don't think I can hit a girl."
01:16:38.135,01:16:39.512,They're soft.
01:16:39.512,01:16:41.305,- You don't have a choice.
01:17:00.157,01:17:02.577,"Fight your own battles, lazy ass!"
01:17:08.332,01:17:10.251,- Lazy ass!
01:17:16.715,01:17:21.512,Every pilgrim reaches the end of his journey-- some sooner than others.
01:17:23.556,01:17:28.269,Your B.F.'s about to get F'd in the B!
01:17:28.269,01:17:31.272,Her weak point's the back of her knees.
01:17:31.272,01:17:33.524,Great. How does that work?
01:17:33.524,01:17:37.612,"Whenever we were making out, I would just-- Okay, enough!"
01:17:45.161,01:17:49.915,You'll never be able to do this to her.
01:18:00.468,01:18:03.429,"Oh, if I was Scott Pilgrim.."
01:18:03.429,01:18:08.934,"So-- Two gin and tonics, please."
01:18:08.934,01:18:11.479,Only on special occasions.
01:18:11.479,01:18:14.524,"I guess we really don't know that much about each other, do we?"
01:18:14.524,01:18:21.405,"Maybe you could just give me a list of all your exes, so I could at least know who's gonna beat my ass into the ground next."
01:18:21.405,01:18:23.407,Like a handy little laminate or something?
01:18:23.407,01:18:25.284,Maybe we could exchange our information.
01:18:25.284,01:18:27.119,"Hey, just out of sheer curiosity..."
01:18:27.119,01:18:32.333,"and concern for my mortal well-being, is there anyone at this party that you haven't slept with?"
01:18:36.462,01:18:38.130,I think we should split.
01:18:38.130,01:18:41.258,"As in get out of here, or as in split split?"
01:18:41.258,01:18:42.968,I'd hope you could figure that out.
01:18:42.968,01:18:44.803,Or did you miss the part where I saved your ass?
01:18:44.803,01:18:47.640,How could I?
01:18:47.640,01:18:50.309,- Dirty laundry. You're drunk.
01:18:50.309,01:18:54.230,I'm sorry I cared.
01:18:54.230,01:18:56.899,I thought you might be more understanding.
01:18:54.230,01:18:59.026,I just-- You're just another evil ex waiting to happen.
01:19:00.944,01:19:03.072,That was harsh.
01:19:05.074,01:19:07.993,That was not good.
01:19:07.993,01:19:10.079,That was embarrassing.
01:19:12.707,01:19:14.709,P.S. Here's your stupid list.
01:19:16.293,01:19:22.174,"Matthew Patel, Lucas Lee, Todd Ingram, Roxy Richter-- Who the hell are the Katayanagi twins?"
01:19:22.174,01:19:24.343,Oh.
01:19:24.343,01:19:26.136,You don't know?
01:19:26.136,01:19:28.389,The Katayanagi twins just happen to be...
01:19:28.389,01:19:30.266,the next band in the battle.
01:19:30.266,01:19:33.185,And they are totally bad-ass.
01:19:33.185,01:19:35.646,Ramona dated twins?
01:19:35.646,01:19:37.231,At the same time?
01:19:37.231,01:19:39.609,You know what?
01:19:39.609,01:19:44.238,Good. 'Cause you know how I feel about girls-- Good. I play better when I'm in a bad mood.
01:19:44.238,01:19:47.157,"If it's gonna be an issue, Young Neil can fill in for you."
01:19:47.157,01:19:49.034,You know bands.
01:19:49.034,01:19:51.245,We'd understand if you didn't want to take part.
01:19:51.245,01:19:54.290,"Not only do I want to take part, I want to take them apart."
01:19:54.290,01:19:57.585,Okay.
01:19:59.169,01:20:01.838,"Okay, we're doomed."
01:20:01.838,01:20:03.674,That poster needs more exclamation marks.
01:20:03.674,01:20:06.093,we're gonna get killed.
01:20:06.093,01:20:08.137,Come on.
01:20:08.137,01:20:10.013,"What, aren't the Katayanagis going on first?"
01:20:10.013,01:20:12.933,I think you're both goin' first.
01:20:12.933,01:20:14.935,Wait. Amp versus amp?
01:20:14.935,01:20:17.020,We're going on stage at the same time?
01:20:17.020,01:20:19.273,That's impossible.
01:20:19.273,01:20:21.024,"Okay, my bad."
01:20:21.024,01:20:23.819,is saying My bad.
01:20:23.819,01:20:27.281,We shouldn't even be here.
01:20:27.281,01:20:29.866,"Come on, man!"
01:20:29.866,01:20:31.410,"If I can do that, we can do anything."
01:20:31.410,01:20:33.996,- Did you speak to Ramona then?
01:20:33.996,01:20:36.832,- I haven't seen her since the other night.
01:20:36.832,01:20:38.584,She's totally here.
01:20:41.211,01:20:46.676,"Scott, not that I care, but you should go talk to her before she's gone."
01:20:46.676,01:20:49.470,"- Thanks, Kim."
01:20:51.514,01:20:54.224,I didn't mean to put you through all that.
01:20:54.224,01:20:55.892,You know that.
01:21:32.471,01:21:34.598,"Okay, gang, can we do this?"
01:21:34.598,01:21:37.727,"- I mean, we can do this. Right?"
01:21:37.727,01:21:40.354,Scott?
01:21:40.354,01:21:42.105,Scott!
01:21:59.832,01:22:02.501,They tore the roof off!
01:22:02.501,01:22:04.461,Whoo!
01:22:04.461,01:22:07.757,"We are Sex Bob-Omb, and we're here to make you think about death..."
01:22:07.757,01:22:09.925,and get sad and stuff.
01:23:03.604,01:23:07.023,Let's just break up now and get it over with.
01:23:07.023,01:23:09.902,We screwed the pooch in front of Gideon Graves.
01:23:09.902,01:23:12.529,We're done.
01:23:12.529,01:23:15.491,That geeky guy next to your girlfriend.
01:23:17.075,01:23:20.788,That's Gideon?
01:23:20.788,01:23:23.290,All right.
01:24:22.016,01:24:23.600,We're out.
01:24:28.772,01:24:31.191,What are you doing?
01:24:43.954,01:24:47.583,I just came to see your show.
01:24:50.293,01:25:00.721,I have to-- Ramona!
01:25:01.805,01:25:03.807,Ramona!
01:25:03.807,01:25:06.476,I need to tell you something.
01:25:06.476,01:25:16.779,"Great. Listen, I know you play mysterious and aloof just to avoid getting hurt, and I know you have reasons for not wanting to talk about your past and-- I want you to know I don't care about any of that stuff."
01:25:16.779,01:25:19.531,Because I'm in lesbians with you.
01:25:19.531,01:25:21.033,What?
01:25:21.033,01:25:22.785,"I really, really mean it."
01:25:24.453,01:25:26.455,Oh. Okay.
01:25:26.455,01:25:29.541,- Your turn.
01:25:29.541,01:25:31.376,That we have to break up.
01:25:31.376,01:25:33.587,What?
01:25:33.587,01:25:35.839,It's Gideon.
01:25:35.839,01:25:42.012,I just can't-- I can't help myself around him.
01:25:42.012,01:25:44.640,That's the bad news. Hey.
01:25:44.640,01:25:49.103,The good news is that I'm officially loving the Sex Bombs.
01:25:49.103,01:25:51.313,- Bob-Ombs.
01:25:51.313,01:25:53.273,with a smokin'-hot redhead on drums.
01:25:53.273,01:25:54.942,Music to my ear holes.
01:25:54.942,01:25:57.319,You know what?
01:25:57.319,01:25:59.404,I'm not even gonna wait to see how you guys do in the final.
01:25:59.404,01:26:02.074,I'm signing you right now for a three-album contract.
01:26:02.074,01:26:05.577,See? I'm not such a bad guy after all.
01:26:05.577,01:26:08.122,You think we're gonna sell our souls to you?
01:26:08.122,01:26:09.873,"Well, guess again."
01:26:09.873,01:26:12.126,No! I can't be a part of the band with this douche in charge.
01:26:12.126,01:26:15.129,Dou-- Ow.
01:26:15.129,01:26:17.380,"You gotta try to keep your emotions in check, man."
01:26:17.380,01:26:20.550,Don't let what's past ruin your future.
01:26:20.550,01:26:22.594,"The people need to hear us, Scott."
01:26:22.594,01:26:24.805,Then you're gonna have to find someone else to play bass.
01:26:24.805,01:26:27.683,- Whoops.
01:26:28.976,01:26:32.562,"Sign, sign, sign."
01:26:32.562,01:26:35.482,"Sweetie, shall we?"
01:26:41.155,01:26:43.699,"Oh, Scott."
01:26:43.699,01:26:46.660,"Yo, we really should be thanking each other."
01:26:46.660,01:26:49.454,"I mean, if it wasn't for me, Ramona would never have been with you."
01:26:49.454,01:26:51.414,"But if it wasn't for you, she wouldn't have gotten back with me."
01:26:51.414,01:26:54.126,"So I guess it all shakes out, huh?"
01:26:54.126,01:26:56.461,"Oh. Scotty, buddy."
01:26:59.131,01:27:09.349,"Between you and I, the whole League of Evil Exes thing-- I was in a really dark place when I put that together so-- Forgiven?"
01:27:09.349,01:27:12.061,"All right, let's go!"
01:27:12.061,01:27:14.146,Yes!
01:27:14.146,01:27:17.524,"This is it, guys."
01:27:17.524,01:27:19.193,"Mm-hmm. Yes, indeed."
01:27:20.861,01:27:23.113,I said lesbians.
01:27:51.141,01:27:53.268,Scott?
01:27:53.268,01:27:54.937,Was she really the one?
01:27:54.937,01:27:57.064,The what?
01:27:57.064,01:27:59.191,"I mean, did you really see a future with this girl?"
01:28:00.400,01:28:04.113,"Like, with jet packs."
01:28:09.826,01:28:12.704,"Time heals all wounds, little brother."
01:28:12.704,01:28:17.333,"Maybe next time, we don't date the girl with 11 evil ex-boyfriends."
01:28:17.333,01:28:18.460,Seven.
01:28:18.460,01:28:20.129,"Oh, that's not that bad."
01:28:22.005,01:28:24.258,"Hey. Yeah, I know."
01:28:24.258,01:28:26.718,"Oh, it's so pathetic."
01:28:29.345,01:28:32.266,Turn off the light!
01:28:34.392,01:28:37.437,"Presumably, you just saw some guy's junk."
01:28:37.437,01:28:39.856,And I apologize for that.
01:28:39.856,01:28:42.276,And he apologizes too.
01:28:44.069,01:28:46.738,"Scott, you know I love you."
01:28:46.738,01:28:49.365,But I'm gonna need my own bed tonight.
01:28:49.365,01:28:52.244,It's for sex.
01:28:52.244,01:28:54.329,Right.
01:28:54.329,01:28:57.666,I may need it for the rest of the week too.
01:28:57.666,01:28:59.668,Right.
01:28:59.668,01:29:01.586,I get it.
01:29:01.586,01:29:03.463,Maybe you can move in with Ramona.
01:29:03.463,01:29:07.467,She's with Gideon.
01:29:07.467,01:29:09.803,It's probably just because he's better than you.
01:29:09.803,01:29:11.554,Mmm.
01:29:11.554,01:29:14.016,"Either way, this fight is over."
01:29:14.016,01:29:17.186,Mm-hmm.
01:29:22.941,01:29:25.652,It's for Scott.
01:29:25.652,01:29:27.570,"It's for you, big guy."
01:29:29.906,01:29:32.575,Hello.
01:29:32.575,01:29:35.329,I just wanna say I feel terrible about earlier.
01:29:35.329,01:29:37.413,I don't want any hard feelings.
01:29:37.413,01:29:40.625,So I figured why not be the bigger man and just give you a call.
01:29:40.625,01:29:44.754,- Is Ramona with you?
01:29:44.754,01:29:46.965,Are you with me?
01:29:46.965,01:29:48.591,Yeah.
01:29:50.010,01:29:52.762,"Geez, buddy, it's gonna be all right."
01:29:52.762,01:29:55.598,"No, I just spilled hot cocoa on my crotch."
01:29:55.598,01:29:59.936,"Mm-hmm. Listen, as you know, I'm opening a new Chaos Theatre in Toronto."
01:29:59.936,01:30:05.399,"The Sex Pops are playing our grand opening tonight, and it would feel really weird for all of us if you weren't there."
01:30:05.399,01:30:08.987,"They just did a sound check, and the acoustics in here are amazing."
01:30:08.987,01:30:10.655,"Yeah, maybe I'll see you there."
01:30:10.655,01:30:12.199,"I hope so, amigo."
01:30:12.199,01:30:14.659,I don't want any more bad blood between exes.
01:30:14.659,01:30:16.995,What do you say?
01:30:16.995,01:30:19.289,"Okay, laters."
01:30:19.289,01:30:21.541,What a perfect asshole.
01:30:22.834,01:30:24.460,Forget what I said earlier.
01:30:24.460,01:30:26.380,Finish him.
01:30:49.443,01:30:51.071,Password.
01:30:51.071,01:30:52.572,Whatever.
01:30:52.572,01:30:53.949,Cool.
01:30:58.203,01:30:59.495,Second password.
01:31:02.749,01:31:04.000,Cool.
01:31:11.383,01:31:14.136,"No, no. The first album is much better than the first album."
01:31:14.136,01:31:16.888,No fun!
01:31:16.888,01:31:20.142,- No fun!
01:31:25.314,01:31:27.316,Scott! Let it go.
01:31:27.316,01:31:29.025,Don't give him the satisfaction.
01:31:29.025,01:31:31.694,What if I want the satisfaction?
01:31:31.694,01:31:34.530,Scott Pilgrim!
01:31:34.530,01:31:37.784,"Buddy, welcome to the Chaos Theatre."
01:31:37.784,01:31:41.288,Somebody get this man a drink.
01:31:46.542,01:31:48.628,I'm not here to drink!
01:31:48.628,01:31:50.713,Whoa. I've got no beef with you.
01:31:50.713,01:31:53.967,"Well, what if I have a beef..."
01:31:53.967,01:31:57.471,Are you still mad about the whole thing with the guild?
01:31:57.471,01:32:01.308,- You mean the league?
01:32:01.308,01:32:04.727,- I'll show you how ancient of history it is.
01:32:04.727,01:32:07.230,"There's no use crying over spilled Coke, buddy."
01:32:07.230,01:32:11.943,"The lady made her choice, and we're all just gonna have to... move on."
01:32:11.943,01:32:15.197,"- Well, I ain't moving, buddy."
01:32:15.197,01:32:18.741,You want to fight me...
01:32:18.741,01:32:20.327,Was that not clear?
01:32:23.205,01:32:25.707,Was that not clear?
01:32:25.707,01:32:27.876,"Now, why on earth..."
01:32:27.876,01:32:30.879,would you wanna do...
01:32:30.879,01:32:33.215,Because I'm in love with her.
01:32:33.215,01:32:37.260,earned the power of love!
01:32:44.558,01:32:47.020,"Aw, I think this deserves a song."
01:32:47.020,01:32:50.690,- Kimberly!
01:32:50.690,01:32:53.609,We are here to make money and sell out and stuff.
01:32:53.609,01:32:55.653,"One, two, three, four!"
01:33:44.369,01:33:46.662,Burn! Burn! Burn!
01:33:52.710,01:33:54.129,"Your club sucks, by the way."
01:33:54.129,01:33:57.757,"Well, if my cathedral of cutting-edge taste..."
01:33:57.757,01:34:10.437,"holds no interest for your tragically Canadian sensibilities, then I shall be forced to grant you a swift exit from the premises-- and a fast entrance into hell!"
01:34:13.356,01:34:15.942,Oh!
01:34:15.942,01:34:19.321,Knives?
01:34:19.321,01:34:21.406,You'll pay for what you did to him!
01:34:21.406,01:34:26.620,"Listen, Kung Pao chicken, your old old boyfriend brought this all on himself."
01:34:26.620,01:34:29.747,"He was warned plenty of times, but did he listen? No."
01:34:29.747,01:34:32.750,I'm not talking to you!
01:34:32.750,01:34:34.043,What?
01:34:34.043,01:34:36.670,You broke the heart that broke mine.
01:34:36.670,01:34:38.256,Get ready to Chau down!
01:34:43.719,01:34:46.431,"You're kidding, right?"
01:34:47.974,01:34:52.646,"Wow. I mean, you can't say I don't know how to put on a show, right?"
01:34:52.646,01:34:54.606,That's incredible!
01:35:04.782,01:35:07.118,What the hell is your deal?
01:35:09.412,01:35:10.455,You stole him!
01:35:12.248,01:35:15.210,- Stole him!
01:35:15.210,01:35:17.879,You lie!
01:35:17.879,01:35:21.924,I didn't steal your boyfriend.
01:35:21.924,01:35:24.260,I didn't steal anyone!
01:35:24.260,01:35:28.598,You did! You're just a disgusting slut!
01:35:31.601,01:35:35.230,"- You steal my boyfriend and then-- - Wait, wait! Wait!"
01:35:35.230,01:35:38.692,Can we please stop all this fighting?
01:35:38.692,01:35:41.486,"Knives, I dated you, and then I dated Ramona, okay?"
01:35:43.154,01:35:47.659,"I mean, maybe I forgot to tell Knives right away."
01:35:47.659,01:35:50.078,"You cheated on me, Scott?"
01:35:51.496,01:35:54.249,You cheated on both of us?
01:35:54.249,01:35:56.834,- You cheated on me with Knives?
01:35:58.378,01:36:01.256,cheated on Knives with you.
01:36:01.256,01:36:02.965,Is there a difference?
01:36:02.965,01:36:05.677,You weren't wronged?
01:36:05.677,01:36:07.345,Right?
01:36:08.388,01:36:10.973,- Game over.
01:36:16.020,01:36:17.480,Scotty.
01:36:17.480,01:36:23.152,"You can cheat on these ladies all you like, but you can't..."
01:36:23.152,01:36:24.946,cheat...
01:36:24.946,01:36:26.489,death.
01:36:33.538,01:36:35.873,"Oh, man."
01:36:35.873,01:36:38.251,Sorry.
01:36:38.251,01:36:40.044,Dying's gotta suck.
01:36:40.044,01:36:41.671,You know what sucks?
01:36:41.671,01:36:43.423,Getting killed by that guy.
01:36:44.549,01:36:46.384,Why him?
01:36:46.384,01:36:48.052,It's complicated.
01:36:48.052,01:36:53.433,"Well, I'm not going anywhere, so-- Now might be a good time to get into it."
01:36:54.643,01:36:58.688,"The truth is, it was me who was obsessed."
01:37:00.315,01:37:02.692,I was crazy about him.
01:37:02.692,01:37:05.320,He ignored me.
01:37:05.320,01:37:08.239,I was more alone when we were together than I ever was on my own.
01:37:09.741,01:37:12.452,That's why I had to leave.
01:37:12.452,01:37:15.622,And that's when he started paying attention.
01:37:15.622,01:37:17.206,So why go back?
01:37:17.206,01:37:19.417,"I can't help myself around him, Scott."
01:37:19.417,01:37:20.960,He just...
01:37:20.960,01:37:23.004,has this way of getting into my head.
01:37:23.004,01:37:26.048,"Well, that's legitimately disappointing."
01:37:26.048,01:37:28.510,I really will leave you alone forever now.
01:37:28.510,01:37:31.137,"No, I mean he literally has a way of getting into my head."
01:37:32.430,01:37:34.683,That is evil.
01:37:34.683,01:37:38.394,"I didn't mean for you to get dragged into this, Scott."
01:37:40.021,01:37:41.855,I just wanted something simple.
01:37:43.650,01:37:45.485,I'm sorry it had to end this way.
01:37:46.653,01:37:48.446,"Well, I really fought for you."
01:37:48.446,01:37:51.199,Maybe I'm not the one you should have been fighting for.
01:37:54.243,01:37:55.662,What?
01:37:55.662,01:37:57.706,But-- But...
01:37:59.040,01:38:01.125,I feel like I learned something.
01:38:02.711,01:38:04.587,Which would be great if I wasn't dead.
01:38:06.715,01:38:10.134,So-- So alone.
01:38:10.134,01:38:13.805,You're not alone.
01:38:13.805,01:38:15.348,Right!
01:38:24.982,01:38:26.526,Your hair looks stupid.
01:38:28.778,01:38:30.822,Second password.
01:38:34.325,01:38:36.536,- The comic book is better than the movie. Hello.
01:38:39.706,01:38:42.417,- Scott! Let it go.
01:38:42.417,01:38:45.628,"Stephen, the new line-up rocks."
01:38:45.628,01:38:47.422,"Young Neil, you have learned well."
01:38:47.422,01:38:49.716,"From this point forward, you will be known as..."
01:38:49.716,01:38:50.966,Neil.
01:38:50.966,01:38:54.721,"And, Kim, I'm sorry about everything."
01:38:56.431,01:38:57.891,I'm sorry about me.
01:38:59.434,01:39:01.477,Scott Pilgrim!
01:39:01.477,01:39:03.646,Save it.
01:39:03.646,01:39:06.065,This club sucks.
01:39:06.065,01:39:08.651,- Let's do it.
01:39:09.652,01:39:13.406,You want to fight me...
01:39:13.406,01:39:15.157,No.
01:39:15.157,01:39:17.702,I want to fight you for me.
01:39:17.702,01:39:19.995,Scott earned the power of self-respect.
01:39:22.665,01:39:24.834,- Um-- - Kim!
01:39:24.834,01:39:26.419,We are Sex Bob-Omb!
01:39:26.419,01:39:29.505,And we are here to watch Scott Pilgrim kick your teeth in!
01:39:29.505,01:39:30.882,"One, two, three, four!"
01:39:52.194,01:39:54.572,- How's it going back there?
01:39:54.572,01:39:56.783,You... dick.
01:39:57.951,01:40:00.328,Knives? I know you're in here.
01:40:00.328,01:40:03.706,- Don't attack Ramona.
01:40:04.874,01:40:08.085,Steal my boyfriend?
01:40:09.629,01:40:11.673,- Enough!
01:40:11.673,01:40:14.592,"This fat-ass hurt me, and I will have my revenge!"
01:40:14.592,01:40:16.636,"No, Knives, I hurt you."
01:40:16.636,01:40:18.471,I cheated on you.
01:40:18.471,01:40:21.557,I cheated on both of you.
01:40:23.559,01:40:25.436,I'm really sorry.
01:40:25.436,01:40:27.438,And you're not a fat-ass.
01:40:27.438,01:40:30.191,She didn't mean that.
01:40:32.777,01:40:35.279,- So are we all good?
01:40:36.948,01:40:38.908,Never felt better.
01:40:38.908,01:40:41.243,Yoo-hoo!
01:40:41.243,01:40:44.079,Are we done with the hugging and learning?
01:40:44.079,01:40:46.875,I thought we had a fight going on here!
01:40:46.875,01:40:48.960,"Oh, you've got a fight, all right."
01:40:49.961,01:40:51.587,"Wrong move, baby."
01:41:23.452,01:41:26.455,You made me swallow my gum.
01:41:28.332,01:41:32.085,It's gonna be in my digestive tract for seven years!
01:42:15.671,01:42:18.257,Yeah. Still my girl.
01:42:21.469,01:42:23.054,Let's both be girls.
01:42:26.557,01:42:30.311,Bad! Bad! Bad!
01:42:41.572,01:42:43.282,What?
01:42:55.878,01:42:58.673,Good! Good! Good!
01:43:18.151,01:43:21.112,"Who do you think you are, Pilgrim?"
01:43:21.112,01:43:24.532,You think you're better than me?
01:43:24.532,01:43:28.661,I'll tell you what you are-- a pain in my ass!
01:43:29.745,01:43:33.415,Do you know how long it took...
01:43:33.415,01:43:38.713,"to get all the evil exes' contact information, so I could form this stupid league?"
01:43:38.713,01:43:40.631,"Like, two hours!"
01:43:40.631,01:43:42.884,Two hours!
01:43:45.469,01:43:47.763,You're not cool enough for Ramona.
01:43:47.763,01:43:50.223,You're zero!
01:43:50.223,01:43:53.561,Me? I'm what's hip.
01:43:53.561,01:43:55.980,I'm blowing up right now!
01:43:55.980,01:44:00.317,You are blowing up-- - right now!
01:44:00.317,01:44:03.445,K.O.! K.O.! K.O.!
01:44:11.829,01:44:17.793,Wow!
01:44:17.793,01:44:21.797,Yeah. Wow.
01:44:28.888,01:44:30.514,There goes our deal.
01:44:30.514,01:44:32.850,"We're still gettin' paid, right?"
01:44:32.850,01:44:34.936,There goes our deal.
01:44:34.936,01:44:36.187,Oh.
01:44:36.187,01:44:37.521,"Oh, God!"
01:44:47.656,01:44:51.244,You two make a good combo.
01:44:51.244,01:44:53.996,Yeah?
01:44:53.996,01:44:57.083,Scott Pilgrim.
01:44:59.668,01:45:07.468,"You can defeat me, Scott, but can you defeat yourself?"
01:45:11.847,01:45:13.933,Uh-oh.
01:45:13.933,01:45:15.977,Nega Scott.
01:45:21.398,01:45:22.942,No.
01:45:22.942,01:45:27.404,This is something I have to face...
01:45:27.404,01:45:29.282,myself.
01:45:35.079,01:45:36.956,They have this incredible French toast...
01:45:36.956,01:45:38.540,"with, like, bananas on it."
01:45:38.540,01:45:41.294,You can get bacon on the side.
01:45:41.294,01:45:43.378,"Well, let's do it next week."
01:45:43.378,01:45:45.464,"All right, be good."
01:45:45.464,01:45:47.883,Hey.
01:45:47.883,01:45:50.261,- What happened?
01:45:50.261,01:45:52.345,We just shot the shit.
01:45:52.345,01:45:54.556,We're gonna get brunch next week.
01:45:54.556,01:45:56.349,We-- We actually have a lot in common.
01:45:56.349,01:45:59.394,Your hair-- it's getting really shaggy.
01:45:59.394,01:46:01.647,It is?
01:46:03.565,01:46:05.193,You should probably get it cut.
01:46:05.193,01:46:07.444,"Yeah, you're right."
01:46:07.444,01:46:09.197,I should get it cut.
01:46:09.197,01:46:11.032,At a salon.
01:46:11.032,01:46:13.242,"A salon, yeah."
01:46:13.242,01:46:16.578,Hey. You're-- You're goin'?
01:46:17.830,01:46:19.581,I should probably disappear.
01:46:19.581,01:46:21.458,After all that?
01:46:21.458,01:46:25.004,I still need a new life.
01:46:25.004,01:46:27.548,"I came here to escape, but the past keeps catching up."
01:46:29.466,01:46:31.510,I'm tired of people getting hurt because of me.
01:46:31.510,01:46:33.929,"Oh, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get over it."
01:46:33.929,01:46:36.807,I don't mean just you.
01:46:39.227,01:46:40.811,"No, I understand."
01:46:43.189,01:46:44.732,"I should thank you, though."
01:46:44.732,01:46:46.525,For what?
01:46:48.361,01:46:51.364,For being the nicest guy I ever dated.
01:46:53.199,01:46:55.117,That's kind of sad.
01:46:57.745,01:47:00.289,It is kind of sad.
01:47:00.289,01:47:04.043,"Well, bye and stuff."
01:47:05.627,01:47:06.879,Yeah.
01:47:08.172,01:47:09.506,And stuff.
01:47:14.469,01:47:15.888,Go get her.
01:47:17.390,01:47:18.933,What?
01:47:18.933,01:47:21.434,You've been fighting for her all along.
01:47:23.687,01:47:25.189,But what about you?
01:47:25.189,01:47:27.691,I'll be fine.
01:47:32.113,01:47:34.073,I'm too cool for you anyway.
01:47:39.036,01:47:40.288,"Ciao, Knives."
01:47:40.288,01:47:42.748,Go.
01:47:48.003,01:47:50.381,Hey. Hey.
01:47:50.381,01:47:52.007,Mind if I tag along?
01:47:54.009,01:47:57.263,You wanna come with me?
01:47:57.263,01:48:00.599,Thought maybe we could try again.
01:48:23.496,01:48:33.548,"Continue? Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one."
01:49:53.128,01:49:57.383,with their bodies.
