00:08:34.848,00:08:39.560,"I'm dead serious. Sometimes, I just sit for hours just staring at the sky trying to come up with something to do."
00:08:39.644,00:08:42.439,I even don't know if she can walk. I've never seen her standing up.
00:08:42.481,00:08:44.232,I've only seen her on her back.

00:09:20.268,00:09:25.732,spirits or something. Our-- our souls were connected in this way-- I can't describe it. Time stood still.
00:09:25.815,00:09:28.109,It was like we were sharing the same heart.
00:09:28.193,00:09:31.863,"Stop! Man, why do you always come and kill the vibe with those things?"
00:09:31.946,00:09:34.032,Sharing the same heart? That's like some...

00:09:54.010,00:09:58.139,"Will you please help him redeem himself, - by telling him a real sex story? - Yes."

00:13:58.630,00:14:02.342,"Andy, don't let them bother you. It's okay not to have sex."
00:14:02.425,00:14:04.552,Not everybody is a pussy magnet.
00:14:04.636,00:14:06.596,"You, uh-- what are you?"
00:14:06.680,00:14:08.640,- 25? - I'm 40.
00:14:08.723,00:14:11.267,"Holy shit, man, you've got to get on that."
00:14:11.351,00:14:16.731,Life isn't about sex. Life is about children - and passion. - Yeah.
00:14:16.815,00:14:19.567,"- And spirit. - Yeah, life's about passion."
00:14:19.651,00:14:21.944,It's not about fucking and balls and pussy.
00:14:22.028,00:14:24.322,It's about love.
00:14:24.405,00:14:27.492,It's about people. It's about connection.
00:14:27.575,00:14:31.162,- It's all about connections. - It's not about cock and ass and tits...
00:14:31.245,00:14:33.080,- Mm-hmm. - ...and butthole pleasures.
00:14:33.164,00:14:35.082,It's not about butthole pleasures at all.
00:14:35.166,00:14:38.085,It's not about this rusty trombone and the dirty Sanchez...
00:14:38.169,00:14:41.172,- Please stop. - ...the Cincinnati bowtie...
00:14:41.255,00:14:47.136,"- Mooj. - ...and your pussy-juice caulking - and the shit-stained balls. - Mooj, just please stop."
00:14:47.220,00:14:49.096,"- It's relax-- - All right, that's enough."
00:14:49.180,00:14:52.183,Party's over. Let the virgin get back to work.
00:14:56.688,00:14:58.981,"Andy! Andy, come on!"
00:14:59.065,00:15:00.775,We were just kidding!
00:15:00.859,00:15:04.070,"- Sorry. - Andy, nobody cares that you're a virgin!"
00:15:04.153,00:15:05.822,Don't be such a baby!
00:15:05.905,00:15:08.324,They were just having fun! They didn't mean anything!
00:15:08.408,00:15:10.368,"- Get away from me, David. - Wait a minute!"
00:15:10.451,00:15:12.119,- Stop following me! - Hold up.
00:15:14.330,00:15:15.998,Andy: Shit.
00:15:16.082,00:15:18.292,- Whoa. - I'm gonna have to quit my job now.
00:15:18.376,00:15:20.920,- You don't have to quit. - I don't wanna go out with you guys!
00:15:21.003,00:15:23.256,- Fine. Okay. - I don't need your help!
00:15:23.339,00:15:25.299,All right. You don't have to go out with us if you don't want.
00:15:25.383,00:15:27.427,"I respect women, I love women."
00:15:27.510,00:15:30.971,I respect them so much that I completely stay away from them.
00:15:31.055,00:15:33.933,- Okay. - I have a very fulfilling life.
00:15:42.400,00:15:44.652,"Get some road burn, come on!"
00:15:44.736,00:15:47.238,"Come on, sucker!"
00:15:57.957,00:16:02.044,- So how could this not have happened? - It just never happened.
00:16:02.128,00:16:07.675,"When I was young... uh, I tried, and it didn't happen. And uh..."
00:16:07.759,00:16:15.558,"then, I got older, and I got more and more nervous because it hadn't happened yet, and I got-- kind of-- weirded out about it."
00:16:15.642,00:16:20.521,"Then it really didn't happen, and-- then, I don't know. I just kind of stopped trying."
00:16:20.605,00:16:23.190,Do you wanna give it another shot?
00:16:23.274,00:16:25.318,Maybe it's too late.
00:16:25.401,00:16:28.905,Bec-- I-- sometimes I feel that it is just too late for me.
00:16:28.988,00:16:31.324,"Oh... no, that's cra-- that's crazy."
00:16:31.407,00:16:34.577,"You're 40 years old. You know, 40's the new 20."
00:16:34.661,00:16:45.546,"You wanna spend the next 60 years of your life never experiencing sex? And not just sex, but-- but love, and a relationship, and laughing, and-- and cuddling and all that shit."
00:16:45.630,00:16:51.552,"I don't know, I-- - I wouldn't know what to do. - Look, you gotta take a risk."
00:16:51.636,00:17:00.227,"You gotta risk it. Look at me, I went out with this girl for four months, and it was the greatest-- greatest thing in my life."
00:17:00.311,00:17:04.440,"Until she went down on this guy in an Escalade, I think."
00:17:04.524,00:17:09.654,"And you know, instead of like saying, Okay, what I am doing that caused this behavior?"
00:17:09.737,00:17:14.283,I dumped her. Stupid decision-- I spent the last two years of my life regretting it.
00:17:14.367,00:17:16.076,"Then, why don't you get her back right now?"
00:17:16.160,00:17:18.663,"Oh, 'cause she's dating this pot dealer."
00:17:18.746,00:17:20.373,"It's a stupid, horrible decision."
00:17:20.456,00:17:22.333,"But hey, that's her journey, you know?"
00:17:22.416,00:17:24.836,I gotta respect that. I gotta give her the space.
00:17:24.919,00:17:29.757,"If she wants to be some immature, little bitch and blow everybody, that's-- that's love, man."
00:17:29.841,00:17:32.051,- That sounds horrible. - Of course it's horrible.
00:17:32.134,00:17:44.438,"It's suffering, it's pain, and it's-- you know, you lose weight, and you put back on weight, and then you call 'em a bunch of times, and you're trying to e-mail her, and then they move, they change their e-mail, but that's just love."
00:17:44.522,00:17:49.944,"Do you realize that this is the first time we've spoken - for more than, like, 30 seconds? - Uh-huh."
00:17:50.028,00:17:53.907,"- God, it's kind of nice. - Come out with us this weekend."
00:17:53.990,00:17:56.158,"No pressure, we'll just have a good time."
00:17:56.242,00:17:58.828,"Okay, yeah, I will."
00:17:58.912,00:18:00.830,- I'll give it a shot. - Great.
00:18:00.914,00:18:02.957,But I am not going to have sex with anybody.
00:18:03.041,00:18:05.960,"Good, sex should be the last thing on your mind."
00:18:26.188,00:18:27.857,"Okay, that's not right."
00:18:33.571,00:18:35.489,"Oh, come on, bus!"
00:18:42.747,00:18:45.041,"Oh, come on, dogs!"
00:18:47.794,00:18:50.170,"Shit, you gotta be kidding me."
00:19:05.979,00:19:08.188,"I mean, I'm kind of nervous."
00:19:08.272,00:19:10.024,I never had oral sex before.
00:19:10.108,00:19:12.192,Jennifer told me how to do it.
00:19:12.276,00:19:14.862,It's gonna kick ass.
00:19:21.243,00:19:23.913,- You know what else is sexy? - What?
00:19:23.997,00:19:25.915,- Me... - Yeah?
00:19:28.459,00:19:31.796,...on your...
00:19:31.879,00:19:33.756,"- toe. - Oh, that's what you wanna suck on?"
00:19:38.136,00:19:40.554,- ...thick. - Okay.
00:19:47.854,00:19:50.272,"Oh, no no no-- I'm-- your nose is bleeding."
00:19:50.356,00:19:52.232,- You think? - I'm sorry.
00:19:52.316,00:19:54.027,You are terrible at this!
00:19:56.029,00:19:58.072,Oh God! Oh...
00:19:58.156,00:20:00.908,G-- oh.
00:20:04.745,00:20:08.166,"- Cal, what do you think? Is this too yellow? - No."
00:20:08.248,00:20:12.252,"- What's Curious George like in real life? - Come on, man."
00:20:21.554,00:20:24.182,"Wow, this is, uh, pretty crowded."
00:20:24.264,00:20:27.977,"Yeah, well, it's nine dollar beer night."
00:20:28.061,00:20:31.814,"Okay, look here. So this is what's about to happen, a'ight?"
00:20:31.898,00:20:34.775,"You're about to go run down some drunk chicks, a'ight?"
00:20:34.859,00:20:37.277,Don't confuse that with tipsy. We're talking about drunk.
00:20:37.361,00:20:42.200,"I want vomit in the hair, bruised-up knees-- a broken heel is a plus. That's what you wanna find, okay?"
00:20:42.282,00:20:46.370,"- If things-- - No, Dave already told me I didn't have to have sex tonight. And now he's gone, so..."
00:20:46.453,00:20:48.455,"Dude, stop thinking for a minute, a'ight?"
00:20:48.539,00:20:50.208,- You ain't got the think on this one. - Yeah?
00:20:50.290,00:20:51.959,All you got to do is use your instinct.
00:20:52.043,00:20:54.754,How do you think a lion knows to tackle a gazelle?
00:20:54.837,00:20:57.882,It's written. It's a code written in his DNA.
00:20:57.965,00:20:59.926,- It says Tackle the gazelle. - Okay.
00:21:00.009,00:21:04.304,"And believe it or not, in every man there's a code written that says Tackle drunk bitches."
00:21:04.388,00:21:06.306,"N-- oh God, you know what?"
00:21:09.936,00:21:13.147,"...hitting on drunk bitches. You know, I don't think that's right."
00:21:13.231,00:21:17.526,"Okay. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Now, first of all, you making it up to be some kind of bad thing."
00:21:17.610,00:21:19.612,I didn't use bitches in the derogatory sense you did.
00:21:19.695,00:21:22.156,It just doesn't-- this doesn't feel right.
00:21:22.240,00:21:25.118,"Of course, it don't feel right. What has felt right for you doesn't work."
00:21:25.201,00:21:27.411,"You need to try some wrong, dawg."
00:21:29.496,00:21:31.958,"Okay, how do... I tell which ones are drunk?"
00:21:36.087,00:21:44.762,So we just decided-- because this is my last night as a free woman before I marry Dan-- that we would just wig out! We're wigging out!
00:21:46.139,00:21:49.100,You guys are hilarious.
00:21:49.183,00:21:52.770,"Whoa whoa whoa! Wait a minute. Yes yes, Mr. President?"
00:21:52.853,00:21:55.231,"Yes yes, the election results are in."
00:21:55.273,00:21:58.985,"Hey, guys, look. It's Dr. Seuss' penis."
00:21:59.068,00:22:01.237,I really mean this.
00:22:01.320,00:22:04.240,"Hey, everybody, who wants penis cake?"
00:22:04.323,00:22:06.575,- I do. - She does.
00:22:06.659,00:22:09.745,"Hey, you guys, Betty Cocker."
00:22:11.289,00:22:18.171,"What a good guy. What a-- Dan, the guy Robin's marrying, is such a good guy."
00:22:18.254,00:22:19.922,- He sounds like a good guy. - Oh.
00:22:20.006,00:22:22.466,I hated him like for two years 'cause he cheated on me.
00:22:22.549,00:22:24.927,- Oh. - But...
00:22:26.887,00:22:29.347,he's really changed now.
00:22:29.431,00:22:31.892,He's a really good guy now.
00:22:31.976,00:22:35.938,"- Your friend seemed nice. - You have really kind eyes, you know that?"
00:22:36.022,00:22:38.065,"Thanks, um..."
00:22:38.149,00:22:40.276,your hat has sequins.
00:22:46.657,00:22:49.493,Mmm. Whoo.
00:22:53.706,00:22:56.000,- You have your hands on my belt. - What?
00:22:56.083,00:22:58.127,- Your hands are on my belt. - I'm sorry.
00:22:58.211,00:23:01.505,"- No, that's good. - You're cute."
00:23:01.588,00:23:04.466,This is kind of lame. You wanna get out of here?
00:23:07.845,00:23:08.762,Mmm.
00:23:10.223,00:23:11.849,- Mmm. Man! Fuck! - Yeah.
00:23:11.932,00:23:13.934,- Come on. - Okay.
00:23:19.315,00:23:21.817,- You wanna drive? - I don't-- um...
00:23:21.901,00:23:27.114,"- have a car with me here, so... - Oh, that's cool, I'll just suck it up!"
00:23:29.200,00:23:32.036,"- Are you drunk? - No, I didn't have anything to drink."
00:23:39.252,00:23:44.048,"- What is this? - Oh, the judge recommended I get one."
00:23:50.096,00:23:53.391,"Whoa, okay! Wow, that's fast."
00:23:56.518,00:23:59.105,"Com on, you're on the lasso!"
00:24:13.535,00:24:21.168,"And Pam's like, You are such a b-i-t-c-h-- And I'm like, You're the bitch, bitch!"
00:24:21.252,00:24:23.045,"- You know? - Uh-huh, yeah."
00:24:23.129,00:24:25.339,What was your name again?
00:24:25.423,00:24:26.548,- Andy. - Andy.
00:24:26.632,00:24:28.634,"Let me tell you something, Andy."
00:24:28.717,00:24:31.595,Don't ever be named Dan.
00:24:31.678,00:24:35.891,"Dan rhymes with man, and men jerk off, and he was a jerk-off."
00:24:35.975,00:24:37.684,"- Do you know what I mean? - Yo, look out!"
00:24:39.019,00:24:41.272,"- Andy: Wow, um... - I like you."
00:24:41.355,00:24:47.403,"I like you. You're not a jac-- Ooh, ah. Ech."
00:24:47.485,00:24:50.697,I think I ate some bad shellfish sandwich or something.
00:25:01.667,00:25:04.753,"Oh, that tasted like shellfish."
00:25:04.837,00:25:07.381,Look out! Oh! Sorry!
00:25:12.303,00:25:14.888,"- Do you think I'm pretty? - Oh, yes."
00:25:14.972,00:25:17.057,"Yo, a car! Yes, a car!"
00:25:17.141,00:25:19.435,- Oh! - You're not looking at me.
00:25:19.517,00:25:21.395,"- Yes, you're pretty. - You're not looking at me."
00:25:21.479,00:25:23.230,"- Yes, you're pretty. - Do you think I'm pretty?"
00:25:23.314,00:25:24.898,"- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - Look at me. Look at me!"
00:25:26.484,00:25:28.194,You're pretty! you're pretty!
00:25:32.323,00:25:34.700,"God, I hope I get my period soon."
00:25:34.783,00:25:37.661,I am in a bad mood.
00:25:37.744,00:25:40.831,- Okay. - I'm so tired.
00:25:40.914,00:25:43.083,Hey. Hey!
00:25:43.167,00:25:46.170,Whoa! No! No! Oh God! Out of the way!
00:25:46.253,00:25:47.880,- Oh! - Hey!
00:25:47.963,00:25:51.008,Get off the wheel. Jeez.
00:25:51.091,00:25:53.760,You're not gonna get in my pants acting like that.
00:25:53.844,00:25:56.013,I'm starving!
00:25:56.096,00:25:58.098,Let's get some fucking French toast!
00:26:00.017,00:26:02.102,"Okay, here we are."
00:26:02.186,00:26:03.854,"Oh God, we made it!"
00:26:03.937,00:26:06.940,- Woman: Home sweet home. - Yay.
00:26:13.239,00:26:16.116,- That fucker came out of nowhere! - Oh.
00:26:20.871,00:26:24.124,Are you-- are you okay?
00:26:32.716,00:26:35.969,"- I'm sorry. - Oh, that's okay."
00:26:36.053,00:26:38.514,I think I kind of had that coming.
00:26:38.596,00:26:40.682,"I'll still have sex with you, if you want."
00:26:40.766,00:26:43.519,"You know what? I think I'm gonna pass on the sex, if you don't mind."
00:26:43.601,00:26:46.188,At least I don't have to work out tomorrow.
00:26:47.356,00:26:48.648,Did you have a daiquiri tonight?
00:26:48.732,00:26:50.359,- Yeah. - I thought you might.
00:26:50.443,00:26:53.279,It was a very bad night.
00:26:53.362,00:26:55.322,"- Whoo-ah! - Yeah, laugh."
00:26:55.406,00:27:01.370,You know what? You guys wouldn't be laughing right now if some girl had just vomited shellfish sandwich into your mouth!
00:27:04.081,00:27:14.674,Let me apologize to you first of all for not mentioning in detail that when you pick up a drunk woman who's falling down on her way out of the bar that you should probably drive.
00:27:14.758,00:27:16.009,I drive a bike.
00:27:16.093,00:27:20.139,"Okay, Mr. Schwinn- fucking-Armstrong, who asked you to drive a bike?"
00:27:20.222,00:27:22.849,You know what? I'm not the only person in the world who rides a bike.
00:27:22.933,00:27:25.811,"Yeah, everyone rides a bike-- when they're fucking six."
00:27:25.894,00:27:28.021,Why don't you kiss something?
00:27:28.105,00:27:30.983,"Because this-- this is over you guys, okay?"
00:27:31.066,00:27:32.901,Can I just interject for a second?
00:27:32.985,00:27:38.324,"Let me just say, you are-- you are putting the pussy up on this pedestal. You're just building the pussy up."
00:27:38.407,00:27:40.033,What are even talking about?
00:27:40.117,00:27:41.868,Building the pussy up. What does that mean?
00:27:41.952,00:27:51.753,"You're making the pussy into this great big Greek goddess named Pussalia, and what you're doing is, you're psyching yourself into thinking it's some impossible feat."
00:27:51.837,00:27:54.798,"Yeah, I think you're right. I'm putting the pussy up on a pedestal."
00:27:54.881,00:27:58.260,"- Right. - That's it. It's Pussalia, right?"
00:27:58.344,00:28:00.887,- Look where you going. - I don't want to say the word anymore.
00:28:00.971,00:28:03.516,- Say what word? - Pussy. I don't want to say it.
00:28:03.599,00:28:05.476,Pussy is a scientific word.
00:28:05.559,00:28:08.061,"Dude! New pants, man!"
00:28:08.145,00:28:11.649,"You know what, Dave? You said there wasn't going to be any pressure."
00:28:11.773,00:28:13.567,- We're not pressuring you. - Excuse me.
00:28:13.651,00:28:15.235,Can one of you guys help me please?
00:28:15.319,00:28:18.071,"- No hablo English, lady. - Oh."
00:28:18.155,00:28:20.324,I actually am helping a customer right now.
00:28:20.407,00:28:26.246,"- Okay, well, um... - I'm on break, but our stock supervisor is very knowledgeable."
00:28:26.330,00:28:28.706,He can answer all your questions and he'd love to help you.
00:28:28.790,00:28:30.917,"- Oh, thank you. You too. - Have a nice day."
00:28:31.001,00:28:34.338,"Uh, great, okay. Hi, I'm Trish."
00:28:34.421,00:28:36.798,Hi. Andy...is my name.
00:28:36.882,00:28:38.467,This one looks pretty good.
00:28:38.551,00:28:40.760,- You don't want to buy that VCR. - I don't?
00:28:40.844,00:28:45.849,"No, actually to be totally honest with you, you don't want to buy any VCR. It's a dead technology."
00:28:45.932,00:28:49.102,"- It's, you know, like getting... - What the hell?"
00:28:49.186,00:28:51.104,- ...an 8-track player... - Yeah.
00:28:51.188,00:28:54.650,or a beta-max. Actually I'd recommend this one.
00:28:54.733,00:28:59.071,This is a dual. You've got the VCR and DVD combo.
00:28:59.154,00:29:05.869,"So, you know, that technology will probably be pretty good for-- - Six months or so? That's good. - Yeah."
00:29:05.952,00:29:08.080,At best. Sorry.
00:29:08.163,00:29:10.583,- No no no. - This is as good as it gets.
00:29:10.666,00:29:12.418,"- Okay, that sounds good then. - Okay."
00:29:12.501,00:29:14.794,"- Excusa, por favor. - Oh, sorry."
00:29:14.878,00:29:17.506,Coming through. Muchas gracias.
00:29:17.590,00:29:23.803,"God, you know, it's so funny. I work right across the street, - and I've never been in this place. - Oh, really? Where at?"
00:29:23.887,00:29:25.598,The We Sell Your Stuff On eBay store.
00:29:25.681,00:29:28.767,"Oh, that's the name?"
00:29:28.850,00:29:31.311,"Yeah. Yeah, I was looking for something..."
00:29:31.395,00:29:34.231,"you know, obvious, so I chose that."
00:29:34.314,00:29:37.317,I don't understand. So what-- you do what?
00:29:37.401,00:29:40.904,"I take the stuff that you don't want, and then I sell it on eBay."
00:29:40.987,00:29:44.199,But you don't actually sell anything in the store?
00:29:44.283,00:29:46.493,"No no, I don't."
00:29:46.577,00:29:48.328,So why do you have a store?
00:29:50.664,00:29:56.878,"No, I think it's because, you know, I wanna maybe look professional and not like a crazy person who's just going to steal all your shit."
00:29:56.962,00:29:59.465,Sure. I didn't mean anything by that.
00:29:59.548,00:30:01.675,"No no, it's okay. You know what?"
00:30:01.759,00:30:04.010,"You should come by sometime if you want, you know?"
00:30:04.094,00:30:06.221,"- All right, I'll-- - See for yourself. Check it out."
00:30:06.305,00:30:08.181,I'll check out your empty store.
00:30:08.265,00:30:10.768,"Yeah, it's the one across the street that's not empty."
00:30:12.770,00:30:15.355,"- Here's my number, so... - All right."
00:30:15.439,00:30:17.483,So just any time.
00:30:17.566,00:30:20.402,Why do I need your number if you're across the street?
00:30:20.486,00:30:22.279,Um...
00:30:22.362,00:30:24.657,"I don't really have a good answer for that, Andy."
00:30:24.740,00:30:27.200,- Sorry. - I'm just giving it to you.
00:30:27.284,00:30:30.287,So I'll write you up and meet you over at the register.
00:30:30.370,00:30:32.456,- Okay. - Check you out-- check out.
00:30:32.539,00:30:34.374,"- See you over there, okay. - Okay."
00:30:34.458,00:30:39.588,"- Awful chatty. - Hey, that-- I-- look, I think she gave me her number."
00:30:39.672,00:30:42.257,"I mean, she wrote down her number, but I think she gave me her number."
00:30:42.341,00:30:44.384,"Oh no, she gave you-- dude, see?"
00:30:44.468,00:30:46.428,- You still mad at me? - I was never mad.
00:30:46.512,00:30:48.888,"See what I mean? We gonna celebrate, man!"
00:30:48.972,00:30:50.766,- This is pretty cool. - Yeah!
00:30:50.849,00:30:54.227,"Give him some credit, man. The man pulled a number."
00:30:54.311,00:30:56.896,"It's just, I was-- I can't believe that happened."
00:30:56.980,00:31:00.567,- What you did was you zoned in. - She just gave me her number.
00:31:00.651,00:31:06.114,"That's great, man. I'm telling you - love is a mysterious fig. - It is."
00:31:06.198,00:31:09.493,"Okay, here's a question. When should I call her?"
00:31:09.576,00:31:12.329,"You like her? Yeah, you definitely don't want to call her."
00:31:12.412,00:31:14.498,When is the next Olympics?
00:31:14.581,00:31:20.379,"What you just got to do is just get you a bunch of these hood rats, run through them. Just knock them out-- boom boom boom."
00:31:20.462,00:31:25.801,"And once you've done slayed like 20-30 of them hood rats, now you're ready to go up to the upper-echelon-type ho."
00:31:25.884,00:31:27.594,- You know what I mean? - I'm not a big ho runner.
00:31:27.678,00:31:29.929,My uncle used to drive a ho runner.
00:31:30.013,00:31:38.271,"Screw these analogies. What he's saying is you are going to be so bad at sex the first time you don't want to have sex with someone you like, because they'll think you're a weirdo for being so lame at it."
00:31:38.355,00:31:46.196,"You want to have sex with hood rats first so that by the time you get to the girl you do like, you're not terrible at sex, you'll be mediocre at it."
00:31:46.279,00:31:48.365,"Probably still pretty bad, though."
00:31:48.448,00:31:50.409,Put it up for my man for pulling that number.
00:31:50.492,00:31:52.703,"- Way to go, man. - Politicked his ass off."
00:31:52.786,00:31:55.038,- He did politick. - Thanks a lot.
00:31:55.121,00:31:57.290,"Like a train, around the bend. You ready?"
00:32:31.617,00:32:33.076,Yeah!
00:32:33.159,00:32:34.620,- I can't. - Do it.
00:32:34.703,00:32:36.663,- I can't pee in public! - Gotta do it.
00:32:36.747,00:32:38.998,"- I've got a mental block about it. - Come on, do it."
00:32:44.838,00:32:48.383,I'm peeing in public!
00:32:48.467,00:32:50.969,- Let me out! - I can't hear what you're saying.
00:32:51.052,00:32:53.972,- I don't want to be in here! - It's a sound-proof room.
00:32:54.055,00:32:56.975,"- Learn his techniques. - Right on, man."
00:32:57.058,00:32:59.728,"You guys, this is not funny!"
00:33:39.017,00:33:41.227,"- Hey, what you watching? - Dawn of the Dead, man."
00:33:41.311,00:33:44.606,"- Great. - Store is slow, Paula's gone."
00:33:44.690,00:33:46.942,"- Is Paula back? - No no, she's not here."
00:33:47.025,00:33:49.402,She said we can't watch this in here. You sure?
00:33:49.486,00:33:51.488,Can I ask you something in confidence?
00:33:51.571,00:33:53.573,"I know this is gonna sound weird, um..."
00:33:53.657,00:33:55.492,am I good looking?
00:33:55.575,00:33:58.286,Do you think a woman would find me attractive?
00:33:58.370,00:34:00.580,Oh my God!
00:34:00.664,00:34:05.084,"Oh my God, the blood just squ-- - Okay, never mind. - Whoa, wait wait, Andy. Andy, hold up."
00:34:05.168,00:34:07.838,This is embarrassing for me. This is hard to talk about.
00:34:07.921,00:34:09.965,- Are you ready for my honest answer? - Yes.
00:34:10.048,00:34:13.886,Yeah. I think you're a good-looking cat.
00:34:13.969,00:34:17.096,"I don't think that anybody knows it, and I don't think anybody can see it."
00:34:17.180,00:34:21.018,That's why I'm asking you. You seem really well groomed and really put together.
00:34:21.100,00:34:23.729,"I mean, look dude, you think this was an accident?"
00:34:26.690,00:34:29.943,You got to highlight your attributes. You're like a diamond in the rough.
00:34:30.027,00:34:32.946,- You willing to make some sacrifices? - Absolutely.
00:34:33.030,00:34:35.824,See that whole Teen Wolf thing you got going right there?
00:34:35.908,00:34:37.951,"Just need to wax that right out, boom."
00:34:38.035,00:34:40.370,"- Does it hurt? - No, waxing don't hurt."
00:34:40.453,00:34:43.122,"I mean, not unless you're a bitch, you know what I mean? Didn't hurt me."
00:34:43.206,00:34:45.584,I get it done all the time. What the fuck?!
00:34:48.545,00:34:51.006,Fuck that nigga up!
00:34:51.089,00:34:54.300,"Bitch, get out the room! Bitch, get out the room!"
00:34:56.428,00:34:58.388,"No, it's gonna be good. It's gonna be good."
00:34:58.471,00:35:01.558,"- This is the one right here. - Hi, how are you?"
00:35:01.641,00:35:03.769,So this is your first time getting body wax?
00:35:03.852,00:35:05.729,"- Yes yes, it is. - Take off your shirt."
00:35:05.812,00:35:07.981,Okay.
00:35:09.942,00:35:12.360,"Oh, we're gonna need more wax!"
00:35:12.444,00:35:14.696,I'm staying. This is gonna be good.
00:35:14.780,00:35:17.991,And clear all my appointments in the afternoon!
00:35:18.075,00:35:19.659,Here we go.
00:35:19.743,00:35:21.745,"Oh, that feels warm."
00:35:24.289,00:35:28.752,Dave: I like your sweater. Does that come in a V-neck?
00:35:28.835,00:35:33.131,"Cal: If she starts doing his pubes, I'm out of here."
00:35:33.214,00:35:35.216,"Jay: You're gonna look good after this, man."
00:35:35.300,00:35:37.552,"- Thanks, man. - So, ready?"
00:35:37.636,00:35:39.512,Yeah.
00:35:39.596,00:35:41.807,"Ich, ni, san."
00:35:45.602,00:35:47.980,Oh! I'm sorry.
00:35:48.063,00:35:49.689,I'm sorry. That's just your job.
00:35:49.773,00:35:52.025,- Do you want to stop now? - No no no no.
00:35:52.109,00:35:54.111,- I'm sorry. - It's okay.
00:35:55.946,00:35:57.781,"That one little patch looks sexy, though."
00:35:57.864,00:36:00.117,"- Does it look good? - Cal: Yeah, it looks really good."
00:36:04.663,00:36:06.539,Andy: Okay.
00:36:06.623,00:36:09.167,"Whoo, wow. I didn't expect that at all."
00:36:09.250,00:36:11.336,I really didn't expect that.
00:36:11.419,00:36:14.380,Jay: You got it. The first one's the only one that hurts.
00:36:14.464,00:36:16.466,"Yeah, well those hairs are pretty deep."
00:36:16.549,00:36:18.677,- Okay. - You ready?
00:36:18.760,00:36:21.054,"- Yup. - Ich, ni, san."
00:36:25.224,00:36:28.227,"You shithead! Oh, I hate you!"
00:36:28.311,00:36:30.563,I hate you so much!
00:36:30.647,00:36:32.398,That one hurt.
00:36:32.482,00:36:34.567,That one hurt just as much as the first one.
00:36:34.651,00:36:36.569,"- That's great, man. - Andy: Man!"
00:36:38.655,00:36:41.741,"One, two, three."
00:36:46.412,00:36:49.958,in the asshole!
00:36:50.042,00:36:52.961,- Wow-wee! - I'm sorry.
00:36:53.045,00:36:55.130,I'm sorry. I really don't swear this much.
00:36:55.213,00:36:57.507,"You know what? I got a weak stomach, that's all I can take."
00:36:57.590,00:36:59.176,- I'll se y'all. - Jay? Jay?
00:36:59.258,00:37:00.844,"Be tough, Andy! You got it!"
00:37:00.927,00:37:02.846,- Where did Jay go? - Dave: He went to throw up.
00:37:02.929,00:37:04.305,- Ready? - Yup.
00:37:07.350,00:37:09.853,Cocksucker Motherfucker!
00:37:09.936,00:37:12.271,You pulled on two! You pulled on two!
00:37:12.355,00:37:14.191,Why didn't you pull on three?
00:37:14.273,00:37:17.194,Sweaty pie-hole! Cómo se llama?
00:37:17.276,00:37:19.278,"Oh, Kelly Clarkson!"
00:37:19.362,00:37:21.322,And three!
00:37:26.703,00:37:28.872,"- That's fucked up. Oh, that's fucked up. - Andy: Shit! balls!"
00:37:31.875,00:37:33.585,I hate you!
00:37:33.668,00:37:36.337,"I hate you! Stop smiling, you jerk!"
00:37:36.421,00:37:38.924,- You pussy. - Oh God!
00:37:39.007,00:37:41.885,"What's next? Oh, you're doing the nipple."
00:37:41.968,00:37:43.929,"- Oh, not the nipple. - Not the nipple."
00:37:44.012,00:37:46.014,"Please, Cal, hold my hand."
00:37:46.098,00:37:49.726,"- You kidding me, man? - Hold my goddamn hand, man!"
00:37:49.809,00:37:52.145,"Do it! Just hol-- okay, here we go."
00:37:54.313,00:37:56.566,Oh no. Yup. Yup.
00:37:56.649,00:37:58.944,"One, two, three."
00:38:01.821,00:38:05.324,"Oh, Mika, you should burn in hell!"
00:38:05.408,00:38:08.203,"Okay, all right. No seriously, I think I'm done."
00:38:08.286,00:38:10.914,I think we're done. I think that's good.
00:38:12.791,00:38:14.333,"You know what, guys?"
00:38:14.417,00:38:16.836,This is not a good look for me!
00:38:16.920,00:38:18.671,You look like a man-o-lantern.
00:38:18.755,00:38:21.258,- Thank you very much. I appreciate it. - Thank you.
00:38:39.776,00:38:43.321,- Can you get-- thank you very much. - Woman: Thank you.
00:38:43.404,00:38:46.866,"Andy, I owe you an apology, man."
00:38:46.950,00:38:51.079,I wasn't very nice to you for the past - like two and a half years. - You were nice to me.
00:38:51.163,00:38:56.209,"No, I wasn't. I thought you were really boring and I kind of thought you were a serial killer."
00:38:58.586,00:39:02.048,"Look, you shouldn't listen to Dave and Jay, okay?"
00:39:02.132,00:39:04.509,Those guys are crazy. You should listen to me.
00:39:04.592,00:39:09.264,"Okay, look, there's a hot-ass girl who works right there. There she is, in the bookstore."
00:39:09.347,00:39:10.640,"You should ask her out, man."
00:39:13.434,00:39:15.728,There's something wrong with her underpants.
00:39:15.812,00:39:20.066,"- Cal: Yeah, they're not in my mouth. - You know, I kind of..."
00:39:20.150,00:39:22.277,like the woman from the eBay store.
00:39:22.360,00:39:26.698,"That's great, but you're not gonna get with anyone unless you play the odds on this, man."
00:39:26.781,00:39:28.449,You need to plant a lot of seeds.
00:39:28.533,00:39:34.331,"It's like this, when I was growing pot - I realized that the more... - Thank you."
00:39:34.413,00:39:38.084,...seeds I planted the more pot I could ultimately smoke.
00:39:38.168,00:39:41.629,I think I have all the advice that I can handle right now.
00:39:41.713,00:39:43.422,- Don't get bitter. - I'm not bitter!
00:39:43.506,00:39:45.633,"I almost lost a nipple, okay?"
00:39:45.717,00:39:51.223,"The problem most men have is they just plain, straight-up have no clue how to talk to women."
00:39:51.306,00:39:54.767,"You just ask questions, okay? That's it."
00:39:54.851,00:39:59.438,"Because women do not care about what you have to say at all anyway, you know?"
00:39:59.522,00:40:01.524,And all they want to do is talk about themselves.
00:40:01.607,00:40:03.818,"So you're just gonna let them do that, okay?"
00:40:03.902,00:40:08.614,"So remember: Questions, be cool and be kind of a dick."
00:40:08.698,00:40:11.784,"Here, be David Caruso in Jade."
00:40:11.868,00:40:14.079,"Okay, I know exactly what you're talking about."
00:40:14.162,00:40:15.830,You do? That's good.
00:40:17.540,00:40:19.542,"Cal: Oh, there she is."
00:40:21.669,00:40:23.796,"Go plant that seed, man."
00:40:23.880,00:40:25.965,Plant it with your finger.
00:40:37.602,00:40:39.187,Can I help you?
00:40:41.439,00:40:44.150,"I don't know, can you?"
00:40:44.234,00:40:46.652,Are you looking for something?
00:40:48.029,00:40:50.865,Is there something I should be looking for?
00:40:54.577,00:41:00.583,"well, we have a lot of books, so maybe it depends on what you like."
00:41:03.086,00:41:06.464,What-- what do you like?
00:41:06.547,00:41:12.637,"We have a great, um, section of do-it-yourself."
00:41:12.720,00:41:14.806,Do you like to do-it-yourself?
00:41:17.434,00:41:19.936,"I mean, if the..."
00:41:20.019,00:41:22.855,mood strikes.
00:41:22.939,00:41:25.358,How is the mood striking you now?
00:41:32.240,00:41:34.075,What's your name?
00:41:34.159,00:41:35.660,What's your name?
00:41:35.743,00:41:38.496,"I'm, uh, Beth."
00:41:40.706,00:41:42.834,Andy.
00:41:42.917,00:41:44.794,Andy?
00:41:46.545,00:41:48.465,"Don't tell on me, okay, Andy?"
00:41:48.547,00:41:50.675,I won't.
00:41:50.758,00:41:53.678,Unless you want to be told on...
00:41:53.761,00:41:55.221,Beth.
00:41:58.141,00:42:01.560,"Wow, that totally worked! I literally said nothing and she found me fascinating."
00:42:01.644,00:42:04.522,- I would have thought you were doing that for years. - Should I have asked her out?
00:42:04.605,00:42:08.901,"No, that's the key. You wait for her to grow into a plant and then you fuck the plant."
00:42:12.655,00:42:15.741,Okay. This is easy.
00:42:16.868,00:42:18.828,All right. All right.
00:42:18.911,00:42:20.455,"Hello, Trish. How you doing?"
00:42:23.124,00:42:26.127,"Good joke. Oh, this is a fun conversation."
00:42:26.211,00:42:28.629,Just grow a backbone and call her.
00:42:28.713,00:42:31.424,She asked you to call her. She wants you to call her.
00:42:39.182,00:42:40.975,"Hey, how you doing?"
00:42:41.059,00:42:44.979,"- Um, how you doing? - I'm well."
00:42:45.063,00:42:46.981,Who is this?
00:42:47.065,00:42:49.108,This is James.
00:42:52.111,00:42:56.115,"I was wondering whether you had a few minutes to talk about, uh, laundry detergent."
00:42:56.199,00:42:58.535,"Are you a telemarketer, James?"
00:42:58.617,00:43:01.120,- Yeah. - Are you at the top of a tall building?
00:43:01.204,00:43:03.622,Can you get to a roof quickly? Jump off!
00:43:03.706,00:43:06.709,"I mean, you people are sick. Get a real fucking job why don't you?"
00:43:06.792,00:43:08.503,Go shoot yourself in the fucking head!
00:43:08.586,00:43:10.713,"Hey, why don't you just get a knife and run into it?"
00:43:10.796,00:43:12.590,- Why don't you do that? - Okay.
00:43:12.673,00:43:14.633,"- I'll see you later, James. - Nice to talk to you."
00:43:14.717,00:43:17.011,"Fuck your mother, okay? Bye-bye."
00:43:23.226,00:43:25.478,"Hey man, got a big box of porn for you."
00:43:25.562,00:43:27.105,Oh.
00:43:27.188,00:43:30.233,"- Can I come in? - Uh, yeah yeah."
00:43:33.652,00:43:35.988,"So, um..."
00:43:37.115,00:43:38.533,so what's in the box?
00:43:38.616,00:43:40.577,It's my personal collection of erotica.
00:43:40.659,00:43:42.995,- Oh. - I want to give it to you.
00:43:43.079,00:43:46.999,I think there may be a few tapes in there that just might open up Pandora's box of love.
00:43:47.083,00:43:51.546,"- Oh, okay. - Amy and I, we used to watch Harry Twatter."
00:43:51.629,00:43:54.882,And we'd put it on the television then act it out as it was going on.
00:43:54.966,00:43:57.176,And it was-- it was all right.
00:44:00.179,00:44:02.599,Fucking bitch.
00:44:02.681,00:44:08.813,"Well, you know, this is really gracious and kind generous and everything, but I just don't want a big box of porn in my apartment."
00:44:08.896,00:44:11.065,There's some really great stuff in here.
00:44:11.149,00:44:13.859,"Really great great movies in here, man."
00:44:13.943,00:44:16.195,- Did you ever see School of Rock? - Yeah.
00:44:16.279,00:44:21.700,"Well this is-- it's called School of-- - you know. - Oh, that's nice."
00:44:21.784,00:44:24.036,But it stars Jack Blackcock.
00:44:24.120,00:44:25.788,"Oh, that makes sense."
00:44:25.871,00:44:27.999,"Dude, here it is."
00:44:28.082,00:44:30.376,Boner Jams '03. It's a mix tape I made.
00:44:30.460,00:44:35.548,All these great scenes that I was really into in the summer of 2003. I think you'd really dig it.
00:44:35.632,00:44:37.383,"Yeah, I can see that."
00:44:37.467,00:44:41.638,This is... Everybody Loves Raymond.
00:44:41.720,00:44:44.599,That's probably not supposed-- that's just a good show. I tape it sometimes.
00:44:44.682,00:44:48.102,"I don't think you understand something, Dave. I don't want this stuff, okay?"
00:44:48.186,00:44:51.063,Because I don't do that that much.
00:44:51.147,00:44:53.232,"- What, masturbate? - Yeah."
00:44:53.316,00:44:56.735,"Are you-- dude, I've jacked it twice since I've been here."
00:44:56.819,00:44:59.280,- Are you kidding me? Why not? - It's not a hobby of mine.
00:44:59.364,00:45:01.574,"Well, then that's the only hobby you don't have."
00:45:01.658,00:45:06.412,"Ha-ha-ha. No, seriously, I just don't feel comfortable talking-- You need to. You're wound up."
00:45:06.496,00:45:08.873,"You're like action figures, hermetically sealed in your box."
00:45:08.956,00:45:11.167,- You got to play with-- - Don't! Don't!
00:45:11.250,00:45:13.710,Don't! Don't take it out! I'm sorry.
00:45:13.794,00:45:15.712,You know what? It's just...
00:45:15.796,00:45:18.424,it loses it's value if you take it out of it's packaging.
00:45:18.508,00:45:20.759,"I'm just saying let it out. Give it some air, man."
00:45:20.843,00:45:23.054,- Play with it. - Take your porn with you.
00:45:23.137,00:45:26.098,- I'm not taking it. - Take your box of porn!
00:45:26.182,00:45:29.268,"- That is my gift to you. - No, I don't want it."
00:45:32.021,00:45:34.023,I don't want your giant box of pornography!
00:45:34.106,00:45:37.527,"No no, shh! Come on, man. That is so uncool."
00:45:37.610,00:45:39.612,Uncool?!
00:45:39.696,00:45:44.659,"Uncool is trying to give an honest man a big box of porn, Andy!"
00:45:44.741,00:45:49.163,Dave: For the last time I don't want to watch School of Cock with you.
00:46:58.357,00:47:01.110,It's nothing official.
00:47:01.193,00:47:05.406,Just a little token of my appreciation.
00:47:13.331,00:47:17.042,"Eww! Okay. Okay, new tape."
00:47:19.086,00:47:21.422,Nothing is ever good enough and it's always our fault!
00:47:21.506,00:47:23.299,You can't speak to your mother like that!
00:47:23.382,00:47:25.926,- You do. - She's not my mother!
00:47:32.849,00:47:35.770,"This right here, you're looking at the Bentley of big-screen TVs."
00:47:35.852,00:47:38.939,This is the Rolls-Royce of big-screen-- oh Jeez!
00:47:39.023,00:47:42.234,- Dude. - Sometimes I think these butterflies are in here.
00:47:44.195,00:47:45.946,"Hey, Andy, what are you doing for lunch?"
00:47:46.030,00:47:48.282,"Um, I don't know. I have a turkey sandwich."
00:47:48.366,00:47:51.536,We're gonna go around the corner. I think you should come with us.
00:47:51.619,00:47:54.831,There's this great place. Lot of cute girls.
00:47:54.913,00:47:56.624,I don't know. Okay.
00:47:56.708,00:47:59.669,We brought you a shirt.
00:47:59.752,00:48:02.046,This place is pretty fancy.
00:48:02.129,00:48:04.006,Is something going on?
00:48:07.468,00:48:09.721,"Hey, guys."
00:48:09.804,00:48:13.140,"Hey! No, don't ignore me. I know what this is."
00:48:13.224,00:48:15.768,"Within one hour, you'll each have 20 dates."
00:48:15.852,00:48:17.936,Would you just quit whining like a bitch?
00:48:18.020,00:48:20.314,- I'm not whining like a bitch. - You are.
00:48:20.398,00:48:23.860,"Man, you're about to cram like 10 years of pimpage into one day."
00:48:23.942,00:48:26.654,"- I don't want to cram pimpage. - Partner, after that..."
00:48:26.738,00:48:28.656,you on my level. Come on.
00:48:28.740,00:48:31.325,- Cal: Just ask questions. - This is a bad idea.
00:48:33.910,00:48:35.496,"- Hi. - Hi, how are you?"
00:48:35.580,00:48:37.998,I'm fine.
00:48:38.082,00:48:40.084,Are you fine?
00:48:40.167,00:48:43.003,- Yeah. - You're fine then?
00:48:43.087,00:48:45.381,Are you fucking retarded?
00:48:45.464,00:48:47.466,What the hell's the matter with you?
00:48:49.886,00:48:56.768,"When I look into the eyes of the children and the parents and they're smiling and saying Thank you, Dr. Montalban, you saved my child."
00:49:00.605,00:49:02.231,Amy.
00:49:02.314,00:49:04.525,- What are you doing here? - David.
00:49:05.942,00:49:07.445,And you are Gina?
00:49:07.528,00:49:09.530,"Jy-na. Man, what's up?"
00:49:09.614,00:49:12.241,"- Nothing. - Look, I'm gonna be real honest with you."
00:49:12.324,00:49:15.202,It's been a long time since I've been with a man.
00:49:15.286,00:49:18.205,Spent a lot of time with the ladies.
00:49:18.289,00:49:20.750,Looking to get back up on that pogo stick.
00:49:20.833,00:49:22.835,- You know what I'm saying? - Excuse me?
00:49:22.919,00:49:26.547,Remember that time when we made love and you cried in my arms?
00:49:26.631,00:49:29.300,Please don't reminisce about the times we fucked. Please!
00:49:29.383,00:49:31.469,- It's so creepy. - Let's go to Paris.
00:49:31.552,00:49:33.638,I want to take you underneath the Eiffel Tower and make love to you.
00:49:33.721,00:49:35.681,- Cut it out! - Cut what out?
00:49:35.765,00:49:38.183,"This. Go to Paris. We've been broken up for two years, man."
00:49:38.267,00:49:40.352,- I don't want to date you anymore. - You're a whore.
00:49:40.436,00:49:42.730,I am not a whore. I just didn't like you.
00:49:45.566,00:49:48.026,- Psycho talk. - What?!
00:49:48.110,00:49:50.028,- You're a good-looking man. - Thank you.
00:49:50.112,00:49:52.239,Very pretty. Real soft delicate features.
00:49:52.323,00:49:58.871,"They're real feminine, which is good for me, because that would be a simple sort of transition, you know what I'm saying?"
00:49:58.955,00:50:02.875,"Maybe throw a little rouge on you, tuck your sack back. You game?"
00:50:04.794,00:50:08.714,"You need to stop fucking around with my friend, okay?"
00:50:08.798,00:50:11.634,Because you're giving him hope and it's driving the man crazy.
00:50:11.717,00:50:14.762,"I moved, I changed my email address, my phone number."
00:50:14.846,00:50:21.310,"- He's practically stalking me. - Well, I didn't know all that, Oh, I love Minnesota."
00:50:21.393,00:50:29.401,"Woman: I grew up in a town outside of Minneapolis - Really small. - Yeah, it's like the land of a thousand lakes."
00:50:29.485,00:50:32.112,What about you? You're used to a really big city.
00:50:32.196,00:50:34.782,"Really-- God, yes."
00:50:34.866,00:50:41.455,"The town that I grew up in was really small. I mean, - it was just so safe. There was no crime. - Boob. Come on."
00:50:41.539,00:50:46.794,"I mean, a girl could just walk from one end of town to the other - and just, you know... - Mmm."
00:50:55.302,00:50:57.471,I'll tell you who was the hottest.
00:50:57.555,00:51:00.140,"You're going to think I'm crazy, but I'm going to tell you."
00:51:00.224,00:51:03.019,"Gina, man. I can't get Gina out of my head."
00:51:03.101,00:51:15.364,- Gonna think of Gina all week. - I think that-- - You know what's a fun game? - Huh?
00:51:15.447,00:51:19.827,You take three Excedrin P.M.s and you see if you can whack off before you fall asleep.
00:51:22.120,00:51:24.665,You always win is the best part about the game.
00:51:27.459,00:51:29.461,- Are you Andy? - Yeah.
00:51:29.545,00:51:31.047,Is this yours? Did you write this stuff?
00:51:31.129,00:51:33.507,My girlfriend Jill found your speed dating card.
00:51:33.591,00:51:35.259,"Oh, yeah, right."
00:51:35.342,00:51:37.428,"God, I've been looking for that speed dating card."
00:51:37.511,00:51:39.847,Thank you so much for bringing it to me.
00:51:39.931,00:51:43.392,So you actually wrote that one girl looked like she was hurting for a squirting?
00:51:43.475,00:51:46.896,"Mm-hmm. Yeah, hurting for a squirting. I wrote that."
00:51:46.979,00:51:50.399,"Oh, so you wrote, Ho for sho?"
00:51:50.482,00:51:53.027,"Yeah, I remember that girl. She was a ho..."
00:51:53.109,00:51:54.695,for sho.
00:51:54.779,00:51:56.697,Let me show you how this device works.
00:51:56.781,00:51:59.491,"- I'm just looking for a cordless phone. - Yep, it's great."
00:51:59.575,00:52:01.493,You can do anything-- make a video diary.
00:52:01.577,00:52:03.495,"It's like, Hey, Amy, how's it going?"
00:52:03.579,00:52:05.456,How you feeling? I'm great!
00:52:05.539,00:52:08.166,I feel fantastic since we broke up.
00:52:10.461,00:52:13.464,Can you just show me the department where there would be phones?
00:52:13.547,00:52:15.466,How have you been? What's been going on?
00:52:15.549,00:52:17.718,"I bet-- hey, have you been doing a lot of this?"
00:52:20.930,00:52:27.352,"You are never going to meet anybody with that kind of mentality about women, - you sick son of a bitch! - Who the fuck are you to put me on trial?"
00:52:27.436,00:52:33.233,I've never even met you. So why don't you back the shit off and stop with the inquisition?
00:52:33.317,00:52:35.027,- That's how you talk? - You know what?
00:52:35.111,00:52:37.321,I don't have to answer to you. You ain't my bitch.
00:52:39.406,00:52:42.076,"So shit, man. Fuck it."
00:52:42.158,00:52:44.036,You shouldn't even be hanging out with this pervert.
00:52:44.120,00:52:46.288,I don't hang out with him. I work with him and that's it.
00:52:46.371,00:52:49.083,"I tried to introduce him to a few nice people, he made a fool of himself."
00:52:49.165,00:52:50.835,I don't mess with him. That's not me.
00:52:50.918,00:52:52.920,You should keep your ho on a leash.
00:52:53.004,00:52:55.589,"- Hold, bro, I can't let you-- - Hey hey hey."
00:52:55.673,00:52:59.259,"- I can't let you be talking to my woman like that, dawg. - Hey, bitch is running wild."
00:52:59.343,00:53:02.262,You miss that ass? That's the ass of a free man.
00:53:02.346,00:53:06.600,"That ass is going out tonight, maybe to a club, maybe to a nightclub."
00:53:06.684,00:53:08.811,"- Hey, Andy! - David: I'll give it to her for free!"
00:53:08.894,00:53:10.813,- Take a look at your pal. - Oh my God.
00:53:10.896,00:53:13.440,"- Yeah, he's performing a public colonoscopy. - Shit."
00:53:13.524,00:53:18.988,"Isn't that sweet? I'm going to send David home for the day, - and you're going to fill in for him. - What? Selling things?"
00:53:19.071,00:53:21.197,- You got that right. - I don't think that's a good idea.
00:53:21.281,00:53:25.786,"You're going to have to talk to people, and I know that's a frightening concept, but I think you can handle it."
00:53:25.870,00:53:27.371,So get out there and start selling.
00:53:27.454,00:53:29.205,"- I was making a thing for Amy! - Stop, man."
00:53:29.289,00:53:31.792,- Pull these-- ugh. - Check it out. I miss her.
00:53:34.503,00:53:36.588,"Dude, the floor's the ultimate aphrodisiac."
00:53:36.672,00:53:39.591,"All you got to do is go make your pick now. Come on, man."
00:53:41.969,00:53:46.598,- And you could act a little enthused about it. - Yeah.
00:53:46.682,00:53:50.811,"Jay: That's right, that's right. Gazelle in the pink top."
00:53:50.895,00:53:55.315,"- Oh shit. - Oh, hey. It looks like - you're checking out digital cameras. - You know what?"
00:53:55.399,00:53:56.859,He ain't going to do it willingly.
00:53:56.942,00:53:59.444,Now we need to facilitate things a bit more.
00:53:59.528,00:54:01.279,"- Yo, Andy. - Yeah."
00:54:01.363,00:54:04.116,"- Hey, what's up, dude? This is Jay, man. - Oh hey, Jay."
00:54:04.200,00:54:07.786,"I am throwing a party tonight. It's going to be real mellow, just chilled out."
00:54:07.870,00:54:11.247,Now you really need to be there. It's going to be really really colorful.
00:54:11.331,00:54:14.710,- Are you free? - I think so.
00:54:14.793,00:54:16.712,"That was a joke, man. I know you're free."
00:54:18.422,00:54:20.465,"- Got to go, man. - All right, bye."
00:54:22.718,00:54:24.762,"So tell me, Montel."
00:54:24.845,00:54:28.182,"Why weren't we invited to the party? What are we, Al Qaeda?"
00:54:28.264,00:54:31.518,"- No, hold up. It's not that kind of party! - No no no!"
00:54:31.602,00:54:34.855,"You're not coming to our fucking party either, okay? Fuck you!"
00:54:34.939,00:54:37.108,"- Yeah. - First of all, it ain't that kind of party."
00:54:37.191,00:54:39.317,- Go fuck a goat! - Yeah!
00:54:39.401,00:54:42.196,"- Why are you always telling me to fuck a goat, man?! - Mooj: Fuck a goat!"
00:54:58.670,00:54:59.755,Hello?
00:55:02.174,00:55:03.759,Hello?
00:55:08.806,00:55:11.892,Hi. Are you here for Jay's party?
00:55:11.976,00:55:14.979,Yes. I am Jay's party.
00:55:17.106,00:55:20.025,"Hiring a transvestite prostitute isn't helping me, man!"
00:55:20.109,00:55:22.569,What? Ain't nobody hiring no damn transvestite!
00:55:22.653,00:55:25.239,"She was really nice, incidentally."
00:55:25.321,00:55:29.076,"If that sister was a transvestite, that was the Mona Lisa of transvestites."
00:55:29.160,00:55:31.245,"You got a hummer from the tranny, didn't you?"
00:55:31.327,00:55:34.456,Aren't we owed one now? 'Cause technically we paid her.
00:55:34.539,00:55:41.379,"- She had a dick, man! - Do you guys even like me, or is this some sort of cruel joke that you're all in on?"
00:55:41.463,00:55:43.423,Because I'm not a freak! I'm a good person.
00:55:43.507,00:55:50.139,"I always thought that Matt Damon was a Streisand, but I think that he's rocking the shit in this one."
00:55:51.598,00:55:53.558,Hold up! Hold up!
00:55:53.642,00:55:55.769,Let's just chill on the aggression for a minute.
00:55:57.521,00:56:00.649,He is such a bad-ass.
00:56:00.732,00:56:04.320,- He looks just like Luke Wilson. - Mm-hmm.
00:56:04.402,00:56:07.114,- So you're saying she was definitely a man? - Yes.
00:56:07.198,00:56:08.949,How do you know that she was a man?
00:56:09.033,00:56:15.455,Because her hands were as big as Andre the Giant's and she had an Adam's apple as big as her balls.
00:56:15.539,00:56:17.958,So you have no proof?
00:56:18.042,00:56:19.960,You know what? Just leave me alone.
00:56:20.044,00:56:24.131,Just stay away from me or I'm going to tell Paula that you're all stealing the recordable CDs.
00:56:24.215,00:56:26.717,"- Whoa! Come on! - Whoa whoa whoa! Come on, man."
00:56:26.800,00:56:31.347,"We did this 'cause we're you're friends, and we didn't think you had the balls to do it yourself."
00:56:31.429,00:56:33.015,- Oh really? - Dave: Yeah.
00:56:33.098,00:56:34.766,"Okay, watch this."
00:56:34.850,00:56:36.768,"Yo, Andy! It's just CDs, man!"
00:56:36.852,00:56:38.979,"That's a third strike for me, dawg!"
00:57:02.418,00:57:04.171,Hi.
00:57:04.255,00:57:07.132,"- Andy, hi. - Right. Yep. You remember my name."
00:57:07.216,00:57:10.677,- I did. How you doing? - I'm great. I like your store.
00:57:10.761,00:57:16.058,"That's good. If you have time, look around, it's-- Okay. How's business been?"
00:57:16.141,00:57:18.352,"You know, it's coming along."
00:57:18.435,00:57:21.146,- It takes a while. - Do you want to go out sometime?
00:57:21.230,00:57:24.191,"Yes. Yes, I would like that."
00:57:24.275,00:57:32.366,"- Okay. - That'd be great. I think I'm maybe free this weekend if you, um-- if that's okay. Or you could call me tomorrow - and we can just firm it up. - Okay."
00:57:32.449,00:57:37.037,"- Both: Great. - Okay, so I'll call you and yeah, that'll be good. That'll be good."
00:57:37.121,00:57:38.872,- How you doing? - Congratulations.
00:57:38.956,00:57:41.250,"Okay, so I'll-- yeah."
00:57:41.333,00:57:44.169,"- Can I help you? - Uh, yeah, these are wonderful."
00:57:44.253,00:57:46.755,"- I'll take these. - Thanks, they are."
00:57:46.838,00:57:48.882,They're great and the goldfish just crack me up.
00:57:50.592,00:57:52.219,"Yeah, they are. They're cute."
00:57:52.303,00:57:54.263,I actually don't sell anything here.
00:57:54.346,00:57:55.722,I just sell them on eBay.
00:57:55.806,00:57:57.599,"Oh, I don't get it."
00:57:57.682,00:57:59.310,- I know. - Okay.
00:57:59.393,00:58:02.020,"- Can you help me? - No, you're on your own here."
00:58:02.104,00:58:04.440,Good luck to you and to you.
00:58:04.522,00:58:06.150,- I'll give you a call. - Great.
00:58:06.233,00:58:08.902,- Great. Nice to see you. - Thanks for coming in.
00:58:10.988,00:58:14.741,"So, I guess I'll give you some money and you can give me these shoes."
00:58:14.825,00:58:17.911,"You know, I know it seems so strange."
00:58:17.995,00:58:20.664,"Yeah, so I'd just rather buy them from you, straight up."
00:58:20.747,00:58:26.128,"Yeah, I know. I wish it could be that easy, but-- I wish too, but you're making it extremely difficult for me."
00:58:26.211,00:58:29.547,I'm just trying to get these shoes back to my house so I can wear them.
00:58:29.631,00:58:32.801,- David: I got a corpse in my way. - Cal: Just kill it.
00:58:32.884,00:58:37.473,"That's so not fair that you have blades in your-- - Ha! - I'm telling you, man. I feel great."
00:58:37.555,00:58:40.142,I'm so-- it's like a weight has been lifted.
00:58:40.225,00:58:42.894,"Celibacy is the way to go, man. Andy had it right."
00:58:42.978,00:58:49.318,"Look at him. He looks younger than all of us, but he's 10 years older. Why? It's because he's never had a relationship."
00:58:49.401,00:58:52.570,No she-devil sucked his life force out yet.
00:59:08.295,00:59:11.173,"- Hello? - Hey hey, hi, hello."
00:59:11.256,00:59:14.343,"- Um, is this Trish? - Who's calling, please?"
00:59:14.426,00:59:17.137,"- This is Andy. - Oh, hi, Andy!"
00:59:17.221,00:59:19.431,"- Hi, how are you doing? - I'm good, how are you doing?"
00:59:19.515,00:59:21.016,"I'm doing great, I'm doing great."
00:59:21.099,00:59:25.603,"- So you're gay now? - No, I'm not gay, I'm just celibate."
00:59:25.687,00:59:34.029,I think-- I mean that sounds g-- I just want you to know that this is the first conversation of three conversations that leads to you being gay.
00:59:34.112,00:59:40.785,"There's this, and then in a year it's like, Oh, you know, I kinda want to get back out there, but I think I like guys."
00:59:40.869,00:59:43.372,"And then there's the big, Oh, I'm a gay guy now."
00:59:43.455,00:59:46.375,- You're gay for saying that. - I'm gay for saying that?
00:59:46.458,00:59:48.835,- You know how I know you're gay? - How do you know I'm gay?
00:59:48.919,00:59:51.588,'Cause you macraméd yourself a pair of jean shorts.
00:59:51.671,00:59:54.591,Know how I know you're gay? You just told me you're not sleeping with women anymore.
00:59:54.674,00:59:59.513,"- You know how I know you're gay? - How, 'cause you're gay and you can tell who other gay people are?"
00:59:59.596,01:00:01.473,- You know how I know you're gay? - How?
01:00:01.557,01:00:03.600,You like Coldplay.
01:00:03.683,01:00:07.271,"- Oh, you're dead. You're dead. Oh! - Oh! Come on."
01:00:07.354,01:00:09.273,Leave my torso alone at least.
01:00:09.356,01:00:14.111,I also wanted to call and-- and see what night you might want to go out.
01:00:14.194,01:00:16.780,I'm actually free tonight.
01:00:16.863,01:00:18.782,"Well, oh-- okay."
01:00:18.865,01:00:21.326,"Well, I was thinking maybe this weekend, but that's good."
01:00:21.410,01:00:24.746,"- Okay. - Oh, great. What time do you want to pick me up?"
01:00:24.829,01:00:26.623,Uh...
01:00:26.706,01:00:32.588,"let's see. That's actually kind of a problem, because I ride a bike."
01:00:32.670,01:00:34.756,"That's cool, are you kidding me?"
01:00:34.839,01:00:39.803,I love getting on the back of a motorcycle. My boyfriend in college - drove a motorcycle so... - Yeah. Yeah.
01:00:39.886,01:00:41.930,"- ...I'm cool. - Yeah, I bet that was cool."
01:00:42.013,01:00:45.350,- I ride a bike-- bikes-- bike-cycle-- bicycle. - Oh.
01:00:45.434,01:00:47.769,You know how I know that you're gay?
01:00:47.852,01:00:50.397,- How? - You like the movie Maid in Manhattan.
01:00:50.481,01:00:52.690,- You know how I know you're gay? - How?
01:00:52.774,01:00:55.277,I saw you make spinach dip in a loaf of sourdough bread once.
01:00:55.360,01:00:57.654,- You know I know that you're gay? - How?
01:00:57.737,01:01:03.494,You have a rainbow bumper sticker on your car - that says I love it when balls are in my face. - That's gay?
01:01:03.577,01:01:06.830,- God damn it! - I'm ripping your head off right now.
01:01:06.913,01:01:10.959,"It's off, and now I'm throwing it at your body."
01:01:14.338,01:01:16.131,You guys...
01:01:16.214,01:01:18.133,she's picking me up in an hour.
01:01:19.259,01:01:21.261,"Oh, drag, dude."
01:01:21.345,01:01:22.804,"Wait, she's-- picking you up from here?"
01:01:22.887,01:01:24.806,"- Yeah. - That's fucked up, man."
01:01:24.889,01:01:28.435,- Why? - Why?! Seriously!
01:01:29.645,01:01:31.605,"I mean, look at this place, man."
01:01:31.688,01:01:34.732,You-- you gotta see this through the eyes of a woman.
01:01:34.816,01:01:37.569,What is she gonna think when she comes in here?
01:01:37.653,01:01:39.571,"- Look, he's got a billion toys. - So what?"
01:01:39.655,01:01:42.032,And more video games than a teenaged Asian kid.
01:01:42.115,01:01:44.117,"Well, s-- all right."
01:01:44.201,01:01:47.871,Is that the Six Million Dollar Man's boss?
01:01:47.954,01:01:49.914,- It's Oscar Goldman. - Why do you have that?
01:01:49.998,01:01:52.250,That's worth a lot of money.
01:01:52.334,01:01:57.755,"- That's much more valuable than Steve Austin. - That may be the case, but none of this shit is sexy, okay?"
01:01:57.839,01:01:59.383,"I'm not trying to be sexy, man!"
01:01:59.466,01:02:03.094,I mean-- Asia? You framed an Asia poster?
01:02:03.178,01:02:06.181,How hard did the people at the frame store laugh when you brought this in?
01:02:06.264,01:02:09.767,- They did not laugh at me! - Know why you're gay? 'Cause you like Asia.
01:02:09.851,01:02:12.312,"Cool it with the gay! She's on her way over here, okay?"
01:02:12.396,01:02:14.981,"First you relax, okay?"
01:02:15.065,01:02:17.901,Just stop calming me down and tell me what I should do.
01:02:17.984,01:02:23.699,"We take everything that's embarrassing, and we move it out of here so it doesn't look like you live in Neverland Ranch."
01:02:29.413,01:02:31.789,"- Hi. - Hi, how are you?"
01:02:31.873,01:02:34.876,"- Good. - So, you want to head out?"
01:02:34.959,01:02:36.753,Did you just move in or something?
01:02:36.836,01:02:40.924,"Oh, no. No, actually, I'm getting new carpet in-- I'm having carpet put in tomorrow."
01:02:41.007,01:02:43.051,- Oh. - So...
01:02:43.134,01:02:45.303,"- Oh, well. - Yep, okay."
01:02:45.387,01:02:48.223,- It looks good with the floors. All right. - Yeah.
01:02:48.306,01:02:51.976,I should tear up the hardwood and see if there's carpet underneath.
01:02:58.816,01:03:02.195,"- Yes, this is. - I drive by this place every day, I've never been in."
01:03:02.279,01:03:04.948,I'm glad you came.
01:03:05.031,01:03:08.201,I never really go out with nice guys like you.
01:03:08.285,01:03:16.585,I think I've avoided nice guys like you my whole life My last boyfriend drank a lot.
01:03:16.668,01:03:20.338,- Mm-hmm. - And so-- This is just punch.
01:03:20.422,01:03:22.758,"- It's okay, a little bit's fine. - Buddha punch."
01:03:22.840,01:03:24.760,I need some Buddha.
01:03:26.928,01:03:30.181,Could you gather your team and sing Happy Birthday for my daughter please?
01:03:45.196,01:03:46.406,Yay!
01:03:48.700,01:03:51.745,"- That was so good. What? - That was great, happy birthday."
01:03:51.828,01:03:53.871,"- It's your birthday, too? - No."
01:03:53.955,01:03:56.082,"- Hey, it's his birthday too! - No no no."
01:03:56.166,01:03:58.376,Could you sing for him and bring him a cake?
01:03:58.460,01:04:00.462,Man: Happy birthday!
01:04:10.806,01:04:14.058,- Thank you. Thank you. - Happy birthday!
01:04:14.142,01:04:16.102,"- Thanks a lot. - Happy birthday, Andy."
01:04:25.445,01:04:27.447,Wow.
01:04:29.533,01:04:35.622,"You-- You really like kissing, don't you?"
01:04:38.542,01:04:41.419,"- I really do-- what? - Take off your-- take off your pants, okay?"
01:04:41.503,01:04:43.963,"Oh, okay."
01:04:44.047,01:04:45.006,Okay?
01:04:47.592,01:04:49.720,"- Wow, this is really gonna happen. - Oh, yeah."
01:04:49.803,01:04:52.514,Thank God.
01:04:52.597,01:04:55.225,Okay. I'm taking off my pants.
01:04:55.308,01:04:57.935,Yeah. Do you need some help?
01:04:58.019,01:05:01.981,I think almost got 'em. It's hooked on my ankle.
01:05:04.317,01:05:06.528,"Hey, wait, do you have protection?"
01:05:06.611,01:05:08.530,I don't like guns.
01:05:11.867,01:05:13.702,- That's-- funny. - Thanks.
01:05:13.785,01:05:15.704,"I have condoms right here, okay?"
01:05:15.787,01:05:20.876,"- Okay. - There's, you know-- check the expiration date because they were from when I was married."
01:05:20.958,01:05:23.754,"We didn't have sex that often, that's why there are so many, okay?"
01:05:23.837,01:05:25.630,Okay.
01:05:29.300,01:05:31.177,"Oh, got 'em."
01:05:34.305,01:05:36.224,Okay.
01:05:36.307,01:05:39.686,Roll over the tip and down onto the base.
01:05:41.145,01:05:44.733,Over the balls? It doesn't say.
01:05:48.152,01:05:50.154,Do you mind if I use your-- Magnum?
01:05:53.700,01:05:55.577,Ho-ho-- wow.
01:05:55.660,01:05:57.621,You gotta be kidding.
01:05:57.704,01:05:59.790,I am Aquaman.
01:06:01.416,01:06:03.418,What is that?
01:06:20.268,01:06:22.979,Mom? Whoa!
01:06:23.062,01:06:24.940,What's going on here? Who the hell are you?
01:06:25.022,01:06:27.150,"- It's Andy! - Hi, I'm Andy."
01:06:27.233,01:06:31.112,"- God! What are you doing?! - Marla, get the fuck out of my room!"
01:06:31.195,01:06:37.285,- Andy: You know what-- - I cannot believe - you're allowed to have sex but I'm not! That is so unfair! - I'm gonna head out.
01:06:37.368,01:06:40.538,"- Trish: You should go. - Oh, Jesus, how many times did you just do it?!"
01:06:40.622,01:06:42.666,- Oh my God.
01:06:43.959,01:06:46.461,I'm so sorry.
01:06:49.631,01:06:51.048,God.
01:06:52.884,01:06:54.970,Dude... teach me.
01:07:11.987,01:07:14.030,Oh!
01:07:14.113,01:07:30.046,"Ah, sh-- Oof! My goodness, Andy, you are a terrific salesman."
01:07:30.129,01:07:32.799,"- Oh, thank you. - Gosh, you really got it down."
01:07:32.883,01:07:34.843,"- Thanks. - Yeah, your numbers are good."
01:07:34.926,01:07:37.220,- Thanks. - I'm gonna put you out on the floor full-time.
01:07:37.303,01:07:39.430,- Really? - Yeah.
01:07:39.514,01:07:42.017,"- Wow, okay. - Good, we're gonna get you a blue shirt and the tie."
01:07:42.099,01:07:45.812,"- Great, thanks. - You know, Andy, I've been thinking about your problem."
01:07:45.896,01:07:47.772,I think I might have a solution for you.
01:07:47.856,01:07:51.192,- Hmm. - You ever heard of the term...
01:07:51.275,01:07:53.987,fuck buddy?
01:07:54.070,01:07:55.864,S-- wha--?
01:07:55.947,01:08:00.368,It's a special friend who you fuck.
01:08:00.451,01:08:02.913,"No, I haven't heard that term."
01:08:02.996,01:08:07.042,"When I was a little girl, I developed early."
01:08:07.124,01:08:10.211,"By the time I was 14, I had this body you're looking at."
01:08:10.294,01:08:13.423,"- Can you imagine that? - I don't want to, no."
01:08:13.506,01:08:16.551,"Well, needless to say, a lot of male attention."
01:08:16.634,01:08:18.720,"I bet, yes."
01:08:18.803,01:08:22.223,"Especially from our Guatemalan gardener, Javier."
01:08:22.306,01:08:25.602,"- Okay. - You know, Javier..."
01:08:25.685,01:08:36.654,before he made passionate yet gentle he serenaded me with a beautiful old Guatemalan love song.
01:08:36.738,01:08:41.325,Really? That's-- that's-- sounds nice.
01:09:07.727,01:09:09.228,Okay.
01:09:11.272,01:09:14.442,Ooh! My goodness. I think we better get back to work.
01:09:14.525,01:09:16.111,Yeah-- yeah. I better go back to work.
01:09:16.193,01:09:18.655,"- Yeah. - So, okay."
01:09:18.738,01:09:21.908,"- All right. You mull it over and I'll talk to you soon. - All right, I will."
01:09:21.992,01:09:29.540,"- Okay. - Woman over P.A.: Please come to the in-dash - Hey. - What's up, dawg? What happened?"
01:09:29.624,01:09:31.417,How was the date with Trish?
01:09:31.501,01:09:33.628,- It was a disaster. - Really?
01:09:33.711,01:09:36.547,"Yes, I've never been more embarrassed in my life."
01:09:36.631,01:09:44.139,"I couldn't get the condoms to work, one of them exploded on my balls and then her kid walked in the room."
01:09:44.221,01:09:46.933,"- Wait, hold up. She was hiding the kid from you, dawg? - You know what?"
01:09:47.017,01:09:49.811,"It doesn't matter, because it was going downhill straight from there."
01:09:49.894,01:09:51.813,"Listen, you don't want no baby-daddy drama."
01:09:51.896,01:09:53.523,"Trust me on this one, a'ight?"
01:09:53.606,01:09:55.733,"For all you know, he in prison right now."
01:09:55.817,01:10:01.489,"Let's say y'all living together, next thing you know, you the one going on the 1st and the 15th to pick up the government check."
01:10:01.572,01:10:04.325,What if he got boys that's on the outside and they stalking you?
01:10:04.408,01:10:08.371,"You see what I'm saying? You got to think, partner-- What the fuck are you talking about?"
01:10:08.454,01:10:10.999,Here's what you do. You tell her you're a virgin.
01:10:11.082,01:10:13.250,"You test her with this shit, okay?"
01:10:13.334,01:10:15.837,"Tell me, this is how it's gonna go. Tell me."
01:10:15.920,01:10:18.506,- I'm a virgin. - Sweet!
01:10:18.589,01:10:23.260,I like that because you don't have Chlamydia.
01:10:23.344,01:10:26.014,And I know that. And that shit is everywhere.
01:10:26.097,01:10:28.224,"What if she laughs at me, though?"
01:10:28.307,01:10:30.518,Then you punch her in the fucking head if she laughs.
01:10:30.601,01:10:33.063,"I'm not gonna punch her in the head, she's really sweet."
01:10:33.146,01:10:36.691,"No, I mean, you punch her in the head emotionally."
01:10:36.774,01:10:41.029,"She's different, she's someone I felt like I had a connection with."
01:10:41.112,01:10:44.782,All you trying to do right now is bust off this first nut.
01:10:44.866,01:10:48.452,- You got a whole lot of semen back up in you. - I am going to tell her.
01:10:48.536,01:10:50.747,- You should totally tell her. - I'm going to.
01:10:50.830,01:10:55.418,"'Cause I watched this movie called Liar, Liar, and the message was Don't lie."
01:10:55.501,01:10:58.629,"- And that was a smart movie. - Yeah, that's the right thing."
01:10:58.713,01:11:00.464,Really?
01:11:00.548,01:11:04.177,All your girlfriends wanted to have sex with virgins too?
01:11:04.260,01:11:07.889,"That's funny, I didn't even know you-- girls talked like that."
01:11:07.972,01:11:11.893,"I think my first time might be your best time, too."
01:11:11.976,01:11:13.728,"Well, I knew it. You know what?"
01:11:13.811,01:11:28.243,I knew that you'd react that way and I knew that you would want to lead me through my first sexual encounter with all the compassion and care that someone would give to their soulmate.
01:11:28.325,01:11:29.953,"Oh my God, I am in trouble."
01:11:32.997,01:11:34.999,"Hey, Andy!"
01:11:35.083,01:11:37.085,"- You watching Survivor tonight? - Oh, no."
01:11:37.168,01:11:39.129,"- Actually, I'm going out to dinner with somebody. - Oh."
01:11:39.212,01:11:41.631,"- Hi. - Oh, and this is her."
01:11:41.714,01:11:44.092,"- Um, Trish, this is Joe and Sara. - Hi."
01:11:44.175,01:11:45.760,"- Hi, Trish. - Hey."
01:11:45.843,01:11:47.553,"- Tape it for me, okay? - Will do."
01:11:47.637,01:11:49.513,"- Thanks, all right. - So long."
01:11:49.597,01:11:51.474,- See you later. Have a good night. - Sara: Bye-bye.
01:11:51.557,01:11:54.269,"Yeah, my man's gonna get it on tonight! Yes, sir!"
01:11:54.351,01:11:58.064,"Mm-hmm, and you better get on me, too. Mm-hmm."
01:11:58.148,01:12:01.276,What is wrong with this woman? Mercy mercy mercy.
01:12:05.571,01:12:07.698,Thanks.
01:12:07.782,01:12:10.160,"- I'm so sorry that happened the other night. - No, I'm sorry."
01:12:10.243,01:12:12.120,- Oh my God. - I'm sorry. That was me.
01:12:14.205,01:12:16.833,Let me-- I have something I wanna tell you.
01:12:16.916,01:12:18.960,Kinda hard to talk about.
01:12:20.753,01:12:31.681,"But there-- you know, there's certain-- certain things about who I am that, um-- I'm sorry, I have to-- I just have to get this off my chest."
01:12:31.764,01:12:34.350,I am so sorry I didn't tell you I had kids.
01:12:34.433,01:12:36.352,"Yeah, what was that about?"
01:12:36.435,01:12:39.230,"Gosh, you know, that really surprised me."
01:12:42.275,01:12:44.443,"- Sorry. - No. You should have told me, probably..."
01:12:44.527,01:12:47.655,- I know! - ...but what do I care if you have a kid?
01:12:47.738,01:12:49.448,"Well, I have two kids."
01:12:49.532,01:12:51.659,"Uh, wow! Okay."
01:12:51.742,01:12:54.287,"- How old are they? - Uh, six..."
01:12:55.454,01:12:56.831,16.
01:12:56.914,01:12:59.209,21.
01:13:01.460,01:13:03.713,56-- How many kids do you have?
01:13:03.796,01:13:05.422,"- I have three. - Okay, three."
01:13:05.506,01:13:07.884,"- Yeah. Oh, and one of them has a kid. - Oh."
01:13:07.967,01:13:10.427,- A one-year-old. - That's cool That's great.
01:13:12.013,01:13:14.640,I'm really glad we're doing this.
01:13:15.808,01:13:17.060,Me too.
01:13:17.143,01:13:19.103,Um...
01:13:20.771,01:13:32.242,"Listen, Andy, I don't want to send you running for the hills or anything, but I really feel like if we decide to do this again then, um..."
01:13:32.325,01:13:36.204,maybe we should hold off on the physical part for a while.
01:13:38.039,01:13:40.333,That is a fantastic idea.
01:13:40.416,01:13:42.210,Why didn't I think of that?
01:13:42.293,01:13:43.961,- Really? - Totally.
01:13:44.045,01:13:45.629,- No sex? - No!
01:13:45.713,01:13:56.182,"Why do that?! Because-- here's the thing-- from personal experience I found that sex can really complicate things, and what we should be doing right now is just getting to know each other."
01:13:57.892,01:13:59.810,I never thought you'd go for it.
01:13:59.894,01:14:01.187,I'm going for it.
01:14:01.271,01:14:04.190,That just is a great great notion.
01:14:06.150,01:14:08.903,Look at my face. Look at how serious I am.
01:14:08.986,01:14:10.780,Can you see my nostrils?
01:14:14.825,01:14:28.047,"Yeah. You know what? Most guys would be saying Yeah, right now, but, like, by the third date it'd be, Hey, baby, I really need to physically express Well, hey, baby, you know, three dates?"
01:14:28.131,01:14:29.966,Make it 10. 10 dates.
01:14:31.050,01:14:32.676,How about 15?
01:14:34.762,01:14:37.098,Screw your 15! 20 dates!
01:14:37.181,01:14:39.475,"- Okay, 20 dates. - 20 dates."
01:14:39.558,01:14:41.769,- Okay. - This is genius.
01:14:45.856,01:14:48.276,Not as much as you think.
01:14:51.528,01:14:54.031,"Yeah. This is one, right?"
01:14:54.115,01:14:56.200,"Uh-huh-- no, next one."
01:15:00.204,01:15:03.458,"Ahem. Is it safe to come in, or are you guys doing it?"
01:15:03.540,01:15:06.043,"- Honey, it's safe. - Ahem."
01:15:06.127,01:15:07.837,Great.
01:15:11.215,01:15:13.176,"- You remember Marla. - Hi, we met."
01:15:13.259,01:15:16.137,And this is my little bunny rabbit Julia.
01:15:16.220,01:15:17.638,- Hey. - This is Andy.
01:15:17.721,01:15:20.975,"Julia, how're you doing? You know what?"
01:15:21.058,01:15:24.187,Do you by any chance like magic?
01:15:24.270,01:15:26.772,- Yeah. - I thought that you might...
01:15:28.649,01:15:30.818,that you had something shiny behind your ear.
01:15:30.901,01:15:33.321,"Marla, did you see that? Something behind her ear?"
01:15:33.404,01:15:34.822,I think you do. Can I check?
01:15:34.905,01:15:36.657,Do you mind if I check behind your ear?
01:15:40.661,01:15:42.955,"- That's amazing! - Wow, it is amazing!"
01:15:43.039,01:15:45.291,"There's something else, too, behind your ear, I think."
01:15:45.375,01:15:47.584,"No, actually it's not behind your ear. It is your ear."
01:15:52.589,01:15:54.258,I ripped it off.
01:15:56.093,01:16:01.640,"All right, wait, okay, but that means that you walk around with a rubber ear in your pocket all day?"
01:16:01.724,01:16:04.185,"Um, yeah, like, half the time."
01:16:04.268,01:16:08.481,"You know, I can come to your high school and do it for your friends if you want."
01:16:08.564,01:16:10.566,You know what? I should head out.
01:16:10.649,01:16:11.901,- Oh really? - Yeah.
01:16:11.984,01:16:13.736,"Oh, well, I have to give you a ride home."
01:16:13.819,01:16:16.322,"- Right, yes, you do. - Right."
01:16:16.406,01:16:19.116,"- Yeah, 'cause you don't have a car, right? - Right, I don't have a car."
01:16:19.200,01:16:22.328,"That's good, 'cause he doesn't have a car and he does magic."

01:20:12.767,01:20:14.644,I don't know what I was thinking!
01:20:14.727,01:20:16.186,Why did you cheat on her?

01:22:12.928,01:22:15.055,"Oh my God, that is-- so why don't you do that?!"
01:22:15.138,01:22:16.766,I don't have enough money to do that.
01:22:16.849,01:22:20.770,"What about those collectibles? I bet if you sold those, you could make a lot of money."
01:22:20.853,01:22:24.565,"I just sold a guy's G.I. Joe for 1,000 bucks!"

01:25:45.724,01:25:52.940,I came home the other day and he is with his girlfriend in my marital bed doing things that are illegal in Alabama.
01:25:53.023,01:25:56.318,"Sex acts, right? Things that my wife won't do, okay?"

01:26:10.791,01:26:13.127,I want to stop it-- maybe just for a few years.
01:26:13.209,01:26:15.796,"Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea."
01:26:15.879,01:26:18.966,- Does anybody else have a question? - I have a question.
01:26:19.049,01:26:23.053,I think some of the people here might be sexually inexperienced.

01:26:26.598,01:26:28.433,Is that a serious question?
01:26:28.517,01:26:30.769,"No, it wasn't."
01:26:30.853,01:26:37.484,"Now, there are a lot of activities you can engage in without having sex that are both fun and safe."

01:26:51.206,01:26:54.835,Outercourse is anything that isn't vaginal intercourse.
01:26:54.918,01:26:56.920,I prefer vaginal intercourse.
01:27:00.174,01:27:05.012,"Now, there are ways of having sex without intercourse."
01:27:05.095,01:27:09.808,"Let's see, there are things like body rubbing - or dry humping. - You could dry hump."
01:27:09.892,01:27:13.103,"- There's masturbation, - Masturbation, play with yourself."
01:27:13.187,01:27:15.397,"- Mutual masturbation, - Play with a friend."

01:27:36.877,01:27:38.712,I'd tap that.
01:27:38.795,01:27:40.672,"Oh, yeah, you'd tap that. Seth, what?"
01:27:40.756,01:27:43.217,You think you're cool with your little Jew-fro?
01:27:43.299,01:27:46.720,"We don't say tap that. What-- what are you talking about, Seth?"
01:27:46.803,01:27:49.014,"You know what? I'm a virgin, too."
01:27:51.975,01:27:54.061,- We're virgins too. - Yeah.
01:27:56.021,01:28:00.650,"No, you know what? It's a personal choice, and-- and I don't think it's weird at all."
01:28:00.734,01:28:03.612,You know what your problem is? You're putting the pussy on a pedestal.
01:28:03.695,01:28:05.280,That's the second time I've heard that.
01:28:05.363,01:28:07.741,What is the pussy on a pedestal thing?
01:28:07.824,01:28:12.788,"Okay, I can't listen to any more of this, 'cause it's making me sick, so bye."
01:28:12.871,01:28:15.124,"- You can get this information on your website, right? - Oh, yes."
01:28:15.207,01:28:17.584,"- Thanks, nice meeting everybody. - Any other questions?"
01:28:17.667,01:28:19.836,Do you have any extra-large condoms?
01:28:19.920,01:28:21.922,"Seth, you've got a tiny penis."
01:28:26.176,01:28:28.804,"So, I made that all up to help you out."
01:28:31.056,01:28:33.058,"No, you didn't."
01:28:33.142,01:28:37.771,"But, um, thank you for doing that."

01:32:11.318,01:32:18.158,"Listen, it's really important because once the integrity of the box gets compromised-- this is original packaging and that's why these things are so valuable."
01:32:18.241,01:32:19.951,So you don't-- you don't screw with that.
01:32:20.035,01:32:21.828,- You really don't screw with that. - All right.

01:32:49.481,01:32:52.067,- I-- I'm not making-- - You're encouraging me to quit my job.

01:33:16.508,01:33:18.968,I ride a bike because I like to. Einstein rode a bike.
01:33:19.052,01:33:22.097,"He had a wife, who he fucked, by the way."
01:33:22.180,01:33:24.807,What do I have to do for you to have sex with me?
01:33:24.891,01:33:27.852,Do you want me to dress up like Thor? I'll dress up like Thor.

01:33:35.944,01:33:39.739,You tell me the truth. Is it because I have a kid who has a kid? Is that why?
01:33:39.822,01:33:42.409,"No, it's cool! I love the fact that you're a grandmother."
01:33:42.492,01:33:45.287,- Oh God! - You are! You're a hot grandma!

01:33:49.791,01:33:52.710,"- Good, fine, you're gonna go. - I didn't ask for any of this."
01:33:52.794,01:33:57.048,"- You asked for all of it, Andy! - Okay, great."
01:33:59.884,01:34:05.848,"Hey, if that's the way you want it, that's the way homie's gonna play it."
01:34:06.933,01:34:08.935,"Yeah, truth be told."
01:34:26.286,01:34:32.666,"Ooh, baby, you better enjoy yourself tonight, 'cause once this baby's born, - you ain't going out again till that baby's in college. - Me?"

01:34:45.305,01:34:51.269,"Yes, you are, man! 'Cause your depression is boring me for one thing and it's actually making me a little depressed."
01:34:51.353,01:34:54.606,Which is then in turn making me more depressed that you're actually affecting my mood.
01:34:54.688,01:34:58.485,"Look, I'm not in any kind of place to talk to a woman, all right?"
01:34:58.568,01:35:00.445,I'm just-- I'm fragile.
01:35:00.529,01:35:02.656,I hired her for you.
01:35:02.738,01:35:07.661,"I hired a 90-lb. girl to work in the stock room at Smart Tech for you, okay?"
01:35:07.743,01:35:17.003,"I should've hired a 300-lb. guy who could lift a 60 wide screen, but instead I hired a hot girl who can't lift an iPod to bring you out of your funk."

01:35:19.755,01:35:22.175,"- So will you go talk to her? - Yeah, I'm meeting somebody."

01:36:50.513,01:36:54.142,"Let me ask you that! You know what?! You don't have an answer for that, do you?!"
01:36:57.019,01:36:59.021,"You're such a good guy, and I appreciate you."

01:40:54.131,01:40:56.175,What do you like?
01:40:56.258,01:40:58.386,I don't-- I don't know.
01:40:58.469,01:41:00.513,What do you like?
01:41:00.596,01:41:02.515,Can I show you what I like?
01:41:07.937,01:41:15.528,"Hey, hi, it's-- it's me and, uh, I'm on my way to your house. I want to do whatever you want to do, okay?"
01:41:15.611,01:41:17.697,"50 dates, 100."
01:41:17.780,01:41:19.699,"I hope not, but-- whatever."
01:41:19.782,01:41:22.117,"I'm gonna see you soon, okay?"
01:41:22.201,01:41:24.037,Bye.
01:41:28.624,01:41:31.711,"Oh, it's so hot in here."
01:41:31.794,01:41:36.507,I want to introduce you to my friend.
01:41:42.137,01:41:45.433,This guy knows exactly what I like.
01:41:49.938,01:41:51.981,Where's your friend going?
01:41:54.316,01:41:56.611,This is how I'm gonna warm up for you.
01:41:56.694,01:41:59.072,"That's always good, to warm up."
01:41:59.154,01:42:01.032,You don't want to pull something.
01:42:18.215,01:42:20.133,Wow.
01:42:20.217,01:42:22.971,This is graphic.
01:42:41.530,01:42:46.452,"We came here 'cause we were concerned about you and Trish, and now I could not give a fuck."
01:42:46.535,01:42:48.955,How did you even know where she lives?
01:42:49.038,01:42:50.957,"I hit it, like eight months back."
01:42:51.040,01:42:53.042,- What?! - Never gave her back the key.
01:42:53.126,01:42:56.462,"Man, you-- you have no idea where this is going. That girl is a freak."
01:42:56.545,01:42:58.798,"Beth: Oh, it's happening! It's happening!"
01:43:00.549,01:43:06.305,"- Oh, you think? - We've been talking, and-- look. If you love Trish, you can't do this."
01:43:06.388,01:43:11.769,"Look, you guys, I don't know what I'm doing anymore, I don't even know who I am."
01:43:11.853,01:43:18.067,"All I know is that woman scares the shit out of me and I just want to go home, okay?"
01:43:18.151,01:43:20.528,"- Let's go. - Yeah, we should all get out of here."
01:43:20.611,01:43:23.072,- Okay. - Cal: We should all go.
01:43:23.156,01:43:26.408,- It wasn't that good for me. - We should totally get out of here.
01:43:37.753,01:43:39.714,Cal.
01:43:41.590,01:43:44.093,Go around!
01:43:44.177,01:43:46.303,"Come on, just go around me!"
01:43:49.598,01:43:51.851,Can't you hear me?!
01:43:57.815,01:43:59.650,"Hey, there."
01:43:59.734,01:44:01.569,"Hi, Trish."
01:44:05.489,01:44:07.575,What's this?
01:44:07.658,01:44:09.660,"Oh, those are David's."
01:44:11.412,01:44:13.246,I think he has a problem.
01:44:13.330,01:44:15.374,These are David's?
01:44:15.457,01:44:18.419,- He's into that. - David's...
01:44:18.502,01:44:20.546,Boner Jams '03?
01:44:20.629,01:44:22.924,"Yeah, God, it was-- it's so sad."
01:44:23.007,01:44:25.593,He compiled all the best boner scenes I guess.
01:44:28.846,01:44:31.264,What does this look like?
01:44:31.348,01:44:34.267,A vagina.
01:44:34.351,01:44:36.437,- And what do you with this vagina? - To learn.
01:44:39.607,01:44:42.484,"- Hey, I'm sorry. God-- - What's this?"
01:44:42.568,01:44:44.695,This your-- your date drug?
01:44:44.779,01:44:48.032,- Your roofie? - It's a Mentos.
01:44:48.116,01:44:51.953,"- They're the Freshmaker. - Yeah, right."
01:44:52.036,01:44:57.959,"What are you some kind of sex pervert, a deviant-- - No, I'm not a sexual deviant. - Well, what is all this?"
01:44:58.042,01:45:03.380,"I haven't even tried to have sex with you, so-- What are you trying to do? What are you buttering me up for?"
01:45:03.464,01:45:06.341,"- Aw, come on. - You're not gonna try and kill me, are you?"
01:45:06.425,01:45:09.386,"- Look, Trish-- - You didn't get a new carpet..."
01:45:09.470,01:45:11.346,I am not trying to kill you.
01:45:11.430,01:45:13.599,I love you.
01:45:13.682,01:45:15.476,- I love you! - Oh God! Oh!
01:45:15.559,01:45:17.728,Trish.
01:45:25.611,01:45:28.197,Trish! No no!
01:45:28.281,01:45:30.783,"No! No, Trish, stop!"
01:45:40.084,01:45:42.253,I need to talk to you!
01:45:45.173,01:45:47.049,Damn it!
01:46:16.287,01:46:19.623,- Ah! - Oh! Oh my God!
01:46:21.500,01:46:24.295,"- Wow. - Oh, Andy."
01:46:24.377,01:46:26.172,"Andy, oh my God!"
01:46:26.255,01:46:28.174,Call 911!
01:46:28.257,01:46:30.383,- Oh my-- Andy! - Wow wow.
01:46:30.467,01:46:33.637,"- Oh my God. - Yep, just-- I'm gonna need a minute."
01:46:33.721,01:46:35.890,- Oh my-- - I'm in a lot of pain right now.
01:46:35.973,01:46:38.226,"Oh my God, are you okay?"
01:46:40.644,01:46:42.395,and they both hurt equally.
01:46:42.479,01:46:45.233,"Oh, Andy! Andy."
01:46:47.151,01:46:49.904,- Are you okay? - I'm okay.
01:46:49.987,01:46:52.405,"No, I'm not okay."
01:46:52.489,01:46:54.367,I'm a virgin.
01:46:56.369,01:46:58.453,A what?
01:46:58.537,01:47:02.041,I'm a virgin. I always have been.
01:47:02.124,01:47:05.460,"- Shoot. - Andy, is that what all this was about?"
01:47:05.544,01:47:07.629,I'm sorry.
01:47:07.713,01:47:10.423,"You're just a virgin, that's all?"
01:47:10.507,01:47:13.135,- Yeah. - That's good. That's a good thing.
01:47:14.803,01:47:16.931,I feel stupid.
01:47:18.807,01:47:21.185,"It's okay, I thought you were trying to kill me."
01:47:23.354,01:47:25.106,No.
01:47:25.189,01:47:27.191,Oh my God.
01:47:27.275,01:47:29.277,"No, I'm not trying to kill you."
01:47:35.908,01:47:38.119,I was scared.
01:47:38.202,01:47:44.292,"Okay, I just-- 'cause I didn't know what I was doing, I just didn't think it would be good."
01:47:44.375,01:47:46.752,"Of course it'll be good, we love each other."
01:47:48.545,01:47:50.798,Really?
01:47:50.881,01:47:52.841,I love you.
01:47:54.302,01:47:56.304,Yeah.
01:48:02.059,01:48:05.729,"Shut up, you fuckin' jerk!"
01:48:05.813,01:48:08.399,"No, that's okay. That's all right! Sorry!"
01:48:10.067,01:48:16.489,"You know what? For so long, I've thought that there was something wrong with me, because it had never happened."
01:48:16.573,01:48:19.160,But...
01:48:19.243,01:48:23.372,I realize now that it was just because I was waiting for you.
01:48:48.314,01:48:50.941,This is some wedding. How did they pay for all of it?
01:48:51.025,01:48:54.736,Dude sells his toys and makes like a half a million dollars.
01:48:54.820,01:48:56.697,"- That's crazy, right? - That's fuckin' crazy."
01:48:56.780,01:48:58.699,We gonna get some fuckin' toys.
01:48:58.782,01:49:08.083,"We are all so happy for you, and I am delighted to say these words: Andy, you may kiss the bride."
01:49:17.301,01:49:19.261,Yeah!
01:49:19.345,01:49:21.889,Woo!
01:49:21.972,01:49:24.933,"And for God's sake, consummate the thing!"
01:49:30.398,01:49:31.773,"No no no, stop it!"
01:49:31.857,01:49:33.984,"I have the key, I have the key."
01:49:41.158,01:49:46.747,"buffing the marble for about a half an hour, but you can come in and sit down if you want."
01:49:46.830,01:49:49.708,"Or wait in the lobby, it's okay. It's up to you."
01:49:57.508,01:49:59.760,"Dude, get the fuck out of here!"
01:50:08.852,01:50:11.063,Ah.
01:50:11.146,01:50:13.148,- Ready? - Yeah.

01:50:31.750,01:50:33.752,Cool.
01:50:43.971,01:50:45.973,Ooh.
01:50:48.976,01:50:51.604,Wanna do it again?
01:50:51.686,01:50:54.106,"- Yeah, sure. - Good, okay."
01:50:55.483,01:50:57.650,That was-- that was good. That was okay.
01:51:01.280,01:51:02.823,"- Okay. - Okay, you ready?"
01:51:02.906,01:51:05.658,"- Are you ready? - Yeah, I'm fine."
01:51:18.422,01:51:20.882,So how was that for you?
