00:01:26.628,00:01:32.050,"She was locked away in a castle, guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon."
00:01:33.259,00:01:39.349,"Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed."
00:01:40.600,00:01:49.359,"She waited in the dragon's keep, in the highest room of the tallest tower, for her true love and true love's first kiss."
00:03:33.212,00:03:35.006,-Go! -Go!
00:04:02.533,00:04:05.787,-Think it's in there? -All right. Let's get it!
00:04:05.912,00:04:08.289,Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?
00:04:08.373,00:04:11.459,"Yeah, it'll grind your bones for its bread."
00:04:19.634,00:04:22.720,They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin.
00:04:22.804,00:04:25.056,-No! -They'll shave your liver.
00:04:25.139,00:04:27.809,Squeeze the jelly from your eyes!
00:04:28.101,00:04:30.853,"-Actually, it's quite good on toast. -Back! Back, beast!"
00:04:30.937,00:04:32.981,Back! I warn ya!
00:05:05.555,00:05:07.265,And stay out!
00:05:11.311,00:05:13.313,Wanted. Fairy tale creatures.
00:05:24.407,00:05:26.993,-Move it along. Come on! Get up! -Next!
00:05:28.411,00:05:31.247,Give me that! Your flying days are over.
00:05:31.372,00:05:34.042,That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next!
00:05:34.125,00:05:36.711,-Get up! Come on! -Twenty pieces.
00:05:42.216,00:05:44.719,This cage is too small.
00:05:44.844,00:05:46.637,Please don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again.
00:05:46.721,00:05:48.639,I can change. Please! Give me another chance!
00:05:51.559,00:05:54.479,-What have you got? -This little wooden puppet.
00:05:54.562,00:05:57.190,I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy.
00:05:59.567,00:06:01.611,Five shillings for the possessed toy.
00:06:01.694,00:06:03.988,"-Take it away. Father, please! -Don't let them do this!"
00:06:04.072,00:06:05.656,-Help me! -Next. What have you got?
00:06:08.993,00:06:12.997,"Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it."
00:06:13.081,00:06:15.374,"Oh, go ahead, little fella."
00:06:18.377,00:06:19.462,Well?
00:06:19.587,00:06:22.131,"Oh, oh, he's just-- He's just a little nervous."
00:06:22.215,00:06:32.892,"He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt-- He does. I can talk. I love to talk."
00:06:33.059,00:06:35.436,I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw.
00:06:37.146,00:06:38.773,"-Get her out of my sight. -No, no!"
00:06:38.856,00:06:41.943,I swear! Oh! He can talk!
00:06:46.322,00:06:48.074,Hey! I can fly!
00:06:48.157,00:06:49.742,He can fly! He can fly!
00:06:50.076,00:06:52.703,"-He can talk! -Ha, ha! That's right, fool!"
00:06:52.787,00:06:54.831,"Now I'm a flying, talking donkey."
00:06:54.914,00:07:00.795,"You might have seen a house fly, maybe even a super fly, but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly."
00:07:00.878,00:07:02.171,"Ha, ha!"
00:07:03.506,00:07:04.590,Uh-oh.
00:07:07.218,00:07:08.136,Seize him!
00:07:30.241,00:07:32.535,You there. Ogre!
00:07:32.910,00:07:34.036,Aye?
00:07:34.328,00:07:44.755,"By the order of Lord Farquaad, I am authorized to place you both under arrest, and transport you to a designated... resettlement facility."
00:07:45.089,00:07:48.301,"Oh, really? You and what army?"
00:07:59.937,00:08:01.063,Can I say something to you?
00:08:01.731,00:08:05.067,"Listen, you was really, really somethin' back there. Incredible!"
00:08:05.276,00:08:11.491,Are you talkin' to-- me? Whoa!
00:08:11.574,00:08:14.118,"Yes, I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you was great back there?"
00:08:14.202,00:08:15.036,Those guards!
00:08:15.244,00:08:17.580,"They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam!"
00:08:17.788,00:08:19.832,They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods.
00:08:19.916,00:08:22.001,That really made me feel good to see that.
00:08:22.126,00:08:24.837,"-Oh, that's great. Really. -Man, it's good to be free."
00:08:24.921,00:08:29.550,"Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?"
00:08:30.635,00:08:33.429,"But, uh, I don't have any friends."
00:08:34.013,00:08:36.140,And I'm not goin' out there by myself.
00:08:36.766,00:08:39.268,"Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you."
00:08:39.602,00:08:41.312,"You're a mean, green, fightin' machine."
00:08:41.395,00:08:43.856,Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.
00:08:48.069,00:08:50.530,"Oh, wow! That was really scary."
00:08:52.740,00:08:57.453,"your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause your breath stinks!"
00:08:59.288,00:09:05.378,"You almost burned the hair outta my nose, Then I ate some rotten berries."
00:09:05.461,00:09:07.755,I had strong gases eking out of my butt that day.
00:09:08.005,00:09:10.424,Why are you following me?
00:09:11.467,00:09:12.635,I'll tell you why.
00:09:30.570,00:09:32.363,Stop singing!
00:09:32.989,00:09:35.658,"Well, It's no wonder you don't have any friends."
00:09:36.242,00:09:39.078,Wow. Only a true friend would be that truly honest.
00:09:39.161,00:09:43.332,"Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?"
00:09:48.379,00:09:51.257,-Really tall? -No! I'm an ogre.
00:09:51.549,00:09:54.510,You know. Grab your torch and pitchforks.
00:09:55.011,00:09:56.596,Doesn't that bother you?
00:09:59.974,00:10:01.767,"-Really? -Really, really."
00:10:02.268,00:10:05.146,"-Oh. -Man, I like you. What's your name?"
00:10:05.605,00:10:08.107,"Uh, Shrek."
00:10:09.150,00:10:11.986,"Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek?"
00:10:12.320,00:10:15.406,You got that kind of I-don't-care-what- nobody-thinks-of-me thing.
00:10:15.489,00:10:18.326,"I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right."
00:10:20.453,00:10:24.498,Whoo! Look at that. Who'd want to live in a place like that?
00:10:25.249,00:10:27.126,That would be my home.
00:10:27.877,00:10:30.671,Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful.
00:10:30.755,00:10:31.922,"You know, you are quite a decorator."
00:10:32.006,00:10:34.091,It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget.
00:10:34.634,00:10:37.845,I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder.
00:10:43.517,00:10:45.895,"I guess you don't entertain much, do you?"
00:10:45.978,00:10:47.855,I like my privacy.
00:10:48.230,00:10:50.358,"You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common."
00:10:50.441,00:10:52.193,"Like, I hate it when you got somebody in your face."
00:10:52.276,00:10:53.944,"You're trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave."
00:10:54.028,00:10:56.113,"There's that awkward silence, you know."
00:11:00.117,00:11:02.203,"-Can I stay with you? -Uh, what?"
00:11:02.912,00:11:04.955,"Can I stay with you, please?"
00:11:05.581,00:11:07.541,-Of course! -Really?
00:11:07.625,00:11:10.294,-No. -Please! I don't wanna go back there!
00:11:10.378,00:11:14.173,"You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. Well, maybe you do."
00:11:14.256,00:11:16.801,But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay!
00:11:16.884,00:11:19.970,Please! Please! Okay! Okay!
00:11:20.262,00:11:22.807,-But one night only. -Ah! Thank you!
00:11:22.890,00:11:24.975,-What are you-- No! No! -This is gonna be fun!
00:11:25.059,00:11:29.397,"We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles."
00:11:29.772,00:11:33.192,"-Oh! -Where do, uh, I sleep?"
00:11:33.609,00:11:35.152,Outside!
00:11:36.153,00:11:38.489,"Oh, well, I guess that's cool."
00:11:38.697,00:11:42.868,"I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know."
00:11:56.549,00:11:59.301,"I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know."
00:11:59.427,00:12:00.594,"By myself, outside."
00:13:22.510,00:13:26.430,"Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have?"
00:13:26.514,00:13:29.016,"It's not home, but it'll do just fine."
00:13:29.225,00:13:30.976,What a lovely bed.
00:13:37.900,00:13:39.985,"-Is that you, Gorder? -How did you know?"
00:13:40.069,00:13:43.489,Enough! What are you doing in my house?
00:13:47.701,00:13:49.620,Dead broad off the table.
00:13:49.703,00:13:51.872,Where are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken.
00:13:56.168,00:13:57.086,What?
00:13:57.586,00:14:02.633,I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre!
00:14:02.716,00:14:05.844,What do I have to do to get a little privacy?
00:14:05.928,00:14:07.888,"-Aah! -Oh, no."
00:14:08.931,00:14:10.391,"Oh, no."
00:14:17.398,00:14:19.316,-Quit it. -Don't push.
00:14:23.737,00:14:26.448,What are you doing in my swamp?
00:14:32.621,00:14:33.706,Whoa!
00:14:35.332,00:14:37.960,"All right, get out of here. All of you, move it!"
00:14:38.043,00:14:40.921,Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey!
00:14:41.005,00:14:42.256,"-Quickly. Come on! -No, no!"
00:14:42.339,00:14:44.258,"No, no. Not there. Not there."
00:14:48.971,00:14:50.848,"Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them."
00:14:50.931,00:14:52.892,"Oh, gosh, no one invited us."
00:14:53.017,00:14:55.728,-What? -We were forced to come here.
00:14:55.895,00:14:58.147,-By who? -Lord Farquaad.
00:14:58.647,00:15:02.735,He huffed und he puffed und he... signed an eviction notice.
00:15:05.821,00:15:09.825,Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?
00:15:13.037,00:15:16.582,Does anyone else know where to find him?
00:15:18.542,00:15:20.419,-Anyone at all? -Me! Me!
00:15:20.502,00:15:22.254,"-Anyone? -Oh! Oh, pick me!"
00:15:22.338,00:15:24.423,"Oh, I know! I know! Me, me!"
00:15:28.135,00:15:32.389,"Attention, all fairy tale things."
00:15:32.932,00:15:36.977,Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out.
00:15:37.061,00:15:44.401,"In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from!"
00:15:52.201,00:15:54.328,Oh! You!
00:15:55.204,00:15:56.622,You're comin' with me.
00:15:57.206,00:15:59.500,"All right, that's what I like to hear, man."
00:15:59.583,00:16:03.462,"Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure."
00:16:03.545,00:16:04.713,I love it!
00:16:06.882,00:16:08.300,Sing it with me Shrek.
00:16:10.886,00:16:13.222,What did I say about singing?
00:16:13.305,00:16:14.556,-Can I whistle? -No.
00:16:14.640,00:16:17.309,"-Can I hum it? -All right, hum it."
00:16:47.423,00:16:49.883,That's enough. He's ready to talk.
00:17:03.397,00:17:05.899,"Run, run, run, as fast as you can."
00:17:05.983,00:17:09.319,You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man!
00:17:09.403,00:17:12.906,-You're a monster. -I'm not the monster here. You are.
00:17:12.990,00:17:17.244,"You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world."
00:17:17.786,00:17:19.371,"Now, tell me! Where are the others?"
00:17:21.874,00:17:25.002,I've tried to be fair to you creatures.
00:17:25.085,00:17:31.467,"Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll-- No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons."
00:17:31.550,00:17:33.510,All right then. Who's hiding them?
00:17:33.761,00:17:39.016,"Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man?"
00:17:39.099,00:17:41.351,-The muffin man? -The muffin man.
00:17:41.602,00:17:44.897,"Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?"
00:17:44.980,00:17:48.400,"Well, she's married to the muffin man."
00:17:48.484,00:17:50.652,-The muffin man? -The muffin man!
00:17:53.739,00:17:55.324,My lord! We found it.
00:17:55.699,00:17:58.118,Then what are you waiting for? Bring it in.
00:18:13.467,00:18:17.054,-Magic mirror-- -Don't tell him anything!
00:18:17.304,00:18:18.847,No!
00:18:23.435,00:18:25.312,"Mirror, mirror, on the wall."
00:18:25.395,00:18:28.732,Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all?
00:18:29.066,00:18:31.527,"Well, technically you're not a king."
00:18:31.860,00:18:33.278,"Uh, Thelonius."
00:18:34.988,00:18:38.367,"-You were saying? -What I mean is, you're not a king yet."
00:18:38.617,00:18:42.287,But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess.
00:18:45.415,00:18:53.215,"So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes."
00:18:53.298,00:18:56.718,And here they are!
00:18:59.930,00:19:01.723,"from a kingdom far, far away."
00:19:01.932,00:19:04.309,She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime.
00:19:04.601,00:19:07.896,Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters.
00:19:11.150,00:19:14.611,Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy.
00:19:14.695,00:19:17.447,"Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy."
00:19:17.531,00:19:21.034,"Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is."
00:19:21.118,00:19:24.580,Come on. Give it up for Snow White!
00:19:24.997,00:19:29.626,"And last, but certainly not least, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead..."
00:19:29.710,00:19:32.254,from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava!
00:19:32.337,00:19:33.881,But don't let that cool you off.
00:19:33.964,00:19:37.718,She's a loaded pistol who likes pina coladas and getting caught in the rain.
00:19:37.801,00:19:41.471,"Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona!"
00:19:42.014,00:19:47.853,"So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three?"
00:19:48.145,00:19:50.397,-Two! Two! -Three! Three!
00:19:50.480,00:19:51.773,-Two! Two! -Three!
00:19:54.109,00:19:56.195,"Three! Pick number three, my lord!"
00:19:56.278,00:19:59.531,"Okay, okay, uh, number three!"
00:19:59.907,00:20:04.453,"Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona."
00:20:09.708,00:20:11.793,Princess Fiona.
00:20:13.128,00:20:14.046,She's perfect.
00:20:14.463,00:20:19.551,All I have to do is just find someone who can go-- But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night.
00:20:19.635,00:20:29.269,"-I'll do it. -Yes, but after sunset-- Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king!"
00:20:29.686,00:20:31.855,"Captain, assemble your finest men."
00:20:32.356,00:20:34.524,We're going to have a tournament.
00:20:38.654,00:20:40.739,But that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc.
00:20:40.989,00:20:42.407,I told ya I'd find it.
00:20:42.616,00:20:46.662,"So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle."
00:20:49.456,00:20:52.084,Do you think maybe he's compensating for something?
00:20:57.130,00:20:58.757,"Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek."
00:20:59.216,00:21:01.843,"Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry."
00:21:06.431,00:21:09.810,"Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat ya."
00:21:44.928,00:21:45.971,It's quiet.
00:21:49.099,00:21:50.225,Too quiet.
00:21:53.520,00:21:57.399,"Where is everybody? Hey, look at this!"
00:22:45.197,00:22:48.909,Wow! Let's do that again!
00:22:48.992,00:22:51.411,"No. No. No, no, no! No."
00:22:56.458,00:22:58.585,You are the best and brightest in all the land.
00:23:00.670,00:23:05.425,Today one of you shall prove himself-- All right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom.
00:23:08.220,00:23:20.607,"That champion shall have the honour-- No, no, the privilege, to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona, from the fiery keep of the dragon."
00:23:20.857,00:23:30.450,"If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place, and so on and so forth."
00:23:31.243,00:23:36.623,"Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make."
00:23:41.920,00:23:44.047,Let the tournament begin!
00:23:53.014,00:23:56.726,"-It's hideous! -Ah, that's not very nice."
00:23:57.978,00:24:00.147,-It's just a donkey. -Huh?
00:24:00.480,00:24:03.191,"Indeed. Knights, new plan!"
00:24:03.441,00:24:08.029,The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have at him!
00:24:09.114,00:24:12.784,"Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now."
00:24:15.036,00:24:17.706,Can't we just settle this over a pint?
00:24:19.541,00:24:22.294,No? All right then.
00:24:24.296,00:24:25.505,Come on!
00:24:57.329,00:24:59.039,"Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!"
00:25:08.048,00:25:08.882,Yeah!
00:25:11.384,00:25:13.094,The chair! Give him the chair!
00:25:32.489,00:25:38.078,"Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah!"
00:25:38.161,00:25:40.664,Thank you! Thank you very much!
00:25:40.872,00:25:43.124,"I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha!"
00:25:50.006,00:25:51.383,"Shall I give the order, sir?"
00:25:51.716,00:25:54.928,"No, I have a better idea."
00:25:55.595,00:26:00.225,"People of DuLoc, I give you our champion!"
00:26:04.729,00:26:08.650,You've won the honour of embarking on a great and noble quest.
00:26:08.858,00:26:13.446,"Quest? I'm already on a quest, a quest to get my swamp back."
00:26:13.530,00:26:16.533,"-Your swamp? -Yeah, my swamp!"
00:26:16.741,00:26:19.411,Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures!
00:26:22.080,00:26:24.207,"All right, ogre, I'll make you a deal."
00:26:24.291,00:26:28.128,"Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back."
00:26:28.795,00:26:30.922,Exactly the way it was?
00:26:31.131,00:26:33.758,Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.
00:26:33.842,00:26:37.053,-And the squatters? -As good as gone.
00:26:40.807,00:26:42.517,What kind of quest?
00:26:46.813,00:26:52.444,"and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp, which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place."
00:26:52.527,00:26:53.570,Is that about right?
00:26:53.653,00:26:56.990,Maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.
00:26:57.157,00:27:00.785,I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that ogre stuff on him?
00:27:00.869,00:27:05.623,"Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grind his bones to make your bread, the whole ogre trip."
00:27:05.707,00:27:07.584,"Oh, I know what."
00:27:07.667,00:27:15.717,"Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids."
00:27:16.134,00:27:17.761,Does that sound good to you?
00:27:18.011,00:27:20.513,"Uh, no, not really, no."
00:27:20.972,00:27:24.726,"For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think."
00:27:24.934,00:27:27.020,Example? Example?
00:27:33.943,00:27:35.278,-Yes-- No! -They make you cry?
00:27:35.487,00:27:39.449,"-No. -Oh,You leave them out in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs."
00:27:39.574,00:27:41.576,No! Layers!
00:27:41.993,00:27:44.287,Onions have layers.
00:27:44.371,00:27:46.998,Ogres have layers! Onions have layers.
00:27:52.003,00:27:55.090,"Oh, you both have layers. Oh."
00:27:58.968,00:28:01.846,Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers.
00:28:01.930,00:28:05.141,I don't care... what everyone likes.
00:28:05.683,00:28:08.978,Ogres are not like cakes.
00:28:11.773,00:28:13.817,You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits.
00:28:13.900,00:28:18.071,"Have you ever met a person, you say, Let's get some parfait, they say, No, I don't like no parfait?"
00:28:18.154,00:28:20.031,-Parfaits are delicious. -No!
00:28:20.115,00:28:23.284,"You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden!"
00:28:23.368,00:28:26.121,Ogres are like onions! End of story.
00:28:26.204,00:28:28.623,Bye-bye. See ya later.
00:28:33.378,00:28:36.714,Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.
00:28:42.595,00:28:45.348,Just the word parfait make me start slobbering.
00:29:25.180,00:29:27.223,Ooh! Shrek! Did you do that?
00:29:27.682,00:29:30.393,You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off.
00:29:30.477,00:29:31.561,My mouth was open and everything.
00:29:31.644,00:29:34.814,"Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead."
00:29:37.984,00:29:40.820,"-We must be getting close. -Yeah, right, brimstone."
00:29:41.696,00:29:42.989,Don't be talking about it's the brimstone.
00:29:43.072,00:29:45.283,I know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone.
00:29:45.366,00:29:47.535,It didn't come off no stone neither.
00:30:05.678,00:30:08.640,"Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location."
00:30:11.726,00:30:17.440,"Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said ogres have layers?"
00:30:17.524,00:30:18.817,"Oh, aye."
00:30:19.859,00:30:21.945,"Well, I have a bit of a confession to make."
00:30:22.362,00:30:25.740,Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves.
00:30:25.824,00:30:29.911,-Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves -You know what I mean.
00:30:29.994,00:30:32.622,You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.
00:30:32.705,00:30:37.293,"No, I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over a boiling lake of lava!"
00:30:37.585,00:30:41.506,"Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay?"
00:30:41.589,00:30:48.346,"For emotional support, we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step at a time."
00:30:48.805,00:30:50.431,"-Really? -Really, really."
00:30:50.890,00:30:54.143,"-Okay, that makes me feel so much better. -Just keep moving."
00:30:54.227,00:30:55.854,And don't look down.
00:30:55.937,00:30:58.857,"Don't look down. Okay, don't look down."
00:30:59.065,00:31:02.485,Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't look down.
00:31:06.322,00:31:09.158,"Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, please!"
00:31:09.242,00:31:12.662,-But you're already halfway. -But I know that half is safe!
00:31:12.745,00:31:15.874,"Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back."
00:31:15.957,00:31:21.546,"-Shrek, no! Wait! -Just, Donkey-- -Let's have a dance then, shall we? -Don't do that!"
00:31:22.088,00:31:24.465,"Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?"
00:31:25.258,00:31:28.386,"-Oh, this? -Yes, that!"
00:31:28.469,00:31:31.848,"Yes? Yes, do it. Okay."
00:31:34.559,00:31:37.687,-No! Stop it! You said do it! -I'm doin' it.
00:31:37.812,00:31:40.899,"I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die."
00:31:41.941,00:31:42.901,Oh!
00:31:44.485,00:31:46.946,"That'll do, Donkey. That'll do."
00:31:52.076,00:31:53.161,Cool.
00:31:57.332,00:31:59.876,"Inside, waiting for us to rescue her."
00:32:21.481,00:32:24.776,"No, but-- Shh."
00:32:29.072,00:32:31.658,'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid.
00:32:31.741,00:32:34.911,Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation.
00:32:34.994,00:32:37.038,"Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might add."
00:32:37.121,00:32:43.086,"With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared you know what I mean."
00:32:47.882,00:32:51.010,"Donkey, two things, okay?"
00:32:51.594,00:32:53.388,Shut... up.
00:32:54.055,00:32:56.432,Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs.
00:32:56.516,00:32:59.102,Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess.
00:32:59.185,00:33:04.065,The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower.
00:33:04.357,00:33:07.235,-What makes you think she'll be there? -I read it in a book once.
00:33:08.486,00:33:11.698,Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs.
00:33:12.031,00:33:14.617,I'll find those stairs. I'll whip their butt too.
00:33:14.701,00:33:16.911,That's right. Those stairs won't know which way they're goin'.
00:33:22.125,00:33:23.292,I'm gonna take drastic steps.
00:33:23.376,00:33:26.170,Kick it to the kerb. Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master.
00:33:26.254,00:33:28.965,"I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a step right here, right here."
00:33:29.048,00:33:30.383,I'd step all over it.
00:33:34.137,00:34:37.867,"Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the-- Oh! Aah! Aah!"
00:34:53.841,00:35:02.100,"I mean, white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all the time from your food, but you must bleach, or something, 'cause that is one dazzling smile you got there."
00:35:02.183,00:35:04.060,Do I detect a hint of minty freshness?
00:35:05.228,00:35:09.357,And you know what else? You're-- You're a girl dragon!
00:35:09.440,00:35:14.237,"Oh, sure! I mean, of course you're a girl dragon."
00:35:14.320,00:35:17.865,"'Cause, you're just reeking of feminine beauty."
00:35:17.949,00:35:20.326,"Uh, what's the matter with you? You got something in your eye?"
00:35:21.035,00:35:23.746,Ooh. Oh. Oh.
00:35:26.290,00:35:29.836,"I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna blow smoke rings and stuff."
00:35:36.217,00:35:37.343,Shrek!
00:36:09.834,00:36:10.835,Oh! Oh!
00:36:10.918,00:36:12.253,-Wake up! -What?
00:36:12.628,00:36:14.297,Are you Princess Fiona?
00:36:15.089,00:36:19.635,"I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me."
00:36:19.719,00:36:21.888,"Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!"
00:36:21.971,00:36:23.764,"But wait, Sir Knight."
00:36:24.015,00:36:25.808,This be-ith our first meeting.
00:36:26.392,00:36:30.021,"Should it not be a wonderful, romantic moment?"
00:36:30.104,00:36:34.483,"-Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time. -Hey, wait. What are you doing?"
00:36:34.817,00:36:40.031,"You should sweep me off my feet, out yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed."
00:36:40.448,00:36:43.242,"You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?"
00:36:47.288,00:36:49.749,But we have to savour this moment!
00:36:50.291,00:36:52.960,You could recite an epic poem for me.
00:36:53.169,00:36:55.463,A ballad? A sonnet!
00:36:55.546,00:36:59.050,-A limerick? Or something! -I don't think so.
00:36:59.342,00:37:03.554,"Well, can I at least know the name of my champion?"
00:37:03.721,00:37:05.598,"Um, Shrek."
00:37:09.644,00:37:14.065,I pray that you take this favour as a token of my gratitude.
00:37:15.566,00:37:16.484,Thanks!
00:37:21.322,00:37:23.282,You didn't slay the dragon?
00:37:28.037,00:37:30.581,"You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying."
00:37:30.998,00:37:32.917,That's what all the other knights did.
00:37:35.586,00:37:37.964,That's not the point. Oh!
00:37:38.673,00:37:41.342,Wait. Where are you going? The exit's over there.
00:37:41.509,00:37:43.511,"Well, I have to save my ass."
00:37:43.886,00:37:46.597,What kind of knight are you?
00:37:47.390,00:37:48.432,One of a kind.
00:37:51.936,00:37:55.606,I believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time.
00:37:59.277,00:38:02.071,I don't want to rush into a physical relationship.
00:38:02.613,00:38:08.286,"I'm not emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this, uh-- Magnitude really is the word I'm looking for."
00:38:08.369,00:38:11.914,"Magnitude--Hey, that is unwanted physical contact."
00:38:11.998,00:38:13.499,"Hey, what are you doing?"
00:38:14.208,00:38:17.795,"Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little and take this one step at a time."
00:38:17.878,00:38:22.091,We really should get to know each other first as friends or pen pals.
00:38:22.174,00:38:31.017,"'Cause I'm on the road a lot, but I just love receiving cards-- Hey, you know I'd really love to stay, but-- Hey, hey! Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail."
00:38:31.100,00:38:35.062,You're gonna tear it off. I don't give permission-- What are you gonna do with that?
00:38:35.896,00:38:38.941,"Hey, now. No way. No! No!"
00:38:39.025,00:38:42.069,"No, no! No. No, no, no! No! Oh!"
00:39:08.721,00:39:10.181,"-Hi, Princess! -It talks!"
00:39:10.264,00:39:12.641,"Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick."
00:39:19.815,00:39:21.025,Oh!
00:39:50.096,00:39:52.264,"Okay, you two, head for the exit!"
00:39:54.016,00:39:55.684,I'll take care of the dragon.
00:40:54.034,00:40:59.582,You rescued me! You're amazing. You're-- You're wonderful. You're...
00:41:00.875,00:41:02.877,a little unorthodox I'll admit.
00:41:03.002,00:41:07.631,"But thy deed is great, and thine heart is pure."
00:41:12.386,00:41:16.098,And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed?
00:41:16.474,00:41:19.059,I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed.
00:41:19.560,00:41:20.728,She thinks I'm a steed.
00:41:24.231,00:41:26.692,"You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight."
00:41:26.859,00:41:29.487,"-Uh, no. -Why not?"
00:41:29.570,00:41:31.697,I have helmet hair.
00:41:31.906,00:41:35.159,Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer.
00:41:35.242,00:41:37.661,"No, no, you wouldn't-- 'st."
00:41:37.786,00:41:40.414,But how will you kiss me?
00:41:40.581,00:41:44.210,What? That wasn't in the job description.
00:41:45.085,00:41:46.045,Maybe it's a perk.
00:41:46.295,00:41:50.758,"No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes."
00:41:51.175,00:41:54.845,A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon...
00:41:54.929,00:42:00.976,"is rescued by a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss."
00:42:01.268,00:42:03.729,Hmm? With Shrek? You think-- Wait.
00:42:03.812,00:42:06.565,Wait. You think that Shrek is your true love?
00:42:06.941,00:42:09.109,"Well, yes."
00:42:12.780,00:42:14.365,You think Shrek is your true love!
00:42:15.449,00:42:17.326,What is so funny?
00:42:17.660,00:42:20.621,"Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?"
00:42:20.829,00:42:23.624,"Of course, you are. You're my rescuer."
00:42:24.166,00:42:26.293,Now-- Now remove your helmet.
00:42:26.377,00:42:29.171,Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.
00:42:29.255,00:42:31.257,-Just take off the helmet. -I'm not going to.
00:42:31.340,00:42:32.508,-Take it off. -No!
00:42:32.591,00:42:34.134,-Now! -Okay!
00:42:34.385,00:42:38.389,"Easy. As you command, Your Highness."
00:42:49.316,00:42:52.444,You-- You're a-- an ogre.
00:42:53.654,00:42:56.574,"Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming."
00:42:56.657,00:42:58.993,"Well, yes, actually."
00:43:00.786,00:43:03.998,"Oh, no. This is all wrong."
00:43:04.290,00:43:06.041,You're not supposed to be an ogre.
00:43:12.214,00:43:14.049,He's the one who wants to marry you.
00:43:14.258,00:43:16.135,Then why didn't he come rescue me?
00:43:16.594,00:43:19.388,Good question. You should ask him that when we get there.
00:43:20.180,00:43:26.020,"But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some ogre and his-- his pet."
00:43:26.645,00:43:28.480,"Well, so much for noble steed."
00:43:28.564,00:43:31.066,"Look princess, you're not making my job any easier."
00:43:31.150,00:43:33.861,"I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem."
00:43:34.737,00:43:42.453,"You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here."
00:43:42.536,00:43:47.666,"Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? I'm a delivery boy."
00:43:47.916,00:43:49.251,You wouldn't dare.
00:43:52.379,00:43:53.589,I'm right behind ya.
00:43:53.922,00:43:57.468,"Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences!"
00:44:05.559,00:44:08.479,"Say there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't really like her that way."
00:44:08.562,00:44:13.359,"How do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten? How you do that?"
00:44:13.734,00:44:15.944,You just tell her she's not your true love.
00:44:16.236,00:44:23.994,Everyone knowest what happens when you find your-- The sooner we get to DuLoc the better.
00:44:24.161,00:44:27.039,"Oh, you're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful!"
00:44:27.247,00:44:30.459,And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like?
00:44:30.542,00:44:32.586,"Well, Let me put it this way, Princess."
00:44:33.879,00:44:37.966,Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply.
00:44:39.134,00:44:42.638,I don't know. There are those who think little of him.
00:44:45.557,00:44:47.976,"Stop it. Stop it, both of you."
00:44:48.394,00:44:53.399,You're just jealous you can never measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.
00:44:53.482,00:44:56.068,"Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess."
00:44:56.527,00:44:59.947,But I'll let you do the measuring when you see him tomorrow.
00:45:00.030,00:45:03.951,Tomorrow? It'll take that long?
00:45:04.618,00:45:08.372,"-Shouldn't we stop to make camp? -No, that'll take longer."
00:45:08.914,00:45:13.335,-We can keep going. -But there's robbers in the woods.
00:45:13.502,00:45:16.880,"Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camping's starting to sound good."
00:45:16.964,00:45:20.884,"Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this forest."
00:45:20.968,00:45:23.345,I need to find somewhere to camp now!
00:45:30.269,00:45:34.440,"-Hey! Over here. -Shrek, we can do better than that."
00:45:34.523,00:45:36.650,I don't think this is fit for a princess.
00:45:37.151,00:45:40.154,"No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches."
00:45:44.992,00:45:49.455,"A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night."
00:45:49.538,00:45:52.040,You want me to read you a bedtime story? I will.
00:45:57.004,00:45:58.255,"Shrek, what are you doing?"
00:46:02.134,00:46:03.469,I was just kidding.
00:46:13.520,00:46:16.732,the only ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields.
00:46:17.191,00:46:18.859,Right. Yeah.
00:46:21.028,00:46:22.988,"Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?"
00:46:23.071,00:46:26.658,"The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories."
00:46:26.992,00:46:30.037,"Look, there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent."
00:46:30.370,00:46:34.082,-You can guess what he's famous for. -I know you're making this up.
00:46:34.291,00:46:40.088,"No, look. There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench."
00:46:40.172,00:46:42.299,That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.
00:46:42.841,00:46:46.053,"You know Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear."
00:46:47.095,00:46:48.138,Hmm?
00:46:49.097,00:46:50.098,Forget it.
00:46:54.436,00:46:57.564,"Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?"
00:46:58.232,00:46:59.233,Our swamp?
00:46:59.316,00:47:01.944,"You know, when we're through rescuing the princess and all that stuff."
00:47:02.027,00:47:05.948,"We? Donkey, there's no we. There's no our."
00:47:06.198,00:47:08.367,There's just me and my swamp.
00:47:08.992,00:47:12.329,The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall around my land.
00:47:14.414,00:47:15.832,"You cut me deep, Shrek."
00:47:15.958,00:47:17.501,You cut me real deep just now.
00:47:19.503,00:47:20.712,You know what I think?
00:47:20.796,00:47:24.383,I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out.
00:47:24.550,00:47:28.720,"-No, do ya think? -Are you hidin' something?"
00:47:29.054,00:47:30.514,"Never mind, Donkey."
00:47:31.348,00:47:34.393,"Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?"
00:47:34.518,00:47:38.105,"No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it-alone things."
00:47:38.188,00:47:41.650,-Why don't you want to talk about it? -Why do you want to talk about it?
00:47:41.733,00:47:43.527,Why are you blocking? I'm not blocking.
00:47:43.610,00:47:45.862,"Oh, yes, you are. Donkey, I'm warning you."
00:47:45.946,00:47:49.658,-Who you trying to keep out? -Everyone! Okay?
00:47:51.076,00:47:52.995,"Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere."
00:47:53.078,00:47:55.414,Oh! For the love of Pete!
00:47:56.290,00:47:59.084,"What's your problem? What you got against the whole world anyway, huh?"
00:47:59.167,00:48:01.670,"Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay?"
00:48:01.753,00:48:04.256,It's the world that seems to have a problem with me.
00:48:04.715,00:48:08.594,"People take one look at me and go, Aah! Help! Run!"
00:48:08.677,00:48:10.887,"A big, stupid, ugly ogre!"
00:48:16.810,00:48:18.770,That's why I'm better off alone.
00:48:27.654,00:48:28.864,You know what?
00:48:28.947,00:48:32.868,"When we met, I didn't think you was just a big, stupid, ugly ogre."
00:48:34.786,00:48:35.871,"Yeah, I know."
00:48:37.789,00:48:40.709,"So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?"
00:48:41.084,00:48:46.298,"Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying."
00:48:46.923,00:48:50.927,"Okay, okay, I see it now, yeah. The big shiny one, right there. That one there?"
00:48:52.137,00:48:54.514,"-That's the moon. -Oh, okay."
00:49:23.251,00:49:26.922,"Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess."
00:50:42.873,00:50:47.085,"-Come on, baby. I said I like it. -Donkey, wake up."
00:50:47.169,00:50:49.713,-Huh? What? -Wake up.
00:50:52.424,00:50:54.676,"Um, how do you like your eggs?"
00:50:54.843,00:50:58.764,"-Good morning, Princess! -What's all this about?"
00:50:58.847,00:51:02.851,"You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday and..."
00:51:03.185,00:51:04.770,I wanted to make it up to you.
00:51:04.853,00:51:08.857,"I mean, after all, you did rescue me."
00:51:13.111,00:51:16.239,"Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us."
00:51:23.246,00:51:24.956,What? It's a compliment.
00:51:28.210,00:51:29.836,"Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess."
00:51:32.047,00:51:34.508,-Thanks. -She's as nasty as you are.
00:51:35.884,00:51:39.387,"You know, you're not exactly what I expected."
00:51:39.471,00:51:43.475,"Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them."
00:51:50.232,00:51:51.066,Princess!
00:51:54.486,00:51:57.823,"Be still, mon cherie, for I am your saviour!"
00:52:04.955,00:52:07.749,That's my princess! Go find your own!
00:52:07.916,00:52:12.838,"Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a little busy here?"
00:52:12.921,00:52:16.258,"Look, pal, I don't know who you think you are!"
00:52:16.341,00:52:18.718,"Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude."
00:52:18.802,00:52:20.887,Please let me introduce myself.
00:53:12.105,00:53:52.062,"Oh, you little-- Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now."
00:53:52.145,00:53:54.022,-Where did that come from? -What?
00:53:54.105,00:53:56.983,That! Back there. That was amazing!
00:54:02.280,00:54:07.202,"uh, one has to learn these things in case there's a-- -There's an arrow in your butt! -What?"
00:54:07.827,00:54:11.748,"-Oh, would you look at that? -Oh, no. This is all my fault."
00:54:11.831,00:54:13.500,I'm so sorry. Why? What's wrong?
00:54:13.583,00:54:15.543,-Shrek's hurt. -Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt?
00:54:15.835,00:54:17.087,"Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die."
00:54:17.170,00:54:19.714,"-Donkey, I'm okay. -You can't do this to me, Shrek."
00:54:19.798,00:54:21.049,I'm too young for you to die.
00:54:21.132,00:54:22.926,Keep your legs elevated. Turn your head and cough.
00:54:23.218,00:54:26.221,-Does anyone know the Heimlich? -Donkey! Calm down.
00:54:26.429,00:54:31.059,"If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns."
00:54:31.142,00:54:33.812,"Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns."
00:54:33.895,00:54:34.938,"Blue flower, red thorns."
00:54:35.021,00:54:37.983,"Don't die, Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!"
00:54:41.403,00:54:43.363,"-Blue flower, red thorns. -What are the flowers for?"
00:54:43.947,00:54:46.157,-For getting rid of Donkey. -Ah.
00:54:46.241,00:54:48.535,"Now you hold still, and I'll yank this thing out."
00:54:48.618,00:54:50.537,Ow! Hey! Easy with the yankin'.
00:54:50.620,00:54:53.748,"-I'm sorry, but it has to come out. -No, it's tender."
00:54:53.832,00:54:55.500,"Now, hold on."
00:54:55.583,00:54:57.252,-What you're doing is the opposite of help -Don't move.
00:54:57.335,00:55:07.804,"-Okay, look, look, time out. -Would you-- Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns."
00:55:07.887,00:55:09.848,This would be so much easier if I wasn't colour-blind!
00:55:12.308,00:55:13.935,"Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'!"
00:55:16.479,00:55:18.314,Ow! Not good.
00:55:21.443,00:55:23.361,-It's just about-- -Ow! Ohh!
00:55:27.949,00:55:34.330,"Nothing happened. We were just, uh-- Look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do was ask, okay."
00:55:34.414,00:55:37.709,"Oh, come on! That's the last thing on my mind."
00:55:37.959,00:55:41.379,The princess here was just-- Ugh!
00:55:44.841,00:55:47.385,"-Ow! -Hey, what's that?"
00:57:08.758,00:57:09.843,Hey!
00:57:20.937,00:57:22.272,"There it is, Princess."
00:57:23.648,00:57:24.899,Your future awaits you.
00:57:25.483,00:57:27.569,"-That's DuLoc? -Yeah, I know."
00:57:27.652,00:57:32.991,"You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think means he has a really-- Ow!"
00:57:33.199,00:57:37.287,"Um, I, uh-- -I guess we better move on. -Sure."
00:57:37.704,00:57:38.788,"But, Shrek?"
00:57:42.709,00:57:44.794,"-What? -I mean, look at him."
00:57:45.128,00:57:48.173,-He doesn't look so good. -What are you talking about? I'm fine.
00:57:48.256,00:57:51.968,"That's what they always say, and then next thing you know, you're on your back."
00:57:53.636,00:57:55.680,"-Dead. -You know, she's right."
00:57:55.889,00:57:58.558,You look awful. Do you want to sit down?
00:57:58.641,00:58:04.397,"-You know, I'll make you some tea. -I didn't want to say nothin' but, I got this twinge in my neck, and when I turn my head like this, look."
00:58:05.607,00:58:08.651,-Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner. -I'll get the firewood.
00:58:08.735,00:58:12.822,"Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't feel my toes!"
00:58:13.781,00:58:15.116,I don't have any toes!
00:58:16.117,00:58:17.660,I think I need a hug.
00:58:22.290,00:58:23.875,Mmm.
00:58:24.417,00:58:28.671,Mmm. This is good. This is really good.
00:58:30.465,00:58:32.759,"-What is this? -Uh, weedrat."
00:58:33.551,00:58:35.053,Rotisserie style.
00:58:35.345,00:58:36.513,No kidding.
00:58:38.097,00:58:39.474,"Well, this is delicious."
00:58:39.557,00:58:41.559,"Well, they're also great in stews."
00:58:41.768,00:58:46.314,"Now, I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean weedrat stew."
00:58:59.244,00:59:01.371,I'll cook all kinds of stuff for you.
00:59:01.496,00:59:04.541,"Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare, you name it."
00:59:18.972,00:59:21.599,"Um, Princess?"
00:59:22.642,00:59:25.144,"Yes, Shrek?"
00:59:25.687,00:59:28.648,"I, um, I was wondering."
00:59:29.607,00:59:30.900,Are you...
00:59:31.568,00:59:32.735,"Ah, ah..."
00:59:44.205,00:59:47.333,"Man, isn't this romantic? Just look at that sunset."
00:59:47.709,00:59:48.626,Sunset?
00:59:48.710,00:59:51.212,"Oh, no! I mean, it's late."
00:59:51.296,00:59:52.922,-I-- It's very late. -What?
00:59:53.006,00:59:55.800,Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on here.
00:59:56.467,00:59:59.053,"-You're afraid of the dark, aren't you? -Yes!"
00:59:59.304,01:00:02.849,"Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. You know, I'd better go inside."
01:00:02.932,01:00:08.980,"Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until-- Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark."
01:00:12.984,01:00:14.027,Good night.
01:00:19.157,01:00:21.576,Now I really see what's goin' on here.
01:00:21.659,01:00:23.536,"Oh, what are you talkin' about?"
01:00:23.620,01:00:26.039,"Hey, I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts."
01:00:26.122,01:00:28.416,And I know you two were diggin' on each other. I could feel it.
01:00:28.499,01:00:31.669,"Oh, you're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad."
01:00:32.211,01:00:35.173,"Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones."
01:00:35.423,01:00:51.648,"-Just go on in and tell her how you feel. -I-- There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that, well, you know-- and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause I don't-- she's a princess, and I'm-- An ogre?"
01:00:53.316,01:00:55.443,Yeah. An ogre.
01:00:56.152,01:00:59.989,"-Hey, where you goin'? -To get... more firewood."
01:01:19.092,01:01:20.134,Princess?
01:01:21.219,01:01:22.762,Princess Fiona?
01:01:28.226,01:01:29.894,"Princess, where are you?"
01:01:35.650,01:01:36.859,Princess?
01:01:41.698,01:01:44.617,It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing no games.
01:01:54.794,01:01:57.088,"-Aah! No, help! -Oh, no!"
01:01:57.171,01:01:58.798,-Shh! -Shrek! Shrek!
01:01:58.881,01:02:00.341,"-Shrek! -No, it's okay. It's okay."
01:02:00.466,01:02:02.969,"-What did you do with the princess? -Donkey, I'm the princess."
01:02:03.052,01:02:05.888,"-Aah! -It's me, in this body."
01:02:05.972,01:02:08.516,"Oh, my God! You ate the princess!"
01:02:08.599,01:02:10.435,-Can you hear me? -Donkey!
01:02:10.518,01:02:12.270,"-Listen, keep breathing! -No!"
01:02:12.353,01:02:13.187,I'll get you out of there!
01:02:13.396,01:02:15.815,-Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! -Shh.
01:02:15.898,01:02:17.692,-Shrek! -This is me.
01:02:23.197,01:02:24.365,Princess?
01:02:25.825,01:02:31.038,"What happened to you? You're, uh, uh, uh, different."
01:02:31.122,01:02:33.583,"-I'm ugly, okay? -Well, yeah!"
01:02:33.666,01:02:36.753,Was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea.
01:02:36.836,01:02:38.796,"-You are what you eat, I said. Now-- -No."
01:02:39.255,01:02:42.508,I-- I've been this way as long as I can remember.
01:02:42.592,01:02:45.303,"What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before."
01:02:45.553,01:02:48.264,It only happens when the sun goes down.
01:02:50.016,01:02:53.186,"By night one way, by day another."
01:02:53.728,01:02:55.480,This shall be the norm...
01:02:55.897,01:02:58.316,until you find true love's first kiss...
01:02:59.108,01:03:01.986,and then take love's true form.
01:03:04.155,01:03:07.033,"Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry."
01:03:07.116,01:03:08.493,It's a spell.
01:03:11.954,01:03:13.790,a witch cast a spell on me.
01:03:14.749,01:03:16.667,Every night I become this.
01:03:17.877,01:03:20.588,"This horrible, ugly beast!"
01:03:23.508,01:03:27.512,I was placed in a tower to await the day my true love would rescue me.
01:03:28.638,01:03:33.351,"That's why I have to marry Lord Farquaad tomorrow, before the sun sets and he sees me..."
01:03:39.023,01:03:41.901,"All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad."
01:03:42.109,01:03:45.738,"You're not that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly."
01:03:46.614,01:03:49.367,But you only look like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24-7.
01:03:49.575,01:03:55.581,"But, Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant to look."
01:03:56.833,01:04:00.461,"Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?"
01:04:00.711,01:04:02.004,I have to.
01:04:02.338,01:04:05.174,Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.
01:04:05.591,01:04:12.098,"But, you know, um, you're kind of an ogre, and Shrek-- well, you got a lot in common."
01:04:13.057,01:04:14.058,Shrek?
01:04:14.600,01:04:17.645,"Princess, I-- Uh, how's it going, first of all?"
01:04:18.229,01:04:20.940,"Good? Um, good for me too."
01:04:21.148,01:04:22.191,I'm okay.
01:04:22.441,01:04:32.451,"I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty and-- well, I don't really like it, but I thought you might like it 'cause you're pretty."
01:04:32.577,01:04:41.294,"But I like you anyway. I'd-- uh, uh-- I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go."
01:04:43.921,01:04:45.506,"Take a good look at me, Donkey."
01:04:46.382,01:04:50.803,"I mean, really, who could ever love a beast so hideous and ugly?"
01:04:51.053,01:04:53.306,Princess and ugly don't go together.
01:04:55.766,01:05:00.146,My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.
01:05:04.066,01:05:05.943,That's just how it has to be.
01:05:08.404,01:05:10.031,It's the only way to break the spell.
01:05:10.615,01:05:12.992,-You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth. -No!
01:05:13.075,01:05:16.078,You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know.
01:05:16.203,01:05:18.664,What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets?
01:05:18.748,01:05:21.083,Promise you won't tell. Promise!
01:05:21.167,01:05:23.878,"All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should."
01:05:25.046,01:05:27.798,"I just know before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy."
01:05:59.080,01:06:02.166,"I tell him, I tell him not."
01:06:03.167,01:06:04.251,I tell him.
01:06:05.169,01:06:06.087,Shrek!
01:06:06.879,01:06:31.862,"Shrek, there's something I want-- Shrek."
01:06:33.864,01:06:35.700,-Are you all right? -Perfect!
01:06:35.783,01:06:36.951,Never been better.
01:06:37.827,01:06:41.372,I-- I don't-- There's something I have to tell you.
01:06:41.455,01:06:43.749,"You don't have to tell me anything, Princess."
01:06:43.916,01:06:46.585,-I heard enough last night. -You heard what I said?
01:06:46.669,01:06:47.795,Every word.
01:06:48.587,01:06:51.507,"-I thought you'd understand. -Oh, I understand."
01:06:51.841,01:06:55.720,"Like you said, Who could love a hideous, ugly beast?"
01:06:56.929,01:06:58.764,But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.
01:06:58.848,01:07:00.599,"Yeah? Well, it does."
01:07:05.521,01:07:08.149,"Princess, I've brought you a little something."
01:07:20.661,01:07:22.455,Princess Fiona.
01:07:22.538,01:07:25.374,As promised. Now hand it over.
01:07:25.624,01:07:29.920,"Very well, ogre. The deed to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed."
01:07:30.296,01:07:33.883,Take it and go before I change my mind.
01:07:37.094,01:07:42.892,"but you startled me, for I have never seen such a radiant beauty before."
01:07:43.601,01:07:46.228,I am Lord Farquaad.
01:07:46.687,01:07:50.524,"Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no."
01:07:53.694,01:07:58.532,a short... farewell.
01:07:59.033,01:08:03.162,"Ah, that is so sweet. You don't have to waste good manners on the ogre."
01:08:06.290,01:08:09.418,"No, you're right. It doesn't."
01:08:09.919,01:08:13.839,"Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless Fiona."
01:08:17.134,01:08:21.097,Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?
01:08:26.018,01:08:33.734,"Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make-- Excellent! I'll start the plans, for tomorrow we wed!"
01:08:33.818,01:08:37.738,"No! I mean, uh, why wait?"
01:08:38.447,01:08:41.617,Let's get married today before the sun sets.
01:08:42.159,01:08:44.912,"Oh, anxious, are we? You're right."
01:08:45.121,01:08:47.706,"The sooner, the better. There's so much to do!"
01:08:48.874,01:08:51.168,"There's the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest list."
01:08:51.377,01:08:53.379,"Captain, round up some guests!"
01:08:57.466,01:08:59.552,"Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away."
01:08:59.718,01:09:01.053,Yeah? So what?
01:09:01.220,01:09:02.805,"Shrek, there's something about her you don't know."
01:09:02.930,01:09:09.395,"Look, I talked to her last night. She's-- I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya?"
01:09:09.728,01:09:13.315,"Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?"
01:09:13.399,01:09:15.276,"Shrek, I-- I wanna go with you."
01:09:15.359,01:09:18.070,"I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me."
01:09:18.195,01:09:22.408,I live alone! My swamp! Me! Nobody else!
01:09:22.491,01:09:24.368,Understand? Nobody!
01:09:24.577,01:09:29.165,"Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!"
01:09:29.456,01:09:32.418,-But I thought-- -Yeah. You know what?
01:09:32.751,01:09:34.295,You thought wrong!
01:09:36.630,01:09:37.673,Shrek.
01:11:59.315,01:12:00.274,Donkey?
01:12:03.360,01:12:06.363,"I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see one."
01:12:06.697,01:12:08.115,"Well, yeah."
01:12:08.324,01:12:11.744,"But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it."
01:12:11.827,01:12:14.788,"It is around your half. See, that's your half, and this is my half."
01:12:14.872,01:12:17.499,Oh! Your half. Hmm.
01:12:17.583,01:12:20.127,"Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess."
01:12:20.210,01:12:22.421,"I did half the work, I get half the booty."
01:12:22.504,01:12:24.965,"Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head."
01:12:26.050,01:12:28.344,"-Back off! -No, you back off."
01:12:28.427,01:12:30.637,-This is my swamp! -Our swamp.
01:12:30.721,01:12:32.056,"-Let go, Donkey! -You let go."
01:12:32.139,01:12:34.099,-Stubborn jackass! -Smelly ogre.
01:12:34.183,01:12:35.517,Fine!
01:12:36.643,01:12:38.479,"Hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet."
01:12:38.562,01:12:39.938,"Well, I'm through with you."
01:12:40.022,01:12:43.150,"Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, Me, me, me!"
01:12:43.442,01:12:46.028,"Well, guess what! Now it's my turn!"
01:12:46.111,01:12:48.238,So you just shut up and pay attention!
01:12:48.614,01:12:50.032,You are mean to me.
01:12:50.240,01:12:52.868,You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do!
01:12:53.160,01:12:55.829,You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.
01:12:55.913,01:12:59.750,"Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?"
01:13:00.250,01:13:03.462,Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!
01:13:03.545,01:13:06.507,"Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey."
01:13:06.757,01:13:09.843,I forgive you... for stabbin' me in the back!
01:13:11.345,01:13:16.392,"Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your own feelings."
01:13:16.475,01:13:20.104,"-Go away! -See! There you are, doing it again, just like you did to Fiona."
01:13:20.229,01:13:22.356,"All she ever do was like you, maybe even love you."
01:13:26.985,01:13:28.987,I heard the two of you talking.
01:13:29.113,01:13:30.114,She wasn't talkin' about you.
01:13:30.197,01:13:32.741,"She was talkin' about, uh, somebody else."
01:13:35.911,01:13:38.330,She wasn't talking about me?
01:13:38.997,01:13:40.749,"Well, then who was she talking about?"
01:13:40.833,01:13:43.544,"Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me."
01:13:43.627,01:13:45.671,-Right? Right? -Donkey!
01:13:45.754,01:13:48.298,"-No! -Okay, look."
01:13:48.549,01:13:50.384,"I'm sorry, all right?"
01:13:52.261,01:13:53.387,Hmph.
01:13:59.143,01:14:02.938,"I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly ogre."
01:14:04.398,01:14:05.732,Can you forgive me?
01:14:08.777,01:14:10.279,"Hey, that's what friends are for, right?"
01:14:10.821,01:14:12.990,Right. Friends?
01:14:13.615,01:14:14.575,Friends.
01:14:16.118,01:14:20.831,"So, um, what did Fiona say about me?"
01:14:21.206,01:14:23.792,What are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her?
01:14:24.543,01:14:27.004,The wedding! We'll never make it in time.
01:14:27.087,01:14:41.768,"Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where there's a will, there's a way, I guess it's just my animal magnetism."
01:14:45.272,01:14:47.774,"All right, all right. Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass."
01:14:47.858,01:14:50.402,"All right, hop on and hold on tight."
01:14:50.486,01:14:52.821,I haven't had a chance to install the seat belts yet.
01:15:25.145,01:15:37.574,"People of DuLoc, we gather here today, to bear witness, -to the union... -Um-- -...of our new king-- -Excuse me."
01:15:41.078,01:15:41.995,Go on.
01:15:47.668,01:15:50.712,"Go ahead, have some fun. If we need you, I'll whistle. How about that?"
01:15:53.882,01:15:55.759,"Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute!"
01:15:55.842,01:15:58.387,"-You wanna do this right, don't you? -What are you talking about?"
01:15:58.470,01:16:00.305,"There's a line, there's a line you gotta wait for."
01:16:00.389,01:16:02.516,"The preacher's gonna say, Speak now or forever hold your peace."
01:16:02.599,01:16:06.770,"-That's when you say, I object! -I don't have time for this!"
01:16:06.853,01:16:08.522,Wait. What are you doing? Listen to me!
01:16:08.605,01:16:10.274,"-Look, you love this woman, don't you? -Yes."
01:16:10.440,01:16:11.900,-You wanna hold her? -Yes.
01:16:11.984,01:16:13.318,-Please her? -Yes!
01:16:17.155,01:16:19.616,-The chicks love that romantic crap! -All right! Cut it out.
01:16:19.825,01:16:23.495,-When does this guy say the line? -We gotta check it out.
01:16:29.751,01:16:32.921,-I now pronounce you husband and wife-- -They're at the altar.
01:16:33.422,01:16:36.008,-King and queen... -Mother Fletcher! He already said it.
01:16:40.262,01:16:41.930,I object!
01:16:44.474,01:16:46.184,"Oh, now what does he want?"
01:16:49.771,01:16:52.774,"Hi, everyone. Havin' a good time, are ya?"
01:16:55.402,01:16:57.487,-Very clean. -What are you doing here?
01:16:57.571,01:17:03.660,"Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you, -but showing up uninvited to a wedding-- -Fiona!"
01:17:04.286,01:17:06.788,"-I need to talk to you. -Oh, now you wanna talk?"
01:17:07.289,01:17:12.711,"Well, It's a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me-- -But you can't marry him. -And why not?"
01:17:12.961,01:17:16.715,Because-- Because he's just marrying you so he can be king.
01:17:16.965,01:17:19.343,"Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him."
01:17:19.426,01:17:22.679,-He's not your true love. -And what do you know about true love?
01:17:22.763,01:17:28.769,"Well, I-- Uh-- -I mean-- -Oh, this is precious."
01:17:36.068,01:17:37.944,An ogre and a princess!
01:17:43.742,01:17:46.203,"Shrek, is this true?"
01:17:47.371,01:17:49.956,Who cares? It's preposterous!
01:17:50.123,01:17:53.710,"Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away from our happily ever after."
01:17:53.794,01:17:56.588,Now kiss me! Mmmm!
01:18:00.509,01:18:03.428,"By night one way, by day another."
01:18:06.181,01:18:07.724,I wanted to show you before.
01:18:31.748,01:18:35.585,"Well, uh, that explains a lot."
01:18:39.756,01:18:41.341,Guards! Guards!
01:18:41.425,01:18:44.970,I order you to get that out of my sight now! Get them!
01:18:45.053,01:18:47.013,"-Get them both! -No, no!"
01:18:47.097,01:18:48.932,This hocus-pocus alters nothing.
01:18:49.015,01:18:51.435,"This marriage is binding, and that makes me king!"
01:18:51.518,01:18:53.770,"-See? See? -No, let go of me! Shrek!"
01:18:53.854,01:18:54.688,No!
01:18:56.231,01:18:57.733,Get out of my way! Fiona!
01:19:01.236,01:19:02.571,Arrgh!
01:19:05.157,01:19:06.658,I'll see you drawn and quartered!
01:19:06.825,01:19:09.786,-You'll beg for death to save you! -No! Shrek!
01:19:09.870,01:19:12.748,"-And as for you, my wife, -Fiona!"
01:19:12.831,01:19:16.042,I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days!
01:19:18.086,01:19:25.302,I will have order! I will have perfection! I will have-- Aaah!
01:19:26.303,01:19:28.972,-Aah! All right. -Nobody move.
01:19:29.097,01:19:30.932,"I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to use it."
01:19:38.148,01:19:40.609,"Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they?"
01:19:43.987,01:19:45.238,"Go ahead, Shrek."
01:19:46.198,01:19:48.116,"Uh, Fiona?"
01:19:49.659,01:19:50.952,"Yes, Shrek?"
01:19:51.787,01:19:55.582,I-- I love you.
01:19:56.333,01:19:57.501,Really?
01:19:59.669,01:20:00.670,"Really, really."
01:20:02.631,01:20:04.341,I love you too.
01:20:53.223,01:20:54.349,Fiona?
01:20:57.978,01:20:58.895,Fiona.
01:21:00.313,01:21:01.773,Are you all right?
01:21:03.567,01:21:04.693,"Well, yes."
01:21:05.694,01:21:07.404,But I don't understand.
01:21:08.613,01:21:10.282,I'm supposed to be beautiful.
01:21:13.451,01:21:14.661,But you are beautiful.
01:21:17.664,01:21:19.708,I was hoping this would be a happy ending.
01:22:07.839,01:22:10.550,"God bless us, every one."
01:22:32.238,01:22:34.950,-Ooh! -Uh!
01:23:21.746,01:23:23.915,"Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh."
