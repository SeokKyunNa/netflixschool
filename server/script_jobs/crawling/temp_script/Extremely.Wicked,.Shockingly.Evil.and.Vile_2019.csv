00:01:37.722,00:01:39.682,Why did you bring me to a college bar?
00:01:40.308,00:01:41.392,I feel invisible here.
00:01:41.476,00:01:44.187,Because it's about time you get over that loser you were with.
00:01:44.312,00:01:48.024,No guy is gonna wanna go with a single mom who works as a secretary.
00:01:48.149,00:01:52.070,"Tonight, you are not a single mom, you are single."
00:01:52.153,00:01:55.698,"You're not a secretary, you have a secretary."
00:01:56.199,00:01:57.033,And...
00:01:57.117,00:02:00.829,how can you be invisible when that guy has been staring at you all night?
00:02:11.089,00:02:12.674,That's a beautiful ring.
00:02:16.469,00:02:18.263,"I didn't come to catch up, Ted."
00:02:28.148,00:02:29.607,This is my last quarter.
00:02:30.441,00:02:31.568,Better make it a good one.
00:02:36.072,00:02:37.824,I haven't seen you here before.
00:02:38.741,00:02:41.035,It's my first time out since I moved to Seattle.
00:02:41.661,00:02:43.163,Do you remember the night we met?
00:02:44.789,00:02:45.623,Yeah.
00:02:48.251,00:02:50.670,I fell in love with you the moment I saw you.
00:03:06.936,00:03:09.022,What do you say we get out of here?
00:03:09.230,00:03:10.690,"Well, I don't even know your name."
00:03:23.161,00:03:25.413,Thanks again for driving me home.
00:03:28.416,00:03:29.417,This is...
00:03:30.043,00:03:31.044,where I live.
00:03:31.169,00:03:32.212,Okay.
00:03:37.217,00:03:38.968,I guess I better get going.
00:03:42.680,00:03:45.391,"Sorry, it's late and I have school tomorrow."
00:03:46.059,00:03:47.727,"Ted, this is Rachel, my, uh..."
00:03:48.436,00:03:49.270,my sitter.
00:03:50.438,00:03:51.814,You can pay me later.
00:03:53.358,00:03:54.275,Bye.
00:03:56.736,00:03:58.571,I understand if you wanna go.
00:04:01.616,00:04:03.243,Why would I wanna... do that?
00:04:10.166,00:04:11.084,Come in.
00:04:25.348,00:04:27.100,Are you sure you don't want to run?
00:04:55.169,00:04:56.296,I'm really tired.
00:04:57.880,00:04:59.173,Do you wanna rest?
00:05:02.969,00:05:04.345,Come on. Let's rest.
00:05:43.259,00:05:44.218,Hi.
00:05:44.344,00:05:45.386,Coffee?
00:05:47.597,00:05:48.431,Okay.
00:05:51.351,00:05:52.185,Here you go.
00:05:56.689,00:05:57.690,Good morning.
00:05:59.650,00:06:01.194,You looked so pretty sleeping.
00:06:01.861,00:06:03.988,Just... I didn't wanna wake you.
00:06:07.241,00:06:08.076,Hey!
00:06:09.410,00:06:11.079,Want to tell Mom about breakfast?
00:06:12.622,00:06:14.916,I'm making omelettes. I found some bacon...
00:06:16.042,00:06:17.335,Do you like pancakes?
00:06:41.651,00:06:48.449,the King County area was engulfed in a wave of fear as young women were being attacked and murdered with alarming regularity.
00:06:48.533,00:06:52.412,Georgann Hawkins was last seen Monday evening shortly after midnight.
00:06:52.578,00:06:58.835,She had been visiting at the Beta house and was returning to her house just a half-block away down this alley.
00:07:02.547,00:07:06.426,after Janice Ott and Denise Naslund vanished from Lake Sammamish State Park.
00:07:06.509,00:07:15.059,At least seven people at the crowded beach saw a smooth-talking man with his arm in a cast asking several women to help him load a boat onto a Volkswagen.
00:07:19.939,00:07:23.609,and police have been flooded with phone calls from citizens who report seeing the suspect.
00:07:29.490,00:07:31.200,What kind of car did he drive?
00:08:07.445,00:08:12.950,"Hi, officer. I think I must be lost You ran two stop signs, son."
00:08:13.034,00:08:14.410,I know. I...
00:08:14.494,00:08:15.661,couldn't make your car.
00:08:15.745,00:08:19.790,"The headlights were in my eyes and, to be honest, I got a little bit spooked."
00:08:19.957,00:08:21.876,"-You got a license? -Yes, absolutely."
00:08:23.169,00:08:25.421,Somewhere... Yes. There..
00:08:27.840,00:08:31.761,"So what's a kid from Seattle doing in Granger, Utah this time of the morning?"
00:08:35.139,00:08:38.518,"I'm a law student over at, uh, the University of Utah."
00:08:38.809,00:08:40.436,My girlfriend lives in Seattle.
00:08:41.562,00:08:42.480,I'm actually...
00:08:43.147,00:08:45.316,gonna propose to her as soon as I graduate.
00:08:45.399,00:08:46.526,Trying to save for that ring.
00:08:46.651,00:08:50.863,"So if you can find it in your heart to let me off without a ticket, I would really appreciate it."
00:09:07.922,00:09:08.965,Hello!
00:09:10.132,00:09:10.967,Hello?
00:09:13.094,00:09:14.095,Stay here.
00:09:17.890,00:09:18.724,Hey.
00:09:20.268,00:09:22.937,Oh! What the f... was that for?
00:09:23.020,00:09:25.022,How many stop signs did you run?
00:09:35.324,00:09:37.493,Have you ever been to the town of Murray?
00:09:38.160,00:09:39.036,What?
00:09:39.453,00:09:41.539,"You don't actually believe this garbage, do you?"
00:09:41.622,00:09:43.291,"It's in all the papers, Ted!"
00:09:45.334,00:09:47.503,"If you don't stop screaming, I'm gonna kill you."
00:09:48.212,00:09:50.256,"Number seven, step forward."
00:09:52.300,00:09:54.760,"If you don't stop screaming, I'm gonna kill you."
00:09:56.429,00:09:59.348,"Now, miss. Do you recognize any of these suspects?"
00:10:06.147,00:10:10.484,You are hereby charged with aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault.
00:10:12.320,00:10:13.446,I got your bail reduced.
00:10:13.529,00:10:15.323,You'll be in Seattle with Liz tomorrow.
00:10:17.241,00:10:20.202,I didn't tell you 'cause I didn't want you to freak out.
00:10:21.120,00:10:21.996,Come here.
00:10:28.502,00:10:32.506,"I know it's hard being apart, but we only have four semesters between us..."
00:10:33.049,00:10:35.801,and our place in the Sound with a dog and a car.
00:10:38.387,00:10:40.097,Just like we always dreamed.
00:10:40.181,00:10:43.142,"-Ted! -Oh, monkey! Hey, what's up?"
00:10:51.901,00:10:53.069,I'm getting dizzy.
00:10:53.235,00:10:54.779,"Oh, come here! Gimme a hug."
00:10:54.945,00:10:57.239,Good to see you. I missed you. Mmm.
00:11:03.663,00:11:05.373,That is such a good idea!
00:11:05.456,00:11:07.541,I wish I could but I can't.
00:11:07.708,00:11:08.542,I'm sorry.
00:11:08.626,00:11:10.795,I have to pull an all-nighter tonight at the law library.
00:11:11.337,00:11:12.296,All-nighter?
00:11:12.546,00:11:16.676,"Yeah, I gotta make sure I'm the most prepared attorney in the courtroom once my trial starts."
00:11:18.219,00:11:20.179,Why did she pick you out of the lineup?
00:11:21.889,00:11:25.351,My lawyer found out that the police showed her my picture beforehand.
00:11:26.686,00:11:27.603,Twice.
00:11:28.604,00:11:29.897,Of course I looked familiar.
00:11:32.024,00:11:33.567,"That's not even the worst part, Liz."
00:11:35.361,00:11:38.489,What happened in Utah wasn't just dumb luck.
00:11:40.616,00:11:42.368,The police already had my name.
00:11:43.202,00:11:44.745,Someone gave it to them.
00:11:48.207,00:11:51.168,Someone gave your name to the authorities in Utah?
00:11:51.252,00:11:52.086,Mm-hmm.
00:11:52.586,00:11:54.505,Do you have any idea who'd do that to you?
00:11:58.050,00:11:59.885,"Look, do you see that car out there?"
00:12:02.012,00:12:04.098,It's been following me since I got back.
00:12:07.601,00:12:08.769,or I'm being set up.
00:12:12.273,00:12:13.107,Done!
00:12:13.274,00:12:14.316,It's a thresher shark.
00:12:14.400,00:12:16.610,They have a tail as long as their whole body.
00:12:16.861,00:12:19.447,A tail as long as their whole body? That's crazy!
00:12:20.156,00:12:21.574,How the heck did you get so smart?
00:12:21.657,00:12:23.200,I get it from my mom.
00:12:23.659,00:12:25.077,"You do, don't you?"
00:12:27.037,00:12:27.872,Aw.
00:12:31.792,00:12:33.377,Everything is gonna be okay.
00:14:01.257,00:14:02.466,"Uh, excuse me, sir."
00:14:02.550,00:14:04.176,"Could you come with me, please?"
00:14:05.344,00:14:06.512,Is there something wrong?
00:14:06.595,00:14:08.806,"Just come with me, please. Bring your coat."
00:14:10.349,00:14:11.308,Okay.
00:14:18.357,00:14:20.401,"You know this is ridiculous, right?"
00:14:20.484,00:14:21.569,We're closing soon anyway.
00:14:21.694,00:14:23.279,"So, it's just better for everybody."
00:14:23.362,00:14:24.989,"Oh, really? You're closing?"
00:14:26.031,00:14:27.366,You close in 45 minutes.
00:14:33.330,00:14:34.248,Hey!
00:14:35.165,00:14:36.166,"Hey, hey!"
00:14:36.750,00:14:37.668,Who are you?
00:14:37.751,00:14:38.836,"Hey, stop! Hey!"
00:14:38.919,00:14:40.296,I know you're following me!
00:14:40.421,00:14:42.214,What are you-- Who sent you?
00:14:56.645,00:14:57.730,What are you doing?
00:14:57.897,00:14:59.899,Reading. I'm prepping for the trial.
00:14:59.982,00:15:03.027,"-With a flashlight under the sheets? -Yeah, I didn't wanna wake you up."
00:15:08.157,00:15:09.158,You okay?
00:15:10.284,00:15:11.160,Uh...
00:15:11.994,00:15:13.203,I think we should get married.
00:15:25.549,00:15:27.676,Why is this happening right now?
00:15:27.760,00:15:32.264,A couple of college girls disappeared last year around the University of Washington.
00:15:32.348,00:15:38.187,"And two more girls vanished in broad daylight in a crowded state park in, uh..."
00:15:38.854,00:15:40.481,near Seattle. You remember that?
00:15:41.106,00:15:42.566,-Lake... Lake Sammamish? -Yeah.
00:15:42.942,00:15:45.861,"Witnesses say some guy was asking girls to, uh..."
00:15:46.070,00:15:49.114,"help him put a sailboat on top of a car, and police put out a sketch."
00:15:49.239,00:15:51.575,"I had the same car as the suspect, a VW Bug..."
00:15:51.659,00:15:54.620,and my friends teased me about the resemblance to the sketch.
00:15:55.162,00:15:57.039,"But, geez, nobody was serious."
00:15:57.122,00:15:58.290,Someone must have been.
00:15:58.457,00:16:01.835,Because your name landed on a suspect list in Seattle.
00:16:02.753,00:16:04.880,When Utah police got wind of that...
00:16:04.964,00:16:09.843,"they started looking at you with a lot more interest, because something similar is happening to the girls right here."
00:16:10.928,00:16:13.055,I was kicking him and screaming.
00:16:13.681,00:16:20.688,"He held a small black gun to my head and said, If you don't stop screaming I'm going to kill you."
00:16:20.854,00:16:22.481,I'll blow your brains out.
00:16:22.648,00:16:26.068,Then I fell backwards out of his car and ran as fast as I could.
00:16:26.485,00:16:28.487,"As best you recall, Carol..."
00:16:29.154,00:16:31.991,is the man who approached you present in court today?
00:16:33.659,00:16:34.743,Mm-hmm.
00:16:34.994,00:16:35.828,Yes.
00:16:36.453,00:16:38.330,Can you point where he's seated?
00:16:45.546,00:16:48.841,Let the record state the identification of the defendant.
00:16:54.346,00:16:56.056,"No more questions, Your Honor."
00:16:56.557,00:16:57.725,"Hi, Miss Daronch."
00:16:58.392,00:17:04.064,Had the police shown you a picture of my client prior to your identification of him at the October 2nd lineup?
00:17:06.358,00:17:17.953,"You did in fact pick his picture out of a pile but when asked specifically why you chose his picture, you stated It looks something like him, but I really couldn't say for sure."
00:17:18.537,00:17:19.621,Is that correct?
00:17:21.373,00:17:22.332,Mm-hmm.
00:17:22.833,00:17:27.046,The only remotely corroborative evidence you provided was a make of a vehicle.
00:17:27.129,00:17:30.382,"It's a Volkswagen, one of the most popular cars in America."
00:17:30.591,00:17:34.136,Yet his Volkswagen looks nothing like your description.
00:17:34.219,00:17:35.429,How do you square that?
00:17:38.974,00:17:40.809,"Hmm. I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you."
00:17:42.978,00:17:45.064,They told me it was supposed to be the car.
00:17:45.856,00:17:46.815,Who did?
00:17:47.316,00:17:48.650,"Who told you that, Miss Daronch?"
00:17:54.823,00:17:56.909,We all sympathize with your pain.
00:17:56.992,00:17:59.078,It is horrible what you went through.
00:17:59.161,00:18:04.958,"But the fact of the matter is you identified my client because law enforcement wanted you to, didn't you?"
00:18:08.962,00:18:11.048,"No. No further questions, Your Honor."
00:18:21.183,00:18:23.102,but you sure you want to do this right now?
00:18:24.937,00:18:26.688,doesn't mean we can't look for the dog.
00:18:26.814,00:18:28.190,-Right? -Mm-hmm. Okay.
00:18:30.234,00:18:31.110,Carole Ann?
00:18:31.193,00:18:32.027,Ah!
00:18:32.444,00:18:35.280,"- Hi, stranger. - Oh, my God. Hi. Wow."
00:18:37.199,00:18:38.992,What are you-- What are you doing here?
00:18:39.284,00:18:40.327,Do you live in Utah now?
00:18:40.494,00:18:44.081,No. I'm just visiting some friends that work here.
00:18:44.748,00:18:46.375,-Great. -Hi.
00:18:47.334,00:18:48.418,I'm Liz.
00:18:48.502,00:18:49.586,"Yes, this is..."
00:18:50.546,00:18:53.757,my girlfriend. We just got engaged so...
00:18:54.758,00:19:00.389,Carole Ann and I used to work together at the Department of Emergency Services in Olympia years ago.
00:19:00.472,00:19:01.640,"Oh, that's nice."
00:19:02.474,00:19:03.642,"Ted, I heard..."
00:19:04.017,00:19:05.853,"Everything is gonna be okay, you know?"
00:19:06.186,00:19:08.564,We're all behind you. One hundred percent.
00:19:08.856,00:19:11.108,Whoever this woman is who's accusing you...
00:19:11.733,00:19:14.820,I'm sure she's just gotten you mixed up with another handsome stranger.
00:19:15.737,00:19:16.613,Right.
00:19:16.697,00:19:19.032,"Well, I'm gonna take this handsome stranger..."
00:19:19.116,00:19:21.493,"and, yeah, it was nice to meet you, Carole Ann."
00:19:21.577,00:19:23.662,-It's good to see you. -Bye.
00:19:25.914,00:19:27.291,What's her story?
00:19:29.334,00:19:31.253,We're just old friends.
00:19:32.296,00:19:33.797,Haven't seen her in a long time.
00:19:40.304,00:19:41.930,Check this guy out.
00:19:42.139,00:19:44.391,He looks like he'd be a good roommate.
00:19:46.935,00:19:47.936,Come here.
00:19:53.233,00:19:55.027,"Promise you'll never leave me, Liz."
00:19:56.653,00:19:59.156,'Cause I honestly don't know what I'd do without you.
00:20:00.490,00:20:01.700,I would never.
00:20:15.923,00:20:16.924,He's so sweet.
00:20:17.674,00:20:18.717,Look at him.
00:20:41.031,00:20:42.908,"We're gonna get a dog one day, don't worry."
00:20:43.200,00:20:44.076,What will it be like?
00:20:45.452,00:20:47.246,You're so weird.
00:20:50.666,00:20:53.877,"That makes you weird, just by association."
00:20:56.255,00:20:57.464,I don't want to listen to this.
00:21:20.279,00:21:21.196,Oh!
00:21:58.442,00:22:01.570,By the power vested in me as both judge and jury...
00:22:01.945,00:22:07.909,I hereby find the defendant guilty of aggravated kidnapping beyond a reasonable doubt.
00:22:09.202,00:22:12.456,You will be remanded to the Utah State Prison to await sentencing.
00:22:12.914,00:22:14.708,-This court is adjourned. -Ted!
00:22:19.129,00:22:20.380,Everything's gonna be fine.
00:22:20.464,00:22:22.049,"Listen, everything's gonna be fine, all right?"
00:22:22.132,00:22:24.176,"-I'm sorry. -Just don't give up on me, all right?"
00:22:24.259,00:22:25.719,-I won't. -I'm gonna fix this.
00:22:25.802,00:22:26.678,I'm sorry.
00:23:24.986,00:23:26.988,"No, no, it's not scary. It's, uh..."
00:23:27.739,00:23:31.952,Let's just say that men convicted of crimes against women have a short shelf life in here.
00:23:32.536,00:23:34.079,"Uh, listen, Liz."
00:23:34.371,00:23:36.123,This whole thing is gonna be overturned.
00:23:37.165,00:23:40.502,Okay? I've already filed an appeal and I've been working on it day and night.
00:23:40.585,00:23:45.382,I'm gonna be out of here as soon-- Everything is gonna be okay.
00:23:46.091,00:23:47.592,I wanna come see you.
00:23:53.473,00:23:55.559,I was really hoping you'd say that.
00:24:05.819,00:24:07.320,University Medical Division.
00:24:08.947,00:24:09.906,Please hold.
00:24:11.741,00:24:13.285,"Liz, you have a call on line two."
00:24:15.829,00:24:18.206,"University Medical Division, this is Liz."
00:24:18.331,00:24:20.709,"Hi, Liz. This is Detective Mike Fisher."
00:24:21.251,00:24:22.502,Do you have a moment?
00:24:23.420,00:24:24.504,About what?
00:24:24.754,00:24:26.548,I think you know what it's about.
00:24:43.732,00:24:45.150,Mind if I join you here?
00:24:53.617,00:24:54.576,Whatcha doing?
00:24:55.285,00:24:57.913,Indexing 700 pages of testimony.
00:25:00.040,00:25:01.166,Sounds fun.
00:25:02.042,00:25:03.627,Not when it's about you.
00:25:04.628,00:25:05.795,What's your game?
00:25:06.338,00:25:07.464,I'm kind of busy.
00:25:11.009,00:25:12.344,Seattle authorities.
00:25:12.636,00:25:15.597,"Well, I don't work for King County. I work for Pitkin County."
00:25:15.972,00:25:17.807,-Where is that? -Colorado.
00:25:17.933,00:25:18.808,Colorado?
00:25:20.352,00:25:21.937,"Ever been to Colorado, Ted?"
00:25:22.854,00:25:24.439,"Mister, I'm a full-time law student."
00:25:24.523,00:25:26.441,I barely have time to set foot off campus.
00:25:28.443,00:25:29.444,Is that a no?
00:25:32.405,00:25:34.449,Let me get back to plotting my escape here.
00:25:41.164,00:25:41.998,You were.
00:25:44.125,00:25:47.337,-I'm sorry? -You were a full-time law student.
00:25:47.462,00:25:50.382,"For the record, my game..."
00:25:50.632,00:25:51.466,is homicide.
00:25:53.468,00:25:54.511,Catch you later.
00:25:55.303,00:25:57.347,"-I'm sorry. -We could really use your help, Liz."
00:25:57.430,00:25:59.224,There is nothing I can help you with.
00:26:01.351,00:26:02.936,And please don't call me here anymore.
00:26:16.825,00:26:17.951,"John, hey."
00:26:18.118,00:26:19.452,Give me some good news.
00:26:19.536,00:26:20.412,The appeal go through?
00:26:20.495,00:26:22.122,I thought I told you not to talk to anyone.
00:26:22.205,00:26:23.748,Yeah. Yeah. I didn't.
00:26:23.832,00:26:27.919,You didn't tell a homicide detective that you'd never been to Colorado?
00:26:28.461,00:26:29.588,He had your gas slips.
00:26:29.671,00:26:31.548,He knew you were gonna lie. He was baiting you.
00:26:31.631,00:26:33.425,He's extraditing you for murder.
00:26:33.717,00:26:35.051,But I... I didn't lie!
00:26:35.135,00:26:36.386,You've never been to Colorado?
00:26:36.469,00:26:37.929,"Yes, I've been to Colorado."
00:26:38.013,00:26:39.514,I've been to Colorado tons of times.
00:26:39.598,00:26:42.726,I'm an avid skier. I was just with Liz in Colorado.
00:26:42.809,00:26:43.810,This is outrageous.
00:26:43.893,00:26:45.687,Since when is it a crime to go to Colorado?
00:26:45.770,00:26:54.195,Since homicide detectives in surrounding states started looking for commonalities in their open cases and found ways to make you fit.
00:26:54.696,00:26:56.197,You have to stop this.
00:26:56.531,00:26:59.868,They are railroading me-- I'm not licensed in Colorado.
00:26:59.951,00:27:02.621,There are some good attorneys that I can give you the names of.
00:27:02.704,00:27:04.456,"-They're awfully expensive-- -John, please."
00:27:04.539,00:27:07.042,"Otherwise, they're gonna provide you with a public defender."
00:27:07.125,00:27:08.835,"-No, no. John, please. -Good luck to you."
00:27:08.918,00:27:09.878,"No, John, hey!"
00:27:13.089,00:27:14.007,John!
00:27:42.327,00:27:43.203,Bad day?
00:27:44.996,00:27:46.456,Ted's been sent to Colorado.
00:27:50.919,00:27:52.545,I thought he was being held in Utah.
00:27:56.341,00:27:58.176,"It's about another missing girl, isn't it?"
00:28:00.136,00:28:01.304,"It's a mistake, Jo."
00:28:03.765,00:28:10.105,The news said King County is looking at him in connection to the two girls that disappeared from Lake Sammamish that one summer.
00:28:10.689,00:28:12.565,You remember that sketch that we saw?
00:28:12.649,00:28:14.150,It looked just like him.
00:28:16.444,00:28:18.196,That sketch looked like everybody.
00:28:18.905,00:28:20.782,"Well, his name is on the suspect list."
00:28:20.907,00:28:23.243,"There were over 30,000 names at one point."
00:28:23.326,00:28:25.537,Every brown-haired guy with a Volkswagen Bug.
00:28:27.122,00:28:28.498,It's a mistake.
00:28:28.581,00:28:29.833,The police said he was cleared.
00:28:29.916,00:28:31.251,How do you even know that?
00:28:33.044,00:28:34.295,And why is he in jail?
00:28:34.921,00:28:37.632,And how did his name get on that suspect list?
00:28:37.716,00:28:38.925,I think you should leave.
00:28:42.554,00:28:43.805,I think you should leave.
00:28:44.139,00:28:44.973,Okay.
00:29:11.833,00:29:12.709,Where?
00:29:12.792,00:29:15.253,I'm sitting in an office at the Aspen Courthouse.
00:29:16.421,00:29:17.672,Can you hear my chains jangling?
00:29:18.173,00:29:19.299,"No, I can't."
00:29:19.591,00:29:21.968,You know why? 'Cause I'm not wearing any.
00:29:22.469,00:29:27.265,"I convinced a judge to make me co-counsel, so I have all the benefits of, like, a regular lawyer."
00:29:27.849,00:29:29.559,I get to use the library as much as I want.
00:29:29.642,00:29:31.269,I get a big desk.
00:29:31.352,00:29:34.397,They gave me a typewriter and uncensored use of the phone.
00:29:34.731,00:29:36.608,So I called you to see how you're doing.
00:29:36.691,00:29:39.736,All the other prisoners just think that I'm some big-wig or something.
00:29:39.819,00:29:41.029,Can we talk later?
00:29:42.363,00:29:43.990,I have a headache and I have to work.
00:29:44.073,00:29:45.658,"Yeah, but hold on one sec. Liz."
00:29:46.075,00:29:46.910,"Liz. Liz, Liz."
00:29:57.170,00:29:59.255,"University Medical Division, this is Liz."
00:29:59.339,00:30:02.008,"Hey, I want to tell you about this book. Have you ever heard of Papillon?"
00:30:02.091,00:30:02.967,A book?
00:30:03.051,00:30:11.476,"Yeah, it's about this guy who's wrongfully convicted of a terrible, terrible crime and get sentenced to life, but he didn't do it and, uh-- Goodbye, Ted."
00:30:12.060,00:30:12.977,"Wait, Liz!"
00:30:17.023,00:30:18.942,"-What? -Please, please, please, don't hang up."
00:30:19.025,00:30:21.319,He obsesses over the day that he'll be free again.
00:30:21.402,00:30:26.407,"He spends years hatching escapes, getting caught, punished, beaten, betrayed..."
00:30:26.866,00:30:28.243,but he never loses hope.
00:30:29.244,00:30:30.703,"And that's my wish for us, Liz."
00:30:31.496,00:30:33.623,That we never lose hope.
00:30:34.499,00:30:35.792,Does he make it out?
00:30:36.209,00:30:38.002,"Well, I'm not gonna give away the ending."
00:30:39.379,00:30:40.380,Call me tonight.
00:30:40.505,00:30:42.173,"Okay, I'll call you tonight."
00:30:45.051,00:30:46.094,Off the ledge.
00:30:48.721,00:30:49.597,Sure.
00:30:56.312,00:31:01.150,for the murder of Caryn Campbell who disappeared from a well-lit hallway at the Wildwood Inn in Aspen.
00:31:01.276,00:31:05.363,"A month later, her nude body was found in a snowbank several miles away."
00:31:10.743,00:31:17.292,"As a pre-trial, we are not here to consider the credibility of the evidence, only its existence."
00:31:18.293,00:31:28.094,"And after careful consideration, this court rules in favor of the defendant standing trial for the murder of Caryn Campbell."
00:31:30.471,00:31:35.727,"Your Honor, the state also seeks a hearing to consider the death penalty, should the trial come to that phase."
00:31:35.810,00:31:37.604,We will determine that in a later date.
00:31:37.937,00:31:41.399,"For now, the defendant shall be held without bail."
00:31:41.482,00:31:42.609,This court is adjourned.
00:31:46.738,00:31:49.657,-The death penalty? -It's... just a formality.
00:31:51.951,00:31:54.287,Their case is circumstantial at best.
00:31:55.079,00:31:56.873,It's a... slam dunk.
00:31:57.040,00:31:57.916,That's funny.
00:31:58.041,00:31:59.834,My last lawyer said the same thing.
00:32:26.402,00:32:27.779,"I can't do another trial, Ted."
00:32:27.904,00:32:29.072,You have to come.
00:32:30.323,00:32:31.824,"Liz, you have to come."
00:32:33.618,00:32:35.620,"Liz, promise me that you'll come."
00:32:36.079,00:32:37.080,Liz?
00:32:38.456,00:32:39.290,Liz!
00:32:40.541,00:32:41.376,Liz!
00:33:18.037,00:33:20.665,standing trial for murder here in Colorado.
00:33:21.249,00:33:27.338,"You've also been convicted in Utah of attempted kidnapping, yet you adamantly maintain your innocence."
00:33:27.755,00:33:29.007,Does this make you angry?
00:33:30.550,00:33:32.218,"Uh, sure. Sure. I get..."
00:33:32.844,00:33:35.304,I get angry. And indignant.
00:33:38.433,00:33:43.187,"I mean, does that include the time that I stole a comic book when I was five years old?"
00:33:44.230,00:33:45.440,I'm not guilty.
00:33:46.065,00:33:51.070,I am comfortable with my blanket statement that I am innocent.
00:33:51.154,00:33:55.283,Do you think the police have done a bad job because you're an innocent guy here sitting in prison?
00:33:55.408,00:34:00.913,As long as the police keep their heads in the sand about me...
00:34:01.122,00:34:08.713,then people are going to continue showing up dead or missing from the canyons in Colorado to the Salt Lake Valley.
00:34:09.255,00:34:10.214,Um...
00:34:10.339,00:34:17.013,and young women are going to continue to be threatened by that person or persons.
00:34:23.561,00:34:24.479,Legally?
00:34:25.229,00:34:26.064,Sure.
00:34:30.651,00:34:33.613,in this pre-trial sentencing consideration?
00:34:34.155,00:34:42.705,"Your Honor, the defense request that the court exclude the death penalty on the grounds that seeking it is often arbitrary and capricious."
00:34:43.539,00:34:46.918,"The court will consider your arguments, Mr. Dumas."
00:34:47.418,00:34:52.006,Let's take a fifteen-minute recess before concluding with the prosecution's final arguments.
00:34:53.049,00:34:54.634,Come on. Let's get some air.
00:34:57.053,00:34:58.096,"Oh, you know what?"
00:34:59.222,00:35:00.431,I need to make a phone call.
00:35:00.515,00:35:01.557,I need to call Liz.
00:35:03.601,00:35:05.019,"Excuse me, Deputy?"
00:35:05.478,00:35:07.688,He needs to use the phone in the library.
00:35:08.314,00:35:09.899,"-All right, make it short. -Thank you."
00:35:11.692,00:35:12.652,Be right back.
00:35:32.421,00:35:33.256,Hey!
00:35:37.301,00:35:39.762,"Uh, things are really..."
00:35:40.429,00:35:41.472,So...
00:35:41.722,00:35:45.143,you came all the way from Ohio just for this little trial?
00:35:45.268,00:35:48.354,"Listen, I really just called to tell you how much I miss you."
00:35:50.273,00:35:52.191,This is just a regular day for me.
00:35:52.275,00:35:56.195,Just the other day I was walking down Main Street I heard the screaming from this record store.
00:35:56.279,00:35:58.281,There was this kid with a record running right at me.
00:35:58.364,00:36:02.076,"So I unholstered my service weapon, making like I was about to discharge."
00:36:02.160,00:36:03.077,"Oh, that means shoot."
00:36:41.532,00:36:42.867,Just give me one minute.
00:36:53.085,00:36:53.961,"Oh, shit!"
00:37:10.686,00:37:11.562,He went that way.
00:37:11.646,00:37:14.190,The subject has been spotted running northeast of the court!
00:37:46.931,00:37:49.225,"I have no idea, Your Honor."
00:37:49.767,00:37:51.936,They don't teach you this in law school.
00:37:55.147,00:37:57.316,and a bench warrant has been issued for his arrest.
00:37:58.526,00:38:00.069,I guess we're adjourned.
00:38:17.295,00:38:20.381,saw someone jump out of those windows in Aspen's Courthouse.
00:38:20.506,00:38:26.929,He walked downstairs in the courthouse and asked the Sheriff's secretary if it was normal for somebody to be leaping out of those windows.
00:38:28.556,00:38:31.392,"Liz, this is crazy. He will never come here."
00:38:32.351,00:38:35.313,The cops are probably on a round-the-clock stakeout.
00:38:36.939,00:38:37.857,I need a drink.
00:38:38.232,00:38:39.400,You already had one.
00:38:39.692,00:38:42.486,Since when is it a crime to take the edge off every once in a while?
00:38:42.987,00:38:45.948,Since your little girl started asking why her mommy is so sad.
00:38:46.365,00:38:48.034,And it's not just once in a while.
00:38:48.326,00:38:51.329,So don't soft-pedal this and make me out to be the bad guy.
00:38:51.662,00:38:52.747,You do this every day.
00:38:52.830,00:38:55.791,"You read those letters from Ted, you drink, you cry..."
00:38:55.875,00:38:57.001,I take care of myself.
00:38:57.084,00:38:58.127,I'm a good mother.
00:38:58.210,00:39:02.423,"You are a great mother, but you are in denial."
00:39:04.467,00:39:05.885,What is it about this guy?
00:39:15.478,00:39:16.771,When I feel his love...
00:39:18.939,00:39:20.941,I feel like I'm on top of the world.
00:39:21.734,00:39:24.695,"And when I don't, I feel like I'm nothing."
00:39:27.239,00:39:30.368,What if the only thing he's guilty of is running a stop sign?
00:39:32.036,00:39:35.456,He's been convicted of attempted abduction in Utah...
00:39:35.998,00:39:43.005,"accused of murder in Colorado, his name is being tossed around in connection to other murders in other states. Liz..."
00:39:45.257,00:39:47.802,You know this didn't start with a stop sign.
00:39:51.764,00:39:55.476,after spending nearly six days of freedom in the mountains near Aspen.
00:39:56.310,00:40:02.358,This morning he was returned to court and arraigned on numerous additional charges relating to his escape.
00:40:19.583,00:40:20.501,"Thanks, guys."
00:40:22.711,00:40:24.088,"Oh, my gosh."
00:40:26.715,00:40:27.591,Mmm.
00:40:30.428,00:40:31.554,"So, what do you think?"
00:40:36.475,00:40:37.852,"Outside, fresh air..."
00:40:37.935,00:40:38.769,Fancy.
00:40:44.608,00:40:45.776,Merry Christmas.
00:40:49.238,00:40:50.573,I didn't get you anything.
00:40:51.115,00:40:54.160,You brought me the only thing I wanted in the entire world.
00:40:57.455,00:40:58.414,Gonna open it?
00:40:59.957,00:41:00.875,Yeah.
00:41:06.922,00:41:08.299,I've read it four times.
00:41:10.050,00:41:12.261,"You remember what it's about, don't you?"
00:41:13.095,00:41:14.472,Never lose hope.
00:41:15.347,00:41:16.265,You haven't...
00:41:17.391,00:41:18.434,have you?
00:41:21.437,00:41:22.980,I know this is hard.
00:41:24.899,00:41:27.359,"Believe me, it's hard for me too."
00:41:27.568,00:41:28.694,It's so hard.
00:41:29.028,00:41:31.572,And running was foolish of me.
00:41:32.948,00:41:34.992,But you weren't answering my calls.
00:41:38.746,00:41:40.956,I didn't know what to do. I thought I was...
00:41:41.457,00:41:42.500,going to lose you.
00:41:42.750,00:41:44.585,-I got scared. -Your lawyer called...
00:41:46.045,00:41:48.297,and he said the Utah appeal was rejected.
00:41:54.553,00:41:57.264,I'm going to take this all the way to the Supreme Court.
00:41:57.348,00:41:58.974,They're not giving you probation.
00:41:59.058,00:42:00.392,They're giving you 15 years.
00:42:00.476,00:42:01.477,That's a maximum.
00:42:01.560,00:42:02.645,"That's a maximum, okay?"
00:42:02.728,00:42:04.855,No one gets a max on their first conviction.
00:42:04.939,00:42:06.857,And you're facing 90 more for running.
00:42:06.941,00:42:08.901,"I have this under control, Liz."
00:42:08.984,00:42:11.737,I have it figured out. It's all up here.
00:42:11.946,00:42:13.989,"-Okay? -I can't do this anymore, Ted."
00:42:14.114,00:42:16.200,"What are-- What are you talking about, Liz?"
00:42:16.283,00:42:18.452,"Liz, look at me. Liz! Liz, look at me."
00:42:19.537,00:42:20.955,Do you not love me anymore?
00:42:23.999,00:42:25.000,"No, I do."
00:42:26.877,00:42:28.837,I do and that's the problem.
00:42:31.131,00:42:32.174,What if I get out?
00:42:32.758,00:42:35.052,I can get out of here. I know I can.
00:42:35.135,00:42:37.304,And we could go away. We can go away to Canada.
00:42:37.930,00:42:39.431,We can do whatever we wanna do.
00:42:39.515,00:42:42.685,"I promise, it would be-- We'd be free. It would be fine."
00:42:43.936,00:42:46.021,-This is from Molly. -What?
00:42:46.105,00:42:47.398,"No, Liz. Please, don't go!"
00:42:48.941,00:42:50.276,Come on. Liz!
00:43:53.005,00:43:53.839,Hey.
00:43:54.465,00:43:55.424,Hey.
00:43:57.760,00:43:59.303,"So, what's your resolution?"
00:44:01.055,00:44:02.097,For New Year's.
00:44:04.433,00:44:06.810,Mine's to lose a couple of belt notches.
00:44:07.102,00:44:09.688,Although I always manage to find them later.
00:44:13.567,00:44:14.902,I don't really have one.
00:44:15.319,00:44:16.195,"Aw, come on."
00:44:16.945,00:44:18.781,Everybody got something they want.
00:44:19.448,00:44:21.033,Something they want to get rid of.
00:44:22.242,00:44:24.328,What if you don't know which one it is?
00:44:27.956,00:44:30.167,There are many things I can live without...
00:44:32.336,00:44:33.796,but you are not one of them.
00:44:43.263,00:44:45.683,"So, you going anywhere for the holidays?"
00:44:47.434,00:44:48.352,Um...
00:44:48.435,00:44:52.398,"No, I think Molly and I will just stay here, do things at home."
00:44:52.481,00:44:53.357,That's nice.
00:44:54.024,00:44:56.568,"What about you? Any, uh, big plans?"
00:44:59.613,00:45:03.200,"I was gonna make something up, but-- Planning to sleep..."
00:45:04.243,00:45:05.536,sleep through the holidays.
00:45:11.250,00:45:12.626,"Hey, this isn't working."
00:45:46.118,00:45:47.077,How's your sandwich?
00:45:48.620,00:45:49.788,Same as yesterday.
00:45:55.919,00:45:56.837,No.
00:45:57.254,00:45:58.213,I didn't think so.
00:46:36.794,00:46:42.049,"is on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list, he has successfully eluded both police dogs and road blocks."
00:46:42.508,00:46:44.384,One of the first victims he was suspected of killing...
00:46:45.469,00:46:53.685,"...was Lynda Ann Healy, a 21-year-old University of Washington Student, who disappeared from her Seattle apartment in January of 1974."
00:46:55.521,00:46:58.816,"Evening, ma'am. Sorry to bother you. I'm Detective Mike Fisher."
00:46:59.149,00:47:00.400,Talked to you on the phone.
00:47:02.778,00:47:06.782,"Pitkin County, Colorado -Mind if I come in? -I'm good right here."
00:47:07.658,00:47:10.953,"Okay, well, I'm assuming that you know that Ted escaped."
00:47:11.161,00:47:12.621,"Well, it's all over the news."
00:47:12.788,00:47:17.501,I can't stress enough how important it is that you notify me if he contacts you.
00:47:18.168,00:47:24.508,"if you do know something that you're not telling me, you would be guilty of aiding and abetting."
00:47:25.008,00:47:27.511,You came all the way from Colorado to tell me that?
00:47:28.303,00:47:32.558,I thought that you should see firsthand just how serious this is.
00:47:35.769,00:47:38.730,"You help us to get him, you can prevent it from happening again."
00:47:38.897,00:47:41.608,"Whatever you think you know about him, it's all a lie."
00:47:41.733,00:47:50.450,"Ma'am, there are things you don't know, I can't tell you right now, that will shock you beyond your worst nightmares."
00:47:51.285,00:47:53.912,It's only a matter of time before the cards are on the table.
00:47:53.996,00:47:55.622,"And when they are, they will rock you."
00:47:56.081,00:47:56.915,Is that it?
00:47:57.457,00:48:00.460,"Sooner or later, you're going to have to confront the truth."
00:48:03.964,00:48:05.299,For everyone's sake.
00:48:06.174,00:48:07.134,Including yours.
00:48:07.801,00:48:09.845,I hope it's soon. Good night.
00:48:22.608,00:48:26.570,With all these transfers and stuff it's taking a little longer than I expected.
00:48:26.653,00:48:28.363,-Are you guys in a sorority? -Yeah.
00:48:28.447,00:48:29.406,I knew it.
00:48:40.042,00:48:48.050,walked to class in groups today while detectives tried to track a man who slipped into a sorority house early yesterday and murdered two women.
00:48:51.845,00:48:54.556,Police say he was armed with a heavy oak log.
00:48:54.640,00:49:00.312,He clubbed and then strangled to death 20-year-old Lisa Levy and 21-year-old Margaret Bowman.
00:49:00.395,00:49:02.314,At least one of them was raped.
00:49:02.397,00:49:08.862,Then he brutally beat three more sleeping coeds and then struck again six blocks away nearly killing another young woman.
00:49:09.237,00:49:17.621,The killer came in from the night and then returned to it with an ease that has so far baffled police and left most coeds here terrified.
00:49:18.497,00:49:21.291,What kind of a person do you think is at large?
00:49:22.376,00:49:23.460,Well...
00:49:23.752,00:49:29.549,"I'd rather say we've got a very disturbed, sick individual."
00:49:50.237,00:49:52.364,Shit! Shit! Shit!
00:49:52.698,00:49:53.907,Shit!
00:50:03.166,00:50:04.292,"Evening, officer."
00:50:05.377,00:50:07.045,"Sorry, I couldn't make out your headlights."
00:50:07.129,00:50:09.214,And I think I just got a little bit spooked.
00:50:09.297,00:50:11.383,"Can I see your license and registration, please?"
00:50:11.466,00:50:13.260,"Absolutely. Yes, of course."
00:50:15.345,00:50:16.388,Got it right here.
00:50:27.816,00:50:28.775,Stop!
00:50:28.984,00:50:30.318,Stop or I'll shoot!
00:50:34.614,00:50:35.532,...a ten?
00:50:36.199,00:50:37.951,Hmm... go fish.
00:50:38.035,00:50:39.161,Oh. Well...
00:50:47.335,00:50:48.253,Hello.
00:50:50.839,00:50:52.132,I'm in custody.
00:50:53.258,00:50:55.135,I made a deal with the police.
00:50:55.260,00:50:58.263,They wouldn't announce my arrest until I could call you first.
00:50:58.430,00:50:59.723,They didn't know who I was.
00:50:59.806,00:51:02.142,I finally gave them my name for this phone call.
00:51:03.643,00:51:05.645,It's gonna be bad when it breaks loose.
00:51:06.104,00:51:07.064,Real bad.
00:51:08.356,00:51:10.400,I did not do these things.
00:51:10.484,00:51:11.651,I'm innocent.
00:51:25.040,00:51:26.166,You're my lawyer?
00:51:27.000,00:51:29.002,"That's funny, I thought you were one."
00:51:36.218,00:51:37.260,The game...
00:51:37.761,00:51:38.970,"is over, Ted."
00:51:40.263,00:51:44.351,Your days of walking without the clatter of chains are gone.
00:51:45.852,00:51:50.232,"See, Florida is the buckle of the death belt and it's my job to..."
00:51:50.690,00:51:52.567,tighten things up in a major way.
00:51:54.236,00:51:57.322,"Bit excessive for stealing a car, don't you think?"
00:52:02.536,00:52:04.371,That's a thresher shark.
00:52:05.580,00:52:11.545,They have a tail that is as long as their-- I'm the sheriff of this town.
00:52:12.796,00:52:14.172,"See, Washington missed you."
00:52:14.673,00:52:16.383,Utah gave you away...
00:52:17.300,00:52:18.468,Colorado lost you...
00:52:19.719,00:52:20.804,I'm going to fry you.
00:52:30.981,00:52:33.733,Hey! What the hell? What the fuck is going on?
00:52:40.657,00:52:45.370,"There was an indictment last night, in the aftermath of a brutal crime in Tallahassee, Florida."
00:52:45.453,00:52:48.790,And what was unusual about the indictment was how it was delivered.
00:52:50.834,00:52:52.627,to an event rare in criminal cases.
00:52:52.711,00:52:59.467,Leon County Sheriff Ken Katsaris has conducted a public reading of the indictment of defendant Theodore Bundy in front of the gathered press.
00:52:59.551,00:53:00.719,"Please step out now, Ted."
00:53:01.219,00:53:02.762,"What is it? What do we have here, Ken?"
00:53:04.139,00:53:05.265,"Oh, it's an indictment!"
00:53:05.348,00:53:07.225,Why don't you... why don't you read that to me?
00:53:07.309,00:53:08.810,"Yes, I think I will. Thank you."
00:53:08.935,00:53:11.104,"-In the name of-- -You're up for reelection, aren't you?"
00:53:11.188,00:53:12.022,Reelection?
00:53:12.105,00:53:14.274,-In the name of... -You said you were gonna get me.
00:53:14.441,00:53:15.859,...the authority of the state...
00:53:15.942,00:53:17.110,He said he was gonna get me.
00:53:17.194,00:53:19.196,-...you are charged with... -You got the indictment.
00:53:19.279,00:53:24.659,That's all you're gonna get. -You are charged with two counts of murder in the first degree and three counts of attempted murder...
00:53:24.743,00:53:26.995,You know what? I'll plead not guilty right now.
00:53:27.245,00:53:32.542,...and three counts of attempted murder in the first degree in the Chi Omega sorority killings.
00:53:32.626,00:53:34.711,My chance to talk to the press. This is it.
00:53:34.794,00:53:36.796,"Well, we have displayed the prisoner now."
00:53:36.880,00:53:38.757,"Yeah, I've been kept in isolation."
00:53:38.840,00:53:40.217,I've been kept away from the press.
00:53:40.300,00:53:42.886,I have been buried by you. You've been talking.
00:53:42.969,00:53:44.429,It's my turn to talk now.
00:53:44.512,00:53:46.932,We... we have a court order. There will be no press interviews.
00:53:47.057,00:53:48.683,"Yeah, of course. That makes perfect sense."
00:53:48.767,00:53:50.936,Here. I'm gagged and you are not.
00:53:51.019,00:53:52.687,You know what? I will be heard.
00:53:52.771,00:53:54.314,"Thank you, Ken. Thank you."
00:53:54.814,00:53:56.608,"-Thank you,Ted. -Yeah, thanks, Ken."
00:53:56.816,00:53:58.526,There will be no questions at this time.
00:53:58.610,00:53:59.444,No questions.
00:54:01.029,00:54:03.365,linking Theodore Bundy to the Chi Omega killings continues.
00:54:03.490,00:54:10.789,News Watch 10 has learned that analysis of the more than 200 fingerprints found at the crime scene do not match Bundy's.
00:54:14.334,00:54:16.628,...since a few days after he escaped from a Colorado prison on New Year's Eve.
00:54:16.711,00:54:20.257,The apartment is less than a mile from the Chi Omega sorority house at Florida State.
00:54:24.010,00:54:28.515,"that his room was always in disarray, and that he slept only in a sleeping bag."
00:54:59.879,00:55:01.214,"Oh, Ted."
00:55:01.589,00:55:03.216,What have they done to you?
00:55:03.508,00:55:05.302,Are you okay? Why are you limping?
00:55:05.593,00:55:06.594,"I'm fine, I'm fine."
00:55:06.678,00:55:08.805,There's a problem with my leg.
00:55:10.307,00:55:11.558,I run too fast.
00:55:16.438,00:55:17.856,"Hey, no touching."
00:55:17.939,00:55:19.649,Yup. I know. Thank you.
00:55:20.525,00:55:21.526,Relax.
00:55:25.030,00:55:27.490,I can't believe what they've managed to do.
00:55:27.991,00:55:32.037,They're using me as a ploy for the Sheriff to win points in the next election.
00:55:32.120,00:55:33.747,I'm being used for political gain.
00:55:33.830,00:55:35.874,-My God. Of course. -Think about it.
00:55:35.957,00:55:42.047,He's been spinning his wheels on this sorority case and the biggest fish in America lands right in his little pond.
00:55:42.380,00:55:44.090,Who do you think he's gonna pin it on?
00:55:44.674,00:55:47.719,I literally just autographed my own wanted poster.
00:55:48.178,00:55:50.138,I'm more popular than Disney World.
00:55:56.728,00:55:57.687,It would...
00:55:58.021,00:55:59.481,probably feel good to...
00:56:01.858,00:56:03.693,have a familiar face around.
00:56:06.029,00:56:07.739,"What, you wanna move to Florida?"
00:56:09.115,00:56:10.158,Why not?
00:56:11.534,00:56:13.244,There are worse places to be.
00:56:20.835,00:56:22.295,It's great to see you.
00:56:51.282,00:56:52.242,Hey.
00:56:55.745,00:56:57.205,Brought you some chicken soup.
00:56:57.288,00:56:58.248,Thank you.
00:56:59.207,00:57:02.544,"I mean, you haven't been at work all week, so I figured you were sick."
00:57:06.548,00:57:07.424,All right.
00:57:07.924,00:57:09.300,All right. Feel better.
00:57:15.014,00:57:16.266,Do you wanna come in?
00:57:18.518,00:57:19.477,Yeah!
00:57:20.645,00:57:22.647,Molly will be home from school soon.
00:57:26.234,00:57:28.319,"Sorry, it's... a mess."
00:57:28.445,00:57:30.780,It's okay. Cleaner than my place.
00:57:39.831,00:57:40.665,Thank you.
00:57:42.625,00:57:43.710,Ted!
00:57:44.294,00:57:46.087,I'm Dan Dowd. I'll be your lead counsel.
00:57:46.171,00:57:49.507,I've got a great team of public defenders waiting in a private room.
00:57:50.425,00:57:52.760,We're gonna get you the best defense taxes can buy.
00:57:53.261,00:57:56.514,Should we go meet them so we can discuss this in private?
00:57:57.140,00:58:00.226,"Anything you have to say, you can say in front of Carole Ann."
00:58:01.186,00:58:02.812,"Yeah. Go ahead, have a seat."
00:58:06.024,00:58:07.817,"Hi, Carole Ann. Dan Dowd."
00:58:09.736,00:58:10.820,Is it true?
00:58:11.029,00:58:13.615,They're putting news cameras in the courtroom?
00:58:13.990,00:58:16.868,You'll be the first nationally televised trial in history.
00:58:17.160,00:58:18.995,"If you make it to trial, that is."
00:58:19.746,00:58:21.623,"The State is offering a deal, Ted."
00:58:21.706,00:58:28.087,"If you plead guilty to the murder charges, they've agreed to recommend life sentences instead of the death penalty."
00:58:29.422,00:58:30.840,"That's a joke, right?"
00:58:31.925,00:58:34.969,"We should really go and discuss this with the rest of the team, Ted."
00:58:35.386,00:58:40.725,"If you think there's a chance in hell I'll plead guilty to these charges, you're out of your fucking mind!"
00:58:44.354,00:58:46.147,"Let's discuss this another time, okay?"
00:58:46.231,00:58:47.273,Okay.
00:58:49.025,00:58:50.652,"Great to meet you, Carole Ann."
00:58:57.075,00:58:59.369,My own lawyers are against me.
00:58:59.452,00:59:00.912,This is a nightmare.
00:59:02.121,00:59:03.498,"So sorry, Ted."
00:59:06.334,00:59:07.835,Tell me what I can do to help.
00:59:09.337,00:59:15.802,"You know, maybe I could set the facts straight on the outside and make sure your side of the story is heard."
00:59:16.970,00:59:18.429,That would help a lot.
00:59:19.347,00:59:20.723,I'm under a gag order.
00:59:21.516,00:59:22.976,I can't say anything.
00:59:24.727,00:59:26.312,You'd be willing to do that for me?
00:59:27.605,00:59:28.606,Of course.
00:59:29.941,00:59:31.693,"Ted, I'm staying in Florida."
00:59:33.736,00:59:43.705,I would never ask you to do anything like this. I-- You're not asking. I'm insisting.
00:59:44.497,00:59:45.748,"Ted, you need me."
00:59:47.417,00:59:49.794,It wasn't an accident I saw you in Utah.
00:59:49.961,00:59:51.588,I don't have friends in Utah.
00:59:52.422,00:59:54.048,I was there for you.
00:59:56.217,00:59:59.679,"When I saw you were engaged, I got cold feet."
01:00:01.514,01:00:03.141,This trial could get ugly.
01:00:04.934,01:00:08.354,"I don't know, but, I mean, you can hear some really awful things."
01:00:08.646,01:00:11.441,Can't be any worse than what they're already saying on TV.
01:00:12.317,01:00:13.693,What do they know?
01:00:14.861,01:00:16.487,Not the truth.
01:00:18.615,01:00:21.034,-Do you have any comments on the trial? -Let me say this...
01:00:21.242,01:00:25.413,"This man is a threat to society, he's made a mockery of our justice system."
01:00:25.496,01:00:33.838,"That may have worked on the other side of the Rockies, but as lead prosecutor for the great state of Florida I have every intention of showing him how we do things in the Sunshine State."
01:00:34.088,01:00:36.424,"Now, this trial will be televised, so, uh..."
01:00:36.549,01:00:38.926,you can judge for yourself. That's all I have. Let's go.
01:00:42.138,01:00:51.105,"testing its case against Theodore Robert Bundy, a defendant described by some Miami residents as crazed and warped, by others as coolheaded and engaging."
01:00:51.189,01:00:56.319,"A jury of his peers, selected by Mr. Bundy, is a diversified lot."
01:00:58.863,01:01:00.239,in the Theodore Bundy murder trial.
01:01:02.825,01:01:05.745,by a still photographer and one television camera.
01:01:05.828,01:01:11.000,Upstairs there are some 250 reporters and television technicians from around the country.
01:01:15.338,01:01:18.675,Please rise for the Honorable Judge Edward D. Cowart.
01:01:24.847,01:01:25.682,Please sit.
01:01:28.976,01:01:37.193,"In regard to the camera, we are conducting the public's business and we're going to do it in the sunshine."
01:01:37.527,01:01:39.904,"After all, this is Florida."
01:01:42.907,01:01:44.367,"You look nice, partner."
01:01:45.076,01:01:46.077,"Thank you, Your Honor."
01:01:46.619,01:01:48.287,I'm disguised as an attorney today.
01:01:50.957,01:01:52.875,"Well, then. Let's put on a show."
01:02:07.724,01:02:10.393,"Ladies and gentlemen, this case..."
01:02:10.476,01:02:13.146,is so much more than a double murder.
01:02:18.234,01:02:20.361,is about catching a monster.
01:02:22.447,01:02:30.830,"In the early morning hours of January 15th, 1978, a young woman arrived home to the Chi Omega sorority house."
01:02:30.913,01:02:33.207,She heard a thump upstairs.
01:02:35.001,01:02:39.046,A man ran down carrying an oak log and fled.
01:02:39.589,01:02:48.473,The young woman went upstairs to investigate where her sorority sister stumbled out of her bedroom spitting up blood because her face had been smashed.
01:02:50.600,01:02:51.684,Her roommate's too.
01:02:51.768,01:02:54.479,She was sitting on her bed in a daze.
01:02:56.981,01:02:58.232,They were the lucky ones.
01:03:00.276,01:03:05.364,"In the room next over, another young woman was lying face down in her own blood."
01:03:05.698,01:03:08.284,Her neck had been twisted at an inhuman angle.
01:03:09.660,01:03:10.953,The jaw was broken.
01:03:12.914,01:03:14.207,She was missing a nipple.
01:03:15.875,01:03:17.376,Her body had bite marks on it.
01:03:18.252,01:03:19.545,She'd been raped...
01:03:19.962,01:03:21.255,and strangled.
01:03:21.672,01:03:28.221,"Strangled with a pantyhose garrote, so tight that her neck was constricted to half its size."
01:03:31.307,01:03:32.517,This next girl...
01:03:34.936,01:03:41.818,we're still not sure if she died from strangulation or the blow to her head that left a baseball-sized hole in her skull.
01:03:45.238,01:03:50.493,"We do know that her underwear was torn off with such force, it left burn marks on her thigh."
01:03:53.579,01:03:54.455,Thank you.
01:03:57.834,01:04:00.962,drawn by a fascination with the gruesome details of the crimes.
01:04:01.045,01:04:03.840,What is unusual to see is that many of the onlookers are women.
01:04:03.965,01:04:04.799,Young women.
01:04:04.882,01:04:09.178,"Every night, when I go home, I get very scared and shut the door and lock it."
01:04:09.387,01:04:11.389,"But... you know, he's..."
01:04:11.639,01:04:13.266,also really dreamy.
01:04:13.349,01:04:14.392,I'm not afraid of him.
01:04:14.475,01:04:16.477,He just doesn't seem like the type to kill somebody.
01:04:16.561,01:04:23.234,"I try to imagine myself in his place and imagine what he's feeling, and I wonder whether he did it or not."
01:04:25.862,01:04:27.488,that attracts them to the trial.
01:04:27.572,01:04:31.158,"I do think this is, in an underlying sense, a sexual attraction."
01:04:31.534,01:04:33.327,-Why do you do it? -I don't know...
01:04:34.036,01:04:35.121,I guess I love him.
01:04:38.499,01:04:40.418,Some have called her his girlfriend.
01:04:44.171,01:04:46.841,You can't explicitly call the media the villain.
01:04:46.924,01:04:48.801,We have to be more creative than that.
01:04:48.885,01:04:53.139,It is obvious that the media has already convicted him before he's had his day in court.
01:04:53.222,01:04:56.726,"Well, it's obvious the media has already convicted Ted before he's had his day in court."
01:04:56.809,01:05:00.146,To broadcast that-- And to broadcast it on a national stage...
01:05:00.229,01:05:06.444,"it's the first step in undercutting the judicial system because it makes it about getting ratings, not about getting the truth."
01:05:12.533,01:05:17.246,"When we questioned him about the crimes, he declined to have an attorney present."
01:05:17.330,01:05:20.207,He asked not to have counsel?
01:05:23.044,01:05:26.255,You need to trust me. We've worked very hard on-- You need to do your job!
01:05:26.380,01:05:29.008,Then he asked we turn off the recorder.
01:05:29.425,01:05:30.843,And no notes be taken.
01:05:30.927,01:05:33.054,So this was off the record?
01:05:33.220,01:05:34.180,He thought so.
01:05:34.263,01:05:39.560,"State of Florida allows bugs, surreptitious recording devices, but it malfunctioned."
01:05:39.644,01:05:41.604,That's why that part of the tape cuts out.
01:05:42.855,01:05:45.775,"-What part was that, Detective? -His confession."
01:05:45.858,01:05:49.278,"Do something, or I'm gonna-- What did he say in his confession?"
01:05:49.362,01:05:50.863,He said he was a vampire.
01:05:51.781,01:05:52.823,Objection!
01:05:54.825,01:05:55.660,Ted.
01:05:58.454,01:06:02.208,"It's narration on behalf of the witness, Your Honor."
01:06:05.878,01:06:06.963,Sustained.
01:06:10.841,01:06:29.735,"I also move to have the detective's entire testimony stricken from the record, on the basis that the word surreptitious should automatically disqualify anything masquerading as evidence, being that it's synonymous with secret, stealthy, clandestine, sneaky, sly, furtive, concealed, and hidden."
01:06:29.819,01:06:31.696,"Your Honor, is he allowed to keep talking?"
01:06:31.779,01:06:37.243,"No true evidence should, could, or would ever be described in such terms."
01:06:37.410,01:06:40.871,"-Your Honor, the jury-- -Objection is sustained."
01:06:41.455,01:06:50.297,The jury is admonished to disregard the witness's testimony as it pertains to the alleged confession.
01:06:51.507,01:06:52.383,Your Honor...
01:06:52.925,01:06:54.677,One other thing while I have your ear.
01:06:54.844,01:06:57.096,"Uh, quit while you're ahead, partner."
01:06:57.179,01:06:59.807,You notice I didn't say how far ahead.
01:07:00.099,01:07:01.308,Bless your heart.
01:07:01.392,01:07:02.435,"Okay, thank you."
01:07:02.560,01:07:03.894,"Thank you, Your Honor."
01:07:14.071,01:07:15.281,When I say object...
01:07:16.073,01:07:16.907,object.
01:07:20.870,01:07:29.253,The jury is unaware of the squabbles and these conflicts have apparently not affected the way the defendant views his chances of acquittal.
01:07:43.017,01:07:44.101,Who are you calling?
01:07:44.518,01:07:51.567,"Oh.. just-- -My lawyers. -Oh, bunny."
01:07:52.902,01:07:54.737,How do you keep your spirits up?
01:07:55.279,01:07:56.655,Don't you get down?
01:08:04.288,01:08:05.873,I never lose hope.
01:08:10.044,01:08:13.672,"This is a game, and I will not be party to it."
01:08:13.839,01:08:15.925,I will not stay in this kind of Waterloo.
01:08:16.008,01:08:19.095,There comes a time when I have to say whoa.
01:08:19.178,01:08:21.680,"If you say whoa, I'm gonna have to use spurs."
01:08:23.015,01:08:26.268,"Since I have been in Dade County-- Don't shake your finger at me, young man."
01:08:26.393,01:08:30.189,I have been strip-searched-- Don't shake your finger at me.
01:08:30.773,01:08:33.359,That's fine. You can shake it at Mr. Dowd.
01:08:35.069,01:08:37.154,Since I have been in Dade County...
01:08:37.530,01:08:40.199,I did not have any choice in the selection of my attorney.
01:08:40.282,01:08:48.082,"Sir, I don't know of any case where an individual has received the quality and quantity of counsel you have."
01:08:48.165,01:08:53.129,It is unheard-- You have had more counsel than a duck has quacks.
01:08:53.504,01:09:00.386,I have never seen anything like it in my 27 years trying cases at the bar.
01:09:02.179,01:09:03.639,for accused murderer Theodore Bundy.
01:09:03.764,01:09:08.561,"First, a member of the defense team handed out a motion which calls for the removal of all cameras in the courtroom."
01:09:08.644,01:09:12.398,The motion says media interferes with the defendant's right to a fair trial.
01:09:12.523,01:09:15.401,But Judge Edward Cowart refused and the motion was denied.
01:09:15.568,01:09:22.074,"In another blow, Judge Cowart also denied a motion to suppress evidence from a case in Utah, where several items were seized -- Mom?"
01:09:26.912,01:09:27.788,What is this?
01:09:29.039,01:09:29.915,Hmm?
01:09:31.584,01:09:32.877,Some kind of ambush?
01:09:32.960,01:09:34.044,"No, bunny. No."
01:09:34.253,01:09:36.797,Your lawyers have something important they want to discuss.
01:09:36.881,01:09:37.715,Okay.
01:09:37.798,01:09:39.550,"I thought it'd be best your mom be here, too."
01:09:39.633,01:09:41.010,Okay. All right.
01:09:41.093,01:09:43.179,I wouldn't be able to live if I lost you.
01:09:43.762,01:09:45.055,Did he put you up to this?
01:09:45.139,01:09:51.395,"Ted, when you consider the evidence they have, combined with pre-trial publicity, it's highly likely they can secure convictions."
01:09:51.478,01:09:54.481,"And because of the nature of the offenses, several death sentences."
01:09:54.565,01:09:56.650,"I'm not pleading, okay?"
01:09:56.734,01:09:58.527,A mother cannot outlive her son.
01:09:58.611,01:09:59.862,"Mom, look at me."
01:10:00.237,01:10:01.405,I am innocent.
01:10:01.614,01:10:02.823,"You know that, right?"
01:10:02.907,01:10:07.578,I did not do these things despite what anyone here may have told you.
01:10:07.870,01:10:09.413,I want the world to know that.
01:10:09.496,01:10:11.123,-We know! -I want everyone to know that.
01:10:11.207,01:10:14.126,We know. Your mom knows. We all know you're innocent.
01:10:14.835,01:10:18.589,We're going to fight every day to make sure everyone else does too.
01:10:18.672,01:10:22.635,"But... if they take your life, it'll all be for nothing."
01:10:24.887,01:10:25.930,Okay.
01:10:27.014,01:10:30.100,"All right. okay, I'll consider their plea."
01:10:30.184,01:10:32.478,"Happy? Can we all disband now, please?"
01:10:32.561,01:10:34.188,-This is really awkward. -Guard!
01:10:35.064,01:10:36.148,Jesus Christ!
01:10:37.566,01:10:38.484,Thank you.
01:10:39.235,01:10:40.653,"Don't be angry, Teddy."
01:10:40.736,01:10:42.279,We were just trying to help you.
01:10:42.363,01:10:44.156,What the hell are you thinking?
01:10:45.074,01:10:46.867,Bringing my mom into this?
01:10:47.743,01:10:50.329,Don't ever do that again.
01:10:50.996,01:10:51.830,Ever.
01:10:52.289,01:10:53.749,I was just trying to help.
01:10:54.416,01:10:55.876,I'm sorry. I'm...
01:10:56.543,01:10:57.670,I love you.
01:10:58.379,01:11:00.631,I just don't want them to take your life.
01:11:01.757,01:11:03.092,I don't trust this jury.
01:11:03.175,01:11:04.134,I'm scared.
01:11:04.551,01:11:06.095,"I'm really scared, Ted."
01:11:27.783,01:11:32.621,I understand there is a matter you would like to present to the court?
01:11:41.880,01:11:42.965,Your Honor...
01:11:44.550,01:11:47.678,never have I encountered a man...
01:11:48.637,01:11:53.392,so dedicated and brazen...
01:11:54.560,01:11:58.314,in coercing his own client into admitting guilt.
01:11:59.148,01:12:06.322,It makes me wonder if he has the stamina or basic mental acuity to roll up his sleeves and do the hard work.
01:12:07.114,01:12:13.329,I will not accept my so-called attorney's advice that I plead guilty to save my own life.
01:12:13.412,01:12:15.748,"I am, in fact, not guilty."
01:12:16.123,01:12:22.338,"And I demand the discharge of my roundly inept counsel, as is my right under Faretta v. California."
01:12:22.463,01:12:25.132,"Your Honor, I would like to resign as counsel."
01:12:25.257,01:12:27.009,Counselor's first words I can agree to.
01:12:27.092,01:12:29.845,"-Fuck you! -Counselors, muzzle yourselves."
01:12:29.928,01:12:31.347,I'll consider the motion granted.
01:12:32.348,01:12:33.474,How's this for motion?
01:12:39.438,01:12:44.401,accused murderer Theodore Bundy has demanded that he be allowed to take an active part in his own defense.
01:12:44.485,01:12:49.698,"Now with only a few days left, the former law student announced he intended to take over as chief counsel."
01:12:50.616,01:12:55.579,The prosecution is expected to wrap up its case this afternoon with further testimony from its star witness.
01:13:02.419,01:13:07.883,showed the pictures of the teeth of the defendant Theodore Bundy and the bite mark found on the body of one of the slain coeds.
01:13:07.966,01:13:11.845,He showed the court the peculiarities of Bundy's slightly crooked upper front teeth.
01:13:12.221,01:13:13.972,You can see the double bite...
01:13:14.264,01:13:20.437,which exhibits the same unique pattern as the defendant's chipped upper right central incisor.
01:13:20.521,01:13:33.367,"Doctor, can you offer an opinion, within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, whether or not those teeth represented in that photograph made the bite marks on the buttocks of Lisa Levy?"
01:13:33.492,01:13:34.993,"Yes, sir. I can."
01:13:35.369,01:13:38.747,The defendants teeth made those marks.
01:13:41.250,01:13:42.584,"I, uh, pass the witness."
01:13:42.668,01:13:44.837,"Doctor, you may return to the witness box."
01:13:51.969,01:13:57.182,is there any way to test whether those teeth will make the same marks over and over?
01:13:57.433,01:13:58.392,Yes.
01:13:58.684,01:14:02.104,I took models of the defendant's teeth and I went to the morgue.
01:14:02.396,01:14:06.108,And I pressed those models into the buttocks area of different individuals...
01:14:06.191,01:14:08.193,"and yes, they do match."
01:14:09.486,01:14:12.322,you did this experiment on cadavers?
01:14:12.406,01:14:15.033,"Well, I couldn't find any live volunteers."
01:14:15.117,01:14:18.036,I have to question the competency of this expert witness.
01:14:18.120,01:14:20.914,"Your Honor, I question the competency of this entire trial."
01:14:20.998,01:14:22.124,This is a farce.
01:14:22.875,01:14:26.086,"Dr. Souviron, on that we could not agree more."
01:14:30.549,01:14:37.306,I feel duty-bound to remind you in the gallery that you are not on spring break.
01:14:37.556,01:14:42.519,You are not waiting for the Flipper and Friends show at SeaWorld.
01:14:42.603,01:14:45.063,It is a capital murder case.
01:14:47.149,01:14:53.864,"The court has already ruled on this witness' expertise, counselor."
01:14:54.072,01:14:56.575,And you are skating on thin ice.
01:14:56.658,01:14:59.870,And ice does not last long in Florida.
01:15:00.537,01:15:01.413,"Yes, Your Honor."
01:15:11.673,01:15:15.302,two Florida State coeds and beating three others a year and a half ago...
01:15:20.682,01:15:21.808,"Uh, yeah, sure."
01:15:24.603,01:15:25.562,Hello?
01:15:26.104,01:15:27.147,Who is this?
01:15:31.735,01:15:33.362,"Yes, this is Ted."
01:15:33.862,01:15:35.405,And I would like to speak to Liz.
01:15:36.156,01:15:37.741,You can't call her anymore.
01:15:38.367,01:15:39.409,You're killing her.
01:15:40.494,01:15:42.955,"Then, will you please give her a message for me?"
01:15:43.539,01:15:45.123,"Can you do that, please?"
01:15:46.208,01:15:47.626,"Can you tell her, um.."
01:15:50.546,01:15:52.172,Can you tell her that I love her?
01:17:09.625,01:17:10.709,"Oh, wow!"
01:17:15.631,01:17:16.548,Ted?
01:17:19.801,01:17:20.761,Ted?
01:17:23.013,01:17:23.972,Look at me!
01:17:24.973,01:17:25.849,Huh?
01:17:26.308,01:17:27.392,Do you...
01:17:28.727,01:17:29.853,Do you still love her?
01:17:31.521,01:17:33.148,What are you talking about? Who?
01:17:33.815,01:17:34.733,"Oh, my God."
01:17:35.150,01:17:36.943,"-No... -Oh, my God. I'm so stupid."
01:17:37.027,01:17:41.156,"Carole Ann, just-- I mean, I just uprooted my entire life for you!"
01:17:41.323,01:17:42.532,She's not here!
01:17:43.492,01:17:45.494,-But you love her! -I don't! I don't!
01:17:45.577,01:17:46.828,She abandoned me!
01:17:46.912,01:17:48.163,She left me.
01:17:48.664,01:17:49.790,She's gone.
01:17:50.874,01:17:52.376,What about me?
01:17:53.669,01:17:54.670,I love you.
01:17:54.836,01:17:55.754,You're here.
01:17:56.630,01:17:58.090,You're right here.
01:17:58.173,01:18:00.092,I almost married that girl.
01:18:04.012,01:18:05.639,And... and you know what?
01:18:06.056,01:18:08.100,You're the one I should've married.
01:18:10.185,01:18:11.478,Do you mean that?
01:18:12.562,01:18:13.522,Yeah.
01:18:14.356,01:18:15.565,Just imagine it.
01:18:18.485,01:18:19.569,I'll get out of here.
01:18:21.238,01:18:22.364,We can get a house...
01:18:23.573,01:18:24.616,on the Sound.
01:18:26.284,01:18:27.411,With a Mercedes...
01:18:29.204,01:18:30.372,and a dog.
01:18:32.124,01:18:33.583,I can hear him barking.
01:18:35.252,01:18:36.128,Can you?
01:18:38.422,01:18:39.840,I'm allergic to dogs.
01:18:42.300,01:18:43.760,But that sounds nice.
01:18:44.803,01:18:45.971,"Oh, Ted."
01:18:48.432,01:18:50.308,I just wish we didn't have to wait.
01:18:52.185,01:18:53.770,Who says we have to wait?
01:18:54.688,01:18:55.731,We don't.
01:19:00.485,01:19:01.737,Miss Boone.
01:19:02.529,01:19:07.534,"Did you visit me while I was being held in Florida in custody in February, 1978?"
01:19:08.452,01:19:10.203,"Yes. Yes, I did."
01:19:10.287,01:19:14.875,"And to the best of your memory, did I have any sort of chip in my front tooth at that time?"
01:19:14.958,01:19:17.294,"No. No, you most definitely did not."
01:19:19.254,01:19:21.298,I think you see what I'm getting at here.
01:19:22.174,01:19:25.886,I would like to subpoena all newspapers to turn over their negatives of me.
01:19:26.636,01:19:43.278,"If the chip did not occur until March, 1978, two months after the Chi Omega crimes and the state's odontologists say otherwise, the state's odontologists have obviously taken my teeth and twisted them every which way but loose to fit."
01:19:44.237,01:19:52.537,"Son, you can jump up and down and hang from the chandelier, but the court will not dash out for new evidence at your command."
01:19:54.831,01:19:57.375,Is there no work ethic left here in Florida?
01:19:57.459,01:19:58.960,"You impress me not, sir."
01:19:59.044,01:20:00.670,"The feeling is mutual, Your Honor."
01:20:00.754,01:20:02.589,I'm sure it is. Bless your heart.
01:20:02.672,01:20:06.468,"And unless there is anything else, Miss Boone may be excused."
01:20:06.593,01:20:09.179,"No, there is one-- Just one more thing."
01:20:09.763,01:20:10.722,Your Honor...
01:20:17.187,01:20:18.355,Will you marry me?
01:20:21.441,01:20:22.275,Your Honor...
01:20:27.572,01:20:29.032,Then I do hereby...
01:20:29.908,01:20:30.826,marry you.
01:20:30.909,01:20:32.494,Are you shitting me? Objection!
01:20:33.578,01:20:40.377,"a public declaration properly phrased, in an open courtroom, in the presence of court officers constitutes a lawful marriage here in Florida."
01:20:41.503,01:20:42.754,Indeed it does.
01:20:55.851,01:20:57.602,Was it him who called the other day?
01:21:01.147,01:21:03.608,I know you unplug the phones when I fall asleep.
01:21:04.943,01:21:06.111,What did he say?
01:21:06.903,01:21:08.822,-It doesn't matter. -What did he say?
01:21:10.407,01:21:11.491,He froze.
01:21:11.616,01:21:14.703,He froze because he knew that I knew what he was.
01:21:14.786,01:21:17.289,"They're going to send him to the chair, Liz."
01:21:17.372,01:21:22.085,And that seems like an easier out than this torture you're putting yourself through because you won't let him go.
01:21:22.168,01:21:24.337,He's killing you because you're letting him.
01:21:25.422,01:21:28.842,You're just jealous because Ted and I have a bond you and I never could.
01:21:30.427,01:21:32.012,You're just trying to hurt me.
01:21:32.929,01:21:33.972,Get out.
01:21:36.766,01:21:37.893,Get out!
01:21:38.059,01:21:39.728,-You need to let him go. -Get out!
01:21:39.811,01:21:43.899,-You need-- Let him go! -Get out! Get out! Get out!
01:21:45.942,01:21:46.902,It's okay.
01:21:47.277,01:21:49.154,I wish I could take it all back.
01:21:49.237,01:21:50.405,It's okay.
01:21:54.034,01:21:55.076,Take what back?
01:21:55.368,01:21:59.205,Why do you act like you're responsible for the things that happened to him?
01:22:07.172,01:22:09.382,I'm the one who gave his name to the police.
01:22:13.803,01:22:20.143,"neck-length hair, brown to light brown, dark tan, 160 pounds, cast on the left arm."
01:22:22.062,01:22:27.317,Back when those girls disappeared from Lake Sammamish I saw the sketch.
01:22:27.400,01:22:34.032,"It's a minor resemblance, but it's very, very minor and-- It's a 1968 Volkswagen Bug."
01:22:34.240,01:22:37.118,But it's kind of a light beige-- Let me stop you right there.
01:22:37.202,01:22:39.454,"It's the right car, but it's the wrong color."
01:22:40.163,01:22:41.247,He's not the guy.
01:22:41.414,01:22:44.000,I can put his name down if it'll help you sleep at night.
01:22:44.292,01:22:46.294,-What is his name? -Um...
01:22:48.421,01:22:49.339,Ted.
01:22:50.840,01:22:52.008,Ted Bundy.
01:22:52.092,01:22:53.677,I could be the reason that he's there.
01:22:53.760,01:23:03.311,"Because everyone's assuming that all these other murders were done by Ted and all I did was call his name in to Seattle, because of a sketch that looked kind of like him."
01:23:03.728,01:23:05.063,You were the one that told them.
01:23:06.022,01:23:07.649,You shouldn't be ashamed of that.
01:23:08.066,01:23:11.486,"If you told them that-- He... he deserves it, Liz."
01:23:11.653,01:23:13.196,"Liz, you did the right thing."
01:23:16.533,01:23:18.368,You just gotta let him go.
01:23:20.370,01:23:23.289,"Mr. Simpson, your closing argument."
01:23:31.256,01:23:40.390,"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you have been witness to the unspeakable horrors of the defendant's heinous crimes."
01:23:41.349,01:23:42.517,You've seen...
01:23:42.851,01:23:46.896,"ghastly injuries, smashed in faces, broken jaws..."
01:23:51.109,01:23:53.403,The bite-mark carnage of a predator.
01:23:56.322,01:24:00.452,there are two ways for police to investigate crimes.
01:24:01.494,01:24:03.079,They can go to a crime scene...
01:24:04.414,01:24:09.669,search for clues and follow those clues to a logical conclusion...
01:24:09.753,01:24:14.966,We have provided forensic expert testimony to corroborate every last bit of evidence.
01:24:15.091,01:24:26.311,"...or they can begin with a suspect, decide on that suspect, and then somehow make all of the evidence fit only that suspect."
01:24:26.394,01:24:34.486,"You've seen the bottle of hair mist he used to sexually penetrate one of the victims, in a manner so savage it ruptured her internal organs."
01:24:34.819,01:24:42.327,It is clearly a charade to cast an innocent man as some sort of monster in a horror film.
01:24:42.410,01:24:44.579,We have placed the defendant at the scene of the crime...
01:24:44.662,01:24:49.417,"Their own witness testified that the man wore a mask, obscuring half of his face."
01:24:49.501,01:24:53.296,You've seen the oak log he used to bludgeon these poor victims.
01:24:53.588,01:24:54.839,The lighting was low.
01:24:54.923,01:25:06.643,The State of Florida has proved beyond all reasonable doubt that the defendant Theodore Robert Bundy is guilty of two murders in the first-degree and three attempted murders.
01:25:06.726,01:25:08.853,"Ladies and gentlemen, I am..."
01:25:10.021,01:25:11.731,that innocent suspect.
01:25:14.901,01:25:18.113,"Ted, Ted, is this really just a case of wrong place, wrong time?"
01:25:18.404,01:25:20.532,"You know, police, they just wanna solve crimes."
01:25:20.615,01:25:22.826,And sometimes they don't think things all the way through.
01:25:22.909,01:25:25.620,They are willing to take the convenient alternative.
01:25:25.703,01:25:28.206,"And in this case, the convenient alternative was me."
01:25:30.500,01:25:31.709,They've come to verdict.
01:25:31.876,01:25:34.003,"Oh, my gosh. Seven hours."
01:25:34.879,01:25:35.880,Well...
01:25:36.840,01:25:37.799,bless their hearts.
01:25:41.719,01:25:43.805,You know that future you saw for us?
01:25:44.347,01:25:46.266,The one with the house and the dog and the car?
01:25:47.308,01:25:48.977,"Well, yeah. Yeah."
01:25:49.602,01:25:50.478,Well...
01:25:51.271,01:25:53.606,now there's going to be another part to that future.
01:25:56.985,01:25:57.861,Ted...
01:25:58.027,01:25:59.154,it's time to go.
01:26:00.613,01:26:01.489,Ted.
01:26:01.906,01:26:05.660,"Yeah... yeah, I-- I'll-- One... just one moment. Um..."
01:26:13.960,01:26:15.295,Let's go finish this thing.
01:26:23.011,01:26:27.140,"I am in receipt of the jury's verdict, Bailiff."
01:26:27.932,01:26:32.187,Would you deliver this to the clerk for pronouncement?
01:26:34.647,01:26:36.524,Will the defendant rise?
01:26:42.030,01:26:53.291,"We, the jury, in Miami-Dade County, Florida, find the defendant Theodore Robert Bundy, on the count of murder in the first degree of Lisa Levy, guilty as charged."
01:26:53.458,01:26:57.712,"On the count of murder in the first degree of Margaret Bowman, guilty as charged."
01:26:57.795,01:27:01.549,On the count of attempted murder in the first degree of Karen Chandler...
01:27:02.175,01:27:03.176,guilty as charged.
01:27:03.801,01:27:07.305,On the count of attempted murder in the first degree of Kathy Kleiner...
01:27:07.847,01:27:09.098,guilty as charged.
01:27:09.557,01:27:13.228,On the count of attempted murder in the first degree of Cheryl Thomas...
01:27:13.895,01:27:15.146,guilty as charged.
01:27:15.480,01:27:16.564,So say we all.
01:27:23.321,01:27:31.746,"to be one of the most primitive, barbaric things one human can impose on another."
01:27:34.082,01:27:42.215,My Christian upbringing tells me that to take another's life under any circumstance is wrong.
01:27:44.092,01:27:47.637,And I don't believe that the State of Florida is above the laws of God.
01:27:48.721,01:27:49.847,"Thank you, ma'am."
01:27:51.557,01:27:52.475,Bless you.
01:27:54.936,01:27:57.146,While I certainly agree it is...
01:27:58.523,01:28:04.862,always a tragedy when any life is taken against one's will...
01:28:09.117,01:28:16.291,it is this court's reasoned judgement you be adjudicated guilty of murder in the first degree...
01:28:17.250,01:28:30.847,"that the killings were indeed atrocious and cruel in that they were extremely wicked, shockingly evil, vile..."
01:28:31.306,01:28:42.275,and with utter indifference to human life and that you shall be put to death by current of electricity that shall pass through your body until you are dead.
01:28:43.318,01:28:47.697,"I understand you have a statement you'd like to make, and you may do so now."
01:28:49.157,01:28:51.117,I won't ask for mercy.
01:28:53.661,01:28:54.662,In fact...
01:28:56.581,01:29:01.502,I find it absurd to ask for mercy for something that I did not do.
01:29:05.840,01:29:08.634,I'm not the one responsible for these...
01:29:09.761,01:29:10.928,horrific acts.
01:29:14.932,01:29:17.977,Although the verdict found in part...
01:29:19.562,01:29:22.273,that these crimes had been committed...
01:29:24.859,01:29:25.735,it erred...
01:29:26.944,01:29:29.113,in finding who committed them.
01:29:32.617,01:29:34.202,As a consequence...
01:29:35.328,01:29:42.794,I do not accept the sentence because it is not a sentence of me.
01:29:45.755,01:29:50.927,It is a sentence of someone else who is not standing here today.
01:29:52.804,01:29:57.767,The court is going to sentence the person found guilty of the offense.
01:29:58.184,01:30:00.311,"Your name, sir, was on that verdict."
01:30:01.145,01:30:03.147,"Take care of yourself, young man."
01:30:03.648,01:30:05.775,"I say that to you, sincerely."
01:30:06.526,01:30:07.777,Take care of yourself.
01:30:09.028,01:30:10.696,You're a bright young man.
01:30:11.823,01:30:13.533,You'd have made a good lawyer.
01:30:13.616,01:30:16.244,I would've loved to have you practice in front of me.
01:30:16.702,01:30:17.745,But...
01:30:18.037,01:30:20.540,"you went to a different way, partner."
01:30:21.749,01:30:31.092,It is been a tragedy for this court to see the total waste of humanity that we have experienced here.
01:30:33.052,01:30:35.888,I don't have any animosity toward you.
01:30:36.597,01:30:38.015,I want you to know that.
01:30:40.226,01:30:41.519,Take care of yourself.
01:31:20.433,01:31:24.979,but your numbers are incredibly high and you are doing an outstanding job so far.
01:31:25.104,01:31:26.814,This is a really wonderful place for women.
01:31:26.939,01:31:29.150,"Liz, I thought you'd like to see this."
01:31:29.275,01:31:30.318,"Thanks, Janet."
01:31:35.698,01:31:37.992,"Would you, uh... would you give me a moment, please?"
01:31:38.117,01:31:39.035,Of course.
01:31:52.215,01:31:53.633,This will be my last letter.
01:31:54.717,01:31:57.678,"And if anyone deserves to hear it as it was, it's you."
01:32:02.225,01:32:04.519,I admit I am in a little trouble.
01:32:05.645,01:32:07.438,But it's all going to work out.
01:32:14.445,01:32:18.991,"scheduled to die in Florida's electric chair tomorrow, today won a 24-hour stay."
01:32:20.993,01:32:24.664,"are here to document Bundy's every last move, meal and mood."
01:32:28.167,01:32:32.505,An apparent last-minute attempt to be declared incompetent for execution.
01:33:19.885,01:33:21.429,That's a beautiful ring.
01:33:23.139,01:33:24.515,Do you remember the night we met?
01:33:27.351,01:33:29.270,"We started with lies, Ted."
01:33:29.979,01:33:32.523,My love for you was never a lie.
01:33:33.816,01:33:36.527,I fell in love with you the moment I saw you.
01:33:36.736,01:33:39.363,I need to hear the truth from you now.
01:33:39.864,01:33:43.034,"Come on, you know that I'm not capable of these crimes."
01:33:43.492,01:33:45.494,I would never hurt a woman.
01:33:45.661,01:33:48.956,Have I ever laid a hand on you? Have I ever raised my voice?
01:33:49.040,01:33:51.584,I'm the one who gave your name to the police.
01:33:53.836,01:33:54.920,What?
01:33:58.049,01:34:08.601,"It was 1974, when they put that sketch in the paper of the man at Lake Sammamish, who used a fake cast to lure two young women into his Volkswagen Bug."
01:34:08.976,01:34:11.020,Is he ever gonna find out that it was me who called?
01:34:12.772,01:34:13.981,"Now, what is your name?"
01:34:14.940,01:34:21.489,I used to think that I ruined your life because my call to King County made you the suspect in all these other cases.
01:34:22.031,01:34:26.744,For years I've carried this guilt that I'm to blame for everything.
01:34:27.828,01:34:29.747,Why would you blame yourself?
01:34:30.164,01:34:34.669,Because I could have helped save some of these girls if only I hadn't trusted you.
01:34:35.628,01:34:37.713,"I can't live like this anymore, Ted."
01:34:38.047,01:34:39.507,It's not my guilt.
01:34:40.216,01:34:41.300,It's yours.
01:34:43.636,01:34:46.764,"Did you do these things, Ted?"
01:34:49.100,01:34:50.476,Of course not.
01:34:50.601,01:34:56.857,There are detectives from seven states out there lined up with arms of open case files expecting confessions.
01:34:56.941,01:34:58.442,"I didn't do anything, Liz."
01:34:58.526,01:35:00.486,Then why are you going to tell them that you did?
01:35:02.029,01:35:03.447,"That's what you're doing, right?"
01:35:03.823,01:35:05.366,Trading the truth to buy more time?
01:35:05.449,01:35:07.368,I have to tell them what they wanna hear.
01:35:07.827,01:35:09.704,They will fry me any day now.
01:35:10.121,01:35:12.081,It's the only way to save my own life.
01:35:12.164,01:35:17.169,"So, yes, I'm feeding them information, little bits of bullshit, but none of it is true."
01:35:17.545,01:35:19.130,This is all gonna end.
01:35:20.256,01:35:22.216,It's only gonna end with the truth.
01:35:23.718,01:35:25.803,Did you do it?
01:35:27.471,01:35:28.305,No.
01:35:28.806,01:35:32.601,"Denise Naslund and Janice Ott, the two young women from Lake Sammamish?"
01:35:32.935,01:35:33.811,No.
01:35:34.353,01:35:36.939,The young woman from Utah who couldn't even look at you in court?
01:35:37.022,01:35:37.857,No.
01:35:38.232,01:35:39.608,The Colorado women?
01:35:40.443,01:35:41.694,"Oh, Liz."
01:35:42.236,01:35:44.447,You've always been so insatiable.
01:35:44.530,01:35:47.241,And it's clear you've come here with an agenda. And I'm sorry...
01:35:48.117,01:35:50.077,I can't give you what you want.
01:35:50.619,01:35:52.997,The Chi Omega college girls from Florida?
01:35:53.080,01:35:55.207,Absolutely not.
01:35:55.541,01:35:57.877,"One of your victims was a child, Ted."
01:35:58.669,01:36:00.129,Kimberly Leach.
01:36:00.838,01:36:01.964,She was 12.
01:36:02.631,01:36:05.885,Twelve! And I let you be alone with Molly!
01:36:05.968,01:36:08.304,"I did not do these things, Liz!"
01:36:10.347,01:36:12.391,Did you ever wanna do them to me?
01:36:16.729,01:36:18.439,I wish that we could be alone.
01:36:18.522,01:36:20.065,We could really talk.
01:36:20.441,01:36:22.401,I can't tell you anything right now.
01:36:22.526,01:36:24.069,"Liz, there's people listening."
01:36:24.195,01:36:25.988,"Are you telling me that you're sick, Ted?"
01:36:26.071,01:36:27.198,Back off!
01:36:27.698,01:36:31.827,"I told you the truth, and now you need to do the same for me."
01:36:32.912,01:36:34.538,I've been suffocating!
01:36:34.622,01:36:37.750,"All these years, I've had your hands around my neck."
01:36:39.960,01:36:41.295,Release me!
01:36:43.547,01:36:44.924,"Not you, Liz."
01:36:47.885,01:36:49.345,Anyone but you.
01:37:11.784,01:37:14.328,It took me over a decade to look at this photo.
01:37:16.497,01:37:19.291,What happened to her head?
01:37:26.173,01:37:28.551,If she was deposited in the woods...
01:37:31.929,01:37:37.893,then animals could've conceivably done something like-- Animals don't do that!
01:37:43.983,01:37:45.526,I'm not a bad guy.
01:37:47.403,01:37:51.031,"You need to release me, Ted!"
01:37:54.368,01:37:57.413,What happened to her head?
01:39:18.160,01:39:18.994,Hey.
01:39:21.705,01:39:22.790,Detective Fisher.
01:39:23.457,01:39:24.541,Let's begin.
01:40:17.136,01:40:18.012,What are you doing?
01:40:18.429,01:40:20.055,Reading. I'm prepping for the trial.
01:40:25.102,01:40:26.562,"Promise you'll never leave me, Liz."
01:40:36.113,01:40:37.781,"Well, I don't even know your name."
01:40:59.678,01:41:00.888,"Oh, there she is."
01:41:11.231,01:41:12.357,You all right?
01:41:12.816,01:41:13.859,I am.
01:41:14.109,01:41:15.527,"I'm proud of you, Mom."
01:42:26.932,01:42:31.103,The media are the ones that are making him the prime suspect. We are not.
01:42:34.148,01:42:35.566,I'm not guilty.
01:42:37.776,01:42:41.530,Does that include the time I stole a comic book when I was 5 years-old?
01:42:42.364,01:42:44.950,I'm not guilty of the charges which have been filed against me.
01:42:45.242,01:42:46.869,"Step out, Mr. Bundy."
01:42:51.874,01:42:53.876,"What do we have here, Ken? Let's see."
01:42:53.959,01:42:55.377,"Oh, it's an indictment. All right."
01:42:55.544,01:42:56.920,Why don't you read it to me?
01:42:57.004,01:42:59.006,"You're up for reelection, aren't you?"
01:42:59.298,01:43:01.633,-Mr. Bundy-- -You told them that you were gonna get me.
01:43:01.884,01:43:04.386,"He said he was gonna get me. Okay, you got the indictment."
01:43:04.553,01:43:05.804,It's all you're going to get.
01:43:05.888,01:43:07.598,Let's read it. Let's go.
01:43:11.476,01:43:15.647,"Let me put it this way, I don't think that Ted belongs in jail."
01:43:15.939,01:43:21.028,The things in Florida don't concern me any more than the things out West do.
01:43:24.072,01:43:26.491,protesting conditions at the Dade County Jail.
01:43:27.451,01:43:34.708,"Since I have been in Dade County, I've been-- Don't shake your finger at me, young man!"
01:43:38.128,01:43:39.546,to be a difficult client.
01:43:40.839,01:43:43.008,Bundy appeared to find this humorous.
01:43:45.594,01:43:49.097,Um... he just seemed like a normal...
01:43:50.224,01:43:55.604,a normal person that didn't seem like he would use any kind of violence on anyone.
01:43:58.023,01:43:59.650,was the bite mark testimony.
01:44:00.317,01:44:03.028,"And the bite mark, that was the most damaging evidence."
01:44:05.530,01:44:09.368,We're very satisfied with what verdict we did get in this case.
01:44:09.451,01:44:12.496,We couldn't have expected it to be any better than it was.
01:44:14.373,01:44:16.959,"the death penalty itself, to be..."
01:44:17.417,01:44:23.632,"the most primitive, barbaric thing that one human being can impose upon another."
01:44:24.258,01:44:31.640,It's a tragedy for this court to see such a total waste of humanity that I've experienced in this court.
01:44:31.723,01:44:33.475,You're a bright young man.
01:44:34.518,01:44:35.769,You'd have made a good lawyer.
01:44:35.852,01:44:37.896,I'd have loved to have you practice in front of me.
01:44:38.063,01:44:39.523,"But you went another way, partner."
01:44:45.654,01:44:47.906,Hundreds of onlookers were in a festive mood.
01:44:47.990,01:44:58.166,"For the man who murdered dozens of women, the irony of the final act of justice is that it may have been carried out by a female executioner hidden from Bundy and others by a black hood."
01:45:04.339,01:45:05.257,Well...
01:45:05.757,01:45:06.591,um...
01:45:07.050,01:45:08.343,"gee, that name sounds funny."
01:45:08.427,01:45:11.221,"You know, I hear Ted Bundy in so many different contexts."
01:45:11.471,01:45:12.472,I stay me.
