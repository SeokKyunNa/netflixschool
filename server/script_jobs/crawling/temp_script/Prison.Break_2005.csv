00:00:28.487,00:00:32.157,look at it for a minute?
00:00:33.283,00:00:35.327,"You're an artist, Sid."
00:00:37.329,00:00:40.332,You're telling me you're just gonna walk out of here and I'm never gonna see it again?
00:00:41.458,00:00:43.335,"There's a good chance of that, yes."
00:00:45.253,00:00:48.089,"Most guys, you know, for the first one, they start with something small."
00:00:48.131,00:00:50.926,"Mom, girlfriend's initials, something like that."
00:00:50.968,00:00:52.051,Not you.
00:00:53.679,00:00:56.097,"You get a full set of sleeves, all in a couple of months."
00:00:56.139,00:00:59.100,Takes guys a few years to get the ink you got.
00:01:00.268,00:01:02.312,I don't have a few years.
00:01:03.188,00:01:05.357,Wish to hell I did.
00:01:59.286,00:02:01.204,The vault. Open it.
00:02:01.246,00:02:03.958,We can't.
00:02:05.667,00:02:06.919,Where is he?
00:02:06.961,00:02:08.253,It's lunchtime.
00:02:08.295,00:02:09.379,White Castle?
00:02:09.421,00:02:10.631,It's a fast-food restaurant.
00:02:10.672,00:02:13.968,They serve those little square burgers.
00:02:14.509,00:02:15.094,I know what it is.
00:02:18.179,00:02:20.599,I'm not playing games.
00:02:20.641,00:02:23.184,"Sir, you have a half a million dollars cash in your bag."
00:02:23.226,00:02:25.145,Don't you think it would be better if...
00:02:35.238,00:02:37.074,OFFICER ON LOUDSPEAKER: This is the police.
00:02:37.116,00:02:39.118,You are completely surrounded.
00:02:42.245,00:02:43.163,Put down your weapon.
00:02:45.040,00:02:48.209,Put down your weapons now!
00:02:52.255,00:02:55.174,JUDGE: Rarely in the case of armed robbery do we hear a plea of No Contest.
00:02:56.259,00:02:58.470,"Are you sure about this, Mr. Scofield?"
00:02:58.512,00:03:00.263,"I'm sure, Your Honor."
00:03:00.305,00:03:02.016,"Your Honor, we'd like to recess if we could."
00:03:02.057,00:03:04.225,My client's a bit confused at the moment.
00:03:04.267,00:03:05.268,"I'm not, Your Honor."
00:03:05.310,00:03:07.104,"He is, Your Honor."
00:03:07.146,00:03:09.230,Perhaps you should heed your representation's advice.
00:03:09.272,00:03:11.025,Take some additional time to consider your response.
00:03:11.066,00:03:14.235,"I've already done that, Your Honor."
00:03:19.491,00:03:22.243,I'll retire to my chambers to determine sentencing.
00:03:22.285,00:03:24.412,Court's recessed until 1:30.
00:03:26.498,00:03:27.708,"Okay, come on, let's go."
00:03:27.749,00:03:30.209,Uncle Mike.
00:03:30.251,00:03:31.879,I didn't want you to come.
00:03:31.920,00:03:33.922,"Go home, LJ."
00:03:33.964,00:03:36.341,I didn't want you to see this.
00:03:44.307,00:03:45.642,He's not going to take this well.
00:03:45.684,00:03:47.268,Can you blame him?
00:03:47.310,00:03:51.982,He's beginning to get the idea that anybody he attaches himself to is going to end up in prison.
00:03:52.024,00:03:56.277,"And he's not the only one who is starting to feel that way, Michael."
00:03:56.319,00:03:57.445,Will you give us a minute?
00:03:57.487,00:03:58.613,GUARD: One minute.
00:03:59.406,00:04:01.282,Don't you understand?
00:04:01.324,00:04:05.286,You just put the book in that woman's hand and she's going to lob it at you like a grenade.
00:04:05.328,00:04:07.706,Justice and punishment are the same thing to her.
00:04:07.748,00:04:09.290,I know.
00:04:09.332,00:04:11.543,Then will you please tell me what's going through your head?
00:04:11.585,00:04:12.753,We've been over this.
00:04:12.794,00:04:14.254,I've known you my entire life.
00:04:14.295,00:04:16.464,You don't have a violent bone in your body.
00:04:16.506,00:04:18.258,And I know you didn't need the money.
00:04:18.299,00:04:19.300,Veronica.
00:04:19.342,00:04:21.302,Why won't you let me help you?
00:04:21.344,00:04:24.264,You've been good to me my whole life. You have.
00:04:25.473,00:04:27.267,"But you got to let me deal with this, okay?"
00:04:29.228,00:04:33.273,"Given your lack of prior criminal conduct, I am inclined toward probation."
00:04:33.314,00:04:39.905,"However, the fact that you discharged a deadly weapon during the commission of the crime suggests malice to me."
00:04:39.947,00:04:44.868,"For that reason, I find it incumbent that you see the inside of a prison cell, Mr. Scofield."
00:04:44.910,00:04:50.624,It says here that you've requested to be incarcerated somewhere near your home here in Chicago.
00:04:50.665,00:04:52.333,I'm willing to honor that.
00:04:52.375,00:04:53.877,The closest Level 1 facility to...
00:04:53.919,00:04:56.046,"That's maximum security, Your Honor."
00:04:56.088,00:04:59.841,I would ask counsel to refrain from interrupting me.
00:04:59.883,00:05:04.179,"As I was saying, the closest Level 1 facility would be Fox River State Penitentiary."
00:05:04.221,00:05:08.183,"As for the term of your sentence, I'm setting it at five years."
00:05:08.225,00:05:10.769,You'll be eligible for parole in half that time.
00:05:10.811,00:05:12.604,Sentence to be carried out immediately.
00:05:25.408,00:05:27.077,OFFICER 1: You people will step inside the door.
00:05:27.119,00:05:28.829,Check yourself for bugs.
00:05:28.870,00:05:29.871,"When you hear the knock, step out."
00:05:29.913,00:05:33.374,We ain't got all day to get this done.
00:05:33.416,00:05:34.960,No talking in line.
00:05:35.002,00:05:36.170,OFFICER 2: Go. Move it.
00:05:36.211,00:05:37.587,Keep that line moving.
00:05:37.629,00:05:39.673,Keep it moving.
00:05:39.714,00:05:40.257,"Move, move."
00:05:42.009,00:05:44.178,Next guy in the bank.
00:05:44.219,00:05:45.637,Name and back number.
00:05:45.679,00:05:47.889,"Scofield, Michael. 94941."
00:05:47.931,00:05:49.683,"You a religious man, Scofield?"
00:05:49.724,00:05:51.601,Never really thought about it.
00:05:51.601,00:05:53.061,"Good, 'cause the Ten Commandments don't mean a box of piss in here."
00:05:53.103,00:05:54.437,We got two commandments and two only.
00:05:54.479,00:05:56.857,The first commandment is you got nothing coming.
00:05:56.898,00:05:58.399,What's the second commandment?
00:05:58.441,00:06:00.401,See commandment Number 1.
00:06:00.443,00:06:02.403,Got you.
00:06:02.445,00:06:04.531,You talking out the side of your neck?
00:06:04.572,00:06:05.615,Come again?
00:06:05.657,00:06:07.242,"I said, are you being a smart ass?"
00:06:08.576,00:06:11.163,"I'm just trying to fly low, avoid the radar, boss."
00:06:11.205,00:06:13.248,Do my time and get out.
00:06:14.457,00:06:16.417,There isn't any flying under my radar.
00:06:17.085,00:06:18.586,Good to know.
00:06:39.398,00:06:40.775,"Hey, can a brother get some air-conditioning up here, cuz?"
00:06:40.817,00:06:43.820,"It's hotter than a crack ho's mouth, man."
00:06:43.862,00:06:48.033,"INMATE: Shit, to hell with the a.c., man."
00:06:54.122,00:06:56.415,"Yo, Fish, what you looking at?"
00:06:57.500,00:06:58.752,"You look kind of pretty to be up in here, man."
00:06:58.793,00:07:00.170,Fish!
00:07:02.505,00:07:03.965,"Suggest you take a seat, Fish."
00:07:05.633,00:07:08.387,Ain't nothing to do up in here but serve time.
00:07:08.427,00:07:10.097,Ain't nobody gonna serve it for you.
00:07:24.903,00:07:27.488,"Welcome to Prisneyland, Fish."
00:07:54.099,00:07:56.268,You want to talk about it?
00:07:56.310,00:07:57.727,It's not worth talking about.
00:07:57.769,00:07:59.020,"If it's keeping you up, it is."
00:07:59.062,00:08:01.398,It's just...
00:08:02.232,00:08:04.609,"It's nothing, you know."
00:08:04.651,00:08:06.278,Michael's case.
00:08:07.570,00:08:08.155,You did the best you could.
00:08:08.196,00:08:10.073,"Yeah, but he didn't."
00:08:11.825,00:08:14.411,He just sort of rolled over.
00:08:14.453,00:08:16.413,It is not like him. I...
00:08:17.747,00:08:19.791,I'm sorry.
00:08:19.833,00:08:22.543,"Hey, if it's on your mind, it's on your mind, right?"
00:08:24.629,00:08:26.840,Good night.
00:08:37.058,00:08:39.894,MAN ON P.A. SYSTEM: All lanes start coming out.
00:08:43.773,00:08:45.692,Trey Street Deuces got the hoops.
00:08:45.733,00:08:48.069,Nortenos got the bleachers.
00:08:48.820,00:08:50.447,Woods got the weight pile.
00:08:50.989,00:08:51.656,CO's got the rest.
00:08:53.616,00:08:56.786,"I'm telling you, the guards are the dirtiest gang in this whole place."
00:08:56.828,00:08:59.998,The only difference between us and them is the badge.
00:09:00.040,00:09:01.582,Who's the pet lover?
00:09:01.624,00:09:03.168,"He'll deny it, but he's D.B. Cooper."
00:09:03.210,00:09:06.796,"Parachuted out of a plane 30 years ago, with $1.5 million in cash."
00:09:07.630,00:09:09.049,Doesn't look like the type.
00:09:09.090,00:09:11.051,Who does?
00:09:11.092,00:09:12.177,"Hey, what up, Wholesale?"
00:09:12.219,00:09:13.803,You okay?
00:09:13.845,00:09:14.971,Yeah.
00:09:15.013,00:09:17.432,"What you doing with this fish, man?"
00:09:17.474,00:09:19.017,This my new cellie.
00:09:19.059,00:09:21.395,Wholesale's got it wired up at the commissary.
00:09:21.436,00:09:23.188,"Anything you want, he can get it for you."
00:09:23.230,00:09:24.772,"You keep handing out my jacket, I swear I'm gonna bust your grape."
00:09:24.814,00:09:28.402,"Man, you couldn't bust a grape in Napa with a set of cleats on."
00:09:28.443,00:09:30.820,What are you talking about?
00:09:30.862,00:09:32.655,"Oh, no, no."
00:09:59.640,00:10:00.767,I'm looking for someone.
00:10:02.852,00:10:04.645,A guy named Lincoln Burrows.
00:10:04.687,00:10:06.106,WHOLESALE: Linc the Sink?
00:10:06.147,00:10:07.607,Is that what they're calling him now?
00:10:07.648,00:10:09.443,Yeah.
00:10:09.484,00:10:12.279,"As in, he'll come at you with everything but the kitchen, snowflake."
00:10:12.946,00:10:15.656,Where can I find him?
00:10:15.698,00:10:17.617,SUCRE: Man killed the Vice President's brother.
00:10:17.658,00:10:18.952,"In a month, he's getting the chair."
00:10:18.993,00:10:23.164,Which means no one up this river is more dangerous than him 'cause he's got nothing to lose now.
00:10:23.206,00:10:25.333,"What are they gonna do, kill him twice?"
00:10:25.375,00:10:26.709,Is there a way I can get to him?
00:10:26.751,00:10:30.130,The only time those boys get out is for chapel and PI.
00:10:30.171,00:10:31.881,PI? What's that?
00:10:31.923,00:10:33.174,Prison Industry.
00:10:33.216,00:10:34.717,The guys that get along get to work.
00:10:34.759,00:10:38.638,"You know, painting, scrapping, making mattresses, you name it."
00:10:39.973,00:10:40.890,"I wouldn't get excited though if I were you, Fish."
00:10:40.932,00:10:43.184,You ain't sniffing none of PI.
00:10:43.226,00:10:44.644,Why is that?
00:10:44.685,00:10:46.146,'Cause John Abruzzi runs it.
00:10:47.188,00:10:48.189,John Abruzzi John Abruzzi?
00:10:48.231,00:10:49.983,John Abruzzi John Abruzzi.
00:10:51.234,00:10:53.653,Why you want to see Burrows so bad anyhow?
00:10:56.739,00:10:58.741,Because he's my brother.
00:11:21.764,00:11:22.723,LINCOLN: They denied the motion.
00:11:22.765,00:11:24.225,SCOFIELD: Then do it again.
00:11:24.267,00:11:26.269,That's it. May 11.
00:11:27.562,00:11:29.772,"That's the date they, you know, execute me."
00:11:29.814,00:11:31.983,I know.
00:11:37.656,00:11:39.366,"I didn't kill that man, Michael."
00:11:40.116,00:11:41.700,The evidence says you did.
00:11:41.742,00:11:44.621,"I don't care what the evidence says, I didn't kill him."
00:11:44.663,00:11:47.874,Swear to me.
00:11:47.915,00:11:49.000,"I swear to you, Michael."
00:11:56.049,00:11:57.884,But how did they get it wrong then?
00:11:57.925,00:11:59.177,"The courts, the appeals?"
00:11:59.219,00:12:01.221,Don't know. Don't know.
00:12:02.889,00:12:06.100,"All I keep thinking, looking back on it, is that I was set up."
00:12:06.142,00:12:09.728,And whoever it was that set me up wants me in the ground as quickly as possible.
00:12:15.360,00:12:17.070,What's another word for love?
00:12:17.111,00:12:18.697,What's the context?
00:12:18.737,00:12:23.784,"Oh, you know, the I love you so much I ain't never knocking over a liquor store again context."
00:12:23.826,00:12:25.786,"Except, you know, classy."
00:12:25.828,00:12:26.745,Hmm...
00:12:27.997,00:12:29.207,I'm proposing to my girl if you got to know.
00:12:29.249,00:12:30.709,In a letter?
00:12:30.749,00:12:31.710,You got a better way?
00:12:31.750,00:12:33.044,Face to face works pretty good.
00:12:33.086,00:12:35.838,This place ain't exactly the romantic spot.
00:12:35.880,00:12:38.799,I'm gonna have her get on the Staten Island Ferry.
00:12:38.841,00:12:42.970,"Then once she can see the Empire State Building, she opens the letter."
00:12:43.012,00:12:44.763,It's like almost being there.
00:12:45.223,00:12:47.892,Except for the fact that I won't be there.
00:12:47.934,00:12:49.269,Try passion.
00:12:49.310,00:12:51.812,"Ooh, ooh!"
00:12:51.854,00:12:52.939,Passion.
00:12:53.856,00:12:55.816,How do you spell that?
00:12:55.858,00:12:57.444,Is it P-A-S-H?
00:12:59.195,00:13:00.363,No H?
00:13:06.869,00:13:08.079,"LJ, hold up."
00:13:08.121,00:13:09.205,Hold up?
00:13:10.540,00:13:12.166,I don't know if I can go through with this.
00:13:12.208,00:13:14.461,Everything's gonna be fine.
00:13:14.502,00:13:14.919,Trust me.
00:13:19.591,00:13:20.717,Come on.
00:13:25.930,00:13:27.307,We understand each other then?
00:13:27.348,00:13:30.268,"Friday. Not Saturday, not Sunday. Friday."
00:13:30.310,00:13:32.061,It's totally understood.
00:13:32.103,00:13:34.147,"I don't want $100s, I don't want $5s, I don't want $1s."
00:13:34.188,00:13:36.357,"I know, I know."
00:13:45.784,00:13:47.826,It's on.
00:14:00.006,00:14:01.299,COP: Police!
00:14:24.698,00:14:27.158,"Abruzzi, I need you to hire me at PI."
00:14:28.951,00:14:30.203,Beat it.
00:14:31.412,00:14:33.247,Maybe you ought to hear what I got to say.
00:14:33.289,00:14:34.999,You got nothing I need.
00:14:36.917,00:14:37.877,Wouldn't be too sure of that.
00:14:38.919,00:14:41.088,My mistake.
00:14:41.964,00:14:43.924,Just what I need.
00:14:43.966,00:14:45.134,A duck.
00:14:45.968,00:14:47.679,"PI, Abruzzi."
00:14:47.721,00:14:50.598,You might find I can be of more assistance than you think.
00:14:52.975,00:14:54.394,Mull it over.
00:14:55.562,00:14:56.896,Come find me when you're ready to talk.
00:15:03.986,00:15:08.324,"All right, guys, pick it up."
00:15:08.366,00:15:08.908,Maggio.
00:15:15.915,00:15:17.751,"Yeah, so?"
00:15:17.792,00:15:20.837,That's the son of a bitch that fingered Abruzzi.
00:15:20.879,00:15:22.296,That's Fibonacci?
00:15:23.381,00:15:24.758,I thought the punk was gone forever.
00:15:24.799,00:15:26.967,Evidently somebody found him.
00:15:27.009,00:15:28.720,Somebody messing with us?
00:15:28.762,00:15:30.930,This you're not gonna believe.
00:15:35.142,00:15:36.477,What is it?
00:15:41.399,00:15:44.193,Tattoo looks fresh.
00:15:45.612,00:15:47.947,"I guess being a diabetic, you don't mind needles."
00:15:48.782,00:15:50.032,"I'm Michael, by the way."
00:15:50.074,00:15:52.076,Scofield.
00:15:52.118,00:15:52.993,And you are?
00:15:53.035,00:15:54.995,Dr. Tancredi will do.
00:15:55.037,00:15:57.123,Tancredi like the Governor?
00:15:59.083,00:16:01.294,"You're not related, are you?"
00:16:03.045,00:16:08.008,Wouldn't think you'd find the daughter of Frontier Justice Frank working in a prison.
00:16:08.050,00:16:10.010,As a doctor no less.
00:16:10.052,00:16:13.306,"I believe in being part of the solution, not the problem."
00:16:15.099,00:16:21.314,Be the change you want to see in the world.
00:16:21.355,00:16:22.607,What?
00:16:24.400,00:16:26.527,Nothing. That was just my senior quote.
00:16:26.569,00:16:27.737,That was you?
00:16:27.779,00:16:30.114,This whole time I was thinking it was Gandhi.
00:16:30.156,00:16:31.866,You're very funny.
00:16:32.158,00:16:33.409,Sit tight.
00:16:33.451,00:16:35.578,Put direct pressure on that.
00:16:49.592,00:16:53.930,"So, how do we play this?"
00:16:53.972,00:16:56.307,Nice try.
00:16:57.600,00:16:59.519,I'm the farthest thing from a junkie. Trust me.
00:16:59.560,00:17:01.061,"I got news for you, Michael."
00:17:01.103,00:17:03.690,Trust me means absolutely zero inside these walls.
00:17:03.731,00:17:07.527,The only way you're getting that insulin is if I'm administering it.
00:17:07.568,00:17:10.404,I guess we'll be seeing a lot of each other then.
00:17:10.446,00:17:11.447,I guess so.
00:17:23.793,00:17:27.087,We're all clear on the Burrows execution.
00:17:27.129,00:17:29.883,Except for one thing.
00:17:33.260,00:17:35.722,He's got a lot of influence with the Governor.
00:17:36.973,00:17:38.224,They went to prep school together apparently.
00:17:39.141,00:17:44.772,"Look, the closer it gets, the more I'm worried that the bottom is gonna fall out of this whole thing."
00:17:49.151,00:17:52.446,Maybe it's time you arranged a visit with the good bishop then.
00:17:53.531,00:17:56.951,"Look, in one month it'll all be over."
00:17:58.494,00:18:05.501,"The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again."
00:18:05.543,00:18:09.005,"And they remembered his words, and so should you."
00:18:10.214,00:18:13.092,"Good day, gentlemen."
00:18:18.138,00:18:20.099,"OFFICER 1: Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go."
00:18:25.104,00:18:26.272,Michael?
00:18:27.690,00:18:30.150,OFFICER 2: Let's go.
00:18:31.569,00:18:33.654,Why?
00:18:33.696,00:18:36.240,I'm getting you out of here.
00:18:36.282,00:18:39.118,"Burrows, roll it up."
00:18:39.619,00:18:41.037,It's impossible.
00:18:41.079,00:18:43.122,"Not if you designed the place, it isn't."
00:18:50.713,00:18:52.882,VERONICA: Too formal.
00:18:55.342,00:18:56.886,Too greeting card.
00:18:58.304,00:19:00.264,"Well, we got to make a decision sooner or later, you know."
00:19:00.306,00:19:01.432,We have time.
00:19:01.474,00:19:03.851,"We don't, actually."
00:19:03.893,00:19:08.230,"I mean, at some point, we got to pull the trigger on this thing."
00:19:08.272,00:19:09.523,I don't want to rush this.
00:19:09.565,00:19:12.443,We're only gonna do it once.
00:19:16.656,00:19:20.242,"Honey, can I ask you something?"
00:19:20.284,00:19:21.410,Of course.
00:19:22.495,00:19:23.913,Are you putting this off?
00:19:23.955,00:19:25.205,What do you mean?
00:19:25.247,00:19:26.916,"I mean, are you having second thoughts?"
00:19:26.958,00:19:27.959,No.
00:19:29.251,00:19:30.753,"Honey, no. I'm not."
00:19:32.254,00:19:35.299,"I don't know, but I just can't help thinking this is about..."
00:19:35.341,00:19:38.218,It's not.
00:19:38.260,00:19:42.098,"I love you, and I want to be your wife."
00:19:46.477,00:19:48.228,Passion?
00:19:48.270,00:19:49.897,"Hey, you went for it."
00:19:49.939,00:19:53.233,She probably thinks I went sissy up in here. Passion.
00:19:53.275,00:19:56.445,"You know, got more than one syllable, too much talking."
00:19:56.487,00:19:58.364,That's me from now on.
00:19:58.405,00:19:59.991,Yes. No.
00:20:00.033,00:20:01.909,Love. Hate.
00:20:01.951,00:20:03.243,Love.
00:20:03.285,00:20:06.288,Are you kidding?
00:20:06.330,00:20:10.417,That doesn't take time.
00:20:12.753,00:20:15.840,She's supposed to come around for a conjugal on Tuesday.
00:20:15.882,00:20:19.426,"She's always calling me beforehand, letting me know she's coming."
00:20:19.468,00:20:21.721,"This time, man, I ain't heard a peep."
00:20:22.930,00:20:24.431,You spooked her.
00:20:25.850,00:20:27.643,"Scofield, get it together."
00:20:31.731,00:20:33.440,"No good, Fish."
00:20:33.482,00:20:36.443,No one gets an audience with the Pope.
00:20:36.485,00:20:39.697,Not unless he's real interested in what you got going on.
00:20:40.698,00:20:42.449,POPE: Top of your class at Loyola.
00:20:42.491,00:20:44.284,"Magna cum laude, in fact."
00:20:46.245,00:20:52.085,I can't help wondering what someone with your credentials is doing in a place like this.
00:20:52.126,00:20:54.587,"Took a wrong turn a few months back, I guess."
00:20:54.628,00:20:56.881,You make it sound like a traffic infraction.
00:20:56.923,00:20:59.633,Like all you did was turn the wrong way up a one-way street.
00:20:59.675,00:21:02.220,"Everyone turns up one, sooner or later."
00:21:05.389,00:21:13.272,"The reason I called you here, I noticed in your I-file, under occupation, you put down unemployed."
00:21:14.314,00:21:18.444,"That's not true now, is it?"
00:21:18.485,00:21:20.738,"I know you're a structural engineer, Scofield."
00:21:25.284,00:21:30.414,Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal as a monument to his undying love for his wife.
00:21:31.498,00:21:34.168,My wife is quite fond of the story.
00:21:34.210,00:21:37.630,It appeals to the romantic in her.
00:21:37.671,00:21:42.342,"Being married to someone in Corrections, terrible job."
00:21:42.384,00:21:44.344,Wouldn't wish it on anyone.
00:21:44.386,00:21:48.641,"And yet, in 39 years, my wife has never complained."
00:21:50.101,00:21:52.519,"And the worst part of it is, I've never thanked her."
00:21:54.354,00:21:58.484,"So, because I couldn't say it, I thought, you know, I could build it."
00:22:00.402,00:22:03.322,"Come June, it's our 40th anniversary."
00:22:05.324,00:22:06.659,"But, here, look."
00:22:07.868,00:22:13.874,"You see, the problem is, I build any more, it's all gonna come down like a house of cards."
00:22:13.916,00:22:17.377,That's where I was hoping you could be of assistance.
00:22:17.419,00:22:23.342,"And for the favor, I can offer you three days of work a week in here, and it'll keep you off the yard."
00:22:30.432,00:22:31.600,I can't do it.
00:22:32.893,00:22:40.526,"Son, it's better for me to owe you one in here than it is for you to owe me one, I can promise you that."
00:22:40.567,00:22:42.360,I'll take my chances.
00:22:45.281,00:22:46.532,Then we're through here.
00:22:46.573,00:22:48.617,Guard!
00:22:50.577,00:22:53.371,Two pounds of pot?
00:22:54.456,00:22:56.625,"What were you trying to do, set a record?"
00:22:56.667,00:22:59.670,"It's not funny, LJ."
00:23:01.463,00:23:04.550,It's pretty obvious to me you need some guidance.
00:23:04.591,00:23:05.676,Hey.
00:23:07.594,00:23:08.554,Thanks.
00:23:11.307,00:23:12.599,From who?
00:23:12.641,00:23:14.434,Give him a chance.
00:23:14.476,00:23:15.644,We got nothing in common.
00:23:15.686,00:23:18.814,"Oh, where's this coming from, LJ?"
00:23:18.856,00:23:22.400,"Last semester, you were getting almost all A's and now..."
00:23:25.487,00:23:26.530,"It's your father, isn't it?"
00:23:26.572,00:23:28.448,I don't have a father.
00:23:28.490,00:23:30.701,"It wasn't an immaculate conception, honey, trust me."
00:23:34.788,00:23:36.623,Maybe it's time we went and saw him.
00:23:36.665,00:23:38.959,Mom.
00:23:39.001,00:23:40.211,Ma.
00:23:40.502,00:23:42.338,Don't.
00:23:42.380,00:23:44.965,"I'm about as excited by the prospect as you are, but something's got to give."
00:23:45.007,00:23:47.425,You have got too much potential to be screwing up your life like this.
00:23:51.597,00:23:55.601,VERONICA: What if they'd sent you to Taylorville or Marion and not here?
00:23:57.228,00:23:59.021,I think I'd be doing the same thing I'm doing in here.
00:23:59.063,00:24:01.439,"Eating Jell-O, drinking Kool-Aid."
00:24:01.481,00:24:03.483,I know what you're doing.
00:24:03.525,00:24:06.486,It's not the luck of the draw that you're in here with Lincoln.
00:24:06.528,00:24:09.489,"You forget I know you, both of you."
00:24:09.531,00:24:13.035,You two have the most dysfunctional idea of love I've ever seen.
00:24:13.077,00:24:18.416,"What, he beats you up to keep you off the streets, so you get yourself tossed into Fox River with him?"
00:24:18.456,00:24:19.750,To what? Save him?
00:24:23.421,00:24:26.048,I deserve to know.
00:24:26.090,00:24:28.508,"Past tense for you, maybe. Not me."
00:24:28.550,00:24:33.555,I gave him a shot when I got back from college. I did.
00:24:33.597,00:24:36.600,"Even with all the stuff that was going on with him, I did everything I could to make it work and he threw it away."
00:24:36.642,00:24:39.603,You ever think maybe he was hurt that you left in the first place?
00:24:40.562,00:24:42.815,Don't do this.
00:24:42.856,00:24:45.651,"Whatever it is you're doing, don't do it."
00:24:45.692,00:24:47.069,I'm already appealing your case.
00:24:47.111,00:24:48.404,I told you to leave that alone.
00:24:48.446,00:24:50.323,I've gotten in touch with the diocese about Lincoln.
00:24:50.364,00:24:51.531,The bishop may be able to help.
00:24:51.573,00:24:53.451,That won't stop it.
00:24:57.788,00:24:59.039,You want to do something?
00:24:59.081,00:25:00.582,You find out who's trying to bury him.
00:25:04.378,00:25:05.587,Nobody's trying to bury him.
00:25:05.629,00:25:07.798,The evidence was there.
00:25:07.840,00:25:08.632,The evidence was cooked.
00:25:11.593,00:25:13.595,GUARD: Visiting hours are now over.
00:25:19.685,00:25:20.769,Take care of yourself.
00:25:23.563,00:25:25.149,"Someone wants him dead, Veronica."
00:25:25.191,00:25:27.567,Something more is going on here.
00:25:27.609,00:25:31.322,"This is desperation, Michael."
00:25:31.364,00:25:32.198,You're in denial.
00:25:32.239,00:25:34.574,But I can't watch him die.
00:25:34.616,00:25:36.160,I won't do that.
00:26:05.856,00:26:07.733,Gentlemen.
00:26:07.774,00:26:10.568,What is it about the Burrows situation that I can help you with?
00:26:10.610,00:26:14.572,It's our understanding that you have great influence with the Governor.
00:26:14.614,00:26:18.744,I wouldn't say it's great or influence.
00:26:18.785,00:26:22.206,It's also our understanding that you oppose the death penalty.
00:26:22.248,00:26:24.333,I'm a man of God.
00:26:24.375,00:26:27.336,"In this case, we're hoping you'll suspend that position."
00:26:27.378,00:26:28.879,At least temporarily.
00:26:30.172,00:26:34.634,"If the inmate appeals to me for intervention, how can I turn my back on him?"
00:26:34.676,00:26:37.637,You have a habit of answering a question with a question.
00:26:37.679,00:26:41.475,And you have a way of asking questions that beg more questions.
00:26:45.771,00:26:47.147,Are you saying you won't do it?
00:26:47.189,00:26:49.275,I'm not a man to equivocate.
00:26:52.736,00:26:55.822,"You're what, 62 years old now, Your Excellency."
00:26:55.864,00:26:57.241,That's right.
00:26:57.283,00:27:00.369,I would assume then that you'd be well-versed in how our government's tax system works.
00:27:00.411,00:27:04.206,Taking personal capital gains under the church's tax shelter...
00:27:05.458,00:27:06.750,"That'd be fraud, wouldn't it, Your Excellency?"
00:27:08.127,00:27:10.754,I will not be cowed into forsaking my beliefs.
00:27:12.214,00:27:13.631,Not by you or anyone else.
00:27:15.217,00:27:16.676,Admirable.
00:27:16.718,00:27:19.472,"Good day, Your Excellency."
00:27:19.930,00:27:22.891,Mr. Kellerman.
00:27:22.933,00:27:26.895,What is it about this case that the Secret Service is so interested in?
00:27:26.937,00:27:28.646,The man killed the Vice President's brother.
00:27:37.239,00:27:38.782,What did you say?
00:27:39.657,00:27:40.909,Someone found Fibonacci.
00:27:41.994,00:27:43.162,I'm looking at the photos right now.
00:27:43.203,00:27:46.999,"Son of a bitch has got a beard, sunglasses, Witness Protection if I ever saw it."
00:27:47.749,00:27:49.084,Who was this someone?
00:27:49.126,00:27:51.962,I don't know.
00:27:52.004,00:27:56.674,Just...this folded-up bird made of paper.
00:27:59.345,00:28:00.720,Like origami?
00:28:00.762,00:28:01.639,"Yeah, like that."
00:28:01.679,00:28:03.723,Like origami.
00:28:38.133,00:28:40.135,"You're Charles Westmoreland, right?"
00:28:40.177,00:28:41.261,Do I know you?
00:28:41.303,00:28:42.721,Knew your wife before she passed.
00:28:44.097,00:28:45.265,You knew Marla?
00:28:45.307,00:28:46.308,You mean Ann?
00:28:47.309,00:28:48.185,How'd you know her?
00:28:48.227,00:28:49.562,We taught together in Boston.
00:28:49.603,00:28:50.770,East Farmington.
00:28:50.812,00:28:52.772,You mean West Wilmington?
00:28:54.358,00:28:56.985,"No more tests, I promise."
00:28:58.028,00:29:00.864,Seems you know everything about me.
00:29:00.906,00:29:02.700,Who are you?
00:29:02.741,00:29:04.784,How'd you get it in here?
00:29:05.827,00:29:07.204,"First off, she's not an it."
00:29:08.330,00:29:14.878,"She's Marilyn, and she's grandfathered back from the days when prisoners were allowed a creature comfort or two."
00:29:14.920,00:29:17.005,Heard you were D.B. Cooper.
00:29:18.549,00:29:24.263,"Every new fish comes in here, first thing they hear is that Charles Westmoreland's D.B. Cooper."
00:29:24.304,00:29:26.765,I'll tell you like I tell them.
00:29:27.807,00:29:29.727,You want the Cooper story?
00:29:29.768,00:29:31.770,I can't give it to you 'cause I'm not him.
00:29:32.854,00:29:35.566,That's too bad.
00:29:35.982,00:29:37.568,Man's a legend.
00:29:37.610,00:29:40.195,"Nowhere near as much as I wish it were true, friend."
00:29:40.237,00:29:43.031,I'd have $1.5 million waiting for me on the outside.
00:29:46.243,00:29:48.787,I'd put some grass under them if I were you.
00:29:50.414,00:29:53.250,This thing would go a whole lot easier if you'd just hire me.
00:29:53.292,00:29:55.210,What is this all about?
00:29:56.587,00:29:58.964,Say you were able to get outside those walls.
00:29:59.005,00:30:01.967,Would you have the people in place to make sure you disappeared forever?
00:30:02.008,00:30:02.801,What do you care?
00:30:02.842,00:30:04.637,Just curious.
00:30:05.178,00:30:06.346,Where's Fibonacci?
00:30:06.388,00:30:08.223,That's not the way it works.
00:30:13.437,00:30:16.189,"They come at me, John, I'm coming after you."
00:30:17.149,00:30:18.108,I doubt it.
00:30:44.718,00:30:47.012,All right.
00:30:50.307,00:30:53.143,OFFICER 1: On the ground!
00:30:53.185,00:30:54.770,OFFICER 2: Get on the ground!
00:30:56.146,00:30:58.231,"I totally misjudged you, Scofield."
00:30:58.273,00:31:01.151,I didn't think you were the agitating type.
00:31:01.193,00:31:03.903,Behavior like that will not be tolerated in my prison.
00:31:03.945,00:31:05.739,90 days in the SHU.
00:31:05.781,00:31:07.449,That ought to be enough time to convince you of that fact.
00:31:07.491,00:31:09.159,90 days?
00:31:17.167,00:31:19.503,Something you want to say?
00:31:19.545,00:31:21.004,It's just...
00:31:22.214,00:31:23.923,I'm not of much value to you in the SHU.
00:31:23.965,00:31:25.133,Value?
00:31:25.175,00:31:26.802,Hmm. The Taj.
00:31:28.261,00:31:31.139,It'd be a shame for the eighth wonder of the modern world to collapse because the stress isn't properly propagated.
00:31:31.181,00:31:33.141,Properly propagated?
00:31:33.183,00:31:34.893,Properly propagated.
00:31:35.728,00:31:36.936,The joints are overloaded.
00:31:36.978,00:31:41.441,They won't provide anywhere near the sheer strength the completed structure will need.
00:31:41.483,00:31:44.319,How much work are we talking?
00:31:44.361,00:31:45.945,"You want it by when, June?"
00:31:45.987,00:31:47.113,Yes.
00:31:47.155,00:31:49.991,"Then we better get started, wouldn't you say?"
00:32:17.018,00:32:18.937,Who's there?
00:32:35.287,00:32:38.290,Bishop McMorrow was killed last night.
00:32:38.331,00:32:40.125,Someone shot him while he was sleeping.
00:32:40.166,00:32:43.128,I thought you'd want to know.
00:32:43.587,00:32:44.963,Thanks.
00:32:52.053,00:32:53.472,Michael was right.
00:33:23.251,00:33:25.253,"Sink, you got a visitor."
00:33:37.307,00:33:39.142,He was arrested.
00:33:40.936,00:33:42.061,For what?
00:33:42.103,00:33:43.355,Possession of marijuana.
00:33:46.483,00:33:49.361,I figured he could use some fatherly advice before it's...
00:33:51.237,00:33:52.280,Gone forever?
00:33:52.322,00:33:53.448,I didn't mean that.
00:33:53.490,00:33:56.034,I know you didn't.
00:33:57.160,00:33:58.370,Sit down.
00:34:04.083,00:34:05.335,"Dope, huh?"
00:34:05.377,00:34:07.045,Using or dealing?
00:34:07.796,00:34:10.089,What's the difference?
00:34:10.131,00:34:13.301,Then what?
00:34:15.261,00:34:17.848,You got a piece of the good life.
00:34:18.724,00:34:21.309,"Look, I get it, the whole thing."
00:34:22.143,00:34:26.523,"She drags me in here, you give me a big speech, I walk away a changed man."
00:34:26.565,00:34:31.152,"Straight A's, Harvard, grow up and be a dentist."
00:34:32.153,00:34:33.279,It's better than being here.
00:34:35.114,00:34:38.827,You got to realize who's getting punished when you're doing the things you're doing.
00:34:38.869,00:34:39.494,You think it's me.
00:34:39.536,00:34:41.914,I did the same thing.
00:34:41.955,00:34:45.542,Punished the old man 'cause he was gone.
00:34:48.754,00:34:52.257,I'm not asking you to love me.
00:34:52.298,00:34:53.383,I already screwed up that chance long ago.
00:34:53.425,00:34:56.386,I'm asking you to love yourself.
00:34:56.428,00:34:59.056,You can still put the brakes on this thing.
00:35:00.766,00:35:02.350,"So, that's what fatherly advice is like."
00:35:04.185,00:35:05.395,Where are you going?
00:35:05.437,00:35:08.106,I got homework.
00:35:09.232,00:35:11.192,"They're putting me to death, LJ."
00:35:11.234,00:35:13.111,"In a month's time, I'll be dead."
00:35:13.779,00:35:15.113,You get that?
00:35:16.489,00:35:18.283,You're already dead to me.
00:35:43.475,00:35:44.225,Yes.
00:35:44.267,00:35:48.396,"W-What? You mean, yes yes?"
00:35:48.438,00:35:50.189,"Yes, yes!"
00:35:52.317,00:35:55.361,There's just one thing.
00:35:55.403,00:35:56.863,Mama wants us to wait till you get out.
00:35:56.905,00:35:58.573,"Of course, mi amor."
00:35:58.615,00:36:00.199,Only we have to get married in a church.
00:36:00.241,00:36:01.910,A Catholic church.
00:36:01.952,00:36:05.080,"Wouldn't want to mess with the Catholic roots, would we?"
00:36:10.502,00:36:12.211,You went to Loyola.
00:36:12.253,00:36:13.212,You've been checking up on me.
00:36:13.254,00:36:14.923,I like to get to know my patients.
00:36:14.965,00:36:17.592,I went to Northwestern.
00:36:17.634,00:36:21.387,Maybe we met before.
00:36:21.429,00:36:23.140,I would've remembered.
00:36:23.181,00:36:24.182,That a compliment?
00:36:25.475,00:36:27.727,Hmm.
00:36:27.769,00:36:29.228,What?
00:36:29.270,00:36:31.272,Your blood glucose is at 50 milligrams per deciliter.
00:36:31.314,00:36:32.440,So?
00:36:32.482,00:36:34.233,It's hypoglycemic.
00:36:34.275,00:36:36.611,Your body's reacting to the insulin like you're not a diabetic.
00:36:36.653,00:36:38.697,You sure it's Type I diabetes you got?
00:36:38.738,00:36:41.240,Ever since I was a kid.
00:36:41.282,00:36:44.243,"All right. Not experiencing any tingling sensation, cold sweats?"
00:36:48.498,00:36:49.457,Infirmary.
00:36:50.291,00:36:51.501,Yes.
00:36:52.418,00:36:54.420,"Yeah, I did."
00:36:54.462,00:36:57.423,"No, I did and I do."
00:36:58.758,00:37:00.052,Okay.
00:37:01.302,00:37:03.262,"Great. Well, I'll call him after lunch then. Thanks."
00:37:03.304,00:37:04.430,I'm with a patient. Okay.
00:37:04.472,00:37:08.018,I'd like to run some tests next time you're in.
00:37:08.060,00:37:11.563,Last thing I want is to be administering insulin to a man who doesn't need it.
00:37:11.604,00:37:13.231,"Yeah, sure."
00:37:13.523,00:37:14.733,Okay.
00:37:21.614,00:37:23.282,How'd you get here by the way?
00:37:23.324,00:37:25.243,"Oh, you know."
00:37:26.327,00:37:28.371,I don't.
00:37:28.413,00:37:30.289,You know. Hector.
00:37:30.331,00:37:30.373,What?
00:37:32.084,00:37:35.128,"I didn't have any money for the bus, so he offered me a ride."
00:37:35.170,00:37:36.462,He was really sweet.
00:37:37.338,00:37:39.966,"Honey, he's just a friend."
00:37:40.008,00:37:41.300,"No, he's not just a friend."
00:37:41.342,00:37:43.261,I know Hector.
00:37:43.302,00:37:44.846,Men and women can't be friends.
00:37:44.888,00:37:48.683,A guy doesn't drive a girl 500 miles across state lines because he wants to be friends.
00:37:48.725,00:37:50.309,"GUARD: Casanova, wrap it up."
00:37:51.603,00:37:54.355,"Hey, you got nothing to worry about, okay?"
00:37:54.397,00:37:56.357,It's you I'm marrying.
00:37:56.399,00:37:59.277,It's not you I'm worried about.
00:38:01.738,00:38:03.281,16 more months.
00:38:12.373,00:38:13.291,I love you.
00:38:24.844,00:38:27.305,"Be easy, son, all right?"
00:38:32.894,00:38:35.438,Sucre tells me you're the local pharmacy.
00:38:39.358,00:38:40.359,"What you need, man?"
00:38:40.401,00:38:41.360,PUGNAc.
00:38:41.402,00:38:43.446,"I only speak English, white boy."
00:38:43.488,00:38:45.364,It's an insulin blocker.
00:38:45.406,00:38:47.450,Standard over-the-counter variety you can get at any pharmacy.
00:38:47.492,00:38:49.368,You can get that at Medical then.
00:38:49.410,00:38:50.745,I can't get that at Medical.
00:38:50.787,00:38:52.371,Why not?
00:38:52.413,00:38:55.374,Because they're already giving me insulin shots.
00:38:55.416,00:38:58.544,"You're one mixed-up cracker, you know that?"
00:38:58.586,00:39:00.379,Can you get it for me or not?
00:39:00.421,00:39:06.385,Only if you tell me why is it you want to keep going back up to Medical to get an insulin shot which you don't need.
00:39:06.427,00:39:09.014,I like the ambience.
00:39:10.431,00:39:11.390,Are we in business?
00:39:26.614,00:39:28.366,Scofield.
00:39:28.407,00:39:31.410,"I don't know what you did, but Abruzzi wanted me to give you this PI card."
00:39:31.452,00:39:35.915,Congratulations.
00:39:52.849,00:39:54.142,"Kudos, Fish."
00:39:54.184,00:39:55.560,You got spine.
00:40:01.524,00:40:03.860,"GUARD: All right, cons, break it down!"
00:40:06.196,00:40:07.405,"ABRUZZI: Move it, guys."
00:40:19.500,00:40:21.460,Saw Veronica came by yesterday.
00:40:21.502,00:40:22.712,Still engaged to that guy?
00:40:22.754,00:40:23.838,Yep.
00:40:24.505,00:40:25.506,Could've been me.
00:40:25.548,00:40:27.425,If you hadn't self-destructed.
00:40:28.509,00:40:30.803,You think I meant to knock up Lisa Rix?
00:40:31.637,00:40:33.431,I was just being stupid. Hurt.
00:40:34.515,00:40:36.642,"Shouldn't have pushed her away, though."
00:40:36.684,00:40:38.561,You pushed everyone away.
00:40:40.105,00:40:42.774,I'm an anchor.
00:40:48.529,00:40:49.822,Why did you hire him?
00:40:49.864,00:40:52.450,"Keep your friends close, your enemies closer."
00:40:58.539,00:41:00.708,You mean what you said earlier?
00:41:00.750,00:41:02.460,"I'm not here on vacation, trust me."
00:41:04.003,00:41:07.006,Getting outside these walls is just the beginning.
00:41:07.048,00:41:08.549,You're gonna need money.
00:41:11.761,00:41:13.512,I'll have it.
00:41:13.554,00:41:16.641,And people on the outside.
00:41:16.682,00:41:17.558,People that can help you disappear.
00:41:17.600,00:41:20.061,I've already got them.
00:41:20.103,00:41:21.896,They just don't know it yet.
00:41:26.943,00:41:31.948,"Look, whatever you got going on, fill me in 'cause I'm in the dark here."
00:41:31.990,00:41:36.494,Chaparral Associates got the contract to retrofit this place in '99.
00:41:36.535,00:41:38.121,$4 million contract.
00:41:38.163,00:41:41.166,"Head partner couldn't crack it, so he subcontracted out."
00:41:41.207,00:41:43.542,An under-the-table sort of deal with a former associate.
00:41:43.584,00:41:46.504,That guy was one of the partners in my firm.
00:41:48.298,00:41:50.549,We basically ghostwrote the whole plan.
00:41:50.591,00:41:53.928,"Crossed the t's, dotted the i's, grouted the tiles."
00:42:02.395,00:42:04.022,You've seen the blueprints.
00:42:04.063,00:42:05.523,Better than that.
00:42:06.358,00:42:07.608,I've got them on me.
00:42:11.821,00:42:13.281,Are you kidding me?
00:42:16.617,00:42:19.578,Am I supposed to be seeing something here?
00:42:19.620,00:42:20.288,Look closer.
00:00:01.460,00:00:08.258,"Previously on Prison Break: JUDGE: I find it incumbent that you see the inside of a prison cell, Mr. Scofield."
00:00:08.258,00:00:09.593,"MAN: Why do you want to see Burrows so bad, anyhow?"
00:00:09.593,00:00:12.095,Because he's my brother.
00:00:12.095,00:00:14.473,VERONICA: So you get yourself tossed into Fox River with him?
00:00:14.473,00:00:17.100,To what... save him?
00:00:17.100,00:00:20.228,"...and whoever it was that set me up, wants me in the ground as quickly was possible."
00:00:20.228,00:00:24.232,"Look, the closer it gets, the more I'm worried that the bottom is gonna fall out of this whole thing."
00:00:24.232,00:00:26.902,That's the son of a bitch that fingered Abruzzi.
00:00:26.902,00:00:28.111,MAGGIO: Someone found Fibanacci.
00:00:28.111,00:00:29.571,Who was this someone?
00:00:29.571,00:00:30.948,Why'd you hire him?
00:00:30.948,00:00:34.618,Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
00:00:34.618,00:00:35.744,"Hey, come at me, John."
00:00:35.744,00:00:37.120,I'm coming after you.
00:00:37.120,00:00:38.706,I doubt it.
00:00:40.833,00:00:42.626,I'm getting you out of here.
00:00:42.626,00:00:45.004,It's impossible.
00:00:45.004,00:00:46.254,You've seen the blueprints.
00:00:46.254,00:00:48.549,Better than that.
00:00:48.549,00:00:52.135,I've got them on me.
00:01:05.106,00:01:07.985,"You're anticipating every one of my moves, three moves in advance."
00:01:07.985,00:01:11.238,"You're a hell of a strategist, Fish."
00:01:11.238,00:01:12.948,You ever think about Boston?
00:01:12.948,00:01:14.408,Sure.
00:01:12.948,00:01:15.450,Think you'll ever see it again?
00:01:15.450,00:01:19.246,I'm a 60-year-old man with 60 years left on my ticket.
00:01:19.246,00:01:20.455,What do you think?
00:01:20.455,00:01:21.707,I'm thinking about going.
00:01:21.707,00:01:25.544,"Well, there's goin' and there's goin'."
00:01:25.544,00:01:26.837,Which one you mean?
00:01:26.837,00:01:28.881,The one you think I mean.
00:01:33.052,00:01:38.306,"Three days inside, and he's already thinking about turning rabbit."
00:01:38.306,00:01:39.600,It'll pass.
00:01:39.600,00:01:41.852,It always does.
00:01:41.852,00:01:44.813,There's bigger things to worry about at the moment.
00:01:44.813,00:01:47.232,I've been in here long enough to know it when I see it.
00:01:47.232,00:01:49.568,The calm before the storm.
00:01:49.568,00:01:53.739,Whites and blacks are going at each other real soon here.
00:01:53.739,00:01:57.367,"Everybody chooses sides, and a lot of guys bleed."
00:01:57.367,00:01:58.953,There a reason?
00:01:58.953,00:02:02.163,Same reason you don't put cats and dogs in the same cage.
00:02:02.163,00:02:05.166,They don't get along.
00:02:32.987,00:02:34.738,Hmm.
00:02:34.738,00:02:36.448,What?
00:02:36.448,00:02:37.825,So?
00:02:37.825,00:02:41.787,"Means only one thing-- Shakedown, ladies! Shakedown!"
00:02:42.830,00:02:45.540,All contraband will be confiscated.
00:02:45.540,00:02:49.168,"The DIRT shuts off the water, so you can't flush your contraband."
00:02:49.878,00:02:50.796,Says you!
00:02:56.384,00:02:57.176,Under the table...
00:03:00.848,00:03:03.809,What the hell is this?
00:03:03.809,00:03:04.810,"Insurance, white boy."
00:03:04.810,00:03:06.353,"Now, dump it!"
00:03:10.315,00:03:12.191,Open it.
00:03:15.236,00:03:16.822,So...
00:03:16.822,00:03:19.491,"tooling up for the race riot, are we?"
00:03:19.491,00:03:22.119,Hand it over.
00:03:24.955,00:03:27.082,Rugheads and the billies.
00:03:27.082,00:03:30.502,"Now, which side are you on anyhow, Fish?"
00:03:30.502,00:03:31.628,"That would be neither, boss."
00:03:31.628,00:03:34.506,Maybe you're gonna go extracurricular with it then.
00:03:34.506,00:03:36.008,"Stick a C.O., maybe."
00:03:37.258,00:03:38.468,"THE POPE: Is there a problem here, Deputy?"
00:03:38.468,00:03:41.763,Got a shank in here.
00:03:42.806,00:03:44.432,Is this yours?
00:03:53.067,00:03:55.569,You're not a good liar.
00:03:55.569,00:03:57.529,"Come on, Sucre, you're going to the SHU."
00:04:05.204,00:04:06.287,"Move along, Deputy."
00:04:06.287,00:04:08.289,I'm not done shaking this cell down yet.
00:04:08.289,00:04:10.042,I said move along.
00:04:13.712,00:04:15.797,"In the old man's back pocket, are you?"
00:04:15.797,00:04:17.841,"Well, I got news for you, Fish."
00:04:17.841,00:04:22.345,"He may run this place during the day, but I run it during the night."
00:05:04.512,00:05:06.598,"LINCOLN: What the hell were you thinking, Michael?"
00:05:08.391,00:05:10.227,How we doing it?
00:05:10.227,00:05:12.687,The infirmary.
00:05:12.687,00:05:14.982,Infirmary?
00:05:14.982,00:05:17.692,It's the weakest link in the security chain.
00:05:17.692,00:05:21.071,"As long as I get that PUGNAc, I'll get all the access I need."
00:05:21.071,00:05:22.489,What the hell's a PUGNAc?
00:05:22.489,00:05:25.909,It lowers my insulin levels to the point that I'm hyperglycemic.
00:05:25.909,00:05:30.330,"As long as the good doctor thinks I'm diabetic, I'll have plenty of time in there to do what I need to do."
00:05:30.330,00:05:31.372,Which is?
00:05:31.372,00:05:32.373,A little work.
00:05:32.373,00:05:34.668,A little prep for your arrival.
00:05:34.668,00:05:36.419,"That's the idea, anyway."
00:05:36.419,00:05:37.921,The idea?
00:05:37.921,00:05:40.966,"There's a little hitch in getting the PUGNAc, that's all."
00:05:40.966,00:05:42.801,They don't exactly stock it at the commissary.
00:05:42.801,00:05:45.179,You're telling me this whole thing's riding on a bunch of pills.
00:05:45.179,00:05:46.305,Someone's working on it as we speak.
00:05:50.309,00:05:54.855,"Now's not the time to be trusting a black inmate, Michael."
00:05:54.855,00:05:57.524,Our relationship transcends race.
00:05:57.524,00:05:59.609,Nothing transcends race in here.
00:05:59.609,00:06:01.360,I can't let you do it.
00:06:01.360,00:06:03.197,"Good behavior, you're out of here in three years."
00:06:03.197,00:06:04.865,Gonna be a whole lot sooner than that.
00:06:04.865,00:06:06.533,Can't be done...
00:06:06.533,00:06:07.993,"Can't be done, Michael."
00:06:07.993,00:06:09.203,No one's ever broken out of Fox River.
00:06:09.203,00:06:11.079,Every single step's already been mapped out.
00:06:11.079,00:06:12.247,Every contingency.
00:06:12.247,00:06:14.708,Every contingency?
00:06:14.708,00:06:22.132,"You may have the blueprints of this place, but there's one thing those plans can't show you-- people, guys like Abruzzi. You so much as look at these cats the wrong way, they'll cut you up."
00:06:23.175,00:06:27.971,MICHAEL: As far as the rest of these guys are concerned I'm just another con doing his time.
00:06:27.971,00:06:30.389,Staying out of trouble.
00:06:30.389,00:06:31.516,It just finds you.
00:06:31.516,00:06:32.559,"And when it does, we'll be long gone."
00:06:32.559,00:06:33.643,This is madness.
00:06:33.643,00:06:36.437,You can't even get out of your cell.
00:06:36.437,00:06:37.731,Not true.
00:06:37.731,00:06:39.066,"What, you got a key?"
00:06:39.066,00:06:41.193,MICHAEL: Something like that.
00:08:11.491,00:08:13.076,"MAN: Wrong piece of real estate, Fish."
00:08:13.076,00:08:14.286,Belongs to T-Bag.
00:08:14.286,00:08:16.621,Who?
00:08:16.621,00:08:18.415,"You best speak with respect, Fish."
00:08:18.415,00:08:22.377,"Man kidnapped half a dozen boys and girls down in 'Bama, raped and killed 'em."
00:08:22.377,00:08:25.213,"Wasn't always in that order, either."
00:08:25.213,00:08:27.048,Does T-Bag have a real name?
00:08:27.048,00:08:28.216,That is my real name.
00:08:31.594,00:08:33.430,"No, no, no."
00:08:33.430,00:08:35.765,Please... sit.
00:08:37.600,00:08:42.230,So you're the new one I been hearin' all the rave reviews about.
00:08:42.230,00:08:44.274,Scofield.
00:08:44.274,00:08:47.402,"One thing's for sure, you're just as pretty as advertised."
00:08:47.402,00:08:48.569,"Prettier, even."
00:08:52.240,00:08:54.368,"T-BAG: Rugheads got you scared, do they?"
00:08:54.368,00:08:56.661,Sorry?
00:08:56.661,00:09:04.627,"Few days on the inside, any God-fearing white man realizes the correctional system's got a serious lean toward the African-American persuasion."
00:09:04.627,00:09:06.338,I hadn't noticed.
00:09:06.338,00:09:08.965,"They got the numbers all right, so they think they do as they please."
00:09:08.965,00:09:12.802,We got one thing they don't-- surprise.
00:09:12.802,00:09:18.850,"We gonna take the ball game to them real soon. It's gonna be nasty for a first-timer like you, but we'll protect you."
00:09:18.850,00:09:20.060,I'll protect you.
00:09:20.060,00:09:22.854,All you got to do is...
00:09:22.854,00:09:28.235,"take this pocket right here, and your life'll be all peaches and cream."
00:09:28.235,00:09:30.862,"I walk, you walk with me."
00:09:28.818,00:09:32.822,"Keep you real close, so no one up in here can hurt you."
00:09:33.990,00:09:35.909,Looks to me you already got a girlfriend.
00:09:39.120,00:09:41.706,I got a whole 'nother pocket over here.
00:09:41.706,00:09:43.250,I'll pass.
00:09:45.293,00:09:50.673,"I don't protect you, them rugheads gonna gobble you up like a plate of black-eyed peas."
00:09:50.673,00:09:51.799,I said no.
00:09:51.799,00:09:53.676,"Then you best move, then."
00:09:53.676,00:09:56.096,Now.
00:10:06.106,00:10:09.109,Know what I'm saying?
00:10:09.109,00:10:11.403,Excuse me.
00:10:11.403,00:10:13.947,Are you the Tim Giles that represented Lincoln Burrows?
00:10:13.947,00:10:15.240,"Okay, if you're a reporter..."
00:10:15.240,00:10:16.324,I'm not a reporter.
00:10:16.324,00:10:18.410,I know the defendant personally.
00:10:18.410,00:10:20.412,Huh. You family?
00:10:20.412,00:10:22.205,Not exactly.
00:10:22.205,00:10:25.083,We were in a relationship a few years back.
00:10:25.083,00:10:26.585,"Well, look, ma'am, I, uh..."
00:10:26.585,00:10:28.044,I-I don't know what to tell you.
00:10:28.044,00:10:29.421,"I mean, the man was guilty."
00:10:29.421,00:10:31.590,The prosecution's case was a slam dunk.
00:10:31.590,00:10:33.592,Because the victim was the Vice President's brother.
00:10:38.638,00:10:40.098,That's not what I meant.
00:10:41.141,00:10:43.435,The evidence was there.
00:10:43.435,00:10:45.186,Lincoln worked for Steadman's company.
00:10:48.189,00:10:50.150,"Two weeks later, Steadman's shot dead."
00:10:50.150,00:10:54.028,"The murder weapon is found in Lincoln's house, and the victim's blood found on his clothes."
00:10:54.028,00:10:58.032,"Trust me, there are cases you lose sleep over, but this isn't one of 'em."
00:10:58.908,00:11:00.827,What about Crab Simmons?
00:11:00.827,00:11:03.037,Lincoln said he could exonerate him.
00:11:03.037,00:11:04.456,Why didn't you put him on the stand?
00:11:04.456,00:11:05.999,"The man's a five-time felon, all right?"
00:11:05.999,00:11:07.250,He... He...
00:11:07.250,00:11:08.460,He had no credibility.
00:11:08.460,00:11:09.794,So you wouldn't mind if I paid him a visit?
00:11:09.794,00:11:13.381,"Be my guest, but I don't think it'd do you any good."
00:11:33.985,00:11:34.861,Strange feeling.
00:11:34.861,00:11:37.905,I don't know how to explain it.
00:11:40.200,00:11:42.202,"Now, um..."
00:11:42.202,00:11:51.211,"usually, my whole life, it's always been crazy, noisy, maddening, you know, in my head, but..."
00:11:51.211,00:11:53.588,"right now, it's quiet."
00:11:54.881,00:11:56.966,It's perfect.
00:11:56.966,00:11:59.052,Glad you came back.
00:12:01.054,00:12:04.391,I thought about you the whole time.
00:12:04.391,00:12:07.477,"You know, I, uh, made a lot of mistakes in my life."
00:12:07.477,00:12:09.896,I know that.
00:12:09.896,00:12:11.606,I'm gonna make it right.
00:12:11.606,00:12:14.401,I know you will.
00:12:20.365,00:12:22.116,Oh...
00:12:22.116,00:12:23.826,What are you doing?
00:12:23.826,00:12:25.203,I want to remember this.
00:12:25.203,00:12:26.246,No.
00:12:26.246,00:12:28.081,"Oh, come on, V, please, just one."
00:12:28.081,00:12:29.748,Okay.
00:12:39.342,00:12:40.552,"Easy, man."
00:12:40.552,00:12:41.802,How we doin' on the PUGNAc?
00:12:41.802,00:12:43.179,"Hey, I'm workin' on it."
00:12:43.179,00:12:44.389,"Well, work faster."
00:12:44.389,00:12:47.016,I need that stuff tonight.
00:12:47.016,00:12:50.270,What's up there in that infirmary that you need so bad?
00:12:50.270,00:12:53.981,"You get me that PUGNAc, and maybe I'll tell you."
00:13:03.199,00:13:06.244,Uh-uh... uh!
00:13:10.789,00:13:12.917,Thought we had an understanding.
00:13:12.917,00:13:14.586,This here's for the family.
00:13:14.586,00:13:16.879,You made it pretty clear you ain't blood.
00:13:16.879,00:13:19.758,How 'bout you hand that over?
00:13:31.018,00:13:34.481,Nice-looking piece of steel.
00:13:31.018,00:13:37.066,"Bit of work, you could do some serious damage with it."
00:13:37.858,00:13:40.903,"Question is, who was it you was plannin' on damaging?"
00:13:42.029,00:13:43.948,"I seen you with the Negroes, you know."
00:13:43.948,00:13:45.659,"Well, maybe you're one of them milk chickens."
00:13:45.659,00:13:47.034,All confused-like.
00:13:47.034,00:13:50.538,"White on the outside, black as tar on the inside."
00:13:50.538,00:13:54.334,"Maybe we ought to take a look at them insides and find out, hmm?"
00:13:54.334,00:13:55.293,Girl Scouts!
00:13:55.293,00:13:56.919,Is there a problem over there?
00:13:59.964,00:14:03.134,"Think we'll just hang onto this, if that's okay with you."
00:14:04.969,00:14:06.805,"C.O.: Hey, I'm not gonna ask you again."
00:14:06.805,00:14:08.640,"Let's break up the party, ladies."
00:14:08.640,00:14:11.850,"You heard the man, little dogie."
00:14:13.102,00:14:14.729,Get along.
00:15:51.325,00:15:55.663,"What's it take to shake down another inmate, get something he's taken from you?"
00:15:55.663,00:15:57.749,It would take Fibonacci.
00:15:57.749,00:16:03.296,I'll give you Fibonacci-- I promise you that-- when the time is right.
00:16:03.296,00:16:05.214,ABRUZZI: Time is right now.
00:16:05.214,00:16:08.509,"No, the time is right when you and I are both standing outside those walls."
00:16:08.509,00:16:10.219,You're sitting on life without parole.
00:16:10.219,00:16:12.680,You're never gonna stand outside those walls again.
00:16:12.680,00:16:13.890,Not unless you knew someone.
00:16:13.890,00:16:16.058,Someone who knew a way out.
00:16:16.058,00:16:18.102,"What do you say, John?"
00:16:18.102,00:16:21.188,I say I've heard nothing but blabber.
00:16:41.375,00:16:43.795,Philly Falzone.
00:16:43.795,00:16:46.422,It's an honor.
00:16:46.422,00:16:47.548,What are you doing here?
00:16:47.548,00:16:48.758,"Well, I, um..."
00:16:48.758,00:16:52.094,"I just thought we'd, you know, fraternize."
00:16:52.094,00:16:54.305,"He looks like it, doesn't he?"
00:16:54.305,00:16:55.807,Looks what?
00:16:55.807,00:16:57.433,Like everybody's been saying.
00:16:57.433,00:16:58.810,You got no sack.
00:16:58.810,00:16:59.936,You've been neutered.
00:17:01.437,00:17:03.523,You shouldn't talk to me like that.
00:17:03.523,00:17:05.441,You used to pick up my laundry.
00:17:05.441,00:17:06.442,"Not anymore, John."
00:17:06.442,00:17:12.114,"John, word is that someone in here knows where Fibonacci is, and you're not doing anything about it."
00:17:12.114,00:17:13.324,I'm working on it.
00:17:13.324,00:17:15.451,"Well, you're not working on it fast enough."
00:17:15.451,00:17:17.996,"Apparently, Fibonacci's coming up for air again."
00:17:17.996,00:17:21.248,"Next month, a Congressional hearing."
00:17:21.248,00:17:28.006,"Now, if he testifies at that hearing, a lot of people are going down, including me."
00:17:28.006,00:17:30.717,"Now, I've known you a long time."
00:17:30.717,00:17:34.679,"Our wives are friends, our kids go to the same Catholic school."
00:17:36.096,00:17:39.976,"Now, it would be a shame if anything were to happen to your kids."
00:17:39.976,00:17:41.769,I know my kids would miss them.
00:17:41.769,00:17:43.229,You don't need to do this.
00:17:43.229,00:17:45.648,I do.
00:17:45.648,00:17:46.649,I'll get this guy.
00:17:46.649,00:17:48.234,We'll get Fibonacci.
00:17:50.110,00:17:51.905,"Well, for everyone's sake, I hope you're right."
00:17:51.905,00:17:53.197,I am.
00:17:53.197,00:17:56.200,"Be well, John."
00:17:56.951,00:17:59.119,Thank you.
00:18:07.754,00:18:10.506,"Yo, Badge, I gotta use the phone!"
00:18:13.217,00:18:14.510,"Sure, no problem."
00:18:14.510,00:18:15.803,"You want a pizza and a pedicure, too?"
00:18:15.803,00:18:17.179,"No. It's-It's Monday, man."
00:18:17.179,00:18:18.222,I got to call my girl.
00:18:18.222,00:18:19.348,She's expecting my call.
00:18:19.348,00:18:21.059,Put a sock in it.
00:18:21.059,00:18:21.726,"No, no, no..."
00:18:30.109,00:18:32.570,"Hey, pull up the manifest."
00:18:34.989,00:18:37.366,There an Allen Schweitzer in GenPop?
00:18:39.619,00:18:40.995,Nope.
00:18:40.995,00:18:42.162,You about the SHU?
00:18:43.163,00:18:44.624,Nope.
00:18:44.624,00:18:45.291,Why are you asking?
00:18:45.291,00:18:47.835,"Curious, that's all."
00:19:26.415,00:19:28.042,"You hear the trumpets, Fish?"
00:19:28.042,00:19:30.169,I know you hear 'em.
00:19:30.169,00:19:31.712,That's Judgment Day.
00:19:31.712,00:19:34.799,It's comin'...
00:20:02.785,00:20:05.079,T-BAG: What are you doing in my cell?
00:20:08.749,00:20:10.584,I want in.
00:20:20.344,00:20:21.929,"I'm not quite sure I heard that, Fish."
00:20:21.929,00:20:23.472,Did you just say you're in?
00:20:23.472,00:20:24.724,MICHAEL: That's right.
00:20:24.724,00:20:25.599,"T-BAG: You know the old saying, don't you?"
00:20:25.599,00:20:27.351,"In for an inch, in for a mile."
00:20:27.351,00:20:28.394,Whatever it takes.
00:20:28.394,00:20:29.812,"You want me to fight, I'll fight."
00:20:29.812,00:20:32.272,The bolt from the bleachers-- that's what it was for.
00:20:32.272,00:20:36.318,"Well, you want to fight, you gonna get your chance."
00:20:36.318,00:20:38.071,Next count.
00:20:38.071,00:20:39.155,Tonight?
00:20:39.155,00:20:40.489,Problem with that?
00:20:40.489,00:20:42.075,'Cause we goin' straight at 'em.
00:20:42.075,00:20:43.826,"Better catch a square, Fish."
00:20:43.826,00:20:46.204,We undermanned in a big way.
00:20:46.204,00:20:47.454,All I need's a weapon.
00:20:47.454,00:20:48.622,"You want a weapon, bitch?"
00:20:48.622,00:20:51.876,There you go.
00:20:51.876,00:20:55.546,"All prisoners, return to your cells."
00:20:55.546,00:20:58.841,You gonna have to prove yourself 'fore we trust you with the heavy artillery.
00:20:58.841,00:20:59.592,Know what I'm sayin'?
00:20:59.592,00:21:01.177,GUARD: Gates closing!
00:21:09.685,00:21:13.522,I wanted to apologize for being so short with you before.
00:21:13.522,00:21:14.899,No problem.
00:21:13.522,00:21:20.613,"Closer it gets to an execution, the harder it becomes, so that's why I wanted to give you this."
00:21:20.613,00:21:23.783,"It's the, uh, surveillance tape of the garage that night."
00:21:23.783,00:21:28.287,"It was a closed trial, so no one outside of the courtroom saw it, but I thought it could help you out."
00:21:28.287,00:21:29.163,With what?
00:21:29.163,00:21:31.624,Closure.
00:22:18.671,00:22:21.465,Allen Schweitzer.
00:22:21.465,00:22:23.634,That name mean anything to you?
00:22:25.469,00:22:26.762,Should it?
00:22:26.762,00:22:29.890,I don't know.
00:22:30.641,00:22:32.226,Never heard of the guy.
00:22:32.226,00:22:33.602,Are you sure?
00:22:33.602,00:22:36.063,Positive.
00:22:59.670,00:23:01.797,"Uh, what's up, Snowflake?"
00:23:08.762,00:23:10.597,Do you think I'm a fool?
00:23:11.891,00:23:13.893,What are you talking about?
00:23:13.893,00:23:16.229,I see you up there with the Hitler Youth.
00:23:18.814,00:23:21.067,"You know, I got a good mind to slash you open right now."
00:23:21.067,00:23:22.902,It's not what you think.
00:23:22.902,00:23:24.904,They've got something I need.
00:23:26.239,00:23:28.032,"Now, see, that's funny."
00:23:28.032,00:23:30.408,"Because I got something you need, too."
00:23:32.078,00:23:35.164,"You want your PUGNAc, Fish, huh?"
00:23:38.042,00:23:39.459,"Right here, baby."
00:23:39.459,00:23:40.418,It's all you.
00:23:44.006,00:23:46.424,"C-NOTE: Listen, white boy, your luck just ran out."
00:23:47.718,00:23:50.470,You chose the wrong side.
00:24:31.178,00:24:35.099,Man... it's great to see your face.
00:24:42.815,00:24:43.899,What?
00:24:43.899,00:24:46.193,It's starting to ruin people's lives.
00:24:48.112,00:24:50.406,Michael's in here because he thinks you're innocent.
00:24:50.406,00:24:52.116,He told you.
00:24:52.116,00:24:54.743,"He hasn't told me anything, but I know, Lincoln."
00:24:54.743,00:24:57.163,I know what he's planning.
00:24:57.163,00:24:58.705,Call him off.
00:24:58.705,00:25:01.083,"If you love him, call him off."
00:25:02.876,00:25:04.837,I saw the tape.
00:25:04.837,00:25:06.504,What's on the tape's not how it went down.
00:25:06.504,00:25:07.340,I know what I saw.
00:25:07.340,00:25:09.758,I know what I saw.
00:25:09.758,00:25:12.011,"I was there, remember?"
00:25:15.639,00:25:18.434,I got high that night.
00:25:18.434,00:25:20.311,It was the only way I could go through with it.
00:25:34.200,00:25:36.327,I never pulled the trigger.
00:25:36.327,00:25:38.996,The guy was already dead.
00:25:40.247,00:25:41.665,"Yeah, I know. You've told me a thousand..."
00:25:41.665,00:25:43.125,Then listen! I was set up!
00:25:43.125,00:25:45.669,I went there that night to clear a debt.
00:25:45.669,00:25:47.754,Crab Simmons was on my ass for the 90 grand I owed him.
00:25:47.754,00:25:51.300,"He told me the mark was some scumbag drug dealer and, if I took it, we'd be clean."
00:25:51.300,00:25:52.801,I never pulled the trigger.
00:25:52.801,00:25:55.888,All I know is that somebody wanted me in the same garage as Terrence Steadman that night.
00:25:55.888,00:25:59.225,Why would somebody want to set you up?
00:26:00.558,00:26:03.729,It wasn't about me.
00:26:03.729,00:26:04.604,Steadman?
00:26:04.604,00:26:05.856,Yes!
00:26:05.856,00:26:06.606,The guy was like a saint.
00:26:06.606,00:26:10.486,"All the charity work, the environmental progress his company was making..."
00:26:10.486,00:26:14.740,About the only person in this entire country who had motive to kill him was you.
00:26:14.740,00:26:18.618,You came all the way down here to tell me how guilty I am?
00:26:19.577,00:26:22.039,I don't know why I came here.
00:26:27.461,00:26:36.762,"You have your life now-- I know that-- but if what we had before meant anything to you, you'll find out the truth."
00:26:38.722,00:26:41.350,Maybe all this is the truth.
00:26:41.350,00:26:44.228,Maybe they got it right.
00:26:55.448,00:26:56.490,INMATE: Ooh!
00:26:58.825,00:27:01.412,"What you all doing, boy?"
00:27:04.540,00:27:06.875,Real funny.
00:27:06.875,00:27:10.087,white boy!
00:27:19.012,00:27:22.516,"Badge! Badge! Open up, Badge!"
00:27:22.516,00:27:23.850,You talking again?
00:27:23.850,00:27:24.684,It's my girl's birthday.
00:27:24.684,00:27:25.727,"Happy birthday to her, then."
00:27:25.727,00:27:26.728,You gotta let me call her! Please!
00:27:26.728,00:27:29.856,I'll give you a million dollars if you let me use the phone.
00:27:29.856,00:27:31.024,"I seen your kicks, Sucre."
00:27:31.024,00:27:32.401,You got something like 40 cents to your name.
00:27:32.401,00:27:34.278,Please!
00:27:34.278,00:27:36.654,"God, no!"
00:27:57.050,00:27:58.802,HECTOR: All right.
00:27:58.802,00:28:00.346,Maricruz.
00:28:00.346,00:28:01.305,What are you doing?
00:28:01.305,00:28:02.889,Come on.
00:28:02.889,00:28:04.558,"It's okay, Hector."
00:28:04.558,00:28:05.643,What are you talking about?
00:28:05.643,00:28:07.811,I think I'm just going to take a cab.
00:28:07.811,00:28:08.686,What do you mean?
00:28:08.686,00:28:12.191,"I mean, you just got here."
00:28:14.318,00:28:17.029,"He didn't call you, did he?"
00:28:19.156,00:28:24.828,"Look... I love Fernando to death, but the guy's a deadbeat."
00:28:24.828,00:28:27.665,You got to move on with your life.
00:28:34.254,00:28:38.758,"KELLERMAN: Mr. Giles, we'd like to have a word with you, if we could."
00:28:38.758,00:28:40.219,I'm afraid we're going to have to insist.
00:28:42.137,00:28:46.141,It's come to our attention that you made a FOIL request a couple of days ago on the Burrows case.
00:28:48.977,00:28:50.270,Yeah. So?
00:28:48.977,00:28:52.147,Records show that you made a dupe of the surveillance tape.
00:28:52.147,00:28:53.607,That's right.
00:28:53.607,00:28:56.109,Mind us asking why?
00:28:57.110,00:28:59.697,"It's for one of Burrows' old girlfriends, man."
00:28:59.697,00:29:02.408,She was under the impression that the guy was innocent.
00:29:02.408,00:29:03.617,"I figured it'd, you know, help her with closure."
00:29:03.617,00:29:05.952,"She's in possession of the tape now, then?"
00:29:05.952,00:29:07.829,Don't pull that card on me.
00:29:07.829,00:29:09.415,It's the Freedom of Information Act.
00:29:09.415,00:29:12.334,She's entitled to that tape as much as you or I are.
00:29:12.334,00:29:14.420,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, by all means, by all means."
00:29:14.420,00:29:15.462,May I go now?
00:29:15.462,00:29:16.880,Just one more thing.
00:29:16.880,00:29:19.258,This old girlfriend of his...
00:29:19.258,00:29:22.052,what's her name?
00:29:32.563,00:29:34.940,Excuse me.
00:29:34.940,00:29:36.483,Is this the Simmons residence?
00:29:36.483,00:29:37.484,I'm Ms. Simmons.
00:29:37.484,00:29:40.112,I'm sorry. Um...
00:29:40.112,00:29:42.197,I'm Veronica Donovan.
00:29:42.197,00:29:44.032,I'm looking for Crab Simmons.
00:29:44.032,00:29:45.951,He's my son.
00:29:45.951,00:29:46.785,Is he around?
00:29:46.785,00:29:48.870,No.
00:29:48.870,00:29:50.789,Could you tell me where I could find him?
00:29:50.789,00:29:51.873,I can't help you.
00:29:51.873,00:29:54.000,Can't you understand that?
00:29:54.000,00:29:59.881,"It's just... a man's life is at stake, and maybe your son can help him."
00:29:59.881,00:30:03.469,"Crab can't help nobody, lady."
00:30:06.555,00:30:09.141,I'm sorry.
00:30:21.236,00:30:22.070,Heads up!
00:30:22.070,00:30:24.156,"7-Up, cons. Stand your gate!"
00:30:28.410,00:30:31.747,"'Bout to jump off, Fish."
00:30:46.845,00:30:48.888,"Ballard, get back on your number."
00:30:51.183,00:30:52.267,I need backup.
00:30:56.647,00:30:58.273,"Inmates, return to your cells immediately."
00:30:59.858,00:31:04.112,"Riot squad, report to cell block D."
00:31:56.623,00:31:59.418,Help me...
00:32:02.421,00:32:04.297,Scofield!
00:32:41.167,00:32:44.755,"You're a dead man, Scofield!"
00:32:44.755,00:32:47.006,You hear me?!
00:32:47.006,00:32:49.050,You're a dead man!
00:33:36.598,00:33:40.477,I really don't know what to say to you gentlemen.
00:33:40.477,00:33:45.231,"I try to give you the benefit of the doubt, I try to treat you with respect."
00:33:47.066,00:33:49.068,You can't even respect yourselves.
00:33:49.068,00:33:52.698,"So, there's going to be a 48-hour lockdown."
00:33:52.698,00:33:55.408,No mess. No showers.
00:33:55.408,00:34:01.331,And I strongly suggest that you all learn to get along.
00:34:01.331,00:34:05.043,"Otherwise, the next time, it's going to be a week, and the time after that, it's going to be a month."
00:34:05.043,00:34:07.587,Think about it.
00:34:41.914,00:34:44.416,I don't know who that is.
00:34:44.416,00:34:47.168,She says she used to date Crab Simmons.
00:34:49.838,00:34:50.881,"Leticia, thank you for calling."
00:34:50.881,00:34:55.761,"You want to hear what I have to say, we meet in a public place where they can't get to us."
00:34:55.761,00:34:58.179,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:34:58.179,00:35:00.306,You want to hear what I have to say or not?
00:35:00.306,00:35:02.225,"'Cause, if you don't, I'm going to hang up right now."
00:35:02.225,00:35:06.104,"No, no, no. You just name the time and the place."
00:35:09.441,00:35:10.275,LETICIA: Over here.
00:35:10.275,00:35:12.151,"Leticia, thanks for coming.."
00:35:12.151,00:35:13.319,"Go easy, lady."
00:35:13.319,00:35:15.196,"We don't know each other, you got that?"
00:35:15.196,00:35:17.741,We'll stay out here in the open where they can't get to us.
00:35:17.741,00:35:19.952,Where they can't do what they do.
00:35:19.952,00:35:24.873,Only reason why I'm talking to you 'cause they gonna kill your boy like they killed mine.
00:35:24.873,00:35:27.000,"Coroner's report says smack killed your boyfriend, Leticia."
00:35:27.000,00:35:28.043,It was an overdose.
00:35:28.043,00:35:29.086,Wasn't no overdose.
00:35:29.086,00:35:30.128,What do you mean?
00:35:30.128,00:35:31.212,Crab didn't use.
00:35:31.212,00:35:32.297,He had a bad heart.
00:35:32.297,00:35:33.966,"If he touched the stuff, it'd kill him."
00:35:33.966,00:35:39.220,"I mean, don't you think it's just the slightest bit of a coincidence he OD'd a week after your boyfriend's crime?"
00:35:39.220,00:35:41.556,They killed him 'cause he knew things.
00:35:41.556,00:35:43.475,Things they didn't want to get out.
00:35:43.475,00:35:44.601,Like what?
00:35:44.601,00:35:46.478,Like who was really behind that hit that night.
00:35:46.478,00:35:47.437,"Wasn't Crab, that's for damn sure."
00:35:47.437,00:35:49.940,And it sure as hell wasn't Lincoln.
00:35:49.940,00:35:51.900,Neither of them boys knew what they were getting into.
00:35:51.900,00:35:53.610,They were just pawns in a big game.
00:35:53.610,00:35:54.653,What?
00:35:54.653,00:35:55.737,"Who's here, Leticia?"
00:35:55.737,00:35:56.613,Don't try to follow me.
00:35:56.613,00:35:58.115,Don't find me.
00:35:58.115,00:36:00.659,Just slow down and talk to me.
00:36:00.659,00:36:02.744,"I'd get as far away from here as you can, girl."
00:36:02.744,00:36:04.913,'Cause there ain't nobody they can't get to.
00:36:06.331,00:36:08.125,Leticia!
00:36:42.826,00:36:44.577,Hello.
00:36:44.577,00:36:46.705,We have a small complication.
00:36:46.705,00:36:48.456,There's a lawyer poking around.
00:36:48.456,00:36:50.375,WOMAN: Veronica Donovan.
00:36:50.375,00:36:52.752,Yes.
00:36:52.752,00:36:58.758,You can handle a girl who graduated in the middle of her Baylor law school class.
00:36:58.758,00:37:03.138,"At least I'd like to think so, given the stakes of what we're dealing with here."
00:37:09.895,00:37:14.273,Anyone that's a threat to what we're doing is expendable.
00:37:14.273,00:37:15.441,Anyone.
00:37:15.441,00:37:16.818,Understood.
00:37:16.818,00:37:19.320,Then do what you need to do to make this go away.
00:37:32.834,00:37:34.878,"You there, Pretty?"
00:37:39.591,00:37:41.843,I know you're there.
00:37:41.843,00:37:45.722,Just want you to know I'm coming for you.
00:37:45.722,00:37:48.767,You got nowhere to run.
00:37:48.767,00:37:52.520,You're trapped in that little hole of yours.
00:37:52.520,00:37:56.024,Trapped like a pig I'm going to slaughter.
00:39:26.364,00:39:27.991,Who's my 1:00?
00:39:27.991,00:39:30.368,NURSE: Uh... Michael Scofield.
00:39:32.453,00:39:34.706,"I was wrong about you, Scofield."
00:39:35.915,00:39:37.416,Little bit late.
00:39:37.416,00:39:39.085,"Better late than never, right?"
00:39:39.085,00:39:40.712,Scofield! Infirmary!
00:39:40.712,00:39:42.130,We'll see about that.
00:39:42.130,00:39:44.132,Mm-hmm.
00:39:45.175,00:39:47.677,"I'm gonna find out, you know..."
00:39:47.677,00:39:50.513,what it is you're doing up there.
00:39:59.981,00:40:01.858,MICHAEL: How long does this take?
00:40:01.858,00:40:03.151,It used to take hours.
00:40:03.151,00:40:05.028,They've come a long way with the new glucose kits.
00:40:05.028,00:40:06.821,This'll take us about ten seconds.
00:40:06.821,00:40:11.034,"Slide the strip into the meter, we're ready to go."
00:40:12.744,00:40:21.294,"I'm sure you know this, but average glucose for the non-diabetic is about 100 milligrams per deciliter, so we see a number like that here, and we know you've been misdiagnosed."
00:40:29.468,00:40:31.721,You seem nervous.
00:40:31.721,00:40:33.098,I do?
00:40:33.098,00:40:34.473,You're sweating.
00:40:34.473,00:40:37.685,Must be the needles.
00:40:37.685,00:40:38.770,Never really got used to them.
00:40:38.770,00:40:42.274,"Somehow, with diabetes and that tattoo, I find that hard to believe."
00:40:43.233,00:40:44.692,Ah...
00:40:46.986,00:40:48.654,"Bad news, I'm afraid."
00:40:51.950,00:40:53.701,180 milligrams per deciliter.
00:40:53.701,00:40:55.828,You're definitely diabetic.
00:41:02.001,00:41:04.587,Do you need anything else from me?
00:41:04.587,00:41:06.339,Arm to stick a needle in.
00:41:08.549,00:41:10.218,I'll see you Wednesday.
00:41:10.218,00:41:12.553,NURSE: Cute.
00:41:12.553,00:41:14.931,Prisoner.
00:41:14.931,00:41:16.766,I don't know.
00:41:16.766,00:41:17.976,There's something strange about him.
00:41:17.976,00:41:22.563,"I gave him the results of his blood test, and there was this look on his face."
00:41:22.563,00:41:25.233,"It was, um..."
00:41:25.233,00:41:28.194,relief.
00:41:30.738,00:41:31.656,It's all right.
00:41:31.656,00:41:34.117,I'm headed over to A-Wing anyhow.
00:41:36.577,00:41:38.997,"You're positively beaming, boss."
00:41:38.997,00:41:41.874,"Got up on the right side of the bed this morning, I guess."
00:41:42.667,00:41:43.918,Hold up.
00:41:43.918,00:41:45.420,Sugar.
00:41:45.420,00:41:47.464,"Don't you move, Fishy."
00:41:48.423,00:41:49.799,"MICHAEL: Hey, what are you doing?"
00:41:49.799,00:41:52.260,"You're coming with us, Fish."
00:42:05.690,00:42:12.155,This little polka you and I have been doing for a while-- as of this moment...

00:42:47.399,00:42:49.192,"Now, I'm going to count to three."
00:42:50.276,00:42:52.111,One...
00:42:52.111,00:42:55.114,"I give you that information, I'm a dead man."
00:42:55.114,00:42:57.575,You know it and I know it.
00:42:57.575,00:42:59.577,Two...
00:42:59.577,00:43:03.498,"I'll tell you the moment we're outside those walls, not a second before."
00:43:03.498,00:43:05.542,You tell me now.
00:43:07.168,00:43:09.254,"Not gonna happen, John."
00:43:09.254,00:43:10.046,Hey...
00:43:10.046,00:43:14.092,I'm going to give you one last chance.

00:00:11.010,00:00:13.764,I find it incumbent that you see the inside of a prison cell.

00:00:21.229,00:00:23.064,I'm getting you out of here.
00:00:23.106,00:00:25.024,"Not if you designed the place, it isn't."
00:00:26.067,00:00:27.068,You've seen the blueprints.
00:00:27.110,00:00:27.695,Better than that.
00:00:27.736,00:00:29.029,I've got them on me.
00:00:30.155,00:00:31.323,You find out who's trying to bury him.
00:00:31.365,00:00:33.074,Nobody's trying to bury him.
00:00:33.116,00:00:34.075,The evidence was cooked.
00:00:34.117,00:00:35.703,There's a lawyer poking around.
00:00:35.744,00:00:37.078,Anyone that's a threat is expendable.

00:00:42.751,00:00:44.127,Someone found Fibonacci.
00:00:44.169,00:00:47.130,Who was this someone and where is Fibonacci?
00:00:47.172,00:00:50.049,"I give you that information, I'm a dead man."

00:01:14.282,00:01:16.076,Let me get him.
00:01:23.208,00:01:24.334,Get out.
00:01:27.546,00:01:30.089,I thought you said you were going to have a conversation with him.
00:01:30.841,00:01:32.051,"Yeah, I did."
00:01:33.510,00:01:35.262,"Things, uh, escalated."
00:01:39.224,00:01:40.684,We need some help here.
00:01:42.185,00:01:43.604,Bring him on into 3.
00:01:43.645,00:01:44.103,"Kathy, I'm gonna need 10 cc's of Xylocaine."
00:01:52.195,00:01:53.948,"Thanks, guys."
00:01:55.323,00:01:57.242,"I said, thank you."
00:01:58.243,00:01:59.411,Let's go.
00:02:03.206,00:02:05.125,"Okay, let's take a look at you."
00:02:07.502,00:02:09.504,"You're okay, you're okay."
00:02:16.219,00:02:17.137,What happened?
00:02:18.221,00:02:19.264,Nothing.
00:02:19.306,00:02:21.141,"This isn't nothing, Michael."
00:02:21.182,00:02:22.183,I need you to tell me what happened.
00:02:22.225,00:02:24.937,Don't make me lie to you.
00:02:26.313,00:02:27.856,Please.
00:02:29.232,00:02:30.567,"All right, you guys are good."
00:02:30.609,00:02:31.401,"Yeah, no problem."
00:02:31.443,00:02:33.236,All right.
00:02:35.238,00:02:36.239,I think you better have IA start an investigation.
00:02:36.281,00:02:38.158,"Oh, there's no need."
00:02:39.493,00:02:42.203,"Uh, perhaps you'd be good enough to enlighten me."
00:02:42.245,00:02:44.205,There was a pair of gardening shears left on the floor of the shed.
00:02:44.247,00:02:46.750,Evidently he stepped on them.
00:02:47.876,00:02:49.210,"Blade went right through his boot, huh?"
00:02:49.252,00:02:50.629,Yeah.
00:02:50.671,00:02:52.965,"So, uh, why wasn't the boot still on his foot?"
00:02:58.971,00:03:00.179,Let's go.
00:03:34.297,00:03:36.257,I'm gonna kill that scum.
00:03:36.299,00:03:38.259,"You kill him, you kill our express ticket out of here."
00:03:38.301,00:03:39.761,Look what he did to you.
00:03:39.803,00:03:42.222,You're not gonna last a second in this place unless I do something about it.
00:03:43.682,00:03:46.560,You ever hear of Top Flight Charters?
00:03:46.601,00:03:51.690,"They operate flights from small airfields across the Midwest, like the one 10 miles from here."
00:03:51.732,00:03:54.275,MICHAEL: They're run by a shell corporation Abruzzi owns.
00:03:54.317,00:03:57.112,We get him on board.
00:03:54.317,00:03:59.280,There's going to be a midnight flight waiting for us the night we get outside those walls.
00:03:59.322,00:04:02.492,You're willing to risk the entire escape on a guy you don't even know?
00:04:02.534,00:04:04.244,Preparation can only take you so far.
00:04:05.620,00:04:07.330,"After that, you gotta take a few leaps of faith."
00:04:09.917,00:04:11.626,"Abruzzi's a huge leap of faith, Michael."
00:04:11.668,00:04:13.378,MICHAEL: I'm not talking about Abruzzi.
00:04:13.420,00:04:16.173,There's someone else who holds the key to this entire thing.
00:04:19.634,00:04:22.137,"MICHAEL: Problem is, couldn't know who that was until we got in here."
00:04:24.347,00:04:26.307,LINCOLN: Sucre?
00:04:27.851,00:04:28.560,"The guy is a thief, Michael."
00:04:28.602,00:04:30.562,He can't be trusted.
00:04:30.604,00:04:34.274,Gonna have to trust him because he's my cellmate.
00:04:35.483,00:04:36.860,How well do you know him?
00:04:36.902,00:04:38.946,About as well as a man can in a week.
00:04:40.363,00:04:43.324,"You tell him, he tells everyone, we're done."
00:04:43.366,00:04:44.325,"You know that, right?"
00:04:44.367,00:04:47.370,"If we don't get him on board, there's not gonna be any digging in that cell."
00:04:47.412,00:04:50.290,"If there's no digging in that cell, then there's no escape."
00:05:30.205,00:05:32.040,I like it.
00:05:32.082,00:05:33.834,ANSWERING MACHINE: Thank you for calling.
00:05:33.875,00:05:35.376,Please leave a message after the tone.
00:05:36.461,00:05:38.337,"Maricruz. It's me, baby."
00:05:40.215,00:05:41.549,"Pick up if you're there, mami."
00:05:41.591,00:05:43.342,I've been in the SHU.
00:05:44.303,00:05:45.428,I've been thinking about you.
00:05:46.429,00:05:47.931,SUCRE: About your body.
00:05:49.099,00:05:50.433,"God, I've been thinking about your body."
00:05:50.475,00:05:52.060,MRS. DELGADO: Hello?
00:05:52.811,00:05:54.229,"Uh, Mrs. Delgado."
00:05:58.441,00:06:03.155,"Um, sorry to bother you at home, but, um, you know what's up with Maricruz's cell phone?"
00:06:03.197,00:06:04.405,It just keeps going straight to voice mail.
00:06:04.447,00:06:05.364,Maybe she has it turned off.
00:06:08.202,00:06:09.410,Any chance you know where she is?
00:06:09.452,00:06:11.370,I know exactly where she is.
00:06:12.455,00:06:13.414,And that would be?
00:06:14.666,00:06:15.834,Hector?
00:06:15.876,00:06:17.294,That's right.
00:06:17.336,00:06:18.461,"They're at the mall, I think."
00:06:18.503,00:06:21.380,I don't suppose next time you see her you could have her turn her phone back on?
00:06:22.465,00:06:27.428,"Mrs. Delgado, I know you don't like me, but I love your daughter and she loves me."
00:06:27.470,00:06:29.430,"We're gonna get married, you know."
00:06:29.472,00:06:35.478,"If you were a decent man and you really loved her, you'd let her live her life."
00:06:36.479,00:06:38.397,What's that supposed to mean?
00:06:39.274,00:06:39.398,I'll tell her you called.
00:07:49.219,00:07:51.263,I'm looking to do some damage.
00:07:51.305,00:07:53.432,"Well, you've come to the right place."
00:07:53.473,00:07:55.309,I wanna do it slow.
00:07:56.393,00:08:02.399,"Inflict the maximum amount of pain so the guy wishes he'd just die, you know, and get it over with but just can't quite get there."
00:08:02.774,00:08:03.483,"Oh, I got that."
00:08:06.445,00:08:07.195,I got that.
00:08:10.657,00:08:12.575,"Look at this right here, boss."
00:08:16.579,00:08:18.332,I call it the gutter.
00:08:18.373,00:08:23.128,You jam it up there in the stomach and these bits right here hook the intestines.
00:08:23.170,00:08:28.425,"You give it a pull back, poor sucker's guts are hanging right out of his stomach."
00:08:28.467,00:08:31.636,And he'll get a real good look at them 'cause the wound's not fatal.
00:08:31.678,00:08:35.390,"Well, at least not until the infection sets in."
00:08:41.146,00:08:43.523,"You're one sick puppy, you know that?"
00:08:45.192,00:08:45.525,Thank you.
00:09:05.879,00:09:07.214,What happened?
00:09:14.804,00:09:16.348,"They've gotten to you, haven't they?"
00:09:16.390,00:09:18.725,The other prisoners.
00:09:20.018,00:09:21.811,"My God, Michael, this place is gonna kill you."
00:09:21.853,00:09:23.230,You said you talked to a woman.
00:09:23.271,00:09:24.605,What was her name?
00:09:25.606,00:09:27.359,Leticia.
00:09:27.984,00:09:29.569,How'd you know?
00:09:29.610,00:09:31.612,"A year ago, I was doing exactly what you're doing."
00:09:31.654,00:09:33.448,Trying to find out the truth.
00:09:34.449,00:09:35.616,"It's a bottomless pit, Veronica."
00:09:35.658,00:09:40.788,"They designed it that way so that by the time you got to the bottom of it, Lincoln would be dead."
00:09:40.830,00:09:42.623,Why didn't you tell me you were doing this?
00:09:42.665,00:09:48.629,"Once the day was set, once that final appeal had been rejected, he had 60 days to live."
00:09:49.756,00:09:55.387,"I figured I could play their game and watch him die in the process, or I could take matters into my own hands."
00:09:55.429,00:09:57.138,You don't have to do that.
00:09:58.432,00:09:59.766,Leticia knows something I can get out of her.
00:09:59.807,00:10:01.351,Or maybe we can reopen Lincoln's case.
00:10:01.393,00:10:03.644,What'd she tell you?
00:10:03.686,00:10:07.648,She said that somebody else was behind the killing of the Vice President's brother.
00:10:07.690,00:10:09.317,Who?
00:10:09.359,00:10:10.444,She took off before I could get anything out of her.
00:10:13.154,00:10:15.323,She's holed up in the Elysian Fields Projects.
00:10:15.365,00:10:16.950,I'm going to go see her this afternoon.
00:10:16.991,00:10:18.118,The place is dangerous.
00:10:18.159,00:10:19.744,You should take someone with you.
00:10:19.786,00:10:20.995,Who?
00:10:22.122,00:10:23.582,Fiance would be a good place to start.
00:10:23.623,00:10:26.918,I think that's probably the last thing in the world Sebastian would ever want to do.
00:10:27.919,00:10:28.587,It's good to see you.
00:10:28.628,00:10:30.464,"You, too."
00:10:39.013,00:10:44.018,"No priors, a good student, then you get yourself arrested for intent to sell."
00:10:44.936,00:10:45.645,Good life get a little boring?
00:10:47.147,00:10:47.688,It was stupid.
00:10:49.149,00:10:50.609,It won't happen again.
00:10:50.650,00:10:52.110,"Well, we're all here to make sure of that."
00:10:53.736,00:10:55.947,I took some time to speak to your mother before you came in.
00:10:55.989,00:10:59.784,"She told me that there were some, some extenuating circumstances in your life right..."
00:10:59.826,00:11:02.954,"Hey, if you're talking about that guy at Fox River, he's got nothing to do with this."
00:11:02.996,00:11:05.123,He refuses to call him his father.
00:11:06.666,00:11:08.168,The world will be a better place without him.
00:11:08.209,00:11:10.711,"It's clear to me you've got a lot of anger, young man."
00:11:10.753,00:11:13.256,"Misdirected, it could land you in the wrong place."
00:11:14.549,00:11:17.885,"JENAE: So to make sure that doesn't happen, you're going to have to check in with me once a week."
00:11:17.927,00:11:19.678,Fridays. One hour.
00:11:21.222,00:11:22.557,Your attendance at school and your grades need to be pristine.
00:11:22.599,00:11:23.682,Absolutely.
00:11:23.724,00:11:30.524,"And to give you a real good idea where that anger of yours will get you, if you don't rein it in, I'm signing you up for the Scared Straight program at Fox River."
00:11:30.565,00:11:34.486,"You'll have a mentor who you'll work with weekly, to give you a little perspective."
00:11:34.528,00:11:35.694,A mentor?
00:11:36.988,00:11:38.114,Your father.
00:12:01.429,00:12:03.473,Tell me that ain't what I think it is.
00:12:03.515,00:12:05.684,It ain't what you think it is.
00:12:05.724,00:12:08.727,"Fish, a cell phone in here?"
00:12:09.563,00:12:10.855,That's cardinal sin Number 1.
00:12:10.897,00:12:13.107,They can tack two years onto your bid.
00:12:13.149,00:12:14.775,If they catch you.
00:12:14.817,00:12:18.737,"Hey, you know what kind of trouble I can get, for just knowing what I know?"
00:12:20.823,00:12:24.118,"Now that means you can make calls whenever you want, right?"
00:12:29.123,00:12:30.958,I don't like the look in your eye.
00:12:31.000,00:12:33.878,"What's in there, you never saw it. Got it?"
00:12:40.427,00:12:43.012,Why didn't you include any names?
00:12:44.138,00:12:45.557,Why would I want anyone to watch me die?
00:12:45.599,00:12:48.809,I've seen it happen a number of ways.
00:12:49.852,00:12:51.396,Some people want to go it alone.
00:12:51.438,00:12:55.149,Others have grandiose statements they want to make.
00:12:56.568,00:13:03.032,But most want some member of their family there before they leave this world.
00:13:05.868,00:13:07.120,I'll do it alone.
00:13:07.870,00:13:17.130,"Son, in my opinion, all inmates who have made that choice have deeply regretted it in their final minutes."
00:13:23.844,00:13:25.888,leave it blank for now.
00:13:26.889,00:13:28.849,You have less than four weeks now.
00:13:28.891,00:13:29.808,You should give it some thought.
00:13:54.375,00:13:55.794,Five.
00:13:56.169,00:13:57.003,Thank you.
00:14:16.564,00:14:17.856,Hello?
00:14:25.948,00:14:27.867,Don't you move a muscle.
00:14:35.834,00:14:36.917,"Take it easy, Leticia."
00:14:36.959,00:14:39.086,"You're working with them, aren't you?"
00:14:39.962,00:14:40.921,"You think I'm stupid, lady?"
00:14:43.966,00:14:46.469,I know you're scared.
00:14:47.512,00:14:48.929,"But, please, uh, put the gun down."
00:14:53.768,00:14:54.935,Where you going?
00:14:56.062,00:14:58.898,Ireland.
00:14:58.939,00:15:00.692,It makes all the difference.
00:15:00.734,00:15:02.902,That's exactly the reason I'm still breathing.
00:15:04.362,00:15:06.656,"I'm not with them, Leticia."
00:15:06.698,00:15:07.948,"Oh, yeah?"
00:15:07.990,00:15:11.035,I thought maybe they'd gotten to you.
00:15:11.077,00:15:14.288,And why do you care so much about my well-being all of a sudden?
00:15:14.330,00:15:15.206,I don't.
00:15:15.248,00:15:16.916,"Finally, an honest answer."
00:15:16.957,00:15:23.715,"But maybe you can save Lincoln, and maybe you can bring down the guys who killed your boyfriend in the process."
00:15:23.757,00:15:29.095,"If somebody killed you and Crab could've done something to the guys who did it, you think he would've?"
00:15:30.012,00:15:32.056,I'm not as strong as he was.
00:15:32.098,00:15:33.767,I can't take those people on.
00:15:34.308,00:15:35.059,I'll take them on.
00:15:37.019,00:15:40.022,All you have to do is come to my office and tell me what you know.
00:15:40.064,00:15:41.816,I'll type it up.
00:15:42.942,00:15:44.944,I'll take you to the airport myself.
00:15:48.155,00:15:49.949,"CO: All right, ladies."
00:16:30.114,00:16:31.157,Bellick.
00:16:32.074,00:16:32.992,"Hey, what's up, Lincoln?"
00:16:34.577,00:16:37.037,I want some extra time outside for the next couple of weeks.
00:16:37.079,00:16:38.873,Paint fumes in PI must be getting to you.
00:16:40.082,00:16:42.126,Cell phones allowed in here?
00:16:45.087,00:16:46.339,Who?
00:16:46.380,00:16:49.843,"Extra time outside, a couple of cigarettes."
00:16:49.884,00:16:53.012,"Half hour, one week."
00:16:59.894,00:17:02.146,Know a con named Sucre?
00:17:13.240,00:17:15.034,"This is what I don't understand, John."
00:17:16.118,00:17:18.538,Otto Fibonacci fingers you.
00:17:18.579,00:17:20.331,He put you in prison for life.
00:17:22.124,00:17:24.084,Yet you act like you don't even want to find out where he is.
00:17:24.126,00:17:25.879,"That's not true, Philly."
00:17:25.920,00:17:31.217,"Well, maybe it's 'cause you don't think you have anything to lose anymore, you know, y-y-you're already locked up."
00:17:31.258,00:17:33.093,"You know, maybe you, um, maybe you like it here."
00:17:33.135,00:17:35.013,"I mean, I don't know."
00:17:35.054,00:17:44.104,"But what I do know, is that if Fibonacci testifies next month, you and I are going to be neighbors, and I am not going to let that happen."
00:17:44.146,00:17:47.107,"I don't think you would fit in here, Philly."
00:17:48.985,00:17:53.322,"Fancy suits, ties, and shirts..."
00:17:55.366,00:17:56.075,I think you're right.
00:17:57.284,00:17:59.078,"So, uh, so let's cut to the chase."
00:17:59.871,00:18:00.955,Did you break this kid?
00:18:02.040,00:18:03.499,Did he tell you where Fibonacci is?
00:18:12.759,00:18:13.885,What is this?
00:18:13.927,00:18:15.511,It's a little gift from me to you.
00:18:20.182,00:18:21.141,Are these his?
00:18:21.183,00:18:22.060,"Yeah, he won't crack."
00:18:27.189,00:18:30.735,"Well, perhaps you should consider using a different methodology then, John."
00:18:37.408,00:18:40.160,"What happened to the days when you used to trust me, Philly?"
00:18:40.202,00:18:41.913,That I would get things done?
00:18:43.623,00:18:45.083,"Those were the days when you actually did get things done, John."
00:18:53.299,00:18:54.300,KIDS: Daddy!
00:18:54.341,00:18:56.677,"Daddy, did you hear the news?"
00:18:57.303,00:19:00.098,What? What... What news?
00:19:00.139,00:19:03.183,We're going to stay with Uncle Philly at the lake for a few weeks.
00:19:03.225,00:19:05.185,Yeah. We're gonna have a good time.
00:19:07.105,00:19:08.898,"You're right, John."
00:19:08.940,00:19:11.191,I do trust you.
00:19:11.233,00:19:14.612,"Now, you're going to take care of that thing, aren't you?"
00:19:22.870,00:19:26.165,How are those boneyard visits going with that girlfriend of yours?
00:19:28.250,00:19:30.419,"I imagine pretty good, huh?"
00:19:35.883,00:19:40.013,"You know, visitation rules stipulate that conjugals are only for married couples."
00:19:40.054,00:19:42.264,But we're engaged.
00:19:42.306,00:19:46.185,"Besides, I got that coming to me 'cause I ain't caused no static in this place."
00:19:47.269,00:19:50.898,"Please, don't dead my conjugals."
00:19:51.398,00:19:52.859,I won't.
00:19:53.275,00:19:55.194,Thank you.
00:19:55.862,00:20:00.282,But in exchange you have to tell me where that cell phone is.
00:20:03.285,00:20:05.245,"Now, don't play stupid with me."
00:20:05.287,00:20:07.247,I'm giving you a chance to save your precious conjugals.
00:20:07.289,00:20:11.210,"You lie to me, they're gone, and they're never coming back."
00:20:14.505,00:20:16.215,"Now, where's that cell phone?"
00:20:23.305,00:20:25.307,"C.O.: Watch the talking, gentlemen."
00:20:44.827,00:20:48.288,"Turner, your transfer came in."
00:20:48.330,00:20:49.082,They want you in administration.
00:21:04.430,00:21:05.431,He didn't talk.
00:21:14.398,00:21:18.027,"All I gotta say is, I better get to make all the calls I want."
00:21:21.030,00:21:23.407,Gonna be kind of hard.
00:21:28.454,00:21:29.288,Soap?
00:21:31.290,00:21:33.126,I lost my conjugals over soap?
00:21:34.710,00:21:36.796,"You may have lost your conjugals, but I can do you one better."
00:21:36.837,00:21:38.338,I can get you to her.
00:21:38.380,00:21:40.299,To Maricruz?
00:21:40.340,00:21:41.300,That's right.
00:21:41.341,00:21:43.302,"Yeah, and how you gonna do that?"
00:21:44.678,00:21:46.305,We're breaking out of here.
00:21:47.848,00:21:48.141,How?
00:21:49.391,00:21:51.310,Starts in our cell.
00:21:54.396,00:21:58.192,"To tell you the truth, it's already started."
00:21:58.234,00:22:00.527,Ah. Are you crazy?
00:22:00.569,00:22:02.362,You think I want to break out of here?
00:22:02.404,00:22:04.240,"16 months from now, I'm out the gate."
00:22:04.282,00:22:07.160,"I'm getting married, papi, and I'm sure as hell not doing it with no posse on my ass."
00:22:07.201,00:22:09.369,"Man, I ought to beat you six ways till Sunday."
00:22:09.411,00:22:13.373,"I lost my conjugals, pendejo, and all because of your little bar of soap."
00:22:13.415,00:22:14.458,I had to test you.
00:22:14.500,00:22:16.169,See if you could keep a secret.
00:22:16.210,00:22:18.838,You want a secret?
00:22:18.879,00:22:22.341,"You dig in my cell when I'm there, and I'm gonna split your wig."
00:22:31.391,00:22:33.311,LINCOLN: That went well.
00:22:40.818,00:22:43.237,Why don't we start with Lincoln's relationship with your boyfriend?
00:22:43.279,00:22:44.571,LETICIA: Real simple.
00:22:44.613,00:22:47.033,"He owed my man $90,000, and he wasn't getting it done."
00:22:47.074,00:22:48.534,"Then all of a sudden, it gets done."
00:22:48.575,00:22:51.411,"Crab walks in with $90,000 and a big ass smile on his face."
00:22:51.453,00:22:52.412,Who paid him?
00:22:52.454,00:22:54.165,Not Lincoln.
00:22:54.207,00:22:55.333,Who's they?
00:22:57.335,00:22:58.794,"It's all right, Leticia."
00:22:58.836,00:23:00.087,"I told you, you're safe here."
00:23:02.006,00:23:05.383,Crab brought this guy home.
00:23:06.468,00:23:09.347,LETICIA: Crab did what he always did when he was doing big business.
00:23:09.387,00:23:11.557,"He told me to take a walk, so that's exactly what I did."
00:23:11.598,00:23:13.433,"There was something about this guy, though."
00:23:13.475,00:23:15.811,He wasn't the kind of guy Crab usually dealt with.
00:23:15.853,00:23:17.437,What do you mean?
00:23:17.479,00:23:19.481,Couldn't put my finger on it till he went outside.
00:23:19.523,00:23:21.859,LETICIA: Then I knew.
00:23:21.901,00:23:23.443,VERONICA: What look?
00:23:23.485,00:23:24.362,Like they own the place.
00:23:24.402,00:23:26.488,Like they're untouchable.
00:23:27.489,00:23:28.615,Like they're government.
00:23:29.783,00:23:31.409,So the government paid Lincoln's debt?
00:23:32.828,00:23:35.248,VERONICA: Did Crab say what they wanted in return?
00:23:36.249,00:23:37.250,Uh-uh.
00:23:39.001,00:23:40.669,"Uh, just give me a moment to type this up."
00:23:42.755,00:23:44.715,Where are you going?
00:23:44.757,00:23:46.217,This is only gonna take me a minute.
00:23:52.014,00:23:54.474,"No redness or swelling, so there's no sign of infection."
00:23:54.516,00:23:57.186,I'm going to keep you on antibiotics for the next 10 days.
00:23:57.228,00:23:59.355,You should be good.
00:24:01.565,00:24:06.237,"Michael, you understand by law I'm obligated to file a report if I feel there's been prisoner misconduct."
00:24:07.571,00:24:11.575,There's no way this injury happened by stepping on a blade in a garden shed.
00:24:13.286,00:24:14.912,"If you file a report, things could get a lot worse for me."
00:24:14.954,00:24:16.289,They're not already?
00:24:17.373,00:24:20.000,Not compared to what they could be.
00:24:20.042,00:24:21.168,I've made some enemies.
00:24:21.210,00:24:22.378,Yeah.
00:24:23.212,00:24:25.214,You scared?
00:24:27.216,00:24:31.262,"Men. Okay, um, here's what I think."
00:24:31.304,00:24:32.846,I think you are scared.
00:24:34.681,00:24:37.101,And you wouldn't be human if you weren't scared in a place like this.
00:24:39.145,00:24:44.400,"When I was young, I couldn't sleep at night because I thought there was a monster in the closet."
00:24:46.152,00:24:50.364,"But my brother told me there wasn't anything in the closet but fear, and fear wasn't real."
00:24:52.199,00:24:53.700,He said it wasn't made of anything.
00:24:53.742,00:24:56.454,It was just...air.
00:24:56.870,00:24:58.205,Not even that.
00:24:59.623,00:25:01.250,He said you just have to face it.
00:25:01.292,00:25:04.502,"You just have to open that door, and the monster would disappear."
00:25:05.587,00:25:07.214,Your brother sounds like a smart man.
00:25:10.259,00:25:17.391,"In here, though, you face your fear, you open that door, and there's a hundred more doors behind it."
00:25:18.725,00:25:23.521,And the monsters that are hiding behind them are all real.
00:25:25.149,00:25:26.650,"If you want, I could recommend you be sent to Ad Seg."
00:25:27.860,00:25:30.363,With the rape victims and the snitches.
00:25:30.988,00:25:32.448,It would keep you safe.
00:25:34.616,00:25:37.535,But I think I'd like to face the monsters on my own.
00:25:42.749,00:25:44.210,Have a good smoke?
00:25:44.626,00:25:45.627,I don't smoke.
00:25:50.548,00:25:51.384,Didn't mean to startle you.
00:25:53.135,00:25:54.261,"Special Agent Kellerman, Secret Service."
00:25:56.638,00:26:03.396,We've been informed that you obtained a copy of the surveillance tape entered as evidence in the Lincoln Burrows trial.
00:26:04.230,00:26:05.022,Is there a problem with that?
00:26:05.064,00:26:06.982,We're just following up.
00:26:07.024,00:26:11.070,Has there been some amendment to the Freedom of Information Act that I'm not aware of?
00:26:16.783,00:26:21.914,"I'm sorry, I still don't understand why this would be a problem for the Secret Service."
00:26:21.955,00:26:23.541,"Oh, it's not."
00:26:23.581,00:26:29.004,The prosecution made its case far beyond any reasonable doubt and we know that we have the right man.
00:26:29.046,00:26:37.137,"That being said, if you come across anything that could shed some light on his innocence, I'm offering my help."
00:26:38.638,00:26:41.559,Sounds great.
00:26:46.188,00:26:47.689,"Do you have a card, Agent Kellerman?"
00:26:47.731,00:26:48.357,Of course.
00:26:50.608,00:26:52.236,Don't hesitate to call.
00:26:52.694,00:26:53.779,Thanks.
00:27:03.038,00:27:05.207,Leticia.
00:27:33.110,00:27:34.736,"Sebastian, I'm so sorry, I..."
00:27:34.778,00:27:35.695,Where are you?
00:27:35.737,00:27:36.947,I'm sorry...
00:27:38.824,00:27:40.784,This is the time.
00:27:40.826,00:27:43.537,"SEBASTIAN: The coordinator's here, the vendors."
00:27:44.246,00:27:45.372,"Look, I--I, I'm just..."
00:27:45.414,00:27:46.123,"I'm sorry, I--I can't talk right now."
00:28:05.392,00:28:08.312,I say we take his whole foot.
00:28:09.938,00:28:12.316,"ABRUZZI: We could cut off all his limbs, he still wouldn't talk."
00:28:14.527,00:28:16.694,Pain is not the answer here.
00:28:17.988,00:28:20.157,Maybe The Beatles were right after all.
00:28:21.783,00:28:24.244,Maybe all you need is love.
00:28:26.246,00:28:28.332,MICHAEL: What are you doing?
00:28:28.374,00:28:30.626,What does it look like I'm doing?
00:28:31.751,00:28:32.836,You can't do this.
00:28:32.878,00:28:35.130,"I'm done playing your reindeer games, Fish."
00:28:35.172,00:28:37.299,I'm going to transfer to a nice quiet cell with a normal cellie.
00:28:37.341,00:28:40.844,One that doesn't screw my entire life up.
00:28:48.352,00:28:50.854,"Don't do this, please."
00:28:52.189,00:28:54.149,I got 16 months.
00:28:54.191,00:28:55.192,I got a fiancee to think about.
00:28:55.234,00:29:01.615,"I get caught with a hole in my wall, I don't get to see the real world for another five years."
00:29:01.657,00:29:03.116,"Let's go, Sucre."
00:29:03.909,00:29:05.494,I can't do that.
00:29:05.536,00:29:07.246,There's always a solution.
00:29:07.287,00:29:09.540,"Sorry, Fish."
00:29:16.963,00:29:18.757,MAILOR: Can I ask you something?
00:29:20.092,00:29:23.345,Why have you denied any family or loved ones to be there for you in the end?
00:29:23.387,00:29:26.348,Why would I let them watch me die?
00:29:26.390,00:29:28.808,I've caused them enough pain.
00:29:30.102,00:29:31.895,Maybe it's not about them watching you die.
00:29:33.313,00:29:35.441,Maybe it's about me watching them live.
00:29:37.150,00:29:38.068,Is that the final torture?
00:29:38.110,00:29:39.111,No.
00:29:40.362,00:29:42.114,It's about how you want to leave this world.
00:29:42.155,00:29:44.366,What's the last image you want to take with you?
00:29:45.284,00:29:47.286,A stranger?
00:30:02.884,00:30:05.554,Got an issue with our little friend over there?
00:30:05.596,00:30:07.055,I don't gotta come to you.
00:30:07.097,00:30:08.682,You don't give the green light.
00:30:08.724,00:30:10.225,"Everything in here runs through me, you know that."
00:30:10.267,00:30:14.813,Maytag's in the ground because of that piece of detritus.
00:30:15.564,00:30:16.898,So now you want him.
00:30:16.940,00:30:20.068,Every day for the rest of his bid.
00:30:21.403,00:30:23.697,"Seems you and I have something in common, then."
00:30:33.290,00:30:35.959,"ABRUZZI: Easy now, Fish."
00:30:36.001,00:30:38.545,Don't make this any harder than it needs to be.
00:30:38.587,00:30:42.007,"It's time we came to an arrangement, don't you think?"
00:30:55.354,00:31:00.108,"You know, I was thinking I was gonna gut you bow to stern as soon as I laid eyes on you."
00:31:00.150,00:31:05.905,"But, alackaday, you look so pretty when you're scared, don't you?"
00:31:08.950,00:31:12.120,Maybe we ought to get the love out of the way before we move onto the hate.
00:31:12.162,00:31:13.413,"What do you say to that, pretty, hmm?"
00:31:15.165,00:31:16.166,Yeah.
00:31:26.051,00:31:27.511,"God, he talks too much."
00:31:29.763,00:31:31.473,You and I need to have a conversation.
00:31:42.275,00:31:49.533,"What happened in there was my way of saying, uh, I know I've been going about this whole thing the wrong way."
00:31:50.868,00:31:51.910,MAN: We've got a man down.
00:31:53.036,00:31:54.037,I'm trying to make amends here!
00:31:54.079,00:31:55.955,"Come on, we need some help in here!"
00:31:55.997,00:31:57.040,Bygones be bygones.
00:31:57.082,00:31:58.958,"Need a doctor down here, quick!"
00:31:59.000,00:32:00.960,"You're a mercurial man, John."
00:32:01.002,00:32:01.712,I prefer bold.
00:32:03.004,00:32:04.964,"C.O.: Come on, just keep it moving, guys."
00:32:05.006,00:32:05.298,Come on.
00:32:09.010,00:32:10.637,ABRUZZI: Tell me what you need from me.
00:32:10.679,00:32:11.971,A trade.
00:32:12.013,00:32:15.183,You get me a plane and I'll get you Fibonacci.
00:32:16.101,00:32:17.728,What do you need the plane for?
00:32:18.270,00:32:18.729,I think you know.
00:32:20.063,00:32:22.608,"ABRUZZI: I help you, I'm in."
00:32:23.859,00:32:24.943,I do.
00:32:26.027,00:32:28.988,I just gotta know the exact date and time.
00:32:29.030,00:32:30.115,I'll tell you soon enough.
00:32:30.156,00:32:31.700,Soon enough ain't gonna cut it.
00:32:31.742,00:32:34.703,I need to be outside these walls before Fibonacci testifies.
00:32:34.745,00:32:35.954,You will be.
00:32:36.872,00:32:38.540,He testifies in one month.
00:32:38.582,00:32:40.459,Then you'll be out in plenty of time.
00:32:40.500,00:32:44.504,"If not, you're a corpse."
00:32:47.173,00:32:53.012,"So you better cut the crap, tell me the exact date and time, so I can start making the arrangements."
00:32:53.054,00:32:55.014,I don't know if I can trust you with that information yet.
00:32:55.056,00:32:57.392,Why not?
00:33:08.069,00:33:10.029,"Lewis, take these off."
00:33:10.906,00:33:12.073,"Sink, I can't do that."
00:33:12.115,00:33:13.992,"Come on, man, I'm in a cage."
00:33:14.367,00:33:15.160,Ten minutes.
00:33:16.077,00:33:17.078,Please.
00:33:17.704,00:33:19.331,It's my kid.
00:33:34.095,00:33:35.347,"So, here we are."
00:33:38.057,00:33:39.017,Yeah.
00:33:40.101,00:33:41.144,How've you been?
00:33:42.061,00:33:44.230,You know. In trouble.
00:33:45.315,00:33:46.274,How's your mom?
00:33:49.695,00:33:50.737,She's good.
00:33:51.112,00:33:58.119,"Hey, um, I've been talking to the chaplain, and they'd like me to decide on who I should, uh, have at the, uh..."
00:34:00.747,00:34:08.338,"I guess what I'm trying to say is, when you get to the end you start to realize what's important to you."
00:34:09.464,00:34:12.050,"You know, who really matters to you."
00:34:14.344,00:34:18.223,"And, you know, that leaves you and Mike."
00:34:19.641,00:34:23.061,The only blood I got left in this--in this world.
00:34:24.897,00:34:27.524,"Yeah, I, I gotta say I'm not really following what you're saying."
00:34:28.441,00:34:36.157,"Well, uh, in the end, the only thing that matters is love."
00:34:38.201,00:34:40.871,"Blood, family, you."
00:34:48.169,00:34:49.087,Um...
00:34:57.178,00:34:57.637,Give me your hand.
00:34:59.681,00:35:01.391,What are you doing?
00:35:01.433,00:35:04.061,Give me your hand.
00:35:04.770,00:35:06.646,Give me your hand.
00:35:17.240,00:35:19.117,I want you to be there...
00:35:20.243,00:35:21.745,I want you to be there the day before I die.
00:35:25.206,00:35:28.668,"So I can see you, so I can hold you."
00:35:37.302,00:35:42.599,"I, uh, I love you."
00:35:54.027,00:36:01.159,"This whole thing, uh, I don't know if I can take it."
00:36:04.162,00:36:05.163,"Me, either."
00:36:06.247,00:36:08.166,I don't have a choice.
00:36:09.250,00:36:10.168,You do.
00:36:33.274,00:36:35.193,I am so sorry.
00:36:37.236,00:36:40.198,"I met with this woman today, and she knew things about Lincoln's case."
00:36:41.116,00:36:42.200,And then she just disappeared.
00:36:42.241,00:36:43.242,I think something happened to her.
00:36:43.284,00:36:46.287,"Look, I'm gonna make this real easy for you."
00:36:47.831,00:36:51.209,Do you want to get married... or not?
00:36:55.296,00:36:56.422,I don't know.
00:36:56.464,00:36:57.841,Wonderful.
00:37:01.136,00:37:02.554,Maybe we could postpone it.
00:37:02.595,00:37:05.264,"Okay, I can't do this right now."
00:37:05.306,00:37:07.017,It's supposed to be a celebration.
00:37:07.059,00:37:11.813,"If you're really telling me you wanna postpone this thing, then I wanna cancel it."
00:37:18.319,00:37:22.240,"Sebastian, I'm sorry."
00:37:25.035,00:37:25.911,I'll come get my stuff tomorrow.
00:37:59.277,00:37:59.778,BELLICK: Open on 40!
00:38:05.283,00:38:08.661,Scofield.
00:38:08.703,00:38:11.248,"As luck would have it, I found him in Psych Ward."
00:38:11.289,00:38:13.332,"You were the only guy with an empty tray, so..."
00:38:13.374,00:38:14.042,Psych Ward?
00:38:14.084,00:38:16.128,You got a problem with that?
00:38:16.920,00:38:21.091,"'Cause if you do, please feel free to drop it in my suggestion box here."
00:38:30.475,00:38:32.310,"BELLICK: Haywire, get in here."
00:38:37.232,00:38:37.774,Close it up on 40!
00:38:43.780,00:38:46.783,"Oh, and Scofield, just a heads up."
00:38:46.825,00:38:49.494,Don't make eye contact with him.
00:39:16.437,00:39:18.481,"Lincoln, we have a problem."
00:39:19.482,00:39:20.650,I got a new cellmate.
00:39:23.444,00:39:24.612,LINCOLN: That's a problem.
00:39:24.654,00:39:26.739,We're just gonna have to bring him on board.
00:39:26.781,00:39:28.783,You don't bring a guy like that on board.
00:39:28.825,00:39:30.785,"Then I'll work at night, when he's sleeping."
00:39:31.452,00:39:32.871,"10 feet, Scofield."
00:39:40.461,00:39:42.297,How far behind are we?
00:39:43.589,00:39:45.758,Thought you said the margin for error was zero days.
00:39:46.218,00:39:47.302,I did.
00:40:15.080,00:40:16.414,KELLERMAN: Ah.
00:40:17.498,00:40:18.083,Nice out here.
00:40:19.625,00:40:22.587,I got a buddy who's got a place way back up in these woods.
00:40:22.628,00:40:24.463,Come up here hunting around this time of year.
00:40:25.382,00:40:26.424,Man.
00:40:30.428,00:40:30.762,Put her back in. Back in.
00:40:36.976,00:40:38.019,Here. Come here.
00:40:39.979,00:40:41.231,Take her out there.
00:40:41.273,00:40:42.523,She's nothing.
00:40:42.565,00:40:44.817,Nobody would believe her if she talked anyway.
00:40:45.985,00:40:48.363,Hundred yards or so should do it.
00:40:53.368,00:40:54.369,Go!
00:41:10.009,00:41:11.094,I'm sorry.
00:41:12.304,00:41:13.138,You gotta believe me.
00:41:15.432,00:41:16.474,HALE: Damn it.
00:41:41.249,00:41:42.541,Please.
00:41:45.586,00:41:46.671,Please.
00:41:50.383,00:41:51.509,Please.
00:42:03.604,00:42:04.981,Pick up the casings.
00:42:54.155,00:42:56.115,What's your problem?
00:42:57.116,00:43:02.121,I got a neuroanatomic lesion affecting my reticular activating system.
00:43:02.705,00:43:03.956,What does that mean?
00:43:04.665,00:43:06.251,It means I don't sleep.
00:43:08.669,00:43:09.587,At all.
00:00:01.543,00:00:04.129,"MALE NARRATOR: Previously on Prison Break: I didn't kill that man, Michael."
00:00:04.171,00:00:06.465,The evidence says you did.
00:00:06.507,00:00:07.633,I was set up.
00:00:09.969,00:00:11.720,OFFICER: Put down your weapon!
00:00:11.762,00:00:13.430,I find it incumbent that you see the inside of a prison cell.
00:00:13.472,00:00:16.057,I'm looking for someone.
00:00:16.099,00:00:17.935,SUCRE: Man killed the Vice President's brother.
00:00:17.977,00:00:20.479,Why you want to see Burrows so bad anyhow?
00:00:20.521,00:00:21.522,I'm getting you out of here.
00:00:21.563,00:00:22.648,It's impossible.
00:00:22.690,00:00:24.817,"Not if you designed the place, it isn't."
00:00:24.859,00:00:26.067,You've seen the blueprints.
00:00:27.110,00:00:28.320,I've got them on me.
00:00:28.362,00:00:30.405,You find out who's trying to bury him.
00:00:30.447,00:00:31.699,Nobody's trying to bury him.
00:00:31.740,00:00:33.116,The evidence was cooked.
00:00:33.158,00:00:34.660,There's a lawyer poking around.
00:00:34.702,00:00:36.495,Anyone that's a threat is expendable.
00:00:39.456,00:00:41.500,I'm gonna kill that scum.
00:00:41.542,00:00:44.043,"You kill him, you kill our express ticket out of here."
00:00:44.085,00:00:45.295,What are you doing here?
00:00:45.337,00:00:46.505,She's with me now.
00:00:46.547,00:00:48.465,"Fish, I gotta be back in."
00:00:48.507,00:00:49.675,Nick Savrinn with Project Justice.
00:00:49.717,00:00:53.052,"My boss may not think Lincoln's case is worth looking into, but I do."
00:00:54.638,00:00:56.056,When do we get started?
00:00:56.097,00:00:57.850,Getting through this wall is just the beginning.
00:00:57.892,00:01:01.436,There's a whole lot of real estate in between here and the outside walls.
00:01:01.478,00:01:03.313,That is a transfer request.
00:01:03.355,00:01:05.232,Michael Scofield is getting shipped out tomorrow.
00:01:38.181,00:01:41.894,I assume this is about your transfer request for Michael Scofield.
00:01:41.936,00:01:43.353,"More specifically, why you denied it."
00:01:44.438,00:01:48.943,"Look, Mr. Kellerman, do I come into your house and tell you where to put your furniture?"
00:01:50.193,00:01:52.153,We're just asking for a professional courtesy.
00:01:52.195,00:01:54.823,But you're asking for a federal courtesy in a state penitentiary.
00:01:54.865,00:01:58.410,Most people in your position would be happy to have another body taken off their hands.
00:01:58.452,00:01:59.995,These men are my responsibility.
00:02:00.037,00:02:05.709,"From the minute they walk through those walls to the time that they've paid their debt to society, I'm responsible for them."
00:02:05.751,00:02:11.548,"Which means that unless Mr. Scofield has done something I don't know about, he is gonna stay here at Fox River, under my watch."
00:02:12.507,00:02:18.430,"Mr. Pope, in our line of work, we've discovered that just about everyone has done something that someone doesn't know about."
00:02:20.265,00:02:23.435,What's this?
00:02:24.436,00:02:26.480,"Whether it becomes a current event, now, that's up to you."
00:02:32.653,00:02:35.447,My wife already knows about Toledo.
00:02:35.489,00:02:36.615,"Does she, really?"
00:02:43.705,00:02:45.707,"You're a smart man, Warden."
00:02:45.749,00:02:51.672,"I'm sure if you look hard enough, you can find a reason why Michael Scofield's presence is no longer required at this particular correctional facility."
00:03:06.269,00:03:08.063,"I need some more PVC here, boss."
00:03:21.409,00:03:22.953,Boss?
00:03:24.287,00:03:26.247,"But, hey, I'm gonna check your trunk for splinters."
00:03:26.289,00:03:26.707,I want every piece accounted for.
00:03:26.748,00:03:28.542,Sure.
00:03:34.965,00:03:36.299,"Hey, you."
00:03:36.675,00:03:38.218,You.
00:03:39.094,00:03:42.514,Get in there and clean it up before this whole place starts smelling like San Juan.
00:03:47.602,00:03:48.937,"Okay, he's on his way."
00:03:48.979,00:03:51.065,Do you mind telling me what this is all about?
00:03:55.652,00:03:57.571,These are the guys we're breaking out with.
00:03:57.612,00:04:00.448,"I don't think so, Fish."
00:04:00.490,00:04:02.617,That was not our agreement.
00:04:03.827,00:04:05.704,I'm not gonna work with this crazy rhino.
00:04:05.746,00:04:07.622,"Keep pushing it, John."
00:04:07.664,00:04:10.291,"Yeah, I keep pushing it, you know. Huh?"
00:04:10.333,00:04:11.668,"What's your deal, man?"
00:04:12.211,00:04:19.009,"Touch my brother again, I'll show you."
00:04:19.051,00:04:21.678,Brother? Your brother?
00:04:25.933,00:04:27.642,We've only got a few minutes.
00:04:27.684,00:04:31.772,"Are we gonna spend them spitting on each other, or are we gonna talk some business?"
00:04:31.813,00:04:35.067,The reason we're all here today is we have a decision to make.
00:04:35.109,00:04:35.650,ABRUZZI: Yeah?
00:04:35.109,00:04:38.112,"English, Fitz or Percy."
00:04:38.153,00:04:41.281,"If we're gonna pull this off, we need to take one of them out."
00:04:43.283,00:04:45.786,And you want us to tell you which one?
00:04:45.827,00:04:48.080,I just want you to help me get to them.
00:04:48.122,00:04:49.039,I'll take it from there.
00:04:49.081,00:04:49.790,"You're crazy, you know that?"
00:04:49.831,00:04:51.625,All I need is five minutes.
00:04:51.666,00:04:52.960,"Oh, you won't even get five seconds."
00:04:53.001,00:04:55.420,"Thought you had everything worked out, Fish."
00:04:55.462,00:04:58.465,"We're not breaking out of a Jamba Juice, gentlemen."
00:04:58.506,00:04:59.883,It's gonna take a little more than digging a few holes.
00:04:59.925,00:05:03.637,"There are eyes, ears, dots that couldn't be connected from the outside."
00:05:04.846,00:05:06.556,"And English, Fitz and Percy?"
00:05:06.598,00:05:08.475,One of those dots.
00:05:10.811,00:05:13.814,And how exactly are you supposed to pull this off?
00:05:15.232,00:05:17.151,With a little help from my friends.
00:05:48.431,00:05:51.977,"Why do I get the feeling that there's more to you than meets the eye, Scofield?"
00:05:53.854,00:05:56.439,Anything you wanna tell me?
00:05:58.817,00:06:03.780,Some other reason you're in here besides holding up a bank?
00:06:15.000,00:06:17.627,You're being transferred.
00:06:17.669,00:06:18.753,What?
00:06:18.795,00:06:20.797,We're moving you over to Statesville.
00:06:21.464,00:06:22.590,You can't do that.
00:06:22.632,00:06:23.842,"Yes, I can."
00:06:23.884,00:06:25.969,This is my house.
00:06:27.971,00:06:29.056,Three weeks.
00:06:30.473,00:06:31.474,Lincoln Burrows.
00:06:32.559,00:06:34.393,He's being executed in three weeks.
00:06:35.478,00:06:36.688,"Well, I'm aware of that."
00:06:37.689,00:06:38.773,He's my brother.
00:06:41.484,00:06:44.863,"When I knew I was being sent to prison, my attorney petitioned the DOC."
00:06:44.905,00:06:47.448,So you could be near him.
00:06:47.490,00:06:48.575,That's right.
00:06:51.578,00:06:52.913,Don't take that away from me.
00:06:54.664,00:06:55.999,Not until it's over.
00:06:57.167,00:06:59.378,I'm not the one behind the transfer.
00:07:00.170,00:07:01.671,You're up against much bigger fish than me.
00:07:05.175,00:07:06.968,I'll arrange for you to say goodbye.
00:07:08.178,00:07:09.804,You ship out tomorrow.
00:08:37.558,00:08:38.977,I'm going into the walls tonight.
00:08:39.019,00:08:40.561,See if I can access the roof.
00:08:40.603,00:08:42.563,You gonna tell me about the transfer?
00:08:43.440,00:08:44.899,I'm taking care of it.
00:08:44.941,00:08:46.026,You're taking care of it?
00:08:46.067,00:08:49.070,Sounds to me like you're reaching.
00:08:49.612,00:08:50.530,Maybe.
00:08:51.031,00:08:52.032,A little.
00:08:52.073,00:08:53.533,A little.
00:08:55.076,00:08:56.036,"You know, I'd made my peace with what was coming."
00:09:01.624,00:09:03.960,Hope. And now that's gonna be taken away.
00:09:04.002,00:09:06.963,"Don't do this, Linc."
00:09:07.005,00:09:08.465,What do you want me to do?
00:09:08.798,00:09:09.966,Hmm?
00:09:14.804,00:09:15.596,"YOUNG LINCOLN: Come on, Michael."
00:09:15.638,00:09:17.765,What do you want me to do?
00:09:19.142,00:09:20.143,Bring her back.
00:09:21.644,00:09:23.271,You know I can't do that.
00:09:24.647,00:09:26.816,"But, look, there's some stuff that I can do."
00:09:28.568,00:09:30.404,"It's not gonna be the same, but we're gonna figure it out."
00:09:30.445,00:09:33.573,"And no matter what, it's still gonna be me and you."
00:09:35.658,00:09:39.079,Okay. But what if something happens to you?
00:09:40.830,00:09:43.458,You just have a little faith.
00:09:51.383,00:09:53.009,Just have a little faith.
00:09:57.472,00:09:58.890,"NICK: All right, here's the deal."
00:09:58.932,00:10:00.641,"If we believe Lincoln, this tape is a lie."
00:10:00.683,00:10:02.018,It has to be.
00:10:02.060,00:10:03.603,But you saw it.
00:10:03.644,00:10:05.480,"Yeah, but maybe what we're looking for is what's not there."
00:10:08.233,00:10:09.526,Okay. Steadman.
00:10:09.568,00:10:11.986,You see?
00:10:12.820,00:10:14.072,"VERONICA: A car, a pedestrian."
00:10:15.365,00:10:16.408,It's like he's looking right into the camera.
00:10:16.450,00:10:18.618,He might as well be saying cheese.
00:10:21.037,00:10:22.414,Now he just sits there.
00:10:22.456,00:10:24.874,"Like 10, 15 seconds, as if he was maybe..."
00:10:24.916,00:10:26.626,Waiting for someone.
00:10:28.462,00:10:30.213,There. That's a 9 mm.
00:10:30.255,00:10:31.423,Shouldn't there be some kind of kick or something?
00:10:31.465,00:10:33.674,Lincoln's pretty strong.
00:10:33.716,00:10:35.552,"Yeah, but strong enough to bury a recoil?"
00:10:35.594,00:10:44.185,"Now, you shoot someone, supposedly for revenge, do you take the time to go back in and hit the glove box, or do you just get the hell out of there?"
00:10:44.227,00:10:46.605,Feds said he was trying to make it look like a robbery.
00:10:48.356,00:10:49.566,Look.
00:10:49.608,00:10:52.902,Look at Lincoln's angle as he leaves the frame.
00:10:53.320,00:10:53.445,Mmm.
00:10:54.737,00:10:56.573,Walks away from the car.
00:10:56.615,00:11:03.079,"Now this guy, who conveniently hides his face from the camera, he comes back in. Why?"
00:11:03.121,00:11:06.541,To explain the bloody pants they'd already planted in his apartment.
00:11:06.583,00:11:08.042,"Nick, this is great."
00:11:09.461,00:11:09.961,Who should we go to?
00:11:10.003,00:11:11.379,Nobody. Yet.
00:11:11.421,00:11:14.882,"I mean, to the unbiased eye, we're just backing a horse that died in the gate."
00:11:14.924,00:11:16.717,A lot of what-ifs and conjecture.
00:11:16.759,00:11:18.719,"You know, we don't have anything."
00:11:18.761,00:11:27.020,"Look, if--if Lincoln didn't fire this gun, then somebody with some serious skills went to work on this tape to prove that he did."
00:11:30.565,00:11:31.525,You know a guy?
00:11:31.566,00:11:34.027,"Yeah, I know a guy."
00:11:34.902,00:11:36.237,Thanks.
00:11:37.364,00:11:38.739,Seems we need to have another powwow.
00:11:38.781,00:11:41.326,There's been talk about you packing your bags.
00:11:41.368,00:11:42.410,Don't believe everything you hear.
00:11:42.452,00:11:44.703,I'm not going anywhere.
00:11:48.542,00:11:51.628,"You know, I have a really hard time trusting you, Fish."
00:11:52.795,00:11:54.589,The important thing is that we stay on schedule.
00:11:55.382,00:11:56.757,"Yeah? English, Fitz or Percy?"
00:11:56.799,00:11:58.343,"English, Fitz or Percy."
00:11:58.385,00:12:00.761,You wanna know which one I think we should take out?
00:12:00.803,00:12:02.721,"All due respect, I don't need opinions."
00:12:02.763,00:12:05.183,I need answers.
00:12:05.225,00:12:06.767,"Remember, the warden leaves at 5:00 tonight."
00:12:06.809,00:12:09.270,"So by 5:05, we're gonna need that key."
00:12:09.312,00:12:12.148,And how is this key gonna give you the answers?
00:12:12.190,00:12:13.774,I'll worry about that.
00:12:13.816,00:12:14.526,You worry about getting the key.
00:12:14.568,00:12:19.406,"Hey, this key better be worth it."
00:12:19.447,00:12:20.739,Understand?
00:12:26.413,00:12:29.583,"Afternoon, Mr. Scofield."
00:12:29.624,00:12:33.336,I need to know if there's any way to block a transfer order.
00:12:33.378,00:12:35.296,There's about 50 ways.
00:12:35.338,00:12:37.215,All right.
00:12:37.840,00:12:42.178,You file a motion for what they call an interlocutory injunction.
00:12:42.220,00:12:43.388,How long does that take?
00:12:43.430,00:12:45.139,How fast can you write?
00:12:45.181,00:12:47.766,A man can claim almost anything violates his constitutional rights.
00:12:49.519,00:12:53.106,"There's, uh, environmental issues, allergies, religious requirements."
00:12:53.147,00:12:54.899,Take your pick.
00:12:54.941,00:12:57.776,Don't matter.
00:12:57.818,00:13:00.154,"Till they do, you can't be transferred."
00:13:00.196,00:13:04.576,"Hell, they've been trying to move my tired gray behind for 10 years."
00:13:04.618,00:13:07.495,God bless the American legal system.
00:13:08.705,00:13:10.540,Why do you want to stay in here so badly?
00:13:11.874,00:13:14.335,There's someone here I can't bear to leave behind.
00:13:15.712,00:13:18.214,I guess that means we got something in common.
00:13:19.840,00:13:21.884,The State's requiring a physical for Lincoln Burrows.
00:13:21.926,00:13:23.720,"You heard the news, didn't you?"
00:13:23.762,00:13:24.845,"No, what?"
00:13:24.887,00:13:26.264,They're brothers.
00:13:26.306,00:13:27.932,Who?
00:13:29.309,00:13:30.644,Michael Scofield?
00:13:30.685,00:13:32.937,Heard it from one of the CO's over in Gen Pop.
00:13:32.979,00:13:34.355,He didn't say anything to you about it?
00:13:34.397,00:13:36.065,No.
00:13:36.107,00:13:41.070,"Well, it must be hard to be here so close to your brother and not be able to do anything to help him."
00:13:49.120,00:13:51.372,What's this?
00:13:51.414,00:13:52.873,Westmoreland again?
00:13:52.915,00:13:54.959,Scofield.
00:13:58.379,00:14:03.176,"Even if the motion is denied, it's gonna take 30 days to process."
00:14:03.217,00:14:04.260,And that means...
00:14:07.180,00:14:09.223,"All right, I'm going in."
00:14:09.265,00:14:10.891,I'm gonna need your help.
00:14:10.933,00:14:13.353,You mean in in? Now?
00:14:13.394,00:14:17.482,"I need to make sure I know how I'm getting up there, so when the time comes..."
00:14:18.941,00:14:20.193,"In case you hadn't noticed, the lights are all on."
00:14:21.319,00:14:22.362,"You got a live studio audience, Fish."
00:14:22.403,00:14:24.155,How you gonna get around that?
00:14:25.532,00:14:27.200,Don't we have some laundry to do?
00:14:32.955,00:14:37.335,"Just to be clear, I ain't touching your drawers."
00:14:47.970,00:14:49.096,Eyes straight ahead.
00:14:49.138,00:14:50.390,GUARD: Let's go!
00:14:50.973,00:14:52.475,Keep it moving.
00:14:52.517,00:14:53.518,GUARD: Eyes to the front.
00:14:53.560,00:14:55.102,"Keep it moving, keep it moving."
00:14:55.144,00:14:56.604,Him.
00:15:16.708,00:15:17.917,Get up.
00:15:24.382,00:15:26.300,GUARD: March.
00:15:26.342,00:15:36.394,Come on.
00:15:36.394,00:16:29.614,Come on.
00:16:29.656,00:16:33.493,Fish? I can't deal with this.
00:17:13.366,00:17:14.367,Fish.
00:17:15.576,00:17:17.453,Come on.
00:17:30.925,00:17:33.970,"Yo, Fish. Fish, you're taking too long, bro."
00:18:02.623,00:18:04.124,"SUCRE: This ain't gonna fly, man."
00:18:04.166,00:18:07.628,"The Ricans, we got genetically higher blood pressure, you know that?"
00:18:07.670,00:18:10.297,"My cousin, he died from too much stress."
00:18:10.339,00:18:12.008,I thought you said your cousin was moving in on your girl.
00:18:12.050,00:18:15.845,That's my other cousin.
00:18:15.887,00:18:20.016,"Look, the good news is I can get to the roof."
00:18:20.058,00:18:22.142,So what happens now?
00:18:22.184,00:18:25.104,"Now, it's all about timing."
00:18:59.221,00:19:02.182,This is a top dollar job.
00:19:02.224,00:19:03.684,No. Do you?
00:19:05.144,00:19:06.854,"People who do this kind of work are ghosts, man."
00:19:06.896,00:19:09.690,The guy behind the guy behind the guy.
00:19:09.732,00:19:11.692,You see anything?
00:19:11.734,00:19:14.070,Any place that proves the tape might have been doctored?
00:19:14.112,00:19:15.905,The thing's clean.
00:19:15.947,00:19:19.867,"I mean, usually you peel the video back a couple of layers, anything bogus comes off."
00:19:19.909,00:19:21.577,"You know, now you see it, and now you don't."
00:19:21.619,00:19:23.162,But not this one.
00:19:24.246,00:19:25.498,Ingrained.
00:19:27.667,00:19:29.710,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:19:29.752,00:19:33.006,No.
00:19:33.047,00:19:35.508,But your ears...
00:19:38.260,00:19:41.388,There.
00:19:41.430,00:19:42.598,But noise is alive.
00:19:42.640,00:19:44.892,"See, it doesn't just die like that."
00:19:46.268,00:19:47.269,"Stripped down, those levels should be dancing."
00:19:47.311,00:19:52.608,"A room that size would give you a--a blam, blam, blam, blam, you know."
00:19:52.650,00:19:55.402,"Like one off each wall, a split second after the other."
00:19:55.444,00:19:58.865,"On yours, the reverb's bouncing at the same time."
00:20:00.324,00:20:01.742,The sound of the gunshot.
00:20:02.743,00:20:04.495,It wasn't recorded in that room.
00:20:10.626,00:20:12.211,I don't know.
00:20:12.252,00:20:13.462,"I mean, the tape you gave me is a dupe."
00:20:13.504,00:20:15.089,"You know, for all I know, you guys tampered with it."
00:20:15.131,00:20:20.887,"Look, you want me to testify in court, I'm gonna need to get my hands on the original."
00:20:24.306,00:20:26.433,POPE: How are those allergies?
00:20:26.475,00:20:27.810,Excuse me?
00:20:29.020,00:20:31.564,"In your motion, you cited chronic, uh..."
00:20:31.605,00:20:33.273,Sinusitis.
00:20:33.733,00:20:34.775,"It's not an allergy, actually."
00:20:34.817,00:20:37.611,It's a bacterial infection.
00:20:37.653,00:20:43.701,"The moist air from the river along the east wall helps keep me, you know, clear."
00:20:43.743,00:20:46.162,I'm impressed.
00:20:43.743,00:20:48.372,Not even a week in here and you're already working it like an old con.
00:20:48.414,00:20:50.290,"Well, you've got one up on me, Warden."
00:20:50.332,00:20:55.254,"You know why I needed to file those motions, but I have no idea why you needed to transfer me."
00:20:56.338,00:20:57.423,"Traffic control, Scofield, that's all."
00:20:57.464,00:20:58.883,Traffic control.
00:20:59.717,00:21:00.593,"Look, it's coming up on 5:00."
00:21:00.634,00:21:02.302,What do you say we call it a day?
00:21:02.344,00:21:03.888,"I don't think I can do that, sir."
00:21:03.930,00:21:05.264,Why not?
00:21:05.305,00:21:08.308,"If I let go of this support right now, the whole thing is coming down."
00:21:08.350,00:21:11.187,"See, the Taj was designed using axial force."
00:21:11.229,00:21:14.398,A series of internal forces along the longitudinal axis...
00:21:14.440,00:21:16.442,Yeah. How much longer?
00:21:16.483,00:21:18.527,Depends on how long it takes to dry.
00:21:19.361,00:21:22.615,"If you need me to leave, I can show your secretary how to hold it."
00:21:22.656,00:21:24.158,"All right, you can stay till it dries."
00:21:24.200,00:21:25.785,There'll be a guard waiting outside the door.
00:21:25.826,00:21:29.413,Just check in with Becky when you're done and she'll have somebody escort you back to your cell.
00:21:29.455,00:21:31.791,All right.
00:21:34.418,00:21:36.587,I wanna thank you for showing up today.
00:21:38.380,00:21:40.340,We had a deal.
00:21:40.382,00:21:41.801,Right.
00:21:41.842,00:21:42.551,"Still, thanks."
00:21:42.593,00:21:45.096,My wife is gonna love it.
00:21:45.138,00:21:46.931,You're welcome.
00:21:57.650,00:21:59.359,"PATTERSON: See you tomorrow, sir."
00:21:59.401,00:22:00.903,"BECKY: Good night, Warden."
00:22:03.405,00:22:13.207,We just happen to be two people who happen to know each other and happen to show up at the same movie theater at what happens to be the same time.
00:22:14.416,00:22:16.043,PATTERSON: That's it.
00:22:53.664,00:22:57.543,"You know, from this angle, you look just as good as you did when we first met."
00:22:57.584,00:22:59.753,How about from this one?
00:22:59.795,00:23:00.838,Even better.
00:23:05.509,00:23:06.426,Those are for your guests.
00:23:06.468,00:23:08.386,Guests?
00:23:09.763,00:23:12.390,They said you had a meeting.
00:24:07.529,00:24:09.782,POPE: There's nothing I can do.
00:24:11.533,00:24:15.246,"I'm legally obligated to file every properly drafted motion with the court, so that a hearing can be scheduled."
00:24:15.288,00:24:16.496,And how long does that take?
00:24:16.538,00:24:17.831,"A month, maybe two if there's a logjam."
00:24:19.083,00:24:20.584,"I'm sorry, but it's out of my hands."
00:24:20.626,00:24:23.503,Why do I get the feeling you're not all that disappointed?
00:24:23.545,00:24:25.589,"May I ask you a question, Warden?"
00:24:26.590,00:24:28.466,"More of an observation, really."
00:24:29.593,00:24:33.973,"I was looking at the morgue, uh, photos of that boy back in Toledo, Will Clayton."
00:24:34.014,00:24:37.684,"And, my Lord, if he wasn't the spitting image of his daddy."
00:24:40.562,00:24:43.399,"Apple fell real far from the tree with that one, didn't it?"
00:24:44.566,00:24:45.525,It fell off the tree.
00:24:45.567,00:24:47.569,Fell all over the pavement.
00:24:48.446,00:24:49.529,You son of a bitch.
00:24:49.571,00:24:51.740,Your wife gave you a pass on the affair.
00:24:53.033,00:24:55.786,But something tells me that's pretty much all the forgiveness she's got left in her bag.
00:24:59.081,00:25:02.584,"What happened with young Will, Warden?"
00:25:02.626,00:25:04.795,Get out of my house.
00:25:04.837,00:25:06.672,Lose Scofield's paperwork.
00:25:08.090,00:25:09.967,You gentlemen staying for dinner?
00:25:10.009,00:25:11.885,"Thanks, but I think we're on our way."
00:25:11.927,00:25:15.555,"Judy, it was a real pleasure."
00:25:15.597,00:25:17.766,And that just may have been the best iced tea I've ever had.
00:25:20.144,00:25:21.519,"Warden, better do everything you can to hold on to this one."
00:25:22.980,00:25:24.564,I will.
00:25:24.606,00:25:25.816,Good.
00:25:29.945,00:25:31.780,Is everything all right?
00:25:31.822,00:25:33.531,"Oh, yeah. Just fine, I, uh..."
00:25:34.158,00:25:37.036,I just have a little unfinished work to take care of.
00:25:37.077,00:25:39.079,I'll be right in.
00:25:39.205,00:25:40.998,Okay.
00:26:19.786,00:26:21.163,He's all clear.
00:26:22.415,00:26:23.707,"Good evening, Lincoln."
00:26:23.832,00:26:25.292,Doctor.
00:26:25.334,00:26:27.961,"I'm, uh, supposed to give you a physical this evening."
00:26:29.587,00:26:32.341,Let me apologize in advance for the heavy dose of irony we're about to participate in.
00:26:32.383,00:26:35.052,That's all right.
00:26:35.719,00:26:41.599,"Yeah, well, letting the State know that you're healthy enough to execute is not why I went to medical school."
00:26:42.684,00:26:43.936,I apologize.
00:26:43.977,00:26:45.187,That's okay.
00:26:49.233,00:26:50.692,All right.
00:26:50.734,00:26:54.905,"I'm, uh, going to need a family medical history from you."
00:26:54.947,00:26:58.284,Any ailments or conditions that are hereditary.
00:26:58.325,00:26:59.577,Start with your mom.
00:26:59.617,00:27:01.703,"Uh, cancer. Liver."
00:27:01.745,00:27:03.247,Okay. Father?
00:27:04.123,00:27:05.749,"Mmm, split when I was young."
00:27:07.667,00:27:08.752,Siblings.
00:27:09.962,00:27:11.171,Anyone besides Michael?
00:27:13.924,00:27:16.634,"Fox River's a small town, Lincoln."
00:27:18.720,00:27:20.638,People around here don't have a whole lot to do besides time and talk.
00:27:21.723,00:27:23.016,You close?
00:27:26.145,00:27:27.645,LINCOLN: We were.
00:27:29.815,00:27:31.900,How about now?
00:27:31.942,00:27:33.277,Huh?
00:27:33.319,00:27:34.403,How about now?
00:27:38.407,00:27:40.159,He's been abandoned his whole life.
00:27:40.909,00:27:42.702,Dad. Mom.
00:27:42.744,00:27:45.331,She died young.
00:27:45.747,00:27:49.209,And now me.
00:27:49.251,00:27:50.710,Think that's why he's here?
00:27:51.378,00:27:53.297,'Cause your...
00:27:53.339,00:27:55.673,Your death would feel like it's happening again?
00:27:57.176,00:27:59.178,I abandoned him a long time ago.
00:27:59.219,00:28:01.138,That's why he's here.
00:28:28.248,00:28:29.707,GUARD: Gates closing!
00:28:31.918,00:28:33.170,It's time.
00:28:34.796,00:28:35.589,Time?
00:28:35.631,00:28:37.132,"Oh, God, here we go again."
00:28:37.174,00:28:39.051,Count's in 15 minutes.
00:28:39.092,00:28:41.928,"Trust me, the less you know, the better."
00:28:41.970,00:28:42.929,The less I know...
00:28:42.971,00:28:44.890,"Man, you got me in the dark."
00:28:44.931,00:28:46.725,That's exactly where you want to be.
00:28:52.398,00:28:54.941,BEN: Don't normally find you here at this hour.
00:28:56.318,00:29:00.406,Are you seeking his forgiveness or advice?
00:29:02.533,00:29:04.034,"I really don't know anymore, Ben."
00:29:05.369,00:29:11.375,All I know is my son Will was my responsibility.
00:29:12.834,00:29:14.794,"And if I'd stayed in his life, I could have saved his life."
00:29:14.836,00:29:17.172,"His death was an accident, Henry."
00:29:21.635,00:29:24.763,He was a criminal and an addict.
00:29:25.805,00:29:28.141,But he was only 18 years old.
00:29:28.183,00:29:33.063,His mother made it clear you couldn't be in his life if you weren't going to be in hers.
00:29:33.105,00:29:36.233,"When you chose to stay with Judy, you understood that."
00:29:37.610,00:29:39.528,"I not only understood it, I was grateful for it."
00:29:41.071,00:29:44.617,I--I told myself I--I was respecting her wishes.
00:29:45.867,00:29:59.381,"I cursed her under my breath, while every day I thanked God for allowing me to wash my hands of her, of Toledo, all of it. I..."
00:30:02.301,00:30:09.558,So I ran home to Judy and I buried the secret.
00:30:11.602,00:30:17.857,But I never got a chance to bury my--my son.
00:30:30.912,00:30:33.290,"What kind of a person does that, Ben?"
00:30:34.207,00:30:38.837,Sacrifices somebody else's life just to make their own life easier.
00:30:42.424,00:30:44.301,You can argue with me all night.
00:30:44.343,00:30:46.886,"Believe me, I haven't got anything better to do."
00:30:46.928,00:30:52.142,But it won't change the fact that I can't just hand out original copies of evidence.
00:30:52.184,00:30:53.893,If you could just take a look...
00:30:53.935,00:30:57.439,"I don't care if your FOIL was signed by the Attorney General, I can't give it to you."
00:30:57.481,00:30:58.940,What if we brought somebody here to watch it?
00:30:58.982,00:31:01.777,Your supervisor could monitor them the entire time.
00:31:01.819,00:31:03.570,"He'd strip down, swear on a stack of Bibles, whatever it takes."
00:31:03.612,00:31:06.865,"Wait, what did you say the docket number was?"
00:31:07.949,00:31:10.910,"It's, uh, 296-SPE."
00:31:10.952,00:31:12.078,Oh.
00:31:12.746,00:31:13.580,What's wrong?
00:31:13.622,00:31:15.081,Come with me.
00:31:19.545,00:31:24.341,"Last night a pipe burst upstairs, flooded the place."
00:31:24.383,00:31:26.134,Files from over a hundred cases.
00:31:26.176,00:31:28.387,"Pretty much lost all of them, including yours."
00:31:29.971,00:31:31.306,Just this room?
00:31:31.348,00:31:32.558,Some kind of freak accident.
00:31:45.070,00:31:46.946,GUARD: Count them.
00:31:46.988,00:31:48.365,"BELLICK: Callahan, Knight."
00:31:50.367,00:31:52.369,"Malinowski, Pohlen."
00:32:37.372,00:32:39.082,"Chance, Graziano."
00:32:40.876,00:32:41.877,"Scofield, Sucre."
00:32:50.051,00:32:53.972,"Scofield, get the hell out here."
00:33:04.483,00:33:05.984,We got a runner!
00:33:22.584,00:33:23.710,GUARD: Lockdown!
00:33:24.085,00:33:26.004,Lockdown!
00:33:37.975,00:33:41.019,"All right, for the last time, pinata."
00:33:41.060,00:33:43.396,Where the hell is Scofield?
00:33:43.438,00:33:45.440,"He's gone, you're gone."
00:33:46.316,00:33:47.108,"PATTERSON: Call it off, Captain."
00:33:47.150,00:33:49.528,I got Scofield right here.
00:33:49.569,00:33:50.529,Where?
00:33:50.570,00:33:52.030,In the warden's office.
00:33:53.114,00:33:54.324,You looking at him?
00:33:56.117,00:33:58.787,Stop trying to nail the secretary and check the damn office!
00:34:06.336,00:34:09.548,"Captain, he's gone."
00:35:10.191,00:35:13.070,"The man can't just vanish, Deputy."
00:35:13.111,00:35:14.446,He never checked out with you?
00:35:14.487,00:35:16.155,And the rear door?
00:35:16.197,00:35:17.950,How the hell did he...
00:35:18.408,00:35:20.702,What's going on?
00:35:20.744,00:35:26.165,You're in the Warden's office after hours. I could kill you and the paperwork wouldn't need much more than the date.
00:35:26.207,00:35:27.459,"Tell me, what were you doing in here?"
00:35:27.500,00:35:29.127,"All right, Deputy, that's enough."
00:35:32.422,00:35:33.673,The work wasn't dry.
00:35:33.715,00:35:35.258,You said to stay until it was.
00:35:35.300,00:35:37.176,You were in here the whole time?
00:35:37.218,00:35:39.596,It's true.
00:35:39.638,00:35:41.640,I must not have seen him behind the table.
00:35:41.681,00:35:43.349,"Warden, all due respect, this is ridiculous."
00:35:43.391,00:35:45.894,This prisoner was out of his cell.
00:35:49.106,00:35:50.649,"The thing is, Mr. Scofield is not our problem anymore."
00:35:52.025,00:35:53.359,It seems there was an error in his paperwork.
00:35:55.403,00:35:56.738,That's not possible.
00:35:57.906,00:35:59.658,Escort the prisoner back to his cell.
00:36:00.659,00:36:02.577,"Warden, all I need is three weeks."
00:36:02.619,00:36:04.704,Get off me!
00:36:04.746,00:36:07.415,"Henry, please, just a little time."
00:36:07.457,00:36:09.292,Just give me the time.
00:36:12.629,00:36:15.298,Any chance you wanna write this off as a coincidence?
00:36:15.924,00:36:17.383,Me neither.
00:36:17.425,00:36:19.427,How could they have known we were coming for the tape?
00:36:19.469,00:36:20.386,"Three hours ago, we didn't even know."
00:36:20.428,00:36:23.348,"Well, we're pissing someone off."
00:36:23.389,00:36:25.642,You say that like it's a good thing.
00:36:25.684,00:36:28.478,"People start breaking the law, you know you're getting warm."
00:36:31.606,00:36:34.484,"We still have our copy of the tape, so maybe..."
00:36:38.905,00:36:40.532,Nick.
00:36:58.424,00:36:59.926,Whoever it was is gone.
00:37:01.053,00:37:01.887,Does it look like they got anything?
00:37:01.928,00:37:03.221,No.
00:37:09.102,00:37:11.604,Everything's exactly the way I left it.
00:37:21.322,00:37:22.657,What? What?
00:37:26.327,00:37:27.453,What?
00:37:27.495,00:37:29.414,The tape. It's gone.
00:37:29.455,00:37:31.290,How could they know?
00:37:31.332,00:37:32.751,How could they know exactly where to look?
00:37:32.792,00:37:34.460,"Wait, does anyone else have a key to this place?"
00:37:34.502,00:37:36.337,No.
00:37:36.379,00:37:37.630,"You were here, remember?"
00:37:38.423,00:37:41.676,"I was talking to you, I walked toward the cabinet, and I s-said..."
00:37:44.679,00:37:45.889,What?
00:37:47.807,00:37:50.227,"Veronica, are you okay?"
00:37:55.857,00:37:57.192,Veronica.
00:38:06.492,00:38:07.827,BELLICK: Open up!
00:38:08.912,00:38:12.331,"Breakfast, gentlemen."
00:38:12.373,00:38:14.375,"Sucre, let's go."
00:38:14.417,00:38:16.836,I'm sure your ride will be along any minute now.
00:38:24.928,00:38:26.221,This can't be it.
00:38:27.513,00:38:28.598,It can't end like this.
00:38:28.640,00:38:31.309,BELLICK: Let's move it!
00:38:32.102,00:38:33.311,SCOFIELD: Fitz.
00:38:34.395,00:38:35.354,What?
00:38:35.396,00:38:37.065,We were gonna take Fitz out.
00:38:38.399,00:38:39.943,It was as clear as day.
00:38:45.406,00:38:47.033,You got all the timing down?
00:38:51.412,00:38:52.914,Think we would have made it?
00:38:55.875,00:38:57.669,"Sucre, now."
00:39:44.090,00:40:11.534,"' Well, I had a dream ' ' I stood beneath an orange sky ' ' Yes, I had a dream ' ' I stood beneath an orange sky ' Hey, fish-face, where you going?"
00:40:11.576,00:40:26.465,' With my brother standing by ' ' With my brother standing by ' Call my wife.
00:40:24.381,00:40:28.467,Tell her to get the kids and get the hell out of the country.
00:40:30.511,00:40:45.360,"' I said Brother, you know, you know ' ' It's a long road we've been walking on ' Sorry."
00:40:45.402,00:41:08.800,' Brother you know it is you know it is ' ' Such a long road we've been walking on '' Don't forget to buckle up.
00:41:12.804,00:41:14.222,POPE: What's this prisoner doing out of his cell?
00:41:14.264,00:41:16.599,GUARD: He's being transferred.
00:41:18.143,00:41:20.019,"No, no, no, no."
00:41:20.061,00:41:21.604,This man filed a motion yesterday.
00:41:21.646,00:41:24.357,He has a medical condition which precludes transfer.
00:41:24.399,00:41:26.484,"Sinusitis, right?"
00:41:27.568,00:41:28.736,Sinusitis.
00:41:30.155,00:41:31.530,Take the prisoner back to his cell.
00:41:31.572,00:41:34.492,But yank his rec time.
00:42:16.159,00:42:20.872,"Hey, you're home early."
00:42:21.622,00:42:23.916,"Yeah. Yeah, it is."
00:42:25.626,00:42:27.545,"There's just, um..."
00:42:32.133,00:42:33.385,Judy.
00:42:38.597,00:42:40.558,There's someone I need to tell you about.
00:42:44.562,00:42:46.605,WOMAN: Yes?
00:42:46.647,00:42:48.649,KELLERMAN: The transfer did not go through.
00:42:48.691,00:42:49.567,That's disappointing.
00:42:50.735,00:42:52.404,"We can re-file, but the warden..."
00:42:52.445,00:42:53.821,It's a waste of time.
00:42:55.614,00:43:00.578,"I think it's time we stopped beating around the bush, gentlemen, and go after the damn bush!"
00:43:01.620,00:43:02.580,Burrows.
00:43:03.540,00:43:05.624,What do you want done?
00:43:05.666,00:43:08.794,WOMAN: Take the only thing Burrows has left. Time.
00:43:08.836,00:43:13.258,"After all, the chair isn't the only way to take a man's life in prison."
00:00:01.669,00:00:06.047,"FEMALE NARRATOR: Previously on Prison Break: I didn't kill that man, Michael."
00:00:06.089,00:00:07.132,I was set up.
00:00:09.259,00:00:10.886,OFFICER: Put down your weapon.
00:00:10.928,00:00:13.347,I find it incumbent that you see the inside of a prison cell.
00:00:13.388,00:00:15.724,I'm looking for someone.
00:00:15.766,00:00:17.601,SUCRE: Man killed the Vice President's brother.
00:00:17.643,00:00:20.061,Why you want to see Burrows so bad anyhow?
00:00:20.103,00:00:22.189,I'm getting you out of here.
00:00:22.230,00:00:24.358,"Not if you designed the place, it isn't."
00:00:24.733,00:00:27.027,You've seen the blueprints.
00:00:28.362,00:00:30.071,KELLERMAN: There's a lawyer poking around.
00:00:30.113,00:00:33.200,Miss Donovan.
00:00:33.241,00:00:36.036,It's gone.
00:00:36.077,00:00:39.122,"You were here, remember?"
00:00:46.254,00:00:49.466,Got an issue with our little friend over there?
00:00:49.508,00:00:53.178,"Yeah, maybe it's time I lit up that leather once and for all, huh?"
00:00:53.220,00:00:55.096,What happened?
00:00:55.138,00:00:57.725,Don't make me lie to you.
00:00:57.766,00:00:59.184,"You heard the news, didn't you?"
00:00:59.226,00:01:01.687,They're brothers.
00:01:01.854,00:01:03.146,Burrows and Scofield.
00:01:03.188,00:01:05.273,Michael Scofield?
00:01:05.315,00:01:07.108,I'm going into the walls tonight.
00:01:07.150,00:01:08.235,See if I can access the roof.
00:01:08.276,00:01:10.278,Take the only thing Burrows has left.
00:01:10.320,00:01:13.281,The chair isn't the only way to take a man's life in prison.
00:01:30.215,00:01:32.676,Just a few more rides.
00:01:32.718,00:01:34.302,Then you have to wrap it up.
00:01:38.057,00:01:40.517,"Uh, Adam's getting bigger, huh? Ten."
00:01:41.476,00:01:42.352,Not here.
00:01:43.228,00:01:44.521,We need a favor.
00:01:45.981,00:01:47.524,Been out of the life for years.
00:01:47.566,00:01:56.366,"I know. Problem is, Diamond, no one's gonna believe that if I take the heroin I have in my pocket and put it in the glove box of the reasonably-priced minivan you've got parked over there."
00:01:57.034,00:01:58.159,I will cuff you.
00:01:58.201,00:02:00.412,I will drag you out of here in front of everyone.
00:02:05.667,00:02:07.127,What do you need?
00:02:10.464,00:02:21.433,"PRESIDENT: What America needs is an environmentally friendly, logistically feasible and economically responsible alternative fuel source."
00:02:25.270,00:02:28.398,VERONICA: Leave a message and I'll call you back.
00:02:28.440,00:02:30.233,"Hi, it's Wendy."
00:02:30.275,00:02:33.194,I know you wanted to work with no distractions.
00:02:33.236,00:02:38.241,Just wanted to let you know that Nick Savrinn left six messages for you...
00:02:38.283,00:02:40.410,"Oh, uh, what you said to say."
00:02:40.452,00:02:42.370,That you were in a meeting.
00:02:42.412,00:02:45.206,"Look, if he comes by the office tomorrow, tell him I'm not there, okay?"
00:02:45.248,00:02:46.207,"Okay. Good night, Veronica."
00:02:46.249,00:02:47.417,"Thanks, Wendy."
00:04:42.365,00:04:43.450,C.O.: Bed check!
00:05:24.199,00:05:26.409,Do you want to tell me why you haven't returned any of my phone calls?
00:05:26.451,00:05:29.288,"Look, I really appreciate everything you've done, okay?"
00:05:29.329,00:05:32.207,But I--I don't want your help anymore.
00:05:32.249,00:05:33.333,Don't want my help anymore.
00:05:40.299,00:05:41.591,I don't have time for this right now.
00:05:45.470,00:05:48.307,"Veronica, just wait a second."
00:05:49.057,00:05:50.558,Will you hold on a second?
00:05:50.600,00:05:52.351,"Listen, what are you avoiding..."
00:05:56.106,00:05:58.275,"Lukasz, do you mind walking me back inside?"
00:05:58.317,00:06:02.570,"Take a walk, pal."
00:06:03.446,00:06:05.448,You're being paranoid.
00:06:08.243,00:06:10.369,You're being paranoid.
00:06:24.009,00:06:25.635,"Show some skin, Scofield."
00:06:32.475,00:06:34.853,"Hey, Scofield!"
00:06:47.490,00:06:48.658,"Trying to sleep, boss."
00:06:58.668,00:07:00.503,SCOFIELD: I can't get through the wall.
00:07:00.545,00:07:03.464,"What do you mean, you can't get through the wall?"
00:07:03.506,00:07:05.050,I know how to do it.
00:07:05.092,00:07:06.425,I just don't have the time to do it.
00:07:07.886,00:07:09.428,We're locked up.
00:07:10.680,00:07:12.432,You don't understand.
00:07:13.516,00:07:14.475,I planned this break on a schedule.
00:07:15.602,00:07:19.564,But constantly coming up here for count won't let me do what I need to do to get through that wall.
00:07:19.606,00:07:28.489,"If I'm not back on schedule, which means we're through that wall by the end of the day manana, we're not getting out of here."
00:07:28.531,00:07:30.450,There's three things that are certain in life.
00:07:34.162,00:07:36.456,Only way to stop count is...
00:07:37.540,00:07:38.499,What?
00:07:38.541,00:07:42.170,Never mind.
00:07:42.212,00:07:44.798,Worse than the idea of losing Maricruz?
00:07:49.636,00:07:51.638,A lockdown.
00:07:51.763,00:07:55.142,"We get Gen Pop locked down for a day, you'll have all the time you need."
00:07:55.183,00:07:56.684,And no count?
00:07:58.770,00:08:00.397,Only one problem.
00:08:01.606,00:08:02.565,How do we get a lockdown?
00:08:10.573,00:08:11.325,Can you get to the prison AC unit?
00:08:11.366,00:08:12.409,Maybe.
00:08:14.869,00:08:17.998,"You want a lockdown, you gotta get the inmates riled up."
00:08:19.166,00:08:23.628,"And if you want to piss off the meat in concrete, turn up the heat."
00:09:28.443,00:09:32.030,"Heavy hitters want this done, so that means I want it done."
00:09:32.072,00:09:33.407,No screw-ups.
00:09:33.573,00:09:34.949,"For you, Diamond, it's not a problem."
00:09:35.825,00:09:38.119,TURK: Burrows is as good as dead.
00:09:49.172,00:09:50.840,Hottest April on record.
00:09:51.550,00:09:52.633,Global warming.
00:09:55.429,00:09:57.305,About five years' worth.
00:09:57.347,00:09:59.266,Sorry. Right. Um...
00:10:00.141,00:10:02.310,You never told me Lincoln Burrows is your brother.
00:10:02.352,00:10:05.105,Never came up.
00:10:15.698,00:10:17.242,And he never does.
00:10:18.368,00:10:20.954,My old man was an abusive drunk who abandoned his family.
00:10:22.122,00:10:29.546,"I don't judge anyone by their father's actions or inactions, if that was your concern."
00:10:37.429,00:10:39.680,And I'm sorry about your brother.
00:10:39.722,00:10:43.268,I appreciate that.
00:10:55.113,00:11:01.202,"Um, I have to give Lincoln a weekly check-up now."
00:11:01.244,00:11:05.582,"If you want, I could schedule those visits to end right before you come in for your shots."
00:11:05.624,00:11:11.546,"That way, uh, you'd at least see each other, even if it's just in passing."
00:11:13.006,00:11:15.175,Thank you.
00:11:18.761,00:11:20.138,Yeah.
00:11:35.111,00:11:37.447,"Greetings from the kitchen, Fish. $100."
00:11:46.164,00:11:50.126,"Theodore Bagwell, transfer back from the infirmary."
00:11:50.168,00:11:52.128,C.O.: Check. Open 14.
00:12:03.306,00:12:07.310,We got you a little get-well gift.
00:12:11.690,00:12:13.900,It's just the right size.
00:12:15.151,00:12:17.404,"Thank you, boys."
00:12:18.655,00:12:20.532,I'll catch up with you later.
00:12:25.328,00:12:27.372,What's your name?
00:12:27.914,00:12:28.998,Seth.
00:12:30.333,00:12:31.543,"You new, Seth?"
00:12:33.086,00:12:35.213,Scared?
00:12:41.595,00:12:43.597,You probably heard stories about me.
00:12:47.601,00:12:49.768,They're not all true.
00:12:53.856,00:12:56.025,"What do you say we go for a walk, huh?"
00:14:19.942,00:14:21.110,Your co-counsel's already here.
00:14:21.152,00:14:22.862,Excuse me?
00:14:27.492,00:14:28.909,What the hell are you doing here?
00:14:28.951,00:14:30.119,Talking to my client.
00:14:31.078,00:14:32.413,Don't talk to him.
00:14:32.455,00:14:34.332,VERONICA: We don't know anything about this guy.
00:14:34.374,00:14:36.083,He found somebody that could help us out.
00:14:38.002,00:14:39.379,You have one minute.
00:14:41.214,00:14:42.923,I've been going over the incident report from the night of the murder.
00:14:42.965,00:14:47.261,And somebody made an anonymous phone call to the local cops claiming to see Lincoln running away from the garage with bloody pants.
00:14:47.303,00:14:49.514,"We've been through this, okay."
00:14:49.556,00:14:51.057,You can't cross-examine a witness if you don't know who it is.
00:14:54.977,00:14:56.354,What do you mean?
00:14:56.396,00:15:00.734,"Uh, it took some doing, but a PI friend of mine was able to backtrack the phone call to the police department."
00:15:00.775,00:15:04.445,Whoever made that call couldn't have seen Lincoln running from the garage that night.
00:15:04.487,00:15:05.905,How do you know?
00:15:07.073,00:15:09.116,"Because the phone call came from Washington, D.C."
00:15:30.012,00:15:32.181,"You were supposed to turn off the AC, not turn on the furnace."
00:16:01.168,00:16:03.003,It's getting so hot in here.
00:16:03.045,00:16:04.964,"T-BAG: Did I say you could talk, Cherry?"
00:16:07.341,00:16:09.385,You'll know when I want you to open your mouth.
00:16:14.181,00:16:15.433,Geary!
00:16:15.475,00:16:18.436,You gotta do something about the heat.
00:16:18.478,00:16:20.563,Doing the best we can.
00:16:20.605,00:16:23.232,Your best is garbage.
00:16:23.274,00:16:24.233,Look like I got frostbite to you?
00:16:25.693,00:16:27.528,Line it up!
00:16:46.088,00:16:48.257,Why don't you transfer us all someplace cooler?
00:16:48.883,00:16:50.217,Like Africa.
00:16:53.179,00:16:55.306,"Get your ass on the line, convict."
00:16:59.226,00:17:01.270,"GEARY: All of you, get back in line!"
00:17:01.312,00:17:05.942,We'll move when the temperature situation is rectified.
00:17:10.112,00:17:11.906,"Hey, Bellick, this is Mack in cellblock."
00:17:11.948,00:17:13.240,We got some cons popping off.
00:17:13.282,00:17:16.076,Give them a smack.
00:17:16.118,00:17:18.705,"If you can't handle it, don't cash your paycheck this week."
00:17:20.915,00:17:22.876,"This is not a good time, Doc."
00:17:22.917,00:17:24.502,"Oh, I just got a call."
00:17:24.544,00:17:26.629,He's faking it.
00:17:26.671,00:17:28.339,Is that your medical opinion?
00:17:28.381,00:17:31.425,And we got a bunch of overheated cons getting loud in A-Wing.
00:17:31.467,00:17:33.260,I don't blame them.
00:17:33.302,00:17:34.721,Everything's under control.
00:17:34.762,00:17:37.306,But you should go back to the infirmary building.
00:17:37.348,00:17:40.434,"And when things calm down, I'll have your patients transferred from Sick Bay."
00:17:40.476,00:17:43.437,Just looking out for your best interests.
00:17:43.479,00:17:45.105,And I appreciate that.
00:17:46.148,00:17:51.445,"But, Officer Bellick, you and I both know that it's illegal to deny a prisoner medical care, and you could lose your job over it."
00:17:51.487,00:17:53.781,"Now, I'm just looking out for your best interests."
00:18:00.914,00:18:02.081,"Thank you, sir."
00:18:05.960,00:18:09.463,"Don't be a baby, T-Bag."
00:18:10.464,00:18:12.091,Not that hot?
00:18:13.509,00:18:16.596,"When this guy woke up this morning, he was white."
00:18:25.521,00:18:26.564,You want to cool off?
00:18:28.858,00:18:31.652,MACK: Step back.
00:18:35.448,00:18:39.493,We'll step back when we get some wind blowing in here.
00:18:44.624,00:18:46.166,"All right, that's it!"
00:18:46.208,00:18:49.087,"Everyone, back to your cells!"
00:18:49.128,00:18:51.464,"I said, everyone, back to your cells!"
00:18:51.505,00:18:53.424,"Now, convicts!"
00:18:53.466,00:18:54.634,Lockdown!
00:18:57.428,00:18:59.388,"You got your lockdown, bro."
00:18:59.430,00:19:01.682,You're coming with me.
00:19:01.724,00:19:03.559,"I'm the lookout, man."
00:19:04.226,00:19:05.311,I need you down there.
00:19:05.352,00:19:08.064,It's a two-man job.
00:19:08.106,00:19:09.231,"N-N-No way, man."
00:19:09.273,00:19:12.819,"You only hang a sheet when you and your cellie want to get friendly, you know?"
00:19:12.860,00:19:15.655,You want to protect your prison rep or you want to get out of here?
00:20:19.886,00:20:21.554,What the hell's going on in here?
00:20:21.595,00:20:25.641,"These inmates became belligerent, then they refused to rack in."
00:20:27.393,00:20:31.313,Figured we could handle 20 out-of-control inmates easier than 300.
00:20:35.026,00:20:36.694,"T-BAG: Listen up, bros, listen up."
00:20:36.736,00:20:38.278,"Bellick, I got one for you."
00:20:38.320,00:20:43.617,What do you call a piece of white trash who couldn't pass the cop's exam and now makes less than a mailman?
00:20:43.659,00:20:45.661,A CO.
00:20:47.413,00:20:49.415,Get your hands off the fence.
00:20:49.456,00:20:51.417,"Suck it, pig!"
00:20:58.257,00:21:01.094,"You know, Teddy, you really let me down."
00:20:58.257,00:21:06.224,"And that's hard to do, because I don't expect much from the inbred child of a retard."
00:21:09.518,00:21:11.562,"That's right, Teddy."
00:21:11.604,00:21:21.655,"I read your psych records about how your daddy raped his mongoloid sister and then nine months later, little Teddy pops out."
00:21:38.338,00:21:39.381,Hot as hell.
00:21:40.507,00:21:42.301,They'll wear themselves out eventually.
00:21:46.472,00:21:50.350,The call was a fake.
00:21:50.392,00:21:51.351,N-No.
00:21:51.393,00:21:52.394,What the hell does that mean?
00:21:55.106,00:21:56.356,What the hell does that mean?
00:21:56.398,00:21:59.443,"It means the prosecution could point out the evidence from your criminal trial, okay?"
00:21:59.485,00:22:03.363,"The blood, the video, the gun."
00:22:03.405,00:22:06.951,A questionable phone call is not gonna stack up to that.
00:22:06.993,00:22:08.035,"But it's something, right?"
00:22:08.077,00:22:09.411,Absolutely.
00:22:16.085,00:22:18.378,To the person who made this phone call.
00:22:18.420,00:22:19.379,"Okay, what happens next?"
00:22:19.421,00:22:21.340,We need to catch the next flight to D.C.
00:22:22.424,00:22:24.302,"That is, of course, if you trust me now."
00:22:28.014,00:22:29.347,T-BAG: It's coming!
00:22:30.432,00:22:32.350,It's coming!
00:22:32.392,00:22:34.603,Get on the train!
00:22:47.074,00:22:50.619,Let's get to my office.
00:22:51.495,00:22:53.539,"Oh, just what I thought."
00:22:53.580,00:22:55.582,"The piglets are scared of the big, bad wolf."
00:22:55.624,00:22:58.085,"Big, bad wolf."
00:23:00.004,00:23:01.922,"Oh, just what I thought."
00:23:03.465,00:23:05.551,Get on the train!
00:23:18.480,00:23:19.648,Come on.
00:23:57.435,00:23:59.897,"Marilyn, no."
00:24:21.543,00:24:23.712,Whose keys are those?
00:24:23.754,00:24:26.424,I--I guess in the commotion...
00:24:29.885,00:24:35.515,How many rounds you think you're gonna get off before they get their hands on you?
00:24:35.557,00:24:37.851,This is Bellick.
00:24:38.185,00:24:40.396,Our wing has been breached.
00:24:40.438,00:24:42.440,I want A-Wing evacuated and shut down.
00:24:42.522,00:24:43.607,All access to B-Wing cut off now.
00:24:51.949,00:24:54.618,I'm gonna get some fluids into you.
00:24:54.660,00:24:55.995,"You'll be good as new, okay?"
00:24:56.036,00:24:59.332,Nod your head if you believe me.
00:24:59.373,00:25:00.291,Good man.
00:25:02.584,00:25:04.586,Theo. What can we do for you today?
00:25:07.589,00:25:09.549,Hmm.
00:25:09.591,00:25:10.801,This where it hurts?
00:25:10.843,00:25:12.845,A little higher and to the left.
00:25:12.886,00:25:14.763,You're three weeks post-op.
00:25:14.805,00:25:16.556,Your knee is being held together by a rod and three screws.
00:25:16.598,00:25:18.809,I'm saying tenderness is normal.
00:25:18.851,00:25:20.144,No more meds.
00:25:21.228,00:25:23.689,"SARA: Okay, Kwame, why are you back?"
00:25:23.730,00:25:28.735,C.O.: Inmates in cellblock have compromised lockdown and breached A-Wing through the guard station.
00:25:30.404,00:25:32.406,It's popping off up in G Pop.
00:25:33.449,00:25:34.908,INMATE: All right!
00:25:50.424,00:25:54.761,Somewhere on the other side of this wall is the main drainage pipe to the prison's old sewer system.
00:25:56.847,00:26:00.767,"If we can get through this wall, we can get into the pipe."
00:26:03.354,00:26:04.730,"If we get into the pipe, we can get to the infirmary."
00:26:08.734,00:26:12.654,"And if we can get to the infirmary, then we can get out of here."
00:26:15.657,00:26:17.784,Sorry. All visitors have to leave the facility.
00:26:17.826,00:26:19.828,"No, this..."
00:26:19.870,00:26:21.621,There's a minor disturbance in cellblock.
00:26:21.663,00:26:23.623,A-Wing is being shut down for safety purposes.
00:26:23.665,00:26:25.667,LINCOLN: A-Wing.
00:26:27.378,00:26:28.628,Will he be okay?
00:26:28.670,00:26:31.090,Go to D.C.
00:26:31.131,00:26:32.758,"I'll take care of Michael, all right?"
00:26:32.799,00:26:34.134,Okay.
00:26:37.430,00:26:38.680,Sorry about cutting you short.
00:26:38.722,00:26:40.682,"Bob, how many times have I told you not to apologize?"
00:26:40.724,00:26:42.809,It makes you look weak.
00:26:42.851,00:26:44.520,"Like I said, it's a minor disturbance."
00:26:44.562,00:26:45.645,Minor disturbance.
00:26:45.687,00:26:46.980,Give it to me straight.
00:26:49.567,00:26:52.986,"Some clowns breached cellblock, but they won't get anywhere."
00:26:53.028,00:26:54.654,The hallways have locked doors at either end.
00:26:54.696,00:26:56.782,There's nothing to worry about.
00:26:57.657,00:26:58.616,LINCOLN: Son of a bitch.
00:27:02.413,00:27:05.541,Additional sectors of A-Wing have been compromised.
00:27:21.807,00:27:24.477,I'll be damned.
00:27:25.685,00:27:27.729,A rookie CO and it ain't even Christmas.
00:27:30.732,00:27:31.691,Take the cuffs off.
00:27:35.195,00:27:36.489,Give me the keys.
00:27:36.530,00:27:37.697,"Get out of here, T-Bag."
00:27:37.739,00:27:40.700,"Oh, I see."
00:27:40.742,00:27:43.703,"Ah, you know, I respect that. I do."
00:27:43.745,00:27:47.040,"But, uh, I think we can work something out."
00:27:48.041,00:27:49.709,What you got?
00:27:49.751,00:27:53.713,"Oh, I can make your last few weeks on earth quite, quite enjoyable."
00:27:53.755,00:27:55.174,"Get you some Demerol, some X."
00:27:56.342,00:27:58.718,"You know, make you forget about that big, bad chair."
00:27:58.760,00:28:00.804,No deal.
00:28:01.888,00:28:04.141,You gotta learn the art of negotiating.
00:28:05.142,00:28:08.020,Lesson one: Bargaining position.
00:28:10.147,00:28:10.730,Rules just changed.
00:28:10.772,00:28:12.732,Get the pig!
00:28:12.774,00:28:14.276,TROKEY: Come on!
00:28:17.363,00:28:19.781,What are you doing?
00:28:19.823,00:28:23.536,Look around!
00:28:23.577,00:28:24.662,Then walk away.
00:28:24.702,00:28:26.913,We both know that ain't gonna happen.
00:28:26.955,00:28:27.831,Yeah?
00:28:46.433,00:28:47.767,That's one big pile of concrete.
00:28:47.809,00:28:50.312,How do you know where the pipe is?
00:28:52.856,00:28:54.774,We've got someone to show us where it is.
00:28:54.816,00:28:56.902,"Oh, really? Who?"
00:29:08.788,00:29:10.249,The infection's not so bad.
00:29:10.290,00:29:12.585,"I'm gonna give you a shot of penicillin just to make sure, okay?"
00:29:12.626,00:29:13.752,"Thanks, Doc."
00:29:22.844,00:29:24.804,This is Rizzo.
00:29:24.846,00:29:26.806,Does A-Wing need backup? Over.
00:29:26.848,00:29:28.767,A-Wing is evacuating and locked down.
00:29:28.808,00:29:29.809,Remain in B-Wing.
00:29:43.741,00:29:44.783,"What's up, Doc?"
00:30:05.095,00:30:08.890,Come on.
00:30:08.932,00:30:11.602,You don't want to do this.
00:30:12.728,00:30:13.853,INMATE: Here we go!
00:30:27.826,00:30:31.705,"We're sorry, this line is experiencing technical difficulties."
00:30:37.919,00:30:44.843,You ever see one of them safari shows where a bunch of cheetahs just jump all up on an antelope?
00:30:44.926,00:30:46.470,T-BAG: Guess which one you are.
00:31:12.579,00:31:14.331,"Tough little gorilla, ain't he?"
00:31:22.964,00:31:25.342,I was raised to believe the devil's got some crazy power.
00:31:25.384,00:31:27.927,But I don't think shining him on this wall is gonna bring it down.
00:31:27.969,00:31:29.929,Not unless he's got a sledgehammer with him.
00:31:29.971,00:31:32.891,We don't need a sledgehammer.
00:31:38.980,00:31:40.940,What the hell am I supposed to do with this?
00:31:45.529,00:31:48.073,"Sick Bay, report."
00:31:48.114,00:31:49.157,STROKER: Come on!
00:31:50.367,00:31:51.993,"Sick Bay, come in."
00:31:53.995,00:31:55.914,You know what to say.
00:32:00.377,00:32:03.255,All clear in Sick Bay. Over.
00:32:03.296,00:32:04.882,Roger that.
00:32:12.013,00:32:16.976,You worry about how you're gonna drill through a six-inch concrete wall with what used to be an eggbeater.
00:32:17.018,00:32:18.353,We just need a few small holes.
00:32:18.395,00:32:20.856,How are we gonna fit through a few small holes?
00:32:20.898,00:32:22.482,You ever hear of tensile strength?
00:32:22.524,00:32:23.983,Hooke's law of elasticity?
00:32:25.026,00:32:26.278,What do you think?
00:32:26.319,00:32:30.323,"If we drill holes in strategic locations, we compromise the load-carrying capacity of the wall."
00:32:30.365,00:32:33.034,How about speaking English?
00:32:33.076,00:32:35.203,We'll be able to break through the part of the wall that covers the pipe opening.
00:32:35.245,00:32:36.371,Give me that.
00:32:38.331,00:32:45.547,"We go in through the tip of each horn, the eyes, the end of the nose, the bottom of the fangs, end of the braids."
00:32:45.589,00:32:46.965,It makes a kind of X.
00:32:47.591,00:32:49.760,Let's get to it.
00:33:00.312,00:33:03.189,If I can get DIRT in there with some of the newer firepower the State's issued.
00:33:03.231,00:33:06.025,So we can end the riot today and start the funerals tomorrow?
00:33:06.067,00:33:08.027,"I can contain this, sir."
00:33:08.069,00:33:09.279,"Warden, I got a call."
00:33:09.321,00:33:12.532,"I think you should take this, boss."
00:33:12.574,00:33:13.533,Governor.
00:33:13.575,00:33:15.911,GOVERNOR: Where's my daughter?
00:33:15.953,00:33:17.329,"Not to worry, sir."
00:33:17.370,00:33:18.997,"She's in Sick Bay, in B-Wing."
00:33:20.290,00:33:21.625,It's a completely different part of the facility.
00:33:21.667,00:33:23.460,It's totally locked off from the disturbance.
00:33:23.502,00:33:26.045,Disturbance?
00:33:26.087,00:33:27.923,Can any of these animals get to her?
00:33:29.591,00:33:32.051,"Sir, it's impossible for anyone from A-Wing to get into Sick Bay."
00:33:32.093,00:33:34.053,A guard there assures us that everything is fine.
00:33:34.095,00:33:36.097,"We have everything under control, Governor."
00:33:36.139,00:33:38.558,"For your sake, you better hope you do."
00:33:51.112,00:33:52.531,"I'm gonna dance with you, Doc!"
00:33:54.115,00:33:55.993,I'm gonna dance till the sun come up!
00:33:56.702,00:33:58.077,"Come on, Doc, come on!"
00:33:58.119,00:34:00.079,STROKER: Open the door!
00:34:00.121,00:34:01.206,Open the door!
00:34:06.127,00:34:07.462,"All right, it's your turn."
00:34:07.504,00:34:09.088,"No. Uh, I ain't messing with no diablo, man."
00:34:09.130,00:34:10.298,We can't afford downtime.
00:34:10.340,00:34:12.634,We have to switch off with the drilling.
00:34:12.676,00:34:14.052,"It's bad mojo, bro."
00:34:14.093,00:34:19.307,"I mess with him, you drill into him, I got enough enemies already, papi."
00:34:19.349,00:34:20.350,Esta bien?
00:34:21.351,00:34:22.435,"You believe in God, right?"
00:34:22.477,00:34:23.937,You know I do.
00:34:23.979,00:34:26.356,So you're protected.
00:34:27.190,00:34:29.317,He'll protect you from him.
00:35:00.139,00:35:01.307,Gentlemen!
00:35:02.434,00:35:12.736,"I assure you once Bob and I are done getting acquainted, everyone else will get their turn."
00:35:23.538,00:35:26.041,"T-BAG: We're gonna have a little fun now, Bobby."
00:35:27.084,00:35:28.710,Don't worry.
00:35:28.752,00:35:31.588,My pipes are clean.
00:35:34.424,00:35:36.509,"Now, where you going, rookie?"
00:35:38.762,00:35:41.347,"No, no, no, no."
00:35:42.057,00:35:44.017,"No, no, no, no."
00:35:44.059,00:35:48.146,They always think they can run away.
00:36:04.412,00:36:06.414,"SUCRE: Got a question for you, Fish."
00:36:08.249,00:36:12.504,"What if we do all this work, and the pipe is 10 feet that way?"
00:36:12.545,00:36:13.588,It won't be.
00:36:13.630,00:36:15.590,You got X-ray vision?
00:36:15.632,00:36:20.428,"I calculated the drill point coordinates, hid them in my tattoo and then projected them back onto the wall."
00:36:20.470,00:36:22.889,Everything's been worked out so the image hits the right spot.
00:36:22.931,00:36:24.850,It's just math.
00:36:24.891,00:36:26.476,What if your math is wrong?
00:36:28.227,00:36:30.563,You'll drill into one of a dozen gas lines behind the wall.
00:36:30.605,00:36:32.231,There'll be an explosion and we'll be burned alive.
00:36:38.279,00:36:39.531,"But you're good at math, right?"
00:37:12.313,00:37:13.606,They're breaking out.
00:37:24.034,00:37:26.119,They're breaking...
00:37:47.599,00:37:50.518,INMATE 1: Come on!
00:37:51.937,00:37:52.645,Open it up!
00:37:52.687,00:37:54.773,Come on!
00:37:54.814,00:37:56.399,"Yo, Stroke."
00:37:56.441,00:37:57.650,"You got longer arms than me, man."
00:37:57.692,00:37:59.485,INMATE 2: You better get out of there.
00:38:03.656,00:38:05.575,Son of a...
00:38:10.413,00:38:12.124,That bitch stuck me.
00:38:28.848,00:38:30.349,They think it's hot now?
00:38:30.391,00:38:33.061,I want all the water shut off.
00:38:33.103,00:38:34.479,"Mack, you take care of it."
00:38:35.480,00:38:36.689,"MACK: Yes, sir."
00:38:48.409,00:38:49.953,"Yeah, we--we have a problem."
00:38:49.995,00:38:51.579,"Oh, that's right."
00:38:51.621,00:38:53.039,"Yeah, Bob here has seen the hole."
00:39:00.421,00:39:02.174,He's seen the hole.
00:39:02.215,00:39:05.384,So have you.
00:39:05.426,00:39:08.513,"Looks like your lockdown idea didn't work out too good, huh?"
00:39:13.101,00:39:14.352,We gotta kill him.
00:39:15.394,00:39:16.437,The cops are right outside.
00:39:18.815,00:39:22.819,And they'll stay outside as long as they know we're keeping him alive.
00:39:22.861,00:39:25.404,But he's a guard.
00:39:25.446,00:39:29.075,"What the hell does this have to do with you, anyway?"
00:39:29.117,00:39:31.870,This is not any of your concern.
00:39:31.911,00:39:33.038,Hmm.
00:39:37.250,00:39:41.420,"See, Bob here knows about our secret."
00:39:41.462,00:39:44.049,He knows about our escape.
00:39:46.467,00:39:49.387,"So it's all of our concern now, isn't it?"
00:40:07.197,00:40:09.157,"Easy, big fellow."
00:40:09.199,00:40:11.910,Looks like you took a pretty good hit.
00:40:15.372,00:40:18.041,Cons got that rook guard in Gen Pop.
00:40:19.417,00:40:20.043,"Kid's probably dead already, or wishing he was."
00:40:20.085,00:40:22.045,Where's Scofield?
00:40:22.087,00:40:23.421,Haven't seen him since things jumped off.
00:40:23.462,00:40:25.131,I gotta find him.
00:40:27.508,00:40:28.051,"Yeah, Turk."
00:40:39.520,00:40:41.731,"Now, you listen, pervert."
00:40:41.773,00:40:44.483,You're in as much trouble as he is.
00:40:44.525,00:40:46.903,Go ahead-- Go ahead.
00:40:48.196,00:40:51.741,"Let's see how many times I can shout out about your little hole in there before I bleed out, huh?"
00:40:51.783,00:40:56.579,'Cause every con in here is gonna know about your little escape before one drip of my blood hits the floor.
00:40:58.373,00:41:03.044,"So, you see, friends, either I'm through that hole with you or I'm gonna sing like Johnny Cash."
00:41:22.147,00:41:24.816,STROKER: Open the door!
00:41:30.863,00:41:32.531,"Hey, yo, check it."
00:41:32.573,00:41:33.992,Stroker's about to get the Doc.
00:41:49.841,00:41:52.010,"Sucre, I need you to finish what we started."
00:41:52.051,00:41:54.429,"What's going on, man?"
00:41:54.471,00:41:56.681,"Hey, there's no way into B-Wing."
00:41:56.722,00:41:58.266,I'm not.
00:42:00.143,00:42:02.020,No one.
00:42:09.402,00:42:11.946,"You gonna clue me in, pie-zon?"
00:42:16.409,00:42:18.661,It's faster if we cut through here.
00:42:21.622,00:42:23.416,TURK: Burrows is as good as dead.
00:43:16.010,00:43:19.597,"INMATE: Open up, you bitch, open it up!"
00:00:01.752,00:00:04.755,"MALE NARRATOR: Previously on Prison Break: I didn't kill that man, Michael."
00:00:06.089,00:00:08.008,I was set up.
00:00:08.968,00:00:11.052,POLICEMAN: Put down your weapon.
00:00:11.094,00:00:13.054,I find it incumbent that you see the inside of a prison cell.
00:00:13.096,00:00:15.516,I'm looking for someone.
00:00:15.557,00:00:16.725,SUCRE: Man killed the Vice President's brother.
00:00:16.767,00:00:19.060,Why you want to see Burrows so bad anyhow?
00:00:19.102,00:00:19.895,SCOFIELD: Because he's my brother.
00:00:19.937,00:00:21.939,I'm getting you out of here.
00:00:21.981,00:00:24.065,It's impossible.
00:00:27.110,00:00:28.236,I've got them on me.
00:00:30.113,00:00:32.240,"Hey, if you're talking about that guy at Fox River..."
00:00:32.282,00:00:34.869,He refuses to call him his father.
00:00:37.120,00:00:39.039,The chair isn't the only way to take a man's life in prison.
00:00:41.124,00:00:43.084,FEMALE NARRATOR: And now scenes from last week's episode.
00:00:43.126,00:00:46.964,But constantly coming up here for count won't let me do what I need to do to get through that wall.
00:00:47.006,00:00:49.257,SUCRE: Only way to stop count is a lockdown.
00:00:49.299,00:00:51.760,You gotta get the inmates riled up.
00:00:52.720,00:00:54.513,"All right, that's it!"
00:00:57.892,00:00:59.059,How do you know?
00:00:59.100,00:01:01.102,"Because the phone call came from Washington, D.C."
00:01:03.981,00:01:05.482,This is Bellick.
00:01:06.692,00:01:08.109,Hooke's law of elasticity?
00:01:08.151,00:01:13.114,"If we drill holes in strategic locations, we compromise the load-carrying capacity of the wall."
00:01:13.156,00:01:14.115,Take the cuffs off.
00:01:14.157,00:01:16.117,A rookie CO.
00:01:16.159,00:01:17.411,"LINCOLN: Get out of here, T-Bag."
00:01:17.452,00:01:19.120,I think we can work something out.
00:01:19.162,00:01:20.664,No deal.
00:01:22.165,00:01:24.125,TANCREDI: Where's my daughter?
00:01:24.167,00:01:26.253,"POPE: Not to worry, sir."
00:01:26.294,00:01:28.129,A guard there assures us that everything is fine.
00:01:28.171,00:01:30.131,"We have everything under control, Governor."
00:01:30.173,00:01:31.466,You better hope you do.
00:01:35.554,00:01:37.138,They're breaking out.
00:01:38.473,00:01:39.474,They're breaking...
00:01:42.728,00:01:44.145,We need a favor.
00:01:44.187,00:01:46.147,Some heavy hitters want this done.
00:01:46.189,00:01:47.190,TURK: Burrows is as good as dead.
00:01:48.984,00:01:50.485,"Yeah, Turk."
00:01:51.695,00:01:54.364,"Hey, yo, Stroker's about to get the Doc."
00:01:58.201,00:02:01.371,"Sucre, I need you to finish what we started."
00:02:01.413,00:02:04.124,No one touches the CO.
00:02:32.235,00:02:34.237,Attention all personnel.
00:02:34.279,00:02:37.116,Secure the perimeter.
00:02:38.450,00:02:40.201,...on all areas.
00:02:40.243,00:02:44.957,Attention. The area is on secure lockdown.
00:03:18.323,00:03:20.617,Any word from the Governor?
00:03:23.244,00:03:25.204,"Bellick, get those guys in line."
00:03:26.040,00:03:27.833,Get them into formation.
00:03:27.875,00:03:29.877,We going back in?
00:03:29.918,00:03:32.253,We cut the water off about an hour ago.
00:03:32.295,00:03:34.213,The stink alone should drive them out of there.
00:03:34.255,00:03:36.466,You think that's gonna work?
00:03:37.718,00:03:40.220,And we're all gonna do this by the book.
00:03:40.261,00:03:44.224,It's the best chance we have of everybody getting out of there without getting hurt.
00:03:47.394,00:03:51.272,This is the Warden.
00:03:51.314,00:03:52.440,We got some demands!
00:03:56.319,00:03:58.238,We need the AC.
00:03:59.073,00:04:01.158,We got a hostage. A guard.
00:04:02.159,00:04:04.828,"We got a hostage, the new guard."
00:04:07.164,00:04:09.249,Find out who's in there.
00:04:22.387,00:04:25.306,Why don't you do it?
00:04:30.353,00:04:31.396,And we got the girl doctor!
00:04:33.148,00:04:35.150,The doctor?
00:04:36.860,00:04:39.320,How the hell did that happen?
00:04:39.362,00:04:41.322,I thought she was safe.
00:04:41.364,00:04:43.283,We got to get her out of there. Somebody has got to go in there now.
00:04:43.324,00:04:45.619,"We can't do it, sir."
00:04:47.370,00:04:49.081,It's not by the book.
00:05:00.383,00:05:02.719,"Sir, I've got some updates for you."
00:05:08.391,00:05:12.479,Help! Help!
00:05:25.826,00:05:28.078,LINCOLN: Scofield's in here?
00:05:29.997,00:05:31.873,You sure he's in here?
00:07:17.520,00:07:19.439,You ain't gonna use that.
00:07:20.523,00:07:22.567,You making up the rules now?
00:07:22.609,00:07:25.486,It's my house.
00:07:25.528,00:07:28.115,"Yeah, I got a problem."
00:07:28.156,00:07:31.451,I'm not a problem.
00:07:32.535,00:07:33.578,I'm not gonna say anything.
00:07:35.414,00:07:37.540,I didn't see anything.
00:07:37.582,00:07:40.460,You didn't see nothing.
00:07:41.878,00:07:43.588,Wait. Don't leave.
00:07:47.759,00:07:51.430,Sorry. I'll be back.
00:07:53.390,00:07:55.809,Don't worry.
00:08:03.275,00:08:07.487,"Don't worry, CO, all right?"
00:08:08.571,00:08:10.490,I'm part of the team now.
00:08:14.577,00:08:18.999,Help a brother out.
00:08:23.878,00:08:24.545,That's the way.
00:08:24.587,00:08:27.424,"Mmm, mmm, mmm, hmm."
00:09:06.629,00:09:10.591,"Ladies and gentlemen, please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts."
00:09:10.633,00:09:13.720,"We're making our final approach into Washington, D.C."
00:09:18.766,00:09:20.894,Who wanted Terrence Steadman dead?
00:09:20.935,00:09:23.897,The call came from D.C.
00:09:23.938,00:09:26.607,You got to think past the government.
00:09:26.649,00:09:28.943,Anybody could be here.
00:09:30.653,00:09:36.617,"Before Steadman was killed, Ecofield introduced a prototype electric engine at the techno conference."
00:09:36.659,00:09:41.164,$60 barrels of oil would be obsolete if that thing ever hit the mainstream.
00:09:41.998,00:09:44.167,"Could be oil, oil companies."
00:09:44.209,00:09:47.337,"Suppliers, consumers, everything in between."
00:09:48.629,00:09:51.258,Or the government of an oil-based economy.
00:09:52.675,00:09:54.594,Like the United States.
00:09:55.636,00:09:57.013,Can I take your soda?
00:09:57.055,00:09:58.598,Thank you.
00:10:00.683,00:10:03.061,"At any rate, we land, we meet my guy."
00:10:04.687,00:10:07.732,"And even if we don't find the person who tipped off the cops, we find his phone."
00:10:07.774,00:10:09.025,The paper trail begins.
00:10:20.036,00:10:23.706,"STROKER: Only a matter of time, Doc."
00:10:27.919,00:10:30.255,Help!
00:11:52.920,00:11:53.963,That's the Governor.
00:11:55.089,00:11:56.799,"Whatever happens, don't say anything."
00:12:22.033,00:12:24.785,"Governor, appreciate your coming."
00:12:22.033,00:12:27.788,"Now, you should know, since our conversation, the situation has escalated."
00:12:27.830,00:12:30.458,But not to worry.
00:12:30.500,00:12:33.794,"Just cut the crap, Warden, and tell me where my daughter is."
00:12:38.841,00:12:39.967,Help!
00:12:43.846,00:12:45.890,Help!
00:12:47.392,00:12:50.353,T-BAG: What have we got here?
00:12:51.854,00:12:55.774,"Oh, look at that address, 144 Oak Park..."
00:12:56.859,00:12:57.818,What's this?
00:12:57.860,00:13:00.447,Terrace.
00:13:00.488,00:13:03.074,Terrace.
00:13:03.116,00:13:06.953,"Sounds like you're about something, living on a terrace."
00:13:08.204,00:13:12.083,I can't wait to kick it on a terrace. What?
00:13:13.209,00:13:14.753,"Oh, oh."
00:13:15.920,00:13:18.715,This here must be your daughter.
00:13:18.757,00:13:19.798,Prom?
00:13:24.137,00:13:27.806,"You know what they say about a prom dress, don't you?"
00:13:31.645,00:13:33.980,"She ain't come home that night, did she?"
00:13:35.774,00:13:39.110,"No, she wore that all night long."
00:13:40.903,00:13:50.871,"Next morning, she had to throw that dress in the trash can behind the motel so her mama didn't see the..."
00:13:50.913,00:13:53.333,What the hell are you doing?
00:13:53.374,00:13:56.961,I'm just kicking it with Deputy Dawg.
00:13:58.921,00:14:04.843,"I'll be very clear here, because you and I face an evolutionary gap."
00:14:06.929,00:14:10.099,You ain't gonna hurt this man.
00:14:10.141,00:14:12.851,We're locked into this thing now.
00:14:16.147,00:14:18.857,And he's the only leverage we have.
00:14:24.071,00:14:26.073,Thank you.
00:14:28.201,00:14:30.870,"Now, do we have an understanding?"
00:14:32.831,00:14:36.876,I'm on your side now.
00:14:38.336,00:14:41.214,"You let me know when you're done with your, uh, leverage."
00:14:59.982,00:15:02.318,Let me out!
00:15:07.990,00:15:09.909,Let's smoke the bitch out!
00:15:23.923,00:15:25.966,SARA: Help!
00:15:36.394,00:15:38.897,"What are you gonna do now, Doc?"
00:15:50.283,00:15:53.745,It ain't gonna hurt real bad if you make it easy.
00:15:53.787,00:15:55.955,"If you make it hard, though..."
00:15:59.250,00:16:01.085,Open the door! Come here!
00:16:02.295,00:16:04.923,"I said, open the door!"
00:16:08.050,00:16:08.968,Come on!
00:16:16.016,00:16:19.270,STROKER: Come here.
00:16:24.066,00:16:25.025,I've got you.
00:16:34.076,00:16:37.914,You all right? It's okay.
00:16:40.667,00:16:43.377,See these pipes?
00:16:44.712,00:16:48.048,"They go through the wall and over the hallway, and they're gonna get us out of here."
00:16:48.090,00:16:51.093,All you have to do is follow me.
00:16:51.135,00:16:53.513,Okay?
00:16:54.096,00:16:56.015,Okay. Let's go.
00:17:07.109,00:17:08.987,Where'd she go?
00:17:25.127,00:17:26.170,VERONICA: Where are we meeting him?
00:17:26.212,00:17:28.172,"NICK: Georgetown, in a parking garage."
00:17:28.214,00:17:30.049,He's a private investigator.
00:17:30.090,00:17:32.552,"He used to be my roommate, freshman year at Duke."
00:17:34.888,00:17:36.639,MALE REPORTER: The disturbance has escalated...
00:17:36.681,00:17:38.098,"Oh, my God, Nick, look."
00:17:38.140,00:17:46.106,At least two hostages have been confirmed in what is now being called a full-scale riot here at the Fox River State Penitentiary.
00:17:46.148,00:17:48.693,"Should we go back, or keep going?"
00:17:48.735,00:17:50.236,We should keep going.
00:17:57.159,00:17:58.494,Come on.
00:17:59.704,00:18:04.166,MALE REPORTER: The National Guard responded after Illinois Governor Frank Tancredi declared a state of emergency...
00:18:04.208,00:18:06.126,"Come on, honey, it's time to go."
00:18:06.168,00:18:09.129,"...no word on what caused the initial disturbance, but sources..."
00:18:09.171,00:18:11.716,"That's not Fox River, is it?"
00:18:11.758,00:18:14.134,...Corrections say tensions often run high at this facility.
00:18:14.176,00:18:18.138,Fox River is a level-five institution housing some of the most dangerous criminals...
00:18:18.180,00:18:20.140,What are you doing?
00:18:20.182,00:18:22.643,No. Dad might be in trouble.
00:18:22.685,00:18:25.855,Your father's already in trouble. There's nothing we can do about it.
00:18:27.189,00:18:28.107,"Just don't make a scene, okay?"
00:18:30.109,00:18:32.152,He gets very uncomfortable with this thing. Just...
00:18:32.194,00:18:36.490,"Let's just go, okay? Please."
00:18:38.076,00:18:41.161,"We're just talking about my old man here, and his life."
00:18:41.203,00:18:44.164,If--if that's all right with you.
00:18:44.206,00:18:45.666,I am leaving you out of it.
00:18:45.708,00:18:48.168,I left you out of it the day I met you.
00:18:48.210,00:18:51.171,Because nothing in her life or mine has anything to do with you.
00:18:51.213,00:18:53.173,I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.
00:18:53.215,00:18:55.175,ADRIAN: You see? This is what I'm talking about.
00:18:55.217,00:18:56.636,This is the kind of crap I have to deal with.
00:18:56.677,00:18:58.178,Just let me handle it!
00:18:58.220,00:19:00.848,"LJ, you want to talk to me, you talk..."
00:19:00.890,00:19:03.142,"Oh, you got no clue, do you?"
00:19:03.851,00:19:04.978,Honey...
00:19:05.019,00:19:06.980,Get off me!
00:19:07.021,00:19:09.273,You don't talk to your mother like that.
00:19:09.315,00:19:11.109,"Take that, boy."
00:19:13.235,00:19:16.196,"Go upstairs, LJ, now!"
00:19:16.238,00:19:17.156,Go!

00:19:19.325,00:19:22.161,You love that man?
00:19:47.269,00:19:48.604,Turk.
00:19:48.646,00:19:51.190,Why are you doing this?
00:19:51.524,00:19:52.150,Why? Why?
00:20:29.311,00:20:33.232,Why'd you do this?
00:20:34.316,00:20:38.029,"Man, you got to help me."
00:20:40.322,00:20:41.407,Talk!
00:21:15.357,00:21:19.028,Who's your friend?
00:21:20.238,00:21:23.282,Who you talking to?
00:21:24.867,00:21:26.452,The devil marks the wall so you know where to drill the holes.
00:21:26.493,00:21:28.955,You're making holes with an eggbeater?
00:21:28.996,00:21:30.372,"I know. Crazy, huh?"
00:21:31.373,00:21:33.000,It's called the Hooker law.
00:21:38.380,00:21:40.883,That's true.
00:21:45.512,00:21:47.974,"At least, that's the plan."
00:21:48.015,00:21:49.308,"Yeah, that's always the plan."
00:21:52.394,00:21:55.397,You should never underestimate a wall.
00:22:16.127,00:22:18.587,Are you all right?
00:22:22.424,00:22:25.052,Come look this way!
00:22:29.431,00:22:31.349,Open up!
00:22:33.435,00:22:36.354,You know what?
00:22:36.396,00:22:39.650,It's not much further.
00:22:41.235,00:22:43.403,"You know, we can stop if you want."
00:22:43.445,00:22:46.282,"Okay. Yeah, I could use a minute."
00:22:47.867,00:22:50.036,"Come here, girl."
00:22:50.077,00:22:52.454,Things should be winding down around now.
00:22:53.873,00:22:56.416,Pretty soon the powers that be will break in and it'll all be over.
00:22:56.458,00:22:59.419,It's just a matter of time.
00:22:59.461,00:23:01.547,What's happening in A-Wing?
00:23:04.424,00:23:06.384,All hell's breaking loose.
00:23:07.970,00:23:10.890,"But I think if we stay up here, we should be okay."
00:23:12.432,00:23:15.019,I can't believe this is happening.
00:23:15.061,00:23:18.356,"Yeah, come here."
00:23:18.396,00:23:20.566,"You know, I'm fishing, girl."
00:23:21.483,00:23:22.860,"I know you want it, girl."
00:23:28.490,00:23:30.326,You ever been to Baja?
00:23:31.160,00:23:34.121,Mexico?
00:23:34.163,00:23:36.414,There's this great place down there.
00:23:36.999,00:23:41.087,"$20 a night, hammock on the back deck."
00:23:42.255,00:23:43.589,Beers are 50 cents.
00:23:44.840,00:23:46.592,25 cents at happy hour.
00:23:49.387,00:23:53.015,Ever been to Thailand?
00:23:53.057,00:23:56.434,"Michael, if you're trying to calm me down, you're doing a terrible job."
00:23:57.435,00:23:59.397,But I am trying.
00:24:00.189,00:24:01.065,Shh.
00:24:02.024,00:24:03.276,You hear that?
00:24:04.526,00:24:06.570,Why are you here?
00:24:08.864,00:24:12.492,"Crawling around in the ceiling, risking your life."
00:24:12.534,00:24:16.454,"You needed help and, uh, I came to find you."
00:24:22.502,00:24:24.630,How did you know where to go?
00:24:28.466,00:24:32.930,"When everything went off in A-Wing, the COs left the station and I saw you on the monitor."
00:24:32.972,00:24:37.310,"One of my first assignments on PI, we were up here cleaning out toxic mold."
00:24:37.351,00:24:40.478,"It took days, so I'm kind of familiar with the layout."
00:24:42.522,00:24:44.024,Hope you wore a mask.
00:24:45.025,00:24:46.484,Excuse me?
00:24:47.778,00:24:49.738,Mold can be really dangerous.
00:24:50.572,00:24:51.489,"Yeah, I wore a mask."
00:25:00.166,00:25:02.084,"Get up there, get up there."
00:25:05.587,00:25:09.383,"The door to the Visitation Room, do you ever use it?"
00:25:09.425,00:25:12.552,"Um, not usually."
00:25:12.594,00:25:14.512,STROKER: Get up.
00:25:17.599,00:25:19.559,Come on.
00:25:20.811,00:25:22.520,Let's go. Move.
00:25:24.398,00:25:25.732,"Come on, baby."
00:25:34.616,00:25:36.369,"STROKER: Get up there, man."
00:25:41.415,00:25:42.582,Let's go!
00:25:45.627,00:25:46.544,Come here!
00:25:51.758,00:25:54.552,"Yes, sir, I understand."
00:25:54.594,00:25:56.930,The hell she is.
00:25:56.972,00:25:59.599,I ordered a state of emergency an hour ago.
00:25:59.641,00:26:01.435,Soldier.
00:26:01.477,00:26:03.145,Get me your commanding officer.
00:26:03.187,00:26:04.897,"Now, what the hell is going on out here?"
00:26:04.938,00:26:07.607,"Negotiating, sir."
00:26:07.649,00:26:09.026,Negotiating?
00:26:09.068,00:26:10.986,It is 100 degrees in there.
00:26:11.028,00:26:12.905,We are trying to avoid doing anything extreme.
00:26:12.946,00:26:16.616,"Look, I don't care if it takes a massacre to get her out of there."
00:26:16.658,00:26:20.120,Do you understand me?
00:26:20.162,00:26:21.539,Sir.
00:26:21.579,00:26:24.166,"Spread the news, you're going in."
00:26:24.958,00:26:26.919,It's time to do this my way.
00:26:43.601,00:26:44.770,All right.
00:27:04.039,00:27:05.623,I got you.
00:27:15.633,00:27:16.927,"Hey, Fish!"
00:27:18.137,00:27:19.721,You gonna keep that nurse all to yourself?
00:27:42.744,00:27:43.912,Stop!
00:27:52.754,00:27:55.007,"Oh, my knee!"
00:27:56.758,00:27:58.093,SARA: Come on. This way.
00:28:17.779,00:28:20.740,"Good call, Governor, bringing in the big guns."
00:28:20.782,00:28:24.119,Appreciate your support.
00:28:29.749,00:28:32.710,Oh. And what are they?
00:28:32.794,00:28:35.713,"These inmates don't mess around, us CO's need to get tough."
00:28:37.591,00:28:39.718,"Warden Pope's a good guy, don't get me wrong."
00:28:39.759,00:28:44.764,But he doesn't understand that sometimes you got to grab the situation by the gonads and take control.
00:28:44.806,00:28:46.099,"And is that what you would do, Captain?"
00:28:47.809,00:28:48.727,So...
00:28:57.986,00:28:59.738,"Give me that, give me that."
00:29:00.822,00:29:02.782,"I don't know, I..."
00:29:04.826,00:29:07.787,The whole trick is pressure.
00:29:07.829,00:29:10.790,Where should I... Here?
00:29:10.832,00:29:12.042,"Good, good."
00:29:12.084,00:29:15.337,"You see, you should push hard but not too hard."
00:29:15.379,00:29:17.047,"Just like when you're, you know."
00:29:17.089,00:29:18.798,"Yeah, but you got to be careful, though."
00:29:18.840,00:29:20.800,"Yeah, yeah."
00:29:20.842,00:29:22.802,"One slip, and you'll hit the gas pipe."
00:29:22.844,00:29:24.722,Gas pipe?
00:29:24.763,00:29:26.973,"Yeah, you know."
00:29:39.861,00:29:41.739,We can't go this way.
00:29:41.780,00:29:44.116,We have to.
00:29:44.157,00:29:46.118,This is it.
00:29:47.953,00:29:50.163,It's back this way.
00:29:50.205,00:29:51.831,Trust me.
00:29:51.873,00:29:53.584,We don't have time.
00:30:01.091,00:30:04.803,"Not too hard, not too soft..."
00:30:05.971,00:30:08.432,"When I was her age, I had such bad skin."
00:30:11.810,00:30:13.312,"Acne, they called it."
00:30:14.896,00:30:19.568,"Yeah, she looks just like all them girls who made fun of me."
00:30:21.528,00:30:30.537,"After I kill you, I'm gonna crawl out that hole and call me up a limousine, and me and your baby's going to the prom."
00:30:52.559,00:30:54.853,"Captain, what's the news with Sara?"
00:30:54.894,00:30:55.895,"Still trying to find her, sir."
00:30:55.937,00:30:57.523,You don't even know where she is?
00:30:57.564,00:31:00.859,We're on it.
00:31:02.695,00:31:04.904,I should've listened to Captain Bellick and gassed the whole block.
00:31:06.906,00:31:09.326,He's right on the frontline.
00:31:09.368,00:31:12.496,You better pray that Sara gets out of there in one piece.
00:31:12.538,00:31:15.332,"I do, Governor, but this is still my prison."
00:31:15.374,00:31:18.794,"Whatever happens, I take full responsibility."
00:31:19.169,00:31:20.796,Excuse me.
00:31:31.931,00:31:34.309,It's this way.
00:31:37.396,00:31:38.689,Ooh.
00:31:39.272,00:31:41.274,Yes. We're through.
00:31:42.942,00:31:46.530,Time to put this theory to the test.
00:31:47.531,00:31:48.907,I guess we start chipping away now.
00:31:49.908,00:31:52.786,Right on.
00:32:21.022,00:32:23.233,This is about right.
00:32:24.025,00:32:25.944,We did it.
00:32:29.489,00:32:30.699,That's it.
00:32:31.533,00:32:33.993,"Wait, I can't leave you here."
00:32:34.035,00:32:36.996,You don't have a choice.
00:32:37.038,00:32:38.957,INMATE: Over there!
00:32:38.998,00:32:41.000,"INMATE 1: Come on, man."
00:32:41.042,00:32:42.753,INMATE 2: Check this out.
00:32:47.006,00:32:49.676,Can you see the assailant?
00:32:49.718,00:32:52.888,Number eight. Affirmative.
00:32:54.556,00:32:56.308,What are you gonna do?
00:32:57.517,00:33:00.019,Go back to my cell.
00:33:00.061,00:33:00.896,Michael.
00:33:08.904,00:33:11.990,You have to go.
00:33:27.422,00:33:30.049,You go out the door.
00:33:30.091,00:33:33.052,"They're sharpshooters, Michael. They won't miss."
00:33:33.094,00:33:34.596,That's why you can't stay here.
00:33:34.638,00:33:36.055,What's going on?
00:33:36.097,00:33:36.974,Go!
00:34:12.133,00:34:13.760,VERONICA: Who's this?
00:34:31.152,00:34:32.111,Hey.
00:34:32.153,00:34:34.740,Nice ride.
00:34:35.240,00:34:37.075,Cop auction. $300.
00:34:38.159,00:34:40.787,You must be Veronica.
00:34:40.829,00:34:45.083,Whoever tipped off the cops about Lincoln Burrows called from this number.
00:34:47.168,00:34:50.129,It wasn't an easy trace.
00:34:50.171,00:34:52.007,Why? What's the problem?
00:34:52.049,00:34:53.967,FLETCH: It's a payphone.
00:34:55.969,00:34:57.512,This is it.
00:34:57.554,00:34:59.347,Anyone could've made that call.
00:34:59.389,00:35:03.142,Any one of the million people who pass through here every day.
00:35:03.184,00:35:04.978,That's empty.
00:35:06.187,00:35:08.565,What about that?
00:35:08.607,00:35:10.734,NICK: Federal Energy Commission.
00:35:12.193,00:35:14.237,Where you going?
00:35:14.279,00:35:17.115,I'm gonna go see if this guy knows what was in there.
00:35:21.912,00:35:23.162,Excuse me.
00:35:23.204,00:35:26.750,Do you know what was in that space before you?
00:35:34.674,00:35:38.428,"NICK: Hey, it was the regional headquarters for a company called Ecofield."
00:35:38.470,00:35:41.139,Terrence Steadman's company?
00:35:54.945,00:35:56.404,Hello?
00:35:57.948,00:35:59.491,Who--who is this?
00:36:01.159,00:36:04.121,"That's the problem, Veronica."
00:36:05.538,00:36:08.750,Now I have one for you.
00:36:10.251,00:36:12.045,"Here, give me the phone."
00:36:12.087,00:36:14.172,"Nick Savrinn, I just wanted to let you know."
00:36:15.298,00:36:17.175,"As of now, both of you are dead."
00:36:20.887,00:36:22.221,"Come on, let's go."
00:36:25.642,00:36:28.227,have one minute to return to their cells.
00:36:28.269,00:36:31.731,Michael! Michael!
00:36:34.109,00:36:35.318,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
00:36:37.154,00:36:39.238,I didn't touch your man.
00:36:39.280,00:36:42.909,Things have changed since we last met.
00:36:45.244,00:36:48.206,"Relax, partner."
00:36:59.300,00:37:01.219,Why'd you take Abruzzi down there?
00:37:05.306,00:37:08.226,Shut up! Where's Michael?
00:37:09.144,00:37:10.228,Where's Michael?
00:37:12.939,00:37:15.233,Michael! Michael!
00:37:25.326,00:37:27.829,Final warning.
00:37:39.382,00:37:41.218,Where have you been?
00:37:42.343,00:37:44.179,All over. Are you all right?
00:37:47.348,00:37:48.266,LINCOLN: Move!
00:37:58.359,00:38:00.278,Are you okay?
00:38:02.906,00:38:04.574,Bellick.
00:38:04.616,00:38:07.202,She's walking.
00:38:07.911,00:38:09.287,"Yeah, astute observation."
00:38:13.332,00:38:15.668,I was tense.
00:38:15.710,00:38:20.548,"Next time you badmouth me to one of my superiors, there are going to be serious consequences."
00:38:20.590,00:38:22.884,"Do I make myself clear, Captain?"
00:38:22.926,00:38:24.177,"Yes, sir."
00:38:24.219,00:38:25.095,Good.
00:38:31.392,00:38:32.560,Sara.
00:38:34.104,00:38:35.396,Sara. Sara.
00:38:36.064,00:38:38.024,Dad?
00:38:41.402,00:38:45.073,"I told you when you took this job, I knew something like this was gonna happen."
00:38:49.410,00:38:54.207,"Well, sweetheart, I just want you to see what you're doing to yourself."
00:38:54.249,00:38:57.335,"I mean, there is nobody that is forcing you to be here."
00:38:58.086,00:38:59.337,"I know. Thanks, Dad."
00:39:04.259,00:39:06.886,All right.
00:39:16.021,00:39:18.023,What's going on?
00:39:18.064,00:39:18.982,"You won't believe it, Fish."
00:39:19.024,00:39:20.733,You've never seen nothing like it.
00:39:20.775,00:39:22.401,Those little Hooker holes were right on.
00:39:22.443,00:39:24.946,All right. Let's get everyone out of here.
00:39:24.988,00:39:27.532,Getting him out of here.
00:39:27.573,00:39:30.160,You're not going to kill him.
00:39:31.452,00:39:33.412,You're not gonna kill him.
00:39:33.454,00:39:35.373,Are you so stupid you're gonna let him walk out that front door?
00:39:35.414,00:39:37.834,LINCOLN: That ain't for you to decide!
00:39:37.876,00:39:40.212,After all he's seen?
00:39:40.253,00:39:41.379,Get out.
00:39:42.463,00:39:43.381,Keep your mouth shut and turn left.
00:39:44.423,00:39:45.842,Get out!
00:39:47.468,00:39:50.388,"If we have a problem, we know where to find you."
00:39:54.600,00:39:56.394,Forget about it.
00:40:16.455,00:40:17.415,No!
00:40:40.939,00:40:42.481,One for the team.
00:41:00.792,00:41:03.502,"Okay. So, this is the complete list of the injured and dead."
00:41:03.544,00:41:06.005,And it's the whole list?
00:41:06.047,00:41:07.590,Thank you very much.
00:41:10.802,00:41:12.429,SARA: Thanks.
00:41:13.805,00:41:15.056,"Hey, Ron."
00:41:15.556,00:41:17.392,Dr. Tancredi.
00:41:20.061,00:41:21.479,"Yeah, me, too."
00:41:22.480,00:41:23.606,"Um, question."
00:41:23.648,00:41:25.024,Mmm-hmm.
00:41:25.066,00:41:29.821,Why'd your department assign inmates on PI to do a toxic mold removal project?
00:41:30.571,00:41:32.949,What toxic mold project?
00:41:34.033,00:41:36.202,"In the, uh, the crawlspace in A-Wing."
00:41:37.829,00:41:41.458,PI didn't go there.
00:41:44.043,00:41:45.795,"Okay, sorry."
00:00:01.376,00:00:05.130,MALE NARRATOR: Previously on Prison Break: SCOFIELD: I'm looking for someone.
00:00:05.172,00:00:07.007,SUCRE: Man killed the Vice President's brother.
00:00:07.048,00:00:09.176,Why you want to see Burrows so bad anyhow?
00:00:09.217,00:00:10.719,Because he's my brother.
00:00:10.761,00:00:12.011,I'm getting you out of here.
00:00:12.053,00:00:13.973,"Not if you designed the place, it isn't."
00:00:14.014,00:00:16.976,You've seen the blueprints.
00:00:17.017,00:00:18.059,I've got them on me.
00:00:19.937,00:00:22.230,"Nick Savrinn. As of now, both of you are dead."
00:00:26.109,00:00:28.028,"Marilyn, no!"
00:00:29.571,00:00:32.032,The chair isn't the only way to take a man's life in prison.
00:00:33.116,00:00:34.159,Your father's already in trouble.
00:00:34.201,00:00:36.077,There's nothing we can do about it.
00:00:37.162,00:00:40.207,"My first assignments on PI, we were up here cleaning out toxic mold."
00:00:40.248,00:00:41.291,PI didn't go there.
00:00:43.126,00:00:45.086,T-BAG: Tyler Robert.
00:00:45.128,00:00:47.046,This here must be your daughter.
00:00:48.256,00:00:50.091,It's over.
00:00:50.133,00:00:52.011,You're not gonna kill him.
00:00:57.057,00:00:58.225,One for the team.
00:01:03.188,00:01:14.366,"SCOFIELD: Seventeen days from now, they strap my brother to an electric chair, send 50,000 volts coursing through his body for a crime he didn't commit."
00:01:15.826,00:01:17.786,I'm here to make sure that doesn't happen.
00:01:21.373,00:01:25.377,I've been in Fox River nearly three weeks now.
00:01:27.046,00:01:31.800,"In that time, I've managed to get out the back of my cell and into the old steam pipes that run beneath the prison."
00:01:33.010,00:01:35.303,Those pipes are our way out.
00:01:37.180,00:01:39.224,Think of this place like it's a map of the US.
00:01:44.145,00:01:48.149,"Infirmary, our exit, that's California."
00:01:48.191,00:01:50.277,The pipes beneath our feet that connect the two...
00:01:50.318,00:01:52.112,Route 66.
00:01:52.153,00:01:54.740,Route 66.
00:01:54.782,00:01:56.324,I assume we're doing this at night.
00:01:58.201,00:02:01.162,"We're locked up, Fish, and your boy is in solitary."
00:02:01.204,00:02:07.586,"How we just gonna fly out of our cages and right into your cell, right into New York City?"
00:02:07.628,00:02:08.963,You're not.
00:02:09.797,00:02:12.173,You're gonna meet me halfway.
00:02:12.215,00:02:13.425,In St. Louis.
00:02:13.467,00:02:15.970,Route 66 runs directly beneath that building.
00:02:16.011,00:02:18.889,It's the only building sitting on top of those tunnels.
00:02:18.931,00:02:22.559,All we gotta do is get in there on PI and dig ourselves an on-ramp.
00:02:23.560,00:02:25.186,Shortly after we hit the infirmary.
00:02:25.228,00:02:27.188,Then we'll be outside those walls.
00:02:27.230,00:02:29.775,What's in there?
00:02:30.484,00:02:31.944,It's an old storage room.
00:02:31.986,00:02:33.946,I figure John here can pull all the strings he needs.
00:02:33.988,00:02:36.281,"ABRUZZI: It's not that easy, Fish."
00:02:40.243,00:02:44.164,There's gotta be some actual work to be done in there for me to get in there.
00:02:44.205,00:02:46.249,Then you better figure it out.
00:02:46.291,00:02:50.253,"'Cause if we don't get in that room, we're not getting out of here."
00:02:50.295,00:02:51.296,T-BAG: I'm feeling kind of left out.
00:02:52.339,00:02:56.259,"New York, California, St. Louis..."
00:02:56.301,00:02:57.594,What are we discussing?
00:02:57.636,00:02:58.219,"Talking baseball, actually."
00:02:58.261,00:02:59.429,Huh.
00:03:01.264,00:03:04.183,"Now, that's a subject I just happen to know quite a bit about."
00:03:04.225,00:03:06.728,What a shame.
00:03:08.105,00:03:10.189,"Really, now, that any way to treat a teammate?"
00:03:14.611,00:03:18.365,I'm coming along on this endeavor whether you like it or not.
00:03:19.908,00:03:22.410,'Cause I got a hell of a singing voice otherwise.
00:03:25.330,00:03:27.206,I won't take that piece of crap along.
00:03:27.248,00:03:28.207,I won't do it.
00:03:28.249,00:03:29.751,"Me, neither."
00:03:29.793,00:03:31.252,We won't have to.
00:03:31.294,00:03:33.547,He'll be out of the picture soon enough.
00:03:38.510,00:03:42.430,Plus donations from the Illinois Corrections Officers' Foundation.
00:03:42.472,00:03:46.143,"That's the last thing on my mind right now, Warden."
00:03:47.352,00:03:49.437,Do you know who killed him?
00:03:49.479,00:03:50.939,We have some leads.
00:03:51.773,00:03:53.274,But I can promise you this.
00:03:53.316,00:03:56.904,We are not going to rest until we find out what happened.
00:03:57.612,00:03:59.656,His pictures are missing.
00:04:05.328,00:04:07.247,Not to worry.
00:04:10.918,00:04:13.294,I begged him not to take this job.
00:04:13.336,00:04:16.297,"Shauna, I am so sorry."
00:04:20.552,00:04:22.554,I'll walk you to your car.
00:04:23.931,00:04:26.934,"Captain, I need to speak with you for a second."
00:04:26.975,00:04:28.309,BELLICK: I'll meet you in the hallway.
00:04:31.354,00:04:35.525,I want the son of a bitch who did this.
00:04:35.567,00:04:38.278,"Now, you do whatever you need to do to find him."
00:04:39.196,00:04:41.031,You understand?
00:04:46.578,00:04:48.580,We have five boxes.
00:04:53.585,00:04:54.836,That phone call was textbook scare tactics.
00:04:54.878,00:04:56.296,That's what they want.
00:04:56.337,00:04:57.338,They want to scare us from doing what they know we can do.
00:04:57.380,00:04:59.340,And what's that?
00:04:59.382,00:05:01.093,Expose them.
00:05:01.135,00:05:03.095,"This guy bothering you again, Miss Donovan?"
00:05:03.137,00:05:05.346,"No, Lukasz."
00:05:05.388,00:05:06.765,It was a misunderstanding.
00:05:06.807,00:05:09.143,Okay.
00:05:09.184,00:05:10.811,Trust me.
00:05:12.980,00:05:15.190,Here. Let me.
00:05:19.402,00:05:22.614,Those boxes contain seven years of criminal appellate work.
00:05:22.656,00:05:28.703,"If there's a precedent in there somewhere that can help us suspend Lincoln's execution, we're gonna find it."
00:05:30.413,00:05:31.665,"You can just leave those by the door, Lukasz, I'll bring them in."
00:05:31.706,00:05:33.875,"Oh, that's okay."
00:05:35.418,00:05:38.297,"If I didn't know better, I would say Lukasz was sweet on you."
00:05:38.337,00:05:39.338,Very funny.
00:06:30.473,00:06:32.059,ABRUZZI: Fire.
00:06:32.100,00:06:33.310,What?
00:06:33.352,00:06:35.103,Fire.
00:06:35.145,00:06:36.479,How's that gonna help us?
00:06:36.521,00:06:42.443,"A few years ago, the chapel burned down, and the D.O.C. realized they had some toxic issues."
00:06:42.485,00:06:45.364,"You know, asbestos, lead paint, you name it."
00:06:45.404,00:06:49.450,"They couldn't find a contractor, so they put the inmates on the job."
00:06:49.492,00:06:52.287,"We spent like five, six hours in there at a time."
00:06:52.329,00:06:56.499,"But the good news is, no guards came around almost at all."
00:06:57.667,00:06:59.460,Can you get us in there?
00:06:59.502,00:07:02.381,"Been doing a little, uh, thinking."
00:07:07.094,00:07:10.722,"I'm gonna need a PI card, aren't I?"
00:07:13.516,00:07:17.437,"I mean, that's where this whole thing is happening, isn't it?"
00:07:18.105,00:07:19.522,It's on its way.
00:07:22.734,00:07:24.527,"You're slow-walking me, aren't you?"
00:07:24.569,00:07:26.029,Why would I do such a thing?
00:07:26.071,00:07:29.574,"T-BAG: You think Bellick's gonna pop me for shanking that CO, Bob."
00:07:31.076,00:07:34.079,"Maybe you'll take a little walk and tell him for yourself, right?"
00:07:34.121,00:07:36.581,And I'll be out of your hair for good.
00:07:38.541,00:07:44.464,"If I go down for killing Bob, believe me, I'm gonna take a little walk of my own."
00:07:46.049,00:07:48.468,Tell them about that hole you got behind your toilet.
00:07:52.555,00:07:57.394,"So, how about that PI card?"
00:07:59.271,00:08:08.280,"LJ: I don't know if you remember, but that summer before fifth grade, when I stayed with you a couple weeks, and you thought I broke your glass coffee table?"
00:08:08.322,00:08:09.697,Uh-huh.
00:08:10.907,00:08:13.034,"And when you came home, I denied it."
00:08:14.119,00:08:21.293,"But you told me you could care less about the coffee table, you just didn't want me lying to you."
00:08:21.335,00:08:28.549,"And you said I'd feel a lot better if I just told you the truth, and you promised not to be angry."
00:08:28.591,00:08:30.635,I remember.
00:08:31.594,00:08:33.554,"Well, I broke it."
00:08:35.849,00:08:37.517,I know.
00:08:39.936,00:08:47.527,"You know, if there's anything that you want to get off of your chest, you can tell me, and I promise I won't get angry."
00:08:48.653,00:08:50.364,You want to know if I killed that guy?
00:08:55.869,00:08:58.830,"I, uh, went there planning to do something wrong."
00:09:01.875,00:09:03.460,But I didn't kill that guy.
00:09:03.502,00:09:07.297,Someone's working hard to make it look like I did.
00:09:10.633,00:09:12.386,What?
00:09:12.427,00:09:18.308,"Veronica's working my case, and I got a reporter coming today who actually believes I'm innocent."
00:09:18.892,00:09:20.935,So I ain't dead yet.
00:09:22.020,00:09:24.647,"LJ, look at me."
00:09:25.648,00:09:27.526,"You gotta have faith, kid."
00:09:42.665,00:09:43.624,WOMAN: Well?
00:09:43.666,00:09:44.125,Taken care of.
00:09:44.167,00:09:45.626,Good.
00:09:45.668,00:09:48.088,Now move on to the second thing.
00:09:48.129,00:09:51.632,"If you could see what we're looking at, believe me, Burrows is gonna get the message."
00:09:51.674,00:09:53.634,Which is what you've assured me of before.
00:09:53.676,00:09:57.222,Yet that message keeps getting returned to sender.
00:09:57.264,00:10:00.683,"Now move on the second thing, and report back."
00:10:00.725,00:10:02.143,We're headed there now.
00:10:04.687,00:10:06.689,"Yeah, God forbid."
00:10:12.695,00:10:16.199,SUCRE: He's gonna toss every cell in this block until he finds the killer.
00:10:16.241,00:10:19.660,"If he tosses this one, he's going to find the hole back there in a heartbeat."
00:10:19.702,00:10:20.703,I know.
00:10:21.704,00:10:23.998,SUCRE: We gotta turn T-Bag in.
00:10:24.040,00:10:25.166,That's the only way it'll stop.
00:10:25.208,00:10:27.502,"We turn him in, he'll talk."
00:10:32.424,00:10:35.009,"So we're screwed either way, aren't we?"
00:10:41.724,00:10:43.684,Which one?
00:11:09.919,00:11:11.712,What the hell are you doing here?
00:11:11.754,00:11:13.714,Clean-up detail.
00:11:13.756,00:11:15.716,"Does this look like storage to you, you idiot?"
00:11:15.758,00:11:17.093,It's a restricted area.
00:11:17.135,00:11:19.137,This is a CO break room.
00:11:20.263,00:11:21.264,Back it up now!
00:11:23.558,00:11:24.559,Won't happen again.
00:11:40.116,00:11:42.952,SUCRE: A freaking break room?
00:11:42.994,00:11:44.745,SCOFIELD: They must've changed it since the retrofit.
00:11:44.787,00:11:46.747,The bulls are camped out in there.
00:11:46.789,00:11:48.082,They'll never leave.
00:11:48.124,00:11:50.377,You got a back-up plan?
00:11:50.418,00:11:51.878,It's the only room sitting on top of that pipe.
00:11:51.919,00:11:54.506,"It's the only way out, and we gotta get back in there."
00:11:54.548,00:11:55.756,"Impossible, Fish."
00:11:55.798,00:11:57.676,Maybe not.
00:12:00.845,00:12:02.013,SUCRE: I don't get it.
00:12:02.055,00:12:04.140,How come they let him into the guards' room?
00:12:04.182,00:12:05.392,He's a trustee.
00:12:06.809,00:12:08.811,But why him?
00:12:08.853,00:12:10.438,How does one become a trustee?
00:12:10.480,00:12:12.857,Just have a spotless record for the last 30 years.
00:12:14.817,00:12:16.777,Which means we've got to get him onboard.
00:12:16.819,00:12:19.698,Forget it.
00:12:25.995,00:12:27.830,Mr. Westmoreland.
00:12:28.540,00:12:29.790,"Hey, Michael."
00:12:31.626,00:12:32.793,You found your cat yet?
00:12:32.835,00:12:34.753,Still MIA.
00:12:35.838,00:12:37.924,You can always get another.
00:12:37.965,00:12:40.176,I don't want another.
00:12:40.968,00:12:42.136,"Besides, it's a moot point."
00:12:42.178,00:12:43.804,She was grandfathered.
00:12:43.846,00:12:44.972,"Once she's gone, no more pets."
00:12:46.391,00:12:48.767,Wouldn't be an issue if you were on the outside.
00:12:49.977,00:12:51.938,"Still tugging on that leash, eh?"
00:12:51.979,00:12:53.814,Yep.
00:12:57.860,00:13:00.071,'Cause you still think I'm D.B. Cooper.
00:13:00.113,00:13:02.115,I don't think.
00:13:04.033,00:13:08.787,"The way I see it, you're in here doing 60-to-life for a vehicular manslaughter."
00:13:08.829,00:13:12.791,"It would've been 20, but the car you were in was stolen."
00:13:12.833,00:13:15.878,"Felony murder rule cubes up your sentence, and here you are."
00:13:16.879,00:13:18.839,Hitting that woman was an accident.
00:13:18.881,00:13:20.174,But the car?
00:13:21.217,00:13:22.927,No one accidentally steals a car.
00:13:22.969,00:13:32.811,"So the question is, why would Charles Westmoreland be in Arizona boosting a car, 10 states away from where he lived, and only 10 miles away from the Mexican border?"
00:13:32.853,00:13:46.825,"And why, two days before that, would someone make a phone call to his wife from a motel in Portland, a stone's throw away from the airport out of which, shortly after, Flight 305 was hijacked by one D.B. Cooper."
00:13:47.868,00:13:53.874,"Seven hours after the hijacking, records show Charles Westmoreland was treated for a busted knee at a free clinic in Brigham City."
00:13:53.916,00:14:04.010,"Only way to get from Portland, Oregon, to Brigham City, Utah in seven hours, is in a car, breaking every land-speed record known to man, or flying."
00:14:04.051,00:14:08.222,It's public record D.B. Cooper jumped out of that 727 about an hour after takeoff.
00:14:09.390,00:14:17.816,"Taking a dive at 10,000 feet with $1.5 million in cash and a hastily packed parachute might make for a pretty rough landing."
00:14:17.856,00:14:20.109,Rough enough to shatter some bones.
00:14:20.151,00:14:21.235,Maybe even a left knee.
00:14:23.571,00:14:26.324,D.B. Cooper would've had a car waiting for him when he landed.
00:14:26.366,00:14:31.871,"According to D.M.V. records, in 1971, Charles Westmoreland was the proud owner of a '65 Chevy Nova."
00:14:32.955,00:14:47.428,"As it happens, a '65 Chevy Nova with the registration number scraped off was found abandoned with a blown gasket along the Arizona border a mile or two away from where you accidentally hit that woman with your stolen car."
00:14:49.972,00:14:50.931,Interesting story.
00:14:50.973,00:14:53.351,Interesting man.
00:14:55.562,00:14:56.937,But you didn't answer one thing.
00:14:56.979,00:14:58.815,What's that?
00:15:00.567,00:15:07.699,"Maybe I did hurt my knee, I did steal that car, and I did accidentally hit that poor lady."
00:15:08.783,00:15:17.417,"But how could I have hijacked a plane in Portland on November 24th, when I was in Folsom, finishing up a 30-day drunk and disorderly?"
00:15:22.129,00:15:28.135,"I hope you aren't hanging this whole escape on that money, 'cause I'm not the one in possession of it."
00:15:32.014,00:15:34.768,"Thanks for the invite, though."
00:15:50.283,00:15:51.618,Veronica.
00:15:55.037,00:15:56.038,"Veronica, come on."
00:16:02.044,00:16:02.962,We're okay.
00:16:04.046,00:16:05.089,"How is this okay, Nick?"
00:16:05.131,00:16:07.717,Somebody just tried to kill us.
00:16:07.759,00:16:09.969,I know.
00:16:10.010,00:16:12.806,We just watched a man burn to death right in front of us.
00:16:15.057,00:16:16.016,My God.
00:16:18.394,00:16:20.020,Lukasz. My God.
00:16:20.062,00:16:21.105,"It's okay, it's okay."
00:16:21.147,00:16:23.900,We just left him there.
00:16:25.025,00:16:26.319,There was nothing we could do for him.
00:16:26.360,00:16:28.154,He was dead as soon as he opened the door.
00:16:28.195,00:16:31.699,"I am trying so hard to understand all this, Nick."
00:16:31.741,00:16:33.200,"Who these people are, what they want."
00:16:33.242,00:16:36.454,How we just walked away from there without even calling the police.
00:16:36.496,00:16:40.124,We did it because these people we're dealing with won't stop until we're dead.
00:16:40.166,00:16:43.503,"Now, if they think we're dead, like they do right now, maybe we get a little breathing room here."
00:16:43.544,00:16:44.754,We figure out what our next move is.
00:16:44.796,00:16:46.756,"No, we should go to the police."
00:16:46.798,00:16:49.008,I've been telling myself the same thing.
00:16:49.049,00:16:50.050,They're bigger than the police.
00:16:54.096,00:17:00.186,"Now, we go to the authorities, and all we're gonna be doing, is broadcasting to them that we're still alive and then we got their target right on our backs again."
00:17:01.771,00:17:03.230,We can't hide forever.
00:17:04.231,00:17:07.109,"No, no, maybe not forever."
00:17:08.778,00:17:10.154,"I think I know a place we can, at least for a little while."
00:17:15.326,00:17:17.328,We'll just have to go in there ourselves then.
00:17:17.370,00:17:20.164,"Like I said, unless the old man's in, it's not possible."
00:17:20.206,00:17:25.503,"And even if it were, with the guards in there, there's no way in hell they're just gonna sit back and watch us start a fire."
00:17:25.545,00:17:27.338,"See, I already figured that part out."
00:17:29.131,00:17:30.508,And?
00:17:34.012,00:17:36.305,Can you get some out of there?
00:17:36.347,00:17:39.183,"Look, there's a coffee maker in the guards' room, right?"
00:17:39.225,00:17:42.269,I got a hook-up with one of my boys in the kitchen.
00:17:42.311,00:17:47.233,"If we can get rubber cement in the bottom of that coffee pot, when the burner goes on..."
00:17:50.152,00:17:51.738,It's a good idea.
00:17:53.155,00:17:54.240,"But without Westmoreland, we're never getting in that room."
00:17:55.575,00:17:57.827,He doesn't want any part of the escape?
00:17:57.869,00:18:00.246,"Well, what does he want?"
00:18:01.163,00:18:03.249,Everybody wants something.
00:18:12.174,00:18:15.720,"SCOFIELD: Come on, kitty."
00:18:16.429,00:18:19.181,"Here, kitty, kitty, kitty."
00:18:23.185,00:18:24.228,Come on.
00:18:29.233,00:18:32.111,I don't believe it.
00:18:33.320,00:18:36.156,Thank you.
00:18:36.198,00:18:37.575,Where'd you find her?
00:18:37.617,00:18:39.201,In the yard.
00:18:44.206,00:18:47.167,Not a string.
00:18:51.297,00:18:54.216,I'm not D.B. Cooper.
00:18:56.135,00:18:59.179,'Cause it's not gonna take D.B. Cooper to do what I need done.
00:18:59.221,00:19:00.139,What's that?
00:19:08.272,00:19:10.066,Why?
00:19:11.275,00:19:15.195,Let's just say it'd be in everyone's best interest if a fire were to start in there.
00:19:15.237,00:19:18.198,"Marilyn, did you think he was the arsonist type?"
00:19:19.533,00:19:22.328,I'm not.
00:19:23.746,00:19:25.289,The type that gets access to all kinds of tools.
00:19:28.250,00:19:31.337,"Michael, I'm grateful for this, I really am."
00:19:32.630,00:19:36.216,But I've made it a point to keep my nose clean ever since I walked into this place.
00:19:36.258,00:19:38.177,32 years without a blemish.
00:19:39.929,00:19:42.222,"If that parole board date ever comes, I want to be ready."
00:19:42.264,00:19:44.224,I can't jeopardize that.
00:19:45.559,00:19:46.894,Sorry.
00:19:51.149,00:19:53.192,Michael.
00:19:54.485,00:19:56.278,"Thanks, though. Really."
00:20:01.241,00:20:04.244,"After what you went through in the riot, I thought you might take a day off."
00:20:04.286,00:20:06.413,I'm fine.
00:20:13.295,00:20:15.339,I hope you don't feel like you owe me anything.
00:20:16.215,00:20:19.301,"I do. I'm, uh..."
00:20:21.595,00:20:24.223,I really appreciate what you did for me.
00:20:29.311,00:20:30.813,But?
00:20:34.316,00:20:40.406,"But you told me that you had been up in the crawlspace for PI, and..."
00:20:41.490,00:20:42.241,PI was never assigned to go there.
00:20:50.416,00:20:52.292,"Michael, don't be like that."
00:20:52.334,00:20:54.336,I just want some answers.
00:20:55.504,00:20:56.964,"Thanks for the shot, Doc."
00:21:00.176,00:21:02.261,"Sue Parsons, Headline Press."
00:21:05.305,00:21:07.307,I appreciate your taking the time.
00:21:07.349,00:21:09.560,Appreciate you looking into my case.
00:21:09.602,00:21:12.646,"So, what can you tell me?"
00:21:09.602,00:21:15.315,"From what I understand, you have numerous people working on your behalf as we speak."
00:21:15.357,00:21:16.483,"Yeah, um..."
00:21:16.525,00:21:20.320,"Well, Veronica Donovan."
00:21:20.362,00:21:21.321,And Nick Savrinn.
00:21:21.363,00:21:24.951,He works at Project Justice.
00:21:25.910,00:21:27.870,Okay.
00:21:27.912,00:21:30.456,Nothing to go to court with.
00:21:32.458,00:21:34.334,You ever think it's just time to let go?
00:21:34.376,00:21:37.337,Accept what happened?
00:21:37.379,00:21:38.923,"Let go, yeah."
00:21:38.965,00:21:40.174,"Accept what happened, never."
00:21:40.216,00:21:45.512,"I mean, would you, if someone had set you up, destroyed your life?"
00:21:45.554,00:21:50.935,I guess I'm thinking in terms of the pain and anguish it's caused your friends and loved ones.
00:21:50.977,00:21:53.353,"People who care about me, they believe me."
00:21:53.395,00:21:56.315,That's all that matters to me right now.
00:21:57.357,00:21:59.318,You have a son.
00:22:00.402,00:22:02.113,Yeah. Why?
00:22:02.155,00:22:09.536,"I have a source that tells me if you accept what happened, and stop fighting your execution, your son will be left out of this."
00:22:09.578,00:22:14.167,"If not, I hope you said goodbye to him when he left here this morning."
00:22:15.417,00:22:17.461,Who are you?
00:22:19.421,00:22:21.174,Who are you?
00:22:21.215,00:22:24.135,"Hey, don't let her go!"
00:22:24.177,00:22:27.471,"Please, no!"
00:22:27.513,00:22:28.097,No!
00:22:39.525,00:22:40.734,LJ Burrows?
00:22:40.776,00:22:42.236,Yeah.
00:22:42.278,00:22:44.446,I'm Officer Hale with juvenile court.
00:22:44.488,00:22:46.615,We just need to do a quick survey of the residence.
00:22:46.657,00:22:50.286,Make sure the environment here is reflective of the terms of your probation.
00:22:50.328,00:22:51.329,Your parents home?
00:22:51.369,00:22:53.789,No. But they'll be home any minute.
00:22:54.748,00:22:57.877,"Well, then, I can get started."
00:23:00.462,00:23:02.422,"LJ and his dad, you never said how it went this morning."
00:23:02.464,00:23:04.424,Sounded fine.
00:23:04.466,00:23:07.345,"Of course, everything a 15-year-old boy tells his mother is fine."
00:23:07.385,00:23:10.264,"Look, no offense, but can I see some kind of identification?"
00:23:10.306,00:23:11.265,Sure.
00:23:16.145,00:23:17.521,"LJ, you here?"
00:23:22.484,00:23:24.611,"Oh, my God."
00:23:24.653,00:23:26.364,"Drop the phone, lady."
00:23:26.404,00:23:27.114,This is the only warning I'm giving you.
00:23:27.156,00:23:29.407,Drop it.
00:23:31.493,00:23:32.370,Run!
00:23:32.410,00:23:34.705,"LJ, go!"
00:23:49.136,00:23:51.429,Pick up.
00:23:52.181,00:23:53.431,Please answer.
00:23:56.352,00:23:57.311,KELLERMAN: LJ.
00:23:57.353,00:24:00.480,We're not here to hurt you.
00:24:04.360,00:24:05.527,Wh-Whoa.
00:24:06.112,00:24:10.116,911. Send.
00:24:11.491,00:24:14.452,You really think you're gonna get to four buttons before I get to one?
00:24:19.541,00:24:21.001,Come on.
00:24:23.337,00:24:24.462,"LJ, get out of here!"
00:24:36.350,00:24:37.475,Mom.
00:25:07.131,00:25:08.466,"KELLERMAN: Where are you going, LJ?"
00:25:08.506,00:25:09.925,What do you want from me?
00:25:09.967,00:25:11.551,"Cooperation, that's all."
00:25:11.593,00:25:12.886,You want cooperation?
00:25:14.263,00:25:16.015,"I know what you look like, you son of a bitch!"
00:25:16.056,00:25:17.975,I'm going to the police.
00:25:18.017,00:25:20.602,Going to the police.
00:25:20.644,00:25:23.897,"I mean, with your prints on the murder weapon and all."
00:25:23.939,00:25:25.441,I didn't touch the murder weapon.
00:25:25.483,00:25:26.524,Of course you didn't.
00:25:27.609,00:25:34.992,"I know that and you know that, I just don't think you're gonna have much luck convincing Ballistics of that."
00:25:35.034,00:25:36.285,Who the hell are you people?
00:25:36.327,00:25:37.995,Just concerned neighbors.
00:25:38.037,00:25:40.039,We heard a bit of a ruckus at the Rix's house.
00:25:40.080,00:25:43.625,"Gosh, you know, I guess we really should've seen it coming."
00:25:43.667,00:25:47.505,"I mean, all the signs were there, drug use, decline in academic performance."
00:25:47.545,00:25:49.589,But we didn't think he'd ever do something like this.
00:25:49.631,00:25:50.883,No one's gonna believe that.
00:25:50.924,00:25:52.510,"Yes, they will."
00:25:52.550,00:25:55.971,"And when they catch you, and they will catch you, LJ, they're gonna try you as an adult."
00:25:56.013,00:25:57.139,You know what that means.
00:25:58.556,00:26:00.518,"We can help you, LJ."
00:26:00.558,00:26:01.601,"No, you're not."
00:26:10.652,00:26:13.280,"She made that choice, not you."
00:26:14.281,00:26:16.367,Let's find the kid.
00:26:23.332,00:26:26.043,You got Marilyn back.
00:26:26.544,00:26:27.545,Sure did.
00:26:27.920,00:26:30.047,That's good.
00:26:31.673,00:26:33.926,How long ago you quit smoking?
00:26:34.843,00:26:36.970,A little over nine years now.
00:26:37.012,00:26:38.514,"You don't mind, do you?"
00:26:47.731,00:26:50.943,"Feel a kinship with you, Charles."
00:26:55.864,00:26:58.492,More than any other con here.
00:26:59.493,00:27:01.203,"And we've seen a lot, haven't we?"
00:27:02.037,00:27:03.621,Sure have.
00:27:04.706,00:27:09.627,"And correct me if I'm wrong, but I've always treated you fair."
00:27:09.669,00:27:13.132,I've always appreciated that fact.
00:27:15.301,00:27:17.635,I've known Bob since he was 18 years old.
00:27:20.139,00:27:22.015,I got him this job.
00:27:23.725,00:27:26.437,You can imagine how responsible I feel.
00:27:26.479,00:27:29.523,"I can't help you with that, boss."
00:27:29.565,00:27:31.150,I think you can.
00:27:32.234,00:27:32.985,Word is he died in front of your cell.
00:27:34.194,00:27:36.780,And you were right here when it happened.
00:27:41.785,00:27:52.004,"We've both been around long enough to know that when a con starts that snitching business, he's not long for this world."
00:27:52.045,00:27:54.714,"Don't put me in that position, boss."
00:28:01.054,00:28:11.064,"If you don't tell me who killed Bob before I leave this cell, our friendship goes with it."
00:28:19.781,00:28:21.033,That's a nice cat.
00:28:27.705,00:28:31.835,"Westmoreland knows, and his jaw ain't that strong."
00:29:19.425,00:29:20.884,NURSE: What's this?
00:29:21.843,00:29:23.429,Nothing.
00:29:27.015,00:29:30.436,I'm not a stalker.
00:29:30.477,00:29:31.811,I don't get it.
00:29:33.855,00:29:35.857,He doesn't fit the profile.
00:29:35.899,00:29:38.611,Right? The man's got a graduate degree.
00:29:38.652,00:29:39.861,He lives in my neighborhood.
00:29:41.071,00:29:46.034,"Guys like that hang out in Streeterville, they drink single malt Scotch, they pay $200 for Cubs tickets."
00:29:46.076,00:29:47.327,They don't rob banks.
00:29:47.369,00:29:49.829,Maybe he couldn't afford season tickets.
00:29:49.871,00:29:51.248,Maybe that's why he robbed the bank.
00:29:51.290,00:29:53.792,Thank you.
00:29:53.833,00:29:56.420,Can I ask you something?
00:29:56.462,00:29:58.171,Yeah.
00:29:58.213,00:30:00.048,Why do you care so much?
00:30:00.090,00:30:02.551,'Cause he lied to me.
00:30:02.593,00:30:04.303,They all lie to you.
00:30:09.057,00:30:12.852,Maybe because he's the one guy in here I can actually get to.
00:30:12.894,00:30:18.024,One guy I can make a difference with.
00:30:19.901,00:30:22.862,"Go home, girl."
00:30:22.904,00:30:26.825,"You keep burning it at both ends like this, you're gonna drive yourself crazy."
00:30:26.866,00:30:28.952,Good night.
00:30:32.914,00:30:34.874,"POPE: I'm sorry, Burrows."
00:30:34.916,00:30:38.211,Both of them were dead by the time the paramedics got there.
00:30:39.879,00:30:40.922,What about my son?
00:30:40.964,00:30:42.174,He's missing.
00:30:43.425,00:30:45.427,The police are treating him as a fugitive.
00:30:47.012,00:30:48.180,A fugitive?
00:30:48.221,00:30:51.183,They found his prints on the murder weapon.
00:30:51.224,00:30:53.519,It's impossible.
00:30:53.560,00:30:54.894,"I, uh..."
00:30:54.936,00:30:56.605,I need to call him.
00:30:58.982,00:31:01.026,His life's in danger!
00:31:01.067,00:31:05.030,The police have instructed me that this is an ongoing investigation.
00:31:05.071,00:31:13.913,"And as such, any contact you make with your son could potentially aid and abet him as a fugitive."
00:31:13.955,00:31:16.041,I'm sorry.
00:31:16.958,00:31:18.168,"Warden, please!"
00:31:23.965,00:31:25.592,GUARD: Front gate open!
00:31:37.479,00:31:38.897,"Let's go, man."
00:31:40.649,00:31:42.192,"That's messed up, man."
00:31:42.234,00:31:43.943,"Jeez, do he even know?"
00:31:43.985,00:31:44.944,INMATE 1: I don't think so.
00:31:44.986,00:31:47.030,"INMATE 2: Man, here he is."
00:32:21.022,00:32:22.941,"TROKEY: What's up, T?"
00:32:24.025,00:32:26.986,"We family, right?"
00:32:29.030,00:32:29.989,"Hell, yeah, we are."
00:32:30.031,00:32:35.704,"Well, I'm in a quandary, and I need your help."
00:32:38.998,00:32:43.754,And you were right.
00:32:43.796,00:32:57.016,"Thing is, Trokey, if I get popped for this, what with my priors, and predisposition to violent behavior, I'll spend the rest of my life in the SHU."
00:32:57.058,00:33:05.066,But if you come forward with only your drug convictions and a whole lot of remorse...
00:33:05.108,00:33:06.568,"I can't do that, T."
00:33:06.610,00:33:09.028,No need.
00:33:09.070,00:33:11.824,"I mean, you understand that, don't you?"
00:33:12.532,00:33:14.326,"You ain't mad, are you?"
00:33:17.454,00:33:20.206,"No, Trokey, I'm not mad."
00:34:41.538,00:34:44.041,I need out.
00:34:45.959,00:34:48.921,You will. Both of us. Soon.
00:34:48.962,00:34:50.296,You've gotta trust me.
00:34:50.338,00:34:52.131,We're gonna get this done.
00:34:52.173,00:34:54.259,"How? Tell me, Michael, tell me."
00:34:54.300,00:34:56.011,"You can't, can you?"
00:34:56.053,00:34:59.806,I gotta get out of here now.
00:35:03.184,00:35:04.644,Just stick with me.
00:35:15.405,00:35:17.407,"Yo, Bruce! Hey!"
00:35:18.199,00:35:20.619,"What's up, bro?"
00:35:44.225,00:35:47.186,"If you go out there, they will gun you down."
00:35:47.228,00:35:48.897,I don't care anymore.
00:35:48.939,00:35:51.190,"Well, you better start thinking about what you're doing."
00:35:51.232,00:35:52.567,Because you can't help LJ if you're dead.
00:35:52.609,00:35:55.112,GUARD: What the hell's going on in here?
00:35:55.153,00:35:56.529,We got a problem?
00:35:56.571,00:35:58.907,"Well, then get on your feet."
00:35:58.949,00:36:00.283,Let's go.
00:36:01.409,00:36:03.244,Son of a...
00:36:03.286,00:36:05.330,What the hell's going on in Building 2? Come in.
00:36:06.706,00:36:09.167,Fire in the CO break room.
00:36:31.940,00:36:34.317,Thanks.
00:36:43.827,00:36:45.704,Found the source.
00:36:47.246,00:36:48.790,Bilsons?
00:36:53.419,00:36:54.921,"Captain Bellick, got someone to see you."
00:36:58.299,00:37:00.218,What the hell do you want?
00:37:27.913,00:37:30.415,I don't know how that got there.
00:37:32.918,00:37:36.295,It's a mock. A mock!
00:37:36.337,00:37:38.173,Bad enough you killed a guard.
00:37:38.215,00:37:40.299,Don't try to lay it off on somebody else now.
00:37:40.341,00:37:43.220,You set me up!
00:37:56.733,00:37:58.317,Wow.
00:37:58.359,00:38:00.195,Your father lived here?
00:38:00.237,00:38:03.322,He wanted someplace that was completely off the grid.
00:38:03.364,00:38:05.324,A place the government didn't even know existed.
00:38:05.366,00:38:07.326,He tapped into the power lines.
00:38:07.368,00:38:09.537,A well supplies the place with water.
00:38:09.579,00:38:12.707,Last few years of his life he barely even left the property.
00:38:12.749,00:38:14.500,It's...
00:38:16.377,00:38:25.929,"When you spend so many years fighting cops and prosecutors and judges trying to take your freedom for something you didn't do, you used every cent you had in attorney's fees, you wind up losing anyway."
00:38:28.181,00:38:33.812,"Fifteen years of his life, almost all of his son's childhood."
00:38:37.232,00:38:41.319,"I guess I can forgive him for wanting to hide away, be left alone."
00:38:42.779,00:38:45.282,We'll be safe here until we figure out our next move.
00:38:55.416,00:38:57.127,There seems to be a bit of confusion.
00:38:57.169,00:38:59.545,I-I'm supposed to be on this detail.
00:38:59.587,00:39:01.339,I don't think so.
00:39:01.673,00:39:02.882,"Oh, John."
00:39:04.425,00:39:05.969,You can't be serious.
00:39:07.512,00:39:10.348,Not after our long illustrious history we shared together.
00:39:11.432,00:39:14.686,All those nights in New York City.
00:39:15.436,00:39:17.355,In California.
00:39:19.440,00:39:21.276,In St. Louis.
00:39:22.443,00:39:23.862,"They were good times, weren't they, John?"
00:39:26.405,00:39:28.116,Tell the badge here about them.
00:39:28.158,00:39:32.370,"'Cause if you don't want to, I certainly could."
00:39:43.798,00:39:46.343,BELLICK: I want this place gutted.
00:39:46.384,00:39:48.053,The drywall's gotta be torn out.
00:39:48.094,00:39:49.428,The studs gotta be removed.
00:39:49.470,00:39:51.472,"Boss, we got some toxic issues here."
00:39:51.514,00:39:53.432,"Asbestos, to start with."
00:39:53.474,00:39:55.434,Take it up with the union.
00:39:55.476,00:39:58.313,"All I'm saying is, this room is your only priority now."
00:39:58.355,00:40:01.107,It better be brand spanking new when you're done.
00:40:01.149,00:40:08.740,"If anybody's thinking about getting cute, trying to trunk one of these tools out of here, Brady's got the outline of every single piece of hardware in here."
00:40:08.781,00:40:15.454,"And at the end of every day, every single piece better match up, or you're all going to the hole."
00:40:29.761,00:40:31.054,Let's go.
00:40:38.103,00:40:39.020,This goes down four feet.
00:40:39.062,00:40:40.855,It connects to the main line below.
00:40:40.897,00:40:46.403,"All we gotta do is widen it, and we've got ourselves an on-ramp to Route 66."
00:40:52.658,00:40:53.743,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:40:54.660,00:40:55.494,"They're gonna hear this, man."
00:40:55.536,00:40:56.537,They won't.
00:41:07.548,00:41:09.634,"Come on, pretty."
00:41:18.768,00:41:21.520,"Best get cracking, eh?"
00:41:41.833,00:41:44.836,You really think you're gonna get to four buttons before I get to one?
00:42:05.648,00:42:06.691,WOMAN: I don't have my glasses.
00:42:06.732,00:42:10.278,How 'bout you read this for me?
00:42:11.488,00:42:12.989,Tell me the news.
00:42:13.031,00:42:18.577,"Evidently, there was an explosion in a Gold Coast apartment in Chicago yesterday."
00:42:18.619,00:42:21.539,Gas line.
00:42:21.580,00:42:23.791,Shame.
00:42:23.833,00:42:25.793,How about that kid up in Oak Park?
00:42:25.835,00:42:27.586,The one they say killed his parents.
00:42:27.628,00:42:29.214,"Oh, they got him."
00:42:29.255,00:42:31.508,He's in custody.
00:42:32.342,00:42:34.969,I imagine heads would've rolled if he hadn't been caught.
00:42:35.011,00:42:37.305,Lives would've been lost.
00:42:39.015,00:42:40.892,How about you hand that back to me?
00:42:40.933,00:42:45.313,"Now that it's yesterday's news, we can put it behind us, can't we?"
00:42:46.564,00:42:50.276,Move on to the next chapter of our lives.
00:42:52.445,00:42:55.073,"You're not just doing this for me, you know."
00:42:56.074,00:42:57.116,Or my brother.
00:42:57.158,00:42:58.617,Yes?
00:42:58.659,00:43:00.953,"They're ready for you, Madam Vice President."
00:43:02.747,00:43:05.708,You're doing it for your country.

00:00:20.270,00:00:25.066,All we gotta do is get in there on PI and dig ourselves an on-ramp.
00:00:25.108,00:00:26.777,Which one?
00:00:28.320,00:00:29.446,This goes down four feet.

00:00:35.661,00:00:38.330,"I'm gonna find out, you know, what it is you're doing up there."
00:00:38.372,00:00:46.129,"You told me that that you had been up in the crawlspace for PI, and PI was never assigned to go there."
00:00:46.171,00:00:48.423,We got you a little get-well gift.
00:00:48.465,00:00:51.134,What's your name?

00:01:39.349,00:01:43.270,He has the propensity to be a bit gregarious when he shouldn't be.
00:01:44.772,00:01:45.731,Fraternizing in the prison shower.
00:01:45.773,00:01:47.775,Come on.
00:01:51.236,00:01:53.530,"You wouldn't be meddling in my affairs now, would you, Scofield?"
00:01:54.281,00:01:55.574,You can't be that stupid.
00:01:56.951,00:01:59.119,Not when I'm so fully invested in your affairs.
00:02:04.291,00:02:08.336,What's between you and him is between you and him.
00:02:09.337,00:02:11.214,That's what I thought you said.
00:02:24.103,00:02:25.479,You've gotta help me.

00:02:42.245,00:02:45.082,You have got to understand.

00:02:49.336,00:02:53.298,Whatever happens out there is out of my jurisdiction until it comes through those gates.
00:02:53.340,00:02:55.300,It just did.
00:02:56.259,00:02:57.218,What?
00:02:57.260,00:03:00.221,I know how he thinks.
00:03:00.263,00:03:06.227,"Burrows, I would've thought that by now, under the circumstances, you'd understand your position as a death row inmate."

00:03:52.858,00:03:54.234,I'm not gonna warn you again.
00:03:54.275,00:03:55.485,What are you looking at?
00:04:27.434,00:04:29.436,"The bulls find this stuff, they'll know we're digging."
00:04:30.437,00:04:32.397,That's why we gotta get rid of it.
00:04:33.356,00:04:34.315,One piece at a time.
00:04:36.902,00:04:39.279,All prisoners remain 40 feet away from Gate A.
00:04:43.366,00:04:45.326,I repeat.
00:04:45.368,00:04:48.455,All prisoners stay 40 feet away from Gate A.
00:04:48.496,00:04:51.291,New prisoners arriving in five minutes.
00:05:14.731,00:05:16.357,Attention in the yard.
00:05:16.399,00:05:20.320,All prisoners maintain a 40-foot perimeter around Gate A.
00:05:21.321,00:05:23.323,New prisoners arriving.
00:05:31.498,00:05:34.293,"Best put on a jail face, BG."
00:05:34.334,00:05:37.462,"These crabs see you puckering, they gonna bitchify you in a heartbeat."
00:05:37.504,00:05:39.589,Mmm-mmm.
00:06:02.445,00:06:06.241,Looks like I gotta find something else to call you now.
00:06:06.283,00:06:07.408,Why's that?
00:06:07.450,00:06:08.409,'Cause you ain't a fish no more.
00:06:08.451,00:06:11.412,You ain't the newest con in the tank...
00:06:17.669,00:06:19.504,"INMATE 1: Oh, man!"
00:06:21.464,00:06:22.674,"INMATE 2: Yo, yo, get the..."
00:06:22.716,00:06:24.383,"Somebody get this dude, man!"
00:06:25.468,00:06:26.385,INMATE 2: I ain't touching him.
00:06:59.878,00:07:02.214,I could have done something.
00:07:02.256,00:07:03.422,LINCOLN: No.
00:07:04.465,00:07:06.009,T-Bag had his hooks in that kid.
00:07:06.051,00:07:07.844,There was nothing you could have done.
00:07:08.803,00:07:10.513,I could have told the Pope.
00:07:10.555,00:07:12.557,He could have transferred the kid to Ad Seg.
00:07:13.850,00:07:16.436,"Go easy, Michael."
00:07:17.062,00:07:18.563,And that makes it okay?
00:07:20.523,00:07:23.360,I turned my back on him because I didn't wanna make waves.
00:07:23.402,00:07:27.989,It was just easier to look the other way.
00:07:29.824,00:07:31.285,Keep the plan safe.
00:07:31.659,00:07:32.786,And you did.
00:07:32.827,00:07:35.455,But at what price?
00:07:35.496,00:07:36.957,That's not how she raised us.
00:07:39.084,00:07:41.586,"A man's down, you give him your hand."
00:07:43.546,00:07:46.174,She'd roll over in her grave if she knew what I've become.
00:07:46.216,00:07:47.217,"No, she wouldn't."
00:07:48.260,00:07:50.011,"You've given me your hand, Michael."
00:07:50.053,00:07:54.099,My son's out there with a bull's-eye on his back.
00:07:55.558,00:07:58.395,Do whatever you gotta do to get us out of here.
00:08:40.645,00:08:42.147,NICK: What are you doing?
00:08:44.774,00:08:46.734,I was just looking for some coffee.
00:08:48.028,00:08:49.446,"Oh, there isn't any."
00:08:49.488,00:08:52.573,"They belonged to my father, if you were wondering."
00:08:54.284,00:08:56.370,How long have they been in there?
00:08:56.411,00:08:58.413,"I don't know, five years."
00:09:02.583,00:09:05.545,"You know, Veronica, we've been through a lot."
00:09:05.586,00:09:08.382,"And, uh, I'm freaking out here as much as you are."
00:09:08.423,00:09:10.842,"But you get this look in your eye sometimes, like..."
00:09:10.884,00:09:12.427,Like I'm the bad guy.
00:09:15.013,00:09:18.766,"You just magically show up like some knight in shining armor, ready to save the day."
00:09:18.808,00:09:21.478,"You know, I--I--I--I think you seem to be forgetting something here."
00:09:21.936,00:09:23.355,I'm in the crosshairs the same way you are.
00:09:31.363,00:09:33.156,You--you know something?
00:09:33.198,00:09:34.657,"You wanna go, you go."
00:09:51.591,00:09:53.593,"Mind if I lamp with you, Cuzzo?"
00:09:53.634,00:09:54.928,"Roll, snowflake."
00:09:56.012,00:09:57.638,"Hey, man, I'm just..."
00:09:57.680,00:09:59.516,"I'm just--just new, you know."
00:09:59.558,00:10:00.725,I'm looking for some homies.
00:10:00.767,00:10:02.977,"I said, roll."
00:10:04.354,00:10:05.813,"What? Uh, I'm just launching."
00:10:11.652,00:10:13.280,"All right, y'all."
00:10:13.947,00:10:16.157,I'm fitting to bounce.
00:10:17.700,00:10:19.077,Peace.
00:10:24.707,00:10:27.627,Boy's a bit confused about his pigmentation.
00:10:28.711,00:10:31.214,"But he sure does have spunk, doesn't he?"
00:10:38.138,00:10:39.639,Abruzzi!
00:10:40.640,00:10:41.558,Yeah?
00:10:41.600,00:10:42.642,What are you doing?
00:10:48.731,00:10:50.775,"First of the month's coming up, John."
00:10:50.817,00:10:53.403,Yeah? So?
00:10:53.445,00:10:54.654,I haven't got my monthly.
00:10:57.574,00:10:59.576,What?
00:10:59.618,00:11:00.743,It's looking seriously deficient.
00:11:01.911,00:11:03.913,Uh...
00:11:05.624,00:11:08.918,"It's gotta be some kind of a mistake, like an accounting error..."
00:11:08.960,00:11:12.797,Yeah.
00:11:12.839,00:11:16.134,I'm going back into my office at the end of the day.
00:11:17.010,00:11:18.428,Gonna check my balance again.
00:11:19.762,00:11:26.936,"If it's not up to where it's supposed to be, all these privileges you've got, like running PI, they're gone."
00:11:29.314,00:11:30.357,"Get it done, John."
00:11:32.150,00:11:34.693,Falzone Enterprises.
00:11:34.735,00:11:36.488,"I'm sorry, Mr. Falzone is not available."
00:11:36.530,00:11:37.989,You tell him it's John Abruzzi calling.
00:11:38.031,00:11:41.576,I'm sorry.
00:11:41.618,00:11:43.203,But now you do.
00:11:47.582,00:11:49.750,"I'm sorry, he's gonna have to call you back."
00:11:49.792,00:11:51.294,What? Hey...
00:12:04.432,00:12:07.143,I'm sorry about before.
00:12:09.812,00:12:11.648,"Pressure's getting to us, that's all."
00:12:12.815,00:12:14.275,Good news is nobody can reach us out here.
00:12:14.317,00:12:16.570,My old man made sure of that.
00:12:17.571,00:12:18.779,Never even hooked up a telephone.
00:12:18.821,00:12:20.574,Same with the well and the generator.
00:12:22.367,00:12:24.369,"You know, I used to think he was some kind of conspiracy theory wacko."
00:12:25.245,00:12:26.580,Turns out maybe he was right.
00:12:26.621,00:12:29.666,"I can't stay, Nick."
00:12:30.542,00:12:32.419,He's got less than two weeks.
00:12:33.752,00:12:36.256,The old man used to call this his serious tie.
00:12:36.297,00:12:40.385,"Only wore it when he really, really meant business."
00:12:43.888,00:12:46.266,"Be dangerous, you know, showing our faces again."
00:12:46.307,00:12:48.518,Not if they're not looking for us.
00:12:48.560,00:12:49.810,"They think we're dead, right?"
00:12:49.852,00:12:51.646,"I know, but how long is that gonna last?"
00:12:52.647,00:12:54.274,Gotta be quick.
00:12:54.315,00:12:59.738,"Way I see it, we're just gonna be running in circles if we think we're gonna find exculpatory evidence before the execution."
00:12:59.778,00:13:01.531,Proof he didn't do it.
00:13:01.573,00:13:04.367,I've gone up against pretty much every prosecutor in Cook County.
00:13:04.409,00:13:08.413,"Man gets murdered, the first person they wanna talk to to see who his real enemies were, the wife."
00:13:10.498,00:13:12.667,You wanna go after the queen bee herself?
00:13:12.709,00:13:13.501,Leslie Steadman.
00:13:14.502,00:13:18.339,Everyone in town knows the old bird lunches at the Lexington every day...
00:13:19.507,00:13:21.342,with the society set.
00:13:26.306,00:13:28.349,"Hey, hey!"
00:13:29.601,00:13:31.436,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, slow down. Slow down!"
00:13:32.646,00:13:34.855,"Man, your brother's gonna give us away."
00:13:38.526,00:13:40.487,Bull's coming.
00:13:40.528,00:13:43.990,ABRUZZI: Let's move.
00:13:47.410,00:13:49.370,All right.
00:13:49.412,00:13:51.038,Everybody out.
00:13:51.080,00:13:52.248,What?
00:13:52.290,00:13:54.626,"I said, everybody out. Now."
00:14:02.550,00:14:04.177,Move it.
00:14:06.763,00:14:07.972,Where are we going?
00:14:08.014,00:14:09.516,"Down there, around the corner."
00:14:09.557,00:14:13.520,And don't move a damn muscle till I come get you. Go.
00:14:14.813,00:14:16.815,What the hell's going on?
00:14:23.571,00:14:25.573,"We're so bad, aren't we?"
00:14:25.615,00:14:27.367,You're damn skippy. Let's go.
00:14:31.996,00:14:33.498,You gotta give us more of a warning next time.
00:14:41.297,00:14:42.298,"Oh, we're gonna get caught."
00:14:43.966,00:14:50.431,"PATTERSON: Baby, right now, in this room, at this moment, I am the warden."
00:14:50.473,00:14:52.350,Then say it.
00:14:52.392,00:14:55.353,"BECKY: No, I'm not gonna say it."
00:14:55.395,00:14:57.063,"Say it, Becky."
00:14:57.104,00:14:58.105,"You're the warden, Louis!"
00:14:58.147,00:15:00.066,"Yes, yes."
00:15:16.207,00:15:18.376,The sneaky son of a bitch.
00:15:19.293,00:15:21.588,You think he found the hole?
00:15:26.342,00:15:28.219,Another inch and he'd have found it.
00:15:28.261,00:15:30.805,We need to find something to cover this hole ASAP.
00:15:34.517,00:15:35.894,ABRUZZI: Broke?
00:15:38.563,00:15:41.566,The C-Corp.
00:15:41.608,00:15:43.735,Even the off-shore stuff.
00:15:43.777,00:15:45.528,"Caymans, Bermuda."
00:15:45.570,00:15:47.530,Philly Falzone liquidated everything.
00:15:47.572,00:15:51.158,"Hey, I told you from the beginning what would happen if he screwed me."
00:15:52.034,00:15:53.994,And I heeded it.
00:15:54.036,00:15:57.457,That's why I warned you from the get-go not to give Philly power of attorney.
00:15:57.498,00:15:58.958,"We had that conversation, remember?"
00:16:00.585,00:16:06.006,"Look, the only real funds you have left are the $30,000 in your wife's pocket account."
00:16:06.048,00:16:07.675,I can...
00:16:07.717,00:16:09.260,Don't touch that.
00:16:10.094,00:16:11.095,Nobody touches that but her.
00:16:12.096,00:16:13.556,What do I tell her?
00:16:13.598,00:16:14.682,"You know, about all this?"
00:16:14.724,00:16:17.101,"Don't tell her anything, okay?"
00:16:18.102,00:16:19.145,The statements are going to come.
00:16:20.480,00:16:21.439,She's going to know.
00:16:24.484,00:16:26.986,Don't tell her.
00:16:28.404,00:16:29.405,All right?
00:16:30.573,00:16:32.492,You got a problem with that?
00:16:37.997,00:16:39.958,You know where to contact me if you need anything else.
00:16:39.999,00:16:41.000,The same goes for you.
00:16:53.471,00:16:54.555,Hey.
00:16:55.348,00:16:56.683,Hey!
00:17:00.687,00:17:02.396,Philly.
00:17:04.231,00:17:06.066,So good to see you.
00:17:06.108,00:17:08.820,"FIORELLO: For you the answer's always yes, Philly."
00:17:08.862,00:17:10.237,Sit down.
00:17:13.574,00:17:14.701,Sit down.
00:17:14.742,00:17:16.243,"Come on, John."
00:17:21.749,00:17:27.755,"Uh, looks like there's no record of a Fox River medical practice on our list of participating HMOs or PBOs."
00:17:27.797,00:17:29.423,"Okay, that's because we're a state penitentiary."
00:17:33.135,00:17:36.806,Mr. Scofield's insurance policy from his previous employer hasn't lapsed yet.
00:17:37.891,00:17:41.936,"For that reason the state's demanding that you pay for his treatment, and not the taxpayers."
00:17:41.978,00:17:45.314,"WOMAN: Okay. Well, it says here he already met his deductible."
00:17:47.149,00:17:49.109,"Oh, no, wait."
00:17:49.151,00:17:52.030,"That's his psych deductible, not his medical."
00:17:52.071,00:17:54.156,Sorry.
00:18:01.789,00:18:03.875,I give you permission to call Philly?
00:18:04.751,00:18:06.293,"Hey, I asked you a question, man."
00:18:06.335,00:18:07.461,"Listen, there..."
00:18:09.171,00:18:10.882,There's been a restructuring.
00:18:10.924,00:18:12.508,This comes from Philly himself.
00:18:14.176,00:18:18.305,"You couldn't deliver Fibonacci, so I'm the man in here now."
00:18:19.139,00:18:20.433,"Hey, tell you what."
00:18:20.474,00:18:21.601,Run to the commissary and get me a bag of chips.
00:18:21.642,00:18:24.144,"We'll pretend this never happened, right?"
00:18:24.186,00:18:29.067,"Now, I'm telling you, John, the sooner you face these facts, the better off we will all be."
00:18:30.109,00:18:32.653,I can kill you in a heartbeat.
00:18:39.786,00:18:41.579,"The sooner you face facts, the better off we will all be."
00:18:47.418,00:18:49.629,"You're yesterday's news, John."
00:19:02.224,00:19:03.267,You all cooking brownies or what?
00:19:05.227,00:19:08.188,"Yo, what's the deal, yo?"
00:19:09.565,00:19:11.609,"You're a disgrace to your skin, you know that?"
00:19:13.235,00:19:14.528,The boy just slipped.
00:19:15.696,00:19:17.615,The boy just slipped.
00:19:17.657,00:19:19.700,Ain't that right?
00:19:21.911,00:19:23.579,"Come on, stand up."
00:19:23.621,00:19:26.457,"OFFICER: All right, fellas, let's get back to your cells."
00:19:26.499,00:19:29.376,"What's your name, boy?"
00:19:40.763,00:19:42.682,Who's that?
00:19:42.723,00:19:44.475,"Stolte, you heard about my kid, right?"
00:19:44.517,00:19:47.186,"Take the tray, Linc."
00:19:47.645,00:19:48.479,"I, uh..."
00:19:50.314,00:19:51.691,I just need to call him.
00:19:53.484,00:19:57.655,"Just take the tray, or I'm gonna shove it in there and you can eat it off the ground."
00:20:03.744,00:20:05.538,You have a son. Josh.
00:20:06.664,00:20:10.209,"Don't do anything stupid, Linc."
00:20:10.918,00:20:12.586,I'm not.
00:20:12.628,00:20:14.714,"I just wanna ask you a question, then I'm gonna let go."
00:20:18.634,00:20:19.844,What if it were Josh?
00:20:19.886,00:20:22.638,What if it were your son?
00:20:26.433,00:20:27.518,Please?
00:21:11.020,00:21:12.897,Dad?
00:21:12.939,00:21:15.233,"LJ, thank God."
00:21:16.275,00:21:17.651,No.
00:21:17.693,00:21:19.862,What do you mean?
00:21:21.363,00:21:22.907,"What they're saying about me, it's-- it's not true."
00:21:22.949,00:21:24.200,I know it's not true.
00:21:24.242,00:21:25.910,LJ: They killed her.
00:21:25.952,00:21:27.661,They killed her.
00:21:27.703,00:21:28.454,Right in front of me.
00:21:28.495,00:21:29.872,"Right in front of my eyes, Dad."
00:21:29.914,00:21:31.540,You gotta...
00:21:31.582,00:21:33.459,LINCOLN: Listen. Listen.
00:21:33.500,00:21:35.044,You gotta be the man now.
00:21:38.380,00:21:39.966,"Okay, I want you to call Veronica."
00:21:40.007,00:21:42.260,Her number is disconnected.
00:21:42.301,00:21:44.470,Nick Savrinn.
00:21:44.511,00:21:46.847,You call Nick Savrinn.
00:21:46.889,00:21:49.516,You call him once we're done.
00:21:50.350,00:21:52.103,Nick Savrinn. Okay.
00:21:52.145,00:21:53.312,"Okay, I'll call."
00:21:53.353,00:21:54.313,I'll call.
00:21:54.354,00:21:55.355,"All right, man."
00:21:56.816,00:21:58.317,"Hang in there, man."
00:22:00.903,00:22:02.196,They're here.
00:22:30.432,00:22:32.893,Move. Move!
00:23:13.475,00:23:15.686,You hear that?
00:23:17.479,00:23:19.773,KELLERMAN: Did you hear it?
00:23:20.482,00:23:22.568,You know what that means?
00:23:24.486,00:23:26.989,Why don't you ask your mom what it means?
00:23:27.489,00:23:29.449,"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:23:29.491,00:23:31.827,"You might have trouble getting an answer out of her right about now, huh?"
00:23:36.665,00:23:37.666,LJ?
00:24:19.541,00:24:20.500,I saw that.
00:24:20.542,00:24:22.836,"Just getting connected, that's all."
00:24:24.462,00:24:25.463,There she is.
00:24:27.549,00:24:29.427,NICK: Mrs. Steadman?
00:24:30.761,00:24:32.512,I'm Dick Sisler.
00:24:32.554,00:24:34.765,We're with the National Victim's Rights Association.
00:24:39.645,00:24:41.439,Bravo.
00:24:41.479,00:24:45.734,"Look, if your organization's looking for a handout, young man, you can go through my business manager."
00:24:45.776,00:24:48.737,"Ma'am, that's not why we're here, actually. May we sit down?"
00:24:48.779,00:24:53.117,We were hoping you could help us with one of our more public cases.
00:24:53.159,00:24:54.534,The Lincoln Burrows case.
00:24:54.576,00:24:56.703,"As you know, he's making unfounded claims that he's innocent."
00:24:56.745,00:24:59.539,That others had motive to murder your husband.
00:24:59.581,00:25:02.126,I really don't have time for a long conversation.
00:25:02.168,00:25:04.544,"Mrs. Steadman, it doesn't have to be a long conversation."
00:25:08.674,00:25:10.550,I'm sorry?
00:25:10.592,00:25:14.180,Half the people in this place were shareholders in his company.
00:25:14.221,00:25:19.143,Every one of them sat at my husband's memorial and every one of them was thinking the same thing.
00:25:19.185,00:25:21.228,Thank God he's gone.
00:25:21.270,00:25:22.355,Why would they think that?
00:25:27.609,00:25:30.112,I wasn't aware of any indictment.
00:25:30.154,00:25:32.365,It never came down.
00:25:34.616,00:25:38.245,"CEO of a corporation gets indicted for fraud, investors start losing money."
00:25:38.287,00:25:39.579,Lots of money.
00:25:39.621,00:25:43.709,"If I didn't know for sure Burrows pulled that trigger, I'd say it was any one of these people in this restaurant."
00:25:43.750,00:25:47.213,"We're talking half a billion dollars, Mr. Sisler."
00:25:48.214,00:25:49.756,People have killed for a lot less.
00:25:54.636,00:25:56.222,"Hey, what's up? What's up?"
00:26:10.652,00:26:14.614,"T-BAG: Not a good position you find yourself in, is it?"
00:26:16.658,00:26:18.785,"Whites don't want you, blacks don't want you."
00:26:20.246,00:26:22.081,"You're just caught in the middle, aren't you?"
00:26:23.290,00:26:25.167,A regular tweener.
00:26:27.294,00:26:29.838,"We're different, you and me, lot of ways."
00:26:29.880,00:26:34.051,"But, you know, the funny thing is, we're also a lot alike."
00:26:36.594,00:26:39.597,A couple of dogs with runny noses that nobody loves.
00:26:44.270,00:26:45.729,"How's that knee, by the way?"
00:26:45.771,00:26:47.898,What the hell you doing?
00:26:47.940,00:26:50.650,"No, no, no. No, don't-- don't get me wrong."
00:26:50.692,00:26:51.693,"Yeah, a fruity friend."
00:26:51.735,00:26:53.737,Easy now.
00:26:53.779,00:26:56.656,"No, you think you're getting up in this, you got another thing coming."
00:27:01.579,00:27:03.205,"You got a foul mouth, you know that?"
00:27:03.247,00:27:05.040,"Yeah, I do."
00:27:05.082,00:27:07.625,"And you come near me again, I'm gonna kill you."
00:27:22.057,00:27:23.809,"Bring it on, bitch."
00:27:23.850,00:27:25.811,I'm gonna bring it on in spades.
00:27:25.852,00:27:27.396,SCOFIELD: Maybe you ought to leave that kid alone.
00:27:27.438,00:27:30.732,And maybe you're in no position to be telling me my business.
00:27:31.150,00:27:32.192,Hmm?
00:27:39.450,00:27:42.744,BRIGHTON: I'm sure you can understand my reluctance to discuss past patients.
00:27:43.329,00:27:44.704,Absolutely.
00:27:44.746,00:27:50.794,"Uh, my understanding is that under HIPAA, we're allowed to share information as long as it furthers the care of the patient."
00:27:52.630,00:27:54.214,"I'm not accustomed to making inquiries like this, but I, uh..."
00:27:55.924,00:27:59.386,I feel like I can get through to him.
00:27:59.970,00:28:00.678,I can help him.
00:28:02.181,00:28:04.350,I imagine he needs it in there.
00:28:04.391,00:28:05.683,What did you treat him for?
00:28:06.935,00:28:09.229,"Well, Michael suffered from a couple of things."
00:28:09.271,00:28:12.149,One was a condition called low latent inhibition.
00:28:12.191,00:28:15.569,"I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with the term."
00:28:16.778,00:28:24.161,"Well, people who suffer from low latent inhibition see everyday things just like you or I do, like this lamp, for instance."
00:28:24.203,00:28:29.291,"But where we just process the image of a lamp, they process everything."
00:28:29.333,00:28:33.879,"The stem, the bulb, the bolts, even the washers inside."
00:28:33.920,00:28:39.759,BRIGHTON: Their brains are more open to incoming stimuli in the surrounding environment.
00:28:44.806,00:28:46.225,We have to do it in order to keep our sanity.
00:28:47.934,00:28:53.732,"If someone with a low IQ has low latent inhibition, it almost always results in mental illness."
00:28:54.774,00:29:00.197,"But if someone has a high IQ, it almost always results in creative genius."
00:29:03.158,00:29:05.744,Do you think Michael's a genius?
00:29:11.124,00:29:13.043,"But in the classic sense of the word, yes, I do."
00:29:16.255,00:29:19.174,You--you said there was something else you treated him for.
00:29:20.759,00:29:22.761,He came to me with absolutely no sense of self-worth.
00:29:24.346,00:29:27.140,The loss of both parents very often does that to a child.
00:29:27.182,00:29:31.729,"But with the low latent inhibition, something interesting happened to Michael."
00:29:33.146,00:29:35.733,He became very attuned to all the suffering around him.
00:29:36.816,00:29:38.110,He couldn't shut it out.
00:29:39.152,00:29:40.987,He became a rescuer.
00:29:41.029,00:29:45.033,One of those people who are more concerned with other people's welfare than their own.
00:29:50.122,00:29:52.207,Then maybe you don't know Michael Scofield.
00:29:54.126,00:29:55.127,Yeah.
00:30:28.744,00:31:15.874,"Are you ready? ' ' However you say, I don't care, I'm a-coming for you ' ' Are you there? ' ' Are you there? ' ' I'm a-coming, coming, coming for you ' ' I'm a-coming, I'm a-coming I'm a-coming, I'm a-coming '' I checked my voicemail at work."
00:31:17.626,00:31:19.919,Lincoln's son LJ just left me a message.
00:31:19.961,00:31:21.630,He's in trouble.
00:31:34.017,00:31:34.976,Hello?
00:31:35.018,00:31:36.854,"LJ, it's Veronica."
00:31:36.895,00:31:39.773,"Oh, Veronica, I don't know."
00:31:39.815,00:31:41.149,You gotta come get me.
00:31:41.191,00:31:42.942,"We can't, okay?"
00:31:42.984,00:31:44.069,You have to come to us.
00:31:44.110,00:31:47.072,"Oh. Well, all right."
00:31:47.989,00:31:50.950,Oh. Oh.
00:31:50.992,00:31:53.871,LJ: How the hell do they know where I am?
00:31:53.912,00:31:55.080,VERONICA: What's going on?
00:31:55.121,00:31:56.956,How the hell do they know where I am? God.
00:31:56.998,00:32:00.043,"LJ, LJ, I want you to listen to me."
00:32:01.754,00:32:03.088,"I want you to listen to me, okay?"
00:32:03.129,00:32:05.965,I need you to come to us.
00:32:06.007,00:32:07.384,Where's that?
00:32:07.426,00:32:09.052,It's on the Iowa border.
00:32:09.094,00:32:11.638,I want you to buy a ticket.
00:32:11.680,00:32:13.056,They're still alive.
00:32:13.098,00:32:15.308,Looks like a bird in hand just became three.
00:32:15.350,00:32:16.935,"Make sure you keep your cell phone on, okay?"
00:32:16.976,00:32:19.145,I need to be able to stay in contact with you.
00:32:19.187,00:32:20.980,But the kid's right...
00:32:21.022,00:32:21.981,LJ: Okay.
00:32:23.024,00:32:25.068,"Okay, I'll keep it on."
00:32:26.027,00:32:27.946,They're leaving.
00:32:27.987,00:32:29.072,"LJ, I need to know that you hear me, okay?"
00:32:29.114,00:32:31.283,Lake Mercer.
00:32:31.324,00:32:33.118,Lake Mercer. Okay.
00:32:33.159,00:32:35.621,"All right, bye."
00:33:05.191,00:33:08.069,What the hell are you doing?
00:33:10.322,00:33:12.991,Delivering yesterday's news.
00:33:25.128,00:33:28.548,Your bus leaves from Depot 6 in just a few minutes.
00:33:29.007,00:33:30.008,Thanks.
00:33:50.111,00:33:51.196,"Yo, man, get off me, bitch."
00:33:51.237,00:33:52.238,Let's pants him.
00:34:01.122,00:34:02.040,Wait a minute.
00:34:08.129,00:34:09.047,"SARA: I, uh..."
00:34:10.131,00:34:16.095,"just wanted you to know that if you're looking for someone to talk to in here, you're not alone."
00:34:16.137,00:34:20.099,It's part of my job to counsel inmates and help them with their problems.
00:34:20.141,00:34:22.561,I think I have things pretty well figured out.
00:34:24.688,00:34:26.064,I sort of backed into some information about you.
00:34:28.149,00:34:31.028,I hope you don't mind.
00:34:31.069,00:34:34.113,But you have to understand that there's a reason I became a doctor.
00:34:34.155,00:34:36.074,It's in my nature to want to help.
00:34:38.117,00:34:39.995,"From what I understand, it's in your nature, too."
00:34:41.997,00:34:44.249,You did a lot of good things before you were in here.
00:34:44.290,00:34:47.085,"A lot of community work, a lot of charity work."
00:34:47.502,00:34:49.462,What happened?
00:34:54.259,00:34:57.178,The man you're talking about died the moment I stepped inside these walls.
00:35:00.181,00:35:01.767,All right.
00:35:08.189,00:35:10.567,DISPATCHER: Shuttle now arriving at Platform 1.
00:35:41.974,00:35:45.143,"Ladies and gentlemen, United States Secret Service."
00:35:45.894,00:35:46.728,Please remain calm.
00:35:46.770,00:35:48.688,Remain where you are.
00:37:14.066,00:37:15.400,It's okay.
00:37:16.943,00:37:19.237,They're leaving.
00:37:33.334,00:37:35.420,"You're safe now, all right?"
00:37:56.024,00:37:57.275,You received communication from your attorney.
00:37:57.316,00:37:58.651,"LINCOLN: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:37:58.693,00:38:10.288,"Please sign this document certifying that I inspected the communication for contraband, without at any time breaching attorney-client privilege, reading the materials enclosed herein."
00:39:12.851,00:39:14.269,What are you grinning about?
00:39:14.311,00:39:18.315,"Ooh, just the fact that I'm gonna be out in the real world here in a little bit."
00:39:19.649,00:39:24.696,The fact that I'm gonna get me one fine piece of tail certainly don't hurt either.
00:39:43.464,00:39:46.092,"Oh, you just screwed some major league pooch, pretty."
00:39:46.134,00:39:48.970,I'm gonna sing like a whole tree-full of birds now.
00:39:49.012,00:39:50.055,Badge!
00:39:50.096,00:39:52.307,"You wanna sing, then sing."
00:39:53.308,00:39:55.060,But you know what I think?
00:39:55.227,00:39:58.437,You don't have the guts.
00:39:58.479,00:40:00.690,You want out of here just as much as the rest of us.
00:40:03.235,00:40:04.903,We got a problem here?
00:40:09.490,00:40:10.408,No.
00:40:12.035,00:40:13.078,"I, uh..."
00:40:15.080,00:40:20.126,"I--I thought we was, uh, missing some tools here."
00:40:27.092,00:40:33.348,"Now, you and I may be stuck together in this little dance, but I call the shots."
00:40:33.390,00:40:37.852,"First shot, that kid out there, you don't touch him, ever."
00:40:54.452,00:40:55.453,We do.
00:40:57.538,00:41:00.499,"Out of the way, Julio."
00:41:40.206,00:41:41.958,What?
00:41:42.834,00:41:43.793,I warned you.
00:41:44.585,00:41:46.045,I'll get it together.
00:41:46.087,00:41:47.672,You got to give me more time.
00:41:48.589,00:41:50.467,"You've had your time, John."
00:42:05.606,00:42:07.775,"You tripping on something, Alice?"
00:42:21.414,00:42:23.541,"Yeah, that's what I thought."
00:42:25.168,00:42:27.837,"Lamp it up in here again, I'll be fitting to break some shop."
00:42:35.470,00:42:36.346,SUCRE: Uh-oh.
00:42:36.388,00:42:37.472,We got a problem.
00:42:43.644,00:42:44.896,Bellick.
00:42:49.359,00:42:52.195,Boss. Boss. What's happening?
00:42:52.237,00:42:53.363,What they doing?
00:42:53.405,00:42:55.532,Fixing the break room.
00:42:55.573,00:42:57.242,What are you talking about?
00:42:57.283,00:42:59.952,That's PI. I run it.
00:43:02.830,00:43:04.832,Not anymore you don't.
00:00:01.502,00:00:06.131,MALE NARRATOR: Previously on Prison Break: It's the only building sitting on top of those tunnels.
00:00:06.173,00:00:10.218,All we gotta do is get in there on PI and dig ourselves an on-ramp.
00:00:20.103,00:00:23.190,"CEO of a corporation gets indicted for fraud, investors start losing money."
00:00:23.231,00:00:24.650,Lots of money.
00:00:30.113,00:00:32.115,LJ? LJ!
00:00:38.372,00:00:40.081,Yeah. So?
00:00:40.123,00:00:41.082,I checked my balance online.
00:00:41.124,00:00:42.334,It's looking seriously deficient.
00:00:42.376,00:00:46.213,Apparently Fibonacci's coming up for air again.
00:00:46.254,00:00:51.301,"And if he testifies at that hearing, a lot of people are going down, including me."
00:00:52.093,00:00:53.094,"Listen, there..."
00:00:53.136,00:00:55.222,There's been a restructuring.
00:00:55.263,00:00:56.473,This comes from Philly himself.
00:01:04.231,00:01:06.233,SCOFIELD: Uh-oh.
00:01:11.279,00:01:14.700,"Not anymore, you don't."
00:02:20.223,00:02:21.224,Bellick.
00:02:21.266,00:02:22.476,"Hey, boss."
00:02:22.517,00:02:24.728,"Check that volume, inmate."
00:02:25.854,00:02:27.230,We've been doing business too long.
00:02:27.272,00:02:29.149,"We can fix this thing, right?"
00:02:30.150,00:02:31.192,Let's get something clear.
00:02:33.236,00:02:34.780,Falzone's the one's been paying me.
00:02:34.822,00:02:36.197,Falzone is just an envelope.
00:02:36.239,00:02:38.659,You've been doing business with me face to face.
00:02:42.245,00:02:47.334,"These other chumps might do it for the $40,000 a year and the little blue uniform, but I'm not that dumb."
00:02:48.293,00:02:52.714,Falzone's envelope is the only reason I come through that fence every day.
00:02:52.756,00:02:59.554,And it's the only reason I'm gonna keep coming through that fence until I have enough money to buy that house on Lake Gray.
00:03:00.639,00:03:01.723,"I'm thinking early retirement, John."
00:03:04.225,00:03:09.188,"Hey, boss, just give me some time and I can match whatever Falzone is paying you."
00:03:12.651,00:03:13.777,"Hey, boss."
00:03:13.819,00:03:14.820,Boss!
00:03:35.716,00:03:36.758,They're gonna find it.
00:03:38.301,00:03:41.262,"The longer they're in there, the sooner they're gonna find it."
00:03:42.472,00:03:44.265,Yeah.
00:03:46.309,00:03:48.228,"Surprise, surprise."
00:03:51.106,00:03:52.900,"You're right, that is crazy."
00:03:52.941,00:03:55.903,"Because I got bigger things to think about, like survival."
00:04:03.451,00:04:07.288,"I need to get out right now, while I still got my life."
00:04:07.330,00:04:10.125,Then why are we talking about Fibonacci?
00:04:11.292,00:04:15.296,"Well, the only way I can get that room back is if I can prove to Falzone that I'm still worthy."
00:04:15.338,00:04:17.340,That I still got what it takes. Yeah?
00:04:17.382,00:04:21.095,And the only way I can do that is if I can give him Fibonacci.
00:04:22.345,00:04:24.014,Interesting.
00:04:24.056,00:04:28.018,"You see, this is not a me versus you thing anymore."
00:04:28.060,00:04:31.063,This is us.
00:04:31.105,00:04:33.314,It's us for the escape.
00:04:33.356,00:04:35.275,Is it?
00:04:35.316,00:04:38.070,Or is this about you getting back in good with the mob again?
00:04:38.112,00:04:39.362,"That life is over for me, Fish."
00:04:42.407,00:04:44.284,They want me to rot in here.
00:04:44.325,00:04:46.286,So I got no allegiance to them anymore.
00:04:46.327,00:04:48.247,And yet you still want to do them a favor.
00:04:52.126,00:04:53.961,Falzone is desperate.
00:04:54.002,00:05:01.260,"You see, if Fibonacci testifies in front of the Congress next month, Falzone is gonna go down in flames."
00:05:02.636,00:05:05.264,"But if we give him Fibonacci, he will give us anything."
00:05:06.389,00:05:08.308,"Anything, including that very special room."
00:05:11.436,00:05:13.438,"What do you say, Fish?"
00:05:17.985,00:05:29.454,"PRIEST: And the Lord said unto Satan, hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God and shuns evil?"
00:05:30.455,00:05:32.582,Give him up.
00:05:32.624,00:05:33.416,"If I do, they'll kill him."
00:05:33.458,00:05:35.002,Maybe he deserves it.
00:05:35.043,00:05:36.837,That's just it.
00:05:38.130,00:05:40.381,Who is this guy?
00:05:40.423,00:05:42.717,He was working for the Mafia.
00:05:43.468,00:05:46.263,Otto Fibonacci is...
00:05:46.847,00:05:47.472,He's just like you.
00:05:48.515,00:05:52.393,An innocent man caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.
00:05:53.687,00:05:56.190,MAN: What are you doing?
00:05:56.231,00:05:58.441,"You know, I didn't steal from you, John."
00:06:02.612,00:06:05.406,Just a normal guy.
00:06:08.451,00:06:10.411,"Hey, Nicky. Nicky, Nicky, Nicky."
00:06:12.831,00:06:15.083,What did I tell you about talking?
00:06:15.625,00:06:16.710,"MAN: John, please."
00:06:20.505,00:06:22.381,"Johnny, please, no!"
00:06:23.633,00:06:27.179,And somebody that couldn't turn his back on murder.
00:06:28.763,00:06:31.725,"He realized that Abruzzi and Falzone, the men he worked for, were killers."
00:06:36.479,00:06:37.564,And now he's in witness protection for life.
00:06:37.605,00:06:40.150,"Okay, all right."
00:06:40.192,00:06:42.610,The judge asked him why he was coming forward with all this information.
00:06:42.652,00:06:45.864,He said it was because he thought it was the right thing to do.
00:06:47.490,00:06:49.826,"What's the right thing to do now, Michael?"
00:06:49.868,00:06:51.286,I don't know.
00:06:52.495,00:06:55.707,"But if I don't give him up, this whole thing's over."
00:06:57.834,00:06:59.794,What you're telling me is if...
00:07:00.879,00:07:02.421,If I'm to live...
00:07:05.508,00:07:07.426,A good man has to die.
00:07:51.054,00:07:52.931,Kellerman.
00:07:52.973,00:07:54.515,VICE PRESIDENT: You're in the place we discussed?
00:07:54.557,00:07:56.017,Yes.
00:07:57.436,00:07:59.520,"I'm still not exactly sure why we're here, but..."
00:07:59.562,00:08:01.231,A friend of mine should be along there shortly.
00:08:01.273,00:08:02.523,A friend?
00:08:02.565,00:08:05.110,Just to see where you are with things.
00:08:05.152,00:08:07.154,I think we're clear on where we are with things.
00:08:07.195,00:08:09.030,Everything is under control.
00:08:09.072,00:08:12.159,Nothing is going to affect tomorrow if that's what you're worried about.
00:08:12.200,00:08:13.493,I'm not worried about tomorrow.
00:08:14.828,00:08:17.164,"My friend is a problem solver, that's all."
00:08:18.415,00:08:20.500,He's there at your disposal if you need him.
00:08:21.209,00:08:22.502,"Uh, do me a favor."
00:08:23.586,00:08:25.588,"Make him feel like part of the team, huh?"
00:08:26.589,00:08:27.507,Talk soon.
00:08:30.093,00:08:33.513,HALE: What?
00:08:34.097,00:08:35.140,What does that mean?
00:08:35.182,00:08:36.308,Something in her tone changed.
00:08:36.350,00:08:38.143,Do you think she knows about the kid?
00:08:39.602,00:08:40.520,We don't know that.
00:08:41.355,00:08:43.564,We shouldn't have lied.
00:08:43.606,00:08:44.983,We shouldn't have told her we had the kid.
00:08:46.776,00:08:49.570,"We tell her that kid got away, you and I, we are not here right now."
00:08:49.612,00:08:53.408,"I swear to God, it just gets deeper and deeper."
00:08:53.450,00:08:54.575,What is that supposed to mean?
00:08:54.617,00:09:00.207,"It means, if I'd have known that this is how this whole thing was gonna turn out I'd have gotten some crap job with the Feds."
00:09:00.248,00:09:04.544,Drink coffee all day long behind a desk.
00:09:06.629,00:09:08.673,"Keep talking like that, I'm gonna be forced to put a bullet in your head."
00:09:13.636,00:09:21.561,"As for her friend, whoever that is, we find out what he wants, we play nice, we deal with it accordingly."
00:09:24.481,00:09:27.234,"Michael, you better see this."
00:09:33.865,00:09:36.576,"Hey, Jersey, you putting that carpet in the guards' room?"
00:09:37.660,00:09:38.953,"Yeah, I think so."
00:09:39.662,00:09:40.621,When?
00:09:40.663,00:09:42.582,We got to tear up the old stuff first.
00:09:43.542,00:09:44.918,Soon as we're done with that.
00:09:44.959,00:09:46.586,"Tonight, tomorrow maybe."
00:09:46.627,00:09:50.424,"They're gonna find it, bro."
00:09:51.425,00:09:52.592,We got to do something.
00:10:05.397,00:10:06.606,Linc. Chow.
00:10:12.653,00:10:14.030,LINCOLN: What's this?
00:10:14.072,00:10:17.492,"It's for, uh, you know, your last meal."
00:10:17.534,00:10:19.911,Write down what you want.
00:10:26.667,00:10:29.629,"Linc, you got to write something down."
00:10:30.630,00:10:32.257,I got to do nothing.
00:10:36.386,00:10:41.349,You don't fill it out all they're gonna give you is what's on chow for that day.
00:10:41.391,00:10:42.850,So?
00:10:45.645,00:10:46.646,Hmm?
00:10:55.405,00:10:56.823,In case you think of something.
00:11:14.174,00:11:15.634,"Hey, eye-tie."
00:11:19.846,00:11:22.390,"Something you need there, uh, rughead?"
00:11:23.766,00:11:24.892,"Yeah. A job, man."
00:11:26.561,00:11:29.147,Why don't you hit the DQ down the street?
00:11:30.315,00:11:32.233,I'll put $100 in your kick every month.
00:11:34.402,00:11:36.695,You want to pay me to work?
00:11:38.781,00:11:41.868,"I scrub one more tray, I'm gonna go J-cat, you know what I'm saying?"
00:11:41.909,00:11:43.370,"Hey, Fiorello."
00:11:46.747,00:11:47.748,$150.
00:11:50.418,00:11:51.710,"Sign me up then, baby."
00:12:10.647,00:12:11.772,That's right.
00:12:13.941,00:12:15.694,As far as I have to.
00:12:15.734,00:12:17.736,Then set up a meeting with Falzone.
00:12:18.821,00:12:19.780,I want to talk to him directly.
00:12:22.534,00:12:25.161,Falzone doesn't talk to guys like you directly.
00:12:26.413,00:12:28.415,"If he wants Fibonacci, he's gonna have to."
00:12:34.128,00:12:35.338,"ABRUZZI: No, no."
00:12:35.963,00:12:37.674,"No, you heard me right."
00:12:37.716,00:12:39.467,FALZONE: You're telling me this kid is gonna give up Fibonacci?
00:12:40.594,00:12:42.554,I'm definite.
00:12:40.594,00:12:44.514,"Only one thing, he wants to meet with you directly."
00:12:44.556,00:12:46.391,"Son of a bitch, son of a bitch."
00:12:46.433,00:12:48.309,"You actually did something right, John."
00:12:49.852,00:12:52.522,Guess I'll have to call off those guys I hired to shank you.
00:12:55.858,00:12:56.775,Funny.
00:12:57.944,00:12:59.070,Good. I'll come out there this afternoon.
00:13:06.286,00:13:08.829,I hope you understand that.
00:13:08.871,00:13:10.081,"I love you, too."
00:13:16.713,00:13:18.089,He's coming.
00:13:19.882,00:13:21.384,Don't mess this up.
00:13:51.498,00:13:52.831,Hello.
00:13:54.375,00:13:55.460,I know.
00:13:57.003,00:14:00.340,Remember when I said I might be calling you on Fibonacci?
00:14:00.757,00:14:01.549,Yes.
00:14:02.091,00:14:04.636,"Well, it's time."
00:14:06.554,00:14:07.430,You seem distracted.
00:14:08.473,00:14:10.224,"I've got a lot on my mind, I guess."
00:14:10.266,00:14:11.892,Yeah?
00:14:11.934,00:14:15.271,Have anything to do with the people who took these toes?
00:14:15.938,00:14:16.731,Nice flowers.
00:14:18.983,00:14:20.234,Do we have an admirer?
00:14:20.276,00:14:21.319,They're from my father.
00:14:23.530,00:14:25.532,What's the occasion?
00:14:25.573,00:14:26.658,It's my birthday.
00:14:26.700,00:14:27.908,Today?
00:14:29.744,00:14:30.745,Happy birthday.
00:14:32.955,00:14:34.374,Okay.
00:14:38.545,00:14:39.920,Nothing.
00:14:39.962,00:14:43.424,"Birthdays aren't usually a sore subject, that's all."
00:14:44.592,00:14:49.556,"Unless the celebrant is feeling her age, which I don't see how you could be."
00:14:50.973,00:14:53.393,"I'm 29 years old, Michael."
00:14:54.686,00:15:00.525,"It's just that out of those 29 birthdays, my father's actually managed to see me on precisely six of them."
00:15:00.567,00:15:04.571,"So, I get flowers instead."
00:15:05.988,00:15:07.490,Flowers that end up dead and in the trash a week later.
00:15:09.992,00:15:11.619,"That sounded bitter, huh?"
00:15:12.579,00:15:13.954,Kind of.
00:15:13.996,00:15:15.456,It's not a big deal.
00:15:15.498,00:15:17.333,You are all set.
00:15:17.375,00:15:18.668,Okay.
00:15:21.880,00:15:23.381,I'm sorry you feel that way.
00:15:24.591,00:15:27.552,"About the flowers, I mean."
00:15:34.392,00:15:37.144,"Hey, somebody get on this."
00:15:37.186,00:15:38.354,"I got it, boss."
00:15:38.396,00:15:40.565,"Hey, chill, lilywhite, I got it."
00:16:03.963,00:16:06.674,Come on.
00:16:38.247,00:16:40.040,"NICK: He's not doing well, is he?"
00:16:40.082,00:16:42.293,He just lost his mother.
00:16:43.461,00:16:44.671,Ten days from now he loses his father.
00:16:54.555,00:16:56.223,NICK: How you holding up?
00:17:00.770,00:17:02.480,"You know, I, uh..."
00:17:09.111,00:17:11.948,"No disrespect, but I don't know that you do."
00:17:12.991,00:17:14.033,"No, with, uh, with my dad."
00:17:15.743,00:17:18.663,I was in the same spot when I was your age.
00:17:19.163,00:17:20.665,He was in prison.
00:17:21.666,00:17:23.751,"And like your dad, he was innocent."
00:17:25.127,00:17:27.964,What happened?
00:17:29.131,00:17:31.467,What I hope happens here.
00:17:35.054,00:17:36.430,A lot of bad things.
00:17:37.557,00:17:40.476,They weren't true and we proved that.
00:17:41.728,00:17:46.148,"Every day, every day was a lost cause, but we kept fighting."
00:17:46.190,00:17:48.192,"I mean, what else you gonna do when you love somebody?"
00:17:48.234,00:17:51.111,You gonna let them go out like that?
00:17:51.153,00:17:52.530,So you fight.
00:17:52.572,00:17:55.533,You keep fighting.
00:17:59.537,00:18:02.540,"We're gonna beat this thing, okay?"
00:18:11.716,00:18:12.466,Hello.
00:18:12.508,00:18:14.719,Hello.
00:18:14.761,00:18:17.137,You were-- You were expecting me?
00:18:17.179,00:18:18.180,Yes.
00:18:18.222,00:18:19.724,You...
00:18:21.768,00:18:23.143,Hey. How are...
00:18:28.691,00:18:30.068,KELLERMAN: I'm sorry I didn't get your name.
00:18:30.109,00:18:31.110,Quinn.
00:18:32.486,00:18:34.697,"Mr. Quinn, mind telling us what we're doing here?"
00:18:36.490,00:18:39.660,"Well, you can probably tell just by looking at me I--I'm not a wave-making sort."
00:18:39.702,00:18:46.918,"Just think of me as a supervisor who's here to make sure things are under control as we approach, you know, the big event."
00:18:46.960,00:18:48.836,I wasn't aware that things are out of control.
00:18:48.878,00:18:51.714,"Well, you would be the one that would know, wouldn't you?"
00:18:56.886,00:19:04.393,"Well, the reason I'm here is because there's a discrepancy between what you know and what you have said to the Vice President."
00:19:04.435,00:19:08.689,"The lawyers you tried to blow up, they're still running around healthy as thoroughbreds."
00:19:08.731,00:19:10.483,"You know it, I know it."
00:19:12.860,00:19:17.698,"You know, who you were silly enough to tell the old lady that you were actually in possession of."
00:19:17.740,00:19:20.618,Now everything that I'm saying is boiling down to this.
00:19:20.660,00:19:25.706,You got to hand the reins over to me now so that I can save your ass.
00:19:31.420,00:19:32.588,First of all...
00:19:34.715,00:19:35.758,"No, no!"
00:19:36.759,00:19:38.511,"See, now you made me make a wave."
00:19:41.430,00:19:44.642,You and your partner are off the job until further notice.
00:19:44.684,00:19:46.769,It doesn't come from me.
00:19:46.811,00:19:48.813,It comes from the Company.
00:20:00.158,00:20:02.910,"Look, your..."
00:20:05.287,00:20:06.580,That's what a doctor would tell you to do.
00:20:06.622,00:20:08.708,So you don't need to go see one.
00:20:28.019,00:20:30.021,Ecofield's SEC filings.
00:20:30.063,00:20:34.192,"Terrence Steadman was murdered so the information from his indictment wouldn't be made public, right?"
00:20:38.320,00:20:42.658,Steadman's wife said there were hundreds of millions of dollars at stake if her husband went down.
00:20:42.700,00:20:45.995,So I figure we follow the money and see where it takes us.
00:20:46.037,00:20:48.831,$109 million.
00:20:48.873,00:20:55.213,Over half a billion dollars that I've found so far in federal grants to Ecofield for alternative fuel research.
00:20:55.254,00:20:56.214,That is a hell of a lot of money.
00:20:56.255,00:20:57.381,But for what?
00:20:57.423,00:21:01.635,"Not only did the company never make a profit, a-as far as I could tell, they never made anything."
00:21:01.677,00:21:06.057,"Look. No fuel cells, no patents, no findings."
00:21:06.099,00:21:08.559,"So Ecofield was a sham, it was a cover."
00:21:08.601,00:21:10.269,"Question is, for what?"
00:21:23.241,00:21:24.450,Philly.
00:21:35.419,00:21:36.462,So.
00:21:37.379,00:21:38.714,Fibonacci.
00:21:39.381,00:21:40.424,How'd you find him?
00:21:40.466,00:21:41.884,Did my homework.
00:21:45.054,00:21:49.642,"You get elliptical with me for one more second, and I will cancel you."
00:21:50.392,00:21:51.685,You understand me?
00:21:51.727,00:21:52.728,"Give it up, Fish."
00:21:55.355,00:22:05.407,"Before someone's transferred to the US Marshals Service and placed in witness protection, they're guarded by a local sheriff from the county where the trial will take place."
00:22:08.452,00:22:10.037,"Sheriff Solomon, please."
00:22:10.079,00:22:11.330,OPERATOR: Please hold.
00:22:12.999,00:22:14.000,Andrew Solomon here.
00:22:18.921,00:22:23.092,"SCOFIELD: If the sheriff was available, then he wasn't the one guarding Fibonacci."
00:22:23.134,00:22:24.885,RECEPTIONIST: Putnam County Sheriff's Office.
00:22:24.927,00:22:27.721,"Yeah, is, uh, Sheriff Pronzo there?"
00:22:27.763,00:22:30.390,"I'm sorry, Sheriff Pronzo's on vacation."
00:22:30.432,00:22:31.725,Really?
00:22:31.767,00:22:32.810,"Yes, sir."
00:22:32.852,00:22:34.645,There were only four sheriffs in the county.
00:22:36.314,00:22:43.946,"And since Pronzo was the only one who wasn't in his office, and his wife and kids were waiting for him at home, I knew the only vacation he was taking was with Fibonacci."
00:22:43.988,00:22:46.364,Watching him until they could put him in protection.
00:22:46.406,00:22:51.620,"Thing is, sometimes it takes weeks for the Marshals Service to set up a new identity."
00:22:51.662,00:22:55.958,So some local sheriff is stuck in the middle of nowhere with Fibonacci.
00:22:56.000,00:22:58.460,He gets lonely and calls home.
00:22:58.502,00:23:00.129,A lot.
00:23:02.548,00:23:06.010,I called the phone company.
00:23:07.553,00:23:09.805,I asked for another copy.
00:23:11.640,00:23:16.645,It seems Mrs. Pronzo was receiving dozens of calls from an area code a long way from Chicago.
00:23:18.231,00:23:21.650,"I went online, reverse-traced the number, and voila."
00:23:22.776,00:23:24.402,There was Fibonacci's exact location.
00:23:26.113,00:23:27.240,How do you know he's still there?
00:23:27.281,00:23:29.742,I have someone looking after him.
00:23:29.783,00:23:31.911,"Watching from afar, in case he moves."
00:23:31.952,00:23:32.995,Mmm-hmm.
00:23:36.790,00:23:37.750,"This is about money, isn't it?"
00:23:37.791,00:23:40.169,"You're an astute man, Mr. Falzone."
00:23:40.211,00:23:41.419,What?
00:23:41.461,00:23:44.464,"Your friend here, John, is trying to extort me."
00:23:44.506,00:23:46.550,Not extortion. Insurance.
00:23:47.593,00:23:48.677,I plan on being out of here one day.
00:23:48.719,00:23:51.931,And I don't think my new resume is going to cut it in most places.
00:23:51.972,00:23:54.058,How much?
00:23:54.100,00:23:55.433,"$200,000."
00:23:56.810,00:23:57.937,I'm gonna kill you.
00:23:57.978,00:23:59.437,Quid pro quo.
00:24:00.564,00:24:02.524,"You scratch my back, I scratch yours."
00:24:02.566,00:24:05.236,"Well, I'll give you some quid pro quo."
00:24:08.948,00:24:10.657,Where did you get this?
00:24:13.619,00:24:15.162,Who took this picture?
00:24:15.204,00:24:22.502,"Well, since you took it upon yourself to have some people watching over our interests on the outside, we took it upon ourselves to have some people watching over yours."
00:24:22.544,00:24:24.838,So who's it gonna be?
00:24:24.880,00:24:28.634,Fibonacci or your pretty little girlfriend there?
00:24:43.565,00:24:48.028,"Yeah, you should be careful with who visits you in here, Fish."
00:24:48.070,00:24:49.029,These walls have eyes.
00:24:50.239,00:24:54.160,"If you touch her, I'll kill you myself."
00:24:54.994,00:24:57.955,One: That is an empty threat.
00:24:57.997,00:25:00.124,You are less than a gnat to me.
00:25:00.166,00:25:06.005,"And two: All you gotta do is give me the address, and we avoid all this melodrama altogether."
00:25:11.469,00:25:13.511,"The address, you gnat."
00:25:14.013,00:25:14.847,Now.
00:25:19.810,00:25:21.187,Promise me...
00:25:23.230,00:25:25.983,Promise me it'll be quick and painless.
00:25:27.609,00:25:28.777,Promise me.
00:25:50.383,00:25:51.549,Canada.
00:25:53.844,00:26:00.100,"345 Hamilton Avenue, Thunder Bay, Ontario."
00:26:00.142,00:26:01.559,Get out of here.
00:26:17.201,00:26:19.745,"Nice work, John."
00:26:21.830,00:26:25.792,I guess the demise of John Abruzzi was greatly exaggerated.
00:26:27.585,00:26:29.587,Thank you.
00:26:31.006,00:26:33.591,Could you do me a favor and fix this Bellick thing for me?
00:26:34.218,00:26:35.928,"Yeah, consider it done."
00:26:37.263,00:26:39.181,Thank you.
00:26:39.223,00:26:47.981,"And Philly, before you pull the trigger, look the son of a bitch in his eyes and tell him John Abruzzi said goodbye."
00:27:19.721,00:27:23.392,"VICE PRESIDENT: In the race toward worldwide peace and prosperity, America will set the pace."
00:27:24.726,00:27:27.687,"Race? Rat race, arms race."
00:27:27.729,00:27:30.690,Can you think of a word with a worse connotation?
00:27:30.732,00:27:31.525,Fix it.
00:27:33.444,00:27:35.571,You send me a babysitter?
00:27:36.738,00:27:38.616,This is not the time or the place.
00:27:38.656,00:27:41.076,This is the time and the place.
00:27:41.118,00:27:42.578,Don't take that tone with me.
00:27:43.745,00:27:46.540,I am the Vice President of this country.
00:27:46.582,00:27:50.586,"No, actually, you're Caroline Reynolds from Montgomery, Illinois."
00:27:51.420,00:27:52.630,I know exactly who you are.
00:27:55.757,00:27:57.593,Come with me.
00:28:05.100,00:28:07.936,There is something you need to understand.
00:28:07.978,00:28:12.107,"If you had done your job, I never would have had to ask for Quinn."
00:28:12.149,00:28:14.734,And there's something you need to understand.
00:28:14.776,00:28:17.571,You woke a sleeping beast when you called these guys in.
00:28:17.613,00:28:23.327,They have a bigger agenda than any of us and they get real nasty real quick if things don't go their way.
00:28:23.369,00:28:24.578,"So now, no one is safe."
00:28:24.620,00:28:27.789,Not you. Not me.
00:28:28.790,00:28:31.126,Let's not overreact.
00:28:31.168,00:28:34.129,"I mean, I know everyone is nervous about tomorrow."
00:28:34.171,00:28:35.922,I understand that.
00:28:35.964,00:28:41.595,"But the one thing both of us have to remember is that we are in this together, okay?"
00:28:42.971,00:28:46.766,"All I'm saying is, these guys are into this thing now, and there's no going back."
00:29:03.825,00:29:06.370,Sebastian Balfour?
00:29:06.828,00:29:08.788,Yeah.
00:29:08.830,00:29:12.543,"Yeah, I'm Nestor Pollock, Midwestern Life and Casualty."
00:29:14.836,00:29:17.839,"Oh, no, I'm here to discuss Veronica Donovan."
00:29:17.881,00:29:19.925,What about her?
00:29:19.966,00:29:24.680,"Well, we've been trying to track her down with respect to the property damage from the apartment explosion."
00:29:24.722,00:29:25.764,Explosion?
00:29:25.805,00:29:29.518,You didn't know?
00:29:31.103,00:29:33.146,"It's-- It's just that her records, they list you as her fiance, so I assumed..."
00:29:33.188,00:29:34.189,Hold on.
00:29:34.231,00:29:35.148,Is Veronica okay?
00:29:35.190,00:29:37.192,"Well, there has been a fatality."
00:29:37.234,00:29:38.569,"Oh, my God."
00:29:38.611,00:29:43.073,"No, but the medical examiners haven't been able to identify the remains with any certainty."
00:29:43.115,00:29:45.825,So Veronica could be okay.
00:29:45.867,00:29:47.536,We were hoping you could help.
00:30:18.150,00:30:19.109,Rozz.
00:30:26.116,00:30:27.409,Burrows.
00:30:38.504,00:30:40.255,"Blueberry pancakes, huh?"
00:30:40.297,00:30:44.426,"All right, man. You got it."
00:32:22.608,00:32:24.359,FALZONE: 341.
00:32:31.283,00:32:32.951,345.
00:32:38.039,00:32:39.499,This is it.
00:32:41.376,00:32:43.962,"All right. That's it, kids."
00:32:47.048,00:32:50.093,"You okay down there, boy?"
00:32:52.888,00:32:55.390,"All right, sweetheart, give me a kiss."
00:33:11.239,00:33:12.240,Kids are down.
00:33:12.282,00:33:13.325,Thanks.
00:33:17.078,00:33:19.456,"Tonight we send a message, gentlemen."
00:33:19.498,00:33:22.083,We are gonna hurt him and his family the way he hurt ours.
00:33:48.318,00:33:50.278,"WOMAN: Oh, honey."
00:33:50.320,00:33:54.240,"Oh, can you change the timer on the sprinkler while you're out there?"
00:33:54.282,00:33:55.200,Okay.
00:33:55.241,00:33:56.952,Love you.
00:34:01.707,00:34:03.709,OFFICER 1: Freeze!
00:34:03.750,00:34:05.377,OFFICER 2: Drop your weapons!
00:34:05.418,00:34:06.586,Put it down!
00:34:06.628,00:34:08.087,Down! Down!
00:34:09.130,00:34:10.716,I said drop it!
00:34:16.555,00:34:17.806,Down!
00:34:17.848,00:34:19.474,Son of a bitch.
00:34:21.434,00:34:22.686,Come on.
00:34:44.499,00:34:47.210,"Hi, it's John."
00:34:47.252,00:34:48.587,MAGGIO: Yeah.
00:34:48.628,00:34:52.674,Falzone got popped last night up in Canada.
00:34:52.716,00:34:56.595,"International gun charges, parole violation."
00:34:56.636,00:34:58.638,He's in deep.
00:35:05.437,00:35:07.773,"Yeah, like I said, they don't last."
00:35:09.232,00:35:11.068,I don't think they're dead yet.
00:35:13.486,00:35:15.822,I don't like getting attached to things if I know they won't last.
00:35:17.866,00:35:19.200,Here you go.
00:35:20.077,00:35:21.620,Why are you so cynical?
00:35:23.204,00:35:24.706,"Michael, I think there's cynicism and then there's realism."
00:35:24.748,00:35:28.585,And there's optimism.
00:35:28.627,00:35:31.713,This coming from an eight-toed guy locked away in a penitentiary.
00:35:32.297,00:35:33.632,Toes are overrated.
00:35:35.133,00:35:38.011,Thank you for trying to make me smile.
00:35:38.053,00:35:39.429,You never know.
00:35:39.471,00:35:40.847,We're all set.
00:36:11.837,00:36:14.631,"You and I have a lot to talk about, don't we, Fish?"
00:36:14.673,00:36:21.888,Seems Philly Falzone ran into some problem up in Canada just because of the information you gave him.
00:36:21.930,00:36:23.431,What kind of trouble?
00:36:23.473,00:36:26.225,"International gun charges, parole violation."
00:36:27.310,00:36:29.354,He's going to go away for a long time.
00:36:29.395,00:36:31.606,How do you feel about that?
00:36:32.607,00:36:33.942,Pretty darn good.
00:36:37.821,00:36:39.656,And what about PI?
00:36:39.698,00:36:40.740,"We got that back, too."
00:36:41.700,00:36:43.618,Falzone paid Bellick yesterday.
00:36:43.660,00:36:45.037,"So we're good, for now."
00:36:45.078,00:36:46.204,It all worked out.
00:36:46.245,00:36:47.246,It sure did.
00:36:47.288,00:36:49.041,Nicely done.
00:36:49.082,00:36:50.750,Thank you.
00:36:52.044,00:36:55.714,"Well, this helped."
00:36:56.297,00:36:57.799,Where'd you take it?
00:36:58.925,00:37:00.844,"It's Lincoln's, from back in the day."
00:37:00.886,00:37:02.637,Camping trip or something.
00:37:02.679,00:37:04.097,So when do we get back in that room?
00:37:04.848,00:37:05.974,Right away.
00:37:06.016,00:37:07.266,"Well, let's get to it."
00:37:09.936,00:37:12.230,"Oh, there's one more thing."
00:37:14.816,00:37:20.030,"You are gonna give me Fibonacci once we're outside these walls, right?"
00:37:20.072,00:37:22.157,Of course.
00:37:26.411,00:37:27.871,Thank you.
00:37:27.913,00:37:32.667,But I think I'll keep this as insurance.
00:37:48.600,00:37:49.768,LINCOLN: More juice?
00:37:49.809,00:37:51.978,Why can't we have breakfast every day?
00:37:52.020,00:37:55.732,"You should have breakfast every day, LJ."
00:37:55.774,00:37:58.985,"No, why can't I have breakfast with you every day?"
00:37:59.027,00:38:00.820,Nothing would make me happier.
00:38:00.862,00:38:04.282,"But your mommy and me, we don't live together anymore."
00:38:05.617,00:38:07.160,Why?
00:38:08.453,00:38:11.790,"Well, um, sometimes that happens with mommies and daddies."
00:38:14.626,00:38:17.963,But you know what?
00:38:14.626,00:38:21.841,"You're the luckiest boy in the world, 'cause your mommy loves you very much and I love you very much."
00:38:22.592,00:38:24.010,I'll tell you what.
00:38:28.640,00:38:30.225,Yeah?
00:38:30.267,00:38:31.350,"Little bit, or a handful?"
00:38:31.392,00:38:32.393,Handful.
00:38:32.435,00:38:33.853,A handful.
00:38:35.772,00:38:37.356,Here we go.
00:38:48.409,00:38:50.620,Take a walk.
00:38:56.334,00:38:58.336,Anyone else want to walk with him?
00:39:00.588,00:39:01.631,Yeah.
00:39:05.260,00:39:06.761,This is my game.
00:39:06.803,00:39:09.388,Looks like our friend got his throne back.
00:39:09.430,00:39:10.473,SCOFIELD: Looks like it.
00:39:12.058,00:39:15.645,Something tells me we may have you to thank for that.
00:39:16.479,00:39:17.730,You don't want to know.
00:39:17.772,00:39:18.815,You got that right.
00:39:18.857,00:39:21.318,"Stretch your legs, old head."
00:39:31.452,00:39:34.580,"Now, we got a hell of a lot to talk about, don't we?"
00:39:41.254,00:39:42.839,I got nothing to say.
00:39:48.469,00:39:51.389,"Big school learning, huh?"
00:39:52.431,00:39:54.392,Darwin wins inside these walls.
00:39:55.018,00:39:57.312,Not Einstein. Darwin.
00:39:58.104,00:39:59.981,"Yard time's over, ladies."
00:40:00.023,00:40:01.566,Let's line it up.
00:40:03.776,00:40:05.695,"I'm not done with you, Fish."
00:40:06.571,00:40:08.698,You never even got started.
00:40:27.259,00:40:28.551,All right.
00:40:33.056,00:40:34.599,We're through the hard part.
00:40:34.640,00:40:37.269,"Another 18 inches, we'll hit that pipe."
00:40:38.019,00:40:39.271,We'll be there by Friday.
00:40:39.312,00:40:40.479,Friday?
00:40:44.525,00:40:45.985,"ABRUZZI: Sardinia, here I come."
00:40:46.778,00:40:47.737,Where are we going?
00:40:47.779,00:40:48.529,Panama.
00:40:48.571,00:40:49.614,Panama?
00:40:51.157,00:40:53.576,"Darien Gap, south of the Canal."
00:40:53.618,00:40:56.037,"No roads, no electricity, no cops."
00:40:57.455,00:41:00.541,Nothing but white sand beaches and ice cold beer.
00:41:03.544,00:41:05.880,"Well, we'll open a scuba shop."
00:41:06.547,00:41:07.506,"Hey, I don't dive."
00:41:07.548,00:41:08.633,Neither do I.
00:41:08.674,00:41:10.635,We'll have plenty of time to learn.
00:41:12.011,00:41:13.263,Bulls.
00:41:19.560,00:41:21.938,This con says he's on the job in here.
00:41:23.148,00:41:24.023,"No, I don't think so."
00:41:24.065,00:41:25.775,You heard the piasan.
00:41:35.576,00:41:37.829,"Now, you're sure about that?"
00:41:37.870,00:41:40.581,Are you sure you can't use an extra hand?
00:41:40.623,00:41:42.834,You know anything about construction?
00:41:42.875,00:41:45.003,Concrete is my specialty.
00:41:49.966,00:41:52.135,"Okay, boss."
00:41:52.177,00:41:53.511,You got it.
00:42:02.770,00:42:05.023,"It looks like Darwin wins after all, eh, Fish?"
00:42:13.948,00:42:16.159,We have a lot of dots but no way to connect them.
00:42:17.618,00:42:19.204,Nobody's getting rich here.
00:42:19.245,00:42:20.746,What about shareholders?
00:42:20.788,00:42:23.166,"Profits were minimal, they were all converted back to shares."
00:42:23.208,00:42:28.129,"Looks like they subcontracted out some research and development, but it's pennies in the grand scheme of things."
00:42:28.171,00:42:30.215,Nobody was pulling early retirement.
00:42:30.256,00:42:33.592,"Yeah, but you can't hide $500 million just by moving a few decimal points."
00:42:33.634,00:42:39.182,"REPORTER: In a move anticipated by many pundits, Vice President Reynolds announced she is running for the Presidency."
00:42:39.224,00:42:42.768,"She made the announcement from her hometown of Montgomery, Illinois."
00:42:42.810,00:42:48.691,"The move toward worldwide peace and prosperity is a marathon, not a sprint."
00:42:48.733,00:42:52.070,But I assure you America will be setting the pace.
00:42:53.405,00:42:55.614,A half a billion dollars just doesn't disappear.
00:42:55.656,00:42:57.909,You--You could run a small country with that.
00:42:57.950,00:43:02.080,The Vice President is reported to have the largest campaign war chest in history.
00:43:02.121,00:43:08.169,"It is so large, in fact, that prognosticators are already casting her as the favorite in the Presidential race."
00:43:08.211,00:43:10.004,Maybe not a small country.
00:43:11.214,00:43:12.590,Maybe this one.
00:00:01.794,00:00:05.213,MALE NARRATOR: Previously on Prison Break: We're through the hard part.
00:00:05.255,00:00:07.215,"Another 18 inches, we'll hit that pipe."
00:00:13.096,00:00:16.016,"Now, we got a hell of a lot to talk about, don't we?"
00:00:22.314,00:00:24.316,"Okay, boss."
00:00:24.358,00:00:27.319,"T-BAG: Whites don't want you, blacks don't want you."
00:00:31.365,00:00:34.201,Hello.
00:00:34.242,00:00:36.203,It's time.
00:00:36.244,00:00:37.830,Why are you so cynical?
00:00:40.123,00:00:42.751,And there's optimism.
00:00:46.129,00:00:47.172,You never know.
00:00:48.382,00:00:51.218,You want the Cooper story?
00:00:51.259,00:00:54.054,"I can't give it to you, 'cause I'm not him."
00:00:55.681,00:00:57.057,"The lawyers you tried to blow up, they're still running around."
00:00:57.098,00:00:58.392,Same thing goes with the kid.
00:00:58.433,00:01:00.602,You gotta hand the reins over to me now.
00:01:00.644,00:01:02.270,First of all...
00:01:50.360,00:01:51.486,SCOFIELD: That one.
00:01:51.528,00:01:53.113,SALESMAN: Nice choice.
00:01:53.781,00:01:56.075,Platinum. Brushed.
00:01:56.366,00:01:57.826,6.25?
00:01:57.868,00:01:59.327,6.25.
00:02:00.328,00:02:02.247,She's a lucky woman.
00:02:02.706,00:02:04.083,Yes.
00:02:05.084,00:02:06.334,She is.
00:02:11.673,00:02:13.300,You kept it.
00:02:13.341,00:02:14.468,Kept what?
00:02:15.218,00:02:16.428,The flower.
00:02:17.846,00:02:19.932,No. I'm a pack rat.
00:02:19.974,00:02:22.350,"Yeah, all this clutter."
00:02:25.228,00:02:26.271,Whoa.
00:02:26.313,00:02:30.275,"Haven't even had our first date yet and, uh, you're already inviting me in."
00:02:31.234,00:02:32.235,Thought you were a nice girl.
00:02:32.277,00:02:34.488,"Oh, Michael, we all know nice girls finish last."
00:02:39.910,00:02:40.911,It depends on where I start.
00:02:40.953,00:02:42.037,Deep breath.
00:02:44.039,00:02:45.248,Exhale.
00:02:46.458,00:02:48.502,Inhale.
00:02:56.760,00:02:59.304,"Sara, we're backing up out here."
00:02:59.346,00:03:01.098,Right. I'm sorry.
00:03:04.643,00:03:06.478,I'm going to get your shot.
00:03:42.305,00:03:46.018,This is not what I signed on for.
00:03:48.269,00:03:49.270,You want us to wave the white flag?
00:03:49.312,00:03:50.856,Call a timeout?
00:03:50.898,00:03:52.232,Lincoln?
00:03:52.273,00:03:57.278,We just found out that Vice President Reynolds funneled millions of dollars in research grants into her brother's company.
00:03:57.320,00:04:04.452,That money was filtered into millions of small accounts that--that made millions of small donations to her campaign setting her up to be the next leader of the free world.
00:04:04.494,00:04:07.789,"I mean, t-this doesn't end with us stopping an execution anymore."
00:04:07.831,00:04:09.332,"For me, it does."
00:04:30.353,00:04:32.689,"Okay, let's rotate."
00:04:33.857,00:04:36.276,"Sergeant Sodomy, you're up next."
00:04:36.860,00:04:37.861,Yo.
00:04:40.030,00:04:41.865,Come on.
00:04:41.907,00:04:47.871,"I don't know about you all, but this room is gettin' a little too dark for me to dig."
00:04:50.207,00:04:54.502,"Now, are you tellin' me that there's a hole in Fox River that you don't wanna get into?"
00:04:56.880,00:04:59.507,"Hey, no one gets hurt."
00:05:00.425,00:05:02.427,"You know, I got a question."
00:05:04.096,00:05:06.389,"Now, how come Fusilli over here ain't grabbing a shovel?"
00:05:06.431,00:05:07.891,I'm handling arrangements on the outside.
00:05:07.933,00:05:11.352,"Really? So what is that, transpo, paper, what?"
00:05:11.394,00:05:13.480,Exactly. It makes me management.
00:05:13.521,00:05:15.356,"And that makes us just labor, right?"
00:05:15.398,00:05:17.484,Mmm-hmm.
00:05:19.653,00:05:23.573,"You know, management better keep a close eye on the conditions up in here."
00:05:23.615,00:05:26.367,Or the labor's liable to go on strike.
00:05:26.409,00:05:27.577,Get back to work.
00:05:27.619,00:05:28.870,"Whoa, whoa, CO coming."
00:05:34.876,00:05:37.296,"Come on, cover it up."
00:05:41.800,00:05:43.010,Put that back up there.
00:05:46.721,00:05:49.224,"Scofield, move it."
00:05:50.100,00:05:50.892,It's time for your conjugal.
00:05:53.436,00:05:54.896,Your wife is here.
00:06:36.813,00:06:38.023,So you're Mrs. Scofield.
00:06:39.482,00:06:41.400,Have you done this before?
00:06:42.443,00:06:44.363,"Had a conjugal, I mean."
00:06:44.403,00:06:45.530,No.
00:06:45.572,00:06:49.034,Don't worry.
00:06:51.912,00:06:53.412,Clear.
00:06:58.501,00:07:00.254,She look familiar to you?
00:07:00.628,00:07:02.130,"No, Captain."
00:07:05.175,00:07:06.218,I know her from somewhere.
00:07:13.183,00:07:14.434,You came.
00:07:17.020,00:07:18.146,How have you been?
00:07:18.188,00:07:21.441,Fine. I found a job.
00:07:22.276,00:07:24.444,Good. I'm glad.
00:07:26.529,00:07:28.031,Is it awful being here?
00:07:29.616,00:07:32.411,Remember the first place you stayed?
00:07:34.288,00:07:37.457,Only difference is $69 and the free shampoo.
00:07:38.666,00:07:40.627,Always the brave face.
00:07:44.881,00:07:45.966,Every day.
00:07:47.259,00:07:48.427,I worry about you.
00:07:49.261,00:07:50.304,Don't.
00:07:51.554,00:07:54.308,Is there anything else that I can do?
00:07:54.975,00:07:56.643,Just what we agreed on.
00:07:57.769,00:08:00.855,I was so nervous when they were checking.
00:08:09.572,00:08:11.532,"See, I don't think the riot changed anything."
00:08:11.574,00:08:13.327,Have you seen the latest budget cuts for this place?
00:08:13.368,00:08:14.911,Another 10% from health care.
00:08:14.953,00:08:16.537,And 35% from prevention.
00:08:16.579,00:08:18.748,"He might be the governor, but he's also your father."
00:08:18.790,00:08:21.542,Maybe he thinks if he cuts enough they can't afford you.
00:08:25.755,00:08:26.798,SCOFIELD: Thank you.
00:08:35.056,00:08:39.560,"BELLICK: You understand this is standard procedure following a conjugal, right, Scofield?"
00:08:39.602,00:08:40.728,Never can be too careful.
00:08:40.770,00:08:43.190,"All right, bend over."
00:08:45.733,00:08:49.196,You have a good time in the romper room with that Euro?
00:08:49.821,00:08:51.448,"Whatever you say, boss."
00:08:52.240,00:08:53.908,She come around here before?
00:08:54.617,00:08:55.535,You sure?
00:08:56.953,00:08:58.955,"'Cause, damn if I don't recognize her from somewhere."
00:09:00.207,00:09:01.916,Maybe she visits some other con.
00:09:01.958,00:09:04.585,Killin' two birds with one bone.
00:09:04.627,00:09:06.129,Catchin' my drift?
00:09:06.171,00:09:07.588,I wouldn't know.
00:09:08.631,00:09:10.550,All right.
00:09:10.591,00:09:12.010,"Make sure you take a shower, Scofield."
00:09:12.052,00:09:15.514,You never know what some women can give you.
00:09:16.848,00:09:31.905,"' Swing low ' ' Sweet chariot ' ' Comin' for to carry me home ' ' Swing low ' T-BAG: You know this one, don't you?"
00:09:31.946,00:09:39.329,"' Sweet chariot ' ' Comin' for to carry me home '' Come on, give me somethin'."
00:09:39.371,00:09:42.040,I thought you was a musical people.
00:09:43.666,00:09:45.835,"You know, your parents must be so proud of you, man."
00:09:45.877,00:09:48.588,"I mean, hittin' the trailer park trifecta."
00:09:48.629,00:09:51.966,"You know, racist, pedophile, and stupid."
00:09:53.760,00:09:55.887,"You know, it vexes me that..."
00:09:55.929,00:09:59.599,That I'm made out to be the bad guy in the room.
00:09:59.640,00:10:02.102,It's not like y'all are incarcerated for stealing Girl Scout cookies.
00:10:02.143,00:10:05.397,None of us murdered any Girl Scouts in the process.
00:10:06.689,00:10:07.982,Michael's coming back from the boneyard.
00:10:16.950,00:10:19.827,"I tell you everything about me and Maricruz, and you can't even tell me you're married?"
00:10:19.869,00:10:21.204,Later.
00:10:22.956,00:10:25.959,"A rough day, huh, Scofield?"
00:10:34.717,00:10:36.511,Man's got a point.
00:10:36.553,00:10:38.597,It just doesn't seem equitable like.
00:10:38.638,00:10:39.764,"Shut up and dig, T-Bag."
00:10:39.806,00:10:47.021,"I think what the idiots inside here want to know is, while we're diggin' this hole, what are you doin'?"
00:10:51.985,00:10:52.986,I'm goin' shoppin'.
00:10:54.904,00:10:57.782,We're good.
00:10:58.783,00:11:00.660,All clear.
00:11:03.455,00:11:05.706,A credit card?
00:11:03.455,00:11:07.584,"The bulls catch you with that, they'll be so far up your doggie door, you'll be..."
00:11:07.626,00:11:10.753,"Don't worry, they won't be catching me with one."
00:11:10.795,00:11:11.879,How are you so sure?
00:11:11.921,00:11:14.257,Because...
00:11:15.634,00:11:16.675,I don't have a credit card.
00:13:01.989,00:13:03.199,VERONICA: Nick.
00:13:03.241,00:13:05.368,QUINN: Help! Please.
00:13:12.833,00:13:14.835,"Please, is anybody there?"
00:13:14.877,00:13:16.713,I can't just ignore him.
00:13:16.755,00:13:17.714,The hell we can't.
00:13:17.756,00:13:19.299,Help me. Please.
00:13:21.635,00:13:22.801,"Help me, please."
00:13:23.386,00:13:25.346,"Oh, God!"
00:13:31.227,00:13:32.479,What happened?
00:13:32.520,00:13:35.064,"I don't know, I must've dozed off."
00:13:35.106,00:13:36.899,I've been drivin' for 12 hours.
00:13:36.941,00:13:38.151,Shall I get him some water from the well?
00:13:38.192,00:13:40.111,The well's dried up.
00:13:40.153,00:13:43.822,"All right, I think there's a medical kit over here."
00:13:49.788,00:13:50.913,No one's goin' anywhere.
00:14:13.936,00:14:15.896,"All right, say goodbye to junior."
00:14:27.575,00:14:30.578,You know how many pints of blood the human body has?
00:14:32.539,00:14:34.874,The answer is 10.
00:14:38.628,00:14:41.339,How many you think prince charming over there on the floor has left?
00:14:41.381,00:14:44.175,"Eight, goin' on seven?"
00:14:44.217,00:14:45.343,Tell you what.
00:14:45.385,00:14:47.762,I'm gonna take him out to the woodshed.
00:14:47.804,00:14:48.888,We're gonna have a little talk.
00:14:48.929,00:14:51.808,"In the meantime, I want you to chew on this."
00:14:53.518,00:15:03.110,"You tell me everything that you have discovered about the Burrows case, and who else you've told about it, and there's a chance that I might let you go in time to get Mr. Savrinn to a doctor."
00:15:09.992,00:15:15.707,"The guy waitin' to die on death row, or the guy wishin' he'd die out in the woodshed."
00:15:28.803,00:15:29.721,"One suit, black."
00:15:33.516,00:15:35.518,"One pair of socks, black."
00:15:36.936,00:15:39.731,One pair of shoes. Shoelaces.
00:15:42.358,00:15:45.319,One small tape recorder.
00:15:50.032,00:15:52.786,One gold watch.
00:16:13.055,00:16:15.266,"You ever stay at a fancy hotel, LJ?"
00:16:15.308,00:16:17.936,"You know, you leave your room in the morning and it's a mess."
00:16:17.977,00:16:20.146,"Wet, dirty towels on the bathroom floor."
00:16:20.187,00:16:22.857,Last night's room service stinkin' to high heaven.
00:16:22.899,00:16:29.029,"Then you come back at night, it's all gone."
00:16:29.071,00:16:31.282,"Fresh towels, clean sheets, candy on the pillow."
00:16:31.324,00:16:36.036,"It's just the best feeling in the whole world, 'cause someone else cleaned up your mess."
00:16:36.078,00:16:37.580,All you had to do was walk away.
00:16:42.084,00:16:43.544,Don't you hurt them.
00:16:43.586,00:16:44.587,Okay.
00:16:45.922,00:16:51.678,"But you gotta tell me exactly what they know and who else they have told, and nobody has to die tonight."
00:16:51.719,00:16:52.720,You just walk away.
00:16:53.972,00:16:55.723,Let me clean up your mess.
00:16:55.765,00:16:58.601,I don't know what's going on.
00:17:01.103,00:17:03.105,"Well, I wish I could believe that."
00:17:11.113,00:17:12.949,Bellick assigned me a new cellmate.
00:17:12.991,00:17:14.074,Who'd you get?
00:17:14.116,00:17:15.075,Some new fish.
00:17:15.117,00:17:18.162,Ran a bump and swipe on an off-duty cop.
00:17:19.121,00:17:21.081,"Fast hands, faster mouth."
00:17:21.123,00:17:22.834,"Yo, what's cracking, my peoples?"
00:17:24.126,00:17:25.962,"Michael Scofield, David Apolskis."
00:17:26.004,00:17:27.922,What's up?
00:17:27.964,00:17:30.758,"I seen you before, right?"
00:17:33.135,00:17:34.846,"You know, brother needs to make some green, some cash-eesh."
00:17:34.888,00:17:36.764,You know what I'm saying?
00:17:36.806,00:17:38.016,The pay is 19 cents an hour.
00:17:38.057,00:17:40.935,19 cents?
00:17:40.977,00:17:42.896,"It's prison, yo."
00:17:42.937,00:17:46.357,"And besides, PI is all full up for now."
00:17:48.150,00:17:49.986,"All right, I feel you."
00:17:51.153,00:17:52.112,"But keep a brother in mind, all right?"
00:17:52.154,00:17:54.114,"If somethin' opens up, you know?"
00:17:54.156,00:17:57.994,"Hell, I'll pay 19 cents an hour to get me some more time out the block."
00:17:59.161,00:18:02.122,Like havin' another kid.
00:18:02.164,00:18:04.083,I'm too old to do it again.
00:18:05.543,00:18:07.545,You ever hear of anything being stolen from R and D?
00:18:07.587,00:18:11.131,Of course. Bulls steal from the personals all the time.
00:18:11.173,00:18:15.135,"Problem is, you never know what's gone until you're on the outside of the walls."
00:18:17.179,00:18:19.057,What if you knew now?
00:18:20.182,00:18:23.686,"Look, I told you, leave me out of whatever it is you've got goin'."
00:18:23.728,00:18:28.148,I just need to know if you've seen a guard with a gold watch.
00:18:28.190,00:18:31.151,There's a lot of people who can get you a gold watch in here.
00:18:31.193,00:18:34.072,"Yeah, but I need this specific gold watch."
00:18:34.113,00:18:35.155,Westmoreland!
00:18:35.197,00:18:36.991,Pope wants to see you.
00:18:38.158,00:18:39.577,Let's go!
00:18:40.995,00:18:43.706,"Look, I haven't seen nothing."
00:18:43.748,00:18:45.583,But there is this one CO.
00:18:45.625,00:18:48.127,Word is he's the worst thief in here.
00:18:52.172,00:18:55.093,My wife just faxed this over for you from county records.
00:18:55.134,00:18:57.095,Copy of Scofield's marriage license.
00:18:57.136,00:18:58.596,She says you owe her big time.
00:18:58.638,00:19:00.180,Looks legit.
00:19:02.224,00:19:06.312,Says here they got married the day before Scofield robbed that bank.
00:19:15.947,00:19:16.948,Heard from Veronica?
00:19:16.990,00:19:18.116,No.
00:19:20.743,00:19:23.037,"Just a note from LJ saying he's with her, that he was safe."
00:19:25.247,00:19:27.708,Doesn't feel right.
00:19:28.250,00:19:29.335,Feels wrong.
00:19:29.961,00:19:31.211,I gotta go.
00:19:31.253,00:19:33.047,Really wrong.
00:19:33.464,00:19:34.674,I'll see you.
00:19:42.140,00:19:43.182,"QUINN: I, uh..."
00:19:44.767,00:19:54.193,"I've come to a realization that either Miss Donovan and that boy don't like you very much, or they have an unreasonable amount of faith in your cardiovascular system."
00:19:54.234,00:19:57.321,"So tell me, Nick, this all you got?"
00:19:59.073,00:20:01.617,This paper trail of an indictment that never even happened?
00:20:01.659,00:20:03.036,Is this it?
00:20:05.121,00:20:07.206,We know you don't have anybody to testify.
00:20:07.247,00:20:09.959,So is this really all you've got?
00:20:12.252,00:20:21.888,"Mr. Savrinn, that bullet went through your teres major, ripped the lateral margin of your scapula, leaving you absolutely no medial rotation of your arm."
00:20:21.929,00:20:30.312,"So you try to swing that piece of lumber at me, it's gonna feel like your arm is ripping out of its socket."
00:20:32.272,00:20:36.152,"Come on, Nick."
00:20:37.319,00:20:39.072,"We both know why you're really here, don't we?"
00:20:39.113,00:20:42.116,And it ain't to save Lincoln Burrows' life.
00:20:46.328,00:20:49.289,C.O. ON P.A. SYSTEM: All prisoners have 15 minutes of walk time.
00:20:49.331,00:21:10.019,' Inside these walls I creep and I crawl ' ' Lookin' for a way out ' ' But I know there's gonna be no easy route ' ' This is gonna be a 12-round ' ' A 12-round bout ' ' With Bellick and T-Bag on my mind ' ' This grind in here ' You still interested in getting in on PI?
00:21:10.061,00:21:12.105,Does my mama got big breastices?
00:21:13.313,00:21:15.149,"Hell yes, she does."
00:21:16.358,00:21:17.568,"All right, look, I need a favor."
00:21:17.610,00:21:20.487,Word is you made your trade as a snatch-and-grab.
00:21:21.363,00:21:23.032,That's right.
00:21:25.952,00:21:27.286,What kind of somethin' we talkin' about?
00:21:27.327,00:21:29.329,Just a watch.
00:21:29.371,00:21:31.207,There ain't no such thing as just a watch.
00:21:31.249,00:21:32.959,Every design has a different clasp.
00:21:33.000,00:21:36.170,Every clasp has a different swipe.
00:21:36.212,00:21:37.213,It's Italian. A Remedi.
00:21:40.340,00:21:41.341,What year?
00:21:44.511,00:21:45.429,Which means what?
00:21:45.471,00:21:47.347,Hidden deployment.
00:21:47.389,00:21:50.309,There ain't no way to snatch it without the mark feeling it.
00:21:52.061,00:21:56.523,Which just means I'm gonna have to get whimsical on this vicky.
00:22:00.402,00:22:03.281,"I get you this watch, that mean I get in on some of that PI?"
00:22:03.322,00:22:06.284,It means I'll think about it.
00:22:06.325,00:22:09.036,Why you need this watch so bad anyway?
00:22:10.412,00:22:12.665,Let's just say it means a lot to someone in my family.
00:22:27.221,00:22:30.057,"Come in, Charles. Sit down."
00:22:36.438,00:22:37.397,What's going on?
00:22:41.110,00:22:43.487,"I've got some bad news, Charles."
00:22:47.283,00:22:49.409,She's got esophageal cancer.
00:22:49.451,00:22:57.293,"Now she's at Sacred Heart in Indianapolis, and she wants to see you while there's still time."
00:22:57.710,00:22:59.295,How much time?
00:22:59.920,00:23:01.379,Doctors say a few weeks.
00:23:02.631,00:23:04.842,"The problem is, the DOC is not gonna let you go."
00:23:06.468,00:23:08.304,She's my only child.
00:23:08.346,00:23:10.056,I know that.
00:23:11.473,00:23:13.226,"Believe me, Charles, I've lobbied on your behalf."
00:23:13.267,00:23:16.020,I-It's-- It's state policy.
00:23:17.479,00:23:20.398,They will only extend furloughs in the case of funerals.
00:23:22.484,00:23:29.283,You're telling me I have to wait until she dies before I see her?
00:23:39.501,00:23:42.796,Looks like I'll be administering your shot today.
00:23:42.838,00:23:43.797,Where's Dr. Tancredi?
00:23:43.839,00:23:46.008,We've got a busy schedule today.
00:23:46.050,00:23:46.842,She's with another patient.
00:23:48.219,00:23:50.054,C.O.: Hold his legs!
00:23:50.096,00:23:52.765,"Hey, we need a doctor here!"
00:23:54.516,00:23:58.812,"The kid was in chow, and all of a sudden he--he collapsed and he started spittin' up his food."
00:23:58.854,00:24:00.522,He looks like he's having some kind of seizure.
00:24:04.651,00:24:06.612,I'm gonna need O2 and cardio from you.
00:24:11.533,00:24:14.036,"Hold him, hold him."
00:24:39.312,00:24:44.482,"So, Miss Donovan, how is that background in real estate law goin' for you?"
00:24:44.524,00:24:45.483,It's a big help?
00:24:46.110,00:24:47.361,Hmm?
00:24:47.403,00:24:50.530,"You know, frankly, I think we caught a break."
00:24:50.572,00:24:56.203,"If Lincoln had nailed a girl with half a brain, she probably would've brought this whole thing down already."
00:24:57.455,00:25:00.958,But you know what the worst part is?
00:25:01.000,00:25:06.464,"That you dragged these people into this, knowing that you had no clue how to get them out."
00:25:06.504,00:25:12.428,"I mean, if you had just minded your own business, people like Leticia Barris, she wouldn't have a mouthful of maggots right about now."
00:25:12.470,00:25:22.271,Your fiance would not be lying in his apartment waiting for the smell of his rotting corpse to let the neighbors know that something had gone horribly wrong.
00:25:22.313,00:25:25.191,That's right.
00:25:26.317,00:25:29.527,You made this mess.
00:25:29.569,00:25:34.532,But you're also the one person that can end it all right here.
00:25:35.742,00:25:38.536,All I need to know is who else you've involved.
00:25:53.093,00:25:58.391,"You know, Miss Donovan, I think that, uh, you look a little cold."
00:25:59.433,00:26:04.938,Maybe you'll find it easier to talk after you've warmed up a little bit.
00:26:12.654,00:26:15.115,Where is he?
00:26:18.785,00:26:21.579,Come on.
00:26:24.041,00:26:25.459,Where are the keys?
00:26:25.501,00:26:26.584,"Pocket, left."
00:26:28.670,00:26:29.713,Is he gonna be all right?
00:26:29.755,00:26:31.257,"Go start the car, LJ."
00:27:04.622,00:27:06.624,A gift from my cellmate.
00:27:07.709,00:27:10.254,Thank you. And thank him.
00:27:11.255,00:27:13.340,The watch.
00:27:13.382,00:27:15.633,Thought you didn't want to know about any of this.
00:27:15.675,00:27:18.636,Things have changed.
00:27:19.679,00:27:21.014,Why the sudden change of heart?
00:27:21.056,00:27:22.640,I have my reasons.
00:27:28.981,00:27:29.898,How about money?
00:27:29.940,00:27:31.317,How much are we talking about?
00:27:31.358,00:27:32.943,I think you know.
00:27:32.985,00:27:37.030,"I seem to remember several conversations that ended with, I am not D.B. Cooper."
00:27:37.072,00:27:38.698,I lied.
00:27:38.740,00:27:41.034,We're cons.
00:27:42.328,00:27:43.870,I checked your alibi.
00:27:42.328,00:27:46.582,"According to records, you were incarcerated at the time of the Cooper hijacking."
00:27:48.208,00:27:51.711,My father and I share more than just a weakness for easy money.
00:27:53.755,00:27:58.552,Charles Westmoreland Senior was the one locked up that day.
00:28:01.180,00:28:04.016,"No offense, but it's a little convenient."
00:28:05.225,00:28:06.726,"You want in, and suddenly you're the guy."
00:28:06.768,00:28:08.728,How do I know you're not lying right now?
00:28:08.770,00:28:11.190,"C.O.: Hey, Old Man River."
00:28:47.809,00:28:54.608,"Hey, Sucre, I got a question about you and the rest of the Mexicans."
00:28:56.318,00:28:59.488,"I don't think I'll be able to help, seeing as I'm Puerto Rican."
00:28:59.530,00:29:00.906,"Geographical semantics, amigo."
00:29:00.947,00:29:04.410,I'm speaking about the general Latino population.
00:29:12.626,00:29:15.921,"They way I see things, it's everyone else that's lazy."
00:29:17.673,00:29:19.383,"Otherwise, there wouldn't be any jobs for the immigrants."
00:29:19.425,00:29:25.598,"The ones sitting at home collecting unemployment, the lazy ones, that's not us."
00:29:28.308,00:29:30.810,You--You gonna let him talk about your people like that?
00:29:30.852,00:29:32.938,"Yeah, yeah, whatever, Deliverance."
00:29:34.231,00:29:36.900,You know what?
00:29:36.942,00:29:42.531,"But just so that you know, the minute we get over that wall, it's every man for himself."
00:29:43.365,00:29:44.408,Or sooner.
00:29:56.795,00:29:58.797,LJ?
00:30:02.884,00:30:03.802,LJ?
00:30:16.398,00:30:22.946,"They let you live, and they kill everyone else in your family, and a-a-anyone you've ever loved."
00:30:23.739,00:30:24.740,How's that sound?
00:30:24.782,00:30:25.865,Go to hell.
00:30:25.907,00:30:27.117,"Oh, come on."
00:30:28.160,00:30:29.828,Is that any way for a lady to talk?
00:30:35.917,00:30:37.503,You think I'm an idiot?
00:30:37.544,00:30:39.755,I'm just gonna walk into a well?
00:30:50.182,00:30:51.891,You all right?
00:31:01.193,00:31:02.902,"C.O. ON P.A. SYSTEM: Attention, inmates."
00:31:02.944,00:31:05.947,The weight pile is out of bounds until further notice.
00:31:05.989,00:31:09.535,The weight pile is out of bounds until further notice.
00:31:44.986,00:31:46.780,I want you out here workin' where I can see you.
00:31:46.822,00:31:47.906,"I'm on it, boss."
00:31:48.990,00:31:50.909,"Move it, Scofield!"
00:31:57.165,00:32:00.001,The yard is open.
00:33:01.020,00:33:02.147,"Hey, Brad."
00:33:02.188,00:33:04.065,"Hey, baby."
00:33:06.067,00:33:07.986,Put your hands together for our next lovely young lady.
00:33:08.027,00:33:09.988,Up on the main stage is Jasmine.
00:33:36.097,00:33:38.057,Would you like a private dance?
00:33:41.186,00:33:42.479,See if we hit it off.
00:33:44.105,00:33:46.065,"So, what's your name?"
00:33:49.110,00:33:50.069,Jasmine.
00:33:50.111,00:33:52.071,Come on. Your real name.
00:33:55.701,00:33:57.076,It's Nika.
00:33:57.118,00:33:58.036,Nika.
00:33:59.120,00:34:01.039,That's a pretty name.
00:34:10.131,00:34:12.885,I hope you're lying for the sake of titillation.
00:34:14.177,00:34:18.056,"Otherwise, your little visit to Fox River this morning would've been breakin' the law."
00:34:20.141,00:34:21.059,Mrs. Scofield.
00:34:25.063,00:34:28.107,"We are married, but they tell all the girls to lie."
00:34:28.149,00:34:29.902,It's better for making business.
00:34:29.943,00:34:32.070,I'm not here to get you in trouble.
00:34:33.572,00:34:35.073,I just want to know a little more about your husband.
00:34:36.157,00:34:38.201,"Well, he's a very good man."
00:34:38.243,00:34:39.745,I'm sure he is.
00:34:39.786,00:34:41.079,But even good men do bad things.
00:34:45.166,00:34:48.127,Your accent.
00:34:50.171,00:34:51.089,Prague.
00:34:51.506,00:34:53.132,Prague.
00:34:53.174,00:34:55.510,How recently did you come over?
00:34:56.511,00:34:58.137,"Only a couple of months, I bet."
00:34:58.179,00:35:00.139,You like it here in America?
00:35:01.808,00:35:03.518,They don't like us to spend too much time in one spot.
00:35:03.560,00:35:07.105,"Now, I don't want to have to check into your immigration status."
00:35:09.232,00:35:14.153,I just need to know what Michael Scofield wanted from you in exchange for the green card.
00:35:16.197,00:35:19.743,Nothing. We met while he was studying overseas.
00:35:19.785,00:35:23.121,I don't want to know what you memorized for the INS.
00:35:23.162,00:35:28.126,"Now, either you answer my questions about Scofield, or I call my guy in the Chicago PD."
00:35:29.461,00:35:32.130,And maybe he starts askin' some questions about you.
00:35:36.468,00:35:38.095,Credit card.
00:35:39.262,00:35:40.138,"He asked me to bring him a credit card, that's it."
00:36:31.857,00:36:34.192,"No, thanks."
00:36:37.487,00:36:41.199,Dorothy Andrews Elston Kabis.
00:36:42.283,00:36:47.622,"United States Treasurer in 1971, the year of the D.B. Cooper hijacking."
00:36:50.291,00:36:53.252,DI 192589.
00:36:53.294,00:36:58.508,The first number in the series of bills used in the ransom drop.
00:36:59.467,00:37:02.345,Thanks for the history lesson.
00:37:03.889,00:37:06.933,"All it proves is you did the research, same as me."
00:37:46.264,00:37:47.515,So you're married.
00:37:50.351,00:37:52.311,"Uh, well, not in the traditional sense of the word."
00:37:52.353,00:37:56.315,"Michael, we're both adults."
00:38:00.361,00:38:02.114,"Okay, I'll go first."
00:38:03.698,00:38:04.866,Um...
00:38:04.908,00:38:14.167,"As one of the very few women around here, I'm used to a certain amount of innuendo and flirtation being thrown my way."
00:38:15.460,00:38:17.462,I'm not used to enjoying it.
00:38:17.503,00:38:18.588,"Look, Sara..."
00:38:18.630,00:38:21.340,It's Dr. Tancredi.
00:38:21.382,00:38:23.260,And please let me finish.
00:38:25.386,00:38:27.513,"I'm not a jealous woman, but I'm a careful one."
00:38:29.224,00:38:32.351,"And for some reason, when I'm around you I'm not careful."
00:38:32.393,00:38:33.352,You don't have to be.
00:38:33.394,00:38:34.646,"Yes, I do."
00:38:34.687,00:38:38.483,"There are so many questions surrounding you, Michael."
00:38:42.028,00:38:43.613,So here's the deal. Um...
00:38:43.655,00:38:50.369,"From now on, your shots, any medical concerns, they're all fine, as long as it's doctor-patient."
00:38:50.411,00:38:55.667,But personal questions and favors of any kind are no longer a part of our relationship.
00:38:58.419,00:39:00.421,The questions you have about me.
00:39:03.091,00:39:04.676,There are answers.
00:39:14.477,00:39:16.062,Quinn!
00:39:17.438,00:39:18.564,"Hey, I was getting worried."
00:39:18.606,00:39:23.320,"We tried to call you again to pinpoint your signal, but you never picked up."
00:39:25.446,00:39:26.281,"What are you gonna do, right?"
00:39:26.323,00:39:28.825,"So, uh, how'd it go?"
00:39:31.452,00:39:34.998,"Yeah, listen, you know, I think maybe we got off on the wrong foot."
00:39:35.040,00:39:40.045,"You got bosses, I got bosses, but at the end of the day we're all on the same team, right?"
00:39:40.086,00:39:41.546,We're just tryin' to tie up some loose ends.
00:39:41.587,00:39:44.174,I could not agree more.
00:39:55.852,00:39:57.603,Hey! Hey!
00:39:57.645,00:39:59.438,Just tyin' up some loose ends.
00:39:59.480,00:40:00.439,You stupid son...
00:40:00.481,00:40:02.525,"Hey, guys, don't do this."
00:40:02.567,00:40:04.402,Don't do this.
00:40:06.196,00:40:07.155,"Come on, please."
00:40:07.197,00:40:08.447,I can't stand.
00:40:08.489,00:40:11.450,You can't just leave him down there.
00:40:11.492,00:40:12.994,"I'm beggin' you, okay?"
00:40:13.036,00:40:16.581,He's the only one who knows we don't have the Burrows kid.
00:40:16.622,00:40:18.416,I got a family!
00:40:19.792,00:40:23.462,Kellerman! Hale! Guys...
00:40:23.504,00:40:25.048,"There's room for you down there, too, Danny."
00:40:28.718,00:40:32.013,Don't leave me like this.
00:40:38.561,00:40:41.522,You coming back to PI today?
00:40:41.564,00:40:43.149,"It's getting kind of testy in there, you know?"
00:40:43.191,00:40:45.026,SCOFIELD: Yeah.
00:40:47.445,00:40:49.114,I just needed to find something out.
00:40:49.781,00:40:50.615,What the hell is that?
00:40:50.656,00:40:52.825,Listen.
00:40:58.456,00:40:59.832,Am I supposed to be hearing something?
00:40:59.874,00:41:02.043,Just hold on.
00:41:19.685,00:41:21.146,There.
00:41:21.187,00:41:22.521,What?
00:41:22.563,00:41:24.565,We sat around here for 20 minutes waiting to hear that?
00:41:24.607,00:41:26.025,"Eighteen minutes, actually."
00:41:27.068,00:41:28.569,And yes.
00:41:30.280,00:41:32.031,What was it?
00:41:32.824,00:41:34.451,The guards' keys.
00:41:34.492,00:41:40.539,Eighteen minutes is how long we have between each time the guards pass beneath the infirmary windows on their rounds at night.
00:41:42.875,00:41:44.961,It was the only way I could find out the timing.
00:41:45.003,00:41:47.505,What does that mean?
00:41:45.003,00:41:56.514,"It means four days from now, on the night of the escape, we'll have 18 minutes to get the bars off the infirmary window and for all seven of us to get across the wire and over the wall."
00:41:57.598,00:41:58.557,Is that doable?
00:41:58.599,00:41:59.851,Of course.
00:42:13.614,00:42:14.782,What's up?
00:42:16.451,00:42:17.994,Nothing.
00:42:18.036,00:42:20.372,"Hey, I know that look."
00:42:20.955,00:42:22.540,I hit it! I hit it!
00:42:27.628,00:42:29.381,"LINCOLN: Guys, guys."
00:42:30.673,00:42:32.633,"All right, all right, give him some room."
00:42:35.512,00:42:37.972,"Come on, Michael, talk to me."
00:42:38.014,00:42:39.598,Want the good news or the bad news?
00:42:40.599,00:42:42.519,Westmoreland and his money are in.
00:42:43.895,00:42:45.146,What's the bad?
00:42:46.647,00:42:54.447,I figure it'll take at least five minutes for us to get the bars off the window in the infirmary and two minutes for each of us to get across the wire and over the wall.
00:42:54.489,00:42:57.033,So?
00:43:00.619,00:43:02.663,That's it. That's it.
00:43:03.664,00:43:05.666,And one of 'em has to go.
00:00:01.460,00:00:03.086,MALE NARRATOR: Previously on Prison Break...
00:00:15.098,00:00:17.184,Is that doable?
00:00:20.103,00:00:22.272,"Yeah, well, Hector says that you could serve your full sentence."
00:00:26.109,00:00:29.697,"This is a joke, right?"
00:00:31.156,00:00:35.076,I just need to know what Michael Scofield wanted from you in exchange for the green card.
00:00:35.118,00:00:37.329,NIKA: Why would you need a credit card in prison?
00:00:45.004,00:00:46.463,"Keep talking like that, I'm gonna be forced to put a bullet in your head."
00:00:55.138,00:00:57.098,So?
00:00:57.140,00:01:01.061,I've done the math.
00:01:03.230,00:01:06.525,Sorry to keep you waiting.
00:01:06.567,00:01:07.735,Hmm.
00:01:08.276,00:01:09.486,Impressive resume.
00:01:10.153,00:01:12.113,Thank you.
00:01:12.155,00:01:15.200,Tell me why you chose to pursue a career in engineering.
00:01:15.242,00:01:20.080,"Well, um, I've always been interested in, uh, structure."
00:01:20.873,00:01:22.082,Geometry.
00:01:23.166,00:01:26.085,How things fit together.
00:01:27.295,00:01:32.091,"How an object that, uh, performs a function can also be a work of art."
00:01:33.761,00:01:37.096,What about the future?
00:01:49.777,00:01:52.279,"One suit, black."
00:03:46.309,00:03:48.854,Take after his momma.
00:03:57.320,00:04:03.243,"But, uh, things are getting pretty tense."
00:04:06.329,00:04:08.207,"You know what I mean, Jimmy?"
00:04:08.248,00:04:12.252,"There's a potential, uh, situation."
00:04:17.382,00:04:20.385,How much time?
00:04:17.382,00:04:24.139,Enough for me to find my way up a 20 foot vertical drainpipe without using a ladder.
00:04:28.351,00:04:31.271,You can't just skip it.
00:04:31.312,00:04:33.857,What if one of the bulls decided to drop in?
00:04:33.899,00:04:36.235,"Well, I don't have a choice, do I?"
00:04:45.368,00:04:47.621,Westmoreland's gonna be a problem.
00:04:47.662,00:04:50.331,All seven of us can't break over that wall in 18 minutes.
00:04:50.373,00:04:52.375,You said it yourself.
00:04:52.417,00:04:55.796,"Listen, man, I'm telling you, one of us has gotta take a hike."
00:04:55.837,00:04:57.297,SCOFIELD: I know.
00:04:58.590,00:05:00.842,Mind if I share that with the rest of the class?
00:05:02.302,00:05:05.430,"C-NOTE: Apparently, college boy here did the math."
00:05:06.890,00:05:09.184,Figured out that we got too many clowns in the car.
00:05:09.226,00:05:13.063,"So one of us is in here digging, but his seat ain't guaranteed."
00:05:15.398,00:05:18.359,I'm not gonna dig if I'm not gonna go.
00:05:18.401,00:05:20.361,We need to make a decision on who gets cut.
00:05:20.403,00:05:24.199,"Well, I think we all can agree who that should be, right?"
00:05:28.411,00:05:30.497,Pardon me for interrupting.
00:05:31.206,00:05:35.710,"But, uh, what's that smell?"
00:05:39.840,00:05:42.383,It smells a little like conspiracy.
00:05:42.425,00:05:44.427,We need to get back to work.
00:05:42.425,00:05:46.847,"Yeah, before you do, I have an announcement to make."
00:05:46.888,00:05:50.391,"I've been growing leery the way you all talk, like I'm a lesser man."
00:05:50.433,00:05:53.394,So I bought an insurance policy.
00:05:53.436,00:05:57.440,I called up my guy on the outside and I told him about our plan.
00:05:57.482,00:06:01.402,And I told him in all likelihood I'll be seeing him next week.
00:06:12.664,00:06:20.379,"So if you all got ideas about getting rid of me, I suggest you make other plans."
00:07:01.420,00:07:03.506,Son of a bitch has got a countermove for everything.
00:07:08.595,00:07:09.512,Odd men out.
00:07:09.554,00:07:12.391,Me and you.
00:07:12.432,00:07:13.850,What do you mean?
00:07:13.892,00:07:15.810,Look who you're walking with right now.
00:07:15.852,00:07:20.648,You should be up there calling the shots with the rest of the suits.
00:07:20.690,00:07:21.608,Yeah. So?
00:07:22.483,00:07:23.610,So?
00:07:25.070,00:07:27.864,Scofield is only here for one reason. His brother.
00:07:28.656,00:07:30.617,And he only needs two things.
00:07:30.658,00:07:33.494,The old man's money and the mob boss' plane.
00:07:40.501,00:07:43.504,You and the toilet.
00:07:43.546,00:07:45.548,"Exactly. And me, too."
00:07:45.590,00:07:48.551,"Yeah, we're just the damn laborers on this thing, man."
00:07:48.593,00:07:53.514,"And the night that Fish goes into that hole, you think he wants to carry all that extra baggage?"
00:07:53.556,00:07:55.642,'Cause that's all we are.
00:07:55.683,00:07:57.602,"I don't know about you, but I'm going."
00:08:01.189,00:08:07.404,"How much does he tell you, anyways, or does he keep it all to himself?"
00:08:12.451,00:08:15.536,You don't know what you're talking about.
00:08:15.578,00:08:19.582,"If he tells you everything, then you don't need him."
00:08:20.834,00:08:24.296,"Now, we can go ourselves."
00:08:26.840,00:08:31.219,"Or, you know, you can wait and see if Scofield really wants to carry heavy weight."
00:08:33.180,00:08:34.306,"It's up to you, papi."
00:08:42.814,00:08:43.857,Yo.
00:08:45.566,00:08:46.901,I'm still waiting.
00:08:46.943,00:08:50.571,"I swiped you that watch, man."
00:08:50.613,00:08:51.990,That's not gonna happen.
00:08:52.032,00:08:56.577,I said I'd think about it.
00:08:57.620,00:08:59.414,"Yeah, I ain't gonna hold my breath."
00:09:09.341,00:09:11.926,What do you want me to do?
00:09:11.968,00:09:13.928,"No, don't."
00:09:15.638,00:09:17.224,"We don't have a choice, okay?"
00:09:17.265,00:09:19.142,"Find it, find it, find it."
00:09:19.184,00:09:21.311,The bullet.
00:09:21.353,00:09:22.812,I can't.
00:09:51.216,00:09:52.800,BELLICK: Where is Scofield?
00:09:57.347,00:09:59.224,There you are.
00:10:00.850,00:10:03.228,Just looked for you in your cell.
00:10:03.270,00:10:05.688,"Couldn't find your credit card, either."
00:10:05.730,00:10:08.024,You know the one I'm talking about.
00:10:08.066,00:10:10.569,The one your whore wife trunked in the other day.
00:10:11.570,00:10:13.613,She told me all about it.
00:10:14.739,00:10:16.657,Maybe whore's too strong.
00:10:16.699,00:10:20.454,What do you call a girl who married a felon to get into the United States?
00:10:22.038,00:10:23.873,"What'd she have to come here for, anyway?"
00:10:23.915,00:10:27.294,No strip clubs in Whazitstan?
00:10:27.335,00:10:28.753,Captain.
00:10:28.795,00:10:31.005,"Would you mind conducting your inquisitions on your own time, please?"
00:10:31.047,00:10:33.383,I have a schedule to maintain.
00:10:33.425,00:10:40.599,I was just asking Mr. Scofield about the contraband he had his stripper wife trunk in the other day.
00:10:41.724,00:10:44.727,"But you go ahead, your job's more important."
00:10:58.199,00:11:00.701,He's had it out for me since the day I got here.
00:11:00.743,00:11:02.579,"Hold still, please."
00:11:15.342,00:11:18.470,I only married her so she could get her green card.
00:11:19.762,00:11:22.140,I saw you coming out of the conjugal room.
00:11:23.975,00:11:25.684,It's just business.
00:11:29.189,00:11:30.190,I know.
00:11:32.609,00:11:35.028,But I want to.
00:11:41.618,00:11:42.701,T-BAG: D.B.
00:11:44.371,00:11:47.582,"Oh, is that who you is now?"
00:11:47.624,00:11:50.168,"Take a couple of steps back, boy."
00:11:50.210,00:11:54.339,"You know, what I can't understand is why somebody like you wants to get out of here anyway."
00:11:54.381,00:11:58.759,"How you gonna survive, huh?"
00:11:58.801,00:12:01.888,They got computer phones.
00:12:01.929,00:12:04.765,You wouldn't know what to do.
00:12:04.807,00:12:07.519,"Oh, you're gonna have to."
00:12:12.899,00:12:14.150,Take your best shot.
00:12:14.192,00:12:16.735,"Hey, break it up down there!"
00:12:17.820,00:12:22.741,"Bow out, cowboy."
00:12:52.897,00:12:55.275,Records from the phone in the yard.
00:12:55.316,00:12:58.361,James Bagwell.
00:12:59.362,00:13:01.239,T-Bag's insurance policy?
00:13:01.281,00:13:06.453,My guy is gonna lock him up in a moving van for a couple of days until we're in the clear.
00:13:09.289,00:13:10.582,Don't worry.
00:13:10.624,00:13:12.959,He can breathe and all.
00:13:15.211,00:13:16.129,What about T-Bag?
00:13:17.130,00:13:20.091,He's no longer a threat.
00:13:38.901,00:13:41.820,You James Bagwell?
00:13:42.572,00:13:43.615,Yeah.
00:13:57.504,00:13:59.464,DOCTOR: Ma'am.
00:13:59.506,00:14:03.593,"Can I speak with you, please?"
00:14:03.635,00:14:05.886,VERONICA: Is he gonna be okay?
00:14:05.928,00:14:07.930,DOCTOR: We don't know yet.
00:14:07.972,00:14:10.600,"I was gonna call the police, but I wanted to speak with you first."
00:14:11.934,00:14:12.893,His wound is obviously the product of a gunshot.
00:14:12.935,00:14:15.104,You need to be honest with me.
00:14:15.146,00:14:18.065,What was he doing when he got shot?
00:14:18.107,00:14:22.737,He was in the garage underneath his car.
00:14:27.200,00:14:34.165,"He's also sustained a fair amount of damage to his shoulder and with a bullet, there's always an increased risk of infection, so he's gonna have to be admitted."
00:14:34.207,00:14:36.167,Is there anyone you should call?
00:14:36.209,00:14:37.960,No. It's just me.
00:14:38.002,00:14:42.089,"All right, well, I'll let you know as soon as he's in recovery."
00:14:59.982,00:15:02.109,Yeah?
00:15:02.151,00:15:03.319,Almost.
00:15:09.325,00:15:11.578,We want the trifecta today.
00:15:12.370,00:15:13.913,"Yeah, I'm on it."
00:15:27.343,00:15:28.762,It's me.
00:15:28.803,00:15:30.221,"MAGGIO: Yeah, I got bad news."
00:15:30.263,00:15:32.348,"Yeah, like what?"
00:15:35.894,00:15:37.353,The guy was paranoid.
00:15:37.395,00:15:39.313,One thing led to another.
00:15:39.355,00:15:42.275,"What, he's dead?"
00:15:42.316,00:15:46.487,"And, unfortunately, there was a kid there."
00:15:46.529,00:15:48.406,Yeah. What...
00:15:48.448,00:15:51.242,What are you talking about?
00:15:51.284,00:15:53.578,It was unintentional.
00:15:54.662,00:15:55.747,"It's a kid, man."
00:15:57.498,00:15:59.542,The SOB used him as a shield.
00:16:03.045,00:16:05.548,I don't know. Boy.
00:16:06.090,00:16:08.092,"Four, maybe five."
00:16:18.895,00:16:20.980,Who's here to see me?
00:16:25.526,00:16:26.778,Baby.
00:16:30.114,00:16:31.240,Hi.
00:16:32.074,00:16:33.033,You look so beautiful.
00:16:37.079,00:16:40.291,I came here 'cause I have to tell you something.
00:16:40.792,00:16:41.793,What?
00:16:42.877,00:16:44.003,"I'm pregnant, Fernando."
00:16:49.300,00:16:50.593,Pregnant?
00:16:52.219,00:16:53.888,With your baby.
00:16:56.098,00:16:58.058,I'm gonna have your son.
00:17:00.353,00:17:02.647,You... You're gonna...
00:17:03.648,00:17:05.024,We? We're gonna have a baby?
00:17:07.109,00:17:09.654,"Oye, papi, you hear that?"
00:17:09.696,00:17:12.740,I'm not finished.
00:17:12.782,00:17:16.452,"Okay. Hector, he asked me to marry him."
00:17:16.494,00:17:19.831,"Look, it's crazy, I know."
00:17:19.873,00:17:21.666,Tell him you're having my son.
00:17:21.708,00:17:23.001,Fernando.
00:17:29.924,00:17:32.760,And it's even harder if I do this by myself.
00:17:34.554,00:17:37.097,And all I know is I'm really scared.
00:17:37.139,00:17:39.099,I'm really scared to do this alone.
00:17:39.141,00:17:41.602,"You're not going to have to, baby."
00:17:41.644,00:17:44.647,"Well, I haven't told him no yet."
00:17:46.148,00:17:48.735,You're not actually considering this?
00:17:52.071,00:17:54.657,"My God, baby, you gotta stop listening to these people."
00:17:56.993,00:17:58.619,"Your hormone things, they're out of whack."
00:17:58.661,00:18:00.872,You're not thinking straight.
00:18:02.040,00:18:03.082,This is our child we're talking about.
00:18:05.626,00:18:07.921,I want you to listen to me.
00:18:09.422,00:18:13.051,I want you to wait.
00:18:14.301,00:18:16.763,You keep on telling me that.
00:18:18.347,00:18:21.308,C.O. PATTERSON: All right.
00:18:27.982,00:18:30.276,Tell me you're gonna wait.
00:18:30.317,00:18:32.779,"Hands off, Sucre."
00:18:35.239,00:18:38.659,"You're all I got left in the world, baby. Please."
00:18:42.204,00:18:43.539,I love you.
00:18:50.755,00:18:53.841,"Tell me you're gonna tell him no, honey."
00:18:54.717,00:18:56.260,I don't know.
00:19:06.687,00:19:08.731,"Sucre, come on."
00:19:25.748,00:19:28.793,The kid's here.
00:19:28.835,00:19:31.629,Follow him back to the lawyers.
00:20:27.018,00:20:30.229,Where you going?
00:20:31.731,00:20:34.400,What do you have to do?
00:20:35.484,00:20:37.737,"But if it works, you'll see soon enough."
00:20:39.321,00:20:41.199,I want to go with you.
00:20:41.240,00:20:43.534,Someone has to stay here.
00:20:43.576,00:20:46.954,I need a lookout.
00:20:46.996,00:20:51.042,You're my cellmate.
00:20:56.130,00:21:00.300,"I'll be back in 10 minutes, okay?"
00:21:00.342,00:21:01.802,Okay.
00:21:30.123,00:21:32.458,We're all lined up for tomorrow.
00:21:39.381,00:21:41.550,"Tomorrow, where do you want T-Bag?"
00:21:43.469,00:21:45.638,I don't care. You decide.
00:23:47.509,00:23:48.802,Are you okay?
00:23:49.511,00:23:51.055,"Yeah, I'm okay."
00:23:52.890,00:23:54.683,She didn't do anything.
00:23:55.976,00:23:58.604,She didn't deserve this.
00:24:08.030,00:24:10.408,"C.O.: All right, let's go, inmates."
00:24:14.870,00:24:16.330,"Here you go, man."
00:24:16.372,00:24:18.207,These were seriously hard to get.
00:24:18.249,00:24:21.668,"What you need them for, anyway?"
00:24:28.759,00:24:33.471,"Thank you for waiting, Theodore. I don't mean to deny your time in the yard."
00:24:34.807,00:24:37.184,What's this all about?
00:24:37.226,00:24:39.519,"I, uh..."
00:24:39.561,00:24:42.731,I'm afraid I have some terrible news.
00:24:44.482,00:24:48.528,Your cousin James was shot and killed in his home yesterday.
00:24:48.570,00:24:51.449,His son James Junior was killed as well.
00:24:55.577,00:24:57.037,"I'm very, very sorry."
00:25:05.879,00:25:07.547,What does it mean?
00:25:08.174,00:25:13.220,"Am I chosen, or what?"
00:25:14.388,00:25:18.516,Often the Lord appears when you're in particular need of forgiveness.
00:25:29.611,00:25:31.822,"John, it's never too late."
00:25:33.615,00:25:39.621,"If you agree to accept Christ into your heart and turn from your sin, he will forgive you and save you in eternity."
00:25:43.000,00:25:44.584,Do you agree?
00:25:56.055,00:26:00.017,"Jesus said, 'Behold, I stand at the door, and knock."
00:26:00.059,00:26:28.586,"'If any man hear my voice, and open the door, 'I will come in to him.' He got to the infirmary building last night through the old sewer pipe."
00:26:28.628,00:26:32.550,It's the same pipe that runs under the guard's room.
00:26:32.590,00:26:33.967,That's all I know.
00:26:38.055,00:26:41.016,GEARY: That's the little thumbsucker that swiped my watch.
00:26:41.058,00:26:43.727,"BELLICK: Who, Tweener?"
00:26:43.769,00:26:46.813,He took it right off my arm.
00:26:46.855,00:26:48.648,Whose was it in the first place?
00:26:48.690,00:26:50.401,I don't care that you stole it.
00:26:50.443,00:26:52.903,Michael Scofield.
00:27:14.800,00:27:17.386,I'll be right around the corner.
00:28:30.792,00:28:32.752,C.O. PATTERSON: Westmoreland.
00:28:43.972,00:28:45.724,Get back to work.
00:29:00.822,00:29:03.450,"All right, let's go!"
00:29:17.797,00:29:19.299,"Move it, Scofield."
00:29:31.853,00:29:36.734,"As for me, I will call upon God; and the Lord shall save me..."
00:29:41.614,00:29:43.949,He shall hear my voice.
00:29:43.990,00:29:46.952,He shall hear my voice.
00:29:52.874,00:29:54.627,He shall hear my voice.
00:30:27.117,00:30:28.910,SCOFIELD: What are you doing?
00:30:29.369,00:30:30.621,Nothing.
00:30:33.915,00:30:36.001,"Well, keep an eye on the tier for me, will you?"
00:30:37.919,00:30:41.881,When are we getting out of here exactly?
00:30:41.923,00:30:44.884,As soon as possible...
00:30:46.928,00:30:48.013,Why does he need to know and I don't?
00:30:48.054,00:30:50.015,Because he's arranging the plane.
00:30:50.056,00:30:51.850,Why the sudden curiosity?
00:30:55.895,00:31:00.693,Why would you want to be responsible for potentially dangerous information?
00:31:02.944,00:31:04.863,It's for your own good.
00:31:08.283,00:31:10.869,I have to go.
00:31:11.953,00:31:13.706,I'll meet you in PI.
00:31:23.965,00:31:25.925,Stealing from a guard?
00:31:25.967,00:31:28.428,You can get thrown in the SHU for that.
00:31:29.971,00:31:31.931,I don't know what you're talking about...
00:31:31.973,00:31:34.351,Don't deny it.
00:31:34.393,00:31:37.937,"Lucky for you, I got some pull around here."
00:31:37.979,00:31:42.901,"I can make this sort of thing go away, like it never even happened."
00:31:45.987,00:31:47.698,That's good.
00:31:49.533,00:31:58.124,"Now, I'm sure you've heard the word rat."
00:31:58.166,00:31:59.918,Snitch neither.
00:32:01.795,00:32:04.339,Those sort of words aren't appropriate for what I need from you.
00:32:04.381,00:32:06.884,What I need is a little information.
00:32:06.925,00:32:09.720,Like when you're hanging out with Scofield.
00:32:11.054,00:32:13.932,Just come back and tell me what he said.
00:32:20.689,00:32:22.524,I got an extra burger.
00:32:26.361,00:32:28.280,"But, man, I'm full."
00:32:29.030,00:32:30.574,"What do you say, kiddo?"
00:32:43.378,00:32:45.964,That's my boy.
00:32:48.550,00:32:51.970,"Hey, honey."
00:32:52.596,00:32:54.055,What's wrong?
00:32:54.890,00:32:57.225,I... I've been thinking.
00:32:58.727,00:33:00.938,I think we need to make a change.
00:33:01.730,00:33:02.856,What are you talking about?
00:33:06.067,00:33:06.944,"Yeah, we were 22."
00:33:08.361,00:33:10.906,"Well, maybe, we should give it a shot."
00:33:10.948,00:33:14.534,I don't understand.
00:33:15.076,00:33:16.662,It's just work.
00:33:16.703,00:33:24.002,I'm tired of being on the road and working for somebody else while you sit at home all alone night after night.
00:33:25.170,00:33:26.964,I want our lives to be about us.
00:33:30.550,00:33:32.010,We gotta go.
00:33:42.103,00:33:43.021,Ho.
00:33:43.939,00:33:45.691,Crowd has thinned out in here.
00:33:45.732,00:33:47.066,"How you doing, Sucre?"
00:33:49.110,00:33:51.070,"You're up, then Westmoreland."
00:33:51.112,00:33:55.033,We gotta get through.
00:36:48.289,00:36:50.709,"SARA: Okay, you go ahead and write that up."
00:37:16.234,00:37:18.236,Hello.
00:37:20.197,00:37:23.324,Who... Who is this?
00:37:23.366,00:37:25.744,Don't hang up.
00:37:25.785,00:37:29.247,I have information that you may be interested in.
00:37:30.999,00:37:33.292,Information that will lead to the exoneration of Lincoln Burrows.
00:37:33.334,00:37:36.254,What? What is it?
00:37:37.797,00:37:41.259,"Meet me tomorrow at the Highland Cafe, on Kennedy Avenue."
00:37:41.843,00:37:43.302,This isn't a trap.
00:37:43.344,00:37:45.263,I will... I will tell you everything you need to know.
00:37:46.056,00:37:47.682,"Highland Cafe, 8:00 p.m."
00:37:59.694,00:38:02.072,Leave us alone.
00:38:02.114,00:38:03.698,Get out of here.
00:38:13.833,00:38:16.294,You don't have to do this.
00:38:17.254,00:38:19.214,You don't have to do this.
00:38:20.257,00:38:22.300,You don't have to do this.
00:38:25.095,00:38:27.180,You brought it on yourself.
00:38:27.222,00:38:30.558,I'm just an emissary for all the pain and suffering you caused.
00:38:30.600,00:38:33.561,"All the families you ruined, all the kids."
00:38:33.603,00:38:36.231,What about Jimmy?
00:38:37.690,00:38:41.027,He had nothing to do with this.
00:38:41.069,00:38:42.654,And what about his beautiful son?
00:38:44.489,00:38:48.243,His whole life in front of him. You didn't need to kill a beautiful child.
00:38:50.578,00:38:52.956,"After all I've done, maybe I do deserve to die."
00:38:52.998,00:38:56.042,"Maybe I do, but you are no better than me."
00:38:56.084,00:38:58.920,"But I can be, if I want."
00:39:00.297,00:39:04.301,God has given me the chance to choose.
00:39:05.426,00:39:06.344,What?
00:39:07.637,00:39:11.183,And maybe I should give you a chance as well.
00:39:12.684,00:39:14.978,"Anything, anything. Please."
00:39:15.854,00:39:16.980,Please.
00:39:17.856,00:39:18.857,Please.
00:39:20.066,00:39:22.068,Back out.
00:39:27.073,00:39:28.491,Of the escape?
00:39:30.243,00:39:31.369,Or die.
00:39:33.454,00:39:34.914,I wouldn't...
00:39:37.042,00:39:39.211,I wouldn't make it out there anyway.
00:39:40.628,00:39:42.630,Not with my proclivities.
00:39:43.631,00:39:45.050,I want you... to give me your word.
00:39:50.555,00:39:53.391,You got it.
00:39:55.476,00:39:57.229,Swear?
00:39:59.064,00:40:00.398,I swear to God.
00:40:03.484,00:40:06.071,I swear. I swear.
00:40:10.950,00:40:12.410,All right. All right!
00:40:13.494,00:40:17.040,I have forgiven you.
00:40:20.501,00:40:24.881,You just have to pray that the Lord Jesus Christ will do the same.
00:40:55.161,00:40:56.996,I'm through.
00:40:57.038,00:40:59.665,"Come on, stomp it."
00:41:10.593,00:41:11.761,Bulls.
00:41:13.930,00:41:16.433,"SUCRE: Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry up. Come on, come on, come on."
00:41:16.474,00:41:17.600,"Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry."
00:41:17.642,00:41:20.228,WESTMORELAND: You gotta stall them.
00:41:23.148,00:41:25.524,"Hey, boss."
00:41:25.566,00:41:28.320,Taking a break.
00:41:28.361,00:41:32.157,It's all good.
00:41:33.574,00:41:35.201,Hey! Hey!
00:41:35.243,00:41:38.037,"What the hell's your problem, con?"
00:41:40.457,00:41:43.501,"Hey, hey, step off, or you're going to the SHU."
00:41:48.589,00:41:51.134,"Burrows, get off him!"
00:41:51.968,00:41:53.552,Get off of him.
00:41:53.594,00:41:55.513,Get off. Get up.
00:42:12.947,00:42:14.157,Thanks.
00:42:15.158,00:42:17.285,"Well, we leave tonight."
00:42:23.208,00:42:24.000,Where's my brother?
00:42:24.042,00:42:25.543,"Michael, we got a big problem."
00:00:07.090,00:00:09.969,The infirmary's the weakest link in the security chain.
00:00:11.094,00:00:12.721,TRUMPETS: These were seriously hard to get.
00:00:12.763,00:00:13.889,What you need them for anyway?
00:00:13.931,00:00:15.307,None of your business.
00:00:20.103,00:00:23.357,"Keep talking like that, I'm gonna be forced to put a bullet in your head."
00:00:28.069,00:00:31.949,I have information that will lead to the exoneration of Lincoln Burrows.
00:00:31.991,00:00:33.534,I gotta check the status in there.
00:00:37.120,00:00:38.163,Ouch!
00:00:39.581,00:00:42.083,GUARD: Get off of him.
00:00:42.125,00:00:43.042,Get up.
00:00:43.084,00:00:44.419,We leave tonight.
00:00:44.461,00:00:46.045,"Michael, we got a big problem."
00:00:53.637,00:00:54.638,Back out.
00:00:55.514,00:00:57.516,Of the escape?
00:01:05.106,00:01:06.107,"SARA: Stay with me, John."
00:01:08.151,00:01:10.111,We're almost there.
00:01:15.242,00:01:16.702,"You stay with me, John."
00:01:16.744,00:01:18.119,You stay with me.
00:01:18.161,00:01:19.663,Stay with me. Keep breathing.
00:01:19.705,00:01:21.289,All right? Can you do that?
00:01:24.167,00:01:25.335,"Almost there, almost there."
00:01:48.358,00:01:50.151,MAN: We got it.
00:01:52.195,00:01:55.156,His blood pressure's too low.
00:01:55.198,00:01:56.157,We gotta get him to Chicago.
00:01:56.199,00:01:58.118,Cook is a 20-minute flight.
00:02:02.205,00:02:03.123,"We gotta go, Doc."
00:02:23.060,00:02:25.980,And then there were six.
00:02:39.242,00:02:40.661,"Who's the tough guy now, huh?"
00:02:54.049,00:02:56.718,"SCOFIELD: Warden, where's my brother?"
00:02:57.636,00:02:58.679,"He's in a lot of trouble, son."
00:03:01.140,00:03:02.891,That's not a request I can grant at the moment.
00:03:07.437,00:03:09.606,We're 36 hours away from his execution.
00:03:09.648,00:03:11.441,He panicked.
00:03:11.483,00:03:16.864,"For that reason, for the rest of his time at Fox River, we're going to keep him in Ad Seg."
00:03:16.905,00:03:19.074,For his safety and everybody else's.
00:03:19.116,00:03:21.200,But I'm his brother.
00:03:21.242,00:03:24.038,It's not your right to see him.
00:03:21.242,00:03:27.041,"Until tomorrow, at his execution."
00:03:30.961,00:03:32.211,"I'm sorry, son."
00:04:14.213,00:04:15.964,The name is John Abruzzi.
00:04:16.006,00:04:18.383,A-B-R-U-Z-Z...
00:04:20.343,00:04:22.303,I don't care what protocol is.
00:04:24.056,00:04:25.891,Hello? Hello?
00:04:35.650,00:04:37.444,The hospital won't give out any information.
00:04:37.485,00:04:40.155,Wonder what happened to that boy.
00:04:44.367,00:04:45.911,We gotta put this whole thing on hold.
00:04:45.953,00:04:48.329,"Whoa, easy, Fish."
00:04:48.371,00:04:49.998,I don't think you heard me.
00:04:52.417,00:04:55.170,"God bless Sink, but the man is gone."
00:04:57.380,00:04:58.882,Not until they strap you up.
00:04:58.924,00:05:04.263,"If you think I'm going to leave my brother behind, you have massively underestimated me."
00:05:04.304,00:05:05.180,Really?
00:05:05.222,00:05:06.431,That ain't my fight.
00:05:08.016,00:05:12.104,"I'm through that hole, pretty, with or without you, next time I'm on PI."
00:05:16.399,00:05:18.152,"I think we should have the floor open to everybody else, huh?"
00:05:18.193,00:05:19.360,Let's see what they all say.
00:05:20.403,00:05:24.825,Every day we don't use that hole is another day the screws can find it.
00:05:26.409,00:05:27.452,We're clear to the infirmary.
00:05:27.494,00:05:29.329,That's all we need.
00:05:30.413,00:05:36.503,"Through that window, over that wire, over that wall."
00:05:40.299,00:05:42.301,"Oh, Fish, it's not just two."
00:05:45.637,00:05:48.389,"If it's now or never, we gotta go."
00:05:52.019,00:05:53.603,"They're grown men, Michael."
00:05:53.645,00:05:55.438,They can all decide for themselves.
00:05:55.480,00:05:57.941,You son of a...
00:05:57.983,00:06:00.359,Let go.
00:06:00.401,00:06:01.528,"Hey, it's good, boss, it's good."
00:06:01.569,00:06:03.362,Just playing around.
00:06:07.784,00:06:09.452,"Now, you know what?"
00:06:09.494,00:06:12.413,There are two things that everybody needs to get with here.
00:06:12.455,00:06:15.709,"First, hillbilly, you have got to learn some respect."
00:06:16.877,00:06:19.087,The man here made everything possible.
00:06:20.672,00:06:28.387,"And you, Fish, you're gonna have to get with that we are doing this thing this afternoon as soon as we get on PI."
00:06:29.681,00:06:34.435,So you're just gonna make a run for it in the middle of the day?
00:06:34.477,00:06:37.480,"Well, you gotta do what you gotta do, huh, baby?"
00:06:37.522,00:06:39.440,You are gonna screw this whole thing up.
00:06:44.988,00:06:48.867,"Now, this train is leaving the station, and I suggest you get on it."
00:06:48.909,00:06:50.660,"Get on the train, Fish."
00:06:50.702,00:06:52.662,Get on the train.
00:06:52.704,00:06:56.541,"Well, you know what, you sons of bitches?"
00:06:56.583,00:06:59.627,I won't let you do it.
00:07:06.593,00:07:08.427,He'll be back.
00:07:38.750,00:07:45.299,"Those guys, they go before us tonight, they use that hole, it's over."
00:07:46.216,00:07:48.802,CO's will turn this whole place upside down till they find it.
00:07:48.843,00:07:53.265,"Well, sounds like you're thinking about it."
00:07:54.182,00:07:56.559,I'd be lying if I said I wasn't.
00:07:57.769,00:07:59.687,I wanna be out of here yesterday.
00:08:00.605,00:08:02.274,"I got a kid coming, man."
00:08:06.820,00:08:08.613,"Michael, you can't get him out of there."
00:08:15.954,00:08:18.790,Can I say something?
00:08:18.832,00:08:23.753,"I know you're not gonna wanna hear it, but, uh, they're strapping him up either way now."
00:08:23.795,00:08:30.760,"Once he's gone, you'll be stuck here for another five years, and if they trace the hole back to you, they'll toss another dime."
00:08:30.802,00:08:34.264,"That's 15 years, papi."
00:08:38.852,00:08:42.397,"Of course, if I were you, I wouldn't leave my brother behind, either."
00:08:43.231,00:08:45.233,"Not to die like that, no."
00:08:45.275,00:08:46.818,Mmm-mmm.
00:08:48.069,00:08:51.948,Worst thing in the world they can do to a man is strap him to a chair like that.
00:09:08.256,00:09:09.757,We're in business.
00:09:09.799,00:09:12.719,I just spoke to a friend of mine who's a clerk at Superior Court.
00:09:12.760,00:09:15.555,"I told him about the informant, that you'd be seeing him at 8:00."
00:09:15.596,00:09:19.100,"He gives us any evidence that would warrant a stay, my friend said he'll hear us out."
00:09:19.142,00:09:19.809,We still might be able to stop this thing.
00:09:19.851,00:09:21.728,I gotta tell Lincoln.
00:09:21.769,00:09:23.938,"You go to that prison, they're gonna be all over you, you know that."
00:09:32.864,00:09:34.574,"What do you mean, big?"
00:09:35.367,00:09:36.826,You mean media big?
00:09:36.868,00:09:38.703,We got all the ammo we need.
00:09:38.745,00:09:41.415,There's a string of murders a mile long connected to this thing.
00:09:41.456,00:09:43.708,We expose that...
00:09:47.212,00:09:48.046,It's the bottom of the ninth.
00:10:12.487,00:10:13.780,DEDE: Hello?
00:10:14.822,00:10:17.200,Hey.
00:10:17.242,00:10:18.910,Daddy!
00:10:19.702,00:10:21.538,Daddy's on the phone.
00:10:22.622,00:10:23.915,How are the camels?
00:10:24.707,00:10:26.667,"Oh, well, the camels are..."
00:10:26.709,00:10:27.835,The camels are fine.
00:10:28.711,00:10:30.380,When do I get to see you?
00:10:31.005,00:10:32.549,Earlier than I thought.
00:10:33.550,00:10:34.926,Daddy said he's coming home soon.
00:10:34.968,00:10:37.720,"Hey, hey, put Mommy on the phone."
00:10:39.431,00:10:41.641,"Thank you, sweetie."
00:10:42.976,00:10:45.395,"First Sergeant Benjamin Miles Franklin, how are you?"
00:10:46.354,00:10:47.855,"Oh, baby."
00:10:48.898,00:10:52.569,"Just driving trucks, eating dates, trying to keep the sand out of my eyes."
00:10:52.611,00:10:55.196,I saw on the news the other day it was a 110 in Kuwait.
00:10:55.238,00:10:57.115,You must be melting over there.
00:10:57.740,00:10:59.200,You have no idea.
00:10:59.242,00:11:01.953,What's this I hear about you coming home soon?
00:11:01.995,00:11:03.955,"You're not getting your daughter's hopes up, are you?"
00:11:06.040,00:11:07.125,Sure.
00:11:08.168,00:11:10.003,Your man is coming home this week.
00:11:10.044,00:11:12.005,This week?
00:11:12.046,00:11:14.090,They said you were gonna be there for another year.
00:11:15.758,00:11:18.761,And the hell if I care where they came down from.
00:11:20.679,00:11:21.764,Only thing that matters is that we're gonna get to see each other.
00:11:24.351,00:11:25.477,"Thursday, Friday."
00:11:25.519,00:11:27.395,"Uh, I'm not sure, yet."
00:11:27.437,00:11:29.272,Oh my...
00:11:29.314,00:11:30.731,"Oh, no. No, no."
00:11:32.025,00:11:34.152,The Army's got that all arranged.
00:11:35.320,00:11:36.779,"You know, you just be waiting for me."
00:11:36.821,00:11:38.406,"Well, you know I got that down."
00:11:40.200,00:11:41.826,"INMATE: Today, C-Note."
00:11:43.244,00:11:45.038,"Whitey, back up."
00:11:47.666,00:11:51.503,"Hey, uh, you know, Com is only letting me use this linkup for a few more minutes."
00:11:51.545,00:11:55.423,"So, uh, uh, is Darius there?"
00:11:56.299,00:11:57.716,"Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'll go get him."
00:11:58.968,00:11:59.969,I love you.
00:12:05.808,00:12:07.018,DARIUS: Yo.
00:12:08.019,00:12:09.563,"Yo, what's up, Money?"
00:12:11.814,00:12:13.567,Your sister out of the room?
00:12:15.527,00:12:16.611,She is now.
00:12:19.822,00:12:21.782,Fox River all that they say it is?
00:12:21.824,00:12:23.535,"No, man, it ain't all that."
00:12:23.577,00:12:25.370,"Not for long, anyway."
00:12:25.412,00:12:26.787,What you mean by that?
00:12:26.829,00:12:28.707,I need you to do something for me.
00:12:28.747,00:12:30.166,"Yeah, all right."
00:12:31.167,00:12:32.293,You still driving that Escalade?
00:12:32.335,00:12:33.712,Is Michael Jackson still white?
00:12:34.962,00:12:36.214,"You got jokes, son."
00:12:36.881,00:12:38.091,How many does it hold?
00:12:42.721,00:12:44.097,Okay.
00:12:45.599,00:12:47.308,"Okay, what?"
00:12:49.977,00:12:51.187,Let's do it.
00:12:52.188,00:12:54.608,"What, you mean tonight?"
00:12:54.649,00:12:56.901,What about Linc?
00:13:01.448,00:13:02.699,"Michael, a razor blade ain't gonna get him out."
00:13:02.741,00:13:04.158,Do you have one or not?
00:13:08.204,00:13:09.788,"Careful, bro."
00:14:16.147,00:14:17.898,Thou shalt not kill!
00:14:17.940,00:14:19.066,Thou shalt not kill!
00:14:19.108,00:14:21.068,Thou shalt not kill!
00:14:22.487,00:14:25.281,LINCOLN: ...he leadeth me beside the still waters.
00:14:25.323,00:14:30.036,He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for your sake.
00:14:30.077,00:14:32.913,Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...
00:14:32.955,00:14:45.051,I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Surely goodness and mercy...
00:14:42.256,00:14:52.517,Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
00:14:53.309,00:14:54.268,Amen.
00:14:54.977,00:14:56.062,Amen.
00:14:59.357,00:15:01.234,"He does hear our prayers, you know, the Lord."
00:15:01.275,00:15:02.569,Yes.
00:15:02.610,00:15:04.404,On behalf of Lincoln.
00:15:06.947,00:15:10.910,All who seek forgiveness will be delivered.
00:15:10.951,00:15:12.328,Yes.
00:15:12.370,00:15:16.583,"If your brother accepts the Lord, he'll be free of this cage forever."
00:15:16.957,00:15:18.251,Yes.
00:15:20.920,00:15:23.464,I'll be available through this whole thing if you need me.
00:15:25.550,00:15:26.760,Reverend.
00:15:29.345,00:15:31.389,"Reverend, would you give this to my brother?"
00:15:34.975,00:15:37.311,It'd mean a lot to him knowing it came from me.
00:15:40.356,00:15:41.399,I will.
00:15:56.289,00:15:57.498,That was my mother's.
00:15:59.041,00:16:00.376,Tell her it's going to save someone a lot of pain.
00:16:02.670,00:16:04.380,You sure you know what you're doing?
00:16:06.591,00:16:08.384,It's in God's hands now.
00:16:13.473,00:16:18.519,It feels like you've been the clean-up crew for me the whole time I've been in here.
00:16:18.561,00:16:21.606,"Toes, contusions, insulin shots."
00:16:21.648,00:16:23.483,"Well, somebody's gotta do it."
00:16:24.567,00:16:26.235,"Well, I'm grateful."
00:16:26.694,00:16:30.448,"You ever think, in another life..."
00:16:31.324,00:16:32.617,"I won't be that woman, Michael."
00:16:32.659,00:16:34.243,I wasn't asking you to be.
00:16:36.454,00:16:38.372,But it is something to wonder about.
00:16:39.582,00:16:40.917,What if?
00:16:44.462,00:16:47.256,"Anyway, just wanted to make sure it was said."
00:16:53.095,00:16:54.639,I don't know.
00:16:54.681,00:16:58.434,"I guess in a place like this, you never know which day is gonna be your last."
00:17:02.480,00:17:03.940,"Sara, we got a backup out here."
00:17:03.982,00:17:04.816,Okay.
00:17:04.858,00:17:06.150,You're set.
00:17:08.361,00:17:10.446,"I, um..."
00:17:12.657,00:17:14.659,I'm sorry about your brother.
00:17:18.120,00:17:30.090,"Doctor, thank you."
00:18:20.641,00:18:22.727,"This is it, bro."
00:18:25.688,00:18:26.689,Hey.
00:18:32.779,00:18:34.822,Good luck to both of us.
00:18:34.864,00:18:36.699,PI!
00:18:36.741,00:18:38.117,Let's do it!
00:18:53.633,00:18:55.426,"Came to your senses, did you?"
00:18:59.722,00:19:04.184,"What, you figured some magic way to get your brother out of that hole and into the guards' room?"
00:19:04.226,00:19:06.145,He's not gonna be there.
00:19:13.235,00:19:14.862,Could you put the light on?
00:19:17.865,00:19:19.075,You okay?
00:19:21.535,00:19:22.912,"What do you think, Rev?"
00:19:25.247,00:19:28.208,I spoke with your brother today and he's been praying for you.
00:19:28.250,00:19:30.544,He must be desperate.
00:19:31.671,00:19:33.131,What about you?
00:19:33.172,00:19:34.715,Are you feeling desperate?
00:19:35.508,00:19:36.843,No.
00:19:37.468,00:19:38.761,Just for everyone else.
00:19:39.720,00:19:41.263,The ones you leave behind.
00:19:42.723,00:19:44.183,The ones I never got to say goodbye to.
00:19:49.271,00:19:50.690,Right up to the time.
00:19:52.274,00:19:53.860,Thank you.
00:19:54.694,00:19:57.905,"Uh, he wanted me to give this to you."
00:19:58.280,00:19:59.907,Michael.
00:20:12.294,00:20:14.047,PROTESTERS: Thou shalt not kill!
00:20:14.088,00:20:15.589,Thou shalt not kill!
00:20:15.631,00:20:19.259,Thou shalt not kill!
00:20:19.301,00:20:22.596,Thou shalt not kill!
00:20:22.638,00:20:26.059,Thou shalt not kill!
00:20:26.100,00:20:29.269,Thou shalt not kill!
00:20:29.311,00:20:32.398,Thou shalt not kill!
00:20:32.439,00:20:33.566,She's back in play.
00:20:33.607,00:20:36.235,Good. Who's there with you?
00:20:36.276,00:20:37.653,Tangren.
00:20:37.695,00:20:38.905,What about Hale?
00:20:40.531,00:20:43.868,He's supposed to be there.
00:20:43.910,00:20:46.245,I think it's a fairly concise term.
00:20:54.837,00:20:56.089,Don't get it.
00:21:00.843,00:21:01.677,What time's the flight?
00:21:01.719,00:21:03.345,11:00.
00:21:03.387,00:21:05.305,"Speaking of which, I gotta head up to Wrigleyville."
00:21:05.347,00:21:06.807,I'll be back in a couple of hours to collect you.
00:21:06.849,00:21:09.060,"Now, make sure you pack everything."
00:21:09.102,00:21:12.063,"Once we're out that door, we're not coming back."
00:21:12.105,00:21:13.231,What are you gonna do?
00:21:13.272,00:21:17.193,There's a letter I gotta deliver.
00:21:17.235,00:21:18.694,PROTESTERS: Thou shalt not kill!
00:21:20.362,00:21:22.322,We're about to go live...
00:21:22.364,00:21:24.408,My name's Veronica Donovan.
00:21:24.450,00:21:25.952,"Great, but this isn't the time for it."
00:21:25.993,00:21:27.245,"Ma'am, you're going to have to step aside."
00:21:27.286,00:21:28.662,"Uh, I'm sorry, Miss Donovan."
00:21:28.704,00:21:30.581,Did you say that you represent Lincoln Burrows?
00:21:30.623,00:21:31.832,That's right.
00:21:31.874,00:21:34.043,Angela West.
00:22:13.457,00:22:16.669,"So, Mr. Pied Piper, what's the play?"
00:22:16.710,00:22:18.963,We do what we always do.
00:22:19.005,00:22:20.965,Pretend to be working.
00:22:21.007,00:22:25.261,"Be model citizens, till the time comes."
00:22:25.303,00:22:26.470,And that'd be?
00:22:26.512,00:22:28.055,9:00.
00:22:29.056,00:22:32.018,"You seem to be forgetting the fact that PI shuts down at 5:00, pretty."
00:22:32.059,00:22:34.228,"We have to make sure it doesn't, don't we?"
00:22:46.824,00:22:48.826,Hammer.
00:22:54.207,00:22:56.374,"Whoa! What the hell are you doing, man?"
00:23:14.476,00:23:15.853,What the hell happened here?
00:23:15.895,00:23:17.771,Messed up. Hit a pipe.
00:23:19.106,00:23:20.816,Should have killed the water before we started.
00:23:20.858,00:23:22.235,"Should've, huh?"
00:23:22.276,00:23:24.778,It's not that big a deal.
00:23:24.820,00:23:28.199,I don't think mold should be a problem before then.
00:23:28.241,00:23:30.201,Mold?
00:23:30.243,00:23:33.287,"No, you shut up."
00:23:33.329,00:23:38.416,"You get drywall and insulation soaked like this, you run the risk of Stachybotrys mold."
00:23:40.044,00:23:43.214,"Boss, that's just like one time in a thousand, for real."
00:23:43.797,00:23:45.758,Tell you what.
00:23:45.799,00:23:53.807,You and all your companeros here aren't stepping outside this door until every damn molecule of water is out of this place.
00:23:53.849,00:23:55.726,It's gonna take all night.
00:23:55.768,00:23:57.895,"Well, then it's gonna take all night."
00:23:59.563,00:24:01.481,Don't catch a sniffle.
00:24:17.748,00:24:19.125,PROTESTERS: Free Burrows!
00:24:19.166,00:24:21.252,Free Burrows!
00:24:21.294,00:24:24.004,Great. Thanks.
00:24:24.046,00:24:25.505,MAN: Put her on.
00:24:25.547,00:24:28.175,"Miss Donovan, if you don't mind, we'd like to put you on."
00:24:28.217,00:24:30.136,That's why I'm here.
00:24:34.265,00:24:35.849,PROTESTERS: Free Burrows!
00:24:35.891,00:24:38.144,Free Burrows!
00:24:38.185,00:24:39.686,"Evening, Peter."
00:24:39.728,00:24:41.521,"I'm with Veronica Donovan, the lawyer for Lincoln Burrows."
00:24:41.563,00:24:43.316,"You're petitioning for a stay, is that right?"
00:24:43.357,00:24:44.233,That's right.
00:24:44.275,00:24:46.444,On what grounds?
00:24:46.484,00:24:48.821,On the grounds that my client's been framed.
00:24:48.862,00:24:50.448,Get specifics out of her.
00:24:50.488,00:24:53.033,"Miss Donovan, do you have any proof to that effect?"
00:24:53.075,00:24:55.161,There's a whole string of proof. Murders.
00:24:55.202,00:24:57.704,"Leticia Barris, a potential exculpatory witness."
00:25:00.166,00:25:04.211,"Bishop McMorrow, the man who could've petitioned the Governor for clemency."
00:25:04.253,00:25:05.712,You're saying someone's killing these people off?
00:25:08.506,00:25:10.343,What the truth about Terrence Steadman really was.
00:25:10.384,00:25:14.721,"Is this all just speculation, or is there hard evidence that can substantiate your claims?"
00:25:14.763,00:25:16.598,I have a source.
00:25:16.640,00:25:18.017,Get a name.
00:25:18.058,00:25:19.685,Could you elaborate on that?
00:25:19.726,00:25:23.189,But somebody on the inside claims they can exonerate Lincoln.
00:25:23.230,00:25:26.400,That Terrence Steadman wasn't even in the car that night.
00:25:26.442,00:25:28.194,Someone's been talking.
00:25:39.497,00:25:42.124,There a reason you're on direct current?
00:25:42.166,00:25:43.541,Sorry?
00:25:45.836,00:25:47.796,"Alternating current, direct current."
00:25:49.256,00:25:51.717,DC's kind of yesterday's news for this sort of thing.
00:25:58.140,00:25:59.557,Okay.
00:26:00.142,00:26:01.394,Let's see what we got.
00:26:08.566,00:26:10.777,You ready to run one?
00:26:44.602,00:26:46.772,"I think you better turn these lights on, Officer."
00:27:20.431,00:27:21.639,You okay?
00:27:24.477,00:27:26.686,LJ?
00:27:29.773,00:27:31.649,"He's scared, but he's good."
00:27:34.652,00:27:36.196,I found someone who's gonna talk.
00:27:37.739,00:27:39.074,"I don't know, but he knows things."
00:27:39.116,00:27:40.993,I'm gonna go meet him in a few hours.
00:27:41.034,00:27:43.078,"A few hours is cutting it close, V."
00:27:43.120,00:27:44.288,We don't have any other choice.
00:27:44.330,00:27:47.416,"You have to have faith, okay?"
00:27:48.750,00:27:50.210,Nick's already primed the court to hear our case.
00:27:51.753,00:27:54.340,"Whatever Michael's doing, he doesn't need to do it now."
00:27:55.673,00:27:57.092,We're going to beat this thing the right way.
00:27:59.219,00:28:00.387,And if you are?
00:28:01.096,00:28:02.348,"You gotta trust me, okay?"
00:28:15.402,00:28:16.820,Don't give up on me.
00:28:20.240,00:28:21.367,Promise?
00:28:44.806,00:28:46.183,"No, it's all right."
00:28:46.225,00:28:47.601,"Paul, how are you?"
00:28:47.643,00:28:48.768,I'm good. I'm good.
00:28:58.737,00:28:59.946,Where you going?
00:28:59.988,00:29:01.365,Vacation.
00:29:01.407,00:29:02.741,Bahamas.
00:29:03.992,00:29:06.745,"Packing kind of heavily for the Bahamas, aren't you?"
00:29:06.786,00:29:08.330,You know women.
00:29:08.372,00:29:09.331,Yeah.
00:29:10.541,00:29:15.045,"So, um, where's Danny?"
00:29:15.087,00:29:16.046,"Uh, running errands, I think."
00:29:16.088,00:29:18.424,"Errands, huh?"
00:29:18.840,00:29:19.799,"Where, uh..."
00:29:20.842,00:29:23.762,Where might those errands be?
00:29:38.860,00:29:41.113,"Louis, you there?"
00:29:42.155,00:29:43.657,"PATTERSON: Yeah. Yeah, I'm here, Linc."
00:29:43.699,00:29:45.200,What time you got?
00:29:48.120,00:29:49.329,A little after 8:00.
00:30:12.311,00:30:13.562,It's 8:15.
00:30:34.416,00:30:35.626,You okay?
00:30:37.419,00:30:39.421,No.
00:31:06.323,00:31:08.325,"Michael, what have you done to me?"
00:31:08.367,00:31:10.952,"Oh, God!"
00:31:43.610,00:31:44.903,Showtime.
00:31:48.281,00:31:49.575,"Let's go, man."
00:32:04.464,00:32:06.966,Tancredi leave yet?
00:32:07.008,00:32:08.927,"No, I don't think so."
00:32:09.595,00:32:11.263,You better call her.
00:32:40.500,00:32:43.253,See you on the other side.
00:33:03.064,00:33:06.443,"Well, everything tells me it's food poisoning."
00:33:06.485,00:33:16.411,"Which means you should be feeling better in a couple of hours, but, uh, I wish I could say that this would be enough to forestall the execution."
00:33:16.453,00:33:17.871,But it's not gonna be.
00:33:17.913,00:33:19.539,It's all right.
00:33:20.123,00:33:21.750,"I can stay with you, if you want."
00:33:24.544,00:33:25.378,No.
00:33:27.798,00:33:30.258,It's fine. Thank you.
00:33:30.383,00:33:31.510,Okay.
00:34:05.084,00:34:08.881,"Your boyfriend, he can still be saved."
00:34:13.635,00:34:15.721,Burrows was chosen a long time ago.
00:34:15.762,00:34:17.472,Hand-picked to be an assassin.
00:34:18.724,00:34:20.266,But he never pulled the trigger.
00:34:20.726,00:34:22.101,Who did?
00:34:22.978,00:34:24.688,Come on.
00:34:24.730,00:34:27.691,Who killed Terrence Steadman?
00:34:28.233,00:34:29.484,Nobody.
00:34:30.235,00:34:31.444,What?
00:34:31.486,00:34:32.988,Terrence Steadman's still alive.
00:34:35.156,00:34:37.659,There's three sheets of paper inside.
00:34:41.955,00:34:45.625,"Everyone that started this whole thing, from top to bottom."
00:34:49.170,00:34:50.839,"You need to take two steps that way, right now."
00:34:52.632,00:34:53.926,"Behind the car, get behind the car."
00:34:53.967,00:34:56.469,"You want to stay alive, do as I say. Now."
00:35:18.533,00:35:20.035,"Your boys better be there, rughead."
00:35:21.202,00:35:22.829,"They'll be there, Cletus."
00:35:33.757,00:35:35.634,This is crazy.
00:35:51.232,00:35:54.527,"So, uh, what are we doing here, Danny?"
00:35:58.239,00:35:59.574,Where's the lawyer?
00:35:59.616,00:36:01.493,I don't know what you're talking about.
00:36:01.534,00:36:03.202,Allison told me.
00:36:04.037,00:36:06.205,I got it out of her.
00:36:06.247,00:36:07.457,You didn't touch her?
00:36:07.499,00:36:09.208,Why would I do that?
00:36:09.250,00:36:11.628,"We're partners, right?"
00:36:11.837,00:36:12.963,No.
00:36:14.631,00:36:16.257,Allison's fine.
00:36:18.802,00:36:22.263,"Well, I guess you're going to have to ask yourself who you want to give up."
00:36:27.226,00:36:28.186,Just tell me where she is.
00:36:29.270,00:36:30.897,Is she here? Has she been...
00:36:32.273,00:36:34.818,What exactly have you told...
00:36:40.281,00:36:42.241,Give me your gun.
00:36:42.283,00:36:43.952,"Yes, you can."
00:36:45.037,00:36:46.872,"I give you a command, you obey it."
00:36:49.624,00:36:51.334,Give me your gun.
00:36:57.799,00:37:00.635,"Paul, it's nothing."
00:37:00.677,00:37:02.220,Back up.
00:37:20.321,00:37:22.323,It's amazing.
00:37:20.321,00:37:24.951,You got it all on only three pages.
00:37:26.452,00:37:29.288,You know what would happen if this fell into the wrong hands?
00:37:39.340,00:37:40.675,You named me?
00:37:43.261,00:37:44.971,"I got scared, man."
00:37:45.013,00:37:46.431,You named me!
00:37:46.472,00:37:49.101,Danny?
00:37:52.687,00:37:55.273,"Paul, you and me, we--we've been friends since the academy."
00:38:06.118,00:38:07.285,You named me.
00:38:53.414,00:38:55.125,Okay. Let's go!
00:38:58.128,00:38:59.754,"Hey, hey, hey."
00:38:59.796,00:39:01.380,What you doing?
00:39:01.422,00:39:03.341,"Hey, yo-yo."
00:39:07.428,00:39:09.055,You can't park here.
00:39:10.098,00:39:12.309,"Yo, you think we meant to park here?"
00:39:17.272,00:39:20.358,Put you hands where I can see them.
00:39:23.028,00:39:24.821,I said put your hands where I can see them!
00:39:37.458,00:39:39.127,All fixed.
00:39:40.212,00:39:41.754,"What do you say, you two hit the road?"
00:39:45.466,00:39:51.223,"You two hit the road right now, or we're gonna have a problem."
00:40:13.494,00:40:15.413,Come on.
00:40:22.503,00:40:24.422,You all right?
00:40:42.690,00:40:44.234,They replaced it.
00:40:52.533,00:40:53.785,Michael?
00:40:54.535,00:40:56.454,He's there.
00:41:00.750,00:41:02.543,He's there.
00:41:14.013,00:41:15.473,You ready?
00:41:43.626,00:41:45.503,Ready?
00:42:13.739,00:42:15.492,What? Talk to me.
00:42:21.622,00:42:23.208,I'm so sorry.
00:42:32.133,00:42:34.219,We're not getting out of here.
00:42:37.638,00:42:42.601,"Unfortunately, pretty, that ain't an option."
00:00:02.002,00:00:03.879,My name is Michael Scofield.
00:00:03.921,00:00:08.049,"My brother is facing the electric chair, framed for a crime he didn't commit."
00:00:08.091,00:00:11.553,What is it about this case that the Secret Service is so interested in?
00:00:11.595,00:00:13.388,The man killed the Vice President's brother.
00:00:15.098,00:00:19.102,"SCOFIELD: After his appeals were exhausted, I knew there was only one way to get him out."
00:00:21.146,00:00:22.439,This is the police.
00:00:28.362,00:00:29.864,I'm getting you out of here.
00:00:29.905,00:00:31.156,It's impossible.
00:00:31.198,00:00:33.033,"Not if you designed the place, it isn't."
00:00:35.118,00:00:36.662,I've got them on me.
00:00:38.121,00:00:40.040,SCOFIELD: I've been at Fox River nearly a month now.
00:00:40.081,00:00:45.212,"In that time, I've assembled a group that has all the resources we need to not only break out, but to stay out."
00:00:45.253,00:00:46.672,"I'm Michael, by the way."
00:00:46.714,00:00:48.757,Dr. Tancredi...
00:00:54.054,00:00:57.641,MAN: I have information that will lead to the exoneration of Lincoln Burrows.
00:00:57.683,00:01:00.101,Somebody on the inside claims they can exonerate Lincoln.
00:01:00.143,00:01:02.062,Someone's been talking.
00:01:02.103,00:01:05.148,Anyone that's a threat is expendable.
00:01:15.158,00:01:18.037,"SCOFIELD: 24 hours from now, my brother is scheduled to die."
00:01:18.078,00:01:23.124,"But the way I see it, 24 hours from now, we'll be out of the country."
00:01:23.166,00:01:23.959,He's there.
00:01:33.092,00:01:34.093,We're not getting out of here.
00:01:37.765,00:01:40.017,"Unfortunately, pretty, that ain't an option."
00:01:55.156,00:01:58.493,"Unless you're gonna use your shank to take out the pipe, put it away."
00:02:01.204,00:02:02.122,"Bring it down a peg, T-Bag."
00:02:02.163,00:02:03.290,Shut your mouth!
00:02:05.208,00:02:09.088,"Remember, pretty, I am serving life plus one."
00:02:10.213,00:02:13.050,"So if I get busted for attempted escape, I'm gonna throw in a homicide, no problem."
00:02:13.092,00:02:15.886,That's like a parking ticket to me.
00:02:25.062,00:02:26.229,You okay?
00:02:26.271,00:02:28.189,Felt sick again.
00:02:28.231,00:02:29.650,"Yeah, you took your IV's out."
00:02:36.239,00:02:38.199,Just let me walk this off.
00:02:38.241,00:02:41.954,"Lincoln, there is no reason for you to be here if your IV isn't in."
00:02:43.246,00:02:45.124,Everything all right in here?
00:02:46.249,00:02:48.418,Why isn't he cuffed to the table?
00:02:48.460,00:02:51.130,"What's he gonna do, steal a cotton ball?"
00:02:52.422,00:02:54.173,"Can't have him walking around, Doc."
00:03:11.274,00:03:13.068,What was that?
00:03:13.110,00:03:14.193,C.O.: Put your wrist out.
00:03:16.030,00:03:17.614,You gonna turn this into something?
00:04:14.922,00:04:17.216,"Hey, Keith, come check this out!"
00:04:20.928,00:04:22.930,Keith?
00:04:29.937,00:04:32.940,We got to go. Now.
00:04:33.481,00:04:34.524,Give me the rope.
00:04:38.403,00:04:40.030,Give me the rope now!
00:04:43.158,00:04:45.493,Tie that off.
00:04:47.913,00:04:49.289,"Let's just stay here, okay?"
00:04:59.591,00:05:01.218,"WESTMORELAND: Okay, I'm down."
00:05:10.393,00:05:12.312,"We gotta go, Michael."
00:05:14.815,00:05:16.316,Get down. Let's go.
00:05:29.871,00:05:33.458,Did it break off or did someone break it?
00:05:33.500,00:05:35.085,I don't know.
00:06:24.467,00:06:25.552,"Hey, hey."
00:06:25.593,00:06:28.513,"What's up, Brad?"
00:06:28.555,00:06:31.350,It's two-for Tuesday.
00:06:34.477,00:06:36.395,Wuss. Anybody else?
00:06:38.439,00:06:40.025,Suit yourselves.
00:06:46.489,00:06:48.449,Ain't none of the Sheetrock in front of the break room been touched.
00:06:48.491,00:06:51.245,"Oh, the PI's are letting it dry out."
00:06:51.286,00:06:52.411,Still?
00:07:38.625,00:07:39.709,Westmoreland!
00:07:39.751,00:07:41.378,WESTMORELAND: I'm caught on something.
00:07:42.462,00:07:44.298,"Come on, come on, come on, come on!"
00:07:59.396,00:08:01.898,Stay there!
00:08:12.575,00:08:14.244,Why was this door locked?
00:08:14.286,00:08:17.956,"It wasn't locked, boss."
00:08:17.998,00:08:20.208,"So we just had to wedge it, uh, closed."
00:08:23.962,00:08:25.797,You've been in here all night not doing a damn thing.
00:08:25.839,00:08:28.467,"The room is still wet, boss."
00:08:28.508,00:08:30.510,It's not like we've been having a picnic.
00:08:31.594,00:08:34.014,"Bunch of shiftless, no-good convicts."
00:08:45.066,00:08:46.567,Wrap it up.
00:08:46.609,00:08:48.611,"And all four of you, get your asses back to the block."
00:08:55.618,00:08:56.619,Hey!
00:08:58.079,00:09:01.082,Get these nitwits back to the cell block.
00:09:16.556,00:09:17.849,You seem to be one light.
00:09:22.645,00:09:23.855,"Right here, boss."
00:09:35.492,00:09:37.577,"No, no. No way!"
00:09:46.503,00:09:47.462,Let's go.
00:09:54.761,00:09:56.263,Now!
00:10:39.931,00:10:41.766,C.O.: Keep it moving.
00:10:43.726,00:10:45.353,"Go, ladies."
00:10:48.856,00:10:50.650,Do you think he knows?
00:11:10.753,00:11:13.548,"Warden Pope, can you tell me what's gonna happen in the next few hours?"
00:11:13.590,00:11:18.637,There are strict Department of Corrections guidelines that govern every aspect of an execution.
00:11:18.677,00:11:21.722,Measures taken to make sure that the process goes as smoothly as possible.
00:11:21.764,00:11:23.183,Such as?
00:11:29.814,00:11:31.732,And Mr. Burrows himself.
00:11:31.774,00:11:34.235,What are his thoughts in these final hours?
00:11:35.403,00:11:37.489,I'd say that's between him and his God.
00:11:38.781,00:11:41.742,I understand Burrows' attorneys are going to request a stay.
00:11:41.784,00:11:42.743,I wish them the best of luck.
00:11:58.801,00:12:08.769,And we will be here with you throughout the night watching and waiting to see if Lincoln Burrows does in fact become only the 13th person to be executed in the state of Illinois since 1976.
00:12:20.574,00:12:25.620,"Just so you got one less thing to worry about, I want you to know I ain't mad at you."
00:12:30.917,00:12:32.001,Thank you.
00:12:34.837,00:12:35.796,How long until...
00:12:38.299,00:12:39.758,Are his lawyers making any progress?
00:12:41.844,00:12:43.555,No.
00:12:43.597,00:12:46.015,There's only one person who can really stop this execution.
00:13:17.714,00:13:18.797,Hey.
00:13:23.802,00:13:24.721,Just to talk.
00:13:24.763,00:13:26.723,For five minutes.
00:13:27.599,00:13:28.807,Yeah. Yeah. I'll try.
00:13:54.917,00:13:55.918,Um...
00:13:57.920,00:14:01.716,I'm sorry. I'm-- I'm told that you have to wait until final visitation.
00:14:01.758,00:14:04.927,"Would you talk to your father for me, please?"
00:14:13.394,00:14:15.605,Sara...
00:14:15.647,00:14:16.648,Um...
00:14:18.274,00:14:21.695,This isn't about the morality of the death penalty.
00:14:22.945,00:14:29.786,"This is about killing an innocent man, my brother, and surely your father can't be in favor of that."
00:14:29.828,00:14:33.873,"Just talk to Lincoln's attorneys, just for an hour, and I swear to God you'll be convinced of his innocence."
00:14:34.582,00:14:46.720,"Michael, I would pick up the phone right now if I thought there was any chance that I could make a difference, but you have to understand, I'm the last person in the world that my father listens to."
00:14:46.761,00:14:50.056,"He hates what I do, he hates what I believe in."
00:14:50.097,00:14:53.893,"And if I'm the one asking for clemency for your brother, your brother won't get it."
00:15:23.256,00:15:27.093,"Look, if Terrence Steadman is still alive, Lyle, then it can't be Terrence Steadman buried in the ground."
00:15:27.134,00:15:29.970,"Yeah, but a secret informant claims that Steadman is still alive?"
00:15:30.012,00:15:31.972,"I don't know, Nick."
00:15:32.014,00:15:34.058,"You're his clerk, just get us on the docket."
00:15:34.100,00:15:40.857,"Nick, you're asking him to commit political suicide by granting a stay of execution to Illinois' most notorious death row inmate."
00:15:40.899,00:15:43.526,"Officially, all we're asking is for an exhumation order."
00:15:43.568,00:15:45.695,"If he grants it, he can order a stay until the tests come in."
00:15:45.737,00:15:46.738,An exhumation order?
00:15:46.780,00:15:48.989,"Oh, well, that's better."
00:15:49.031,00:15:51.117,Digging up the Vice President's brother.
00:15:51.158,00:15:54.161,"Lyle, Lyle, look, we took Intro to Civ Pro together, remember?"
00:15:54.203,00:15:58.999,"We studied for the Bar day and night in that crappy little apartment of yours, talking about how we were going to make a difference."
00:15:59.041,00:16:02.879,"Nick, you filed an 11th-hour motion, and Judge Kessler's docket is full this afternoon."
00:16:02.921,00:16:05.965,"Come on, Lyle, everyone knows you run that courtroom."
00:16:06.006,00:16:08.217,You can't adjust things around a bit?
00:16:08.259,00:16:11.345,"The informant that was killed yesterday, I was there."
00:16:12.054,00:16:16.601,"I know firsthand, these people will do whatever they can to frame Lincoln for Steadman's murder."
00:16:18.352,00:16:20.730,All we're asking is to be heard.
00:16:24.943,00:16:27.027,"I'll give you 15 minutes this afternoon, that's it."
00:16:27.069,00:16:28.362,Thank you.
00:16:28.404,00:16:29.739,"Yeah, you're welcome."
00:16:41.000,00:16:43.043,He doesn't even know what happened.
00:16:43.085,00:16:43.837,He knows you tried.
00:16:43.878,00:16:45.045,Do you think so?
00:16:45.087,00:16:46.923,He's your brother.
00:16:48.090,00:16:50.927,SCOFIELD: I promised I would get him out of here.
00:16:50.969,00:16:52.887,"You promised a lot of people, pretty."
00:16:52.929,00:16:54.347,"Enough, man, all right?"
00:16:57.475,00:16:59.853,You don't get a man's hopes up like that and then just...
00:17:07.109,00:17:09.863,"C.O.: All right, ladies, rec time is over."
00:17:09.904,00:17:11.155,Back on the block!
00:17:15.994,00:17:17.244,And I will collect.
00:17:27.129,00:17:28.923,Thanks.
00:17:30.132,00:17:32.844,"Look, I know you were counting on this, so..."
00:17:32.886,00:17:34.637,Let me worry about my problems.
00:17:34.679,00:17:37.056,'Cause I know you've got enough on your mind right now.
00:17:38.140,00:17:46.065,"For what it's worth, over the years, I've known a few men who've sat on that chair, and as the day gets near, all you can really do is pray it goes quick."
00:17:47.149,00:17:54.073,"Once, about 10 years ago, there was a man caught a few sparks, not enough to do the job."
00:17:54.114,00:17:58.118,Had to wait another three weeks while they reset the whole process.
00:17:58.160,00:18:06.878,"And it may sound crazy, but he said it was the worst three weeks of his life, because it's not the lightning that kills you, it's the wait."
00:18:06.920,00:18:10.840,"So, take solace in the fact that your brother's wait is over."
00:18:15.845,00:18:18.056,There's a lot of protocol in killing a man.
00:18:21.183,00:18:23.394,A lot can happen in three weeks.
00:18:26.188,00:18:27.440,Thanks.
00:18:39.201,00:18:40.119,"Go, keep it together!"
00:18:44.665,00:18:45.959,I'm going in.
00:18:48.044,00:18:49.295,It's daytime.
00:18:51.047,00:18:53.132,I'll hang a sheet.
00:19:26.874,00:19:30.962,Do you have any questions about what's gonna happen tonight?
00:19:32.254,00:19:38.469,"When I get to eat, when I'm supposed to walk, how it's gonna feel when they tighten the belts."
00:19:38.511,00:19:40.513,Any of that gonna help come midnight?
00:19:41.889,00:19:43.975,Some feel it's best to be prepared.
00:19:44.934,00:19:46.268,How's Michael?
00:19:47.145,00:19:48.146,He's anxious to see you.
00:19:50.106,00:19:52.066,"Unfortunately, we've been told that that's not possible until final visitation."
00:19:57.279,00:19:59.032,You've been through this before?
00:19:59.657,00:20:01.200,No.
00:20:02.660,00:20:09.083,"Uh, just so you know, a doctor needs to be present, so, for what it's worth, I'll be there tonight."
00:20:09.125,00:20:10.877,Can I ask a favor?
00:20:10.918,00:20:12.003,Yeah. What?
00:20:12.045,00:20:17.216,"When I'm gone, can you look out for my brother?"
00:20:55.295,00:20:57.256,What were you doing back there?
00:21:03.846,00:21:05.181,Hmm.
00:21:05.223,00:21:06.432,"So you like doing that, too?"
00:21:06.473,00:21:07.975,Dipping a fry in the shake?
00:21:08.017,00:21:09.102,Hmm.
00:21:10.228,00:21:11.854,Good times. Good times.
00:21:11.896,00:21:15.274,So what's going on out there?
00:21:16.525,00:21:18.111,"Nothing, you know, just staying out of trouble."
00:21:18.152,00:21:22.406,I meant in terms of any office gossip you might have for me.
00:21:25.826,00:21:28.328,This one fool has been trying to cop a joint.
00:21:28.370,00:21:30.164,"So, I'll keep ear-hustling for that."
00:21:32.917,00:21:34.668,We had an agreement.
00:21:34.710,00:21:36.503,You were supposed to bird-dog Scofield and get back to me.
00:21:38.005,00:21:39.339,"I been trying, man, I've been working the corners."
00:21:39.381,00:21:41.175,Trust me.
00:21:41.217,00:21:43.886,"I seen you talking to him in the yard, him and the geezer."
00:21:43.928,00:21:46.055,"Yeah, I--I talked to Scofield, but he ain't told me nothing."
00:21:50.392,00:21:52.019,"Boss, you know I ain't got no money."
00:21:52.061,00:21:54.063,Then you better start selling your ass.
00:21:54.105,00:21:59.652,"100 bucks by the end of the shift, or there's gonna be a bidding war to see who gets you as their new cellie."
00:21:59.693,00:22:00.820,Beat it.
00:22:15.626,00:22:20.298,"In the yard today, I did hear Scofield say something."
00:22:20.881,00:22:22.091,And?
00:22:24.260,00:22:30.516,"He said if something goes wrong with the chair, his brother gets three more weeks to live."
00:22:35.437,00:22:37.940,We're square.
00:23:01.922,00:23:02.882,How's it going in here?
00:23:02.923,00:23:05.051,Ready for liftoff.
00:23:06.468,00:23:07.845,I already did.
00:23:06.468,00:23:09.972,The electrical contractor signed off on the diagnostic this morning.
00:23:10.014,00:23:11.974,We're good to go.
00:23:13.475,00:23:14.476,Run it.
00:23:23.443,00:23:24.695,It ain't working.
00:23:36.207,00:23:41.045,"So once they redo all the paperwork, your brother gets three more weeks."
00:23:41.087,00:23:43.047,"So we got time, then."
00:23:43.089,00:23:44.798,Are we still going through the infirmary?
00:23:48.302,00:23:49.762,You got another way?
00:23:49.803,00:23:52.306,Right now I'm just worried about getting through tonight.
00:24:10.199,00:24:12.450,"Careful. There's 2,000 volts running through that thing."
00:24:16.538,00:24:17.455,"Oh, God."
00:24:24.004,00:24:27.216,I came in here a man.
00:24:27.258,00:24:30.468,I came in here a man.
00:24:30.510,00:24:31.762,I came in here a man...
00:24:33.264,00:24:35.808,I came in here...
00:24:49.487,00:24:50.572,I want to see my brother.
00:24:50.614,00:24:52.408,When we move you to final visitation.
00:24:53.742,00:24:55.286,Right after we do this.
00:24:57.495,00:24:59.206,Just...
00:25:01.583,00:25:03.252,"It's your last day, Linc."
00:25:04.753,00:25:10.092,"I'd prefer to keep you out of cuffs as much as possible, but I need some assurances."
00:25:12.594,00:25:15.014,"You've always been straight up with me, Stolte."
00:25:15.681,00:25:16.849,You have my word.
00:25:26.192,00:25:33.782,"VERONICA: Your Honor, from the outset, Mr. Burrows' case has been tainted by conspiracy characterized by destruction of evidence, distortion of the truth and witness intimidation."
00:25:33.824,00:25:36.035,"Again, Judge, I have to object."
00:25:38.287,00:25:41.915,No proof?
00:25:41.957,00:25:43.209,You got me.
00:25:43.250,00:25:48.381,"Judge Kessler, Mr. Tucci might not appreciate the weight of what we've just presented, but surely you must."
00:25:48.422,00:25:56.596,"As Miss Donovan stated, a top video forensic analyst has disputed the authenticity of a surveillance tape that was the key piece of evidence in convicting Lincoln Burrows."
00:25:56.638,00:25:58.598,"That's the tape that no longer exists, right?"
00:26:00.558,00:26:05.398,"Unless my client is a rusted water pipe in the County Records Office, I'm afraid you're mistaken."
00:26:05.439,00:26:09.818,"Judge, Miss Donovan's apartment was blown up in an attempt to silence both her and me."
00:26:09.860,00:26:13.113,"That was independently corroborated as a gas leak, Your Honor."
00:26:13.155,00:26:18.576,"Judge, a month ago, a Secret Service agent named Paul Kellerman visited my office."
00:26:18.618,00:26:25.625,"I saw Kellerman last night, when he shot and killed another agent, Daniel Hale, right after Hale told me that Terrence Steadman was alive and well."
00:26:25.667,00:26:30.588,"Your Honor, I'm presenting to the clerk an affidavit from the director of the Secret Service Agency."
00:26:45.229,00:26:52.027,"The only witness to this alleged murder is Veronica Donovan, Lincoln Burrows' ex-girlfriend."
00:26:54.696,00:26:55.613,Save it.
00:26:55.655,00:26:59.659,But desperation causes desperate acts.
00:26:59.701,00:27:01.161,"And that's what we're seeing here today, Your Honor."
00:27:05.249,00:27:07.209,Judge Kessler.
00:27:07.251,00:27:11.297,Do either of you have any evidence that is admissible?
00:27:11.338,00:27:13.673,Even just tangible?
00:27:13.715,00:27:15.551,"Your claims, if true, are terrifying."
00:27:15.593,00:27:20.764,"But anything or anyone that could verify your story is either gone, missing or dead."
00:27:27.729,00:27:29.731,I'll reserve judgment for now.
00:27:29.773,00:27:34.945,"I'll take your arguments into consideration, and I'll have a decision within a few hours."
00:27:40.993,00:27:45.122,"These little bastards are the bane of my existence, I swear to God."
00:27:45.164,00:27:46.415,You get this a lot?
00:27:46.457,00:27:52.505,"Yeah, they're attracted to the heat when they're cold, plus, they got collapsible vertebrae or some deal, so they can squeeze through a crack yea big, if they're determined."
00:27:52.546,00:27:54.298,And he shorted out the wire just by biting on it?
00:27:54.340,00:28:01.555,"Not by chewing on the wire alone, but if the tail touches metal, it acts as a ground, and boom, fuse pops."
00:28:02.764,00:28:03.890,Along with the rat.
00:28:03.932,00:28:04.766,I'll be damned.
00:28:04.808,00:28:06.893,"So, can you change the fuse?"
00:28:08.770,00:28:10.523,Can you do it now?
00:28:12.191,00:28:14.485,"Now, hold up a minute."
00:28:14.985,00:28:16.736,Both of you.
00:28:18.656,00:28:22.535,We're gonna give more time to a guy who killed the Vice President's brother?
00:28:23.661,00:28:24.744,This guy's a terrorist.
00:28:24.786,00:28:26.288,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:28:26.330,00:28:28.748,"Forget about losing our jobs, we could all face charges."
00:28:28.790,00:28:30.417,Only the three of us know.
00:28:31.377,00:28:33.337,Real easy to keep it that way.
00:28:41.345,00:28:43.639,It's your guys' call.
00:28:50.229,00:28:51.771,How much longer?
00:28:51.813,00:28:52.898,Six hours.
00:28:52.939,00:28:53.899,C.O.: Open on 40!
00:28:59.112,00:29:03.783,"Scofield, your brother's gonna be transported to final visitation soon."
00:29:08.664,00:29:09.748,You look surprised.
00:29:10.832,00:29:12.626,You knew it was scheduled today.
00:29:18.591,00:29:19.758,"No, I..."
00:30:01.216,00:30:05.721,They'll be transporting you to final visitation in a minute.
00:30:09.141,00:30:11.518,"Thanks for keeping your word, Linc."
00:30:40.922,00:30:43.925,"Linc, you're gonna have to change into these."
00:30:44.926,00:30:46.720,What's that?
00:30:46.762,00:30:49.931,"At the moment of death, the body becomes incontinent, so..."
00:30:50.599,00:30:51.767,It's a diaper?
00:30:51.809,00:30:52.726,Yeah.
00:30:53.310,00:30:54.603,You need to wear it.
00:30:54.645,00:30:56.814,Make me.
00:31:05.947,00:31:07.866,Hair gets in the way or something.
00:31:17.083,00:31:18.418,I know you did.
00:31:22.339,00:31:25.884,Last time I had my head shaved was when I was running with Derek.
00:31:25.925,00:31:26.926,Remember Derek?
00:31:26.968,00:31:28.887,"Uh, yeah."
00:31:29.971,00:31:31.557,Bet me 40 bucks I wouldn't shave it.
00:31:31.598,00:31:32.725,"I said, make it $100."
00:31:33.141,00:31:33.933,Still owes me.
00:31:35.977,00:31:37.896,Have you heard from Veronica?
00:31:37.937,00:31:39.481,She's supposed to be coming.
00:31:39.523,00:31:40.899,Is there any news on the appeal?
00:31:40.940,00:31:42.860,Don't know.
00:31:42.901,00:31:43.902,"Stop, Michael, please."
00:31:48.907,00:31:51.326,I got to get my head straight.
00:31:52.536,00:31:59.752,"Let's just share memories, swap stories, talk about the damn weather, anything but torturing myself with the idea of hope."
00:32:00.586,00:32:01.920,I can't take it anymore.
00:32:05.924,00:32:07.467,All right.
00:32:07.509,00:32:08.719,"You can't go, LJ."
00:32:08.761,00:32:09.762,I don't care.
00:32:09.803,00:32:10.846,I have to see him.
00:32:10.888,00:32:12.472,You can't go to the prison.
00:32:12.514,00:32:13.849,You'll never make it through the gate.
00:32:13.891,00:32:15.851,There will be cops everywhere.
00:32:15.893,00:32:17.936,"Look, you got to wait until we get all this cleared up, all right?"
00:32:21.981,00:32:23.275,It's the judge's clerk.
00:32:27.821,00:32:28.947,Yeah.
00:32:30.949,00:32:31.991,"Thanks, man."
00:32:32.033,00:32:33.786,They ruled against us.
00:32:33.827,00:32:34.953,Yeah.
00:32:34.994,00:32:35.788,I'm gonna go and see him.
00:32:35.829,00:32:37.997,I'm gonna stay here with LJ.
00:32:38.039,00:32:39.666,You gonna be okay going alone?
00:32:39.708,00:32:40.959,"Yeah, I'm gonna be fine."
00:32:42.043,00:32:45.213,Tell Lincoln...
00:32:50.260,00:32:52.345,Go to the back room. Go!
00:33:02.063,00:33:04.399,You're the attorneys for Lincoln Burrows?
00:33:20.874,00:33:23.126,"You letting me win, Michael?"
00:33:23.919,00:33:25.044,No.
00:33:25.086,00:33:27.046,Hmm-mmm. Show me your cards.
00:33:27.088,00:33:29.215,I'm not gonna show you my cards.
00:33:29.257,00:33:31.760,I'm not gonna show you my cards.
00:33:33.804,00:33:35.054,Gin.
00:33:35.096,00:33:36.139,"Funny, that."
00:33:37.975,00:33:39.518,Three out of five.
00:33:40.894,00:33:42.855,How often would you make those for LJ?
00:33:42.896,00:33:45.064,Whenever I had him on weekends.
00:33:46.358,00:33:48.986,May be the only decent thing I ever did for him.
00:33:49.027,00:33:50.946,No. You were there for him.
00:33:55.074,00:33:57.577,I don't know how I can stomach this stuff before...
00:34:21.142,00:34:22.978,"Your friend Sara came by, though."
00:34:23.562,00:34:24.855,Did she hear you out?
00:34:24.897,00:34:27.106,She did.
00:34:28.149,00:34:30.193,"It doesn't matter anymore, guys."
00:34:30.235,00:34:32.320,You've done more than enough for me.
00:34:33.238,00:34:34.948,That's the most important thing.
00:34:36.658,00:34:38.076,I couldn't bring LJ.
00:34:38.952,00:34:40.913,I know.
00:34:41.997,00:34:44.708,"I can get him on the phone, though."
00:34:53.174,00:34:55.093,LJ. It's your dad.
00:35:03.060,00:35:04.143,"LJ: Hey, Dad."
00:35:04.185,00:35:06.813,LJ. So this is it.
00:35:06.855,00:35:07.940,Yeah.
00:35:08.941,00:35:11.651,LINCOLN: I...
00:35:08.941,00:35:15.072,"I want you to, uh, stick with Veronica and Nick and clear your name."
00:35:15.113,00:35:16.114,You'll be all right.
00:35:17.074,00:35:18.575,"I wish I could be there, Dad."
00:35:20.911,00:35:21.954,"Me, too."
00:35:23.204,00:35:25.707,'Cause there's something I want to tell you.
00:35:26.917,00:35:27.960,What's that?
00:35:28.001,00:35:29.586,I had a dream last night.
00:35:31.088,00:35:33.423,"You and me were working on a house, pounding nails."
00:35:33.465,00:35:38.971,"And, uh, in the dream, it felt like we were older."
00:35:39.972,00:35:43.100,It was so clear.
00:35:51.441,00:35:52.651,That...
00:35:53.986,00:35:56.154,"That we'll see each other again, Dad."
00:35:56.195,00:35:58.156,I know it.
00:36:00.117,00:36:01.660,"I love you, Dad."
00:36:11.544,00:36:15.381,Those numbers support Burrows' claim about Terrence Steadman's pending indictment.
00:36:15.423,00:36:22.139,"Now, with the related murders, and then the confidential informant, I just wanted to make sure that you were fully aware of the circumstances."
00:36:22.180,00:36:25.600,"I'm fully acquainted with the Burrows case, Sara, but I never heard about any of this."
00:36:25.642,00:36:28.687,"Well, I--I hadn't either, until I spoke with Burrows' attorneys this afternoon."
00:36:33.984,00:36:35.944,And how did you get involved with all this?
00:36:35.986,00:36:38.237,These men are my patients.
00:36:38.279,00:36:40.991,"Come on, Sara."
00:36:41.033,00:36:42.408,"80, 90 percent?"
00:36:44.077,00:36:45.912,"It's not like you're asking me for a new bike here, kid."
00:36:52.711,00:36:55.839,"Part of a philosophy that I campaigned on, was elected for."
00:36:58.508,00:37:00.510,I have to go back to Fox River.
00:37:01.720,00:37:03.013,I have to be there when they kill this man.
00:37:03.055,00:37:05.057,The least you could do is review his case.
00:37:16.109,00:37:20.655,I've never given a damn about what people thought of me.
00:37:20.697,00:37:22.115,Never.
00:37:22.908,00:37:25.035,"I gotta admit, you know..."
00:37:27.286,00:37:33.543,"Lee Harvey Oswald, John Wilkes Booth, Lincoln Burrows."
00:37:34.920,00:37:38.090,I'm gonna go down in history with these freaks.
00:37:40.341,00:37:43.511,Bitch of it all is I--I didn't do it.
00:37:47.140,00:37:48.141,I didn't do it!
00:38:03.281,00:38:05.867,I didn't do it.
00:39:03.341,00:39:04.217,Warden!
00:39:05.426,00:39:06.178,What is it?
00:39:06.219,00:39:08.138,It's the Governor.
00:39:15.270,00:39:16.229,"Yes, Governor."
00:39:32.453,00:39:35.290,Okay. I understand.
00:39:42.214,00:39:43.715,He's not granting clemency.
00:39:48.469,00:39:49.846,Let's proceed.
00:40:08.907,00:40:10.283,It won't go unnoticed.
00:40:11.284,00:40:12.285,"Thank you, Madam Vice President."
00:40:12.327,00:40:14.079,"Thank you, Governor."
00:40:32.389,00:40:33.890,Can't go past here.
00:40:34.849,00:40:38.103,"Once he's in the death chamber, you'll be escorted to the viewing room."
00:40:40.021,00:40:41.106,Can I...
00:40:57.080,00:40:59.916,I've loved you since the first time I saw you.
00:41:08.425,00:41:09.467,Uncuff him.
00:41:39.205,00:41:40.457,"Let's go, son."
00:41:48.006,00:41:50.342,"LINCOLN: I didn't kill that man, Michael."
00:41:50.383,00:41:51.968,SCOFIELD: Swear to me.
00:41:52.010,00:41:53.428,"I swear to you, Michael."
00:41:58.183,00:41:59.267,"After that, you gotta take a few leaps of faith."
00:42:04.605,00:42:06.024,Don't give up on me.
00:42:07.025,00:42:08.567,What if something happens to you?
00:42:08.609,00:42:10.569,You just have a little faith.
00:42:10.611,00:42:12.197,Just have a little faith.
00:42:12.238,00:42:15.574,"How about every Sunday, we have our own special breakfast?"
00:42:15.616,00:42:16.575,Just you and me.
00:42:16.617,00:42:17.535,Yeah.
00:42:17.576,00:42:19.371,LINCOLN: Give me your hand.
00:42:19.412,00:42:20.955,"You gotta have faith, LJ."
00:42:28.254,00:42:29.588,I came in here a man.
00:42:29.630,00:42:32.384,Give me the strength to walk out of here a man.
00:00:07.090,00:00:08.926,See you on the other side.
00:00:12.095,00:00:14.348,It can't be done.
00:00:15.182,00:00:16.558,We're not getting out of here.
00:00:16.600,00:00:19.019,There's only one person who can really stop this execution.
00:00:26.151,00:00:28.069,The Governor has reviewed your case.
00:00:30.322,00:00:32.073,Let's proceed.
00:00:32.115,00:00:34.284,I came in here a man.
00:00:34.326,00:00:37.037,Give me the strength to walk out of here a man.
00:02:19.264,00:02:21.058,It's him.
00:02:22.225,00:02:24.144,Michael.
00:02:25.520,00:02:27.147,VERONICA: What's he saying?
00:02:27.940,00:02:30.191,"Michael, turn around."
00:02:30.233,00:02:32.193,It's him.
00:02:32.235,00:02:34.195,VERONICA: What do you think he's saying?
00:03:04.143,00:03:05.226,What's going on?
00:03:07.270,00:03:09.481,What's happening?
00:03:49.270,00:03:52.315,I can't tell you how sorry I am that you've had to go through all of this.
00:03:58.739,00:04:00.240,Lincoln.
00:04:13.336,00:04:14.379,What do you mean delayed?
00:04:16.339,00:04:18.633,What evidence?
00:04:18.675,00:04:21.261,How long do we have?
00:04:21.302,00:04:23.263,That's all the information I have at the moment.
00:04:27.308,00:04:29.269,You okay?
00:04:35.358,00:04:36.693,I'll go and see the judge and find out.
00:04:40.030,00:04:42.116,You're with Michael.
00:04:44.868,00:04:46.327,Did you see him?
00:04:51.291,00:04:52.292,It was Dad.
00:04:55.921,00:04:56.922,It was Dad.
00:05:33.292,00:05:35.127,It was him. I know it was.
00:05:35.877,00:05:37.378,"That's not possible, Linc."
00:05:37.420,00:05:39.298,It is possible. I saw him.
00:05:40.215,00:05:41.508,I don't know how you could have.
00:05:42.926,00:05:44.385,There were only half a dozen people in that room.
00:05:44.427,00:05:46.345,"Me, Veronica and a bunch of reporters."
00:05:50.433,00:05:52.269,I do.
00:05:52.311,00:05:54.395,You don't remember what he looks like. I do.
00:05:54.437,00:05:58.608,"This is a man who took off, what, 30 years ago?"
00:06:00.068,00:06:03.404,"Why would he come back now, at the very last minute?"
00:06:08.243,00:06:10.245,REYNOLDS: Why is he still alive?
00:06:10.287,00:06:14.415,It appears that some information was anonymously slipped to the judge.
00:06:14.457,00:06:15.458,Anonymously?
00:06:15.500,00:06:19.378,"It was your fat little friend, Hale."
00:06:19.420,00:06:20.588,If you had taken care of him sooner...
00:06:20.630,00:06:21.965,It wasn't Hale.
00:06:22.007,00:06:23.091,How do you know that?
00:06:23.133,00:06:29.306,"If Hale had given Veronica Donovan anything that could have gotten a stay of execution, I think she would have brought it up when she made her argument in court."
00:06:30.974,00:06:32.017,It didn't come from him.
00:06:32.059,00:06:33.518,"Well, who else on your end knows?"
00:06:36.479,00:06:38.439,Are you sure that the leak didn't come from your end?
00:06:38.481,00:06:42.401,"Hey, we are all on the same team, remember?"
00:06:43.486,00:06:45.239,Absolutely.
00:06:47.490,00:06:50.409,Just find the leak and plug it.
00:06:53.496,00:06:55.207,"Thank you, ma'am."
00:06:59.294,00:07:00.419,One more thing.
00:07:08.469,00:07:10.430,Absolutely.
00:07:23.402,00:07:26.529,One is Terrence Steadman's autopsy report.
00:07:36.539,00:07:37.416,The procedure was an appendectomy.
00:07:39.084,00:07:40.961,That's impossible.
00:07:41.002,00:07:44.505,I want the conviction overturned and Lincoln Burrows immediately released from custody.
00:07:44.547,00:07:46.925,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, not so fast."
00:07:48.843,00:07:50.511,The hospital can tell you.
00:07:50.553,00:07:53.556,The hospital does not keep records going back that far.
00:07:53.598,00:08:00.355,"So as far as we know, these documents could be a hoax from some anti-death penalty advocate or, dare I say it, defense counsel."
00:08:00.397,00:08:02.065,"Oh, please."
00:08:02.107,00:08:04.192,"Let's just all take a deep breath here, okay?"
00:08:04.234,00:08:08.738,"I don't know what these papers mean and for that reason, I'd like to err on the side of caution."
00:08:08.780,00:08:12.242,I'm going to delay the execution for two weeks.
00:08:17.205,00:08:21.418,"Your Honor, all due respect, that is a drastic measure."
00:08:21.460,00:08:25.297,It's also the only way we're going to know if that body in the ground is really Terrence Steadman.
00:08:30.593,00:08:33.180,Recreation hour will be over in 10...
00:08:33.221,00:08:35.474,SCOFIELD: So that's not Steadman that was buried?
00:08:35.515,00:08:39.227,VERONICA: We don't know.
00:08:40.479,00:08:41.313,"If it is, we're right back where we started."
00:08:46.443,00:08:50.405,"So, that body, what if it's him?"
00:08:53.992,00:08:55.285,What does that mean?
00:08:56.577,00:08:58.621,It means we get back to work.
00:08:58.663,00:09:00.874,"God, I was hoping you would say that."
00:09:01.875,00:09:03.293,"They're digging up the body, huh?"
00:09:04.211,00:09:08.048,"To be honest, I've never been in a situation like this before."
00:09:09.632,00:09:14.762,"If nothing else, you can be glad that you've got people who'll go to extreme lengths to get you out of here."
00:09:15.972,00:09:16.973,No kidding.
00:09:20.227,00:09:29.152,"Warden, um, at the execution, there was a man in the viewing room."
00:09:29.194,00:09:31.405,Just wondering if you or anyone in the prison had spoken to him.
00:09:33.740,00:09:43.917,"Well, according to this, those present were your brother, his attorney and three reporters, two women and a man."
00:09:43.958,00:09:45.877,"The man, who was he?"
00:09:45.919,00:09:48.922,"Um, he was from The Headline Press."
00:09:48.963,00:09:51.383,William Prall.
00:09:55.136,00:09:56.137,No.
00:10:03.644,00:10:04.938,Guard.
00:10:16.699,00:10:18.868,What exactly are you looking for in all that ink?
00:10:18.910,00:10:20.537,A new way out of here.
00:10:21.580,00:10:22.330,You don't know those plans by now?
00:10:22.372,00:10:24.207,No.
00:10:24.249,00:10:27.168,Memorizing it would be like memorizing the phone book.
00:10:27.210,00:10:30.630,"Yeah, but why not just tat up Route 66?"
00:10:31.172,00:10:32.966,Contingencies.
00:10:37.429,00:10:39.139,You saying you found another way?
00:10:39.680,00:10:40.681,Maybe.
00:10:40.723,00:10:42.601,"What do you mean, maybe?"
00:10:55.989,00:10:59.326,"Man, I'm so cold my hands are stinging."
00:10:59.367,00:11:05.790,"You know what they say about weather in the Midwest, if you don't like it, wait an hour."
00:11:08.751,00:11:12.213,We're still going out through the infirmary and we're still going to do it from the guards' room.
00:11:14.924,00:11:16.884,Now wait a minute.
00:11:16.926,00:11:18.803,We're already through that room beneath the infirmary.
00:11:21.764,00:11:23.933,"There's a reason they replaced it with a 12-inch pipe, Darwin."
00:11:23.975,00:11:25.935,People can't get through it.
00:11:25.977,00:11:28.855,The only way we're getting into that infirmary is from beneath.
00:11:28.896,00:11:30.982,We're going to have to find another way.
00:11:32.108,00:11:34.068,WESTMORELAND: The psych ward?
00:11:34.110,00:11:37.071,It's the only building that shares a subsurface line with the infirmary.
00:11:42.785,00:11:44.078,Unless you got a better idea.
00:11:47.790,00:11:50.084,Sort of.
00:11:50.126,00:11:52.587,"Oh, whoa, whoa. What do you-- What do you mean sort of?"
00:11:52.629,00:11:54.755,We can go into that hole in the guards' room.
00:11:54.797,00:11:57.342,"About 40 yards up Route 66, there's a grate and that'll get us halfway there."
00:11:58.801,00:12:00.261,And what about the rest of the way?
00:12:02.805,00:12:07.768,"Oh, so it's just a bunch of cons taking a stroll in the middle of the night for all the guards to see?"
00:12:09.563,00:12:12.357,You're right. It is suicide.
00:12:18.196,00:12:21.991,"This grate that you're talking about, it's hidden, right, partner?"
00:12:26.621,00:12:27.163,"Well, where is it?"
00:12:31.251,00:12:33.545,"Oh, hell no."
00:12:35.004,00:12:44.556,"When we come up out of that ground there, that tower there, that tower there, that tower behind me is gonna see us."
00:12:44.598,00:12:46.140,We'll be like ducks in a shooting range.
00:12:46.182,00:12:48.393,"Hurry it up, cons."
00:12:48.435,00:12:51.104,"Your plan sucks, snowflake."
00:13:15.962,00:13:17.838,I gotta go back into the walls tonight.
00:13:18.881,00:13:25.305,"I gotta get over to psych ward, familiarize myself with the pipes beneath, make sure we can get through."
00:13:25.346,00:13:27.974,"I don't know, Michael."
00:13:28.015,00:13:29.392,C-Note's got a point.
00:13:30.560,00:13:33.938,"We come up in the middle of that yard, we're sitting ducks."
00:13:34.439,00:13:36.566,I know.
00:13:47.535,00:13:48.995,I might have an idea.
00:13:51.581,00:14:00.839,My family and I are more than dismayed by Judge Kessler's decision to allow the exhumation of my brother.
00:14:02.091,00:14:13.394,"This stunt by Lincoln Burrows' defense counsel is an affront and an insult to the memory of my brother, a good man who tried to make positive change in this country."
00:14:14.395,00:14:21.986,This is being done in the name of trying to release a convicted killer from prison.
00:14:25.406,00:14:27.492,Steadman asked for a green burial.
00:14:27.534,00:14:29.118,"No embalming, biodegradable coffin."
00:14:32.955,00:14:35.875,"Or smart, if you don't want the body to be identified."
00:14:40.714,00:14:43.383,We haven't hung in months and now you want a favor?
00:14:43.424,00:14:46.135,"You know I love you, cuz, but that's a big ask."
00:14:46.177,00:14:47.303,I gotta say no.
00:14:47.345,00:14:49.930,You can't say no.
00:14:50.973,00:14:56.479,"If my mom, or worse, your mom knows I did anything in here to get you in trouble, forget it."
00:14:56.521,00:14:57.980,"I'm in prison, pendejo."
00:14:58.022,00:14:59.524,How much trouble can I get into?
00:14:59.566,00:15:00.608,A lot. Damn!
00:15:01.984,00:15:03.944,You owe me.
00:15:03.986,00:15:06.280,Like hell I do.
00:15:09.576,00:15:10.410,The Terrado sisters?
00:15:11.411,00:15:12.537,Your brother's lost El Camino.
00:15:22.797,00:15:25.925,"Yo. We took an oath, bro."
00:15:27.009,00:15:28.469,Don't make me break it.
00:15:31.347,00:15:33.892,"BURROWS: Come on, Linc, we want to catch batting practice."
00:15:36.018,00:15:37.937,Let's hurry. Take my hand.
00:15:46.028,00:15:46.987,"Great seats, huh?"
00:15:47.029,00:15:48.656,Yeah.
00:15:48.698,00:15:50.241,See Number 11 over there?
00:15:50.283,00:15:51.659,Keep your eye on him.
00:16:05.339,00:16:06.591,You got it?
00:16:08.050,00:16:09.051,Where is it?
00:16:09.093,00:16:10.970,"Oh, he's cool."
00:16:16.058,00:16:17.226,"Hey, and I need this back by morning."
00:16:17.268,00:16:21.147,They'll know if something like that is missing.
00:16:21.188,00:16:24.484,"And, cuz, now you owe me."
00:16:55.556,00:16:58.309,"Hey, you dropped something."
00:16:59.101,00:17:00.603,Does that say Iraq?
00:17:01.771,00:17:03.063,Thanks.
00:17:17.161,00:17:19.580,Let's look busy.
00:17:21.332,00:17:23.042,What the hell?
00:17:23.459,00:17:25.920,"Oh, shoot."
00:17:27.129,00:17:29.048,"SUCRE: Damn, bro, what did you do?"
00:17:30.132,00:17:32.051,WESTMORELAND: It's the cement we dug up.
00:17:38.516,00:17:42.687,"My God, you cons are slower than a spelling bee full of stutterers."
00:17:43.938,00:17:45.523,You all think you can slow-walk this job?
00:17:49.736,00:17:50.403,Get to work.
00:17:50.444,00:17:52.864,"You got it, boss."
00:17:55.157,00:17:57.076,"How about it, eight ball?"
00:17:58.160,00:17:59.286,Get to work.
00:18:06.168,00:18:07.169,"You disobeying me, convict?"
00:18:07.211,00:18:10.089,The man said get to work.
00:18:11.173,00:18:13.133,"What the hell is your problem, old head?"
00:18:13.175,00:18:16.804,My problem is young con punks who don't know how things work around here.
00:18:22.184,00:18:23.728,"Otherwise, grab a hammer."
00:18:26.313,00:18:29.149,"BELLICK: Still got some piss and vinegar in those old veins, huh, Charles?"
00:18:41.203,00:18:42.121,"Close one, huh?"
00:18:52.339,00:18:54.174,"Oh, man."
00:18:54.216,00:18:57.136,What are we gonna do with this?
00:18:58.471,00:19:01.057,"It was Ole Miss, right?"
00:19:01.099,00:19:03.059,"Nah, it was a Midwestern school."
00:19:04.226,00:19:05.144,"No, not Iowa."
00:19:06.270,00:19:08.522,"Hey, Bagwell."
00:19:17.031,00:19:20.159,"Hey, do you know what school Art Schlichter played for?"
00:19:22.244,00:19:25.081,"Not really sure there, boss."
00:19:30.252,00:19:34.214,"I really ain't much of a football guy, boss."
00:19:36.258,00:19:38.678,"Art Schlichter, the quarterback, got nailed for gambling."
00:19:38.719,00:19:40.220,"No, doesn't really ring a bell."
00:19:44.266,00:19:46.519,"Hey, maybe someone in the brain trust knows."
00:19:49.939,00:19:53.776,"Hold on, I just want to figure this out."
00:20:00.282,00:20:03.619,That's right.
00:20:06.288,00:20:08.207,"You're not completely worthless, after all."
00:20:14.296,00:20:16.340,How's your stomach?
00:20:17.299,00:20:18.258,Any more vomiting?
00:20:19.301,00:20:21.220,Just nauseous.
00:20:21.261,00:20:23.222,"That's understandable, considering."
00:20:24.390,00:20:25.850,I can give you something for it.
00:20:25.892,00:20:27.226,"No, that's--that's fine."
00:20:31.731,00:20:33.691,"You, uh, you let me know if there's anything you need."
00:20:36.027,00:20:37.236,"Can I ask you a question, Doc?"
00:20:38.029,00:20:39.780,Yeah. What?
00:20:44.326,00:20:51.291,"Yeah. Yeah, anxiety attacks are often accompanied by flashes of light, black spots..."
00:20:51.333,00:20:52.376,"No, no, no."
00:20:55.922,00:20:57.215,There were people there.
00:20:57.256,00:20:59.258,This person couldn't have been there.
00:21:02.344,00:21:05.806,"Yeah, Lincoln, you've heard of, uh, post-traumatic stress disorder, right?"
00:21:07.349,00:21:09.309,I'm gonna call you a prime candidate.
00:21:09.351,00:21:12.312,I don't think a lot of people have been through what you just did.
00:21:12.354,00:21:24.825,"So if you-- if you thought you saw someone, it's possible that it was your subconscious giving you what you wanted, whoever it was that you wanted to be there with you in that moment to--to comfort you."
00:21:35.253,00:21:36.921,"Thanks, Doc. Thank you."
00:21:40.925,00:21:42.135,Sure thing.
00:21:55.856,00:22:04.364,"Seen a lot of rackets in my time, but if you're doing what I think you're doing with those postcards, yours definitely takes the cake."
00:22:04.406,00:22:08.368,"Yeah, how about saving the small talk, old head, 'cause you and I ain't got nothing in common."
00:22:08.410,00:22:10.370,What do you do?
00:22:10.412,00:22:16.335,Write them here and then send them to a pal in Iraq and have him mail them your wife's way?
00:22:19.421,00:22:21.381,'Cause you don't know nothing about my racket.
00:22:21.423,00:22:25.385,A con pretending he ain't in the hole to his family.
00:22:25.427,00:22:29.265,I seen that once or twice.
00:22:30.016,00:22:31.391,"Yeah, you the one to talk."
00:22:32.434,00:22:34.436,"Dede, is that your wife or your kid?"
00:22:35.980,00:22:40.567,"Now you listen, I don't even want you to say her name in this prison."
00:22:40.609,00:22:41.777,You feel me?
00:22:43.445,00:22:44.780,A daughter.
00:22:45.656,00:22:47.491,Definitely a daughter.
00:22:53.289,00:22:55.124,'Cause I got one myself.
00:22:56.458,00:23:02.089,"You know, after you break outside these walls, that's the first place they're gonna look for you."
00:23:02.131,00:23:03.257,Family.
00:23:04.424,00:23:08.428,Now why is it you think that I'm that dumb that I would go directly there?
00:23:08.470,00:23:12.850,'Cause that's exactly the first place I'm gonna go.
00:23:15.602,00:23:18.396,Turns out maybe we got something in common after all.
00:23:32.036,00:23:34.247,See Number 11 over there?
00:23:34.288,00:23:35.081,Keep your eye on him.
00:23:35.122,00:23:37.457,Watch him closely.
00:23:37.499,00:23:38.584,Mid-level reliever at best.
00:23:38.625,00:23:41.170,But he's always working at it.
00:23:41.212,00:23:43.421,That's why he's your old man's favorite player.
00:23:57.103,00:23:58.436,William Prall.
00:23:59.521,00:24:00.689,You know him?
00:24:04.610,00:24:07.445,The pipe system beneath the psych ward is...
00:24:10.866,00:24:12.118,Be real easy to get lost.
00:24:13.535,00:24:15.288,How complex can it be?
00:24:19.083,00:24:21.543,"When they built this place in 1858, the pipes were lead."
00:24:28.550,00:24:30.344,Cost too much.
00:24:32.972,00:24:35.599,"And then a few years ago, they switched to industrial plastic."
00:24:35.641,00:24:38.476,"Again, it was cheaper just to lay it over the old stuff."
00:24:39.603,00:24:43.107,"If I make a wrong turn down there tonight, I won't make it back by count."
00:24:45.567,00:24:47.653,"Well, you won't make the wrong turn, right?"
00:27:21.056,00:27:23.100,I don't believe my eyes.
00:27:23.142,00:27:26.562,One of the blues actually coming into psych ward.
00:27:30.774,00:27:33.693,Mind if I use your facilities?
00:27:33.735,00:27:34.652,"Yeah, be my guest."
00:27:38.532,00:27:40.618,I don't know why you guys are so scared of the whack shack.
00:27:40.658,00:27:44.913,"I mean, between the killers and the crazies, I'll take the crazies."
00:27:44.955,00:27:49.835,"Because if a crazy steps out of line, all I gotta do is shoot him with 40 cc's of shut your trap and it's beddy-bye."
00:27:52.254,00:27:54.672,"So, uh, which way is the bathroom?"
00:27:55.924,00:27:58.010,"Down the hall, through the door, make a right."
00:31:06.990,00:31:09.284,I was just looking for the bathroom.
00:31:10.952,00:31:14.914,"Yeah. You said down the hall, through the door and to the left."
00:31:14.956,00:31:18.669,"No, I said through the door and make a right."
00:31:18.711,00:31:20.713,Ah. My bad.
00:31:22.840,00:31:23.882,Have a good night.
00:31:36.978,00:31:38.938,Don't you still gotta take a leak?
00:31:43.985,00:31:50.075,"With decomposition this extensive, the most accurate identification tool is dental records."
00:31:55.997,00:31:57.082,And?
00:31:57.123,00:31:59.125,They were a perfect match.
00:32:01.002,00:32:02.462,"Thank you, Doctor."
00:32:02.504,00:32:04.089,That can't be Terrence Steadman.
00:32:04.130,00:32:10.053,"If you like, you can bring in a forensic examiner of your own choosing to examine the body."
00:32:16.017,00:32:18.103,Thank you.
00:32:25.026,00:32:26.945,I hope you're proud of this.
00:32:30.031,00:32:34.536,You've gotten your pound of flesh.
00:32:40.083,00:32:41.710,Come on. Come on.
00:34:16.137,00:34:17.890,"Hey, Mack, you there?"
00:34:17.931,00:34:19.808,Yeah.
00:34:19.850,00:34:21.393,What's your 20?
00:34:21.434,00:34:23.102,I gotta stop by maintenance real quick.
00:34:23.144,00:34:24.938,I'll be up in a minute.
00:35:16.197,00:35:17.282,You okay?
00:35:19.701,00:35:21.036,I'm burned.
00:35:21.078,00:35:22.955,"Oh, God."
00:35:24.748,00:35:26.666,"All right, help me take this off."
00:35:26.708,00:35:29.168,"No, it's like, burned to your skin."
00:35:29.210,00:35:30.712,Are you kidding me? I can't.
00:35:30.754,00:35:34.173,"If the guards catch me wearing this, I'm a dead man."
00:35:34.215,00:35:35.174,"Bro, it's just not..."
00:35:35.216,00:35:37.844,Do it. Please do it.
00:35:42.099,00:35:43.141,Ready?
00:35:43.182,00:35:45.936,"One, two..."
00:36:05.664,00:36:08.207,"Michael, it's Sara."
00:36:08.249,00:36:10.085,Groggy.
00:36:10.127,00:36:12.087,It's the anesthesia.
00:36:16.257,00:36:18.217,Why did I have anesthesia?
00:36:18.259,00:36:20.178,We had to perform a procedure.
00:36:23.264,00:36:30.105,"So, you got so sick of Scofield's smart mouth that you decided to deep fry him, is that it?"
00:36:30.147,00:36:32.273,"I didn't do anything to him, I swear."
00:36:32.315,00:36:33.191,Let's review.
00:36:36.611,00:36:37.612,Two inmates.
00:36:42.283,00:36:45.078,You think we should call Matlock in on this one?
00:36:46.287,00:36:48.247,Who's Matlock?
00:36:51.250,00:36:56.006,I told you I didn't burn him.
00:36:56.048,00:36:57.549,You found him like that.
00:36:58.758,00:37:01.260,He was acting kind of weird when we lined up for final count.
00:37:14.816,00:37:16.275,My ass.
00:37:16.317,00:37:19.278,Ask him yourself when the doc's done with him.
00:37:19.320,00:37:20.822,I didn't touch him.
00:37:29.039,00:37:30.999,How bad is it?
00:37:31.041,00:37:32.500,"Uh, I'd take the pills."
00:37:34.335,00:37:35.587,Do I get to see it?
00:37:35.628,00:37:38.256,"No, bandage stays on for now."
00:37:48.600,00:37:49.809,Who did?
00:37:52.687,00:37:55.023,This is the part where I don't answer you.
00:38:01.362,00:38:02.822,I'll have you sent back to your cell.
00:38:04.365,00:38:06.325,SARA: All yours.
00:38:18.296,00:38:19.380,"Hey, Katie, it's me."
00:38:19.422,00:38:21.591,"Listen, uh, can you come up to my office for a second?"
00:38:23.301,00:38:25.762,What the hell am I gonna do now?
00:38:27.222,00:38:29.307,"I'm sorry, cuz."
00:38:32.351,00:38:34.312,"Hey, slim!"
00:38:35.438,00:38:38.316,"Um, there's been a bit of a problem, boss."
00:38:40.401,00:38:43.280,I left the iron on it too long.
00:38:43.780,00:38:47.366,"You are as stupid as you are fat, do you know that, D-cups?"
00:38:47.408,00:38:49.327,My new shirt's coming out of your kick.
00:38:53.290,00:38:55.000,You're gonna tell me right now.
00:38:55.041,00:38:56.001,Tell you what?
00:38:56.042,00:38:59.129,What the hell you got going on that's got you burning up guard suits?
00:39:00.630,00:39:02.715,"Trust me, primo."
00:39:14.477,00:39:16.354,Any news?
00:39:17.438,00:39:19.440,"No. No, not yet."
00:39:19.482,00:39:21.609,Testing takes a couple of days.
00:39:25.446,00:39:27.032,Your dad?
00:39:27.073,00:39:28.449,I didn't know him.
00:39:28.491,00:39:32.411,Your mom said some pretty horrible stuff about him when we were growing up.
00:39:32.453,00:39:35.623,I think I saw him when I was in the chair.
00:39:36.208,00:39:38.084,Lincoln.
00:39:38.126,00:39:39.418,It was him. I know it was.
00:39:42.297,00:39:44.090,How would you know?
00:39:46.134,00:39:48.303,"The name that was used, Willie Prall."
00:39:48.345,00:39:49.554,So?
00:39:49.595,00:39:51.764,It's the name of this guy who threw for Chicago back in the day.
00:39:51.806,00:39:54.976,Dad and me were really into him but I'd forgotten all about him.
00:39:55.810,00:39:57.395,It's really weird.
00:39:58.479,00:40:02.984,"Been having these dreams, memories, things I guess I suppressed when he left."
00:40:03.026,00:40:04.110,But...
00:40:05.486,00:40:09.448,"This man who came to the execution, how do you know he used that name?"
00:40:09.490,00:40:10.783,Pope told me.
00:40:10.825,00:40:13.494,Was that before or after you had the dream?
00:40:15.288,00:40:18.666,"Look, I'm sorry, okay?"
00:40:20.043,00:40:25.423,"I don't mean to challenge what you're saying, but your dad's been MIA almost your entire life."
00:40:25.464,00:40:27.300,"I know what I saw, V."
00:40:28.426,00:40:30.387,I know what I saw.
00:40:38.270,00:40:42.357,This is the security camera footage of the courthouse from the night that Judge Kessler got those documents.
00:40:42.399,00:40:44.442,"Now, check out this guy."
00:40:46.111,00:40:47.445,He is very skilled.
00:40:48.654,00:40:51.490,He moves casually enough to avoid suspicion.
00:40:56.537,00:40:58.456,He knows exactly where those cameras are.
00:41:02.168,00:41:05.838,Wait. Right there.
00:41:08.758,00:41:10.468,Right. Can you blow that up?
00:41:20.561,00:41:22.188,Son of a bitch.
00:41:22.230,00:41:23.481,What?
00:41:25.650,00:41:27.402,I know that guy.
00:41:31.572,00:41:33.950,"Well, what is it?"
00:41:33.992,00:41:35.994,It was fused into Michael Scofield's skin.
00:41:36.035,00:41:38.246,I removed it during the debridement procedure.
00:41:38.288,00:41:39.038,And what about it?
00:41:43.584,00:41:45.170,Where'd it come from then?
00:41:45.211,00:41:47.422,"As far as I can tell, a guard's uniform."
00:42:00.601,00:42:02.437,Open on 40!
00:42:02.479,00:42:03.562,GUARD: 40 open!
00:42:05.564,00:42:07.566,Close 40!
00:42:08.151,00:42:09.527,40 closed!
00:42:11.029,00:42:12.822,How you feeling?
00:42:41.017,00:42:42.394,What's wrong?
00:42:43.644,00:42:55.156,"The blueprints, the ones we need to get from the psych ward to the infirmary, our map out of here, they're gone."
00:00:04.964,00:00:06.005,SCOFIELD: Rough night?
00:00:11.136,00:00:12.596,Lost my keys.
00:00:13.263,00:00:15.265,Where'd you find them?
00:00:15.307,00:00:16.934,Four feet that way.
00:00:18.101,00:00:19.728,Must've dropped them.
00:00:21.146,00:00:23.022,How you doing?
00:00:24.065,00:00:25.275,Fine. How are you?
00:00:26.151,00:00:27.277,Cold.
00:00:28.570,00:00:30.030,"Man, I, uh..."
00:00:35.118,00:00:38.079,"Speaking of which, I heard you got fired a few weeks ago."
00:00:41.291,00:00:43.126,You really want to know?
00:00:43.168,00:00:44.879,Or are you just enjoying the view from your high horse?
00:00:46.588,00:00:48.047,You know what I want?
00:01:10.696,00:01:12.531,"What you doing here, Crab?"
00:01:18.161,00:01:20.247,"I'm gonna get your 90 grand, all right?"
00:01:23.166,00:01:24.167,By who?
00:01:24.209,00:01:26.503,Someone who likes to do people favors.
00:01:28.171,00:01:33.052,"I don't know what it is you think you're getting, but let's be clear about something."
00:01:33.092,00:01:34.135,It's gonna be a few days before I get the money lined up.
00:01:34.177,00:01:35.512,Let's not kid ourselves.
00:01:35.554,00:01:39.140,You can't get anywhere near that kind of money.
00:01:39.182,00:01:41.100,So let's talk about what you can do for me.
00:01:50.193,00:01:57.492,"Okay, if you had to choose, Vice President Reynolds or Kathy in HR?"
00:01:57.534,00:01:59.036,I'll take door number three.
00:02:05.960,00:02:07.086,V.
00:02:09.254,00:02:11.506,"Um, good. I'm good."
00:02:11.548,00:02:13.133,"I'm okay. You know, I'm over at Glazer and Ross."
00:02:13.174,00:02:17.096,Lawyer number 97.
00:02:27.230,00:02:28.273,How is he?
00:02:31.234,00:02:33.070,Mmm?
00:02:33.112,00:02:35.238,He's... He's Linc.
00:02:36.698,00:02:39.076,I don't care who the guy is.
00:02:39.118,00:02:41.244,I must have missed the part where I gave you a choice.
00:02:41.286,00:02:43.246,HALE: Black leather jacket.
00:02:43.288,00:02:46.166,"Two buttons down the front, three on each sleeve."
00:03:06.145,00:03:08.730,"Think of this as a $90,000 bullet."
00:03:10.107,00:03:16.738,"You start fresh, and you keep me from finding out if there's someone in your life you will do something for."
00:03:27.457,00:03:29.208,You know how you can tell God is a man?
00:03:29.250,00:03:30.418,Shoes.
00:03:31.545,00:03:32.838,Oh!
00:03:33.296,00:03:34.297,Easy.
00:03:54.317,00:03:55.402,VERONICA: What?
00:03:55.443,00:03:56.444,"It's, uh..."
00:03:59.322,00:04:00.281,You gonna answer it?
00:04:04.494,00:04:08.874,He'll leave a message.
00:04:10.333,00:04:12.169,"Michael, it's Linc."
00:04:14.421,00:04:15.589,I--I can't get out of it.
00:04:16.840,00:04:17.716,to straighten me out.
00:04:17.758,00:04:20.260,My head is all messed up and...
00:04:21.595,00:04:23.680,"Anyway, it's real important, bro."
00:04:35.275,00:04:36.401,I can't do this.
00:04:37.402,00:04:38.403,I know.
00:04:40.114,00:04:41.115,I know.
00:04:49.123,00:04:51.041,I'll call you a cab.
00:06:37.480,00:06:38.148,Did we get him?
00:06:38.190,00:06:39.691,"I believe we did, partner."
00:06:50.077,00:06:51.452,SUCRE: Are you kidding me?
00:06:53.205,00:06:55.249,"MANCHE: Nando, we should've whooped that guy's ass."
00:07:04.507,00:07:06.176,MANCHE: With a plastic hip.
00:07:08.220,00:07:09.470,"Oh, my God."
00:07:09.512,00:07:11.265,What?
00:07:28.656,00:07:33.287,"Dr. Davis, telephone, please."
00:07:34.288,00:07:35.414,"Hey, they're waiting for you in 4B."
00:07:35.455,00:07:37.832,"Oh, pull his film."
00:07:37.874,00:07:39.084,Okay.
00:08:56.619,00:08:59.539,"All right, a deal's a deal."
00:09:03.502,00:09:05.128,Thank you.
00:09:05.170,00:09:08.173,"And my wife and daughter back home thank you too, sir."
00:09:17.640,00:09:20.601,These coal seams are pretty significant.
00:09:20.643,00:09:22.645,Hey.
00:09:24.272,00:09:25.648,Would you give us a minute?
00:09:28.235,00:09:29.610,Have you been watching the news?
00:09:36.659,00:09:38.661,Terrence Steadman.
00:09:39.787,00:09:41.664,The Vice President's brother.
00:09:43.833,00:09:45.710,Do you have any idea what they're gonna do to you?
00:09:45.752,00:09:47.587,"I didn't do it, man."
00:09:47.628,00:09:49.589,You knew him.
00:09:50.257,00:09:51.550,Who?
00:09:52.633,00:09:54.135,You worked for his company.
00:09:54.177,00:09:55.929,From which you were fired a few weeks ago.
00:09:55.970,00:09:57.431,I loaded containers in the warehouse.
00:09:57.472,00:09:59.307,Never met the guy.
00:09:59.349,00:10:00.934,You sound like one of the damn detectives.
00:10:00.975,00:10:02.602,I'm just saying.
00:10:09.276,00:10:11.194,I heard you owe someone 90 grand.
00:10:15.698,00:10:16.991,People talk.
00:10:18.201,00:10:19.994,And I know Steadman had a lot of money.
00:10:20.036,00:10:21.662,"I may be a lot of things, but I'm not a murderer."
00:10:21.704,00:10:24.624,Then what were you doing in that garage last night?
00:10:26.585,00:10:29.921,You admitted to the police you were there.
00:10:32.715,00:10:37.929,"Honestly, Linc, I don't know how it's come to this."
00:10:39.139,00:10:43.935,"And you can't keep blaming Mom for dying and Dad for leaving, because I was there, too."
00:10:48.565,00:10:51.651,Mom had life insurance.
00:10:53.820,00:10:55.655,"What did you do with your half, Linc?"
00:10:58.658,00:11:01.661,"Everything's not how it looks, Michael."
00:11:03.037,00:11:05.206,I hope for your sake that's true.
00:11:06.040,00:11:07.626,Here...
00:11:07.667,00:11:08.709,Here is where we want the turn to anger.
00:11:12.422,00:11:15.133,Now remember to stress his record as a repeat offender.
00:11:15.175,00:11:18.303,We need the public behind us if we want the death penalty.
00:11:18.345,00:11:20.679,And where are we with Governor Tancredi?
00:11:22.349,00:11:25.185,He has aspirations.
00:11:26.394,00:11:27.686,"MAN: Uh, 30 seconds, Madam Vice President."
00:11:31.149,00:11:33.109,VERONICA: The papers have already crucified him.
00:11:33.151,00:11:38.365,The police say they got a phone call right after the murder from someone claiming they saw Lincoln running from the parking garage.
00:11:38.406,00:11:39.991,He was into someone for 90 grand.
00:11:40.033,00:11:43.036,What do you need that kind of money for?
00:11:44.204,00:11:45.205,Forget about what you want to be true.
00:11:45.246,00:11:46.705,Let's look at this objectively.
00:11:46.747,00:11:47.706,Maybe you should too.
00:11:49.250,00:11:51.085,"All right, you know what?"
00:11:49.250,00:11:55.923,"I promised I wouldn't say anything, but I'm getting tired of you talking about him like he's some guy from the neighborhood that you used to know."
00:11:57.384,00:12:02.763,"And I know he helped you out with your dad back in the day, but you should see the kind of person he is now, the kind of people he keeps friends with."
00:12:02.805,00:12:04.516,You want to know what the 90 grand was for?
00:12:04.558,00:12:05.600,I think I do.
00:12:05.642,00:12:06.476,You.
00:12:07.810,00:12:12.106,The money you got when you were 18 years old from your mother's life insurance?
00:12:12.148,00:12:16.695,"The money that paid for your degree, that got you this job, that bought you your loft?"
00:12:16.735,00:12:18.905,Your mother never had life insurance.
00:12:20.615,00:12:22.783,How?
00:12:22.825,00:12:27.121,"He knew it would be tough to pay back, but that didn't matter, because he thought you deserved it."
00:12:27.163,00:12:30.041,He also knew you'd never accept it if you knew it came from him.
00:12:36.214,00:12:39.384,You're telling me he is where he is because of me?
00:12:51.438,00:12:52.813,Why?
00:12:54.232,00:12:56.192,Why didn't you tell me about the money?
00:12:56.901,00:12:58.945,No need to.
00:12:58.986,00:12:59.987,"Oh, Linc."
00:13:00.029,00:13:01.322,Who told you? Veronica?
00:13:03.866,00:13:05.868,What did she make of all this? About me?
00:13:06.911,00:13:07.912,I don't know.
00:13:07.954,00:13:09.956,"Glad she got out when she did, huh?"
00:13:10.957,00:13:12.833,You know how she feels about you.
00:13:12.875,00:13:15.920,It's been the same way ever since we were kids.
00:13:16.921,00:13:17.922,Yeah.
00:13:21.884,00:13:26.139,"Linc, I owe you an apology."
00:13:26.889,00:13:28.015,For what?
00:13:29.726,00:13:30.809,The night you called.
00:13:32.353,00:13:34.897,"If we'd talked, maybe I could have stopped you."
00:13:34.939,00:13:37.191,"Hey, hey, hey, hey."
00:13:38.109,00:13:40.153,Then who's is it?
00:13:40.903,00:13:42.947,Listen up.
00:13:42.989,00:13:44.907,You need to forget about this.
00:13:45.950,00:13:47.910,Move on. Work hard.
00:13:51.914,00:13:53.124,I can't do that.
00:13:53.166,00:13:55.960,"Oh, yes, you can."
00:14:06.763,00:14:09.557,All the evidence is lining up in a path that leads directly to you.
00:14:10.391,00:14:12.519,They say they have you on tape.
00:14:15.938,00:14:18.149,Pulling the trigger.
00:14:21.944,00:14:29.577,"If you didn't kill Terrence Steadman, how the hell did someone make it look like you did?"
00:14:34.541,00:14:36.125,Perfect.
00:14:42.965,00:14:44.008,She from the block?
00:14:44.050,00:14:47.011,Nope. Uptown. Pill Hill.
00:14:50.097,00:14:51.932,You think you could hold on to a girl from the PH?
00:15:10.076,00:15:11.494,Open the drawer!
00:15:11.536,00:15:12.953,"Open the drawer, cono!"
00:15:12.995,00:15:14.997,Quick! Quick! Quick!
00:15:20.086,00:15:22.338,"Actually, this is all I need."
00:15:23.047,00:15:24.173,Okay.
00:15:28.595,00:15:30.346,"C-NOTE: I appreciate your business, man."
00:15:32.014,00:15:34.934,I'll have that in here for you about next week.
00:16:55.264,00:16:56.975,SARA: Ah.
00:16:58.685,00:17:02.689,I brought you a gift from the hospital.
00:17:04.064,00:17:07.067,I brought you a gift from the hospital.
00:17:10.112,00:17:11.823,"I'm telling you, it is like Christmas."
00:17:16.118,00:17:19.288,If the North Pole had gunshot wounds and cancer patients...
00:17:19.330,00:17:21.040,"Seriously, I don't know how you work there."
00:17:22.166,00:17:23.710,What do you mean?
00:17:32.301,00:17:34.053,And you like helping your friends.
00:17:42.937,00:17:43.980,"Oh, my God."
00:17:47.984,00:17:49.276,"Oh, my God."
00:17:49.318,00:17:50.194,WOMAN: Can you hear us?
00:17:56.242,00:17:57.117,Who's got a telephone?
00:18:04.166,00:18:06.335,Call 911! Help!
00:18:08.254,00:18:09.881,Are you a doctor?
00:18:11.841,00:18:13.217,Can you help him?
00:19:04.226,00:19:07.021,That's fine.
00:19:08.272,00:19:11.233,Prisoner-abuse report you filed?
00:19:11.275,00:19:12.652,"Yes, sir."
00:19:13.945,00:19:15.029,I need to know how far you're willing to go with this.
00:19:15.071,00:19:16.238,"Whatever it takes, sir."
00:19:16.280,00:19:21.201,"I particularly have no love for the desert donkeys, but I do have some for the Geneva Convention."
00:19:21.243,00:19:25.247,"Something like this gets out, it might open up our boys to similar treatment from the enemy."
00:19:25.289,00:19:27.166,"I understand that, sir."
00:19:28.459,00:19:30.210,But I'm not planning on calling a press conference.
00:19:30.252,00:19:31.671,"What I'm saying is, I..."
00:19:32.296,00:19:37.176,"What I saw was wrong, and someone needs to take responsibility for it, sir."
00:19:39.303,00:19:40.304,All right.
00:19:41.430,00:19:43.265,Please take Mr. Franklin into custody.
00:19:43.307,00:19:45.225,"Yes, sir."
00:19:45.267,00:19:46.644,"What? What the hell is going on, sir?"
00:19:46.686,00:19:52.025,"Sergeant Franklin, I'm hereby recommending that you be dishonorably discharged from the United States Army."
00:19:53.275,00:19:55.277,For engaging in illegal black-market...
00:19:55.319,00:19:57.237,"You asked me to get that stuff, man!"
00:19:57.279,00:19:58.614,I kept it to myself.
00:20:02.118,00:20:04.286,You can't do this.
00:20:04.328,00:20:07.289,You can't do this!
00:20:10.751,00:20:12.252,Has the jury reached a verdict?
00:20:12.294,00:20:14.254,"We have, Your Honor."
00:20:14.296,00:20:15.422,What say you?
00:20:17.299,00:20:24.182,"In the matter of The People of the State of Illinois vs. Lincoln Burrows, on the count of murder in the first degree, we find the defendant guilty."
00:20:26.308,00:20:31.438,"The defendant will remain in custody until one week from today, when we commence the penalty phase."
00:20:49.289,00:20:50.457,"I'm so sorry, Linc."
00:20:51.375,00:20:53.252,Don't be.
00:21:05.347,00:21:06.473,Hmm.
00:21:07.349,00:21:12.521,"How after we make love, you get this little puddle of water in your belly button."
00:21:16.483,00:21:17.484,And get out of there!
00:21:17.526,00:21:19.195,I think it's beautiful.
00:21:22.448,00:21:25.034,I think you're beautiful.
00:21:27.245,00:21:28.246,"What do you want, Fernando?"
00:21:33.000,00:21:34.293,Stop.
00:21:35.461,00:21:36.837,From the future.
00:21:37.713,00:21:40.258,What do you want from the future?
00:21:42.051,00:21:44.845,Would you run if I said you?
00:21:46.597,00:21:48.307,Would you chase me if I did?
00:21:51.351,00:21:52.603,DARIUS: I don't get it.
00:21:53.687,00:21:57.316,"All these commercials show brothers learning computer skills, new technologies."
00:21:58.692,00:22:01.320,Uncle Sam didn't teach me nothing but cadence and kill.
00:22:05.992,00:22:08.953,Especially with a brother with a dishonorable discharge.
00:22:08.995,00:22:11.371,"Goes right to the bottom of the pile, man."
00:22:11.413,00:22:12.372,How long you think you can keep this up?
00:22:17.419,00:22:20.256,Your unit's been on leave for a long damn time now.
00:22:21.507,00:22:24.218,"Pretty soon they gonna stop thinking you're lucky, and she's gonna start asking questions."
00:22:24.260,00:22:26.679,"Yeah, well, then I need to start finding some answers."
00:22:26.720,00:22:29.640,"Look, I happen to know of an employment opportunity."
00:22:31.058,00:22:32.268,"Come on, man, you know I don't get down like that."
00:22:32.310,00:22:34.520,It's just driving a truck.
00:22:37.898,00:22:39.859,"Uncle Sam taught you how to drive trucks, didn't he?"
00:22:41.110,00:22:43.361,Yeah. And he also taught me to look inside.
00:22:47.074,00:22:49.576,"A to B, your call."
00:22:51.620,00:22:52.913,Yeah.
00:22:53.831,00:22:55.041,They didn't even let her testify.
00:22:58.460,00:22:59.628,And that cop?
00:22:59.670,00:23:01.297,Changed his story a dozen times.
00:23:01.339,00:23:03.132,What part of move on don't you get?
00:23:07.220,00:23:13.517,"After Mom died, when it was just you and me, I remember having trouble sleeping."
00:23:13.559,00:23:15.602,Never knowing where you were.
00:23:17.313,00:23:25.905,"But when I'd wake up in the morning, there'd be this paper bird, an origami crane, sitting next to my bed."
00:23:27.447,00:23:33.411,"And I never knew what it meant exactly, but I figured it was your way of letting me know you were checking in on me."
00:23:40.211,00:23:41.254,The crane.
00:23:43.463,00:23:48.426,It stands for familial obligation.
00:23:51.972,00:23:54.308,Maybe it's my turn to watch out for you.
00:24:01.523,00:24:07.780,"No, man, they're transferring me to a prison where I'll wait until they execute me."
00:24:08.530,00:24:09.615,Can I still visit?
00:24:09.656,00:24:13.451,Yeah. It ain't that far.
00:24:15.453,00:24:17.081,Fox River?
00:24:19.417,00:24:20.293,Why?
00:24:22.253,00:24:23.421,Nothing.
00:24:28.426,00:24:30.094,How come there's four?
00:24:31.678,00:24:33.513,"Well, um, Mommy's new friend is coming over for dinner again."
00:24:35.391,00:24:37.977,Again? He just came over last night.
00:24:38.978,00:24:40.354,I like him.
00:24:40.396,00:24:41.647,"Well, I do, too."
00:24:41.688,00:24:49.822,"And I want you both to be extra polite, because he's stopping by Malarkey's on his way home from work, and he's bringing us a really good meal."
00:24:50.864,00:24:53.784,"In fact, you two go wash your hands."
00:25:07.589,00:25:09.507,"Evening, Mrs. Hollander."
00:25:51.633,00:25:52.759,SUCRE: I'm gonna do it.
00:25:53.344,00:25:54.470,Do what?
00:25:55.429,00:25:56.680,I'm gonna propose to Maricruz.
00:25:56.722,00:25:59.058,Are you serious?
00:25:59.975,00:26:00.642,When?
00:26:01.643,00:26:03.103,As soon as I can afford the ring.
00:26:03.145,00:26:04.855,"So what, like 10, 20 years?"
00:26:07.066,00:26:10.277,"What's your problem, man?"
00:26:11.195,00:26:12.612,I'm just trying to protect you.
00:26:12.654,00:26:15.241,"What, you think you can give her everything she wants?"
00:26:15.282,00:26:16.825,Takes more than money to do that.
00:26:20.871,00:26:23.581,"You know I love you, coz."
00:26:28.670,00:26:30.630,Just think you should look at the reality here.
00:26:30.672,00:26:34.592,"Seriously, primo, how are you gonna afford a ring for a girl like that, huh?"
00:26:44.686,00:26:45.979,Open the door!
00:26:47.731,00:26:49.191,"Hey, this fine?"
00:26:50.650,00:26:52.652,"Actually, I'm gonna need a little bit more this time."
00:26:52.694,00:26:53.820,"Okay, okay."
00:26:57.699,00:26:58.742,Here you go.
00:27:02.329,00:27:03.956,I'm sorry.
00:27:29.982,00:27:32.859,Anyone asking questions?
00:27:32.901,00:27:34.320,Not loud enough to hear.
00:27:41.743,00:27:43.745,"School board, second term, 1992?"
00:27:48.208,00:27:50.961,"Secluded, no real access roads, perfect for what you're looking for."
00:27:53.755,00:27:55.882,What's that?
00:27:55.924,00:28:00.137,"Well, didn't my poor brother, Terrence, leave something for me in his will?"
00:28:00.179,00:28:03.056,"You'd have to ask your accountants, ma'am."
00:28:03.932,00:28:05.100,Tell them to use that money.
00:28:06.768,00:28:08.770,I'm paying for his mistake.
00:28:09.938,00:28:13.984,And I've been clean for 18 months now.
00:28:15.902,00:28:17.446,"I'll tell you, I've never been happier."
00:28:18.822,00:28:21.408,That actually might be the wrong word.
00:28:24.786,00:28:25.787,Um...
00:28:27.247,00:28:30.209,But what I feel is different now.
00:28:31.210,00:28:33.128,I feel joy.
00:28:36.131,00:28:37.757,So here I am.
00:28:37.799,00:28:42.221,I know that all I can do every day is the next right thing.
00:28:47.017,00:28:48.810,"I, uh..."
00:28:54.525,00:28:57.986,I want to help people get from where I've been to where I am.
00:29:00.822,00:29:02.366,"Hey, Sara."
00:29:03.242,00:29:04.910,"You used to be a doctor, right?"
00:29:05.827,00:29:06.953,"Uh, I still am, in theory. Why?"
00:29:12.084,00:29:12.876,Really? Where's that?
00:29:12.918,00:29:15.295,You ever heard of Fox River?
00:29:15.337,00:29:16.672,The prison?
00:29:16.714,00:29:18.882,Yeah. I know it sounds like a strange idea.
00:29:18.924,00:29:21.093,Maybe...
00:29:21.885,00:29:23.303,"Maybe you and I could, uh..."
00:29:24.513,00:29:25.847,Maybe we could talk about it over dinner.
00:29:25.889,00:29:29.226,I got a gift card to the Red Lobster over off the interstate.
00:29:30.852,00:29:33.939,"Um, thank you. Really."
00:29:33.980,00:29:36.609,"Uh, I..."
00:29:44.742,00:29:46.076,"Sorry, I, uh..."
00:29:47.703,00:29:49.871,"But--But thank you, really, for the, um... The referral."
00:29:49.913,00:29:52.124,Fox River.
00:30:52.142,00:30:54.936,"You know, math was never my best subject, either."
00:30:54.978,00:30:59.316,"But, uh, I got through it by learning some new tricks."
00:31:00.942,00:31:02.235,"You want to learn some tricks, Gracey?"
00:31:02.277,00:31:03.987,Like what?
00:31:06.072,00:31:09.868,Ready? Nine times one is...
00:31:10.327,00:31:11.077,Nine.
00:31:11.119,00:31:14.373,Nine times two is...
00:31:14.414,00:31:15.415,Eighteen.
00:31:16.416,00:31:19.127,Nine times three is...
00:31:19.169,00:31:21.338,Twenty-seven!
00:31:22.506,00:31:24.132,Exactly. You got it.
00:31:24.174,00:31:27.302,"Mommy, Mommy, did you see what Teddy taught me?"
00:31:27.344,00:31:29.971,"Yes. That's great, honey."
00:31:31.181,00:31:35.101,"Zack, look. Nine times one..."
00:31:36.186,00:31:37.688,Nine?
00:31:38.980,00:31:41.525,GRACEY: Nine times two?
00:31:42.359,00:31:45.111,Nine times three?

00:34:14.135,00:34:20.058,"I got to tell you something, and it's gonna be really hard to hear."
00:34:22.143,00:34:24.062,Okay.
00:34:33.363,00:34:34.531,What?
00:34:35.574,00:34:46.292,"Well, the thing is, I'm being shipped back off."
00:34:51.172,00:34:53.091,"My--My unit just got, uh, called back for another tour, baby."
00:34:58.179,00:34:59.138,"You know, with the Italians pulling out and everything."
00:34:59.180,00:35:02.059,"Tell them no, Daddy."
00:35:06.688,00:35:07.522,KAYCEE: Come here.
00:35:09.232,00:35:11.150,Can you give me a hand with something out back?
00:35:11.192,00:35:12.277,Okay.
00:35:24.163,00:35:26.124,That's my sister you lied to in there.
00:35:31.212,00:35:33.172,This is crazy.
00:35:33.214,00:35:37.135,Maybe. But so is the way I got kicked out of the Army.
00:35:37.176,00:35:40.472,So is the way I got busted for driving that truck.
00:35:41.974,00:35:44.434,And so is the way I feel about that woman up in there.
00:35:51.232,00:35:56.279,"Now if I look like one of these thugs, now, what do think she's going to do? Huh?"
00:35:56.321,00:35:59.449,How long do you think she's going to wait for me while I'm inside?
00:36:00.826,00:36:02.201,"I don't know, man."
00:36:04.245,00:36:05.872,"You owe me this, man."
00:36:07.248,00:36:10.418,Don't you ever let her know where I am.
00:36:11.252,00:36:12.420,Do you feel me?
00:36:50.291,00:36:52.836,"Usually, I do this the other way."
00:36:54.087,00:36:56.089,Why do you want to...
00:37:02.929,00:37:07.433,"You show this to anyone else, I am calling the whole thing off."
00:38:29.390,00:38:31.059,My therapist said...
00:38:32.435,00:38:40.693,She said that I'm holding too much in and that I need to confront you to let you know how betrayed I feel.
00:38:42.779,00:38:48.785,"I let you into my life, my home, my God, I let you near my children!"
00:38:48.827,00:38:50.287,I never touched them.
00:38:50.328,00:38:52.664,You should have told me what you were.
00:38:54.415,00:38:57.627,Y-You think that you're the only one who feels betrayed?
00:39:00.421,00:39:05.635,"I...loved you, Susan."
00:39:08.847,00:39:12.600,Real love. For the first time in my life.
00:39:19.316,00:39:24.279,"And then... And then to have you do me like that, to just throw me out to the dogs, just toss me out the back door..."
00:39:24.321,00:39:27.365,"You're a murderer, Teddy!"
00:39:31.410,00:39:39.627,"I have sinned in the past, but when I met you, that person, the one that did all those terrible things, he died."
00:39:40.461,00:39:41.838,And I was reborn.
00:39:43.464,00:39:45.800,"By the grace of your love, I was a..."
00:39:46.592,00:39:48.386,A new man. A better man.
00:39:53.474,00:39:57.187,That doesn't just erase the man who killed six students in Alabama.
00:40:01.649,00:40:03.776,I guess that's where you're right.
00:40:07.239,00:40:16.706,"Because when you sent me here to this place, with these people, it brought that old dirty bastard right back home."
00:40:17.957,00:40:27.466,"In fact, there was a candle in the window just waiting for me to walk up them front steps."
00:40:39.771,00:40:41.439,"You know, I'm gonna..."
00:40:46.611,00:40:57.455,"And when I do, don't think I won't remember what your front steps look like, Susan."
00:41:29.070,00:41:30.488,It's almost over.
00:41:31.823,00:41:35.493,Burrows will be dead soon and then things will start getting back to normal.
00:41:42.417,00:41:50.633,"I know that you've been through a lot, but I promise you the worst is now behind us."
00:42:04.439,00:42:11.446,"My dear sister, you have no idea what I've been through."
00:42:13.614,00:42:15.533,"Good night, Terrence."
00:00:01.293,00:00:10.135,MALE NARRATOR: Previously on Prison Break: LINCOLN: Did you see the guy in the viewing room?
00:00:10.177,00:00:11.929,SCOFIELD: No.
00:00:11.971,00:00:13.012,It was Dad.
00:00:15.098,00:00:16.600,I know that guy.
00:00:23.941,00:00:25.108,KATIE: What is it?
00:00:28.153,00:00:30.280,"As far as I can tell, a guard's uniform."
00:00:30.322,00:00:31.657,SUCRE: What's wrong?
00:00:47.130,00:00:49.048,"Hey, that's looking good."
00:00:50.133,00:00:51.844,You're making some real progress.
00:00:51.886,00:00:53.220,The plaster adds a lot of weight.
00:00:55.138,00:00:57.474,"Well, whatever it takes, as long as you get done in time for the anniversary."
00:00:57.516,00:00:59.267,It'll be done. Hold this.
00:01:01.770,00:01:07.317,"You know, the Shah loved his Taj so much that he built another temple just like it on the other side of the river."
00:01:07.359,00:01:08.736,It was an absolute mirror image.
00:01:08.777,00:01:11.697,"Except it was darker, it was like a black Taj Mahal."
00:01:12.239,00:01:13.532,Never heard of it.
00:01:13.574,00:01:15.659,"Well, that's 'cause it was never completed."
00:01:15.701,00:01:19.079,He was overthrown by his favorite son before he could finish it.
00:01:24.167,00:01:25.711,I think.
00:01:25.753,00:01:28.255,"Excuse me, Warden."
00:01:30.173,00:01:31.258,Thank you.
00:01:33.761,00:01:37.264,"POPE: Adams, please escort Mr. Scofield back to his cell."
00:01:41.184,00:01:42.978,"Doctor, what can I do for you?"
00:01:44.103,00:01:45.355,"Actually, it's about Scofield, sir."
00:01:46.941,00:01:48.108,Come in.
00:01:53.530,00:01:55.032,What about Scofield?
00:01:55.074,00:01:56.867,The burn on his back is fairly serious.
00:02:01.162,00:02:04.416,"At first, I assumed he was being assaulted by another inmate, but I found this embedded in the skin on his back."
00:02:04.458,00:02:06.752,What's this?
00:02:09.212,00:02:11.131,Came from a guard's uniform.
00:02:26.271,00:02:27.648,What are you doing?
00:02:27.689,00:02:33.153,"I'm trying to remember those blueprints, what we lost to the burn."
00:02:34.696,00:02:37.449,"Without them, we'll never be able to navigate those pipes beneath psych ward."
00:02:37.491,00:02:38.826,Any luck?
00:02:38.867,00:02:40.243,No.
00:02:42.621,00:02:52.255,"I spent a lot of time studying those blueprints, tracing them night after night, considering every possible route to the infirmary."
00:02:54.133,00:02:56.175,It's like trying to take a test you studied for 10 years ago.
00:03:03.642,00:03:04.977,PI!
00:03:15.821,00:03:18.239,"How do they get like that, I got no idea."
00:03:18.281,00:03:19.574,I do.
00:03:19.616,00:03:20.993,Tugging on too many pockets.
00:03:21.035,00:03:23.244,She tug on your pocket?
00:03:23.286,00:03:25.956,"I may be social, but that's the boundary line even I won't cross."
00:03:29.710,00:03:31.795,"So how about it, Fish?"
00:03:31.837,00:03:33.714,"One hiccup left, but I'm working on it."
00:03:33.755,00:03:35.256,"Yeah, and what is that?"
00:03:35.298,00:03:37.634,Our road map's a little incomplete at the moment.
00:03:40.303,00:03:42.681,I don't get it.
00:03:48.311,00:03:51.231,"And two, even if I did, it's a mess down there."
00:03:51.815,00:03:53.316,I need this.
00:03:54.317,00:03:55.276,You think you're gonna remember it?
00:03:55.318,00:03:56.236,Not with you hounding me.
00:04:02.325,00:04:04.703,Time to wrap it up.
00:04:04.745,00:04:06.580,We're not done in here.
00:04:06.621,00:04:08.040,"Well, you look done to me."
00:04:08.082,00:04:10.375,"No, CO, we still got the carpet to do, man."
00:04:10.417,00:04:12.627,"No, Bellick is going to bring professionals in to do that."
00:04:12.669,00:04:14.588,Wants the job done right.
00:04:14.629,00:04:15.839,When's that going to happen?
00:04:15.881,00:04:17.799,Tomorrow.
00:04:24.347,00:04:26.892,"We got a real problem on our hands, don't we?"
00:04:28.351,00:04:30.812,"Rug monkeys gonna come in here, tear up that carpet and that hole's gonna be smiling up at them."
00:04:30.854,00:04:33.648,We'll have to fill it in.
00:04:33.690,00:04:38.319,All we need is a piece of plywood and a couple inches of that fast-setting concrete on top of it.
00:04:38.361,00:04:40.321,The carpet guys will never know there's anything beneath it.
00:04:47.412,00:04:48.872,"Well, okay."
00:04:48.914,00:04:52.459,We've only got a couple hours to get this thing done.
00:04:58.506,00:05:00.884,"Hey, Tweener."
00:05:02.385,00:05:03.470,"Yo, what's up?"
00:05:04.387,00:05:07.682,Lookit. She's just a baby.
00:05:09.476,00:05:10.477,Hit road.
00:05:15.816,00:05:16.608,Have a seat.
00:05:24.866,00:05:27.244,What's the 911?
00:05:33.125,00:05:34.751,"You know, Avocado's looking for a new cellie."
00:05:34.793,00:05:39.422,"Boss, come on, man, I'm trying to break bread with the man, but I can't get jack unless I can get to the table."
00:05:39.464,00:05:41.175,You know what I'm saying?
00:05:41.216,00:05:42.843,Scofield got his own peeps up in PI.
00:05:42.884,00:05:44.343,He don't need me.
00:05:48.431,00:05:49.641,How long this stuff take to dry?
00:05:49.683,00:05:50.809,"One, 2 hours."
00:05:51.935,00:05:54.353,Fire on the line.
00:06:15.625,00:06:18.003,This place is sweet.
00:06:18.045,00:06:19.420,I heard we're getting satellite.
00:06:19.462,00:06:21.173,"Yeah, all the porn you can watch, boss."
00:06:21.215,00:06:23.424,"Good, good."
00:06:23.466,00:06:28.638,"You know, you girls have done such a good job, I thought you could use an extra pair of hands on the crew."
00:06:37.981,00:06:40.399,What's up?
00:07:26.529,00:07:28.656,"Hey, man, look at my brush."
00:07:28.698,00:07:30.491,Somebody needs to go clean them out.
00:07:38.625,00:07:40.168,What do I gotta do?
00:07:40.210,00:07:43.046,There's a hose out by the shed in the yard.
00:07:48.551,00:07:50.387,"Clean those, too."
00:07:51.471,00:07:53.473,All right.
00:08:16.455,00:08:17.414,Who is he?
00:08:21.584,00:08:23.544,He went rogue.
00:08:25.630,00:08:27.466,He's Burrows' father.
00:08:28.049,00:08:29.550,"Wait, wait, wait."
00:08:29.592,00:08:32.220,You picked the son of a Company man to be our patsy?
00:08:32.262,00:08:33.638,Did the Company know?
00:08:33.680,00:08:36.808,The Company did know.
00:08:37.809,00:08:38.935,How about you elaborate on that?
00:08:38.977,00:08:41.146,How about you stop with all the questions?
00:08:41.188,00:08:44.816,"You are a glorified bodyguard, that's it."
00:08:46.609,00:08:48.278,Is that understood?
00:08:55.618,00:08:57.745,How close are we?
00:08:57.787,00:08:59.206,"Oh, we're good to go, baby."
00:08:59.747,00:09:01.166,Got another badge.
00:09:01.208,00:09:02.792,"What is this, happy hour?"
00:09:14.388,00:09:17.349,Scofield?
00:09:17.391,00:09:19.684,"The rest of you round up, you're done in here."
00:09:19.726,00:09:23.604,"Hey, CO Patterson said we had till the end of the day to finish up."
00:09:23.646,00:09:25.106,And I say you're done.
00:09:25.148,00:09:28.776,There's a couple hours of work I want done in the yard before sundown.
00:09:30.195,00:09:31.196,"Come on, let's go."
00:09:33.614,00:09:34.615,We're dead.
00:09:36.617,00:09:37.827,It's gotta be done tonight.
00:09:37.869,00:09:38.786,I said I'll get it done.
00:09:38.828,00:09:41.039,"Scofield, Pope's waiting."
00:09:50.215,00:09:51.758,You going to let me out?
00:09:51.799,00:09:54.635,"No, Linc, just came to let you know they set a new date."
00:09:57.680,00:09:59.640,Execution's a week from Friday at midnight.
00:09:59.682,00:10:01.642,You going to let me out in the yard or what?
00:10:01.684,00:10:03.895,"Unless I hear it from the Pope himself, I can't do it. I'm sorry."
00:10:03.937,00:10:06.231,"Come on, man, 10 minutes."
00:10:06.273,00:10:07.357,10 minutes.
00:10:08.567,00:10:09.776,I'm sorry.
00:10:22.372,00:10:25.666,"Who do you think it could be, some anti-death penalty fanatic?"
00:10:25.708,00:10:27.752,"Oh, come on, in this case, I doubt it."
00:10:27.794,00:10:30.505,"VERONICA: But without a name or a paper trail, we got no way of getting to him."
00:10:30.547,00:10:32.215,So once again we have nothing.
00:10:33.716,00:10:35.343,"I wouldn't exactly call a two-week stay nothing, okay?"
00:10:35.385,00:10:36.677,It's more than we had yesterday.
00:10:36.719,00:10:38.346,Can I ask you a question?
00:10:38.388,00:10:41.099,Do you really think that you're going to get to the bottom of this?
00:10:41.141,00:10:43.226,That they'll let you get to the bottom of this?
00:10:43.268,00:10:44.936,These guys don't exist.
00:10:44.978,00:10:48.648,"You go after them with the law, and they'll just use it against you."
00:10:48.689,00:10:51.234,"We're doing the best we can, okay?"
00:10:51.276,00:10:53.694,"Law's the only way we're going to bring them to justice, LJ."
00:10:53.736,00:10:55.155,"They gunned my mother down, man."
00:10:55.196,00:10:56.697,You think I give a damn about justice?
00:10:56.739,00:10:59.909,I want them.
00:10:59.951,00:11:01.702,"Oh, come on, LJ."
00:11:01.744,00:11:03.121,"It's for the courts to decide, not us."
00:11:03.163,00:11:04.956,"Look, they're going to slip up, okay?"
00:11:04.998,00:11:07.083,They're going to leave a piece of evidence that can't be refuted.
00:11:12.755,00:11:14.215,Maybe they already slipped up.
00:11:15.049,00:11:17.260,"Up at the cabin, at the well."
00:11:18.136,00:11:19.179,Quinn.
00:11:21.181,00:11:22.098,Somebody covered it up.
00:11:22.140,00:11:24.142,They must have come and gotten him.
00:11:25.018,00:11:27.270,There's only one way to find out.
00:11:38.906,00:11:39.740,"Look, there's his cell phone."
00:11:44.996,00:11:46.247,Easy.
00:11:50.544,00:11:51.794,"Okay, a little lower!"
00:11:51.836,00:11:54.130,A little more.
00:12:00.803,00:12:01.720,"Okay, I got it."
00:12:11.814,00:12:12.773,You okay?
00:12:13.774,00:12:14.942,"Yeah, I'm fine."
00:12:31.125,00:12:32.960,"Would you give us a minute, Gary?"
00:12:34.837,00:12:38.841,"Michael, I want you to be absolutely honest with me."
00:12:38.883,00:12:46.807,Dr. Tancredi found this embedded in your flesh when she was treating you.
00:12:46.849,00:12:49.018,"Apparently, it came from a guard's uniform."
00:12:50.144,00:12:50.769,Have you been assaulted by an officer?
00:12:54.232,00:12:59.320,"Michael, Michael, I need an answer."
00:13:02.156,00:13:04.951,This is about officer misconduct.
00:13:04.992,00:13:06.911,"You wouldn't want to see me lose my job now, would you?"
00:13:06.953,00:13:08.663,"No, of course not."
00:13:08.705,00:13:11.082,You have been very good to me and my brother.
00:13:11.124,00:13:13.876,Then I need to know where you got that burn.
00:13:15.920,00:13:18.005,"Otherwise, your ass is going to solitary."
00:13:20.133,00:13:21.551,It's your choice.
00:13:22.885,00:13:26.765,Don't...
00:13:26.805,00:13:27.848,Cool down!
00:13:27.890,00:13:29.934,"Listen to me, don't do this!"
00:13:32.895,00:13:34.981,Michael!
00:13:36.190,00:13:37.233,No!
00:13:51.914,00:13:53.291,Michael?
00:13:55.918,00:13:57.170,LINCOLN: Michael?
00:13:57.962,00:13:59.005,Michael?
00:14:05.928,00:14:07.305,What the hell are you doing in here?
00:14:09.098,00:14:12.018,"Linc, we're in a lot of trouble now."
00:14:12.935,00:14:13.894,LINCOLN: What happened?
00:14:13.936,00:14:19.025,The Pope asked some questions that I couldn't answer.
00:14:19.066,00:14:20.860,About what?
00:14:22.362,00:14:25.782,He's got proof that I was where I wasn't supposed to be.
00:14:30.161,00:14:31.120,There's no way out of this.
00:14:31.954,00:14:33.373,"Yeah, there is."
00:14:33.414,00:14:34.915,LINCOLN: You just got to keep the faith.
00:14:34.957,00:14:35.916,No.
00:14:39.962,00:14:41.130,Listen to me.
00:14:45.385,00:14:48.179,"You got to keep strong, you hear me?"
00:14:51.349,00:14:52.892,I put my blood into this.
00:14:58.022,00:15:01.776,"Look, baby, I--I'm so sorry it took me so long to get back to you."
00:15:02.610,00:15:05.988,Turns out that our division is not getting mobilized for a couple more days.
00:15:07.907,00:15:09.325,"When I didn't hear from you, I didn't know what to think, baby."
00:15:09.367,00:15:13.120,"I got so worried. I--I--I started watching the news, looking for casualties."
00:15:14.581,00:15:15.998,I'm so sorry about all this.
00:15:17.375,00:15:23.423,"I started calling the rear detachment office, asking if there was some sort of problem with the 117th."
00:15:27.093,00:15:28.010,No.
00:15:30.012,00:15:32.557,W-we're coming back.
00:15:32.599,00:15:34.975,"A couple more days, and we'll be on those hops, baby."
00:15:38.938,00:15:41.982,He said the 117th wasn't coming home for another 6 months.
00:15:42.024,00:15:45.986,"What? Um, no."
00:15:46.028,00:15:47.405,That's what he said.
00:15:48.072,00:15:50.074,"Oh, you know what it is?"
00:15:51.033,00:15:52.535,It's because we're transpo.
00:15:52.577,00:15:55.413,"You know, technically we're on a loan-out from the 140th."
00:15:55.455,00:15:57.039,"I mean, that's why he said that."
00:15:57.707,00:15:59.083,The 140th?
00:15:59.125,00:16:00.167,"Yeah, yeah."
00:16:01.711,00:16:03.421,It's just a few more days.
00:16:07.717,00:16:09.135,"I'll be back, okay?"
00:16:09.176,00:16:13.139,I will call you as soon as I know the exact date.
00:16:13.973,00:16:15.015,Okay?
00:16:15.057,00:16:17.059,I love you.
00:16:17.101,00:16:18.185,I love you.
00:16:30.239,00:16:32.742,Michael's in the SHU.
00:16:32.784,00:16:34.452,"Oh, God, the hits just keep coming!"
00:16:35.745,00:16:38.038,"Last thing we wanna do now is panic, fellas."
00:16:40.082,00:16:44.545,We got an unfinished hole in that room over there that Scofield was supposed to fill tonight.
00:16:44.587,00:16:48.967,"Come tomorrow 8:00 a.m., they rip up that carpet, our game is over."
00:16:49.801,00:16:51.010,Unless someone else fills it.
00:16:58.100,00:16:59.978,You're saying I go out there by myself tonight?
00:17:00.019,00:17:01.103,That's exactly what we're saying.
00:17:03.147,00:17:05.065,"Look, I don't wanna hear impossible from you right now!"
00:17:05.107,00:17:09.278,"I got people waiting on me, people that I'm gonna lose, unless you man up and get some cojones, comprende?"
00:17:09.320,00:17:10.864,"That's easy for you to say, pendejo."
00:17:18.496,00:17:21.207,"Yeah, maybe I can get out of my cell."
00:17:21.248,00:17:23.083,And maybe I can get into the guards' room.
00:17:23.125,00:17:27.296,"But even if I do, and I fill that hole in, I'll still be in that room."
00:17:27.338,00:17:29.089,I'll be sealed in.
00:17:29.131,00:17:31.592,Scofield must've had a way.
00:17:32.468,00:17:33.928,He did.
00:17:33.970,00:17:35.262,The grate at the sally port.
00:17:35.304,00:17:37.682,"Oh, that's right."
00:17:37.724,00:17:41.895,"Yeah, so you better lace up, amigo, 'cause you're gonna have to make a run for it."
00:17:43.145,00:17:44.188,That's 10 years on my bid if I get caught.
00:17:44.230,00:17:46.190,Then you better figure out a way not to get caught.
00:17:46.232,00:17:48.067,GUARD: Line it up!
00:17:50.862,00:17:53.573,"Tonight, primo."
00:18:33.362,00:18:36.074,LINCOLN: Michael. You okay?
00:18:37.324,00:18:38.242,What you doing?
00:18:41.203,00:18:44.248,You're thinking about the wrong thing.
00:18:44.290,00:18:46.125,You got to think about how to get out of here.
00:19:21.243,00:19:23.287,Michael.
00:19:26.290,00:19:29.168,"Man, come on. Talk to me."
00:19:55.277,00:19:57.363,Uh-uh. Absolutely not.
00:20:09.249,00:20:10.250,"I mean, you know what you're asking of me?"
00:20:10.292,00:20:12.753,You gotta do it for the team.
00:20:25.307,00:20:27.894,"Hey, sister."
00:20:33.315,00:20:37.028,I take it you are a party girl.
00:21:01.343,00:21:03.179,"LJ? Come on, we're leaving."
00:21:03.221,00:21:04.263,Okay.
00:21:08.350,00:21:11.729,We get Quinn's phone powered up and it could be a gold mine of information.
00:21:13.272,00:21:14.481,No. Doesn't fit.
00:21:14.523,00:21:16.275,We just need to find the right adapter.
00:21:17.902,00:21:19.237,What about Quinn?
00:21:20.320,00:21:21.280,You mean the guy who shot me in the back?
00:21:22.615,00:21:24.867,"Yeah, we're just gonna leave him here."
00:21:35.377,00:21:37.671,"about this, and I..."
00:21:42.218,00:21:46.222,Capitol Hill saw its first deadlock of the term on the Senate floor this morning.
00:21:46.264,00:21:49.433,The hotly contested energy bill ended up in a 50-50 tie.
00:21:49.475,00:21:53.771,That means it will now be up to Vice President Reynolds to cast the deciding vote.
00:21:56.398,00:22:00.236,"You need to get out, hang out with your friends more."
00:22:00.278,00:22:01.361,What about men?
00:22:02.446,00:22:05.365,"If this is your expose on my social life, it's about to be a real sad one."
00:22:05.407,00:22:07.118,"I, uh..."
00:22:08.577,00:22:09.578,I've had some bad luck when it comes to relationships.
00:22:09.620,00:22:13.124,You had bad luck or you had bad boys?
00:22:17.586,00:22:19.255,"Yeah, you know, you're right."
00:22:19.297,00:22:20.756,I--I don't tend to go for the nice guys.
00:22:20.798,00:22:25.094,I like the ones with the deep-seated emotional issues I can internalize and make my own.
00:22:25.136,00:22:26.262,Mmm-hmm.
00:22:26.304,00:22:27.387,Like Scofield?
00:22:27.429,00:22:29.598,"Nope, not like Scofield."
00:22:29.640,00:22:31.225,Don't lie to me.
00:22:31.267,00:22:35.437,"Every time he comes in for his shot, you spend 20 minutes rolling up his sleeve."
00:22:35.479,00:22:37.606,You know what?
00:22:39.441,00:22:41.401,"And I think he's attractive, but he's still an inmate."
00:22:41.443,00:22:44.864,I can promise you one thing.
00:22:41.443,00:22:47.365,And that's that you will never see anything happen between me and an inmate.
00:23:44.215,00:23:45.423,Michael.
00:23:46.675,00:23:48.552,I put my blood into this.
00:23:48.594,00:23:52.390,What? What'd you say?
00:23:56.518,00:23:58.396,I put my blood into this.
00:26:38.680,00:26:40.099,GUARD: Stop!
00:26:40.140,00:26:41.975,Get down on your knees!
00:26:42.017,00:26:45.145,Please don't shoot!
00:26:58.075,00:27:02.371,You know the state of Illinois doesn't look too kindly upon prisoners who try to escape.
00:27:09.711,00:27:13.757,"Charges are filed, you get sent back to county for 3 months."
00:27:13.799,00:27:15.675,Come back here with 10 more years added to your bid.
00:27:15.717,00:27:18.095,I wasn't trying to escape.
00:27:18.137,00:27:19.430,Sure you weren't.
00:27:19.472,00:27:22.808,You were just out there howling at the moon.
00:27:26.728,00:27:31.609,"If I were you, I'd better start talking, mano."
00:27:34.445,00:27:35.653,I stayed out after yard today.
00:27:35.695,00:27:38.656,I waited under the bleachers until it got dark.
00:27:38.698,00:27:41.327,Something was gonna come over the walls.
00:27:42.744,00:27:48.083,Last guy had heroin slingshot over the wall got a nickel added to his bid.
00:27:52.045,00:27:53.130,Frisk him!
00:28:00.762,00:28:03.265,What do we have here?
00:28:12.316,00:28:13.567,A pair of grunds?
00:28:14.776,00:28:17.695,You risked going to the SHU for a pair of grunds?
00:28:18.780,00:28:21.950,"Hell, you risked adding extra time to your bid, all for a pair of panties?"
00:28:21.992,00:28:24.702,"My girl just wanted me to know she was thinking about me, boss."
00:28:26.746,00:28:29.749,"You got a real beefer on your hands, don't you?"
00:28:32.794,00:28:37.007,"I'm-- I'm just scared that being here, I'm gonna lose her."
00:28:38.217,00:28:39.176,He did it for love.
00:28:39.843,00:28:41.761,Then you understand.
00:28:41.803,00:28:46.559,"Yeah, sure, Sucre."
00:28:53.607,00:28:56.776,"Don't let me catch you alone next time, okay?"
00:28:59.196,00:29:00.780,Sucre!
00:29:03.992,00:29:05.536,Sucre.
00:29:08.830,00:29:09.789,Other side of you.
00:29:20.926,00:29:22.886,SUCRE: Michael!
00:29:22.928,00:29:25.431,"Michael, come on."
00:29:27.849,00:29:29.142,Badge!
00:29:33.855,00:29:34.981,Yeah?
00:29:36.233,00:29:37.901,Check out my brother.
00:29:37.943,00:29:39.069,What?
00:29:47.994,00:29:49.246,Scofield.
00:29:58.880,00:30:00.799,I need a medic in 12 now.
00:30:03.927,00:30:07.847,There's an electronics store on Eighth Avenue.
00:30:07.889,00:30:08.974,We'll be back in 10 minutes.
00:30:09.015,00:30:10.809,Stay on the couch.
00:30:53.352,00:30:55.562,"Hi, you've reached Owen Kravecki."
00:30:55.604,00:30:56.896,I can't come to the phone right now.
00:31:02.944,00:31:05.698,Thanks. Have a great day.
00:31:10.619,00:31:12.162,Light on 12.
00:31:25.008,00:31:27.010,"Would you wait outside, please?"
00:31:48.615,00:31:50.158,"Come on, I need your eyes."
00:31:59.918,00:32:02.128,I'm going to take a look at that hand.
00:32:12.013,00:32:13.724,You're going to be okay.
00:32:14.474,00:32:16.101,You're going to be okay.
00:32:28.781,00:32:30.949,Sucre got...
00:32:51.094,00:32:52.471,REYNOLDS: Make it fast.
00:32:52.512,00:32:56.516,I thought we picked Lincoln Burrows off the street because he was some lowlife who couldn't defend himself.
00:32:56.558,00:33:01.104,"Now I learn it's all about his father, some old spook that the Company's trying to settle a score with?"
00:33:06.067,00:33:13.032,"Caroline, I've been doing this for 15 years, and it's never been about anything other than you, your family, and most importantly, this country."
00:33:13.074,00:33:16.035,"Now, I need to know who I'm working for here."
00:33:16.077,00:33:17.955,You are working for me.
00:33:19.706,00:33:21.124,Promise me that.
00:33:21.166,00:33:24.711,"I promise you, Paul."
00:33:33.178,00:33:35.013,To the vote on the Senate floor this afternoon.
00:33:35.889,00:33:37.557,"Look, I get it."
00:33:37.599,00:33:40.936,"The vote comes down to me, I vote no."
00:33:40.978,00:33:46.024,"Well, actually, we are going to need you to vote yes on this one."
00:33:51.112,00:33:54.115,You want me to vote on the environmentalists' side?
00:33:54.157,00:33:56.201,This isn't about a vote.
00:33:56.242,00:33:59.120,This is about you and how you look to voters.
00:33:59.162,00:34:03.124,"Now, we have a nation that is growing increasingly hungry for alternate energy."
00:34:03.166,00:34:11.049,"So if you come across as more centrist, you'll appeal to the broader swath of the electorate, the very people who will get you elected next year."
00:34:14.177,00:34:17.222,"Besides, once that bill hits the President's desk, he'll veto it."
00:34:17.263,00:34:21.100,"Then we'll get precisely what we always wanted anyway, won't we?"
00:34:28.149,00:34:32.571,"You probably don't have a hair on your body, do you?"
00:34:36.157,00:34:39.786,"Hey, Tweener! Get over here."
00:34:53.174,00:34:55.218,I could set you up as cellies if you want.
00:34:55.260,00:34:57.220,"Stop it, all right?"
00:34:59.180,00:35:01.140,I got something for you this time.
00:35:03.184,00:35:06.312,How about being a little more specific?
00:35:08.065,00:35:10.108,"Whatever it is, it's got to do with that room they're fixing."
00:35:11.192,00:35:12.861,Something to do with the carpet.
00:35:36.093,00:35:37.970,"Excuse me, fellas."
00:35:39.262,00:35:41.056,Out of the way!
00:36:31.439,00:36:33.066,Michael!
00:36:34.943,00:36:37.195,Michael! Michael!
00:38:00.278,00:38:02.989,"SARA: He's totally non-responsive, so start him on chlorpromazine."
00:38:03.031,00:38:04.699,And I believe he's in danger of a psychotic break.
00:38:04.741,00:38:07.035,I want you to notify me immediately if and when that happens.
00:38:07.077,00:38:08.327,GUARD: All right.
00:38:08.369,00:38:09.495,Come on.
00:38:10.538,00:38:14.292,Come this way. Come on.
00:38:14.333,00:38:15.501,Watch your step.
00:38:23.301,00:38:24.427,Clean him up.
00:39:22.694,00:39:25.280,You scared me.
00:39:28.407,00:39:30.660,"You don't want to make any rash mistakes here, LJ."
00:39:33.454,00:39:34.413,Don't move!
00:39:34.455,00:39:35.581,"Go easy, go easy..."
00:39:35.623,00:39:37.876,Shut up!
00:39:39.460,00:39:40.545,"LJ, there's other ways out of this, you know, okay?"
00:39:40.586,00:39:46.425,"I can help you beat this rap, but if you pull that trigger, you really will be a killer, and then I can't help you, okay?"
00:39:46.467,00:39:48.636,"I'm government, LJ."
00:39:51.472,00:39:52.431,Drop your weapon!
00:39:54.226,00:39:55.935,I said drop your weapon!
00:40:03.401,00:40:05.403,COP: Drop the gun now!
00:40:19.292,00:40:21.419,No. I did what you said.
00:40:23.004,00:40:25.382,BELLICK: You brought me a pile of crap.
00:40:25.423,00:40:26.591,"Boss, come on, man."
00:40:26.632,00:40:29.928,You had your time.
00:40:34.640,00:40:36.475,"Boss, come on, man!"
00:40:38.519,00:40:40.438,"Dude, just give me another try."
00:40:44.192,00:40:46.444,Close on 88!
00:40:58.456,00:40:59.457,Boss!
00:41:03.628,00:41:05.130,COP: You're lucky.
00:41:05.171,00:41:07.048,Kid's got a warrant for double homicide.
00:41:07.799,00:41:09.217,"Oh, dear. Are you serious?"
00:41:09.259,00:41:10.551,Did you have any prior contact with him?
00:41:10.593,00:41:12.511,Any idea why he chose your house?
00:41:12.553,00:41:19.518,"I mean, he was screaming something like, You killed my mom, and going on about me being a government agent, and..."
00:41:19.560,00:41:22.647,"I don't know, it just seemed like that kid was on drugs or something."
00:41:22.688,00:41:24.649,"What do you do for a living, Mr. Kravecki?"
00:41:24.690,00:41:28.653,I'm a regional sales manager for a dehydrated meat distributor.
00:41:32.531,00:41:33.532,What kind?
00:41:33.574,00:41:34.659,Buffalo.
00:41:37.870,00:41:40.373,Have some. Really.
00:41:53.594,00:41:54.512,One hour till lunch.
00:42:04.439,00:42:06.649,"So, what's the problem?"
00:42:06.691,00:42:08.151,You're looking at it.
00:42:08.193,00:42:09.235,"ABRUZZI: What, Haywire?"
00:42:09.277,00:42:10.987,Yep. He's my new cellmate.
00:42:11.029,00:42:14.657,They think I have schizoaffective disorder with bipolar tendencies.
00:42:24.459,00:42:26.752,HAYWIRE: Your tattoos.
00:42:26.794,00:42:28.587,What are they of?
00:42:28.629,00:42:31.716,The man's got a maze on his skin.
00:42:31.757,00:42:33.343,Why would he put a maze on his skin?
00:42:33.385,00:42:36.471,It's a pathway.
00:42:40.225,00:42:41.559,"Hello, roomie."
00:42:42.768,00:42:44.521,You were right about my tattoo.
00:42:44.562,00:42:48.316,"It is a path, just like you thought."
00:42:48.358,00:42:51.569,"And I need you to remember when you saw it, Haywire."
00:42:52.737,00:42:54.739,I need you to remember what it looked like.
00:42:55.781,00:42:56.741,Do you think you can do that for me?
00:43:00.161,00:43:02.205,Who are you?
00:00:01.168,00:00:04.922,SCOFIELD: Previously on Prison Break: SUCRE: What are you doing?
00:00:04.964,00:00:07.675,"I'm trying to remember those blueprints, what we lost to the burn."
00:00:08.717,00:00:11.010,"Without them, we'll never be able to navigate those pipes beneath psych ward."
00:00:12.513,00:00:15.140,Then I need to know where you got that burn.
00:00:15.182,00:00:18.101,"Otherwise, your ass is going to solitary."
00:00:21.563,00:00:23.398,How about you stop with all the questions?
00:00:31.114,00:00:32.867,KELLERMAN: Put it down.
00:00:34.117,00:00:35.410,Get out of the way.
00:00:37.162,00:00:41.208,Yeah. To keep me in their invisible freaking handcuffs.
00:00:43.126,00:00:46.087,You were right about my tattoo.
00:00:50.133,00:00:51.050,Who are you?
00:01:07.150,00:01:10.070,Officer Bellick assigned you to my cell.
00:01:12.155,00:01:14.324,"I have a tattoo, you drew it."
00:01:17.160,00:01:21.957,"Haywire, do I look even vaguely familiar to you?"
00:01:30.758,00:01:33.427,Are you the guy who stole my toothpaste?
00:01:39.182,00:01:40.809,So you do remember.
00:01:48.943,00:01:49.401,Mr. Scofield.
00:01:50.736,00:01:51.152,"No, thank you."
00:01:52.571,00:01:54.155,Medication is mandatory.
00:01:54.197,00:01:57.158,It's just a mild sedative prescribed by Dr. Tancredi.
00:02:01.204,00:02:03.164,"Oh, really? That's great."
00:02:07.419,00:02:09.129,I'm fine. Thank you.
00:02:10.213,00:02:13.174,"Carter, could you come here a sec?"
00:02:13.216,00:02:15.636,Scofield went J-Cat?
00:02:15.677,00:02:16.845,Sure did.
00:02:16.887,00:02:19.180,I knew he was gonna crack first time I saw him.
00:02:19.222,00:02:21.182,So he's not coming back here?
00:02:23.226,00:02:25.104,What about Sucre?
00:02:33.278,00:02:38.075,"We promise to keep it a single for a couple of months, auction it off."
00:02:38.492,00:02:39.159,Make it happen.
00:02:45.165,00:02:47.208,I don't need medication.
00:03:01.264,00:03:02.181,Nice.
00:03:22.285,00:03:24.079,"You were right, Haywire."
00:03:39.302,00:03:41.221,"Middle cell, cool in the summer, warm in the winter."
00:03:47.686,00:03:50.271,$200. We got a deal?
00:03:52.066,00:03:54.735,Deal.
00:03:57.320,00:04:00.824,"Hey, man, the toilet's leaking."
00:04:15.338,00:04:18.050,Already been moved.
00:04:18.092,00:04:19.218,Ain't that Scofield's cell?
00:04:19.259,00:04:20.677,Not anymore.
00:04:21.344,00:04:22.054,Close on 40!
00:05:03.303,00:05:04.805,C-NOTE: Is that your daughter?
00:05:06.389,00:05:08.391,My wife gave me this when she was born.
00:05:18.401,00:05:19.444,Outliving your daughter...
00:05:21.280,00:05:23.782,No man should have to endure that.
00:05:27.410,00:05:28.369,How long does she have?
00:05:28.411,00:05:32.791,"Hospital says a week, maybe two."
00:05:35.669,00:05:36.335,We got us a problem.
00:05:37.879,00:05:41.300,"Mojo's moving into Scofield's cell, and that ain't all."
00:05:42.425,00:05:45.344,"He's bitching about the toilet, so Geary's putting in a work order."
00:05:46.596,00:05:47.388,They move that toilet...
00:05:47.430,00:05:50.058,We are all screwed.
00:06:01.820,00:06:03.238,I hear you got a cell.
00:06:04.447,00:06:08.367,"And if you were smart, you'd keep quiet about that."
00:06:10.287,00:06:12.164,I'm getting $250.
00:06:12.206,00:06:14.166,$500? Ain't a problem.
00:06:14.208,00:06:16.293,I ain't talking cigarettes and extra chow line desserts here.
00:06:16.335,00:06:20.421,I'm talking green paper with dead white guys on it.
00:06:39.482,00:06:41.026,Come on.
00:06:41.484,00:06:43.070,Where?
00:06:43.111,00:06:43.402,It's a surprise.
00:06:59.502,00:07:00.461,I don't wear a diaper.
00:07:00.503,00:07:02.964,I never said you did.
00:07:05.092,00:07:07.969,You got something in your teeth.
00:07:10.555,00:07:12.891,I don't...
00:07:15.518,00:07:17.020,Come on.
00:07:20.523,00:07:23.193,Why are you doing this?
00:07:23.693,00:07:24.278,I am helping you.
00:07:28.031,00:07:30.200,Invisible handcuffs.
00:07:30.242,00:07:33.453,Handcuffs on your mind.
00:07:47.550,00:07:49.510,You got a phone call.
00:07:49.552,00:07:51.471,Your son. It's an emergency.
00:07:54.057,00:07:56.726,"Oh, LJ, what were you thinking, kid?"
00:07:59.562,00:08:01.606,They won. They'll always win.
00:08:06.320,00:08:07.988,Put Veronica back on.
00:08:10.573,00:08:11.950,Lincoln?
00:08:13.368,00:08:14.202,What are the charges?
00:08:14.244,00:08:16.204,Attempted murder.
00:08:16.246,00:08:19.540,He's also being arraigned for the murder of his mother and his stepfather.
00:08:19.582,00:08:20.250,LINCOLN: I guess bail is out of the question?
00:08:20.292,00:08:22.836,Exactly.
00:08:28.591,00:08:30.218,But he needs to show some remorse.
00:08:30.260,00:08:32.471,I need to sell to the court that he was just a scared kid.
00:08:32.512,00:08:34.055,"But where his head's at right now, he won't listen to me."
00:08:34.097,00:08:36.933,He'll listen to me.
00:08:36.975,00:08:39.353,"Lincoln, there's no way."
00:08:39.394,00:08:41.521,"He gets tried as an adult, he may as well sit in my lap in the chair."
00:08:42.647,00:08:44.316,"You got to do something, Veronica."
00:08:44.358,00:08:45.566,Okay.
00:08:45.608,00:08:49.529,"Look, I'll petition the DOC, but it's a million-to-one shot they're gonna let you out to see him."
00:08:51.823,00:08:52.449,All right.
00:08:56.453,00:08:58.079,"Yo, Trumpets."
00:08:59.956,00:09:03.710,"You all gotta round up all outstanding debts that are due ASAP, all right?"
00:09:04.627,00:09:06.713,"Like yesterday, all right?"
00:09:06.754,00:09:08.548,I'll put it out there.
00:09:45.668,00:09:48.380,You are now a witness in his criminal investigation.
00:09:48.422,00:09:50.215,I can still do my job.
00:09:50.257,00:09:53.218,You are not to make a move on Burrows under any circumstance.
00:09:53.260,00:09:54.177,We make that call.
00:09:55.262,00:09:57.597,"You know what, trixie?"
00:09:58.681,00:10:01.142,There are actually higher agendas here.
00:10:01.184,00:10:05.188,"Yes, there are, and they don't belong to you."
00:10:08.066,00:10:12.070,You're just good old Owen Kravecki from now on.
00:10:13.154,00:10:14.614,Have I made myself clear?
00:10:23.123,00:10:26.251,I need you to focus.
00:10:40.807,00:10:46.271,ORDERLY: Haywire. Time for group.
00:10:47.021,00:10:48.356,There we go.
00:10:53.945,00:10:56.656,Yes. It is a path.
00:10:58.158,00:10:59.409,Let's go.
00:11:16.176,00:11:17.802,"So, what's up, man?"
00:11:17.844,00:11:20.597,Here's the thing.
00:11:24.184,00:11:25.519,Is that so?
00:11:25.560,00:11:29.606,"You got a problem with it, go cry to your new crew, T-Bag and the white boys."
00:11:30.773,00:11:34.194,"Oh. Okay, so that's what this is all about."
00:11:34.235,00:11:36.737,This is about staying true to your own.
00:11:36.779,00:11:37.947,"Well, you know what, man?"
00:11:37.989,00:11:44.496,"I can have tea with the grand wizard of the KKK if I want, and I still get my money."
00:11:44.538,00:11:45.913,"You got that, little boy?"
00:11:45.955,00:11:48.124,No. We don't got that.
00:11:49.376,00:11:52.420,"Now, out of respect for what you once were, I'm gonna let you walk away."
00:13:02.781,00:13:03.824,You were right.
00:13:05.910,00:13:07.995,The pills don't let me see the pathway.
00:13:19.340,00:13:21.301,That's a pathway to hell.
00:13:21.342,00:13:24.429,"No, it's not."
00:13:40.528,00:13:41.904,I remember.
00:13:53.500,00:13:55.126,Looks like the Bank of Africa wasn't allowing any withdrawals.
00:13:55.168,00:13:57.878,"Look, we are gonna have to find another way to get that money, okay?"
00:13:57.920,00:14:03.259,"Well, then I reckon it ain't too much of a problem for our friend here to rummage up, ain't that so, D.B.?"
00:14:03.301,00:14:09.265,"A, I'm not D.B. Cooper, and, B, there's no visitation today."
00:14:13.936,00:14:16.897,I guess that only leaves us with one real option.
00:14:17.940,00:14:18.399,The kitchen game.
00:14:22.403,00:14:24.364,"Uh, son, trust me."
00:14:29.076,00:14:32.079,There's maybe five people in this country that can do what I do with a deck of cards.
00:14:32.121,00:14:34.248,So why are you just bringing this up now?
00:14:54.894,00:14:56.521,You sit right here.
00:14:58.022,00:14:59.315,There you go. Take this.
00:15:04.987,00:15:06.155,And this.
00:15:17.417,00:15:19.960,"Oh, no. It's gone."
00:15:20.002,00:15:21.796,That's why I need you to fix it.
00:15:21.838,00:15:24.465,That's why I need you to remember what was there before.
00:15:24.507,00:15:26.426,"Oh, this is bad."
00:15:26.467,00:15:28.969,Then it doesn't lead anywhere.
00:15:29.011,00:15:30.638,That's right.
00:15:30.680,00:15:33.933,That's why I need you to remember what was there before it was broken.
00:15:40.064,00:15:41.941,"Wait, no, maybe they were pilgrims."
00:15:41.982,00:15:44.360,"They were pointing to the way, and they were saying, This is the way, this is the way."
00:15:49.031,00:15:50.950,"I can see it, but I can't see it."
00:15:52.952,00:15:53.953,I'll be right back.
00:16:06.048,00:16:08.301,"Tell him I'm okay, and that I'm trying to fill in the blanks."
00:16:08.342,00:16:11.011,He'll know what that means.
00:16:11.053,00:16:13.055,You're trying to fill in the blanks?
00:16:13.097,00:16:15.057,Just do it. Please.
00:16:28.070,00:16:30.072,What the hell am I gonna do now?
00:16:37.163,00:16:39.290,You've been down in 13 as long as I can remember.
00:16:39.332,00:16:42.042,Why the sudden interest in moving?
00:16:42.084,00:16:46.005,Second-story units like this don't come on the market too much.
00:16:51.678,00:16:52.219,Open on 40!
00:16:55.890,00:16:57.266,Make it quick.
00:17:12.699,00:17:16.118,"Hey, Bob Vila, it's a cell."
00:17:17.370,00:17:18.621,Quit kicking the tires and make a decision.
00:17:18.663,00:17:21.457,I'll give you 100 bucks for it.
00:17:21.499,00:17:24.126,You wasted my time.
00:17:24.168,00:17:26.379,"Sorry, boss."
00:17:28.130,00:17:29.757,Close on 40!
00:17:46.733,00:17:47.483,"Hello, Benjamin."
00:17:48.568,00:17:53.990,"Now, let me see, minted in 19 and 72."
00:17:55.157,00:17:57.577,That's your buy-in.
00:18:11.173,00:18:12.132,Got the buy-in for the card game.
00:18:12.174,00:18:14.844,"Go get our money, boy."
00:18:14.886,00:18:18.848,"Unfortunately, you and I are gonna have to be partners in this endeavor."
00:18:18.890,00:18:20.058,"Oh, hell, no."
00:18:22.184,00:18:26.522,"Look, all you need to know is this, every time I deal, you bet big and never fold."
00:18:28.190,00:18:32.445,"See, if I'm winning every time I deal, I end up with a Colombian necktie."
00:18:32.486,00:18:38.325,"But if you're the one raking in all the cash, well, I seriously doubt anyone would ever think you and I are working together."
00:18:42.580,00:18:44.373,"It's all right, baby, yeah."
00:18:48.210,00:18:50.254,Excuse me.
00:18:50.296,00:18:51.130,I can't find a charger for this.
00:18:53.674,00:18:54.425,"Well, let me check."
00:19:09.273,00:19:10.942,"How you doing, Savrinn?"
00:19:11.484,00:19:12.526,Where's your girl?
00:19:12.568,00:19:14.278,"She's doing her job, all right?"
00:19:15.446,00:19:17.197,Filing a petition down at the courts.
00:19:17.239,00:19:19.241,She'll be at my place in about an hour.
00:19:28.250,00:19:31.420,"And why don't you remember who you're talking to, who I work for?"
00:19:35.508,00:19:38.719,You need to keep an eye on Veronica Donovan.
00:19:38.761,00:19:41.221,"Not some of the time, all of the time."
00:19:53.275,00:19:54.527,Be in touch.
00:20:03.953,00:20:05.204,Haywire.
00:20:08.499,00:20:12.170,"Haywire, did you take your meds?"
00:20:13.546,00:20:16.549,"Well, come on."
00:20:21.303,00:20:26.767,"You should be careful when you tell people to remember things, Michael."
00:20:27.727,00:20:29.603,Because I remember everything now.
00:20:30.437,00:20:31.271,I remember how you set me up!
00:20:33.315,00:20:39.113,How you smashed your own head and had me sent back here.
00:20:47.621,00:20:49.248,The pathway.
00:20:50.290,00:20:51.250,Your map.
00:20:51.709,00:20:53.627,Your escape.
00:20:53.669,00:20:55.129,Give me that.
00:20:57.965,00:21:07.225,"Now, do I tear this up or do you tell me exactly where and when you're doing this?"
00:21:17.359,00:21:18.485,It starts in the basement.
00:21:19.070,00:21:20.279,Okay.
00:21:21.655,00:21:27.912,"This line leads from the hatch in the coal room, to this pipe system here, and that runs to the infirmary."
00:21:28.662,00:21:30.289,That's how we'll get out.
00:21:31.665,00:21:38.005,"But three days after I'm gone, I'll come back up through the basement and get you out."
00:21:40.466,00:21:44.220,I need you to let me get us out of here.
00:21:45.471,00:21:46.680,I need you to trust me.
00:21:59.359,00:22:02.321,If you try to screw me over again I'll kill you.
00:22:12.414,00:22:14.416,Hi. How did it go?
00:22:14.458,00:22:20.339,"Filing the petition was easy, getting it approved, that's a whole 'nother story."
00:22:22.300,00:22:24.343,You found the charger?
00:22:28.055,00:22:29.389,Why didn't you plug it in?
00:22:29.431,00:22:32.601,"I was just, uh..."
00:22:34.020,00:22:35.229,About what?
00:22:35.271,00:22:35.521,Nothing.
00:22:40.484,00:22:42.402,We're in business.
00:22:42.444,00:22:43.821,What is it?
00:22:43.863,00:22:45.447,"His entire phone book is still in here, 322 numbers."
00:23:20.482,00:23:23.986,No open seats. Gotta wait.
00:23:24.028,00:23:27.990,"C-Note, crap or get off the pot."
00:23:29.491,00:23:32.161,"We ain't betting on CPT here, man."
00:23:32.203,00:23:36.540,Either you gonna see his bet or you can go outside and Million Con March or whatever your people do.
00:23:36.582,00:23:39.085,"Either way, get on with it, son."
00:23:43.505,00:23:44.506,I'm in.
00:23:47.760,00:23:50.428,"Three bitches, bitches."
00:23:51.680,00:23:52.430,What you holding?
00:24:13.535,00:24:14.494,She said what?
00:24:14.536,00:24:18.498,"She said, in unequivocal terms, that I was not to move on Burrows."
00:24:18.540,00:24:22.295,"Whatever their agenda is with Burrows, it is not the same as ours."
00:24:23.296,00:24:27.507,"This whole business with his father, it interferes with the one thing that we set out to do in the first place."
00:24:27.549,00:24:29.635,Put Lincoln Burrows in the ground.
00:24:31.095,00:24:34.432,"If he lives, you're the one that stands to lose, not the Company."
00:24:34.472,00:24:38.394,"They get themselves another candidate, and you're the one that suffers the brunt of it."
00:24:39.437,00:24:41.479,Then maybe it's time we broke ranks.
00:24:43.065,00:24:45.401,"We do that, they pull support for the campaign."
00:24:45.443,00:24:46.526,"You know that, don't you?"
00:24:46.568,00:24:50.656,"That is, if they know, Paul."
00:24:54.076,00:24:56.620,"Mmm, smell that kitty."
00:24:57.663,00:25:00.749,"Jacks or better, Trips to win."
00:25:05.587,00:25:07.631,Last hand.
00:25:08.841,00:25:10.384,I'm tired of losing all my money today.
00:25:11.593,00:25:13.179,How much you up?
00:25:19.268,00:25:20.436,The horseshoe up your ass.
00:25:29.611,00:25:32.239,Misdeal. Bury the card.
00:25:34.574,00:25:36.534,"Yeah, I bet you don't."
00:25:37.495,00:25:39.163,"Bury the card, young blood."
00:25:39.205,00:25:40.538,"Hey, chill, wrinkles."
00:25:41.874,00:25:43.042,Ain't my fault saltine here got a sloppy deal.
00:25:43.083,00:25:45.044,"Oh, that there was just uncalled for."
00:25:45.085,00:25:46.712,"Now, all right."
00:25:46.753,00:25:49.631,"I'm gonna deal another hand, you gonna be such a baby about it."
00:25:52.592,00:25:56.638,"On a misdeal, you bury the card, finish out the hand."
00:25:57.639,00:25:59.099,House rules.
00:26:34.218,00:26:35.344,Warden.
00:26:35.386,00:26:36.594,"I have some good news for you, Linc."
00:26:41.683,00:26:45.271,The Department of Corrections is allowing you a one-hour visit with your son.
00:26:47.731,00:26:49.607,"I've never seen one of these granted before, ever."
00:26:52.152,00:26:52.610,Good lawyers.
00:26:53.695,00:26:55.364,No lawyer's that good.
00:26:56.365,00:26:59.452,"I'll make the travel arrangements, but this is not going to be a ride in the country."
00:27:01.745,00:27:02.788,I don't want any problems.
00:27:02.829,00:27:04.622,"There won't be, I just want to see my son."
00:27:32.734,00:27:37.781,"You better have some aces shoved up there with that horseshoe, or that pot's mine."
00:27:40.742,00:27:42.953,You in or out?
00:28:11.857,00:28:13.066,I'm in.
00:28:15.653,00:28:18.155,And I raise you $74.
00:28:19.781,00:28:21.699,I said I only got $82 left.
00:28:22.826,00:28:23.952,"Well, then I guess you're out of luck."
00:28:23.994,00:28:25.745,You never heard of a gentleman's game?
00:28:25.787,00:28:27.581,"Yes, I have, but this ain't it."
00:28:27.623,00:28:30.708,You want to borrow some money?
00:28:32.002,00:28:34.046,"But I'm in here to make money, bro."
00:28:35.422,00:28:37.715,"You want welfare, you'd better vote Democrat."
00:28:52.856,00:28:56.735,"If you know what's good for you, you'll stay away from me in the yard."
00:29:11.833,00:29:13.669,You think you're smarter than me?
00:29:36.900,00:29:39.819,"No, no, no, no, no, no!"
00:29:41.029,00:29:42.740,"No, there's a pathway!"
00:29:42.781,00:29:44.824,"Look, he's trying to escape!"
00:29:44.866,00:29:46.744,He's trying to escape.
00:29:46.785,00:29:48.120,"Haywire, I need you to come back!"
00:29:48.161,00:29:49.371,He set me up!
00:29:49.413,00:29:50.748,Zap him!
00:29:50.789,00:29:52.249,No! No!
00:30:06.846,00:30:08.348,There he is.
00:30:13.979,00:30:15.355,"Hey, boss."
00:30:15.397,00:30:16.856,"I think you dropped something, man."
00:30:19.234,00:30:21.861,That's half a G-note.
00:30:21.903,00:30:23.863,You don't.
00:30:23.905,00:30:25.907,"Oh, come on, chief, now, we had a deal."
00:30:26.992,00:30:29.161,"Renegotiation, the price is $700 now."
00:30:30.329,00:30:32.872,That ain't right.
00:30:32.914,00:30:35.083,What you gave me was a down payment.
00:30:35.125,00:30:36.960,"If you can't come up with the rest, well..."
00:30:37.002,00:30:39.879,"No, no, no!"
00:30:39.921,00:30:40.839,"One minute, all right?"
00:30:45.594,00:30:47.887,"Oh, man, he's trying to shake us down."
00:30:47.929,00:30:48.972,I'm gonna need that watch.
00:30:49.014,00:30:50.890,Not an option.
00:30:50.932,00:30:57.105,"Look, would you rather be looking at a picture of your daughter or holding her in your arms once you get outside?"
00:31:19.336,00:31:21.921,"Hey, look, man, Father Time owed me a few bones."
00:31:26.968,00:31:28.595,Not bad.
00:31:34.976,00:31:36.269,No! No!
00:31:36.311,00:31:38.355,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Look."
00:31:38.397,00:31:39.981,So you're just gonna take my money and walk?
00:31:40.023,00:31:41.900,"Yeah, well, write to your congressman."
00:31:47.989,00:31:48.741,"Oh, come on!"
00:32:02.003,00:32:02.962,Hey.
00:32:09.720,00:32:10.011,Good.
00:32:12.013,00:32:12.931,Um...
00:32:13.932,00:32:14.933,Please.
00:32:17.102,00:32:18.270,Thanks.
00:32:20.814,00:32:22.148,I made you something.
00:32:29.030,00:32:30.073,It's an ashtray.
00:32:32.033,00:32:36.747,"Yeah, I know."
00:32:40.041,00:32:41.042,It's very sweet.
00:32:41.084,00:32:44.588,"Uh, how about we talk about how you're doing?"
00:32:47.716,00:32:49.968,I think we both know I don't belong here.
00:32:50.009,00:32:55.974,"I don't remember much about that night, but being locked up in ad seg, something must've snapped."
00:32:59.269,00:33:01.980,"What I'm trying to say is, I think I've had enough of arts and crafts."
00:33:06.067,00:33:08.779,And the doctors here do say that you've been acting fine.
00:33:08.821,00:33:13.492,"The problem is that if you don't tell the Pope who burned you, he's gonna lock you back up in ad seg."
00:33:13.533,00:33:15.953,"And after a couple days of that, you're gonna be right back here."
00:33:21.082,00:33:24.503,"Michael, I hate what happened to you, and I hate that you're here."
00:33:25.545,00:33:27.255,But you have got to let me help you.
00:33:29.967,00:33:34.930,"If you want to get out of psych ward, and stay out, you've got to tell the Pope the truth about that burn."
00:33:39.100,00:33:41.394,"Out with the old, in with the new, cons."
00:33:54.157,00:33:57.536,He says he's okay and he's trying to fill in the blanks.
00:33:57.577,00:34:00.706,"Did he say he's trying, or that he already got the blanks filled in?"
00:34:00.747,00:34:03.041,"Yo, man, I don't know."
00:34:03.082,00:34:06.085,Okay. Now you gotta tell him that I filled in the hole.
00:34:06.127,00:34:09.006,"Yeah, yeah, I'm done with your little secrets and messages, bro."
00:34:10.131,00:34:11.884,I saw Scofield's back.
00:34:12.759,00:34:15.094,He's got a burn in the same spot as the burn in that guard's shirt.
00:34:19.474,00:34:22.060,And I'm through helping you until you tell me what's going on.
00:34:23.269,00:34:23.896,"I can't, bro."
00:34:25.146,00:34:26.899,"Then good luck in the hole, jefe."
00:34:30.151,00:34:30.694,Who's that?
00:34:32.153,00:34:33.071,"That's Linc, bro."
00:34:33.906,00:34:35.114,Linc the Sink?
00:34:35.156,00:34:36.575,LINCOLN: Come here.
00:34:51.172,00:34:54.467,"All I can say is, before I get out of here, Geary will pay."
00:34:54.509,00:34:56.428,Believe that.
00:34:56.469,00:35:00.098,No one's getting out of here if maintenance goes to replacing Scofield's toilet.
00:35:04.185,00:35:05.186,"What'd you say, slim?"
00:35:08.189,00:35:10.442,Who the hell said we had a problem?
00:35:10.483,00:35:12.527,"It's cool, man. Relax."
00:35:12.569,00:35:13.653,Lincoln and Sucre told me everything.
00:35:16.197,00:35:18.116,"Exactly, what did they tell you?"
00:35:18.157,00:35:19.618,Everything.
00:35:19.659,00:35:24.748,"They said I can come with you, you know, on early parole, if I can help get the Fish out of psych."
00:35:26.207,00:35:29.669,"What are we, the A train?"
00:35:31.212,00:35:34.091,"Why don't you take a walk, before I give you a smack?"
00:35:42.223,00:35:43.850,I didn't think so.
00:35:46.770,00:35:53.902,Me and my cuz and Lincoln came up with something.
00:36:13.254,00:36:15.507,"You ready to get out of this aquarium, Fish?"
00:37:19.905,00:37:22.281,Assure me I'll be protected.
00:37:23.658,00:37:25.202,"Michael, you know me well enough by now."
00:37:25.243,00:37:27.245,Such assurances are not necessary.
00:37:28.287,00:37:32.876,"With all due respect, Warden, if I had been protected in the first place, none of this would have happened."
00:37:42.427,00:37:44.137,A name.
00:37:44.971,00:37:46.264,Geary.
00:37:47.348,00:37:50.185,Geary?
00:37:52.353,00:37:55.314,"He knew I went to college, so he must've..."
00:37:55.356,00:37:57.358,He must've thought I was rich or something.
00:37:57.400,00:38:05.283,"Anyway, when, uh, when I couldn't pay up, he held me down with one arm, and burned me with the other."
00:38:09.370,00:38:13.083,"I don't know what he used, but it was hot as hell."
00:38:20.339,00:38:22.341,What a surprise.
00:38:22.383,00:38:27.013,"Two-hundred and fifty businesses, 72 residences, covering all 50 states."
00:38:29.348,00:38:31.184,All the numbers out of service.
00:38:31.226,00:38:34.353,"As soon as Quinn disappeared, they must've erased the paper trail within days."
00:38:34.395,00:38:36.273,Is there anything they can't do?
00:38:37.732,00:38:40.652,My P.I. buddy in DC.
00:38:37.732,00:38:43.822,"What if I send him all this, see if he can make a connection between the numbers?"
00:38:43.863,00:38:46.116,I'll tell him I need it ASAP.
00:38:46.158,00:38:49.119,Thank you.
00:38:49.161,00:38:51.121,I'll just overnight him all this stuff.
00:38:55.041,00:38:56.793,"For hanging in there, keeping me going."
00:38:58.419,00:39:00.213,Thank you.
00:39:00.797,00:39:02.299,Sure.

00:39:05.593,00:39:08.847,"Sucks at his job, he still gets a raise."
00:39:08.888,00:39:11.975,You suck at your job.
00:39:12.017,00:39:13.351,Very funny.
00:39:24.029,00:39:26.364,"Hey, what gives?"
00:39:48.594,00:39:50.429,"Hey, that was a gift from my old man."
00:39:50.471,00:39:55.018,Since when is your name Charles and your dad's name Ann?
00:40:30.136,00:40:31.804,This is a railroad.
00:40:33.056,00:40:34.557,Don't look at me like I'm some con.
00:40:34.599,00:40:36.601,You're as crooked as scoliosis.
00:40:39.520,00:40:40.813,I don't get caught.
00:41:15.098,00:41:19.477,"When we get there, I'll take you out of the y-cuffs and put you in a four-piece."
00:41:20.561,00:41:21.980,"Got it, boss."
00:41:22.021,00:41:24.190,"You play nice, I play nice."
00:41:24.607,00:41:25.817,Understand?
00:41:26.276,00:41:27.277,Got it.

00:42:18.995,00:42:22.748,"Uh, Pope wanted me to give you this."
00:42:59.077,00:43:00.078,"What the hell are you staring at, anyway?"
00:43:00.995,00:43:03.581,Everything.
00:00:01.335,00:00:10.344,"SCOFIELD: Previously on Prison Break: Hey, John, you know, actually about Jesus, say hi to him for me, will you?"
00:00:13.096,00:00:15.223,Did you see him?
00:00:15.265,00:00:17.267,The guy in the viewing room.
00:00:17.309,00:00:19.269,It was Dad.
00:00:19.311,00:00:21.104,Where's your girl?
00:00:21.146,00:00:24.274,"Pretty soon, we're gonna call in our favor."
00:00:32.282,00:00:33.784,Have at it.
00:00:36.286,00:00:37.746,Boss!

00:01:59.620,00:02:03.498,"But when she was 12, she got, uh, cancer, so we had to put her down."
00:02:03.540,00:02:11.172,"And you'd think it would be this big, dramatic event, but, it was very peaceful."
00:02:13.174,00:02:15.260,"One minute she was breathing, the next she wasn't."
00:02:25.353,00:02:30.776,MAN: Hey! Everything okay?
00:02:30.818,00:02:32.277,"No, no, I got it."

00:02:39.242,00:02:40.077,You think?
00:02:40.119,00:02:41.912,"All right, if you say so."
00:02:41.954,00:02:43.664,Fine. I think it's going to be fine.
00:03:16.864,00:03:18.197,Cuz!
00:03:20.408,00:03:22.036,You're out.
00:03:22.911,00:03:24.496,"It's good to see you, buddy."
00:03:24.538,00:03:26.581,You all can sign each other's yearbooks later.
00:03:26.623,00:03:30.293,The map is complete.
00:03:32.253,00:03:33.505,Almost.
00:03:33.547,00:03:37.384,I know which pipes we need to take beneath Psych Ward now.
00:03:37.425,00:03:40.261,Which means our way to the Infirmary is clear.
00:03:44.307,00:03:50.022,"Which means we gotta walk down 30 feet of hallway to get to the doctor's office, our exit point."
00:03:55.694,00:03:56.319,The key to that room.
00:04:09.666,00:04:11.043,"How're you fixing on getting it then, pretty?"
00:04:11.085,00:04:11.376,Carefully.
00:04:13.336,00:04:15.380,"No more surprises this time, right?"
00:04:16.506,00:04:17.883,Right.
00:04:19.384,00:04:22.387,"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph."
00:05:29.329,00:05:32.332,"Hello, John."
00:05:35.418,00:05:36.461,How are you?
00:05:40.257,00:05:44.136,Any day above ground is a blessing.
00:05:44.678,00:05:46.387,Thanks be to God.
00:05:48.265,00:05:49.348,Do you mind? Please.
00:05:55.480,00:05:57.274,Lot of rumors goin' around.
00:05:57.316,00:05:58.357,Yeah.
00:06:00.694,00:06:02.361,I'm glad you're back.
00:06:04.572,00:06:07.366,I thought you'd be gone by now.
00:06:08.493,00:06:10.704,"Well, we had a few setbacks."
00:06:12.331,00:06:13.372,Still planning on it?
00:06:14.333,00:06:16.459,That depends.
00:06:18.461,00:06:20.463,How does the idea of escaping sit with the new you?
00:06:22.590,00:06:27.386,"Oh, the old sinner who was confined to these walls, he's dead."
00:06:28.471,00:06:31.808,The new soul deserves to be free.
00:06:33.476,00:06:35.354,"Well, the old sinner was gonna have a jet ready for us."
00:06:39.482,00:06:43.653,"Noah had his Ark, did he not?"
00:06:50.493,00:06:51.995,Let's pray.
00:06:59.294,00:07:01.420,I'm gonna need a blade.
00:07:03.298,00:07:04.423,Pronto.
00:07:05.675,00:07:07.635,Hit and run?
00:07:09.054,00:07:11.390,And Burrows is gone?
00:07:11.806,00:07:12.807,The officers?
00:07:12.849,00:07:15.269,"Two are dead, one is in critical."
00:07:15.310,00:07:17.979,Do you realize what the media's gonna say when they get ahold of this?
00:07:18.021,00:07:19.480,"We'll get him back, sir."
00:07:19.522,00:07:21.191,"40 years in corrections, and this is how they're gonna remember me."
00:07:21.233,00:07:24.861,This is Kane County.
00:07:24.903,00:07:26.446,He hasn't said a word to anyone yet.
00:07:26.487,00:07:29.532,"Give us four, five hours, we'll find him."
00:07:29.574,00:07:32.827,If I don't report this to the D.O.C. right now...
00:07:36.539,00:07:38.458,They don't have to know.
00:07:39.542,00:07:45.048,"You've always been a by-the-book guy, boss, but this time, the book's gonna get us all fired."
00:08:26.840,00:08:32.137,The records of every phone call made to and from every contact in Quinn's cell phone.
00:08:32.179,00:08:34.139,"Well, we have our haystack."
00:08:34.181,00:08:36.350,There must be-- There must be thousands of calls here.
00:08:36.391,00:08:38.310,But to who? To where?
00:08:39.978,00:08:42.439,"You know, it's gonna take us forever to go through all of these."
00:08:42.481,00:08:44.358,"And what if these have nothing to do with Lincoln and Steadman, huh?"
00:08:44.399,00:08:47.361,What if we're just burning time?
00:08:50.405,00:08:52.324,"What's goin' on with you, Nick?"
00:08:52.366,00:08:56.244,"I mean, it's almost like you want to quit."
00:08:56.286,00:08:59.164,I don't want to quit.
00:09:07.047,00:09:09.508,Dr. Tancredi will be right in.
00:09:19.642,00:09:20.435,Morning.
00:09:21.644,00:09:25.023,"How're you, uh, How're you feeling today?"
00:09:25.773,00:09:26.566,Better.
00:09:26.607,00:09:28.568,Good.
00:09:37.618,00:09:43.666,"According to our witness over there, this new perp was driving an '06 Mustang, black, dark blue, maybe."
00:09:43.708,00:09:46.627,"We're not gonna be able to sit on this thing very long, Brad."
00:09:46.669,00:09:49.130,"This is me, Nate."
00:09:49.172,00:09:53.552,All right.
00:09:53.968,00:09:55.554,You mind if I...
00:10:05.146,00:10:07.148,"How're you doin', Mr..."
00:10:09.401,00:10:10.277,Roy Hawkings.
00:10:13.738,00:10:15.449,Where are you goin'?
00:10:15.490,00:10:16.366,"Uh, I'd like to get goin' if I could."
00:10:24.999,00:10:26.293,Kind of an indirect route to get to Aurora.
00:10:26.334,00:10:28.336,I'm not from around here.
00:10:30.464,00:10:34.426,"2006 Mustang, black."
00:10:39.347,00:10:44.436,"If any of you get so much as a whiff of anything, I want to know about it immediately."
00:11:43.161,00:11:44.412,"What do you want from me, Michael?"
00:11:50.544,00:11:52.546,Sara...
00:12:02.972,00:12:05.141,I need you to do something for me.
00:12:16.903,00:12:17.237,Wait for me.
00:12:21.949,00:12:23.951,It won't always be like this.
00:12:25.328,00:12:29.249,"In this room, in this place."
00:12:34.795,00:12:36.339,"Until then, I can't."
00:12:39.133,00:12:39.593,We can't.
00:12:42.845,00:12:44.180,Damn it.
00:12:44.639,00:12:46.641,I can't.
00:12:49.977,00:12:50.520,And I gotta go.
00:13:06.620,00:13:07.203,MAN: Doors closing!
00:13:13.084,00:13:14.210,"Hey, squirt."
00:13:14.877,00:13:15.169,Avocado.
00:13:18.339,00:13:22.093,How many times I gotta say it?
00:13:23.511,00:13:25.388,Mr. Balls-Johnson.
00:13:25.430,00:13:29.100,I think maybe you and I can work something out.
00:13:29.142,00:13:33.104,Really?
00:13:29.142,00:13:36.815,"Check it, I got this homie on the outside and he can put a hundie into your commissary account each month."
00:13:37.984,00:13:42.489,"It was nice of you to think of me like that, but you only got one thing I need."
00:14:06.220,00:14:08.473,I need you to get something for me.
00:14:12.893,00:14:14.312,Exactly.
00:14:14.354,00:14:18.191,"Yeah, that did me a lot of good."
00:14:20.067,00:14:23.863,Guards found out and they stuck me into a cell with Avocado.
00:14:38.085,00:14:40.213,Kill that son of a bitch.
00:14:43.132,00:14:45.844,That's not something I can do.
00:14:50.973,00:14:53.100,What was that?
00:14:53.976,00:14:59.190,"This kid in my neighborhood, his dad had a baseball card collection."
00:15:02.485,00:15:05.196,"So I figured, you know, I'd swipe it."
00:15:10.993,00:15:13.079,And there was one card in there.
00:15:15.206,00:15:17.500,A 1910 Honus Wagner.
00:15:20.002,00:15:23.798,"Doesn't mean nothin' to me, you know. Hoops is my sport."
00:15:26.092,00:15:28.261,"This card, it was worth $300,000."
00:15:31.097,00:15:33.974,So they slapped me with grand larceny.
00:15:38.020,00:15:39.564,That's why I'm here.
00:15:42.066,00:15:46.153,That's why I'm sitting on a nickel getting turned out like a little bitch.
00:16:31.073,00:16:32.366,Dad?
00:16:41.083,00:16:43.085,What are you doing here?
00:16:48.800,00:16:50.802,I mean what are you doing here?
00:16:52.178,00:16:54.096,I've got a car about 20 miles from here.
00:16:54.138,00:16:57.016,We'll switch out.
00:16:54.138,00:17:00.060,"After that, gonna make sure you disappear."
00:17:02.480,00:17:05.232,Then this business will just be between me and them.
00:17:06.317,00:17:07.861,Can you move?
00:17:07.902,00:17:09.487,What are you talkin' about?
00:17:11.113,00:17:12.490,"It's not as simple as that, trust me."
00:17:15.743,00:17:16.870,I worked for them.
00:17:16.911,00:17:19.079,You worked for them?
00:17:19.121,00:17:23.877,Is that what you remember or is that what you were told?
00:17:29.799,00:17:32.092,I took a position with a group of multinationals we call The Company.
00:17:33.260,00:17:41.394,"They call every shot this country takes, what laws to pass, what judges to appoint, what wars to fight."
00:17:47.149,00:17:50.110,Because then you start to get access to the real information.
00:17:56.242,00:17:58.912,You expect me to believe that?
00:18:00.162,00:18:01.247,Why didn't you reach out to us?
00:18:14.176,00:18:16.178,That's why they're doing this to you.
00:18:16.220,00:18:19.306,"All of it, to stop me."
00:18:21.434,00:18:23.937,You have to trust me.
00:18:23.978,00:18:25.354,NIKA: Then you'll have to tell me what's going on.
00:18:26.480,00:18:28.482,SCOFIELD: I can't do that.
00:18:33.988,00:18:35.531,"Look, I did what you ask."
00:18:36.449,00:18:38.534,"Then, we'll make a new deal."
00:18:39.911,00:18:41.245,"Michael, if somebody find out..."
00:18:41.287,00:18:47.293,"I know, and this is why I won't help you."
00:18:47.334,00:18:50.212,"Look, Nika, I promise you..."
00:18:50.254,00:18:51.297,"Look, I don't know what's going on."
00:18:51.338,00:19:02.349,"I don't know why you're in there, but if there's one thing those guys that brought me here taught me, is that if you fight, if you struggle, you only make things worse."
00:19:03.434,00:19:05.269,"Stop fighting, Michael."
00:19:07.772,00:19:08.397,"Just think about it, okay?"
00:19:08.439,00:19:10.900,I'm sorry.
00:19:22.120,00:19:25.331,"There it is again, the 406 number."
00:19:25.748,00:19:27.333,406.
00:19:29.085,00:19:34.590,"Yeah, there's--there's over 200 businesses, another 100 residences in 17 different countries."
00:19:34.632,00:19:36.300,And they're all callin' the same number.
00:19:36.342,00:19:37.468,Montana.
00:19:41.263,00:19:43.223,This doesn't make sense.
00:19:48.270,00:19:49.689,"Blackfoot, Montana."
00:20:06.956,00:20:09.416,"I thought you understood, Terrence."
00:20:09.458,00:20:13.253,"If you wanna talk, we set up a meeting, at home, in person."
00:20:13.295,00:20:16.507,I saw the latest trackin'.
00:20:23.263,00:20:25.391,"Goodbye, Terrence."
00:20:25.432,00:20:27.185,It is.
00:20:27.226,00:20:31.814,Are we talkin' about Lincoln Burrows or your candidacy?
00:20:31.856,00:20:38.445,The only reason that you are still alive is because I won't let them kill you.
00:20:39.321,00:20:40.239,Yeah.
00:20:42.075,00:20:45.494,I'm pretty clear on that.
00:20:42.075,00:20:52.251,"But the thing I can't quite figure is, with the crap storm this thing's become, why they haven't killed you."
00:21:38.380,00:21:40.591,Figure out how you're gonna get the key to the Infirmary yet?
00:21:43.136,00:21:43.469,Not quite.
00:21:44.845,00:21:46.639,"You working a game on her, or what?"
00:21:55.439,00:21:57.900,MAN: Hey man!
00:22:00.444,00:22:02.780,I've had time to think.
00:22:04.657,00:22:09.996,"Not that you tried to kill me, but about how Jesus saved me."
00:22:14.416,00:22:18.129,"I didn't come here, Theodore, to inflict any more pain."
00:22:20.422,00:22:26.220,Take my hand so we can put this behind us.
00:22:34.270,00:22:36.689,Show me the palm of your other hand.
00:22:38.691,00:22:43.070,Don't insult me.
00:22:38.691,00:22:48.575,"After all that you've done, the least I ask is that you don't insult me."
00:23:11.389,00:23:17.395,Does not a warm hand feel better than a cold shank?
00:23:28.448,00:23:29.700,Truce?
00:23:30.492,00:23:32.286,You got it. Truce.
00:23:48.219,00:23:54.183,Son of a bitch. It's been two and a half hours and you're tellin' me that sheriff has got nothing?
00:23:54.225,00:23:56.018,I'm tellin' you the roads are blocked off.
00:23:56.060,00:23:59.146,That Mustang's got to be somewhere within those 10 square miles.
00:23:59.188,00:24:03.025,"All right, listen, you got two hours to find him."
00:24:03.067,00:24:04.484,"After that, I have got to talk to the press."
00:24:04.526,00:24:10.448,"Hey, but there's an escaped killer outside our walls and there are some things that are more important than career."
00:24:10.490,00:24:12.076,Now you find him!
00:24:15.204,00:24:16.205,"STOLTE: Hey, Captain."
00:24:17.497,00:24:19.208,I don't have time.
00:24:20.084,00:24:21.501,He says he really needs to talk.
00:24:21.543,00:24:23.379,You have somethin' for me or do you need somethin'?
00:24:23.421,00:24:26.340,"'Cause if it's the latter, you just wasted my time."
00:24:26.382,00:24:28.801,"That cellie you stuck me with, Avocado..."
00:24:28.842,00:24:32.263,Do you have somethin' or do you need somethin'?
00:24:32.305,00:24:36.016,"I'm askin' you to just, please, get me out of that cell."
00:24:37.435,00:24:39.145,"Boss, please. Boss!"
00:24:40.478,00:24:42.398,Let's go.
00:24:54.076,00:24:57.537,You need to start relaxin'.
00:24:57.579,00:25:00.540,Can we go on your bunk?
00:25:00.582,00:25:01.375,"Sure, squirt."
00:25:03.252,00:25:06.839,Let me make it a wee bit more comfortable.
00:25:15.097,00:25:17.515,Now we're talkin'.
00:25:31.364,00:25:33.449,Are you the doctor from the prison?
00:25:38.620,00:25:39.830,I do.
00:25:42.624,00:25:45.085,"You're his wife, right?"
00:25:46.420,00:25:47.963,I think Michael has got himself in some trouble.
00:25:48.005,00:25:51.842,And I think he's planning on doing something dangerous to get out of it.
00:26:00.393,00:26:02.311,Thanks.
00:26:02.353,00:26:06.648,So what is it that you...
00:26:06.690,00:26:08.150,So I've come to understand.
00:26:08.192,00:26:10.403,That's actually how we met.
00:26:11.987,00:26:14.198,There were these men that brought me here.
00:26:14.240,00:26:19.370,"Told me I'd have good job, but that was just a lie."
00:26:22.748,00:26:25.084,"And until they did, I..."
00:26:26.668,00:26:29.255,Michael paid them off for my freedom.
00:26:30.214,00:26:35.593,"And not to keep me for himself, like I've heard from other girls, but to give me an opportunity."
00:26:38.764,00:26:40.433,He's a good man.
00:26:41.183,00:26:42.600,"Yes, he is."
00:26:44.228,00:26:47.189,"Nika, I wanna do whatever I can to help Michael."
00:26:47.231,00:26:51.609,"To do that, I need you to tell me what it is you think he's mixed up in."
00:26:54.947,00:26:56.323,"No, no, it's not at all."
00:26:56.365,00:26:59.118,"Please, just keep an eye on him."
00:26:59.159,00:27:02.662,"God, I'm sorry. Thanks."
00:27:02.704,00:27:06.666,"Listen, could I just have a contact number for you in case I see something wrong."
00:27:06.708,00:27:08.919,Please don't tell him that we met.
00:27:17.177,00:27:21.557,Something I don't get.
00:27:23.976,00:27:27.354,'Cause I'm the one who leaked the information about Ecofield.
00:27:27.396,00:27:33.527,"They could've covered up the scandal a thousand different ways, but they chose to fake Terrence Steadman's death."
00:27:34.945,00:27:38.574,And they chose you 'cause they knew it would flush me out.
00:27:40.117,00:27:45.247,They knew that any man with a son on death row who was innocent would have to come forward.
00:27:46.832,00:27:48.250,But you didn't.
00:27:50.752,00:27:51.170,"We had a cause, Linc."
00:27:53.547,00:27:54.173,We have a cause.
00:27:56.592,00:28:02.598,Their wars can be averted and millions of lives can be saved.
00:28:07.311,00:28:08.562,Yeah.
00:28:11.106,00:28:12.816,At least I thought.
00:28:19.657,00:28:21.534,You know what you've done?
00:28:25.787,00:28:26.830,I know.
00:28:28.999,00:28:34.880,Then I'm guessing you know Michael's in Fox River and LJ's rotting in some jail.
00:28:34.921,00:28:35.755,If you think for a second...
00:28:35.797,00:28:37.591,You don't have a choice right now.
00:28:38.509,00:28:41.720,This is all on you.
00:28:43.805,00:28:47.351,"Yeah, I know."
00:28:48.810,00:28:50.729,'Cause there's still a chance we can make it right.
00:29:22.802,00:29:32.812,"That man in there is our transportation out of here, which means that, you go after him, and that messes with my chances of me seein' my family."
00:29:32.854,00:29:34.898,So I ain't gonna let that happen.
00:29:36.858,00:29:39.986,"So why don't you just hand me that shank you're holdin', huh?"
00:29:45.492,00:29:46.702,Good.
00:30:02.593,00:30:04.928,"RICK: Hey, Sara."
00:30:05.596,00:30:07.514,You all right?
00:30:08.890,00:30:09.349,Yeah. I can't find my keys.
00:30:09.391,00:30:11.769,"Oh, sure."
00:30:17.524,00:30:19.859,I'm surprised to see you here.
00:30:20.736,00:30:22.321,That makes both of us.
00:30:23.739,00:30:24.823,Look.
00:30:27.743,00:30:29.411,You were right and I'm sorry.
00:30:32.914,00:30:34.166,"Oh, it's okay."
00:30:34.207,00:30:36.502,If anyone knew what I asked...
00:30:41.757,00:30:43.842,I'm not even sure why I did it.
00:30:45.803,00:30:47.095,Thank you.
00:30:47.929,00:30:48.347,Now we're even.
00:30:49.389,00:30:51.725,You didn't owe me anything.
00:30:51.767,00:30:53.059,"Yes, I did."
00:30:54.311,00:30:57.189,"I owed you everything, but that's over now."
00:30:59.941,00:31:00.400,Goodbye.
00:31:04.946,00:31:07.574,"The lady doctor, she cares for you."
00:31:20.170,00:31:22.339,Bellick. It's the sheriff.
00:31:22.381,00:31:24.466,"Go, for Bellick."
00:31:24.508,00:31:27.469,We just got a call from Steve Schimek up at the junkyard.
00:31:27.511,00:31:30.222,Our Mustang is on the premises.
00:31:30.263,00:31:33.350,"NATE: Yep, I got a couple of units five, 10 minutes away, tops."
00:31:33.392,00:31:34.393,"Good, I'm right behind you."
00:31:38.605,00:31:40.816,Here. You ready to travel?
00:31:45.987,00:31:47.406,There's a chance they haven't blocked it off yet.
00:31:50.492,00:31:52.911,We got trouble.
00:31:55.581,00:31:57.916,Come on. Through here.
00:33:12.491,00:33:13.867,Come on.
00:33:13.909,00:33:14.952,Hey!
00:33:24.670,00:33:27.380,Get out of here. Go.
00:33:29.299,00:33:30.801,Turn around.
00:33:43.104,00:33:47.025,"Bellick, don't shoot!"
00:33:56.117,00:33:58.662,MAN 1: All right on your knees!
00:33:58.704,00:33:59.705,MAN 2: Right there! Right there!
00:34:01.373,00:34:03.082,Take him down!
00:34:09.589,00:34:11.675,"You thought you'd go for a little stroll, did you?"
00:34:34.239,00:34:36.324,Got his salchicha sliced.
00:34:37.534,00:34:39.953,How?
00:34:39.995,00:34:44.583,"But Avocado's sayin' it got caught on the frame while he was hopping down off his bunk, yeah."
00:34:44.624,00:34:45.834,Why did he lie?
00:34:45.876,00:34:49.546,He doesn't want Tweener to go to the SHU 'cause he can't get him in there.
00:34:51.297,00:34:56.219,"All I have to say is, as soon as Avocado gets out of the infirmary, Tweener is a dead man."
00:34:56.261,00:34:59.097,How's that key coming?
00:35:00.891,00:35:03.476,What about your car?
00:35:05.144,00:35:06.354,Your apartment?
00:35:07.564,00:35:09.357,"Uh, no, 'cause I had them this morning."
00:35:14.195,00:35:16.531,Just retrace your steps.
00:35:16.573,00:35:18.366,"Uh, when I came back from lunch..."
00:35:38.845,00:35:41.514,"Hey, Kev, I need to take a look at that visitation log."
00:35:56.029,00:35:57.114,Thanks.
00:35:59.240,00:36:00.951,ABRUZZI: Michael?
00:36:01.743,00:36:03.495,I need to know where he is.
00:36:06.039,00:36:09.001,Who?
00:36:09.042,00:36:16.299,"You see, my conversion requires that I not only seek forgiveness, but provide forgiveness, even to my greatest transgressors."
00:36:18.259,00:36:23.515,"Don't look at me like that, like I'm the same old man I used to be. I'm not."
00:36:25.266,00:36:30.480,"Trust me, I need to reach out to Fibonacci, so we can heal."
00:36:37.278,00:36:39.156,I understand.
00:36:41.033,00:36:42.868,I'll be patient.
00:37:00.301,00:37:03.930,NICK: Hello.
00:37:05.264,00:37:08.060,And you'll have her there.
00:37:08.685,00:37:10.854,Yeah. I'll do my best.
00:37:10.896,00:37:13.148,"Hey, I said, do you understand?"
00:37:19.278,00:37:20.363,Good.
00:37:20.405,00:37:23.241,Goose Park airstrip.
00:37:23.282,00:37:29.081,"As soon as I call, you have that bitch there ready and waiting."
00:37:39.091,00:37:39.257,Hey.
00:37:42.844,00:37:45.471,You still want me to swipe the thing you were askin' about?
00:37:46.890,00:37:48.307,'Cause I'm havin' a going-out-of-business sale.
00:37:48.349,00:37:52.104,Why don't you get yourself to Ad Seg?
00:38:00.403,00:38:02.530,I'm dead no matter what.
00:38:08.995,00:38:10.413,"Yeah, in a body bag."
00:38:21.382,00:38:24.886,"I'm as straight up as they come, you know?"
00:38:24.928,00:38:27.097,"No, I mean really trust you."
00:38:35.396,00:38:36.982,Hey.
00:38:37.023,00:38:37.232,Hi.
00:38:42.779,00:38:44.114,How are you?
00:38:44.572,00:38:46.407,I'm fine. You?
00:38:48.576,00:38:49.911,Fine.
00:38:52.413,00:38:52.998,"Can I have your hand, please?"
00:39:05.593,00:39:07.179,Here what are?
00:39:07.220,00:39:10.682,"Your keys, they were right over there by your inbox."
00:39:12.309,00:39:17.647,"Well, you got a maintenance guy waitin' outside here, says you wanted him to change the locks."
00:39:21.776,00:39:24.362,"No, send him in."
00:39:28.867,00:39:31.494,Is it okay if I...
00:39:33.663,00:39:35.790,Yeah. We're about done here.
00:39:43.923,00:39:45.925,Is there something wrong?
00:39:47.468,00:39:48.594,No.
00:39:52.557,00:39:54.851,Unless you want to talk about what happened this morning.
00:39:54.893,00:39:59.064,I think I have a pretty good idea.
00:40:37.102,00:40:39.229,I want him under 24-hour surveillance.
00:40:40.438,00:40:43.400,He doesn't sneeze without my knowing it.
00:40:43.441,00:40:45.651,What the hell for?
00:40:47.028,00:40:49.030,Someone tried to kill me.
00:40:50.949,00:40:53.618,Finding you in a junkyard eight miles from here makes me think different.
00:40:54.493,00:40:55.870,Who was your accomplice?
00:40:57.163,00:40:59.207,What accomplice?
00:40:59.249,00:41:01.542,24-hour surveillance.
00:41:35.201,00:41:37.203,Boss.
00:41:41.207,00:41:44.419,Must have been some serious gymnastics goin' on.
00:41:50.675,00:41:55.554,Anything else?
00:41:55.596,00:41:57.098,"Believe me, what I got is worth it."
00:41:58.057,00:42:01.727,"So, are you gonna step up or what?"
00:42:04.605,00:42:06.607,"This is your last chance, Tweener."
00:42:06.649,00:42:10.028,"You blow smoke again, they'll be scraping you off the heel of my boot."
00:42:10.069,00:42:16.493,"Scofield and his whole PI crew, they're escaping."
00:00:01.376,00:00:06.256,SCOFIELD: Previously on Prison Break: I want him under 24-hour surveillance.
00:00:10.260,00:00:12.137,REYNOLDS: Terrence.
00:00:12.179,00:00:18.853,The thing I can't quite figure is with the crap storm this thing's become why they haven't killed you.
00:00:18.894,00:00:20.020,Have at it.
00:00:25.359,00:00:29.112,"Now, out of respect for what you once were, I'm going to let you walk away."
00:00:39.289,00:00:42.376,Why don't you just hand me that shank you're holding?
00:00:46.714,00:00:48.256,I'm not even sure why you need it.
00:00:50.133,00:00:52.678,"Your keys, they were right over there by your in-box."
00:01:00.143,00:01:01.729,"No, send him in."
00:01:01.770,00:01:03.188,"It's your last chance, Tweener."
00:01:03.230,00:01:10.237,"Scofield and his whole PI crew, they're escaping."
00:01:27.337,00:01:30.716,"You know I can't let you leave here, boss."
00:02:22.309,00:02:29.232,"Dogs. The numerous times I've been apprehended while trying to elude the authorities, it's always because of the damn dogs."
00:02:42.245,00:02:50.420,"Kinte, you can smell like a bouquet of bonbons, but unless you get rid of your smell, you might as well send a note to the police with directions and some cab fare."
00:02:50.462,00:02:53.381,"You know, Theodore's right, man."
00:02:55.342,00:02:57.678,What about our bunks?
00:02:57.719,00:03:00.139,Either get rid of your smell or change it.
00:03:05.853,00:03:07.437,"Well, how much time we got?"
00:03:07.479,00:03:09.272,SCOFIELD: John?
00:03:09.314,00:03:12.400,That's the soonest I could get us into the guards' room for PI.
00:03:13.694,00:03:15.445,You think you'll have the extra suits by then?
00:03:15.487,00:03:17.489,Probably.
00:03:18.281,00:03:19.282,"Good, so we're good to go."
00:03:23.286,00:03:24.245,How to get Linc out of that box.
00:03:26.289,00:03:27.582,Three days should be plenty of time.
00:03:30.418,00:03:32.420,We got to get out of here.
00:04:09.875,00:04:11.292,I don't know how he found it.
00:04:13.420,00:04:19.051,"I covered it the best I could, but it's just a matter of time before someone discovers Bellick's missing."
00:04:33.356,00:04:35.442,Maybe they won't notice for a while.
00:04:35.483,00:04:38.361,Nothing happens around here without Bellick's say so.
00:04:44.201,00:04:45.077,What are we gonna do?
00:04:45.119,00:04:48.413,"As soon as it gets dark, we go."
00:04:50.665,00:04:52.042,Escape already started.
00:04:52.084,00:04:53.627,It started the minute Bellick found that hole.
00:04:53.668,00:04:55.336,And it's gonna end the minute they figure out that he's missing.
00:04:55.378,00:04:57.422,Then stay!
00:04:58.882,00:05:01.051,I'll be sure to read the papers in the morning.
00:05:08.391,00:05:10.644,"So what's the play, man?"
00:05:12.229,00:05:14.355,Do you think you can have the plane ready by tonight?
00:05:14.397,00:05:15.690,Sure.
00:05:15.732,00:05:17.943,"You had kitchen duty, right?"
00:05:19.486,00:05:21.155,I don't know.
00:05:19.486,00:05:22.363,"I think it was some peroxide, or something like that."
00:05:22.405,00:05:23.531,Get as much as you can.
00:05:23.573,00:05:26.743,I'll work on getting us that key to the infirmary.
00:05:26.785,00:05:29.579,The rest of you find whatever you can to get rid of the scent in your cells.
00:05:29.621,00:05:31.748,None of this matters if we can't get in the guards' room.
00:05:31.790,00:05:34.417,"We're gonna leave after dinner, during tier time when the gates are open."
00:05:34.459,00:05:36.377,"7:00, one by one, through my cell."
00:05:36.419,00:05:39.380,"Whoa, whoa."
00:05:39.422,00:05:43.051,"That was going to give us a head start, hours before they even found out we were missing."
00:05:43.093,00:05:44.261,"We leave through your cell, we ain't got no lead time."
00:05:44.303,00:05:47.055,"7:00. Count's at 8:00, that's only..."
00:05:47.097,00:05:49.057,Sixty minutes.
00:05:49.099,00:05:51.643,Sixty minutes to get over that wall and as far away from here as possible.
00:05:51.685,00:05:54.021,They'll be right on our asses.
00:05:54.062,00:05:57.356,PATTERSON: Quit your talking and start your walking.
00:05:57.899,00:05:59.358,They already are.
00:06:11.454,00:06:14.373,"You know, there's one thing we didn't talk about out there."
00:06:14.415,00:06:15.667,Your brother.
00:06:15.709,00:06:17.418,"I mean, he's under 24-hour surveillance."
00:06:17.460,00:06:23.382,"I'm just saying, if you can't get to him by tonight, we still have to go, you know that, right?"
00:06:33.392,00:06:34.644,GUARD: Lock it down.
00:06:51.203,00:06:52.037,What do you want?
00:06:52.079,00:06:53.621,My brother's in Gen Pop.
00:06:56.583,00:06:58.043,So?
00:07:14.768,00:07:17.396,And you're sure all those dots connect?
00:07:17.437,00:07:18.479,Okay. Thank you.
00:07:19.940,00:07:22.025,Who was that?
00:07:19.940,00:07:23.777,"A friend of mine at the title company, handled a lot of my firm's business."
00:07:23.818,00:07:26.405,She dug up an address for that phone number in Blackfoot.
00:07:26.446,00:07:28.156,Where is it?
00:07:28.198,00:07:29.366,"It's not the where that's interesting, it's the how."
00:07:29.408,00:07:35.247,It turns out our little place in Montana was purchased for $2 million by an offshore holding corporation.
00:07:35.289,00:07:38.166,"Well, that's pretty standard for a transaction that size, though, right?"
00:07:38.208,00:07:42.421,Sure.
00:07:46.633,00:07:48.385,"Looks like you and I are going to Blackfoot, Montana."
00:08:10.573,00:08:12.326,Have you seen Bellick today?
00:08:12.367,00:08:14.953,Why?
00:08:14.995,00:08:16.330,I guess he ain't showed up yet.
00:08:16.371,00:08:18.498,He's probably just late.
00:08:23.586,00:08:25.505,"Scofield, this ain't Gibsons."
00:08:28.216,00:08:29.759,"They're already starting to ask questions, man."
00:08:34.597,00:08:36.183,How we coming with that peroxide?
00:08:36.224,00:08:38.601,I'm gonna need it before we meet up for yard duty.
00:08:38.643,00:08:40.895,Probably not till later.
00:08:40.937,00:08:42.605,You wanna tell me what you need it for?
00:08:54.409,00:08:55.410,No.
00:08:55.452,00:08:57.912,You mind if I...
00:08:57.954,00:08:59.331,They smell like crap.
00:09:18.641,00:09:20.352,"Yo, if you got..."
00:09:21.269,00:09:23.563,What?
00:09:25.815,00:09:28.735,"Why, did something happen?"
00:09:28.776,00:09:30.737,He'll tell you what you need to do to be ready.
00:09:30.778,00:09:32.572,But what about the...
00:09:40.830,00:09:42.499,MAN 1: What the hell's going on?
00:09:42.541,00:09:44.625,The President changed his mind.
00:09:44.667,00:09:47.087,We were given assurances he would veto the energy bill.
00:09:54.135,00:09:55.762,Then change it back.
00:09:57.680,00:10:00.350,The President...
00:10:03.937,00:10:06.356,We certainly wouldn't want you to take it for granted.
00:10:07.690,00:10:09.692,Why? Do you feel threatened?
00:10:09.734,00:10:17.325,"MAN 2: Caroline, we've all been through this before, the ebbs and flows of political conscience, but we've found at the end of the day we get what we want."
00:10:18.952,00:10:27.252,"If you can't convince a doddering old fool finishing up his second term what the best thing is for this country's economy, perhaps you're not the kind of helper we're looking for."
00:10:46.438,00:10:47.730,Sara.
00:10:47.772,00:10:49.774,I was thinking about something...
00:10:49.816,00:10:53.153,"Enough with the--the lies and the coincidences and the stories, all of it."
00:10:53.194,00:10:55.322,It's not what you think.
00:10:55.363,00:10:57.449,"The question is, are you man enough to admit it?"
00:10:59.117,00:11:00.410,The keys.
00:11:02.745,00:11:06.291,Congratulations.
00:11:06.333,00:11:07.334,It's not...
00:11:08.209,00:11:09.294,"What are you after, Michael?"
00:11:12.797,00:11:13.923,Neither.
00:11:13.965,00:11:15.467,Then what?
00:11:18.761,00:11:21.473,Please understand that I never meant...
00:11:23.016,00:11:25.893,I never wanted to involve you in this.
00:11:25.935,00:11:27.187,"Well, you've done a pretty poor job of that."
00:11:27.228,00:11:29.814,I came here to tell you something.
00:11:38.365,00:11:39.698,And I need your help.
00:11:55.965,00:11:58.176,"Michael, uh, honestly, for your own good, don't say anything more."
00:11:58.218,00:12:00.136,You know he's innocent.
00:12:00.178,00:12:02.096,Do what you're talking about and he won't be.
00:12:02.138,00:12:06.267,You understand that I'm required to report everything you're telling me.
00:12:06.309,00:12:07.852,Yes.
00:12:07.894,00:12:09.479,Because you're the only one that can help.
00:12:13.816,00:12:16.319,Neither is doing nothing knowing what you know about his case.
00:12:16.361,00:12:17.778,How dare you put this on me.
00:12:17.820,00:12:20.156,I did what I could.
00:12:20.198,00:12:26.705,"No offense to your father, but the people who are framing Lincoln, let's just say they have a higher security clearance."
00:12:26.745,00:12:28.915,So now it's a conspiracy?
00:12:28.956,00:12:29.832,You're asking me to break the law.
00:12:29.874,00:12:31.084,I'm asking you to make a mistake.
00:12:31.125,00:12:34.795,"Not hurt anyone, not steal anything."
00:12:39.300,00:12:42.387,Leave the door unlocked when you leave tonight.
00:12:47.183,00:12:50.228,This is where you're breaking out of?
00:12:52.355,00:12:56.317,There are alarm contacts on the glass surrounding the door.
00:12:56.359,00:12:58.111,"Otherwise, I wouldn't need you to..."
00:12:58.152,00:13:00.530,I was part of your plan.
00:13:03.157,00:13:04.325,Was it all an act?
00:13:08.871,00:13:10.789,I needed to be here.
00:13:11.958,00:13:14.127,But then I wanted to be here with you.
00:13:14.168,00:13:16.087,Right.
00:13:20.174,00:13:23.219,"Whatever you may think of me, this is about Lincoln."
00:13:26.139,00:13:27.223,Don't make him pay for my mistakes.
00:13:43.906,00:13:45.908,MAN: Yeah?
00:13:45.950,00:13:47.160,"Hi, it's me."
00:13:47.201,00:13:49.203,There's been an acceleration.
00:13:50.121,00:13:51.122,How fast are we talking about?
00:13:51.164,00:13:52.499,Fast. Tonight.
00:13:52.540,00:13:54.167,Son of a bitch.
00:13:57.211,00:13:58.254,"Yeah, of course."
00:13:58.296,00:14:01.090,Good.
00:14:01.132,00:14:02.258,The van?
00:14:02.300,00:14:04.511,Behind the old mill?
00:14:04.552,00:14:06.220,"Behind the old mill, I got it."
00:14:08.931,00:14:10.141,"One question, John."
00:14:13.936,00:14:16.105,I thought you said there were seven or eight guys.
00:14:16.147,00:14:18.775,"Well, not everybody gonna have a ticket."
00:14:21.277,00:14:23.196,The three of us still breathing.
00:14:24.405,00:14:27.074,Whatever airport's closer to Blackfoot.
00:14:27.116,00:14:31.245,"Aisle, window, it--it doesn't matter, just get us on the next flight."
00:14:33.080,00:14:35.792,"Yeah, I'll hold."
00:14:38.294,00:14:40.380,Hello?
00:14:40.421,00:14:43.883,We're going to need you to have a girl at the airstrip tonight.
00:14:44.133,00:14:45.009,Tonight?
00:14:45.051,00:14:46.969,Was I not enunciating?
00:14:47.887,00:14:49.138,"No, it-it's just that..."
00:14:50.598,00:14:52.141,"Look, things could get messy."
00:15:17.166,00:15:19.919,Is that his nympho secretary?
00:15:19.960,00:15:21.546,"Come on, man, like you wouldn't hit that."
00:15:21.588,00:15:25.132,"I don't know, Vegas, 2:00 a.m., maybe, but if she didn't have such a big booty."
00:15:26.509,00:15:28.511,"Man, the booty is the man's biggest weakness."
00:15:28.553,00:15:30.137,I know I would've hit it.
00:15:45.152,00:15:46.780,I'm working on it.
00:16:16.142,00:16:19.479,"Yo, you seen Bellick today?"
00:16:20.062,00:16:22.941,I need to talk to him.
00:16:22.982,00:16:24.692,Do I look like his mother?
00:16:24.734,00:16:25.109,The guy hasn't shown up yet.
00:16:28.571,00:16:30.030,You sure he ain't showed yet?
00:16:30.072,00:16:31.031,"'Cause I thought I saw him here this morning, man."
00:16:31.073,00:16:34.034,Tweener!
00:16:34.076,00:16:36.120,"Yeah, I'm on it."
00:16:45.713,00:16:46.088,"It's just, uh, just sore, that's all."
00:16:48.299,00:16:51.177,"You live to my age, you'll know all about it."
00:17:14.158,00:17:18.329,"You know you got a couple of foxes in your hen house, right?"
00:17:18.371,00:17:19.497,Who are we talking about?
00:17:19.539,00:17:21.749,The bastard and the born again.
00:17:21.791,00:17:23.250,They both want out of here.
00:17:23.292,00:17:25.169,Think so?
00:17:29.131,00:17:33.887,"If I would've been there 10 seconds later, they'd have been serving Abruzzi with red sauce over at the morgue."
00:17:41.853,00:17:43.103,Yeah.
00:17:43.145,00:17:47.066,Ain't no do-overs this time.
00:17:47.107,00:17:49.861,"We break out tonight, or we ain't never getting out."
00:18:00.872,00:18:03.290,We got that paperwork in from the county.
00:18:04.625,00:18:05.334,Sara?
00:18:06.920,00:18:07.211,Yeah. Sorry.
00:18:10.172,00:18:12.383,The paperwork from the county.
00:18:15.177,00:18:17.096,I got to get out of here.
00:18:18.180,00:18:19.974,Where--where are you going?
00:18:38.158,00:18:39.827,Put your blues on over your PI gear.
00:18:39.869,00:18:41.203,SUCRE: What?
00:18:43.289,00:18:44.791,You want to tell us why?
00:18:44.832,00:18:47.376,"If we don't have time to get the suits we need, we're gonna have to make them."
00:18:47.418,00:18:50.129,"Yo, what the hell are you doing, man?"
00:18:50.170,00:18:52.632,It's okay.
00:18:54.341,00:18:57.887,"Hey, whatever happened to, We got too many people?"
00:18:59.221,00:19:01.181,I'll make sure we all get through.
00:19:01.223,00:19:05.436,"T-BAG: Well, for health reasons, information like that should be disseminated a little more pronto."
00:19:08.272,00:19:10.357,He is not coming.
00:19:10.399,00:19:12.192,It's not up for discussion.
00:19:12.234,00:19:14.112,I owe him.
00:19:14.946,00:19:16.280,I don't owe you a damn thing.
00:19:18.240,00:19:22.411,"Well, you're gonna if we get nailed 'cause you didn't wanna cut down on the damn guest list."
00:19:27.750,00:19:29.209,"Don't worry, it'll be fine."
00:19:40.304,00:19:42.348,"Hey! Hold up, cons."
00:19:48.270,00:19:51.357,I saw some drops of blood on the floor of the PI locker room.
00:19:51.398,00:19:53.609,Now who's going to tell me what's going on?
00:20:11.335,00:20:15.255,"I, uh, did it while I was loading some equipment back into the shed."
00:20:17.299,00:20:19.218,You make sure and get that patched up.
00:20:20.302,00:20:21.428,Will do.
00:20:22.805,00:20:24.057,Okay.
00:20:24.306,00:20:26.475,Move it!
00:20:32.356,00:20:34.274,Are you okay?
00:20:34.316,00:20:39.030,"Okay enough to make it out of here tonight, I swear."
00:21:10.352,00:21:11.687,"Hey, Shelly, this is..."
00:21:11.729,00:21:15.482,"Listen, I know I'm supposed to call you as my sponsor, in case I have a..."
00:21:20.487,00:21:21.488,Um...
00:22:04.198,00:22:05.199,Whoa!
00:22:06.325,00:22:08.327,Right.
00:22:09.996,00:22:11.497,I think we should break a bottle of champagne across its bow.
00:22:21.882,00:22:24.677,"Well, I feel very fortunate to have met you."
00:22:29.431,00:22:31.142,"No, no, I don't mean because of your vocation."
00:22:31.184,00:22:34.728,"I mean because you're a decent young man, and there are not many of those who make their way into Fox River."
00:22:38.274,00:22:39.566,"Well, that's good to hear."
00:22:47.407,00:22:51.204,"Well, let's just say that I owe you one."
00:22:58.627,00:23:02.131,"LINCOLN: So this whole thing, this whole time, it was never about me."
00:23:02.173,00:23:03.174,It was about Dad.
00:23:03.423,00:23:05.176,I can't believe it.
00:23:07.970,00:23:09.471,Michael. Michael!
00:23:12.641,00:23:15.393,"Just told you everything we knew about Dad was a lie, and you barely blinked."
00:23:18.856,00:23:20.983,We have to go. Tonight.
00:23:21.025,00:23:22.484,What are you talking about?
00:23:24.237,00:23:26.572,"Bellick found the hole, so either we go now or it's over."
00:23:27.614,00:23:29.242,Michael.
00:23:29.283,00:23:30.993,"Look, I know it's gonna be tight, but I can do this."
00:23:32.328,00:23:34.412,"The chains on your locks, they're..."
00:23:34.454,00:23:36.790,Michael! Michael!
00:23:39.459,00:23:41.128,Go. You gotta go.
00:23:41.170,00:23:42.420,Don't say that.
00:23:44.673,00:23:47.301,Look at me! You can't do this.
00:23:51.889,00:23:54.432,"I'm not asking you, man, I'm telling you."
00:24:00.189,00:24:01.232,Go.
00:24:29.843,00:24:33.806,What the hell you think you doing?
00:24:33.847,00:24:37.017,You trying to run something for those Wonder Breads you been running around with?
00:24:38.518,00:24:40.187,"Tell me something, boy."
00:24:40.229,00:24:42.564,Is you stepping or is you fetching?
00:24:42.606,00:24:47.194,I thought I made myself clear when I said your punk ass was no longer in business.
00:24:47.236,00:24:49.322,"This ain't business, all right? This is personal."
00:24:49.363,00:24:52.741,"What you got there anyway, some kind of cleaner?"
00:24:52.783,00:24:57.413,"What you trying to clean up, Sergeant Franklin?"
00:25:22.729,00:25:26.566,ANNOUNCER: There's breaking news report with implications in the race for the Presidency.
00:25:26.608,00:25:29.236,Political correspondent Nancy Lu has the details.
00:25:29.278,00:25:30.946,Nancy.
00:25:30.988,00:25:38.787,"NANCY: And rumors coming out of Vice President Reynolds' camp detail a preliminary short list of running mates should she, as expected, win her party's nomination."
00:25:38.829,00:25:43.376,Perhaps the biggest surprise is the inclusion of Illinois governor Frank Tancredi.
00:25:43.417,00:25:47.671,His consideration is attributed to his reputation for being tough on crime.
00:26:00.558,00:26:02.644,"Locally, a jackknifed big rig..."
00:26:53.362,00:26:55.697,"What the hell are you doing, John?"
00:26:55.739,00:26:58.075,Lord's work.
00:26:58.117,00:27:00.660,The Lord wants you to spread horse crap all over your mattress?
00:27:04.331,00:27:05.832,Are we clear?
00:27:28.730,00:27:29.315,Open on 88!
00:27:35.237,00:27:37.281,"Yo, what's that?"
00:27:38.740,00:27:41.619,He's getting out of the infirmary tonight.
00:27:42.786,00:27:45.747,So you got plenty of time to bake him a cake.
00:27:47.207,00:27:50.336,"Hey, I heard you were asking Patterson about Bellick."
00:27:51.587,00:27:53.339,Said you thought you saw him this morning?
00:27:57.384,00:27:58.385,Yeah. I was.
00:28:06.226,00:28:10.189,"No, it was yesterday."
00:28:10.772,00:28:11.731,You sure?
00:28:13.567,00:28:14.692,Yeah.
00:28:16.236,00:28:17.821,"You know, time just sort of blends together up in here."
00:28:20.157,00:28:21.908,All right.
00:28:23.910,00:28:24.370,Close on 88!
00:28:32.794,00:28:34.380,SUCRE: What am I supposed to do with this?
00:28:34.963,00:28:36.507,Pour it in the toilet.
00:28:36.549,00:28:39.510,You had C-Note steal some peroxide from the kitchen so we can clean the toilet?
00:28:39.552,00:28:42.388,We got to get all of us in the psych ward tonight to access the pipes.
00:28:42.429,00:28:47.059,A bunch of cons wearing their prison blues would stick out like a sore thumb.
00:28:47.100,00:28:48.101,But the inmates in the psych ward all wear...
00:28:50.354,00:28:51.313,Peroxide acts as a bleach.
00:29:01.114,00:29:03.200,Just a few more hours now.
00:29:04.368,00:29:06.786,Everything except your brother.
00:29:07.746,00:29:08.372,You worry about the suits.
00:29:10.123,00:29:12.376,I'll worry about Linc.
00:29:17.214,00:29:18.924,"Of course, Mr. President."
00:29:20.926,00:29:24.054,"If I were a betting man, I have a pretty good idea where I'd lay my chips."
00:29:24.096,00:29:27.307,"The energy bill, Richard."
00:29:27.349,00:29:33.813,"You've been saying for months it's so full of pork, the damn thing's ready to squeal, and--and now all of a..."
00:29:31.604,00:29:35.315,"Yes, the bill is flawed, but it's better than doing nothing."
00:29:35.357,00:29:41.238,"And, frankly, I find it a little curious that you're here, telling me to veto a bill you voted in favor of."
00:29:45.867,00:29:50.581,"Actually, I've been doing some thinking ahead as well, Caroline, specifically, about my endorsement."
00:29:50.623,00:29:52.874,What?
00:29:52.916,00:29:57.212,"I'm considering making a switch, throwing my weight behind Senator Challis."
00:29:58.297,00:29:58.756,You can't do that.
00:29:58.797,00:30:00.006,Can't I?
00:30:02.635,00:30:05.137,"Caroline, you are everything that's wrong with politics."
00:30:05.178,00:30:09.224,"You vote not to legislate change, but to profit."
00:30:09.849,00:30:12.185,"You run not to make a difference, but to make demands."
00:30:14.896,00:30:21.069,"You put me on your ticket not because I share your views, but because I didn't share your gender."
00:30:21.111,00:30:23.071,So don't take the moral high ground.
00:30:23.113,00:30:25.699,We all know how this game is played.
00:30:27.200,00:30:28.327,"Richard, please, I..."
00:30:28.368,00:30:30.996,Richard! Richard!
00:30:34.291,00:30:36.084,You know what I got my wife for our anniversary?
00:30:36.126,00:30:38.086,What?
00:30:38.128,00:30:40.964,"Well, this is a big one for me."
00:30:44.926,00:30:46.136,We'll do it all together on three.
00:30:46.178,00:30:48.221,Ready? One.
00:30:52.518,00:30:53.977,"Oh, no! Oh, no!"
00:30:58.190,00:30:59.358,"All right, get--get Scofield up here right away!"
00:31:01.193,00:31:03.362,It's working.
00:31:04.988,00:31:06.573,"All right, get them out and get them dry."
00:31:10.952,00:31:13.246,You think everyone else will be ready?
00:31:13.288,00:31:15.165,"As soon as the gate's open, we go."
00:31:15.207,00:31:16.458,And we're gonna need every second.
00:31:16.500,00:31:17.876,MACK: Open on 40.
00:31:21.171,00:31:22.422,"Scofield, Pope needs to see you, ASAP."
00:31:22.464,00:31:24.007,Now?
00:31:27.594,00:31:28.637,"It's 6:15, bro. You can't..."
00:32:45.589,00:32:47.132,Excuse me a minute.
00:32:52.387,00:32:54.306,I guess to congratulations.
00:32:57.267,00:32:59.144,"Oh, the VP thing."
00:33:00.061,00:33:01.438,What was it your mother used to say?
00:33:01.480,00:33:05.525,"It's always nice to be invited to the dance, even if you don't have the right shoes."
00:33:05.567,00:33:10.155,"Yeah. She also used to say, Your father's a lying bastard, but I figured that was just the booze talking."
00:33:11.490,00:33:12.449,"You know, it's always nice to see you, Sara."
00:33:12.491,00:33:14.242,Is there something that you needed?
00:33:14.284,00:33:16.829,Or did you just come by to...
00:33:20.248,00:33:22.041,"Sweetheart, move on."
00:33:22.083,00:33:24.419,"The man's attorneys had a window to present new evidence, they didn't."
00:33:24.461,00:33:26.254,Now that window is closed.
00:33:26.296,00:33:28.256,"I just need to know, did you look at the information?"
00:33:30.091,00:33:30.175,Answer me.
00:33:31.802,00:33:33.219,"I swear, working at Fox River has changed you."
00:33:33.261,00:33:35.221,You're always saying you want to make a difference?
00:33:35.263,00:33:38.308,At that place? It's too late.
00:33:38.350,00:33:42.312,"You should be a teacher, so that you can get to these people before they become..."
00:33:46.107,00:33:47.943,I supported the findings of the court.
00:33:49.361,00:33:51.446,"If you have a problem with the verdict, go after them."
00:33:53.114,00:33:58.495,"But before you do, I suggest you look at the guy's rap sheet and ask yourself if the world will be a better place with Lincoln Burrows walking the streets."
00:33:58.537,00:34:01.080,Just tell me one thing.
00:33:58.537,00:34:03.416,Did they promise you the vice presidency before or after you signed his death warrant?
00:34:03.458,00:34:07.086,I will not discuss morality with an addict and a thief.
00:34:07.128,00:34:08.463,"You want to talk reality, Sara?"
00:34:08.505,00:34:13.426,How many times did I use my influence to keep you and one of your junkie boyfriends out of jail?
00:34:13.468,00:34:15.303,How many?
00:34:15.345,00:34:17.096,"I swear, Sara, it's funny, you know?"
00:34:17.138,00:34:23.144,"You have no trouble whatsoever with me bending the law, especially when it's bent in your direction."
00:34:23.729,00:34:25.230,Grow up.
00:34:34.155,00:34:36.408,"Yeah, he says he got his days mixed up, but I don't know."
00:34:36.449,00:34:39.327,What?
00:34:39.369,00:34:41.830,"Oh, come on, man, Bellick's just taking a personal."
00:34:51.882,00:34:53.466,Okay. I'll tell him.
00:34:58.304,00:35:01.224,VERONICA: Did you call a cab for the airport?
00:35:01.266,00:35:03.268,"Why not? Come on, the flight leaves in an hour."
00:35:03.309,00:35:04.937,Yeah. Yeah.
00:35:06.772,00:35:09.148,I'm starting to think that us going to Montana might not be a good move.
00:35:14.195,00:35:17.198,You think they're just gonna let us walk in there and make a citizen's arrest?
00:35:17.240,00:35:20.326,"Look, Nick, I don't know what your deal is lately, but I'm getting on that plane with or without you."
00:35:24.247,00:35:27.125,I can't let you do that.
00:35:38.344,00:35:40.346,All this time you were one of them?
00:35:42.307,00:35:46.144,"Who's pulling your leash, Nick? Steadman? Kellerman?"
00:35:47.228,00:35:51.316,Look at me. I want you to remember my face when you do whatever the hell it is you're gonna do.
00:35:53.234,00:35:54.319,Look at me!
00:35:55.236,00:35:57.155,You're a coward.
00:36:08.500,00:36:11.210,"Oh, Scofield's outside, sir."
00:36:11.252,00:36:14.464,I want you to try every number we have for Brad Bellick.
00:36:23.306,00:36:25.224,Mrs. Bellick? Hi.
00:36:28.728,00:36:30.271,Mrs. Bellick?
00:36:30.313,00:36:32.357,"No cause for alarm, no, no."
00:36:30.313,00:36:35.276,"We haven't seen him, and we were wondering if he might be home under the weather."
00:36:41.282,00:36:44.410,So Brad called you when he pulled in this morning?
00:36:45.286,00:36:47.455,And he said he was here?
00:36:49.499,00:36:52.502,We'll keep you posted.
00:36:54.295,00:36:56.255,Radio Mack.
00:36:56.297,00:36:58.884,"If he finds it, have him call me immediately."
00:37:03.596,00:37:06.307,457. This is base.
00:37:14.357,00:37:18.444,"MARICRUZ: I'm pregnant, Fernando."
00:37:18.486,00:37:20.488,"But all I know is, is I'm really scared."
00:37:22.281,00:37:24.242,I'm really scared to do this alone.
00:37:31.332,00:37:33.043,"MAN: John, it's never too late."
00:37:33.085,00:37:40.425,"If you'll agree to accept Christ into your heart and turn from your sin, he will forgive you and save you in eternity."
00:37:42.343,00:37:43.344,I'll give you Fibonacci when the time is right.
00:37:43.386,00:37:45.304,The time is right now.
00:38:50.662,00:38:53.290,You only got one thing I need.
00:39:25.197,00:39:26.865,How long does she have?
00:41:21.354,00:41:29.612,"POPE: I read somewhere where the actual Taj Mahal appears pink in the morning, milky white in the evening and golden when the moon shines."
00:41:31.572,00:41:33.408,"The changes, they say, depict the different emotions of a woman."
00:41:47.755,00:41:50.175,What's this?
00:41:54.346,00:41:55.930,You took it?
00:41:57.432,00:41:59.517,I'm sorry.
00:42:00.726,00:42:02.854,But I needed to get back in here.
00:42:04.563,00:42:07.442,I--I don't understand.
00:42:08.776,00:42:11.279,And you're gonna make sure my brother goes with me.
00:00:01.293,00:00:05.923,SCOFIELD: Previously on Prison Break: I need you to let me get us out of here.
00:00:05.965,00:00:08.968,"If you try to screw me over again, I'll kill you."
00:00:17.142,00:00:20.521,"You know I can't let you leave here, boss."
00:00:30.739,00:00:32.658,I've been clean for 18 months now.
00:00:32.700,00:00:35.953,I want to help people get from where I've been to where I am.
00:00:35.995,00:00:39.080,"I'm getting my brother out of here tonight, and I need your help."
00:00:39.122,00:00:40.916,You're asking me to break the law.
00:00:40.958,00:00:41.625,I'm asking you to make a mistake.
00:00:41.667,00:00:43.460,Forget to lock up.
00:00:47.255,00:00:49.090,The inmates in the psych ward all wear...
00:00:55.138,00:00:56.515,She'll be at my place in about an hour.
00:00:56.557,00:00:58.099,"Pretty soon, we're going to call in our favor."
00:01:01.144,00:01:03.104,I can't let you do that.
00:01:08.151,00:01:09.236,"Well, not everybody gonna have a ticket."
00:01:09.277,00:01:17.870,"If you can't convince a doddering old fool what the best thing is for this country's economy, perhaps you're not the kind of helper we're looking for."
00:01:18.954,00:01:24.001,"I'm breaking out, and you're going to make sure my brother goes with me."
00:01:29.297,00:01:30.591,You son of a bitch.
00:01:30.632,00:01:32.384,"We're going to take this real easy, Warden."
00:01:32.426,00:01:34.636,I just need you to do a couple things for me.
00:01:37.180,00:01:38.265,MACK ON RADIO: Warden?
00:01:38.306,00:01:41.393,"Bellick's truck is here, sir."
00:01:41.435,00:01:43.645,Should we start looking for him?
00:01:44.897,00:01:46.105,"Michael, if you just put that shank down..."
00:01:46.147,00:01:49.818,"Tell the guard you spoke with Bellick, and he said he's taking some personal time."
00:01:49.860,00:01:51.236,"You can't possibly get away with this, son."
00:01:51.278,00:01:55.908,I don't think you want to find out how badly I want to get my brother out of here.
00:01:58.285,00:01:59.160,MACK: Sir?
00:01:59.202,00:02:00.120,"Yes, sir."
00:02:02.039,00:02:03.082,I just spoke with Bellick.
00:02:03.123,00:02:04.207,He's walked into town.
00:02:04.249,00:02:06.126,He's taking some personal time.
00:02:06.167,00:02:08.128,Is he all right?
00:02:10.213,00:02:11.298,He's fine.
00:02:11.339,00:02:12.633,Copy that.
00:02:14.885,00:02:17.638,Okay. I just need you to do one more thing.
00:02:22.225,00:02:23.143,And he needs to be there overnight.
00:02:32.235,00:02:33.570,"CORRECTIONAL OFFICER: Go ahead, sir."
00:02:33.612,00:02:35.697,Have Lincoln Burrows transferred to the infirmary.
00:02:45.248,00:02:51.212,"I'm sorry you got caught in the middle, but, one day, you'll understand why I did this."
00:02:51.254,00:02:53.757,You'll never make it over the wall.
00:03:58.613,00:03:59.239,Everything all right?
00:04:00.908,00:04:04.953,"Yeah, he's getting an earful from someone over at the DOC."
00:04:06.413,00:04:08.248,Oh. Is he on with Mr. Drushal?
00:04:08.289,00:04:14.295,"I'm not sure, but it's turning into a conference call and he said he didn't want to be disturbed."
00:04:16.339,00:04:18.299,Have a good night.
00:04:21.595,00:04:27.308,"You know, he can be a big old grump sometimes, but I hope you know how highly he thinks of you."
00:04:27.350,00:04:31.897,There's no way he'd get that Taj Mahal done in time for his anniversary without your help.
00:04:52.375,00:04:54.878,It's 6:55.
00:04:56.046,00:04:57.965,That's five minutes till tier.
00:04:58.006,00:04:59.299,It's one hour till the next count.
00:05:01.384,00:05:05.305,One hour to get over that wall and as far away from this prison as possible.
00:06:27.470,00:06:29.556,"You unscrewed the toilet, right?"
00:06:31.474,00:06:33.810,That's five minutes we don't have.
00:06:52.453,00:06:53.788,Are you okay?
00:06:57.625,00:07:07.094,"If we get caught, I can't do 10 more years, bro."
00:07:10.305,00:07:13.225,"GUARD: Tier time, one hour!"
00:08:17.664,00:08:21.251,"If you get stuck in one of them pipes, boy..."
00:08:27.257,00:08:30.844,"T-BAG: Keep walking, Bull, keep walking."
00:08:33.596,00:08:34.555,Great.
00:08:49.070,00:08:50.780,It's got blue spots.
00:08:52.615,00:08:54.701,Only one thing you needed to do.
00:08:54.742,00:08:56.453,Block the gate.
00:09:03.210,00:09:06.546,"Said a prayer for you, Theodore."
00:09:07.464,00:09:09.466,Said a prayer for us all.
00:09:30.653,00:09:32.613,I want him dead.
00:09:32.655,00:09:35.200,"Anybody gets in the way, gets run over."
00:09:46.920,00:09:48.963,"MACK: Hey, do you want some coffee?"
00:09:50.715,00:09:53.968,"If I have more than that, I'll be up all night."
00:09:54.010,00:09:55.011,"Thank you, bro."
00:10:13.572,00:10:15.823,How many more screws?
00:10:33.007,00:10:40.140,"That's real touching and all, you sticking up for a brother, but y'all need to step aside, right now."
00:10:51.776,00:10:53.194,Something you need?
00:10:59.242,00:11:01.119,"Told you, we haven't seen him."
00:11:15.258,00:11:18.386,"GUARD: Wilson, medical eval, five minutes."
00:11:18.428,00:11:20.180,"Ramirez, report to the..."
00:11:26.978,00:11:31.107,"No. No, I never stopped fighting for Lincoln's innocence, never."
00:11:31.149,00:11:33.734,They approached me after I took this case.
00:11:38.031,00:11:39.032,"Yes, yes."
00:11:39.782,00:11:40.950,How much did he pay you?
00:11:40.992,00:11:43.744,My father's freedom.
00:11:43.786,00:11:45.163,You said your father was exonerated.
00:11:46.789,00:11:49.417,I agreed to keep tabs on you.
00:11:46.789,00:11:52.504,"In exchange, Abruzzi had some guy who was already doing a life sentence cop to the murder that my father didn't commit."
00:11:52.546,00:11:54.713,And that's how I got him out of jail.
00:11:55.798,00:11:57.050,Your dad's life for mine.
00:11:57.091,00:11:59.260,"No one needs to get hurt here, Veronica."
00:11:59.302,00:12:00.970,"Oh, you think Abruzzi wants legal advice from me?"
00:12:01.012,00:12:05.724,"All you have to do is make sure Michael gives this Abruzzi guy what he needs to know, that's it."
00:12:07.310,00:12:10.771,"Nick, you don't think they're gonna let me live, do you?"
00:12:15.443,00:12:17.362,I gotta believe that.
00:12:23.451,00:12:26.204,Yeah. Okay.
00:12:27.830,00:12:28.789,Right.
00:12:37.882,00:12:39.008,Charles.
00:12:47.434,00:12:49.102,Here you go.
00:12:50.311,00:12:52.105,"Sucre, drop the sheet."
00:12:56.234,00:12:58.236,"Manche, you're next."
00:12:59.862,00:13:01.155,Let's move it.
00:13:03.074,00:13:05.702,That one's for you.
00:13:07.203,00:13:08.246,Move your fat ass.
00:13:17.130,00:13:18.298,That's for you.
00:13:27.890,00:13:28.975,All right.
00:13:42.113,00:13:43.114,"So, you got a key to the infirmary?"
00:13:44.907,00:13:46.075,Not exactly.
00:14:18.316,00:14:20.901,All right.
00:14:20.943,00:14:22.945,Not good.
00:14:22.987,00:14:23.904,Let's move it.
00:14:23.946,00:14:25.114,Give me that.
00:15:14.748,00:15:18.292,Help!
00:15:18.334,00:15:22.171,Help!
00:15:28.010,00:15:29.929,Help!
00:15:30.179,00:15:31.514,Help!
00:15:34.100,00:15:36.977,Did you hear that?
00:15:37.019,00:15:38.187,Hear what?
00:15:41.190,00:15:42.316,Help!
00:15:58.040,00:15:59.041,MACK: Hear anything?
00:16:00.293,00:16:03.087,"There's nobody here, man."
00:16:04.046,00:16:06.132,"I swear, I heard something."
00:16:09.135,00:16:10.470,"Come on, let's go."
00:16:12.054,00:16:18.018,"You scream and I'll cut out your windpipe, got me?"
00:16:18.060,00:16:19.979,I need his jacket and his hat.
00:16:59.268,00:17:00.520,"Evening, Doc."
00:17:05.107,00:17:06.359,"Brains of the outfit, huh, Scofield?"
00:17:08.653,00:17:11.071,"He's leading you off a cliff, boys."
00:17:14.241,00:17:16.035,"Shut your mouth, bitch."
00:17:19.455,00:17:21.165,Let's go.
00:17:58.118,00:18:00.120,"Nick, please don't do this."
00:18:00.162,00:18:03.123,Tell Michael to give Abruzzi what he wants.
00:18:03.165,00:18:06.252,"Please, Nick, come on, they're going to kill me."
00:18:09.714,00:18:11.049,"No, Nick."
00:18:12.174,00:18:13.300,Everyone put your coveralls on.
00:18:13.342,00:18:16.012,I'll be back in a minute.
00:18:16.054,00:18:17.430,"Yo, where you going, man?"
00:18:18.180,00:18:19.223,Hey!
00:18:19.265,00:18:22.101,You heard him. Come on.
00:18:24.186,00:18:26.105,"This is ridiculous, man."
00:18:49.545,00:18:51.213,"One, three, five, eight."
00:18:59.221,00:19:00.347,"Eight, one, three, five."
00:19:17.281,00:19:20.200,"The scope of this, which we're all aware of, can cloud judgment."
00:19:20.242,00:19:23.203,I suggest we look at this in very simple terms.
00:19:23.245,00:19:26.206,"We have an employee, she's not working out."
00:19:26.248,00:19:28.375,We fire her.
00:19:28.417,00:19:30.128,It needs to be that simple.
00:19:30.169,00:19:31.378,She's the Vice President of the United States.
00:19:31.420,00:19:33.213,And that's all she'll ever be.
00:19:44.266,00:19:47.227,Fine.
00:19:47.269,00:19:51.273,How do we know she'll keep her mouth shut on everything she knows?
00:19:56.278,00:19:59.115,"Yes, sir."
00:19:59.157,00:20:00.240,"I need a very frank assessment from you, right now."
00:20:00.282,00:20:03.410,"Based on your contact with her, will the Vice President go quietly?"
00:20:06.288,00:20:08.374,No. Absolutely not.
00:20:08.415,00:20:11.127,Becoming president is the most important thing to her.
00:20:14.296,00:20:19.510,"And I guarantee you, she will do everything she can to take everyone she can down with her."
00:20:28.602,00:20:30.521,"Okay, here we go. Go."
00:20:36.152,00:20:37.277,"You okay, Doc?"
00:21:25.451,00:21:27.369,What's going on?
00:21:27.411,00:21:29.247,I don't know.
00:21:29.288,00:21:31.331,"What are we supposed to do, just sit here?"
00:21:31.373,00:21:33.292,No. I don't know!
00:21:33.333,00:21:36.879,"Man. This whole thing is messed up, bro."
00:21:36.921,00:21:39.298,"Feel free not to come, Gordo."
00:22:02.822,00:22:05.574,We're screwed. We're screwed!
00:22:06.408,00:22:07.326,"Come on, let's go! Let's..."
00:22:07.367,00:22:08.535,"Michael, we got to go back."
00:22:08.577,00:22:10.079,We're moving forward.
00:22:12.414,00:22:13.540,Do you hear that?
00:22:13.582,00:22:15.375,It's the fire alarm in psych ward.
00:22:15.417,00:22:16.418,SUCRE: How do you know?
00:22:17.503,00:22:18.671,Why?
00:22:23.425,00:22:26.428,MAN ON P.A.: Exit the building in an orderly fashion.
00:22:29.223,00:22:31.767,Exit the building in an orderly fashion.
00:23:13.475,00:23:15.978,We're in the sticks.
00:23:16.020,00:23:18.438,You know how many people would have heard a jet like this land?
00:23:18.480,00:23:21.025,Don't worry about it.
00:23:26.280,00:23:27.447,False alarm.
00:23:30.534,00:23:32.410,"Walk in with me, now."
00:23:34.038,00:23:35.748,Just gonna keep on walking.
00:23:35.789,00:23:37.583,"Come on, guys, you heard him."
00:23:39.501,00:23:42.296,"Come on, let's go."
00:23:43.756,00:23:45.383,That's it.
00:24:06.528,00:24:08.446,Cool.
00:24:09.282,00:24:10.241,Let's go!
00:24:14.078,00:24:15.413,Wait a minute.
00:24:15.453,00:24:16.622,That's not wack-shack-issue.
00:24:16.663,00:24:17.998,"Everybody, stop!"
00:24:18.040,00:24:19.499,Stay where you are!
00:24:19.541,00:24:21.377,"I said, stay where you are."
00:24:21.961,00:24:22.460,What's the problem?
00:24:27.007,00:24:28.426,That's John Abruzzi right there.
00:24:28.466,00:24:32.638,"Yeah, that's, uh..."
00:24:35.557,00:24:36.934,Yeah.
00:24:38.769,00:24:39.979,Yeah.
00:24:40.020,00:24:41.397,Let's have it.
00:24:44.566,00:24:46.693,"This will put him out, right?"
00:24:46.735,00:24:47.987,Like a light.
00:24:57.579,00:24:58.622,Where are we going?
00:25:26.859,00:25:28.235,Come on.
00:25:28.652,00:25:30.570,What's going on?
00:25:30.612,00:25:32.156,I'm getting you to the airport.
00:25:32.198,00:25:33.573,"Go, go, go."
00:25:33.615,00:25:35.242,"You get to Blackfoot, you find Steadman."
00:25:41.499,00:25:43.083,"I'm sorry about this, okay?"
00:25:43.125,00:25:44.460,"You gotta believe me, I'm sorry."
00:25:47.463,00:25:48.506,Take her to O'Hare.
00:25:48.546,00:25:49.965,DRIVER: You bet.
00:25:55.137,00:25:57.597,"Dad, you still got the key to my apartment?"
00:25:57.639,00:25:59.350,"Yeah, just meet me there."
00:26:16.658,00:26:18.244,"Halfway there, yo."
00:26:21.914,00:26:22.998,What's up?
00:26:24.375,00:26:26.710,I don't know what you're talking about.
00:26:26.752,00:26:29.547,"But I owed you, and I pay my debts."
00:26:34.634,00:26:36.011,You understand?
00:26:57.699,00:26:58.951,"Oh, Sara."
00:27:00.702,00:27:01.537,That's what all that racket was about.
00:27:05.165,00:27:06.459,Good night.
00:27:17.677,00:27:21.723,"Hey. Look, baby, it ain't worth it if it's gonna kill you."
00:27:22.600,00:27:24.143,I'm getting out of here.
00:27:41.785,00:27:43.203,"Good night, Doctor."
00:28:08.103,00:28:09.729,You're overreacting.
00:28:11.815,00:28:16.320,"And I am telling you, the company is selling me down the river."
00:28:16.362,00:28:18.489,It's a Legend for Literacy fundraiser.
00:28:18.531,00:28:19.739,It doesn't mean anything.
00:28:19.781,00:28:21.741,It's a rubber-chicken dinner.
00:28:23.369,00:28:29.166,"You don't do that to your candidate, unless the candidate is no longer your candidate."
00:28:31.877,00:28:34.588,How can you not understand this is so beyond me.
00:28:44.806,00:28:46.600,Listen to me. Listen to me.
00:28:50.812,00:28:52.814,So you need to be strong.
00:28:52.856,00:28:57.611,"Be presidential, and you get through this."
00:29:07.705,00:29:12.959,"I'm figuring I'll need a two-inch lift, if I'm gonna run with the new set of 30-by-nine-and-a-halfs."
00:29:13.001,00:29:18.840,"Question is, add coil springs or just stay with the spacers?"
00:29:18.882,00:29:20.300,What do you think?
00:29:21.427,00:29:22.678,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
00:29:22.720,00:29:24.012,"Easy, hey."
00:29:24.930,00:29:25.723,I ain't a hero for $14 an hour.
00:29:25.764,00:29:27.683,You do what you will.
00:29:27.725,00:29:29.268,Uncuff my brother.
00:29:29.309,00:29:29.768,"You got it, boss."
00:29:39.194,00:29:40.820,"Pretend I ain't here, boss."
00:29:40.862,00:29:42.781,"Oh, yeah."
00:29:52.583,00:29:54.918,"Dad, are you here?"
00:29:56.086,00:29:58.004,"Dad, you gotta get ready."
00:30:01.341,00:30:03.176,"How's it going, Savrinn?"
00:30:22.404,00:30:27.284,"MAN: And I get why the guy's lighting the candle, but why are the other two playing the bagpipes?"
00:30:28.994,00:30:31.037,Welcome to Joke Line.
00:30:31.079,00:30:32.790,What the hell?
00:30:32.831,00:30:34.249,...50 cents for each additional minute.
00:30:34.291,00:30:36.126,Where's the lawyer?
00:30:36.168,00:30:37.127,She's gone.
00:30:37.169,00:30:38.420,Yeah?
00:30:40.172,00:30:41.089,Then so is your dad.
00:30:41.131,00:30:41.423,"No, no, no!"
00:30:42.882,00:30:43.883,Don't.
00:30:43.925,00:30:45.678,Have you got her or not?
00:30:45.719,00:30:47.721,I can find her.
00:30:47.846,00:30:49.889,And will you have her in front of me in the next two minutes?
00:30:49.931,00:30:51.308,"It's a very simple question, Nick."
00:30:52.351,00:30:55.020,No. Just...
00:30:55.061,00:30:57.897,You just got to listen to me.
00:30:57.939,00:31:00.900,Hey!
00:31:02.944,00:31:04.738,Where's the lawyer?
00:31:14.164,00:31:15.541,Where's the lawyer?
00:31:20.086,00:31:22.548,She's about a million miles away from here.
00:31:22.589,00:31:24.924,You're never gonna find her.
00:31:24.966,00:31:26.885,Why don't you just sock it?
00:31:56.331,00:31:57.583,We're in.
00:32:30.490,00:32:32.826,Is this gonna work?
00:32:32.868,00:32:33.702,We're about to find out.
00:32:40.041,00:32:40.709,BECKY: Warden?
00:32:45.004,00:32:46.047,Warden?
00:33:03.315,00:33:04.650,Ready.
00:33:07.068,00:33:07.694,Pull that. Come on.
00:33:19.331,00:33:21.959,"What now, genius?"
00:33:32.051,00:33:33.178,Take your time.
00:34:16.262,00:34:17.973,We're through.
00:34:26.314,00:34:27.649,"SCOFIELD: Let's go, guys, I need those suits."
00:34:32.153,00:34:32.445,"Good job, kiddo."
00:34:38.243,00:34:39.703,Take this.
00:34:45.876,00:34:47.126,HAYWIRE: I knew it.
00:34:48.169,00:34:49.504,I knew it.
00:34:49.546,00:34:51.673,"As soon as I saw you go into psych ward, I knew it."
00:34:55.260,00:34:57.136,You want me to make a little person-to-person call here?
00:34:57.178,00:34:58.847,"Haywire, just take it easy."
00:34:58.889,00:35:01.641,The other person being a correctional officer.
00:35:03.184,00:35:04.436,What?
00:35:05.520,00:35:06.980,You're crazy!
00:35:12.193,00:35:14.195,"Whoa, hold on, A-bruzzi."
00:35:16.823,00:35:18.199,Line forms after me.
00:35:27.292,00:35:28.251,Got it?
00:35:30.420,00:35:31.964,"Yeah. Go, go, go."
00:35:41.222,00:35:42.181,"Hey, Roy?"
00:35:42.223,00:35:43.182,Yeah?
00:35:43.224,00:35:43.683,Did you see Pope leave?
00:35:43.725,00:35:45.769,No.
00:35:45.811,00:35:47.062,No way he could have walked by?
00:36:46.287,00:36:47.288,All right.
00:37:41.218,00:37:42.301,"Hey, hey, hey."
00:37:43.261,00:37:44.387,"You okay, old man?"
00:37:44.429,00:37:45.597,No.
00:37:45.805,00:37:47.265,Let's take a look.
00:37:57.483,00:37:59.652,It's just a few more steps.
00:37:59.694,00:38:01.320,You can make it.
00:38:01.362,00:38:05.742,"Oh, I could make it another foot, maybe two, but why?"
00:38:05.784,00:38:07.535,I wasn't going for me.
00:38:07.577,00:38:09.328,I was going for my daughter.
00:38:16.294,00:38:17.295,"Yes, I promise."
00:38:18.922,00:38:28.140,"The money is buried under a silo at the Double K Ranch just outside of Tooele, Utah."
00:38:33.394,00:38:40.068,"The government didn't want any more embarrassment after I took off with the money, so they lowballed it to the papers."
00:38:40.110,00:38:45.323,"The truth is, Michael, it's not $1 million under that silo."
00:38:46.241,00:38:49.286,There's $5 million there.
00:39:08.096,00:39:09.597,You check the chow hall?
00:39:09.639,00:39:11.474,Yeah. Nothing.
00:39:12.475,00:39:14.019,Anybody try his cell phone?
00:39:14.060,00:39:15.312,Oh.
00:39:17.438,00:39:21.359,Give Anna her Papa's love.
00:39:22.694,00:39:25.363,I will. I will.
00:39:35.373,00:39:37.458,"Here, easy, easy."
00:39:53.474,00:39:55.310,"Now, where is that coming from?"
00:40:03.109,00:40:04.443,"Oh! Oh, my God."
00:40:04.485,00:40:05.444,"Control, this is S and E 5."
00:40:05.486,00:40:06.738,I have a code three in the warden's office.
00:40:06.779,00:40:08.240,"I repeat, code three."
00:40:08.281,00:40:09.324,Sound the alarm.
00:40:09.366,00:40:10.616,Patterson to Base.
00:40:10.658,00:40:12.660,"No, right now."
00:40:25.506,00:40:27.217,"Yo, bro, we gotta go."
00:40:27.259,00:40:28.426,"Go, Michael."
00:40:28.551,00:40:30.553,"Go, and don't look back."
00:40:36.517,00:40:37.476,"No, no, no."
00:40:37.518,00:40:38.477,Go on.
00:40:38.519,00:40:39.604,I better go last.
00:40:42.565,00:40:45.443,"Come on, Michael!"
00:40:49.989,00:40:51.783,"Michael, move it!"
00:40:53.534,00:40:56.371,"MAN ON P.A.: All prisoners, prepare for immediate shakedown."
00:41:09.384,00:41:11.594,"Michael, come on!"
00:41:11.636,00:41:13.221,"Michael, come on."
00:41:46.587,00:41:48.506,"Go, go, go."
00:41:50.175,00:41:52.093,"Come on, move it!"
00:41:59.809,00:42:01.394,Michael!
00:42:02.603,00:42:03.604,"Michael, grab my hand."
00:42:11.612,00:42:13.614,Give me your hand. Come on.
00:42:28.754,00:42:31.174,Check out the wire.
00:42:33.134,00:42:35.136,Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
00:42:35.178,00:42:36.595,Get down!
00:00:01.961,00:00:03.754,SCOFIELD: Previously on Prison Break.
00:00:06.089,00:00:08.425,They both want out of here.
00:00:20.103,00:00:22.690,"He's leading you off a cliff, boys."
00:00:39.122,00:00:42.125,We have an employee.
00:00:45.128,00:00:47.088,She's the Vice President of the United States.
00:00:50.133,00:00:52.093,"You get to Blackfoot, you find Steadman."
00:00:52.135,00:00:53.679,Just...
00:01:03.188,00:01:04.899,We're through.
00:01:21.999,00:01:25.126,"Hey, hey, hey."
00:01:25.168,00:01:26.127,No!
00:01:26.169,00:01:27.838,"Oh, my God!"
00:01:30.173,00:01:31.299,"Come on, Michael!"
00:01:31.341,00:01:32.801,Sound the alarm!
00:01:32.843,00:01:33.802,LINCOLN: Come on!
00:01:40.267,00:01:42.101,"Michael, come on, move it!"
00:01:48.191,00:01:50.569,Grab my hand.
00:02:21.266,00:02:25.312,"Don't shoot, please!"
00:02:31.234,00:02:32.653,Nobody!
00:02:34.613,00:02:37.198,"Talk or I swear to God, I'll snap your neck right here!"
00:02:40.243,00:02:41.745,Names. I want names.
00:02:49.294,00:02:51.170,And that Vanilla Ice kid.
00:02:53.256,00:02:58.177,"Bagwell, man. C-Note. Abruzzi."
00:02:58.971,00:03:00.514,And that bug-eyed J-Cat..
00:03:01.640,00:03:03.266,Was there anybody else?
00:03:04.267,00:03:05.519,Was there anybody else?
00:03:18.239,00:03:20.241,MAN ON P.A.: We got inmates over the wall.
00:03:20.283,00:03:21.451,How many?
00:04:35.358,00:04:36.777,Get me my shotgun.
00:04:36.818,00:04:38.695,Pope's already given orders for all the COs to hit the streets.
00:04:44.118,00:04:49.497,"Those piles of crap, doing what they just did, they just signed their death warrant."
00:04:51.708,00:04:53.293,Every last one of them.
00:05:00.717,00:05:04.888,"POPE ON MEGAPHONE: When those men went over the wall, they made a choice."
00:05:04.930,00:05:08.016,That choice makes them a threat to society once again.
00:05:08.058,00:05:12.271,"Now, as many of you know, some of those men are convicted killers."
00:05:13.272,00:05:17.234,"Now, our job is to protect and ensure the safety of the general population."
00:05:19.319,00:05:24.365,"That means if we have to bring them down to ensure that safety, by God we will do it!"
00:05:24.407,00:05:27.702,"This time we're playing for keeps, gentlemen."
00:05:31.414,00:05:33.667,That's one mile on foot at best.
00:05:37.420,00:05:39.798,So let's get moving!
00:06:15.125,00:06:17.376,"I don't know if we're gonna get a chance, papi."
00:06:17.418,00:06:19.213,Dogs. Son of a bitch.
00:06:20.421,00:06:22.716,They're coming right for us.
00:06:30.807,00:06:32.433,They can't smell us.
00:07:37.457,00:07:40.543,"Hey, this is Nick."
00:07:40.585,00:07:43.171,"Hey, Nick, it's me."
00:07:45.090,00:07:50.429,"And this house, it's got something to do with Terrence Steadman's murder, I know it."
00:07:50.470,00:07:55.392,"And if whatever's here can help free Lincoln, then I wanted to say thank you."
00:07:55.434,00:07:56.476,Bye.
00:07:58.561,00:08:02.482,Soft money makes the world go round.
00:08:02.523,00:08:06.527,You cut my funding and I can't run a proper campaign without it.
00:08:06.569,00:08:08.947,"There was a lot of internal debate, trust me."
00:08:21.584,00:08:27.799,"Well, actually, I came here to express our gratitude for all that you've done for us over the years."
00:08:27.841,00:08:30.135,And to let you know that this isn't personal.
00:08:30.177,00:08:32.262,Surely you've been in politics long enough to know that.
00:08:32.304,00:08:35.723,"Look, is this about the energy bill?"
00:08:35.765,00:08:37.976,The energy bill has nothing to do with it.
00:08:42.647,00:08:45.150,I'm a grown woman.
00:08:46.234,00:08:47.568,How about you give it to me straight?
00:08:47.610,00:08:49.821,All right.
00:08:53.574,00:08:58.538,"The bottom line, Madam Vice President, is that you can't effect change in the Oval Office."
00:08:58.579,00:09:01.666,And that is what we need the most. Certitude.
00:09:02.625,00:09:06.587,"Simply put, you can't get things done."
00:09:09.632,00:09:11.968,"Well, maybe you don't know me so well."
00:09:18.141,00:09:29.194,"I highly suggest that in the coming weeks, as the race narrows and the candidates start falling out, that you walk away, quietly, of your own volition."
00:09:48.629,00:09:52.217,"Hey, hey, take the suit off."
00:09:53.634,00:09:56.430,I'll freeze to death!
00:09:56.471,00:09:58.515,Hurry up.
00:09:58.557,00:10:01.601,"You got it, dude. Come on."
00:10:13.696,00:10:15.615,Where the hell is the van?
00:10:18.993,00:10:20.787,Ye of little faith.
00:10:37.345,00:10:38.805,I told you. I told you.
00:10:40.223,00:10:41.682,"Behind the wheel, Cro-Magnon."
00:10:51.025,00:10:53.945,What the hell you doing?
00:11:10.753,00:11:13.006,What are you waiting for?
00:11:13.047,00:11:14.424,"Oh, the keys."
00:11:19.762,00:11:21.680,The keys.
00:11:23.933,00:11:26.645,Must find the car keys.
00:11:28.355,00:11:30.689,The keys. The keys.
00:11:31.650,00:11:33.151,There's not even a plastic bag.
00:11:46.789,00:11:50.001,We got the on-ramps to 55 and 80 being monitored.
00:11:50.043,00:11:52.920,"We've got traffic checks on 171, 6 and 53."
00:11:58.801,00:12:00.845,They're being set up on all the family members of the escapees as we speak.
00:12:00.887,00:12:04.683,Surveillance teams are being established outside the residences as well.
00:12:12.899,00:12:15.276,I don't see how that's possible.
00:12:15.318,00:12:17.945,These doors are locked down every night when we leave.
00:12:19.822,00:12:21.575,What?
00:12:34.879,00:12:40.759,"Hey, John, I've got to ask you, uh, why you were so intent on Lincoln driving here and you taking that particular seat?"
00:12:52.606,00:12:53.940,What the hell are you doing?
00:12:58.861,00:13:04.075,"You shoot me, pretty here will be dragging around 170 pounds of dead Alabama flesh with him."
00:13:04.117,00:13:07.537,And considering how much you need him to get this little Fibonacci vendetta of yours...
00:13:09.205,00:13:11.790,So I just don't think you're gonna be pulling that trigger.
00:13:15.545,00:13:16.630,No.

00:15:09.992,00:15:10.951,What did it look like?
00:15:10.993,00:15:14.955,"Um, like a... Like a van."
00:15:14.997,00:15:17.958,And you didn't think to report it to the authorities?
00:15:19.001,00:15:20.294,A parked car?

00:15:47.321,00:15:48.698,"I guess five miles, maybe."
00:15:54.078,00:15:56.997,"You know your jet better be there, Mr. Mafia."

00:16:32.074,00:16:33.534,"Honestly, I don't."
00:16:33.576,00:16:35.119,"The door was left open, Katie."
00:16:35.161,00:16:36.955,It wasn't me.
00:16:36.996,00:16:39.540,Only you and Dr. Tancredi were left at the end of the night.
00:16:39.582,00:16:41.041,The orderly confirmed that.
00:16:41.083,00:16:42.418,It wasn't me.

00:16:58.100,00:17:01.729,And I will press that button if you don't start talking!
00:17:07.568,00:17:10.029,What about Sara?
00:17:10.321,00:17:13.073,Sara had a thing for Scofield.
00:17:26.128,00:17:31.885,"All I want to do is touch her belly, feel that he's in there."
00:17:33.636,00:17:39.266,"After that, whatever I got to do, I'll figure it out."
00:17:41.101,00:17:43.062,I just want to touch her belly.
00:17:44.146,00:17:45.815,"We're close, papi."

00:18:08.421,00:18:11.007,Any other way to the airstrip?
00:18:14.176,00:18:16.721,Can we go back?
00:18:21.350,00:18:23.477,Maybe not. We've got to try and go around.

00:19:31.253,00:19:32.630,"Oh, we'll manage, won't we?"
00:19:32.672,00:19:35.215,"Sure, pretty."
00:19:36.258,00:19:37.802,Let's get out of here!

00:19:43.141,00:19:45.559,"What? No, man, you can't leave me out here, not like this."
00:19:45.601,00:19:46.435,"We had a deal, remember?"
00:19:48.479,00:19:50.356,"Yeah, but come on, bro."
00:19:59.699,00:20:01.868,Now walk.

00:21:09.060,00:21:11.270,MAN: This area clear.
00:21:21.280,00:21:24.242,"It's coming back, y'all, it's coming back!"

00:22:33.686,00:22:34.854,What can I do for you?
00:22:35.896,00:22:38.398,Sort of was gonna ask you the same question.
00:22:39.692,00:22:41.610,There's no traffic allowed here after sundown.
00:22:43.445,00:22:44.530,You need me to take a look at anything?
00:22:44.571,00:22:45.405,"No, no, we got it."
00:22:47.491,00:22:50.410,Don't trouble yourself.
00:22:53.455,00:22:56.000,Okay.
00:23:11.473,00:23:13.809,"Hey, it's me."
00:23:15.435,00:23:20.191,I think you better have a look at it.
00:23:22.484,00:23:24.444,Hurry it up.
00:23:28.241,00:23:30.450,You know what you're doing?
00:23:30.492,00:23:33.204,Hot-wiring this thing is like hot-wiring a toaster.
00:23:33.246,00:23:37.375,"Now, if it were to be an Acura, or one of those Chinese cars, that's a whole different story."
00:23:41.670,00:23:43.505,"But, no, we're good."

00:24:05.569,00:24:11.242,"Ain't never been nowhere except for Iraq, Chi-Town and Fox River."
00:24:16.830,00:24:23.296,"Look, man, is it a good place where you can have a family?"
00:24:25.005,00:24:27.925,"Lots of families down there, so I hear."
00:24:30.386,00:24:34.974,"For a black man, an American man with a family."
00:24:38.560,00:24:40.104,They're gonna meet you down in Mexico?
00:24:41.021,00:24:43.523,"Yeah, it's worse to not see them."
00:24:48.070,00:24:50.156,But it'll be a life.
00:24:51.949,00:24:55.493,"More than what me and them have been having for the last two years, man."
00:24:59.457,00:25:00.498,"They're family, snowflake."
00:25:02.584,00:25:05.463,Ain't no way in hell I'm leaving them behind.
00:25:08.424,00:25:12.052,We're good.
00:25:12.094,00:25:14.596,"Man, I thought you got busted for armed robbery."
00:25:15.597,00:25:17.224,That's what they caught me for.
00:25:18.392,00:25:21.437,"Red's the juice, white is the ground."

00:25:56.972,00:25:57.555,It's okay.
00:26:16.658,00:26:18.160,Sorry.
00:26:30.672,00:26:37.471,"They're on foot, and judging by how hot this engine is, they haven't gone far."
00:26:50.776,00:26:52.570,Units are in place along all those roads.
00:26:52.610,00:26:53.904,And I've got a dozen more coming.
00:26:53.946,00:26:57.615,"Brad, this could be over quicker than we thought."
00:26:58.409,00:27:00.202,We've got them boxed in.
00:27:06.708,00:27:08.586,None of the staff had any interaction with her.
00:27:08.626,00:27:14.716,"She left work suddenly in the early afternoon, returned for maybe an hour, then left again."
00:27:14.758,00:27:16.302,Has anyone been able to reach her?
00:27:16.343,00:27:18.929,"Doesn't have a home line, cell phone seems to be shut off."
00:27:18.971,00:27:21.681,Chicago PD identified her car outside her residence.
00:27:21.723,00:27:23.641,They're getting an emergency warrant to go in.

00:29:53.500,00:29:57.879,Punishing companies for being a good business model doesn't make a whole lot of sense to this administration.

00:30:00.882,00:30:03.719,Thank you.

00:40:50.615,00:40:52.491,C-NOTE: What's the deal? Hey!
00:40:52.533,00:40:54.452,ALL: Hey!
00:41:14.555,00:41:16.975,What do we do now?
00:41:22.605,00:41:24.690,We run.
00:41:34.575,00:41:36.535,MAN ON MEGAPHONE: Stop and put your hands up.
00:41:36.577,00:41:38.455,You are completely surrounded.
00:41:41.582,00:41:45.586,Stop and put your hands up.
00:00:06.089,00:00:07.549,I was set up.
00:00:11.094,00:00:13.639,I find it incumbent that you see the inside of a prison cell.
00:00:13.681,00:00:14.974,MICHAEL: I'm looking for someone.
00:00:15.015,00:00:16.266,A guy named Lincoln Burrows.
00:00:16.308,00:00:17.810,SUCRE: Man killed the Vice President's brother.
00:00:17.852,00:00:18.936,Why you want to see Burrows so bad anyhow?
00:00:20.103,00:00:21.647,I'm getting you out of here.
00:00:23.106,00:00:24.441,"Not if you designed the place, it isn't."
00:00:28.111,00:00:30.531,You find out who's trying to bury him.
00:00:33.241,00:00:34.535,There's a lawyer poking around.
00:00:43.126,00:00:45.044,"Now, where is Fibonacci?"
00:00:45.086,00:00:47.673,"I give you that information, I'm a dead man."
00:00:47.715,00:00:49.008,Three.
00:01:10.571,00:01:11.864,On your feet.
00:01:13.156,00:01:14.742,What time is it?
00:01:15.492,00:01:16.952,BELLICK: Get up.
00:01:19.162,00:01:20.539,No! Bellick!
00:01:20.581,00:01:21.248,Come on. Move it.
00:01:23.166,00:01:26.587,No! Bellick! Bellick!
00:01:26.628,00:01:27.086,"No, no!"
00:01:28.964,00:01:31.050,"Bellick, where you taking..."
00:01:31.090,00:01:32.760,"Bellick, no!"
00:01:33.635,00:01:36.055,"No. Bellick, no. Bellick, no."
00:01:36.095,00:01:38.139,I got a month left. Please!
00:01:38.181,00:01:40.099,"No, Bellick!"
00:01:40.559,00:01:41.643,"Bellick, no!"
00:01:41.685,00:01:43.062,"Bellick, please."
00:01:43.102,00:01:46.648,No! No!
00:01:47.148,00:01:49.068,Bellick!
00:02:22.726,00:02:24.352,"Make your peace, Lincoln."
00:02:31.693,00:02:32.152,Let's get on with it.
00:03:20.117,00:03:22.201,GUARD: Open on 40!
00:03:32.295,00:03:33.212,Close 40.
00:03:45.433,00:03:48.103,"Haywire, you ever thought of breaking out?"
00:03:51.106,00:03:53.150,Not be here.
00:03:53.650,00:03:55.235,Halfway houses.
00:03:55.276,00:03:56.070,Psych visits. Meds.
00:04:00.323,00:04:01.241,Keeping a job.
00:04:04.161,00:04:05.328,Why you ask?
00:04:08.082,00:04:09.583,I didn't know what to say.
00:04:09.624,00:04:11.001,Tell Officer Bellick.
00:04:12.293,00:04:14.046,"He'll make life easy for you if, uh..."
00:04:20.052,00:04:21.136,If what?
00:04:24.347,00:04:25.599,What about them?
00:04:27.434,00:04:29.186,What are they of?
00:04:29.228,00:04:31.312,"No, no, no."
00:04:31.354,00:04:32.606,They're just tattoos.
00:04:39.113,00:04:43.408,They think I have schizoaffective disorder with bipolar tendencies.
00:04:43.450,00:04:44.076,They think you got it?
00:04:46.286,00:04:48.288,Whatever.
00:04:54.044,00:04:57.589,I take the pills to keep the quacks off my back.
00:05:04.221,00:05:06.265,Get out of the way.
00:05:14.148,00:05:18.068,"You know, maybe they give you those things for a reason."
00:05:18.110,00:05:19.236,Yeah.
00:05:19.278,00:05:20.612,To keep me dull.
00:05:22.114,00:05:24.324,To keep me in their invisible freaking handcuffs.
00:05:25.784,00:05:27.995,"Seriously, though, those tattoos, they're beautiful."
00:05:31.414,00:05:33.292,"I do, actually."
00:05:35.418,00:05:37.336,MAN: Door. Stand clear.
00:05:47.430,00:05:48.640,Sucre.
00:05:49.599,00:05:51.059,"I'm not even talking to you, man."
00:06:30.640,00:06:32.100,ABRUZZI: What's the problem?
00:06:32.976,00:06:34.019,Nothing I can't handle.
00:06:36.479,00:06:39.316,I could tell by looking at you from across the yard.
00:06:40.483,00:06:43.195,"Guys, didn't I say there was a problem?"
00:06:43.820,00:06:45.113,"So, what's the problem?"
00:06:46.281,00:06:47.406,You're looking at it.
00:06:49.034,00:06:51.078,"What, Haywire?"
00:06:51.119,00:06:52.871,He's my new cellmate.
00:06:54.497,00:06:56.457,That's a problem.
00:06:58.085,00:06:58.960,I don't.
00:06:59.002,00:07:02.047,"Hey, you and I are in bed now."
00:07:03.506,00:07:05.466,You made me a promise.
00:07:03.506,00:07:07.386,You said that we were gonna get out of here.
00:07:07.426,00:07:09.012,"You renege now, and I'm gonna cut you."
00:07:10.889,00:07:15.018,"So you better take care of your business, or I will take care of you."
00:07:16.770,00:07:18.063,Have a nice day.
00:08:06.194,00:08:08.196,"It's really coming together, isn't it?"
00:08:09.864,00:08:12.533,Yep.
00:08:12.575,00:08:20.000,"Well, I figure we still have the interior alcoves and pilasters to do, which is no small task."
00:08:20.041,00:08:21.042,I think so.
00:08:23.586,00:08:25.422,"Listen, I have to say, I..."
00:08:25.464,00:08:29.217,I really appreciate all the effort that you put into this. Uh...
00:08:35.390,00:08:37.392,There is one thing you could do for me.
00:08:39.186,00:08:40.395,My cellmate.
00:08:41.604,00:08:44.399,"Ah, the inimitable Charles Patoshik. Haywire."
00:08:44.441,00:08:45.817,Then you know.
00:08:45.859,00:08:47.777,Hold it right there.
00:08:50.613,00:08:52.740,You're gonna have to talk to him about that.
00:08:56.495,00:08:58.038,Did he threaten you?
00:09:01.791,00:09:11.551,"Unfortunately, unless there's some evidence of violence or sexual predation between cellmates, those kinds of requests fall on deaf ears around here."
00:09:12.635,00:09:16.556,The prison system's a little too crowded for requests based on personality.
00:09:17.557,00:09:19.518,It's not exactly Sandals out there.
00:09:25.648,00:09:26.107,Your wife is here.
00:09:26.149,00:09:28.026,What?
00:09:29.236,00:09:30.570,She's not supposed to be here till 4:00.
00:09:32.280,00:09:33.823,"Becky, do not let her come in here under any circumstances."
00:09:33.865,00:09:37.327,She's not supposed to see this until our anniversary.
00:09:37.369,00:09:38.578,I'll be right out.
00:09:45.960,00:09:47.628,"Hi, sweetheart."
00:09:47.670,00:09:48.796,You're early.
00:09:53.385,00:09:55.720,I am?
00:09:55.762,00:09:58.557,"Oh, just going over some files."
00:10:02.185,00:10:04.771,"This isn't Toledo all over again, is it?"
00:10:05.730,00:10:06.565,Toledo?
00:10:07.190,00:10:08.733,How can you say that?
00:10:09.692,00:10:10.651,Then you won't mind if I look.
00:10:10.693,00:10:11.945,"Uh, Judy..."
00:10:16.408,00:10:18.368,I'd get killed if I did.
00:10:19.702,00:10:21.246,Johnson's still deciding.
00:10:26.960,00:10:30.088,You should've just told me.
00:10:33.633,00:10:37.678,"Becky, have a guard escort Johnson back to his cell."
00:10:55.572,00:10:56.990,What are you doing here?
00:10:59.742,00:11:01.244,I'm representing you now.
00:11:01.995,00:11:03.204,Hmm.
00:11:04.038,00:11:05.832,If that's all right with you.
00:11:08.627,00:11:10.878,"Last time I saw you, you called me a liar."
00:11:10.920,00:11:12.671,Things have changed.
00:11:13.256,00:11:14.966,I believe you now.
00:11:33.318,00:11:35.654,She corroborated your story.
00:11:38.781,00:11:39.824,She's missing.
00:11:41.451,00:11:42.785,"I don't know, I think the Secret Service got to her."
00:11:42.827,00:11:45.079,Secret Service?
00:11:45.121,00:11:46.498,They've been poking around.
00:11:46.540,00:11:47.957,"As soon as they show up, she disappears."
00:11:47.999,00:11:49.209,What do you think happened?
00:11:49.250,00:11:50.544,Oh.
00:11:51.794,00:11:52.837,"I didn't realize it was that high up, you know."
00:11:55.798,00:11:57.758,Do you know what we're up against?
00:11:57.800,00:12:00.887,I know it's a lot more than either of us can handle on our own.
00:12:05.183,00:12:07.101,All they handle is death penalty cases.
00:12:08.811,00:12:10.146,I sent him copies of everything I had.
00:12:10.188,00:12:11.565,"I mean, you can go there, tell him what you found."
00:12:11.606,00:12:13.941,"Maybe, it'll be enough to bring them on board."
00:12:13.983,00:12:14.901,Okay.
00:12:19.822,00:12:20.907,"So, how's Sebastian?"
00:12:22.909,00:12:24.994,What do you mean?
00:12:26.204,00:12:30.749,"Well, you being here. I mean, is he cool with it?"
00:12:32.210,00:12:34.588,I haven't talked to him.
00:12:35.838,00:12:38.883,"The, um, engagement's off."
00:12:41.010,00:12:41.886,Oh.
00:12:42.761,00:12:42.887,Sorry.
00:12:44.889,00:12:47.601,You could at least say that like you mean it.
00:12:51.938,00:12:54.733,"God, you always were a lousy liar."
00:12:55.858,00:12:56.150,Hmm.
00:13:00.697,00:13:01.989,I'd better get to Project Justice.
00:13:12.875,00:13:12.875,Veronica.
00:13:17.880,00:13:19.006,Thank you.
00:13:20.007,00:13:21.842,I didn't have a whole lot left.
00:13:21.884,00:13:24.345,You can thank me when I get you out of here.
00:13:44.907,00:13:46.743,Hello? Are you there?
00:13:46.785,00:13:48.869,"Hey, if she is, she obviously don't want to talk to you."
00:13:50.913,00:13:51.830,"PRISONER: That dude right there, right there."
00:13:52.999,00:13:54.793,"It's Wednesday, babe."
00:13:54.833,00:13:56.169,"You're gonna come around today, right?"
00:13:57.712,00:13:58.879,"Look, I gotta hang up now."
00:13:58.921,00:14:01.924,"I gotta go back in the block, but you're gonna be here today, right?"
00:14:06.929,00:14:08.014,I do.
00:14:23.946,00:14:25.699,It's a pattern.
00:14:27.950,00:14:28.868,"Your tattoo, it's a pattern."
00:14:39.962,00:14:41.881,"Putting him in with Haywire is a low blow, Deputy."
00:14:41.922,00:14:44.925,What?
00:14:48.971,00:14:49.889,A kitten who murdered both his parents.
00:14:58.022,00:15:03.528,"Look, I know you got a soft spot for the guy because he's got brains in his head, and he's helping you with that contraption in there."
00:15:03.570,00:15:05.363,But the guy's a violent criminal.
00:15:07.990,00:15:12.453,You have been here long enough to know that I'm less interested in punishment than I am in rehabilitation.
00:15:12.495,00:15:16.457,And sticking him in with Haywire is not rehabilitation in my book.
00:15:16.499,00:15:18.959,"You delegated authority over Gen Pop to me, boss."
00:15:19.001,00:15:20.086,I know I did.
00:15:20.127,00:15:22.505,"Well, then you either gotta let me do my job or pass it on to somebody else."
00:15:22.547,00:15:24.799,"Now, Brad, go easy."
00:15:26.342,00:15:27.927,There's a reason I'm giving you more and more responsibility.
00:15:30.012,00:15:34.893,"When I retire, I'm recommending you to take my place."
00:15:34.934,00:15:37.771,Don't make me regret it.
00:15:41.982,00:15:43.693,I trust your judgment.
00:15:58.708,00:16:00.000,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait."
00:16:00.042,00:16:01.335,This is supposed to be an open visitation.
00:16:01.377,00:16:02.921,Why are we doing it here?
00:16:10.010,00:16:11.971,What are you doing here?
00:16:13.807,00:16:15.892,She's not gonna be coming around here anymore.
00:16:15.934,00:16:17.351,Is she hurt?
00:16:23.232,00:16:24.984,She's with me now.
00:16:27.904,00:16:28.947,"This is a joke, right?"
00:16:28.988,00:16:30.740,"No. She made a decision, man."
00:16:30.782,00:16:32.283,She decided she needed stability.
00:16:32.325,00:16:33.952,She's gonna get that from you?
00:16:36.078,00:16:36.996,"But, uh..."
00:16:38.080,00:16:39.874,I'm not the one who's in prison.
00:16:39.916,00:16:45.797,"See, I actually can do something for her."
00:16:47.256,00:16:49.634,"And she wanted me to stop by here and talk to you first, you know, in case you got mad..."
00:16:56.098,00:16:57.725,GUARD: We have a big problem.
00:16:59.101,00:17:01.020,You just proved my point.
00:17:02.939,00:17:03.982,You're a con.
00:17:05.692,00:17:07.318,And that's all you'll ever be.
00:17:26.963,00:17:28.047,Make it quick.
00:18:07.169,00:18:08.087,Scofield.
00:18:13.968,00:18:15.887,We need some fertilizer.
00:18:47.085,00:18:48.753,"Now, move."
00:19:08.272,00:19:10.149,"You know what, Haywire?"
00:19:11.233,00:19:13.319,I don't think we're going to work out.
00:19:15.696,00:19:19.117,"And since I was here first, I think you should go."
00:19:21.160,00:19:23.245,I crapped myself once in junior high.
00:19:25.247,00:19:34.507,"During--during PE, we were playing badminton, and I knew I was going to have to walk past a bunch of the other students to, you know, get back to the locker room."
00:19:39.846,00:19:43.599,"And I tried to make fun of it, you know, before anyone else did."
00:19:56.654,00:19:58.322,I just shared a secret with you.
00:20:00.282,00:20:02.493,You want to know what the tattoos mean?
00:20:02.535,00:20:03.369,Yeah.
00:20:03.410,00:20:05.329,"MAN: Go, gentlemen."
00:20:06.039,00:20:06.164,Move it.
00:20:12.294,00:20:14.213,Making any progress?
00:20:15.631,00:20:18.217,"With Sleeping Beauty back there, or with the digging?"
00:20:19.301,00:20:20.136,No.
00:20:22.055,00:20:23.430,But I know what to do.
00:20:24.140,00:20:25.432,"Oh, yeah?"
00:20:26.225,00:20:31.522,The problem is you don't got the stugots to do it.
00:20:36.402,00:20:38.112,"MAN: Abruzzi, let's go."
00:20:52.334,00:20:53.460,Yeah? Really?
00:20:53.502,00:20:55.880,"Well, tell the crazy son of a bitch I said hi."
00:20:57.297,00:20:59.299,She out of the hospital yet?
00:20:59.341,00:21:00.009,"Hold on, Ma."
00:21:00.051,00:21:02.095,Bite me.
00:21:04.304,00:21:06.891,"Okay, we got a problem now, man."
00:21:06.933,00:21:07.141,Let's handle it then.
00:21:10.310,00:21:11.896,Just what I thought.
00:21:21.363,00:21:22.990,"Maricruz? It's me. Baby, what the hell is going on?"
00:21:23.032,00:21:25.243,SUCRE: What's the deal with you and Hector?
00:21:25.284,00:21:26.786,When were you gonna tell me?
00:21:29.205,00:21:31.290,What?
00:21:31.331,00:21:32.416,Hector told me.
00:21:32.458,00:21:34.252,Hector told you.
00:21:34.293,00:21:37.171,Of course he told you.
00:21:37.213,00:21:38.589,Why would he lie?
00:21:38.631,00:21:42.218,"Because he's been trying to get into your pants since the minute we started dating, that's why."
00:21:43.469,00:21:44.053,You know what?
00:21:47.389,00:21:49.267,"Me, mami. Believe me."
00:21:49.308,00:21:51.644,"Yeah, while I wait by the phone twice a week."
00:21:52.603,00:21:54.021,"Baby, where is this coming from?"
00:21:58.317,00:22:00.027,"Look, there's just so many things."
00:22:10.412,00:22:11.538,You think your clock is ticking?
00:22:11.580,00:22:14.208,"Well, I am going to be 30 in a few years."
00:22:14.625,00:22:16.376,"Baby, you're 25."
00:22:16.418,00:22:18.629,"You want to get pregnant, let's get pregnant right now."
00:22:18.671,00:22:20.006,"Baby, you know I can't get pregnant till I marry you."
00:22:27.763,00:22:34.352,"Yeah, well, Hector says that if something goes wrong in there, that you could serve your full sentence."
00:22:36.314,00:22:37.064,I can't wait 10 years.
00:22:38.065,00:22:40.484,"I can't wait 10 years, baby."
00:22:41.443,00:22:44.404,I'm gonna be out in 16 months.
00:22:46.448,00:22:48.242,"Okay, well, what if something does happen, huh?"
00:22:48.284,00:22:50.577,"Baby, I can't wait that long."
00:22:53.289,00:22:54.915,I can't.
00:22:56.416,00:22:58.044,I'm sorry. I gotta go.
00:22:59.753,00:23:02.380,Hello? Wait. Hello?
00:23:02.422,00:23:03.381,Hel...
00:23:13.475,00:23:17.063,"BEN: Even if Leticia Barris turned up again, her testimony would be worthless."
00:23:17.104,00:23:20.274,"By and large, most junkies with criminal records don't shine on the stand."
00:23:21.984,00:23:23.485,Maybe.
00:23:28.490,00:23:33.037,"The Secret Service agent who came to visit you when Leticia was in your office, what did he want?"
00:23:41.212,00:23:43.089,Do you have any new evidence?
00:23:44.840,00:23:47.009,"That is effectively what you're telling us, right?"
00:23:47.051,00:23:48.468,I need to clarify here.
00:23:49.553,00:23:50.804,"Yes, that is what I'm telling you."
00:23:50.846,00:23:53.473,"But look, Mr. Forsik, you don't need to point out what I don't have."
00:23:53.515,00:23:54.934,I am well aware of that.
00:23:54.975,00:24:01.357,I'm here asking for your help because I don't think an innocent man should be killed for something he didn't do.
00:24:04.526,00:24:06.946,We get thousands of requests for representation.
00:24:06.987,00:24:08.948,I'm sure you do...
00:24:06.987,00:24:11.909,And I have to decide which cases we're going to devote our very limited resources to.
00:24:14.536,00:24:19.041,"But since I don't have any experience in death penalty cases, I'm just asking you to point me in the right direction."
00:24:24.504,00:24:25.423,Please.
00:24:26.506,00:24:27.800,I'm sorry.
00:24:27.841,00:24:30.552,We just don't have the manpower.
00:24:37.601,00:24:39.477,Thank you for your time.
00:24:51.824,00:24:52.950,She's just leaving now.
00:24:58.372,00:25:01.000,We're not going to need nearly that much time.
00:25:06.964,00:25:09.591,I've turned up quite a bit already.
00:25:17.850,00:25:20.518,"Hey, have you seen my toothpaste?"
00:25:21.145,00:25:22.562,It was right here.
00:25:22.604,00:25:23.981,Haven't seen it.
00:25:24.398,00:25:26.192,I always put it in the same place.
00:25:26.817,00:25:28.526,I'm sure it'll turn up.
00:25:30.946,00:25:32.990,GUARD: Lights out in 10 minutes.
00:26:10.236,00:26:12.446,"The tattoos, there's a maze."
00:26:13.072,00:26:14.156,Get away from me.
00:26:14.198,00:26:16.200,I need to see them.
00:26:16.242,00:26:17.617,You gotta show them to me.
00:26:17.659,00:26:19.912,It's pulling me in.
00:26:27.127,00:26:28.128,Okay.
00:26:29.004,00:26:31.006,He's got a maze on his skin.
00:26:33.633,00:26:35.761,The man's got a maze on his skin.
00:26:39.432,00:26:40.140,Why?
00:26:48.606,00:26:49.733,I don't know. Ow!
00:27:02.996,00:27:04.957,MAN ON P.A.: All inmates in the yard.
00:27:06.624,00:27:08.085,All inmates in the yard.
00:27:10.963,00:27:14.550,How are your contacts in Chemical Lockup?
00:27:15.717,00:27:17.719,I need a bottle of Drain Line Root Control.
00:27:17.761,00:27:19.513,Sooner than later.
00:27:23.725,00:27:23.767,Just one.
00:27:28.897,00:27:30.149,WESTON: You the one who's looking for me?
00:27:30.190,00:27:33.860,"Yeah, I wanted to ask you some questions about the Lincoln Burrows case."
00:27:33.902,00:27:35.779,Yeah?
00:27:35.821,00:27:38.073,I'm representing Lincoln on his appeal.
00:27:38.115,00:27:39.699,What about it?
00:27:39.741,00:27:44.622,"You were the first one to respond to Lincoln's apartment the night of the murder, right?"
00:27:44.662,00:27:47.749,"Look, I'd really appreciate it if you could just tell me exactly what you saw."
00:27:49.460,00:27:53.213,Dispatch called in with a tip that Burrows was seen running from the garage where they found Terrence Steadman.
00:27:55.382,00:27:57.884,We spread out.
00:27:57.926,00:27:59.970,That's where I saw your client washing out the bloody pants.
00:28:00.012,00:28:02.389,WESTON: Police! Hands up!
00:28:04.808,00:28:10.314,"In the report that you typed up that night, you said that you saw Lincoln standing in the bathroom."
00:28:10.356,00:28:13.775,"Later, you testified that you saw him washing the pants."
00:28:13.817,00:28:15.361,Does it matter?
00:28:16.778,00:28:17.863,Did you actually see him washing the pants or not?
00:28:17.904,00:28:19.114,Yes.
00:28:25.204,00:28:27.080,Your testimony factored into his conviction.
00:28:45.891,00:28:47.726,Miss Donovan.
00:28:47.767,00:28:48.686,Huh.
00:28:48.727,00:28:50.437,I--I didn't mean to scare you.
00:28:52.814,00:28:53.773,Nick Savrinn with--with Project Justice.
00:28:53.815,00:28:56.943,"I know who you are, but what are you doing here?"
00:28:56.985,00:29:02.658,"Look, my boss may not think Lincoln's case is worth looking into, but I do."
00:29:19.717,00:29:22.595,ABRUZZI: There's a quicker way to take care of the problem.
00:30:16.940,00:30:20.986,What stood out for me was that most death penalty cases take 10 years to exhaust all appeals.
00:30:23.905,00:30:28.368,"So for it to be expedited, there had to have been some sort of political influence, right?"
00:30:35.125,00:30:37.294,It doesn't take a judge.
00:30:44.926,00:30:47.513,"If he was set up, then why?"
00:30:48.930,00:30:49.848,I think the answer to that might lie in the victim.
00:30:54.812,00:30:56.772,That he was pushing alternative energy.
00:30:56.814,00:30:58.315,Successfully pushing alternative energy.
00:30:58.357,00:31:05.864,"So oil companies, the Saudis, even our own government, a lot of people stood to benefit with Steadman out of the picture."
00:31:07.949,00:31:09.909,Why did you wait till now to take up this case?
00:31:09.951,00:31:12.871,"I thought he did it, like everybody else."
00:31:13.955,00:31:16.583,I just hope it's not too late.
00:31:17.125,00:31:18.335,It very well may be.
00:31:18.377,00:31:20.754,You need to prepare yourself for that.
00:31:25.967,00:31:27.803,Why death penalty work?
00:31:29.095,00:31:32.932,My father did 15 years for a crime he didn't commit.
00:31:32.974,00:31:37.771,I know firsthand that when the government gets you in their crosshairs you stand very little chance.
00:31:38.146,00:31:39.356,That's why.
00:31:43.694,00:31:45.696,"Now, do you want my help?"
00:32:13.766,00:32:14.974,They're digging machines.
00:32:13.766,00:32:16.643,You want to go to China?
00:32:16.685,00:32:18.978,I'll dig like a psychotic rodent if I have to.
00:32:23.525,00:32:24.902,Van Gogh over there's my new cellmate.
00:32:26.319,00:32:27.821,You're gonna get rid of him.
00:32:33.326,00:32:34.620,"So, how you gonna do it?"
00:32:34.661,00:32:35.995,"Well, let's just put it this way."
00:32:36.037,00:32:38.081,Someone's going to get hurt.
00:32:47.340,00:32:49.134,"WOMAN: How did we miss this, guys?"
00:32:49.175,00:32:52.053,Scofield's father was out of the picture by the time he was born.
00:32:52.095,00:32:53.096,He took his mother's maiden name.
00:32:57.058,00:32:58.852,KELLERMAN: Correct.
00:33:09.070,00:33:11.657,"Obviously, something's up."
00:33:14.993,00:33:16.912,It may just be a coincidence.
00:33:16.954,00:33:19.581,Move on the younger brother.
00:33:20.081,00:33:24.169,"Do it preemptively before anything rises up, bites any of us in the ass."
00:33:25.337,00:33:27.213,"GUARD: All right, let's move it along!"
00:33:27.255,00:33:28.465,Let's look alive!
00:33:40.101,00:33:42.020,Where does it lead?
00:33:44.857,00:33:45.899,Where are you taking me?
00:33:53.072,00:33:56.075,"What are you, nuts?"
00:33:57.118,00:33:59.037,I need an officer!
00:33:59.078,00:34:00.038,Shut up!
00:34:00.079,00:34:02.290,What the hell's the problem down here?
00:34:04.292,00:34:04.960,Open up on 40.
00:34:09.130,00:34:11.090,"Back off, Haywire."
00:34:11.132,00:34:13.092,"No, look."
00:34:16.137,00:34:17.681,"I'm telling you, look at..."
00:34:18.139,00:34:19.140,Back off!
00:34:20.141,00:34:21.434,Let's go!
00:34:22.561,00:34:25.104,Get him out of here!
00:34:25.146,00:34:27.482,It's a pathway to hell!
00:34:27.524,00:34:30.068,He's taking us all to hell!
00:34:51.130,00:34:52.966,"Well, ain't that swell?"
00:35:08.106,00:35:10.650,"Good to be back, man."
00:35:46.227,00:35:48.063,"Good afternoon, Mr. Scofield."
00:35:48.105,00:35:49.188,MICHAEL: Hello.
00:35:50.065,00:35:51.942,How you feeling today?
00:35:52.525,00:35:53.151,Pretty good.
00:35:55.904,00:35:56.071,What happened?
00:36:02.243,00:36:03.161,Uh-huh.
00:36:07.499,00:36:08.917,By all means.
00:36:17.926,00:36:21.596,"You know you're going to get killed in here, right, if you're not careful?"
00:36:23.932,00:36:25.142,I'll make you a bet.
00:36:26.267,00:36:31.106,"When I get out of here alive, I'll take you to dinner."
00:36:33.733,00:36:35.234,Lunch. Cup of coffee.
00:36:35.276,00:36:43.201,"Michael, this um, this charm act could be exactly what's getting you into trouble out in the yard."
00:36:48.289,00:36:49.833,Lean forward.
00:37:01.302,00:37:03.346,"All right, so you went to the parking garage."
00:37:03.388,00:37:05.891,Terrence Steadman is already dead.
00:37:06.307,00:37:07.559,That's right.
00:37:07.600,00:37:09.019,"You saw that, and you ran."
00:37:09.061,00:37:10.979,Dumped the gun.
00:37:11.021,00:37:12.271,Where?
00:37:12.313,00:37:13.815,Van Buren and Wells.
00:37:15.942,00:37:17.152,What do you do after that?
00:37:18.070,00:37:18.153,You go back to your apartment?
00:37:19.320,00:37:20.155,Yeah.
00:37:23.200,00:37:26.036,"I was freaking out, trying to figure out what had happened."
00:37:33.001,00:37:35.879,"The cops, they busted in a minute after I got there."
00:37:35.921,00:37:38.673,"The pants, the ones with Steadman's blood on them."
00:37:42.343,00:37:45.638,He's lying. My hands were wet after splashing water on my face.
00:37:49.517,00:37:51.144,I never touched those pants.
00:37:52.062,00:37:53.438,Which brings us back to the gun.
00:37:58.359,00:37:59.611,Ballistics matched it to a slug that was...
00:37:59.652,00:38:01.404,"The gun was planted, it was planted."
00:38:03.322,00:38:05.658,Your fingerprints were all over the gun.
00:38:09.412,00:38:10.622,Bo.
00:38:15.127,00:38:16.335,Who's Bo?
00:38:16.377,00:38:18.130,He's the guy who arranged everything.
00:38:20.048,00:38:25.011,"Had me come around the night before, tried a few guns, see which one felt right."
00:38:25.053,00:38:26.763,And that was the setup right there.
00:38:26.805,00:38:28.389,One of those must've been the murder weapon.
00:38:28.431,00:38:30.850,Then that's how they got my fingerprints on the gun.
00:38:33.394,00:38:39.234,"NICK: All right, so this--this Bo, uh, he coerces you into doing this, all to clear a $90,000 debt?"
00:38:41.194,00:38:42.862,He was gonna kill my son.
00:38:44.030,00:38:45.615,Well?
00:38:45.657,00:38:47.784,"A lot of I didn't do its, and those don't count for much."
00:38:47.826,00:38:52.205,"The security tape, the one that shows Lincoln pulling the trigger, you've got it, right?"
00:38:52.247,00:38:54.373,"If Lincoln's telling the truth, then that tape is lying."
00:38:54.415,00:38:56.876,I think we should have a look.
00:39:04.425,00:39:05.760,You're clear.
00:39:28.033,00:39:31.077,It's only when the chemicals are combined that they become a corrosive.
00:39:32.912,00:39:35.207,Not in school.
00:39:51.472,00:39:56.728,"But what you're doing up there in the infirmary, what has that got to do with what we're doing here?"
00:40:03.026,00:40:07.030,The infirmary's the closest building to those walls.
00:40:12.827,00:40:14.996,And the weakest link in the security chain.
00:40:15.038,00:40:17.207,Cool.
00:40:23.462,00:40:25.965,I think I've removed enough grout to bust through.
00:40:27.175,00:40:29.427,I'm going to need you to make some noise.
00:40:40.521,00:40:42.065,Is that the best you can do?
00:40:43.733,00:40:46.194,"Have some faith, papi, have some faith."
00:40:49.989,00:40:51.449,INMATE: Shut up!
00:41:36.494,00:41:37.996,Not one more word!
00:41:38.037,00:41:42.459,Next inmate that opens his mouth goes in the hole!
00:42:25.960,00:42:26.961,You okay?
00:42:29.964,00:42:31.924,Work.
00:42:33.343,00:42:34.593,It's fine.
00:42:36.846,00:42:39.015,I got it.
00:42:42.977,00:42:45.021,Everything all right?
00:42:46.356,00:42:49.150,Do you want to come in?
00:42:55.365,00:42:56.574,Problem solved.
00:42:57.325,00:42:58.326,What's this?
00:43:09.837,00:43:11.839,Have a good night.
