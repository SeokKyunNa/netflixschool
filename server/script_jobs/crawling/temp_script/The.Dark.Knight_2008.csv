00:01:49.509,00:01:51.878,CHUCKLES: Six shares. Don't forget the guy who planned the job.
00:01:52.212,00:01:54.447,GRUMPY: He thinks he can sit it out and still take a slice.
00:01:54.581,00:01:57.684,-I know why they call him the Joker. HAPPY: Why do they call him the Joker?
00:01:57.817,00:01:59.686,DOPEY: I heard he wears makeup. HAPPY: Makeup?
00:01:59.819,00:02:01.788,"DOPEY: Yeah, to scare people. You know, war paint."
00:02:14.434,00:02:17.604,"GRUMPY: All right, everybody, hands up, heads down!"
00:02:17.904,00:02:20.740,"I said, hands up, heads down!"
00:02:20.874,00:02:23.843,"Let's go, pal, I'm making a withdrawal here."
00:02:24.244,00:02:25.612,"-I said, hands up! -No!"
00:02:25.912,00:02:28.314,DOPEY: Here comes the silent alarm.
00:02:28.448,00:02:29.716,And there it goes.
00:02:29.849,00:02:31.217,GRUMPY: Heads down!
00:02:31.351,00:02:33.620,"All right, tootsie, you're taking a dive with me."
00:02:33.753,00:02:36.489,"-Down! I said, stay down there! WOMAN: Don't hurt me!"
00:02:36.689,00:02:39.692,"DOPEY: Funny, it didn't dial 911. It was trying to reach a private number."
00:02:39.826,00:02:41.761,"HAPPY: Is it a problem? DOPEY: No, I'm done here."
00:02:51.271,00:02:53.573,GRUMPY: Sit down! Down!
00:02:54.173,00:02:56.309,"Down! I said, stay down there!"
00:03:00.513,00:03:03.383,GRUMPY: Obviously we don't want you doing anything with your hands...
00:03:03.516,00:03:06.452,...other than holding on for dear life.
00:03:14.260,00:03:16.262,CHUCKLES: On the ground! Stay on the ground!
00:03:16.396,00:03:19.933,Nobody make a move! Nobody! Stay down!
00:03:36.482,00:03:37.517,Yeah!
00:03:40.386,00:03:42.455,You have any idea who you're stealing from?
00:03:42.589,00:03:46.359,"-You and your friends are dead. GRUMPY: He's out, right?"
00:03:49.429,00:03:50.630,GRUMPY: What--?
00:03:58.504,00:04:00.306,Where did you learn to count?
00:04:02.942,00:04:06.512,HAPPY: They wired this thing up with like 5000 volts. What kind of bank does that?
00:04:06.646,00:04:09.682,GRUMPY: A Mob bank. I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.
00:04:09.816,00:04:10.850,Where's the alarm guy?
00:04:10.984,00:04:13.586,"HAPPY: Boss told me when the guy was done, I should take him out."
00:04:13.720,00:04:14.988,"One less share, right?"
00:04:15.922,00:04:18.324,"GRUMPY: Funny, he told me something similar."
00:04:18.458,00:04:19.826,HAPPY: He what? No! No!
00:04:31.604,00:04:32.905,GRUMPY: That's a lot of money.
00:04:33.039,00:04:36.809,"If this Joker guy was so smart, he'd have had us bring a bigger car."
00:04:38.344,00:04:42.282,I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me soon as we loaded the cash.
00:04:43.016,00:04:46.853,"BOZO: No, no, no, I kill the bus driver."
00:04:47.620,00:04:48.721,GRUMPY: Bus driver?
00:04:50.890,00:04:52.492,What bus driver?
00:04:56.562,00:04:58.498,DRIVER: School's out. Time to go.
00:04:58.631,00:05:00.833,"That guy's not getting up, is he?"
00:05:01.634,00:05:03.369,That's a lot of money.
00:05:06.773,00:05:09.042,What happened to the rest of the guys?
00:05:15.848,00:05:18.351,"MANAGER: You think you're smart, huh?"
00:05:18.918,00:05:20.620,The guy that hired youse...
00:05:21.054,00:05:23.723,...he'll just do the same to you.
00:05:23.956,00:05:26.926,"Oh, criminals in this town used to believe in things."
00:05:27.060,00:05:28.494,Honor...
00:05:28.628,00:05:30.396,...respect.
00:05:30.530,00:05:32.799,"Look at you. What do you believe in, huh?"
00:05:32.932,00:05:34.367,What do you believe in?!
00:05:34.634,00:05:39.572,I believe whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you...
00:05:41.040,00:05:42.675,...stranger.
00:06:24.650,00:06:27.587,"MAN 1: Mr. Mayor, you were elected in a campaign to clean up the city."
00:06:27.720,00:06:29.856,-When are you gonna start? MAN 2: I already have.
00:06:29.989,00:06:33.860,"MAN 1: Like this Batman. We're hearing he's doing good, criminals are running scared."
00:06:33.993,00:06:37.764,"-No, man. I don't like it tonight. -What are you, superstitious?"
00:06:37.897,00:06:40.967,You got more chance of winning the Powerball than running into him.
00:06:41.100,00:06:44.604,That's not true. Our men in the Major Crimes Unit are close to an arrest.
00:06:44.737,00:06:47.707,"Hey, Wuertz, mayor says you're closing in on the Batman."
00:06:47.840,00:06:49.942,The investigation is ongoing.
00:06:50.076,00:06:52.612,MAYOR: The process of cleaning up the streets is a long one.
00:06:52.745,00:06:54.747,"I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have...."
00:06:59.018,00:07:01.454,"Ever intending to see your wife again, lieutenant?"
00:07:01.587,00:07:04.123,"I thought you had to go look after your mother, detective."
00:07:04.457,00:07:06.425,Checked her back into the hospital.
00:07:06.793,00:07:08.494,I'm sorry.
00:07:08.895,00:07:12.131,-So he hasn't shown up? -He often doesn't.
00:07:12.632,00:07:15.768,-I like reminding everybody he's out there. -Why wouldn't he come?
00:07:16.035,00:07:17.904,Hopefully...
00:07:18.504,00:07:19.939,...because he's busy.
00:07:36.722,00:07:39.659,That's why we bring dogs.
00:07:39.792,00:07:42.061,-My little princes. MAN: Please.
00:07:42.195,00:07:45.865,"Please, they're crawling in my mouth. Please, I beg you, get them off."
00:07:45.998,00:07:48.801,CHECHEN: Look what your drugs do to my customers.
00:07:48.935,00:07:50.636,SCARECROW: Buyer beware.
00:07:50.770,00:07:53.940,I told you my compound would take you places.
00:07:54.073,00:07:56.876,I never said they'd be places you wanted to go.
00:07:57.009,00:07:59.645,"My business, repeat customers."
00:07:59.779,00:08:03.483,"SCARECROW: You don't like what I have to offer, you can buy from someone else."
00:08:03.616,00:08:06.219,Assuming Batman left anyone to buy from.
00:08:09.689,00:08:13.693,My dogs are hungry.
00:08:17.196,00:08:19.699,Pity there's only one of you.
00:08:27.673,00:08:29.208,CHECHEN: What--? SCARECROW: That's not him.
00:08:33.713,00:08:35.515,Loose the dogs!
00:08:48.094,00:08:49.729,SCARECROW: That's more like it.
00:10:17.817,00:10:19.619,Don't let me find you out here again.
00:10:19.752,00:10:22.622,-We're trying to help you. BATMAN: I don't need help.
00:10:22.755,00:10:24.023,Not my diagnosis.
00:10:24.156,00:10:27.827,What gives you the right? What's the difference between you and me?
00:10:27.960,00:10:30.863,I'm not wearing hockey pads.
00:10:34.266,00:10:36.235,OFFICER: Everybody back now!
00:10:38.371,00:10:41.707,He can't resist showing us his face.
00:10:45.911,00:10:48.047,GORDON: What's he hiding under that makeup?
00:10:55.821,00:10:58.357,"RAMIREZ: Uh, can we get a minute, people, please?"
00:11:01.060,00:11:03.195,Him again. Who are the others?
00:11:03.329,00:11:04.997,Another bunch of smalltimers.
00:11:06.265,00:11:08.067,BATMAN: Some of the marked bills I gave you.
00:11:08.200,00:11:10.436,My detectives have been making drug buys with them.
00:11:10.770,00:11:13.239,This bank was another drop for the Mob. That makes five.
00:11:13.372,00:11:16.042,-We found the bulk of their dirty cash. -Time to move in.
00:11:16.175,00:11:20.012,"We'd have to hit all banks simultaneously. SWAT teams, backup."
00:11:20.279,00:11:22.014,What about this Joker guy?
00:11:22.148,00:11:25.117,One man or the entire Mob? He can wait.
00:11:25.251,00:11:27.720,"When the new DA hears about this, he'll want in."
00:11:27.853,00:11:30.289,-Do you trust him? -Be hard to keep him out.
00:11:30.423,00:11:33.993,I hear he's as stubborn as you are.
00:12:17.436,00:12:20.406,ALFRED: Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt.
00:12:20.739,00:12:23.309,You can swap not sleeping in a penthouse...
00:12:23.442,00:12:25.077,...for not sleeping in a mansion.
00:12:25.211,00:12:29.014,"Whenever you stitch yourself up, you do make a bloody mess."
00:12:29.148,00:12:32.151,Yeah. It makes me learn from my mistakes.
00:12:32.284,00:12:35.821,"You ought to be pretty knowledgeable by now, then."
00:12:37.389,00:12:38.424,My armor.
00:12:38.757,00:12:42.228,I'm carrying too much weight. I need to be-- I need to be faster.
00:12:42.361,00:12:45.097,I'm sure Mr. Fox can oblige.
00:12:45.231,00:12:47.833,-Did you get mauled by a tiger? -It was a dog.
00:12:47.967,00:12:50.402,-Huh? -It was a big dog.
00:12:50.536,00:12:54.440,"There were more copycats last night, Alfred, with guns."
00:12:54.773,00:12:56.509,"Why not hire them, take the weekend off?"
00:12:56.842,00:12:59.512,That wasn't exactly what I had in mind...
00:12:59.845,00:13:03.516,-...when I said I wanted to inspire people. -I know.
00:13:03.849,00:13:05.251,But things have improved.
00:13:05.417,00:13:07.987,Look at the new district attorney.
00:13:08.521,00:13:10.523,"BRUCE: I am, closely."
00:13:10.856,00:13:12.791,Need to know if he can be trusted.
00:13:12.925,00:13:16.962,Are you interested in his character or his social circle?
00:13:20.833,00:13:23.135,Who Rachel spends her time with is her business.
00:13:24.970,00:13:27.173,I trust you don't have me followed on my day off.
00:13:27.306,00:13:29.375,"If you ever took one, I might."
00:13:31.243,00:13:33.145,"Know your limits, Master Wayne."
00:13:33.279,00:13:36.382,Batman has no limits.
00:13:36.515,00:13:39.552,"-Well, you do, sir. -Well, can't afford to know them."
00:13:39.885,00:13:42.288,And what's gonna happen on the day that you find out?
00:13:42.421,00:13:45.191,We all know how much you like to say I told you so.
00:13:45.324,00:13:48.594,"On that day, Master Wayne, even I won't want to."
00:13:48.928,00:13:50.296,Probably.
00:13:57.169,00:13:58.904,"MAN: Sorry I'm late, folks."
00:14:02.841,00:14:05.010,-Where were you? -Worried you'd have to step up?
00:14:05.144,00:14:08.147,"-Harvey, I know these briefs backwards. -Well, then..."
00:14:08.280,00:14:10.282,...fair's fair.
00:14:10.416,00:14:12.451,"Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours."
00:14:12.585,00:14:14.853,Yeah? You wanna flip a coin to see who leads?
00:14:14.987,00:14:18.324,"My father's lucky coin. As I recall, it got me my first date with you."
00:14:18.457,00:14:21.594,I wouldn't leave something like that up to chance.
00:14:22.061,00:14:25.130,I don't. I make my own luck.
00:14:26.532,00:14:30.569,BAILIFF: All rise. The Honorable Judge Freel presiding.
00:14:30.903,00:14:33.439,I thought the DA just played golf with the mayor.
00:14:33.572,00:14:37.343,"Teeoff's 1:30. More than enough time to put you away for life, Sally."
00:14:37.476,00:14:39.111,With Carmine Falcone in Arkham...
00:14:39.245,00:14:42.248,...someone must have stepped up to run the so-called family.
00:14:43.148,00:14:45.351,Is that man in this courtroom today?
00:14:46.986,00:14:50.489,"-Could you identify him for us, please? -You win, counselor."
00:14:52.958,00:14:54.360,It was me.
00:14:56.128,00:14:59.965,I have a sworn statement from you that this man...
00:15:00.099,00:15:03.669,"...Salvatore Maroni, is the new head of the Falcone crime family."
00:15:04.003,00:15:08.107,Maroni? He's a fall guy. I'm the brains of the organization.
00:15:09.408,00:15:11.644,JUDGE: Order. -Permission to treat the witness as hostile?
00:15:11.977,00:15:13.545,-Granted. -Hostile? I'll show you hostile!
00:15:19.919,00:15:22.521,"Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in China."
00:15:22.655,00:15:26.592,"If you wanna kill a public servant, Mr. Maroni, I recommend you buy American."
00:15:27.526,00:15:30.229,"JUDGE: Get him out of here. -But, Your Honor, I'm not done."
00:15:33.999,00:15:37.236,"We'll never be able to link the gun to Maroni, so we can't charge him."
00:15:37.369,00:15:40.205,"But they're trying to kill you, means we're getting to them."
00:15:40.339,00:15:43.442,"I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel. I'm fine, by the way."
00:15:43.575,00:15:45.344,"Come on, Harvey. You're Gotham's DA."
00:15:45.477,00:15:48.347,"You're not getting shot at, you're not doing your job right."
00:15:48.480,00:15:49.648,"But, you know..."
00:15:49.982,00:15:53.252,"...if you said you were rattled, we could take the rest of the day off."
00:15:53.385,00:15:56.322,Can't. I dragged the head of the Major Crimes Unit down here.
00:15:56.455,00:16:01.260,"Oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually. Try to be nice."
00:16:10.302,00:16:13.138,I hear you got a hell of a right cross.
00:16:16.375,00:16:18.477,It's a shame Sal's going to walk.
00:16:18.610,00:16:22.648,"Yeah, well, good thing about the Mob is they keep giving you second chances."
00:16:27.987,00:16:30.255,Lightly irradiated bills.
00:16:30.622,00:16:33.058,Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?
00:16:33.425,00:16:37.129,"We liaise with various agencies-- Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him."
00:16:37.262,00:16:40.733,Official policy is to arrest the vigilante known as Batman on sight.
00:16:41.066,00:16:43.202,Mm-hm. What about that floodlight on the top of MCU?
00:16:43.335,00:16:45.671,If you got problems with malfunctioning equipment...
00:16:46.005,00:16:49.174,"...I suggest you take them up with Maintenance, counselor."
00:16:49.408,00:16:52.044,I've put every money launderer in Gotham behind bars...
00:16:52.177,00:16:54.480,...but the Mob is still getting its money out.
00:16:54.613,00:16:58.183,I think you and your friend have found the last game in town.
00:16:58.317,00:17:01.086,"You're trying to hit them where it hurts, their wallets."
00:17:01.220,00:17:02.354,It's bold.
00:17:03.389,00:17:04.423,You gonna count me in?
00:17:05.057,00:17:08.360,"In this town, the fewer people know something, the safer the operation."
00:17:08.494,00:17:10.696,I don't like that you got your own special unit...
00:17:11.030,00:17:13.766,...and it's full of cops I investigated at Internal Affairs.
00:17:14.099,00:17:16.769,If I didn't work with cops you'd investigated while at IA...
00:17:17.102,00:17:18.303,...I'd be working alone.
00:17:19.104,00:17:23.509,I don't get political points for being an idealist. I do the best I can with what I have.
00:17:27.179,00:17:30.783,You want me to back warrants for search and seizure on five banks...
00:17:31.116,00:17:32.785,...without telling me what we're after.
00:17:34.053,00:17:36.522,I can give you the names of the banks.
00:17:36.655,00:17:38.590,"Well, that's a start."
00:17:39.091,00:17:41.360,"I'll get you your warrants, but I want your trust."
00:17:41.493,00:17:45.364,"Oh, you don't have to sell me, Dent. We all know you're Gotham's white knight."
00:17:46.565,00:17:50.135,"Yeah, well, I heard they have a different name for me down at MCU."
00:17:50.602,00:17:52.071,I wouldn't know about that.
00:17:53.172,00:17:56.809,"MAN: In China, Lau Security Investments stands for dynamic new growth."
00:17:57.142,00:18:01.380,A joint Chinese venture with Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.
00:18:01.513,00:18:03.449,"FOX: Well, Mr. Lau..."
00:18:03.749,00:18:06.552,...I speak for the rest of the board...
00:18:07.219,00:18:10.155,"...and Mr. Wayne, in expressing our own excitement."
00:18:14.860,00:18:18.564,"Sir, I know Mr. Wayne is curious about how his trust fund gets replenished..."
00:18:18.697,00:18:21.300,"...but, frankly, this is embarrassing."
00:18:21.433,00:18:24.103,"You worry about the diligence, Mr. Reese."
00:18:24.236,00:18:26.472,I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.
00:18:26.605,00:18:28.240,It's done.
00:18:28.373,00:18:30.175,The numbers are solid.
00:18:30.309,00:18:31.743,Do them again.
00:18:31.877,00:18:35.147,"Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out, now, would we?"
00:18:37.716,00:18:39.418,FOX: Another long night?
00:18:39.551,00:18:42.521,"This joint venture was your idea, and the consultants love it."
00:18:43.255,00:18:44.456,But I'm not convinced.
00:18:44.590,00:18:48.327,Lau's company has grown by 8 percent annually like clockwork.
00:18:48.460,00:18:50.796,His revenue stream must be off the books...
00:18:51.130,00:18:52.464,...maybe even illegal.
00:18:52.598,00:18:54.333,Okay. Cancel the deal.
00:18:55.601,00:18:56.735,You already knew.
00:18:57.503,00:19:00.139,Just needed a closer look at their books.
00:19:00.272,00:19:02.307,Anything else you can trouble me for?
00:19:02.674,00:19:04.309,I need a new suit.
00:19:04.443,00:19:06.845,"Yeah. Three buttons is a little '90s, Mr. Wayne."
00:19:07.179,00:19:10.282,"I'm not talking fashion, Mr. Fox, so much as function."
00:19:11.316,00:19:12.885,You wanna be able to turn your head.
00:19:13.218,00:19:15.287,Sure make backing out of the driveway easier.
00:19:15.654,00:19:17.289,I'll see what I can do.
00:19:21.894,00:19:23.862,Took three weeks to get a reservation here.
00:19:24.196,00:19:26.298,I had to tell them I work for the government.
00:19:26.431,00:19:29.168,-Really? -Health inspector's not afraid to pull strings.
00:19:29.301,00:19:31.470,Rachel. Fancy that.
00:19:31.603,00:19:34.206,"Yeah, Bruce. Fancy that."
00:19:34.473,00:19:36.608,"Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel."
00:19:36.742,00:19:42.247,-Natascha. Are you the prima--? -Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.
00:19:42.381,00:19:45.651,-Wow. Harvey's taking me next week. -Really? So you're into ballet?
00:19:45.918,00:19:48.253,Bruce. This is Harvey Dent.
00:19:48.520,00:19:52.324,The famous Bruce Wayne. Rachel's told me everything about you.
00:19:52.457,00:19:53.625,I certainly hope not.
00:19:53.892,00:19:57.362,-Let's put a couple tables together. -I'm not sure that they'll let us.
00:19:57.496,00:20:00.532,"Oh, they should. I own the place."
00:20:00.899,00:20:03.869,How could you want to raise children in a city like this?
00:20:04.203,00:20:07.773,"-Well, I was raised here. I turned out okay. -Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?"
00:20:07.906,00:20:09.508,Is--? Heh-heh.
00:20:09.641,00:20:11.276,The Palisades? Sure.
00:20:11.410,00:20:15.781,"You know, as our new DA, you might wanna figure out where your jurisdiction ends."
00:20:15.914,00:20:19.885,I'm talking about the kind of city that idolizes a masked vigilante.
00:20:20.219,00:20:23.522,Gotham City is proud of an ordinary citizen standing up for what's right.
00:20:23.655,00:20:25.857,"Gotham needs heroes like you, elected officials..."
00:20:25.991,00:20:29.428,-...not a man who thinks he's above the law. -Who appointed the Batman?
00:20:29.561,00:20:33.432,We did. All of us who stood by and let scum take control of our city.
00:20:33.565,00:20:35.367,"NATASCHA: But this is a democracy, Harvey."
00:20:35.500,00:20:37.302,DENT: When their enemies were at the gates...
00:20:37.436,00:20:41.006,...the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city.
00:20:41.340,00:20:43.809,"It wasn't considered an honor, it was a public service."
00:20:43.942,00:20:48.247,"Harvey, the last man that they appointed to protect the republic was named Caesar..."
00:20:48.380,00:20:51.717,"-...and he never gave up his power. -Okay, fine."
00:20:51.850,00:20:53.318,You either die a hero...
00:20:53.452,00:20:56.488,...or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
00:20:56.622,00:21:00.025,"Whoever the Batman is, he doesn't wanna do this for the rest of his life."
00:21:00.359,00:21:03.562,How could he? Batman is looking for someone to take up his mantle.
00:21:03.695,00:21:05.931,"NATASCHA: Someone like you, Mr. Dent?"
00:21:06.498,00:21:08.867,Maybe. If I'm up to it.
00:21:09.001,00:21:14.406,What if Harvey Dent is the Caped Crusader? Hm?
00:21:16.608,00:21:19.745,"If I were sneaking out every night, someone would've noticed by now."
00:21:22.047,00:21:26.351,"Well, I'm sold, Dent, and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser."
00:21:26.485,00:21:29.354,"That's nice, but I'm not up for reelection for three years."
00:21:29.488,00:21:31.423,"No, you don't understand."
00:21:31.556,00:21:34.393,One fundraiser with my pals...
00:21:34.893,00:21:37.029,...you'll never need another cent.
00:21:51.777,00:21:53.879,What the hell is this?
00:21:55.347,00:21:58.450,"As you're all aware, one of our deposits was stolen."
00:21:58.583,00:22:01.887,"A relatively small amount, 68 million."
00:22:02.020,00:22:04.656,Who's stupid enough to steal from us?
00:22:04.923,00:22:08.560,"Two-bit wackjob, wears a cheap purple suit and makeup."
00:22:08.694,00:22:10.662,He's not the problem. He's a nobody.
00:22:10.796,00:22:14.099,The problem is our money being tracked by the cops.
00:22:14.433,00:22:16.835,Thanks to Mr. Maroni's well-placed sources...
00:22:16.968,00:22:20.806,...we know that police have indeed identified our banks using marked bills...
00:22:20.939,00:22:23.542,...and are planning to seize your funds today.
00:22:23.675,00:22:27.679,And since the enthusiastic new DA has put all my competitors out of business...
00:22:28.380,00:22:31.783,"-...I'm your only option. MARONI: So, what are you proposing?"
00:22:31.917,00:22:35.654,"LAU: Moving all deposits to one secure location, not a bank."
00:22:35.787,00:22:37.756,"-Where, then? -No one can know but me."
00:22:38.557,00:22:41.359,If the police were to gain leverage over one of you...
00:22:41.493,00:22:43.128,...everyone's money would be at stake.
00:22:43.462,00:22:45.564,What stop them getting to you?
00:22:45.697,00:22:48.767,"I go to Hong Kong, far from Dent's jurisdiction..."
00:22:49.067,00:22:51.970,...and the Chinese will not extradite one of their own.
00:22:52.104,00:22:53.805,MARONI: How soon can you move the money?
00:22:54.039,00:22:55.107,LAU: I already have.
00:22:57.609,00:23:00.112,"For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait for your permission."
00:23:00.812,00:23:04.549,"Rest assured, your money is safe."
00:23:11.690,00:23:16.695,"Oh, hee-hee, aha. Ha, ooh, hee, ha-ha, ha-ha."
00:23:16.828,00:23:19.030,And I thought my jokes were bad.
00:23:19.164,00:23:22.434,Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my boy pull your head off.
00:23:22.567,00:23:23.802,How about a magic trick?
00:23:27.072,00:23:29.541,I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.
00:23:31.777,00:23:32.878,Ta-da!
00:23:33.011,00:23:36.982,It's-- It's gone.
00:23:37.482,00:23:39.751,"Oh, and by the way, the suit, it wasn't cheap."
00:23:39.885,00:23:42.754,"-You ought to know, you bought it. CHECHEN: Sit."
00:23:43.822,00:23:46.858,I want to hear proposition.
00:23:49.628,00:23:52.030,JOKER: Let's wind the clocks back a year.
00:23:52.497,00:23:58.036,These cops and lawyers wouldn't dare cross any of you.
00:23:59.171,00:24:01.473,"I mean, what happened?"
00:24:01.606,00:24:05.443,Did your balls drop off? Hm?
00:24:05.577,00:24:07.612,"You see, a guy like me...."
00:24:07.979,00:24:10.782,-A freak. MOBSTER 1: Damn right.
00:24:10.916,00:24:14.019,"A guy like me-- Look, listen."
00:24:14.653,00:24:18.890,"I know why you choose to have your little, ahem..."
00:24:19.024,00:24:21.793,...group-therapy sessions in broad daylight.
00:24:22.194,00:24:25.030,I know why you're afraid to go out at night.
00:24:27.199,00:24:28.934,The Batman.
00:24:29.067,00:24:34.472,"See, Batman has shown Gotham your true colors, unfortunately."
00:24:34.606,00:24:38.009,"Dent, he's just the beginning."
00:24:38.677,00:24:43.481,And as for the television's so-called plan...
00:24:43.849,00:24:45.750,...Batman has no jurisdiction.
00:24:45.884,00:24:48.553,He'll find him and make him squeal.
00:24:48.687,00:24:51.690,I know the squealers when I see them...
00:24:51.823,00:24:53.558,...and....
00:24:54.159,00:24:55.760,CHECHEN: What do you propose?
00:24:55.894,00:24:58.230,"It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman."
00:24:59.698,00:25:02.667,"If it's so simple, why haven't you done it already?"
00:25:02.801,00:25:05.570,"If you're good at something, never do it for free."
00:25:06.104,00:25:07.539,How much you want?
00:25:08.106,00:25:10.108,"Uh, half."
00:25:12.277,00:25:15.080,"GAMBOL: You're crazy. -No, I'm not."
00:25:15.213,00:25:17.515,"No, I'm not."
00:25:18.984,00:25:22.520,If we don't deal with this now...
00:25:22.654,00:25:24.155,...soon...
00:25:24.522,00:25:29.261,...little Gambol here won't be able to get a nickel for his grandma.
00:25:29.995,00:25:31.563,Enough from the clown!
00:25:31.696,00:25:34.666,"Ah, ta-ta-ta. Let's not blow..."
00:25:34.799,00:25:37.235,MOBSTER 2: Shit! -...this out of proportion.
00:25:37.569,00:25:39.971,You think you can steal from us and just walk away?
00:25:40.105,00:25:41.740,-Yeah. GAMBOL: I'm putting the word out.
00:25:41.873,00:25:44.109,Five hundred grand for this clown dead.
00:25:44.242,00:25:47.279,"A million alive, so I can teach him some manners first."
00:25:48.713,00:25:51.182,"All right. So, listen, why don't you give me a call..."
00:25:51.316,00:25:55.120,...when you wanna start taking things a little more seriously?
00:25:55.253,00:25:57.155,Here's my card.
00:26:01.192,00:26:03.228,Mm-mm.
00:26:17.242,00:26:19.744,You're a hard man to reach.
00:26:22.747,00:26:24.983,Lau's halfway to Hong Kong.
00:26:26.217,00:26:29.087,"If you'd have asked, I could have taken his passport."
00:26:29.220,00:26:31.957,All that was left in the vaults were marked bills.
00:26:32.090,00:26:36.661,They knew we were coming. As soon as your office got involved-- My office?
00:26:36.795,00:26:43.802,"You're sitting down there with scum like Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking-- Oh, yeah. I almost had your rookie cold on a racketeering beat."
00:26:43.935,00:26:48.373,"Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly Maroni's got people in your office, Dent."
00:26:51.209,00:26:53.178,We need Lau back...
00:26:53.311,00:26:57.282,...but the Chinese won't extradite a national under any circumstances.
00:26:57.749,00:27:00.318,"If I get him to you, can you get him to talk?"
00:27:00.652,00:27:01.820,I'll get him to sing.
00:27:01.953,00:27:04.756,We're going after the Mob's life savings.
00:27:04.889,00:27:06.091,Things will get ugly.
00:27:06.224,00:27:08.660,"I knew the risk when I took this job, lieutenant."
00:27:08.793,00:27:10.228,"How will you get him back, any--?"
00:27:12.897,00:27:14.232,He does that.
00:27:14.366,00:27:17.969,Our Chinese friends left town before I could tell them the deal was off.
00:27:18.103,00:27:21.706,"Well, I'm sure that you've always wanted to go to Hong Kong."
00:27:21.840,00:27:23.975,What's wrong with a phone call?
00:27:24.109,00:27:27.812,I think Mr. Lau deserves a more personal touch.
00:27:28.980,00:27:33.818,"FOX: Now, for high-altitude jumps, you're going to need oxygen and stabilizers."
00:27:33.952,00:27:37.655,"Well, I must say, compared to your usual requests..."
00:27:37.789,00:27:40.258,...jumping out of an airplane is pretty straightforward.
00:27:40.959,00:27:43.061,BRUCE: What about getting back into the plane?
00:27:43.194,00:27:47.065,-I'd recommend a good travel agent. -Without it landing.
00:27:48.199,00:27:51.002,"Now, that's more like it, Mr. Wayne."
00:27:51.436,00:27:54.139,The CIA had a program back in the '60s...
00:27:54.272,00:27:57.742,...for getting their people out of hot spots called Sky Hook.
00:27:57.876,00:28:00.412,-We could look into that. -Yeah.
00:28:00.745,00:28:02.280,Okay. Now....
00:28:03.882,00:28:08.887,Hardened Kevlar plates over titanium-dipped tri-weave fibers for flexibility.
00:28:09.020,00:28:11.890,"You'll be lighter, faster, more agile."
00:28:15.293,00:28:17.429,Perhaps you should read the instructions first?
00:28:17.762,00:28:19.764,"-Yeah. -Now, there is a tradeoff."
00:28:19.898,00:28:23.301,Separation of the plates makes you more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.
00:28:23.435,00:28:26.404,"We wouldn't wanna make things too easy, now, would we?"
00:28:26.738,00:28:28.773,How will it hold up against dogs?
00:28:28.907,00:28:31.009,We talking rottweilers or Chihuahuas?
00:28:32.177,00:28:34.779,Should do fine against cats.
00:28:34.913,00:28:37.015,I found one in Arizona.
00:28:37.148,00:28:41.286,"A very nice man said he could have it up and running in a week, and he takes cash."
00:28:41.419,00:28:44.289,-What about the flight crew? -South Korean smugglers.
00:28:44.422,00:28:46.791,"They run flights into Pyongyang, below radar."
00:28:46.925,00:28:49.728,"-Did you think of an alibi? -Oh, yes."
00:29:08.346,00:29:11.049,"I believe this is your plane, sir."
00:29:15.220,00:29:18.823,"You look tired, Alfred. You'll be all right without me?"
00:29:20.358,00:29:23.962,If you can tell me the Russian for apply your own bloody suntan lotion.
00:29:35.073,00:29:38.943,"Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you. They say they've just killed the Joker."
00:29:39.077,00:29:40.945,BODYGUARD: They brought the body.
00:29:57.262,00:29:59.864,"So, dead, that's 500."
00:30:01.833,00:30:03.468,How about alive? Hm?
00:30:06.838,00:30:09.974,You wanna know how I got these scars?
00:30:11.910,00:30:14.913,My father was...
00:30:15.046,00:30:16.414,...a drinker...
00:30:16.548,00:30:17.949,...and a fiend.
00:30:18.817,00:30:22.954,"And one night, he goes off crazier than usual."
00:30:23.288,00:30:26.124,Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself.
00:30:26.257,00:30:27.892,He doesn't like that...
00:30:28.026,00:30:31.396,...not one bit.
00:30:31.529,00:30:34.165,"So, me watching..."
00:30:34.299,00:30:38.970,"...he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it."
00:30:39.103,00:30:46.044,He turns to me and he says: Why so serious?
00:30:46.244,00:30:47.912,He comes at me with the knife.
00:30:48.446,00:30:50.381,Why so serious?
00:30:52.584,00:30:55.486,He sticks the blade in my mouth.
00:30:55.954,00:30:59.891,Let's put a smile on that face.
00:31:01.059,00:31:03.228,And....
00:31:05.530,00:31:07.165,Why so serious?
00:31:12.203,00:31:13.605,Now...
00:31:13.938,00:31:16.140,...our operation is small...
00:31:16.274,00:31:19.210,...but there is a lot of potential...
00:31:19.344,00:31:21.980,...for aggressive expansion.
00:31:22.113,00:31:25.283,So which of you fine gentlemen would like to join our team?
00:31:25.416,00:31:29.954,"Oh. There's only one spot open right now, so we're gonna have..."
00:31:30.488,00:31:32.624,...tryouts.
00:31:37.295,00:31:39.297,Make it fast.
00:31:48.640,00:31:50.174,"MAN: Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox."
00:31:50.308,00:31:53.077,Mr. Lau regrets he is unable to greet you in person today.
00:31:53.211,00:31:55.146,FOX: I understand.
00:32:04.989,00:32:08.459,"For security purposes, I'm gonna have to ask you to check in your mobile."
00:32:08.593,00:32:10.261,Of course.
00:32:13.064,00:32:16.634,I must apologize for leaving Gotham in the middle of our negotiations.
00:32:16.968,00:32:20.405,This misunderstanding with the Gotham police force...
00:32:20.538,00:32:23.174,-...I couldn't let it threaten my company. -Of course.
00:32:23.308,00:32:26.444,A businessman of your stature will understand and...
00:32:26.577,00:32:30.548,"...with you here now, we can continue."
00:32:30.682,00:32:37.989,"Well, I do appreciate you bringing me out here in such style, Mr. Lau, but I re-- We do not allow cell phones in here."
00:32:38.122,00:32:40.692,I'm sorry. Forgot I had it.
00:32:41.025,00:32:45.530,"No, I really came to tell you that our business deal has to be put on hold."
00:32:46.164,00:32:49.233,"You see, we can't afford to be seen to do business with..."
00:32:50.335,00:32:52.303,...whatever it is you're accused of being.
00:32:52.437,00:32:55.106,I'm sure a businessman of your stature will understand.
00:32:55.239,00:32:59.177,"I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call might have sufficed."
00:32:59.310,00:33:02.613,Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think he was deliberately wasting your time.
00:33:02.747,00:33:04.449,Just accidentally wasting it.
00:33:05.450,00:33:09.587,"That's very good, Mr. Lau. Accidentally. Very good."
00:33:10.421,00:33:11.689,"Hey, sir."
00:33:30.074,00:33:32.076,There's a better view from the peak tram.
00:33:32.210,00:33:34.078,How's the view from LSI Holdings?
00:33:34.312,00:33:35.747,Restricted.
00:33:36.080,00:33:38.082,Lau is holed up in there good and tight.
00:33:38.216,00:33:40.151,-What's this? -I had R &amp; D work it up.
00:33:40.284,00:33:42.020,Sends out a high-frequency pulse...
00:33:42.153,00:33:45.023,...records the response time for mapping an environment.
00:33:45.423,00:33:48.092,Sonar. Just like a....
00:33:48.226,00:33:50.361,"Submarine, Mr. Wayne. Like a submarine."
00:33:50.762,00:33:52.630,-And the other device? -It's in place.
00:33:53.564,00:33:54.599,Mr. Wayne?
00:33:55.767,00:33:57.201,Good luck.
00:37:46.998,00:37:50.368,"RACHEL: Look, give us the money and we'll talk about making a deal."
00:37:50.501,00:37:53.738,The money is the only reason I'm still alive.
00:37:53.871,00:37:57.975,"Oh, you mean, when they find out that you've helped us, they're gonna kill you?"
00:37:58.309,00:37:59.877,-Are you threatening my client? -No.
00:38:00.011,00:38:04.382,I'm just assuming your client's cooperation with this investigation.
00:38:05.883,00:38:07.618,As will everyone.
00:38:08.886,00:38:12.356,No? Okay.
00:38:12.723,00:38:15.726,"Enjoy your time in County, Mr. Lau."
00:38:15.860,00:38:17.461,LAU: Wait!
00:38:17.628,00:38:19.630,I won't give you the money...
00:38:19.764,00:38:22.767,"...but I will give you my clients, all of them."
00:38:23.000,00:38:25.369,You were a glorified accountant.
00:38:25.503,00:38:29.373,What could you possibly have on all of them that we could charge?
00:38:29.507,00:38:33.377,I'm good with calculation. I handled all their investments.
00:38:33.511,00:38:34.979,One big pot.
00:38:36.480,00:38:37.748,Got it.
00:38:38.082,00:38:39.950,One minute.
00:38:40.785,00:38:45.523,"RICO. If they pooled their money, we can charge them as one criminal conspiracy."
00:38:45.656,00:38:46.791,Charge them with what?
00:38:46.924,00:38:52.630,"In a RICO case, if you can charge one of them with a felony-- You can charge all of them with it. That's great."
00:38:53.931,00:38:55.866,Mr. Lau.
00:38:56.867,00:39:00.871,What kind of details do you have about this communal fund?
00:39:01.005,00:39:02.707,"-Ledgers--? -Immunity, protection..."
00:39:02.840,00:39:06.410,-...a chartered plane back to Hong Kong. -After you testify in open court.
00:39:06.544,00:39:08.813,I'm just curious. With all your clients locked up...
00:39:09.080,00:39:11.449,...what's gonna happen with all that money?
00:39:11.582,00:39:14.685,"Like I said, I'm good with calculation."
00:39:14.819,00:39:19.557,He can't go to County. I'll keep him here in the holding cells.
00:39:19.690,00:39:22.126,"What is this, Gordon, your fortress?"
00:39:22.560,00:39:25.096,"Well, you trust them over at County?"
00:39:25.429,00:39:27.098,I don't trust them here.
00:39:28.899,00:39:30.501,Lau stays.
00:39:30.868,00:39:35.506,"Well, I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel arrangements, but I'm sure glad he's back."
00:39:35.639,00:39:38.008,Put word out. We hire the clown.
00:39:40.845,00:39:44.715,He was right. We have to fix real problem.
00:39:45.116,00:39:46.417,Batman.
00:39:50.855,00:39:54.792,-I'm not aware of any participation.... -Our boy looks good on the tube.
00:39:55.393,00:39:57.995,You sure you wanna embarrass me in front of my friends?
00:39:58.129,00:40:01.866,"Oh, don't worry. They're coming too."
00:40:08.739,00:40:10.608,STEPHENS: Have a nice trip. See you next fall.
00:40:10.741,00:40:12.610,WOMAN: Seven hundred twelve counts of extortion.
00:40:12.743,00:40:15.079,Eight hundred and forty-nine counts of racketeering.
00:40:15.413,00:40:20.851,Two hundred and forty-six counts of fraud. Eighty-seven counts of conspiracy murder.
00:40:21.786,00:40:24.889,Five hundred and twenty-seven counts of obstruction of justice.
00:40:25.423,00:40:26.724,How do the defendants plead?
00:40:33.864,00:40:34.899,Order in the court.
00:40:35.032,00:40:37.635,MAYOR: Five hundred and forty-nine criminals at once.
00:40:37.768,00:40:40.171,How did you convince Surrillo to hear this farce?
00:40:40.504,00:40:44.608,"She shares my enthusiasm for justice. After all, she is a judge."
00:40:44.742,00:40:47.778,Even if you blow enough smoke to get convictions out of Surrillo...
00:40:47.912,00:40:50.581,...you're gonna set a new record at appeals.
00:40:50.714,00:40:53.117,"It won't matter. The head guys make bail, sure."
00:40:53.451,00:40:55.786,"But the midlevel guys, they can't."
00:40:55.920,00:41:00.024,They can't afford to be off the streets. They'll cut deals that include some jail time.
00:41:00.157,00:41:03.160,Think of all you could do with 18 months of clean streets.
00:41:04.795,00:41:07.898,"LOEB: Mr. Mayor, you can't-- -No, get out. Both of you."
00:41:12.036,00:41:13.671,Sit down.
00:41:18.642,00:41:21.645,The public likes you. That's the only reason that this might fly.
00:41:21.779,00:41:23.047,But that means it's on you.
00:41:23.180,00:41:26.217,"They're all gonna come after you now, and not just the Mob."
00:41:26.550,00:41:30.221,"Politicians, journalists, cops."
00:41:30.554,00:41:32.957,Anyone whose wallet's about to get lighter.
00:41:33.090,00:41:35.826,Are you up to it? You'd better be.
00:41:35.960,00:41:38.062,Because they get anything on you...
00:41:38.195,00:41:43.033,"...and those criminals are back on the streets, followed swiftly by you and me."
00:41:43.167,00:41:44.602,Jesus!
00:42:05.723,00:42:08.092,"ALFRED: I think your fundraiser will be a great success, sir."
00:42:08.225,00:42:10.961,BRUCE: And why do you think I wanna hold a party for Harvey Dent?
00:42:11.095,00:42:14.164,I assumed it was your usual reason for socializing beyond myself...
00:42:14.298,00:42:18.302,...and the scum of Gotham's underbelly: To try to impress Miss Dawes.
00:42:18.636,00:42:22.706,"Very droll, but very wrong. Actually, it's Dent."
00:42:25.876,00:42:28.579,"Sensitive viewers, be aware. The image is disturbing."
00:42:28.712,00:42:30.881,JOKER: Tell them your name.
00:42:31.015,00:42:32.750,Brian Douglas.
00:42:34.218,00:42:36.687,JOKER: And are you the real Batman?
00:42:36.820,00:42:37.855,BRIAN: No. JOKER: No?
00:42:37.988,00:42:39.957,-No. -No?
00:42:40.090,00:42:41.859,Then why do you dress up like him?
00:42:43.294,00:42:44.295,Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
00:42:44.628,00:42:48.732,BRIAN: Because he's a symbol that we don't have to be afraid of scum like you.
00:42:48.866,00:42:52.136,"Yeah. You do, Brian. You really do."
00:42:52.269,00:42:55.973,"Huh? Yeah. Oh, shh, shh, shh."
00:42:56.106,00:43:00.678,So you think Batman's made Gotham a better place? Hm?
00:43:00.844,00:43:02.279,Look at me.
00:43:02.613,00:43:04.848,Look at me!
00:43:08.652,00:43:12.056,"You see, this is how crazy Batman's made Gotham."
00:43:12.189,00:43:14.625,You want order in Gotham...
00:43:14.892,00:43:19.229,...Batman must take off his mask and turn himself in.
00:43:19.363,00:43:23.200,"Oh, and every day he doesn't, people will die."
00:43:23.667,00:43:25.769,Starting tonight.
00:43:26.103,00:43:28.272,I'm a man of my word.
00:43:45.689,00:43:48.359,"Harvey Dent, scourge of the underworld..."
00:43:48.692,00:43:51.762,...scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade.
00:43:51.895,00:43:53.097,-I'll be back. -Rachel.
00:43:53.230,00:43:56.100,"A little liquid courage, Mr. Dent?"
00:43:56.233,00:43:58.769,"-Thank you. Alfred, right? -That's right, sir."
00:43:58.902,00:44:02.139,Rachel talks about you all the time. You've known her her whole life.
00:44:02.272,00:44:03.674,"Not yet, sir."
00:44:05.909,00:44:08.112,Any psychotic ex-boyfriends I should be aware of?
00:44:08.245,00:44:10.648,"Oh, you have no idea."
00:44:29.400,00:44:33.370,BRUCE: I'm sorry that I'm late. I'm glad to see that you all got started without me.
00:44:33.704,00:44:37.274,"Now, where is Harvey? Where--?"
00:44:37.408,00:44:39.943,"Harvey Dent, the man of the hour."
00:44:40.077,00:44:41.345,Where's Rachel Dawes?
00:44:41.679,00:44:43.981,She is my oldest friend. Come here.
00:44:44.114,00:44:50.721,"When Rachel first told me she was dating Harvey Dent, I had one thing to say: The guy from those God-awful campaign commercials?"
00:44:50.854,00:44:54.725,"I believe in Harvey Dent. Yeah, nice slogan, Harvey."
00:44:54.858,00:44:56.860,But it caught Rachel's attention.
00:44:56.994,00:44:59.997,And then I started to pay attention to Harvey...
00:45:00.330,00:45:03.767,...and all that he's been doing as our new DA.
00:45:03.901,00:45:05.736,And you know what?
00:45:07.771,00:45:09.173,I believe in Harvey Dent.
00:45:09.306,00:45:12.976,"I believe that on his watch, Gotham can feel..."
00:45:13.110,00:45:16.847,"...a little safer, a little more optimistic."
00:45:18.182,00:45:22.453,Look at this face. This is the face of Gotham's bright future.
00:45:22.786,00:45:24.922,To Harvey Dent. Let's hear it for him.
00:45:25.222,00:45:26.857,MAN: Harvey.
00:45:36.266,00:45:39.937,Harvey may not know you well enough to understand you're making fun of him...
00:45:40.070,00:45:42.072,"-...but I do. -No, I meant every word."
00:45:43.340,00:45:46.276,You know that day that you once told me about...
00:45:46.410,00:45:48.479,...when Gotham would no longer need Batman?
00:45:48.812,00:45:50.747,-It's coming. -Bruce.
00:45:51.415,00:45:57.087,-You can't ask me to wait for that. -It's happening now. Harvey is that hero.
00:45:57.221,00:46:01.792,"He locked up half of the city's criminals, and he did it without wearing a mask."
00:46:01.925,00:46:04.094,Gotham needs a hero with a face.
00:46:04.962,00:46:07.197,"DENT: You can throw a party, Wayne, I'll give you that."
00:46:08.499,00:46:10.434,Thanks again.
00:46:11.268,00:46:13.036,You mind if I borrow Rachel?
00:46:16.406,00:46:20.844,"Lieutenant, that joker card pinned to the body? Forensics found three sets of DNA."
00:46:20.978,00:46:22.312,-Any matches? -All three.
00:46:22.446,00:46:26.049,"The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo, Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb."
00:46:26.183,00:46:28.185,The Joker's telling us who he's targeting.
00:46:28.318,00:46:31.221,Get a unit over to Surrillo's house. Tell Wuertz to find Dent.
00:46:31.355,00:46:33.390,Protective custody. Where's the commissioner?
00:46:33.524,00:46:35.125,-City hall. -Seal the building.
00:46:35.259,00:46:37.261,-No one in or out till I get there. -Got it.
00:46:49.506,00:46:52.009,Gordon. What are you up to?
00:46:52.142,00:46:55.345,We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor search of the entire building.
00:46:55.479,00:46:58.148,We believe the Joker's made a threat against your life.
00:46:58.282,00:46:59.816,These are dangerous people.
00:46:59.950,00:47:03.854,-You're not giving me a lot of information. -Even we don't know where you're going.
00:47:03.987,00:47:07.257,"Take the envelope, get in, open it. It'll tell you where you're headed."
00:47:11.128,00:47:13.063,You can't leave me alone with these people.
00:47:13.197,00:47:16.233,The whole Mob's after you and you're worried about these guys?
00:47:16.366,00:47:18.335,"Compared to this, the Mob doesn't scare me."
00:47:18.468,00:47:22.139,"Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this for yourself, so..."
00:47:22.272,00:47:26.343,"...take my word, the police commissioner earns a lot of threats."
00:47:26.476,00:47:32.115,I found the appropriate response to these situations a long time ago.
00:47:32.282,00:47:34.484,Them gunning for you makes you see things clearly.
00:47:34.618,00:47:36.086,"Yeah, I bet."
00:47:36.220,00:47:40.457,Yeah. It makes you think about things you couldn't stand losing...
00:47:40.591,00:47:42.593,...about who you wanna spend your life with.
00:47:42.926,00:47:45.929,-That's a pretty big commitment. -Not if the Mob has their way.
00:47:51.101,00:47:53.870,You get to explain to my wife...
00:47:54.605,00:47:56.273,...why I'm late for dinner.
00:47:56.406,00:47:59.543,"Sir, the joker card had traces of your DNA on it."
00:48:01.211,00:48:03.914,-Don't do that. -All right.
00:48:04.348,00:48:07.284,"-Let's be serious, then. -Okay."
00:48:07.551,00:48:08.585,What's your answer?
00:48:14.925,00:48:16.326,I don't have an answer.
00:48:18.462,00:48:19.496,How'd they get my DNA?
00:48:19.630,00:48:21.965,Somebody with access to your office or house...
00:48:22.099,00:48:24.601,...must have lifted a tissue or a glass-- Wait! Wait!
00:48:24.935,00:48:27.671,"-Well, I guess no answer is a no. -Harvey."
00:48:28.005,00:48:30.107,"-It's someone else, isn't it? -Harvey."
00:48:30.240,00:48:35.345,Just tell me it's not Wayne. The guy's a complete f-- What are you doing?
00:48:46.523,00:48:47.524,"GORDON: Oh, shit."
00:48:53.664,00:48:55.465,GORDON: Get a medic!
00:48:59.002,00:49:00.103,They've come for him.
00:49:01.505,00:49:02.639,We made it.
00:49:05.309,00:49:06.343,Stay hidden.
00:49:08.545,00:49:12.015,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen."
00:49:14.951,00:49:18.689,We are tonight's entertainment.
00:49:19.556,00:49:25.629,I only have one question: Where is Harvey Dent?
00:49:35.205,00:49:37.274,You know where Harvey is? You know who he is?
00:49:37.407,00:49:38.642,"THUG: Hands up, pretty boy."
00:49:45.749,00:49:48.585,Do you know where I can find Harvey? I need to talk to him.
00:49:48.719,00:49:51.588,"Just something little, huh? No."
00:49:54.024,00:49:56.626,What's going on out there? Wayne!
00:49:58.195,00:50:03.266,"-Oh, thank God, you've got a panic room. MAN: Hey, wait-- Oh, you gotta be kidding me."
00:50:03.500,00:50:05.502,"You know, I'll settle for his loved ones."
00:50:05.635,00:50:09.239,We're not intimidated by thugs.
00:50:10.207,00:50:11.775,You know...
00:50:13.477,00:50:16.480,...you remind me of my father.
00:50:17.047,00:50:18.715,I hated my father.
00:50:19.049,00:50:21.084,"RACHEL: Okay, stop."
00:50:24.755,00:50:27.624,"Well, hello, beautiful."
00:50:29.760,00:50:33.630,You must be Harvey's squeeze. Hm?
00:50:34.131,00:50:36.533,And you are beautiful.
00:50:43.473,00:50:47.377,You look nervous. Is it the scars?
00:50:48.311,00:50:50.480,You wanna know how I got them?
00:50:51.648,00:50:54.284,Come here. Hey.
00:50:54.584,00:50:56.353,Look at me.
00:50:56.720,00:51:01.525,"So I had a wife. She was beautiful, like you..."
00:51:01.725,00:51:06.096,...who tells me I worry too much...
00:51:06.229,00:51:09.166,...who tells me I ought to smile more...
00:51:09.299,00:51:14.704,...who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. Hey.
00:51:15.238,00:51:17.574,One day they carve her face.
00:51:18.175,00:51:22.379,And we have no money for surgeries. She can't take it.
00:51:22.679,00:51:26.283,I just wanna see her smile again. Hm?
00:51:26.550,00:51:29.486,I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars.
00:51:30.120,00:51:31.555,So...
00:51:32.222,00:51:35.759,...I stick a razor in my mouth and do this...
00:51:36.326,00:51:37.627,...to myself.
00:51:37.861,00:51:43.133,And you know what? She can't stand the sight of me.
00:51:43.266,00:51:44.701,She leaves.
00:51:45.469,00:51:47.804,Now I see the funny side.
00:51:48.705,00:51:50.373,Now I'm always smiling.
00:51:53.710,00:51:57.180,You got a little fight in you. I like that.
00:51:57.314,00:51:58.582,BATMAN: Then you're gonna love me.
00:52:26.710,00:52:27.878,Drop the gun.
00:52:28.211,00:52:33.216,"Oh, sure. You just take off your little mask and show us all who you really are. Hm?"
00:52:38.722,00:52:39.890,Let her go.
00:52:40.724,00:52:42.259,Very poor choice of words.
00:53:04.915,00:53:06.816,Are you all right?
00:53:09.219,00:53:11.521,Let's not do that again.
00:53:11.755,00:53:14.357,-Is Harvey okay? -He's safe.
00:53:15.792,00:53:17.260,Thank you.
00:53:17.494,00:53:18.528,"Jim, it's over."
00:53:18.662,00:53:21.398,"As long as they don't get to Lau, we've cut off their funds."
00:53:21.531,00:53:24.568,The prosecution's over. Nobody's standing up in front of a judge...
00:53:24.701,00:53:27.904,...while judges and police commissioners are getting blown away.
00:53:28.238,00:53:32.876,"-What about Dent? -He's got any sense, Dent's halfway to Mex-- DENT: So where do you keep your trash?"
00:53:34.344,00:53:38.315,You're due in court. I need you alive long enough to get you on the record.
00:53:38.448,00:53:41.484,You can't protect me. You can't even protect yourselves.
00:53:41.618,00:53:44.888,"You refuse to cooperate, you're not coming back here, you go to County."
00:53:45.221,00:53:47.591,How long do you calculate you'll last in there?
00:53:48.925,00:53:52.529,Targeting me won't get their money. I knew the Mob wouldn't go down easily...
00:53:52.662,00:53:56.266,-...but this is different. They crossed a line. -You crossed the line first.
00:53:56.399,00:53:59.736,"You squeezed them, you hammered them to the point of desperation."
00:53:59.869,00:54:04.874,"And in their desperation, they turned to a man they didn't fully understand."
00:54:05.475,00:54:07.911,"Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred."
00:54:08.244,00:54:10.413,We just need to figure out what he's after.
00:54:10.547,00:54:11.881,"ALFRED: With respect, Master Wayne..."
00:54:12.015,00:54:14.985,...perhaps this is a man you don't fully understand either.
00:54:15.819,00:54:18.588,"A long time ago, I was in Burma..."
00:54:18.722,00:54:22.258,...and my friends and I were working for the local government.
00:54:22.392,00:54:24.861,They were trying to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders...
00:54:24.995,00:54:27.864,...by bribing them with precious stones...
00:54:27.998,00:54:32.669,...but their caravans were being raided in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.
00:54:32.802,00:54:36.039,So we went looking for the stones.
00:54:36.539,00:54:41.645,"But in six months, we never met anyone who traded with him."
00:54:42.345,00:54:46.349,"One day, I saw a child playing with a ruby..."
00:54:46.483,00:54:49.519,...the size of a tangerine.
00:54:49.719,00:54:53.023,The bandit had been throwing them away.
00:54:53.757,00:54:56.526,-So why steal them? -Because he thought it was good sport.
00:54:56.660,00:55:01.631,"Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money."
00:55:01.765,00:55:05.969,"They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with."
00:55:06.503,00:55:10.373,Some men just wanna watch the world burn.
00:55:30.727,00:55:31.861,"WOMAN: Your name, sir?"
00:55:31.995,00:55:35.331,JOKER: Eighth and Orchard. You'll find Harvey Dent there.
00:55:48.044,00:55:49.612,BATMAN: Check the names.
00:55:56.086,00:55:57.854,Richard Dent.
00:56:00.023,00:56:01.091,Patrick Harvey.
00:56:01.558,00:56:02.559,Harvey Dent.
00:56:02.692,00:56:05.695,I need 10 minutes with the scene before your men contaminate it.
00:56:05.862,00:56:09.799,-It's because of you these guys are dead-- -Detective!
00:56:11.968,00:56:14.003,"Give us a minute, guys."
00:56:15.371,00:56:16.840,That's brick underneath.
00:56:17.107,00:56:19.843,-Gonna take ballistics off a shattered bullet? -No.
00:56:22.045,00:56:23.980,Fingerprints.
00:56:32.622,00:56:34.557,"Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast."
00:56:36.392,00:56:40.964,Because we found his next target. He's put it in tomorrow's paper.
00:56:58.414,00:57:00.650,"I'm not sure you made it loud enough, sir."
00:57:13.696,00:57:15.832,"What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?"
00:57:15.965,00:57:19.803,You wanted me to do the diligence on the LSI Holdings deal again.
00:57:20.537,00:57:22.772,"Well, I found some irregularities."
00:57:23.106,00:57:25.175,Their CEO is in police custody.
00:57:25.508,00:57:28.445,"No, not with their numbers, with yours."
00:57:28.611,00:57:33.550,Applied Sciences. Whole division of Wayne Enterprises just disappeared overnight.
00:57:33.683,00:57:37.887,I went down to the archives and I started pulling some old files.
00:57:38.988,00:57:44.727,Don't tell me you didn't recognize your baby pancaking cop cars on the evening news.
00:57:44.961,00:57:48.131,Now you got the entire R &amp; D Department burning through cash...
00:57:48.465,00:57:51.734,...claiming it's related to cell phones for the Army?
00:57:51.868,00:57:54.938,"What are you building for him now, a rocket ship?"
00:57:56.840,00:57:58.641,I want...
00:57:58.775,00:58:02.712,...$10 million a year for the rest of my life.
00:58:05.114,00:58:07.217,Let me get this straight.
00:58:08.585,00:58:10.954,You think that your client...
00:58:11.087,00:58:15.959,"...one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world, is secretly a vigilante..."
00:58:16.092,00:58:20.830,...who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands...
00:58:20.964,00:58:24.100,...and your plan is to blackmail this person?
00:58:31.674,00:58:32.909,Good luck.
00:58:35.812,00:58:40.049,When-- Keep that.
00:58:46.789,00:58:49.158,FOX: This is your original scan.
00:58:50.693,00:58:52.929,Here it is reengineered.
00:59:01.104,00:59:04.741,And there's the thumbprint he left when he pushed the round in the clip.
00:59:06.743,00:59:07.877,I'll get you a copy.
00:59:08.044,00:59:11.881,"Mr. Wayne, did you reassign R &amp; D?"
00:59:12.015,00:59:14.617,Yeah. Government telecommunications project.
00:59:14.751,00:59:16.786,Wasn't aware we had any government contracts.
00:59:16.986,00:59:19.989,"You know, Lucius, I'm playing this one pretty close to the chest."
00:59:21.090,00:59:22.859,Fair enough.
00:59:25.795,00:59:28.898,"ENGEL: With no word from the Batman, even as they mourn Commissioner Loeb..."
00:59:29.032,00:59:32.335,...these cops have to wonder if the Joker will make good on his threat...
00:59:32.669,00:59:35.838,...in the obituary column of The Gotham Times to kill the mayor.
00:59:37.674,00:59:41.210,I've checked all the databases. There are four possibles.
00:59:41.344,00:59:43.646,Cross-reference the addresses.
00:59:43.780,00:59:47.784,"Look for Parkside, overlooking the parade."
00:59:48.952,00:59:50.053,I got one.
00:59:50.186,00:59:54.190,"Melvin White, 1502 Randolph Apartments."
00:59:54.691,00:59:58.761,"Aggravated assault, moved to Arkham twice."
01:00:37.834,01:00:39.302,What do you got on the roof?
01:00:39.636,01:00:43.072,"We're tight, but frankly, there's a lot of windows up here."
01:00:51.714,01:00:55.752,Commissioner Loeb dedicated his life to law enforcement...
01:00:55.885,01:00:58.121,...and to the protection of his community.
01:00:58.254,01:01:00.089,I remember when I first took office...
01:01:00.223,01:01:02.859,...and I asked if he wanted to stay on as commissioner.
01:01:02.992,01:01:08.197,"And he said he would, provided I kept my politics out of his office."
01:01:12.001,01:01:15.138,"Clearly he was not a man who minced words, nor should he have been."
01:01:16.272,01:01:19.876,A number of policies that he enacted as commissioner were unpopular.
01:01:20.009,01:01:23.212,Policies that flooded my office with angry calls and letters....
01:01:27.717,01:01:29.252,-Who's that? -What happened?
01:01:30.286,01:01:32.188,They took our guns.
01:01:32.321,01:01:34.157,And our uniforms.
01:01:40.830,01:01:43.433,MAYOR: And as we recognize the sacrifice of this man...
01:01:43.766,01:01:47.737,...we must remember that vigilance is the price of safety.
01:01:47.870,01:01:50.273,Stand by. Honor guard.
01:01:50.406,01:01:54.110,Attention. Port arms.
01:01:55.278,01:01:59.782,Ready! Aim! Fire!
01:02:00.416,01:02:02.051,Ready! Aim!
01:02:05.755,01:02:08.057,Ready! Aim!
01:02:16.399,01:02:17.934,OFFICER: Stay down! Don't move!
01:02:19.802,01:02:21.337,STEPHENS: Mr. Mayor. Get him out of here.
01:02:30.513,01:02:32.915,-I'll see you later. -Why are you going back?
01:02:45.428,01:02:46.462,Get out of here.
01:02:50.500,01:02:52.301,Tell me what you know about the Joker.
01:03:23.332,01:03:24.801,No.
01:03:25.134,01:03:26.402,"I'm sorry, Barbara."
01:03:27.336,01:03:30.540,"Jimmy, go play with your sister. Go ahead, honey."

01:03:36.479,01:03:38.414,Shh.
01:03:38.548,01:03:39.949,BARBARA: Are you out there?
01:03:41.217,01:03:45.822,Are you? You brought this craziness on us. You did!
01:03:45.955,01:03:48.257,You brought this on us!
01:03:49.292,01:03:53.963,"Switch it off, he ain't coming. He doesn't wanna talk to us."
01:03:54.297,01:03:57.300,God help whoever he does wanna talk to.
01:03:59.035,01:04:01.971,Can't we go someplace quieter? We can't hear each other talk.
01:04:02.104,01:04:04.974,What makes you think I wanna hear you talk?
01:04:05.107,01:04:06.142,What?
01:04:35.471,01:04:37.173,-Yeah? MAN: Second.
01:04:37.306,01:04:38.341,Okay.
01:04:38.474,01:04:40.610,"-Harvey, where are you? DENT: Where are you?"
01:04:40.943,01:04:44.614,"I'm where you should be, at Major Crimes. I'm trying to deal with all of this mess."
01:04:44.947,01:04:48.417,"-Can I get the fingerprint analysis? -Rachel, listen. You're not safe there."
01:04:48.551,01:04:50.386,-This is Gordon's unit. -Gordon's gone.
01:04:50.519,01:04:54.190,RACHEL: He vouched for these men. -And he's gone.
01:04:58.895,01:05:00.963,The Joker's named you next.
01:05:01.097,01:05:04.100,"God, is there someone, is there anyone in this town we can trust?"
01:05:04.233,01:05:06.002,Bruce.
01:05:06.235,01:05:07.370,We can trust Bruce Wayne.
01:05:07.503,01:05:11.173,"-No. Rachel, I know you're his friend, but-- -Harvey, trust me."
01:05:11.307,01:05:14.110,Bruce's penthouse is now the safest place in the city.
01:05:14.243,01:05:15.511,Then you go straight there.
01:05:15.645,01:05:17.947,Don't tell anybody and I'll find you there.
01:05:18.080,01:05:19.649,I love you.
01:05:33.663,01:05:35.064,I want the Joker.
01:05:36.232,01:05:37.967,From one professional to another...
01:05:38.100,01:05:40.536,"...you're trying to scare somebody, pick a better spot."
01:05:40.670,01:05:43.339,"From this height, the fall wouldn't kill me."
01:05:43.472,01:05:45.141,-I'm counting on it. -Huh!
01:05:52.448,01:05:55.551,-Where is he? -I don't know where he is. He found us.
01:05:55.685,01:05:57.119,He must have friends.
01:05:57.386,01:05:59.622,Friends? Have you met this guy?
01:05:59.956,01:06:01.424,Someone knows where he is.
01:06:01.557,01:06:04.160,Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.
01:06:04.293,01:06:05.561,They're wise to your act.
01:06:05.695,01:06:09.699,"You got rules. The Joker, he's got no rules."
01:06:10.032,01:06:14.737,"Nobody's gonna cross him for you. If you want this guy, you got one way."
01:06:15.071,01:06:16.706,But you already know what that is.
01:06:17.039,01:06:19.675,"Just take off that mask, let him come find you."
01:06:21.377,01:06:25.448,Or you can let a couple more people get killed while you make up your mind.
01:06:27.183,01:06:29.185,You wanna play games?
01:06:35.458,01:06:36.459,How's that feel?
01:06:36.592,01:06:39.295,-You wouldn't. -I wouldn't!
01:06:40.696,01:06:42.398,-You don't think I will? -Mm-mm.
01:06:42.531,01:06:44.567,-You don't think I will? -Mm-mm.
01:06:46.068,01:06:49.238,"No. No, I wouldn't."
01:06:50.406,01:06:53.042,That's why I'm not gonna leave it up to me.
01:06:54.043,01:06:57.046,"Heads, you get to keep your head."
01:06:57.380,01:06:59.081,Tails...
01:07:00.049,01:07:01.083,...not so lucky.
01:07:01.384,01:07:05.021,So you wanna tell me about the Joker?
01:07:14.330,01:07:18.100,"-Let's go again. -I don't know anything! God, don't!"
01:07:18.234,01:07:20.536,"You're not playing the odds, friend."
01:07:21.637,01:07:23.639,Let's do it again.
01:07:26.509,01:07:28.377,You'd leave a man's life to chance?
01:07:29.178,01:07:32.648,"-Not exactly. -His name's Schiff, Thomas."
01:07:32.782,01:07:35.785,"He's a paranoid schizophrenic, former patient at Arkham."
01:07:36.118,01:07:40.623,The kind of mind the Joker attracts. What do you expect to learn from him?
01:07:44.093,01:07:46.729,The Joker killed Gordon. He's gonna kill Rachel.
01:07:47.063,01:07:49.698,You're the symbol of hope I could never be.
01:07:49.832,01:07:51.700,Your stand against organized crime...
01:07:51.834,01:07:55.204,...is the first legitimate ray of light in Gotham in decades.
01:07:55.337,01:07:58.841,"If anyone saw this, everything would be undone."
01:07:59.175,01:08:01.410,The criminals you arrested would be released...
01:08:01.544,01:08:04.613,...and Jim Gordon will have died for nothing.
01:08:05.314,01:08:07.516,You're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow.
01:08:07.650,01:08:10.152,-Why? -No one else will die because of me.
01:08:10.286,01:08:12.555,Gotham's in your hands now.
01:08:12.688,01:08:14.457,You can't.
01:08:14.590,01:08:16.092,You can't give in.
01:08:16.325,01:08:18.761,You can't give in!
01:08:34.243,01:08:35.444,Harvey called.
01:08:35.578,01:08:38.614,He said Batman's gonna turn himself in.
01:08:38.747,01:08:39.849,I have no choice.
01:08:40.182,01:08:43.252,You honestly think that's gonna keep the Joker from killing people?
01:08:43.385,01:08:46.755,Maybe not. But I have enough blood on my hands.
01:08:47.323,01:08:52.194,And I've seen now what I would have to become to stop men like him.
01:08:52.628,01:08:56.198,You once told me that if the day came when I was finished...
01:08:56.332,01:08:58.400,...that we'd be together.
01:08:59.168,01:09:02.304,"Bruce, don't make me your one hope for a normal life."
01:09:03.739,01:09:05.207,Did you mean it?
01:09:06.609,01:09:08.477,Yes.
01:09:25.694,01:09:27.530,Bruce.
01:09:28.497,01:09:32.434,"If you turn yourself in, they're not gonna let us be together."
01:09:42.945,01:09:45.915,ALFRED: Logs as well? BRUCE: Everything.
01:09:46.248,01:09:49.552,Anything that could lead back to Lucius or Rachel.
01:09:54.823,01:09:58.260,"People are dying, Alfred. What would you have me do?"
01:09:58.394,01:10:02.198,"Endure, Master Wayne. Take it."
01:10:02.331,01:10:05.901,"They'll hate you for it, but that's the point of Batman."
01:10:06.235,01:10:11.674,He can be the outcast. He can make the choice that no one else can make.
01:10:11.807,01:10:13.275,The right choice.
01:10:13.676,01:10:16.712,"No, today I found out what Batman can't do."
01:10:16.845,01:10:18.247,He can't endure this.
01:10:18.480,01:10:21.383,Today you get to say I told you so.
01:10:21.850,01:10:24.987,"Today, I don't want to."
01:10:30.859,01:10:32.428,But I did bloody tell you.
01:10:35.464,01:10:38.467,ALFRED: I suppose they're gonna lock me up as well...
01:10:39.301,01:10:40.502,...as your accomplice.
01:10:40.636,01:10:45.441,BRUCE: Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.
01:10:49.645,01:10:53.282,"Ladies and gentlemen, I've called this press conference for two reasons."
01:10:53.415,01:10:55.451,"Firstly, to assure the citizens of Gotham..."
01:10:55.584,01:10:59.321,...that everything that can be done over the Joker killings is being done.
01:11:00.623,01:11:03.692,"Secondly, because the Batman has offered to turn himself in."
01:11:03.826,01:11:05.594,But let's consider the situation.
01:11:05.894,01:11:08.597,Should we give in to this terrorist's demands?
01:11:08.731,01:11:10.299,Do we really think he's gonna--?
01:11:10.432,01:11:13.736,You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante than the lives of citizens?
01:11:13.869,01:11:16.372,The Batman is an outlaw.
01:11:17.273,01:11:20.876,"That's not why we demand he turn himself in, we're doing it because we're scared."
01:11:21.010,01:11:23.846,We've been happy to let Batman clean up our streets till now.
01:11:23.979,01:11:26.949,MAN 1: Things are worse than ever! MAN 2: Amen.
01:11:28.417,01:11:30.352,"Yes, they are."
01:11:32.755,01:11:35.758,But the night is darkest just before the dawn.
01:11:38.327,01:11:40.396,And I promise you...
01:11:41.030,01:11:42.564,...the dawn is coming.
01:11:42.698,01:11:47.336,"One day, the Batman will have to answer for the laws he's broken. But to us..."
01:11:47.469,01:11:49.071,...not to this madman.
01:11:49.405,01:11:51.674,-No more dead cops! OFFICERS: Yeah!
01:11:54.910,01:11:56.578,He should turn himself in!
01:11:56.712,01:11:59.481,MAN 3: Give us the Batman! Come on! MAN 4: Where is he?
01:12:02.384,01:12:04.520,So be it. Take the Batman into custody.
01:12:04.887,01:12:06.855,WOMAN: What? MAN 5: Is he here?
01:12:07.656,01:12:08.657,I am the Batman.
01:12:08.924,01:12:11.927,MAN 6: What? MAN 7: Come on.
01:12:20.436,01:12:22.371,RACHEL: Alfred.
01:12:23.639,01:12:25.474,Why is he letting Harvey do this?
01:12:25.607,01:12:28.610,-He went down to the press conference. -I know. He just stood by.
01:12:28.744,01:12:30.813,Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent...
01:12:30.946,01:12:33.949,...believe that Batman stands for something more important...
01:12:34.083,01:12:36.552,"...than the whims of a terrorist, Miss Dawes..."
01:12:36.685,01:12:38.687,...even if everyone hates him for it.
01:12:38.821,01:12:40.923,That's the sacrifice he's making.
01:12:41.056,01:12:44.760,He's not being a hero. He's being something more.
01:12:45.394,01:12:46.895,"Yeah, you're absolutely right."
01:12:47.029,01:12:50.099,Letting Harvey take the fall for this is not heroic at all.
01:12:52.835,01:12:54.536,You know him better than anyone.
01:12:54.870,01:12:55.904,I do.
01:12:59.408,01:13:02.444,Will you give this to him for me? When the time is right?
01:13:03.812,01:13:04.980,How will I know?
01:13:05.114,01:13:06.715,It's not sealed.
01:13:08.050,01:13:09.685,"Goodbye, Alfred."
01:13:13.822,01:13:15.624,"Bye, Rachel."
01:13:23.532,01:13:25.434,I didn't have time to talk this through.
01:13:25.567,01:13:28.937,-What are you doing? -They're transferring me to Central Holding.
01:13:29.171,01:13:32.908,"This is the Joker's chance, and when he attacks, the Batman will take him down."
01:13:33.041,01:13:34.676,Listen. This is too dangerous.
01:13:34.810,01:13:38.580,"We get this guy to County, he's their problem. The streets will be cleared..."
01:13:38.714,01:13:42.484,...so let's go. The convoys stop for no reason.
01:13:42.618,01:13:43.986,"I hope you got some moves, pal."
01:13:44.119,01:13:48.457,He's using you as bait. He doesn't know if he can get the Joker. He's failed so far.
01:13:48.724,01:13:52.761,"-How do you know what he's thinking? -I just do. Anyway, this isn't just about you."
01:13:52.895,01:13:57.900,What about the people depending on you to clean the city up and do it honorably and--?
01:14:03.639,01:14:06.141,Harvey. Tell everyone the truth.
01:14:06.642,01:14:08.544,"Heads, I go through with it."
01:14:08.710,01:14:12.648,This is your life. You can't leave something like that to chance.
01:14:12.948,01:14:14.049,I'm not.
01:14:17.553,01:14:19.888,You make your own luck.
01:14:41.743,01:14:43.745,"Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal."
01:14:51.253,01:14:53.722,What the hell is that?
01:14:53.856,01:14:56.024,"Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!"
01:14:56.158,01:14:59.528,"Damn it! All units divert down onto Lower Fifth. I repeat, exit down."
01:14:59.862,01:15:00.963,Exit down!
01:15:01.096,01:15:03.565,Lower Fifth? We'll be like turkeys on Thanksgiving.
01:15:36.131,01:15:38.600,"Jesus. Come on, get us out of here. Let's go."
01:15:40.736,01:15:43.038,"Listen, we need backup. We've got company."
01:15:43.171,01:15:44.806,"We got trouble, guys."
01:15:47.743,01:15:48.810,Lock and load!
01:15:59.988,01:16:01.290,The hell was that?
01:16:23.178,01:16:25.914,"-These are built for that, right? -He'll need something..."
01:16:26.048,01:16:27.883,...a lot bigger to get through this.
01:16:28.917,01:16:30.285,What is that?
01:16:31.753,01:16:33.021,"What is that, a bazooka?"
01:16:41.730,01:16:43.298,I didn't sign up for this!
01:16:59.781,01:17:01.049,Look out.
01:17:01.883,01:17:03.018,Look out!
01:17:11.259,01:17:12.294,JOKER: Hmm.
01:17:25.240,01:17:26.341,"Come on, let's go!"
01:18:13.021,01:18:15.190,"Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent."
01:18:15.323,01:18:18.193,"Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive."
01:18:23.131,01:18:26.802,COMPUTER: Scanning all systems. Scanning all systems.
01:18:34.176,01:18:36.278,"We gotta get topside. We need air support, now!"
01:18:41.883,01:18:43.785,I like this job. I like it.
01:18:45.987,01:18:48.490,COMPUTER: Damage catastrophic. Eject sequence initiated.
01:19:02.471,01:19:04.072,Goodbye.
01:19:13.148,01:19:16.318,"We're on point, ready to give them some of their own medicine."
01:19:22.824,01:19:25.193,That's what I'm talking about. Air cav.
01:19:38.840,01:19:40.408,"Okay, rack them up."
01:19:40.542,01:19:43.044,"Rack them up, rack them up, rack them up."
01:20:08.837,01:20:09.971,That's not good.
01:20:13.375,01:20:14.543,"Okay, that's not good!"
01:20:57.853,01:20:59.921,"Now, there's a Batman."
01:21:04.159,01:21:05.327,"Ooh, you wanna play. Come on."
01:21:08.263,01:21:09.364,Come on.
01:21:18.473,01:21:19.875,He missed!
01:21:33.622,01:21:36.157,You can't stop here. We're like sitting ducks!
01:21:53.174,01:21:54.242,"Come on, come on."
01:21:57.345,01:22:00.649,"Come on. Come on. I want you to do it, I want you to do it. Come on!"
01:22:03.285,01:22:04.653,Come on.
01:22:05.387,01:22:08.657,"Come on. I want you to do it, I want you to do it. Come on, hit me."
01:22:08.990,01:22:10.492,"Come on, hit me. Come on, hit me!"
01:22:12.594,01:22:13.628,Hit me!
01:22:38.620,01:22:42.023,"Come on, come on. Aah!"
01:22:42.157,01:22:44.359,Could you please just give me a minute?
01:22:46.428,01:22:48.296,"We got you, you son of a bitch."
01:22:51.533,01:22:55.470,Gor-- You do like to play things pretty close to the chest.
01:22:56.037,01:22:57.605,"We got him, Harvey."
01:22:57.739,01:23:01.309,REPORTER 1: Mr. Dent! How does it feel to be the biggest hero in Gotham?
01:23:01.443,01:23:04.679,"No, I'm no hero. Gotham's finest, they're the heroes."
01:23:05.013,01:23:08.149,REPORTER 1: But you and your office have been working with the Batman all along.
01:23:08.283,01:23:11.152,"-No, but I trusted him to do the right thing. REPORTER 2: Which was?"
01:23:11.286,01:23:12.320,Saving my ass.
01:23:12.454,01:23:15.390,"All right, people, that's enough. Let him be. Let him be."
01:23:15.523,01:23:17.459,"Thank you, detective."
01:23:17.625,01:23:19.728,I've got a date with a pretty upset girlfriend.
01:23:20.061,01:23:22.364,"-I figured, counselor. REPORTER 3: Mr. Dent, sir..."
01:23:22.497,01:23:26.601,"-...how about one for the front page, sir? REPORTER 4: Mr. Dent."
01:23:38.079,01:23:41.216,Stand away! All of you!
01:23:41.349,01:23:44.753,"I don't want anything for his Mob lawyer to use, you understand?"
01:23:47.155,01:23:49.057,Back from the dead.
01:23:49.591,01:23:51.226,"I, uh..."
01:23:51.359,01:23:53.294,...couldn't risk my family's safety.
01:23:54.529,01:23:56.398,MAYOR: What do we got?
01:23:58.133,01:24:02.103,"Nothing. No matches on prints, DNA, dental."
01:24:02.237,01:24:05.040,"Clothing is custom, no labels."
01:24:05.206,01:24:07.308,Nothing in his pockets but knives and lint.
01:24:07.442,01:24:09.377,No name.
01:24:09.644,01:24:11.613,"-No other alias. MAYOR: Go home, Gordon."
01:24:11.746,01:24:14.816,The clown'll keep till morning. Go get some rest.
01:24:15.150,01:24:16.818,You're gonna need it.
01:24:17.218,01:24:19.687,Tomorrow you take the big job.
01:24:20.422,01:24:23.558,You don't have any say in the matter. Commissioner Gordon.
01:24:39.441,01:24:41.543,"I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety."
01:24:48.149,01:24:49.484,MURPHY: Look at these ugly bastards.
01:24:49.617,01:24:51.519,-I don't feel good. MURPHY: You're a cop killer.
01:24:51.653,01:24:54.122,You're lucky to be feeling anything below the neck.
01:24:54.255,01:24:55.723,-Please! -Step away from the bars!
01:24:55.857,01:24:58.193,THUG: My insides hurt.
01:25:12.340,01:25:14.175,"Did Batman save you, Daddy?"
01:25:16.311,01:25:18.546,"Actually, this time..."
01:25:18.680,01:25:20.815,...I saved him.
01:25:32.293,01:25:33.795,GORDON: Has he said anything yet?
01:25:41.469,01:25:45.640,"Evening, commissioner."
01:25:53.348,01:25:55.517,Harvey Dent never made it home.
01:25:55.650,01:25:57.752,-Of course not. -What have you done with him?
01:25:58.686,01:26:00.488,Me?
01:26:02.190,01:26:04.292,I was right here.
01:26:05.627,01:26:07.495,Who did you leave him with?
01:26:07.629,01:26:10.498,Hm? Your people?
01:26:11.599,01:26:14.869,"Assuming, of course, that they are still your people..."
01:26:15.203,01:26:17.772,...and not Maroni's.
01:26:19.941,01:26:22.443,"Does it depress you, commissioner..."
01:26:22.777,01:26:27.749,...to know just how alone you really are?
01:26:29.751,01:26:34.656,Does it make you feel responsible for Harvey Dent's current predicament?
01:26:34.789,01:26:37.525,-Where is he? -What's the time?
01:26:37.926,01:26:39.527,What difference does that make?
01:26:39.727,01:26:45.300,"Well, depending on the time, he may be in one spot or several."
01:26:51.606,01:26:54.576,-If we're gonna play games... -Mm-hm?
01:26:57.712,01:26:59.681,...I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.
01:26:59.814,01:27:03.885,"Ah, the good cop, bad cop routine?"
01:27:04.619,01:27:05.653,Not exactly.
01:27:16.264,01:27:24.539,Never start with the head. The victim gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next-- See?
01:27:24.672,01:27:26.941,You wanted me. Here I am.
01:27:30.712,01:27:33.381,And you didn't disappoint.
01:27:33.514,01:27:36.384,You let five people die.
01:27:37.352,01:27:40.888,Then you let Dent take your place.
01:27:41.022,01:27:43.725,"-Even to a guy like me, that's cold. -Where's Dent?"
01:27:43.858,01:27:48.696,Those Mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were.
01:27:49.297,01:27:53.901,But I know the truth. There's no going back. You've changed things.
01:27:54.035,01:27:56.571,-Forever. -Then why do you wanna kill me?
01:27:59.540,01:28:00.875,I don't wanna kill you.
01:28:01.476,01:28:05.913,"What would I do without you? Go back to ripping off Mob dealers? No, no."
01:28:06.047,01:28:08.549,"No. No, you...."
01:28:08.683,01:28:11.019,You complete me.
01:28:11.352,01:28:15.623,-You're garbage who kills for money. -Don't talk like one of them. You're not.
01:28:15.757,01:28:18.293,Even if you'd like to be.
01:28:19.494,01:28:21.362,"To them, you're just a freak..."
01:28:22.297,01:28:23.564,...like me.
01:28:23.698,01:28:25.933,They need you right now...
01:28:26.601,01:28:28.636,...but when they don't...
01:28:29.070,01:28:32.307,...they'll cast you out like a leper.
01:28:32.440,01:28:36.377,"You see, their morals, their code..."
01:28:36.577,01:28:38.713,...it's a bad joke.
01:28:38.913,01:28:42.383,Dropped at the first sign of trouble.
01:28:42.917,01:28:46.921,They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show you.
01:28:47.055,01:28:52.727,"When the chips are down, these-- These civilized people..."
01:28:52.860,01:28:54.929,...they'll eat each other.
01:28:55.697,01:28:57.999,"See, I'm not a monster."
01:28:59.500,01:29:00.735,I'm just ahead of the curve.
01:29:02.937,01:29:04.005,Where's Dent?
01:29:04.339,01:29:07.075,"You have all these rules, and you think they'll save you."
01:29:10.345,01:29:12.680,-He's in control. -I have one rule.
01:29:12.814,01:29:15.883,Oh. Then that's the rule you'll have to break to know the truth.
01:29:16.017,01:29:17.352,Which is?
01:29:17.485,01:29:19.821,The only sensible way to live is without rules.
01:29:19.954,01:29:22.690,And tonight you're gonna break your one rule.
01:29:22.824,01:29:23.858,I'm considering it.
01:29:23.991,01:29:26.694,"There's only minutes left, so you'll have to play my game..."
01:29:26.828,01:29:29.497,...if you wanna save one of them.
01:29:29.897,01:29:30.932,Them?
01:29:31.065,01:29:35.103,"You know, for a while there, I thought you really were Dent."
01:29:35.436,01:29:37.939,The way you threw yourself after her.
01:29:44.378,01:29:45.446,Look at you go.
01:29:50.952,01:29:54.622,Does Harvey know about you and his little bunny?
01:29:55.556,01:29:56.858,Where are they?!
01:29:56.991,01:29:58.993,Killing is making a choice.
01:29:59.127,01:30:02.396,-Where are they?! -Choose between one life or the other.
01:30:02.997,01:30:07.401,"Your friend the district attorney, or his blushing bride-to-be."
01:30:12.540,01:30:16.611,"You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with."
01:30:16.944,01:30:20.548,Nothing to do with all your strength.
01:30:20.715,01:30:24.051,"Don't worry, I'm gonna tell you where they are, both of them."
01:30:24.185,01:30:27.421,And that's the point. You'll have to choose.
01:30:28.022,01:30:30.892,He's at 250 52nd Street...
01:30:31.025,01:30:34.495,...and she's on Avenue X at Cicero.
01:30:36.564,01:30:38.166,-Which one you going after? -Rachel.
01:30:39.700,01:30:41.035,GORDON: We're getting Dent!
01:30:43.437,01:30:46.140,250 52nd Street!
01:30:51.879,01:30:54.182,Can anybody hear me?
01:30:56.717,01:30:59.220,Hello!
01:31:03.224,01:31:05.626,-Rachel? -Harvey.
01:31:05.760,01:31:07.929,"Oh, Harvey, thank God. Are you okay?"
01:31:08.062,01:31:13.534,I'm all right. I'm in a-- I'm in a warehouse. They got me wired to these oil drums.
01:31:14.569,01:31:15.736,I am too.
01:31:16.170,01:31:17.939,Harvey.
01:31:25.146,01:31:27.715,I want my phone call.
01:31:27.849,01:31:30.685,I want it. I want it. I want my phone call.
01:31:31.219,01:31:33.087,That's nice.
01:31:34.689,01:31:39.560,How many of your friends have I killed?
01:31:43.164,01:31:44.232,I'm a 20-year man...
01:31:44.565,01:31:47.935,...and I know the difference between punks who need a lesson in manners...
01:31:48.069,01:31:50.972,...and the freaks like you who would just enjoy it.
01:31:51.873,01:31:54.242,And you killed six of my friends.
01:31:55.710,01:31:58.112,Please. My insides hurt.
01:31:58.246,01:32:00.047,I don't really care. Back away.
01:32:00.181,01:32:03.517,The boss said he'd make the voices go away.
01:32:03.651,01:32:07.088,He said he'd go inside and replace them with bright lights...
01:32:07.221,01:32:08.522,...like Christmas.
01:32:08.656,01:32:11.092,"You're out of your mind, pal. Back off."
01:32:11.225,01:32:14.095,Medic to the holding tank. Come on. Get the door open.
01:32:14.262,01:32:15.596,"You guys, back off!"
01:32:15.730,01:32:17.865,"Listen, we don't have a lot of time."
01:32:17.999,01:32:22.003,They told me that only one of us was gonna make it...
01:32:22.136,01:32:25.606,...and that they were gonna let our friends choose.
01:32:28.175,01:32:30.278,"Okay, Rachel."
01:32:30.945,01:32:34.048,It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be all right. They're coming for you.
01:32:34.181,01:32:38.619,Listen to me. I'll help you. Just talk me through what's going on with you.
01:32:38.753,01:32:42.156,"-Can you find something, anything, sharp? -I'm trying."
01:32:42.290,01:32:44.625,-What's--? -Shit.
01:32:44.759,01:32:46.160,Harvey?
01:32:49.964,01:32:51.699,"Harvey, what's happening?"
01:33:00.975,01:33:04.845,"All available units, converge at 250 52nd Street."
01:33:05.112,01:33:09.183,Do you wanna know why I use a knife?
01:33:11.619,01:33:12.887,Guns are too quick.
01:33:13.020,01:33:16.324,You can't savor all the...
01:33:16.657,01:33:19.927,...little emotions.
01:33:21.862,01:33:26.767,"You see, in their last moments..."
01:33:26.901,01:33:29.136,...people show you who they really are.
01:33:30.204,01:33:35.943,"So in a way, I knew your friends better than you ever did."
01:33:39.747,01:33:43.084,Would you like to know which of them were cowards?
01:33:49.690,01:33:51.225,OFFICER: What's that? MEDIC: Jeez.
01:33:51.392,01:33:53.627,He's got some kind of a...
01:33:53.761,01:33:56.931,-...contusion. -I know you're gonna enjoy this.
01:33:58.232,01:34:02.036,I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it even more.
01:34:07.208,01:34:08.642,"OFFICER 1: Whoa, whoa!"
01:34:09.677,01:34:10.711,OFFICER 2: Just put it down.
01:34:10.845,01:34:13.681,Take it easy. Take it easy. Drop the weapon now!
01:34:13.814,01:34:17.785,"-It's my own damn fault, just shoot him! -Let him go now! Drop it!"
01:34:18.019,01:34:21.022,-What? Sorry? -What do you want?
01:34:22.056,01:34:23.991,I just want my phone call.
01:34:26.994,01:34:29.730,RACHEL: What--? What--? What's happening?
01:34:29.864,01:34:32.733,"Just talk to me, just for one second."
01:34:35.002,01:34:37.738,-All right? -Right.
01:34:39.673,01:34:41.008,Ow.
01:34:41.942,01:34:43.411,"-Ow. -Shh, shh, shh."
01:34:49.383,01:34:51.419,Is that a phone?
01:35:01.162,01:35:02.430,Mount the curb!
01:35:10.438,01:35:14.442,"Harvey, just in case, I wanna tell you something, okay?"
01:35:14.775,01:35:16.410,Don't think like that. They're coming.
01:35:16.744,01:35:18.979,"I know they are, but I don't want them to."
01:35:23.317,01:35:27.388,"I don't wanna live without you, and I do have an answer for you."
01:35:27.922,01:35:29.723,My answer is yes.
01:35:32.326,01:35:35.129,No! No! No!
01:35:35.262,01:35:37.965,Not me! Why are you coming for me?
01:35:38.099,01:35:39.133,No!
01:35:40.868,01:35:42.336,Rachel! Rachel!
01:35:42.503,01:35:44.972,-Harvey. -No! No! Rachel!
01:35:45.106,01:35:46.140,Okay.
01:35:46.273,01:35:47.341,Rachel!
01:35:47.875,01:35:49.310,No! No!
01:35:49.443,01:35:53.747,"Harvey, it's okay. It's all right. Listen."
01:35:53.881,01:36:02.223,"Somewh-- RAMIREZ: No, commissioner!"
01:36:02.356,01:36:05.092,Rachel! No!
01:36:19.373,01:36:20.474,Hello there.
01:36:26.380,01:36:29.984,"SERGEANT: Back at the MCU, the Joker's gone."
01:36:30.918,01:36:32.486,With Lau?
01:36:35.322,01:36:37.992,The Joker planned to be caught.
01:36:38.259,01:36:40.394,He wanted me to lock him up in the MCU.
01:37:00.114,01:37:06.387,RACHEL: Dear Bruce: I need to be honest and clear.
01:37:08.422,01:37:11.058,I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.
01:37:11.192,01:37:15.129,"I love him, and I wanna spend the rest of my life with him."
01:37:15.563,01:37:20.100,"When I told you that if Gotham no longer needed Batman, we could be together..."
01:37:20.234,01:37:22.403,...I meant it.
01:37:22.603,01:37:27.408,But now I'm sure the day won't come when you no longer need Batman.
01:37:28.442,01:37:30.377,I hope it does.
01:37:30.511,01:37:33.314,"And if it does, I will be there..."
01:37:33.948,01:37:35.282,...but as your friend.
01:37:36.050,01:37:38.252,"I'm sorry, Harvey."
01:37:38.385,01:37:40.888,RACHEL: I'm sorry to let you down.
01:37:41.021,01:37:46.026,"If you lose your faith in me, please keep your faith in people."
01:37:46.493,01:37:51.031,"Love, now and always, Rachel."
01:37:59.006,01:38:01.275,ALFRED: Prepared a little breakfast.
01:38:05.379,01:38:07.314,"-Very well, then. -Alfred."
01:38:07.448,01:38:08.582,"Yes, Master Wayne?"
01:38:10.084,01:38:12.286,Did I bring this on her?
01:38:13.320,01:38:15.489,I was meant to inspire good...
01:38:15.623,01:38:18.125,"...not madness, not death."
01:38:18.259,01:38:22.963,You have inspired good. But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals.
01:38:23.097,01:38:25.165,Didn't you think there might be casualties?
01:38:25.299,01:38:27.635,Things always get worse before they get better.
01:38:28.102,01:38:29.470,"But Rachel, Alfred."
01:38:29.603,01:38:33.440,Rachel believed in what you stood for...
01:38:33.574,01:38:35.509,...what we stand for.
01:38:35.643,01:38:37.211,Gotham needs you.
01:38:37.645,01:38:40.614,"No, Gotham needs its true hero..."
01:38:41.215,01:38:45.319,...and I let that murdering psychopath blow him half to hell.
01:38:45.452,01:38:47.921,"Which is why, for now..."
01:38:48.555,01:38:50.491,...they're gonna have to make do with you.
01:38:52.660,01:38:54.528,"She was gonna wait for me, Alfred."
01:38:56.530,01:38:58.565,Dent doesn't know.
01:38:58.699,01:39:00.134,He can never know.
01:39:02.469,01:39:04.171,What's that?
01:39:04.305,01:39:07.274,-It can wait. -That bandit...
01:39:07.641,01:39:09.943,...in the forest in Burma.
01:39:10.077,01:39:12.112,-Did you catch him? -Yes.
01:39:12.246,01:39:13.514,How?
01:39:15.049,01:39:16.550,We burned the forest down.
01:39:55.723,01:39:58.459,"He's credible, an M &amp; A lawyer from a leading consultancy."
01:39:58.592,01:40:02.096,He says he's waited as long as he can for Batman to do the right thing.
01:40:02.229,01:40:04.298,Now he's taking matters into his own hands.
01:40:04.431,01:40:07.401,We'll be live at 5 with the true identity of the Batman.
01:40:23.751,01:40:25.452,I'm sorry about Rachel.
01:40:28.222,01:40:33.093,"The doctor says you're in agonizing pain, but that you won't accept medication."
01:40:34.128,01:40:36.096,That you're refusing to...
01:40:36.230,01:40:38.031,...accept skin grafts.
01:40:38.298,01:40:40.501,Remember that name...
01:40:41.168,01:40:43.437,...you all had for me...
01:40:43.804,01:40:46.673,...when I was at Internal Affairs?
01:40:49.243,01:40:50.477,"What was it, Gordon?"
01:40:51.211,01:40:52.513,"Harvey, I...."
01:40:52.646,01:40:54.248,Say it.
01:40:55.582,01:40:57.518,Say it!
01:41:05.259,01:41:08.328,Two-Face. Harvey Two-Face.
01:41:09.797,01:41:14.234,Why should I hide who I am?
01:41:15.402,01:41:16.670,I know you tried to warn me.
01:41:17.571,01:41:18.739,I'm sorry.
01:41:19.440,01:41:22.142,Wuertz picked you up. Was he working for them?
01:41:24.378,01:41:26.680,Do you know who picked up Rachel?
01:41:27.548,01:41:30.551,"Harvey, I need to know which of my men I can trust."
01:41:30.851,01:41:33.153,Why would you listen to me now?
01:41:34.254,01:41:35.789,"I'm sorry, Harvey."
01:41:38.425,01:41:40.260,No.
01:41:40.627,01:41:42.729,"No, you're not."
01:41:43.764,01:41:45.165,Not yet.
01:41:50.370,01:41:53.140,"This craziness, it's too much."
01:41:53.307,01:41:56.510,Should've thought about that before you let the clown out of the box.
01:41:56.643,01:41:58.445,MARONI: You want him?
01:42:00.814,01:42:03.317,I can tell you where he'll be this afternoon.
01:42:11.325,01:42:13.560,CHECHEN: Not so crazy as you look.
01:42:13.694,01:42:17.498,"I told you, I'm a man of my word."
01:42:20.667,01:42:21.869,Where is the Italian?
01:42:22.202,01:42:25.305,All tactical units will converge on the location in 20 minutes.
01:42:25.439,01:42:28.809,I want auxiliary units to cover all possible getaway routes.
01:42:29.476,01:42:30.611,CHECHEN: Please.
01:42:30.744,01:42:34.214,"Joker-man, what you do with all your money?"
01:42:34.748,01:42:37.484,"You see, I'm a guy of simple taste."
01:42:37.618,01:42:39.353,I enjoy...
01:42:39.486,01:42:40.787,...dynamite...
01:42:40.921,01:42:42.556,...and gunpowder...
01:42:42.923,01:42:45.459,...and gasoline.
01:42:46.827,01:42:49.229,"-What the--? -Ah, ah, ah."
01:42:50.898,01:42:53.767,And you know the thing that they have in common?
01:42:54.368,01:42:55.602,They're cheap.
01:42:58.605,01:43:02.576,"This is our chance. I want Lau alive. The Joker, either way."
01:43:02.709,01:43:04.244,"Hey, Jim. Get a load of this."
01:43:04.378,01:43:05.646,ENGEL: Let's take the next caller.
01:43:05.779,01:43:07.915,CALLER 2: Harvey Dent didn't wanna give in to this maniac.
01:43:08.248,01:43:09.483,You think you know better?
01:43:09.616,01:43:12.920,"I think that if we could talk to Dent today, he may feel differently."
01:43:13.253,01:43:17.324,"And we wish him a speedy recovery. Because God knows, we need him now."
01:43:17.457,01:43:19.626,You said you were a man of your word.
01:43:19.860,01:43:21.895,"Oh, I am."
01:43:23.664,01:43:26.400,I'm only burning my half.
01:43:27.668,01:43:29.770,All you care about is money.
01:43:29.903,01:43:33.473,This town deserves a better class of criminal...
01:43:33.607,01:43:35.809,...and I'm gonna give it to them.
01:43:36.643,01:43:39.246,Tell your men they work for me now.
01:43:39.379,01:43:41.682,This is my city.
01:43:42.416,01:43:44.851,They won't work for a freak.
01:43:49.590,01:43:50.958,...and feed you to your pooches? Hm?
01:43:51.291,01:43:53.994,And then we'll see how loyal a hungry dog really is.
01:43:55.996,01:43:58.465,It's not about money...
01:43:58.599,01:44:01.768,...it's about sending a message.
01:44:02.603,01:44:04.972,Everything burns.
01:44:07.574,01:44:09.710,-Who is this? JOKER: I had a vision...
01:44:09.843,01:44:12.646,...of a world without Batman.
01:44:12.779,01:44:14.982,The Mob ground out a little profit...
01:44:15.315,01:44:19.252,...and the police tried to shut them down one block at a time.
01:44:19.386,01:44:22.623,And it was so boring.
01:44:22.756,01:44:24.725,I've had a change of heart.
01:44:24.858,01:44:27.561,I don't want Mr. Reese spoiling everything...
01:44:27.694,01:44:32.466,...but why should I have all the fun? Let's give someone else a chance.
01:44:32.599,01:44:37.471,If Coleman Reese isn't dead in 60 minutes...
01:44:37.604,01:44:39.673,...then I blow up a hospital.
01:44:39.806,01:44:41.475,Call in every officer.
01:44:41.608,01:44:44.878,Tell them to head to their nearest hospital and start evac and search.
01:44:45.012,01:44:48.949,"Call the transit authority, school board, prisons. Get every bus down to a hospital."
01:44:49.282,01:44:53.754,The priority is Gotham General. Wheel everybody out of that place right now.
01:44:53.887,01:44:55.622,"You, you and you, you come with me."
01:44:55.756,01:44:57.691,"-Where are we going, sir? -To get Reese."
01:44:57.891,01:45:00.994,"I need you plugged in, checking Gordon's men and their families."
01:45:01.328,01:45:03.497,-Looking for? -Hospital admissions.
01:45:03.630,01:45:05.365,Will you be wanting the Batpod?
01:45:05.499,01:45:07.467,In the middle of the day? Not very subtle.
01:45:07.601,01:45:08.835,"The Lamborghini, then."
01:45:09.770,01:45:10.871,Much more subtle.
01:45:24.751,01:45:27.354,Excuse me. Let me through. Excuse me. Okay.
01:45:27.487,01:45:30.891,"Sir, could you help, please?"
01:45:31.024,01:45:32.793,I'm gonna find a bus for him.
01:45:34.761,01:45:36.663,"ENGEL: Sir? Commissioner, do you really think..."
01:45:36.797,01:45:38.932,...an ordinary citizen would try to kill this man?
01:45:43.537,01:45:45.806,ENGEL: Sir. Commissioner.
01:45:47.874,01:45:50.043,Get the cars around the back!
01:45:52.546,01:45:53.814,"Go. Keep rolling, Sam."
01:45:59.786,01:46:01.755,I see O'Brien and Richards.
01:46:02.422,01:46:05.826,No immediate family member admitted to a Gotham hospital.
01:46:07.060,01:46:10.697,"REESE: They're trying to kill me. -Well, maybe Batman can save you."
01:46:23.810,01:46:26.513,"Davis, they got space. Bring him out."
01:46:28.048,01:46:29.883,Davis.
01:46:34.988,01:46:37.457,I saw Burns and Zachary.
01:46:37.591,01:46:38.759,ALFRED: Nothing on them.
01:46:38.892,01:46:40.460,And a patrolman I don't know.
01:46:41.628,01:46:43.563,"REESE: Okay, so, what now?"
01:46:44.464,01:46:46.666,What do we do now? Where are we going?
01:46:49.469,01:46:51.004,Send the information to Gordon.
01:46:58.879,01:47:00.547,Get out of here.
01:47:02.582,01:47:04.417,Davis.
01:47:07.554,01:47:09.890,"Ma'am, we're gonna have to move him now."
01:47:21.635,01:47:23.904,"GORDON: It's Berg, isn't it? -Commissioner."
01:47:25.005,01:47:26.573,"You okay, son?"
01:47:44.591,01:47:46.059,Hi.
01:47:50.931,01:47:52.532,You know...
01:47:53.200,01:47:56.469,"...I don't want there to be any hard feelings between us, Harvey."
01:47:56.603,01:47:59.706,-When you and-- -Rachel!
01:47:59.840,01:48:02.075,--Rachel were being abducted...
01:48:02.209,01:48:05.212,...I was sitting in Gordon's cage.
01:48:05.679,01:48:07.614,I didn't rig those charges.
01:48:07.781,01:48:10.150,"Your men, your plan."
01:48:10.517,01:48:12.886,Do I really look like a guy with a plan?
01:48:13.220,01:48:16.056,You know what I am? I'm a dog chasing cars.
01:48:16.756,01:48:19.125,I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it.
01:48:19.259,01:48:22.562,You know? I just do things.
01:48:22.863,01:48:26.633,The Mob has plans. The cops have plans.
01:48:26.766,01:48:28.935,Gordon's got plans.
01:48:29.069,01:48:32.038,"You know, they're schemers."
01:48:32.172,01:48:35.976,Schemers trying to control their little worlds.
01:48:36.109,01:48:37.711,I'm not a schemer.
01:48:37.844,01:48:39.546,I try to show the schemers...
01:48:39.679,01:48:44.918,...how pathetic their attempts to control things really are.
01:48:45.886,01:48:48.922,So when I say-- Ah. Come here.
01:48:49.522,01:48:52.959,When I say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal...
01:48:54.594,01:48:56.763,...you'll know that I'm telling the truth.
01:48:59.165,01:49:02.002,-I'm gonna need your weapon. -What?
01:49:05.805,01:49:07.674,Why? Because my wife's in the hospital?
01:49:08.241,01:49:09.876,"Yeah, that'd be why."
01:49:10.810,01:49:13.980,It's the schemers that put you where you are.
01:49:14.114,01:49:17.951,"You were a schemer, you had plans..."
01:49:18.084,01:49:20.220,...and look where that got you.
01:49:33.667,01:49:35.769,...urging people not to take matters into their hands.
01:49:35.902,01:49:38.338,I just did what I do best.
01:49:38.672,01:49:42.175,I took your little plan and I turned it on itself.
01:49:42.309,01:49:47.781,Look what I did to this city with a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets.
01:49:47.914,01:49:51.151,Hm? You know what I noticed?
01:49:51.284,01:49:54.921,Nobody panics when things go according to plan.
01:49:55.055,01:49:56.790,Even if the plan is horrifying.
01:49:57.290,01:50:02.329,"If tomorrow I tell the press that, like, a gangbanger will get shot..."
01:50:02.662,01:50:06.032,...or a truckload of soldiers will be blowing up...
01:50:06.266,01:50:07.334,...nobody panics.
01:50:08.101,01:50:11.171,Because it's all part of the plan.
01:50:11.304,01:50:16.242,But when I say that one little old mayor will die...
01:50:16.643,01:50:18.979,"...well, then, everyone loses their minds."
01:50:22.315,01:50:25.251,Introduce a little anarchy...
01:50:26.386,01:50:28.788,...upset the established order...
01:50:28.922,01:50:33.360,...and everything becomes chaos.
01:50:35.228,01:50:38.031,I'm an agent of chaos.
01:50:38.331,01:50:40.800,"Oh, and you know the thing about chaos?"
01:50:42.836,01:50:44.337,It's fair.
01:50:53.713,01:50:56.850,-You live. -Mm-hm.
01:50:57.250,01:50:58.952,You die.
01:50:59.119,01:51:01.121,Mmm. Now we're talking.
01:51:10.397,01:51:11.998,Mr. Reese.
01:51:30.150,01:51:32.285,"That's Mr. Wayne, isn't it?"
01:51:32.419,01:51:35.422,-That was a very brave thing you did. -Trying to catch the light?
01:51:35.889,01:51:38.758,-You weren't protecting the van? -Why? Who's in it?
01:51:44.130,01:51:46.199,Don't you think I should go to the hospital?
01:51:46.332,01:51:48.935,"Don't watch a whole lot of news, do you, Mr. Wayne?"
01:52:55.068,01:52:56.936,Southeast.
01:52:57.070,01:52:59.239,It's Gotham General.
01:53:00.039,01:53:01.774,-Did you clear the building? OFFICER: Yeah.
01:53:04.777,01:53:07.981,"GORDON: You must know how many were inside. You have patient lists, roll call."
01:53:08.114,01:53:10.383,Right now we're showing 50 people missing. One bus.
01:53:10.517,01:53:13.853,The other buses were heading off to hospitals. I guess we missed one.
01:53:13.987,01:53:16.089,What's your guess about where Harvey Dent is?
01:53:16.222,01:53:20.793,"Keep looking. And keep it to yourself. Anybody asks, we got him out."
01:53:23.263,01:53:25.798,Get me the mayor's office on the line.
01:53:26.933,01:53:28.535,We're gonna need the National Guard.
01:53:32.005,01:53:35.208,I'm now being told that we're cutting to a video GCN has just received.
01:53:35.341,01:53:37.277,I'm Mike Engel for Gotham Tonight.
01:53:37.877,01:53:41.147,What does it take to make you people wanna join in?
01:53:41.281,01:53:43.950,You failed to kill the lawyer. I've gotta get you off the bench...
01:53:44.083,01:53:45.885,-...and into the game. JOKER: Bench. Game.
01:53:48.021,01:53:50.123,"ENGEL: Come nightfall, this city is mine. JOKER: Mine."
01:53:50.256,01:53:53.059,-And anyone left here plays by my rules. -Rules.
01:53:53.293,01:53:56.563,Mr. Fox? Security is showing a break-in at the R &amp; D Department.
01:53:56.896,01:53:58.998,If you don't wanna be in the game...
01:53:59.132,01:54:00.433,-...get out now. -Get out now.
01:54:02.569,01:54:05.538,But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd are sure in for a surprise.
01:54:06.039,01:54:07.607,"Ha-ha, ha-ha."
01:54:41.341,01:54:43.543,REPORTER: Gotham P.D. has shut down... BARTENDER: Sweet Jesus.
01:54:43.877,01:54:45.278,...the area's bridges and tunnels.
01:54:45.411,01:54:48.948,"Shouldn't you be out there, you know, doing something?"
01:54:49.082,01:54:51.050,It's my day off.
01:54:51.551,01:54:53.219,I gotta take a leak.
01:54:53.353,01:54:55.622,"Keep an eye out for me, will you?"
01:55:01.294,01:55:03.263,Now what? Need someone to shake it for you?
01:55:03.396,01:55:05.064,DENT: Hello.
01:55:05.632,01:55:07.233,Dent.
01:55:07.367,01:55:09.535,Jesus. I thought you was dead.
01:55:09.669,01:55:11.404,Half.
01:55:17.443,01:55:19.112,"Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?"
01:55:19.245,01:55:21.247,-It must've been Maroni's men. -Shut up!
01:55:23.049,01:55:27.086,Are you telling me that you're gonna protect the other traitor in Gordon's unit?
01:55:27.220,01:55:28.588,"I don't know, he never told me."
01:55:28.922,01:55:32.425,"Listen, Dent, I swear to God, I didn't know what they were gonna do to you."
01:55:34.060,01:55:35.194,That's funny...
01:55:36.996,01:55:39.599,...because I don't know what's gonna happen to you either.
01:55:43.670,01:55:45.638,"Beautiful, isn't it?"
01:55:46.139,01:55:47.674,Beautiful.
01:55:48.308,01:55:49.409,Unethical.
01:55:50.543,01:55:52.178,Dangerous.
01:55:52.345,01:55:55.949,You've turned every cell phone in Gotham into a microphone.
01:55:56.082,01:55:58.418,BATMAN: And a high-frequency generator-receiver.
01:55:58.551,01:56:03.623,You took my sonar concept and applied it to every phone in the city.
01:56:03.957,01:56:08.428,"With half the city feeding you sonar, you can image all of Gotham."
01:56:10.363,01:56:11.664,This is wrong.
01:56:11.998,01:56:14.033,"I've gotta find this man, Lucius."
01:56:16.035,01:56:17.270,At what cost?
01:56:17.403,01:56:20.239,The database is null-key encrypted.
01:56:20.373,01:56:22.542,It can only be accessed by one person.
01:56:24.010,01:56:26.145,This is too much power for one person.
01:56:26.279,01:56:28.414,That's why I gave it to you.
01:56:28.982,01:56:30.149,Only you can use it.
01:56:30.283,01:56:34.120,Spying on 30 million people isn't part of my job description.
01:56:36.289,01:56:40.059,This is an audio sample. If he talks within range of any phone in the city...
01:56:40.193,01:56:42.362,...you can triangulate his position.
01:56:42.729,01:56:45.331,I'll help you this one time.
01:56:45.698,01:56:47.533,But consider this my resignation.
01:56:47.667,01:56:52.338,"As long as this machine is at Wayne Enterprises, I won't be."
01:56:53.139,01:56:55.074,When you're finished...
01:56:55.608,01:56:56.709,...type in your name.
01:57:05.385,01:57:08.454,GORDON: My officers are going over every inch of the tunnels and bridges...
01:57:08.588,01:57:11.758,"...but with the Joker's threat, they're not an option."
01:57:12.091,01:57:14.761,-And land routes east? -Backed up for hours.
01:57:15.094,01:57:18.598,"Which leaves the ferries with 30,000 ready to board."
01:57:18.731,01:57:21.768,I wanna use the ferries so I can get those prisoners off the island.
01:57:22.235,01:57:25.071,The men you put away? Those aren't people I'm worried about.
01:57:25.204,01:57:27.306,You should be. Whatever the Joker's planning...
01:57:27.440,01:57:32.045,...it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners are involved. I wanna get them out of here.
01:57:33.413,01:57:34.580,So where is Harvey?
01:57:35.248,01:57:38.384,"-We haven't found him. -Oh, Jesus."
01:57:42.255,01:57:44.323,How long can you keep this quiet?
01:57:58.404,01:58:01.140,"Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing."
01:58:01.808,01:58:04.143,Going to join your wife?
01:58:07.547,01:58:10.149,-You love her? -Yes.
01:58:10.850,01:58:13.820,You ever imagine what it would be like to listen to her die?
01:58:14.153,01:58:15.555,"Look, take it up with the Joker."
01:58:15.688,01:58:19.092,He killed your woman. He made you...
01:58:19.225,01:58:20.259,...like this.
01:58:20.560,01:58:23.563,The Joker's just a mad dog.
01:58:23.696,01:58:26.399,I want whoever let him off the leash.
01:58:27.166,01:58:30.436,"I took care of Wuertz, but who was your other man inside Gordon's unit?"
01:58:30.570,01:58:33.272,Who picked up Rachel? Must have been someone she trusted.
01:58:34.440,01:58:36.542,"Look, if I tell you..."
01:58:36.676,01:58:37.710,...will you let me go?
01:58:38.511,01:58:39.779,Can't hurt your chances.
01:58:42.582,01:58:44.317,It was Ramirez.
01:58:49.655,01:58:52.859,-But you said-- -I said it couldn't hurt your chances.
01:58:56.529,01:58:58.631,You're a lucky man.
01:59:02.201,01:59:03.803,-But he's not. -Who?
01:59:06.739,01:59:08.274,Your driver.
01:59:21.487,01:59:22.488,GUARDSMAN 1: Stand back.
01:59:22.622,01:59:24.891,"Hey, that ain't right. We should be on that boat."
01:59:25.224,01:59:27.693,GUARDSMAN 2: You wanna ride across with them? Be my guest.
01:59:50.883,01:59:52.652,"FIRST MATE: Sir, they've stopped their engines."
01:59:52.785,01:59:53.786,"Right, get on the radio."
01:59:53.920,01:59:57.657,Tell them we'll come back and pick them up once we dump the scumbags.
01:59:57.790,02:00:00.293,"Liberty, this is Spirit. Come in."
02:00:02.328,02:00:03.496,CAPTAIN: What the heck was that?
02:00:05.431,02:00:06.799,MAN: What the--?
02:00:12.338,02:00:14.273,"Liberty, we have the same thing. We've lost both engines."
02:00:14.407,02:00:15.808,"-Liberty, come in. BATMAN: Fox."
02:00:15.942,02:00:18.544,There's something going on on the ferries.
02:00:19.345,02:00:21.581,Get down to the engine room now.
02:00:22.281,02:00:24.450,"MAN: Hey, buddy, what's happening?"
02:00:32.925,02:00:36.495,"Captain, we got a hundred barrels down there rigged to blow. And this."
02:00:49.575,02:00:50.643,"CAPTAIN: Oh, my God."
02:00:50.776,02:00:52.645,FIRST MATE: Looks like some kind of detonator.
02:00:52.778,02:00:55.681,CAPTAIN: Why would they give us the detonator to our own bomb?
02:01:05.725,02:01:09.595,Through the magic of diesel fuel and ammonium nitrate...
02:01:09.729,02:01:13.799,...I'm ready right now to blow you all sky-high.
02:01:13.933,02:01:16.002,"Liberty, come in, over."
02:01:17.570,02:01:18.604,It's dead.
02:01:18.871,02:01:23.476,"JOKER: If anyone attempts to get off their boat, you all die."
02:01:23.743,02:01:24.977,FOX: I'm zeroing in.
02:01:25.311,02:01:29.749,JOKER: Each of you has a remote to blow up the other boat.
02:01:29.882,02:01:32.451,His voice is on the ferry...
02:01:32.585,02:01:34.620,...but it's not the source.
02:01:36.822,02:01:37.923,West.
02:01:45.331,02:01:47.566,-Gordon. BATMAN: I have the Joker's location.
02:01:47.700,02:01:48.768,Prewitt Building.
02:01:48.901,02:01:51.470,Assemble on the building opposite.
02:01:52.772,02:01:55.608,"At midnight, I blow you all up."
02:01:55.741,02:02:00.880,"If, however, one of you presses the button, I'll let that boat live."
02:02:01.013,02:02:03.316,So who's it gonna be?
02:02:03.449,02:02:05.885,Harvey Dent's most-wanted scumbag collection...
02:02:06.018,02:02:09.488,...or the sweet and innocent civilians?
02:02:09.622,02:02:12.058,You choose.
02:02:12.391,02:02:14.327,"Oh, and you might wanna decide quickly..."
02:02:14.460,02:02:18.731,...because the people on the other boat may not be quite so noble.
02:02:26.072,02:02:27.073,Stay back.
02:02:27.406,02:02:31.043,"Well, now, who are you to decide? We ought to talk this over, at least."
02:02:31.544,02:02:35.014,We don't all have to die. Those men had their chance.
02:02:35.715,02:02:39.552,-We are not going to talk about this. -Why aren't we talking about it?
02:02:39.685,02:02:42.355,They're talking over the same thing on the other boat.
02:02:42.488,02:02:44.724,-Let's put it to a vote. CROWD: Yes!
02:02:49.962,02:02:52.631,"-Hello? RAMIREZ: Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez."
02:02:52.765,02:02:55.801,Jim needs you to pack up and put the kids in the car right away.
02:02:55.935,02:02:57.703,But the units outside....
02:02:57.837,02:02:59.505,Those cops can't be trusted.
02:02:59.638,02:03:02.608,Jim needs you away from them as soon as possible.
02:03:02.742,02:03:05.711,"I'll call them off for 10 minutes, and you'll have to move fast."
02:03:05.845,02:03:09.715,-But where am I supposed to take them? -250 52nd Street.
02:03:09.849,02:03:12.385,-Leave as soon as the patrol car pulls out. -Okay.
02:03:13.686,02:03:15.521,She believe you?
02:03:15.688,02:03:17.723,It's because she trusts you...
02:03:17.990,02:03:19.058,...just like Rachel did.
02:03:19.392,02:03:21.460,-I didn't know-- -Didn't know what they'd do?
02:03:21.594,02:03:24.397,You're the second cop to say that to me.
02:03:24.597,02:03:26.699,What exactly did you think they were gonna do?
02:03:26.832,02:03:29.034,They got me early on. My mother's hospital bills....
02:03:29.168,02:03:32.405,-Don't! -I'm sorry.
02:03:32.838,02:03:35.408,"You live to fight another day, officer."
02:03:39.044,02:03:40.913,SWAT LEADER: We found the missing hospital bus.
02:03:41.046,02:03:42.815,GORDON: Then we have a hostage situation.
02:03:44.884,02:03:46.886,It's a shooting gallery.
02:03:47.186,02:03:49.622,Why would he choose a spot with such big windows?
02:03:49.755,02:03:51.624,SWAT LEADER: We have clear shots on five clowns.
02:03:51.757,02:03:54.560,"Snipers take them out, smash the windows, a team rappels in."
02:03:54.894,02:03:56.495,Team moves in by the stairwells.
02:03:56.629,02:03:58.731,"Two, three casualties max."
02:03:58.864,02:04:00.766,-Let's do it. BATMAN: It's not that simple.
02:04:00.900,02:04:03.169,"-With the Joker, it never is. -What's simple is..."
02:04:03.502,02:04:09.208,"...every second, those people on the ferries get closer to blowing-- -That won't happen. -Then he'll blow both of them up!"
02:04:09.542,02:04:13.145,-We don't have time for paper ballots. -I want everybody to put their votes...
02:04:13.479,02:04:15.481,...on this piece of paper.
02:04:16.515,02:04:19.185,"If anyone's got pens, pass it along."
02:04:19.652,02:04:23.489,GUARDSMAN: Thank you. Anybody else? Coming through. Anybody else? Thank you.
02:04:23.622,02:04:26.525,COMMANDER: We need to get these votes in quickly.
02:04:26.659,02:04:28.093,Come on.
02:04:30.095,02:04:32.198,PRISONER 1: What are you waiting for? Push the button!
02:04:32.531,02:04:34.500,PRISONER 2: We're running out of time!
02:04:35.734,02:04:37.603,I need five minutes alone.
02:04:37.736,02:04:39.605,No! There's no time!
02:04:39.738,02:04:41.073,We have clear shots!
02:04:41.207,02:04:44.143,Dent is in there with them. We have to save Dent!
02:04:44.477,02:04:46.245,I have to save Dent.
02:04:46.579,02:04:47.680,Get ready.
02:04:50.549,02:04:53.085,"Two minutes, then we breach."
02:04:58.757,02:05:00.159,"Fox, I need picture."
02:05:03.195,02:05:05.764,"-Hello? BARBARA: Jim, we're in trouble."
02:05:06.966,02:05:09.201,"FOX: Okay, you got POV on alpha..."
02:05:10.236,02:05:12.204,...omni on beta.
02:05:13.772,02:05:17.076,Looks like clowns and hostages on two floors.
02:05:17.209,02:05:19.745,There's a SWAT team on the stairwell.
02:05:22.982,02:05:25.684,Another SWAT team on the roof.
02:05:27.119,02:05:28.287,TEAM LEADER: Line's clear.
02:05:30.089,02:05:32.858,"-Barbara, calm down. -He has the kids!"

02:05:37.029,02:05:40.199,-Where's my family? -Where my family died.
02:05:43.269,02:05:45.004,"SWAT LEADER: Blue team, acquire the target."
02:05:46.739,02:05:49.208,"Entry team, set your charge."
02:06:05.157,02:06:08.761,"BATMAN: Fox, the SWATs are targeting the wrong people. The clowns are the hostages."
02:06:09.328,02:06:11.163,"Red team, go! Red team, go!"
02:06:14.967,02:06:16.302,"Entry team, blow and go!"
02:06:20.573,02:06:21.907,Don't move.
02:06:23.042,02:06:24.343,SWAT LEADER: Take the shot.
02:06:30.049,02:06:31.784,FOX: Those SWATs are coming in hot.
02:06:31.917,02:06:33.786,"SWAT 1: Clowns, put down your guns."

02:07:14.126,02:07:16.795,See those bad guys on the floor above?
02:07:16.929,02:07:19.932,They're waiting to ambush the SWAT team coming up the elevator.
02:07:20.299,02:07:21.333,SWAT LEADER: Sixty seconds.
02:07:29.775,02:07:34.246,"The tally is 140 against, 396 for."
02:07:42.354,02:07:44.990,So go ahead. Do it.
02:07:45.124,02:07:47.126,We're still here.
02:07:48.260,02:07:51.230,And that means they haven't killed us yet either.
02:07:52.798,02:07:54.400,"TEAM LEADER: Go, go, go!"
02:07:54.733,02:07:56.368,"Blue team, cover!"
02:07:59.338,02:08:00.372,Uh-oh.

02:10:22.581,02:10:25.551,Fine. I'll do it.
02:10:27.286,02:10:30.055,Those men on that boat? They made their choices.
02:10:30.189,02:10:32.424,They chose to murder and steal.
02:10:32.558,02:10:35.928,It doesn't make any sense for us to have to die too.
02:10:45.304,02:10:47.873,All the old familiar places.
02:10:54.112,02:10:55.180,FOX: Stand by.

02:11:47.499,02:11:49.368,There won't be any fireworks.
02:11:49.902,02:11:53.071,And here we go.
02:12:32.344,02:12:34.279,What were you trying to prove?
02:12:34.413,02:12:37.382,"That deep down, everyone's as ugly as you?"
02:12:38.483,02:12:39.518,You're alone.
02:12:46.191,02:12:51.596,Can't rely on anyone these days. You gotta do everything yourself. Don't we?
02:12:51.964,02:12:54.633,That's okay. I came prepared.
02:12:55.000,02:12:59.371,"It's a funny world we live in. Speaking of which, you know how I got these scars?"
02:12:59.504,02:13:02.374,"No, but I know how you got these."
02:13:20.225,02:13:23.028,"Oh, you."
02:13:23.161,02:13:26.198,"You just couldn't let me go, could you?"
02:13:27.299,02:13:31.236,This is what happens when an unstoppable force...
02:13:31.370,02:13:35.741,...meets an immovable object.
02:13:36.408,02:13:41.747,"You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?"
02:13:42.080,02:13:44.649,Huh? You won't kill me...
02:13:44.783,02:13:51.189,...out of some misplaced sense of self-righteousness.
02:13:51.323,02:13:54.493,And I won't kill you...
02:13:54.626,02:13:58.463,...because you're just too much fun.
02:13:59.498,02:14:03.635,I think you and I are destined to do this forever.
02:14:03.769,02:14:05.771,You'll be in a padded cell forever.
02:14:06.104,02:14:07.773,Maybe we could share one.
02:14:08.106,02:14:12.244,"You know, they'll be doubling up, the rate this city's inhabitants are losing their minds."
02:14:12.377,02:14:15.480,This city just showed you...
02:14:15.614,02:14:19.651,...that it's full of people ready to believe in good.
02:14:19.785,02:14:23.121,Until their spirit breaks completely.
02:14:23.822,02:14:28.693,Until they get a good look at the real Harvey Dent...
02:14:28.827,02:14:31.663,...and all the heroic things he's done.
02:14:33.398,02:14:38.437,You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle for Gotham's soul...
02:14:38.570,02:14:41.506,...in a fistfight with you?
02:14:42.140,02:14:43.575,No.
02:14:43.708,02:14:47.245,You need an ace in the hole.
02:14:47.379,02:14:49.081,Mine's Harvey.
02:14:49.381,02:14:51.149,What did you do?
02:14:51.283,02:14:54.286,I took Gotham's white knight...
02:14:54.419,02:14:58.123,...and I brought him down to our level.
02:14:58.457,02:15:01.426,"It wasn't hard. See, madness, as you know..."
02:15:01.560,02:15:04.596,...is like gravity.
02:15:04.729,02:15:07.199,All it takes is a little push.
02:15:24.149,02:15:25.750,Dent!
02:15:46.738,02:15:51.209,"DENT: This is where they brought her, Gordon, after your men handed her over."
02:15:51.810,02:15:53.478,This is where she died.
02:15:53.612,02:15:55.881,"I know, I was here..."
02:15:56.915,02:15:59.718,-...trying to save her. -But you didn't.
02:16:00.152,02:16:03.488,"-I couldn't. -Yes, you could've. If you'd listened to me."
02:16:03.622,02:16:06.324,If you stood up against corruption...
02:16:06.458,02:16:08.627,...instead of doing your deal with the devil.
02:16:08.760,02:16:10.462,I was trying to fight the Mob!
02:16:10.862,02:16:15.734,You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself if you knew what I'd lost.
02:16:17.169,02:16:20.272,Have you ever had to talk to the person you loved most...
02:16:20.405,02:16:24.309,"...tell them it's gonna be all right, when you know it's not?"
02:16:25.844,02:16:29.748,"Well, you're about to know what that feels like, Gordon."
02:16:30.549,02:16:34.452,Then you can look me in the eye and tell me you're sorry.
02:16:36.254,02:16:39.724,-You're not going to hurt my family. -No.
02:16:39.858,02:16:42.627,Just the person you love most.
02:16:50.635,02:16:53.672,So is it your wife?
02:16:54.739,02:16:56.474,"Put the gun down, Harvey."
02:16:56.775,02:16:58.510,"Harvey, put down the gun."
02:16:58.643,02:17:02.280,"Please. Please, Harvey. Please."
02:17:03.582,02:17:04.816,"Oh, goddamn it."
02:17:04.950,02:17:07.285,Will you stop pointing that gun at my family?
02:17:07.686,02:17:09.421,BARBARA: No! -We have a winner.
02:17:09.554,02:17:10.956,"No, Jim, stop him!"
02:17:11.556,02:17:14.659,GORDON: Harvey. BARBARA: Don't let him-- Harvey!
02:17:15.961,02:17:17.862,I'm sorry!
02:17:19.698,02:17:20.765,For everything.
02:17:23.435,02:17:25.604,Please don't hurt my son.
02:17:35.714,02:17:37.382,You brought your cops?
02:17:37.515,02:17:40.418,All they know is there's a situation.
02:17:40.552,02:17:43.555,They don't know who or what. They're just creating a perimeter.
02:17:43.688,02:17:46.424,You think I wanna escape from this?
02:17:46.558,02:17:49.361,There is no escape from this.
02:17:49.494,02:17:51.596,"You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey."
02:17:53.832,02:17:57.002,"It's not about what I want, it's about what's fair!"
02:17:57.802,02:18:01.973,You thought we could be decent men in an indecent time.
02:18:04.809,02:18:05.877,But you were wrong.
02:18:06.645,02:18:10.482,The world is cruel. And the only morality in a cruel world...
02:18:11.283,02:18:13.018,...is chance.
02:18:13.351,02:18:14.919,Unbiased.
02:18:15.287,02:18:16.488,Unprejudiced.
02:18:17.789,02:18:18.890,Fair.
02:18:19.024,02:18:21.426,His son's got the same chance she had.
02:18:22.027,02:18:23.461,Fifty-fifty.
02:18:23.595,02:18:26.965,What happened to Rachel wasn't chance. We decided to act.
02:18:27.432,02:18:28.700,We three.
02:18:28.833,02:18:32.370,Then why was it me who was the only one who lost everything?
02:18:34.773,02:18:37.475,-It wasn't. -The Joker chose me.
02:18:37.609,02:18:39.844,Because you were the best of us.
02:18:39.978,02:18:44.983,He wanted to prove that even someone as good as you...
02:18:45.317,02:18:46.918,...could fall.
02:18:47.385,02:18:48.620,And he was right.
02:18:48.753,02:18:50.955,"You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey."
02:18:51.089,02:18:54.326,So point it at the people responsible.
02:18:55.093,02:18:56.961,Fair enough.
02:19:00.432,02:19:02.334,You first.
02:19:14.746,02:19:16.481,My turn.
02:19:23.421,02:19:25.423,"Harvey, you're right."
02:19:26.458,02:19:28.960,Rachel's death was my fault.
02:19:32.030,02:19:34.599,Please don't punish the boy.
02:19:35.667,02:19:38.837,"-Please, punish me. -I'm about to."
02:19:40.805,02:19:42.774,"Tell your boy he's gonna be all right, Gordon."
02:19:43.141,02:19:44.843,Lie...
02:19:45.443,02:19:46.544,...like I lied.
02:19:50.148,02:19:51.816,"It's going to be all right, son."
02:20:30.155,02:20:33.024,"Dad? Daddy, is he okay?"
02:20:49.641,02:20:51.776,-Thank you. -You don't have to thank me.
02:20:52.477,02:20:54.112,"Yes, I do."
02:20:58.516,02:20:59.784,The Joker won.
02:21:02.120,02:21:05.023,"Harvey's prosecution, everything he fought for..."
02:21:05.657,02:21:07.459,...undone.
02:21:07.859,02:21:12.797,Whatever chance you gave us at fixing our city dies with Harvey's reputation.
02:21:12.931,02:21:14.065,We bet it all on him.
02:21:15.533,02:21:18.236,The Joker took the best of us and tore him down.
02:21:18.903,02:21:20.238,People will lose hope.
02:21:20.572,02:21:22.173,They won't.
02:21:24.776,02:21:26.678,They must never know what he did.
02:21:26.811,02:21:28.680,Five dead.
02:21:28.913,02:21:32.851,-Two of them cops. You can't sweep that-- -No.
02:21:37.689,02:21:40.558,But the Joker cannot win.
02:21:45.763,02:21:48.933,Gotham needs its true hero.
02:21:55.240,02:21:58.276,-No. -You either die a hero...
02:21:58.610,02:22:02.981,...or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
02:22:03.114,02:22:04.983,I can do those things...
02:22:05.517,02:22:08.553,"...because I'm not a hero, not like Dent."
02:22:11.556,02:22:14.259,I killed those people. That's what I can be.
02:22:14.592,02:22:16.528,"No, no, you can't. You're not."
02:22:16.661,02:22:19.130,I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.
02:22:20.865,02:22:21.966,Call it in.
02:22:25.203,02:22:27.005,GORDON: A hero.
02:22:27.138,02:22:30.542,"Not the hero we deserved, but the hero we needed."
02:22:31.009,02:22:33.645,Nothing less than a knight...
02:22:34.078,02:22:35.847,...shining.
02:22:36.548,02:22:38.049,GORDON: They'll hunt you.
02:22:38.182,02:22:40.018,BATMAN: You'll hunt me.
02:22:40.618,02:22:42.587,You'll condemn me.
02:22:43.154,02:22:45.590,Set the dogs on me.
02:22:49.193,02:22:51.629,Because that's what needs to happen.
02:22:52.764,02:22:54.699,Because sometimes...
02:22:54.832,02:22:56.968,...the truth isn't good enough.
02:22:57.869,02:23:00.104,Sometimes people deserve more.
02:23:03.675,02:23:07.612,Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded.
02:23:25.930,02:23:27.665,JAMES: Batman.
02:23:29.601,02:23:31.202,Batman!
02:23:32.036,02:23:34.005,"Why's he running, Dad?"
02:23:35.039,02:23:36.307,Because we have to chase him.
02:23:36.641,02:23:39.344,"Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!"
02:23:45.617,02:23:47.085,He didn't do anything wrong.
02:23:49.887,02:23:55.360,"Because he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now."
02:23:56.894,02:23:57.929,So we'll hunt him...
02:24:01.032,02:24:03.101,...because he can take it.
02:24:05.703,02:24:08.106,Because he's not our hero.
02:24:15.747,02:24:16.914,He's a silent guardian...
02:24:18.049,02:24:19.951,...a watchful protector.
02:24:22.353,02:24:23.788,A dark knight.
