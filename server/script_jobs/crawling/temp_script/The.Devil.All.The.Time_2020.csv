00:01:06.833,00:01:09.458,they probably couldn't point 'em out to you on a map.
00:01:11.458,00:01:14.125,"But I guarantee, they'd be there all the same."
00:01:17.083,00:01:25.000,How and why so many people from those two piddlin' places on that map could end up connected has a lot to do with our story.
00:01:26.625,00:01:31.416,"Some would claim it was just dumb luck, while others might swear it was God's intention."
00:01:32.083,00:01:36.916,"But I'd say with the way things turned out, it was a little bit of both."
00:01:39.291,00:01:48.208,"In 1957, it'd take someone approximately ten hours to drive from Coal Creek to a paper mill town in southern Ohio called Meade."
00:01:48.750,00:01:53.291,"Once you got to Meade, Knockemstiff was only a short drive away."
00:02:02.125,00:02:15.750,"Four hundred or so people lived in Knockemstiff in 1957, nearly all of them connected by blood by one godforsaken calamity or another, be it lust or necessity or just plain ignorance."
00:02:20.541,00:02:25.125,The Russells had rented the house on top of the Mitchell flats for nine years now.
00:02:25.666,00:02:29.416,But most of the neighbors down below still considered them outsiders.
00:02:44.916,00:02:50.000,a weathered cross above a fallen tree in a small clearing behind his house.
00:02:51.000,00:02:54.041,He came every morning and evening to talk to God.
00:02:54.458,00:02:58.458,It seemed to his son that his father fought the Devil all the time.
00:03:01.625,00:03:02.791,what happened today.
00:03:03.291,00:03:05.208,"Now, remember, be honest."
00:03:05.750,00:03:07.625,"No bullshittin', he'll know."
00:03:11.208,00:03:21.333,his mind would often drift back to the war in the South Pacific and the day that he and a couple of other soldiers came across the body of Gunnery Sergeant Miller Jones.
00:04:02.500,00:04:03.583,Miller Jones.
00:04:51.958,00:04:53.791,-Please. -Thank you.
00:04:58.000,00:05:01.333,the man whose seat he took would also meet his match.
00:05:01.750,00:05:03.625,I'm so sorry. I forgot my damn keys.
00:05:03.708,00:05:05.333,Okay. Guy by the window counter.
00:05:09.750,00:05:11.375,"So, what'll you be having?"
00:05:13.500,00:05:14.708,Ham and cheese.
00:05:18.958,00:05:20.708,-Okay. -You're a little green on the job.
00:05:22.583,00:05:24.458,"My brother just got me the job, so..."
00:05:25.500,00:05:26.708,Ham and cheese.
00:05:29.166,00:05:30.083,You take pictures?
00:05:33.833,00:05:35.583,and she'd called him the shooter.
00:05:35.666,00:05:39.500,"Only when I find a smile pretty enough to photograph, that is."
00:05:41.833,00:05:43.000,I'll have to think about it.
00:05:46.625,00:05:48.500,Meatloaf is the blue plate special.
00:05:50.458,00:05:53.458,Um-- Just coffee and a doughnut.
00:06:09.833,00:06:11.000,No!
00:06:11.083,00:06:13.416,"-Get out. I told you last time. -Come on, now."
00:06:17.666,00:06:19.666,I'm just gonna take my break outside.
00:06:46.208,00:06:47.875,Did you need anything else?
00:06:48.375,00:06:49.541,"Um... No, I'm fine."
00:06:57.125,00:06:59.541,"That was nice, what you did."
00:07:00.250,00:07:02.833,Some people just need a little help once in a while.
00:07:03.333,00:07:04.416,You know what I mean?
00:07:06.333,00:07:07.250,Yep.
00:07:11.291,00:07:13.083,-Hmm. -You back home from the war?
00:07:14.208,00:07:15.708,"Nah, I'm just passing through."
00:07:16.791,00:07:18.250,On my way to West Virginia.
00:07:19.125,00:07:20.625,My people are from Coal Creek.
00:07:23.375,00:07:24.458,That's too bad.
00:07:25.958,00:07:27.291,You have a nice face.
00:07:37.750,00:07:38.958,It's nice to meet you.
00:07:41.875,00:07:43.250,"It's nice to meet you, too."
00:08:03.916,00:08:05.958,-I got three more in my kit. -Yeah?
00:08:06.041,00:08:09.083,"Yep. And I've got something else for you, Uncle Earskell."
00:08:11.291,00:08:17.875,"Now, this here is supposed to be the gun that Hitler used to blow his brains out."
00:08:27.625,00:08:29.416,"That is a nice gift, though."
00:08:30.250,00:08:31.500,-Yeah. -Thank you.
00:08:32.000,00:08:33.083,It's German.
00:08:33.166,00:08:34.458,That's a Luger.
00:08:50.208,00:08:51.583,It wasn't that bad.
00:08:52.875,00:08:54.208,"It wasn't that bad, Mama."
00:08:57.583,00:09:04.208,"I would ask you to get down and thank Jesus with me, but I can smell the liquor on your breath."
00:09:04.291,00:09:05.416,I know.
00:09:06.166,00:09:07.958,I felt the need to celebrate.
00:09:09.250,00:09:10.166,I'm in love.
00:09:13.958,00:09:15.625,"Well, I ain't never got her name."
00:09:18.958,00:09:20.291,You ain't got her name?
00:09:21.750,00:09:23.833,"I left her a dollar tip, though."
00:09:25.083,00:09:26.541,For a cup of coffee?
00:09:32.666,00:09:37.625,"Oh, but there's a-- a girl from church I want you to meet."
00:09:50.666,00:09:54.833,"without thinking of Miller Jones, he never told anyone about the crucified Marine."
00:09:59.166,00:10:01.958,"Willard, I've asked Helen to sit with us. Go on, Helen."
00:10:06.708,00:10:08.416,"Willard just got back, Helen."
00:10:08.500,00:10:09.791,-You-- -Welcome home.
00:10:13.083,00:10:14.291,It's been four days.
00:10:17.291,00:10:22.250,"that in exchange for bringing him home safe, she'd make sure he married Helen Hatton."
00:10:22.916,00:10:27.958,The girl's family burned up in a house fire leaving the poor thing all alone.
00:10:30.041,00:10:31.250,"It's hot, ain't it?"
00:10:33.541,00:10:41.375,"Right now, we got two boys from over in Topperville And from what folks tell me, they got a right good message."
00:10:41.916,00:10:44.208,"So, let's bring 'em up. Boys, come on up here."
00:10:49.458,00:10:51.291,See that one in the wheelchair?
00:10:51.375,00:10:54.541,"Drank too much strychnine or antifreeze, or something is why he can't walk."
00:10:54.625,00:10:57.000,So good to see you. Thank you for coming.
00:10:57.083,00:10:58.750,"Testing their fate, they call it."
00:10:59.250,00:11:01.583,"It's going too far, the way I see it."
00:11:04.916,00:11:06.083,"Thank you, Reverend."
00:11:08.250,00:11:12.666,"My name is Roy Laferty, and this here is my cousin, Theodore."
00:11:16.666,00:11:21.958,"Now, the Holy Ghost is going to visit this little church that bears his sacred name!"
00:12:11.916,00:12:12.916,Whoo!
00:12:18.791,00:12:19.625,Hmm?
00:12:20.750,00:12:23.208,"Because if your worst fear is rats, well.."
00:12:24.625,00:12:27.250,Satan'll make sure you get your fill of them. Mm.
00:12:31.083,00:12:37.125,"you'll see them, eating away at you whilst you lay there unable to lift a single finger."
00:12:38.166,00:12:39.833,And it won't ever cease.
00:12:40.833,00:12:44.166,A million years in eternity.
00:12:46.708,00:12:48.666,"Now, don't even try and figure that up."
00:12:50.125,00:12:53.666,Ain't no human head big enough to calculate misery like that!
00:12:55.875,00:13:01.541,"And really, brothers and sisters, ain't no man ever been evil enough, -not even that Hitler fella... -That's right."
00:13:01.625,00:13:09.666,"...come up with the ways Satan's gonna make them sinners pay Yeah! Yes, that's right, my friends!"
00:13:12.583,00:13:13.541,Amen.
00:13:16.500,00:13:18.291,"Let me tell you something, friends."
00:13:20.666,00:13:22.583,Before I found the Holy Ghost...
00:13:25.458,00:13:28.125,I was scared plumb to death of spiders.
00:13:30.125,00:13:32.500,"-Ain't that right, Theodore? -Mm-hmm."
00:13:39.375,00:13:44.458,"hiding under my mother's long skirts, spiders crawling through my dreams..."
00:13:45.541,00:13:47.208,...laying eggs in my nightmares.
00:13:48.916,00:13:49.916,They was...
00:13:50.583,00:13:52.708,hang in their webs everywhere...
00:13:54.041,00:13:55.000,waitin'.
00:13:56.291,00:14:00.416,"I had fear in me all the time, awake or asleep, didn't matter."
00:14:00.500,00:14:03.083,"Now, that's what hell is like, brothers and sisters!"
00:14:09.041,00:14:12.708,Not until the Lord gave me strength!
00:14:14.375,00:14:16.000,Brothers and sisters...
00:14:20.541,00:14:22.083,...behold!
00:14:23.416,00:14:25.958,The Lord looks out for me now!
00:14:33.583,00:14:35.541,"Mark my word, people!"
00:14:36.250,00:14:40.250,The Spirit will take away your fears if you're willing!
00:14:43.708,00:14:45.708,I ain't gonna sleep tonight as it is.
00:14:47.416,00:14:49.541,I wish Helen left with us.
00:14:51.625,00:14:55.958,"Well, she might have come with us, if you'd paid her a little more attention."
00:14:58.166,00:15:00.750,The right man would make a good life for Helen.
00:15:04.791,00:15:07.083,if she couldn't keep her promise to God.
00:15:09.708,00:15:13.000,"Helen did, in fact, meet the man she would marry that afternoon."
00:15:13.083,00:15:14.708,"Bless me, Reverend."
00:15:14.791,00:15:15.958,Bless me.
00:15:18.500,00:15:21.250,And Willard's mind was already hundreds of miles away.
00:15:27.666,00:15:28.916,Be right there.
00:15:30.500,00:15:31.666,I ain't no rush.
00:15:33.958,00:15:36.375,"-Why, if it isn't-- -I never got your name."
00:15:39.500,00:15:40.916,"Be right back with you, hon."
00:15:55.875,00:15:59.208,"I own a few of these properties around Meade, Knockemstiff."
00:16:00.958,00:16:02.500,Real long-term investments.
00:16:02.583,00:16:05.291,"There aren't any sinks in here, Mr. Dunlap."
00:16:16.541,00:16:17.916,"What do you think, Arvin?"
00:16:57.166,00:17:02.416,not a single petition or word of praise since he'd come across the crucified Marine.
00:17:03.041,00:17:11.166,"Willard could feel it welling up inside him now, the urge to get right with his maker before something bad happened to his family."
00:17:28.166,00:17:29.583,Where'd you go?
00:17:29.666,00:17:31.375,I was just looking the land over.
00:17:32.375,00:17:33.458,What you think?
00:17:39.416,00:17:41.291,Rent seems fair for what we get.
00:17:42.625,00:17:45.625,"We keep saving, we could probably buy it."
00:17:48.500,00:17:50.333,Arvin have a home of his own.
00:17:52.125,00:17:53.625,I never did have that.
00:17:56.208,00:17:59.333,We found a place in a holler called Knockemstiff.
00:18:05.083,00:18:07.291,We're saving money to buy the house one day.
00:18:07.875,00:18:09.958,So things are gonna be tight for a while.
00:18:10.875,00:18:12.916,We'll get to you as soon as possible.
00:18:14.458,00:18:16.458,"Your son, Willard."
00:18:19.041,00:18:19.875,P.S...
00:18:21.666,00:18:23.291,I got the urge to pray again.
00:18:27.083,00:18:31.125,We'll get to you as soon as possible. Your son Willard.
00:18:32.291,00:18:35.166,P.S. I got the urge to pray again.
00:18:42.250,00:18:45.250,Don't mind. Hand her over here. Where y'all going?
00:18:59.291,00:19:03.916,"Seven years later, they found Helen's body buried in the woods."
00:19:04.875,00:19:06.375,I'm thinking we take a walk.
00:19:07.500,00:19:09.791,Be fine to pray outside and adore them trees.
00:19:11.208,00:19:13.750,"Whatever you want, Roy, but what about Theodore?"
00:19:14.541,00:19:16.791,Theodore will be all right sitting in the car.
00:19:16.875,00:19:19.500,That's right. Don't y'all worry about me.
00:19:20.666,00:19:22.625,Maybe I oughta take me a nap.
00:19:24.958,00:19:26.666,"Just be you and me, sweetheart."
00:19:45.416,00:19:48.208,Arvin Eugene Russell was nine years old.
00:19:49.083,00:19:53.000,He was the only kid on the school bus who wasn't somebody's relation.
00:19:54.833,00:19:57.958,"Three days before, he'd come home with another black eye."
00:19:59.125,00:20:01.250,"You're coming out back with me today, boy."
00:20:06.500,00:20:08.500,"You got a deposit to make, sir?"
00:20:13.708,00:20:16.666,Those little shits keep picking on him. It ain't right.
00:20:19.416,00:20:21.125,Them boys might be bigger than you.
00:20:21.208,00:20:25.083,"But the next time one of them starts his shit, I want you to finish it."
00:20:25.166,00:20:26.375,You understand?
00:20:26.458,00:20:27.541,"Yes, sir."
00:20:35.625,00:20:37.541,"Now, you pray on what happened today."
00:20:39.666,00:20:42.958,"And remember, be honest, no bullshittin'."
00:20:43.750,00:20:44.750,He'll know.
00:21:12.791,00:21:15.750,"Shit, I'm thinking now'd be a good time to pay his old lady a visit."
00:21:17.333,00:21:20.541,"This here's the Lord's time, not nobody else's."
00:21:27.583,00:21:30.583,"Come on, you dumb son of a bitch. This thing's getting heavy."
00:21:40.000,00:21:42.666,the two poachers didn't head to his home that day.
00:22:21.916,00:22:24.500,No sense in you napping in here like a house cat all day.
00:22:24.583,00:22:27.208,"-Get off the couch, Jack. -Can Jack come?"
00:22:33.625,00:22:35.000,Will you get me some sugar?
00:22:59.000,00:23:00.083,Roll up your window.
00:23:40.416,00:23:43.166,"-Stubbs! -Stubbs, get out here, man!"
00:23:43.916,00:23:45.875,"-Get out of here! -Come on, give me a hand."
00:23:45.958,00:23:47.375,Get the fuck out of here!
00:23:59.500,00:24:01.208,Now you remember what I told you?
00:24:02.375,00:24:04.500,About them boys on the bus that gave you the black eye?
00:24:05.791,00:24:07.041,That's what I meant.
00:24:11.208,00:24:12.166,"Yes, sir."
00:24:12.833,00:24:14.958,There's a lot of no good sons of bitches out there.
00:24:20.750,00:24:22.333,"Yeah, at least that many."
00:24:27.375,00:24:29.333,"How about I buy you a candy bar, huh?"
00:24:31.125,00:24:33.666,We gotta get some sugar for Mama too.
00:24:37.583,00:24:40.125,as the best one he ever spent with his father.
00:24:40.708,00:24:43.291,"So what kind of candy bar you gonna get, huh?"
00:24:43.375,00:24:45.958,"Um... a Charleston Chew, yeah."
00:24:46.916,00:24:47.833,Mama?
00:24:49.000,00:24:49.916,Mama?
00:24:51.000,00:24:51.958,Mama?
00:24:57.083,00:24:58.083,Dad!
00:25:03.541,00:25:06.291,Listen to me. Charlotte!
00:25:18.416,00:25:21.000,The morphine will continue to dampen the pain but...
00:25:21.541,00:25:23.666,there's no way we can destroy that cancer.
00:25:44.375,00:25:47.875,Now... them doctors can't do your mom any good.
00:25:51.458,00:25:52.291,But He can save her.
00:25:53.791,00:25:56.166,"Yeah, if we just pray hard enough."
00:25:58.625,00:26:04.458,The Lord can do anything Okay?
00:26:05.333,00:26:06.500,Now hold them tight.
00:26:07.208,00:26:08.625,And pray like you mean it.
00:26:16.291,00:26:19.625,"Lord, please save my wife."
00:26:21.916,00:26:24.666,"Destroy this cancer inside her, Lord."
00:26:26.458,00:26:28.458,"We need your help, Lord."
00:26:29.541,00:26:33.041,"We need your help, and I know you can do it."
00:26:34.000,00:26:35.458,I know you can do it.
00:26:35.541,00:26:37.583,"Please Lord, please."
00:26:41.083,00:26:42.375,"Pray, God dammit."
00:26:43.250,00:26:45.708,"-You want your mama to die? -No, sir."
00:26:45.791,00:26:46.750,Then pray!
00:26:49.541,00:26:52.416,"Lord, please save my mama!"
00:26:59.166,00:27:01.833,"Now you pray, now! You hear me?"
00:27:01.916,00:27:02.958,"Yes, Lord!"
00:27:03.041,00:27:04.541,"Save my mama, Lord!"
00:27:05.041,00:27:07.250,Please clean the cancer inside of her!
00:27:08.458,00:27:11.250,"And don't be crying, you hear? Don't be crying!"
00:27:14.875,00:27:15.875,Spare my wife!
00:27:25.250,00:27:26.666,Don't take her from me.
00:27:57.916,00:28:00.041,Everything's gonna be okay.
00:28:00.125,00:28:01.458,God'll hear us.
00:28:02.541,00:28:04.041,And he'll take care of Mama.
00:28:05.916,00:28:07.083,"You good, honey."
00:28:14.291,00:28:15.541,I'm fine.
00:28:35.125,00:28:37.625,than just his prayers and sincerity.
00:28:40.000,00:28:45.750,God had a tendency of asking men to make sacrifices in order to prove their faith.
00:29:08.375,00:29:10.000,"Dad, no!"
00:29:10.875,00:29:15.083,"Dad, no!"
00:29:15.166,00:29:16.125,Dad!
00:29:16.208,00:29:19.791,"Lord, this here is my boy's dog."
00:29:20.291,00:29:21.375,We loved him.
00:29:22.208,00:29:23.625,He loved him.
00:29:29.583,00:29:31.000,Now you take him!
00:29:31.083,00:29:32.541,Bring him back!
00:29:32.625,00:29:34.041,You save Charlotte!
00:29:35.875,00:29:37.458,"It's gonna be all right, Arvin."
00:29:38.291,00:29:39.666,It's gonna be all right.
00:30:07.041,00:30:09.333,Go down and visit your grandma in Coal Creek.
00:30:11.916,00:30:13.916,You can meet Uncle Earskell.
00:30:15.041,00:30:17.041,And that girl that's living with them...
00:30:17.875,00:30:19.750,She's just a little younger than you.
00:30:19.833,00:30:22.083,Maybe we'll stay for a while.
00:30:52.875,00:30:54.250,When Dad goes to sleep...
00:30:55.458,00:30:58.333,I'm going to bring you down and give you a proper burial.
00:30:59.458,00:31:01.083,Just like they gave to Mama.
00:31:23.416,00:31:26.166,"I'm not doing that no more, you hear me?"
00:31:26.833,00:31:28.125,I ain't prayin'!
00:31:29.416,00:31:30.333,You hear me?
00:31:31.583,00:31:33.375,I said I'm not doing that no more.
00:31:47.791,00:31:50.666,There's money to be made if a man of the law is careful and...
00:31:51.333,00:31:52.750,doesn't get a big head.
00:31:54.083,00:31:56.416,"I wanna get out of my house, Lee."
00:31:57.250,00:32:00.833,"I told you, sweetie, it's only matter of time."
00:32:01.708,00:32:03.458,And no more parking lots.
00:32:04.125,00:32:07.125,No more Pepsi cups. Just a big ole bed.
00:32:08.208,00:32:09.041,Yeah.
00:32:09.125,00:32:11.125,People like me in this town.
00:32:11.916,00:32:13.791,"-You know that, honey. -Mm-hmm."
00:32:13.875,00:32:14.791,Yeah.
00:32:15.625,00:32:17.416,I'll get myself elected.
00:32:20.208,00:32:21.125,Get a...
00:32:21.750,00:32:24.208,-cushy place up in Brewer Heights. -Mm-hmm.
00:32:25.041,00:32:26.208,You see them...
00:32:39.333,00:32:41.125,-You get it all in the cup? -Yeah.
00:32:48.750,00:32:51.125,Deputy Bodecker around those parts?
00:32:51.750,00:32:54.958,We got a call from Hank over at-- -Fuck. -Can you get over and check that out?
00:32:55.041,00:32:57.250,-Can I come with you? -Are you crazy?
00:32:57.333,00:32:59.666,-Come on. -Didn't you hear anything I said?
00:32:59.750,00:33:01.333,I've got an election to think about.
00:33:14.916,00:33:18.666,Better not be one of them goddamn window peepers you keep calling about.
00:33:22.458,00:33:23.583,"Well, what is it, son?"
00:33:25.333,00:33:26.208,He's dead.
00:33:26.708,00:33:28.875,And they buried his poor mama today.
00:33:29.500,00:33:30.958,"It's a damn shame, it is."
00:33:31.583,00:33:33.000,Is that blood on your face?
00:33:35.416,00:33:37.125,Somebody left us a pie.
00:33:45.916,00:33:47.166,What's that smell?
00:33:50.291,00:33:51.458,"God dammit, boy."
00:33:53.750,00:33:54.875,What the hell is this?
00:33:55.125,00:33:56.416,It's a prayer log.
00:33:57.291,00:33:58.125,Prayer log?
00:33:58.625,00:33:59.500,Yeah.
00:34:00.833,00:34:02.416,But it don't work too good.
00:34:08.000,00:34:09.458,"Mama's coming, Lenora."
00:34:21.625,00:34:22.625,Your dinner's ready.
00:34:29.666,00:34:30.708,Lord!
00:34:31.375,00:34:32.958,-Speak! -Roy?
00:34:35.666,00:34:36.958,I've been thinking...
00:34:39.333,00:34:42.125,Maybe the Lord wants you to come out into the light.
00:34:45.541,00:34:49.291,"I mean, how can you be close to God stuck in there?"
00:34:51.458,00:34:53.166,The Lord don't like dark places.
00:34:59.125,00:34:59.958,Roy?
00:35:04.125,00:35:06.625,and his head had puffed up as big as a pumpkin.
00:35:06.708,00:35:07.833,"All right, then."
00:35:10.458,00:35:11.750,Enjoy your dinner.
00:35:15.166,00:35:20.291,he'd become convinced that the Lord was testing him to see if he was ready to take on something bigger.
00:35:21.416,00:35:25.208,He'd stayed in the dark closet for a fortnight waiting on an answer.
00:35:26.125,00:35:28.875,He smelled worse than a truck-stop shitter.
00:35:45.708,00:35:48.125,"Oh, no, I'm not scared!"
00:35:52.916,00:35:56.625,"I hear you! Yes, I am here!"
00:35:57.791,00:36:01.666,"Helen. Oh, it's so good to see you, honey."
00:36:01.750,00:36:04.750,"-Been a while, ain't it? -Is everything all right?"
00:36:04.833,00:36:06.333,"Oh, everything's fine now."
00:36:06.875,00:36:09.250,"Uh, Roy finally got himself straightened out."
00:36:10.125,00:36:12.750,"Well, that's good to hear."
00:36:24.333,00:36:27.333,Don't mind. Hand her over here. Where y'all going?
00:36:36.833,00:36:37.791,Yes.
00:36:56.958,00:36:59.666,"This spot looks about as good a place as any, don't it?"
00:37:00.916,00:37:01.833,Yes.
00:37:06.875,00:37:08.416,"The Lord is here, sweetheart."
00:37:08.958,00:37:10.000,I can feel him.
00:37:18.583,00:37:19.958,"God loves you, Helen."
00:37:46.375,00:37:47.291,Lenora...
00:38:33.833,00:38:34.750,God...
00:38:37.666,00:38:39.083,I've heard your word.
00:38:44.583,00:38:45.583,Helen...
00:38:48.000,00:38:49.333,I resurrect you...
00:38:55.750,00:38:58.583,with the grace of God in me...
00:39:00.875,00:39:02.375,I resurrect you!
00:39:05.250,00:39:06.375,Return!
00:39:16.166,00:39:17.250,God!
00:39:19.041,00:39:20.333,It is time!
00:39:24.333,00:39:26.083,Resurrect! Return!
00:39:31.208,00:39:34.125,"Return, Spirit! Resurrect!"
00:39:38.375,00:39:39.375,God!
00:39:44.708,00:39:45.958,God!
00:39:47.375,00:39:48.625,Resurrect!
00:39:51.875,00:39:53.125,"Come on, now!"
00:39:54.916,00:40:03.916,"Come on, now, res-- I could tell the police what happened."
00:40:05.458,00:40:06.750,That it was an accident.
00:40:12.416,00:40:15.416,Tried to bring her back from the dead and then buried her body.
00:40:17.208,00:40:19.166,"That ain't an accident, Roy."
00:40:20.125,00:40:22.708,That sounds like a crazy person who killed his wife.
00:40:28.083,00:40:29.333,Keep driving south.
00:40:30.750,00:40:33.750,"If we stay off highways, we should be fine."
00:40:58.625,00:40:59.500,Roy?
00:41:07.708,00:41:08.583,Roy?
00:41:12.083,00:41:12.916,Roy?
00:41:19.458,00:41:20.958,"C-Coal Creek, West Virginia."
00:41:21.041,00:41:22.791,"We'll get you close enough, son."
00:41:23.500,00:41:25.375,"I'm Carl, by the way, this here's Sandy."
00:41:26.166,00:41:27.791,Huh? Ain't she somethin'?
00:41:29.583,00:41:31.541,"Mister, I do appreciate this."
00:41:31.625,00:41:34.708,I don't understand people that won't pick up strangers.
00:41:34.791,00:41:37.125,"It should be a good thing, helping someone out."
00:41:37.208,00:41:38.458,You sound like a Christian.
00:41:38.541,00:41:40.500,Carl used to teach at Sunday school.
00:41:40.583,00:41:41.750,"Didn't you, babe?"
00:41:41.833,00:41:42.750,That's right.
00:41:43.583,00:41:44.666,That's right.
00:41:47.458,00:41:48.625,"What's your name, sweetie?"
00:41:49.500,00:41:50.333,It's Roy.
00:41:51.333,00:41:52.708,Roy Laferty.
00:41:52.791,00:41:54.708,"So what's in West Virginia, Roy?"
00:41:55.416,00:41:57.166,Going back home to see my daughter.
00:42:01.750,00:42:03.291,"Hey, come on."
00:42:04.666,00:42:06.041,I wanna show you something.
00:42:21.541,00:42:22.625,What?
00:42:22.708,00:42:25.041,"I'm giving you a good thing here, buddy."
00:42:25.125,00:42:26.000,Come on.
00:42:35.666,00:42:37.875,"Said I'm giving you a good thing here, buddy."
00:42:39.750,00:42:43.458,I wanna get some shots of your ugly old mug sitting next to a pretty lady.
00:42:44.625,00:42:48.250,"Come on, she likes lanky old studs like yourself. Come on."
00:42:52.083,00:42:53.958,"What's going on here, mister?"
00:42:54.041,00:42:56.500,"Oh, come on, Jesus Christ, huh?"
00:42:57.833,00:43:03.125,"Pay attention. It's like I said, you're gonna fuck my wife and I'm gonna take some pictures, that's all."
00:43:04.791,00:43:05.708,Your wife?
00:43:06.916,00:43:07.791,Come on.
00:43:09.208,00:43:11.125,I've never heard of such a thing.
00:43:12.041,00:43:16.666,"I thought you was a good Christian-- Shut the fuck up and get that welfare suit off, son."
00:43:18.083,00:43:20.625,"-Jesus. -Well, I've been run through the wringer!"
00:43:22.458,00:43:24.625,Do you really want these hands touching you?
00:43:24.708,00:43:25.791,"Oh, come on, sweetie."
00:43:25.875,00:43:29.625,We'll just take a few pictures and then the big dumb bastard will leave us alone.
00:43:29.708,00:43:32.458,Woman... look at me.
00:43:44.625,00:43:45.583,"No, I ain't."
00:43:57.541,00:43:59.916,"Carl, maybe we should just get out of here."
00:44:01.375,00:44:02.416,"Oh, forget it. Jesus."
00:44:06.916,00:44:10.583,"if that's what death would be like, just floating away in the air."
00:44:13.083,00:44:16.541,"He preached on it for years, but still didn't know what to expect."
00:44:18.125,00:44:19.541,Just one thing.
00:44:20.041,00:44:21.125,"Yeah, what's that?"
00:44:22.250,00:44:23.833,Her name is Lenora.
00:44:25.500,00:44:27.125,What the fuck you talking about?
00:44:29.958,00:44:30.958,My little girl.
00:44:44.125,00:44:46.541,and Carl was still working out the particulars.
00:44:47.666,00:44:53.208,He realized that he would have to get more selective with his models if he wanted to keep Sandy onboard.
00:45:10.458,00:45:12.000,-You Emma Russell? -Yes.
00:45:17.666,00:45:18.833,"Here, let me have that."
00:45:31.250,00:45:33.291,"Here, you give me that heavy old bag."
00:45:47.416,00:45:51.208,"Oh, sweetie, we are so happy you're here."
00:45:54.041,00:45:55.291,This here is your...
00:45:55.958,00:45:57.416,your Uncle Earskell.
00:45:57.916,00:45:58.791,"Hey, there."
00:45:59.958,00:46:02.083,This is Lenora.
00:46:03.750,00:46:05.875,Lenora is your stepsister.
00:46:06.500,00:46:07.541,"Hi, Arvin."
00:46:10.291,00:46:11.125,Hi.
00:46:53.333,00:46:55.291,Happy birthday.
00:46:59.416,00:47:00.333,All right.
00:47:10.791,00:47:13.041,"-Arvin! -All right, hang on."
00:47:26.916,00:47:27.750,Well...
00:47:28.708,00:47:30.250,This was your daddy's.
00:47:53.666,00:47:55.416,I figure it's time to pass it on.
00:47:56.875,00:47:58.250,That's a German Luger.
00:47:59.416,00:48:01.083,Brought back from the war.
00:48:02.916,00:48:06.083,I... got no use for handguns myself.
00:48:06.166,00:48:08.166,But I figure he'd want you to have it.
00:48:20.500,00:48:22.375,Shotgun's what'll do you good.
00:48:24.000,00:48:26.500,"Maybe, but I don't have anything else of his, so..."
00:48:31.125,00:48:32.666,Time does pass.
00:48:40.333,00:48:41.625,and pinched face.
00:48:50.166,00:48:53.541,had managed to corner her by the dumpster behind school.
00:49:18.833,00:49:23.750,"No matter what the weather was, Lenora would visit her mother's grave after school."
00:49:24.708,00:49:29.166,"Some days she'd even read the Bible out loud, and imagine her mother was listening."
00:49:30.250,00:49:35.166,Though he wasn't one for praying Arvin would often drive her and keep her company.
00:49:44.875,00:49:47.500,It was a sight you didn't end up in the hospital.
00:49:52.583,00:49:56.250,"Well, Lord, Arvin, you've been saying that almost since the day I met you."
00:49:56.875,00:49:58.625,"You know, that's because it's true."
00:50:00.708,00:50:03.875,Maybe you should try praying for 'em then. Would that hurt none?
00:50:05.500,00:50:09.333,"You already do enough for all of us, and where's it doing you much good, huh?"
00:50:10.500,00:50:12.125,You know what would do you good?
00:50:12.791,00:50:16.416,"To not be wandering behind school by your own self, like I told you."
00:50:18.083,00:50:19.625,Fuckin' Gene Dinwoodie.
00:50:23.750,00:50:25.208,Do you ever think about...
00:50:26.000,00:50:28.458,how we ended up orphans living in the same house?
00:50:30.625,00:50:31.583,No.
00:50:32.583,00:50:34.666,"Besides, you might not even be an orphan."
00:50:35.625,00:50:40.333,As far as everybody around here is concerned your daddy's probably still out there somewhere alive and kicking.
00:50:42.500,00:50:46.000,"Fuck, he might even come over that hill any day now, dancing a jig."
00:50:50.666,00:50:52.583,I pray every day he will.
00:50:53.916,00:50:55.625,Even if it means he did something?
00:50:56.250,00:50:58.083,I've already forgiven him.
00:50:58.583,00:50:59.500,Hm.
00:51:00.833,00:51:02.041,We could start over.
00:51:03.750,00:51:05.250,That's crazy.
00:51:05.333,00:51:06.458,"No, it's not."
00:51:11.125,00:51:12.291,What about your father?
00:51:16.083,00:51:17.208,What about him?
00:51:18.583,00:51:20.041,I know what my daddy did.
00:51:24.750,00:51:25.666,Well...
00:51:26.916,00:51:28.458,forgivin' him...
00:51:29.708,00:51:30.875,if he could come back.
00:51:30.958,00:51:33.791,"Well, shut your mouth. We both know that ain't never gonna happen."
00:51:35.250,00:51:36.875,I'm sorry for bringing it up.
00:51:40.208,00:51:43.875,"You know, I appreciate you always coming with me."
00:51:47.000,00:51:49.625,I know you'd probably rather be doing something else.
00:51:51.750,00:51:54.416,We're kin. We gotta look out for each other.
00:51:56.708,00:51:57.541,C'mere!
00:51:58.708,00:52:00.041,I might be gone a while.
00:52:02.125,00:52:03.416,I'll be praying for you.
00:52:09.666,00:52:13.875,my sister's boy from down in Tennessee is gonna come up and take my place.
00:52:15.250,00:52:17.333,He just graduated from one of them...
00:52:17.875,00:52:19.166,Bible colleges.
00:52:20.041,00:52:24.250,"Well, I would appreciate it if you all would try and make him feel welcome."
00:52:26.208,00:52:29.625,Tell your grandmama I'm asking folks to bring a dish next sermon.
00:52:34.000,00:52:39.583,Cliff Baker says he can get me on the crew laying blacktop on the Greenbrier stretch off Route 60.
00:52:40.666,00:52:42.541,I'm probably just gonna do that. You?
00:52:42.625,00:52:44.916,"Oh, my old man's holding me here."
00:52:45.000,00:52:48.000,Better than getting shipped off to Vietnam I expect.
00:52:48.500,00:52:49.708,"Yeah, I suppose so."
00:52:52.541,00:52:57.708,"they like the way I do them, but I-- Well, just get him a big steak then."
00:52:58.708,00:53:01.083,You know I can't afford anything like that.
00:53:02.083,00:53:05.166,"Grandma, quit worrying about it. He's just a preacher."
00:53:05.250,00:53:08.750,"Anyway, everyone says ain't no one doesn't like you, you know that."
00:53:09.208,00:53:10.625,So chicken livers it is.
00:53:26.625,00:53:28.500,"It's nice to meet you, Reverend."
00:53:33.500,00:53:36.166,"-Nice to meet you, Reverend. -Nice to meet you."
00:53:43.750,00:53:49.958,"When people praised her food, she always told them that she couldn't fry an egg until she found the Lord."
00:53:50.791,00:53:55.333,And that he was the one that guided her hand and made everything turn out good.
00:54:09.791,00:54:11.375,My heart's in my stomach.
00:54:12.166,00:54:13.708,That hat. You know better.
00:54:24.875,00:54:25.750,Hello there.
00:54:25.833,00:54:27.708,"Pleased to meet you, Reverend."
00:54:27.791,00:54:28.833,Emma Russell.
00:54:28.916,00:54:31.458,Nice to meet you too. What you got there?
00:54:41.666,00:54:46.791,"from the chicken livers around in his mouth, he felt the stirrings of a sermon coming on."
00:54:47.791,00:54:48.666,Blessed...
00:54:49.166,00:54:50.833,are they who hunger...
00:54:51.500,00:54:52.583,and thirst...
00:54:53.583,00:54:54.791,for righteousness.
00:55:01.125,00:55:02.583,"Hope you like them, Reverend."
00:55:06.666,00:55:08.041,and held onto every word.
00:55:12.833,00:55:14.208,that he was going to be a preacher.
00:55:15.166,00:55:20.250,"He'd never win a fist fight, but he could recite the Book of Revelation in his sleep."
00:55:34.083,00:55:35.375,Friends...
00:55:38.125,00:55:39.375,there's no doubt...
00:55:40.958,00:55:44.458,we're all humble people gathered here.
00:55:46.416,00:55:51.541,Y'all have been awful nice to me and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for the welcome.
00:55:54.166,00:55:55.166,But friends...
00:55:57.666,00:55:58.958,the poor soul...
00:55:59.416,00:56:02.291,that brung in them chicken livers on that beat-up plate...
00:56:04.041,00:56:07.291,let's just say I'm inspired to preach on it for a minute before we eat.
00:56:09.666,00:56:10.541,Sure...
00:56:11.541,00:56:14.000,some of us are better off than others.
00:56:15.000,00:56:16.250,And I see...
00:56:17.125,00:56:22.666,plenty of white meat and red meat laid out on this table.
00:56:23.750,00:56:31.125,And I suspect that the folks that carried them platters in But poor people...
00:56:32.291,00:56:35.166,got to bring what they can afford.
00:56:36.166,00:56:37.500,So them organs...
00:56:41.083,00:56:42.416,is a sign to me...
00:56:44.166,00:56:50.708,"telling me that I should, as the new preacher of this church, sacrifice myself."
00:56:50.791,00:56:53.541,so that y'all can have a share of the good meat tonight.
00:56:54.083,00:56:56.291,"And that's what I'm going to do, friends."
00:56:56.375,00:56:58.916,I'm going to eat these organs.
00:56:59.833,00:57:04.250,'Cause I model myself on the good Lord Jesus whenever he gives me the chance.
00:57:04.333,00:57:05.416,And today...
00:57:06.125,00:57:21.291,"he's blessed me with another opportunity Now, don't you worry about that pus-gutted blowhard."
00:57:21.375,00:57:23.875,I bet he ain't got two nickels to rub together.
00:57:23.958,00:57:26.708,I never been so embarrassed in all my life.
00:57:26.791,00:57:28.625,I could've crawled right under the table.
00:57:28.708,00:57:30.958,"-All right, I'm gonna go talk to him. -No, Arvin."
00:57:31.041,00:57:32.458,None of that.
00:57:32.541,00:57:34.708,He sure ain't the preacher I was hoping for.
00:57:35.625,00:57:39.250,"Grandma, that ain't no preacher. He's as bad as they got on the damn radio."
00:57:40.333,00:57:43.125,"Heck, I bet he just wanted them chicken livers all for his own self."
00:57:43.208,00:57:44.416,That's why he did that.
00:57:44.500,00:57:46.708,You see the way he was gobbling them down.
00:57:46.791,00:57:48.625,"You shouldn't talk like that, Arvin."
00:57:50.500,00:57:53.375,Preacher Teagardin wouldn't be here if the Lord hadn't sent him.
00:58:30.958,00:58:32.125,Are you not coming?
00:58:33.500,00:58:35.916,"No, I got some things to do before we go home."
00:58:37.958,00:58:40.291,Can't we go do them after I see Mama?
00:58:41.625,00:58:43.125,"No, you go on, I'll be back."
00:58:46.458,00:58:47.541,Go on.
00:58:59.375,00:59:03.458,"God has said in the next few years, we stand on the verge of paradise."
00:59:04.041,00:59:05.500,But there's something wrong.
00:59:05.833,00:59:10.916,"And I'm gonna tell you, we've got to have prayer power and spiritual power."
00:59:11.416,00:59:14.000,"In south Vietnam, soldiers fight with arms."
00:59:14.083,00:59:15.291,but now our spirit...
00:59:41.708,00:59:43.875,"Lenora Laferty, Preacher Teagardin."
00:59:44.541,00:59:45.791,"Girl, you been crying?"
00:59:46.291,00:59:47.291,It's nothing.
00:59:48.666,00:59:53.125,I just get down sometimes-- Uh...
00:59:55.166,00:59:59.833,"The kids at school, they like to tease, and I ain't gonna have family there come next year."
01:00:01.666,01:00:03.458,I was like you when I was your age.
01:00:05.541,01:00:06.666,Full of the Lord.
01:00:07.958,01:00:11.208,Some of them other kids just... came down hard on me.
01:00:12.458,01:00:13.833,What did you do about it?
01:00:16.541,01:00:17.375,Well...
01:00:18.541,01:00:19.791,it was a rough time.
01:00:20.833,01:00:22.041,They was just jealous.
01:00:23.666,01:00:24.541,Envy.
01:00:25.500,01:00:27.083,Brings out the worst in people.
01:00:28.625,01:00:30.250,Especially the young ones.
01:00:35.000,01:00:37.708,I don't know if you have anywhere you gotta be.
01:00:38.416,01:00:39.333,"But, uh..."
01:00:40.250,01:00:41.625,maybe we can take a drive.
01:00:42.791,01:00:46.250,There's a quiet place I found I like to go and pray on things.
01:01:05.333,01:01:08.250,Arvin had always been careful about picking his time.
01:01:11.500,01:01:16.291,He knew he'd stand a better chance if he didn't try to take on all the dirty bastards at once.
01:01:28.083,01:01:30.416,Nothing. It must not have got shut all the way.
01:01:31.541,01:01:33.416,"Let's get them bloomers off, come on."
01:01:33.500,01:01:35.250,You-- Close that door!
01:01:37.958,01:01:39.416,Goddamn better be worth it.
01:01:54.833,01:01:58.041,"Hey, Orville, will you start it up, man? I don't think it's the spark plugs."
01:02:02.208,01:02:03.291,Hey...
01:02:05.166,01:02:07.916,"No. Hey, Gene, you want another Twinkie?"
01:02:08.000,01:02:09.250,"I'm all right, thank you."
01:02:12.625,01:02:17.750,Wait-- Wait! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
01:02:46.083,01:02:47.500,You touch my sister again...
01:02:48.666,01:02:49.666,I'll kill you.
01:02:50.166,01:02:51.250,Do you understand me?
01:03:32.875,01:03:35.125,"Now, we can feel the Lord our here, can't we?"
01:03:40.916,01:03:43.125,It's kind of you to come all this way.
01:03:53.625,01:03:54.458,Lenora...
01:03:56.875,01:03:59.583,have you truly opened yourself to the Lord with...
01:04:00.541,01:04:02.416,Preacher Sykes or...
01:04:03.500,01:04:04.666,any other preacher?
01:04:08.041,01:04:08.875,Once...
01:04:10.500,01:04:12.708,Reverend Sykes wept with me.
01:04:15.125,01:04:16.416,That's not my meaning.
01:04:17.625,01:04:21.166,Have you shown yourself as the Lord made you?
01:04:25.708,01:04:27.541,You mean in my birthday suit? No.
01:04:28.916,01:04:30.416,-No? -No.
01:04:31.416,01:04:38.166,"To show yourself as the Lord made his first children, is to truly turn yourself to him..."
01:04:39.583,01:04:41.208,and his witnessing of it.
01:04:42.625,01:04:44.166,"Now, that's courage itself."
01:04:50.541,01:04:52.083,Meaning I take off my clothes?
01:04:55.541,01:04:57.125,Come on and pray with me.
01:04:59.666,01:05:03.958,"Lord, Lenora is showing herself to you."
01:05:04.041,01:05:07.500,"See her, Lord, as you made her."
01:05:07.583,01:05:09.833,She presents herself to you now.
01:05:10.333,01:05:12.083,Give her the strength.
01:05:52.583,01:05:56.666,We are together before the Lord.
01:05:58.875,01:05:59.916,Amen.
01:06:00.000,01:06:01.041,Amen.
01:06:21.250,01:06:22.708,Sorry I didn't come today.
01:06:23.583,01:06:24.583,It's okay.
01:06:25.416,01:06:27.916,I know there's other things you wanna be doing probably.
01:06:45.416,01:06:49.375,Lenora felt the same force that drew Helen to Roy Laferty.
01:06:50.250,01:06:54.875,The girl imagined that she could touch the love emanating from the preacher.
01:07:14.916,01:07:17.958,"Thirty-three to Athens, 50 to Clarksville..."
01:07:19.291,01:07:21.666,Seventy-nine North to Pittsburgh.
01:07:23.875,01:07:26.166,"Thirty-three, 50, 79."
01:07:27.708,01:07:30.083,"Thirty-three, 50, 79."
01:07:30.583,01:07:32.666,"Thirty-three, 50, 79."
01:07:33.250,01:07:34.416,"Fuck you, Carl!"
01:07:42.083,01:07:43.083,Shit.
01:07:44.958,01:07:45.875,Shit.
01:07:55.791,01:08:00.041,and the couple were getting ready for what would be their fourteenth road trip.
01:08:02.041,01:08:07.500,"Carl had decided long ago that young, good-looking hitchhikers were the best."
01:08:13.583,01:08:14.625,Couldn't sleep.
01:08:17.500,01:08:18.625,And you went outside for...
01:08:20.375,01:08:22.666,Thought I'd pack the limousine early.
01:08:27.791,01:08:30.625,"We don't pack early, Sandy, that's a rule."
01:08:34.375,01:08:35.833,-You fucking around? -No.
01:08:35.916,01:08:37.083,-Work? -No.
01:08:42.333,01:08:44.541,I gotta go into town for business tomorrow.
01:08:46.958,01:08:49.375,Think I wanna drive around in a car full of bags?
01:08:50.958,01:08:52.833,Buying a camera ain't business.
01:08:56.041,01:08:56.958,Hmm.
01:09:49.250,01:09:51.000,"I'm coming, God dammit!"
01:10:02.583,01:10:04.666,-You don't look too good. -I was asleep.
01:10:05.958,01:10:07.083,What do you want?
01:10:13.208,01:10:14.458,What are you looking for?
01:10:16.333,01:10:18.375,Stop tearing my damn kitchen apart.
01:10:18.458,01:10:19.625,You got any candy?
01:10:27.625,01:10:28.791,Going somewhere?
01:10:29.458,01:10:33.541,"Not that it's any of your business, big brother, but I'm going on a little vacation."
01:10:33.625,01:10:34.833,North Carolina.
01:10:41.166,01:10:42.458,"Why are you here, Lee?"
01:10:55.958,01:11:00.666,I've been getting a lot of calls from people about girls selling snatch out of Tecumseh.
01:11:01.958,01:11:04.166,They even mentioned your name a couple times.
01:11:04.250,01:11:05.166,That's horseshit.
01:11:10.250,01:11:12.333,"I got another election coming up, Sandy."
01:11:13.583,01:11:17.208,Ol' Matthew's out there doing anything he can to try to make me look bad.
01:11:19.375,01:11:22.000,Is Carl the one pimping you? That fat son of a bitch?
01:11:22.083,01:11:24.208,"No, he's working, making deliveries."
01:11:29.875,01:11:31.000,Deliveries?
01:11:32.458,01:11:33.583,For who?
01:11:33.666,01:11:34.875,Hell if I know.
01:11:35.583,01:11:38.375,But he's bringing home money that I don't gotta ask you for.
01:11:40.291,01:11:41.291,Is it Leroy?
01:11:44.291,01:11:45.833,"Get the fuck out of here, Lee."
01:11:53.958,01:11:57.375,"Just leave off the horn until after the election, you understand?"
01:11:59.208,01:12:01.458,Don't act like you do nothing wrong.
01:12:16.583,01:12:18.833,"I'm the law around here, little sister."
01:12:20.000,01:12:21.708,And that makes all the difference.
01:12:32.500,01:12:37.000,a 20-year-old carpenter out fishing early one morning in West Virginia.
01:12:37.083,01:12:39.250,"What the fuck are you doing, Sandy?"
01:13:00.083,01:13:03.916,Leroy's private space owns up half this dump.
01:13:04.000,01:13:05.916,I'm gonna inspect those whore rooms.
01:13:11.375,01:13:12.333,Let me by.
01:13:14.000,01:13:14.916,Lawman.
01:13:34.666,01:13:38.083,"as a newborn baby, you tell him who the whore is."
01:13:49.375,01:13:52.250,"once they start digging, they don't wanna stop."
01:13:53.833,01:14:03.333,"First, it would just be that the Sheriff had a whore for a sister, and after that, all the bribes and other shit that had piled up since he'd first pinned on a badge."
01:14:04.250,01:14:10.250,"And if he wasn't careful, eventually someone would find out about his own dealings with Leroy."
01:14:22.541,01:14:23.750,You got a new toy?
01:14:25.750,01:14:26.750,It's really rare.
01:14:27.333,01:14:28.625,It's got special bullets.
01:14:28.708,01:14:29.916,Untraceable.
01:14:41.125,01:14:42.958,That's gonna cost me my money.
01:14:44.250,01:14:47.083,Me losing money is gonna cost you your cut.
01:14:48.041,01:14:49.708,It didn't have anything to do with you.
01:14:50.916,01:14:51.875,It does now.
01:14:53.541,01:14:56.708,"Bobo, you ever go and beat the shit outta someone I made my money off?"
01:14:59.500,01:15:02.166,"Never crossed my mind, thinking about that."
01:15:05.791,01:15:11.208,Guy running against me is going door-to-door telling folk I look the other way when it comes to Sandy.
01:15:13.708,01:15:15.000,"Bobo, don't eat my scraps."
01:15:16.375,01:15:17.625,Give over the envelope.
01:15:34.708,01:15:35.958,There's debt you owe me.
01:15:37.375,01:15:39.500,What I'm gonna lose at the bar.
01:15:39.583,01:15:40.750,Horse shit.
01:15:40.833,01:15:42.416,You ain't losing nothing there.
01:15:44.583,01:15:51.750,And you know that 'cause you're a loaded diaper like everyone else who works for me or because all of Meade knows you're dirty?
01:16:01.166,01:16:03.416,That's your weekly earnings 'til we're square.
01:16:12.708,01:16:15.541,would kill him soon enough if he made any more trouble.
01:16:17.500,01:16:21.708,He had an election to think about and couldn't afford any liabilities.
01:16:52.083,01:16:55.875,"Gary. That was my dad's name, so at home, I'm Gary Matthew."
01:17:00.500,01:17:02.916,"Hell, Ol' Matthew, he's one of the Apostles."
01:17:03.416,01:17:06.041,"You probably knew your name came out of the Bible, didn't you?"
01:17:11.083,01:17:12.708,"But you've been baptized, right?"
01:17:14.875,01:17:16.041,We ain't heathens.
01:17:16.125,01:17:18.250,I just don't know much about the Bible is all.
01:17:18.750,01:17:19.625,Good.
01:17:21.666,01:17:24.375,Lord knows where a person who ain't saved might end up.
01:17:25.041,01:17:27.166,Hm... Right now it looks like Vietnam.
01:17:36.208,01:17:37.583,That's a good picture.
01:17:41.625,01:17:43.208,"You're a nice boy, Gary."
01:17:57.458,01:17:58.750,"What do you say we eat, huh?"
01:18:02.666,01:18:04.875,Bologna? You want cheese?
01:18:05.666,01:18:06.625,"Yes, please."
01:18:07.166,01:18:08.041,Okay.
01:18:15.250,01:18:16.416,"Here you go, hon."
01:18:30.083,01:18:31.208,"Oh, no, thank you."
01:18:31.291,01:18:32.500,You don't drink?
01:18:32.583,01:18:34.083,I don't hold it very well.
01:18:34.625,01:18:36.125,Usually gets me in trouble.
01:18:36.708,01:18:37.625,"Well, come on."
01:18:38.708,01:18:42.458,You mean to tell me you're not gonna have a drink with a pretty little thing like her?
01:18:52.041,01:18:53.541,Whoo! That'll wake you up.
01:19:05.791,01:19:06.833,I got an idea.
01:19:08.583,01:19:10.666,Seeing as we might not see one another again...
01:19:12.166,01:19:14.291,we oughta record this for posterity.
01:19:20.750,01:19:22.541,"-Sure, I'm game. -That's the spirit."
01:19:26.291,01:19:29.166,lie down on that blanket there on your side.
01:19:31.416,01:19:32.416,Like that.
01:19:33.416,01:19:37.750,"Now, take that bottle and hold it like you got it on you all the time."
01:20:18.833,01:20:22.000,-You're snoozing through Ferlin. -I don't like this gospel shit.
01:20:28.458,01:20:29.666,"You know, we did him a favor."
01:20:29.750,01:20:32.583,He was just gonna get shot up and killed in Vietnam anyways.
01:20:36.208,01:20:37.291,God dammit.
01:20:37.958,01:20:40.875,-He wasn't nothing but another model. -I told you I don't like this anymore.
01:20:40.958,01:20:43.250,Ain't it fair if I hate the way some of 'em cry?
01:20:43.333,01:20:46.875,"Not that you'd appreciate it, but tears make for a good photograph."
01:20:49.500,01:20:53.250,"was that to his way of thinking, this was the one true religion."
01:20:54.416,01:20:59.750,Only in the presence of death could he feel the presence of something like God.
01:21:14.666,01:21:16.291,How about we check into a motel?
01:21:17.041,01:21:20.125,"Get a couple of steaks, and relax for a day or two."
01:21:20.208,01:21:21.291,How does that sound?
01:21:27.000,01:21:29.750,"But he ain't a coward, he went and got himself killed."
01:21:30.583,01:21:32.541,Buried by the Mechums River in West Virginia.
01:21:32.625,01:21:34.333,Chopped up pretty bad in a suitcase.
01:21:35.416,01:21:37.166,"No, I won't speak to nobody else."
01:21:49.375,01:21:58.166,in my reading about sin where someone got so sick...
01:21:59.666,01:22:08.541,over some sin they felt they had committed that was so terrible that they...
01:22:10.125,01:22:13.125,started imagining things.
01:22:15.333,01:22:17.541,"Back, I read a story about..."
01:22:18.708,01:22:19.750,people.
01:22:20.333,01:22:21.333,Poor people.
01:22:22.791,01:22:25.833,Barely able to write...
01:22:27.250,01:22:28.375,thinking they're...
01:22:29.166,01:22:31.958,the president or...
01:22:32.833,01:22:38.041,or a Hollywood celebrity like Ava Gardner.
01:22:42.083,01:22:52.166,I-- I don't understand what you're talking about.
01:22:54.500,01:22:56.333,"The thing is, that's the part of it."
01:22:57.250,01:22:58.458,The book says...
01:22:59.708,01:23:02.958,"it's not, not understanding."
01:23:04.166,01:23:05.583,"See, think about it."
01:23:06.708,01:23:07.791,How...
01:23:09.083,01:23:11.750,could I be the daddy...
01:23:12.666,01:23:15.666,when all we done is spend time with the Lord?
01:23:28.708,01:23:30.000,You win this time?
01:23:32.375,01:23:33.916,"No, not really."
01:23:37.708,01:23:40.000,Saw Fred Dinwoodie over there.
01:23:40.083,01:23:42.458,He said his boy is just about healed up.
01:23:44.333,01:23:46.916,I still think you could have held back a little bit.
01:23:48.458,01:23:50.541,"Well, he ain't bothered Lenora since."
01:23:51.916,01:23:53.750,Him or his candy-ass buddies.
01:23:54.416,01:23:57.416,I gotta go check in on her. She ain't been feeling too good.
01:23:58.166,01:24:00.833,You keep an eye on her for me while we're at church.
01:24:09.333,01:24:10.791,He didn't mind much.
01:24:11.291,01:24:16.166,His mind would always drift back to Willard and the prayer log and his poor dog Jack.
01:24:17.625,01:24:22.625,"Besides, he'd gotten a job working on the road crew and was busy making some money."
01:24:35.250,01:24:36.833,I'm so ashamed.
01:24:39.500,01:24:41.541,You ain't got nothing to be ashamed of.
01:24:41.625,01:24:44.625,I'm sure the Lord will forgive you for missing one Sunday.
01:24:45.791,01:24:48.625,Ol' Jesus probably had his fair share of bad mornings.
01:25:08.333,01:25:10.500,go see your mama's grave when you're better?
01:25:13.291,01:25:14.375,Sound all right?
01:25:18.750,01:25:25.458,is filled with good men and women suffering delusions.
01:25:27.083,01:25:28.666,Eve in the garden.
01:25:29.916,01:25:30.916,Noah...
01:25:31.500,01:25:33.208,"naked, drunk."
01:25:33.875,01:25:35.958,Bringing shame upon his family.
01:25:37.416,01:25:40.041,The idol the Jews bowed before in the desert.
01:25:43.458,01:25:49.500,And even the Lord Jesus himself was presented with delusions in the desert that only through his faith...
01:25:50.125,01:25:51.500,and his strength...
01:25:57.000,01:26:01.041,The Lord's delusion in the desert was a game...
01:26:02.708,01:26:05.458,of the so-called Devil.
01:26:08.166,01:26:10.458,And what the Lord experienced...
01:26:11.541,01:26:15.041,was a delusion that would've kept him from saving us!
01:26:15.541,01:26:17.875,But he did not fall for it!
01:26:20.333,01:26:24.541,It is our delusions that lead us to sin.
01:26:27.083,01:26:30.958,Striking a mother or a wife for something that you thought they said.
01:26:32.750,01:26:35.833,"Neglecting work or Sunday service, for that matter."
01:26:38.375,01:26:39.583,Some girl...
01:26:40.250,01:26:43.583,gets a feeling for a fella and lets him have her holy gift.
01:26:47.875,01:26:49.750,Delusions!
01:26:51.041,01:26:58.500,Blaspheming the Lord in your mind and in your heart for some wrong done to you by another person.
01:27:02.583,01:27:03.958,You're saying you don't...
01:27:05.000,01:27:07.833,remember all the things we did in your car?
01:27:11.500,01:27:13.166,I'm saying you must be crazy.
01:27:13.250,01:27:16.750,Coming in the Lord's house and talking all this trash.
01:27:19.458,01:27:21.458,"Look, my advice to you, girl..."
01:27:23.458,01:27:25.208,is you figure some way to get rid of it.
01:27:26.666,01:27:28.041,'Cause otherwise...
01:27:29.041,01:27:39.833,"it's gonna be you, a whore mother, and her little bastard child running around, living in that poor old woman's house who raised you."
01:27:41.625,01:27:44.125,"If nothing else, think of her."
01:27:44.791,01:27:47.041,She'll die from the shame of it all.
01:27:59.625,01:28:00.708,Come on.
01:28:17.333,01:28:18.208,Come on.
01:28:37.916,01:28:42.791,Grandma wouldn't be ashamed and she and her baby would be okay.
01:29:00.708,01:29:02.583,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
01:29:02.708,01:29:05.000,No! No! No!
01:29:07.000,01:29:08.166,Grandma!
01:29:08.333,01:29:10.208,"No, no, no!"
01:29:13.250,01:29:14.458,Grandma!
01:29:26.541,01:29:29.875,"and that in the end, she was all right with her maker."
01:29:30.333,01:29:31.416,"Oh, Lord."
01:29:33.958,01:29:36.458,There's just some things we can't understand.
01:29:40.291,01:29:42.333,But you take her into your arms.
01:29:50.083,01:29:51.375,"Uh, ain't somebody..."
01:29:52.875,01:29:54.250,saying prayers or...
01:30:35.833,01:30:36.833,See ya tomorrow.
01:30:45.000,01:30:46.208,It's about Lenora.
01:30:50.791,01:30:51.791,What about her?
01:30:54.625,01:30:57.250,I came by here instead of home so nothing's...
01:30:57.958,01:30:59.250,put on your grandmother.
01:31:00.958,01:31:02.333,Put on? What do you mean?
01:31:03.875,01:31:04.791,Well...
01:31:07.416,01:31:09.333,"ol' Dudley, in the Coroner's..."
01:31:10.333,01:31:12.000,I ain't never heard of no Dudley.
01:31:13.000,01:31:15.541,"Well, he's a drunk... but he ain't no liar."
01:31:17.750,01:31:20.291,Did you know Lenora was carrying a baby?
01:31:26.458,01:31:27.625,That's bullshit.
01:31:28.541,01:31:30.125,That son of a bitch is lying.
01:31:31.708,01:31:32.708,I tell ya...
01:31:33.875,01:31:35.166,Dudley ain't a liar.
01:31:36.458,01:31:39.708,He came to me privately so as your family knew.
01:31:40.541,01:31:41.791,I felt he was right.
01:31:47.458,01:31:50.541,"Now, I might've put my foot in something. It..."
01:31:51.166,01:31:52.625,wasn't my intentions.
01:31:55.666,01:31:58.250,You know that preacher ain't said no words for her.
01:32:00.541,01:32:02.458,Not for people that kill themselves.
01:34:16.000,01:34:20.833,but they would be better off not knowing anything if the law came looking for him.
01:34:20.916,01:34:22.708,You have to be good to Grandma.
01:34:26.625,01:34:29.750,You know that she ain't hardly been out of her bed since the funeral?
01:34:30.666,01:34:31.583,Yeah.
01:34:32.833,01:34:34.041,Grandma needs you.
01:34:36.000,01:34:36.958,All right?
01:35:37.166,01:35:40.625,I'm writing to you because I cannot say goodbye to your face.
01:35:41.333,01:35:45.375,I love you and I will always remember the things that you have done for me.
01:35:46.500,01:35:51.291,"What I'm about to do, I do because I have to, not because I want to."
01:35:51.958,01:35:53.833,Please do not try and find me.
01:35:53.916,01:35:56.375,"Love, your grandson, Arvin."
01:36:24.125,01:36:25.125,Excuse me.
01:36:25.208,01:36:26.250,Preacher?
01:36:30.250,01:36:31.750,Got time for a sinner?
01:36:35.250,01:36:38.125,I've been doing wrong and I wanna get right by the Lord.
01:36:42.541,01:36:44.208,"Well, that's what I'm here for."
01:36:48.208,01:36:49.125,I've done...
01:36:51.250,01:36:52.708,lustful acts.
01:36:55.875,01:36:56.833,Yeah.
01:36:58.041,01:37:00.000,That could be a big problem.
01:37:00.666,01:37:02.125,Especially for the young people.
01:37:03.791,01:37:05.208,"Go on, tell me about it."
01:37:07.041,01:37:09.041,I got me a pretty wife at home.
01:37:10.375,01:37:12.791,One that'll do pretty much anything I ask.
01:37:14.625,01:37:16.083,But I treat her real bad.
01:37:17.833,01:37:21.208,"Well, when you say anything, what do you mean?"
01:37:23.583,01:37:24.791,Just what I said.
01:37:26.791,01:37:30.208,Sometimes she'll be going down on me with...
01:37:32.875,01:37:34.375,"well, you know, her mouth."
01:37:36.250,01:37:38.833,"Heck, I get so excited I start forcing it."
01:37:43.208,01:37:44.666,She ever puke on you?
01:37:46.541,01:37:49.333,"They got a little trigger, back there in their throat."
01:37:51.125,01:37:52.833,"Yeah, well, that ain't my problem."
01:37:54.000,01:37:55.833,"Well, what's the problem then, son?"
01:38:00.541,01:38:03.250,This guy I work with has got himself a daughter.
01:38:04.791,01:38:07.791,"Real young thing, just started high school."
01:38:11.208,01:38:15.625,One day I got this girl in my truck and I drove her out into the sticks and I...
01:38:17.416,01:38:18.750,had my way with her.
01:38:22.708,01:38:24.250,Did she put up a fight?
01:38:26.541,01:38:27.541,No.
01:38:30.791,01:38:32.541,"But, you see, the problem is, is..."
01:38:34.625,01:38:37.416,"once I'd had a taste, I just couldn't get enough."
01:38:38.750,01:38:41.208,I kept taking that girl there any chance I got.
01:38:43.458,01:38:44.708,So I'd strip her clothes off.
01:38:48.625,01:38:50.833,But I'd make her pray before we got started.
01:38:58.583,01:39:00.833,"Why don't you take that hat off, boy."
01:39:02.416,01:39:03.500,Sometimes I'd even...
01:39:04.000,01:39:05.333,keep her panties.
01:39:07.791,01:39:08.916,"Now, I'd just..."
01:39:10.583,01:39:12.875,sniff 'em as she rode off on her bike.
01:39:15.125,01:39:20.125,And then I'd go home to that whore of a wife of mine and make her bake me a cake like I was celebrating.
01:39:21.958,01:39:23.750,"You've been spying on me, boy?"
01:39:28.625,01:39:31.458,I've been watching your every move for the last couple weeks.
01:39:34.083,01:39:36.375,"You can't get enough of that Reaster girl, can you?"
01:39:43.666,01:39:44.625,So...
01:39:45.708,01:39:46.791,Mrs. Russell's boy?
01:39:50.041,01:39:51.041,All right.
01:39:54.958,01:39:57.041,"Don't do anything you'll regret, son."
01:39:57.708,01:40:00.208,Why don't you put the gun down and...
01:40:01.125,01:40:02.708,we can talk all about it.
01:40:03.333,01:40:04.541,Go ahead and talk.
01:40:10.416,01:40:11.833,It wasn't my fault.
01:40:14.750,01:40:16.458,And Lenora...
01:40:18.250,01:40:19.500,was just like this...
01:40:20.833,01:40:22.000,this Reaster girl.
01:40:23.458,01:40:24.791,She wouldn't let me be.
01:40:26.750,01:40:35.083,But I want you to know that I-- I pray for that girl's soul every night.
01:40:35.833,01:40:37.833,Do you pray for her baby's soul too?
01:40:38.458,01:40:40.541,"Look, I didn't have..."
01:40:40.625,01:40:42.125,nothing to do with that.
01:40:43.500,01:40:44.791,She came to me...
01:40:45.291,01:40:48.875,-saying she got that way from a boy-- -Don't fuckin' lie to me!
01:40:52.333,01:40:55.541,The lies-- The lies are hers.
01:40:57.458,01:41:01.041,She got it in her head that I was the father.
01:41:01.541,01:41:03.708,That I was gonna take care of everything.
01:41:03.791,01:41:05.416,"God dammit, boy!"
01:41:05.916,01:41:06.958,Listen to me!
01:41:08.666,01:41:12.458,I ain't gonna take the blame for no bastard child!
01:41:12.541,01:41:14.000,"It would ruin me, man."
01:41:14.791,01:41:16.583,"You can understand that, can't you?"
01:41:17.125,01:41:18.083,Hell!
01:41:19.916,01:41:21.041,"Listen to me, boy."
01:41:23.541,01:41:25.541,She was...
01:41:26.583,01:41:27.583,delusional.
01:41:29.791,01:41:30.916,She was crazy.
01:41:34.708,01:41:35.666,You see?
01:41:37.333,01:41:38.875,"No, she was just lonely."
01:41:40.666,01:41:41.625,"No, man."
01:41:49.583,01:41:50.833,"Please, God!"
01:41:51.708,01:41:52.708,"Please, God!"
01:42:09.625,01:42:10.875,Shit.
01:42:16.250,01:42:17.250,Shit.
01:42:50.958,01:42:52.875,or any he ever called home.
01:42:53.833,01:42:58.875,"But in this moment, he felt a sudden force pulling in back towards Knockemstiff."
01:43:00.500,01:43:07.375,"No matter what else happened, he had to try to set right those things about his father that still ate at his heart."
01:43:44.916,01:43:47.166,Come on.
01:43:49.166,01:43:50.000,Fuck.
01:44:16.125,01:44:17.708,Sorry to come by so early.
01:44:18.916,01:44:21.500,I was on my way to work and...
01:44:22.333,01:44:23.958,I thought I might chew your ear.
01:44:25.000,01:44:27.166,Still thinking about that gun you showed me.
01:44:28.375,01:44:31.583,Uh... I'm gonna scramble some eggs. You want some?
01:44:32.083,01:44:32.916,Yeah.
01:44:37.833,01:44:39.541,I'll take coffee if you got any.
01:44:44.125,01:44:45.250,Leroy here?
01:44:45.791,01:44:46.833,He's upstairs.
01:44:49.208,01:44:50.875,Pistol's in the dining room.
01:44:52.750,01:44:53.750,Pretty nifty.
01:45:07.791,01:45:09.083,It's a fine piece.
01:45:14.458,01:45:16.708,Wonder if you'd consider selling me it.
01:45:19.750,01:45:22.708,"But everything's got a price, I guess."
01:45:28.500,01:45:31.041,"You know, one thing I never can get is the..."
01:45:31.833,01:45:32.916,scoops and water.
01:45:33.458,01:45:38.875,Is it more water to scoops or more scoops to water?
01:45:48.208,01:45:50.791,Jackie first toured with The Beatles...
01:45:52.791,01:45:54.041,"He goes there, does it."
01:45:57.583,01:45:58.500,You too.
01:46:12.750,01:46:13.791,Huh.
01:46:28.083,01:46:29.083,I see him.
01:46:31.416,01:46:32.291,Carl?
01:46:35.083,01:46:37.708,-We don't even know where he's going. -Carl?
01:46:37.791,01:46:39.750,"-Just-- -God dammit, Carl."
01:46:39.833,01:46:41.291,He's going to Ohio.
01:46:41.375,01:46:43.375,No one from home. That's your rule.
01:46:47.083,01:46:49.208,"Let's just see where he's going, Sandy."
01:46:53.333,01:46:54.208,Morning.
01:46:54.958,01:46:55.916,Where you headed?
01:46:56.416,01:46:58.041,"Meade, Ohio. You heard of it?"
01:47:00.666,01:47:02.125,"The paper-mill town, right?"
01:47:02.208,01:47:03.333,"Yeah, that's right."
01:47:06.958,01:47:08.791,We're passing right through it.
01:47:18.125,01:47:20.791,"No, I used to live there a long time ago."
01:47:33.708,01:47:35.708,"We're headed up to Chicago, Illinois."
01:47:37.375,01:47:40.000,"We like picking up strangers along the way, don't we?"
01:47:40.083,01:47:41.416,"Meet new people, don't we, hon?"
01:47:43.125,01:47:44.166,Sure do.
01:47:47.416,01:47:49.708,My old billy don't work like it used to.
01:47:52.666,01:47:54.875,pull over and take a leak somewhere here.
01:47:57.833,01:47:58.666,Sure.
01:47:58.750,01:48:01.416,There should be a road somewhere up here on the right.
01:48:06.000,01:48:08.625,Little further. Slow down. Turn in right here.
01:48:08.708,01:48:09.666,This is good.
01:48:38.500,01:48:39.625,"Yeah, this'll work."
01:48:45.958,01:48:47.083,I won't be long.
01:49:12.208,01:49:13.333,"Oh, shoot."
01:49:29.125,01:49:32.500,You have to be patient with me while I get a few shots off.
01:49:33.833,01:49:34.916,"Hon, give me the key."
01:49:36.000,01:49:38.583,Don't you worry none. We've got some hooch in the back and...
01:49:39.875,01:49:41.875,"Well, Sandy's good company."
01:49:52.708,01:49:56.291,and taking off with the boy in the backseat suddenly crossed Sandy's mind.
01:50:03.083,01:50:06.791,"He was young, but that didn't mean she couldn't make it work."
01:50:17.875,01:50:31.791,"Tell you what, son. Why don't you ste-- I don't wanna shoot you! Put the gun down!"
01:50:32.458,01:50:33.916,-I don't want to shoot. -I'm so sorry!
01:50:45.708,01:50:46.625,Heels.
01:50:53.125,01:50:57.166,Carl brought the additional quality of being maniacally paranoid.
01:50:59.166,01:51:07.166,"Sandy's behavior before they left home made him uneasy, and Carl thought it'd be better if he was the only one with a loaded weapon."
01:51:10.166,01:51:12.291,Poor Sandy never stood a chance.
01:51:16.583,01:51:18.458,Her gun was loaded with blanks.
01:51:43.458,01:51:45.208,"New Burlington, Indiana."
01:51:46.333,01:51:49.416,Carl never photographed a more symmetrical face.
01:51:49.958,01:51:52.375,This photo really meant something to him.
01:51:52.708,01:51:54.083,Jim had been their first.
01:52:43.708,01:52:44.666,"Sheriff, you there?"
01:52:44.750,01:52:48.250,A farmer called in a double homicide off the 506. I need you here.
01:52:59.125,01:53:00.833,"I'm sorry, Lee. This is fucked up."
01:53:01.333,01:53:02.291,What do you mean?
01:53:02.875,01:53:04.291,It's your sister and her husband.
01:53:12.791,01:53:13.875,Sandy once.
01:53:17.500,01:53:19.333,It looks like it was a nine millimeter.
01:53:19.416,01:53:21.083,Sandy got one shot off but...
01:53:22.125,01:53:23.708,her gun was loaded with blanks.
01:53:37.958,01:53:40.166,Give me a couple minutes here alone with her.
01:53:48.041,01:53:51.416,but Lee blamed Carl for the way she'd gone downhill.
01:53:52.125,01:53:55.958,"Regardless of all that, she was still his baby sister."
01:54:01.708,01:54:05.208,But the sheriff couldn't help but think of his own situation for a moment.
01:54:06.041,01:54:12.125,He thought about that photo he found of her and worried about what else people might find if he didn't get to it first.
01:55:48.125,01:55:51.791,"Reverend Roy Laferty, Durham, North Carolina."
01:55:52.500,01:56:02.208,"Though the poor fucker had been completely worthless as a model, Carl was insistent on keeping a record of both his successes and his failures."
01:56:44.541,01:56:46.000,You look like you've been traveling.
01:56:49.333,01:56:50.916,-Yeah. -Where you headed?
01:56:53.750,01:56:56.750,There used to be a house and a barn up on the hill over there.
01:56:56.833,01:56:58.791,Some lawyer owned it. You know it?
01:56:58.875,01:56:59.875,Sure I do.
01:57:00.666,01:57:02.083,Up in the Mitchell Flats.
01:57:03.708,01:57:04.666,Still there?
01:57:07.000,01:57:08.291,"Well, I'll be damned."
01:57:09.458,01:57:11.041,"You're that Russell boy, ain't you?"
01:57:14.583,01:57:18.250,"I just thought, seeing as I was this way, I'd stop by and see the old place again."
01:57:25.333,01:57:27.000,They think some kids did it.
01:57:27.500,01:57:30.416,Wasn't nobody ever living there since you and your folks.
01:57:30.958,01:57:34.000,"Well, heck, I come all this way, I may as well walk up there anyways."
01:57:34.083,01:57:37.833,"Sure, just cut across Clarence's pasture."
01:57:37.916,01:57:39.166,He won't say nothing.
01:57:47.916,01:57:50.541,I never did thank you for the night my dad died.
01:57:52.333,01:57:56.333,"You were awful kind of me, and I just want you to know that I ain't never forgot it."
01:57:57.166,01:58:00.250,You had that pie smeared all across your face.
01:58:00.791,01:58:04.208,Damn Bodecker thought it was blood. Remember that?
01:58:04.875,01:58:07.083,"Yeah, I remember everything about that night."
01:58:08.666,01:58:10.500,He ain't the lawman that I expected.
01:58:11.333,01:58:12.833,Shame about his sister though.
01:58:13.500,01:58:14.791,Why? What happened?
01:58:14.875,01:58:17.291,"Well, his sister and her husband were found dead."
01:58:17.833,01:58:19.458,Not far from Meade.
01:58:24.416,01:58:25.375,You come back to see me.
01:58:26.666,01:58:28.125,We'll sit out and drink some beer.
01:58:29.041,01:58:30.125,I'll do that.
01:58:32.541,01:58:36.166,"Got a call from Sheriff Thompson in Lewisburg, West Virginia."
01:58:36.250,01:58:38.041,Wants you to call him back as soon as possible.
01:58:41.083,01:58:42.583,He was a preacher.
01:58:42.666,01:58:45.708,And we're suspecting it's a boy that used to live up around your parts.
01:58:45.791,01:58:46.833,That right?
01:58:47.333,01:58:48.583,How'd he kill the man?
01:58:48.666,01:58:50.416,A couple shots.
01:58:50.500,01:58:53.916,Pistol. Probably a Luger that the boy's known to have.
01:58:55.291,01:58:57.625,"-That's a nine millimeter, ain't it? -That's right."
01:58:59.750,01:59:01.333,What'd you say the boy's name was?
01:59:01.416,01:59:04.000,"I didn't say, but it's Arvin Russell."
01:59:04.083,01:59:07.000,"Both of his parents died up around there, as I understand it."
01:59:07.083,01:59:11.625,"Father was a suicide, and he's been living down here with the grandmother and the uncle."
01:59:12.125,01:59:14.666,"Listen, I don't think the boy's dangerous."
01:59:15.541,01:59:19.000,"From what I'm hearing, this preacher might've deserved killing."
01:59:19.083,01:59:19.916,Is this boy driving?
01:59:20.916,01:59:21.791,Could be.
01:59:21.875,01:59:25.500,"He owns an ol' busted up Chevy 3100, '54."
01:59:25.583,01:59:28.000,I don't know that it'd make it all the way up there.
01:59:28.083,01:59:30.291,"At this point, he might be hitchhiking."
01:59:30.375,01:59:33.000,"Dark hair, not bad looking. Quiet."
01:59:38.708,01:59:40.250,Who's gonna bury Jack?
01:59:45.916,01:59:46.750,I don't know.
01:59:48.416,01:59:50.791,I don't know who's gonna wanna touch that thing.
02:00:00.083,02:00:05.958,"my daddy didn't do anything like what your daddy did up there, but he did up and leave me, my mama, and my sister."
02:00:07.958,02:00:11.375,He just went off to the shoe factory one morning and never came back.
02:00:12.166,02:00:14.916,And there was nothing to do but forget his sorry ass.
02:00:18.125,02:00:21.041,Some people were born just so they could be buried.
02:02:22.291,02:02:25.083,how Willard wanted so much for her to live.
02:02:25.750,02:02:28.000,His father would have done anything to save her.
02:02:28.625,02:02:32.291,"Fuck the blood and stink, the heat and the insects."
02:02:32.833,02:02:33.791,Anything.
02:02:34.291,02:02:36.250,Arvin said to himself.
02:02:38.083,02:02:48.791,"And suddenly he realized, standing in his father's church, that he'd had no other choice, that Willard had needed to go wherever Charlotte went."
02:03:28.833,02:03:30.291,Arvin Russell!
02:03:32.125,02:03:33.666,I know you're down there somewhere!
02:03:35.208,02:03:37.125,"It's Sheriff Bodecker, son!"
02:03:38.875,02:03:40.416,Got some questions to ask you!
02:03:50.875,02:03:52.166,Sorry about that!
02:03:54.416,02:03:56.208,Goddamn bird scared me.
02:04:00.625,02:04:02.083,I ain't here to hurt you!
02:04:05.458,02:04:08.000,And I know that you don't wanna hurt me!
02:04:10.000,02:04:12.166,Come on out so we can have us a talk!
02:04:39.875,02:04:42.000,Remember that night you brought me up here?
02:04:43.416,02:04:45.500,That was an awful thing your daddy did.
02:04:50.083,02:04:53.458,"God dammit, boy, don't-- don't fuck with me!"
02:05:03.708,02:05:06.375,"Put the gun down, Sheriff! I got one pointed right at you!"
02:05:11.958,02:05:13.083,"Can't do that, son!"
02:05:14.708,02:05:17.250,Just set it on the ground and step away!
02:05:20.458,02:05:21.416,What?
02:05:21.500,02:05:23.791,Just set it on the ground and step away!
02:05:25.500,02:05:29.625,So you can kill me like you did my sister and that preacher down in West Virginia?!
02:05:33.125,02:05:35.208,"I'm not a bad person, Sheriff."
02:05:36.208,02:05:38.041,That preacher weren't no good!
02:05:39.541,02:05:42.958,"He hurt my sister so bad she killed herself, Sheriff!"
02:05:43.041,02:05:44.083,I had no choice!
02:05:54.541,02:05:57.708,"I hate to be the one to tell you this, Sheriff, but your sister..."
02:05:58.291,02:06:00.291,"and her husband, they weren't no good neither!"
02:06:00.375,02:06:03.833,I got a snapshot in my pocket here of her hugging on some dead guy.
02:06:03.916,02:06:05.791,You let loose that gun and I'll show it to you!
02:06:55.083,02:06:56.583,I had no choice.
02:06:59.666,02:07:01.708,"They were gonna kill me, I swear."
02:07:04.833,02:07:06.708,I begged her to put the gun down.
02:07:15.375,02:07:16.416,I'm sorry.
02:07:21.375,02:07:27.916,"while he listened to the Sheriff fight to stay alive, it actually took the man only a few minutes to die."
02:08:45.041,02:08:46.250,"Thank you, mister."
02:08:47.125,02:08:49.000,I didn't think anybody was gonna pick me up.
02:08:49.875,02:08:51.083,Looks like you had a rough day.
02:08:53.625,02:08:55.333,"Uh, where you headed?"
02:08:59.041,02:09:00.875,-All right. -That okay for you?
02:09:03.666,02:09:05.791,"Yeah, I've been meaning to get up that way."
02:09:08.833,02:09:13.500,to significantly increase the number of US troops deployed to south Vietnam.
02:09:13.583,02:09:17.083,He explained the reason for his actions in these historic words.
02:09:21.125,02:09:28.458,that we cannot be defeated by force of arms or by superior power.
02:09:29.916,02:09:31.791,They're not easily convinced.
02:09:37.208,02:09:41.791,"and as he fought hard to stay awake, his mind began taking him places."
02:09:44.958,02:09:48.416,He started to think maybe the law would recognize he had done good.
02:09:51.375,02:09:53.000,Maybe he'd be forgiven.
02:09:53.708,02:09:57.375,Maybe he'd even be able to see Grandma and Uncle Earskell again.
02:09:58.750,02:10:00.625,Or maybe that was too risky.
02:10:03.458,02:10:04.291,What happened?
02:10:08.458,02:10:12.083,"maybe he'd meet a girl, start a family like his daddy did."
02:10:17.750,02:10:22.625,"As the thoughts came, he wasn't sure if he was going backwards or forwards."
02:10:23.791,02:10:28.291,"He knew wherever this was, it felt nicer than Knockemstiff."
02:10:28.958,02:10:31.541,No fighting or screaming or pain.
02:10:33.166,02:10:36.125,Then the thought of enlisting got into his brain.
02:10:37.416,02:10:41.041,And he wasn't sure if he was thinking about himself or Willard anymore.
02:10:43.750,02:10:46.666,He didn't want to end up in a war like his father.
02:10:47.208,02:10:49.750,But he was good at fighting.
02:10:50.041,02:10:51.875,Maybe that's where he belonged.
02:10:53.750,02:10:57.375,"Grandma would tell him to pray on it, and he'd laugh at her."
02:10:57.916,02:11:00.291,But maybe she knew something he didn't.
02:11:01.333,02:11:07.875,"Right now, he needed sleep and just felt lucky someone was giving him a ride."
