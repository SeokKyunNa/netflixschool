00:03:45.417,00:03:47.041,We're tired and we can't see the end.
00:03:48.375,00:03:53.291,We can't even console ourselves that our enemy is just as tired as we are.
00:03:53.333,00:03:55.000,Because they're not.
00:03:57.917,00:04:03.542,It is a fallacy that prolonged war will weaken an occupied enemy.

00:04:04.792,00:04:08.291,It most likely will make your enemy stronger.
00:04:08.333,00:04:12.500,They get used to the deprivation and they adapt and respond accordingly.

00:04:58.375,00:05:09.041,What we're dealing with here is potentially a global conflagration that requires constant diligence in order to suppress.
00:05:09.667,00:05:19.875,"Now, you see, because our enemy has realized that they are fighting guys from the future."
00:05:21.375,00:05:25.792,"Now, ahem, it is brilliant as it is infuriating."
00:05:25.834,00:05:34.166,"If you live like it's the past and you behave like it's the past, then guys from the future find it very hard to see you."

00:05:54.625,00:06:02.125,"In a situation like this, your friends dress just like your enemies and your enemies dress like your friends."
00:06:02.166,00:06:07.333,"What I need you to fully understand is that these people, they do not wanna negotiate."
00:06:07.375,00:06:09.583,Not at all.
00:06:09.625,00:06:18.750,"They want the universal caliphate established across the face of the Earth, and they want every infidel converted or dead."
00:06:22.000,00:06:33.333,"So, what's changed is that our allegedly unsophisticated enemy has cottoned on to the factually unsophisticated truth, we're an easy target."
00:06:33.375,00:06:43.083,We are an easy target and our world as we know it is a lot simpler to put to an end than you might think.

00:07:26.417,00:07:28.500,Nobody gets traded.

00:07:48.834,00:07:52.875,"So he gets all fucked in his head after the invasion, you know?"
00:07:52.917,00:07:55.709,"He starts working with the Baathists, then the jihadists."
00:07:55.750,00:07:58.500,"But he is scared shitless now, man."
00:07:58.542,00:08:03.500,"He's supposed to do a martyrdom operation, but he doesn't wanna fucking die."

00:09:37.625,00:09:40.000,Fuck that shit. I will shoot you right now. Just go.
00:09:40.041,00:09:42.458,I'm not kidding.
00:09:46.166,00:09:47.375,Nizar!
00:09:50.125,00:09:51.834,Woman: Zooming in.
00:09:51.875,00:09:54.125,Visual confirmed.
00:09:54.166,00:09:56.166,Long wave 10.7.
00:10:05.542,00:10:06.709,Shit.
00:10:06.750,00:10:08.291,"I can't talk right now, Larry."
00:10:08.333,00:10:10.166,She wants the house.
00:10:10.208,00:10:12.583,FERRIS: Give her damn the house.
00:10:12.625,00:10:14.875,"We're getting this, sir."
00:10:14.917,00:10:18.250,"She can ask for whatever she wants, but I'm not listening."
00:10:18.291,00:10:20.750,FERRIS: What are you calling for?
00:10:20.792,00:10:22.417,Hang up the phone.
00:10:24.333,00:10:25.709,FERRIS: Are you on the line?
00:10:25.750,00:10:27.583,"Listen, I can see you now, all right?"
00:10:27.625,00:10:28.875,You are attracting attention.
00:10:28.917,00:10:30.458,Get the fuck out of here right now.
00:10:30.500,00:10:31.667,I will handle this on my own.
00:10:31.709,00:10:33.709,Roger that. Off target.
00:10:33.750,00:10:36.000,"WOMAN: Copy. Off target, 3-10."
00:10:40.917,00:10:43.208,Do you speak English?
00:10:43.250,00:10:44.500,Yes.
00:10:44.542,00:10:45.875,"Good, good, good."
00:10:48.834,00:10:52.542,FERRIS: You want an orange? You hungry?
00:10:52.583,00:10:53.792,No.
00:10:57.250,00:11:01.709,"So, Nizar, why'd you come to me, huh?"
00:11:01.750,00:11:03.959,I know too many things.
00:11:05.458,00:11:09.291,They prepared me to go outside Iraq.
00:11:09.333,00:11:12.125,What do you mean by outside Iraq?
00:11:12.166,00:11:17.959,"They said they need me to become shahid, for martyrdom."
00:11:18.000,00:11:21.583,"When a man knows too much, they say martyrdom."
00:11:21.625,00:11:25.875,"Who do you mean by they, Nizar? Hmm?"
00:11:31.250,00:11:33.166,I don't want to die.
00:11:36.208,00:11:38.083,I want to go to America.
00:11:38.125,00:11:41.083,"I have a Ph.D., you know?"
00:11:41.125,00:11:44.083,And they want me-- They want me to blow myself up.
00:11:44.125,00:11:46.041,"Ph.D. in what, chemistry?"
00:11:46.083,00:11:47.667,No.
00:11:47.709,00:11:49.625,What do you know about radiological materials?
00:11:49.667,00:11:52.625,"Linguistic. I speak five languages. Five, you know?"
00:11:52.667,00:11:55.250,Nobody should say martyr to me. Nobody.
00:11:55.291,00:11:57.250,You are a rare and a delicate flower.
00:11:57.291,00:11:58.083,"Yes, I am."
00:11:58.125,00:11:59.750,Yes.
00:11:59.792,00:12:03.166,"So you don't wanna kill the Jews and the Crusaders, huh?"
00:12:03.208,00:12:05.834,What do you know about our pain?
00:12:05.875,00:12:08.291,"Cut the bullshit, all right?"
00:12:08.333,00:12:10.625,Give me some information.
00:12:16.125,00:12:19.208,"You know, I know enough to be martyred."
00:12:19.250,00:12:23.083,"But with you, I know enough to stay alive."
00:12:28.750,00:12:30.834,You have a computer?
00:12:47.917,00:12:49.375,Yup.
00:12:49.417,00:12:50.667,"Hey, Ed, it's me."
00:12:50.709,00:12:53.291,"I got an Iraqi walk-in, up near Samarra."
00:12:53.333,00:12:57.166,He's got a communiqué video here that somebody walked across the Iranian border.
00:12:57.208,00:12:59.333,"I'm watching it right now, sir."
00:12:59.375,00:13:01.125,Can you see his face?
00:13:01.166,00:13:02.625,"Yes, captain."
00:13:02.667,00:13:04.250,I am looking at the white whale.
00:13:04.291,00:13:06.000,It is Al-Saleem.
00:13:06.041,00:13:07.166,What's he saying?
00:13:07.208,00:13:08.792,"Well, it's gotta be current."
00:13:08.834,00:13:10.792,He mentions the Sheffield bus bombings a week ago.
00:13:10.834,00:13:18.667,"He's telling the brothers to prepare for a UK operation's already planned, which is the bombing these people fucked up in Manchester this morning."
00:13:18.709,00:13:21.709,Let me translate this part for you directly.
00:13:24.542,00:13:28.333,FERRIS: We will avenge the America wars on the Muslim world.
00:13:30.375,00:13:32.709,We will come at them everywhere.
00:13:32.750,00:13:38.625,"We will strike at random, across Europe, then America, continually."
00:13:38.667,00:13:40.458,We have bled.
00:13:40.500,00:13:43.750,Now they will bleed. And bleed.
00:13:45.000,00:13:47.166,Until they are bled out.
00:13:49.709,00:13:50.875,Ed.
00:13:50.917,00:13:53.417,It's 6:00 in the morning.
00:13:53.458,00:13:55.333,"Saving civilization, honey."
00:13:55.375,00:13:57.333,Disks are passed from hand to hand.
00:13:57.375,00:13:59.959,"The communiqués are not transmitted, not copied."
00:14:00.000,00:14:03.667,My man says that real orders are verbal or in code on paper.
00:14:03.709,00:14:06.208,Is there any indication of where he is?
00:14:06.250,00:14:08.166,"No, sir."
00:14:08.208,00:14:09.667,He does not have his location.
00:14:09.709,00:14:15.166,"But he did mention there's a safe house up north, near Balad, where Al-Saleem may have been."
00:14:15.208,00:14:17.041,Dad?
00:14:17.083,00:14:18.667,Hey.
00:14:18.709,00:14:21.458,They're killing anyone who knows anything. He's scared.
00:14:21.500,00:14:24.250,We need to debrief him very carefully.
00:14:24.291,00:14:25.917,"All right, so do it."
00:14:25.959,00:14:26.959,In the States.
00:14:27.000,00:14:28.750,No.
00:14:28.792,00:14:30.875,They're already onto him.
00:14:30.917,00:14:32.750,"On the toilet, not the floor."
00:14:32.792,00:14:34.875,"You hear me, right?"
00:14:32.792,00:14:38.542,So he wants to come to America in one piece instead of going to paradise in a thousand.
00:14:38.583,00:14:40.333,"Well, he should've thought of that before."
00:14:40.375,00:14:43.250,"I'm telling you. They will kill him within a few days, Ed."
00:14:43.291,00:14:49.667,"Yep. And if they do, that's all right because we can be there to see who pulls the trigger."
00:14:49.709,00:14:52.208,"Now, get back to bed."
00:14:52.250,00:14:54.000,Am I missing the point?
00:14:54.041,00:14:56.125,I just offered him asylum.
00:14:56.166,00:14:57.959,"Well, you lied, buddy."
00:14:58.000,00:15:03.917,"So, uh, just cut him loose and put him back on the street."
00:15:05.166,00:15:06.417,All right.
00:15:14.041,00:15:17.291,"Uh, okay, so everything's fine."
00:15:17.333,00:15:21.500,"We just have to ask you a few more questions, and then, uh-- Then we can go."
00:15:21.542,00:15:23.583,"No, no more questions."
00:15:23.625,00:15:25.375,Maybe we could help you.
00:15:25.417,00:15:27.417,We have a few more questions.
00:15:27.458,00:15:30.792,Trust me. Okay?
00:15:32.583,00:15:35.291,You're a liar. You're a liar.
00:15:32.583,00:15:37.291,You fucking d-- Get on the fucking-- Back the fuck up!
00:15:37.333,00:15:38.625,Step back!
00:15:38.667,00:15:39.959,I talk to you!
00:15:40.000,00:15:41.375,And that's all you want!
00:15:41.417,00:15:42.917,"You want to see who kills me, huh?"
00:15:42.959,00:15:46.000,"Bassam. Search him, search him. Get his phone."
00:15:46.041,00:15:49.000,Now you've seen our faces.
00:15:49.041,00:15:50.583,Computer.
00:15:50.625,00:15:52.667,Guantanamo? You threaten me with Guantanamo?
00:15:52.709,00:15:57.417,"If you don't do exactly what I say, I will execute you right here."
00:15:57.458,00:16:01.125,"Listen, we are your friends, okay?"
00:16:01.166,00:16:03.583,We're your friends.
00:16:03.625,00:16:05.208,We're here to protect you.
00:16:05.250,00:16:07.500,You can't even protect yourselves.
00:16:10.125,00:16:19.500,"LANGLEY, VIRGINIA C.I.A. HEADQUARTERS Boss?"
00:16:19.542,00:16:20.709,"FERRIS: Yeah, I'm right here."
00:16:20.750,00:16:22.166,BASSAM: I got a visual on him.
00:16:22.208,00:16:24.333,"FERRIS: Okay, where's he coming from?"
00:16:24.375,00:16:25.917,BASSAM: He's riding up right now.
00:16:25.959,00:16:27.291,Coming right to us.
00:16:27.333,00:16:28.750,FERRIS: Yes. I see him. I see him.
00:16:28.792,00:16:30.417,BASSAM: He's coming down the street.
00:16:30.458,00:16:32.041,He's coming north towards the square.
00:16:32.083,00:16:33.750,I'm gonna hang back.
00:16:33.792,00:16:35.625,"BASSAM: All right, I'll let you know what he's doing."
00:16:35.667,00:16:37.208,Keep an eye on him for me.
00:16:37.250,00:16:40.166,He stopped in front of the café. He's walking up.
00:16:42.542,00:16:43.834,"FERRIS: Listen, Bassam?"
00:16:43.875,00:16:44.875,Yeah?
00:16:44.917,00:16:50.417,There is a black van heading this way with some pretty dangerous-looking guys.
00:16:50.458,00:16:52.542,They're staring right at him.
00:16:52.583,00:16:54.083,"Yeah, I see it."
00:16:54.125,00:16:55.375,FERRIS: Tell me what it does.
00:16:55.417,00:16:56.875,BASSAM: All right.
00:16:56.917,00:16:58.375,Looks like it's parking right up ahead.
00:16:58.417,00:17:00.166,"Yeah, it stopped."
00:17:00.208,00:17:01.917,FERRIS: Can I turn around?
00:17:01.959,00:17:04.458,"BASSAM: Yeah, yeah, Nizar's getting on his bike."
00:17:04.500,00:17:07.333,There's like four or five guys getting out of that van.
00:17:07.375,00:17:09.083,FERRIS: Can you identify these guys?
00:17:09.125,00:17:10.542,No. I've never seen them before.
00:17:10.583,00:17:11.667,We gotta move.
00:17:11.709,00:17:13.917,"MAN: Look, it's Nizar!"
00:17:30.792,00:17:32.917,MAN 1: Did you see a flash?
00:17:32.959,00:17:35.125,WOMAN: Did somebody get hit?
00:17:35.166,00:17:36.792,MAN 1: Let's see a playback on that.
00:17:36.834,00:17:39.083,MAN 3: Stay with him.
00:17:39.125,00:17:40.709,Hello.
00:17:40.750,00:17:42.667,"In case you didn't see it, I executed him, Ed."
00:17:42.709,00:17:44.333,HOFFMAN: You did what you had to do.
00:17:44.375,00:17:48.417,"If you hadn't, he would be describing you down to your eyebrows to them right now."
00:17:48.458,00:17:50.667,"Well, I did it, all right?"
00:17:50.709,00:17:53.458,He was always gonna get killed no matter what he did.
00:17:53.500,00:17:55.959,"Besides, you'd milked him and he was dry."
00:17:56.000,00:17:57.208,Excuse me.
00:17:58.250,00:17:59.834,Ferris?
00:17:59.875,00:18:01.959,Is your silence supposed to say something?
00:18:02.000,00:18:04.583,"Because you do know we're at war, right?"
00:18:04.625,00:18:13.875,"Now, your friend, who you must have had some intense cross-cultural eye contact with was a terrorist a-hole who, at his apex, turned out to be a coward who wanted to go to Disneyland."
00:18:13.917,00:18:17.542,"Listen, Ed, we're going north now, do you hear me?"
00:18:17.583,00:18:19.375,We're going north to the Balad safe house.
00:18:19.417,00:18:21.375,"No, no, no, buddy."
00:18:21.417,00:18:23.375,You're blown.
00:18:23.417,00:18:29.625,"Well, if I'm blown, Ed, that means you should've sent a team here the minute Nizar got shot, but you didn't send a team, did you?"
00:18:29.667,00:18:31.083,Did you?
00:18:31.125,00:18:33.333,"Well, not since we've been talking, Ferris."
00:18:33.375,00:18:36.500,"You and I, we're going to that safe house, you understand? Right now."
00:18:36.542,00:18:38.417,Ferris?
00:18:38.458,00:18:39.834,Let's get out of here.
00:18:39.875,00:19:12.583,"BALAD, IRAQ It's time to move. I'm coming back to you, all right?"
00:19:15.750,00:19:17.625,"If something happens, you'll shoot me right?"
00:19:17.667,00:19:20.166,Yep.
00:19:37.709,00:19:38.917,"Brother, can you help me?"
00:19:38.959,00:19:40.291,Please.
00:19:40.333,00:19:43.750,-My car broke down.
00:19:40.333,00:19:52.750,-Mehdi car broke down.
00:19:52.792,00:19:55.625,The engine....
00:19:55.875,00:19:56.750,Where you from?
00:19:56.792,00:19:59.625,From Baghdad.... Rasafa.
00:20:00.458,00:20:01.458,Search him.
00:20:03.041,00:20:04.458,Okay.
00:20:04.959,00:20:07.333,"BASSAM: Oh, I got you."
00:20:07.375,00:20:09.250,Don't you fucking do it.
00:20:10.750,00:20:12.375,Hassan! Hassan!
00:20:21.417,00:20:28.000,"BASSAM: Urgent request you dispatch Chili, Speck or Nitrate to these coordinates."
00:20:36.291,00:20:39.750,"North, 34 degrees, 20 minutes, 16.8 seconds."
00:20:39.792,00:20:43.542,"East, 44 degrees, 24 minutes, 14.4 seconds."
00:20:43.583,00:20:47.458,"This is a live target, a known operational base of an Al-Saleem cell."
00:20:47.500,00:20:48.750,A high value target.
00:20:48.792,00:20:50.208,"PILOT: Copy that, on approach."
00:21:13.125,00:21:14.667,Aah! Get back!
00:21:25.125,00:21:26.917,Come on! Get up!
00:21:26.959,00:21:29.375,Gotta go! Gotta go!
00:21:31.667,00:21:35.625,"Get in the fucking car, man!"
00:21:40.208,00:21:41.667,Aargh!
00:21:41.709,00:21:43.375,FERRIS: Go! Go!
00:21:52.959,00:21:54.375,I got guys coming down the hill!
00:21:54.417,00:21:55.750,Two trucks!
00:21:55.792,00:21:58.083,I got it.
00:21:58.125,00:21:59.417,Keep moving!
00:22:24.458,00:22:25.709,Fuck.
00:22:25.750,00:22:28.709,We're in some serious fucking trouble here.
00:22:28.750,00:22:30.834,"We're on Highway 1, south of Samarra."
00:22:30.875,00:22:32.291,We're being pursued by two vehicles.
00:22:32.333,00:22:35.166,We have valuable intel in our possession!
00:22:35.208,00:22:36.583,We're in a black Nissan.
00:22:36.625,00:22:38.208,Where the fuck are you people?
00:22:38.250,00:22:39.625,I see them!
00:22:39.667,00:22:40.875,PILOT: We're right on their six.
00:22:43.500,00:22:45.000,"PILOT: Have visual, will engage."
00:22:45.041,00:22:47.333,WOMAN: Copy. Engage at will.

00:23:08.667,00:23:10.375,RPG!
00:23:13.500,00:23:15.500,"MAN: Nine, one, two, six, one."
00:23:22.875,00:23:24.917,Let's go!
00:23:25.709,00:23:26.959,Fuel tank is ruptured!
00:23:27.000,00:23:28.583,I got him!
00:23:28.625,00:23:31.041,I can't!
00:23:31.083,00:23:33.625,Then get the bag!
00:23:33.667,00:23:35.000,Bassam! Bassam!
00:23:35.041,00:23:38.041,WOMAN: Stay with them. We are tracking.
00:23:39.959,00:23:41.000,Bassam!
00:23:41.041,00:23:42.583,SOLDIER: Get his legs!
00:23:42.625,00:23:43.959,No!

00:23:46.083,00:23:47.959,Let's go! Stay down.
00:23:48.000,00:23:50.208,"Come on, buddy."
00:23:50.250,00:23:52.792,"Come on. Get him out, now!"
00:24:07.750,00:24:08.875,MAN: He's dead.
00:24:14.083,00:24:15.166,DOCTOR: Who are you?
00:24:15.208,00:24:17.000,What's your name?
00:24:17.041,00:24:20.041,Do you know where you are?
00:24:20.083,00:24:21.542,Fuck.
00:24:36.542,00:24:37.875,What's that?
00:24:37.917,00:24:39.667,Bone fragments.
00:24:39.709,00:24:42.166,Not yours.
00:24:45.667,00:24:49.834,"U.S. MILITARY BASE - QATAR, PERSIAN GULF They get that stuff I sent out?"
00:24:49.875,00:24:51.750,All uploaded to Langley.
00:24:51.792,00:24:53.792,Mr. Hoffman.
00:24:55.667,00:24:56.583,"Hey, Ed."
00:24:56.625,00:24:57.625,Ferris.
00:24:57.667,00:24:59.041,"Christmas came early, buddy."
00:24:59.083,00:25:01.917,"Oh, yeah? What'd I get for Christmas, Ed?"
00:25:01.959,00:25:06.250,"Well, 15 pages of this, 40 pages of that."
00:25:06.291,00:25:16.917,"I got, like, about 712 phone numbers that are new to us that we can strip and evaluate, and amongst other things, a safe house in Amman."
00:25:16.959,00:25:21.709,I've got jihadists coming and going from this place like it's happy hour at the Cat House.
00:25:21.750,00:25:22.917,You gotta see this place.
00:25:22.959,00:25:27.834,"Before we get into any of that, I wanna know what you're doing for Bassam's family, Ed."
00:25:27.875,00:25:29.208,I didn't know the man.
00:25:29.250,00:25:31.000,What are you doing for Bassam's family?
00:25:31.041,00:25:32.166,He was your guy.
00:25:32.208,00:25:33.917,"So now you don't know him, huh?"
00:25:35.166,00:25:40.333,You'll be going to Amman as acting station chief.
00:25:40.375,00:25:41.875,"No matter what he says, you're the show-runner."
00:25:41.917,00:25:46.709,"You'll liaise with Jordanian GID, who are as hot for Al-Saleem as we are."
00:25:46.750,00:25:51.959,"You'll be working with a guy named Hani Salaam, who is not your run-of-the-mill fingernail-puller."
00:25:52.000,00:25:53.583,Hani is a professional.
00:25:53.625,00:25:55.625,And will I be sharing information with him?
00:25:55.667,00:25:58.667,Let me say this about that: No.
00:25:58.709,00:26:01.834,"Now, you wanna take a few weeks off and go bang the wife?"
00:26:01.875,00:26:04.709,"I'm getting a divorce, Ed."
00:26:04.750,00:26:06.542,You know more about it than I do.
00:26:06.583,00:26:08.417,"Everybody around here screws up their marriage, buddy."
00:26:08.458,00:26:10.208,Why not you?
00:26:10.250,00:26:12.333,So you'll go to Amman?
00:26:15.417,00:26:17.208,I will go to Amman.
00:26:17.250,00:26:18.667,I'll call you later.
00:26:51.458,00:27:00.375,"AMMAN, JORDAN This car is a real pile of shit."
00:27:00.417,00:27:02.333,Is this the best they could afford?
00:27:02.375,00:27:05.500,"I brought this car in case you wanted to cruise the safe house now, you know?"
00:27:05.542,00:27:09.583,"Hey, no one cruises that safe house, all right?"
00:27:09.625,00:27:16.542,"Look, I need to take a shit, I need a shower, and an Internet connection, so just take me to my apartment, all right?"
00:27:16.583,00:27:18.917,Got you in a high-rise.
00:27:18.959,00:27:21.875,Hot and cold water.
00:27:21.917,00:27:23.000,Great.
00:27:23.041,00:27:24.500,There's not much local color.
00:27:24.542,00:27:27.083,I've had it with the local color. Thank you.
00:27:43.041,00:27:44.750,Cheap-ass motherfuckers.
00:27:50.291,00:27:52.208,"GUARD 1: Morning, sir."
00:27:52.250,00:27:53.250,GUARD 2: He's clear.
00:27:54.625,00:28:01.542,U.S. EMBASSY - AMMAN NSA is listening to all the phones and computer links of anyone who's been near the house.
00:28:01.583,00:28:05.208,FERRIS: Now look they don't have to be geniuses to stop using their e-mail and cell phones.
00:28:05.250,00:28:11.375,I just don't understand why you haven't figured out that they're not communicating electronically anymore.
00:28:11.417,00:28:14.166,The house is owned by a family named Alousi.
00:28:14.208,00:28:19.667,"And in my opinion, it just seems like a normal Jordanian family with a lot of country relatives."
00:28:19.709,00:28:21.500,Normal Jordanian family.
00:28:21.542,00:28:27.250,"But all of them are unmarried males between the ages of 18 and 35, correct?"
00:28:27.291,00:28:33.166,"Listen, kid, whatever information you got in Iraq, I just don't think this house is what you think it is."
00:28:33.208,00:28:37.500,"These boys drink alcohol, they chase girls, they smoke hash and..."
00:28:37.542,00:28:39.000,"So did Mohamed Atta, right?"
00:28:39.041,00:28:41.458,It's Takfir methodology.
00:28:41.500,00:28:45.667,Correct. It's permitted in order to deceive the infidel.
00:28:45.709,00:28:53.834,"Now, you've had plenty of guys watching them go in and out of this safe house here, but what I don't get is why you haven't had anyone monitoring them after they leave."
00:28:53.875,00:29:00.000,"Well, there's so much activity at this location that we have exhausted the station's indigenous-appearing manpower."
00:29:00.041,00:29:04.917,"So you don't have enough good Arab guys to follow the bad Arab guys, is what you're saying."
00:29:04.959,00:29:08.500,"Well, you're gonna need some more human surveillance."
00:29:08.542,00:29:10.750,Loaners from Jordanian Intelligence.
00:29:10.792,00:29:12.625,"All right. Skip, get out."
00:29:19.917,00:29:31.500,"Now, I am in receipt of a directive, which tells me that I am to make myself useful to you in whichever way that you request or require."
00:29:31.542,00:29:38.667,But it is my feeling that to involve the Jordanian secret service is a breach of operational integrity.
00:29:38.709,00:29:42.083,"You don't need to tell me about Jordanian Intelligence, right?"
00:29:42.125,00:29:44.875,"They are doing a far superior job than you are, my friend."
00:29:44.917,00:29:50.625,"Now, you've read that directive there, which clearly states that I am in charge of this operation."
00:29:50.667,00:29:55.125,"So, what I need you to do is leave this office immediately and hand your entire staff over to me."
00:29:57.291,00:30:00.750,"You know, we've all watched your rise in the Near East Division."
00:30:02.500,00:30:04.625,I'll see you on the way down.
00:30:04.667,00:30:07.583,You and Hoffman both.
00:30:17.917,00:30:24.417,"I need you to help me out and get me a fresh pot of coffee, please, and a full staff meeting within the next 15 minutes, all right?"
00:30:24.458,00:30:29.583,"SKIP: To be fair to Mr. Holiday, Mr. Ferris, Mr. Hoffman never told us this would be such a big deal."
00:30:29.625,00:30:31.792,Ed Hoffman is the head of the Near East Division.
00:30:31.834,00:30:36.625,"But he does not know shit until he steals it from the guy on the ground, and that's me, okay?"
00:30:36.667,00:30:43.500,"Now, please stop acting like such a fucking ingénue and try to get me a meeting with Hani Salaam. Thanks."
00:30:45.625,00:31:01.500,G.I.D. COMPLEX - JORDANIAN GENERAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE Mr. Ferris.
00:31:14.959,00:31:16.417,Hani Pasha.
00:31:16.458,00:31:19.583,Pasha?
00:31:19.625,00:31:23.083,"Well, I hear you like it, sir."
00:31:23.125,00:31:25.166,"Mr. Ferris, please take a seat."
00:31:25.208,00:31:27.125,"Thank you, sir."
00:31:28.875,00:31:30.959,Welcome to our promising country.
00:31:31.000,00:31:32.375,Thank you so much.
00:31:32.417,00:31:37.125,As reliable as your Ed Hoffman would call a towelhead monarchy can be.
00:31:37.166,00:31:40.375,"Well, we'll leave that to Ed Hoffman, sir."
00:31:40.417,00:31:41.750,Hmm.
00:31:45.125,00:31:47.208,What have you heard about this building?
00:31:47.250,00:31:52.583,"Well, to be quite honest, I hear they call it the, uh, fingernail factory."
00:31:52.625,00:31:55.375,"But no one close to you would say that, of course."
00:31:55.417,00:31:56.917,No.
00:31:56.959,00:32:00.750,But people are stupid.
00:32:00.792,00:32:04.417,Torture... doesn't work.
00:32:04.458,00:32:11.041,"Under torture, a man will say almost anything to make the pain stop."
00:32:11.083,00:32:13.333,"You have experience with this, I am sure."
00:32:16.083,00:32:21.333,"Mr. Ferris, here in Jordan, to the fundamentalists, you see, I am, myself, the enemy."
00:32:21.375,00:32:25.125,Perhaps the worst kind.
00:32:25.166,00:32:28.208,Take not the Jews and Christians as allies.
00:32:28.250,00:32:30.750,"Do you know it, Mr. Ferris?"
00:32:30.792,00:32:35.834,"If any of you take them as allies, then surely he is one of them."
00:32:35.875,00:32:38.500,The dar-al-Harb. Very good.
00:32:38.542,00:32:42.500,"We are together, Hani Pasha, in this House of War, yes."
00:32:42.542,00:32:45.834,You are smarter than the Americans who are usually sent to Amman.
00:32:45.875,00:32:46.959,"Thank you, sir."
00:32:47.000,00:32:49.709,"I knew this, of course, before you came."
00:32:49.750,00:32:53.709,"You are young, but you respect your elders."
00:32:53.750,00:32:57.417,You speak Arabic-- Hmm.
00:32:57.458,00:32:59.291,Hmm.
00:33:06.959,00:33:08.333,Now... Ahem.
00:33:08.375,00:33:13.542,We've recently discovered a large Al-Saleem safe house and training cell here in Amman.
00:33:13.583,00:33:17.000,"I would need your help with surveillance, sir."
00:33:17.041,00:33:18.792,"Now, this is what we know so far."
00:33:21.375,00:33:23.542,This is unusual.
00:33:23.583,00:33:27.750,Your Ed Hoffman would rather have less information than share what he has with me.
00:33:27.792,00:33:31.417,"Well, this is not Ed Hoffman."
00:33:31.458,00:33:34.583,"This is me, sir."
00:33:46.625,00:33:52.375,"HANI: I have one rule if we are to cooperate, my dear."
00:33:52.417,00:33:54.000,Never lie to me.
00:33:56.041,00:33:59.959,Understand? Never lie to me.
00:34:04.375,00:34:06.417,You shall have your agents.
00:34:06.458,00:34:08.500,"Thank you, sir."

00:34:37.375,00:34:38.917,Come on.
00:34:43.959,00:34:45.458,What do you wanna do with this guy?
00:34:45.500,00:34:46.834,FERRIS: Just watch him.
00:34:46.875,00:34:50.792,Watch him and what else?
00:34:50.834,00:34:53.583,I'm not sure about this GID surveillance.
00:34:53.625,00:34:55.917,I can't see any of Hani's guys.
00:34:55.959,00:34:57.625,"Well, I've spotted a few so far."
00:34:57.667,00:35:01.458,You see the two by the doorway there in front of the safe house?
00:35:01.500,00:35:03.041,There's one more selling radios.
00:35:03.083,00:35:05.000,And there's one behind me with a striped shirt.
00:35:05.041,00:35:07.667,That's what I've clocked so far.
00:35:09.917,00:35:12.625,Who's this? Who just sat down?
00:35:12.667,00:35:14.417,SKIP: That's one of our guys.
00:35:14.458,00:35:17.917,One of your guys? What do you--?
00:35:17.959,00:35:19.667,Zayed Ibishi.
00:35:19.709,00:35:22.333,He's one of our contacts from the Palestinian camps.
00:35:22.375,00:35:23.917,"FERRIS: Station asset, huh?"
00:35:23.959,00:35:26.417,What the fuck is he doing making contact right now?
00:35:26.458,00:35:28.083,And how come I don't know about this?
00:35:28.125,00:35:30.458,I don't know.
00:35:30.500,00:35:35.208,"FERRIS: If he makes that jihadist suspicious, they will shut down that safe house and leave."
00:35:35.250,00:35:36.750,He's gonna get that guy killed.
00:35:36.792,00:35:38.875,He's gonna blow this whole goddamn operation.
00:35:38.917,00:35:41.333,Not again. Fucking Hoffman!

00:37:00.125,00:37:04.500,"I got bit by fuckin' diseased dogs, goddamn it."
00:37:04.542,00:37:06.625,I'm by the clearing.
00:37:06.667,00:37:09.125,"Yeah, just look out for me."

00:37:22.959,00:37:24.542,Rabies around here is no joke.
00:37:24.583,00:37:27.375,"You're gonna need a jab in there, ASAP. Let's go."
00:37:27.417,00:37:29.041,Let's go.
00:37:33.875,00:37:37.375,Let's get you vaccinated.
00:37:52.834,00:37:54.709,What happend?
00:37:55.583,00:37:56.917,Broken glass.
00:37:56.959,00:37:58.583,Let me see.
00:38:01.458,00:38:03.417,These are not bite wounds.
00:38:03.458,00:38:05.959,"Uh, a-- A snowboarding accident."
00:38:06.000,00:38:07.959,Snowboarding.
00:38:08.000,00:38:09.792,"You're accident prone, huh?"
00:38:09.834,00:38:14.458,"Well, I mean, I'm sure it looks that way. Yeah."
00:38:14.500,00:38:16.458,Okay.
00:38:23.083,00:38:24.875,Relax.
00:38:25.875,00:38:29.542,All right. Let me...
00:38:29.583,00:38:33.000,You're Iranian.
00:38:34.417,00:38:37.542,My father was Iranian.
00:38:38.583,00:38:41.458,I live in Amman now.
00:38:44.709,00:38:47.375,Okay.
00:38:47.417,00:38:49.333,This is going to hurt.
00:38:49.375,00:38:51.458,Hmm.
00:38:51.500,00:38:54.208,Just think about something else.
00:38:55.166,00:38:56.792,Aah.
00:38:57.709,00:38:59.792,Okay.
00:38:59.834,00:39:05.291,"Okay, this is the first of five anti-rabies injections you'll need over the next month."
00:39:05.333,00:39:07.041,And you don't need to come back here.
00:39:07.083,00:39:10.583,You can get them at any clinic.
00:39:10.625,00:39:12.166,Hmm.
00:39:12.208,00:39:13.375,So we're--? We're done?
00:39:13.417,00:39:14.625,"Yeah, we're done."
00:39:14.667,00:39:17.583,And someone will come to bandage your wounds.
00:39:18.792,00:39:20.166,Thank you.
00:39:20.208,00:39:21.792,You fucking cocksucker.
00:39:21.834,00:39:27.041,How the hell do you expect me to run an operation when you're running a side operation which fucks up my own?
00:39:27.083,00:39:30.625,"Now, listen, you want me to run Amman, let me run Amman, all right?"
00:39:30.667,00:39:33.166,I have made promises to Hani Salaam.
00:39:33.208,00:39:34.125,Do you understand that?
00:39:34.166,00:39:35.458,Uh-huh. What's your point?
00:39:35.500,00:39:37.375,Stay. Wait.
00:39:35.500,00:39:39.083,"My point is, Ed, you can't pull your normal bullshit here, all right?"
00:39:39.125,00:39:40.959,We have to respect what he wants.
00:39:41.000,00:39:43.250,I do respect him.
00:39:43.291,00:39:48.166,"Look, you keep fucking around like this, Ed, and you are gonna blow this entire Amman operation."
00:39:48.208,00:39:50.125,I love you. Bye.
00:39:50.166,00:39:54.458,"...these mother fuckers will vacate their only known safe house, and we'll never hear from them again Ed."
00:39:54.500,00:39:55.583,Do you understand that?
00:39:55.625,00:39:57.041,I'm just trying to back you up buddy.
00:39:57.083,00:39:59.250,"It's a dangerous, dangerous world out there."
00:39:59.291,00:40:02.500,"Well, don't back me up, 'cause I don't need it, all right?"
00:40:02.542,00:40:04.250,Hani.
00:40:04.291,00:40:07.500,"Look, I gotta go deal with this Hani bullshit now all right So go fuck yourself."
00:40:07.542,00:40:09.500,"All right, whatever."
00:40:11.417,00:40:12.750,You ready to go?
00:40:12.792,00:40:14.500,Whatever.
00:40:31.792,00:40:40.208,"Hani Pasha, if you would give me an opportunity to ex-- Fortunately the safe house is still there."
00:40:40.250,00:40:44.250,"As for the man you killed, you were right."
00:40:44.291,00:40:45.667,You made a good decision.
00:40:45.709,00:40:50.000,"The jihadists believe it was a robbery, and there are many robberies in that district."
00:40:50.041,00:40:52.875,"So you have been very clever, my dear."
00:40:52.917,00:40:55.166,"Well, that's-- That's good news, sir."
00:40:55.208,00:41:00.000,"Listen, Ed Hoffman had-- I have spoken to Mr. Hoffman very sharply."
00:41:00.041,00:41:03.417,"Now, we will explain the king's espionage laws to his agent."
00:41:23.500,00:41:26.959,"I thought you didn't believe in torture, Hani Pasha."
00:41:27.000,00:41:31.000,"This is punishment, my dear."
00:41:35.333,00:41:36.583,Keep watching.
00:41:38.667,00:41:40.834,HANI: Tell Edward what you have seen.
00:41:50.500,00:42:59.500,"AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS NOORDERMARKT Another deadly attack on innocent civilians."
00:42:59.542,00:43:03.792,This time in one of Amsterdam's most crowded tourist districts.
00:43:03.834,00:43:07.625,The images of the bombing were captured on location surveillance cameras.
00:43:07.667,00:43:09.834,The blast felt for miles.
00:43:09.875,00:43:15.333,What was once a block-long farmer market vibrant with color is now in ruins and covered with ash.
00:43:17.125,00:43:24.041,"The exact number of casualties is not yet known, as emergency crews are still pulling victims from the rubble."
00:43:21.709,00:43:26.792,But officials are saying it will certainly be in triple figures.
00:43:26.834,00:43:39.583,KLPD antiterror-unit investigators have arrived and are examining bomb fragments in the hope of determining if this and the other recent bombings on the continent and in the UK are connected.
00:43:39.625,00:43:46.417,The consequence of a new bombing will no doubt have a devastating effect on Europe's tourist business.
00:43:46.458,00:43:50.250,Let's go now to Amsterdam's chief of police.
00:43:50.291,00:43:58.834,"CHIEF: We will do whatever we can to keep everyone safe, for you to live every day without being afraid."
00:43:58.875,00:44:01.125,But we must be realistic.
00:44:01.166,00:44:07.125,"Terrorist threats are real, present, deadly and persistent."
00:44:09.125,00:44:10.417,"Good morning, sir."
00:44:10.458,00:44:11.959,Good morning.
00:44:13.959,00:44:15.083,Where are we going?
00:44:15.125,00:44:17.375,We are going fishing.
00:44:17.417,00:44:19.000,Get in.
00:44:25.917,00:44:31.417,"Since no credit was claimed for the bombing in Amsterdam, we believe it to be the work of Al-Saleem."
00:44:31.458,00:44:35.000,That's his signature. Anonymity.
00:44:35.041,00:44:37.458,"So, what we need is, uh-- May I say we?"
00:44:37.500,00:44:41.208,Of course. As long as we keep it between us.
00:44:41.250,00:44:44.417,We need a man inside the Amman cell.
00:44:44.458,00:44:45.917,We do. Yes.
00:44:45.959,00:44:47.709,And we shall have the man we need.
00:44:47.750,00:44:49.000,How's that?
00:44:49.041,00:44:51.583,Because you gave him to me.
00:44:52.792,00:44:54.667,HANI: His name is Mustafa Karami.
00:44:54.709,00:44:59.625,I've known him since he was a teenager selling boom boxes from the back of a stolen truck.
00:44:59.667,00:45:03.166,Now he's al Qaeda.
00:45:03.208,00:45:05.542,"Watch and learn, my dear."
00:45:05.583,00:45:07.458,Watch and learn.
00:45:38.208,00:45:41.709,Karami... God is great.
00:45:42.583,00:45:44.041,What do you want?
00:45:45.500,00:45:49.583,You did not think to tell Hani Salaam you are a jihadist?
00:45:49.625,00:45:53.041,You have become a religious man. Hmm?
00:45:53.083,00:45:55.125,No longer a thief.
00:45:55.166,00:45:57.875,Can it be true?
00:45:57.917,00:45:59.875,Here.
00:46:01.333,00:46:05.542,Take the phone.
00:46:05.583,00:46:07.625,Talk.
00:46:10.417,00:46:12.125,Hello? Hello?
00:46:12.166,00:46:14.250,Hello.
00:46:14.291,00:46:17.625,HANI: His mother was in the Palestinian camps.
00:46:17.667,00:46:21.500,Now she has a fine apartment and a beautiful garden.
00:46:21.542,00:46:25.125,She can watch the sun set over the hills.
00:46:25.166,00:46:30.291,"She has a refrigerator, couch, even a television set."
00:46:30.333,00:46:37.000,"She will tell him she is proud of him, that she always knew he would be a success even when he was a little boy in the refugee camps."
00:46:37.041,00:46:38.875,And now he has sent her money.
00:46:38.917,00:46:41.041,She is glad he is no longer mixed up with the radicals.
00:46:46.125,00:46:47.875,Thanks to God.
00:46:55.250,00:46:58.750,"You are God's blessing to your mother, Mustafa."
00:46:58.792,00:47:00.625,You have done none of these things for her.
00:47:00.667,00:47:02.417,But you should have.
00:47:02.458,00:47:05.959,A mother is worth more than anything they have told you.
00:47:06.000,00:47:13.125,"You know, you will be better in the future, because we have sent her many gifts, and we have told her these gifts come from her son."
00:47:14.959,00:47:17.000,What do you want me to do?
00:47:17.041,00:47:19.291,Be a good Muslim.
00:47:19.333,00:47:22.417,Continue your life with your brothers in al Qaeda.
00:47:22.458,00:47:24.709,We will devise a way to talk.
00:47:26.458,00:47:29.542,"Come. No, no, no."
00:47:29.583,00:47:32.583,"Up, up, up."
00:47:34.875,00:47:36.709,Go.
00:47:42.917,00:47:52.750,"HANI: And so we throw him back into the sea, to swim where he naturally swims, to learn what he naturally learns, and see how long he remembers my benevolence."
00:47:53.875,00:47:56.500,And what if he forgets?
00:47:56.542,00:48:06.333,"If he forgets, I remind him that I have the power of life and death over him, because, you see, any time I wish, I can let them know he works for me."
00:48:06.375,00:48:08.125,Hmm.
00:48:11.417,00:48:12.542,Ed?
00:48:12.583,00:48:14.000,HOFFMAN: So tell me about Hani's guy.
00:48:14.041,00:48:15.166,Who?
00:48:15.208,00:48:16.667,"HOFFMAN: Karami, the guy on the bike."
00:48:16.709,00:48:18.625,"What do you think I do in my spare time, play tennis?"
00:48:18.667,00:48:20.625,I look like a tennis player to you?
00:48:20.667,00:48:22.333,"It's not gonna happen, Ed."
00:48:22.375,00:48:28.291,"Buddy, we're a results-oriented organization, and we need results now, because otherwise I will be unhappy."
00:48:28.333,00:48:30.792,"You'll be unhappy, and he'll say, Insa."
00:48:30.834,00:48:31.959,What does that mean?
00:48:32.000,00:48:33.583,"Means too fucking bad, is what it means."
00:48:33.625,00:48:35.250,Too fucking bad?
00:48:35.291,00:48:37.375,"Europe is gettin' hammered, boy. All right?"
00:48:37.417,00:48:39.583,Nobody knows where the next bomb is going off.
00:48:39.625,00:48:41.583,There's 75 dead in Amsterdam.
00:48:41.625,00:48:43.959,"You can call me sentimental if you want to, buddy..."
00:48:44.000,00:48:46.125,"Ed, listen, Hani does not trust you."
00:48:46.166,00:48:48.208,Arabs will only help you if they trust you.
00:48:48.250,00:48:50.458,"Now, we need to earn that trust, you understand?"
00:48:50.500,00:48:52.250,"What are you, moving here?"
00:48:52.291,00:48:53.959,I don't care about cultural insecurity issues.
00:48:54.000,00:48:56.125,I don't care if Hani trusts me or not.
00:48:56.166,00:48:59.208,What he will do is he will thank me in the long run. Fuck.
00:48:59.250,00:49:01.583,Hold on. Hold on.
00:49:03.250,00:49:06.000,"Buddy, you're home."
00:49:06.041,00:49:09.291,"Oh, Jesus Christ, Ed, you scared the shit out of me."
00:49:09.333,00:49:12.375,"HOFFMAN: You know, they say that you should never drink red wine in the desert."
00:49:12.417,00:49:14.000,"That's what did in the Babylonians, right?"
00:49:14.041,00:49:18.417,"Well, a couple of bottles of that and we'll be speaking Babylonian."
00:49:18.458,00:49:21.542,So how was your flight?
00:49:21.583,00:49:25.500,"Oh, it was fine. It was fine."
00:49:26.750,00:49:30.291,I see you've made yourself at home.
00:49:44.500,00:49:51.208,"In the words of the great Sam Snead: If you're not thinking about pussy, you're just not concentrating."
00:49:51.250,00:49:52.500,My dear.
00:49:52.542,00:49:54.458,FERRIS: Jesus Christ. Come on.
00:49:56.959,00:50:00.417,Hani Pasha. Thank you for your time.
00:50:00.458,00:50:01.750,Please.
00:50:01.792,00:50:05.583,I'm gonna need a piece of this guy you got here in this Amman cell.
00:50:05.625,00:50:08.417,Don't look at buddy.
00:50:08.458,00:50:12.709,"These jihadists might not use their cell phones, Hani, but you do use yours, right?"
00:50:12.750,00:50:14.542,Please.
00:50:14.583,00:50:17.375,"HOFFMAN: Now, don't say no before I say anything."
00:50:17.417,00:50:21.000,Just let me say what I've come here to say.
00:50:21.041,00:50:26.542,Thank you. You have done an incredible job developing this guy Karoobi.
00:50:26.583,00:50:28.125,K-Katoomi.
00:50:28.166,00:50:30.250,Karami.
00:50:30.291,00:50:35.000,"Now, we develop these assets to use them as needed."
00:50:35.041,00:50:36.583,And I have a need.
00:50:36.625,00:50:38.333,No.
00:50:42.041,00:50:43.875,I'm just gonna get all frustrated here.
00:50:43.917,00:50:45.625,"HANI: Why are you frustrated, Edward?"
00:50:45.667,00:50:47.458,Because we have a partnership.
00:50:47.500,00:50:51.875,"You have something that I need that will help me, and you won't allow that to happen."
00:50:51.917,00:50:55.208,And I'm trying to impress upon you a sense of urgency.
00:50:55.250,00:50:59.917,Urgency does not call for changing methods that work for methods that do not work.
00:50:59.959,00:51:02.667,"Now, who pays the bills around here?"
00:51:02.709,00:51:05.834,I would hate to have to have my president call your king.
00:51:05.875,00:51:08.458,Because that's just gonna be embarrassing for all of us.
00:51:08.500,00:51:12.458,"In matters of intelligence, Edward, you are speaking to the king."
00:51:12.500,00:51:14.417,HOFFMAN: Is that right?
00:51:14.458,00:51:18.917,"Well, Your Highness, I want control."
00:51:18.959,00:51:20.667,As a favor to the United States.
00:51:20.709,00:51:23.792,You can't have it.
00:51:23.834,00:51:28.291,"I could tell you we will run him jointly, but it would not be the truth."
00:51:28.333,00:51:32.250,"Real intelligence operations, they remain secret forever."
00:51:32.291,00:51:38.542,"Heh. You Americans, you are incapable of secrecy because you are a democracy."
00:51:38.583,00:51:41.875,"Now, I know my business."
00:51:41.917,00:51:44.542,"I have never failed you, have I?"
00:51:44.583,00:51:47.834,"No, you have not."
00:51:47.875,00:51:49.917,Are you sure you wanna make this the first time?
00:51:49.959,00:51:52.917,"HANI: Edward, you're missing the point."
00:51:52.959,00:51:54.917,"Karami, he doesn't know anything."
00:51:54.959,00:51:57.709,That is not the way the organization operates.
00:51:57.750,00:52:01.834,I will ask him what he knows when it is time.
00:52:01.875,00:52:03.875,"Now, are you happy?"
00:52:03.917,00:52:05.250,I'm gettin' there.
00:52:07.250,00:52:12.083,"Now, you guys might have invented algebra, but we're the guys that found out how to use it."
00:52:12.125,00:52:15.375,I presume you know who that is?
00:52:15.417,00:52:17.959,It's a recent photograph of Al-Saleem.
00:52:18.000,00:52:19.792,"You didn't have that one, did you?"
00:52:19.834,00:52:22.750,That's yours. You can keep that because we're partners.
00:52:22.792,00:52:26.959,"All right? Now, I'm fulfilling my side of the bargain, okay?"
00:52:27.000,00:52:31.917,Now's the time for some reciprocity.
00:52:31.959,00:52:33.959,You need to give me Karami.
00:52:40.250,00:52:41.834,Insa.
00:52:41.875,00:52:45.000,"That's, uh, Too fucking bad."
00:52:45.041,00:52:46.875,I know what that means.
00:52:47.375,00:52:51.000,"Well, that was fuckin' embarrassing. Hmm?"
00:52:51.041,00:52:53.208,"You still thinking about pussy, Ed?"
00:52:53.250,00:52:54.709,HOFFMAN: Don't be a smart aleck.
00:52:54.750,00:52:57.667,"Thing about that Hani, he's bright."
00:52:57.709,00:53:00.083,But he's also arrogant.
00:53:00.125,00:53:02.917,"You're talking about him, right?"
00:53:02.959,00:53:04.750,"Just flow with me, buddy."
00:53:04.792,00:53:07.834,Jesus Christ. You have a recent photograph of Al-Saleem.
00:53:07.875,00:53:10.500,"Don't you think I could've used intel like that, Ed?"
00:53:10.542,00:53:13.542,What the hell else are you holding back from me?
00:53:13.583,00:53:15.000,What do you wanna know?
00:53:15.041,00:53:16.917,"Well, for one thing, what's his real name?"
00:53:16.959,00:53:20.000,Kareem Al-Shams.
00:53:20.041,00:53:21.750,His birthplace?
00:53:21.792,00:53:25.000,Syria. Hamas.
00:53:25.792,00:53:27.417,Background?
00:53:27.458,00:53:34.583,"Well, his loving middle-class family got killed by Hafez Assad, so he moved to Saudi Arabia."
00:53:34.625,00:53:39.083,"Studied physics and engineering in Riyadh, then here in Amman."
00:53:39.125,00:53:41.834,Post-graduate study at the University of North Carolina.
00:53:41.875,00:53:43.291,He's a Tar Heel just like you.
00:53:43.333,00:53:47.291,"Now, he prides himself on his humility and not having to take the credit."
00:53:47.333,00:53:53.667,"Yet this is the same man who will go on videotape with his brothers, describing what he's done and what's gonna come."
00:53:53.709,00:53:56.875,His is a false humility.
00:53:56.917,00:54:00.917,"His ego is more powerful than his beliefs, more dangerous."
00:54:00.959,00:54:02.792,And that is his weakness.
00:54:02.834,00:54:08.542,"Now, all we got to do, Ferris, is just get that fucker on the phone."
00:54:12.709,00:54:13.792,FERRIS: Ed?
00:54:13.834,00:54:15.458,Yeah.
00:54:15.500,00:54:17.417,"Don't do anything about Karami, huh?"
00:54:17.458,00:54:20.083,Don't try to flip him or anything like that.
00:54:20.125,00:54:21.667,Hani will throw me out of the country.
00:54:21.709,00:54:24.291,I promise you that.
00:54:25.333,00:54:29.959,You cannot trust Hani.
00:54:30.000,00:54:33.000,You're clear.
00:54:33.041,00:54:36.500,"Good. Now, you and I gotta get really drunk 'cause I need to sleep on the plane."
00:54:36.542,00:54:40.250,I have to take the kids to The Lion King. Again.
00:54:41.375,00:54:42.500,Never have kids.
00:54:43.667,00:54:46.834,"Ed, did you hear what I said, right?"
00:54:46.875,00:54:48.625,"Oh, yeah."
00:54:46.875,00:54:49.709,D-Don't-- Don't touch Karami.
00:54:49.750,00:54:52.250,All right.
00:54:52.291,00:54:55.000,Never.
00:55:10.542,00:55:13.375,That's Karami. We're on.
00:55:45.125,00:55:47.500,SKIP: Move the fucking van!
00:55:49.834,00:55:52.208,"Go! Go, go, go!"
00:55:58.959,00:56:00.291,Fuck!
00:56:11.083,00:56:14.500,I thought I told you you could get this at any clinic.
00:56:14.542,00:56:19.208,And you should have had your injection yesterday.
00:56:19.250,00:56:21.542,You weren't on duty yesterday.
00:56:21.583,00:56:26.041,"Besides, when you find a good doctor, you don't change, right?"
00:56:26.083,00:56:27.458,I'm not a doctor.
00:56:28.458,00:56:31.500,"Nurse, doctor, engineer, imam...."
00:56:31.542,00:56:33.542,The same thing.
00:56:34.834,00:56:36.041,Wife.
00:56:36.083,00:56:39.083,"Well, I don't have a ring."
00:56:39.125,00:56:41.875,"No, but you did last week."
00:56:41.917,00:56:44.333,Ah. So you noticed?
00:56:45.417,00:56:47.917,Bad husband.
00:56:47.959,00:56:49.333,Aah.
00:56:49.375,00:56:50.917,Yes. Ahem.
00:56:50.959,00:56:56.458,"And she was an even worse wife, which is why we're divorced now."
00:56:56.500,00:56:57.875,"It's, uh-- It's over."
00:57:01.375,00:57:03.542,"And now you're looking for something else, huh?"
00:57:03.583,00:57:07.333,Something as different from her as you can find.
00:57:07.375,00:57:11.166,Something close to impossible.
00:57:11.208,00:57:13.625,We're done.
00:57:13.667,00:57:15.125,FERRIS: Till next week.
00:57:15.166,00:57:17.000,God willing.
00:57:18.041,00:57:19.583,God willing.
00:57:23.291,00:57:25.041,May I?
00:57:25.083,00:57:26.083,Yes.
00:57:28.166,00:57:35.083,"I was, uh, wondering if maybe you wanted to have a conversation sooner than next week."
00:57:35.125,00:57:41.834,"Maybe, inshallah, later this afternoon if-- If that wouldn't make you uncomfortable."
00:57:41.875,00:57:51.792,"Well, for you and me to be able to do that, first we would have to have a conversation about the proper way to have a conversation."
00:57:51.834,00:57:58.291,"Anyway, where I'm going this afternoon would make you more uncomfortable than me."
00:57:58.333,00:58:01.542,"Well, I-- I doubt that."
00:58:01.583,00:58:03.542,I don't.
00:58:03.583,00:58:35.542,JABAL AL-HUSSEIN PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMP Who's the Jew?
00:58:40.875,00:58:48.417,"FERRIS: If you're trying to figure out how far I'll go in order to express my interest, I think you have the answer."
00:58:48.458,00:58:50.542,Do I?
00:58:50.583,00:58:54.125,What else are you supposed to do at this point? Leave here alone?
00:58:54.166,00:58:57.709,You're safer with me and you know it.
00:58:57.750,00:59:00.542,FERRIS: What are you asking?
00:59:00.583,00:59:02.625,I'm asking what you do here.
00:59:02.667,00:59:06.166,"Well, I'm-- I'm a political adviser."
00:59:06.208,00:59:07.875,Who snowboards in Amman.
00:59:07.917,00:59:10.458,That's right.
00:59:10.500,00:59:14.792,"Listen, I have a thing to tell you, an important one."
00:59:14.834,00:59:18.166,A man is not his job.
00:59:18.208,00:59:21.709,"I mean, he's apart from his job. The man."
00:59:21.750,00:59:23.667,I understand.
00:59:23.709,00:59:29.834,"No, I just want you to know my feeling, my-- Heh. My understanding of you."
00:59:29.875,00:59:31.208,"Well, thank you."
00:59:31.250,00:59:33.417,You're welcome.
00:59:41.709,00:59:44.333,"May I see you again, Aisha?"
00:59:52.291,00:59:55.333,"When you wish and with your permission, of course."
00:59:55.375,00:59:58.375,Where did you learn to speak Arabic like this?
00:59:59.667,01:00:02.500,"Yeah, yeah, we are friends."
01:00:02.542,01:00:04.750,We may talk again.
01:00:04.792,01:00:06.625,We may. Heh.
01:00:06.667,01:00:08.959,"Well, thank you."
01:00:13.542,01:00:16.542,"-Marwan, hello."
01:00:17.083,01:00:20.208,I must take my friend to her home.
01:00:20.250,01:00:23.625,He's a patient at my hospital.
01:00:23.667,01:00:25.458,"Don't worry, he's-- He's my friend."
01:00:25.500,01:00:28.000,He's my friend.
01:00:28.041,01:00:29.917,It's fine. It's fine.
01:00:29.959,01:00:31.959,You sure?
01:00:32.000,01:00:33.500,It's fine.
01:00:34.875,01:00:36.417,FERRIS: What's this all about?
01:02:06.542,01:02:08.542,Marwan showed you the burning house?
01:02:10.083,01:02:11.417,Do you know what happened?
01:02:11.458,01:02:13.959,I have absolutely no idea.
01:02:15.166,01:02:17.083,"You see, you could have said to me yes or no."
01:02:17.125,01:02:19.083,Simply that.
01:02:19.125,01:02:22.959,"When a man says to me more than yes or no, then I begin to wonder."
01:02:23.000,01:02:26.375,"I don't know what happened, Hani."
01:02:28.083,01:02:30.041,HANI: We had the advantage.
01:02:30.083,01:02:34.542,That house could have led us to Al-Saleem.
01:02:34.583,01:02:36.000,Everything inside it is gone.
01:02:36.041,01:02:37.875,MAN: Here. Kneel.
01:02:36.041,01:02:40.709,"Hani, listen to me, I-- I told you never to lie to me."
01:02:40.750,01:02:42.667,"I am not lying to you, Hani."
01:02:42.709,01:02:50.583,"HANI: You did not know that this man, after everything I said to you, everything I said to Edward, that he tried to take Karami?"
01:02:50.625,01:02:52.917,He did not know. Ugh!
01:02:52.959,01:02:56.750,"When I want to speak with you, I will look at you."
01:02:56.792,01:02:59.333,Now I am talking to Mr. Ferris.
01:02:59.375,01:03:05.000,"So in as few words as possible, did you know?"
01:03:05.041,01:03:06.792,No.
01:03:06.834,01:03:09.625,I don't believe you.
01:03:09.667,01:03:12.083,You have 12 hours to leave Jordan.
01:03:12.125,01:03:17.333,"If I find you here, I will not be responsible for your safety."
01:03:32.917,01:03:36.000,"Now, you knew you needed to adapt to this environment."
01:03:36.041,01:03:47.166,"Ferris, I know, but, you know, I-- SKIP: Ferris!"
01:03:53.375,01:03:54.875,Ferris!
01:03:59.458,01:04:03.291,"WASHINGTON, D.C."
01:04:11.750,01:04:13.250,"HOFFMAN: Well, hey, buddy."
01:04:13.291,01:04:15.583,Back from the sandbox?
01:04:15.625,01:04:17.291,How you enjoying civilization?
01:04:17.333,01:04:18.375,You wanna go get a hot dog?
01:04:18.417,01:04:21.500,"How do you expect me to operate, huh, Ed, when you're keeping all the cards to your chest?"
01:04:21.542,01:04:22.792,What about an ice cream?
01:04:22.834,01:04:24.208,"All Hani wanted was patience, Ed."
01:04:24.250,01:04:25.500,Patience.
01:04:24.250,01:04:27.333,Not as a personal quality-- I don't care.
01:04:27.375,01:04:30.875,"Not as a personal quality, but an operational requirement, and you can't do it?"
01:04:30.917,01:04:32.291,You are too power hungry and greedy.
01:04:32.333,01:04:34.041,You fucked this whole operation up!
01:04:34.083,01:04:36.750,"For chrissakes, I thought Hani wanted to kill me!"
01:04:36.792,01:04:38.333,"Oh, don't exaggerate."
01:04:38.375,01:04:41.500,Hani don't want to kill you.
01:04:41.542,01:04:42.625,He likes you a lot.
01:04:42.667,01:04:46.709,And who is he gonna get over there better for him than you? Nobody.
01:04:46.750,01:04:48.083,So don't worry about it.
01:04:48.125,01:04:50.125,You're gonna be back in Jordan before you know it.
01:04:50.166,01:04:54.542,"Back with your Jordanian piece of poontang that you think I don't know about, but I do."
01:04:56.041,01:04:57.834,"You're a fat fucking piece of shit, you know that, Ed?"
01:04:57.875,01:05:01.333,"We do this shit for a living, go on a diet, for chrissakes."
01:05:01.375,01:05:02.709,Are you quite finished?
01:05:02.750,01:05:05.625,"Now, I did what I had to do."
01:05:07.083,01:05:12.417,"I ain't got time to play Patience, Sidi, Patience, and sit around eating couscous."
01:05:14.583,01:05:18.583,Hani's interests extend only to his own little fiefdom.
01:05:18.625,01:05:20.208,Mine are global.
01:05:21.709,01:05:30.000,"Now, having said that, I admit that perhaps, possibly, I should have, from an operational standpoint brought you into what I was doing."
01:05:30.041,01:05:31.917,Exactly.
01:05:31.959,01:05:33.709,What you should've done was listen to what Hani said in the first place.
01:05:33.750,01:05:35.125,and you know that.
01:05:38.000,01:05:40.792,"You know, 10 years ago, I could've beat the crap out of you."
01:05:40.834,01:05:42.792,Should've taken the shot when you had the chance.
01:05:42.834,01:05:45.417,Maybe I should've.
01:05:46.333,01:05:53.625,"What we need to do, with or without the cooperation of Hani, is get our own man inside Al-Saleem's tent."
01:05:55.208,01:06:00.792,We could penetrate every goddamn Salafi mosque in the world and still not even get close.
01:06:05.083,01:06:07.375,"But Al-Saleem doesn't know that, right?"
01:06:07.417,01:06:09.208,What?
01:06:09.250,01:06:12.083,"I mean, heh, he doesn't know what we can't do."
01:06:12.125,01:06:14.208,He doesn't know how close or how far we are.
01:06:14.250,01:06:16.250,He doesn't know what's true or what isn't.
01:06:16.291,01:06:22.166,"I mean-- Look, Osama fed Zarqawi to the dogs because he was getting too powerful, right?"
01:06:22.208,01:06:23.542,Right.
01:06:23.583,01:06:34.041,"What if instead of tracking Al-Saleem like we're doing right now with absolutely no results, we make it appear that there is another terrorist operation out there just as effective as his own?"
01:06:34.083,01:06:37.834,"I mean, how-- How would Al-Saleem react to that kind of challenge to his stats?"
01:06:37.875,01:06:38.917,What would he do?
01:06:38.959,01:06:40.542,He would get paranoid.
01:06:40.583,01:06:42.208,He might rejoice. Maybe both.
01:06:42.250,01:06:43.792,Exactly.
01:06:43.834,01:06:46.291,"But either way, he'd try to get in contact with them, right?"
01:06:46.333,01:06:47.667,Right.
01:06:47.709,01:06:49.375,Which would be us.
01:06:50.208,01:06:52.250,That would be us.
01:06:53.291,01:06:56.792,Heh. You're a devious S.O.B.
01:06:56.834,01:06:58.333,We can't do this out of Langley.
01:06:58.375,01:06:59.834,"No. No, sir."
01:07:20.458,01:07:22.291,Garland. Roger Ferris.
01:07:22.333,01:07:23.792,Pleased to meet you.
01:07:23.834,01:07:25.250,Where's Hoffman?
01:07:25.291,01:07:27.625,I don't know.
01:07:30.500,01:07:32.625,He trusts you.
01:07:32.667,01:07:33.750,I don't trust him.
01:07:33.792,01:07:40.000,Every time we run an operation and I don't see Hoffman it means he's running another operation.
01:07:40.041,01:07:41.625,Coffee?
01:07:41.667,01:07:44.291,Black. Thank you.
01:07:44.333,01:07:46.542,"Fruit? Strawberries, plums, apples?"
01:07:46.583,01:07:49.250,"No, thanks."
01:07:49.291,01:07:51.333,We're tracking a cell in Syria.
01:07:51.375,01:07:53.834,"Last night, they were in Damascus."
01:07:53.875,01:07:57.041,"Today, Dayr Az-Zawr and the Iraqi border."
01:07:57.083,01:08:00.583,But something tells me they won't make it to Hasbaya.
01:08:00.625,01:08:02.875,"We have, uh..."
01:08:02.917,01:08:05.125,...ninjas waiting.
01:08:05.166,01:08:08.250,Who do these ninjas work for?
01:08:08.291,01:08:09.709,Me.
01:08:09.750,01:08:11.667,Shall we?
01:08:19.500,01:08:22.750,"So, uh, where is everyone?"
01:08:22.792,01:08:24.834,Absolutely no idea what you mean.
01:08:24.875,01:08:27.083,What? You mean it's just you?
01:08:27.125,01:08:30.625,No. It's me and you.
01:08:30.667,01:08:35.458,Did you think there'd be some sort of war room with lights flashing and people running around with clipboards?
01:08:35.500,01:08:37.333,"No, it's all here and here and here."
01:08:37.375,01:08:38.333,And here.
01:08:38.375,01:08:40.375,Sure you won't have a strawberry?
01:08:40.417,01:08:41.667,They're really delicious.
01:08:41.709,01:08:43.750,"Yeah, no, I'm-- I'm positive."
01:08:43.792,01:08:48.166,"All right, look, I'm gonna need some really, really low-level al Qaeda contacts, all right?"
01:08:48.208,01:08:49.792,No one too extreme.
01:08:49.834,01:08:51.917,Picture somewhere in between Osama and Oprah.
01:08:51.959,01:08:53.750,You get my drift?
01:08:53.792,01:08:56.709,"I'm gonna need a security consultant, a lawyer."
01:08:56.750,01:09:01.291,"I'm gonna need an Arab who travels a lot throughout the region, all right? A businessman."
01:09:01.333,01:09:04.917,"Someone who fits the role of jihadist without actually being jihadist, you know?"
01:09:04.959,01:09:06.291,A straw man.
01:09:07.333,01:09:11.208,"Receiving money, making plans."
01:09:11.250,01:09:13.959,That kind of thing.
01:09:14.000,01:09:16.333,"Okay, no."
01:09:16.375,01:09:18.041,No.
01:09:18.083,01:09:19.583,No.
01:09:20.917,01:09:23.834,Hang on. There you go.
01:09:23.875,01:09:25.166,Omar Sadiki.
01:09:25.208,01:09:27.417,He's Jordanian.
01:09:27.458,01:09:33.500,"Uh, most of his commissions are from charitable Islamic groups, who then give money to the jihadists."
01:09:33.542,01:09:39.041,"So he ticks all the jihadist boxes, except he's innocent."
01:09:39.083,01:09:42.291,So he touches his head to the floor five times a day.
01:09:42.333,01:09:44.875,He believes in God.
01:09:44.917,01:09:48.417,So why would he trade with an infidel like myself?
01:09:50.458,01:09:51.667,Money.
01:09:56.792,01:10:16.250,DUBAI UNITED ARAB EMIRATES Mr. Sadiki.
01:10:18.875,01:10:21.000,"Hello, Mr. Sadiki."
01:10:21.041,01:10:24.041,"Mr. Sadiki, it's Brad Scanlon from Hayes Andover Bank."
01:10:24.083,01:10:26.625,I'm following up on my e-mail.
01:10:26.667,01:10:28.041,Yeah.
01:10:28.083,01:10:30.917,"Yeah, well, listen, I got into Dubai a little bit early."
01:10:30.959,01:10:37.250,"I'm staying at the Jumeirah Emirates Towers, but I can meet you anywhere."
01:10:37.291,01:10:39.125,"Well, fantastic."
01:10:46.375,01:10:48.000,TONY: Anything else to know?
01:10:48.041,01:10:49.625,FERRIS: Exactly as we discussed.
01:10:49.667,01:10:51.208,I'm cool with that.
01:10:51.250,01:10:52.333,I'm used to knowing nothing.
01:10:52.375,01:10:53.500,"I'm sure you are, Tony."
01:10:53.542,01:10:54.917,Just get in position.
01:10:54.959,01:10:56.500,"Okay, boss."
01:10:58.500,01:11:00.250,FERRIS: Mr. Sadiki.
01:11:00.291,01:11:05.375,So Hayes Andover's option to buy this property is gonna expire by the end of the month.
01:11:05.417,01:11:10.667,"We're hoping to get some preliminary sketches and a rough bid by, say, next Thursday before the Islamic weekend."
01:11:10.709,01:11:12.583,"Well, I think, uh..."
01:11:12.625,01:11:14.125,"Yes, certainly."
01:11:14.166,01:11:19.000,You'll also have to sign a letter of intent with our attorney Mr. Al-Masri if that's okay with you.
01:11:19.041,01:11:20.667,Makes no difference to me.
01:11:20.709,01:11:23.333,Allah will decide if I get the job or not.
01:11:23.375,01:11:25.875,Fantastic.
01:11:25.917,01:11:28.166,Mr. Al-Masri?
01:11:28.208,01:11:29.291,Mr. Omar Sadiki.
01:11:35.917,01:11:37.166,Would anyone like some coffee?
01:11:37.208,01:11:38.583,"Yes, please. Thank you."
01:11:38.625,01:11:42.041,"FERRIS: Ed, Al-Masri is a lawyer we found with al Qaeda ties."
01:11:42.083,01:11:44.959,"He's fairly low on the map, but he is on the map."
01:11:45.000,01:11:49.417,Enough for a photograph to suggest Sadiki's guilt by association.
01:11:49.458,01:11:51.500,Mm-hm. You have his computer?
01:11:51.542,01:11:54.250,"Yeah, look, I'm gonna go get it right now."
01:11:54.291,01:11:55.750,He's going out to the Cyclone Club.
01:11:55.792,01:11:57.083,He loves the Russian girls.
01:11:57.125,01:12:00.041,I'll call you soon.
01:12:01.000,01:12:02.959,Three-sixteen.
01:12:45.875,01:12:47.208,"Come on, baby."
01:12:52.667,01:12:54.083,Garland?
01:12:54.125,01:12:56.417,Yeah?
01:12:57.417,01:12:59.625,Just getting in right now.
01:13:10.291,01:13:11.375,Ah.
01:13:11.417,01:13:13.959,This is useful.
01:13:14.000,01:13:16.250,Very useful.
01:13:16.291,01:13:21.667,I have a-- An e-mail list of the members of the Brothers of Awareness.
01:13:21.709,01:13:23.291,The Brothers of who-the-fuck?
01:13:23.333,01:13:25.208,The Ikhwan Ishfan.
01:13:25.250,01:13:27.458,They're just a study group of believers at his local mosque.
01:13:27.500,01:13:29.458,But I can make it look like anything.
01:13:29.500,01:13:32.959,"All right. Let's make it look like everything, huh?"
01:13:40.583,01:13:48.458,"Now, make fake accounts for half a dozen of the brothers and start transferring money to them from Sadiki's fake receiver account."
01:13:48.500,01:13:50.667,Just small operational sums.
01:13:50.709,01:13:52.041,Okay.
01:13:55.542,01:14:01.875,"The Saudis will pick up the money moving, and everything they pick up-- They'll leak to the jihadists."
01:14:01.917,01:14:03.333,"FERRIS: You got it, my friend."
01:14:03.375,01:14:04.834,GARLAND: It's coming up.
01:14:04.875,01:14:06.000,Now it's done.
01:14:42.417,01:14:44.917,Dad!
01:14:44.959,01:14:46.375,Dad!
01:14:46.417,01:14:48.250,"Hey, baby."
01:14:50.959,01:14:52.792,"Hey, Ed, you there?"
01:14:52.834,01:14:54.291,Where are you?
01:14:54.333,01:14:55.959,Dubai International.
01:14:56.000,01:14:57.458,"No, no, no."
01:14:57.500,01:14:59.458,"No, you're not."
01:14:59.500,01:15:01.125,"Hani called, asked where you were."
01:15:01.166,01:15:02.709,Jesus Christ.
01:15:02.750,01:15:05.834,"So, uh, if you don't go back, he's gonna wonder why you didn't go back."
01:15:05.875,01:15:08.417,"I think he likes you, buddy."
01:15:08.458,01:15:10.375,"All right, Ed. I'm on my way."
01:15:10.417,01:15:11.583,HOFFMAN: All right.
01:15:11.625,01:15:13.208,"Oh, hey. Can I get that for you?"
01:15:13.250,01:15:14.500,Thank you.

01:15:43.250,01:15:44.792,I was upset.
01:15:44.834,01:15:46.917,"Well, you had every right to be upset, sir."
01:15:46.959,01:15:49.000,I apologize for what happened.
01:15:49.834,01:15:52.750,But I am happy you are back.

01:16:15.291,01:16:19.000,"Well, thanks so much, Mr. Sadiki."
01:16:19.041,01:16:21.583,"All right, let's get something clear, all right?"
01:16:21.625,01:16:24.166,"I'm not tolerating any more of your bullshit, understand?"
01:16:24.208,01:16:25.625,"No, it's cool."
01:16:25.667,01:16:27.709,I work for you.
01:16:27.750,01:16:29.000,"All right, good."
01:16:29.041,01:16:31.625,Front? Back?
01:16:44.041,01:16:54.208,"If you're going to insist on coming here to see me which is what you're doing, my sister's going to want to meet you."
01:16:55.709,01:16:57.250,Y-Your sister?
01:16:57.291,01:17:02.333,"Yeah, my sister looks after me in matters that are non-medical."
01:17:04.208,01:17:08.709,"Oh, so she has to approve of me before you will begin to."
01:17:09.709,01:17:14.000,"I would like her to think so, whenever I can."
01:17:15.750,01:17:16.959,Okay.

01:17:52.417,01:17:53.500,Hi.

01:17:55.125,01:17:56.542,Come in.
01:17:56.583,01:17:57.834,"I brought some, uh, dessert, pastry."
01:17:57.875,01:18:00.375,"Oh, the kids are going to love it."
01:18:00.417,01:18:02.417,The kids? Aha.

01:18:39.625,01:18:41.000,It's not good?
01:18:41.041,01:18:42.875,You don't like your mother's cooking?
01:18:42.917,01:18:44.291,"No, not really."
01:18:44.333,01:18:45.750,Oh.
01:18:51.750,01:18:54.208,What kind of food do you like?

01:18:59.917,01:19:04.542,"So if there's anything that I wouldn't like, would you two let me know?"
01:19:06.291,01:19:07.750,Okay.
01:19:07.792,01:19:08.959,Cool.
01:19:23.333,01:19:27.875,"CALA: So, Mr. Ferris, how long are you in Amman?"
01:19:28.583,01:19:32.125,"Oh, uh, ahem, well, I think I'm gonna be for a while."
01:19:32.166,01:19:34.709,"I hope so, anyway."
01:19:36.041,01:19:38.000,Where were you stationed before?
01:19:39.333,01:19:40.542,Riyadh.
01:19:41.375,01:19:42.792,Riyadh?
01:19:47.083,01:19:49.792,CALA: What do you do exactly?
01:19:49.834,01:19:54.166,"AISHA: I told you, Cala, he's a political adviser."
01:19:54.208,01:19:56.166,Political adviser.
01:19:56.208,01:19:59.667,But what does that mean?
01:19:59.709,01:20:07.542,"It means, uh-- It means-- It means that I-- Well, I offer my assistance to His Majesty's advisers whenever they ask."
01:20:11.542,01:20:13.500,Eat your food.
01:20:13.542,01:20:16.875,"But you do this now, not before the war."
01:20:16.917,01:20:19.875,Before you didn't consult with us at all.
01:20:19.917,01:20:22.041,"Cala, please, we are just having lunch."
01:20:22.083,01:20:23.583,It's okay. It's okay.
01:20:23.625,01:20:26.250,AISHA: We can talk-- I'm talking with your friend.
01:20:26.291,01:20:27.875,"Okay, we can talk about another subject."
01:20:27.917,01:20:29.792,It's quite all right.
01:20:29.834,01:20:37.667,"And we understand that the, uh, the situation in Iraq has created many hardships for the-- For the Jordanian people."
01:20:37.709,01:20:40.417,The situation?
01:20:40.458,01:20:41.542,He means war.
01:20:41.583,01:20:43.166,He says the situation.
01:20:43.208,01:20:45.083,"What do you mean about that, huh?"
01:20:45.125,01:20:46.458,AISHA: Cala-- Please.
01:20:46.500,01:20:47.959,FERRIS: I mean the roadside bombings.
01:20:48.000,01:20:57.458,"The assassination of Iraqi police, the kidnappings, the crowded marketplaces and innocent families that have been wiped off the face of the Earth."
01:20:57.500,01:20:59.542,That's what I mean by the situation in Iraq.
01:21:02.750,01:21:06.667,I can tell you what His Majesty's thinking.
01:21:06.709,01:21:10.709,His Majesty believes the best hope for the war is that it ends.
01:21:10.750,01:21:14.083,"Well, I can tell you that is my hope as well."
01:21:14.125,01:21:16.208,"I hope so too, huh?"
01:21:16.250,01:21:18.709,Cala? Hey. Peace.
01:21:20.333,01:21:23.208,"AISHA: Let's have lunch, huh?"
01:21:23.250,01:21:25.000,Enjoy.
01:21:25.041,01:21:26.583,Thank you.
01:21:29.542,01:21:31.083,"Well, sorry about that."
01:21:31.125,01:21:33.917,"Oh, so am I, I-- I probably should've kept my mouth shut."
01:21:33.959,01:21:36.083,"After all, I was a guest in your home."
01:21:36.125,01:21:37.291,So is she.
01:21:37.333,01:21:38.917,"It didn't stop her, you know?"
01:21:38.959,01:21:41.834,She suffered a lot during Iran-Iraq war.
01:21:41.875,01:21:46.083,And the funny thing is that she wants to live in America.
01:21:46.125,01:21:47.709,"Oh, yeah?"
01:21:47.750,01:21:49.750,"Well, tell her I'll switch passports with her."
01:21:49.792,01:21:51.625,It'll make us both happy.
01:21:51.667,01:21:53.250,Don't joke about these kind of things.
01:21:53.291,01:21:55.417,"Oh, I'm not joking."
01:21:55.458,01:21:57.208,I may-- I may stay here forever.
01:21:57.250,01:21:58.583,Really.
01:21:59.583,01:22:02.417,"Well, anyway, I'm-- I'm glad I made friends with her boys."
01:22:02.458,01:22:03.542,I like them a lot.
01:22:03.583,01:22:04.917,"Yeah, they're great, aren't they?"
01:22:04.959,01:22:07.083,"But not very good spies, you know?"
01:22:07.125,01:22:08.542,Neither are you.
01:22:08.583,01:22:10.208,What do you mean?
01:22:10.250,01:22:11.959,Oh.
01:22:12.000,01:22:13.250,So you noticed.
01:22:13.291,01:22:15.417,All right. I'm busted.
01:22:15.458,01:22:18.083,"Well, thank you, Aisha, for inviting me in your home."
01:22:18.125,01:22:19.834,Really.
01:22:25.375,01:22:26.625,Sorry.
01:22:27.709,01:22:29.500,I had a really nice time.
01:22:29.542,01:22:31.375,"Sorry. Yeah, yeah, me too."
01:22:31.417,01:22:33.792,Thank you for coming.
01:22:44.333,01:22:48.625,HANI: The photograph was taken last week in the Cyclone Club in Dubai.
01:22:48.667,01:22:55.500,"One is Al-Masri, a lawyer a low-level al Qaeda financier, if that's not a contradiction in terms."
01:22:55.542,01:22:58.166,The other is a Jordanian.
01:22:58.208,01:23:01.291,An architect named Omar Sadiki.
01:23:02.000,01:23:04.000,No known terrorist ties.
01:23:04.041,01:23:09.375,"Now, the question I ask myself is-- Is what are they doing together?"
01:23:14.709,01:23:18.375,Is this Sadiki more than he claims to be?
01:23:18.417,01:23:19.709,He travels a lot.
01:23:19.750,01:23:23.000,He builds mosques and shopping malls.
01:23:23.041,01:23:26.291,"At the very least, he bears examination by us."
01:23:26.333,01:23:28.625,Or by we.
01:23:28.667,01:23:29.959,Hmm.
01:23:31.709,01:23:34.083,Where'd you get these?
01:23:34.125,01:23:35.583,A friend in Saudi Intelligence.
01:23:35.625,01:23:37.083,Hmm.
01:23:37.125,01:23:38.750,"Useful friend, huh?"
01:23:47.792,01:23:49.667,"No, keep it."
01:23:49.709,01:23:52.083,I want you to have it.
01:23:52.125,01:23:53.792,We are partners.
01:23:53.834,01:23:56.375,"Allies, no?"
01:23:56.417,01:23:59.417,Why would we not want to help each other?
01:23:59.458,01:24:01.458,Right. Thank you.
01:24:02.709,01:24:04.792,Yeah?
01:24:04.834,01:24:08.333,"All right, now, pull up an Arabic keyboard and write down this message, you ready?"
01:24:08.375,01:24:09.792,Okay.
01:24:09.834,01:24:11.875,"In the name of Go-- No, you know what, strike that."
01:24:11.917,01:24:23.208,"In the name of God the merciful, we praise our brothers who shall carry out this heroic act in the fig orchard and beg God to give us strength for our continuing struggle."
01:24:23.250,01:24:24.625,The time is at hand.
01:24:24.667,01:24:25.834,All right?
01:24:25.875,01:24:29.583,"Now, that's absolutely delightful Arabic, but what the fuck is the fig orchard?"
01:24:29.625,01:24:31.041,"No, I can't let you in on that yet."
01:24:31.083,01:24:32.583,Let's just say it's developing.
01:24:32.625,01:24:37.709,"Okay, it'll create chatter but it's gotta be big enough for Al-Saleem, to get his attention."
01:24:37.750,01:24:39.375,"Oh, it'll be big."
01:24:39.417,01:24:44.750,"Now, send that off from Sadiki's fake e-mail address and we are in business."
01:24:44.792,01:24:47.125,Okay. Done.
01:24:52.709,01:25:01.000,"INCIRLIK, TURKEY Advise when you're on the deck."
01:25:11.625,01:25:13.166,"FERRIS: Hello there, Mr. Sadiki."
01:25:13.208,01:25:14.625,It's Brad Scanlon.
01:25:14.667,01:25:16.625,"Well, I'm fine."
01:25:16.667,01:25:18.250,But we've got a bit of a problem.
01:25:18.291,01:25:24.875,"Yes, you see, our chief engineer, who's based out of Ankara, he's-- he's raised some issues about the insulation."
01:25:24.917,01:25:31.959,"I realize it's the same stuff that you use in Saudi Arabia, sir, but he's-- He's asked to meet with you immediately."
01:25:32.000,01:25:34.875,"No, I'm sorry, sir."
01:25:34.917,01:25:38.583,And the only time he can meet is tomorrow afternoon.
01:25:38.625,01:25:42.291,"But the good news is, we have a car ready to pick you up in about..."
01:25:42.333,01:25:47.875,"Oh, six hours, and a plane ticket to Turkey waiting for you at the airport."
01:25:47.917,01:25:51.792,"No, I'm sorry, sir."
01:25:51.834,01:25:54.375,"Ed, Sadiki just landed in Turkey."
01:25:54.417,01:25:56.375,He's being met by one of our guys.
01:25:56.417,01:26:00.041,An engineer to discuss business and to show him a good time.
01:26:00.083,01:26:02.667,All we need is to establish that he is there.
01:26:02.709,01:26:03.917,Mm-hm.
01:26:03.959,01:26:07.542,"Now, the barracks at the base have been cleared out of all personnel."
01:26:07.583,01:26:09.500,Unclaimed bodies from the morgue have been brought in.
01:26:09.542,01:26:12.291,They'll be our so-called casualties.
01:26:12.333,01:26:17.291,"Now, Garland will send out a message from Sadiki hinting that a strike is prepared."
01:26:17.333,01:26:21.959,And when the strike is done he'll post another message taking responsibility for our little event.
01:26:22.000,01:26:23.417,You got that?
01:26:23.458,01:26:24.542,Mm-hm.
01:26:24.583,01:26:32.750,"After that, hopefully a buzz of messages will then pass among jihadists' networks, announcing the Brothers of Awareness as a new player."
01:26:34.375,01:26:36.834,And our Sadiki as its leader.
01:26:36.875,01:26:38.709,"HOFFMAN: All right, Ferris. Thank you."
01:26:38.750,01:26:40.583,"MAN: Tony, you have a go."
01:26:47.041,01:26:49.291,We have a special report.
01:26:49.333,01:26:51.917,"A massive explosion has taken place in Incirlik, Turkey."
01:26:51.959,01:26:57.125,Officials have confirmed the target of the blast to be the U.S. Air Base...
01:26:57.166,01:26:59.625,"...at Incirlik, Turkey."
01:26:57.166,01:27:04.583,"The bomb ripped through the Bachelor Officers' Quarters at 3:00 this morning, engulfing it in flames."
01:27:04.625,01:27:07.500,No one yet has claimed responsibility for the attack.
01:27:07.542,01:27:20.625,"But terror experts are already speculating this is the work of a new much more sophisticated and much better financed offshoot of al Qaeda than that which is responsible for the recent bombings in Amsterdam, London, and other European cities."
01:27:20.667,01:27:26.375,In contrast to these recent bombings this is the first attack to occur on American property.
01:27:26.417,01:27:27.959,The Pentagon...
01:27:28.000,01:27:30.041,...the names of the dead Huh?
01:27:30.083,01:27:31.667,until notification of next of kin.
01:27:31.709,01:27:35.041,We're also being told that there may never be a public announcement...
01:27:35.083,01:27:36.792,Hani.
01:27:36.834,01:27:41.625,...since some of the men killed may have been stationed at Incirlik on classified missions.
01:27:41.667,01:27:48.625,"Incirlik, which in Turkish means fig orchard, has served since September the 11th as a primary hub in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq."
01:27:48.667,01:27:52.375,"All right, now send out the message taking credit."
01:27:52.417,01:27:56.208,But make the responses go back to Sadiki's actual account.
01:27:56.250,01:27:58.250,You got that?
01:28:03.917,01:28:08.709,"I can't say it's been real, but you know what I mean."
01:28:08.750,01:28:10.083,Yeah.
01:28:27.000,01:28:31.667,This is the man who has been receiving our money?
01:28:31.709,01:28:35.542,And it seems he blew up the U.S. Air Base in Turkey.
01:28:41.125,01:28:44.166,He looks like an accountant.
01:28:44.875,01:28:47.417,He's an architect in Amman.
01:28:48.333,01:28:49.750,Successful.
01:28:50.750,01:28:53.166,Without a doubt.
01:28:59.041,01:29:01.917,"Mr. Omar, you have mail..."
01:29:01.959,01:29:04.875,"Excuse me, it will just take a second."
01:29:22.750,01:29:52.834,"Congratulations brother in your endeavors to destroy the great Satan. -JIHADBOY2 You have struck at the heart of their evil designs -DOMINO2SUZ God will reward you for what you have done. -TITUS_9_KARIM We rejoice on this day! - R2ZAER_KM8 Thanks God for you, and for all the Brothers of Awareness."
01:29:47.500,01:31:46.625,"-SABER07DRVR Hey there, little buddy."
01:31:46.667,01:31:48.834,Well done. You did it.
01:31:48.875,01:31:50.875,NSA's picking up all kinds of chatter.
01:31:50.917,01:31:52.667,Haven't heard for years.
01:31:52.709,01:31:55.667,One voice in particular on a world phone out of Vienna sounds a lot like Al-Saleem himself.
01:31:55.709,01:31:59.333,"Saying something along the lines of, Who the damn heck is Omar Sadiki?"
01:31:59.375,01:32:02.625,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look-- Listen, I made a decision, Ed."
01:32:02.667,01:32:03.792,I'm bringing him in.
01:32:03.834,01:32:04.917,Who?
01:32:04.959,01:32:06.750,"Omar Sadiki, that's who."
01:32:06.792,01:32:08.542,"Oh, come on. No, no, no."
01:32:08.583,01:32:11.750,"When they find him, they are gonna torture him and they are gonna kill him."
01:32:11.792,01:32:14.709,You gotta decide which side of the cross you're on.
01:32:14.750,01:32:16.208,"I need nailers, not hangers."
01:32:16.250,01:32:18.458,"Decision's already done, Ed."
01:32:18.500,01:32:21.917,"Ain't nobody innocent in this shit, Ferris. Okay?"
01:32:22.875,01:32:24.041,Ferris.
01:32:24.083,01:32:27.417,"FERRIS: All right, don't move until I say, all right?"
01:32:33.125,01:32:34.500,You got me?
01:32:41.375,01:32:43.458,Omar.
01:32:43.500,01:32:45.750,We need to have a conversation.
01:32:45.792,01:32:48.291,Come on.
01:32:48.333,01:32:50.417,"You have to trust me, Omar."
01:32:52.959,01:32:56.542,Fuck! Omar!
01:32:56.583,01:32:57.875,Let's go!
01:32:57.917,01:33:00.417,"Omar, listen to me!"
01:33:00.458,01:33:02.667,Omar! Omar!
01:33:02.709,01:33:05.208,"Let's go! Go, go, go!"
01:33:17.667,01:33:19.458,Fuck!
01:33:26.542,01:33:29.709,This is Roger Ferris.
01:33:36.875,01:33:39.250,God praises you for your work.
01:33:43.166,01:33:46.166,MAN: The Sheikh praises you for your work.
01:33:46.208,01:33:51.166,The House of Islam rejoices at the strike you have made against the House of War.
01:33:51.208,01:33:55.208,I don't know what you're talking about.
01:33:55.250,01:33:59.458,-I'm an architect.
01:33:59.500,01:34:01.792,We've read your statements...
01:34:01.834,01:34:05.834,...taking credit for what you did at Incirlik.
01:34:07.083,01:34:08.875,You don't have to pretend.
01:34:08.917,01:34:11.333,We congratulate you.
01:34:13.125,01:34:15.959,Someone else is doing something to me....
01:34:17.458,01:34:20.583,Someone else is doing something to me I don't understand.
01:34:20.625,01:34:21.959,I don't understand!
01:34:23.250,01:34:25.208,-The American.
01:34:25.250,01:34:27.917,"Yes, the American."
01:34:31.917,01:34:34.333,The American pretended to want me to design a bank.
01:34:34.375,01:34:38.959,He wanted it to look Islamic.
01:34:40.667,01:34:43.875,You are a pious man.
01:34:43.917,01:34:46.125,We will believe you.
01:34:46.166,01:34:49.166,Tell us about this American.
01:35:30.500,01:35:32.792,Yeah.
01:35:32.834,01:35:34.709,Sadiki is dead.
01:35:36.291,01:35:38.083,You there?
01:35:38.125,01:35:39.834,"Yeah, I'm here."
01:35:39.875,01:35:41.875,"I didn't kill him, buddy."
01:35:41.917,01:35:43.291,"I know you didn't, Ed."
01:35:44.625,01:35:46.000,I did.
01:35:46.041,01:35:47.375,"Oh, buddy."
01:35:47.417,01:35:49.792,"Buddy, that's just not constructive. Okay?"
01:35:49.834,01:35:51.250,Then what is?
01:35:51.291,01:35:53.250,Doing exactly what you're doing.
01:35:53.291,01:35:54.750,And how are you measuring that?
01:35:54.792,01:35:56.917,By how much closer you've gotten to Al-Saleem?
01:35:56.959,01:36:00.291,"I bet you heard a shitload of chatter, then it stopped, didn't it?"
01:36:00.333,01:36:02.208,That's right.
01:36:02.250,01:36:04.542,"Well, then where is Al-Saleem?"
01:36:04.583,01:36:06.125,Hmm?
01:36:06.166,01:36:07.834,Ferris.
01:36:07.875,01:36:09.000,You know what?
01:36:09.041,01:36:10.667,Heh. I've had it.
01:36:10.709,01:36:12.959,I've had it.
01:36:13.000,01:36:14.542,"Yes, you can."
01:36:14.583,01:36:17.417,"Now, you just get yourself a couple of hours' sleep."
01:36:17.458,01:36:19.500,And you call me when you're thinking straight.
01:36:19.542,01:36:21.041,You know what?
01:36:21.083,01:36:23.333,I am thinking straight.
01:36:23.375,01:36:26.500,"You can't, because you're a million fucking miles away."
01:36:26.542,01:36:28.166,"I'm here, Ed, every day."
01:36:28.208,01:36:35.417,"And I see the unnecessary travesties of this war that the rest of you backstabbing, political fucking bureaucrats only look at pictures of."
01:36:35.458,01:36:39.250,So don't you dare tell me I am not fucking thinking straight!
01:36:41.291,01:36:42.917,"This is not working, all right?"
01:36:42.959,01:36:44.709,It's not working. I'm out.
01:36:44.750,01:36:47.083,Ferris?
01:36:47.125,01:36:48.625,Ferris?
01:36:52.750,01:36:54.625,I should pack.
01:37:13.083,01:37:15.166,FERRIS: Fuck.
01:37:20.542,01:37:22.291,Fuck!
01:37:41.625,01:37:43.542,Shit!
01:37:43.583,01:37:45.875,Move the fucking car!
01:38:53.583,01:38:55.625,Where's Marwan?
01:38:55.667,01:38:57.041,Please.
01:38:58.083,01:38:59.542,"Please, please."
01:38:59.583,01:39:01.667,"I just need a moment of his time, all right?"
01:39:01.709,01:39:02.792,Okay.
01:39:05.583,01:39:06.792,Really?
01:39:09.083,01:39:10.750,Please?
01:39:12.291,01:39:14.500,Please excuse me.
01:39:21.166,01:39:23.250,What is it?
01:39:29.166,01:39:32.250,I invented Omar Sadiki.
01:39:32.291,01:39:33.417,It was my operation.
01:39:33.458,01:39:35.583,"He is not a jihadist, all right?"
01:39:35.625,01:39:40.000,"I moved him around, I moved money around, and then I lost him."
01:39:40.041,01:39:41.458,That is impossible.
01:39:41.500,01:39:43.125,Why?
01:39:43.166,01:39:46.875,Because it would mean that you sat in my office and you lied to my face.
01:39:46.917,01:39:50.875,"Hani, I promise I will share all the information with you, all right?"
01:39:50.917,01:39:54.250,But they have kidnapped a friend of mine in order to get to me.
01:39:54.291,01:39:56.709,"Now, you know exactly who I'm talking about, Hani."
01:39:56.750,01:40:00.417,"Please, they're gonna execute her, all right?"
01:40:00.458,01:40:02.834,"Please, help me broker a deal, her for me."
01:40:02.875,01:40:05.125,You lied to me.
01:40:05.166,01:40:06.208,I will not help you.
01:40:06.250,01:40:07.333,The answer is no.
01:40:07.375,01:40:09.083,"Please, Hani."
01:40:09.125,01:40:11.125,Hani. Hani!
01:40:30.250,01:40:32.041,Ed.
01:40:32.083,01:40:34.291,You should've told me you were getting serious about the girl buddy.
01:40:34.333,01:40:35.500,We could've watched her.
01:40:35.542,01:40:36.917,They left the phone.
01:40:36.959,01:40:38.959,"They've got Aisha, they want someone to take her place."
01:40:39.000,01:40:40.083,If she's alive.
01:40:40.125,01:40:43.041,"She has to be alive, right?"
01:40:43.083,01:40:45.333,"Well, she's probably alive."
01:40:45.375,01:40:46.875,"At least, they want you to think so."
01:40:46.917,01:40:47.750,That's the good part.
01:40:47.792,01:40:49.083,And what's the bad part?
01:40:49.125,01:40:50.667,They know about you.
01:40:50.709,01:40:53.125,They know you work for the agency.
01:40:53.166,01:40:54.500,That tells me two things.
01:40:54.542,01:40:58.291,"One, the people that have Aisha are running the show so they're close to Al-Saleem."
01:40:58.333,01:41:03.375,"Two, they have learned enough from Aisha to know that she's your pal, which means she's been interrogated."
01:41:03.417,01:41:04.792,Goddamn it.
01:41:03.417,01:41:06.417,"You cannot take this to Hani, right?"
01:41:06.458,01:41:08.250,"By right, does that mean you already have?"
01:41:08.291,01:41:10.291,Yes.
01:41:10.333,01:41:11.375,Why would you do that?
01:41:10.333,01:41:13.375,"Because, Ed, I have to trust everyone I can right now."
01:41:13.417,01:41:16.458,All you gotta do is trust me.
01:41:16.500,01:41:18.250,What'd he say?
01:41:18.291,01:41:20.166,"Because I lied to him, he's not gonna help."
01:41:23.041,01:41:24.041,Hey.
01:41:28.125,01:41:30.625,"Okay. We set this up, we're gonna do it right."
01:41:30.667,01:41:32.583,It is not just about you and your girlfriend.
01:41:32.625,01:41:34.166,All right.
01:41:34.542,01:41:37.458,U.S. EMBASSY - AMMAN FERRIS: This is Roger Ferris.
01:41:37.500,01:41:39.583,Will you put Aisha on the phone?
01:41:39.625,01:41:42.667,"Okay, mister. Thanks God you are calling."
01:41:42.709,01:41:46.417,I have a question to make sure you are you. Please.
01:41:46.458,01:41:47.667,Fine.
01:41:47.709,01:41:49.750,Where do you meet Miss Aisha first time?
01:41:49.792,01:41:52.333,FERRIS: At a medical clinic in Amman.
01:41:52.375,01:41:54.583,She's a nurse.
01:41:54.625,01:41:57.834,MAN: Where do you take Miss Aisha for dinner first time?
01:41:57.875,01:41:59.959,"Go, go."
01:42:00.000,01:42:03.083,Uh-- I didn't.
01:42:03.125,01:42:05.375,She invited me to her apartment for dinner.
01:42:05.417,01:42:07.291,MAN: Did you bring anything?
01:42:08.875,01:42:11.250,FERRIS: I did.
01:42:11.291,01:42:14.041,A dessert pastry.
01:42:14.083,01:42:17.458,"MAN: If you want to see Miss Aisha, you must go where I say."
01:42:17.500,01:42:19.458,Trade you for her.
01:42:19.500,01:42:22.125,No trick or Miss Aisha will die.
01:42:22.166,01:42:23.709,Tell me where I'm to go.
01:42:23.750,01:42:25.750,MAN: I'll tell you where to go.
01:42:25.792,01:42:27.667,It is near the border.
01:42:27.709,01:42:29.000,Highway 15.
01:42:29.041,01:42:31.333,Between Al-Saidi and Mahbrouk.
01:42:32.750,01:42:34.208,MAN: That's where you go. Bye.
01:42:52.709,01:43:12.000,BORDER CHECKPOINT - JORDAN/SYRIA Hold still... Don't make any noise back there.

01:45:31.375,01:45:46.542,"Holding at mid-altitude orbit, 12,500-- Still holding for vector angle."
01:45:57.417,01:45:59.041,Still holding for vector angle.
01:45:59.083,01:46:00.500,Switching over to SAR.
01:46:22.834,01:46:24.959,Which one do you want us to follow?
01:46:29.125,01:46:30.709,"Which one, sir?"
01:46:31.291,01:46:33.709,Sir?
01:46:33.750,01:46:35.875,"Sorry, buddy."
01:48:06.542,01:48:10.125,"Salaam, CIA."
01:48:10.375,01:48:12.875,"Salaamu alaykum, sheik."
01:48:12.917,01:48:14.834,I am not the sheik.
01:48:14.875,01:48:18.583,"The sheik, God praise him, is the sheik who always was."
01:48:18.625,01:48:20.583,I am his servant.
01:48:22.333,01:48:24.625,Where is the girl?
01:48:24.667,01:48:31.458,Either you're trying to be clever or someone has done to you what you so often do to them.
01:48:31.500,01:48:32.542,Lie.
01:48:34.208,01:48:36.542,"So you paid for me, hmm?"
01:48:36.583,01:48:38.375,AL-SALEEM: Not as much as I would have.
01:48:38.417,01:48:42.291,Such a bargain for such a catch as you.
01:48:42.333,01:48:46.792,"FERRIS: Well, it wasn't a bargain, because no one's gonna negotiate with you for me."
01:48:46.834,01:48:49.291,That's not our policy.
01:48:49.333,01:48:51.083,"You understand that, right?"
01:48:51.125,01:48:54.750,"There will be no negotiation, but not because you say so."
01:48:54.792,01:48:58.166,I have an agent of the CIA.
01:48:58.208,01:49:01.792,And that's what I came to see.
01:49:01.834,01:49:03.375,And that's what matters.
01:49:03.834,01:49:10.417,In this world there's enough poverty and frustration and anger and passion.
01:49:10.458,01:49:14.208,There will never be a shortage of martyrs.
01:49:14.250,01:49:15.750,"Just like these men, huh?"
01:49:15.792,01:49:18.542,These men who are dispensable to you.
01:49:18.583,01:49:24.000,"These men who-- Who blow themselves up in the name of Allah, who kill their own brothers and sisters, huh?"
01:49:24.041,01:49:28.208,There is no place in the Koran for the murder of innocent people and suicide.
01:49:28.250,01:49:29.333,You know that.
01:49:29.375,01:49:30.500,AL-SALEEM: It's a good try.
01:49:30.542,01:49:35.542,"But the Koran's sayings-- You speak Arabic, no?"
01:49:35.583,01:49:42.125,Do not say that those slain in the cause of God are dead.
01:49:42.166,01:49:43.583,They are alive...
01:49:43.625,01:49:46.375,...but you are not aware of them.
01:49:46.417,01:49:50.291,"So you misinterpret the one book you believe in, hmm?"
01:49:50.333,01:49:59.041,"But are you pure, or are you just as corrupt as the-- As the capitalist Westerners that you despise? To me, you are fucking slaves."
01:49:59.083,01:50:03.250,You're slaves to the Saudi oil sheiks and the Wahabi oil money that funds you.
01:50:03.291,01:50:09.917,"And when that oil money runs out, my friends, you will all fucking disappear into the ashes of history."
01:50:09.959,01:50:13.291,"I am not going to torture you, Mr. Ferris."
01:50:13.333,01:50:17.625,I see you're not going to read what is prepared for you on paper.
01:50:17.667,01:50:18.875,It's all right.
01:50:18.917,01:50:23.417,"All I need from you, I already have."
01:50:23.458,01:50:26.333,You know what that camera is for?
01:50:26.375,01:50:27.542,It's not for this.
01:50:27.583,01:50:30.291,This-- This is intermission.
01:50:30.333,01:50:34.417,It's for what comes after this.
01:50:34.458,01:50:36.750,For what comes now.
01:50:37.709,01:50:38.834,Turn on the camera.
01:50:46.208,01:50:47.667,Kareem.
01:50:48.959,01:50:50.583,FERRIS: But you paid who for me?
01:50:50.625,01:50:53.291,An intermediary who works for who?
01:50:53.333,01:50:56.291,You don't know who and that should concern you.
01:50:56.333,01:50:57.792,Do I look concerned?
01:50:57.834,01:50:59.917,"FERRIS: Well, that's what surprises me."
01:50:59.959,01:51:01.875,I thought you were a lot smarter than that.
01:51:01.917,01:51:06.083,Someone has betrayed you.
01:51:06.125,01:51:13.542,He works for the head of Jordanian Intelligence which means he works for us which means-- Heh-heh.
01:51:11.917,01:51:17.208,Which means-- Which means you work for us.
01:51:19.166,01:51:21.125,I work for you.
01:51:24.458,01:51:25.417,...CIA.
01:51:33.291,01:51:34.500,Are you comfortable?
01:51:34.542,01:51:40.250,Can I make you more comfortable?
01:51:45.625,01:51:47.083,"I'm not lying to you, Kareem."
01:51:47.125,01:51:48.583,I'm not lying to you.
01:51:49.959,01:51:52.500,We know-- We know where you are!
01:51:54.458,01:51:56.625,AL-SALEEM: Where am I?
01:51:56.667,01:51:59.792,You-- You-- You are in the light.
01:51:59.834,01:52:01.625,The light is on you.
01:52:01.667,01:52:02.959,Look at it.
01:52:03.875,01:52:05.750,"FERRIS: No, no, no."
01:52:05.792,01:52:09.792,"The light-- The light is on you, motherfucker."
01:52:14.583,01:52:17.291,"What do you think is happening here, Mr. Ferris?"
01:52:17.333,01:52:20.208,Do you think the cavalry is coming for you?
01:52:21.083,01:52:22.917,Let's wait.
01:52:24.917,01:52:27.709,AL-SALEEM: Nobody's coming for you.
01:52:27.750,01:52:30.000,Welcome to Guantanamo.
01:52:32.792,01:52:33.875,God!
01:52:33.917,01:52:35.250,Fuck!
01:53:17.792,01:53:18.834,Cut him loose.
01:53:41.000,01:53:43.125,Turn him.
01:53:58.542,01:54:01.834,"In the name of God, the gracious, the merciful."
01:54:01.875,01:54:06.125,Fight the infidels They have no beliefs.
01:54:06.166,01:54:10.000,This is the punishment for the non-believer.
01:54:10.041,01:54:14.375,I would advise you to pray.
01:54:14.417,01:54:16.417,There is no need to resist.
01:54:16.458,01:54:19.375,The time has come.
01:54:22.834,01:54:25.458,-God is great.
01:55:02.875,01:55:04.208,Put the cigarette out.
01:55:04.250,01:55:06.834,Of course. Hello.
01:55:06.875,01:55:09.750,I'm Marwan Se-Keia.
01:55:09.792,01:55:12.667,Security officer for Hani Salaam.
01:55:12.709,01:55:14.542,You're under arrest.
01:55:27.959,01:55:33.959,"HANI: You know, you can always tell who cares about you the most by who comes first to visit you in the hospital."
01:55:34.000,01:55:36.208,And I believe I am the first.
01:55:36.250,01:55:39.208,"Although that is not difficult, because nobody knows where you are."
01:55:39.250,01:55:41.000,Yeah.
01:55:41.041,01:55:43.166,"And where am I, Hani?"
01:55:43.208,01:55:45.667,"HANI: You're home, in Amman."
01:55:47.834,01:55:59.500,"So it was your man I spoke to on the phone, your men who-- Who took Aisha, your men who dropped me off in the desert."
01:55:59.542,01:56:02.709,"HANI: I was of some assistance, I admit."
01:56:02.750,01:56:06.709,"But, uh, it was not me that picked you up in the desert."
01:56:06.750,01:56:08.542,Edward could not find you.
01:56:08.583,01:56:15.417,"Not with all his aircraft, all his people, all his money and joie de vivre."
01:56:15.458,01:56:17.917,"So how, I wonder, did I do it?"
01:56:17.959,01:56:19.166,Karami.
01:56:19.208,01:56:21.458,Very good.
01:56:21.500,01:56:23.500,"Yes, I remember him, Hani."
01:56:23.542,01:56:26.041,He was in the fucking room with me.
01:56:26.083,01:56:30.000,He was in the room because I put him there.
01:56:30.041,01:56:32.709,I'm just sorry I wasn't there a few minutes sooner.
01:56:32.750,01:56:34.417,Right.
01:56:32.750,01:56:36.417,"What would've happened if you were a few minutes later, Hani?"
01:56:36.458,01:56:37.917,Then I shudder to think.
01:56:37.959,01:56:39.333,"No, I shudder to think."
01:56:41.041,01:56:44.542,"How badly did you hurt Aisha when you took her, huh?"
01:56:44.583,01:56:45.625,That's what I wanna know.
01:56:45.667,01:56:47.417,"Aisha, not at all."
01:56:48.709,01:56:51.041,The room we messed up after we took her.
01:56:51.083,01:56:52.959,"Bullshit, Hani, bullshit!"
01:56:51.083,01:56:55.125,Hey-- Hey-- All right. We tested that blood!
01:56:55.166,01:56:56.291,It was hers!
01:56:56.333,01:56:57.625,She is a nurse.
01:56:57.667,01:56:59.250,She gives blood every month.
01:56:59.291,01:57:01.834,"Now, please, let go of the jacket. Thank you."
01:57:03.125,01:57:07.166,"You're-- You're trying to tell me you-- You didn't tell her, Hani?"
01:57:07.208,01:57:13.000,"I told her what I could, which I admit was not very much, because these are matters of state security."
01:57:13.041,01:57:15.667,So she doesn't know anything about what happened?
01:57:15.709,01:57:18.792,She knows what everybody who knows me knows.
01:57:18.834,01:57:23.041,That I am an exceedingly polite gentleman and a very good conversationalist.
01:57:25.375,01:57:31.333,"If I may be so fucking impolite, Hani, I almost died in that goddamn room."
01:57:31.375,01:57:34.959,"And if you had died, I would have told her what you did for her."
01:57:35.000,01:57:39.875,And she-- She would have loved you forever.
01:57:39.917,01:57:43.583,Whereas now you are going to have to earn that right.
01:57:43.625,01:57:47.083,That's-- That's great news.
01:57:49.166,01:57:51.291,"Fantastic work, Hani."
01:57:51.333,01:57:53.125,Really. Excellent.
01:57:54.125,01:57:56.583,"So you now have Al-Saleem, right?"
01:57:56.625,01:57:59.500,"That was the plan, my dear."
01:58:00.959,01:58:05.000,And I presume he's not giving you any information.
01:58:05.041,01:58:06.750,Not yet.
01:58:18.375,01:58:20.709,"HOFFMAN: Your work's done here, buddy."
01:58:20.750,01:58:22.458,You're gonna come back with me.
01:58:22.500,01:58:25.834,I got you a corner office just down the hall from mine.
01:58:25.875,01:58:29.417,"As soon as I get the guy who's in it out of it, it's all yours."
01:58:29.458,01:58:31.709,"More money, a fancy title."
01:58:31.750,01:58:34.709,"No sunscreen, no couscous, unless you really want it."
01:58:34.750,01:58:37.000,"Hmm. Right down the hall from you, huh, Ed?"
01:58:37.041,01:58:39.125,Right down the hall from me.
01:58:39.166,01:58:42.917,"Well, I think we both know you'd be more comfortable without me there."
01:58:44.041,01:58:47.583,"Now, don't think about it too long, because I'll take that as a slight."
01:58:47.625,01:58:49.000,Hmm.
01:58:49.041,01:58:52.250,"Besides, what else are you gonna do?"
01:58:52.291,01:58:53.583,Stay here?
01:58:53.625,01:58:55.750,"Well, maybe for a little while, huh?"
01:58:55.792,01:58:57.250,"I mean, why wouldn't I?"
01:58:57.291,01:58:59.166,Why would you?
01:58:59.208,01:59:01.750,What if I like the Middle East?
01:59:03.250,01:59:05.417,"Ain't nobody likes the Middle East, buddy."
01:59:05.458,01:59:06.750,There's nothing here to like.
01:59:06.792,01:59:08.792,Hmm.
01:59:08.834,01:59:13.583,"Well, maybe that's the problem right there, isn't it, Ed?"
01:59:13.625,01:59:15.625,Hmm.
01:59:15.667,01:59:17.792,"Oh, buddy, buddy, buddy."
01:59:17.834,01:59:22.041,"You know, you're the best I got."
01:59:22.083,01:59:24.125,And you know it hurts me to say that.
01:59:26.875,01:59:29.959,"Good luck on winning this war, Ed."
01:59:30.000,01:59:34.083,"I hope everyone thinks you did it all by yourself, huh?"
01:59:39.125,01:59:41.125,You're not safe here.
01:59:41.166,01:59:43.083,I'm not safe anywhere.
01:59:43.125,01:59:45.417,"You walk out on me, you know what that means."
01:59:45.458,01:59:48.250,What does that mean?
01:59:48.291,01:59:50.417,That means you're giving up on America.
01:59:50.458,01:59:55.375,"Just be careful calling yourself America, huh, Ed?"
01:59:55.417,01:59:57.834,"Listen, you have a safe flight home."
01:59:57.875,02:00:00.250,Say hey to the wife and kids.
02:00:00.291,02:00:03.041,"Nobody's innocent in this shit, Ferris."
02:01:22.333,02:01:24.000,What's he doing?
02:01:24.041,02:01:26.125,MAN: Nothing. Buying vegetables.
02:01:26.959,02:01:28.250,"What about us, sir?"
02:01:28.291,02:01:29.917,What do you want us to do?
02:01:29.959,02:01:31.125,Are we staying with him?
02:01:31.166,02:01:32.875,No.
02:01:32.917,02:01:34.875,Buddy's done.
02:01:34.917,02:01:36.458,He's all by himself.
02:01:36.500,02:01:40.375,MAN: Copy that. Cleared off target.
