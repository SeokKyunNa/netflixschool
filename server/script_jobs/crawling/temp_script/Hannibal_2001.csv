00:00:42.083,00:00:48.458,"about the science courses I was takin' and-- Some kind of mail-order courses in psychology, Nurse Barney?"
00:00:48.500,00:00:53.083,"No, sir. See, I don't consider psychology a science."
00:00:53.125,00:00:55.375,And neither did Dr. Lecter.
00:00:58.625,00:01:08.417,"Barney, while you were working at the asylum, you observed Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter..."
00:01:08.458,00:01:10.667,"Uh, interacting?"
00:01:10.709,00:01:13.417,Talking to one another.
00:01:13.458,00:01:25.417,"Yes, uh-- Yes, it seemed to me that they-- I can see you're eager to justify your consulting fee, but why don't we start with what you saw, not what you thought about what you saw."
00:01:25.458,00:01:29.792,"Cordell, don't be like that."
00:01:29.834,00:01:34.291,"Barney, give us your opinion of what you saw."
00:01:34.333,00:01:35.959,What was it between them?
00:01:37.417,00:01:42.166,"Well, most of the time, uh, Dr. Lecter didn't respond at all to visitors."
00:01:42.208,00:01:45.083,"Uh, he'd just, for instance, open his eyes long enough..."
00:01:45.125,00:01:48.250,to insult some academic who was there to look over him.
00:01:49.875,00:01:52.083,"With Starling, he answered her questions."
00:01:52.125,00:01:54.083,She interested him.
00:01:54.083,00:01:56.333,"Uh, she intrigued him."
00:01:56.375,00:01:59.875,He thought she was charming and amusing.
00:01:59.917,00:02:04.792,"So, Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter became..."
00:02:04.834,00:02:06.750,friendly.
00:02:06.792,00:02:10.667,"Well, inside a kind of formal structure, yes."
00:02:10.709,00:02:14.083,And he was...
00:02:16.500,00:02:19.917,Yes.
00:02:19.959,00:02:22.083,Thank you very much for your candor.
00:02:22.125,00:02:25.250,And keep all those wonderful items...
00:02:25.291,00:02:27.542,from your personal Lecter treasure trove coming.
00:02:27.583,00:02:31.875,I've enjoyed them immensely.
00:02:31.917,00:02:34.500,"Oh, I almost forgot."
00:02:34.542,00:02:37.542,I might be able to get a cookie down.
00:02:37.583,00:02:40.083,I think it would kill you.
00:02:48.542,00:02:51.375,How much?
00:02:51.417,00:02:54.834,Thousand.
00:02:51.417,00:02:59.125,"Cordell, cut a check for $250,000."
00:04:53.208,00:04:55.333,How can she sleep at a time like this?
00:04:57.208,00:05:00.083,She's on a jump-out squad all night.
00:05:20.667,00:05:22.333,Stay in that spot.
00:05:30.250,00:05:33.291,We got some guy named Bolton from the D.C. Police.
00:05:34.583,00:05:37.917,"All right, everyone, pay attention."
00:05:37.959,00:05:40.291,Excuse me.
00:05:40.333,00:05:42.834,"Yes, I can see that from your badge."
00:05:42.875,00:05:45.083,I'm in charge here.
00:05:45.125,00:05:51.333,"Officer Bolton, I'm Special Agent Starling, and just so we don't get off on the wrong foot, let me explain why we're all here."
00:05:51.375,00:05:53.375,I'm here because I know Evelda Drumgo.
00:05:53.417,00:05:55.417,I've arrested her twice on RICO warrants.
00:05:55.458,00:06:00.333,"D.E.A. and A.T.F., in addition to backing me up, are here for the drugs and the weapons."
00:06:00.375,00:06:09.458,"You're here because our mayor wants to appear tough on drugs, especially after his own cocaine conviction, and he hopes he can accomplish that by having you join us here today."
00:06:09.500,00:06:10.959,"You got a smart mouth, lady."
00:06:11.083,00:06:15.083,"Officer, if you wouldn't mind, I'd appreciate it if you'd let me continue."
00:06:16.208,00:06:18.917,"All right, take a look."
00:06:18.959,00:06:21.417,Back's on the water.
00:06:21.458,00:06:23.834,"Across the street, ground floor, is the meth lab."
00:06:23.875,00:06:29.625,"Evelda Drumgo's H.I.V. positive, and she will spit and bite if she's cornered, so you should watch it."
00:06:29.667,00:06:31.458,And if you happen to be the one...
00:06:31.500,00:06:36.083,"who puts her in a patrol car in front of the news cameras, Officer Bolton, you don't want to push her head down."
00:06:36.125,00:06:38.875,She'll likely have a needle in her hair.
00:06:38.917,00:06:41.125,"inside the building, not out in the street."
00:06:41.166,00:06:43.208,We can get closest with the van.
00:06:43.250,00:06:48.417,"If it looks good, on my signal we hit the front, D.E.A. hits the back, D.C.P.D. backin' them up."
00:06:48.458,00:06:50.750,She'll have her watchers out at least three blocks around.
00:06:50.792,00:06:55.250,"They've tipped her before in time, so let's not make spectacles of ourselves."
00:07:06.625,00:07:09.792,Pretty busy today.
00:07:15.792,00:07:18.333,Can I please get a cup of coffee?
00:07:35.083,00:07:37.333,- Did you see that?
00:07:45.667,00:07:47.458,"Hey, what's up, man?"
00:07:57.458,00:07:59.875,"Goddamn it, it's her, with three guys."
00:08:00.083,00:08:04.208,They're all packin'.
00:08:04.250,00:08:07.750,"Hey, Brigham, it's too crowded."
00:08:07.792,00:08:11.250,There are too many people.
00:08:11.291,00:08:13.500,I agree.
00:08:13.542,00:08:15.917,"All units, stand down."
00:08:15.959,00:08:18.125,- Whiskey team copies.
00:08:18.166,00:08:20.166,This is Bolton.
00:08:20.208,00:08:22.834,"I said all units stand down, Bolton. Right now."
00:08:22.875,00:08:25.166,It's too late.
00:08:25.208,00:08:28.083,Stand down now.
00:08:28.083,00:08:31.583,"I repeat, she's carrying a baby."
00:08:31.625,00:08:33.667,"Keep that gun down, Bolton."
00:08:33.709,00:08:36.083,- Light his ass up.
00:08:36.125,00:08:38.083,Down on the ground!
00:09:19.291,00:09:23.250,Hold it!
00:09:25.125,00:09:28.333,- Don't!
00:09:29.375,00:09:32.125,"Evelda, get out of the car!"
00:09:33.583,00:09:35.500,"Starling, is that you?"
00:09:37.750,00:09:39.750,Step away from the car!
00:09:39.792,00:09:43.458,"- Show me your hands, Evelda."
00:09:45.166,00:09:48.417,Please.
00:09:48.458,00:09:50.083,How've you been?
00:09:50.083,00:09:53.083,- Don't do this.
00:10:25.250,00:10:27.458,It's all right.
00:10:27.500,00:10:31.458,"I know, I know."
00:10:33.083,00:10:35.375,It's okay.
00:10:36.500,00:10:38.375,It's okay.
00:10:57.291,00:10:59.542,"Friends, family and coworkers gathered here this morning..."
00:10:59.583,00:11:01.583,at Arlington National Cemetery...
00:11:01.625,00:11:05.500,"to bury B.A.T.F. Agent John Brigham, shot and killed in the line of duty Friday."
00:11:05.542,00:11:07.375,He was 40 years old.
00:11:07.417,00:11:10.792,This ill-fated drug raid that claimed his life and five others...
00:11:10.834,00:11:17.750,"is the latest in a seemingly endless series of incidents, beginning with Waco, Texas, in which the Justice Department and the F.B.I..."
00:11:17.792,00:11:21.792,have been questioned about their use of firepower rather than judgment.
00:11:21.834,00:11:24.417,This time it was F.B.I.
00:11:24.458,00:11:26.125,heading up the calamitous strike force.
00:11:26.166,00:11:29.917,Agent Starling attained some measure of celebrity 10 years ago...
00:11:29.959,00:11:38.083,"when she was given information by Dr. Hannibal The Cannibal Lecter, which led to the rescue of Catherine Martin, daughter of the former U.S. Senator from Tennessee."
00:11:38.083,00:11:42.083,"However, when she returns to work later this week, she won't be so celebrated."
00:11:42.083,00:11:51.125,"Attorney Telford Higgins, representing one of the families of those slain, says he will file a wrongful death suit-- Cordell!"
00:12:00.083,00:12:01.750,Cordell!
00:12:03.083,00:12:05.792,"Yes, sir."
00:12:13.750,00:12:16.834,"Agent Starling, this is John Eldridge from D.E.A."
00:12:16.875,00:12:19.417,"Assistant Director Noonan, of course, you know."
00:12:19.458,00:12:22.583,"Larkin Wayne, from our Office of Professional Responsibility."
00:12:22.625,00:12:24.583,"Bob Sneed, A.T.F."
00:12:24.625,00:12:27.750,"Benny Holcombe, assistant to the mayor."
00:12:27.792,00:12:32.792,You know Paul.
00:12:32.834,00:12:35.458,"In other words, he's here and he's not here."
00:12:37.792,00:12:41.500,So I take it you've seen the coverage in the papers and on television.
00:12:41.542,00:12:44.208,"I have nothing to do with the news, Mr. Krendler."
00:12:44.250,00:12:47.166,The woman had a baby in her arms.
00:12:47.208,00:12:50.291,There are pictures.
00:12:50.333,00:12:53.625,Not in her arms.
00:12:53.667,00:12:55.792,In her arms she had a MAC-10.
00:12:55.834,00:12:58.959,"Look, we're here to help you, Starling."
00:12:59.083,00:13:02.083,It's gonna be a hell of a lot harder to do with a combative attitude.
00:13:07.291,00:13:09.583,"Can I speak freely, Mr. Pearsall?"
00:13:11.291,00:13:14.375,Your agency called this office to get me assigned to help you on this raid.
00:13:14.417,00:13:16.500,I tried to do that.
00:13:16.542,00:13:22.667,"I clearly expressed my judgment and was ignored, and now a good agent and a friend is dead."
00:13:25.834,00:13:28.667,"You shot and killed five people out there, Agent Starling."
00:13:28.709,00:13:30.709,Is that how you define good judgment?
00:13:30.750,00:13:33.834,This raid was an ugly mess.
00:13:33.875,00:13:37.125,I ended up in a position where I had a choice of dying...
00:13:37.166,00:13:39.208,or shooting a woman carrying a child.
00:13:40.083,00:13:41.625,I chose.
00:13:41.667,00:13:43.250,I shot her.
00:13:44.250,00:13:46.667,I killed a mother holding her child.
00:13:48.709,00:13:51.125,And I regret it.
00:13:51.166,00:13:53.834,"Gentleman, I'm going to call a halt to this meeting..."
00:13:53.875,00:13:56.333,and get back to you individually by phone.
00:14:00.542,00:14:02.625,That was a waste of time.
00:14:04.583,00:14:06.792,"You have a secret admirer, Starling."
00:14:06.834,00:14:11.542,"He isn't much to look at, but he does have friends in high places."
00:14:11.583,00:14:13.250,Remember Mason Verger?
00:14:14.500,00:14:17.083,Lecter's fourth victim.
00:14:17.083,00:14:18.500,The rich one.
00:14:18.542,00:14:20.583,The only one that survived.
00:14:22.250,00:14:24.917,He says he has some new information on Lecter.
00:14:24.959,00:14:28.667,"What do you mean, only share it with me?"
00:14:28.709,00:14:31.875,We'd rather not.
00:14:31.917,00:14:34.458,"When I speak to you, you'll know it, because I'll look at you."
00:14:36.166,00:14:37.709,Why would we rather not?
00:14:37.750,00:14:39.542,The last time he called was...
00:14:39.583,00:14:41.417,when we took Lecter off the Ten Most Wanted list.
00:14:42.667,00:14:45.083,He was upset about that.
00:14:45.083,00:14:50.083,"He said, Hey, this is a Senate Oversight Committee..."
00:14:50.083,00:14:57.083,"His family's political contributions may not be enough to, uh, buy a senator, but they are enough to rent them from time to time."
00:14:57.125,00:15:00.875,There's no reason to go through that again if he really does have something new.
00:15:03.583,00:15:06.083,"It's a good deal for you, Starling."
00:15:06.083,00:15:07.583,You can't pretend it isn't.
00:15:07.625,00:15:10.917,You get to go back on a celebrated case.
00:15:10.959,00:15:14.291,I'll take care of the media for your Drumgo killing.
00:15:14.333,00:15:15.917,Everyone's gonna be happy.
00:15:15.959,00:15:17.667,I'm not happy.
00:15:19.083,00:15:22.333,"Well, maybe you're incapable of being happy."
00:15:22.375,00:15:23.875,Mr. Krendler.
00:15:25.125,00:15:28.959,"When you're out on the street, you know you might take a bullet in the line of duty."
00:15:29.083,00:15:33.250,"You accept it, or you get out."
00:15:33.291,00:15:38.458,"What you don't expect, or accept, is taking one in the back in your boss's office..."
00:15:38.500,00:15:40.625,for doing your job exactly as they've taught you.
00:15:40.667,00:15:42.625,That makes you unhappy.
00:15:42.667,00:15:45.083,"Of course you're right, Starling."
00:15:46.333,00:15:48.291,But it doesn't really change anything.
00:15:48.333,00:15:50.083,It changes everything.
00:16:42.375,00:16:45.750,"Miss Starling, hi."
00:16:45.792,00:16:48.709,How do you do?
00:16:55.250,00:16:59.083,One's eyes adjust to the darkness.
00:17:14.083,00:17:17.500,"Mr. Verger, Agent Starling is here."
00:17:17.542,00:17:19.125,"Good morning, Mr. Verger."
00:17:20.625,00:17:23.959,Was that a Mustang I heard out there?
00:17:24.083,00:17:27.417,Five-liter?
00:17:27.458,00:17:29.083,Fast.
00:17:30.083,00:17:32.709,"Cordell, I think you can leave us now."
00:17:32.750,00:17:37.500,"I, uh, thought I might stay."
00:17:37.542,00:17:41.458,You could be useful seeing about my lunch.
00:17:45.333,00:17:51.750,"I'd like to attach this microphone to your clothing or your pillow, if you're comfortable with that."
00:17:56.875,00:17:58.834,"Here, this should make it easier."
00:18:06.709,00:18:10.959,"You know, I thank God for what happened."
00:18:11.083,00:18:13.166,It was my salvation.
00:18:14.625,00:18:17.875,"Have you accepted Jesus, Agent Starling?"
00:18:17.917,00:18:20.625,Do you have faith?
00:18:20.667,00:18:23.583,That's not what I asked.
00:18:23.625,00:18:29.709,"This is Special Agent Clarice Starling, 5143690, deposing Mason R. Verger on March 20, sworn and attested."
00:18:29.750,00:18:31.583,I wanna tell you about summer camp.
00:18:29.750,00:18:34.291,Mr. Verger-- - It was a wonderful childhood experience.
00:18:34.333,00:18:38.750,We can get to it now.
00:18:38.792,00:18:43.291,It was a Christian camp my father founded...
00:18:43.333,00:18:47.917,"for poor, unfortunate, cast-off little boys and girls..."
00:18:47.959,00:18:50.959,who would do anything for a candy bar.
00:18:51.083,00:18:53.083,"Mr. Verger, I don't need to know about the sex offenses."
00:18:53.083,00:18:55.083,"I just have to-- Oh, it's all right."
00:18:55.083,00:18:57.875,I have immunity from the U.S. Attorneys.
00:18:57.917,00:19:02.500,And I have immunity from the risen Jesus.
00:19:02.542,00:19:04.834,And nobody beats the Riz.
00:19:04.875,00:19:06.333,Had you ever seen Dr. Lecter...
00:19:06.375,00:19:09.208,before the court assigned you to him for therapy?
00:19:09.250,00:19:12.458,What do you mean?
00:19:12.500,00:19:16.875,"That is what I mean, yes, if you don't mind talking about it."
00:19:16.917,00:19:19.166,"Oh, no, not at all."
00:19:19.208,00:19:24.458,I didn't say you should be.
00:19:24.500,00:19:26.417,How did he end up at your house?
00:19:26.458,00:19:33.166,"I invited him, of course, to my pied-à-terre."
00:19:33.208,00:19:37.458,I came to the door in my nicest come-hither outfit.
00:19:37.500,00:19:39.542,I was concerned...
00:19:39.583,00:19:42.917,that he'd be afraid of me.
00:19:42.959,00:19:46.291,But he didn't seem to be.
00:19:47.500,00:19:49.709,That's almost funny now.
00:19:49.750,00:19:56.125,"I showed him my toys, my noose setup, among other things."
00:19:56.166,00:20:00.542,"It's where you sort of hang yourself, but not really."
00:20:00.583,00:20:04.542,"It feels good while you are, well, you know."
00:20:04.583,00:20:11.625,"Anyway, - he said, Mason-- - Mason, would you like a popper?"
00:20:11.667,00:20:15.959,"And I said, Would I? Oh, wow!"
00:20:16.000,00:20:18.834,"Once that kicked in, I was flying."
00:20:18.875,00:20:22.792,"He said, Mason, show me how you smile..."
00:20:22.834,00:20:26.458,to gain the confidence of a child.
00:20:26.500,00:20:32.458,"When I smiled, he said, Oh, I see how you do it."
00:20:32.500,00:20:37.333,The good doctor approached me with a piece of broken mirror.
00:20:37.375,00:20:39.542,Try this.
00:20:39.583,00:20:45.000,Try peeling off your face-- And feeding it to the dogs.
00:20:53.625,00:20:58.375,"No, I can still see it."
00:20:58.417,00:21:00.667,"No, I'm afraid not."
00:21:07.125,00:21:11.709,"Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time."
00:21:07.125,00:21:15.750,"Mr. Verger, you indicated to me that you'd received some kind of new information."
00:21:16.667,00:21:19.208,"Uh, Cordell!"
00:21:33.917,00:21:36.291,Where did this come from?
00:21:36.333,00:21:39.667,Buenos Aires.
00:21:41.500,00:21:44.125,Where's the package it came in?
00:21:44.166,00:21:47.542,Good question.
00:21:47.583,00:21:49.417,"Cordell, did-- did we throw it out?"
00:21:50.709,00:21:53.834,"Yes, I'm afraid we did."
00:21:53.875,00:21:57.750,You think it'll help?
00:21:57.792,00:21:59.834,I hope it'll help you catch him...
00:21:59.875,00:22:03.125,to help cleanse the stigma of your recent dishonor.
00:22:03.166,00:22:06.166,Thank you.
00:22:06.208,00:22:10.083,Did you find some rapport with Dr. Lecter...
00:22:10.083,00:22:13.125,in your talks at the asylum?
00:22:13.166,00:22:16.166,I know I did while I was peeling.
00:22:16.208,00:22:19.667,We exchanged information in a civil way.
00:22:19.709,00:22:21.542,But always through the glass.
00:22:21.583,00:22:23.375,Yes.
00:22:31.291,00:22:35.250,Isn't it funny?
00:22:35.291,00:22:37.750,What's that?
00:22:37.792,00:22:45.083,"You can look at my face, but you shied when I said the name of God."
00:23:10.792,00:23:12.417,Finding what you want?
00:23:12.458,00:23:15.792,Are you sure this is all of it?
00:23:15.834,00:23:19.792,"There was more, but it's been picked over little by little over the years."
00:23:21.250,00:23:24.834,"You know, this stuff's worth a lot of money in certain circles."
00:23:26.542,00:23:30.166,"It's kinda like the cocaine that disappears around here, little by little."
00:23:59.166,00:24:01.166,Move his head out of there!
00:24:54.875,00:24:57.875,"Hey, Barney."
00:24:59.083,00:25:03.291,"Would you agree for the record, Agent Starling, I've not been read my rights?"
00:25:07.750,00:25:12.291,I have not Mirandized Barney.
00:25:14.208,00:25:20.542,"So, when you turned Dr. Lecter over to the Tennessee police-- They weren't civil to him."
00:25:20.583,00:25:23.208,"Yeah, they only survived his company three days."
00:25:23.250,00:25:26.208,You survived him six years at the asylum.
00:25:26.250,00:25:29.291,How'd you do that?
00:25:29.333,00:25:31.959,"Yes, it was."
00:25:32.083,00:25:35.417,"Did you ever think, after he escaped, he might come after you?"
00:25:35.458,00:25:41.166,"He once told me that, whenever feasible, he preferred to eat the rude."
00:25:41.208,00:25:45.375,"Free-range rude, he called 'em."
00:25:45.417,00:25:48.625,You ever think he might come after you?
00:25:48.667,00:25:52.291,"Oh, at least 30 seconds of every day."
00:25:52.333,00:25:56.208,"He's always with me, like a bad habit."
00:25:56.250,00:26:00.917,Do you-- Do you know what happened to his stuff?
00:26:00.959,00:26:05.333,Everything got thrown away when the place closed.
00:26:05.375,00:26:08.959,"Barney, I just found out that Dr. Lecter's signed copy of The Joy of Cooking..."
00:26:09.083,00:26:12.291,"sold to a private collector for $16,000."
00:26:12.333,00:26:15.709,Whew!
00:26:15.750,00:26:20.083,The seller's affidavit of ownership was signed Karen Phlox.
00:26:20.083,00:26:23.291,Do you know Karen Phlox?
00:26:23.333,00:26:27.125,"She filled out your employment application, only at the bottom, she signed it Barney."
00:26:28.083,00:26:30.083,The same thing on your tax returns.
00:26:33.291,00:26:37.125,You want the book?
00:26:37.166,00:26:41.875,I want the X-ray they shot after you broke Lecter's arm during the attack on that nurse.
00:26:41.917,00:26:43.750,And everything else you got.
00:26:48.166,00:26:51.959,"We, uh, used to talk about a lot of things at night..."
00:26:52.083,00:26:55.083,after the screamin' finally died down.
00:26:58.375,00:27:02.625,We talked about you sometimes.
00:27:02.667,00:27:05.083,Go get the X-ray.
00:27:11.083,00:27:14.667,I'm not a bad guy.
00:27:14.709,00:27:16.625,Dr. Chilton was a bad guy.
00:27:16.667,00:27:22.458,"After your first visit, he started taping your conversations with Dr. Lecter."
00:27:24.125,00:27:27.166,These... are valuable.
00:27:32.375,00:27:36.375,Go on now.
00:27:39.959,00:27:42.959,And what'd he say?
00:27:43.083,00:27:45.083,What'd he say about me late at night?
00:27:46.500,00:27:49.333,"Well, he was talkin' about inherited, hardwired behavior."
00:27:49.375,00:27:52.208,He was using genetics in the roller pigeons as an example.
00:27:52.250,00:27:57.083,"They fly way up in the air, roll over backwards in a display, fallin' toward the ground."
00:27:57.083,00:28:00.500,"There are shallow rollers, and there are deep rollers."
00:28:00.542,00:28:08.417,"You can't breed two deep rollers, or their young, their offspring will roll all the way down, hit and die."
00:28:08.458,00:28:11.458,"Agent Starling is a deep roller, Barney."
00:28:11.500,00:28:15.083,Let us hope one of her parents was not.
00:28:15.083,00:28:20.083,"Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice."
00:28:20.125,00:28:26.125,"Jack Crawford dangles you in front of me, then I give you a bit of help."
00:28:26.166,00:28:28.375,Do you think it's because I like to look at you...
00:28:28.417,00:28:33.625,"and imagine how good you would taste, Clarice?"
00:28:34.750,00:28:37.291,I don't know. Is it?
00:28:39.542,00:28:47.083,"I've been in this room for eight years now, Clarice, and I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive."
00:28:47.125,00:28:49.417,What I want is a view.
00:28:49.458,00:28:53.750,I want a window where I can see a tree...
00:28:53.792,00:28:57.083,to be in a federal institution far away from Dr. Chilton.
00:29:09.875,00:29:13.333,The Capponi correspondence goes back to the 13th century.
00:29:13.375,00:29:20.959,"Dr. Fell might hold in his hand, his non-Italian hand, a note from Dante Alighieri himself."
00:29:21.083,00:29:23.750,But would he recognize it?
00:29:25.083,00:29:33.709,"Gentlemen, you have examined him in medieval Italian, and I will not deny that his language is admirable for a straniero."
00:29:33.750,00:29:38.625,But is he acquainted with the personalities of the pre-Renaissance Firenze?
00:29:38.667,00:29:41.458,I think not.
00:29:41.500,00:29:46.834,"What if he came upon a note in the Capponi library, say, from Guido de' Cavalcanti?"
00:29:46.875,00:29:50.834,Would he recognize that?
00:29:50.875,00:29:52.917,They're still arguing?
00:29:56.333,00:29:58.959,Sogliato wants the job for his nephew.
00:29:59.083,00:30:03.333,But the scholars seem satisfied with the temporary guy they appointed.
00:30:03.375,00:30:08.667,"If he's such an expert on Dante, let him lecture on Dante to the Studiolo."
00:30:08.709,00:30:12.000,Let him face them if he can.
00:30:12.041,00:30:14.000,Let's set a date.
00:30:14.041,00:30:15.917,Very well.
00:30:33.542,00:30:35.375,Dr. Fell?
00:30:36.542,00:30:39.500,Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi of the Questura.
00:30:39.542,00:30:42.917,Commendatore.
00:30:42.959,00:30:44.583,I'm sorry.
00:30:44.625,00:30:50.166,"the disappearance of your predecessor, Signore de Bonaventura."
00:30:50.208,00:30:53.083,- I was wondering if-- - Predecessor implies I have the job.
00:30:53.125,00:30:57.083,"Unfortunately, I don't."
00:30:57.125,00:31:00.709,They are letting me look after the library...
00:31:00.750,00:31:02.583,Hmm.
00:31:02.625,00:31:04.542,"Uh, the officers who first checked..."
00:31:04.583,00:31:09.208,didn't find any sort of farewell or suicide note.
00:31:09.250,00:31:11.375,- I was wondering if you-- - If I happen to come across anything...
00:31:11.417,00:31:16.250,"in the Capponi library stuffed in a drawer or book, yes, I'll call you at once."
00:31:18.083,00:31:20.083,Thank you.
00:31:21.166,00:31:22.917,You've been reassigned.
00:31:25.750,00:31:27.250,Pardon?
00:31:27.291,00:31:30.709,"You were on the Il Mostro case, I'm sure I read."
00:31:30.750,00:31:33.291,"Yes, that's right."
00:31:33.333,00:31:36.208,"This is much less grand a case, I would think."
00:31:36.250,00:31:41.625,"Well, if I thought of my work in those terms, yes, I guess I'd agree."
00:31:41.667,00:31:44.959,- A missing person.
00:31:45.083,00:31:48.834,"Were you unfairly dismissed from the grander case, or did you deserve it?"
00:31:55.250,00:32:00.750,"Regarding this one, Dr. Fell, are the Signore's personal effects still at the Palazzo?"
00:32:00.792,00:32:02.542,Mm-hmm.
00:32:02.583,00:32:06.125,Packed neatly in four cases with an inventory.
00:32:06.166,00:32:08.709,"Alas, no note."
00:32:08.750,00:32:10.291,Mm.
00:32:11.583,00:32:14.083,"Well, I'll send-- I'll send someone over to pick them up."
00:32:14.125,00:32:15.667,Thank you for your help.
00:32:26.166,00:32:28.083,"Hey, thanks."
00:32:29.709,00:32:32.083,How's it goin'?
00:32:32.083,00:32:36.083,"Yeah, they're all leads."
00:32:39.834,00:32:41.875,I don't know how you live with this stuff.
00:32:41.917,00:32:43.375,"Oh, God."
00:32:43.417,00:32:48.709,"This is from The Guinness Book of World Records, congratulating me on being The Female F.B.I. Agent..."
00:32:48.750,00:32:50.750,Who Has Shot and Killed the Most People.
00:33:14.458,00:33:16.417,"Geoffrey, would you excuse me, please?"
00:33:18.291,00:33:19.834,Sure.
00:33:46.458,00:33:53.083,"Dear Clarice, I have followed with enthusiasm the course of your disgrace and public shaming."
00:33:53.083,00:33:58.208,"My own never bothered me, except for the inconvenience of being incarcerated."
00:33:58.250,00:34:01.834,But you may lack perspective.
00:34:01.875,00:34:10.667,"In our discussions down in the dungeon, it was apparent to me that your father, the dead night watchman, figures largely in your value system."
00:34:12.375,00:34:16.834,I think your success in putting an end to Jame Gumb's career as a couturier...
00:34:16.875,00:34:21.250,pleased you most because you could imagine your father being pleased.
00:34:21.291,00:34:25.166,"But now, alas, you're in bad odor with the F.B.I."
00:34:25.208,00:34:28.917,Do you imagine your daddy being shamed by your disgrace?
00:34:28.959,00:34:32.750,"Do you see him in his plain pine box, crushed by your failure?"
00:34:32.792,00:34:36.583,"The sorry, petty end of a promising career?"
00:34:36.625,00:34:40.250,"What is worst about this humiliation, Clarice?"
00:34:40.291,00:34:43.917,Is it how your failure will reflect on your mommy and daddy?
00:34:45.375,00:34:48.250,Is your worst fear that people will now and forever believe...
00:34:48.291,00:34:53.583,"they were indeed just good ol' trailer camp, tornado-bait white trash?"
00:34:53.625,00:34:56.959,"And that perhaps you are too, hmm?"
00:34:59.208,00:35:02.375,"By the way, I couldn't help noticing on the F.B.I.'s rather dull public Web site..."
00:35:02.417,00:35:06.500,that I have been hoisted from the Bureau's archives of the common criminal...
00:35:06.542,00:35:11.959,and elevated to the more prestigious Ten Most Wanted list.
00:35:12.083,00:35:16.291,"Is this coincidence, or are you back on the case?"
00:35:16.333,00:35:19.667,"If so, goody-goody, because I need to come out of retirement..."
00:35:19.709,00:35:22.125,and return to public life.
00:35:25.709,00:35:31.291,"I imagine you sitting in a dark basement room, bent over papers and computer screens."
00:35:31.333,00:35:33.875,Is that accurate?
00:35:33.917,00:35:37.750,"Please tell me truly, Special Agent Starling."
00:35:37.792,00:35:42.667,"Regards, your old pal, Hannibal Lecter, M.D."
00:35:44.375,00:35:48.959,"P.S.-- Clearly, this new assignment is not your choice."
00:35:49.083,00:35:51.291,"Rather, I suppose, it is part of the bargain."
00:35:51.333,00:35:53.792,"But you accepted it, Clarice."
00:35:53.834,00:36:01.667,"Your job is to craft my doom, so I am not sure how well I should wish you, but I'm sure we'll have a lot of fun."
00:36:01.709,00:36:04.166,Ta-ta. H.
00:36:11.917,00:36:16.083,"On the letter, there's one partial fingerprint here."
00:36:16.083,00:36:19.125,"Not enough to hold up in court, but-- Well, I-I know it's him."
00:36:19.166,00:36:21.667,Where he was when he wrote it is what I need.
00:36:21.709,00:36:23.959,"Well, the paper isn't gonna help."
00:36:24.083,00:36:26.375,"And, yes, it's linen fiber."
00:36:26.417,00:36:29.166,But it isn't so rare that you're not gonna be able to find it...
00:36:29.208,00:36:33.250,it in a thousand different stationery stores throughout the world.
00:36:33.291,00:36:37.291,It's the same with the ink and the same with the wax.
00:36:37.333,00:36:43.792,"And your Las Vegas postmark, well, you can check it out, but I'll bet you a dollar it came from a remailing service."
00:36:43.834,00:36:46.083,"No, Las Vegas would be the last place he'd be."
00:36:46.083,00:36:49.083,It'd be an assault on his sense of taste.
00:36:55.625,00:36:59.792,"Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice?"
00:36:59.834,00:37:02.375,I hardly see how you couldn't.
00:37:02.417,00:37:06.834,And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
00:37:06.875,00:37:09.083,"All right then, tell me how."
00:37:09.125,00:37:12.417,"No, it's your turn to tell me, Clarice."
00:37:12.458,00:37:17.166,You don't have any more vacations to sell on Anthrax Island.
00:37:17.208,00:37:22.208,"Quid pro quo, Clarice."
00:37:22.250,00:37:25.709,Not about this case.
00:37:25.750,00:37:30.166,Quid pro quo.
00:37:42.333,00:37:44.208,Hand cream.
00:37:45.500,00:37:47.834,Raw ambergris base.
00:37:49.333,00:37:51.667,Tennessee lavender.
00:37:52.667,00:37:56.083,Trace of something else.
00:37:56.083,00:37:58.083,Fleece.
00:37:58.083,00:38:00.542,Lovely.
00:38:00.583,00:38:02.959,What's ambergris?
00:38:03.083,00:38:05.083,Ambergris is a whale product.
00:38:05.083,00:38:07.792,"Alas, much as we'd like to, we can't import it."
00:38:07.834,00:38:10.625,Endangered Species Act.
00:38:10.667,00:38:14.166,Where isn't it illegal?
00:38:14.208,00:38:20.291,"You'd almost certainly find it somewhere in Paris, Rome, Amsterdam."
00:38:20.333,00:38:22.166,Maybe London.
00:38:22.208,00:38:26.667,"Uh, this bouquet, uh, was hand-engineered to someone's specifications."
00:38:26.709,00:38:28.750,Is there any way of knowing which shops?
00:38:28.792,00:38:32.125,Of course.
00:38:44.709,00:38:47.083,I need opera tickets.
00:38:47.083,00:38:49.709,I don't think I got any on me.
00:38:49.750,00:38:52.417,"It's sold out, whatever it's called."
00:38:52.458,00:38:56.208,It's the pretty young wife with the ever-open beak who needs opera tickets.
00:39:05.792,00:39:07.125,Benetti.
00:39:07.166,00:39:08.542,Rewind it.
00:39:08.583,00:39:11.417,I can't rewind it.
00:39:23.333,00:39:27.709,- What is this?
00:39:27.750,00:39:29.625,F.B.I. through Interpol requested a copy.
00:39:29.667,00:39:32.083,Why?
00:39:33.750,00:39:37.125,- They didn't say?
00:39:37.166,00:39:40.083,Like they were making a point not to say.
00:39:44.750,00:39:46.834,Hmm.
00:41:25.083,00:41:28.834,Are we going to the opera?
00:41:28.875,00:41:32.250,"Yes, we are going."
00:41:32.291,00:41:35.583,"No, but I will."
00:41:37.083,00:41:39.333,"Please, not the back row."
00:41:39.375,00:41:41.166,I would like to see it this time.
00:41:42.417,00:41:46.959,Nowhere near the back row.
00:43:56.083,00:44:00.500,"Tell me, Clarice, would you want to harm those who have forced you to consider it though?"
00:44:00.542,00:44:02.625,It's perfectly okay to admit it.
00:44:02.667,00:44:07.625,It's perfectly au naturel to want to taste the enemy.
00:44:22.583,00:44:24.917,It just feels so good.
00:44:24.959,00:44:27.834,What is your worst memory of childhood?
00:44:27.875,00:44:30.083,"Jesus, Starling!"
00:44:30.083,00:44:32.125,"What the hell you doing sitting there in the dark, Starling?"
00:44:32.166,00:44:34.750,Thinkin' about cannibalism.
00:44:34.792,00:44:37.917,People in Justice are thinking too.
00:44:37.959,00:44:40.166,"They're thinking, What exactly is she doing about Lecter?"
00:44:40.208,00:44:42.417,Aren't you curious why he dines on his victims?
00:44:42.458,00:44:46.875,And what's the point of that?
00:44:46.917,00:44:50.250,To show his contempt for those who exasperate him.
00:44:50.291,00:44:54.208,Ah.
00:44:54.250,00:45:04.625,"In the case of the flutist, Benjamin Raspail, he did it to improve the sound of the Baltimore Philharmonic Orchestra, serving the not-so-talented flute player's sweetbreads to the board..."
00:45:04.667,00:45:07.417,with a nice Montrachet at $700 a bottle.
00:45:08.667,00:45:10.583,Wow.
00:45:10.625,00:45:23.375,"That meal began with green oysters from the Gironde, followed by the sweetbreads, a sorbet, and then you can read here in Gourmet Cuisine: A notable dark and glossy ragout, the constituents never determined."
00:45:23.417,00:45:26.375,I always figured him for a queer.
00:45:26.417,00:45:28.375,"Why would you say that, Paul?"
00:45:28.417,00:45:31.458,"Well, all this artsy-fartsy stuff."
00:45:31.500,00:45:33.500,"Chamber music, tea-party food."
00:45:33.542,00:45:38.625,"N-N-Not that I mean anything personal, if you've got a lot of sympathy for those people."
00:45:40.625,00:45:45.375,"What I came here to impress upon you, Starling, is I better see cooperation."
00:45:45.417,00:45:47.917,There are no little fiefdoms here.
00:45:47.959,00:45:52.083,"I want to be copied on every 302, you understand?"
00:45:52.083,00:45:57.291,"If you work with me, then your so-called career here might improve."
00:45:58.333,00:46:02.750,"If you don't, then all I have to do..."
00:46:02.792,00:46:07.792,"is draw a line through your name rather than under it, and it's over."
00:46:07.834,00:46:10.500,"Paul, what is it with you?"
00:46:10.542,00:46:13.458,I told you to go home to your wife.
00:46:13.500,00:46:16.959,"Don't flatter yourself, Starling."
00:46:17.083,00:46:19.625,That was a long time ago.
00:46:19.667,00:46:23.917,Why would I hold that against you? Hmm?
00:46:23.959,00:46:28.667,"And besides, this town is full of cornpone, country pussy."
00:46:30.542,00:46:35.375,"That said, I wouldn't mind having a go with you right now, if you want to reconsider."
00:46:35.417,00:46:38.834,"In the gym, anytime."
00:46:43.166,00:46:45.959,Is it possible it went out with the regular mail?
00:46:46.083,00:46:50.166,"No, I overnighted it to you."
00:46:50.208,00:46:52.250,This was the day after your request.
00:46:52.291,00:46:54.208,I did it right away.
00:46:54.250,00:46:57.333,I don't understand what happened. I think you should have it by now.
00:46:57.375,00:46:59.792,I don't.
00:46:59.834,00:47:02.417,Sure.
00:47:02.458,00:47:06.166,Agent... Clarice?
00:47:06.208,00:47:10.500,"Uh, Agent Starling."
00:47:10.542,00:47:14.083,"Oh, my name is Franco Benetti."
00:47:14.125,00:47:16.750,"Well, thank you very much, Agent Benetti."
00:47:16.792,00:47:19.542,"So, I'll send you tomorrow?"
00:47:19.583,00:47:21.375,Bye-bye.
00:47:22.333,00:47:24.458,"Nothin', huh?"
00:47:24.500,00:47:26.875,Still waitin' on Florence and London.
00:48:04.375,00:48:07.542,The number you have dialed is not in service at this time.
00:48:07.583,00:48:35.542,Please check the numb-- Yes? Hello?
00:48:35.583,00:48:38.417,I have information about Hannibal Lecter.
00:48:38.458,00:48:41.375,"Have you shared your information with the police, sir?"
00:48:41.417,00:48:43.917,I'm required to encourage you to do so.
00:48:43.959,00:48:45.834,Uh-huh.
00:48:45.875,00:48:50.083,Is the reward payable under special circumstances?
00:48:50.083,00:48:52.375,May I suggest you contact an attorney...
00:48:52.417,00:48:55.500,before taking any possibly illegal action?
00:48:55.542,00:48:58.583,There's one in Geneva who is excellent in these matters.
00:48:58.625,00:49:00.542,May I give you his toll-free number?
00:49:00.583,00:49:06.500,The number is 00 412 33 17.
00:49:06.542,00:49:08.917,Thank you for calling.
00:49:25.834,00:49:27.834,Hello?
00:49:27.875,00:49:33.208,"Uh, yes, I was just speaking with someone who suggested I-- There's a $100,000 advance."
00:49:33.250,00:49:39.166,"To qualify for the advance, a fingerprint must be provided, in situ, on an object."
00:49:39.208,00:49:46.333,"Once the print has been positively identified, the balance of the money will be placed in escrow at Genève Credit Suisse..."
00:49:46.375,00:49:51.166,and may be viewed at any time subject to 24-hour prior notification.
00:49:51.208,00:49:53.667,"To repeat the message in French, press two."
00:49:53.709,00:49:56.667,"In Spanish, press three."
00:49:53.709,00:50:26.291,In German-- - Buon giorno.
00:50:26.333,00:50:28.792,"Yes, I can see you."
00:50:28.834,00:50:31.875,Come on up.
00:50:42.750,00:50:44.625,Dr. Fell?
00:50:49.417,00:50:51.500,Hello?
00:50:56.375,00:50:58.458,Dr. Fell?
00:51:04.417,00:51:06.083,Dr. Fell?
00:51:08.458,00:51:10.083,Hello?
00:51:22.583,00:51:25.834,- Snap.
00:51:25.875,00:51:27.834,I should have encouraged you to bring someone along.
00:51:27.875,00:51:30.417,"The cases, I'm afraid, are on the heavy side."
00:51:30.458,00:51:32.750,"Well, maybe you could help me with them."
00:51:32.792,00:51:35.792,Hmm?
00:51:38.792,00:51:40.417,Yeah.
00:51:40.458,00:51:42.083,This way.
00:51:43.375,00:51:45.250,Here we are.
00:51:49.542,00:51:51.959,Is that the inventory?
00:51:54.166,00:51:57.083,May I see it?
00:52:06.834,00:52:12.083,"You are a Pazzi of the Pazzi family, I think."
00:52:12.083,00:52:13.542,Mm.
00:52:13.583,00:52:17.625,Wasn't it at the Palazzo Vecchio your ancestor was hanged?
00:52:17.667,00:52:19.792,Francesco de' Pazzi?
00:52:19.834,00:52:26.667,"Yes, thrown naked with a noose around his neck from a window, writhing and kicking alongside the archbishop..."
00:52:26.709,00:52:29.667,against the cold stone wall.
00:52:29.709,00:52:32.917,"In fact, I found a very nice rendering of it..."
00:52:32.959,00:52:36.083,here in the library the other day.
00:52:36.083,00:52:39.875,"If you like, perhaps I could, uh, sneak it out for you."
00:52:39.917,00:52:42.333,I would think...
00:52:42.375,00:52:46.709,that might jeopardize your chances for permanent appointment to the curatorship.
00:52:46.750,00:52:48.875,Only if you told.
00:52:50.333,00:52:53.291,Remind me-- What was his crime?
00:52:53.333,00:52:56.083,He was accused of killing Giuliano de' Medici.
00:52:56.083,00:52:57.500,Oh. Unjustly?
00:52:57.542,00:53:01.333,"No. No, I don't think so."
00:53:01.375,00:53:04.417,Then he wasn't just accused.
00:53:04.458,00:53:09.083,I think that would make living in Florence with the name Pazzi...
00:53:09.083,00:53:12.083,"uncomfortable, even 500 years later."
00:53:13.291,00:53:15.583,Not really.
00:53:15.625,00:53:18.083,"In fact, I can't remember the last time..."
00:53:18.083,00:53:22.625,before today...
00:53:30.417,00:53:34.375,People don't always tell you what they're thinking.
00:53:34.417,00:53:36.458,They just see to it you don't...
00:53:36.500,00:53:39.667,advance in life.
00:53:43.458,00:53:45.959,"I'm sorry, Commendatore."
00:53:46.083,00:53:48.750,I too often say what I'm thinking.
00:53:50.709,00:53:52.667,I'll be right back to help you.
00:54:02.625,00:54:04.667,Yes.
00:54:07.250,00:54:12.375,"You know, the room you're standing in was built in the 15th century."
00:54:12.417,00:54:14.583,It's beautiful.
00:54:14.625,00:54:16.792,"Yes, it is."
00:54:16.834,00:54:19.125,"Unfortunately, I think..."
00:54:19.166,00:54:22.083,the heating system was installed about the same time.
00:54:24.417,00:54:27.625,That's a pity.
00:54:29.750,00:54:32.834,Okeydokey.
00:54:33.834,00:54:36.250,They must be as heavy as bodies.
00:55:05.834,00:55:08.291,And the set?
00:55:08.333,00:55:09.875,Okay.
00:55:09.917,00:55:13.792,Hey.
00:55:13.834,00:55:16.125,Fifty thousand.
00:55:37.709,00:55:39.208,"Scusi, signor."
00:55:40.083,00:55:41.417,Well done.
00:55:44.208,00:55:46.083,Gnocco.
00:55:50.208,00:55:54.083,"When you go for his wallet, he'll catch you by the wrist."
00:55:54.125,00:55:56.250,"I have done this a few times, Inspector."
00:55:56.291,00:55:57.792,Not like this.
00:55:58.917,00:56:06.083,"If there isn't a clean print on the bracelet, you'll spend the summer in a cell at the Sollicciano."
00:56:08.083,00:56:10.750,Give me the bracelet.
00:56:10.792,00:56:12.959,Wash your fucking hands.
00:56:22.917,00:56:25.333,He's coming.
00:57:13.417,00:57:15.208,Grazie.
00:58:14.792,00:58:16.959,I got it.
00:58:22.875,00:58:24.917,He grabbed me just right.
00:58:27.959,00:58:30.458,Tried to hit me in the balls.
00:58:34.333,00:58:36.125,But he missed.
00:58:40.792,00:58:43.417,Let me help you.
00:58:43.458,00:58:45.542,No. Don't.
00:59:41.166,00:59:44.166,"Sixteen-point match, Mr. Verger."
00:59:45.834,00:59:47.625,Bingo.
01:00:05.417,01:00:08.083,Pronto.
01:00:08.125,01:00:11.291,- Mason?
01:00:11.333,01:00:14.125,"Uh, well, well, well."
01:00:14.166,01:00:18.125,Am I coming to see you?
01:00:18.166,01:00:21.500,"But, uh-- But first I need you to pack off the boys."
01:00:21.542,01:00:23.583,Now?
01:00:23.625,01:00:26.709,"Yes, I know."
01:00:26.750,01:00:29.417,"Now, Cordell will fax the veterinary forms..."
01:00:29.458,01:00:36.500,"directly to, uh, Animal and Plant Health, but you need to get the vet affidavits from Sardinia."
01:00:36.542,01:00:38.333,Yeah. Va bene?
01:00:38.375,01:00:40.458,Uh-huh.
01:00:40.500,01:00:42.333,"Uh, how are they?"
01:00:42.375,01:00:44.667,"Ah, they are big, Mason, very big."
01:00:44.709,01:00:48.250,Tommaso.
01:00:51.500,01:00:54.500,- Say again?
01:00:54.542,01:00:58.500,- Really big Maybe 270 kilos.
01:00:58.542,01:01:01.083,"Oh, wow."
01:01:01.083,01:01:02.583,Can you hear?
01:01:04.542,01:01:06.083,Hear!
01:01:14.250,01:01:17.208,"Oh, they sound fantastic."
01:01:26.625,01:01:28.458,"Oh, super."
01:02:03.417,01:02:05.250,The full balance of the money...
01:02:05.291,01:02:08.625,"is payable upon receipt of the doctor, alive."
01:02:08.667,01:02:11.333,Of course you won't have to seize him yourself.
01:02:11.375,01:02:13.375,"Rather, just point him out."
01:02:13.417,01:02:16.125,"In fact, it's preferable to all concerned..."
01:02:16.166,01:02:18.250,if that's the extent of your involvement...
01:02:18.291,01:02:19.959,from this point.
01:02:20.083,01:02:24.291,"I prefer to stay involved, make sure things go right."
01:02:24.333,01:02:26.291,Professionals will see to that.
01:02:28.083,01:02:30.125,I am a professional.
01:04:37.208,01:04:38.917,Bravo! Bravo!
01:04:51.583,01:04:53.375,Bravo.
01:04:53.417,01:04:55.417,"Did you enjoy the performance, Commendatore?"
01:04:55.458,01:04:57.458,"Oh, very much."
01:04:57.500,01:05:01.750,"Um, Allegra, this is Dr. Fell, curator of the Capponi Library."
01:05:01.792,01:05:03.792,Signora Pazzi.
01:05:03.834,01:05:05.750,I'm honored.
01:05:05.792,01:05:07.750,"Are you from America, Doctor?"
01:05:07.792,01:05:10.583,Not originally.
01:05:10.625,01:05:13.625,I've always wanted to visit.
01:05:13.667,01:05:16.500,I've enjoyed many excellent meals there.
01:05:17.667,01:05:21.250,I noticed you wrapped up in the libretto.
01:05:21.291,01:05:23.291,Thought this might amuse you.
01:05:25.417,01:05:28.291,Dante's first sonnet from La Vita Nuova.
01:05:28.333,01:05:30.333,Mm-hmm.
01:05:31.375,01:05:34.458,"- Rinaldo, look at this."
01:05:36.083,01:05:43.291,"Joyous Love seemed to me, the while he held my heart in his hands, and in his arms..."
01:05:43.333,01:05:47.834,"my lady lay asleep, wrapped in a veil."
01:05:47.875,01:05:54.834,"He woke her then, and trembling and obedient, she ate that burning heart out of his hand."
01:05:54.875,01:05:57.166,"Weeping, I saw him then depart from me."
01:05:57.208,01:05:59.792,"Dr. Fell, do you believe a man..."
01:05:59.834,01:06:03.125,could become so obsessed with a woman...
01:06:03.166,01:06:05.792,from a single encounter?
01:06:05.834,01:06:08.792,Could he daily feel a stab of hunger for her...
01:06:08.834,01:06:11.875,and find nourishment in the very sight of her?
01:06:11.917,01:06:13.834,I think so.
01:06:13.875,01:06:16.500,But would she see through the bars of his plight...
01:06:16.542,01:06:18.625,and ache for him?
01:06:18.667,01:06:20.917,Please keep that.
01:06:20.959,01:06:22.834,I insist.
01:06:24.250,01:06:26.125,Commendatore.
01:06:26.166,01:06:28.083,Allegra.
01:06:30.500,01:06:32.834,Ciao.
01:06:32.875,01:06:34.375,Good-bye.
01:06:35.834,01:06:37.375,Let's get something to eat.
01:06:38.750,01:06:40.875,Why not?
01:07:13.375,01:07:15.417,"Is that you, Doctor?"
01:08:04.625,01:08:06.208,Questura.
01:08:06.250,01:08:09.083,I'd like to speak with Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi.
01:08:09.125,01:08:12.542,This is Agent Clarice Starling from the American F.B.I.
01:08:12.583,01:08:13.792,"Ah, one moment."
01:08:15.083,01:08:17.291,Pazzi! F.B.I.
01:08:17.333,01:08:19.583,I'm not here.
01:08:23.250,01:08:27.458,- Pazzi.
01:08:27.500,01:08:29.583,- How do you do?
01:08:29.625,01:08:33.291,"Actually, I was just leaving for the day."
01:08:33.333,01:08:36.834,"Uh, this won't take long."
01:08:36.875,01:08:39.250,for sending us the security tape from the perfume store.
01:08:39.291,01:08:43.834,"When I say you, I mean your department, Agent Benetti."
01:08:43.875,01:08:46.333,Is he there?
01:08:46.375,01:08:48.291,Sorry. He's gone home.
01:08:48.333,01:08:51.500,That's all right.
01:08:51.542,01:08:54.125,"Uh, I'm late for an important le-- an important appointment."
01:08:54.166,01:08:59.834,"Well, the person I'm looking for, Inspector, who is indeed shown on that tape, is Hannibal Lecter."
01:09:00.667,01:09:02.834,- Who?
01:09:02.875,01:09:04.667,You've never heard of him?
01:09:04.709,01:09:07.333,"Uh, I'm sorry."
01:09:07.375,01:09:11.083,"And the tape confirms that he is, or was recently, in Florence."
01:09:12.417,01:09:15.750,"Oh, really?"
01:09:15.792,01:09:19.166,He's killed 14 people that we know of.
01:09:19.208,01:09:21.750,"I really have to go, Miss-- Starling."
01:09:21.792,01:09:25.083,Just another minute.
01:09:25.083,01:09:26.500,"No, I haven't."
01:09:26.542,01:09:29.417,Because I'm confused.
01:09:29.458,01:09:33.083,has been accessing our private VICAP files on Dr. Lecter...
01:09:33.083,01:09:35.917,with some regularity...
01:09:35.959,01:09:40.291,"Well, everybody uses everybody's computer here."
01:09:40.333,01:09:47.583,"Maybe one of the detectives on Il Mostro was looking at profiles of killers-- I'm speaking about the computer at your home, sir."
01:09:49.500,01:09:52.709,"You're trying to catch him yourself, aren't you?"
01:09:52.750,01:09:55.375,I cannot warn you strongly enough against that.
01:09:55.417,01:10:39.291,"He killed three policemen down in Memphis while in custody, tearing the face off one of them, and he will kill you too-- Yes?"
01:10:39.333,01:10:43.250,"Believe me, he'll be gone from the face of the Earth fast."
01:10:43.291,01:10:44.875,Feet first.
01:11:00.750,01:11:02.709,"Buona sera, professore."
01:11:04.834,01:11:09.083,avarice and his betrayal of the Emperor's trust-- Professore.
01:11:09.125,01:11:12.583,"Pier della Vigna was disgraced, blinded and imprisoned."
01:11:12.625,01:11:18.166,Dante's pilgrim finds Pier della Vigna on the seventh level of the Inferno.
01:11:18.208,01:11:21.834,"Like Judas Iscariot, he died by hanging."
01:11:21.875,01:11:24.750,So Judas and Pier della Vigna are linked in Dante...
01:11:24.792,01:11:27.125,by the avarice he saw in them.
01:11:27.166,01:11:31.417,"In fact, avarice and hanging are linked in the medieval mind."
01:11:32.959,01:11:35.125,This is the earliest known depiction of the crucifixion...
01:11:35.166,01:11:39.333,carved in an ivory box in Gaul about A.D. 400.
01:11:39.375,01:11:46.333,"It includes the death, by hanging, of Judas, his face upturned to the branch that suspends him."
01:11:46.375,01:11:52.667,"Here he is again on the doors of the Benevento Cathedral, this time, with his bowels falling out."
01:11:56.208,01:11:58.500,"- Ah, Commendatore Pazzi."
01:12:00.667,01:12:05.083,"but I got this number without tellin' 'em why, Inspector-- Sorry."
01:12:05.125,01:12:06.333,Not at all.
01:12:06.375,01:12:09.667,Please join us.
01:12:09.709,01:12:16.291,"from the 15 century edition of the Inferno, Pier della Vigna's body hangs from a bleeding tree."
01:12:16.333,01:12:22.333,"I will not belabor the obvious parallel with, uh, Judas Iscariot, but Dante Alighieri needed no drawn illustration."
01:12:22.375,01:12:27.959,It was his genius to...
01:12:22.375,01:12:34.083,"make Pier della Vigna, now in hell, speak in strained hisses and coughing sibilants, as though he is hanging still."
01:12:35.291,01:12:45.208,"Come l'altre verrem per nostre spoglie, ma non però ch'alcuna sen rivesta, ché non è giusto aver ciò ch'om si toglie."
01:12:45.250,01:12:49.083,"Qui le strascineremo, e per la mesta selva..."
01:12:49.083,01:12:55.458,"saranno i nostri corpi appesi, ciascuno al prun de l'ombra sua molesta."
01:12:57.792,01:13:02.208,"Avarice, hanging, self-destruction."
01:13:02.250,01:13:06.208,Io fei gibbetto a me de le mie case.
01:13:06.250,01:13:11.125,I make my own home...
01:13:12.625,01:13:15.834,"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your kind attention."
01:13:32.083,01:13:34.750,"I'm not a scholar, but I think you've got the job."
01:13:34.792,01:13:36.417,Thank you.
01:13:36.458,01:13:39.208,May I buy you a drink?
01:13:39.250,01:13:41.667,I'll be a minute gathering my things.
01:13:41.709,01:13:44.250,"Oh, well, take your time."
01:13:52.333,01:13:53.917,Yeah?
01:13:53.959,01:13:58.125,"Allegra, I'll be home just a little later than I said."
01:13:58.166,01:14:02.291,I'm taking Dr. Fell out for a drink.
01:14:02.333,01:14:05.959,"Yeah, I can see the people coming out now."
01:14:08.083,01:14:10.875,"Yes, bye, honey."
01:14:10.917,01:14:13.291,My wife.
01:14:15.166,01:14:17.917,"Oh, I should have shown them this one."
01:14:17.959,01:14:19.959,I can't imagine how I missed it.
01:14:20.083,01:14:21.500,"Remember, I told you about it."
01:14:21.542,01:14:24.792,It's a rendering I found in the Capponi library.
01:14:24.834,01:14:27.417,Can you make it out?
01:14:27.458,01:14:29.291,There's a name there.
01:14:30.083,01:14:32.083,The one I told you about?
01:14:45.208,01:14:50.417,"It's your ancestor, Commendatore, hanging beneath these very windows."
01:14:50.458,01:14:51.959,Francesco de' Pazzi.
01:14:53.333,01:14:57.083,"On a related subject, I must confess to you."
01:14:57.083,01:14:59.333,I'm giving very serious thought...
01:15:05.500,01:15:07.917,to eating your wife.
01:15:14.500,01:15:16.083,"Shh, shh, shh."
01:15:41.375,01:15:46.458,"If you tell me what I need to know, Commendatore, it might be convenient for me to leave Florence without my meal."
01:15:46.500,01:15:50.542,"So I'll ask you the questions, and then we'll see, all right?"
01:15:50.583,01:15:52.166,Okay?
01:16:03.875,01:16:10.458,"So-- Now, was it Mason Verger you sold me to?"
01:16:12.083,01:16:14.208,"No, no."
01:16:14.250,01:16:16.875,"Blink twice for yes, once for no."
01:16:16.917,01:16:19.208,Was it Mason Verger you sold me to?
01:16:21.125,01:16:23.166,"Yes, good."
01:16:23.208,01:16:26.125,And are his men waiting for me outside?
01:16:27.542,01:16:29.875,Was that a single blink?
01:16:29.917,01:16:31.917,"Oh, you're confused."
01:16:31.959,01:16:35.834,"Well, please don't be confused, because I may have to fillet Signora Pazzi after all."
01:16:38.792,01:16:41.333,Have you told anyone in the questura about me?
01:16:43.208,01:16:44.750,"No, I thought not."
01:16:45.709,01:16:48.500,Have you told... Allegra?
01:16:51.166,01:16:53.083,No? Are you sure?
01:16:55.417,01:16:57.291,I believe you.
01:16:59.250,01:17:02.083,Okeydokey. Here we go.
01:17:08.208,01:17:11.083,Okay.
01:17:11.125,01:17:12.625,Your heart is really palpitating.
01:17:13.667,01:17:15.792,"Oh, it's not your heart."
01:17:15.834,01:17:19.625,"Well, shall I answer it?"
01:17:21.583,01:17:23.291,Pronto.
01:17:23.333,01:17:24.750,I've spoken to your section chief.
01:17:24.792,01:17:27.834,Someday you'll thank me.
01:17:27.875,01:17:30.166,You'll be alive.
01:17:30.208,01:17:32.208,Inspector Pazzi?
01:17:33.166,01:17:35.291,Is this Clarice?
01:17:36.083,01:17:38.875,"Well, hello, Clarice."
01:17:38.917,01:17:40.834,I'm afraid I have bad news for you.
01:17:40.875,01:17:42.834,Is he dead?
01:17:42.875,01:17:44.458,Did you get my note?
01:17:44.500,01:17:46.792,I hope you liked the skin cream.
01:17:46.834,01:17:49.083,"Is he dead, Dr. Lecter?"
01:17:49.083,01:17:51.333,"Clarice, there's nothing in this world that I would love more..."
01:17:51.375,01:17:52.959,than to be able to chat with you.
01:17:53.083,01:17:56.542,"Unfortunately, you've caught me at an awkward moment."
01:17:56.583,01:17:58.834,Please forgive me.
01:17:58.875,01:18:00.333,See you around.
01:18:02.667,01:18:04.542,An old friend.
01:18:08.917,01:18:10.667,"Okay, hold on."
01:18:11.917,01:18:13.500,Here we go.
01:18:53.291,01:18:57.250,"So, what's it to be?"
01:18:57.291,01:18:59.583,Like Judas?
01:18:59.625,01:19:02.166,Are you confused?
01:19:02.208,01:19:04.166,"Then I'll decide for you, if you'll permit me."
01:19:06.458,01:19:07.750,Ciao.
01:20:07.792,01:20:09.709,Carlo!
01:20:13.542,01:20:15.542,Carlo!
01:20:16.125,01:20:17.792,Yes?
01:20:17.834,01:20:18.834,Good evening.
01:21:26.583,01:21:35.750,"Cordell, to you, does that look like a wave good-bye..."
01:21:35.792,01:21:38.083,or hello?
01:22:23.333,01:22:25.583,"So, what do you think?"
01:22:26.834,01:22:30.333,Does Lecter want to...
01:22:30.375,01:22:32.208,or eat her or what?
01:22:32.250,01:22:34.792,Probably all three.
01:22:34.834,01:22:37.291,Though I wouldn't want to predict in what order.
01:22:37.333,01:22:39.875,Here's what I think.
01:22:41.500,01:22:45.709,No matter how Barney might want to romanticize it...
01:22:45.750,01:22:57.458,"or make it Beauty and the Beast, Lecter's object, as I know from personal experience, has always been degradation..."
01:22:57.500,01:23:01.500,"and suffering, but-- Cordell, get this damn thing off me."
01:23:01.542,01:23:04.667,I can't... breathe in this thing.
01:23:07.291,01:23:13.750,"He comes in the guise of a mentor, as he did with me..."
01:23:13.792,01:23:17.834,But it's distress that excites him.
01:23:17.875,01:23:19.583,To draw him...
01:23:21.125,01:23:22.917,she needs to be distressed.
01:23:26.375,01:23:31.542,"To make her attractive to him, let him see her distressed."
01:23:32.750,01:23:35.458,Let the damage he sees...
01:23:35.500,01:23:38.583,suggest the damage he could do.
01:23:47.875,01:23:51.875,"When the fox hears the rabbit scream, he comes a-runnin'."
01:23:53.250,01:23:55.333,But not to help.
01:23:55.375,01:23:57.083,I don't understand.
01:23:57.083,01:23:59.709,"Well, there's nothing to understand, Paul."
01:23:59.750,01:24:03.250,All you have to understand is is what it's worth to you.
01:24:03.291,01:24:06.500,"No, no, I don't understand why she didn't turn this over."
01:24:06.542,01:24:08.333,"I mean, she's-- she such a straight arrow."
01:24:08.375,01:24:12.083,She didn't turn it over because she didn't receive it.
01:24:12.083,01:24:14.583,"She didn't receive it, because it was never sent."
01:24:14.625,01:24:16.542,"It was never sent, because Lecter didn't write it."
01:24:16.583,01:24:19.166,"He didn't write it, because I did."
01:24:19.208,01:24:22.875,Ohh!
01:24:24.458,01:24:26.625,"So, what do you think?"
01:24:26.667,01:24:28.083,I think you'd have been better off...
01:24:28.125,01:24:29.750,if you never got her out of trouble in the first place.
01:24:29.792,01:24:31.166,"Oh, woulda, shoulda, coulda!"
01:24:31.208,01:24:34.125,"I meant, what do you think about the money?"
01:24:34.166,01:24:35.250,Five.
01:24:35.291,01:24:40.750,"Ha! Oh, let's just-- Let's just toss it off, like, five."
01:24:40.792,01:24:43.750,Let's say it with the respect it deserves.
01:24:43.792,01:24:46.834,Five hundred thousand dollars.
01:24:46.875,01:24:48.750,"Yeah, that's better."
01:24:48.792,01:24:51.333,"Well, will it work?"
01:24:51.375,01:24:55.375,It won't be pretty.
01:24:59.083,01:25:01.125,Cocksucker.
01:25:01.166,01:25:04.250,I've never seen this before in my life.
01:25:04.291,01:25:07.500,Then how do you account for its being found in your office?
01:25:07.542,01:25:09.083,Your basement.
01:25:09.083,01:25:10.959,"How do you want me to answer that, Mr. Krendler?"
01:25:11.083,01:25:13.959,Let me ask you this.
01:25:14.083,01:25:16.959,"Well, perhaps because of the nature of its content."
01:25:18.417,01:25:21.291,Reads to me like a-- like a love letter.
01:25:21.333,01:25:23.500,Has it been tested for prints?
01:25:23.542,01:25:25.667,- None on the last one.
01:25:25.709,01:25:29.750,"Did you ever think, Clarice, why the Philistines don't understand you?"
01:25:29.792,01:25:32.709,It's because you're the answer to Samson's riddle.
01:25:32.750,01:25:34.917,You are the honey in the lion.
01:25:34.959,01:25:38.375,Sounds like him to me.
01:25:38.417,01:25:42.083,Like a nut with a crush.
01:25:42.083,01:25:44.166,I am placing you on administrative leave...
01:25:44.208,01:25:48.667,till Document Analysis tells me unequivocally a mistake's been made.
01:25:48.709,01:25:52.083,"In the meantime, you remain eligible for insurance and medical benefits."
01:25:52.083,01:25:55.125,Surrender your weapons and your identification to Agent Pearsall.
01:26:08.083,01:26:10.917,I want to say something.
01:26:10.959,01:26:12.709,Go ahead.
01:26:14.083,01:26:16.375,I think Mr. Mason Verger's trying to capture Dr. Lecter...
01:26:16.417,01:26:18.208,for the purposes of personal revenge.
01:26:18.250,01:26:21.083,I think Mr. Krendler is in collusion with him...
01:26:21.083,01:26:23.959,and wants the F.B.I.'s efforts against Dr. Lecter to work for Mr. Verger.
01:26:24.083,01:26:26.959,I think Mr. Krendler is being paid to do this.
01:26:27.083,01:26:28.709,"You're lucky you're not sworn here today, Starling."
01:26:28.750,01:26:30.709,Swear me!
01:26:30.750,01:26:36.250,"Clarice, if the evidence is lacking, you'll be entitled to full reinstatement without prejudice."
01:26:36.291,01:26:40.750,If you don't do or say anything in the meantime...
01:26:40.792,01:26:43.375,that would make that impossible.
01:26:43.417,01:26:46.083,Relieved of field duty pending an internal investigation...
01:26:46.125,01:26:53.458,"into the charges, Special Agent Clarice Starling, a 10-year veteran on the Bureau, began her career with an assignment to interview lethal madman Hannibal Lecter."
01:26:55.333,01:26:57.709,"Earlier, we heard comments from Justice Department spokesman Paul Krendler."
01:26:57.750,01:26:59.625,There he is!
01:26:59.667,01:27:00.917,Can you comment on the Justice Department's...
01:27:00.959,01:27:02.875,decision at this morning's meeting?
01:27:02.917,01:27:06.083,The F.B.I. and the Justice Department are looking very carefully into the charges.
01:27:06.083,01:27:09.083,"And, yes, they're extremely serious."
01:27:09.083,01:27:10.834,I-I-I'd like to add a personal note though.
01:27:10.875,01:27:13.500,Starling is one of the best agents that we have.
01:27:13.542,01:27:15.500,"No, no, no, no, no. Stay. Stay."
01:27:13.542,01:27:18.792,"Having known her for a number of years, I would be very surprised if these accusations turn out to be true."
01:27:18.834,01:27:23.166,Is it true that Agent Starling-- Department and the F.B.I.
01:27:23.208,01:27:25.625,It's much too soon to condemn her. Okay?
01:27:25.667,01:27:48.083,"Mr. Krend-- Shh, shh."
01:27:52.333,01:27:54.875,Shh.
01:28:11.083,01:28:13.834,Good boy.
01:28:13.875,01:28:15.834,Shh.
01:28:25.291,01:28:27.250,"Ah, and this."
01:28:43.208,01:30:57.333,Dr. Levin-- I think she's nice.
01:30:57.375,01:31:00.500,She's always been nice to me.
01:31:00.542,01:31:02.125,Don't you think?
01:31:02.166,01:31:04.875,"Do you know what a roller pigeon is, Barney?"
01:31:04.917,01:31:10.667,"Roller pigeons climb high and fast, then roll over and fall just as fast towards the earth."
01:31:10.709,01:31:13.917,"There are shallow rollers, and there are deep rollers."
01:31:13.959,01:31:20.250,"But you can't breed two deep rollers, or their young, their offspring, will roll all the way down, hit and die."
01:31:21.166,01:31:23.458,Agent Starling is a deep roller.
01:31:25.250,01:31:28.083,Let's hope one of her parents was not.
01:32:56.083,01:32:58.250,Hello.
01:32:58.291,01:33:00.709,"The power on that battery is low, Clarice."
01:33:00.750,01:33:03.417,"I would have changed it, but I didn't want to wake you."
01:33:03.458,01:33:05.458,"You're gonna have to use the other one, in the charger."
01:33:05.500,01:33:08.333,Hopefully the light on it is green by now.
01:33:08.375,01:33:15.166,"Because this is gonna be a long call, and I can't let you off, because even though you've been stripped of your duties, I know you wouldn't abandon them."
01:33:15.208,01:33:17.125,You'll try to put on a trace.
01:33:17.166,01:33:20.583,So we'll disconnect long enough for you to exchange the battery in the phone...
01:33:20.625,01:33:22.417,for the one in the charger.
01:33:22.458,01:33:25.709,Shall we say...
01:33:25.750,01:33:27.083,Are you ready?
01:33:27.083,01:33:28.166,Go.
01:33:33.875,01:33:35.750,Very good.
01:33:35.792,01:33:38.750,"Remember, Clarice. If you get caught with a concealed, unlicensed firearm..."
01:33:38.792,01:33:41.542,"in the District of Columbia, the penalty's pretty stiff."
01:33:41.583,01:33:43.625,But bring the guns if you have to.
01:33:43.667,01:33:45.166,"Now, get in your car."
01:34:22.375,01:34:28.250,"The reason we're doing it like this, Clarice, is because I like to watch you as we speak, with your eyes open."
01:34:29.125,01:34:31.125,"No, it does not excite me."
01:34:31.166,01:34:33.333,It pleases me.
01:34:33.375,01:34:35.750,You have very shapely feet.
01:34:39.083,01:34:41.500,Where are we now?
01:34:41.542,01:34:45.500,- Massachusetts Avenue.
01:34:45.542,01:34:49.291,"I thought, to begin with, you might tell me how you're feeling."
01:34:49.333,01:34:53.125,- About what?
01:34:53.166,01:34:56.083,"Your career, such as it is."
01:34:56.083,01:34:58.166,"Your life, Clarice."
01:34:58.208,01:35:00.208,I thought we might talk about yours.
01:35:00.250,01:35:03.333,What's the next cross street?
01:35:03.375,01:35:07.500,"In two blocks, make a left into Union Station. Park."
01:35:08.917,01:35:11.375,My life?
01:35:11.417,01:35:14.417,I have been in a state of hibernation for some time.
01:35:14.458,01:35:18.542,"A little inactive, but now I'm back home."
01:35:18.583,01:35:21.750,I'm very happy and very healthy.
01:35:21.792,01:35:25.125,"You, though-- It's you I'm worried about."
01:35:25.166,01:35:27.083,I'm fine.
01:35:27.083,01:35:29.375,"No, you're certainly not fine, Clarice."
01:35:29.417,01:35:37.458,"You fell in love with the Bureau, the institution, only to discover, after giving it everything you've got, that it does not love you back."
01:35:37.500,01:35:39.917,"That, in fact, it resents you."
01:35:39.959,01:35:42.750,Resents you more than the husband and children you gave up to it.
01:35:42.792,01:35:45.375,"Why is that, do you think?"
01:35:45.417,01:35:48.417,"Why are you so resented, Clarice?"
01:35:48.458,01:35:50.542,Tell you?
01:35:50.583,01:35:53.208,God bless you.
01:35:55.500,01:35:58.625,"You serve the idea of order, Clarice."
01:35:58.667,01:36:00.250,They don't.
01:36:00.291,01:36:03.750,You believe you took. They don't.
01:36:03.792,01:36:06.250,You feel it is your duty to protect the sheep.
01:36:06.291,01:36:08.250,- They don't.
01:36:08.291,01:36:10.458,They don't like you because you're not like them.
01:36:10.500,01:36:12.625,"They hate you, and they envy you."
01:36:12.667,01:36:15.083,They're weak and unruly and believe in nothing.
01:36:16.625,01:36:19.500,"Mason Verger wants to kill you, Dr. Lecter."
01:36:19.542,01:36:22.125,"Turn yourself in to me, and I promise no one will hurt you."
01:36:22.166,01:36:25.792,"Will you stay with me in my prison cell and hold my hand, Clarice?"
01:36:25.834,01:36:28.166,We could have some fun.
01:36:28.208,01:36:31.750,"No, Mason Verger does not want to kill me any more than I want to kill him."
01:36:31.792,01:36:35.959,He just wants to see me suffer in some unimaginable way.
01:36:36.083,01:36:37.792,"He is rather twisted, you know."
01:36:37.834,01:36:40.375,Have you had the pleasure of meeting him?
01:36:40.417,01:36:42.792,"Face-to-face, so to speak?"
01:36:42.834,01:36:44.792,Yes.
01:36:44.834,01:36:46.083,"Attractive, isn't he?"
01:36:46.083,01:36:47.792,Dr. Lecter?
01:36:48.792,01:36:50.083,Dr. Lecter?
01:36:52.291,01:36:54.458,"Okay, back to you."
01:36:54.500,01:36:56.625,I want to know what it is you think you will do...
01:36:56.667,01:36:58.500,now that everything in the world you've ever cared about...
01:36:58.542,01:37:00.125,has been taken away from you.
01:37:00.166,01:37:02.709,"I don't know, Dr. Lecter."
01:37:02.750,01:37:04.583,"Tell me, Clarice."
01:37:04.625,01:37:10.583,"Do you think you'll work as a chambermaid at a motel on Route 66, just like your mommy?"
01:37:11.250,01:37:12.583,Huh?
01:37:12.625,01:37:16.500,"May I have your attention, please?"
01:37:20.875,01:37:22.500,What are you thinking now?
01:37:22.542,01:37:26.625,"Are you paying attention to me, ex-Special Agent Starling?"
01:37:26.667,01:37:30.667,"Are you, by any chance, trying to trace my whereabouts?"
01:37:35.166,01:37:38.458,"- I'm being followed, Dr. Lecter."
01:37:38.500,01:37:41.375,"And now you're in a real dilemma, aren't you?"
01:37:41.417,01:37:45.375,"Do you continue to try to find me, knowing that you're leading them to me?"
01:37:45.417,01:37:53.083,"Do you have so much faith in your abilities, Clarice, that you honestly believe you could somehow simultaneously arrest me and them?"
01:37:53.083,01:37:55.208,"It could get very messy, Clarice."
01:37:55.250,01:37:57.083,Like the fish market.
01:37:57.083,01:37:58.583,"Hey, Clarice."
01:37:58.625,01:38:01.208,What if I did it for you?
01:38:01.250,01:38:03.208,"Harmed them, Clarice."
01:38:03.250,01:38:05.166,The ones who have harmed you.
01:38:05.208,01:38:08.250,What if I made them scream apologies?
01:38:08.291,01:38:16.083,"No, I shouldn't even say it, because you'll feel, with your perfect grasp of right and wrong, that you were somehow accompli."
01:38:17.291,01:38:18.875,Don't help me.
01:38:19.875,01:38:21.583,"No, of course not."
01:38:21.625,01:38:23.291,Forget I said it.
01:38:24.083,01:38:26.083,Piero.
01:38:27.542,01:38:30.417,"Clarice, you were very, very warm."
01:38:30.458,01:38:32.542,You were so close.
01:38:36.458,01:38:38.083,But now you're getting colder again.
01:38:39.458,01:38:41.709,"Yeah, warmer again."
01:38:41.750,01:38:45.917,"Well, I think I've been generous enough with you, and the clues."
01:38:45.959,01:38:49.542,"You're on your own now, Clarice."
01:38:58.750,01:39:01.583,"Hope you like them, Clarice."
01:39:10.500,01:39:12.083,Va bene.
01:39:30.583,01:39:32.500,Go.
01:39:35.291,01:39:36.750,Vai! Vai!
01:39:49.125,01:39:50.542,Get out of the way!
01:40:03.041,01:40:07.792,"I know the first thing an hysteric says is, I am not an hysteric, but I am not an hysteric."
01:40:07.834,01:40:09.667,I'm calm.
01:40:09.709,01:40:11.875,I'll ask you one time.
01:40:13.625,01:40:16.792,Think about every good thing you ever did.
01:40:16.834,01:40:18.458,Think about what you swore.
01:40:19.417,01:40:21.083,"Two men in a van, a third driving."
01:40:21.125,01:40:24.625,Another man down.
01:40:24.667,01:40:27.875,"I've given you the license plate, and I'm reporting it all to you again in front of witnesses."
01:40:29.959,01:40:31.875,All right.
01:40:32.750,01:40:34.750,I'll go with it as a kidnapping.
01:40:35.959,01:40:39.792,"I'll send someone out with the local authorities, if he'll let us on the property without a warrant."
01:40:39.834,01:40:42.041,I should go too.
01:40:42.083,01:40:44.291,No. You're not going.
01:40:44.333,01:40:45.500,You're going home...
01:40:45.542,01:40:47.000,where you'll wait for me to call...
01:40:47.041,01:40:49.750,"and tell you what, if anything, we found."
01:40:52.208,01:40:55.542,Thank Mr. Verger for letting us look around.
01:40:55.583,01:40:57.583,Not at all.
01:41:07.125,01:41:09.083,Phone.
01:41:09.083,01:41:11.834,"What number, please?"
01:41:11.875,01:41:13.208,Carlo.
01:41:17.792,01:41:18.917,Piero.
01:41:21.291,01:41:22.792,Give me one.
01:41:26.709,01:41:28.375,Hello?
01:41:28.417,01:41:29.625,"Uh, sleeping."
01:41:29.667,01:41:32.542,Bring him home.
01:41:55.959,01:41:59.375,You've reached Clarice Starling.
01:41:59.417,01:42:02.875,"Pick up, Starling."
01:42:02.917,01:42:05.208,"I'm gonna say it again, in case you didn't hear me clearly before."
01:42:05.250,01:42:08.083,You are not a law officer while you're on suspension.
01:42:08.125,01:42:09.208,You're Joe Blow.
01:42:10.792,01:42:13.417,"I hope, for your sake, you're in the bathroom."
01:42:52.709,01:42:57.875,Hylochoerus meinertzhageni.
01:42:57.917,01:43:01.709,"Ring any bells from high school biology, Doctor?"
01:43:02.917,01:43:04.709,No?
01:43:04.750,01:43:11.166,"Well, I could list its most conspicuous features, if that would help jog the memory."
01:43:12.250,01:43:34.333,"Three pairs of incisors, one pair of elongated canines, three pairs of molars, four pairs of pre-molars, upper and lower, for a total of 44 teeth."
01:43:39.083,01:43:44.250,The meal will begin with an hors d'oeuvre tartare.
01:43:45.583,01:43:48.417,Your feet.
01:43:48.458,01:43:54.333,"The main course, the rest of you, won't be served until seven hours later."
01:43:54.375,01:43:56.583,But during that time...
01:43:56.625,01:44:01.667,you'll be able to enjoy the effects of the consumed appetizer...
01:44:01.709,01:44:04.709,with a full-bodied saline drip.
01:44:06.458,01:44:12.417,I guess you wish now you'd-- you'd fed the rest of me to the dogs.
01:44:12.458,01:44:15.125,Hmm?
01:44:16.750,01:44:19.083,"No, I much prefer you the way you are."
01:44:20.291,01:44:21.834,So...
01:44:23.083,01:44:25.125,dinner at 8:00.
01:44:53.333,01:44:58.458,"You will stay for the evening's entertainment, won't you, Cordell?"
01:44:58.500,01:45:03.166,"If it's all right with you, I think I'd rather not."
01:45:04.208,01:45:06.291,Rather not...
01:45:06.333,01:45:08.166,or will not?
01:47:12.834,01:47:17.125,Your little brother must smell almost as badly as you do by now.
01:47:45.083,01:47:47.166,Hold it!
01:47:48.625,01:47:50.709,Bella ragazza.
01:47:50.750,01:47:53.458,- Quiet!
01:47:53.500,01:47:54.917,- Sì.
01:47:58.875,01:48:01.333,What was that?
01:48:01.375,01:48:02.792,"Cordell, quickly!"
01:48:02.834,01:48:04.333,Down on your stomach!
01:48:05.959,01:48:07.667,"Good evening, Clarice."
01:48:07.709,01:48:10.625,Just like old times.
01:48:12.583,01:48:14.917,Can you walk?
01:48:18.583,01:48:21.792,You look well.
01:48:21.834,01:48:25.083,"If you touch me, I'll shoot you."
01:48:25.083,01:48:28.166,Understood.
01:48:28.208,01:48:31.208,Spoken like a true Protestant.
01:48:31.250,01:48:33.792,This might go faster if you hand me the knife.
01:48:33.834,01:48:36.083,There was a third in the loft.
01:48:36.125,01:48:39.917,"No, Clarice."
01:49:17.625,01:49:19.709,Cordell!
01:49:19.750,01:49:21.208,Get the gun and shoot him!
01:49:21.250,01:49:23.917,Go into the pen?
01:49:23.959,01:49:26.250,No. I'm staying out of this.
01:49:26.291,01:49:29.417,"You're involved is what you are, in all of it."
01:49:29.458,01:49:30.417,"Now, do it!"
01:49:30.458,01:49:31.500,No.
01:49:31.542,01:49:34.667,"Hey, Cordell!"
01:49:34.709,01:49:36.667,You can always say it was me.
01:49:43.166,01:49:47.125,Cordell?
01:49:47.834,01:49:49.125,Cordell!
01:49:49.750,01:49:51.208,Cordell!
01:51:23.375,01:51:24.959,"Yeah, Mary, it's me."
01:51:25.083,01:51:28.542,I decided to take off early.
01:51:28.583,01:51:31.333,"I don't want any calls forwarded either, you understand?"
01:51:31.375,01:51:33.583,"Whoever it is, they can all wait, okay?"
01:51:33.625,01:51:36.792,"Mary, listen to me."
01:51:36.834,01:51:38.375,Thank you.
01:51:53.917,01:51:55.625,What the fuck?
01:52:06.083,01:52:07.208,Good.
01:52:07.250,01:52:09.375,"Oh, God!"
01:53:30.583,01:53:34.333,One time I bet a friend I could hold a lit firecracker in my hand...
01:53:34.375,01:53:36.792,longer than he could.
01:53:36.834,01:53:38.166,Can I guess?
01:53:38.208,01:53:41.375,"You lost the bet, and he lost a finger."
01:53:41.417,01:53:42.959,No.
01:53:43.083,01:53:45.500,This won't hurt a bit.
01:53:51.291,01:53:54.083,Are we expecting guests?
01:53:54.125,01:53:59.750,"You see, dinner appeals to taste and smell, the oldest senses of the mind."
01:53:59.792,01:54:03.542,They precede almost every human emotion.
01:54:26.208,01:54:30.834,"call, and units will be there in about 10 minutes."
01:54:30.875,01:54:34.333,"If you can do it safely, then just get out of the house."
01:54:34.375,01:54:37.291,"Otherwise, stay on the phone with me."
01:54:37.333,01:54:39.959,Ma'am?
01:54:41.208,01:54:42.750,Ma'am?
01:54:58.125,01:55:00.083,You need to make sure they feel welcome.
01:55:05.458,01:55:08.208,Are those shallots?
01:55:08.250,01:55:10.375,And caper berries.
01:55:12.500,01:55:14.083,That butter smells wonderful.
01:55:15.542,01:55:18.959,"- You feeling hungry, Paul?"
01:55:24.959,01:55:29.166,- What's the main course?
01:55:29.208,01:55:30.792,It spoils the surprise.
01:55:31.750,01:55:33.375,"Clarice, what are you doing up?"
01:55:33.417,01:55:35.750,You should be resting.
01:55:36.458,01:55:37.959,I'm hungry.
01:55:40.458,01:55:43.333,"Hello, Paul."
01:55:44.583,01:55:47.500,"Say, Hello, Agent Starling."
01:55:47.542,01:55:50.917,"Hello, Agent Starling."
01:55:53.166,01:55:54.834,I always wanted to watch you eat.
01:55:54.875,01:55:58.291,"What have you got in your hand, Clarice?"
01:55:58.333,01:55:59.917,Something to bash me over the head with?
01:56:00.875,01:56:02.709,Put it on the table.
01:56:03.333,01:56:04.834,Good girl.
01:56:04.875,01:56:07.083,"Hey, that's mine."
01:56:07.083,01:56:08.959,"Now, sit down."
01:56:11.458,01:56:14.083,"Clarice, love the dress."
01:56:14.542,01:56:16.291,It's beautiful.
01:56:16.333,01:56:20.333,"- What do you think, Paul?"
01:56:20.375,01:56:21.458,Yeah.
01:56:29.792,01:56:32.834,"Why don't you say grace, Paul?"
01:56:33.375,01:56:35.500,Me?
01:56:35.542,01:56:37.417,Grace?
01:56:38.375,01:56:40.083,Okay.
01:56:40.125,01:56:42.125,Bow your head.
01:56:44.709,01:56:47.375,"Father, we thank thee for thy blessings..."
01:56:47.417,01:56:50.083,and d-dedicate them to thy m-mercy.
01:56:50.083,01:56:59.625,"We are about... to receive-- Forgive us all, even white trash like Starling here, and bring her into my service, amen."
01:57:02.208,01:57:06.500,"You know, I have to tell you, Paul, even the Apostle Paul couldn't have done better."
01:57:06.542,01:57:08.208,He hated women too.
01:57:08.250,01:57:10.083,"May I have some wine, please?"
01:57:10.125,01:57:13.542,"I don't think that's a good idea, Clarice."
01:57:13.583,01:57:15.959,Better you should eat some broth.
01:57:16.083,01:57:20.792,"By the way, Starling, that was a job offering I worked into the blessing."
01:57:21.583,01:57:23.166,"I'm going to Congress, you know."
01:57:23.208,01:57:25.250,Are you?
01:57:25.291,01:57:27.500,Come around campaign headquarters.
01:57:27.542,01:57:30.125,You could be a office girl.
01:57:30.166,01:57:34.083,Can you type and file?
01:57:34.083,01:57:39.083,Take this down.
01:57:42.125,01:57:44.792,I-I-I took it down.
01:57:44.834,01:57:47.083,"Paul, now you're being rude."
01:57:48.291,01:57:51.625,Drink your broth like a good boy.
01:57:57.792,01:57:59.667,"It's not very good, buddy."
01:57:59.709,01:58:01.917,I admit I added something to yours.
01:58:01.959,01:58:03.834,Perhaps it's clashing with the cumin.
01:58:03.875,01:58:07.083,"But I assure you, the next course is to die for."
01:58:16.542,01:58:19.125,"Ah, ah, ah."
01:58:19.166,01:58:21.250,"Come on, Clarice."
01:58:21.291,01:58:23.250,That's a good girl.
01:58:23.291,01:58:25.500,Good.
01:58:55.625,01:58:57.375,Dr. Lecter.
01:58:57.417,01:59:01.625,"You see, the brain itself feels no pain, Clarice, if that concerns you."
01:59:01.667,01:59:10.458,"For example, Paul won't miss this little piece here, which is the, uh, part of the prefrontal lobe, which they say is the seat of good manners."
01:59:10.500,01:59:14.375,Your profile at the border stations has five features.
01:59:14.417,01:59:16.500,I'll trade you.
01:59:16.542,01:59:18.667,"Stop now, and I'll tell you what they are."
01:59:18.709,01:59:21.083,"How does that word taste to you, Clarice? Hmm?"
01:59:21.083,01:59:24.500,Cheap and metallic like...
01:59:24.542,01:59:27.208,- Who's Clarice?
01:59:27.250,01:59:30.625,"If you can't keep up with the conversation, you better not try to join in at all."
01:59:30.667,01:59:32.875,"Me, Paul."
01:59:32.917,01:59:34.875,See.
01:59:34.917,01:59:38.500,Here. Right here is the...
01:59:38.542,01:59:40.792,sac that contains the brain.
01:59:43.083,01:59:45.709,I would really like some w-wine!
01:59:49.458,01:59:53.125,- That smells great.
01:59:53.166,01:59:55.291,- Like to try a little piece?
01:59:55.333,01:59:57.583,I would really like some wine.
01:59:59.417,02:00:01.500,It is good.
02:00:01.542,02:00:03.458,All right.
02:00:03.500,02:00:05.917,Just a little.
02:00:07.375,02:00:08.375,Okay?
02:00:08.417,02:00:10.959,Mm.
02:00:26.000,02:00:28.750,"Given the chance, you would deny me my life, wouldn't you?"
02:00:29.625,02:00:31.792,"Mmm, not your life."
02:00:31.834,02:00:35.041,My freedom. Just that.
02:00:35.083,02:00:38.417,"And if you did, would they have you back, do you think?"
02:00:38.458,02:00:41.083,The F.B.I.?
02:00:41.125,02:00:44.417,Those people you despise almost as much as they despise you?
02:00:44.458,02:00:48.083,"Would they give you a medal, Clarice, do you think?"
02:00:48.125,02:00:50.458,Would you have it professionally framed and hang it on your wall...
02:00:50.500,02:00:55.166,to look at and remind you of your courage and... incorruptibility?
02:00:58.417,02:01:01.792,"All you would need for that, Clarice, is a mirror."
02:01:03.291,02:01:08.250,"I had plans for that smart mouth, but I'm never gonna hire her-- you now."
02:01:08.291,02:01:09.792,Paul?
02:01:11.542,02:01:13.250,Paul?
02:01:13.291,02:01:14.750,Remember what I said.
02:01:14.792,02:01:20.667,"If you can't be polite to our guests, you have to sit at the kiddies' table."
02:01:21.667,02:01:24.083,"Don't get up, Clarice."
02:01:24.125,02:01:28.375,Paul will help me clear and make the coffee.
02:01:30.083,02:01:32.667,"Just think about what I said, Clarice."
02:01:33.959,02:01:35.667,Coffee.
02:02:05.333,02:02:06.959,Uh-uh.
02:02:13.625,02:02:18.166,"I came halfway around the world to watch you run, Clarice."
02:02:20.959,02:02:24.750,"Let me run, huh?"
02:02:41.917,02:02:43.500,"Tell me, Clarice."
02:02:45.083,02:02:48.125,"Would you ever say to me, Stop?"
02:02:48.166,02:02:50.166,"If you love me, you'd stop?"
02:02:52.083,02:02:54.166,Not in a thousand years.
02:02:55.750,02:02:57.750,Not in a thousand years.
02:03:03.542,02:03:05.750,That's my girl.
02:03:19.208,02:03:23.083,"Now, that's really interesting, Clarice."
02:03:23.083,02:03:26.291,"And I'm really pressed for time, so where's the key?"
02:03:28.959,02:03:31.375,Where's the key?
02:03:36.458,02:03:38.083,Okay.
02:03:43.208,02:03:46.250,Above or below the wrist?
02:03:46.291,02:03:47.959,Clarice?
02:03:55.291,02:03:56.959,This is really going to hurt.
02:04:46.959,02:04:49.333,Show me your hands!
02:04:50.083,02:04:51.500,Identify yourself!
02:04:52.875,02:04:54.333,I'm Clarice Starling!
02:04:55.458,02:04:57.166,F.B.I.!
02:05:56.333,02:05:58.291,Hi.
02:05:58.333,02:06:00.083,What's that?
02:06:01.834,02:06:04.083,"Oh, that's caviar."
02:06:04.083,02:06:07.333,What are those?
02:06:08.375,02:06:09.458,And that?
02:06:11.083,02:06:13.083,And this?
02:06:14.125,02:06:17.083,That I don't think you would like.
02:06:17.083,02:06:19.625,It looks good.
02:06:19.667,02:06:20.959,Can I have some?
02:06:22.583,02:06:25.083,"You're a very unusual boy, aren't you?"
02:06:25.125,02:06:28.083,I couldn't eat what they gave me.
02:06:28.083,02:06:32.417,"It isn't even food as I understand the definition, which is why I always bring my own."
02:06:32.458,02:06:34.125,Hmm.
02:06:35.083,02:06:37.166,So which would you like to try?
02:06:39.500,02:06:43.625,"Ah. Well, I suppose it's all right."
02:06:46.083,02:06:47.959,"After all, as your mother tells you..."
02:06:48.083,02:06:56.333,"and my mother certainly told me, it is important, she always used to say, always to try new things."
02:06:56.375,02:06:57.667,Open up.
02:11:13.458,02:11:15.083,Ta-ta.
02:11:15.083,02:11:16.583,H..
