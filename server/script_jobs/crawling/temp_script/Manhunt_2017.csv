00:00:23.398,00:00:32.073,"Stop taking it for granted like some complacent, sleepwalking sheep and really think about it."
00:00:32.115,00:00:39.999,"I promise you, you will find the U.S. mail a worthy object of your contemplation."
00:00:44.712,00:00:49.090,A piece of paper can cross a continent like we're passing notes in class.
00:00:49.132,00:00:59.768,"I can send you cookies from the opposite side of the world, and all I have to do is write your name on the box, put some stamps on it, and drop it in."
00:01:02.855,00:01:11.446,"And, you see, it only works because every single person along the chain acts like a mindless automaton."
00:01:11.488,00:01:16.117,"I write an address, and they just... obey."
00:01:16.159,00:01:18.203,No question.
00:01:18.245,00:01:21.373,No deviation.
00:01:21.415,00:01:25.126,No pause to contemplate eternity...
00:01:25.168,00:01:27.295,or beauty...
00:01:28.923,00:01:30.131,or death.
00:01:31.592,00:01:40.267,"Even you, for all your protestations of free will, if a box comes with your name on it, you can't even imagine doing anything other..."
00:01:40.308,00:01:42.143,than obey.
00:01:42.185,00:01:44.271,Morning.
00:01:44.855,00:01:45.898,Here you go.
00:01:46.147,00:01:47.942,Thank you.
00:01:49.192,00:01:51.528,"Well, it's not your fault."
00:01:51.570,00:01:53.948,Society made you this way.
00:01:54.907,00:02:00.370,"But you're a sheep, and you're living in a world of sheep."
00:02:00.412,00:02:12.716,"And because you're all sheep, because all you can do is obey, I can reach out and touch anyone anywhere."
00:02:13.592,00:02:18.889,I can reach out and touch you...
00:02:18.931,00:02:21.100,right now.
00:03:52.691,00:03:54.359,This is private property.
00:04:00.323,00:04:02.242,"Hey, Fitz."
00:04:02.826,00:04:05.245,Come on.
00:04:16.339,00:04:20.635,you are now officially FBI profilers.
00:04:26.058,00:04:30.979,"As profilers, you're going to encounter a lot of skepticism."
00:04:31.021,00:04:36.317,"A lot of agents, good agents, think us quacks."
00:04:36.359,00:04:37.778,No.
00:04:37.819,00:04:40.405,We're pioneers in the frontier of law enforcement.
00:04:40.447,00:04:52.333,"We're scientists of the mind, and, in the very worst cases, the FBI deals with, we will be our nation's last hope."
00:04:52.375,00:04:55.254,Welcome to the Behavioral Analysis Unit.
00:04:58.132,00:05:01.342,Supervisory Special Agent Jessica McGinity.
00:05:01.384,00:05:02.343,Wonderful work.
00:05:04.387,00:05:06.347,Thank you.
00:05:06.389,00:05:11.770,"With accommodation for superior merit, Supervisory Special Agent James Fitzgerald."
00:05:13.563,00:05:15.023,"Congratulations, Fitz."
00:05:15.065,00:05:18.485,-Congratulations.
00:05:18.526,00:05:20.904,-Dad!
00:05:33.959,00:05:36.544,"Dad, come on!"
00:05:36.586,00:05:38.337,"-Come on, Dad. Come on."
00:05:38.379,00:05:41.424,-Mom's gonna give us speech.
00:05:41.466,00:05:45.137,-Come on!
00:05:48.932,00:05:53.478,Okay.
00:05:53.520,00:06:01.569,Can you believe we're even here celebrating my husband the FBI profiler?
00:06:01.611,00:06:03.404,I'm still pinching myself.
00:06:05.448,00:06:08.576,You were a rookie beat cop when we got married.
00:06:11.412,00:06:29.388,"Jim, you were determined always to become what you saw as the best version of yourself, to become someone that your family, your sons could look up to and admire."
00:06:30.265,00:06:33.434,It's not easy being married to a stubborn man.
00:06:35.478,00:06:37.480,I'm talking about you.
00:06:37.522,00:06:48.783,"But it's that damned stubbornness that got you through night school, on to the detective squad, into Quantico, and finally into the elite of the elite."
00:06:48.825,00:06:54.413,"I admire that so, so much, so cheers, Jim."
00:06:54.455,00:06:55.165,Welcome home.
00:07:02.714,00:07:04.799,Did you have fun?
00:07:04.841,00:07:06.676,You know I'm not great in crowds.
00:07:08.511,00:07:11.681,"cares? Dan, clean up down there!"
00:07:11.723,00:07:13.683,"Listen, it was amazing."
00:07:13.725,00:07:16.353,-Thank you.
00:07:16.395,00:07:17.520,"Look, I tried."
00:07:17.562,00:07:19.981,Thank you.
00:07:20.023,00:07:22.109,"Well, you know, I-I..."
00:07:22.150,00:07:24.736,What?
00:07:24.778,00:07:25.820,I had fun.
00:07:25.862,00:07:29.574,It's just hard waiting.
00:07:29.616,00:07:31.701,"-Oh, yeah."
00:07:31.743,00:07:34.371,"No, I-I got soapy hands."
00:07:34.413,00:07:36.831,Put 'em on me.
00:07:38.375,00:07:40.501,bald guys at the door!
00:07:41.711,00:07:42.921,Put 'em up!
00:07:45.048,00:07:46.383,-Hey.
00:07:46.425,00:07:47.926,-Guess we missed the party.
00:07:47.968,00:07:49.177,"No, no, we're just-- We're just cleaning up."
00:07:49.219,00:07:51.096,-Dan.
00:07:51.138,00:07:53.014,"-Ugh, you got to change him."
00:07:53.056,00:07:55.183,"Yeah, all right."
00:07:55.225,00:07:57.060,"Apologies, but..."
00:07:57.102,00:07:58.561,It's all right.
00:07:58.603,00:08:00.521,...we have something urgent we need to discuss with you.
00:08:03.566,00:08:05.277,Right.
00:08:06.569,00:08:08.363,"Yeah, come in."
00:08:10.240,00:08:12.951,McAlpine says you're the best profiler in his class.
00:08:12.993,00:08:14.702,Maybe the best he's got.
00:08:14.744,00:08:25.505,"But you're 10 years older than the rest of your classmates, and I look at your résumé, and I see you languishing for almost a decade as a beat cop, mostly on the graffiti squad."
00:08:25.546,00:08:28.091,You piss somebody off?
00:08:29.634,00:08:33.013,No.
00:08:33.054,00:08:36.808,"Mm. Chief asked me to make it go away 'cause it was for a friend of a friend, and I didn't."
00:08:36.850,00:08:39.769,"So, what, you're like the Serpico of parking tickets?"
00:08:39.811,00:08:41.938,Some people would call that being overly literal.
00:08:41.980,00:08:43.731,"Yeah, some people might."
00:08:45.608,00:08:46.943,Take a look at this letter.
00:08:46.985,00:08:49.404,Tell me what you see.
00:08:56.703,00:08:59.080,You're making fun of me.
00:08:59.122,00:09:00.457,"You're making fun of me, right?"
00:09:00.499,00:09:02.750,Right?
00:09:02.792,00:09:04.002,How many times do I have to tell you?
00:09:04.044,00:09:05.586,You talking about the emordnilap?
00:09:05.628,00:09:07.172,"Dad, it is I?"
00:09:07.214,00:09:10.008,Explain.
00:09:10.050,00:09:12.386,"Well, it's a word thing."
00:09:12.427,00:09:16.181,"It's like a palindrome, except it spells one thing forwards and another thing backwards."
00:09:16.223,00:09:24.647,"The first letter of each paragraph-- D, A, D, I, T, I, S, I."
00:09:24.689,00:09:26.607,Okay.
00:09:26.649,00:09:31.112,"D, A, D, I, T, I, S, I-- Dad, it is I."
00:09:31.154,00:09:35.700,"D-A-D, I-T, right?"
00:09:35.742,00:09:45.377,"D-A-D, I-T, I-S I-- Dad, it is I, Is it I, Dad?"
00:09:45.419,00:09:46.920,"It's pretty cool, right?"
00:09:46.961,00:09:50.215,I'm Andy Genelli. I'm head of the Unabom Task Force.
00:09:53.134,00:09:57.638,I thought the-- I thought the Unabom case was over.
00:09:57.680,00:09:59.182,Six years and not a peep.
00:09:59.224,00:10:02.602,"They thought he was dead, but now he's back."
00:10:03.562,00:10:07.399,"Three new mail bombs, more deadly than before."
00:10:07.441,00:10:11.652,"The latest one yesterday-- a timber lobbyist, Sacramento."
00:10:11.694,00:10:14.364,The news is gonna break on these tomorrow.
00:10:14.406,00:10:17.492,"We've been playing it pretty close to the vest until we were sure it was him, and not a..."
00:10:17.534,00:10:21.037,-Hey. Okay.
00:10:17.534,00:10:22.663,"-...copycat, but it's him, and we need a profile."
00:10:22.705,00:10:24.791,Okay.
00:10:24.832,00:10:27.043,"Now, what are you doing to me?"
00:10:27.085,00:10:30.088,-I have kids.
00:10:30.130,00:10:31.923,It's one month.
00:10:31.965,00:10:39.598,"You go out there, build a profile, and come back to the B.A.U."
00:10:43.268,00:10:45.479,"This here-- This is from him, from the Unabomber?"
00:10:45.520,00:10:47.355,His most recent letter.
00:10:47.397,00:10:52.026,50 FBI agents have been going over that with a fine-tooth comb day and night for two weeks.
00:10:52.068,00:10:55.696,"Not one of them saw the emordnilap, not even me."
00:10:55.738,00:11:00.701,"I've had profilers working on this thing for 15 years, and we're right back to where we started."
00:11:00.743,00:11:05.457,"I need somebody that sees things differently, and like it or not, that's you."
00:11:08.876,00:11:11.921,"But I've been away for four months, and I just got back."
00:11:11.963,00:11:14.257,"I can't just up and go 'cause of him, so..."
00:11:14.299,00:11:17.302,to Ellie and the kids.
00:11:17.344,00:11:18.719,I can't do that to my family.
00:11:18.761,00:11:21.598,Here. Good luck.
00:11:21.640,00:11:22.890,"to intrude, Mr. Fitzgerald."
00:11:22.932,00:11:24.518,"-Do me a favor, Fitz."
00:11:24.559,00:11:26.727,"Fitz, think about it."
00:11:26.769,00:11:28.480,Keep the photos.
00:11:28.522,00:11:33.692,"The guy with his face blown off, he had a wife and kids, too."
00:11:35.362,00:11:38.448,see you first.
00:11:38.490,00:11:40.699,Thank you.
00:11:50.043,00:11:51.503,from Grandma?
00:11:51.545,00:11:53.588,my cookies from Grandma.
00:11:53.630,00:11:55.965,They're mine.
00:11:57.676,00:12:01.762,"Go, go."
00:12:01.804,00:12:03.223,"Hi, guys."
00:12:03.264,00:12:04.974,You need to share!
00:12:03.264,00:12:06.767,You're always so-- I'm definitely not sharing.
00:12:06.809,00:12:09.521,"Sorry, buddy, 'cause Grandma made these cookies just for me."
00:12:09.563,00:12:11.147,"Yeah, but you need to share."
00:12:11.189,00:12:12.773,"No, I'm not gonna share."
00:12:21.616,00:12:23.784,These are my cookies.
00:12:23.826,00:12:26.621,Don't pig out on Grandma's cookies.
00:12:28.831,00:12:31.918,You can't have any.
00:13:06.827,00:13:11.541,"living like an animal now, huh?"
00:13:13.752,00:13:15.169,You kill those yourself?
00:13:15.211,00:13:17.130,"in my house, Cole?"
00:13:17.171,00:13:21.092,"Well, I don't want to be here, believe me."
00:13:21.134,00:13:23.344,But the boss needs you.
00:13:23.386,00:13:30.268,"We need you to get into a room with Kaczynski, interrogate him, break him down, get him to plead guilty."
00:13:30.310,00:13:38.192,"We need someone who can speak the Unabomber's language, someone, uh, that he connects with."
00:13:40.654,00:13:45.700,"Besides, Ted asked for you."
00:13:53.667,00:13:57.587,The Unabomber asked for me specifically?
00:13:57.629,00:14:01.257,"Specifically for you, and only you."
00:14:01.299,00:14:03.009,Why me?
00:14:03.050,00:14:06.971,"He says he'll only talk to the person who actually caught him, and for some reason, he thinks that's you."
00:14:07.013,00:14:08.348,"Well, that is me."
00:14:08.389,00:14:09.890,You were chasing your tails for years before I came.
00:14:09.932,00:14:12.686,This guy-- You got some nerve.
00:14:12.727,00:14:15.689,"I found him, I caught him, I put him in jail."
00:14:15.730,00:14:17.357,You know what?
00:14:17.398,00:14:19.567,I'm just gonna stay right here.
00:14:19.609,00:14:27.867,"Listen, we have enough evidence to convict Ted Kaczynski 10 times over, but if this goes to trial, he's gonna make it a media circus."
00:14:27.908,00:14:36.042,"Then we would be giving the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski, the biggest microphone in America, and his message is dangerous."
00:14:36.083,00:14:37.918,We need him to plead guilty.
00:14:37.960,00:14:40.296,"Look, Fitz, we're asking you, but we can order you if we need to."
00:14:40.338,00:14:41.840,You can order me.
00:14:41.881,00:14:43.132,"You still work for the FBI, you remember that?"
00:14:43.174,00:14:44.217,"Now, hold on, Cole."
00:14:44.258,00:14:47.637,"I get the forestry service out here-- -Take it down, Cole!"
00:14:47.679,00:14:50.849,Get out of here.
00:14:50.890,00:14:52.559,"Hey, Fitz."
00:14:55.061,00:14:56.646,Think about it.
00:16:14.014,00:16:17.017,Fitz!
00:16:22.106,00:16:24.692,You have that new-profiler smell.
00:16:24.734,00:16:25.693,Tabby Milgrim.
00:16:25.735,00:16:26.903,I'm your new partner.
00:16:26.945,00:16:29.238,"Well, I'm the UTF's whole behavioral unit."
00:16:29.280,00:16:32.032,Come on. Let's get you out of this craziness.
00:16:32.074,00:16:34.911,PB today. Sorry.
00:16:34.953,00:16:37.204,"Night school in psych sucks, but..."
00:16:37.246,00:16:42.961,"Plus, U San Raffaele is about a fart and a half away from losing its accreditation, but whatever."
00:16:43.002,00:16:47.047,"As long as I squeak out a master's before they go under, -we're all good."
00:16:47.089,00:16:48.090,You trained at the B.A.U.?
00:16:48.132,00:16:49.884,"Hell no, bruh."
00:16:49.926,00:16:51.761,I'm just a street agent.
00:17:00.561,00:17:03.105,a big op before?
00:17:03.147,00:17:07.819,"Some big bank robberies, and a D.A. homicide task force in Philly had, like, 20 full-time agents."
00:17:07.861,00:17:09.069,"It was pretty huge, pretty intense."
00:17:09.111,00:17:13.574,"Hmm. Well, welcome to the Unabom Task Force."
00:17:13.825,00:17:15.535,Whoa.
00:17:30.800,00:17:33.093,"Fresh meat, you're with me."
00:17:34.345,00:17:37.056,Come on-- Briefing's about to start.
00:17:39.017,00:17:40.518,All right.
00:17:40.560,00:17:43.229,I'm gonna rip the Band-Aid off quick.
00:17:43.270,00:17:52.989,"Most of you are TDY'd here for 60 days-- Want to get you on the playing field, except, of course, for Tabby who's been here for two years and somehow still shows up late."
00:17:53.031,00:17:58.870,We are hunting the deadliest serial bomber in history-- the Unabomber.
00:17:58.912,00:18:09.923,"For 17 years, he's been planting and mailing bombs, 16 bombs, three people killed, dozens injured, and we really have no friggin' clue who he is or why he's doing this."
00:18:09.964,00:18:18.681,"We call him the Unabomber because his early targets were universities and airlines-- UN for university, A for airline, Unabom."
00:18:18.723,00:18:21.267,He calls himself FC for Freedom Club.
00:18:21.308,00:18:23.561,It's how he signs all his letters.
00:18:23.603,00:18:25.772,It's also how he signs his bombs.
00:18:25.813,00:18:29.525,17 years of bombs all signed by FC.
00:18:29.567,00:18:30.985,He's a sick bastard.
00:18:31.027,00:18:35.155,"Northwestern, 1978, another one there in '79."
00:18:35.197,00:18:39.994,November '79-- nearly takes out American Airlines Flight 444.
00:18:40.036,00:18:45.165,The bomb was sent via air mail rigged with an altimeter-- 22 passengers injured.
00:18:45.207,00:18:49.587,"1980, United Airlines president gets his face blown in."
00:18:49.629,00:19:01.099,"More university bombs, '81, '82-- computer science professors, engineering professors, one poor secretary at Vanderbilt opened a package addressed to her boss."
00:19:01.140,00:19:10.900,"More universities in '82, '85, '85, Boeing in '85, two computer shops, '85 and '87."
00:19:10.942,00:19:14.779,"The second one, he got his first fatality."
00:19:14.821,00:19:19.199,And this is where we got our first eyewitness.
00:19:19.241,00:19:24.956,"She gave us this now-famous sketch, and then nothing for six years."
00:19:24.998,00:19:29.127,So we figured he was dead or maybe finally got laid.
00:19:30.461,00:19:34.757,"But then he is back-- Epstein at U.C., Gelernter at Yale."
00:19:34.799,00:19:40.138,"In his hiatus, he developed much more powerful and sophisticated bombs, and they keep coming."
00:19:40.179,00:19:45.893,"Exxon Valdez's PR guy, Mosser, and just last week, Gil Murray in Sacramento."
00:19:45.935,00:19:49.188,It took three body bags to collect the parts.
00:19:51.107,00:19:55.153,Why these targets?
00:19:55.194,00:19:57.237,"So, what forensic leads do we have?"
00:19:57.279,00:20:00.574,"Basically, we have no forensic leads."
00:20:00.616,00:20:02.702,"No DNA, no prints."
00:20:02.743,00:20:04.244,But we did have a couple good ideas.
00:20:04.286,00:20:13.921,"We discovered that he gets his addresses out of one particular edition of Who's Who, so we interviewed just about every librarian in the country-- nothing."
00:20:13.963,00:20:19.677,"Makes his bombs out of junk, so we did a national junkyard canvass-- no dice."
00:20:19.719,00:20:23.263,"But we figure eventually he is gonna screw up, and maybe he already did."
00:20:23.305,00:20:30.813,"Over the years, he's been mailing typed letters-- nothing worth reading until this letter that he wrote to The New York Times."
00:20:30.855,00:20:37.195,"Now, the letter itself is blah-blah-blah, but forensics found this on the envelope-- Call Nathan R."
00:20:37.236,00:20:40.406,We figure he wrote himself a Post-it note on top of the letter.
00:20:40.447,00:20:43.117,And that is our first real lead.
00:20:43.159,00:20:47.287,FBI agents are interviewing everyone called Nathan R-something in the country.
00:20:47.329,00:20:51.291,Plan B is to find Nathans with R middle names.
00:20:51.333,00:20:52.960,"10,000 Nathan R's."
00:20:53.002,00:20:57.297,And that is it.
00:20:57.339,00:21:00.968,Don't forget to tip your driver.
00:21:01.010,00:21:03.179,It's not much to go on.
00:21:03.221,00:21:04.304,Nope.
00:21:04.346,00:21:05.806,This is why they need us.
00:21:05.848,00:21:09.309,The profile is gonna focus the entire search.
00:21:09.351,00:21:11.270,It's a big responsibility.
00:21:11.311,00:21:13.940,It's exciting.
00:21:13.981,00:21:15.775,Mildly.
00:21:15.816,00:21:18.986,S.A.C. Ackerman wants to meet you.
00:21:20.362,00:21:21.906,I feel privileged to be under your command.
00:21:21.948,00:21:26.035,"I studied your cases at the Academy-- the Russian river killer, Hartford abduction."
00:21:26.077,00:21:33.626,"Under any other agent, that would have ended in a murder-suicide, and, Agent Cole, Ohio Seven sting, busting the Bad Axe Militia."
00:21:33.667,00:21:36.003,I can't believe I'm standing here.
00:21:36.045,00:21:38.131,I am-- I'm eager to learn from you both.
00:21:38.172,00:21:39.799,"Well, I love this guy already."
00:21:39.840,00:21:45.221,"So, Fitz, we sent Genelli to bring back the best man he could find, and that is you."
00:21:45.263,00:21:46.472,Welcome aboard.
00:21:46.513,00:21:50.309,And here is what you're gonna be working on.
00:21:52.728,00:21:55.606,employed by an airline.
00:21:55.648,00:22:05.324,"Mechanic or technician, no higher education, possibly little to no high school, grew up in Ohio-- Cleveland or Cincinnati likely-- currently resides in the Bay Area."
00:22:06.700,00:22:08.244,"So, what is this?"
00:22:08.286,00:22:12.832,"It's our current profile, my own summary of it."
00:22:12.873,00:22:13.749,Where's the rest of it?
00:22:13.791,00:22:15.375,That's exactly why you're here.
00:22:15.417,00:22:18.378,"I want you to take that, flesh it out."
00:22:18.420,00:22:23.092,I'm gonna need 15 pages that can directly on Attorney General Janet Reno's desk.
00:22:23.134,00:22:25.427,So make us look good.
00:22:26.804,00:22:29.389,"Yeah, I will. I will."
00:22:29.431,00:22:35.021,"It's just a little different than I'm used to, 'cause in terms of a profile, they were a lot more scientific and a little bit longer."
00:22:35.062,00:22:36.605,Welcome to the real world.
00:22:36.647,00:22:39.025,Quantico's a long way away.
00:22:39.066,00:22:50.119,"is that that summary is a distillation of 10 years' work, so it's got a solid foundation, and we don't expect it to change, except for the wood thing."
00:22:50.161,00:22:52.830,Mm.
00:22:52.872,00:22:55.415,There's a theory FC is obsessed with wood.
00:22:55.457,00:22:58.418,Maybe he has erectile dysfunction.
00:22:58.460,00:23:04.508,"Since he blew up this Mosser guy-- moss-- It's like a plant, so that can go in your profile now."
00:23:04.550,00:23:15.393,"very, very well with the press, so I want you to dress that up a bit, uh, a propensity for softness in the genital region, something like that-- but nothing crude."
00:23:17.688,00:23:21.150,I can definitely do something.
00:23:21.192,00:23:22.735,I was expecting a support team.
00:23:22.776,00:23:24.945,Nope.
00:23:24.987,00:23:26.655,But I know you can handle it.
00:23:26.697,00:23:28.908,Okay.
00:23:28.949,00:23:39.919,"no typos, and wood, a lot of bullet points, a lot of big words, a couple weeks, get it turned in, get you back home."
00:23:39.960,00:23:43.463,"If you want to hear some war stories, come out for a beer tomorrow."
00:23:43.505,00:23:46.424,We're going to Freddy's-- old-school San Francisco.
00:23:46.466,00:23:47.425,You'll like it.
00:23:47.467,00:23:48.886,-Sure.
00:24:26.757,00:24:28.508,I just don't see it.
00:24:28.550,00:24:30.468,I just don't see the wood thing.
00:24:32.221,00:24:36.934,They want me to do a thing about FC's erectile dysfunction.
00:24:36.976,00:24:38.685,What is it with men and their dongs?
00:24:38.727,00:24:39.979,You should write it.
00:24:40.020,00:24:43.316,Write that report-- You'll be on CNN tonight.
00:24:43.565,00:24:47.111,It's B.S.
00:24:47.153,00:24:50.072,This profile-- This profile is B.S.
00:24:51.991,00:24:53.533,I think it's got to go.
00:24:53.575,00:24:54.868,Let's just start over.
00:24:54.910,00:24:57.079,"What, just toss it all?"
00:24:57.121,00:24:58.538,"I don't know, man."
00:24:58.580,00:25:04.086,"They've been saying airlines, mechanic from Cincinnati for years now-- consistently."
00:25:04.128,00:25:06.546,There must be some reason.
00:25:06.588,00:25:08.424,Come here.
00:25:08.466,00:25:11.551,What's the first trap we watch for as profilers?
00:25:11.593,00:25:13.095,Inherited assumptions.
00:25:13.137,00:25:17.433,"So all these preconceptions we just toss out, come at it clean."
00:25:17.475,00:25:25.358,"We know nothing about FC except what the evidence tells us, so if we don't assume that he's an airline worker, what else points to Cincinnati?"
00:25:25.399,00:25:31.030,All the bombs that he planted at the universities-- Was it because he's a resentful outsider or because that's where he felt most safe?
00:25:31.071,00:25:33.573,And here-- All right?
00:25:33.615,00:25:38.829,"When he talked down on people with advanced degrees, is he actually low I.Q."
00:25:36.534,00:25:46.128,"with no higher education, or is he really smart, maybe he has a bunch of degrees and knows we're gonna read this letter and is hoping that we don't think too hard about it?"
00:25:46.170,00:25:50.341,I... wow.
00:25:50.383,00:25:52.634,Yeah.
00:25:52.676,00:25:54.720,I don't know.
00:25:54.761,00:25:56.554,Exactly.
00:25:56.596,00:25:58.807,We don't know.
00:25:58.849,00:26:00.267,We don't know anything.
00:26:01.977,00:26:06.690,"But you go by this profile, your mind is just gonna go like this."
00:26:08.025,00:26:09.068,So we start over.
00:26:09.109,00:26:10.986,"Make a list, everything we need."
00:26:12.654,00:26:15.032,Yes!
00:26:15.074,00:26:18.618,"Respectfully, this is what I need to start over and build a profile we can all stand behind."
00:26:18.660,00:26:26.626,"I know it's a bump in time and in resources, but this is going on the attorney general's desk, it's going in the press with your name on it, so we have to get it right."
00:26:26.668,00:26:31.382,"have you created, outside the classroom, I mean?"
00:26:31.424,00:26:33.300,This is my first.
00:26:33.342,00:26:34.634,"Well, there you go."
00:26:34.676,00:26:37.012,So let me explain to you how this works.
00:26:37.054,00:26:40.099,Your job is to fulfill the duties laid out to you by S.A.C.
00:26:40.140,00:26:41.517,That's Ackerman.
00:26:41.559,00:26:44.644,"He gave you parameters, now go execute."
00:26:44.686,00:26:48.815,"Respectfully, all I'm asking for is the freedom to do excellent work for you. That's all."
00:26:48.857,00:26:51.151,"Otherwise, your profile is gonna hamper your investigation."
00:26:51.193,00:26:51.944,It's not gonna help it.
00:26:53.237,00:26:56.656,"When your only tool's a hammer, son, everything looks like a nail."
00:26:56.698,00:26:59.659,"You're a profiler, you think the profile's gonna catch him."
00:26:59.701,00:27:01.661,Genelli's a gearhead.
00:27:01.703,00:27:03.539,He thinks it's all about his computer.
00:27:03.581,00:27:07.667,We got a guy that's been working on the Unabomber stamp selection for the last five years.
00:27:07.709,00:27:13.799,"To him, a $1 Eugene O'Neill stamp is the key to everything."
00:27:13.840,00:27:20.347,"Now, I inherited that guy and I allow him to pursue that avenue, 'cause, uh, well, you never know."
00:27:20.389,00:27:26.728,"But when I tell him to do something, I expect him to do it."
00:27:26.770,00:27:29.731,"Well, I'm not your stamp guy."
00:27:29.773,00:27:35.070,Even the stamp guy doesn't think he's the stamp guy.
00:27:42.077,00:27:44.288,walk you through it.
00:27:45.122,00:27:47.082,You know what these are?
00:27:47.124,00:27:50.710,"These are profiles of the Unabomber, and we've got them all."
00:27:50.752,00:27:52.630,You want to know where he lives?
00:27:52.670,00:27:54.632,Okay.
00:27:54.672,00:27:59.970,In a house with a room that his wife and kids know never to go into.
00:28:00.012,00:28:04.682,Or maybe with his mother-- a Norman Bates thing going on.
00:28:07.769,00:28:09.647,And this is a classic.
00:28:09.687,00:28:18.738,"It's 20 full pages by the legendary John Douglas about how the Unabomber maintains his car right down to the air freshener, which is royal pine."
00:28:20.115,00:28:31.918,"Now, we've had every top profiler in the business come through here, and every single one of them says he's got to start all over, and every one of them says something completely different, so pardon me if I'm a little skeptical of your profession."
00:28:31.960,00:28:36.756,"Now, Ackerman brought me in here to keep this investigation focused and on track."
00:28:36.798,00:28:40.760,"We've been running around in circles for years, and it's time for that to stop."
00:28:40.802,00:28:50.354,"So instead of 100 different contradictory profiles, we're going with one backed up by concrete forensic evidence, and that's the profile that I gave you."
00:28:50.396,00:28:55.234,"The only way we're gonna catch the Unabomber, same way we catch anybody, that's forensics."
00:28:55.275,00:28:56.776,It's plain and simple.
00:28:56.818,00:29:02.908,"Now, you could spend six months coming up with the world's most accurate profile, but that's not what we're looking for."
00:29:02.949,00:29:08.288,"We're looking for 15 pages, no typos, and wood, and we want to take it to the press next week."
00:29:08.330,00:29:10.249,"Now, I understand that you're a brilliant guy."
00:29:10.290,00:29:11.833,I do.
00:29:11.875,00:29:18.716,"McAlpine says you can all kinds of stuff hidden in letters, and that's great, so take the Unabom letters and find wood."
00:29:18.757,00:29:20.175,Okay?
00:29:20.217,00:29:25.764,"So, right now, all that's required of you is obedience."
00:29:27.683,00:29:28.808,Understand?
00:29:36.734,00:29:42.072,we discussed regional dialects and linguistic prescriptivism.
00:29:42.114,00:29:43.823,See you next week.
00:30:03.885,00:30:06.846,I'm sorry.
00:30:06.888,00:30:09.224,I just didn't know where else to go.
00:30:13.520,00:30:16.231,What happened to you?
00:30:17.149,00:30:19.109,Where'd you go?
00:30:19.901,00:30:21.487,Where have you been?
00:30:21.528,00:30:23.280,"You know, I tried to find you."
00:30:23.322,00:30:24.990,"I called your office, your home."
00:30:25.031,00:30:28.327,I talked to your wife-- everything.
00:30:28.368,00:30:30.329,The Unabom case is over.
00:30:30.370,00:30:33.123,It was over two years ago.
00:30:33.165,00:30:35.709,"It's not over, and I need help."
00:30:35.751,00:30:41.923,"You have to have some place you can go-- family, somebody other than me."
00:30:49.348,00:30:52.643,"Hey. Look, look-- We got a friend!"
00:30:52.685,00:30:56.104,-What's your name?
00:30:56.146,00:31:01.109,"Look, I-I have to defend my dissertation in a couple weeks, so I have to work tonight."
00:31:01.151,00:31:03.696,Hey.
00:31:04.946,00:31:06.281,"All right, I'm gonna take these guys to the kitchen."
00:31:06.323,00:31:08.908,Why don't you-- Why don't you take a shower?
00:31:08.950,00:31:10.744,You can sleep on the couch.
00:31:10.952,00:31:12.871,Come on! Come on!
00:31:27.260,00:31:30.180,They want me to go in and interrogate Ted.
00:31:30.222,00:31:32.683,They need me.
00:31:32.725,00:31:34.476,They need me to get the guilty plea.
00:31:36.436,00:31:38.355,I think that...
00:31:38.980,00:31:41.358,I think I need to confront him and get some answers.
00:31:41.400,00:31:42.942,You have the answers.
00:31:42.984,00:31:44.903,You proved that Ted's the Unabomber.
00:31:45.487,00:31:52.411,"Answers for myself, so I can understand what happened to me-- and where I should go from here."
00:31:52.452,00:31:59.042,And what makes you think that he has answers to any question that matters?
00:31:59.084,00:32:01.044,What do you think?
00:32:01.086,00:32:04.423,You wanted this.
00:32:04.464,00:32:08.009,You wanted him in your life.
00:32:08.051,00:32:10.970,"Secretly, somehow you wanted this."
00:32:11.012,00:32:14.182,That's the answer.
00:32:14.224,00:32:17.519,That's the only way I can make sense of what happened.
00:32:17.561,00:32:20.647,You wanted him in your life more than you wanted anyone or anything else.
00:32:24.276,00:32:25.277,Why would I want that?
00:32:25.318,00:32:27.863,What kind of person would want that?
00:32:32.785,00:32:39.583,"They interview 10,000 Nathan R's, and then they turn to me and say that profiling's a waste of resources."
00:32:39.625,00:32:41.710,"You're a cog in the machine, Fitz."
00:32:41.752,00:32:43.002,"Embrace it, bruh."
00:32:49.050,00:32:52.137,Oh-oh!
00:32:52.178,00:32:55.223,It's our head shrinker come to mingle with the commoners.
00:33:07.235,00:33:08.779,"Hey, where you going, bruh?"
00:33:08.821,00:33:10.989,Sacramento to do my job.
00:33:19.331,00:33:21.040,They want you to obey.
00:33:21.082,00:33:28.423,"They want you to be a sheep like they are sheep-- obedient, unquestioning, piece of machinery."
00:33:28.465,00:33:32.051,"Sit when told to sit, stand when told to stand."
00:33:32.093,00:33:40.059,"They want you to give up your humanity, your autonomy for a paycheck, gold star, bigger TV."
00:33:40.101,00:33:45.273,"The only way to be human, the only way to be free, is to rebel."
00:33:45.315,00:33:46.859,They'll try to crush you.
00:33:46.900,00:33:53.072,"They'll use every tactic they have to make you obedient, docile, subservient, but you can't let them."
00:33:53.114,00:33:57.661,"You have to be your own master, whatever that takes."
00:33:57.703,00:34:03.082,Better to die a human being than to live as a purposeless cog in their machine.
00:34:29.609,00:34:33.697,a week ago.
00:34:47.878,00:34:49.880,This just came.
00:35:30.712,00:35:39.596,"You want to be here, touching this, savoring it."
00:35:52.191,00:35:53.693,But you can't be here.
00:35:53.735,00:35:56.446,You can't be here.
00:35:56.488,00:36:00.909,Ever-- for any of them.
00:36:03.244,00:36:08.667,Why is that enough for you and not any other serial killer?
00:36:08.708,00:36:18.510,"Never to see it, hear it, taste it, never to see Gil Murray's body."
00:36:18.551,00:36:21.387,Because it's not about him.
00:36:21.429,00:36:25.100,"It's not about him as an individual, is it?"
00:36:32.315,00:36:37.236,These aren't people to you.
00:36:37.278,00:36:39.656,They're symbols.
00:36:39.698,00:36:43.076,You're sending a message.
00:36:43.118,00:36:47.413,"That's why you use the mail, 'cause it's a message."
00:36:47.455,00:36:50.125,It's a hidden message.
00:36:50.167,00:36:52.169,And what does it symbolize?
00:36:52.210,00:36:55.714,What does it represent?
00:36:55.755,00:36:57.841,"So, what are you trying to tell us, FC?"
00:37:01.511,00:37:03.638,What are you trying to tell me?
00:37:08.143,00:37:11.104,"Dad, it is I."
00:37:14.649,00:37:16.609,"What are you trying to tell me, FC?"
00:37:21.322,00:37:23.533,What are you trying to tell me?
00:37:36.922,00:37:48.767,"Your whole profile is built on the assumption that FC was one of the airline mechanics that United Airlines laid off in Cincinnati, and that he targeted American Airlines Flight 444 and United president Percy Wood out of a personal grudge, right?"
00:37:48.808,00:37:49.935,Right.
00:37:49.976,00:37:51.686,about mail bombs.
00:37:51.728,00:37:55.314,"He can't hear them, he can't see them, he can't visit the site, he can't view the bodies, anything."
00:37:55.356,00:37:57.984,It's none of the satisfaction of revenge.
00:37:58.026,00:38:00.153,But he keeps bombing anyway.
00:38:00.195,00:38:01.320,Why?
00:38:01.362,00:38:03.740,Because these aren't personal targets.
00:38:03.782,00:38:06.284,They are representational targets.
00:38:06.325,00:38:09.328,Gil Murray was a symbol of something for him.
00:38:09.370,00:38:11.456,All of his targets symbolize something for FC.
00:38:11.497,00:38:14.333,kind of victimology.
00:38:14.375,00:38:18.379,"His victims are random, totally unconnected to each other."
00:38:18.421,00:38:20.048,All right.
00:38:20.090,00:38:28.598,"So he spends years perfecting the most untraceable, sophisticated mail bomb ever created, and then just picks random targets from a phone book?"
00:38:28.640,00:38:38.108,"I don't think it was a random coincidence that these letters spell Dad, it is I, and I don't think it's a random coincidence that he's targeting airlines, scientists, computers, forestry people."
00:38:38.150,00:38:41.360,I think it only seems random because we don't know what connects them.
00:38:41.402,00:38:51.955,"We can't-- We don't know his code, and the reason that we don't know his code is because we're still assuming he's a low-I.Q. pissed-off airline mechanic when he's actually been outsmarting us the whole time."
00:38:51.997,00:38:56.876,We've got hard forensic evidence that he's a trained airline mechanic.
00:38:56.918,00:38:58.837,Look.
00:38:58.878,00:39:08.847,"Batteries soldered in series, encased in a wire cage just like airplane power bricks, he's an expert at casting and shaping aluminum."
00:39:08.888,00:39:11.390,And look. Look at this new switch he's developed.
00:39:11.432,00:39:14.393,It looks exactly like an airplane tail stand on a 747.
00:39:14.435,00:39:15.561,We've had pilots confirm that.
00:39:15.603,00:39:19.274,That only looks like a tail stand if you're looking for proof of the supposition that he's an airline mechanic.
00:39:19.316,00:39:22.652,"If you're objective about it, it's just a switch."
00:39:22.694,00:39:27.824,Do you ever think that the reason you haven't got him in 17 years is that you're underestimating him?
00:39:27.866,00:39:33.038,"There is a powerful intelligence at work here, a deep personal philosophy underpinning all of FC's actions."
00:39:33.079,00:39:37.250,"Now, you figure out the philosophy, you can figure out the man, you can crack the code."
00:39:37.292,00:39:39.502,But not with this.
00:39:39.544,00:39:41.420,We have to start over.
00:39:41.462,00:39:43.340,Get rid of that and start over.
00:39:48.011,00:39:53.432,"Fitz, buddy, you're breaking my heart."
00:39:57.145,00:40:01.482,You are part of a world-class orchestra here.
00:40:01.524,00:40:11.368,"Lots of instruments, lots of virtuosos, and out of all of these players, I'm pointing to you, and I'm saying now is the time for your solo."
00:40:11.409,00:40:17.332,"Stand up, play your heart out so the whole world can hear you."
00:40:18.250,00:40:21.460,But you got to play with the sheet music that I'm giving you.
00:40:21.502,00:40:31.012,"Because you may be a once-in-a-century talent, but if you can't harmonize with the rest of the orchestra, I'm gonna have to send you home."
00:40:48.654,00:40:50.156,"Dude, where have you been?"
00:40:50.198,00:40:51.490,Why ain't you downstairs?
00:40:51.532,00:40:52.700,Didn't Genelli tell you?
00:40:52.742,00:40:54.369,I'm not writing that B.S.
00:40:54.411,00:40:56.162,down to forensics now.
00:40:59.624,00:41:05.046,"You said he had a personal philosophy, some message he's trying to send."
00:41:05.088,00:41:06.256,You were right.
00:41:12.304,00:41:14.264,The New York Times called it in.
00:41:14.306,00:41:16.099,They got a package.
00:41:16.141,00:41:17.600,Another bomb?
00:41:17.642,00:41:19.978,"No, it's something else."
00:41:37.120,00:41:39.538,They're calling it the Unabomber Manifesto.
00:41:50.591,00:41:53.552,"If you screw this up, we'll crucify you."
00:00:16.558,00:00:20.938,you're the ones in control.
00:00:20.980,00:00:27.068,"They obey you, your technology, your machines."
00:00:32.115,00:00:37.705,What if all the airplanes just stopped?
00:00:37.746,00:00:41.500,"Ten years ago, computers were expensive toys."
00:00:41.542,00:00:47.548,"Today, civilization as we know would fall apart without them."
00:00:48.089,00:00:54.763,"You live in terror of a blackout, a computer crash, a car that won't start, a phone that doesn't ring."
00:00:54.805,00:01:00.310,"So you construct your lives, your whole society so that won't happen."
00:01:02.103,00:01:06.107,"Everything revolves around their needs, not yours."
00:01:06.149,00:01:09.653,"They buzz, you jump."
00:01:09.695,00:01:14.867,So ask yourself-- who's really in control?
00:01:14.909,00:01:18.037,You or them?
00:01:45.230,00:01:54.155,"Hey, we just got handed a 56-page manifesto from the most elusive criminal in the world, something so important he wants both The Post and The Times to have it, and I just want five minutes in the lab to read it."
00:01:54.197,00:01:55.156,"I'll gown up, I'll look over their shoulders."
00:01:55.198,00:01:56.157,It's five minutes.
00:01:56.199,00:02:04.583,"There's a system here, a process, a process that begins with a complete forensic analysis-- thorough, unhurried, uncorrupted by meddling rubberneckers."
00:02:04.625,00:02:07.711,"Yeah, I know, but it's a big break in the case, and I'm here to be a word guy, all right?"
00:02:07.753,00:02:10.171,You are here to wait and to do what you're told.
00:02:10.213,00:02:16.177,"A big break in this case comes when we pull a fingerprint off one of those pages, when we find another Nathan R."
00:02:16.219,00:02:21.308,A single strand of hair would be far more valuable than anything you are gonna get from reading the guy's rant.
00:02:21.349,00:02:23.477,"Well, Dad, it is I-- he got that from reading."
00:02:23.518,00:02:25.186,"Yeah, case friggin' closed."
00:02:25.228,00:02:29.024,"We wait for forensics-- a month, a year, however long it takes."
00:02:29.066,00:02:34.738,"And meanwhile, if you want to see some real police work, step inside."
00:02:35.656,00:02:37.741,"Fitz, dude, you got to check this out."
00:02:37.783,00:02:39.200,It's friggin' sweet.
00:02:39.242,00:02:41.161,-You're up.
00:02:39.242,00:02:53.590,"-We analyzed the postal stream of the whole West coast, and we traced the path of every Unabom letter and package from the moment it dropped into a mailbox to sorting and distro to final delivery, where we identified two critical choke points."
00:02:53.632,00:03:02.223,"So, if Unabom decides to keep dropping his mail in the Bay Area, there is a 95% chance that it will be sorted through one of these two facilities."
00:03:02.265,00:03:07.312,Meaning that we train those handlers and sorters to identify a Unabom package.
00:03:07.354,00:03:10.816,Then we could intercept every bomb en route.
00:03:10.858,00:03:13.110,Never have to worry about a Unabom package again.
00:03:13.152,00:03:15.278,"Cool, right?"
00:03:17.280,00:03:21.242,"You still want to tell us about Dad, it is I?"
00:03:21.284,00:03:25.246,Okay. Logistically what are we talking about here?
00:03:25.288,00:03:29.001,945 A and 945 B?
00:03:29.043,00:03:32.004,Those are the checkpoints right here...
00:03:32.046,00:03:41.513,"Dad, it is I tells us he likes word games and puzzles and that he thinks he's smarter than everyone and that he can be sneaking on by us."
00:03:41.555,00:03:49.897,"Which it's kind of true, 'cause no one here noticed 'cause you all underestimated him."
00:03:49.938,00:03:54.818,He has problems talking to people.
00:03:54.860,00:03:58.446,That's why he resorts to cyphers.
00:03:58.488,00:04:01.282,And he's probably got daddy issues.
00:04:01.324,00:04:05.746,"Now, I got all this from a one-page letter."
00:04:05.787,00:04:09.416,Imagine what I would get off a 56-page manifesto.
00:04:12.335,00:04:14.671,"Oh, yeah."
00:04:14.713,00:04:17.257,"Now, that's my partner, right there."
00:04:17.925,00:04:22.137,You'll get your 56 pages after forensics is finished.
00:04:22.179,00:04:22.888,Goodbye.
00:04:25.348,00:04:26.391,"Yeah, it's Cole."
00:04:29.394,00:04:32.147,What?!
00:04:32.189,00:04:33.356,Where?
00:04:33.899,00:04:36.068,from the Unabomber.
00:04:36.110,00:04:39.320,the San Francisco Chronicle-- you're the only person who touched this?
00:04:39.362,00:04:40.948,I'm just an Editorial Intern.
00:04:40.989,00:04:45.326,I just open letters to the Editor as they come in.
00:04:45.368,00:04:46.453,But I-I could have died.
00:04:46.494,00:04:48.413,"I could have been, like, blown up or something."
00:04:52.375,00:04:55.336,-What do you got?
00:04:55.378,00:05:06.098,"It's bad. Warning-- the terrorist group FC, called 'Unabomber' by the FBI, is planning to blow up an airliner out of Los Angeles International Airport sometime during the next six days."
00:05:06.140,00:05:13.396,"To prove that the writer of this letters knows something about FC, the first two digits of their identifying number are 55."
00:05:13.438,00:05:14.689,Is that number a match?
00:05:14.731,00:05:17.985,What's the number he sent The Times?
00:05:18.026,00:05:21.155,What's the authentication number FC sent The Times?
00:05:23.490,00:05:28.245,553254394.
00:05:28.287,00:05:29.955,It's him.
00:05:29.997,00:05:39.089,"Trisha, get Director Freeh on the phone, L.A.P.D. commissioner, FAA, and alert Janet Reno's office, and make it clear we have a potential mass-casualty situation."
00:05:39.131,00:05:43.885,When a letter arrived at a San Francisco newspaper threatening to blow up an airliner...
00:05:43.927,00:05:46.554,They say it bears all the marks of the Unabomber.
00:05:46.596,00:05:51.310,Federal officials believe the sender is the terrorist who has been sending bombs...
00:05:51.350,00:05:53.436,The Unabomber appears to be ready to strike again.
00:05:53.478,00:05:57.816,This time the threatened target is a jetliner flying out of Los Angeles.
00:05:57.858,00:06:00.944,"Frederick Benjamin Isaac Wood, FBI Wood."
00:06:00.986,00:06:03.113,"Uh-huh, but those were planes with depleted fuel tanks."
00:06:03.155,00:06:04.656,-Return address 549...
00:06:03.155,00:06:09.119,-Here we're talking about fully fueled jetliners within a shrapnel radius of an explosive device of unknown size and power.
00:06:09.161,00:06:10.662,How much fuel is in a 747 that's about to take off?
00:06:10.704,00:06:14.124,"Phil, now tell me where we are on refraction beam scanners."
00:06:14.166,00:06:18.337,"So now you see-- No, it's got to be mobile."
00:06:18.377,00:06:21.215,You can't bring items into the airport to be scanned.
00:06:21.256,00:06:22.423,"Jesus, Phil."
00:06:22.465,00:06:24.383,You got to do it on the runway.
00:06:24.425,00:06:26.261,We got to just do it plane by plane.
00:06:26.303,00:06:27.971,-Unbelievable.
00:06:28.013,00:06:30.431,"Lucas. Hey, can I-- can I borrow your pen, please?"
00:06:30.473,00:06:32.391,Thank you.
00:06:32.433,00:06:37.814,"We're at about 30%, but it looks like all the big databases are up and searchable."
00:06:39.524,00:06:42.527,"IRS, USPS..."
00:06:42.569,00:06:44.445,Social Security?
00:06:59.460,00:07:01.213,Do you realize what this means?
00:07:01.255,00:07:04.632,This is gonna be the first major case solved by computer.
00:07:06.093,00:07:09.179,it's driven by the data.
00:07:09.221,00:07:12.891,Think about all the data the government has on its citizens.
00:07:12.933,00:07:16.061,"Addresses, employment, military, census."
00:07:16.103,00:07:24.278,"Eighty years of data, 250,000,000 people, but you can't do anything with it because it's scattered across dozens of different systems."
00:07:24.319,00:07:30.491,"That's why I built the MPP, to bring all that data together in one place for the first time."
00:07:30.533,00:07:36.706,"I mean, look, FC's authentication number looks a lot like a Social Security number, right?"
00:07:36.748,00:07:38.750,And it's a match.
00:07:38.792,00:07:41.128,The number belongs to an Alan Meeks.
00:07:41.169,00:07:43.504,40-year-old white male.
00:07:43.546,00:07:45.506,Then I crunched the USPS data.
00:07:45.548,00:07:49.428,Look where Meeks has been living for the past 30 years.
00:07:49.469,00:07:54.515,"Oakland, San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Sacramento."
00:07:54.557,00:07:58.853,It's all the key locations associated with Unabom activity.
00:07:58.895,00:08:00.563,Where is he now?
00:08:02.565,00:08:04.734,They arrested Meeks right here.
00:08:04.776,00:08:07.154,Recognize the place?
00:08:07.195,00:08:09.530,site of the Hugh Scrutton bomb.
00:08:09.572,00:08:13.618,The Unabomber's first kill returning to the scene of the crime.
00:08:13.660,00:08:19.082,"They're getting Meeks ready for interrogation right now, and I got to know if Meeks is the Unabomber."
00:08:19.124,00:08:22.752,What was he looking for here?
00:08:30.260,00:08:33.054,Why this place?
00:08:33.096,00:08:34.931,Computer rental store.
00:08:34.973,00:08:37.184,Computers. Technology.
00:08:37.225,00:08:40.561,What did these people symbolize to you?
00:08:46.776,00:08:50.530,"You got to work early, you didn't expect them to be there."
00:08:50.571,00:08:53.450,"10 seconds, 20 seconds-- that's all you needed."
00:08:58.830,00:09:04.585,"But she looked, and suddenly the Unabomber was flesh and blood."
00:09:04.627,00:09:08.423,"A man, not a concept, and that's why this scared you so much."
00:09:08.465,00:09:10.842,That's why you stopped for six years...
00:09:16.431,00:09:21.228,"Phyllis, do you have that invoice from Phoenix Games and Hobbies?"
00:09:26.649,00:09:29.319,Are you in the bathroom?
00:09:38.119,00:09:42.582,good to finally succeed.
00:09:56.555,00:09:58.806,"He was reliving it, savoring it."
00:09:58.848,00:10:02.394,Which he never got to do in '85 because of the eyewitness.
00:10:06.273,00:10:08.942,Meeks is ready!
00:10:08.983,00:10:11.111,This could really be him.
00:10:12.487,00:10:15.490,"Read 'em and weep, Fitzy."
00:10:15.532,00:10:17.658,That's the Unabomber.
00:10:19.244,00:10:21.871,Thicker than water.
00:10:21.913,00:10:24.665,So what?
00:10:24.707,00:10:29.212,"You get drunk, you get a tattoo-- I don't remember seeing a spelling mistake in all those letters."
00:10:29.254,00:10:34.301,Does this guy look like the author of a manifesto entitled Industrial Society and its Future ?
00:10:34.342,00:10:38.179,He sure does to me.
00:10:38.221,00:10:45.353,"Here's the thing, I don't think you meant to kill anybody, I think you just wanted to send a message, to scare them a little."
00:10:45.395,00:10:48.940,"I definitely didn't mean to kill anyone, that's for damn sure."
00:10:48.982,00:10:50.650,"Look, I believe you."
00:10:50.691,00:10:53.487,"But these guys, they don't."
00:10:53.528,00:10:57.532,So tell me how to stop LAX.
00:10:57.574,00:11:00.201,-What's LAX?
00:11:00.243,00:11:01.702,-I didn't mean to kill anybody.
00:11:00.243,00:11:03.955,-...I will make your life -a living nightmare.
00:11:01.744,00:11:05.915,"-I can't take back what I did, and I'll live with this the rest of my life."
00:11:05.957,00:11:08.668,I paid my debts to society.
00:11:10.711,00:11:13.714,Wait.
00:11:13.756,00:11:16.926,"Eight years, Iowa State Pen."
00:11:16.968,00:11:20.054,I came out a changed man.
00:11:20.096,00:11:24.976,I never drove drunk again.
00:11:28.771,00:11:31.107,Meeks was in jail half the time the Unabomber was active.
00:11:31.149,00:11:32.651,How come that wasn't in my file?
00:11:32.691,00:11:35.736,"We pulled everything we could-- Cali, Federal."
00:11:35.778,00:11:40.741,You're telling me you don't have Iowa Bureau of Prisons records in your MPP?
00:11:40.783,00:11:45.079,-Didn't we do this before?
00:11:49.792,00:11:52.711,Here.
00:11:52.753,00:11:53.796,What's pure wood?
00:11:53.838,00:11:56.174,Pure Aryan peckerwood.
00:11:56.216,00:11:58.926,Their ain't no jungle-bunny blood in these veins.
00:11:58.968,00:12:02.763,"Right. She's thicker than wudder, right?"
00:12:02.805,00:12:05.141,-Thicker than what?
00:12:05.183,00:12:08.727,"Wudder? Well, where the hell you from?"
00:12:08.769,00:12:12.524,And who talks like that?
00:12:12.566,00:12:14.568,Christ.
00:12:16.486,00:12:18.779,"Fitz, let's go."
00:12:18.821,00:12:26.787,precautions come because a letter was mailed to a San Francisco newspaper from a man the FBI calls the Unabomber.
00:12:26.829,00:12:29.832,Anything?
00:12:29.874,00:12:32.793,"You heard that, too?"
00:12:32.835,00:12:33.836,What Fitz has with his hoagie.
00:12:33.878,00:12:36.464,Wudder?
00:12:36.506,00:12:39.800,"-Tabster, stone cold."
00:12:39.842,00:12:40.801,conference room.
00:12:40.843,00:12:43.722,"I've never heard you say pierogi, but you do say wudder."
00:12:43.762,00:12:46.015,Water. Water.
00:12:46.057,00:12:48.685,I like wudder.
00:12:48.727,00:12:52.855,"So, one word, one tiny slip, and you think you know who I am?"
00:12:52.897,00:12:55.525,Are you seriously pissed off?
00:12:55.567,00:12:57.569,About what?
00:12:57.611,00:13:01.822,"I say one word slightly wrong, and you can all peg me as the Philly street cop out of his depth."
00:13:06.869,00:13:08.829,Dude! Are you serious?
00:13:11.583,00:13:13.752,"So, you can read it."
00:13:13.792,00:13:16.379,Yeah?
00:13:16.421,00:13:19.840,The forensic report. 300 pages that say we found nothing.
00:13:19.882,00:13:21.842,"No, not the report, the document. His document, his manifesto."
00:13:21.884,00:13:24.845,-They're over there.
00:13:24.887,00:13:32.228,"Well, you're talking about three different dossiers, and I don't have them, so-- Hold on a second."
00:13:32.270,00:13:41.237,"For 17 years, the Unabomber has been trying to say something with these bombs, trying to send us a message, and now he lays it out, everything he's been trying to tell us, and you don't want to take the time to read it?"
00:13:41.279,00:13:50.121,"We're dealing with a major airport shutdown here, so write up a three-page synopsis, clean, no typos, and we'll give it a look."
00:13:50.163,00:13:54.000,Yep. All right.
00:13:54.041,00:13:56.294,New Unabom letter sent to The Times.
00:13:56.336,00:13:58.921,-What?
00:13:58.963,00:14:02.925,Jesus!
00:14:02.967,00:14:05.345,Look at page 3.
00:14:12.226,00:14:14.479,Is this guy jerking us around or what?
00:14:14.521,00:14:21.653,"Since the public has a short memory, we decided to play one last 'prank' to remind them who we are."
00:14:21.695,00:14:29.910,"But, no, we haven't tried to plant a bomb Recently is in parentheses."
00:14:29.952,00:14:34.791,-He says it's a prank.
00:14:37.960,00:14:39.920,"It's been authenticated, sir."
00:14:39.962,00:14:43.174,It is definitely from the Unabomber.
00:14:43.216,00:14:45.677,And we will get you our recommendation.
00:14:45.719,00:14:47.679,to get our guard down?
00:14:47.721,00:14:51.932,"He's got a bomb in one of those planes, just waiting for us to clear them for takeoff, and then boom."
00:14:56.688,00:15:00.941,"Personally, I think this whole manifesto thing could be a red herring."
00:15:00.983,00:15:04.612,"We're dealing with a dummy here, an airline mechanic with a G.E.D., max."
00:15:04.654,00:15:15.289,"So, who's to say he didn't retype somebody else's essay to throw us off the scent, to draw us down blind alleys, to keep us away from the real leads in the real world-- forensics?"
00:15:15.331,00:15:20.086,"Sir, now that the manifesto has cleared forensics, I think it's imperative that all our agents read this document."
00:15:20.127,00:15:21.962,"Okay, stop."
00:15:22.004,00:15:25.966,The Unabomber has threatened to blow an airplane out of the sky.
00:15:26.008,00:15:38.979,"I've got four Senators and Janet Reno on my call sheet, asking me whether to believe this letter, where he says he's going to kill a few hundred innocent people, or this one, where he says the bomb threat is just a prank."
00:15:39.021,00:15:40.356,"So, I'm not reading anything else."
00:15:40.398,00:15:45.027,I'm reading this and trying to decide whether LAX can reopen for business.
00:15:45.069,00:15:49.490,"And if I make the wrong call, a few hundred people are gonna be blown out of the sky."
00:15:49.532,00:15:52.076,So give me a profile that answers that question.
00:15:52.118,00:15:55.121,"If not, that's a stack of papers."
00:15:55.162,00:15:57.998,These are human lives.
00:15:58.040,00:15:59.166,Got it?
00:15:59.208,00:16:02.086,Okay. What do we got?
00:16:06.215,00:16:09.051,this? In the manifesto? Listen.
00:16:09.093,00:16:12.472,"In modern society, all that's required of you is obedience."
00:16:12.513,00:16:14.348,Isn't that exactly what Cole said?
00:16:14.390,00:16:16.643,The manifesto has to wait.
00:16:16.684,00:16:19.103,The Unabomber and his bomb threat prank.
00:16:19.145,00:16:22.482,Which one's the truth?
00:16:22.523,00:16:25.485,possibly know that?
00:16:36.078,00:16:39.248,"You know, Fitz, whatever it is you're going through, it didn't start two years ago."
00:16:39.290,00:16:41.041,It didn't start with this case.
00:16:41.083,00:16:46.464,It happened long before the Unabom. It must have.
00:16:46.506,00:16:49.216,I know.
00:16:49.258,00:16:52.178,I just don't know when I started to feel so powerless.
00:16:52.219,00:16:54.138,"Hey, we all feel that way."
00:16:54.180,00:16:56.599,"If everybody feels that way, what do we do about it?"
00:16:56.641,00:16:58.058,Nothing.
00:17:00.102,00:17:06.066,"We like feeling trapped, crushed."
00:17:06.108,00:17:08.987,I guess freedom is far more terrifying than slavery.
00:17:09.028,00:17:10.822,But there's nothing to do.
00:17:10.864,00:17:13.240,It's life. You suck it up and you live.
00:17:13.282,00:17:15.618,That's not-- that's not life.
00:17:15.660,00:17:18.705,That's sleepwalking.
00:17:18.746,00:17:25.837,"Watching TV, eating trash, working to-- to become something for someone else."
00:17:25.879,00:17:27.171,And nobody does anything about it.
00:17:27.213,00:17:29.173,Nobody even tries.
00:17:29.215,00:17:35.638,he's the Unabomber.
00:17:35.680,00:17:40.894,He's evil.
00:17:40.935,00:17:42.269,Just down here.
00:17:55.324,00:17:57.535,You gonna be okay?
00:17:57.577,00:18:01.121,I don't know.
00:18:01.163,00:18:04.166,"I have to go in there, I have to face him."
00:18:44.331,00:18:48.711,"plane, FC, or is it a prank?"
00:18:58.012,00:19:01.557,Boss needs these reports clean.
00:19:01.599,00:19:04.184,"Cole wouldn't be happy, FC."
00:19:25.247,00:19:27.500,Excessive soldering.
00:19:38.094,00:19:39.804,This is the original letter.
00:19:39.846,00:19:44.308,"Look, he punched right through the paper, not just crossing out his mistakes-- obliterating them."
00:19:44.350,00:19:47.227,Profilers talk about signatures versus M.O.
00:19:47.269,00:19:51.190,"M.O. is everything necessary to complete the crime, but signatures are the extras."
00:19:51.231,00:19:54.568,"They reveal the psychology, the character."
00:19:54.610,00:19:56.612,Damn. Like correcting the hell out of that letter.
00:19:56.654,00:19:58.238,"Yeah, that's right."
00:19:58.280,00:20:04.162,"But, uh, the Rentech bomb, the forensic report says something about excessive soldering."
00:20:04.203,00:20:06.539,"His signature, definitely."
00:20:06.580,00:20:09.083,How do you know that?
00:20:11.293,00:20:13.253,Don't worry.
00:20:13.295,00:20:17.175,But it's the exact copy of the way that bomb looked before it blew up.
00:20:17.216,00:20:19.927,You built this?
00:20:19.969,00:20:22.388,What's wrong with you?
00:20:22.429,00:20:26.266,You sure you're not the Unabomber?
00:20:26.308,00:20:29.145,And all this is forensic evidence?
00:20:29.187,00:20:32.314,"Yes, sir. I built this and a few others."
00:20:32.356,00:20:35.693,"Bosses thought it was a waste of time, but I learned a lot by doing it."
00:20:35.735,00:20:42.075,He carves FC on the most indestructible component of each bomb-- the part that he's sure will survive the blast.
00:20:42.116,00:20:44.035,we know it's him.
00:20:44.077,00:20:52.626,"soldering, he just floods all the connections like he's trying to hide them, then there's tons of extra epoxy all at the joints that no one seemed to report."
00:20:52.668,00:20:55.213,Totally unnecessary.
00:20:55.254,00:20:58.298,Signatures. Not M.O.
00:20:58.340,00:21:01.635,He didn't want anyone to see the cracks.
00:21:06.807,00:21:08.601,What's your name again?
00:21:08.642,00:21:11.520,Ernie Esposito.
00:21:11.562,00:21:14.356,"Thanks, Ernie."
00:21:24.450,00:21:27.327,This is my analysis on the LAX bomb threat.
00:21:27.369,00:21:29.329,"It's clean, no typos, lots of big words."
00:21:29.371,00:21:32.166,"Janet Reno will read it, and she'll be impressed by you."
00:21:32.208,00:21:35.335,What's the bottom line?
00:21:35.377,00:21:38.005,"Well, in my opinion, it's a prank."
00:21:38.047,00:21:39.632,There's no bomb at LAX.
00:21:39.673,00:21:43.052,"FC cares about his reputation, his credibility."
00:21:43.094,00:21:45.596,"He's ashamed of his mistakes, and he tries to obliterate them."
00:21:45.638,00:21:50.350,He tries to hide all the joints in his bombs so we don't see the work.
00:21:50.392,00:21:53.104,He's obsessed with presenting this perfect public image.
00:21:53.146,00:21:56.356,"He wants to be seen as intelligent, as logical, as superior."
00:21:56.398,00:22:02.613,"But it's a fragile self image, because he's really just afraid that everyone's gonna see his flaws."
00:22:02.655,00:22:05.407,"Now, the bomb threat, that services his need for power."
00:22:05.449,00:22:11.205,"You know, he enjoys making us squirm, but his reputation, that's the most important thing he has."
00:22:11.247,00:22:25.719,"And he's not gonna give us the ammunition to go to the press so they can hold up something that he wrote and say, This guy's untrustworthy, he's a liar, he's a blood-thirsty lunatic who has no credibility and will say anything to kill people."
00:22:25.761,00:22:29.556,"It's just all my opinion, but, um, you know, I can back it up."
00:22:29.598,00:22:35.395,"Including the physical evidence, I stand by it."
00:22:35.437,00:22:42.402,"The thing about Fitz-- he's no B.S.er, for better or for worse."
00:22:42.444,00:22:45.698,"Okay, we're gonna read it and pass it up the chain."
00:22:45.739,00:22:47.407,Thanks for this.
00:22:47.449,00:22:52.454,"This might cross Janet Reno's desk, so stay close."
00:22:54.456,00:22:57.293,you get a gold star.
00:22:57.335,00:22:59.419,A little obedience is all it takes.
00:22:59.461,00:23:03.423,"I think FC says that in the manifesto, too."
00:23:03.465,00:23:05.134,in your three-page summary.
00:23:05.176,00:23:09.055,Leadership tips from the Unabomber.
00:23:18.731,00:23:21.399,Now we dig in.
00:23:25.403,00:23:27.323,Let's go for the big picture.
00:23:27.365,00:23:31.451,"He wrote 56 pages, laying out his philosophy of the modern world."
00:23:31.493,00:23:34.872,He called it Industrial Society and its Future.
00:23:34.914,00:23:37.291,We call it his manifesto.
00:23:37.333,00:23:40.169,"So, he sends the bombs as messages."
00:23:40.211,00:23:42.838,He's struggling to make himself heard.
00:23:42.880,00:23:45.799,"-So, what's the message?"
00:23:45.841,00:23:50.346,"-All right, technology sucks."
00:23:50.388,00:23:52.472,a door into his mind.
00:23:52.514,00:23:54.600,"We need to step through it, so..."
00:23:54.641,00:24:01.690,"Opening line, The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race."
00:24:01.732,00:24:04.484,"Technology was supposed to set us free, but it doesn't."
00:24:04.526,00:24:09.949,"Like the car thing. Cars were invented, and then, we're all suddenly free to go wherever we want."
00:24:09.990,00:24:12.743,"But then, basically, it becomes mandatory to have a car."
00:24:12.785,00:24:15.746,"So, instead of becoming more free, we become more limited, more constrained."
00:24:15.788,00:24:23.670,"I mean, every city in society is all rearranged around cars until you can't even buy food without driving somewhere."
00:24:23.712,00:24:26.257,"Yeah, TV seemed harmless, too, before we flipped them around."
00:24:26.299,00:24:29.385,We put CCTV cameras everywhere and turned it into a tool to watch us.
00:24:29.427,00:24:33.180,We can't even drive fast if we're in a hurry or slow if we want to chill out.
00:24:33.222,00:24:35.515,We started in charge.
00:24:35.557,00:24:39.519,Now we're slaves to our own technology.
00:24:39.561,00:24:49.447,"Human beings are being permanently reduced to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine, deprived of dignity, autonomy, and freedom."
00:24:49.487,00:24:52.574,The only option available to us is obedience.
00:24:52.616,00:25:12.678,"We're being turned into caged rats, distracted from the maze by the meaningless cheese we're running after-- status, promotion, money, nicer cars, bigger houses, more TVs, blasted with entertainment, adjusted with therapy and Prozac till you don't even want to be free anymore."
00:25:12.719,00:25:16.890,"Or if you can't be adjusted, the psych ward."
00:25:20.353,00:25:23.356,Or prison.
00:25:27.234,00:25:33.073,"The only alternative, the only hope for us, the only way to break free..."
00:25:35.493,00:25:38.578,...is to blow the whole thing up.
00:25:43.959,00:25:46.086,I'm ready.
00:26:09.443,00:26:12.446,"Ted, as your attorney, I'm begging you to reconsider this."
00:26:12.488,00:26:15.615,Do not go in there alone with Fitzgerald.
00:26:15.657,00:26:22.789,"It is unthinkably reckless for the defendant in a capital case to, A, talk with the arresting agent, and B, do so without counsel present."
00:26:24.708,00:26:26.710,This is a huge risk for you.
00:26:26.752,00:26:28.421,And there's no reason to take it.
00:26:28.462,00:26:29.880,Let me come in there with you.
00:26:29.922,00:26:32.925,"I'll stay out of the way, just observe, and be ready to step in."
00:26:35.969,00:26:37.513,I'll be in the next room the whole time.
00:26:37.555,00:26:42.518,"All you need to do to end the interview is to ask for me, okay?"
00:26:49.149,00:26:51.485,a guilty plea from Ted.
00:26:51.527,00:26:53.487,This is our only shot.
00:26:53.529,00:26:55.864,You're our only shot.
00:26:57.366,00:27:00.494,Right.
00:27:00.536,00:27:02.662,Give us a second.
00:27:11.088,00:27:15.675,"We know Ted Kaczynski's the Unabomber, but we can't go to trial."
00:27:15.717,00:27:18.678,This case hangs on so many different technicalities.
00:27:18.720,00:27:22.933,"If we go before a jury, if we roll that dice..."
00:27:22.975,00:27:25.394,"These are dangerous, uncertain times."
00:27:25.436,00:27:28.063,Look at Waco.
00:27:28.105,00:27:31.024,even the Menendez brothers hung their juries.
00:27:31.066,00:27:34.027,The Unabomber has an I.Q. of 168.
00:27:34.069,00:27:36.530,Think about that-- 168.
00:27:36.572,00:27:39.283,"If Ted Kaczynski goes to trial, he could walk."
00:27:39.325,00:27:41.076,"If he walks, he disappears."
00:27:41.118,00:27:43.078,"If he disappears, he's back in action."
00:27:43.120,00:27:45.914,"Only this time, we'll never find him."
00:27:50.752,00:27:53.464,"Listen, Fitz."
00:27:53.506,00:27:59.719,I think Ted asked for you because he recognized a kindred spirit.
00:27:59.761,00:28:01.430,Play into that.
00:28:01.472,00:28:05.142,"Make him feel smart, understood, sympathized with."
00:28:05.184,00:28:07.727,"Build a connection, but stay opaque."
00:28:07.769,00:28:09.188,Don't give him too much.
00:28:09.229,00:28:12.650,He knows you as well as you know him. Better.
00:28:12.690,00:28:17.779,"He's gonna be probing you for weaknesses all the time, looking for anything to go against us."
00:28:21.408,00:28:26.788,"Get him talking, build a connection, then start to steer him towards the guilty plea."
00:28:28.915,00:28:32.378,"You're trying to help him, trying to save him from the electric chair."
00:28:32.419,00:28:34.754,"You're his only friend, but do it gently."
00:28:34.796,00:28:36.965,"Don't spook him, okay?"
00:28:37.007,00:28:38.758,Get him there.
00:29:07.829,00:29:09.707,Okay.
00:29:24.846,00:29:29.309,Agent Fitzgerald?
00:29:29.351,00:29:35.190,I am so glad to make your acquaintance at last.
00:29:39.570,00:29:41.821,a good time for you?
00:29:41.863,00:29:46.910,"I already talked to Kim about taking the days Nancy says she can cover for me, and Mom would watch the boys."
00:29:46.952,00:29:52.374,"So, just tell me when to buy a ticket."
00:29:54.960,00:29:57.379,That's great.
00:29:57.421,00:30:02.842,call me back - when I won't be just talking to myself?
00:30:02.884,00:30:06.555,I'm here. I'm here.
00:30:06.597,00:30:13.687,"It's just, you know-- you know..."
00:30:16.440,00:30:22.571,What's going on with you?
00:30:22.613,00:30:27.075,I'm just gonna call you back.
00:30:48.722,00:30:52.351,"Um, that's for today."
00:30:52.392,00:30:57.897,Fitz. Right now.
00:30:57.939,00:31:06.239,"the FAA reports, L.A.P.D. and, uh, airport briefings, read the material S.A.C. Ackerman sent."
00:31:06.281,00:31:11.704,"Based on what we've seen, uh, A.G.'s office is good to sign off on reopening LAX."
00:31:11.745,00:31:14.832,"How about you, Bill?"
00:31:16.958,00:31:21.921,I'll confirm that from our end and give the green light to flight control.
00:31:21.963,00:31:25.925,"I see the green light here, good to reopen runways."
00:31:25.967,00:31:27.886,First plane should be up momentarily.
00:31:27.927,00:31:33.016,"Flight control, this is S.A.C. Ackerman, permission to stay on the line?"
00:31:47.989,00:31:53.662,is airborne.
00:31:53.704,00:31:58.500,United 732 airborne.
00:31:58.542,00:32:01.961,TWA one-niner-niner airborne.
00:32:09.135,00:32:13.265,This is American flight 7.
00:32:13.306,00:32:14.974,"Climbing to 20,000."
00:32:17.018,00:32:19.688,"We're approaching 10,000."
00:32:19.730,00:32:25.694,we're climbing now.
00:32:25.736,00:32:28.988,"KLM 206, cruising altitude, over."
00:32:29.030,00:32:31.491,cruising altitude.
00:32:31.533,00:32:36.747,"we're at 25,000, reaching cruising altitude now."
00:32:36.789,00:32:38.998,"cruising altitude, over."
00:32:50.051,00:32:53.263,"You hear that, agent?"
00:32:53.305,00:32:55.557,Loud and clear.
00:32:55.599,00:32:57.142,Thank God.
00:33:17.746,00:33:18.831,You made the right call.
00:33:18.872,00:33:20.874,I shouldn't have made any call.
00:33:20.916,00:33:24.711,"All those people on the plane, and it was based on what, on some letters?"
00:33:24.753,00:33:27.881,It was the right call.
00:33:31.760,00:33:37.223,"You really think you can get something good out of this manifesto, something worthwhile?"
00:33:37.265,00:33:40.936,Yeah.
00:33:40.978,00:33:43.647,Okay.
00:33:43.689,00:33:48.652,"And a team, if you want it."
00:33:48.694,00:33:50.529,Maybe you'll even read the manifesto now.
00:33:50.570,00:33:54.032,I will. We all will.
00:33:54.073,00:33:57.076,"Actually, I already tried to read it. Oh, no, I did."
00:33:57.118,00:34:01.665,"But, come on, end notes and all these dead sentences."
00:34:01.707,00:34:06.085,Who writes like this?
00:34:06.127,00:34:09.047,Who writes like this?
00:34:12.258,00:34:14.093,Fitz?
00:34:37.910,00:34:40.119,Who writes like this?
00:34:51.381,00:34:55.260,"When I say wudder, you learn everything about me."
00:34:55.301,00:35:02.601,"One tiny word, one tiny mistake, and you can tell I'm from Philly, blue-collar, local school, fan of Dave Schultz."
00:35:02.642,00:35:10.108,"Just like when you say bruh, it could only be from San Francisco, right?"
00:35:10.149,00:35:15.822,"What if there's a wudder or bruh in here, in the manifesto?"
00:35:15.864,00:35:21.078,"I mean, how do we even start to look for that?"
00:35:21.119,00:35:23.288,I don't know.
00:35:25.373,00:35:28.460,"Get some coffee on then, bruh."
00:35:55.361,00:35:57.405,Long way from Montana.
00:35:57.447,00:36:03.369,"Oh, yeah, well, most people carry their cage with them wherever they go."
00:36:03.411,00:36:08.333,"At least if I remain disgusted by this place, I know I'm still alive."
00:36:08.374,00:36:10.627,Still free in here.
00:36:10.669,00:36:13.630,-So why me?
00:36:13.672,00:36:15.674,You wrote the document that put me in here.
00:36:15.715,00:36:24.223,"Your linguistic analysis of the manifesto got them the search warrant, the search warrant got them the evidence-- The document that put you in here... you wrote."
00:36:28.520,00:36:31.982,I am becoming very well-acquainted with your work.
00:36:32.024,00:36:34.860,It is the product of great imagination.
00:36:34.901,00:36:42.742,"What I really appreciate about you is that most people take language for granted, but not you."
00:36:42.784,00:36:48.665,"You saw it differently, and that is the first step toward becoming free-- a shift in perspective."
00:36:48.707,00:36:54.880,"Manifesto, for instance-- I never liked that moniker."
00:36:54.921,00:37:03.471,"It makes it sound like an unconsidered rant, and you and I both appreciate the power and specificity of words."
00:37:03.513,00:37:13.648,"Manifesto versus article, insanity versus enlightenment, mental breakdown versus unextended leave from active duty."
00:37:13.690,00:37:22.490,"You have had a change of life circumstance, since your work on the Unabom case, am I wrong?"
00:37:22.532,00:37:25.577,"-Yeah, I have."
00:37:25.618,00:37:26.703,Yeah.
00:37:26.745,00:37:31.041,What was it?
00:37:31.083,00:37:34.127,When did it all click?
00:37:37.797,00:37:39.298,No?
00:37:39.340,00:37:43.678,"Well, for me, uh, it all began in Chicago."
00:37:43.720,00:37:56.441,"One day, this mockingbird began singing in the backyard there, you know, that puffed-up confidence just belting out his song, and I began to realize that the mockingbird is singing the car alarm."
00:37:56.482,00:37:59.402,"Ba-beep, ba-beep."
00:37:59.444,00:38:08.078,"Rrr, rrr. And I-- I just sat there, listening to that poor, dumb bird for maybe an hour straight, thinking, What have we done?"
00:38:08.120,00:38:11.873,"How wrong that was, and it stuck with me."
00:38:11.915,00:38:24.469,"I kept coming back to it, just trying to figure out where in the world we had gone so wrong that it had ended up here."
00:38:24.510,00:38:29.141,"For me, it was the part about driving."
00:38:29.182,00:38:32.727,"Every time I got in the car, I thought about it."
00:38:32.769,00:38:36.815,"The more I drove, the more it made sense."
00:38:40.068,00:38:46.365,"Like, there was this one night I was driving home from work, and there was nobody on the street-- I mean, nobody."
00:38:46.407,00:38:51.121,"And I'm sitting there at a red light, just waiting, waiting."
00:38:55.041,00:39:00.672,And there's no cars anywhere.
00:39:00.713,00:39:05.969,"But, still, I sat there."
00:39:06.011,00:39:10.515,"That's when I realized it's not about technology, it's not about machines."
00:39:10.556,00:39:13.392,It's about what they're doing to us.
00:39:13.434,00:39:17.438,"It's about what they're doing to us, what they do to our hearts, 'cause our hearts are no longer free."
00:39:17.480,00:39:19.440,-And you wanted to be free.
00:39:19.482,00:39:21.818,"You wanted your human dignity, your autonomy."
00:39:21.860,00:39:24.612,-Yeah. But-- -Everybody wants that.
00:39:24.654,00:39:29.742,"People want it so badly, they're dying by the thousands every day, just trying to salvage some of their humanity."
00:39:29.784,00:39:38.126,-Okay-- -Think about this-- more people have died from suicide in just the time we've been talking than I allegedly killed in my entire career.
00:39:38.168,00:39:42.214,"More people died from anti-depressants, plastic surgery, fast-food."
00:39:42.255,00:39:46.551,Why-- w-why is everybody so terrified of me?
00:39:46.592,00:39:56.061,And ask yourself this question-- why are these men in suits so desperate to prove that I'm crazy?
00:39:56.102,00:39:57.854,I will tell you.
00:40:01.524,00:40:04.861,-I'm awake. They're asleep.
00:40:04.903,00:40:17.415,"they might have to wake up, too, and turn off their cellphones and their TVs and their video games and face themselves the way that you and I have."
00:40:17.456,00:40:19.251,You and I?
00:40:19.292,00:40:21.127,You and I.
00:40:21.169,00:40:23.963,"Ted, I came here 'cause I believe in what you wrote."
00:40:26.549,00:40:33.472,"I think you asked me here 'cause you need an ally to help save your life, so you can spread your message and change things."
00:40:33.514,00:40:36.226,Really change things.
00:40:36.268,00:40:38.770,-Right.
00:40:38.811,00:40:41.480,-I think a guilty plea-- -No.
00:40:44.525,00:40:47.028,And he was doing so well.
00:40:47.070,00:40:52.575,I can talk about my options with any one of these Barbary apes watching through the cameras.
00:40:53.534,00:40:59.832,But I chose you-- because I thought you were different.
00:41:02.210,00:41:07.506,"Next time, you might bring me some writing paper and some stamps."
00:41:07.548,00:41:12.178,"They're so stingy in here, and I have so much correspondence."
00:41:12.220,00:41:14.513,It's really quite overwhelming.
00:41:17.183,00:41:19.269,Thank you.
00:00:13.931,00:00:23.440,"If you think that you and the group you came here with from San Diego, if you think you folks are happy now, wait until they open those doors."
00:00:42.918,00:00:45.754,"Hey, Kitty, you should rotate, or you're gonna get bedsores."
00:00:45.796,00:00:48.674,"Hey, I walked to the fridge and back twice today."
00:00:48.716,00:00:51.802,"Oh, twice."
00:00:51.844,00:00:53.428,-Mwah!
00:00:53.470,00:00:54.889,"Soup, I guess."
00:00:54.930,00:00:57.057,I just got back from the clinic about three minutes ago.
00:00:57.098,00:00:59.100,"-Ohh, that's a long day."
00:00:59.142,00:01:01.687,Is that from Talbot's?
00:01:01.729,00:01:05.065,"No. Uh, it's for Dad."
00:01:06.149,00:01:08.736,"Well, people have been sending things since The Times article."
00:01:08.777,00:01:11.321,Do I need to be worried about all this fan mail that you're getting?
00:01:11.363,00:01:13.114,"Well, that depends how the soup turns out."
00:01:13.156,00:01:14.616,-That's my guy.
00:01:14.658,00:01:19.120,Ew. Are you seriously joking about having an affair?
00:01:19.162,00:01:20.831,"Hey, are you gonna watch this with me later?"
00:01:25.168,00:01:26.503,Dad? Dad?
00:01:27.295,00:01:29.130,-Charlie!
00:01:32.175,00:01:35.596,"-Oh, no. No, no, no."
00:01:35.637,00:01:37.180,your connection.
00:01:37.222,00:01:44.354,"He knows you can talk about his ideas, that you're his equal, that he made the right call on asking to speak to you and only you."
00:01:44.396,00:01:46.147,Now turn it.
00:01:46.189,00:01:48.149,"No more feelings, no more theories."
00:01:48.191,00:01:49.944,Hit him hard with the facts.
00:01:49.985,00:01:52.738,He's about to be buried under a mountain of hard evidence.
00:01:52.780,00:01:55.115,Going to trial is suicide.
00:01:55.156,00:01:56.533,"Control, he's desperate for control."
00:01:56.575,00:01:58.702,He thinks going to trial will give him that control.
00:01:58.744,00:02:02.330,Make him understand that we own the courtroom.
00:02:02.372,00:02:05.584,The only thing that gives him wiggle room is to plead guilty.
00:02:09.755,00:02:11.339,He wants the control.
00:02:12.925,00:02:15.218,He loves the control.
00:02:21.600,00:02:24.144,Here we go.
00:02:24.185,00:02:25.520,"You can do this, Fitz."
00:02:39.242,00:02:42.621,Do you ever think about what you leave behind as you move through this world?
00:02:42.663,00:02:47.626,Do you mean as in leave your campsite cleaner than when you found it?
00:02:47.668,00:02:53.841,"My dad, he made me join the Boy Scouts, thought it might help me make friends."
00:02:53.882,00:02:55.676,It didn't.
00:02:53.882,00:02:58.219,But it did teach me to leave my campsite cleaner than when I found it.
00:02:58.261,00:03:04.225,"But what does that matter if, the next day, a logging company comes in and chops the whole forest down?"
00:03:05.268,00:03:09.898,"like all that you leave behind, like at the Charles Epstein bombing site."
00:03:09.940,00:03:20.617,"You know, you hadn't sent a package in six years, and then, on June 22, 1993, man in Tiburon opens a brown padded envelope, and..."
00:03:23.620,00:03:26.247,...his whole torso is ripped apart.
00:03:26.289,00:03:29.250,I think I read about that one in the newspaper.
00:03:29.292,00:03:32.379,"-A geneticist, right?"
00:03:33.630,00:03:35.716,He had a daughter.
00:03:35.757,00:03:40.095,"When a man interacts with the world, he leaves traces everywhere."
00:03:40.137,00:03:45.809,"Now, every action, every step that you took, you've been shedding clues-- not one, not two, but hundreds, thousands."
00:03:45.851,00:03:50.271,And they have a warehouse filled with evidence.
00:03:52.315,00:03:54.651,This is a trigger switch.
00:03:54.693,00:03:58.655,It's precise. It's unique.
00:03:58.697,00:04:04.285,Forensics found one virtually intact at the scene.
00:04:04.327,00:04:07.206,They found an identical switch at your cabin.
00:04:07.247,00:04:16.715,"This is, uh, wire clippings, springs, copper pipe, aluminum scraps-- all matched."
00:04:18.759,00:04:21.636,Stamps.
00:04:21.678,00:04:26.850,"These are stamps from the Epstein package, and these are stamps from your cabin."
00:04:26.892,00:04:32.439,"You traveled three days from Lincoln, Montana, to mail the package in San Francisco."
00:04:32.480,00:04:45.619,"You paid cash, you used disguises, which was smart, except, in your cabin, we found six pairs of sunglasses, some fake mustaches, and then your journal entries logging your disguises."
00:04:46.036,00:05:01.676,"This is the chemical components of the explosive mixture and, um, the epoxy that was used in the box, your typewriter that was used for the address label, carbon paper, and a receipt for the carbon paper."
00:05:01.718,00:05:09.810,"It just goes on and on, and, Ted, they have thousands of pieces of evidence that can link you to the Unabom, but they only need one to convict you."
00:05:09.851,00:05:17.317,"They're gonna bury you under a mountain of evidence, and all your autonomy is gonna go out the window the first day of trial."
00:05:19.360,00:05:21.863,He's looking good.
00:05:24.783,00:05:27.077,I want you to change the world.
00:05:27.119,00:05:29.537,I want you to start a revolution.
00:05:29.579,00:05:38.421,"But if you fight this-- if you fight this, you are gonna lose control of everything in your life."
00:05:38.463,00:05:44.343,You're gonna be a helpless cog in the machine of justice until they strap you down to the electric chair.
00:05:45.179,00:05:47.555,You have one option.
00:05:47.597,00:05:53.394,"It's gonna give you some bargaining power, but you got only one."
00:05:53.436,00:05:55.189,Plead guilty.
00:05:55.230,00:05:57.232,is for one bomb.
00:05:57.274,00:06:01.402,There were 15 others that we haven't even talked about.
00:06:01.444,00:06:05.364,So trust me.
00:06:12.455,00:06:14.333,All right.
00:06:16.417,00:06:20.379,"If that's my only option, I'll do it."
00:06:24.843,00:06:27.512,"-That's it, right?"
00:06:27.554,00:06:32.226,Can I ask you one question?
00:06:32.267,00:06:34.435,Anything.
00:06:34.477,00:06:46.447,"Since you've been so helpful walking me through what evidence the F.B.I. has, I was hoping you might confirm for me something I've suspected for a long time but could never get a straight answer to."
00:06:46.489,00:06:55.456,But it seems to me that there is no forensic evidence whatsoever tying me to these heinous crimes besides what you found in my cabin.
00:06:55.498,00:06:58.126,"Yeah, but they got so much evidence of every type."
00:06:58.168,00:07:02.630,Imagine if you could throw out all that evidence.
00:07:02.672,00:07:04.465,"There'd be nothing left, right?"
00:07:04.507,00:07:06.301,Because it's all here on the table.
00:07:06.343,00:07:08.762,You just laid it all out in front of me.
00:07:09.971,00:07:11.431,Yeah.
00:07:12.349,00:07:18.772,"James, do you really not have any idea why I brought you here?"
00:07:21.566,00:07:23.443,Huh.
00:07:29.324,00:07:32.493,This is your search warrant.
00:07:32.535,00:07:34.871,It's based on your linguistic analysis.
00:07:34.913,00:07:46.758,"This is-- this is what got you into my cabin, and the prosecution's entire case rests on this one document, your-- your document."
00:07:47.634,00:07:49.052,"No, what-- what's he doing?"
00:07:49.094,00:07:58.061,we could discuss something I learned about only recently called fruit of the poisonous tree.
00:07:58.686,00:08:08.696,That's the option that you're neglecting to mention-- the option where I get all this evidence thrown out and I walk away a free man.
00:08:08.738,00:08:13.076,The only evidence connecting me to the Unabom attacks was found inside my cabin.
00:08:13.118,00:08:14.453,The only reason the F.B.I.
00:08:14.494,00:08:30.551,"was legally allowed to search my cabin was because of your search warrant, but if that search warrant was issued on false pretenses or based on arguments that fail to meet the burden of proof, well, then all the evidence found at that location is deemed fruit of the poisonous tree."
00:08:30.593,00:08:33.388,It's tainted.
00:08:33.430,00:08:34.555,It's got to be thrown out.
00:08:34.597,00:08:42.563,"So if the search warrant goes, then all their mountains of evidence simply..."
00:08:44.441,00:08:46.734,...disappear.
00:08:48.611,00:08:50.738,Do you follow?
00:08:53.492,00:09:05.920,"The evidence from the cabin depends on the search warrant, but the search warrant depends on this thing called forensic linguistics, which is a field that you just invented, James R. Fitzgerald."
00:09:05.962,00:09:11.801,There is no precedent in all legal history for a search warrant based on linguistic analysis.
00:09:11.843,00:09:20.268,"So the question I then place before the court becomes, do we trust this man as so expert that we trust his invention?"
00:09:20.310,00:09:26.566,"Where did you get your formal training in linguistics, your PhD, your Master's?"
00:09:28.651,00:09:34.741,"As I hear it, the majority of your law enforcement career was spent on the graffiti squad of a small-town police department."
00:09:34.782,00:09:36.117,Is that right?
00:09:36.159,00:09:41.664,"Now, would you say that this time spent reading graffiti constitutes your linguistic training?"
00:09:41.706,00:09:45.544,"By the way, we haven't even gotten to -the content of the warrant yet."
00:09:45.585,00:09:48.547,Perhaps I should leave you with my annotations.
00:09:48.588,00:09:50.549,They're quite extensive.
00:09:50.590,00:09:52.633,We got to get him out of there.
00:09:52.675,00:09:54.052,I was right.
00:09:54.094,00:09:57.556,"Mm. Well, it doesn't really matter if you're right."
00:09:57.597,00:09:59.433,It matters if they believe in you.
00:09:59.474,00:10:01.935,"And if they don't believe in you, then they can't trust the warrant."
00:10:01.976,00:10:06.647,"And if they can't trust the warrant, then I walk out of here."
00:10:06.689,00:10:09.150,Interview is over. Stop.
00:10:09.192,00:10:11.152,Everything you touched is tainted.
00:10:11.194,00:10:12.612,You need look no further.
00:10:12.653,00:10:13.780,Give me those.
00:10:13.821,00:10:15.656,You are the poisonous tree.
00:10:15.698,00:10:19.619,Don't say anything else.
00:10:21.871,00:10:23.081,Good chat.
00:10:48.731,00:10:52.693,I found one.
00:10:52.735,00:11:01.661,"Paragraph 185, As for the negative consequences of eliminating industrial society, well, you can't eat your cake and have it, too."
00:11:02.745,00:11:08.418,"Eat your cake and have it, too."
00:11:08.460,00:11:10.629,It's backwards.
00:11:10.670,00:11:14.715,It's backwards.
00:11:14.757,00:11:16.843,Why aren't you cheering?
00:11:16.884,00:11:18.970,We're looking for mistakes.
00:11:19.012,00:11:22.182,Okay. Cool. But what does it tell us about the Unabomber?
00:11:22.223,00:11:28.104,"We're looking for a wudder, right, something that tells us who he is, -where he comes from."
00:11:28.146,00:11:31.065,Thank you for quoting me telling you what to do.
00:11:31.107,00:11:32.900,What crawled up your ass and died?
00:11:32.942,00:11:35.778,Ackerman gave us an office and a team to comb the manifesto.
00:11:35.820,00:11:38.323,"After two weeks, we got nothing."
00:11:38.365,00:11:41.075,"Well, I have something."
00:11:41.117,00:11:43.119,"Check it out, yo."
00:11:44.204,00:11:46.789,"Manifesto, paragraph 11."
00:11:54.339,00:11:55.923,These aren't mistakes.
00:11:55.965,00:12:00.387,"Someone calls me a broad, that's a mistake, one they would not make a second time."
00:12:00.428,00:12:02.096,Negro will get your ass kicked.
00:12:02.138,00:12:03.515,"Ernie, you're a nerd."
00:12:04.807,00:12:06.100,"-Huh, broad?"
00:12:06.142,00:12:08.144,Let's go with this.
00:12:08.186,00:12:10.813,"Let's go with it, all right?"
00:12:11.606,00:12:13.149,What's-- Who talks like this?
00:12:14.984,00:12:17.736,"My dad, Wally, he talked like this, but..."
00:12:19.656,00:12:21.908,It's generational.
00:12:21.949,00:12:22.867,It's generational.
00:12:22.909,00:12:27.372,"So no one 30 to 40 years old would use those words, right?"
00:12:27.414,00:12:29.708,-Right?
00:12:29.748,00:12:31.292,I don't know.
00:12:31.334,00:12:32.460,What-- what-- what else does it tell us?
00:12:32.502,00:12:36.797,"Well, well, also, if he used these words, then this is a guy who's never been around black folks..."
00:12:36.839,00:12:37.882,-Mm-hmm.
00:12:37.924,00:12:39.342,-There you go.
00:12:39.384,00:12:43.597,"When you're pretty much the only black guy in the UTF, you get lots of practice picking up on language clues."
00:12:43.638,00:12:46.807,"So with that, he wouldn't live in San Francisco proper, right?"
00:12:46.849,00:12:49.227,Except every letter and package was mailed from here.
00:12:49.269,00:12:51.104,Ooh.
00:12:52.855,00:12:54.815,Okay. All right.
00:12:54.857,00:12:56.901,Don't worry about it.
00:12:56.943,00:13:02.907,"Maybe he does, 'cause he lives in the suburbs within driving distance."
00:13:02.949,00:13:05.076,Yes.
00:13:05.118,00:13:07.912,Give me every language clue that we have found in the manifesto.
00:13:07.954,00:13:12.917,"Okay, well, um, Negro, chick, broad, eat your cake, though I don't know where that gets us."
00:13:12.959,00:13:14.085,Go on. Come on.
00:13:14.127,00:13:18.715,"Uh, the long sentences, the formal style-- -trying to sound smart."
00:13:18.757,00:13:20.174,"They're variant spellings, they're-- they're not wrong."
00:13:20.216,00:13:21.968,"They're just unusual, like willful with one L and..."
00:13:22.009,00:13:24.095,"Analyze with the S, not a Z."
00:13:24.137,00:13:29.058,"Plus the numbered paragraphs, numbered end notes, a corrections page, works-cited pages..."
00:13:29.100,00:13:30.893,-Okay.
00:13:30.935,00:13:32.853,Okay. Okay.
00:13:32.895,00:13:34.897,-I don't know.
00:13:34.939,00:13:36.857,"Dude, what do you want?"
00:13:36.899,00:13:38.901,We've been looking for wudder.
00:13:38.943,00:13:41.655,"I mean, it's an awesome idea."
00:13:41.696,00:13:43.657,But discretion is the better part of valor.
00:13:43.698,00:13:45.492,I don't want to be the next stamp guy.
00:13:45.533,00:13:52.873,"I mean, he's off interviewing Eugene O'Neill's grandkids' dog walker, and his career is over because he didn't know when to say uncle."
00:14:05.386,00:14:07.514,Maybe we should call in the experts.
00:14:11.601,00:14:13.852,"the, uh, San Diego thing?"
00:14:13.894,00:14:16.314,-I'm not going.
00:14:16.356,00:14:20.694,"Thank you all for coming, for taking the time to read the manifesto."
00:14:20.735,00:14:26.783,You've all been asked here today because you were either cited in the manifesto or you work in a related academic field.
00:14:26.825,00:14:31.912,"Look, I'm just-- I'm hoping that you can shed some light on who the author is based on what you read."
00:14:31.954,00:14:40.880,"Are there things that you recognize in the ideas, in the language, you know, from someone that you work with, a colleague or former student maybe?"
00:14:40.921,00:14:44.342,"If one of my students wrote this, he'd be out of the program."
00:14:44.384,00:14:46.886,There's no way this guy would pass peer review.
00:14:51.974,00:14:56.979,"The, uh, work coming out of your department hasn't been publishable in 20 years."
00:14:57.021,00:14:59.566,"-Oh, please."
00:14:59.607,00:15:01.442,-Excuse me.
00:15:03.528,00:15:05.029,Excuse me.
00:15:05.071,00:15:08.908,Was there a corrections page appended to the front?
00:15:09.992,00:15:13.621,-Yeah.
00:15:13.663,00:15:15.707,Was it in English or Latin?
00:15:15.749,00:15:20.336,Leave it to the comparative linguistics grad student to focus on what's relevant.
00:15:20.378,00:15:22.296,"You know, the Unabomber had one thing right."
00:15:22.338,00:15:24.924,Did you all read paragraph 88?
00:15:25.508,00:15:34.058,"Some scientific work has no conceivable relation to the welfare of the human race, comparative linguistics, for example."
00:15:34.100,00:15:37.395,your work is relevant?
00:15:42.817,00:15:44.736,"Oh, well, listen to the poli-sci..."
00:15:46.780,00:15:49.407,when you're having fun.
00:15:49.449,00:15:52.285,"So, who do we see about our per diem?"
00:15:52.326,00:15:54.704,Front desk.
00:15:59.626,00:16:03.003,"Fitz, good stuff today?"
00:16:03.045,00:16:05.005,Fill me in first thing tomorrow.
00:16:05.047,00:16:06.758,-Yeah.
00:16:06.800,00:16:08.008,You can get your per diem at the front desk.
00:16:08.050,00:16:10.470,"No, no. It's not that."
00:16:10.511,00:16:13.013,My question was never answered.
00:16:13.055,00:16:15.975,Is it Corrections or Errata?
00:16:18.311,00:16:20.730,"It's, uh, Corrections."
00:16:20.772,00:16:22.022,Why?
00:16:22.690,00:16:24.108,Come look at the format.
00:16:24.150,00:16:27.027,-It's weird.
00:16:27.069,00:16:34.076,"To me, these numbered paragraphs, the numbered end notes, and the corrections page, I mean, this is a dissertation."
00:16:34.118,00:16:36.245,This is standard formatting for a PhD.
00:16:36.287,00:16:38.998,-I asked everyone about the formatting.
00:16:39.039,00:16:41.167,Modern dissertations look totally different now.
00:16:41.208,00:16:43.085,The word processor changed everything.
00:16:43.127,00:16:46.005,This is in the style of an older graduate thesis paper.
00:16:46.046,00:16:54.054,"I noticed these kind of things, and this style of end notes was only used before 1972-ish, -when they changed to footnotes."
00:16:54.096,00:16:58.392,It was called errata before 1967.
00:16:58.434,00:17:01.270,Meaning he learned the formatting between '67 and '72.
00:17:01.312,00:17:02.689,More than that.
00:17:02.730,00:17:04.524,Only PhD candidates used this style.
00:17:04.565,00:17:07.151,So if he's still using this format 20 years later...
00:17:07.193,00:17:08.945,He must have written a dissertation.
00:17:08.987,00:17:12.949,He must have written a dissertation -between '67 and '72.
00:17:12.991,00:17:19.330,"-Comparative linguistics, not as useless as the Unabomber thinks."
00:17:20.581,00:17:22.667,Do you have a minute?
00:17:26.128,00:17:31.091,"supposed to see this, but..."
00:17:32.719,00:17:39.058,"We've been analyzing the language of the manifesto, looking for clues as to who he is."
00:17:39.851,00:17:41.227,Wow.
00:17:41.268,00:17:45.690,"We've been looking for mistakes on the theory that, well, like, I say wudder and, um..."
00:17:45.732,00:17:50.570,Idiolect. It's what we call the speech patterns of one specific person.
00:17:50.611,00:17:53.113,"Idiolect, right."
00:17:53.155,00:17:56.701,"Um, it's like a linguistic fingerprint."
00:17:56.743,00:17:59.203,"I mean, we'll work out who he is by..."
00:18:01.163,00:18:03.457,So you've been looking for mistakes.
00:18:03.499,00:18:05.752,Right.
00:18:05.793,00:18:08.128,-Except they're not mistakes.
00:18:08.170,00:18:10.006,They're variant spellings.
00:18:10.048,00:18:12.466,"They're unusual, but they're technically correct."
00:18:12.759,00:18:14.134,And is he consistent?
00:18:14.176,00:18:16.136,He uses the same spellings every time?
00:18:16.178,00:18:19.306,"Yeah, letters, manifesto-- it's the same unusual spelling."
00:18:21.726,00:18:24.729,"Is this totally amateur? Like, am I-- am I doing all right?"
00:18:24.771,00:18:28.066,-Am I?
00:18:28.107,00:18:29.943,Using language to solve crimes?
00:18:29.984,00:18:32.528,There's not even a name for what you're doing.
00:18:32.570,00:18:44.206,"So if he's consistent, that suggests a style guide, you know, somewhere where he learned to spell this way, a newspaper, magazine, somewhere that had a style guide for their editors that matches these spellings."
00:18:44.248,00:18:46.166,And if we can find that style guide...
00:18:46.208,00:18:47.543,We're closer to finding his idiolect.
00:18:47.585,00:18:49.545,And if we can find his idiolect...
00:18:49.587,00:18:51.338,Then we find the Unabomber.
00:18:51.380,00:18:53.173,Yes.
00:18:58.220,00:19:00.180,-That's it?
00:19:00.222,00:19:02.725,The obsolete style guide sections are pretty thin.
00:19:02.767,00:19:06.395,I could start hitting the local public libraries in Marin County today if you want to.
00:19:07.313,00:19:09.523,Just keep reading.
00:19:09.565,00:19:11.400,"This is crazy, man."
00:19:11.442,00:19:14.570,"Needle in a haystack for what, a few spelling mistakes?"
00:19:14.612,00:19:17.197,It's not mistakes.
00:19:21.285,00:19:22.912,It's just Ackerman.
00:19:22.954,00:19:25.205,"He wants us to brief him, but we got nothing to present."
00:19:25.247,00:19:26.666,He'll be fine.
00:19:31.253,00:19:33.255,-Hello?
00:19:33.297,00:19:36.050,Just tell him I'm on my way.
00:19:36.092,00:19:38.218,"Dude, it's some woman for you."
00:19:45.392,00:19:46.727,Hey!
00:19:46.769,00:19:48.228,I found it.
00:19:48.270,00:19:51.691,"The Chicago Tribune, it's their in-house style guide."
00:19:51.732,00:19:57.279,"Their publisher, Robert McCormick, was this big proponent of this fringe simplified spelling movement."
00:19:57.321,00:19:59.448,"In 1949, he forced it on his editors."
00:19:59.490,00:20:02.785,"In 1954, when he died, they switched back to standard spelling."
00:20:02.827,00:20:06.288,-Analyse. Wilfuly.
00:20:06.330,00:20:08.457,Instalment with one L.
00:20:08.499,00:20:10.250,This is it.
00:20:10.292,00:20:13.046,Yes.
00:20:13.087,00:20:14.714,Thank you.
00:20:15.297,00:20:16.549,-Fitz?
00:20:16.590,00:20:18.676,It started.
00:20:18.718,00:20:27.267,"So from that initial subject pool of 15 million, we put additional parameters on the M.P.P., which narrowed it to 2,500."
00:20:27.309,00:20:30.312,We're calling that our Tier 3 subject group.
00:20:30.354,00:20:39.739,"Tier 2-- subjects with criminal records, mechanical or explosives training, in a nexus between Salt Lake City and the Bay Area."
00:20:39.780,00:20:41.615,Tier 1-- top 20.
00:20:41.657,00:20:45.786,High level of confidence that one of these guys is our man.
00:20:45.828,00:20:52.585,"They're all under active surveillance, or they're at large, being sought by Special Operations Group."
00:20:52.626,00:20:54.461,Excellent.
00:20:54.503,00:21:02.178,"Fitz, have you got, uh, anything from those nutty professors that can move the needle?"
00:21:02.220,00:21:03.596,"Actually, yes."
00:21:03.637,00:21:11.104,We have solid linguistic evidence that he grew up in Chicago and that he learned his spelling and grammar from the Chicago Tribune.
00:21:11.145,00:21:13.313,And how solid is this?
00:21:13.355,00:21:15.274,Solid.
00:21:15.315,00:21:17.401,You just made somebody very happy.
00:21:17.443,00:21:21.989,Confirmed something that I've been saying.
00:21:22.322,00:21:25.325,"Leo Frederick Burt, born in Chicago."
00:21:26.368,00:21:28.328,Pass these around.
00:21:28.370,00:21:31.331,"Leo Burt, my pick for suspect number one."
00:21:31.373,00:21:35.294,"Born and raised in Chicago, flirted with S.D.S."
00:21:32.792,00:21:56.065,"and the Panthers before joining a radical weather underground splinter group, involved in a series of anti-establishment attacks in the late '70s, including-- drumroll, please-- three attempted bombings, went into hiding around the same time that the Unabomber started his attacks, and, plus, as you can see, he's a dead ringer for the sketch."
00:21:56.107,00:21:58.151,"You want to add anything to that, Fitz?"
00:21:58.192,00:22:07.576,"Well, it's also likely that he had a university affiliation, you know, that the previous profile suggested little or no college-- is music to my ears today."
00:22:07.618,00:22:09.620,He went to University of Wisconsin-Madison.
00:22:09.662,00:22:12.372,That's where he got hooked up with the radical groups.
00:22:12.414,00:22:15.168,All right.
00:22:15.209,00:22:18.129,and start re-interviewing all known associates.
00:22:18.171,00:22:22.382,Let's see if we can drag Leo Burt out of hiding.
00:22:22.424,00:22:25.511,"Awesome work, guys."
00:22:25.552,00:22:27.387,Get you involved in that Tier 1 squad.
00:22:27.429,00:22:29.598,"Just a second, before everyone goes."
00:22:29.640,00:22:32.268,-Um...
00:22:32.310,00:22:33.560,"Fitz, leave it be."
00:22:35.437,00:22:37.231,How old is Leo Burt?
00:22:38.398,00:22:41.235,"Forty-seven, born 1948."
00:22:41.777,00:22:43.570,He's too young.
00:22:43.612,00:22:45.281,-He's possibly too young.
00:22:45.323,00:22:47.783,He learned his spelling between '49 and-- and '54.
00:22:47.825,00:22:51.411,"He got a PhD between, you know, '67 and '72."
00:22:51.453,00:22:54.665,So we're looking at someone who's minimum of 50 years old.
00:22:54.707,00:22:58.711,"Plus, if he's got an affiliation with the Black Panthers, then he wouldn't use the word Negro."
00:22:58.752,00:23:02.798,So it's not him.
00:23:05.801,00:23:08.346,"I'm gonna take college, and I'm gonna take Chicago."
00:23:08.386,00:23:10.056,-I'm gonna forget the rest.
00:23:10.097,00:23:12.390,You can't do that.
00:23:12.725,00:23:14.601,That's three robust data points.
00:23:14.643,00:23:16.062,"Plus, the Unabomber got a doctorate."
00:23:16.103,00:23:17.730,He didn't just spend a little time in college.
00:23:17.771,00:23:19.481,He got a PhD.
00:23:19.523,00:23:23.443,Okay!
00:23:23.485,00:23:25.071,That's it.
00:23:27.573,00:23:28.991,What's this based on?
00:23:29.033,00:23:34.454,"The Unabomber's idiolect, his use of language, -the formatting, his spelling."
00:23:34.496,00:23:36.749,Goddamn spelling?
00:23:36.790,00:23:40.460,Every serial bomber in history started between 18 and 21.
00:23:40.502,00:23:43.130,That puts his age between 35 and 45.
00:23:43.172,00:23:44.798,"Well, maybe he's the exception to the rule."
00:23:44.840,00:23:48.468,"Every profiler that we've had in here, including -- Go back to your desks, both of you!"
00:23:48.510,00:23:53.099,"If you want a seat at this table, you put names on that board!"
00:23:53.140,00:23:57.853,Your job is not to tell me to burn a month's work over Goddamn spelling!
00:24:06.904,00:24:08.488,What the hell is wrong with you?
00:24:08.530,00:24:10.366,"They're just so blinded, they can't see."
00:24:10.408,00:24:13.286,"They're blinded? Dude, you just turned a promotion into a freaking Kamikaze mission."
00:24:13.327,00:24:14.703,"No, no, no."
00:24:14.745,00:24:16.330,That's what I'm trying to do.
00:24:16.372,00:24:19.250,"You know, they can run the M.P.P. all month long, but garbage in, garbage out."
00:24:19.292,00:24:20.500,"They got 2,000 subjects."
00:24:20.542,00:24:21.961,"Well, how can you be so sure they're wrong?"
00:24:22.002,00:24:22.920,We don't even know what we're doing.
00:24:22.962,00:24:24.504,We're making this up as we go.
00:24:24.546,00:24:26.506,"Yeah, yeah."
00:24:26.548,00:24:27.633,-Maybe.
00:24:27.674,00:24:30.303,Maybe we're wrong.
00:24:30.344,00:24:32.388,"I mean, I'm flunking out of Intro to Psych."
00:24:32.430,00:24:34.472,You have a night school degree in an unrelated field.
00:24:34.514,00:24:37.810,-Doesn't mean that...
00:24:38.560,00:24:40.520,I know that we're right.
00:24:40.562,00:24:42.898,Okay. You want to stake your career on that?
00:24:42.940,00:24:45.734,You go ahead. You leave me the hell out of it.
00:24:51.949,00:24:52.908,Seriously?
00:24:52.950,00:24:55.619,They're sending me back to the lab.
00:24:55.661,00:24:57.495,It's been real.
00:25:11.385,00:25:13.511,Thanks for staying up.
00:25:19.893,00:25:22.104,There is a silver lining.
00:25:22.688,00:25:28.861,"Yeah. I, uh-- I found a dictionary of phrases, and I've been reading about eat your cake and have it, too."
00:25:29.569,00:25:30.821,"Have your cake and eat it, too."
00:25:30.863,00:25:32.906,"See, that's the thing."
00:25:32.948,00:25:34.783,It is actually the other way around.
00:25:34.825,00:25:36.785,"Sometime in the 1500s, it got switched around."
00:25:36.827,00:25:38.912,And we've been saying it wrong ever since.
00:25:41.623,00:25:44.251,"So, why are you telling me this?"
00:25:45.836,00:25:47.671,How was today?
00:25:50.257,00:25:53.760,Dan burned his tongue.
00:25:57.681,00:26:02.311,I went. I stayed.
00:26:04.646,00:26:06.606,"Well, I love you."
00:26:07.649,00:26:09.567,I love you.
00:26:26.210,00:26:29.629,"and having it, too, in that order."
00:26:33.133,00:26:36.387,"There's something so tragic about him, isn't there?"
00:26:36.429,00:26:41.599,"A guy who could write like that, think like that, so much insight and passion?"
00:26:41.641,00:26:47.856,"And yet, somehow, his life turned out in such a way that he thinks the only way he can get people to hear what he has to say is by blowing people up?"
00:26:47.898,00:26:51.651,"Well, if he was trapped, ignored, powerless..."
00:26:51.693,00:26:57.324,"it's about being powerless, but, really, it's about being so terribly lonely."
00:26:57.366,00:27:02.955,"It's about having just one person that he can talk to who understands him, who respects him for who he is."
00:27:04.706,00:27:07.000,"That's what anyone wants, right?"
00:27:09.962,00:27:12.965,-There you go.
00:27:13.006,00:27:15.551,This is the Venn diagram of nachos?
00:27:17.344,00:27:25.643,"You have the jalapeño zone to the North, the bean zone to the West, salsa zone to the East, and at the center, it's the Pripyat River Valley."
00:27:28.730,00:27:32.692,"It's just some linguistics humor-- you know, the Slavic homeland."
00:27:32.734,00:27:34.987,-Huh?
00:27:35.028,00:27:37.072,"You know, it's just this weird, dorky thing."
00:27:37.114,00:27:40.658,Go on.
00:27:42.119,00:27:43.537,Okay.
00:27:43.579,00:27:54.714,"So, around the year 600, Slavic people suddenly appeared all over Europe-- you know, Germany, Poland, Serbia, Russia-- but nobody could figure out where they came from."
00:27:54.756,00:27:56.049,-The Slavic homeland.
00:27:56.091,00:28:06.684,"It was this huge historical mystery until they started looking at language, and then they realized that Proto-Slavic was missing words for certain kinds of trees."
00:28:06.726,00:28:12.191,"You know, they had to borrow words for oak and beech and pine and..."
00:28:18.780,00:28:22.909,"The Slavs are everywhere, but they don't have a word for jalapeños."
00:28:22.951,00:28:25.663,-So they can't come from here?
00:28:25.703,00:28:32.919,"And they have no word for beans or salsa or sour cream, which eliminates everywhere but here."
00:28:34.796,00:28:39.009,It's basically this huge swamp-- the one place in Europe where there are no trees.
00:28:39.051,00:28:39.926,Right.
00:28:41.261,00:28:47.351,"because, up until then, they had only been looking at the words that they had, and the key was in the words that they didn't have."
00:28:47.393,00:28:49.102,-What they didn't say...
00:28:49.144,00:28:51.897,...what they didn't know how to say.
00:28:53.940,00:28:57.570,What they didn't know how to say.
00:28:57.611,00:28:59.863,Right.
00:28:59.905,00:29:02.658,-Go.
00:29:02.700,00:29:04.784,-Go.
00:29:04.826,00:29:06.203,-Yeah.
00:29:24.096,00:29:27.725,So what don't you talk about?
00:29:31.853,00:29:36.816,"Wife, children, family-- you don't talk about them."
00:29:40.862,00:29:42.322,Work?
00:29:42.364,00:29:45.409,"Don't talk about a job, coworkers."
00:29:45.451,00:29:47.453,Friends-- you don't have any friends.
00:29:47.494,00:29:51.248,"You got no one to talk to, no one to listen to."
00:29:51.873,00:29:58.255,"And no computer, TVs, no pop culture."
00:29:59.005,00:30:05.845,"So, no IBM, G.E., G.M., Xerox, Dell-- you haven't heard of any of them."
00:30:08.932,00:30:10.768,You're cut off.
00:30:14.854,00:30:19.151,"No black people, no women."
00:30:21.945,00:30:24.782,You had a phone.
00:30:24.823,00:30:26.241,"You wrote, Call Nathan R."
00:30:29.536,00:30:31.830,You are out there.
00:30:33.915,00:30:35.875,You're somewhere beyond.
00:30:40.005,00:30:42.382,Isolated.
00:30:44.760,00:30:46.595,This is it.
00:30:48.514,00:30:51.141,This is your homeland... here...
00:30:52.518,00:30:57.230,"...where there's nobody, where there's nothing."
00:31:17.959,00:31:19.919,"Well, this is nice."
00:31:19.961,00:31:22.255,"You don't change, do you, Fitz?"
00:31:22.297,00:31:25.467,Just a little less subtle this time.
00:31:27.553,00:31:31.931,"so he could attack the search warrant, attack my forensic linguistics work."
00:31:31.973,00:31:34.893,"So what? Your work is solid, and it worked."
00:31:35.561,00:31:37.103,It doesn't matter.
00:31:35.561,00:31:38.564,It doesn't matter 'cause they're gonna put me on the stand.
00:31:38.605,00:31:41.024,They're gonna tear me apart 'cause I don't have a PhD.
00:31:41.066,00:31:42.860,I'm not gonna be humiliated in front of the whole bureau.
00:31:42.901,00:31:45.278,Stop with the self-pity.
00:31:45.320,00:31:48.782,Who cares what the bureau thinks?
00:31:48.824,00:31:52.952,They don't care about you unless they want something from you.
00:31:52.994,00:32:03.213,"What we had, what we discovered, the work, at least, was special, and it was right."
00:32:03.255,00:32:14.307,"You are more than this case, Fitz, even if you don't believe it, even if they never give you credit for it."
00:32:14.349,00:32:17.436,"That has to mean something, right?"
00:32:18.812,00:32:20.689,What was that about credit?
00:32:21.565,00:32:24.984,Credit-- that is the way back in. Ted wants to be famous.
00:32:25.026,00:32:26.986,He wants everyone to know how smart he is.
00:32:27.028,00:32:29.531,The only way he's gonna get the credit is to plead guilty.
00:32:31.116,00:32:33.368,You bet the farm once before that he'd need a trophy.
00:32:33.410,00:32:34.745,-This is different.
00:32:34.787,00:32:36.955,This is different.
00:32:36.996,00:32:40.333,"You can convince me all night, but there's no way Cole will let you in there."
00:32:43.336,00:32:44.963,I'll go on my own.
00:32:45.505,00:32:47.758,Make the call.
00:32:48.216,00:32:50.009,"It'll be off the record, just me and Ted, face-to-face."
00:32:50.051,00:32:52.220,I'll make-- I'll make it right.
00:32:52.262,00:32:53.680,Make the call.
00:32:55.432,00:32:57.559,Make the call.
00:33:11.072,00:33:13.116,I'm off the case.
00:33:13.158,00:33:15.076,I'm going home.
00:33:20.081,00:33:22.626,There's one thing I would like to ask you before I leave.
00:33:30.258,00:33:35.054,"Did you do all this because you wanted to make a difference in the world, to change things?"
00:33:35.096,00:33:38.057,That's what I admired about you.
00:33:38.099,00:33:47.776,"You know, I admired you so much, I gave up everything to live like you-- alone in the woods, manifesto under my bed."
00:33:47.818,00:33:50.111,Is that true?
00:33:53.114,00:33:55.826,"When you asked for me, I came, right?"
00:33:55.868,00:33:58.495,Yeah.
00:33:58.537,00:34:02.040,can change the world.
00:34:02.415,00:34:05.043,Now you're gonna throw it all away.
00:34:05.084,00:34:08.129,I'm not throwing anything away.
00:34:08.964,00:34:10.340,I'm beating the system at its own game.
00:34:10.382,00:34:11.591,That's the whole point.
00:34:11.633,00:34:14.469,"Well, getting the search warrant tossed out is beating the system."
00:34:14.511,00:34:16.179,But what about after?
00:34:17.389,00:34:18.849,"Oh, you mean after."
00:34:18.891,00:34:27.858,"Well, I-- I walk away a free man, vindicated as the victim of your sloppy and inexpert police work."
00:34:28.734,00:34:31.110,forgetting a step?
00:34:31.152,00:34:35.908,"Before you walk free, you got to stand in front of a judge and say, I'm not guilty."
00:34:37.158,00:34:40.203,I'm not the Unabomber.
00:34:37.158,00:34:41.997,"I didn't write the manifesto, didn't elude the F.B.I."
00:34:42.039,00:34:45.625,I'm just a nobody who stands for nothing.
00:34:45.667,00:34:47.085,No.
00:34:48.169,00:34:50.964,"See, your-- your logic is flawed."
00:34:52.173,00:34:56.135,"I'm gonna be acquitted on a technicality, not on the merits of the case."
00:34:56.177,00:34:59.138,I won't be saying that I'm not the Unabomber.
00:34:59.848,00:35:05.020,"You say that on TV, then people who admire you, like me, are just gonna think you're a hypocrite."
00:35:05.478,00:35:07.564,You're just betraying your own principles to save your own skin.
00:35:07.606,00:35:09.691,"No, you got to stand up."
00:35:09.733,00:35:11.401,You got to take ownership of what you wrote.
00:35:11.443,00:35:14.153,"Otherwise, your legacy, the manifesto will vanish."
00:35:14.195,00:35:20.869,"The manifesto will not vanish because the manifesto has been published, and more importantly, the manifesto happens to be right."
00:35:20.911,00:35:22.161,if it's right.
00:35:22.203,00:35:25.624,"People don't believe in you, they won't believe in the manifesto."
00:35:25.665,00:35:36.843,"Are you, one man, doing it all alone, or are you a leader of men, a man who can change the world, who can make a difference and can leave a legacy behind?"
00:35:37.218,00:35:39.304,Because you can't be both.
00:35:40.847,00:35:43.433,"Can't eat your cake and have it, too, Ted."
00:35:45.978,00:35:49.147,"What about you, Fitz?"
00:35:49.188,00:35:51.190,What's your legacy?
00:35:54.945,00:35:58.824,"My family, my sons, they're my legacy."
00:35:58.865,00:36:00.450,out in the woods with you?
00:36:00.492,00:36:02.953,-Mnh-mnh. No. They weren't.
00:36:02.995,00:36:04.203,So why do you think you said that?
00:36:04.245,00:36:06.123,Why do you think you're lying to me?
00:36:06.164,00:36:07.499,It's complicated.
00:36:07.540,00:36:09.584,It's not complicated.
00:36:09.626,00:36:12.420,They're not your legacy.
00:36:13.338,00:36:14.631,You're not my legacy.
00:36:14.673,00:36:18.217,because catching me is the only meaningful thing you've ever accomplished.
00:36:18.259,00:36:20.512,"And now I'm gonna walk, you can feel it slipping away."
00:36:20.553,00:36:23.473,"If you walk, you will lose all respect."
00:36:24.223,00:36:26.518,Are you talking about me or you?
00:36:28.020,00:36:36.235,"Because, see, it's you that spent your whole life desperate for respect, desperate to prove that you're smarter than the people around you, and for a brief moment, you were."
00:36:36.277,00:36:38.780,You were the guy that caught the Unabomber.
00:36:39.280,00:36:47.246,"But I'm about to walk, and the whole world will see that you are just a knuckle-dragging beat cop, and the graffiti squad was where you belonged."
00:36:47.288,00:37:11.021,"You know, the thing I find most sad about you, James, is that you can run off and live in the woods, abandoning your wife and kids, study the manifesto down to the letter, but it will not make one jot of difference to anyone, and the best that you will ever be is a feeble imitation of me."
00:37:53.855,00:37:56.357,about Leo Burt.
00:37:56.399,00:37:59.277,"He's our best suspect, but he's also our most elusive."
00:38:00.653,00:38:05.825,"Uh, Fitz, uh, you weren't on the list for this meeting, so if we need you, we will give you a buzz."
00:38:05.867,00:38:09.037,This is a new profile.
00:38:09.079,00:38:10.663,"Goodbye, Fitz."
00:38:13.208,00:38:15.043,Just trying to help.
00:38:15.085,00:38:17.336,This is based on what exactly?
00:38:17.378,00:38:18.755,Forensics.
00:38:18.797,00:38:21.174,-Forensics?
00:38:18.797,00:38:22.675,-I've come up with an approach I'm calling forensic linguistics.
00:38:22.717,00:38:24.636,are forensics.
00:38:24.677,00:38:26.345,DNA is forensics.
00:38:26.387,00:38:28.890,Spelling willfully with one L is not forensics.
00:38:28.932,00:38:31.768,It's not just spelling.
00:38:31.810,00:38:35.480,"Fitz, we don't want a profile."
00:38:35.521,00:38:38.024,Can you get us a person that we can put on the board?
00:38:38.066,00:38:40.652,-I think if you just read it...
00:38:40.693,00:38:44.405,Give me a name that I can put on the board.
00:38:44.447,00:38:47.826,"Otherwise, shut the door behind you."
00:38:57.418,00:38:59.337,Toss that thing.
00:39:04.009,00:39:05.384,Okay. Where were we?
00:39:05.426,00:39:08.513,"We've got the top five, counting Leo Burt."
00:39:21.442,00:39:23.402,ship.
00:39:23.444,00:39:26.281,Got to make them hear you.
00:39:46.384,00:39:50.429,You're gonna make them listen.
00:39:54.684,00:39:56.186,How?
00:39:57.478,00:39:58.396,How?
00:40:01.524,00:40:03.818,-Who's my liaison?
00:40:06.487,00:40:08.365,everything else.
00:40:08.406,00:40:09.490,This is all hands on deck.
00:40:09.532,00:40:11.284,Copy that. We're on it.
00:40:11.326,00:40:12.827,Get the originals down to forensics.
00:40:12.869,00:40:14.079,Follow me.
00:40:26.507,00:40:30.345,They're from him.
00:40:47.404,00:40:49.364,"Jesus, I'm gonna go get him."
00:40:59.874,00:41:02.627,Why didn't you answer my pages?
00:41:02.668,00:41:05.422,We just got a bunch of new Unabom letters.
00:41:05.463,00:41:09.550,"He's written to The Times, the Washington Post, Penthouse."
00:41:09.592,00:41:11.594,You're not gonna believe this.
00:41:11.636,00:41:14.472,The Unabomber wants to make a deal.
00:41:30.280,00:41:34.075,"Well, what the hell do we do now?"
00:00:19.687,00:00:23.273,Ted: This is a message from the terrorist group FC.
00:00:23.315,00:00:29.947,"To prove its authenticity, we give our identifying number as 553254394."
00:00:29.989,00:00:33.074,"To The New York Times, we are offering a bargain."
00:00:33.116,00:00:39.080,"If you publish our manifesto, we will permanently desist from all terrorist activities."
00:00:39.122,00:00:46.755,The killer known as the Unabomber says he will stop mailing package bombs if the newspapers will publish his political theories.
00:00:46.797,00:00:52.093,"Ted: As I'm sure you know, bombs may attract attention, but ideas start revolutions."
00:00:52.135,00:00:58.976,"That is our sole aim, and if we break our word, people will lose respect for us and be less likely to accept our ideas."
00:00:59.018,00:01:03.146,"The question now is, can the word of a serial killer be trusted?"
00:01:03.188,00:01:05.315,But what have we learned from the LAX incident?
00:01:05.357,00:01:08.861,"His reputation is the most important thing to him, so if he says he'll stop bombing, he'll stop bombing."
00:01:08.903,00:01:12.031,The United States government does not negotiate with terrorists.
00:01:12.072,00:01:13.699,This is how we catch him.
00:01:13.741,00:01:18.620,"If we publish, someone will recognize his idiolect, his ideology, or both."
00:01:18.662,00:01:20.998,You haven't got a fingerprint in 17 years.
00:01:21.040,00:01:23.124,He just gave us a linguistic fingerprint on a silver platter.
00:01:23.166,00:01:26.754,Stan: The United States government does not negotiate with terrorists.
00:01:26.795,00:01:28.463,Ted: The FBI is a joke.
00:01:28.505,00:01:32.384,They've tried to portray these bombings as the work of an isolated nut.
00:01:32.426,00:01:36.597,"The so-called Unabomber, blamed for 16 attacks in 17 years, has now spoken out."
00:01:36.638,00:01:41.643,"In several letters, one to The New York Times, the bomber denounced the industrial society."
00:01:41.685,00:01:44.145,Jim: We publish the manifesto and use his plan against him.
00:01:44.187,00:01:46.065,We did publish the Zodiac Killer.
00:01:54.197,00:02:01.162,Ted: Our goal is less to punish the people pushing all this growth-and-progress garbage than it is to propagate ideas.
00:02:01.204,00:02:03.999,This outlines my whole case for publication.
00:02:04.041,00:02:06.627,"You can take it to Janet Reno, you can take it to FBI Director Freeh."
00:02:06.668,00:02:15.010,I'm supposed to walk into Janet Reno's office and ask her to publicly give in to the demands of a terrorist because someone might recognize his spelling?
00:02:15.052,00:02:23.060,"Ted: If our manifesto is not published by The New York Times or some other nationally distributed periodical, another bomb is ready to be delivered."
00:02:23.102,00:02:40.201,"This is Bob Guccione, I have been following your correspondence with The New York Times, and I believe your offer to desist from the bombing is genuine, so I am offering to immediately publish your article unedited and in full in Penthouse magazine."
00:02:40.243,00:02:43.204,Our demographic is virtually the same as The New York Times.
00:02:43.246,00:02:47.584,I might add we're the biggest-selling magazine in the Pentagon.
00:02:47.626,00:02:50.712,"Ted: Mr. Guccione, we are very pleased, and we thank you."
00:02:50.754,00:02:59.304,"While we don't have anything against sex magazines, it will obviously be to our advantage to be published in a respectable periodical."
00:02:59.346,00:03:06.227,"The New York Times is to have the first claim on the right to publish, then The Washington Post, and after that, Penthouse."
00:03:06.269,00:03:13.192,"However, if only Penthouse publishes, we reserve the right to plant one more deadly bomb."
00:03:18.782,00:03:21.576,"Sir, please consider the case for publication."
00:03:21.618,00:03:25.539,"He sends us a manifesto, and that was his first mistake, and we should exploit it for all it's worth."
00:03:25.580,00:03:32.253,"His first mistake actually was Nathan R., and as of 7:00 A.M."
00:03:30.293,00:03:34.464,"this morning, we have Nathan R."
00:03:34.506,00:03:38.259,"Nathan R., A.K.A. Nathan Robinson, out of San Jose."
00:03:38.301,00:03:44.058,"He's an old acquaintance of, guess who, Leo Frederick Burt, our current top suspect."
00:03:44.099,00:03:46.810,Our S.O.G. teams are hunting down Robinson right now.
00:03:46.852,00:03:52.399,"He's been charged with terroristic threatening of a peace officer, possession of narcotics, mail fraud."
00:03:52.440,00:03:55.861,"We put a tail on him, there's a pretty good chance he's going to lead us to Leo Burt."
00:03:55.903,00:03:58.279,The linguistic evidence eliminated Leo Burt.
00:03:58.321,00:03:59.865,"Okay, Fitz."
00:03:59.907,00:04:03.284,"You've said your peace, but we don't negotiate with terrorists."
00:04:03.326,00:04:05.537,"Genelli, get to New York."
00:04:05.579,00:04:09.624,I'll be in Washington with Director Freeh and Janet Reno.
00:04:09.666,00:04:12.335,"That's it, folks."
00:05:06.974,00:05:08.349,"Woman: Mia, look at that."
00:05:08.391,00:05:09.726,"I mean, it really sparkles, right?"
00:05:09.768,00:05:13.354,-And it is setting -- -Hey.
00:05:13.396,00:05:16.608,Wow.
00:05:16.650,00:05:18.526,Wow.
00:05:18.568,00:05:24.365,"You know, this job, they're always saying, If you guys have all the answers, why haven't we caught him by now?"
00:05:24.407,00:05:28.287,"It's, like, wake up."
00:05:28.328,00:05:30.371,"Well, it's not all bad."
00:05:30.413,00:05:31.372,-No?
00:05:31.414,00:05:34.375,-Because?
00:05:34.417,00:05:42.009,it's after 5:00 and I'm finally here and there are no kids anywhere.
00:05:50.600,00:05:52.727,"Beth: Well, he's just a kid."
00:05:52.769,00:05:56.397,It's easy to get passionate about something and not realize you're wrong.
00:05:56.439,00:05:59.985,"He's not really a kid, and he's not wrong, exactly."
00:06:03.446,00:06:05.406,He's got no big picture.
00:06:05.448,00:06:08.243,"So, what do you think?"
00:06:09.452,00:06:11.370,"This is it, Beth."
00:06:11.412,00:06:12.956,This case is the one.
00:06:12.998,00:06:15.709,"This is how I'm going to be remembered, it's going to be my legacy."
00:06:15.750,00:06:18.419,There's so much you'll be remembered for.
00:06:18.461,00:06:22.049,"Eh, I could lock up a million serial killers."
00:06:22.090,00:06:24.801,But I'll always be the guy that led Unabom.
00:06:24.843,00:06:27.554,"Yeah, that's me."
00:06:27.595,00:06:30.098,"The Scarlet U, huh?"
00:06:30.140,00:06:31.432,Sweetie.
00:06:31.474,00:06:34.477,"It's a buzzer shot, and I only get one."
00:06:34.519,00:06:38.273,Sometimes I just wish I could...
00:06:38.315,00:06:40.441,pass the damn ball to the next guy.
00:06:40.483,00:06:43.362,There's no glory but no catastrophe.
00:06:43.402,00:06:45.989,Just the path of least resistance.
00:06:47.908,00:06:50.035,"Terrible, huh?"
00:06:50.077,00:06:52.453,It's weak.
00:06:52.495,00:06:54.998,"But, boy..."
00:06:55.040,00:06:56.499,I think about it.
00:07:04.716,00:07:09.846,"Woman: Director Freeh, S.A.C. Ackerman, Attorney General Reno will be with you shortly."
00:07:09.888,00:07:12.349,Freeh: Thank you.
00:07:14.976,00:07:17.604,"Don, listen."
00:07:17.645,00:07:19.940,You're just telling her what she wants to hear.
00:07:19.981,00:07:23.484,-Don't publish a terrorist.
00:07:23.526,00:07:26.696,-And you've got a ton more where that came from.
00:07:26.738,00:07:30.367,All of the Tier 1 guys are solid.
00:07:30.409,00:07:31.826,Yeah.
00:07:31.868,00:07:35.622,"Listen, you inherited a garbage case."
00:07:35.663,00:07:37.665,No one expects a miracle.
00:07:57.102,00:07:59.354,"Genelli, it's Ackerman."
00:07:59.396,00:08:02.649,"I'm at The New York Times, and I have some bad news."
00:08:02.690,00:08:09.364,"It's okay, we'll -- we'll be fine, but I got here early for my meeting with Sulzberger."
00:08:09.406,00:08:13.534,There was this mail-room guy.
00:08:13.576,00:08:15.536,You know the call Nathan R.
00:08:13.576,00:08:19.916,note that was indented writing on the envelope the Unabomber sent The Times?
00:08:19.958,00:08:26.965,"Well, this mail-room guy handles every letter that comes to The Times, and he's really into post-its."
00:08:27.007,00:08:33.138,That Unabom letter came to The New York Times mail room before it got to us.
00:08:33.180,00:08:38.852,"That indented writing was made by Reggie Halender, mail intern here at The Times."
00:08:38.893,00:08:42.439,The Unabomber didn't write the Nathan R. Note.
00:08:42.481,00:08:44.524,There is no Nathan R.
00:08:46.776,00:08:52.573,You're telling me that we've been chasing a dead lead for the last two years?
00:08:52.615,00:08:53.783,Andy: Yeah.
00:08:53.825,00:08:57.120,How many Nathan R.s have we been -- Andy: I know. Sorry.
00:08:57.162,00:08:59.289,Goddamn it.
00:09:12.469,00:09:14.595,This doesn't change anything.
00:09:14.637,00:09:16.723,She wants broad strokes.
00:09:16.764,00:09:18.599,Just de-emphasize Nathan R.
00:09:18.641,00:09:21.311,and focus on Burt and the other top-tier leads.
00:09:27.317,00:09:42.082,"This whole miniature war-gaming thing has officially taken over the dining room table, and Sean's really territorial about it, and I can't even suggest that he move it without him freaking out."
00:09:42.123,00:09:43.583,You think I should learn the game?
00:09:43.624,00:09:45.168,I think I should learn the game.
00:09:45.210,00:09:48.505,I think you've got quite enough games in your life already.
00:09:52.592,00:09:55.970,It's not how I want it to be.
00:09:56.012,00:10:00.641,"Look, when I said that, I just meant..."
00:10:00.683,00:10:03.686,"I know. I know, but you're right."
00:10:09.192,00:10:11.403,I might as well be playing a game.
00:10:11.445,00:10:18.659,"My work has hit a dead end, so I'm going to ask Genelli, because I think it's time for me to come home."
00:10:18.701,00:10:21.621,"Oh, love, I didn't..."
00:10:21.662,00:10:24.458,That's not why I came here.
00:10:24.499,00:10:31.256,"I mean, I would be so, so happy to be a family again, but..."
00:10:31.298,00:10:33.716,I just want to feel like I'm making a difference.
00:10:45.520,00:10:47.730,"-Hey, it's Fitz."
00:10:45.520,00:10:50.942,- You've got 30 minutes to come up with something better than forensic linguistics.
00:10:50.984,00:10:56.906,"Nathan R. is a dead end, but language is not enough here."
00:11:05.499,00:11:10.711,"if I do, if, then both our asses are on the line."
00:11:10.753,00:11:12.046,Do you understand me?
00:11:13.756,00:11:14.882,You two brainstorm.
00:11:14.924,00:11:17.344,"You be brilliant, quickly."
00:11:17.385,00:11:19.262,You've got 29 minutes.
00:11:26.060,00:11:27.854,Stan: Concrete and operational.
00:11:27.895,00:11:36.029,"Okay, we know he likes code, so if we embed a code in a publication, we can lure him in to a conversation -- I said concrete and operational, not esoteric intellectual crap."
00:11:36.070,00:11:41.284,"Now, I know he's got 10 PhDs and a 500 I.Q., but he's still a serial killer, right?"
00:11:41.326,00:11:43.744,And what do serial killers want?
00:11:43.786,00:11:45.746,"Control, power, respect."
00:11:45.788,00:11:48.124,Trophies.
00:11:48.166,00:11:51.378,"Serial killers collect fingers, hairs."
00:11:51.419,00:11:53.421,Serial rapists collect underwear.
00:11:53.463,00:11:55.756,"Right, so what's his trophy?"
00:11:55.798,00:11:58.385,He wants us to publish the manifesto in a newspaper.
00:11:58.426,00:12:01.638,"So we publish it, he goes, gets it, buys a copy."
00:12:01.680,00:12:05.766,"I mean, he can buy The New York Times at any newsstand in the country any time he wants."
00:12:05.808,00:12:07.768,It's not actionable.
00:12:07.810,00:12:10.522,The Post.
00:12:10.564,00:12:12.065,-What about it?
00:12:10.564,00:12:14.192,"-Every time I finish the Times crossword, I go get The Post."
00:12:14.234,00:12:18.488,It's a pain in the ass because you can only buy it at one newsstand in the city.
00:12:23.117,00:12:25.912,So if we publish in The Post...
00:12:25.953,00:12:27.746,Then we know he's in the Bay Area.
00:12:27.788,00:12:30.958,Stan: He'll want to see it.
00:12:31.000,00:12:35.088,"He'll want to see people buying it, he'll want to see people reading it."
00:12:35.129,00:12:37.798,He's going to want to see his ideas make a difference.
00:12:37.840,00:12:41.969,"Dude, that's 150 S.O.G., minimum."
00:12:42.011,00:12:44.514,"Well, it's not my problem."
00:12:44.556,00:12:47.601,Fitz has got to sell it.
00:12:49.852,00:12:51.020,-Cole.
00:12:51.062,00:12:54.274,Got Fitz and Tabby in here.
00:12:54.315,00:12:56.817,"-Go ahead, Fitz."
00:12:54.315,00:12:59.820,"-We know he's Bay Area, and we think if we publish, he would buy the paper as a trophy."
00:12:59.862,00:13:12.375,"The Washington Post is sold at only one newsstand in the Bay Area, so if we publish exclusively in The Post, he'll have to come there and buy it, so on publication day, I'm proposing we follow and identify every single person who buys a Washington Post in San Francisco."
00:13:18.923,00:13:21.175,Don: Is this a joke?
00:13:24.887,00:13:30.017,We would have to drain the entire country of surveillance teams.
00:13:30.059,00:13:31.936,"Jim: Yes, sir."
00:13:31.978,00:13:35.732,That's insane.
00:13:37.484,00:13:39.235,Janet: Hello.
00:13:39.277,00:13:41.112,"Freeh: Madam Attorney General, thank you for having us."
00:13:41.154,00:13:43.864,"Director Freeh, S.A.C. Ackerman."
00:13:43.906,00:13:45.617,Thank you both for waiting.
00:13:53.916,00:13:55.794,I guess that's a no.
00:13:55.834,00:13:57.796,That was fun.
00:13:57.836,00:13:59.880,All right.
00:13:59.922,00:14:02.175,Back to work.
00:14:03.551,00:14:06.053,Freeh: Thank you for seeing us on such short notice.
00:14:06.095,00:14:09.724,"Well, domestic terror has a way of clearing the decks, doesn't it?"
00:14:09.766,00:14:12.268,Especially when the media is involved.
00:14:12.310,00:14:15.188,Woman: Can I get you a coffee or some water?
00:14:15.229,00:14:17.982,Wudder.
00:14:18.024,00:14:19.900,Are you from Philly?
00:14:19.942,00:14:21.902,"Originally, yeah."
00:14:21.944,00:14:24.489,"Freeh: No, thank you."
00:14:30.911,00:14:33.665,So the Unabomber's publishing deadline is approaching.
00:14:33.707,00:14:36.250,The Times and The Post are on my call sheet.
00:14:36.292,00:14:38.503,What am I going to tell them?
00:14:38.545,00:14:41.673,Ackerman?
00:14:43.257,00:14:45.593,The FBI recommendation...
00:14:48.137,00:14:50.181,Freeh: Don?
00:14:52.016,00:14:58.231,"The FBI recommendation is that we publish the manifesto, in full."
00:15:00.316,00:15:05.112,We publish exclusively in The Washington Post as part of a two-pronged approach.
00:15:05.154,00:15:09.158,First prong -- forensic linguistics.
00:15:09.200,00:15:23.256,"If we make the manifesto widely accessible, I believe that there is an excellent chance that a friend or a colleague of the Unabomber will recognize his unique language and ideology and will turn him in."
00:15:23.297,00:15:29.429,"Second, there's a high likelihood that the Unabomber lives in the Bay Area."
00:15:29.470,00:15:35.976,"Now, The Washington Post is sold at only one location in San Francisco."
00:15:36.018,00:15:48.281,"This unique advantage will allow us to stage a large surveillance operation to follow, to question, to identify every individual who buys a copy of The Post on the day of publication."
00:15:48.322,00:15:50.408,While this operation...
00:15:53.661,00:15:58.207,While the size and scale of this operation is unprecedented...
00:15:59.834,00:16:04.004,...we believe it to be a singular opportunity to lure the Unabomber into the light.
00:16:04.046,00:16:06.800,That's an unusual strategy.
00:16:06.841,00:16:09.761,You're betting big that he's in the Bay Area.
00:16:11.512,00:16:20.020,"Well, we've traced every Unabom letter, package, and bomb to the exact mailbox he dropped it in."
00:16:20.062,00:16:23.858,Every single one of them is within an eight-mile radius of San Francisco.
00:16:23.900,00:16:30.615,"If he's coming to town to mail his bombs, he'll come to town to buy his manifesto."
00:16:30.657,00:16:32.158,And what's the precedent here?
00:16:32.199,00:16:34.535,Where do we stand once all this is done?
00:16:49.258,00:16:51.093,If you catch him.
00:16:51.135,00:16:53.680,"Don: Yes, ma'am."
00:16:53.721,00:16:55.181,Big if.
00:16:55.222,00:16:58.768,"Director Freeh, is FBI HQ on board with this?"
00:17:00.645,00:17:10.655,Don has taken it upon himself to propose implementing one of the largest surveillance operations in FBI history.
00:17:10.697,00:17:16.160,We're happy to let Don take the lead and be the face of this operation.
00:17:16.202,00:17:18.538,"Don, you're nearing retirement, aren't you?"
00:17:18.579,00:17:23.083,You're aware of the implications of this coming undone.
00:17:23.125,00:17:26.880,You still want to do it?
00:17:26.921,00:17:36.096,"What I don't want to do is see any more pictures of ripped-up bodies, and I don't want to pawn this case off on the next guy coming after me."
00:17:36.138,00:17:38.182,This is our best move.
00:17:38.224,00:17:40.100,It's risky.
00:17:40.142,00:17:42.729,We've got others.
00:17:42.770,00:17:45.189,But this one's the best.
00:17:45.231,00:17:50.028,"Well, I just want to make certain you're aware of the consequences here."
00:17:50.069,00:18:03.123,"What happened at Waco, my decisions there will haunt me for the rest of my natural life, and I can say from experience that everything is different when the camera is pointed at you."
00:18:03.165,00:18:06.044,Yeah.
00:18:06.085,00:18:12.592,But I'd rather respect the man I see in the mirror than the man I see on TV.
00:18:12.633,00:18:15.762,Okay.
00:18:15.803,00:18:18.180,You have the full support of the D.O.J.
00:18:22.184,00:18:24.186,Freeh: Madam Attorney General.
00:18:24.228,00:18:26.397,-Director.
00:18:26.439,00:18:31.485,"Don, I admire your moral courage in this."
00:18:31.527,00:18:37.366,"It isn't always rewarded, and in your case, I certainly hope it is."
00:18:37.408,00:18:40.661,"Thank you, Madam Attorney General."
00:18:45.541,00:18:47.001,Man: I'm following you.
00:18:47.043,00:18:48.962,-Mrs. Fitzgerald?
00:18:49.003,00:18:51.881,-I'm Tabby Miller.
00:18:51.923,00:18:54.759,Welcome to the biggest shit show on Earth.
00:19:00.848,00:19:03.643,Jim: They're asking for...
00:19:03.684,00:19:05.185,"Publication, stuff that we're..."
00:19:08.982,00:19:11.943,-I needed to see this.
00:19:11.985,00:19:13.527,-Hey. You made it.
00:19:13.569,00:19:16.196,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:19:17.239,00:19:18.783,-Hi.
00:19:18.825,00:19:20.409,-So nice to meet you.
00:19:20.451,00:19:21.869,Natalie: I work with your husband.
00:19:21.911,00:19:24.204,I've been hearing so much about you.
00:19:24.246,00:19:26.833,Have you?
00:19:35.716,00:19:39.137,"Man: Gentlemen, good where you are."
00:19:39.178,00:19:41.014,S.A.C. Ackerman?
00:19:57.279,00:19:59.824,Don: Good afternoon.
00:19:59.866,00:20:09.000,"My name is Don Ackerman, the special agent in charge, FBI, San Francisco, and one of the leaders of the Unabom task force."
00:20:09.042,00:20:18.258,"The Attorney General, Janet Reno, and FBI Director Louis J. Freeh today announced that they recommend the publication of the Unabomber's manifesto."
00:20:18.300,00:20:22.680,Concern for public safety ultimately led to this decision.
00:20:22.722,00:20:28.978,The Unabom task force continues to encourage the cooperation of the American public by calling our hotline.
00:20:29.020,00:20:46.746,"The FBI can now be found at our brand-new home page on the world wide web at www.fbi.gov, and in the coming days, we will upload the manifesto for anyone to access."
00:20:46.787,00:20:59.092,We ask that the public pay particular attention to the philosophies in the manifesto and to try to recall if they know any individuals who have had similar philosophies or who have written in similar linguistic styles...
00:20:59.133,00:21:02.845,Philosophies.
00:21:02.887,00:21:09.769,"Don: We believe that with the help of the American public, the Unabomber will have no place to hide."
00:21:09.810,00:21:12.312,And now I will take your questions.
00:21:12.354,00:21:14.440,So good.
00:21:16.734,00:21:18.485,Whoo!
00:21:20.029,00:21:21.572,"Ellie: Hey, I forgot to tell you."
00:21:21.614,00:21:28.579,"I got a call this morning from school, and they've got head lice going around like crazy."
00:21:28.621,00:21:31.791,They were asking if I could come in.
00:21:31.832,00:21:34.334,"Begging, actually."
00:21:34.376,00:21:39.757,"I told them no because I kind of feel like you need me here, right?"
00:21:39.799,00:21:43.343,It's fine if you need to go.
00:21:43.385,00:21:44.720,"If you want to go back, it's okay."
00:21:44.762,00:21:47.347,"Okay, but I don't want to go."
00:21:47.389,00:21:49.558,"Okay, then stay, have some fun, but I'm not going to be around."
00:21:49.600,00:21:52.145,I'm going to stay.
00:21:54.230,00:21:59.110,What -- what's the matter?
00:22:03.405,00:22:04.991,It's fine.
00:22:05.032,00:22:07.160,"Go. Go, go."
00:22:14.625,00:22:17.336,Koppel: Let us describe what has happened plainly.
00:22:17.377,00:22:19.546,"It is blackmail, pure and simple."
00:22:19.588,00:22:22.967,Since when do we trust a serial killer?
00:22:23.009,00:22:27.513,Reporter: The bomber calls his manifesto Industrial Society and its Future.
00:22:27.554,00:22:43.279,"Reporter #2: Eight solid-gray pages, perhaps as likely to be discarded as trudged through to reach the Unabomber's central thesis that technology has gotten the human race into a fix from which there is not likely to be any easy escape."
00:22:43.321,00:22:52.038,"Reporter #3: Now that his so-called manifesto has been published in The Washington Post, say investigators, they're hoping for more than just a cease-fire in the bombings and threats."
00:22:52.079,00:23:00.046,"Maybe somewhere in this densely-worded text, there will be some concrete clues to his identity, which may finally net investigators an arrest."
00:23:27.031,00:23:28.824,"PO1: Be advised, this is PO1."
00:23:28.866,00:23:32.661,"Unsub is a black male, black shirt, jeans, going into the park."
00:23:34.496,00:23:36.414,I have the eye.
00:23:36.456,00:23:37.791,"SF1: SF2, this is SF1."
00:23:37.833,00:23:42.420,"Unsub is white male, 60s, gray shirt, moving inside the park."
00:23:42.462,00:23:43.589,SF1: This is SF1.
00:23:43.630,00:23:46.466,I have eyes on unsub 4.
00:23:46.508,00:23:48.135,"SF1: SF3, this is SF1."
00:23:48.177,00:23:49.887,"Unsub is a white female, gray suit."
00:23:49.929,00:23:52.598,She's exiting onto Stockton Street.
00:23:52.639,00:23:54.141,"SF3: SF1, this is SF3."
00:23:54.183,00:23:55.433,I have the eye.
00:23:57.353,00:23:58.771,"PO1: PO4, this is PO1."
00:23:58.812,00:24:01.607,"Unsub is a white male, 40s, short hair, red shirt."
00:24:01.648,00:24:03.276,Man: I've got the eye.
00:24:03.317,00:24:05.278,White male in his 40s.
00:24:10.074,00:24:15.121,"Man #2: Listen, once you clear your unsubs, please will you circle back around, ASAP."
00:24:25.881,00:24:27.425,Copy.
00:24:37.017,00:24:41.397,Don: Half of San Francisco's shown up just to buy the manifesto.
00:24:41.439,00:24:43.357,"What a world, huh?"
00:24:43.399,00:24:44.775,"LA1: LA12, this is LA1."
00:24:44.817,00:24:46.860,"Unsub is a white male, blue shirt, khakis..."
00:24:46.902,00:24:49.863,This is LA1.
00:24:49.905,00:24:51.198,"Yeah, copy that."
00:24:51.240,00:24:53.326,"SA1: SF4, this is SA1."
00:24:53.367,00:24:57.371,"Subject is a black male, brown leather jacket, 30s, uh, just stopped at the newsstand."
00:24:57.704,00:25:00.333,"Excuse me, sir."
00:25:06.297,00:25:07.840,"Burkhardt, what's your status?"
00:25:07.881,00:25:09.549,Burkhardt: Subject cooperative.
00:25:09.591,00:25:12.386,He's a regular customer of Harold's.
00:25:12.428,00:25:20.769,"Man: ... A Brown Saturn, license plate number 2, Yankee, bravo, November, 6, 1, 7."
00:25:20.811,00:25:22.562,"No, sorry."
00:25:22.604,00:25:27.067,"Unsub is a white male, 20s, black leather jacket, moving South on the plaza."
00:25:27.776,00:25:30.570,"Man: Sacramento 3, requesting data on unsub 5."
00:25:30.612,00:25:36.452,"Jim: Sacramento 3, the unsub five is Rafael Fetters, Pacific Heights, should be all clear."
00:25:36.494,00:25:39.413,"Follow him to his destination, proceed with the interview."
00:25:40.622,00:25:43.959,Anything particular that you bought The Post for?
00:25:51.800,00:25:53.593,"PO1: PO3, this is PO1."
00:25:53.635,00:25:56.430,"Unsub is white male, 50s, brown leather jacket."
00:25:56.472,00:25:57.973,Yeah!
00:25:58.015,00:26:01.018,"CA9, his name is Willie Wright."
00:26:01.060,00:26:03.145,"Man: No hits, subject clear."
00:26:08.817,00:26:11.195,We're good to clear.
00:26:11.237,00:26:14.073,Copy that.
00:26:14.114,00:26:15.908,Running out of time.
00:26:15.949,00:26:19.161,Newsstand's closing soon.
00:26:19.203,00:26:20.996,"Woman: No hits, subject cleared."
00:26:21.038,00:26:22.498,-Cleared.
00:26:22.540,00:26:24.624,-No history hits.
00:26:26.668,00:26:31.924,"Woman: Unsub 109, white male, 50s, green hooded jacket, sunglasses."
00:26:31.965,00:26:33.633,This is the last guy.
00:26:33.675,00:26:36.136,We've cleared everyone else.
00:26:36.178,00:26:37.679,That's the profile.
00:26:49.649,00:26:51.860,He's got it.
00:27:04.706,00:27:08.794,"SF67, I want you on unsub 109."
00:27:08.835,00:27:11.422,"Eyes on unsub 109, copy that."
00:27:14.632,00:27:17.094,Later.
00:27:22.640,00:27:25.144,Gonna lose him.
00:27:33.068,00:27:37.030,Going into BART.
00:27:37.072,00:27:38.656,Copy that.
00:28:15.735,00:28:17.530,"Conductor: Now arriving, Powell Street."
00:28:17.571,00:28:20.533,Stand clear.
00:28:57.236,00:28:59.071,Female voice: The doors are closing.
00:28:59.112,00:29:01.240,Please stand clear of the doors.
00:29:17.381,00:29:20.217,"Conductor: Now arriving, Rockridge Station."
00:29:33.439,00:29:35.315,Female voice: The doors are closing.
00:29:35.357,00:29:37.817,Please stand clear of the doors.
00:29:56.962,00:29:59.673,Jim: She's been out of touch too long.
00:30:06.972,00:30:10.976,Conductor: Montgomery Station.
00:30:11.017,00:30:12.894,Female voice: The doors are closing.
00:30:12.936,00:30:14.854,Please stand clear of the doors.
00:30:16.940,00:30:19.318,FBI! Stop!
00:30:26.659,00:30:28.868,FBI! Stop! Get down!
00:30:46.512,00:30:48.639,FBI.
00:31:23.965,00:31:25.718,FBI! Freeze!
00:31:35.686,00:31:37.771,FBI! Freeze!
00:31:42.984,00:31:43.943,Get on the ground!
00:31:43.985,00:31:47.865,Get on the ground now!
00:31:50.992,00:31:53.245,"Come in, SF67."
00:31:58.542,00:31:59.752,"Tabby, you there?"
00:32:04.005,00:32:05.424,-You bitch.
00:32:05.465,00:32:08.343,Are you him?
00:32:08.385,00:32:10.846,Man: Go to hell.
00:32:10.888,00:32:12.514,-Is there a bomb in that bag?
00:32:12.556,00:32:15.768,What the hell are you talking about?
00:32:17.728,00:32:19.479,"Tabby: Oh, shit."
00:32:29.907,00:32:31.909,Yeah.
00:32:31.950,00:32:33.285,He's just some damn druggie.
00:32:33.326,00:32:34.787,He's got a bunch of open warrants.
00:32:34.828,00:32:36.162,That's why he was acting weird.
00:32:40.375,00:32:42.335,Except Unabom.
00:32:42.377,00:32:44.463,Right.
00:33:15.034,00:33:18.037,"So a total failure, then."
00:33:18.079,00:33:21.458,"Oh, it was a brave call."
00:33:21.500,00:33:23.836,That's too bad.
00:33:23.877,00:33:25.044,Thank you.
00:34:14.511,00:34:22.101,"...In fact, our government is negotiating with terrorists out of one corner of its mouth while, out of the other side of its mouth, it tells the American public, No, we don't deal with terrorism."
00:34:22.143,00:34:23.896,We couldn't possibly deal with terrorists.
00:34:23.937,00:34:27.148,"Where that's exactly what they do, so it's nothing new."
00:34:27.190,00:34:32.738,"It's just that we're seeing publicly for the first time what hypocrites the FBI truly are, and, frankly..."
00:34:32.779,00:34:34.072,-Fitz.
00:34:32.779,00:34:35.532,-...they look like fools in front of the entire nation.
00:34:35.574,00:34:39.411,"The Unabomber had called them fools, and we can all see that he was correct."
00:34:39.452,00:34:43.456,"If I were an FBI agent right now, I would be ashamed."
00:34:43.498,00:34:47.044,"Ashamed to show my face, ashamed of my institution."
00:34:47.085,00:34:48.587,Interviewer: Excuse me.
00:34:48.628,00:34:51.130,You're a pornographer saying the FBI should be ashamed?
00:34:51.172,00:34:53.008,Guccione: That's right.
00:34:51.172,00:34:54.509,"At Penthouse magazine, we don't say one thing and do another."
00:34:54.551,00:34:56.845,"We don't say, Oh, we're so high and mighty and pure."
00:34:56.887,00:35:07.522,"We never stoop to bargaining with a terrorist, then basically bend over, spread our cheeks for him in front of the whole world, which is what the FBI just did, and I think the country has to think long and hard about that."
00:35:07.564,00:35:09.649,Who can we really trust?
00:35:22.495,00:35:24.081,I know you think this is a setback.
00:35:24.122,00:35:26.708,It's really a huge win.
00:35:26.750,00:35:28.251,The manifesto is out there.
00:35:28.293,00:35:34.173,"People will read it to someone who'll recognize his idiolect -- Stan: Yeah, everyone's recognizing the idiolect."
00:35:34.215,00:35:37.552,You've taken the investigation backwards.
00:35:37.594,00:35:45.602,"We now have a tip line that's being pounded by every ex-wife, every pissed-off sister-in-law, every brother with a grudge in the country."
00:35:45.644,00:35:47.353,It's all garbage.
00:35:47.395,00:35:50.440,"Some birthday cards, a grocery list."
00:35:50.482,00:35:53.192,Got a book report from My Side of the Mountain.
00:35:53.234,00:35:56.195,Here's a good one. You recognize the spelling on that?
00:35:56.237,00:36:01.618,"The fax machine is spitting this stuff out faster than we can reload the paper, let alone the mail."
00:36:01.660,00:36:06.414,"The country's trash can's being dumped in our lap here, and it's worthless."
00:36:08.249,00:36:15.757,"Don: Your TDY with the Unabom task force is terminated, and if we need your expertise again, we'll make sure to contact you."
00:36:19.344,00:36:22.514,There's still a lot of work I could do with document analysis.
00:36:26.685,00:36:29.228,"You want to know the truth, Fitz?"
00:36:29.270,00:36:32.649,"I feel I can tell you this, frankly."
00:36:32.691,00:36:39.489,"You're going to have a long career with the FBI, but it's not because you're talented or special."
00:36:39.531,00:36:48.957,"See, you've been telling yourself your whole life that all of your problems are because you're an artist, because you're a special snowflake."
00:36:48.999,00:36:50.416,But you're not.
00:36:50.458,00:36:59.134,"You're just another asshole, and you're going home now so we can bring in some other asshole to replace you."
00:36:59.176,00:37:00.343,And guess what?
00:37:00.385,00:37:04.931,No one's going to even know the difference.
00:37:04.973,00:37:07.433,"Okay, that's it."
00:37:41.342,00:37:43.344,"Sean: Dan, we're going to move this down here."
00:37:43.386,00:37:44.971,Dan: Okay.
00:37:45.013,00:37:47.306,Sean: Clear everything off.
00:37:47.348,00:37:50.476,"Everything, please."
00:37:50.518,00:37:51.770,"Watch out, Dad."
00:37:51.811,00:37:54.313,Can't mess it up.
00:37:54.355,00:37:57.234,"If one piece falls, it's going to screw up the entire game."
00:37:57.275,00:37:59.236,Don't screw up the entire game.
00:38:01.821,00:38:05.575,Ellie: You need to ask Mrs. DeFrancis for a ride to practice Thursday.
00:38:05.617,00:38:09.162,"Not home from, to."
00:38:09.204,00:38:10.872,"Sean: I know, I heard you."
00:38:10.914,00:38:13.332,"Ellie: Dad's going to pick you up, though, all right?"
00:38:13.374,00:38:15.334,-Okay.
00:38:15.376,00:38:18.004,Right.
00:39:30.702,00:39:33.330,-Mademoiselle.
00:39:48.094,00:40:54.493,-Could I -- - Hello?
00:40:54.535,00:40:56.829,"David: Hey, sweetheart."
00:40:56.871,00:41:01.042,"Good, good, um..."
00:41:01.084,00:41:02.752,Everything okay?
00:41:02.794,00:41:06.881,"Um, I -- I don't want to, uh, upset you."
00:41:06.923,00:41:09.675,"I just, um..."
00:41:09.717,00:41:13.346,Have you read the Unabomber manifesto yet?
00:41:13.388,00:41:15.514,No.
00:41:15.556,00:41:17.516,Linda: I think you should.
00:41:17.558,00:41:24.274,"I think you should, um, go get The Washington Post and read it."
00:00:26.067,00:00:27.569,"gonna do, David?"
00:00:27.611,00:00:29.363,"Uh, are you already assuming he's guilty?"
00:00:29.404,00:00:32.992,"'Cause, I mean, really, when you look at the evidence here-- Uh, no."
00:00:33.033,00:00:34.075,-I feel like you-- -I'm not.
00:00:34.117,00:00:35.661,I'm not assuming he's guilty.
00:00:35.703,00:00:42.793,All I'm saying is that I see a connection between that letter of Ted's and the Unabomber manifesto.
00:00:42.835,00:00:44.503,"Well, when I look at it, I don't see the connection."
00:00:44.545,00:00:48.089,I don't see this.
00:00:44.545,00:00:54.555,I-- Maybe you're-- Have you considered your own personal feelings for Ted might be getting in the way of making an objective determination here?
00:00:54.596,00:00:56.974,-You're asking me that?
00:00:57.016,00:01:00.101,"I mean, you've never met him."
00:01:00.143,00:01:02.897,"Yes, he sent you a nasty letter."
00:01:02.938,00:01:06.400,But every family has its oddball.
00:01:06.441,00:01:08.109,I know Ted.
00:01:08.151,00:01:11.112,H-He was always good.
00:01:11.154,00:01:12.614,He was my hero.
00:01:16.159,00:01:17.953,he's got nothing to worry about.
00:01:17.995,00:01:19.454,The...
00:01:19.496,00:01:22.082,Ted lives a very unconventional lifestyle.
00:01:22.123,00:01:25.044,He is paranoid.
00:01:25.084,00:01:28.964,"I mean, those people on Ruby Ridge, they were innocent, too."
00:01:29.006,00:01:31.383,And an FBI sniper shot them in the back.
00:01:31.425,00:01:35.429,If we accuse him and we are wrong...
00:01:39.391,00:01:42.101,...it'd be like...
00:01:42.143,00:01:46.481,"taking my own brother's life, and I-I c-- I can't."
00:01:48.191,00:01:51.070,"But, David..."
00:01:51.111,00:01:53.321,what if we're right?
00:02:45.415,00:02:49.210,Y-You came to me why exactly?
00:02:49.252,00:02:51.338,"I mean, you could just mail it in."
00:02:51.379,00:02:52.923,I'll give you the address for the Task Force.
00:02:52.965,00:02:54.967,-W-Well...
00:03:02.265,00:03:07.270,"As soon as you get on the criminal justice system's radar, you become a target, especially if you live an unconventional life."
00:03:07.312,00:03:11.232,All right.
00:03:11.274,00:03:14.069,I will channel this directly to the Unabom Task Force.
00:03:14.111,00:03:17.990,"It'll come from my office, but you and your brother will remain completely anonymous."
00:03:18.032,00:03:22.285,"I'll make it clear that this is not for distribution, even internally within the UTF."
00:03:22.327,00:03:25.330,Tight chain of custody.
00:03:25.372,00:03:30.127,"Now, they'll do a complete analysis and get us an opinion."
00:03:30.169,00:03:33.881,"And if it's not a match, we can all sleep easy."
00:03:36.925,00:03:39.011,I think-- yeah.
00:03:39.053,00:03:42.263,"All right. I-- To be clear, our priority is..."
00:03:42.305,00:03:45.350,is... Ted's safety.
00:03:45.392,00:03:51.231,"I mean, he-- Even if he is the Unabomber, he's a human being."
00:03:51.272,00:03:52.524,He has a soul.
00:03:52.566,00:03:54.776,And-- and we need to...
00:03:54.818,00:03:57.112,We need to protect him.
00:03:59.322,00:04:04.536,I've really respected in you has been your life in the desert.
00:04:04.578,00:04:12.002,And now you're going to leave all that just because this female has decided to permit you to become her personal property.
00:04:12.044,00:04:17.340,"I presume you will now be adopting a conventional middle-class lifestyle, become an accountant maybe."
00:04:17.382,00:04:21.678,Or why not sell out all the way and become a lawyer?
00:04:21.720,00:04:25.515,"The reason you get me so upset is that I do care about you, David."
00:04:25.557,00:04:29.310,You're still my little brother and you still have my loyalty.
00:04:37.360,00:04:39.738,-Hello?
00:04:39.780,00:04:42.323,I just got word from my guy in the UTF.
00:04:42.365,00:04:45.744,"They analyzed the letter, and they're not moving forward with the lead."
00:04:45.786,00:04:47.287,It's the wrong typewriter.
00:04:47.328,00:04:48.830,So it's not him?
00:04:48.872,00:04:50.749,Your brother's been cleared.
00:04:50.791,00:04:51.583,Thank you.
00:04:51.625,00:04:53.919,It's not him! It's not Ted!
00:04:53.961,00:04:56.588,Ted Kaczynski is not the Unabomber!
00:04:56.630,00:04:59.883,"Oh, God. Oh."
00:05:24.241,00:05:26.701,Three months you've been back here.
00:05:30.413,00:05:31.873,Three months...
00:05:31.915,00:05:33.583,of sleepwalking.
00:05:33.625,00:05:37.212,"Half an eye on that manifesto there, the other half on the fax machine."
00:05:37.254,00:05:41.216,You're like a teenage girl waiting for her ex to call.
00:05:41.258,00:05:42.884,He dumped you.
00:05:42.926,00:05:44.094,Move on.
00:05:48.431,00:05:50.725,Fitz...
00:05:50.767,00:05:55.438,"you are capable of great things here, but not until you let Unabom go."
00:05:55.480,00:05:57.983,I've been where you are right now.
00:05:58.025,00:05:59.442,I know.
00:05:59.484,00:06:02.403,I know that it seems like more than a case right now.
00:06:02.445,00:06:04.447,But it's just a case.
00:06:04.489,00:06:09.911,"And I say, from experience, let it go."
00:06:09.953,00:06:12.164,Yeah.
00:06:16.626,00:06:18.545,There's nothing by him.
00:06:18.586,00:06:20.297,This is all you got?
00:06:20.339,00:06:22.257,the grocery lists and stuff.
00:06:22.299,00:06:24.134,It's not here.
00:06:24.176,00:06:25.468,a million-dollar reward.
00:06:25.510,00:06:27.304,You realize how much crap we get in?
00:07:07.010,00:07:08.970,"Oh, I see. You're all gonna gang up on me."
00:07:09.012,00:07:10.680,not what this is about.
00:07:10.722,00:07:12.473,You have three parents now.
00:07:12.515,00:07:14.601,And we want to make sure we're all saying the same thing.
00:07:16.519,00:07:19.898,...to unpack.
00:07:27.155,00:07:29.408,It's still okay if you want to come live with me.
00:07:33.745,00:07:36.998,"-Hey, Negro."
00:07:37.040,00:07:39.751,"Yo, look. A long-ass letter come across your desk?"
00:07:39.793,00:07:41.502,Evidence slip says it's not a match.
00:07:41.544,00:07:44.965,I'm about to bag it up and send it back to the lawyer. Why?
00:07:49.094,00:07:52.555,It's the wrong typewriter.
00:08:15.329,00:08:16.955,Hey. Ernie?
00:08:18.581,00:08:21.709,Can you put your headphones on and look the other way for like 10 minutes?
00:08:21.751,00:08:24.212,That's do not distribute.
00:08:24.254,00:08:26.173,If the boss catches you with that or finds out I let you...
00:08:26.214,00:08:30.718,Look. It's on me.
00:08:30.760,00:08:34.348,This goes into the safe at 3:00.
00:08:34.389,00:08:35.932,Thank you.
00:08:47.610,00:08:48.778,I'll get my daughter!
00:08:48.820,00:08:50.197,Do not try any kind of rescue.
00:08:50.238,00:08:51.781,Do you understand me?
00:08:51.823,00:08:54.993,You would jeopardize the lives of the Vice President and everyone else in the arena.
00:08:55.035,00:08:56.077,Believe me. We know what the hell we're doing.
00:08:57.329,00:08:58.497,Our agents are entering the arena.
00:08:58.538,00:08:59.747,-You stay where you are.
00:08:59.789,00:09:02.542,We are gonna do this by the numbers.
00:09:07.964,00:09:08.923,Where have you been?
00:09:08.965,00:09:10.550,It's later here.
00:09:10.591,00:09:12.760,going through right now.
00:09:12.802,00:09:15.889,It's do not distribute.
00:09:15.930,00:09:17.598,"Shit, dude, if I get caught..."
00:09:17.640,00:09:20.560,All right.
00:09:23.480,00:09:25.982,Hey. Just gonna run to work.
00:09:26.024,00:09:26.983,-Okay.
00:09:27.025,00:09:28.943,-You guys okay?
00:09:28.985,00:09:31.154,Keep an eye on him.
00:09:52.675,00:09:56.596,...beginning of this already... inability of people to avoid boredom...
00:09:59.682,00:10:02.894,Let us first consider the solution...
00:10:02.936,00:10:05.564,sketched by Perry London in his book Behavior Control.
00:10:05.646,00:10:09.734,This solution makes a convenient example.
00:10:10.026,00:10:12.028,...disseminate it among the population at large.
00:10:12.070,00:10:14.655,People can then use this technology...
00:10:14.697,00:10:16.657,...disseminate it among the population at large.
00:10:16.699,00:10:19.536,People can then...
00:10:20.370,00:10:25.041,Continued scientific progress will inevitably result in the extinction of individual liberty.
00:10:25.083,00:10:28.920,"Technology, freedom, control."
00:10:28.962,00:10:30.130,It's him.
00:10:30.171,00:10:34.675,I-I wouldn't-- of the manifesto.
00:10:34.717,00:10:38.472,"It's the same ideas in the same order and the way he writes, is idiolect."
00:10:38.513,00:10:39.973,It is identical!
00:10:40.014,00:10:42.058,"S-So, what's his name?"
00:10:42.100,00:10:45.686,I don't know.
00:10:47.772,00:10:49.941,-What lawyer?
00:10:49.983,00:10:55.363,Okay? Just please let me go through the proper cha-- Just find out! I don't care how!
00:10:55.405,00:10:56.864,This is him!
00:10:56.906,00:10:59.159,"And the man that wrote this letter, he is the Unabomber!"
00:10:59.200,00:11:00.785,You hear me?
00:11:09.710,00:11:11.546,Why the hell would you abandon your children?
00:11:11.588,00:11:13.340,I was only gone one minute.
00:11:13.381,00:11:15.133,What-- How long have I been?
00:11:15.175,00:11:19.720,It's been 4 hours.
00:11:27.812,00:11:29.772,Are you coming?
00:11:49.417,00:11:57.676,You're seriously trying to argue that the famously anti-technology Unabomber has two similar but not identical typewriters?
00:11:57.716,00:12:02.347,"Look. I know what forensics said, but the language of that letter is really similar to the manifesto."
00:12:06.809,00:12:09.354,You know something concrete that I missed?
00:12:14.234,00:12:15.360,It's a steel trap.
00:12:15.402,00:12:17.778,"Well, no."
00:12:17.820,00:12:22.534,"It's just the overall-- Look, I just think that this is a strong lead that we should go down the road with!"
00:12:22.576,00:12:24.661,"Track down the writer, do some interviews."
00:12:24.703,00:12:26.663,I don't think you understand the backstory.
00:12:26.705,00:12:28.206,It's a lawsuit waiting to happen.
00:12:31.959,00:12:35.672,"It's a hornets' nest, Tabby."
00:12:42.512,00:12:43.804,"Hey, yeah."
00:12:43.846,00:12:47.141,I got an incomplete billing record here.
00:12:47.183,00:12:48.727,"Uh, one of Anthony Bisceglie's cases."
00:12:48.767,00:12:50.562,"Hey, are you coming with us tonight?"
00:12:50.604,00:12:53.231,While You Were Sleeping.
00:12:56.859,00:13:00.280,"I mean, Peter Gallagher, right?"
00:13:05.326,00:13:07.786,"Thanks, hon! See ya later."
00:13:10.206,00:13:14.835,"Bad move, Tabby."

00:13:21.800,00:13:23.762,"certain, Tabby."
00:13:23.802,00:13:27.140,Anything and everything you get out of this has to go through me.
00:13:27.181,00:13:30.644,You do not talk to anyone at the UTF without coming to me first and making a plan.
00:13:30.685,00:13:33.563,I swear I will not even breathe without going through you.
00:13:33.605,00:13:35.398,All right?
00:13:36.899,00:13:39.902,Okay. Got a pen?

00:14:10.433,00:14:11.768,You didn't have to.
00:14:11.810,00:14:13.978,I don't really want you...

00:14:29.494,00:14:33.289,"...we should put it all back together, just start over."
00:14:36.459,00:14:39.504,"You don't even realize you were wrong, do you?"
00:14:48.471,00:14:50.139,"You know what, Jim?"
00:14:50.181,00:14:51.850,Boys and I-- we're gonna be okay.
00:14:51.891,00:14:52.933,We're gonna be fine.
00:14:52.975,00:14:56.354,Everything's gonna work out for us.
00:14:56.396,00:15:03.403,"But unless you stop now, I don't-- I don't know how all this ends for you."
00:15:05.530,00:15:07.323,I really don't.

00:16:16.100,00:16:17.852,It's about the letter.
00:16:17.894,00:16:21.230,"I'm sorry. I don't know how you got my name or my address, but I'd appreciate it if you get off my property right now."
00:16:21.272,00:16:27.779,"to tell you this, but I read the letter you submitted, and the man who wrote that letter is the Unabomber."

00:17:29.382,00:17:31.634,or I'll call the police!
00:17:37.598,00:17:39.517,One door-- your door!
00:17:52.112,00:17:58.118,"If you're an FBI profiler, you know they're looking for an airline mechanic who is around 45 years old and he is uneducated."
00:17:58.160,00:17:59.871,He does not fit that profile at all.
00:17:59.913,00:18:01.372,That's not the profile.
00:18:01.414,00:18:04.959,"your bosses on Charlie Rose -saying, This is the profile?"
00:18:05.001,00:18:07.503,"It's-- oh, oh, the FBI profile's wrong and they stand behind it?"
00:18:07.545,00:18:11.131,"And-- and your boss, he-- He rules out my brother's letter, but he's wrong, too."
00:18:11.173,00:18:13.634,"Everybody's wrong, except for you."
00:18:13.676,00:18:15.135,Yeah.
00:18:15.177,00:18:18.097,"You know, I-- I counsel at-risk kids, okay?"
00:18:18.138,00:18:24.020,"And the first thing I tell them-- If everybody in the world seems crazy except for you and you're the only sane one, right?"
00:18:24.062,00:18:26.647,It's time to take a hard look in the mirror.
00:18:26.689,00:18:29.901,You knocked on the wrong door.
00:18:29.943,00:18:32.070,"You need to leave me alone, please!"
00:18:32.111,00:18:34.363,I'm-- please!
00:18:34.405,00:18:36.156,And get out.
00:18:36.198,00:18:37.909,Why don't you listen to my profile?
00:18:37.951,00:18:39.159,"I-- come on, man!"
00:18:39.201,00:18:40.954,Why don't you listen to the real profile?
00:18:40.995,00:18:47.418,"And if it isn't a match for your brother, you can drive out of here in good conscience and you never have to see me again."
00:18:49.754,00:18:52.172,He's 50 to 55 years old.
00:18:52.214,00:18:54.174,He was raised near Chicago.
00:18:54.216,00:18:56.302,Read the Chicago Tribune as a boy.
00:18:56.343,00:18:59.722,He got his PhD between '67 and '72.
00:18:59.764,00:19:03.183,"Sometime after that, he just got cut off from the world."
00:19:03.225,00:19:07.187,"There's no TV, no pop culture, no close friends, no romantic relations."
00:19:07.229,00:19:09.189,Nothing. Just isolated.
00:19:09.231,00:19:15.071,"He's smart, patient, extremely precise."
00:19:15.113,00:19:16.489,And he's angry.
00:19:16.530,00:19:24.413,"He's just thin-skinned, takes offense easily, and he lashes out at those that he loves 'cause he's got no one else in his life."
00:19:24.455,00:19:27.333,"He feels underappreciated, victimized."
00:19:27.374,00:19:30.252,He's sidelined by his lesser-talented peers.
00:19:30.294,00:19:32.296,He's lonely. He longs for human connection.
00:19:32.338,00:19:36.509,But he can't find it.
00:19:36.550,00:19:38.136,So you talked to Linda?
00:19:38.177,00:19:40.220,She-- She-- You've been talking to her about my brother?
00:19:40.262,00:19:42.682,Is that-- She contacted you.
00:19:42.723,00:19:44.224,I don't know who she is.
00:19:44.266,00:19:45.434,I don't know your brother.
00:19:45.476,00:19:48.104,I don't know anyone in your life.
00:19:50.023,00:19:52.733,I do know the Unabomber.
00:19:55.903,00:19:58.197,I know him like I know myself.
00:20:06.914,00:20:08.708,Uh... uh...
00:20:08.749,00:20:10.292,Um...
00:20:12.628,00:20:14.213,Um...
00:20:19.301,00:20:20.803,Ted.
00:20:23.389,00:20:25.683,His name is Ted.
00:20:35.651,00:20:39.155,Okay. This is Ted.
00:20:39.197,00:20:40.573,That's the Unabomber.
00:20:40.614,00:20:43.242,I don't see any resemblance.
00:20:43.283,00:20:46.079,And I've looked at the sketch for-- for hours.
00:20:46.120,00:20:47.872,It's not the Unabomber.
00:20:47.914,00:20:49.790,What-- What do you-- it's an eyewitness sketch.
00:20:49.832,00:20:54.795,"-The woman at Rentech, she-- -Yeah, the woman at Rentech, the only person to ever have seen the Unabomber."
00:20:57.297,00:21:01.844,"See, the day after the Rentech bombing, she described the Unabomber to a local sketch artist."
00:21:01.886,00:21:07.725,The sketch was published and was so close that the Unabomber went into hiding for six years.
00:21:07.767,00:21:09.268,But that isn't the sketch.
00:21:09.309,00:21:22.406,"In 1994, 10 years after the Rentech bombing, the head of the Task Force decides he wants a new sketch, so he sends a new sketch artist to the eyewitness, and this time, what the eyewitness describes is that sketch."
00:21:22.448,00:21:23.908,And it is iconic.
00:21:23.950,00:21:26.326,It is the most famous police sketch in history.
00:21:26.368,00:21:28.079,But it's not the Unabomber.
00:21:28.121,00:21:34.877,"See, the second time around, the eyewitness was describing the original sketch artist-- this guy."
00:21:34.919,00:21:39.132,Some crazy thing in the human memory.
00:21:39.173,00:21:42.342,She was remembering remembering the Unabomber.
00:21:42.384,00:21:46.597,"And she had spent-- yeah, think about it-- three seconds looking at the Unabomber."
00:21:50.392,00:21:53.187,"And over time, the faces blend together."
00:21:53.229,00:21:56.315,What about the original sketch?
00:22:07.701,00:22:09.703,"Oh, my God."
00:22:17.920,00:22:19.922,"David, is this where he lives?"
00:22:19.964,00:22:24.802,Oh. That's the cabin we built together.
00:22:26.553,00:22:28.222,He's a mathematician.
00:22:28.264,00:22:32.476,He designed the cabin to a perfect mathematical ratio.
00:22:32.518,00:22:35.771,There's no electricity or running water.
00:22:35.813,00:22:38.607,"It's, uh-- It's perfect simplicity."
00:22:38.649,00:22:40.651,It's western Montana.
00:22:40.693,00:22:42.945,It's really beautiful.
00:22:43.988,00:22:48.034,He just lives off the land.
00:22:48.075,00:22:49.367,Has a little garden.
00:22:49.409,00:22:51.704,I think he lives off something like $400 a year.
00:22:53.206,00:23:01.421,"here and there, but he lives about as far outside the system as-- as anybody can this day and age."
00:23:01.463,00:23:10.306,"You know, a lot of people, even my wife, they-- They look at that and they think he's..."
00:23:10.348,00:23:11.765,He's crazy.
00:23:11.807,00:23:15.186,He just has the courage to live according to his ideals.
00:23:17.188,00:23:19.357,I respect that.
00:23:19.439,00:23:20.941,"Yeah, I do, too."
00:23:28.866,00:23:38.667,"He was pulled out there by his ideals, but there was a push, too, not long after this photo was taken."
00:23:38.709,00:23:41.670,So what was the push?
00:23:43.463,00:23:49.595,"of money living out there, and he came back to Chicago to get a job."
00:23:49.636,00:23:56.185,"I got him work at this phone factory that my, uh, father worked at-- I was a foreman there that summer."
00:23:56.227,00:23:58.478,"Anyhow, there was a girl there he had a crush on."
00:23:58.520,00:24:00.647,Her name was Ellen.
00:24:00.689,00:24:02.482,He asked her out.
00:24:02.524,00:24:13.493,"I think they went apple-picking, baked a pie in my mother's oven, but Ted is not great with people, so she told him she didn't want to see him again."
00:24:13.535,00:24:19.166,"Think she was cordial about it, but when I showed up to work the next day, there were, um..."
00:24:19.208,00:24:22.502,Certain young lady named Ellen whose fanny is very repellin'.
00:24:26.548,00:24:28.592,They were all about Ellen.
00:24:28.634,00:24:31.845,Must've been 150 of them.
00:24:31.887,00:24:33.931,messages is his weapon.
00:24:38.269,00:24:44.524,"I fired my brother, uh, and that's really when he made his break."
00:24:44.566,00:24:48.779,"He took his last paycheck, and he went out to the cabin for good."
00:24:48.821,00:24:49.989,-You still see your brother?
00:24:50.030,00:24:51.531,-You still contact him?
00:24:51.573,00:24:52.866,"-Call him, visit?"
00:24:52.908,00:24:55.535,We used to write until a few years ago.
00:24:55.577,00:24:57.455,"I mean, he sent me so many letters."
00:24:57.495,00:25:00.498,He would send me another one before I could even respond.
00:25:00.540,00:25:03.627,I probably have 100 of them.
00:25:06.839,00:25:09.133,I'm gonna have to see those letters.
00:25:09.175,00:25:12.845,I'm gonna have to see every letter that you have.
00:25:12.886,00:25:16.723,"Some are them are, uh, at my abri ... in Texas."
00:25:16.765,00:25:21.020,It's a small cabin I used to live in out there.
00:25:21.061,00:25:22.896,The rest are-- are at my mother's.
00:25:22.938,00:25:25.523,"She's nearby, so we could go get those."
00:25:25.565,00:25:27.860,We can go get 'em.
00:25:30.612,00:25:40.122,"...her son, uh, is-- And I'm the one that-- That I'm the one that turned him in."
00:25:40.164,00:25:46.504,"You know, you said there were other mothers and brothers who came forward, but, um..."
00:25:46.544,00:25:49.589,It's my brother.
00:25:49.631,00:25:51.925,My brother's the Unabomber.
00:25:54.761,00:25:59.016,Do you know what would happen if it was someone else?
00:25:59.058,00:26:02.602,99% of them would just let it go.
00:26:02.644,00:26:04.021,They would have lacked the courage.
00:26:04.063,00:26:05.856,They would have lacked the awareness to make that call.
00:26:05.898,00:26:10.610,They would have let fear get in the way of doing what was right.
00:26:10.652,00:26:15.782,"And we would never, ever know who he was, and we would never be able to stop him."
00:26:15.824,00:26:19.078,The world is lucky that it was you.
00:26:19.119,00:26:31.507,"And you have to take that burden of guilt and suffering so that the rest of us can sleep safely at night, and it is the most anyone can give."
00:26:45.896,00:26:48.690,What's going on?
00:26:52.945,00:26:56.823,"Yeah, so, if it's him, then he must be stopped."
00:26:56.865,00:27:00.618,"Because his victims, they all had mothers, too."
00:27:04.248,00:27:06.083,But he was such a happy boy.
00:27:06.125,00:27:09.128,"He-- He was so gentle with you, so loving."
00:27:09.169,00:27:10.837,Don't you remember?
00:27:10.879,00:27:15.426,So where did I go wrong?
00:27:18.720,00:27:20.473,Did something happen to him at Harvard?
00:27:20.514,00:27:23.225,He would never tell me.
00:27:23.267,00:27:27.020,But I always felt like something changed inside him there.
00:27:32.734,00:27:35.904,Or when?
00:27:41.410,00:27:43.661,Is there no answer?
00:28:17.196,00:28:18.656,Ted wrote all of these?
00:28:18.696,00:28:19.697,Yes.
00:28:27.581,00:28:29.625,These go back 30 years.
00:28:56.818,00:28:58.320,It's him.
00:28:59.821,00:29:06.245,"It's just-- I need to present this to the U.T.F., and I need to make them see it, too."
00:29:08.581,00:29:12.292,Okay.
00:29:15.295,00:29:22.761,"We need to go through Ted's handwritten letters-- His language, his ideas-- and then find points of comparison in the Unabomber's manifesto."
00:29:22.802,00:29:23.845,"Yeah, and his life, too."
00:29:23.887,00:29:25.805,"We work out his history, who he is."
00:29:25.847,00:29:28.684,Does it match the timeline?
00:30:15.105,00:30:17.149,It's him.
00:30:17.190,00:30:18.400,Do we have it?
00:30:18.442,00:30:20.778,We have him.
00:30:20.819,00:30:22.862,We have him.
00:30:32.872,00:30:33.832,-Wait.
00:30:36.835,00:30:37.836,What are you doing?
00:30:37.877,00:30:39.463,"Well, y-you said you left your wife."
00:30:39.505,00:30:41.548,"-I just thought that-- -Yeah, I did."
00:30:41.590,00:30:43.467,But...
00:30:43.509,00:30:45.051,Wow.
00:30:50.599,00:30:51.767,Sorry.
00:30:56.021,00:30:57.939,Thank you.
00:31:00.150,00:31:01.985,Thank you?
00:31:04.404,00:31:06.906,You show up here why?
00:31:06.948,00:31:11.911,"You leave your wife, you come all the way across the country to me."
00:31:11.953,00:31:13.831,What are you even doing here?
00:31:13.872,00:31:15.874,You here for me or are you here for him?
00:31:21.254,00:31:23.716,Is that what I am to you?
00:31:36.395,00:31:40.691,I'm gonna go walk the dogs.
00:32:03.004,00:32:05.090,Holy crap.
00:32:05.131,00:32:07.676,-Hey. Where's Tabby?
00:32:07.718,00:32:10.929,Where's Tabby?
00:32:20.021,00:32:24.359,"-Double-- hey, hey, hey!"
00:32:29.030,00:32:31.991,Told you to put a name on the board three months ago!
00:32:33.744,00:32:36.996,This is the Unabomber-- Theodore Kaczynski.
00:32:37.038,00:32:38.957,"Hold on, Stan."
00:32:40.959,00:32:43.295,You got five minutes. Go.
00:32:47.299,00:32:48.842,Meet Ted Kaczynski.
00:32:48.884,00:32:52.011,"He's born in 1942 outside Chicago, makes him 53."
00:32:52.053,00:32:55.014,He's got an IQ of 167.
00:32:55.056,00:32:57.267,He attended Harvard on a full scholarship at age 16.
00:32:57.309,00:33:04.065,"Got a PhD in mathematics at the University of Michigan in '68, which correlates with the formatting of the manifesto."
00:33:04.107,00:33:06.693,His dissertation was brilliant.
00:33:06.735,00:33:08.278,"It won prizes, got published."
00:33:09.070,00:33:12.031,"Just it was so advanced, only four or five mathematicians in the world could understand it."
00:33:12.073,00:33:21.291,But this plays into his need to be listened to and acknowledged as a profound genius thinker.
00:33:21.333,00:33:27.673,"Now, he taught at Berkeley for two years before he withdrew into the woods in Lincoln, Montana."
00:33:27.714,00:33:30.884,Built that cabin with his brother.
00:33:30.926,00:33:35.138,"Ted went back and forth from Chicago, but he moved there permanently in 1980."
00:33:35.180,00:33:41.645,"He's living the life that he describes in the manifesto-- Free from technology, completely alone."
00:33:41.687,00:33:46.483,"Yeah, but a lot of people live like that, and a lot of people have big degrees and grew up in Chicago."
00:33:46.525,00:33:48.527,So he fits your profile.
00:33:48.568,00:33:50.779,That does not make him the Unabomber.
00:33:50.821,00:33:52.113,You're right.
00:33:50.821,00:33:56.493,"Except in 1971, he wrote a document that could only be described as a trial run at the manifesto."
00:33:56.535,00:33:59.078,It mirrors the manifesto point by point.
00:33:59.120,00:34:02.123,It's the same order of ideas.
00:34:02.165,00:34:04.083,It's the same linguistic idiosyncrasies.
00:34:08.171,00:34:14.845,"His brother read the manifesto when we published it, and he recognized the ideas, which is why we had it published in the first place, right?"
00:34:16.680,00:34:19.933,"Plus, look."
00:34:19.975,00:34:21.977,He gave me hundreds of letters to analyze.
00:34:22.019,00:34:26.857,There's more coming from his place in Texas in the next couple of days.
00:34:30.027,00:34:34.656,"I compared his writings to the manifesto, and I found dozens of similarities."
00:34:34.698,00:34:41.162,"I also used Kaczynski's letters to map his movements for the past 20 years, and they track closely with the Unabom events."
00:34:45.834,00:34:52.841,"He's familiar with Salt Lake City, Chicago, and the Bay area-- the Unabom nexus."
00:34:52.883,00:34:57.095,"And he feels safe at universities, which is why he can plant the bombs there personally."
00:35:00.724,00:35:02.392,He fits the profile.
00:35:02.434,00:35:04.269,He fits the timeline.
00:35:04.310,00:35:07.898,The language is a match.
00:35:07.940,00:35:09.190,I got him.
00:35:10.400,00:35:12.652,Ted Kaczynski's the Unabomber.
00:35:22.203,00:35:24.205,Kaczynski's not tier one.
00:35:24.247,00:35:29.920,He's not even in our initial pool of 15 million.
00:35:29.962,00:35:32.464,"Computationally, he's not a suspect."
00:35:34.215,00:35:39.178,"Every single Unabom letter, every single Unabom package came from the Bay area, right?"
00:35:39.220,00:35:42.682,So you're telling me he drove three days every time he wanted to mail something?
00:35:42.724,00:35:45.226,He doesn't have a car.
00:35:46.603,00:35:47.771,Took a bus.
00:35:49.147,00:35:50.189,Took a bus?
00:35:51.566,00:35:54.444,It could explain why all his letters came in batches.
00:35:54.486,00:35:57.196,That's always confused me.
00:35:57.238,00:36:05.831,"He'd send a bunch of letters and two mail bombs all together at the same time, and then he'd disappear for months until the next burst."
00:36:09.668,00:36:15.465,"We have to be very, very careful about this."
00:36:15.507,00:36:20.219,"Unabomber or not, this guy's got guns, knows how to live off the land."
00:36:20.261,00:36:23.015,"So best case, he's a flight risk."
00:36:23.056,00:36:27.686,"Worst case, we're talking Ruby Ridge Montana edition."
00:36:27.727,00:36:31.940,"Stan, set up a stakeout in Lincoln, Montana, and get eyes on the cabin."
00:36:31.982,00:36:35.944,"Let's see if we can find his bank records, set up a mail cover."
00:36:35.986,00:36:38.237,"If he is taking a bus, there's got to be a record of it."
00:36:38.279,00:36:39.238,"Yeah, I'm on it."
00:36:39.280,00:36:41.867,"Fitz, what are your next moves?"
00:36:41.908,00:36:47.580,"Oh, I would love to mine these letters for linguistic evidence to prove that Ted wrote the manifesto."
00:36:47.622,00:36:52.251,"Good. Andy, I want you to sit down with Steve Freccero."
00:36:52.293,00:36:57.632,Start figuring out what we need to feed a federal judge to get inside of that cabin.
00:36:57.674,00:37:00.635,From now on...
00:37:00.677,00:37:04.056,Ted Kaczynski is Unabom suspect number one.
00:37:07.893,00:37:11.270,Ted Kaczynski. That's it.
00:37:34.252,00:37:36.963,Fitz.
00:37:39.007,00:37:46.890,"Now, uh, if I remember correctly, this letter came here with a do not distribute cover."
00:37:46.932,00:37:51.103,"Now, you were at the B.A.U."
00:37:51.144,00:37:53.479,Care to shed some light on that little mystery?
00:38:20.506,00:38:22.968,Did you just screw me?
00:38:24.010,00:38:28.306,All right. Got some work to do.
00:38:32.310,00:38:36.022,I told you you had to run-- -I tried to find you.
00:38:36.064,00:38:39.317,"Look, I can fix this."
00:38:40.193,00:38:43.905,I looked up to you.
00:38:46.407,00:38:49.744,"When you came, it was like someone finally saw me, you know?"
00:38:49.786,00:38:51.663,Saw my potential.
00:38:51.704,00:38:55.250,"I wasn't just Tabby the street agent, -who stumbled behind a desk."
00:38:55.292,00:38:58.544,"You know, I thought I could do something cool, be something more."
00:38:58.586,00:39:02.465,But you used me and you screwed me over.
00:39:04.717,00:39:08.680,"Well, you did break protocol."
00:39:08.721,00:39:11.349,"You know, when you sent the address, what'd you think was gonna happen?"
00:39:16.437,00:39:19.482,"You're leaving a trail of burnt-out corpses in your wake, man."
00:39:19.524,00:39:21.400,It's gonna catch up with you.
00:39:21.442,00:39:24.070,"You know, at the end of the road, you're gonna have nobody by your side."
00:39:24.112,00:39:25.280,Right.
00:40:10.867,00:40:12.035,Thank you.
00:40:20.085,00:40:22.962,We have to save Ted.
00:40:23.004,00:40:31.054,"Whatever it takes, no matter what we have to do or say, we have to save his life."
00:02:14.217,00:02:16.261,"-Hey, Fred."
00:02:23.060,00:02:24.103,Hey!
00:02:24.144,00:02:25.646,"Hey, Ted."
00:02:48.376,00:02:49.711,Oh.
00:02:49.753,00:02:51.212,I am so glad you're here.
00:02:51.254,00:02:53.132,"You know, would you mind helping me a tiny bit today?"
00:02:53.172,00:02:55.216,It's going to be so crazy.
00:02:55.258,00:02:56.677,"-Hey, Alan!"
00:02:58.261,00:03:01.348,Could you just pick these up?
00:03:16.947,00:03:18.949,I read the whole thing.
00:03:18.991,00:03:21.910,I read it this morning on the FBI's Internet web page.
00:03:21.952,00:03:26.456,"He's obviously very well-educated, very intelligent man."
00:03:26.498,00:03:29.126,A lot of what he says makes sense to me.
00:03:29.168,00:03:31.545,"a serial bomber, now?"
00:03:31.586,00:03:33.005,Be careful.
00:03:33.047,00:03:35.090,The FBI might come by asking questions.
00:03:36.341,00:03:37.968,We had to order a ton of extra copies.
00:03:38.010,00:03:41.180,There's actually a wait list for it.
00:03:41.221,00:03:42.723,-For what?
00:03:42.764,00:03:45.934,You have to sign up.
00:03:46.226,00:03:47.978,"Well, they explained it in the Times."
00:03:48.020,00:03:51.190,I guess he was choosing representational targets.
00:03:51.314,00:04:00.115,"So, like, all the stuff he talks about, the environment, computers, cloning, all that-- He was sending bombs to people who represented what he was fighting against."
00:04:00.157,00:04:04.161,"Robert Wright, There's a little bit of the Unabomber in most of us."
00:04:02.325,00:04:07.831,"We may not share his approach to airing a grievance, but the grievance itself feels familiar."
00:04:07.873,00:04:09.958,"And then, here, look."
00:04:10.000,00:04:16.924,The manifesto's first sentence is absolutely crucial for the American public to understand and ought to be on the forefront of the nation's political agenda.
00:04:16.965,00:04:25.390,"I forgot what the first sentence was, but-- The industrial revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race."
00:04:25.974,00:04:27.142,See?
00:04:27.184,00:04:30.395,"See? You act like I'm crazy, but it's kind of true, right?"
00:04:40.363,00:04:43.408,"the Washington Post, you have to be on the list."
00:04:58.381,00:05:08.850,"Dear David, I'll begin by saying this letter is not to be construed as an apology, and my feelings about Linda have not changed."
00:05:09.684,00:05:18.359,"However, I find myself at a strange crossroads in my life, and I'm in need of some fraternal advice."
00:05:19.319,00:05:29.871,A certain activity which has been very time-consuming for nearly the entirety of my adult life now seems to have become no longer necessary.
00:05:29.913,00:05:32.332,Forgive me if I say no more than that.
00:05:34.835,00:05:36.586,"Hey, Ted."
00:05:41.508,00:05:46.429,"David, you know I've always had trouble connecting with people."
00:05:46.471,00:05:52.019,"I just can't tell what they're feeling, what they're really thinking about."
00:05:52.060,00:05:54.729,How was school?
00:05:57.274,00:05:59.151,She said it was fine.
00:05:59.193,00:06:11.412,"My whole life, I've felt like I'm watching the world from the other side of a window, and I just don't know how to pass through to the other side, where everything is effortless."
00:06:14.082,00:06:16.417,"David, I need to know."
00:06:16.459,00:06:19.504,How do you know if it's too late to change?
00:06:20.379,00:06:26.385,How can you tell if it's still possible to begin again?
00:06:29.890,00:06:33.060,to be a freak from the start.
00:06:37.564,00:06:44.238,"I still blame Mom and Dad for that, skipping me two grades ahead."
00:06:44.487,00:06:46.405,I wasn't ready.
00:07:09.512,00:07:14.684,But the worst part was I was still smarter than everyone else.
00:07:20.607,00:07:26.487,"I never told you about Doug, but I think that's where this all began."
00:07:26.529,00:07:35.997,"I know that's where this all began, because that was my first one, my very first experiment."
00:07:54.641,00:08:01.231,"Even 40 years later, I guess you can say that Doug was the only real friend I ever had."
00:08:10.531,00:08:17.497,"Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!"
00:08:17.998,00:08:20.292,Lift off!
00:09:29.652,00:09:31.405,Aah!
00:09:33.407,00:09:34.615,Get him!
00:09:34.657,00:09:35.909,Get him out of here!
00:09:35.950,00:09:37.536,Get out of here!
00:12:03.931,00:12:05.933,Aah!
00:12:13.066,00:12:14.442,"Hey, Timmy."
00:12:18.905,00:12:21.408,What'd you learn in math today?
00:12:21.449,00:12:31.000,"Miss Chipman sucks, and these quadratics are just giving me a headache, and she can't even explain why we'd ever use one."
00:12:32.544,00:12:33.920,She can't?
00:12:33.961,00:12:35.129,No.
00:12:35.838,00:12:38.883,But they're everywhere.
00:12:39.426,00:12:44.097,"Wh-When you throw a ball, when you shoot a gun, that's quadratics."
00:12:44.847,00:12:49.810,"David, I keep asking how'd I go from this innocent little kid to this?"
00:12:49.852,00:12:51.438,...Have that equation.
00:12:51.479,00:12:54.357,I think it was Harvard that did it.
00:12:54.399,00:13:02.240,"You don't know about that, either, about Murray, about everything."
00:13:07.954,00:13:12.833,"Can you imagine how lonely that was, to be in college at 16?"
00:14:08.931,00:14:14.895,"all of the evidences, -to the students."
00:14:14.937,00:14:22.779,"Professor Henry Murray, he was everything I wanted to be, a beaming Greek god of Harvardness."
00:14:23.822,00:14:26.324,and as efficiently as possible.
00:14:26.366,00:14:28.409,I have full confidence in you.
00:14:42.965,00:14:48.012,"His was a hand of God, separating sheep from goats."
00:15:01.860,00:15:06.364,"Gentleman, if I call your number, please stand and remain standing."
00:15:06.406,00:15:16.374,"Number 1, 5, 21, 24, 47, and 89."
00:15:16.416,00:15:19.960,"If you are standing, thank you for your participation today."
00:15:20.002,00:15:22.630,You may leave now.
00:15:22.672,00:15:27.968,Please keep your papers face-down until I say begin.
00:15:28.010,00:15:29.888,Begin.
00:15:29.929,00:15:50.450,"Number 4, 7, 8, 15, 23, 37, 42, 61, 80, 91, 96."
00:15:52.869,00:15:54.995,Congratulations.
00:15:55.037,00:15:57.832,"If you're still here, you've made the cut."
00:15:57.874,00:16:00.960,Individual sessions will start next week.
00:16:07.049,00:16:13.723,Nobody in my life ever asked me how I was doing or if I was okay or even if I knew what time it was.
00:16:13.765,00:16:16.225,"Theodore, thank you for coming by."
00:16:16.267,00:16:22.064,"And here was this Harvard professor asking me what I thought about the world, listening."
00:16:22.106,00:16:23.650,It's a wonderful office you have.
00:16:23.691,00:16:26.986,"Taking notes, even, when I spoke. Imagine that."
00:16:27.194,00:16:32.533,It was as if Christ himself came down and asked me about my life.
00:16:32.826,00:16:41.000,"Well, we work so hard to justify emotional responses with morality that the-- the moral code becomes so attenuated as to be meaningless."
00:16:42.042,00:16:44.712,And do you think that that's an inevitability?
00:16:44.754,00:16:46.965,I think it has to be specific to each individual...
00:16:47.006,00:16:48.967,It was almost a year of that.
00:16:49.008,00:16:52.011,Those weekly trips to the annex were like heaven to me.
00:16:52.386,00:17:00.144,"I mean, science thinks it has this perfect, empirical evidence of everything in the universe, but it actually can't tell us anything about people."
00:17:03.063,00:17:05.399,Two poodles looking at each other.
00:17:05.441,00:17:09.320,there's a sense in which freedom is only what we call it?
00:17:09.362,00:17:12.156,"Call it prison and not, say, a monastery."
00:17:12.198,00:17:16.953,What makes a monastery different from a prison is that the monks can leave if they wanted to.
00:17:18.746,00:17:21.833,"...science, we read this article about stress effects in mice."
00:17:21.875,00:17:26.337,"You put two mice in a cage, and they're fine-- happy, live long lives."
00:17:26.671,00:17:32.092,"You put 20 mice in the same cage, it messes them up psychologically."
00:17:36.347,00:17:42.144,that technological society is incompatible with individual freedom.
00:17:42.186,00:17:47.233,"And, therefore, we have to destroy it and replace it with a more primitive society so that people can be free again."
00:17:47.274,00:17:49.109,Nothing was off-limits between us.
00:17:49.151,00:17:53.656,"We talked about everything, every crevice of my life, my dreams, my fears."
00:17:53.698,00:17:56.034,"I'm self-taught, you know."
00:17:56.075,00:17:58.828,My father couldn't comprehend chess.
00:17:58.870,00:18:02.040,And he appreciated me for who I really was.
00:18:02.164,00:18:06.836,"Personally, I never understood the appeal -of a woman's backside."
00:18:06.878,00:18:09.338,a Negro woman.
00:18:17.847,00:18:21.017,"Morning, Mr. Kaczynski."
00:18:21.601,00:18:24.771,"Well, maybe I'll have one, too, if we have a minute."
00:18:28.691,00:18:31.069,"Balkan Sobranies, huh?"
00:18:31.110,00:18:32.862,Good man.
00:18:32.904,00:18:36.074,"These are some friends of mine, Ted, the federal government."
00:18:39.493,00:18:42.663,He's been sharing some very interesting ideas with us.
00:18:44.415,00:18:47.585,Let's go this way.
00:18:47.627,00:18:49.169,We're trying something a little different today.
00:18:49.211,00:18:55.175,Those government men are here because this study is not just about expanding the boundaries of psychological sciences.
00:18:55.217,00:18:58.262,"You're part of something much bigger than yourself, Ted."
00:18:58.512,00:19:01.682,This is important for the future of the free world.
00:19:30.419,00:19:32.212,I can't really move.
00:19:32.254,00:19:35.215,"Well, you can walk out anytime you want."
00:19:37.051,00:19:38.427,"You know that, right, Theodore?"
00:19:38.469,00:19:40.805,"Yeah, no, I'm-- I'm okay, Professor."
00:19:40.847,00:19:42.640,Good man.
00:19:42.682,00:19:54.193,"Over the past year, you've provided us with hundreds of pages of material laying out your philosophy of life, your dreams for your own future, and the future of the world."
00:19:55.444,00:20:00.282,"It's been wonderful getting to know you, getting to see inside the deepest recesses of your mind."
00:20:00.324,00:20:07.874,"I hope that you feel that you've been fully honest with me, that your work truly represents who you are and what you believe."
00:20:09.458,00:20:12.670,"I've really enjoyed our conversations and the assignments, too."
00:20:12.712,00:20:14.588,I wouldn't hold anything back from you.
00:20:16.298,00:20:18.217,Let's begin.
00:20:26.893,00:20:34.108,"I've taken the liberty of sharing those pages with a panel of fellow scientists, some of Harvard's most distinguished thinkers."
00:20:36.318,00:20:39.238,-Good morning.
00:20:36.318,00:20:42.158,"-Unfortunately, their conclusions were unanimous."
00:20:47.329,00:20:50.457,The remainder they found self-evidently absurd.
00:20:51.084,00:20:56.547,"Well, professor, I'd be happy to explain myself further-- Let's take a look at the film from our last session."
00:20:57.715,00:21:00.259,I'll help clarify their findings.
00:21:08.101,00:21:20.279,"that technological society is incompatible with individual freedom, and, therefore, we have to destroy it and replace it with a more primitive society so that people can be free."
00:21:20.320,00:21:25.534,"Our reviewers found this to be a tepid, sophomoric regurgitation of Jacques Ellul."
00:21:25.952,00:21:33.084,"You talk so much about autonomy, but you've stolen all of your ideas from a third-rate thinker's mass-market paperback."
00:21:33.126,00:21:37.255,"Well, I didn't claim that my ideas were-- Here's the best part!"
00:21:37.296,00:21:43.594,"structures that it's created have made the individual passive, powerless, trapped by rules."
00:21:43.636,00:21:45.512,Delusional self-justification.
00:21:45.554,00:21:49.683,"If only I were born among cavemen, then I would have been a star."
00:21:49.725,00:21:52.812,It couldn't be your own inadequacy that's to blame.
00:21:52.853,00:21:59.359,"Well, that's totally ad hominem. I-- It couldn't be just a mediocre mathematician grasping to some justification of his own failures."
00:21:59.401,00:22:06.366,"No, it must be that the whole system is completely wrong, because, of course, you're more perceptive than anybody else."
00:22:07.243,00:22:08.661,"Right, Ted?"
00:22:08.702,00:22:12.748,We have to shed all of the unnatural stuff and get back to nature.
00:22:22.424,00:22:24.218,-You'd probably enjoy it.
00:22:24.260,00:22:25.803,"Now, now."
00:22:24.260,00:22:28.514,I told you not to bring up Theodore's sadomasochistic tendencies.
00:22:28.555,00:22:30.390,That's not fair.
00:22:30.432,00:22:33.393,and they'll respect me.
00:22:33.435,00:22:38.398,"They'll hear my ideas and see that I'm right, and they'll make me the ruler of the world."
00:22:38.440,00:22:43.403,"When I wrote your mother to get permission for this study, she didn't just sign the permission slip."
00:22:43.445,00:22:46.240,She sent a whole letter back in return.
00:22:46.282,00:22:50.995,I'm afraid Theodore is in desperate need of psychological intervention.
00:22:51.037,00:22:54.207,Many people regularly call him a creep.
00:22:55.666,00:22:57.668,Mom-- Mom wouldn't say that.
00:22:59.461,00:23:07.970,"He's a bed-wetter, and he masturbates so excessively that I worry about his mental and physical ramifications."
00:23:09.305,00:23:15.435,He harbors delusions of grandeur completely out of proportion to his mental and physical capabilities.
00:23:15.477,00:23:20.566,Anything you could do to fix my boy would have my permission.
00:23:22.109,00:23:23.319,Wanda Kaczynski.
00:23:43.172,00:23:45.216,His mother really wrote that?
00:23:45.258,00:23:47.885,the same letter for all of them.
00:23:47.927,00:23:53.307,"I imagine we could get even better results with more customized verbiage, but I'd prefer to have this phase be standardized."
00:23:53.349,00:23:56.852,handed over the reins of how our society develops.
00:23:56.894,00:24:01.232,"found this out years later, but it's well documented."
00:24:01.274,00:24:14.161,"Murray was part of MKUltra, the C.I.A.'s vast mind-control project, working to perfect brainwashing techniques to use against Soviet spies to break them permanently and change their core beliefs."
00:24:15.495,00:24:18.456,And we were the guinea pigs.
00:24:19.541,00:24:22.711,He selected the most vulnerable to see if we could be broken.
00:24:24.338,00:24:27.465,"And the other kids, they were at least 18 or 19."
00:24:28.592,00:24:30.886,I was 16 years old.
00:24:45.776,00:24:48.404,Let's get those electrodes off.
00:25:02.584,00:25:06.755,"Theodore, you did a wonderful job."
00:25:06.797,00:25:09.967,You truly exceeded my expectations.
00:25:10.092,00:25:13.304,You did so very well.
00:25:14.638,00:25:17.808,I couldn't have asked for more as a subject or as a friend.
00:25:20.727,00:25:23.897,I can't wait to see how well you do next time.
00:25:25.399,00:25:26.984,Next time?
00:25:27.026,00:25:30.196,This phase will continue for about 18 months.
00:25:30.446,00:25:33.531,"I'm anticipating more great things from you, Ted."
00:25:34.616,00:25:37.577,Oh. Um...
00:25:37.619,00:25:40.580,"I never believed any of that stuff anyway, you know?"
00:25:41.623,00:25:47.338,I thought you believed strongly-- I never really believed any of it.
00:25:47.380,00:25:54.928,"Those ideas were just-- Well, they were stupid, juvenile."
00:25:54.970,00:25:59.225,"Well, either way."
00:26:02.269,00:26:05.439,I will see you next week.
00:26:09.276,00:26:10.861,Ted?
00:26:14.407,00:26:16.409,Your cigarettes.
00:26:49.733,00:26:52.403,- Ted.
00:26:54.113,00:26:57.283,"Uh, I'm finished, and I saw where you tried to trick me."
00:26:57.699,00:27:00.660,Nice try.
00:27:00.702,00:27:03.789,"Oh, well, Timmy, see?"
00:27:04.498,00:27:07.625,Got a good head for mathematics.
00:27:12.172,00:27:14.091,"Actually, can I ask you a question..."
00:27:15.717,00:27:18.137,I can't really ask my mom.
00:27:22.600,00:27:24.684,Theresa?
00:27:24.726,00:27:25.852,Can we go for a walk?
00:27:25.894,00:27:28.355,"Oh, yeah, sure."
00:27:31.066,00:27:34.153,every single day.
00:27:34.194,00:27:38.073,"They call me pigeon-boy, and they bend my fingers back."
00:27:38.115,00:27:43.329,"And my mom, she just says, Be yourself, but that's mom stuff."
00:27:43.370,00:27:45.705,I need man-to-man advice.
00:27:45.747,00:27:49.709,"they prey on fear and weakness, and they respect only strength."
00:27:49.751,00:27:52.921,"You should be doing push-ups, sit-ups, every day."
00:27:52.963,00:27:55.715,"Soon, they'll sense your strength, and they'll leave you alone."
00:27:55.757,00:27:57.717,You won't even need to fight them.
00:27:57.759,00:27:59.303,That's good dad advice.
00:27:59.345,00:28:00.971,I'll start tonight.
00:28:01.013,00:28:04.183,"If they try to mess with me, bam."
00:28:04.766,00:28:06.726,-I'll make them pay.
00:28:06.768,00:28:09.605,That's the beauty of it.
00:28:09.647,00:28:10.981,I want to.
00:28:11.023,00:28:13.317,I want to get even.
00:28:15.902,00:28:18.780,"You don't need to get even, Timmy."
00:28:18.822,00:28:20.698,You don't.
00:28:25.245,00:28:31.793,"What the world thinks about you, what those bullies say about you, none of it matters."
00:28:31.835,00:28:33.337,You are different from those kids.
00:28:33.379,00:28:35.755,That's a good thing.
00:28:35.797,00:28:37.715,You do see the world differently.
00:28:37.757,00:28:42.721,"That's a good thing, and that's not mom stuff."
00:28:43.055,00:28:50.563,"It takes incredible strength and courage to be different from everybody else, but it's a good thing."
00:28:50.604,00:28:52.814,I promise you.
00:28:52.856,00:28:54.900,Hey.
00:28:54.941,00:28:57.194,I promise you.
00:28:58.820,00:29:00.906,All right.
00:29:02.199,00:29:04.743,"Oh, hold on a second."
00:29:10.624,00:29:12.751,-Do you think you can come?
00:29:10.624,00:29:14.587,"-Oh, well-- You don't need to bring a present or anything."
00:29:14.628,00:29:16.589,-We'll have a cake.
00:29:25.305,00:29:26.640,It-- It's just a small party.
00:29:26.682,00:29:29.268,-Yeah.
00:29:29.309,00:29:30.810,"Um, you don't have to come, though."
00:29:30.852,00:29:33.855,"No, I want to come."
00:29:30.852,00:29:37.651,I just-- I'm... busy.
00:29:38.193,00:29:41.113,You don't have to if you don't want to.
00:29:41.154,00:29:44.324,"I'll try, okay?"
00:29:44.617,00:29:45.784,Okay?
00:29:45.825,00:29:48.454,Yeah.
00:29:48.495,00:29:51.582,"Now, you-- You get on back, now."
00:29:51.624,00:29:54.793,All right.
00:29:54.918,00:30:04.261,"Murray spent a year seducing me and then spent two years breaking me, two years."
00:30:04.303,00:30:07.180,Why'd I keep going back?
00:30:07.222,00:30:14.730,"To prove to them that they can strap me into an electric chair, but I will never give in."
00:30:14.772,00:30:17.524,They will never break me.
00:30:17.566,00:30:19.401,And they didn't.
00:30:19.443,00:30:22.404,I didn't break.
00:30:22.446,00:30:25.616,They did not break me.
00:32:27.946,00:32:30.824,I can stop now.
00:32:30.866,00:32:33.952,I can stop.
00:32:34.077,00:32:40.959,"But every time my mind drifts, it goes back to that room at Harvard."
00:32:42.001,00:32:56.433,"Whenever I close my eyes, I'm there, strapped to that chair, helpless, angry, impotent, stripped of all respect, and I feel so much anger."
00:33:22.584,00:33:25.754,I've been living on anger my whole life.
00:33:35.096,00:33:36.389,-Mom...
00:33:36.431,00:33:38.266,You made me look bad to Professor Murray!
00:33:38.308,00:33:40.477,-Why would you write that letter?
00:33:40.519,00:33:43.062,I signed a permission slip because you asked me to.
00:33:43.104,00:33:45.106,...Doug...
00:33:45.148,00:33:47.985,Murray...
00:33:48.026,00:33:50.069,"and you, too, David."
00:33:52.197,00:33:54.908,Even you.
00:33:54.950,00:33:57.369,I'm going to get you!
00:33:57.410,00:33:59.705,Now I'm going to get you!
00:34:19.098,00:34:22.060,Roll back.
00:34:22.268,00:34:24.354,Couple times.
00:34:47.794,00:34:50.047,You better take these down.
00:34:47.794,00:34:51.464,People are-- Ted.
00:34:51.506,00:34:53.091,"Ted, stop it."
00:34:53.132,00:34:54.426,Stop.
00:34:54.467,00:34:56.344,Ted.
00:34:58.263,00:35:00.223,Hello? Hey!
00:35:00.265,00:35:03.142,"Hey! Okay, fine!"
00:35:20.243,00:35:23.204,Betrayal after betrayal after betrayal...
00:35:29.210,00:35:31.880,...till I couldn't trust anyone.
00:35:33.924,00:35:37.094,I want them to listen to me.
00:35:37.970,00:35:41.139,I want them to pay for what they did to me.
00:36:14.673,00:36:17.342,They will not ignore me.
00:36:37.487,00:36:40.657,used to make sense to me once.
00:36:40.991,00:36:50.208,"It all used to feel justified, but now, when I think back on it all, how many years have I spent here at this table?"
00:36:51.292,00:36:58.091,"Every time, I think, This is the one that's finally going to make me feel good, feel happy."
00:36:58.133,00:37:01.219,But it never does.
00:37:01.720,00:37:14.774,"Sometimes, I think I'm just trying to punish those people because they have what I really want-- a home, a family, the ability to be normal."
00:37:17.318,00:37:22.157,"I am 53 years old, and I'm a virgin."
00:37:23.616,00:37:40.008,"And I realize only now that the time I've spent on all this destruction is the time I would have spent on a family, having a son, someone who would look up to me, who I could just... love."
00:38:24.719,00:38:27.889,I gave up everything for respect.
00:38:32.227,00:38:35.313,But what I really want is...
00:39:16.437,00:39:19.149,My past doesn't have to dictate my future.
00:39:19.191,00:39:20.817,Does it?
00:39:20.859,00:39:23.236,I can still grow.
00:39:23.278,00:39:25.613,I can still change.
00:39:25.655,00:39:27.406,Can't I?
00:40:05.362,00:40:07.864,"-Oh, nice!"
00:41:23.398,00:41:26.484,My life wasn't supposed to go like this.
00:41:50.591,00:41:57.474,"By God, damn it, it wasn't supposed to go like this."
00:00:06.208,00:00:17.041,A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES BASED ON TRUE EVENTS.

00:00:30.666,00:00:33.375,-You know everyone here. -Everyone but you.
00:00:34.000,00:00:38.000,I work for the phone company. We're looking at putting up a new tower.
00:00:38.083,00:00:40.125,"To make phones work better, you need a closer signal."
00:00:40.208,00:00:44.541,"When I win the lottery and get a cell phone, I will send you a thank-you."
00:00:45.083,00:00:49.541,We have a field crew. They're coming up tomorrow to survey some locations.
00:00:49.625,00:00:53.333,I would like to have them stay here. If you're not too full.
00:00:53.416,00:00:56.625,I've got more rooms than you know what to do with.
00:00:57.166,00:01:00.416,"-I ain't lying, I appreciate the business. -Thank you."
00:01:00.541,00:01:03.916,"Now, you are in cabin six, right down there to your left."
00:01:04.083,00:01:06.583,Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
00:01:30.291,00:01:34.000,"Got two teams in place, three more on the ground within the week."
00:01:34.583,00:01:36.583,Won't the locals notice new faces?
00:01:36.666,00:01:41.250,It takes one local to make one comment to Ted Kaczynski and he's gone forever.
00:01:41.791,00:01:44.958,"Or worse, he booby-traps the woods, fortifies his cabin."
00:01:46.375,00:01:49.458,"Well, we're pulling the top surveillance teams."
00:01:49.541,00:01:54.041,"Our guys are being extremely careful. It's a slow-build operation, deep cover."
00:01:54.833,00:02:01.666,"Plus, Kaczynski hasn't set foot outside his cabin, so, he's not seeing or hearing much of anything."
00:02:01.750,00:02:04.125,We're paralyzed until we get a warrant.
00:02:04.208,00:02:10.833,"Until he slips up and gives us a probable cause for a search, -watch and wait's the only move we got. -How long?"
00:02:10.916,00:02:13.541,"I'm guessing three months, maybe six."
00:02:13.625,00:02:15.833,Depends on what we can build.
00:02:15.916,00:02:22.125,He could send his next incriminating letter tomorrow or walk out the door holding a bomb next week.
00:02:22.208,00:02:28.291,"We can't move in until they find something that links Kaczynski to UNABOM, something more than language."
00:02:28.375,00:02:32.875,"Fitz is comparing Kaczynski docs with UNABOM docs, but no precedent for it."
00:02:32.958,00:02:36.333,-We need something concrete. -Let's keep up the momentum.
00:02:36.416,00:02:39.041,"Remember, whatever agents you need, you get."

00:03:04.125,00:03:06.250,-Who called you? -Who didn't call me?
00:03:07.250,00:03:10.375,You poached men from half the FBI field offices.
00:03:10.458,00:03:12.291,What did you think would happen?
00:03:12.375,00:03:15.458,Every call I get is a new SAC begging for your blood.
00:03:15.541,00:03:18.708,Got multiple Bureau sources telling me Polish last name.
00:03:19.000,00:03:21.375,"Lincoln, Montana. Ted-something-inski."
00:03:21.458,00:03:23.833,I don't wanna be here. I didn't pursue this.
00:03:23.916,00:03:26.541,I'll be damned if I let ABC get there first.
00:03:26.625,00:03:30.166,Do you have any idea what a huge favor I'm doing for you now?
00:03:30.291,00:03:34.875,"If this was ABC, NBC or PBS, none of these guys would be giving you the heads-up."
00:03:34.958,00:03:37.750,"You'd be watching it on live TV right now, okay?"
00:03:37.833,00:03:40.458,Count your lucky stars that CBS got it first.
00:03:40.541,00:03:45.291,"And in the spirit of public service, we're gonna hold this story for 24 hours."
00:03:45.375,00:03:47.541,Twenty-four hours? Listen to me.
00:03:47.625,00:03:52.833,"If you break this before we get in, and he hears... He's got guns. He's got bombs."
00:03:52.916,00:03:56.000,"Twenty-four hours, then we go live. Good luck, Don."
00:04:01.500,00:04:10.250,MAIN TITLE We're screwed. How are we gonna go from a six-month timeline to one day?
00:04:10.333,00:04:12.541,"I know, but this is what we have."
00:04:12.625,00:04:15.333,Get on a plane to Helena. I want boots on the ground.
00:04:15.416,00:04:19.125,"Have to call in favors. San Francisco, SWAT, local forestries."
00:04:19.208,00:04:22.833,Take whatever you need! Got 24 hours before this blows up.
00:04:22.916,00:04:24.708,Fitz? Genelli?
00:04:24.791,00:04:29.416,Get on the phone right away. Every car rental plate within a hundred miles.
00:04:29.500,00:04:32.083,I've got Steve Freccero at the DOJ on alert.
00:04:32.666,00:04:36.458,"Write up a warrant. When Freccero signs off on it, we'll submit it."
00:04:37.000,00:04:40.583,Take whatever you need and whoever you need to get this done.
00:04:40.666,00:04:41.666,I'll work on the affidavit.
00:04:41.750,00:04:44.916,Only thing that ties Kaczynski to Unabomber is language.
00:04:45.000,00:04:46.708,Right. Write it up quickly.
00:04:46.791,00:04:51.375,But we have to get probable cause. Is forensic linguistics gonna be enough?
00:04:52.833,00:04:56.125,You've been insisting for the last month you had proof!
00:04:56.208,00:04:59.833,-What are you talking about?! Write it up! -I should've said...
00:05:24.083,00:05:26.041,"Well, cavalry's here."
00:05:43.375,00:05:45.291,-Special Agent McDaniel? -Me.
00:05:45.375,00:05:47.333,-Stan Cole. -Hell of an entrance.
00:05:47.416,00:05:49.041,"What is this, Desert Storm?"
00:05:49.375,00:05:52.750,The tip of the spear. The rest are in transit from Helena.
00:05:52.833,00:05:55.041,We'll have 100 agents within an hour.
00:05:55.125,00:05:57.541,You can mobilize 100 agents in five hours?
00:05:58.000,00:06:00.708,Did you empty out the whole San Fran office?
00:06:00.791,00:06:03.750,Whole West Coast. Now all I need is a damn warrant.
00:06:05.166,00:06:06.666,You don't have a warrant?
00:06:07.666,00:06:12.083,Here's what we're doing. You have 150 letters from Ted Kaczynski on the table.
00:06:12.166,00:06:16.000,"You have copies of the manifesto, which I know you've all read."
00:06:16.958,00:06:24.583,"And we are looking for parallel ideas, parallel concepts, parallel phrasing between the Ted letters, compared to the manifesto."
00:06:25.291,00:06:31.041,We compile as many clues as we can to prove the man who wrote those letters wrote the manifesto.
00:06:31.125,00:06:34.458,We need to find enough so no one says it's a coincidence.
00:06:35.375,00:06:36.500,So...
00:06:37.791,00:06:39.041,Needle in a haystack.
00:06:39.625,00:06:40.458,Who said that?
00:06:41.500,00:06:42.333,Who said that?
00:06:44.708,00:06:47.916,It's there. You'll find it. Do your job. Start looking.
00:06:48.041,00:06:49.708,Okay. What you got?
00:06:49.791,00:06:51.583,Teargas canister gets him out.
00:06:51.666,00:06:54.500,Operators grab him before he can cough up dinner.
00:06:55.208,00:07:01.041,He burns the evidence while igniting whatever booby-traps he set on his property and kills himself.
00:07:01.125,00:07:04.208,"-So, then what's the plan? -It's gonna be low-impact."
00:07:04.291,00:07:05.458,Nothing tactical.

00:07:20.500,00:07:21.333,Got it.
00:07:22.333,00:07:26.666,Found hundreds of language comparisons between Ted's letters and the manifesto.
00:07:26.750,00:07:30.416,Want me to send an arrest warrant to a judge based on spelling?
00:07:30.583,00:07:31.833,-Yeah. -Not just that.
00:07:31.916,00:07:34.916,You're not even close to meeting the burden of proof.
00:07:35.458,00:07:38.208,"If I'll put my name on this, you get me more."
00:07:38.291,00:07:41.250,"-That's what we have, we go in 18 hours. -Evidence."
00:07:41.500,00:07:43.583,"Probable cause, that's what I want."
00:07:43.833,00:07:45.916,I'm on your side. I'll wait here.
00:07:46.000,00:07:48.541,"If I don't see probable cause, I don't sign."
00:07:48.625,00:07:52.666,-You'll need to do better than this. -Okay. Sure. Come on.
00:07:54.083,00:07:56.458,Jerry Burns with the Forest Service.
00:07:56.541,00:08:00.541,"-You know Kaczynski personally? -I see him sometimes, riding his bike."
00:08:01.083,00:08:05.583,-I've talked to him... twice. -Which makes you practically brothers.
00:08:06.666,00:08:10.208,No one talks to Kaczynski much. Except for a librarian and a kid.
00:08:10.291,00:08:15.125,"-But he knows you. He knows who you are. -Oh, yeah, yeah. He'd recognize me."
00:08:16.875,00:08:17.708,Why?
00:08:18.500,00:08:21.916,"Well, we need to execute a warrant on Ted's cabin."
00:08:22.583,00:08:24.083,"Oh, boy."
00:08:24.875,00:08:26.166,What did Ted get into?
00:08:28.250,00:08:32.041,We have reason to believe that Ted Kaczynski is the Unabomber.
00:08:41.750,00:08:46.250,"Gosh. I mean, if he's actually the Unabomber, that's not a cabin, it's..."
00:08:48.583,00:08:49.916,That's a bomb factory.
00:08:51.791,00:08:53.708,He's been holed up over a month.
00:08:54.208,00:08:59.666,"He's barely stepped foot outside his cabin and we gotta get him out, but delicately."
00:09:01.333,00:09:05.666,"That's why I called you, Jerry. You're the Unabomber's best friend."
00:09:06.208,00:09:08.875,You are gonna lure him out for us.
00:09:19.125,00:09:20.958,"No, no, not after this..."
00:09:26.875,00:09:28.750,"That's Cole, again."
00:09:45.208,00:09:48.041,"Okay, we're moving forward. Team leaders step in."
00:09:49.375,00:09:51.916,-What is this? -It's everything we've got.
00:09:52.000,00:09:55.208,I didn't ask for more of the same. I asked for better.
00:09:55.291,00:09:56.916,"I need a smoking gun, guys."
00:09:57.000,00:10:03.125,"Can be language, but if I'm submitting this to a judge, I need to prove that I made a solid call."
00:10:03.208,00:10:05.791,"Is this about protecting your career, Steve?"
00:10:06.791,00:10:09.500,About protecting the United States Constitution.
00:10:09.583,00:10:12.458,We're down to the wire. I'm not gonna lose this guy.
00:10:12.541,00:10:15.750,"Find a smoking gun, I can't sign anything until you do."
00:10:15.833,00:10:19.333,Freccero won't sign. He says he needs a smoking gun.
00:10:19.500,00:10:20.625,Are you kidding me?
00:10:21.125,00:10:24.708,"Listen, Fitz. This op is a go."
00:10:24.791,00:10:27.500,We're arresting him at dawn. You got six hours.
00:10:27.583,00:10:29.333,You will get that warrant.

00:20:28.166,00:20:29.791,And try not to get blown up.

00:21:43.375,00:21:45.791,We get a chain saw and start cutting trees.
00:21:45.875,00:21:49.916,"You cut trees near someone's property around here, they come running."
00:21:53.791,00:21:58.416,"Say, Ted, I've got some survey guys here. They need to look at your property."
00:22:18.333,00:22:19.166,"Hi, Ted."
00:22:21.625,00:22:25.541,I got two men from Gehring's place looking to lease mineral rights.
00:22:25.625,00:22:30.000,I wanted to show them your stakes so they wouldn't trespass on your property.
00:22:35.833,00:22:38.583,My lot is clearly marked with corner stakes.
00:22:38.791,00:22:44.625,"Well, there's branches down everywhere, and I couldn't find your northeast or your southeast stakes."
00:22:45.375,00:22:47.166,Could you point them out to us?
00:23:02.333,00:23:03.416,I'll get my coat.
00:23:12.208,00:23:14.750,"Ted, if you act like a gentleman, so will we."
00:23:14.833,00:23:17.875,We have a federal warrant to search your cabin.

00:25:01.750,00:25:04.791,"-Will you remove these handcuffs, then? -No."
00:25:05.958,00:25:08.541,"If I'm not under arrest, am I free to leave?"
00:25:09.041,00:25:15.000,No. We have a search warrant that grants us the right to detain you while we search the premises.
00:25:15.541,00:25:17.750,"May I see that search warrant, please?"
00:25:18.208,00:25:20.041,When we get to the command post.
00:25:30.875,00:25:32.500,"Hey, this is Natalie Rogers."

00:25:55.291,00:25:57.250,I'll try. Is your mom around?
00:25:57.875,00:25:59.666,I wanted to tell her something.
00:26:01.583,00:26:03.583,Mom says she's asleep.
00:26:04.583,00:26:06.208,Tell her I have great news.
00:26:09.250,00:26:10.833,Mom says I have to go now.

00:32:54.708,00:32:58.916,"The first tip in the case came from Chicago, from Kaczynski's own family."
00:32:59.458,00:33:06.208,"Through a Washington attorney, a brother told the FBI he uncovered evidence suggesting his sibling might be a suspect."
00:33:06.333,00:33:11.000,Authorities then went to the family home where they recovered printed material.

00:09:00.499,00:09:02.292,What happened in there?
00:09:02.334,00:09:06.587,Did they sell you out behind closed doors with Judge Burrell?
00:09:06.629,00:09:08.465,Why?
00:09:08.507,00:09:14.179,Why would Judy Clarke write this whole motion and then sabotage it?
00:09:14.221,00:09:16.139,What's happening?
00:09:22.603,00:09:25.940,This is the defense's motion to get the search warrant thrown out.
00:09:25.982,00:09:27.984,Look at the language.
00:09:28.026,00:09:29.694,Ted wrote this whole thing himself.
00:09:29.736,00:09:34.157,Why would a lawyer let their client write the most important document in the entire case?
00:09:34.199,00:09:35.492,I don't know.
00:09:36.659,00:09:39.079,"Doesn't make sense, does it?"
00:09:41.622,00:09:45.252,Unless it's to distract him from his lawyers' real plan.
00:09:47.212,00:09:50.798,I think they're gonna try to get him off with an insanity defense.
00:09:53.427,00:09:55.512,"I saw one of his victims today, Epstein."
00:09:55.554,00:09:57.347,He shook my hand.
00:09:57.389,00:10:03.103,"He has 2 1/2 fingers now, and he'll have 2 1/2 fingers the rest of his life."
00:10:03.144,00:10:07.941,"Yet they act as if I won, that it's over."
00:10:07.982,00:10:14.573,"It's not over for Epstein until Ted is behind bars forever, not in some psych ward or on his way to supervised release."
00:10:14.614,00:10:17.909,Ted has power over every one of us as long as he's not in jail.
00:10:21.704,00:10:28.587,"You know, the first time you sat with Ted, I didn't know if you were gonna come back."
00:10:28.628,00:10:36.428,"You have all the feelings that Ted feels-- the anger, the resentment, the feelings of betrayal, the feelings like there's something so wrong with the world."
00:10:36.470,00:10:40.223,But you did the one thing that Ted could never do.
00:10:40.265,00:10:50.275,"And that was to look at Charles Epstein as a fellow human being, to look at him with a sense of empathy, to feel a sense of obligation to him."
00:10:50.317,00:10:56.531,"And if that's what is motivating you now, I think that's truly noble."
00:10:56.573,00:11:00.660,I used to think that Ted had all the answers.
00:11:00.701,00:11:03.704,Ted does have some of the answers.
00:11:03.746,00:11:06.791,"Not the ones that really matter, though."
00:11:06.833,00:11:11.296,"See, there's only one thing not accounted for in Ted's philosophy."
00:11:17.344,00:11:20.679,It's what you felt shaking Epstein's hand.
00:11:24.142,00:11:27.020,"Simple as that, huh?"
00:11:32.567,00:11:35.403,Now go.
00:11:54.922,00:11:57.758,Did you come here to gloat?
00:11:57.800,00:11:59.844,'Cause I have work to do.
00:11:59.886,00:12:02.681,I got something to show you.
00:12:15.318,00:12:17.111,Where are we?
00:12:17.153,00:12:19.614,An Air Force base.
00:13:25.888,00:13:29.850,of desperation.
00:13:29.892,00:13:33.854,I can't even-- W-W-- I-Is this supposed to intimidate me?
00:13:33.896,00:13:38.109,"You'll not only lock me up, you'll lock my house up, as well?"
00:13:38.151,00:13:42.739,"James, here's the thing you're not grasping."
00:13:45.659,00:13:47.994,The trial itself is everything.
00:13:48.035,00:13:50.871,It's gonna give me the biggest microphone in the world.
00:13:50.913,00:13:54.459,"Before, I had to threaten violence to get one manifesto published in the Post."
00:13:54.501,00:13:57.878,Now I'm gonna be piped directly into every living room in the country.
00:13:57.920,00:14:05.094,"And if you put me in a jail cell, I will spend the rest of my life appealing."
00:14:22.403,00:14:26.449,There's one possibility you didn't think of.
00:14:26.491,00:14:28.493,"On the cabin, the prosecution didn't bring it."
00:14:28.535,00:14:30.870,The defense did.
00:14:32.955,00:14:34.457,Why?
00:14:34.499,00:14:37.544,Why don't you know about it?
00:14:37.585,00:14:40.380,Thank you for having me here.
00:14:37.585,00:14:44.967,"I-I appreciate the opportunity to tell my brother's story, as-- as I understand it."
00:14:45.009,00:14:51.516,"The real story o-of Ted Kaczynski is the story of lifelong, undiagnosed mental illness."
00:14:51.558,00:14:59.774,"Some years ago, I showed his letters to a psychiatrist, who found him deeply delusional and provisionally diagnosed him with schizophrenia."
00:14:59.816,00:15:11.118,"And the clinical description of paranoid schizophrenia mirrors many of the behaviors that I've observed in Ted over the years, especially his break from society as a young man."
00:15:11.160,00:15:15.081,"news channel, every magazine, every newspaper, saying the same thing."
00:15:15.122,00:15:17.958,"He's got, like, a script he's repeating over and over."
00:15:18.000,00:15:22.046,At least Judas had the decency to hang himself.
00:15:22.088,00:15:25.759,David doesn't even believe in mental illness.
00:15:25.800,00:15:27.218,Who cares?
00:15:27.260,00:15:29.053,We'll muzzle him the moment the trial begins.
00:15:29.095,00:15:33.600,He's not the only one repeating from that script or talking to the press.
00:15:33.641,00:15:35.518,It's The New York Times.
00:15:35.560,00:15:45.653,A sealed psychological report provided by Kaczynski's lawyers suggests that Kaczynski has been suffering from mental illness since before he moved into a one-room shack in the woods in 1972.
00:15:45.695,00:15:50.491,Its findings are consistent with diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia.
00:15:52.034,00:15:54.120,They're setting you up.
00:15:54.161,00:15:56.122,Your own lawyers are working against you.
00:15:56.163,00:16:00.585,"They're the ones feeding David his lines, giving this to the press."
00:16:00.627,00:16:08.468,"And they're the ones that shipped this cabin across the country so they could bring in the jury and say, Look at this pathetic man and his pathetic cabin."
00:16:08.509,00:16:10.303,You got to be crazy to live like this.
00:16:11.387,00:16:14.849,"They can't do any of that, James."
00:16:14.891,00:16:18.352,My legal team isn't authorized to pursue a mental-defect defense.
00:16:18.394,00:16:27.111,Right. Right. You'd have to give them permission and you'd never grant it.
00:16:27.153,00:16:29.029,Ted...
00:16:29.071,00:16:35.703,"so much about the world, but you've got a big blind spot when it comes to who you choose to trust."
00:16:35.745,00:16:48.048,"You gave your lawyers permission to bring in experts to prove that you're mentally defective, and they're gonna twist everything you've ever written, everything you've ever told anybody, to fit the predetermined diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia."
00:16:48.090,00:16:55.348,"But before those experts come in, the whole world is gonna hear the diagnosis a million times on TV, in the newspapers, from David, from your own mother."
00:16:55.389,00:16:58.267,"So, the trial is just gonna be a foregone conclusion."
00:16:58.309,00:17:00.060,And you think death is the worst thing that they can do to you?
00:17:00.102,00:17:04.148,"They won't even give you that, 'cause they don't execute crazies."
00:17:06.108,00:17:07.986,There won't be any appeals.
00:17:08.027,00:17:09.487,They'll have your capacity removed.
00:17:09.529,00:17:15.994,"They're gonna stick you in an insane asylum where, slowly, you will be adjusted."
00:17:16.035,00:17:23.250,"Pills, electroshock therapy, threat, punishment, reward, till finally you're cured."
00:17:23.292,00:17:27.338,"It might take years, but it's gonna happen."
00:17:27.380,00:17:32.510,"You will be normal, and you'll rejoin society."
00:17:32.552,00:17:39.099,"You'll get a credit card, an apartment, business casual wardrobe, you know, some of those tops with the penguins on them."
00:17:39.141,00:17:44.480,"And you'll get a job behind a desk where you'll work obediently 9:00 to 5:00, and your first paycheck, you get a cellphone."
00:17:44.522,00:17:46.106,"Next one, you get a TV."
00:17:46.148,00:17:49.610,"You know, if you splurge, you can get yourself a Nintendo."
00:17:49.652,00:17:51.654,"And every night, you fall asleep watching that TV."
00:17:51.696,00:17:53.531,"And every weekend, you're gonna go to the mall."
00:17:53.573,00:17:55.157,You're gonna walk around Circuit City.
00:17:55.199,00:18:00.120,"You're gonna look at the big-screen TVs and think, Should I get myself a 20-incher?"
00:18:00.162,00:18:01.998,Or should I just keep saving up for the 27-incher?
00:18:03.165,00:18:12.008,"And, as you're thinking about this, slurping on your Orange Julius, somebody's gonna recognize you and say, Weren't you that Unabomber guy, you know, the guy that wrote all that stuff and killed all those people?"
00:18:12.050,00:18:15.344,"And you'll go, Yeah, that was me, but I was very sick."
00:18:15.386,00:18:19.139,"But I got help, and I'm much, much better now, thank you."
00:18:19.181,00:18:21.726,And then you're gonna go back to watching your TVs.
00:18:21.768,00:18:25.813,And you won't even remember that you wanted anything more than this.
00:18:25.855,00:18:29.275,"See, Ted, you predicted all this in your manifesto."
00:18:31.027,00:18:42.162,Many tame and conformist types seem to have a powerful need to depict the enemy of society as sick so as to delegitimize their valid complaints against society.
00:18:42.204,00:18:50.755,"This cabin used to be a symbol of moral courage, and now they're just gonna point to it and say you've got to be insane to live this way."
00:18:50.797,00:18:55.342,"Well, they brought the cabin, but they didn't bring the forest."
00:18:55.384,00:18:58.805,Or the rain.
00:19:00.807,00:19:03.434,It was very beautiful.
00:19:03.476,00:19:05.686,"Hey, I know it was."
00:19:25.247,00:19:35.091,"But if everyone was content to live simply like this, we'd have no more war, no poverty, no pollution."
00:19:35.133,00:19:44.642,"The truth is, if someone could hand me a pill that would make me normal, take these questions away, I might even take it..."
00:19:47.103,00:19:50.272,if it was my own choice.
00:19:50.314,00:19:53.526,Your brother keeps saying that you'd be happier in a jail cell.
00:19:53.567,00:19:56.403,Three hot meals a day.
00:19:56.445,00:19:59.406,the dimensions are about the same-- 10x12.
00:19:59.448,00:20:02.409,"say that, wouldn't he?"
00:20:02.451,00:20:06.956,"If I go to jail, he pockets a $1 million reward."
00:20:10.292,00:20:14.797,Judge and the prosecutors can brag about how the Unabomber will rot in a hole forever.
00:20:14.839,00:20:16.215,And what do I get?
00:20:18.300,00:20:21.261,I know you're not insane.
00:20:21.303,00:20:37.945,"Every time I stop at a red light or I follow the arrows in Ikea or I sit and I wait and listen for the modem to dial up, I can see the systems that control our lives, and I feel my freedom being hemmed in, and I hate it."
00:20:37.987,00:20:43.283,"What you have to say about the world, it matters to the future."
00:20:43.325,00:20:48.288,"And all I got to do is roll over and stop fighting, right?"
00:20:48.330,00:20:53.586,"Well, now, isn't that convenient, the way your own interests and mine align so perfectly?"
00:20:53.627,00:20:56.172,"No, the fight's fixed."
00:20:56.214,00:20:58.966,It's done.
00:20:59.008,00:21:02.261,"Get out of my house now, please."
00:21:04.513,00:21:06.306,Get out!
00:21:08.809,00:21:11.896,they'll call you crazy.
00:21:13.522,00:21:17.317,Or you plead guilty and go away forever.
00:21:17.359,00:21:20.362,And your ideas will live on.
00:21:43.970,00:21:46.346,We need to talk.
00:21:48.766,00:21:51.351,What did you discuss in chambers...
00:21:51.393,00:21:54.354,during the challenge to the search warrant?
00:21:54.396,00:21:55.731,I told you.
00:21:54.396,00:21:57.024,Burrell didn't want his courtroom to become a circus.
00:21:57.066,00:21:59.819,"Did you sell me out, Judy?"
00:21:59.860,00:22:01.361,Did you?
00:22:01.403,00:22:04.115,Did you go behind my back and torpedo that motion?
00:22:04.157,00:22:06.450,"Burrell called me into chambers, Ted."
00:22:06.492,00:22:07.660,Remember?
00:22:09.245,00:22:10.329,Hang on.
00:22:11.413,00:22:14.000,Contraband.
00:22:14.041,00:22:17.377,Do I have total control of my defense?
00:22:17.419,00:22:19.839,It's your defense.
00:22:19.880,00:22:23.383,"This is all about you-- every decision, every discussion."
00:22:23.425,00:22:26.595,"My entire life right now revolves around doing right by you, okay?"
00:22:26.637,00:22:30.557,"So, you will not be presenting to the court that I am mentally defective?"
00:22:30.599,00:22:31.851,"Ted, what gave you that idea?"
00:22:31.892,00:22:33.686,"the cabin, Judy."
00:22:33.727,00:22:40.693,"He showed me the cabin, that you were gonna say I'm insane, and you know that would be so much worse for me than death."
00:22:40.734,00:22:49.409,"Ted, we found out the prosecution built their own mock-up of your cabin to show the jury and that they were planning to present their own mental health testimony."
00:22:49.451,00:22:58.627,"In my legal judgment, it was prudent to ensure we'd be able to present the truth about you and your life to combat the government's distortions."
00:23:07.928,00:23:16.020,"I tried to keep you out of the trenches on this, take care of the P's and Q's so you can keep thinking big-picture for us."
00:23:16.062,00:23:18.147,But if you lack confidence in my legal judgment...
00:23:18.189,00:23:22.442,"-...if you want to read everything we've filed on your behalf, -I'm more than happy to-- -No, I'm not saying that."
00:23:22.484,00:23:29.367,"No, I'll bring in the document boxes if you want total transparency, if you want to see and approve everything, -page by page-- -No."
00:23:32.953,00:23:37.083,I trust you. I've just been betrayed by so many people.
00:23:37.124,00:23:39.585,Fitzgerald got into my head.
00:23:41.503,00:23:44.464,You know I really care about you.
00:23:50.221,00:23:52.348,before the guards see.
00:23:52.390,00:23:54.850,You'll get me into trouble.
00:24:07.654,00:24:11.491,The defense has some remaining questions regarding juror questionnaires.
00:24:11.533,00:24:18.498,"A number of the responses from juror numbers 16, 68, and 73 were illegible, and we'd like to clarify those before we move on to voir dire."
00:24:18.540,00:24:22.128,"-Uh, we couldn't read them, either, Your Honor."
00:24:22.169,00:24:23.712,I'll allow it.
00:24:23.754,00:24:25.505,Anything else before we move on?
00:24:25.547,00:24:30.552,"Yes, Your Honor. We need some clarification from the defense before we can begin jury selection."
00:24:30.594,00:24:41.521,"Uh, I have here what I believe to be motion from the defense, but their witness list includes a number of experts on paranoid schizophrenia."
00:24:42.940,00:24:44.566,"No, what is he-- What are you talking about?"
00:24:44.608,00:24:51.865,"We need clarification before beginning jury selection, Your Honor, if the defense is going to pursue a mental-defect defense and continue to-- -That is not our intention."
00:24:50.030,00:24:56.536,"-Your Honor, please, can we-- ...continue to claim that the defendant is paranoid-- Your Honor, I need a moment alone with my attorneys."
00:24:56.578,00:25:00.624,"You stood right there, and you lied to my face."
00:25:00.666,00:25:02.209,"We're saving your life, Ted."
00:25:02.251,00:25:03.919,"It's my life, Judy!"
00:25:05.171,00:25:06.339,Mine!
00:25:10.217,00:25:18.476,"You're gonna walk back in there, and you're gonna inform the court that we will not be pursuing mental-defect defense, not now, not ever."
00:25:18.516,00:25:24.898,"Whether you approve of my strategic decisions or not, I have an ethical obligation in the system to do what I have to in order to save your life."
00:25:24.940,00:25:27.567,"You're not saving my life, Judy!"
00:25:24.940,00:25:32.739,"You're saving my body, and you're saving my body by destroying my life's work!"
00:25:32.781,00:25:39.579,"Ted, you mailed bombs to innocent people so you could get some half-baked ideas published in a newspaper."
00:25:39.621,00:25:41.623,I will work around the clock to save your life.
00:25:41.665,00:25:43.792,That's my obligation as your attorney.
00:25:43.834,00:25:47.921,"But if you're not mentally defective, I don't know who is."
00:25:54.261,00:25:57.597,my relationship with my present attorneys has become untenable.
00:25:57.639,00:26:01.352,"They have admitted to lying to me, to tricking me, to betraying my trust."
00:26:01.394,00:26:06.023,They knew all along that I would rather die than be falsely portrayed as mentally ill.
00:26:06.065,00:26:13.739,"I do not want to represent myself, but right now, I see no alternative."
00:26:13.780,00:26:16.616,"I don't think so, Mr. Kaczynski."
00:26:16.658,00:26:20.620,"In my courtroom, there are no theatrics, and there are no delays."
00:26:20.662,00:26:25.583,"I may be many things, Mr. Kaczynski, but the one thing I am not is a Lance Ito."
00:26:26.626,00:26:27.794,"I'm sorry, I don't understand."
00:26:27.836,00:26:30.630,The judge in the O.J. trial.
00:26:30.672,00:26:31.798,No delay.
00:26:31.840,00:26:33.842,The trial will continue.
00:26:33.884,00:26:36.303,"Well, Your Honor, I'm not asking for a delay."
00:26:36.345,00:26:39.681,I can begin representing myself in an hour-- one hour from now.
00:26:41.641,00:26:50.608,"Based on the psychological evaluation your defense provided me, I find you mentally unsound to mount an effective defense."
00:26:52.694,00:26:57.366,Psychological evaluations that you've already considered?
00:26:59.076,00:27:01.203,Did you all discuss this beforehand?
00:27:01.245,00:27:03.914,Have you all decided how this ends?
00:27:03.956,00:27:17.177,"I'm sane enough to stand trial, sane enough to spend the rest of my life in a federal penitentiary, but I'm too insane to represent myself, too insane to be executed, and I'm guessing I'm too insane to testify and say anything about what I actually believe in."
00:27:17.219,00:27:20.556,Is that what your secret psych report said?
00:27:20.598,00:27:29.064,"Your Honor, I am afraid I have a constitutional right to represent myself, and if I have to take that to the judicial review board, I will."
00:27:29.106,00:27:30.357,you have that right.
00:27:32.734,00:27:39.699,"If you do, however, that raises the question of whether you're mentally fit to stand trial at all."
00:27:39.741,00:27:59.928,"And we can easily resolve the question of your mental competency with an observation period in a mental institution, say, starting with a 60-day stay in the care of a psych hospital, perhaps longer if the doctors find it necessary to start treatment or medication, whatever they determine is in your best interest."
00:27:59.970,00:28:04.766,"If you want to pursue this, I'll write the order now and have you remanded into their care."
00:28:06.768,00:28:08.812,I-I-I-- I need-- I need some time.
00:28:08.854,00:28:10.397,I need time to think about my options.
00:28:10.439,00:28:14.401,"You don't have time, and you don't have options."
00:28:29.667,00:28:32.878,"Your trial will continue now, Mr. Kaczynski."
00:28:32.919,00:28:36.131,These are your lawyers.
00:28:36.173,00:28:42.971,"If they say you're mentally defective, you will nod and agree in silence."
00:28:51.813,00:28:53.566,Ohh!
00:29:30.686,00:29:31.770,All right.
00:29:38.860,00:29:40.487,He's making a deal.
00:29:42.030,00:29:44.283,Ted's gonna plead guilty.
00:29:47.077,00:29:49.204,What'd you say to him?
00:29:51.582,00:29:53.459,The truth.
00:29:56.044,00:30:05.471,"Is it your understanding that your attorneys had discussions with the attorneys for the government in this case, concerning your change of plea?"
00:30:05.512,00:30:07.556,"Yes, Your Honor."
00:30:16.523,00:30:18.525,"Yes, Your Honor."
00:30:18.567,00:30:24.281,"Do you understand that, as part of this plea, you are waiving your right to appeal?"
00:30:24.323,00:30:25.824,I do.
00:30:25.865,00:30:33.666,"waiving your right to challenge any portion of this proceeding in the future, including the search warrant?"
00:30:33.707,00:30:35.751,I understand.
00:30:37.711,00:30:39.755,"Very well, then."
00:30:42.966,00:30:44.677,Guilty.
00:30:47.137,00:30:50.140,We will reconvene for sentencing.
00:30:50.182,00:30:57.356,"We will hear testimony from the victims, and you'll be able to make a statement then if you wish."
00:30:57.397,00:30:59.149,Court adjourned.
00:31:03.529,00:31:04.904,...letters that land the bombers.
00:31:04.946,00:31:09.159,"You're gonna have a long, brilliant career reading nasty letters from A-holes."
00:31:09.201,00:31:12.788,"Congrats. A big win, Fitz."
00:31:50.409,00:31:56.956,"Before we proceed with sentencing, we will hear from those victims who wish to make a statement."
00:31:56.998,00:32:05.632,"Susan Mosser, wife of Thomas Mosser, who was murdered by the defendant in December of 1994."
00:32:08.385,00:32:12.972,It was supposed to be the day my family picked out a Christmas tree.
00:32:16.017,00:32:19.979,"Instead, it was the day my husband was murdered."
00:32:20.021,00:32:34.994,"The excruciating pain of 100 nails, cut-up razor blades, and metal fragments, burning your skin, fracturing your skull, and driving shrapnel into your brain."
00:32:35.036,00:33:03.857,"Imagine what it is like to constantly wonder what would make a person want to kill you, to look down at injuries that shock you beyond belief, and to wonder what has happened and why, to be overwhelmed with the feelings of rage and the heartache of knowing that you will never again be the same as you were before."
00:33:03.899,00:33:13.032,"We've decided to let him live, so let him be our living symbol of cowardice and evil."
00:33:13.074,00:33:25.211,"It gives us a chance to look our worst instincts in the face and to say to them, You will not prevail."
00:33:27.673,00:33:31.301,Theodore Kaczynski was a victim.
00:33:31.343,00:33:36.515,"By some convoluted form of logic, you've portrayed yourself as a victim."
00:33:36.556,00:33:42.521,"As you start your life sentence in prison, this is what I wish for you."
00:33:59.120,00:34:06.503,"Given that your victims lost their hearing because of your bombs, may you spend the rest of your days in stony silence."
00:34:06.545,00:34:18.348,"And given that your victims were maimed by your bombs, may your body be shackled with the same violence and hatred that have already imprisoned your mind."
00:34:18.390,00:34:32.111,"And given that your victims were killed by your bombs, may your own death occur as you have lived-- in a solitary manner, without compassion or love."
00:34:34.155,00:34:40.829,The defendant will now have an opportunity to make a statement if he wishes.
00:35:05.478,00:35:18.366,I only ask that people reserve their judgment about me and about the Unabom case until all the facts have been made public.
00:35:18.408,00:35:21.160,There is so much that...
00:35:25.290,00:35:27.626,"I'm not, um..."
00:35:43.100,00:35:59.407,"In keeping with the terms of the plea arrangement, I sentence Theodore Kaczynski to life in prison, plus a 30-year consecutive prison sentence, plus three additional life prison terms to be served consecutively."
00:35:59.449,00:36:05.038,The defendant committed unspeakable and monstrous crimes.
00:36:05.080,00:36:12.337,"I believe that if he had the opportunity, he would use his resourcefulness to repeat such acts."
00:36:12.378,00:36:17.676,"Because of the callous nature of his crimes, the defendant presents a grave danger to society."
00:36:27.727,00:36:34.985,I only wish the suffering I could impose on you would in any way match the suffering of the men and women here.
00:36:35.027,00:36:36.528,This matter is adjourned.
00:36:43.493,00:36:49.041,"Ladies and gentlemen, David Kaczynski is the real hero of the Unabom story."
00:36:49.082,00:36:51.126,He came forward when no one else would.
00:36:51.168,00:36:56.965,"And, after legal expenses, he will be donating all of the reward money to the victims and their families."
00:36:57.007,00:36:59.217,He is truly an American hero.
00:37:04.305,00:37:06.725,I have a statement to read.
00:37:06.766,00:37:19.571,"Speaking for my mother, Wanda, my wife, Linda, and other members of our family, I would like to say that our reaction to today's plea agreement is one of deep relief."
00:37:19.612,00:37:29.539,"We feel it is the appropriate, just, and civilized resolution to this tragedy in light of Ted's diagnosed mental illness."
00:37:29.581,00:37:36.295,We'd like to thank the FBI for their care in investigating this case and protecting the public safety.
00:37:39.340,00:37:43.261,It's really over.
00:38:41.111,00:38:42.320,Look straight ahead.
00:38:43.404,00:38:45.573,Look to your right.
00:38:46.616,00:38:48.243,Look to your left.
00:38:49.452,00:38:50.620,Open your mouth.
00:38:50.662,00:38:53.372,Wide.
00:38:53.414,00:38:55.374,Lift your left leg.
00:38:55.416,00:38:58.336,Right leg up.
00:38:58.377,00:39:01.380,"At this point, I want all your clothes off. Strip naked."
00:39:01.422,00:39:04.467,Arms straight up.
00:39:04.509,00:39:07.386,Bend over.
00:39:07.428,00:39:09.264,"Two loud, forceful coughs."
00:39:38.293,00:39:42.005,Both knees up on the bed.
00:39:42.047,00:39:45.550,Left hand.
00:39:45.591,00:39:47.219,Right foot.
00:39:50.847,00:39:52.640,Look at the wall.
00:39:58.479,00:40:01.191,Stay on your knees until we leave.
00:40:40.397,00:40:43.441,"So, now what?"
00:40:48.487,00:40:49.530,Don't know.
00:40:50.823,00:40:53.451,"Anything we want, right?"
