00:03:20.533,00:03:22.327,"Oh, how big is he gonna be?"
00:03:22.619,00:03:29.834,"Saint Bernards get to be I got a junkyard. I need a big, mean junkyard dog."
00:03:31.502,00:03:32.921,Let me see him.

00:04:28.559,00:04:30.853,You're crazy if you're just gonna walk up just like this.
00:04:47.287,00:04:49.330,All you gotta do is step over it.
00:04:54.335,00:04:56.004,"-I got you. -Okay, okay."
00:04:56.087,00:04:57.672,"-Look, I got you. -Okay. Okay."
00:04:57.755,00:04:59.882,"There, you see? In and out, quiet as a mouse."
00:04:59.966,00:05:01.467,Let's get some dogs.
00:05:07.598,00:05:10.018,"Oh, look. Look, it's a wee little one, too."
00:05:10.101,00:05:12.770,"Come here, you little puppies. Here we go."
00:05:24.866,00:05:26.242,I've stepped in the beam.
00:06:09.077,00:06:11.913,"Here, puppy. Nice puppy."
00:06:26.928,00:06:28.387,See? Didn't I tell you?
00:06:28.471,00:06:30.723,Doesn't this beat taking strays off the street?
00:06:30.807,00:06:33.518,-You are such a genius! -Get off!
00:06:42.735,00:06:46.155,I'm just a little bit excited. That was my very first felony.
00:06:47.740,00:06:51.536,"I've committed a lot of misdemeanors, but I do believe that was my very first felony."
00:07:07.635,00:07:08.845,Why are they barking?
00:07:09.971,00:07:10.805,They're dogs.
00:07:11.431,00:07:14.183,I know they're dogs. Go in the back and check.
00:07:17.603,00:07:21.858,"Okay, doggies, what's the racket back-- Hey!"
00:07:22.191,00:07:24.444,"Okay, doggies, back in your house."
00:07:25.570,00:07:28.281,"Back in your house, doggie. Here, doggie, nice doggie."
00:07:31.075,00:07:32.410,"No, doggie. Don't jump."
00:07:35.580,00:07:36.998,Bad dog. Puppy.
00:07:37.081,00:07:38.332,Good puppy. Good...
00:07:38.666,00:07:40.418,Bad puppy. Don't jump!
00:07:40.543,00:07:41.878,"Good puppy. Don't jump, puppy."
00:07:42.170,00:07:43.963,Come back. Stop the van!
00:07:46.007,00:07:46.841,"Harv, what is it?"
00:07:46.924,00:07:49.051,Why did you want me to stop? What's the matter?
00:07:49.135,00:07:50.386,"Hurry, they're getting away."
00:07:55.057,00:07:58.269,Come here! I'll give you a bone! I'll give you a bone!
00:07:58.352,00:08:00.354,"Come back here, you little runt!"
00:10:32.131,00:10:33.591,7:00 a.m. Up and at 'em!
00:10:48.439,00:10:50.441,"Oh, Ted, I'm sorry."
00:10:52.777,00:10:54.904,What's wrong? Did you have another nightmare?
00:10:54.987,00:10:56.197,Yeah.
00:10:58.157,00:11:02.453,"Mom, it's Saturday and it's 7:02. Do we really have to get up?"
00:11:02.912,00:11:04.872,"Yep, you heard your father."
00:11:24.683,00:11:27.520,"Mom, I have a news flash for you. It's Saturday!"
00:11:35.152,00:11:36.737,The bathroom's mine!
00:11:42.910,00:11:45.287,"Open up, you little wimp! Let me in!"
00:12:01.595,00:12:02.972,A puppy.
00:12:04.807,00:12:06.100,Hi.
00:12:11.939,00:12:17.528,"Okay. All right, guys, do you have to-- Mom, look, I dreamt I had a puppy, and it came true."
00:12:25.369,00:12:26.370,Mmm.
00:12:26.454,00:12:29.457,I take back almost everything I ever said about you being cold and insensitive.
00:12:30.708,00:12:33.502,"Dad, I take back anything I ever said about you, too."
00:12:33.586,00:12:36.380,"Dad, I have everything I ever wanted."
00:12:36.464,00:12:38.382,-I owe you big time. -Why?
00:12:39.425,00:12:41.343,"Daddy, can we call him Fred?"
00:12:45.723,00:12:48.767,"-Let me have him. It's my turn. -No, it's my turn."
00:12:48.851,00:12:52.480,-I saw him first! -I'm gonna have him for five more minutes.
00:12:54.482,00:12:58.110,We can't have a dog. We can't have a dog.
00:12:58.444,00:13:01.197,"Honey, you can't show a child a puppy and then take it away two minutes later."
00:13:01.280,00:13:04.033,I didn't show a child a puppy. It's obviously lost.
00:13:04.116,00:13:06.535,You occupy the kids. I'll run it down to the pound.
00:13:06.619,00:13:07.953,"Oh, no. No way."
00:13:08.037,00:13:12.208,"If the owner doesn't claim it, it'll be destroyed. I'm not gonna let-- If we keep it, the house will be destroyed."
00:13:12.291,00:13:14.376,"Honey, it's just a dog. Millions of people have dogs, you know."
00:13:14.460,00:13:16.212,"Oh, no. Not people like me."
00:13:16.295,00:13:21.258,"Dogs sniff. They lick, they chew. They drool, they scra..."
00:13:21.967,00:13:25.012,"-Alice, they have parasites. -Oh, God, yeah."
00:13:25.095,00:13:27.014,The kids will lose interest. I'll have to care for it.
00:13:27.097,00:13:29.600,It'll grow to be enormous. It'll take over the yard.
00:13:29.683,00:13:31.393,The bushes will die. The lawn will look terrible.
00:13:31.477,00:13:34.438,"And when the dog finally settles down, it'll die."
00:13:34.647,00:13:37.399,"Everybody will be so upset, we'll have to go get another puppy."
00:13:37.483,00:13:38.943,The whole thing will start all over again.
00:13:39.026,00:13:41.487,"-Do you understand? -No, honey. Could you be more specific?"
00:13:42.029,00:13:43.572,"Alice, I really could use a little support here."
00:13:43.656,00:13:45.991,"Okay, I'm sorry. All right."
00:13:54.542,00:13:55.709,Come over here.
00:13:55.793,00:13:57.503,-Come on. -Come over here.
00:14:05.511,00:14:09.223,"-He loves me the most. -Oh, yes, good doggie."
00:14:12.434,00:14:14.270,"-Hi, kids. -Hi, Dad."
00:14:14.353,00:14:17.606,"-Daddy, can he sleep in my room? -No, he's sleeping in my room."
00:14:17.690,00:14:20.192,Dream on. I'm the oldest. He's sleeping in my room.
00:14:20.276,00:14:21.902,He's not sleeping in anyone's room.
00:14:24.989,00:14:29.535,We are people people here. We are goldfish people.
00:14:29.618,00:14:31.787,"Uh, we're ant farm people."
00:14:32.496,00:14:33.622,We're not dog people.
00:14:34.081,00:14:36.458,"Dad, why can't you just give us a chance?"
00:14:36.542,00:14:38.836,"I mean, you're always saying that we have to have responsibility."
00:14:38.919,00:14:40.504,I know. That's true.
00:14:49.805,00:14:50.973,I knew it.
00:15:04.570,00:15:05.905,You'd better think of something to name him.
00:15:05.988,00:15:15.039,"Because when I come home and he destroys my house, This is just temporary until we find the owner."
00:15:17.458,00:15:20.669,"Okay, the dog's name will be..."
00:15:23.339,00:15:25.466,-What is it? -What's his name gonna be?
00:15:25.549,00:15:27.009,You can't change it. That's the rules.
00:15:27.134,00:15:29.136,Okay. Emily?
00:15:32.848,00:15:36.518,"Well, I don't think words for parts of the body make very good names, honey."
00:15:36.602,00:15:38.979,But he's got one of those. I looked.
00:15:39.063,00:15:48.447,"I'm sure he does, but I don't think that Daddy wants But that's what you call Uncle Richard."
00:15:59.792,00:16:01.085,You asked for my input.
00:16:03.545,00:16:04.588,-What? What is it? -What?
00:16:04.672,00:16:06.215,Nothing. Let's just call the dog Rover.
00:16:06.507,00:16:09.343,"-Mom, please. Come on, M.C. Hammer. -Ultimate Warrior."
00:16:12.888,00:16:15.474,He doesn't like any of those names.
00:16:16.141,00:16:17.977,"Oh, right. Like you can really read his mind."
00:16:18.060,00:16:18.894,Ryce.
00:16:19.478,00:16:21.730,"Emily, honey, what does the dog want his name to be?"
00:16:21.814,00:16:25.234,"You know, this is ridiculous. It's a dog! He doesn't have preferences."
00:16:25.317,00:16:27.987,You could call him Ding-Dong Head. He wouldn't know the difference.
00:16:28.070,00:16:29.905,"Yes, he would!"
00:16:30.280,00:16:32.825,He'll tell us what he wants to be called.
00:16:45.713,00:16:47.381,Beethoven.
00:19:41.305,00:19:45.184,"No, no, no, no! No, no, no!"
00:20:10.250,00:20:13.253,"They're talking about 25. I said, That's not gonna do me any good."
00:20:13.337,00:20:15.005,"They said, No? I said, No."
00:20:15.088,00:20:19.259,"I mean, if this thing is gonna take off, I need some capital, not a Band-Aid."
00:20:19.343,00:20:21.929,"They said, So what kind of figures are we talking about?"
00:20:22.012,00:20:25.182,"I said, Well, you know, 150 sounds like a good neighborhood to me."
00:20:25.265,00:20:26.308,Did you really say that?
00:20:26.391,00:20:29.811,"Yeah. I mean, you know, this is a business. What am I gonna do with 25?"
00:20:41.531,00:20:42.866,-when they were going over the books-- -Daddy?
00:20:42.950,00:20:43.909,What?
00:20:44.576,00:20:46.036,He wants you to scratch his head.
00:20:47.537,00:20:50.958,"Oh, you know, I don't wanna scratch his head."
00:20:51.041,00:20:53.543,"-Back off, back off! -But he wants you to."
00:20:53.627,00:20:55.379,"Well, honey, sometimes we don't get what we want."
00:20:55.462,00:20:57.422,That's not the way the world works.
00:20:57.547,00:20:59.466,"If I don't get this deal, I'll kill myself!"
00:20:59.549,00:21:02.261,"Honey, come on. Don't talk like that in front of the kids."
00:21:02.344,00:21:08.684,"You know, if I can just get them to smell the stuff, because air fresheners are such a visceral product-- -Hey, Dad, I got a great idea. -What?"
00:21:08.767,00:21:11.520,"Oh, hey, can I have karate lessons?"
00:21:12.646,00:21:15.941,"You know, I didn't get any bacon. What do you want karate lessons for?"
00:21:16.024,00:21:19.278,"Brenda Feinberg, she's littler than me, and she's got a green belt."
00:21:19.361,00:21:22.072,Why don't we just skip the lessons and get you the belt?
00:21:28.662,00:21:30.247,No! Come on!
00:21:32.624,00:21:36.420,He slimed me! He slobbed! No! Look at this!
00:21:38.338,00:21:39.965,I've got dog drool on my pants.
00:21:40.048,00:21:43.593,I can't meet with Vanguard Capital with dog drool on my pants.
00:21:43.677,00:21:45.220,"Honey, why don't you just change your pants?"
00:21:45.304,00:21:46.972,"I'm gonna change my pants, Alice."
00:21:47.055,00:21:50.684,But I had a schedule and now it's gone. I'll never have that schedule again.
00:21:50.767,00:21:53.603,"-Just change your pants, George. -I'm gonna change my pants, Alice."
00:21:53.687,00:21:55.731,"But if I change my pants, I gotta change my jacket."
00:21:55.814,00:21:57.774,"If I change my jacket, I gotta change my shirt."
00:21:57.858,00:21:59.818,"If I change my shirt, I gotta change my tie."
00:21:59.901,00:22:03.196,"I have to change my belt, I've gotta change my shoes, I've gotta change my socks."
00:22:03.280,00:22:05.365,"Just change your pants, George."
00:22:34.311,00:22:37.856,"I don't need you to drool all over me, for God sakes."
00:22:37.939,00:22:41.610,"Come on, you're so smart. What am I telling you about?"
00:22:43.111,00:22:44.696,Listen to me talking.
00:22:58.418,00:22:59.753,"-Bye, honey. -Ooh."
00:23:00.712,00:23:02.714,Sorry. Good luck.
00:23:04.382,00:23:05.884,A little Kleenex or something.
00:23:40.752,00:23:43.046,"Easy, buddy. Save some for the fishes."
00:24:52.908,00:24:56.703,"Look at Tom. He's wide open. Shoot it. Shoot it, man."
00:24:56.786,00:24:58.538,Put it up. Put it up.
00:24:58.622,00:25:01.166,-This guy's all over me. -Shoot it.
00:25:06.880,00:25:09.382,"Lonnie and Logan, give me ten."
00:25:10.508,00:25:12.135,"Let's go, hustle. Hustle."
00:25:15.222,00:25:16.514,"Hi, Mark."
00:25:21.686,00:25:23.104,-You're sweaty. -You like it?
00:25:32.822,00:25:33.949,in all of household hygiene.
00:25:35.033,00:25:39.204,"See, all of these use a two-dip process that guarantees a longer smell life."
00:25:39.287,00:25:40.956,"Here, smell this."
00:25:41.039,00:25:42.958,-That smell nice? Nice smell? -Mmm.
00:25:44.459,00:25:48.380,"See, we feel if we get the right amount of capital, we can take this place right to the top."
00:25:48.463,00:25:51.633,I don't just mean successful. I mean dominant.
00:25:53.051,00:25:55.595,Here's a favorite. Here's a favorite. Look at this.
00:25:58.848,00:26:01.643,-I could use that in my Beemer. -I could use it in my Beemer.
00:26:01.726,00:26:03.937,We feel a lot of people could use them in their Beemers.
00:26:04.020,00:26:08.191,Except I wouldn't want to hang it from my rear-view mirror. Ew. Tacky.
00:26:08.275,00:26:10.360,"Oh, no, no, no. There's Velcro on the back."
00:26:10.443,00:26:14.030,"You know, people hide them. A lot of people just put it under their dashboard."
00:26:14.114,00:26:15.699,-Ingenious. -Thank you.
00:26:15.782,00:26:17.659,"Bravo, Newton. Kudos."
00:26:17.742,00:26:18.994,Thank you.
00:26:28.753,00:26:30.005,Let's get Ted.
00:26:30.213,00:26:31.339,Hey.
00:26:35.010,00:26:39.389,"Hey, Teddy boy. Oh, that's a nice lunch you got there."
00:26:39.472,00:26:42.684,"-A veritable nutrition lesson. -Oh, yeah."
00:26:42.767,00:26:47.605,"And, uh, don't forget to wash it down with a big glass of milk."
00:26:51.818,00:26:53.445,See you on the bus.
00:27:14.549,00:27:17.260,Hi. Miss Simpkins made me stay after.
00:27:23.433,00:27:24.976,Hold on a minute.
00:27:32.817,00:27:34.319,Good boy.
00:27:41.201,00:27:42.494,See over there?
00:27:43.203,00:27:44.871,That's Donna Ditsworth.
00:27:44.954,00:27:47.916,She's the most popular girl in the whole school.
00:27:49.584,00:27:52.837,Her hair is perfect. Her teeth are perfect.
00:27:54.005,00:27:56.424,Even Mark thinks she's perfect.
00:28:02.305,00:28:03.431,Beethoven!
00:28:16.277,00:28:17.779,"Hey, check out Fido."
00:28:20.323,00:28:22.909,-What a cool-looking dog. -I bet you wanna play fetch.
00:28:25.787,00:28:28.289,"Come on, you gotta give me the stick if you want me to throw it."
00:28:29.874,00:28:31.084,"Hey, where we going?"
00:28:38.925,00:28:40.844,-Cool dog. -Cool dog.
00:28:40.927,00:28:42.095,Is he yours?
00:28:43.596,00:28:44.764,What's his name?
00:28:45.557,00:28:46.683,Beethoven.
00:28:46.766,00:28:49.352,"-Wow. Hi, Beethoven. -Hey, Beethoven."
00:28:52.856,00:28:54.941,"Well, see you later, Ryce."
00:29:00.238,00:29:02.615,Yes! He knows my name.
00:29:04.617,00:29:06.202,He knows my name.
00:29:08.872,00:29:10.790,You've built yourself something pretty impressive here.
00:29:10.874,00:29:13.042,"Well, thank you. Thank you very much."
00:29:14.043,00:29:16.212,-That mean you're interested? -Absolutely.
00:29:16.296,00:29:18.131,"We've smelt a lot of stuff, George."
00:29:18.214,00:29:24.179,But I think I speak for myself as well as the Brie Meister when I say yours smells the best.
00:29:26.473,00:29:28.475,"George, we're gonna crunch some numbers."
00:29:28.558,00:29:31.478,"And, uh, maybe we can get together later this week."
00:29:31.561,00:29:32.729,-That would be great. Thank you. -Okay.
00:29:32.812,00:29:34.481,-We're looking forward to it. -I'll get it. I'll get it.
00:29:34.564,00:29:35.440,-Thanks. -Thank you.
00:29:35.523,00:29:36.649,"-Ciao, George. -Ciao."
00:29:38.401,00:29:40.111,"-Ciao, George. -Ciao, bello."
00:29:43.031,00:29:44.199,Ciao!
00:29:45.575,00:29:46.785,Ciao!
00:29:46.868,00:29:47.994,Ciao!
00:30:26.324,00:30:28.243,"How you doing, Theodore?"
00:30:28.660,00:30:30.286,"Nice backpack, Teddy."
00:30:30.703,00:30:31.955,Can I see it?
00:30:34.707,00:30:35.834,-Sorry! -Oh.
00:30:35.917,00:30:38.253,Why do you guys always pick on me?
00:30:38.336,00:30:40.547,'Cause you're a little four-eyed dork.
00:30:43.174,00:30:45.343,They're mine. Give them back!
00:30:46.761,00:30:48.805,"-Hey, where you going, Teddy? -Yeah, let's go."
00:30:59.315,00:31:01.401,"Wait up, Theodore. We wanna walk you home."
00:31:20.169,00:31:22.297,"Oh, come on. Scaredy-cat."
00:31:28.136,00:31:29.470,"Scared? Come on, fight me."
00:31:33.892,00:31:35.351,What's going on here?
00:31:42.483,00:31:45.153,-Give him the glasses. -Sorry. Sorry.
00:31:52.869,00:31:54.579,And don't come back!
00:32:14.599,00:32:16.851,I know it doesn't mean that he likes me...
00:32:18.811,00:32:22.398,but he's gotta like me better than before he said my name.
00:32:24.776,00:32:26.736,"You think he could like me, Beethoven?"
00:32:30.907,00:32:32.742,I know you like me.
00:32:35.119,00:32:35.954,"Good night, sweetheart."
00:32:37.914,00:32:38.915,"You, out!"
00:32:39.874,00:32:41.125,"Good night, Beethoven."
00:32:42.794,00:32:44.587,"-Good night, honey. -Good night, Daddy."
00:32:53.012,00:32:54.180,Mark.
00:32:57.475,00:32:59.560,"All right. You, in here. In here."
00:32:59.644,00:33:02.855,You sleep in here. I sleep there. You...
00:33:04.190,00:33:05.358,Oh.
00:33:07.902,00:33:09.237,That's progress.
00:33:10.154,00:33:12.365,I appreciate that. Good night.
00:33:15.410,00:33:16.494,Good night.
00:33:24.460,00:33:30.675,"ever since you started looking for investors, you just seem-- -Well, hey, you wanted us to expand. -Well, I want you to be happy."
00:33:30.758,00:33:33.302,"Yeah, you even said you'd come back to work."
00:33:34.095,00:33:37.015,I said I'd give you one wish for your birthday.
00:33:37.932,00:33:40.351,"Well, I wish you'd come back to work."
00:33:42.353,00:33:44.022,"George, there's other things that are important."
00:33:44.105,00:33:46.024,I like being home when the kids get home from school.
00:33:46.107,00:33:48.526,I don't want them to come home to some stranger.
00:33:48.609,00:33:50.028,We'll get a great babysitter.
00:33:50.111,00:33:53.072,We'll get somebody really reliable that the kids will just love.
00:34:26.314,00:34:28.566,...in the third occurrence this month.
00:34:28.649,00:34:33.488,In the past year we've seen a 500% increase in the reported incidents of stolen pets.
00:34:33.571,00:34:36.282,Police believe an animal kidnapping ring is at work.
00:34:36.365,00:34:38.493,That's News Break. And now back to The Wolfman.
00:34:39.285,00:34:40.912,-Did you hear something? -No.
00:34:40.995,00:34:42.997,"No, I heard something downstairs."
00:35:52.859,00:35:55.278,You were right. The TV was on.
00:35:56.779,00:35:59.073,I don't know. I hope I'm doing the right thing.
00:35:59.157,00:36:05.621,"I mean, it feels like a good idea to expand, but I don't want to do it at everybody's expense."
00:36:05.705,00:36:08.207,We have to get somebody wonderful to take care of the kids.
00:36:08.291,00:36:10.084,There's no question about that.
00:36:16.591,00:36:22.180,"Boy, no matter how many showers I take, I still smell Beethoven all over me."
00:36:24.265,00:36:26.893,Are you okay? You're so quiet.
00:36:33.691,00:36:35.026,Aw...
00:36:35.568,00:36:36.903,"Oh, baby."
00:36:37.653,00:36:41.073,"Oh, baby, it's not even Saturday night."
00:36:41.282,00:36:43.492,"Oh, Alice, you drive me crazy."
00:36:43.951,00:36:44.785,Oh.
00:36:44.869,00:36:48.039,Has Daddy's little girl been naughty tonight?
00:36:51.542,00:36:52.501,Who are you talking to?
00:37:06.766,00:37:09.644,How dare you? Are you crazy?
00:37:09.727,00:37:12.271,Did you think you were gonna get away with it?
00:37:15.441,00:37:17.526,That's how you do it.
00:37:17.610,00:37:19.570,I'll put a stop to that.
00:37:19.695,00:37:22.114,You've ruined my life.
00:37:22.198,00:37:25.034,You've ruined my furniture. You've ruined my clothes.
00:37:25.117,00:37:27.745,My family likes you more than they like me.
00:37:27.828,00:37:32.250,Why? All you do is drool and shed and eat.
00:37:32.333,00:37:34.919,You're never getting out of there again. Never!
00:37:35.002,00:37:37.255,Do we understand each other?
00:37:37.797,00:37:39.048,Do we...
00:37:44.095,00:37:45.221,Uh...
00:38:03.281,00:38:05.533,"Hey, little buddy. How you doing?"
00:38:06.367,00:38:07.868,Thank you. Good work.
00:38:19.797,00:38:20.923,Vernon.
00:38:21.465,00:38:22.550,"Come on, Harvey."
00:38:24.135,00:38:25.845,-Can I tell you something? -What?
00:38:52.246,00:38:54.248,It explodes on contact.
00:38:55.124,00:38:57.835,We'd like you to use this revolver for the tests.
00:38:58.544,00:39:02.256,We want to know the extent of the damage at close range.
00:39:07.678,00:39:10.348,You want to know how messy it is.
00:39:13.851,00:39:17.521,I presume you can get dogs with big skulls for the tests.
00:39:18.314,00:39:20.691,"Newfoundlands, Great Danes, Saint Bernards."
00:39:20.775,00:39:24.987,"Large dogs are difficult to come by, harder to manage."
00:39:40.503,00:39:43.047,I'm sure we'll be able to handle it.
00:40:12.451,00:40:14.161,-Mr. Newton? -Yes.
00:40:14.245,00:40:18.082,I'm Dr. Varnick. This must be Beethoven.
00:40:18.457,00:40:19.458,Mmm-hmm.
00:40:20.000,00:40:23.963,"Ah, he's a magnificent animal. Magnificent."
00:40:30.845,00:40:33.597,"Well, he'll be a little groggy this evening."
00:40:35.766,00:40:40.312,Perhaps you should leave him overnight for observation.
00:40:40.396,00:40:42.189,-I'd be happy to. -Dad.
00:40:42.314,00:40:44.108,It's just a shot. He'll be okay.
00:40:44.191,00:40:47.862,"Yeah, come on, Dad, let's take him home. He's scared and he wants to go home."
00:40:47.945,00:40:52.491,"Uh, Mr. Newton, I wonder if I might have a word with you privately."
00:40:53.159,00:40:53.993,Sure.
00:40:55.619,00:40:56.954,Good dog.
00:40:59.165,00:41:01.667,"Maggie, take good care of these nice people."
00:41:02.293,00:41:05.546,"Dad, they aren't gonna hurt Beethoven, are they?"
00:41:20.060,00:41:21.520,Please sit down.
00:41:24.148,00:41:25.357,Mr. Newton...
00:41:26.609,00:41:27.902,"have you, uh..."
00:41:29.278,00:41:33.240,Have you noticed anything strange about your dog lately?
00:41:39.038,00:41:41.665,"You know, I mean, he's destroyed my life."
00:41:43.542,00:41:44.835,I wish I was kidding.
00:41:47.379,00:41:49.465,Saint Bernards have been heavily over-bred.
00:41:50.341,00:41:54.887,There's been quite a bit written about certain behavioral problems with the breed.
00:41:55.304,00:41:56.805,What kind of problems?
00:41:57.556,00:42:03.020,"Well, I don't know how to tell you this, but I've had to put down several of these animals over the past six months."
00:42:04.188,00:42:09.026,"They have a tendency to turn on people, attack without provocation."
00:42:09.360,00:42:12.905,"Now, I only mention this because you have children."
00:42:25.042,00:42:28.295,"George, come on. Beethoven isn't even remotely dangerous."
00:42:28.379,00:42:31.423,"He'd never hurt the kids. He might take a bite out of you, though."
00:42:32.883,00:42:36.720,"First... First snarl, first any kind of weirdness and he's gone."
00:42:37.054,00:42:41.433,"Weirdness? What should I watch for, honey, his wearing my clothes around the house?"
00:42:50.025,00:42:52.111,You guys are gonna love Devonia.
00:42:52.194,00:42:54.446,"Mom, I don't need a babysitter."
00:42:54.530,00:42:57.950,"How come you gotta go back to work, anyway?"
00:42:58.033,00:43:01.328,"Come on, there's no point in any of us going into this with a bad attitude."
00:43:01.829,00:43:04.790,"Hi, there, you little cutie."
00:43:06.041,00:43:10.713,"Don't you worry about a thing. We're gonna get along great. Right, kids?"
00:43:11.505,00:43:13.841,"Okay, you guys, I'll be back before dinner, so it's not that long."
00:43:13.924,00:43:15.676,"Oh, we're gonna do a lot of neat stuff."
00:43:15.759,00:43:18.262,I was hoping we could sing a little tune together.
00:43:18.345,00:43:20.556,"You guys like music, huh?"
00:43:21.974,00:43:24.935,"Well, how about Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass?"
00:43:26.604,00:43:29.398,"Now, I am a nut for the disco beat."
00:43:29.690,00:43:30.691,Hmm-mmm.
00:43:30.774,00:43:32.735,"Okay, kids, be good."
00:43:51.003,00:43:54.506,-You've had some time to think and... -And we made our decision.
00:43:58.927,00:44:01.639,We wanna get in bed with Newton Auto Air Fresheners.
00:44:01.972,00:44:04.350,Excellent! That's great. That's just great.
00:44:04.475,00:44:06.810,-Thank you very much. That's great. -As quickly as possible.
00:44:06.894,00:44:09.772,We can meet with our lawyers today and have the papers drawn up this afternoon.
00:44:09.855,00:44:11.357,"Oh, great. That's excellent. Excellent."
00:44:11.440,00:44:13.567,Let us take you out to dinner. Huh?
00:44:15.986,00:44:18.739,"Ah... Restaurants. Uh, what?"
00:44:19.907,00:44:21.825,Why don't you just come over to our house? We can barbecue.
00:44:21.909,00:44:23.702,Come to our house. We'll barbecue.
00:44:27.539,00:44:28.707,Let's live dangerously.
00:44:28.791,00:44:31.794,"Well, our food may not be great, but it's not dangerous."
00:44:33.212,00:44:35.923,I hope it's better than this espresso.
00:45:38.485,00:45:39.486,Help!
00:45:51.582,00:45:53.250,"Help, somebody!"
00:46:55.020,00:46:57.731,"Thanks, Beethoven. You saved my life."
00:46:58.440,00:47:03.153,But you'd better go home now. Mom said to stay in the backyard.
00:47:03.362,00:47:12.579,"You kids might be interested to know that I am a featured performer Oh, my gosh. Emily's in the pool!"
00:47:16.833,00:47:17.668,Emily!
00:47:19.086,00:47:20.879,You're going to get out of there this instant.
00:47:20.963,00:47:22.714,You want to get me into trouble?
00:47:26.260,00:47:28.887,"Oh, Emily, you must've been so scared."
00:47:28.971,00:47:31.139,I thought I was gonna die.
00:47:31.848,00:47:33.767,"Oh, you poor little thing."
00:47:33.850,00:47:37.729,"Now, you were never in any real danger, now, were you?"
00:47:37.813,00:47:42.985,"Now, we don't want you to get into trouble, so we'll let this be our little secret."
00:47:44.528,00:47:46.363,"I'd like to call my mother, please."
00:47:46.822,00:47:47.781,Your mother?
00:47:47.864,00:47:49.116,Immediately.
00:47:52.369,00:47:55.372,She must've snuck out while I was watching Ted and Ryce.
00:47:55.455,00:47:59.334,"It was hot out, so I guess she wanted to take a little swim."
00:48:00.794,00:48:02.504,And where were you while all this was happening?
00:48:02.588,00:48:06.300,"I was where I was supposed to be, inside, watching the other two."
00:48:06.383,00:48:10.178,"If Emily had stayed where I put her, none of this would've happened."
00:48:10.262,00:48:14.308,"If you ask me, what these children need is a little discipline."
00:48:18.020,00:48:18.895,You're fired.
00:48:23.358,00:48:26.820,You can't throw out the option of having a babysitter just because we had a bad one.
00:48:26.903,00:48:29.948,We'll find somebody really responsible to look after the kids.
00:48:37.497,00:48:41.627,"You know, we're fine on our own. You don't have to entertain us."
00:48:49.092,00:48:50.344,Do you have any kids?
00:48:55.724,00:48:57.100,We have a career.
00:48:59.186,00:49:00.562,Excuse us.
00:49:07.569,00:49:09.404,-Brats. -Monsters.
00:49:10.072,00:49:15.911,"If we pull this off, in six months we will own Newton Auto Air Fresheners."
00:49:20.832,00:49:21.958,Mmm.
00:49:22.542,00:49:23.960,Sorry for the delay.
00:49:25.962,00:49:28.131,"-Vegetables. Here you go. -Oh, look at that."
00:49:29.049,00:49:33.178,"-Here's the paperwork, Georgio. -I've got my own chair, honey."
00:49:39.935,00:49:41.687,"-Look at that. -You gonna do that now, honey?"
00:49:42.813,00:49:44.106,Alicia.
00:49:44.481,00:49:45.982,-Alice. -It's Alice.
00:49:46.066,00:49:48.985,"I'm sorry. Alice. Could I have a refill, please?"
00:49:52.155,00:49:53.240,Thank you.
00:49:57.828,00:50:00.914,"Just right down at the bottom there, George."
00:50:10.340,00:50:11.425,"Hon, don't sign that now."
00:50:11.508,00:50:16.096,"Why don't we have a little something to eat and then -you can read it over and-- -Alice, tell me about your dog."
00:50:16.304,00:50:17.764,"Oh, gee, no."
00:50:19.182,00:50:20.434,Oh. He sure is.
00:50:20.976,00:50:23.311,"Hello, cutesy-ootsy."
00:50:23.395,00:50:27.023,"-He's a Saint Bernard. -He's a purebred Saint Bernard, isn't he?"
00:50:27.107,00:50:27.941,"-Oh, yes. -Hello."
00:50:32.779,00:50:35.115,"Look at that. Come here. Oh, yeah."
00:50:35.198,00:50:38.869,"You wanna come with Mommy and Daddy? Yes, you do, don't you?"
00:50:38.952,00:50:41.329,"Oh, come on. Come on. We'll come to Mommy and Daddy."
00:50:41.413,00:50:43.039,Come on. Come on.
00:50:47.919,00:50:50.797,"Dogs obey so much better than children, don't they?"
00:50:52.090,00:50:55.635,"Oh, hello, cutesy-ootsy-oogy."
00:50:55.719,00:51:00.348,"Oh, Mummy just loves this great big doggie-woggie. Yes!"
00:51:01.933,00:51:06.813,"Georgio, the places for you to sign, yeah, are marked by that blue clip right there."
00:51:09.149,00:51:12.027,"Honey, you sure you wanna signee-wignee right now?"
00:51:12.110,00:51:14.529,"-I mean, maybe we can-- -Oh."
00:51:14.613,00:51:15.989,"Alice, I'm sorry."
00:51:16.072,00:51:19.242,I've got that. You be careful. I don't want you to break a nail.
00:51:20.702,00:51:24.956,"Right down there, where the blue arrow is. Right there, George."
00:51:25.040,00:51:27.292,"Honey, you sit. I've got this."
00:51:30.879,00:51:33.131,You guys don't seem to have made a good impression.
00:51:33.215,00:51:34.758,-I'm crushed. -Me too.
00:51:34.841,00:51:36.301,I'll cry all night.
00:51:36.384,00:51:37.761,"I know. I know. I don't like them, either."
00:51:37.844,00:51:40.096,But these people are real important to Dad's business.
00:51:40.180,00:51:43.683,I hope Beethoven slimes that lady's dress.
00:51:45.769,00:51:48.396,we could find another investment somewhere else.
00:51:48.480,00:51:50.941,"-Sure. -No, no, no. I'm..."
00:51:53.193,00:51:55.612,"Beethoven, come on. Down, down."
00:51:55.695,00:51:57.239,"Georgio, is there some problem?"
00:51:57.322,00:51:59.241,"-No, no. -Did I miss anything?"
00:51:59.324,00:52:08.041,"No, no. Georgio has just gone over all the papers Just standard stuff, really. It's just the..."
00:52:08.750,00:52:10.710,"Hey, get out of here, you mutt."
00:52:14.923,00:52:16.883,I pitched in college.
00:52:38.113,00:52:38.947,Bad dog!
00:52:40.156,00:52:42.534,Sit! Stop! Stay!
00:52:42.617,00:52:44.286,"Oh, no!"
00:53:25.076,00:53:27.245,I really don't like our dog.
00:53:33.293,00:53:34.127,I don't trust them.
00:53:35.128,00:53:36.713,I don't want their money.
00:53:39.925,00:53:44.429,"I know my opinion doesn't matter, but I'm not interested in expanding."
00:53:45.764,00:53:49.643,"If I had been home instead of helping you impress those morons, Emily wouldn't have fallen in the pool."
00:53:51.061,00:53:53.855,"And I'm not re-entering the workforce, George."
00:53:53.939,00:53:55.649,You're gonna have to do this on your own.
00:53:58.360,00:54:01.529,And you will. Somehow you'll make your fortune.
00:54:02.530,00:54:05.867,"And tucked away behind you, deep in the shadows, will be me and the kids."
00:54:12.958,00:54:16.795,That's how you see me. Suddenly I'm a-- I'm a lousy husband and father.
00:54:17.545,00:54:21.257,"You know, everything was just fine until Beethoven came into our lives."
00:54:23.802,00:54:27.305,"I've tried to be patient, but I've had it."
00:54:27.973,00:54:29.516,The dog has to go.
00:54:32.102,00:54:34.646,"Those two idiots insulted your kids, they treated me like dirt."
00:54:34.729,00:54:38.274,And he was the only one of us who had the nerve to give them the ride they deserved.
00:54:41.319,00:54:42.153,I'm going to bed.
00:54:44.572,00:54:47.784,My dream's going down the drain and you're worried about a dog.
00:54:50.954,00:54:53.790,Your family's going down the drain and you're worried about a dream.
00:56:28.426,00:56:31.137,"-Sit down. -We made you breakfast, Dad."
00:56:31.221,00:56:33.014,"Scrambled eggs, just the way you like them."
00:56:33.098,00:56:34.224,I fed Beethoven.
00:56:38.603,00:56:40.271,You should smell him.
00:56:40.438,00:56:42.565,I'm gonna walk Beethoven every day.
00:56:42.649,00:56:47.570,We've divided up the dog chores so that you won't have to do anything for Beethoven from now on.
00:56:48.071,00:56:49.280,I see.
00:56:49.572,00:56:53.118,Is there anything else you need? Anything else at all?
00:56:53.952,00:56:55.578,"No, thank you. I'm fine."
00:57:00.959,00:57:03.628,I dropped part of an eggshell in there.
00:57:05.046,00:57:06.756,"Chew carefully, Dad."
00:57:13.346,00:57:15.306,I'm gonna get that thing right there. Okay?
00:57:15.390,00:57:17.183,"-Okay, that leaf's mine. -I get the next one."
00:57:22.313,00:57:23.398,Shake.
00:57:28.903,00:57:29.946,Ah.
00:57:30.029,00:57:31.531,"Ah, Mrs. Newton."
00:57:31.656,00:57:34.117,"-Yes. -I'm Dr. Varnick, the veterinarian."
00:57:34.200,00:57:37.370,"I, uh... I'm sorry to trouble you, but I..."
00:57:38.121,00:57:39.747,I wonder if I might come in.
00:57:42.375,00:57:43.793,"Well, sure. Yeah, come on in."
00:57:44.502,00:57:47.922,"With animals as large as yours, I like to do a follow-up on rabies shots..."
00:57:48.006,00:57:49.716,"-Oh, well... -...just to see how he's doing."
00:57:49.799,00:57:52.093,"I tell you, it's really nice of you to come all the way down here."
00:57:52.177,00:57:53.261,No trouble at all. No trouble at all.
00:57:53.386,00:57:56.389,-Here you go. -Thank you. I'll only be a moment.
00:57:56.473,00:57:59.726,"-Would you like a lemonade or anything? -Oh, no. No, no. I'll be fine. Thank you."
00:57:59.809,00:58:01.019,All right.
00:58:01.478,00:58:04.939,"Now, Beethoven, how are you doing, huh?"
00:58:08.526,00:58:10.111,Looking good. Looking good.
00:58:18.536,00:58:23.333,"Beethoven, this is gonna hurt you a lot more than it hurts me."
00:58:23.917,00:58:27.003,But it's a great benefit to mankind.
00:58:28.630,00:58:29.797,Put some of this here.
00:58:46.648,00:58:48.191,All right now.
00:58:48.983,00:58:50.235,Ah...
00:58:53.488,00:58:56.616,"-No! -Emily, what's the matter?"
00:59:06.376,00:59:07.669,Help! Help!
00:59:08.086,00:59:10.755,"George! Oh, my God."
00:59:14.050,00:59:15.760,Good boy. Good boy.
00:59:16.261,00:59:19.097,Beethoven! Beethoven!
00:59:21.307,00:59:22.725,Beethoven!
00:59:23.977,00:59:26.604,"-Beethoven. Oh, my gosh, Beethoven! -Stay there."
00:59:29.899,00:59:31.442,"Oh, my gosh, look what he did."
00:59:31.526,00:59:34.362,"-Are you all right? -Well, I don't know."
00:59:34.445,00:59:36.155,-What happened? -So sorry.
00:59:36.239,00:59:37.365,He just lunged at me.
00:59:37.657,00:59:40.577,That's not true. I saw you. You hit Beethoven!
00:59:40.660,00:59:41.911,"Emily, please."
00:59:42.161,00:59:45.248,Why would I hit Beethoven? I patted him on the head.
00:59:45.999,00:59:49.544,It's possible that from a distance the little child-- Liar!
00:59:49.627,00:59:51.421,"-Emily! Emily! -No, it's all-- Oh!"
00:59:51.504,00:59:52.922,I'm sorry. Everything's all right.
00:59:53.006,00:59:56.593,It's very natural that the child would want to defend her dog.
00:59:56.676,00:59:59.387,"-Let's call an ambulance. -No, no, no. I'll take care of it."
00:59:59.470,01:00:01.764,I'll take care of this myself.
01:00:05.810,01:00:09.814,"I'm terribly sorry. I mean, he's never done anything like this before."
01:00:09.897,01:00:16.696,"Once an animal crosses the line and attacks a human being, you can rest assured he'll do it again."
01:00:17.196,01:00:19.616,"Of course, next time it could be one of your children."
01:00:24.621,01:00:27.081,"Mr. Newton, we have a real problem here."
01:00:27.415,01:00:30.668,The law is very clear when it comes to dealing with this kind of thing.
01:00:30.752,01:00:36.466,"Unless you bring the animal to my office immediately, I'm afraid I'll... I'll be forced to press charges."
01:00:38.885,01:00:39.886,Mmm.
01:01:03.701,01:01:06.621,Dad won't believe me 'cause he hates Beethoven.
01:01:06.704,01:01:09.082,He's always hated Beethoven.
01:02:04.053,01:02:05.471,Dad has Beethoven.
01:02:13.855,01:02:14.939,Stop!
01:02:16.107,01:02:17.191,Daddy!
01:02:20.987,01:02:21.821,Wait!
01:02:22.864,01:02:24.115,Wait!
01:02:48.514,01:02:52.185,My dad had to take our dog to the vet to be put down.
01:02:54.270,01:02:55.396,I hated him for it.
01:02:56.939,01:02:58.733,Now I'm doing it myself.
01:03:03.112,01:03:06.783,"I know you won't believe me, but I don't wanna do this."
01:03:11.871,01:03:13.206,You understand.
01:03:15.291,01:03:16.793,It's not your fault.
01:03:42.610,01:03:44.737,-Mr. Newton. -Dr. Varnick.
01:03:45.071,01:03:46.364,"I, uh..."
01:03:46.906,01:03:49.116,I know that you're doing the right thing.
01:03:51.077,01:03:53.412,-I hope so. -Follow me.
01:04:01.212,01:04:04.423,"-How's your arm? -Oh, it's fine. Fine."
01:04:04.924,01:04:08.094,-Thirty-seven stitches. -I'm so sorry.
01:04:08.886,01:04:11.264,Do you want the collar and tags?
01:04:11.347,01:04:12.974,Some people like to keep them.
01:04:15.142,01:04:16.102,Yeah.
01:04:16.185,01:04:19.146,Do you mind? I have the bad wing.
01:04:21.107,01:04:23.693,Come here. Come here. Come here.
01:04:42.003,01:04:43.254,I'm sorry.
01:05:00.187,01:05:02.023,Sad state of affairs.
01:05:02.106,01:05:05.192,"Sad state of affairs. Come on, boy. Come on."
01:05:06.903,01:05:08.613,"Come on, boy. Come on."
01:05:09.947,01:05:12.366,In you go. There you go.
01:05:13.826,01:05:16.454,All right. Magnificent.
01:05:32.303,01:05:33.596,George Newton.
01:05:34.305,01:05:43.689,"Yeah, look, we're gonna have to charge you for a day's boarding because Jimmy, who handles the lethal injections and disposals, he doesn't work today, so we're gonna have to hold the dog overnight."
01:05:44.565,01:05:45.858,"So, should we bill you?"
01:06:46.627,01:06:49.088,Get everything ready. I'll be by in the morning.
01:06:49.171,01:06:51.048,We'll do the test on him first thing.
01:06:51.549,01:06:52.550,All right.
01:07:04.311,01:07:06.105,I've got him. Come on!
01:07:11.235,01:07:13.112,"-Okay, I got him. -Good, good."
01:07:13.195,01:07:14.280,-I got him. -Pull him in.
01:07:14.363,01:07:18.409,"-Come on, doggie. -Not you! Not you, the dog! Not you!"
01:07:21.037,01:07:22.955,In the cage. Get in.
01:07:36.552,01:07:37.636,There.
01:07:38.679,01:07:40.598,Doc will work on him first thing in the morning...
01:07:43.392,01:07:44.810,Can we eat?
01:07:45.561,01:07:47.438,"-Yeah. You hungry? -Yeah, I'm hungry."
01:08:02.828,01:08:04.955,Did I do the wrong thing?
01:08:07.124,01:08:08.709,"I don't know, honey."
01:08:13.089,01:08:15.257,Beethoven made this house real.
01:08:19.178,01:08:20.805,He put the dents in it.
01:08:24.225,01:08:27.561,"I know he slobbered and he smelled bad, but he loved us."
01:08:30.981,01:08:31.816,Even you.
01:08:38.364,01:08:42.535,"I just hope your motives were pure, and you did this just for the safety of the kids."
01:08:42.618,01:08:48.374,Because I really hate to think that we sold Beethoven down the river for a piece of carpet or a chance to sell more air freshener.
01:08:48.457,01:08:50.960,"Oh, come on. It had nothing to do with carpet or air freshener."
01:08:51.043,01:08:52.670,You saw what he did to the vet.
01:08:52.753,01:08:53.963,-I know. -Don't even say that.
01:08:54.046,01:08:55.714,"Yes, but we don't know why he did it."
01:08:55.798,01:08:59.635,"Maybe the vet didn't hit him, but maybe he handled him too rough or something."
01:09:02.138,01:09:05.391,Have we ever known her to attack an adult and accuse them of lying?
01:09:05.474,01:09:08.394,"No, but why would a vet say something like that?"
01:09:08.477,01:09:13.816,"Well, instead of listening to some guy we've met only twice in our lives, maybe we should try listening to our own child."
01:09:15.442,01:09:16.986,"Honey, please, something doesn't make sense."
01:09:17.069,01:09:19.321,Can't we just go down there and talk to him?
01:09:21.907,01:09:23.075,What do you want me to do?
01:09:23.159,01:09:26.495,"Uh, Dr. Varnick, are you sure you didn't hit our dog?"
01:09:26.579,01:09:29.498,"Oh, yes, Mr. Newton, I just remembered, I did hit your dog."
01:09:29.582,01:09:31.125,"-Come on. -You come on, George."
01:09:31.208,01:09:33.043,"Please, it would make me feel better. Let's just go."
01:09:34.795,01:09:37.339,-I'm coming with you. -So am I.
01:09:37.423,01:09:39.258,We're all going with you.
01:09:55.816,01:09:56.901,I'm terribly sorry.
01:09:56.984,01:09:58.819,-We want our dog back! -Where's Beethoven?
01:09:58.903,01:10:01.572,"-All right, kids, let Daddy handle this. -Mr. Newton, what can I do for you?"
01:10:01.655,01:10:04.742,"-We want our dog back! -Oh, I'm terribly sorry."
01:10:04.825,01:10:06.368,It's too late.
01:10:06.994,01:10:08.412,The dog's been destroyed.
01:10:08.495,01:10:09.705,-No! -Dad!
01:10:09.788,01:10:11.415,"Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute."
01:10:11.498,01:10:13.584,I was told this wouldn't happen until tomorrow.
01:10:13.667,01:10:14.585,I don't believe you.
01:10:14.919,01:10:17.296,"-Come on. -Hey, hey, hey, hey!"
01:10:17.379,01:10:27.014,Take your hands off her. What are you-- I told you he was lying.
01:10:27.806,01:10:29.558,What the hell are you trying to pull?
01:10:31.018,01:10:33.520,"Wait, you can't come in here. This is private property."
01:10:33.604,01:10:35.022,Beethoven?
01:10:39.360,01:10:40.694,"-He's not here. -All right, hold it right there."
01:10:40.778,01:10:41.779,Nobody's here!
01:10:41.862,01:10:44.365,"You have no right to be in here. Out, all of you."
01:10:44.490,01:10:45.699,Where's my dog?
01:10:46.992,01:10:48.452,I don't have to answer your questions.
01:10:48.535,01:10:51.789,"You ordered that dog destroyed, and it was done. Now get out."
01:10:54.625,01:10:57.378,"You hit me, I'll have you put in jail for assault and battery."
01:11:08.222,01:11:09.765,-Whoa! -Dad!
01:11:09.848,01:11:12.017,-Honey. -That was amazing.
01:11:14.520,01:11:16.105,You were really cool.
01:11:16.188,01:11:18.399,"Really, honey, -I never found you more attractive. -Thanks."
01:11:20.067,01:11:21.485,I may need an X-ray.
01:11:21.902,01:11:24.029,He said our dog bit him on the arm.
01:11:24.113,01:11:25.114,But he didn't really bite him. Tell him that.
01:11:26.323,01:11:28.659,But there were no bite marks on his arm!
01:11:29.159,01:11:31.996,"So what? What do you mean, So what?"
01:11:33.664,01:11:36.208,"You know, I'd like to file a report on you!"
01:11:37.710,01:11:40.087,"-What, they're not going to help us? -Not this year."
01:11:40.170,01:11:42.423,"-Shh, Dad, Dr. Varnick. -Look."
01:12:03.068,01:12:04.653,Hold your door. Hold your door.
01:12:07.364,01:12:08.407,Shut it.
01:12:17.875,01:12:19.251,Turn off your lights.
01:12:41.565,01:12:42.691,I think that's the last of it.
01:12:42.775,01:12:44.568,"All right, good. Better start getting the dogs."
01:12:44.651,01:12:45.486,The dogs?
01:12:46.570,01:12:49.156,Yeah. He said we gotta destroy all the evidence.
01:13:44.711,01:13:48.966,"It's 9:30. If I'm not back in 15 minutes, call the police."
01:13:51.343,01:13:53.011,Don't come in after me.
01:13:59.601,01:14:04.314,"Before you destroy the dogs, bring me the Saint Bernard for the ammo test."
01:14:06.942,01:14:09.987,And bring me a little one for this chemical test.
01:14:10.070,01:14:12.656,Sure. I know just the one.
01:14:13.073,01:14:14.199,Hurry up.
01:14:39.725,01:14:43.145,Congratulations. You're gonna be a pioneer.
01:14:43.228,01:14:45.147,"-Like Davy Crockett, right? -Right."
01:15:15.511,01:15:17.888,"Oh, no! Oh, no! No, no!"
01:15:36.907,01:15:39.368,I'm saving you! I'm saving you!
01:16:01.056,01:16:03.642,"Emily, come on. Here, Ryce, take her."
01:16:03.725,01:16:08.939,"Lock the doors. If I'm not back in 15-- I'll be back, all right?"
01:16:09.022,01:16:11.483,"Lock the doors, you guys. Lock that one and that one."
01:16:22.035,01:16:24.746,We're gonna have a little field test with this new ammo.
01:16:39.886,01:16:42.806,"You're a very foolish man, Mr. Newton."
01:16:44.016,01:16:46.059,You should've left well enough alone.
01:16:52.899,01:16:55.068,-That was a gun! -Daddy!
01:16:55.152,01:16:56.653,"Mom, get over here!"
01:16:56.737,01:16:57.946,There's no time!
01:17:04.411,01:17:07.080,"I don't know where. It's a big thing, a warehouse!"
01:17:14.212,01:17:22.512,I don't know. It's a-- Ted! Ted!
01:17:45.702,01:17:47.371,-Cool. -Dad!
01:17:47.913,01:17:48.914,Oh.
01:17:48.997,01:17:51.083,Dad! Dad!
01:17:51.166,01:17:54.169,My babies! Are you all right? Are you all right? Oh!
01:17:54.503,01:17:56.505,-Beethoven! -Beethoven!
01:18:02.427,01:18:04.596,"George! Oh, my God!"
01:18:10.686,01:18:12.562,"I was shopping, George! I called the police!"
01:18:12.646,01:18:15.148,I jumped through that thing! I fell on the guys! I knocked the guys!
01:18:15.232,01:18:16.316,What? You're kidding?
01:18:16.400,01:18:19.569,-You let Ted drive! -I didn't let him! Don't yell at me!
01:18:19.653,01:18:20.946,I'm not yelling! Ah...
01:18:44.428,01:18:45.554,"Go, go."
01:18:46.054,01:18:47.139,"Sick 'em, boys."
01:19:12.289,01:19:14.332,Help! Get out of my way!
01:19:37.773,01:19:40.275,"Come on, Harvey. Come on. Over the fence."
01:19:55.999,01:19:58.877,"You thought you could get me, you feeble-minded mongrels!"
01:20:00.462,01:20:03.048,Never! You'll never get me!
01:20:07.052,01:20:09.721,"-Never! -Stupid, stupid doggies."
01:20:09.805,01:20:11.807,"Stupid, stupid doggies!"
01:20:14.059,01:20:15.519,"Stupid, stupid..."
01:20:17.646,01:20:19.481,"And you, and you, you little one!"
01:20:19.940,01:20:23.276,Never! Never! You little mangy...
01:20:23.985,01:20:24.820,What?
01:20:45.340,01:20:51.763,The final chapter of a horror story for animal lovers concluded at County Courthouse today. Ruth Walters has the details.
01:20:51.972,01:20:54.015,"-Animal lovers everywhere cheered today... -Hey, it's us!"
01:20:54.099,01:20:59.271,...when Dr. Herman Varnick and two associates were indicted on 123 counts of animal abuse.
01:21:00.772,01:21:03.692,These were scientific investigations!
01:21:11.616,01:21:15.036,"You know, I had no choice but to do what I did, you know."
01:21:15.120,01:21:18.957,Beethoven is not just some dog that wandered in off the street.
01:21:19.040,01:21:22.544,He's a member of our family and we love him very much.
01:21:27.132,01:21:28.383,Uh...
01:21:34.264,01:21:35.432,Thank you.
01:21:38.435,01:21:40.937,This is Ruth Walters reporting from County Courthouse.
01:21:51.114,01:21:53.074,"-You look beautiful. -Good night, Daddy, you're the best."
01:21:54.576,01:21:56.620,"-Good night, Dad. I love you. -Good night, sweetheart."

01:22:17.307,01:22:18.308,Ryce.
01:22:19.434,01:22:21.227,-Don't stay on too long. -Okay.
01:22:22.103,01:22:23.688,"Dad, who is it?"
01:22:24.230,01:22:27.651,"Uh, somebody who saw you on TV. Mark something."
01:22:31.947,01:22:33.031,Hello?
01:22:34.366,01:22:35.450,Yeah.
01:22:39.329,01:22:40.372,Really?
01:22:41.039,01:22:42.123,Friday?
01:22:50.048,01:22:51.383,Sleep tight.
01:22:55.345,01:22:57.013,"Good night, Beethoven."
