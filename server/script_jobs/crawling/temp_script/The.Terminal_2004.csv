00:05:22.530,00:05:28.162,It seems that your country has suspended all traveling privileges on passports that have been issued by your government.
00:05:28.162,00:05:33.583,And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the United States.
00:05:33.583,00:05:36.711,"That's it in a nutshell, basically, right?"
00:05:36.711,00:05:41.549,"Anyway, it seems that while you were in the air, there was a military coup in your country."
00:05:41.549,00:05:44.219,"Now, most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard."
00:05:44.219,00:05:45.428,They were attacked in the middle of the night.
00:05:45.428,00:05:46.805,There was a terrible firefight.
00:05:46.805,00:05:49.183,"Uh, they got it all on GHN, I think."
00:05:49.183,00:05:51.977,"Anyway, there were very few civilian casualties."
00:05:51.977,00:05:57.024,"Mr. Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside."
00:05:57.024,00:05:59.567,The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
00:05:59.567,00:06:02.737,Krakozhia! Krakozhia.
00:06:04.198,00:06:06.449,Krakozhia. Hmm.
00:06:06.449,00:06:09.911,"I don't think, uh..."
00:06:09.911,00:06:13.248,"Uh, let me..."
00:06:13.248,00:06:16.543,"Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia, okay?"
00:06:16.543,00:06:18.295,Krakozhia.
00:06:18.295,00:06:19.713,Krakozhia.
00:06:19.713,00:06:21.340,Krakozhia.
00:06:21.340,00:06:23.217,Okay.
00:06:23.217,00:06:26.220,"So the potato chips are Krakozhia, okay?"
00:06:26.220,00:06:27.512,And this apple...
00:06:27.512,00:06:30.182,Big Apple.
00:06:30.182,00:06:33.060,...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
00:06:33.060,00:06:34.602,Okay?
00:06:36.855,00:06:39.191,No more Krakozhia.
00:06:39.191,00:06:41.068,New government.
00:06:41.068,00:06:43.153,Revolution.
00:06:44.738,00:06:48.283,So all the flights in and out of your country have been suspended indefinitely.
00:06:48.283,00:06:51.870,"And the new government has sealed all the borders, which means that your passport and visa are no longer valid."
00:06:51.870,00:06:55.874,"So, currently, you are a citizen of nowhere."
00:06:55.874,00:07:04.007,"Now, even if we could get you new papers, we couldn't process 'em until the United States recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification."
00:07:04.007,00:07:11.514,"See, you don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole or non-immigration work travel or diplomatic visas."
00:07:11.514,00:07:13.850,You don't qualify for any of these things.
00:07:13.850,00:07:16.686,You are at this time simply...
00:07:18.355,00:07:19.940,...unacceptable.
00:07:19.940,00:07:21.900,Unacceptable.
00:07:21.900,00:07:24.361,Unacceptable.
00:07:24.361,00:07:30.992,"Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State, Broadway show Cats."
00:07:30.992,00:07:34.829,"Well, I got more bad news for you, Mr. Navorski."
00:07:34.829,00:07:36.497,Okay. Okay.
00:07:36.497,00:07:39.376,Now I go New York City.
00:07:39.376,00:07:41.128,"No, Mr. Navorski, look."
00:07:41.128,00:07:43.797,I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
00:07:43.797,00:07:45.757,Uh...
00:07:45.757,00:07:47.717,We can't allow you to go home either.
00:07:47.717,00:07:49.510,"And the thing is, you don't really have a home."
00:07:49.510,00:07:51.554,Yes.
00:07:51.554,00:07:53.765,"I mean, it's like..."
00:07:53.765,00:07:55.392,"Do you ever see that show, huh?"
00:07:55.392,00:07:57.518,Do you get that show over there? Uh...
00:07:57.518,00:08:00.397,"Talking Tina, Nightmare at 30,000 Feet, Zanti Misfits."
00:08:00.397,00:08:02.983,"Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir."
00:08:02.983,00:08:04.859,"Oh, really?"
00:08:04.859,00:08:07.112,Anyway...
00:08:08.738,00:08:11.241,"Okay, Mr. Navorski, come here. Walk with me."
00:08:11.241,00:08:13.868,"Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski."
00:08:13.868,00:08:17.831,"You have no legal right to enter the United States, and I have no legal right to detain you."
00:08:17.831,00:08:20.000,It seems that you have fallen through a small crack in the system.
00:08:20.000,00:08:21.793,I am crack.
00:08:21.793,00:08:28.633,"Yes. So, until we get this sorted out, I have no choice but to allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge, all right?"
00:08:28.633,00:08:32.095,"So, I am going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man."
00:08:32.095,00:08:33.721,Free?

00:18:49.963,00:18:51.714,You've earned her.
00:18:51.714,00:18:53.424,"Thank you, Frank."
00:18:53.424,00:18:56.135,You have.
00:18:56.135,00:18:59.305,"Oh, come on."
00:18:59.305,00:19:03.017,"Frank, I'm nominating you to take my place."
00:19:03.017,00:19:08.982,"Starting today, you will assume the duties of acting Field Commissioner until you get approval from Washington."
00:19:08.982,00:19:10.524,Really?
00:19:10.524,00:19:12.485,I don't know what to say.
00:19:12.485,00:19:14.487,Jesus.
00:19:14.487,00:19:16.405,"Oh, it's real, Frank."
00:19:16.405,00:19:19.283,Don't you stand there pretending to be surprised.
00:19:19.283,00:19:21.410,Oh.
00:19:21.410,00:19:24.664,You've been waiting for me to retire or drop dead for years now.
00:19:24.664,00:19:26.373,"No, I haven't been waiting for you to retire."
00:19:29.376,00:19:31.337,"That's all right, Frank."
00:19:31.337,00:19:33.339,My retirement will become official the day you get sworn in.
00:19:33.339,00:19:34.757,Uh-huh.
00:19:37.635,00:19:39.553,"You've waited a long time for this, Frank."
00:19:39.553,00:19:42.098,I have.
00:19:42.098,00:19:45.643,Just be careful about the inspection process.
00:19:45.643,00:19:48.688,"I will. I've been here for 17 years, so..."
00:19:48.688,00:19:52.358,"Frank, we're talking about the Field Commissioner position."
00:19:52.358,00:19:56.570,"People are going to look to you for leadership, to set an example."
00:19:58.531,00:20:00.158,"Well, what are you saying?"
00:20:03.161,00:20:06.497,I'm saying the job is yours to lose.
00:20:06.497,00:20:11.627,"DIXON: Ship the Colombians off to asylum hearings, run priors and backgrounds on the Chinese before deporting."
00:20:11.627,00:20:13.921,And call the parents of those kids from Long Island.
00:20:13.921,00:20:16.841,Tell them it was a bad idea to let them go to Jamaica.
00:20:16.841,00:20:18.384,"Come on, everybody, let's go."
00:20:18.384,00:20:20.260,We got South America and Madrid on the tarmac.
00:20:20.260,00:20:22.471,"I want them out of here in half an hour, come on."
00:20:26.809,00:20:29.603,Mr. Thurman.
00:20:29.603,00:20:34.067,There's a man walking around the terminal in a bathrobe.
00:20:34.067,00:20:37.820,"I know, sir."
00:20:58.925,00:21:00.843,TORRES: Next.
00:21:04.638,00:21:06.182,I need visa.
00:21:06.182,00:21:07.808,Where's your green form?
00:21:07.808,00:21:09.852,I can't do anything without your green entry form.
00:21:09.852,00:21:11.729,Go to the wall.
00:21:11.729,00:21:13.940,Next!
00:21:15.482,00:21:17.235,Sir.
00:21:21.072,00:21:23.699,The light green form.
00:21:49.850,00:21:51.518,Light green.
00:21:54.605,00:21:56.274,Mr. Navorski...
00:21:56.274,00:21:58.358,You cannot get into New York without a visa.
00:21:58.358,00:22:02.947,"You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country."
00:22:02.947,00:22:04.573,There's nothing we can do for you here.
00:22:06.033,00:22:08.035,I give you light green.
00:22:08.035,00:22:11.371,"I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day."
00:22:11.371,00:22:14.500,"At this time, you are simply..."
00:22:14.500,00:22:15.835,Unacceptable.
00:22:15.835,00:22:17.295,Yes.
00:22:17.295,00:22:18.879,VIKTOR: Unacceptable.
00:22:20.840,00:22:22.675,DIXON: Why is he still here?
00:22:22.675,00:22:25.178,"You released him, sir."
00:22:26.846,00:22:28.306,Why the hell doesn't he walk out the doors?
00:22:28.306,00:22:31.100,Why doesn't he try to escape?
00:22:31.100,00:22:34.061,"THURMAN: Sir, you told him to wait."
00:22:34.061,00:22:36.272,I didn't think he'd actually do it.
00:22:38.691,00:22:40.693,"I mean, he's in a crack."
00:22:40.693,00:22:42.611,Who the hell waits in a crack?
00:22:42.611,00:22:47.116,"THURMAN: Well, there's no news from the State Department, but I think we can deport him in a few days."
00:22:47.116,00:22:50.953,"Yeah, it could be a few days."
00:22:50.953,00:22:54.999,"Who knows what this guy is thinking, what gulag he escaped from."
00:22:58.836,00:23:01.421,Everything he does comes back to me.
00:23:01.421,00:23:03.007,You wanna bring him back in the holding cell?
00:23:03.007,00:23:05.592,"No, I'll show him the door."
00:23:07.178,00:23:08.846,Hello.
00:23:09.889,00:23:11.349,Hello.
00:23:12.683,00:23:14.476,Do you have an appointment?
00:23:14.476,00:23:16.687,Yes. 9:30.

00:23:19.815,00:23:22.902,Tuesday.
00:23:22.902,00:23:24.778,Excuse me.
00:23:51.513,00:23:55.601,"Airports are tricky places, Mr. Navorski."
00:23:55.601,00:23:58.312,I'm about to tell you something.
00:23:58.312,00:24:01.023,Something that you can never repeat to anyone.
00:24:01.023,00:24:03.441,Do you understand?
00:24:03.441,00:24:04.944,Secret?
00:24:04.944,00:24:06.404,"Yes, a secret."
00:24:06.404,00:24:15.913,"At 12:00 today, the guards at those doors are going to leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late."
00:24:15.913,00:24:18.291,Late...
00:24:18.291,00:24:21.127,Yes.
00:24:21.127,00:24:23.170,Just today.
00:24:23.170,00:24:25.631,No one is going to be watching those doors.
00:24:25.631,00:24:27.674,And no one is going to be watching you.
00:24:27.674,00:24:29.802,"So, America not closed."
00:24:29.802,00:24:31.553,No.
00:24:31.553,00:24:35.724,"America, for five minutes, is open."
00:24:35.724,00:24:37.643,"Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski."
00:24:37.643,00:24:40.813,"United Airlines, final boarding call..."
00:24:48.028,00:24:49.780,"Catch and release, Judge."
00:24:49.780,00:24:51.324,Sometimes you land a small fish.
00:24:51.324,00:24:58.080,"You unhook him very carefully, you place him back in the water, you set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him."
00:24:58.080,00:24:59.665,All right.
00:25:02.335,00:25:04.711,"All right, here we go."
00:25:04.711,00:25:07.173,Okay. Call them off.
00:25:07.173,00:25:09.800,"Johnson, clear the doors."
00:25:12.761,00:25:14.388,All right.
00:25:14.388,00:25:17.850,Get out of there.
00:25:17.850,00:25:19.893,All right.

00:25:24.357,00:25:25.607,Are you sure?
00:25:25.607,00:25:27.776,There he is.
00:25:27.776,00:25:31.364,"All right, Viktor."
00:25:48.797,00:25:52.885,What's so complicated?
00:25:52.885,00:25:56.013,"Come on. In a couple of minutes, you're gonna be somebody else's problem."
00:25:56.013,00:25:58.349,He wants to make sure that nobody's watching.
00:25:58.349,00:26:00.976,I told him nobody would be watching.
00:26:00.976,00:26:03.187,Come on.
00:26:03.187,00:26:04.522,Come on.
00:26:04.522,00:26:05.939,Call the Airport Police.
00:26:05.939,00:26:07.400,Call the authorities.
00:26:08.317,00:26:10.194,Excuse me.
00:26:30.297,00:26:31.924,You got it.
00:26:31.924,00:26:33.591,BOTH: Ah!
00:26:33.591,00:26:35.052,"All right. He's got to get a running start, I guess."
00:26:35.052,00:26:38.264,All right.
00:26:38.264,00:26:41.225,Just leave.
00:26:41.225,00:26:43.060,What are you doing?
00:26:43.060,00:26:44.895,Why is he kneeling?
00:26:44.895,00:26:46.272,"What, does he, like..."
00:26:46.272,00:26:47.731,...pray at noon?
00:26:53.112,00:26:56.156,"Come on, leave."
00:27:04.331,00:27:07.126,Where is he?
00:27:12.506,00:27:14.007,"THURMAN: Yeah, left."
00:27:14.007,00:27:15.509,No. He was just at the door.
00:27:15.509,00:27:17.136,THURMAN: If you just go a little left.
00:27:17.136,00:27:18.720,All right. All right.
00:27:26.770,00:27:29.064,I wait.
00:27:36.029,00:27:37.615,What are you looking at?
00:27:37.615,00:27:40.033,Go back to work.
00:27:46.999,00:27:49.667,"Oh, God. Oh, shit."
00:27:56.674,00:27:57.843,"Oh, man."
00:27:57.843,00:27:59.595,"Oh, God."

00:28:19.865,00:28:21.575,Thanks.
00:28:24.828,00:28:27.122,Wait.
00:28:27.122,00:28:30.083,For you.
00:28:30.083,00:28:33.128,Second floor.
00:28:45.349,00:28:46.725,"Hi, baby."
00:28:46.725,00:28:48.935,"Come here, you."
00:28:54.191,00:29:00.239,GUPTA: I think he's CIA.
00:29:00.239,00:29:02.199,You don't know what the hell you're talking about.
00:29:02.199,00:29:03.992,That guy doesn't even speak English.
00:29:03.992,00:29:06.286,"If he could learn to speak, this guy."
00:29:06.286,00:29:10.583,"He can't speak English, how could he have a meeting with a beautiful woman?"
00:29:10.583,00:29:12.084,A flight attendant.
00:29:12.084,00:29:13.377,"Oh, so, she's CIA, too?"
00:29:13.377,00:29:15.212,No.
00:29:15.212,00:29:20.509,She look like a Russian.
00:29:20.509,00:29:22.802,And he gave her a piece of the paper.
00:29:22.802,00:29:24.304,Was it microfilm?
00:29:24.304,00:29:27.099,A coupon from Payless Shoes.
00:29:27.099,00:29:29.893,Must be some kind of the code.
00:29:29.893,00:29:34.898,"Buddy, I think you been spending too much time inhaling them cleaning products."
00:29:34.898,00:29:37.943,I'm warning you guys.
00:29:37.943,00:29:40.237,This guy is here for a reason.

00:36:07.082,00:36:10.502,"I won't lie, particularly to get rid of somebody like Viktor Navorski."
00:36:45.996,00:36:47.455,"MAX: Sorry, buddy."

00:42:26.878,00:42:31.132,Officer Torres.
00:42:31.132,00:42:35.053,"Enough, Viktor."
00:42:35.053,00:42:37.096,Who's telling you to ask me these things?
00:42:37.096,00:42:40.225,It's a man of misery.
00:42:42.268,00:42:44.229,Misery?
00:42:44.229,00:42:46.105,Mystery?
00:42:46.105,00:42:49.942,"No, no. Misery."
00:42:49.942,00:42:52.153,"Oh, he's so sick."
00:42:54.030,00:42:55.573,But what did she say?
00:42:55.573,00:42:58.826,"She did say, next, next."
00:42:58.826,00:43:01.662,"And now she say, Please. Please come."
00:43:01.662,00:43:03.581,That's... Wait.

00:43:09.087,00:43:11.964,I coming.
00:43:11.964,00:43:14.800,"Viktor, just tell me more. Hey..."
00:43:14.800,00:43:17.303,I coming. I coming.
00:43:17.303,00:43:19.097,"Please, please, please."
00:43:36.197,00:43:38.824,VIKTOR: Beeper went off.
00:43:38.824,00:43:40.659,"So, I grab. I come."
00:43:40.659,00:43:42.537,"Yeah, good."
00:43:42.537,00:43:44.747,"We... Okay, uh..."
00:43:44.747,00:43:45.998,You look like you're starving.
00:43:45.998,00:43:49.752,Oh. No. No food.
00:43:51.421,00:43:53.590,Okay. All right.
00:43:53.590,00:43:55.425,Thank you.
00:43:55.425,00:43:58.970,"So, Mr. Navorski, I have some very, very good news for you."
00:43:58.970,00:44:01.347,What?
00:44:01.347,00:44:04.225,I think that I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
00:44:04.225,00:44:06.144,How?
00:44:06.144,00:44:14.319,"Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country."
00:44:14.319,00:44:27.832,"If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum."
00:44:27.832,00:44:29.334,Asylum.
00:44:29.334,00:44:31.252,Mmm-hmm.
00:44:31.252,00:44:40.637,"Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would probably be six months from now."
00:44:40.637,00:44:46.643,"Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months."
00:44:46.643,00:44:49.604,It's the law.
00:44:49.604,00:44:52.731,You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
00:44:52.731,00:44:58.737,"But, believe it or not, most people they never show up before the judge."
00:44:58.737,00:45:01.115,So I go New York City?
00:45:01.115,00:45:02.367,Uh-huh.
00:45:02.367,00:45:04.994,You can go to New York City tonight.
00:45:04.994,00:45:09.415,But you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
00:45:09.415,00:45:10.833,Fear?
00:45:10.833,00:45:12.043,Mmm-hmm. Fear.
00:45:12.043,00:45:13.628,Fear. Fear.
00:45:13.628,00:45:15.547,From what?
00:45:15.547,00:45:17.756,"Well, that's the best part."
00:45:17.756,00:45:19.967,It doesn't really matter what you're afraid of.
00:45:19.967,00:45:22.387,"It's all the same to Uncle Sam, okay?"
00:45:22.387,00:45:24.805,"So I'm going to ask you one question, Viktor, and it's a simple question."
00:45:24.805,00:45:29.394,"And if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight."
00:45:31.396,00:45:34.691,"So, I answer one question."
00:45:34.691,00:45:37.109,Go to New York City.
00:45:37.109,00:45:38.444,Tonight.
00:45:38.444,00:45:40.613,Tonight.
00:45:41.780,00:45:44.158,Nah...
00:45:44.158,00:45:46.077,Okay.
00:45:46.077,00:45:48.162,Okay.
00:45:48.162,00:45:52.833,"Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?"
00:45:52.833,00:45:54.919,"Uh, no."
00:45:59.798,00:46:03.302,Okay.
00:46:03.302,00:46:04.721,"Your country's at war, Viktor."
00:46:04.721,00:46:06.847,"Yes, yes. War."
00:46:06.847,00:46:09.642,There are men in the streets with guns.
00:46:09.642,00:46:11.185,"Yes, yes."
00:46:11.185,00:46:12.729,"Yeah, it's horrible."
00:46:12.729,00:46:14.980,"And God only knows what could happen, right?"
00:46:14.980,00:46:17.233,Innocent people are torn from their beds and thrown into jail.
00:46:17.233,00:46:18.693,Yeah. On Tuesdays.
00:46:18.693,00:46:20.236,I hate Tuesdays.
00:46:20.236,00:46:22.154,So you're afraid.
00:46:22.154,00:46:23.656,From what?
00:46:23.656,00:46:25.700,Krakozhia.
00:46:25.700,00:46:28.077,You're afraid of Krakozhia.
00:46:28.077,00:46:30.747,Krakozhia?
00:46:30.747,00:46:34.709,"No. Uh, no, I am not afraid from Krakozhia."
00:46:34.709,00:46:38.713,I'm a little afraid of this room.
00:46:38.713,00:46:41.090,I'm talking about bombs.
00:46:41.090,00:46:42.634,I'm talking about human dignity.
00:46:42.634,00:46:45.177,I'm talking about human rights.
00:46:45.177,00:46:48.222,"Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me that you're afraid of Krakozhia."
00:46:50.015,00:46:55.020,Is home.
00:46:56.397,00:47:01.444,So?
00:47:01.444,00:47:02.654,No.
00:47:02.654,00:47:03.988,No?
00:47:03.988,00:47:06.198,Uh...
00:47:06.198,00:47:08.117,Okay.
00:47:08.117,00:47:10.953,I'm afraid from ghosts.
00:47:10.953,00:47:12.580,Okay.
00:47:12.580,00:47:14.499,I'm afraid from Dracula.
00:47:14.499,00:47:16.584,Thanks a lot.
00:47:16.584,00:47:17.918,I'm afraid from Wolfmens...
00:47:17.918,00:47:19.712,Thanks a lot.
00:47:19.712,00:47:21.130,...afraid from sharks.
00:47:21.130,00:47:22.632,Thanks a lot.
00:47:32.767,00:47:35.520,Why you do this?
00:47:35.520,00:47:38.105,Nobody read the sign in America.
00:47:39.482,00:47:42.694,This is the only fun I have.
00:47:42.694,00:47:46.364,AMELIA: A barbecue?
00:47:46.364,00:47:50.284,Let me get this straight.
00:47:50.284,00:48:00.586,"I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend the 4th of July with your wife?"
00:48:00.586,00:48:03.005,The woman hates fireworks.
00:48:04.382,00:48:07.092,"Don't lie to me, okay?"
00:48:07.092,00:48:10.763,I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
00:48:10.763,00:48:13.641,"Because you flew United, Max."
00:48:32.326,00:48:37.707,You make it a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?
00:48:37.707,00:48:40.418,"No, I try to call home."
00:48:40.418,00:48:44.129,So then...
00:48:44.129,00:48:46.048,You know why men are such assholes?
00:48:46.048,00:48:47.924,No.
00:48:51.679,00:48:54.557,Because they're all liars.
00:48:54.557,00:48:57.184,"Wait, wait, wait..."
00:48:57.184,00:48:58.770,"Wet, wet, wet..."
00:48:58.770,00:49:00.271,Wet floor.
00:49:00.271,00:49:02.022,"Please, please."
00:49:02.022,00:49:03.775,How can I not be?
00:49:03.775,00:49:05.818,One man. Two womens.
00:49:05.818,00:49:08.320,You want to know what the worst part is?
00:49:08.320,00:49:10.322,I never even asked him to leave his wife.
00:49:10.322,00:49:12.283,I was encouraging him to get counseling.
00:49:12.283,00:49:15.077,"I mean, what kind of sick person am I?"
00:49:15.077,00:49:18.664,I'm rooting for the home team.
00:49:23.335,00:49:26.004,I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
00:49:28.215,00:49:29.675,Okay.
00:49:29.675,00:49:31.968,All right.
00:49:31.968,00:49:40.185,"You know, sometimes in the mornings, I just stare at him over room service."
00:49:40.185,00:49:43.980,Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
00:49:43.980,00:49:49.069,"I start to think that maybe, maybe this could happen."
00:49:50.947,00:49:53.491,That we belong together.
00:49:53.491,00:49:55.660,Uh...
00:49:55.660,00:50:01.582,This man has you.
00:50:01.582,00:50:06.170,Why he need puzzle?
00:50:07.505,00:50:10.132,This is my problem.
00:50:10.132,00:50:13.093,I always see men the way I want to see 'em.
00:50:17.765,00:50:20.935,Do I know you from someplace?
00:50:20.935,00:50:23.813,Sensible heels.
00:50:26.482,00:50:28.943,Oh.
00:50:28.943,00:50:31.821,You headed for home?
00:50:31.821,00:50:35.240,Uh...
00:50:35.240,00:50:39.620,I am delayed a long time.
00:50:39.620,00:50:43.248,I hate it when they delay flights.
00:50:43.248,00:50:48.921,"Oh, I go from one building to another building."
00:50:48.921,00:50:52.466,I have beeper.
00:50:52.466,00:50:56.679,"Oh, contractors."
00:50:56.679,00:50:58.305,Ah.
00:51:00.056,00:51:02.434,Sorry about that.
00:51:02.434,00:51:04.144,What's BH?
00:51:04.144,00:51:09.358,"In English, Viktor Navorski."
00:51:09.358,00:51:12.820,"In English, Amelia Warren."
00:51:12.820,00:51:14.572,Amelia Warren?
00:51:14.572,00:51:16.657,Nice to meet you.
00:51:16.657,00:51:19.618,Nice to see you again.
00:51:19.618,00:51:21.704,Again.
00:51:21.704,00:51:24.415,You like Italian food?
00:51:24.415,00:51:32.214,"I know, it's late and you've probably got other plans, but if you'd like to grab some dinner right now, we can run right out and catch a cab."
00:51:32.214,00:51:35.801,I know a place that has the greatest cannelloni.
00:51:35.801,00:51:37.135,Uh...
00:51:37.135,00:51:39.972,"No, I can't."
00:51:39.972,00:51:41.640,You married?
00:51:41.640,00:51:43.350,Girlfriend?
00:51:43.350,00:51:44.936,No.
00:51:44.936,00:51:49.565,I can't go out with you.
00:51:53.360,00:51:56.948,God. I am so...
00:51:56.948,00:51:58.950,I am so sorry.
00:51:58.950,00:52:01.452,I must come off like a complete nut job or something.
00:52:01.452,00:52:03.287,"No, no."
00:52:03.287,00:52:04.956,I didn't want to eat alone.
00:52:04.956,00:52:07.041,"Wet, wet..."
00:52:07.041,00:52:08.584,"VIKTOR: No, I..."
00:52:08.584,00:52:09.877,"AMELIA: No, please."
00:52:09.877,00:52:11.503,"No, I..."
00:52:17.635,00:52:19.344,Nadia.
00:52:19.344,00:52:24.558,"In New York restaurant, what cost is cantaloni?"
00:52:24.558,00:52:26.560,I don't know.
00:52:26.560,00:52:27.853,Dollars?
00:52:27.853,00:52:29.063,Twenty.
00:52:29.063,00:52:31.482,"Two people, 40."
00:52:31.482,00:52:33.609,"Two people, 40 dollars."
00:52:41.659,00:52:44.620,"Two people, 40 dollars."
00:52:49.416,00:52:54.005,I help you?
00:52:54.005,00:52:58.843,"I'm so sorry, sir."
00:53:04.431,00:53:05.766,Do you live nearby?
00:53:05.766,00:53:07.935,"Yes, yes."
00:53:07.935,00:53:12.940,Because we are very particular about punctual...
00:53:12.940,00:53:14.358,Gate 67.
00:53:19.155,00:53:21.740,You got to be kidding.
00:53:21.740,00:53:24.035,You got to help me help you.
00:53:24.035,00:53:26.244,"I don't see a Social Security number, your Driver's License number..."
00:53:26.244,00:53:28.956,"...mailing address, even a phone number."
00:53:28.956,00:53:30.415,Telephone?
00:53:30.415,00:53:33.627,I get. I get.

00:53:55.691,00:53:57.401,Now?
00:54:28.849,00:54:29.975,Hello?
00:54:29.975,00:54:31.560,"CLIFF: Hi, Mr. Navorski."
00:54:31.560,00:54:33.938,"Yes, this is Viktor Navorski."
00:54:33.938,00:54:36.732,"It's Cliff, the Manager of the Discovery Store."
00:54:36.732,00:54:39.068,Ah! Cliff. Hello.
00:54:39.068,00:54:40.485,How's it going?
00:54:40.485,00:54:41.987,Is this a good time?
00:54:41.987,00:54:45.032,"Oh, yes, I wait for your call the whole day."
00:54:45.032,00:54:47.367,"Yeah, well, unfortunately, I got to tell you that the position's been filled."
00:54:47.367,00:54:49.078,Oh.
00:54:49.078,00:54:51.956,"Yeah, so could you please go sit someplace else?"
00:54:51.956,00:54:53.791,"Yeah, I go to bathroom now."
00:54:53.791,00:54:55.126,That'd be good.
00:54:55.126,00:54:56.460,All right.
00:54:56.460,00:54:57.878,CLIFF: Okay.
00:56:25.883,00:56:28.052,Who is this?
00:56:28.052,00:56:29.511,Who are you?
00:56:29.511,00:56:31.722,WORKER: It's no one.
00:56:31.722,00:56:33.849,There's no one here for another two weeks.
00:56:38.394,00:56:42.983,Look at this cornicing.
00:56:42.983,00:56:46.320,Must be Harry's crew.
00:56:46.320,00:56:47.779,Does Harry think he's running this job?
00:56:47.779,00:56:49.907,I go now.
00:56:49.907,00:56:51.158,Gate 67.
00:56:51.158,00:56:52.910,67?
00:56:52.910,00:56:55.329,We're ten months away from 67.
00:56:55.329,00:56:58.790,He's got to be Harry's.
00:56:58.790,00:57:01.335,Harry's trying to make me look bad.
00:57:01.335,00:57:03.712,I've got to slow that prick down before he gets to 67.
00:57:03.712,00:57:05.964,What's your name?
00:57:07.716,00:57:10.052,"Bobbie, pull him off Harry's crew, put him on mine."
00:57:10.052,00:57:12.512,You start 6:30 Monday morning.
00:57:12.512,00:57:15.391,You...
00:57:16.641,00:57:19.270,"6:30, yes, boss."
00:57:59.268,00:58:01.770,ENRIQUE: We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.
00:58:01.770,00:58:03.147,MAN: Good.

00:58:05.190,00:58:06.650,"GUPTA: Okay, okay."
00:58:06.650,00:58:07.818,"ENRIQUE: Hey, Viktor."
00:58:07.818,00:58:09.736,"Hello, all."
00:58:09.736,00:58:12.697,Look. The man without a country.
00:58:12.697,00:58:14.116,Come on in.
00:58:14.116,00:58:15.951,Welcome.
00:58:15.951,00:58:18.162,"Yeah, you did well."
00:58:18.162,00:58:19.413,Have a seat.
00:58:19.413,00:58:20.705,Here?
00:58:20.705,00:58:22.207,"Come on, sit down."
00:58:22.207,00:58:24.460,"Hey, who invited him?"
00:58:24.460,00:58:26.753,"I did. We needed a fourth, right?"
00:58:26.753,00:58:28.588,I'm not going to play with him.
00:58:28.588,00:58:30.090,"Oh, Gupta, relax, would you?"
00:58:30.090,00:58:31.925,He ain't a spy.
00:58:31.925,00:58:33.385,How do you know?
00:58:33.385,00:58:36.305,He could be recording everything we say.
00:58:36.305,00:58:38.223,A wire in his shirt.
00:58:38.223,00:58:41.477,A microphone up in his ass.
00:58:41.477,00:58:43.812,I'm not going to lose my job.
00:58:43.812,00:58:46.482,Fine.
00:58:46.482,00:58:48.066,Will you feel better if we X-rayed him?
00:58:48.066,00:58:49.651,GUPTA: Yes.
00:58:50.861,00:58:52.779,Close your eyes.
00:59:02.998,00:59:05.292,Okay.
00:59:05.292,00:59:06.918,Good.
00:59:06.918,00:59:09.921,I will have money.
00:59:09.921,00:59:12.299,Don't worry about it.
00:59:12.299,00:59:14.968,We don't play for cash.
00:59:14.968,00:59:18.514,You'll be amazed at what people leave at airports. Come.
00:59:18.514,00:59:21.433,I have two nines and two nines.
00:59:21.433,00:59:23.227,Oh. Four nines.
00:59:23.227,00:59:25.145,Thank you.
00:59:25.145,00:59:26.813,"Careful, careful."
00:59:26.813,00:59:28.315,"Wait, wait."
00:59:28.315,00:59:31.402,"Hey, we have a question for you, Viktor."
00:59:31.402,00:59:33.404,"Yeah, we're just curious."
00:59:33.404,00:59:34.863,What is in the can?
00:59:34.863,00:59:36.114,What? This?
00:59:36.114,00:59:38.409,"Yeah, we saw the X-ray."
00:59:38.409,00:59:40.744,We know there's no nuts in there.
00:59:40.744,00:59:43.205,What is in there?
00:59:43.205,00:59:46.208,This is jazz.
00:59:46.208,00:59:47.959,Jazz?
00:59:47.959,00:59:49.420,Jazz?
00:59:52.339,00:59:54.049,You sure it's jazz in there?
00:59:54.049,00:59:55.967,"Check again, it might be the blues."
00:59:55.967,00:59:57.344,Or some salsa.
00:59:57.344,00:59:58.720,"Yeah, maybe Stevie Wonder."
00:59:58.720,01:00:01.639,"No, no, is jazz."
01:00:01.639,01:00:04.560,"For tonight's grand prize, we have..."
01:00:05.936,01:00:07.812,"Show them, Gupta."
01:00:07.812,01:00:09.856,I found this upstairs.
01:00:09.856,01:00:12.443,"Virgin Air, first class lounge."
01:00:12.443,01:00:15.279,There you go.
01:00:15.279,01:00:17.114,And they belong to?
01:00:17.114,01:00:18.656,Cher.
01:00:18.656,01:00:20.409,Cher?
01:00:20.409,01:00:22.244,As in Cher?
01:00:22.244,01:00:23.703,Yeah.
01:00:23.703,01:00:25.663,I checked it out.
01:00:25.663,01:00:28.292,Those are Cher's panties.
01:00:28.292,01:00:30.210,Ready?
01:00:30.210,01:00:32.796,"So, will we share the panties?"
01:00:32.796,01:00:34.381,"No, no, no."
01:00:34.381,01:00:37.509,Come on.
01:00:37.509,01:00:44.141,...flight number 801 to Narita is now announcing final boarding...
01:00:44.141,01:00:47.311,VIKTOR: You can't.
01:00:49.396,01:00:52.107,You can get so confused.
01:00:52.107,01:00:55.693,"Viktor? Well, hi."
01:00:55.693,01:00:57.488,Ooh...
01:00:57.488,01:00:59.656,How are you?
01:00:59.656,01:01:01.617,"Oh, man."
01:01:01.617,01:01:06.538,"I've got to say I am so sorry about what happened last time, you know, asking you out like that."
01:01:06.538,01:01:13.711,"I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I finally meet somebody who keeps his hands in his pocket, I don't know how to react, so..."
01:01:13.711,01:01:15.297,"Let's just start over, huh?"
01:01:15.297,01:01:17.090,"Yes, okay."
01:01:17.090,01:01:18.592,I don't know.
01:01:18.592,01:01:21.136,Tell me about it.
01:01:21.136,01:01:22.513,Napoleon?
01:01:22.513,01:01:25.223,Yeah. Yeah. I read a lot of history books.
01:01:25.223,01:01:28.893,They're long and cheap and usually about men killing each other.
01:01:28.893,01:01:32.147,"Like 1,200 pages for $9.99."
01:01:32.147,01:01:33.940,But Napoleon?
01:01:33.940,01:01:36.568,Yeah.
01:01:36.568,01:01:37.861,You know what saved Napoleon's life?
01:01:37.861,01:01:39.070,No.
01:01:39.070,01:01:40.738,His ego.
01:01:40.738,01:01:42.032,Yep.
01:01:42.032,01:01:48.788,"After he loses the Battle of Waterloo, Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena."
01:01:48.788,01:01:54.670,"Now, no one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this."
01:01:54.670,01:01:59.049,He's very depressed and he decides to take his own life.
01:01:59.049,01:02:07.140,But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
01:02:07.140,01:02:13.313,"I mean, his stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die."
01:02:13.313,01:02:15.649,See? Ego.
01:02:15.649,01:02:17.108,Saved his life.
01:02:17.108,01:02:18.943,Maybe he need glasses.
01:02:18.943,01:02:21.821,Glasses?
01:02:21.821,01:02:23.615,Poison.
01:02:25.325,01:02:28.412,"You know, it's funny you should say that."
01:02:28.412,01:02:31.039,Rumor has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
01:02:31.039,01:02:32.999,There you go.
01:02:32.999,01:02:35.877,There you go.
01:02:35.877,01:02:38.714,I think we're rewriting history right here.
01:02:38.714,01:02:42.092,Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
01:02:42.092,01:02:44.844,"Oh, my God."
01:02:44.844,01:02:46.763,I just did it again.
01:02:48.890,01:02:51.435,"I'm so... Just stay away from me, Viktor, okay?"
01:02:51.435,01:02:54.688,I'm sick.
01:02:54.688,01:02:56.481,Okay.
01:02:56.481,01:02:59.817,"Okay, what?"
01:02:59.817,01:03:02.070,Lunch with you.
01:03:03.447,01:03:05.532,You'll have lunch with me?
01:03:05.532,01:03:08.034,You're not running for a flight or...
01:03:08.034,01:03:10.036,I wait.
01:03:11.288,01:03:12.789,Oh...
01:03:12.789,01:03:15.333,It's me.
01:03:15.333,01:03:18.044,"Oh, I'm sorry."
01:03:18.044,01:03:20.088,You work?
01:03:20.088,01:03:22.048,No.
01:03:22.048,01:03:23.216,Ah.
01:03:23.216,01:03:25.761,Three of you.
01:03:25.761,01:03:29.222,"Stay away from me, Viktor."
01:03:29.222,01:03:33.435,I'm...
01:03:33.435,01:03:37.355,I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
01:03:37.355,01:03:39.816,"You're not sick, Amelia. No."
01:03:39.816,01:03:44.195,No?
01:03:46.740,01:03:48.074,I have to go.
01:03:48.074,01:03:50.368,I have to stay.
01:03:50.368,01:03:51.953,Story of my life.
01:03:51.953,01:03:53.664,"Oh! Me, too."
01:04:10.347,01:04:12.683,THURMAN: Your CBP inspection's in three days.
01:04:12.683,01:04:19.690,"The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport at 9:00am, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins."
01:04:21.024,01:04:24.152,How much does Navorski make?
01:04:24.152,01:04:25.862,Sir?
01:04:25.862,01:04:29.825,How much does he make?
01:04:29.825,01:04:32.369,"I believe they're paying him cash under the table, sir."
01:04:32.369,01:04:35.747,I know that.
01:04:35.747,01:04:37.499,$19 an hour.
01:04:37.499,01:04:40.126,Unbelievable.
01:04:40.126,01:04:42.420,Do you know that's more than I make?
01:04:42.420,01:04:45.549,That's New York City construction.
01:04:45.549,01:04:48.343,"You know, one of my own men came up to me the other day."
01:04:48.343,01:04:50.928,Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
01:04:50.928,01:04:52.889,Look at him.
01:04:52.889,01:04:55.517,Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
01:04:55.517,01:04:57.644,Have you heard about this?
01:04:59.937,01:05:01.898,I have January 3rd.
01:05:06.486,01:05:08.405,Bring him in.
01:05:08.405,01:05:12.200,"Jake, he has no nationality."
01:05:12.200,01:05:17.622,"So, automatically, he's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12."
01:05:17.622,01:05:22.794,"So all I'm asking for, is that you to put him in a federal detention center and run a clearance on him."
01:05:24.796,01:05:27.006,"Well, what about a federal prison?"
01:05:28.216,01:05:30.844,"Well, what about another airport?"
01:05:30.844,01:05:34.055,Hello? Hello?
01:05:34.055,01:05:37.100,God damn it!
01:05:37.100,01:05:40.645,"I'm just detaining so many people, there's no goddamn room anywhere."
01:05:40.645,01:05:43.523,Did you try the FBI?
01:05:43.523,01:05:45.817,I tried everybody.
01:05:45.817,01:05:48.152,You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
01:05:48.152,01:05:52.198,"No. From now on, Navorski lives here."
01:06:01.207,01:06:08.465,"The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me."
01:06:08.465,01:06:12.093,But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
01:06:12.093,01:06:17.682,So let's show them why this is the number one airport in the United States.
01:06:17.682,01:06:25.941,"We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger."
01:06:25.941,01:06:29.277,"Uh, to be brought into the country, foodstuff..."
01:06:29.277,01:06:31.070,We keep it as clean as possible.
01:06:31.070,01:06:33.114,"Um, import, export."
01:06:33.114,01:06:34.365,Computer software.
01:06:34.365,01:06:36.033,That's a lot of walnuts.
01:06:36.033,01:06:39.287,"Um, yeah."
01:06:39.287,01:06:41.623,"Every time I go on business to Brazil, she makes me bring her back a bag."
01:06:41.623,01:06:44.501,Your mother-in-law?
01:06:44.501,01:06:46.461,Mind if I try one?
01:06:56.471,01:06:59.223,How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
01:06:59.223,01:07:01.685,"Well, if he's married, where is his wedding ring?"
01:07:01.685,01:07:04.395,"And if he's divorced, who in their right mind still talks to their mother-in-law?"
01:07:04.395,01:07:06.731,"I'm sorry, I mean, but really."
01:07:06.731,01:07:08.859,"No offense to mother-in-laws, but..."
01:07:08.859,01:07:11.068,Sir.
01:07:12.445,01:07:14.823,"Sir, we have a situation upstairs."
01:07:14.823,01:07:16.157,"Well, it's gonna have to wait."
01:07:16.157,01:07:17.534,No. This won't wait.
01:07:17.534,01:07:22.246,"When the 9:12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL."
01:07:22.246,01:07:24.666,"They tried to take the pills away from him, and he went nuts."
01:07:24.666,01:07:27.043,There he is.
01:07:27.043,01:07:28.795,"No, no, no."
01:07:28.795,01:07:31.548,Put your weapons down.
01:07:31.548,01:07:34.926,All right.
01:07:34.926,01:07:37.888,"We're here to help you, sir."
01:07:37.888,01:07:39.806,Where's he from?
01:07:39.806,01:07:41.140,The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
01:07:41.140,01:07:42.726,He'll be here in an hour.
01:07:42.726,01:07:44.227,"Okay, we gotta find somebody to talk to this guy."
01:07:44.227,01:07:46.270,"I have an idea, sir."
01:07:49.232,01:07:50.859,Viktor.
01:07:51.902,01:07:53.319,Viktor.
01:07:56.781,01:08:00.284,I need your help.
01:08:00.284,01:08:03.329,His name is Milodragovich.
01:08:03.329,01:08:07.291,"He may not speak exactly your dialect or whatever, but I need you to translate and help me out of a jam."
01:08:07.291,01:08:09.044,I help you? Why?
01:08:09.044,01:08:10.378,"Because I don't want anybody to get hurt, Viktor."
01:08:10.378,01:08:11.838,This guy's very upset.
01:08:11.838,01:08:13.548,"Just talk to him and calm him down, all right?"
01:08:13.548,01:08:15.216,"You do that, I'll let you back in the terminal."
01:08:15.216,01:08:16.593,No. New York.
01:08:16.593,01:08:18.720,No red stamp.
01:08:18.720,01:08:19.930,New York.
01:08:19.930,01:08:21.222,You say yes?
01:08:21.222,01:08:22.682,Yes?
01:08:22.682,01:08:25.101,"Okay. Okay, okay, okay."
01:08:25.101,01:08:27.395,"Mr. Milodragovich, we have somebody here to talk to you."
01:08:27.395,01:08:29.188,Stay out!
01:08:29.188,01:08:31.524,Stay out. Stay out.
01:08:47.331,01:08:49.208,So?
01:08:49.208,01:08:58.718,"Okay, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, he needs to have a Medicinal..."
01:08:58.718,01:09:01.554,...a Medicinal Purchase License.
01:09:01.554,01:09:03.723,Okay?
01:09:24.911,01:09:30.291,He say he bring the medicine for his father.
01:09:30.291,01:09:31.835,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
01:09:35.922,01:09:39.843,This why he go to Canada.
01:09:39.843,01:09:41.427,It doesn't matter.
01:09:41.427,01:09:43.220,His plane landed in the United States.
01:09:43.220,01:09:46.307,He needs to have the right form.
01:09:58.277,01:10:00.780,He did not know he need this document.
01:10:00.780,01:10:02.907,No one say to him he need document form.
01:10:02.907,01:10:04.575,"Well, I'm saying it to him."
01:10:04.575,01:10:10.165,He needs to have the form signed by the local hospital who is treating his father and a doctor in Canada.
01:10:10.165,01:10:12.876,These medicines have to stay in the United States now that they're here.
01:10:12.876,01:10:14.169,They have to stay here.
01:10:33.354,01:10:34.731,He's begging you.
01:10:34.731,01:10:36.691,I know.
01:10:36.691,01:10:38.151,I can see that.
01:10:41.237,01:10:43.073,"I'm sorry, sir."
01:10:43.073,01:10:45.742,You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
01:10:47.035,01:10:49.204,The medicine stays here.
01:10:50.163,01:10:53.332,I'm sorry.
01:10:55.793,01:10:58.088,WOMAN: Send him down.
01:11:02.884,01:11:06.179,All right. All right.
01:11:11.226,01:11:13.644,"Oh, oh, oh, hey. Uh..."
01:11:13.644,01:11:15.521,Goat.
01:11:15.521,01:11:17.941,What?
01:11:17.941,01:11:20.860,Medicine is for goat.
01:11:20.860,01:11:23.320,Goat?
01:11:23.320,01:11:26.824,Medicine is for goat.
01:11:28.076,01:11:29.326,He said that?
01:11:29.326,01:11:31.079,Yes.
01:11:31.079,01:11:32.872,He say...
01:11:32.872,01:11:37.835,We not understand.
01:11:37.835,01:11:40.797,Why? What are you saying?
01:11:40.797,01:11:42.799,That the medicine is not for his dying father?
01:11:42.799,01:11:44.968,VIKTOR: No. No.
01:11:44.968,01:11:49.931,The... Krakozhia...
01:11:44.968,01:11:52.308,The name for father sound like goat.
01:11:52.308,01:11:54.894,I make mistake.
01:12:02.652,01:12:05.155,"Why are you doing this, Viktor?"
01:12:05.155,01:12:08.532,Medicine is for goat.
01:12:08.532,01:12:09.784,"No, it's not."
01:12:09.784,01:12:11.077,"No, it's not."
01:12:11.077,01:12:12.829,No. No. No.
01:12:12.829,01:12:14.831,You've been reading the immigration forms.
01:12:14.831,01:12:16.082,Blue?
01:12:16.082,01:12:17.750,Blue?
01:12:17.750,01:12:21.296,"The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the Medicinal Purchase License."
01:12:21.296,01:12:23.631,You know it. No.
01:12:23.631,01:12:25.258,"That's very good, Viktor."
01:12:27.718,01:12:30.471,Why are you doing this? Huh?
01:12:30.471,01:12:33.141,You don't know him.
01:12:33.141,01:12:35.810,Look at me.
01:12:35.810,01:12:39.396,I was going to help you.
01:12:39.396,01:12:41.565,Now I want you to ask him one last...
01:12:41.565,01:12:43.776,"No, not you."
01:12:43.776,01:12:46.821,I want you to ask him.
01:12:46.821,01:12:50.950,I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
01:12:50.950,01:12:54.287,Please.
01:13:03.796,01:13:08.259,"Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich."
01:13:14.349,01:13:17.685,Okay. The pills stay.
01:13:17.685,01:13:20.521,Come on now. Let's go.
01:13:20.521,01:13:22.481,Take it easy. Come on.
01:13:25.568,01:13:27.820,Please. For goat.
01:13:27.820,01:13:31.241,Medicine for goat.
01:13:31.241,01:13:33.409,Medicine for goat.
01:13:33.409,01:13:35.870,Medicine for goat.
01:13:37.413,01:13:39.332,Give him the pills.
01:13:40.333,01:13:42.459,Medicine for goat.
01:13:43.794,01:13:45.755,Medicine... Medicine...
01:13:55.723,01:13:57.850,OFFICER: Come on now.
01:13:57.850,01:14:00.395,He love that goat.
01:14:03.480,01:14:05.400,Do you think this is a game? Huh?
01:14:05.400,01:14:08.485,Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
01:14:08.485,01:14:12.365,"You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States of America."
01:14:12.365,01:14:20.248,And then you'll know when that fight is over why the people of Krakozhia wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
01:14:28.631,01:14:31.301,GUPTA: There was a 20 man.
01:14:31.301,01:14:34.429,Immigration gun was drawn.
01:14:34.429,01:14:37.265,The Dixon was ready to fire.
01:14:37.265,01:14:40.684,To kill the little man with the pills.
01:14:40.684,01:14:46.774,But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
01:14:46.774,01:14:50.903,"Put the guns away, the man say."
01:14:50.903,01:14:53.156,Nobody will die today.
01:14:53.156,01:14:54.657,MAN: Who?
01:14:54.657,01:14:56.867,Who was it that saved him?
01:14:56.867,01:14:58.286,"Yeah, tell us."
01:14:58.286,01:14:59.996,Who was this man?
01:15:06.127,01:15:10.547,Navorski.
01:15:38.909,01:15:40.911,"It doesn't look good, Frank."
01:15:40.911,01:15:43.164,I was just following the rules.
01:15:43.164,01:15:47.751,"Sometimes you have to ignore the rules, ignore the numbers, and concentrate on the people."
01:15:47.751,01:15:49.837,"The people. Yeah, I know."
01:15:49.837,01:15:52.340,"The people, compassion, Frank."
01:15:52.340,01:15:55.426,Yeah.
01:15:55.426,01:15:58.012,You could learn something from Navorski.
01:15:59.930,01:16:02.725,Cheer up. It's not over yet.
01:16:29.293,01:16:32.046,Is that for me?
01:16:32.046,01:16:36.509,Is Virgin Isle sailfish.
01:16:36.509,01:16:38.344,For you.
01:16:38.344,01:16:40.930,For you.
01:16:40.930,01:16:42.890,For wall.
01:16:43.891,01:16:46.102,Fish for wall.
01:16:52.316,01:16:55.611,"Why do you want to go to New York, Viktor?"
01:16:55.611,01:16:57.905,And what's in the can of peanuts?
01:17:01.033,01:17:03.619,Promise.
01:17:03.619,01:17:04.995,A promise in the can?
01:17:04.995,01:17:06.830,Yes. A promise.
01:17:09.041,01:17:11.710,"Let me make you a promise, Viktor."
01:17:11.710,01:17:15.423,And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
01:17:15.423,01:17:18.259,A man who may be stuck here for the next 10 years.
01:17:21.345,01:17:26.100,"From now on, you and I are partners."
01:17:26.100,01:17:29.686,"If I stay, you stay."
01:17:29.686,01:17:34.525,You will not set one foot in New York City.
01:17:34.525,01:17:39.989,Not a single toe in the United States of America.
01:17:39.989,01:17:43.742,Do you understand what I am saying to you?
01:17:43.742,01:17:45.578,Yes.
01:17:46.787,01:17:49.081,You don't like fish.
01:18:09.893,01:18:12.729,Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
01:18:20.988,01:18:22.990,"You know, we don't have to do this, Viktor."
01:18:22.990,01:18:25.034,I can ship you out in a crate.
01:18:25.034,01:18:26.910,I can literally mail you anywhere in the United States.
01:18:26.910,01:18:28.579,"Hey, what about my food cart?"
01:18:28.579,01:18:30.540,"He can hide inside, and we'll drive right out."
01:18:30.540,01:18:32.875,No. No. No. I can't...
01:18:32.875,01:18:34.502,"Viktor, I thought you said you wanted us to help you."
01:18:34.502,01:18:35.752,I do.
01:18:35.752,01:18:37.087,"Okay, well, what's her name?"
01:18:37.087,01:18:38.714,Amelia Warren.
01:18:38.714,01:18:40.216,"I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in."
01:18:40.216,01:18:41.467,Okay. Here.
01:18:41.467,01:18:43.553,You better be careful.
01:18:43.553,01:18:45.555,"You know, those flight attendants ain't like regular women, Viktor."
01:18:45.555,01:18:49.058,"They're flying back and forth between all those time zones, kinda messes with their biological clock or something."
01:18:49.058,01:18:50.476,They're always ready for sex.
01:18:50.476,01:18:51.852,Why you think they can't stop smiling?
01:18:51.852,01:18:53.103,"Okay, I found something."
01:18:53.103,01:18:56.106,Shh!
01:18:56.106,01:18:57.941,They will come for us.
01:18:57.941,01:19:00.570,"Gupta, will you relax?"
01:19:00.570,01:19:03.573,You go in jail. Not me.
01:19:03.573,01:19:05.616,"MULROY: Oh, for..."
01:19:05.616,01:19:07.243,Just keep looking.
01:19:07.243,01:19:08.994,Yes. Yes.
01:19:08.994,01:19:10.538,Amelia Jane Warren?
01:19:10.538,01:19:12.415,Jane?
01:19:15.084,01:19:16.835,"Ooh, way to go, Viktor."
01:19:16.835,01:19:18.546,When she come back?
01:19:18.546,01:19:21.090,Uh... Three weeks.
01:20:02.256,01:20:05.968,"Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?"
01:20:07.470,01:20:11.557,Bite to eat? Cantaloni?
01:20:21.442,01:20:23.402,Bite to eat?
01:20:23.402,01:20:25.195,Bite to eat?
01:20:26.947,01:20:28.658,Bite to eat?
01:20:32.662,01:20:35.748,Eat to bite? Eat to bite.
01:20:35.748,01:20:40.210,Bite to eat.
01:20:40.210,01:20:41.545,Bite to eat?
01:20:41.545,01:20:43.213,Bite to eat?
01:20:43.213,01:20:44.923,Bite to eat?
01:20:44.923,01:20:46.425,Bite to eat?
01:20:46.425,01:20:47.802,Bite to eat?
01:20:47.802,01:20:49.720,Bite to eat?
01:20:55.434,01:20:58.604,"Gupta, you been ever married?"
01:20:59.814,01:21:01.064,What did you say?
01:21:01.064,01:21:03.066,You been ever married?
01:21:03.066,01:21:05.944,I had a wife and two kids in India.
01:21:05.944,01:21:09.323,I left them there 23 years ago.
01:21:09.323,01:21:11.534,Why?
01:21:11.534,01:21:15.746,I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
01:21:15.746,01:21:18.332,Made just enough money to survive.
01:21:18.332,01:21:23.629,One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
01:21:23.629,01:21:27.966,I said okay.
01:21:27.966,01:21:32.929,"But the next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming."
01:21:32.929,01:21:36.892,"And I am paying, and I'm paying him, and I'm paying him, and I'm paying him."
01:21:36.892,01:21:42.773,"And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest."
01:21:42.773,01:21:44.734,You killed policeman?
01:21:44.734,01:21:48.195,No. I just missed his heart.
01:21:48.195,01:21:50.865,"When they tried to arrest me, I just run away."
01:21:50.865,01:21:53.950,So you never go home?
01:21:53.950,01:21:58.873,"Oh, if I go home, I go in the jail for seven years."
01:22:01.041,01:22:04.503,What if United States catch you?
01:22:04.503,01:22:06.839,They deport you.
01:22:06.839,01:22:14.722,"As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me."
01:22:14.722,01:22:17.850,They have no reason to notice a man like me.
01:22:19.810,01:22:26.024,"United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome, Italy, is now arriving at Gate C43."
01:22:33.783,01:22:35.409,"Hey, wait."
01:22:35.409,01:22:37.244,Sorry. I'm sorry.
01:22:41.624,01:22:44.126,"No, no, no. It's wet. Wet."
01:22:48.171,01:22:49.465,Hey!
01:22:49.465,01:22:51.467,Watch where you're going.
01:22:51.467,01:22:54.219,Watch out.
01:22:54.219,01:22:57.013,Ooh!
01:22:57.013,01:22:58.682,Amelia.
01:22:58.682,01:22:59.975,Hello.
01:22:59.975,01:23:01.936,Sorry. I'm sorry.
01:23:01.936,01:23:03.479,He nearly killed me.
01:23:03.479,01:23:04.730,You okay?
01:23:04.730,01:23:06.148,I'm fine.
01:23:07.691,01:23:09.819,I love the suit.
01:23:09.819,01:23:11.862,Hugo Boss.
01:23:11.862,01:23:14.865,"On sale, $149.99."
01:23:14.865,01:23:16.867,That's a bargain.
01:23:16.867,01:23:18.118,Napoleon?
01:23:18.118,01:23:19.453,"Uh, yes, yes."
01:23:19.453,01:23:21.455,And Josephine.
01:23:21.455,01:23:24.374,Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
01:23:24.374,01:23:26.293,Amelia?
01:23:26.293,01:23:31.047,Would you like to have eat to bite?
01:23:31.047,01:23:32.842,Food. Tonight?
01:23:32.842,01:23:34.217,You're asking me out for dinner?
01:23:34.217,01:23:35.511,Yes.
01:23:35.511,01:23:37.304,Yeah. Sure.
01:23:37.304,01:23:38.639,What time?
01:23:38.639,01:23:41.057,Dinnertime.
01:23:41.057,01:23:42.434,AMELIA: Where do you want to go?
01:23:42.434,01:23:44.478,"Uh, I know place."
01:23:54.363,01:23:56.824,Do you have an appointment?
01:23:56.824,01:23:58.367,Navorski.
01:23:59.368,01:24:01.662,"This way, please."
01:24:10.337,01:24:12.339,Thank you.
01:24:14.591,01:24:17.928,I didn't know they had a patio up here.
01:24:17.928,01:24:19.972,It's very nice.
01:24:39.074,01:24:41.243,Good night.
01:24:45.330,01:24:48.208,Please. Please. Please.
01:24:48.208,01:24:52.546,"Sorry. So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken."
01:24:52.546,01:24:55.173,"Cannelloni, please."
01:24:55.173,01:24:57.259,Sorry.
01:24:57.259,01:24:58.552,"For you, sir?"
01:24:58.552,01:25:00.554,Uh... Same.
01:25:00.554,01:25:02.389,"That's a great, great choice."
01:25:02.389,01:25:04.140,I'll be back.
01:25:18.739,01:25:23.869,Let me see. Enjoy.
01:25:23.869,01:25:26.747,Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
01:25:26.747,01:25:29.083,Tell me.
01:25:29.083,01:25:36.590,"Um, it's 1742, and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night."
01:25:36.590,01:25:38.425,But the town bakers...
01:25:40.844,01:25:42.471,Sorry.
01:25:59.822,01:26:02.449,"So, the bakers?"
01:26:02.449,01:26:05.744,"No, never mind."
01:26:05.744,01:26:08.413,"No, please."
01:26:08.413,01:26:12.292,Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
01:26:12.292,01:26:15.462,I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't really give a shit.
01:26:15.462,01:26:17.255,I care.
01:26:17.255,01:26:20.550,Is histories. Is truth.
01:26:20.550,01:26:23.219,I'm 39 years old.
01:26:23.219,01:26:24.805,No.
01:26:24.805,01:26:26.807,Yeah.
01:26:26.807,01:26:27.975,That's the truth.
01:26:27.975,01:26:29.518,You are not.
01:26:29.518,01:26:35.816,"I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no."
01:26:35.816,01:26:37.693,I'm 39.
01:26:37.693,01:26:41.488,So? I was 39 once.
01:26:41.488,01:26:45.200,I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
01:26:45.200,01:26:47.870,I've been doing this over 20 years.
01:26:47.870,01:26:50.288,And now there's no more pretending.
01:26:50.288,01:26:52.457,This is it.
01:26:52.457,01:26:57.420,"It's why my address book is alphabetical by city, and my pager will always go off during dinner."
01:27:01.216,01:27:05.428,You can switch off pager.
01:27:05.428,01:27:07.389,I wish I could.
01:27:07.389,01:27:10.893,I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
01:27:10.893,01:27:13.311,"I know it's coming, Viktor."
01:27:13.311,01:27:15.981,That's why I can't break it off.
01:27:15.981,01:27:24.447,"That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend."
01:27:24.447,01:27:27.159,Yeah.
01:27:27.159,01:27:29.285,I've been waiting my whole life.
01:27:32.455,01:27:33.832,Just don't know what the hell for.
01:27:38.795,01:27:40.797,I'm so sorry.
01:27:58.732,01:28:01.026,I live here.
01:28:01.026,01:28:02.611,What?
01:28:02.611,01:28:03.820,"I live here, in terminal."
01:28:03.820,01:28:05.363,Gate 67.
01:28:06.489,01:28:07.741,You live at the airport?
01:28:07.741,01:28:09.659,Yes. Day and night.
01:28:09.659,01:28:13.247,"This home, like you."
01:28:13.247,01:28:15.249,So I wait.
01:28:15.249,01:28:18.252,"All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor."
01:28:18.252,01:28:20.712,Everybody's waiting.
01:28:20.712,01:28:22.881,"For a flight, for a meeting..."
01:28:22.881,01:28:25.134,I don't wait for flight.
01:28:25.134,01:28:26.718,Then what are you waiting for?
01:28:30.764,01:28:33.767,Is okay. I understand.
01:28:37.562,01:28:39.773,I have an idea.
01:28:39.773,01:28:41.733,Come here.
01:28:45.487,01:28:47.072,You sure?
01:28:47.072,01:28:49.158,"More than anything, I'm sure of this, Viktor."
01:28:49.158,01:28:51.868,Ready?
01:29:06.883,01:29:09.886,"VIKTOR: So, when do you come back?"
01:29:09.886,01:29:13.307,AMELIA: 13 days.
01:29:13.307,01:29:16.226,VIKTOR: I... I will be here.
01:29:16.226,01:29:19.104,AMELIA: But what if your schedule changes?
01:29:19.104,01:29:21.273,Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
01:29:21.273,01:29:24.318,VIKTOR: No. I will be here.
01:29:24.318,01:29:30.240,You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
01:29:30.240,01:29:32.868,Tell me.
01:29:32.868,01:29:34.536,"Oh, come on. Tell me."
01:29:34.536,01:29:39.499,I will show you.
01:29:39.499,01:29:40.876,Hmm?
01:30:48.110,01:30:49.527,What's he doing?
01:30:49.527,01:30:51.071,I can't ask him what he's doing.
01:30:51.071,01:30:53.407,I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
01:30:53.407,01:30:55.533,"If I ask him, I look like an idiot."
01:31:13.093,01:31:17.180,I'm sorry. Sorry.
01:31:17.180,01:31:20.767,I promise you're gonna get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
01:31:20.767,01:31:24.896,"But, please, do this for me."
01:31:43.915,01:31:48.044,He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
01:31:52.424,01:31:55.218,I have to work.
01:31:55.218,01:31:57.262,He will wait.
01:33:01.159,01:33:02.827,How was your flight?
01:33:04.246,01:33:06.248,Thanks.
01:33:10.460,01:33:12.337,Is something wrong?
01:33:12.337,01:33:14.172,"You'll have to come with us, ma'am."
01:33:14.172,01:33:15.549,You gotta be kidding.
01:33:15.549,01:33:17.717,I come through here twice a month.
01:33:17.717,01:33:19.886,Please follow me.
01:33:19.886,01:33:22.347,I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
01:33:45.245,01:33:48.706,"DIXON: In my line of work, there are three things that matter."
01:33:48.706,01:33:53.795,"The person, the document and the story."
01:33:55.505,01:33:59.509,"Find the truth of one, and you find the truth of all three."
01:33:59.509,01:34:02.471,I need your help finding the truth.
01:34:03.846,01:34:06.849,Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
01:34:06.849,01:34:08.810,Yes.
01:34:08.810,01:34:12.481,Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
01:34:12.481,01:34:15.442,No. We're just friends.
01:34:15.442,01:34:21.364,Have you noticed that he hides a can of Planters dry roasted peanuts in his bag?
01:34:21.364,01:34:23.283,So?
01:34:23.283,01:34:24.618,What do you make of that?
01:34:26.744,01:34:29.205,"I'd make peanut butter, I guess."
01:34:31.166,01:34:35.128,We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
01:34:35.128,01:34:37.130,Has he told you why he's in New York?
01:34:37.130,01:34:38.798,No.
01:34:38.798,01:34:40.758,Has he told you where he lives?
01:34:40.758,01:34:42.844,No.
01:34:42.844,01:34:46.889,"All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase."
01:34:46.889,01:34:48.141,That's it.
01:34:48.141,01:34:49.434,He's a contractor?
01:34:49.434,01:34:50.684,Yeah.
01:34:50.684,01:34:53.188,That's what he said?
01:34:55.689,01:34:59.486,Amelia. I'm just curious.
01:34:59.486,01:35:04.199,You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
01:35:06.826,01:35:10.788,Why Viktor Navorski?
01:35:10.788,01:35:15.418,That's something a guy like you could never understand.
01:35:38.358,01:35:41.069,I guess you missed your flight again.
01:35:41.069,01:35:43.363,Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
01:35:43.363,01:35:45.574,Please. Please. Sit.
01:35:45.574,01:35:48.742,"It's okay, Viktor."
01:35:48.742,01:35:50.579,At least you're not very good at it.
01:35:50.579,01:35:52.706,I did not lie.
01:35:52.706,01:35:57.210,You told me you were delayed.

01:38:27.943,01:38:30.572,This is jazz.
01:38:36.578,01:38:45.670,"My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper, 1958."
01:38:45.670,01:38:48.590,He say he look at photograph for seven days.
01:38:48.590,01:38:50.759,"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday..."

01:40:04.707,01:40:07.251,All but not one.
01:40:08.962,01:40:11.380,Benny Golson.
01:40:14.175,01:40:16.886,Saxophone.

01:40:43.287,01:40:46.248,Maybe I think he do it for me.
01:40:51.921,01:40:57.218,You say you are waiting for something.
01:40:57.218,01:41:01.347,"And I say to you, Yes, yes."

01:42:18.007,01:42:21.343,...the right wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin...
01:42:48.245,01:42:51.457,"All right, everybody."
01:42:51.457,01:42:55.168,"Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor The Goat."

01:44:13.039,01:44:15.041,I think you were confused.
01:44:15.041,01:44:17.001,"No, I confused about everything."

01:44:56.498,01:45:01.254,"In the distance, the Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings."
01:45:01.254,01:45:03.131,It is a clear sign of the power...
01:45:05.091,01:45:07.593,"Hey, baby."
01:45:08.677,01:45:10.429,I missed you.

01:46:00.313,01:46:02.439,What?

01:46:10.239,01:46:11.991,Dixon?
01:46:11.991,01:46:14.243,Yes.
01:46:14.243,01:46:15.953,Dixon.
01:46:20.041,01:46:25.213,The war in my country is over.
01:46:25.213,01:46:30.301,Yeah. I know.
01:46:30.301,01:46:33.428,"It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?"
01:46:33.428,01:46:36.057,When you wait so long for one thing?
01:46:36.057,01:46:39.268,One tiny moment.
01:46:39.268,01:46:41.979,"I had that moment today, too."
01:46:41.979,01:46:44.523,You see this badge?
01:46:44.523,01:46:48.152,This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
01:46:48.152,01:46:52.323,It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
01:46:54.575,01:46:57.370,Your ticket and your passport.
01:46:59.288,01:47:02.415,It's time for you to go home.
01:47:05.836,01:47:12.718,"Officer Waylin, will you please show Mr. Navorski into the terminal and make sure that he does not miss his flight."
01:47:12.718,01:47:15.054,"Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck."
01:47:25.314,01:47:28.441,I think I want go New York City.
01:47:29.860,01:47:32.071,"Don't make this difficult, Viktor."
01:47:32.071,01:47:34.865,I no more unacceptable.
01:47:34.865,01:47:36.700,I told you this is over.
01:47:36.700,01:47:38.911,I go New York.
01:47:41.247,01:47:43.707,Are you sure you want to do that?
01:47:44.959,01:47:47.628,I go New York City now.
01:47:52.049,01:47:58.764,"Part of my job as Field Commissioner is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few."
01:47:58.764,01:48:01.434,"Like this guy, Joe Mulroy."
01:48:01.434,01:48:05.646,"Joe's been here for about 20 years, but it turns out he's been running an after-hour poker game."
01:48:05.646,01:48:07.898,Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
01:48:07.898,01:48:09.442,Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
01:48:09.442,01:48:11.610,"And I think he has kids, too."
01:48:11.610,01:48:13.112,Yep.
01:48:13.112,01:48:15.948,"And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz."
01:48:15.948,01:48:17.908,I think you also know Enrique.
01:48:17.908,01:48:22.997,"Enrique, as it turns out, has been letting people into the food preparation area."
01:48:22.997,01:48:25.082,That's a major security breach.
01:48:25.082,01:48:27.418,"The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed."
01:48:27.418,01:48:29.628,But I'm going to have to let him go.
01:48:29.628,01:48:33.090,And then there's Gupta Rajan.
01:48:33.090,01:48:40.222,"But as it turns out, he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979."
01:48:40.222,01:48:42.391,I'll have to deport him.
01:48:42.391,01:48:45.394,I will go home.
01:48:45.394,01:48:46.937,I'm sorry.
01:48:46.937,01:48:49.273,I will go home.
01:48:49.273,01:48:51.817,Leave them alone.
01:48:51.817,01:48:53.861,Today.
01:48:53.861,01:48:56.322,"If you don't get on that plane, Viktor, they're all gone."
01:48:56.322,01:48:57.490,"Yes, yes."
01:48:57.490,01:48:59.033,Do you understand?
01:48:59.033,01:49:00.784,Okay. Good.
01:49:14.340,01:49:15.924,I don't believe you.
01:49:15.924,01:49:18.219,"Viktor, you don't have to do this."
01:49:18.219,01:49:19.512,"Viktor, you can fight these guys, okay?"
01:49:19.512,01:49:20.721,We'll help you.
01:49:20.721,01:49:22.431,"Viktor, come on."
01:49:22.431,01:49:23.974,Please let me help you.
01:49:23.974,01:49:25.976,"Viktor, listen to him."
01:49:25.976,01:49:28.020,"Viktor, we're all your friends."
01:49:32.983,01:49:34.567,Gupta.
01:49:34.567,01:49:35.986,Goodbye.
01:49:35.986,01:49:39.073,You try to fool us.
01:49:39.073,01:49:43.869,"You make us to think you would walk out those door, that you will fight with them."
01:49:43.869,01:49:45.704,Why don't you fight?
01:49:45.704,01:49:47.456,The war is over.
01:49:47.456,01:49:50.334,Then go. Get lost.
01:49:50.334,01:49:55.047,Get lost.
01:49:55.047,01:50:03.596,"You come this close to America, but you don't have the courage to go from here to here."
01:50:04.557,01:50:06.725,You are a coward.
01:50:06.725,01:50:09.686,The plane is on time.
01:50:09.686,01:50:12.022,You are a coward.
01:50:12.022,01:50:15.317,You are a coward!
01:50:15.317,01:50:16.818,You make me sick!
01:50:16.818,01:50:20.281,"What's wrong with you, man?"
01:50:20.281,01:50:24.076,"Got people looking all around, looking at me like I'm..."
01:50:26.245,01:50:28.163,Look at me.
01:50:28.163,01:50:30.623,"Come on, look at me."
01:50:35.379,01:50:37.923,There's something you should know.
01:50:41.843,01:50:48.641,"Ladies and gentlemen, United Airlines Flight 865 from Krakozhia has landed and is now taxiing to the gate."
01:50:48.641,01:50:54.106,"For those passengers holding tickets for Flight 866 to Krakozhia, we expect departure to be on schedule."
01:51:22.050,01:51:24.011,Gupta.
01:51:36.231,01:51:37.608,Gupta!
01:52:09.640,01:52:12.851,I am going home.
01:52:16.104,01:52:18.607,Get lost.
01:52:29.284,01:52:31.286,"Your attention, please."
01:52:31.286,01:52:36.833,Flight 866 to Krakozhia will be delayed until further notice.
01:52:44.883,01:52:47.135,Do you have an appointment?
01:52:49.846,01:52:53.100,Would somebody please tell me what the hell is going on down there?
01:52:55.561,01:52:57.396,We're right behind you.
01:53:01.816,01:53:03.776,Viktor's leaving.
01:53:18.375,01:53:20.502,"Monica, Viktor's leaving."
01:53:20.502,01:53:22.421,I know. He's going home.
01:53:22.421,01:53:24.632,He's going for the front door.
01:53:24.632,01:53:27.884,"What? Oh, my..."
01:53:35.267,01:53:37.978,Viktor. Remember us.
01:53:37.978,01:53:40.648,"Hey, on behalf of Discovery Store, I want to give you this little blue squishy."
01:53:40.648,01:53:41.940,You squish it.
01:53:41.940,01:53:43.900,A digital camera for Cousin Katia.
01:53:43.900,01:53:47.820,"I don't know where you're going, Viktor, but these will keep your feet warm when you get there."
01:53:56.997,01:53:58.248,"Okay, everybody in position?"
01:53:58.248,01:53:59.500,THURMAN: We're here.
01:53:59.500,01:54:01.126,That's it.
01:54:12.805,01:54:14.598,"WAYLIN: Sorry, Viktor."
01:54:18.268,01:54:19.812,"Take him, Judge."
