00:01:17.160,00:01:20.247,Turn the... up! Now!
00:01:20.288,00:01:21.331,Good.
00:02:41.453,00:02:44.498,"Whoa, nobody caught me."
00:02:44.539,00:02:46.792,I don't think he's moving.
00:02:56.927,00:03:01.473,"He is a lazy freeloader, and it's time for all this dysfunction to stop."
00:03:01.515,00:03:03.934,"Can't we, can't we just do this later?"
00:03:03.976,00:03:06.979,"I mean, you know how he gets in the morning."
00:03:07.021,00:03:11.692,"Ned, aren't you tired of letting people push you around?"
00:03:11.733,00:03:13.527,Yes.
00:03:13.568,00:03:16.697,Then get in there and do it.
00:03:18.615,00:03:21.702,Oh. What?
00:03:21.743,00:03:23.162,What is it?
00:03:23.202,00:03:24.663,"Dewey, hey..."
00:03:24.705,00:03:27.041,"it's the first of the month and, uh..."
00:03:27.082,00:03:29.543,"I would like your share of the rent now, please."
00:03:29.584,00:03:31.545,"Oh, man, you know I don't have it."
00:03:31.586,00:03:32.963,You wake me up for that?
00:03:33.005,00:03:34.255,"Come on, man!"
00:03:34.297,00:03:36.925,Sorry.
00:03:39.928,00:03:43.473,"Dewey, I mean, you owe me a lot of money as it is."
00:03:43.515,00:03:45.475,"Yeah, try $2,200."
00:03:45.517,00:03:47.644,"Okay, you guys?"
00:03:47.686,00:03:49.980,The band is about to hit it big time.
00:03:50.022,00:03:55.736,"We're going to win Battle of the Bands, and when I'm rolling in the Benjamins, I will throw you and your dog a bone."
00:03:55.777,00:03:57.404,Good night.
00:03:57.445,00:03:59.239,Your band has never made two cents.
00:03:59.280,00:04:00.657,"Patty, come on, I'm on this."
00:04:00.699,00:04:02.743,"Oh, you're on this?"
00:04:02.784,00:04:04.619,He's walking all over you.
00:04:04.661,00:04:06.830,"Mommy, could we please talk about this later?"
00:04:06.872,00:04:11.085,"Uh, no, we can't talk about it later because Ned and I have to go to work."
00:04:11.126,00:04:12.669,We have jobs.
00:04:12.711,00:04:14.629,"We contribute to society, all right?"
00:04:14.671,00:04:18.759,"I am an assistant to the mayor of this city, hello?"
00:04:18.800,00:04:20.468,"Why? Can you get her out of here, please?"
00:04:20.510,00:04:21.845,Why? Why her?
00:04:21.887,00:04:25.682,And Ned has the most important job there is.
00:04:25.724,00:04:26.808,Temping?
00:04:26.850,00:04:29.436,"Dewey, a substitute teacher is not a temp."
00:04:29.477,00:04:30.687,He's a baby-sitter.
00:04:30.729,00:04:32.189,"Oh, yeah? You think it's so easy?"
00:04:32.231,00:04:33.565,"Well, I'd like to see you try."
00:04:33.607,00:04:34.858,You wouldn't last one day.
00:04:34.900,00:04:36.818,"Dude, I service society by rocking, okay?"
00:04:36.860,00:04:40.488,I'm out there on the front lines liberating people with my music.
00:04:40.530,00:04:42.574,"Rocking ain't no walk in the park, lady."
00:04:42.616,00:04:44.910,"All right, this is useless, all right?"
00:04:44.952,00:04:50.582,"You tell him that if he doesn't come up with the rent by the end of the week, he's out of here."
00:04:50.624,00:04:54.628,"Dewey, I'm not paying your share of the rent, so, I don't know."
00:04:54.669,00:04:57.380,"I mean, maybe you should sell one of your guitars or something."
00:04:57.422,00:04:59.466,What?
00:04:59.507,00:05:01.760,Would you tell Picasso to sell his guitars?
00:05:01.802,00:05:06.140,"Oh, my God."
00:05:06.181,00:05:07.849,Dude...
00:05:07.891,00:05:12.520,"I've been mooching off you for years, and it's never been a problem until she showed up."
00:05:12.562,00:05:13.981,"Just dump her, man."
00:05:14.022,00:05:16.858,"Yeah, well, if you don't come up with some money, she's going to dump me; she's fed up."
00:05:16.900,00:05:18.526,Really? Because that would be a good thing.
00:05:18.568,00:05:19.945,She's a nightmare.
00:05:19.987,00:05:23.323,Come on. I may never have another girlfriend...
00:05:23.364,00:05:24.699,"I mean, just come on."
00:05:24.741,00:05:27.786,"Come up with some money, please."
00:05:27.828,00:05:29.663,Okay. For you.
00:05:29.704,00:05:31.748,"Not for her, man. For you."
00:05:31.790,00:05:32.833,Thank you.
00:05:36.544,00:05:37.921,D minor...
00:05:41.049,00:05:42.717,Hey!
00:05:42.759,00:05:45.179,Hey! What's up?
00:05:45.220,00:05:46.763,Is that a new song?
00:05:46.805,00:05:48.723,Who's this guy?
00:05:48.765,00:05:51.392,we're taking the Battle of the Bands seriously this year.
00:05:51.434,00:05:54.479,"Good, 'cause I need the money."
00:05:51.434,00:05:58.692,"Now listen, my feeling is, if we're going to win this thing, we've got to actually start playing some music."
00:05:58.733,00:06:00.068,I agree. You're fired.
00:06:00.110,00:06:03.989,And your lyrics-- don't take this the wrong way-- are lame.
00:06:04.031,00:06:07.366,"But I've been sitting on some awesome material, so..."
00:06:07.408,00:06:09.870,"Dewey, did you hear what I said?"
00:06:09.911,00:06:11.872,We voted.
00:06:11.913,00:06:13.372,You're out.
00:06:13.414,00:06:15.416,This is Spider; he's replacing you.
00:06:15.458,00:06:17.627,"What's up, dawg?"
00:06:19.587,00:06:22.341,"I was going to tell you last night, Dewey, but you passed out, man."
00:06:22.381,00:06:25.302,"Okay, you're going to kick me out of the band, huh?"
00:06:25.344,00:06:26.720,You're going to fire me?
00:06:26.761,00:06:28.429,"Well, this is my band; I brought us together."
00:06:28.471,00:06:30.932,"Theo wanted you out, man, and there's nothing I could do."
00:06:30.974,00:06:32.726,"Oh, shut up, man."
00:06:32.767,00:06:34.728,I didn't tell you what to do.
00:06:34.769,00:06:36.688,"THEO: Dewey, listen to me."
00:06:36.730,00:06:38.690,You're a good guitar player.
00:06:38.732,00:06:41.735,"But it's, it's the 20-minute solos."
00:06:41.776,00:06:43.737,It's the stage dives.
00:06:43.778,00:06:47.782,"We're trying to land a record deal here, man, and you're an embarrassment."
00:06:49.450,00:06:51.203,"Read between the lines, Theo."
00:06:51.245,00:06:53.663,Read between the lines!
00:06:53.705,00:06:57.292,"Dewey, man, I hope this doesn't come between us."
00:06:57.334,00:06:58.626,"Like, I care about you, man."
00:06:58.668,00:07:00.587,"You guys, you know what?"
00:07:00.628,00:07:02.172,You're nuts.
00:07:02.214,00:07:07.468,"You've been focused so hard on making it, you forgot about one little thing-- it's called the music."
00:07:07.510,00:07:08.845,And I don't even care.
00:07:08.887,00:07:10.597,You know what? So what.
00:07:10.638,00:07:13.433,I don't want to hang out with a bunch of wanna-be corporate sellouts.
00:07:13.474,00:07:17.229,"I'm going to form my own band and we are going to start a revolution, okay?"
00:07:17.271,00:07:22.692,And you're going to be a funny little footnote on my epic ass.
00:07:30.825,00:07:34.037,I feel sorry for you guys.
00:07:37.707,00:07:39.834,DEWEY: Uh-huh. Yes. Mm-hmm.
00:07:39.876,00:07:43.130,"Yeah, it's a 1968 Gibson SG."
00:07:43.171,00:07:47.175,Mint condish.
00:07:47.217,00:07:48.302,No.
00:07:48.343,00:07:51.471,That's all?
00:07:51.512,00:07:53.181,"No, Hendrix played this guitar."
00:07:53.223,00:07:56.684,Hel... Hello?
00:08:05.068,00:08:05.986,Yeah.
00:08:06.027,00:08:07.446,WOMAN: Is this Mr. Schneebly?
00:08:07.487,00:08:08.696,"Nah, he's not here."
00:08:08.738,00:08:10.949,Oh. Could you take a message for me?
00:08:10.991,00:08:12.451,"Um, yeah."
00:08:12.492,00:08:14.328,Hi. My name is Rosalie Mullins.
00:08:14.369,00:08:19.499,"I'm the principal here at Horace Green Prep, and we are having a little emergency here."
00:08:19.540,00:08:24.921,"One of our teachers broke her leg on the way to school this morning, and all of our subs are already working."
00:08:24.963,00:08:29.509,Pat Wickam at Milton Prep recommended I give Mr. Schneebly a call.
00:08:29.550,00:08:30.844,Do you know if he's available?
00:08:30.885,00:08:33.638,Uh... how long is the gig?
00:08:33.680,00:08:34.848,Excuse me?
00:08:34.889,00:08:37.517,"Uh, how long is the job?"
00:08:37.558,00:08:41.980,"My guess is as much as a few weeks, but we do need somebody to start immediately."
00:08:42.022,00:08:44.858,Mm-hmm.
00:08:44.899,00:08:48.653,We pay our substitutes $650 a week.
00:08:48.695,00:08:52.032,"Now, do you know when Mr. Schneebly will be back?"
00:08:52.073,00:08:54.868,Hold on a sec.
00:08:54.909,00:08:56.495,I think he's just coming in right n...
00:08:56.536,00:08:59.706,"Ned, phone!"
00:09:05.253,00:09:07.839,"Hello, this is Ned Schneebly."
00:09:18.892,00:09:21.019,ROSALIE: Pat faxed me your resume.
00:09:21.061,00:09:23.438,It's very impressive.
00:09:23.480,00:09:26.733,"We've never been in a bind like this before, so thank you so much."
00:09:26.774,00:09:28.068,So how's this going to work?
00:09:28.109,00:09:29.777,Are you going to pay me up front?
00:09:29.819,00:09:31.405,"I, I don't understand."
00:09:31.446,00:09:34.741,It would be really great if I could get paid now in cash.
00:09:34.782,00:09:36.659,Oh. Well.
00:09:36.701,00:09:40.955,"Okay, well when you cut my check, just make it payable to Dewey Finn, for tax reasons."
00:09:40.997,00:09:44.959,"You can discuss all of that with Candace in Administration, at the end of the day."
00:09:45.001,00:09:46.336,"Okay, when's the end of the day?"
00:09:46.378,00:09:49.630,"We commence at 8:15, and school lets out at 3:00."
00:09:49.672,00:09:52.300,Oh. Uh-oh.
00:09:52.342,00:09:54.969,Do you think I could cut out a little early today?
00:09:55.011,00:09:57.264,I got some stuff I got to do.
00:09:58.848,00:10:01.601,It's cool. I can stay.
00:10:01.642,00:10:04.062,Mr. Schneebly...
00:10:04.104,00:10:12.904,"this is considered the best elementary school in the state, and we maintain that reputation by adhering to a strict code of conduct-- faculty included."
00:10:12.946,00:10:14.489,You know what?
00:10:12.946,00:10:19.119,"You don't have to worry about me because I'm a hard-ass, and if a kid gets out of line, I got no problem smacking them in the head."
00:10:19.160,00:10:20.954,"No. No, no."
00:10:20.995,00:10:22.789,We don't use corporal punishment here.
00:10:22.830,00:10:26.334,"Okay, so just verbal abuse?"
00:10:26.376,00:10:30.671,"Mr. Schneebly, if you have any problems with any of your students, you just send them to me."
00:10:30.713,00:10:31.506,I will do the disciplining.
00:10:31.548,00:10:33.967,Check.
00:10:37.471,00:10:40.640,Children...
00:10:40.681,00:10:43.893,please take your seats.
00:10:43.935,00:10:47.439,"Everyone, I'd like to introduce Ms. Dunham's substitute."
00:10:47.481,00:10:50.108,This is Mr. Schneebly.
00:10:50.150,00:10:52.319,Why don't you write your name on the board.
00:10:52.360,00:10:53.778,Yes...
00:10:53.820,00:10:56.406,"Yes, I will."
00:11:03.913,00:11:05.165,You know what?
00:11:05.206,00:11:10.086,Why don't you all just call me Mr. S.
00:11:10.128,00:11:18.219,"Mr. S. has never taught here at Horace Green, so I want you all to be on your best behavior."
00:11:18.261,00:11:19.971,So the curriculum is on the desk.
00:11:20.013,00:11:22.307,And do you have any questions?
00:11:22.349,00:11:25.185,"Yeah, when's lunch?"
00:11:25.226,00:11:27.770,The children just had their lunch.
00:11:27.812,00:11:30.398,Is there anything else you need?
00:11:30.440,00:11:31.858,Uh...
00:11:31.899,00:11:33.276,I'm a teacher.
00:11:33.318,00:11:35.778,All I need are minds for molding.
00:11:35.820,00:11:37.071,"All right, then."
00:11:37.113,00:11:40.283,"Well, thanks again; you saved the day."
00:11:47.207,00:11:50.210,"Okay, who's got food in here?"
00:11:52.920,00:11:54.548,You're not going to get in trouble.
00:11:54.589,00:11:56.257,I'm hungry.
00:11:58.092,00:11:59.427,You.
00:11:59.469,00:12:01.471,What do you got?
00:12:05.433,00:12:06.893,Mm-hmm.
00:12:06.934,00:12:09.437,That's what I'm talking about.
00:12:11.439,00:12:13.774,Okay.
00:12:13.816,00:12:15.402,Teach. Teach.
00:12:15.443,00:12:19.614,"Teach. All right, look, here's the deal."
00:12:19.656,00:12:21.740,I've got a hangover.
00:12:21.782,00:12:23.410,Who knows what that means?
00:12:23.451,00:12:26.204,Doesn't that mean you're drunk?
00:12:26.246,00:12:28.373,No. It means I was drunk yesterday.
00:12:28.415,00:12:30.291,It means you're an alcoholic.
00:12:30.333,00:12:31.959,Wrong.
00:12:32.001,00:12:34.921,You wouldn't come to work hungover unless you were an alcoholic.
00:12:34.962,00:12:37.215,"Dude, you got a disease."
00:12:37.257,00:12:38.883,Hmm. Hmm.
00:12:38.925,00:12:40.218,What's your name?
00:12:40.260,00:12:41.261,Freddy Jones.
00:12:41.302,00:12:43.388,"Hmm. Freddy Jones, shut up."
00:12:44.514,00:12:46.266,Shut up.
00:12:46.307,00:12:48.602,"The point is, you all can just chill today."
00:12:48.643,00:12:52.980,We'll start on this crap-ola tomorrow.
00:12:53.981,00:12:55.609,"Yes, Tinkerbell?"
00:12:55.650,00:12:56.610,Summer.
00:12:56.651,00:13:01.155,"As class factotum, first, I'd like to just say welcome to Horace Green."
00:13:01.197,00:13:02.365,Thank you.
00:13:02.407,00:13:03.782,Do you have any questions about our schedule?
00:13:03.824,00:13:10.957,"'Cause usually now Ms. Dunham teaches vocabulary, then gives us a pop quiz, then she'll split us up into our reading groups."
00:13:10.998,00:13:12.626,Track B is...
00:13:12.667,00:13:21.175,"Miss Dumbum ain't your teacher today, I am, and I got a headache and the runs, so I say-- time for recess."
00:13:21.217,00:13:25.221,"But Mr. S., that poster charts everyone's performance."
00:13:25.263,00:13:28.600,We get gold stars when we master the material covered in class.
00:13:28.642,00:13:31.561,How do we get gold stars if we just have recess?
00:13:31.603,00:13:33.730,What are these black dots here?
00:13:33.772,00:13:36.274,Demerits.
00:13:39.026,00:13:42.322,What kind of a sick school is this?
00:13:42.363,00:13:44.407,Hmm?
00:13:48.035,00:13:50.413,Yeah?
00:13:53.040,00:13:58.463,"As long as I'm here, there will be no grades or gold stars or demerits."
00:13:58.505,00:14:00.881,We're going to have recess all the time.
00:14:00.923,00:14:02.509,Whoo!
00:14:00.923,00:14:04.552,"But, Ms. Dunham only gives us recess for 15 minutes."
00:14:04.594,00:14:08.222,"Hey! You're not hearing me, girl. I'm in charge now."
00:14:08.264,00:14:09.641,Okay?
00:14:09.683,00:14:12.226,And I say recess.
00:14:12.268,00:14:13.186,Go.
00:14:13.227,00:14:15.772,Play and have fun now.
00:14:15.814,00:14:17.565,Nice.
00:14:18.650,00:14:22.028,"Now you don't want me to have to call your parents, do you?"
00:14:22.069,00:14:24.155,"It's all right, Emily, don't cry."
00:14:24.197,00:14:27.659,Just try to be a bit more conscientious.
00:14:27.701,00:14:29.619,Would you like a hug?
00:14:31.120,00:14:34.957,"I'll be good, I swear!"
00:14:34.999,00:14:37.502,"All right, well, that's fine, Emily."
00:14:37.544,00:14:39.212,You're excused.
00:14:52.975,00:14:54.060,"Yes, we did it."
00:14:54.101,00:14:55.102,"We did it, come on."
00:14:55.144,00:14:56.479,Give me some.
00:14:56.521,00:14:58.439,Give me some.
00:14:58.481,00:14:59.566,Yeah! Woo-hoo!
00:14:59.607,00:15:01.942,I will see you cats on the flip flop.
00:15:01.984,00:15:03.862,Later!
00:15:03.903,00:15:05.488,I heard she slipped in the bathroom?
00:15:05.530,00:15:10.993,"MULLINS: Yes, yes, but we've got, of course, a wonderful new substitute who comes very highly recommended."
00:15:12.453,00:15:13.538,Mr. Schneebly?
00:15:13.580,00:15:14.247,Yeah!
00:15:14.288,00:15:15.832,Mr. Schneebly?
00:15:15.874,00:15:18.543,"Hold on, buddy!"
00:15:24.799,00:15:25.966,"Oh, my God."
00:15:26.008,00:15:27.176,You've got to be kidding me.
00:15:27.218,00:15:30.221,"Oh, man, this guy sucks,man."
00:15:30.263,00:15:32.265,You've gotta call him.
00:15:32.306,00:15:35.101,Call him? Yeah right.
00:15:44.652,00:15:46.028,Okay.
00:15:46.070,00:15:47.488,"Yes, you can be in my band."
00:15:47.530,00:15:49.365,"But, Ned..."
00:15:49.407,00:15:52.993,"I've got vision up the butt, so just go with it."
00:15:53.035,00:15:54.871,No thanks.
00:15:54.913,00:15:56.915,"You're not a teacher, Ned."
00:15:56.956,00:16:01.043,"You're the cross-dressing, blood-sucking incubus from Maggot Death."
00:16:01.085,00:16:02.837,That's the real you.
00:16:02.879,00:16:05.131,"Dewey, I'm not a satanic sex-god anymore."
00:16:05.172,00:16:08.301,I'm a working stiff and that's cool.
00:16:08.342,00:16:09.510,"She's got you brainwashed, man."
00:16:09.552,00:16:11.304,Can you see that I'm working?
00:16:11.345,00:16:12.764,That's terrific.
00:16:12.806,00:16:13.765,"But who are you, babe?"
00:16:13.807,00:16:15.308,"This is my apartment, babe."
00:16:15.349,00:16:18.519,"Oh... Not if you don't pay your rent, it's not."
00:16:18.561,00:16:19.562,Get a job.
00:16:19.604,00:16:20.939,"I got a job, okay?"
00:16:20.980,00:16:22.565,I am going to have your rent by the end of the week.
00:16:22.607,00:16:25.318,Go tell the mayor.
00:16:25.359,00:16:26.986,I do what Ned does; I'm temping.
00:16:27.027,00:16:29.280,I'm not a temp. I'm a sub.
00:16:29.322,00:16:31.324,And soon I'll be a certified teacher.
00:16:31.365,00:16:36.329,"Come on, man, one show, $20,000 prize-- we split it 60/40."
00:16:36.370,00:16:38.998,"Grab your bass and come back to the garage, brother."
00:16:39.039,00:16:41.417,"I mean, don't you miss rocking out?"
00:16:41.459,00:16:47.757,"Dewey, if you think anyone in their right mind is going to want to be in a band with you, you're more delusional than I thought."
00:16:47.799,00:16:51.594,"Dewey, you know, maybe it's time to give up those dreams."
00:16:51.636,00:16:56.098,"I did, and things are going really great for me."
00:17:12.156,00:17:17.203,Are you going to teach us anything or are we just going to sit here?
00:17:17.244,00:17:20.748,Just do whatever you want.
00:17:22.583,00:17:24.711,I want to learn from my teacher.
00:17:24.752,00:17:26.629,Besides that.
00:17:26.671,00:17:29.298,"Freddy, what do you like to do?"
00:17:29.340,00:17:31.718,"I don't know, burn stuff?"
00:17:31.759,00:17:35.722,Just go out and have recess.
00:17:35.763,00:17:42.353,"My parents don't spend $15,000 a year for recess."
00:17:42.395,00:17:43.980,"What, you want to learn something?"
00:17:44.022,00:17:45.356,"Yes, I do."
00:17:45.398,00:17:46.691,"What, you want me to teach you something?"
00:17:46.733,00:17:50.403,"You want to learn something? All right, here's a useful lesson for you."
00:17:50.444,00:17:52.572,Give up. Just quit.
00:17:52.613,00:17:56.743,"Because in this life, you can't win."
00:17:56.784,00:17:58.118,"Yeah, you can try."
00:17:58.160,00:18:03.416,"But in the end, you're just going to lose, big time, because the world is run by the man."
00:18:03.457,00:18:04.584,Who?
00:18:04.625,00:18:06.085,The man?
00:18:06.126,00:18:08.212,"Well, he's everywhere."
00:18:08.254,00:18:11.883,"In the White House, down the hall-- Miss Mullins, she's the man."
00:18:11.925,00:18:19.807,"And the man ruined the ozone, and he's burning down the Amazon, and he kidnapped Shamu and put her in a chlorine tank, okay?"
00:18:19.849,00:18:22.268,And there used to be a way to stick it to the man.
00:18:22.309,00:18:24.103,It was called Rock and Roll.
00:18:24.144,00:18:25.646,But guess what?
00:18:25.688,00:18:30.026,The man ruined that too with a little thing called MTV!
00:18:30.068,00:18:38.618,"So don't waste your time trying to make anything cool or pure or awesome, 'cause the man's just going to call you a fat, washed-up loser and crush your soul."
00:18:38.659,00:18:42.496,So do yourselves a favor and just give up!
00:18:45.499,00:18:46.793,Oh.
00:18:46.834,00:18:50.046,"Mr. Schneebly, it's after 10:00."
00:18:50.088,00:18:52.966,"On Tuesdays, the children have music class now."
00:18:53.007,00:18:54.133,DEWEY: Right. Okay.
00:18:54.174,00:18:55.760,"Uh... good work, people."
00:18:55.802,00:19:01.181,We will continue with our lecture on the man when we return.
00:19:01.223,00:19:03.309,Have a good music class.
00:20:40.781,00:20:43.784,"Mr. S., what's going on?"
00:20:45.369,00:20:48.164,I heard you in music class.
00:20:48.206,00:20:50.416,You guys can really play.
00:20:50.457,00:20:53.211,Why didn't anyone tell me?
00:20:53.252,00:20:54.336,You-- what's your name?
00:20:54.378,00:20:55.421,Zack.
00:20:55.462,00:20:56.463,You play the guitar?
00:20:56.505,00:20:58.966,Yeah.
00:21:01.219,00:21:02.929,You ever play the electric guitar?
00:21:02.970,00:21:04.263,My dad won't let me.
00:21:04.304,00:21:06.057,He thinks it's a waste of time.
00:21:06.099,00:21:09.102,A waste of...?
00:21:09.143,00:21:12.230,Try this one.
00:21:12.271,00:21:14.356,"Okay, here's a guitar pick."
00:21:14.398,00:21:17.985,"You pluck along with me, okay, if you can."
00:21:46.055,00:21:47.598,Yes.
00:22:02.362,00:22:04.448,Yes!
00:22:05.783,00:22:08.744,"Okay, you stay right there. Don't move."
00:22:08.786,00:22:09.620,Piano man?
00:22:09.662,00:22:10.997,Front and center.
00:22:11.038,00:22:11.998,Okay.
00:22:12.039,00:22:13.916,What's your name?
00:22:13.958,00:22:15.918,"Lawrence, you ever played keyboards?"
00:22:15.960,00:22:17.461,Any techno?
00:22:17.503,00:22:19.130,"No, I only play piano."
00:22:19.172,00:22:20.631,"Okay. All right, fair enough."
00:22:20.673,00:22:22.091,"Try this out for me, okay?"
00:22:22.133,00:22:24.718,"Just give this a try on my count, all right?"
00:22:24.760,00:22:26.470,One... two...
00:22:29.765,00:22:31.142,Yes.
00:22:49.952,00:22:51.620,Stop. That's perfect.
00:22:51.662,00:22:53.539,Stay right there.
00:22:53.580,00:22:57.210,You.
00:22:57.251,00:22:58.544,What was your name?
00:22:58.585,00:23:01.297,"Katie. What was that thing you were playing today, the big thing?"
00:23:01.339,00:23:02.464,Cello.
00:23:02.506,00:23:10.388,"Okay, this is a bass guitar, and it's the exact same thing, but instead of playing like this, you tip it on the side, chello,you've got a bass."
00:23:10.430,00:23:11.891,Try it on.
00:23:11.932,00:23:15.895,"Okay, now play this note right here, that's a G."
00:23:15.936,00:23:18.522,Okay.
00:23:18.564,00:23:19.982,But let your fingers do the rocking.
00:23:20.024,00:23:21.775,Keep that G coming all day long.
00:23:21.817,00:23:23.527,"G, G, G, G, G, G..."
00:23:23.569,00:23:24.862,Good. Stop.
00:23:24.904,00:23:27.323,Are there any drummers in the house?
00:23:27.365,00:23:29.116,I play percussion.
00:23:29.158,00:23:31.244,That's because you couldn't play anything else.
00:23:31.285,00:23:32.578,Shut up.
00:23:32.619,00:23:34.663,"Come here, dude."
00:23:37.583,00:23:39.377,"Just see if you can do what I do, okay?"
00:23:39.417,00:23:41.837,Just give it a try.
00:23:44.464,00:23:47.509,Okay? Give that a try.
00:23:52.472,00:23:54.183,Okay!
00:23:54.225,00:23:55.184,That's really good.
00:23:55.226,00:23:57.270,Just stay right here.
00:23:57.311,00:23:59.479,"All right, okay."
00:23:59.521,00:24:02.233,"Lawrence, give me a G note."
00:24:03.525,00:24:06.820,"With the fifth above it, and the middle one."
00:24:06.862,00:24:08.364,"No middle one, I changed my mind."
00:24:08.406,00:24:10.283,Now go an octave below.
00:24:10.324,00:24:11.409,Now give me some rhythm.
00:24:11.449,00:24:12.450,"Buh, buh, buh..."
00:24:12.492,00:24:14.036,And keep that same rhythm-- go.
00:24:14.078,00:24:17.539,"Okay, Katie, remember that note I taught you, the G?"
00:24:17.581,00:24:20.500,"Play it, but also keep it rocking, good."
00:24:20.542,00:24:22.711,"Bum, bum..."
00:24:22.753,00:24:26.548,"like a chung chigga, chung chigga, chung chigga, chung chigga, chung chigga, chung chigga..."
00:24:26.590,00:24:27.925,"Good. Okay, no, that's bad."
00:24:27.967,00:24:29.302,That's like George of the Jungle.
00:24:29.343,00:24:31.762,Play it up here on the cymbal but really light.
00:24:31.804,00:24:33.347,"Chung chigga, chung chigga..."
00:24:33.389,00:24:35.808,"Oh, that's it! Okay, keep going with that, Zack."
00:24:35.849,00:24:37.643,You remember this thing I taught you a minute ago?
00:24:37.684,00:24:38.894,It goes like...
00:24:42.231,00:24:43.983,Yes. Yes.
00:24:44.024,00:24:45.525,Whoa!
00:24:45.567,00:24:46.610,"All right, let's go!"
00:24:53.617,00:24:55.493,Oh!
00:24:55.535,00:24:56.745,You guys.
00:24:56.787,00:24:58.038,"Hey, you guys, stop messing around."
00:24:58.080,00:24:59.332,We've got a lot of work to do.
00:24:59.373,00:25:04.003,"Okay, people, pay attention because I do not want to have to fail you."
00:25:04.044,00:25:06.630,I thought you didn't believe in grades.
00:25:06.672,00:25:08.674,Of course I believe in grades.
00:25:08.715,00:25:10.426,I was testing you and you passed.
00:25:10.468,00:25:11.593,"Good work, Summer."
00:25:11.635,00:25:14.430,Four-and-a-half gold stars for you.
00:25:14.472,00:25:15.931,"Now, listen, you guys, you know what?"
00:25:15.973,00:25:20.518,"Normal kids would have been stoked to slack off, but not you guys, 'cause you're not normal."
00:25:20.560,00:25:22.021,You're special.
00:25:22.062,00:25:28.027,"And because I think you guys have the right attitude, I think it's time we started our new class project."
00:25:28.068,00:25:29.195,A science project?
00:25:29.236,00:25:30.404,No.
00:25:30.446,00:25:33.573,It's called... Rock Band.
00:25:33.615,00:25:36.534,Is this a school project?
00:25:36.576,00:25:38.037,And it's a requirement.
00:25:38.078,00:25:41.499,And it may sound easy...
00:25:41.539,00:25:46.753,"It will test your head and your mind and your brain, too."
00:25:46.795,00:25:48.839,Will other schools be competing?
00:25:48.881,00:25:50.257,You could say that.
00:25:50.299,00:25:56.722,You could say that every school in the state will be competing for the top prize.
00:25:56.763,00:25:58.265,What's the prize?
00:25:58.307,00:26:01.227,A win will go on your permanent record.
00:26:01.268,00:26:03.854,"Hello, Harvard, yo?"
00:26:03.896,00:26:11.904,"The thing is, we're not supposed to get started until next quarter, but I think we should get a leg up on the competition, don't you?"
00:26:11.945,00:26:13.072,I do.
00:26:13.113,00:26:14.740,Who else wants to go for the gold?
00:26:14.781,00:26:16.075,I do.
00:26:16.116,00:26:17.410,All right.
00:26:17.451,00:26:21.080,"But if anyone finds out what we're doing in here, we'll be disqualified."
00:26:21.121,00:26:23.290,"So let's just keep it on the down-low, shall we?"
00:26:23.332,00:26:24.208,Can we tell our parents?
00:26:24.250,00:26:25.792,No! Just trust me.
00:26:25.834,00:26:27.420,They don't want to know anything about this.
00:26:27.461,00:26:28.421,Keep it zipped.
00:26:28.462,00:26:32.674,"All right, you guys, let's kick it into overdrive."
00:26:32.716,00:26:34.093,What are the rest of us supposed to do?
00:26:34.134,00:26:37.763,You just sit back and enjoy the magic of rock.
00:26:37.804,00:26:41.392,"You mean, we're not in the band?"
00:26:42.351,00:26:43.477,"Now, hold up now."
00:26:43.519,00:26:48.732,Just 'cause you're not in the band doesn't mean you're not in the band.
00:26:48.774,00:26:51.235,We need backup singers.
00:26:53.279,00:26:54.280,"You, sing."
00:26:54.321,00:26:56.614,Yes.
00:27:01.703,00:27:02.788,Stop.
00:27:02.829,00:27:06.125,"You've got it, and I don't even know what it is, but you've got it."
00:27:06.166,00:27:08.252,And that's why you're in the band.
00:27:08.294,00:27:09.795,"You, sing."
00:27:19.972,00:27:24.518,"Stop, before I start crying because I found the missing ingredient."
00:27:24.560,00:27:25.727,You're in the band.
00:27:25.769,00:27:26.853,I can sing.
00:27:26.895,00:27:28.397,You can?
00:27:28.439,00:27:29.523,"All right, Summer, belt it."
00:27:34.694,00:27:36.654,Stop. Stop. Okay.
00:27:36.696,00:27:37.823,Good. That's pretty good.
00:27:37.864,00:27:39.366,All right.
00:27:39.408,00:27:41.160,"I can also play clarinet, you know."
00:27:41.201,00:27:42.453,I'll find something for you.
00:27:42.495,00:27:48.208,"When we get back from lunch, I'll assign the rest of you killer positions."
00:27:51.669,00:27:52.796,Thank you.
00:27:52.838,00:27:54.798,WOMAN: You're welcome.
00:27:54.840,00:27:56.008,There you go.
00:27:56.049,00:27:58.469,You're welcome.
00:28:06.810,00:28:08.854,Mr. Schneebly?
00:28:08.895,00:28:10.189,"Hey, what's up?"
00:28:10.230,00:28:12.858,I don't think I should be in the band.
00:28:12.899,00:28:13.859,Why not?
00:28:13.900,00:28:15.068,I'm not cool enough.
00:28:15.110,00:28:16.487,People in bands are cool.
00:28:16.529,00:28:17.695,I'm not cool.
00:28:17.737,00:28:19.031,"Dude, you are cool."
00:28:19.072,00:28:20.366,The way you play.
00:28:20.407,00:28:22.576,Wh... why do you say you're not cool?
00:28:22.618,00:28:25.829,Nobody ever talks to me.
00:28:25.871,00:28:36.507,"Well, those days are over, buddy, 'cause you could be the ugliest sad sack on the planet, but if you're in a rocking band, you're the cat's pajamas, man, you're the bee's knees."
00:28:36.549,00:28:37.841,Bee's knees?
00:28:37.883,00:28:39.468,"Yeah, the bee's knees."
00:28:39.510,00:28:41.845,You're going to be the most popular guy in school. Trust me.
00:28:41.887,00:28:44.056,Okay. I'll do it.
00:28:44.097,00:28:46.766,"Now, listen, this is a big commitment now."
00:28:46.808,00:28:49.811,You don't just say yes if you're going to flake out later.
00:28:49.853,00:28:52.398,I won't.
00:28:52.439,00:28:56.694,Welcome to my world.
00:28:56.735,00:28:58.862,Boom.
00:28:58.904,00:29:00.113,Okay.
00:29:00.155,00:29:02.074,"Boom, a couple of these."
00:29:02.115,00:29:03.825,Okay.
00:29:03.867,00:29:06.453,"Let's rock, let's rock today."
00:29:06.495,00:29:07.787,Now do it to me.
00:29:07.829,00:29:08.997,"Let's rock, let's rock today."
00:29:09.039,00:29:10.416,That's good.
00:29:10.457,00:29:13.377,Slap it.
00:29:13.419,00:29:15.379,Shoot it. Kaboot it.
00:29:15.421,00:29:17.423,We're going to work on that some more later.
00:29:17.464,00:29:19.091,It's a very long shake.
00:29:19.132,00:29:22.886,Good knuckle crack.
00:29:30.977,00:29:33.731,Lead guitar...
00:29:33.772,00:29:34.898,Zack Attack.
00:29:34.940,00:29:37.109,Take a seat.
00:29:37.150,00:29:40.112,"On bass, Posh Spice."
00:29:40.153,00:29:43.073,"On keyboards, Mr. Cool."
00:29:43.115,00:29:46.285,"And on drums, Spazzy McGee."
00:29:46.326,00:29:52.832,"Okay, Blondie, Brace Face, you're singing backup."
00:29:52.874,00:29:56.128,"All right, Tough Guy, Shortstop..."
00:29:56.169,00:29:57.879,"Fancy Pants, get over here."
00:29:57.921,00:29:59.423,You guys are on security detail.
00:29:59.465,00:30:03.260,You're job is to make sure no one outside this room knows what we're doing in here.
00:30:03.302,00:30:05.345,The future of the band depends on you.
00:30:05.387,00:30:09.433,"Okay, your first mission: soundproofing this room."
00:30:09.475,00:30:11.143,Get on it.
00:30:11.184,00:30:13.853,Can I be the band's stylist instead?
00:30:13.895,00:30:15.355,"Of course you can, Fancy Pants."
00:30:15.397,00:30:16.440,Okay.
00:30:16.482,00:30:21.236,"Carrot Top, Roadrunner, Turkey Sub, we are going to have a lot of equipment."
00:30:21.278,00:30:27.326,"We're talking amps, electric guitars, maybe even lasers and smoke machines."
00:30:27.367,00:30:32.581,"Now, your job is to master the transportation and operation of this technology."
00:30:32.623,00:30:38.504,"Seriously, without a first-rate roadie crew, we'll never have a psychedelic show, and I can't live with that, okay?"
00:30:38.545,00:30:41.923,I'm counting on you.
00:30:41.965,00:30:44.593,All right.
00:30:44.635,00:30:46.679,You three...
00:30:46.720,00:30:52.476,"groupies, and your job is simple: just worship the band."
00:30:52.518,00:30:57.189,And you're going to be making hats; you're going to be making T-shirts-- all kind of merchandise.
00:30:57.230,00:31:01.527,Which leads me to your first assignment: naming the band.
00:31:01.568,00:31:03.529,Yes.
00:31:03.570,00:31:05.030,Sit down.
00:31:05.071,00:31:11.203,"As for me, I will be singing lead vocal and shredding guitar."
00:31:11.244,00:31:14.832,Wait. Isn't this a student project?
00:31:14.873,00:31:15.915,What's your point?
00:31:15.957,00:31:18.377,Are you supposed to be in the band?
00:31:18.418,00:31:20.920,"What, you want to get rid of me?"
00:31:20.962,00:31:22.464,"Why, because I'm old?"
00:31:22.506,00:31:25.217,"You hate teachers, is that what you're about?"
00:31:25.258,00:31:26.259,No.
00:31:26.301,00:31:28.053,"Okay, well, teachers like to play, too."
00:31:28.094,00:31:35.686,"And not only am I going to play, I'm El Capitano, and what I say goes, so put your hands over your hearts."
00:31:37.103,00:31:57.708,"I pledge allegiance ALL: I pledge allegiance to the band ALL: to the band of Mr. Schneebly, ALL: of Mr. Schneebly, and will not fight him ALL: and will not fight him for creative control, ALL: for creative control, and will defer to him on all issues related to the musical direction of the band."
00:31:57.750,00:32:00.085,ALL: And will defer to him on all issues...
00:32:03.296,00:32:06.132,Let's get rocking!
00:32:06.174,00:32:08.761,ALL: Yeah!
00:32:22.982,00:32:24.401,"Morning, Summer."
00:32:24.443,00:32:25.861,Groupie?
00:32:25.903,00:32:27.446,What's the matter?
00:32:27.487,00:32:29.448,You want me to be a groupie?
00:32:29.489,00:32:31.116,"Well, groupie is an important job."
00:32:31.157,00:32:33.452,I researched groupies on the Internet.
00:32:33.493,00:32:35.454,They're sluts; they sleep with the band.
00:32:35.495,00:32:38.998,No. That's not true.
00:32:39.040,00:32:40.959,I don't want to be a cheerleader.
00:32:41.000,00:32:45.798,"Look, my mother is a room parent and she's not going to be happy when she hears about this."
00:32:45.839,00:32:47.257,"Okay, listen."
00:32:47.299,00:32:52.387,"I didn't want to say this in front of the other kids 'cause I didn't want to make them jealous, but I made a special position just for you."
00:32:52.429,00:32:56.725,And it's the most important job of all: band manager.
00:32:56.767,00:32:59.144,Band manager?
00:32:59.185,00:33:00.479,What's that?
00:33:00.520,00:33:06.192,"Well, I'm going to be busy rocking out, so it's up to you to make sure everyone is doing their job."
00:33:06.234,00:33:08.612,Summer... you're in charge of everything.
00:33:08.654,00:33:10.739,Okay.
00:33:10.781,00:33:12.866,Okay.
00:33:12.908,00:33:16.161,All right. Look alive!
00:33:16.202,00:33:17.496,Listen up.
00:33:17.537,00:33:20.373,"First thing you do, when you start a band..."
00:33:20.415,00:33:25.170,"Um, Mr. Schneebly, before we start, shouldn't I first take attendance?"
00:33:25.211,00:33:28.340,"Okay, fine."
00:33:30.717,00:33:32.511,Okay.
00:33:32.552,00:33:33.846,Now...
00:33:33.887,00:33:34.930,Michelle?
00:33:34.972,00:33:36.598,Here.
00:33:36.640,00:33:37.724,And Marco.
00:33:37.766,00:33:38.976,Here.
00:33:39.017,00:33:41.394,"Uh, Summer. Here."
00:33:41.436,00:33:42.437,"Uh, let's see. Tomika?"
00:33:42.479,00:33:44.105,"Okay, we're all here."
00:33:44.147,00:33:50.362,"Look, the first thing you do when you start a band is talk about your influences."
00:33:50.403,00:33:53.072,That's how you figure out what kind of band you want to be.
00:33:53.114,00:33:55.200,"So, who do you like?"
00:33:55.241,00:33:57.786,Blondie?
00:33:57.828,00:34:00.998,Who? No. Come on. What?
00:34:01.039,00:34:02.541,"You, Shortstop."
00:34:02.582,00:34:03.709,Puff Daddy.
00:34:03.750,00:34:05.627,Wrong. Billy?
00:34:05.669,00:34:07.086,Liza Minelli?
00:34:07.128,00:34:09.464,What are you...?
00:34:09.506,00:34:12.133,This project is called Rock Band.
00:34:12.175,00:34:15.220,I'm talking about bands that rock.
00:34:15.261,00:34:18.223,Led Zeppelin.
00:34:21.100,00:34:25.313,Don't tell me you guys have never gotten the Led out.
00:34:25.355,00:34:27.649,Jimmy Page? Robert Plant?
00:34:27.691,00:34:29.735,Ring any bells?
00:34:29.776,00:34:32.487,What about Sabbath?
00:34:32.529,00:34:33.739,AC/DC?
00:34:33.780,00:34:35.574,Motorhead?
00:34:35.615,00:34:38.410,"Oh, what do they teach in this place?!"
00:34:38.451,00:34:40.412,Summer...
00:34:40.453,00:34:43.122,"you're the class whatever, go to the board."
00:34:43.164,00:34:45.250,Factotum.
00:34:45.291,00:34:47.711,Factotor.
00:34:47.753,00:34:48.962,New schedule.
00:34:49.004,00:34:52.215,"8:15 to 10:00, Rock History."
00:34:52.257,00:34:57.804,"10:00 to 11:00, Rock Appreciation and Theory."
00:34:57.846,00:35:00.139,And then band practice until the end of the day.
00:35:00.181,00:35:03.060,What about math?
00:35:03.101,00:35:04.603,World cultures?
00:35:04.644,00:35:07.272,"You guys, we need to focus here."
00:35:07.313,00:35:08.273,Don't you want to win this contest?
00:35:08.314,00:35:09.691,It's prestigious.
00:35:09.733,00:35:11.568,"Um, question."
00:35:11.610,00:35:14.362,How are we being graded in all this?
00:35:14.404,00:35:19.534,"I mean, since I'm band manager and I have the most responsibility, wouldn't...?"
00:35:19.576,00:35:24.039,"Summer, if you grade-grub one more time, I will send you back to the first grade, you got it?"
00:35:24.081,00:35:25.791,Back to your seat now.
00:35:25.832,00:35:27.793,Fine.
00:35:27.834,00:35:29.002,What are we going to play?
00:35:29.044,00:35:31.755,"Uh, you don't have to worry about that."
00:35:31.797,00:35:34.674,"We have awesome material, which I wrote."
00:35:34.716,00:35:36.969,Let's hear it.
00:35:37.010,00:35:38.177,What?
00:35:38.219,00:35:40.472,Let's hear your song.
00:35:40.513,00:35:42.682,You want to hear my song?
00:35:42.724,00:35:44.893,"I'll play you my song, if you want to hear it."
00:35:44.935,00:35:53.944,"The thing is, I just want you to keep in mind, I wrote it in, like, 15 minutes and, uh, it's not done yet, and you might not like it..."
00:35:53.986,00:35:55.612,"Just play the song, Schneebly."
00:35:55.654,00:35:59.825,"Okay, I will sing it for you, but, uh, let me just get in the zone."
00:35:59.866,00:36:04.203,"I was not planning on unveiling it, but I will sing it."
00:36:06.706,00:36:09.501,"Tip of the tongue, teeth and the lips."
00:36:14.255,00:36:15.882,Okay.
00:36:15.924,00:36:17.676,It starts off...
00:36:17.717,00:36:24.641,a dark stage and then a beam of light and you can see me and my guitar.
00:36:39.781,00:36:43.994,And then a thin layer of fog comes in around my ankles.
00:36:44.036,00:36:45.662,"Roadies, that means dry ice."
00:36:45.704,00:36:48.040,We gonna talk about this later.
00:36:58.967,00:37:01.011,"Chimes, Freddy."
00:37:12.271,00:37:14.900,"Then, Katie, you come in with the bass."
00:37:27.620,00:37:30.582,"And then, Zack, you come in with a face-melter."
00:37:33.126,00:37:34.586,Okay?
00:37:45.055,00:37:47.182,"And then, shh...Hawaii Five-O."
00:37:47.224,00:37:48.767,You ever see that show?
00:37:48.808,00:37:50.602,"Okay, well, there's a drum solo in it that goes..."
00:37:50.643,00:37:52.270,"Shiga jigga, jigga, jigga, jigga."
00:37:55.941,00:38:12.415,"And then, that's where I want the backup singers to be, like, Boom! Big ol' explosion."
00:38:12.457,00:38:14.918,"Some, like, confetti comes down."
00:38:14.960,00:38:17.670,"Anyway, that's all I got so far-- It's a work in progress."
00:38:17.712,00:38:21.466,"I liked it, Mr. Schneebly."
00:38:21.507,00:38:25.053,Thank you.
00:38:25.095,00:38:26.679,Mr. S.?
00:38:26.721,00:38:28.140,We came up with some names for the band.
00:38:28.181,00:38:30.142,Yeah? Hit me.
00:38:30.183,00:38:32.144,"Uh... No, it's sissy."
00:38:32.185,00:38:33.645,The Koala Bears?
00:38:33.686,00:38:35.688,No. What are you talking about?
00:38:35.730,00:38:37.774,"Okay, girls, I need to speak with Principal Mullins."
00:38:37.816,00:38:39.943,"Hey, Miss Mullins. Hello."
00:38:39.985,00:38:42.154,How's it going?
00:38:42.195,00:38:43.488,Sh...
00:38:43.529,00:38:45.282,It's a science project. Never mind.
00:38:45.323,00:38:50.162,"Listen, Ros, I was thinking about organizing a field trip for the kids at the end of the month."
00:38:50.203,00:38:52.122,What do you think about that?
00:38:52.164,00:38:55.667,"Well, um... substitutes, as a rule, do not organize field trips."
00:38:55.708,00:38:58.962,"Right, but I figure I'm going to be here for a while so..."
00:38:59.004,00:39:01.506,"Well, that remains to be seen."
00:39:01.547,00:39:03.591,Have you met some of our other teachers?
00:39:03.633,00:39:07.971,"No, but listen, don't you think the kids could learn by getting out of the classroom?"
00:39:08.013,00:39:10.182,"You know, it's more complicated than that, all right?"
00:39:10.223,00:39:11.641,There's safety issues.
00:39:11.683,00:39:13.810,"Parents need to be notified, all right?"
00:39:13.852,00:39:15.436,It's against school policy.
00:39:15.478,00:39:16.813,"Mr. S., I have a lot of ideas."
00:39:16.855,00:39:17.814,Hmm?
00:39:17.856,00:39:21.026,"How about, everyone in magenta with beads and sequins?"
00:39:21.067,00:39:25.113,"Billy, Billy, can't you see I'm talking to Principal Mullins?"
00:39:25.155,00:39:26.405,"Oh, hi."
00:39:26.447,00:39:28.241,I'll make up some samples.
00:39:28.283,00:39:29.617,Everyone?
00:39:29.659,00:39:31.410,This is Ned Schneebly.
00:39:31.452,00:39:32.745,He's covering for Gail.
00:39:32.787,00:39:34.413,This is Gabe Green.
00:39:34.455,00:39:35.707,Hello.
00:39:35.748,00:39:37.334,"Hey, there."
00:39:35.748,00:39:39.127,Bob's our PE teacher and Roberta is our librarian.
00:39:39.169,00:39:40.503,How do you do?
00:39:40.545,00:39:41.880,"Would you care to join us, Mr. Schneebly?"
00:39:41.921,00:39:44.090,Yeah.
00:39:44.132,00:39:45.800,Schneebly?
00:39:45.842,00:39:47.385,"Actually, it's Schnayblay."
00:39:47.426,00:39:49.095,We were just discussing testing.
00:39:49.137,00:39:50.388,Mm-hmm.
00:39:50.429,00:39:51.723,Which test do you find most effective?
00:39:51.764,00:39:52.849,The TASS or the Wilson-Binet?
00:39:52.891,00:39:57.270,"DEWEY: Mmm. I-I say no testing, and I will tell you why, Joe."
00:39:57.312,00:39:58.604,Gabe.
00:39:58.646,00:40:03.568,I believe that the children are the future.
00:40:03.609,00:40:07.864,"Now, listen, you can teach them well, but, buddy, you have got to let them lead the way."
00:40:07.906,00:40:12.994,Let the children's laughter just remind us how we used to be.
00:40:13.036,00:40:16.248,"That's what I decided, long ago."
00:40:16.289,00:40:18.917,Isn't that a song?
00:40:18.958,00:40:19.959,Hmm? No.
00:40:20.001,00:40:23.213,"No... Uh, I don't think so. No."
00:40:23.255,00:40:24.797,No?
00:40:24.839,00:40:26.091,Mm-mm.
00:40:52.367,00:40:53.952,Everybody...
00:41:05.755,00:41:08.425,All right.
00:41:08.466,00:41:10.009,"Okay, Freddy, that was awesome."
00:41:10.051,00:41:12.971,"You're rocking, but it's a little sloppy Joe."
00:41:13.012,00:41:14.806,"Tighten up the screws, okay?"
00:41:14.847,00:41:18.101,"Zack, dude, what's up with the stiffness man?"
00:41:18.143,00:41:22.021,You're looking...
00:41:22.063,00:41:28.069,"Let's, uh, grease up the hinges, and listen-- loosey-goosey, baby, loosey-goosey."
00:41:28.111,00:41:30.155,I'm just playing it the way you told me.
00:41:30.196,00:41:31.948,"I know, and you know what? It's perfect."
00:41:31.990,00:41:34.659,"But the thing is, rock is about the passion, man."
00:41:34.700,00:41:36.328,Where's the joy?
00:41:36.369,00:41:40.290,"You're the lead guitarist and we are counting on you for some style, brotha."
00:41:40.332,00:41:42.583,So try this out.
00:41:42.625,00:41:43.918,It's called power stance.
00:41:43.960,00:41:45.420,That's it. Power stance.
00:41:45.462,00:41:46.629,You own the universe.
00:41:46.671,00:41:48.340,Now give me an E chord.
00:41:48.381,00:41:49.841,Just go... Ugh!
00:41:49.882,00:41:51.509,"But let me hear, Ugh!"
00:41:51.550,00:41:52.844,Ugh!
00:41:52.885,00:41:55.096,"Yeah, now raise your goblet of rock."
00:41:55.138,00:41:57.515,It's a toast to those who rock.
00:41:57.556,00:42:03.396,Now smile and nod your head and let me see your eyeballs wide like there's something wrong. Yeah! Yeah.
00:42:03.438,00:42:05.815,Do it again. Give me that...
00:42:07.025,00:42:08.443,That's what I'm talking about.
00:42:08.485,00:42:12.197,"Okay, let's do it again from You're not hardcore."
00:42:12.238,00:42:13.198,"One, two, three..."
00:42:24.750,00:42:26.585,Yeah! Now we're rocking.
00:42:26.627,00:42:30.673,Your homework is to listen to some real music.
00:42:30.715,00:42:33.385,"For Blondie, Blondie."
00:42:33.426,00:42:35.178,"For Lawrence, Yes."
00:42:35.220,00:42:36.804,That's the name of the band.
00:42:36.846,00:42:38.806,Listen to the keyboard solo on Roundabout.
00:42:38.848,00:42:43.436,It will blow the classical music out your butt.
00:42:43.478,00:42:44.729,"Okay, for you, Rush."
00:42:44.770,00:42:46.647,2112. Neil Peart.
00:42:46.689,00:42:48.483,One of the great drummers of all time.
00:42:48.525,00:42:49.942,Study up.
00:42:49.984,00:42:52.611,"Um, are we going to be goofing off like this every day?"
00:42:52.653,00:42:54.697,"Uh, we're not goofing off."
00:42:54.739,00:42:56.199,We're creating musical fusion.
00:42:56.241,00:42:58.743,"Well, um, are we going to be creating musical fusion every day?"
00:42:58.784,00:43:01.620,Yeah. Get used to it.
00:43:01.662,00:43:04.541,"Okay, and for you, Jimi Hendrix."
00:43:04.582,00:43:05.875,Axis Bold As Love.
00:43:05.917,00:43:08.920,"Dude, are you psyched about the new project?"
00:43:08.961,00:43:10.588,Sure.
00:43:10.629,00:43:12.131,"Wait a minute. What's up, man?"
00:43:12.173,00:43:14.008,Are you the...?
00:43:12.173,00:43:15.343,You're the lead guitarist of an unbelievable rock band.
00:43:15.385,00:43:17.303,This is a dream come true for you.
00:43:17.345,00:43:19.097,Okay.
00:43:19.138,00:43:22.350,All right.
00:43:22.392,00:43:24.352,Mr. S.?
00:43:24.394,00:43:25.770,"Hey, Tomika, what's up?"
00:43:25.811,00:43:27.439,I don't want to be a roadie.
00:43:27.480,00:43:30.275,What? Why not?
00:43:30.316,00:43:32.777,All right. Well...
00:43:32.818,00:43:35.321,"You want to be, uh... Security?"
00:43:35.363,00:43:37.282,I want to be a singer.
00:43:37.323,00:43:39.075,A singer?
00:43:39.117,00:43:43.079,Okay. Sing me something.
00:43:44.789,00:43:47.833,"Tomica, I can't let you be a singer if you can't sing."
00:44:09.188,00:44:11.524,"Oh, my goodness."
00:44:11.566,00:44:12.733,"Nice pipes, Tomika."
00:44:12.775,00:44:17.280,Why didn't you raise your hand when I was looking for singers?
00:44:17.322,00:44:19.616,You're in.
00:44:19.657,00:44:20.992,"Oh, okay. Perfect."
00:44:21.033,00:44:22.743,"Pink Floyd, Dark Side of the Moon."
00:44:22.785,00:44:25.704,Listen to the vocal solo on The Great Gig in the Sky.
00:44:25.746,00:44:27.332,All right?
00:44:27.373,00:44:28.874,All right.
00:44:38.593,00:44:42.763,Off to work. Bye-bye.
00:44:52.607,00:44:57.028,"You can play your music after you finish your homework, after you finish your chores, but not until then."
00:44:57.069,00:45:02.783,"Zack! Zack, do not walk away from me when I'm talking to you."
00:45:02.825,00:45:04.285,All right? Last thing.
00:45:04.327,00:45:08.665,"You do your guitar after your homework and chores and only what Miss Schoncott gives you, all right?"
00:45:08.705,00:45:09.999,No more rock music. Okay?
00:45:10.041,00:45:11.959,ZACK: Okay.
00:45:12.001,00:45:14.711,Watch that attitude.
00:45:14.753,00:45:16.713,Do you have another blanket?
00:45:19.884,00:45:21.469,That's good.
00:45:28.351,00:45:29.519,All right.
00:45:29.561,00:45:32.021,"Everybody, class has begun."
00:45:32.063,00:45:33.356,And you know what?
00:45:33.398,00:45:40.988,"You guys have been doing real good in here, and if I was going to give you a grade, I would give you an A, but that's the problem."
00:45:41.030,00:45:42.448,Rock ain't about doing things perfect.
00:45:42.490,00:45:46.285,Who can tell me what it's really about?
00:45:46.327,00:45:48.371,Frankie?
00:45:48.413,00:45:50.498,Uh... Scoring chicks?
00:45:50.540,00:45:51.583,N-no.
00:45:51.624,00:45:52.917,See. No.
00:45:52.958,00:45:54.877,Eleni?
00:45:54.919,00:45:57.171,N... Come on. No.
00:45:57.213,00:45:59.424,Leonard.
00:45:59.465,00:46:02.260,"Yes! But you can't just say it, man."
00:46:02.301,00:46:04.095,You got to feel it in your blood and guts.
00:46:04.136,00:46:07.306,"If you want to rock, you gotta break the rules."
00:46:07.348,00:46:11.102,"You gotta get mad at the man, and right now I'm the man."
00:46:11.143,00:46:15.231,"That's right, I'm the man, and who's got the guts to tell me off? Huh?"
00:46:15.273,00:46:17.108,Who's going to tell me off?
00:46:17.149,00:46:18.901,"Shut the hell up, Schneebly!"
00:46:18.943,00:46:21.195,"That's it, Freddy."
00:46:21.237,00:46:23.072,That's it.
00:46:23.114,00:46:25.450,"Get out of here, stupid ass."
00:46:25.491,00:46:28.369,"DEWEY: Yes, Alicia."
00:46:28.411,00:46:29.454,You're a joke.
00:46:29.495,00:46:31.788,You're the worst teacher I've ever had.
00:46:31.830,00:46:33.207,Summer. That is great.
00:46:33.249,00:46:35.000,I like the delivery because I felt your anger.
00:46:35.042,00:46:36.294,Thank you.
00:46:36.335,00:46:39.547,You're a fat loser and you have body odor.
00:46:39.589,00:46:42.007,All right. All right.
00:46:42.049,00:46:44.093,Now is everyone nice and pissed off?
00:46:44.135,00:46:45.511,ALL: Yeah!
00:46:45.553,00:46:47.012,Time to write a rock song.
00:46:47.054,00:46:51.225,"Now, what makes you mad more than anything in the world?"
00:46:54.019,00:46:55.521,Billy?
00:46:55.563,00:46:57.315,"Billy, we've already told me off."
00:46:57.356,00:46:58.316,Let's move on.
00:46:58.357,00:46:59.942,You're tacky and I hate you.
00:46:59.984,00:47:02.695,"Okay, you see me after class."
00:47:02.737,00:47:03.988,You. Gordon.
00:47:04.029,00:47:05.573,No allowance.
00:47:11.912,00:47:13.665,You know what I mean?
00:47:13.706,00:47:14.791,What else makes you mad?
00:47:14.831,00:47:16.459,Michelle?
00:47:22.507,00:47:23.800,What else?
00:47:23.840,00:47:25.176,Bullies.
00:47:33.559,00:47:36.103,So what would you say to a bully? Zack?
00:47:36.145,00:47:37.605,I don't know.
00:47:37.647,00:47:38.815,"Now, come on."
00:47:38.855,00:47:41.359,"If someone was right up in your grill, what would you say?"
00:47:41.400,00:47:43.027,I don't know.
00:47:43.068,00:47:45.655,"If someone was pushing you around, telling you what to do, what would you say?"
00:47:45.697,00:47:47.072,Step off?
00:47:53.287,00:47:54.871,Everybody!
00:48:16.561,00:48:17.645,Am I right?
00:48:30.825,00:48:36.581,"All right, now that was a perfectly decent rock song."
00:48:40.959,00:48:43.755,Grazie. Grazie.
00:48:43.796,00:48:45.464,"Oh, yeah."
00:48:43.796,00:48:51.387,"I was this close to getting a chair on the Polish Philharmonic, and I nailed the audish, but I didn't get it."
00:48:51.429,00:48:52.597,Guess who did.
00:48:52.638,00:48:54.515,Yo-Yo Ma's cousin.
00:48:54.557,00:48:55.767,Little nepotis.
00:48:55.808,00:49:02.607,"But, anyway, I just decided to give up on myself and become a teacher, because those that can't do, teach."
00:49:02.648,00:49:06.778,"And those that can't teach, teach gym. Am I...?"
00:49:10.406,00:49:13.033,"Aw, I'm just..."
00:49:13.075,00:49:15.536,Cute.
00:49:15.578,00:49:17.246,"Hey, Mr. Schneebly."
00:49:17.288,00:49:20.625,"Just wanted to say, that was a really cool lesson today."
00:49:20.666,00:49:23.795,"Well, thanks, dude."
00:49:23.836,00:49:25.755,Okay.
00:51:39.555,00:51:43.559,"I'm just saying, name two great chick drummers."
00:51:43.601,00:51:44.602,Sheila E?
00:51:44.643,00:51:46.979,Meg White from the White Stripes?
00:51:47.021,00:51:48.146,She can't drum.
00:51:48.188,00:51:49.857,She's a better drummer than you.
00:51:49.899,00:51:51.191,At least she has rhythm.
00:51:51.233,00:51:52.985,"Freddy, where are your sleeves?"
00:51:53.027,00:51:55.738,And what have you done to your hair?
00:51:55.780,00:51:56.655,It's called punk.
00:51:56.697,00:51:59.867,"Well, it's not school uniform."
00:52:01.577,00:52:04.120,"Miss Mullins, you're the man."
00:52:04.162,00:52:05.831,"Thank you, Frankie."
00:52:13.047,00:52:14.632,"Good morning, everyone."
00:52:14.673,00:52:21.764,"Just a reminder: Parents' Night is coming up, and I do expect everyone to have a presentation."
00:52:21.806,00:52:25.225,What? Oh! Oh!
00:52:25.267,00:52:27.394,MAN: You okay?
00:52:27.436,00:52:31.315,"As you know, it is the most important event of the year."
00:52:31.356,00:52:38.405,"The parents will be scrutinizing our every move, so I find it's best to over-prepare. Right?"
00:52:38.447,00:52:41.617,The best defense is a good offense.
00:52:41.659,00:52:44.829,"And, um... Roberta, now that I see you..."
00:52:44.870,00:52:49.834,"Hey, is, uh..."
00:52:51.043,00:52:52.670,"Oh, yeah."
00:52:52.711,00:52:57.049,Except for the time she got drunk at the Alumni Dinner.
00:52:57.091,00:52:58.676,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh..."
00:52:58.717,00:53:00.469,You should have seen that.
00:53:00.511,00:53:05.181,She got up on the table and did a Stevie Nicks impersonation.
00:53:05.223,00:53:06.809,And she wasn't bad.
00:53:06.851,00:53:11.063,"Remember, she took up the tablecloth and whirled around with it?"
00:53:11.105,00:53:16.902,"...that had been on the turkey tray, that touched over onto the peanut butter and jelly tray."
00:53:16.944,00:53:21.406,"Now, I... I know that you know that this is a severe problem."
00:53:27.287,00:53:29.373,Clear.
00:53:29.414,00:53:32.459,"Go, go, go!"
00:53:45.764,00:53:48.726,"All right, you guys, is everybody ready?"
00:53:48.767,00:53:49.685,Yeah.
00:53:49.727,00:53:53.022,Strap in.
00:53:59.987,00:54:03.991,"Oh, dude, cool."
00:54:11.540,00:54:16.003,Three worms.
00:54:17.546,00:54:22.258,"DEWEY: In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean...?"
00:54:22.300,00:54:24.178,Blue.
00:54:24.220,00:54:26.638,DEWEY: Blue. That's right. Okay.
00:54:26.680,00:54:33.104,"Now, Columbus had three boats-- the Nina, the...?"
00:54:33.145,00:54:34.396,Gordon?
00:54:34.438,00:54:37.108,Pinta. That's right. And...?
00:54:37.149,00:54:39.401,Marco?
00:54:39.443,00:54:40.569,Santa Marina?
00:54:40.611,00:54:42.780,The Santa Marina. That's good.
00:54:42.821,00:54:45.532,"Actually, it's the Santa Maria."
00:54:45.574,00:54:46.742,Okay. Now you got...
00:54:46.784,00:54:48.202,"Listen. Pay attention, kids."
00:54:48.244,00:54:52.039,I'm not afraid to flunk every...
00:54:52.081,00:54:53.582,"What's up, dude?"
00:54:53.624,00:54:56.210,"Whoa! Check out these little kids, man."
00:54:56.252,00:54:57.920,"Hey, shut up."
00:54:57.962,00:55:02.258,"Thought this was the Battle of The Bands, not the, uh..."
00:55:02.298,00:55:03.299,"Hey, you want a piece of me?"
00:55:03.341,00:55:04.509,"Hey, look at this guy."
00:55:04.551,00:55:06.302,Freddy? Freddy!
00:55:06.344,00:55:07.763,"We've got to focus up, you guys."
00:55:07.805,00:55:09.890,We got to nail this audition.
00:55:09.932,00:55:12.143,Mr. S?
00:55:12.184,00:55:13.309,What's up?
00:55:13.351,00:55:16.480,I don't think I can sing.
00:55:16.521,00:55:18.690,What are you talking about?
00:55:18.732,00:55:21.110,Come here.
00:55:22.987,00:55:24.989,"So, Tomika, what's going on?"
00:55:25.030,00:55:27.574,"What do you mean, you can't sing?"
00:55:27.616,00:55:30.286,I don't feel good.
00:55:30.326,00:55:32.496,Just let Alicia and Marta do it.
00:55:32.537,00:55:36.292,No. They can't sing like you can. I need you in the chorus.
00:55:36.332,00:55:38.669,What is it? Are you nervous?
00:55:38.710,00:55:40.671,Yeah? Why?
00:55:40.712,00:55:43.548,They're gonna laugh at me.
00:55:43.590,00:55:45.759,What? Why would they laugh at you?
00:55:45.801,00:55:49.180,I don't know. 'Cause I'm fat?
00:55:52.808,00:55:55.311,"Hey, you've got something everybody wants."
00:55:55.351,00:55:56.895,"You've got talent, girl."
00:55:56.937,00:56:00.398,"You have an incredible singing voice, and I'm not just saying that."
00:56:00.440,00:56:02.358,"You heard of Aretha Franklin, right?"
00:56:02.400,00:56:04.360,"Okay, she's a big lady."
00:56:04.402,00:56:07.698,"But when she starts singing, she blows people's minds."
00:56:07.739,00:56:09.992,Everybody wants to party with Aretha!
00:56:10.034,00:56:11.243,"And, uh..."
00:56:10.034,00:56:13.078,you know who else has a weight issue?
00:56:13.120,00:56:14.370,Who?
00:56:14.412,00:56:21.045,"Me. But once I get up onstage, start doing my thing, people worship me."
00:56:21.086,00:56:24.798,Because I'm sexy...
00:56:24.840,00:56:26.842,Why aren't you on a diet?
00:56:26.884,00:56:29.887,Because I like to eat.
00:56:29.928,00:56:32.681,"Look, you know what?"
00:56:32.723,00:56:34.892,"The thing is, you're a rock star now."
00:56:34.933,00:56:37.936,"All you got to do is you just got to go out there, just rock your heart out."
00:56:37.978,00:56:39.855,"People are going to dig you, I swear."
00:56:39.897,00:56:41.565,"Let's just go out there, show them what you got."
00:56:41.606,00:56:43.192,What do you say?
00:56:43.234,00:56:45.736,Okay.
00:56:46.904,00:56:49.073,Thank you.
00:56:49.114,00:56:51.158,Let's rock.
00:56:51.200,00:56:53.911,Okay. We are good to go.
00:56:53.952,00:56:56.080,"No, we're not. Freddy took off."
00:56:56.121,00:56:57.164,What? Where?
00:56:57.206,00:56:58.749,Some guys invited him out to their van.
00:56:58.790,00:57:02.836,"What?! Come on, you guys!"
00:57:04.338,00:57:09.968,"Freddy? Hey, have you seen a little kid, like, yea high?"
00:57:10.010,00:57:11.678,Huh? Dang it.
00:57:11.720,00:57:15.266,"Freddy, this is your teacher talking!"
00:57:15.307,00:57:16.808,"Hey, Mr. S."
00:57:16.850,00:57:19.019,"Oh, man!"
00:57:20.312,00:57:21.646,What's going on here?
00:57:21.688,00:57:23.107,Nothing.
00:57:23.148,00:57:26.568,"Freddy Jones, you get out of that van this instant."
00:57:26.610,00:57:29.738,See you guys.
00:57:29.780,00:57:34.118,"Hey, man, you think you're pretty funny, partying with an innocent little kid?"
00:57:34.159,00:57:36.494,"Dude, we're..."
00:57:36.536,00:57:38.038,"That kid's ten years old, man."
00:57:38.080,00:57:44.920,"He looks up to you, and you are setting an example for him, so quit messing around, and start acting like a responsible adult!"
00:57:44.962,00:57:46.630,That goes for all of you guys.
00:57:46.671,00:57:48.548,Don't make me come back here.
00:57:50.759,00:57:52.219,Come on. Let's go.
00:57:52.261,00:57:53.511,What's the big deal?
00:57:53.553,00:57:55.555,You're acting like my mom.
00:57:55.597,00:57:56.640,What's the big deal?
00:57:56.681,00:57:58.309,"You had me worried sick, man."
00:57:58.350,00:58:00.644,I was just hanging out with some real rockers.
00:58:00.685,00:58:02.062,You listen to me.
00:58:02.104,00:58:03.814,Those aren't real rockers; they're posers.
00:58:03.855,00:58:06.066,Rock ain't about getting loaded and acting like a jerk.
00:58:06.108,00:58:08.735,"Now, this is serious business here, man."
00:58:08.777,00:58:10.570,We got a mission.
00:58:10.612,00:58:13.991,Putting on a great show is the most important thing you can do.
00:58:14.032,00:58:16.493,One great rock show can change the world.
00:58:16.534,00:58:19.663,Do you understand me?
00:58:19.704,00:58:23.083,"And if you ever scare me like that again, so help me, I will..."
00:58:23.125,00:58:25.752,I will send a note home to your parents. Let's go.
00:58:25.794,00:58:30.757,"All right, you guys, just wait here for a minute."
00:58:30.799,00:58:33.260,"Hey, man, look at this stage."
00:58:33.302,00:58:34.470,Yeah. It's cool.
00:58:34.511,00:58:35.679,"DEWEY: Hey, what's going on?"
00:58:35.720,00:58:37.181,Where is everyone?
00:58:37.222,00:58:40.725,Uh... auditions are over.
00:58:40.767,00:58:42.060,"Listen, you can't leave."
00:58:42.102,00:58:43.687,You haven't heard our band.
00:58:43.728,00:58:45.522,Sorry. The bill is full.
00:58:45.563,00:58:48.317,"No, no, no. Let us just play one song. We're all here."
00:58:48.359,00:58:49.526,We're ready to go.
00:58:49.567,00:58:50.735,Who are they?
00:58:50.777,00:58:52.196,Kids? What is this?
00:58:52.237,00:58:54.072,Some kind of gimmick?
00:58:54.114,00:58:56.492,"I know they're kids, but they're awesome. Just listen."
00:58:56.533,00:58:59.703,"Look, thanks for coming down, but you're really not what we're looking for."
00:58:59.744,00:59:02.206,You listen to me!
00:58:59.744,00:59:07.544,"These kids have worked their little fingers to the bone just to play one song for you, so you just sit down, shut up, and listen!"
00:59:07.585,00:59:11.965,Sheila... call Security.
00:59:13.550,00:59:16.220,"Oh, God."
00:59:16.261,00:59:18.805,"SUMMER: Look, it was just a warm-up gig."
00:59:18.847,00:59:21.892,We'll still be able to compete against the other schools next quarter.
00:59:21.933,00:59:23.394,What are you talking about?
00:59:23.435,00:59:25.396,"This is the gig, Summer."
00:59:25.437,00:59:27.314,Then we shouldn't take no for an answer.
00:59:27.356,00:59:29.024,What...? Don't take no for an answer?
00:59:29.066,00:59:31.651,He was...? Did you see?
00:59:31.693,00:59:36.948,Would you just listen to me?
00:59:38.783,00:59:40.618,"Hi, there. Hi."
00:59:40.660,00:59:42.620,I just wanted to say I'm really sorry.
00:59:42.662,00:59:45.623,I shouldn't have barged in here without telling you what was going down.
00:59:45.665,00:59:49.794,"It wasn't fair to you, and it wasn't fair to the kids, especially after everything they've been through."
00:59:49.836,00:59:51.422,And I... God!
00:59:51.463,00:59:54.091,God! I just... I'm taking them back to the hospital.
00:59:54.132,00:59:56.134,Just wanted to say I'm really sorry.
00:59:56.176,00:59:57.635,That's okay. That's fine.
00:59:57.677,01:00:01.848,"See, I volunteer down at Saint Margarita's in the children's wing, teaching music."
01:00:01.890,01:00:03.975,Really?
01:00:04.017,01:00:05.727,That's very nice.
01:00:04.017,01:00:07.645,"Actually, no, it isn't, because I totally screwed up."
01:00:07.687,01:00:13.818,"I told the kids if they practice, they'd get into Battle of the Bands."
01:00:13.860,01:00:15.028,What did you tell them that for?
01:00:15.070,01:00:17.030,I don't know.
01:00:17.072,01:00:22.327,"I wanted to give them something to look forward to, something to keep their spirits up."
01:00:22.369,01:00:23.537,Oh... look at them.
01:00:23.579,01:00:27.374,They're terminal.
01:00:27.416,01:00:30.001,Every last one of them.
01:00:33.004,01:00:33.964,Geez.
01:00:34.005,01:00:39.010,"Yeah, and all they wanted to do before they bit the dust was play Battle of the Bands."
01:00:39.052,01:00:41.138,What do they all have?
01:00:41.179,01:00:42.806,"It's a, uh..."
01:00:44.516,01:00:45.976,It's a rare blood disease.
01:00:46.017,01:00:50.105,Stick-it-to-da-man-i-osis.
01:00:50.147,01:00:52.816,What's that?
01:00:52.857,01:00:54.943,You're lucky.
01:00:54.985,01:00:56.194,Because it's hell.
01:00:56.236,01:00:59.156,Wow!
01:01:08.582,01:01:09.749,We're on the bill.
01:01:11.084,01:01:13.545,Cut it out!
01:01:16.381,01:01:18.008,Get in the van.
01:01:42.407,01:01:45.869,"Summer, you get an A-plus and 50 gold stars."
01:01:45.910,01:01:47.996,I didn't do it for the grade.
01:01:48.038,01:01:50.207,Give me some of that.
01:01:50.248,01:01:52.876,Yeah!
01:02:16.941,01:02:18.818,"Hey, Mr. S."
01:02:18.860,01:02:20.862,We have a name for the band.
01:02:20.904,01:02:22.280,Hit me.
01:02:26.826,01:02:30.914,The School of Rock.
01:02:30.955,01:02:34.543,The School... of Rock.
01:02:36.294,01:02:42.342,And we shall teach rock and roll to the world.
01:02:54.563,01:02:55.731,Stop.
01:02:55.772,01:02:59.901,We have a Red Alert.
01:02:59.943,01:03:01.778,To your positions.
01:03:01.819,01:03:04.989,To your positions!
01:03:07.325,01:03:09.494,"Come on, come on."
01:03:16.000,01:03:22.382,"And therefore, E equals M C-squared."
01:03:22.424,01:03:23.967,"Oh, Miss Mullins."
01:03:24.008,01:03:30.474,"I'm sorry to interrupt, but Miss Lemmons said she heard music coming from the classroom."
01:03:30.515,01:03:31.683,DEWEY: Music?
01:03:31.725,01:03:36.396,Uh... music.
01:03:36.438,01:03:37.648,"Uh-oh, you know what?"
01:03:37.689,01:03:39.941,"Miss Lemmons must be on crack, right, kids?"
01:03:39.983,01:03:41.901,KIDS: Mm-hmm.
01:03:41.943,01:03:46.281,Well... well... what's that?
01:03:49.785,01:03:52.496,"Oh, that. Yeah."
01:03:52.537,01:03:54.080,Hmm...
01:03:54.122,01:03:55.373,We were singing and we were learning.
01:03:55.415,01:03:59.586,We were learning in sing-song.
01:03:59.628,01:04:02.046,Huh... one of your methods?
01:04:02.088,01:04:04.341,Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
01:04:04.382,01:04:10.180,I find that it's really helpful when you're teaching the subjects that are the boring subjects...
01:04:10.221,01:04:12.349,Huh.
01:04:12.390,01:04:18.647,"Well, you don't mind if I just sit in on your class this afternoon, do you?"
01:04:18.689,01:04:19.981,No. No.
01:04:20.023,01:04:21.274,Come on back this afternoon.
01:04:21.316,01:04:25.320,It is the afternoon.
01:04:25.362,01:04:30.367,"So, please, just continue with your method."
01:04:30.408,01:04:32.703,Yeah.
01:04:32.744,01:04:34.579,Okay.
01:05:11.032,01:05:14.285,Negative one.
01:05:19.207,01:05:22.001,Six billion?
01:05:22.043,01:05:23.712,Nailed it.
01:05:23.754,01:05:28.800,"What is the answer, Marta?"
01:05:28.842,01:05:30.093,Nine.
01:05:50.488,01:06:00.957,"I'm very happy that you're able to extend your stay, but I, I must say I-I find your methods of teaching very unusual."
01:06:00.998,01:06:04.961,"Well, I did study with Dr. Errol Von Straussenburger..."
01:06:05.002,01:06:07.631,Who?
01:06:07.672,01:06:14.178,"Oh, he's... he's like one of the leading leaders in... unusual methods."
01:06:14.220,01:06:21.185,"Actually, he's how I was appointed to the Presidential Council for Experimental Educationers."
01:06:21.227,01:06:28.318,"That sounds very impressive, but we're not interested in experimental education here."
01:06:28.359,01:06:33.490,"So, if from now on, if you could just stick to the curriculum, that would be great."
01:06:33.531,01:06:34.658,Yes. Right.
01:06:34.699,01:06:35.867,Thank you.
01:06:35.909,01:06:37.494,"Uh, Ros..."
01:06:37.535,01:06:39.329,Yes?
01:06:39.370,01:06:43.667,"Do you know I would really love to talk some more about your philosophy on, you know, teaching."
01:06:43.708,01:06:47.295,Do you think maybe we could grab some coffee?
01:06:47.337,01:06:50.841,You want to go get some coffee with me?
01:06:50.882,01:06:53.176,Yeah. I really would.
01:06:58.473,01:07:01.142,And you're sure you don't have any coffee?
01:07:01.184,01:07:04.228,Uh-huh. I'm quite sure.
01:07:06.773,01:07:09.359,"Well, I-I've never been here before."
01:07:09.400,01:07:10.443,Mmm...
01:07:10.485,01:07:15.072,"I-I-I've never been to this side of town before, in fact."
01:07:15.114,01:07:16.867,Mmm... ahh.
01:07:16.908,01:07:22.914,"So, I, uh, have been..."
01:07:16.908,01:07:25.291,"well, I have been... dying to ask you something, Mr. Schneebly."
01:07:25.333,01:07:27.961,"Please, call me Dewey."
01:07:28.003,01:07:30.087,Dewey?
01:07:30.129,01:07:31.631,Ned?
01:07:31.673,01:07:32.757,Call me Ned.
01:07:32.799,01:07:35.802,I was thinking of my other name.
01:07:35.844,01:07:37.345,My middle name.
01:07:37.387,01:07:38.513,Oh.
01:07:38.555,01:07:39.556,Yeah.
01:07:39.597,01:07:41.766,"Well, um, Ned..."
01:07:43.810,01:07:49.566,"in your experience, how does Horace Green compare to the other schools that you've taught at?"
01:07:49.607,01:07:50.775,Oh...
01:07:50.817,01:07:52.193,your school is the best.
01:07:52.235,01:07:54.070,You're just saying that.
01:07:54.111,01:07:55.363,I'm not.
01:07:55.405,01:07:58.282,Do you know that kids at other schools just have fun all the time?
01:07:58.324,01:07:59.409,They're running around.
01:07:59.450,01:08:01.077,There's no discipline.
01:08:01.118,01:08:02.871,They're happy.
01:08:02.913,01:08:05.916,This is the best school I have ever teached at.
01:08:05.957,01:08:08.251,I swear.
01:08:08.292,01:08:09.711,I'll drink to that.
01:08:15.717,01:08:16.760,You stay right there.
01:08:16.801,01:08:18.678,I'm going to go put on some music.
01:08:18.720,01:08:20.263,Oh.
01:08:55.882,01:08:57.717,I love this song.
01:08:57.759,01:08:59.385,Really?
01:08:59.427,01:09:01.220,Stevie Nicks.
01:09:01.262,01:09:02.806,Stevie!
01:09:02.847,01:09:08.812,"You know, she came to town and she did a concert and she was just so..."
01:09:08.853,01:09:10.021,whacked!
01:09:10.063,01:09:12.482,"Oh, oh, my gosh."
01:09:12.523,01:09:14.317,She put on the best show I've ever seen.
01:09:15.902,01:09:18.571,And she is so much better live then she is on the album.
01:09:18.613,01:09:20.657,You know what I mean.
01:09:20.698,01:09:22.283,"Oh, my gosh, no comparison."
01:09:22.325,01:09:25.662,Yeah. You know what?
01:09:25.703,01:09:29.124,"Oh, man, I would love to take the kids to a concert."
01:09:29.165,01:09:30.416,Concert?
01:09:30.458,01:09:33.003,Yeah. There's one at the end of the month.
01:09:33.044,01:09:34.170,It would be perfect.
01:09:34.211,01:09:35.171,The Philharmonic.
01:09:35.212,01:09:36.339,They do the classics.
01:09:36.380,01:09:40.426,"They do Beethoven, Mozart, Enya..."
01:09:40.468,01:09:42.095,that kind of stuff.
01:09:42.137,01:09:43.847,Huh?
01:09:43.888,01:09:47.224,"Oh, but you guys have a policy about field trips, huh?"
01:09:47.266,01:09:50.520,Would it be educational?
01:09:50.561,01:09:51.688,Would it be educational?
01:09:51.729,01:09:54.858,It could be very educational.
01:09:57.234,01:09:58.695,Maybe we can make an exception.
01:09:58.736,01:09:59.988,Yes!
01:10:05.409,01:10:08.204,I'm holding you to that.
01:10:08.245,01:10:10.165,Make an exception...
01:10:20.675,01:10:40.195,"DEWEY: Would you stop that, please?"
01:10:40.236,01:10:42.572,Yeah.
01:10:43.740,01:10:46.910,I had a... I had a really nice time.
01:10:46.951,01:10:48.203,"Yeah, ditto."
01:10:48.244,01:10:53.917,"You know, this is the first time any teacher has ever asked me to do anything outside of school."
01:10:53.958,01:10:55.418,No way.
01:10:55.459,01:10:56.920,"It's, it's true."
01:10:56.961,01:11:00.590,In... six years.
01:11:02.508,01:11:08.139,"Well, you know, I think it might just be one of those things where people are a little intimidated."
01:11:08.181,01:11:10.808,Intimidated?
01:11:12.060,01:11:13.269,They hate me.
01:11:13.310,01:11:15.105,No. They don't.
01:11:15.146,01:11:16.355,They sure do.
01:11:16.397,01:11:18.524,"I wasn't always like this, you know."
01:11:18.566,01:11:20.693,I wasn't always wound this tight.
01:11:20.735,01:11:23.154,There was a time when I was fun.
01:11:23.196,01:11:25.406,I was funny.
01:11:25.448,01:11:33.248,"I was, but you can't be funny and be the... the principal of a prep school."
01:11:33.289,01:11:39.712,"No. You cannot, because when it comes to their kids, these parents..."
01:11:39.754,01:11:43.633,"No. And, and if, anything goes wrong, it's my head. All right?"
01:11:43.674,01:11:45.260,It's my head in the smasher.
01:11:45.301,01:11:50.181,These parents will come down on me like a nuclear bomb.
01:11:50.223,01:11:51.808,I can't make a mistake.
01:11:51.849,01:11:59.899,"I gotta be perfect, and that pressure has turned me into one thing that I never wanted to be..."
01:12:01.567,01:12:03.111,No. You're not.
01:12:03.153,01:12:04.279,"Yes, I am."
01:12:04.320,01:12:06.072,I am a big one.
01:12:06.114,01:12:08.365,"Well, I don't think so."
01:12:08.407,01:12:11.202,I think you're pretty cool.
01:12:11.244,01:12:14.038,Really?
01:12:14.080,01:12:15.290,No.
01:12:15.331,01:12:18.334,Yeah. You're way cool.
01:12:18.375,01:12:19.376,Really?
01:12:24.090,01:12:25.175,"SUMMER: Okay, drums?"
01:12:25.216,01:12:26.050,DEWEY: House.
01:12:26.092,01:12:27.177,SUMMER: Keyboards?
01:12:27.218,01:12:28.385,DEWEY: House.
01:12:28.427,01:12:29.553,Amps?
01:12:29.595,01:12:31.472,All right. Cable?
01:12:31.514,01:12:33.599,All right. Guitar?
01:12:33.641,01:12:35.101,Mr. S.
01:12:35.143,01:12:36.102,What do you think?
01:12:36.144,01:12:37.979,Mmm!
01:12:41.398,01:12:42.900,Uh...
01:12:44.319,01:12:46.362,I don't know. I...
01:12:46.403,01:12:48.698,They might be a little distracting.
01:12:48.739,01:12:53.452,It's glitter rock and it's glam and its fabulous.
01:12:53.494,01:12:55.371,"Billy, it's just not the right style."
01:12:55.412,01:12:58.708,Style? You're gonna to talk to me about style?
01:12:58.749,01:13:01.711,You can't even dress yourself.
01:13:01.752,01:13:03.713,Don't you be talking about my bow tie.
01:13:03.754,01:13:05.048,You know what? I give up.
01:13:05.089,01:13:07.717,They can just wear their uniforms.
01:13:07.758,01:13:10.887,That's not a bad idea.
01:13:10.928,01:13:12.555,Not a bad idea?
01:13:12.596,01:13:14.265,I was kidding.
01:13:14.307,01:13:15.432,Excuse me.
01:13:17.185,01:13:18.394,"Hey, hey, ho-ha."
01:13:18.435,01:13:19.395,What is that?
01:13:19.436,01:13:20.355,What's what?
01:13:20.396,01:13:21.438,What are you playing?
01:13:21.480,01:13:22.982,It's just something I wrote.
01:13:23.024,01:13:26.485,You wrote a song?
01:13:26.527,01:13:28.654,"Well, let's hear it."
01:13:28.696,01:13:30.406,"Nah, it's not that good."
01:13:30.447,01:13:33.743,"Come on, I want to hear it, Kurt Cobain."
01:13:33.784,01:13:36.371,"Okay, but I'm not much of a singer."
01:13:36.412,01:13:37.788,That's all right.
01:13:53.096,01:13:56.266,Wait. You wrote that?
01:13:56.307,01:13:58.268,You wrote that?
01:13:58.309,01:13:59.476,"Okay, that's it."
01:13:59.518,01:14:00.477,Rock and roll positions.
01:14:00.519,01:14:01.979,What are you doing?
01:14:02.021,01:14:04.023,What am I doing?
01:14:04.065,01:14:05.108,But why?
01:14:05.149,01:14:08.152,"Because that's what bands do, man-- play each other's songs."
01:14:08.194,01:14:09.237,You got lyrics?
01:14:09.279,01:14:11.572,Hook me up.
01:14:13.532,01:14:14.617,No more secret songs.
01:14:14.658,01:14:18.121,"All right, Lawrence, no more reading."
01:14:18.162,01:14:19.622,Time for rock.
01:14:19.663,01:14:20.915,Get on the drum.
01:14:20.957,01:14:22.250,Bass it up.
01:14:22.292,01:14:23.459,What was that first chord?
01:14:23.500,01:14:25.420,D.
01:14:25.461,01:14:26.421,D...
01:14:26.462,01:14:27.422,C...
01:14:27.463,01:14:29.299,G...
01:14:29.340,01:14:30.716,C...
01:14:33.261,01:14:34.553,Yeah. Yeah.
01:14:36.431,01:14:37.974,Mm-hmm.
01:14:40.268,01:14:51.487,ALL: You know what would be better though?
01:14:51.528,01:14:52.989,You know what would be better?
01:14:53.030,01:14:55.658,"If it was rock got no reason, rock got no rhyme."
01:14:55.699,01:14:56.993,You know? Can we try that?
01:14:57.034,01:14:58.161,"And also, we need some, Ooh, la-la's."
01:14:58.202,01:15:00.830,"So like, Ooh, la-la-la, ooh, la-la-la."
01:15:00.871,01:15:02.165,"Try that at the chorus, okay?"
01:15:02.206,01:15:03.540,Can we try it from the chorus?
01:15:03.582,01:15:06.669,"One, two, three, four."
01:15:35.365,01:15:37.700,Wow! Boop!
01:15:41.620,01:15:45.375,I'm going to take a solo there if it's cool with you.
01:15:45.416,01:15:46.750,All right.
01:15:46.792,01:15:48.044,And then you can solo later.
01:15:48.085,01:15:49.337,Okay.
01:15:49.379,01:15:51.714,"But let me just rock a solo there, I can feel it."
01:15:59.514,01:16:00.806,All right...
01:16:00.848,01:16:04.601,"tomorrow is the big day, so get your rest."
01:16:04.643,01:16:07.897,"No late-night parties, drinking tequila and trying to get lucky."
01:16:07.938,01:16:12.360,Chances like this do not come around every day.
01:16:12.402,01:16:18.908,"Now, you've played hard in here people, and I am proud of every last stinking one of you."
01:16:18.949,01:16:21.494,So let's just give this everything we got.
01:16:21.536,01:16:26.332,"We may fall on our faces, but if we do, we will fall with dignity!"
01:16:26.374,01:16:29.544,With a guitar in our hands and rock in our hearts!
01:16:29.585,01:16:39.512,And in the words of AC/DC-- We roll tonight to the guitar bite and for those about to rock...
01:16:39.554,01:16:42.139,I salute you.
01:16:55.236,01:16:59.365,"Ros, excuse me, I just wanted to remind you about our little field trip tomorrow."
01:16:59.407,01:17:00.950,What field trip?
01:17:00.991,01:17:03.619,The educational concert we were talking about.
01:17:03.660,01:17:04.995,"Oh. Oh, I forgot about that."
01:17:05.037,01:17:10.793,"I don't know, you know, school policy is very difficult to get around in this situation."
01:17:10.834,01:17:15.339,"Remember, you said we could make an exception, and the kids are all excited about hearing some Mozart."
01:17:15.381,01:17:23.139,"I know, but... the preparations, there's not enough time, I don't know anything about it. Where is it?"
01:17:23.180,01:17:26.601,"Well, I've got it all covered. What's going on?"
01:17:26.642,01:17:28.144,Are you mad at me or something?
01:17:28.185,01:17:29.479,"No, no, Ned."
01:17:29.520,01:17:34.650,"I'm sorry, I'm just a little stressed out because it's Parents' Night tonight."
01:17:34.691,01:17:39.696,"Hey, it's all gonna be fine."
01:17:41.491,01:17:43.159,Ned?
01:17:43.200,01:17:47.371,Would you mind coming with me tonight to Parents' Night?
01:17:47.413,01:17:49.248,It wouldn't be a date or anything like that.
01:17:49.290,01:17:55.838,"It's just that, you know, I get nervous around the parents and there's something about you that makes me feel a little more relaxed."
01:17:55.879,01:17:59.550,"You know what, that sounds so great, Ros, but, uh..."
01:17:59.592,01:18:01.051,But what?
01:18:01.093,01:18:04.472,I wasn't planning on going tonight.
01:18:04.514,01:18:06.974,But you have to come.
01:18:07.016,01:18:08.643,You have to give the presentation.
01:18:08.684,01:18:10.394,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
01:18:10.436,01:18:12.688,"No, I got you."
01:18:12.729,01:18:14.231,So we'll go together?
01:18:14.273,01:18:20.530,"Okay. Uh, why don't you pick me up at say 6:40."
01:18:20.571,01:18:21.697,Done.
01:18:21.738,01:18:24.241,All right.
01:18:29.455,01:18:30.706,What are you all dressed up for?
01:18:30.747,01:18:34.627,"Uh, I got a hot date."
01:18:34.669,01:18:36.295,That's weird.
01:18:36.337,01:18:40.049,"I got a check from Horace Green Prep for $1,200."
01:18:40.090,01:18:42.218,I've never even worked there.
01:18:44.595,01:18:46.305,What are you doing?
01:18:46.347,01:18:48.683,Calling the school.
01:18:50.601,01:18:52.395,"Hi, this is Ned Schneebly..."
01:18:56.315,01:18:57.650,Dewey...
01:18:57.692,01:18:59.360,what's going on?
01:18:59.402,01:19:03.573,"I told them 15 times, make it out to cash!"
01:19:03.614,01:19:06.617,Dewey?
01:19:06.659,01:19:09.412,"I did something bad, Ned."
01:19:09.453,01:19:10.954,No.
01:19:10.996,01:19:17.378,"They called looking for a sub and I said I was you just to make some money; but then I got there and the kids, they rock, man."
01:19:17.420,01:19:21.507,"There's this kid Larry who's like, I'm not cool, but now he's all..."
01:19:23.467,01:19:31.767,"And there's this other girl ...but then she thought she was too fat to sing, so they were all dying of this rare blood disease, and the principal got drunk..."
01:19:31.808,01:19:34.604,"And now we're playing tomorrow at Battle of the Bands, isn't that great?"
01:19:34.645,01:19:36.439,It's the coolest thing that ever happened.
01:19:36.480,01:19:38.148,"One day, that's all I ask, Ned, and then I will come clean."
01:19:38.190,01:19:39.734,I'll tell everyone it was my fault.
01:19:39.775,01:19:41.569,He had nothing to do with it; you'll be fine. One day!
01:19:41.611,01:19:43.529,"PATTY: Ned, home."
01:19:43.571,01:19:45.698,Please. She'll blow it.
01:19:45.740,01:19:46.865,Don't say anything. Please.
01:19:51.787,01:19:54.582,Hey. What's going on?
01:19:54.624,01:19:55.999,Nothing.
01:19:56.041,01:19:59.336,"I got a hot date, that's what's going on."
01:20:01.838,01:20:03.924,See you later.
01:20:09.805,01:20:10.931,"What's going on, Ned?"
01:20:10.973,01:20:13.684,Nothing.
01:20:13.726,01:20:15.436,Nothing? Well...
01:20:31.160,01:20:35.164,"Okay, I don't think I can go in there."
01:20:35.205,01:20:38.000,What's wrong?
01:20:38.041,01:20:41.003,I'm not a teacher.
01:20:41.044,01:20:45.591,"Oh, Ned."
01:20:45.633,01:20:49.595,"No, no."
01:20:49.637,01:20:51.681,No. You're not.
01:20:51.722,01:20:57.186,"You're a dedicated, talented teacher, and those parents are gonna love you."
01:20:57.227,01:21:02.065,Now just get in there and tell those parents what you've been teaching their kids.
01:21:02.107,01:21:10.032,"DEWEY: Yeah, you know, uh, math, English, uh... what, science, what else?"
01:21:10.073,01:21:18.833,"Uh, geography, history, Latin, Spanish, French, Latin, uh, math..."
01:21:18.874,01:21:20.209,"did I say that, right?"
01:21:20.250,01:21:26.674,"Anyway, you know, just all this stuff you want your kids to know, it's being covered, okay?"
01:21:26.716,01:21:28.551,So...
01:21:28.592,01:21:33.764,"it was great to meet you all and, uh, drive safe."
01:21:33.806,01:21:35.015,MAN: Excuse me.
01:21:35.057,01:21:37.810,"Ever since you started teaching here, all my son can talk about is music."
01:21:37.852,01:21:40.103,"He says when he grows up, he wants to be a musician."
01:21:40.145,01:21:42.356,Is this your influence?
01:21:40.145,01:21:45.942,"Yeah, well, Mr. Schneebly, why has my daughter become obsessed with David Geffen?"
01:21:45.984,01:21:47.903,And how is this homework?
01:21:47.944,01:22:04.628,"Okay, see, I would like to tell you about what we've been doing in here, but there's such a thing as teacher-student confidentiality and I don't want to be in breach of educational law because I could be dismembered by the teacher's union."
01:22:04.670,01:22:05.921,So...
01:22:05.962,01:22:07.923,You expect us to believe this garbage?
01:22:07.964,01:22:09.759,I...
01:22:09.800,01:22:14.012,"TOMIKA: Mr. S., don't you think you should just tell them about the project?"
01:22:14.054,01:22:15.514,LARRY: Our class project.
01:22:15.556,01:22:17.558,Every school in the state is competing.
01:22:17.600,01:22:19.769,MAN: Competing?
01:22:19.810,01:22:22.938,"It's not till next quarter, but Mr. S. wanted us to get a head start."
01:22:22.979,01:22:25.148,"WOMAN: Well, what's the project, Summer?"
01:22:25.190,01:22:26.609,It's prestigious.
01:22:26.650,01:22:29.278,"It will go on our permanent record, Mom."
01:22:29.319,01:22:30.487,Hmm.
01:22:30.529,01:22:34.450,"You might as well tell them, Mr. Schneebly."
01:22:34.491,01:22:39.121,"Okay, look, I've gotten to know your kids over the past few weeks and they are awesome."
01:22:39.162,01:22:40.581,Zack is an insane guitarist.
01:22:40.623,01:22:43.459,"He's the next Hendrix, and he's ten years old."
01:22:43.500,01:22:46.002,"And Gordon here, he's a genius!"
01:22:46.044,01:22:50.340,He did a whole professional light show on his computer in three days.
01:22:50.382,01:22:53.969,"And, um, and-and-and Marta here, she's-she's..."
01:22:54.010,01:22:55.596,she can hit an A above high C.
01:22:55.638,01:22:57.306,Did you know that?
01:22:57.347,01:22:58.724,Not many singers can do that.
01:22:58.766,01:23:00.392,"And-and, uh..."
01:23:00.434,01:23:02.645,uh... uh...
01:23:02.686,01:23:10.360,"Summer, Summer is going to be the first woman President of the United States of America, and she could run later this year even and I would vote for her."
01:23:10.402,01:23:12.780,"Look, you guys, they're just all really cool kids."
01:23:12.822,01:23:15.198,"If they were mine, I would be so proud."
01:23:15.240,01:23:18.201,"And I am proud, just to even know them."
01:23:18.243,01:23:20.370,"And, um..."
01:23:20.412,01:23:22.372,"Sir, can I see you in the hall for a moment?"
01:23:22.414,01:23:25.041,Can I just... let me just say a couple more things.
01:23:25.083,01:23:26.251,MAN: What's going on?
01:23:26.293,01:23:28.337,"What's happening, Officer?"
01:23:28.378,01:23:31.006,"Apparently, that man is not Ned Schneebly."
01:23:31.047,01:23:32.800,What?
01:23:32.842,01:23:35.010,This man is Ned Schneebly.
01:23:35.051,01:23:36.846,"Yeah, he's not even a teacher."
01:23:36.887,01:23:38.054,You called the cops?
01:23:38.096,01:23:41.057,She did. She got it out of me.
01:23:41.099,01:23:43.185,You're apologizing to him?
01:23:43.226,01:23:46.021,Sorry.
01:23:46.062,01:23:48.398,Ned.
01:23:49.191,01:23:53.153,"Ned, is-is this true?"
01:23:53.195,01:23:55.531,Who are you?
01:23:56.406,01:24:08.627,"My name is Dewey Finn and, no, I'm not a licensed teacher, but I have been touched by your kids and I'm pretty sure I've touched them."
01:24:14.090,01:24:15.592,What?
01:24:31.233,01:24:33.736,I've nothing to say to you.
01:24:33.777,01:24:36.363,"Me, either."
01:24:36.405,01:24:38.114,I'm going to bed.
01:24:38.156,01:24:45.288,"You know, Dewey, it's one thing to throw your life away, but then to put Ned's career in jeopardy is so selfish."
01:24:43.328,01:24:46.623,"Hey, you're the one who told me to be like Ned and get a job."
01:24:46.665,01:24:50.168,"Yeah, I told you to be like Ned, Dewey, I didn't tell you to be Ned."
01:24:50.210,01:24:52.004,And you're not even going to apologize?
01:24:52.046,01:24:55.049,You're the one who should apologize for calling the cops.
01:24:55.090,01:24:58.260,"It's not like I murdered anybody, I just wanted to play a great show."
01:24:58.301,01:25:00.930,I was this close.
01:25:00.971,01:25:06.226,Would you both just cut it out for one second?
01:25:11.774,01:25:15.151,"Look, I'm sorry, dude."
01:25:15.193,01:25:16.445,You can't understand.
01:25:16.486,01:25:17.947,It was easy for you to give up music.
01:25:17.988,01:25:19.197,It ain't easy for me.
01:25:19.239,01:25:23.159,It wasn't easy for me.
01:25:23.201,01:25:25.662,"Well, then why'd you give it up?"
01:25:25.704,01:25:27.581,Because I couldn't keep kidding myself anymore.
01:25:27.623,01:25:34.713,"You can blame it all on bad luck, but in the end, maybe we just weren't that good."
01:25:34.755,01:25:37.800,Sometimes you got to know when to quit.
01:25:37.841,01:25:39.509,"Maybe you're right, maybe I suck."
01:25:39.551,01:25:41.011,That's not what I said.
01:25:41.053,01:25:43.513,"Well, music is my life, man."
01:25:43.555,01:25:45.474,What do you want me to do?
01:25:45.515,01:25:47.517,I don't know.
01:25:47.559,01:25:53.523,But... I think it's time you moved out.
01:25:53.565,01:25:56.902,Sorry.
01:26:02.449,01:26:05.285,So his name really wasn't Mr. Schneebly?
01:26:05.327,01:26:09.289,"No, it was, like, Dewey something."
01:26:09.331,01:26:10.666,What about the project?
01:26:10.707,01:26:12.709,"Wake up, Marco, there was no project."
01:26:12.751,01:26:15.921,He just wanted us to play a show so we could make some money.
01:26:15.963,01:26:18.507,I can't believe we weren't getting graded on any of this.
01:26:18.548,01:26:20.175,What are you so bummed about?
01:26:20.216,01:26:21.510,We had a three-week vacation.
01:26:21.551,01:26:25.014,"Yeah, it was a waste of time, but it was a lot better than school."
01:26:25.055,01:26:26.473,It was not a waste of time.
01:26:26.515,01:26:29.309,"I hate to break it to you, bro, but, yeah, that's what it was."
01:26:29.351,01:26:30.519,You're an idiot.
01:26:30.560,01:26:31.979,"Hey, shut up."
01:26:32.021,01:26:34.523,"Hey, you want to go? Huh?"
01:26:32.021,01:26:36.775,"Hey, if you touch him, I'll shove those sticks down your throat, got it?"
01:26:36.817,01:26:41.488,Mr. S. was cool. And we worked too long and too hard not to play this show.
01:26:41.530,01:26:43.866,"Well, okay, so what are we supposed to do?"
01:26:43.907,01:26:46.535,I say we get out of here and play the damn show.
01:26:46.576,01:26:50.497,"How could you let our children be exposed to this impostor, this maniac?"
01:26:50.539,01:26:52.791,Do you just let anyone walk off the street and teach here?
01:26:55.085,01:27:03.218,Let me assure you that nothing is more important to us than for you to feel your children are in a safe and secure environment.
01:27:15.605,01:27:17.315,"Okay, we're all here for the field trip."
01:27:17.357,01:27:18.441,Where's Mr. Schneebly?
01:27:18.483,01:27:19.442,He didn't tell you?
01:27:19.484,01:27:21.070,He's at his house.
01:27:21.111,01:27:25.448,We need to go pick him up.
01:27:30.037,01:27:31.955,Excuse me.
01:27:31.997,01:27:34.499,"Just one second, please."
01:27:35.751,01:27:37.419,"Wait a minute, wait a minute."
01:27:37.460,01:27:38.795,Where are you going?
01:27:40.881,01:27:42.883,One second!
01:27:58.273,01:28:00.692,Where did they go?
01:28:00.734,01:28:01.902,Help!
01:28:01.944,01:28:02.986,Children!
01:28:05.197,01:28:07.824,Wake up.
01:28:15.082,01:28:17.292,How'd you guys get in here?
01:28:17.333,01:28:19.878,Front door was open.
01:28:19.920,01:28:21.504,Why aren't you guys in school?
01:28:21.546,01:28:24.007,We did what you told us; we stuck it to the man.
01:28:24.049,01:28:25.759,Forget about what I told you.
01:28:25.801,01:28:27.970,"Look, I'm a loser, okay?"
01:28:28.011,01:28:30.847,"You listen to my advice, you'll end up like me, with nothing."
01:28:30.889,01:28:33.642,"Come on, man, quit goofing around."
01:28:33.683,01:28:36.645,This is serious business.
01:28:36.686,01:28:39.856,One great rock show can change the world.
01:28:41.441,01:28:43.026,Look out the window.
01:28:51.034,01:28:52.161,Mr. S!
01:28:52.202,01:28:54.746,Come down!
01:28:54.788,01:28:57.207,No way.
01:28:57.249,01:28:59.168,That is so punk rock.
01:29:01.920,01:29:06.925,"The dining room table seats 14, with no inserts..."
01:29:12.973,01:29:14.224,What's going on?
01:29:14.266,01:29:16.601,We've got some rocking to do.
01:29:28.280,01:29:30.657,Yes!
01:29:30.699,01:29:32.117,"Hi, Mr. Schneebly."
01:29:32.159,01:29:33.785,How's it going?
01:29:33.827,01:29:35.662,Whoo!
01:29:35.704,01:29:40.876,"You guys, all I can say is, let's rock."
01:29:42.418,01:29:43.920,Yeah!
01:29:42.418,01:29:49.592,One more thing: I want to say I'm sorry that I used you guys.
01:29:52.470,01:29:54.556,I'm sorry I lied.
01:29:54.597,01:29:56.225,And it's not cool to lie to your band.
01:29:56.266,01:29:58.352,"Come on, we're going to be late."
01:29:58.392,01:29:59.561,There's no time for apologies.
01:29:59.602,01:30:01.230,"Let's go, come on."
01:30:01.271,01:30:02.564,"All right, let's go."
01:30:02.605,01:30:06.276,Where are you going?
01:30:06.318,01:30:07.485,Do you want to go?
01:30:07.527,01:30:09.779,"Yeah, I want to go."
01:30:09.821,01:30:12.115,"I don't want to miss this, Patty."
01:30:12.157,01:30:13.742,Unbelievable.
01:30:13.783,01:30:15.702,After everything he's done to you?
01:30:15.744,01:30:17.287,That is so typical Ned.
01:30:17.329,01:30:19.581,When are you going to stop being a pushover?
01:30:19.622,01:30:23.001,When are you finally going to start sticking up for yourself?
01:30:28.422,01:30:31.467,Excuse me...
01:30:31.509,01:30:33.262,Excuse me.
01:30:33.303,01:30:38.725,I have just been informed that all of your children are missing.
01:30:38.767,01:30:41.603,So...
01:31:01.748,01:31:03.292,Hey.
01:31:03.333,01:31:06.128,"Yeah, we're competing; we're the School of Rock."
01:31:06.169,01:31:08.130,You and all these kids?
01:31:08.171,01:31:09.547,"You'd better get in here, hurry up."
01:31:09.589,01:31:11.758,"Okay, come on, you guys."
01:31:11.800,01:31:12.926,Hey. We're here.
01:31:12.968,01:31:14.386,You're late.
01:31:14.428,01:31:16.430,"Okay, we'll be ready, come on."
01:31:16.470,01:31:17.722,"Zack, check this out."
01:31:17.764,01:31:19.473,"Whoa, it's awesome."
01:31:31.361,01:31:33.447,"Guys, you don't have to listen to those hacks."
01:31:33.487,01:31:37.200,"Come on, band meeting right now, gather round."
01:31:37.242,01:31:39.453,All right.
01:31:39.493,01:31:40.578,We're set.
01:31:40.620,01:31:41.788,"Okay, Gordon, what about the lights?"
01:31:41.830,01:31:43.123,The light board is up in the balcony.
01:31:43.165,01:31:44.582,I'll patch it up there.
01:31:44.624,01:31:46.626,"And, Billy, how's beautification?"
01:31:46.668,01:31:49.129,Are you kidding?
01:31:49.171,01:31:55.718,"We only have one song to let these guys know who we are, so I think we should play Zack's."
01:31:55.760,01:31:57.262,But why?
01:31:57.304,01:31:58.680,Yes.
01:31:58.721,01:31:59.806,"The thing is, you guys."
01:31:59.848,01:32:01.683,I ain't that good.
01:32:01.724,01:32:02.934,"I'm not, and I can admit it."
01:32:02.976,01:32:05.687,"But you, dude, you're ten years old, you're already better than me."
01:32:05.728,01:32:08.482,"Your song rocks harder, so let's play it."
01:32:08.522,01:32:09.649,"But, hey, you know what?"
01:32:09.691,01:32:10.900,That's just one guy's opinion.
01:32:10.942,01:32:13.527,"This ain't my band, it's our band."
01:32:13.569,01:32:14.946,We all have a say.
01:32:14.988,01:32:17.282,We haven't practiced that one as much.
01:32:17.324,01:32:18.741,"I mean, we might not win."
01:32:18.783,01:32:20.869,"Hey, we didn't come here to win."
01:32:20.910,01:32:22.745,We came here to play one great show.
01:32:22.787,01:32:26.041,"And on Zack's song, you guys really rock."
01:32:26.082,01:32:30.379,"You know my vote, who else is with me?"
01:32:30.420,01:32:32.881,"All right, let's pray."
01:32:32.922,01:32:37.010,"God of Rock, thank you for this chance to kick ass."
01:32:37.052,01:32:43.892,"We are your humble servants, please give us the power to blow people's minds with our high-voltage rock."
01:32:43.933,01:32:45.894,In your name we pray. Amen.
01:32:45.935,01:32:47.354,Amen.
01:32:47.396,01:32:49.981,Now let's get out there and melt some faces!
01:32:50.023,01:32:52.566,Yeah!
01:32:52.608,01:32:53.735,"All right, but you got to sing it."
01:32:53.776,01:32:55.278,Are you sure?
01:32:55.320,01:32:57.489,"Yeah, it's cool, I'm no singer."
01:32:57.531,01:32:58.948,"Okay, I'll sing it."
01:32:58.990,01:33:01.826,Yeah?
01:33:01.868,01:33:03.537,All the cues are to the other song.
01:33:03.577,01:33:06.248,"Okay, Gordon, you're just going to have to feel it."
01:33:06.289,01:33:07.832,You've got to improvise.
01:33:07.874,01:33:11.294,"You know this song, I know you can do it."
01:33:11.336,01:33:12.379,Okay.
01:33:12.421,01:33:14.256,Run like the wind.
01:33:14.297,01:33:16.425,Hey. What's this?
01:33:16.466,01:33:19.261,"You wanted to go with the uniform, so put it on."
01:33:19.302,01:33:21.971,Quick.
01:33:51.334,01:33:52.461,"Whoa, slow down, old man."
01:33:52.502,01:33:54.129,My son is in there.
01:33:54.170,01:33:55.671,My son is in there; he's ten years old.
01:33:55.713,01:33:57.090,I don't care how old he is.
01:33:57.132,01:33:59.134,You're not getting past me without a ticket.
01:33:59.175,01:34:01.428,We're not here to see the show.
01:34:01.470,01:34:03.637,We have a situation here.
01:34:03.679,01:34:05.807,I am the principal of Horace Green.
01:34:05.848,01:34:07.850,We had a field trip that went awry.
01:34:07.892,01:34:09.852,"Some lunatic has kidnapped our kids, all right?"
01:34:09.894,01:34:11.313,Our kids are in there.
01:34:11.354,01:34:12.772,"Look, you guys are breaking my heart."
01:34:12.814,01:34:14.023,There's the ticket table.
01:34:14.065,01:34:16.568,"All right, maybe we should just get tickets."
01:34:16.610,01:34:18.278,"All right, let's get tickets."
01:34:22.031,01:34:24.284,Excuse me.
01:34:24.326,01:34:25.452,Excuse me. Excuse me.
01:34:25.494,01:34:26.453,Our kids are in here.
01:34:26.495,01:34:27.912,Quit pushing!
01:34:27.954,01:34:30.415,Excuse me.
01:34:32.750,01:34:35.044,Hey. What's up?
01:34:35.086,01:34:36.963,Uh...
01:34:37.005,01:34:38.006,Come on!
01:34:38.047,01:34:40.008,We're the School of Rock.
01:34:40.049,01:34:45.347,And this song was written by our own Zack Mooneyham.
01:36:10.473,01:36:11.433,Yeah!
01:38:17.016,01:38:19.893,Your son is very skilled.
01:38:19.935,01:38:21.730,Thanks. So's yours.
01:38:42.458,01:38:45.919,Take me back!
01:38:45.961,01:38:47.963,Whoa.
01:38:49.841,01:38:51.092,Yeah!
01:38:53.469,01:38:54.679,Yeah!
01:39:09.861,01:39:12.154,School of Rock!
01:39:12.196,01:39:15.742,Woo!
01:39:15.784,01:39:19.245,"Oh, sorry. To get in, you've got to be in a band or have a pass."
01:39:19.287,01:39:21.539,I am principal of the school's band.
01:39:21.581,01:39:22.707,"Oh, right on."
01:39:22.749,01:39:27.086,All right? All right?
01:39:27.128,01:39:30.172,That was incredible!
01:39:30.214,01:39:31.549,That was incredible.
01:39:31.591,01:39:35.344,"Oh, my gosh, the lights, and the guitar solos..."
01:39:35.386,01:39:37.305,Was it really you playing?
01:39:37.346,01:39:38.807,So you're not mad?
01:39:38.848,01:39:40.642,Mad? I'm furious.
01:39:40.683,01:39:44.186,"I'm horrified, but it was incredible."
01:39:44.228,01:39:45.605,It was so great.
01:39:45.647,01:39:47.106,You guys were so great.
01:39:48.691,01:39:49.943,Dude!
01:39:49.983,01:39:51.068,"You did it, man."
01:39:51.110,01:39:52.654,Those lights were awesome!
01:39:52.695,01:39:53.905,They were awesome.
01:39:53.947,01:39:55.490,These kids are incredible.
01:39:55.531,01:39:56.825,Amazing.

01:40:08.336,01:40:09.754,"No way, dude. How long you been playing man?"
01:40:09.796,01:40:11.088,About three years.
01:40:11.130,01:40:12.924,"I used to play classical, but now I play rock."
01:40:12.966,01:40:15.593,"Hey, you in a band?"
01:40:15.635,01:40:18.179,No. No.
01:40:18.220,01:40:23.977,"No, I am the principal of this school."
01:40:24.017,01:40:25.520,Yeah?
01:40:25.561,01:40:26.354,Yes.
01:40:26.395,01:40:27.730,"Wow, that's cool."
01:40:27.772,01:40:29.190,That's cool.
01:40:29.231,01:40:30.358,"Yes, yes it is."
01:40:30.399,01:40:33.695,"It's very, it's very cool."
01:40:33.736,01:40:34.654,Yeah.

01:40:35.571,01:40:36.698,It is very cool.
01:40:36.739,01:40:37.699,Do you? Yes.
01:40:37.740,01:40:39.617,"Yeah, you're hot."
01:40:39.659,01:40:40.702,What?
01:40:40.743,01:40:41.619,I'm sorry.
01:40:41.661,01:40:43.204,Are you warm?
01:40:46.457,01:40:49.042,"All right, guys, this is it."
01:40:49.084,01:40:50.211,The moment of truth.
01:40:50.252,01:40:54.382,The winner of this year's Battle of the Bands competition...
01:40:55.842,01:40:58.928,...is No Vacancy.
01:41:03.975,01:41:06.310,DEWEY: No! Boo!
01:41:06.352,01:41:07.645,It was a beauty contest.
01:41:07.687,01:41:09.856,They weren't even listening to the music.
01:41:09.898,01:41:10.982,Boo! No!
01:41:11.024,01:41:12.734,What?
01:41:14.067,01:41:17.070,"Oh, no."
01:41:17.112,01:41:23.411,"On behalf of the Battle of the Bands, I'd like to present this check for $20,000 to No Vacancy."
01:41:23.452,01:41:26.706,Yeah!
01:41:26.748,01:41:28.583,"No, School of Rock."
01:41:28.624,01:41:29.208,Come on!
01:41:29.250,01:41:30.251,School of Rock.
01:41:30.292,01:41:31.252,School of Rock!
01:41:31.293,01:41:33.004,School of Rock.
01:41:33.046,01:41:33.922,What's wrong?
01:41:33.963,01:41:35.130,DEWEY: What's wrong?
01:41:35.172,01:41:37.383,"Summer, didn't you hear?"
01:41:37.425,01:41:38.593,"Hey, chill out, dude."
01:41:38.634,01:41:40.386,Rock isn't about getting an A.
01:41:40.428,01:41:42.513,The Sex Pistols never won anything.
01:41:42.555,01:41:44.390,Don't let the man get you down.
01:41:44.432,01:41:46.935,"Yeah, I mean, dude, you got to cheer up."
01:41:46.976,01:41:47.977,We played a kick-ass show.
01:41:48.019,01:41:50.438,"We did, didn't we?"
01:41:50.479,01:41:52.941,"It was unbelievable, wasn't it?"
01:41:52.982,01:41:54.107,Yeah.
01:41:54.149,01:41:57.152,School of Rock! School of Rock!
01:41:57.194,01:41:58.446,School of Rock!
01:41:58.487,01:42:02.157,School of Rock!
01:42:02.199,01:42:04.619,School of Rock! School of Rock!
01:42:04.660,01:42:08.121,School of Rock!
01:42:08.163,01:42:09.040,School of Rock!
01:42:09.082,01:42:10.165,What is that?
01:42:10.207,01:42:12.794,School of Rock!
01:42:12.835,01:42:14.127,It's an encore.
01:42:14.169,01:42:16.213,They want us to go play another song.
01:42:16.255,01:42:17.632,"It's good! Go, you guys!"
01:42:17.673,01:42:19.467,"Wait, no, no."
01:42:19.508,01:42:20.676,"Okay, everybody, go!"
01:42:32.605,01:42:36.149,"Thank you, yes, we will play one more."
01:43:01.550,01:43:23.196,"Riding down the highway Bye, Mom."
01:43:23.238,01:43:25.033,I told you.
01:43:25.074,01:43:27.535,"As soon as I talk to the band, I'll get back to you."
01:43:27.576,01:43:31.204,"If you're so desperate, then quit low-balling us."
01:43:31.246,01:43:32.999,DEWEY: Mm-hmm.
01:43:33.041,01:43:34.249,Yeah.
01:43:34.291,01:43:37.336,Ah... mm-hmm.
01:43:37.378,01:43:39.047,Here we go.
01:43:55.270,01:43:56.898,Woo!
01:44:10.536,01:44:12.580,And that's a C.
01:44:12.621,01:44:14.289,All right? You got that?
01:44:14.331,01:44:15.917,Let's see.
01:44:15.958,01:44:20.379,"Yeah, you're fingers are... basically right."
01:44:20.421,01:44:22.048,"Shawn, what do you got?"
01:44:22.090,01:44:23.424,Let's see.
01:44:23.465,01:44:25.426,"Toby, you got it?"
01:44:25.467,01:44:26.594,Very good you guys.
01:44:47.198,01:44:50.618,"All right, now take it down nice and quiet."
01:44:50.659,01:44:54.872,The next thing I want to hear...
01:44:54.914,01:44:59.961,"is a face-melting solo by our own Zack Mooneyham, go."
01:45:00.002,01:45:01.754,Here we go!
01:45:07.009,01:45:09.637,Woo!
01:45:15.308,01:45:17.310,"Dude, is my face okay?"
01:45:17.352,01:45:19.188,I think you melted it off.
01:45:20.982,01:45:29.657,"All right, now the next thing I want to hear, the very next thing-- I don't want to hear anything unless I hear..."
01:45:29.698,01:45:34.829,"a gut-busting, drum solo from Freddy."
01:45:34.870,01:45:35.955,Take it away!
01:45:57.768,01:46:00.188,Aah! My gut got busted!
01:46:02.023,01:46:04.984,"What did you do, Freddy?"
01:46:07.736,01:46:14.035,"Now, I think it's time we heard from a little somebody."
01:46:15.536,01:46:19.040,"Lawrence on lead solo keyboard, go!"
01:46:32.261,01:46:33.846,Woo!
01:46:37.892,01:46:40.144,"All right, slow it up."
01:46:40.186,01:46:42.730,Here's what I need.
01:46:42.771,01:46:45.566,I need you girls to repeat after me.
01:46:59.454,01:47:00.873,All right.
01:47:00.915,01:47:03.292,Now the first test is over.
01:47:03.334,01:47:08.421,"I'm going to need Alicia to give me a two-second vocal solo, go."
01:47:08.463,01:47:09.924,Here it comes.
01:47:16.638,01:47:17.848,"Don't Bogart the mic, Alicia."
01:47:17.890,01:47:20.226,"That was beautiful, but now it's time."
01:47:20.268,01:47:21.810,"Come on, Tomika, melt it."
01:47:30.485,01:47:31.820,That was tasty.
01:47:31.862,01:47:35.241,"Marta, blow my brains out."
01:48:49.815,01:48:52.525,"All right, that's it, stop you guys, stop."
01:48:52.567,01:48:55.154,"Seriously, you guys."
01:48:55.196,01:48:57.031,"All right, take five."
01:48:59.241,01:49:01.369,Take five.
01:49:01.410,01:49:03.329,You want to go?
01:49:03.371,01:49:04.413,That was a good class.
01:49:04.455,01:49:06.290,"All right, see you, man."
