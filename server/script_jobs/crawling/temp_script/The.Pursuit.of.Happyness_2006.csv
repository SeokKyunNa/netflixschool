00:01:33.750,00:01:35.417,"Time to get up, man."
00:01:37.792,00:01:39.917,"All right, Dad."
00:02:47.458,00:02:49.041,Should be here soon.
00:02:49.083,00:03:39.709,MAN: I think I should make a list.
00:03:39.750,00:03:42.166,For your birthday gifts?
00:03:42.208,00:03:44.834,"Well, you know you're only getting a couple of things, right?"
00:03:44.875,00:03:45.792,"Yeah, I know."
00:03:45.834,00:03:49.333,"Just to look at and study, so I can choose better."
00:03:49.375,00:03:52.667,"Okay, well, that's smart."
00:03:52.709,00:03:54.792,Can you spell everything you're thinking of?
00:03:54.834,00:03:56.291,I think so.
00:03:56.333,00:03:58.792,All right.
00:04:02.417,00:04:04.458,"How you doing in here, man?"
00:04:04.500,00:04:05.625,Okay.
00:04:12.667,00:04:14.542,Can we go to the park today?
00:04:14.583,00:04:15.709,After?
00:04:15.750,00:04:17.709,"Um. No, I gotta go to Oakland."
00:04:17.750,00:04:19.792,"Well, uh..."
00:04:19.834,00:04:21.500,Give me a kiss.
00:04:22.458,00:04:24.250,I'll talk to you later.
00:04:27.834,00:04:28.792,Excuse me.
00:04:30.208,00:04:31.792,"Oh. Excuse me, uh..."
00:04:31.834,00:04:34.583,"when is, uh, somebody gonna clean this off?"
00:04:37.417,00:04:38.500,And-- And-- And the Y?
00:04:38.542,00:04:39.792,The Y. We talked about this.
00:04:39.834,00:04:41.667,It's an I in happiness.
00:04:41.709,00:04:43.583,There's no Y in happiness.
00:04:45.792,00:04:47.667,I'm Chris Gardner.
00:04:47.709,00:04:51.667,I met my father for the first time when I was 28 years old.
00:04:51.709,00:04:58.917,"And I made up my mind as a young kid that when I had children, my children were gonna know who their father was."
00:05:00.875,00:05:02.959,This is part of my life story.
00:05:04.417,00:05:07.750,This part is called Riding the Bus.
00:05:14.291,00:05:16.500,What's that?
00:05:16.542,00:05:18.792,"It's a time machine, isn't it?"
00:05:18.834,00:05:21.375,Seems like a time machine.
00:05:21.417,00:05:22.834,That seems like a time machine.
00:05:22.875,00:05:24.709,It's a time machine.
00:05:24.750,00:05:25.750,This machine...
00:05:25.792,00:05:27.750,This machine on my lap...
00:05:27.792,00:05:29.750,"HOMELESS MAN: This guy, he has a time machine."
00:05:29.792,00:05:31.834,He-- He-- He travels.
00:05:29.792,00:05:33.083,He travels in the past with this machine and...
00:05:33.125,00:05:35.542,...it is not a time machine.
00:05:35.583,00:05:38.625,It's a portable bone-density scanner.
00:05:38.667,00:05:42.208,A medical device I sell for a living.
00:05:42.250,00:05:45.250,Thank you for the opportunity to-- To discuss it with you.
00:05:45.291,00:05:47.250,I appreciate it.
00:05:47.291,00:05:49.166,It's unnecessary.
00:05:49.208,00:05:52.291,"Well, maybe next-- Thank you."
00:05:52.333,00:05:56.041,It gave a slightly denser picture than an x-ray...
00:05:56.083,00:05:57.750,for twice the money.
00:06:00.500,00:06:02.333,Hey.
00:06:02.375,00:06:04.125,What happened?
00:06:04.166,00:06:05.750,"Look, I can't get Christopher today."
00:06:05.792,00:06:07.792,"Oh, no, you don't, Chris."
00:06:05.792,00:06:09.000,I need-- I'm back on at 7.
00:06:09.041,00:06:10.750,I know. I have got to go to Oakland.
00:06:10.792,00:06:17.542,"So I gotta get Christopher home, feed him, bathe him, get him in bed, and be back here by 7?"
00:06:17.583,00:06:19.125,And we got the tax bill notice today.
00:06:19.166,00:06:20.667,What are you gonna do about that?
00:06:20.709,00:06:21.917,Look. This is what we gotta do.
00:06:26.792,00:06:28.375,You see that car?
00:06:28.417,00:06:31.375,The one with the pretty yellow shoe on it?
00:06:31.417,00:06:32.667,That's mine.
00:06:32.709,00:06:34.959,There's no parking near hospitals.
00:06:35.000,00:06:37.750,That's what happens when you're always in a rush.
00:06:37.792,00:06:39.792,Thanks anyway.
00:06:39.834,00:06:41.917,"Uh-- Uh, maybe next quarter."
00:06:43.667,00:06:50.083,I needed to sell at least two scanners a month for rent and daycare.
00:06:50.125,00:06:55.458,I'd have to sell one more to pay off all of those tickets under my windshield wiper.
00:07:01.792,00:07:05.250,The problem is...
00:07:05.291,00:07:06.917,I haven't sold any for a while.
00:07:09.375,00:07:12.291,Since when do you not like macaroni and cheese?
00:07:12.333,00:07:14.333,CHRISTOPHER: Since birth?
00:07:17.250,00:07:19.625,What's that?
00:07:19.667,00:07:21.333,What is this?
00:07:21.375,00:07:22.709,It's a gift for Christopher.
00:07:22.750,00:07:25.542,From who?
00:07:25.583,00:07:26.834,It's for adults.
00:07:26.875,00:07:28.750,She didn't know.
00:07:28.792,00:07:31.542,What are you supposed to do with it?
00:07:31.583,00:07:34.583,Make every side the same color.
00:07:35.458,00:07:38.500,Did you pay the taxes?
00:07:38.542,00:07:42.417,"No, I'm gonna have to, uh, file an extension."
00:07:42.458,00:07:44.166,You already filed an extension.
00:07:44.208,00:07:46.709,"Yeah, well, I gotta file another one."
00:07:46.750,00:07:48.500,That's-- It's $650.
00:07:48.542,00:07:49.917,I'll have it in the next month.
00:07:51.166,00:07:53.083,"That means interest, right?"
00:07:53.125,00:07:55.709,And a penalty?
00:07:55.750,00:07:58.041,"Look, why don't you let me do this?"
00:07:58.083,00:08:01.667,"All right, just relax."
00:08:01.709,00:08:03.500,"Now, come here."
00:08:03.542,00:08:05.917,I have to go back to work.
00:08:13.875,00:08:14.959,Let's get ready for bed.
00:08:15.000,00:08:18.000,"Hey, uh, put your plate in the sink."
00:08:18.041,00:08:21.208,A few days ago I was presented with a report I'd asked for.
00:08:21.250,00:08:25.709,"A comprehensive audit, if you will, of our economic condition."
00:08:25.750,00:08:28.667,You won't like it.
00:08:28.709,00:08:33.250,But we have to face the truth and then go to work to turn things around.
00:08:33.291,00:08:34.750,And make no mistake about it...
00:08:34.792,00:08:37.250,we can turn them around.
00:08:37.291,00:08:40.625,The federal budget is out of control.
00:08:40.667,00:08:47.750,And we face runaway deficits of almost $80 billion for this budget year that ends September 30th.
00:08:47.792,00:08:51.667,That deficit is larger than the entire federal budget in 1957.
00:08:53.208,00:09:00.834,And so is the almost $80 billion we will pay in interest this year on the national debt.
00:09:00.875,00:09:07.750,"Twenty years ago, in 1960, our federal government payroll was less than $13 billion."
00:09:07.792,00:09:10.750,Today it is 75 billion.
00:09:10.792,00:09:16.750,"During these 20 years, our population has only increased by 23.3 percent..."
00:09:33.875,00:09:35.792,Woo! Man.
00:09:35.834,00:09:39.792,I got two questions for you: What do you do?
00:09:42.333,00:09:43.333,I'm a stockbroker.
00:09:43.375,00:09:45.625,Stockbroker.
00:09:45.667,00:09:47.792,"Had to go to college to be a stockbroker, huh?"
00:09:47.834,00:09:48.834,You don't have to.
00:09:48.875,00:09:51.709,Had to be good with numbers and good with people.
00:09:51.750,00:09:54.250,That's it.
00:09:54.291,00:09:56.542,Hey. I'm gonna let you hang on to my car for the weekend.
00:09:56.583,00:09:58.834,But I need it back for Monday.
00:10:06.166,00:10:08.917,I still remember that moment.
00:10:12.792,00:10:15.542,They all looked so...
00:10:15.583,00:10:17.917,damn happy to me.
00:10:24.875,00:10:27.417,Why couldn't I look like that?
00:10:44.834,00:10:46.250,I'm gonna try to get home by 6.
00:10:46.291,00:10:49.625,"I'm, uh, gonna stop by a brokerage firm after work."
00:10:49.667,00:10:50.667,For what?
00:10:50.709,00:10:52.792,I wanna see about a job there.
00:10:52.834,00:10:54.917,Yeah? What job?
00:10:56.250,00:11:01.458,"Uh, you know, when I-- When I was a kid, I could go through a-- A math book in a week."
00:11:01.500,00:11:04.667,"So I'm gonna go see about, uh, a job they got down there."
00:11:04.709,00:11:05.792,Oh.
00:11:05.834,00:11:07.417,What job?
00:11:10.792,00:11:12.125,Stockbroker.
00:11:12.166,00:11:16.458,IN BACKGROUND Stockbroker?
00:11:16.500,00:11:18.250,Yeah.
00:11:18.291,00:11:20.417,Not an astronaut?
00:11:37.250,00:11:38.709,"Don't talk to me like that, Linda."
00:11:38.750,00:11:43.709,"I'm gonna go down to see about this, and I'm gonna do it during the day."
00:11:43.750,00:11:45.750,You should probably do your sales calls.
00:11:45.792,00:11:48.750,"I don't need you to tell me about my sales calls, Linda."
00:11:48.792,00:11:51.667,I got three of 'em before the damn office is even open.
00:11:51.709,00:11:54.792,Do you remember that rent is due next week?
00:11:54.834,00:11:57.542,Probably not.
00:11:57.583,00:11:59.792,We're already two months behind.
00:11:59.834,00:12:02.750,Next-- Next week we'll owe three months.
00:12:02.792,00:12:07.834,"I've been pulling double shifts for-- For four months now, Chris."
00:12:07.875,00:12:10.792,Just-- Just sell what's in your contract.
00:12:10.834,00:12:12.375,Get us out of that business.
00:12:12.417,00:12:16.250,Linda. That is what I am trying to do.
00:12:16.291,00:12:19.750,This is what I'm trying to do for my family.
00:12:19.792,00:12:22.542,For you and for Christopher.
00:12:22.583,00:12:24.917,What's the matter with you?
00:12:28.834,00:12:29.917,Linda.
00:12:30.834,00:12:31.834,Linda.
00:12:49.250,00:13:03.208,WOMAN: CHRIS: This part of my life is called...
00:13:03.250,00:13:04.709,Being Stupid.
00:13:06.750,00:13:08.208,"Can I ask you a favor, miss?"
00:13:08.250,00:13:12.291,"Do you mind...if I leave this here with you, um, just for five minutes?"
00:13:12.333,00:13:16.208,"I have a meeting in there, and I don't wanna carry that in there looking smalltime."
00:13:16.250,00:13:17.792,Um...
00:13:17.834,00:13:19.709,here is a dollar.
00:13:19.750,00:13:22.542,And...I'll give you more money when I come back out.
00:13:22.583,00:13:24.542,"Okay. Um, it's not valuable."
00:13:24.583,00:13:26.166,You can't sell it anywhere.
00:13:26.208,00:13:29.333,"Um, I-I can't even sell it, and it's my job."
00:13:29.375,00:13:32.750,All right?
00:13:38.250,00:13:39.500,Chris?
00:13:39.542,00:13:41.041,"Tim Brophy, Resources."
00:13:41.083,00:13:42.709,Come with me.
00:13:42.750,00:13:45.875,Let me see if I can find you an application for our internship.
00:13:45.917,00:13:47.542,I'm afraid that's all we can do for you.
00:13:47.583,00:13:48.792,"See, this is a satellite office."
00:13:48.834,00:13:51.959,"Jay Twistle in the main office, he oversees Witter Resources."
00:13:52.000,00:13:54.208,"I mean, I'm-- You know, I'm just this office."
00:13:54.250,00:13:57.333,"As you can see, we got a hell of a lot of applications here..."
00:13:57.375,00:14:00.667,"Normally I have a resume sheet, but I can't seem to find it anywhere."
00:14:00.709,00:14:04.291,"W-we, uh... Uh..."
00:14:04.333,00:14:05.750,I need to go. Um...
00:14:05.792,00:14:07.917,I'll-- I'll br-- I'll bring this back.
00:14:07.959,00:14:09.542,Thank you.
00:14:09.583,00:14:10.917,Okay.
00:14:17.333,00:14:21.208,CHRIS: Trusting a hippie girl with my scanner.
00:14:21.250,00:14:23.625,Why did I do that?
00:14:23.667,00:14:29.500,"Like I said, this part of my life is called Being Stupid."
00:14:32.667,00:14:33.959,Hey! Hey!
00:14:34.000,00:14:36.917,Hey! Don't move!
00:14:45.333,00:14:47.750,Stop! Stop!
00:14:47.792,00:14:50.917,Don't move! Stop this--!
00:14:51.875,00:14:54.375,Stop! Stop!
00:15:09.333,00:15:13.250,The program took just 20 people every six months.
00:15:13.291,00:15:15.458,One got the job.
00:15:15.500,00:15:21.917,There were three blank lines after high school to...list more education.
00:15:23.875,00:15:26.375,I didn't need that many lines.
00:15:31.750,00:15:34.709,Try and sleep.
00:15:44.667,00:15:53.709,"It's a puzzle measuring just three inches by three inches on each side, made up of multiple colors that you twist and turn, and try to get to a solid color on each side."
00:15:53.750,00:15:57.750,This little cube is the gift sensation of 1981.
00:15:57.792,00:15:59.417,Don't expect to solve it easily.
00:15:59.458,00:16:04.625,Although we did encounter one math professor at USF who took just 30 minutes on his.
00:16:04.667,00:16:07.125,This is as far as I've gotten on mine.
00:16:07.166,00:16:10.750,"As you can see, I still have a long way to go."
00:16:10.792,00:16:13.625,This is Jim Finnerty reporting for KJSF in Richmond.
00:16:13.667,00:16:14.792,Hey.
00:16:14.834,00:16:16.500,Wake up.
00:16:16.542,00:16:18.667,Eat.

00:16:19.917,00:16:21.792,"Bye, baby."
00:16:21.834,00:16:23.709,"Come back without that, please."
00:16:23.750,00:16:24.917,"Oh. Yeah, I'm going to."
00:16:24.959,00:16:27.834,"So go ahead, say goodbye to it, 'cause I'm coming back without it."
00:16:27.875,00:16:30.792,Goodbye and good riddance.
00:16:30.834,00:16:32.834,You ain't had to add the good riddance part.
00:16:32.875,00:16:33.959,"Bye, Mom."
00:16:35.500,00:16:36.709,Bye.

00:16:40.834,00:16:42.000,Is it an adjective?
00:16:42.041,00:16:44.083,"Uh, no. Actually, it's a noun."
00:16:44.125,00:16:45.792,But it's not spelled right.
00:16:45.834,00:16:48.583,Is fuck spelled right?
00:16:48.625,00:16:49.834,"Yeah, that's spelled right."
00:16:49.875,00:16:53.166,"But that's not part of the motto, so you're not supposed to learn that."
00:16:53.208,00:16:58.250,"That's an adult word to show anger and, um...other things."
00:16:58.291,00:17:00.125,"But just don't-- Don't use that one, okay?"
00:17:00.166,00:17:01.709,Okay.
00:17:01.750,00:17:03.208,What's that say on the back of your bag?
00:17:03.250,00:17:05.834,My nickname.
00:17:05.875,00:17:07.709,We pick nicknames.
00:17:07.750,00:17:09.333,"Oh, yeah?"
00:17:09.375,00:17:10.709,Hot Rod.
00:17:14.291,00:17:16.500,Did you have a nickname?
00:17:16.542,00:17:19.375,What?
00:17:19.417,00:17:20.709,Heh-heh.
00:17:20.750,00:17:22.542,"I grew up in Louisiana, near Texas."
00:17:22.583,00:17:27.375,So everybody wears cowboy hats. And a-- A ten-gallon's a big hat.
00:17:27.417,00:17:31.542,"I was smart back then, so they called me Ten-Gallon Head."
00:17:31.583,00:17:33.792,Hoss wears that hat.
00:17:33.834,00:17:35.709,Hoss Cartwright on Bonanza.
00:17:35.750,00:17:37.792,How do you know Bonanza?
00:17:37.834,00:17:39.625,We watch it at Mrs. Chu's.
00:17:39.667,00:17:42.166,You watch Bonanza at daycare?
00:17:42.208,00:17:43.667,Yeah.
00:17:43.709,00:17:46.750,When? When do--?
00:17:46.792,00:17:48.792,After snack?
00:17:48.834,00:17:50.750,After Love Boat.
00:17:55.375,00:17:57.667,I made my list for my birthday.
00:17:57.709,00:17:59.834,"Yeah, what'd you--?"
00:17:59.875,00:18:01.458,A basketball...
00:18:01.500,00:18:02.917,or an ant farm.
00:18:06.417,00:18:07.750,He says he's been watching TV.
00:18:07.792,00:18:11.792,"Oh, little TV for history."
00:18:11.834,00:18:14.792,For history. Navy.
00:18:14.834,00:18:16.792,That's-- That's not the Navy.
00:18:16.834,00:18:18.709,"I mean, he-- He could watch television at home."
00:18:18.750,00:18:21.709,We're paying you $150 a month.
00:18:21.750,00:18:26.166,"I-if he's gonna be sitting around watching TV all day, we're taking him out of here."
00:18:26.208,00:18:29.917,Go pay more at other daycare if you don't like Navy TV.
00:18:31.792,00:18:35.125,You late pay anyway.
00:18:35.166,00:18:36.917,I complain.
00:18:38.667,00:18:42.625,Can you at least put the dog upstairs in you room or something?
00:18:42.667,00:18:43.917,Bye.
00:19:28.375,00:19:29.750,CHRIS: I was waiting for...
00:19:29.792,00:19:38.250,"Witter Resource head, Jay Twistle, whose name sounded so delightful, like he'd give me a job and a hug."
00:19:38.291,00:19:42.417,I just had to show him I was good with numbers and good with people.
00:19:42.458,00:19:44.083,"Morning, Mr. Twistle."
00:19:44.125,00:19:45.792,Mr. Twistle. Chris Gardner.
00:19:45.834,00:19:48.917,I wanted to drop this off personally and make your acquaintance.
00:19:48.959,00:19:50.500,I thought I'd catch you on the way in.
00:19:50.542,00:19:54.709,I'd really love the opportunity to sit and discuss what may seem like weaknesses on my application.
00:19:54.750,00:19:57.750,"We'll start with this, Chris, and we'll call you if we wanna sit down."
00:19:57.792,00:20:00.667,"Yes, sir. You have a great day."
00:20:07.333,00:20:09.458,"CHRIS: Hey. Uh, yeah, how you doing?"
00:20:09.500,00:20:11.709,This is Chris Gardner calling for Dr. Delsey.
00:20:11.750,00:20:14.041,"Uh, yeah, look, I'm running a little late for a sales call."
00:20:14.083,00:20:17.709,"I was-- I was wondering if-- Yeah, Osteo National."
00:20:17.750,00:20:20.625,"Right. Uh, we can still--?"
00:20:20.667,00:20:23.917,Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful.
00:20:33.875,00:20:36.125,Hey! Hey!
00:20:38.375,00:20:39.792,Hey!
00:20:39.834,00:20:41.125,CHRIS: This part of my life...
00:20:41.166,00:20:42.083,Wait!
00:20:42.125,00:20:45.667,This part here...
00:20:45.709,00:20:47.792,it's called Running.
00:20:47.834,00:20:49.750,Hey! Hey!
00:20:49.792,00:20:51.792,Wait!
00:20:51.834,00:20:54.667,Hey! Wait!
00:20:54.709,00:20:57.333,That was my stolen machine.
00:20:57.375,00:20:59.917,Unless she was with a guy who sold them too.
00:21:01.125,00:21:02.875,Which was unlikely...
00:21:02.917,00:21:05.458,because I was the only one selling them in the Bay Area.
00:21:05.500,00:21:08.709,I spent our entire life savings on these things.
00:21:10.709,00:21:12.208,It was such a revolutionary machine.
00:21:12.250,00:21:15.125,Ooh.
00:21:15.166,00:21:16.667,"Can you feel it, baby?"
00:21:16.709,00:21:18.458,"Oh, yeah. You got me doing all the work."
00:21:18.500,00:21:24.667,What I didn't know is that doctors and hospitals would consider them unnecessary luxuries.
00:21:27.667,00:21:30.750,I even asked the landlord to take a picture.
00:21:32.166,00:21:36.917,"So if I lost one, it was like losing a month's groceries."
00:21:40.792,00:21:43.291,"Hey, hey! Wait! Wait!"
00:21:46.834,00:21:48.458,BUS DRIVER: Hey! Get back here!
00:21:53.208,00:21:54.750,"Hey, man, uh..."
00:21:54.792,00:22:00.750,"Uh, I-- Uh-- Who's he?"
00:22:10.625,00:22:12.083,CHRISTOPHER: Did you forget?
00:22:12.125,00:22:15.417,Forget what?
00:22:15.458,00:22:18.291,You're not supposed to have any of those.
00:22:18.333,00:22:19.625,"Yeah, I know."
00:22:19.667,00:22:21.834,You have two now.
00:22:31.667,00:22:33.709,Hey.
00:22:35.875,00:22:37.959,"Hey, Mom."
00:22:42.625,00:22:44.750,CHRIS: One...
00:22:44.792,00:22:45.834,two...
00:22:45.875,00:22:46.792,...three!
00:22:46.834,00:22:47.834,BOTH: Whoo!
00:22:47.875,00:22:49.834,That's a basketball!
00:22:49.875,00:22:51.709,"Hey, hey."
00:22:51.750,00:22:53.667,You don't know that that's a basketball.
00:22:53.709,00:22:55.250,This could be an ant farm.
00:22:55.291,00:22:57.667,This-- This could be a-- A microscope or anything.
00:22:57.709,00:22:58.625,"No, it's not."
00:22:58.667,00:23:00.458,"There, there."
00:23:00.500,00:23:02.917,"All right, come on."
00:23:09.166,00:23:11.375,"CHRIS: That paper's a little heavy, huh?"
00:23:11.417,00:23:14.709,"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, but I got it."
00:23:24.750,00:23:27.625,"Yeah, you should've seen me out there today. Uh..."
00:23:27.667,00:23:30.291,"Somebody, uh, stole a scanner."
00:23:27.667,00:23:31.875,I had to run the old girl down-- Whatever.
00:23:33.709,00:23:37.625,What?
00:23:37.667,00:23:39.417,What the hell you got attitude about?
00:23:39.458,00:23:40.667,Whatever what?
00:23:40.709,00:23:42.291,Every day's got some damn story.
00:23:42.333,00:23:43.917,"Hey, hey, Roy."
00:23:43.959,00:23:46.125,Can you beat your little rug when nobody's out here?
00:23:46.166,00:23:47.709,There's dust and shit all over.
00:23:47.750,00:23:49.125,I'm trying to keep a clean house.
00:23:49.166,00:23:50.750,"Hey, wait a second."
00:23:50.792,00:23:53.333,Listen.
00:23:53.375,00:23:54.792,We're gonna come out of this.
00:23:54.834,00:23:56.750,"Everything is gonna be fine, all right?"
00:23:58.500,00:24:02.417,"You said that before, when I got pregnant. It'll be fine."
00:24:02.458,00:24:03.709,So you don't trust me now?
00:24:03.750,00:24:06.917,Whatever.
00:24:22.208,00:24:24.750,Taxi!
00:24:24.792,00:24:27.709,"Yeah, hi."
00:24:27.750,00:24:29.750,"Yeah, hi. Listen."
00:24:29.792,00:24:37.750,"I submitted an application for the intern program about a month ago, and I would just love to sit with you briefly-- Listen, I'm going to Noe Valley, Chris."
00:24:37.792,00:24:38.792,"Uh, take care of yourself."
00:24:38.834,00:24:41.166,Mr. Twistle.
00:24:41.208,00:24:43.709,"Actually, I'm on my way to Noe Valley also."
00:24:43.750,00:24:46.709,Uh...how about we share a ride?
00:24:46.750,00:24:49.375,"All right, get in."
00:24:55.458,00:25:01.333,"So when I was in the Navy, I worked for a doctor who loved to play golf, hour-- Hours every day."
00:25:01.375,00:25:03.834,And...I would actually...
00:25:03.875,00:25:07.500,perform medical procedures when he'd leave me in the office.
00:25:07.542,00:25:14.291,So...I'm-- I'm used to being in a position where-- Where I have to make decisions and...
00:25:14.333,00:25:20.625,"Mr. Twistle. Listen, this is-- This is a very important-- I-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Uh."
00:25:21.792,00:25:24.500,I can do it.
00:25:24.542,00:25:27.291,That's bullshit.
00:25:27.333,00:25:28.792,"Mm. No, you can't."
00:25:28.834,00:25:30.834,Let me see it.
00:25:30.875,00:25:32.917,Give it here.
00:25:35.583,00:25:36.792,"Oh, yeah. Oh."
00:25:36.834,00:25:39.542,"Wow, you-- You, uh, really messed it up."
00:25:39.583,00:25:41.166,Heh. Sorry.
00:25:41.208,00:25:48.250,"Uh...it-- It looks like it-- It, uh, works around a swivel, so the center pieces never move."
00:25:48.291,00:25:51.583,"So if it's yellow in the center, that's the yellow side."
00:25:51.625,00:25:53.750,"If it's red in the center, that's the...red side."
00:25:53.792,00:25:55.792,Okay.
00:25:55.834,00:25:57.709,You-- You can slow down.
00:25:57.750,00:25:59.709,"Uh, listen, we can drive around all day."
00:25:59.750,00:26:01.417,I don't believe you can do this.
00:26:01.458,00:26:02.709,"Uh, yeah, I can."
00:26:02.750,00:26:04.500,"Yes, I can."
00:26:04.542,00:26:06.625,"I'm telling you, no one can. It's tough."
00:26:08.667,00:26:09.834,See? That's all I ever do.
00:26:10.834,00:26:24.917,"Uh, uh, uh-- Y-you almost have this side."
00:26:26.250,00:26:28.291,Holy cow.
00:26:36.750,00:26:39.917,"Oh. Oh, you almost had that one."
00:26:40.834,00:26:42.291,I'm gonna get it.
00:26:48.792,00:26:51.458,Look at that.
00:27:14.500,00:27:15.917,You're almost there.
00:27:38.792,00:27:40.792,CAB DRIVER: 17.10.
00:27:40.834,00:27:42.667,"Oh, this is me."
00:27:44.834,00:27:46.917,Good job.
00:27:48.500,00:27:49.625,Goodbye.
00:27:49.667,00:27:51.917,Yeah. I'll see-- See you soon.
00:27:53.333,00:27:55.834,"Uh, where are you going, sir?"
00:27:55.875,00:27:57.792,"Excuse me, sir."
00:27:57.834,00:27:59.250,"Where are you going, please?"
00:27:59.291,00:28:01.375,Uh-- Um...
00:28:01.417,00:28:03.750,"Uh, two-- A couple blocks."
00:28:03.792,00:28:05.792,"Just, you know, flip around."
00:28:05.834,00:28:07.917,Okay.
00:28:49.291,00:28:51.750,Hey! Stop it! Hey!
00:28:51.792,00:28:53.458,Where are you going?!
00:28:53.500,00:28:55.750,No! No!
00:28:55.792,00:28:58.291,Hey! You asshole. Give me my money! Give me my money.
00:28:58.333,00:29:00.417,Please stop.
00:29:00.458,00:29:01.667,Son of a bitch.
00:29:01.709,00:29:02.792,Please! He should've paid you!
00:29:02.834,00:29:04.625,He should've paid you!
00:29:04.667,00:29:06.125,I'm sorry.
00:29:06.166,00:29:07.792,I'm so sorry.
00:29:07.834,00:29:09.834,I'm sorry!
00:29:09.875,00:29:11.542,Idiot.
00:29:21.834,00:29:23.542,I'll get you!
00:29:23.583,00:29:27.333,I'm going to kill you!
00:29:42.417,00:29:44.542,Hey!
00:29:44.583,00:29:47.667,"Stop it, you son of a bitch!"
00:29:47.709,00:29:49.208,Stop him!
00:29:53.792,00:29:54.917,Stop him!
00:30:00.750,00:30:02.625,MAN: The doors are closing.
00:30:02.667,00:30:05.917,Please stand clear of the doors.
00:30:14.500,00:30:15.834,No! No! No!
00:30:19.458,00:30:21.375,No!
00:30:43.625,00:30:45.375,LINDA: Hello?
00:30:45.417,00:30:46.875,Hey. Yeah.
00:30:46.917,00:30:48.750,Sorry-- Sorry I couldn't make it home on time.
00:30:48.792,00:30:51.000,Chris. I missed my shift.
00:30:51.041,00:30:53.458,"Yeah, I-- I know."
00:30:53.500,00:30:54.792,"Look, um...I'm on my way right now."
00:30:54.834,00:30:56.542,Are you all right with Christopher?
00:30:56.583,00:30:59.500,I'm leaving.
00:30:59.542,00:31:01.709,What?
00:31:01.750,00:31:06.208,"I have my things together, and I'm taking our son..."
00:31:06.250,00:31:08.166,and we're gonna leave now.
00:31:08.208,00:31:09.750,I'm gonna put the phone down...
00:31:09.792,00:31:11.667,Linda. Wait a minute.
00:31:09.792,00:31:12.750,Hold it-- Hold-- We are leaving.
00:31:18.667,00:31:23.667,CHRIS: It was right then that I started thinking about Thomas Jefferson...
00:31:23.709,00:31:26.458,...and the Declaration of Independence...
00:31:26.500,00:31:32.667,"and the part about our right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
00:31:32.709,00:31:36.000,And I remember thinking: How did he know...
00:31:36.041,00:31:39.583,to put the pursuit part in there?
00:31:39.625,00:31:43.625,That maybe happiness is something that we can only pursue.
00:31:43.667,00:31:47.792,And maybe we can actually never have it...
00:31:47.834,00:31:49.458,no matter what.
00:31:49.500,00:31:51.834,How did he know that?
00:31:56.333,00:31:59.417,Linda. Linda.
00:32:32.083,00:32:33.709,Hello?
00:32:33.750,00:32:36.667,Who is this?
00:32:36.709,00:32:39.500,Uh-- Hey.
00:32:39.542,00:32:42.417,"Yeah, of course. Uh-- Uh...how are you?"
00:32:42.458,00:32:44.834,"I'm fine. Listen, do you still wanna come in and talk?"
00:32:44.875,00:32:46.583,"Yes, sir. Absolutely."
00:32:46.625,00:32:48.375,I'll tell you what.
00:32:46.625,00:32:49.709,"Come on by day after tomorrow, in the morning."
00:32:49.750,00:32:51.667,We're interviewing for the internships.
00:32:51.709,00:32:52.792,You got a pen and paper?
00:32:52.834,00:32:55.583,"Uh. Yes. Uh, yes, I do."
00:32:55.625,00:32:59.208,Um... Uh. Hold on one second.
00:32:59.250,00:33:01.375,All right.
00:33:04.834,00:33:06.750,Hello?
00:33:06.792,00:33:08.333,Chris?
00:33:08.375,00:33:09.667,"Uh-- Uh, go ahead. I have one."
00:33:09.709,00:33:14.417,"Write this number down so you can call my secretary, Janice, and she can give you all the specifics."
00:33:14.458,00:33:15.834,Yep.
00:33:15.875,00:33:17.041,415.
00:33:17.083,00:33:18.667,864.
00:33:18.709,00:33:21.083,0256.
00:33:21.125,00:33:24.333,"Yeah, extension 4796."
00:33:24.375,00:33:28.625,Right. Call her tomorrow.
00:33:28.667,00:33:30.333,"Okay, buddy."
00:33:30.375,00:33:32.792,Thank you very much.
00:33:32.834,00:33:36.458,864-0256.
00:33:36.500,00:33:39.917,4796. Janice.
00:33:42.834,00:33:44.750,Chris.
00:33:44.792,00:33:47.667,"Did you, uh...? Have you seen, uh, Linda and Christopher?"
00:33:47.709,00:33:49.083,No. You catch the game last night?
00:33:49.125,00:33:51.333,"No, no."
00:33:49.125,00:33:53.709,"You didn't see that, 118-1-- One-- Excuse me, did, uh, Linda and Christopher come in here?"
00:33:53.750,00:33:57.750,"No, I haven't see them."
00:33:57.792,00:33:59.792,"Moons hits a three-pointer, 17 seconds left."
00:33:59.834,00:34:01.709,"Wayne, Wayne, Wayne."
00:34:01.750,00:34:03.542,Can't talk to you about numbers right now.
00:34:03.583,00:34:05.250,What's your problem with numbers?
00:34:05.291,00:34:07.458,8642.
00:34:07.500,00:34:08.834,And you owe me money.
00:34:08.875,00:34:10.709,You owe me $14.
00:34:10.750,00:34:13.417,I'm gonna get that to you.
00:34:13.458,00:34:14.917,I need my money.
00:34:16.875,00:34:19.291,Fourteen's a number.
00:34:45.208,00:34:49.041,Hey. Don't you ever take my son away from me again.
00:34:49.083,00:34:50.542,Do you hear me?
00:34:50.583,00:34:52.250,Don't take my son away from me again.
00:34:52.291,00:34:54.166,Do you understand what I'm saying to you?
00:34:54.208,00:34:56.417,Don't you walk away from me when I'm talking to you.
00:34:56.458,00:34:57.709,Do you hear me?
00:34:57.750,00:34:59.667,Do you wanna leave?
00:34:59.709,00:35:01.917,You wanna leave?
00:35:03.667,00:35:05.792,"Get the hell out of here, then, Linda."
00:35:05.834,00:35:07.291,Get the hell out of here.
00:35:07.333,00:35:08.792,Christopher's staying with me.
00:35:08.834,00:35:11.208,You're the one that dragged us down. You hear me?
00:35:11.250,00:35:14.583,You are so weak-- No. I am not happy anymore.
00:35:14.625,00:35:17.458,I'm just not happy!
00:35:17.500,00:35:18.709,Just go get happy.
00:35:18.750,00:35:21.166,But Christopher's living with me!
00:35:21.208,00:35:23.375,Stop!
00:35:23.417,00:35:25.917,Christopher's living with me!
00:35:51.750,00:35:54.792,Hey. Come-- Come on.
00:35:54.834,00:35:57.917,"How you doing, Mrs. Chu?"
00:36:00.917,00:36:02.000,Where's Mom?
00:36:02.041,00:36:03.792,"Look, just get-- Get your stuff."
00:36:03.834,00:36:07.500,But she told me she was coming to pick me up today.
00:36:07.542,00:36:08.792,"Uh-- Yeah, I know."
00:36:08.834,00:36:12.417,Um...I talked to Mom earlier.
00:36:12.458,00:36:14.583,"Everything is fine, okay?"
00:36:21.333,00:36:22.709,Where do I sleep tonight?
00:36:22.750,00:36:25.041,Let me ask you something.
00:36:25.083,00:36:27.750,Yeah.
00:36:27.792,00:36:31.750,"And if you're happy and I'm happy, then that's a good thing, right?"
00:36:31.792,00:36:33.709,Yeah.
00:36:33.750,00:36:35.709,You're s-- You're sleeping with me.
00:36:35.750,00:36:39.792,"You're staying at home, uh, where you-- Where you belong, all right?"
00:36:39.834,00:36:45.834,Uh-- Come on.
00:36:54.917,00:36:56.625,Christopher.
00:37:14.500,00:37:17.166,"Hey. Listen, I need the rent."
00:37:17.208,00:37:18.709,I can't wait anymore.
00:37:18.750,00:37:19.792,"Yeah, uh-- I'm good for that, Charlie."
00:37:19.834,00:37:21.667,I'm gonna get it.
00:37:21.709,00:37:24.792,Why don't you go two blocks over at the Mission Inn motel?
00:37:24.834,00:37:26.792,It's half what you pay here.
00:37:26.834,00:37:29.500,"Listen, Chris. I need you out of here in the morning."
00:37:31.583,00:37:33.792,The hell am I supposed to be out of here tomorrow?
00:37:33.834,00:37:35.250,I got painters coming in.
00:37:35.291,00:37:36.792,"All right. All right, look."
00:37:36.834,00:37:38.291,No.
00:37:38.333,00:37:39.709,All right-- I'll paint it myself.
00:37:39.750,00:37:45.583,"All right, but I-- I just-- I gotta have some more time-- I got my son up in here."
00:37:49.875,00:37:51.709,All right.
00:37:51.750,00:37:55.291,One week.
00:38:46.792,00:38:47.959,Chris Gardner?
00:38:49.166,00:38:52.208,"Uh, yeah."
00:38:52.250,00:38:53.834,Payable to the City of San Francisco.
00:38:53.875,00:38:56.250,Does it have to be the-- The full amount?
00:38:56.291,00:38:57.792,"Well, you gotta pay each parking ticket."
00:38:57.834,00:38:59.792,"Otherwise, you're staying."
00:38:59.834,00:39:01.875,This is all I got.
00:39:06.208,00:39:09.792,You verify at 9:30 tomorrow morning.
00:39:09.834,00:39:11.125,What?
00:39:11.166,00:39:13.542,"Yeah, you gotta stay until this thing clears."
00:39:14.834,00:39:16.709,No.
00:39:16.750,00:39:19.166,"No, I-- I can't-- I can't spend the night here."
00:39:19.208,00:39:20.458,I-- I have to pick up my son.
00:39:20.500,00:39:21.875,You verify at 9:30 tomorrow.
00:39:21.917,00:39:26.750,Sir...I have a job interview at Dean Witter at 10:15 tomorrow morning.
00:39:26.792,00:39:28.625,I cannot stay-- 9:30 tomorrow morning.
00:39:28.667,00:39:30.166,What am I supposed to do with my son?
00:39:30.208,00:39:33.750,Is there anyone else who can--?
00:39:33.792,00:39:36.917,Maybe we can go and have Social Services pick him up.
00:39:40.709,00:39:44.834,"All right. Uh, can I make-- Have my phone call, please?"
00:39:47.333,00:39:48.709,Hello.
00:39:48.750,00:39:49.792,CHRIS: Hey.
00:39:49.834,00:39:51.333,What do you want?
00:39:51.375,00:39:53.041,Um...
00:39:53.083,00:39:55.333,"you gotta get Christopher, uh..."
00:39:55.375,00:39:56.792,from daycare.
00:39:56.834,00:39:58.750,I can't-- Um...
00:39:58.792,00:40:02.792,"Just keep him for the night, and I'm gonna-- I-- And, uh-- Just one night."
00:40:02.834,00:40:04.709,What happened?
00:40:04.750,00:40:08.709,"I'll pick him up from, uh, daycare...tomorrow."
00:40:08.750,00:40:11.917,"I'm gonna go right-- You can just-- You can drop him off, and I'll pick him up."
00:40:13.834,00:40:15.083,No.
00:40:15.125,00:40:16.667,"Come on, Linda."
00:40:16.709,00:40:18.375,Why you--?
00:40:18.417,00:40:21.792,No. I wanna take him to the park.
00:40:21.834,00:40:23.333,To Golden Gate...
00:40:23.375,00:40:24.917,after daycare tomorrow.
00:40:26.875,00:40:27.792,How is he?
00:40:27.834,00:40:29.417,He's fine.
00:40:29.458,00:40:34.583,"All right, just-- All right, take him to the park...and-- And...bring him back, all right?"
00:40:36.709,00:40:37.834,"All right, just..."
00:40:37.875,00:40:39.750,bring-- Bring me my son back.
00:40:39.792,00:40:42.750,Okay?
00:40:42.792,00:40:44.417,Linda?
00:40:44.458,00:40:46.667,I'll bring him back around 6.
00:40:48.250,00:40:49.834,All right. All right.
00:40:49.875,00:40:52.125,Uh...thank you.
00:40:52.166,00:40:53.792,Um...
00:40:53.834,00:40:54.834,All right.
00:40:54.875,00:40:55.917,Bye.
00:41:21.250,00:41:23.250,I'm okay?
00:41:57.834,00:42:00.542,Excuse me. Excuse me.
00:42:00.583,00:42:01.917,"Yes, I did."
00:42:10.834,00:42:12.667,Mr. Gardner.
00:42:19.625,00:42:21.500,This way.
00:42:23.709,00:42:24.917,It'll be right this way.
00:42:37.750,00:42:39.375,What is the word on that one?
00:43:00.834,00:43:01.917,Chris Gardner.
00:43:05.417,00:43:07.417,Chris Gardner.
00:43:07.458,00:43:09.750,How are you?
00:43:09.792,00:43:11.709,Chris Gardner.
00:43:11.750,00:43:13.750,Chris Gardner.
00:43:13.792,00:43:15.250,Chris Gardner.
00:43:17.792,00:43:24.792,I've been sitting there for the last half hour trying to come up with a story that would explain my being here dressed...
00:43:24.834,00:43:26.166,like this.
00:43:26.208,00:43:34.792,"And-- And I wanted to come up with a story that would demonstrate qualities that I'm sure you all admire here, like-- Like earnestness or diligence."
00:43:34.834,00:43:37.750,And team-playing.
00:43:37.792,00:43:40.500,And I couldn't think...
00:43:41.458,00:43:43.333,So the truth is...
00:43:43.375,00:43:46.166,I was arrested for failure to pay parking tickets.
00:43:46.208,00:43:47.250,Parking tickets?
00:43:47.291,00:43:48.875,What?
00:43:48.917,00:43:52.333,"And I ran all the way here from the-- The Polk Station, the police station."
00:43:52.375,00:43:54.583,What were you doing before you were arrested?
00:43:54.625,00:43:57.792,"I was, uh..."
00:43:57.834,00:43:58.917,Is it dry now?
00:44:00.750,00:44:01.875,Uh. I hope so.
00:44:01.917,00:44:03.792,Jay says you're pretty determined.
00:44:03.834,00:44:08.709,"Oh, he's been waiting outside the front of the building with some 40-pound gizmo for over a month."
00:44:08.750,00:44:10.709,He said you're smart.
00:44:10.750,00:44:12.500,"Well, I like to think so."
00:44:12.542,00:44:13.834,And you want to learn this business?
00:44:13.875,00:44:15.750,"Yes, sir, I wanna learn this business."
00:44:15.792,00:44:17.792,Have you already started learning on your own?
00:44:17.834,00:44:19.750,Absolutely.
00:44:19.792,00:44:22.375,Jay?
00:44:22.417,00:44:24.667,How many times have you seen Chris?
00:44:24.709,00:44:25.792,"JAY: Yeah, I don't know."
00:44:25.834,00:44:27.542,"One too many, apparently."
00:44:27.583,00:44:29.625,Was he ever dressed like this?
00:44:29.667,00:44:32.917,JAY: No. No. Jacket and tie.
00:44:34.625,00:44:37.750,First in your class in school?
00:44:37.792,00:44:39.750,High school?
00:44:39.792,00:44:41.834,How many in the class?
00:44:41.875,00:44:43.208,"Uh, 12."
00:44:43.250,00:44:44.208,It was a small town.
00:44:45.291,00:44:46.625,I'll say.
00:44:46.667,00:44:52.500,"But I was also first in my radar class in-- In the Navy, and that was a class of 20."
00:44:54.792,00:44:56.250,Can I say something?
00:44:56.291,00:44:59.625,Uh-- Um... I'm the type of person...
00:44:59.667,00:45:05.625,"if you ask me a question, and I don't know the answer, I'm gonna tell you that I don't know."
00:45:05.667,00:45:06.709,But I bet you what.
00:45:06.750,00:45:08.750,I know how to find the answer.
00:45:08.792,00:45:11.959,And I will find the answer.
00:45:13.333,00:45:14.917,Is that fair enough?
00:45:16.291,00:45:17.834,Chris.
00:45:18.792,00:45:24.875,What would you say if a guy walked in for an interview without a shirt on...
00:45:24.917,00:45:26.375,and I hired him?
00:45:26.417,00:45:27.667,What would you say?
00:45:31.834,00:45:35.458,He must've had on some really nice pants.
00:45:49.875,00:45:51.542,Chris...
00:45:51.583,00:45:54.792,"I don't know how you did it dressed as a garbage man, but you really pulled it off."
00:45:54.834,00:45:56.667,"Thank you very much, Mr. Twistle."
00:45:56.709,00:45:58.792,"Hey, now you can call me Jay."
00:45:58.834,00:46:02.458,"All right, so I'll let you know, Jay."
00:46:02.500,00:46:04.792,"You'll-- You'll let me know, Jay? What do you mean?"
00:46:04.834,00:46:09.583,Yeah. I'll give you a call tomorrow sometime-- What are you talking--?
00:46:09.625,00:46:12.834,You stood here-- Listen. There's no salary.
00:46:12.875,00:46:13.917,I was not aware of that.
00:46:13.959,00:46:19.917,"My circumstances have changed some, and I need to be certain that I'll be-- All right. Okay."
00:46:22.875,00:46:24.750,Tonight.
00:46:24.792,00:46:28.458,"I swear, I will fill your spot. I promise."
00:46:28.500,00:46:31.792,"If you back out, you know what I'll look like to the partners?"
00:46:31.834,00:46:34.875,Yes. An ass-- A-hole.
00:46:34.917,00:46:38.834,"Yeah, an ass A-hole, all the way."
00:46:41.166,00:46:43.917,You are a piece of work.
00:46:44.834,00:46:46.583,Tonight.
00:46:54.709,00:46:56.667,CHRIS: There was no salary.
00:46:56.709,00:46:59.917,Not even a reasonable promise of a job.
00:47:06.667,00:47:11.750,One intern was hired at the end of the program from a pool of 20.
00:47:11.792,00:47:17.834,"And if you weren't that guy, you couldn't even apply the six months' training to another brokerage."
00:47:19.959,00:47:24.375,Only resource I would have for six months would be my six scanners...
00:47:24.417,00:47:27.750,which I could still try to sell.
00:47:27.792,00:47:29.291,If I sold them all...
00:47:29.333,00:47:30.917,maybe we might get by.
00:48:17.834,00:48:19.333,I got him.
00:48:19.375,00:48:21.417,I got him.
00:48:21.458,00:48:22.917,All right.
00:48:29.333,00:48:31.333,"LINDA: Okay, baby."
00:48:43.875,00:48:44.917,I got it.
00:48:50.500,00:48:52.750,I'm going to New York.
00:48:59.250,00:49:00.375,Uh.
00:49:21.834,00:49:24.834,My sister's boyfriend...
00:49:24.875,00:49:29.125,"opened a restaurant, and they may have a job for me there, so..."
00:49:29.166,00:49:31.917,"I'm going to New York, Chris."
00:49:34.709,00:49:36.917,Christopher's staying with me.
00:49:43.583,00:49:46.458,I'm his mom. You know?
00:49:46.500,00:49:48.792,He should be with his mom.
00:49:48.834,00:49:50.709,"I should have him, right?"
00:49:50.750,00:49:52.917,You know you can't take care of him.
00:50:01.792,00:50:03.667,What are you gonna do for money?
00:50:05.542,00:50:06.917,I had an...
00:50:06.959,00:50:10.375,interview at Dean Witter for-- For an internship.
00:50:11.291,00:50:12.709,And I got it.
00:50:12.750,00:50:15.917,So I'm gonna stand out in my program.
00:50:17.166,00:50:19.542,Salesman to intern's backwards.
00:50:19.583,00:50:21.625,"No, it's not."
00:50:23.709,00:50:24.917,I gotta go.
00:50:58.750,00:51:00.500,"Tell him I love him, okay?"
00:51:01.834,00:51:03.667,And...
00:51:09.417,00:51:11.792,"I know you'll take care of him, Chris."
00:51:11.834,00:51:13.875,I know that.
00:51:55.750,00:51:57.166,WOMAN: Dean Witter.
00:51:57.208,00:51:58.750,Um...
00:51:58.792,00:52:02.208,"Yes, uh, I'd like to leave a message for-- For Mr. Jay Twistle."
00:52:02.250,00:52:03.542,Your name?
00:52:03.583,00:52:05.625,"Uh-- Yeah, my name is Chris Gardner."
00:52:05.667,00:52:12.709,"Uh-- Uh, the message is: Thank you very much for-- For inviting me into the program."
00:52:12.750,00:52:16.417,"Uh, I really appreciate it, and..."
00:52:16.458,00:52:19.250,I'd be very pleased to accept your invitation.
00:52:19.291,00:52:21.375,Is that all?
00:52:21.417,00:52:23.125,"Yes, that's-- That's it."
00:52:23.166,00:52:25.041,Okay.
00:52:25.083,00:52:26.917,Bye.
00:52:53.250,00:52:54.792,Be careful with that.
00:52:54.834,00:52:56.750,Be care-- Go ahead.
00:53:21.542,00:53:22.834,Are we there?
00:53:22.875,00:53:24.583,Yep.
00:53:37.750,00:53:39.709,Hey. You know what today is?
00:53:39.750,00:53:41.250,Yeah.
00:53:41.291,00:53:42.417,Saturday.
00:53:42.458,00:53:43.709,"You know what Saturday is, right?"
00:53:43.750,00:53:45.750,Yeah.
00:53:45.792,00:53:47.458,Basketball.
00:53:47.500,00:53:49.166,You wanna go play some basketball?
00:53:49.208,00:53:50.875,Okay.
00:53:50.917,00:53:53.250,All right. Then we're gonna go sell a bone density scanner.
00:53:53.291,00:53:54.625,How about that?
00:53:54.667,00:53:56.083,Wanna do that?
00:53:56.125,00:53:57.208,No.
00:53:59.667,00:54:01.333,"Hey, Dad, I'm going pro."
00:54:02.750,00:54:04.792,I'm going pro.
00:54:04.834,00:54:06.125,Oh-ho!
00:54:06.166,00:54:07.709,Okay.
00:54:07.750,00:54:10.166,"Yeah. I don't know, you know."
00:54:10.208,00:54:13.750,Uh...you'll probably be about as good as I was.
00:54:13.792,00:54:15.583,"That's kind of the way it works, you know."
00:54:15.625,00:54:16.709,And I-- I was below average.
00:54:16.750,00:54:18.709,"You know, so-- Whoa."
00:54:18.750,00:54:20.709,So you'll probably ultimately rank...
00:54:20.750,00:54:22.792,"somewhere around there, you know, so..."
00:54:22.834,00:54:26.417,"I really-- You'll excel at a lot of things, just not this."
00:54:26.458,00:54:29.792,"So I don't want you out here shooting this ball around all day and night, all right?"
00:54:29.834,00:54:31.208,All right.
00:54:31.250,00:54:32.917,Okay.
00:54:34.125,00:54:35.291,"All right, go ahead."
00:54:59.792,00:55:01.542,Hey.
00:55:04.625,00:55:06.750,Don't ever let somebody tell you...
00:55:06.792,00:55:08.917,you can't do something.
00:55:10.333,00:55:12.583,Not even me.
00:55:13.875,00:55:15.250,All right?
00:55:15.291,00:55:17.125,All right.
00:55:17.166,00:55:19.834,You got a dream...
00:55:19.875,00:55:23.417,you gotta protect it.
00:55:23.458,00:55:27.875,"People can't do something themselves, they wanna tell you you can't do it."
00:55:31.834,00:55:34.542,"If you want something, go get it."
00:55:34.583,00:55:35.917,Period.
00:55:43.834,00:55:45.583,Let's go.
00:55:47.667,00:55:51.208,Dad. Why did we move to a motel?
00:55:51.250,00:55:54.750,I told you. Because I'm-- I'm getting a better job.
00:55:54.792,00:55:56.834,"You gotta trust me, all right?"
00:55:56.875,00:55:58.333,I trust you.
00:55:58.375,00:56:00.291,"All right, here. Come on, come on. Come on. Keep up."
00:56:02.166,00:56:05.709,"Dad, when's Mom coming back?"
00:56:05.750,00:56:07.709,Dad. When's Mom coming back?
00:56:07.750,00:56:10.667,"I don't know, Christopher."
00:56:10.709,00:56:12.792,"Dad, listen to this."
00:56:12.834,00:56:16.542,"One day, a man was drowning in the water."
00:56:16.583,00:56:19.125,"And a boat came by and said, Do you need any help?"
00:56:19.166,00:56:21.750,"He said, No, thank you."
00:56:21.792,00:56:24.792,Then another boat came by.
00:56:24.834,00:56:27.750,"And he said, No, thank you."
00:56:27.792,00:56:29.792,"Then he drowned, and he went to heaven."
00:56:29.834,00:56:33.417,"And he said, God, why didn't you save me?"
00:56:33.458,00:56:36.542,"And God said, I sent you two big boats, you dummy."
00:56:38.208,00:56:39.709,Do you like it?
00:56:39.750,00:56:42.834,"Yeah, that's very funny, man."
00:56:48.667,00:56:50.500,"Oh. Thank you very much, sir."
00:56:50.542,00:56:52.208,You got the bill of sale here.
00:56:52.250,00:56:53.750,All the information you'll need.
00:56:53.792,00:56:55.792,"Uh, thank you very much for your business."
00:56:55.834,00:56:57.250,Thank you.
00:56:57.291,00:56:59.667,"Dr. Forrest, dial 182, please."
00:56:59.709,00:57:04.792,"MAN: One hundred, 200, 20, 40, 45, 46, 7, 8, 9, 10."
00:57:04.834,00:57:06.542,Thank you.
00:57:08.583,00:57:09.834,"Hey, you want one of those?"
00:57:09.875,00:57:11.750,"No, it's okay."
00:57:11.792,00:57:14.834,"Come on, you can have one. Which one?"
00:57:14.875,00:57:16.750,You like that one? How much?
00:57:16.792,00:57:18.625,Twenty-five cents.
00:57:32.583,00:57:37.458,CHRIS: This part of my life is called Internship.
00:57:37.500,00:57:39.709,MAN: The 1200 building is Medley Industrial and Sanko Oil.
00:57:39.750,00:57:42.542,The building across the street is Lee-Ray Shipping.
00:57:42.583,00:57:49.709,"In a couple of weeks, you'll get call sheets with the phone numbers of employees from every Fortune 500 company in the financial district."
00:57:49.750,00:57:52.792,You will be pooling from 60 Fortune companies.
00:57:52.834,00:57:55.792,You will mainly be cold-calling potential clients.
00:57:55.834,00:58:03.709,"But if you have to have lunch with them, have breakfast with them, even babysit for them, you will do whatever it takes to familiarize them with our packages."
00:58:03.750,00:58:07.291,We need you to match their needs and goals to one of our many financial plans.
00:58:07.333,00:58:08.792,In essence...
00:58:08.834,00:58:12.125,"you reel them in, we'll cook the fish."
00:58:13.792,00:58:16.041,Some of you guys are here because you know somebody.
00:58:16.083,00:58:18.750,Some of you are here because you think you're somebody.
00:58:18.792,00:58:21.500,But there's one guy in here who's gonna be somebody.
00:58:21.542,00:58:23.875,That person's gonna be the guy...
00:58:23.917,00:58:26.375,who can turn this into this.
00:58:26.417,00:58:29.667,Eight hundred thousand in commission dollars.
00:58:29.709,00:58:32.709,"You, you, help me hand these out."
00:58:32.750,00:58:35.792,This is going to be your bible.
00:58:35.834,00:58:37.750,You'll eat with it.
00:58:37.792,00:58:39.458,CHRIS: It was simple.
00:58:39.500,00:58:42.417,X number of calls equals X number of prospects.
00:58:42.458,00:58:45.667,X number of prospects equals X number of customers.
00:58:45.709,00:58:49.834,X number of customers equals X number of dollars in the company's pocket.
00:58:49.875,00:58:51.375,Your board exam.
00:58:51.417,00:58:57.500,"Last year, we had an intern score a 96.4 percent on the written exam."
00:58:57.542,00:58:58.709,He wasn't chosen.
00:58:58.750,00:59:00.709,It's not a simple pass/fail.
00:59:00.750,00:59:04.792,It's an evaluation tool we use to separate applicants.
00:59:04.834,00:59:06.875,Be safe. Score a hundred.
00:59:08.750,00:59:11.500,Okay. Let's take a break.
00:59:20.583,00:59:22.417,Oh. Hey. Mr. Frohm.
00:59:22.458,00:59:23.667,"Uh, Chris."
00:59:23.709,00:59:24.834,"Ah, Chris, how are you?"
00:59:24.875,00:59:25.834,I'm good. How you doing?
00:59:25.875,00:59:27.834,"Fine, thank you for asking."
00:59:27.875,00:59:30.166,"Yeah, uh, first day in there."
00:59:30.208,00:59:32.625,"You're not quitting on us yet, are you?"
00:59:32.667,00:59:34.792,"No, sir. Ten-minute break."
00:59:34.834,00:59:37.750,"Pop out, get a quick bite, and then back in there for board prep."
00:59:37.792,00:59:39.542,"Oh, man, I remember mine."
00:59:39.583,00:59:42.250,"And ours were only an hour, not three like yours."
00:59:42.291,00:59:46.500,"We didn't do world markets, we didn't bother with taxes, and it was still a pain in the ass."
00:59:46.542,00:59:48.333,Funny what you remember.
00:59:48.375,00:59:51.083,There was a beautiful girl in that class.
00:59:51.125,00:59:55.792,"I can't remember her name, but her face was so-- I've seen an old friend of mine. Uh, do-- Do you mind?"
00:59:55.834,00:59:57.166,"No, go ahead."
00:59:57.208,00:59:58.667,"Uh, good talking to you, sir."
01:00:25.250,01:00:26.917,Aah.
01:00:28.333,01:00:29.792,"Hey, hey-- Hey, asshole."
01:00:29.834,01:00:31.417,"Are you all right, asshole?"
01:00:32.875,01:00:33.875,Are-- Are you okay?
01:00:33.917,01:00:35.583,"I mean, what were you thinking?"
01:00:35.625,01:00:37.750,What are you doing?
01:00:37.792,01:00:40.458,I'm trying to cross the street.
01:00:40.500,01:00:41.792,Uh...you're all right?
01:00:41.834,01:00:42.834,"Yeah, yeah."
01:00:44.208,01:00:45.834,Where's my shoe?
01:00:45.875,01:00:47.375,You knocked off my shoe!
01:00:47.417,01:00:49.834,I don't know where your shoe is.
01:00:51.166,01:00:52.166,Where's my damn shoe?
01:00:52.208,01:00:53.291,I don't know.
01:00:59.875,01:01:00.917,Hey.
01:01:02.417,01:01:04.333,Did you see it?
01:01:04.375,01:01:05.792,"No, I'm sorry."
01:01:05.834,01:01:09.250,Hey. Hey. Where are you going?
01:01:09.291,01:01:10.625,We should wait for the police.
01:01:10.667,01:01:11.792,I gotta go to work.
01:01:12.834,01:01:14.834,"Hey, you just got hit by a car."
01:01:14.875,01:01:16.709,Go to the hospital.
01:01:16.750,01:01:20.583,I'm in a competitive internship at Dean Witter.
01:01:31.041,01:01:33.041,"Hey, man, you're missing a shoe."
01:01:33.083,01:01:35.208,Oh. Yeah.
01:01:35.250,01:01:37.208,Thank you.
01:01:42.709,01:01:44.667,CHRISTOPHER: Dad.
01:01:44.709,01:01:45.792,Y-you don't have a shoe.
01:01:45.834,01:01:47.750,Yep. I know.
01:01:47.792,01:01:49.583,Wanna know what happened?
01:01:49.625,01:01:50.667,Yeah.
01:01:51.750,01:01:53.375,I got hit by a car.
01:01:53.417,01:01:55.208,You got hit by a car?
01:01:55.250,01:01:56.750,Yep.
01:01:56.792,01:01:57.792,Where?
01:01:57.834,01:02:00.125,"Uh, just right by the office."
01:02:00.166,01:02:01.750,"No, where in your body?"
01:02:01.792,01:02:03.250,"Like, the back of my legs."
01:02:03.291,01:02:04.542,"Hey, goodbye, Mrs. Chu."
01:02:04.583,01:02:05.667,Goodbye.
01:02:05.709,01:02:06.917,Where you on the street?
01:02:06.959,01:02:08.709,Y-yeah. I was running in the street.
01:02:08.750,01:02:10.709,Don't do that.
01:02:10.750,01:02:14.291,"Yeah, thanks."
01:02:14.333,01:02:16.166,I'll remember that next time.
01:02:18.166,01:02:20.709,CHRIS: And here I was again.
01:02:20.750,01:02:22.750,FRAKESH: While qualified persons...
01:02:22.792,01:02:26.750,Qualified persons are interested in investing and have money to invest.
01:02:26.792,01:02:28.750,Now...Chris.
01:02:28.792,01:02:31.083,"Would you get me some coffee, please?"
01:02:31.125,01:02:35.333,"CHRIS: Favors for Frakesh, our office manager. All day."
01:02:35.375,01:02:37.709,My name is Chris Gardner calling for Mr. Michael Anderson.
01:02:37.750,01:02:40.667,"Well, yes, sir. We're having a lunch actually this Thursday."
01:02:40.709,01:02:43.625,"Okay, next time. All right."
01:02:43.667,01:02:44.792,"Okay, yes. Thank you."
01:02:45.917,01:02:46.917,Who wants to get me a doughnut?
01:02:46.959,01:02:49.750,Chris?
01:02:49.792,01:02:50.667,"Yes, sir."
01:02:51.834,01:02:55.417,CHRIS: Feeling underrated and unappreciated.
01:02:55.458,01:02:57.125,Hello. Mr. Ronald Fryer.
01:02:57.166,01:02:59.709,"Why, good morning to you, sir."
01:02:57.166,01:03:01.250,"My name is Chris Gardner, and I'm calling from Dean Witter."
01:03:01.291,01:03:06.291,"Yes, I have some very, very valuable information on what's called a tax-- Okay-- Thank you, sir."
01:03:07.625,01:03:12.750,CHRIS: Then catch the bus by 4 to the place where they can't spell happiness.
01:03:12.792,01:03:14.750,Then the cross-town.
01:03:14.792,01:03:17.333,The 22 home.
01:03:18.291,01:03:19.792,Hey! Chris!
01:03:19.834,01:03:20.792,"Hey. Hi, Ralph."
01:03:20.834,01:03:22.208,I'm waiting.
01:03:22.250,01:03:24.166,"All right, uh, I-I got that for you, Ralph."
01:03:24.208,01:03:26.208,I'm-- I'm gonna get that for you.
01:03:34.542,01:03:38.458,Whoever brought in the most money after six months was usually hired.
01:03:38.500,01:03:40.625,"Yes, hello, Chris Gardner calling for Mr. Walter Hobb."
01:03:40.667,01:03:43.750,We were all working our way up call sheets to sign clients.
01:03:43.792,01:03:44.750,From the bottom to the top.
01:03:44.792,01:03:46.333,"Yes, sir."
01:03:46.375,01:03:48.208,From the doorman to the CEO.
01:03:48.250,01:03:49.667,Okay.
01:03:49.709,01:03:52.458,"They'd stay till 7, but I had Christopher."
01:03:52.500,01:03:55.792,I had to do in six hours what they do in nine.
01:03:55.834,01:03:57.709,Good afternoon.
01:03:57.750,01:03:58.834,I'm calling from Dean Witter.
01:03:58.875,01:04:03.375,"In order not to waste any time, I wasn't hanging up the phone in between calls."
01:04:03.417,01:04:04.917,Okay. Thank you very much.
01:04:07.000,01:04:11.500,"I realized that by not hanging up the phone, I gained another eight minutes a day."
01:04:11.542,01:04:13.709,"Why, good morning to you, my name is Chris Gardner."
01:04:13.750,01:04:14.792,I'm calling from Dean Witter.
01:04:14.834,01:04:18.792,"I also wasn't drinking water, so I didn't waste any time in the bathroom."
01:04:18.834,01:04:24.667,"Uh, yes, I'd love to have the opportunity-- Okay-- No problem at all, sir."
01:04:24.709,01:04:25.792,But even doing all this...
01:04:25.834,01:04:27.625,after two months...
01:04:27.667,01:04:30.500,I still didn't have time to work my way up a sheet.
01:04:42.709,01:04:45.417,MAN: We're feeling really confident about that one as well.
01:04:45.458,01:04:47.583,Walter Ribbon's office.
01:04:47.625,01:04:49.083,"Yes. Hello, my name is Chris Gardner."
01:04:49.125,01:04:50.792,I'm calling for Mr. Walter Ribbon.
01:04:50.834,01:04:52.250,Concerning...?
01:04:52.291,01:04:53.792,"Yes, ma'am, I'm calling from Dean Witter."
01:04:53.834,01:04:54.917,Just a moment.
01:04:56.792,01:04:58.625,Hello?
01:04:58.667,01:05:00.542,Mr. Ribbon.
01:05:00.583,01:05:02.667,My name's Chris Gardner.
01:05:02.709,01:05:04.375,"Yeah, Chris."
01:05:02.709,01:05:07.750,"Uh, yes, Mr. Ribbon, I would love to have the opportunity to sit with you to discuss some of our products."
01:05:07.792,01:05:10.834,"And, I-- I'm certain that I could be of some assistance to you."
01:05:10.875,01:05:12.709,Can you be here in 20 minutes?
01:05:12.750,01:05:15.834,Uh...ye-- 20 minutes.
01:05:15.875,01:05:17.500,Just had someone cancel.
01:05:17.542,01:05:19.542,Come now. I can give you a few minutes before the 49ers.
01:05:19.583,01:05:21.083,"Monday Night Football, buddy."
01:05:21.125,01:05:22.667,"Yes, sir."
01:05:22.709,01:05:23.709,See you soon.
01:05:23.750,01:05:24.917,Bye-bye.
01:05:27.166,01:05:28.333,Excuse me.
01:05:28.375,01:05:29.709,Thank you for the...
01:05:29.750,01:05:31.709,"Chris, what's up?"
01:05:31.750,01:05:33.291,"Hey, man, do you have five minutes?"
01:05:33.333,01:05:40.375,"Actually, I got a green light from Walter Ribbon-- Because I have no minutes. I'm supposed to present commodities to Bromer. Could you move my car? That'd really help me out."
01:05:40.417,01:05:42.333,"It's on Samson, half block, silver Caprice."
01:05:42.375,01:05:44.709,Just move it to the other side.
01:05:44.750,01:05:46.166,There's spaces.
01:05:46.208,01:05:47.709,I have backups in my desk.
01:05:47.750,01:05:49.125,And you have to jimmy that.
01:05:49.166,01:05:50.333,"Uh, uh-- Jimmy what?!"
01:05:50.375,01:05:51.750,You have to jimmy the key.
01:05:51.792,01:05:54.125,And the other doors don't unlock.
01:05:54.166,01:05:55.166,You have to jimmy it.
01:06:12.834,01:06:14.291,Come on. I'm jimmying it.
01:06:17.875,01:06:18.917,"Oh, no!"
01:06:20.333,01:06:21.750,"Come on, come on."
01:06:34.834,01:06:36.166,"Here's the file, Mr. Ribbon."
01:06:36.208,01:06:37.250,Thank you.
01:06:41.875,01:06:42.959,"Okay, thanks a lot."
01:06:43.000,01:06:44.291,"Oh, yeah, thanks."
01:06:48.875,01:06:50.917,"No. No, no, no, no!"
01:07:01.834,01:07:05.041,"Rachel, get Ristuccia on the phone for me, please."
01:07:53.125,01:07:54.792,Hi.
01:07:54.834,01:07:56.709,I'm Chris Gardner. I have an appointment with Mr. Ribbon.
01:07:56.750,01:07:58.917,"Oh, you just missed him."
01:08:01.667,01:08:03.208,"Ah, thank you."
01:08:27.208,01:08:28.709,CHRISTOPHER: What's that?
01:08:28.750,01:08:31.083,Just filling out a check.
01:08:31.125,01:08:33.792,Paying some bills and a...
01:08:33.834,01:08:35.542,parking ticket.
01:08:37.750,01:08:40.166,We don't have a car anymore.
01:08:40.208,01:08:42.750,Yep. I know.
01:08:43.834,01:08:45.750,"Oh, um..."
01:08:45.792,01:08:49.166,I'm gonna need to take you with me this weekend.
01:08:49.208,01:08:51.834,A couple doctors' offices.
01:08:51.875,01:08:53.750,"On sales calls, okay?"
01:08:53.792,01:08:55.917,Okay.
01:08:58.792,01:09:00.583,"Then, possibly..."
01:09:00.625,01:09:02.834,we'll go to the football game.
01:09:02.875,01:09:03.834,Really?
01:09:03.875,01:09:04.959,"Uh, possibly."
01:09:05.875,01:09:06.709,All right?
01:09:06.750,01:09:08.834,All right.
01:09:08.875,01:09:10.375,"Come on, finish up."
01:09:11.333,01:09:12.208,Are you sure?
01:09:12.250,01:09:14.709,I was-- Possibly.
01:09:15.625,01:09:16.792,Really?
01:09:46.750,01:09:49.417,Are you bringing it to the game?
01:09:49.458,01:09:51.709,Yeah. I don't-- I don't wanna leave it.
01:09:51.750,01:09:54.250,And maybe we're going to the game.
01:09:55.291,01:09:56.250,All right.
01:09:56.291,01:09:57.750,Where are we going now?
01:09:57.792,01:10:00.500,"Uh, to see someone about my job."
01:10:00.542,01:10:02.291,I don't understand.
01:10:02.333,01:10:03.750,You don't understand what?
01:10:03.792,01:10:05.792,Are we going to the game?
01:10:05.834,01:10:08.542,I said possibly we're going to the game.
01:10:08.583,01:10:10.792,You know what possibly means?
01:10:10.834,01:10:13.750,"No, probably means there's a good chance that we're going."
01:10:13.792,01:10:16.792,"Possibly means we might, we might not."
01:10:16.834,01:10:18.250,What does probably mean?
01:10:18.291,01:10:20.250,It means we have a good chance.
01:10:20.291,01:10:21.667,And what does possibly mean?
01:10:21.709,01:10:23.917,I know what it means.
01:10:23.959,01:10:27.250,It means that we're not going to the game.
01:10:28.834,01:10:30.333,How did you get so smart?
01:10:30.375,01:10:31.834,Cause you're smart.
01:10:36.875,01:10:38.250,Are we there?
01:10:38.291,01:10:39.917,Yeah.
01:10:44.875,01:10:46.208,Mr. Ribbon.
01:10:46.250,01:10:48.834,Yes?
01:10:48.875,01:10:50.166,Dean Witter.
01:10:50.208,01:10:51.709,"Oh, hi. Hi."
01:10:51.750,01:10:53.083,"This is my son, Christopher."
01:10:53.125,01:10:54.458,Hi.
01:10:54.500,01:10:55.792,W-w-what are you doing up here?
01:10:55.834,01:10:58.834,"Uh, I came to apologize for missing our appointment the other day."
01:10:58.875,01:11:00.792,"Oh, you didn't need to come up."
01:10:58.875,01:11:07.542,"Oh, no. Actually, we were in the neighborhood visiting a very close friend of ours, and I-I just wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you for your time."
01:11:07.583,01:11:08.792,I know you probably waited for me.
01:11:08.834,01:11:09.834,Little bit.
01:11:09.875,01:11:12.792,I-I want you to know that I do not take that for granted.
01:11:12.834,01:11:14.709,"Oh, come on. W-what, uh-- What's that?"
01:11:14.750,01:11:18.667,"Oh, this-- Uh, an Osteo National bone-density scanner."
01:11:18.709,01:11:20.333,Oh.
01:11:20.375,01:11:22.375,A company I bought into prior to going to work at Witter.
01:11:22.417,01:11:23.750,I have a meeting after the game.
01:11:23.792,01:11:25.792,You guys are going to the game?
01:11:25.834,01:11:27.083,Possibly.
01:11:27.125,01:11:28.792,Possibly.
01:11:28.834,01:11:30.792,We're-- We're going too.
01:11:30.834,01:11:32.709,My 12-year-old.
01:11:32.750,01:11:34.709,"Listen, we'll-- We'll get out of your way."
01:11:34.750,01:11:37.792,"Um, again, thank you very much, and I'm sorry about the other day."
01:11:37.834,01:11:39.750,And I hope that we can reschedule for later this week.
01:11:39.792,01:11:41.458,You got it.
01:11:41.500,01:11:43.750,All right.
01:11:43.792,01:11:45.417,"Um. Say bye-bye, Chris."
01:11:45.458,01:11:47.166,"Bye, Christopher."
01:11:47.208,01:11:48.750,"Hey, you guys wanna come with us?"
01:11:48.792,01:11:50.542,"What, uh--?"
01:11:50.583,01:11:51.709,We're going now.
01:11:51.750,01:11:53.166,Where are your seats?
01:11:53.208,01:11:55.375,"Oh, we've-- We're...upper deck."
01:11:55.417,01:11:56.750,We got a box.
01:11:56.792,01:11:57.834,You wanna sit in a box?
01:11:57.875,01:11:59.083,No.
01:11:59.125,01:12:01.792,Well-- It's not actually a box.
01:12:01.834,01:12:04.250,"It's-- It's, um..."
01:12:04.291,01:12:06.792,It's more comfortable.
01:12:07.709,01:12:08.792,Okay.
01:12:08.834,01:12:11.792,RIBBON: Okay. Kids in the back.
01:12:11.834,01:12:14.333,"Hey, why don't you just put that in your car?"
01:12:14.375,01:12:15.917,Um...
01:12:16.875,01:12:18.667,"Yeah, okay-- Uh, sure. Sure."
01:12:18.709,01:12:19.792,We don't have a car.
01:12:19.834,01:12:20.792,Ah!
01:12:20.834,01:12:22.834,"Oh, my G-- What happened?"
01:12:22.875,01:12:24.583,I think I got stung by a bee.
01:12:24.625,01:12:26.792,You all right?
01:12:26.834,01:12:28.792,Goodness. I'm fine.
01:12:28.834,01:12:30.166,"No, no, no. Aah."
01:12:30.208,01:12:31.834,Where'd he get you?
01:12:31.875,01:12:34.083,"Just, like, right at the, uh, back of my head. Aah."
01:12:34.125,01:12:36.750,Are you okay?
01:12:36.792,01:12:38.792,Does it hurt?
01:12:38.834,01:12:39.917,Let me see.
01:12:39.959,01:12:42.583,Christopher. Sit back.
01:12:42.625,01:12:48.667,CHRIS: Thomas Jefferson mentions happiness a couple times in the Declaration of Independence.
01:12:48.709,01:12:52.417,"May seem like a strange word to be in that document, but..."
01:12:52.458,01:12:54.542,he was sort of...
01:12:54.583,01:12:56.625,He was an artist.
01:12:56.667,01:13:01.709,"He called the English, the disturbers of our harmony."
01:13:01.750,01:13:06.250,And I remember standing there that day thinking about the disturbers of mine.
01:13:06.291,01:13:07.333,Questions I had.
01:13:07.375,01:13:09.667,Whether...all this was good.
01:13:10.792,01:13:12.834,Whether I'd make it.
01:13:14.750,01:13:20.542,"And Walter Ribbon, and his Pacific Bell pension money, which was millions."
01:13:20.583,01:13:21.709,Yeah!
01:13:22.834,01:13:26.166,It was a way to another place.
01:13:26.208,01:13:27.625,"Wow. This is, aah..."
01:13:29.041,01:13:30.625,This is the way to watch a football game here.
01:13:30.667,01:13:32.542,"Thank you very much for this, really."
01:13:32.583,01:13:33.917,"Hey, that's my pleasure, Chris."
01:13:33.959,01:13:45.709,"And, uh, Mr. Ribbon, I also wanna thank you for giving me the opportunity to discuss the asset management capabilities of Dean Witter, which we believe to be far superior to anything you got going over at Morgan Stanley."
01:13:45.750,01:13:47.750,"And, uh, really, I think you're gonna be blown away."
01:13:47.792,01:13:53.125,"Point blank, Dean Witter needs to be managing your retirement portfolio."
01:13:53.166,01:13:56.166,"You know, I didn't have any notion that you were new over there."
01:13:56.208,01:13:58.333,"I mean, I like you, but..."
01:13:56.208,01:13:59.792,there's not a chance I'm gonna let you direct our fund.
01:13:59.834,01:14:01.792,"That's just not gonna happen anytime soon, buddy."
01:14:01.834,01:14:03.458,"So...you know, come on, relax."
01:14:03.500,01:14:05.417,Let's play the game.
01:14:06.583,01:14:07.667,Yeah!
01:14:09.750,01:14:12.709,Yes! Yes! Yeah!
01:14:16.834,01:14:18.125,Here you go.
01:14:18.166,01:14:19.750,I've had a few ideas already. Absolutely.
01:14:19.792,01:14:21.750,Chris. I'll talk to you later.
01:14:21.792,01:14:22.834,I'm gonna give you a call.
01:14:22.875,01:14:24.375,"Nice to meet you, Chris."
01:14:24.417,01:14:26.917,Give me a call.
01:14:32.834,01:14:34.333,Bye.
01:14:34.375,01:14:36.417,"SON: Bye, Christopher."
01:15:05.834,01:15:09.917,"CHRIS: After four months, we had sold all our scanners."
01:15:11.500,01:15:12.917,It seemed we were making it.
01:15:13.875,01:15:15.291,What's the...
01:15:15.333,01:15:16.834,fastest animal in the world?
01:15:16.875,01:15:18.083,Jackrabbit.
01:15:19.792,01:15:21.625,Seemed we were...
01:15:21.667,01:15:23.792,doing good.
01:15:23.834,01:15:25.750,Till one day...
01:15:25.792,01:15:27.709,that day...
01:15:27.750,01:15:29.959,that letter brought me back to earth.
01:15:37.166,01:15:39.917,This part of my life is called Paying Taxes.
01:15:41.834,01:15:48.542,"If you didn't pay 'em, the government could stick their hands into your bank account and take your money."
01:15:48.583,01:15:49.500,Dad.
01:15:49.542,01:15:51.667,No warning. Nothing.
01:15:51.709,01:15:55.250,It can't be too late.
01:15:55.291,01:15:58.709,How is somebody just gonna-- Just take my money?
01:15:58.750,01:16:03.583,I w-- I was-- Listen...I-- That's all the money that I have.
01:16:03.625,01:16:10.750,You cannot go into my bank acc-- No-- It was the 25th of September.
01:16:10.792,01:16:12.667,I remember that day.
01:16:12.709,01:16:14.709,Because that's the day that I found out...
01:16:14.750,01:16:20.291,there was only 21 dollars and 33 cents left in my bank account.
01:16:20.333,01:16:22.750,I was broke.
01:16:32.208,01:16:34.667,You dressed yet?
01:16:38.750,01:16:40.166,Chris! Chris!
01:16:40.208,01:16:41.709,"Don't jerk me around, okay, Chris?"
01:16:41.750,01:16:43.709,"I'm not jerking you around, Ralph, all right?"
01:16:43.750,01:16:44.875,I g-- I'm gonna get it.
01:16:44.917,01:16:47.125,I need that money now.
01:16:47.166,01:16:48.834,"When I get it, you get it, Ralph."
01:16:48.875,01:16:50.917,Now!
01:16:54.375,01:16:56.750,"Hey. What's happening, man?"
01:16:56.792,01:17:00.792,"Wayne, uh-- I need to-- To get that $14 from you."
01:17:00.834,01:17:02.750,I-- I thought I didn't owe you that now.
01:17:02.792,01:17:06.709,What? Why?
01:17:06.750,01:17:09.250,Why would you think you don't owe me my money?
01:17:09.291,01:17:11.875,I helped you move.
01:17:13.417,01:17:16.500,"You drove me two blocks, Wayne."
01:17:16.542,01:17:18.417,That's 200 yards.
01:17:18.458,01:17:20.667,"It's been four months, Wayne."
01:17:20.709,01:17:22.333,I need my money.
01:17:22.375,01:17:23.875,I need my money right now.
01:17:23.917,01:17:25.208,"I don't have it, man."
01:17:25.250,01:17:26.875,"Wayne, go get my money."
01:17:26.917,01:17:29.375,"Wayne. Get my mo-- I really don't, man. It's $14."
01:17:29.417,01:17:31.333,It's my $14!
01:17:31.375,01:17:33.917,All of this for $14.
01:17:51.875,01:17:53.625,"Dad, look at me!"
01:17:54.709,01:17:57.417,Dad!
01:17:57.458,01:17:59.125,Should I go?
01:17:59.166,01:18:01.417,"Sure, man. Why not?"
01:18:16.417,01:18:18.125,"Stay here, Christopher."
01:18:18.166,01:18:19.709,"No, no. Stay right here."
01:18:19.750,01:18:21.917,Did you hear what I said?
01:18:27.750,01:18:29.375,"Dad, where you going?"
01:18:29.417,01:18:30.959,Hey-- What did I say?
01:18:34.583,01:18:36.417,Dad!
01:18:36.458,01:18:39.917,"Dad, wait!"
01:18:47.875,01:18:48.792,Dad!
01:18:48.834,01:18:52.500,"I gotta-- I gotta get back to the '60s, man."
01:18:52.542,01:18:55.667,That's what I wanna do.
01:18:52.542,01:18:58.417,"When I was younger, I-- I wanna see Jimi Hendrix do that guitar on fire."
01:19:01.291,01:19:04.333,Bring back my time machine!
01:19:05.583,01:19:07.208,Bring my time machine back!
01:19:15.834,01:19:17.792,"Dad, where are we going?"
01:19:17.834,01:19:19.792,Just be quiet.
01:19:19.834,01:19:22.417,Go get your things. Go.
01:19:45.750,01:19:47.709,Chris?
01:19:47.750,01:19:49.792,Dr. Telm can't get back to meet you.
01:19:49.834,01:19:51.917,I'm sorry.
01:20:02.834,01:20:05.750,Where are we going now?
01:20:05.792,01:20:09.750,"Gotta, uh-- We gotta see somebody else."
01:20:11.500,01:20:13.542,I'm tired.
01:20:15.667,01:20:17.792,I know.
01:20:22.458,01:20:24.583,Um...
01:20:24.625,01:20:26.792,"Doesn't seem to be, uh, functioning..."
01:20:26.834,01:20:28.834,right now.
01:20:28.875,01:20:30.291,"I have to go now, Chris."
01:20:30.333,01:20:32.709,"No. No, no. Uh..."
01:20:32.750,01:20:34.834,I'm sure I can-- I'm gonna be able to figure it out.
01:20:37.333,01:20:39.709,Chris. Chris. Just come back when it's working.
01:20:39.750,01:20:41.542,No. No. I-- I-- I have to fix it now.
01:20:41.583,01:20:43.208,No.
01:20:43.250,01:20:45.792,"Look, I'll still be putting money into the office, then..."
01:20:45.834,01:20:48.250,all right?
01:20:48.291,01:20:49.750,"I really have to go, Chris."
01:20:51.709,01:20:53.583,Thank you. Thank you.
01:20:53.625,01:20:55.417,Thank you for your time.
01:20:55.458,01:20:57.417,I'll see you soon.
01:21:49.333,01:21:50.917,Why are our things here?
01:21:52.834,01:21:54.500,Dad.
01:22:36.792,01:22:38.917,Let's go. Come on.
01:22:40.792,01:22:42.250,Come on.
01:22:42.291,01:22:43.917,Why?
01:22:43.959,01:22:46.083,We can't stay here tonight.
01:22:46.125,01:22:47.500,Hey. Did you hear what I said?
01:22:47.542,01:22:48.834,Let's go.
01:22:51.667,01:22:55.792,Hey. Did you hear what I said? Stop it.
01:22:55.834,01:22:57.500,Stop it.
01:23:00.834,01:23:02.750,Come on.
01:23:11.875,01:23:13.750,Come on.
01:23:30.583,01:23:32.834,Wayne!
01:23:32.875,01:23:35.291,Wayne!
01:23:42.291,01:23:44.750,Wayne!
01:23:59.917,01:24:03.917,Get up. Stand up.
01:24:19.750,01:24:21.250,Where are we going?
01:24:23.792,01:24:25.750,Dad! Where are we going?
01:24:25.792,01:24:27.458,I don't know.
01:24:41.834,01:24:44.834,It's not a time machine.
01:24:44.875,01:24:46.792,Dad.
01:24:46.834,01:24:48.709,It's not a time machine.
01:24:48.750,01:24:50.083,The guy said it was a time machine.
01:24:50.125,01:24:52.125,It's not a time machine.
01:24:52.166,01:24:53.375,What guy?
01:24:53.417,01:24:54.792,The guy.
01:24:54.834,01:24:56.667,He said it was a time machine.
01:25:03.250,01:25:04.834,"Yes, it is."
01:25:05.834,01:25:07.917,"No, it's not."
01:25:09.834,01:25:11.917,It is.
01:25:17.750,01:25:21.750,All we gotta do is push this black button right here.
01:25:25.834,01:25:26.917,You wanna push it?
01:25:31.500,01:25:32.917,Okay.
01:25:34.750,01:25:36.333,Come on.
01:25:37.834,01:25:39.917,"Come on, man."
01:25:44.834,01:25:46.166,Right here.
01:25:46.208,01:25:48.208,Wait a minute.
01:25:48.250,01:25:50.625,I don't know.
01:25:50.667,01:25:52.417,You gotta close your eyes.
01:25:52.458,01:25:54.625,You close your eyes.
01:25:56.542,01:25:58.917,"All right, come on."
01:26:05.125,01:26:06.709,You gotta close your eyes.
01:26:06.750,01:26:09.959,It takes a few seconds.
01:26:11.875,01:26:13.750,"Oh, my goodness."
01:26:13.792,01:26:15.917,"W-- Open, open, open!"
01:26:16.750,01:26:19.125,Whoa.
01:26:19.166,01:26:20.792,What is it?
01:26:20.834,01:26:21.834,Dinosaurs.
01:26:21.875,01:26:23.250,Where?
01:26:23.291,01:26:25.834,You don't see all these dinosaurs?
01:26:25.875,01:26:27.291,Look around.
01:26:27.333,01:26:29.375,Look at all these dinosaurs.
01:26:29.417,01:26:31.375,Wow.
01:26:31.417,01:26:32.500,Do you see 'em?
01:26:32.542,01:26:33.750,Yeah.
01:26:33.792,01:26:35.333,"Wait. Come on, come on, come on."
01:26:35.375,01:26:36.709,Wait-- Watch out.
01:26:36.750,01:26:37.834,What is it?
01:26:37.875,01:26:39.583,We're cavemen.
01:26:39.625,01:26:43.625,"We need this fire, 'cause there's no electricity, and it's cold out here, okay?"
01:26:43.667,01:26:46.333,Watch out! Watch out!
01:26:46.375,01:26:48.125,That's-- Get your stuff.
01:26:48.166,01:26:51.208,Get-- Get it-- Get up here.
01:26:51.250,01:26:52.750,We gotta find someplace safe.
01:26:52.792,01:26:53.834,Like what?
01:26:53.875,01:26:56.834,Um...we need a cave.
01:26:56.875,01:26:57.875,A cave?
01:26:57.917,01:26:59.625,We gotta find a cave. Come on.
01:26:59.667,01:27:01.250,Okay.
01:27:02.792,01:27:05.166,Wait-- Watch your back! Look out.
01:27:05.208,01:27:07.417,Here it is. Here's a cave. Come on.
01:27:07.458,01:27:09.625,"Right here, right here."
01:27:09.667,01:27:10.583,Whoa.
01:27:10.625,01:27:11.792,Go ahead.
01:27:11.834,01:27:13.917,"Hurry, hurry. Hurry."
01:27:17.667,01:27:19.375,Are we safe?
01:27:19.417,01:27:21.625,"Yeah, I think so."
01:28:29.542,01:28:30.583,Hey.
01:28:32.458,01:28:34.208,How you doing? Jay?
01:28:34.250,01:28:35.792,"How you, uh, getting along?"
01:28:35.834,01:28:36.709,Good. I'm good.
01:28:36.750,01:28:38.333,You doing good?
01:28:38.375,01:28:40.583,How you doing?
01:28:41.875,01:28:43.792,Where you going?
01:28:43.834,01:28:45.917,Oh. Um...
01:28:46.917,01:28:48.792,"I, uh-- Sacramento."
01:28:48.834,01:28:50.125,"'Cause, um..."
01:28:50.166,01:28:57.625,"I'm trying to move a couple guys that-- From-- They're at-- At PacBell, and I'm trying to bring them over-- Get them over to us."
01:28:57.667,01:28:59.792,So they got me going out there golfing.
01:28:59.834,01:29:01.750,Awesome.
01:29:01.792,01:29:03.875,"Hey, let 'em win a round."
01:29:08.834,01:29:10.709,Deborah. Someone's asking for you.
01:29:10.750,01:29:12.709,Where?
01:29:12.750,01:29:14.333,Please come with me.
01:29:21.875,01:29:23.625,Hi.
01:29:23.667,01:29:26.625,How you doing?
01:29:26.667,01:29:28.709,Can I ask you a question?
01:29:28.750,01:29:29.875,Um...
01:29:31.208,01:29:32.750,We need a room.
01:29:32.792,01:29:33.792,Um...
01:29:33.834,01:29:35.792,Just until I can...
01:29:35.834,01:29:37.375,fix this and sell it.
01:29:37.417,01:29:39.625,There's just some glasswork.
01:29:39.667,01:29:41.792,"I wish I could help you-- This is my son, Christopher."
01:29:41.834,01:29:43.792,He's 5 years old.
01:29:43.834,01:29:44.834,"Hi, baby."
01:29:44.875,01:29:46.125,We need someplace to stay.
01:29:46.166,01:29:49.709,"Okay. And I would love to help you, but we don't take men here."
01:29:49.750,01:29:51.208,It's only women and children.
01:29:51.250,01:29:54.625,"Now, he can stay here, but you have to find someplace else to go."
01:29:54.667,01:29:56.125,We gotta stay together.
01:29:56.166,01:29:59.625,"We got-- We-- We're-- Okay. Okay, listen."
01:29:57.709,01:30:02.750,You gotta have someplace-- Try Glide Memorial.
01:30:02.792,01:30:04.625,"So you hurry up, 'cause there's a line."
01:30:04.667,01:30:05.709,Where is it?
01:30:05.750,01:30:07.709,E-E-Ellis and Jones.
01:30:42.875,01:30:45.333,"Hey! Hey, everybody."
01:30:45.375,01:30:48.667,"We have four spots left, and that's all."
01:30:48.709,01:30:50.125,Man.
01:30:50.166,01:30:52.166,"Hey. Come on, man."
01:30:52.208,01:30:53.458,Come on.
01:30:53.500,01:30:55.333,"Hey, that's my spot."
01:30:55.375,01:30:57.709,"Come on, don't do this to me."
01:31:00.250,01:31:01.792,Dad! Dad!
01:31:01.834,01:31:04.500,Stop it! Break it up!
01:31:04.542,01:31:06.417,Stop!
01:31:06.458,01:31:08.709,"Get out of the line, both of you. Both of you."
01:31:08.750,01:31:11.709,I was here first. They told me that we had to be here on time.
01:31:11.750,01:31:13.792,I got here on time.
01:31:13.834,01:31:15.750,"I came from work, I got my son."
01:31:15.792,01:31:18.667,I was here on time.
01:31:18.709,01:31:20.458,He sliced in front of him in line.
01:31:20.500,01:31:21.375,Who did?
01:31:21.417,01:31:22.792,He did.
01:31:22.834,01:31:24.583,Come on.
01:31:24.625,01:31:26.667,Come on. Let's go.
01:31:36.750,01:31:37.917,That's it.
01:31:45.834,01:31:46.792,What's your favorite color?
01:31:46.834,01:31:48.750,Green.
01:31:48.792,01:31:50.417,Green?
01:31:50.458,01:31:51.792,What do you like that's green?
01:31:51.834,01:31:53.667,Trees.
01:31:53.709,01:31:54.709,Trees.
01:31:54.750,01:31:56.792,What else?
01:31:56.834,01:31:57.792,Holly.
01:31:59.875,01:32:02.166,Holly. What's holly?
01:32:02.208,01:32:04.458,The Christmas stuff.
01:32:04.500,01:32:06.333,Ah. Christmas stuff.
01:32:07.709,01:32:09.500,What's that?
01:32:12.625,01:32:15.625,I guess they want us to go to sleep.
01:32:21.500,01:32:22.792,There you go.
01:32:22.834,01:32:24.208,We gotta...
01:32:24.250,01:32:27.542,make sure Captain America's warm in there.
01:32:27.583,01:32:29.291,Can he breathe?
01:32:29.333,01:32:31.750,He's good?
01:32:31.792,01:32:34.250,I gotta go work on the scanner-- Don't go.
01:32:34.291,01:32:37.667,"No, no, no. I'm gonna be-- I'll be right outside the door."
01:32:37.709,01:32:41.750,All right? I'm just-- I'm gonna be right there-- I'll leave the door open a little bit.
01:32:41.792,01:32:45.125,And I'll be able to hear you if you call me.
01:32:45.166,01:32:47.917,I wanna go home.
01:32:49.834,01:32:53.792,"But...that's why I gotta, uh, work on the scanner."
01:32:53.834,01:32:56.458,All right?
01:32:56.500,01:32:58.583,I'm gonna go out there. Um...
01:32:58.625,01:33:01.792,I'm gonna leave the door open.
01:33:01.834,01:33:03.083,And...
01:33:03.125,01:33:04.792,I'll be able to hear you if you call me.
01:33:04.834,01:33:06.625,All right?
01:33:06.667,01:33:07.750,All right.
01:33:07.792,01:33:10.667,"You gotta trust me, okay?"
01:33:10.709,01:33:11.792,You gotta trust me.
01:33:13.625,01:33:14.792,You gotta...
01:33:13.625,01:33:17.792,Trust you. I trust-- You gotta-- I trust you.
01:33:17.834,01:33:19.291,I trust-- I can't hear you.
01:33:19.333,01:33:22.917,I trust you.
01:33:24.792,01:33:25.917,All right.
01:33:28.875,01:33:29.792,Mwah.
01:33:39.166,01:33:40.792,"I'll just be a little while, okay?"
01:33:40.834,01:33:42.375,All right.
01:33:42.417,01:33:43.834,I'll be right here.
01:33:43.875,01:33:45.166,Okay.
01:33:45.208,01:33:46.417,Can you still hear me?
01:33:46.458,01:33:47.750,Yeah.
01:33:47.792,01:33:49.417,Can you hear me?
01:33:49.458,01:33:50.792,Do you trust me?
01:34:39.041,01:34:40.792,Yeah.
01:34:40.834,01:34:42.250,Yeah. Put that one...
01:34:42.291,01:34:43.375,Then you go like that.
01:34:44.875,01:34:46.125,Is that okay?
01:34:46.166,01:34:48.709,I don't know.
01:34:48.750,01:34:50.750,It's good.
01:34:50.792,01:34:54.250,Let's go.
01:34:54.291,01:34:55.834,"Hey, why don't you leave it?"
01:34:55.875,01:34:57.667,We can't.
01:34:57.709,01:34:59.792,We're gonna have a different room later.
01:34:59.834,01:35:02.667,Go.
01:35:06.875,01:35:08.542,"Hey, Chris."
01:35:08.583,01:35:10.208,"Hey. Good morning, Mr. Frakesh."
01:35:10.250,01:35:11.917,What's up?
01:35:12.834,01:35:14.291,Work trip.
01:35:14.333,01:35:16.709,"Your wife, Martha, works at PacBell also, correct?"
01:35:16.750,01:35:18.709,"Yes, she does."
01:35:16.750,01:35:20.542,And you guys are both looking to retire at about the same time?
01:35:20.583,01:35:24.709,We'd like to retire and maintain the same lifestyle without paying a lot of taxes.
01:35:22.709,01:35:27.291,"So basically, you don't want nobody's hands in your pockets but your own?"
01:35:27.333,01:35:28.750,Nobody's.
01:35:28.792,01:35:30.500,Are you familiar with tax-free municipal...?
01:35:30.542,01:35:32.709,CHRIS: I learned to finish my work quickly.
01:35:32.750,01:35:34.333,I had to finish quickly.
01:35:35.625,01:35:38.542,To get in line at Glide by 5.
01:35:42.667,01:35:44.834,Come on. Come on.
01:35:44.875,01:35:46.667,Come on!
01:35:50.834,01:35:51.792,Hold that bus!
01:35:51.834,01:35:53.417,Hold the-- Hold the bus!
01:35:54.291,01:35:56.375,My Captain America!
01:35:56.417,01:35:58.750,Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!
01:35:58.792,01:36:01.208,Stop it! Shut up!
01:36:03.250,01:36:04.750,Excuse me.
01:36:04.792,01:36:06.375,Why don't you let the lady in?
01:36:06.417,01:36:08.250,"Hey, man, that's not cool."
01:36:08.291,01:36:09.625,Back up!
01:36:17.875,01:36:19.166,Come on.
01:36:22.709,01:36:24.917,"Dad, we need to get it!"
01:36:27.208,01:36:32.500,PREACHER: The important thing about that freedom train is it's got to climb mountains.
01:36:32.542,01:36:35.458,We all have to deal with mountains.
01:36:35.500,01:36:38.709,You know...mountains that go way up high.
01:36:38.750,01:36:40.750,And mountains that go deep and low.
01:36:40.792,01:36:42.542,"MAN: Amen, preacher!"
01:36:42.583,01:36:44.917,We know what those mountains are here at Glide.
01:36:44.959,01:36:46.083,We sing about them.
01:36:47.625,01:37:24.000,ALL: Yes.
01:37:43.333,01:38:00.917,ALL: FEMALE SINGER: ALL: When's your test?
01:38:01.834,01:38:03.750,Tomorrow.
01:38:07.834,01:38:09.709,Are you ready?
01:38:13.625,01:38:14.917,Of course.
01:38:53.875,01:38:55.667,"Thank you, sir."
01:39:04.750,01:39:06.041,Hey.
01:39:06.083,01:39:07.583,How you doing?
01:39:10.709,01:39:12.291,"So did you finish the whole thing, or..."
01:39:12.333,01:39:13.709,you have to go somewhere?
01:39:13.750,01:39:15.667,I-- I have-- I have to go somewhere.
01:39:15.709,01:39:17.125,Right.
01:39:17.166,01:39:18.792,But I finished the whole thing too.
01:39:18.834,01:39:20.166,Oh. Good.
01:39:20.208,01:39:22.291,You?
01:39:22.333,01:39:24.375,How'd-- What-- How did you feel about the graphs?
01:39:24.417,01:39:26.583,Easy.
01:39:26.625,01:39:29.166,I struggled with the-- With the essay question on the back.
01:39:29.208,01:39:30.834,What did you write?
01:39:30.875,01:39:32.500,Essay question?
01:39:32.542,01:39:34.750,Yeah. On the back.
01:39:44.542,01:39:45.792,Hey. Chris.
01:39:45.834,01:39:48.208,"Hey. Uh-- Uh, Jeff, right?"
01:39:48.250,01:39:49.500,Yeah.
01:39:49.542,01:39:50.834,Yeah. You were gonna give me a call.
01:39:50.875,01:39:52.917,I never actually got your number.
01:39:54.750,01:39:56.792,Here's my number.
01:39:56.834,01:39:58.917,"Yes, sir. Absolutely."
01:40:00.208,01:40:02.667,Chris. You got five bucks?
01:40:02.709,01:40:04.250,I left my wallet upstairs.
01:40:04.291,01:40:06.625,"Let me, uh, run up and grab that for you, Mr. Frohm."
01:40:06.667,01:40:08.917,"No, I gotta be in CAL Bank at 4, and I'm late."
01:40:10.834,01:40:12.208,Um...
01:40:13.834,01:40:15.375,Um...
01:40:15.417,01:40:17.375,"I'll pay you back, honest."
01:40:17.417,01:40:20.208,Five is lovely.
01:40:34.500,01:40:36.834,That's it. That's the room quota.
01:40:36.875,01:40:40.250,There's no more space.
01:40:40.291,01:40:41.583,That's it for today.
01:40:41.625,01:40:43.250,Come back tomorrow.
01:40:43.291,01:40:46.542,All the rooms are closed.
01:40:46.583,01:40:48.375,That's it.
01:40:48.417,01:40:49.792,Come back tomorrow.
01:41:25.875,01:41:27.417,You like it?
01:42:18.875,01:42:22.542,"Twenty, one, two, three, four."
01:42:25.417,01:42:26.750,"Now, here's your bulb..."
01:42:26.792,01:42:29.166,and there's your ferrite core inductor.
01:42:29.208,01:42:30.625,How much?
01:42:32.291,01:42:35.208,CHRISTOPHER: What's that?
01:42:35.250,01:42:36.834,"Uh, it's to repair the light."
01:42:36.875,01:42:38.792,Can I see it?
01:42:39.834,01:42:41.000,Uh...
01:42:41.041,01:42:43.792,"Yeah, sure."
01:42:43.834,01:42:46.458,Unless you wanna...
01:42:43.834,01:42:47.917,sleep in a room with me for the rest of your life.
01:42:49.458,01:42:51.792,I don't mind.
01:42:51.834,01:42:54.458,"Yeah, you will."
01:43:09.750,01:43:12.709,"Why don't you get some sleep, okay?"
01:43:12.750,01:43:13.709,Okay.
01:43:13.750,01:43:17.333,Warm enough?
01:43:17.375,01:43:18.917,All right.
01:43:21.041,01:43:23.917,Did Mom leave because of me?
01:43:27.458,01:43:28.625,What?
01:43:28.667,01:43:31.917,Did Mom leave because of me?
01:43:36.166,01:43:37.750,Don't-- Don't even...
01:43:37.792,01:43:39.917,think something like that.
01:43:41.875,01:43:43.792,Mom left because of Mom.
01:43:43.834,01:43:46.667,"And you didn't have anything to do with that, okay?"
01:43:46.709,01:43:49.542,Okay.
01:43:58.834,01:44:01.291,You're a good papa.
01:44:08.875,01:44:09.917,"All right, go to sleep."
01:44:11.542,01:44:14.709,I love you.
01:45:10.834,01:45:12.959,"So far so good, Chris."
01:45:18.750,01:45:21.709,It works.
01:45:21.750,01:45:25.792,Two hundred and fifty dollars.
01:45:25.834,01:45:30.417,"One hundred, 20, 40, 60, 80, 200."
01:45:30.458,01:45:34.208,"Twenty, 30, 40, 50."
01:45:34.250,01:45:36.166,Anything else?
01:45:36.208,01:45:37.792,Thank you. Thank you.
01:45:37.834,01:45:38.792,You ready?
01:45:38.834,01:45:39.917,Bye.
01:45:41.583,01:45:43.750,Are we going to the church place?
01:45:43.792,01:45:47.208,No.
01:45:47.250,01:45:50.000,Probably stay at a hotel.
01:45:50.041,01:45:51.333,"Well, just for the night."
01:45:51.375,01:45:54.333,We can go back to the cave if you like.
01:45:54.375,01:45:56.208,Hm.
01:45:56.250,01:45:58.834,Ever?
01:45:58.875,01:46:00.750,Why not?
01:46:00.792,01:46:06.291,"Well, 'cause some things are fun the first time you do 'em, and then not so much the next."
01:46:06.333,01:46:09.291,Like the bus?
01:46:09.333,01:46:13.083,I'm sorry.
01:46:16.166,01:46:19.750,MAN 1: He doesn't know where it is though.
01:46:19.792,01:46:23.917,Didn't you ever want to have a home of your own like other people?
01:46:25.667,01:46:30.750,"WOMAN: Sometimes when we're moving at night, we pass houses with lights and people."
01:46:30.792,01:46:32.917,Sometimes you can hear them laugh.
01:46:38.333,01:46:41.709,The next day...after work...
01:46:41.750,01:46:44.291,we just went to the beach.
01:46:44.333,01:46:46.333,Far away from anything.
01:46:46.375,01:46:47.750,Everything.
01:46:47.792,01:46:49.917,Just Christopher and me.
01:46:51.166,01:46:53.625,Did you see me?
01:46:53.667,01:46:57.125,Far away from...
01:46:53.667,01:47:01.917,buses and noise and a constant disappointment in my 10-gallon head.
01:47:03.792,01:47:06.417,And myself.
01:47:06.458,01:47:08.291,"Chris, thank you very much."
01:47:08.333,01:47:10.834,"Take care, Chris."
01:47:10.875,01:47:12.792,"Thanks, Chris."
01:47:14.542,01:47:20.125,Because when I was young and I'd get an A on a history test or whatever...
01:47:20.166,01:47:24.583,I'd get this good feeling about all the things that I could be.
01:47:26.667,01:47:30.417,And then I never became any of them.
01:47:37.834,01:47:39.291,"Hey, Chris."
01:47:39.333,01:47:40.709,Hey.
01:47:40.750,01:47:43.291,"How are you doing, Jay?"
01:47:43.333,01:47:47.792,Rumor has it you signed 31 accounts for us from Pacific Bell.
01:47:47.834,01:47:48.917,"Yeah, I, uh..."
01:47:48.959,01:47:52.667,"met some guys at a ball game, got some cards I've been working."
01:47:52.709,01:47:54.917,I guess.
01:47:57.875,01:48:00.375,So...one more day.
01:48:00.417,01:48:02.667,Getting nervous?
01:48:02.709,01:48:04.834,"No, I'm-- I'm okay."
01:48:04.875,01:48:07.291,"Listen, whatever happens..."
01:48:07.333,01:48:09.834,"you've done a fantastic job, Chris."
01:48:09.875,01:48:11.792,I mean that.
01:48:11.834,01:48:14.250,Take care of yourself.
01:48:28.750,01:48:32.458,"Yes, Mr. Johnson."
01:48:32.500,01:48:37.792,"Yes, sir. Just, uh, calling to thank you very much for your support at last month's seminar."
01:48:37.834,01:48:39.792,"Uh-- Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely."
01:48:39.834,01:48:40.917,"Yes, sir."
01:48:41.875,01:48:43.667,"No, sir, that's it."
01:48:43.709,01:48:46.250,Thank you very much.
01:48:47.834,01:48:49.083,Chris.
01:48:49.125,01:48:50.667,Come.
01:49:17.834,01:49:22.208,"Hi, Chris."
01:49:22.250,01:49:24.375,Nice shirt.
01:49:24.417,01:49:25.792,Chris.
01:49:25.834,01:49:27.375,Chris.
01:49:27.417,01:49:30.667,"Chris. Sit down, please."
01:49:33.250,01:49:34.792,"I thought I'd, uh..."
01:49:34.834,01:49:36.583,wear a shirt today.
01:49:36.625,01:49:39.834,"Um...you know, being the last day and all."
01:49:39.875,01:49:40.834,"Well, thank you."
01:49:40.875,01:49:43.166,Thank you.
01:49:43.208,01:49:45.709,"But, um..."
01:49:45.750,01:49:48.709,"wear one tomorrow though, okay?"
01:49:48.750,01:49:51.792,Because tomorrow is going to be your first day.
01:49:51.834,01:49:55.917,If you'd like to work here as a broker.
01:49:56.875,01:49:59.166,"Would you like that, Chris?"
01:49:59.208,01:50:01.750,"Yes, sir."
01:50:01.792,01:50:04.083,Good. We couldn't be happier.
01:50:05.834,01:50:07.625,So...
01:50:07.667,01:50:08.875,welcome.
01:50:10.834,01:50:12.709,Was it as easy as it looked?
01:50:12.750,01:50:16.333,"No, sir. No."
01:50:16.375,01:50:17.834,Well...
01:50:17.875,01:50:20.917,"Good luck, Chris."
01:50:24.834,01:50:27.166,"Welcome, sir."
01:50:27.208,01:50:29.291,"Oh, Chris."
01:50:31.500,01:50:33.625,I almost forgot.
01:50:35.792,01:50:37.333,Thank you.
01:50:57.667,01:51:00.709,This part of my life...
01:51:00.750,01:51:02.959,This little part...
01:51:06.291,01:51:08.333,is called Happiness.
01:51:55.667,01:51:59.375,"Christopher. Come here, man."
01:52:27.750,01:52:31.542,CHRIS: So...how many...
01:52:31.583,01:52:33.542,planets are there?
01:52:33.583,01:52:35.792,Um...seven.
01:52:35.834,01:52:37.500,Mm-hm.
01:52:37.542,01:52:39.125,Nine.
01:52:39.166,01:52:41.208,Um...
01:52:41.250,01:52:43.750,Who's the king of the jungle?
01:52:43.792,01:52:46.750,Gorilla.
01:52:46.792,01:52:48.333,The gorilla?
01:52:48.375,01:52:50.166,No. Lion.
01:52:50.208,01:52:52.917,"Oh, yeah."
01:52:54.750,01:52:57.792,"Hey, Dad, listen to this."
01:52:57.834,01:52:59.125,What? Who's there?
01:52:59.166,01:53:01.250,Shelby.
01:53:06.208,01:53:07.583,"Knock, knock."
01:53:07.625,01:53:09.583,Nobody.
01:53:11.125,01:53:12.375,Nobody who?
01:53:13.792,01:53:16.125,Oh.
01:53:16.166,01:53:18.917,Now that's funny.
