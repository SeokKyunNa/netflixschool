00:00:59.280,00:01:02.600,a particularly painful part of our history.
00:01:02.640,00:01:04.040,"Yes, yes."
00:01:04.080,00:01:06.720,But it's been the way we've been able to heal.
00:01:06.760,00:01:09.080,"At first, it was a reminder of the rebellion."
00:01:09.120,00:01:11.640,It was a price the districts had to pay.
00:01:11.680,00:01:13.920,But I think it has grown from that.
00:01:13.960,00:01:17.400,I think it's something that knits us all together.
00:01:19.320,00:01:21.600,This is your third year as Gamemaker.
00:01:23.040,00:01:26.800,What defines your personal signature?
00:01:32.040,00:01:36.400,KATNISS: It's okay. It's okay.
00:01:38.240,00:01:40.640,It was me.
00:01:40.680,00:01:44.480,I know. I know.
00:01:44.520,00:01:46.760,"It's your first year, Prim."
00:01:46.800,00:01:49.240,They're not gonna pick you.
00:01:49.280,00:01:51.000,Try to go to sleep.
00:01:51.040,00:01:52.560,I can't.
00:01:52.840,00:01:56.320,Just try. Just try.
00:01:58.760,00:02:01.600,Mmm-hmm.
00:02:23.960,00:02:27.200,You remember that song? Okay.
00:02:27.240,00:02:29.000,You finish it.
00:02:29.040,00:02:30.720,Where?
00:02:30.760,00:02:32.400,I've just got to go.
00:02:32.440,00:02:35.600,But I'll be back.
00:02:43.200,00:02:45.320,I'll still cook you.
00:04:49.720,00:04:52.120,GALE: What are you gonna do with that when you kill it?
00:04:54.160,00:04:56.920,"Damn you, Gale!"
00:04:56.960,00:04:59.920,"What are you gonna do with a 100-pound deer, Catnip?"
00:04:59.960,00:05:02.480,It's Reaping Day.
00:05:02.520,00:05:05.560,I was gonna sell it to some Peacekeepers.
00:05:05.600,00:05:06.800,Of course you were.
00:05:06.840,00:05:08.080,Like you don't sell to Peacekeepers.
00:05:08.120,00:05:09.840,No. Not today.
00:05:09.880,00:05:12.400,It was the first deer I've seen in a year.
00:05:12.440,00:05:13.760,Okay.
00:06:02.160,00:06:03.640,What if they did?
00:06:03.680,00:06:04.720,What if everyone just stopped watching?
00:06:04.760,00:06:05.760,"They won't, Gale."
00:06:05.800,00:06:06.840,What if they did?
00:06:06.880,00:06:08.400,Won't happen.
00:06:08.440,00:06:10.480,You root for your favorites.
00:06:10.520,00:06:11.920,It's sick.
00:06:11.960,00:06:14.120,"If no one watches, then they don't have a game."
00:06:14.160,00:06:15.640,It's as simple as that.
00:06:15.680,00:06:17.560,What?
00:06:18.320,00:06:19.320,Fine. Laugh at me.
00:06:19.360,00:06:21.600,I'm not laughing at you.
00:06:26.760,00:06:29.160,"We could do it, you know?"
00:06:30.720,00:06:32.760,"Take off, live in the woods."
00:06:32.800,00:06:33.880,They'd catch us.
00:06:33.920,00:06:35.960,"Well, maybe not."
00:06:36.000,00:06:38.160,"Cut out our tongues, or worse."
00:06:38.200,00:06:39.440,We wouldn't make it five miles.
00:06:39.480,00:06:43.080,"No, I'd get five miles."
00:06:43.120,00:06:44.880,"KATNISS: I have Prim, and you have your brothers."
00:06:44.920,00:06:45.960,"GALE: They can come, too."
00:06:46.000,00:06:47.520,KATNISS: Prim in the woods?
00:06:49.400,00:06:51.200,Or maybe not.
00:06:52.040,00:06:54.360,I'm never having kids.
00:06:55.040,00:06:57.040,"I might, if I didn't live here."
00:06:57.080,00:06:59.680,But you do live here.
00:07:02.560,00:07:04.240,"Oh, I forgot."
00:07:04.520,00:07:05.520,Here.
00:07:05.560,00:07:08.080,"Oh, my God!"
00:07:08.120,00:07:10.160,Yeah. Better be.
00:07:12.040,00:07:13.440,Happy Hunger Games.
00:07:13.480,00:07:17.000,And may the odds be ever in your favor.
00:07:20.440,00:07:22.960,How many times is your name in today?
00:07:23.000,00:07:25.200,Forty-two.
00:07:25.240,00:07:28.640,Guess the odds aren't exactly in my favor.
00:07:54.000,00:07:55.920,"Thank you, girl."
00:08:03.400,00:08:04.960,What's this?
00:08:05.000,00:08:07.520,That's a Mockingjay.
00:08:09.200,00:08:10.720,How much?
00:08:12.360,00:08:14.120,You keep it. It's yours.
00:08:14.160,00:08:15.520,Thank you.
00:08:27.480,00:08:28.760,Mom.
00:08:30.400,00:08:32.080,"KATNISS: Aw, look at you!"
00:08:32.600,00:08:34.560,You look beautiful.
00:08:34.600,00:08:36.760,"But you better tuck in that tail, little duck."
00:08:36.800,00:08:38.720,"I laid something out for you, too."
00:08:41.080,00:08:42.440,Okay.
00:09:05.920,00:09:07.640,"Now you look beautiful, too."
00:09:07.680,00:09:09.640,Wish I looked like you.
00:09:09.680,00:09:13.480,"Oh, no. I wish I looked like you, little duck."
00:09:19.080,00:09:22.280,Hey. You want to see what I got you today?
00:09:24.560,00:09:28.120,It's a Mockingjay pin.
00:09:28.840,00:09:32.840,"And as long as you have it, nothing bad will happen to you."
00:09:32.880,00:09:35.280,Okay? I promise.
00:10:28.640,00:10:30.200,Shh. Shh.
00:10:30.240,00:10:32.040,"Prim, it's okay."
00:10:32.080,00:10:33.800,Okay. It's time to sign in now. Okay?
00:10:33.840,00:10:35.960,They're gonna prick your finger just to take a little bit of blood.
00:10:36.000,00:10:37.120,You didn't say...
00:10:37.160,00:10:39.200,It doesn't hurt much.
00:10:39.240,00:10:42.720,Okay? Go sit down there with the little kids.
00:10:42.760,00:10:44.040,WOMAN: Next.
00:10:44.080,00:10:45.280,Next.
00:10:56.960,00:10:59.360,Go ahead. Next.
00:10:59.960,00:11:01.160,Next.
00:11:11.560,00:11:12.760,Next.
00:11:15.040,00:11:16.680,Next.
00:11:50.560,00:11:54.040,"Welcome! Welcome, welcome."
00:11:54.440,00:11:56.240,Happy Hunger Games.
00:11:56.280,00:12:01.280,And may the odds be ever in your favor.
00:12:02.240,00:12:05.960,"Now, before we begin, we have a very special film."
00:12:06.000,00:12:09.720,Brought to you all the way from The Capitol.
00:12:12.720,00:12:15.680,War. Terrible war.
00:12:16.640,00:12:18.280,PRESIDENT SNOW: War.
00:12:18.320,00:12:23.600,Terrible war.
00:12:23.640,00:12:26.880,This was the uprising that rocked our land.
00:12:26.920,00:12:33.040,"Thirteen districts rebelled against the country that fed them, loved them, protected them."
00:12:33.080,00:12:37.040,Brother turned on brother until nothing remained.
00:12:37.080,00:12:40.960,"And then came the peace, hard fought, sorely won."
00:12:41.000,00:12:46.320,"A people rose up from the ashes, and a new era was born."
00:12:46.360,00:12:49.920,But freedom has a cost.
00:12:49.960,00:12:54.400,We swore as a nation we would never know this treason again.
00:12:54.440,00:13:08.080,"And so it was decreed that each year the various districts of Panem would offer up, in tribute, one young man and woman to fight to the death in a pageant of honor, courage, and sacrifice."
00:13:08.120,00:13:15.280,"The lone victor, bathed in riches, would serve as a reminder of our generosity and our forgiveness."
00:13:15.320,00:13:18.320,This is how we remember our past.
00:13:18.360,00:13:21.880,This is how we safeguard our future.
00:13:21.920,00:13:23.800,I just love that!
00:13:25.960,00:13:41.480,"Now, the time has come for us to select one courageous young man and woman for the honor of representing District 12 in the 74th Annual Hunger Games."
00:13:42.360,00:13:46.560,"As usual, ladies first."
00:14:10.240,00:14:12.760,Primrose Everdeen.
00:14:19.240,00:14:21.240,"Where are you, dear?"
00:14:21.280,00:14:23.120,Come on up.
00:14:23.880,00:14:25.840,"Well, come on up."
00:14:46.720,00:14:49.040,Prim! Prim!
00:14:49.560,00:14:50.560,No. No!
00:14:50.600,00:14:53.200,I volunteer! I volunteer!
00:14:54.080,00:14:55.600,I volunteer as Tribute!
00:14:57.480,00:15:01.320,"I believe we have a volunteer, Mr. Mayor."
00:15:01.360,00:15:03.280,"Prim, you need to get out of here."
00:15:03.320,00:15:04.720,No! No!
00:15:04.760,00:15:06.280,"Prim, go find Mom right now."
00:15:06.320,00:15:09.680,"Go find Mom. Prim, leave!"
00:15:09.720,00:15:13.240,Come on.
00:15:13.280,00:15:17.120,EFFIE: A dramatic turn of events here in District 12.
00:15:17.600,00:15:19.080,"Yes, well."
00:15:19.120,00:15:23.800,District 12's very first volunteer.
00:15:26.880,00:15:28.600,"Come on, dear."
00:15:37.680,00:15:39.080,What's your name?
00:15:39.120,00:15:41.400,KATNISS: Katniss Everdeen.
00:15:41.440,00:15:45.360,"EFFIE: Well, I bet my hat that was your sister, wasn't it?"
00:15:45.720,00:15:47.840,Yes.
00:15:47.880,00:15:54.520,"Let's have a big hand for our very first volunteer, Katniss Everdeen."
00:16:05.600,00:16:09.280,And now for the boys.
00:16:18.320,00:16:19.760,Peeta Mellark.
00:16:42.560,00:16:44.240,Here we are.
00:16:44.280,00:16:48.480,Our Tributes from District 12.
00:16:48.520,00:16:50.760,"Well, go on, you two, shake hands."
00:17:03.000,00:17:04.920,Happy Hunger Games.
00:17:04.960,00:17:10.000,And may the odds be ever in your favor.
00:17:21.600,00:17:23.880,PEACEKEEPER: You have three minutes.
00:17:26.920,00:17:28.400,It's okay.
00:17:28.440,00:17:32.440,Shh. Prim. Prim. It's okay.
00:17:32.480,00:17:35.440,Prim. Listen.
00:17:35.480,00:17:37.240,Don't take any extra food from them.
00:17:37.280,00:17:39.040,It isn't worth putting your name in more times. Okay?
00:17:39.080,00:17:41.360,"Listen, Prim."
00:17:41.400,00:17:43.240,You can sell cheese from your goat.
00:17:43.880,00:17:45.840,Just try to win.
00:17:46.160,00:17:48.040,Of course.
00:17:48.080,00:17:50.360,And maybe I can.
00:17:50.400,00:17:53.760,And you can hunt.
00:17:59.280,00:18:01.120,PRIM: To protect you.
00:18:05.960,00:18:07.600,Thank you.
00:18:20.000,00:18:22.360,You can't tune out again.
00:18:22.520,00:18:23.520,I won't.
00:18:23.560,00:18:25.760,"No, you can't."
00:18:25.800,00:18:27.560,I won't be there anymore.
00:18:27.600,00:18:31.120,"No matter what you feel, you have to be there for her."
00:18:32.000,00:18:33.640,Don't cry.
00:18:36.160,00:18:39.400,Don't cry. Don't. Don't.
00:18:41.120,00:18:42.800,PEACEKEEPER: It's time.
00:18:42.840,00:18:46.600,"Prim, it's okay."
00:18:46.640,00:18:48.120,"I promise, Prim."
00:19:04.720,00:19:06.800,I'm fine.
00:19:06.840,00:19:08.800,I am.
00:19:08.840,00:19:12.680,Listen to me.
00:19:12.720,00:19:14.000,Get to a bow.
00:19:14.040,00:19:16.200,They will if you show them how good you are.
00:19:16.240,00:19:18.320,They just want a good show.
00:19:18.360,00:19:20.160,"If they don't have a bow, then you make one, okay?"
00:19:20.200,00:19:21.680,You know how to hunt.
00:19:21.720,00:19:23.200,Animals.
00:19:24.600,00:19:25.840,"It's no different, Katniss."
00:19:27.720,00:19:30.600,"There's 24 of us, Gale."
00:19:30.640,00:19:33.280,Yeah. And it's gonna be you.
00:19:33.400,00:19:35.000,Okay.
00:19:35.040,00:19:36.400,"Take care of them, Gale."
00:19:36.440,00:19:37.440,PEACEKEEPER: Let's go.
00:19:37.480,00:19:38.720,"I'll see you soon, okay?"
00:19:41.720,00:19:43.240,You two are in for a treat.
00:19:43.280,00:19:46.840,"Crystal chandeliers, platinum doorknobs, and it flies."
00:19:46.880,00:19:49.040,We'll be at The Capitol in less than two days.
00:19:49.080,00:19:51.480,"Now, before you do anything else..."
00:20:45.320,00:20:48.040,"EFFIE: 200 miles per hour, and you can barely feel a thing."
00:20:48.080,00:20:57.360,"I think it's one of the wonderful things about this opportunity, that even though you're here and even though it's just for a little while, you get to enjoy all of this."
00:21:00.200,00:21:05.560,I'm going to find Haymitch.
00:21:16.280,00:21:18.280,Have you ever met him?
00:21:20.520,00:21:22.040,Haymitch?
00:21:26.040,00:21:30.840,"You know, Katniss, he is our mentor."
00:21:36.400,00:21:42.680,"Look, you know, if you don't want to talk, I understand, but I just don't think there's anything wrong with getting a little bit of help."
00:22:05.760,00:22:07.680,Congratulations.
00:22:25.440,00:22:27.400,Where's the ice?
00:22:28.800,00:22:30.080,I don't know.
00:22:35.760,00:22:37.320,May I?
00:22:41.760,00:22:45.760,"Okay, so..."
00:22:45.800,00:22:48.600,Whoa. So eager.
00:22:48.640,00:22:51.440,Most of you aren't in such a hurry.
00:22:51.480,00:22:53.680,Yeah. I wanna know what the plan is.
00:22:53.720,00:22:55.320,You're supposed to go...
00:22:56.080,00:22:57.680,"Yeah, our mentor."
00:22:57.720,00:23:00.400,You're supposed to tell us how to get sponsors and give us advice.
00:23:00.560,00:23:03.280,Oh. Okay. Um...
00:23:03.320,00:23:08.200,Embrace the probability of your imminent death.
00:23:08.240,00:23:15.040,"And know, in your heart, that there's nothing I can do to save you."
00:23:15.080,00:23:17.240,So why are you here then?
00:23:17.800,00:23:19.120,The refreshments.
00:23:19.160,00:23:20.720,"Okay, I think that's enough of that."
00:23:24.840,00:23:29.680,You made me spill my drink.
00:23:29.720,00:23:34.320,"You know, I think I'll go finish this in my room."
00:23:48.880,00:23:50.560,He's gonna come around.
00:23:50.600,00:23:51.720,It's no use.
00:23:51.760,00:23:54.040,I'm gonna go talk to him.
00:24:00.320,00:24:03.280,CLAUDIUS ON TV: We have two very fit 16-year-olds.
00:24:03.320,00:24:06.520,"CAESAR: Of course, of course."
00:24:06.560,00:24:08.320,"CLAUDIUS: Yes, yes, they do."
00:24:08.360,00:24:09.840,CAESAR: Do you remember this year?
00:24:09.880,00:24:13.320,One of my favorite years.
00:24:13.360,00:24:16.400,The use of the rubble in the ruined city...
00:24:16.440,00:24:17.480,CLAUDIUS: Very exciting.
00:24:17.520,00:24:21.680,"CAESAR: And this moment here, this moment is a moment that you never forget."
00:24:21.720,00:24:23.200,CLAUDIUS: Yes.
00:24:23.240,00:24:26.760,CAESAR: The moment when a Tribute becomes a victor.
00:24:59.720,00:25:01.280,You'd freeze to death first.
00:25:01.320,00:25:02.520,"No, because I'd light a fire."
00:25:02.560,00:25:04.200,That's a good way to get killed.
00:25:04.240,00:25:06.120,What's a good way to get killed?
00:25:06.960,00:25:10.200,"Oh, joy."
00:25:10.240,00:25:13.600,some life-saving advice.
00:25:14.680,00:25:15.800,Like what?
00:25:15.840,00:25:18.520,I was just asking about how to find shelter.
00:25:18.560,00:25:22.960,"Which would come in handy if, in fact, you were still alive."
00:25:24.360,00:25:26.160,How do you find shelter?
00:25:27.840,00:25:29.680,How do you find shelter?
00:25:29.720,00:25:32.760,"Give me a chance to wake up, sweetheart."
00:25:33.520,00:25:38.200,This mentoring is very taxing stuff.
00:25:42.880,00:25:44.800,Can you pass the marmalade?
00:25:45.960,00:25:48.400,That is mahogany!
00:25:48.440,00:25:52.600,Look at you.
00:25:53.160,00:25:55.920,You really want to know how to stay alive?
00:25:56.680,00:25:58.960,You get people to like you.
00:26:00.200,00:26:01.360,Oh.
00:26:01.400,00:26:04.200,Not what you were expecting?
00:26:04.240,00:26:15.720,"Well, when you're in the middle of The Games and you're starving or freezing, some water, a knife, or even some matches can mean the difference between life and death."
00:26:15.760,00:26:19.160,And those things only come from sponsors.
00:26:19.200,00:26:24.520,"And to get sponsors, you have to make people like you."
00:26:24.560,00:26:30.280,"And right now, sweetheart, you're not off to a real good start."
00:26:30.320,00:26:32.000,There it is.
00:26:36.720,00:26:38.360,It's huge!
00:26:39.000,00:26:40.920,That's incredible.
00:27:04.240,00:27:06.000,"Peeta, I love you."
00:27:13.840,00:27:16.560,Come on. Come on.
00:27:20.720,00:27:25.000,You better keep this knife.
00:27:34.640,00:27:38.960,"CAESAR: So now that you've seen them, what do you think about this year's crop of recruits?"
00:27:39.000,00:27:42.080,Are there any surprises that we can expect this year?
00:27:42.120,00:27:47.000,"It's really hard to tell just from a Reaping, but I think this is a very interesting mix."
00:27:47.040,00:27:52.080,"And whenever you have a volunteer from an outlying district, that's something you can't ignore."
00:28:17.840,00:28:19.240,KATNISS: What's that?
00:28:20.120,00:28:21.640,What's that?
00:28:21.680,00:28:26.120,We're just saying we might need to hose you down again before we take you to Cinna.
00:28:32.680,00:28:34.800,That was one of the bravest things I've ever seen.
00:28:34.840,00:28:36.440,With your sister?
00:28:36.480,00:28:38.560,My name's Cinna.
00:28:38.600,00:28:43.040,"I'm sorry that this happened to you, and I'm here to help you in any way that I can."
00:28:44.920,00:28:47.080,Most people just congratulate me.
00:28:47.120,00:28:49.720,"Well, I don't see the point in that."
00:28:50.480,00:28:53.800,"So tonight, they have the Tribute Parade."
00:28:53.840,00:28:56.960,I'm gonna take you out and show you off to the world.
00:28:57.000,00:28:58.720,So you're here to make me look pretty?
00:28:58.760,00:29:01.400,I'm here to help you make an impression.
00:29:01.440,00:29:03.880,"Now, usually they dress people in the clothes from their district."
00:29:03.920,00:29:04.960,"Yeah, we're always coalminers."
00:29:05.000,00:29:06.480,"Yeah, but I don't wanna do that."
00:29:07.440,00:29:09.560,I wanna do something that they're gonna remember.
00:29:09.600,00:29:12.400,Did they explain about trying to get sponsors?
00:29:12.440,00:29:14.960,"Yeah, but I'm not very good at making friends."
00:29:15.000,00:29:16.680,We'll see.
00:29:17.920,00:29:26.000,"I just think somebody that brave shouldn't be dressed up in some stupid costume, now should they?"
00:29:27.360,00:29:29.040,I hope not.
00:29:35.560,00:29:37.640,"Okay, this is safe."
00:29:37.680,00:29:40.840,It's not real fire.
00:29:40.880,00:29:42.120,Looks pretty real to me.
00:29:42.160,00:29:43.720,"Well, that's the idea."
00:29:43.760,00:29:44.840,You ready?
00:29:44.880,00:29:47.760,Don't be afraid.
00:30:06.640,00:30:11.880,"Over 100,000 people craning to get a glimpse of this year's Tributes."
00:30:11.920,00:30:14.840,And the sponsors get to see the Tributes for the first time.
00:30:14.880,00:30:18.400,The importance of this moment cannot be overstated.
00:30:22.480,00:30:24.120,Very nice.
00:30:24.160,00:30:29.960,"First chariot on my count, in 15, 14, 13..."
00:30:31.280,00:30:35.080,CLAUDIUS: There they are.
00:30:35.120,00:30:36.600,CAESAR: It's the most exciting part.
00:30:36.640,00:30:38.520,CLAUDIUS: It just gives you goose bumps.
00:30:38.560,00:30:45.240,"CAESAR: And don't you love how the stylists, they so clearly are able to reflect the character of each district?"
00:30:45.280,00:30:48.640,CLAUDIUS: Right. Right.
00:30:48.680,00:30:49.920,Fishing.
00:30:49.960,00:30:52.280,I like it.
00:30:52.320,00:30:56.840,"And behind them, we have two power plant workers. Right?"
00:30:56.880,00:30:59.000,And then...
00:30:59.040,00:31:01.960,What is that in the background?
00:31:27.040,00:31:28.480,Come on. They'll love it.
00:31:35.000,00:31:36.200,Yeah!
00:31:36.240,00:31:37.920,CAESAR: Now see that?
00:31:37.960,00:31:43.920,"Two young people holding their hands up, saying, I'm proud I come from District 12."
00:31:43.960,00:31:45.680,Nope.
00:31:45.720,00:31:48.240,People are sure gonna be paying attention to them right now.
00:31:49.880,00:31:51.840,And we're ready.
00:31:51.880,00:31:53.560,"President Snow, you're live."
00:32:22.320,00:32:24.000,PRESIDENT SNOW: Welcome.
00:32:27.240,00:32:28.960,Welcome.
00:32:29.840,00:32:33.320,"Tributes, we welcome you."
00:32:34.600,00:32:40.880,We salute your courage and your sacrifice.
00:32:43.720,00:32:49.320,And we wish you Happy Hunger Games.
00:32:49.360,00:32:54.120,And may the odds be ever in your favor.
00:33:05.120,00:33:07.200,That was amazing.
00:33:07.240,00:33:09.960,EFFIE: We are all anybody's going to be talking about.
00:33:10.000,00:33:11.320,So brave.
00:33:11.360,00:33:13.480,Are you sure you should be near an open flame?
00:33:13.520,00:33:17.520,Fake flame?
00:33:25.480,00:33:28.400,Let's go upstairs.
00:33:31.400,00:33:33.480,"EFFIE: So, each of the districts get their own floor."
00:33:33.520,00:33:37.680,"And because you're from 12, you get the penthouse."
00:33:43.760,00:33:45.320,Come on.
00:33:48.720,00:33:51.360,So this is the living room.
00:33:51.600,00:33:54.320,"I know, I know."
00:33:54.360,00:33:57.000,"Now, your rooms are right over here."
00:33:57.040,00:34:01.520,Why don't you go clean yourselves up a little before dinner?
00:35:14.880,00:35:18.720,"ATALA: In two weeks, 23 of you will be dead."
00:35:18.760,00:35:20.680,One of you will be alive.
00:35:20.720,00:35:27.520,"Who that is depends on how well you pay attention over the next four days, particularly to what I'm about to say."
00:35:27.560,00:35:30.600,"First, no fighting with the other Tributes."
00:35:30.640,00:35:32.960,You'll have plenty of time for that in the Arena.
00:35:33.000,00:35:35.280,There are four compulsory exercises.
00:35:35.320,00:35:37.200,The rest will be individual training.
00:35:37.240,00:35:40.160,My advice is don't ignore the survival skills.
00:35:40.200,00:35:44.520,"Everybody wants to grab a sword, but most of you will die from natural causes."
00:35:44.560,00:35:48.280,"10% from infection, 20% from dehydration."
00:35:48.320,00:35:51.720,Exposure can kill as easily as a knife.
00:36:21.840,00:36:24.200,"CATO: Jason, where's my knife, huh?"
00:36:24.240,00:36:25.440,I put my knife right there!
00:36:25.480,00:36:26.760,Don't touch me.
00:36:26.800,00:36:28.320,"Yes, you took my knife!"
00:36:28.360,00:36:29.920,"You took my knife, you liar!"
00:36:29.960,00:36:31.160,You liar!
00:36:31.200,00:36:33.120,CATO: You little punk!
00:36:33.160,00:36:34.880,Get off me!
00:36:34.920,00:36:37.400,"CATO: I'll finish you right now, kid!"
00:36:37.440,00:36:39.160,"CATO: Actually, better yet, I'll wait for the Arena."
00:36:39.200,00:36:41.000,"You're the first one I get, so watch your back, huh?"
00:36:44.280,00:36:45.360,"ATALA: Everybody, back in line!"
00:36:45.400,00:36:47.080,"You know who you're messing with, kid!"
00:36:47.120,00:36:49.440,HAYMITCH: He's a Career.
00:36:49.480,00:36:51.760,From District 1.
00:36:51.800,00:36:55.160,They train in a special academy until they're 18.
00:36:55.200,00:36:58.320,"By that point, they're pretty lethal."
00:36:58.360,00:37:00.400,But they don't receive any special treatment.
00:37:00.440,00:37:02.920,"In fact, they stay in the exact same apartment as you do."
00:37:02.960,00:37:06.600,And I don't think they let them have dessert.
00:37:07.000,00:37:09.600,So how good are they?
00:37:09.640,00:37:12.960,Obviously they're pretty good.
00:37:13.000,00:37:14.400,Almost.
00:37:14.440,00:37:16.880,...they can be arrogant.
00:37:16.920,00:37:21.120,And arrogance can be a big problem.
00:37:22.520,00:37:24.920,I hear you can shoot.
00:37:27.080,00:37:28.280,I'm all right.
00:37:28.320,00:37:29.920,"No, she's better than all right."
00:37:29.960,00:37:32.120,My father buys her squirrels.
00:37:32.160,00:37:35.360,He says she hits them right in the eye every time.
00:37:36.440,00:37:38.320,Peeta's strong.
00:37:38.360,00:37:40.640,He can throw a 100-pound sack of flour right over his head. I've seen it.
00:37:40.680,00:37:42.960,"Okay, well, I'm not gonna kill anybody with a sack of flour."
00:37:43.000,00:37:46.040,"No, but you might have a better chance of winning if somebody comes after you with a knife."
00:37:46.080,00:37:49.560,I have no chance of winning!
00:37:54.360,00:37:57.400,It's true.
00:37:59.840,00:38:02.120,You know what my mother said?
00:38:02.160,00:38:05.720,She said District 12 might finally have a winner.
00:38:05.760,00:38:07.680,But she wasn't talking about me.
00:38:08.680,00:38:11.120,She was talking about you.
00:38:15.840,00:38:17.960,I'm not very hungry.
00:38:53.960,00:38:55.360,"I'm done, too."
00:39:36.520,00:39:38.200,Throw that metal thing over there.
00:39:38.240,00:39:39.600,What?
00:39:41.880,00:39:44.400,No. Haymitch said we're not supposed to show our skills.
00:39:44.440,00:39:45.640,I don't care what Haymitch said.
00:39:45.680,00:39:47.440,Those guys are looking at you like you're a meal.
00:39:47.480,00:39:48.800,Throw it.
00:40:31.720,00:40:32.960,KATNISS: Hi.
00:40:33.640,00:40:34.920,Hey.
00:40:34.960,00:40:36.760,How did you do that?
00:40:36.800,00:40:40.800,I used to decorate the cakes down at the bakery.
00:40:40.920,00:40:42.600,Oh.
00:40:44.720,00:40:46.000,See?
00:40:46.880,00:40:48.720,Wow.
00:40:50.280,00:40:52.600,"Hey, I think you have a shadow."
00:41:16.920,00:41:21.520,"Tomorrow, they'll bring you in one by one and evaluate you."
00:41:21.560,00:41:25.000,"This is important, because higher ratings will mean sponsors."
00:41:25.040,00:41:27.520,This is the time to show them everything.
00:41:27.560,00:41:30.280,There'll be a bow.
00:41:30.320,00:41:32.680,"Peeta, you make sure to show your strength."
00:41:32.720,00:41:36.920,"They'll start with District 1, so the two of you will go last."
00:41:37.360,00:41:39.200,I don't know how else to put this.
00:41:39.240,00:41:41.080,Make sure they remember you.
00:41:51.760,00:41:54.440,ELECTRONIC VOICE: Katniss Everdeen.
00:42:05.080,00:42:06.840,"Hey, Katniss?"
00:42:07.040,00:42:09.200,Shoot straight.
00:43:06.640,00:43:08.600,Katniss Everdeen.
00:43:09.520,00:43:11.600,District 12.
00:44:34.480,00:44:35.800,"Hey, hey, hey."
00:44:35.840,00:44:39.080,"Hey, who ordered this pig?"
00:44:39.120,00:44:40.680,Did you get some pig yet?
00:44:57.600,00:45:00.760,Thank you for your consideration.
00:45:05.840,00:45:07.800,Are you crazy?
00:45:07.840,00:45:09.560,Mad?
00:45:09.600,00:45:14.480,You realize that your actions reflect badly on all of us.
00:45:14.520,00:45:16.040,They just want a good show. It's fine.
00:45:16.080,00:45:19.560,"How about it's just bad manners, Cinna!"
00:45:19.600,00:45:24.920,"Well, finally!"
00:45:27.520,00:45:29.680,"Nice shooting, sweetheart."
00:45:30.840,00:45:35.600,What did they do when you shot the apple?
00:45:35.640,00:45:37.280,"Well, they looked pretty startled."
00:45:37.320,00:45:38.400,"Oh, yeah."
00:45:40.760,00:45:42.840,"Now, what did you say?"
00:45:42.880,00:45:44.440,Thanks for your consideration.
00:45:44.480,00:45:46.760,Genius! Genius.
00:45:46.800,00:45:51.280,I don't think we're gonna find this funny if the Gamemakers decide to take it out...
00:45:51.320,00:45:53.080,On who? On her?
00:45:53.600,00:45:55.480,On him?
00:45:55.520,00:45:58.520,I think they already have.
00:45:58.920,00:46:02.080,I would have given anything to see it.
00:46:02.120,00:46:08.000,"As you know, the Tributes were rated on a scale of 1 to 12 after three days of careful evaluation."
00:46:08.040,00:46:11.960,The Gamekeepers would like to acknowledge that it was an exceptional...
00:46:12.000,00:46:16.720,"From District 1, Marvel, with a score of nine."
00:46:16.760,00:46:20.200,"From District 2, Cato, with a score of 10."
00:46:20.240,00:46:22.400,"Clove, with a score of 10."
00:46:22.440,00:46:25.560,From District 3...
00:46:25.600,00:46:26.960,From District 7...
00:46:27.000,00:46:29.240,From District 8...
00:46:29.280,00:46:31.880,And Rue with a score of seven.
00:46:31.920,00:46:33.600,Now our final district.
00:46:33.640,00:46:39.240,From District 12.
00:46:41.920,00:46:44.400,A score of eight.
00:46:45.600,00:46:46.880,CINNA: Excellent.
00:46:46.920,00:46:48.000,CINNA: Bravo.
00:46:48.040,00:46:50.680,We can work with that.
00:46:52.760,00:47:02.200,"CAESAR: And finally, from District 12, Katniss Everdeen."
00:47:05.120,00:47:07.120,With a score of...
00:47:09.640,00:47:10.760,Eleven.
00:47:12.280,00:47:14.760,Katniss!
00:47:14.800,00:47:16.200,Yes!
00:47:16.440,00:47:18.160,Congratulations.
00:47:18.200,00:47:19.400,I thought they hated me.
00:47:19.440,00:47:20.720,They must have liked your guts.
00:47:20.760,00:47:25.320,"To Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!"
00:47:25.360,00:47:27.600,Goodness. We are.
00:47:27.640,00:47:29.200,An 11?
00:47:29.240,00:47:30.440,She earned it.
00:47:30.480,00:47:32.320,She shot an arrow at your head.
00:47:32.360,00:47:33.600,"Well, at an apple."
00:47:33.640,00:47:35.120,Near your head.
00:47:35.480,00:47:37.120,Sit down.
00:47:41.840,00:47:45.560,"Seneca, why do you think we have a winner?"
00:47:47.200,00:47:49.320,What do you mean?
00:47:49.360,00:47:53.880,"I mean, why do we have a winner?"
00:47:55.440,00:48:01.800,"I mean, if we just wanted to intimidate the districts, why not round up 24 of them at random and execute them all at once?"
00:48:01.840,00:48:03.960,Be a lot faster.
00:48:05.720,00:48:07.040,Hope.
00:48:07.640,00:48:08.800,Hope?
00:48:08.840,00:48:10.480,Hope.
00:48:10.520,00:48:14.440,It is the only thing stronger than fear.
00:48:15.080,00:48:18.800,A little hope is effective.
00:48:18.840,00:48:22.800,"A spark is fine, as long as it's contained."
00:48:24.360,00:48:25.560,So...
00:48:26.560,00:48:30.080,So contain it.
00:48:31.680,00:48:33.240,Right.
00:48:33.280,00:48:34.800,EFFIE: So she's staring at all my jewels.
00:48:34.840,00:48:36.080,She cannot take her eyes off of them.
00:48:36.120,00:48:37.280,"CINNA: Well, look at all that that you're wearing."
00:48:37.320,00:48:38.400,"EFFIE: Frankly, it was rude."
00:48:38.440,00:48:39.440,Oh!
00:48:39.480,00:48:41.040,"Haymitch, you should join us."
00:48:41.080,00:48:43.480,We're having some of your favorite for dinner.
00:48:43.520,00:48:44.880,"Oh, lovely."
00:48:48.560,00:48:50.440,Where's Peeta?
00:48:50.480,00:48:54.200,"Now, listen, tomorrow's the last day."
00:48:54.240,00:49:00.160,"And they let us work with our own Tributes right before The Games, so you and I will be going down at 9:00."
00:49:01.000,00:49:03.000,What about him?
00:49:03.040,00:49:07.240,He says he wants to be trained on his own from now on.
00:49:07.560,00:49:09.120,What?
00:49:09.160,00:49:11.000,This kind of thing does happen at this point.
00:49:11.040,00:49:14.640,"There's only one winner, right?"
00:49:20.120,00:49:22.200,We should have some chocolate-covered strawberries.
00:49:22.240,00:49:24.440,"PORTIA: Oh, my, yes."
00:49:26.920,00:49:33.120,"ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, your master of ceremonies, Caesar Flickerman!"
00:49:35.560,00:49:40.640,Thank you! Thank you!
00:49:40.680,00:49:46.360,"Welcome, welcome, welcome to the 74th Annual Hunger Games!"
00:49:48.440,00:49:51.480,"Now, in about five minutes, they're all going to be out here."
00:49:51.520,00:49:54.080,All of the Tributes that you've heard about.
00:49:54.120,00:49:55.760,Are you excited?
00:49:56.320,00:49:58.160,Let me hear it!
00:50:01.000,00:50:02.480,CINNA: Amazing.
00:50:03.840,00:50:05.320,I don't feel amazing.
00:50:05.360,00:50:07.240,Don't you know how beautiful you look?
00:50:07.280,00:50:09.080,No. And I don't know how to make people like me.
00:50:09.120,00:50:10.320,How do you make people like you?
00:50:10.360,00:50:11.600,"Well, you made me like you."
00:50:11.640,00:50:13.080,That's different.
00:50:13.120,00:50:17.160,"Exactly. Just be yourself, I'll be there the whole time."
00:50:17.200,00:50:20.560,And just pretend that you're talking to me. Okay?
00:50:20.600,00:50:21.840,Okay.
00:50:21.880,00:50:23.600,Let's see if she does indeed shine.
00:50:23.640,00:50:27.760,Let's have a warm round of applause for Glimmer!
00:50:31.360,00:50:33.080,"Glimmer, are you prepared?"
00:50:33.120,00:50:35.160,"Yes, Caesar, I am very prepared."
00:50:35.200,00:50:37.880,I like it. That's assurance.
00:50:37.920,00:50:39.240,Don't you think?
00:50:39.280,00:50:41.280,...I'm wearing one of our own creations.
00:50:41.760,00:50:44.080,A big round of applause!
00:50:46.160,00:50:47.160,Marvel!
00:50:47.200,00:50:48.400,Whoo!
00:50:50.360,00:50:51.920,"Welcome, Clove."
00:50:51.960,00:50:53.680,It's an honor representing my district.
00:50:53.720,00:50:56.640,I'm prepared.
00:50:57.200,00:50:58.920,Cato!
00:50:58.960,00:51:03.560,"I find that if I can apply myself to the situation present, I will be able to figure it out."
00:51:03.600,00:51:07.360,Thank you.
00:51:09.360,00:51:11.320,Good. So you can climb trees.
00:51:11.360,00:51:13.760,You're pretty quick.
00:51:13.800,00:51:15.560,A gatherer?
00:51:22.200,00:51:24.760,"From District 12, District 12..."
00:51:24.800,00:51:27.960,You know her as The Girl on Fire!
00:51:30.520,00:51:34.240,"Well, we know her as the lovely Katniss Everdeen!"
00:51:53.480,00:51:55.400,Welcome.
00:51:55.440,00:51:59.680,"Well, that was quite an entrance you made the other day."
00:52:01.880,00:52:03.200,What?
00:52:04.520,00:52:07.040,I think someone's a little nervous.
00:52:08.280,00:52:12.800,I said that was quite an entrance that you made at the Tribute Parade the other day.
00:52:12.840,00:52:15.720,Do you want to tell us about it?
00:52:15.760,00:52:19.640,"Well, I was just hoping that I wouldn't burn to death."
00:52:27.280,00:52:32.560,"When you came out of that chariot, I have to say, my heart stopped."
00:52:32.600,00:52:35.080,Did any of you experience this as well?
00:52:35.120,00:52:36.800,My heart stopped.
00:52:39.320,00:52:41.040,So did mine.
00:52:43.200,00:52:45.560,"Now, tell me about the flames."
00:52:45.600,00:52:46.960,Yes.
00:52:51.120,00:52:55.720,"In fact, I'm wearing them today."
00:52:55.960,00:52:58.520,"Wait, wait, wait. Is it safe?"
00:52:58.560,00:53:00.080,Yes.
00:53:00.120,00:53:01.520,"What do you think, folks?"
00:53:01.560,00:53:03.200,AUDIENCE: Yeah!
00:53:03.240,00:53:04.520,I think that's a yes.
00:53:29.840,00:53:32.920,Steady. Steady.
00:53:33.280,00:53:35.000,Lovely. Thank you.
00:53:37.040,00:53:40.160,That was really something.
00:53:40.200,00:53:43.040,That was something.
00:53:44.600,00:53:47.480,I have one more question for you.
00:53:48.400,00:53:50.160,It's about your sister.
00:53:52.400,00:53:59.400,"We were all very moved, I think, when you volunteered for her at the Reaping."
00:54:00.240,00:54:02.720,Did she come and say goodbye to you?
00:54:02.760,00:54:04.160,Yes.
00:54:04.200,00:54:06.240,She did.
00:54:08.560,00:54:12.200,And what did you say to her in the end?
00:54:14.400,00:54:17.400,I told her that I would try to win.
00:54:18.160,00:54:21.000,That I would try to win for her.
00:54:21.280,00:54:23.280,Of course you did.
00:54:24.600,00:54:26.560,And try you will.
00:54:27.400,00:54:33.680,"Ladies and gentlemen, from District 12, Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!"
00:54:39.280,00:54:41.360,"You did it, darling."
00:54:41.400,00:54:42.840,Thank you.
00:54:42.880,00:54:45.800,"Nice job, sweetheart."
00:54:45.960,00:54:47.200,Thank you.
00:54:47.240,00:54:49.160,"Nice dress, too."
00:54:49.800,00:54:51.040,Not yours.
00:54:51.080,00:54:53.920,CAESAR: Please welcome Peeta Mellark!
00:54:59.440,00:55:01.480,"Peeta, welcome."
00:55:01.520,00:55:05.240,How are you finding The Capitol?
00:55:05.280,00:55:07.800,It's different.
00:55:07.840,00:55:10.640,Different. In what way?
00:55:10.680,00:55:13.200,"Okay. Well, the showers here are weird."
00:55:13.240,00:55:14.400,The showers?
00:55:14.440,00:55:16.040,We have different showers.
00:55:16.080,00:55:17.480,"PEETA: I have a question for you, Caesar."
00:55:17.520,00:55:20.440,Do I smell like roses to you?
00:55:21.520,00:55:24.200,Take a whiff?
00:55:25.360,00:55:27.440,You see?
00:55:33.600,00:55:34.880,You definitely smell better than I do.
00:55:34.920,00:55:36.000,"Well, I've lived here longer."
00:55:36.040,00:55:37.560,That makes sense.
00:55:41.360,00:55:44.720,Very funny.
00:55:41.360,00:55:47.640,"So, Peeta, tell me, is there a special girl back home?"
00:55:47.680,00:55:49.400,No. No. Not really.
00:55:49.440,00:55:53.360,No? I don't believe it for a second.
00:55:53.400,00:55:58.160,Handsome man like you.
00:55:59.480,00:56:01.360,"Well, there..."
00:56:01.400,00:56:05.640,There is this one girl that I've had a crush on forever.
00:56:05.680,00:56:10.600,But I don't think she actually recognized me until the Reaping.
00:56:11.960,00:56:14.560,"Well, I'll tell you what, Peeta."
00:56:15.480,00:56:22.880,"You go out there and you win this thing, and when you get home, she'll have to go out with you."
00:56:22.920,00:56:24.160,"Right, folks?"
00:56:27.120,00:56:30.640,"Thanks, but I don't think winning's gonna help me at all."
00:56:30.680,00:56:32.360,And why not?
00:56:35.440,00:56:38.120,Because she came here with me.
00:56:41.640,00:56:43.600,"Well, that's bad luck."
00:56:43.640,00:56:45.400,"Yeah, it is."
00:56:47.000,00:56:48.720,And I wish you all the best of luck.
00:56:48.760,00:56:50.160,Thank you.
00:56:50.800,00:56:52.640,Peeta Mellark.
00:56:53.200,00:56:55.240,District 12!
00:56:58.080,00:56:59.720,What the hell was that?
00:56:59.760,00:57:01.680,"You don't talk to me, and then you say you have a crush on me?"
00:57:01.720,00:57:03.760,You say you want to train alone?
00:57:03.800,00:57:05.440,HAYMITCH: Stop it! Stop it!
00:57:05.480,00:57:07.320,KATNISS: Let's start right now!
00:57:08.440,00:57:09.440,He did you a favor.
00:57:09.480,00:57:11.160,He made me look weak.
00:57:11.200,00:57:14.360,"He made you look desirable, which in your case, can't hurt, sweetheart."
00:57:14.400,00:57:15.400,"He's right, Katniss."
00:57:15.440,00:57:16.880,Of course I'm right.
00:57:16.920,00:57:20.040,"Now, I can sell the star-crossed lovers from District 12..."
00:57:20.080,00:57:21.560,We are not star-crossed lovers.
00:57:21.600,00:57:23.440,It's a television show!
00:57:23.480,00:57:29.840,"And being in love with that boy might just get you sponsors, which could save your damn life."
00:57:30.320,00:57:33.720,get out of here?
00:57:33.760,00:57:36.680,Maybe I can deliver you both in one piece tomorrow.
00:57:36.720,00:57:38.400,Manners!
00:58:07.840,00:58:09.400,"You, too?"
00:58:11.120,00:58:12.480,Hey.
00:58:12.520,00:58:13.680,Can't sleep?
00:58:13.720,00:58:15.800,No. Of course not.
00:58:17.840,00:58:20.360,I'm sorry I went after you.
00:58:22.360,00:58:25.080,"You know, I meant that as a compliment."
00:58:25.120,00:58:26.560,I know.
00:58:37.120,00:58:39.000,Listen to them.
00:58:40.400,00:58:41.800,Yeah.
00:58:45.680,00:58:48.720,I just don't want them to change me.
00:58:50.920,00:58:52.960,How would they change you?
00:58:55.760,00:59:00.720,I don't know.
00:59:00.760,00:59:04.880,"I just don't want to be another piece in their game, you know?"
00:59:06.000,00:59:07.760,You mean you won't kill anyone?
00:59:09.640,00:59:11.240,No.
00:59:11.280,00:59:22.440,"I mean, I'm sure I would, just like anybody else when the time came, but I just keep wishing that I could think of a way to show them that they don't own me."
00:59:25.240,00:59:30.520,"If I'm gonna die, I want to still be me."
00:59:34.960,00:59:36.720,Does that make any sense?
00:59:36.760,00:59:38.120,Yeah.
00:59:40.000,00:59:42.640,I just can't afford to think like that.
00:59:46.480,00:59:48.440,I have my sister.
00:59:50.000,00:59:51.800,"Yeah, I know."
01:00:05.640,01:00:08.320,I guess I'll see you tomorrow.
01:00:10.480,01:00:12.440,See you tomorrow.
01:00:36.080,01:00:40.960,"They'll put all kinds of stuff right in front, right in the mouth of the Cornucopia."
01:00:41.000,01:00:43.680,There'll even be a bow there.
01:00:43.720,01:00:45.200,Why not?
01:00:45.240,01:00:47.160,It's a bloodbath.
01:00:47.200,01:00:48.680,That's not your game.
01:00:48.720,01:00:52.440,"You turn, run, find high ground, look for water."
01:00:52.480,01:00:55.120,Water's your new best friend.
01:00:55.160,01:00:59.280,Don't step off that pedestal early or they'll blow you sky high.
01:00:59.320,01:01:00.800,I won't.
01:01:12.080,01:01:15.800,"Katniss, you can do this."
01:01:22.840,01:01:24.280,Thanks.
01:01:28.680,01:01:30.640,WOMAN: Give me your arm.
01:01:34.280,01:01:35.800,Give me your arm.
01:01:41.760,01:01:43.920,Give me your arm.
01:01:46.200,01:01:47.920,Your tracker.
01:01:49.040,01:01:50.280,GAMEKEEPER: We're up.
01:01:50.320,01:01:51.840,We're up!
01:01:53.560,01:01:57.680,"All right. Less than a minute, people."
01:01:57.720,01:02:00.520,There are 15 out.
01:02:36.000,01:02:37.520,Here.
01:02:55.560,01:02:56.640,Shh.
01:02:56.680,01:02:58.280,Thank you.
01:03:06.240,01:03:08.040,ELECTRONIC VOICE: Thirty seconds.
01:03:14.840,01:03:19.600,"I'm not allowed to bet, but if I could, I'd bet on you."
01:03:29.840,01:03:31.800,Twenty seconds.
01:03:43.320,01:03:45.440,Ten seconds.
01:04:09.760,01:04:12.520,"Okay, they're in the tubes."
01:04:50.640,01:05:21.400,"GAMEKEEPER: 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22..."
01:08:22.880,01:08:29.680,"And, of course, there's the familiar boom of the cannon, which marks the end of another fallen Tribute."

01:10:19.320,01:10:20.520,WOMAN: Twenty-five? Got it.
01:10:24.800,01:10:26.000,He's moving now.
01:11:53.800,01:11:57.800,"Well, that makes 13 gone in the first eight hours."
01:11:57.840,01:12:01.800,"And Claudius, I think I see an alliance forming."
01:12:06.320,01:12:07.920,MARVEL: Wait! Did you see the look on her face?
01:12:07.960,01:12:09.840,How stupid can you get?
01:12:09.880,01:12:13.200,"GLIMMER: Oh, no!"
01:12:13.240,01:12:15.840,That's actually a good impression.
01:12:15.880,01:12:17.240,"Hey, lover boy!"
01:12:18.400,01:12:19.640,You sure she went this way?
01:12:19.680,01:12:20.960,"Yeah, I'm sure."
01:12:21.680,01:12:22.960,CATO: You better be.
01:12:23.000,01:12:26.520,"Yeah, that was her snare we found back there."
01:12:31.280,01:12:33.520,GLIMMER: Are you sure we shouldn't just kill him now?
01:12:33.560,01:12:35.680,Nah. He's our best chance of finding her.
01:12:35.720,01:12:37.280,Let's go.
01:12:56.920,01:12:58.320,Sir?
01:13:00.040,01:13:02.280,She is almost at the edge.
01:13:02.320,01:13:04.760,Two kilometers away from the nearest Tribute.
01:13:04.800,01:13:06.400,SENECA: Let's turn her around.
01:14:04.360,01:14:08.000,Cueing another.
01:14:18.680,01:14:20.720,She's heading towards the left flank.
01:14:20.760,01:14:23.000,Okay. Can you give me a tree right there?
01:14:23.040,01:14:26.240,Sure. Cueing tree.
01:15:15.120,01:15:17.200,She's almost there.
01:15:29.760,01:15:32.560,"Lucia, get a cannon ready."
01:15:43.520,01:15:45.320,There she is!
01:15:47.600,01:15:48.600,She's mine!
01:15:48.640,01:15:50.400,CATO: Not if I get her first!
01:15:54.360,01:15:56.440,Where you gonna go?
01:15:56.480,01:15:59.520,Fish out of the pond!
01:16:05.080,01:16:07.440,There she is!
01:16:11.800,01:16:13.520,CATO: Here we go!
01:16:18.760,01:16:21.240,"Where you going, huh?"
01:16:21.280,01:16:23.000,CATO: Where do you think you're going?
01:16:25.600,01:16:27.840,"Where you going, baby?"
01:16:28.600,01:16:30.040,Three o'clock.
01:16:32.240,01:16:34.280,"Where you going, Girl on Fire?"
01:16:34.320,01:16:35.840,"Miss Everdeen, I'm gonna get you!"
01:16:35.880,01:16:37.200,"That's not gonna help you up there, Katniss."
01:16:37.240,01:16:39.120,CLOVE: Where are you going?
01:16:39.160,01:16:41.640,"MARVEL: Go get her, man!"
01:16:41.680,01:16:43.640,"Just get her, Cato!"
01:16:43.680,01:16:45.640,"GLIMMER: He's gonna get you, Katniss."
01:16:45.680,01:16:47.360,CLOVE: Right up there.
01:16:47.400,01:16:50.080,GLIMMER: Kill her!
01:16:50.120,01:16:51.840,"CLOVE: Go, Cato."
01:16:51.880,01:16:52.880,CLOVE: She's right there.
01:16:52.920,01:16:53.920,You got this.
01:16:53.960,01:16:55.080,Go! He's got this.
01:16:55.120,01:16:57.440,"Kill her, Cato!"
01:16:57.480,01:16:59.440,GLIMMER: Take her down!
01:16:59.480,01:17:00.840,"CLOVE: You got this, Cato!"
01:17:00.880,01:17:02.280,I'm coming for you!
01:17:02.320,01:17:04.080,"CLOVE: Come on, Cato!"
01:17:07.760,01:17:09.760,GLIMMER: I'll do it myself.
01:17:16.200,01:17:17.680,Give me that before...
01:17:17.720,01:17:20.160,Get her.
01:17:22.320,01:17:25.000,Maybe you should throw the sword!
01:17:25.040,01:17:26.640,PEETA: Let's just wait her out.
01:17:29.320,01:17:32.840,She's gotta come down at some point.
01:17:32.880,01:17:34.320,We'll just kill her then.
01:17:38.080,01:17:39.440,Okay.
01:17:40.120,01:17:41.960,Somebody make a fire.
01:17:52.320,01:17:53.800,GLIMMER: Let's make camp over here!
01:17:53.840,01:17:55.880,MARVEL: Hurry up with the fire.
01:18:51.280,01:18:52.760,Boys.
01:20:26.320,01:20:27.960,Thank you.
01:21:08.240,01:21:09.440,Psst.
01:21:11.040,01:21:12.240,Psst.
01:21:34.960,01:21:36.920,"Claudius, I think those are tracker jackers."
01:21:36.960,01:21:38.240,Am I wrong?
01:21:38.280,01:21:39.480,Oh.
01:21:40.800,01:21:43.520,Those things are very lethal.
01:21:43.560,01:21:56.360,"For those of you who don't know, tracker jackers are genetically engineered wasps whose venom causes searing pain, powerful hallucinations, and in extreme cases, death."
01:24:46.680,01:24:47.960,PEETA: Run.
01:24:48.680,01:24:50.040,Run!
01:24:50.960,01:24:52.360,Run!
01:24:53.080,01:24:55.160,"Katniss, go!"
01:24:55.200,01:24:58.520,Get out of here! Go!
01:25:09.120,01:25:16.760,"Not only is it lethal, but the venom of a tracker jacker sting can produce powerful hallucinations."
01:26:14.320,01:26:18.960,"Mom, don't just sit there and look at me!"
01:26:19.000,01:26:21.080,"PEETA'S VOICE: Katniss, go!"
01:26:22.080,01:26:25.360,Get out of here! Go!
01:27:23.160,01:27:24.440,Rue?
01:27:27.720,01:27:30.640,It's okay.
01:27:47.000,01:27:48.760,"You want mine, too?"
01:27:49.440,01:27:51.400,"No, that's okay."
01:27:52.040,01:27:53.360,Here.
01:27:54.000,01:27:55.400,Thanks.
01:27:59.920,01:28:02.240,How long was I asleep?
01:28:02.280,01:28:06.120,Couple of days.
01:28:07.400,01:28:09.000,Thank you.
01:28:10.360,01:28:13.160,So what happened while I was out?
01:28:13.200,01:28:16.480,The girl from 1 and the boy from 10.
01:28:19.680,01:28:22.680,And the boy from my district?
01:28:22.720,01:28:26.560,"Yeah, he's okay."
01:28:29.040,01:28:30.720,Is all of that true?
01:28:30.760,01:28:32.080,What?
01:28:32.520,01:28:34.120,You and him?
01:28:35.320,01:28:37.280,So where are Cato and the others?
01:28:37.320,01:28:40.160,They got all their supplies down by the lake.
01:28:40.200,01:28:42.920,It's piled up in this great big pyramid.
01:28:42.960,01:28:45.120,That sounds tempting.
01:28:59.920,01:29:04.600,"Now, this green stuff is gonna smoke like crazy, so as soon as you light it, move on to the next fire."
01:29:04.640,01:29:07.120,"Light this one last, and I'll meet you back over there."
01:29:07.160,01:29:08.600,Right.
01:29:11.480,01:29:14.440,And then I'll destroy their stuff while they're chasing us.
01:29:14.480,01:29:16.680,We need a signal in case one of us gets held up.
01:29:16.720,01:29:18.120,Okay. Like what?
01:29:20.040,01:29:22.080,Here. Watch this.
01:29:27.120,01:29:29.920,Mockingjays. That's great.
01:29:29.960,01:29:33.480,"Back home, we use them to signal all the time."
01:29:37.480,01:29:38.960,You try.
01:29:47.760,01:29:52.880,"Okay, so if we hear that, it means we're okay and we'll be back real soon."
01:29:52.920,01:29:54.400,We're gonna be okay.
01:29:59.800,01:30:03.360,"Hey, I'll see you for supper."
01:30:04.080,01:30:06.440,Okay.
01:30:33.160,01:30:37.240,"Guys. Guys, look! Over here."
01:30:40.400,01:30:41.720,Let's go.
01:30:41.760,01:30:45.080,You stay guard and don't move until we can get back.
01:31:11.960,01:31:15.240,I want to see if she's gonna figure out this booby trap.
01:31:15.280,01:31:20.680,Yes. It seems they've reburied their mines around that big pile of goodies.
01:31:31.760,01:31:35.280,"CAESAR: She's certainly figured it out, hasn't she?"
01:33:37.160,01:33:39.240,GUARD: I don't know what happened.
01:33:39.280,01:33:42.280,What the hell happened?
01:33:42.320,01:33:43.560,Our stuff!
01:34:37.800,01:34:39.280,RUE: Katniss!
01:34:40.640,01:34:42.520,Katniss!
01:34:43.680,01:34:45.760,"Katniss, help!"
01:34:46.520,01:34:48.200,Katniss!
01:34:52.280,01:34:55.120,Katniss! Help!
01:34:55.640,01:34:57.200,Katniss!
01:34:57.960,01:34:59.440,Katniss!
01:34:59.480,01:35:01.400,It's okay. It's okay.
01:35:09.840,01:35:13.920,You're okay. You're okay.
01:35:40.960,01:35:43.360,It's okay. You're okay.
01:35:43.400,01:35:46.520,You're okay. You're okay.
01:35:53.160,01:35:55.560,Did you blow up the food?
01:35:57.600,01:35:59.480,Every bit of it.
01:36:02.280,01:36:03.720,Good.
01:36:05.360,01:36:07.600,You have to win.
01:36:16.080,01:36:18.040,Can you sing?
01:36:21.400,01:36:22.720,Okay.
01:37:45.120,01:37:46.320,I'm sorry.
01:37:48.200,01:37:50.040,I'm sorry.
01:40:38.600,01:40:41.040,HAYMITCH: Don't kill her.
01:40:41.080,01:40:42.400,"SENECA: Well, it seems we've already got one."
01:40:42.440,01:40:44.320,I hear these rumors out of District 11.
01:40:44.360,01:40:45.640,This could get away from you.
01:40:45.680,01:40:47.600,What do you want?
01:40:47.640,01:40:49.200,You have a lot of anger out there.
01:40:49.240,01:40:52.200,I know you know how to handle a mob.
01:40:52.240,01:40:57.840,"If you can't scare them, give them something to root for."
01:40:57.880,01:40:59.080,Such as?
01:41:01.680,01:41:03.680,Young love.
01:41:04.640,01:41:06.720,So you like an underdog?
01:41:06.760,01:41:08.040,Everyone likes an underdog.
01:41:08.080,01:41:09.560,I don't.
01:41:10.920,01:41:14.600,Have you been out there? 10? 11? 12?
01:41:15.440,01:41:17.240,Not personally. No.
01:41:17.280,01:41:19.000,"Well, I have."
01:41:19.760,01:41:21.680,There are lots of underdogs.
01:41:21.720,01:41:23.600,"Lots of coal, too."
01:41:23.640,01:41:27.640,"Grow crops, minerals, things we need."
01:41:28.600,01:41:31.640,There are lots of underdogs.
01:41:31.680,01:41:37.960,"And I think if you could see them, you would not root for them either."
01:41:39.680,01:41:41.320,I like you.
01:41:44.240,01:41:46.120,Be careful.
01:41:55.960,01:41:58.160,"CLAUDIUS: Attention, Tributes. Attention."
01:41:58.200,01:42:02.880,The regulations requiring a single victor have been suspended.
01:42:02.920,01:42:08.800,"From now on, two victors may be crowned, if both originate from the same district."
01:42:08.840,01:42:11.800,This will be the only announcement.
01:42:12.560,01:42:14.080,Peeta.
01:43:12.200,01:43:15.200,"Oh, my God! Peeta! Peeta!"
01:43:17.560,01:43:18.760,Hi.
01:43:22.160,01:43:23.920,It's okay.
01:43:37.960,01:43:39.560,What was it?
01:43:39.600,01:43:41.120,A sword.
01:43:42.400,01:43:44.320,"It's bad, huh?"
01:43:44.960,01:43:47.040,It's gonna be fine.
01:43:55.520,01:43:56.720,Ah!
01:43:58.760,01:44:00.520,Katniss.
01:44:03.680,01:44:06.320,Katniss.
01:44:06.360,01:44:10.920,I'm not gonna leave you.
01:44:17.320,01:44:19.040,Why not?
01:44:38.000,01:44:40.520,Nobody's gonna find you in here.
01:44:40.560,01:44:42.920,They already found me.
01:44:46.400,01:44:48.280,We'll just get you some medicine.
01:44:48.320,01:44:50.520,"Katniss, I don't get many parachutes."
01:44:51.000,01:44:52.480,We'll figure something out.
01:44:53.240,01:44:54.840,Like what?
01:44:55.520,01:44:57.160,Something.
01:45:55.640,01:45:58.680,Medicine?
01:45:58.920,01:46:00.120,I'll do it.
01:46:10.120,01:46:11.880,That's nice.
01:46:13.480,01:46:15.640,You fed me once.
01:46:18.160,01:46:20.480,I think about that all the time.
01:46:21.720,01:46:23.600,How I tossed you that bread.
01:46:23.640,01:46:25.320,Peeta...
01:46:25.360,01:46:27.360,I should have just gone out in the rain and...
01:46:30.480,01:46:32.240,You feel hot.
01:46:34.400,01:46:36.880,I remember the first time I saw you.
01:46:37.560,01:46:39.880,Your hair was in two braids instead of one.
01:46:40.880,01:46:43.800,And I remember when you sang in the music assembly.
01:46:43.840,01:46:46.160,"The teacher said, Who knows The Valley Song?"
01:46:46.200,01:46:48.280,And your hand shot straight up.
01:46:48.320,01:46:49.800,Stop.
01:46:49.840,01:46:54.160,"After that, I watched you going home every day."
01:46:56.240,01:46:57.840,Every day.
01:47:05.000,01:47:07.160,"Well, say something."
01:47:09.720,01:47:12.600,I'm not good at saying something.
01:47:13.880,01:47:15.520,Then come here.
01:47:16.800,01:47:18.280,Please.
01:47:29.720,01:47:31.960,Even if I don't make it...
01:47:32.360,01:47:33.680,Stop it.
01:47:39.440,01:47:42.080,"CLAUDIUS: Attention, Tributes, attention."
01:47:42.120,01:47:46.600,"Commencing at sunrise, there will be a feast tomorrow at the Cornucopia."
01:47:46.640,01:47:49.600,This will be no ordinary occasion.
01:47:49.640,01:47:53.280,Each of you needs something desperately.
01:47:53.320,01:47:57.160,And we plan to be generous hosts.
01:47:57.200,01:47:58.720,Your medicine.
01:47:58.760,01:47:59.840,You're not going alone.
01:47:59.880,01:48:01.960,"Yeah? You need it, and you can't walk."
01:48:02.000,01:48:04.680,"Katniss, you're not gonna risk your life for me."
01:48:04.720,01:48:08.320,You would do it for me.
01:48:09.440,01:48:11.520,Why are you doing this?
01:48:28.840,01:48:31.000,Now there's no way I'm letting you go.
01:48:31.040,01:48:32.080,Peeta...
01:48:32.120,01:48:33.560,Please.
01:48:34.160,01:48:35.440,Stay.
01:48:40.120,01:48:41.480,Okay.
01:48:42.600,01:48:44.200,I'll stay.
01:50:09.320,01:50:10.880,"Oh, God!"
01:50:40.680,01:50:42.720,Where's lover boy?
01:50:44.840,01:50:49.080,"Oh, I see."
01:50:49.120,01:50:51.080,"Well, that's sweet."
01:50:51.120,01:50:54.040,"You know, it's too bad that you couldn't help your little friend."
01:50:54.080,01:50:56.880,That little girl?
01:50:57.160,01:50:58.440,Rue?
01:51:00.720,01:51:03.320,"Yeah, well, we killed her."
01:51:03.360,01:51:07.000,And now we're gonna kill you.
01:51:12.040,01:51:13.320,You kill her?
01:51:13.360,01:51:14.520,No!
01:51:14.560,01:51:16.440,Cato! Cato!
01:51:16.480,01:51:18.000,You said her name!
01:51:28.040,01:51:29.440,"Just this time, 12."
01:51:30.280,01:51:31.520,For Rue.
01:51:46.920,01:51:50.320,"Peeta, I got it."
01:51:50.360,01:51:51.800,What happened to you?
01:51:51.840,01:51:53.360,"No, you're not."
01:51:53.400,01:51:55.640,"The girl from 2, she threw a knife. I'm okay."
01:51:55.680,01:51:57.440,You shouldn't have gone.
01:51:57.480,01:51:59.280,You got worse.
01:52:02.920,01:52:04.120,I'm sorry.
01:52:05.360,01:52:07.080,"You need some of that, too."
01:52:07.120,01:52:08.640,I'm okay.
01:52:11.240,01:52:13.240,That feels better.
01:52:14.360,01:52:16.680,Okay. Now you.
01:52:16.720,01:52:19.280,I'm okay.
01:52:19.320,01:52:20.680,Come on.
01:52:20.720,01:52:22.240,All right.
01:53:19.000,01:53:20.240,Hi.
01:53:21.440,01:53:24.600,Oh. You're so much better.
01:53:26.640,01:53:28.240,"Oh, my God, Peeta."
01:53:29.000,01:53:31.120,PEETA: I hardly feel anything.
01:53:31.880,01:53:34.320,We could go home.
01:53:34.360,01:53:37.320,We could.
01:53:37.360,01:53:39.320,We could go home.
01:53:43.520,01:53:45.160,PEETA: We know Thresh took off.
01:53:45.200,01:53:46.960,Cato's gonna be by the Cornucopia.
01:53:47.000,01:53:49.000,He's not gonna go someplace he doesn't know.
01:53:49.040,01:53:51.920,"Foxface, she could be anywhere."
01:53:54.000,01:53:57.080,We should probably hunt around here.
01:53:57.120,01:53:59.080,"Okay, I'll take the bow."
01:54:00.680,01:54:03.640,I'm just kidding.
01:54:20.560,01:54:21.960,Peeta?
01:54:26.040,01:54:27.400,Peeta?
01:54:30.080,01:54:31.480,Peeta!
01:54:32.360,01:54:33.360,Peeta!
01:54:33.400,01:54:34.520,Are you okay?
01:54:34.560,01:54:36.320,I heard the cannon.
01:54:36.360,01:54:39.480,"That's Nightlock, Peeta!"
01:54:39.520,01:54:40.640,I didn't know.
01:54:40.680,01:54:43.480,You scared me to death. Damn you.
01:54:43.720,01:54:45.320,I'm sorry.
01:54:46.360,01:54:48.000,I'm sorry.
01:54:55.440,01:54:57.560,PEETA: I never even knew she was following me.
01:54:57.600,01:54:59.240,KATNISS: She's clever.
01:54:59.280,01:55:00.920,Too clever.
01:55:01.880,01:55:03.240,What are you doing?
01:55:03.280,01:55:05.360,"Maybe Cato likes berries, too."
01:55:10.760,01:55:12.240,What time is it?
01:55:12.280,01:55:13.680,A little after noon.
01:55:13.720,01:55:14.880,Why is it getting so dark?
01:55:14.920,01:55:16.840,Must be in a hurry to end it.
01:55:19.600,01:55:20.640,"You ready, Lucia?"
01:55:20.680,01:55:22.520,"Right here, sir."
01:55:23.480,01:55:25.560,"Well, that's great."
01:55:25.600,01:55:26.600,Now can you put that in the middle?
01:55:26.640,01:55:27.880,Sure.
01:55:35.760,01:55:40.000,That's it.
01:55:50.320,01:55:52.320,Did you hear that?
01:56:22.960,01:56:24.480,What was that?
01:56:25.200,01:56:27.200,It's the finale.
01:56:41.600,01:56:42.840,Let's go.
01:57:48.840,01:57:50.040,Go.
01:58:06.320,01:58:07.520,Katniss!
01:58:31.720,01:58:33.200,Here!
01:59:42.720,01:59:45.720,Go on. Shoot.
01:59:47.480,01:59:50.160,Then we both go down and you'd win.
01:59:52.800,01:59:58.080,Go on.
02:00:01.840,02:00:03.960,"I always was, right?"
02:00:05.840,02:00:08.280,I didn't know that till now.
02:00:10.960,02:00:13.760,How is that?
02:00:15.240,02:00:17.680,No.
02:00:18.840,02:00:20.520,I could still do this.
02:00:21.640,02:00:23.880,I could still do this.
02:00:24.360,02:00:26.600,One more kill.
02:00:28.280,02:00:31.000,It's the only thing I know how to do.
02:00:31.040,02:00:33.680,Bring pride to my district.
02:00:36.680,02:00:38.840,Not that it matters.
02:00:54.240,02:00:55.600,Please!
02:00:57.000,02:00:58.200,No!
02:01:04.480,02:01:05.680,Please!
02:01:51.040,02:01:53.600,CLAUDIUS: Attention.
02:01:53.640,02:01:56.960,There has been a slight rule change.
02:01:57.000,02:02:04.520,"The previous revision, allowing for two victors from the same district, has been revoked."
02:02:05.160,02:02:08.240,Only one victor may be crowned.
02:02:08.280,02:02:10.200,Good luck.
02:02:10.240,02:02:13.800,And may the odds be ever in your favor.
02:02:27.280,02:02:28.800,Go ahead.
02:02:32.400,02:02:34.960,One of us should go home.
02:02:35.000,02:02:38.760,One of us has to die.
02:02:38.800,02:02:40.080,No.
02:02:41.000,02:02:42.680,They don't.
02:02:44.120,02:02:45.560,Why should they?
02:02:46.360,02:02:48.400,No!
02:02:48.960,02:02:50.480,Trust me.
02:03:08.280,02:03:10.000,Together?
02:03:11.120,02:03:12.640,Together.
02:03:13.520,02:03:14.800,Okay.
02:03:15.600,02:03:17.000,One...
02:03:18.880,02:03:20.400,Two...
02:03:25.920,02:03:27.360,Three.
02:03:28.680,02:03:30.160,CLAUDIUS: Stop!
02:03:30.640,02:03:32.160,Stop!
02:03:35.160,02:03:42.760,"Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the winners of the 74th Annual Hunger Games."
02:04:08.080,02:04:10.560,HAYMITCH: They're not happy with you.
02:04:10.600,02:04:12.920,KATNISS: Why?
02:04:12.960,02:04:15.480,Because you showed them up.
02:04:15.520,02:04:18.240,"Well, I'm sorry it didn't go the way they planned."
02:04:18.280,02:04:19.600,I'm not very happy with them either.
02:04:19.640,02:04:20.960,Katniss!
02:04:21.000,02:04:24.360,This is serious.
02:04:24.400,02:04:26.960,They don't take these things lightly.
02:05:16.200,02:05:18.440,"When they ask, you say you couldn't help yourself."
02:05:18.480,02:05:24.920,You were so in love with this boy that the thought of not being with him was unthinkable.
02:05:24.960,02:05:29.440,You'd rather die than not be with him.
02:05:29.480,02:05:34.840,How did you feel when you found him by that river?
02:05:38.240,02:05:40.960,I felt like the happiest person in the world.
02:05:44.360,02:05:47.080,I couldn't imagine life without him.
02:05:47.120,02:05:48.320,Oh.
02:05:53.200,02:05:55.160,"And what about you, Peeta?"
02:05:55.800,02:05:57.480,She saved my life.
02:05:57.520,02:05:58.800,We saved each other.
02:06:00.360,02:06:10.080,"Ladies and gentlemen, the star-crossed lovers from District 12, this year's victors of the 74th Annual Hunger Games!"
02:06:25.960,02:06:27.440,PRESIDENT SNOW: Congratulations.
02:06:27.480,02:06:29.120,Thank you.
02:06:34.360,02:06:35.760,What a lovely pin.
02:06:35.800,02:06:38.760,Thank you.
02:06:38.800,02:06:41.600,They must be very proud of you.
02:06:53.320,02:06:56.200,So what happens when we get back?
02:06:56.960,02:07:01.640,I don't know.
02:07:05.360,02:07:07.640,I don't want to forget.
