00:00:35.118,00:00:37.370,Our first form of communication.
00:00:38.413,00:00:43.793,"Safety, security, comfort, all in the gentle caress of a finger."
00:00:44.294,00:00:46.713,Or the brush of lips on a soft cheek.
00:00:47.464,00:00:49.674,It connects us when we're happy.
00:00:51.217,00:01:02.562,It bolsters us in times of fear… excites us in times of passion… and love.
00:01:03.688,00:01:08.860,"We need that touch from the one we love, almost as much as we need her to breathe."
00:01:10.028,00:01:13.573,But I never understood the importance of touch.
00:01:14.783,00:01:16.159,His touch.
00:01:19.287,00:01:21.831,Until I couldn't have it.
00:01:44.395,00:01:46.523,"-Oh, yeah. -Oh."
00:01:46.606,00:01:48.399,"Oh, yeah, This one's perfect."
00:01:49.484,00:01:52.320,"Actually, though, the tan lines might be incredible."
00:01:52.403,00:01:54.739,"Oh, my gosh, That doesn't even cover half your boobs."
00:01:55.865,00:02:01.496,No. You need something… -This is actually cute. -Ooh. That's actually really cute.
00:02:01.579,00:02:02.497,-Yeah. -Lemme see.
00:02:03.373,00:02:05.041,-Yeah. -Really? It's actually really pretty.
00:02:05.125,00:02:08.670,"I can't tell if you're, like, too trampy, or not trampy enough."
00:02:08.753,00:02:10.797,Hello?
00:02:10.880,00:02:13.508,"-Are you with us? -Okay, guess what?"
00:02:13.591,00:02:16.594,Taylor and Mason are meeting us at the airport in the morning.
00:02:17.178,00:02:18.388,What's that face?
00:02:18.471,00:02:19.889,"-Oh, my god. -What?"
00:02:21.516,00:02:23.351,Mason and Brooke broke up.
00:02:23.852,00:02:24.811,"-No, they didn't. -Yes."
00:02:24.894,00:02:26.521,"-They did. -Oh, my god. Come on!"
00:02:26.604,00:02:28.273,Maya. You're gonna do it!
00:02:30.316,00:02:32.193,I wish I could be there to see that in person.
00:02:34.529,00:02:37.657,Just sucks that you planned it this year and you don't even get to go.
00:02:38.992,00:02:44.581,Well… you can just Photoshop me in with your fancy editing apps.
00:02:44.664,00:02:45.540,What're you talking about?
00:02:45.623,00:02:46.666,-You're not laughing. -You know what I'm talking about.
00:02:46.749,00:02:47.625,No I don't.
00:02:47.709,00:02:49.961,The one where you get your pimples and your little… -What? -Mm-hmm.
00:02:50.044,00:02:51.838,-…your little fake blush. -Shut up.
00:02:51.921,00:02:53.423,"The lashes… Your lashes aren't that ling, really."
00:02:53.506,00:02:55.174,-This is so annoying. -Okay. Come on.
00:02:55.258,00:02:56.676,Thank you for the burgers.
00:02:58.052,00:03:00.638,"Honestly, you guys are gonna have so much fun."
00:03:00.722,00:03:01.764,-Okay? -Okay.
00:03:01.848,00:03:02.974,I… I love you.
00:03:03.057,00:03:04.058,I love you more.
00:03:04.142,00:03:05.226,I love you.
00:03:05.310,00:03:07.061,-I'll miss you. -I… mwah!
00:03:07.145,00:03:08.521,-Hey. -Use protection.
00:03:58.780,00:04:02.033,"I'm back in the hospital, again, for another tune-up."
00:04:02.116,00:04:08.748,"Need a few more rounds of antibiotics to get over this little sore throat that I've been… Hi, Barbs!"
00:04:08.831,00:04:12.627,Sore throat? Right. With a 102 fever.
00:04:12.710,00:04:13.836,I've had worse. Say hi!
00:04:13.920,00:04:15.546,"Stella, get that thing out of my face."
00:04:15.630,00:04:17.257,-You're looking good. -I know that.
00:04:17.340,00:04:20.218,"Well, Stella will be right back after we get her al set up."
00:04:20.301,00:04:21.886,You heard the boss lady.
00:04:24.597,00:04:26.391,I think this is her best work.
00:04:28.017,00:04:29.477,"Hi, Stella."
00:04:29.560,00:04:33.898,"Wow. Wow, a lot's changed in the last six months."
00:04:33.982,00:04:35.275,Yup.
00:04:35.358,00:04:36.192,He's due in March.
00:04:36.276,00:04:37.735,"And your arm, please."
00:04:37.819,00:04:39.779,-What room is Paul in? -310.
00:04:41.739,00:04:44.492,And… open up.
00:04:53.209,00:04:55.628,You are all set. I'll see you in a bit.
00:04:55.712,00:04:57.046,"Thank you, Julie."
00:05:00.967,00:05:02.260,Are you sure this is okay?
00:05:02.343,00:05:06.556,"I will still be monitoring you. And, yes… it's okay."
00:05:06.639,00:05:08.099,What would I do without you?
00:05:11.728,00:05:12.854,That's true!
00:05:12.937,00:05:17.025,"So, Barb is letting me keep my med cart in my room this time."
00:05:17.108,00:05:19.027,She left me a bunch of pills.
00:05:19.110,00:05:22.322,Some… some G-juice. Yum.
00:05:22.405,00:05:26.284,That's the liquid nutrition that goes straight to my stomach through my G-tube.
00:05:28.911,00:05:34.334,"wishing you could eat 5,000 calories a day and not gain a pound, I'll trade you any day."
00:05:35.418,00:05:39.338,"Today, I'll probably be re-organizing this thing."
00:05:39.422,00:05:43.009,"Because as many of you know, I'm slightly anal."
00:05:43.092,00:05:45.344,"By slightly anal, I mean clinically OCD."
00:05:46.554,00:05:49.932,"So, peace. Bye, guys."
00:07:28.865,00:07:30.533,New baby upstairs.
00:07:30.616,00:07:32.243,Meet me in 15.
00:07:36.497,00:07:37.915,"Hi, Cynthia."
00:07:37.999,00:07:39.959,"Hi, Stella."
00:07:41.169,00:07:42.128,Hi.
00:07:58.019,00:08:00.855,"so unless you plant your ass on that call button, no one's gonna bother you for, like, an hour."
00:08:00.938,00:08:03.441,"Hey. I gotta sleep on that bed, okay?"
00:08:04.108,00:08:06.068,"Wow. I mean, we're not animals."
00:08:06.152,00:08:07.904,"Don't worry, it's not even gonna take that long."
00:09:09.257,00:09:11.467,Saw you moving in your stuff.
00:09:12.051,00:09:14.720,"There was, uh, a lot of it."
00:09:15.471,00:09:17.056,You gonna be here for a while?
00:09:19.475,00:09:20.977,Hello?
00:09:23.771,00:09:25.189,Oh.
00:09:25.273,00:09:27.483,You're deaf.
00:09:28.484,00:09:32.238,Shouldn't you be procuring your room for your guests?
00:09:32.321,00:09:34.282,You rent by the hour or what?
00:09:34.365,00:09:36.826,So that was you lurking in the hall.
00:09:36.909,00:09:39.495,"Mm, I don't lurk and you followed me here."
00:09:39.579,00:09:44.750,"I wanted to introduce myself, but… -that little attitude of yours… -Let me guess."
00:09:44.834,00:09:49.088,You're the kind of guy that ignores the rules 'cause it makes you feel in control. Am I right?
00:09:49.171,00:09:50.715,You're not wrong.
00:09:50.798,00:09:51.882,You think that's cute?
00:09:51.966,00:09:53.843,Do you think it's cute?
00:09:54.885,00:09:58.764,"Letting your friends borrow your room for sex is disgusting, so no."
00:09:58.848,00:09:59.849,You don't like sex?
00:09:59.932,00:10:02.977,"No, I like… sex."
00:10:03.060,00:10:04.437,I like sex.
00:10:05.730,00:10:06.606,Sex is fine.
00:10:06.689,00:10:07.857,Hm.
00:10:07.940,00:10:11.694,"Fine isn't exactly a ringing endorsement, but I'll take some common ground where I can get it."
00:10:11.777,00:10:14.196,"-We have nothing in common. -Oh, that's cold."
00:10:18.034,00:10:21.454,Six feet at all times. You both know the rules.
00:10:21.537,00:10:23.789,"Will, get back to your room."
00:10:23.873,00:10:25.207,There you go.
00:10:25.291,00:10:28.085,A little name for your psychological profile.
00:10:29.170,00:10:30.546,I'm Will Newman.
00:10:31.922,00:10:33.549,Deaf.
00:10:36.177,00:10:37.386,Stella.
00:10:38.512,00:10:40.181,You need to lighten up.
00:10:40.848,00:10:42.016,It's just life.
00:10:42.683,00:10:44.393,It'll be over before you know it.
00:10:51.776,00:10:53.069,"So, he's a CFer?"
00:10:53.903,00:10:55.446,B. Cepacia.
00:10:56.947,00:10:59.825,Part of a new drug trial for Cevaflomalin.
00:11:01.118,00:11:07.124,You contract that and you can… you can kiss the possibility of new lungs goodbye.
00:11:08.584,00:11:11.045,There's no coming back from that bacteria.
00:11:12.004,00:11:13.464,Stay away.
00:11:39.115,00:11:40.783,"Hello, world."
00:11:40.866,00:11:44.245,"Okay, AffloVest for thirty more minutes, then you're all set."
00:11:44.328,00:11:46.372,You need anything else before I hit the road?
00:11:46.455,00:11:48.624,Chocolate puddling. Or two.
00:11:48.707,00:11:50.501,"Oh, so what, I'm room service now?"
00:12:00.636,00:12:02.972,Good girl. Good girl.
00:12:03.055,00:12:04.890,"All right, Good. Right?"
00:12:07.435,00:12:08.769,See you tomorrow.
00:12:08.853,00:12:10.521,"-Bye, Barb. -Okay."
00:12:23.492,00:12:30.082,"which doesn't necessarily mean I'm gonna die tomorrow, but I could die tomorrow. Anyone could die tomorrow."
00:12:30.166,00:12:32.585,I just have a little bit less time than everyone else.
00:12:32.668,00:12:37.256,My lungs are at about fifty percent function right now.
00:12:37.339,00:12:43.345,"So at this rate, Doctor Hamid says that I'll need a transplant by the time I'm a junior in high school."
00:12:49.101,00:12:52.563,We're at the NICU because I'm obsessed with babies.
00:12:52.646,00:12:54.398,"-And Barb… -Oh, no."
00:12:54.482,00:12:58.694,…the beautiful Barb is giving me permission to come in here by myself now.
00:12:58.777,00:13:04.992,"Cystic fibrosis, as you know, is a genetic disease that basically makes my body produce a shit ton of mucus."
00:13:05.075,00:13:10.122,"Fun fact, I have to be extremely careful around other people with CF."
00:13:10.206,00:13:15.336,The rule is that we're not supposed to get within six feet because we could end up catching each other's bacteria.
00:13:15.419,00:13:29.350,"A lot of people don't realize that new lungs generally only last about five years, which is okay, actually, because most of us are just trying to stay alive long enough for a new treatment to come out."
00:13:29.433,00:13:40.819,"Hi, guys. Just chilling here in my new AffloVest, which is really cool because now I don't have to be hooked up to the wall, which obviously I'm not, because I'm hanging upside down on my bed."
00:13:41.987,00:13:45.157,This is actually good for getting the mucus up and stuff.
00:13:45.241,00:13:46.700,"I know, cute, right?"
00:14:08.138,00:14:11.892,"Dang, girl. You look worn."
00:14:12.476,00:14:13.352,Who is he?
00:14:13.852,00:14:15.354,Is it anyone I know?
00:14:17.189,00:14:18.941,What'd you get?
00:14:22.403,00:14:23.320,What?
00:14:23.404,00:14:26.115,Are those truffles? How'd you get truffles?
00:14:26.198,00:14:27.992,"You gotta bring 'em with, sister."
00:14:28.075,00:14:29.535,Wow.
00:14:31.078,00:14:33.122,Look at how spicy that food cart is.
00:14:36.041,00:14:38.627,I'm single!
00:14:39.420,00:14:40.796,You broke up with Michael?
00:14:40.880,00:14:42.798,Maybe he broke up with me.
00:14:42.882,00:14:43.924,Did he?
00:14:44.008,00:14:45.259,It was mutual.
00:14:46.552,00:14:47.511,"No, it wasn't."
00:14:47.595,00:14:50.681,Why? You actually really liked him.
00:14:50.764,00:14:53.017,And I thought he was gonna be the one.
00:14:53.100,00:14:54.810,He obviously isn't.
00:14:56.979,00:14:58.772,"Screw him anyway, right?"
00:14:58.856,00:15:00.858,At least you got to do that.
00:15:03.444,00:15:06.196,Poe? Poe?
00:15:14.830,00:15:16.248,Choking! 310!
00:15:19.710,00:15:22.838,"I'm sorry, Julie. My legs hit the call button."
00:15:22.922,00:15:24.465,"You scared us, Poe."
00:15:24.548,00:15:27.009,"Yeah, try chewing next time."
00:15:27.092,00:15:28.344,Okay.
00:15:28.844,00:15:29.887,"Here, Stella."
00:15:30.763,00:15:33.807,"Enjoy your truffles, asshole."
00:15:36.393,00:15:38.187,"Please, be careful."
00:15:38.270,00:15:39.855,"I love you, Stella!"
00:15:44.652,00:15:48.656,so we need to be patient and Will needs to help us with that.
00:15:48.739,00:15:54.161,"The risk of cross infection will be even higher now, so… Don't cough on any other CFers."
00:15:54.244,00:15:58.874,"Well, don't get close enough to touch them for their safety and yours."
00:16:04.296,00:16:10.177,"Will, in order for this to work, you need to keep up with your regimen."
00:16:14.223,00:16:16.684,"Okay, well, I will see you soon."
00:16:49.341,00:16:50.968,"Hi, Maya."
00:16:52.177,00:16:55.431,"Oh, I'm officially jealous. That looks so fun!"
00:16:57.725,00:17:01.145,"I miss you too, You have any cute boy visitors?"
00:17:01.228,00:17:03.731,"No. No, he's not cute."
00:17:56.658,00:17:59.244,What are you doing? Do you have a death wish or something?
00:17:59.828,00:18:03.040,"Hey. My lungs are toast, okay?"
00:18:03.123,00:18:07.169,Can you…? Just let me enjoy this view while I can.
00:18:08.003,00:18:10.964,Do you know how lucky you are to be here?
00:18:15.052,00:18:16.929,How do you know about my drug trial?
00:18:18.305,00:18:19.640,You ben asking about me?
00:18:22.434,00:18:26.230,"If you don't care, then leave."
00:18:26.897,00:18:28.107,Give your spot to someone else.
00:18:28.190,00:18:30.692,"Someone that, that wants it, that wants to live."
00:18:35.072,00:18:36.115,Okay.
00:18:39.201,00:18:40.953,What are you doing? Will?
00:18:41.036,00:18:42.704,"Will, no please! Get down!"
00:18:42.788,00:18:44.456,"Will, stop, please!"
00:18:44.540,00:18:46.208,Please get down now!
00:18:46.291,00:18:48.085,"Will, stop! Oh, my god!"
00:18:52.631,00:18:53.507,God!
00:19:00.472,00:19:04.476,Fine. Stay up here then.
00:19:06.228,00:19:08.147,"Come on, it was a joke."
00:19:08.230,00:19:10.190,"Hey, it was a joke!"
00:19:13.986,00:19:15.028,Ugh.
00:20:01.575,00:20:02.659,Dammit.
00:20:25.641,00:20:32.356,"Where's your med cart? And your pills, and… why's your AffloVest vest on the floor? Can… Can I see your regimen?"
00:20:32.439,00:20:36.610,Um… not that it's any of your business.
00:20:44.868,00:20:49.665,Is this what… Why?
00:20:49.748,00:20:51.625,Is this what an aneurysm looks like?
00:20:51.708,00:20:53.293,-Why? -Hey!
00:20:54.503,00:20:58.966,"Look, I get that you have some kind of save-the-world hero complex going on, but can you leave me out of it?"
00:20:59.049,00:21:00.467,These meds are not optional.
00:21:00.550,00:21:02.302,"No, that's probably why they keep shoving 'em them down my throat."
00:21:02.386,00:21:04.346,You're making me crazy.
00:21:16.566,00:21:17.776,Six feet.
00:21:37.671,00:21:42.175,"I need you to follow your regimen strictly and completely, please."
00:21:43.135,00:21:47.514,Why don't… Why don't you tell me what's going on? Actually.
00:21:53.186,00:21:55.230,I have control issues.
00:21:56.231,00:22:04.114,"And I need to know that things are in order, and I know that you're not doing your treatments and it's really, really messing me up."
00:22:04.197,00:22:08.201,"Okay, I wanna help you. I do."
00:22:10.037,00:22:12.456,I don't even know how to do what you're asking me to.
00:22:12.539,00:22:15.042,That's bullshit! That's bullshit!
00:22:15.125,00:22:17.419,All CFers know how to administer their own treatments.
00:22:17.502,00:22:19.254,We're practically doctors by the time we're twelve.
00:22:19.338,00:22:20.339,Are you serious?
00:22:20.422,00:22:22.549,Am I actually messing you up?
00:22:22.632,00:22:24.259,Yes!
00:22:24.343,00:22:26.344,All right.
00:22:27.220,00:22:28.680,I'll help you.
00:22:28.764,00:22:34.394,But if I do… what's in it for me?
00:22:36.396,00:22:40.484,"No, not like… I… I wanna draw you."
00:22:41.777,00:22:42.819,No.
00:22:42.903,00:22:44.780,Why not? I'm serious.
00:22:44.863,00:22:46.490,No.
00:22:51.328,00:22:54.206,Okay. Then no deal.
00:22:55.540,00:22:59.544,You really can't practice just a little bit of discipline even to save your own life?
00:22:59.628,00:23:02.631,"Stella, nothing is going to save our lives."
00:23:02.714,00:23:04.299,We're breathing borrowed air.
00:23:05.842,00:23:07.094,Enjoy it.
00:23:21.983,00:23:23.110,Fine.
00:23:23.193,00:23:25.320,But I'm not posing for hours on end.
00:23:25.403,00:23:26.947,"And your regimen, we're doing it my way."
00:23:27.030,00:23:29.825,"Okay, the first thing you're gonna do is get a med cart in your room. Deal?"
00:23:31.910,00:23:34.121,Deal. Shake on it?
00:23:38.125,00:23:39.751,Funny.
00:24:02.149,00:24:02.983,Hey.
00:24:05.443,00:24:07.571,-You missed the show. -Yeah.
00:24:07.654,00:24:08.780,You doing stunts in there?
00:24:08.864,00:24:10.699,"Well, there's no better place to break a leg."
00:24:10.782,00:24:13.618,That's fair. I'm Will.
00:24:17.247,00:24:18.373,I'm Poe.
00:24:22.377,00:24:23.628,"Damn, that's rough."
00:24:23.712,00:24:25.213,Yeah.
00:24:26.464,00:24:28.258,So no lung transplant for me.
00:24:28.341,00:24:29.885,When did you contract it?
00:24:29.968,00:24:31.469,About eight months ago now.
00:24:31.553,00:24:41.271,Colonized so quickly. I was on the transplant list one minute and then… I'm sure that attitude is what's giving Stella fits.
00:24:43.023,00:24:45.358,She told me that she has control issues or something.
00:24:45.442,00:24:49.112,"Call it what you want, she's got her shit together. She definitely keeps me in line."
00:24:49.196,00:24:58.914,"So, uh… Are you two… No, no, no."
00:24:58.997,00:25:01.499,"I've known that girl since I was, like, seven."
00:25:02.292,00:25:03.793,"I don't know, man."
00:25:05.337,00:25:06.713,Of course I love her.
00:25:06.796,00:25:08.798,So why haven't you done anything about it?
00:25:08.882,00:25:10.467,Because.
00:25:11.426,00:25:12.761,She's not a he.
00:25:18.308,00:25:20.227,Don't worry. I don't like white boys.
00:25:30.237,00:25:33.782,Doctor Hamid said that you suddenly wanna be responsible for your own regimen.
00:25:34.741,00:25:36.743,Don't make me regret this.
00:25:47.504,00:25:48.797,Did you wipe everything down?
00:25:48.880,00:25:50.966,"Yes. This wasn't my idea, you know?"
00:25:55.971,00:25:57.514,Yes. Hurry up.
00:25:58.390,00:25:59.975,I'm almost done.
00:26:35.510,00:26:37.887,Okay. your med cart's all set up.
00:26:37.971,00:26:39.889,I built an app for chronic illnesses.
00:26:39.973,00:26:43.435,"It'll alert you when to do your treatments, -and to take your pills… -Built an app?"
00:26:43.518,00:26:45.603,Like you built it?
00:26:45.687,00:26:47.689,Surprise.
00:26:47.772,00:26:50.525,It's pretty simple. You should be able to figure it out.
00:27:22.932,00:27:26.728,"Don't tell me that the one time you're interested in some guy, he's a CFer."
00:27:26.811,00:27:28.980,I just helped him set up his med cart.
00:27:29.064,00:27:31.441,That's… That's it. That's all!
00:27:31.524,00:27:35.236,"I know you, Stella. Organizing a med cart is like foreplay."
00:27:38.740,00:27:40.867,They're called manners!
00:27:54.005,00:27:56.216,Are you doing your AffloVest?
00:27:58.885,00:28:00.261,Show me.
00:28:00.970,00:28:02.847,I can't. I'm half naked.
00:28:02.931,00:28:07.185,You're supposed to be doing your AffloVest right now and did you take your Creon?
00:28:07.268,00:28:10.397,Are those the suppositories?
00:28:12.732,00:28:13.733,Okay.
00:28:13.817,00:28:21.825,"Okay, I can't trust you, so… this is how it's gonna work. We're gonna do our treatments together so that way I know you're actually doing them. Okay?"
00:28:21.908,00:28:25.328,"Always looking for ways to spend more time with me, aren't you, Stella?"
00:28:26.955,00:28:30.166,I've been doing this since I was a little kid.
00:28:32.335,00:28:35.046,So you just pour them all in the pudding and stir it around.
00:28:35.130,00:28:36.714,Are you doing that?
00:29:33.104,00:29:35.315,"Divorce Diet doesn't look good on you, Mom."
00:29:36.357,00:29:37.400,What're you talking about?
00:29:37.484,00:29:40.570,You're too thin. Dad needs a bath. You guys are stealing my look.
00:29:41.571,00:29:42.947,I'm stealing your look?
00:29:44.574,00:29:45.992,"Okay, maybe I need this more than you do."
00:29:48.286,00:29:49.788,"-Oh, my god. -Gross."
00:29:49.871,00:29:51.539,How did that happen?
00:29:51.623,00:29:54.626,"How did it happen? Oh, man."
00:29:57.045,00:29:58.713,"Aw, here, honey."
00:30:17.357,00:30:18.942,I love you so much.
00:30:20.735,00:30:22.237,I know.
00:30:22.320,00:30:23.780,I love you too.
00:30:24.989,00:30:26.741,I don't know what I'd do without you.
00:30:35.750,00:30:37.502,Mm. How does it feel?
00:30:40.964,00:30:43.758,"Let's try some Bactroban, see how it looks in a day or two."
00:30:43.842,00:30:45.218,"Maybe we can clear it up, huh?"
00:30:47.929,00:30:49.264,"Oh, I'll be at the gym."
00:30:50.348,00:30:51.224,"Thanks, Doc!"
00:30:56.813,00:30:58.439,"Hey, you know, this sucks."
00:30:59.482,00:31:03.069,When does this deal of our become mutually beneficial?
00:31:03.945,00:31:07.866,I've done everything you've asked with no return on my investment.
00:31:09.576,00:31:11.703,You really wanna draw me after we work out?
00:31:11.786,00:31:13.246,Yeah.
00:31:13.955,00:31:17.750,No. I'm gross and sweaty and smell.
00:31:17.834,00:31:19.085,My hair is dirty.
00:31:19.168,00:31:21.462,I'm too tired.
00:31:21.546,00:31:24.048,My med cart is messy.
00:31:24.132,00:31:27.927,Fine. I'll sweat harder then. Just for you.
00:31:41.441,00:31:42.317,What's that?
00:31:42.984,00:31:44.736,My to-do list.
00:31:44.819,00:31:46.571,To-do list?
00:31:46.654,00:31:50.074,Pretty old-fashioned for someone who builds apps.
00:31:50.700,00:31:55.914,"Yeah, well, the app doesn't give me the satisfaction of doing… that."
00:32:00.668,00:32:02.629,What else is on that to-do list of yours?
00:32:02.712,00:32:05.131,My master list or my daily list?
00:32:05.214,00:32:06.925,"Yeah, of course you have two lists."
00:32:07.008,00:32:09.802,"Well, the master list. That's the big stuff, right?"
00:32:11.304,00:32:14.682,Okay. Volunteer in an important political campaign.
00:32:14.766,00:32:15.975,Done.
00:32:16.059,00:32:18.770,Study all the works of William Shakespeare. Done.
00:32:18.853,00:32:22.440,Share everything I know about CF with other people. That's my YouTube page.
00:32:25.777,00:32:29.155,so that you can join the debate team of the dead or something?
00:32:38.039,00:32:40.708,Learn to play piano. Done.
00:32:41.376,00:32:43.419,Speak fluent French.
00:32:43.503,00:32:45.630,J'y travaille.
00:32:49.467,00:32:51.552,-You wanna hear my list? -No.
00:32:52.679,00:32:54.472,Painting class with Bob Ross.
00:32:56.849,00:33:00.228,He's dead. Yeah.
00:33:00.311,00:33:04.983,"But, uh… sex in the Vatican."
00:33:05.066,00:33:07.902,"Uh, I'd rather have painting with Bob Ross."
00:33:09.529,00:33:10.655,I don't know.
00:33:11.948,00:33:13.992,I'd like to travel the world.
00:33:15.034,00:33:19.956,Actually get to see some of it and not… the inside of these hospitals.
00:33:29.966,00:33:30.925,For what?
00:33:32.593,00:33:34.137,For saying something real.
00:33:38.850,00:33:40.184,Was it the Vatican thing?
00:33:40.935,00:33:42.645,Can you hurry up?
00:34:01.539,00:34:04.333,Okay. I just thought you might want to know how this feels. You ready?
00:34:11.507,00:34:14.260,"Ready. Happy birthday, Stella!"
00:34:28.566,00:34:30.651,"I love you, Stella. I'll see you soon."
00:34:44.665,00:34:46.667,I like seeing you like this.
00:34:59.764,00:35:01.307,What if this doesn't work?
00:35:03.351,00:35:04.727,What if it does?
00:35:44.600,00:35:45.935,Ha ha!
00:35:52.400,00:35:54.360,Why cartoons?
00:35:54.443,00:35:56.529,They're subversive.
00:35:57.738,00:36:00.741,They can be light and funny but pack a powerful punch.
00:36:00.825,00:36:04.120,I think a well-drawn cartoon can say a lot more than words ever could.
00:36:04.203,00:36:05.580,Yeah?
00:36:05.663,00:36:07.623,What does this say exactly?
00:36:08.541,00:36:11.711,A lot more than words ever could.
00:36:11.794,00:36:14.046,I think it's actually pretty good.
00:36:14.130,00:36:16.215,I think that's really good behind you.
00:36:16.299,00:36:17.675,What is that?
00:36:17.758,00:36:20.303,"Oh, those are lungs. That's brilliant."
00:36:20.386,00:36:21.888,Did you do that?
00:36:21.971,00:36:24.599,"Uh, no. My older sister Abby."
00:36:24.682,00:36:26.058,Wow. She's really good.
00:36:26.142,00:36:28.477,I'd love to see more of her stuff. Do you have any?
00:36:29.937,00:36:34.233,"We don't have to, uh, share our stories, okay?"
00:36:34.317,00:36:36.027,We can just do our treatments together.
00:36:43.868,00:36:50.666,"Hey, guys! I have to get a nasal poly… Polypectomy. We're removing polyps from your nasal passages."
00:36:50.750,00:36:52.043,And Stella's nervous.
00:36:52.126,00:36:55.087,But I'm gonna be there to sing her to sleep. Just like always.
00:37:08.976,00:37:13.606,But seriously… I'm gonna be there when you go to sleep and I'm gonna be right here when you wake up.
00:37:15.775,00:37:17.068,Okay?
00:37:18.402,00:37:19.570,Okay.
00:37:20.780,00:37:21.739,I love you.
00:37:21.822,00:37:22.990,I love you too.
00:37:23.658,00:37:25.451,"My sister, Abby, ladies and gentlemen."
00:37:25.534,00:37:27.286,"-She's single, by the way. -Okay. Stop it."
00:37:27.370,00:37:29.247,-Her digits are… -Stop it!
00:37:29.956,00:37:30.957,That was last year.
00:37:31.040,00:37:33.209,Abby's not in any of the videos after that.
00:37:33.709,00:37:35.044,I found Abby's Instagram.
00:37:35.127,00:37:38.714,"I mean, it's mostly art, her and Stella, but you're right."
00:37:39.507,00:37:41.384,"I mean, she hasn't posted in, like, a year."
00:37:54.021,00:37:56.232,"Barb didn't see you come in, did she?"
00:37:56.315,00:37:57.358,No.
00:38:09.203,00:38:11.372,"Abby's dead, isn't she?"
00:38:14.959,00:38:17.044,You're as delicate as a jackhammer.
00:38:17.920,00:38:20.798,"We don't have time for delicacy, Stella. We're dying."
00:38:21.924,00:38:25.094,Can you stop reminding me that I'm dying?
00:38:28.973,00:38:30.266,I just can't.
00:38:30.349,00:38:31.892,I've been dying my whole life.
00:38:31.976,00:38:34.979,"Every birthday, we celebrated it like it was my last one."
00:38:41.444,00:38:43.654,And then my parents' marriage died.
00:38:43.738,00:38:45.865,And it was supposed to be me.
00:38:45.948,00:38:49.035,Everyone was ready for that. Everyone was prepared for that.
00:38:49.118,00:38:50.745,"I just, I can't die."
00:38:52.913,00:38:55.291,I just-- My parents… I can't.
00:38:55.958,00:38:58.085,Is this why you're so obsessed with your regimen?
00:39:02.256,00:39:05.176,Will… You're a sick girl with survivor's guilt.
00:39:05.259,00:39:09.263,"-This is out of your control. -Look, look. I… -This has never been-- -Will, I just don't have any other choice."
00:39:09.347,00:39:10.806,-You do. -Okay?
00:39:10.890,00:39:12.224,"-I don't! Will, I dont. -You do."
00:39:13.517,00:39:15.895,"Okay, Stella. Hey, I'm sorry."
00:39:15.978,00:39:18.147,"We're supposed to be medita-- Stella, come on!"
00:39:22.485,00:39:24.862,"For what it's worth, I don't think he meant to hurt you."
00:39:24.945,00:39:26.655,"Yeah, but it's still annoying."
00:39:26.739,00:39:30.409,"Like, he said Abby and dead in the same sentence like it was no big deal."
00:39:36.540,00:39:38.084,I should've been there.
00:39:40.711,00:39:41.837,Stella.
00:39:42.421,00:39:44.548,"Stella, look at me."
00:39:46.592,00:39:48.260,You just can't.
00:39:48.886,00:39:50.596,Stop torturing yourself.
00:39:51.639,00:39:53.682,"Oh, this disease is a prison."
00:39:54.809,00:39:56.352,I wanna hug you.
00:39:57.353,00:39:59.897,Just pretend that I'm doing it right now.
00:40:02.858,00:40:03.776,You know I love you.
00:40:05.152,00:40:06.529,I love you too.
00:40:08.781,00:40:10.491,You wanna get ice cream?
00:40:10.574,00:40:12.451,-Yes. -Come on.
00:40:40.354,00:40:41.188,Hey.
00:40:42.440,00:40:44.733,It's gonna be okay.
00:40:44.817,00:40:45.985,You don't know that.
00:40:46.819,00:40:49.447,You're right. I don't. It's risky.
00:40:50.406,00:40:52.491,But sepsis is the bigger monster.
00:40:54.785,00:40:55.828,Hey.
00:40:57.413,00:41:00.458,"You're a fighter, Stella Grant. You always have been."
00:41:04.420,00:41:07.381,So… yeah?
00:41:08.466,00:41:10.217,Yeah.
00:41:10.301,00:41:12.219,Tomorrow morning then.
00:41:14.054,00:41:15.848,I'll let your parents know.
00:42:09.026,00:42:10.027,Hey.
00:42:11.737,00:42:12.780,You're here.
00:42:13.489,00:42:17.159,I'm here. I got your cartoon. You're forgiven. Back up.
00:42:20.204,00:42:22.414,You missed our treatment. What's going on?
00:42:22.498,00:42:24.250,Infected G-tube.
00:42:24.959,00:42:28.629,"Dr. Hamid's worried about sepsis, so she's replacing it in the morning."
00:42:29.588,00:42:31.882,-I'm going under general. -Shit.
00:42:31.966,00:42:33.634,Are your lungs up for that?
00:42:35.094,00:42:38.639,"Do your nebulizer at eight, and your AffloVest, okay?"
00:43:45.456,00:43:47.249,What are you doing here?
00:43:47.333,00:43:49.960,"I thought this was the bathroom, honestly."
00:43:51.629,00:43:53.422,It's your first surgery without Abby.
00:43:54.506,00:43:56.258,How do you know that?
00:43:59.428,00:44:02.723,Some might say I'm your biggest fan.
00:44:02.806,00:44:05.809,"So, I really hope that I don't mess this up."
00:44:27.915,00:44:30.000,My grandma used to sing that to us.
00:44:30.084,00:44:33.212,I had to Google it. It's really old.
00:44:46.809,00:44:48.477,you're gonna be okay.
00:44:49.353,00:44:50.437,Promise?
00:44:58.237,00:44:59.571,Hey.
00:44:59.655,00:45:01.782,You ready to get this show on the road?
00:45:02.491,00:45:03.992,Yeah.
00:45:22.886,00:45:25.139,She was scared.
00:45:25.222,00:45:27.057,i just wanted to do something nice.
00:45:34.022,00:45:37.443,She's in more danger under the anesthesia than she is with me.
00:45:41.238,00:45:49.913,Trevor Von That's who you remind me of. Trevor Von and Amy Presley.
00:45:49.997,00:45:53.417,"Oh, they were… they were in love."
00:45:55.085,00:45:57.796,And I let them break the rules so they could be happy.
00:45:57.880,00:46:00.007,And let me guess.
00:46:00.632,00:46:01.675,They died.
00:46:01.758,00:46:03.594,"Yes, Will They did."
00:46:05.554,00:46:07.806,On my watch.
00:46:10.267,00:46:13.228,And I'd be damned if I let that happen again.
00:46:36.043,00:46:37.878,It's going to be okay.
00:46:56.563,00:46:57.898,You know what to do.
00:46:57.981,00:48:06.925,Mm-hmm seven… Oh. Huh.
00:48:42.919,00:48:47.841,"Call me, 'cause… i miss you, okay?"
00:48:48.634,00:48:52.054,"But don't call me, 'cause I just got out of surgery and I'm really tired."
00:48:53.096,00:48:58.644,"But call me, though, when you get this because… you're cute."
00:49:02.522,00:49:08.528,"and your fluffy, little hair, and your little, skinny legs."
00:49:11.907,00:49:22.000,"Don't call me, though, because… if I hear your sexy voice, I won't be able to sleep, so… Call me when you get this, okay?"
00:49:23.251,00:49:24.628,Bye.
00:50:40.704,00:50:42.914,Will's not coming.
00:50:47.461,00:50:49.171,I'm not leaving until you open the door.
00:50:52.883,00:50:54.551,I can't.
00:50:57.763,00:51:00.932,Just please open the door and we can talk about this. Okay?
00:51:01.016,00:51:04.352,I don't care what Barb said. Just open the door!
00:51:04.436,00:51:07.647,"Stella, I can't."
00:51:37.052,00:51:39.596,We don't get to take chances like this.
00:51:39.679,00:51:42.098,"Oh, come on. You're not gonna give me that, too?"
00:51:42.182,00:51:43.308,Admit what's going on here.
00:51:43.391,00:51:46.061,"Will's a risk taker, just like Abby."
00:51:47.938,00:51:49.272,What's that supposed to mean?
00:51:51.399,00:51:54.027,You think that I'm the one that's afraid to take risks?
00:51:54.110,00:51:58.031,What about you and your life and… your relationships?
00:51:58.114,00:52:00.867,"You and Tim, you and Rick, -you and Michael. -Don't go there."
00:52:00.951,00:52:02.035,"Oh, I could keep going."
00:52:02.118,00:52:04.120,They knew you were sick and they loved you.
00:52:04.204,00:52:06.331,"You were the one who ran. Every time, you ran."
00:52:06.414,00:52:07.624,You don't know what you're talking about.
00:52:07.707,00:52:11.461,"You ruined every chance you've ever had at love, so just keep your advice to yourself."
00:53:36.046,00:53:37.255,Bitch.
00:53:37.881,00:53:39.466,Asshole.
00:53:40.634,00:53:42.093,You know you're right.
00:53:45.722,00:53:47.599,You know what someone gets for loving me?
00:53:48.308,00:53:50.393,They get to pay for all my care.
00:53:50.477,00:53:52.270,And then they get to watch me die.
00:53:57.442,00:54:00.445,"When I turn eighteen, there's no more full coverage."
00:54:00.528,00:54:02.614,Who should I put that on?
00:54:02.697,00:54:04.366,Michael or my family?
00:54:05.075,00:54:06.868,"It's my sickness, it's my problem."
00:54:09.454,00:54:11.915,Maybe we can get Will to marry you. He's loaded.
00:54:13.208,00:54:15.543,He's not picky. He likes you.
00:54:21.383,00:54:22.801,I am sorry.
00:54:23.843,00:54:25.220,About you and Will.
00:54:43.613,00:54:45.031,Hey.
00:54:47.075,00:54:48.284,Stella?
00:55:20.191,00:55:21.151,Hello.
00:55:21.234,00:55:25.238,There is something a little bit different I want to talk about today.
00:55:26.031,00:55:28.241,Burkholderia Cepacia.
00:55:29.200,00:55:34.205,"The risks, the restrictions, and the rules of engagement."
00:55:34.289,00:55:38.501,B. cepacia is a hardy bacteria.
00:55:38.585,00:55:43.965,"Okay, it is so adaptive that it literally feeds on penicillin."
00:55:44.841,00:55:52.640,"So, our first line of defense is Cal Stat, a hospital-grade hand sterilizer."
00:55:52.724,00:55:56.227,Apply liberally and often.
00:55:56.311,00:56:00.607,Next is good old-fashioned latex!
00:56:00.690,00:56:06.154,Tried-and-true. Used for protection in all types of activities.
00:56:07.572,00:56:12.577,B. cepacia thrives best in saliva or phlegm.
00:56:12.660,00:56:23.797,"Fun fact, a cough can travel six feet, a sneeze can travel up to two-hundred miles per hour. But, the no saliva thing also means no kissing."
00:56:24.506,00:56:25.715,Ever.
00:56:25.799,00:56:29.302,So our best defense is distance.
00:56:29.928,00:56:32.388,Six feet. At all times.
00:56:33.181,00:56:36.476,Ta-da! Here's a pool cue!
00:56:36.559,00:56:38.937,It measures approximately five feet.
00:56:40.438,00:56:42.607,Five feet.
00:56:42.690,00:56:45.568,I've given a lot of thought to foot number six.
00:56:46.611,00:56:48.571,"And, you know what? It made me mad."
00:56:49.739,00:56:53.785,"When you have cystic fibrosis, so much is taken from you."
00:56:54.452,00:56:58.665,"You live every day of your life according to treatments, and pills, and schedules."
00:56:58.748,00:57:00.834,Most of us can't have children.
00:57:00.917,00:57:04.045,A lot of us don't even live long enough to try to have children.
00:57:04.129,00:57:11.678,"Shit, it's complicated to try to explain, but… it's even hard to fall in love."
00:57:13.388,00:57:21.229,"So, after all that CF has stolen from me, from us, I don't mind stealing a little something back."
00:57:22.063,00:57:23.815,One foot.
00:57:24.774,00:57:30.280,"One fucking foot of space, of distance, of length or whatever you wanna call it."
00:57:30.363,00:57:32.407,I don't mind stealing that back.
00:57:33.116,00:57:41.249,Because CF… you're not the thief anymore. I'm the thief now.
00:57:41.332,00:57:43.334,Boom.
00:57:54.429,00:57:57.682,Five feet apart. Deal?
00:58:00.477,00:58:01.853,Are you in?
00:58:13.114,00:58:14.657,I'm so in.
00:58:20.246,00:58:22.457,Atrium. Nine o' clock.
00:58:33.384,00:58:35.303,Why didn't I pack anything nice?
00:58:35.386,00:58:38.890,"Oh, 'cause you always pack for a hot hospital romance."
00:59:07.835,00:59:09.420,Is this see-through?
00:59:10.505,00:59:12.257,"Don't even think about it, ho."
00:59:44.998,00:59:46.082,Hi.
00:59:47.250,00:59:48.334,Hi.
01:00:13.985,01:00:16.863,I guess having a sick kid wasn't part of his plan.
01:00:17.780,01:00:19.324,What about your mom?
01:00:19.407,01:00:22.327,She's beautiful and driven and smart.
01:00:22.410,01:00:25.663,She's just focused on me and me alone.
01:00:27.248,01:00:31.544,"So, starting tomorrow when I'm eighteen, I will be making the decisions for myself."
01:00:31.628,01:00:33.421,"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
01:00:33.504,01:00:35.340,Tomorrow's your birthday?
01:00:36.758,01:00:39.552,You could've told me that. I don't have a present for you.
01:00:41.638,01:00:44.390,How about you just promise to stick around for the next one?
01:00:55.526,01:01:00.782,"There is this one theory I like that says to understand death, you have to look at birth."
01:01:02.533,01:01:12.877,"So, like, while we're in the womb, we're living that existence, not knowing that our next existence is just an inch away."
01:01:12.960,01:01:16.714,"So, maybe it's the same with death."
01:01:16.798,01:01:22.095,"Maybe death is just the next life, but an inch away."
01:01:23.638,01:01:26.974,"Or maybe it's just the big sleep, baby."
01:01:28.184,01:01:31.020,Lights out. Done and done.
01:01:32.397,01:01:34.357,No.
01:01:36.192,01:01:42.115,"No, there's no way that Abby just blinked out."
01:01:42.198,01:01:44.200,I refuse to believe it.
01:01:46.202,01:01:48.913,What happened? To Abby?
01:01:53.209,01:01:56.129,She was cliff diving in California.
01:01:57.296,01:01:59.716,"She landed wrong, broke her neck and drowned."
01:02:03.720,01:02:09.434,"They said she didn't feel any pain, but… how would they know if she felt pain?"
01:02:12.979,01:02:16.441,But i got sick like I always do.
01:02:18.901,01:02:21.195,I just keep imagining it over and over again.
01:02:22.613,01:02:24.282,What she was feeling.
01:02:30.204,01:02:32.874,"Without knowing that, she just never stops dying."
01:02:32.957,01:02:37.378,"Stella. Even if you were there, you still wouldn't know."
01:02:37.920,01:02:39.714,But I wasn't there.
01:02:42.675,01:02:44.427,She died alone.
01:02:46.429,01:02:48.723,Isn't that how we're gonna die?
01:02:50.933,01:02:53.144,Drowning. Just without the water.
01:02:54.437,01:02:56.272,Our own fluids doing the dirty work.
01:03:00.902,01:03:02.653,I think about that last breath a lot.
01:03:04.113,01:03:06.407,Gasping for air.
01:03:07.033,01:03:08.576,Not getting any.
01:03:10.286,01:03:14.665,"No air, just… black."
01:03:16.834,01:03:18.586,"Well, that's only on Mondays."
01:03:18.669,01:03:20.171,"Otherwise, I don't swell on it."
01:03:24.967,01:03:26.427,There's that smile.
01:03:32.725,01:03:34.435,"God, you're beautiful."
01:03:42.693,01:03:44.153,I wish I could touch you.
01:04:39.792,01:04:40.793,I've never had sex.
01:04:45.464,01:04:54.974,"I've never wanted anyone to see me. The scars, the… The tube. Nothing about it is sexy."
01:04:56.684,01:04:58.352,Everything about you is sexy.
01:05:01.230,01:05:02.565,I think you're perfect.
01:07:09.400,01:07:11.193,-Morning. -Good morning.
01:07:20.578,01:07:33.049,"Abby and I would call them stars… She'd never tell me what her wish was, but… I knew she wished for new lungs for me."
01:07:35.176,01:07:36.635,I hope she gets her wish.
01:07:43.017,01:07:44.477,"Morning, Robert."
01:08:10.669,01:08:12.421,Where are they?
01:08:13.631,01:08:15.341,Who?
01:08:15.424,01:08:17.051,What are you talking about?
01:08:30.439,01:08:32.316,"Oh, shit. Barb knows we're gone."
01:08:32.399,01:08:39.406,"-Okay. -Uh… Uh, she'll look for me first in the NICU, so… Bye. Okay."
01:10:14.793,01:10:16.545,I'm free!
01:10:17.379,01:10:20.633,"Oh. Oh, my gosh."
01:10:20.716,01:10:24.094,Happy birthday. I'm so sorry I forgot.
01:10:24.178,01:10:27.097,"No, it's fine. What're you doing? Are you busy? Let's take a walk."
01:10:27.181,01:10:29.141,I can't right now.
01:10:29.225,01:10:32.228,I'm sorry. Studying.
01:10:33.979,01:10:36.106,My friends are actually coming later.
01:10:36.190,01:10:38.609,"No, it's all right. We'll figure something out."
01:10:40.069,01:10:43.364,I was just missing you.
01:10:46.700,01:10:48.702,Talk to you later.
01:10:56.252,01:10:57.461,Jason.
01:10:59.630,01:11:02.049,"Yeah, no. Don't, no, don't worry about it. It's fine."
01:11:06.428,01:11:08.347,It's fine. Just do your thing.
01:13:50.008,01:13:51.552,Thought you'd never find me.
01:13:54.346,01:13:56.014,I know it's late.
01:13:56.098,01:13:58.475,"Uh, we had to wait until the cafeteria closed."
01:13:59.268,01:14:00.102,We?
01:14:06.358,01:14:08.110,Surprise!
01:14:11.405,01:14:13.615,"We felt so bad for ditching you, dude."
01:14:13.699,01:14:16.910,But your girlfriend DM'd us and convinced us to surprise you.
01:14:24.376,01:14:25.544,Where do you wanna sit?
01:14:25.627,01:14:27.421,And he's even hotter in person.
01:14:39.641,01:14:42.144,Just wanted to observe the master at work.
01:14:42.227,01:14:44.062,Are those roses?
01:14:44.146,01:14:44.980,Mm-hm.
01:14:47.024,01:14:49.359,They're so beautiful. How do you do that?
01:14:49.443,01:14:51.195,I've been practicing.
01:14:55.157,01:14:58.160,"'Cause next month, Michael and I are gonna go see my mom."
01:15:01.413,01:15:03.665,He's coming to lunch tomorrow and I'm gonna go for it.
01:15:04.958,01:15:06.335,"Oh, my god."
01:15:08.170,01:15:09.505,He loves me.
01:15:10.589,01:15:12.174,And I love him too.
01:15:12.716,01:15:17.387,"Oh, Poe. I'm so… -I'm so happy. -Don't go all sloppy on me."
01:15:17.471,01:15:19.431,You know I can't let a girl cry alone.
01:15:21.600,01:15:23.894,They're… they're happy tears.
01:15:23.977,01:15:25.479,"I'm happy for you, Poe."
01:15:48.168,01:15:50.337,"Poe, where did you get all of this?"
01:15:50.420,01:15:53.590,Hospitals have VIP kitchens where they keep all the good stuff.
01:15:53.674,01:15:58.679,"You know, for celebrities, politicians. But tonight, Birthday Boy, it's for you."
01:16:00.889,01:16:02.224,Salud.
01:16:16.989,01:16:18.657,We were like ten!
01:16:18.740,01:16:23.495,Yes. And we literally put sheets over our head and ran into the dementia ward!
01:16:27.249,01:16:29.001,Just like that!
01:16:29.084,01:16:30.002,Poe.
01:16:32.754,01:16:34.673,It was the best Halloween ever!
01:16:35.549,01:16:37.509,We got in so much trouble.
01:16:37.593,01:16:41.430,And it wasn't even our idea. Remember? Abby. Abby came up with that.
01:16:51.148,01:16:52.941,Abby was wild.
01:16:55.819,01:16:58.989,She always said she was gonna live big because Stella couldn't.
01:16:59.781,01:17:01.074,She did.
01:17:01.158,01:17:02.868,-She lived big. -Mm-hm.
01:17:05.871,01:17:08.123,She would've loved a clandestine party like this one!
01:17:08.206,01:17:09.541,She would've.
01:17:28.894,01:17:30.854,Make a wish.
01:17:36.068,01:17:37.986,I can't blow the candles out or else you guys can't eat it.
01:17:47.704,01:17:59.841,"One, two, three… Barb. Hey."
01:18:03.011,01:18:05.263,You want us to fix you a plate?
01:18:06.598,01:18:08.141,That's it. That's it.
01:18:08.225,01:18:11.019,You're all confined to your rooms while we get respiratory cultures.
01:18:11.103,01:18:13.855,"And, you. You'll be transferred in the morning."
01:18:13.939,01:18:15.899,"Barb! Barb, it wasn't his fault."
01:18:15.982,01:18:18.819,"Well, you might be willing to gamble with your lives, but I'm not!"
01:18:18.902,01:18:20.570,Just like when we were kids.
01:18:20.654,01:18:22.406,"But you're not kids anymore, Poe."
01:18:22.489,01:18:24.408,But we were safe like you taught us to be.
01:18:24.491,01:18:25.951,Ugh!
01:18:26.034,01:18:28.120,"I'm sorry, but it was fun!"
01:18:58.984,01:19:01.236,-A little pick me up? -Thank you.
01:19:02.154,01:19:04.489,It's just safer if he goes.
01:19:05.240,01:19:07.033,You're probably right.
01:19:07.117,01:19:08.744,She's gonna hate me.
01:19:13.081,01:19:14.583,"What's up, Poe?"
01:19:16.710,01:19:18.920,He probably sat on the call button again. I got it.
01:19:38.315,01:19:39.566,"-Stay with me. -Oh, Poe!"
01:19:43.361,01:19:44.529,He's not breathing. He's not breathing.
01:19:51.536,01:19:53.121,"Come on, babe."
01:20:02.005,01:20:03.423,"Come on, sweetie. Come on, sweetie."
01:20:05.467,01:20:07.969,Somebody get her out of here! Close that door!
01:20:18.438,01:20:19.773,"Not now, Stella."
01:20:19.856,01:20:21.066,Dr. Hamid?
01:20:27.489,01:20:28.657,I'm so sorry.
01:20:32.369,01:20:33.495,No!
01:20:34.913,01:20:36.540,I'm so sorry.
01:20:59.437,01:21:01.773,"Oh, my God! He's gone!"
01:21:02.357,01:21:06.278,Michael's never gonna see him again. His parents are never gonna see him again.
01:21:19.332,01:21:23.920,I never hugged him! He's my best friend and I never fucking hugged him!
01:21:31.553,01:21:33.513,I'm losing everyone.
01:21:33.597,01:21:35.181,Hey. You're not losing me.
01:21:35.849,01:21:37.767,What-- what are you doing?
01:21:38.476,01:21:41.354,Get out! Get out!
01:21:42.022,01:21:43.481,Just get out!
01:24:46.539,01:24:48.208,I wanna go see the lights.
01:24:49.459,01:24:51.294,"It's gotta be, like, two miles away."
01:24:53.171,01:24:55.215,"-Hey, come on. Let's go inside. -I'm going."
01:24:56.674,01:24:57.759,Come with me.
01:24:58.593,01:25:00.929,"Stella, now's not the time to be rebellious."
01:25:01.012,01:25:01.930,Is this about Poe?
01:25:02.013,01:25:03.306,It is about Pow.
01:25:03.389,01:25:07.644,"It's about Abby, it's about you and me, and all the things that we'll never get to do together."
01:25:09.229,01:25:14.859,This whole time I've been living for my treatments instead of doing my treatments so that I can live.
01:25:16.861,01:25:18.279,I want to live.
01:25:22.617,01:25:26.037,"I wanna live. It's just life, Will. It'll be over before we know it."
01:25:31.626,01:25:33.461,All right.
01:25:35.255,01:25:37.173,Can we catch a cab at least?
01:25:38.466,01:25:40.802,I wanna walk and enjoy the night.
01:25:44.264,01:25:46.391,Glove. We're good.
01:26:02.657,01:26:04.701,How are you always getting me to exercise?
01:26:50.830,01:26:52.123,What's that?
01:26:53.458,01:26:54.500,Oh.
01:26:56.002,01:26:58.171,"Yeah, you're gonna have to explain that one."
01:27:01.591,01:27:04.594,Abby got it for me the first time I came to the hospital.
01:27:05.303,01:27:06.804,I've had it with me every time since.
01:27:09.432,01:27:14.229,"That's a relief, honestly, because I didn't have the heart to tell you that a third boob might be a deal breaker."
01:27:46.219,01:27:47.136,"Hey, Stella?"
01:27:50.265,01:27:51.307,It's cold.
01:28:02.151,01:28:04.570,Come on. Let's go see your lights.
01:28:17.500,01:28:18.710,Let's take a breather.
01:28:31.514,01:28:33.016,Stella.
01:28:33.099,01:28:34.225,It's frozen solid.
01:28:46.738,01:28:48.740,I just got a call from St. Luke's in Kansas City.
01:28:48.823,01:28:57.623,"Car accident with fatalities. One female, AB neg, five foot two, thoracic cage size is… Get her prepped."
01:29:07.675,01:29:11.721,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
01:29:47.840,01:29:49.133,Hey.
01:29:50.968,01:29:52.595,Everything all right?
01:30:03.022,01:30:04.524,Yeah.
01:30:08.027,01:30:09.862,"Yeah, I'm good."
01:30:22.083,01:30:23.167,"I love you, Stella."
01:30:45.690,01:30:46.941,I love you too.
01:31:22.602,01:31:23.978,I can't.
01:31:29.567,01:31:30.568,I know.
01:31:32.820,01:31:51.964,So… -Oh. -Oooh.
01:31:54.592,01:31:55.468,Come on.
01:31:58.596,01:32:03.935,"Barb, Barb, Barb… She's not answering and now it's going straight to voicemail."
01:32:04.018,01:32:05.895,But Stella would never run off. She wouldn't do that.
01:32:05.978,01:32:07.063,Have you been able to reach him?
01:32:07.146,01:32:09.190,-Don't you dare tell me… -This is Will's mother.
01:32:09.273,01:32:10.107,How long have they been gone?
01:32:10.191,01:32:14.695,-At least an hour. -If your son -causes Stella to lose these lungs… -My son is just as sick as your daughter is.
01:32:14.779,01:32:16.739,Stella would never do anything like this. She's never done anything like this.
01:32:16.822,01:32:18.658,"Stella did this, Erin, not Will."
01:32:18.741,01:32:20.493,He doesn't know anything about the lungs.
01:32:20.576,01:32:23.537,Lungs? Is there a transplant?
01:32:23.621,01:32:25.748,"-Yes. -Yeah, for Stella. They're on the way."
01:32:28.334,01:32:29.377,Do you like cats?
01:32:29.460,01:32:32.088,I owned a ferret. I was a ferret kid.
01:32:32.630,01:32:34.548,"Oh, no. You would be a ferret kid."
01:32:36.926,01:32:38.261,-Don't answer it. -Come on.
01:32:38.344,01:32:40.179,"-Really, what do they need… -It's my mom."
01:32:40.263,01:32:42.890,"-Yeah, but just… -Let me just tell her that I'm okay."
01:32:48.020,01:32:49.397,"Stella, they have new lungs for you."
01:32:51.399,01:32:54.360,"Hey, they have new lungs for you. Let's go to the hospital. Come on."
01:32:54.443,01:32:55.945,I haven't seen the lights yet.
01:32:57.071,01:32:59.824,The lights. Did you know about this?
01:32:59.907,01:33:02.159,What are we doing out here? Let's go to the hospital. Come on.
01:33:02.243,01:33:03.744,"Five years, Will."
01:33:03.828,01:33:06.831,-Years? -That's the shelf-life of… Five years is a lifetime -for people like us. -It's not!
01:33:06.914,01:33:09.292,"-Let's not be stupid. -When they fail… -Can we go to the hospital, please? -…I'm back to square one."
01:33:09.375,01:33:13.170,"-Come on, let's go. -Will? Will… Stella! Stella?"
01:33:26.559,01:33:28.728,"Come on, please?"
01:33:28.811,01:33:30.021,It's cold.
01:33:33.649,01:33:34.900,Stella!
01:34:39.882,01:34:41.550,Help!
01:34:53.396,01:34:55.314,"Come on, Stella."
01:35:13.457,01:35:16.085,Come on. Come on!
01:35:20.798,01:35:22.341,"Come on, Stella."
01:36:59.271,01:37:01.190,We already have lungs for her.
01:37:01.273,01:37:03.108,"-Can someone get the other mask on? -Oh, my god. Oh, my god."
01:37:06.570,01:37:08.697,My son! My son was out there too!
01:37:08.781,01:37:09.907,"Sorry, step back, please."
01:37:14.453,01:37:16.914,No! Will!
01:37:18.040,01:37:19.500,-Is he okay? -He's okay.
01:37:24.880,01:37:26.215,He's okay. He's okay.
01:37:26.298,01:37:27.466,We're gonna need more blankets in here.
01:37:31.136,01:37:33.430,-Honey? -Stella? Stella?
01:37:33.514,01:37:34.765,You need to calm down.
01:37:34.848,01:37:37.476,We have your new lungs in the other… -Yes. Stella. -I don't want them.
01:37:37.560,01:37:39.103,I don't want them.
01:37:39.186,01:37:40.938,"Stella, we've been waiting for these lungs for years."
01:37:41.021,01:37:42.856,What are you talking about?
01:37:42.940,01:37:44.525,"We don't use the lungs, they're wasted, sweetie."
01:37:44.608,01:37:47.027,I love him. The new lungs won't mean anything without him.
01:37:47.111,01:37:48.237,-Lay down. -Put your mask back on.
01:37:52.616,01:37:54.076,Will!
01:37:55.661,01:37:56.745,Please.
01:37:58.414,01:37:59.957,Take the lungs.
01:38:00.833,01:38:02.459,"Please, for me."
01:38:10.467,01:38:11.844,"Okay, okay. Okay."
01:38:15.389,01:38:17.057,Okay? I love you so much.
01:38:24.273,01:38:26.317,I gave her mouth to mouth.
01:38:28.611,01:38:30.195,"I'm sorry, I didn't have any other choice."
01:38:30.279,01:38:31.447,"You saved her life, Will."
01:38:31.530,01:38:33.574,"If she has B. cepacia, we'll deal with it, okay?"
01:40:30.232,01:40:31.775,Bacterial cultures came back.
01:40:33.026,01:40:35.779,"I don't know how, but she's clean."
01:40:36.321,01:40:38.323,She didn't get it.
01:40:41.869,01:40:43.328,But that doesn't mean she won't.
01:40:47.583,01:40:49.752,What about Will?
01:40:57.009,01:40:58.469,No.
01:41:00.179,01:41:02.264,"No, it's not."
01:41:09.897,01:41:12.357,I'm sorry.
01:41:15.736,01:41:17.571,"No, no, no, no, sweetie."
01:41:19.114,01:41:20.866,It's not your fault.
01:42:26.223,01:42:27.850,Hey.
01:42:27.933,01:42:30.352,"What? What is it? What is it, honey?"
01:42:30.435,01:42:32.729,Could you help me with something?
01:42:37.442,01:42:38.735,You guys in?
01:42:38.819,01:42:40.612,-Absolutely. -Yeah.
01:42:40.696,01:42:42.281,Barb?
01:42:44.533,01:42:46.201,"Hell, yeah. I'm in."
01:42:47.077,01:42:49.162,She's sedated. We have a few more hours.
01:42:49.246,01:42:51.081,We have time.
01:42:52.457,01:42:53.500,They said yes.
01:43:32.623,01:43:34.750,-HI. You really did. -You did great.
01:43:34.833,01:43:36.084,You did.
01:43:53.644,01:43:55.145,We have something for you.
01:44:04.446,01:44:07.324,I guess it's true. What that book of yours says.
01:44:07.407,01:44:09.743,That the soul knows no time.
01:44:11.745,01:44:13.455,My drug trial's not working.
01:44:15.123,01:44:19.711,But I want you to know that this past month will last forever for me.
01:44:20.754,01:44:23.590,My only regret is that you didn't get to see your lights.
01:45:18.603,01:45:21.064,Finally got you speechless.
01:45:25.610,01:45:28.905,"You know, people are always saying if you love something you have to learn to let it go."
01:45:30.657,01:45:32.701,I thought that was such bullshit.
01:45:35.078,01:45:36.621,Till I watched you almost die.
01:45:38.123,01:45:44.296,"In that moment, Stella, nothing mattered to me."
01:45:45.922,01:45:47.382,Except you.
01:45:52.054,01:45:53.430,I'm sorry.
01:45:57.726,01:45:58.935,I don't wanna go.
01:46:02.230,01:46:03.857,All I want is to be with you.
01:46:08.320,01:46:13.533,I can't I need you to be safe.
01:46:14.201,01:46:15.577,From me.
01:46:19.331,01:46:21.458,i don't know what comes next.
01:46:22.626,01:46:24.836,But I don't regret any of this.
01:46:29.591,01:46:31.134,Could you close your eyes?
01:46:32.844,01:46:36.056,I just don't know if I could walk away with you still looking at me.
01:46:43.772,01:46:44.940,Please.
01:47:02.332,01:47:03.583,I love you.
01:47:05.001,01:47:06.211,So much.
01:47:35.490,01:47:37.242,He left this for you.
01:49:11.127,01:49:13.588,Our first form of communication.
01:49:13.672,01:49:14.631,"Say, hi, Auntie Stella."
01:49:14.714,01:49:20.262,"Safety, security, comfort all in the gentle caress of a finger."
01:49:21.554,01:49:24.057,Or at the brush of lips on a soft cheek.
01:49:26.184,01:49:28.436,It connects us when we're happy.
01:49:32.065,01:49:33.525,Bolsters us in times of fear.
01:49:35.735,01:49:36.903,No!
01:49:36.987,01:49:39.739,Excites us in times of passion.
01:49:39.823,01:49:43.493,"Uh, no! Stella, no. Stop!"
01:49:43.576,01:49:45.412,In love.
01:49:48.832,01:49:52.669,We need that touch from the one we love almost as much as we need air to breathe.
01:49:54.462,01:49:57.132,But I never understood the importance of touch.
01:49:59.301,01:50:00.468,His touch.
01:50:02.846,01:50:04.431,Until I couldn't have it.
01:50:08.643,01:50:18.862,"So, if you're watching this, and you're able, Touch him."
01:50:18.945,01:50:20.655,Touch her.
01:50:22.741,01:50:24.701,Life's too short to waste a second.
