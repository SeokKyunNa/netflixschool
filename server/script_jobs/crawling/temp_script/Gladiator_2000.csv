00:03:17.823,00:03:21.118,- Sir.
00:03:21.160,00:03:23.662,- General.
00:03:23.704,00:03:25.789,General.
00:03:25.831,00:03:28.207,- Sir.
00:03:28.249,00:03:29.668,General.
00:03:29.710,00:03:32.546,Sir.
00:03:47.602,00:03:50.105,Lean and hungry.
00:03:52.191,00:03:55.069,Still nothing ?
00:03:55.110,00:03:58.446,How long has he been gone ?
00:04:00.991,00:04:04.078,"Will they fight, sir ?"
00:04:04.119,00:04:06.788,"Soldier, I ordered you to move those catapults forward."
00:04:06.830,00:04:10.291,They're out of range.
00:04:10.333,00:04:13.921,The danger to the cavalry-- It is acceptable.
00:04:23.471,00:04:25.432,They say no.
00:04:34.233,00:04:37.194,Steady !
00:04:50.999,00:04:53.376,People should know when they're conquered.
00:05:04.138,00:05:08.349,"Would you, Quintus ?"
00:05:23.198,00:05:25.325,Strength and honor.
00:05:25.366,00:05:28.369,Strength and honor.
00:05:33.208,00:05:36.503,"At my signal, unleash hell."
00:05:59.067,00:06:02.237,Load the catapults.
00:06:02.279,00:06:04.781,Infantry form up for advance.
00:06:04.823,00:06:07.201,- Archers ready.
00:06:07.242,00:06:09.410,- Nock !
00:06:32.851,00:06:35.812,- Patres !
00:06:35.854,00:06:41.360,"Three weeks from now, I will be harvesting my crops."
00:06:41.400,00:06:45.989,"Imagine where you will be, and it will be so."
00:06:46.031,00:06:50.244,Hold the line !
00:06:50.285,00:07:00.254,"If you find yourself alone, riding in green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled."
00:07:00.295,00:07:04.049,"For you are in Elysium, and you're already dead !"
00:07:06.260,00:07:12.099,"Brothers, what we do in life..."
00:07:12.140,00:07:14.101,echoes in eternity.
00:07:20.982,00:07:23.610,- Pull !
00:07:31.076,00:07:34.371,Pull !
00:07:39.000,00:07:41.336,"Catapults ready, sir !"
00:07:51.972,00:07:54.182,"Archers, ignite !"
00:07:54.224,00:07:57.269,- Ignite !
00:08:02.690,00:08:05.652,"Archers, draw !"

00:09:19.976,00:09:22.937,Stay with me !
00:09:50.424,00:09:53.676,Roma Victor !
00:10:10.110,00:10:12.279,Aah !
00:10:21.329,00:10:23.998,Aah !

00:11:45.664,00:11:47.748,Aah !
00:12:26.454,00:12:28.540,Roma Victor !
00:13:10.498,00:13:13.543,Do you think he's really dying ?
00:13:14.335,00:13:16.129,He's been dying for ten years.
00:13:16.170,00:13:19.840,"If he weren't really dying, he wouldn't have sent for us."
00:13:20.675,00:13:22.677,Maybe he just misses us.
00:13:22.719,00:13:25.639,And the senators ?
00:13:22.719,00:13:27.474,"He wouldn't have summoned them if-- Peace, Commodus."
00:13:27.515,00:13:31.645,"After two weeks on the road, your incessant scheming is hurting my head."
00:13:37.525,00:13:39.653,He's made his decision.
00:13:39.694,00:13:42.530,He's going to announce it.
00:13:45.325,00:13:47.577,He will name me.
00:13:49.870,00:13:52.957,The first thing I shall do...
00:13:52.999,00:14:00.131,when-- is honor him with games worthy of His Majesty.
00:14:00.173,00:14:04.594,"For now, the first thing I shall do is have a bath."
00:14:04.636,00:14:08.598,Your Highness ?
00:14:10.099,00:14:13.894,"We seem to be almost there, sir."
00:14:19.400,00:14:22.111,Sire.
00:14:22.153,00:14:25.406,"He's at the front, sire."
00:14:25.448,00:14:28.368,The wounded are still coming in.
00:14:28.409,00:14:30.286,My horse.
00:14:30.328,00:14:32.664,My lord.
00:14:35.082,00:14:37.460,Kiss ?
00:15:11.661,00:15:13.621,You have proved your valor...
00:15:13.663,00:15:17.124,"yet again, Maximus."
00:15:18.042,00:15:20.837,Let us hope for the last time.
00:15:20.879,00:15:23.757,"There's no one left to fight, sire."
00:15:23.798,00:15:26.217,Ah. There is always someone left to fight.
00:15:26.259,00:15:29.679,How can I reward Rome's greatest general ?
00:15:34.726,00:15:37.437,Let me go home.
00:15:37.478,00:15:40.314,Ah. Home.
00:15:46.613,00:15:48.531,Whoa ! Whoa !
00:15:58.332,00:16:00.460,"They honor you, Caesar."
00:16:00.501,00:16:03.421,"It's for you, Maximus."
00:16:25.902,00:16:28.863,Have I missed it ?
00:16:28.905,00:16:31.699,You have missed the war.
00:16:31.741,00:16:33.993,"Father, congratulations."
00:16:34.034,00:16:37.246,I shall sacrifice a hundred bulls to honor your triumph.
00:16:37.288,00:16:39.081,Save the bulls.
00:16:39.123,00:16:41.501,Honor Maximus.
00:16:41.542,00:16:44.337,General.
00:16:44.378,00:16:48.842,"Rome salutes you, and I embrace you as a brother."
00:16:48.883,00:16:51.344,"It has been too long, my old friend."
00:16:51.385,00:16:53.513,Highness.
00:16:53.554,00:16:56.056,Take my arm.
00:16:56.891,00:17:00.186,I think it is time for me to leave.
00:17:14.617,00:17:18.329,So much for the glory of Rome.
00:17:38.808,00:17:41.101,Magnificent battle.
00:18:04.124,00:18:06.085,General.
00:18:06.126,00:18:09.213,Still alive.
00:18:09.255,00:18:12.008,The gods must love you.
00:18:12.050,00:18:14.719,"Back to barracks, General ?"
00:18:14.761,00:18:17.638,"Home. My wife, the son, the harvest."
00:18:17.680,00:18:22.018,Maximus the farmer.
00:18:22.060,00:18:25.772,"You know, dirt cleans off a lot easier than blood, Quintus."
00:18:25.813,00:18:27.941,Here he is.
00:18:27.982,00:18:29.943,"Senator Gaius, Senator Falco."
00:18:29.984,00:18:32.904,Beware of Gaius.
00:18:32.946,00:18:36.950,"and you'll wake up one day, and all you'll say is, Republic, republic, republic."
00:18:36.991,00:18:39.326,"Well, why not ?"
00:18:39.368,00:18:42.288,"Yes, and in a republic the senate has the power."
00:18:42.329,00:18:44.874,"But Senator Gaius isn't influenced by that, of course."
00:18:44.916,00:18:47.460,"Where do you stand, General ?"
00:18:47.501,00:18:52.632,"The soldier has the advantage of being able to look his enemy in the eye, Senator."
00:18:52.673,00:18:56.928,"Well, with an army behind you, you could be extremely political."
00:18:56.970,00:19:00.347,I warned you.
00:19:09.356,00:19:12.110,Maximus.
00:19:12.151,00:19:15.362,I'm going to need good men like you.
00:19:16.823,00:19:19.742,"How may I be of service, Highness ?"
00:19:19.784,00:19:22.495,You're a man who knows what it is to command.
00:19:22.536,00:19:26.124,"You give your orders, the orders are obeyed and the battle is won."
00:19:26.165,00:19:30.711,But these senators scheme and squabble and flatter and deceive.
00:19:30.753,00:19:34.381,"Maximus, we must save Rome from the politicians, my friend."
00:19:34.423,00:19:38.385,Can I count on you...
00:19:43.557,00:19:47.103,"Highness, when your father releases me, I intend to return home."
00:19:47.145,00:19:51.273,"Home ? Well, no one's earned it more."
00:19:51.315,00:19:55.862,Don't get too comfortable.
00:19:57.113,00:20:00.449,Lucilla's here.
00:20:00.491,00:20:03.202,She's not forgotten you.
00:20:03.243,00:20:05.997,And now you're the great man.
00:20:17.800,00:20:21.012,If only you had been born a man.
00:20:21.846,00:20:24.098,What a caesar you would have made.
00:20:25.766,00:20:28.019,Father.
00:20:33.024,00:20:35.068,You would have been strong.
00:20:35.109,00:20:38.196,"I wonder, would you have been just ?"
00:20:38.237,00:20:41.157,I would have been what you taught me to be.
00:20:41.199,00:20:43.534,Oh.
00:20:43.576,00:20:45.327,How was your journey ?
00:20:45.369,00:20:49.790,Long. Uncomfortable.
00:20:49.832,00:20:52.459,I need your help.
00:20:52.501,00:20:54.628,Of course.
00:20:54.670,00:20:56.964,He loves you.
00:20:57.798,00:21:00.760,And...
00:21:00.801,00:21:04.513,he will need you now more than ever.
00:21:08.684,00:21:10.937,Enough of politics.
00:21:10.978,00:21:15.274,Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter...
00:21:15.315,00:21:17.610,and I am a good father.
00:21:22.531,00:21:26.493,"This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it ?"
00:21:38.256,00:21:40.591,Good morning.
00:21:52.519,00:21:56.065,I need three more horses.
00:22:05.199,00:22:07.743,Two ! Three !
00:22:07.785,00:22:09.787,Four !
00:22:09.829,00:22:12.539,One ! Two !
00:22:28.055,00:22:31.309,"You sent for me, Caesar ?"
00:22:33.435,00:22:35.229,Caesar ?
00:22:35.271,00:22:38.858,"Tell me again, Maximus."
00:22:38.899,00:22:41.819,Why are we here ?
00:22:41.861,00:22:44.864,"For the glory of the Empire, sire."
00:22:44.905,00:22:47.158,"Ah, yes."
00:22:47.908,00:22:50.577,"Ah, yes, I remember."
00:22:52.746,00:22:55.208,"Do you see that map, Maximus ?"
00:22:55.249,00:22:59.545,That is the world which I created.
00:22:59.586,00:23:01.714,For 25 years...
00:23:01.755,00:23:06.593,"I have conquered, spilt blood, expanded the Empire."
00:23:06.635,00:23:10.806,"Since I became caesar, I've known four years without war."
00:23:10.848,00:23:13.100,Four years of peace in 20.
00:23:13.142,00:23:15.895,And for what ?
00:23:22.400,00:23:26.072,I brought the sword.
00:23:26.113,00:23:31.994,"Caesar, your life-- Please."
00:23:32.036,00:23:34.914,Come.
00:23:34.955,00:23:36.999,Come sit.
00:23:37.041,00:23:43.130,Let us talk together now-- very simply-- as men.
00:23:44.340,00:23:48.426,Maximus...
00:23:51.638,00:23:54.474,Five thousand of my men are out there in the freezing mud.
00:23:54.516,00:23:57.061,Three thousand of them are bloodied and cleaved.
00:23:57.103,00:23:59.272,Two thousand will never leave this place.
00:23:59.313,00:24:01.941,I will not believe that they fought and died for nothing.
00:24:01.982,00:24:03.650,"And what would you believe, Maximus ?"
00:24:03.692,00:24:07.113,They fought for you...
00:24:07.154,00:24:11.117,"And what is Rome, Maximus ?"
00:24:11.158,00:24:13.451,I've seen much of the rest of the world.
00:24:13.493,00:24:17.497,It is brutal and cruel and dark.
00:24:17.539,00:24:19.625,Yet you have never been there.
00:24:19.666,00:24:22.253,You have not seen what it has become.
00:24:22.295,00:24:25.256,"I am dying, Maximus."
00:24:25.298,00:24:30.803,"When a man sees his end, he wants to know there was some purpose to his life."
00:24:30.844,00:24:34.556,How will the world speak my name in years to come ?
00:24:34.598,00:24:37.101,Will I be known as the philosopher ?
00:24:37.143,00:24:41.688,The warrior ?
00:24:41.730,00:24:46.484,Or will I be the emperor who gave Rome back her true self ?
00:24:46.526,00:24:49.529,There was once a dream that was Rome.
00:24:49.571,00:24:52.699,You could only whisper it.
00:24:52.741,00:24:55.995,Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish.
00:24:56.036,00:24:58.164,It was so fragile.
00:24:58.205,00:25:02.251,And I fear that it will not survive the winter.
00:25:03.543,00:25:11.135,"Maximus, let us whisper now, together, you and I."
00:25:11.177,00:25:13.929,You have a son.
00:25:13.971,00:25:16.890,Tell me about your home.
00:25:22.480,00:25:27.734,My house is in the hills above Tiujillo.
00:25:28.777,00:25:31.780,Pink stones that warm in the sun.
00:25:31.822,00:25:38.412,"A kitchen garden that smells of herbs in the day, jasmine in the evening."
00:25:39.537,00:25:42.749,Through the gate is a giant poplar.
00:25:42.791,00:25:45.461,"Figs, apples, pears."
00:25:45.503,00:25:47.463,"The soil, Marcus-- black."
00:25:47.505,00:25:50.383,- Black like my wife's hair.
00:25:50.424,00:25:52.718,"Grapes on the south slopes, olives on the north."
00:25:52.759,00:25:55.221,Wild ponies play near my house.
00:25:55.262,00:25:58.349,- He wants to be one of them.
00:25:58.391,00:26:02.228,"Two years, 264 days, and this morning."
00:26:03.270,00:26:05.605,"I envy you, Maximus."
00:26:05.647,00:26:09.735,It's a good home.
00:26:11.487,00:26:15.449,There is one more duty...
00:26:15.491,00:26:19.286,that I ask of you before you go home.
00:26:20.204,00:26:22.415,"What would you have me do, Caesar ?"
00:26:22.456,00:26:26.335,I want you to become the protector of Rome after I die.
00:26:27.294,00:26:30.339,I will empower you to one end alone.
00:26:30.381,00:26:34.592,To give power back to the people of Rome...
00:26:34.634,00:26:38.305,and end the corruption that has crippled it.
00:26:43.894,00:26:47.731,Will you accept this great honor that I have offered you ?
00:26:49.233,00:26:52.528,"With all my heart, no."
00:26:53.653,00:26:58.658,"Maximus, that is why it must be you."
00:26:58.700,00:27:03.621,"But surely a prefect, a senator, somebody who knows the city, who understands her politics."
00:27:03.663,00:27:07.000,But you have not been corrupted by her politics.
00:27:11.713,00:27:15.968,- And Commodus ?
00:27:16.009,00:27:18.429,You have known that since you were young.
00:27:18.471,00:27:21.098,Commodus cannot rule.
00:27:21.140,00:27:23.683,He must not rule.
00:27:24.684,00:27:27.771,You are the son that I should have had.
00:27:30.190,00:27:33.902,Commodus will accept my decision.
00:27:35.488,00:27:40.534,He knows that you command the loyalty of the army.
00:27:43.703,00:27:47.040,"I-- I need some time, sire."
00:27:47.082,00:27:48.834,Yes.
00:27:48.875,00:27:53.130,"By sunset, I hope you will have agreed."
00:27:53.172,00:27:56.425,Now embrace me as my son.
00:27:58.676,00:28:01.763,And bring an old man another blanket.
00:28:16.903,00:28:19.615,My father favors you now.
00:28:19.657,00:28:22.117,It was not always so.
00:28:22.159,00:28:24.370,Many things change.
00:28:24.411,00:28:27.581,Many things.
00:28:29.958,00:28:32.378,"Maximus, stop."
00:28:35.297,00:28:38.300,Let me see your face.
00:28:38.342,00:28:41.220,Hmm.
00:28:41.261,00:28:43.389,I lost many men.
00:28:43.430,00:28:46.058,What did my father want with you ?
00:28:46.099,00:28:49.769,To wish me well before I leave for home.
00:28:49.811,00:28:55.484,You're lying. I could always tell when you were lying because you were never any good at it.
00:28:55.526,00:28:58.237,I never acquired your comfort with it.
00:28:58.278,00:29:00.739,But then you never had to.
00:29:00.780,00:29:03.909,Life is more simple for a soldier.
00:29:05.452,00:29:08.622,Or do you think me heartless ?
00:29:08.664,00:29:12.000,I think you have a talent for survival.
00:29:17.464,00:29:20.467,"Maximus, stop."
00:29:20.509,00:29:23.429,Is it really so terrible seeing me again ?
00:29:23.470,00:29:27.057,No. I'm tired from battle.
00:29:27.099,00:29:30.477,It hurts you to see my father so fragile.
00:29:33.063,00:29:37.150,Commodus expects that my father will announce his succession within days.
00:29:38.736,00:29:42.615,Will you serve my brother as you served his father ?
00:29:44.324,00:29:47.077,I will always serve Rome.
00:29:48.370,00:29:53.083,"Do you know, I still remember you in my prayers."
00:29:54.000,00:29:58.046,"Oh, yes."
00:30:01.174,00:30:04.678,I was sad to hear of your husband's death.
00:30:06.472,00:30:09.683,Thank you.
00:30:11.143,00:30:14.480,Yes. Lucius.
00:30:14.521,00:30:16.732,He'll be nearly eight years old.
00:30:16.774,00:30:19.777,My son is also nearly eight.
00:30:21.945,00:30:24.573,I thank you for your prayers.
00:30:31.871,00:30:35.584,"Ancestors, I ask for your guidance."
00:30:35.626,00:30:40.380,"Blessed mother, come to me with the gods' desire for my future."
00:30:40.422,00:30:44.760,"Blessed father, watch over my wife and son with a ready sword."
00:30:46.052,00:30:49.848,Whisper to them I live only to hold them again.
00:30:49.889,00:30:53.352,"Ancestors, I honor you..."
00:30:53.393,00:30:57.230,and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me.
00:31:19.002,00:31:21.087,Cicero.
00:31:24.424,00:31:27.260,Sir.
00:31:30.138,00:31:33.225,You don't find it hard to do your duty ?
00:31:36.395,00:31:39.606,Sometimes I do what I want to do.
00:31:39.648,00:31:42.776,The rest of the time I do what I have to.
00:31:45.153,00:31:48.615,We may not be able to go home after all.
00:32:17.686,00:32:21.231,Are you ready to do your duty for Rome ?
00:32:23.983,00:32:26.319,"Yes, Father."
00:32:26.361,00:32:28.655,You will not be emperor.
00:32:30.990,00:32:33.952,"Which wiser, older man is to take my place ?"
00:32:33.993,00:32:37.456,My powers will pass to Maximus...
00:32:37.497,00:32:39.666,to hold in trust...
00:32:39.708,00:32:44.421,until the Senate is ready to rule once more.
00:32:44.463,00:32:49.384,Rome is to be a republic again.
00:32:50.510,00:32:53.972,Maximus.
00:32:58.685,00:33:01.354,My decision disappoints you ?
00:33:04.942,00:33:12.783,"You wrote to me once, listing the four chief virtues."
00:33:12.825,00:33:19.748,"Wisdom, justice, fortitude and temperance."
00:33:21.834,00:33:25.838,"As I read the list, I knew I had none of them."
00:33:25.879,00:33:29.591,"But I have other virtues, Father."
00:33:29.633,00:33:32.093,Ambition.
00:33:32.135,00:33:35.430,That can be a virtue when it drives us to excel.
00:33:36.556,00:33:39.893,Resourcefulness.
00:33:39.935,00:33:43.104,"Perhaps not on the battlefield, but..."
00:33:43.146,00:33:46.608,there are many forms of courage.
00:33:46.650,00:33:50.069,Devotion-- to my family...
00:33:50.111,00:33:52.614,and to you.
00:33:52.656,00:33:57.452,But none of my virtues were on your list.
00:33:58.871,00:34:01.707,Even then it was as if you didn't want me for your son.
00:34:01.748,00:34:04.376,"Oh, Commodus."
00:34:04.417,00:34:06.962,You go too far.
00:34:07.004,00:34:10.716,I search the faces of the gods...
00:34:10.757,00:34:15.554,"for ways to please you, to make you proud."
00:34:15.595,00:34:20.266,"One kind word, one full hug..."
00:34:20.308,00:34:28.734,"where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight, would have been like the sun on my heart for a thousand years."
00:34:31.319,00:34:35.032,What is it in me you hate so much ?
00:34:36.616,00:34:38.827,All I've ever wanted...
00:34:38.869,00:34:43.790,"was to live up to you, Caesar."
00:34:44.499,00:34:46.501,Father.
00:34:46.543,00:34:49.337,Commodus.
00:34:51.506,00:34:54.593,Your faults as a son...
00:34:54.634,00:34:58.889,is my failure as a father.
00:35:08.648,00:35:11.526,Come.
00:35:13.737,00:35:16.406,Father.
00:35:30.587,00:35:33.673,I would butcher the whole world...
00:35:33.715,00:35:36.843,if you would only love me !
00:36:13.379,00:36:18.010,"Maximus, the Emperor needs you."
00:36:22.263,00:36:27.019,"Lament with me, brother."
00:36:53.920,00:36:56.548,How did he die ?
00:36:56.589,00:36:59.384,The surgeons say there was no pain.
00:36:59.425,00:37:02.095,His breath gave out as he slept.
00:37:10.937,00:37:13.148,Father.
00:37:15.108,00:37:18.111,"Your emperor asks for your loyalty, Maximus."
00:37:19.529,00:37:22.240,Take my hand.
00:37:23.783,00:37:26.953,I only offer it once.
00:37:39.799,00:37:42.135,Quintus.
00:38:31.434,00:38:33.519,"Hail, Caesar."
00:38:33.561,00:38:36.314,I must go to the senators.
00:38:36.355,00:38:39.067,Wake Gaius and Falco.
00:38:39.109,00:38:41.611,Sword.
00:38:42.821,00:38:46.324,"Maximus, please be careful."
00:38:46.365,00:38:49.535,Prudent ?
00:38:49.577,00:38:53.039,The Emperor died of natural causes.
00:38:53.081,00:38:56.501,"Why are you armed, Quintus ?"
00:38:59.296,00:39:02.048,"Please don't fight, Maximus."
00:39:03.633,00:39:06.011,I'm sorry.
00:39:06.052,00:39:10.765,Ride until dawn...
00:39:10.807,00:39:13.143,"Quintus, look at me."
00:39:13.185,00:39:16.562,Promise me that you will look after my family.
00:39:17.647,00:39:20.066,Your family will meet you in the afterlife.
00:39:20.108,00:39:22.485,- No !
00:39:45.591,00:39:48.303,Kneel.
00:39:49.804,00:39:52.307,"Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son."
00:39:52.349,00:39:56.353,Whisper to them that I live only to hold them again.
00:39:57.937,00:40:00.648,At least give me a clean death.
00:40:02.025,00:40:04.277,A soldier's death.
00:40:25.173,00:40:29.135,"The frost, sometimes it makes the blade stick."
00:40:49.281,00:40:51.532,Praetorian !
00:40:52.617,00:40:55.370,Hyah ! Hyah !
00:42:09.568,00:42:12.530,When was the last time you were home ?
00:42:12.571,00:42:17.035,"Two years, 264 days, and this morning."
00:42:17.076,00:42:21.580,"Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son with a ready sword."
00:42:21.622,00:42:24.876,Whisper to them I live only to hold them again.
00:42:24.917,00:42:28.754,"For all else is dust and air, and I live only to hold them again."
00:42:29.922,00:42:32.967,For all else is dust and air.
00:43:09.670,00:43:13.550,"- Mama, il soldati !"
00:43:31.734,00:43:34.446,Papa ! Papa !
00:43:39.325,00:43:42.287,Hyah ! Hyah !
00:46:18.484,00:46:21.862,- Don't die.
00:46:25.824,00:46:29.036,You'll meet them again.
00:46:29.078,00:46:32.164,- Not yet.
00:46:39.589,00:46:44.510,No !
00:47:18.002,00:47:19.878,Don't die.
00:47:19.920,00:47:22.381,They'll feed you to the lions.
00:47:22.423,00:47:24.759,They are worth more than we are.
00:47:35.227,00:47:37.271,Better now ?
00:47:37.313,00:47:39.023,Clean.
00:48:09.762,00:48:11.972,Proximo !
00:48:12.014,00:48:14.183,My old friend.
00:48:14.225,00:48:17.562,Every day is a great day when you are here.
00:48:17.603,00:48:22.483,Today...
00:48:24.777,00:48:27.363,Those giraffes you sold me...
00:48:27.405,00:48:29.198,they won't mate.
00:48:29.240,00:48:33.910,They just walk around eating and not mating.
00:48:33.952,00:48:37.248,You sold me...
00:48:37.289,00:48:42.127,I want my money back.
00:48:43.671,00:48:47.924,- I do special price for you.
00:48:49.176,00:48:52.221,Have you seen my new stock ?
00:49:06.026,00:49:08.863,Do any of them fight ?
00:49:08.905,00:49:11.699,"Some are good for fighting, others for dying."
00:49:11.741,00:49:13.950,"You need both, I think."
00:49:13.992,00:49:16.120,Get up !
00:49:23.043,00:49:27.005,What's your trade ?
00:49:27.047,00:49:31.218,"Oh, no. I bought him from a salt mine in Carthage."
00:49:31.260,00:49:33.846,Sit down !
00:49:37.266,00:49:39.226,Mark of the legion.
00:49:39.268,00:49:42.605,Deserter.
00:49:42.647,00:49:44.732,He's a Spaniard.
00:49:44.774,00:49:46.776,"for 1,000."
00:49:46.818,00:49:48.985,"The Numidian alone is worth 2,000 !"
00:49:49.027,00:49:51.823,These slaves are rotten.
00:49:51.864,00:49:54.408,It all adds to the flavor.
00:49:54.450,00:49:58.036,Wait !
00:49:58.078,00:50:02.667,"I'll give you 2,000..."
00:50:02.708,00:50:06.337,"That's 5,000 for an old friend."
00:50:22.060,00:50:24.856,Come on !
00:50:24.897,00:50:27.775,I am Proximo !
00:50:27.817,00:50:34.323,"I shall be closer to you for the next few days, which will be last of your miserable lives, than that bitch of a mother..."
00:50:34.365,00:50:37.326,that brought you screaming into this world !
00:50:37.368,00:50:41.330,I did not pay good money for you for your company !
00:50:41.372,00:50:46.752,- I paid it so that I could profit from your death.
00:50:46.794,00:50:53.968,"And as your mother was there at your beginning, so I shall be there at your end."
00:50:54.010,00:51:11.027,"- And when you die, and die you shall, your transition shall be to the sound of-- Gladiators, I salute you."
00:51:14.780,00:51:17.700,Red !
00:51:17.742,00:51:22.204,Yellow !
00:51:22.246,00:51:24.957,Yellow.
00:51:33.131,00:51:34.299,Hyah !
00:51:34.341,00:51:36.594,Good.
00:51:36.635,00:51:38.387,Red.
00:51:42.808,00:51:45.101,Spaniard !
00:52:09.460,00:52:12.463,- Uhh.
00:52:17.843,00:52:20.512,That's enough for the moment !
00:52:20.554,00:52:23.307,His time will come.
00:52:24.016,00:52:26.518,Next !
00:52:39.573,00:52:43.828,"Spaniard, why don't you fight ?"
00:52:43.869,00:52:46.914,We all have to fight.
00:52:59.885,00:53:02.220,Is that the sign of your gods ?
00:53:07.059,00:53:10.479,Will that not anger them ?
00:53:30.875,00:53:32.877,The gods favor you.
00:53:32.918,00:53:35.880,Red is the gods' color.
00:53:35.921,00:53:39.550,You will need their help today.
00:53:55.816,00:53:59.737,Some of you are thinking you won't fight.
00:53:59.778,00:54:02.364,Some that you can't fight.
00:54:03.448,00:54:07.953,"They all say that, until they're out there."
00:54:09.287,00:54:12.332,Listen.
00:54:12.374,00:54:15.335,Kill. Kill. Kill.
00:54:20.549,00:54:26.262,"Thrust this into another man's flesh, and then they will applaud and love you for that."
00:54:26.304,00:54:31.936,You-- You may begin to love them...
00:54:31.977,00:54:35.147,for that.
00:54:38.109,00:54:42.571,"Ultimately, we're all dead men."
00:54:43.989,00:54:47.826,"Sadly, we cannot choose how, but..."
00:54:47.868,00:54:51.371,we can decide how we meet that end...
00:54:51.413,00:54:55.542,in order that we are remembered...
00:54:55.584,00:54:57.544,as men.
00:55:01.840,00:55:04.468,"On the left, draw your shields !"
00:55:04.509,00:55:07.138,"On the right, draw your swords !"
00:55:07.179,00:55:14.979,Kill. Kill-- Pair them up-- red with yellow.
00:55:18.023,00:55:19.650,Next !
00:55:22.945,00:55:24.613,Next !
00:57:18.310,00:57:21.146,Hyah ! Hyah !
00:59:07.585,00:59:10.672,- Go away !
00:59:40.452,00:59:43.580,He enters Rome like a conquering hero.
00:59:43.621,00:59:45.582,But what has he conquered ?
00:59:45.623,00:59:48.710,"Give him time, Gracchus."
00:59:48.752,00:59:50.921,I think he could do very well.
00:59:50.962,00:59:53.006,For Rome or for you ?
00:59:58.678,01:00:01.932,"Go to your mother, Lucius."
01:00:08.272,01:00:12.359,Lucius !
01:00:13.110,01:00:17.489,"Hail, Caesar."
01:00:19.991,01:00:22.786,Rome greets her new emperor.
01:00:22.827,01:00:26.373,"Your loyal subjects bid you welcome, Highness."
01:00:26.415,01:00:29.751,"Thank you, Falco."
01:00:26.415,01:00:33.422,"And for the loyal subjects, I trust they weren't too expensive."
01:00:33.464,01:00:37.092,Gracchus.
01:00:37.134,01:00:40.304,There are many matters that require your attention.
01:00:43.014,01:00:46.059,To order ! To order !
01:00:46.101,01:00:50.897,"For your guidance, Caesar, the Senate has prepared a series of protocols..."
01:00:50.939,01:00:54.568,to begin addressing the many problems in the city.
01:00:54.610,01:00:58.780,Beginning with basic sanitation for the Greek quarter...
01:00:58.822,01:01:02.159,to combat the plague which is already springing up there.
01:01:02.200,01:01:05.870,"So, if Caesar-- Shh."
01:01:06.704,01:01:09.749,"Don't you see, Gracchus ?"
01:01:09.791,01:01:11.960,"That's the very problem, isn't it ?"
01:01:12.002,01:01:15.672,My father spent all his time at study...
01:01:16.965,01:01:20.718,of books and learning and philosophy.
01:01:20.760,01:01:25.974,He spent his twilight hours reading scrolls from the Senate.
01:01:26.016,01:01:31.855,"And all the while, the people have forgotten-- But the Senate is the People, sire."
01:01:31.896,01:01:35.733,Chosen from among the people...
01:01:35.775,01:01:40.238,"I doubt that many of the people eat so well as you do, Gracchus."
01:01:40.280,01:01:45.577,"Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius. I think I understand my own people."
01:01:45.619,01:01:49.498,"Then, perhaps Caesar will be so good as to teach us..."
01:01:49.540,01:01:51.916,out of his own extensive experience.
01:01:55.504,01:01:57.381,I call it love.
01:01:57.422,01:02:01.134,I am their father.
01:02:01.176,01:02:03.887,And I shall hold them to my bosom and embrace them tightly.
01:02:03.928,01:02:06.848,"Have you ever embraced someone dying of plague, sire ?"
01:02:13.230,01:02:18.902,"No, but if you interrupt me again, I assure you that you shall."
01:02:18.943,01:02:22.072,"Senator, my brother is very tired."
01:02:22.113,01:02:24.616,Leave your list with me.
01:02:24.658,01:02:27.244,Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.
01:02:27.285,01:02:32.749,"My lady, as always, your lightest touch commands obedience."
01:02:39.005,01:02:41.883,Who are they to lecture me ?
01:02:41.925,01:02:44.595,"Commodus, the Senate has its uses."
01:02:44.636,01:02:47.764,What uses ?
01:02:48.806,01:02:51.768,It should be just...
01:02:51.809,01:02:54.521,and Rome.
01:02:54.563,01:02:56.940,There's always been a Senate.
01:02:56.981,01:03:01.236,Rome has changed.
01:03:01.278,01:03:04.406,to rule an empire.
01:03:01.278,01:03:07.158,"Of course, but leave the people their-- Illusions."
01:03:07.200,01:03:09.411,Traditions.
01:03:09.453,01:03:15.292,"My father's war against the barbarians-- He said it himself, it achieved nothing."
01:03:15.333,01:03:18.629,But the people loved him.
01:03:18.670,01:03:23.383,Why ?
01:03:23.425,01:03:27.679,What do they care about Germania ?
01:03:27.721,01:03:31.642,The greatness of Rome.
01:03:31.683,01:03:34.811,"Well, what is that ?"
01:03:36.187,01:03:40.692,It's an idea-- greatness.
01:03:43.194,01:03:47.907,Greatness is a vision.
01:03:48.700,01:03:52.162,"Do you not see, Lucilla ?"
01:03:52.203,01:03:56.958,"I will give the people a vision of Rome, and they'll love me for it."
01:03:57.000,01:04:01.963,"And they'll soon forget the tedious sermonizing of a few dry, old men."
01:04:13.057,01:04:16.812,I will give the people the greatest vision of their lives.
01:05:05.861,01:05:10.699,vino ! White and and red wine for your drinking pleasure !
01:05:12.283,01:05:18.498,"Vino, vino, vino !"
01:05:18.540,01:05:20.792,Games.
01:05:22.335,01:05:25.046,150 days of games.
01:05:25.088,01:05:28.800,He's cleverer than I thought.
01:05:28.842,01:05:31.595,The whole of Rome would be laughing at him...
01:05:31.636,01:05:34.222,if they weren't so afraid of his Praetorians.
01:05:34.264,01:05:37.809,Fear and wonder-- a powerful combination.
01:05:37.851,01:05:40.687,You really think the people are going to be seduced by that ?
01:05:40.729,01:05:45.024,I think he knows what Rome is.
01:05:45.066,01:05:48.361,"Conjure magic for them, and they'll be distracted."
01:05:48.403,01:05:52.616,Take away their freedom and still they'll roar.
01:05:52.657,01:05:55.368,The beating heart of Rome...
01:05:55.410,01:05:57.579,is not the marble of the Senate.
01:05:57.621,01:06:00.290,It's the sand of the Colosseum.
01:06:01.249,01:06:07.756,"He'll bring them death, and they will love him for it."
01:06:11.676,01:06:16.556,Spaniard ! Spaniard !
01:06:29.152,01:06:31.321,Spaniard.
01:06:31.362,01:06:33.657,Spain.
01:06:33.698,01:06:37.243,Spaniard.
01:06:38.662,01:06:40.956,Guard !
01:07:43.727,01:07:46.563,Are you not entertained ?
01:07:46.604,01:07:49.148,Are you not entertained ?
01:07:51.484,01:07:54.362,Is this not why you are here ?
01:07:58.324,01:08:02.078,Spaniard ! Spaniard !
01:08:02.119,01:08:06.583,Spaniard ! Spaniard !
01:08:09.044,01:08:11.421,Spaniard !
01:08:11.462,01:08:15.633,Spaniard ! Spaniard !
01:08:17.928,01:08:21.056,What do you want ?
01:08:21.097,01:08:23.058,Huh ?
01:08:23.099,01:08:25.060,Girl ?
01:08:25.101,01:08:26.853,Boy ?
01:08:26.895,01:08:29.940,- You sent for me ?
01:08:29.981,01:08:33.234,"You're good, Spaniard, but you're not that good."
01:08:33.276,01:08:37.238,You could be magnificent.
01:08:37.280,01:08:38.949,That is enough.
01:08:38.990,01:08:42.869,"That's enough for the provinces, but not for Rome."
01:08:44.871,01:08:47.164,The young emperor...
01:08:47.206,01:08:50.209,has arranged a series of spectacles...
01:08:50.251,01:08:54.798,"to commemorate his father, Marcus Aurelius."
01:08:54.839,01:08:56.841,I find that amusing...
01:08:56.883,01:09:04.265,"since it was Marcus Aurelius-- the wise, the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius-- that closed us down."
01:09:06.434,01:09:10.647,"So, finally, after five years of scratching a living..."
01:09:10.688,01:09:18.571,"in flea-infested villages, we're finally going back to where we belong-- the Colosseum."
01:09:18.613,01:09:23.534,"Oh, you should see the Colosseum, Spaniard."
01:09:24.619,01:09:27.831,Fifty-thousand Romans...
01:09:27.872,01:09:31.918,watching...
01:09:27.872,01:09:35.546,"every movement of your sword, willing you to make that killer blow."
01:09:36.840,01:09:39.134,The silence before you strike...
01:09:39.175,01:09:48.434,"and the noise afterwards, it rises-- it rises up like-- like th-- like-- like a storm..."
01:09:48.476,01:09:50.687,as if you were the thunder god himself.
01:09:50.728,01:09:55.066,You were a gladiator ?
01:10:00.905,01:10:02.740,You won your freedom ?
01:10:02.782,01:10:06.536,"A long time ago, the emperor..."
01:10:06.577,01:10:09.039,presented me with a rudius.
01:10:09.080,01:10:12.291,It's just a wooden sword.
01:10:13.376,01:10:17.547,The symbol of your freedom.
01:10:13.376,01:10:22.218,"He-- He touched me on the shoulder, and I was free."
01:10:22.259,01:10:26.097,You knew Marcus Aurelius ?
01:10:26.139,01:10:28.892,I said he touched me on the shoulder once.
01:10:29.851,01:10:33.146,You asked me what I want.
01:10:33.188,01:10:36.232,"I, too, want to stand in front of the emperor..."
01:10:37.316,01:10:39.069,as you did.
01:10:39.110,01:10:42.989,"Then, listen to me."
01:10:43.031,01:10:47.202,I wasn't the best because I killed quickly.
01:10:47.243,01:10:50.914,I was the best because the crowd loved me.
01:10:50.955,01:10:56.377,"Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom."
01:10:58.880,01:11:01.465,I will win the crowd.
01:11:02.800,01:11:07.263,I will give them something they have never seen before.
01:11:07.304,01:11:11.142,"So, Spaniard, we shall go to Rome together..."
01:11:11.184,01:11:13.186,and have bloody adventures !
01:11:13.228,01:11:15.479,And the great whore will suckle us until we are...
01:11:15.521,01:11:17.774,fat and happy and can suckle no more.
01:11:17.815,01:11:26.407,"And then, when enough men have died, perhaps you will have your freedom."
01:11:31.662,01:11:34.665,Here.
01:11:56.353,01:12:03.653,"It's somewhere out there-- my country, my home."
01:12:03.694,01:12:07.323,My wife is preparing food.
01:12:07.364,01:12:10.910,My daughters carry water from the river.
01:12:10.952,01:12:13.412,Will I ever see them again ?
01:12:13.454,01:12:15.331,I think no.
01:12:15.372,01:12:18.542,Do you believe you'll see them again when you die ?
01:12:18.584,01:12:21.004,I think so.
01:12:21.045,01:12:25.382,"But then, I will die soon."
01:12:25.424,01:12:27.718,They will not die for many years.
01:12:29.053,01:12:33.390,I'll have to wait.
01:12:33.432,01:12:37.020,Of course.
01:12:37.061,01:12:44.235,"You see, my wife..."
01:12:44.277,01:12:46.321,are already waiting for me.
01:12:46.362,01:12:48.990,You'll meet them again.
01:12:49.032,01:12:52.451,But not yet.
01:12:55.038,01:12:58.415,Not yet.
01:12:55.038,01:13:00.543,Unless-- Not yet.
01:13:03.462,01:13:05.882,Not yet.
01:14:07.944,01:14:10.780,Out !
01:14:10.821,01:14:14.284,"Go, go. Out !"
01:14:25.044,01:14:27.504,"Good to see you again, old friend."
01:14:32.385,01:14:34.678,Bring me fortune.
01:14:39.183,01:14:42.019,Have you ever seen anything like that before ?
01:14:42.061,01:14:46.732,I didn't know men could build such things.
01:14:55.783,01:14:57.493,Win the crowd.
01:14:57.534,01:15:01.622,Get Inside ! Move. Inside.
01:15:50.587,01:15:53.966,He sleeps so well because he's loved.
01:15:56.219,01:16:00.639,"Come, brother."
01:16:01.807,01:16:05.395,I will make Rome the wonder of the ages.
01:16:07.104,01:16:10.316,That is what Gracchus and his friends don't understand.
01:16:10.358,01:16:15.612,All my desires are splitting my head to pieces.
01:16:21.577,01:16:24.663,"Commodus, drink this tonic."
01:16:33.297,01:16:36.509,I think the time is almost right.
01:16:36.551,01:16:39.429,I could announce the dissolution of the Senate...
01:16:39.470,01:16:41.431,at the celebration to honor our father.
01:16:41.472,01:16:44.808,You think I should ?
01:16:44.850,01:16:46.936,Are the people ready ?
01:16:48.271,01:16:50.565,I think you need your rest now.
01:16:56.695,01:17:00.824,- Will you stay with me ?
01:17:08.082,01:17:13.837,Still.
01:17:13.879,01:17:17.341,- Stay with me tonight ?
01:17:21.011,01:17:23.055,"Then, kiss me."
01:17:32.022,01:17:34.900,"Sleep, brother."
01:17:52.209,01:17:54.837,Come on now.
01:17:59.300,01:18:02.178,I want you.
01:17:59.300,01:18:04.721,"I want you so-- All right, Let him pass !"
01:18:20.530,01:18:22.865,Sixty !
01:18:22.906,01:18:26.327,500 !
01:18:26.369,01:18:29.955,"The emperor wants battles, and I don't want to sacrifice my best fighters."
01:18:29.997,01:18:33.501,"The crowd wants battles, so the emperor gives them battles."
01:18:33.543,01:18:35.711,And you get the battle of Carthage.
01:18:35.752,01:18:38.964,The massacre of Carthage.
01:18:39.006,01:18:42.843,"Oh, why don't you go down to the prison and round up all the beggars and thieves."
01:18:42.885,01:18:44.637,We've done that.
01:18:44.679,01:18:50.059,"If you want to give away the best gladiators in the whole of the empire, I want double the rates."
01:18:50.100,01:18:53.896,"You'll get your contract rates, or you'll get your contract cancelled."
01:18:53.937,01:18:55.690,You don't like it ?
01:18:55.731,01:19:01.070,Then you can crawl back down that shithole that you came from.
01:19:01.111,01:19:04.699,"Please, Cassius !"
01:19:34.604,01:19:37.273,"Gladiator, are you the one they call the Spaniard ?"
01:19:37.314,01:19:41.193,Yes.
01:19:41.235,01:19:44.821,They said you could crush a man's skull with one hand.
01:19:44.863,01:19:47.991,A man's ? No.
01:19:48.033,01:19:49.159,A boy's.
01:19:52.079,01:19:55.791,They have good horses in Spain ?
01:19:55.832,01:20:00.379,"This is Argento, and this is Scarto."
01:20:00.421,01:20:03.466,They were my horses.
01:20:03.507,01:20:07.970,They were taken from me.
01:20:08.011,01:20:10.389,I shall cheer for you.
01:20:10.431,01:20:14.477,My uncle says it makes me strong.
01:20:14.518,01:20:16.771,My father's dead.
01:20:18.147,01:20:21.567,"Master Lucius, it is time."
01:20:21.609,01:20:25.655,I have to go.
01:20:26.863,01:20:29.700,"Lucius Verus, after my father."
01:20:59.396,01:21:01.940,Lower !
01:21:06.236,01:21:10.825,More shields !
01:21:30.720,01:21:38.894,"When the emperor enters, raise your weapons, salute him and then speak together !"
01:21:38.935,01:21:43.232,Face the emperor and don't turn your back on him !
01:21:43.273,01:21:47.110,"Go, and die with honor !"
01:22:41.540,01:22:44.126,"Hail, mighty Caesar !"
01:22:44.167,01:22:48.297,Caesar ! Caesar ! Caesar !
01:22:48.338,01:22:50.758,Caesar !
01:22:54.010,01:22:57.139,"And we who are about to die, salute you !"
01:22:57.890,01:23:04.980,"On this day, we reach back to hallowed antiquity..."
01:23:05.021,01:23:08.567,to bring you a recreation of the second fall...
01:23:08.609,01:23:10.653,of mighty Carthage !
01:23:14.740,01:23:22.998,"On the barren plain of Zama, there stood the invincible armies..."
01:23:23.039,01:23:26.168,"of the barbarian, Hannibal."
01:23:26.209,01:23:29.505,Ferocious mercenaries and warriors...
01:23:29.546,01:23:32.257,from all brute nations...
01:23:32.299,01:23:35.469,bent on merciless...
01:23:35.511,01:23:39.097,"destruction, conquest."
01:23:39.139,01:23:43.477,Your emperor is pleased to give you...
01:23:43.519,01:23:46.313,the barbarian horde !
01:23:54.905,01:23:58.158,Anyone here been in the army ?
01:23:58.200,01:24:00.536,I served with you at Vindobona.
01:24:00.577,01:24:03.497,You can help me.
01:24:03.539,01:24:10.253,"Whatever comes out of these gates, we've got a better chance of survival if we work together."
01:24:11.421,01:24:13.883,Do you understand ?
01:24:14.675,01:24:17.260,"If we stay together, we survive."
01:24:17.302,01:24:20.014,I'm pleased to bring you the legionnaires...
01:24:20.055,01:24:24.768,of Scipio Africanus !
01:24:35.362,01:24:38.114,To the death !
01:24:39.950,01:24:45.205,Kill ! Kill !
01:24:46.790,01:24:48.792,Stay close !
01:24:54.297,01:24:56.550,Come together !
01:24:56.592,01:24:59.261,- Staggered columns !
01:24:59.302,01:25:01.805,Staggered columns !
01:25:13.191,01:25:15.193,Soon all your men will be slain.
01:25:15.235,01:25:17.487,You don't have a chance !
01:25:28.040,01:25:30.084,Lock your shields !
01:25:30.125,01:25:32.086,As one !
01:25:32.127,01:25:33.963,Hold !
01:25:35.714,01:25:37.173,Hold !
01:25:37.215,01:25:39.843,- As one !
01:25:41.804,01:25:43.847,Well done !
01:25:46.600,01:25:49.185,Hyah ! Hyah !
01:25:55.150,01:25:56.652,Hold !
01:25:56.693,01:25:59.989,Diamond ! Diamond !
01:26:04.367,01:26:06.369,- Yes !
01:26:17.881,01:26:20.134,- Haken !
01:26:43.157,01:26:45.659,This column to the chariot !
01:26:45.701,01:26:47.911,stay with me !
01:26:50.246,01:26:52.166,Quickly !
01:26:52.207,01:26:55.293,- Get out there !
01:27:36.543,01:27:38.962,Maximus !
01:27:41.631,01:27:43.217,Ooh-ooh.
01:27:48.972,01:27:51.600,Single column !
01:27:51.641,01:27:54.978,Single column !
01:28:37.437,01:28:40.523,We win !
01:28:44.111,01:28:47.405,"My history's a little hazy, Cassius."
01:28:47.447,01:28:50.659,But shouldn't the barbarians lose the battle of Carthage ?
01:28:50.700,01:28:52.995,"Uh, yes, sire."
01:28:53.036,01:28:55.164,"Um, forgive me, sire."
01:28:55.205,01:28:59.001,"No, I rather enjoy surprises."
01:28:59.042,01:29:04.589,Who is he ?
01:29:05.882,01:29:10.179,I think I'll meet him.
01:29:10.220,01:29:14.641,Hail to the barbarians !
01:29:28.322,01:29:33.451,Forward ! Arms at ready !
01:29:45.088,01:29:47.590,Drop your weapons !
01:29:49.425,01:29:54.181,"Gladiator, the emperor has asked for you."
01:29:54.223,01:29:56.516,I'm at the emperor's service.
01:30:23.210,01:30:27.630,Rise. Rise.
01:30:34.971,01:30:37.224,"Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard."
01:30:37.266,01:30:40.269,I don't think there's ever been a gladiator to match you.
01:30:40.310,01:30:42.938,"As for this young man, he insists you are Hector reborn."
01:30:42.979,01:30:45.148,Or was it Hercules ?
01:30:45.190,01:30:49.694,Why doesn't the hero reveal himself and tell us all your real name ?
01:30:51.363,01:30:56.576,You do have a name ?
01:30:58.995,01:31:01.790,How dare you show your back to me ?
01:31:01.831,01:31:03.750,Slave !
01:31:03.792,01:31:06.628,You will remove your helmet and tell me your name.
01:31:18.223,01:31:36.325,"My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the armies of the north, general of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius, father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife..."
01:31:36.366,01:31:40.370,and I will have my vengeance...
01:31:46.709,01:31:49.879,Arms !
01:32:00.723,01:32:05.312,Live ! Live ! Live !
01:32:05.354,01:32:11.193,Live ! Live ! Live !
01:32:13.236,01:32:15.989,Live ! Live ! Live !
01:32:16.031,01:32:19.409,Live ! Live !
01:32:52.192,01:32:55.862,"Guards, at rest !"
01:33:44.660,01:33:49.499,Maximus ! Maximus !
01:33:49.541,01:33:52.961,Maximus !
01:33:53.002,01:33:56.047,Maximus !
01:34:16.276,01:34:19.488,Why is he still alive ?
01:34:19.529,01:34:21.615,I don't know.
01:34:21.655,01:34:24.117,He shouldn't be alive.
01:34:24.159,01:34:26.995,It vexes me.
01:34:27.036,01:34:30.332,I'm terribly vexed.
01:34:39.633,01:34:41.468,I did what I had to do.
01:34:41.510,01:34:46.848,"If Father had had his way, the empire would have been torn apart."
01:34:46.889,01:34:49.184,You do see that ?
01:34:49.225,01:34:51.436,Yes.
01:34:54.688,01:34:58.568,What did you feel...
01:35:00.445,01:35:03.323,I felt nothing.
01:35:03.365,01:35:06.660,"He wounded you deeply, didn't he ?"
01:35:07.452,01:35:11.080,No more than I wounded him.
01:35:14.376,01:35:16.961,They lied to me in Germania.
01:35:18.046,01:35:21.049,They told me he was dead.
01:35:22.008,01:35:24.886,"If they lie to me, they don't respect me."
01:35:24.927,01:35:28.014,"If they don't respect me, how can they ever love me ?"
01:35:29.558,01:35:32.310,Then you must let the legions know...
01:35:32.352,01:35:35.813,their treachery will not go unpunished.
01:35:35.855,01:35:40.776,"Poor sister, I wouldn't want to be your enemy."
01:35:41.528,01:35:44.113,What will you do ?
01:35:55.166,01:35:57.460,This way !
01:36:32.495,01:36:35.998,Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured by the bravest champions.
01:36:36.040,01:36:39.085,I knew your brother would send assassins.
01:36:39.127,01:36:42.171,I didn't realize he would send his best.
01:36:43.465,01:36:46.175,"Maximus, he doesn't know."
01:36:46.217,01:36:49.387,My family was burned and crucified while they were still alive.
01:36:49.429,01:36:52.766,I knew nothing-- Don't lie to me !
01:36:58.812,01:37:02.275,I wept for them.
01:37:02.317,01:37:04.902,As you wept for your father ?
01:37:04.944,01:37:08.657,I have been living in a prison of fear since that day.
01:37:08.698,01:37:13.453,To be unable to mourn your father for fear of your brother.
01:37:13.495,01:37:16.414,To live in terror every moment of every day...
01:37:16.456,01:37:19.041,because your son is heir to the throne.
01:37:21.002,01:37:24.172,"Oh, I have wept."
01:37:24.213,01:37:27.383,My son was innocent.
01:37:27.425,01:37:30.261,So is mine.
01:37:31.554,01:37:34.808,"Must my son die, too, before you will trust me ?"
01:37:36.518,01:37:40.188,What does it matter if I trust you or not ?
01:37:40.229,01:37:43.065,The gods have spared you.
01:37:43.107,01:37:46.695,Today I saw a slave become more powerful than the emperor of Rome.
01:37:46.736,01:37:48.862,The gods have spared me ?
01:37:48.904,01:37:52.450,"I am at their mercy, with the power only to amuse a mob !"
01:37:52.492,01:37:55.411,That is power.
01:37:55.453,01:37:58.790,"And while Commodus controls them, he controls everything."
01:37:59.749,01:38:01.710,Listen to me.
01:38:01.751,01:38:04.878,"My brother has enemies, most of all in the senate."
01:38:04.920,01:38:10.677,"But while the people follow him, no one would dare stand up to him until you."
01:38:10.719,01:38:13.429,"They oppose him, yet they do nothing."
01:38:13.471,01:38:17.559,There are some politicians who have dedicated their lives to Rome.
01:38:17.600,01:38:20.186,One man above all.
01:38:20.228,01:38:23.648,"If I can arrange it, will you meet him ?"
01:38:23.690,01:38:25.692,Do you not understand ?
01:38:25.734,01:38:30.112,"I may die in this cell tonight, or in the arena tomorrow."
01:38:30.154,01:38:32.699,What possible difference can I make ?
01:38:32.741,01:38:35.410,This man wants what you want.
01:38:35.451,01:38:38.788,Then have him kill Commodus !
01:38:40.456,01:38:46.504,"I knew a man once, a noble man, a man of principle..."
01:38:46.546,01:38:49.340,who loved my father.
01:38:49.382,01:38:52.594,And my father loved him.
01:38:53.344,01:38:56.138,This man served Rome well.
01:38:59.768,01:39:01.935,That man is gone.
01:39:01.977,01:39:04.439,Your brother did his work well.
01:39:04.480,01:39:07.149,Let me help you.
01:39:12.447,01:39:16.367,"Yes, you can help me."
01:39:18.745,01:39:20.872,Forget you ever knew me...
01:39:20.914,01:39:23.332,and never come here again.
01:39:26.085,01:39:29.923,Guard ! The lady has finished with me.
01:39:57.241,01:39:59.034,Maximus ?
01:39:59.076,01:40:02.831,You commanded legions ?
01:40:02.872,01:40:06.208,Yes.
01:40:07.710,01:40:10.713,In many countries.
01:40:11.339,01:40:14.216,General.
01:41:01.514,01:41:03.892,You have a great name.
01:41:03.933,01:41:07.269,He must kill your name before he kills you.
01:41:16.529,01:41:18.447,"Yes, at the far end."
01:41:18.489,01:41:20.909,Senator Gaius.
01:41:20.950,01:41:23.160,Senator Gracchus.
01:41:24.119,01:41:27.790,Don't often see you enjoying the pleasures of the vulgar crowd.
01:41:27.832,01:41:30.292,"I don't pretend to be a man of the people, Senator."
01:41:30.334,01:41:33.713,But I do try to be a man for the people.
01:41:47.435,01:41:51.439,Caesar ! Caesar ! Caesar !
01:41:51.480,01:41:53.190,Caesar ! Caesar !
01:41:53.232,01:41:57.403,Caesar ! Caesar !
01:41:59.154,01:42:01.950,People of Rome !
01:42:03.659,01:42:10.875,"On the fourth day of Antioch, we can celebrate the 64th day of the games."
01:42:11.709,01:42:21.218,"And, in his majestic charity, the Emperor has deigned this day to favor the people of Rome..."
01:42:21.260,01:42:25.389,with an historical final match.
01:42:25.431,01:42:27.892,Returning to the Colosseum today...
01:42:27.934,01:42:32.313,"after five years in retirement, Caesar..."
01:42:32.354,01:42:36.484,is pleased to bring you the only...
01:42:36.525,01:42:38.736,undefeated champion...
01:42:38.778,01:42:41.154,Yah ! Yah !
01:42:38.778,01:42:46.661,"in Roman history, the legendary Tigris of Gaul !"
01:43:01.676,01:43:04.177,Whoa !
01:43:07.431,01:43:11.102,He knows too well how to manipulate the mob.
01:43:11.144,01:43:13.938,"Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Rome, Proximo."
01:43:13.980,01:43:16.357,This is not it !
01:43:16.398,01:43:19.110,"Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus."
01:43:19.152,01:43:22.279,We mortals are but shadows and dust.
01:43:22.321,01:43:25.616,"Shadows and dust, Maximus !"
01:43:25.658,01:43:33.374,"Representing the training lyceum of Antonius Proximo, Caesar is proud to give you..."
01:43:33.415,01:43:36.669,Aelius Maximus !
01:43:42.508,01:43:47.138,Maximus ! Maximus ! Maximus !
01:43:47.180,01:43:49.974,Maximus ! Maximus !
01:43:50.016,01:43:52.225,They embrace him like he's one of their own.
01:43:52.267,01:43:56.064,"The mob is fickle, brother."
01:43:56.105,01:43:58.983,Maximus ! Maximus !
01:43:59.025,01:44:02.403,"No, much sooner than that."
01:44:03.946,01:44:06.574,It's been arranged.
01:44:11.996,01:44:15.541,Maximus ! Maximus !
01:44:24.050,01:44:26.844,We who are about to die salute you.
01:44:30.305,01:44:33.308,"We're with you, Maximus !"
01:45:14.349,01:45:17.519,"Come on, finish it !"
01:45:43.045,01:45:46.048,- No !
01:45:59.312,01:46:02.397,- Aah !
01:46:07.778,01:46:09.780,Yeah !
01:46:18.622,01:46:21.583,Loose ! Loose !
01:46:35.931,01:46:39.268,Aah !
01:46:41.937,01:46:44.773,Aah !
01:46:48.736,01:46:50.487,Get him !
01:46:50.529,01:46:54.116,Kill ! Kill !
01:46:54.158,01:46:57.119,Kill ! Kill !
01:46:57.161,01:47:00.248,Kill ! Kill !
01:47:00.289,01:47:03.416,Kill ! Kill !
01:47:03.458,01:47:06.503,Kill ! Kill !
01:47:06.545,01:47:10.841,Kill ! Kill !
01:47:10.883,01:47:13.928,Kill ! Kill !
01:47:13.969,01:47:16.931,- Kill ! Kill !
01:47:16.972,01:47:19.350,- Kill !
01:47:19.392,01:47:22.353,Kill ! Kill !
01:47:22.395,01:47:26.523,Kill ! Kill !
01:47:26.565,01:47:30.111,Kill ! Kill !
01:47:30.152,01:47:33.948,Kill ! Kill !
01:47:33.989,01:47:36.992,Kill ! Kill !
01:47:37.034,01:47:40.913,Kill ! Kill !
01:47:54.509,01:47:57.679,Maximus !
01:47:57.721,01:48:01.309,Maximus the Merciful !
01:48:05.396,01:48:07.856,Maximus the Merciful !
01:48:07.898,01:48:09.900,Maximus ! Maximus !
01:48:09.942,01:48:12.194,Maximus ! Maximus !
01:48:12.236,01:48:16.489,Maximus ! Maximus !
01:48:16.531,01:48:19.118,Maximus ! Maximus !
01:48:19.160,01:48:22.997,"Forward, guards !"
01:48:23.038,01:48:25.124,Maximus !
01:48:28.002,01:48:31.504,Maximus ! Maximus !
01:48:31.546,01:48:34.383,Maximus !
01:48:52.276,01:48:56.780,What am I going to do with you ?
01:48:56.822,01:48:59.532,You simply won't...
01:48:59.574,01:49:01.618,die.
01:49:04.997,01:49:08.292,"Are we so different, you and I ?"
01:49:08.334,01:49:10.543,You take life when you have to...
01:49:10.585,01:49:12.380,as I do.
01:49:12.421,01:49:16.717,I have only one more life to take.
01:49:16.758,01:49:19.345,Then take it now.
01:49:31.524,01:49:34.235,They tell me your son...
01:49:34.276,01:49:36.611,squealed like a girl...
01:49:36.653,01:49:39.572,when they nailed him to the cross.
01:49:39.614,01:49:44.661,And your wife...
01:49:46.455,01:49:48.749,when they ravaged her...
01:49:48.790,01:49:51.377,again and again...
01:49:52.336,01:49:54.629,and again.
01:49:58.926,01:50:02.971,The time for honoring yourself will soon be at an end.
01:50:07.726,01:50:09.978,Highness.
01:50:21.156,01:50:25.202,Maximus ! Maximus !
01:50:25.244,01:50:28.581,Maximus ! Maximus !
01:50:28.621,01:50:34.002,Maximus ! Maximus !
01:50:35.837,01:50:39.341,General !
01:50:39.383,01:50:41.218,General !
01:50:41.260,01:50:44.054,General !
01:50:44.096,01:50:46.807,General !
01:50:46.848,01:50:49.642,Maximus ! Maximus !
01:50:49.684,01:50:52.062,General !
01:50:52.104,01:50:54.523,- General.
01:50:54.565,01:50:58.277,- Ostia.
01:50:58.319,01:51:02.490,Maximus ! Maximus !
01:51:02.531,01:51:05.367,"- We love you, Maximus !"
01:51:05.409,01:51:08.245,Tell the men their general lives.
01:51:08.287,01:51:11.373,Move along !
01:51:11.415,01:51:16.504,Maximus ! Maximus !
01:51:35.481,01:51:38.400,Can they hear you ?
01:51:41.069,01:51:43.030,Who ?
01:51:43.071,01:51:46.408,"Your family, in the afterlife."
01:51:47.409,01:51:50.120,"Oh, yes."
01:51:53.915,01:51:58.420,"To my boy, I tell him I will see him again soon."
01:51:58.462,01:52:03.425,To keep his heels down when he's riding his horse.
01:52:04.801,01:52:11.058,To my wife-- That is not your business.
01:52:17.939,01:52:22.403,And now they love Maximus for his mercy.
01:52:22.444,01:52:26.407,"So I can't just kill him, or it makes me even more unmerciful !"
01:52:27.575,01:52:32.829,The whole thing's like some crazed nightmare.
01:52:32.871,01:52:35.416,He is defying you.
01:52:35.457,01:52:38.544,His every victory is an act of defiance.
01:52:38.586,01:52:42.631,"The mob sees this, and so do the senate."
01:52:42.673,01:52:47.261,"Every day he lives, they grow bolder."
01:52:47.302,01:52:49.722,- Kill him.
01:52:50.805,01:52:53.850,I will not make a martyr of him.
01:52:59.189,01:53:01.400,I have been told...
01:53:01.442,01:53:03.193,of a certain sea snake...
01:53:03.235,01:53:07.656,which has a very unusual method of attracting its prey.
01:53:07.698,01:53:12.453,It will lie at the bottom of the ocean as if wounded.
01:53:12.494,01:53:17.708,"Then its enemies will approach, and yet it will lie quite still."
01:53:17.750,01:53:24.757,"And then its enemies will take little bites of it, and yet it remains..."
01:53:24.797,01:53:27.635,still.
01:53:28.927,01:53:33.682,"So, we will lie still..."
01:53:33.724,01:53:37.102,and let our enemies come to us and nibble.
01:53:37.144,01:53:40.981,Have every senator followed.
01:53:54.035,01:53:56.121,Maximus.
01:53:57.456,01:53:59.416,"Cicero, my old friend."
01:53:59.458,01:54:01.460,I thought I'd seen you for the last time.
01:54:01.502,01:54:03.754,I thought you were dead.
01:54:03.796,01:54:06.298,How long have the men been in Ostia ?
01:54:06.340,01:54:09.343,All winter.
01:54:09.384,01:54:11.595,Fattened and bored.
01:54:11.637,01:54:13.555,Who's in command ?
01:54:13.597,01:54:16.350,Some fool from Rome.
01:54:16.391,01:54:20.562,How soon do you think they could be ready to fight ?
01:54:21.730,01:54:24.483,I need you to do something for me.
01:54:28.570,01:54:30.322,Come see. Witness.
01:54:30.364,01:54:33.283,"If you haven't been in the arena, you can see the show here."
01:54:33.325,01:54:38.038,Giant Maximus is defeating our Emperor Commodus.
01:54:38.079,01:54:40.874,He's defying everyone.
01:54:40.915,01:54:43.711,Ah ! Look at that !
01:54:43.752,01:54:46.087,"- Oh, he got him !"
01:54:46.129,01:54:49.049,Give way ! Give way !
01:54:49.090,01:54:51.552,Give way !
01:54:52.845,01:54:55.639,Three casks of red wine.
01:54:55.681,01:54:58.016,My lady ? I served your father at Vindobona.
01:54:58.058,01:55:00.101,Back.
01:55:00.143,01:55:02.187,I served your father at Vindobona.
01:55:02.229,01:55:05.232,Back !
01:55:05.273,01:55:07.526,I serve him still.
01:55:07.568,01:55:09.403,Stop.
01:55:09.444,01:55:11.613,Stop.
01:55:11.655,01:55:14.908,Stand back.
01:55:14.949,01:55:18.119,The General sends word.
01:55:19.954,01:55:24.251,"- For your loyalty, soldier."
01:55:24.292,01:55:26.961,Hup !
01:55:32.885,01:55:35.888,Leave us.
01:55:40.225,01:55:42.310,Senator Gracchus.
01:55:55.657,01:55:57.785,General.
01:55:57.826,01:56:02.122,I hope my coming here today is evidence enough that...
01:56:02.163,01:56:04.291,you can trust me.
01:56:07.669,01:56:10.672,The senate is with you ?
01:56:12.340,01:56:15.636,Yes. I can speak for them.
01:56:15.677,01:56:19.306,You can buy my freedom and smuggle me out of Rome ?
01:56:19.347,01:56:22.058,To what end ?
01:56:22.100,01:56:24.728,Get me outside the city walls.
01:56:24.770,01:56:28.774,Have fresh horses ready to take me to Ostia.
01:56:28.816,01:56:32.486,"By nightfall of the second day, I shall return at the head of 5,000 men."
01:56:32.527,01:56:36.156,But the legions all have new commanders loyal to Commodus.
01:56:36.197,01:56:39.701,"Let my men see me alive, and you shall see where their loyalties lie."
01:56:39.743,01:56:41.662,This is madness.
01:56:41.703,01:56:45.290,No Roman army has entered the capital in a hundred years.
01:56:41.703,01:56:47.751,Gracchus-- I will not trade one dictatorship for another !
01:56:47.793,01:56:52.172,"The time for half-measures and talk is over, Senator."
01:56:52.213,01:56:55.801,"And after your glorious coup, what then ?"
01:56:55.843,01:56:59.513,"You'll take your 5,000 warriors and leave ?"
01:56:59.554,01:57:01.556,I will leave.
01:57:01.598,01:57:05.602,"The soldiers will stay for your protection, under the command of the senate."
01:57:05.644,01:57:12.192,"So, once all of Rome is yours, you'll just give it back to the people ?"
01:57:12.233,01:57:14.361,Tell me why.
01:57:19.825,01:57:22.744,Because that was the last wish of a dying man.
01:57:26.039,01:57:28.249,I will kill Commodus.
01:57:29.835,01:57:33.755,The fate of Rome I leave to you.
01:57:34.798,01:57:37.801,Marcus Aurelius trusted you.
01:57:38.886,01:57:41.763,His daughter trusts you.
01:57:44.892,01:57:46.935,I will trust you.
01:57:46.977,01:57:49.646,But we have little time.
01:57:49.688,01:57:51.690,Give me two days...
01:57:51.732,01:57:55.193,and I will buy your freedom.
01:57:55.235,01:58:00.741,And you-- You stay alive.
01:58:00.782,01:58:04.077,Or I'll be dead.
01:58:04.118,01:58:06.747,Now we must go.
01:58:10.959,01:58:13.879,It won't work.
01:58:13.921,01:58:17.173,The Emperor knows too much.
01:58:17.215,01:58:23.513,"And as for me, it's becoming dangerous."
01:58:23.555,01:58:26.266,You will be paid on my return.
01:58:27.726,01:58:29.853,I give you my word.
01:58:29.895,01:58:32.522,Your word ?
01:58:32.564,01:58:36.276,"Do you remember what it was to have trust, Proximo ?"
01:58:36.317,01:58:39.153,Trust ?
01:58:42.323,01:58:44.325,Who am I to trust ?
01:58:44.367,01:58:46.912,I will kill Commodus.
01:58:46.954,01:58:48.997,Why would I want that ?
01:58:49.039,01:58:51.291,He makes me rich.
01:58:53.668,01:58:59.340,"Oh, I-- I know that you are a man of your word, General."
01:59:00.383,01:59:03.386,I know that you would die for honor.
01:59:04.638,01:59:07.140,You would die for Rome.
01:59:07.181,01:59:09.726,You would die for the memory of your ancestors.
01:59:09.768,01:59:17.985,"But I, on the other hand-- I'm an entertainer."
01:59:19.694,01:59:22.363,Hmm ?
01:59:26.701,01:59:29.329,He killed the man who set you free.
01:59:38.379,01:59:41.091,"Praetorians, master."
01:59:46.847,01:59:49.057,Halt !
01:59:58.650,02:00:00.777,Where have you been ?
02:00:00.819,02:00:03.113,I sent for you.
02:00:03.947,02:00:06.240,"Please, brother."
02:00:10.537,02:00:12.580,What's troubling you ?
02:00:15.667,02:00:18.419,Does Gracchus have a new lover ?
02:00:19.838,02:00:22.090,I don't know.
02:00:22.966,02:00:25.259,I thought you'd seen him.
02:00:26.260,02:00:29.389,He infects everyone like a putrid fever.
02:00:30.473,02:00:33.018,"For the health of Rome, the senate must be bled."
02:00:34.102,02:00:36.229,"And he will bleed, too."
02:00:36.270,02:00:39.191,Very soon.
02:00:40.067,02:00:42.485,But not tonight.
02:00:56.124,02:00:58.960,Do you remember what our father said once ?
02:01:00.837,02:01:11.472,It's a dream-- a frightful dream-- life is.
02:01:13.016,02:01:15.435,Do you think that's true ?
02:01:15.476,02:01:18.230,I don't know.
02:01:20.899,02:01:23.151,I think it is.
02:01:25.195,02:01:28.322,And I have only you to share it with.
02:02:05.860,02:02:08.155,Open your mouth.
02:02:44.149,02:02:46.526,You know I love you.
02:02:48.528,02:02:51.072,And I love you.
02:03:26.274,02:03:28.818,Out.
02:03:28.860,02:03:31.487,Move !
02:03:35.283,02:03:37.327,"Congratulations, General."
02:03:37.369,02:03:41.289,You've got very...
02:03:46.211,02:03:48.671,My brother's had Gracchus arrested.
02:03:48.713,02:03:52.717,We daren't wait any longer.
02:03:52.759,02:03:56.596,Proximo will come at midnight and take you to the gate.
02:03:56.637,02:03:59.766,"Your servant, Cicero, will be waiting there with horses."
02:04:02.227,02:04:04.187,You have done all this ?
02:04:04.229,02:04:07.481,Yes.
02:04:08.482,02:04:11.319,I have much to pay for.
02:04:12.820,02:04:14.614,You have nothing to pay for.
02:04:14.655,02:04:18.618,You love your son.
02:04:21.371,02:04:25.125,I am tired of being strong.
02:04:25.166,02:04:30.004,"My brother hates all the world, and you most of all."
02:04:30.046,02:04:34.342,Because your father chose me.
02:04:35.093,02:04:37.845,Because my father loved you.
02:04:41.182,02:04:44.352,And because I loved you.
02:04:46.187,02:04:48.440,A long time ago.
02:04:52.235,02:04:54.737,Was I very different then ?
02:05:01.202,02:05:03.455,You laughed more.
02:05:07.083,02:05:13.256,"I have felt alone all my life, except with you."
02:05:15.675,02:05:17.635,I must go.
02:05:17.677,02:05:20.472,Yes.
02:05:46.580,02:05:48.666,There. There.
02:05:48.708,02:05:52.379,There. There. There.
02:05:52.420,02:05:54.714,There. There. There.
02:05:54.755,02:05:56.674,There. There. There.
02:05:56.716,02:05:59.386,There. There.
02:05:59.427,02:06:01.637,And I've got you.
02:06:03.890,02:06:06.393,Isn't it late to be playing legionnaire ?
02:06:06.434,02:06:09.020,I'm not a legionnaire.
02:06:09.062,02:06:11.481,Not a legionnaire ?
02:06:12.606,02:06:16.569,A gladiator ?
02:06:16.610,02:06:18.738,Wouldn't you rather be...
02:06:18.779,02:06:21.074,a great Roman warrior like Julius Caesar ?
02:06:21.115,02:06:24.536,"I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome !"
02:06:25.912,02:06:28.498,The savior of Rome ?
02:06:36.464,02:06:38.716,And who said that ?
02:06:47.100,02:06:49.394,Where's Lucius ?
02:06:49.436,02:06:51.687,"He's with the Emperor, my lady."
02:06:54.857,02:06:58.111,She couldn't.
02:06:58.152,02:07:04.075,"She took it from a basket and pressed it to her breast, right here above her heart."
02:07:05.868,02:07:08.538,It bit her in the breast ?
02:07:08.580,02:07:10.331,Yes.
02:07:10.373,02:07:13.167,"You see, Lucius, sometimes royal ladies..."
02:07:13.209,02:07:17.297,behave very strangely and do very odd things in the name of love.
02:07:17.338,02:07:19.591,I think it's silly.
02:07:19.632,02:07:21.675,So do I.
02:07:22.969,02:07:24.887,So do I.
02:07:24.929,02:07:27.098,"Sister, join us."
02:07:27.140,02:07:29.309,I've been reading to dear Lucius.
02:07:29.350,02:07:32.145,I've been reading too.
02:07:32.186,02:07:34.147,He's a very clever little boy.
02:07:34.188,02:07:37.108,He'll make a grand emperor one day.
02:07:37.150,02:07:40.820,We've been reading about the great Mark Antony and his adventures in Egypt.
02:07:40.861,02:07:42.905,The queen killed herself with a snake.
02:07:42.947,02:07:46.534,wait until you hear what happened to our ancestors.
02:07:46.576,02:07:53.291,"If you're very good, tomorrow night I'll tell you the story of Emperor Claudius."
02:07:53.333,02:07:56.127,He was betrayed...
02:07:56.169,02:07:58.712,by those closest to him.
02:07:59.880,02:08:01.882,By his own blood.
02:08:03.050,02:08:05.595,They whispered in dark corners...
02:08:05.637,02:08:07.847,and went out late at night...
02:08:07.888,02:08:10.475,and conspired...
02:08:10.517,02:08:13.811,and conspired.
02:08:13.853,02:08:16.856,But the Emperor Claudius knew that they were up to something.
02:08:16.897,02:08:20.901,He knew they were busy little bees.
02:08:22.570,02:08:26.324,And one night he sat down with one of them...
02:08:26.366,02:08:29.076,and he looked at her...
02:08:29.118,02:08:42.465,"and he said, Tell me what you've been doing, busy little bee, or I shall strike down those dearest to you."
02:08:42.507,02:08:47.428,You shall watch as I bathe in their blood.
02:08:49.930,02:08:53.017,And the Emperor was heartbroken.
02:08:54.602,02:08:57.230,The little bee had wounded him more deeply...
02:08:57.271,02:09:00.149,than anyone else could ever have done.
02:09:00.191,02:09:05.905,"And what do you think happened then, Lucius ?"
02:09:05.946,02:09:08.575,"I don't know, Uncle."
02:09:13.705,02:09:16.457,The little bee told him everything.
02:09:55.663,02:09:59.375,"Open, in the name of the Emperor !"
02:09:59.417,02:10:01.085,Proximo !
02:10:01.127,02:10:04.797,Open the gates in the name of the Emperor !
02:10:04.838,02:10:07.967,- Proximo !
02:10:08.008,02:10:10.511,Open the gates !
02:10:16.392,02:10:18.978,"Open the gates, Proximo !"
02:10:19.019,02:10:22.356,"Do you want to die, old man ?"
02:10:22.398,02:10:24.651,Here.
02:10:24.692,02:10:26.860,Everything is prepared.
02:10:26.902,02:10:29.989,It seems you've won your freedom.
02:10:26.902,02:10:32.825,"Proximo, are you in danger of becoming a good man ?"
02:10:32.866,02:10:34.786,Ha !
02:10:37.705,02:10:41.542,- Juba.
02:10:41.584,02:10:46.213,Open the gates !
02:10:49.925,02:10:52.219,Pull !
02:10:53.887,02:10:57.224,Move ! Two columns on the left !
02:11:00.060,02:11:02.814,"I only need moments, so do not be careless with your lives."
02:11:02.855,02:11:06.400,"If you don't want any part of this, go back to your cells."
02:11:06.442,02:11:08.361,"We'll wait here for you, Maximus."
02:11:08.402,02:11:11.739,Strength and honor.
02:11:12.532,02:11:15.785,Strength and honor.
02:11:16.577,02:11:20.289,Aim !
02:12:26.480,02:12:28.441,Shadows and dust.
02:12:28.482,02:12:30.818,Aah !
02:13:08.689,02:13:11.358,Maximus !
02:13:15.738,02:13:18.031,I'm sorry.
02:13:18.073,02:13:20.660,No !
02:13:44.558,02:13:46.811,It's done.
02:13:53.066,02:13:55.653,And what of my nephew ?
02:13:55.695,02:13:58.322,And what of his mother ?
02:13:59.907,02:14:03.035,Should they share her lover's fate ?
02:14:04.411,02:14:07.122,Or should I be merciful ?
02:14:09.041,02:14:11.878,Commodus the Merciful.
02:14:17.591,02:14:20.761,Lucius will stay with me now.
02:14:20.803,02:14:24.015,And if his mother...
02:14:24.056,02:14:27.518,so much as looks at me...
02:14:27.560,02:14:34.107,"in a manner that displeases me, he will die."
02:14:36.903,02:14:39.238,If she decides...
02:14:39.279,02:14:41.782,to be noble...
02:14:41.824,02:14:47.788,"and takes her own life, he will die."
02:14:50.290,02:14:57.673,"And as for you, you will love me..."
02:14:57.715,02:15:00.092,as I loved you.
02:15:00.968,02:15:03.596,You will provide me with an heir...
02:15:03.637,02:15:05.806,of pure blood...
02:15:05.848,02:15:08.851,so that Commodus and his progeny...
02:15:08.893,02:15:11.812,will rule for a thousand years.
02:15:15.608,02:15:18.277,Am I not merciful ?
02:15:39.339,02:15:42.051,Am I not merciful ?
02:15:53.938,02:15:55.982,Maximus ! Maximus !
02:15:56.023,02:15:58.943,Maximus ! Maximus !
02:15:58.985,02:16:01.821,Maximus ! Maximus !
02:16:01.862,02:16:04.115,Maximus ! Maximus !
02:16:04.156,02:16:06.158,Maximus ! Maximus !
02:16:06.199,02:16:10.162,Maximus ! Maximus !
02:16:10.203,02:16:13.165,Maximus !
02:16:13.206,02:16:15.960,Maximus !
02:16:16.002,02:16:18.671,Maximus !
02:16:18.712,02:16:20.673,Maximus !
02:16:20.714,02:16:23.009,Maximus !
02:16:23.050,02:16:25.260,Maximus !
02:16:25.302,02:16:28.681,Maximus ! Maximus !
02:16:28.722,02:16:31.809,Maximus !
02:16:31.851,02:16:34.436,Maximus !
02:16:38.732,02:16:40.860,Maximus.
02:16:40.901,02:16:43.236,Maximus.
02:16:43.278,02:16:45.364,Maximus.
02:16:46.406,02:16:48.617,They call for you.
02:16:49.952,02:16:53.789,The general who became a slave.
02:16:53.831,02:16:57.417,The slave who became a gladiator.
02:16:58.251,02:17:01.922,The gladiator who defied an emperor.
02:17:03.090,02:17:05.634,A striking story.
02:17:05.676,02:17:09.138,Now the people want to know how the story ends.
02:17:11.223,02:17:13.934,Only a famous death will do.
02:17:15.102,02:17:18.064,And what could be more glorious...
02:17:18.105,02:17:22.401,than to challenge the Emperor himself in the great arena ?
02:17:24.611,02:17:26.822,You would fight me ?
02:17:26.864,02:17:30.450,Why not ?
02:17:30.492,02:17:34.454,I think you have been afraid all your life.
02:17:34.496,02:17:39.126,"Unlike Maximus the Invincible, who knows no fear ?"
02:17:44.297,02:17:48.719,"I knew a man who once said, Death smiles at us all."
02:17:48.761,02:17:51.931,All a man can do is smile back.
02:17:51.972,02:17:54.558,I wonder.
02:17:54.600,02:17:57.436,Did your friend smile at his own death ?
02:17:58.395,02:18:00.439,You must know.
02:18:02.649,02:18:05.236,He was your father.
02:18:08.155,02:18:11.951,"You loved my father, I know."
02:18:11.992,02:18:14.954,But so did I.
02:18:14.995,02:18:17.497,"That makes us brothers, doesn't it ?"
02:18:19.332,02:18:22.461,"Smile for me now, brother."
02:18:26.173,02:18:28.884,Strap on his armor.
02:18:28.926,02:18:32.012,Conceal the wound.
02:18:36.976,02:18:39.145,Maximus ! Maximus !
02:18:39.186,02:18:42.273,Maximus ! Maximus !
02:19:24.190,02:19:26.483,Ring formation !
02:19:26.525,02:19:29.236,Ring formation !
02:19:58.557,02:20:02.269,"Off with his head, Maximus !"
02:21:06.083,02:21:10.170,- Aah !
02:21:17.219,02:21:19.638,Maximus ! Maximus !
02:21:19.679,02:21:22.015,"Quintus, sword !"
02:21:22.057,02:21:25.185,Give me your sword !
02:21:26.853,02:21:29.315,Sword !
02:21:29.356,02:21:32.151,Sheathe your swords !
02:21:32.192,02:21:35.321,Sheathe your swords !
02:23:49.662,02:23:51.998,Maximus.
02:23:55.877,02:23:59.672,- Maximus.
02:24:01.300,02:24:04.219,Free my men.
02:24:04.261,02:24:07.013,Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated.
02:24:08.056,02:24:09.766,There was a dream that was Rome.
02:24:09.808,02:24:13.686,It shall be realized.
02:24:13.728,02:24:16.356,These are the wishes of Marcus Aurelius.
02:24:16.398,02:24:19.692,Free the prisoners !
02:24:43.342,02:24:45.594,Maximus !
02:24:47.220,02:24:49.722,Lucius is safe.
02:25:05.030,02:25:07.407,Go to them.
02:25:55.247,02:25:57.916,You're home.
02:26:23.650,02:26:27.487,Is Rome worth one good man's life ?
02:26:30.699,02:26:33.201,We believed it once.
02:26:35.161,02:26:37.456,Make us believe it again.
02:26:41.418,02:26:44.129,He was a soldier of Rome.
02:26:47.340,02:26:49.635,Honor him.
02:26:49.676,02:26:52.512,Who will help me carry him ?
02:27:36.181,02:27:38.850,Now we are free.
02:27:44.105,02:27:46.941,I will see you again.
02:27:48.943,02:27:51.404,But not yet.
02:27:51.446,02:27:53.699,Not yet.
