00:00:35.083,00:00:37.083,Ta-da!
00:00:37.125,00:00:38.500,Ta-da!
00:01:47.542,00:01:49.250,Ha-ha-ha!
00:01:54.917,00:01:56.959,Whoo-whoo-whoo!
00:02:00.583,00:02:01.917,Huh?
00:02:07.250,00:02:08.291,Huh?
00:02:08.333,00:02:10.208,Aaah!
00:02:28.500,00:02:30.000,Whoa!
00:03:13.250,00:03:18.333,"Hmm. Three weeks, and we're still no closer to cracking this."
00:03:18.375,00:03:20.667,Right. Bring him in.
00:03:20.709,00:03:22.125,"Yes, sir."
00:03:44.083,00:03:46.291,Yea!
00:03:46.333,00:03:48.458,This is the best party ever!
00:04:03.208,00:04:04.625,Ha-ha!
00:04:07.333,00:04:09.792,Ha!
00:04:16.583,00:04:19.583,"Oh, no!"
00:04:25.208,00:04:28.917,"Fear not, for here come the gallant knights to save us."
00:04:28.959,00:04:30.333,Yea!
00:04:34.542,00:04:36.709,Hey!
00:04:42.917,00:04:45.291,Hey-ho!
00:04:45.333,00:04:47.291,Hey!
00:04:47.333,00:04:50.083,"No, no, no."
00:04:50.125,00:04:53.000,I have a backyard full of these little girls...
00:04:53.041,00:04:55.750,who are counting on a visit from a fairy princess.
00:04:55.792,00:04:57.583,Aaah! Hurt!
00:05:02.375,00:05:04.542,Listen!
00:05:04.583,00:05:08.125,I don't want a refund!
00:05:08.166,00:05:10.667,"Please, I'm begging you."
00:05:10.709,00:05:13.083,You know what?
00:05:10.709,00:05:16.166,"I hope that you can sleep at night, you crusher of little girls' dreams!"
00:05:16.208,00:05:18.083,"Ooh, ooh!"
00:05:19.125,00:05:20.792,Any minute now.
00:05:20.834,00:05:22.291,Yea!
00:05:23.667,00:05:27.041,-Stall them!
00:05:28.625,00:05:30.250,Ooh!
00:05:40.083,00:05:42.458,Whoa! Whoa!
00:05:42.500,00:05:44.208,That's enough of the magic show.
00:05:44.250,00:05:46.625,Aw!
00:05:46.667,00:05:49.667,Wait. Did you hear that?
00:05:49.709,00:05:53.542,It sounded like the twinkling sounds of magical fairy dust.
00:05:53.583,00:05:55.917,It's the fairy princess!
00:05:55.959,00:05:57.750,Look!
00:06:07.000,00:06:08.667,Huh?
00:06:11.291,00:06:14.917,Aaah!
00:06:16.041,00:06:17.166,Ow.
00:06:23.750,00:06:25.291,Ah!
00:06:25.333,00:06:33.875,"It is I, Gru... zinkerbell, the most magical fairy princess of all!"
00:06:33.917,00:06:37.834,And I am here to wish Princess Agnes...
00:06:37.875,00:06:40.250,a very happy birthday!
00:06:40.291,00:06:42.291,How come you're so fat?
00:06:42.333,00:06:51.417,"Because my house is made of candy, and sometimes I eat instead of facing my problems."
00:06:51.458,00:06:55.750,"How come you have-- Okay, time for cake."
00:06:55.792,00:06:58.500,Yea!
00:06:58.542,00:06:59.959,Oof.
00:07:00.000,00:07:02.208,"Thank you, Gruzinkerbell!"
00:07:02.250,00:07:04.208,You're the best fairy princess ever!
00:07:04.250,00:07:07.250,"You are welcome, little girl."
00:07:09.125,00:07:11.166,"I know it's really you, Gru."
00:07:11.208,00:07:14.417,I'm just pretending for the other kids.
00:07:18.083,00:07:21.166,"Hey there, Gru, Mr. Life of the Party!"
00:07:21.208,00:07:22.917,"Hello, Jillian."
00:07:22.959,00:07:35.208,"So, I'm gonna go out on a limb here, but my friend Natalie is recently single, and-- No, no, no."
00:07:35.250,00:07:37.458,Come on. She's a riot!
00:07:37.500,00:07:43.375,"She sings karaoke, she has a lot of free time, looks aren't that important to her."
00:07:43.417,00:07:46.500,"No, Jills."
00:07:46.542,00:07:49.166,"Seriously, I'm fine."
00:07:49.208,00:07:51.250,How about my cousin Linda?
00:07:51.291,00:07:59.583,Oh! Oh! I know someone whose husband just died-- I'm sorry.
00:08:01.000,00:08:03.875,Or there.
00:08:12.333,00:08:15.000,Kyle? Kyle?
00:08:15.041,00:08:17.959,Ky-- Kyle! No!
00:08:19.875,00:08:22.208,There you go.
00:08:23.917,00:08:28.041,Good boy!
00:08:28.083,00:08:30.125,Mr. Gru?
00:08:32.125,00:08:35.667,Hi! Agent Lucy Wilde of the A.V.L.
00:08:35.709,00:08:37.875,Whoops!
00:08:37.917,00:08:39.709,Sorry.
00:08:39.750,00:08:42.417,You're gonna have to come with me.
00:08:39.750,00:08:43.333,"Oh, sorry, I-- Freeze ray!"
00:08:47.667,00:08:51.625,"You know, you really should announce your weapons after you fire them, Mr. Gru."
00:08:51.667,00:08:58.709,For example-- Lipstick Taser!
00:08:58.750,00:09:00.583,"Oh, it works so good."
00:09:09.875,00:09:11.250,Man!
00:09:12.583,00:09:14.417,Large person.
00:09:21.417,00:09:23.166,"Oh, sorry."
00:09:26.875,00:09:29.083,Get... in... there-- Hmm?
00:09:29.125,00:09:32.125,you... big... man!
00:09:36.917,00:09:38.750,Boss!
00:09:52.917,00:09:55.041,Huh? Uh!
00:09:57.000,00:09:59.041,-Whoa!
00:10:01.583,00:10:03.417,Huh? Ahh.
00:10:03.458,00:10:05.959,-Whoo!
00:10:23.500,00:10:25.583,Huh?
00:10:28.959,00:10:31.208,"Quack, quack!"
00:10:37.000,00:10:38.542,-Whoa!
00:10:56.375,00:10:58.041,What the-- Whoa!
00:11:23.375,00:11:25.041,Huh?
00:11:41.583,00:11:43.959,-Whoa!
00:12:28.041,00:12:30.583,Boss.
00:12:28.041,00:12:33.000,Ho-- Whoa. Foot's asleep.
00:12:33.041,00:12:36.834,"Ah, pins and needles!"
00:12:36.875,00:12:38.458,"Good afternoon, Mr. Gru."
00:12:38.500,00:12:40.000,Eh.
00:12:40.041,00:12:42.834,I apologize for our methods in getting you here.
00:12:42.875,00:12:44.709,I don't.
00:12:44.750,00:12:47.083,I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
00:12:47.125,00:12:49.959,I enjoyed that.
00:12:50.000,00:12:51.917,"That's enough, Agent Wilde."
00:12:51.959,00:12:54.667,"Sorry, sir."
00:12:56.333,00:13:03.583,"I don't know who you people think you are, but-- We are the Anti-Villain League, an ultra-secret organization..."
00:13:03.625,00:13:07.500,dedicated to fighting crime on a global scale.
00:13:07.542,00:13:09.959,"Rob a bank, we're not interested."
00:13:10.000,00:13:12.458,"Kill someone, not our deal."
00:13:12.500,00:13:15.417,But you want to melt the polar ice caps...
00:13:15.458,00:13:23.583,"or vaporize Mount Fuji or even steal the moon, then we notice."
00:13:23.625,00:13:26.583,"First of all, you got no proof that I did that."
00:13:26.625,00:13:30.500,"Second, after I did do that, I put it back."
00:13:30.542,00:13:32.250,"We're well aware of that, Mr. Gru."
00:13:32.291,00:13:34.458,That's why we brought you here.
00:13:34.500,00:13:38.500,"I am the League's director, Silas Ramsbottom."
00:13:38.542,00:13:40.250,Bottom.
00:13:43.250,00:13:45.709,Hilarious.
00:13:45.750,00:13:47.583,Agent Wilde?
00:13:47.625,00:13:49.458,"Oh, me now?"
00:13:49.500,00:13:53.208,"Um, recently, an entire top-secret lab disappeared from the arctic circle."
00:13:53.250,00:13:57.834,"Yeah, the entire lab, just-- psst! Voo! Gone."
00:13:57.875,00:14:00.583,-Where did it go?
00:14:00.625,00:14:06.375,"Hmm. The lab was devoted to experiments involving PX-41, a transmutation serum."
00:14:06.417,00:14:08.625,"What is PX-41, you ask?"
00:14:08.667,00:14:10.166,"Mmm, it's pretty bad. Look."
00:14:19.583,00:14:20.792,Ah!
00:14:23.000,00:14:25.667,Oh!
00:14:30.458,00:14:33.208,Huh. You usually don't see that in bunnies.
00:14:33.250,00:14:40.542,"As you can see, in the wrong hands, the PX-41 serum could be the most devastating weapon on Earth."
00:14:42.291,00:14:46.458,"Fortunately, it has a very distinct chemical footprint."
00:14:46.500,00:14:53.083,"And using the latest chem-tracking technology, we found traces of it in the Paradise Mall."
00:14:53.125,00:14:55.375,A mall?
00:14:55.417,00:14:59.792,And we believe that one of these shop owners is a master criminal.
00:14:59.834,00:15:01.667,And that's where you come in.
00:15:01.709,00:15:05.792,"As an ex-villain, you know how a villain thinks, how a villain acts."
00:15:05.834,00:15:16.375,"The plan is to set you up undercover at a shop in the mall, where, hopefully, you'll be able to-- Okay, I see where this is going, with all the Mission: Impossible stuff, but no, no!"
00:15:16.417,00:15:19.917,I'm a father now and a legitimate businessman.
00:15:19.959,00:15:23.667,I am developing a line of delicious jams and jellies.
00:15:23.709,00:15:27.000,Jams and jellies?
00:15:27.041,00:15:30.000,Oh! Attitude.
00:15:30.041,00:15:31.959,"So thanks, but no, thanks."
00:15:32.875,00:15:40.834,"And here's a tip: Instead of tasing people and kidnapping them, maybe you should just give them a call!"
00:15:40.875,00:15:43.250,"Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt."
00:15:43.291,00:15:46.542,Ramsbottom.
00:15:46.583,00:15:48.667,Ramsbottom.
00:16:00.375,00:16:05.792,"Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but your work as a villain was kind of amazing."
00:16:05.834,00:16:12.458,"So if you ever wanna get back to doing something awesome, give us a call."
00:16:23.083,00:16:24.667,Yeah.
00:16:32.041,00:16:33.709,"Hey, I told you guys to get to bed."
00:16:33.750,00:16:35.417,"Oh, sorry."
00:16:35.458,00:16:37.875,"-So, when you goin' on your date?"
00:16:37.917,00:16:40.667,Remember? Miss Jillian said she was arranging a date for you.
00:16:40.709,00:16:44.625,"Yeah, well, she is a nut job, and I'm not goin' on any date."
00:16:44.667,00:16:46.625,Why not?
00:16:53.500,00:16:57.083,"Hey, did you guys see the moon landing on TV?"
00:16:57.125,00:16:59.458,"Yeah, I can't believe it."
00:16:59.500,00:17:01.709,"Yeah, and you know what?"
00:17:01.750,00:17:03.583,Excuse me? Lisa?
00:17:03.625,00:17:06.208,He is so cute.
00:17:06.250,00:17:08.291,"Hey, Lisa."
00:17:06.250,00:17:12.333,I was wondering if you-- Ew!
00:17:12.375,00:17:14.083,Ew!
00:17:14.125,00:17:16.083,Lisa's got Grooties!
00:17:23.667,00:17:26.458,Scared? Of what?
00:17:26.500,00:17:28.792,That's bonkers.
00:17:26.500,00:17:31.875,I just-- I have no interest in goin' on a date. That's all.
00:17:31.917,00:17:35.208,I'm not scared.
00:17:35.250,00:17:37.583,Let's go to bed.
00:17:37.625,00:17:39.500,"Good night, Edith."
00:17:40.834,00:17:43.417,"Good night, Margo."
00:17:43.458,00:17:45.375,Hold the horses.
00:17:45.417,00:17:47.083,No one.
00:17:47.125,00:17:49.667,Avery. A-Avery?
00:17:49.709,00:17:51.709,Is that a girl's name or a boy's name?
00:17:51.750,00:17:53.458,Does it matter?
00:17:53.500,00:17:57.000,"No, no, it doesn't matter unless it's a boy!"
00:17:57.041,00:17:59.291,I know what makes you a boy.
00:17:59.333,00:18:00.834,Uh-- Ooh.
00:18:00.875,00:18:02.500,You do?
00:18:02.542,00:18:05.125,Your bald head.
00:18:05.166,00:18:07.458,"Oh, yes."
00:18:07.500,00:18:09.834,It's really smooth.
00:18:09.875,00:18:13.166,Sometimes I stare at it and imagine a little chick popping out.
00:18:13.208,00:18:16.375,"Peep, peep, peep!"
00:18:16.417,00:18:18.375,"Good night, Agnes."
00:18:19.625,00:18:21.166,Never get older.
00:18:32.792,00:18:34.792,"Hey, oh!"
00:19:00.375,00:19:02.625,"Okay, okay."
00:19:32.875,00:19:34.750,"Hey, Tim. Nice haircut."
00:19:34.792,00:19:37.000,"Donnie, hang in there, baby."
00:19:37.041,00:19:39.125,It's almost Friday.
00:19:39.166,00:19:42.083,"So, how's today's batch, Dr. Nefario?"
00:19:42.125,00:19:46.000,"I developed a new formula, which allowed me to get every known kind of berry..."
00:19:46.041,00:19:48.291,into one flavor of jelly.
00:19:49.917,00:19:52.208,Ugh!
00:19:52.250,00:19:55.917,That tastes good.
00:19:55.959,00:19:57.667,"It's horrible, isn't it?"
00:19:57.709,00:19:59.041,"No, no!"
00:19:59.083,00:20:02.041,"Oh, we're making great progress."
00:20:02.083,00:20:03.792,"Here, try some of this."
00:20:06.417,00:20:08.417,Ah.
00:20:10.458,00:20:12.291,Bleh! Aaah!
00:20:13.417,00:20:16.333,-Whoa.
00:20:16.375,00:20:20.959,Okay. Just because everybody hates it doesn't mean it's not good.
00:20:21.000,00:20:23.291,"Listen, Gru."
00:20:23.333,00:20:26.792,There's something I've been meaning to talk to you about for some time now.
00:20:26.834,00:20:28.333,What?
00:20:28.375,00:20:33.792,Um-- I miss being evil.
00:20:33.834,00:20:38.166,"Sinister plots, large-scale crimes-- It's what I live for."
00:20:38.208,00:20:42.959,"I mean, don't you think there's more to our future than jelly?"
00:20:43.000,00:20:46.083,"Well, I'm also considering a line of jams."
00:20:47.000,00:20:52.834,"Um, the thing is, Gru, I've had an offer of employment elsewhere."
00:20:52.875,00:20:55.375,Dr. Nefario!
00:20:55.417,00:20:57.458,Come on.
00:20:57.500,00:21:05.250,"It's a great opportunity for me-- bigger lab, more evil, full dental."
00:21:13.375,00:21:18.041,Very well.
00:21:18.083,00:21:19.458,Minions!
00:21:23.750,00:21:26.583,The highest honor awarded...
00:21:26.625,00:21:28.542,to Dr. Nefario...
00:21:28.583,00:21:35.125,for your years of service-- the 21-fart-gun salute!
00:21:44.417,00:21:47.000,"Uh, I counted 22."
00:21:48.208,00:21:50.208,Ah.
00:21:51.917,00:21:54.542,"Farewell, my friends."
00:22:13.291,00:22:15.208,This may take a while.
00:22:15.250,00:22:17.500,Go about your business.
00:22:19.875,00:22:22.500,I miss you already.
00:22:52.667,00:22:54.917,Hmm? Oh. Hello.
00:23:03.500,00:23:05.208,Huh?
00:23:09.291,00:23:10.667,Hmm.
00:23:18.125,00:23:19.834,Are you sure we should be doing this?
00:23:19.875,00:23:22.083,"Yes, it's for his own good."
00:23:22.125,00:23:24.917,Okay. We need to choose a picture.
00:23:24.959,00:23:27.625,"Mmm, no. Scary."
00:23:27.667,00:23:29.083,Weird.
00:23:29.125,00:23:31.500,-What is that?
00:23:31.542,00:23:34.250,"Good morning, girls!"
00:23:34.291,00:23:36.375,"Hey, what celebrity do you look like?"
00:23:36.417,00:23:38.625,"Uh, Bruce Willis."
00:23:38.667,00:23:40.792,"Mmm, no."
00:23:40.834,00:23:44.041,Humpty Dumpty!
00:23:44.083,00:23:47.333,"-Okay, what are you doing?"
00:23:47.375,00:23:49.500,We're signing you up for online dating.
00:23:49.542,00:23:52.083,"Oh, okay. What?"
00:23:52.125,00:23:54.417,"Aw, come on."
00:23:54.458,00:23:57.000,And it's time for you to get out there.
00:23:57.041,00:23:58.667,No one is ever getting out there. Ever!
00:23:58.709,00:24:00.000,Ow!
00:24:00.041,00:24:02.792,Now for the announcement.
00:24:02.834,00:24:05.125,I have accepted a new job.
00:24:05.166,00:24:07.041,-Whoa. Really?
00:24:07.083,00:24:10.083,I have been recruited by a top-secret agency...
00:24:10.125,00:24:12.542,to go undercover and save the world.
00:24:12.583,00:24:16.083,-You're gonna be a spy?
00:24:16.125,00:24:20.500,"Gru's back in the game, with gadgets and weapons and cool cars."
00:24:20.542,00:24:23.000,-The whole deal.
00:24:23.041,00:24:25.166,Are you really gonna save the world?
00:24:25.208,00:24:26.709,Yes.
00:24:26.750,00:24:29.500,"Yes, I am."
00:24:29.542,00:24:31.166,Mocha!
00:24:31.208,00:24:34.083,Cacao!
00:24:34.125,00:24:36.000,Papadam? Eh?
00:24:48.291,00:24:53.750,Uh-- Huh?
00:24:59.375,00:25:01.125,Hmm.
00:25:01.917,00:25:03.542,Bake My Day.
00:25:04.625,00:25:06.125,Blech.
00:25:14.083,00:25:18.458,All right. Here is the cupcake recipe I got off the Internet.
00:25:22.250,00:25:24.375,And don't go nuts with the sprinkles!
00:25:37.792,00:25:39.333,Yah! Ha! Hoo!
00:25:39.375,00:25:42.667,Zah!
00:25:46.875,00:25:49.542,Whoo.
00:25:49.583,00:25:51.792,Or was I?
00:25:51.834,00:25:59.041,"Ooh, you-you got-- You got a-- a little-- Here, I'll-I'll get it."
00:25:59.083,00:26:02.500,Oh.
00:26:02.542,00:26:04.834,"All right, all right."
00:26:04.875,00:26:06.542,Oh!
00:26:06.583,00:26:09.125,-I'll let you get it.
00:26:09.166,00:26:13.041,"Yeah, what you just saw there was a little something new I've been working on."
00:26:13.083,00:26:22.291,"It's a combination of jujitsu, Krav Maga, Aztec warfare and-- Okay, that's weird."
00:26:22.333,00:26:26.208,On assignment from Silas.
00:26:26.250,00:26:28.875,What? No. No Yea.
00:26:28.917,00:26:31.917,Ramsbottom didn't say anything about a partner.
00:26:31.959,00:26:35.375,"Well, seems that because of your checkered past, everyone else refused to work with you."
00:26:35.417,00:26:38.166,But not me.
00:26:38.208,00:26:41.458,"And I'm new, so I kind of have to do what they tell me anyway."
00:26:41.500,00:26:43.083,Voilà!
00:26:47.125,00:26:49.750,-You know this guy?
00:26:49.792,00:26:51.709,"Yes, he's one of my minions."
00:26:51.750,00:26:54.083,"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:26:54.125,00:26:55.792,I should have known.
00:26:55.834,00:26:57.834,You're free to go.
00:27:02.917,00:27:04.291,Huh?
00:27:05.375,00:27:06.625,Ahh.
00:27:11.291,00:27:13.333,Oh.
00:27:13.375,00:27:14.709,Kanpai.
00:27:28.834,00:27:30.458,Oh.
00:27:30.500,00:27:32.750,Dave.
00:27:32.792,00:27:34.792,Earth to Dave!
00:27:34.834,00:27:37.250,-Huh?
00:27:37.291,00:27:48.500,"Oh, uh-- So, what do we got?"
00:27:48.542,00:27:50.041,Fire 'em at me.
00:27:50.083,00:27:55.583,"First suspect: Hedda Blumentoft, proprietor of Mum's the Word Floral Shop."
00:27:55.625,00:27:57.250,"No, not her."
00:27:57.291,00:28:01.792,Okay. Moving on.
00:28:03.417,00:28:05.166,Ooh.
00:28:05.208,00:28:07.000,-I don't think so.
00:28:10.417,00:28:13.834,-Mm-hmm.
00:28:13.875,00:28:20.041,"I am Eduardo Perez, owner of Salsa y Salsa restaurant across the mall."
00:28:20.083,00:28:22.291,Now open for breakfast.
00:28:22.333,00:28:24.500,And you are?
00:28:24.542,00:28:26.250,And we are closed.
00:28:26.291,00:28:28.333,This is just gonna take un momento.
00:28:28.375,00:28:35.125,"I am throwing a big Cinco de Mayo party, and I am going to need 200 of your best cupcakes..."
00:28:35.166,00:28:39.000,decorated with...
00:28:39.041,00:28:42.291,It looks something like this.
00:28:42.333,00:28:44.166,What do you think?
00:28:44.208,00:28:46.500,-Oh. Look away!
00:28:46.542,00:28:49.333,"Ooh, whoo."
00:28:49.375,00:28:51.458,"Anyway, I have to go."
00:28:51.500,00:28:54.250,I pick 'em up next week.
00:28:54.291,00:28:57.458,"Come by if you get a chance, okay?"
00:28:59.750,00:29:03.834,-And welcome to the mall family.
00:29:11.500,00:29:13.333,El Macho.
00:29:13.375,00:29:15.500,What?
00:29:15.542,00:29:17.041,What? What?
00:29:18.667,00:29:24.041,That guy looks exactly like a villain named El Macho...
00:29:24.083,00:29:25.875,from about 20 years ago.
00:29:28.125,00:29:30.041,Uh! Whoa!
00:29:32.125,00:29:35.125,He was ruthless!
00:29:35.166,00:29:38.917,"And as the name implies, very macho."
00:29:49.458,00:29:54.375,He had a reputation for pulling off heists using only his bare hands!
00:29:55.917,00:30:01.458,"Ah, but sadly, like all the greats, El Macho was gone too soon."
00:30:01.500,00:30:15.083,He died in the most macho way possible: riding a shark-- with 250 pounds of dynamite strapped to his chest-- into the mouth in an active volcano!
00:30:17.709,00:30:19.625,It was glorious.
00:30:20.959,00:30:24.583,"Yeah, sounds like El Macho's pretty dead."
00:30:24.625,00:30:27.125,They never found the body.
00:30:27.166,00:30:32.375,All that was ever retrieved was a pile of singed chest hair.
00:30:32.417,00:30:36.834,But that face!
00:30:36.875,00:30:40.667,Then what do you say you and I break into his restaurant tonight?
00:30:40.709,00:30:49.750,"Yes, that's good, because I'm telling you, if anybody in this place has the PX-41 serum, it's him."
00:30:52.333,00:30:55.375,"All right, all right."
00:30:55.417,00:30:57.375,-Time for bed.
00:30:57.417,00:30:59.458,I just-- I have a lot of work to do.
00:30:59.500,00:31:01.542,Work?
00:31:01.583,00:31:03.250,Very important business.
00:31:03.291,00:31:05.208,"So hugs, kisses."
00:31:05.250,00:31:09.417,Good night. Sleep tight.
00:31:09.458,00:31:12.959,But you said you'd help me practice my part for the Mother's Day show.
00:31:13.000,00:31:15.834,"Fine, fine."
00:31:15.875,00:31:17.583,Let me hear it. Quickly.
00:31:17.625,00:31:21.417,She kisses my boo-boos.
00:31:21.458,00:31:24.625,My mother is beyond compare.
00:31:24.667,00:31:27.917,"We love you, mothers, everywhere."
00:31:27.959,00:31:31.208,Wow!
00:31:31.250,00:31:34.375,I really liked the way you smiled at the end.
00:31:34.417,00:31:38.417,"Let's try this one more time, but a teensy bit less..."
00:31:38.458,00:31:41.458,"like a zombie, okay?"
00:31:41.500,00:31:43.166,Okay.
00:31:43.208,00:31:45.792,She kisses my boo-boos.
00:31:43.208,00:31:47.625,She braids my hair-- Perfect! Time to go.
00:31:47.667,00:31:50.166,I don't think I should do this.
00:31:50.208,00:31:52.625,"Well, what do you mean?"
00:31:52.667,00:31:54.041,I don't even have a mom.
00:31:55.417,00:31:57.959,"Well, you don't need one to do the show."
00:31:58.000,00:32:03.250,"I mean, you did the Veteran's Day pageant, and you haven't been in combat."
00:32:03.291,00:32:04.959,This is different.
00:32:05.000,00:32:10.125,"Okay, well, then maybe you can just use your imagination."
00:32:10.166,00:32:13.083,You mean I pretend I have a mom?
00:32:13.125,00:32:15.875,Yes. Right?
00:32:15.917,00:32:18.166,Yeah! I do that all the time.
00:32:18.208,00:32:20.166,"Thanks, Gru!"
00:32:22.583,00:32:24.125,Hey!
00:32:43.333,00:32:45.125,Yeah!
00:32:51.375,00:32:54.125,"All right. Hey, hey."
00:32:54.166,00:32:56.041,"Hey, please?"
00:32:56.083,00:32:59.000,"Kevin, Jerry, watch the girls for me, okay?"
00:32:59.041,00:33:01.417,"Dave, Stuart, come this way, with me."
00:33:01.458,00:33:02.834,Come on.
00:33:05.208,00:33:07.583,Come on!
00:33:33.709,00:33:35.834,Oh.
00:33:35.875,00:33:38.834,"Hey, putt-putt?"
00:33:40.959,00:33:42.208,Mm-hmm.
00:33:42.250,00:33:47.417,"Ah, doo-- Huh?"
00:34:24.834,00:34:26.375,Huh?
00:34:58.875,00:35:01.417,We're stealth ninjas.
00:35:01.458,00:35:04.875,We make no sound.
00:35:04.917,00:35:06.542,Yaah!
00:35:06.583,00:35:08.625,Ahh.
00:35:09.875,00:35:12.333,"All right, El Macho."
00:35:12.375,00:35:14.709,Wait! Wait.
00:35:15.792,00:35:17.417,What are you doing?
00:35:17.458,00:35:19.834,I'm checking for laser beam alarm triggers.
00:35:19.875,00:35:22.709,It's a restaurant!
00:35:22.750,00:35:25.208,You never know what kind of booby traps this guy could have set.
00:35:25.250,00:35:28.041,Huh? Come on.
00:35:28.083,00:35:31.000,-Ha! Booby!
00:35:41.417,00:35:43.834,Oh.
00:35:43.875,00:35:46.166,"Are you lost, little guy?"
00:35:46.208,00:35:48.291,You must be lost.
00:35:48.333,00:35:51.125,Some guard dog.
00:35:51.166,00:35:53.875,Whoo-hoo-hoo!
00:35:53.917,00:35:55.750,Get it off of me!
00:35:55.792,00:35:57.542,Get it off of me!
00:36:03.625,00:36:05.542,I got you!
00:36:11.000,00:36:12.375,I got it!
00:36:21.000,00:36:22.500,Ha!
00:36:24.250,00:36:26.792,-Oh!
00:36:31.792,00:36:34.917,Ugh.
00:36:34.959,00:36:37.750,"Hey, that pollo is loco."
00:36:37.792,00:36:40.750,No?
00:36:40.792,00:36:42.667,Okay. Let's go.
00:36:50.083,00:36:52.875,You getting anything?
00:36:52.917,00:36:57.000,"But, hey, maybe you can find something with these X-ray goggles."
00:36:58.750,00:37:00.250,Bah.
00:37:04.875,00:37:06.834,How are they working?
00:37:06.875,00:37:08.667,Ooh!
00:37:08.709,00:37:10.166,What's wrong?
00:37:10.208,00:37:13.333,"Oh, that's an image I'll never get out of my brain."
00:37:21.667,00:37:23.542,I knew it!
00:37:23.583,00:37:25.291,The serum is in here.
00:37:25.333,00:37:28.083,"Ooh, then let's get it."
00:37:28.125,00:37:30.917,Oh-ho!
00:37:30.959,00:37:32.458,Ah.
00:37:36.291,00:37:38.083,Aha!
00:37:38.125,00:37:39.250,What?
00:37:40.208,00:37:42.542,It's-- It's salsa?
00:37:42.583,00:37:44.208,"Aw, man."
00:37:50.208,00:37:53.291,Somebody's going to die tonight.
00:37:57.917,00:38:01.291,Pollito!
00:38:01.333,00:38:03.750,What did they do to you?
00:38:05.417,00:38:08.375,Who would do this to such a sweet little chicken?
00:38:08.417,00:38:10.333,What? Who's there?
00:38:10.375,00:38:12.166,Oh-oh.
00:38:12.208,00:38:13.875,"You coming out, or am I gonna go in?"
00:38:21.542,00:38:23.750,Huh?
00:38:23.792,00:38:25.166,Stop!
00:38:25.208,00:38:27.875,My eyes!
00:38:29.041,00:38:31.417,"Gru, call one of your munchkins!"
00:38:31.458,00:38:33.667,We've been spotted!
00:38:33.709,00:38:36.041,-Huh? Hey!
00:38:45.917,00:38:47.834,Oh. Subtle.
00:38:51.250,00:38:53.750,Over here!
00:38:53.792,00:38:56.500,Over... here.
00:39:03.291,00:39:04.625,Hold tight!
00:39:08.333,00:39:09.333,Aaah!
00:39:15.166,00:39:17.875,I have you now!
00:39:21.500,00:39:24.041,"Wow, wow."
00:39:51.750,00:39:54.625,Yea! Ice cream!
00:39:54.667,00:39:56.709,Hmm?
00:40:12.834,00:40:15.291,Gelato!
00:40:15.333,00:40:18.417,Hmm? Huh?
00:40:18.458,00:40:22.000,Gelato. Gelato. Gelato.
00:40:22.041,00:40:25.166,Gelato.
00:40:37.041,00:40:38.834,Ooh! Gelato.
00:40:38.875,00:40:40.458,Ahh. Oh.
00:40:52.041,00:40:54.125,All right.
00:40:54.166,00:40:57.250,Suspect number eight: Floyd Eaglesan.
00:40:57.291,00:41:00.667,-See if you can get closer.
00:41:11.959,00:41:13.083,All right.
00:41:14.125,00:41:17.834,"What the-- Oh, no."
00:41:20.041,00:41:21.458,Hey. What?
00:41:25.917,00:41:27.166,Aaah! Whoa!
00:41:28.542,00:41:29.834,Oof!
00:41:29.875,00:41:31.250,"Hey, Gru."
00:41:31.291,00:41:33.917,"Oh, girls!"
00:41:33.959,00:41:35.959,"Well, we thought we'd come visit you at work."
00:41:36.000,00:41:38.792,"So, you're saving the world in a garbage can?"
00:41:38.834,00:41:41.125,Funny.
00:41:41.166,00:41:44.792,Hey! There you are.
00:41:44.834,00:41:49.041,"Lucy, these are my girls, Margo, Edith and Agnes."
00:41:49.083,00:41:51.709,"Girls, Lucy."
00:41:51.750,00:41:53.166,Hello.
00:42:02.083,00:42:03.500,Are you single?
00:42:04.417,00:42:05.834,Oh! Goodness.
00:42:05.875,00:42:08.417,"Ah, hey!"
00:42:08.458,00:42:13.000,"Since Lucy and I have lots of work to do, why don't you girls go and explore the mall?"
00:42:13.041,00:42:16.041,Here is some money.
00:42:16.083,00:42:21.166,Some headbands and-- -Are you gonna marry Lucy?
00:42:21.208,00:42:23.792,No!
00:42:23.834,00:42:26.583,"Plus, you love her."
00:42:28.500,00:42:30.792,"Okay, stop."
00:42:30.834,00:42:33.083,I don't even like her.
00:42:34.625,00:42:36.458,Almost forgot.
00:42:36.500,00:42:38.166,Whoop!
00:42:38.208,00:42:41.583,Good luck saving the world. Bye.
00:42:43.709,00:42:46.375,"Kids, right?"
00:42:46.417,00:42:48.250,They're... funny.
00:42:48.291,00:42:50.291,Those girls totally adore you.
00:42:50.333,00:42:52.917,I bet you're a fun dad.
00:42:52.959,00:42:55.750,Huh. I am pretty fun.
00:43:04.834,00:43:06.750,Is that stealing?
00:43:06.792,00:43:09.208,Not if my wish was that I would get a lot of free coins.
00:43:37.125,00:43:39.500,Whoa!
00:43:39.542,00:43:42.083,Cool glasses.
00:43:42.125,00:43:44.083,Oh.
00:43:44.125,00:43:47.667,I'm Antonio.
00:43:47.709,00:43:50.083,I was just going to get a cookie.
00:43:50.125,00:43:53.750,Care to join me?
00:43:53.792,00:43:56.125,I'm Margo.
00:44:03.375,00:44:06.291,"Um, I'll catch up with you guys later."
00:44:06.333,00:44:07.709,Bye!
00:44:09.417,00:44:11.917,"Can I be the first to say, Ew?"
00:44:11.959,00:44:13.625,We gotta go tell Gru!
00:44:18.667,00:44:20.583,All right. I'm going in.
00:44:20.625,00:44:29.250,"If it picks up any traces of the serum, the sensor in your belt buckle will make a sound like this: -Mee-maw! Mee-maw!"
00:44:34.375,00:44:37.583,Welcome...
00:44:37.625,00:44:39.208,to Eagle Hair Club.
00:44:39.250,00:44:43.166,"It's about time you showed up, Mr. Gru."
00:44:44.667,00:44:46.750,You know my name?
00:44:48.542,00:44:55.125,"When someone moves into the mall who is folically challenged, I make it my business to know all about them."
00:44:55.166,00:44:58.083,"You are bald, and that is bad."
00:44:58.125,00:45:00.792,"There you go, my sweet."
00:45:00.834,00:45:04.208,I'm getting nothing so far.
00:45:12.083,00:45:15.166,"Wow, this looks interesting."
00:45:15.208,00:45:16.875,I take it you're an art lover?
00:45:16.917,00:45:19.041,No serum.
00:45:22.166,00:45:26.208,"Oh, how about this impressive trinket?"
00:45:26.250,00:45:28.291,"I'd hardly call it a trinket, Mr. Gru."
00:45:28.333,00:45:30.625,"The International-- Yeah, I don't care."
00:45:30.667,00:45:31.834,Mmm.
00:45:36.083,00:45:38.125,Mee-maw! Mee-maw!
00:45:38.166,00:45:40.166,Hold on.
00:45:40.208,00:45:42.208,"Ah, and what do we have here?"
00:45:42.250,00:45:45.291,These are my trial wigs.
00:45:45.333,00:45:48.583,"No, thanks. So, what's on the other side of the wall?"
00:45:48.625,00:45:51.792,-Here you are!
00:45:51.834,00:45:54.458,I promise that this wig will transform you...
00:45:54.500,00:45:59.667,from ugly to irresistible.
00:45:59.709,00:46:03.250,-Margo has a boyfriend!
00:46:03.291,00:46:06.208,Date? Boyfriend?
00:46:18.500,00:46:20.166,There she goes!
00:46:31.417,00:46:33.166,"Oh, you're so funny."
00:46:33.208,00:46:36.375,"Gross! Look, they're in love."
00:46:36.417,00:46:39.375,"Oh, no, no, no."
00:46:39.417,00:46:43.834,And my dream is to one day play video games for a living.
00:46:43.875,00:46:47.667,Wow.
00:46:47.709,00:46:49.417,Margo.
00:46:49.458,00:46:53.750,-What is going on here?
00:46:53.792,00:46:55.875,Me llamo Margo.
00:46:55.917,00:46:59.125,Me llama-lama ding-dong.
00:47:05.041,00:47:07.041,Yea!
00:47:29.917,00:47:32.667,Kids eat free on Tuesdays.
00:47:41.542,00:47:43.125,¡Epa!
00:47:43.166,00:47:46.375,That's awesome!
00:47:46.417,00:47:50.667,"So good to see you again, mi compadre."
00:47:50.709,00:47:52.834,"Oh, I see you have already met my father."
00:47:52.875,00:47:55.291,What the-- Father?
00:47:55.333,00:47:58.834,"Sí. Look at this crazy small world we live in, eh?"
00:47:58.875,00:48:00.792,"Come, sit."
00:48:02.583,00:48:04.959,"Oh, look at you."
00:48:05.000,00:48:08.083,He likes me.
00:48:08.125,00:48:10.250,"Oh, oh! I'm sorry."
00:48:10.291,00:48:12.834,Pollito's usually very friendly.
00:48:12.875,00:48:14.458,He had a rough night.
00:48:18.917,00:48:20.875,"Well, we really should be going."
00:48:20.917,00:48:22.959,That is a pity.
00:48:23.000,00:48:25.709,"Young love is beautiful, no?"
00:48:25.750,00:48:27.583,No!
00:48:27.625,00:48:30.667,"You know, they're not in love."
00:48:30.709,00:48:33.500,"You are right, cabeza de huevo."
00:48:33.542,00:48:36.166,They must get to know each other better.
00:48:36.208,00:48:40.333,"Antonio, why don't you invite your girlfriend and her family..."
00:48:40.375,00:48:42.041,to our Cinco de Mayo party?
00:48:42.083,00:48:44.667,"-No, no, I am-- - ¡Sí!"
00:48:58.875,00:49:01.583,I'm sorry. El Macho?
00:49:01.625,00:49:03.583,Hadn't we eliminated him as a suspect...
00:49:03.625,00:49:05.709,after the whole salsa incident?
00:49:05.750,00:49:11.667,"Yes, but there has been a new development, and I'm telling you, this is the guy."
00:49:11.709,00:49:14.125,You need to arrest him immediately.
00:49:14.166,00:49:17.625,And his deviously charming son!
00:49:17.667,00:49:20.667,I'm pretty sure that the son is involved too.
00:49:20.709,00:49:23.417,The son also.
00:49:23.458,00:49:26.709,I think that the son is the mastermind.
00:49:26.750,00:49:31.083,"There's a look-- There's a devilish look in his eyes, and I don't like it."
00:49:31.125,00:49:34.417,"-Yes, but I don't really see any evidence."
00:49:34.458,00:49:39.083,"I go with my gut, and my gut tells me that this guy is El Macho."
00:49:39.125,00:49:41.458,Lock him up.
00:49:41.500,00:49:42.917,Don't forget about the son.
00:49:42.959,00:49:45.625,The kid gives me the creeps.
00:49:45.667,00:49:47.709,"Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear."
00:49:47.750,00:49:55.959,"Uh, but, on the less-- crazy side of things, uh, Gru discovered traces of the serum at Eagle Hair Club."
00:49:56.000,00:49:58.250,Hmm. Interesting.
00:49:58.291,00:50:00.458,Yeah. And you know who made that happen?
00:50:00.500,00:50:02.083,Huh? This guy.
00:50:02.125,00:50:03.834,Nailed it.
00:50:03.875,00:50:05.542,"No-- I mean, sure."
00:50:05.583,00:50:07.792,But it's not him.
00:50:07.834,00:50:10.125,"Mr. Gru, please."
00:50:10.166,00:50:12.750,"No. It is him, and I will prove it."
00:50:14.750,00:50:16.333,"Gru, come on."
00:50:18.333,00:50:20.959,He really thinks it's El Macho.
00:50:21.000,00:50:23.291,Can you tell?
00:50:44.291,00:50:46.458,Hey!
00:50:48.583,00:50:50.166,Hoo!
00:50:53.667,00:50:55.458,Mm-hmm.
00:51:15.667,00:51:17.417,All right!
00:51:27.000,00:51:28.667,Gimme that!
00:51:36.125,00:51:39.500,"Kevin, the Wi-Fi's out."
00:51:39.542,00:51:41.250,Kevin?
00:51:41.291,00:51:43.667,"Hey, Lance, where the heck is Kevin?"
00:51:45.500,00:51:49.417,"All right, we need to revisit the number of vacation days you guys get."
00:51:49.458,00:51:51.709,I can't find anybody anymore.
00:51:51.750,00:51:55.000,"Gru, it's Jillian."
00:51:55.041,00:51:57.709,I've got good news.
00:51:57.750,00:52:00.083,I have my friend Shannon here with me.
00:52:00.125,00:52:02.166,I was thinking you two could get some grub.
00:52:02.208,00:52:04.291,"You know, tear it up, see what happens."
00:52:05.834,00:52:07.875,"Uh, open up."
00:52:07.917,00:52:09.875,Agnes. Agnes.
00:52:09.917,00:52:11.208,Tell Jillian I'm not here.
00:52:12.125,00:52:13.542,Gru's not here.
00:52:13.583,00:52:15.583,Are you sure?
00:52:15.625,00:52:17.083,"Yes, he just told me."
00:52:17.125,00:52:19.125,Mm-mmm.
00:52:19.166,00:52:21.875,"I mean, no."
00:52:21.917,00:52:25.125,"Agnes, where is Gru?"
00:52:25.166,00:52:28.250,-He's putting on lipstick.
00:52:28.291,00:52:31.375,-He's swatting at flies.
00:52:31.417,00:52:33.875,-No. No.
00:52:35.875,00:52:38.083,He's... pooping?
00:52:39.375,00:52:41.250,"I know you're in there, Gru."
00:52:41.291,00:52:44.583,There's no way you're getting out of this.
00:52:49.792,00:52:53.333,"I have to tell you, I was so nervous about tonight."
00:52:53.375,00:52:56.375,"I mean, there's just so many phonies out there."
00:52:57.417,00:53:00.041,"Yes, I hear you."
00:53:00.083,00:53:03.208,"So, do you work out?"
00:53:03.250,00:53:06.959,"Well-- I mean, obviously, you don't."
00:53:07.000,00:53:10.583,Huh? Physical fitness is very important to Shannon.
00:53:10.625,00:53:12.250,"As you can tell, right?"
00:53:13.959,00:53:16.333,Ah. I can tell.
00:53:16.375,00:53:19.667,Solid.
00:53:21.458,00:53:23.500,Hi.
00:53:23.542,00:53:25.166,Sure. Just a sec.
00:53:37.166,00:53:39.458,Your accent is so exotic.
00:53:39.500,00:53:42.041,"Ah. Well, thank you very much."
00:53:42.083,00:53:44.125,I was-- I know someone who can fix that for you.
00:53:44.166,00:53:47.000,You'll be talking normal in no time.
00:53:48.875,00:53:51.583,Whoo. Is it hot in here?
00:53:53.667,00:53:55.208,How's the food?
00:53:56.417,00:53:57.834,Wait a minute.
00:53:57.875,00:53:59.959,Are you wearing a wig?
00:54:00.000,00:54:01.500,What?
00:54:01.542,00:54:04.750,Ah! I don't think so.
00:54:04.792,00:54:06.834,You're a phony.
00:54:06.875,00:54:09.291,"Oh, what? No."
00:54:09.333,00:54:12.083,"No, they're not."
00:54:12.125,00:54:13.750,I'm gonna rip that thing off your head...
00:54:13.792,00:54:16.750,and show everyone what a bald-headed phony you are.
00:54:16.792,00:54:18.875,"-I don't think so, Miss Lady."
00:54:27.667,00:54:29.875,Hello. Hello?
00:54:29.917,00:54:31.583,"Are you-- Hey, Gru."
00:54:31.625,00:54:35.166,"Hello, Lucy."
00:54:35.208,00:54:37.166,Wow. Looks like your date's out for the count.
00:54:37.208,00:54:40.166,It's like she's been shot with a mild moose tranquilizer.
00:54:45.959,00:54:49.166,"Yeah, I'm winking 'cause that's what actually happened."
00:54:49.208,00:54:50.875,Scusi.
00:54:50.917,00:54:52.625,She no like?
00:54:52.667,00:54:56.667,"Oh, she's just, uh-- Oh!"
00:54:56.709,00:54:58.166,"Sì, sì."
00:54:58.208,00:55:00.250,"Well, shall we take her home?"
00:55:02.750,00:55:04.083,Oh.
00:55:43.083,00:55:46.417,"Well, I think you did it."
00:55:46.458,00:55:49.166,"Oh, tell me about it."
00:55:49.208,00:55:51.667,It can only get better from here. Right?
00:55:51.709,00:55:53.792,"But if it doesn't, you can always borrow my dart gun."
00:55:53.834,00:55:56.083,Had to use it on one or two dates myself.
00:55:56.125,00:56:01.083,"Yeah, you know, as far as dates go, I think I'm good with just the one."
00:56:04.917,00:56:07.667,"Well, good night, partner."
00:56:10.166,00:56:11.834,This was fun.
00:56:11.875,00:56:14.291,Yes.
00:56:14.333,00:56:17.208,"Oh, and, uh, just between you and me?"
00:56:17.959,00:56:20.083,You look much better bald.
00:56:22.041,00:56:23.500,See you tomorrow.
00:56:37.250,00:56:38.834,Oh! Oh! Oh!
00:56:38.875,00:56:40.834,Yeah!
00:56:40.875,00:56:42.625,So I take it the date went well?
00:56:42.667,00:56:45.291,"No, it was horrible."
00:56:55.417,00:56:57.041,High-five!
00:57:07.792,00:57:08.959,Oh!
00:57:42.834,00:57:44.583,Mr. Ramsbottom?
00:57:44.625,00:57:47.458,"Oh, hello."
00:57:47.500,00:57:49.458,We got him.
00:57:49.500,00:57:51.500,Floyd Eaglesan.
00:57:51.542,00:57:56.375,"Our agents located a secret room in his shop last night and, uh, discovered this."
00:57:56.417,00:58:00.250,"It's empty, but we found traces of the PX-41 serum in it."
00:58:00.291,00:58:02.041,He's our man.
00:58:02.083,00:58:06.417,"So, somehow, in spite of your incompetence, we solved this one."
00:58:06.458,00:58:07.959,I was framed!
00:58:08.000,00:58:09.959,You won't get away with this.
00:58:10.000,00:58:11.667,Get your mitts off of me!
00:58:11.709,00:58:13.667,I am a legitimate businessman!
00:58:13.709,00:58:16.250,All right. So what now?
00:58:16.291,00:58:19.375,"Well, now you're free to go back to your business."
00:58:19.417,00:58:22.208,Mmm. Jams and jellies.
00:58:22.250,00:58:25.917,And it looks like Agent Wilde will be transferring to our Australian branch.
00:58:26.792,00:58:29.250,Australia?
00:58:29.291,00:58:31.375,But thank you for everything.
00:58:31.417,00:58:34.166,"And by everything, of course, I mean nothing."
00:58:34.208,00:58:36.542,"Toodle pip and cheerio, Mr. Gru."
00:58:40.625,00:58:42.333,Hey there.
00:58:42.375,00:58:44.667,Hey.
00:58:44.709,00:58:48.250,Yea. That's great.
00:58:48.291,00:58:50.083,And now you're going to Australia?
00:58:50.125,00:58:53.083,"Well, it's not definite yet."
00:58:53.125,00:58:54.834,Already been working on my accent.
00:58:54.875,00:58:57.375,Wallaby. Didgeridoo.
00:58:57.417,00:59:00.583,Hugh Jackman.
00:59:00.625,00:59:04.000,"So, um, pretty excited."
00:59:04.792,00:59:06.458,Great.
00:59:06.500,00:59:09.000,"Well, good luck."
00:59:09.041,00:59:11.166,Thanks. You too.
00:59:12.625,00:59:15.125,Oh. Here. I-- I wanted to give you this.
00:59:15.166,00:59:17.375,Your lipstick Taser?
00:59:17.417,00:59:19.333,"Yeah, it's just a memento."
00:59:19.375,00:59:23.166,"Just, you know, from the first time we met."
00:59:23.208,00:59:26.625,"Oh. Thank you, Lucy."
00:59:26.667,00:59:28.750,Agent Wilde.
00:59:28.792,00:59:34.166,"Well, it looks like they need you, so-- Yeah, I, uh-- I better go."
00:59:35.500,00:59:37.125,"Bye, Gru."
00:59:51.250,00:59:52.625,Whoa.
00:59:56.542,00:59:57.625,Aaah!
00:59:57.667,00:59:58.417,Aaah!
00:59:58.458,00:59:59.458,Mmm!
01:00:13.458,01:00:15.667,I brought you an umbrella.
01:00:19.333,01:00:21.750,Ah. Thank you.
01:00:23.041,01:00:27.542,Remember when you said that I liked Lucy?
01:00:27.583,01:00:31.417,"Well, it turns out you were right."
01:00:32.417,01:00:34.875,Really?
01:00:32.417,01:00:38.500,"Yes, but-- Well, she's moving away."
01:00:38.542,01:00:40.875,I'm never going to see her again.
01:00:44.333,01:00:46.709,Is there anything I can do to help?
01:00:46.750,01:00:51.083,"Uh, I don't-- I don't think so, sweetheart."
01:00:52.333,01:00:54.709,"Well, is there anything you could do?"
01:00:56.333,01:00:59.083,"Hello, Lucy."
01:00:59.125,01:01:12.667,"I know up to this point our relationship has been strictly professional, and you're leaving for Australia and all, but-- Okay, here is the question."
01:01:12.709,01:01:18.083,Would you like to-- to go out on a date?
01:01:19.625,01:01:21.208,"Uh, no."
01:01:21.250,01:01:23.208,"Okay, that's not helping."
01:01:23.250,01:01:26.041,"All right, here we go."
01:01:36.458,01:01:37.834,I can do this.
01:01:55.750,01:01:57.250,Aaah! I hate you!
01:02:01.208,01:02:02.625,Ah.
01:02:09.750,01:02:11.542,"Bee-doh, bee-doh!"
01:02:21.834,01:02:30.875,"Bee-doh, bee-doh, bee-doh, bee-- Bee-doh, bee-doh-- Aaah!"
01:02:48.667,01:02:51.291,Oh! Oh! Ah!

01:03:06.750,01:03:08.834,Eh? Kanpai!
01:03:08.875,01:03:10.750,Huh?
01:03:19.500,01:03:21.166,Bah!
01:03:24.583,01:03:26.250,Oh.
01:03:28.417,01:03:30.917,Cinco de Mayo!

01:03:41.500,01:03:43.125,This place is awesome!
01:03:46.500,01:03:48.542,"Okay. Let's party, huh?"
01:03:48.583,01:03:51.333,"But first, let's go over the rules."
01:03:51.375,01:03:54.500,Because what is fun without the rules?
01:03:54.542,01:03:56.250,"Agnes, easy on the churros."
01:03:56.291,01:03:58.709,"Edith, try not to kill anyone."
01:03:58.750,01:04:01.166,"Margo-- Hello, Mr. Gru."
01:04:01.208,01:04:02.458,Okay.
01:04:03.375,01:04:05.000,Gru!
01:04:05.041,01:04:09.333,There must be the standard six feet of space between you and boys.
01:04:09.375,01:04:11.083,Especially this boy.
01:04:12.583,01:04:14.667,"Ah, you are a funny man."
01:04:14.709,01:04:16.250,"There are no rules, señor."
01:04:16.291,01:04:18.000,It's Cinco de Mayo.
01:04:18.041,01:04:19.667,They're starting the dance.
01:04:19.709,01:04:21.709,¡Arriba!
01:05:05.083,01:05:22.125,"Let's mix it So glad you could make it, mi compadre."
01:05:23.667,01:05:27.041,"Hey, what's wrong?"
01:05:27.083,01:05:30.041,I'm just chilling with the guac...
01:05:30.083,01:05:32.125,from my chip hat.
01:05:33.875,01:05:35.750,"Gru, please."
01:05:35.792,01:05:38.333,I know that look all too well.
01:05:38.375,01:05:40.333,It is the look of a broken heart.
01:05:40.375,01:05:41.792,How did you know?
01:05:41.834,01:05:45.709,"Believe me, my friend, I too have spent many nights..."
01:05:45.750,01:05:48.875,trying to drown my sorrows in guacamole.
01:05:48.917,01:05:50.208,You?
01:05:50.250,01:05:52.250,Yes. Mmm.
01:05:52.291,01:05:55.458,But we are survivors.
01:05:55.500,01:06:00.083,"There's much more to us than meets the eye, hmm?"
01:06:00.125,01:06:02.166,Enjoy the party.
01:06:52.709,01:06:54.583,What the-- Oh!
01:06:55.500,01:06:57.125,Huh.
01:07:18.125,01:07:19.792,Aha!
01:07:19.834,01:07:22.667,"Ha, ha, ha!"
01:07:22.709,01:07:24.083,Ouch.
01:07:30.333,01:07:31.709,Hmm.
01:07:41.250,01:07:42.667,Say what?
01:07:55.417,01:07:59.125,Would you like some peanuts or pretzels?
01:08:00.959,01:08:05.000,That's a good joke.
01:08:09.375,01:08:11.542,I just did a boom-boom.
01:08:13.250,01:08:15.250,"I really need you to make a choice, hon."
01:08:16.750,01:08:18.041,I choose Gru.
01:08:19.125,01:08:21.083,I choose Gru!
01:08:25.083,01:08:26.750,"Thank you, Gru stewardess!"
01:08:26.792,01:08:28.792,You're welcome.
01:09:02.208,01:09:05.792,"You have not lost your touch, my friend."
01:09:05.834,01:09:08.375,Aha! I knew it.
01:09:08.417,01:09:12.125,-You are El Macho.
01:09:12.166,01:09:13.875,Nobody believed me!
01:09:13.917,01:09:16.000,"Ho, ho. But I knew you weren't dead."
01:09:16.041,01:09:18.208,Of course not.
01:09:18.250,01:09:21.250,I merely faked my death.
01:09:21.291,01:09:23.792,"But now, it's time for me..."
01:09:23.834,01:09:28.000,to make a spectacular return to evil.
01:09:28.041,01:09:31.709,"Doctor, I think it's time we showed Gru..."
01:09:31.750,01:09:33.792,what we're up to here.
01:09:33.834,01:09:35.709,Dr. Nefario?
01:09:35.750,01:09:38.208,"Nice to see you, Gru."
01:09:38.250,01:09:42.709,Wha-- So this is your new job opportunity?
01:09:42.750,01:09:44.625,Absolutely.
01:09:44.667,01:09:46.333,You're gonna like this.
01:09:50.500,01:09:56.041,"Sorry. I had to borrow some of your minions, but it was for a worthy cause."
01:09:56.083,01:09:58.917,Ooh. Kevin. Ugh.
01:09:58.959,01:10:01.625,"No, he's not Kevin anymore."
01:10:01.667,01:10:06.667,"Now he is an indestructible, mindless killing machine."
01:10:06.709,01:10:07.583,Bah!
01:10:07.625,01:10:09.583,Just watch this.

01:10:40.792,01:10:42.250,Bah!
01:10:42.291,01:10:54.083,"Soon I will unleash them on the world, and if anyone-- anyone tries to stop them-- Yeow!"
01:10:54.792,01:10:56.458,We can do it together.
01:10:56.500,01:10:59.333,-Together?
01:10:59.375,01:11:02.500,"I have admired your work for years, amigo."
01:11:02.542,01:11:04.458,Stealing the moon?
01:11:04.500,01:11:05.917,Are you kidding?
01:11:05.959,01:11:08.208,We would be unstoppable.
01:11:08.250,01:11:15.208,"Men like you, men like me-- we should be ruling the world!"
01:11:15.250,01:11:16.917,"So, are you in?"
01:11:16.959,01:11:18.166,Whoo-hoo!
01:11:19.125,01:11:20.875,"Uh, yeah, probably."
01:11:20.917,01:11:22.750,Probably?
01:11:22.792,01:11:25.625,"I mean, yes. Yes."
01:11:25.667,01:11:28.417,I just have a lot going on right now.
01:11:28.458,01:11:31.125,I just need to get some things off my plate...
01:11:31.166,01:11:34.500,"before we start taking over the world, that's all."
01:11:34.542,01:11:36.500,Excuse me?
01:11:36.542,01:11:40.166,One hundred percent I am in.
01:11:40.208,01:11:43.250,I think-- What is-- Do you hear that?
01:11:43.291,01:11:46.166,That's Agnes calling me from on the surface.
01:11:49.709,01:11:51.083,Totally in.
01:11:52.709,01:11:54.417,You know what?
01:11:54.458,01:11:56.834,I'm not so convinced that he is in.
01:11:57.709,01:12:00.458,Bah!
01:12:08.834,01:12:10.375,"Edith, Agnes, come on."
01:12:10.417,01:12:12.083,Oops. Sorry.
01:12:12.125,01:12:13.834,We need to go home now.
01:12:13.875,01:12:15.250,But I didn't get a turn.
01:12:22.291,01:12:24.166,Margo. Come on.
01:12:24.208,01:12:27.458,"We're lea-- Hey, what's wrong?"
01:12:27.500,01:12:28.875,I hate boys.
01:12:31.917,01:12:34.875,Yes. They stink.
01:12:34.917,01:12:36.583,"Honey, we got to go."
01:12:58.542,01:13:01.000,Oops. Sorry.
01:13:06.125,01:13:08.125,Yah!
01:13:12.834,01:13:16.875,"Hey, Pollito-- what's the matter?"
01:13:16.917,01:13:18.792,"Lucia, I apologize."
01:13:18.834,01:13:21.834,"Pollito, he's usually not like this."
01:13:21.875,01:13:31.291,"The same thing happened the other day with-- with Gru, and-- Oh. Well, speaking of Gru, um, have you seen him?"
01:13:31.333,01:13:33.000,I really need to talk to him.
01:13:33.041,01:13:35.834,Yes. I think he's somewhere around here.
01:13:35.875,01:13:38.208,"You two are close, no?"
01:13:38.250,01:13:40.166,"Oh, I don't know."
01:13:40.208,01:13:43.166,"I mean, close-- I wouldn't say we were close."
01:13:43.208,01:13:45.250,Why? did he say we were close?
01:13:45.291,01:13:48.166,It's more what he didn't say.
01:13:48.208,01:13:51.333,"For instance, he never mentioned..."
01:13:51.375,01:13:54.500,that you were both working for the Anti-Villain League.
01:13:54.542,01:13:57.250,You're coming with me.
01:13:57.291,01:13:58.500,Hey!
01:13:59.458,01:14:01.125,Crikey.
01:14:06.750,01:14:10.000,So Eduardo's actually El Macho?
01:14:10.041,01:14:12.375,Cool.
01:14:12.417,01:14:16.542,"Plus, I pretty much knew it was him all along, so if anyone's cool, it's me."
01:14:18.875,01:14:22.166,- Gru.
01:14:22.208,01:14:23.542,El Macho's onto you.
01:14:23.583,01:14:25.291,He knows you're working for the A.V.L.
01:14:25.333,01:14:27.291,And he's got your partner.
01:14:27.333,01:14:30.583,Lucy?
01:14:30.625,01:14:32.375,She's on her way to Australia.
01:14:32.417,01:14:34.041,Nefario?
01:14:35.291,01:14:38.041,He's got Lucy?
01:14:39.041,01:14:40.917,Not for long.
01:14:40.959,01:14:43.375,Come on.
01:15:26.792,01:15:29.250,Bah!
01:15:46.208,01:15:48.041,Huh?
01:16:11.667,01:16:13.333,What was that?
01:16:25.000,01:16:26.834,I don't see anything.
01:16:39.083,01:16:42.291,-Run!
01:16:42.333,01:16:44.500,-My unicorn.
01:17:18.750,01:17:19.542,Come on! Hurry!
01:17:19.583,01:17:21.375,Whoa.
01:17:24.000,01:17:25.792,What's the matter?
01:17:25.834,01:17:27.667,-Aaah!
01:17:30.709,01:17:32.125,Bah!
01:17:37.792,01:17:41.000,Huh?
01:17:42.583,01:17:43.959,Oh là là.
01:17:45.709,01:17:47.500,Kevin!
01:17:47.542,01:17:49.625,Kevin!
01:17:49.667,01:17:51.542,"Dr. Nefario, you're back."
01:17:51.583,01:17:53.542,In the flesh.
01:17:53.583,01:17:58.083,Behold-- the antidote.
01:18:00.667,01:18:04.125,Come on. Let's finally put this horrible jelly to some good use.
01:18:18.875,01:18:20.333,Hey! Guys.
01:18:20.375,01:18:22.166,"Come on, stay focused here."
01:18:22.208,01:18:24.250,Okay. Okay.
01:18:33.041,01:18:34.250,Hmm?
01:18:34.291,01:18:36.333,Huh?
01:18:39.041,01:19:07.000,Um-- Uh-- Uh-- Curses! Foiled again.
01:19:07.041,01:19:09.583,These guys captured me.
01:19:34.917,01:19:37.125,Blah! Ugh.
01:19:37.959,01:19:40.166,-Huh?
01:19:41.709,01:19:45.250,Uh-- No?
01:19:58.834,01:20:00.750,Up that tree!
01:20:00.792,01:20:02.041,Hurry. Hurry.
01:20:07.375,01:20:08.750,Aaah!
01:20:10.417,01:20:12.375,Run!
01:20:16.709,01:20:18.083,Up!
01:20:32.667,01:20:34.250,Bah!
01:20:35.166,01:20:36.458,Aaah!
01:20:39.291,01:20:40.333,Huh?
01:20:40.375,01:20:42.000,Bah!
01:20:57.333,01:20:58.709,Bah!
01:21:01.000,01:21:03.000,Oh! Aaah! Aaah!
01:21:03.041,01:21:04.959,"Hello, Gru!"
01:21:05.000,01:21:08.375,"Nice work, Dr. Nefario."
01:21:08.417,01:21:10.750,I put an antidote in the jelly.
01:21:10.792,01:21:17.917,"I mean, I'm happy to create an evil army to destroy the world, but nobody messes with my family."
01:21:17.959,01:21:20.125,"Thank you, Doctor."
01:21:20.166,01:21:24.583,"Now, let's go get the-- Hi."
01:21:24.625,01:21:26.667,You brought the girls?
01:21:26.709,01:21:30.041,"Yes. Oh, was that wrong?"
01:21:40.625,01:21:42.875,What's happening to my minions?
01:21:42.917,01:21:43.917,Gru?
01:21:46.291,01:21:48.834,"You guys, take care of the rest of the minions."
01:21:48.875,01:21:50.709,I'm going to find Lucy.
01:22:01.792,01:22:03.750,"Eat jelly, you purple freaks."
01:22:03.792,01:22:05.625,Aaah! Aaah!
01:22:09.709,01:22:11.000,Aaah!
01:22:33.083,01:22:35.083,"It's over, El Macho."
01:22:35.125,01:22:37.500,Now where is Lucy?
01:22:37.542,01:22:38.917,Let me show you.
01:22:51.667,01:22:53.333,"Oh. Hey, Gru."
01:22:53.375,01:22:56.000,"Turns out you were right about the whole El Macho thing, huh?"
01:22:56.041,01:22:58.083,Yea.
01:22:58.125,01:23:02.458,"One push of this button, and I send that rocket..."
01:23:02.500,01:23:06.917,straight into the same volcano where I faked my death.
01:23:06.959,01:23:09.667,"Only this time, it's for real."
01:23:09.709,01:23:10.625,No.
01:23:11.375,01:23:12.750,Ah!
01:23:12.792,01:23:14.125,Tallyho!
01:23:15.792,01:23:17.458,Aaah!
01:23:21.417,01:23:24.709,"We could have ruled the world together, Gru."
01:23:25.709,01:23:29.667,But now-- you're gonna die.
01:23:51.917,01:23:54.083,Oh.
01:24:08.625,01:24:10.709,Aaah!
01:24:10.750,01:24:12.917,Huh!
01:24:13.750,01:24:15.500,Aaah!
01:24:25.667,01:24:26.542,Ooh!
01:24:41.291,01:24:44.000,Lipstick Taser!
01:24:44.041,01:24:46.083,"Aw, he copied me."
01:24:52.583,01:24:57.083,I am not afraid-- of your jelly guns.
01:24:57.125,01:25:00.083,"Oh, this ain't a jelly gun, sunshine."
01:25:08.458,01:25:10.083,Oh!
01:25:13.375,01:25:16.625,"Don't worry about me, Gru."
01:25:16.667,01:25:19.125,I have survived lots worse than this.
01:25:19.166,01:25:21.125,"Okay, that's not entirely true."
01:25:21.166,01:25:22.917,I'm actually kind of freaking out up here.
01:25:22.959,01:25:24.792,Don't worry.
01:25:33.417,01:25:36.208,I really hate that chicken.
01:25:39.083,01:25:40.375,Aaah!
01:25:51.542,01:25:53.458,Aaah!
01:26:00.750,01:26:02.542,Is there a red one?
01:26:05.417,01:26:08.000,"Gru, any time now."
01:26:08.041,01:26:10.125,Ooh!
01:26:10.166,01:26:14.500,"Listen, Lucy, we may not get out of this alive, so I need to ask you a question."
01:26:14.542,01:26:15.917,"Uh, better make it quick."
01:26:17.041,01:26:19.917,"If I'd asked you out on a date, what would you have said?"
01:26:19.959,01:26:22.667,Are you kidding me? Yes.
01:26:24.166,01:26:26.125,Oh! Jump!
01:26:31.750,01:26:33.125,Aaah!
01:26:38.709,01:26:40.750,Lucy!
01:26:40.792,01:26:43.125,"Lucy, where are you?"
01:26:44.875,01:26:47.375,"Oh, Lucy."
01:26:48.458,01:26:49.208,Gru!
01:26:52.834,01:26:54.834,Sorry.
01:26:54.875,01:26:57.375,"Guess you kind of need your arms to tread water, huh?"
01:27:06.250,01:27:08.041,They'll be back.
01:28:12.583,01:28:13.625,Oh!
01:28:19.166,01:28:22.291,"Can I be the first to say, Ew?"
01:28:41.417,01:28:43.041,Okay.
01:28:43.792,01:28:46.291,Excuse me.
01:28:46.333,01:28:48.834,"Um, hi. Excuse me."
01:28:56.000,01:29:01.792,"Uh-- Hi, everybody."
01:29:04.333,01:29:05.709,Okay.
01:29:06.792,01:29:10.583,"She, um-- She, um, kisses my boo-boos."
01:29:10.625,01:29:12.458,She braids my hair.
01:29:12.500,01:29:15.375,"We love you, mothers, everywhere."
01:29:15.417,01:29:19.166,"And my new mom, Lucy, is beyond compare."
01:29:19.208,01:29:20.458,Aww.
01:29:20.500,01:29:21.542,Oh.
01:29:28.792,01:29:30.959,To the bride and Gru.
01:29:56.542,01:29:57.875,Yeah!
01:30:04.125,01:30:06.542,Whoo-hoo!
01:30:30.208,01:30:31.208,Bah!
01:30:51.667,01:30:53.709,"Hey, Bob, Stuart."
01:30:58.291,01:30:59.875,Mmm? Mmm? Mmm?
01:31:03.375,01:31:05.834,Hmm?
01:31:12.709,01:31:14.083,Huh?
01:31:28.208,01:31:30.166,No? Oh. Huh.
01:31:35.333,01:31:36.458,Bob.
01:31:44.125,01:31:46.250,Uh-oh.
01:31:57.875,01:32:00.500,Okay.
01:32:00.542,01:32:02.625,Go.
01:32:05.583,01:32:06.917,Oh.
01:32:06.959,01:32:09.125,Bob!
01:32:12.834,01:32:14.625,Aaah!
01:32:29.667,01:32:30.834,Okay.
01:32:30.875,01:32:33.000,"Uno, dos, tres."
01:33:11.709,01:33:13.959,Bob.
01:33:28.583,01:33:30.458,Oh.
01:33:40.083,01:33:41.417,"Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh."
01:33:45.291,01:33:47.291,Ah-- Bob!
