00:40:38.060,00:40:39.645,"Exactly, Peppino."
00:40:39.728,00:40:42.356,-I fixed it last week. -Peppino...
00:40:42.565,00:40:43.607,-I broke it? -Yes.
00:40:43.691,00:40:44.733,I broke it?
00:40:44.817,00:40:46.360,"-Yes, you. -No."
00:40:46.444,00:40:48.279,-Be quiet. You broke it! -It wasn't me!
00:40:48.404,00:40:49.530,Fuck off both of you!
00:40:50.823,00:40:52.700,"Okay, I'm sorry, but move this van!"
00:40:52.908,00:40:54.577,Just a moment!
00:40:54.743,00:40:56.495,"This is a mess for us, too!"
00:40:56.579,00:40:57.997,"Move it behind, so we can pass."
00:40:58.080,00:40:59.790,"-Stop! -Move quickly, come on!"
00:41:07.506,00:41:08.883,Sorry!
00:41:08.966,00:41:10.509,The car is broken!
00:41:51.550,00:41:53.969,Everything is perfect.
00:41:54.053,00:41:56.388,"Okay, no problem. Bye."
00:41:56.639,00:41:57.640,Have a nice day.
00:45:56.044,00:45:57.546,Miss Onia Demea.
00:45:57.713,00:45:59.673,I should be on the list. Thank you.
00:46:01.341,00:46:02.676,I'm sorry. Your name is not here.
00:46:02.759,00:46:04.219,There must be a mistake.
00:46:04.887,00:46:06.138,Excuse me!
00:46:13.687,00:46:14.521,Miss Demea?
00:46:15.939,00:46:16.815,Just a minute.
01:06:34.991,01:06:37.952,Turn the drone around. There's an IMF agent in the truck.
01:15:20.098,01:15:22.100,I intercepted Davian's call.
01:15:22.184,01:15:24.853,I know he wants the Rabbit's Foot for Julia's life.
01:15:32.819,01:15:36.365,Go to Shanghai. Feng Shan Apartments -- 1406.
00:00:37.871,00:00:39.039,Does that sound familiar?
00:00:42.834,00:00:44.252,The Rabbit's Foot. Where is it?
00:00:46.045,00:00:47.172,I gave it to you.
00:00:47.839,00:00:50.759,"Ethan, where's the Rabbit's Foot?"
00:00:51.551,00:00:54.721,"Wait. What, what are you saying? That wasn't it?"
00:00:55.346,00:00:57.015,"-What I gave you, was that-- -I'm going to count to ten."
00:00:58.600,00:01:01.936,You're going to tell me where the Rabbit's Foot is or she dies.
00:01:10.820,00:01:13.031,"Jules, it's going to be okay."
00:01:14.365,00:01:15.950,It's going to be okay. Do you understand?
00:01:17.952,00:01:18.870,One.
00:01:19.370,00:01:20.330,You listen to me.
00:01:21.122,00:01:22.582,I got exactly what you asked for.
00:01:22.665,00:01:23.750,Did you want something else?
00:01:25.460,00:01:27.086,"If there was a misunderstanding, I will fix it."
00:01:27.170,00:01:28.630,"I can get it, whatever you want."
00:01:29.172,00:01:30.089,Two.
00:01:31.049,00:01:35.595,"Listen. Talk to me. We, we can talk, like gentlemen."
00:01:37.680,00:01:39.599,-Three. -God!
00:01:46.981,00:01:47.816,Okay.
00:01:49.109,00:01:51.361,"All right. All right, all right."
00:01:53.154,00:01:54.697,I know where the Rabbit's Foot is.
00:01:56.783,00:01:57.826,I can help you.
00:01:58.076,00:01:59.869,The way you helped me on the airplane?
00:02:01.204,00:02:02.288,That way?
00:02:03.206,00:02:05.416,You put the gun down. I'm not talking to you like this.
00:02:05.583,00:02:08.044,That's your choice. Four.
00:02:09.587,00:02:10.713,The Rabbit's Foot's in Paris.
00:02:11.256,00:02:13.675,You want to know where in Paris? Then let her go.
00:02:13.967,00:02:15.844,-'Cause you will not-- -It's not in Paris. Five.
00:02:19.013,00:02:20.223,I can get it for you.
00:02:20.890,00:02:22.725,"But you kill her, you do this, you get nothing."
00:02:22.809,00:02:24.352,-Six. -Are you listening to me?
00:02:25.145,00:02:30.525,The only way you're going to get what you want is for you to-- -Do you think I'm playing? -Son of a bitch!
00:02:30.608,00:02:32.819,Do you think I'm playing? You don't think I'll do it?
00:02:32.902,00:02:34.904,Where is it? Where the hell is it?
00:02:34.988,00:02:36.239,-Look at me. -Where the hell is it?
00:02:36.322,00:02:38.908,-Look at me. Stay with me. -Seven! Seven!
00:02:38.992,00:02:40.952,I am going to kill you. I am going to kill you.
00:02:41.035,00:02:43.329,I swear to God I'm going to kill you!
00:02:43.663,00:02:45.165,"-Eight! -No, please."
00:02:51.004,00:02:54.340,Please. Don't do this. Just let her go.
00:02:56.259,00:02:59.345,I promise you. I promise you.
00:02:59.637,00:03:01.639,I can figure out how to get whatever-- Nine.
00:03:03.433,00:03:05.018,Listen to me. Listen to me.
00:03:07.228,00:03:08.313,I want to help you.
00:03:09.314,00:03:10.940,I want to help you get whatever you want.
00:03:12.108,00:03:13.318,But you got to do what's right.
00:03:14.652,00:03:15.695,What you know is right.
00:03:28.291,00:03:29.208,No.
00:03:29.542,00:03:30.543,-Ten. -Don't!
00:04:09.540,00:04:11.292,-What are you doing? -Your brother wants another one.
00:04:11.376,00:04:12.752,"Oh, God, no. Ethan, that's what we talked about..."
00:04:12.835,00:04:15.004,-I'm watching him. He's fine. -That's how it is with Rick.
00:04:15.088,00:04:17.674,He's fine and fine and then suddenly he's naked and he's hugging everybody.
00:04:17.757,00:04:19.425,I'll take full responsibility for Rick.
00:04:19.509,00:04:20.635,You will? Full?
00:04:20.718,00:04:22.470,"-Well, mostly full. -It's a huge responsibility."
00:04:23.263,00:04:24.430,"It's going well, right?"
00:04:24.889,00:04:26.849,-It's going really well. -Yeah.
00:04:28.810,00:04:29.811,"Julia, your sister's here."
00:04:30.561,00:04:33.231,-Give me a hug. -You look so beautiful.
00:04:33.314,00:04:35.191,"I don't know about that. So, is this him?"
00:04:35.275,00:04:37.819,"-I hope so. -Oh, come here. Oh, gosh."
00:04:38.861,00:04:40.238,All right. Mom's dying to see you.
00:04:44.242,00:04:54.335,"When Julia called and told me that she was getting married, I had one thought, that it was just too bad that Daddy wasn't here to walk her down the aisle."
00:04:56.170,00:04:58.131,"And then when Julia told me... Thanks, Mom."
00:04:58.881,00:05:02.760,"That Ethan doesn't have his parents anymore, either, I got really sad."
00:05:03.428,00:05:09.392,But it occurred to me that this is about starting a new family and how beautiful that is.
00:05:09.809,00:05:15.398,"And I just want to say I am making Julia an aunt, so I expect the same treatment very, very soon."
00:05:15.690,00:05:16.607,Cheers!
00:05:24.282,00:05:26.284,I've been there over ten years now. Wow.
00:05:26.576,00:05:27.869,What do you do at the DOT?
00:05:28.244,00:05:29.412,I study traffic patterns.
00:05:30.079,00:05:37.295,"You hit the brakes for a second, just tap them on the freeway, you can literally track the ripple effect of that action across a 200-mile stretch of road, because traffic has a memory."
00:05:37.378,00:05:39.130,It's amazing. It's like a living organism.
00:05:39.547,00:05:41.132,"Freshen that up for you? What is it, vodka martini?"
00:05:41.215,00:05:42.175,Yeah. Thanks.
00:05:42.258,00:05:43.134,"Ladies, do you need..."
00:05:47.889,00:05:49.223,"-I'd marry him. -I would, too."
00:05:49.307,00:05:51.976,"Okay, so, a three-week heli-boarding honeymoon?"
00:05:52.226,00:05:55.188,"Okay, you actually get dropped-- From a helicopter, yeah."
00:05:57.482,00:05:59.525,-Tell her the story. -There's no story.
00:05:59.609,00:06:01.110,It is a good story. Tell the story.
00:06:01.194,00:06:04.155,"First of all, no one was ever good enough for Julia."
00:06:04.238,00:06:05.656,"Oh, here we go."
00:06:05.740,00:06:09.577,"Not spontaneous enough, adventurous enough, funny enough..."
00:06:09.660,00:06:10.870,"You know what? No, that's not true."
00:06:10.953,00:06:12.330,You make it sound like I've never dated.
00:06:12.538,00:06:13.539,No one we liked.
00:06:13.831,00:06:14.999,-That is true. -That is true.
00:06:29.639,00:06:32.934,Then she goes and gets in a chopper that takes off from this lake...
00:06:33.017,00:06:33.976,What was the name of that lake?
00:06:34.060,00:06:34.894,Lake...
00:06:36.854,00:06:39.232,Lake Wanaka. Wanaka.
00:06:40.233,00:06:41.567,Wanaka. Thank you.
00:06:43.111,00:06:44.737,-He heard that? -How did he hear that?
00:06:46.823,00:06:48.699,"Yeah, I'm not the only nurse employed there, you know."
00:07:15.852,00:07:17.687,"I'm psyched that you're going to be my brother, man."
00:07:19.063,00:07:20.690,"No, it's awesome. I think it's going to be sick."
00:07:21.065,00:07:23.109,"Me, too, man. I just got to get the phone."
00:07:23.734,00:07:25.319,-You rock hard. -Okay.
00:07:26.571,00:07:27.488,Hello?
00:07:29.031,00:07:29.866,"Yes, it is."
00:07:29.949,00:07:31.951,This is Ready-Travel Resort Services.
00:07:32.452,00:07:36.164,We'd like to offer you a chance to win an all-expense-paid trip to Mexico.
00:07:55.808,00:07:57.852,We ran out of ice. I'll be back in ten minutes.
00:07:57.935,00:07:59.395,"Oh, no. Can't somebody else go?"
00:07:59.479,00:08:01.105,"No, I got it. I'll be right back."
00:08:01.647,00:08:02.815,"-Hi, Betsy. -Thank you."
00:08:33.721,00:08:35.348,Can't decide what size Slurpee to get.
00:08:36.849,00:08:38.518,I usually go for the 900-ouncer.
00:08:40.978,00:08:43.481,How's that party? Sorry I had to call you.
00:08:43.814,00:08:45.608,"-Yeah, you should have come. -You should have invited me."
00:08:45.816,00:08:46.943,You know I would have.
00:08:47.193,00:08:48.110,Thanks.
00:08:50.780,00:08:56.369,"I know we joke about it, but I am always this close to begging you to stop training our people and get your ass back in the field."
00:08:56.786,00:08:59.288,"But that's not what you do any more, and so I respect that choice."
00:08:59.372,00:09:03.417,You know I do. Family's everything.
00:09:05.711,00:09:07.088,"Come on, John. What's going on, huh?"
00:09:11.884,00:09:13.094,It's Agent Farris.
00:09:14.220,00:09:15.805,She was on an operation.
00:09:16.973,00:09:18.140,She's disappeared.
00:09:19.058,00:09:20.351,Been off-grid 11 hours.
00:09:22.270,00:09:23.854,I'm sending in Search and Rescue.
00:09:24.480,00:09:25.815,I was hoping you'd want in.
00:09:30.987,00:09:32.280,You've got good people for that.
00:09:36.409,00:09:38.744,"Yeah. Yep, that we do."
00:09:39.453,00:09:42.081,Wheels up at sunrise if you have a change of heart.
00:09:43.499,00:09:45.376,Take some pictures of the party for me.
00:10:07.940,00:10:11.152,Agent Lindsey Farris was captured while on a surveillance operation.
00:10:11.360,00:10:12.570,This is the man she was tracking.
00:10:12.695,00:10:13.863,His name is Owen Davian.
00:10:14.405,00:10:18.117,"Details are eyes-only, but I can tell you that Davian's a black-market trafficker."
00:10:18.367,00:10:20.828,Extremely dangerous and a priority for us.
00:10:21.746,00:10:29.295,"At 1400 hours today, a recon satellite ID'd a caravan of vehicles with plates matching those known to have been used by Davian's operatives."
00:10:29.754,00:10:32.006,They stopped at a derelict factory outside Berlin.
00:10:32.214,00:10:33.633,It appears they have a hostage.
00:10:33.924,00:10:35.217,We believe it's Agent Farris.
00:10:35.676,00:10:41.349,"Normally we would disavow, but Lindsey may be the key to getting us closer to Davian, and that's a risk we need to take."
00:10:41.766,00:10:46.562,"Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find Lindsey and bring her home."
00:10:48.064,00:10:49.565,I've already assembled a team.
00:10:50.358,00:10:52.568,"I have them standing by, awaiting your word."
00:10:53.277,00:10:59.825,"This message, let's call it my excellent engagement gift to you, will self-destruct in five seconds."
00:10:59.909,00:11:01.410,"Good luck, Ethan, and thanks again."
00:11:32.149,00:11:34.318,-You okay? -Yeah.
00:11:36.237,00:11:37.238,Yeah.
00:11:51.001,00:11:57.049,"You know, I'm sorry. I realized I didn't tell you that the office called during the party."
00:11:57.341,00:12:02.263,I have to go to Houston for a night. METRO's having a Public Transpo conference.
00:12:05.558,00:12:06.934,It's so last-minute.
00:12:08.144,00:12:09.061,I know.
00:12:37.590,00:12:42.386,"Now, if it isn't Mr. Those Who Can't Do, Teach back in the field."
00:12:42.887,00:12:44.680,"-What's up, baby? -Hey, man."
00:12:46.098,00:12:48.392,"Hey, Ethan, don't worry. We're going to get the girl."
00:12:50.102,00:12:53.105,Or have you been away so long you've forgotten how good we are?
00:12:55.149,00:12:56.275,"Welcome back, brother."
00:13:20.674,00:13:22.384,-Is our truck in place? -Mmm-hmm.
00:13:22.843,00:13:23.761,Weapons good to go?
00:13:23.844,00:13:25.429,-Yeah. You? -Yeah.
00:13:25.971,00:13:27.139,You know I got your six.
00:13:27.723,00:13:29.850,"Hey, man. That's your job."
00:13:54.750,00:13:57.545,"Guns three, activated. Guns four, activated."
00:13:58.671,00:13:59.630,Guns ready.
00:14:06.345,00:14:08.013,All four guns operational.
00:14:08.264,00:14:11.767,"They've got men on the second, third, fourth floors."
00:14:15.646,00:14:17.439,"Observer, I'm in approach position."
00:14:17.648,00:14:19.316,Roger that. Stand by.
00:14:26.282,00:14:28.909,The prize is on the sixth floor. Two Tangos with her.
00:14:29.201,00:14:30.119,Moving in.
00:14:47.803,00:14:51.599,"So, Raider One, at some point, we got to go over this whole getting married thing."
00:14:51.891,00:14:53.058,"Negative, Observer."
00:14:54.018,00:14:56.687,I don't respect you nearly enough to have that conversation.
00:14:58.480,00:15:00.190,you're stuck with my voice in your head.
00:15:00.399,00:15:02.860,"So, this girl, what the hell do you see in her anyway?"
00:15:03.319,00:15:04.278,"Who, Julia?"
00:15:05.571,00:15:06.447,You've never met her.
00:15:06.530,00:15:08.949,"Yeah, and the way things are, I probably never will."
00:15:09.825,00:15:12.119,"Lucky for her, right? That's what you're thinking."
00:15:14.747,00:15:17.708,"Two Tangos, second floor, northwest corridor."
00:15:17.958,00:15:19.376,"Groundhog, that's you."
00:15:19.668,00:15:22.379,You need to grab that gear on the second floor as soon as we go hot.
00:15:22.796,00:15:27.176,"Copy that. I'll need two minutes, which means you'll need me in one, right?"
00:15:27.259,00:15:28.469,"Yeah, just about."
00:15:28.928,00:15:31.055,"Raider One, make a left at the top of the stairs."
00:15:31.513,00:15:33.182,The prize should be at the end of the hall.
00:15:52.910,00:15:54.119,"Phoenix, I have eye on the prize."
00:16:01.961,00:16:03.128,Call me when she wakes.
00:16:05.631,00:16:07.132,We need touchdown in less than three. Do you copy?
00:16:08.717,00:16:10.177,"Please, when do I not copy?"
00:16:10.594,00:16:11.637,All I do is copy.
00:16:16.350,00:16:18.185,Stand by to go live. On my mark.
00:16:19.436,00:16:20.312,Three.
00:16:20.521,00:16:21.522,Two.
00:16:22.064,00:16:23.607,One. Execute.
00:16:55.389,00:16:56.515,"Raider One, you're clear. Move!"
00:17:04.106,00:17:06.900,Lindsey. Lindsey.
00:17:08.902,00:17:09.945,Ethan?
00:17:11.697,00:17:12.614,I'm going to get you home.
00:17:18.537,00:17:20.497,"Observer, I've got the prize. Evac in three."
00:17:28.255,00:17:31.383,"This is adrenaline. Lindsey, you're going to feel this."
00:17:50.819,00:17:51.945,On the move!
00:18:14.426,00:18:15.636,"Observer, we're on the move."
00:18:16.386,00:18:18.597,Wrap out. Evac in 90 seconds.
00:18:19.848,00:18:21.225,"Phoenix, get to the LZ now."
00:18:21.517,00:18:23.393,"Roger, Observer. On my way."
00:18:40.536,00:18:42.871,Ethan. I have to talk to you.
00:18:42.955,00:18:44.414,"-Come on, come on. -I have to talk to you right now!"
00:18:44.748,00:18:47.876,Just for you. Turn off your transmitter.
00:18:48.877,00:18:50.337,"Do it, Ethan!"
00:19:00.889,00:19:01.723,Ethan!
00:19:11.400,00:19:12.442,Lindsey! Moving!
00:19:25.789,00:19:26.707,Mag!
00:19:28.500,00:19:29.543,Ready to move.
00:19:54.359,00:19:55.402,We evac from here.
00:19:55.736,00:19:56.695,Get down!
00:20:03.702,00:20:05.162,I'm out. How many rounds you got?
00:20:08.498,00:20:09.333,Enough.
00:20:20.844,00:20:21.803,Now I'm out.
00:20:25.432,00:20:26.600,"T minus five, baby."
00:20:39.529,00:20:40.697,"Lindsey, hold on to me."
00:21:03.011,00:21:03.929,Luther!
00:21:04.721,00:21:05.764,Rolling!
00:21:32.457,00:21:35.627,God! My head. What is that?
00:21:35.711,00:21:36.962,-What is... -Is she okay?
00:21:37.379,00:21:39.131,Lindsey. Let's get to the chopper.
00:21:39.589,00:21:41.049,"Zhen, get rid of the truck."
00:21:41.133,00:21:41.967,Let's go!
00:21:49.224,00:21:51.601,God! What is that? You can't hear that?
00:21:56.356,00:21:57.691,-Let's go! -We loaded?
00:21:57.774,00:21:59.359,Yeah. Let's do it! Move out!
00:22:05.449,00:22:06.992,"Go, go, go, go, go!"
00:22:29.181,00:22:31.058,-Son of a bitch. -No!
00:22:32.350,00:22:33.685,I'm going to try and lose them.
00:22:37.272,00:22:39.316,Turn it off. Please.
00:22:56.333,00:22:57.751,"Please, Ethan."
00:23:08.970,00:23:10.514,"Guys, their missiles are hot!"
00:23:15.852,00:23:17.187,Incoming! Hold on.
00:23:29.282,00:23:31.243,Okay. That was lucky. We only get one of those.
00:23:41.086,00:23:42.254,Do we have a defibrillator?
00:23:47.551,00:23:48.677,Bring it on!
00:23:51.763,00:23:52.973,Ethan! What is it?
00:23:53.056,00:23:54.307,Did they put something in my head?
00:23:54.391,00:23:56.560,They injected you with a time-release charge.
00:23:56.643,00:23:57.978,-Do you remember that? -No. Time-release...
00:23:58.061,00:23:59.604,An explosive. They've activated it.
00:23:59.688,00:24:02.107,"It's gonna detonate unless we fry the charge, which is what we're gonna do."
00:24:02.190,00:24:03.650,"No, Ethan. Zap her like that, you'll stop her heart."
00:24:03.733,00:24:05.318,Then I'll zap her again and bring her back.
00:24:06.778,00:24:07.696,Do it!
00:24:19.374,00:24:21.585,"Zhen, hold on. Hold on, hold on!"
00:24:44.941,00:24:46.151,I want you to set it for 150.
00:24:46.234,00:24:47.152,One hundred and fifty.
00:24:47.235,00:24:49.279,"Lindsey, I'm gonna short out the explosive in your head. You're gonna be okay."
00:24:51.531,00:24:52.407,Damn it.
00:25:00.790,00:25:02.918,-They have us locked. -Twenty seconds.
00:25:04.461,00:25:05.503,Hold on.
00:25:24.272,00:25:25.774,-Ten seconds. -Almost there. Almost there.
00:25:28.526,00:25:30.779,Ethan. Thank you.
00:26:06.022,00:26:07.065,Shit.
00:26:44.394,00:26:45.395,Hey.
00:26:47.147,00:26:48.148,Hey.
00:26:56.072,00:26:57.115,How did it go?
00:27:00.577,00:27:03.580,I'm sorry. Fine. I'm sorry.
00:27:04.748,00:27:05.790,I'm just tired.
00:27:38.031,00:27:40.533,The words you used were beyond capable.
00:27:40.617,00:27:41.785,"That still stand, Mr. Hunt?"
00:27:41.993,00:27:43.453,-Mr. Brassel... -Does it stand?
00:27:45.163,00:27:46.206,"Yes, sir, it does."
00:27:49.709,00:27:54.172,Killed by a detonator implanted in her skull through the nasal cavity.
00:27:55.882,00:27:59.177,"Mr. Brassel, it's unacceptable to judge Agent Farris' competence based..."
00:27:59.260,00:28:03.014,"It's unacceptable that chocolate makes you fat, but I've eaten my share. And guess what?"
00:28:03.473,00:28:10.397,"Now, I approved Agent Farris' surveillance op based on your evaluations, Mr. Hunt, of a woman who allowed herself to be captured."
00:28:10.730,00:28:12.190,So you go to recover her.
00:28:12.273,00:28:13.691,You encounter a dozen men.
00:28:13.817,00:28:15.443,You don't grab any of them?
00:28:15.568,00:28:18.947,"Our objective, Mr. Brassel, was to recover Agent Farris."
00:28:20.156,00:28:22.367,Davian employs a cellular structure at his organization.
00:28:22.450,00:28:24.536,The men there more than likely had no information...
00:28:24.619,00:28:25.745,Who's drawing these conclusions?
00:28:25.954,00:28:26.830,Is it you?
00:28:27.747,00:28:29.332,"I am, sir. Based upon..."
00:28:29.457,00:28:30.667,I'm not on you yet.
00:28:31.543,00:28:34.045,You allowed Farris to board your chopper without a scan.
00:28:34.129,00:28:36.339,That explosive device could have taken you all out.
00:28:36.423,00:28:40.885,"There is one reason that you are sitting here before me today, and that is luck."
00:28:40.969,00:28:45.348,Because your operation was poorly conceived and executed worse.
00:28:45.432,00:28:46.641,Two laptops were recovered...
00:28:46.725,00:28:47.684,I'm aware of that.
00:28:47.767,00:28:49.269,We've talked to Tech Services.
00:28:49.352,00:28:51.604,They doubt if they can reconstitute the drives.
00:28:51.688,00:28:54.190,"Crispy, I believe, is what they called them."
00:28:54.274,00:28:55.275,Worthless.
00:28:55.358,00:28:58.945,"Mr. Brassel, as Operation Manager of this office, -I have the authority-- -Excuse me."
00:28:59.028,00:29:01.114,"Did you just throw a title at me, Mr. Musgrave?"
00:29:02.073,00:29:04.284,I don't care if your daddy plays golf with the President.
00:29:05.577,00:29:08.455,This is Intelligence. So far I haven't seen any.
00:29:08.705,00:29:11.082,"You think this op was worth the risk, Mr. Hunt."
00:29:12.876,00:29:15.295,What do you know about Owen Davian?
00:29:16.838,00:29:21.176,He was the one who brought gas centrifuge technology to Korea from Pakistan.
00:29:21.259,00:29:25.472,He was also the man who sold Toxin Five to the Armahad Republic Jihad.
00:29:26.014,00:29:30.143,"He is a man who provides, provides, provides."
00:29:31.436,00:29:32.896,And he remains invisible.
00:29:32.979,00:29:34.731,He's a goddamn invisible man.
00:29:35.315,00:29:37.484,"Wells, not Ellison, in case you want to be cute again."
00:29:38.318,00:29:39.819,We can't find him.
00:29:41.404,00:29:44.574,He knows it. It's emboldened him.
00:29:46.242,00:29:48.620,I've been trying to bring Davian down since the day that I got here.
00:29:48.703,00:29:49.871,Do you know what I've got for it?
00:29:49.954,00:29:52.081,It's never been confirmed the Toxin Five theft was Davian.
00:29:52.165,00:29:55.627,"Mr. Musgrave, please don't interrupt me when I'm asking rhetorical questions."
00:29:56.461,00:29:58.254,Your operation has achieved one thing.
00:29:58.630,00:30:01.841,You have reminded Davian that he is winning.
00:30:03.510,00:30:10.183,"And now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go inform Mr. and Mrs. Farris that their baby girl was killed in a head-on collision on I-95."
00:30:15.230,00:30:20.819,"by the death of one of God's children, Lindsey Elizabeth Farris."
00:30:21.736,00:30:25.865,It is always startling when the Lord takes one of our young so unexpectedly.
00:30:30.203,00:30:32.622,Keep your knees bent. Good. Good.
00:30:32.705,00:30:34.707,"Now, to fire the lock, the extractor has to be..."
00:30:34.791,00:30:37.961,That bag's not going to hit you back. Hit harder. Don't rely on your sights.
00:30:38.044,00:30:39.504,Keep your eyes dead on the target...
00:30:39.587,00:30:41.214,Attack me. Come on.
00:30:41.339,00:30:44.175,Don't ever release the firing pin unless the extractor's...
00:30:44.259,00:30:45.844,Good. There you go. Good.
00:30:46.970,00:30:49.430,Identify the target. Point and shoot.
00:30:49.514,00:30:52.100,It's very simple. You point and shoot. Stay focused.
00:30:52.308,00:30:54.686,"Miss Farris, you know how many recruits I've trained."
00:30:55.353,00:30:59.524,I'm proud to say that you are the first that I've recommended for active field duty.
00:31:00.191,00:31:01.276,Congratulations.
00:31:09.158,00:31:10.076,Yes?
00:31:15.039,00:31:16.666,Yes. Who is this?
00:31:17.500,00:31:19.168,I'm calling from Norfolk Mail Service.
00:31:19.544,00:31:21.713,Lindsey Farris rents a post office box here.
00:31:22.005,00:31:25.258,She sent you a piece of mail from Berlin and asked us to call you when it arrived.
00:31:25.592,00:31:26.718,It came this morning.
00:31:31.973,00:31:32.849,Thank you.
00:31:57.999,00:32:00.293,A microdot with nothing on it. This is unusual.
00:32:00.585,00:32:02.545,Lindsey wouldn't send me a blank microdot.
00:32:02.629,00:32:04.255,"I'm telling you, man, there's no image."
00:32:04.339,00:32:05.590,Then you're not looking in the right place.
00:32:05.673,00:32:07.133,Where the hell am I supposed to look?
00:32:07.216,00:32:08.718,There's not much square footage to this thing.
00:32:08.801,00:32:10.261,Why would Lindsey send me a blank microdot?
00:32:10.345,00:32:12.055,I don't know. Why would Lindsey send you anything?
00:32:12.138,00:32:13.848,"You were her instructor, not her handler."
00:32:15.683,00:32:21.189,"Listen, man. I don't mean to cross the line, but, was there something going on between you two?"
00:32:22.649,00:32:23.650,You and Lindsey.
00:32:24.901,00:32:26.903,Lindsey was like my little sister.
00:32:27.987,00:32:32.408,"And you never slept with your little sister, right?"
00:32:36.245,00:32:38.247,"Hey, brother, if I don't ask you, who will?"
00:32:39.207,00:32:41.376,Maybe it's magnetic. The microdot.
00:32:42.669,00:32:43.795,"Well, that's old school."
00:32:44.420,00:32:47.548,"If she was in a hurry and only had access to black-market gear, maybe."
00:32:49.092,00:32:50.051,I might know a guy.
00:32:50.134,00:32:52.428,"-Magnetic means encrypted. -Yeah, I know that."
00:32:52.679,00:32:55.473,Yeah. Be right there.
00:32:55.556,00:32:57.684,The thing about Lindsey is she was brand-new.
00:32:58.726,00:32:59.978,She was sweet.
00:33:00.728,00:33:02.105,Remember when you were sweet?
00:33:02.188,00:33:03.523,Can you remember that far back?
00:33:03.606,00:33:05.024,"Yeah, well, barely."
00:33:06.067,00:33:08.528,"In Germany, you asked me what it is I see in Julia."
00:33:09.946,00:33:12.156,What I see in Julia is life before all this.
00:33:13.783,00:33:14.784,And it's good.
00:33:17.787,00:33:18.913,"Benji, what have you got?"
00:33:18.997,00:33:21.708,"Uh, well, these hard drive platters are just fried."
00:33:21.791,00:33:22.625,Yeah.
00:33:22.709,00:33:23.835,"You know, they made, made a mess of them."
00:33:23.918,00:33:25.086,It's just like... There's holes in them and stuff.
00:33:25.169,00:33:27.005,"And it's got scorched all the way through. And then, there, uh..."
00:33:27.088,00:33:28.589,"Look, this one's got a hole in it and stuff."
00:33:28.756,00:33:29.882,I can't believe. I can't even look at it.
00:33:29.966,00:33:32.301,-Benji. Did you recover anything? -Yes. Yes.
00:33:32.385,00:33:39.892,"Despite the aforementioned conditions of the hard drive you brought back, I managed to recover portions of, uh, two dozen e-mail files."
00:33:40.059,00:33:43.312,Also made what I believe to be a thoroughly promotion-worthy breakthrough.
00:33:45.690,00:33:51.612,Your Mr. Davian is going to arrive in Rome the day after tomorrow and attend a function at one Vatican City.
00:33:51.863,00:33:53.865,What the hell is Davian doing at the Vatican?
00:33:54.073,00:33:56.159,It's all got to do with the Rabbit's Foot.
00:33:56.242,00:33:57.243,Rabbit's Foot?
00:33:57.326,00:34:03.624,"Yeah, well, I'm assuming it's like a code word for something he's about to sell to an unspecified buyer, for $850 million, by the way."
00:34:03.750,00:34:07.545,"Or maybe it's not a code word. Maybe it's just a really, really expensive bunny appendage."
00:34:07.879,00:34:09.130,You have no idea what it is?
00:34:09.589,00:34:12.258,"It's interesting. I used to have this professor at Oxford, okay?"
00:34:12.341,00:34:15.595,"Dr. Wickham, his name was, and he was like this massive, fat guy."
00:34:15.762,00:34:18.222,"You know, huge, big guy. We used to call him..."
00:34:18.306,00:34:29.192,"You know. Well, I won't tell you what we used to call him. He taught bimolecular kinetics and cellular dynamics, and he used to sort of scare the underclassmen with this story about how the world would eventually be eviscerated by technology."
00:34:29.567,00:34:35.698,"You see, it was inevitable that a compound would be created, which he referred to as the Anti-God."
00:34:35.782,00:34:42.955,"It was like an accelerated mutator, a sort of, you know, like an unstoppable force of destructive power that would just lay waste to everything."
00:34:43.039,00:34:47.168,"To buildings and parks and streets and children and ice cream parlors, you know?"
00:34:48.336,00:34:58.221,"So whenever I see, like, a rogue organization, willing to spend this amount of money on a mystery tech, I always assume it's the Anti-God."
00:35:00.098,00:35:01.891,"End-of-the-world kind of stuff, you know?"
00:35:04.310,00:35:06.854,"But, no, I don't have any idea what it is. I was just speculating."
00:35:07.396,00:35:09.941,"-Did you brief Musgrave on this? -Who, me? No, not yet."
00:35:12.235,00:35:13.653,-Don't tell anyone about this. -This took me ages.
00:35:13.778,00:35:17.156,"If something goes wrong with the operation, I want Musgrave to have deniability."
00:35:17.824,00:35:18.950,"That's great work, Benji."
00:35:19.158,00:35:20.243,What operation?
00:35:21.786,00:35:24.622,"That look in your eye is a pain in my ass. You know that, right?"
00:35:30.253,00:35:32.380,Any available resident to Pediatrics.
00:35:34.924,00:35:37.135,"Rehabilitative Care, call the pharmacy."
00:35:39.637,00:35:40.972,"Rehabilitative Care, call the..."
00:35:42.431,00:35:43.599,I have to go away again.
00:35:45.184,00:35:48.646,On business. Two days.
00:35:50.273,00:35:51.232,Two days?
00:35:52.692,00:35:53.609,Yeah.
00:36:00.491,00:36:01.868,"Ethan, what's going on?"
00:36:04.203,00:36:11.210,I keep thinking you just need time to tell me whatever it is that it's...
00:36:16.048,00:36:17.884,But nothing in my mind makes sense.
00:36:21.179,00:36:22.054,Yeah.
00:36:26.517,00:36:27.602,What's wrong?
00:36:36.068,00:36:37.570,What are you not telling me?
00:37:05.014,00:37:06.974,"I need, I need to ask you for something."
00:37:07.516,00:37:09.644,And it's the most...
00:37:19.445,00:37:20.696,I need you to trust me.
00:37:23.699,00:37:25.201,Of course I trust you.
00:37:30.039,00:37:32.708,Am I ever going to be able to understand what this is?
00:37:37.046,00:37:38.673,I need you to trust me.
00:37:45.263,00:37:46.305,Yes.
00:37:47.723,00:37:49.016,I trust you.
00:37:52.478,00:37:53.521,Is it...
00:37:54.772,00:37:56.065,Tell me it's real.
00:38:01.779,00:38:02.989,I mean us.
00:38:04.824,00:38:06.284,Tell me it's real.
00:38:09.370,00:38:10.329,Follow me.
00:38:13.624,00:38:16.794,are not to be taken without careful thought and prayer.
00:38:18.504,00:38:25.511,This love is not to be diminished by difficult circumstances and it is only to be dissolved by death.
00:38:27.555,00:38:28.597,Do you have the rings?
00:38:29.724,00:38:30.641,Yeah.
00:38:45.364,00:38:46.615,Repeat after me.
00:38:53.789,00:38:55.791,"I, Julia Anne Meade..."
00:38:57.293,00:39:00.379,"I, Julia Anne Meade..."
00:39:00.838,00:39:03.758,...hereby take Ethan Matthew Hunt...
00:39:04.967,00:39:07.345,...hereby take Ethan Matthew Hunt...
00:39:07.803,00:39:10.306,...to be my lawfully wedded husband.
00:39:10.765,00:39:12.808,...to be my lawfully wedded husband.
00:39:31.035,00:39:34.205,Tomorrow maybe the only time we can predict where Owen Davian is going to be.
00:39:34.622,00:39:36.040,Charity event. Vatican City.
00:39:36.207,00:39:38.793,Our mission is to get in and kidnap Davian.
00:39:39.418,00:39:40.795,I don't know why he's so happy.
00:39:42.046,00:39:45.216,I did remind him that the Vatican is the Vatican.
00:39:45.591,00:39:55.643,"A 109-acre sovereign state in the middle of Rome, surrounded by a 60-foot wall, which is monitored 24-7, with over 200 CCTV cameras."
00:39:56.977,00:39:58.562,That's not even what makes it a challenge.
00:39:59.480,00:40:00.689,Getting Davian is good.
00:40:01.399,00:40:03.651,But getting his buyers is even better.
00:40:04.360,00:40:07.029,"If they realize he's been grabbed, they'll disappear."
00:40:08.030,00:40:09.281,"I'm sorry, what are you saying?"
00:40:10.199,00:40:13.244,"No matter how we grab Davian, his clients are gonna know he's been taken."
00:40:13.536,00:40:16.163,"No, they won't. Access point is here."
00:40:16.789,00:40:19.708,It's a one-way street adjacent to the Vatican wall.
00:40:19.834,00:40:23.003,I'll need 30 seconds. And we'll need a truck.
00:40:27.758,00:40:28.843,Wait a minute!
00:40:34.557,00:40:36.308,Why are you acting like this?
00:40:36.392,00:40:37.935,It is a brand new van!
00:41:00.249,00:41:02.918,"Now we've pissed off every Italian in Rome, go do what you got to do."
00:41:03.002,00:41:04.378,-Don't forget the smoke. -Yeah.
00:41:47.421,00:41:48.672,Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.
00:43:04.665,00:43:05.666,Right on schedule.
00:43:06.625,00:43:08.168,We should have breach in 60.
00:43:08.627,00:43:11.338,"Roger that. Charlie team, report."
00:43:17.261,00:43:19.054,Except I think I should be right on time.
00:43:19.430,00:43:20.431,We'll be waiting for you.
00:43:20.514,00:43:21.557,ETA two minutes.
00:43:54.840,00:43:56.467,"Charlie team, did you fire the tracer yet?"
00:43:57.801,00:43:58.969,Stand by.
00:44:13.609,00:44:15.861,Firing the tracer. Now.
00:44:25.204,00:44:26.163,Roger that.
00:44:29.625,00:44:30.834,"Charlie team, I see you."
00:44:31.210,00:44:33.295,I'm looping the security feed. Stand by to move.
00:44:33.504,00:44:34.380,Roger that.
00:44:36.674,00:44:38.175,Video is looped. Go.
00:44:52.189,00:44:54.525,"Alpha team, catacomb video taken care of?"
00:44:54.608,00:44:56.360,Taken care of. We're good to go.
00:45:05.119,00:45:06.412,"Delta team, do you copy?"
00:45:08.956,00:45:09.998,That's funny.
00:45:10.457,00:45:11.834,Get ready to move into position.
00:45:12.209,00:45:13.168,I'm already there.
00:45:13.419,00:45:14.378,Really?
00:45:19.007,00:45:20.092,See you in 30.
00:45:30.185,00:45:31.562,Alpha team moving into position.
00:45:31.937,00:45:33.522,Bravo standing by for transmission.
00:45:35.566,00:45:36.483,Transmitting.
00:45:40.112,00:45:41.071,Got you.
00:45:57.713,00:45:59.882,I should be on the list. Thank you.
00:46:02.926,00:46:04.678,There must be a mistake.
00:46:04.970,00:46:06.054,Excuse me!
00:46:13.562,00:46:14.646,Miss Demea?
00:46:15.856,00:46:16.857,Just a minute.
00:47:16.416,00:47:17.751,We have a photo opportunity.
00:47:20.921,00:47:22.214,"Delta, ready for upload."
00:47:52.995,00:47:56.832,"Listen, man, I didn't mean to be so cavalier the other day about you getting engaged."
00:47:57.332,00:47:59.710,I know that. Thanks.
00:48:02.963,00:48:05.924,But a normal relationship isn't viable for people like us.
00:48:06.091,00:48:07.175,I don't agree with that.
00:48:07.259,00:48:08.719,Then I'm smarter than you.
00:48:08.969,00:48:11.388,I'm going up. I agree with Luther.
00:48:11.763,00:48:13.432,We can't have real relationships.
00:48:13.515,00:48:15.392,"But you see, I love that."
00:48:40.751,00:48:45.422,Twenty-three months. That's as long as it'll last when you got the baggage we do and the lifestyle we got.
00:48:45.922,00:48:47.591,"-Really? -Yeah, really."
00:48:48.884,00:48:51.386,Look at me. I know what I'm talking about.
00:48:51.762,00:48:53.847,And you know I know what I'm talking about.
00:49:06.860,00:49:07.819,Wait here.
00:49:32.135,00:49:33.637,We're going to have to move sooner than we thought.
00:49:33.720,00:49:35.097,Can you identify who made the drop?
00:49:35.305,00:49:37.224,Negative. How close are you guys?
00:49:37.724,00:49:38.975,We're just printing now.
00:49:58.870,00:50:05.335,"I'm not proud of it. I'm not happy about it, but I've lived with women a few times, and it doesn't ever make it to two years."
00:50:05.419,00:50:06.461,You can't.
00:50:06.545,00:50:09.589,"Thanks for the advice, but it's different for me than it is for you, you know?"
00:50:10.006,00:50:11.174,I'm not in the field any more.
00:50:11.258,00:50:12.092,"Oh, okay."
00:50:12.175,00:50:13.510,Here's a retirement present.
00:50:17.347,00:50:20.809,"In our job, there's always going to be something between you and a woman."
00:50:21.017,00:50:21.893,Always.
00:50:22.185,00:50:23.937,"-Luther, listen. -Dishonesty."
00:50:24.646,00:50:27.274,A dishonesty that poisons everything.
00:50:27.733,00:50:29.151,I think I need to tell you something...
00:50:29.234,00:50:30.235,Stop talking.
00:50:30.569,00:50:32.237,"This isn't about you, Ethan."
00:50:32.821,00:50:36.283,"And whoever this girl is, you're going to end up messing up her life, too."
00:50:36.825,00:50:38.034,Don't do it.
00:50:39.745,00:50:41.288,Jules and I got married two days ago.
00:50:44.541,00:50:45.584,Congratulations.
00:50:47.127,00:50:49.421,Thanks. Thanks.
00:50:54.468,00:50:55.761,He's walking. I'm going in.
00:50:58.346,00:50:59.473,I'm on my way.
00:51:04.728,00:51:06.229,Ma'am. I need you to step back.
00:51:06.855,00:51:08.774,No. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.
00:51:08.857,00:51:11.067,I always spill red wine on my white custom-made shirt.
00:51:11.234,00:51:13.361,-Okay. Step back. -It's fine. It's fine.
00:51:13.695,00:51:14.529,Bathroom.
00:51:17.365,00:51:18.366,Tell me you're on your way.
00:51:18.742,00:51:19.868,I'm on the move.
00:51:29.628,00:51:30.504,Move it. Come on.
00:51:34.466,00:51:36.301,His bodyguards are checking out the bathroom.
00:51:36.843,00:51:37.969,I'm almost there.
00:52:19.511,00:52:20.470,He's going in.
00:52:47.914,00:52:50.041,Quiet. Read this.
00:52:50.625,00:52:51.626,Slowly.
00:52:53.795,00:52:54.921,Read it.
00:52:56.965,00:53:02.470,The pleasure of Buzby's company is what I most enjoy.
00:53:03.847,00:53:09.644,He put a tack on Miss Yancy's chair when she called him a horrible boy.
00:53:11.855,00:53:14.816,he was flinging two kittens across the width of the room.
00:53:15.400,00:53:18.153,I count on his schemes to reveal the...
00:53:18.486,00:53:20.655,-What the hell is this? -Finish.
00:53:23.116,00:53:24.784,"Alpha, you're about to have a visitor."
00:53:24.993,00:53:25.827,Finish.
00:53:26.202,00:53:27.537,...a way to escape my gloom.
00:53:37.422,00:53:38.882,"Delta, stall him. I need more time."
00:53:50.852,00:53:51.895,"Sir, is everything all right?"
00:53:51.978,00:53:53.063,Everything is not all right.
00:53:53.146,00:53:54.522,Voice mask is still compiling.
00:54:00.153,00:54:01.154,Sir?
00:54:08.995,00:54:10.038,Sir?
00:54:17.921,00:54:19.089,"Six seconds, I'm uploading."
00:54:25.178,00:54:26.680,I'm fine. Wait outside.
00:54:41.820,00:54:42.988,See you in the sewer.
00:54:51.246,00:54:52.497,She's sorry about your shirt.
00:54:52.580,00:54:53.748,That's no problem.
00:54:58.003,00:55:01.131,"Her hotel has laundry service, and she'll happily take care of it."
00:55:01.339,00:55:02.590,You want to wash my shirt?
00:55:02.882,00:55:06.177,"What are we going to do while we're waiting in your hotel room, and I'm not wearing my shirt?"
00:55:10.849,00:55:12.183,She'll think of something.
00:55:13.852,00:55:15.061,She would like to drive.
00:55:15.311,00:55:16.479,Follow me to the hotel.
00:55:17.313,00:55:18.857,"Sir, would you like us to watch the case?"
00:55:18.940,00:55:19.941,No.
00:55:21.276,00:55:22.694,-Nice job. -Thank you.
00:56:01.566,00:56:02.942,-What's up? -Nothing.
00:56:03.026,00:56:05.070,-What's up with you? -Nothing.
00:56:23.671,00:56:24.839,Blow the car.
00:56:26.800,00:56:28.927,Oh. It's such a nice car.
00:56:29.427,00:56:31.429,"And yet, do it."
00:56:55.787,00:57:00.583,I direct your attention to the third satellite image in the series forwarded to us by our friends...
00:57:02.418,00:57:03.419,Send him in.
00:57:06.005,00:57:09.551,Ethan Hunt and his team just grabbed Owen Davian in Rome.
00:57:09.801,00:57:10.927,They're headed back now.
00:57:11.511,00:57:12.637,I thought you should know.
00:57:13.972,00:57:15.849,You were aware of this operation?
00:57:18.226,00:57:19.352,"Yes, I was."
00:57:20.645,00:57:21.771,Then good work.
00:57:25.859,00:57:27.026,Thank you.
00:58:01.561,00:58:03.354,"You're dead, Mr. Davian."
00:58:08.318,00:58:09.611,There were witnesses.
00:58:13.531,00:58:15.074,That was you in the bathroom.
00:58:15.867,00:58:17.410,"Now, you're going to tell us everything."
00:58:17.911,00:58:20.330,Every buyer you've worked with. Every organization.
00:58:20.413,00:58:21.623,What the hell is your name?
00:58:21.706,00:58:23.833,"Names, contacts, inventory lists."
00:58:23.917,00:58:26.794,"You have a wife, girlfriend?"
00:58:29.297,00:58:30.590,It's up to you how this goes.
00:58:31.049,00:58:32.717,Because you know what I'm going to do next?
00:58:34.177,00:58:38.473,"I'm going to find her, whoever she is, I'm going to find her, and I'm going to hurt her."
00:58:43.728,00:58:48.816,You were apprehended carrying details of the location of something code named the Rabbit's Foot.
00:58:48.900,00:58:51.819,"I'm going to make her bleed, and cry, and call out your name."
00:58:52.695,00:58:55.406,And you're not going to be able to do shit. You know why?
00:58:58.076,00:58:59.118,What is the Rabbit's Foot?
00:58:59.202,00:59:00.828,Because you're going to be this close to dead.
00:59:01.496,00:59:02.539,And who is the buyer?
00:59:02.622,00:59:05.500,And then I'm going to kill you right in front of her.
00:59:07.669,00:59:09.546,-I'm going to ask you one more time. -What's your name?
00:59:09.629,00:59:10.922,-What is the Rabbit's Foot? -Who are you?
00:59:11.005,00:59:11.923,And who is the buyer?
00:59:12.006,00:59:13.800,"You don't have any idea what the hell is going on, do you?"
00:59:14.842,00:59:17.845,"I mean, you saw what I did to your little blonde friend at the factory, right?"
00:59:22.475,00:59:28.022,"Well, that was nothing. That was, uh, fun."
00:59:32.360,00:59:33.194,That was fun.
01:00:04.809,01:00:06.144,What is the Rabbit's Foot?
01:00:13.610,01:00:15.278,-Ethan! -What is the Rabbit's Foot?
01:00:18.364,01:00:19.324,What is it?
01:00:23.202,01:00:24.829,-Ethan! -What is the Rabbit's Foot?
01:00:27.749,01:00:28.750,You tell me!
01:00:28.833,01:00:30.501,"Ethan, stop! Don't do it."
01:00:30.627,01:00:32.629,"This isn't you, man! This isn't you!"
01:00:33.087,01:00:35.840,"We can use him, Ethan! You know that!"
01:00:42.180,01:00:43.973,"No, Ethan! Don't do it!"
01:00:45.892,01:00:47.101,"Please, stop!"
01:01:18.466,01:01:32.188,"What I'm selling, and who I'm selling to, is the last thing you should be concerned about, Ethan."
01:02:34.625,01:02:35.793,It's a video file.
01:02:40.882,01:02:43.468,"Ethan, I don't know what they've told you. I don't know what you think."
01:02:43.760,01:02:44.761,Just listen to me.
01:02:45.386,01:02:49.807,"Brassel sent me to Germany to surveil an exchange, to ID a man named Owen Davian."
01:02:50.224,01:02:52.727,"I tagged his phone, and I intercepted a transmission."
01:02:53.019,01:02:56.397,"I traced the call through the IMF network, and this is what came up."
01:02:56.898,01:02:59.817,The call to Davian came from Brassel's office.
01:03:00.443,01:03:01.569,It's Brassel.
01:03:01.986,01:03:03.362,I think he's working with Davian.
01:03:04.071,01:03:05.114,I think I'm being set up...
01:04:05.842,01:04:07.593,Does anyone have a cell phone?
01:04:41.669,01:04:43.045,"Everybody, get down!"
01:04:43.963,01:04:47.216,"Get down! Get down, get down! Everybody, get down!"
01:05:03.649,01:05:05.276,-There's a woman down. -I see her.
01:05:23.252,01:05:25.588,Get down! Get down! Stay down!
01:05:27.173,01:05:29.717,"Everybody, get down! Get down! Stay down!"
01:05:29.800,01:05:31.010,Get down! Get down!
01:05:34.847,01:05:35.723,Open up!
01:05:36.098,01:05:37.808,Open up! I need the prisoner!
01:05:56.577,01:05:58.704,"It's really bleeding. Don't leave me, okay?"
01:05:58.788,01:05:59.956,Don't worry. I'm right here.
01:06:01.123,01:06:03.417,"Ethan, there's a G36 in the truck!"
01:06:03.501,01:06:04.585,I know! I know!
01:06:45.835,01:06:47.294,Ethan! Get out of the truck!
01:06:55.302,01:06:56.470,"Ethan, move!"
01:09:07.268,01:09:08.102,Hello?
01:09:08.227,01:09:09.728,"Rick, this is Ethan. Is Julia home?"
01:09:09.812,01:09:14.692,"Hey, man. Hey, look, I hope you're not mad I'm here. It's just-- Rick, I'm not mad. Is Julia home?"
01:09:14.775,01:09:16.485,"I tried her cell phone, and there was no answer."
01:09:16.861,01:09:18.279,"Uh, no. Sorry."
01:09:18.612,01:09:20.489,"Hey, did your, uh, did your friend find you?"
01:09:22.324,01:09:23.242,Which friend?
01:09:28.789,01:09:29.999,"Rick, what did you tell him?"
01:09:30.249,01:09:35.254,"Look, it's all good, man. I told him I didn't know where you were, and Julia might, and he should just try her at the hospital."
01:09:38.716,01:09:39.550,Hello?
01:09:45.764,01:09:46.849,"All right, see you tomorrow, Sally."
01:09:46.932,01:09:48.058,"All right. Good night, honey."
01:10:07.578,01:10:09.496,the Chesapeake Bay Bridge is closed in both directions.
01:10:09.788,01:10:10.623,Sixth floor.
01:10:10.706,01:10:12.708,"Sally, this is Ethan. I need to talk to Julia."
01:10:13.834,01:10:15.461,She just went downstairs. I'll transfer you.
01:10:36.649,01:10:37.650,Damn it!
01:10:38.692,01:10:39.652,Excuse me.
01:10:39.860,01:10:41.946,I was wondering if you knew where I might find this patient.
01:10:42.112,01:10:44.740,Probably not. But I'll know who can.
01:10:50.329,01:10:51.455,What's that?
01:11:09.807,01:11:11.308,-Where's Julia? -I think she left.
01:11:11.976,01:11:13.435,Have you tried the east building?
01:11:20.943,01:11:22.361,-Has Julia left yet? -I haven't seen her.
01:11:22.569,01:11:24.989,"-Mike, Mike, Mike. Have you seen Julia? -Hey, you okay?"
01:11:25.072,01:11:26.031,Have you seen Julia?
01:11:26.115,01:11:26.949,No.
01:11:43.507,01:11:44.466,Jules?
01:11:46.719,01:11:50.931,You can always tell someone's character by the way they treat those they don't need to treat well.
01:11:51.015,01:11:52.099,"If you hurt her, I swear..."
01:11:55.144,01:12:00.816,"The briefcase I picked up in Rome, the one you took from me, contains the location of the Rabbit's Foot."
01:12:01.150,01:12:02.693,You're going to get it and bring it to me.
01:12:03.068,01:12:04.194,The Rabbit's Foot.
01:12:04.820,01:12:07.197,"Ethan, you had a watch last time I saw you."
01:12:07.614,01:12:10.034,"You have 48 hours, starting on my mark."
01:12:10.409,01:12:11.327,"Wait, wait, wait."
01:12:11.410,01:12:13.579,"Now, call me at this number when you have it."
01:12:13.662,01:12:14.705,"Just, just wait."
01:12:16.290,01:12:18.334,"You have 48 hours, or she dies."
01:12:18.417,01:12:19.877,Wait! Wait. Wait.
01:12:27.426,01:12:28.761,We need you to come with us.
01:12:29.470,01:12:31.722,"Just... Pete, what the hell is this?"
01:12:31.930,01:12:34.058,"Sorry about that, Mr. Hunt. We were told to bring you in."
01:12:36.769,01:12:38.896,Whoa. Just... Hey. Just not right now.
01:12:40.689,01:12:44.276,"We don't want to use force here, and you know we will. Ethan, get in."
01:12:47.029,01:12:48.238,"...and that I left already, okay?"
01:12:54.119,01:12:55.204,Freeze!
01:13:42.418,01:13:45.003,I reviewed the transcript of your Berlin operation.
01:13:45.504,01:13:46.672,It's very interesting.
01:13:47.506,01:13:52.928,It seems that Agent Farris had some information she wished to share with you but not with this agency.
01:13:53.011,01:13:54.596,Something you failed to report.
01:13:54.930,01:13:58.058,You ordered the Vatican operation without proper approvals.
01:13:58.142,01:14:00.644,That mission resulted in a catastrophic attack.
01:14:00.727,01:14:01.979,And then you fled the scene.
01:14:02.646,01:14:05.858,"Now, I am not a stranger to disrespect."
01:14:06.650,01:14:09.361,You don't get to where I am without developing a thick skin.
01:14:09.528,01:14:19.371,"But what I won't stand for, what I will lose sleep over, and I love my sleep, is the idea of an irresponsible rogue agent working in my office."
01:14:19.455,01:14:23.375,So I'm going to slow things way down here.
01:14:27.129,01:14:37.222,"You can look at me with those judgmental, incriminating eyes all you want, but I bullshit you not. I will bleed on the flag to make sure the stripes stay red."
01:14:56.700,01:14:58.076,I don't know what to say to you.
01:15:00.162,01:15:02.789,Brassel's right. You're out of control.
01:15:04.041,01:15:05.125,Look at me.
01:15:07.336,01:15:10.839,"Ethan, at least show me the courtesy of looking at me when I'm talking to you."
01:15:18.472,01:15:19.932,I intercepted Davian's call.
01:15:20.015,01:15:22.601,I know he wants the Rabbit's Foot for Julia's life.
01:15:24.728,01:15:25.687,"It's just, uh..."
01:15:28.524,01:15:31.860,This is so disappointing.
01:15:32.486,01:15:36.240,Go to Shangahi. Feng Shan Apartments -- 1406.
01:15:41.203,01:15:44.831,"I wish there was, uh, something I could do to help you, but..."
01:15:50.254,01:15:51.380,Take him to the holding cell.
01:17:05.954,01:17:07.080,"No, I'm on it."
01:17:07.831,01:17:09.625,"Yes, sir. There's no need to panic. I'll get him back."
01:17:09.708,01:17:10.709,Sir? Ethan Hunt...
01:17:10.792,01:17:12.085,I know what happened. Give me the radio.
01:17:12.502,01:17:15.047,This is Director Brassel. Ethan Hunt is attempting to escape the building.
01:17:15.130,01:17:17.215,He's in the west cargo elevator. He must be stopped.
01:17:17.299,01:17:19.843,I want Mendoza and Graham in the situation room right away.
01:17:20.469,01:17:22.095,"I'm having the building surrounded, sir."
01:17:22.179,01:17:23.597,I've got units posted at all the entrances.
01:17:24.848,01:17:27.559,I'm ordering a code-six lockdown. I repeat.
01:17:27.643,01:17:29.561,-It's Hunt. -I know it's Hunt.
01:17:31.396,01:17:34.274,Hunt was flagged on sub-basement nine.
01:17:34.358,01:17:37.486,I want all security personnel down there now.
01:17:38.070,01:17:39.529,Security channel's jammed.
01:17:39.821,01:17:41.823,Hunt must be holding down the transmit button.
01:18:06.473,01:18:07.724,You've got to be kidding me.
01:18:21.697,01:18:23.281,now boarding at gate 46.
01:18:26.368,01:18:29.079,Final call for Mr. Bower. Final call for Mr. Bower.
01:18:29.371,01:18:30.664,Please come to gate four.
01:18:32.082,01:18:34.459,-Mr. Pavel Sobo... -Sobotka.
01:18:34.626,01:18:36.086,Sobotka. Okay.
01:18:36.169,01:18:37.379,And you're flying to Shanghai?
01:18:41.216,01:18:43.135,I don't speak Czech. I'm sorry.
01:18:43.510,01:18:44.594,Let's see about your flight.
01:18:44.886,01:18:45.762,Okay.
01:18:46.388,01:18:47.973,-Okay. -Okay.
01:20:26.488,01:20:27.572,Don't kill me.
01:20:29.574,01:20:30.742,I'm sorry.
01:20:32.077,01:20:33.286,I'm sorry.
01:20:35.372,01:20:39.000,Musgrave told us about Julia. We're here to help.
01:20:41.044,01:20:46.508,"According to the plans from Davian's briefcase, it's in a laboratory on the 56th floor of the Hengshan Lu Building."
01:20:47.008,01:20:48.760,Which is a nightmare for just about every reason.
01:20:50.470,01:20:52.264,"We have no pull, no details."
01:20:52.556,01:20:56.560,"The good news is, whatever it is, the Rabbit Foot's small, so we can steal it."
01:20:56.893,01:20:59.771,"The bad news, we got to steal it."
01:21:00.522,01:21:02.899,"From a thief's point of view, this is worst-case scenario."
01:21:03.608,01:21:07.279,The security guards are all privately-contracted former People's Liberation Army.
01:21:07.362,01:21:09.281,The only access to the lab is by private elevator.
01:21:09.364,01:21:12.117,And that can only be activated by persons inside the lab.
01:21:12.200,01:21:14.369,All of it surveilled by security cameras within the building.
01:21:14.953,01:21:16.121,What about the roof?
01:21:17.873,01:21:20.208,Four guards full time. Two on each rooftop.
01:21:22.711,01:21:23.712,That's the one.
01:21:25.171,01:21:26.214,How tall is that building?
01:21:27.591,01:21:29.926,It's 162 meters at the highest point.
01:21:30.010,01:21:31.720,"What about that, the building on the left? How tall is that one?"
01:21:31.803,01:21:33.513,Says 226 meters.
01:21:33.722,01:21:36.057,Two hundred and twenty six. Distance between the buildings?
01:21:36.516,01:21:38.435,Forty seven point fifty five meters across.
01:21:54.951,01:21:56.036,Ethan?
01:21:56.828,01:21:59.247,That's good. I think it's tall enough.
01:22:00.874,01:22:03.001,-For what? -A fulcrum.
01:22:05.587,01:22:08.089,"Oh, y-y-you're gonna swing... N-No, no, no, no. Wait, wait."
01:22:08.590,01:22:09.591,You could bounce right off the roof.
01:22:09.674,01:22:10.717,"Yes, I could."
01:22:10.800,01:22:14.846,"Even if you made it to the rooftop, took out the guards, and got the Rabbit's Foot, you can't just walk out of the lobby."
01:22:14.930,01:22:15.889,What's your exit?
01:22:16.473,01:22:18.058,Base-jump off the top. I need a chute.
01:22:18.391,01:22:20.852,"Even at 162, you're pushing minimum height for a jump."
01:22:20.936,01:22:22.354,Chute opens any lower than that and you're dead.
01:22:23.480,01:22:25.106,Land in the middle of Shanghai and hope no one notices?
01:22:25.190,01:22:26.358,Central Park's two blocks away.
01:22:26.441,01:22:31.529,"Wait, wait, Ethan, I'm not saying I have a better idea, but there's a point where bold becomes stupid."
01:22:31.613,01:22:37.118,"Now, we don't even know what this thing is, and you're talking about handing it over to a guy who provides terrorists with information."
01:22:37.202,01:22:38.870,"Luther, of course I'm not suggesting that we just hand it over."
01:22:38.954,01:22:41.665,We're going to tag the Rabbit's Foot so we can trace it and know where it is.
01:22:41.748,01:22:43.625,"Now, you know we can get that gear here."
01:22:44.417,01:22:45.335,I just deliver it myself.
01:22:45.418,01:22:52.217,"We contact Musgrave, have the IMF trace a tag, order a raid, get the Rabbit's Foot back, grab Davian. Now, if I get out with Julia, we win."
01:22:54.052,01:22:55.345,"If I don't, then, uh..."
01:23:02.185,01:23:04.479,"Look, then she's dead anyway. And so am I."
01:23:06.314,01:23:07.232,You know?
01:23:07.649,01:23:11.861,"Goddamn it, it's 8:11, it's 8:12."
01:23:14.531,01:23:17.492,And we have two hours before they kill my wife.
01:23:18.493,01:23:19.661,Are you in or not?
01:23:27.836,01:23:29.045,Of course we're in.
01:24:01.995,01:24:03.163,You got 18 minutes.
01:24:06.041,01:24:07.625,You're going to make it over there.
01:24:08.043,01:24:14.799,"You're going to find the Rabbit's Foot, get back to the roof, radio me when you're ready to make the jump, and we're going to come get you."
01:24:16.801,01:24:17.844,Thank you for coming.
01:24:19.345,01:24:20.638,That's my job.
01:24:57.258,01:24:58.468,Batter up.
01:25:26.246,01:25:28.915,"Oh, yeah. They're freaking out. Hit them again."
01:27:04.302,01:27:05.303,Okay.
01:27:08.056,01:27:09.015,He made it.
01:27:12.518,01:27:13.686,I knew he'd make it.
01:27:28.868,01:27:30.703,I'm going in. I'll be out in five minutes.
01:27:40.046,01:27:41.547,-It's been 12 minutes. -He's got five minutes left.
01:27:42.423,01:27:45.551,"If he doesn't call Davian in five minutes, Julia's dead."
01:27:49.055,01:27:49.973,Negative.
01:27:52.267,01:27:53.393,"No, nothing."
01:27:53.851,01:27:55.103,"Come on, Ethan."
01:28:04.696,01:28:05.571,What is that?
01:28:11.327,01:28:15.415,"When I was little I had a cat, and he used to run away all the time."
01:28:17.166,01:28:19.127,And it's just a prayer I'd say to bring him home.
01:28:22.130,01:28:23.131,Teach it to me.
01:28:26.718,01:28:27.760,but I can't make it to the roof.
01:28:28.261,01:28:29.721,What the hell do you mean you can't make it to the roof?
01:28:29.804,01:28:30.722,Where are you?
01:28:30.805,01:28:32.098,"Look up! Look up, look up!"
01:28:35.852,01:28:37.312,"-Oh, shit. -He's way too low."
01:30:28.548,01:30:31.342,Ethan! Get in! They're coming!
01:30:31.425,01:30:32.260,Who?
01:30:32.343,01:30:33.427,"Building security, and they're pissed."
01:30:37.014,01:30:38.432,"Okay. Go, go, go, go."
01:30:45.731,01:30:46.899,How much time you got left?
01:30:48.109,01:30:49.110,Less than two minutes.
01:30:56.242,01:30:57.994,You gotta get us out of here. I lost the signal.
01:31:02.039,01:31:03.583,-You okay? -Not yet.
01:31:20.933,01:31:22.268,I don't have a signal. I don't have a signal.
01:31:22.351,01:31:23.519,I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it!
01:31:32.236,01:31:33.154,Zhen!
01:31:35.406,01:31:36.532,Damn it. I'm sorry.
01:31:45.333,01:31:46.250,Put pressure on it.
01:31:47.460,01:31:48.502,Tell me when you get a signal.
01:31:48.753,01:31:49.795,What are you doing?
01:32:09.649,01:32:10.775,I got a signal!
01:32:15.529,01:32:16.489,Hit redial.
01:32:21.786,01:32:24.121,The Rabbit's Foot. I have it.
01:32:24.330,01:32:26.582,The train yard at Dunan Zhong Lu.
01:32:27.250,01:32:28.459,Wait for me there. Alone.
01:32:31.671,01:32:32.546,Yeah?
01:32:33.547,01:32:34.465,We are.
01:32:37.843,01:32:39.637,-You okay? -I'm tagging it now.
01:32:42.974,01:32:44.976,You need to run a trace. Make sure we have eyes on this thing.
01:32:45.476,01:32:46.352,What's the tag?
01:32:46.435,01:32:48.312,Six-three-nine-six-four-one.
01:32:49.230,01:32:50.273,Got it.
01:32:53.401,01:32:54.735,I see you on Luang Tao Lu Road.
01:32:54.819,01:32:57.238,"If you don't hear from me in eight hours, you send an army after this thing."
01:32:58.239,01:32:59.657,"-Good luck. -You, too."
01:33:11.836,01:33:13.296,you sent a team to the Far East.
01:33:13.921,01:33:17.300,We received intel that Hadaam Saleen Bahar was en route to Shanghai.
01:33:17.508,01:33:19.468,-Hadaam Saleen Bahar. -That's right.
01:33:19.802,01:33:21.887,You know what I'd love? I'd love to see that intel.
01:33:21.971,01:33:23.097,I'll be in my office.
01:33:23.431,01:33:24.348,"Yes, sir."
01:33:38.863,01:33:39.989,I'll see you back home.
01:33:41.699,01:33:42.658,Ethan.
01:33:44.285,01:33:46.245,You know they probably plan to kill you both.
01:33:48.873,01:33:50.499,Then I won't see you back home.
01:33:52.585,01:33:53.627,Better get back.
01:34:41.133,01:34:43.260,Drink it. No questions.
01:35:47.158,01:35:48.159,Good morning.
01:36:04.592,01:36:05.634,Jules.
01:36:07.052,01:36:08.888,We've put an explosive charge in your head.
01:36:09.889,01:36:11.098,Does that sound familiar?
01:36:12.683,01:36:14.101,The Rabbit's Foot. Where is it?
01:36:15.644,01:36:16.896,I gave it to you.
01:36:17.855,01:36:26.405,"Now, I'm going to count to ten and you're going to tell me where the Rabbit's Foot is or she dies."
01:36:51.889,01:36:55.267,Seems we have a lot to talk about. Don't we?
01:36:58.979,01:37:00.189,-Do you think I'm playing? -Son of a bitch!
01:37:00.272,01:37:02.483,Do you think I'm playing? You don't think I'll do it?
01:37:02.858,01:37:03.776,Where is it?
01:37:03.859,01:37:05.486,-Look at me. -Where the hell is it?
01:37:05.569,01:37:07.029,-Look at me. Stay with me. -Seven!
01:37:07.112,01:37:10.658,"I am going to kill you. I swear to God I'm going to-- -Eight! -No, please."
01:37:13.202,01:37:16.247,Please. Don't do this. Just let her go.
01:37:17.081,01:37:20.334,I promise you. I promise you.
01:37:20.417,01:37:22.294,I can figure out how to get whatever-- Nine.
01:37:24.088,01:37:26.423,Listen to me. I want to help you get whatever you want.
01:37:27.132,01:37:28.467,But you got to do what's right.
01:37:29.718,01:37:30.803,What you know is right.
01:37:31.762,01:37:32.846,"No, please..."
01:37:35.724,01:37:36.725,No.
01:37:39.103,01:37:39.937,No.
01:37:40.563,01:37:41.397,-Ten. -Don't!
01:38:05.296,01:38:07.298,I've got some questions I want to ask him first.
01:38:30.738,01:38:31.989,It's complicated.
01:38:39.204,01:38:40.998,You can't just open the canister.
01:38:41.540,01:38:43.584,We had to make sure you brought the real thing.
01:38:44.501,01:38:47.630,The Rabbit's Foot. Now we know.
01:38:56.680,01:38:59.683,Don't you touch her! Don't you touch her!
01:39:09.151,01:39:12.488,"Davian's translator, his Head of Security."
01:39:13.864,01:39:14.990,Remember?
01:39:15.532,01:39:16.992,"At the Vatican, she failed him."
01:39:19.411,01:39:23.290,"Ethan, Julia is still alive."
01:39:24.375,01:39:27.044,"Davian wanted to kill you both, but I convinced him otherwise."
01:39:28.295,01:39:30.422,Julia hasn't seen me. She doesn't know anything.
01:39:30.506,01:39:31.340,She's clean.
01:39:32.424,01:39:33.842,She can go on to have a life.
01:39:35.094,01:39:39.390,"As long as you tell me, what was in Lindsey's message?"
01:39:40.641,01:39:43.143,I know she sent you a microdot from Berlin.
01:39:44.978,01:39:46.814,Did Lindsey know about me and Davian?
01:39:47.398,01:39:49.942,Is that why she sent the message to you? Did you read it?
01:39:50.526,01:39:52.027,Did anyone else see it?
01:39:52.152,01:39:54.071,Did she know about the work I was doing?
01:39:54.655,01:39:56.365,Could I be compromised at IMF?
01:39:59.785,01:40:01.704,Did she buy that Brassel set her up?
01:40:02.246,01:40:03.247,Did she buy that?
01:40:05.249,01:40:06.458,You told him.
01:40:08.043,01:40:10.212,That's how Davian knew Lindsey was coming.
01:40:10.587,01:40:11.922,You told him.
01:40:14.133,01:40:15.634,I thought you could get her back.
01:40:16.552,01:40:20.180,"But I wasn't gonna let Brassel, of all people, undo the work I'd done."
01:40:20.264,01:40:24.268,"I took action, Ethan, on behalf of the working families of our country."
01:40:24.643,01:40:26.186,"The Armed Forces, the White House."
01:40:26.270,01:40:28.188,I'd had enough of Brassel and his sanctimony.
01:40:28.272,01:40:31.358,IMF Executive Director. He's an affirmative action poster boy.
01:40:31.775,01:40:35.154,"You grab Davian like he wanted, then what?"
01:40:35.904,01:40:37.281,Davian's a weed.
01:40:39.199,01:40:42.035,"You cut him out, two more spring up just like him the next day."
01:40:43.412,01:40:45.038,Arrest him? Then what?
01:40:46.707,01:40:47.916,You use him.
01:40:49.626,01:40:52.087,Collaborate with him.
01:40:53.797,01:40:55.674,And it's Christmas.
01:40:57.676,01:41:03.474,"In 18 hours, the Rabbit's Foot will be delivered to its Middle Eastern buyer, and we'll have credible intel to prove it."
01:41:03.974,01:41:06.894,US Security Council will get a report by this time tomorrow.
01:41:07.102,01:41:09.646,We're talking a military strike within a week.
01:41:10.481,01:41:14.943,"And when the sand settles, our country will do what it does best."
01:41:15.736,01:41:18.238,Clean up. Infrastructure.
01:41:19.990,01:41:21.200,Democracy wins.
01:41:26.079,01:41:28.540,What was Lindsey's message?
01:41:29.958,01:41:32.878,"You tell me, and Julia walks."
01:41:35.881,01:41:37.549,It's the only play you have left.
01:41:39.551,01:41:42.930,"Not till I hear her voice, know she's alive."
01:41:45.015,01:41:46.058,Of course.
01:41:59.530,01:42:00.572,Put her on.
01:42:08.539,01:42:09.373,Jules?
01:42:10.999,01:42:14.169,"When we met, there was a lake near the mountain."
01:42:16.380,01:42:17.422,What was the lake called?
01:42:21.593,01:42:22.719,"Please, Ethan."
01:42:23.220,01:42:24.054,Jules.
01:42:45.200,01:42:46.285,Benjamin Dunne.
01:42:47.536,01:42:48.787,"Benji, it's me. Ethan."
01:42:48.871,01:42:51.832,What? No. Really?
01:42:55.252,01:42:57.838,I need to trace the location of the last call made from this phone.
01:42:58.630,01:43:00.048,"Look, no. Ethan. Shush."
01:43:02.134,01:43:05.053,Everyone I know. They're looking... I--I j-just looked it up.
01:43:05.220,01:43:07.264,"Okay, you're on Interpol's most wanted list."
01:43:07.347,01:43:09.641,"And that, by the way, is a spectacular list to be on."
01:43:09.725,01:43:12.185,"Whatever happened, I'm sorry, but I'm hanging up now right now."
01:43:12.269,01:43:13.353,"Benji, I don't have time for this."
01:43:13.645,01:43:15.355,What do you think happened? I've been set up.
01:43:15.439,01:43:18.650,"I think, I think I like my job. Okay? A lot."
01:43:18.734,01:43:20.485,All right? And you know they're gonna be taping this call.
01:43:20.694,01:43:21.862,And you know you can erase it.
01:43:21.945,01:43:23.280,I'm giving you the number right now.
01:43:23.530,01:43:25.782,-Are you ready? -All right. Just hang on.
01:43:25.866,01:43:27.868,"I'm gonna lose my citizenship because of this, you know."
01:43:28.201,01:43:31.371,Seven-three-four-four-two- five-six-four-three-six-seven.
01:43:31.455,01:43:33.957,"Okay. Wait. Okay. Just hold the line, please."
01:43:48.347,01:43:49.806,-Are you there? -Yeah.
01:43:52.017,01:43:54.811,"Maybe we can, uh, share a jail cell together, you know?"
01:43:55.187,01:43:56.897,"If this all goes tits up, which it will."
01:43:57.731,01:43:59.691,The location of that number is Shanghai.
01:43:59.775,01:44:01.193,"There, I just told you. Shanghai."
01:44:01.276,01:44:03.904,I've just aided and abetted an enemy of the state. Fantastic. Thank you.
01:44:03.987,01:44:06.114,Am I close? Use this phone to track my location.
01:44:06.198,01:44:08.700,"Oh, you're there. Well, you're, you're, you're, you're close."
01:44:08.784,01:44:10.327,How close? Is the signal in the building?
01:44:10.661,01:44:12.454,"No, no, no. It isn't coming from there."
01:44:12.537,01:44:14.247,It's in a building one mile to the northeast.
01:44:31.932,01:44:33.475,I'll tell you when I see you.
01:44:42.818,01:44:45.070,"What you, you, you, you, you need to go north."
01:44:45.153,01:44:47.364,"Okay, there's a bridge. Uh, get to it, cross it."
01:44:47.447,01:44:49.992,Make a left. Go three-quarters of a mile along the river.
01:44:50.826,01:44:51.910,I got it. I got it.
01:45:28.155,01:45:30.032,"Good, good. That's right. Keep going. Keep going."
01:45:30.115,01:45:31.491,Make your next left and then the next one.
01:45:31.575,01:45:33.118,"And then follow that down 1,000 yards."
01:45:33.201,01:45:34.244,A thousand yards.
01:45:34.953,01:45:36.413,"Okay. Okay, okay."
01:45:38.874,01:45:40.625,"Yeah, that's good. That's good. Keep going. Keep going."
01:45:40.709,01:45:43.003,"Okay, now look... Hiya. Hi."
01:45:44.921,01:45:46.423,Benji? Which way do I go?
01:45:46.506,01:45:47.340,Now take a right.
01:45:53.972,01:45:55.307,"Okay. Go down, left."
01:45:55.766,01:45:57.350,Left? I'm going left.
01:46:00.479,01:46:02.272,It's in the second building on your left.
01:46:02.564,01:46:06.276,The signal bearing's plus or minus three meters from the northeast corner.
01:46:06.651,01:46:07.652,I owe you.
01:48:05.437,01:48:07.272,Jules. Jules.
01:48:07.898,01:48:09.274,You're gonna be okay.
01:48:12.611,01:48:13.653,"Oh, God!"
01:48:14.321,01:48:15.238,God!
01:48:26.166,01:48:27.834,I've activate the charge in your head.
01:48:34.341,01:48:36.051,You have maybe four minutes left.
01:48:45.977,01:48:47.479,Didn't I tell you she'd call out your name?
01:48:54.778,01:48:57.572,Ethan. Ethan.
01:49:14.047,01:49:16.174,And I told you I was going to kill you in front of her?
01:49:17.509,01:49:19.135,"Well, I'm going to kill her in front of you."
01:51:16.920,01:51:17.879,Are you okay?
01:51:19.714,01:51:21.341,"I don't understand what's going on, Ethan."
01:51:21.424,01:51:22.675,I know. I know. Just wait.
01:51:22.759,01:51:24.094,What do those men want from you?
01:51:24.177,01:51:26.846,Why are we here? How did you find me?
01:51:28.181,01:51:29.891,"Please, Ethan. What the hell is going on?"
01:51:31.226,01:51:32.310,Are you okay?
01:51:32.560,01:51:35.980,"Ethan, what's wrong? Okay. Oh, God."
01:51:39.818,01:51:43.029,I'm going to tell you everything. You just stay with me.
01:51:50.078,01:51:52.372,Ethan. What's happening? What are you looking for?
01:51:53.248,01:51:55.417,-We've got to get out of here. -Not yet.
01:51:57.710,01:51:58.586,They don't have one.
01:51:58.670,01:51:59.504,What?
01:51:59.629,01:52:01.589,-A defibrillator. -A defibrillator?
01:52:02.173,01:52:03.216,Ethan?
01:52:03.675,01:52:05.677,Ethan? Who are these people?
01:52:05.927,01:52:07.220,What the hell are we doing here?
01:52:10.515,01:52:11.433,Good!
01:52:13.184,01:52:15.061,This is a Beretta 92F.
01:52:16.020,01:52:17.939,"It's a very accurate, close-range weapon."
01:52:18.022,01:52:18.940,Don't point it at me.
01:52:19.023,01:52:19.941,Sorry.
01:52:22.318,01:52:23.611,It holds 15 rounds.
01:52:23.695,01:52:26.781,"When the mag is empty, the slide will lock back like this."
01:52:27.115,01:52:28.533,How do you know so much about this?
01:52:29.492,01:52:31.995,"To reload, push this button."
01:52:32.537,01:52:40.044,"The empty mag falls out and you shove the other one in, like the batteries in the flashlight in the kitchen, then release the slide."
01:52:43.965,01:52:45.967,-Why are you giving me a gun? -There could be others.
01:52:46.092,01:52:47.719,"If you have to use it, you stay low."
01:52:47.802,01:52:50.472,You identify your enemy. Point and shoot.
01:52:51.055,01:52:52.932,It's very simple. Point and shoot. Stand back.
01:52:55.643,01:52:56.561,Good.
01:52:58.021,01:52:59.147,I have a charge in my head.
01:52:59.481,01:53:00.648,I'm going to die unless you kill me.
01:53:00.732,01:53:02.484,-What? -Throw the switch on and off.
01:53:02.817,01:53:04.402,-Don't forget the off. -I can't do that.
01:53:04.486,01:53:06.696,You can bring me back. I'll come back.
01:53:06.863,01:53:09.032,-I can't. -You have to! There's no time!
01:53:09.115,01:53:10.408,Now! Please!
01:53:17.457,01:53:20.001,"Wait, wait! Wait. Wait. I love you."
01:53:20.376,01:53:21.503,I love you.
01:54:36.786,01:54:37.954,"Oh, God."
01:54:44.294,01:54:45.461,"Come on, baby."
01:54:50.008,01:54:56.514,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen."
01:55:05.106,01:55:06.649,I need you to come back.
01:55:08.192,01:55:09.527,I need you back.
01:55:55.949,01:55:57.075,"Oh, God."
01:56:06.501,01:56:07.335,You did that?
01:56:12.048,01:56:13.049,Wow.
01:56:44.414,01:56:47.125,I was thinking you might want to tell me why we're in China.
01:56:49.794,01:56:50.878,I know.
01:56:55.216,01:56:56.217,I...
01:56:58.136,01:56:59.429,I work for an agency.
01:57:01.097,01:57:02.265,It's called IMF.
01:57:05.393,01:57:06.686,What does that stand for?
01:57:08.604,01:57:10.273,Impossible Mission Force.
01:57:13.735,01:57:14.861,"No, I'm not kidding."
01:57:15.319,01:57:16.195,You don't understand.
01:57:16.279,01:57:17.572,Everything I'm telling you is top-secret.
01:57:34.172,01:57:37.008,Call it reparations for anything I might have put you through.
01:57:38.426,01:57:40.428,You should know the White House has contacted me.
01:57:40.636,01:57:45.600,"Now, there's a job that they are very interested in speaking with you about."
01:57:49.687,01:57:54.275,"Thank you, but I have a lot to think about."
01:57:54.358,01:57:56.319,"You aren't considering quitting, are you, Ethan?"
01:57:56.861,01:57:59.197,I'm considering going on my honeymoon.
01:58:03.159,01:58:04.368,-Have fun. -Thank you.
01:58:04.452,01:58:05.453,Yeah.
01:58:07.330,01:58:08.664,"Hey, uh, one thing."
01:58:10.458,01:58:12.752,The Rabbit's Foot. What is it?
01:58:16.214,01:58:17.632,"Promise me you'll stay, I'll tell you."
01:58:21.427,01:58:22.512,I'll send you a postcard.
01:58:23.429,01:58:24.347,Fair enough.
