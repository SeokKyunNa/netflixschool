01:24:12.583,01:24:14.625,Always.
01:24:15.333,01:24:18.000,We are family.
01:24:18.083,01:24:19.291,Always.
01:33:23.208,01:33:25.708,What happened to your amazing job?
00:00:23.583,00:00:55.041,Reminder. Audition-- Come on.
00:01:12.291,00:01:13.416,Oh!
00:01:26.500,00:01:27.416,Thank you!
00:01:27.500,00:01:28.708,This is my taxi!
00:01:28.791,00:01:30.375,This is a matter of life and death.
00:01:36.166,00:01:37.250,Oh!
00:02:21.166,00:02:22.291,Be fierce!
00:02:23.958,00:02:24.833,Work it!
00:02:29.500,00:02:31.125,Yes! Push!
00:02:31.750,00:02:33.000,Push!
00:02:41.583,00:02:42.750,Sixteen.
00:02:44.541,00:02:46.583,And 22.
00:02:52.458,00:02:53.500,You're cut.
00:02:55.083,00:02:55.916,Collette?
00:02:56.000,00:02:58.583,"One moment, ladies. I'll be right back."
00:03:01.583,00:03:03.833,Ruth Zimmer would like to take a look at you.
00:03:04.083,00:03:05.208,She's coming in now.
00:03:18.208,00:03:19.250,She would.
00:03:21.458,00:03:24.875,"So, you're a really good dancer, are you?"
00:03:24.958,00:03:27.458,I'll bet you're really good. You look like you are.
00:03:28.416,00:03:34.166,Like you put every hour of every day into sharpening every skill and every move so you can be perfect.
00:03:34.750,00:03:46.166,"But missy, your dreams will never come true, because as long as I live, and I've got a lot of years left, I will make sure that you are never hired for any show, on Broadway, Off-Broadway or Off-Off-Broadway."
00:03:46.625,00:03:49.083,"Your career is over, chorus girl."
00:03:49.500,00:03:51.875,"-Miss Zimmer, please-- -Bring back your next choice, Collette."
00:03:51.958,00:03:52.791,I can explain.
00:03:52.875,00:03:54.916,-That won't be necessary. -You're done.
00:03:55.166,00:03:57.208,"-Miss Zimmer, please, could you just let-- -Let go."
00:03:57.291,00:03:58.125,Please.
00:03:58.208,00:03:59.750,-If you just-- Please. -Let go of me!
00:04:25.375,00:04:27.416,"What, Deco? I've had the worst day."
00:04:27.750,00:04:30.125,I know. I saw it.
00:04:30.750,00:04:33.458,"-What? -Baby girl, you are all over my feed."
00:04:35.333,00:04:36.583,What are you talking about?
00:04:38.250,00:04:39.083,Oh!
00:04:48.625,00:04:49.916,That wasn't my fault.
00:04:51.000,00:04:55.291,"-She slipped and fell. -Yes, and she broke her leg and her wrist."
00:04:55.375,00:04:57.166,"Oh, look. Another person retweeted it to me."
00:04:57.250,00:04:59.250,How many people have watched this? A couple hundred?
00:05:03.250,00:05:04.208,This can't be happening.
00:05:05.875,00:05:08.458,"She doesn't actually have the power to end my career, right?"
00:05:09.375,00:05:11.791,Just because she's one of the biggest money people on Broadway?
00:05:12.500,00:05:13.583,Please.
00:05:23.375,00:05:30.833,"Hi, this is April, for-- Hello?"
00:05:31.333,00:05:32.166,Hello?
00:05:34.666,00:05:35.708,They hung up.
00:05:35.833,00:05:39.958,"It was really nice knowing you. I mean, have fun teaching Jazzercise."
00:05:40.375,00:05:42.500,No. There's gotta be someone who isn't afraid of her.
00:05:42.916,00:05:47.291,"-Someone who'll cast whoever they want. -No, honey. Everybody's afraid of her."
00:05:48.750,00:05:49.833,Not him.
00:05:52.125,00:05:53.208,Not Welly Wong.
00:05:54.083,00:05:54.958,Okay.
00:05:55.041,00:05:59.333,"And without an agent, how do you expect to get in front of Welly Wong?"
00:06:11.458,00:06:15.083,"Nicole, you're saying, Have auditions, I'm telling you I will."
00:06:26.083,00:06:26.958,to communicate...
00:06:27.541,00:06:30.958,I'm looking for a specific mix of talent and loveliness.
00:06:31.041,00:06:32.375,You know what I mean? No!
00:06:32.458,00:06:33.375,Look harder.
00:06:40.791,00:07:23.125,"David, they're totally on my case about this so it looks like we have to clear a day sometime next week, to find our dancer. We have to find a star, Hey, Dad."
00:07:23.208,00:07:24.958,There she is. What's new?
00:07:26.166,00:07:29.500,"Not much, you know. Just-- Paying my dues."
00:07:29.583,00:07:32.041,"It'll happen. You've got the talent, sweetie."
00:07:32.958,00:07:34.916,Are you... out in the hallway?
00:07:35.708,00:07:36.708,"Yeah, um..."
00:07:37.875,00:07:39.208,I'm just waiting for my takeout.
00:07:40.375,00:07:43.000,Doing all right otherwise? Do you need anything?
00:07:43.291,00:07:44.458,No. All good.
00:07:45.291,00:07:48.500,"Oh, but my food's here, so I should probably-- Yeah, okay."
00:07:49.375,00:07:51.000,"Call me later, whenever you get a chance."
00:07:51.083,00:07:51.958,"Yeah, I will."
00:07:53.041,00:07:53.875,Bye.
00:08:19.000,00:08:20.375,You heard from Mom lately?
00:08:21.875,00:08:22.750,Nope.
00:08:28.166,00:08:30.666,"Or people back here either, I would die."
00:08:31.541,00:08:33.375,Don't get too full of yourself.
00:08:34.083,00:08:36.666,People around here have other things to worry about.
00:08:38.875,00:08:41.875,It's probably just me with a Google alert on you.
00:08:50.791,00:08:51.791,-Go Churners. -Great!
00:08:51.875,00:08:53.625,"This rate, we'll be the slowest football team."
00:08:53.708,00:08:56.416,"-RJ, pick up the pace. -I'm trying my best, coach."
00:08:58.166,00:08:59.625,"You too, Goldilocks, come on."
00:09:02.458,00:09:04.041,"-Buzz. -Pick up your feet! Hey, Frank."
00:09:04.125,00:09:04.958,How you doing?
00:09:06.208,00:09:07.708,You call that a run? Let's go.
00:09:13.791,00:09:15.500,Has anyone moved into your old store?
00:09:16.625,00:09:17.666,No.
00:09:17.750,00:09:21.250,"Stupid pharmacy chain, putting us little guys out of business."
00:09:21.333,00:09:22.833,At least they gave you a job.
00:09:23.375,00:09:25.333,"Yeah, part-time but..."
00:09:26.458,00:09:28.000,"I really blew it, Dad."
00:09:30.166,00:09:31.625,Such a failure.
00:09:33.708,00:09:35.333,You know what will make you feel better?
00:09:35.708,00:09:36.666,Cheese.
00:09:41.583,00:09:44.541,-Mmm-- -April! Oh!
00:09:49.291,00:09:51.833,"Well, I was just getting snacks for the pep rally. Go Churners!"
00:09:51.916,00:09:55.041,"-Go Churners! -And I thought, Is that April?"
00:09:55.125,00:10:02.375,"But then I go, Well, that can't be April because April is in NYC. And yet, here you are! Oh, my God!"
00:10:02.458,00:10:04.208,Oh! I just saw Nick.
00:10:04.291,00:10:06.375,"Well, how funny is that?"
00:10:06.541,00:10:07.541,Nick's here?
00:10:07.791,00:10:08.791,"Oh, my gosh."
00:10:08.875,00:10:13.333,"It's just like old times. I mean, you know, minus you two being joined at the lips..."
00:10:15.916,00:10:18.458,I cannot believe you are standing right in front of me.
00:10:18.541,00:10:19.375,Oh!
00:10:19.833,00:10:23.958,"You remember my little one, June?"
00:10:24.250,00:10:27.708,"Yeah, she was in Pampers the last time that you saw her. Junie."
00:10:27.791,00:10:29.375,This is who I've been talking about.
00:10:30.208,00:10:33.708,"Yeah, the high school's all-time greatest cheerleader. Go Churners!"
00:10:34.916,00:10:37.375,And Mommy's biggest success story.
00:10:37.833,00:10:39.875,She is a Broadway star!
00:10:40.583,00:10:42.250,"Oh, my gosh."
00:10:43.166,00:10:46.916,"Oh, my gosh, you have to come by the studio and say hi to the girls!"
00:10:47.833,00:10:49.166,I would love to.
00:10:49.250,00:10:50.208,Great!
00:10:50.291,00:10:51.916,But my dad's been sick.
00:10:52.000,00:10:54.208,"-Who's sick? -Oh, no. Frank, are you sick?"
00:10:54.291,00:10:55.500,"-Yeah... -Oh, my God."
00:10:55.583,00:10:57.041,"Well, I'll make you a casserole."
00:10:57.125,00:10:59.375,That's what I'm gonna do. Okay.
00:10:59.458,00:11:09.083,"Well, it was just so, so wonderful to... see you, and I just-- The girls will just-- They'll be so disappointed not to meet you, but-- I know, it's such a shame."
00:11:09.166,00:11:12.541,Let's not disappoint the girls. She'll be happy to meet them.
00:11:20.083,00:11:23.125,I'll see you at 5:30.
00:11:23.375,00:11:24.500,"Take care of yourself, Frank."
00:11:24.583,00:11:25.625,Super.
00:11:27.583,00:11:29.208,Would it have killed you to play sick?
00:11:53.125,00:11:54.583,Make sure you have everything.
00:11:54.666,00:11:55.583,Bye!
00:11:58.625,00:12:01.541,"Hey, Sarah. Don't forget to help Michelle with her shoes, okay?"
00:12:02.416,00:12:03.666,"You don't have to tell me, Nick."
00:12:05.250,00:12:06.083,"See you, guys."
00:12:06.541,00:12:08.833,"Whoo! I bet you don't miss those stairs, huh?"
00:12:08.916,00:12:11.166,"Oh! Look, we put your picture on the wall."
00:12:11.250,00:12:13.833,"Honey, don't worry about that right now."
00:12:14.041,00:12:15.916,The little genius balances my books.
00:12:16.000,00:12:18.041,But I owe you this shift for my classes this week.
00:12:20.250,00:12:21.916,"Come on, help me get all the girls together."
00:12:22.000,00:12:24.375,We have a special guest tonight. You know what?
00:12:24.458,00:12:27.208,"Actually, will you please get a chair for Miss April?"
00:12:31.583,00:12:37.875,"I know I only taught you for eight years, three months and 22 days before you ended up studying in Milwaukee for real."
00:12:37.958,00:12:45.750,"But, you know, I kind of like to think I still had something to do with you becoming a Broadway sensation."
00:12:46.958,00:12:49.625,"Ooh! Speaking of which, let me plant a seed."
00:12:49.708,00:12:52.958,"While you're home visiting, maybe you could teach a master class?"
00:12:53.708,00:12:54.916,Or three?
00:12:55.083,00:13:02.458,"Yeah, let me get back to you-- Because I was thinking, for next year, maybe, doing one of these."
00:13:03.041,00:13:05.208,-A dance competition. -Yes!
00:13:05.458,00:13:06.750,-Wow! -Yeah!
00:13:06.833,00:13:16.500,"Oh, and you know, this one has a special category called the Teacher Feature, where the teacher, gets to perform with her students! Isn't that adorable?"
00:13:16.583,00:13:24.958,"I mean, of course, this year's first round is this weekend, and even though we've been working on a few routines, we are nowhere near this level or even remotely ready."
00:13:25.125,00:13:29.333,"My dad is in the truck and-- Oh, my gosh, Frank!"
00:13:30.333,00:13:31.333,I completely forgot.
00:13:31.416,00:13:33.208,-I gotta make him a casserole. -Yeah.
00:13:33.291,00:13:35.041,"-We've to get him to bed, don't we? -We do."
00:13:35.125,00:13:39.541,"Okay. So, here we go. Well, just a little quick..."
00:13:43.708,00:13:44.541,Sarah?
00:13:47.333,00:13:48.583,What are you doing here?
00:13:49.541,00:13:51.583,You look so much...
00:13:52.333,00:13:53.250,older.
00:13:58.958,00:14:01.333,"Oh, my goodness."
00:14:01.416,00:14:10.083,"I want you to welcome a very special guest, straight from Broadway, Miss April!"
00:14:17.416,00:14:18.708,Right. You remember coach Buzz.
00:14:18.791,00:14:22.208,He leaves his son here while he's at practice. Dicky!
00:14:22.666,00:14:24.500,Honey. Sh! Sh!
00:14:25.041,00:14:26.833,Just while his sister's in class.
00:14:27.875,00:14:29.958,"All right. Questions, anyone?"
00:14:30.041,00:14:30.875,Okay.
00:14:30.958,00:14:35.583,"-Ruby. -First off, I made this, and I want you to have it."
00:14:39.291,00:14:41.291,"Second off, I want you to wear it."
00:14:51.625,00:14:52.833,"Uh, Zuzu."
00:14:53.458,00:14:56.333,How old were you when you started dancing?
00:14:56.833,00:14:58.458,-She's deaf? -Mm-hmm.
00:14:59.041,00:15:00.583,How does she dance on the beat?
00:15:04.291,00:15:05.833,I feel the vibrations.
00:15:05.916,00:15:06.833,Um...
00:15:07.375,00:15:08.208,Kari.
00:15:08.291,00:15:10.416,How did you get to dance on Broadway?
00:15:10.500,00:15:12.125,Hard work. Next.
00:15:15.583,00:15:18.041,does the most talented dancer always get the part?
00:15:18.166,00:15:19.833,Nope. Next.
00:15:19.916,00:15:20.833,Lucia.
00:15:22.083,00:15:24.791,-What was I gonna say? -Next.
00:15:27.375,00:15:28.750,"As a matter of fact, um..."
00:15:31.500,00:15:33.750,I just got a part...
00:15:37.416,00:15:39.000,-What do you play? -What's the show about?
00:15:47.000,00:15:49.125,You guys wanna know how to get on Broadway?
00:15:50.541,00:15:51.541,Simple.
00:15:51.625,00:15:54.375,Never make a mistake in front of anyone important.
00:15:56.833,00:16:00.250,"But the thing is, you-- You don't really know who the important people are."
00:16:00.333,00:16:03.500,"So, really, you can't make a mistake in front of anyone."
00:16:05.958,00:16:08.291,And nothing can help you. Nothing.
00:16:09.708,00:16:10.958,Not even your little pig.
00:16:15.000,00:16:28.083,"plus... talent, I'd say you have a solid point zero, zero, zero, zero one percent chance of making it."
00:16:32.083,00:16:32.916,Nope?
00:16:33.750,00:16:34.583,Great.
00:16:35.791,00:16:37.708,"Well, it's been thrilling, really."
00:16:37.791,00:16:43.708,Thank you for those inspiring yet realistic words!
00:16:49.750,00:16:52.375,"Hey, look who I ran into."
00:16:56.375,00:16:57.583,What are you doing here?
00:16:58.041,00:17:01.250,"My sisters, you know, Sarah and Michelle."
00:17:01.416,00:17:03.416,Did they wipe your memory while you were in New York?
00:17:03.500,00:17:04.583,"No, I know."
00:17:05.125,00:17:07.750,But what are you doing back home?
00:17:10.208,00:17:11.208,Uh...
00:17:13.791,00:17:15.375,She's back 'cause I'm sick.
00:17:15.916,00:17:17.291,"Oh, I didn't know."
00:17:22.833,00:17:23.833,I'm gonna go.
00:17:23.916,00:17:25.791,-I'm gonna go rest in my truck. -Yeah.
00:17:27.041,00:17:29.041,"Thanks, Dad."
00:17:30.916,00:17:31.875,So...
00:17:32.458,00:17:33.333,So...
00:17:35.250,00:17:36.125,So...
00:17:37.083,00:17:37.958,So.
00:17:38.458,00:17:39.708,"So, how are you, Nick?"
00:17:39.791,00:17:40.666,I'm great.
00:17:41.083,00:17:42.333,How you been? Busy.
00:17:42.416,00:17:45.458,"Yeah, you know, my grandma has been getting a little forgetful."
00:17:45.541,00:17:52.583,"So, I've been taking over more with my sisters, on top of my job, and the classes, you know, just doing the grown-up thing."
00:17:52.916,00:18:00.708,"Oh, by the way, your dad is still on me to, uh, fix the barn from the time we, uh, accidentally started that fire."
00:18:03.208,00:18:09.833,"Since I'm back for a bit, and clearly we're gonna run into each other a lot, I need to say that..."
00:18:12.750,00:18:23.333,"...I know I broke your heart when I ended things, not in the most thoughtful way, -and I-- -Sorry to do this in a text, but we have to break up. Ape."
00:18:23.625,00:18:25.541,"See, it was very thoughtfully worded."
00:18:27.041,00:18:34.041,"I just wanna make sure that if, you know, there are any hard feelings -that we can-- -Oh, April, April, April, April, April."
00:18:36.625,00:18:38.000,Did I say something funny?
00:18:38.083,00:18:40.041,"No, no, no. It's just, uh..."
00:18:40.833,00:18:43.875,"Look, Ape, that was high school."
00:18:44.458,00:18:45.333,It's history.
00:18:45.958,00:18:48.791,"Plus, it's not like we were ever gonna last."
00:18:56.625,00:18:57.708,"See you, Frank."
00:18:57.833,00:18:59.500,That barn isn't gonna fix itself.
00:19:04.208,00:19:05.833,"Well, I guess he's over you."
00:19:07.166,00:19:08.833,At least his skin's cleared up.
00:19:14.250,00:19:15.125,What's this?
00:19:16.833,00:19:19.666,I don't know. Some dumb dance competition brochure.
00:19:21.250,00:19:24.541,She actually asked me to teach.
00:19:24.916,00:19:26.833,Can you believe that? To teach.
00:19:26.916,00:19:28.541,"-Well, nice. -No."
00:19:29.250,00:19:34.458,"Not nice, Dad. I-- I'm not gonna teach what I should be doing myself."
00:19:35.500,00:19:37.666,I might as well wear a big fat failure sign.
00:19:37.875,00:19:38.708,Ow.
00:19:38.791,00:19:41.041,"You know, this competition doesn't look so dumb."
00:19:41.125,00:19:44.666,The finals are in Atlantic City with a bunch of muckety-muck judges.
00:19:44.750,00:19:48.166,"Tony Award winner Marissa Jaret Winokur. You're friends with her, right?"
00:19:48.250,00:19:50.000,"I mean, I danced in a benefit she did once."
00:19:50.083,00:19:52.291,I doubt she has any idea who I am.
00:19:52.750,00:20:00.083,"And that ballet dancer, Nadya Khrist-- Crazy long last name, and big Broadway guy Willy Wang."
00:20:01.541,00:20:02.583,Welly Wong?
00:20:04.375,00:20:06.416,-Isn't that what I said? -There's no way. Gimme that.
00:20:12.250,00:20:18.750,Son of a-- And punch.
00:20:18.833,00:20:22.291,"And two, and three, and over your head and five."
00:20:22.375,00:20:26.333,-I'll do it. -And si-- On one condition.
00:20:28.208,00:20:29.958,We go all the way to Atlantic City.
00:20:30.291,00:20:33.000,And I'm gonna choreograph a killer Teacher Feature.
00:20:37.291,00:20:42.375,Welcome to the first day of the DanceDanceDanceDance Dance Competition Season.
00:20:44.875,00:20:47.791,We're very excited to have you all here today.
00:20:47.875,00:20:49.666,"I'm your host, Burt Davenport."
00:20:49.750,00:20:54.791,Let me remind you the national titles are in three months in Atlantic City.
00:20:54.875,00:21:04.833,"Judging the finals, are theatrical phenomenon, Welly Wong, Broadway star, Marissa Jaret Winokur, and prima ballerina Nadya Khristorozhdestvenskaya."
00:21:05.291,00:21:11.375,"We have four studios competing today in various categories, and three will advance to the next round."
00:21:11.458,00:21:14.208,Best of luck to all our competitors.
00:21:59.000,00:21:59.916,I mean...
00:22:03.166,00:22:04.833,Large group dance.
00:22:05.041,00:22:08.875,"From Dewey, Wisconsin, the Dewey Dance-‘Em-All System."
00:22:48.166,00:22:50.041,Do their parents know they dance like that?
00:22:50.125,00:22:55.083,"Whoo! Get it, girl! Make your mommy proud. Bounce. Ha!"
00:22:55.583,00:22:56.750,Apparently so.
00:23:00.625,00:23:04.291,Our reigning State Champs for five straight years now.
00:23:04.625,00:23:06.750,Royalton Conservatory!
00:23:42.708,00:23:44.125,How do they do that?
00:23:58.583,00:23:59.750,They're so clean.
00:24:10.541,00:24:12.583,"Oh, I love it-- Sorry."
00:24:18.833,00:24:20.416,Royalton rules!
00:24:31.666,00:24:33.166,"Ten to 13, jazz."
00:24:36.208,00:24:39.125,Keep your eyes off the ground and stay on the beat. Got it?
00:24:39.416,00:24:41.791,"Nail-biter, smile for Pete's sake."
00:24:46.958,00:24:50.500,I have an aversion to humiliation.
00:24:50.583,00:24:53.833,"Yeah. Compared to them, we suck."
00:24:53.916,00:24:54.875,Look.
00:24:56.208,00:24:57.291,You're scared.
00:24:58.583,00:25:00.291,"I mean, it's your first time onstage."
00:25:00.375,00:25:03.333,"Plus, you've only had five days, I get it, but, uh..."
00:25:03.416,00:25:06.291,we only have to come in third place to make it to the next competition.
00:25:06.375,00:25:09.125,It can't be that difficult. So suck it up and get out there.
00:25:09.208,00:25:10.458,That's your pep talk?
00:25:11.041,00:25:13.875,Grow a pair and do what you and Miss Barb rehearsed.
00:25:13.958,00:25:15.916,Are you dancers or little girls?
00:25:16.000,00:25:17.166,We're little girls.
00:25:21.041,00:25:22.958,The New Hope Dance Studio.
00:25:49.333,00:25:51.791,What's happening? I knew I should have put eyes on this.
00:25:52.958,00:25:53.958,Here we go.
00:26:10.458,00:26:11.875,Bigger.
00:26:15.958,00:26:17.291,Is this a joke?
00:26:56.250,00:26:58.458,Just wait till the Teacher Feature.
00:28:02.041,00:28:03.041,Nailed it.
00:28:18.583,00:28:20.208,But you're missing the whole point.
00:28:20.291,00:28:22.791,It's to showcase the students and what you've taught them.
00:28:22.958,00:28:25.416,It's not about you taking the spotlight.
00:28:45.291,00:28:46.583,-Attagirl. -Hmm?
00:28:59.041,00:29:01.750,About time we had some good news around here.
00:29:21.541,00:29:22.416,Who?
00:29:22.708,00:29:24.625,The DanceDanceDanceDance Dance Competition.
00:29:24.750,00:29:30.083,The Dewey Dance-'Em-All Studio used a ten-year-old in the eight-and-under category.
00:29:30.166,00:29:33.958,-And I should care because-- -You should care because they are disqualified.
00:29:34.500,00:29:35.958,Which means we...
00:29:37.125,00:29:38.291,came in third.
00:29:39.291,00:29:41.833,-We-- We came in third. -We came in third.
00:29:41.916,00:29:44.083,-Yeah. We came in third! -We came in third!
00:29:44.416,00:29:45.458,We came in third!
00:29:45.541,00:29:47.958,Which means we're gonna go on to the next round!
00:29:49.375,00:29:50.583,Oh! Okay.
00:29:57.541,00:29:59.791,"Attention, everybody."
00:29:59.875,00:30:01.541,This is not a drill.
00:30:01.625,00:30:05.666,The New Hope Dancers are back in the competition!
00:30:06.041,00:30:07.958,Whoo!
00:30:08.833,00:30:09.875,Go Churners!
00:30:11.125,00:30:12.333,Go Churners.
00:30:13.833,00:30:19.083,"Gosh, I will just die if we get all the way to Nationals and I get to meet Marissa Jaret Winokur."
00:30:19.166,00:30:21.375,"Oh, I saw her in Hairspray ten times."
00:30:21.458,00:30:25.250,"Oh, that beautiful hair, I just wanna nuzzle it and have her sing me to sl-- Hi!"
00:30:25.333,00:30:27.708,"Kari, do you have that permission slip for the competition?"
00:30:27.833,00:30:31.875,I can just swing by your mom's salon-- No. No. Don't do that. I have it.
00:30:31.958,00:30:33.125,"Oh, great!"
00:30:33.625,00:30:36.375,"Hey, coach asked me to drop Dicky off. So, here you go."
00:30:36.458,00:30:37.416,Okay.
00:30:47.250,00:30:48.541,-Hi. -How was your day?
00:30:51.291,00:30:52.458,Did you have fun?
00:30:53.000,00:30:54.125,Did you have recess?
00:31:00.208,00:31:02.958,"Okay, ladies. Listen up! Somehow, we're still in this thing."
00:31:03.041,00:31:04.958,"But please, let's not fool ourselves."
00:31:05.416,00:31:06.833,We still have a lot of work to do.
00:31:06.916,00:31:08.666,We only need to keep coming third to be in it.
00:31:08.750,00:31:10.375,How are we gonna do that?
00:31:10.458,00:31:12.291,Can you explain how we actually advance rounds?
00:31:12.375,00:31:14.541,"AKA, how do we accumulate points?"
00:31:14.625,00:31:16.541,"Ruby, honey, it's a weighted average per number."
00:31:16.625,00:31:20.333,"So you've got group numbers, solos-- Just do exactly what I say and we'll advance."
00:31:20.416,00:31:21.250,Got it?
00:31:22.000,00:31:24.916,"Now, before we begin, there are three basic ground rules."
00:31:25.000,00:31:26.875,Rule number one: Focus!
00:31:26.958,00:31:29.708,"Clearly no one's ever taught you how. No offense, Miss Barb."
00:31:31.208,00:31:41.166,"So, from now on, anyone who speaks without permission, I'm not kidding."
00:31:42.500,00:31:44.916,Number two: Commitment.
00:31:45.000,00:31:47.500,A dancer without technique is nothing.
00:31:47.583,00:31:50.375,"So, right now, you are nothing."
00:31:53.875,00:31:56.416,Number three: Do...
00:31:56.708,00:31:57.541,exactly...
00:31:58.166,00:31:59.000,what...
00:31:59.291,00:32:00.125,I...
00:32:00.458,00:32:01.333,say.
00:32:02.166,00:32:03.000,Got it?
00:32:04.958,00:32:06.208,-Got it? -Yes.
00:32:06.291,00:32:08.291,"-Yes, Miss April. -Yes, Miss April."
00:32:09.083,00:32:10.541,"Everyone, take a spot at the barre."
00:32:10.625,00:32:11.708,"Yes, Miss April."
00:32:16.291,00:32:18.208,Mommy. I already forgot what rule one is.
00:32:18.291,00:32:19.125,No talking!
00:32:19.208,00:32:22.500,"-Oh, yeah. -Drop and give me 20 push-ups. Now."
00:32:22.625,00:32:23.791,"Yes, Miss April."
00:32:32.166,00:32:34.416,Not a lot of time to whip you guys into shape.
00:32:34.916,00:32:37.500,"So, from now on..."
00:32:38.875,00:32:41.291,"unless you're asleep, or at school..."
00:32:42.708,00:32:43.833,you will be here.
00:32:44.708,00:32:48.041,"Practicing, day in and day out."
00:32:55.333,00:32:58.958,"And side and back, the side to the front."
00:32:59.041,00:33:00.541,-Keep going. Side. -Timing.
00:33:03.666,00:33:05.083,Maybe we should take a little break.
00:33:05.166,00:33:07.000,-They get five minutes at 9:00 p.m. -Okay.
00:33:07.708,00:33:09.083,Feel the beat.
00:33:09.166,00:33:10.958,There's no syncopation here.
00:33:11.041,00:33:12.791,Then where can the sink go on vacation?
00:33:12.875,00:33:14.333,You. Push-ups.
00:33:14.833,00:33:15.666,Now.
00:33:19.416,00:33:21.708,Let's take it from the glissade piqué. From the top.
00:33:22.250,00:33:23.083,Today.
00:33:25.833,00:33:29.083,"One, two, three, four, five, six, over!"
00:33:32.708,00:33:36.041,Eyeballs. Do I have to duct tape those to your face?
00:33:36.875,00:33:37.750,Fingers.
00:33:38.208,00:33:39.958,I thought you could feel the beat.
00:33:40.500,00:33:42.000,So why are you always behind?
00:33:44.958,00:33:45.791,And...
00:33:45.875,00:33:46.875,-Pigtails. -Okay.
00:33:47.583,00:33:49.833,You literally have no idea what you're doing.
00:33:50.625,00:33:52.416,Don't waste my time and go learn the steps.
00:33:52.875,00:33:53.708,Go!
00:33:54.458,00:33:57.375,"The rest of you, up on your highest demi-pointe. Close your ribs. Again."
00:34:01.375,00:34:02.666,Okay. Everybody ready?
00:34:03.291,00:34:04.125,Ready?
00:34:04.375,00:34:07.208,"One, two, three, four, five, six, over!"
00:34:07.291,00:34:08.666,-And up! -Stop!
00:34:08.750,00:34:10.458,"Oh, okay. Stop."
00:34:11.000,00:34:12.125,Is everyone ready?
00:34:12.583,00:34:13.416,We're ready.
00:34:13.875,00:34:14.875,In positions.
00:34:15.333,00:34:18.458,That's two straight lines.
00:34:18.541,00:34:20.458,Okay. Everybody hustle. Ready?
00:34:20.541,00:34:23.416,"One, two, three, four, five, six, over!"
00:34:23.541,00:34:24.500,And up!
00:34:24.625,00:34:26.416,-On your leg. -Over. And up!
00:34:32.333,00:34:33.458,Then do it!
00:34:34.041,00:34:35.208,What is the problem?
00:34:35.291,00:34:38.166,Maybe it's that we have no idea what you're yelling.
00:34:38.250,00:34:40.083,"If we weren't on our legs, we'd be on our butts!"
00:34:40.166,00:34:41.291,Okay. Okay.
00:34:41.833,00:34:45.833,All right. Why don't you just -take a moment to explain-- -Yeah.
00:34:46.000,00:34:50.666,"How about you try teaching? Instead of leaving us clueless, standing here with our wieners swinging in the breeze."
00:34:52.541,00:34:53.958,You think you can do better?
00:34:54.833,00:34:57.416,"Well, you're such a crappy teacher, I certainly can't do worse."
00:34:59.458,00:35:00.708,Get out of my class.
00:35:03.666,00:35:04.500,Make me.
00:35:05.583,00:35:06.458,Get out...
00:35:07.541,00:35:08.458,of my...
00:35:09.208,00:35:10.041,class.
00:35:10.125,00:35:12.666,You get out of my face!
00:35:15.416,00:35:16.333,I'm done.
00:35:18.791,00:35:19.791,"Good luck, Miss Barb."
00:35:19.875,00:35:22.125,-They're hopeless. -I knew you wouldn't stick around.
00:35:28.208,00:35:29.500,You got something else to say?
00:35:38.166,00:35:39.333,Where's my crayon?
00:35:41.583,00:35:43.416,"Woman, you better be calling to apologize."
00:35:43.500,00:35:44.333,For what?
00:35:44.416,00:35:46.750,"Oh, it's you. I'm sorry. I thought you were Mar Jar."
00:35:46.833,00:35:48.416,-Who? -Marissa Jaret Winokur.
00:35:48.500,00:35:50.750,"Oh, I danced in a benefit she did for Broadway Cares."
00:35:50.833,00:35:57.750,"Well, I loaned that thief these vintage Louboutins for this Tony Award Winners Luncheon, and now she claims she gave 'em back."
00:35:57.833,00:36:02.000,"But why are you calling me? I thought you got banished to, uh... Idaho?"
00:36:02.083,00:36:03.083,Wisconsin.
00:36:03.166,00:36:10.750,"-Oh! -Long story short, this amazing opportunity presented itself to dance in front of Welly Wong. And..."
00:36:14.583,00:36:15.416,I'm quitting.
00:36:20.375,00:36:21.875,Am I really that bad?
00:36:23.666,00:36:25.041,Uh...
00:36:27.166,00:36:28.000,Yeah.
00:36:29.000,00:36:29.833,Oh.
00:36:32.041,00:36:34.166,I just wanna be good at something.
00:36:45.333,00:36:46.208,You still there?
00:36:46.291,00:36:50.958,Your maternal instincts are beyond aspirational.
00:36:56.291,00:37:02.375,Being on your leg is kind of like the difference between a banana and a carrot.
00:37:02.791,00:37:08.250,See? Crooked things can't balance. Aw.
00:37:08.333,00:37:09.166,But...
00:37:10.416,00:37:12.208,straight things...
00:37:14.708,00:37:16.708,Wait. Why didn't she just say that?
00:37:16.791,00:37:18.083,"Oh, you know."
00:37:18.666,00:37:20.041,Miss April's kinda funny.
00:37:20.791,00:37:32.333,"You know, she always wants to be perfect, and, you know, she was about your age when she decided that she needed to become an amazing dancer."
00:37:32.416,00:37:37.250,"So, she started pushing herself harder, harder, and..."
00:37:37.708,00:37:43.583,she forgets that other people aren't as perfect as she is.
00:37:43.666,00:37:44.958,"So, we..."
00:37:46.208,00:37:48.583,gotta be real patient with her.
00:37:49.583,00:37:50.958,-Okay? -Okay.
00:37:51.041,00:37:52.250,Can I tell you a secret?
00:37:56.958,00:37:57.833,Mm-hmm.
00:37:58.291,00:38:00.500,What about you? Are you a banana or a carrot?
00:38:02.583,00:38:04.083,I'm so proud of you. Good job.
00:39:17.250,00:39:19.041,If you connect to your center and...
00:39:19.500,00:39:22.041,"you really hold your core, you'll have more control over your body."
00:39:23.125,00:39:24.208,"Super, thanks."
00:39:25.625,00:39:28.625,And if there's ever anything that you wanna talk about that you...
00:39:29.583,00:39:31.625,maybe can't talk to Nick or your grandma about it.
00:39:31.708,00:39:34.083,"-I've been there, done that, so-- -All set. Can I go now?"
00:39:36.166,00:39:38.166,"Look, Sarah, I'm just trying to meet you halfway."
00:39:39.125,00:39:41.750,"We’re not in class, so I don’t have to listen to anything you say."
00:39:43.458,00:39:44.750,What is your problem?
00:39:45.708,00:39:47.708,What happened to you? You weren't like this before.
00:39:47.791,00:39:48.625,Before what?
00:39:49.041,00:39:50.583,Before you left or before my mom died?
00:39:51.416,00:39:52.875,"No, don't use that as a crutch."
00:39:53.333,00:39:55.375,-I had to grow up without a mom too. -Did she die?
00:39:55.458,00:39:56.375,No.
00:39:56.500,00:39:58.208,No. My mom left me by choice.
00:39:58.833,00:40:00.208,You wanna unpack that one?
00:40:00.291,00:40:01.958,"Well, like mother, like daughter, I guess."
00:40:03.750,00:40:04.583,Excuse me?
00:40:05.375,00:40:07.166,You left without even saying goodbye.
00:40:07.625,00:40:10.125,"Sarah, people live their own lives."
00:40:11.125,00:40:12.250,Get used to it.
00:40:13.375,00:40:15.625,"Besides, it's not like I was dating you."
00:40:16.291,00:40:18.708,Right. Then I’d at least have gotten a text message.
00:40:18.791,00:40:20.791,But who cares about the dumb little sister anyway?
00:40:29.291,00:40:32.125,There's got to have been a thousand people that auditioned before me.
00:40:32.208,00:40:36.791,"I've been waiting to audition for the new Welly Wong show Whirly Girl, and I'm almost at the front."
00:40:37.041,00:40:39.083,I hope I get a callback.
00:40:58.291,00:41:00.958,-What are you doing down there? -Looking for my phone.
00:41:01.458,00:41:02.500,It's in your hand.
00:41:04.708,00:41:08.000,"Yes, that's 'cause I already found it. Obviously."
00:41:14.041,00:41:15.500,"Oh, you know, not much."
00:41:15.666,00:41:18.583,I was just working down the street when I saw Grandma drive by in my truck.
00:41:18.875,00:41:19.708,"Hey, Grams!"
00:41:22.625,00:41:26.708,"Technically, she's not allowed to drive anymore but she loves this merry-go-round."
00:41:28.333,00:41:29.166,So...
00:41:29.583,00:41:32.250,Sarah told me you guys had a fun class last night.
00:41:32.875,00:41:35.833,"Oh, yeah. It was a barrel of laughs."
00:41:36.166,00:41:38.833,"I mean, I’m trying to help her, but it’s like a brick wall."
00:41:38.916,00:41:40.125,That doesn't sound right.
00:41:41.250,00:41:43.291,"-Really? -Yeah, you trying to help someone?"
00:41:43.791,00:41:46.125,Ha ha. Very funny.
00:41:47.958,00:41:51.208,"Hey, look, she's not gonna put out the welcome mat just 'cause you're back."
00:41:52.416,00:41:54.458,"You know, you're the reason she started dancing."
00:41:54.541,00:41:56.208,You were her lifeline and then...
00:41:56.625,00:41:57.750,poof.
00:41:58.458,00:42:04.041,"You know, if you really wanna help her, try remembering what it was like when you were in her shoes."
00:42:05.541,00:42:08.791,"You know, when you were all moody and wearing flannel."
00:42:09.958,00:42:11.708,-That never happened. -Pictures don't lie.
00:42:11.791,00:42:13.916,"No, I have no recollection."
00:42:25.458,00:42:27.166,Rehearsals can get intense.
00:42:28.041,00:42:29.166,It's part of the job.
00:42:34.875,00:42:35.958,Moving on.
00:42:37.208,00:42:39.958,"Dude, you walked out after one class."
00:42:40.041,00:42:41.041,We're just kids.
00:42:41.666,00:42:43.833,We don't learn as fast as you professionals.
00:42:43.916,00:42:45.416,And what about rule number two?
00:42:46.083,00:42:47.000,Commitment?
00:42:48.958,00:42:50.916,If you promise to do what I tell you.
00:42:51.333,00:42:54.958,"and curtail the attitude, I promise to honor my commitment..."
00:42:55.875,00:42:57.708,and see it through to the end.
00:42:59.875,00:43:00.833,Deal?
00:43:07.458,00:43:09.625,"Well, what do you guys want to do?"
00:43:09.916,00:43:10.750,I mean...
00:43:11.583,00:43:13.083,I want to keep competing.
00:43:13.541,00:43:14.625,-Me too. -Me too.
00:43:18.458,00:43:19.458,-Me too. -Me too.
00:43:19.666,00:43:20.750,"Well, yeah..."
00:43:21.625,00:43:23.750,but she's the only one good enough to get us there.
00:43:31.916,00:43:33.291,"So, do we have a deal?"
00:43:35.250,00:43:36.083,Deal.
00:43:37.833,00:43:38.666,Okay.
00:43:40.250,00:43:43.625,"Let's start with the barre, because we've got a lot to do in two weeks."
00:43:44.875,00:43:46.208,First position.
00:43:46.750,00:43:48.250,Fifth position.
00:43:49.083,00:43:51.625,There it is. That’s a nice port de bras. See that?
00:43:53.708,00:43:54.708,Twenty.
00:43:57.708,00:43:59.041,Fourth position.
00:44:01.833,00:44:02.750,Again.
00:44:02.833,00:44:05.083,Step battement. Battement.
00:44:05.291,00:44:08.791,Side. Back. Step battement. Front.
00:44:13.666,00:44:15.166,"-Zuzu, I love you. -Coach!"
00:44:15.250,00:44:16.916,-This is not free daycare. -All right.
00:44:19.625,00:44:21.041,Fifth position.
00:44:21.208,00:44:22.125,Fifth position.
00:44:25.791,00:44:26.625,What is this?
00:44:27.375,00:44:28.333,What is this?
00:44:28.625,00:44:33.625,Noodle arms. You might as well just wave goodbye to Nationals. Wave goodbye. Bye.
00:44:33.708,00:44:36.791,"Turn, turn, turn."
00:44:37.958,00:44:40.583,You have to spot. That's why you're dizzy.
00:44:40.708,00:44:41.541,Again.
00:44:43.416,00:44:44.375,Prepare.
00:44:45.625,00:44:46.583,Pirouette.
00:44:47.041,00:44:48.625,And turn.
00:44:48.958,00:44:52.708,"Turn, turn, turn, turn."
00:44:53.375,00:44:54.666,Fingers. Sarah.
00:44:54.750,00:44:57.125,That's exactly why you're in the back.
00:44:57.625,00:45:01.000,How many times do I have to say this? You have to practice at home.
00:45:02.125,00:45:04.000,Again. Prepare.
00:45:06.208,00:45:08.208,"No, sweetheart. Okay, it's close."
00:45:08.291,00:45:13.250,"It's three, four, head roll, contract, pas de bourrée."
00:45:13.333,00:45:17.375,"Five, six, ready to turn, one! Step two, and two."
00:45:19.208,00:45:20.333,And three. Hip!
00:45:26.250,00:45:28.208,"Contract, pas de bourrée."
00:45:29.208,00:45:30.833,You good? Beautiful.
00:45:40.916,00:45:42.500,What are you doing in the dark?
00:45:43.958,00:45:45.666,Nothing. Just homework.
00:45:45.750,00:45:46.958,Put on a light.
00:45:47.041,00:45:48.083,And get to bed soon.
00:45:57.125,00:45:59.125,Spotting will keep you from getting dizzy.
00:46:03.208,00:46:04.375,Spot the faces.
00:46:07.333,00:46:08.166,Take it away.
00:46:08.250,00:46:09.083,Red face.
00:46:10.083,00:46:11.166,Red face.
00:46:12.083,00:46:12.916,Red face.
00:46:13.541,00:46:14.458,Red face.
00:46:18.541,00:46:19.375,Again.
00:46:20.541,00:46:21.750,Green face.
00:46:22.416,00:46:23.250,Green face.
00:46:24.166,00:46:25.041,Green face.
00:46:29.208,00:46:30.375,Blue face.
00:46:30.458,00:46:31.666,Purple face!
00:46:32.500,00:46:33.416,Green!
00:46:34.250,00:46:35.208,Blue!
00:46:35.833,00:46:36.750,Red!
00:46:38.916,00:46:41.833,"-Six, seven, eight and one. -Are we bananas, or are we carrots?"
00:46:43.916,00:46:48.125,"-seven, eight. -Shoulders, it's not just about doing the moves. You have to sell it."
00:46:50.250,00:46:51.833,"Shoulders, get to the back."
00:46:55.041,00:46:56.250,Fingers.
00:46:59.500,00:47:00.500,Go to the front.
00:47:03.916,00:47:05.083,Yes!
00:47:05.166,00:47:07.083,That's what I'm talking about. That's my girl.
00:47:10.625,00:47:11.541,"That's 20, Coach."
00:47:13.000,00:47:15.375,"-Sorry, Miss April, I'll do right here. -Make it 40."
00:47:17.833,00:47:18.750,Two.
00:47:22.291,00:47:25.083,"And there's five, six, seven, eight."
00:47:25.166,00:47:27.000,"Hands on hips, here we go."
00:47:27.083,00:47:35.541,"And one, two, three, four, five and six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, up, down!"
00:47:38.000,00:47:39.125,That...
00:47:50.958,00:47:52.208,Whoo!
00:47:52.583,00:47:53.541,Yeah!
00:47:56.250,00:47:58.916,"-They don't suck. -All right, back to one!"
00:48:02.666,00:48:04.083,You still suck a little.
00:48:12.500,00:48:14.750,"Okay, so, uh..."
00:48:15.250,00:48:17.916,"I mean, we can't dance in this..."
00:48:18.958,00:48:20.458,"Now, what do we do?"
00:48:23.708,00:48:24.708,Obviously.
00:48:27.833,00:50:53.000,"-Wait, where are you going? -Where's everybody-- Hi, uh..."
00:50:53.708,00:50:55.083,"No, no, I didn't mean to..."
00:50:56.458,00:50:57.291,It's okay.
00:50:57.375,00:50:59.958,I just need to see what I have to pick up at the hardware store.
00:51:00.041,00:51:02.000,"I just had some time, thought I'd fix up the barn."
00:51:02.083,00:51:03.083,Get your dad off my back.
00:51:03.166,00:51:05.708,"Who'd have thought back in high school, you’d end up being so..."
00:51:06.166,00:51:07.000,handy.
00:51:09.166,00:51:11.791,"You know, not that any of this is how I pictured my life would be."
00:51:13.625,00:51:14.875,Welcome to the club.
00:51:15.333,00:51:18.000,"Oh, please. You were dancing on Broadway."
00:51:18.208,00:51:20.791,I’d say your life turned out exactly how you thought it would.
00:51:23.708,00:51:25.500,"You know, Nick... um..."
00:51:28.875,00:51:33.166,"Even if your life isn't entirely what you pictured, I do really admire what you did."
00:51:33.250,00:51:37.458,"Dropping your life -to take care of your sister-- -I didn't, you know, drop my life."
00:51:38.375,00:51:41.583,"You know, you do what you have to. What you think is right."
00:51:43.833,00:51:45.125,That's just what you do.
00:51:45.416,00:51:49.708,"-I just mean that I-- -No, I know. It's not-- It's not exactly the..."
00:51:50.333,00:51:51.875,big plan we came up with.
00:51:51.958,00:51:53.875,Running away to New York together.
00:51:56.291,00:51:57.125,No.
00:51:58.500,00:51:59.541,It's not.
00:52:00.083,00:52:01.375,"You now, Ape, uh..."
00:52:02.125,00:52:04.750,"after, The Text..."
00:52:07.875,00:52:09.125,I went to New York...
00:52:09.458,00:52:11.875,and then I saw you.
00:52:12.000,00:52:12.833,What?
00:52:12.916,00:52:15.500,You were coming out of your rehearsal on 46th Street.
00:52:16.000,00:52:17.708,And you had never looked happier.
00:52:18.708,00:52:20.166,And then I knew.
00:52:22.583,00:52:23.583,I had to let you go.
00:52:39.166,00:52:42.791,"You know, we-- We wouldn't have worked out for a million reasons."
00:52:43.125,00:52:44.625,Yeah. No.
00:52:47.083,00:52:48.041,But...
00:52:49.208,00:52:50.875,I bet it would have been fun to try.
00:52:56.791,00:52:59.041,"Well, I should probably get to it."
00:52:59.125,00:53:00.708,"Yeah. No, me too."
00:53:12.541,00:53:14.583,"Okay gentlemen, really drive those legs, okay?"
00:53:16.541,00:53:20.541,Coach Buzz has agreed to share his field 'cause we can't afford to fix the studio.
00:53:20.625,00:53:24.125,But that doesn't change the fact that Counties are this weekend.
00:53:24.750,00:53:25.583,So...
00:53:34.416,00:53:35.500,"Push-ups, now."
00:53:35.583,00:53:37.375,"Yes, Miss April."
00:53:40.250,00:53:42.875,You actually called them by their names.
00:53:43.541,00:53:44.791,And it was right.
00:53:44.875,00:53:47.458,"So, I learned a name or two."
00:53:47.666,00:53:49.416,"Zuzu, drop."
00:53:56.583,00:53:57.458,"You too, Kari."
00:53:58.333,00:53:59.750,But she made me interpret.
00:53:59.833,00:54:01.625,"Oh, that's 40."
00:54:07.208,00:54:09.750,Let's get 'em onto the tires. Let's go! Come on. Helmets off.
00:54:09.833,00:54:12.333,"Let's go, dipsticks! Come on, I don't have all day."
00:54:19.916,00:54:22.083,What? You think you can do better?
00:54:35.208,00:54:37.250,"Well, they don't have pads on, so..."
00:54:38.166,00:54:39.000,Okay.
00:54:39.416,00:54:40.666,Temps levé!
00:54:55.291,00:54:56.375,You were saying?
00:54:58.291,00:54:59.125,"Bye, Mom."
00:54:59.583,00:55:01.583,"Wait, where are you off to so early?"
00:55:02.000,00:55:02.916,I told you.
00:55:03.208,00:55:06.083,Oona and I are studying for our big geometry test all day.
00:55:06.375,00:55:07.541,Right. I forgot.
00:55:07.666,00:55:11.208,"Well, I've got my shift tonight -at Royalton Steakhouse-- -I know. I got my key."
00:55:11.291,00:55:12.458,"-Bye, Mom. -Love you!"
00:55:31.375,00:55:33.250,"-It's Ruby! -Honey, what are you doing here?"
00:55:33.958,00:55:35.125,Can I come along?
00:55:35.500,00:55:37.833,"Not to dance, just to watch."
00:55:38.583,00:55:39.958,My mom said it was okay.
00:55:40.041,00:55:42.416,"Oh, Lord, we would love to have you back."
00:55:42.500,00:55:45.083,You ready? I need so much help. You gonna help me?
00:55:47.708,00:55:49.291,"-Hi, Ruby. -Hi, Sarah."
00:55:55.875,00:55:57.500,It's a full house. Let's go.
00:56:03.541,00:56:04.541,"Hi, Patty."
00:56:06.125,00:56:07.208,You forgot something.
00:56:07.916,00:56:09.458,"Studying all day with Oona, huh?"
00:56:12.625,00:56:15.375,"-Mom, I-- -Off the bus. Right now, young lady."
00:56:15.916,00:56:18.625,"Oh, I'm sorry, that's just not possible."
00:56:18.958,00:56:20.875,Look. I don't want any trouble.
00:56:21.083,00:56:22.416,I'm just getting my daughter.
00:56:23.375,00:56:24.708,"Kari, get your things."
00:56:24.791,00:56:27.125,"-Patty, please. -No, Barb."
00:56:27.208,00:56:30.166,I don't appreciate you going behind my back.
00:56:30.250,00:56:33.458,"I'm sorry, but I-- I thought you knew."
00:56:33.541,00:56:34.416,I didn't.
00:56:36.083,00:56:37.041,"Come on, Kari."
00:56:38.875,00:56:40.166,"Kari, honey."
00:56:40.958,00:56:42.333,You gotta go with your mom.
00:56:43.875,00:56:45.625,Let's go! Now!
00:56:47.291,00:56:48.166,"No, Mom."
00:56:49.625,00:56:51.125,I'm not going.
00:56:51.666,00:56:53.416,We discussed this.
00:56:54.375,00:56:59.416,"I'm doing the best I can while Daddy's deployed, but we can't afford dance right now."
00:56:59.958,00:57:01.541,And we don't take charity.
00:57:03.250,00:57:05.458,Now come on. I'm gonna be late for work.
00:57:05.541,00:57:06.833,It's not charity.
00:57:08.083,00:57:09.458,I figured it out.
00:57:10.416,00:57:13.166,I made the deal with Miss Barb to work at the studio.
00:57:15.791,00:57:17.416,I earned the classes.
00:57:17.500,00:57:20.000,And I earned a spot in this competition.
00:57:21.000,00:57:22.291,"So, I'm staying."
00:57:30.208,00:57:31.291,Fine.
00:57:32.708,00:57:35.500,But we are going to talk about this at home.
00:57:47.625,00:57:48.458,Hey.
00:57:49.958,00:57:50.875,That took guts.
00:57:53.291,00:57:54.166,"Now, uh..."
00:57:57.166,00:57:58.750,Just don't puke them up on me.
00:58:01.583,00:58:02.500,You guys ready?
00:58:04.791,00:58:05.833,"Take it away, Gordy."
00:58:26.000,00:58:29.250,"Look at you. Fixing barns, fixing hair..."
00:58:30.708,00:58:32.708,"-Nick! Ah, smoke. Fire. -Ah!"
00:58:33.416,00:58:34.750,Shush.
00:58:36.333,00:58:38.916,"-What smells funny? -Nothing. Go back to sleep, Michelle."
00:58:39.000,00:58:40.125,Okay.
00:58:40.541,00:58:45.833,"Our category is on deck. Time to wake up, sleepyheads."
00:58:46.583,00:58:48.541,"Here we go. Yummy, yummy time."
00:58:48.625,00:58:50.500,"-Drink for mommy. -Barb, what's that?"
00:58:50.583,00:58:53.166,Iced mocha with an extra shot of espresso.
00:58:53.250,00:58:54.666,An extra shot of espresso.
00:58:54.750,00:58:55.583,Yeah.
00:58:59.708,00:59:01.041,It'll bring 'em right down.
00:59:01.166,00:59:03.083,"They're for adults, but I just break 'em in half."
00:59:07.250,00:59:10.250,"New Hope Dance Studio, Group Jazz."
00:59:30.375,00:59:32.416,Dance. Dance!

00:59:59.958,01:00:02.708,Dicky! That's my boy!
01:00:05.000,01:00:06.000,Dicky!

01:01:17.000,01:01:18.833,And... how's this?
01:01:21.250,01:01:23.125,I heard you guys need some professional help.
01:01:24.541,01:01:26.875,Us working girls gotta stick together.
01:01:37.583,01:01:40.250,"-Oh, perfect. -Let's go."

01:01:49.208,01:01:51.958,Our boys have been kicking your butts on the field for the last decade.
01:01:52.041,01:01:54.083,Now our girls are kicking it on stage.
01:01:57.375,01:02:02.583,Your girls wouldn't know a triple time step if our girls were dancing it -on their sad little faces. -What did you say?
01:02:03.583,01:02:04.708,"-Oh, yeah? -Yeah."
01:02:04.791,01:02:07.958,"Well, your daughter’s grand battements don’t even reach 90 degrees."
01:02:08.041,01:02:12.250,-Your daughter has no turn out. -Your daughter has got no stage presence.
01:02:12.750,01:02:14.125,You take that back!

01:02:36.208,01:02:38.791,What a loser. So embarrassing.
01:02:39.083,01:02:40.500,"Ah, here they are."
01:02:57.916,01:03:01.416,Guess your big-time Broadway teacher isn't so big-time.
01:03:03.916,01:03:05.458,"Just keep moving, guys. Come on."
01:03:09.666,01:03:13.166,"Oh, the '70s called. They want their dance skirts back."

01:04:39.541,01:04:43.458,"They danced their hearts out, and left it all on the stage."
01:04:43.541,01:04:45.708,Their rankings are unanimous with our judges.
01:04:45.791,01:04:47.458,They take into account both...
01:04:47.583,01:04:49.291,There's no way we're gonna make the cut.
01:04:50.375,01:04:51.916,We just need to come in third.
01:04:52.291,01:04:53.500,We can totally do that.
01:04:53.583,01:04:57.333,Yeah. Oona made the fall look like it was part of the dance.
01:04:58.500,01:04:59.333,Hey.

01:07:11.708,01:07:13.083,Getting me to fall for you.
01:07:16.625,01:07:19.208,"Uh, Ape, come on, it was a stupid joke."
01:07:19.375,01:07:20.833,"You know, 'cause we fell."
01:07:20.916,01:07:22.041,Yeah. I know. I get it.

01:07:43.250,01:07:45.416,Plus food and hotel. That's a fortune!
01:07:45.500,01:07:47.208,How are we gonna fundraise all that money?
01:07:47.291,01:07:50.250,"That's a lot of raffles, bake sales and car washes!"
01:07:52.125,01:07:55.625,Do you have any idea -how high the bar is at Nationals? -So high.
01:08:24.958,01:08:28.333,Did somebody call for an over-the-top work of art?
01:08:32.375,01:08:33.875,"Howdy, fellas."
01:08:38.333,01:08:39.208,Okay.
01:08:39.291,01:08:44.291,"So, we need more some bling. Does anybody own a BeDazzler?"
01:08:45.875,01:08:48.291,"Ooh, I'll take all of them."
01:08:48.500,01:08:52.333,Because these old prom dresses need a lot of bedazzling.
01:08:52.458,01:08:54.583,"-Uh, where do you guys want these? -Hi!"
01:08:54.833,01:08:57.166,"Oh, you know what? Put that in that pile over there."

01:09:35.125,01:09:37.208,"Oh, my gosh, honey. Yeah."
01:09:39.708,01:09:40.958,I remember that now.
01:09:48.083,01:09:50.916,"-Hey, Miss Barb, can I ask you a question? -Of course."
01:09:51.708,01:09:52.875,Are you happy?
01:09:56.541,01:09:58.000,I love my life.
01:09:58.083,01:10:00.166,I chose this life.
01:10:00.583,01:10:07.000,"I love teaching, and I love owning my own business, and..."
01:10:07.750,01:10:08.791,I love...
01:10:09.416,01:10:14.958,"living in a town where, if I'm feeling a little under the weather, the next thing I know, there's a casserole on my porch."
01:10:16.291,01:10:18.083,"Well, you did way more than just..."
01:10:18.958,01:10:21.375,make a few casseroles for us after my mom left.
01:10:22.375,01:10:28.083,"Oh, well, it-- I just don't think I ever told you what a difference that all made."
01:10:31.375,01:10:32.375,"Well, you..."
01:10:33.458,01:10:36.125,are making a difference for these kids.
01:10:36.916,01:10:38.708,Whether you know it or not.
01:10:43.250,01:10:45.083,"Hey, Miss Barb. Can I ask you one more question?"
01:10:45.166,01:10:46.083,Mm-hmm.
01:10:48.875,01:10:50.250,What is going on with this perm?
01:10:52.625,01:10:56.708,"Oh, that is a lot of damage to the ozone right there."
01:11:00.750,01:11:02.625,"-Thanks. -Get well, Frank."
01:11:05.458,01:11:32.708,"...46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, Okay, everybody."
01:11:34.791,01:11:36.958,"First off, welcome to our new home."
01:11:37.125,01:11:39.208,Second... we did it.
01:11:40.041,01:11:46.291,"We're gonna be eating PB&amp;J for a really long time, but we raised the money!"
01:11:49.750,01:11:51.125,Go Churners!
01:11:51.250,01:11:52.333,Churners!
01:11:56.583,01:11:59.583,"Okay, okay, okay."
01:12:00.166,01:12:03.583,"We're not there yet, and we still have a lot of work to do."
01:12:03.666,01:12:09.458,"So tonight, after Open Technique class, we'll be running all of the dances, top-to-bottom."
01:12:09.541,01:12:11.166,Got it? Cool.
01:12:11.625,01:12:18.291,"But before we do that, we need to make sure that we nail the Star Lift. So, little dancers, front and center."
01:12:22.041,01:12:24.333,Hold. There it is. Use those muscles.
01:12:26.583,01:12:28.791,Let's try that again. Count of three.
01:12:28.875,01:12:30.833,"One, two, three!"
01:12:30.916,01:12:32.541,And Star Lift!
01:12:33.041,01:12:36.291,There it is. Perfect. Oh!
01:12:36.875,01:12:38.500,Shake it off. And...
01:12:38.583,01:12:41.250,"There-- Oh, no. Okay, lift."
01:12:41.500,01:12:47.041,"Now, get under-- Yeah."
01:12:49.958,01:12:50.916,Let's...
01:12:51.500,01:12:54.208,"try it with one of the bigger kids, so you guys can see how it's done."
01:12:54.291,01:12:56.125,"We have football players here, so..."
01:12:56.583,01:12:57.916,I need Sarah...
01:12:58.958,01:13:06.625,and... RJ Yeah. Come on. Put those muscles to work.
01:13:09.708,01:13:11.875,"-Go, Sarah, go. -This is your chance."
01:13:31.250,01:13:32.791,"Okay, you know what to do?"
01:13:33.916,01:13:34.916,When you're ready.
01:13:43.125,01:13:45.500,RJ lock out your elbows. There it is. Don't lose it. Ooh!
01:13:45.625,01:13:47.125,There it is. Perfect.
01:13:47.208,01:13:49.541,"Okay. Sarah, hold your core."
01:13:50.166,01:13:52.500,Don't lose it. Gently dip her down into a fish.
01:13:52.583,01:13:56.333,"Gently. Squeeze your core, squeeze your-- Don't lose it. Don't lose it."
01:13:56.416,01:14:08.125,Don't lose it. Don't-- -That fall out of your sandwich? -Hey!
01:14:11.875,01:14:13.125,Could you stop?
01:14:13.541,01:14:15.416,Sarah! Sarah!
01:14:15.500,01:14:16.666,"Sarah, wait up!"
01:14:17.208,01:14:18.208,Sarah!
01:14:20.500,01:14:21.583,Sarah!
01:14:32.833,01:14:33.791,Sarah!
01:14:38.500,01:14:39.541,Sarah!
01:15:15.125,01:15:16.125,Come here.
01:16:19.541,01:16:27.541,"Go to the ballroom, check the floor, make sure-- Don't forget we have to check out the Royalton-- -Hey. -Oh, my God. I'm so sorry-- No. Hey, as in, I know you, right?"
01:16:33.125,01:16:34.250,I know how I know you.
01:16:34.333,01:16:35.541,"April, right?"
01:16:35.625,01:16:37.791,You danced in one of my Broadway Cares benefits.
01:16:37.875,01:16:40.000,You're an amazing dancer. You've got great technique.
01:16:42.250,01:16:43.500,You!
01:16:43.625,01:16:48.500,"Well, if it isn't the shrill, little shoe thief."
01:16:52.583,01:16:54.541,Where are my heels?
01:16:54.625,01:16:57.541,"Oh, I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about."
01:16:57.625,01:16:58.625,Aw...
01:16:58.750,01:17:01.875,"Big Brother, you're not that good an actress."
01:17:01.958,01:17:11.375,"I'll have you know, I won a Tony Award for Best Actress My God. I'm sorry, what? Give it a rest, honey."
01:17:11.458,01:17:17.083,"Ugh,You Can't Stop The Beat-ing us all over the head with that dusty newsflash."
01:17:18.916,01:17:20.708,How's that for beating you over the head?
01:17:20.791,01:17:24.375,Ooh! I'm gonna keep this as collateral.
01:17:24.458,01:17:26.250,"-Okay. I think we gotta go. -Oh, do we?"
01:17:26.333,01:17:27.791,-Yeah. -I was just getting warmed up.
01:17:27.875,01:17:30.250,That's fine. That shoe belongs to RuPaul anyway!
01:17:30.333,01:17:32.958,Oh! You stole from RuPaul too?
01:17:38.666,01:17:40.583,Royalton Dance Conservatory.
01:18:55.000,01:18:55.833,Ow!
01:19:00.500,01:19:03.541,"Oh, my goodness. Honey..."
01:19:04.208,01:19:08.000,Miss April told you two not to practice the Star Lift too much.
01:19:08.541,01:19:10.208,"Dicky, bud."
01:19:10.708,01:19:11.958,Why didn't you tell me?
01:19:12.041,01:19:13.250,He was hiding it.
01:19:13.875,01:19:16.166,I was afraid you wouldn't let me dance.
01:19:20.666,01:19:21.625,I can do it.
01:19:21.708,01:19:24.750,I just have to think of something else they can do instead of the Star Lift.
01:19:27.041,01:19:29.208,"All right. Well, everybody take your places. Let's go."
01:19:29.291,01:19:32.250,"Wait! No, strike a pose instead of the lift, okay?"
01:19:32.666,01:19:34.833,Strike a pose instead of the lift!
01:19:37.666,01:19:39.125,They're gonna be great.
01:19:58.666,01:19:59.958,It's going well. It's going well.
01:20:11.500,01:20:12.333,No.
01:20:19.625,01:20:20.791,Don't!
01:20:35.875,01:20:37.125,"Oh, my God!"
01:20:47.166,01:20:49.541,"led by their teacher, April Dibrina."
01:20:49.625,01:20:52.541,Let's see if they can impress Broadway's Welly Wong.
01:20:57.250,01:20:58.083,Hey.
01:20:58.958,01:21:03.333,"We are almost up. The girls are waiting, and Miss Barb looks like she's about to pass a kidney stone."
01:21:08.333,01:21:09.625,Hey. You okay?
01:21:12.583,01:21:13.833,What if I blow it?
01:21:19.500,01:21:20.458,You're serious?
01:21:20.916,01:21:24.583,"Wait. All those times in front of paying audiences, and you're nervous about this?"
01:21:26.875,01:21:28.750,"Nick, I was just in the chorus."
01:21:28.833,01:21:30.500,No one was ever looking at me.
01:21:30.583,01:21:33.333,"And now, everyone is counting on me."
01:21:33.666,01:21:38.625,"The girls, my dad, the town, and I can't let everyone down."
01:21:39.041,01:21:41.791,"Hey, how could you possibly let anyone down?"
01:21:42.708,01:21:43.583,April.
01:21:43.666,01:21:46.291,What you've done for everyone? It's amazing.
01:21:48.791,01:21:55.375,You know when you told me that you came to New York after I sent you The Text?
01:21:55.458,01:21:56.333,Yeah.
01:21:56.791,01:21:58.958,I really wish I'd seen you that day.
01:23:18.875,01:23:21.291,We are family.
01:24:09.875,01:24:12.000,We are family.
01:24:59.041,01:25:01.166,-Just like I taught you. -Just like you taught me.
01:25:01.250,01:25:02.916,You two slayed it!
01:25:04.416,01:25:05.625,"Oh, yeah, you did!"
01:25:06.250,01:25:09.625,April! I have to run back to take care of an emergency but...
01:25:10.083,01:25:13.250,can I steal you away for a moment? I have a proposition for you.
01:25:14.291,01:25:16.125,"Yes, of course. Um..."
01:25:17.250,01:25:18.833,I will catch up with you guys.
01:25:21.958,01:25:23.041,everybody. Come on.
01:25:24.708,01:25:27.416,"This couldn't have worked out more perfectly, right?"
01:25:27.500,01:25:29.541,April? Hey.
01:25:30.250,01:25:33.166,"I was just coming to find you, um-- Where are you going?"
01:25:34.250,01:25:35.250,"I'm, uh..."
01:25:36.166,01:25:37.291,I'm headed back to New York.
01:25:38.125,01:25:39.000,What?
01:25:39.083,01:25:41.583,Welly Wong offered me a part in his new show.
01:25:42.750,01:25:43.875,The lead.
01:25:44.708,01:25:47.416,And I have to be at rehearsals now.
01:25:47.500,01:25:49.333,Welly's been called back.
01:25:49.750,01:25:51.708,"Oh, what about finals?"
01:25:52.250,01:25:53.166,They're tomorrow.
01:25:53.583,01:25:55.166,I'll tell him you'll be right out.
01:25:59.541,01:26:01.000,"So, you're just ditching us?"
01:26:01.750,01:26:04.000,But this whole thing was your idea. You made a commitment.
01:26:04.083,01:26:06.583,I know. But what am I supposed to do?
01:26:07.791,01:26:09.958,"Sarah, I've dreamt of this my whole life."
01:26:12.000,01:26:13.125,"So, I'm going."
01:26:17.416,01:26:20.916,You just wanted to use the stupid little girls so you could claw your way back to Broadway.
01:26:24.375,01:26:27.000,I knew it. I knew it the whole time. You're just a selfish jerk!
01:26:29.416,01:26:30.916,You're just leaving me again!
01:26:35.541,01:26:36.666,Good luck tomorrow.
01:26:43.875,01:26:44.833,April...
01:26:46.333,01:26:48.125,"April, wait! April!"
01:26:48.208,01:26:49.333,Wait! Wait!
01:26:51.208,01:26:52.208,Please.
01:26:52.833,01:26:54.041,Please don't go.
01:26:55.666,01:26:57.041,-Please. -You don't need me.
01:26:57.416,01:26:58.583,You're gonna be great.
01:27:01.875,01:27:08.000,"-I'm sorry. -No, please, don't-- April!"
01:27:32.416,01:27:35.125,"Yes! Do you want me to-- Oh, this? Okay. Ready? One, two, three!"
01:27:36.250,01:27:38.041,"-Yay, Piggy! -Hey!"
01:27:41.708,01:27:42.541,Sarah?
01:28:05.375,01:28:09.083,"Everybody. Everybody, attention, please. Andrew, Michael, ladies."
01:28:09.625,01:28:10.541,Guess who this is?
01:28:10.625,01:28:13.166,"This is our Whirly Girl, April."
01:28:13.500,01:28:15.333,Let's all give her a warm welcome.
01:28:38.541,01:28:39.458,Thanks.
01:28:40.041,01:28:41.750,"You're welcome, baby girl."
01:28:45.708,01:28:46.791,Good night.
01:29:00.416,01:29:01.416,Hello?
01:29:06.791,01:29:10.791,"Well, sweetheart, you've been busting your ass at this for quite a long time."
01:29:11.250,01:29:13.083,"I mean, I finally got my dream."
01:29:15.083,01:29:16.208,It's the perfect show.
01:29:17.333,01:29:18.291,The perfect role.
01:29:20.083,01:29:23.958,"I don't know, I just-- I thought I'd be happier."
01:29:24.541,01:29:25.375,Yeah.
01:29:25.625,01:29:27.583,That's the problem with being a perfectionist.
01:29:29.125,01:29:30.500,Nothing's ever good enough.
01:29:31.458,01:29:33.083,"You know, I keep telling myself."
01:29:34.291,01:29:35.375,I'm a dancer.
01:29:36.375,01:29:38.166,This is what I'm supposed to do.
01:29:38.500,01:29:39.416,Says who?
01:29:40.750,01:29:42.625,You do what your gut tells you to do.
01:29:43.166,01:29:51.333,"And if there's any part of you that thinks that making a big splash on Broadway is suddenly gonna bring your mom back, you can forget about that."
01:29:51.416,01:29:53.500,There's nothing you can do to bring her back.
01:29:54.666,01:29:57.125,Because it wasn't your fault that she left in the first place.
01:29:57.208,01:29:58.708,She just left.
01:30:00.166,01:30:05.041,"So, whatever you decide, just make sure that it makes you feel good about who you are."
01:30:06.625,01:30:07.500,I mean...
01:30:08.166,01:30:10.000,it's what I've always wanted to be.
01:30:12.875,01:30:14.291,I'd be stupid not to.
01:30:14.375,01:30:16.833,"I didn't say what you are, I said who."
01:30:18.958,01:30:22.416,And I can think of nine little reasons why it wouldn't be so stupid.
01:30:36.083,01:30:37.333,"Hey, everybody."
01:30:37.416,01:30:39.625,We'll start scene work in five minutes.
01:30:39.708,01:30:40.833,Top of the second act.
01:31:24.625,01:31:25.666,Mr. Wong.
01:31:28.541,01:31:32.208,"Mr. Wong. I'm sorry, Mr. Wong, but I have to go back to the competition."
01:31:32.291,01:31:39.541,"If that means that you have to give my part to someone else, I understand. I mean, I don't want you to, because I think you need someone who honors their commitments."
01:31:39.625,01:31:42.166,"And you see, that's exactly why I have to go, because..."
01:31:42.958,01:31:45.291,I have nine little kids that I committed to.
01:31:47.208,01:31:49.416,"You know, I have a whole town that's counting on me."
01:31:51.083,01:31:52.125,"So, I have to go."
01:31:56.416,01:32:02.708,What the-- When do they go on?
01:32:02.791,01:32:06.500,"They're in the first group after lunch, -but I can't find them. -Okay, I'm on my way back."
01:32:06.583,01:32:09.791,-You'll never make it in time! -Get them ready. I'll be there. Promise!
01:32:10.000,01:32:13.000,"Ruby, -find them. -On it."
01:32:15.083,01:32:16.916,You couldn't have asked to borrow his limo?
01:32:17.000,01:32:18.375,Just admit it. You love me.
01:32:26.458,01:32:28.750,with day two of our competition!
01:32:28.916,01:32:30.875,"-Next up, number 44. -Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh."
01:32:32.791,01:32:34.958,The New Hope Dance Studio.
01:32:38.458,01:32:39.583,-Okay? -Okay?
01:32:49.375,01:32:51.916,"Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!"
01:32:55.833,01:32:56.750,"Oh, my God!"
01:32:56.833,01:32:58.750,-We're at our countdown. -Okay.
01:33:00.625,01:33:01.500,Okay.
01:33:01.750,01:33:03.875,"They should be-- Oh, no."
01:33:04.333,01:33:05.500,-Where are they? -I don't know.
01:33:05.583,01:33:16.208,"I don't know. I was panicking. I said to Ruby, I was like, Find them, but I wasn't-- I didn't specifically say like, Bring them stage left. I-- Hurry, we are in our final countdown."
01:33:18.958,01:33:20.541,What's she doing here?
01:33:20.625,01:33:23.125,"Yeah, I wonder who's in the audience this time?"
01:33:26.125,01:33:27.666,"Well, they probably fired her."
01:33:28.083,01:33:29.083,Again.
01:33:30.500,01:33:34.416,"Look, you have every right to hate me, but you earned this."
01:33:35.041,01:33:36.875,You deserve to be here.
01:33:36.958,01:33:40.500,"So, please don't sit out on this just because you wanna get back at me."
01:33:42.666,01:33:44.708,"When I first met you, all I saw were flaws."
01:33:45.208,01:33:48.791,"And then I realized, that's exactly what makes you spectacular."
01:33:49.791,01:33:52.625,All those beautiful quirks and imperfections.
01:33:54.583,01:33:56.833,And I'm so sorry that I left.
01:34:01.333,01:34:02.666,to realize that...
01:34:06.166,01:34:07.416,we've become family.
01:34:09.708,01:34:11.250,What's wrong with you?
01:34:11.333,01:34:12.916,How come you're not yelling at us?
01:34:14.041,01:34:17.666,I want you to know how proud I am of all of you.
01:34:18.541,01:34:21.625,You've all become the most beautiful dancers.
01:34:21.708,01:34:23.208,You're scaring me.
01:34:24.500,01:34:30.875,"...Dance Studio, last call. You have one minute to be on stage or you will be disqualified."
01:34:31.375,01:34:36.458,Disgusted. I'm disgusted by all this whimpering self-pity.
01:34:36.541,01:34:38.375,"Now, this is not how I trained you."
01:34:38.625,01:34:40.625,"So, put on your big-girl pants."
01:34:40.750,01:34:44.791,"You too, Dicky. You get on that stage, or else."
01:34:45.250,01:34:47.708,You have till the count of five. One.
01:34:48.500,01:34:50.375,"Oh, you thought I was being tough on you before."
01:34:50.458,01:34:51.916,"Oh, no, I was just getting started."
01:34:52.000,01:34:53.500,-Two! -Jackets. Okay.
01:34:53.583,01:34:55.875,Give me your jackets. Jackets!

01:35:01.458,01:35:02.625,"Come on, let's do it."
01:35:02.708,01:35:04.500,Clear for talent.
01:35:08.083,01:35:10.458,"You better kick butt, or I'll kick yours!"
01:35:19.750,01:35:20.625,Hi!

01:37:17.500,01:37:19.000,"I don't think he's out there, honey."
01:37:20.208,01:37:22.500,Gordy told me he took off when he heard you were back.
01:38:58.708,01:39:00.458,"-Hi, honey. -Barb."
01:39:01.083,01:39:02.708,You're so-- What did I tell you?
01:39:02.791,01:39:04.708,-You have to hold it away from your face. -Sorry.
01:39:04.791,01:39:10.833,"-I'm just gonna see every pore. -Okay, well-- Listen, I got some bad news. That barn's roof is leaking."
01:39:10.958,01:39:13.333,"I mean, so much worse than my studio."
01:39:13.750,01:39:16.375,"-Well, I asked Nick to repair it and-- -Whoa, hold on."
01:39:16.541,01:39:19.500,"Okay, in my defense, I said we should replace, not repair."
01:39:19.583,01:39:22.375,"Well, anyway, we canceled class. Okay, bye."
01:39:22.458,01:39:24.541,Hang on. Hang on. That's not the agreement.
01:39:24.875,01:39:27.541,I teach class over FaceTime. They do what I say.
01:39:27.875,01:39:30.208,I fly back every Sunday. They do what I say.
01:39:30.583,01:39:35.625,"-Okay. But-- -And what I say is, I don't really care if there's three feet of water and they have to swim."
01:39:36.041,01:39:36.916,Mm-hmm.
01:39:37.458,01:39:38.583,They show up to class.
01:39:41.541,01:39:45.500,"Well, I'll get them all together and call you when I have them."
01:39:48.083,01:39:48.916,Okay.
01:39:51.250,01:39:53.708,"Come in. Oh, Mr. Wong. Hi."
01:39:54.333,01:39:56.750,I have some notes. A couple tweaks.
01:39:57.541,01:39:58.666,But...
01:40:01.416,01:40:02.416,it didn't suck.
01:40:04.208,01:40:05.083,Thank you.
01:40:05.166,01:40:09.666,"Oh, before I forget, they said somebody's waiting for you in the theater."
01:40:18.083,01:40:19.750,What are you guys doing here?
01:40:23.541,01:40:25.458,"Well, you asked me to get everyone together."
01:40:36.416,01:40:38.958,Improve your listening skills. I said I'd call you next week.
01:40:39.833,01:40:41.625,"So, what are we gonna do now?"
