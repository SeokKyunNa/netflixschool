00:00:15.932,00:00:26.317,"scanning the shelf where your favorite books reside, and there… nestled between the familiar spines sits a red notebook."
00:00:27.652,00:00:30.321,Imagine you're in New York and it's Christmas.
00:00:32.240,00:00:44.085,"You're surrounded by people, by possibility… and the hope that, somewhere in the city, is that one person that's meant for you."
00:00:46.421,00:00:48.298,You just have to find them.
00:00:50.341,00:00:51.801,How do you do that?
00:00:52.635,00:00:55.680,It all depends on the kind of person you are.
00:01:11.905,00:01:14.783,"The forced cheer, frenzied crowds."
00:01:16.409,00:01:19.746,The carolers who've had so much eggnog they've forgotten the words.
00:01:22.207,00:01:26.586,"And, of course, the couples naive enough to mistake holiday spirit for being in love."
00:01:30.757,00:01:32.342,"I made that mistake once, too."
00:01:36.930,00:01:37.972,Never again.
00:01:40.058,00:01:40.892,Hey!
00:01:40.975,00:01:43.103,"-Season's greetings! -Oh, come on, tinsel?"
00:01:50.235,00:01:56.282,to represent one's feelings about being cast aside by their divorced mother so that she can spend Christmas in Hawaii.
00:01:58.201,00:01:59.702,That'd be huge in New York.
00:02:27.981,00:02:32.944,Some bookstores think they need to host a cookie-making class in order to sell you some Proust.
00:02:34.779,00:02:35.738,Not the Strand.
00:02:39.200,00:02:41.035,"Hey, this was mis-shelved."
00:02:41.119,00:02:44.706,"Gabriel García Márquez should be under G for García, not M for Márquez."
00:02:44.789,00:02:49.878,"And, also, this is biography. It's not fiction. So… Thanks."
00:02:51.212,00:02:55.717,"Hey, kid, if you ever wanna work here… I'll remember this."
00:03:16.029,00:03:37.217,"Hey, this was also in the wrong section, so… I've left some clues for you. If you want them, turn the page."
00:03:37.842,00:03:40.845,"If you don't, put the book back on the shelf."
00:03:49.437,00:03:53.066,"So, you've chosen to play. A revealing choice."
00:03:54.192,00:03:55.276,Shall we begin?
00:03:57.111,00:04:00.782,A coded message. You can decipher it with the right books.
00:04:00.865,00:04:03.117,But only if you can find them.
00:04:03.785,00:04:06.537,Your first clue requires some heavy reading.
00:04:07.080,00:04:09.374,Look for French pianism.
00:04:09.457,00:04:11.709,What the hell is French pianism?
00:04:20.635,00:04:22.595,French pianism.
00:04:23.429,00:04:25.014,I'm not telling you anything.
00:04:25.598,00:04:27.016,But this is the information desk.
00:04:27.100,00:04:29.644,"Are you not obligated to, like, give me some information?"
00:04:31.938,00:04:35.942,"Look, if this is about earlier, I… apologize."
00:04:36.025,00:04:37.860,I know you would never mis-shelve a book.
00:04:40.029,00:04:41.531,I don't understand. Did I wrong you?
00:04:41.614,00:04:45.743,"Did I buy you a James Patterson book for Christmas, or are you taking pleasure from my suffering?"
00:04:49.163,00:04:52.333,I promised her I wouldn't discuss anything related to that.
00:04:52.417,00:04:55.628,"But since you asked, there's a little pleasure."
00:04:55.712,00:04:56.796,You said her.
00:04:58.715,00:05:02.343,"You said her. She's a her, and she is testing my knowledge of the Strand."
00:05:04.387,00:05:05.722,Thank you for your help.
00:05:05.805,00:05:07.223,I didn't help you.
00:05:09.684,00:05:14.814,If this is how you want to play it… …game on.
00:05:18.234,00:05:27.118,"Pianism as in piano, but there's nothing in the music section, unless… heavy reading."
00:05:31.664,00:05:35.960,"It's a code. Page 88, seventh line, second word."
00:05:41.632,00:05:42.884,Am I what?
00:05:54.562,00:05:57.357,but Santa does show up to hand out weapons.
00:05:59.442,00:06:03.446,"Now, presuming you read this as a child, what bothered you about this scene?"
00:06:04.697,00:06:07.367,That's easy. Why is jolly St. Nick giving an eight-year-old a knife?
00:06:10.370,00:06:11.329,this can go on.
00:06:12.038,00:06:17.293,Your next clue is inside the most popular title in Sex and Sexuality.
00:06:34.936,00:06:35.770,Priya.
00:06:36.604,00:06:38.773,-Hey. -I didn't know you were in town.
00:06:40.983,00:06:48.324,"No one's in town. Everyone's off in Bora Bora… back when I dated her best friend, we shared a social circle."
00:06:52.036,00:06:52.870,Now we don't.
00:06:52.954,00:06:55.164,…about their presents this year. That's why I'm here.
00:06:55.248,00:06:58.000,I'm trying to find a present for my little sister. She's into fantasy.
00:06:58.084,00:07:02.880,"Yeah, I remember, at your party last year, she challenged me to a duel."
00:07:03.589,00:07:07.802,"About this year, um… I'm… I'm sorry I didn't invite you."
00:07:07.885,00:07:15.518,"I just… I thought it would be weird, you know, but since you're in town, you should totally still come. It's on Christmas Eve."
00:07:16.394,00:07:18.938,"Thanks, but my dad's taking me to Sweden tomorrow."
00:07:20.356,00:07:23.526,It's supposed to be beautiful in December. All those long Swedish nights.
00:07:25.611,00:07:26.487,Right.
00:07:27.321,00:07:28.739,"Well, that's too bad."
00:07:29.323,00:07:30.324,Sofia's coming.
00:07:31.909,00:07:34.704,"-Sofia's back? -Yeah, just for the holidays."
00:07:42.920,00:07:45.006,"Anything she should, uh, know?"
00:07:46.174,00:07:47.800,Tell her I'm trying new things.
00:07:48.634,00:07:49.469,Okay.
00:07:51.262,00:07:54.474,"Hey, wait, Priya, um… Here. For your sister."
00:07:54.557,00:07:59.270,I have a feeling she'd like it. It's fantasy for kids with weapons.
00:08:00.605,00:08:01.522,Merry Christmas.
00:08:08.237,00:08:11.032,with The Joy of Gay Sex bodes well for our future.
00:08:11.616,00:08:13.284,"However, a few rules."
00:08:13.367,00:08:16.496,"If you are not a teenage boy, please return the notebook to the shelf."
00:08:17.830,00:08:21.334,"if you have use for the manual in your hand, I completely support that."
00:08:21.417,00:08:26.380,"Love is a spectrum, but if girls aren't on yours, please return the notebook to the shelf."
00:08:26.881,00:08:42.688,"And finally, if you've made it this far, you're obviously clever, but I want to know… are you brave?"
00:08:51.197,00:08:52.365,Hello.
00:08:53.783,00:09:01.082,"Um, sorry to interrupt your browsing, um, but I have been asked to share a dramatic reading."
00:09:01.165,00:09:04.293,Um… And apologies to Joni Mitchell.
00:09:05.211,00:09:20.184,"Um… It's coming on Christmas. Um… They're cutting down trees, putting up reindeer, singing songs of joy and peace."
00:09:21.769,00:09:26.607,"Oh, I wish I had a river that I could skate away on."
00:09:29.193,00:09:37.535,"But it don't snow here… But I love this song, and if you chose it, that means you love it, too."
00:09:37.618,00:09:40.121,…crazy scene… Are you here now?
00:09:40.705,00:09:42.957,Did you turn up to see if I had the guts to follow through?
00:09:43.040,00:09:46.752,"Oh, I wish I had a river. I'm so hard to handle."
00:09:48.421,00:09:49.880,"I'm selfish, and I'm sad."
00:09:52.008,00:09:54.760,And now I've gone and lost the best baby I've ever had.
00:09:57.722,00:10:01.642,"Oh, I wish I had a river to skate away on."
00:10:05.187,00:10:06.939,It's coming on Christmas.
00:10:09.900,00:10:11.986,"-Whoa! Hey, hey. -I'm putting you out of your misery."
00:10:12.069,00:10:13.946,What are you doing? It's not the end of the song.
00:10:14.572,00:10:15.823,Got what you needed.
00:10:16.907,00:10:18.618,The last two words of the message?
00:10:19.327,00:10:20.286,You just said them.
00:10:31.380,00:10:34.759,"So, here we are. What happens next is up to you."
00:10:35.259,00:10:38.512,Leave a message telling me how this time of year makes you feel.
00:10:39.013,00:10:41.849,"If I like your answer, you just might hear from me."
00:10:42.433,00:10:43.976,If you're not scared.
00:10:44.644,00:10:45.478,Who is she?
00:10:46.771,00:10:48.648,"Even if I could tell you, I wouldn't."
00:10:49.190,00:10:51.734,You have to put that back so someone else can play.
00:10:53.110,00:10:54.987,Hey! I said leave it.
00:10:58.407,00:10:59.241,I'm hooked.
00:11:18.844,00:11:22.348,"Dude! You're going to Sweden, and you didn't tell me?"
00:11:23.432,00:11:24.350,How'd you…?
00:11:24.975,00:11:26.060,"Oh, Priya."
00:11:26.143,00:11:29.689,"Yeah. She texted and said you were acting weird. Like, even for you."
00:11:30.648,00:11:31.774,She say anything else?
00:11:34.068,00:11:35.820,"Just so you know, I'm a total ally."
00:11:38.698,00:11:39.824,And I'm not going to Sweden.
00:11:39.907,00:11:42.034,I'm just trying to avoid seeing anyone over the break.
00:11:42.118,00:11:43.619,"What, even me?"
00:11:44.120,00:11:46.580,"No, man. Need you for the pizza."
00:11:48.624,00:11:51.711,"Yeah. So, what's the Boomer clan doing for Christmas?"
00:11:51.794,00:11:53.379,"Oh, it's gonna be sick."
00:11:53.462,00:11:55.548,"So, you know my aunt who works for the Food Network?"
00:11:55.631,00:11:59.135,She's bringing over all the food that was too weird-looking to be on TV.
00:11:59.218,00:12:01.220,You gotta let me know when you open your presents.
00:12:01.303,00:12:02.430,Why?
00:12:02.513,00:12:04.557,"Well, because I helped your mom pick yours out."
00:12:04.640,00:12:05.891,-You gotta give me a hint. -What?
00:12:05.975,00:12:09.729,-No. I'm not gonna tell you what it is. -You gotta give me a hint. Give me a hint!
00:12:09.812,00:12:12.523,"Okay, you know those life-size Japanese robots that fight each other?"
00:12:12.606,00:12:14.567,-No. -It's not that.
00:12:29.707,00:12:31.208,What's that? You got a diary?
00:12:32.543,00:12:38.716,"Oh, no. I just found it at the Strand. Um… You don't recognize this handwriting, do you?"
00:12:38.799,00:12:40.342,"Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's a girl."
00:12:40.426,00:12:42.720,"Yeah, that's definitely girl cursive right there."
00:12:42.803,00:12:44.346,"Okay, but that's not Priya's, right?"
00:12:44.430,00:12:46.724,Pretty sure Priya only writes on her phone. Why?
00:12:46.807,00:12:48.726,"Oh, I'm just ruling out suspects."
00:12:49.185,00:12:55.399,"Uh, 'cause it had these clues, like a treasure hunt, and I've just been wondering about the girl who wrote it."
00:12:55.483,00:12:58.277,"Ooh, you like her."
00:12:58.360,00:13:01.947,"Boomer, we're not in third grade. We don't say, Ooh, you like her."
00:13:02.031,00:13:04.158,"-But you do. -No, I don't even know her."
00:13:04.241,00:13:06.786,Which is why it's even weirder that you like her.
00:13:06.869,00:13:13.167,"I mean, I haven't heard you talk about a girl since… Yep, you can say her name, Boomer. She's not Voldemort."
00:13:13.250,00:13:16.796,"Actually, you're supposed to say Voldemort's name. It takes away his power."
00:13:16.879,00:13:19.298,"Okay, look, I don't even know if I want to know this girl."
00:13:19.381,00:13:21.509,I would just like to figure out who she is.
00:13:21.592,00:13:24.053,Done. We set up a sting operation.
00:13:24.136,00:13:27.264,"Yeah. Okay, you send her a message telling her to order pizza from Two Boots."
00:13:27.348,00:13:30.684,"When she calls and places it, boom, we got her name."
00:13:30.768,00:13:32.478,It's… it's all there.
00:13:32.561,00:13:33.938,I will consider that.
00:13:35.397,00:13:37.900,-I'm gonna get this. -That looks cool. What's that?
00:13:37.983,00:13:40.486,It's a depressing French film about murder.
00:13:41.695,00:13:43.447,"All right, thanks for the pizza, Boomer."
00:13:52.122,00:13:53.833,Shit!
00:13:55.334,00:13:58.337,"Hey, Dad, did you change your alarm code for your apartment?"
00:14:00.339,00:14:01.966,"Yeah, no, I am spending the break with Mom."
00:14:02.049,00:14:04.718,But I just figure if I need a place to get away to read.
00:14:06.762,00:14:09.598,"Or sure, bring a special lady. Yeah."
00:14:10.558,00:14:11.725,Okay.
00:14:11.809,00:14:14.854,Great. I am writing it down now.
00:14:48.554,00:14:52.933,"My dad thinks I'm with my mom, and my classmates think I'm out of the city."
00:14:55.060,00:14:56.729,It's my Christmas gift to myself.
00:14:58.105,00:14:58.939,Solitude.
00:15:18.709,00:15:21.712,The word… bedding.
00:15:23.964,00:15:26.383,You American boys have the stupidest pillow talk.
00:15:26.467,00:15:37.978,"No, hear me out. It's one of those words where it's just either really sexy, you know, or it's really not, like, um… Can you show me to the bedding department? Right? It's not sexy."
00:15:38.062,00:15:42.816,"But then if you make it into a verb, like-- Are we going to be bedding each other?"
00:15:42.900,00:15:44.777,"Mmm. See, that's very sexy."
00:15:49.949,00:15:51.075,I'm going to miss you.
00:15:52.284,00:15:53.452,I'm not going anywhere.
00:15:55.788,00:15:56.914,Are you?
00:15:57.414,00:16:00.751,My dad got a new post. Brazil.
00:16:03.420,00:16:07.132,I'm sorry. We both knew this was never going to last forever.
00:16:08.384,00:16:10.928,"There you are. Can you stop hiding, love birds?"
00:16:11.011,00:16:12.137,It's a party.
00:16:44.586,00:16:53.053,"I suspect you're a kindred spirit, so I know you'll understand when I say, it's the most detestable time of the year."
00:17:08.027,00:17:10.237,I knew it. Sting operation.
00:17:10.320,00:17:12.197,"No. Please don't call it that. Just listen, okay?"
00:17:12.281,00:17:13.365,-You listening? -Yeah.
00:17:13.449,00:17:18.287,The clues are gonna instruct her to leave the notebook on one the shelves in the video section.
00:17:18.370,00:17:19.204,-Okay? -Okay.
00:17:19.288,00:17:23.333,"All you need to do is just keep an eye out for her, all right?"
00:17:24.084,00:17:27.796,"So, you can know she is without her knowing who you are?"
00:17:28.422,00:17:31.091,Isn't that kind of sneaky and not cool?
00:17:31.675,00:17:33.802,"Fine, we can call it a sting operation."
00:17:42.227,00:17:45.355,"All right, guys, we got our holiday special."
00:17:45.856,00:17:50.194,We call it the St. Nick. It's in honor Nicolas Cage.
00:18:03.999,00:18:05.292,How did you miss her?
00:18:05.375,00:18:08.003,-It was the lunch rush. -What about the security cameras?
00:18:08.087,00:18:09.129,What security cameras?
00:18:09.213,00:18:13.008,"-You said that it was a sting operation. -Yeah, but this is also a pizza parlor."
00:18:13.509,00:18:16.011,"-Uh, she left you a message. -What?"
00:18:16.095,00:18:16.929,Yeah.
00:18:20.641,00:18:22.059,You sent me into a trap.
00:18:22.142,00:18:24.478,Dude. What? How could she possibly know that?
00:18:24.561,00:18:27.189,"Uh, it gets worse. Like, way worse."
00:18:33.821,00:18:37.366,"If you wanna know more about me, you'll have to do it through this notebook."
00:18:37.449,00:18:42.079,"And if you want my name, you'll have to earn it… with a dare."
00:18:47.376,00:18:49.336,She could be totally different than what you think.
00:18:49.419,00:18:50.963,"That's the thing, Boomer. I do know her."
00:18:51.046,00:18:53.257,"When I read her words, it's like I can hear her voice."
00:18:53.340,00:18:58.512,"She's sarcastic, sophisticated… -sadistic. -Sadistic?"
00:18:58.595,00:19:01.223,She's sending me into a department store right before Christmas.
00:19:01.306,00:19:03.267,"Clearly, her sadism knows no bounds."
00:19:05.853,00:19:08.689,-Just be nice to Santa. Please? -Yep.
00:19:19.241,00:19:22.244,You can kick me out without actually kicking me.
00:19:22.744,00:19:25.205,Consider yourself banned from Santa Land for life.
00:19:25.289,00:19:29.418,"We actually do not have that authority, but you should be ashamed of yourself."
00:19:29.501,00:19:31.378,And you're on the naughty list.
00:19:31.461,00:19:33.964,"Well, I hope climate change destroys the North Pole."
00:19:43.432,00:19:45.058,and it only cost me my dignity.
00:19:45.142,00:19:47.311,"So, let's find out what I learned."
00:19:48.687,00:19:52.065,"What? No, what? Come on. What did I do wrong?"
00:19:52.149,00:19:58.614,"I did everything you asked, and I still don't know your… Lily."
00:20:01.408,00:20:02.576,Her name's Lily.
00:20:15.756,00:20:18.342,"Lily! Lily, thank God you're here."
00:20:18.425,00:20:21.094,-Is it bad? -Without you? They're terrible.
00:20:22.054,00:20:25.224,-Hey! Seriously? -Season's greetings.
00:20:29.811,00:20:31.438,"Oh, it's Lily. We're saved."
00:20:31.521,00:20:33.398,-Sorry I'm late. -We drank all the eggnog.
00:20:33.482,00:20:34.900,I was looking for these.
00:20:34.983,00:20:39.363,"Joy to the World, third verse. We need you, badly."
00:00:16.558,00:00:18.643,This is the greatest time of the year.
00:00:19.310,00:00:22.230,I love Christmas!
00:00:22.313,00:00:24.149,"I really, really do."
00:00:24.691,00:00:29.362,"And… and that's because, in my family, Christmas is all about love."
00:00:29.946,00:00:34.576,It's when my grandpa met my grandmother and my mom met my dad.
00:00:35.452,00:00:37.996,It's when my brother met his boyfriend.
00:00:38.079,00:00:38.997,They broke up.
00:00:39.831,00:00:41.541,I don't have my own love story.
00:00:41.624,00:00:43.126,"I… I mean, I tried."
00:00:43.626,00:00:48.006,"For a while, I had this fantasy I'd meet the perfect guy browsing at the Strand."
00:00:48.590,00:00:51.259,That's one of my favorites. Did you know it's set in New York?
00:00:51.342,00:00:54.471,All the best books are. Have you read Seymour: An Introduction?
00:00:54.554,00:00:56.389,I don't like it as much as Franny and Zooey.
00:00:56.473,00:01:02.062,"It's very stream of consciousness. Like, the narrator just says whatever pops into his head, which I guess is what I'm doing now."
00:01:02.145,00:01:06.149,"But, seriously, if you like Franny and Zooey, you should read Seymour."
00:01:07.525,00:01:08.818,This is for school.
00:01:10.236,00:01:11.154,Oh.
00:01:12.238,00:01:15.658,"My great aunt, Mrs. Basil E, says I'm an old soul."
00:01:16.159,00:01:19.287,"My brother, Langston, says I'm too cool for people my age."
00:01:20.288,00:01:21.915,I think they're just being nice.
00:01:23.833,00:01:26.628,But that's okay. I don't have a love story.
00:01:26.711,00:01:37.680,"But I have a family, and every December, I have an apartment full of decorations and relatives and platters of food and-- Why are you packed?"
00:01:41.142,00:01:43.061,"We're so sorry, honey."
00:01:43.144,00:01:46.064,"It's just, you know, your dad and I never had a honeymoon."
00:01:46.147,00:01:47.732,"And this year, we thought Fiji."
00:01:48.775,00:01:51.111,"You can handle one Christmas without us, right?"
00:01:53.571,00:01:55.573,Mabel needs me in Florida.
00:01:55.657,00:02:00.745,"You remember Mabel, my female friend who's not a girlfriend?"
00:02:17.303,00:02:20.390,I thought we could go to Dyker Heights to see the lights tonight.
00:02:20.932,00:02:22.183,Keep up tradition?
00:02:22.267,00:02:25.311,"I just got a date, and he's coming over right now."
00:02:26.020,00:02:28.648,"So, can you go somewhere?"
00:02:29.941,00:02:30.984,Of course.
00:02:44.330,00:02:45.206,I don't need one.
00:02:49.544,00:02:50.879,I have Christmas.
00:02:59.095,00:03:00.722,"-Ay, Dios mío. -Lily, get out!"
00:03:11.399,00:03:12.442,Can we try that again?
00:03:15.195,00:03:16.696,Do anything fun today?
00:03:16.779,00:03:18.489,I formed a caroling troupe.
00:03:19.073,00:03:21.117,And who exactly is in this caroling troupe?
00:03:21.201,00:03:24.871,"Just some friends from the neighborhood. Aaron, Roberta, Melvin."
00:03:24.954,00:03:27.373,"Lily, are you hanging out with adults again?"
00:03:27.457,00:03:30.168,They're easier to talk to. They read actual books.
00:03:30.251,00:03:31.711,They don't judge what I wear.
00:03:31.794,00:03:33.338,They drink a lot.
00:03:33.421,00:03:35.131,I'm sorry. This Christmas sucks.
00:03:35.215,00:03:37.133,It doesn't suck. It's fine. I am fine.
00:03:37.759,00:03:41.179,"Okay, you are not a Macy's Santa. You don't have to pretend to be jolly."
00:03:42.430,00:03:45.892,It's just… everyone has someone for Christmas except me.
00:03:48.061,00:03:49.520,"So, who is he?"
00:03:50.480,00:03:51.689,His name's Benny.
00:03:51.773,00:03:53.316,-He's a dancer. -Ooh.
00:03:53.399,00:03:55.652,"-Well, right now, he's a barista. -You love coffee."
00:03:56.361,00:03:57.695,I think I really like him.
00:03:58.988,00:04:00.031,I'm happy for you.
00:04:00.615,00:04:02.992,You're amazing. You will find someone amazing too.
00:04:03.076,00:04:04.911,I'm not like you.
00:04:04.994,00:04:07.956,I'm not good at meeting guys or talking to them.
00:04:08.581,00:04:10.208,I'm good at scaring them away.
00:04:10.291,00:04:12.168,Can you give me tips? They won't leave me alone.
00:04:12.252,00:04:14.921,"-It's exhausting. -Here's a tip, delete Grindr."
00:04:20.051,00:04:21.970,Mrs. Basil E used to give them to us.
00:04:22.053,00:04:25.348,She said it would be good for me to have an outlet for my feelings.
00:04:29.060,00:04:32.981,"If there's something I can't say out loud, I write it down here."
00:04:35.525,00:04:36.693,That's perfect.
00:04:37.694,00:04:39.112,-Hey. -Way better than Grindr.
00:04:39.195,00:04:42.824,"-Here, give me that pen. -Hey, what are we doing?"
00:04:42.907,00:04:44.617,Devising a quest to help her find a soulmate.
00:04:44.701,00:04:46.452,-Okay. -Can I help?
00:04:46.536,00:04:48.371,It'll be like a scavenger hunt. Grab some books.
00:04:48.454,00:04:50.331,-We can use them for clues. -What?
00:04:50.415,00:04:52.583,"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe."
00:04:52.667,00:04:54.210,Fat Hoochie Prom Queen.
00:04:54.294,00:04:55.586,The Joy of Gay Sex?
00:04:58.047,00:05:01.384,"Oh, that's mine. I have been looking for that."
00:05:01.467,00:05:04.345,I'm only allowing this because I know it will never work.
00:05:04.846,00:05:11.477,"Hey, I haven't told you the best part yet. You're going to hide it… at the Strand."
00:05:14.230,00:05:15.606,Next to Franny and Zooey.
00:05:19.736,00:05:23.614,"Fine, but it's my notebook. I get to pick something to include."
00:05:24.282,00:05:25.158,You have a clue?
00:05:34.459,00:05:36.753,"Aw, that song is so sad."
00:05:36.836,00:05:38.588,"Oh, I think it's perfect."
00:06:34.018,00:06:36.104,"Play it cool, Lily. Play it cool, Lily."
00:06:36.187,00:06:40.441,"Was he nice? Was he cute? Okay, are you sure he was a teenage boy?"
00:06:40.525,00:06:41.984,How would you describe him?
00:06:42.068,00:06:43.152,Snarly.
00:06:44.070,00:06:45.279,Snarly?
00:06:45.363,00:06:48.533,"And annoyingly pedantic. He committed to the Joni, though."
00:06:49.450,00:06:50.618,Did he leave a message?
00:06:51.661,00:06:52.954,He left instructions.
00:07:01.504,00:07:06.259,"Not for just anyone, but apparently, Clue Girl, I dare for you."
00:07:07.760,00:07:10.430,I admire your words. I salute your choice of music.
00:07:10.513,00:07:17.228,"I'm not sure how I feel about your fiendish bent towards public spectacle, but I have to confess, you intrigue me."
00:07:17.728,00:07:19.939,You asked me how this time of year makes me feel.
00:07:20.022,00:07:28.656,"I suspect you're a kindred spirit, so I know you'll understand when I say… -He hates Christmas. -Lily! Get out of my room."
00:07:29.407,00:07:30.366,You got a taker?
00:07:31.242,00:07:32.326,What did he say?
00:07:32.910,00:07:35.246,It's the most detestable time of the year.
00:07:35.329,00:07:37.665,"The forced cheer, the frenzied crowds."
00:07:38.166,00:07:41.961,"-Wow, did he get you wrong. -Because of you! You wrote those clues."
00:07:42.044,00:07:45.548,You made me sound jaded and snarky and cool.
00:07:45.631,00:07:46.883,I think you're cool.
00:07:46.966,00:07:48.551,"Oh, thanks, Benny."
00:07:48.634,00:07:51.387,He left his own clues. He wants me to follow them.
00:07:51.471,00:07:53.139,Great. Tell us how it goes.
00:07:53.723,00:07:57.018,I'm not doing it. We… we obviously have nothing in common.
00:07:57.101,00:08:00.646,"Lily, I love you. I would never make you do anything you don't want to do."
00:08:01.939,00:08:03.733,-But? -But what?
00:08:03.816,00:08:05.526,Put the book back on the shelf and try again.
00:08:05.610,00:08:07.778,I thought you'd say I should give him another chance.
00:08:07.862,00:08:10.031,"That's not how love works. You feel it, or you don't."
00:08:11.824,00:08:13.868,So close the door on your way out.
00:08:46.776,00:08:55.618,"But that seems scary, while caroling is cozy and safe and… Don't tell me you forgot the words."
00:08:58.162,00:09:01.332,-Do you know those girls? -They're on my soccer team.
00:09:13.886,00:09:17.265,"Okay, so, I mapped out all the places I thought we could sing next."
00:09:17.348,00:09:20.977,"-The best parks and blocks, and there's-- -It's too cold to keep singing."
00:09:21.060,00:09:22.687,Then we could do something else.
00:09:22.770,00:09:27.275,"There's that new Pixar movie, Collation, about the stapler who falls in love with the piece of paper."
00:09:27.358,00:09:30.027,-I've got a night shift at the ER. -I've got a thesis to finish.
00:09:30.111,00:09:31.195,I've got a life.
00:09:32.738,00:09:34.824,We could just get a cup of hot chocolate.
00:09:36.617,00:09:38.494,Or we could go to a bar.
00:09:40.413,00:09:41.539,"Look, Lily."
00:09:43.124,00:09:45.543,I didn't have that many friends when I was your age either.
00:09:45.626,00:09:47.253,"Teenagers are shits, no offense."
00:09:48.588,00:09:52.049,"But if you don't wanna be alone, maybe you need to expand your bubble."
00:09:52.800,00:09:53.926,I don't have a bubble.
00:09:55.136,00:09:56.012,Look at your map.
00:10:08.941,00:10:16.073,"The forced cheer, frenzied crowds, the feeling that you're expected to be joyful, even when you're not."
00:10:16.157,00:10:20.703,"Because, when you're alone at Christmas, it's somehow worse than the rest of the year."
00:10:23.831,00:10:26.709,"If you know what I mean, turn the page."
00:10:44.935,00:10:46.646,Go to the location on the menu.
00:10:50.399,00:10:52.318,"-Have a Boot-licous day, man. -Thanks a lot."
00:10:59.075,00:11:00.076,you can find.
00:11:15.466,00:11:17.802,Wait. You're notebook girl.
00:11:21.972,00:11:23.474,He wanted you to spy on me?
00:11:23.557,00:11:26.644,I believe the phrase he used was… was sting operation.
00:11:27.186,00:11:29.480,-You can't tell him you saw me. -Why?
00:11:29.563,00:11:31.232,Because I don't want him to know who I am.
00:11:31.315,00:11:33.150,-But don't you want to meet him? -No.
00:11:33.943,00:11:36.070,Not yet. I don't know.
00:11:36.737,00:11:41.909,"I want to get to know him, but it… it's easier to do it in there."
00:11:43.327,00:11:45.746,"Yeah, okay. There's something I don't understand."
00:11:45.830,00:11:49.041,Weren't you supposed to put this next to a depressing Christmas movie?
00:11:49.125,00:11:51.836,What's depressing about Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer?
00:11:51.919,00:11:58.884,"Reindeer are herbivores who would never hurt anyone, but that wouldn't stop the wildlife service from hunting the poor guy down."
00:11:58.968,00:11:59.927,"Oh, no."
00:12:00.010,00:12:02.763,Even though it was probably Grandma's fault for getting in the way.
00:12:02.847,00:12:04.849,-That is depressing. -Right?
00:12:08.644,00:12:10.646,"What's he like, your friend?"
00:12:11.188,00:12:13.524,I don't think he'd want me to answer that question.
00:12:13.607,00:12:14.692,Is he snarly?
00:12:15.901,00:12:17.945,The word my mom uses is finicky.
00:12:18.487,00:12:22.867,"He's, uh… He's complicated."
00:12:22.950,00:12:25.578,All right? He has a lot of walls.
00:12:25.661,00:12:29.832,"But, once he lets you in, he's the most loyal friend you could have."
00:12:32.168,00:12:33.002,Can I?
00:12:33.878,00:12:34.712,Trust you?
00:12:36.380,00:12:38.924,"I mean, you did come during lunch rush."
00:12:39.008,00:12:41.177,It gets super busy. Right?
00:12:41.260,00:12:45.222,"So it's totally possible that you dropped off the notebook, and I never saw you."
00:12:45.931,00:12:47.224,You would do that for me?
00:12:51.353,00:12:52.980,Because you're not Sofia.
00:12:54.732,00:12:58.235,"But, look, you gotta at least give him something, or he'll never forgive me."
00:12:58.319,00:13:01.739,"-Can't you at least tell him your name? -No, he tried to trick me."
00:13:02.907,00:13:05.659,"Unless… Your friend hates Christmas, right?"
00:13:06.160,00:13:07.286,Yeah.
00:13:07.369,00:13:10.623,"If he wants my name, he's gonna have to earn it."
00:13:13.626,00:13:15.252,He's gonna have to ask Santa.
00:13:20.382,00:13:24.678,"Look, or maybe she just wants you to, I don't know, feel the holiday spirit."
00:13:24.762,00:13:28.098,"No, no, I think I know her a little bit better than you do, Boomer."
00:13:29.016,00:13:31.769,-Just be nice to Santa. Please? -Yep.
00:13:37.107,00:13:41.237,"if you're brave enough to accept it, I dare you to ask Santa for my name."
00:13:41.737,00:13:49.995,"If you've been a good boy this year, you've got nothing to worry about, but if you want to get past the Santa guard, you might have to get naughty."
00:13:50.079,00:13:51.288,Twelve and under.
00:13:51.372,00:13:54.792,"-Well, I think you can make an exception. -Twelve and under only."
00:13:57.503,00:14:03.968,"Well, I bet The New York Times would be very interested to know that you've made it a store policy to discriminate against teenagers."
00:14:04.051,00:14:05.511,Teenagers cause trouble.
00:14:06.095,00:14:07.012,"Well, I'm 11."
00:14:08.138,00:14:09.557,-Tall for my age. -Calling security.
00:14:09.640,00:14:11.517,-No. You don't need to-- -Do I know you?
00:14:11.600,00:14:15.104,-Not unless you've been to the North Pole. -I swear I've seen you before.
00:14:15.187,00:14:16.313,You're an actor.
00:14:17.273,00:14:23.112,I knew it. You were on SVU. You… you played the… the murderer-- -The corpse. -The murdered corpse.
00:14:23.195,00:14:24.530,You saw that?
00:14:24.613,00:14:28.450,You know what? Your performance was incredible.
00:14:28.534,00:14:30.494,"Like, I legit thought you were dead."
00:14:31.161,00:14:32.079,Thank you so much.
00:14:32.913,00:14:34.540,"Whoa. Sorry, it's an emergency."
00:14:34.623,00:14:40.212,"Ho ho ho, we got a big boy, but, as I like to say, you're never too old for Santa."
00:14:43.382,00:14:45.426,"No, no, no. I'm not here for that."
00:14:45.509,00:14:49.221,"Um, I was sent by… Ah."
00:14:49.722,00:14:51.307,-Our mutual friend. -Yes.
00:14:51.390,00:14:54.268,-Yes. So do you have something for me? -Right up here.
00:14:54.351,00:14:56.395,-In your head? -In my hat.
00:14:56.478,00:15:00.482,"Oh, okay. Um… I actually understudied Shakespeare in the Park too."
00:15:00.566,00:15:03.027,No way. What park?
00:15:04.570,00:15:06.906,Come. Sit on my lap first.
00:15:07.740,00:15:09.909,"-Uh, no. I mean, I'm kind of in a rush-- -Come on."
00:15:09.992,00:15:13.162,"If you want a present from Santa, you gotta sit on his lap."
00:15:14.288,00:15:17.249,Will you hurry up? There are children waiting.
00:15:20.878,00:15:21.795,Fine.
00:15:28.677,00:15:30.346,"I wanna give you a warning, punk."
00:15:30.429,00:15:37.645,"Our mutual friend happens to be very special to me, and I don't want her dating some snarky teenage smart-ass."
00:15:37.728,00:15:39.605,Ow! Just give me the hat.
00:15:39.688,00:15:41.273,Promise me you won't hurt her.
00:15:41.357,00:15:42.483,You are hurting me.
00:15:44.568,00:15:46.695,I'm gonna need backup in Santaland.
00:15:48.822,00:15:52.743,"If you don't give me the hat, I'll tell all these nice children Santa's breath smells like bourbon."
00:15:52.826,00:15:55.663,"I am six years sober, asshole!"
00:15:56.455,00:15:58.123,I'm gonna need you to come quietly.
00:16:01.460,00:16:03.379,"-Oh, he took my hat! -He stole Santa's hat."
00:16:16.350,00:16:19.603,"Huh? I'm leaving with this hat, and no one's gonna get hurt, okay?"
00:16:22.481,00:16:25.109,You think you're the first teenager to mess with Santa?
00:16:25.192,00:16:27.778,"That's why, this year, all us elves took capoeira."
00:16:28.612,00:16:29.446,Now let's go.
00:16:33.283,00:16:35.411,do you feel the holiday spirit?
00:16:38.330,00:16:39.581,You're actually smiling.
00:16:40.165,00:16:41.750,It's a Christmas miracle.
00:16:42.459,00:16:45.295,"-Well, I did get a present from Santa. -You had fun."
00:16:45.379,00:16:47.256,"If you tell anyone, I will deny it."
00:16:47.923,00:16:49.133,I got a present too.
00:16:49.216,00:16:51.218,-Is that an autographed headshot? -Yeah.
00:16:51.885,00:16:54.388,The elf was actually really cool. He's like a celebrity.
00:16:54.471,00:16:55.931,He was on Law &amp; Order: SVU.
00:16:57.141,00:16:58.267,Her name is Lily.
00:16:58.350,00:16:59.268,I like that name.
00:17:00.644,00:17:01.562,"Yeah, me too."
00:17:02.980,00:17:05.691,"Um… Hey, could you do me one more favor?"
00:17:05.774,00:17:09.570,"I would do it myself, but I can never go back in there, ever."
00:17:10.904,00:17:11.739,Yeah?
00:17:32.051,00:17:34.428,-Do you have something for me? -Yeah.
00:17:34.511,00:17:38.223,He turned up at the end of my shift with a plate of milk and cookies.
00:17:40.059,00:17:43.771,"I don't like that boy, Lily. I don't think your grandfather would either."
00:17:43.854,00:17:45.230,Grandpa's in Florida.
00:17:45.314,00:17:46.815,I'm just looking out for you.
00:17:47.900,00:17:49.193,"Merry Christmas, kid."
00:17:49.276,00:17:50.736,"Merry Christmas, Uncle Sal."
00:18:43.831,00:18:44.957,you win.
00:18:45.040,00:18:48.293,"If we're gonna do this, then I agree to follow your rules."
00:18:50.129,00:18:52.673,No sting operations. No last names.
00:18:52.756,00:18:54.967,No social media stalking.
00:18:55.050,00:18:56.677,No pressure to meet.
00:18:57.553,00:19:02.474,"Personal questions are fair game, but they have to be earned with a dare."
00:19:04.893,00:19:06.895,"Well, I did your dare."
00:19:08.188,00:20:28.143,"So, tell me, Lily… Yeah."
00:20:30.270,00:20:32.814,I hope you like them. I made them myself.
00:20:32.898,00:20:34.524,-You made them yourself? -Mm-hmm.
00:20:35.067,00:20:35.984,Mmm.
00:00:17.434,00:00:21.646,"Take me somewhere special, someplace in the city that feels like you."
00:00:25.483,00:00:26.443,It's a time.
00:00:28.028,00:00:31.072,Be inside Grand Central Terminal before the first train arrives.
00:00:40.582,00:00:47.589,"There are few moments when you can find stillness in the middle of the city, when you can enjoy the heart of New York without the crush of people."
00:00:49.507,00:00:50.592,Tell me what you see.
00:00:58.058,00:01:01.811,"But in here, the sky is lit up with constellations."
00:01:03.271,00:01:07.442,The world feels big and small and all mine.
00:01:26.544,00:01:27.629,It's your turn.
00:01:28.129,00:01:29.756,"Hey, dude, look up."
00:01:32.801,00:01:34.260,Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
00:01:37.514,00:01:39.057,-Hey. -Here you go.
00:01:40.433,00:01:41.851,I'll see ya. Appreciate it.
00:01:43.937,00:01:46.356,but you don't have to get up so early to find it.
00:01:47.690,00:01:50.360,You just need a lesson from my cousin in Central Park.
00:01:51.820,00:01:55.323,He's a Zen master. He can tune out any kind of noise.
00:01:59.035,00:02:05.041,"If you can last ten minutes doing what he does, leave the notebook and your next dare with him, and our game can continue."
00:02:20.140,00:02:20.974,Fair is fair.
00:02:26.980,00:02:28.857,but I can't give you my name.
00:02:28.940,00:02:32.861,It's too particular. It'd be way too easy to figure out who I am.
00:02:32.944,00:02:37.532,But I will give you a clue. My name is a connector of words.
00:02:41.119,00:02:47.542,"Now that I am starving from trying not to pummel snarky preteens, let's get a snack."
00:02:47.625,00:02:51.546,Find the cart at 72nd and 2nd and ask for Lot's Wife.
00:02:51.629,00:02:55.175,"Ooh, that's a lot of salt. I'm supposed to eat this thing?"
00:02:55.258,00:02:57.719,"Okay, was that my punishment for asking your name?"
00:02:57.802,00:03:00.138,Because you can be as salty as you want.
00:03:00.221,00:03:01.181,I'm not giving up.
00:03:02.724,00:03:05.101,"So, a connector of words."
00:03:05.185,00:03:09.105,Is your name Or or And? Andy?
00:03:10.732,00:03:12.233,"Yeah, I'm gonna call you Andy."
00:03:12.734,00:03:15.486,"So, Andy, your favorite treats are salty."
00:03:15.570,00:03:16.404,Thanks.
00:03:16.487,00:03:17.614,Mine are very sweet.
00:03:19.782,00:03:20.617,Thank you.
00:03:23.745,00:03:25.538,it's the sweetest time of the year.
00:03:30.919,00:03:32.754,I know even you have at least one.
00:03:38.551,00:03:41.471,"Andys are gullible, indiscriminate in their taste."
00:03:41.554,00:03:45.767,Andy would never have found you in the Salinger section of the Strand.
00:03:46.809,00:03:50.021,"As for your dare, I was ten years old."
00:03:50.104,00:03:56.361,My mom and dad told me I was gonna have two Christmases that year.
00:03:57.028,00:04:00.490,"Two trees, two sets of presents."
00:04:01.532,00:04:06.412,I was so excited until they told me they were getting divorced.
00:04:07.705,00:04:13.795,"And that year, I only asked Santa for one thing, for my parents to get back together."
00:04:15.004,00:04:25.223,"Look, I survived, but my best Christmas turned out to be the last time I believed in Santa or miracles or parents who tell you the truth."
00:04:27.267,00:04:29.185,"Enough about me. Misery loves company, Lil."
00:04:29.269,00:04:31.271,Tell me about your worst Christmas.
00:04:33.231,00:04:34.941,I know even you have at least one.
00:04:38.611,00:04:41.114,"My parents are in Fiji, my grandpa's in Florida."
00:04:46.536,00:04:49.205,"So, I'd like to say my worst Christmas is this one."
00:04:52.125,00:04:54.294,"Except, that would be a lie."
00:04:59.132,00:05:01.718,"You told me something personal, something that hurt."
00:05:02.885,00:05:05.805,"So, I guess I owe you the same."
00:05:07.473,00:05:11.060,My worst Christmas was the year of the friendship bracelets in middle school.
00:05:13.354,00:05:16.024,I begged my parents to let me go to the winter dance.
00:05:17.900,00:05:19.319,I've always loved making things.
00:05:19.986,00:05:21.279,I make my own clothes.
00:05:21.362,00:05:29.287,"As my great aunt, Mrs. Basil E says, Your clothes are your inside on your outside, and you shouldn't leave that to mass manufacturers."
00:05:32.665,00:05:36.669,So I made friendship bracelets as a Christmas present for everyone at the dance.
00:05:38.963,00:05:42.592,"I, uh, chose the neglected fabrics in the back of the store."
00:05:43.092,00:05:44.802,The ones no one was picking.
00:05:46.012,00:05:48.181,I figured I could relate.
00:05:51.434,00:05:52.518,Did you make me one?
00:05:56.814,00:06:01.444,"I mean, my dream journal was filled with conversations I hoped we'd have one day."
00:06:02.362,00:06:05.281,I had such a crush on him. Everybody did.
00:06:07.784,00:06:10.745,"And here he was, demanding one of my creations."
00:06:11.496,00:06:15.333,"All his friends were watching, and I thought, This is my moment."
00:06:46.656,00:06:47.824,Can you believe her?
00:06:49.867,00:06:51.577,That girl is so weird.
00:06:58.292,00:06:59.836,That I'd always fit in.
00:07:02.046,00:07:03.548,All I had to do was be me.
00:07:05.383,00:07:11.681,"After that, I started to feel like Alice in Wonderland, like school was full of all these rules that didn't make sense."
00:07:12.890,00:07:16.269,"Like, if you want people to like you, don't be yourself."
00:07:22.400,00:07:27.113,"Ah, these children… They don't understand you."
00:07:29.115,00:07:30.283,Let's get ice cream.
00:07:39.542,00:07:41.794,hasn't won me giant parties full of friends.
00:07:41.878,00:07:45.089,I don't really go to parties or get invited to them.
00:07:52.638,00:07:55.600,I guess it's easier to admit this stuff to someone you've never met.
00:07:56.601,00:08:08.654,"Maybe I've scared you off, but, if not, and I hope not, leave your next dare in Central Park… with the patron saint of weird girls."
00:08:24.086,00:08:30.676,"Honestly, the first thing that I wrote was how I wanted to go back in time and just end the evil little twerp who called her weird."
00:08:30.760,00:08:36.349,"I described the whole thing, like exactly how I would do it, which actually included a plan for a fairly credible time machine."
00:08:36.432,00:08:39.602,"But I didn't want her to think I was a Cro-Magnon idiot, so then I threw it out."
00:08:39.685,00:08:43.397,"Oh, it's so cute how protective you are over your paper girlfriend."
00:08:44.899,00:08:48.402,"-She's not my girlfriend. -She's… she's kind of your girlfriend, no?"
00:08:50.446,00:08:53.407,"-Pretty sure she's your girlfriend. -No, no. Stop that, stop that."
00:08:53.491,00:08:56.619,"Hey, hey, hey. Dov, Yohnny, don't be tearing stuff off."
00:08:56.702,00:08:59.539,"-Yo, this shit's old. -Dov, come on, man, you're littering."
00:08:59.622,00:09:02.208,"Man, I'm making way for the new."
00:09:02.291,00:09:05.211,"-This is time-sensitive, brother. -You guys playing a show?"
00:09:07.129,00:09:08.297,Secret show?
00:09:11.342,00:09:13.094,"Uh, guys, you left off the address."
00:09:15.930,00:09:23.813,Yohnny's beautifully xeroxed photo of a loaf of challah is a beacon to all the kooks and weirdos who follow the Challah Back Boys.
00:09:23.896,00:09:25.273,"Believe me, they'll get it."
00:09:25.356,00:09:26.274,This is tonight?
00:09:26.357,00:09:28.234,Did I not just say the seventh night of Hanukkah?
00:09:30.278,00:09:31.737,-I need this. -Are you coming?
00:09:32.989,00:09:33.823,No.
00:09:34.323,00:09:35.616,-Goyim are welcome. -Here.
00:09:36.242,00:09:38.327,"I knew he wasn't coming, but I get it, though."
00:10:11.027,00:10:11.861,Happy Hanukkah.
00:10:12.820,00:10:13.821,It's a punk show.
00:10:15.072,00:10:16.490,A Jewish punk show?
00:10:17.742,00:10:18.826,Jewcore?
00:10:19.619,00:10:20.453,I love New York.
00:10:20.536,00:10:22.413,You have to help me get out of this.
00:10:22.496,00:10:25.833,"Um, I could tell him I'm sick. I… I could tell him I got bit by a spider."
00:10:25.916,00:10:29.211,"No, that's stupid. You could tell him I got bit by a spider."
00:10:29.295,00:10:31.589,Or you could just go.
00:10:31.672,00:10:32.715,I can't.
00:10:33.883,00:10:36.302,-Why? -Because it's two in the morning.
00:10:36.385,00:10:37.428,That sounds like an excuse.
00:10:37.511,00:10:43.100,"Because I'll do something stupid and embarrassing, and then he'll realize that I'm not the girl in his head, and he'll stop writing to me."
00:10:43.184,00:10:46.145,Okay. You have done a lot of dares for this guy already.
00:10:46.228,00:10:47.772,What is so different now?
00:10:48.272,00:10:51.025,I guess… I'm sort of starting to like him.
00:10:52.860,00:10:54.445,What if I ruin everything?
00:10:57.114,00:10:57.948,"Hey, Benny."
00:10:58.032,00:11:00.993,"-Oh, this comforter is giving me lovies. -Right?"
00:11:01.077,00:11:02.578,-Can we take it to the roof? -Yeah.
00:11:02.662,00:11:06.499,-You guys are sleeping on the roof again? -It is very cold but extremely romantic.
00:11:07.083,00:11:11.003,-It's like we're camping in Antarctica. -It is. You're so smart.
00:11:11.087,00:11:12.672,-You're so smart. -You're smart.
00:11:12.755,00:11:14.757,Or you could come with me.
00:11:16.717,00:11:18.052,And leave the house?
00:11:18.135,00:11:19.887,My sister's nervous about clubbing.
00:11:24.266,00:11:29.271,-Wh… what do you do for fun? -Um-- She sews her own clothes and plays board games with Grandpa.
00:11:30.314,00:11:32.316,"Please make her into a teenager, Benny."
00:11:32.400,00:11:37.196,"Don't worry, honey. I got this. Lily, I know everything about clubbing."
00:11:38.030,00:11:41.367,Allow Benny to prepare you mentally and fabulously.
00:11:42.827,00:11:43.661,Will it hurt?
00:11:44.537,00:11:48.165,Let's start with the outfit. You make your own clothes. Why?
00:11:48.791,00:11:50.084,I like to express myself.
00:11:50.960,00:11:51.794,Perfect.
00:11:51.877,00:11:54.964,"You need something that's you but bigger, sexier."
00:11:55.798,00:11:58.926,"What's something you've always wanted to wear, but you've never had the guts?"
00:12:09.019,00:12:11.397,"I found it at a thrift store, and I've been fixing it up."
00:12:11.480,00:12:13.441,But I would never wear this in public.
00:12:14.525,00:12:16.777,-I wouldn't. I couldn't. -Honey.
00:12:17.611,00:12:18.696,Tonight's the night.
00:13:04.575,00:13:06.827,"Oh, my God. It's you."
00:13:06.911,00:13:08.120,I'm Lily.
00:13:09.079,00:13:09.914,You're Lily?
00:13:16.629,00:13:18.881,Wait. Where are you going?
00:13:18.964,00:13:21.383,"No, no, no. Go… go play board games with your grandpa, Lily."
00:13:21.467,00:13:22.635,You do not belong here.
00:13:22.718,00:13:25.888,-What? -It's no wonder you need this thing.
00:13:29.809,00:13:32.186,Can you believe her? That girl is so weird.
00:13:54.667,00:13:55.501,Oh.
00:14:12.184,00:14:13.018,Come on.
00:14:15.604,00:14:16.438,Trust me.
00:14:32.413,00:14:35.374,"If you're staring at challah, congratulations, you made it."
00:14:38.210,00:14:40.629,"Hi, I'm looking for a club."
00:14:43.716,00:14:45.968,What's bringing you down on this fine evening?
00:14:46.051,00:14:47.636,Does something have to bring me down?
00:14:47.720,00:14:49.430,It does if you want to get inside.
00:14:50.389,00:14:53.267,Are you telling me that all's right in your world?
00:14:53.350,00:14:58.606,"-It's Christmas, and my parents are gone. -Oh, my word. Sweetie, I am so sorry."
00:14:59.440,00:15:02.151,"-How long since they passed? -Oh, no, no, no."
00:15:02.234,00:15:05.195,"-They're not dead. They're in Fiji. -Girl, get out of here."
00:15:05.279,00:15:07.531,"No, no, no, no. Wait. I have to get in there."
00:15:07.615,00:15:09.408,"-No, you don't. -I'm meeting someone."
00:15:09.491,00:15:10.451,Not in there you're not.
00:15:10.534,00:15:17.458,"No, but the guy in there is gonna get me to this other guy, and… I don't wanna play board games with my grandpa for the rest of my life."
00:15:17.541,00:15:22.087,Then give me some pain. I need a real drag. What is so important-- I've never been kissed.
00:15:23.172,00:15:25.466,-How old are you? -I'm 17.
00:15:27.301,00:15:28.135,Okay.
00:15:34.433,00:15:36.310,"Girl, get down there and rectify your situation."
00:15:36.393,00:15:38.520,-Thank you. -Down the rabbit hole.
00:16:11.387,00:16:12.388,That's my friend.
00:16:12.471,00:16:14.181,"-No, I was just-- -You know what?"
00:16:14.264,00:16:19.478,"We're not putting up with Tiffany's shit, and we're not putting up with yours."
00:16:21.981,00:16:23.232,I just got that drink.
00:17:30.883,00:17:33.510,Where's my Maccabees?
00:17:36.847,00:17:40.309,A little Hanukkah primer in case you slept through Hebrew school.
00:17:40.392,00:17:51.528,"So back in the second century, a band of Jewish rebels were driven from their temple, but they rose up. They took it back, and they partied for eight straight nights!"
00:17:54.031,00:17:55.657,And that's the spirit of Hanukkah.
00:17:55.741,00:17:59.620,"Rising up against your oppressors, not letting other people define you."
00:18:00.120,00:18:01.205,What's more punk than that?
00:18:01.288,00:18:04.458,So are you ready to punch oppression in the freaking face?
00:18:05.959,00:18:09.588,Let's challah!
00:18:24.770,00:18:26.480,"Oh, my God, Aryn?"
00:18:26.563,00:18:27.773,What are you doing here?
00:18:27.856,00:18:29.691,Are you kidding? This music's lit.
00:18:29.775,00:18:30.984,What are you doing here?
00:18:33.529,00:18:35.197,"Well, it's cool seeing you out."
00:18:35.823,00:18:36.657,Sick boots.
00:18:40.536,00:18:44.998,"Sweetie, you are not gonna get kissed on the sidelines, okay?"
00:18:45.082,00:18:46.083,-Come on. -No.
00:18:46.166,00:18:48.127,"No, come on. Excuse me, coming through."
00:18:48.210,00:18:50.796,"Mazel, mazel. Coming through."
00:18:50.879,00:18:52.548,"You show them what you got, okay?"
00:20:21.845,00:20:23.722,"Yeah, guys! Yeah!"
00:20:33.232,00:20:36.318,"Yo, yo. Red notebook. That's our girl."
00:20:47.496,00:20:48.497,That's my crown.
00:21:04.930,00:21:05.764,Lily?
00:21:08.225,00:21:10.185,"-Lily. -Oh, my God."
00:21:13.063,00:21:15.065,"It's Edgar Thibaud, from middle school."
00:21:17.567,00:21:21.029,I… I knew it was you. I… It's so random seeing you here.
00:21:21.113,00:21:23.240,"Hey, dope moves."
00:21:23.323,00:21:24.866,You saw all that?
00:21:24.950,00:21:27.411,Did you bring a notebook to a club?
00:21:29.496,00:21:31.623,You are so weird.
00:21:31.707,00:21:33.083,That girl is so weird.
00:21:37.713,00:21:38.714,So weird.
00:21:40.966,00:21:43.051,You are so weird.
00:21:43.719,00:21:44.970,So weird.
00:21:47.597,00:21:49.016,So weird.
00:22:08.952,00:22:10.954,"I failed you, and I failed Hanukkah."
00:22:11.747,00:22:16.668,"I didn't stand up to my oppressor, and I forgot to leave the notebook behind."
00:22:16.752,00:22:17.586,No.
00:22:17.669,00:22:19.546,So how are you gonna find me now?
00:22:22.132,00:22:24.259,"You're not, that's how."
00:22:26.470,00:22:29.598,"And… and you shouldn't, because I'm not just the weird girl."
00:22:30.390,00:22:31.224,I'm a loser.
00:22:35.312,00:22:38.023,"Okay, it's four in the morning."
00:22:51.953,00:22:54.164,"-Go, go, go. -Please pick up. Please pick up."
00:22:56.875,00:23:04.633,"Grandpa! Um, I think someone broke into the house, Oranges?"
00:23:05.801,00:23:07.094,"Oh, no."
00:23:08.720,00:23:09.971,Grandpa. You're home.
00:23:11.348,00:23:13.975,You're grounded. Forever!
00:00:16.641,00:00:19.144,"Hey. Hey, Dov."
00:00:19.644,00:00:21.312,"-Hey, Dash. -Hey."
00:00:21.396,00:00:25.066,-I'm a little busy. Can we do this later? -Can I get… can I just get the notebook?
00:00:29.237,00:00:32.532,Hey. Can I get the red notebook that Lily gave to you last night?
00:00:32.615,00:00:34.242,-I don't have it. -Where is it?
00:00:40.165,00:00:41.916,What do you mean? She didn't come?
00:00:42.625,00:00:43.460,"No, she did."
00:00:44.169,00:00:45.628,"That girl's wild, man."
00:00:45.712,00:00:51.176,Busted some exquisite moves in her bizarro red boots.
00:00:51.259,00:00:52.302,Really?
00:00:52.385,00:00:53.928,"Yeah, and then poof!"
00:00:54.721,00:00:55.638,Disappeared.
00:00:56.639,00:00:57.474,Magic.
00:00:57.557,00:00:59.559,"If she came here, she must have left it somewhere."
00:01:36.930,00:01:38.848,"Come on. Come on, let's go home."
00:01:39.766,00:01:40.850,Come on!
00:01:41.434,00:01:43.144,Yohnny!
00:01:46.314,00:01:47.148,Find the book?
00:01:49.776,00:01:51.277,This was such a mistake.
00:01:52.112,00:01:52.946,What?
00:01:53.822,00:01:54.906,She was having fun.
00:01:54.989,00:02:02.163,"No, she was scared 'cause I pushed her too far, and now I don't even have the notebook, so I can't even, like, apologize or, like, explain."
00:02:03.331,00:02:04.999,She was the queen.
00:02:08.169,00:02:09.087,She was the queen.
00:02:10.672,00:02:11.923,-Come on. -No.
00:02:33.903,00:02:35.488,"Hey, it's your girl's boot."
00:02:35.989,00:02:37.574,Why would she just leave her boot?
00:02:37.657,00:02:40.827,"Maybe she wanted you to find it, like a clue."
00:02:43.746,00:02:45.165,"Uh, ooh."
00:02:45.790,00:02:47.584,TDF. What's TDF?
00:02:48.710,00:02:50.545,Tilly Don Feinstein.
00:02:50.628,00:02:53.381,"He works at the information desk, and he has brown hair."
00:02:55.049,00:02:57.468,"I don't know. He's surly, and he's condescending."
00:02:58.344,00:03:01.514,"Well, if that's the case, then I think you need to hire some different people."
00:03:04.601,00:03:06.728,"Okay. Okay, I've been making a list, right?"
00:03:07.604,00:03:08.771,Taylor DeFranco.
00:03:10.481,00:03:12.817,"Okay, Tamatha Denise Feeny."
00:03:15.570,00:03:17.780,Tia Destiny Falkner.
00:03:18.364,00:03:20.867,"-These are not real people. -Um, Tour de France."
00:03:20.950,00:03:24.329,Stop. Are you sure that she did not leave it at Two Boots?
00:03:24.412,00:03:25.872,I checked the video slot.
00:03:25.955,00:03:27.415,Nothing. All right?
00:03:29.709,00:03:31.586,"-Ooh, give me your phone. -What are you doing?"
00:03:31.669,00:03:34.631,-I'm downloading the mommy app. -Not that app you're obsessed with. Stop.
00:03:34.714,00:03:37.508,"They'll find this girl. These women, they're like detectives."
00:03:37.592,00:03:38.760,They know everything.
00:03:39.802,00:03:42.639,I'll upload a photo and set you up for notifications.
00:03:42.722,00:03:43.598,You're welcome.
00:03:44.599,00:03:48.019,"Well, no, 'cause using the Internet, that's against the rules of the game."
00:03:48.102,00:03:51.814,"Dude, if she didn't leave the notebook, maybe… maybe she quit."
00:03:54.108,00:03:57.403,"I mean, not that I… I would know what she would do or what she's like."
00:04:02.283,00:04:06.120,"Ah, what the hell. Um, but I'm just gonna look up TDF."
00:04:06.204,00:04:12.835,"Okay, we got, Theater Development Fund. One of the oldest costume rental shops in New York, and they're in Queens."
00:04:12.919,00:04:15.505,"Okay, Operation Cinderella is on."
00:04:23.721,00:04:29.018,"According to our records, that boot was used in the original 1958 production of The Music Man."
00:04:29.102,00:04:30.061,How is that helpful?
00:04:30.144,00:04:35.024,Then it was loaned out to the LaGuardia High School for the Performing Arts but never returned.
00:04:35.108,00:04:36.276,"Okay, but that's more helpful."
00:04:36.359,00:04:40.738,"Well, it says here that someone did send some cash to pay for the missing boots."
00:04:40.822,00:04:45.243,"-Uh-huh. -A one, um, Lillian St. Clare DuBois."
00:04:47.203,00:04:50.039,"Well, that last name is obviously fake, but the cash was real."
00:04:50.123,00:04:52.834,"-Uh, is there a return address on there? -Hold on."
00:04:52.917,00:04:55.295,I thought you wanted to return the boot to the original owner.
00:04:55.378,00:04:56.212,Yeah.
00:04:56.296,00:04:58.172,"-Well, we're the original owner. -Wait, whoa."
00:04:58.256,00:04:59.882,Lily paid for it. It's hers.
00:04:59.966,00:05:02.510,"-Well, I'll see that she gets it. -No. I have to return this."
00:05:02.593,00:05:07.432,"Well, I have to wash a load of dirty pantaloons from the tour of Spamalot. Good day, sir."
00:05:07.515,00:05:08.933,Wait. This is not just about a boot.
00:05:09.017,00:05:18.067,"-It's not? -No, I… I… Look, you… you don't know me, but I'm like the Phantom."
00:05:18.151,00:05:19.902,His name is Eric.
00:05:19.986,00:05:26.492,"Right, no, Eric. And just like Eric, I… I… I, too, wear a mask."
00:05:28.161,00:05:31.289,"Not literally, but I… I don't let people get to know me."
00:05:31.372,00:05:39.756,"But, um, this girl, a girl I've only met through her words… she gets me."
00:05:40.256,00:05:41.424,Hmm.
00:05:41.507,00:05:47.930,"And last night, she was supposed to leave a message for me at a club, but all she left was this boot."
00:05:49.098,00:05:50.058,Like Cinderella.
00:05:50.141,00:05:54.354,Yeah. I can't lose her now. I'm not a crazy person. I promise.
00:05:54.437,00:06:03.571,I'm just a boy with a boot that's asking you to help me find… my Cinderella.
00:06:09.869,00:06:13.790,"Well, I am not one to stand in the way of true love."
00:06:20.338,00:06:23.591,"So, uh, did you really mean all that… all that stuff about love?"
00:06:23.674,00:06:26.928,"Huh? No, no. I was just saying that so she'd give me the address."
00:06:27.011,00:06:28.262,So what you gonna do now?
00:06:30.181,00:06:32.141,-We're going here. -We're gonna go to the address.
00:06:32.225,00:06:33.518,-Let's go. -Let's go find Lily.
00:06:50.451,00:06:53.204,You can stop pretending to be sick now. It's just me.
00:06:53.287,00:06:55.748,I'm not pretending. I am sick.
00:06:57.375,00:07:01.254,Why did I think it'd be romantic to sleep on a roof in December?
00:07:01.337,00:07:03.506,Why didn't you warn me that Grandpa was home?
00:07:03.589,00:07:05.633,"Okay, don't yell at me. My heart hurts."
00:07:05.716,00:07:08.719,Your heart? What's wrong with… Where's Benny?
00:07:11.013,00:07:13.641,"Well, he grounded me for life, so I need your help."
00:07:14.267,00:07:17.019,I sort of forgot to leave the notebook at the club.
00:07:17.103,00:07:18.396,"Look, Grandpa won't let me leave."
00:07:18.479,00:07:20.189,Can you please take this to Two Boots for me?
00:07:20.273,00:07:21.858,-It's 12 minutes if you run. -Run?
00:07:21.941,00:07:24.694,"There's this guy, Boomer. He'll know what to do."
00:07:24.777,00:07:26.446,"-Please, Langston. -I have a fever."
00:07:26.529,00:07:30.032,You don't have a fe-- You're burning up.
00:07:30.116,00:07:31.492,I told you.
00:07:32.243,00:07:35.163,"Wait, how could you forget that? Wasn't that the whole point of going?"
00:07:35.246,00:07:41.043,"I think the point was to rise up against my oppressors, but one of them showed up, this jerk, Edgar Thibaud."
00:07:41.127,00:07:44.046,"He ruined my life in middle school, and he picked up where he left off."
00:07:44.130,00:07:48.676,"Like, he's that same mean little boy, only now he's in the body of a hot guy."
00:07:52.180,00:07:54.974,I thought of all the bad things that could happen.
00:07:55.057,00:07:57.435,"And it was worse, so I ran."
00:07:57.518,00:08:01.898,"Wait, like… Yes. Only with more falling and crying."
00:08:09.906,00:08:13.117,"It's been fun, but I've got a lot going on right now."
00:08:18.581,00:08:23.628,"That way, I can leave with my dignity and, uh, stay the cool girl in his head."
00:08:23.711,00:08:24.921,No.
00:08:25.004,00:08:26.005,Come on.
00:08:26.088,00:08:29.425,"If you want to quit so bad, find a way to go to Two Boots yourself."
00:08:31.177,00:08:32.678,I'll bring you some ibuprofen.
00:08:32.762,00:08:35.306,And some licorice tea with lots of honey.
00:08:47.902,00:08:49.237,"Ring the bell, already."
00:08:53.616,00:08:54.450,Grandpa?
00:09:02.875,00:09:05.419,"Hey, kiddo. Where's your grandpa?"
00:09:05.503,00:09:07.505,I'm ready to beat him at cards.
00:09:07.588,00:09:10.925,Lily. What are you doing by the door? You're grounded.
00:09:11.008,00:09:13.886,"Langston, sick. Just gonna run out and get medicine."
00:09:13.970,00:09:15.429,Get away from the door.
00:09:15.513,00:09:18.474,"Hey, fellas, keep eyes on Lily today."
00:09:18.558,00:09:19.475,She's grounded.
00:09:20.059,00:09:21.769,She doesn't leave this apartment.
00:09:22.478,00:09:25.523,"Let me guess, he found out about the little creep boyfriend."
00:09:26.357,00:09:28.109,"Trust me, you're better off."
00:09:28.943,00:09:29.777,I know that now.
00:09:29.860,00:09:30.695,Ah.
00:09:45.876,00:09:50.298,"-Hey, maybe you could talk to her first. -Me? Why? I don't… I don't know her."
00:09:50.381,00:09:53.509,Why would I… why would I talk to her before you talk to her? That's not right.
00:09:53.593,00:09:56.470,"Maybe she doesn't want to see me, and you could tell her how sorry I am."
00:09:56.554,00:09:59.307,"You could be my Cyrano. Would you just do this, please?"
00:10:00.933,00:10:02.143,"All right, if you want me to."
00:10:04.270,00:10:08.024,"Wait, whoa, whoa. I gotta lea… I gotta go first."
00:10:08.107,00:10:08.941,Then go.
00:10:10.943,00:10:12.153,All right.
00:10:14.405,00:10:15.990,"Nope. Nope, nope, nope."
00:10:16.073,00:10:19.076,"Nope. I gotta… I gotta do this, and you've gotta go."
00:10:20.328,00:10:21.912,This is a Dash and Lily moment.
00:10:26.876,00:10:27.835,"Yeah, thanks."
00:10:47.647,00:10:50.274,Uh… You found my boot.
00:10:52.610,00:10:53.444,Lily?
00:10:54.612,00:10:55.821,"Born Lillian, yes."
00:10:58.074,00:11:00.117,Did you go to a punk show last night?
00:11:00.201,00:11:02.495,"Did I? No, not last night."
00:11:02.578,00:11:04.163,"Oh, Derek Jacobi's in town."
00:11:04.246,00:11:05.790,He hates punk music.
00:11:05.873,00:11:09.251,"Okay, I… Have you been writing to someone in a red notebook?"
00:11:12.213,00:11:14.256,Now I understand why you're here.
00:11:15.341,00:11:16.717,-Coffee? -Always.
00:11:23.974,00:11:24.809,"Come, come."
00:11:27.103,00:11:29.313,Uh… Whoa.
00:11:30.981,00:11:32.775,"Uh, so do you live here alone?"
00:11:32.858,00:11:35.945,"I live here, darling, but I'm rarely alone."
00:11:41.784,00:11:42.660,Sit.
00:11:53.796,00:11:55.881,Let me put your mind at ease.
00:12:00.010,00:12:01.011,Oh.
00:12:06.600,00:12:08.352,So who are you?
00:12:10.396,00:12:22.324,"Uh… Well, I'm Dash, and her and I have been, uh, writing to each other in this red notebook-- Which I gave to her, along with my red majorette boots."
00:12:22.908,00:12:25.494,You are looking for my great niece.
00:12:28.205,00:12:30.124,"Wait, you're Mrs. Basil E?"
00:12:31.250,00:12:33.127,Her nickname for me.
00:12:33.711,00:12:47.683,"I used to send Lily and her brother on scavenger hunts in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, like in the book From the Mixed-Up Files of-- Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. Yeah, I've read it. Um… Okay, great. Can I talk to her?"
00:12:49.018,00:12:51.270,-Are you in love with her? -What?
00:12:53.105,00:12:54.774,"No, I… I don't even know her."
00:12:55.733,00:12:58.736,"-Then I'm not very interested. -Wait, what? Whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:12:58.819,00:13:02.198,I'm not at all sure you're right for my Lily anyway.
00:13:03.657,00:13:05.618,-Do you believe in fairies? -No.
00:13:08.537,00:13:09.663,Love at first sight?
00:13:10.539,00:13:11.457,Musical theater?
00:13:11.540,00:13:14.126,I'm… I'm not really a guy that believes in things.
00:13:15.377,00:13:19.632,You believed you could find a girl with a boot.
00:13:19.715,00:13:21.550,Could you just tell me where she is?
00:13:21.634,00:13:25.012,"Her grandfather, my brother, will never let you see her."
00:13:25.095,00:13:26.847,He guards her like a jewel.
00:13:27.389,00:13:29.099,He won't even let me see her.
00:13:30.267,00:13:32.520,"Well, there was an incident with the Blue Man Group."
00:13:32.603,00:13:34.063,"Well, could you try, please?"
00:13:36.106,00:13:38.275,open up an old wound?
00:13:38.359,00:13:46.700,Go back to a place I am not welcome to deliver a message from someone Lily may not even wish to hear from in the first place.
00:13:46.784,00:13:52.873,"Okay, 'cause, look, last night, I had her do something that… it… it scared her, and I haven't talked to her since or heard from her since."
00:13:52.957,00:13:57.878,"And I don't know if she's hurt or something happened, and I'm just trying to make sure she's okay."
00:13:57.962,00:14:06.178,-Why? -Why? 'Cause I… Why? 'Cause I care about her.
00:14:09.265,00:14:10.891,That's more like it.
00:14:24.280,00:14:25.739,Mrs. Basil E.
00:14:26.282,00:14:27.992,Oh-ho-ho.
00:14:30.619,00:14:32.121,"Are you all right, my dear?"
00:14:32.204,00:14:34.957,"To be honest, um, a little rocky."
00:14:38.419,00:14:42.256,That's because you only have one boot.
00:14:43.048,00:14:43.966,How do you know?
00:14:44.717,00:14:46.886,A young man tracked it to me.
00:14:46.969,00:14:47.928,Notebook Boy?
00:14:48.012,00:14:53.100,Very impressive detective work. The work of someone who really cares.
00:14:53.183,00:14:54.727,He wouldn't if he'd seen me.
00:14:55.311,00:14:57.605,I was… a disaster.
00:14:57.688,00:14:58.731,It was embarrassing.
00:14:58.814,00:14:59.982,He's worried about you.
00:15:00.065,00:15:03.944,"He's worried about the girl in his head, and last night, I proved that I'm not her."
00:15:04.028,00:15:05.779,"I tried to be, but I blew it."
00:15:06.739,00:15:08.866,"If he knew, he wouldn't be looking for me."
00:15:12.244,00:15:15.915,"I had him keep the boot, just in case."
00:15:15.998,00:15:22.421,"After all, it's the prince who returns the shoe, not the fairy godmother."
00:15:22.504,00:15:26.759,"I can't. Even if I wanted to talk to him, I-- She's grounded."
00:15:28.344,00:15:29.178,Arthur.
00:15:31.722,00:15:33.015,Are we playing or what?
00:15:33.766,00:15:35.309,Game's over. Everybody out.
00:15:42.066,00:15:43.484,"Looking good, Lillian."
00:15:43.567,00:15:44.735,"You too, Sal."
00:15:52.201,00:15:53.577,I said everybody.
00:15:53.661,00:15:55.245,Why is Lily grounded?
00:15:55.329,00:16:03.003,You gave up your right to weigh in on family matters when you abandoned the family-- Going on tour with the Rolling Stones is not abandoning the family.
00:16:03.087,00:16:05.589,"You are irresponsible, a bad influence."
00:16:05.673,00:16:07.925,Because I took Lily to an off-Broadway show?
00:16:08.008,00:16:10.052,Your flew her to Las Vegas.
00:16:10.135,00:16:12.054,Which is not on Broadway.
00:16:12.846,00:16:14.598,Please leave.
00:16:14.682,00:16:17.851,"I am Lily's godmother, and I will have my say."
00:16:20.104,00:16:20.938,Fine.
00:16:22.398,00:16:23.774,You can wait in your room.
00:16:44.294,00:16:54.680,"At least you got to go to a club for once in your life, before, you know, it's over forever, because they're never letting you leave the house again."
00:16:58.892,00:16:59.727,That's it.
00:17:02.688,00:17:03.522,That's it.
00:17:03.605,00:17:10.571,"This is my life, and I sh-- What did you say to him?"
00:17:10.654,00:17:13.657,You and your grandfather need to have a conversation.
00:17:13.741,00:17:17.661,Grandpa? I'm sorry. I will never leave the house again.
00:17:21.957,00:17:24.585,"I hope to see you again soon, Arthur."
00:17:27.046,00:17:29.089,-You're going home? -You can handle this.
00:17:29.173,00:17:31.425,"No, I won't. I can't. He's crying."
00:17:32.092,00:17:37.306,"Argue for your limitations, and they are surely yours."
00:17:37.931,00:17:39.058,What does that mean?
00:17:42.436,00:18:01.038,"Uh, s… seriously, what does that… I proposed to Mabel."
00:18:02.498,00:18:03.499,She turned me down.
00:18:04.333,00:18:05.334,That's why I'm home.
00:18:06.794,00:18:07.920,I'm so sorry.
00:18:09.463,00:18:12.633,You two seemed so… happy.
00:18:13.217,00:18:14.384,Did she say why?
00:18:15.094,00:18:16.970,She doesn't want to move to New York.
00:18:17.054,00:18:18.222,"Well, duh."
00:18:20.808,00:18:24.603,"You always go to see her because the weather's nice, and she has the pool."
00:18:26.563,00:18:27.898,I live in New York.
00:18:27.981,00:18:29.900,-Family lives in New York. -I know.
00:18:32.778,00:18:34.238,Why did you propose to her?
00:18:35.072,00:18:37.449,"I mean, do… do you love Mabel?"
00:18:40.619,00:18:44.665,She makes me feel… less lonely.
00:18:45.332,00:18:46.917,I know what that feels like.
00:18:48.335,00:18:49.419,It's nice.
00:18:55.092,00:18:57.761,-Do you like Florida? -It's very pleasant.
00:18:59.429,00:19:00.556,Produce is excellent.
00:19:04.726,00:19:09.648,"There are worse things than sitting at a pool, feeling less lonely."
00:19:14.027,00:19:14.862,I'll think about it.
00:19:16.530,00:19:22.411,"I came home so I wouldn't be alone on Christmas, and I found a naked boy in Langston's room and you out all night."
00:19:24.997,00:19:26.331,I was too harsh.
00:19:30.586,00:19:31.712,I overreacted.
00:19:33.005,00:19:36.008,You're still grounded for the rest of today but not forever.
00:19:37.426,00:19:43.891,And… I would like to take you out for ice cream… to apologize.
00:19:46.185,00:19:49.855,Actually… you know what I would really like?
00:19:52.941,00:19:54.776,-I'll order for both of us. -No mushrooms.
00:19:54.860,00:19:55.694,Understood.
00:20:00.365,00:20:02.826,"-Sorry. -Oh, my… oh, my God, it's you."
00:20:02.910,00:20:03.911,"Yeah, yeah. Keep it down."
00:20:03.994,00:20:06.246,We've been looking all over the place for you.
00:20:06.330,00:20:09.750,"I know. I'm sorry. I got freaked out, and I ran."
00:20:09.833,00:20:12.002,"-And I-- -Hey. Hey, you gonna order or what?"
00:20:14.588,00:20:15.797,"You deliver, right?"
00:20:16.381,00:20:18.717,"Well, I'm… I'm on counter duty right now."
00:20:18.800,00:20:20.260,This is time-sensitive.
00:20:20.761,00:20:23.597,The order has to be placed by 5:00 p.m.
00:20:23.680,00:20:24.640,Can you do that?
00:20:30.896,00:20:32.606,"Hey, hey, hey, where you going?"
00:20:33.857,00:20:35.108,"He's coming back, right?"
00:20:50.249,00:20:51.583,Five… five p.m.
00:20:52.084,00:20:53.710,Five p.m. Take the Q train.
00:20:53.794,00:20:55.921,-Where'd you find this? -Two Boots video slot.
00:20:56.004,00:20:57.130,"-Well, uh… -Come on."
00:20:57.214,00:20:59.258,"-Come on, go, go, go. -Wait, wait, wait."
00:20:59.341,00:21:01.551,"Come on, you have to go right now. Right now."
00:21:06.682,00:21:12.896,"When I first got to that club, I was so worried about what people were thinking about me that all I could see was the bad stuff."
00:21:14.564,00:21:18.026,I don't do well with bad stuff or bad feelings.
00:21:18.110,00:21:21.446,"I always tell myself, When there's rain, look for the rainbow."
00:21:22.823,00:21:26.326,"But I couldn't find one, so I ran."
00:21:28.662,00:21:29.997,Then I saw your message.
00:21:30.872,00:21:34.751,Something about knowing that you knew how I felt made it okay to go back out there.
00:21:36.336,00:21:38.672,"And this time, I saw the good."
00:21:39.631,00:21:40.841,People having fun.
00:21:41.508,00:21:43.677,I could join them or stay in my shell.
00:21:50.517,00:21:52.060,I want to do the same for you.
00:21:53.353,00:21:54.521,Go to Dyker Heights.
00:21:55.605,00:21:58.859,Start at the Nutcracker house. You'll know it when you see it.
00:22:03.739,00:22:04.573,Are you there?
00:22:05.115,00:22:06.908,"I am here, Lily."
00:22:15.667,00:22:18.879,"fake Santas, and nothing that's real."
00:22:29.973,00:22:35.562,an older couple who probably come here every year to take a picture in front of the same house.
00:22:37.439,00:22:40.650,Probably have years of those photographs framed on their wall.
00:22:42.694,00:22:44.112,I see them holding hands.
00:22:46.323,00:22:48.742,And I think how they must know each other very well.
00:22:58.168,00:23:00.420,that one day something would magically change.
00:23:02.381,00:23:12.474,"But, little-known fact, the word abracadabra comes from an Arabic phrase, avra kadabra, meaning, I create as I speak."
00:23:17.187,00:23:18.772,We make our own magic.
00:23:22.192,00:23:25.779,"This notebook is magic, and we see what we look for."
00:23:27.447,00:23:29.699,I hope you'll keep looking for the good stuff.
00:23:30.784,00:23:35.956,"But, to help you out, be at the last house on the block when the clock strikes five."
00:23:37.749,00:23:38.917,I'll send you a sign.
00:23:47.426,00:23:49.177,"I believe in you, Notebook Boy."
00:23:51.346,00:23:52.722,Do you still believe in me?
00:00:10.802,00:00:12.554,So my ex-girlfriend is in town.
00:00:16.725,00:00:25.358,"She's back for the holidays, and… she texted me she wants to see me. I… I don't know what to do."
00:00:28.528,00:00:33.491,"She broke my heart, and I feel like I was… finally moving on."
00:00:33.575,00:00:39.122,"I mean, due in large part to the person who actually brought me here today, so I don't know."
00:00:41.166,00:00:43.043,"Well, what do you guys think I should do?"
00:00:44.335,00:00:45.170,Yeah.
00:00:45.837,00:00:46.963,I appreciate the help.
00:00:58.349,00:01:00.518,When you can't rely on language to give you an answer.
00:01:01.352,00:01:05.190,Like when you're trying to make mochi in a kitchen full of Japanese grannies.
00:01:05.690,00:01:06.983,You could ask for help.
00:01:07.067,00:01:08.318,Never!
00:01:09.903,00:01:10.904,Sorry.
00:01:20.872,00:01:24.042,An artsy pop-up that I know you're gonna love.
00:01:29.839,00:01:31.633,The goal of our pop-up?
00:01:32.383,00:01:33.343,To create.
00:01:34.302,00:01:40.475,To build… a manifestation of what's been occupying your mental space.
00:01:44.729,00:01:46.856,These dares are supposed to be challenging.
00:01:55.990,00:01:57.492,I'm a hundred percent focused.
00:02:06.668,00:02:09.045,Well… maybe not a hundred percent.
00:02:09.129,00:02:10.839,Make whatever's in your head.
00:02:10.922,00:02:12.257,Express yourself.
00:02:13.007,00:02:13.842,Be free.
00:02:24.060,00:02:24.894,Perfect.
00:02:35.488,00:02:37.991,you need to listen to your mochi.
00:02:38.074,00:02:40.243,Listen to my mochi?
00:02:43.371,00:02:49.961,"on how things should be, but if your mind is quiet, sometimes the best answer to a problem makes itself heard."
00:02:51.045,00:02:53.882,"I guess this is me saying, Go with the flow."
00:02:56.843,00:02:59.137,But that's exactly why I sent you here.
00:02:59.220,00:03:00.305,Give it a try.
00:03:00.388,00:03:02.515,Listen to your mochi.
00:03:05.018,00:03:06.352,Listen to my mochi.
00:03:39.010,00:03:43.765,"I was hoping for something equally challenging, but you seem to have misjudged me."
00:03:44.891,00:03:53.024,This stack of Coke cans represents how corporatized reality television ideology has become the steel grip on the American throat.
00:03:55.526,00:03:56.527,I made a Muppet.
00:03:57.320,00:04:00.240,It's what I think a friend of mine looks like in real life.
00:04:01.741,00:04:03.201,He looks rude.
00:04:07.830,00:04:10.166,"Thanks for a fun challenge, Snarl."
00:04:10.250,00:04:11.209,Am I done now?
00:04:15.046,00:04:20.969,"All right. Now that we've created, -it's time to destroy. -Wait. What?"
00:04:21.052,00:04:25.265,It's time to free your mind of the corporeal baggage you've materialized here.
00:04:26.015,00:04:27.267,What's happening now?
00:04:27.350,00:04:29.894,-This is the Break Room. -Right. Break Room.
00:04:29.978,00:04:32.814,"Where we all take a fun, creative craft break as a group."
00:04:33.398,00:04:37.735,"No. Break Room, where you literally break shit to feel better."
00:04:45.576,00:04:47.745,"But sometimes, a rainbow doesn't show."
00:04:47.829,00:04:49.122,So what do you do?
00:04:49.205,00:04:51.833,You stand in the rain and scream.
00:05:06.180,00:05:11.394,"Instead of hiding behind a smile, release your negative emotions. Beat the crap out of something."
00:05:11.894,00:05:14.147,I guarantee you will feel amazing.
00:05:14.230,00:05:15.398,These should work well.
00:05:31.414,00:05:33.499,I'm actually feeling pretty relaxed today.
00:05:34.459,00:05:36.586,Your friend's a really talented artist.
00:05:37.086,00:05:38.963,First Muppet we've had here.
00:05:39.464,00:05:41.924,"Ooh, fantastic. Where's the corpse?"
00:05:52.060,00:05:54.562,Okay. Protein cup for Peanut.
00:05:54.645,00:05:59.984,"Hey, no. Grain-free for Boris, and only one at a time for your digestive system, okay?"
00:06:00.735,00:06:03.654,"Oh, my God! Hank, I love your pink jacket."
00:06:03.738,00:06:05.114,"Come here, Hank. Come here."
00:06:05.198,00:06:07.075,Good Hank. Good Hank.
00:06:13.414,00:06:15.291,Lily Mori-Novak.
00:06:16.501,00:06:17.335,Edgar!
00:06:20.171,00:06:23.091,What are you doing here? Are… are you stalking me?
00:06:23.674,00:06:25.385,"No. You wouldn't do that, I think."
00:06:25.468,00:06:29.514,"I mean, I don't actually know you that well-- I looked you up on Instagram after the show."
00:06:30.723,00:06:36.604,"You only post dog photos tagged at this park at 3:00 p.m., so I've been coming here every day at three hoping to run into you."
00:06:36.687,00:06:38.439,That is the literal definition of stalking.
00:06:38.523,00:06:40.358,"You know, I assumed you'd have a dog yourself."
00:06:40.441,00:06:42.235,It's kind of weird that you don't.
00:06:42.318,00:06:44.904,Do you just buy treats for other people's dogs?
00:06:48.533,00:06:50.535,That is so weird.
00:06:50.618,00:06:52.078,So weird.
00:06:54.205,00:06:56.707,"Wait, is that why you came here? To tell me how weird I am?"
00:06:56.791,00:06:59.419,'Cause I got it. Weirdo-Central. Catch ya later.
00:06:59.502,00:07:00.503,"No, no, wait. No."
00:07:00.586,00:07:04.132,I… I felt… I felt bad about how things went down at the show.
00:07:04.215,00:07:10.555,"Oh, yes. The punk show, where you maybe sort of told me I looked like a freak, which I probably did, so it's totally fine."
00:07:10.638,00:07:12.348,"No, that was a compliment."
00:07:12.432,00:07:13.891,"-A compliment? -Yes, man."
00:07:13.975,00:07:15.685,Your… your dancing was awesome.
00:07:15.768,00:07:18.563,"You've always been able to let go like that, even as a kid."
00:07:18.646,00:07:20.481,It always made me so jealous.
00:07:21.315,00:07:22.608,You were jealous of me?
00:07:23.109,00:07:24.277,I still am.
00:07:25.778,00:07:28.823,And now look at you. You've grown up so damn cute.
00:07:28.906,00:07:31.451,You've even got the puppet and everything.
00:07:34.912,00:07:37.039,Do you remember the last time you talked to me?
00:07:39.292,00:07:41.335,"Well, it had to be before seventh grade."
00:07:41.419,00:07:45.131,That's when I set that fire and my dad sent me away to boarding school.
00:07:46.090,00:07:47.258,Why? Do you remember?
00:07:53.139,00:07:53.973,No.
00:07:54.474,00:07:56.100,"Hey, what are you doing later?"
00:07:56.184,00:07:58.728,There's this slam poetry night around the corner.
00:07:59.312,00:08:02.315,A bunch of East Village artists sticking it to the bourgeoisie.
00:08:02.398,00:08:03.232,You should come.
00:08:05.776,00:08:07.528,I'm trying on my free spirit hat.
00:08:08.070,00:08:08.905,Like yours.
00:08:09.405,00:08:13.576,"It's harder for some of us when it doesn't come naturally, but I'm trying."
00:08:14.660,00:08:17.580,"You're the real deal, Lily. You always have been."
00:08:18.456,00:08:22.335,So get used to it because… other people notice.
00:08:45.650,00:08:51.113,"But that's okay, because this notebook is the perfect vessel to release any emotions, good or bad."
00:09:21.352,00:09:22.270,Dad?
00:09:22.353,00:09:25.648,"Jesus, Dash. What… what the hell are you doing here?"
00:09:26.232,00:09:27.817,What the hell are you doing here?
00:09:29.193,00:09:31.654,Hi. I'm Leeza. Nice to meet you.
00:09:42.373,00:09:46.002,"-So I was thinking-- -So-- -Um… -No, go ahead."
00:09:46.502,00:09:50.131,"Well, no, I was just gonna say, I thought you were gonna be in the Alps till New Year's."
00:09:50.214,00:09:52.216,"Yeah, we got our fill of Switzerland pretty fast."
00:09:52.300,00:09:58.723,"Now we're headed over to Half Moon Bay to sail, but Leeza wanted to stop by real quick to do breakfast at Tiffany's."
00:10:01.058,00:10:03.144,What is it with women and Audrey Hepburn?
00:10:05.271,00:10:07.398,So you weren't gonna tell me you were here.
00:10:08.774,00:10:10.860,Weren't you supposed to be at your mom's?
00:10:10.943,00:10:16.449,"Well, yeah, I… I am. I just… I needed a break, so I'm just hanging here. Hanging out."
00:10:16.991,00:10:19.785,You don't have to tell me twice. Your mother's a pill.
00:10:21.412,00:10:23.497,Why don't we grab dinner tonight?
00:10:23.581,00:10:24.624,"You, me, Leeza."
00:10:25.333,00:10:27.418,Second chance for a first impression.
00:10:28.169,00:10:30.588,-Great. -I'll let you put on some decent clothes.
00:10:36.552,00:10:39.263,-Yeah? -The only thing in the fridge was mochi.
00:10:39.347,00:10:47.146,"Oh, no, no, no. Dad-- Hey, great news! Kid's gonna join us for dinner!"
00:10:58.616,00:11:01.285,"So my dad is in town, a true Christmas nightmare."
00:11:01.911,00:11:04.664,"To make it worse, I'm being strong-armed into dinner."
00:11:19.428,00:11:44.537,"The only thing that's ever helped me in these eternally fraught dinners was Sofia… my ex-girlfriend, who would effortlessly defuse the tension in any room because that's the type of person she is-- Nope. No. I can't do that. Um… Well, Lily, seems we've run into a problem."
00:11:44.620,00:11:48.124,"I can't tell the girl I like everything, now, can I?"
00:11:49.709,00:11:53.003,Like how I really wanna meet you and think about you all the time.
00:11:53.504,00:11:54.755,Yeah. No. Definitely not.
00:11:56.173,00:12:10.187,"Definitely not. Definitely not. Um… Hey, are you free for dinner tonight?"
00:12:17.153,00:12:18.154,What's the big deal?
00:12:42.136,00:12:43.345,I'm so sorry.
00:12:43.429,00:12:44.305,I heard.
00:12:45.222,00:12:47.975,Did you and Benny just-- Break up? Yeah.
00:12:48.768,00:12:51.771,"-Because of, uh, Puerto Rico? -He's leaving me, Lily."
00:12:52.480,00:13:00.029,"Okay, out of sight, out of mind has burned me in the past, Are you okay?"
00:13:01.405,00:13:02.239,Obviously not.
00:13:03.157,00:13:05.242,"Well, long distance isn't so bad."
00:13:05.326,00:13:07.828,"Yeah, how do you know? You've never even dated anyone."
00:13:08.537,00:13:09.789,Notebook Boy.
00:13:12.583,00:13:13.876,That's a pen pal.
00:13:13.959,00:13:16.545,You can still mail him your notebook from Fiji.
00:13:16.629,00:13:19.048,Why would I mail him my notebook from Fiji?
00:13:20.591,00:13:21.425,Langston?
00:13:22.468,00:13:24.637,"Langston, why would I mail him the notebook from Fiji?"
00:13:29.517,00:13:30.351,"Wake up, Lily!"
00:13:30.434,00:13:32.978,They're in Fiji because dad is up for a job there.
00:13:33.062,00:13:35.314,"-What? -If he gets it, you're going with them."
00:13:35.397,00:13:37.441,"I get to stay because I'm an adult, legally."
00:13:37.525,00:13:39.276,"Well, what if I don't wanna go to Fiji?"
00:13:39.360,00:13:43.155,"What does it matter? You spend all your time with Mom, Dad, and Grandpa anyway."
00:13:43.239,00:13:46.283,And the reason we didn't tell you is because we knew you would freak out.
00:13:47.326,00:13:48.911,You all lied to me?
00:13:48.994,00:13:51.330,I guess we're both having a shitty Christmas.
00:14:04.510,00:14:06.011,"Um, so, Leeza, what do you do?"
00:14:06.637,00:14:08.347,I'm a microbiologist.
00:14:09.098,00:14:11.934,-Lovely. -Do you like microbiology?
00:14:13.978,00:14:14.812,No.
00:14:17.439,00:14:19.859,"Excuse me, waiter, could I get a seltzer, please?"
00:14:21.735,00:14:23.654,"Lime would be great, thank you."
00:14:25.656,00:14:26.532,So you also ski?
00:14:26.615,00:14:28.242,-Mmm. -Yep.
00:14:31.871,00:14:33.873,Dash never had a taste for the sporting life.
00:14:33.956,00:14:35.624,Couldn't get him to touch a ball if I tried.
00:14:36.375,00:14:38.544,"Well, why do you want me touching balls so badly?"
00:14:38.627,00:14:41.714,Kid's a smart aleck. Thinks he's some kind of Sigmund Freud.
00:15:00.691,00:15:04.153,"-Always a pleasure to see you, Sofia. -Gordon. It's been too long."
00:15:04.653,00:15:07.406,And you must be Leeza. Dash has told me all about you.
00:15:08.407,00:15:09.617,It's lovely to meet you.
00:15:13.662,00:15:14.496,"Hi, again."
00:15:14.997,00:15:15.873,"Hi, again."
00:15:17.416,00:15:21.086,"I, uh, found the closest exit, so tug your ear, and we're out of here."
00:15:22.838,00:15:26.175,"So you're back in town, and you're still giving my son the time of day."
00:15:26.258,00:15:27.509,"Really, it's the opposite."
00:15:27.593,00:15:30.095,I should thank Dash for making time for me.
00:15:30.179,00:15:31.263,He's quite in demand.
00:15:31.347,00:15:33.474,It's kind of hard to get a moment with him.
00:15:33.557,00:15:35.976,So thank you for calling me back.
00:15:36.060,00:15:38.395,"-I just got back from Bolzano. -Ooh, Bolzano!"
00:15:38.479,00:15:43.525,"See? That's the thing. I've always wanted to travel with Dash, but he'd rather have his nose stuck in some book."
00:15:44.276,00:15:45.235,"Why is that, Dash?"
00:15:52.076,00:15:55.204,Because you'd always travel with one of your girlfriends that I didn't know.
00:15:55.287,00:15:57.414,Because you cared about them more than me.
00:15:58.040,00:15:59.833,"Which one should I say first, Dad?"
00:16:00.751,00:16:03.045,What? Are you gonna fight me on this one too?
00:16:07.049,00:16:08.300,Listen to my mochi.
00:16:08.926,00:16:09.927,I'm sorry. What was that?
00:16:16.433,00:16:18.477,but only if your mind is quiet.
00:16:26.318,00:16:27.152,All right.
00:16:28.404,00:16:32.741,"Well, I was just thinking how you used to take me to that bookstore by our old place. Do you remember?"
00:16:33.701,00:16:34.576,On 81st.
00:16:38.455,00:16:40.165,"Yeah, I used to take you there after T-ball."
00:16:40.249,00:16:43.544,You hated those games. Taking you there was the only way I could get you to play.
00:16:44.128,00:16:45.879,"Well, I loved going there with you."
00:16:47.756,00:16:50.092,It was probably where I first fell in love with books.
00:16:50.676,00:16:51.719,Really?
00:16:54.930,00:16:57.099,You'd love this bookstore we found on the Amalfi Coast.
00:16:59.351,00:17:01.979,Gordon could barely fit inside. I'm not kidding.
00:17:19.204,00:17:20.706,"Hi, is Boomer there yet?"
00:17:22.624,00:17:25.919,"Oh, okay! Well, um, can you tell me if there's a red notebook?"
00:17:27.463,00:17:28.297,Why?
00:17:29.214,00:17:32.718,"Because I'm very upset, and I need a place to write down my feelings."
00:17:34.094,00:17:39.349,"No, I don't wanna order a pizza, I-- Hello?"
00:18:26.021,00:18:27.940,Keep it going for your last poet!
00:18:34.404,00:18:41.912,"Okay, okay. Our next up is-- Uh, her, apparently."
00:18:42.579,00:18:46.125,"Sorry. You know, I'm just kind of on a roll right now. You know?"
00:18:47.167,00:18:49.169,Edgar. Are you here?
00:18:49.753,00:18:51.463,"Uh, Edgar?"
00:18:54.383,00:18:55.467,Okay.
00:18:57.386,00:19:05.018,"Well… I just beat the crap out of something, and it felt amazing."
00:19:07.271,00:19:08.147,Thank you.
00:19:08.897,00:19:13.443,"Thank you. Yeah, 'cause, you know, it's okay to say that things suck."
00:19:13.527,00:19:16.238,"Like… like… like my family, right now, they suck."
00:19:16.321,00:19:21.660,"And, uh, these wall sconces. Sorry, but, uh, suckfest on ice!"
00:19:23.662,00:19:25.664,Because I'm not holding back.
00:19:25.747,00:19:26.874,Not after Fiji!
00:19:28.792,00:19:32.546,"Here's the truth, I'm not happy and positive all the time."
00:19:32.629,00:19:40.429,"In fact, I usually feel small and like an outsider… because of, um… him!"
00:19:42.639,00:19:43.515,There he is.
00:19:44.558,00:19:46.643,My middle-school bully in the flesh.
00:19:49.396,00:19:53.609,That night at the middle-school dance when you got that bracelet you're wearing?
00:19:54.151,00:19:56.069,That night changed everything for me.
00:19:56.695,00:20:01.909,"Because of you, I stayed home every time I had the chance to go out and make friends."
00:20:02.659,00:20:05.495,I don't go to parties. I run away from clubs.
00:20:06.205,00:20:14.463,"You kept me from wanting to go out and… and put myself out there, and you stopped me from doing all the things that I wanted to do for so long."
00:20:16.465,00:20:20.761,And the worst part is… you don't even remember.
00:20:24.514,00:20:25.641,Maybe he liked you!
00:20:25.724,00:20:26.725,No!
00:20:27.351,00:20:32.105,No! I'm tired of boys pulling our pigtails and getting called cute!
00:20:36.443,00:20:40.572,I'm mad at you! I'm mad at my mom! I'm mad at Langston and myself!
00:20:41.949,00:20:42.866,But you?
00:20:43.408,00:20:46.870,"You don't get to have that power over me anymore, Edgar."
00:20:47.454,00:20:48.288,You don't.
00:20:49.873,00:20:54.836,I wish I could have gone up to you that day after the dance and told you how upset you made me.
00:20:55.587,00:20:58.465,And gotten it out of my system and lived a normal life.
00:20:59.383,00:21:05.097,"I wish I could have stood up to all the bullies who made me feel too weird, too different, too Asian."
00:21:06.515,00:21:07.432,But you know what?
00:21:09.017,00:21:10.519,I was only 12 years old.
00:21:13.480,00:21:14.439,So was I.
00:21:16.608,00:21:18.735,I had no idea that I did any of that.
00:21:19.236,00:21:21.697,"I… I'm such a dumbass. I'm so sorry, Lily."
00:21:27.286,00:21:33.667,"I… I wish I could go back, but I… Can I make it up to you?"
00:21:35.460,00:21:36.295,How?
00:21:36.378,00:21:40.340,You wanna go to a Christmas Eve party with me tomorrow night?
00:21:42.301,00:21:43.844,I… I can introduce you.
00:21:45.178,00:21:46.805,I'm really good with parties.
00:21:54.396,00:21:55.314,Okay.
00:22:11.330,00:22:13.165,I am really happy you came.
00:22:15.459,00:22:18.503,"Hey, when I get back, maybe we could stop by that bookstore?"
00:22:19.212,00:22:20.130,-Sure. -Yeah?
00:22:20.213,00:22:21.089,"Yeah, sure."
00:22:21.173,00:22:23.216,"Hey, I'm glad you and Sofia got back together."
00:22:25.594,00:22:28.805,"I may not know much, but I know women."
00:22:32.100,00:22:33.018,All right.
00:22:36.688,00:22:38.899,"Um, excuse me? Who was that in there?"
00:22:43.445,00:22:47.449,Thanks for coming tonight. I know it probably wasn't what you meant when you asked to hang out.
00:22:47.532,00:22:49.743,"No, I'm glad you reached out. It was good to see you."
00:22:49.826,00:22:50.660,"You, too."
00:22:51.161,00:22:55.665,"Uh, the reason I wanted to talk to you is because… I'm moving back."
00:22:56.708,00:22:57.542,To New York.
00:22:58.502,00:22:59.336,"Oh, wow."
00:22:59.419,00:23:01.755,And I wanted to make sure that we were okay.
00:23:04.174,00:23:05.425,Maybe even friends again?
00:23:06.426,00:23:09.012,I… Yeah. Friends sounds good.
00:23:11.098,00:23:16.770,"Hey, uh, some people from school are hanging out if you're not too socially exhausted."
00:23:16.853,00:23:17.687,You want to go?
00:23:18.480,00:23:21.233,"Um… well, is Priya gonna be there?"
00:23:29.282,00:23:34.913,"But if you can do it, Notebook Boy, then I promise to try. I hope you write back soon."
00:23:37.958,00:23:40.293,Back from Sweden and out past 11.
00:23:40.377,00:23:41.586,"-Hi. -Hi, Priya."
00:23:43.463,00:23:44.840,I must be seeing things.
00:23:44.923,00:23:48.135,"Mmm. Well, the Christmas lights make you look especially calculating."
00:23:48.218,00:23:49.219,Hmm.
00:23:52.264,00:23:54.182,Glad to see nothing's changed here.
00:23:56.643,00:23:58.562,Dash! Dash!
00:23:58.645,00:24:00.230,"Hey, Thibaud."
00:24:00.313,00:24:04.401,"Oh, you… you'd really like this. I just got back from a poetry reading."
00:24:05.444,00:24:09.489,"I mean, no institution is immune to poetic justice. Am I right?"
00:24:09.573,00:24:11.908,"Wow, it's a whole new Thibaud."
00:24:12.409,00:24:15.495,"Yeah, you know, I actually had kind of a breakthrough tonight."
00:24:16.872,00:24:17.831,"Me, too."
00:24:17.914,00:24:20.041,"Hey, are you going to Priya's party tomorrow night?"
00:24:20.125,00:24:27.716,"Yeah, Dashiell. Are you coming to my undoubtably delightful Christmas Eve party, which many would trade their very souls to attend?"
00:24:27.799,00:24:29.801,I'm going. Bringing a girl.
00:24:33.180,00:24:34.014,Congratulations.
00:24:34.097,00:24:34.973,Yo!
00:24:35.056,00:24:39.436,"You don't have to, but… maybe we can go together."
00:24:40.437,00:24:41.271,As friends?
00:24:46.234,00:24:47.110,go with the flow.
00:24:49.237,00:24:50.071,"Sure, I'll go."
00:24:51.364,00:24:52.199,Why not?
00:00:14.180,00:00:17.976,"who's in town for the holidays, and we have a complicated history."
00:00:18.059,00:00:20.562,There is no way I'm throwing away my peacoat.
00:00:25.150,00:00:28.611,"I know, but my… my peacoat is like Hagrid's jacket. It's magical."
00:00:28.695,00:00:31.531,I love how I can just… I reach into my pockets.
00:00:31.614,00:00:33.199,Never know what I'm gonna find.
00:00:34.701,00:00:35.910,"-Oh, moldy muffin. -Ugh."
00:00:37.704,00:00:45.462,"As your friend and potential wing woman, I highly recommend you let me style you if you're looking to meet someone tonight."
00:00:50.216,00:00:52.177,How do you sort of meet someone?
00:01:07.275,00:01:08.610,That's just wrong.
00:01:10.195,00:01:13.073,"Lily is, um, unique. I'm into it."
00:01:13.948,00:01:17.202,"So, this is why you made me come all the way to Gowanus for pie."
00:01:17.285,00:01:18.703,"Well, it's… it's how the game works."
00:01:18.787,00:01:21.664,I have to do the dare and then report back.
00:01:22.916,00:01:24.793,So… All right.
00:01:30.840,00:01:31.800,Mmm.
00:01:33.802,00:01:35.261,"Sofia, you should try some of this."
00:01:36.679,00:01:38.306,"I really think it's-- Honestly, it's good."
00:01:39.307,00:01:40.517,"I'm happy for you, Dash."
00:01:41.434,00:01:43.686,You finally found that perfect girl in your head.
00:01:45.939,00:01:47.107,What is that supposed to mean?
00:01:48.900,00:01:54.155,"you carry around this ideal girl in your head, and every girl you're with gets measured up against that girl."
00:01:54.239,00:01:57.784,"So, this notebook game is a great idea."
00:01:57.867,00:02:03.706,"I mean, if you never meet Lily, she can just be that perfect girl in your head forever."
00:02:03.790,00:02:05.416,"No, no, no. We're gonna meet eventually."
00:02:05.500,00:02:08.044,We just want to get to know each other first.
00:02:08.128,00:02:11.631,"I think it's super romantic, but I want to caution you."
00:02:12.215,00:02:14.968,"When you put girls on pedestals, they fall."
00:02:15.552,00:02:18.346,"Now, hurry up, and let's go to Bergdorf's."
00:02:26.771,00:02:29.774,You've given me a Christmas break that doesn't totally suck.
00:02:30.400,00:02:35.363,"In the spirit of reciprocity, my Christmas gift to you will be my name."
00:02:40.326,00:02:44.205,"So, this Notebook Guy is the one who got you to go to the club."
00:02:44.914,00:02:47.625,"He seems cool, if you're into guys."
00:02:51.421,00:02:52.505,"I'm so sorry, Lily."
00:02:52.589,00:02:53.506,It's okay.
00:02:53.590,00:02:55.925,"It's not definite yet, so I'm trying to stay positive."
00:02:58.887,00:03:00.930,"So if anyone can do it, it's you."
00:03:01.431,00:03:03.141,"Besides, it's win-win."
00:03:03.224,00:03:05.226,You'd be literally moving to paradise.
00:03:05.852,00:03:07.020,New York is overrated.
00:03:07.103,00:03:09.647,Just finish any unfinished business and escape.
00:03:10.857,00:03:14.319,"Okay, so this place puts cheese on pies?"
00:03:15.028,00:03:16.821,That is an unholy violation.
00:03:17.363,00:03:18.740,I kind of like it.
00:03:28.833,00:03:30.376,I'm happy I could help.
00:03:31.544,00:03:35.089,It feels like so many things in my life are up in the air right now.
00:03:36.090,00:03:37.008,But not you.
00:03:38.259,00:03:40.887,You've helped me feel better about facing the future.
00:04:08.581,00:04:09.791,What are you staring at?
00:04:10.625,00:04:13.294,It's not my fault another boy asked me out before you.
00:04:17.590,00:04:18.758,Up for some Catan?
00:04:19.300,00:04:20.510,Christmas Eve tradition.
00:04:20.593,00:04:22.095,I don't play Catan with liars.
00:04:22.178,00:04:25.598,"You know, for the record, I didn't lie about Fiji. I withheld."
00:04:26.349,00:04:27.433,There's a difference.
00:04:30.979,00:04:33.773,"I'm sorry that I lashed out, okay?"
00:04:37.819,00:04:40.989,And that was dumb because you are my rock.
00:04:42.949,00:04:47.287,I could really use your help to get my mind off the fact that #love is officially dead.
00:04:47.370,00:04:53.876,"Look, even if I wasn't really mad at you right now, I can't because I have a date tonight, so… Wait, with Notebook Boy?"
00:04:55.670,00:04:58.131,"It's actually with, um, another boy."
00:04:59.257,00:05:02.260,-You didn't tell me you met someone else. -I withheld.
00:05:03.469,00:05:05.680,"Actually, I could really use your advice on how to cancel."
00:05:05.763,00:05:10.310,"Cancel? Why would you cancel? My advice is never cancel a date, ever."
00:05:10.935,00:05:14.397,But aren't I betraying Notebook Boy by going out with someone else?
00:05:14.480,00:05:16.441,You're keeping your options open. That's healthy.
00:05:16.524,00:05:19.193,What if I don't want to keep my options open?
00:05:19.277,00:05:21.195,I like Notebook Boy.
00:05:21.279,00:05:25.450,I like him too. I like him most because he encourages you to get out of your bubble.
00:05:25.533,00:05:26.784,This is a real boy.
00:05:27.827,00:05:28.995,"It is, right?"
00:05:29.996,00:05:31.873,This is a real boy? This isn't another Muppet?
00:05:32.457,00:05:34.459,-You got a problem with Muppets now? -Yeah.
00:05:35.168,00:05:38.004,"Besides, he hasn't asked you out yet. Like, what is he even up to today?"
00:05:38.087,00:05:39.964,He said he was reconnecting with an old friend.
00:05:42.216,00:05:43.051,That snake.
00:05:43.926,00:05:46.179,An old friend? That is code for an ex.
00:05:46.763,00:05:47.764,No.
00:05:47.847,00:05:50.808,"Old friend, like a friend he met at a nursing home."
00:05:53.102,00:05:53.936,"Oh, my God."
00:05:55.271,00:05:57.148,"Oh, my God, it's totally code for ex."
00:05:57.648,00:05:59.567,And his friend Boomer said he has one.
00:05:59.650,00:06:06.991,See? He has a past. He has experience. You need to go get some before-- Fiji.
00:06:07.075,00:06:12.580,"Look, I know that change is scary, but if you ever want to meet this Notebook Boy, tell him."
00:06:21.339,00:06:23.049,No one's supposed to see us together.
00:06:25.468,00:06:27.887,He still thinks you put the notebook in the video drop box.
00:06:27.970,00:06:30.264,Our conversations are strictly off the record.
00:06:30.348,00:06:41.859,"Good. Because off the record, I was wondering… It's stupid, but you said your friend had an ex, and… I was wondering if there was any way they were maybe still hanging out."
00:06:41.943,00:06:43.277,"Hell, no. No."
00:06:43.361,00:06:46.656,"Him and Sofia are… are way done, as in she moved to Brazil."
00:06:46.739,00:06:57.750,"Good. He just said he was hanging out with an old friend, and everyone knows old friend is a code for ex, so I thought-- Sofia's a thousand miles away."
00:07:00.253,00:07:06.676,"You know… he never mentioned he was hanging out with an old friend, which is… which is weird."
00:07:09.429,00:07:10.763,I'm sure it's nothing.
00:07:12.682,00:07:14.892,Can you just give this to him before I change my mind?
00:07:14.976,00:07:18.312,"Yeah, I'm seeing him tonight at a party. I'll make sure he gets it."
00:07:39.208,00:07:42.336,"Sofia, you're, uh… you're back in town."
00:07:43.129,00:07:44.589,It's only been a few days.
00:07:48.676,00:07:50.011,I like your sweatshirt.
00:07:51.179,00:07:53.389,"-What does it mean? -Oh, it's from Die Hard."
00:07:55.808,00:07:57.226,You've… you've never seen Die Hard?
00:08:01.481,00:08:03.524,-That must be Dash. Mm-hmm. -That's probably Dash.
00:08:08.738,00:08:09.572,Hi.
00:08:09.655,00:08:12.116,Slim pants and a mod mock neck.
00:08:16.412,00:08:20.541,You should have seen him crying at Bergdorf's when I made him throw away his peacoat.
00:08:23.294,00:08:28.299,"Well, I think you look much improved, and I'm actually really glad Sofia got you to come because I can use you."
00:08:28.382,00:08:31.052,I need to do a book analysis for AP lit and want something impressive.
00:08:31.969,00:08:36.182,"In Cold Blood, On Beauty or Kafka on the Shore."
00:08:36.724,00:08:38.351,"Those are your favorites, right?"
00:08:38.434,00:08:41.979,"-Right. -Well, thank you, Dash, by way of Sofia."
00:08:42.063,00:08:43.773,And thank you both for picking up dessert.
00:08:43.856,00:08:47.026,"Wait, you went shopping with Sofia and picked up dessert?"
00:08:47.610,00:08:49.529,I am so glad the band is back together.
00:08:54.033,00:08:55.326,"Hey, yo, Lily."
00:08:57.203,00:08:58.829,"Um, wait. Ready?"
00:09:02.708,00:09:07.129,"No one in the world could pull off a sweater like that, but you… you are rocking it."
00:09:17.890,00:09:19.684,I got you. That was… that was good.
00:09:19.767,00:09:22.353,You're spending the day with Sofia and not telling me about it?
00:09:22.436,00:09:24.897,"Hey. No, no, no, it's not a big deal. We're just friends."
00:09:24.981,00:09:30.194,"Yeah. Well, I'm your best friend, so it's my duty to tell you that she's bad for you."
00:09:30.278,00:09:32.321,What are you talking about? I thought you liked Sofia.
00:09:32.405,00:09:34.115,"Yeah, of… of course I like Sofia."
00:09:34.198,00:09:39.120,"She's the coolest, most worldly person in the world, but… but she's wrong for you."
00:09:39.787,00:09:41.914,You're falling right back into your bad habits with her.
00:09:41.998,00:09:43.165,What bad habits?
00:09:43.249,00:09:50.339,"When you used to date, she'd style you, talk for you, and now you're back following her around like some mute zombie Ken doll."
00:09:50.965,00:09:54.176,"I… Most importantly, are you even having fun?"
00:09:54.260,00:09:56.178,This conversation isn't helping.
00:09:56.262,00:09:59.682,"Look, Lily… she makes you have fun."
00:10:00.725,00:10:03.811,She brings out the best in you. She… she… she challenges you.
00:10:08.566,00:10:09.817,Are you okay?
00:10:12.903,00:10:15.531,I'm not nervous at all for a party full of strangers.
00:10:16.032,00:10:17.366,Is it hot in here?
00:10:17.450,00:10:19.910,"Not… not that I'm sweating, if that's what you're thinking."
00:10:21.329,00:10:24.123,"-Kind of regretting the heavy cotton. -Hey, don't worry."
00:10:25.541,00:10:26.542,You're with me.
00:10:29.045,00:10:29.879,Yeah.
00:10:30.379,00:10:34.258,"All right, well, I promise to keep you abreast of all of my whereabouts going forward."
00:10:34.342,00:10:37.345,"Good. And in that spirit, I actually have to leave."
00:10:38.429,00:10:39.639,Already? Why you leaving?
00:10:39.722,00:10:43.643,"Yeah, I'm seeing a double feature of Die Hard and It's a Wonderful Life at the Angelika with Jeff."
00:10:43.726,00:10:44.852,Who's Jeff?
00:10:49.482,00:10:53.569,"Look, beware of Sofia. Don't blow a good thing with Lily, all right?"
00:11:06.290,00:11:07.124,Okay.
00:11:15.925,00:11:17.677,"Yo, my boy, you made it!"
00:11:36.153,00:11:37.113,Okay.
00:11:37.697,00:11:38.823,Make yourself at home.
00:11:45.496,00:11:49.375,"today I saw a poster for that new Pixar movie, Collation."
00:11:50.459,00:11:51.419,Have you seen it?
00:11:53.421,00:11:54.714,It's a love story.
00:11:55.339,00:11:57.800,Like You've Got Mail but with office supplies.
00:11:58.968,00:12:04.724,"And, sure, the female lead is literally a blank piece of paper, but the poster is beautiful."
00:12:06.058,00:12:13.190,"And I keep thinking about that trailer where the highlighter marker voiced by Gina Rodriguez says, Be bold."
00:12:13.274,00:12:14.942,"Hey, what up D-bag?"
00:12:17.737,00:12:18.821,Classic Dash.
00:12:18.904,00:12:20.865,"Hey, I love you, bro."
00:12:21.490,00:12:22.408,I love you.
00:12:26.829,00:12:28.539,with office supply puns together.
00:12:29.623,00:12:32.168,But be bold feels right.
00:12:34.003,00:12:39.925,"You've encouraged me to be bolder than I've ever been, so it's time for me to put it out there."
00:12:41.177,00:12:43.304,This notebook isn't enough anymore.
00:12:49.435,00:12:50.311,What do you say?
00:12:51.645,00:12:53.773,We could even see Collation.
00:13:00.070,00:13:02.323,I wish you were here with me right now too.
00:13:05.326,00:13:07.203,This is a vital decision people.
00:13:08.662,00:13:12.416,Home Alone… …or Home Alone 2.
00:13:14.293,00:13:16.962,"Guys, no, no, come on, how is that even a choice?"
00:13:17.046,00:13:19.089,The New York geography in Home Alone 2 is atrocious.
00:13:22.635,00:13:33.020,"has a view of the Manhattan skyline, and then he goes from the Empire Diner to Chinatown and then to the top of the World Trade Center, like, on foot, and then somehow makes his way uptown to the Plaza, in winter."
00:13:35.731,00:13:37.817,"Nevertheless, I love the movie. Let's do Home Alone 2."
00:14:03.008,00:14:04.051,That's a nice sweater.
00:14:04.552,00:14:07.429,I'm aware that I look ridiculous. Thanks.
00:14:07.513,00:14:14.061,"No, no, no, I'm sorry. No, no, no, you look great. I… I look ridiculous. Look at my pants. They're, like, fancy."
00:14:15.896,00:14:17.064,Check this out.
00:14:18.357,00:14:19.316,Oh!
00:14:19.817,00:14:21.068,It's a Christmas tree.
00:14:23.904,00:14:25.698,-That is very impressive. -Thanks.
00:14:27.616,00:14:30.411,"You know, I hate when people label sweaters ugly."
00:14:34.456,00:14:38.252,"Well, then I would like to say yours is very unconventionally attractive."
00:14:38.335,00:14:39.169,Thanks.
00:14:40.504,00:14:43.132,"Well, your pants are beautiful on the inside."
00:14:45.009,00:14:46.760,Metaphorically speaking. Not literally.
00:14:46.844,00:14:50.097,I don't know what's in your pants. What they're like on the in… inside.
00:14:56.186,00:14:58.689,"That's her-- I mean, you're eating her macaroon."
00:15:01.066,00:15:03.611,I don't really know anyone.
00:15:04.194,00:15:05.321,"Oh, okay."
00:15:06.363,00:15:08.032,-So then you're a burglar. -Mm-hmm.
00:15:11.493,00:15:17.416,"I will let you rob the joint as long as you, please, take me as a hostage, because I will use any excuse to leave."
00:15:17.499,00:15:18.959,Show me where they keep the jewels?
00:15:19.043,00:15:21.170,We will be at the border before they notice we're gone.
00:15:23.172,00:15:25.591,Why does that seem easier than being at a party?
00:15:25.674,00:15:30.054,"'Cause I think the only people that are actually comfortable at parties are, well, people like him."
00:15:34.016,00:15:36.518,Edgar Thibaud? Yeah. He just does whatever pops into his head.
00:15:39.688,00:15:41.732,"I don't know, people love him. I don't really get it."
00:15:43.192,00:15:44.902,-What about her? -That's so pretty.
00:15:46.528,00:15:50.783,"Practically glowing. You know, I see girls like her, and it's like they speak a different language."
00:15:50.866,00:15:52.159,She actually speaks six.
00:15:52.242,00:15:55.704,See? I bet she's never been alone at a party in her life.
00:15:55.788,00:15:57.998,"Well, if one's different, one's bound to be lonely."
00:16:04.713,00:16:07.049,At least we can be lonely together. I'm… I'm Dash.
00:16:09.593,00:16:11.929,It's almost Christmas. You promised me a dance.
00:16:12.680,00:16:21.522,"Oh… um… Yeah, I… I think this party's getting a little too tame."
00:16:21.605,00:16:23.941,"I say we, uh… we spice it up a little bit, huh?"
00:16:24.608,00:16:28.237,"You like dares, don't you, Dash? Why don't we play Truth or Dare?"
00:16:28.946,00:16:29.905,Yes.
00:16:35.577,00:16:38.330,Dash… truth or dare?
00:16:40.374,00:16:41.917,"Come on, don't be boring."
00:16:44.003,00:16:46.797,Uh… Dare.
00:16:52.094,00:16:53.303,and travel back in time.
00:17:01.395,00:17:02.229,Okay.
00:17:09.570,00:17:12.656,Now it's your turn.
00:17:13.365,00:17:14.241,Truth or dare?
00:17:17.161,00:17:17.995,Truth?
00:17:19.955,00:17:24.126,What is… the craziest place that you've ever hooked up?
00:17:27.588,00:17:30.174,What is the craziest place you've ever made out?
00:17:32.885,00:17:36.305,Um… Held hands?
00:17:45.606,00:17:46.982,"Come on, tell me where we're going."
00:17:50.694,00:17:53.113,"Well, I know how uncomfortable you are in crowds."
00:17:53.197,00:17:54.031,"Oh, yeah."
00:17:54.114,00:18:00.370,"And I remember you always said that museums would be great if it weren't for all the people, so…."
00:18:06.168,00:18:07.002,Voilà.
00:18:10.297,00:18:11.465,For everybody else.
00:18:12.049,00:18:13.675,Priya's dad is on the board.
00:18:14.218,00:18:15.427,She owed me.
00:18:15.511,00:18:17.179,You ready to travel back in time?
00:18:24.561,00:18:26.313,You took us here on our first date.
00:18:27.856,00:18:28.857,You were so nervous.
00:18:28.941,00:18:31.443,You didn't say anything until we got to the Old Masters.
00:18:31.527,00:18:33.445,-And then you called them-- -Overrated.
00:18:38.617,00:18:40.994,"Look, it's your ideal girl."
00:18:42.162,00:18:43.247,She's on a pedestal.
00:18:46.625,00:18:48.085,I should get her number.
00:18:58.220,00:18:59.638,What are you smiling about?
00:19:00.889,00:19:03.642,I'm just realizing that this night reminds me of a book.
00:19:05.352,00:19:08.897,"It's about, like, these two kids who run away from home to live in a museum."
00:19:10.440,00:19:12.276,I don't know that book. What's it called?
00:19:12.860,00:19:21.076,From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E… Frankweiler.
00:19:26.623,00:19:28.167,-What are you doing? -Come on.
00:19:33.005,00:19:33.839,I dare you.
00:19:36.258,00:19:41.722,"All right, listen up. My dare is for everyone to play strip poker. Yes?"
00:19:44.683,00:19:51.148,"We do that every year, so… Wait, Lily, Lily, wait. Don't… don't go yet. We're having fun."
00:19:52.191,00:19:53.984,I have to get home before my curfew.
00:19:56.153,00:19:58.322,"All right, well, at least let me call you an Uber."
00:19:59.156,00:20:00.365,Okay. Sure.
00:20:01.450,00:20:02.284,Thank you.
00:20:05.287,00:20:06.997,Have you really never been kissed?
00:20:08.207,00:20:09.041,Why?
00:20:09.625,00:20:10.751,Because I'm weird?
00:20:11.335,00:20:12.961,"No, because you're beautiful."
00:20:26.892,00:20:32.981,"I'm so sorry. This holiday surge pricing is way too expensive, and my dad is such a dick about keeping me on a budge."
00:20:33.690,00:20:37.319,Could you call your own Uber?
00:20:46.703,00:20:47.537,"Night, Lily."
00:21:02.010,00:21:03.345,Thirty minutes early.
00:21:03.971,00:21:06.181,"Hope you had a nice time caroling, Lily-bear."
00:21:12.604,00:21:14.815,At least tomorrow I'll know your name.
00:21:22.739,00:21:37.379,"No. No… no more dares, like… -Come on, what are we really doing here? -Well, the truth is… if I could actually go back in time… I'd travel to when we were still together."
00:21:37.462,00:21:39.965,"No, you would not want that, trust me."
00:21:40.048,00:21:40.924,Why not?
00:21:41.800,00:21:44.469,"Come on, it wasn't just you going to Brazil that broke us up."
00:21:44.553,00:21:46.138,It was me.
00:21:47.180,00:21:51.226,Um… I was putting up walls. I was never truly myself when I was with you.
00:21:53.812,00:21:55.981,"Oh, I agree, but you've changed so much."
00:21:56.982,00:21:58.483,"Maybe, but we still haven't."
00:22:00.485,00:22:03.280,"At the party, you answered pretty much every question for me."
00:22:03.947,00:22:07.451,I was just trying to help. I know how much you hate talking at parties.
00:22:07.534,00:22:11.121,"Yes, but if you always talk for me, then I'm never gonna talk to anyone."
00:22:11.204,00:22:13.665,I… I don't need you to protect me.
00:22:16.043,00:22:16.877,You're right.
00:22:18.128,00:22:19.046,I see that now.
00:22:23.842,00:22:30.182,If you want the truth… I'd like us to be more than friends.
00:10:14.363,00:10:17.575,"I'm sorry, Mom. I didn't realize how late it was. I'm on my way."
00:00:16.349,00:00:17.517,It's Christmas morning!
00:00:22.897,00:00:26.818,wearing matching pajamas in front of a tree piled with presents.
00:00:32.991,00:00:37.454,"At least this year, Notebook Boy, I have the gift of your name to look forward to."
00:00:42.917,00:00:43.960,Merry Christmas.
00:00:45.545,00:00:46.713,The notebook.
00:00:46.796,00:00:48.590,That's the book on serial killers I got Dad.
00:00:50.175,00:00:52.802,"If the notebook's not here yet, I'm sure there's a reason."
00:00:53.386,00:00:54.220,Yeah.
00:00:55.889,00:00:57.265,Did you have fun at the party?
00:01:12.405,00:01:13.698,"Merry Christmas, Grandpa."
00:01:13.782,00:01:18.536,-Where do you think you're going? -To Mrs. Basil E's-- -To Great-Aunt Lillian's. -Why?
00:01:18.620,00:01:21.081,I promised her I would help her bake cookies.
00:01:21.581,00:01:24.667,I can think of few activities my sister would enjoy less.
00:01:24.751,00:01:27.045,It's not like anyone's celebrating here.
00:01:28.004,00:01:29.172,Be home by 6:00.
00:01:29.255,00:01:30.090,Thank you.
00:01:42.644,00:01:43.520,Merry Christmas.
00:01:43.603,00:01:45.438,"Oh, merry Christmas, darling."
00:01:45.522,00:01:47.690,"Did, uh, anyone leave anything for me?"
00:01:47.774,00:01:52.070,"Uh, maybe something red that's, uh, shaped like a notebook?"
00:01:52.570,00:01:56.241,I haven't seen our friend since he brought me a boot.
00:02:01.121,00:02:03.998,I told him I was ready to meet. I don't know when it will happen.
00:02:08.128,00:02:15.760,Have you considered what you'll do if the person in person isn't the one in your head?
00:02:16.344,00:02:17.178,You met him.
00:02:17.762,00:02:18.596,You liked him.
00:02:19.180,00:02:21.975,"His persnicketiness charmed me, I admit."
00:02:22.058,00:02:24.811,But it's whether you like him that counts.
00:02:24.894,00:02:27.605,And you'll have to discover that for yourself.
00:02:28.106,00:02:29.983,He said he'd bring the notebook here.
00:02:30.608,00:02:39.868,What if he forgot? What… what if I said the wrong thing and scared him off and-- It's my caroling troupe.
00:02:40.368,00:02:43.246,They want me to join them at McSorley's.
00:02:43.329,00:02:46.207,"Ah, McSorley's."
00:02:46.291,00:02:51.504,I went there with Estelle Getty and the cast of Hair.
00:02:51.588,00:03:08.396,"They didn't allow women yet… but they made an exception when Estelle and I climbed on the bar, hiked up our skirts and… You should be with your friends."
00:03:09.522,00:03:11.107,What if the notebook comes?
00:03:11.191,00:03:12.775,I'll dash it right over!
00:03:14.027,00:03:15.445,No pun intended.
00:03:18.990,00:03:20.033,What pun?
00:03:21.159,00:03:22.660,"I said, Have fun, dear."
00:03:28.208,00:03:31.211,Dash. Why would dash be a pun?
00:03:31.294,00:03:34.172,What does it mean? Is he fast?
00:03:34.839,00:03:36.633,Is he a hyphen?
00:03:42.889,00:03:44.390,A connector of words.
00:03:45.183,00:03:47.060,-His name is-- -I'm Dash.
00:03:48.353,00:03:49.229,"Oh, no."
00:03:50.813,00:03:54.692,I knew I'd find you in a corner. You promised me a dance.
00:03:54.776,00:03:55.985,"Oh, no."
00:03:58.655,00:04:00.740,Lily? How did you get my number?
00:04:00.823,00:04:05.161,"Called Two Boots, told them I was your girlfriend, in the Army, and I wanted to surprise you for Christmas."
00:04:05.245,00:04:07.538,-That worked? -It's an emergency.
00:04:07.622,00:04:10.667,It's about your friend… Dash.
00:04:13.336,00:04:14.796,"Oh, he didn't tell you."
00:04:15.838,00:04:16.881,But I just did.
00:04:22.178,00:04:24.472,You know it's against the rules. I… I can't answer that.
00:04:24.555,00:04:26.641,-Please. You have to tell me. -I… I can't.
00:04:26.724,00:04:29.852,"Because if it's him, he left the party with his ex."
00:04:30.645,00:04:31.479,He did what?
00:04:31.562,00:04:34.148,Please tell me I'm wrong. I want to be wrong.
00:04:35.191,00:04:36.359,"Look, you're not wrong."
00:04:50.164,00:04:52.875,"Notebook Boy has a girlfriend, and he's been keeping it from me."
00:04:53.376,00:04:54.711,"Oh, honey."
00:04:55.253,00:04:56.087,Drink up.
00:04:57.338,00:04:59.424,"-Hey, you're not old enough to. -Shh."
00:04:59.924,00:05:00.758,Nope.
00:05:04.762,00:05:05.596,"Ew, nope."
00:05:09.350,00:05:11.978,-This tastes like a candy cane. -Peppermint schnapps.
00:05:18.359,00:05:19.652,I want another one.
00:05:22.405,00:05:23.740,He didn't forget me.
00:05:26.409,00:05:29.162,"And she's perfect, and so is he."
00:05:37.670,00:05:39.672,But then he left with her.
00:05:39.756,00:05:40.715,Hmm.
00:05:40.798,00:05:45.303,"And… and I've never been kissed, and I don't care that everyone heard that."
00:05:45.928,00:05:50.350,"And there was this guy who acted like he was gonna kiss me, but he didn't."
00:05:50.433,00:05:52.560,Text him and tell him how you feel.
00:06:06.532,00:06:08.159,Here's to your first heartbreak.
00:06:14.290,00:06:16.501,-I'll get you one. Okay. -Thank you.
00:06:23.800,00:06:25.760,How did you get here?
00:06:25.843,00:06:28.221,"You texted me, you weirdo."
00:06:28.721,00:06:34.310,But I don't have your… So you wanted me to kiss you?
00:06:46.989,00:06:50.660,"So, why didn't you… kiss me?"
00:06:51.494,00:06:52.995,"Well, I was thinking about it."
00:06:53.079,00:07:05.842,"But then you said that you'd never been kissed, Mistletoe."
00:07:06.342,00:07:07.927,I stole it from outside.
00:07:08.553,00:07:27.530,"Actually, it's holly. But a lot of people make that-- Lily?"
00:07:55.391,00:07:56.225,What's wrong?
00:07:57.435,00:07:58.978,It just doesn't feel right.
00:08:02.565,00:08:05.693,"No, I'm… I'm kissing you, but I'm thinking about her."
00:08:08.696,00:08:11.365,You're a disappointment as a time-travel companion.
00:08:15.661,00:08:17.830,"Look, I don't want to start this again."
00:08:20.666,00:08:22.668,And I don't really think you do either.
00:08:24.962,00:08:27.840,You don't understand because you've always lived in New York.
00:08:29.425,00:08:34.972,"For me… every year, my dad gets a new post, and I get a new country."
00:08:37.808,00:08:43.314,And I come back and… You were comfortable.
00:08:44.482,00:08:45.441,Familiar.
00:08:47.777,00:08:50.196,So I'm like that peacoat you made me throw away.
00:08:52.240,00:08:53.241,You have changed.
00:08:55.660,00:08:59.664,But I see now that… you changed for her.
00:09:01.666,00:09:05.503,Guess that means we're… done.
00:09:08.256,00:09:09.131,It's sad.
00:09:11.384,00:09:12.510,But it's good to know.
00:09:14.762,00:09:16.180,We should probably go home.
00:09:17.640,00:09:24.272,Or… how many times in our lives will we be able to say we slept at the Morgan Library on Christmas Eve?
00:09:28.693,00:09:33.531,And it's the perfect place for us to spend our last night together… as friends.
00:09:36.450,00:10:19.994,Um… No! I forgot to get Lily the notebook. God!
00:10:20.870,00:10:21.704,Hey.
00:10:22.496,00:10:24.498,"You want some advice, as a friend?"
00:10:25.750,00:10:29.545,"If what you have is real, she deserves more than a notebook for Christmas."
00:10:31.964,00:10:33.341,The city's not that big.
00:10:42.725,00:10:44.644,What? When did I download a mommy app?
00:10:47.730,00:10:49.065,I'm downloading the mommy app.
00:10:49.148,00:10:52.193,I'll upload a photo of her boot and set you up for notifications.
00:10:52.276,00:10:54.904,"These women, they know everything."
00:11:17.677,00:11:21.013,"Hi, two tickets for Collation, the eight o'clock show."
00:11:21.097,00:11:24.725,"It's amazing. I've never cried harder, and I've seen The Notebook 20 times."
00:11:24.809,00:11:26.018,Collation is sad?
00:11:26.936,00:11:27.853,Tears of joy.
00:11:30.064,00:11:31.190,I'm taking this girl.
00:11:31.273,00:11:33.109,"We've been writing each other, but we never met."
00:11:33.192,00:11:36.612,"I didn't know how to find her, but then this morning, I saw this post on this mommy app."
00:11:36.696,00:11:38.280,-Okay. Mm-hmm. -See? That's her.
00:11:41.992,00:11:48.040,"Sir, this information showing up exactly when I needed it, it's… This is fate! This is the magic of Christmas!"
00:11:48.124,00:11:49.625,Get out of the freaking line.
00:11:50.251,00:11:53.295,"Merry Christmas, you beautiful, angry New Yorker."
00:12:15.735,00:12:16.819,Lily?
00:12:28.330,00:12:29.915,How did you know where I am?
00:12:30.875,00:12:32.835,I don't even know where I am.
00:12:32.918,00:12:34.503,You're the girl from the party.
00:12:35.212,00:12:36.839,And you're Dash.
00:12:38.340,00:12:39.759,Connector of words.
00:12:41.635,00:12:42.636,"What's up, Dash?"
00:12:44.305,00:12:45.347,You're with him.
00:12:47.266,00:12:48.225,Of course you are.
00:12:50.519,00:12:52.271,How long's this been going on for?
00:12:52.354,00:12:54.273,As if you didn't kiss Sofia?
00:12:55.232,00:12:57.318,"Wait, you two know each other?"
00:12:58.986,00:12:59.945,Thought I did.
00:13:01.363,00:13:03.240,-You all right? -I don't feel so good.
00:13:03.324,00:13:05.785,-You've been drinking? -So much.
00:13:06.285,00:13:08.078,It's okay. I'll get her home.
00:13:11.582,00:13:12.792,Where's my coat?
00:13:15.085,00:13:16.462,"Um, I know where to take her."
00:13:16.545,00:13:18.589,It's okay. Don't worry about it. I'll… I'll take her.
00:13:18.672,00:13:19.924,"No, I'll take her myself."
00:13:28.682,00:13:30.643,Hey. I'm Thibaud.
00:13:35.898,00:13:36.732,Thibaud?
00:13:40.611,00:13:42.404,"Of all the guys, it had to be Edgar Thibaud?"
00:13:42.488,00:13:44.323,"I mean, what do you even see in him?"
00:13:45.199,00:13:46.742,He's easy to be with.
00:13:47.451,00:13:48.410,He's fun.
00:13:49.119,00:13:51.956,"Oh, so you mean he's not depressing… like me?"
00:13:52.623,00:13:54.416,I don't know anything about you.
00:13:55.668,00:13:58.504,"Except, oh, yeah, I know you lied."
00:13:59.421,00:14:06.762,Because you spent the night with a girl who's obnoxiously perfect and stupidly amazing and unfairly gorgeous.
00:14:09.640,00:14:12.685,You left the party wearing those clothes. I'm not stupid.
00:14:13.644,00:14:15.521,"No, Sofia and I broke up a year ago."
00:14:15.604,00:14:20.025,The only thing that happened last night was me affirming to her that we are not getting back together.
00:14:20.109,00:14:23.028,"Well, why didn't you tell me you were still seeing her in the notebook?"
00:14:29.118,00:14:32.955,"I'm not with Edgar either, for your information."
00:14:33.914,00:14:36.417,It was just a kiss. It didn't mean anything to me.
00:14:37.209,00:14:39.628,"Oh, so you're just kissing a lot of meaningless guys then, huh?"
00:14:39.712,00:14:41.213,It was my first kiss.
00:14:41.714,00:14:44.633,"And I wanted it to be with you, but you weren't there."
00:14:45.384,00:14:47.803,You told me the notebook would be under the tree but it wasn't.
00:14:47.887,00:14:50.472,"I'm sorry I was late. What, do you have that little faith in me?"
00:14:50.556,00:14:53.767,You're so judgy. You have no idea what I've been going through.
00:14:53.851,00:14:57.521,"Well, I thought I did. I thought that was the whole point of the notebook."
00:14:57.605,00:14:59.857,"Well, I guess we both kept secrets from each other."
00:15:00.524,00:15:03.986,I hate that stupid notebook. It wasn't even my idea. It was my brother's.
00:15:04.695,00:15:06.780,He wrote those first clues at The Strand.
00:15:12.077,00:15:13.704,You're nothing like Boomer said.
00:15:17.041,00:15:17.875,You met Boomer?
00:15:19.835,00:15:21.211,He said you'd be nicer.
00:15:45.986,00:15:47.279,"There, there, dear."
00:15:47.363,00:15:49.740,Go in and lay down on the couch.
00:15:50.991,00:15:53.160,I appreciate you bringing her here.
00:15:53.243,00:15:56.622,"This is highly uncharacteristic of her, I promise you."
00:15:58.207,00:15:59.208,"No, it's all right."
00:16:00.876,00:16:12.304,"This doesn't have to be goodbye. I'm sure, when she sobers up-- No, no, I'm… I'm gonna go. This was… I don't know. This was never gonna be as easy as it was in the notebook."
00:16:13.681,00:16:18.560,Well… you don't want to give up just when the game's gotten interesting.
00:16:21.397,00:16:23.357,I guess I don't want to play a game anymore.
00:16:31.490,00:16:33.784,"And what have we learned, Lily?"
00:16:34.910,00:16:39.123,"Um, taking too many sips of other people's drinks leads to headaches."
00:16:40.374,00:16:41.959,And heartaches.
00:16:42.584,00:16:43.585,And?
00:16:43.669,00:16:45.170,Don't mix your drinks.
00:16:46.880,00:16:48.757,That must be your grandfather.
00:16:48.841,00:16:50.426,Wha… what time is it?
00:16:50.509,00:16:52.094,"Six-thirty, why?"
00:16:52.177,00:16:54.221,I told him I'd be home by 6:00.
00:16:54.972,00:16:58.350,"-Please don't let him see me like this. -I'm sorry, my dear."
00:16:58.934,00:17:00.936,I can't save you from this one.
00:17:13.073,00:17:13.907,No.
00:17:14.408,00:17:16.785,I could smell the alcohol when I walked in the door.
00:17:16.869,00:17:18.746,Have you tried peppermint schnapps?
00:17:19.413,00:17:21.874,You should try it. It might help you relax.
00:17:21.957,00:17:24.376,"Lily, don't dig any deeper."
00:17:33.886,00:17:38.057,-Of course not. She went out! -Do you even know where she went?
00:17:39.933,00:17:40.768,Let's go.
00:17:51.445,00:17:53.238,Why aren't you talking to me?
00:17:53.322,00:17:55.157,You lied when I asked if you'd been drinking.
00:17:55.240,00:17:57.159,You lied about going to my sister's.
00:17:57.242,00:17:59.203,I didn't lie about that.
00:17:59.286,00:18:01.080,I can't keep up with your lies.
00:18:01.705,00:18:04.416,No… It's not what you think.
00:18:05.667,00:18:06.543,Grandpa.
00:18:13.008,00:18:13.967,Mom?
00:18:17.054,00:18:18.347,Merry Christmas.
00:18:21.391,00:18:22.226,Lily?
00:18:40.869,00:18:42.371,Is this the robot I was promised?
00:18:42.996,00:18:44.373,Lily told me you met.
00:18:46.917,00:18:47.960,Why didn't you tell me?
00:18:48.627,00:18:50.420,"Yo, I was trying to help you out."
00:18:51.338,00:18:53.674,"Well, you didn't help because now everything is ruined."
00:18:53.757,00:18:55.634,-What? -What else are you lying to me about?
00:18:57.136,00:18:58.720,"Come on, don't be like that, man."
00:18:58.804,00:19:00.681,You know nobody got your back more than me.
00:19:01.640,00:19:02.891,"Well, look, join us."
00:19:02.975,00:19:06.562,We got a weird-looking roast in the oven and the eggnog is gonna be fire.
00:19:07.813,00:19:09.231,I'd probably get salmonella.
00:19:10.315,00:19:11.567,I was just looking out for you.
00:19:12.276,00:19:13.610,I can look out for myself.
00:19:28.959,00:19:30.127,How are you feeling?
00:19:34.840,00:19:36.592,Are you trying to break our hearts?
00:19:37.134,00:19:42.848,After your dad and I literally moved heaven and earth to get back here early so we could spend Christmas with you.
00:19:44.433,00:19:45.851,You did all this for me?
00:19:46.435,00:19:47.686,It was Langston's idea.
00:19:50.939,00:19:53.317,Why didn't you tell me the truth about the trip?
00:19:54.067,00:19:56.528,We didn't wanna ruin Christmas for you.
00:19:57.112,00:19:59.281,But that's exactly what happened.
00:19:59.364,00:20:01.325,"Well, brace yourself."
00:20:01.408,00:20:02.326,There's more.
00:20:02.951,00:20:03.785,What?
00:20:04.286,00:20:07.831,That job I went to interview for… I got the offer.
00:20:08.415,00:20:10.334,It starts right after New Year's.
00:20:11.335,00:20:13.587,We have to move-- In a week?
00:20:21.386,00:20:22.596,It's all too much.
00:20:23.180,00:20:26.975,"Thousands of miles away, a new home, a new school."
00:20:27.851,00:20:31.271,I've been doing contract work for the last year. It… it hardly pays.
00:20:31.355,00:20:36.401,There's no benefits and no future. I… I know it's… it's far.
00:20:37.110,00:20:39.321,We belong in Manhattan.
00:20:39.404,00:20:41.448,We live in Grandpa's apartment.
00:20:42.032,00:20:43.784,Next week is too soon.
00:20:44.326,00:20:47.079,Everything I love is here.
00:20:47.162,00:20:50.749,It's happening… with or without your support.
00:20:51.250,00:20:52.542,But we hope with.
00:20:54.711,00:20:55.754,I hate this.
00:20:57.297,00:20:58.131,We do too.
00:21:01.093,00:21:03.428,Put on your pj's and come join the party?
00:21:04.346,00:21:07.140,It's gonna be the last big family gathering for a while.
00:21:13.230,00:21:20.862,"And tomorrow, you're gonna have a lot of explaining to do about that boot and what looks to me like a hangover."
00:21:47.472,00:21:52.644,"I was never gonna be the guy in your head, and you were never gonna be the girl in mine."
00:22:01.236,00:22:03.447,There's no such thing as a Christmas miracle.
00:22:04.072,00:22:05.282,And it's not your fault.
00:22:07.117,00:22:08.327,It's mine for believing.
00:22:14.791,00:22:17.753,Thanks for playing the game with me. It was fun for a while.
00:22:19.296,00:22:22.341,But the thing about playing a game is someone has to lose.
00:22:23.592,00:22:25.344,And I guess we both lost this time.
00:22:37.189,00:22:39.399,I don't think we should see each other again.
00:22:39.941,00:22:40.901,I don't want us to.
00:22:44.112,00:22:45.697,It's better if we both move on.
00:00:24.190,00:00:25.734,I'm happy to find it for you.
00:00:28.111,00:00:29.988,"Um, what I'm looking for isn't here."
00:00:44.335,00:00:45.253,You never saw me.
00:00:51.801,00:00:54.554,"I can say that now, because I finally know your name."
00:00:55.680,00:00:58.349,"A week ago, that seemed so important."
00:01:01.186,00:01:02.687,It's funny how things change.
00:01:03.188,00:01:06.691,I used to think we'd meet and have this great romance.
00:01:08.193,00:01:10.445,I believed New York was magic.
00:01:12.155,00:01:15.533,"Osoji, kiddo. A chance to leave everything bad behind."
00:01:19.329,00:01:22.248,"and at midnight tonight, I'm getting on a plane to Fiji."
00:01:25.752,00:01:26.669,I'm moving.
00:01:30.590,00:01:31.549,I'm moving on.
00:01:39.182,00:01:43.645,But at least for one last Christmas… it was nice to believe.
00:01:52.904,00:01:55.782,I still don't think it's fair that you can't stay in the city like me.
00:01:55.865,00:01:57.867,It's just till I finish high school.
00:01:57.951,00:02:00.620,"Well, until then, I got you a going-away present."
00:02:00.703,00:02:02.455,-Aw. -From Levain Bakery.
00:02:05.583,00:02:06.668,"Yeah, probably not."
00:02:08.128,00:02:11.673,"-You wanna talk about boys? -It was so bad, Langston."
00:02:11.756,00:02:14.717,"I was drunk, kissing the wrong guy."
00:02:14.801,00:02:17.720,"Then he showed up, and he told me it was over."
00:02:18.304,00:02:19.722,I'm fine. Really.
00:02:20.265,00:02:25.019,"A new country is a new start, and, you know, that… that actually sounds really nice right now."
00:02:27.105,00:02:27.939,What?
00:02:31.067,00:02:31.901,Yeah?
00:02:32.902,00:02:34.320,"This time, I know you will be."
00:02:36.823,00:02:40.034,-Did I ever tell you about my first kiss? -No.
00:02:40.118,00:02:41.119,I don't remember it.
00:02:43.163,00:02:49.377,"My second kiss. Tyler Carr, pool party, hiding under one of those giant inflatable tubes."
00:02:53.173,00:02:54.674,It's not about the first kiss.
00:02:55.466,00:02:57.010,It's about the first one that matters.
00:02:58.178,00:03:00.763,"You know, a new start doesn't require a new country."
00:03:01.973,00:03:03.892,I'm so sorry about Benny.
00:03:03.975,00:03:06.978,I can't believe he was gonna move to Puerto Rico without telling you.
00:03:07.061,00:03:08.563,"Oh, no, he's not moving."
00:03:09.230,00:03:12.400,He's visiting his abuelita for the first two weeks of January.
00:03:13.193,00:03:16.446,You dumped him because he's going to Puerto Rico for two weeks?
00:03:16.529,00:03:17.947,That's way too long to be apart.
00:03:18.031,00:03:20.992,-Langston! -Ow! What? You know I'm bad at distance!
00:03:21.075,00:03:23.369,"-Oh, my God. -Stop hit-- Ow!"
00:03:23.453,00:03:24.913,"Hey, is Boomer home?"
00:03:25.455,00:03:29.125,"Right. But is he actually not home, or are you covering for him because he's avoiding me?"
00:03:30.043,00:03:33.713,"Well, no offense, but that's exactly what you would say if you were covering for him."
00:03:34.631,00:03:35.798,I'm not being finicky!
00:03:36.674,00:03:39.135,All right. Could… could you at least tell me where he is?
00:03:40.511,00:03:42.263,"Okay, well, thank you for nothing."
00:03:56.861,00:03:59.197,"I only have eight hours, Boomer. Where are you?"
00:04:01.908,00:04:02.784,"Oh, hell, no."
00:04:05.036,00:04:06.871,"Happy New Year, Hudson Yards!"
00:04:51.499,00:04:52.792,Hey! Boomer!
00:04:53.543,00:04:57.046,"Boom-- Hey, seriously? Boomer. Boomer, come on."
00:04:57.130,00:04:58.923,I'm not talking to you.
00:04:59.007,00:05:01.134,You blew me off on Christmas. Christmas?
00:05:01.217,00:05:03.386,"I… No… I'm… I'm sorry, but I need your help."
00:05:03.469,00:05:09.684,"I'm done helping you. I… I know you pride yourself on being a loner, but there's a line between being a loner and being a dick."
00:05:09.767,00:05:13.021,"He's not talking to you! Don't talk to him, Boomer."
00:05:14.272,00:05:17.400,-Why are you at a concert with Priya? -I have friends besides you.
00:05:18.151,00:05:21.612,Bro! I heard you were a real putz on Christmas. Not cool.
00:05:21.696,00:05:22.780,We do not stan.
00:05:22.864,00:05:25.533,Are you just hanging out with everybody I know without me?
00:05:25.616,00:05:27.827,Look who emerged from his Hundred Years of Solitude.
00:05:27.910,00:05:29.996,-Dude. -You pushed us away.
00:05:31.122,00:05:38.379,"I haven't heard from you in a week. Now you're showing up, you're texting, and you're thinking we're all cool? Like I'm just gonna forgive you."
00:05:39.714,00:05:41.632,I came to a Jonas Brothers concert for you.
00:05:49.140,00:05:51.517,You came to a Jonas Brothers concert for me?
00:05:53.269,00:05:56.981,"-Um, is there somewhere we could talk? -Dude, and miss the show?"
00:05:57.065,00:05:58.441,"Well, it's about Lily."
00:05:59.692,00:06:00.651,We got this.
00:06:15.124,00:06:18.836,"She says that she is moving to Fiji, and she's flying out at midnight."
00:06:25.343,00:06:28.096,"Sorry, but if it was me, I wouldn't want anything more to do with you."
00:06:28.179,00:06:31.265,"No, she said that she stopped believing. That's not the Lily I know."
00:06:31.349,00:06:32.600,Maybe you don't know her.
00:06:32.683,00:06:35.269,Maybe she's just the girl in your head.
00:06:35.353,00:06:36.938,"No, I know it's important."
00:06:37.021,00:06:40.400,"If she stopped believing, that's on me. I need to do something. I need to fix it."
00:06:40.483,00:06:45.613,"I don't know, man. If… if this is about making yourself feel better-- I cannot stop thinking about her."
00:06:48.366,00:06:51.911,"And if she leaves tonight, I'm never gonna get the chance to tell her that."
00:06:53.121,00:06:55.832,"So, what are you doing here? Go… go find her."
00:06:55.915,00:06:58.876,"Well, I did that on Christmas. It just made things worse."
00:06:58.960,00:07:04.257,"Oh, Dash. You've read so many books, but you're still hung up on fairy tales."
00:07:04.340,00:07:05.299,What do you mean?
00:07:05.383,00:07:08.261,People think fairy tales are for girls.
00:07:08.344,00:07:10.179,Who do you think wrote them in the first place?
00:07:11.806,00:07:14.767,Men see every girl as a princess to be rescued.
00:07:15.643,00:07:17.687,And they see themselves as the prince.
00:07:18.229,00:07:19.897,Operation: Cinderella.
00:07:20.565,00:07:24.777,"When you went to Lily before, you were trying to be Prince Charming."
00:07:25.653,00:07:29.031,If you really care about her-- You need to go to her as you.
00:07:30.867,00:07:31.951,Your friends are right.
00:07:32.034,00:07:35.705,"If you want this girl to give you a second chance, you gotta get real."
00:07:36.497,00:07:38.416,"Also, why are you in my trailer?"
00:07:38.499,00:07:39.834,This is his trailer?
00:07:40.835,00:07:43.796,"We went to band camp together. Sounded tight out there, bro."
00:07:45.339,00:07:46.841,I need to go to her as me.
00:07:47.592,00:07:51.179,"When I proposed, okay, I had to dig deep. I had to get vulnerable."
00:07:54.265,00:07:56.934,"That's good. That's really good. All right, we gotta go."
00:07:57.018,00:08:00.229,"-I wasn't done with my story, though. -No. Oh, you were perfect."
00:08:00.313,00:08:02.356,"-You were great. Thank you, Nick Jonas. -See ya, bro."
00:08:03.608,00:08:04.442,All right.
00:08:51.656,00:08:53.783,I thought that deserved a little ceremony.
00:09:22.019,00:09:25.189,He's breaking out the otoshidama. You're in for it now.
00:09:25.690,00:09:27.441,No. Grandpa's not mad at me.
00:09:28.609,00:09:30.570,He probably forgot all about Christmas.
00:09:32.572,00:09:35.449,"Lily, take it from someone who has experience disappointing Grandpa."
00:09:35.533,00:09:41.372,"You think he's forgotten… until New Year's, when he tells you everything you've done wrong in front of the entire family."
00:09:41.872,00:09:44.250,In exchange for an envelope full of cash.
00:09:44.834,00:09:46.210,It's a super fun tradition.
00:09:48.004,00:09:50.047,"Look on the bright side, those look like 20s."
00:09:50.548,00:09:51.424,Langston.
00:09:52.174,00:09:53.384,Watch a pro.
00:09:57.972,00:10:00.391,I'd like to discuss your old year first.
00:10:12.069,00:10:12.945,Nailed it.
00:10:17.074,00:10:18.326,Is that my envelope?
00:10:18.409,00:10:21.454,"Then, last week, I find a naked boy in your room."
00:10:27.001,00:10:28.836,I assume this means your heart has healed.
00:10:30.630,00:10:33.299,"Yet, you haven't mentioned returning to school."
00:10:34.508,00:10:36.427,Can I expect that to change in the new year?
00:10:39.013,00:10:41.641,"Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm ready to go back, Grandpa."
00:10:43.100,00:10:43.934,Good.
00:10:46.437,00:10:47.271,Lily.
00:11:01.619,00:11:03.621,I know a place that puts cheese on pie.
00:11:04.747,00:11:06.165,I'll bring a Two Boots.
00:11:06.749,00:11:08.209,Do you think this will work?
00:11:08.292,00:11:09.210,"You got this, bro."
00:11:14.965,00:11:16.550,Guess it's up to fate now.
00:11:17.093,00:11:19.178,Not fate. It's up to you.
00:11:19.804,00:11:20.680,Good luck.
00:11:26.310,00:11:27.228,My Lily-bear.
00:11:28.354,00:11:30.523,I've always been able to count on you.
00:11:32.525,00:11:34.860,Which makes this year especially troubling.
00:11:36.278,00:11:40.032,I thought finding you out all night was an isolated act.
00:11:40.116,00:11:51.460,"I've heard reports from multiple members of the family, Sal at Macy's, Mark at The Strand, Leroy in Central Park-- The statue? He doesn't even talk!"
00:11:51.544,00:11:53.462,They told me what you've been up to.
00:11:54.171,00:12:00.261,"Breaking curfew, lying, going to parties, running all over the city with some boy."
00:12:02.763,00:12:11.981,"When I heard about your father's new job, I didn't want you to uproot your life. I planned to let you stay here with me."
00:12:12.773,00:12:19.572,But now I realize that New York City is no place for a… teenager.
00:12:23.617,00:12:25.286,"Uh, this is a family gathering."
00:12:25.369,00:12:28.414,-I am part of this family. -Then you can hear this too.
00:12:32.752,00:12:33.878,You've changed.
00:12:35.421,00:12:38.257,I don't recognize my own granddaughter.
00:12:38.340,00:12:44.388,"I believe a new home will be good for you, unless you tell me it wasn't your fault."
00:12:44.930,00:12:47.141,That boy made you do it.
00:12:47.224,00:12:50.978,He's responsible… isn't he?
00:12:56.192,00:12:58.903,I'm 17. That's what I'm supposed to be doing.
00:12:58.986,00:13:00.237,What's your excuse?
00:13:01.405,00:13:06.202,"You… you refuse to compromise with Great-Aunt Lillian, and now you're doing the same thing with Mabel in Florida."
00:13:06.285,00:13:07.787,Do you wanna end up alone?
00:13:13.250,00:13:15.711,That's not a reason to break up with someone.
00:13:15.795,00:13:19.006,I… I can't believe I was taking relationship advice from you.
00:13:19.089,00:13:25.596,The men in our family have some seriously mixed-up ideas about relationships.
00:13:25.679,00:13:29.225,"Mom and Dad, you should have told me that Dad lost his job."
00:13:30.226,00:13:33.103,"I would have been worried, but I had the right to know."
00:13:34.730,00:13:41.737,"As for that boy, I'm sorry I disappointed you, Grandpa, but he didn't make me do anything."
00:13:42.530,00:13:44.949,"All of those mistakes, I made myself."
00:13:52.957,00:13:53.791,Time to go.
00:13:55.000,00:13:58.254,First home and then… I know.
00:13:59.004,00:13:59.839,I'm ready.
00:14:15.604,00:14:17.398,But I like it when it's cold.
00:14:25.739,00:14:26.699,"Lily, wait!"
00:14:30.911,00:14:33.247,"Uh, happy New Year."
00:15:07.281,00:15:09.158,You wanna tell me about the boy?
00:15:13.078,00:15:14.830,You can always write to each other.
00:15:50.366,00:15:52.326,-I have to close up. -Just give me 20 more minutes.
00:15:52.409,00:15:53.494,I have a date.
00:15:53.577,00:15:57.289,I'm taking her to see the ball drop in Times Square. I'm not ashamed of that.
00:15:57.373,00:16:00.042,"Fifteen, and I will… I'll organize the fiction section."
00:16:02.378,00:16:03.879,The children's section.
00:16:05.297,00:16:06.465,"She's not coming, kid."
00:16:28.070,00:16:30.114,and you're not the girl in mine.
00:16:31.407,00:16:33.367,But that doesn't make us strangers.
00:16:34.827,00:16:38.080,"Honestly, I think I know you better than most people in real life."
00:16:38.163,00:16:43.419,"I know you're smart and brave, because you take risks to get what you want."
00:16:44.461,00:16:47.923,Maybe we both had expectations that we can never live up to.
00:16:48.007,00:16:50.009,But what we shared was still real.
00:16:51.969,00:16:55.264,The girl I met on the page is the girl I see when I look at you.
00:16:58.308,00:17:00.561,That's the girl I've been falling in love with.
00:17:04.565,00:17:07.609,We could take the bridge and head down Ocean Parkway. Lily?
00:17:09.278,00:17:11.822,I'll be waiting in the place where we began.
00:17:53.697,00:17:54.531,No.
00:17:55.032,00:17:56.325,"No, no, no, no, no."
00:17:56.408,00:17:58.702,This looks like a job for a Christmas elf.
00:17:59.703,00:18:00.913,"Jingle bells, sweetie."
00:19:25.247,00:19:26.832,You gave me New York.
00:19:29.501,00:19:30.335,Yeah.
00:19:31.253,00:19:38.635,"I mean, I couldn't fit the whole city, but… I figured, on your last night, you should at least get one last taste of it."
00:19:40.762,00:19:44.224,How did you even do-- I had a lot of help.
00:19:45.058,00:19:45.934,Yeah.
00:19:47.102,00:19:49.062,"Yeah, for a loner, I have good friends."
00:19:50.564,00:19:52.191,One of them knows a Macy's elf.
00:19:55.694,00:20:00.574,"Um… -Look, I-- -Stop."
00:20:04.536,00:20:05.537,Dash.
00:20:07.331,00:20:10.125,"Oh, why is it so much easier to say something in a book?"
00:20:11.293,00:20:16.965,"I wanna tell you how I feel, but, um… I can't because I've never felt this before."
00:20:17.049,00:20:21.220,"I… I mean, I love my family. I've loved fictional characters."
00:20:21.803,00:20:26.308,"I've loved Spazzy, my gerbil from kindergarten, but this is different."
00:20:53.085,00:20:54.461,What was that?
00:20:56.129,00:20:59.299,"Uh… sometimes, words aren't enough."
00:21:05.264,00:21:06.139,I have to go.
00:21:08.308,00:21:09.142,Fiji.
00:21:17.985,00:21:18.986,"Bye, Grandpa!"
00:21:19.653,00:21:20.612,Don't wait up.
00:21:24.700,00:21:26.201,Does Grandpa know you're here?
00:21:26.702,00:21:27.869,He invited me.
00:21:34.084,00:21:35.585,"I understand, Grandpa."
00:21:36.503,00:21:37.504,Thank you.
00:21:41.591,00:21:42.634,Is everything okay?
00:21:43.677,00:21:44.845,He spoke to my parents.
00:21:46.221,00:21:49.891,"If I wanna stay in New York with him, I can."
00:21:54.062,00:21:55.105,He compromised.
00:21:58.108,00:21:59.067,That's amazing.
00:22:01.778,00:22:03.613,-My parents. -You gonna answer it?
00:22:04.239,00:22:10.120,"I sort of, uh, left them in a cab on the way to Queens, possibly making them miss our international flight."
00:22:12.456,00:22:14.583,I should go… find them.
00:22:15.709,00:22:17.294,And apologize in person.
00:22:25.594,00:22:29.931,Um… Okay. It's not a big deal. We'll just call your cousin Mark.
00:22:30.015,00:22:31.516,-He'll come get us. -He's on a date.
00:22:33.185,00:22:37.314,"Okay, well, we could call your parents or your grandpa."
00:22:38.357,00:22:44.988,"'Cause if you tell them you're trapped in The Strand with me, they'll be happy to send the fire department or the police or the… Army."
00:22:45.072,00:22:45.947,Wait.
00:22:48.075,00:22:49.534,They don't know I'm here.
00:23:05.967,00:23:09.679,I got you a notebook! You can mail it from Puerto Rico!
00:23:13.392,00:23:15.602,Who knew that movie would be so emotional?
00:23:15.685,00:23:17.145,-He's a stapler. -Yeah.
00:23:17.229,00:23:20.941,"She's a piece of paper. He got close, and she got-- Stapled!"
00:23:32.577,00:23:34.538,"Aryn. Hey, babe."
00:23:45.006,00:23:47.300,We could stay trapped a little longer.
00:23:53.473,00:23:54.766,"Happy New Year, Dash."
00:23:56.935,00:23:58.478,"Happy New Year, Lily."
