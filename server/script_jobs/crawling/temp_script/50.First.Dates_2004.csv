00:00:50.300,00:00:52.553,How was Hawaii?
00:00:53.804,00:00:55.430,It was unbelievable.
00:00:55.430,00:00:57.892,"Oh, yeah?"
00:00:57.892,00:00:59.476,I met this guy.
00:00:59.476,00:01:02.187,It was the best week of my life.
00:01:02.187,00:01:05.148,It was just a little vacation romance.
00:01:05.148,00:01:07.275,But he was so sweet...
00:01:07.275,00:01:09.778,He took me to all these cool local places.
00:01:09.778,00:01:12.239,We went scuba diving...
00:01:12.239,00:01:14.825,Snorkeling...
00:01:19.038,00:01:21.999,"Well, we got a little drunk."
00:01:21.999,00:01:24.125,He gave me...
00:01:24.125,00:01:25.586,We slow-danced...
00:01:25.586,00:01:27.086,In the rain.
00:01:27.086,00:01:29.464,But it wasn't just about the sex.
00:01:34.053,00:01:36.013,"You know, it ended kind of weird, though."
00:01:36.013,00:01:38.515,"When I asked for his phone number, he told me..."
00:01:38.515,00:01:39.934,He's married...
00:01:39.934,00:01:41.309,Entering the priesthood...
00:01:41.309,00:01:42.770,He doesn't believe in phones.
00:01:42.770,00:01:44.145,He just kind of...
00:01:44.145,00:01:46.314,ran away.
00:01:46.314,00:01:49.026,"You know, it was just a little fling, but..."
00:01:49.026,00:01:50.736,I will never forget my week...
00:01:50.736,00:01:52.237,With Henry Roth.
00:01:52.237,00:01:53.488,Henry Roth.
00:01:53.488,00:01:55.074,Harry.
00:01:55.074,00:01:57.785,Harry Pairatesticles.
00:01:57.785,00:01:59.995,Henry Roth.
00:01:59.995,00:02:02.456,Henry Roth.
00:02:02.456,00:02:05.834,"Henry Roth, why didn't you tell me you were a secret agent?"
00:02:05.834,00:02:10.714,"I prefer intelligence operative, and I couldn't tell you until I thought I knew you."
00:02:10.714,00:02:12.800,"Well, can I call you when I land?"
00:02:12.800,00:02:14.718,"You can call me, but I'll be in Peru."
00:02:14.718,00:02:16.428,"Ooh, I said that a little loud."
00:02:16.428,00:02:18.138,"Come on, that's a 187."
00:02:18.138,00:02:20.724,Code blue. We got the wolf sleeping at night.
00:02:20.724,00:02:23.769,"He's slipping his right arm in the drawer, and out comes the cookie jar."
00:02:23.769,00:02:25.228,All clear.
00:02:25.228,00:02:27.314,"Bling-blang, walla-walla bing bang. Got it? Zzt."
00:02:27.314,00:02:30.567,"Well, maybe when you get back from Peru."
00:02:30.567,00:02:32.945,"I don't think that's an option, Lisa."
00:02:32.945,00:02:34.237,Linda.
00:02:34.237,00:02:35.572,I know.
00:02:35.572,00:02:37.866,I changed your name for your protection.
00:02:37.866,00:02:39.701,Oh.
00:02:39.701,00:02:41.787,We have to go our separate ways now.
00:02:41.787,00:02:43.038,Well...
00:02:43.038,00:02:44.623,goodbye.
00:02:44.623,00:02:45.958,Got it! Moving out!
00:02:49.628,00:02:50.879,Oh!
00:02:50.879,00:02:52.255,What the hell is your problem?
00:02:52.255,00:02:54.091,"Hey, just keep going."
00:02:54.091,00:02:55.425,You got it.
00:02:55.425,00:02:56.969,How's your balls?
00:02:56.969,00:02:59.387,Killing me.
00:03:13.568,00:03:15.154,"Easy, Honah Lee."
00:03:15.154,00:03:18.740,"Ah! Hey, I'm a person, not a seal, huh?"
00:03:18.740,00:03:23.662,"Well, I am a vet, not a doctor, so just hold still or I won't give you a treat."
00:03:23.662,00:03:25.080,Ow!
00:03:25.080,00:03:26.790,I know. It's okay.
00:03:26.790,00:03:29.168,You see what happens when you play with sharks?
00:03:29.168,00:03:32.171,"Ah! Now, why you got to spread those lies?"
00:03:32.171,00:03:33.881,Sharks are like dogs.
00:03:33.881,00:03:36.675,They only bite when you touch their private parts.
00:03:36.675,00:03:38.760,Okay.
00:03:36.675,00:03:39.970,"Hey, that's a good title for my documentary."
00:03:39.970,00:03:41.680,Sharks...
00:03:41.680,00:03:44.141,They Only Bite When You Touch Their Private Parts.
00:03:44.141,00:03:48.020,HENRY: Or you could call it Sharks... They Tried to Eat My Kidney.
00:03:48.020,00:03:49.396,KIDS: Ha-ha-ha-ha!
00:03:50.731,00:03:51.815,"You too, Willie."
00:03:54.068,00:03:55.485,"All of you, huh?"
00:03:55.485,00:03:57.821,"Ooh, he just cast a spell on us. Whoo!"
00:03:59.156,00:04:02.325,"All right, you're gonna have to put this on four times a day for two weeks."
00:04:02.325,00:04:03.535,You can handle that.
00:04:03.535,00:04:05.079,What's wrong with that turtle?
00:04:05.079,00:04:09.666,"He has lung problems because he smoked too much turtle weed, which is bad for you, right, Ula?"
00:04:09.666,00:04:12.836,What? I don't smoke weed.
00:04:12.836,00:04:14.504,"Quack, quack, quack!"
00:04:14.504,00:04:15.923,Uh-huh.
00:04:15.923,00:04:17.925,"How's that hot wahine nympho from Ohio, huh?"
00:04:17.925,00:04:19.426,"Huh, she's great."
00:04:17.925,00:04:20.802,I dropped her off at the airport this morning.
00:04:20.802,00:04:22.470,"Oh, come on."
00:04:22.470,00:04:25.849,"You get some booby, some assy, a pull on your poi-poi?"
00:04:25.849,00:04:27.726,"Daddy, what's a nympho?"
00:04:27.726,00:04:32.231,Oh. The nympho is the state bird of Ohio.
00:04:32.231,00:04:34.441,ALL: Oh.
00:04:34.441,00:04:36.276,You're the state idiot of Hawaii.
00:04:36.276,00:04:37.527,"There you go, Willie."
00:04:37.527,00:04:40.155,"Bite the fish, chew the fish, love the fish. Yeah, enjoy."
00:04:40.155,00:04:41.531,"You crack me up, kamaaina."
00:04:41.531,00:04:42.741,"Oh, yeah?"
00:04:42.741,00:04:44.367,"You know, one of these days..."
00:04:44.367,00:04:49.248,"You're gonna show one of those tourists such a good time, she'll want to stay on the island, brah."
00:04:49.248,00:04:54.044,"Now, why do you say such mean things to me like that, and why is your foot on my pillow?"
00:04:54.044,00:04:55.295,Mm.
00:04:55.295,00:04:56.880,"I don't want your ass on it, either."
00:04:56.880,00:04:58.339,Get up! Get up.
00:04:58.339,00:05:00.968,It could happen.
00:05:00.968,00:05:03.637,Then you won't be able to go on your big boat trip to Alaska.
00:05:03.637,00:05:08.683,"You'll be stuck here, waking up next to the same old, ugly broad, just like Ula."
00:05:12.604,00:05:14.273,"Just kidding, guys."
00:05:14.273,00:05:16.858,About the old part or the ugly part?
00:05:19.945,00:05:22.781,Henry! Come quickly!
00:05:29.163,00:05:30.956,Jocko!
00:05:32.207,00:05:33.416,Don't be scared.
00:05:33.416,00:05:35.210,Everything's gonna be fine.
00:05:35.210,00:05:37.129,Just stay calm.
00:05:37.129,00:05:40.299,"Willie, I don't need you to see this."
00:05:40.299,00:05:41.967,Get out of here now!
00:05:41.967,00:05:44.803,"Okay, check the temperature of the pool. Go! Hurry!"
00:05:47.514,00:05:49.683,"Alexa, what are you doing?"
00:05:49.683,00:05:51.852,Give me a hand!
00:05:51.852,00:05:53.895,I need you to get me two fish from the barrel.
00:05:53.895,00:05:55.147,Now.
00:05:55.147,00:05:56.648,Just hang in there.
00:05:56.648,00:05:58.233,It's gonna be all right.
00:05:58.233,00:05:59.693,That's a little warm.
00:05:59.693,00:06:01.444,"Go to the bottom of the barrel, please."
00:06:07.701,00:06:09.203,"Okay, there."
00:06:09.203,00:06:10.411,Thank you.
00:06:10.411,00:06:12.331,"Come on, buddy."
00:06:12.331,00:06:14.499,He's not responding!
00:06:14.499,00:06:15.750,Sorry I smacked you with that.
00:06:15.750,00:06:17.044,You needed the fish-slap to calm down.
00:06:17.044,00:06:18.253,Do you understand?
00:06:18.253,00:06:19.546,Yes.
00:06:19.546,00:06:21.923,"Yes, fish-slap calm me."
00:06:21.923,00:06:24.509,"Now, I'm gonna try to get him breathing manually, okay?"
00:06:24.509,00:06:27.137,I need your face right next to his mouth to see if it's working.
00:06:27.137,00:06:28.429,Are you ready?
00:06:28.429,00:06:30.015,"One, two, three!"
00:06:30.015,00:06:31.766,Nothing. Nothing!
00:06:31.766,00:06:33.143,We're gonna try it one more time.
00:06:33.143,00:06:36.355,"If it doesn't work, we'll perform an emergency tracheotomy."
00:06:36.355,00:06:38.815,"We don't want to do that, so let's pray this works."
00:06:38.815,00:06:41.151,One more to three.
00:06:43.320,00:06:45.197,Oh!
00:06:49.868,00:06:51.286,"Yikes. That's, uh..."
00:06:51.286,00:06:52.620,that's a lot of vomit.
00:06:52.620,00:06:55.249,This is why I got into this business.
00:06:55.249,00:06:58.459,To save sea animals.
00:06:58.459,00:07:00.670,"You should go wash yourself off, okay?"
00:07:01.963,00:07:03.257,Maybe try some turpentine.
00:07:03.257,00:07:04.549,That might take the stink away.
00:07:05.926,00:07:08.469,"Yeah, high-five is right, buddy."
00:07:08.469,00:07:12.515,"I knew you were gonna burp, but the vomit thing was awesome!"
00:07:12.515,00:07:15.060,That's what she gets for eating my roast beef sandwich.
00:07:16.519,00:07:17.812,"Willie, did you see that?"
00:07:17.812,00:07:20.481,Whoo!
00:07:38.125,00:07:41.628,"HENRY: Captain's log, November 5th, 6:45 A.M."
00:07:41.628,00:07:45.090,I've taken the Sea Serpent for a trip around the island of Oahu.
00:07:45.090,00:08:05.693,"It is by far the longest voyage she has yet undertaken, and its successful completion will signal that she's ready for our great journey to Bristol Bay, whose unspoiled walrus habitat will yield an abundance of-- Damn it!"
00:08:05.693,00:08:08.696,Are you kidding me?
00:08:28.091,00:08:29.550,"Oh, aloha, honey."
00:08:29.550,00:08:30.927,What can I get for you?
00:08:30.927,00:08:33.596,"Uh, I guess I'll take a cup of coffee."
00:08:33.596,00:08:35.515,You guess?
00:08:35.515,00:08:36.766,"Yeah, I already ate breakfast."
00:08:36.766,00:08:40.270,I just need to kill some time before the Coast Guard gets here to tow my boat.
00:08:40.270,00:08:41.562,What did you eat?
00:08:41.562,00:08:45.525,I had a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup and some Gatorade.
00:08:45.525,00:08:46.985,That not breakfast.
00:08:46.985,00:08:48.736,I'll get you Spam and eggs.
00:08:48.736,00:08:51.281,"Nick, I need Spam and eggs."
00:08:51.281,00:08:52.615,Hey.
00:08:54.326,00:08:55.618,You like the peanut-butter cups?
00:08:55.618,00:08:57.162,"Uh, yes."
00:08:57.162,00:08:59.789,You want for me to put peanut-butter cups in your eggs?
00:08:59.789,00:09:02.125,"No, that's okay."
00:09:02.125,00:09:05.086,Peanut-butter cups.
00:09:22.187,00:09:23.813,"Hey, Sue, nice haircut."
00:09:23.813,00:09:26.941,"Mahalo, Lucy."
00:09:58.348,00:10:00.058,Are you staring at me or her?
00:10:00.058,00:10:02.102,Because you're starting to freak me out.
00:10:02.102,00:10:04.979,"Settle down and eat your pancakes, huh?"
00:10:09.150,00:10:11.652,HENRY: I think she's a local girl.
00:10:11.652,00:10:14.614,"I wanted to go up to her, but I was kind of off my game."
00:10:14.614,00:10:16.866,"Man, oh, man, was she cute, though."
00:10:16.866,00:10:19.286,I thought you liked your bitches from out of state.
00:10:19.286,00:10:21.371,"Yeah, that's usually my policy."
00:10:21.371,00:10:23.081,Make sure I don't get tied down.
00:10:23.081,00:10:24.749,Freeze that image right there.
00:10:26.042,00:10:27.377,There's the little fella.
00:10:27.377,00:10:30.130,"Congratulations, Mommy."
00:10:30.130,00:10:34.675,Sounds to me like someone is afraid of commitment.
00:10:34.675,00:10:35.885,Let me guess.
00:10:35.885,00:10:41.682,"Your high-school sweetheart got drunk at party, then cheated on you with the whole wrestling team."
00:10:41.682,00:10:42.934,Close.
00:10:42.934,00:10:47.021,"Actually, it was my college girlfriend, Tracy, and it wasn't a wrestling team."
00:10:47.021,00:10:48.523,It was her academic advisor.
00:10:48.523,00:10:50.817,"Ah, she liked the older men."
00:10:50.817,00:10:53.111,Older women.
00:10:53.111,00:10:55.363,I hope you shot the stupid tramp.
00:10:55.363,00:10:58.032,What's with the tramp and the bitches talk?
00:10:58.032,00:10:59.534,Are you drunk or something?
00:10:59.534,00:11:01.202,I apologize for nasty talk.
00:11:01.202,00:11:05.248,I am grouchy due to lack of recent physical intimacy.
00:11:05.248,00:11:06.791,Ooh.
00:11:05.248,00:11:08.543,"Shut up, because here comes one-time-only opportunity."
00:11:08.543,00:11:13.423,What I will do now is go into your office and become naked.
00:11:15.258,00:11:17.302,Next move is up to you.
00:11:18.637,00:11:25.977,"I may not be as limber as I once was, but, yeah, I make up for it with enthusiasm and willingness to experiment, huh?"
00:11:27.270,00:11:28.980,I don't know if you realize.
00:11:28.980,00:11:30.398,I'm not into guys.
00:11:49.792,00:11:51.419,"Hey, Mr. Peanut-Butter Cups."
00:11:51.419,00:11:53.547,"Hey, Mr. Could Kill Me In One Punch."
00:11:53.547,00:11:55.382,How you doing?
00:11:55.382,00:11:57.592,"Yeah, couldn't get enough of that Spam."
00:11:57.592,00:11:59.886,Why don't you fry some up and throw some eggs on top?
00:11:59.886,00:12:01.888,You got it.
00:12:01.888,00:12:03.097,"Hi, Lucy."
00:12:03.097,00:12:05.016,"Hi, Nick."
00:12:18.697,00:12:19.947,You know...
00:12:19.947,00:12:21.282,why don't you try this?
00:12:23.368,00:12:25.036,It's kind of a hinge.
00:12:29.624,00:12:30.917,"Now, why didn't I think of that?"
00:12:30.917,00:12:32.919,"Well, you're too close to the project."
00:12:32.919,00:12:34.254,Don't be hard on yourself.
00:12:34.254,00:12:35.796,You're right.
00:12:35.796,00:12:37.507,Sometimes you need an outsider's perspective.
00:12:37.507,00:12:39.467,Fresh eye never hurts.
00:12:41.052,00:12:42.303,I'm Lucy.
00:12:42.303,00:12:44.389,Yes. I'm Henry Roth.
00:12:44.389,00:12:45.973,Nice to meet you.
00:12:45.973,00:12:47.183,It's pretty.
00:12:47.183,00:12:49.686,Keep up the good work.
00:12:49.686,00:12:51.479,Wait.
00:12:51.479,00:12:53.064,I see you're sitting there alone.
00:12:53.064,00:12:55.149,"Um, do you want to come and sit down?"
00:12:55.149,00:13:00.071,"Sure, sure, that'd be great, if that's all right."
00:13:03.283,00:13:04.701,So are you an architect?
00:13:04.701,00:13:06.244,I am not.
00:13:06.244,00:13:09.748,"Oh, that's where the smell is coming from."
00:13:09.748,00:13:16.087,"Yeah, yeah. I was feeding a walrus this morning, and I thought I got most of it off of me, but, uh, guess I didn't."
00:13:16.087,00:13:17.672,I love that smell.
00:13:17.672,00:13:18.965,"No, you don't."
00:13:18.965,00:13:20.508,Fish don't even like that smell.
00:13:20.508,00:13:22.469,"No, I do. My dad's a fisherman."
00:13:22.469,00:13:30.268,"He and my brother, Doug, they go out to sea for months at a time, and I miss them so much while they're gone that when they come back, I..."
00:13:30.268,00:13:34.564,I just hold onto them for five minutes each...
00:13:36.065,00:13:39.402,And they smell just like your hands.
00:13:39.402,00:13:42.863,It's the best smell in the world.
00:13:42.863,00:13:48.077,"Well, my fingers are available for your sniffing pleasure any time you need them."
00:13:48.077,00:13:49.287,Want to?
00:13:49.287,00:13:50.955,Okay.
00:13:50.955,00:13:52.332,Ooh!
00:13:59.547,00:14:05.928,"Sea lions are known for their, uh, athleticism, and dolphins are known for their intelligence."
00:14:05.928,00:14:09.599,"Walruses are known for their, um..."
00:14:09.599,00:14:13.770,Tusks?
00:14:13.770,00:14:16.397,male parts can get pretty gigantic.
00:14:16.397,00:14:17.940,Oh.
00:14:17.940,00:14:19.526,"Yeah, yeah."
00:14:19.526,00:14:21.277,It's the second biggest out of all the mammals.
00:14:21.277,00:14:23.488,What's the first?
00:14:23.488,00:14:25.573,"Uh, I think Tattoo-Face."
00:14:29.744,00:14:31.579,I like your laugh.
00:14:31.579,00:14:34.541,I like you making me laugh.
00:14:34.541,00:14:36.751,"I hate to break this up, but we're setting up for lunch."
00:14:36.751,00:14:38.044,Oh.
00:14:38.044,00:14:39.796,"Sorry, Sue."
00:14:39.796,00:14:44.091,HENRY: And the real cool thing about walruses is they're very mysterious.
00:14:44.091,00:14:46.469,Mysterious?
00:14:44.091,00:14:49.305,"Yeah, yeah. You know, we don't really know what they're like in the wild."
00:14:49.305,00:14:52.475,Don't they just sleep on icebergs and yawn all the time?
00:14:52.475,00:15:00.817,"That's all we really see, is what they do outside of the water, but there hasn't been much research on what they do under the ice, which is where they spend two-thirds of their lives."
00:15:00.817,00:15:05.780,"Well, maybe they're just down there intimidating the other sea creatures with their big winkies."
00:15:05.780,00:15:07.031,That is one theory.
00:15:08.324,00:15:10.410,I'm... I have to go.
00:15:10.410,00:15:11.828,"Uh, where are you going?"
00:15:11.828,00:15:15.623,"It's my dad's birthday, and we go every year and we pick a pineapple."
00:15:15.623,00:15:16.957,It's a tradition.
00:15:16.957,00:15:18.459,That sounds nice.
00:15:18.459,00:15:21.254,"Okay, well, I had a great time."
00:15:21.254,00:15:23.548,Me too.
00:15:23.548,00:15:27.844,"Would you like to have breakfast again tomorrow morning, same time?"
00:15:27.844,00:15:29.596,Because I teach an art class at 10:00.
00:15:29.596,00:15:30.971,"Oh, really?"
00:15:30.971,00:15:32.724,"I wish I could make it, but, uh..."
00:15:32.724,00:15:34.517,"yes, I will be there."
00:15:35.769,00:15:37.019,Take care.
00:15:37.019,00:15:38.271,Okay.
00:15:38.271,00:15:40.064,One for the road.
00:15:40.064,00:15:41.190,"Got you good, eh?"
00:15:41.190,00:15:42.567,Aloha.
00:15:42.567,00:15:43.902,See you tomorrow.
00:15:45.528,00:15:47.781,"Oh, my God."
00:15:47.781,00:15:50.241,"Oh, my goodness."
00:15:56.915,00:15:58.207,Oh!
00:15:59.500,00:16:01.544,Shit.
00:16:03.838,00:16:06.090,"I had a, uh, bee on me."
00:16:06.090,00:16:07.300,All right.
00:16:07.300,00:16:08.593,He was a big one.
00:16:11.846,00:16:15.600,"Which means, Look at those two shitheads."
00:16:22.857,00:16:25.777,That was the stupidest-looking swing I've ever seen.
00:16:25.777,00:16:27.528,I'm gonna take a Molokai on that one.
00:16:28.863,00:16:30.949,No throwing. Come on.
00:16:30.949,00:16:33.785,"Quit your laughing, you hyenas."
00:16:33.785,00:16:35.077,"Okay, you heard me!"
00:16:35.077,00:16:36.329,Go! Go!
00:16:36.329,00:16:38.122,Show Papa what you got.
00:16:48.800,00:16:50.468,You kids suck.
00:16:50.468,00:16:52.428,The Father of the Year strikes again.
00:16:52.428,00:16:57.684,"By the way, cuz, I met this sexy, blonde tax attorney at Starbucks today."
00:16:57.684,00:16:58.893,Uh-huh.
00:16:58.893,00:17:01.980,I told her you the kahuna she want to have fun on this island with.
00:17:01.980,00:17:03.314,Uh-huh.
00:17:03.314,00:17:04.774,You want her number?
00:17:04.774,00:17:06.651,"You pimping tourists for me again, Ula?"
00:17:06.651,00:17:07.986,Yes.
00:17:07.986,00:17:09.529,"I live vicariously through you, remember?"
00:17:09.529,00:17:11.823,My life sucks.
00:17:11.823,00:17:14.325,Give her the Waikikiki sneaky between the cheeky.
00:17:14.325,00:17:16.410,Oh...
00:17:16.410,00:17:19.747,"This way, I can imagine I did it, and then I can get through another weekend."
00:17:19.747,00:17:21.165,I'm staying in.
00:17:21.165,00:17:23.083,"Thank you, though."
00:17:23.083,00:17:26.379,"Hey, Dad!"
00:17:26.379,00:17:28.047,But your stitches are bleeding.
00:17:28.047,00:17:30.257,Oh.
00:17:30.257,00:17:32.468,It must have been my huge backswing.
00:17:32.468,00:17:36.014,"Honah Lee, you think you can stitch me up again tonight after I get back from surfing?"
00:17:36.014,00:17:37.891,"Yeah, looking forward to it."
00:17:37.891,00:17:39.976,I wouldn't surf with a bleeding wound like that.
00:17:39.976,00:17:41.227,You might attract a shark or something.
00:17:41.227,00:17:42.478,"What's wrong with that, cuz?"
00:17:42.478,00:17:43.897,Sharks are naturally peaceful.
00:17:43.897,00:17:45.773,Is that right?
00:17:45.773,00:17:47.274,"How'd you get that nasty cut, anyway?"
00:17:47.274,00:17:48.526,A shark bit me.
00:17:48.526,00:17:49.944,Nice.
00:17:49.944,00:17:51.821,"Go smoke another one, bro."
00:17:51.821,00:17:55.408,"I'll tell you, that shark theory's starting to catch on."
00:17:55.408,00:17:59.078,"Now, will everybody keep it down while I whack the crap out of this thing?"
00:18:04.792,00:18:06.126,HENRY: Sit! Stay!
00:18:06.126,00:18:07.420,Shit! No!
00:18:13.300,00:18:15.511,Where the hell is it?
00:18:15.511,00:18:17.722,LUCY: Looking for something?
00:18:23.686,00:18:25.813,"Oh, my God."
00:18:25.813,00:18:27.440,What are you doing here?
00:18:27.440,00:18:28.942,The same thing you are.
00:18:28.942,00:18:30.693,Looking for my ball.
00:18:30.693,00:18:32.152,This is weird.
00:18:32.152,00:18:33.696,I've been thinking about you all morning.
00:18:33.696,00:18:35.322,All day.
00:18:35.322,00:18:38.284,I can't wait to have breakfast with you again tomorrow.
00:18:38.284,00:18:40.828,"I know, and I just want to eat you up."
00:18:40.828,00:18:42.162,Really?
00:18:42.162,00:18:44.457,"Tomorrow, and the next day..."
00:18:44.457,00:18:45.959,and the next day...
00:18:45.959,00:18:48.294,and the next day...
00:18:48.294,00:18:49.503,"Oh, my."
00:18:49.503,00:18:52.799,"Oh, Lucy, that feels so good."
00:18:52.799,00:18:54.174,No.
00:18:54.174,00:18:56.260,My nipples are too sensitive.
00:18:56.260,00:18:57.553,Stop that.
00:19:02.558,00:19:04.018,What happened?
00:19:04.018,00:19:07.146,"Your ball hooked into that cart, bounced back, and then hit you in the head."
00:19:07.146,00:19:08.773,It was freaking hilarious.
00:19:08.773,00:19:11.275,What?
00:19:11.275,00:19:13.945,And what's up with your nipples?
00:19:15.446,00:19:17.115,I can't be falling for a local.
00:19:17.115,00:19:18.908,I ain't ever going back to that diner.
00:19:18.908,00:19:20.200,This where you got hit?
00:19:20.200,00:19:22.202,Aah! Yes!
00:19:28.459,00:19:31.504,You're so lucky you're a professional cliff diver in Hawaii.
00:19:31.504,00:19:33.255,"Yeah, well, it's a living."
00:19:33.255,00:19:35.424,I'm a tax attorney.
00:19:35.424,00:19:36.759,Is that right?
00:19:36.759,00:19:39.219,I'd like to do something...
00:19:39.219,00:19:42.890,extra fun tonight.
00:19:42.890,00:19:44.433,Uh-oh.
00:19:47.186,00:19:49.814,Mm.
00:19:49.814,00:19:51.357,Mm!
00:19:51.357,00:19:54.652,"Wow, taking it deep, aren't you?"
00:19:56.154,00:19:57.404,Whoo!
00:19:57.404,00:19:59.157,Yeah!
00:19:59.157,00:20:01.200,"Albert, how about another fish bowl for the young lady?"
00:20:01.200,00:20:03.327,Why don't I just tap a keg for her?
00:20:03.327,00:20:04.578,Okay.
00:20:04.578,00:20:07.665,I think I'm getting kind of drunk.
00:20:07.665,00:20:09.333,Are you getting drunk?
00:20:09.333,00:20:10.710,Getting there.
00:20:10.710,00:20:11.919,So...
00:20:11.919,00:20:14.130,what are you thinking?
00:20:19.093,00:20:20.511,What am I thinking?
00:20:23.514,00:20:30.146,"Actually, I'm not drunk at all, Noreen, and neither are you, because there's no alcohol in these drinks."
00:20:30.146,00:20:33.649,"Sadly, I've used this technique many times."
00:20:33.649,00:20:41.991,"It helps lovely tourists such as yourself loosen up without impairing your ability to stay awake all night and have guilt-free, vigorous sex with me."
00:20:41.991,00:20:43.450,Wow.
00:20:43.450,00:20:44.744,I'm sorry.
00:20:44.744,00:20:46.037,"I'm not a cliff diver, either."
00:20:46.037,00:20:47.287,I...
00:20:47.287,00:20:48.664,I'm afraid of heights.
00:20:48.664,00:20:50.624,"Well, since it's my last night in town..."
00:20:50.624,00:20:57.840,can I pretend you didn't just say that and still have sex with you anyway?
00:20:57.840,00:20:59.425,I can't do it.
00:20:59.425,00:21:00.968,I'm sorry.
00:21:00.968,00:21:04.805,"Well, can you at least point me in the direction of someone who can?"
00:21:04.805,00:21:06.140,Uh...
00:21:06.140,00:21:08.392,that guy over there could help you out.
00:21:10.394,00:21:12.188,Isn't that a woman?
00:21:12.188,00:21:13.814,"Jeez, I'm not really sure..."
00:21:16.150,00:21:18.152,"but you're too drunk to notice, remember?"
00:21:18.152,00:21:21.239,Take care.
00:21:29.205,00:21:30.623,"Hey, you."
00:21:30.623,00:21:31.916,Aloha!
00:21:31.916,00:21:34.043,Not aloha hello.
00:21:34.043,00:21:35.335,We're closed today.
00:21:35.335,00:21:36.462,Go away.
00:21:36.462,00:21:37.838,What are you talking about?
00:21:37.838,00:21:39.882,Order up!
00:21:39.882,00:21:41.134,I have to talk to you.
00:21:41.134,00:21:42.384,Okay.
00:21:42.384,00:21:43.677,Hey! Tattoo-Face!
00:21:43.677,00:21:45.179,Hey! Peanut-Butter Cups!
00:21:56.274,00:21:57.858,Hi.
00:21:57.858,00:21:59.735,Hi.
00:21:59.735,00:22:03.281,"My fingers are extra fishy today, if you care to take a whiff."
00:22:03.281,00:22:06.200,What was that?
00:22:06.200,00:22:09.996,I was petting my walrus all morning and I was thinking about you the whole time.
00:22:09.996,00:22:11.664,"Okay, pervert."
00:22:11.664,00:22:13.833,I think that you should leave.
00:22:13.833,00:22:17.544,"What? I was just joking around, because of what we talked about yesterday."
00:22:17.544,00:22:18.921,Yesterday?
00:22:20.214,00:22:22.633,I've never even met you.
00:22:22.633,00:22:24.051,Nick!
00:22:24.051,00:22:26.304,I need help!
00:22:26.304,00:22:28.806,"Nick, put that down."
00:22:28.806,00:22:29.974,"You, follow me."
00:22:29.974,00:22:32.185,Wait...
00:22:32.185,00:22:34.520,I was kidding around with you!
00:22:34.520,00:22:36.022,What happened in there?
00:22:36.022,00:22:38.191,Is she crazy or something?
00:22:38.191,00:22:43.821,"Lucy is a very special person, very different from other people."
00:22:43.821,00:22:45.239,Okay.
00:22:45.239,00:22:49.327,"About a year ago, Lucy was in a terrible car accident."
00:22:49.327,00:22:54.123,She and her father went up North Shore to get a pineapple.
00:23:31.285,00:23:35.206,"Her father broke some ribs, but Lucy suffered a serious head injury."
00:23:35.206,00:23:36.874,She lost her short-term memory.
00:23:36.874,00:23:38.542,Well...
00:23:38.542,00:23:40.544,so she can't remember anything?
00:23:40.544,00:23:41.754,"No, no, no, no."
00:23:41.754,00:23:43.381,She has all of her long-term memory.
00:23:43.381,00:23:45.383,That's a different part of the brain.
00:23:45.383,00:23:49.636,"Her whole life, up to the night before the accident, she remembers."
00:23:49.636,00:23:52.639,She just can't retain any new information.
00:23:52.639,00:23:54.141,It's like...
00:23:54.141,00:23:57.395,her slate gets wiped clean every night while she sleeps.
00:23:57.395,00:23:59.563,Hold on here.
00:23:57.395,00:24:02.191,This sounds like something I would tell a psycho girl so she would stop calling me.
00:24:02.191,00:24:03.734,Am I the psycho girl?
00:24:03.734,00:24:05.111,I wish I was making this up.
00:24:05.111,00:24:08.655,She has no memory that she ever met you.
00:24:08.655,00:24:10.950,What about the pineapple-picking thing?
00:24:10.950,00:24:16.956,"She says that every day, because each morning she wakes up, thinking it's October 13th of last year."
00:24:16.956,00:24:22.295,"She comes here for breakfast, because that's what she did on Sundays, and October 13th was a Sunday."
00:24:22.295,00:24:26.673,She has no idea it's more than a year later.
00:24:26.673,00:24:28.384,"She reads the newspaper, though."
00:24:28.384,00:24:31.429,It's a special paper her father puts on their porch every night.
00:24:31.429,00:24:33.013,It's from the day of her accident.
00:24:33.013,00:24:34.974,He got hundreds of them printed up.
00:24:34.974,00:24:40.062,Lucy does the same thing every day.
00:24:49.529,00:24:51.740,Hello!
00:24:51.740,00:24:53.033,"Hi, Dad."
00:24:53.033,00:24:55.328,"Oh, hi, sweetie."
00:24:55.328,00:24:57.663,You got one without me.
00:24:57.663,00:25:01.917,"Oh. Well, the lady at the farmers' market gave it to me, as a birthday present."
00:25:01.917,00:25:04.253,I didn't want to hurt her feelings.
00:25:04.253,00:25:06.088,Well...
00:25:06.088,00:25:08.424,I think she likes you.
00:25:08.424,00:25:09.883,"Yeah, what's not to like?"
00:25:09.883,00:25:12.052,What about our tradition?
00:25:12.052,00:25:14.013,"Well, I have another idea."
00:25:14.013,00:25:16.265,I painted my workshop yesterday.
00:25:16.265,00:25:17.975,White.
00:25:19.977,00:25:22.229,Now it's too white.
00:25:22.229,00:25:24.357,"Oh, yeah, you definitely need some color in here."
00:25:24.357,00:25:26.859,"Well, you know, that's what I was thinking."
00:25:26.859,00:25:28.277,"Ooh, really?"
00:25:28.277,00:25:29.487,Yeah. Go nuts.
00:25:29.487,00:25:31.655,Paint me something nice for my birthday.
00:25:31.655,00:25:37.244,"I will, and promise that we can pick a pineapple for Thanksgiving, okay?"
00:25:37.244,00:25:39.788,Sounds great.
00:25:39.788,00:25:44.126,"Hey, you should watch the Vikings game while I'm painting."
00:25:44.126,00:25:46.337,Good idea.
00:25:50.299,00:25:51.675,"Yeah, baby."
00:25:51.675,00:25:53.511,Isolate.
00:25:53.511,00:25:54.803,"What are we eating tonight, Doug?"
00:25:54.803,00:25:56.763,"Spaghetti, Pop."
00:25:54.803,00:25:58.140,"Hey, try not to sweat in the sauce."
00:25:58.140,00:25:59.808,"Sorry, Pop."
00:26:07.233,00:26:08.484,"Go, Vikings."
00:26:08.484,00:26:10.610,Seven hundred and five.
00:26:10.610,00:26:11.904,Seven hundred and six.
00:26:11.904,00:26:13.113,Seven hundred and seven.
00:26:13.113,00:26:14.990,"Hey, you guys."
00:26:14.990,00:26:17.159,"Hey, sweetie. How's the painting coming?"
00:26:17.159,00:26:18.660,"Ooh, you'll see."
00:26:18.660,00:26:19.870,Cool.
00:26:19.870,00:26:21.288,Oh. What's the score?
00:26:21.288,00:26:22.831,"Uh, the Vikings are on the two-yard line."
00:26:22.831,00:26:24.708,"If they score here, they bring it to 14-10."
00:26:24.708,00:26:28.128,"Ooh, maybe they'll win for your birthday, Dad."
00:26:28.128,00:26:30.548,And I'll bet Culpepper runs it in.
00:26:30.548,00:26:34.009,I bet he fakes a hand-off to Williams and throws a pass to Kleinsasser.
00:26:34.009,00:26:35.844,Loser does the dishes?
00:26:35.844,00:26:37.679,You're on.
00:26:35.844,00:26:39.139,Looks like they're gonna keep the offense on the field.
00:26:39.139,00:26:41.141,Culpepper fakes a hand-off to Williams.
00:26:41.141,00:26:42.600,He will throw.
00:26:42.600,00:26:44.353,He's got Kleinsasser in the end zone!
00:26:44.353,00:26:45.729,"Touchdown, Minnesota!"
00:26:45.729,00:26:47.398,"Wow, Doug, you're good."
00:26:48.941,00:26:50.317,Maybe you should be a coach.
00:26:53.153,00:26:55.573,Dad!
00:26:55.573,00:26:56.907,Moron.
00:26:56.907,00:26:59.118,That hurt.
00:27:11.671,00:27:13.549,And you don't look a day over 25.
00:27:13.549,00:27:17.136,"Yeah, right, and Doug's muscles aren't pharmaceutically enhanced."
00:27:17.136,00:27:18.720,What are you talking about?
00:27:17.136,00:27:21.348,I use an herb supplement that can be purchased at any health food store.
00:27:21.348,00:27:23.267,Check this out.
00:27:23.267,00:27:24.851,"Rock-hard, baby."
00:27:24.851,00:27:26.979,"Pretty sweet, huh?"
00:27:26.979,00:27:28.397,Stop it!
00:27:28.397,00:27:30.023,You're gonna make me throw up on the cake.
00:27:30.023,00:27:31.233,"Okay, just open your present."
00:27:31.233,00:27:32.526,Okay.
00:27:32.526,00:27:34.528,Let's see what we've got here.
00:27:34.528,00:27:37.531,Oh! The Sixth Sense.
00:27:37.531,00:27:39.366,Hey!
00:27:39.366,00:27:41.577,"When I'm done doing the dishes, do you guys want to watch it?"
00:27:41.577,00:27:43.579,Sure.
00:27:43.579,00:27:46.540,Ben Friedkin?
00:27:46.540,00:27:49.585,"DONNIE WAHLBERG: Some people, they call me freak."
00:27:49.585,00:27:52.129,BRUCE WILLIS: Ronald Sumner?
00:27:52.129,00:27:55.549,I am.
00:27:55.549,00:27:57.050,Look at me.
00:27:57.050,00:28:04.642,Just give me a chance-- I can't believe it.
00:28:04.642,00:28:06.893,Bruce Willis is a ghost!
00:28:06.893,00:28:09.647,I'm just... I'm shocked.
00:28:09.647,00:28:11.524,No.
00:28:11.524,00:28:13.942,"Anyway, it was awesome."
00:28:13.942,00:28:16.028,Happy birthday.
00:28:16.028,00:28:19.990,"Ooh, Doug. Your muscles are getting so big, I can barely wrap my arms around you."
00:28:19.990,00:28:21.992,You like that?
00:28:26.955,00:28:29.249,"Okay, okay, okay."
00:28:29.249,00:28:30.792,Let your sister go to sleep.
00:28:30.792,00:28:33.003,I like it.
00:28:33.003,00:28:35.005,Good night.
00:29:24.137,00:29:25.972,"Hey, Tracy, how you doing?"
00:29:25.972,00:29:27.516,Yeah?
00:29:27.516,00:29:31.645,"Well, things changed a little bit since high school."
00:29:59.965,00:30:03.009,HENRY: And this is what happens every single day.
00:30:03.009,00:30:06.263,ULA: How long it gonna take for her memory to come back?
00:30:06.263,00:30:08.848,Her doctors say it may never come back.
00:30:08.848,00:30:14.938,"So basically, what you're saying is, she's the perfect girl for you."
00:30:14.938,00:30:16.148,What do you mean?
00:30:16.148,00:30:20.277,"You can hang out with her all day with no attachment, because-- Her plane leaves every night?"
00:30:20.277,00:30:21.528,There's only one problem with that.
00:30:21.528,00:30:23.530,What is?
00:30:23.530,00:30:24.782,"No, it isn't."
00:30:24.782,00:30:28.910,"You meet her, hang out, flirt, no commitment, nobody gets hurt."
00:30:28.910,00:30:30.829,"She's got brain damage, you psycho!"
00:30:30.829,00:30:34.416,"Okay, I'll give you that one, but I think it'd be healthy for you, Honah Lee."
00:30:34.416,00:30:37.503,You haven't allowed yourself to connect with a girl for many years.
00:30:37.503,00:30:39.713,"I appreciate your interest, Oprah, but leave me alone."
00:30:39.713,00:30:49.306,"Hey, you'd be doing exactly what her father does-- giving her a wonderful day-- then when it's time for you to go on your big boat trip, poof. You just leave."
00:30:49.306,00:30:51.517,She'd never even know you're gone.
00:30:51.517,00:30:54.812,"See, I'm not sure about the poofing part, because I'm not a very good poofer."
00:30:54.812,00:30:57.481,Could you demonstrate a good poof for me?
00:30:57.481,00:30:59.608,Quit busting my coconuts for five seconds.
00:30:59.608,00:31:03.236,All right. Would you stop poofing on that joint and do some work?
00:31:03.236,00:31:05.364,Okay.
00:31:05.364,00:31:09.618,"Let's get this sucker ready, then we're gonna take her out for a spin."
00:31:12.204,00:31:15.791,"HENRY: Captain's log, November 7th, nearly midnight."
00:31:15.791,00:31:22.464,The Sea Serpent is fully recovered from her mishap and ready to once again brave the open ocean.
00:31:24.758,00:31:27.010,"I think my stitches opened up again, cuz."
00:31:27.010,00:31:28.387,You got a cat?
00:31:28.387,00:31:31.223,Because I feel something licking me.
00:31:41.692,00:31:43.151,How's it?
00:31:43.151,00:31:44.653,Peanut-Butter Cups!
00:31:44.653,00:31:45.904,What are you doing here?
00:31:45.904,00:31:48.948,"I, uh, just wanted to say hi to Lucy."
00:31:49.949,00:31:53.036,I promise you I'm not gonna do anything wrong.
00:31:53.036,00:31:54.329,What did Sue say?
00:31:54.329,00:31:58.124,"She said that if I talk to Lucy, you'll kill me with a meat cleaver."
00:31:58.124,00:32:01.044,"She's the boss, cuz, but don't worry."
00:32:01.044,00:32:03.963,Lucy probably didn't want to talk to you anyway.
00:32:03.963,00:32:06.675,"Um, what does that mean?"
00:32:06.675,00:32:08.218,This ain't a disco.
00:32:08.218,00:32:10.929,She doesn't want guys hitting on her while she has her breakfast.
00:32:10.929,00:32:12.931,Psh.
00:32:12.931,00:32:14.974,Who dat?
00:32:14.974,00:32:18.854,I bet you 20 bucks I can get her to have breakfast with me again.
00:32:21.064,00:32:22.816,You're on.
00:32:22.816,00:32:24.067,I love it.
00:32:24.067,00:32:25.569,"How you doing, honey?"
00:32:25.569,00:32:26.986,"Hey, Sue."
00:32:26.986,00:32:28.739,Nice haircut.
00:32:28.739,00:32:30.115,"Oh, mahalo."
00:32:30.115,00:32:32.534,See you in a bit.
00:32:32.534,00:32:33.911,Nick and I have an arrangement.
00:32:33.911,00:32:36.121,You can trust me.
00:32:36.121,00:32:37.664,Don't worry.
00:32:59.102,00:33:01.563,You should try this out.
00:33:01.563,00:33:02.940,Put it in there.
00:33:02.940,00:33:04.316,Swively door.
00:33:05.818,00:33:07.820,Waffleonians can come in and out now.
00:33:07.820,00:33:13.700,"Oh, are you from a country where it's okay to stick your fingers all over someone else's food?"
00:33:13.700,00:33:17.036,"No, I'm from this country."
00:33:17.036,00:33:19.539,Why? Were you gonna eat that? Oh.
00:33:19.539,00:33:22.041,"All right, well, have a good meal."
00:33:27.172,00:33:28.465,Yeah.
00:33:28.465,00:33:29.842,That was pathetic.
00:33:29.842,00:33:32.385,Yeah? Why don't you choke on your Spam?
00:33:32.385,00:33:34.095,Double or nothing tomorrow.
00:33:41.394,00:33:42.729,Hey.
00:33:42.729,00:33:49.110,"I'm sorry to bother you, but you look like a person who appreciates fine art, so I wanted your opinion on something."
00:33:49.110,00:33:50.403,I drew this.
00:33:50.403,00:33:52.071,"It's a, uh..."
00:33:52.071,00:33:55.617,picture of a father and son fishing off a fishing boat.
00:33:55.617,00:34:00.079,"There's a walrus right there, who, uh-- Huh?"
00:34:01.915,00:34:04.918,"Oh, you don't speak English."
00:34:08.881,00:34:11.550,Doesn't look Chinese.
00:34:11.550,00:34:13.176,Forty!
00:34:15.178,00:34:16.513,Can I have that?
00:34:16.513,00:34:19.016,I need something to wipe my ass with.
00:34:19.016,00:34:21.100,Ha-ha-ha. Shut up.
00:34:46.125,00:34:47.878,I wonder what's the matter with him.
00:34:47.878,00:34:51.339,Looks like a stupid asshole to me.
00:34:58.805,00:34:59.973,Excuse me. Okay.
00:34:59.973,00:35:01.391,I didn't mean to startle you.
00:35:01.391,00:35:03.268,"No, that's all right."
00:35:03.268,00:35:04.644,"Yeah, I'm fine."
00:35:04.644,00:35:06.187,"I'm having a problem with something, but..."
00:35:06.187,00:35:07.814,Is it something that I could help you with?
00:35:07.814,00:35:09.066,"No, no, no."
00:35:09.066,00:35:11.068,I just can't...
00:35:11.068,00:35:14.237,read.
00:35:14.237,00:35:16.531,You got to be kidding me.
00:35:16.531,00:35:18.075,"Here, I can read the menu for you."
00:35:18.075,00:35:19.618,"Oh, no, no, no, no."
00:35:19.618,00:35:22.245,I can do this on my own.
00:35:22.245,00:35:24.748,"I'm gonna get an order of the, uh..."
00:35:31.797,00:35:34.758,Pan... eh...
00:35:34.758,00:35:36.301,cue...
00:35:36.301,00:35:37.594,Pan...
00:35:37.594,00:35:41.556,Pan-ku.
00:35:41.556,00:35:42.849,Pan-ku.
00:35:42.849,00:35:44.726,Kuh...
00:35:44.726,00:35:46.895,Panclocks.
00:35:46.895,00:35:48.229,Pancakes.
00:35:48.229,00:35:49.689,"Okay, I'll have pancake."
00:35:49.689,00:35:51.024,Pancakes.
00:35:49.689,00:35:52.525,Pancah-- Pancakes! Pancakes!
00:35:52.525,00:35:53.902,"Oh, don't cry."
00:35:53.902,00:35:55.112,Stupid! Stupid!
00:35:55.112,00:35:56.321,Stupid! Stupid.
00:35:56.321,00:35:57.614,Don't cry.
00:35:57.614,00:35:59.491,I don't know anything!
00:35:59.491,00:36:00.867,What a loser.
00:36:04.287,00:36:05.538,I'll tell you what.
00:36:05.538,00:36:07.582,Why don't you come over there with me?
00:36:07.582,00:36:10.836,You can have some breakfast and I'll help teach you some of the words.
00:36:10.836,00:36:12.378,Okay.
00:36:12.378,00:36:13.839,LUCY: All right.
00:36:13.839,00:36:15.048,Come on over.
00:36:15.048,00:36:16.382,"Okay, thank you."
00:36:22.430,00:36:27.853,So I comes before the E except after C?
00:36:27.853,00:36:29.104,Yes.
00:36:29.104,00:36:31.940,"Okay, and C is that little half a squiggly one, right?"
00:36:31.940,00:36:33.150,Yes!
00:36:33.150,00:36:34.359,I think I'm getting it.
00:36:34.359,00:36:35.986,How did you get so good at teaching?
00:36:35.986,00:36:38.780,I'm a teacher.
00:36:38.780,00:36:40.991,I'm an art teacher at the Haluki-liki Junior High.
00:36:40.991,00:36:45.537,"Well, you're Haluki-liki the kind of teacher all the kids have crushes on."
00:36:45.537,00:36:47.998,I know I would if I was in your class.
00:36:51.584,00:36:53.628,Okay.
00:36:53.628,00:36:55.254,"Oh, boy, do my..."
00:36:55.254,00:36:56.882,do my fingers smell like fish.
00:36:56.882,00:36:58.383,"That doesn't gross you out, does it?"
00:36:58.383,00:36:59.926,"No, not at all."
00:36:59.926,00:37:02.512,Really?
00:37:02.512,00:37:03.722,Um...
00:37:03.722,00:37:05.057,Ow!
00:37:05.057,00:37:07.976,"If Lucy gets hurt, I'm gonna chop you with the meat cleaver."
00:37:07.976,00:37:10.269,"Okay, okay."
00:37:10.269,00:37:12.981,"HENRY: So, I had a nice time."
00:37:12.981,00:37:14.524,"Yeah, me too."
00:37:14.524,00:37:16.234,Thank you very much.
00:37:16.234,00:37:17.443,Let me get it for you.
00:37:17.443,00:37:18.862,Thank you!
00:37:18.862,00:37:21.031,Okay.
00:37:28.621,00:37:33.793,"I just want to eat you up, tomorrow and the next day, next day... next day..."
00:37:33.793,00:37:36.880,I'll see you around.
00:37:36.880,00:37:38.924,Okay.
00:37:42.094,00:37:44.179,Really? That's it?
00:37:44.179,00:37:45.847,That's what?
00:37:45.847,00:37:53.188,"All that flirting and phony I can't read stuff, and then you're not even gonna ask me out or for my phone number?"
00:37:53.188,00:37:54.439,I can't read.
00:37:54.439,00:37:55.690,"Oh, shut up."
00:37:55.690,00:38:06.618,"That was one of the goofiest things I've ever seen in my life, but I thought, Hey, if this guy is so desperate to meet me, he might be worth talking to, but then I get stiffed."
00:38:06.618,00:38:08.161,"No, no, no, no, this is what happened."
00:38:08.161,00:38:09.287,"I, uh..."
00:38:09.287,00:38:11.790,Mahalo for the ego boost.
00:38:11.790,00:38:13.208,You're right.
00:38:13.208,00:38:15.127,"I feel like, uh..."
00:38:15.127,00:38:16.461,I got to...
00:38:16.461,00:38:17.921,I can read a little!
00:38:17.921,00:38:20.048,I didn't know I came before E!
00:38:20.048,00:38:21.633,"That one I didn't know, I swear."
00:38:21.633,00:38:23.676,"Ah, you idiot!"
00:38:23.676,00:38:26.096,"I hope you're happy, Shamu."
00:38:29.557,00:38:30.767,Marlin.
00:38:30.767,00:38:32.102,It's Sue.
00:38:42.612,00:38:44.739,"Oh, aloha, sir."
00:38:44.739,00:38:48.285,"Uh, my name's Henry-- I know who you are."
00:38:49.786,00:38:51.329,I want to apologize to your daughter.
00:38:51.329,00:38:52.580,Not gonna happen.
00:38:52.580,00:38:53.999,She's inside.
00:38:53.999,00:38:56.293,You and me are gonna straighten some things out.
00:38:56.293,00:38:59.171,"DOUG: Dad, the damn mongoose got in the garbage again!"
00:38:59.171,00:39:02.299,Is this the guy?
00:39:02.299,00:39:03.591,Yeah.
00:39:03.591,00:39:06.011,"Mr. Roth, I have one simple request."
00:39:06.011,00:39:08.013,Stay away from my daughter.
00:39:08.013,00:39:09.306,Absolutely. I just...
00:39:09.306,00:39:12.350,"I think I hurt her feelings, and I don't want it to end like that."
00:39:12.350,00:39:13.810,It's gonna end like this.
00:39:13.810,00:39:15.937,"Calm down, little fella!"
00:39:15.937,00:39:18.106,I'm gonna kill you!
00:39:18.106,00:39:19.482,"Okay, I'm calm."
00:39:19.482,00:39:21.193,I'm calm.
00:39:21.193,00:39:22.443,Let me help you up.
00:39:22.443,00:39:24.362,I got it! I got it.
00:39:24.362,00:39:28.491,It's just that my father and I work too hard to protect Lucy to let some idiot come and ruin it all.
00:39:28.491,00:39:31.911,I know all about what you guys do and I totally respect that.
00:39:31.911,00:39:41.462,"Look, if you know her condition, then you know she can't have a normal relationship with a man, because the next morning, she won't know who he is, and any guy who's okay with that ain't okay with me."
00:39:41.462,00:39:43.631,I'm not looking for a one-night stand.
00:39:43.631,00:39:45.633,"Anything with Lucy is a one-night stand, numb nuts."
00:39:45.633,00:39:48.636,Give us a break. Just stay away from the Hukilau Cafe.
00:39:48.636,00:39:52.182,My daughter's been through enough.
00:39:54.100,00:39:56.019,Okay. I'm sorry.
00:40:00.106,00:40:06.363,"I could have whupped his ass, Daddy, but this gravel, I slipped on it, and-- Yeah, well, maybe you need to do a few more butt-flexes."
00:40:06.363,00:40:08.531,"Cheap shot, Dad."
00:40:08.531,00:40:10.909,So fresh and so clean.
00:40:10.909,00:40:14.913,"Hey, Alexa, did you ever hook up with that girl from the bar the other night?"
00:40:14.913,00:40:17.207,I chickened out.
00:40:17.207,00:40:20.126,I don't know. I guess I prefer sausage to taco.
00:40:21.211,00:40:22.212,What?
00:40:22.212,00:40:24.256,"Yeah, no, I agree, buddy."
00:40:24.256,00:40:27.425,Get out of here.
00:40:27.425,00:40:29.468,"Let me ask you something, Alexa."
00:40:29.468,00:40:34.682,"If you made a promise to a girl's dad that you would not see her anymore, would you consider that, like, a binding promise?"
00:40:34.682,00:40:36.768,Absolutely...
00:40:36.768,00:40:39.562,"But then again, there are always ways around such things."
00:40:39.562,00:40:42.148,Like?
00:40:39.562,00:40:46.111,"For example, if I promised a woman's father I would not see her..."
00:40:46.111,00:40:50.240,I would simply shut my eyes while she serviced my manhood.
00:40:51.616,00:40:53.910,That's actually a cool way to look at it...
00:40:53.910,00:40:55.287,and a very gross way.
00:41:12.137,00:41:15.473,"HENRY: He asked me not to go to the Hukilau, I'm not going to the Hukilau."
00:41:15.473,00:41:17.683,I'm not doing anything wrong.
00:41:24.441,00:41:26.859,Sorry to bother you.
00:41:26.859,00:41:28.111,Uh-oh. Car trouble?
00:41:28.111,00:41:29.362,Yeah.
00:41:29.362,00:41:30.863,You mind giving me a jump?
00:41:30.863,00:41:32.865,Okay.
00:41:32.865,00:41:34.492,Appreciate your time.
00:41:34.492,00:41:36.244,Not everybody would have stopped like you.
00:41:36.244,00:41:37.495,"Oh, yeah."
00:41:37.495,00:41:38.830,Thank you.
00:41:38.830,00:41:39.956,Okay.
00:41:39.956,00:41:42.959,Aaah!
00:41:44.877,00:41:47.839,I can't believe you fell for that.
00:41:47.839,00:41:51.717,My grandfather died trying to jump-start a car.
00:41:53.428,00:41:54.929,Ohh...
00:41:54.929,00:41:56.848,I'm sorry. I...
00:41:56.848,00:41:58.350,I was just joking around.
00:41:58.350,00:42:01.019,I can't believe you fell for that!
00:42:01.019,00:42:02.312,Hah!
00:42:02.312,00:42:03.562,"Oh, my God."
00:42:03.562,00:42:05.898,That was very good.
00:42:05.898,00:42:07.108,My name's Henry.
00:42:07.108,00:42:09.652,I'm Lucy.
00:42:16.117,00:42:18.453,Hi. Sorry for the delay.
00:42:18.453,00:42:19.954,Should be a few minutes.
00:42:19.954,00:42:21.206,No problem. No worries.
00:42:21.206,00:42:22.540,Where are you coming from?
00:42:22.540,00:42:24.000,Breakfast?
00:42:24.000,00:42:25.210,Yeah.
00:42:25.210,00:42:27.128,How was it?
00:42:27.128,00:42:28.296,They were delicious.
00:42:28.296,00:42:30.965,I like making little houses out of waffles.
00:42:30.965,00:42:33.592,You do?
00:42:33.592,00:42:35.512,That's my thing.
00:42:37.430,00:42:38.597,What's your name?
00:42:38.597,00:42:40.225,Lucy.
00:42:40.225,00:42:41.767,"Okay, pal."
00:42:41.767,00:42:43.728,"When she stops, let her pet you, and look cute."
00:42:43.728,00:42:45.604,Go in the middle of the road.
00:42:45.604,00:42:46.772,Right there. Perfect.
00:42:54.489,00:42:56.157,Here she comes. Smile.
00:42:59.327,00:43:00.370,Where is she?
00:43:02.663,00:43:04.957,Uh-oh.
00:43:04.957,00:43:06.334,"Oh, my..."
00:43:08.253,00:43:10.338,Okay. That didn't work.
00:43:10.338,00:43:12.131,Shit your pants?
00:43:12.131,00:43:13.466,So did I.
00:43:18.513,00:43:19.805,"Okay, this is her."
00:43:19.805,00:43:21.807,"Start beating me up, and make it look good."
00:43:23.518,00:43:25.770,Ow! Ow!
00:43:25.770,00:43:27.813,Give me your wallet!
00:43:27.813,00:43:29.190,"Okay, haole, what do you think?"
00:43:29.190,00:43:33.236,"You can come to this island, eat our pineapple-- Help me! Ow!"
00:43:33.236,00:43:35.280,Not so hard. Take it easy.
00:43:35.280,00:43:37.031,Trying to bang our women!
00:43:37.031,00:43:38.908,Making my sister clean your hotel room!
00:43:38.908,00:43:40.577,Okay. What does that have to do with this?
00:43:40.577,00:43:41.827,Relax.
00:43:41.827,00:43:43.037,"Hey! Hey! Help me, please!"
00:43:43.037,00:43:44.414,Stupid haole!
00:43:45.748,00:43:47.542,"Yeah, that's right."
00:43:47.542,00:43:51.045,And that!
00:43:51.045,00:43:53.423,You got him! Enough!
00:43:53.423,00:43:55.007,"Yes, he-- Okay, I'll be right back."
00:43:55.007,00:43:56.551,Hey! Come here!
00:43:56.551,00:43:57.927,I think he's had enough!
00:43:57.927,00:43:59.929,Aw. I'm sorry!
00:43:59.929,00:44:02.265,ULA: My eye!
00:44:04.267,00:44:05.560,You got him!
00:44:05.560,00:44:06.769,Not good enough!
00:44:06.769,00:44:08.146,"ULA: Oh, Kamehameha!"
00:44:08.146,00:44:10.356,He learned his lesson!
00:44:10.356,00:44:12.817,What's your name?
00:44:12.817,00:44:15.194,You did good.
00:44:15.194,00:44:19.574,"I'm in a community watch program, and-- Oh, you crazy bitch!"
00:44:19.574,00:44:21.033,"Yeah, keep running!"
00:44:21.033,00:44:23.161,"Okay, okay, he's..."
00:44:30.126,00:44:32.253,Not her. False alarm.
00:44:35.507,00:44:37.675,"Don't worry, I called the cops already."
00:44:37.675,00:44:39.135,I'm all set.
00:44:39.135,00:44:41.971,"DOUG: Yeah? You all set for this, Mr. Smarty?"
00:44:44.390,00:44:46.434,Oh... shit.
00:44:46.434,00:44:51.564,"Yeah, well, when you're finished playing your little kidnap-victim crap on my daughter, come by the house."
00:44:51.564,00:44:53.483,Okay.
00:45:01.907,00:45:03.409,"Oh, boy."
00:45:10.542,00:45:12.460,There's something I want to show you.
00:45:14.003,00:45:23.429,LUCY: We figured it out.
00:45:23.429,00:45:25.223,She only sings on days she meets you.
00:45:25.223,00:45:27.058,You're kidding me.
00:45:27.058,00:45:28.226,Mm-hmm.
00:45:28.226,00:45:29.602,That was Mom and Dad's song.
00:45:29.602,00:45:34.982,"When her mother was alive, Lucy would have me take that Beach Boys tape on every fishing trip I went on."
00:45:34.982,00:45:36.359,"Oh, yeah?"
00:45:34.982,00:45:40.071,"Yeah, she knew it would make me miss her mom and want to come home that much sooner."
00:45:40.071,00:45:41.864,"I'm seeing a whole new side to you, sir."
00:45:41.864,00:45:43.866,"I got to tell you, it's grossing me out."
00:45:45.826,00:45:47.620,Let me ask you something.
00:45:47.620,00:45:49.163,What's in it for you?
00:45:49.163,00:45:50.915,What do you get out of this?
00:45:52.291,00:45:53.876,I don't know...
00:45:58.755,00:46:01.634,But wouldn't you want to spend an hour a day with that?
00:46:01.634,00:46:02.885,"Actually, no."
00:46:02.885,00:46:04.136,She sings like shit.
00:46:04.136,00:46:06.013,What?
00:46:06.013,00:46:07.390,Can I ask you guys something?
00:46:07.390,00:46:09.225,What's gonna happen down the line?
00:46:09.225,00:46:13.812,"Some day, she's gonna wake up and look in the mirror and notice her face has aged 10 years overnight."
00:46:13.812,00:46:15.147,"You know something, Henry?"
00:46:15.147,00:46:19.110,I worry about that every damn day of my life.
00:46:23.864,00:46:33.874,"Pardon me. I'm sorry to interrupt, but I noticed we were both eating alone, and I thought perhaps I could sit with you, build a syrup Jacuzzi for your waffle house."
00:46:33.874,00:46:37.169,"Oh, that would be nice, but I..."
00:46:37.169,00:46:38.921,"have a boyfriend, so..."
00:46:38.921,00:46:41.132,I'm sorry.
00:46:41.132,00:46:44.885,You're making up a boyfriend so you can get rid of me?
00:46:44.885,00:46:46.429,"No, I'm not."
00:46:46.429,00:46:47.804,"What's his name, then?"
00:46:47.804,00:46:50.141,Ringo.
00:46:50.141,00:46:52.435,Is his last name Starr?
00:46:52.435,00:46:54.479,No. McCartney.
00:46:54.479,00:46:55.812,"McCartney, okay."
00:46:55.812,00:46:57.649,"Oh, no!"
00:46:57.649,00:47:00.276,All right. I'm sorry.
00:47:00.276,00:47:01.986,"Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:47:01.986,00:47:03.738,I wouldn't go out there.
00:47:03.738,00:47:06.031,Go on!
00:47:06.031,00:47:07.408,The tags don't expire for seven months.
00:47:07.408,00:47:09.994,They expired May of this year.
00:47:09.994,00:47:11.245,"No! No, no."
00:47:11.245,00:47:12.913,They expire May of next year.
00:47:12.913,00:47:15.040,"Officer, I think there's been a misunderstanding."
00:47:15.040,00:47:16.959,I don't.
00:47:16.959,00:47:18.252,I'm not paying for this!
00:47:18.252,00:47:20.755,It's October! Excuse me.
00:47:20.755,00:47:22.047,"Look, October!"
00:47:22.047,00:47:23.466,"Uh, Lucy, let's go back inside."
00:47:25.718,00:47:27.970,What?
00:47:36.853,00:47:38.356,What?
00:47:44.612,00:47:46.405,"Having a bad day, Doug!"
00:48:28.489,00:48:29.657,Sweetheart...
00:48:29.657,00:48:32.702,these are from the accident.
00:48:49.468,00:48:53.723,"Oh, no!"
00:48:59.353,00:49:01.731,I can feel it.
00:49:04.734,00:49:08.404,"You were in the hospital for three months, sweetheart."
00:49:21.208,00:49:23.335,I have to talk to this doctor.
00:49:23.335,00:49:25.212,I need to hear it from him.
00:49:25.212,00:49:27.506,"You have heard it, sweetie."
00:49:29.467,00:49:30.843,I have?
00:49:32.136,00:49:33.471,I'll take her.
00:49:35.890,00:49:38.100,"I, uh, have to hear it for myself too."
00:49:48.444,00:49:50.070,"Doug, just take this, okay?"
00:49:50.070,00:49:51.280,I can't...
00:49:51.280,00:49:53.198,I can't look at it anymore.
00:49:53.198,00:49:55.493,"It's gonna be all right, Luce."
00:49:55.493,00:49:56.744,Don't call me Luce.
00:49:56.744,00:49:58.120,I barely know you.
00:49:58.120,00:50:00.372,"Sweetie, you're sort of dating him."
00:50:00.372,00:50:01.624,But I...
00:50:01.624,00:50:04.460,Sorry I'm not better looking.
00:50:06.170,00:50:08.881,"Well, what else happened since last October?"
00:50:08.881,00:50:11.091,What about my students?
00:50:11.091,00:50:13.093,"Uh, Miss Campbell took over your class."
00:50:15.805,00:50:19.057,Did Alicia marry that guy?
00:50:19.057,00:50:21.519,"Doug, did you win the Mr. Hawaii contest?"
00:50:21.519,00:50:23.980,I didn't know there was gonna be a urine test.
00:50:23.980,00:50:25.773,Wow.
00:50:25.773,00:50:28.233,Do we have sex?
00:50:29.652,00:50:33.865,"No, we don't, just so everybody knows that."
00:50:34.615,00:50:35.992,We want to.
00:50:36.993,00:50:39.161,Just kidding.
00:50:42.581,00:50:45.793,So you guys have to just lie to me every day.
00:50:59.891,00:51:01.141,"Hey, Lucy."
00:51:01.141,00:51:02.476,Good to see you again.
00:51:04.896,00:51:06.939,What the hell's her problem?
00:51:06.939,00:51:10.108,"She doesn't remember who you are, brah."
00:51:10.108,00:51:11.694,"Oh, yeah."
00:51:11.694,00:51:15.656,I suck at this job.
00:51:15.656,00:51:17.491,"All right, Lucy."
00:51:17.491,00:51:19.075,These are your brain scans here.
00:51:19.075,00:51:20.452,I'm afraid they show no improvement.
00:51:20.452,00:51:30.462,"The temporal lobe was severely damaged in the accident, but what we believe is the scar tissue here is impairing your ability to convert short-term memory into long-term memory while you sleep."
00:51:30.462,00:51:33.465,The condition has come to be known as Goldfield Syndrome.
00:51:33.465,00:51:35.091,"Uh, who's Goldfield?"
00:51:35.091,00:51:36.886,A brilliant Lithuanian psychiatrist.
00:51:36.886,00:51:39.388,"Uh, he himself suffered temporal lobe damage."
00:51:39.388,00:51:44.435,"It took him four years to publish his findings, because he had to keep starting over from scratch."
00:51:44.435,00:51:47.479,"Obviously your sense of humor is still intact, and that's..."
00:51:47.479,00:51:48.773,that's here.
00:51:48.773,00:51:49.982,Magnificent amygdala as well.
00:51:49.982,00:51:51.483,"Doctor, I have a question."
00:51:51.483,00:51:57.364,"Yes, Douglas, I'd be happy to answer it, but as I've told you several times, this is a hygienic facility and shirts are required in the office."
00:51:57.364,00:51:59.575,"Oh, okay."
00:52:01.452,00:52:09.167,"Um, listen, doctor, this... friend of mine's been experimenting a little with steroids, and, uh, he's been having a lot of wet dreams."
00:52:09.167,00:52:11.587,Could there be a connection between those two?
00:52:11.587,00:52:20.178,"Douglas, get off the juice, and as far as the nocturnal emissions, why don't you take a swim, buy a shirt with no holes in it, find a beautiful wahine and take her to dinner?"
00:52:20.178,00:52:23.099,I'll tell my friend you said so.
00:52:23.099,00:52:24.892,"In any case, Lucy..."
00:52:24.892,00:52:28.479,your condition is stable but most likely permanent.
00:52:28.479,00:52:32.900,"I'm so sorry, dear, but it could be worse."
00:52:32.900,00:52:35.861,Yeah? How?
00:52:35.861,00:52:38.781,I think you should meet Ten Second Tom.
00:52:38.781,00:52:42.910,Callahan Institute is the leading brain-injury clinic in the Pacific Rim.
00:52:42.910,00:52:50.459,"We are funded out of Sandusky, Ohio by T.B. Callahan, the automotive components tycoon and philanthropist."
00:52:54.630,00:52:59.802,"And now, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce to you our most distinguished clinical subject..."
00:52:59.802,00:53:01.095,Tom.
00:53:01.095,00:53:03.639,Hi. I'm Tom.
00:53:03.639,00:53:04.932,Marlin.
00:53:04.932,00:53:06.433,Lucy.
00:53:06.433,00:53:07.810,"Oh, those are cool flip-flops."
00:53:07.810,00:53:10.062,Where'd you get them?
00:53:10.062,00:53:12.356,It's an interesting story.
00:53:12.356,00:53:15.067,Huh? Oh. Henry.
00:53:15.067,00:53:17.069,Hi.
00:53:17.069,00:53:19.530,Tom lost part of his brain in a hunting accident.
00:53:19.530,00:53:20.865,His memory only lasts 10 seconds.
00:53:20.865,00:53:23.117,I was in an accident?
00:53:23.117,00:53:24.451,Don't worry.
00:53:23.117,00:53:26.162,You'll totally get over it in about three seconds.
00:53:26.162,00:53:27.579,Get over it?
00:53:27.579,00:53:29.165,Did I get shot in the brain?
00:53:29.165,00:53:31.333,"Hi, I'm Tom."
00:53:31.333,00:53:32.543,Hi.
00:53:32.543,00:53:34.837,Doug.
00:53:34.837,00:53:36.338,"Hey, Tom, can I tell you a secret?"
00:53:39.383,00:53:42.678,Don't you think you're a little old to still have wet dreams?
00:53:45.514,00:53:47.725,They liked that.
00:53:47.725,00:53:49.060,"Hi, I'm Tom."
00:53:49.060,00:53:50.352,"Yeah, watch yourself, Tom."
00:53:50.352,00:53:51.687,Easy.
00:54:05.159,00:54:06.618,"Okay, well, I'm gonna go to sleep."
00:54:06.618,00:54:08.787,All right.
00:54:08.787,00:54:11.456,"Good night, you guys."
00:54:11.456,00:54:13.751,and I guess I'll see you too.
00:54:13.751,00:54:15.086,"Oh, yeah."
00:54:15.086,00:54:17.922,You had a rough day today.
00:54:17.922,00:54:19.423,I hope you get some rest tonight.
00:54:19.423,00:54:22.093,Okay.
00:54:22.093,00:54:23.552,Good night.
00:54:23.552,00:54:25.054,"DOUG: So, hotshot, how you getting home?"
00:54:25.054,00:54:27.472,You gonna take the Likelike or-- Hey.
00:54:28.432,00:54:29.850,Um...
00:54:29.850,00:54:32.853,thank you for being so nice to me today.
00:54:32.853,00:54:34.354,Sure.
00:54:34.354,00:54:35.981,I don't want you to...
00:54:35.981,00:54:39.484,"strike out tomorrow, so maybe you could talk to me about..."
00:54:39.484,00:54:41.486,lilies.
00:54:41.486,00:54:43.114,Lilies?
00:54:43.114,00:54:44.990,I'm a sucker for lilies.
00:54:44.990,00:54:46.951,Thanks for the tip.
00:54:46.951,00:54:48.619,Good night.
00:54:48.619,00:54:50.495,Good night.
00:54:50.495,00:54:52.706,"My, oh, my."
00:54:52.706,00:54:55.167,Lover-boy.
00:54:55.167,00:54:57.253,"If you don't have to rush off, stick around."
00:54:57.253,00:55:01.257,You've earned yourself a couple of beers.
00:55:01.257,00:55:03.508,"MARLIN: So, what are your plans when you finish your boat?"
00:55:03.508,00:55:08.304,"HENRY: Actually, I'm going on a trip in a little while to study undersea Pacific walrus behaviors."
00:55:08.304,00:55:09.723,Sounds kind of fruity.
00:55:09.723,00:55:12.143,Thank you.
00:55:12.143,00:55:13.602,"Uh, about a year."
00:55:13.602,00:55:15.479,I guess you won't miss days like this.
00:55:15.479,00:55:18.941,"Well, maybe days like this don't have to be so bad."
00:55:18.941,00:55:20.943,What are you trying to say?
00:55:20.943,00:55:29.743,"Well, when you guys tell her, she's not just finding out about the accident, she's finding out that her life is basically a setup."
00:55:29.743,00:55:31.829,I think that's what freaks her out the most.
00:55:31.829,00:55:33.413,"What, you're an expert now?"
00:55:33.413,00:55:38.043,"No. I'm just saying I wish there was another way besides, Sorry we couldn't trick you today."
00:55:38.043,00:55:39.878,Here's some pictures of your broken head.
00:55:39.878,00:55:41.463,You want a broken head?
00:55:41.463,00:55:42.881,"Why, you gonna give it to him?"
00:55:42.881,00:55:45.884,"No, Daddy, I thought you was gonna do it."
00:55:45.884,00:55:47.261,"Nobody's gotta break my head, guys."
00:55:47.261,00:55:48.887,I'm gonna split anyways.
00:55:48.887,00:55:50.388,"Oh, don't go just because my thon is thychotic."
00:55:50.388,00:55:52.683,Good night. Sweet dreams.
00:55:52.683,00:55:54.143,"Keep 'em dry there, Doug."
00:55:54.143,00:55:56.478,Very funny.
00:56:16.748,00:56:18.542,Excuse me.
00:56:18.542,00:56:20.961,Lucy Whitmore?
00:56:20.961,00:56:22.254,I have a delivery for you.
00:56:22.254,00:56:24.340,A delivery for me?
00:56:24.340,00:56:25.674,Yes.
00:56:27.218,00:56:28.927,"Oh, they're beautiful."
00:56:28.927,00:56:30.137,Mm.
00:56:30.137,00:56:31.805,Who are they from?
00:56:31.805,00:56:34.141,That I can't tell you.
00:56:34.141,00:56:37.144,He also wants you to have this.
00:56:37.144,00:56:38.520,"Who's your friend, Lucy?"
00:56:38.520,00:56:40.605,"Oh, well, I mean, I don't know."
00:56:40.605,00:56:43.108,"We just met, but look."
00:56:43.108,00:56:45.944,I have a secret admirer.
00:56:45.944,00:56:48.030,"Oh, really? What's this?"
00:56:48.030,00:56:49.740,It's a videotape.
00:56:49.740,00:56:51.616,A videotape of what?
00:56:51.616,00:56:56.330,"I have no idea, but I have to find out."
00:56:56.330,00:56:57.581,Oh!
00:56:57.581,00:56:59.333,"Happy birthday, Daddy."
00:56:59.333,00:57:00.625,"Thank you, sweetie."
00:57:00.625,00:57:02.044,That's right.
00:57:02.044,00:57:04.004,"What are you, 200 today?"
00:57:04.004,00:57:05.547,"What the hell are you doing, Henry?"
00:57:05.547,00:57:07.341,I just wanted to try something different.
00:57:07.341,00:57:09.885,"If it doesn't work, we've only wasted one day, so..."
00:57:29.321,00:57:31.698,Martha Stewart was in New York today to face charges...
00:57:33.325,00:57:35.160,"Oh, God!"
00:58:15.826,00:58:17.828,"ULA: Okay, I think it's on."
00:58:17.828,00:58:20.164,Aloha. I'm Henry Roth.
00:58:20.164,00:58:25.502,We met here at the Hukilau Cafe about a year after your accident.
00:58:25.502,00:58:28.297,"Um, I like you and you like me..."
00:58:28.297,00:58:29.423,most days.
00:58:29.423,00:58:33.677,"Every day is different, but basically this is what happens, Lucy."
00:58:33.677,00:58:35.053,"Kikomokakau, take the camera."
00:58:35.053,00:58:37.139,"Okay, I got it, Dad."
00:58:37.139,00:58:38.723,"Okay, all right."
00:58:38.723,00:58:42.727,"Uh, the part of you in this reenactment will be played by my good friend, Ula."
00:58:44.480,00:58:45.730,Aloha.
00:58:45.730,00:58:47.232,Sorry about your brain.
00:58:47.232,00:58:48.984,I had a accident too.
00:58:48.984,00:58:52.029,"Believe it or not, this my good eye."
00:58:52.029,00:58:54.281,HENRY: We ready?
00:58:54.281,00:58:55.866,Hi.
00:58:55.866,00:58:57.951,I like that waffle teepee that you have built.
00:58:57.951,00:58:59.161,Oh.
00:58:59.161,00:59:00.412,So nice of you to notice.
00:59:00.412,00:59:02.414,"Please, sit down."
00:59:02.414,00:59:04.875,I would love to.
00:59:04.875,00:59:07.211,"My name is Henry, by the way."
00:59:07.211,00:59:08.462,My name is Lucy.
00:59:08.462,00:59:09.838,Smell my fingers?
00:59:11.548,00:59:13.967,"Ooh, fish. Right on."
00:59:13.967,00:59:17.762,"So, Lucy, I work at an aquarium."
00:59:17.762,00:59:20.098,Aquariums make me super horny.
00:59:20.098,00:59:21.392,That's not funny.
00:59:21.392,00:59:23.143,Don't rub those.
00:59:23.143,00:59:24.728,"I'm sorry, Mr. Whitmore, if you're watching."
00:59:24.728,00:59:27.523,It's late. My friend is unstable.
00:59:27.523,00:59:29.733,"Aw, come on, stop with the licking!"
00:59:29.733,00:59:31.568,You're making me sick!
00:59:31.568,00:59:33.111,"Lucy, I'm sorry."
00:59:33.111,00:59:36.573,"Anyways, I know you wish I was making all this stuff up."
00:59:36.573,00:59:44.373,"I wish I was too, but the good news is, there's so many people out there who care about you."
00:59:44.373,00:59:49.920,Your dad and Doug and a couple of your friends here at the Hukilau who have a message for you.
00:59:49.920,00:59:53.257,"SUE: Lucy, as you know, your mother and I were best friends."
00:59:53.257,00:59:59.221,That's why I promised her that I would always help look after you.
01:00:01.014,01:00:03.892,"Sometimes, life isn't very fair..."
01:00:03.892,01:00:06.686,but we still have you.
01:00:08.646,01:00:16.363,"Oh, and if you were wondering, uh, uh, about this guy who's making this, uh, tape, he's okay."
01:00:16.363,01:00:22.369,"Hey, Lucy! Just so you know, since you lost your memory, I became Governor of Hawaii."
01:00:22.369,01:00:24.496,"Nah, just kidding."
01:00:24.496,01:00:25.830,I'm too smart.
01:00:28.417,01:00:29.793,Kualaliku!
01:00:29.793,01:00:31.962,Get your brother off the dishwasher!
01:00:31.962,01:00:39.970,"Uh, so whenever you're ready, we'd all love to talk to you and answer any questions you have, and you're the best, Lucy."
01:00:39.970,01:00:41.305,Aloha.
01:00:55.652,01:00:58.447,How many times have I watched this?
01:00:58.447,01:01:00.574,"Uh, this is the first time."
01:01:05.662,01:01:07.372,"HENRY: Okay, she cried for about an hour."
01:01:07.372,01:01:08.665,That's not too bad.
01:01:08.665,01:01:13.670,"I bet in another hour she'll be ready to see her friends, have some lunch, get her life back."
01:01:13.670,01:01:15.880,We could do this every day.
01:01:18.675,01:01:20.051,We'll leave it up to her.
01:01:20.051,01:01:22.304,All right.
01:01:24.889,01:01:27.809,So how's the cow?
01:01:27.809,01:01:28.977,Same as you.
01:01:28.977,01:01:31.605,"Every day, they have to convince her she's a cow."
01:01:34.858,01:01:36.734,"LUCY: Wow, look."
01:01:36.734,01:01:38.362,The bark is healing.
01:01:38.362,01:01:40.864,HENRY: You're gonna get there.
01:01:40.864,01:01:43.741,I never hung out with you in the afternoon like this.
01:01:43.741,01:01:46.370,"In this lighting, man, oh, man, you look..."
01:01:46.370,01:01:49.164,disgusting.
01:01:49.164,01:01:51.041,Yeah.
01:01:51.041,01:01:55.420,"Well, I don't know how you get me to fall for that egg-shaped head every morning."
01:01:55.420,01:02:00.967,"Oh, all I have to do is slide on my designer jeans and just kind of wiggle in front of you."
01:02:00.967,01:02:02.969,You go nuts!
01:02:02.969,01:02:07.432,Why couldn't I have met you one day before the accident?
01:02:07.432,01:02:13.480,"Don't worry, because if you hung out with me for more than one day, you'd realize I'm a bore."
01:02:13.480,01:02:15.649,"Oh, well, I have news for you."
01:02:15.649,01:02:16.900,Yes?
01:02:16.900,01:02:18.443,It takes less than one day.
01:02:18.443,01:02:20.904,You know something?
01:02:20.904,01:02:24.991,"Your damaged temporal lobe is causing me pain, and I'm gonna get you for that."
01:02:24.991,01:02:26.284,Hoo!
01:02:27.494,01:02:29.871,Now you're dead!
01:02:47.055,01:02:49.600,I can't believe you're pregnant.
01:02:49.600,01:02:50.808,I know.
01:02:50.808,01:02:52.477,And I got her on the first try.
01:02:52.477,01:02:54.020,Yeah. Easy.
01:02:54.020,01:02:55.980,"And, Tammy, you are so thin."
01:02:55.980,01:02:57.441,"Thanks, Luce."
01:02:57.441,01:03:01.319,"And I'm so glad that you finally got that gender reassignment surgery, Jennifer."
01:03:01.319,01:03:02.820,"I mean, Jonathan."
01:03:02.820,01:03:05.657,Mahalo.
01:03:05.657,01:03:06.824,"Here you go, Lucy."
01:03:06.824,01:03:08.159,Thank you.
01:03:08.159,01:03:10.828,"So, you must be Lucy's friend, the one who made the tape."
01:03:10.828,01:03:13.039,I think he's more than my friend.
01:03:13.039,01:03:14.666,"You're my boyfriend, right?"
01:03:14.666,01:03:15.959,"Yes, ma'am."
01:03:15.959,01:03:23.841,"So, every day, you help her to realize what happened, and you wait patiently for her to be okay with it, then you get her to fall in love with you again?"
01:03:23.841,01:03:25.427,"Yes, ma'am."
01:03:25.427,01:03:26.844,Gosh. You asshole.
01:03:26.844,01:03:30.641,You don't even open the frickin' car door for me anymore.
01:03:31.849,01:03:34.311,You're in trouble!
01:03:34.311,01:03:36.480,I got to go tinkle.
01:03:36.480,01:03:38.940,Oh.
01:03:40.358,01:03:44.237,"Okay, so tell me a little bit more about yourself."
01:03:44.237,01:03:46.364,"Okay. Well, I've..."
01:03:46.364,01:03:49.743,won over seven all-you-can-eat chicken wing contests.
01:03:49.743,01:03:52.036,Really?
01:03:52.036,01:03:54.414,"And I'm a ballet dancer, but only in my bathroom."
01:03:55.791,01:03:57.292,"No, what do you want to know?"
01:03:57.292,01:03:59.085,Um...
01:03:59.085,01:04:01.463,do you love me?
01:04:03.173,01:04:05.383,Hmm.
01:04:03.173,01:04:07.010,I didn't mean to put you on the spot or anything.
01:04:07.010,01:04:09.262,I was just asking more for informational purposes.
01:04:09.262,01:04:11.473,It's to keep the video up-to-date as possible.
01:04:11.473,01:04:12.724,Sure.
01:04:14.184,01:04:18.104,"Well, love is a very loaded word."
01:04:18.104,01:04:19.731,Hmm.
01:04:19.731,01:04:22.233,"Uh, let's see."
01:04:22.233,01:04:23.943,"I, uh..."
01:04:23.943,01:04:31.868,"I go to this restaurant every morning, and I see you there, reading, and..."
01:04:31.868,01:04:36.414,I love you very much.
01:04:36.414,01:04:39.917,Probably more than anybody could love another person.
01:04:39.917,01:04:41.503,Wow...
01:04:43.296,01:04:46.466,And how do I feel about you?
01:04:46.466,01:04:51.513,"You're excited about the chicken-wing thing, and, uh..."
01:04:51.513,01:04:55.767,you've been dying to make out with me for quite some time now.
01:05:07.111,01:05:08.822,Feeling better now?
01:05:08.822,01:05:11.949,Nothing beats a first kiss.
01:05:19.916,01:05:22.377,There's nothing like a first kiss.
01:05:45.233,01:05:47.527,Nothing beats a first kiss.
01:05:47.527,01:05:49.237,That's what I've heard.
01:05:53.867,01:06:08.381,Nothing beats a first-- Mm! What are you doing?
01:06:08.381,01:06:09.716,Nothing.
01:06:09.716,01:06:11.885,I was just getting some lint off for you.
01:06:11.885,01:06:13.970,You were going for a feelski.
01:06:13.970,01:06:19.225,"All right, I'm sorry, but this is, like, the 23rd time we've made out already, and..."
01:06:19.225,01:06:20.769,they're getting blue.
01:06:20.769,01:06:23.271,I know. I know.
01:06:23.271,01:06:26.858,"I mean, I really don't know."
01:06:26.858,01:06:30.111,"For me, it still feels like the first time."
01:06:30.111,01:06:31.988,"Okay, let's average it out then."
01:06:31.988,01:06:34.866,It's the 23rd time for me and the first time for you.
01:06:34.866,01:06:36.618,That's about our 12th time.
01:06:36.618,01:06:37.786,Yeah?
01:06:37.786,01:06:42.916,"Now, Hawaiian law clearly states after the 12th date I'm entitled to unlimited boob access."
01:06:44.167,01:06:48.379,Why didn't I meet you one day before the accident?
01:06:49.923,01:06:52.091,You say that all the time.
01:06:52.091,01:06:54.970,You want to meet a friend of mine?
01:06:58.515,01:07:00.433,All right.
01:07:00.433,01:07:02.978,"Jocko, this is Lucy."
01:07:02.978,01:07:05.271,"Lucy, this is Jocko."
01:07:05.271,01:07:06.564,Wow.
01:07:06.564,01:07:07.983,Thank you.
01:07:07.983,01:07:09.233,Nice to meet you.
01:07:09.233,01:07:11.152,"Oh, ho, ho."
01:07:11.152,01:07:12.570,He is so smart.
01:07:12.570,01:07:17.074,"Check this out. Jocko, what does the teapot do when the water's ready?"
01:07:20.119,01:07:21.371,"Oh, very good."
01:07:21.371,01:07:22.622,"Hey, can I ask him a question?"
01:07:22.622,01:07:24.123,Go ahead.
01:07:24.123,01:07:25.416,Jocko...
01:07:26.710,01:07:32.590,Do you think that Henry and I are ready to take our relationship to the next level?
01:07:33.758,01:07:35.426,Hmm. You sure about that?
01:07:35.426,01:07:41.516,And do you think that I should bring him into the other room and take advantage of him?
01:07:47.146,01:07:49.106,I saw that hand gesture...
01:07:49.106,01:07:50.316,and I'm glad you did it.
01:07:50.316,01:07:52.777,Really? Mm. Mm...
01:08:02.913,01:08:04.414,Use that.
01:08:04.414,01:08:05.957,"Oh, wow. Look."
01:08:05.957,01:08:07.709,"They're, uh..."
01:08:07.709,01:08:08.960,"They're nodding, in..."
01:08:08.960,01:08:10.086,"in approval, I hope."
01:08:10.086,01:08:11.379,"Oh, yeah, no, they like you."
01:08:11.379,01:08:12.839,Let me get them out of there.
01:08:12.839,01:08:14.799,"Mary Kate, Ashley, get a life. Thank you."
01:08:14.799,01:08:17.176,Sorry.
01:08:17.176,01:08:19.596,"Yeah, so are you."
01:08:19.596,01:08:21.180,Let me get you down slow.
01:08:21.180,01:08:22.599,Thank you.
01:08:22.599,01:08:24.517,My pleasure.
01:08:46.497,01:08:50.209,"HENRY: All right, I just wrote this, so go easy on me."
01:10:28.391,01:10:30.601,Can't fall asleep.
01:10:30.601,01:10:32.269,I'm not sleeping.
01:10:32.269,01:10:34.271,I'm just...
01:10:34.271,01:10:36.191,closing my eyes.
01:10:36.191,01:10:38.609,"Well, I'm gonna go downstairs then."
01:10:38.609,01:10:40.236,"No, no."
01:10:40.236,01:10:42.363,I'm just resting.
01:10:45.116,01:10:46.701,Lucy?
01:10:46.701,01:10:48.619,Yeah?
01:10:48.619,01:10:51.039,Will you marry me?
01:10:57.628,01:10:59.839,Of course.
01:10:59.839,01:11:01.758,Good.
01:11:01.758,01:11:04.385,Don't forget about me.
01:11:04.385,01:11:07.055,Never.
01:11:23.404,01:11:25.573,Good morning.
01:11:32.329,01:11:33.456,"Oh, shit!"
01:11:33.456,01:11:34.749,"HENRY: No, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
01:11:34.749,01:11:36.876,Help!
01:11:36.876,01:11:38.795,"Hey, hey, hey, hey!"
01:11:38.795,01:11:43.674,"Okay, I know this is hard for you to understand right now, but we are actually seeing each other."
01:11:43.674,01:11:45.718,We've been seeing each other for a while now.
01:11:45.718,01:11:47.011,Lucy! Lucy! Lucy!
01:11:47.011,01:11:49.722,"If I wasn't telling the truth, how would I know this?"
01:11:49.722,01:11:56.562,"That you're an art teacher and you go to the Hukilau Cafe every Sunday, and you make waffle houses, and-and-and you like Casablanca lilies."
01:11:56.562,01:11:57.814,Stalker!
01:11:57.814,01:12:00.608,Don't you remember me a little?
01:12:07.824,01:12:11.995,"Well, I may not be able to kick your ass, but my sister sure can."
01:12:11.995,01:12:14.664,"Well, little Sammy Sosa's a bit shook up, but she'll be okay."
01:12:14.664,01:12:16.791,She's watching the tape as we speak.
01:12:16.791,01:12:18.835,"How's my temporal lobe looking there, doc?"
01:12:18.835,01:12:20.461,"Mm, don't worry."
01:12:20.461,01:12:23.673,"You're not gonna suffer any short-term memory loss, but..."
01:12:23.673,01:12:26.050,was your head shaped like an egg before she hit you?
01:12:26.050,01:12:27.677,"Hey, don't make fun of Henry."
01:12:27.677,01:12:29.428,It's not his fault his head is shaped like that.
01:12:29.428,01:12:30.721,Note the intense overreaction.
01:12:30.721,01:12:32.473,That's the 'roids talking.
01:12:32.473,01:12:35.476,"Doug, once again, off the juice."
01:12:35.476,01:12:36.727,It's not juice.
01:12:36.727,01:12:38.479,It's a protein shake.
01:12:38.479,01:12:42.817,"DR. KEATS: So, Henry, the boys tell me you're setting sail for Alaska to study walruses."
01:12:42.817,01:12:44.319,When does that adventure begin?
01:12:44.319,01:12:46.821,"Oh, that adventure actually began, like, 10 years ago."
01:12:46.821,01:12:50.533,That's when I started planning and saving and building my boat.
01:12:50.533,01:12:54.453,All I know about walruses is that out of all mammals they have the second largest penis.
01:12:54.453,01:12:57.248,I have the first.
01:12:58.333,01:13:00.459,"Aw, that's my joke."
01:13:00.459,01:13:02.545,Did you tell Lucy about this trip yet?
01:13:02.545,01:13:04.672,Well...
01:13:04.672,01:13:08.676,"actually, there's nothing to tell, because I decided not to go."
01:13:08.676,01:13:11.304,"I mean, Lucy needs me here."
01:13:11.304,01:13:15.892,I'm just worried about going away for a year and ruining all the progress she's made.
01:13:15.892,01:13:22.606,"I mean, I know you think I'm crazy, but I think, deep down inside, she's starting to remember who I am."
01:13:22.606,01:13:23.900,"No, Henry."
01:13:23.900,01:13:25.318,That's what you want to believe.
01:13:25.318,01:13:29.655,"Hell, it's what we all want to believe, but it's never gonna happen."
01:13:33.910,01:13:36.204,Okay. I got to go to work.
01:13:36.204,01:13:39.290,"Uh, will you tell her I'll be back later to pick her up?"
01:13:39.290,01:13:40.708,See you guys.
01:13:40.708,01:13:42.752,Don't tell anyone your sister beat me up.
01:13:42.752,01:13:47.340,"I tell you, that kid could go to the moon and back and Lucy would never even know he left."
01:13:47.340,01:13:50.385,"Sometimes, I wish my wife had Goldfield's Syndrome."
01:13:50.385,01:13:59.435,"That way, she wouldn't remember last night, when I called her mother a loud, obnoxious drunk with a face like J. Edgar Hoover's ass."
01:13:59.435,01:14:03.981,"All right, there's your medicine, little fella."
01:14:03.981,01:14:05.358,Ula!
01:14:05.358,01:14:11.530,"Get back to cleaning the pool, and if that's one of your special brownies, don't let any of the dolphins eat that."
01:14:11.530,01:14:15.243,How do you think I get the dolphins to do double flip and play with the white kids?
01:14:19.289,01:14:20.748,"Okay, Willie, that's it."
01:14:20.748,01:14:23.000,"This time, try to stay clean for more than a day."
01:14:23.000,01:14:24.627,I made you a nice anchovy sundae.
01:14:24.627,01:14:27.422,"Okay, enjoy that."
01:14:27.422,01:14:29.340,Henry?
01:14:29.340,01:14:31.092,Hey!
01:14:31.092,01:14:33.928,How's your head?
01:14:33.928,01:14:35.512,Good.
01:14:35.512,01:14:37.848,What brings Your Royal Cuteness out here?
01:14:37.848,01:14:39.309,I needed to see you.
01:14:39.309,01:14:41.352,Okay. What you got there?
01:14:41.352,01:14:43.020,It's my journal.
01:14:43.020,01:14:44.521,I write in it every night.
01:14:44.521,01:14:45.898,"Oh, you don't like the video?"
01:14:45.898,01:14:47.566,No. I love it.
01:14:47.566,01:14:57.618,"It's just that, sometimes when I watch it, I feel like I'm being told about my life from someone else, and when I read this, it's like I'm telling myself."
01:14:57.618,01:14:59.287,When did you start this up?
01:14:59.287,01:15:01.789,Right after you gave me the video.
01:15:01.789,01:15:03.458,Really?
01:15:03.458,01:15:07.878,I was so nervous to come here and meet the guy that makes me fall in love with him every day.
01:15:07.878,01:15:11.048,"Well, you probably thought I couldn't live up to the hype."
01:15:11.048,01:15:12.258,No.
01:15:12.258,01:15:14.302,I was nervous because...
01:15:16.804,01:15:19.598,because I came here to break up with you.
01:15:21.267,01:15:24.770,You had plans and a life...
01:15:24.770,01:15:30.401,"before you met me, and now all you have time for is to make me fall in love with you every day."
01:15:30.401,01:15:31.819,That's not all I do.
01:15:31.819,01:15:33.529,I gave a penguin a bath today.
01:15:36.324,01:15:38.242,Which I'll have to do again tomorrow.
01:15:38.242,01:15:43.414,"Henry, I look at my dad and my brother's lives, and I won't do that to you."
01:15:43.414,01:15:44.748,What do you want me to do?
01:15:44.748,01:15:47.835,Be some stupid chapter in your scrapbook and then go on my way?
01:15:47.835,01:15:49.628,No.
01:15:49.628,01:15:57.094,"My plan is to erase you completely, so it's as if you never existed."
01:15:58.388,01:16:01.182,Why are you doing this?
01:16:01.182,01:16:06.437,Because you have to understand that there is no future with me.
01:16:06.437,01:16:08.147,Don't you want to have...
01:16:08.147,01:16:11.650,a career and marriage and children?
01:16:11.650,01:16:13.361,I asked you to marry me last night.
01:16:13.361,01:16:14.611,You said yes.
01:16:14.611,01:16:16.072,"Kids? Yeah, I'd love to do it."
01:16:16.072,01:16:18.366,But...
01:16:18.366,01:16:20.410,how is that going to work?
01:16:20.410,01:16:26.874,I'm gonna wake up every morning with an enormous pregnant belly and no memory of how it happened?
01:16:26.874,01:16:35.758,"I have to make a new journal that doesn't have you in it, but before I do, I really want you to read what I wrote about you."
01:16:35.758,01:16:41.055,"I will read about it tomorrow, when you forget about all this breaking up stuff, okay?"
01:16:41.055,01:16:42.681,I'm not going to forget about it.
01:16:42.681,01:16:44.267,I already wrote it down.
01:16:44.267,01:16:48.187,"I won't let myself, and I'm gonna do it whether you want me to or not."
01:16:48.187,01:16:50.398,I'll be at my house.
01:16:58.531,01:17:01.325,"Okay, type this one in there."
01:17:01.325,01:17:03.202,"LUCY: Saturday, November 25th."
01:17:03.202,01:17:08.165,I drove out to Callahan Institute today and had a talk with Dr. Keats.
01:17:08.165,01:17:11.085,"Uh, there's one about me."
01:17:11.085,01:17:13.588,Reminder.
01:17:13.588,01:17:16.173,He makes funny noises when I kiss his neck.
01:17:16.173,01:17:17.925,I'm gonna miss that.
01:17:17.925,01:17:20.428,You sure you don't want me to put that in there?
01:17:28.685,01:17:30.062,We can skip that one.
01:17:30.062,01:17:31.355,"No, no, no, let me read it."
01:17:31.355,01:17:32.773,We made love tonight.
01:17:32.773,01:17:35.526,"It didn't last long, but it was incredible."
01:17:35.526,01:17:37.445,Hmm.
01:17:37.445,01:17:39.363,It's not all about how long you go.
01:17:39.363,01:17:42.741,"It's... You know, there was a connection, I thought."
01:17:42.741,01:17:45.744,"Actually, let's just rip that out."
01:18:07.642,01:18:11.061,"Well, that's that."
01:18:18.528,01:18:20.279,"Henry, wait!"
01:18:26.410,01:18:29.830,Could I have one last first kiss?
01:19:42.278,01:19:43.820,"I ain't gonna do this, Marlin."
01:19:43.820,01:19:45.197,"You have to, Henry."
01:20:17.938,01:20:21.651,"I'm gonna miss you, buddy, but I got to get the hell off this island."
01:20:21.651,01:20:27.782,"I'm sorry I can't take you with me, but you've lived here so long, you're too big of a pansy to defend yourself in the wild."
01:20:29.116,01:20:30.367,I don't feel bad for you.
01:20:30.367,01:20:32.995,I know you got a little romantic thing going on with Candace.
01:20:36.415,01:20:38.459,Candace and Bernice?
01:20:40.961,01:20:42.505,"Candace, Bernice, and Rose?"
01:20:43.839,01:20:45.758,Yeah.
01:20:45.758,01:20:47.551,I fell for one chick and I'm losing my mind.
01:20:47.551,01:20:48.803,Good luck with that.
01:20:48.803,01:20:50.053,"Okay, baby."
01:20:50.053,01:20:51.054,I love you.
01:20:52.264,01:20:53.599,"Thanks, buddy."
01:20:53.599,01:20:57.144,"Remember to use a condom, or in your case, a Hefty bag."
01:21:07.404,01:21:08.823,Well...
01:21:08.823,01:21:10.700,"okay, you guys."
01:21:10.700,01:21:12.618,Thanks for coming to say goodbye.
01:21:12.618,01:21:14.036,Be careful.
01:21:14.036,01:21:17.832,"Well, you guys just make sure your father doesn't get eaten by a shark."
01:21:19.208,01:21:20.459,Honah Lee...
01:21:24.046,01:21:25.506,"Thank you, buddy."
01:21:25.506,01:21:27.508,What does that mean again?
01:21:27.508,01:21:29.510,Bring me back a t-shirt.
01:21:29.510,01:21:31.178,Oh. Okay.
01:21:31.178,01:21:32.346,You got it.
01:21:32.346,01:21:33.681,Come here.
01:21:33.681,01:21:35.015,Love you guys.
01:21:36.266,01:21:39.520,My shirt size is medium husky.
01:21:39.520,01:21:41.188,Hey!
01:21:41.188,01:21:43.148,Kikikuloa!
01:21:43.148,01:21:44.483,No flippies off the dock!
01:21:44.483,01:21:46.193,You could get hurt!
01:21:48.654,01:21:51.114,No! All right.
01:21:51.114,01:21:53.659,Let the master show you how to get it done.
01:21:53.659,01:21:55.035,Oy.
01:21:58.622,01:21:59.998,Ooh!
01:21:59.998,01:22:01.500,Oh.
01:22:01.500,01:22:04.253,"Now, you kids go down there and find my nuts."
01:22:04.253,01:22:05.713,Oh...
01:22:05.713,01:22:08.799,Sure you don't want to take Doug with you?
01:22:08.799,01:22:11.594,Hey! What the heck are you guys doing here?
01:22:11.594,01:22:18.726,"Well, I spoke to the harbormaster and he said you were setting sail today, so we thought we'd drop by and wish you bon voyage."
01:22:18.726,01:22:20.143,This is from Nick and Sue.
01:22:20.143,01:22:22.563,They send their best wishes for a safe trip.
01:22:22.563,01:22:24.523,That's very nice.
01:22:24.523,01:22:26.024,All right.
01:22:26.024,01:22:28.026,I love Spam and Reese's.
01:22:28.026,01:22:29.862,Um... I guess.
01:22:29.862,01:22:32.114,Doug!
01:22:32.114,01:22:35.200,That's all right.
01:22:35.200,01:22:37.536,So...
01:22:37.536,01:22:38.829,how's Lucy?
01:22:38.829,01:22:40.623,"Actually, she's..."
01:22:40.623,01:22:42.124,living at the Institute.
01:22:42.124,01:22:44.501,When did that happen?
01:22:44.501,01:22:46.796,Three weeks ago.
01:22:46.796,01:22:49.339,Said she didn't want to be a burden to me and Doug anymore.
01:22:49.339,01:22:50.591,I don't know.
01:22:50.591,01:22:52.259,I couldn't talk her out of it.
01:22:52.259,01:22:54.511,You know what? She's doing really great up there.
01:22:54.511,01:22:59.015,She's teaching an art class for the others and she gets to paint every day.
01:22:59.015,01:23:01.184,"Actually, she's even singing again."
01:23:01.184,01:23:02.352,"Hey, look, Henry, I, uh..."
01:23:02.352,01:23:03.854,I got a little gift for you too.
01:23:03.854,01:23:07.524,It's just a little something from one sailor to another one.
01:23:07.524,01:23:09.318,Mahalo.
01:23:09.318,01:23:10.611,Yeah.
01:23:10.611,01:23:11.946,"Take care of yourself out there, okay?"
01:23:11.946,01:23:14.281,I will.
01:23:23.165,01:23:24.875,ALEXA: Henry did not tell me about you.
01:23:24.875,01:23:27.252,Your fisherman muscles.
01:23:27.252,01:23:29.505,Can I touch?
01:23:29.505,01:23:31.465,Sure.
01:23:37.012,01:23:38.764,Yes.
01:23:45.228,01:23:48.315,The Beach Boys?
01:23:48.315,01:23:54.780,How nice of that man to give me a CD that will remind me of all the wonderful times I shared with his daughter.
01:23:54.780,01:23:57.616,What an asshole!
01:24:18.929,01:24:21.515,Why would you do this to me?
01:24:21.515,01:24:24.142,You sick bastard!
01:24:28.981,01:24:30.816,"Oh, my God."
01:24:30.816,01:24:32.902,Is he trying to tell me something?
01:24:37.447,01:24:40.200,She only sings on days she meets you.
01:24:42.244,01:24:44.287,She remembers me?
01:24:44.287,01:24:45.622,Holy shit.
01:24:47.123,01:24:50.126,She remembers me!
01:24:55.298,01:24:57.133,"Julia, that looks great."
01:24:57.133,01:24:58.385,Excuse me.
01:24:58.385,01:24:59.595,What am I doing?
01:24:59.595,01:25:03.139,"You're painting a picture, and you're doing an excellent job."
01:25:03.139,01:25:04.474,Oh.
01:25:06.268,01:25:07.811,Holy crap!
01:25:07.811,01:25:09.563,I suck.
01:25:18.280,01:25:19.823,"Hey, hey, hey!"
01:25:19.823,01:25:21.116,"Can we help you, sir?"
01:25:21.116,01:25:22.785,Yes. I have an appointment.
01:25:22.785,01:25:25.203,What's your name?
01:25:25.203,01:25:26.413,Um...
01:25:26.413,01:25:27.873,Um...
01:25:27.873,01:25:29.625,"Dude, he forgot his name."
01:25:29.625,01:25:31.209,I feel bad for him.
01:25:31.209,01:25:34.463,"Just go on up, sir, and good luck with that memory problem."
01:25:34.463,01:25:36.757,Yeah. Thank you.
01:25:38.425,01:25:39.760,What?
01:25:39.760,01:25:42.638,HENRY: Lucy!
01:25:42.638,01:25:44.807,Lucy!
01:25:44.807,01:25:45.975,"Hi, I'm Tom."
01:25:45.975,01:25:48.143,I met you before.
01:25:48.143,01:25:50.520,Maybe you can help me out.
01:25:50.520,01:25:52.272,Do you have any idea where I can find her?
01:25:52.272,01:25:53.607,"Hi, I'm Tom."
01:25:53.607,01:25:54.900,Oh...
01:25:54.900,01:25:57.193,"Thanks, anyway."
01:25:57.193,01:25:59.989,Lucy!
01:25:59.989,01:26:01.698,Lucy!
01:26:05.535,01:26:07.454,Lucy Whitmore?
01:26:07.454,01:26:10.624,Can I ask you a question?
01:26:13.251,01:26:15.921,Do you have any idea who I am?
01:26:21.718,01:26:22.970,No.
01:26:22.970,01:26:24.805,No?
01:26:26.515,01:26:28.725,That sucks.
01:26:30.310,01:26:31.561,What's your name?
01:26:31.561,01:26:33.229,I'm Henry.
01:26:33.229,01:26:35.273,Henry.
01:26:35.273,01:26:38.152,I want to show you something.
01:26:38.152,01:26:39.736,Will you come with me?
01:26:39.736,01:26:41.488,"Well, yeah."
01:26:42.656,01:26:45.075,Hey.
01:26:45.075,01:26:47.536,"Dude, I don't even know who I am."
01:26:47.536,01:26:49.913,"Oh, well, you're Pablo Picasso."
01:26:49.913,01:26:52.666,Really?
01:26:52.666,01:26:54.001,Not really.
01:26:57.504,01:26:59.339,This is my studio.
01:27:01.216,01:27:03.635,Wow.
01:27:18.316,01:27:22.071,"I don't know who you are, Henry..."
01:27:22.071,01:27:26.449,but I dream about you almost every night.
01:27:29.661,01:27:31.997,Why?
01:27:31.997,01:27:39.713,What would you say if I told you that notebook you read every day used to have a lot of stuff about me in it?
01:27:39.713,01:27:43.550,I would say that that makes a lot of sense.
01:27:43.550,01:27:54.310,"You erased me from your memories because you thought you were holding me back from having a full and happy life, but you made a mistake."
01:27:54.310,01:27:58.023,Being with you is the only way I could have a full and happy life.
01:27:58.023,01:28:02.778,"You're the girl of my dreams, and..."
01:28:02.778,01:28:05.530,"apparently, I'm the man of yours."
01:28:10.160,01:28:11.703,Henry.
01:28:11.703,01:28:13.622,It's nice to meet you.
01:28:13.622,01:28:17.500,"Lucy, it's nice to meet you too."
01:28:22.589,01:28:23.840,"Hi, I'm Tom."
01:28:23.840,01:28:26.051,"Henry, Lucy."
01:28:26.051,01:28:29.138,"Now, why don't you come back in 10 seconds, so we can meet again?"
01:29:14.808,01:29:23.775,"ULA: Do you, Honah Lee, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold, from this day forth, as long as you both shall live?"
01:29:23.775,01:29:26.069,I do.
01:29:26.069,01:29:33.743,"Even though in, like, 10, 15 years, she could possibly let herself go, and then, like, sex could be, like, nauseating for you?"
01:29:33.743,01:29:36.663,"HENRY: What are you, nuts?"
01:29:38.581,01:29:40.458,"I'm just kidding, Muumuu."
01:29:40.458,01:29:43.753,I now pronounce you man and wife.
01:29:48.717,01:29:50.093,GUESTS: Mazel tov!
01:29:51.511,01:29:57.184,"HENRY: It's very cold outside, so when you're ready, put on a jacket and come have breakfast with me."
01:29:57.184,01:29:58.310,Love you.
01:30:28.965,01:30:31.634,"Hey, hey!"
01:30:31.634,01:30:33.636,"Good morning, Mrs. Roth."
01:30:33.636,01:30:35.597,Would you like to meet your daughter?
01:30:35.597,01:30:37.057,Go say hello to Mommy.
01:30:39.017,01:30:40.269,"Hi, Mommy."
01:30:42.478,01:30:44.356,That's right.
01:30:46.066,01:30:48.151,Good morning.
01:30:48.151,01:30:49.485,Mwah.
01:30:49.485,01:30:51.196,"Oh, my goodness."
01:30:51.196,01:30:52.446,Mm-hmm.
01:30:52.446,01:30:54.824,Grandpa's here.
