00:11:37.447,00:11:39.616,Why are you pretending to be a cop?

00:13:38.817,00:13:42.322,"And I think if I was Sigmund fucking Freud, I wouldn't get an answer."
00:13:42.322,00:13:46.825,"So tell me, what's a lace-curtain motherfucker like you doing in the staties?"
00:13:48.620,00:13:52.457,"Families are always rising and falling in America, am I right?"
00:13:52.457,00:13:53.541,Who said that?
00:13:53.541,00:13:55.168,Hawthorne.
00:13:55.168,00:13:58.546,Pfft! What's the matter?
00:14:02.634,00:14:04.678,We have a question.
00:14:05.679,00:14:10.849,"Do you wanna be a cop, or do you wanna appear to be a cop?"
00:14:10.849,00:14:12.268,It's an honest question.
00:14:12.268,00:14:16.022,"A lot of guys wanna appear to be cops: gun, badge, pretend they're on TV."
00:14:16.022,00:14:18.983,A lot of 'em wanna slam a nigger's head through a window.
00:14:18.983,00:14:21.152,I'm all set without your personal job application.
00:14:21.152,00:14:22.903,The fuck did you say?
00:14:21.152,00:14:25.323,"All due respect, what do you want from me?"
00:14:25.323,00:14:26.783,"I know what you are, okay?"
00:14:26.783,00:14:28.827,"I know what you are, and I know what you're not."
00:14:28.827,00:14:30.745,I'm the best friend you have on this earth.
00:14:30.745,00:14:32.831,"I'm gonna help you understand something, punk."
00:14:32.831,00:14:35.166,You're no fucking cop!
00:14:36.376,00:14:37.669,QUEENAN: He's right.
00:14:37.669,00:14:39.671,We deal in deception here.
00:14:39.671,00:14:42.632,What we do not deal with is self-deception.
00:14:42.632,00:14:45.635,"Five years from now, you could be anything else in the world."
00:14:45.635,00:14:49.013,But you will be not be a Massachusetts state trooper.
00:14:49.972,00:14:51.265,You sure of that?
00:14:51.265,00:14:52.392,I'm sure of that.
00:14:52.392,00:14:53.518,Guaran-fucking-teed.
00:14:55.645,00:14:57.772,"DIGNAM: You got 1400 on your SATs, kid."
00:14:57.772,00:15:00.107,"You're an astronaut, not a statie."
00:15:02.318,00:15:03.737,You don't have much family.
00:15:04.904,00:15:06.906,I don't have any family.
00:15:11.536,00:15:16.332,MAN: What's this I hear from Stephanie about you becoming a policeman?
00:15:16.332,00:15:19.460,You mean Stephanie who was the only one who came to my father's funeral?
00:15:19.460,00:15:20.670,That-- That Stephanie?
00:15:20.670,00:15:23.005,"Yeah, that Stephanie."
00:15:23.005,00:15:24.549,"Nothing much to it, Uncle Edward."
00:15:24.549,00:15:27.051,"Well, you trying to prove something to the family?"
00:15:27.051,00:15:32.265,"When you say the family, who do you mean exactly? You?"
00:15:32.265,00:15:35.476,"UNCLE EDWARD: You always have to question everything, don't you?"
00:15:35.476,00:15:39.856,Maybe it would have done you some good to have some questions from time to time.
00:15:39.856,00:15:41.148,Am I an asshole?
00:15:41.148,00:15:42.650,Are my kids a mess?
00:15:42.650,00:15:45.111,Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?
00:15:45.111,00:15:47.572,"Heh. I mean, those are questions, right?"
00:15:47.572,00:15:52.577,"Have I ever been good to my dying sister, or am I just now pretending to be?"
00:15:56.539,00:15:58.750,Do you need some money for the funeral?
00:16:01.961,00:16:04.964,"When my mother dies, we don't have any more connection."
00:16:04.964,00:16:06.716,MAN: It's very lovely.
00:16:06.716,00:16:09.594,You get the high ceilings.
00:16:09.594,00:16:11.178,The bathroom is massive.
00:16:11.178,00:16:14.849,"The, uh, fridge, it's got an alarm in it, in case you have, you know, eating issues..."
00:16:14.849,00:16:17.435,"which is a joke, not a very funny one."
00:16:17.435,00:16:19.145,There's a great view of the statehouse.
00:16:19.145,00:16:22.022,"Beacon Hill, if you can see it."
00:16:22.022,00:16:24.275,"You move in, you're upper class by about Tuesday."
00:16:25.944,00:16:27.904,So you're a cop?
00:16:27.904,00:16:29.989,"Yeah, a state-police detective."
00:16:29.989,00:16:32.241,State-police detective.
00:16:32.241,00:16:35.369,"And are you a married state-police detective, or....?"
00:16:35.369,00:16:37.246,No.
00:16:37.246,00:16:42.919,"'Cause it's kind of a-- Sort of a big place, and-- I have a cosigner."
00:16:42.919,00:16:44.337,"Oh, cool."
00:16:44.337,00:16:46.756,"Yeah, you intend to have a houseguest, that's cool."
00:16:46.756,00:16:47.966,Good.
00:16:47.966,00:16:50.259,"Yeah, it's got-- Just give me the papers."
00:16:50.259,00:16:51.761,Sure.
00:16:53.721,00:16:55.765,"PRIEST: Eternal rest grant unto her, O, Lord."
00:16:55.765,00:16:58.142,And let perpetual light shine upon her.
00:16:58.142,00:17:00.311,ALL: Amen.
00:17:00.311,00:17:07.735,"Amen. May her soul and the souls of all the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace."
00:17:08.528,00:17:10.029,Amen.
00:17:32.468,00:17:33.928,So what do I do?
00:17:33.928,00:17:36.430,There's money behind this operation.
00:17:36.430,00:17:39.517,"You won't be paid as a regular cop, but there's a bonus involved."
00:17:40.768,00:17:42.102,Tax free.
00:17:43.646,00:17:46.649,We can't conceal that you were a trainee.
00:17:46.649,00:17:48.693,You'll be convicted of a crime.
00:17:48.693,00:17:52.780,We're thinking a guilty plea to assault and battery would make sense.
00:17:52.780,00:17:53.990,Given your nature.
00:17:53.990,00:17:57.076,You do enough jail time to convince anyone this is no setup.
00:17:57.076,00:18:01.706,"You'd be on probation, see a court-ordered shrink, the whole nine yards."
00:18:01.706,00:18:06.252,"You wanna serve the Commonwealth, this is your chance."
00:18:06.252,00:18:08.588,"We need you, pal."
00:18:08.588,00:18:11.758,You've already pretended to be a Costigan from South Boston.
00:18:11.758,00:18:13.718,"Every weekend, sergeant."
00:18:13.718,00:18:14.928,Perfect.
00:18:17.471,00:18:19.015,Do it again.
00:18:20.266,00:18:21.308,For me.
00:18:55.843,00:18:58.054,"Hey, you Billy Costigan?"
00:18:58.054,00:18:59.513,"Yeah, who wants to know?"
00:18:59.513,00:19:00.723,"Oh, nothing."
00:19:00.723,00:19:02.558,I know a Sean Costigan down on L Street.
00:19:02.558,00:19:04.226,That's my cousin.
00:19:04.226,00:19:06.062,"Connected, not too bright."
00:19:06.062,00:19:07.939,"Yeah, I know."
00:19:25.539,00:19:27.667,Billy?
00:19:27.667,00:19:29.002,"Oh, my God."
00:19:29.002,00:19:30.920,"Aunt Kathy, how are you?"
00:19:30.920,00:19:32.713,"Oh, good to see you."
00:19:32.713,00:19:34.048,Come on in.
00:19:34.924,00:19:36.968,They said you was in the staties.
00:19:36.968,00:19:38.260,I couldn't believe it.
00:19:38.260,00:19:40.387,"I got kicked out, like, four months ago."
00:19:40.387,00:19:42.932,"Yeah, it was in the papers."
00:19:44.934,00:19:46.352,So you know.
00:19:46.352,00:19:49.689,"And, uh...why are we graced with your presence?"
00:19:49.689,00:19:52.108,I brought your mother some pictures of my father.
00:19:52.108,00:19:54.152,"AUNT KATHY: Oh, look at the smile."
00:19:54.152,00:19:56.154,BILLY: My mother had them.
00:19:57.488,00:19:58.823,My mother's dead.
00:19:58.823,00:20:02.493,"Oh, God. I'm sorry."
00:20:03.327,00:20:06.080,"I was at a funeral myself, uh..."
00:20:06.539,00:20:08.374,Myles Kennefick.
00:20:08.374,00:20:10.376,Knew him in school.
00:20:10.376,00:20:11.752,"He was a young guy, you know?"
00:20:11.752,00:20:13.671,"It's terrible, it's a shame."
00:20:13.671,00:20:16.174,You remember that. What a night.
00:20:17.884,00:20:19.468,I got like...
00:20:19.468,00:20:21.428,"Like 30,000 bucks, right?"
00:20:21.428,00:20:23.222,Insurance money.
00:20:23.222,00:20:24.974,"You know, after my mother passed."
00:20:24.974,00:20:26.184,Yeah. Yeah.
00:20:26.184,00:20:31.605,"In your line of work, if I gave you like, what, say 10,000..."
00:20:31.605,00:20:33.024,what could I get back?
00:20:34.441,00:20:36.443,You know what you...
00:20:36.443,00:20:38.779,You know what you usually say at these moments.
00:20:38.779,00:20:39.989,What?
00:20:40.948,00:20:41.991,What?
00:20:41.991,00:20:43.117,"Come on, man."
00:20:43.117,00:20:45.244,"Ah, come on, you fucking moron."
00:20:45.244,00:20:46.370,Come on.
00:20:47.163,00:20:49.040,"What, you want me to say it?"
00:20:49.040,00:20:50.332,Huh?
00:20:52.585,00:20:55.295,"I'm not a cop, all right?"
00:20:56.214,00:20:58.091,I'm your fucking cousin.
00:20:58.091,00:20:59.800,"Yeah, you're bad."
00:21:00.843,00:21:02.136,"You corrupt fuck, man."
00:21:02.136,00:21:03.930,You must be my cousin.
00:21:06.682,00:21:09.435,SEAN: Fucking Ricans think they know everything.
00:21:09.435,00:21:12.563,"If they knew shit, they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans."
00:21:12.563,00:21:14.607,R is for Ricans.
00:21:14.607,00:21:16.067,P is for pigs.
00:21:16.067,00:21:19.862,"BILLY: Would you shut the fuck up for five seconds, huh?"
00:21:19.862,00:21:21.321,That's right.
00:21:21.321,00:21:22.531,You used to be a cop.
00:21:22.531,00:21:26.119,"When we're working together, limit it to two eight-balls an hour, all right?"
00:21:26.119,00:21:29.872,We're not supposed to be doing this this close to Worcester.
00:21:29.872,00:21:31.415,This side of Worcester.
00:21:31.415,00:21:32.959,Says who?
00:21:32.959,00:21:35.128,Says him.
00:21:35.128,00:21:37.797,"God says, as far as you're..."
00:21:37.797,00:21:39.298,concerned.
00:21:42.426,00:21:43.677,"SEAN: No, no, no, he's no cop."
00:21:43.677,00:21:45.972,He got out of the joint three weeks ago.
00:21:45.972,00:21:48.015,MAN: Cunt cop.
00:21:48.015,00:21:51.102,"He's-- He talks like his shit don't stink, but he's good people."
00:21:51.102,00:21:52.895,"Well, I knew his father."
00:21:53.813,00:21:55.397,I liked his Uncle Jackie better.
00:21:55.397,00:21:56.482,Jackie was all right.
00:21:56.482,00:21:59.068,Uncle Jackie was excellent.
00:21:59.068,00:22:00.861,Fucking guineas.
00:22:00.861,00:22:02.113,To Jackie.
00:22:02.113,00:22:04.073,SEAN: Uncle Jackie.
00:22:04.991,00:22:06.700,Cranberry juice.
00:22:08.702,00:22:10.537,It's a natural diuretic.
00:22:10.537,00:22:12.957,My girlfriend drinks it when she's got her period.
00:22:14.416,00:22:17.128,"What, do you got your period?"
00:22:20.089,00:22:23.217,"Now who's got their fucking period, huh?!"
00:22:26.095,00:22:28.388,"Hey, get your fucking hands off me!"
00:22:28.388,00:22:30.057,Hey. Hey.
00:22:31.767,00:22:33.019,Do you know me?
00:22:33.727,00:22:35.604,No. No.
00:22:36.897,00:22:42.153,"Well, I'm the guy that tells you there are guys you can hit and there's guys you can't."
00:22:42.153,00:22:46.740,"Now that's not quite a guy you can't hit, but it's almost a guy you can't hit."
00:22:46.740,00:22:49.535,So I'm gonna make a fucking ruling on this right now.
00:22:49.535,00:22:51.287,You don't fucking hit him.
00:22:51.287,00:22:52.788,You understand?
00:22:55.208,00:22:57.043,"Yeah, excellent. Fine."
00:22:57.043,00:22:58.294,"Fine, fine."
00:22:59.545,00:23:01.964,I fucking know you.
00:23:01.964,00:23:03.757,I know your family.
00:23:03.757,00:23:11.932,"You make one more drug deal with that idiot fucking cop-magnet of a cousin of yours, and I'll forget your grandmother was so nice to me."
00:23:11.932,00:23:13.726,I'll cut your fucking nuts off.
00:23:13.726,00:23:15.019,You understand that?
00:23:16.729,00:23:18.147,Yeah.
00:23:18.147,00:23:20.149,"Yeah, I do."
00:23:21.775,00:23:23.277,What are you drinking?
00:23:30.201,00:23:32.578,A cranberry juice.
00:23:33.704,00:23:35.664,"What is it, your period?"
00:23:38.918,00:23:41.545,Get him a cranberry juice.
00:23:48.010,00:23:50.763,"Hey, fuckhead, that's Jackie's nephew."
00:23:50.763,00:23:52.306,Oh...
00:23:52.306,00:23:53.349,What?
00:23:53.349,00:23:54.725,"Oh, fucking what?"
00:23:57.937,00:23:59.855,Get the fuck outta here.
00:23:59.855,00:24:01.690,Sorry I'm late.
00:24:01.690,00:24:04.818,Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison to the undercover section.
00:24:04.818,00:24:06.362,His undercover work is extensive.
00:24:06.362,00:24:07.863,He's here to give us his report.
00:24:07.863,00:24:08.822,Sergeant Dignam.
00:24:08.822,00:24:10.448,Okay.
00:24:10.448,00:24:12.534,My people are out there.
00:24:12.534,00:24:16.414,"You're not gonna see 'em, you're not gonna hear about 'em, except through me or Captain Queenan."
00:24:16.414,00:24:19.625,You will not ever know the identity of undercover people.
00:24:19.625,00:24:22.628,"Unfortunately, this shithole has more leaks than the Iraqi navy."
00:24:22.628,00:24:23.796,Fuck yourself.
00:24:23.796,00:24:25.298,I'm tired from fucking your wife.
00:24:25.298,00:24:27.591,How's your mother?
00:24:27.591,00:24:31.637,"DIGNAM: Good. Today, girls, what I have for you is microprocessors."
00:24:31.762,00:24:38.894,"Somebody, as you may already know, stole 20 microprocessors from the Mass Processor company out on Route 128."
00:24:38.894,00:24:46.277,These are the kind of processors they put into computers that can put a cruise missile up the ass of a camel from a couple hundred miles away.
00:24:46.277,00:24:48.988,These pieces of plastic are worth about a hundred grand apiece.
00:24:48.988,00:24:50.530,Now get this.
00:24:50.530,00:24:59.873,"A guy working there two months walks out the front door with a box of processors on Tuesday, has a ticket booked for Florida on Wednesday, but on Thursday, he gets found in a Dumpster."
00:24:59.873,00:25:02.293,You know where that dirt ball started his life?
00:25:02.293,00:25:03.919,Southie projects.
00:25:03.919,00:25:05.379,What was his name?
00:25:05.379,00:25:06.964,Myles Kennefick.
00:25:06.964,00:25:08.966,Got the job with a forged UMass transcript.
00:25:08.966,00:25:11.844,"UMass, Boston, which happens to be in-- South Boston?"
00:25:11.844,00:25:13.220,"Oh, you're a fucking genius, huh?"
00:25:13.220,00:25:15.139,"Who forged your transcript, dickhead?"
00:25:15.139,00:25:18.684,"Hey, this guy-- His old man runs the Hibernian Liquor Mart."
00:25:20.936,00:25:23.397,We're not here to solve the case of the missing scumbag.
00:25:23.397,00:25:24.564,We're here to nail Costello.
00:25:24.564,00:25:25.607,"All right, look."
00:25:25.607,00:25:29.445,"We got a guy, says he hears Costello's moving the processors to China."
00:25:29.445,00:25:31.989,He set up the whole fucking job and popped Kennefick.
00:25:31.989,00:25:34.532,You do not want to miss it if Costello takes a dump.
00:25:34.532,00:25:38.120,We'd miss a lot less if you made your informants available to us and the Bureau.
00:25:38.120,00:25:42.124,"Without asking for too many details, do you have anyone in with Costello presently?"
00:25:42.124,00:25:44.918,Maybe. Maybe not.
00:25:44.918,00:25:46.670,Maybe fuck yourself.
00:25:46.670,00:25:49.006,My theory on Feds is they're like mushrooms.
00:25:49.006,00:25:51.008,Feed 'em shit and keep them in the dark.
00:25:51.008,00:25:52.134,You girls have a good day.
00:25:53.677,00:25:56.305,"Normally he's a very, uh, nice guy."
00:25:57.764,00:25:59.808,Don't judge him from this meeting alone.
00:26:02.560,00:26:05.939,"Now, Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son."
00:26:05.939,00:26:07.858,I knew Myles.
00:26:07.858,00:26:10.819,"Now, he was younger than me, but he was behind me in school."
00:26:10.819,00:26:13.197,I wanna get these people who did this to him.
00:26:13.197,00:26:14.572,Would you like to help us?
00:26:14.572,00:26:19.370,You wanna help us catch the people who forced your son to do a robbery and then killed him?
00:26:19.370,00:26:21.330,Allegedly.
00:26:21.330,00:26:23.374,Allegedly.
00:26:23.374,00:26:26.126,"If he was killed, he probably did something wrong."
00:26:26.126,00:26:27.920,But not the robbery.
00:26:27.920,00:26:29.380,He did something else wrong?
00:26:32.550,00:26:34.927,"Wave to your girlfriend, honey."
00:26:37.346,00:26:39.390,"I mean, fuck yourself."
00:26:40.807,00:26:42.017,Did you get that?
00:26:42.017,00:26:43.643,Allegedly or fuck yourself?
00:26:43.643,00:26:45.104,Welcome to the neighborhood.
00:26:45.104,00:26:47.689,"Different breed down here, sarge."
00:26:48.899,00:26:50.067,I need a cup of coffee.
00:27:04.164,00:27:05.749,You making a house call?
00:27:07.042,00:27:09.128,Have I seen you professionally?
00:27:09.128,00:27:12.714,"No, no. No, I know-- I know who you are, though. I know."
00:27:12.714,00:27:20.389,"Guys gotta use their service revolver in the course of duty, and then they get to come to talk to you about their feelings and whatnot."
00:27:20.389,00:27:22.224,"No, no, I know how it goes."
00:27:22.224,00:27:24.059,You're a mental health professional.
00:27:24.059,00:27:25.894,"Yeah, I have an appointment on this floor."
00:27:25.894,00:27:27.438,"Oh, well, you'll have fun."
00:27:27.438,00:27:30.023,They're all freaking crazy on that floor.
00:27:30.023,00:27:31.317,I'm one more up.
00:27:31.317,00:27:32.485,"Oh, fancy policeman."
00:27:32.485,00:27:33.735,"Yeah, that's right."
00:27:33.735,00:27:35.362,Are you a statie?
00:27:35.362,00:27:37.823,"I'm-- I'm actually going to law school also, though."
00:27:37.823,00:27:39.241,"Oh, Suffolk, nights?"
00:27:39.241,00:27:42.328,"Well, yeah, they don't run Harvard at night, last time I checked."
00:27:42.328,00:27:43.703,When's the last time you checked?
00:27:43.703,00:27:45.914,Before I went to fucking Suffolk.
00:27:45.914,00:27:48.875,"Okay, listen, I went to UMass."
00:27:48.875,00:27:51.711,"Well, I thought you were."
00:27:51.711,00:27:55.007,Maybe you can shoot someone and then you'd have to see me professionally.
00:27:55.007,00:27:59.970,I'll stab someone in the heart with a fucking ice pick if it gets me dinner with you.
00:27:59.970,00:28:02.598,"No, no. That's all right."
00:28:02.598,00:28:05.601,"No, sorry. I'm just joking."
00:28:05.601,00:28:07.353,Nice to meet you...Madolyn.
00:28:16.903,00:28:20.658,"Hi, Dad. I had no idea about the tail until I saw it."
00:28:20.658,00:28:21.950,"No, I couldn't."
00:28:21.950,00:28:26.746,"I had the other guy with me, I couldn't-- All right, it's a blue sedan and then a white van."
00:28:26.746,00:28:28.499,It's fucked up with graffiti on the side.
00:28:28.499,00:28:30.459,And the van is the audio surveillance.
00:28:30.459,00:28:32.044,"All right, have a nice day."
00:28:32.961,00:28:34.129,Cut him here.
00:28:35.548,00:28:36.756,Bye-bye.
00:28:41.094,00:28:42.346,MAN: Jerk-ass!
00:28:42.346,00:28:43.722,"MAN 1: Come on, Babu."
00:28:43.722,00:28:45.182,I can't do anymore.
00:28:45.182,00:28:46.933,Please don't let me go back empty-handed.
00:28:46.933,00:28:48.810,Don't do this.
00:28:48.810,00:28:51.689,MAN 2: Come to my store next Friday.
00:28:51.689,00:28:54.358,"MAN 1: This is Friday, Babu."
00:28:54.358,00:28:57.361,You keep on calling me Babu.
00:28:57.361,00:28:58.820,I-I'm trying to help you.
00:28:58.820,00:29:01.323,You keep on telling me I'm your friend.
00:29:01.323,00:29:02.824,You don't even know my fucking name.
00:29:02.824,00:29:04.493,MAN 1: You want me to catch a beatin'?
00:29:04.493,00:29:06.537,I'm gonna if I go back again like last week.

00:29:07.996,00:29:09.748,This guy don't want you to have the money.
00:29:09.748,00:29:11.667,He wants to come back there and squash your head.
00:29:11.667,00:29:13.210,And I don't wanna see that.
00:29:13.210,00:29:15.837,I have one customer sitting here. What I'm gonna do?
00:29:15.837,00:29:17.297,MAN 1: Business is bad?
00:29:17.297,00:29:18.965,You opened a store in an Irish neighborhood.
00:29:18.965,00:29:21.260,"These are dirty, dirty people."
00:29:21.260,00:29:23.387,"Sell potatoes, I don't know what you're gonna do."
00:29:23.387,00:29:25.431,"Excuse me, gentlemen."
00:29:25.431,00:29:26.890,Excuse me. Sorry.
00:29:26.890,00:29:28.642,"Hey, you fellas come from Providence?"
00:29:28.642,00:29:30.977,"It isn't any of your business where we come from, is it now?"
00:29:30.977,00:29:33.522,"What, are you fucking delivering cannolis or something?"
00:29:43.240,00:29:46.452,"Hey! You are killing my business, man!"
00:29:46.452,00:29:48.454,Ow! Fuck!
00:29:48.454,00:29:50.581,SINGH: What's wrong with this fucking country?
00:29:50.581,00:29:52.832,Everybody hates everybody!
00:29:57.087,00:29:59.298,Get out of here.
00:30:04.428,00:30:07.556,"COLIN: Now, you also do probation work, right?"
00:30:07.556,00:30:09.516,"That's right, I see violent offenders."
00:30:09.516,00:30:10.850,"Oh, bad guys."
00:30:10.850,00:30:13.812,Not necessarily. Heh.
00:30:13.812,00:30:15.147,Oh.
00:30:19.192,00:30:22.404,"Yeah, they got this, but they don't got duck l'orange."
00:30:22.404,00:30:24.030,Was your meal okay?
00:30:24.030,00:30:25.824,"Yeah, no, no, no, the lobster was good."
00:30:25.824,00:30:29.578,"I just, you know, 'cause it was a French restaurant I was surprised."
00:30:34.708,00:30:36.918,I'm waitin' for you to make your move.
00:30:36.918,00:30:39.921,"Look, I don't know, if that thing moves, I'm gonna shoot it."
00:30:39.921,00:30:41.465,I don't even know what it is.
00:30:41.465,00:30:44.677,...you have a call on 3015.
00:30:44.677,00:30:46.595,"Repeat, 3015."
00:30:48.388,00:30:53.935,COLIN: So what's it like having people find themselves in your office all day long?
00:30:53.935,00:30:56.563,Does it get messy with all those feelings flying around?
00:30:57.606,00:30:59.941,W-why? Does that make you uncomfortable?
00:30:59.941,00:31:01.318,"No, no, no, no."
00:31:01.318,00:31:04.321,"No, no, no."
00:31:05.698,00:31:07.366,You know what Freud said about the Irish?
00:31:07.366,00:31:09.451,"Yeah, I do."
00:31:09.451,00:31:12.788,"Yeah, if you actually do, I'll see you again."
00:31:13.580,00:31:16.709,Who says I wanna see you again?
00:31:20.295,00:31:21.588,Don't you?
00:31:23.131,00:31:24.842,You should see your face.
00:31:24.842,00:31:26.051,Don't you?
00:31:26.051,00:31:27.386,Course I wanna see you again.
00:31:27.386,00:31:34.685,What Freud said about the Irish is: We're the only people who are impervious to psychoanalysis.
00:31:34.685,00:31:36.854,"Hmm. Yeah, he said that."
00:31:36.854,00:31:37.937,I know he did.
00:31:37.937,00:31:41.149,So you're up shit's creek with a client list full of mick cops.
00:31:41.149,00:31:43.443,"I mean, opening up?"
00:31:43.443,00:31:45.779,"Why do you do it, then?"
00:31:45.779,00:31:46.864,Mmm...
00:31:46.864,00:31:48.532,Some people do get better.
00:31:51.951,00:31:53.453,Fair enough.
00:31:53.453,00:31:57.374,Sometimes I just want people to forget about their personal bullshit and do their jobs.
00:31:57.374,00:31:59.543,Including the criminals?
00:31:59.543,00:32:01.879,"Well, if they don't do their jobs, you don't have one."
00:32:01.879,00:32:03.922,Pfft.
00:32:03.922,00:32:06.007,I'll just arrest innocent people.
00:32:07.133,00:32:08.260,Wait. You are trouble.
00:32:08.260,00:32:09.803,"Ah, you don't know the half of it."
00:32:09.803,00:32:11.722,I'll arrest you right now.
00:32:13.139,00:32:15.559,COLIN: My word against yours.
00:32:15.559,00:32:18.604,WOMAN: Then I see her dancing at the wedding with you-know-who.
00:32:18.604,00:32:22.608,"And the other one says to him, Why don't you go up to Parents Without Partners?"
00:32:22.608,00:32:26.862,"And he goes, Ma, they're all a bunch of losers at the Parents Without Partners, so..."
00:32:29.281,00:32:31.950,"So I say to him, Princess Carolina of Monaco..."
00:32:34.327,00:32:35.995,Schuyler.
00:32:49.384,00:32:50.844,Do you know who I am?
00:32:54.973,00:32:56.099,No.
00:33:00.395,00:33:05.066,You met my friend Mr. French the other night.
00:33:14.993,00:33:16.495,His real name Mr. French?
00:33:20.373,00:33:21.541,No.
00:33:25.671,00:33:27.172,Come with me.
00:33:32.177,00:33:34.179,I'm not the cops.
00:33:34.179,00:33:35.931,Not asking ya.
00:33:39.142,00:33:43.522,"You know something, they just do not stop having the Mafia in Providence."
00:33:43.522,00:33:46.483,And this can cause me a lot of problems.
00:33:53.239,00:33:58.662,"Those guys you tuned up, they're connected down Providence."
00:33:59.872,00:34:05.168,What they're gonna do is come back with some guys and kill you.
00:34:05.168,00:34:08.380,"Which, sure as you're born, they will do."
00:34:08.380,00:34:11.008,Unless I stop them.
00:34:11.008,00:34:13.343,Do you want me to stop 'em?
00:34:16.179,00:34:18.724,Is this something I can't do personally?
00:34:22.227,00:34:24.062,I'm gonna have my associate search you.
00:34:24.062,00:34:25.522,"Nah, no one's fucking searching me."
00:34:25.522,00:34:26.732,Search me for what?
00:34:26.732,00:34:29.484,Contra-fucking-band.
00:34:29.484,00:34:31.194,Fuck.
00:34:38.159,00:34:39.953,I knew your father.
00:34:41.663,00:34:42.831,Yeah?
00:34:44.123,00:34:46.835,You know he's dead?
00:34:46.835,00:34:49.963,"Oh, sorry. How'd he go?"
00:34:49.963,00:34:51.924,Stand.
00:34:51.924,00:34:53.592,He didn't complain.
00:34:53.592,00:34:56.762,"Yeah, that was his problem."
00:34:56.762,00:34:58.764,Who said he had a problem?
00:35:00.766,00:35:03.602,I just said he had a fucking problem.
00:35:04.644,00:35:07.188,There's a man could've been anything.
00:35:07.188,00:35:09.733,Are you trying to say that he was nothing?
00:35:09.733,00:35:10.901,Fuck.
00:35:10.901,00:35:13.361,I'm saying he worked at the airport.
00:35:13.361,00:35:14.571,He's clean.
00:35:14.571,00:35:16.155,Arm.
00:35:16.155,00:35:17.156,"Yeah, come on."
00:35:17.156,00:35:18.533,What arm? What fucking arm?
00:35:18.533,00:35:21.745,Show me your arm. Flip it.
00:35:21.745,00:35:23.162,Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
00:35:23.162,00:35:26.959,Agh! Oh! Ah-ha-hah!
00:35:26.959,00:35:28.501,Fuck!
00:35:28.501,00:35:32.505,Makes me curious to see you in this neighborhood.
00:35:33.966,00:35:35.425,He's clean.
00:35:35.425,00:35:42.766,"And if I can slander my own environment, it makes me sad, this, uh, regression."
00:35:42.766,00:35:51.733,"Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some fucking cop prick like Queenan to pull you outta the staties and send you after me."
00:35:52.985,00:35:55.695,I just can't know.
00:35:55.695,00:36:00.158,"I don't know what they do in that particular department, anyway."
00:36:01.326,00:36:02.327,Are you still a cop?
00:36:02.327,00:36:04.955,No! No! Agh!
00:36:04.955,00:36:08.166,Swear on your mother's grave you're still not a cop?
00:36:08.166,00:36:11.795,I am not a fucking cop! Ow!
00:36:11.795,00:36:16.925,Are you gonna stop doing coke deals with your jerk-off fucking cousin?
00:36:16.925,00:36:19.636,"Yes. Yes, yes!"
00:36:21.138,00:36:23.431,"All right, all right, all right."
00:36:23.431,00:36:26.852,You're still okay.
00:36:26.852,00:36:29.146,Get your hand taken care of.
00:36:30.689,00:36:34.484,"I'm sorry, but, uh, it was necessary."
00:36:36.528,00:36:39.990,As for our problem with Providence...
00:36:41.074,00:36:44.161,let's not cry over spilled guineas.
00:36:46.371,00:36:49.666,Who let this IRA motherfucker in my bar?
00:36:55.130,00:36:57.174,Just kidding.
00:36:57.174,00:36:59.467,"Ah, she's on her way out."
00:36:59.467,00:37:02.679,We all are.
00:37:02.679,00:37:05.223,"Here it is, Your Highness, as ordered."
00:37:05.223,00:37:07.559,Get in the car.
00:37:07.559,00:37:09.186,What's got you all hot and bothered?
00:37:09.186,00:37:10.937,Get in the car.
00:37:10.937,00:37:13.648,Do you trust him?
00:37:14.941,00:37:16.359,"FRENCH: Well, these days, um..."
00:37:16.359,00:37:18.611,Who's reliable?
00:37:18.611,00:37:21.031,His Uncle Jackie was.
00:37:21.031,00:37:22.574,Mmm.
00:37:21.031,00:37:26.411,"Yeah, but you can't trust a guy acts like he's got nothing to lose."
00:37:30.916,00:37:32.876,I'm reliable.
00:37:32.876,00:37:37.172,"Arnold, you're one in a million."
00:37:37.172,00:37:40.133,Ten. Ten million.
00:37:41.760,00:37:43.845,"What about your wife, Arnold?"
00:37:46.973,00:37:48.725,"Well, I thought she was."
00:37:49.350,00:37:52.104,She wasn't.
00:37:54.147,00:37:55.607,"Well, she got reliable."
00:37:58.026,00:38:01.279,GWEN: Don't you people ever shut the fuck up?
00:38:02.280,00:38:04.407,Another county heard from.
00:38:04.407,00:38:06.325,One too many.
00:38:06.325,00:38:08.494,"Answer this for me, will ya?"
00:38:27.806,00:38:33.019,COLIN: Ah. The principles of detection tell me that these two gentlemen came from Providence.
00:38:33.019,00:38:34.604,"Lieutenant Risteen, Lynn P.D."
00:38:34.604,00:38:36.731,I'd appreciate it you get outta my crime scene.
00:38:36.731,00:38:39.985,"Yeah, actually, it's my crime scene, but knock yourself out."
00:38:43.321,00:38:45.073,I saw a dead guy.
00:38:45.073,00:38:47.993,I think I'm having posttraumatic stress.
00:38:47.993,00:38:49.995,Can I meet you for lunch?
00:38:49.995,00:38:51.288,"All right, see you then."
00:38:55.708,00:38:57.627,Who's the lead detective?
00:38:57.627,00:38:59.754,Good. He's a lox.
00:39:09.097,00:39:11.266,Get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas for the hit.
00:39:11.266,00:39:12.851,"Course, he had nothing to do with it."
00:39:12.851,00:39:14.769,He'll say so.
00:39:14.769,00:39:17.230,"You look in his car, you'll find the gun that did it."
00:39:17.230,00:39:19.149,Registered. Official.
00:39:19.149,00:39:21.151,In the trunk or the glove compartment?
00:39:22.694,00:39:24.863,"Hey, you wanna see some dead guys?"
00:39:27.657,00:39:29.951,MAN 2: Calm down. Let's go.
00:39:29.951,00:39:32.912,"Hey, this will get Captain Ellerby on the 6:00 news."
00:39:32.912,00:39:34.497,No wonder you get ahead.
00:39:40.419,00:39:41.671,"Have a seat, Bill."
00:39:50.138,00:39:52.349,Do you know John Lennon?
00:39:53.641,00:39:56.311,"Yeah, sure, he was the president before Lincoln."
00:39:59.272,00:40:04.069,"Lennon said, I'm an artist."
00:40:04.069,00:40:07.613,"You give me a fucking tuba, I'll get you something out of it."
00:40:12.660,00:40:16.664,"Well, I tell you, Mr. Costello, I'd like to squeeze some fucking money out of it."
00:40:24.923,00:40:26.758,Smart-mouth.
00:40:28.134,00:40:29.468,Too bad.
00:40:31.179,00:40:33.806,If you'll indulge me...
00:40:35.433,00:40:36.809,Now what?
00:40:37.977,00:40:40.272,Choir practice.
00:40:40.939,00:40:42.565,Choir practice...
00:40:47.112,00:40:49.822,The point I'm making with John Lennon is...
00:40:50.615,00:40:56.537,a man could look at anything and make something out of it.
00:40:56.537,00:41:04.212,"For instance, I look at you, and I think: What could I use you for?"
00:41:04.754,00:41:05.755,Yeah.
00:41:05.755,00:41:07.465,Get rid of this.
00:41:07.465,00:41:09.467,French.
00:41:09.467,00:41:12.345,COSTELLO: Put it downstairs. Here.
00:41:12.345,00:41:14.222,Maybe we could work something out.
00:41:14.222,00:41:15.473,Good.
00:41:15.473,00:41:18.310,"And, uh, send this to his wife."
00:41:18.310,00:41:23.398,FRENCH: I thought it was nice the way you asked the guy which hand he jerked off with.
00:41:23.398,00:41:25.108,I hope this don't shake Rita up.
00:41:26.192,00:41:28.903,"As I remember, she ain't that sentimental."
00:41:36.786,00:41:38.913,That was quick.
00:41:39.998,00:41:41.582,BILLY: We have to do it by phone.
00:41:41.582,00:41:43.626,I won't do it if I have to wear a wire.
00:41:43.626,00:41:44.836,No wires ever. You understand?
00:41:44.836,00:41:46.171,You don't know what this is like.
00:41:46.171,00:41:47.422,QUEENAN: Microprocessors.
00:41:47.422,00:41:50.049,Micro what?
00:41:50.049,00:41:56.139,We'll probably be at war with the Chinese in 20-odd years and Costello is selling them military technology.
00:41:56.139,00:41:58.641,"Microprocessors, chips, computer parts."
00:41:58.641,00:42:02.228,"Anybody says anything about anything like that, you let us know."
00:42:06.065,00:42:08.567,So who did the two guys from Providence?
00:42:08.567,00:42:11.237,Jimmy Pappas.
00:42:11.237,00:42:13.531,What happened to Jimmy Pappas?
00:42:14.407,00:42:16.784,Jimmy had a rough month. Uh...
00:42:16.784,00:42:22.581,"Jimmy had a heart attack in jail, and, uh, then he got himself knifed at, uh, Boston City Hospital."
00:42:22.581,00:42:24.750,I believe it's been in the papers.
00:42:25.710,00:42:28.046,You seem quite happy with that result.
00:42:29.255,00:42:31.590,It's a fucking result.
00:42:31.590,00:42:34.886,"Yeah, but cui bono?"
00:42:34.886,00:42:37.889,Cui gives a shit?
00:42:40.016,00:42:42.227,"I think you are a cop, my son."
00:42:44.312,00:42:46.647,Where's your fucking license?!
00:42:46.647,00:42:49.359,I don't see no fucking license.
00:42:49.359,00:42:52.778,"But you, you definitely need to have fucking one."
00:42:52.778,00:42:56.282,"If you're not being run by us, you're being run by someone else."
00:42:56.282,00:43:01.162,That means you're bringing some undesirable elements into Mr. Costello's area.
00:43:06.834,00:43:08.961,I was going for my fucking cigarettes!
00:43:08.961,00:43:10.380,Hey.
00:43:12.006,00:43:13.550,That's Jimmy Bags.
00:43:16.886,00:43:19.222,I-- He was rea-- I don't know.
00:43:19.222,00:43:20.390,What the fuck you doing?
00:43:21.599,00:43:23.768,"MAN: I'm in the hole, I pay him 2 grand a week."
00:43:23.768,00:43:25.144,"There's no profit, I pay him."
00:43:25.144,00:43:27.272,Then make more fucking money.
00:43:27.272,00:43:29.148,"You don't make money, you're a douche bag."
00:43:29.148,00:43:30.567,Now what you gonna do?
00:43:30.567,00:43:32.110,Oh! Make more money.
00:43:32.110,00:43:33.570,That's the spirit!
00:43:33.570,00:43:34.571,"Oh, fuck."
00:43:34.571,00:43:35.988,Don't worry about it.
00:43:35.988,00:43:38.575,The guy don't need any fucking teeth anyway.
00:43:38.575,00:43:41.786,"It's a small surveillance subunit, but it's mine."
00:43:41.786,00:43:44.872,And I didn't take this job to fuck it up or let anyone else fuck it up.
00:43:44.872,00:43:46.624,I handpicked this group.
00:43:46.624,00:43:49.627,You're my A team.
00:43:46.624,00:43:51.045,"Now, our prime-- Hi, captain."
00:43:51.045,00:43:53.714,This crazy fuck knocked Jimmy Bags' teeth out.
00:43:53.714,00:43:55.592,So?
00:43:53.714,00:43:57.469,"Look, he was reaching for his-- He was reaching for his cigarettes."
00:43:57.469,00:44:00.179,"You're gonna give me shit, huh?"
00:44:00.179,00:44:01.639,The man reached into his coat.
00:44:01.639,00:44:03.891,I don't know if he's a bookie or what the fuck.
00:44:03.891,00:44:06.519,"Well, you do know what a bookie does, don't you?"
00:44:06.519,00:44:08.438,"Yeah. Yeah, he pays you."
00:44:08.438,00:44:13.025,"COLIN: Queenan's compartmentalizing everything in SIU, which is the right thing to do."
00:44:13.025,00:44:15.570,"Personally, I don't trust half the troopers out there anymore."
00:44:15.570,00:44:17.071,Bottom line...
00:44:17.947,00:44:20.158,We think we might have a problem.
00:44:20.158,00:44:23.328,We think Costello's got a rat in the state police.
00:44:24.703,00:44:26.080,Really?
00:44:26.080,00:44:27.582,"Yeah, really."
00:44:27.582,00:44:29.750,Do we have direct access to Queenan's undercovers?
00:44:29.750,00:44:32.211,"No, no, not presently."
00:44:32.211,00:44:34.631,"Uh, but I'm working on that."
00:44:34.631,00:44:36.341,"Here, Bill, this is for you."
00:44:36.341,00:44:40.637,"From now on, call the bar, ask for Mikey. Just Mikey."
00:44:40.637,00:44:44.516,You ask for Mikey because there is no Mikey.
00:44:44.516,00:44:47.435,You wait. We'll call you.
00:44:47.435,00:44:49.187,FRENCH: You got that?
00:44:49.187,00:44:50.647,"FRENCH: Sorry, I didn't hear you."
00:44:50.647,00:44:53.149,I got that.
00:44:55.568,00:44:58.154,"Hi, Dad."
00:44:58.154,00:45:00.697,I got promoted. All right.
00:45:17.923,00:45:19.967,Excuse me for one second.
00:45:21.469,00:45:23.054,You know...
00:45:24.096,00:45:31.270,"if your father were alive and saw you here sitting with me, let's say he'd have a word with me about this."
00:45:31.270,00:45:34.232,"In fact, he'd kill seven guys just to cut my throat."
00:45:34.232,00:45:41.239,"And he could do it, which is maybe something you don't know about William Costigan, Sr."
00:45:45.660,00:45:49.372,So he never--?
00:45:49.372,00:45:50.540,"No. No, no."
00:45:50.540,00:45:52.458,He kept his own counsel.
00:45:52.458,00:45:54.210,He never wanted money.
00:45:54.210,00:45:56.629,Can't do anything with a man like that.
00:45:56.629,00:45:59.340,Your Uncle Jackie...
00:45:59.340,00:46:04.429,He also would kill my entire fucking family if he saw me here with you.
00:46:05.638,00:46:08.182,And I think about this.
00:46:14.522,00:46:17.567,So what the fuck are we talking about here?
00:46:17.567,00:46:21.195,Did you ever think about going back to school?
00:46:21.195,00:46:22.988,School?
00:46:25.199,00:46:29.245,"With all due respect, Mr. Costello, tsk, school is out."
00:46:29.245,00:46:30.413,Mm-hm.
00:46:30.413,00:46:33.916,Maybe someday you'll wake the fuck up.
00:46:35.543,00:46:37.002,"Good day, Fathers."
00:46:37.002,00:46:38.671,Mr. Costello.
00:46:38.671,00:46:41.132,"OLD PRIEST: Good morning, Francis, good morning."
00:46:41.132,00:46:44.135,You recall our chat?
00:46:44.135,00:46:51.392,"Little boys, sucking on their peckers, etcetera, so forth..."
00:46:51.392,00:46:53.894,I am as God made me.
00:46:55.812,00:47:01.360,"May I remind you, in this archdiocese, God don't run the bingo."
00:47:01.360,00:47:05.740,YOUNG PRIEST: May I remind you that pride comes before the fall.
00:47:07.908,00:47:11.078,How's Sister Mary Theresa doing?
00:47:11.078,00:47:15.291,We had a tasty relationship before she took her vows.
00:47:15.291,00:47:17.669,"Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers."
00:47:17.669,00:47:19.587,Pay 'em.
00:47:21.422,00:47:23.966,COSTELLO: Get the old bombardier a drink on the house.
00:47:30.389,00:47:32.475,What do you got for me?
00:47:30.389,00:47:33.934,BROWN: Uniform clipped him for a suspended license.
00:47:33.934,00:47:38.189,"However, as he's a subject of an open investigation-- More than one. Yeah."
00:47:38.189,00:47:39.691,"Yeah, we're getting a warrant."
00:47:39.691,00:47:41.275,We can't get an address off of him.
00:47:41.275,00:47:44.320,"He paged his lawyer, but the lawyer hasn't called back yet."
00:47:44.320,00:47:46.113,Who's the lawyer?
00:47:46.113,00:47:48.282,Just had a number on a card.
00:47:48.282,00:47:50.827,And the guy didn't show up?
00:47:50.827,00:47:52.036,No.
00:47:52.745,00:47:54.121,COLIN: He beeped him?
00:47:54.121,00:47:55.456,Twice.
00:47:59.335,00:48:01.379,Give me your phone.
00:48:01.379,00:48:02.714,What?
00:48:02.714,00:48:05.216,Turn the fucking camera off.
00:48:05.216,00:48:07.844,He doesn't know what the fucking lawyer looks like.
00:48:07.844,00:48:10.513,Whose briefcase is this?
00:48:10.513,00:48:11.514,You're good.
00:48:11.514,00:48:14.559,"Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons."
00:48:14.559,00:48:15.601,He can't do that.
00:48:15.601,00:48:17.019,He just did.
00:48:17.019,00:48:18.563,You my attorney?
00:48:18.563,00:48:20.022,What do you think?
00:48:21.482,00:48:25.695,"Now, have you made any statements or phone calls I need to be made aware of?"
00:48:27.488,00:48:30.241,I beeped you.
00:48:30.241,00:48:33.578,The card they gave me.
00:48:33.578,00:48:34.787,That's it?
00:48:34.787,00:48:37.331,That's it.
00:48:40.125,00:48:44.380,"I think you need to call your mother, tell her you're not gonna be home for supper."
00:48:48.760,00:48:52.680,Camera's off.
00:48:55.516,00:48:59.103,"Lookit, they're suiting up for a raid right now."
00:48:59.103,00:49:01.856,"I don't know where they're going, but they do."
00:49:01.856,00:49:03.023,And so do you.
00:49:04.734,00:49:06.569,So make the call.
00:49:10.823,00:49:14.535,"Lookit, fuckstick, you don't gotta trust me..."
00:49:15.703,00:49:18.038,just listen to what I'm saying to you.
00:49:34.764,00:49:39.852,"Mom, I'm not gonna make it home for supper."
00:49:39.852,00:49:42.104,"Sorry, yeah, I got held up."
00:49:43.940,00:49:46.525,"Yeah, no, you carry on without me."
00:49:47.568,00:49:50.738,I'll-- I'll talk to you later. Okay.
00:49:50.738,00:49:53.449,Bye.
00:49:53.449,00:49:55.534,Everybody out. Move.
00:50:13.135,00:50:14.470,Thank you.
00:50:14.971,00:50:16.681,So who are you?
00:50:16.681,00:50:20.810,"You know, I think you need a different attorney after all, Mr. Fitzgibbons-- Have a great day."
00:50:20.810,00:50:22.520,So when the fuck am I gonna get out?
00:50:22.520,00:50:26.106,"All right, run the last number he called. That's his house."
00:50:26.106,00:50:31.529,"Now, whatever the address is, I'll swear to the judge I surveilled him there, and abra-fucking-cadabra, we got a warrant."
00:50:31.529,00:50:32.571,Why did you use my phone?
00:50:32.571,00:50:34.156,'Cause you didn't go in there.
00:50:45.584,00:50:47.879,The light's nice here in the morning.
00:50:52.383,00:50:54.802,So do you want to talk about last night?
00:51:01.934,00:51:03.227,"You know, it's all right."
00:51:03.227,00:51:05.229,Guys tend to make too big a deal out of it.
00:51:10.860,00:51:12.444,It's actually quite common.
00:51:13.029,00:51:14.321,I gotta go to work.
00:51:23.831,00:51:25.416,Do you lie?
00:51:27.167,00:51:28.419,Why?
00:51:28.419,00:51:29.754,Do you?
00:51:29.754,00:51:31.087,"No, I'm asking if you lie."
00:51:32.464,00:51:35.091,Honesty is not synonymous with truth.
00:51:35.091,00:51:36.260,"Yeah, you lie."
00:51:37.428,00:51:38.930,You lie.
00:51:38.930,00:51:43.684,"Is it to do some good, to get somewhere personally, or what, just for the fuck of it?"
00:51:43.684,00:51:49.523,"Well, I expect that some people do it to keep things on an even keel."
00:51:50.357,00:51:51.525,Wow.
00:51:52.610,00:51:54.987,So you had a parent who was a drunk.
00:51:58.407,00:51:59.575,Did you?
00:52:00.576,00:52:01.702,No.
00:52:04.496,00:52:06.498,Let's keep it with you.
00:52:06.498,00:52:08.292,Talk about how you feel.
00:52:10.586,00:52:12.421,BILLY: How I feel.
00:52:13.129,00:52:15.131,How I feel.
00:52:35.945,00:52:37.947,Fuck!
00:52:42.910,00:52:43.995,No...
00:52:43.995,00:52:45.997,Please...
00:52:45.997,00:52:48.248,Ain't gonna hurt ya.
00:52:51.251,00:52:52.837,BILLY: You sit there...
00:52:52.837,00:52:55.213,with a mass murderer.
00:52:55.213,00:52:57.173,A mass murderer.
00:52:57.173,00:52:59.802,Your heart rate is jacked.
00:53:01.428,00:53:02.721,Your hand...
00:53:04.890,00:53:06.600,steady.
00:53:08.644,00:53:14.859,That's one thing I figured out about myself in prison-- My hand...
00:53:16.152,00:53:17.528,Ever.
00:53:26.620,00:53:28.914,Wake the fuck up.
00:53:30.457,00:53:33.209,There was a cop leaving when I came in.
00:53:33.209,00:53:35.587,How did you know he was a cop?
00:53:35.587,00:53:40.759,"You know, bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight, you know, air of scumbag entitlement."
00:53:40.759,00:53:41.760,Do you see cops?
00:53:41.760,00:53:43.095,As part of what I do.
00:53:43.095,00:53:46.390,"I mean, I normally don't see cadets who've been kicked out of the academy."
00:53:46.390,00:53:48.224,"Oh, boy."
00:53:48.224,00:53:49.768,"You should get a better job, huh?"
00:53:49.768,00:53:51.687,Should I?
00:53:52.730,00:53:58.318,"So do they all, uh-- They all come in here and...cry? Your cops?"
00:53:58.318,00:53:59.695,Sometimes they do.
00:53:59.695,00:54:00.779,Yeah?
00:54:00.779,00:54:02.322,"Sometimes they cry, yeah."
00:54:02.322,00:54:03.699,If they've had trouble at home.
00:54:03.699,00:54:05.743,If they've had to use their weapons.
00:54:05.743,00:54:06.785,Use their weapons?
00:54:07.953,00:54:09.329,Let me tell you somethin'.
00:54:09.329,00:54:17.504,"They signed up to use their weapons, most of them, all right, but they watch enough TV so they know they have to weep after they use their weapons."
00:54:17.504,00:54:20.883,There is no one more full of shit than a cop.
00:54:20.883,00:54:22.927,Except for a cop on TV.
00:54:30.017,00:54:32.061,"MADOLYN: I looked at your file, and..."
00:54:32.061,00:54:34.980,I see that you have-- You have a record of assault.
00:54:34.980,00:54:36.690,Yeah.
00:54:36.690,00:54:39.777,"So, what--? What was it like for you in jail?"
00:54:39.777,00:54:41.361,"What, you don't--?"
00:54:41.361,00:54:44.531,"You want to hear about the showers, is that what you want to hear about?"
00:54:44.531,00:54:46.033,Did something happen to you?
00:54:46.825,00:54:47.952,No.
00:54:51.163,00:54:52.372,"Okay, kid, let's do this."
00:54:52.372,00:54:53.665,"Come on, spread 'em."
00:54:53.665,00:54:56.961,"Hey! What, you think you can pop somebody, and there's a special card to play?"
00:54:56.961,00:55:01.173,"That guy Jimmy Bags, whose jaw you broke, works undercover for the Boston Police Department."
00:55:01.173,00:55:02.340,"I'm going fuckin' nuts, man."
00:55:02.340,00:55:03.926,I can't be someone else every day!
00:55:03.926,00:55:05.970,It's been a year.
00:55:05.970,00:55:07.303,"Calm down, all right?"
00:55:07.303,00:55:08.931,Most people in the world do it every day.
00:55:08.931,00:55:11.058,What's the big deal?
00:55:11.058,00:55:12.268,"I'm not fuckin' them, okay?"
00:55:12.268,00:55:13.393,Exactly. You're nobody.
00:55:13.393,00:55:15.104,"You signed the papers, remember?"
00:55:15.104,00:55:18.899,"Now, we're the only two people on the face of this earth that even know you're a cop."
00:55:18.899,00:55:21.277,How 'bout we just erase your file? Huh? How 'bout that?
00:55:21.277,00:55:27.825,"How 'bout we erase your file, and then bang, you're just another soldier for Costello, open to arrest for I don't know how many felonies, huh?"
00:55:27.825,00:55:29.160,"What do you say we do that, cap?"
00:55:29.160,00:55:30.702,"How 'bout I fuckin' kill you, huh?!"
00:55:30.702,00:55:32.704,How 'bout I fuckin' kill you!
00:55:32.704,00:55:34.123,That was a joke.
00:55:34.123,00:55:39.377,"Wasn't a joke-- 'Cause you play a tough guy doesn't mean you are one, you lace-curtain, Irish pussy!"
00:55:39.377,00:55:42.923,Stop it! Break it up!
00:55:42.923,00:55:44.424,"Fuck you, motherfucker!"
00:55:44.424,00:55:46.218,"Goddamn it, stop it!"
00:55:47.552,00:55:49.847,"For Christ's sake, be smart."
00:55:49.847,00:55:53.642,"If anybody's watching us now, how are we not supposed to arrest you?"
00:55:53.642,00:55:55.019,"Come on, get in the car."
00:55:55.019,00:55:56.728,"Both of you, get in the car!"
00:55:59.648,00:56:01.192,"When you gonna take Costello, huh?"
00:56:01.192,00:56:07.198,"I mean, what's wrong with taking him on any one of the million fucking felonies that you've seen him do or I've seen him do?!"
00:56:07.198,00:56:09.158,"I mean-- I mean, he murdered somebody, right?"
00:56:09.158,00:56:11.994,The guy fucking murders somebody and you don't fucking take him!
00:56:11.994,00:56:13.871,What are you waiting for?
00:56:11.994,00:56:16.081,"Honestly, I mean, do you want him to chop me up and feed me to the poor?"
00:56:16.081,00:56:17.333,Is that what you guys want?
00:56:17.333,00:56:18.583,"Yeah, well, that might stick."
00:56:18.583,00:56:20.169,Will you shut up.
00:56:20.169,00:56:22.587,"We are building a case, and it takes time."
00:56:22.587,00:56:24.006,You know that.
00:56:25.341,00:56:27.759,Something's wrong. I'm...
00:56:27.759,00:56:29.845,"I'm telling you, something's wrong."
00:56:31.596,00:56:33.349,"Yeah, maybe."
00:56:33.349,00:56:36.685,"Look, we need you to keep your ears open, all right?"
00:56:36.685,00:56:39.146,No bullshit.
00:56:39.146,00:56:42.649,We think Costello's got a spy inside the Special Investigation Unit.
00:56:44.902,00:56:46.945,Are you--? You serious?
00:56:46.945,00:56:48.697,I'm afraid so.
00:56:52.617,00:56:54.578,Have you heard anything like that?
00:56:54.578,00:56:57.373,"Aw, Jesus Christ."
00:56:58.707,00:57:01.417,"Hang tight for me, kid."
00:57:01.417,00:57:03.337,Just a little while longer.
00:57:03.337,00:57:05.505,We are this close.
00:57:07.841,00:57:09.051,All right?
00:57:10.386,00:57:12.679,"MADOLYN: What do you expect, coming in here?"
00:57:12.679,00:57:14.181,I have to come here.
00:57:14.181,00:57:18.727,"I know you have to come here, but now that you're here..."
00:57:18.727,00:57:19.937,what do you want?
00:57:20.979,00:57:22.731,You want the truth?
00:57:24.191,00:57:25.817,Valium.
00:57:25.817,00:57:30.072,"Oh. You know, if you lied, you would have an easier time getting what you wanted."
00:57:30.072,00:57:31.907,What's that say about what you do for a living?
00:57:31.907,00:57:34.451,We need more meetings before we talk about prescriptions.
00:57:34.451,00:57:36.578,"I'm having panic attacks, all right?"
00:57:36.578,00:57:39.081,"The other night, I thought I was having a fucking heart attack."
00:57:39.081,00:57:42.084,I puked in a trash barrel on the way over here.
00:57:42.084,00:57:43.585,I haven't slept for fucking weeks.
00:57:43.585,00:57:45.587,Is that true?
00:57:45.587,00:57:47.089,I said something fuckin' true.
00:57:47.089,00:57:49.091,"I want some fuckin' pills, and you're gonna, what?"
00:57:49.091,00:57:51.593,You're gonna close my file?
00:57:51.593,00:57:52.719,I didn't mean to close it.
00:57:52.719,00:57:56.848,"I thought I was supposed to tell the truth here, if only fucking here!"
00:57:56.848,00:58:02.896,"Christ, I mean a guy comes in here against ev-- Every instinct of-- Of privacy, of self-reliance that he has, and what do you do?"
00:58:02.896,00:58:05.482,You send him off on the street to score smack?
00:58:05.482,00:58:08.360,Is that what you do?
00:58:17.161,00:58:18.287,Two pills?
00:58:19.579,00:58:24.251,Great. Why don't you just give me a bottle of Scotch and a handgun to blow my fuckin' head off.
00:58:24.251,00:58:26.503,Are we done here with this psychiatry bullshit--?
00:58:26.503,00:58:28.422,You know what? You can leave!
00:58:26.503,00:58:30.590,What the fuck did I just put myself through?
00:58:30.590,00:58:32.509,And what if that was a legitimate threat?
00:58:32.509,00:58:34.761,"Think about it, fuckin' hotshot."
00:58:35.887,00:58:37.097,Fuck.
00:58:46.564,00:58:49.067,Why is the last patient of the day always the hardest one?
00:58:49.067,00:58:51.236,It's 'cause you're tired and you don't give a shit.
00:58:51.236,00:58:52.279,It's not supernatural.
00:58:52.279,00:58:54.198,Listen... Listen.
00:58:54.198,00:58:58.452,"You know, I'm not just somebody that you have to see, or they put you in jail."
00:58:58.452,00:59:01.579,"Okay? I mean, if you're in distress, I will help you."
00:59:03.165,00:59:04.124,What's this?
00:59:04.124,00:59:08.753,It's my card and a prescription for 20 lorazepam.
00:59:08.753,00:59:10.422,Yeah?
00:59:10.422,00:59:11.882,Is it enough to commit suicide?
00:59:11.882,00:59:13.509,Maybe it is.
00:59:13.509,00:59:14.968,All right? Okay?
00:59:14.968,00:59:17.137,Have I done my job up to your goddamn standards?
00:59:17.137,00:59:21.183,"Because according to my standards, you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior."
00:59:21.183,00:59:25.312,"You know, and too damn bad if you don't like my initial clinical reaction."
00:59:25.312,00:59:26.438,Thank you.
00:59:27.523,00:59:30.317,I'm transferring you to another counselor.
00:59:30.317,00:59:31.735,Good.
00:59:33.737,00:59:36.281,So you want to get a cup of coffee?
00:59:41.619,00:59:43.705,"ELLERBY: Bring it in here, please."
00:59:43.705,00:59:45.874,Would somebody bring it in?
00:59:45.874,00:59:47.918,Come on in.
00:59:47.918,00:59:51.796,Our target is a major transaction of microprocessors.
00:59:51.796,00:59:53.715,"Yes, those."
00:59:53.715,00:59:56.134,"I don't know what they are, you don't know what they are."
00:59:56.134,00:59:58.303,Who gives a fuck? Cash.
00:59:58.303,01:00:02.849,Lots of cash are gonna change hands inside a building that we have under AV surveillance close-by.
01:00:02.849,01:00:06.395,"I know this off-site location is not the best, but we've had very little time to set up."
01:00:06.395,01:00:08.188,Did you guys know anything about this?
01:00:08.188,01:00:09.440,No.
01:00:09.440,01:00:13.193,ELLERBY: Staff Sergeant Sullivan's team will ID the bad guys and listen in on the phones.
01:00:13.193,01:00:14.528,Our unit will not take action.
01:00:14.528,01:00:19.657,"I repeat, not take action, until a man that Captain Queenan has inside their operation verifies the transaction."
01:00:19.657,01:00:20.700,Are we clear?
01:00:20.700,01:00:23.912,Anybody?
01:00:23.912,01:00:25.581,This is who we're after.
01:00:25.581,01:00:29.460,"We've been after this cocksucker for a long time, and tonight, we are going to get him."
01:00:29.460,01:00:31.336,Let's go to work.
01:00:31.336,01:00:33.338,You guys find out what we're doing and get on it.
01:00:33.338,01:00:34.965,Hey.
01:00:33.338,01:00:36.841,"I'm sorry to get you at the last minute, but things leak."
01:00:36.841,01:00:38.843,This lead came from Queenan's undercover guy.
01:00:38.843,01:00:40.720,I'm gonna have a smoke.
01:00:40.720,01:00:43.307,Are you one of those fitness freaks? Go fuck yourself.
01:00:48.562,01:00:49.687,"Hi, Dad?"
01:00:49.687,01:00:50.772,Yes.
01:00:50.772,01:00:51.982,"Uh, yeah..."
01:00:51.982,01:00:53.275,Something big came up at work.
01:00:53.275,01:00:54.734,I'm not gonna be home for supper.
01:00:54.734,01:00:55.944,Too bad.
01:00:55.944,01:00:58.738,Your mother worked all goddamn day.
01:00:58.738,01:01:02.367,We'll just have to sit down without you and your friends.
01:01:02.367,01:01:04.286,"Oh, no."
01:01:07.705,01:01:09.166,"So we'll just, uh..."
01:01:09.166,01:01:11.084,I'll see you for lunch instead tomorrow.
01:01:11.084,01:01:13.753,Your mother will be proud.
01:01:13.753,01:01:15.755,"All right, thanks, Pop. Bye."
01:01:15.755,01:01:19.092,The readiness is all.
01:01:19.092,01:01:22.429,You know the players.
01:01:24.389,01:01:25.849,Thank you.
01:01:26.600,01:01:28.059,You ready?
01:01:28.059,01:01:32.648,"Is Your Highness gonna drop me off at confession before work, or fuck me or what?"
01:01:32.648,01:01:35.817,What have you got to confess to that anointed pederast?
01:01:35.817,01:01:38.403,"A confessional seal, these days..."
01:01:38.403,01:01:40.322,I'm not so sure.
01:01:44.660,01:01:46.620,MAN: Piece of cake.
01:01:46.620,01:01:48.079,You ID the guys and log 'em.
01:01:48.079,01:01:53.877,"All cell phone signals are under surveillance, through the courtesy of our federal friends over there."
01:01:56.087,01:01:57.714,Patriot Act. Patriot Act!
01:01:57.714,01:02:00.175,"I love it, I love it, I love it!"
01:02:02.844,01:02:04.555,Keep an eye on this one.
01:02:39.464,01:02:41.174,All right. Here we go.
01:02:44.302,01:02:46.888,"There's Costello, Mr. French."
01:02:46.888,01:02:51.184,"There's Fitzy, Delahunt and the new guy, Billy Costigan."
01:02:57.566,01:02:59.359,Time is...10:46.
01:03:01.570,01:03:04.364,"COSTELLO: All right, turn off your cell phones."
01:03:04.364,01:03:05.823,Fitzy's got the chicken.
01:03:05.823,01:03:07.534,Check your weapons.
01:03:30.014,01:03:31.808,We have a blind spot.
01:03:31.808,01:03:33.226,Why do we have a blind spot?
01:03:33.226,01:03:35.270,We had two hours' notice.
01:03:35.270,01:03:36.980,"What the fuck you think this is, NASA?"
01:03:36.980,01:03:38.189,It never crossed my mind.
01:03:38.189,01:03:39.691,Have you got a camera in the back?
01:03:39.691,01:03:41.318,What back?
01:03:48.199,01:03:49.785,"How ya going, Robert?"
01:03:49.785,01:03:50.786,"Good, Mr. Costello."
01:03:50.786,01:03:54.080,"I want to tell you, at least two of these gents have machine guns."
01:04:08.094,01:04:09.554,He's from the Chinese government.
01:04:09.554,01:04:11.055,"I mean, he's scared shitless."
01:04:11.055,01:04:12.974,COSTELLO: Government man.
01:04:12.974,01:04:14.267,Scared.
01:04:14.267,01:04:24.027,I'm concerned about a Chinaman who thinks it's wise to come to a business transaction with automatic weapons.
01:04:29.240,01:04:30.659,"Yap, yap, yap."
01:04:30.659,01:04:36.748,"COSTELLO: For his own good, tell Bruce Lee and the karate kids none of us are carrying automatic weapons."
01:04:36.748,01:04:44.964,"Because here, in this country, it don't add inches to your dick, you get a life sentence for it."
01:05:01.398,01:05:06.069,"Yeah, maybe if we had some of that Homeland Security money, like some other fucking douche bags I could mention."
01:05:06.069,01:05:07.237,Any calls?
01:05:07.237,01:05:08.780,They turned off their cell phones.
01:05:08.780,01:05:11.282,Search randomly for calls made from the area.
01:05:11.282,01:05:13.577,Eight hundred and seven phones are live in this area.
01:05:13.577,01:05:15.036,ELLERBY: Then narrow the area.
01:05:15.036,01:05:18.331,LAZIO: What you see there for service is what you're gonna get.
01:05:18.331,01:05:20.417,"Yeah, why the fuck did they turn their phones off?"
01:05:20.417,01:05:22.586,Wait. There's still one phone up.
01:05:22.586,01:05:23.754,Where?
01:05:35.265,01:05:36.974,The buyers are there.
01:05:40.771,01:05:44.649,"You know, direct contact with your guys would have its advantages."
01:05:44.649,01:05:46.401,Not to my guy.
01:05:46.401,01:05:47.819,DIGNAM: This is unbelievable.
01:05:47.819,01:05:49.696,Who put the fucking cameras in this place?
01:05:49.696,01:05:51.865,"Oh, who the fuck are you?"
01:05:51.865,01:05:54.325,I'm the guy who does his job.
01:05:57.995,01:06:05.545,"If these Chinks want to nuke Taiwan any time in this century, they better shape up and show me 1 million dollars."
01:06:10.842,01:06:14.638,What we generally do-- In this country!
01:06:14.638,01:06:23.313,"--is one guy brings the items, and the other guy...pays him."
01:06:26.483,01:06:31.279,"No tickee, no laundry."
01:06:40.163,01:06:41.623,"COSTELLO: Go ahead, Fitz."
01:06:58.389,01:07:01.977,"ELLERBY: Cars are moving, but did you see anybody come out?"
01:07:01.977,01:07:05.271,Please tell me those cars aren't empty.
01:07:05.271,01:07:09.233,"I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, please tell me that those Chinamen's cars aren't empty!"
01:07:14.823,01:07:17.283,They didn't figure we had a navy.
01:07:23.414,01:07:25.542,Did you put a camera in the back?
01:07:27.627,01:07:30.213,"Can I talk to you for a second, please?"
01:07:32.215,01:07:33.884,You stupid fucking hard-on!
01:07:33.884,01:07:35.218,"COLIN: Hey, oh, oh, oh!"
01:07:35.218,01:07:37.053,ELLERBY: You fucked this whole thing up!
01:07:37.053,01:07:39.389,"What the fuck did you do, you cocksucker?!"
01:07:39.389,01:07:41.349,Let go of me!
01:07:39.389,01:07:43.727,"I'm gonna rip your fucking arm off and shove it up your fucking ass, you hear me?!"
01:07:43.727,01:07:46.396,DIGNAM: Why don't we just meet up?
01:07:46.396,01:07:48.982,BILLY: I'm getting on a plane unless you put Queenan on.
01:07:48.982,01:07:51.860,Queenan had a funeral to go to.
01:07:51.860,01:07:54.070,"BILLY: Why shouldn't I get on a fucking plane, huh?"
01:07:54.070,01:07:56.823,Meet up?
01:07:56.823,01:07:58.575,"Look, there is a rat in your unit."
01:07:58.575,01:07:59.826,"That is a fact, all right?!"
01:07:59.826,01:08:01.244,Where's Queenan?
01:08:01.244,01:08:03.162,They knew you had cameras inside.
01:08:03.162,01:08:06.791,"They knew everything, all right?"
01:08:06.791,01:08:08.125,"It's real, man. Smoke him out."
01:08:08.125,01:08:12.338,"Yeah, how do we do that, Mr. Fucking-Genius- Who-Didn't-Even-Graduate- From-the-Academy?"
01:08:12.338,01:08:17.427,"Disinform, all right? Let it slip through SIU that you have a sealed wiretap warrant for Costello's apartment."
01:08:17.427,01:08:20.430,"Don't tell anyone in our division, but tell SIU."
01:08:20.430,01:08:23.433,"Flush it down the pipe, and see if it comes out on my end, all right?"
01:08:23.433,01:08:25.309,That's what we do first.
01:08:25.309,01:08:26.644,"Where the fuck is Queenan, huh?"
01:08:26.644,01:08:28.438,"He's not here, all right?"
01:08:28.438,01:08:31.148,"You want to meet up or you got something real, call me back."
01:08:37.697,01:08:41.076,...changing your life radically.
01:08:41.076,01:08:42.285,"Change anything, right?"
01:08:42.285,01:08:43.578,Change everything.
01:08:43.578,01:08:45.121,Right?
01:08:48.083,01:08:50.543,Ahem. How long you been with this guy?
01:08:51.711,01:08:52.754,My boyfriend?
01:08:52.754,01:08:54.547,Yeah.
01:08:54.547,01:08:57.759,About...
01:08:57.759,01:08:59.594,Four months.
01:09:00.470,01:09:01.721,Do you love him?
01:09:04.265,01:09:06.101,"It's a pretty serious relationship, yeah."
01:09:06.101,01:09:08.352,Hmm.
01:09:08.352,01:09:12.273,"Is he a head case like me, or...I'm just curious."
01:09:12.273,01:09:15.276,"Well, no more than I am."
01:09:15.276,01:09:17.445,I know that it's a serious relationship.
01:09:17.445,01:09:19.739,"I know there are ups and downs, right?"
01:09:19.739,01:09:22.826,People have doubts and problems and...
01:09:22.826,01:09:26.121,"Well, not problems, but...doubts."
01:09:29.290,01:09:34.045,"What would you do if he was standing right there and he saw us, huh?"
01:09:38.424,01:09:40.593,I would lie.
01:09:40.593,01:09:41.886,"Yeah, I would lie."
01:09:41.886,01:09:43.138,You know...
01:09:43.138,01:09:45.556,"keep things on an even keel, right?"
01:09:45.556,01:09:47.892,Right?
01:09:47.892,01:09:49.393,Yeah.
01:09:53.189,01:09:54.190,Morning.
01:09:54.190,01:09:55.399,Good morning.
01:09:55.399,01:09:56.860,Want a French donut?
01:09:56.860,01:09:59.195,Yeah.
01:10:01.072,01:10:02.991,"Hey, can I look at...?"
01:10:02.991,01:10:04.742,Sure.
01:10:07.037,01:10:08.621,"All right, we're not having this out."
01:10:08.621,01:10:09.914,What?
01:10:09.914,01:10:12.208,"Hey, you don't see any pictures of where I came from."
01:10:12.208,01:10:16.546,"Look, I respect who you are, just, you know, not in the living room."
01:10:16.546,01:10:18.214,We might have company.
01:10:18.214,01:10:19.966,Company?
01:10:20.925,01:10:23.427,"Hey, now why do you work for the state?"
01:10:23.427,01:10:24.428,Why not? You do.
01:10:24.428,01:10:28.432,"No, what you do, the degrees and all, everything you got, you're hot shit."
01:10:28.432,01:10:29.893,Yeah?
01:10:29.893,01:10:32.812,So why do you make as much as a guidance counselor?
01:10:32.812,01:10:36.691,Because I believe in public service.
01:10:38.026,01:10:39.903,So now you're gonna fuck with me?
01:10:39.903,01:10:41.654,"So now you're going to be ridiculous, huh?"
01:10:41.654,01:10:43.573,"Huh? No, don't start with me."
01:10:43.573,01:10:44.741,Hey!
01:10:45.616,01:10:47.451,"Ah, fuck with the fucking phone!"
01:10:47.451,01:10:48.578,Stop it!
01:10:48.578,01:10:50.080,The phone...
01:10:50.080,01:10:51.789,"No, get it."
01:10:51.789,01:10:54.291,This is-- This is your first phone call in the new house.
01:10:54.291,01:10:56.711,You live here now.
01:10:58.629,01:11:00.339,Mayor Sullivan's office.
01:11:00.339,01:11:03.634,Put Colin on the phone right now.
01:11:03.634,01:11:04.969,"Oh, my God. I'm sorry."
01:11:04.969,01:11:06.012,What?
01:11:06.888,01:11:09.182,"I think it's a guy with, uh..."
01:11:09.182,01:11:11.142,It's like a can-- A cancer guy.
01:11:12.143,01:11:13.477,Hello.
01:11:13.477,01:11:17.815,"What the fuck is it with you and your phone, huh?"
01:11:17.815,01:11:19.400,Um....something for work.
01:11:19.400,01:11:23.320,"Hey, um...nothing, nothing, nothing. It went dead."
01:11:23.320,01:11:27.366,I don't know. I gu-- Was that that shrink cunt that answered the phone?
01:11:25.240,01:11:29.869,"Remember I told you that, you know, we were gonna-- She was gonna move in."
01:11:29.869,01:11:31.454,Yeah.
01:11:31.454,01:11:32.830,"You better get organized, quick."
01:11:32.830,01:11:36.251,"Hey, last time I checked, I tipped you off, and you're not in jail."
01:11:36.251,01:11:38.920,Are you listening to me?
01:11:38.920,01:11:40.588,Yeah.
01:11:40.588,01:11:43.591,Do you like Little Miss Thing sucking on your cock?
01:11:47.262,01:11:48.638,"Yes. Yes, I do."
01:11:48.638,01:11:50.723,So earn it.
01:11:50.723,01:11:53.851,I'm getting the feeling...
01:11:53.851,01:11:55.436,we got a cop in my crew.
01:11:55.436,01:11:58.148,"Yeah, I know. I'm kind of getting that feeling too."
01:11:58.148,01:12:00.984,He's one of yours. Inside.
01:12:00.984,01:12:03.027,You seen anything?
01:12:00.984,01:12:04.403,"Frank, I got no access to Queenan's undercover files."
01:12:04.403,01:12:05.780,He and Dignam run the snitches.
01:12:05.780,01:12:07.615,"I'm doing my best, Frank-- Your best?"
01:12:07.615,01:12:10.493,"What do you think, we're in the fucking haberdashery business?"
01:12:10.493,01:12:15.248,"All right, look, Frank, if you don't relax-- If you don't relax, I can't relax, all right?"
01:12:15.248,01:12:19.919,"Now what I need you to do, you get me information on the people who were with you last night, your crew."
01:12:19.919,01:12:26.467,"Get me Social Security numbers, full names-- Get you? Give you?"
01:12:26.467,01:12:27.677,"All right, all right, all right."
01:12:27.677,01:12:29.220,Frank. Frank. Frank.
01:12:29.220,01:12:37.770,"I'm sorry. I didn't-- If you could please-- I need SS numbers, DOB's, just all the pedigree information, so I can run it on my end, and we can ID the prick."
01:12:37.770,01:12:41.524,"If you can get me that, I can just run-- We're gonna handle it."
01:12:41.524,01:12:42.525,I can handle it.
01:12:42.525,01:12:44.777,"Collie, calm down or you'll shoot in your pants."
01:12:44.777,01:12:48.447,"I'll get you the records and whatnot, but listen to me, son."
01:12:48.447,01:12:56.372,"Don't disappoint me on this, or some other guy will be putting their fat cock up Little Miss Freud's ass."
01:13:02.837,01:13:04.881,"QUEENAN: How are you, Francis?"
01:13:10.594,01:13:12.388,My mother called me Francis.
01:13:12.388,01:13:14.098,I know she did.
01:13:14.098,01:13:16.976,And your father called you the tumor.
01:13:16.976,01:13:19.979,"And what did your father call you, Charlie?"
01:13:19.979,01:13:22.815,"Oh, yeah, I forgot."
01:13:22.815,01:13:24.067,He wasn't around.
01:13:24.067,01:13:26.402,You have a boss that has a laryngectomy?
01:13:26.402,01:13:27.695,"No, no, no, no."
01:13:27.695,01:13:30.531,That was a guy who works for me.
01:13:30.531,01:13:32.075,You're lying to me.
01:13:33.409,01:13:35.745,Not exactly.
01:13:35.745,01:13:39.374,"What did you do with the real microprocessors, Frank?"
01:13:39.374,01:13:42.919,Microprocessors.
01:13:42.919,01:13:44.254,"Oh, yeah."
01:13:44.254,01:13:45.296,I heard the story.
01:13:45.296,01:13:51.135,You arrested some Chinese government guys at the border carrying some light sockets or somethin'.
01:13:52.636,01:13:55.556,I can't wait to wipe that fucking smirk right off of your face.
01:13:55.556,01:13:58.893,Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for me?
01:13:58.893,01:14:03.106,"Look, there are certain parts of my job that I'm not gonna be able to talk to you about."
01:14:03.106,01:14:08.152,And I cannot allow you to jeopardize an ongoing investigation.
01:14:08.152,01:14:10.571,Or your life.
01:14:10.571,01:14:12.823,"No, really, there are things..."
01:14:12.823,01:14:14.450,you don't even want to know about.
01:14:14.450,01:14:16.619,"Okay, then just say that."
01:14:17.870,01:14:20.290,"All right, I will."
01:14:20.290,01:14:23.584,"Oh, that's the movers."
01:14:23.584,01:14:25.128,"Yeah, you still want to stay?"
01:14:25.711,01:14:27.130,Yes.
01:14:28.172,01:14:29.840,Come on! I'm coming!
01:14:29.840,01:14:31.968,That's the worst timing.
01:14:31.968,01:14:34.470,I'm gonna get you.
01:14:35.596,01:14:38.308,"If you coulda, you woulda."
01:14:38.308,01:14:42.145,But I guess you like to go at your own pace.
01:14:42.145,01:14:46.107,Excuse me.
01:14:54.407,01:14:57.743,Frankie! Frankie!
01:14:58.869,01:15:01.038,Your mother forgives me.
01:15:05.209,01:15:07.920,You take off an armored car at the Dedham Mall.
01:15:07.920,01:15:10.047,"What the fuck do you do, you pay guineas in Providence?"
01:15:10.047,01:15:11.132,Fucking now I do!
01:15:11.132,01:15:13.009,What the fuck do you do?!
01:15:13.009,01:15:15.511,I gotta pay Costello and wait for him to trade me to the FBI?
01:15:15.511,01:15:16.471,That's what he does!
01:15:17.596,01:15:20.266,"FBI? Wha--? What the fuck you talking about, FBI?"
01:15:23.644,01:15:25.188,"Oh, my God, is that French out there?"
01:15:25.188,01:15:27.564,"What the fuck did you just say about the FBI, huh?"
01:15:27.564,01:15:29.233,Forget what I said.
01:15:30.193,01:15:37.158,"Whatever may be going on in that very fucking poor, very limited brain of yours, I am not gonna hurt you, all right?"
01:15:37.158,01:15:39.243,Just tell me what you just fucking said.
01:15:39.243,01:15:40.244,Forget it. I'm high.
01:15:40.244,01:15:41.620,I'm high.
01:15:41.620,01:15:43.331,I would never say what you thought I said.
01:15:43.331,01:15:45.041,Oh! Fuck!
01:15:45.041,01:15:48.585,"Now, what the fuck did you just fucking say?!"
01:15:48.585,01:15:50.296,Why do you think he never gets busted?
01:15:50.296,01:15:52.756,Costello's a protected FBI informant!
01:15:52.756,01:15:55.301,He'll trade you out!
01:15:55.301,01:15:58.471,I thought I was supposed to go into shock.
01:15:58.471,01:16:01.724,I'm not in shock.
01:16:01.724,01:16:03.600,It fucking hurts!
01:16:12.735,01:16:14.653,Hey. It's me.
01:16:14.653,01:16:16.655,What're you doing here?
01:16:18.324,01:16:22.119,Costello's giving people up to the FBI.
01:16:22.119,01:16:23.371,The FBI?
01:16:23.371,01:16:26.749,He is giving information to the FBI.
01:16:26.749,01:16:28.543,He's a protected fucking informant.
01:16:28.543,01:16:32.713,"I mean, aren't they always trying to make it a federal case and it never gets made?"
01:16:34.424,01:16:35.466,Go around the back.
01:16:35.466,01:16:37.468,I'll open the door.
01:16:41.264,01:16:43.807,Here's some ice water.
01:16:49.272,01:16:51.232,That's my son Patrick.
01:16:51.232,01:16:53.276,Goes to Notre Dame.
01:16:54.235,01:16:55.652,"Oh, yeah?"
01:16:54.235,01:16:56.946,"My wife's asleep, but she left some supper out."
01:16:56.946,01:16:59.823,You want something to eat?
01:16:59.823,01:17:01.658,"Yeah, come on, you have some supper."
01:17:01.658,01:17:03.327,We'll talk in the kitchen.
01:17:03.327,01:17:04.912,Come on.
01:17:40.739,01:17:42.283,COSTELLO: Want some coke?
01:17:47.163,01:17:49.206,There it is.
01:17:50.040,01:17:51.959,Don't move till you're numb.
01:18:07.224,01:18:08.976,"Come on, get inside."
01:18:11.895,01:18:14.398,Boss wants your real name.
01:18:14.398,01:18:17.527,"Your social and license number, your bank account numbers."
01:18:17.527,01:18:19.820,I don't have a bank account.
01:18:19.820,01:18:21.113,I'm a cash business myself.
01:18:21.113,01:18:23.240,"What's he doing, setting up IRAs?"
01:18:23.240,01:18:24.575,Just fill the fucking paper in.
01:18:24.575,01:18:27.370,Your real name and all your account numbers.
01:18:27.370,01:18:28.538,Then we wait here.
01:18:29.872,01:18:31.415,You're shittin' me.
01:18:31.415,01:18:33.000,"No, I ain't."
01:18:44.011,01:18:46.305,Put the forms in there.
01:18:50.142,01:18:55.022,"I don't know if this is how you spell citizens, but-- But fuck it, you know?"
01:18:55.022,01:18:58.275,"No, no, no, no, no."
01:19:02.779,01:19:04.990,"What, are you fuckin' retarded or something?"
01:19:04.990,01:19:06.325,That ain't fuckin' right.
01:19:06.325,01:19:08.827,Are you kidding me?
01:19:08.827,01:19:10.287,Look at this. Look.
01:19:10.287,01:19:13.082,Citizens. Look.
01:19:13.082,01:19:15.543,"Billy, he said to stay here."
01:19:15.543,01:19:17.587,I'm not sitting here without a tetanus shot.
01:19:17.587,01:19:21.048,Where the fuck you going?
01:19:21.048,01:19:23.634,You can tell him I said that.
01:19:42.319,01:19:43.696,Hey.
01:19:43.696,01:19:44.988,Hi.
01:19:46.823,01:19:47.991,Pouring out there.
01:19:47.991,01:19:48.825,Yeah.
01:19:55.750,01:19:57.334,"Look, if... Ahem."
01:19:57.334,01:20:02.339,"If this is inappropriate, I-- No, no, it's not inappropriate, you're not a patient."
01:20:04.759,01:20:07.261,"So, uh, you moving out or you moving in?"
01:20:07.261,01:20:10.222,I've still got three weeks left on the lease.
01:20:18.481,01:20:20.274,That's me.
01:20:23.193,01:20:25.613,"Yeah, I know."
01:20:31.494,01:20:33.287,Hedging your bets?
01:20:33.287,01:20:35.456,No. No.
01:20:35.456,01:20:37.207,You have to choose.
01:20:37.207,01:20:38.917,"No, you have to make a..."
01:20:38.917,01:20:39.918,A decision.
01:20:39.918,01:20:41.629,A decision and-- Right.
01:20:41.629,01:20:44.757,"And, you know, you have to stick by what you choose, you have to..."
01:20:44.757,01:20:46.467,Move in with your boyfriend?
01:20:46.467,01:20:48.427,"Yes, otherwise, it's-- It's..."
01:20:49.470,01:20:50.513,"Oh, I know, I know."
01:20:50.513,01:20:52.264,I know.
01:21:03.233,01:21:06.278,I have to say your vulnerability is...
01:21:06.278,01:21:08.781,really freaking me out right now.
01:21:13.076,01:21:15.663,Is it real?
01:21:19.208,01:21:20.793,I think so.
01:21:26.882,01:21:29.009,You don't have any cats.
01:21:29.009,01:21:30.260,No.
01:21:31.679,01:21:32.929,I like that.
01:22:45.836,01:22:47.045,I don't get it.
01:22:47.671,01:22:49.089,Well...
01:22:49.089,01:22:53.969,we are all convinced that Costello has at least one mole inside the Special Investigations Unit.
01:22:53.969,01:22:55.721,Right.
01:22:55.721,01:22:58.599,You will investigate everybody and...
01:22:58.599,01:23:00.058,anybody.
01:23:00.058,01:23:02.269,"Well, that's..."
01:23:02.269,01:23:04.396,not exactly a dream job for a cop.
01:23:04.396,01:23:08.400,We looked at all possible candidates-- You have an immaculate record.
01:23:08.400,01:23:10.694,Some people don't trust a guy with an immaculate record.
01:23:10.694,01:23:13.238,I do.
01:23:14.239,01:23:15.449,How's your wedding coming?
01:23:15.449,01:23:17.534,Great. Great.
01:23:17.534,01:23:18.869,She's a doctor.
01:23:18.869,01:23:20.412,"Oh, that's outstanding."
01:23:20.412,01:23:21.914,Yeah.
01:23:21.914,01:23:23.916,Marriage is an important part of getting ahead.
01:23:23.916,01:23:25.417,Lets people know you're not a homo.
01:23:25.417,01:23:26.836,Married guy seems more stable.
01:23:26.836,01:23:30.130,"People see the ring, they think at least somebody can stand the son of a bitch."
01:23:30.130,01:23:33.634,"Ladies see the ring, they know you must have cash and your cock must work."
01:23:33.634,01:23:36.303,"Yeah, it's working."
01:23:36.303,01:23:37.429,Overtime.
01:23:37.429,01:23:40.182,I'm glad to hear that.
01:24:11.797,01:24:13.340,WOMAN: Yeah.
01:24:13.340,01:24:14.758,WOMAN: Yeah!
01:24:28.605,01:24:31.441,"Be dirty, be dirty..."
01:24:41.869,01:24:43.119,You fuckin'...
01:24:43.119,01:24:44.705,What the fuck is wrong with you?
01:24:44.705,01:24:47.290,"See anything you like, Colin?"
01:24:47.290,01:24:48.542,I almost fuckin' shot you.
01:24:48.542,01:24:51.127,"COSTELLO: Not abusing yourself, are you?"
01:24:51.127,01:24:55.925,I hope you're not turning into one of them sob sisters who wants to get caught.
01:24:55.925,01:24:57.968,"You're not cracking up, are ya?"
01:24:57.968,01:25:00.637,I don't crack up.
01:24:57.968,01:25:02.598,Pick a place like this where any cop could see you.
01:25:02.598,01:25:04.140,Jesus.
01:25:02.598,01:25:06.977,"If this is such a fuckin' bad idea, why'd you show up?"
01:25:06.977,01:25:09.312,I own the place.
01:25:11.231,01:25:12.608,Why am I not fuckin' surprised?
01:25:16.653,01:25:19.073,You're getting reassigned.
01:25:19.073,01:25:21.366,How the fuck do you know that?
01:25:21.366,01:25:22.785,Where'd they put you?
01:25:22.785,01:25:27.539,"Hey, Frank, I gotta find myself."
01:25:27.539,01:25:29.249,"You're telling me, sonny boy."
01:25:29.249,01:25:32.294,I gotta find the guy you got in the department.
01:25:32.294,01:25:39.969,"With everybody looking up their own ass and you looking for yourself, I put my money on nobody finds nothing."
01:25:37.424,01:25:41.553,"I know, but, Frank, look, Mm-hmm?"
01:25:41.553,01:25:43.097,you gotta lay low.
01:25:43.097,01:25:44.014,Right now.
01:25:44.014,01:25:48.936,"Collie, laying low is not what I do."
01:25:48.936,01:25:50.646,Fucking perfect.
01:25:50.646,01:25:52.815,What good am I to you if you don't listen to me?
01:26:00.072,01:26:02.950,"COLIN: Queenan is compartmentalizing, splitting everything up."
01:26:02.950,01:26:04.868,He's fucking smart.
01:26:04.868,01:26:06.244,I can get the rat.
01:26:06.244,01:26:08.747,"You just gotta let me do it my way, Frank."
01:26:11.917,01:26:13.460,Okay.
01:26:16.505,01:26:28.558,"COSTELLO: But, Colin, I hope I won't have to remind you that if you don't find that cheese-eating rat bastard in your department, most likely, it won't be me who suffers for it."
01:26:28.558,01:26:32.062,"Now, why would you have to remind me of that?"
01:26:32.062,01:26:37.359,Would I--? Would I be any good at what I do if I didn't fucking already know that?
01:26:37.359,01:26:39.945,"Frank, you got to trust me."
01:26:39.945,01:26:41.989,"All right? Just-- Just trust me, Frank."
01:26:43.907,01:26:48.578,"Hey, it fucking involves lying, and I'm pretty fucking good at that, right?"
01:26:48.578,01:26:50.580,Right?
01:26:50.580,01:26:58.088,Maybe because it's always been so easy for me to get cunt that I never understood jerking off in a theater.
01:26:58.088,01:27:01.341,"Oh, yeah. Keep doing that."
01:27:04.511,01:27:06.221,Christ.
01:27:07.681,01:27:10.100,Who knows what's easy?
01:27:11.434,01:27:12.895,Colin...
01:27:12.895,01:27:16.314,I know you'll take care of business.
01:28:00.943,01:28:02.152,Shit!
01:28:40.523,01:28:42.776,Fuck.
01:30:00.520,01:30:02.605,"Hey, how you doing?"
01:30:02.605,01:30:04.233,"Hi, Darlene. Hi."
01:30:08.904,01:30:10.239,That's it for me.
01:30:10.239,01:30:12.157,"DARLENE: Yeah, see ya."
01:30:35.638,01:30:38.225,Smell a rat.
01:30:44.314,01:30:45.982,Jesus Christ.
01:30:45.982,01:30:48.777,You got a girlfriend?
01:30:50.486,01:30:52.239,No.
01:30:52.239,01:30:54.532,"No, no, why--? Why?"
01:30:54.532,01:30:57.702,Depends.
01:30:59.329,01:31:03.708,"I'm sure, by now, you know..."
01:31:03.708,01:31:07.170,I got an informer in my outfit.
01:31:07.170,01:31:09.298,Cop...
01:31:09.298,01:31:14.761,"Staties, Boston Police Department, I'm not, uh, sure."
01:31:14.761,01:31:16.638,Jesus Christ.
01:31:18.765,01:31:21.310,Y-you sure it's not the FBI?
01:31:21.310,01:31:25.021,No...
01:31:26.648,01:31:28.817,Ex-wife.
01:31:29.818,01:31:31.569,Old girlfriend?
01:31:33.322,01:31:34.656,They're stupid.
01:31:36.283,01:31:39.911,That is what brings you down in this business.
01:31:39.911,01:31:42.372,"Stupid, huh?"
01:31:42.372,01:31:44.333,"Well, I guess that leaves me out."
01:31:48.544,01:31:51.923,"You know, past days, situation like this, I'd..."
01:31:51.923,01:31:54.176,kill everybody.
01:31:54.176,01:31:57.137,Everybody who works for me.
01:31:57.137,01:31:58.180,Right.
01:31:58.180,01:32:04.811,"You know, Frank, I, uh, I look around at your other guys-- I mean, they're all murderers, right?"
01:32:04.811,01:32:05.937,Right?
01:32:05.937,01:32:09.358,"And I think, could I do murder?"
01:32:11.360,01:32:13.987,And all I can answer myself is...
01:32:16.239,01:32:18.450,what's the difference?
01:32:18.450,01:32:21.953,Give 'em up to the Almighty.
01:32:21.953,01:32:23.663,"You see, that's my point, you know."
01:32:23.663,01:32:25.207,You...
01:32:25.207,01:32:30.128,"You accuse me once, I put up with it."
01:32:30.128,01:32:31.713,You accuse me twice...
01:32:32.881,01:32:34.383,I quit.
01:32:34.383,01:32:35.591,Hmm.
01:32:35.591,01:32:42.140,"You pressure me to fear for my life, and I will put a fucking bullet in your head as if you were anybody else, okay?"
01:32:54.610,01:32:58.156,You got something you want to ask me?
01:32:59.573,01:33:00.742,Look...
01:33:00.742,01:33:02.952,"you're 70 years old, Frank."
01:33:02.952,01:33:04.204,"I'm just saying, okay?"
01:33:04.204,01:33:07.290,One of your guys is gonna pop you.
01:33:07.290,01:33:08.750,One of your guys is gonna pop you.
01:33:08.750,01:33:10.043,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:33:10.043,01:33:11.794,"As for drugs, what the fuck are you doing?"
01:33:11.794,01:33:13.171,What are you doing?
01:33:13.171,01:33:15.006,You don't need the money or the pain in the ass.
01:33:15.006,01:33:16.049,And they will catch you.
01:33:16.049,01:33:22.638,I haven't needed the money since I took Archie's milk money in the third grade.
01:33:22.638,01:33:26.309,"Tell you the truth, I don't need pussy anymore, either."
01:33:27.519,01:33:29.145,But I like it.
01:33:30.688,01:33:32.065,Point I'm making here...
01:33:32.065,01:33:43.201,"is, Bill, I got this rat-- This...gnawing, cheese-eating, fucking rat-- And it brings up questions."
01:33:43.201,01:33:46.788,"You know, say, Bill, like, you're the new guy."
01:33:48.748,01:33:51.126,"Girlfriend, mm-hm."
01:33:52.294,01:33:58.133,"Now, why don't you stay in the bar that night I got your numbers?"
01:33:58.133,01:34:00.843,Social-security numbers.
01:34:00.843,01:34:03.930,Yeah.
01:34:03.930,01:34:09.478,"Is--? Is there something that you just want to go ahead and ask me, 'cause I'll give you the fucking answer, all right?"
01:34:09.478,01:34:10.562,"Frank, look at me."
01:34:10.562,01:34:12.439,Look at me.
01:34:12.439,01:34:15.317,I'm not the fucking rat. Okay?
01:34:15.317,01:34:16.568,I'm not the fucking rat.
01:34:17.527,01:34:20.029,"Start with, you agree there is a rat."
01:34:20.029,01:34:22.656,"You said there is one, all right?"
01:34:22.656,01:34:26.202,I base most of what I do on the idea that you're pretty fucking good at what you do.
01:34:26.202,01:34:28.330,Sure. Sure.
01:34:28.330,01:34:30.832,"You, William..."
01:34:30.832,01:34:32.666,what would you do?
01:34:38.047,01:34:42.302,"Frank, how many of these guys have been with you long enough to be disgruntled, huh?"
01:34:42.302,01:34:43.637,Think about it.
01:34:43.637,01:34:45.972,"You don't pay much, you know."
01:34:45.972,01:34:48.433,It's almost a fucking feudal enterprise.
01:34:48.433,01:34:51.603,The question is-- And this is the only question.
01:34:52.812,01:34:57.484,--who thinks that they can do what you do better than you?
01:34:57.484,01:35:02.447,The only one who could do what I do is me.
01:35:02.447,01:35:06.493,A lot of people had to die for me to be me.
01:35:07.869,01:35:10.372,You want to be me?
01:35:14.376,01:35:16.752,"I probably could be you, yeah."
01:35:16.752,01:35:19.005,"Yeah, I know that much."
01:35:19.922,01:35:23.468,"But I don't want to be you, Frank."
01:35:23.468,01:35:25.761,I don't want to be you.
01:35:25.761,01:35:29.140,Heavy lies the crown...
01:35:30.350,01:35:31.685,sort of thing.
01:35:31.685,01:35:33.645,Yeah.
01:35:33.645,01:35:35.063,FRENCH: Francis.
01:35:35.063,01:35:36.981,I'm out of here.
01:35:35.063,01:35:38.107,"You set the alarm-- COSTELLO: Yeah, all right!"
01:35:38.107,01:35:39.651,I'll see you at Christmas.
01:35:39.651,01:35:40.902,"MAN: All right, good night."
01:35:43.488,01:35:45.407,Know what I like about restaurants?
01:35:45.407,01:35:47.283,The fucking food?
01:35:47.283,01:35:48.577,I don't know. What?
01:35:48.577,01:35:52.247,You learn a lot watching things eat.
01:35:55.083,01:35:57.502,There's a boat coming up Gloucester.
01:35:57.502,01:36:01.297,French will give you all the details.
01:36:01.297,01:36:04.718,"Eat something, for Christ's sake."
01:36:08.846,01:36:13.602,"In the future, I tell ya to do a thing, you fucking do it, you got that?"
01:36:14.810,01:36:16.271,"I got it, okay?"
01:36:19.441,01:36:22.902,"Excuse me, uh, French, I forgot my..."
01:36:22.902,01:36:24.112,"Okay, Francis."
01:36:24.112,01:36:25.321,...cigarette.
01:36:27.990,01:36:30.910,COSTELLO: Eat something.
01:36:39.085,01:36:40.128,Problem?
01:36:40.128,01:36:41.630,"Yeah, I got a problem."
01:36:41.630,01:36:43.839,"I run rat fucks like you, okay? I don't like 'em."
01:36:43.839,01:36:46.551,"The day you wouldn't take a promotion, let me know."
01:36:46.551,01:36:48.595,"If you'd taken care of this, I wouldn't be here."
01:36:48.595,01:36:50.555,"Fuck yourself, you piece of shit."
01:36:50.555,01:36:52.265,I need the names of your undercovers.
01:36:52.265,01:36:53.725,Blow me.
01:36:53.725,01:36:55.101,There's no promotion involved.
01:36:55.101,01:36:57.270,Fucking prick.
01:36:57.270,01:36:58.938,"Hi, captain."
01:36:58.938,01:37:00.690,Look who's here.
01:37:00.690,01:37:01.775,They are not happy with me.
01:37:01.775,01:37:03.109,What do you expect?
01:37:03.109,01:37:06.820,Everybody knows you've been assigned here to find Costello's rat.
01:37:06.820,01:37:10.199,They want to find the leak as much as you do.
01:37:10.199,01:37:14.870,"Like I said, two days ago, my guy damn near found out who Costello's rat is."
01:37:16.331,01:37:17.373,Lost him in the streets.
01:37:17.373,01:37:19.000,Really?
01:37:21.628,01:37:23.338,"Well, did he get a look at the guy?"
01:37:23.338,01:37:25.006,Nah.
01:37:25.006,01:37:26.174,"I mean, nothing? Like..."
01:37:26.174,01:37:27.925,"I mean, anything that could help us?"
01:37:27.925,01:37:29.427,No.
01:37:31.680,01:37:34.599,So you got any advice for me?
01:37:34.599,01:37:41.564,"Costello can't do much business without coordinating with his source, who is here in SIU."
01:37:41.564,01:37:45.443,"Follow Costello, you'll find his rat."
01:37:53.075,01:37:55.328,QUEENAN: You're gonna be looking at my people.
01:37:55.328,01:38:00.041,"Going through their bank statements, their phone calls, their medical records."
01:38:00.041,01:38:04.462,Don't be surprised if they don't buy you a beer or invite you into their homes.
01:38:06.130,01:38:08.466,Let me get you a coffee.
01:38:10.552,01:38:14.597,COLIN: If I wasn't with the Massachusetts State Police...
01:38:14.597,01:38:17.642,If I did it full-time-- Law school.
01:38:18.560,01:38:21.730,--I'd be through it in a year.
01:38:21.730,01:38:23.732,If I wasn't a trooper.
01:38:27.943,01:38:30.739,"But another city, I was thinking that."
01:38:32.240,01:38:33.575,Another city.
01:38:34.283,01:38:35.909,"Another city, huh?"
01:38:35.909,01:38:37.537,Yeah.
01:38:37.537,01:38:40.540,"Yeah, that would be a clean slate."
01:38:41.374,01:38:44.586,"COLIN: I want you to know, you-- You don't got to stay."
01:38:47.296,01:38:51.885,"If we're not gonna make it, it's gotta be you that gets out."
01:38:51.885,01:38:53.428,'Cause I'm not capable.
01:38:55.054,01:38:56.264,I'm fucking Irish.
01:38:56.264,01:39:00.268,I'll deal with something being wrong for the rest of my life.
01:39:07.191,01:39:11.696,"MADOLYN: That might not be a bad idea, you know-- Another city."
01:39:29.255,01:39:30.506,Huh?
01:39:30.506,01:39:31.965,Of course I know how to spot a cop.
01:39:31.965,01:39:33.509,How's that?
01:39:33.509,01:39:36.512,"If he's not paying attention to us, he's a cop."
01:39:36.512,01:39:38.431,"Lookit, you see that guy over there?"
01:39:38.431,01:39:39.933,FITZY: No.
01:39:39.933,01:39:41.058,FITZY: Yeah.
01:39:41.058,01:39:42.976,Not paying attention to us.
01:39:42.976,01:39:44.938,He's a cop.
01:39:44.938,01:39:46.564,FITZY: Okay.
01:39:46.564,01:39:47.690,"You get it now, do you?"
01:39:54.280,01:39:55.406,What about this guy?
01:39:55.406,01:39:56.407,A cop.
01:39:58.534,01:39:59.661,"Hey, how you doing?"
01:39:59.661,01:40:01.036,What kind of dog is that?
01:40:03.498,01:40:05.541,"She ignored us, so she must be a cop."
01:40:05.541,01:40:07.627,She's probably the fucking police commissioner.
01:40:07.627,01:40:09.545,She's probably the fucking...
01:40:19.514,01:40:21.516,You can get out of here.
01:40:21.516,01:40:23.685,"I'm using a new crew tonight, new guys."
01:40:25.520,01:40:26.896,I thought I was on for this.
01:40:26.896,01:40:28.314,"No, I changed my mind."
01:40:28.314,01:40:30.023,Take the night off.
01:40:30.023,01:40:31.609,Francis.
01:40:35.112,01:40:36.280,Jimmy.
01:40:36.280,01:40:38.282,Bring a mop.
01:40:38.282,01:40:41.369,There's guys who answer the questions right and there's guys that don't.
01:40:41.369,01:40:43.371,COSTELLO: And a pail.
01:40:45.331,01:40:47.500,You're a cop.
01:40:47.500,01:40:49.335,What?
01:40:49.335,01:40:50.920,You ignored us.
01:40:52.338,01:40:53.840,We're guessing who cops are.
01:40:53.840,01:40:55.550,"You know, most good-looking women are cops."
01:40:57.719,01:40:59.178,"Well, I'm going home, all right?"
01:40:59.178,01:41:00.889,He's playing with his new guys.
01:41:00.889,01:41:01.931,"See you later, all right?"
01:41:01.931,01:41:03.182,BOTH: See you later.
01:41:09.647,01:41:12.984,"He's moving something with all new guys, a whole new crew."
01:41:12.984,01:41:14.903,"No, no, I can't tell you what or where."
01:41:14.903,01:41:16.153,It's probably disinformation.
01:41:16.153,01:41:17.780,"Just keep following him, all right?"
01:41:17.780,01:41:19.240,"Listen, I need to see you today."
01:41:19.240,01:41:21.325,"Tomorrow, tomorrow."
01:41:21.325,01:41:22.952,You heard nothing about drugs.
01:41:22.952,01:41:24.245,COLIN: No.
01:41:24.245,01:41:25.705,Nothing about new guys?
01:41:25.705,01:41:27.582,Nothing about Gloucester?
01:41:27.582,01:41:28.875,"Not a thing, and I would have."
01:41:28.875,01:41:31.044,That information would have come to me.
01:41:33.254,01:41:34.923,It ain't Bill.
01:41:34.923,01:41:37.090,"No way, he says."
01:41:48.978,01:41:51.773,"Follow Costello, you'll find his rat."
01:41:51.773,01:41:53.399,"Yeah, this is Sergeant Sullivan."
01:41:53.399,01:41:57.612,"I want constant surveillance on Captain Queenan, starting right now."
01:41:58.988,01:42:00.990,Good. Thank you.
01:42:03.534,01:42:05.286,"DETECTIVE 1: Can I ask a question, sarge?"
01:42:05.286,01:42:07.288,Why the fuck are we following Captain Queenan?
01:42:07.288,01:42:09.082,To find out about the good Catholic life?
01:42:09.082,01:42:16.881,"I have to follow every lead, however unlikely, however fucking painful it might be to your delicate fucking sensibility."
01:42:16.881,01:42:18.967,Who told you I had delicate sensibilities?
01:42:18.967,01:42:21.218,"I just don't like it, sarge."
01:42:21.218,01:42:25.640,I have reason to believe that Captain Queenan is Costello's rat.
01:42:25.640,01:42:28.350,So just follow him and don't get made.
01:42:31.312,01:42:33.439,"Sarge, we got the target coming out."
01:43:10.810,01:43:11.894,"Hey, where are you?"
01:43:11.894,01:43:13.688,BILLY: Look down the car.
01:43:15.314,01:43:16.482,You got me?
01:43:16.482,01:43:17.817,"Yeah, I got ya."
01:43:17.817,01:43:20.235,Is there any reason you would have a tail?
01:43:20.235,01:43:21.362,No.
01:43:23.531,01:43:26.534,"'Cause I think-- Billy, I don't have a tail."
01:43:27.785,01:43:29.996,"Get off at the next stop, all right? South Station."
01:43:29.996,01:43:31.413,"You wait there 10 minutes, okay?"
01:43:31.413,01:43:33.875,"South Station, wait 10 minutes."
01:44:09.827,01:44:11.746,He just went into a building down the waterfront.
01:44:11.746,01:44:13.206,344 Wash.
01:44:13.206,01:44:15.833,You got that? 344 Wash.
01:44:19.712,01:44:21.130,He went up to the top floor.
01:44:25.927,01:44:26.886,Building's empty.
01:44:26.886,01:44:28.470,There's no tenants here.
01:44:30.181,01:44:33.142,He's got dope coming in.
01:44:30.181,01:44:35.978,"I don't know where he-- He's getting spooky, captain."
01:44:35.978,01:44:37.312,What you mean?
01:44:37.312,01:44:38.606,He had blood all over his hands.
01:44:38.606,01:44:40.108,He's losing his fucking mind.
01:44:45.988,01:44:48.116,"I don't know what we're doing here, boys."
01:44:49.366,01:44:51.077,He's not including his regular guys.
01:44:51.077,01:44:52.536,But I'm gonna tell you something.
01:44:52.536,01:44:55.706,"Sooner or later, he's gonna find out who I am, and he's gonna fucking kill me."
01:44:55.706,01:44:56.832,I know it.
01:44:56.832,01:44:58.126,He's gonna fucking kill me.
01:45:05.549,01:45:06.884,I think we got him.
01:45:06.884,01:45:08.510,I think Queenan's meeting with him now.
01:45:08.510,01:45:10.387,"All right, all right, listen to me."
01:45:10.387,01:45:11.973,I'm really sorry for your trouble.
01:45:11.973,01:45:13.432,"I swear to God, I am."
01:45:13.432,01:45:14.934,I'll get you out of this.
01:45:14.934,01:45:16.811,"I cannot do it overnight, but I will get you out."
01:45:17.853,01:45:18.980,Yeah?
01:45:18.980,01:45:20.481,"Hey, get the van."
01:45:20.481,01:45:21.857,Heavy work.
01:45:21.857,01:45:24.401,What about the FBI?
01:45:24.401,01:45:26.028,T-they're what?
01:45:29.698,01:45:31.242,Yeah.
01:45:31.242,01:45:33.535,We've been trying to reach you.
01:45:33.535,01:45:34.870,"Listen, we're gonna take him out."
01:45:34.870,01:45:37.999,"Now, lookit, the address is 314 Washington Street."
01:45:37.999,01:45:39.125,You got it?
01:45:39.125,01:45:40.459,"All right, we'll see you there."
01:45:40.459,01:45:42.128,What?
01:45:42.128,01:45:44.046,By who?
01:45:44.046,01:45:45.840,Impossible.
01:45:44.046,01:45:47.008,"No, one of the cops he's got on the inside tipped him."
01:45:47.008,01:45:48.676,"Come on, come on."
01:45:49.384,01:45:50.219,Come on!
01:45:57.059,01:45:59.520,What the fuck is going on?
01:46:00.353,01:46:01.689,DETECTIVE 2: Fucking shit.
01:46:01.689,01:46:03.440,Queenan's meeting with all of 'em.
01:46:04.859,01:46:06.110,Yeah.
01:46:06.110,01:46:07.695,He must be our guy.
01:46:07.695,01:46:09.362,DETECTIVE 1: You gotta get him outta here.
01:46:09.362,01:46:13.909,These guys are-- THUG 1: Up on the roof!
01:46:13.909,01:46:15.661,"THUG 2: Come on, he's up on the roof."
01:46:15.661,01:46:17.330,"QUEENAN: Ah, Christ, it's too late."
01:46:17.330,01:46:18.789,Let's go back up.
01:46:22.251,01:46:24.128,BILLY: Shit.
01:46:24.128,01:46:25.213,Take the fire escape.
01:46:25.213,01:46:26.547,What about you?
01:46:25.213,01:46:27.965,"I'll be fine, but I can't protect you."
01:46:27.965,01:46:29.382,Now go! Go!
01:46:47.735,01:46:49.945,One of you mugs got a light?
01:46:49.945,01:46:53.115,He's studying law at Notre Dame.
01:46:53.115,01:46:55.243,Hey!
01:46:53.115,01:46:57.578,"Goddamn, motherfucker, now, where's your fucking boy?!"
01:47:13.552,01:47:15.388,What the fuck was that?
01:47:15.388,01:47:17.056,What--?
01:47:21.060,01:47:22.728,Something came off the building.
01:47:23.854,01:47:25.731,What the fuck?
01:47:28.776,01:47:30.278,"Oh, fuck."
01:47:30.278,01:47:31.695,Something came off the building?
01:47:31.695,01:47:33.697,Go again with that.
01:47:33.697,01:47:35.324,I don't know what it was.
01:47:42.248,01:47:43.582,Fuck!
01:47:43.582,01:47:45.458,Can't get a visual.
01:47:45.458,01:47:48.087,We gotta get on foot if you want me to get up on this thing.
01:47:49.171,01:47:50.756,Where were you?
01:47:50.756,01:47:52.716,You're fucking late!
01:47:52.716,01:47:54.343,Something came off the roof?
01:47:54.343,01:47:56.429,I came to meet you!
01:47:56.429,01:47:58.639,What the fuck--?
01:47:58.639,01:47:59.974,I got four armed men out front.
01:47:59.974,01:48:01.600,You want us to pursue?
01:48:01.600,01:48:03.144,Stay in the car.
01:48:03.144,01:48:05.562,Fuck. No fucking pursuit!
01:48:05.562,01:48:07.022,What came off the roof?
01:48:07.022,01:48:08.399,No pursuit.
01:48:08.399,01:48:09.566,Fuck this.
01:48:10.776,01:48:11.944,Jeez!
01:48:16.282,01:48:17.866,Come on. Agh!
01:48:18.617,01:48:20.369,FITZY: Richard! Get in the van!
01:48:21.536,01:48:23.831,Get in the fucking van!
01:48:23.831,01:48:24.957,Move it!
01:48:24.957,01:48:26.917,"All right, I'm in!"
01:48:32.505,01:48:34.049,DETECTIVE 2: 32X to CP!
01:48:34.049,01:48:35.217,We're being fired upon!
01:48:35.217,01:48:36.469,An officer is down!
01:48:36.469,01:48:38.012,"I repeat, an officer is down!"
01:48:38.012,01:48:40.181,Trooper's been shot!
01:48:58.199,01:49:01.452,So do you know why Queenan went into that building?
01:49:01.452,01:49:03.454,No.
01:49:01.452,01:49:05.414,DIGNAM: A better question is why the fuck were your guys following him?
01:49:05.414,01:49:08.792,COLIN: I told Internal Investigations to follow Captain Queenan.
01:49:08.792,01:49:10.543,Internal Investigations' business.
01:49:12.129,01:49:13.839,Fucking piece of shit!
01:49:13.839,01:49:15.548,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
01:49:15.548,01:49:17.510,Fucking bitch!
01:49:17.510,01:49:19.303,Fuck off of me!
01:49:17.510,01:49:20.762,I don't have to explain anything to anybody!
01:49:20.762,01:49:22.764,I can fucking investigate anybody I fucking want to!
01:49:22.764,01:49:25.184,Let him go! Come on!
01:49:25.184,01:49:28.770,I got reason to believe that Queenan got killed by his own fucking undercover.
01:49:28.770,01:49:30.105,That's a fucking lie.
01:49:30.105,01:49:33.775,"He has fucking information in a locked file, as did Captain Queenan."
01:49:33.775,01:49:35.444,I need access to those files.
01:49:35.444,01:49:39.614,"Forgot the password, but if you come to the garage, I'll be happy to give it to you."
01:49:39.614,01:49:41.033,Nobody calls me a liar!
01:49:41.033,01:49:42.410,Shut up!
01:49:42.410,01:49:44.161,Work with the tech guys to unlock those files.
01:49:44.161,01:49:46.205,Take a leave of absence.
01:49:47.081,01:49:48.916,Queenan is dead.
01:49:48.916,01:49:50.501,I'm your boss now.
01:49:50.501,01:49:52.002,I'd rather hand in my papers first.
01:49:52.002,01:49:54.587,World needs plenty of bartenders.
01:49:54.587,01:49:56.257,Two weeks with pay.
01:49:56.257,01:49:57.508,Good.
01:49:59.385,01:50:01.470,Piece of shit.
01:50:03.097,01:50:05.099,I need those codes.
01:50:05.099,01:50:07.518,You want those codes.
01:50:10.354,01:50:12.231,So where the fuck were you?
01:50:13.732,01:50:16.402,"Well, boss told me to go home."
01:50:16.402,01:50:18.279,Whatever.
01:50:18.279,01:50:20.822,But you were not fucking home.
01:50:20.822,01:50:22.408,So where the fuck were you?
01:50:22.408,01:50:25.786,"I was at the grocery store with no signal, all right?"
01:50:25.786,01:50:28.372,"When I got the signal, I got the call."
01:50:28.372,01:50:29.706,What the fuck do you want from me?
01:50:29.706,01:50:31.333,"Was I there or was I not there, huh?"
01:50:31.333,01:50:32.667,DELAHUNT: Billy.
01:50:32.667,01:50:35.796,Billy.
01:50:39.300,01:50:40.384,Yeah.
01:50:40.384,01:50:41.760,Come here. Come here.
01:50:43.596,01:50:44.888,Yeah?
01:50:45.973,01:50:48.392,You know what I thought today?
01:50:48.392,01:50:50.144,Huh?
01:50:50.144,01:50:51.186,What's that?
01:50:51.186,01:50:55.316,Who didn't show up today...
01:50:55.316,01:50:56.358,is a rat.
01:50:59.528,01:51:00.695,Yeah?
01:51:02.114,01:51:03.282,So?
01:51:03.282,01:51:06.494,You never been late in your life.
01:51:06.494,01:51:07.536,And...
01:51:07.536,01:51:09.163,when I called you...
01:51:09.163,01:51:10.164,Hm?
01:51:10.164,01:51:11.664,I-- I made a mistake.
01:51:11.664,01:51:22.217,"I-- I gave you the wrong address, but...you showed up at the right one, didn't ya?"
01:51:23.885,01:51:27.515,"Tell me why I didn't tell nobody, huh? Huh?"
01:51:27.515,01:51:29.433,Tell me why.
01:51:52.080,01:51:53.457,That cop was tough.
01:51:53.457,01:51:55.250,We were excessive with the cop.
01:51:55.250,01:51:56.251,He's dead.
01:51:57.628,01:51:59.921,I'm going home.
01:51:57.628,01:52:02.299,COLIN: Your guys should not have done that.
01:52:02.299,01:52:04.468,"With me, it tends to be the other guy."
01:52:04.468,01:52:06.136,"Yeah, but Queenan."
01:52:06.136,01:52:07.846,You killed the guy who had all the info.
01:52:07.846,01:52:09.431,Now Dignam's gone.
01:52:09.431,01:52:12.267,He resigned.
01:52:12.267,01:52:13.935,"Yeah, he put in his papers, Frank."
01:52:13.935,01:52:15.437,He left.
01:52:15.437,01:52:18.232,"Don't get your balls in an uproar, Collie."
01:52:18.232,01:52:23.654,"That Irish pissant, he's so hot for me, we give him a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it."
01:52:23.654,01:52:25.738,Let's give him a whiff.
01:52:25.738,01:52:26.739,I will.
01:52:26.739,01:52:28.200,Don't worry.
01:52:28.200,01:52:29.910,I'll take care of it.
01:52:30.994,01:52:33.163,COSTELLO: Sweetheart.
01:52:33.163,01:52:35.499,You're giving me a hard-on.
01:52:35.499,01:52:37.501,Are you sure it's me?
01:52:37.501,01:52:41.213,Not all that talk about whiffing and crawling up asses?
01:52:41.213,01:52:43.716,Watch your fucking mouth.
01:52:43.716,01:52:46.385,You watch it.
01:52:46.385,01:52:49.388,Let me straighten you out.
01:52:57.229,01:52:59.231,I tried to call you a few times.
01:53:02.651,01:53:04.612,"Yeah, I-- I know."
01:53:31.430,01:53:35.142,"Listen, I-- I can't be a friend to you."
01:53:40.272,01:53:42.399,I'm sorry.
01:53:48.821,01:53:49.906,Yeah.
01:53:49.906,01:53:52.367,"Ahem, yeah."
01:53:54.161,01:53:56.664,I know.
01:56:05.292,01:56:06.501,Yeah.
01:56:07.586,01:56:11.339,You called this number on a dead guy's phone.
01:56:11.339,01:56:13.091,Who are you?
01:56:13.091,01:56:15.260,So it is you.
01:56:16.637,01:56:18.388,Thank God you're all right.
01:56:18.388,01:56:19.807,We were very worried.
01:56:20.808,01:56:22.768,Who are you?
01:56:23.435,01:56:25.562,This is Sergeant Sullivan.
01:56:25.562,01:56:27.606,I'm taking over Queenan's unit.
01:56:27.606,01:56:30.233,Let me talk to Dignam to confirm it.
01:56:30.233,01:56:32.986,Staff Sergeant Dignam is on a leave of absence.
01:56:32.986,01:56:35.029,He's very upset.
01:56:35.029,01:56:37.991,We're all very upset.
01:56:35.029,01:56:40.911,I mean-- I think the best thing would be f-for you to come in.
01:56:40.911,01:56:43.789,We-- We need you to come in.
01:56:46.500,01:57:35.173,"Or meet me-- Police have confirmed that the body of the man found dead in the Fenway Marshes yesterday afternoon is that of Timothy Delahunt, an undercover policeman for the city of Boston."
01:57:35.173,01:57:39.803,This was the scene yesterday when Delahunt's body was found in the marshes near the Fenway.
01:57:39.803,01:57:43.807,"As for who did this or why, that's something police are working on right now."
01:57:43.807,01:57:46.100,I don't believe it.
01:57:46.810,01:57:47.978,What can't you believe?
01:57:47.978,01:57:51.356,"I spent all fucking night dragging the poor bastard, didn't I?"
01:57:51.356,01:57:53.692,"Tell me, how'd they find him so fast?"
01:57:53.692,01:57:56.528,Somebody walking a fucking dog in 3 feet of mud?
01:57:56.528,01:57:58.739,What kind of fucking size of dog is that?
01:57:58.739,01:58:01.157,"Must've been a big fucking dog, man."
01:58:01.157,01:58:03.577,"I spent all fucking night doing it, man."
01:58:03.577,01:58:05.203,I'm embarrassed.
01:58:05.203,01:58:07.581,I still don't believe he was a cop.
01:58:07.581,01:58:08.749,I don't believe it.
01:58:08.749,01:58:12.252,The cops are saying he's a cop...
01:58:13.503,01:58:15.964,so I won't look for the cop.
01:58:17.215,01:58:18.633,"Are you soft, Fitz?"
01:58:18.633,01:58:33.690,"When I tell you to dump a body in the marsh, you dump him in the marsh, not where some guy from John Hancock goes every Thursday to get a fucking blowjob!"
01:58:34.190,01:58:35.358,Don't laugh!
01:58:37.193,01:58:40.363,This ain't reality TV!
01:58:43.909,01:58:45.201,Proceed.
01:59:08.141,01:59:09.101,What?
01:59:09.101,01:59:11.144,"Yeah, uh, you got a tail."
01:59:11.144,01:59:12.437,"Two cars, not very subtle."
01:59:12.437,01:59:14.022,They're not gonna be subtle from now on.
01:59:14.022,01:59:15.941,That's what I've been trying to tell you.
01:59:15.941,01:59:17.859,So get rid of them.
01:59:17.859,01:59:21.154,"There's no need for you to go yourself, Frank."
01:59:21.154,01:59:23.698,Get rid of the fucking tail!
01:59:27.953,01:59:29.121,All right.
01:59:36.169,01:59:37.921,Fucking rats.
01:59:37.921,01:59:39.255,It's wearing me thin.
01:59:39.255,01:59:42.717,"Francis, it's a nation of fucking rats."
01:59:58.650,02:00:00.152,Stop. Stop.
02:00:00.152,02:00:01.862,Pull them off Costello.
02:00:01.862,02:00:03.613,What the fuck are you talking about?
02:00:03.613,02:00:06.074,I got it from an undercover.
02:00:06.074,02:00:07.450,So let's let the UC take him in.
02:00:07.450,02:00:09.036,What undercover?
02:00:09.036,02:00:11.579,He called me when he found out Queenan was dead.
02:00:11.579,02:00:13.165,You give him to me.
02:00:13.165,02:00:15.042,I can give you Costello's destination.
02:00:15.042,02:00:17.293,You know where he's going?
02:00:17.293,02:00:19.629,So get rid of the tail.
02:00:19.629,02:00:21.006,We'll take this prick tonight.
02:00:21.006,02:00:22.674,"All right, let's go now."
02:00:22.674,02:00:23.758,"All units, fall back."
02:00:23.758,02:00:25.426,"All units, fall back."
02:00:45.989,02:00:48.408,"All right, it's the warehouse he owns over on Sheffield."
02:00:48.408,02:00:51.119,"He's gotta have a container or a truck there. Go, go, go."
02:01:15.060,02:01:16.186,Load it.
02:01:24.569,02:01:27.155,"Frank, how do you know you don't have a tail, huh?"
02:01:28.115,02:01:30.283,Were you not in the fucking car?
02:01:28.115,02:01:32.493,"Yeah, what if they took one off and put another on?"
02:01:36.164,02:01:37.331,Load!
02:01:44.631,02:01:45.799,Okay.
02:01:45.799,02:01:47.134,"Go, go."
02:01:49.510,02:01:52.222,"COSTELLO: Come on, what are you waiting for?!"
02:01:53.514,02:01:55.475,"Frank wants me to check the back, all right?"
02:01:55.475,02:01:57.060,You go ahead.
02:01:57.060,02:01:58.436,COSTELLO: Move out!
02:02:08.696,02:02:09.864,Cocksuckers.
02:02:16.997,02:02:18.832,Motherfuckers!
02:02:23.170,02:02:24.671,Motherfuckers!
02:02:28.258,02:02:29.383,Back the fuck up!
02:02:30.885,02:02:32.262,Fucking shot me.
02:02:41.188,02:02:43.106,"Come on, fucking bastard!"
02:03:00.748,02:03:02.625,Fuck it.
02:03:41.956,02:03:45.001,How the fuck did this happen?
02:03:47.003,02:03:49.881,You're an FBI informant?
02:03:49.881,02:03:52.133,Are you fucking kidding me?
02:03:53.176,02:03:54.344,Grow up.
02:03:55.762,02:03:58.890,Of course I talk to the FBI.
02:03:58.890,02:04:00.641,Do they know who I am?
02:04:00.641,02:04:07.023,I-- I never gave up anybody who wasn't going down anyway.
02:04:07.732,02:04:09.609,Nobody knows nothing.
02:04:11.778,02:04:12.946,Frank.
02:04:13.529,02:04:15.949,Frank. Frank.
02:04:16.574,02:04:17.992,Do they know about me?
02:04:20.494,02:04:23.206,"I know about you, Collie."
02:04:23.206,02:04:25.375,You know I'd never give you up.
02:04:26.626,02:04:29.129,"You're like a-- What, like a son?"
02:04:30.338,02:04:31.672,To you?
02:04:31.672,02:04:34.008,Is that what this is about?
02:04:34.675,02:04:39.306,All that murdering and fucking and no sons.
02:05:01.077,02:05:03.246,Fucking rat prick!
02:05:25.226,02:05:26.853,GWEN: Frank?
02:05:26.853,02:05:28.021,Yeah?
02:05:30.190,02:05:31.565,Who's this?
02:05:33.234,02:05:34.986,Gwen?
02:05:34.986,02:05:36.946,Where the hell's Frank?
02:05:39.282,02:05:41.284,Frank got shot.
02:05:43.495,02:05:45.830,"Gwen, we lost Frank."
02:05:54.588,02:05:56.383,I got him!
02:05:56.383,02:05:58.885,I got Costello here!
02:06:03.097,02:06:05.058,"MAN: Hey, good job, sarge."
02:06:05.975,02:06:07.268,"No, it's..."
02:06:09.270,02:06:10.397,For you.
02:06:11.689,02:06:13.400,Thank you.
02:06:13.400,02:06:15.193,Thank you.
02:06:18.363,02:06:20.907,He's been waiting here a long time for you.
02:06:21.908,02:06:23.743,How'd you get him without the files?
02:06:24.494,02:06:26.579,Caller ID. Queenan's phone.
02:06:26.579,02:06:28.415,Hm.
02:06:28.415,02:06:30.333,You know that guy?
02:06:30.333,02:06:32.919,We were classmates in the academy together.
02:06:34.795,02:06:36.047,Yeah.
02:06:40.134,02:06:41.761,"Good to see you, trooper."
02:06:41.761,02:06:43.179,Yeah. Ahem.
02:06:43.179,02:06:44.847,Colin Sullivan.
02:06:44.847,02:06:46.599,Yeah.
02:06:47.767,02:06:49.727,"Now, how long were you undercover?"
02:06:49.727,02:06:51.812,Long time.
02:06:51.812,02:06:53.731,Long fucking time.
02:06:53.731,02:06:58.861,"Well, I can't even tell you the debt..."
02:07:01.406,02:07:04.784,I just want you to know I'll be recommending you for the Medal of Merit.
02:07:04.784,02:07:07.036,"Oh, yeah?"
02:07:08.204,02:07:10.664,"It's kind of like a gold star around here, huh?"
02:07:12.459,02:07:14.961,It's the highest honor we got.
02:07:14.961,02:07:17.505,"Look, I just want my identity back, all right?"
02:07:17.505,02:07:19.424,That's all.
02:07:19.424,02:07:21.175,I understand.
02:07:21.175,02:07:22.718,"No, no."
02:07:22.718,02:07:26.306,Being a cop's not an identity.
02:07:26.306,02:07:27.807,Check your computer.
02:07:27.807,02:07:29.559,You'll have to excuse my behavior.
02:07:29.559,02:07:33.854,My only contact in the last six months has been a police shrink.
02:07:36.316,02:07:38.651,How's that working for you?
02:07:38.651,02:07:39.819,Is it helpful?
02:07:41.237,02:07:44.157,What are you gonna do about Costello's rat in this building?
02:07:46.534,02:07:48.328,I'm gonna find the prick.
02:07:48.328,02:07:49.912,Yeah.
02:07:49.912,02:07:53.040,"I'm gonna find him, and I'm gonna arrest him."
02:07:53.040,02:07:54.459,Good.
02:07:54.459,02:07:56.419,And if there's anything you can do to help me...
02:07:56.419,02:08:02.425,"You know, I mean, did Frank ever mention a-- A name, or, you know, anything?"
02:08:02.425,02:08:05.052,Anything you can give me?
02:08:05.845,02:08:08.640,"I just want my money, and I wanna go home."
02:08:08.640,02:08:10.808,"That'd be the best thing, I think, for everybody."
02:08:10.808,02:08:12.352,Fair enough.
02:08:12.352,02:08:17.565,"I just, I ca-- Can't get into your file unless I have your password."
02:08:19.442,02:08:20.818,It's my name.
02:08:21.902,02:08:24.030,William Costigan Jr.
02:08:24.030,02:08:27.241,They gave it to me in case I had to explain myself to someone like you.
02:08:27.241,02:08:29.994,It's your name.
02:08:31.912,02:08:33.414,All right. Uh...
02:08:33.414,02:08:36.209,"Fucking unreal. That's-- Well, it makes a lot of sense."
02:08:36.209,02:08:38.670,"Listen, Bill, I got to run this in the other room."
02:08:38.670,02:08:40.921,This computer's getting all frigging blooey on me.
02:08:40.921,02:08:43.841,Give me two minutes. I'll have you out of here in no time.
02:10:17.893,02:10:21.814,"All right, everything checks out, so let's get you paid."
02:10:52.637,02:10:53.805,I know.
02:10:55.848,02:10:58.810,"I know. I'm not-- I'm not here for that, okay?"
02:10:58.810,02:11:00.478,I'm not.
02:11:02.689,02:11:06.400,"Listen, I've got to give you something."
02:11:06.400,02:11:08.986,Something I need you to keep.
02:11:08.986,02:11:10.237,For me.
02:11:12.699,02:11:14.200,Okay?
02:11:17.495,02:11:18.705,What is it?
02:11:18.705,02:11:22.333,This is for you to hold.
02:11:22.333,02:11:26.420,You open this if something happens to me or if I call you and I tell you to open it.
02:11:26.420,02:11:29.298,"You're the only person I can trust, all right?"
02:11:30.758,02:11:31.884,Please.
02:11:35.888,02:11:36.930,All right.
02:11:36.930,02:11:40.934,"Look, I'm-- I'm sorry to even-- I'm sorry to even show up here like this, you know."
02:11:40.934,02:11:43.813,I-- There's just no one else I could give it to.
02:11:45.732,02:11:47.650,There's no one else.
02:11:48.776,02:11:50.944,I'm really sorry.
02:11:50.944,02:11:53.197,"Well, you know, I have, um..."
02:11:54.281,02:11:55.533,I...
02:11:55.533,02:11:59.245,"Whatever you have to say, think about it real hard, all right?"
02:11:59.245,02:12:02.415,"If you still want to tell me, you tell me in two weeks, okay?"
02:12:32.612,02:12:34.697,I was dreaming I was dead.
02:12:34.697,02:12:37.157,Oh. Death is hard.
02:12:37.700,02:12:39.869,Life is much easier.
02:12:41.161,02:12:42.162,What's this?
02:12:42.162,02:12:43.997,Open it.
02:12:52.924,02:12:54.049,Really?
02:12:54.049,02:12:55.927,Yeah.
02:12:55.927,02:12:57.553,Really?
02:12:57.553,02:13:00.640,Yeah.
02:13:00.640,02:13:06.228,And they-- They say that this little speck is a penis.
02:13:08.355,02:13:10.316,Wow.
02:13:10.316,02:13:11.651,It's a boy.
02:13:11.651,02:13:14.987,"Mm, yeah, well, one usually follows the other."
02:13:16.155,02:13:18.240,"Can you still, uh...?"
02:14:08.499,02:14:19.010,"COSTELLO: I hope I won't have to remind you that if you don't find this cheese-eating rat bastard in your department, you can assume it won't be me who pays for it."
02:14:19.010,02:14:22.221,"COLIN: Now, why would you have to remind me of that?"
02:14:22.221,02:14:27.643,Would I--? Would I be any good at what I do if I didn't fucking already know that?
02:14:27.643,02:14:30.897,"Frank, you got to trust me."
02:14:30.897,02:14:33.399,"You just got to let me do it my way, Frank."
02:14:33.399,02:14:37.110,Just let me do it.
02:14:37.110,02:14:41.198,"Hey, it fucking involves lying and I'm pretty fucking good at that, right?"
02:14:44.660,02:14:45.953,What?
02:14:49.707,02:14:50.875,What?
02:14:53.419,02:14:54.879,COSTELLO: We got a cop in my crew.
02:14:54.879,02:14:56.296,"COLIN: Yeah, I know."
02:14:56.296,02:14:58.257,I'm kind of getting that feeling too.
02:14:58.257,02:15:00.968,COSTELLO: He's one of yours. Inside.
02:15:00.968,02:15:03.971,COLIN: Frank. I got no access to Queenan's undercover files.
02:15:03.971,02:15:06.473,He and Dignam run the snitches.
02:15:03.971,02:15:09.602,"I'm doing my-- You know what, I thought I was the liar."
02:15:10.436,02:15:13.146,"Hey, I can explain that!"
02:15:18.903,02:15:20.529,Costello recorded everything.
02:15:20.529,02:15:23.616,He put all the tapes in a little box and kept them with his lawyer.
02:15:23.616,02:15:25.826,That was his insurance.
02:15:25.826,02:15:26.994,His lawyer came to me.
02:15:26.994,02:15:28.662,"Imagine that, you rat fuck."
02:15:28.662,02:15:31.082,Costello trusted me more than anyone.
02:15:31.082,02:15:33.709,Sound quality good enough?
02:15:35.044,02:15:36.211,What do you want?
02:15:36.211,02:15:39.381,"I told you, I want my identity back, you two-faced faggot."
02:15:40.340,02:15:41.508,"Look, where are you?"
02:15:41.508,02:15:44.386,Three o'clock.
02:15:44.386,02:15:46.555,You keep your cell on.
02:15:58.525,02:15:59.986,Open the door.
02:16:04.156,02:16:07.785,Open-- Didn't we already talk about this?
02:16:09.453,02:16:11.122,This is my job.
02:16:36.229,02:16:37.523,Freeze!
02:16:37.523,02:16:39.358,Hey! Hey! Hey!
02:16:39.358,02:16:41.986,Put the fucking gun down!
02:16:41.986,02:16:43.570,I came here to talk some sense into you.
02:16:43.570,02:16:45.739,Hands!
02:16:45.739,02:16:48.034,I can get you your money.
02:16:48.034,02:16:49.118,I can get you your money.
02:16:49.118,02:16:50.410,Oh! Ah!
02:16:50.410,02:16:51.745,You didn't come here to talk.
02:16:51.745,02:16:53.330,You came here to get arrested.
02:16:53.330,02:16:54.832,You got fucking tapes of what?
02:16:54.832,02:16:56.542,Costello was my informant!
02:16:56.542,02:16:58.460,I was a rat?
02:16:58.460,02:17:00.462,He was working for me.
02:17:00.462,02:17:02.798,Shut your fucking mouth.
02:17:02.798,02:17:05.384,"Wha--? What is this? A citizen's arrest? Blow me, all right?"
02:17:05.384,02:17:07.053,"Only one of us is a cop here, Bill."
02:17:07.053,02:17:09.262,"You understand that, Bill?"
02:17:09.262,02:17:11.098,Would you shut the fuck up?
02:17:09.262,02:17:13.517,I'm a sergeant in the Massachusetts State Police. Who the fuck are you?
02:17:13.517,02:17:14.810,I erased you!
02:17:15.602,02:17:17.396,"You erased me, huh?"
02:17:17.396,02:17:20.191,"Oh, yeah, go ahead, shoot a cop, Einstein. Watch what happens."
02:17:20.191,02:17:22.568,This bullet would go right through your fucking head.
02:17:22.568,02:17:24.319,Watch what happens!
02:17:24.319,02:17:27.322,"What, so you can get the parade, huh? The bagpipes and bullshit?"
02:17:27.322,02:17:30.076,"Fuck you! Fuck you, I'm fucking arresting you!"
02:17:30.076,02:17:31.535,Stupidest thing you could do.
02:17:31.535,02:17:33.162,Shut the fuck up!
02:17:35.706,02:17:38.000,I could give a fuck if the charges don't stick.
02:17:38.000,02:17:40.920,I'm still fucking arresting you.
02:17:43.005,02:17:46.341,Drop your weapon and step away from Sergeant Sullivan!
02:17:46.341,02:17:48.385,I called you.

02:17:59.939,02:18:02.233,Drop your weapon to the floor and we'll discuss it.
02:18:02.233,02:18:04.443,"Look, he's Costello's rat, all right?"
02:18:04.443,02:18:08.572,I got boxes of tapes. Evidence.
02:18:11.700,02:18:13.577,Maybe you do.
02:18:13.577,02:18:15.829,But right now I need you to drop the weapon.
02:18:15.829,02:18:18.916,"I have evidence cold-linking this prick to Costello, right?"
02:18:18.916,02:18:20.876,COLIN: Would you shoot this fucking prick?
02:18:20.876,02:18:22.128,You know who I am.
02:18:22.128,02:18:24.213,You know who I am.
02:18:22.128,02:18:26.882,I'm taking him down-- I'm taking him downstairs now.
02:18:29.927,02:18:31.845,You know who I am.
02:18:56.620,02:18:58.330,Shut up.
02:18:59.748,02:19:04.461,"I can't wait to see you explain this to a fucking Suffolk County jury, you fucking cocksucker."
02:19:04.461,02:19:06.297,This is gonna be fucking fun.
02:19:18.142,02:19:20.019,Just fucking kill me.
02:19:22.021,02:19:23.730,Just fucking kill me.
02:19:26.483,02:19:27.901,I am killing you.
02:20:04.730,02:20:07.482,Did you think you were the only one he had on the inside?
02:20:07.482,02:20:10.027,Costello was gonna sell us to the FBI.
02:20:10.027,02:20:11.778,"It's you and me now, you understand?"
02:20:11.778,02:20:14.281,"We gotta take care of each other, you understand?"
02:20:28.628,02:20:29.922,Give me that.

02:21:06.208,02:21:14.300,"Uh, at that time I immediately checked the vitals on both Troopers Brown and Costigan and discovered that-- That they had expired."
02:21:17.928,02:21:19.846,I just want to go on record.
02:21:20.722,02:21:24.684,I'm recommending William Costigan for the Medal of Merit.
02:21:35.612,02:21:37.364,"Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord."
