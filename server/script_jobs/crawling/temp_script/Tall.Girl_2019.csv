00:21:18.944,00:21:19.820,Let's go!
00:35:07.522,00:35:08.481,Fantastic.
00:41:22.146,00:41:25.566,Who's at the door?
00:41:25.649,00:41:26.609,Not now!
00:42:08.776,00:42:12.488,That was painful.
00:42:12.613,00:42:15.241,Who asked you?
00:53:42.052,00:53:43.803,She should watch hers.
01:00:30.752,01:00:31.711,Bye.
00:00:48.298,00:00:50.050,"What's the big deal with this book, anyway?"
00:00:51.301,00:00:55.180,"It's apparently all deep, but I have no idea what it's supposed to be about."
00:00:55.722,00:00:57.724,It's... It's about alienation.
00:00:58.558,00:01:00.894,An alien nation? What? What chapter is that in?
00:01:03.646,00:01:09.444,It's about Ignatius trying to find acceptance in a world that wants nothing to do with him.
00:01:09.986,00:01:13.531,"Well, maybe he would find acceptance if he wasn't such a know-it-all?"
00:01:13.907,00:01:24.417,"I think his showing off his intelligence is just a way of protecting himself, which is kind of tragic because the alienation is the source of his strength, but then-- But it's also the source of his problems."
00:01:29.756,00:01:32.300,"Um, I should probably go."
00:01:33.426,00:01:34.761,"Hey, look, you know..."
00:01:36.179,00:01:38.723,"I know I've only known you for, like, two minutes, but..."
00:01:40.058,00:01:42.018,would you maybe wanna...
00:01:53.780,00:01:55.281,Never... Never mind.
00:02:01.788,00:02:03.289,that you go to school with?
00:02:03.373,00:02:07.460,"The one that people call LeBron, Skyscraper, Daddy Long Legs?"
00:02:07.961,00:02:09.295,"Well, that's me."
00:02:09.379,00:02:11.756,"Sixteen years old, six foot one."
00:02:12.382,00:02:13.466,And a half.
00:02:14.467,00:02:17.679,"Growing up, my height was of immense concern to my father."
00:02:17.762,00:02:20.640,"Dr. Seeger, our daughter is three years old."
00:02:20.723,00:02:22.058,She just reached four feet.
00:02:22.725,00:02:23.893,It's not stopping.
00:02:23.977,00:02:25.520,Can't we give her hormones?
00:02:25.603,00:02:30.358,I read that diethylstilbestrol is very effective in stunting a child's growth.
00:02:30.608,00:02:33.945,"Honey, I don't think it's good to take anything with that many consonants."
00:02:34.028,00:02:38.449,"In some girls, diethylstilbestrol has successfully stunted growth."
00:02:38.533,00:02:41.161,"You know, in others, it's caused a host of health problems."
00:02:42.370,00:02:43.621,Infertility being one of them.
00:02:46.457,00:02:51.963,"Honey, this may be too soon to talk about, but do you even want kids?"
00:02:57.177,00:02:59.637,I continued to grow at a rapid pace.
00:02:59.721,00:03:00.972,And guess what?
00:03:01.055,00:03:06.436,"Having back row, center placement in all of your class photos isn't exactly a self-esteem booster."
00:03:07.520,00:03:12.192,Now I'm just trying to get through the day with as few people as possible asking me...
00:03:12.275,00:03:13.943,"Well, how's the weather up there?"
00:03:15.195,00:03:17.197,You think your life is hard?
00:03:17.280,00:03:19.866,I'm a high school junior wearing size 13 Nikes.
00:03:20.700,00:03:22.827,Men's size 13 Nikes.
00:03:22.911,00:03:23.912,Beat that.
00:03:45.433,00:03:47.977,"Fareeda, how much longer do I have to endure this?"
00:03:48.061,00:03:50.146,Just trying to start my next class off on a high note.
00:03:50.230,00:03:52.523,"Well, I start every class off on a high note."
00:03:52.607,00:03:55.109,Wow. Mocking yourself right out of the gate.
00:03:55.193,00:03:57.570,Usually the self-deprecation doesn't start until lunch.
00:03:57.904,00:04:00.657,"-How's the weather up there? -Hey, what'd you say to my best friend?"
00:04:00.949,00:04:03.243,"-Fareeda, please. -Quick, you think you got jokes?"
00:04:03.326,00:04:05.912,Say some more funny stuff. Dazzle us.
00:04:06.287,00:04:07.997,"-I'm sorry, okay? -No."
00:04:08.331,00:04:10.375,"No, you're not. See, I'm sorry."
00:04:10.458,00:04:21.719,"I'm sorry I'm such good friends with the girl who constantly gets asked that idiotic question ten times a day, because every time she hears it, it chips away another little piece of her soul, which, in turn, chips away another little piece of my soul."
00:04:21.803,00:04:23.429,"So, thank you, soul chipper."
00:04:23.721,00:04:25.723,"In fact, that's your new nickname."
00:04:26.182,00:04:27.100,Soul Chipper.
00:04:29.394,00:04:31.437,"Honestly, what would you do without me?"
00:04:31.521,00:04:33.147,I shudder to think.
00:04:33.231,00:04:35.566,"Well, stand up straight. Walk tall."
00:04:35.650,00:04:36.818,No slouching!
00:04:44.492,00:04:45.868,How's the weather up there?
00:04:46.411,00:04:48.079,And we're back.
00:05:01.092,00:05:03.928,who's been winning beauty pageants since she was six.
00:05:04.345,00:05:09.892,"She was spared the tall gene, ...in the genetic universe."
00:05:10.768,00:05:12.770,She got Grandpa Larry's allergies.
00:05:20.111,00:05:21.237,Let me see it with the wave.
00:05:23.948,00:05:24.907,I don't know.
00:05:25.575,00:05:31.998,"I feel like the competition has got a lot more fierce since I was a contestant, so I think you need to step it up."
00:05:44.177,00:05:45.136,How's it goin'?
00:05:47.180,00:05:48.139,Fine.
00:05:48.598,00:05:49.849,You feeling okay?
00:05:51.351,00:06:05.740,"Like, no headaches, irregular heartbeats or unexplainable-- Dad, I-- I know that you live with this constant fear that I'm just gonna keep growing and growing until all of my vital organs explode, but really, if I was gonna have major health problems, I think I would have had them by now."
00:06:05.823,00:06:09.994,"No, Yao Defen's osteoporosis didn't show up till she was in college."
00:06:10.078,00:06:15.333,"She holds the record for the world's tallest woman. She died 2012, age 40."
00:06:15.416,00:06:17.752,"-So tragic. -Okay, and why do you know that?"
00:06:17.835,00:06:19.545,And why would you bring it up at dinner?
00:06:19.629,00:06:20.963,I'm just making conversation.
00:06:21.047,00:06:23.049,About tall people dying young?
00:06:23.132,00:06:25.134,"Yeah, well, I gotta say something."
00:06:25.426,00:06:28.638,She hardly talks to us anymore. You just keep to yourself.
00:06:29.472,00:06:32.934,I can't remember the last time that you sat down at the piano.
00:06:33.017,00:06:34.727,Why don't you play anymore?
00:06:36.354,00:06:37.647,Is... Is it joint pain?
00:06:38.022,00:06:38.856,No.
00:06:43.152,00:06:44.278,It's just because...
00:06:45.321,00:06:52.829,"when you're good at something, other people tend to wanna watch you do it, and I don't need to give people another reason to look at me."
00:06:56.666,00:06:59.252,You just have to be strong in the face of adversity.
00:06:59.544,00:07:01.462,"I mean, that's how I got through high school."
00:07:01.546,00:07:03.923,"Mom, everyone loved you in high school."
00:07:04.966,00:07:06.342,Ten guys asked you to prom.
00:07:06.426,00:07:09.095,"I mean, what adversity did you face, exactly?"
00:07:09.387,00:07:13.808,"Well, I was not popular with the girls in my class because I was so beautiful."
00:07:14.684,00:07:17.687,"I mean, I had to say no to nine suitors."
00:07:18.020,00:07:19.147,It was very stressful.
00:07:19.230,00:07:21.566,"It was a lot of pressure. I was like, No, no."
00:07:21.649,00:07:24.152,Don't call again. No. Maybe. Flirt a little.
00:07:24.235,00:07:25.736,"Flirty, flirty. Still no."
00:07:26.195,00:07:27.447,"No, no."
00:07:28.197,00:07:29.031,Eh.
00:07:29.115,00:07:30.616,"No, no."
00:07:30.700,00:07:32.660,"Anyway, does that count as adversity?"
00:07:33.077,00:07:34.829,"No, it doesn't."
00:07:39.333,00:07:40.960,Oh! I love it! That's the one.
00:07:41.043,00:07:42.420,But I have 27 more upstairs.
00:07:42.503,00:07:45.882,"No, no, no, don't even bother. It's... It's perfect."
00:07:53.514,00:07:54.974,Ew. Ugh!
00:07:55.057,00:07:58.269,You wanna wipe your hand. Don't touch your dress with that hand.
00:07:59.395,00:08:01.772,"Get a tissue, please."
00:08:04.692,00:08:05.526,Nine?
00:08:05.610,00:08:06.444,"Yes, nine!"
00:08:06.527,00:08:09.405,There was only 40 people in our class.
00:08:16.746,00:08:20.750,"And you may be asking, why is he carrying his books in a milk crate?"
00:08:21.375,00:08:25.713,"Well, I've been friends with him for years, and that's still a mystery to me."
00:08:26.130,00:08:30.635,What's even more of a mystery is why he's crazy about someone twice his size.
00:08:30.927,00:08:32.261,-Good mornin'. -Hi.
00:08:32.762,00:08:35.348,"So David Blaine called me, you'll never believe it."
00:08:35.431,00:08:37.600,He wants to know when you and I will make magic together.
00:08:38.059,00:08:40.603,"You do this every day. Dunkleman, it's never gonna happen."
00:08:41.687,00:08:43.105,I made you a smoothie.
00:08:46.943,00:08:54.575,"Okay, it would be weird. We've known each other for so long, and dating a guy who's shorter than me would just draw more attention to how much of a freak I am."
00:08:54.659,00:08:56.994,"Wait, but half the guys in this school are shorter than you are."
00:08:57.286,00:08:58.829,Hence my conundrum.
00:08:58.913,00:09:01.749,"Oh, ho, ho. I would love nothing more than to hence your conundrum."
00:09:01.832,00:09:03.960,All I'm saying is let your freak flag fly.
00:09:04.293,00:09:07.213,Date a short guy. Wear high heels. Do something crazy.
00:09:07.296,00:09:09.757,They don't make heels in size 13 men's.
00:09:09.840,00:09:11.467,"Even if they did, I wouldn't wear them."
00:09:11.551,00:09:15.596,"Look, I know I don't have everything on your perfect boyfriend checklist, okay?"
00:09:15.680,00:09:20.059,"But, you know, I'd be willing to bet I'm clocking in at around... 70%."
00:09:24.063,00:09:25.189,Mm...
00:09:25.606,00:09:26.524,Fifty percent?
00:09:26.607,00:09:28.234,It's a very specific checklist.
00:09:28.776,00:09:38.494,"I just think it's crazy you won't go out with me just 'cause what? You think that at any moment, some taller-than-you, funny, intelligent, nice, perfect guy is just gonna walk through that door?"
00:09:38.578,00:09:41.080,"I mean, that's... Come on. That's crazy."
00:09:59.432,00:10:02.310,We have a foreign exchange student joining us today.
00:10:02.393,00:10:06.230,"He comes to us all the way from Sweden, and he'll be with us the rest of the school year."
00:10:06.522,00:10:09.275,So be nice and please welcome Stig Mohlin.
00:10:14.071,00:10:17.199,"Okay, yeah, okay, the guy is decent-looking."
00:10:17.700,00:10:23.497,"Yeah, that's, you know, that's obvious, but, you know, you don't know him. He's probably dumb as a..."
00:10:30.129,00:10:32.298,What's... What's he doing?
00:10:39.180,00:10:40.139,Okay.
00:10:51.275,00:10:52.610,"He didn't even look at me, okay."
00:10:52.693,00:10:56.906,"It's the first time in my life that I've ever wanted someone to look at me, and he doesn't."
00:11:00.242,00:11:01.202,I'm not?
00:11:02.703,00:11:04.705,"Jodi, the dude's from Sweden."
00:11:04.789,00:11:06.832,It's an entire country filled with giants.
00:11:07.208,00:11:08.542,"To him, you're just another girl."
00:11:10.920,00:11:12.672,-I'm going in. Teeth check? -Ugh!
00:11:12.755,00:11:14.715,-Huge piece of broccoli. -Where?
00:11:15.716,00:11:17.218,"Liz, you're the worst."
00:11:17.802,00:11:18.886,Go get him!
00:11:20.888,00:11:22.348,"Ugh, forever alone."
00:11:27.436,00:11:36.404,"Travel enthusiast, future real estate agent, or some other occupation that involves her face on a bench, and one of my OTs..."
00:11:36.737,00:11:39.657,original tormentors since childhood.
00:11:42.952,00:11:46.080,"Jodi's hand is so big, it doesn't even fit on the clay."
00:11:46.664,00:11:48.124,We're gonna need more paint.
00:12:03.431,00:12:06.892,And that's why I want to be just like Taylor Swift when I grow up.
00:12:07.184,00:12:10.104,Taylor Swift? More like Taller Swift.
00:12:13.899,00:12:15.484,"Oh, that's a good one, Kimmy."
00:12:27.413,00:12:29.290,"Nice sweatpants, Sasquatch."
00:12:34.336,00:12:35.629,"Hey, new guy. I'm Kimmy."
00:12:38.132,00:12:41.677,"-How're you liking America so far? -Oh, I'm liking America very much so far."
00:12:44.597,00:12:45.973,You speak Swedish?
00:12:47.433,00:12:49.769,Picked up back in 2012 on a family vacay to Stockholm.
00:12:49.852,00:12:51.771,"Oh, it's so beautiful there, right?"
00:12:52.146,00:12:55.649,"Yeah, America's great, but I do know nothing about New Orleans."
00:12:55.983,00:12:57.568,Consider me your cultural ambassador.
00:12:58.027,00:12:59.028,Walk with me.
00:13:00.821,00:13:05.326,"I mean, the guy got out of Customs, what, an hour ago, and she's already marking her territory."
00:13:05.409,00:13:06.535,"Jodi, Jodi, Jodi."
00:13:06.827,00:13:15.461,"Look, all right. I know you want to date some guy that's, like, taller than you and stuff, but if you think about it, there could be some major consequences. You know, it could backfire big-time."
00:13:15.836,00:13:17.129,"Okay, backfire how?"
00:13:17.213,00:13:20.007,I'm glad you asked. Let me paint you a word picture.
00:13:20.090,00:13:21.634,How long is this picture gonna take?
00:13:21.717,00:13:22.968,Just let me do my thing.
00:13:23.052,00:13:28.057,"So, let's say that you and Stig date, okay?"
00:13:28.140,00:13:33.521,"You, uh, fall in love, stick together through college, down the line you get married, have a baby."
00:13:33.938,00:13:41.946,And the combined strength of your tall gene and his tall gene creates a zygote in your belly the size of an above-average sized watermelon.
00:13:42.029,00:13:46.826,Okay? So that would mean that that puppy's coming out Caesarean.
00:13:46.909,00:13:55.960,"Through the side door. Do you really wanna go through the rest your life with a big, old scar on that beautiful torso of yours, 'cause, you know, it's what you're asking for."
00:13:56.460,00:13:57.545,He makes a valid point.
00:14:11.517,00:14:12.935,"Mom, what are you doing with the jumbo Swede?"
00:14:13.269,00:14:15.813,"Well, he's gonna be staying with us. We're his host family."
00:14:16.188,00:14:17.147,What?
00:14:17.231,00:14:24.613,"Yeah! I wanted to introduce myself to you at school today, tell you the great news, but your mom wanted it to be a surprise, so, -surprise! -Surprise!"
00:14:24.697,00:14:26.407,-Got him. -Why?
00:14:28.868,00:14:29.952,Because!
00:14:30.035,00:14:37.710,"With all the chaos going on in the world today, there's never been a more vital time for humanity to open our doors to strangers from foreign lands."
00:14:38.168,00:14:41.505,"Mom, the '60s are over, okay? And you weren't even in them."
00:14:41.922,00:14:46.385,"Oh, Stig, buddy, we're just... we're gonna have to ship you back, man."
00:14:46.760,00:14:48.971,This isn't a busted Xbox you bought on eBay.
00:14:49.054,00:14:50.431,This is a human being.
00:14:50.514,00:14:53.642,A human being who wants to experience what America is all about.
00:14:53.726,00:14:54.643,"You know what, Mom?"
00:14:54.727,00:14:59.773,You know what? What better way for him to experience what America's all about than for us to just kick him out of it?
00:14:59.857,00:15:00.983,You get in the car!
00:15:02.234,00:15:03.152,But I sit shotgun.
00:15:03.444,00:15:04.403,Now.
00:15:08.991,00:15:10.242,What should we listen to?
00:15:37.603,00:15:41.732,"Okay, for the next three weeks, if you see me eating carbs, I need you to slap me across the face."
00:15:42.024,00:15:43.442,"No, I'm not doing that."
00:15:43.525,00:15:45.444,"Okay, and since when did you start watching carbs?"
00:15:45.527,00:15:47.780,Since Teen Miss Louisiana.
00:15:48.280,00:15:49.782,I'm not taking any chances.
00:15:50.324,00:15:51.241,"Okay, fine."
00:15:51.700,00:15:53.953,"Um, but I-- I need your help with something."
00:15:54.495,00:15:55.496,"Sure, what's up?"
00:15:56.413,00:15:57.456,Um...
00:15:59.333,00:16:01.210,How do I get a guy to notice me?
00:16:02.252,00:16:04.630,"Oh, my..."
00:16:05.464,00:16:06.382,God!
00:16:06.465,00:16:11.303,"Okay, I've been waiting for this day to come my entire life, and I never thought it would, but I'm so glad it's finally here!"
00:16:12.638,00:16:15.975,"Um, the day that you finally come to your big sister and ask her about love."
00:16:16.266,00:16:25.859,"To finally embrace the sublime splendor that is a woman, and to stop dressing like a, no offense, very large little boy."
00:16:26.151,00:16:27.403,So are you gonna help me or not?
00:16:28.237,00:16:30.239,I'm going to Extreme Makeover the crap out of you.
00:16:30.864,00:16:31.699,Okay.
00:16:31.991,00:16:33.367,Who is he?
00:16:33.450,00:16:35.869,He... he is an exchange student...
00:16:35.953,00:16:37.162,-Uh-huh. -...from Sweden.
00:16:37.246,00:16:40.124,"-And, oh, my God, he is so cute. -What did you just say?"
00:16:40.541,00:16:42.251,He is an exchange student.
00:16:42.710,00:16:44.253,Just... What's wrong?
00:16:48.090,00:16:49.091,Walk away.
00:16:49.758,00:16:50.634,Excuse me?
00:16:50.718,00:16:53.012,Just walk away and forget we ever had this conversation.
00:16:53.095,00:16:55.347,"-Okay, but you literally-- -I said walk away, damn it!"
00:16:59.727,00:17:00.769,"Wow, I'm so sorry."
00:17:01.103,00:17:04.356,"-Um... -Yeah, that was-- It's just, an exchange student..."
00:17:04.440,00:17:08.110,"There's, uh, so many factors working against you, you know."
00:17:08.610,00:17:09.695,You meet.
00:17:10.446,00:17:11.697,High visibility.
00:17:12.197,00:17:14.158,Girls circling him like sharks on chum.
00:17:15.743,00:17:17.870,"You know, I snagged an exchange student once."
00:17:18.662,00:17:19.580,Diego.
00:17:20.080,00:17:23.459,"Paraguayan. Hairless. Sweat smelled like cappuccino, light foam."
00:17:24.126,00:17:26.253,All the girls wanted him. It was war.
00:17:27.046,00:17:29.173,I felt like Custer at Battle of the Bulge.
00:17:30.174,00:17:32.134,"Yeah, Custer wasn't at Battle of the Bulge."
00:17:32.217,00:17:35.387,"Yes, he was. I'm learning about him right now in American History class."
00:17:35.929,00:17:38.766,Nunez Community College makes you take an American History class?
00:17:38.849,00:17:45.898,"A requirement for the Hotel Management degree! The point is, if you want a guy to notice you, you'd have to be willing to go all the way."
00:17:45.981,00:17:48.567,I don't think you're willing. Think you're ready to go all the way?
00:17:48.650,00:17:50.277,I don't know what you're talking about.
00:17:50.360,00:17:52.362,Then you just answered your own question.
00:18:12.341,00:18:13.759,"Ja, good morning, Dunkers!"
00:18:15.844,00:18:17.054,See you at breakfast.
00:18:42.538,00:18:45.624,"Look, man, I feel like we could be friends if you just gave me a chance on this."
00:18:45.707,00:18:48.293,"Look, you're a nice enough guy. But it's just not gonna work."
00:18:48.377,00:18:49.962,"Dunkers, man. Why not?"
00:18:50.045,00:18:52.881,Because I can't be seen around you. And stop calling me Dunkers!
00:18:52.965,00:18:54.341,Why can't you be seen with me?
00:18:54.758,00:18:55.801,-You wanna know why? -Yeah.
00:18:55.884,00:18:57.010,You make me UBC.
00:18:58.387,00:18:59.263,Ubc?
00:18:59.346,00:19:01.306,"No, you-- Ugly by comparison."
00:19:01.390,00:19:05.936,"Look, when I'm not around you, I am a strong six, weak seven."
00:19:06.520,00:19:09.857,"But when I am around you, I'm barely a three, like, barely."
00:19:09.940,00:19:11.942,"Yeah, but, dude, I don't know anybody at school."
00:19:13.819,00:19:16.488,"Trust me, you're gonna have no trouble making friends."
00:19:31.837,00:19:34.756,"Guys, come on. He's not that attractive, is he?"
00:19:46.226,00:19:48.478,"Well, this is about to get interesting."
00:19:55.777,00:19:56.820,Wow.
00:19:58.238,00:19:59.698,Like sharks to chum.
00:20:12.711,00:20:13.712,I'm going in.
00:20:14.546,00:20:15.380,You are?
00:20:18.425,00:20:19.801,"No, of course I'm not..."
00:20:20.552,00:20:21.553,going in.
00:20:35.817,00:20:38.487,This is like watching a UFC cage match.
00:20:39.279,00:20:41.657,But with less body slams and more crop tops.
00:20:52.251,00:20:53.126,Ladies.
00:21:01.385,00:21:05.639,"Oh, oh, oh, oh! And we have a winner! Ah!"
00:21:08.016,00:21:09.476,"Uh, I'm going to Spanish."
00:21:14.231,00:21:16.942,"you picked up Spanish vacationing in Barcelona, right?"
00:21:32.624,00:21:35.335,It's been over a week and she hasn't left his side.
00:21:35.419,00:21:37.504,"Every time I see him, they're together."
00:21:37.796,00:21:41.842,"They eat lunch together, they go to PE together, they walk home from school together every day."
00:21:43.969,00:21:46.430,Sounds like it's mostly just eating and strolling.
00:21:46.513,00:21:47.639,Could be a lot worse.
00:21:59.318,00:22:00.319,This is worse.
00:22:00.861,00:22:06.533,"It's like I've been in love with this girl since elementary school, and this new guy just steps in and blows up my seven-year plan."
00:22:06.616,00:22:12.247,"Like, that's not cool, and he's going to end up with Kimmy, and Jodi'll spend the rest of her life pining for the one guy taller than her."
00:22:12.331,00:22:13.790,And where does that leave me?
00:22:14.207,00:22:18.503,Sometimes I wonder what it'd be like to go to lunch with my friends and have them ask me about my problems.
00:22:18.587,00:22:19.713,"Oh, and furthermore..."
00:22:38.231,00:22:41.485,"...the past couple weeks, and you got skills."
00:22:42.569,00:22:47.407,"A little Pollock, a little Monet, a touch of Rembrandt."
00:22:47.491,00:22:49.368,Are you just naming artists you know?
00:22:49.743,00:22:52.537,"Da Vinci, Picasso, Matisse?"
00:22:54.331,00:22:55.665,Am I that obvious?
00:22:57.125,00:22:59.836,"Well, I like what you're doing with the Van Gogh there."
00:23:00.087,00:23:01.797,"Oh, well, look who's the artist-dropper now."
00:23:19.231,00:23:20.315,Whatcha doing?
00:23:21.900,00:23:25.612,Playing Pachelbel's Canon on wine glasses may have been enough to win Teen Miss New Orleans...
00:23:27.572,00:23:31.910,"but if I wanna win Teen Miss Louisiana, I gotta step up my game."
00:23:35.956,00:23:36.790,Cool.
00:23:38.208,00:23:39.209,"So, um..."
00:23:40.127,00:23:41.253,I'm ready to go all the way.
00:23:43.505,00:23:44.881,Then let's get to work.
00:23:45.424,00:23:46.258,Okay.
00:23:49.344,00:23:50.720,"Jesus, Harper!"
00:23:51.054,00:23:52.472,You almost killed me.
00:24:00.230,00:24:01.189,"Mm, too vampy."
00:24:05.068,00:24:07.696,"No, no, no, that's just the name of this one, Speak Louder."
00:24:07.779,00:24:08.655,My bad.
00:24:10.407,00:24:12.200,I look like Grandma's couch.
00:24:12.284,00:24:15.036,Or a beautiful mermaid princess!
00:24:16.329,00:24:17.956,"Okay, no. Harper, no!"
00:24:18.290,00:24:19.166,"Oh, that one."
00:24:19.249,00:24:21.334,187 Duo Brush!
00:24:21.418,00:24:22.419,Goat fiber.
00:24:22.502,00:24:23.920,Did you have to bring Mom along?
00:24:24.004,00:24:25.464,Fixing you is a two-person job.
00:24:26.047,00:24:28.091,You were awesome on Good Morning New Orleans!
00:24:28.175,00:24:29.050,Focus!
00:24:29.134,00:24:30.051,Okay.
00:24:32.721,00:24:34.514,Now we're talking!
00:24:34.598,00:24:36.433,You look great.
00:24:37.017,00:24:39.269,"Thank you, Mom, but it's just... It's not me."
00:24:41.146,00:24:42.022,Okay.
00:24:42.939,00:24:46.943,I would like to see some layers around her face to accentuate that fabulous bone structure.
00:24:47.027,00:24:52.866,"Maybe an inch or two off in the back, but leave the length, followed by some honey-blonde lowlights all around."
00:24:52.949,00:24:54.743,"Jodi, what do you think?"
00:24:54.826,00:24:57.829,So you're telling me that a lip gloss and a lip glass are two different things?
00:24:57.913,00:25:00.207,"Stop stressing, little sister."
00:25:00.499,00:25:03.001,Tomorrow we're gonna bring that little Swedish boy to his knees.
00:25:03.251,00:25:05.170,-Not so sure about that. -Jodi!
00:25:05.921,00:25:07.464,"Listen to me, okay?"
00:25:07.547,00:25:12.552,"If I had that kind of attitude, I don't think I ever would've gotten that job with the Hilton Corporation."
00:25:12.636,00:25:15.555,You have an unpaid internship at the Residence Inn.
00:25:17.349,00:25:18.308,Silly.
00:25:24.814,00:25:26.816,Now this is me.
00:25:28.401,00:25:29.611,You look stunning.
00:25:52.634,00:25:53.468,Hello?
00:25:57.097,00:25:59.432,"Uh, yeah. Yeah, this is Jodi."
00:25:59.516,00:26:02.894,"Hi, uh, my name's Stig. I'm the new exchange student in your school."
00:26:04.896,00:26:05.855,Hello?
00:26:06.648,00:26:09.150,"Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi. Hi. Um..."
00:26:09.609,00:26:12.112,"Uh, how may I help you?"
00:26:12.696,00:26:17.826,"Well, um, I don't know many people at school, and you seem like a really nice person."
00:26:17.909,00:26:22.205,"I was hoping if you didn't have a date yet, you'd want to go with me to the Homecoming dance."
00:26:25.584,00:26:26.960,"Yeah, yeah, sure, sure."
00:26:27.043,00:26:31.840,"I mean, going out with you would be, you know, splendiferous."
00:26:32.173,00:26:37.178,"Now-- Now, that's a word you don't hear nearly enough of, um..."
00:26:39.139,00:26:43.059,"So-- So, I'm guessing that Dunkleman gave you my number?"
00:26:43.143,00:26:47.314,"No, no. I just looked it up in the phone book under Big, ugly giraffe!"
00:26:49.566,00:26:50.609,Schnipper.
00:26:52.402,00:26:53.612,Gotcha.
00:26:54.195,00:26:56.364,"Okay, what the hell is wrong with you?"
00:26:56.823,00:26:59.367,"Oh, don't be so best supporting actress."
00:26:59.451,00:27:01.453,I saw the way you were looking at Stig in art class.
00:27:01.786,00:27:03.872,Your jaw was practically on the floor.
00:27:03.955,00:27:06.082,"So, Schnipper and I just thought we'd have a little fun."
00:27:06.166,00:27:07.167,What up?
00:27:07.584,00:27:11.338,"Besides, you really don't think a guy as hot as Stig would be into you, do you?"
00:27:11.963,00:27:13.590,"I mean, let's face it, Jodi."
00:27:13.673,00:27:16.426,You're the tall girl. You'll never be the pretty girl.
00:27:19.679,00:27:20.555,"Yeah, well."
00:27:39.366,00:27:40.533,There's a whole outfit.
00:27:40.617,00:27:43.078,"There's makeup, there's hair. It's a process."
00:27:43.161,00:27:44.287,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah."
00:27:49.709,00:27:50.543,Wow!
00:27:59.386,00:28:00.470,-Yes! -Yeah.
00:28:20.490,00:28:22.659,"-Hey! What up, Stig? -Ah, not much, Jake!"
00:28:23.827,00:28:25.704,You became real popular real fast.
00:28:25.787,00:28:27.914,"-Hey, Stig. -Oh, hi, Sheila!"
00:28:27.997,00:28:29.332,"Okay, like, really, really fast."
00:28:29.416,00:28:31.418,"Jeez, it's one week and everyone knows your name?"
00:28:31.501,00:28:33.503,"-Yeah, it's-- -And you're dating Kimmy."
00:28:33.795,00:28:36.673,Right? I still don't get why everyone wants to be friends with me.
00:28:37.048,00:28:39.134,Or why a girl as pretty as Kimmy would want to date me.
00:28:39.217,00:28:40.301,What are you talking about?
00:28:40.385,00:28:41.803,"Well, look at me."
00:28:44.305,00:28:45.181,Yeah?
00:28:45.640,00:28:46.641,I'm a dork.
00:28:46.725,00:28:47.600,What do you mean?
00:28:48.017,00:28:57.152,"It's kind of embarrassing, but in my high school back home, there's all these super good-looking, super popular, tall guys, you know?"
00:28:58.820,00:28:59.779,I'm not one of them.
00:29:00.155,00:29:04.743,"I'm sorry, what you're telling me is that in your home country, this, all this..."
00:29:04.826,00:29:05.827,This is ugly?
00:29:06.119,00:29:08.163,"Oh, yeah, of course, man."
00:29:10.790,00:29:11.624,Why?
00:29:11.708,00:29:15.211,"Well, it's just, you know, if that's true, then that makes you the me of Sweden."
00:29:15.462,00:29:16.296,I am?
00:29:16.963,00:29:18.256,"Man, that's trippy."
00:29:19.257,00:29:21.509,"If I'm the you of Sweden, then, I mean..."
00:29:22.552,00:29:23.595,who am I here?
00:29:23.928,00:29:26.306,"Well, who's the most popular, good-looking guy at your school?"
00:29:26.389,00:29:31.102,"The guy that all the girls want to date and, you know, -everyone wants to be friends with? -Ingvar Krueger."
00:29:31.394,00:29:32.353,That's you here.
00:29:32.896,00:29:34.105,You're Ingvar Krueger.
00:29:37.150,00:29:38.067,I'm Ingvar Krueger.
00:29:39.611,00:29:42.322,"-I'm Ingvar Krueger, Dunkers! -Yeah, that's what I'm saying, man."
00:29:42.655,00:29:44.866,"Man, I'd be, um, screwed in Sweden, huh?"
00:29:49.996,00:29:51.581,Out. Now.
00:29:51.831,00:29:53.458,Excuse me. I'm reading.
00:29:53.708,00:29:54.876,You're hiding.
00:29:56.503,00:29:57.754,I don't want to run into Kimmy.
00:29:58.129,00:29:59.714,"She prank called you, Jodi."
00:29:59.798,00:30:00.673,So what?
00:30:00.757,00:30:03.802,"Easy for you to say. Okay, nothing rattles you."
00:30:04.093,00:30:07.096,Plenty of stuff rattles me. I just roll with it.
00:30:07.514,00:30:09.349,"Well, this is how I roll."
00:30:11.142,00:30:12.519,"I like your outfit, by the way."
00:30:12.811,00:30:14.354,Might be one of your best designs.
00:30:14.854,00:30:16.147,Don't change the subject.
00:30:17.023,00:30:20.235,"Okay, Gulliver, let's see what trouble you get into next."
00:30:23.321,00:30:28.827,"One day, Jodi, one day when you get picked on and made fun of, you're not gonna hide in a bathroom stall."
00:30:29.410,00:30:32.038,"You're gonna stand up and say, This is me."
00:30:32.330,00:30:37.085,"I love all 73 inches of myself, and there's nothing you can do that will change that."
00:30:37.502,00:30:39.212,That is my wish for you.
00:30:40.296,00:30:42.674,I just hope I'm there to see it.
00:30:44.801,00:30:47.804,You're not seriously flushing the toilet to avoid having this conversa...
00:31:19.502,00:31:21.004,Did you want to use the piano?
00:31:23.548,00:31:26.885,"I have a few minutes before my next class, so I'm just in here messing around a bit."
00:31:27.552,00:31:29.012,"No, no, no, go ahead. Go ahead."
00:31:51.951,00:31:52.827,Relax your hands.
00:31:54.287,00:31:55.163,"I'm sorry, what?"
00:31:55.496,00:31:59.292,Y-- You're just trying so hard to hit the right notes that your fingers are tensing up.
00:31:59.375,00:32:01.127,So just relax your hands.
00:32:01.794,00:32:03.296,All right. Relax.
00:32:06.382,00:32:07.342,Right.
00:32:19.979,00:32:21.064,Not bad.
00:32:22.565,00:32:23.566,It's better.
00:32:23.816,00:32:25.985,"Yeah. Wow, thank you."
00:32:26.069,00:32:27.612,You should play something now.
00:32:27.695,00:32:30.698,"-No, no, I don't really play much anymore. -Oh, come on."
00:32:30.782,00:32:34.285,"I mean, I have a feeling that you're probably better at this than I am."
00:32:34.661,00:32:38.081,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm okay, but only because of these."
00:32:39.332,00:32:40.375,Your hands?
00:32:40.708,00:32:43.252,"Yeah, I would hope that you use your hands to play the piano."
00:32:43.711,00:32:45.588,"No, no, I-- I mean, um..."
00:32:46.130,00:32:48.925,That's why there are more male classical pianists than female.
00:32:49.008,00:32:51.803,"You know, bigger hands, they move faster, cover more ground, so..."
00:32:52.720,00:32:54.430,Lucky me. My hands...
00:32:54.514,00:32:55.932,Could I-- Can I see 'em?
00:32:57.141,00:32:58.101,Yeah.
00:33:04.065,00:33:06.359,Yeah. You've got big hands.
00:33:08.152,00:33:10.363,"So you probably could play this, then, right?"
00:33:13.449,00:33:15.702,"It's Guys and Dolls, it's my favorite musical."
00:33:17.954,00:33:19.956,"-You like musicals? Oh, my God. -I do."
00:33:20.039,00:33:21.916,You should have seen me in Sweden. I was in Cats.
00:33:22.000,00:33:24.335,"-Oh, my God, me, too! -No, were you really?"
00:33:25.420,00:33:26.337,No.
00:33:27.922,00:33:30.800,"No, I-- I don't know why I said that, actually."
00:33:31.217,00:33:33.136,But you should play this with me.
00:33:34.137,00:33:35.638,Come on. Here.
00:33:49.610,00:33:50.778,Relax your hands.
00:33:51.654,00:33:53.197,I got that one. Thanks.
00:35:10.775,00:35:13.152,Been looking for you. I thought we were walking to class together.
00:35:13.236,00:35:17.240,"Yeah, yeah, we're just having a little, uh, impromptu concert here with, um..."
00:35:17.698,00:35:18.616,Jodi.
00:35:18.699,00:35:21.244,"Uh, Jodi. It's-- It's nice to formally meet you."
00:35:21.702,00:35:26.582,"I'm, uh, I'm Stig, and, uh, this is my girlfriend, Kimmy."
00:35:29.836,00:35:32.964,"Yeah. Girlfriend, girlfriend."
00:35:33.047,00:35:34.841,"Had the talk last night, made it offish."
00:35:35.383,00:35:38.302,"Stiggy, baby, would you mind getting Mama a Diet Slice before class?"
00:35:38.386,00:35:40.304,Yeah. Sure.
00:35:46.227,00:35:47.103,"See ya, Jodi."
00:35:51.023,00:35:53.526,"-What are you playing at, beanstalk? -What are you talking about?"
00:35:53.818,00:35:55.695,"-You're moving in on my man. -No, I'm not."
00:35:55.778,00:35:58.364,So it's a coincidence the two of you happened to be here together?
00:35:58.447,00:35:59.782,-Yeah. -Stay away from him.
00:35:59.866,00:36:00.700,I will.
00:36:00.783,00:36:02.702,Stig and I will be Homecoming king and queen.
00:36:02.785,00:36:03.744,I don't doubt it.
00:36:03.828,00:36:06.247,-Stop agreeing with everything I'm saying! -Okay.
00:36:07.081,00:36:08.166,Ugh!
00:36:29.145,00:36:30.855,Hm. Excuse me.
00:36:32.607,00:36:33.441,Hey.
00:36:33.691,00:36:34.734,"Dad, what is going on?"
00:36:35.526,00:36:36.402,What do you mean?
00:36:37.403,00:36:41.032,"I mean, why is our house filled with a bunch of ridiculously tall people?"
00:36:41.490,00:36:42.533,Who are they?
00:36:42.742,00:36:45.745,"Oh, just some friends that I invited over for a little get-together."
00:36:46.078,00:36:49.498,"Okay, well, why are all your friends wearing hats that say Tip Toppers?"
00:36:49.832,00:36:59.258,"Well, that's because they are not only a group of friends, but they're also, you know, like, a group."
00:36:59.717,00:37:00.968,You mean a club.
00:37:01.052,00:37:02.845,No. Not a club.
00:37:02.929,00:37:04.722,Clubs are lame. Ugh.
00:37:04.805,00:37:11.979,"Crystal Spitz, Chairmen of the Tip Toppers seven years running, and it's about to be eight unless Bob Brickman over there beats me in the next election."
00:37:12.063,00:37:13.147,"Which you won't, Bob!"
00:37:13.231,00:37:14.607,"Oh, we'll see, Crystal."
00:37:18.945,00:37:23.908,"Anyhow, your parents were so kind to open up their home for us for our weekly chapter meeting."
00:37:24.408,00:37:25.993,Chapter meeting for what?
00:37:26.077,00:37:27.203,For our tall club.
00:37:29.622,00:37:32.416,Tall club? The Tip Toppers is a tall club?
00:37:32.875,00:37:36.420,Tall Club International has over 200 chapters in the US alone.
00:37:37.004,00:37:41.217,"The Tip Toppers are the third-largest, although, with our newest member..."
00:37:41.300,00:37:46.222,"-No, no, no. -...bringing up the tally to 24, we are now officially tied for second!"
00:37:52.270,00:37:55.398,"Tip Toppers, I think you need to sing your theme song!"
00:37:56.691,00:37:57.984,"No, no, no, Tip Toppers."
00:38:18.087,00:38:21.215,"Jodi, come on, don't be mad at me."
00:38:22.925,00:38:23.843,"Look, I..."
00:38:24.760,00:38:27.930,I thought it would be nice hanging out with other tall people.
00:38:28.389,00:38:32.685,And-- And then you could see that they're perfectly okay being tall.
00:38:33.728,00:38:34.687,Being tall sucks.
00:38:34.770,00:38:38.357,"Seriously. I only come to these meetings for, like, the free food and the guys."
00:38:38.607,00:38:40.192,"Bathroom's this way, right?"
00:38:40.985,00:38:42.153,Ow!
00:38:45.364,00:38:48.284,"Jodi, I just want you to feel normal."
00:38:51.245,00:38:58.586,"Don't you realize that-- that every time you try to make me feel more normal, you just end up making me feel like more of a freak?"
00:39:15.936,00:39:18.439,Height reduction surgery.
00:39:24.111,00:39:25.738,Let's see.
00:39:28.199,00:39:31.202,"Costs $150,000."
00:39:32.411,00:39:35.039,But I know a guy in India who will do it for cheap.
00:39:35.706,00:39:42.797,"Very long recovery time, extremely painful, but when I learned to walk again, it was worth it."
00:39:43.839,00:39:46.008,Why couldn't I have just been normal?
00:39:52.973,00:39:53.808,Hello?
00:39:53.891,00:39:56.227,"Hi, Jodi, this is Stig from school."
00:39:56.811,00:39:58.396,"You know what, Schnipper?"
00:39:59.105,00:40:03.317,"You really chose the wrong day to mess with me, okay?"
00:40:03.401,00:40:10.074,"The next time I see you, I'm gonna take my size 13 Nikes and I'm gonna kick you in the nards hard."
00:40:10.157,00:40:11.909,"Okay, do-- do you understand me?"
00:40:11.992,00:40:17.915,My big feet plus your tiny little nards equals pain.
00:40:26.132,00:40:28.092,"And, uh, and, um..."
00:40:29.218,00:40:32.471,"This really is Stig, isn't it?"
00:40:33.305,00:40:34.723,"Yeah, yeah."
00:40:36.434,00:40:39.895,"I'm-- I'm really sorry. I, um..."
00:40:42.314,00:40:44.525,I thought that you were someone else.
00:40:44.608,00:40:46.527,"Oh, it's okay. I, um..."
00:40:47.027,00:40:50.072,I hope I'm not bothering you. I-- I just wanted to know if...
00:40:50.573,00:40:55.244,if maybe you wanted to come over tonight and watch a musical with me.
00:41:00.916,00:41:01.876,Jodi?
00:41:17.099,00:41:18.100,Hi.
00:41:20.019,00:41:21.103,How's it goin'?
00:41:29.820,00:41:32.573,"Battle Royale partner, Shoshi from Okinawa, but hey."
00:41:32.990,00:41:33.991,Hi.
00:41:34.074,00:41:35.659,"I look ridiculous, don't I?"
00:41:35.743,00:41:36.994,-I-- I'm gonna go. -What?
00:41:41.874,00:41:44.543,You... You look amazing.
00:41:45.169,00:41:46.879,"-Really? -Yeah, I..."
00:41:47.630,00:41:50.549,I'm just shocked. You look a little overdressed for a study night.
00:41:53.844,00:41:54.929,"Wow, hi."
00:41:57.056,00:41:59.308,"Um, thanks for coming over."
00:41:59.934,00:42:02.353,Thanks for inviting me.
00:42:02.436,00:42:03.854,Please come in.
00:42:06.148,00:42:07.107,"Bye, Dunk."
00:42:44.979,00:42:46.689,"Oh, you guys watching this?"
00:42:47.398,00:42:48.274,Yeah.
00:42:49.316,00:42:50.150,Okay.
00:43:14.425,00:43:15.509,Who laughs at your jokes?
00:43:16.635,00:43:17.845,I'm so silly.
00:43:20.889,00:43:21.807,Forgot.
00:43:22.766,00:43:23.809,"Be right back, guys."
00:43:30.149,00:43:31.525,I'm so sorry.
00:43:32.359,00:43:33.360,It's fine.
00:43:36.322,00:43:42.036,I see a lot of ingredients here that I can use for a nice little smoothie.
00:43:44.622,00:43:46.081,Fruits and such.
00:43:46.165,00:43:49.585,"Hit the gym today, so I'll throw some protein powder in there."
00:43:49.668,00:43:50.711,That's always good.
00:43:51.211,00:43:52.546,Get those gains.
00:43:55.424,00:43:57.217,He doesn't seem to want to leave us alone.
00:43:57.301,00:43:58.927,"Appears that way, yeah."
00:44:01.930,00:44:04.683,"Do you think maybe I should just ask if, you know..."
00:44:05.559,00:44:07.436,"Yeah, I think that'd be a good idea."
00:44:08.479,00:44:09.647,"Hey, Dunkers."
00:44:09.730,00:44:10.606,Yeah?
00:44:13.108,00:44:15.319,"-Yeah, pal? -Do you want to watch the movie with us?"
00:44:20.658,00:44:22.201,That's such a great idea!
00:44:24.953,00:44:26.914,"All right, cozy time. That's good."
00:44:26.997,00:44:28.123,It's super cozy.
00:44:28.999,00:44:30.292,Pssh. Where you going?
00:44:45.724,00:44:48.227,"But if... If I just, like..."
00:44:49.770,00:44:50.729,Yeah.
00:44:53.440,00:44:54.608,Um...
00:44:58.445,00:44:59.697,There we go.
00:45:00.239,00:45:01.198,Yeah.
00:45:01.281,00:45:02.408,That's better.
00:45:06.620,00:45:09.957,"So, um, where's your girlfriend tonight?"
00:45:10.416,00:45:11.500,At some party.
00:45:13.460,00:45:14.294,Probably.
00:45:15.129,00:45:16.130,"And, um..."
00:45:17.256,00:45:20.092,"you're my only friend I'd want to watch a musical with, so..."
00:45:21.051,00:45:22.678,"Yeah, right."
00:45:24.513,00:45:26.098,She's so pretty...
00:45:26.932,00:45:27.933,Kimmy.
00:45:28.225,00:45:31.186,"But she can be so insecure sometimes, you know?"
00:45:32.062,00:45:33.564,-Insecure? -Yeah.
00:45:33.897,00:45:39.903,"After she saw us together in the music room, she just kept saying, like, Oh, was it really coincidence that you two were together?"
00:45:40.487,00:45:41.780,Do you think she's prettier than me?
00:45:41.864,00:45:47.995,"Okay, Kimmy Stitcher is not insecure about anything or anyone, especially not me."
00:45:49.830,00:45:51.623,"I mean, why-- why wouldn't she be?"
00:45:52.416,00:45:54.918,Because there's nothing to be insecure about.
00:45:55.711,00:45:58.547,"I mean, Kimmy's... She's perfect."
00:46:00.048,00:46:02.968,I'm... this.
00:46:03.635,00:46:06.638,Are you serious? Being tall is great.
00:46:06.722,00:46:09.725,"Being a tall guy is-- is great, but..."
00:46:12.227,00:46:15.481,"when you're tall girl, it's-- it's the only thing that people see."
00:46:16.523,00:46:18.025,It's not the only thing I see.
00:46:18.942,00:46:20.027,What do you see?
00:46:20.736,00:46:21.570,I don't know.
00:46:23.197,00:46:24.573,It's not a tall girl.
00:46:25.824,00:46:26.950,Just a girl.
00:46:28.577,00:46:32.581,"A really smart, fun, unique..."
00:46:35.292,00:46:36.919,beautiful girl.
00:46:48.514,00:46:49.681,I-- I'm sorry.
00:46:51.225,00:46:52.309,I'm not.
00:47:22.089,00:47:23.298,What are you wearing?
00:47:23.549,00:47:36.979,"Allie McKinney, Miss Teen Florida 1993, states in her autobiography, The Crowning Achievement, that the key to a perfect-fitting dress is to buy one that is three sizes too small and to wear it two hours a day one week before the event to fit it to your exact body size."
00:47:37.396,00:47:38.897,Can you even breathe in that thing?
00:47:38.981,00:47:42.734,Just forget about whether or not-- Forget about whether or not I can breathe.
00:47:42.818,00:47:43.694,Okay.
00:47:44.653,00:47:47.447,What happened with the Swede?
00:47:48.448,00:47:50.784,"Uh, we just watched a movie."
00:47:51.743,00:47:52.828,"Okay, yeah."
00:47:53.412,00:47:56.039,And then he invited Dunkleman to watch it with us.
00:47:56.123,00:47:57.207,Oh.
00:47:57.374,00:47:58.500,"And then, uh..."
00:47:59.293,00:48:00.752,he called me his friend.
00:48:02.337,00:48:03.171,"And then, uh..."
00:48:04.548,00:48:05.841,then I kissed him.
00:48:10.304,00:48:14.308,"After all that, you kissed him?"
00:48:15.225,00:48:16.184,Mm-hm.
00:48:16.852,00:48:17.811,Yeah.
00:48:18.729,00:48:20.272,Who are you?
00:48:20.689,00:48:28.447,"I don't know. I mean, I wasn't planning on kissing another girl's boyfriend, I mean, even if that girl is Kimmy, but that's not me. I'm not the other woman."
00:48:28.530,00:48:30.032,"I mean, I'm barely a woman."
00:48:30.115,00:48:32.618,"The situation is getting very ugly, very fast."
00:48:34.119,00:48:36.622,Why do you have to gaze out the window when you're talking to me?
00:48:38.373,00:48:41.126,"I mean, if Kimmy ever found out about this-- Is that an English muffin?"
00:48:43.128,00:48:44.004,No.
00:48:44.588,00:48:46.006,It's not an English muffin.
00:48:46.423,00:48:47.382,Don't...
00:48:47.966,00:48:48.884,I just...
00:48:52.638,00:48:53.847,Did you just slap me?
00:48:54.181,00:48:56.475,You told me to slap you if I ever saw you eating carbs.
00:48:56.558,00:48:58.685,"I did, but I didn't expect you to actually do it."
00:48:58.769,00:49:03.273,"-What if you left a permanent mark? -Okay, stop talking about yourself, and tell me how to undo what I just did."
00:49:06.526,00:49:10.614,"You kissed him, and he kissed you back, which means girlfriend or not, you've got a shot at this."
00:49:10.697,00:49:12.616,You are forging ahead. You are in the game.
00:49:12.699,00:49:14.242,Just like General Custer.
00:49:14.618,00:49:17.287,"General Custer, not who you think he is!"
00:49:24.920,00:49:25.879,"Hey, Dunkers."
00:49:26.254,00:49:27.255,Are you awake?
00:49:27.339,00:49:28.507,What? Yeah.
00:49:29.007,00:49:30.175,"Yeah, man, what's up?"
00:49:31.134,00:49:32.678,I have to confess something.
00:49:34.721,00:49:35.931,I cheated on Kimmy tonight.
00:49:37.057,00:49:41.561,"With Jodi, and she kissed me, and I kissed her back, and I..."
00:49:42.062,00:49:43.647,I didn't pull away.
00:49:45.482,00:49:46.733,Am I a horrible person?
00:49:51.154,00:49:52.239,No. People...
00:50:01.456,00:50:02.416,How was it?
00:50:06.294,00:50:08.296,It was different than when I kiss Kimmy.
00:50:08.714,00:50:13.927,"It was really good, Dunkers. It was intense and -passionate, and I could feel her heart-- -Cool."
00:50:14.344,00:50:16.179,"That's enough, you can stop now."
00:50:19.141,00:50:20.308,So what should I do?
00:50:21.435,00:50:24.146,"Uh... You know, man, look."
00:50:24.229,00:50:25.230,Well...
00:50:27.232,00:50:32.738,"You're already in a relationship, you know, so..."
00:50:33.405,00:50:34.531,"So, um..."
00:50:39.578,00:50:42.789,"nurturing, caring for and continuing..."
00:50:44.041,00:50:45.167,that relationship.
00:50:45.250,00:50:48.253,"Right, but Dunkers, what if I like Jodi more than I like Kimmy?"
00:50:50.797,00:50:51.715,Are you okay?
00:50:53.925,00:50:54.968,Good.
00:50:57.345,00:50:59.222,"Look, man, Jodi-- Jodi's great."
00:50:59.806,00:51:00.766,Yeah.
00:51:00.849,00:51:02.559,"And, you know, she smells..."
00:51:04.227,00:51:09.900,"like a late August midday sun-shower, and she's got skin like sweet, buttery whipped cream, but..."
00:51:11.902,00:51:22.454,"You, my friend, are dating the hottest, most popular, most sought-after girl in the whole school, so, you know, if you keep that up, you're in line to be Homecoming King."
00:51:22.537,00:51:25.373,"That's a-- You know, we don't take that lightly around here."
00:51:26.416,00:51:27.250,Right.
00:51:27.918,00:51:33.215,"Soon enough, you'll be back in Sweden and, you know, you'll be living my life again. Ugh!"
00:51:34.049,00:51:36.760,"Right? So you should take advantage of the moment, man."
00:51:36.843,00:51:39.679,This is your chance to be Ingvar Krueger.
00:51:40.097,00:51:41.389,-Right. -Yeah.
00:51:42.599,00:51:45.477,-But here's the thing. -Mm-hm.
00:51:46.895,00:51:49.397,-I could still be friends with Jodi? -Eh...
00:51:49.481,00:51:51.108,-Really? No? -I...
00:51:55.612,00:52:00.617,"you know, and it's probably best for you to cut things off, just cold turkey."
00:52:00.700,00:52:02.452,"You know, it's the American way."
00:52:03.787,00:52:04.704,Yes.
00:52:07.332,00:52:08.291,All right.
00:52:09.209,00:52:10.919,"-I'm-- I'm glad I have you, man. -Yeah."
00:52:11.002,00:52:13.505,I appreciate your honesty. That means a lot to me.
00:52:14.005,00:52:15.048,Mm-hm.
00:52:16.925,00:52:17.968,You kissed Stig?
00:52:18.051,00:52:19.344,Could you keep your voice down?
00:52:19.427,00:52:21.179,-Am I shouting? -Yes.
00:52:21.471,00:52:24.349,"Sorry. But it's a big deal, your first kiss!"
00:52:24.432,00:52:26.434,So how was it? Give me the deets.
00:52:27.519,00:52:28.937,Pretty perfect.
00:52:29.020,00:52:31.231,"I mean, other than the fact that he's dating someone else."
00:52:31.314,00:52:32.816,But am I a terrible person?
00:52:32.899,00:52:35.193,"No, you're not. She is."
00:52:35.277,00:52:37.571,She doesn't deserve him. You do.
00:52:37.863,00:52:40.907,"And I gotta say, I like new Jodi."
00:52:41.533,00:52:42.576,New Jodi?
00:52:42.784,00:52:45.662,Face your fears Jodi. Going after what you want Jodi.
00:52:45.745,00:52:48.582,Look at me 'cause I look good Jodi.
00:52:48.874,00:52:50.542,it's about time you start following your own advice.
00:52:50.917,00:52:52.711,And when did I ever give that advice?
00:52:53.128,00:52:59.050,To me. When you convinced me to stand up to my parents and tell them I wanted to go to fashion school instead of becoming a doctor.
00:52:59.134,00:53:00.302,Ah. Right.
00:53:01.636,00:53:04.139,Do you think they're ever gonna forgive me about that?
00:53:04.556,00:53:06.433,"Oh, no. You're dead to them."
00:53:07.142,00:53:08.643,What's that girl trying to prove?
00:53:08.727,00:53:12.355,"What, does she think makeup and a new haircut's gonna make her less ugly?"
00:53:15.150,00:53:16.735,Do you think she's less ugly?
00:53:17.611,00:53:22.032,"Uh, no, no. No. She's, like, you know, the same amount of ugly, right?"
00:53:24.075,00:53:24.993,Huh?
00:53:25.285,00:53:26.912,"All right, yeah. I mean, look at her."
00:53:27.370,00:53:31.249,"Look at her, she's so confident and feeling herself and..."
00:53:31.708,00:53:34.294,She's like an independent woman with golden locks.
00:53:35.253,00:53:36.588,She looks kinda hot.
00:53:39.424,00:53:40.800,"Look, you better watch your back."
00:54:00.028,00:54:02.739,What happened last night? You didn't respond to my text messages.
00:54:03.865,00:54:04.950,Uh...
00:54:05.367,00:54:07.118,"Yeah, that was funny, actually."
00:54:07.202,00:54:09.496,I-- I left my phone on off.
00:54:09.579,00:54:10.413,Mm.
00:54:10.747,00:54:11.915,"Silent, I mean."
00:54:12.832,00:54:14.542,"No, I think it might be broken."
00:54:17.879,00:54:20.382,"Oh! Dunkers, man! We got a spot."
00:54:21.424,00:54:25.136,"Uh, no, that's fine. I'm just gonna-- No, you're coming over here. Come on."
00:54:28.556,00:54:29.557,Okay.
00:54:30.433,00:54:32.519,This is my roommate. This is Dunkers.
00:54:32.602,00:54:37.816,"Yeah, uh, well, my name's Dunkleman, and I feel like I'm more of a landlord than a roommate, so..."
00:54:41.069,00:54:42.195,He's actually very funny.
00:54:42.279,00:54:43.947,He does these impressions of people.
00:54:44.030,00:54:45.073,"What, impressions?"
00:54:45.156,00:54:46.324,-I don't think-- -The chef one.
00:54:46.408,00:54:47.450,Gordon Ramsay.
00:54:48.660,00:54:49.494,-Mm-hm. -Let's see it!
00:54:49.577,00:54:51.329,"-He's so good at this. -Yeah, Gordon Ramsay."
00:54:53.873,00:54:54.833,Where's the lamb sauce?
00:54:56.626,00:54:58.336,"No, do it. Come on, here. With this."
00:54:58.420,00:54:59.504,"-Oh, with the sushi? -Yeah. Please."
00:55:03.383,00:55:04.718,-Do the sandwich! -You donut.
00:55:08.430,00:55:10.140,An idiot sandwich!
00:55:11.016,00:55:12.392,"Kevin Hart, Kevin Hart!"
00:55:15.520,00:55:17.230,"All right, all right, all right!"
00:55:17.522,00:55:19.357,"Yeah, you know Kevin, how he does that?"
00:55:19.441,00:55:22.193,"That's not a Matthew McConaughey thing. Kevin did it first, actually."
00:55:22.277,00:55:24.070,"You know, walk up to him and he's like..."
00:55:25.405,00:55:26.990,What am I watching?
00:55:27.782,00:55:28.825,Unclear.
00:55:33.830,00:55:35.999,"You're not really gonna eat Glutio's, are you?"
00:55:36.082,00:55:37.042,They taste like sawdust.
00:55:37.334,00:55:40.503,"Well, I can't have gluten and so, you know, kid's gotta snack."
00:55:41.713,00:55:44.090,How about... Try one of these?
00:55:45.467,00:55:46.509,You're gluten-free?
00:55:46.593,00:55:47.802,"Since 2012, baby."
00:55:48.428,00:55:49.387,All right.
00:55:53.683,00:55:55.935,"Hold up, no. That is not gluten-free."
00:55:56.186,00:55:58.271,-Who makes these? -Girls Gone Vegan on Chestnut Street.
00:55:58.563,00:55:59.564,I'll take you.
00:56:01.441,00:56:02.942,Where have you been my whole life?
00:56:05.445,00:56:07.781,-I was talking to the cookie. -Cookie. Yeah. Okay.
00:56:08.698,00:56:09.699,Keep it.
00:56:14.120,00:56:18.083,"So, what, am I not cool enough for you to sit and have lunch with anymore?"
00:56:18.166,00:56:19.417,"No, I was just, um..."
00:56:19.501,00:56:22.962,"Stig asked me to sit by him for lunch, and I didn't want to be rude."
00:56:24.047,00:56:26.383,Did he say anything to you about me recently?
00:56:26.966,00:56:28.635,-Like what? -I don't know.
00:56:29.219,00:56:32.389,"He just avoided me all day today, and I thought we had a fun night last night."
00:56:33.348,00:56:35.141,"-Yeah, I bet you did. -Excuse me?"
00:56:36.393,00:56:38.353,He did say something. What did he say?
00:56:38.436,00:56:40.939,"-I don't know. -Excuse me, I'm talking to you."
00:56:42.190,00:56:43.358,What did he tell you?
00:56:44.734,00:56:47.320,"-Well, he said you guys kissed, okay? -He what?"
00:56:47.404,00:56:48.863,"You're going after a taken man, Jodi."
00:56:48.947,00:56:51.032,"There's plenty of other guys out there, available ones."
00:56:51.116,00:56:52.325,Just tell me what he said.
00:56:52.409,00:56:55.245,"He said he didn't know who he liked more, you or Kimmy."
00:56:55.328,00:56:56.704,He said that? Then what'd you say?
00:56:56.788,00:57:01.376,"I merely implied that, you know, maybe he should focus on the relationship he's already in with Kimmy."
00:57:01.459,00:57:04.921,"Oh, so you're looking out for Kimmy now? I thought you're supposed to be my friend."
00:57:05.004,00:57:06.005,I am your friend.
00:57:06.089,00:57:08.508,"But if you can't have me, nobody can, isn't that the idea?"
00:57:08.591,00:57:10.051,"Jodi, don't flatter yourself."
00:57:10.135,00:57:12.679,I actually have a date with Liz to go to a gluten-free bakery.
00:57:12.762,00:57:15.640,Mm. The start of the beginning of no great love story ever.
00:57:15.723,00:57:20.520,"You may find this hard to believe, but I care about you and I just want to make sure that you don't get hurt."
00:57:24.232,00:57:25.358,Ow!
00:57:27.819,00:57:29.195,What's happened to you?
00:57:29.571,00:57:30.822,Biking's for losers.
00:57:31.322,00:57:32.490,"Hey, can I..."
00:57:32.991,00:57:33.908,Can I talk to you?
00:57:34.451,00:57:35.952,"Yeah, sure. Come in."
00:57:39.164,00:57:40.415,"So, uh..."
00:57:40.874,00:57:41.875,What's up?
00:57:42.834,00:57:46.421,"Oh, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry that I kissed you last night."
00:57:46.629,00:57:48.423,"-Oh, uh, that's okay. -No."
00:57:48.506,00:57:55.054,"It's not. I mean, you have a girlfriend, and I basically threw myself at you, which is probably why you... blew me off today."
00:57:55.346,00:57:57.265,"I just didn't know what to say, honestly."
00:57:57.348,00:57:59.100,"No, no, no, you don't have to say anything."
00:57:59.767,00:58:02.729,"You know, in fact, feel free to just keep blowing me off."
00:58:03.313,00:58:04.314,Really?
00:58:04.731,00:58:05.607,-Yeah. -Why?
00:58:05.690,00:58:14.824,"Because if you don't, then I'm just gonna get my hopes up about happy endings that only happen in movies with actresses that are under six feet."
00:58:15.533,00:58:19.037,"I-- I'd still like to be friends, Jodi, at least."
00:58:19.412,00:58:25.335,"Right, yeah. Friends, like, let's just forget that we kissed and move on -like nothing ever happened. -Yeah."
00:58:25.418,00:58:26.794,"-We could do that, right? -Right."
00:58:26.878,00:58:28.087,"Yeah, yeah, totally."
00:58:28.171,00:58:29.088,"Oh, great."
00:58:29.172,00:58:30.673,"-Yeah, great. -Good, good."
00:58:30.757,00:58:31.841,-Awesome. -Um...
00:58:34.302,00:58:35.303,High five.
00:58:36.513,00:58:38.806,-Pfft. Higher five. -Oh.
00:58:54.781,00:58:58.368,"Other than a few scratches, he's fine, but we're not on speaking terms at the moment."
00:58:58.743,00:59:01.496,-Is this your first fight ever? -I think so.
00:59:01.579,00:59:04.290,He didn't even start the day off with one of his cheesy pickup lines.
00:59:07.752,00:59:10.171,Nothing. He made his choice.
00:59:10.255,00:59:12.131,You don't need him. There'll be more.
00:59:12.590,00:59:16.928,"Yeah, well, me not getting the guy was always how this was supposed to end."
00:59:21.808,00:59:22.934,Forget about them.
00:59:23.017,00:59:24.060,Let's go dance.
00:59:24.811,00:59:25.645,Jodi.
00:59:26.229,00:59:27.730,Get in here.
00:59:27.814,00:59:28.731,Pass.
00:59:28.815,00:59:32.610,Not dancing to your high school marching band before homecoming is bad juju.
00:59:33.111,00:59:34.153,I'll risk it.
01:00:01.014,01:00:01.931,We need to talk.
01:00:03.099,01:00:03.975,About what?
01:00:04.058,01:00:04.934,About a guy.
01:00:05.310,01:00:07.770,"It's come to my attention, is very into you."
01:00:07.854,01:00:10.189,"-Look, I did not mean for anything-- -Schnipper."
01:00:11.858,01:00:12.692,Schnipper?
01:00:13.860,01:00:14.819,He digs your new look.
01:00:15.236,01:00:18.156,"We're all going to the escape room on Friday, and you should come."
01:00:18.239,01:00:20.283,"Okay, I'm not falling for another one of your tricks."
01:00:20.366,01:00:23.202,It's not a trick. He told me to come over and invite you.
01:00:23.786,01:00:25.288,And why should I believe you?
01:00:25.371,01:00:30.126,"'Cause I know I haven't always been the nicest to you, but consider this my way of making it up to you."
01:00:39.552,01:00:41.763,She just invited me to hang out Friday night.
01:00:42.221,01:00:44.891,-Why? -Because apparently Schnipper likes me.
01:00:45.141,01:00:47.518,-They're messing with you again. -Yeah. That's what I thought.
01:00:48.311,01:00:50.229,But she sounded kind of genuine.
01:00:50.605,01:00:51.939,"Oh, you're dreaming."
01:00:52.273,01:00:54.901,Is it really that hard to believe that Schnipper would like me?
01:00:54.984,01:00:55.943,Yes.
01:00:56.152,01:00:58.321,All the guy does is make fun of you.
01:00:58.404,01:01:01.783,"And even if it were true, why would you wanna go out with Schnipper?"
01:01:02.116,01:01:06.663,"Maybe if Stig saw that I moved on, he would realize that he made a mistake."
01:01:06.746,01:01:09.165,"Okay, but we have tickets to Tank and the Bangas on Friday."
01:01:09.540,01:01:11.626,And I'm sure you can find someone else to go with.
01:01:12.627,01:01:14.879,"Wow, so now you're flaking on me?"
01:01:15.546,01:01:18.132,Why are you giving me such a hard time about this?
01:01:18.216,01:01:22.845,"Why are you acting so crazy over a guy who, you just admitted two minutes ago, was never going to happen?"
01:01:23.179,01:01:25.139,Do you really need validation that badly?
01:01:25.223,01:01:29.602,"If you're not going to have my back, I would really just prefer you keep your opinions to yourself."
01:01:33.564,01:01:35.608,"Don't worry, I will."
01:01:58.005,01:02:02.635,Welcome to Maison Voodoo.
01:02:04.512,01:02:11.519,It was there where me and my entire clan were murdered just last night.
01:02:12.478,01:02:18.234,"Now, you have exactly one hour-- To hunt for clues, find the killer, meet the same fate, blah, blah, blah."
01:02:18.317,01:02:19.944,It's not our first rodeo. Just let us in.
01:02:22.739,01:02:24.615,Whatever. I get paid either way.
01:02:24.699,01:02:26.117,"Uh, wait right there."
01:02:39.547,01:02:45.511,"I mean, well, my mom's going out of town on a yoga retreat that weekend, so I guess I can have a little get-together at mine."
01:02:45.595,01:02:46.512,-Are you serious? -Yeah.
01:02:46.596,01:02:47.764,That's perfect.
01:02:47.847,01:02:49.056,Party at Dunkleman's!
01:02:49.140,01:02:50.224,"No, no, get-together."
01:02:50.308,01:02:53.102,-Party! -Get-together!
01:02:53.186,01:02:55.396,"-Get-together. -Party, party, party! Party."
01:02:56.022,01:02:57.899,"Get-together. I said... You guys heard me, right?"
01:02:59.901,01:03:00.860,-It's a party. -Get...
01:03:00.943,01:03:02.028,-Hello? -Mm-hm.
01:03:06.365,01:03:08.367,"Oh. Uh, okay. All right."
01:03:09.827,01:03:11.496,First clue's in the parlor upstairs.
01:03:11.913,01:03:13.915,"Stiggy. Stiggy, come on."
01:03:16.918,01:03:20.254,"So, since when do you throw parties or get-togethers?"
01:03:20.630,01:03:24.383,"Well, I'm hanging out with a pretty popular crew now, so it's sort of expected of me."
01:03:24.467,01:03:26.636,"-Wow, good for you. -Thank you."
01:04:03.923,01:04:05.091,"Guys, I'm tired."
01:04:05.716,01:04:06.551,Let's take a break.
01:04:09.554,01:04:13.182,Plus we have this whole room to ourselves. Might as well take advantage of it.
01:04:25.236,01:04:26.112,Hey.
01:04:57.059,01:04:58.185,"Okay, yeah."
01:04:58.519,01:04:59.395,I can't do this.
01:04:59.478,01:05:01.522,Why not? You guys make such a cute couple.
01:05:03.858,01:05:05.443,"Okay, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go."
01:05:21.709,01:05:22.877,Neither is that.
01:06:08.422,01:06:09.340,Thanks for meeting me.
01:06:09.632,01:06:10.466,Sure.
01:06:10.633,01:06:13.344,What was so important you needed to meet in private?
01:06:13.761,01:06:17.723,"Well, you know that whole plan we had about, Let's forget we kissed?"
01:06:18.265,01:06:19.100,Yeah.
01:06:19.767,01:06:20.851,I hate that plan.
01:06:21.477,01:06:23.854,It's a really terrible plan that we made.
01:06:24.188,01:06:25.147,"I, uh..."
01:06:25.398,01:06:30.111,"I mean, it means I have to see you kissing Schnipper-- Which is never gonna happen again."
01:06:30.194,01:06:32.405,-Thank God. -I honestly did that to make you jealous.
01:06:32.697,01:06:33.948,"Well, that worked."
01:06:37.118,01:06:38.160,"Look, Jodi, I..."
01:06:38.911,01:06:41.580,I'll end it with Kimmy if it means I can be with you.
01:06:42.957,01:06:45.501,"I was thinking I would do it tonight, and, um..."
01:06:45.960,01:06:47.712,maybe we could meet up after?
01:06:49.463,01:06:51.549,"I, uh, I-- I can't tonight."
01:06:52.133,01:06:53.676,It's my sister's pageant.
01:06:54.510,01:06:55.511,Right.
01:06:56.095,01:06:58.889,"I mean, unless you want to be my plus-one."
01:06:59.557,01:07:00.933,"You mean, like, a date?"
01:07:02.226,01:07:03.936,"Yeah, like a date."
01:07:07.106,01:07:09.316,And then we could go to Dunker's party together.
01:07:09.859,01:07:10.901,But on one condition.
01:07:11.485,01:07:15.364,You be my date for Homecoming?
01:07:16.532,01:07:18.159,"Yes, of course."
01:07:22.121,01:07:26.542,"So, Stig is coming with you tonight, -and he asked you to Homecoming? -That's right."
01:07:26.625,01:07:30.212,"Okay, this is all possible because he's breaking up with Kimmy to be with you?"
01:07:30.838,01:07:33.007,"Which I feel bad about, but..."
01:07:33.632,01:07:35.259,"yeah, he is."
01:07:37.928,01:07:39.013,What-- What's wrong?
01:07:39.680,01:07:42.725,Nothing. Nothing's-- Nothing's wrong. Um...
01:07:43.642,01:07:44.935,"Y-- You know, it was just..."
01:07:45.561,01:07:46.729,I don't know. It was...
01:07:47.146,01:07:49.356,It was nice when you needed me for something.
01:07:49.899,01:07:52.651,We'll probably just go back to you never needing me for anything again.
01:07:53.694,01:07:54.570,What do you mean?
01:07:55.237,01:07:58.991,"Well, up until last month, you've never really needed my help for anything."
01:07:59.241,01:08:03.412,"Well, I-- I wanted to, you know, talk to you about stuff, but..."
01:08:04.163,01:08:05.206,Why didn't you?
01:08:06.207,01:08:12.880,"I don't know, just because you were just busy with all your pageants, and I just figured that you weren't interested."
01:08:15.758,01:08:19.220,You mean more to me than any stupid crown.
01:08:20.930,01:08:24.225,"Then I guess I will come to you about stuff, then."
01:08:25.726,01:08:26.644,Okay.
01:08:27.853,01:08:28.854,Okay.
01:08:29.563,01:08:30.439,Yeah.
01:08:31.107,01:08:32.942,"I mean, who else would I talk to?"
01:08:34.151,01:08:36.070,You're my... You're my big sister.
01:08:38.656,01:08:40.282,You're my big little sister.
01:08:41.617,01:08:42.743,That's me.
01:08:57.800,01:08:58.968,"So, where is he?"
01:09:00.094,01:09:01.846,"Late, obviously."
01:09:01.929,01:09:04.348,"-But he's definitely coming? -Yes, he's coming."
01:09:04.598,01:09:07.768,"Okay, sorry. We're just so excited to meet him."
01:09:08.185,01:09:09.812,"Okay, please don't embarrass me."
01:09:10.646,01:09:11.522,Never.
01:09:11.897,01:09:12.773,Yeah.
01:09:15.943,01:09:17.653,I'm so going to embarrass her.
01:09:17.736,01:09:18.737,"Me, too!"
01:09:21.657,01:09:24.910,"Ladies and Gentleman, your Teen Miss Louisiana contestants!"
01:10:43.030,01:10:44.740,Miss Harper Kreyman everyone!
01:10:51.121,01:10:57.628,"I guess the one way that I would work to make the world a better place is by using my hotel management skills, which..."
01:11:07.930,01:11:13.060,...which is all about meeting and exceeding guest expectations.
01:11:13.143,01:11:19.066,"Now, wouldn't it be great if we could meet and exceed guest expectations..."
01:11:32.037,01:11:33.247,Thank you so much.
01:11:49.763,01:11:52.224,"In your face, Miss Teen Shreveport!"
01:11:59.064,01:12:01.191,I'm gonna kill that kid when I see him.
01:12:02.651,01:12:04.862,I'm serious. I'm gonna run over Stig with the car.
01:12:04.945,01:12:06.322,"Okay, then you'll go to jail."
01:12:09.074,01:12:12.077,"no one stands up my daughter, you hear me? No one stands up my daughter!"
01:12:21.754,01:12:22.796,Nobody!
01:13:10.135,01:13:11.011,Jodi.
01:13:12.054,01:13:14.932,"Ah, Jodi, I'm-- I'm sorry. Can I explain, please?"
01:13:15.015,01:13:16.266,"Please, yeah, explain."
01:13:16.350,01:13:22.815,"I had to help Dunkers with the party all day, and then people started showing up early, and, I don't know, it got crazy."
01:13:22.898,01:13:25.734,"And honestly, I lost track of time. I'm sorry."
01:13:27.319,01:13:30.781,"Okay, so, did you talk to Kimmy?"
01:13:31.865,01:13:39.415,"I was going to, I was, but then she kept getting pulled into conversations, and I wanted, like, a quiet moment to do it, -you know? So I just-- -Stig, Stig, quick selfie, dude."
01:13:39.498,01:13:41.667,"Yeah. All right, yeah."
01:13:42.000,01:13:43.544,"-Nice! Yes! Love you, bro. -Does it work?"
01:13:43.627,01:13:45.087,"All right. Yeah, you too, man!"
01:13:48.757,01:13:49.633,What?
01:13:49.716,01:13:51.468,You're not breaking up with Kimmy.
01:13:52.052,01:13:53.345,You never were.
01:13:53.429,01:13:54.638,"Jodi, why would you say that?"
01:13:54.721,01:13:56.849,Because you like being the popular guy.
01:13:59.226,01:14:02.229,"Much more than you like me, so..."
01:14:02.312,01:14:04.148,No. Jodi.
01:14:04.231,01:14:05.607,"Hey, come on. Come back."
01:14:05.691,01:14:07.776,"Stig, over here, man. You gotta check this out."
01:14:16.160,01:14:17.870,Do you... Do you have a date yet?
01:14:18.829,01:14:19.830,I do not.
01:14:21.039,01:14:22.416,Do you want to go with me?
01:14:23.417,01:14:24.668,"I do, yeah."
01:14:28.922,01:14:29.965,And I don't.
01:14:31.717,01:14:32.759,I do and I don't.
01:14:33.093,01:14:35.262,I'm confused. I thought you liked me.
01:14:35.345,01:14:37.431,"I do, I do. I'm just, uh..."
01:14:39.016,01:14:40.142,sorta in love...
01:14:41.435,01:14:42.561,with somebody else.
01:14:44.521,01:14:45.397,I know.
01:14:47.024,01:14:48.775,-What? -Yeah.
01:14:49.067,01:14:50.986,I see the way that you look at Jodi.
01:14:52.821,01:14:55.491,So why aren't you guys together?
01:14:57.784,01:15:00.996,"Um, I don't-- I don't know. I guess I'm just not her type."
01:15:01.079,01:15:04.791,So you're gonna spend the rest of your life waiting until you are her type?
01:15:05.834,01:15:08.962,"If that's what it takes, then, yeah."
01:15:10.756,01:15:11.673,Okay.
01:15:13.217,01:15:15.010,I'm sorry. I know you must hate me.
01:15:15.511,01:15:16.512,I'm bummed.
01:15:17.304,01:15:18.722,But I don't hate you.
01:15:21.433,01:15:23.143,"Your art, though, that, I hate."
01:15:35.489,01:15:37.074,...fluctuates in this part of the boat.
01:15:37.157,01:15:43.580,"They can grow or decline based on tiny changes in current, temperature or even water temperature."
01:15:43.664,01:16:14.945,Only time will tell if these new efforts-- Jodi?
01:16:15.654,01:16:16.655,You okay?
01:16:22.202,01:16:23.745,Don't worry. I'm not gonna...
01:16:24.538,01:16:26.707,say anything or do anything to upset you.
01:16:26.790,01:16:27.874,"I just, uh..."
01:16:32.045,01:16:33.839,just wanna tell you I love you.
01:16:40.137,01:16:41.138,"And, uh..."
01:16:43.890,01:16:46.059,"I'm here if you need me, okay?"
01:19:25.802,01:19:27.012,What are you doing here?
01:19:29.097,01:19:34.060,"Okay, yeah, come in, not, Touch Jodi's hair -while she's trying to sleep. -Oh, my God."
01:19:36.188,01:19:41.067,My mom. She made me take self-defense classes a few years ago when that serial killer was on the loose.
01:19:41.568,01:19:42.903,"Okay, what are you doing here?"
01:19:43.320,01:19:46.323,-I-- -And-- And what happened to your eye?
01:19:46.406,01:19:54.039,"Last night took a crazy turn, and, um, I-- I took a spill, -Does it hurt? -Not..."
01:19:54.456,01:19:55.999,"Not so much, um..."
01:19:56.917,01:20:03.340,My mom asked me the exact same thing when she came home a day early from her retreat and then grounded me for wrecking the house.
01:20:05.425,01:20:07.093,-So... -Yikes.
01:20:08.053,01:20:09.095,"So, uh..."
01:20:10.055,01:20:11.765,no more Homecoming for me.
01:20:15.644,01:20:16.520,Sorry.
01:20:17.020,01:20:20.899,You have nothing to apologize for.
01:20:23.151,01:20:26.363,I haven't been the best friend recently.
01:20:28.532,01:20:30.659,"And, uh, I am sorry."
01:20:33.912,01:20:35.121,But I got you a present.
01:20:36.164,01:20:37.290,To hopefully...
01:20:39.125,01:20:40.418,try and make up for it.
01:20:40.794,01:20:42.462,So I'm not gonna say anything else.
01:20:42.546,01:20:44.089,-Just open it. -Okay.
01:20:45.549,01:20:46.508,I-- I like the box.
01:20:48.510,01:20:49.427,Open it.
01:20:59.145,01:21:00.355,-High heels. -Mm-hm.
01:21:00.689,01:21:04.693,They're from a specialty drag queen store called Scream Queens.
01:21:04.776,01:21:10.073,"It's this great place, and they gave me a gift card, so if I come in, like, nine more times, I get a free pair."
01:21:11.700,01:21:13.034,"They're, uh, beautiful."
01:21:13.118,01:21:14.077,Thank you.
01:21:14.536,01:21:16.538,But I'm never gonna wear them.
01:21:16.830,01:21:17.664,Okay.
01:21:18.331,01:21:20.917,"Just keep 'em, just in case."
01:21:22.252,01:21:23.169,Why?
01:21:23.879,01:21:26.756,"I am glad you asked that, actually. Let me paint you a picture."
01:21:26.840,01:21:28.508,"-Please don't-- -No, no, no, stick with me here."
01:21:28.842,01:21:30.844,We're three years in the future.
01:21:30.927,01:21:37.017,"You are at some nice college in the Midwest, Northwestern, maybe Notre Dame."
01:21:38.059,01:21:38.977,And...
01:21:40.228,01:21:41.187,you meet some...
01:21:42.188,01:21:44.941,taller-than-you nice guy...
01:21:47.569,01:21:51.740,and he really likes you because of how kind you are.
01:21:53.116,01:21:58.705,And he likes how you sit up front with your Uber drivers 'cause you don't want them to be lonely and...
01:22:00.624,01:22:05.545,"how you hate raisins but love Raisin Bran, which doesn't make any sense to me."
01:22:05.629,01:22:07.547,"But again, maybe he likes it."
01:22:10.592,01:22:12.761,And he asks you out on a date.
01:22:14.846,01:22:16.389,And you wanna wear your heels.
01:22:17.432,01:22:22.270,"And then you try and go out and buy some, and you can't get any 'cause there's a snowstorm outside."
01:22:22.354,01:22:25.106,"So you think back to this moment and you go, Damn."
01:22:26.149,01:22:30.695,I should have kept those heels that Dunkleman gave me just in case.
01:22:41.623,01:22:44.042,It wouldn't work out with the guy. It wouldn't. Yeah.
01:22:44.459,01:22:46.461,"-Right. -But you'd look amazing, so..."
01:22:50.256,01:22:51.174,Thank you.
01:22:53.468,01:22:54.344,"Yeah, no problem."
01:23:38.096,01:23:43.893,"Well, I just wanted to document it just as a reminder in case you ever think about throwing a party again."
01:23:45.937,01:23:48.481,What were you and Jodi talking about in the kitchen earlier?
01:23:48.565,01:23:49.858,Seemed kind of important.
01:23:55.447,01:23:57.907,"Uh, I-- I messed with her."
01:23:57.991,01:24:00.452,"Yeah, Kimmy, I messed with her, and-- and she was pissed at me."
01:24:03.038,01:24:09.961,"Okay, so she came over here the other day, and she was saying that the reason that she left the escape room was because she couldn't stand to see me with, uh, somebody else."
01:24:10.670,01:24:14.007,"So, basically just saying that she's, uh, secretly in love with me."
01:24:16.301,01:24:18.720,"Confessing love? Dude, that's, like, totally lame."
01:24:18.803,01:24:20.555,"Like, I'm definitely not in love with Jodi."
01:24:23.516,01:24:26.561,"so just to get her off my back, I said, Yeah, I'll meet up with you tonight."
01:24:26.644,01:24:29.814,"We can talk more about it. But, uh... But I-- I totally stood her up."
01:24:32.275,01:24:33.485,"Sauvage, bro."
01:24:35.320,01:24:36.321,Dunkers!
01:24:40.825,01:24:42.327,"Sauvage, bro."
01:24:43.578,01:24:44.746,-What're you-- -Dunkers.
01:24:46.206,01:24:47.832,"Dunkers, what's your problem, man?"
01:24:47.916,01:24:49.375,"You are, man, you are."
01:24:49.501,01:24:52.378,"When I met you, you were genuinely a super nice guy, man."
01:24:52.462,01:24:53.963,But you've turned into such a jerk.
01:24:54.047,01:24:59.969,"You're talking trash about Jodi to all these people in public, but when we're in private, man, you're confessing your love for her to me."
01:25:00.345,01:25:03.014,"The crazy thing is you don't even know a thing about her, man."
01:25:03.348,01:25:05.350,"What's her birthday, huh? What's her middle name?"
01:25:05.433,01:25:07.435,"What's her favorite color? What color are her eyes, man?"
01:25:07.852,01:25:09.813,"-Green. -No, they're not, they're blue."
01:25:10.230,01:25:14.275,"I mean, Jodi has so much to offer. She's the best person that I know."
01:25:14.359,01:25:18.738,"I bet you didn't even know she's reading the list of 100 best books before she turns 21, did you know that?"
01:25:18.822,01:25:23.034,"And that's what's so funny, is you think you're so much cooler than her, but you're not."
01:25:23.451,01:25:25.453,"You guys, none of you guys are. You think..."
01:25:25.829,01:25:28.623,She is so much cooler than all of you guys combined.
01:25:28.957,01:25:31.376,"Yeah, well, she's also taller than all of us combined, so..."
01:25:34.170,01:25:35.171,Dunkers!
01:25:35.797,01:25:37.132,"Oh, my God, Dunkers, you okay!"
01:25:38.091,01:25:40.093,"Hey, fellas, come on now, come on!"
01:25:40.677,01:25:42.804,Come on! Take it easy!
01:27:40.296,01:27:47.845,"This is the moment you've all been waiting for, the announcement of your Homecoming King and Queen."
01:27:50.014,01:27:59.857,"And to read the names, please help me welcome to the stage Ruby Bridges alum and recently-crowned Teen Miss Louisiana, Harper Kreyman."
01:28:04.529,01:28:06.656,"Thank you, students. Hello."
01:28:06.739,01:28:09.742,"And Principal Preston, may I just say, you look fantastic."
01:28:09.826,01:28:12.495,Have you lost weight or something? What is it?
01:28:12.745,01:28:13.830,We'll talk later.
01:28:14.163,01:28:17.917,"And now, without further ado, your Homecoming King and Queen."
01:28:22.255,01:28:24.048,And the winner is...
01:28:27.176,01:28:28.052,Um...
01:28:28.845,01:28:29.804,You sure?
01:28:29.887,01:28:31.806,-That's what they told me. -We're sure.
01:28:33.516,01:28:35.518,Kimmy Stitcher and Stig Mohlin.
01:28:45.903,01:28:47.322,Thank you so much!
01:28:52.910,01:28:54.912,"Thank you! Thank you, thank you!"
01:28:55.413,01:28:57.540,Thank you! Who would've ever thought?
01:28:57.623,01:28:59.792,"Everyone, thank you so much! Oh, no?"
01:28:59.876,01:29:02.128,"-Baby, Stig baby, we did it! -Ah!"
01:29:15.433,01:29:16.392,What's wrong?
01:29:17.727,01:29:19.020,I can't do this anymore.
01:29:20.063,01:29:20.980,Do what?
01:29:22.273,01:29:23.316,This.
01:29:26.444,01:29:27.487,Or this.
01:29:28.905,01:29:29.822,Why not?
01:29:31.491,01:29:32.950,Because I made a mistake.
01:29:33.785,01:29:37.830,Because being Ingvar Krueger wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be.
01:29:38.289,01:29:39.540,What's an Ingvar Krueger?
01:29:40.291,01:29:41.376,Doesn't matter.
01:29:43.252,01:29:45.088,"This is because you like Jodi, isn't it?"
01:29:47.673,01:29:50.718,"Can you explain to me, because I don't understand. What do you see in her?"
01:30:34.220,01:30:36.556,"Can I, uh, have everyone's attention, please?"
01:30:40.852,01:30:42.854,"Uh, hi, I am Jodi."
01:30:44.439,01:30:54.031,"You may know me as Amazon or Godzilla or Jodi the Green Giant, or any of those other insults that you've called me in the past years, um..."
01:30:55.158,01:30:56.367,You know what? I-- I get it.
01:30:56.451,01:31:02.039,"I'm-- I'm tall, really, really tall, and it's the thing that's haunted me my entire life."
01:31:02.331,01:31:05.293,"It's, um, it's defined me."
01:31:07.128,01:31:10.756,But I think it's time that I come up with a new definition.
01:31:11.632,01:31:13.134,-And I'd like to say one thing. -Harper.
01:31:13.217,01:31:14.552,"-My moment, not yours. -One thing."
01:31:14.635,01:31:16.429,-Not mine. Okay. -Not yours.
01:31:20.725,01:31:24.270,I'm so much more than just a tall girl.
01:31:25.146,01:31:26.230,I'm a sister.
01:31:32.153,01:31:34.864,"Mostly a good one, sometimes a bad one."
01:31:34.947,01:31:35.907,Sorry.
01:31:36.949,01:31:38.659,I'm smart.
01:31:38.743,01:31:39.785,I'm fun.
01:31:41.329,01:31:43.080,And I've made mistakes.
01:31:43.956,01:31:46.876,I've kissed a guy who I knew had a girlfriend.
01:31:47.418,01:31:48.252,What?
01:31:49.378,01:31:50.463,And I'm sorry.
01:31:52.089,01:31:53.174,That was wrong.
01:31:54.884,01:31:59.430,"And I play piano, and I'm-- I'm really, really good at it."
01:32:00.348,01:32:04.810,"Being tall, actually, is what makes me, me, and I-- I like me."
01:32:04.894,01:32:06.646,And you should like you.
01:32:07.063,01:32:08.564,We're all good enough.
01:32:08.648,01:32:12.318,"And once we realize this, no one can take it away."
01:32:12.818,01:32:15.112,So go ahead and-- and keep making fun of me.
01:32:15.196,01:32:18.324,"Keep calling me names, keep asking me, How's the weather up there? Because..."
01:32:20.034,01:32:21.202,I can take it.
01:32:24.622,01:32:27.291,"Because the weather up here, it's-- it's pretty great."
01:32:58.614,01:33:00.366,Was that how you imagined it?
01:33:01.033,01:33:02.034,Even better.
01:33:07.915,01:33:08.916,I have to go.
01:33:29.145,01:33:30.146,"Jodi, wait!"
01:33:30.688,01:33:31.647,Wait.
01:33:33.482,01:33:36.110,"Oh. Oh, Jodi, I'm so sorry."
01:33:36.611,01:33:38.487,I'm-- I'm so sorry for everything.
01:33:38.779,01:33:41.198,-Thank you. -Your speech was beautiful.
01:33:43.242,01:33:45.411,Thank you for saying that.
01:33:45.745,01:33:46.704,Yeah.
01:33:49.874,01:33:51.208,I broke it off with Kimmy.
01:33:52.001,01:33:52.918,Finally.
01:33:54.503,01:33:59.717,"Look, is there any chance that we can start over?"
01:34:00.009,01:34:00.968,Please?
01:34:04.764,01:34:06.265,I'd love to start over.
01:34:11.646,01:34:14.148,But just not with you.
01:34:46.514,01:34:48.307,-Hey. -Hey.
01:34:54.980,01:34:55.981,Um...
01:34:58.275,01:35:01.570,Why didn't you tell me the real reason you got that black eye?
01:35:04.323,01:35:05.700,It didn't seem important.
01:35:06.492,01:35:07.827,"Okay, but you..."
01:35:08.119,01:35:11.956,"you, like, defended my honor and you took a punch for me."
01:35:12.581,01:35:13.541,"Yeah, well..."
01:35:14.041,01:35:16.168,"-Yeah, well, I guess I-- I did that. -Mm."
01:35:20.798,01:35:21.716,What?
01:35:23.342,01:35:24.301,Nothing.
01:35:26.011,01:35:30.766,I'm just making some mental revisions to my perfect boyfriend checklist.
01:35:32.643,01:35:34.437,"Well, did I make it over 50%?"
01:35:35.438,01:35:36.731,Way over.
01:35:44.280,01:35:49.326,"Uh, to let you know, the only major sticking point is the milk crate."
01:35:52.455,01:35:55.791,put your stuff in a backpack like a normal person.
01:35:56.751,01:36:02.757,"Um, well, because I knew the day would come where I would need it, and I wanted to be ready."
01:36:04.633,01:36:05.801,Ready for what?
01:36:21.859,01:36:22.777,For this.
01:36:33.537,01:36:39.543,"my feet hanging off every bed I've ever slept in, having to sit sideways on airplanes."
01:36:40.044,01:36:43.798,We've all got something about ourselves we wish we could change.
01:36:44.256,01:36:46.884,But it's completely out of our control.
01:36:47.551,01:36:50.679,The only thing that we can control is how we deal with it.
01:36:51.305,01:36:53.682,"And the way I see it, we have two choices."
01:36:54.600,01:36:57.728,"We can lay low, or we can stand tall."
