00:02:32.610,00:02:34.279,You savage son of a bitch.
00:03:19.240,00:03:23.620,We've addressed all past evils and founded a new dynasty to create a new country.
00:03:23.703,00:03:33.254,"1398, 7TH YEAR OF TAEJO Now, the public servants, while receiving state protection, are employing private soldiers for personal protection."
00:03:33.338,00:03:37.467,This is not only unreasonable but also divides our nation's power.
00:03:38.092,00:03:49.562,"Therefore, I request that all soldiers of the officers return to Tri-Armed Forces and gather all private soldiers together… SAMBONG JEONG DO-JEON …and train them in battle formation, Your Majesty."
00:03:49.646,00:03:56.694,"A sudden increase in military activity could anger the emperor of Ming Dynasty. Surely, you know."
00:03:56.778,00:03:59.614,How do you propose we deal with such wrath?
00:03:59.697,00:04:00.990,First Vice-Premier.
00:04:01.074,00:04:05.119,You seem to care more about the Ming than the well-being of Joseon.
00:04:05.203,00:04:09.791,Are you saying that you would rather put this country into chaos of a war?
00:04:09.874,00:04:10.750,Shut your mouth!
00:04:12.460,00:04:13.336,"Everyone, stop!"
00:04:14.128,00:04:16.005,We've only just founded this country.
00:04:16.089,00:04:18.925,How is it that we are arguing already?
00:04:20.593,00:04:21.761,Your Majesty.
00:04:21.844,00:04:26.349,First Admiral Jo Young-gyu and Second Admiral Kim Min-jae have arrived.
00:04:26.432,00:04:28.601,Great! Let them in.
00:04:37.568,00:04:42.240,"I, Jo Young-gyu, have won over the barbarians of the north."
00:04:42.323,00:04:43.866,Welcome back!
00:04:44.826,00:04:46.452,You have worked hard.
00:04:46.536,00:04:48.955,"Kim Min-jae at your service, Your Majesty."
00:04:49.038,00:04:52.375,I hear you made a great contribution during this battle.
00:04:53.084,00:04:56.421,Looking at you reminds me of my younger days.
00:04:56.504,00:04:57.422,It makes me happy.
00:05:02.427,00:05:03.511,First Vice-Premier.
00:05:03.594,00:05:04.762,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:05:04.846,00:05:10.476,I want you to prepare a gift for our victorious admirals.
00:05:10.560,00:05:12.061,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:05:14.772,00:05:17.650,Shoo! Away!
00:05:20.903,00:05:23.865,"Next up, we have this item! We will start at 20."
00:05:23.948,00:05:25.533,-Twenty. -Twenty!
00:05:25.616,00:05:27.827,We have 20. Do we have a 21?
00:05:27.910,00:05:30.288,-Twenty-one! -And we have 21!
00:05:30.371,00:05:31.789,I'm waiting for 22.
00:05:33.082,00:05:36.461,And we have a winner at 22.
00:05:36.544,00:05:37.754,"Oh, that was close."
00:05:44.302,00:05:45.928,"Well, look who this is."
00:05:46.596,00:05:51.100,"If it isn't Admiral Kim Min-jae, who's won a big battle!"
00:05:51.684,00:05:53.644,Have you been well?
00:05:53.728,00:05:56.064,Thanks to you!
00:05:57.523,00:06:00.318,The youngest of the Gang's became the crown prince.
00:06:00.401,00:06:02.445,"Yes, I know."
00:06:03.571,00:06:05.156,Is that why you're here?
00:06:06.282,00:06:07.533,What do you mean?
00:06:08.493,00:06:14.457,Are you here in case I would be sad that I didn't become the crown prince?
00:06:15.792,00:06:18.002,I hear it was your father-in-law's decision.
00:06:18.711,00:06:20.338,No way.
00:06:21.172,00:06:23.883,I believe the crowning of the prince is up to the king.
00:06:23.966,00:06:25.968,I am jealous of your father-in-law.
00:06:26.969,00:06:31.432,What worries would he have with you next to him?
00:06:33.226,00:06:37.188,We'll save the rest of the chat for the party later.
00:06:45.822,00:06:46.656,I'm off.
00:06:58.751,00:07:01.212,Thief! Catch the thief!
00:07:06.634,00:07:07.760,No!
00:07:11.305,00:07:14.976,You would make him handicapped for stealing a trinket?
00:07:15.643,00:07:18.104,He is just a hungry little boy.
00:07:19.564,00:07:27.071,"To you, this means a few meals, but to me, this is a sole gift from my parted mother."
00:07:30.199,00:07:32.201,Use this to get some food first.
00:07:32.910,00:07:36.289,"And promise me you'll never steal again, okay?"
00:07:40.585,00:07:42.920,Everyone has something dear to them.
00:07:56.225,00:07:57.393,I was rude.
00:07:58.853,00:08:00.229,Please forgive my manners.
00:08:09.363,00:08:10.364,Let's go.
00:08:12.366,00:08:14.660,You went to see Prince Jeongan?
00:08:15.661,00:08:16.579,"Yes, sir."
00:08:18.748,00:08:21.417,He's pretending to be a toothless tiger.
00:08:22.251,00:08:23.961,But he can't fool me.
00:08:25.755,00:08:28.174,He's hiding his claws.
00:08:29.550,00:08:33.221,You are familiar with his character.
00:08:34.680,00:08:40.061,It won't be right for you to treat him as a good friend anymore.
00:08:40.144,00:08:41.270,Do you understand?
00:08:43.356,00:08:44.232,I understand.
00:08:45.900,00:08:50.863,You're appointed the chief of the Tri-Armed Forces so prepare accordingly.
00:08:52.240,00:08:53.241,But Father.
00:08:54.534,00:08:57.662,I told you I would rest after this battle was over.
00:08:58.246,00:09:00.748,The state of affairs calls for it.
00:09:01.666,00:09:04.168,The young Crown Prince comes from a different faction.
00:09:04.252,00:09:07.088,The reform of the military brought chaos too.
00:09:08.839,00:09:13.052,We'll use enemies from the outside to bond internally.
00:09:13.135,00:09:15.096,We'll strike the land of Yodong.
00:09:18.057,00:09:21.894,All you need to do is follow the command.
00:09:27.942,00:09:29.485,So has it helped?
00:09:30.069,00:09:33.447,Your medicine helped a lot.
00:09:33.531,00:09:34.740,That's great news.
00:09:34.824,00:09:38.744,You need to get better to start having a child.
00:09:39.954,00:09:41.038,"Oh, Father."
00:09:41.664,00:09:43.624,I'm visiting for a reason.
00:09:44.250,00:09:46.544,I have something for my son-in-law.
00:09:47.503,00:09:49.380,-Bring it in. -Yes.
00:09:54.510,00:09:55.553,Open it.
00:10:06.230,00:10:10.359,"Isn't this… Sambong, do you remember?"
00:10:10.943,00:10:12.069,It's a sachet.
00:10:12.153,00:10:16.532,What a precious gift for my grandson?
00:10:16.616,00:10:22.079,It's a tradition for the father-in-law to hand it down in person so keep it close to you at all times.
00:10:27.543,00:10:29.879,I am grateful beyond words.
00:10:31.422,00:10:36.344,The sachet means I've got hopes for you.
00:10:36.427,00:10:38.179,You do understand?
00:10:43.559,00:10:44.935,Shouldn't you be leaving?
00:10:45.603,00:10:47.897,You shouldn't be late to your party.
00:10:48.773,00:10:50.316,It's fine. Go ahead.
00:10:57.865,00:10:59.742,-I shall get going then. -Okay.
00:11:05.790,00:11:07.124,Take your drinks.
00:11:11.212,00:11:14.173,Let's drink away tonight.
00:11:28.020,00:11:29.563,Is that right?
00:11:29.647,00:11:31.732,"Oh, yes."
00:11:31.816,00:11:33.734,You're here!
00:11:34.235,00:11:35.486,Look here.
00:11:35.569,00:11:38.489,What fun is there without the star of the party?
00:11:38.572,00:11:41.075,I'm sorry. Family business.
00:11:41.158,00:11:43.786,That family of yours is certainly busy.
00:11:43.869,00:11:47.456,Sambong said he couldn't make it either.
00:11:47.540,00:11:50.543,The son-in-law takes after his father-in-law!
00:11:51.127,00:11:55.005,Taking charge of big jobs to take credit for them!
00:11:55.589,00:12:00.052,No wonder they're so busy.
00:12:00.803,00:12:02.555,What did I tell you?
00:12:03.139,00:12:07.435,You need to lose some weight.
00:12:07.935,00:12:08.853,Isn't that right?
00:12:14.316,00:12:15.151,Here.
00:12:15.234,00:12:18.404,-Drink away! -Drink away!
00:12:28.247,00:12:30.374,Her name's Ga-hee.
00:12:31.751,00:12:34.295,She's prepared a dance that is popular in the Ming.
00:12:34.378,00:12:37.631,She practiced with all sincerity for this occasion.
00:14:19.358,00:14:21.735,A dance calls for etiquette and artistry.
00:14:21.819,00:14:24.446,You should know better.
00:14:24.530,00:14:25.906,How rude.
00:14:27.575,00:14:29.660,Today's your death day!
00:14:30.452,00:14:31.871,We've committed a big sin.
00:14:31.954,00:14:35.833,She's still only a virgin. Please forgive her.
00:14:35.916,00:14:36.750,What?
00:14:38.085,00:14:39.169,She's a virgin?
00:14:40.296,00:14:41.130,Great!
00:14:45.050,00:14:47.678,Then I will help you with your first time.
00:14:48.429,00:14:52.892,I'd rather die than to do that.
00:14:52.975,00:14:54.143,You'd rather die?
00:14:55.019,00:14:58.480,I'll fix that attitude of yours today.
00:15:14.413,00:15:15.372,That's enough.
00:15:16.248,00:15:21.420,So you've made some contribution and are in the king's favor.
00:15:21.503,00:15:24.298,Do you think that makes me any less than you?
00:15:28.385,00:15:29.970,I think it's best you stop now.
00:15:32.264,00:15:34.266,"You want to be her first, too?"
00:15:36.852,00:15:38.187,Great.
00:15:39.063,00:15:40.856,Let's see who gets to do it.
00:15:42.107,00:15:44.902,We will fight for it. Draw!
00:15:48.238,00:15:52.660,I know I'm a useless prince who wasn't crowned by the king.
00:15:53.577,00:15:55.955,"But still, I am a prince."
00:15:58.165,00:15:59.833,Aren't you taking it too far?
00:16:01.627,00:16:07.466,"In that case, why don't we let her choose?"
00:16:09.093,00:16:10.678,That's brilliant.
00:16:11.679,00:16:13.847,I came today with a happy heart.
00:16:14.390,00:16:18.268,"But to be treated an invisible man and to see a fight, because of a girl."
00:16:19.436,00:16:23.899,One of you two will need to accept her hand.
00:16:26.026,00:16:28.821,"Oh, is that your choice!"
00:16:29.405,00:16:35.995,Why don't we celebrate those two together?
00:16:37.705,00:16:40.499,Hooray!
00:16:40.582,00:16:42.960,-Hooray! -Hooray!
00:16:46.964,00:16:48.173,This is great!
00:16:53.762,00:16:55.639,What were you thinking?
00:16:56.348,00:16:58.767,I saw that you were bleeding.
00:17:04.064,00:17:06.066,The difficult moment has passed.
00:17:06.900,00:17:07.735,Get some rest.
00:17:12.489,00:17:15.826,"If you leave now, I will not be well received."
00:17:17.327,00:17:18.620,What do you mean?
00:17:19.496,00:17:26.420,Even in this profession a girl who gets left on her first night is considered unlucky and men don't like it.
00:17:55.991,00:18:10.047,LEE JE KIM MIN-JAE'S SUBORDINATE COMMANDER Stop it.
00:18:13.133,00:18:16.428,This should be enough for you not to be considered unlucky.
00:18:21.433,00:18:24.561,I heard you were rough and brutal.
00:18:26.438,00:18:27.898,But there seems to be more.
00:18:28.857,00:18:34.488,"They say you do not fear killing and that for you, killing is easier than eating."
00:18:34.571,00:18:36.323,I just uphold a command.
00:18:38.200,00:18:40.661,How could killing be easy for anybody?
00:18:41.662,00:18:44.540,Why don't you stop the nonsense and get some rest?
00:19:03.559,00:19:05.102,Get him off!
00:19:05.686,00:19:08.647,Mother!
00:19:46.518,00:20:50.540,"If you want true revenge… So if I get the kitten out, you will give me the trinket?"
00:20:50.624,00:20:52.542,"Yes, of course."
00:20:53.043,00:20:55.796,"My hands are too big, you see."
00:20:56.713,00:20:59.424,"You'll hear it crying, stuck in a crack."
00:21:00.425,00:21:01.885,Just you.
00:21:01.969,00:21:03.470,I'll be waiting outside.
00:21:30.414,00:21:32.582,Stay still.
00:21:38.380,00:21:40.549,-You lowly life. -Please don't kill me!
00:21:40.632,00:21:43.802,How dare you!
00:22:30.182,00:22:31.808,Look at this guy!
00:22:34.102,00:22:37.481,The girl from the other day was not a serf.
00:22:37.564,00:22:39.691,The bureau received a case report.
00:22:40.901,00:22:41.735,Damn it.
00:22:41.818,00:22:44.529,You should've been careful to pick out the lowly ones.
00:22:45.113,00:22:47.783,It's not like they wear a sign.
00:22:48.492,00:22:51.536,She looked all shabby like a lowly one.
00:22:54.664,00:22:58.960,We're only trying to take advantage of the country founded by our fathers.
00:22:59.044,00:23:00.420,Unfortunate turn of events.
00:23:00.504,00:23:06.093,"Well that is how it is, so back to the courtesan parlor it is."
00:23:06.676,00:23:13.308,"That's no problem for us, but His Majesty has his stern eyes on his son-in-law here."
00:23:13.392,00:23:15.769,What's he gonna do?
00:23:15.852,00:23:19.022,Damn it! I didn't see this coming.
00:23:19.106,00:23:20.440,What can you do?
00:23:20.524,00:23:23.944,It's what you get for having such a father and a grandfather.
00:23:24.611,00:23:28.740,"Since we are on the topic, did you hear that rumor?"
00:23:28.824,00:23:29.908,What rumor?
00:23:30.742,00:23:36.623,That his father took in a courtesan-in-training for her first night last night.
00:23:36.706,00:23:38.333,It's all over town!
00:23:39.751,00:23:41.002,Is that true?
00:23:41.086,00:23:42.879,I knew it!
00:23:43.797,00:23:46.633,He acts like he wants none of it.
00:23:49.845,00:23:54.599,Men are all the same.
00:23:58.478,00:24:02.065,You know the work it took to build this country.
00:24:02.149,00:24:04.025,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:24:14.911,00:24:16.079,Your Majesty!
00:24:21.668,00:24:28.091,I give you the sword in hopes that you'll now become my other self.
00:24:28.925,00:24:33.847,I need you more than anyone for me and the crown prince.
00:24:35.098,00:24:49.112,I thereby eliminate the system of the Tri-Armed Forces which has been handed down from the previous dynasty and restructure the military to the Righteous Armed Forces… Carry this sword for me.
00:24:49.738,00:24:51.615,Use it to protect the crown prince.
00:24:51.698,00:24:54.493,This is my first request and a royal command to you.
00:24:55.076,00:25:01.541,"As the new chief of the Armed Forces, I hereby appoint Kim Min-jae."
00:25:01.625,00:25:05.670,"I shall uphold your royal command, Your Majesty."
00:25:17.933,00:25:19.809,How could he do this to me?
00:25:19.893,00:25:21.603,I've been a warrior all my life.
00:25:21.686,00:25:24.231,Ministry of Culture and Education?
00:25:24.314,00:25:26.650,This is a major demotion!
00:25:27.567,00:25:29.819,"Yes, that's the way to do it!"
00:25:31.196,00:25:36.243,This country is going into the hands of the Sambong and Kim Min-jae duo!
00:25:37.160,00:25:38.620,"Duo, you say?"
00:25:39.412,00:25:42.916,Kim Min-jae is merely Sambong's dog.
00:25:42.999,00:25:44.209,Woof!
00:25:46.795,00:25:54.135,"So what I'm trying to say is, you did the most work in getting this country up and running."
00:25:54.219,00:25:58.473,"And yet they're the ones in control, with the crowning of the prince and all."
00:25:58.557,00:26:01.226,It makes me so angry!
00:26:02.811,00:26:05.855,"Yes, gotta read ahead!"
00:26:05.939,00:26:07.190,"But, sir!"
00:26:07.899,00:26:12.696,I like this life.
00:26:13.363,00:26:14.864,Sir!
00:26:17.367,00:26:21.413,"I'm gonna get her to serve me today, no matter what."
00:26:22.289,00:26:24.291,Send her in as soon as she's ready.
00:26:25.083,00:26:29.796,She already belongs to someone else and is only available for entertainment.
00:26:29.879,00:26:30.797,Hey!
00:26:31.715,00:26:34.551,Stop talking and do as I say!
00:26:36.136,00:26:38.138,"-Yes, sir. -Damn it."
00:27:09.669,00:27:10.545,Sir.
00:27:11.588,00:27:12.505,Over there.
00:27:13.006,00:27:13.965,What are you doing?
00:27:14.966,00:27:17.093,Get down here now!
00:27:21.181,00:27:25.185,"No matter how lowly I may be, there are rules to be kept."
00:27:25.268,00:27:28.605,Even a courtesan has loyalty to keep.
00:27:30.148,00:27:34.819,"If you will continue to look for me, I will jump off, right now."
00:27:38.281,00:27:40.075,So a lowly girl like you dies.
00:27:40.158,00:27:43.870,Do you think people will think you a woman of virtue?
00:27:44.371,00:27:48.500,It'll be treated no more than a crazy girl who killed herself.
00:27:50.210,00:27:58.426,"If my fate is to sell my smiles in the arms of men like you, I would rather be the crazy girl who kills herself."
00:27:58.510,00:27:59.344,Watch it!
00:28:02.847,00:28:05.475,"Ga-hee, why are you doing this?"
00:28:06.935,00:28:08.019,Don't do this.
00:28:08.812,00:28:10.855,Don't.
00:28:15.610,00:28:16.444,Ga-hee!
00:28:16.945,00:28:17.821,Sir!
00:28:17.904,00:28:19.447,"Sir, no!"
00:28:20.240,00:28:21.491,-Sir! -Sir!
00:28:55.150,00:28:58.486,There's no way to say that this won't happen again.
00:28:59.446,00:29:09.789,Ever since the day you took her in for her first night she's kept this handkerchief with her at all times and refused to be with any other men.
00:29:12.208,00:29:16.337,I will have her leave as soon as she gets better.
00:29:18.965,00:29:20.216,What are you going to do?
00:29:22.135,00:29:25.889,"You don't plan on taking her into your household either, do you?"
00:29:26.973,00:29:32.312,I make my living as the butterflies attract to a flower.
00:29:32.979,00:29:38.026,A flower without a scent does not belong here.
00:29:39.235,00:29:43.406,I'll have to tell her to find another way to live.
00:30:34.123,00:30:42.215,"LADY OF KIM MIN-JAE, JEONG CLAN Are you so naive and pure so as to trust a man?"
00:30:43.174,00:30:46.845,How dare you get in the way of a lord with a dirty lowly body?
00:30:48.555,00:30:50.890,Isn't this what you are after anyway?
00:30:51.850,00:30:56.312,"If you care as much as to not get in his way, I suggest you go far away now."
00:31:05.738,00:31:10.159,I thought hard about what would be in your best interest.
00:31:11.703,00:31:17.208,You have treated me with such generosity… He came from the docks.
00:31:17.292,00:31:21.337,that I have fallen in love with you.
00:31:23.506,00:31:27.969,But I fear I will only become an obstacle in your way.
00:31:28.553,00:31:32.599,So I bid you farewell as I send away my heart in this letter.
00:31:32.682,00:31:35.602,Please take care.
00:31:37.937,00:31:39.731,Lady Ga-hee!
00:31:47.155,00:31:48.573,Sir.
00:34:30.526,00:34:32.653,I was curious about you.
00:34:32.737,00:34:34.655,You are as beautiful as I hear.
00:34:34.739,00:34:36.115,You are too kind.
00:34:36.199,00:34:39.077,You can be comfortable with me. Be my friend.
00:34:40.787,00:34:44.582,I've brought a humble gift for Your Highness.
00:34:48.461,00:34:49.629,It's a great piece.
00:34:50.463,00:34:54.759,I heard you like poetry so I tried a hand with my humble skills.
00:34:56.094,00:35:00.056,It's a bit embarrassing but I'm doing some writing myself.
00:35:01.182,00:35:02.308,What kind of writing?
00:35:03.392,00:35:06.104,This and that about the world.
00:35:07.188,00:35:08.773,I'd love to show you some time.
00:35:09.899,00:35:10.733,Sure.
00:35:11.526,00:35:13.194,Sir Kim Jin enters.
00:35:17.824,00:35:21.160,Is she Father's… That's right.
00:35:26.582,00:35:28.668,Allow me to bow to you.
00:35:28.751,00:35:30.211,I am Ga-hee.
00:35:44.976,00:35:49.772,I saw you were happily chatting earlier-- Do look at this.
00:35:53.192,00:35:55.486,Different are the noble and the lowly.
00:35:55.570,00:35:58.739,"But to each, a purpose. Thus in each way, noble are all."
00:36:05.872,00:36:07.748,I shall leave now.
00:36:18.342,00:36:21.429,What do you think? Isn't it amazing?
00:36:21.512,00:36:22.471,Indeed.
00:36:25.558,00:36:26.601,Absolutely amazing.
00:36:43.701,00:36:47.872,You should be staying low and upright. How dare you bring in a girl!
00:36:48.456,00:36:50.541,Have you forgotten that the king is your in-law?
00:36:51.334,00:36:53.544,Your job is to conquer the north for the crown prince.
00:36:53.628,00:36:55.630,What is this reckless behavior?
00:36:57.089,00:37:00.176,How do you think you would be if I hadn't taken you in then?
00:37:01.052,00:37:06.265,"You would be with the barbarians living like savages, preying on animal carcasses."
00:37:06.766,00:37:10.895,I took you in as my son-in-law even though your mother is a Jurchen.
00:37:10.978,00:37:19.195,"If I hadn't taken your offer, would Jin have been able to marry into the royal family?"
00:37:21.739,00:37:26.369,So you'll tell the world that Jin is not your real son?
00:37:28.996,00:37:32.875,Are you trying to mock me using my daughter's weakness?
00:37:33.459,00:37:39.090,"If I thought I'd break your promise, I wouldn't have taken the offer at all."
00:37:58.776,00:38:00.736,What is this rude behavior?
00:38:01.779,00:38:03.322,Please leave at once.
00:38:07.285,00:38:11.622,I had no idea that my father's concubine was you.
00:38:13.582,00:38:17.753,I thought you were dead.
00:38:18.838,00:38:20.381,Nearly dead.
00:38:21.257,00:38:27.388,But a lowly life can live or die at will.
00:38:32.268,00:38:41.360,Why did you disappear then? I… I looked so hard for you.
00:38:42.945,00:38:45.156,Did you really look for me?
00:38:45.781,00:38:47.783,"Yes, of course."
00:38:50.286,00:38:53.748,I'm so happy that you're near me again.
00:38:53.831,00:38:58.044,"Though I may be a concubine, I am your father's woman now."
00:38:58.627,00:39:00.504,Would you go so far as to commit a deadly crime?
00:39:00.588,00:39:02.131,You should leave.
00:39:04.759,00:39:07.219,"Lady, Her Highness is looking for you."
00:39:27.531,00:39:30.659,Did you read it? How is it?
00:39:31.369,00:39:32.411,It's fun.
00:39:33.287,00:39:39.293,The love between a nobleman and the courtesan in his hometown was sad but beautiful.
00:39:41.295,00:39:42.338,That's good to hear.
00:39:43.089,00:39:44.131,Any other feedback?
00:39:44.715,00:39:49.929,"This story reminds me-- My lady, are you in-- Uh-oh."
00:39:54.266,00:39:58.604,I must be interrupting your conversation.
00:39:58.687,00:40:01.148,Not at all. Please come in.
00:40:03.484,00:40:04.485,Okay.
00:40:04.568,00:40:06.362,Keep going.
00:40:07.196,00:40:13.577,"When I was in the courtesan parlor, I've heard a similar story from the silk merchant."
00:40:13.661,00:40:14.662,Is that right?
00:40:14.745,00:40:15.746,Yes.
00:40:15.830,00:40:20.459,But unlike the story you've written-- How is it different?
00:40:20.543,00:40:21.460,Do tell me.
00:40:22.211,00:40:31.804,"In that story, the nobleman, on his way back from his hometown, thinks the courtesan would get in the way of his career and kills her before he leaves."
00:40:31.887,00:40:33.389,"Oh, poor thing."
00:40:34.181,00:40:36.851,Does the story really end in vain?
00:40:36.934,00:40:42.982,"As it turns out, the courtesan makes it back alive and decides to take revenge."
00:40:43.858,00:40:46.610,"Oh, how so?"
00:40:46.694,00:40:51.365,"Well, I haven't heard the rest."
00:40:51.449,00:40:53.325,He said he'd tell it next time.
00:40:53.409,00:40:56.537,"I know it's just a story, but how heartbreaking."
00:40:57.163,00:40:59.206,It couldn't possibly be true.
00:40:59.290,00:41:01.292,Who could be so evil?
00:41:01.375,00:41:04.128,"Sure, it must be a made up story."
00:41:04.211,00:41:08.132,"When the merchant returns, hear the rest and tell me about it."
00:41:08.215,00:41:09.633,"Yes, I will."
00:41:11.594,00:41:14.555,The dead girl came back alive?
00:41:15.139,00:41:16.640,Does that make any sense?
00:41:16.724,00:41:18.100,Hold on.
00:41:18.809,00:41:27.651,So you killed a girl to shush her and she came back as your father's concubine.
00:41:27.735,00:41:33.199,I knew something was bound to happen when you kept going for a specific girl.
00:41:39.246,00:41:40.581,Damn it.
00:41:41.957,00:41:44.335,I was blinded by the beauty of that lowly thing.
00:41:45.878,00:41:49.340,"If I were you, I would be scared to death."
00:41:50.549,00:41:52.301,Shouldn't you let your mother know?
00:41:54.303,00:41:56.013,Nah.
00:41:56.680,00:41:58.307,"This time, I shush her for good."
00:43:48.626,00:43:50.336,-What's this? -Danger. Stay still!
00:44:21.575,00:44:22.785,Who is it?
00:44:22.868,00:44:24.662,Who asked you to do this?
00:44:28.791,00:44:30.376,"My lord, no!"
00:44:32.586,00:44:33.504,Ga-hee!
00:44:34.755,00:44:35.589,Ga-hee!
00:44:43.138,00:44:44.473,Call a doctor!
00:44:44.556,00:44:45.683,"-Yes, sir. -Lady."
00:44:45.766,00:44:47.768,"Hurry, now."
00:44:47.851,00:44:48.977,Lady.
00:44:58.737,00:45:01.532,An assassin where the princess lives?
00:45:02.032,00:45:05.452,Who would do that to the house of the chief?
00:45:05.536,00:45:19.133,"While it would be right to find out who did this and punish him, the chief whose job is to eliminate private soldiers, his own servants were found fighting with knives."
00:45:19.216,00:45:22.344,This must be looked into.
00:45:22.428,00:45:25.514,They were only doing so to save their master from danger.
00:45:25.597,00:45:27.766,How is that the same as private soldiers?
00:45:27.850,00:45:31.437,"The chief, your son-in-law, and the princess were in danger."
00:45:32.855,00:45:35.274,We need to find out who's behind this first.
00:45:35.357,00:45:37.484,The assassins are all dead.
00:45:37.568,00:45:42.531,How do you propose to investigate and punish the dead?
00:45:42.614,00:45:46.201,"What else do you call a servant with a knife, if not a private soldier?"
00:45:46.285,00:45:51.540,It would be best for the chief to send the people to the Armed Forces.
00:45:52.624,00:45:55.127,It's all my fault.
00:45:56.170,00:46:02.092,I will send the relevant servants to the Armed Forces so that this is no longer a problem.
00:46:02.676,00:46:05.929,That concludes this case then.
00:46:06.013,00:46:11.310,Let it be known to all that I'll punish anyone who mentions this again!
00:46:24.907,00:46:27.618,-Catch it! -Catch it!
00:46:44.468,00:46:46.470,"Hello, Chief."
00:46:46.553,00:46:49.598,You grace us with your presence today.
00:46:49.681,00:46:52.684,I thought we might shoot together. It's been a while.
00:46:52.768,00:46:55.854,I'd be happy to. You're always welcome.
00:46:56.814,00:46:57.815,Here!
00:48:04.590,00:48:06.508,You've still got it.
00:48:06.592,00:48:09.219,Everyone was skillful and agile.
00:48:09.303,00:48:10.762,I got lucky.
00:48:10.846,00:48:15.934,"We do nothing but hunt all day, so agility comes naturally."
00:48:17.227,00:48:21.023,Were you the one who sent me the guests?
00:48:21.648,00:48:25.193,I'm very disappointed.
00:48:25.277,00:48:28.989,Why do you keep collecting private soldiers this way?
00:48:29.072,00:48:35.787,I'm just having fun catching animals with those layabouts.
00:48:35.871,00:48:38.582,Then help me recruit them to the Armed Forces.
00:48:40.918,00:48:44.796,Why the big-scale military training at times like this?
00:48:45.964,00:48:49.843,It's only natural to gather nation's forces under one roof.
00:48:53.305,00:48:55.223,Are you telling me you're striking Yodong?
00:48:55.307,00:48:59.061,Perhaps you're after the throne with the crown prince as the shield?
00:48:59.645,00:49:02.022,You take it too far.
00:49:02.105,00:49:07.486,I guess you wouldn't know either way.
00:49:08.904,00:49:12.449,You're just doing the dirty work for Sambong.
00:49:12.532,00:49:16.954,Private soldiers break up the national power-- My dear Min-jae.
00:49:20.415,00:49:21.833,"Look here, Kim Min-jae."
00:49:24.419,00:49:27.631,I want to know your thoughts. Not Sambong's.
00:49:28.799,00:49:34.972,Is this man sitting in front of me Kim Min-jae or Sambong?
00:49:39.184,00:49:42.396,Is it good to be Sambong's sycophant?
00:49:43.063,00:49:45.440,I do not belong to anyone.
00:49:47.567,00:49:51.488,I only serve the king and protect the people with my sword.
00:49:55.409,00:49:57.536,I hope that's the truth.
00:50:03.583,00:50:05.168,Does that make you so happy?
00:50:05.252,00:50:06.086,Yes!
00:50:07.254,00:50:12.801,I'm beyond happy! I didn't know everyone would help out like that.
00:50:14.928,00:50:21.768,Ha Ryun said How do you propose to investigate and punish the dead?
00:50:24.730,00:50:31.403,"But when a dog dies, who clears the dog bowl?"
00:50:31.486,00:50:40.495,That would be the dog owner-- Did you think letting loose a few dogs to kill one fierce dog would be the end-all?
00:50:55.510,00:51:06.855,"If you had the king's neck on the line, would you be able to take the drink where you're seated right now?"
00:51:08.065,00:51:11.860,To think that your well-being rests with the life of a crazy girl.
00:51:12.611,00:51:13.862,How interesting.
00:51:22.412,00:51:24.623,"To all things, an irony."
00:51:25.999,00:51:29.920,This will make the next step easier.
00:51:31.755,00:51:33.757,Do you know who Kim Min-jae's mother is?
00:51:35.550,00:51:36.968,She was a Jurchen courtesan.
00:51:38.261,00:51:41.807,Men are bound to miss the arms of their mothers.
00:51:42.682,00:51:46.394,"Sir, there's a rat spying on us."
00:51:47.437,00:51:48.438,I'm aware.
00:52:06.748,00:52:12.129,You really take after your father's shooting skills!
00:52:13.839,00:52:17.926,I think it's almost time for the peonies to bloom.
00:52:30.605,00:52:35.652,"Lady, the silk merchant is here to see you at the linen shop."
00:52:39.072,00:52:41.074,-Wait here. -Yes.
00:52:55.672,00:52:56.590,Are you there?
00:53:01.845,00:53:02.888,Are you there?
00:53:15.150,00:53:17.652,What brings you here?
00:53:30.916,00:53:36.421,Thought we should continue our conversation from before.
00:53:47.307,00:53:51.228,Is this the kind of conversation you were looking for?
00:53:53.730,00:53:54.731,That's right.
00:53:56.775,00:53:58.777,Now we are talking.
00:53:58.860,00:54:04.616,Do you know that the deadly crime is punishable by beheading?
00:54:05.200,00:54:06.701,"Oh yes, I do know."
00:54:07.202,00:54:12.791,"The one who initiated and the involved, both."
00:54:14.709,00:54:24.469,You and I can work out a story so we may both live.
00:54:37.524,00:54:40.652,You won't be able to get out like last time.
00:54:40.735,00:54:42.362,No one to come looking for you.
00:54:43.697,00:54:44.531,A merchant?
00:54:45.615,00:54:48.159,I made that up to get you here.
00:54:54.207,00:54:57.085,A merchant? What merchant?
00:54:58.962,00:55:02.549,Did you really think that was a true story?
00:55:06.803,00:55:07.804,What do you mean?
00:55:08.388,00:55:14.185,I made it up to entertain the poor princess.
00:55:17.188,00:55:22.235,"If we're going to have fun, we need an excuse."
00:55:22.819,00:55:25.322,"Yes, you're right."
00:55:26.281,00:55:34.497,"Before you take what you want, shouldn't I get something in return?"
00:55:36.166,00:55:38.918,"Yes, anything."
00:55:39.961,00:55:41.129,I'll give you anything.
00:55:44.966,00:55:47.761,I want this as a token of your affection.
00:55:49.471,00:55:59.522,This is from His Majesty-- We're both putting our lives on the line here.
00:56:01.941,00:56:04.569,Doesn't that warrant an appropriate price?
00:56:15.914,00:56:19.167,"Okay, fine."
00:57:07.590,00:57:08.967,What are you doing?
00:57:09.843,00:57:13.388,"I'm sorry, sir. I've made a mistake."
00:57:14.931,00:57:15.932,You dare laugh?
00:57:17.434,00:57:20.812,"What? No way, sir."
00:57:23.940,00:57:24.858,You laughed?
00:57:27.444,00:57:31.364,You laughed? Huh?
00:57:31.865,00:57:32.824,What are you doing?
00:57:38.204,00:57:41.541,He put dirt on my shoes and started laughing.
00:57:41.624,00:57:45.712,"Sir, it's my fault."
00:57:45.795,00:57:48.465,You heard him. I didn't do anything wrong.
00:57:49.591,00:57:53.386,He looked after you ever since you were a tiny baby.
00:57:54.471,00:57:55.305,Come with me.
00:57:59.559,00:58:00.393,Father.
00:58:09.736,00:58:10.945,Come again!
00:58:12.614,00:58:15.200,Give me this one. I'll take this today.
00:58:35.720,00:58:36.554,Get up.
00:58:41.559,00:58:42.477,Block me.
00:58:51.653,00:58:52.862,Get up now!
00:58:54.113,00:58:56.699,"Father, this is all my fault."
00:58:56.783,00:58:58.701,Please step aside. I'm teaching my son a lesson.
00:58:58.785,00:59:01.996,It is my fault for not taking better care of him.
00:59:02.080,00:59:03.748,Punish me.
00:59:03.831,00:59:05.583,This is none of your business.
00:59:05.667,00:59:07.293,What is going on?
00:59:13.132,00:59:17.011,My lord. He's the king's son-in-law before he is your son.
00:59:17.762,00:59:21.099,Aren't you ashamed that the servants are watching?
00:59:21.182,00:59:27.605,"You always cover for him, so he's rude to his people, doesn't know how to use a sword, and always hangs out with hooligans!"
00:59:28.565,00:59:32.777,I never wanted to be the king's in-law. Now I can't even get a job!
00:59:35.029,00:59:36.406,My lord!
00:59:44.539,00:59:46.791,Do you treat him so because he's not your son?
00:59:46.874,00:59:48.751,Is that what you really think?
00:59:48.835,00:59:53.673,"If that's not true, there's no reason you should be so mad."
00:59:53.756,00:59:57.302,I have never thought of Jin as not mine.
00:59:58.303,01:00:00.680,That you would think so is the bigger problem.
01:00:00.763,01:00:02.974,I haven't said much out of shame.
01:00:03.725,01:00:08.396,But how funny you should say that with a whore wrapped around you.
01:00:09.063,01:00:12.358,"I can let everything else go, but don't you dare touch my son!"
01:00:16.362,01:00:21.284,Did you really forget who got you this far?
01:00:26.247,01:00:31.127,Might I ask who that was really for?
01:00:46.643,01:00:51.314,"Your Highness, it's Ga-hee. May I come in?"
01:00:52.774,01:00:53.900,Come in.
01:01:03.284,01:01:05.411,I was worried about you.
01:01:05.495,01:01:08.831,I'm here to listen.
01:01:10.500,01:01:11.334,It's okay.
01:01:12.919,01:01:14.796,I have nothing to say.
01:01:19.217,01:01:22.804,I would appreciate it if you could forget about today.
01:01:23.805,01:01:24.764,I understand.
01:01:26.265,01:01:29.936,"Since you are here, stay and chat with me."
01:01:31.854,01:01:33.189,Did you meet the merchant?
01:01:33.272,01:01:37.068,"Yes, I heard the rest of the story."
01:01:37.902,01:01:40.279,So what happens to the courtesan?
01:01:44.742,01:01:48.454,"When the man's mother found out, she pulled some strings to clear his name."
01:01:50.748,01:01:52.583,Please let us in!
01:01:53.960,01:01:56.504,-The courtesan's mother pleaded. -Please!
01:01:56.587,01:01:58.214,-But she got hurt instead. -No!
01:01:58.297,01:02:00.133,Mother!
01:02:00.967,01:02:01.884,Mother.
01:02:07.056,01:02:12.979,The hired man mistook the courtesan for her mother.
01:02:18.192,01:02:21.195,-Oh no! -Fire!
01:02:32.498,01:02:34.792,How could he have mistaken?
01:02:37.336,01:02:39.338,It was fated so.
01:02:39.422,01:02:41.924,The mother died in her daughter's place.
01:02:44.552,01:02:48.723,"If you were the author, how would you finish the story?"
01:02:51.392,01:02:57.940,It's such a sad story that I can't think of anything right now.
01:03:04.071,01:03:05.448,"Fail, again."
01:03:05.531,01:03:08.993,I want to be good at shooting just like you.
01:03:12.288,01:03:17.210,"If you're anything like the king, you'll get better soon."
01:03:18.127,01:03:20.880,His Majesty enters!
01:03:20.963,01:03:21.964,Father!
01:03:33.684,01:03:36.354,I told you not to come until I called you.
01:03:37.063,01:03:38.898,What's the reason?
01:03:40.691,01:03:50.243,"You got my hands bloody when you needed me and when things were through, you didn't need the bloody one anymore."
01:03:50.326,01:03:51.410,How dare you!
01:03:56.207,01:03:58.835,"Please do not be angry, Your Majesty."
01:04:00.044,01:04:04.799,You're scaring the crown prince.
01:04:19.313,01:04:20.273,My dear Min-jae.
01:04:22.233,01:04:23.442,"Look here, Kim Min-jae."
01:04:24.652,01:04:27.738,Is it good to be Sambong's sycophant?
01:04:27.822,01:04:32.493,Did you really forget who got you this far?
01:04:48.050,01:04:50.094,You look distressed.
01:04:52.263,01:04:55.349,Is there something that you can't get off your chest?
01:04:56.642,01:04:57.518,No.
01:04:58.603,01:05:01.772,I was just thinking about some things in the past.
01:05:03.441,01:05:07.987,"Come to think of it, you've been with me for a while."
01:05:09.196,01:05:11.449,Did you inform your mother?
01:05:14.994,01:05:21.000,"Well-- If you lost touch, I'll help you find her."
01:05:22.501,01:05:25.254,"If I send off some guys, we can find her quickly."
01:05:28.132,01:05:31.052,We can't find her.
01:05:35.681,01:05:38.476,Did you sprinkle her remains in that river?
01:05:39.769,01:05:40.603,Yes.
01:05:50.696,01:06:10.174,"Sir, you don't have to-- Why didn't you tell me?"
01:06:11.425,01:06:13.302,It's too heartbreaking for me.
01:06:14.428,01:06:16.639,I couldn't bear to tell you.
01:06:18.849,01:06:20.518,I'm sorry.
01:06:24.188,01:06:25.022,It's okay.
01:06:26.524,01:06:27.358,Yes.
01:06:28.359,01:06:30.361,I'll protect you.
01:06:31.988,01:06:34.240,No matter what.
01:06:35.950,01:06:38.452,I will protect you no matter what comes our way.
01:07:09.358,01:07:10.568,Stop it!
01:07:11.485,01:07:14.030,What are you doing? Burn them now!
01:07:15.865,01:07:17.825,-Sir! -My lord.
01:07:17.908,01:07:19.076,Please calm down.
01:07:19.160,01:07:20.161,"No, sir!"
01:07:23.289,01:07:24.415,It's dangerous!
01:07:52.651,01:07:53.652,I'm sorry.
01:07:56.864,01:08:00.076,"Thankfully, it's just the ends that burnt a little."
01:08:02.369,01:08:05.998,I must apologize to your mother.
01:08:17.176,01:08:18.636,Why'd you do it?
01:08:19.512,01:08:21.347,It's a keepsake from your mother.
01:08:22.890,01:08:28.104,How am I to repay you for what you did for me?
01:08:32.900,01:08:36.195,It's enough for me to know that I can do this for you.
01:08:38.739,01:08:42.409,It's unfortunate that I can't do more.
01:09:58.444,01:09:59.862,I had a dream.
01:10:01.280,01:10:03.240,What was it about?
01:10:04.074,01:10:06.160,"People were gathered, dancing."
01:10:07.161,01:10:13.876,It was the kind of place where there was no need to harm anyone or to use a sword to keep my life.
01:10:15.169,01:10:20.591,Everyone mingled together. All were happy.
01:10:24.929,01:10:31.268,"There, you and I were holding hands, smiling."
01:10:36.815,01:10:39.902,That hand felt so warm.
01:10:41.862,01:10:43.364,That's a good dream.
01:10:52.706,01:10:53.540,Ga-hee.
01:10:54.458,01:10:58.128,I know your sorrows.
01:11:00.130,01:11:05.010,I want to live with you as we did in my dream.
01:11:18.190,01:11:22.903,"No matter what happens, I'll never let go of your hand."
01:11:27.616,01:11:29.368,Can you promise me the same?
01:11:33.163,01:11:34.206,Yes.
01:11:58.147,01:12:00.816,I can't remember the last time we met face-to-face.
01:12:02.818,01:12:04.486,You're right.
01:12:06.113,01:12:11.243,What can this old man do for you?
01:12:11.327,01:12:14.288,"Some time ago, the chief paid me a visit."
01:12:14.371,01:12:16.999,I asked him a question he couldn't answer.
01:12:17.082,01:12:20.878,So I came to ask you myself.
01:12:24.840,01:12:27.676,What's the reason behind the big-scale training?
01:12:27.760,01:12:32.973,So we can attack Yodong and build the Great Joseon Empire.
01:12:33.057,01:12:36.018,Sounds very familiar to me.
01:12:36.101,01:12:37.394,What do you mean?
01:12:38.354,01:12:42.066,How we went to attack Yodong and came back.
01:12:42.149,01:12:44.568,You take it too far.
01:12:44.651,01:12:49.114,Are you insinuating that I have an ulterior motive?
01:12:49.198,01:12:50.157,No.
01:12:55.329,01:12:59.291,"This way or that way, what does it matter?"
01:13:00.167,01:13:06.965,"Entwined like the kudzu vines in Mansusan, we'll live a hundred years. What a task!"
01:13:12.012,01:13:16.892,There are people keeping private soldiers under the name of hunting and sports.
01:13:16.975,01:13:20.896,We must punish them severely and tighten the military discipline.
01:13:21.397,01:13:25.609,These are crucial steps to strengthen the roots of this country.
01:13:25.692,01:13:34.076,"If we ban hunting and sports for military appropriation, we'll demote the spirits of the officers and they'll end up becoming our enemies."
01:13:34.785,01:13:38.789,"So if you build or work for the palace, you can play to your heart's content?"
01:13:40.040,01:13:44.378,"From today, all hunting and sports shall be banned."
01:13:44.461,01:13:47.631,Collect all private weaponry and horses!
01:13:50.968,01:13:53.804,I've come to deliver a royal command.
01:13:54.721,01:13:58.934,"All horses, except for transportation, shall be returned to Armed Forces."
01:13:59.017,01:14:02.020,He is also banning hunting and sports.
01:14:03.230,01:14:04.773,What did you just say?
01:14:06.817,01:14:08.569,What is he banning?
01:14:08.652,01:14:10.779,Hunting and sports.
01:14:12.156,01:14:16.243,He's banning hunting and sports?
01:14:17.077,01:14:22.124,What caused His Majesty to become so weak?
01:14:30.257,01:14:33.135,Can I get some time to decide what message to send back?
01:14:34.011,01:14:34.887,Sure.
01:14:36.388,01:14:37.222,Thanks.
01:16:01.598,01:16:03.183,"Look, Min-jae."
01:16:05.769,01:16:07.271,I've only got one horse left.
01:16:09.690,01:16:14.403,There's none to return to you.
01:16:15.571,01:16:16.947,What shall we do?
01:16:25.789,01:16:29.042,Prince Jeongan is not to be taken lightly.
01:16:30.919,01:16:33.422,We can't stop him using these methods.
01:16:35.424,01:16:37.593,"One wrong step, and he might strike first."
01:16:38.635,01:16:41.138,That means we are the ones in danger.
01:16:41.888,01:16:44.391,We didn't found this country to die at his hand!
01:16:45.767,01:16:47.519,The time is right.
01:16:48.103,01:16:55.277,"Before we leave for Yodong, we will need to first take care of Prince Jeongan."
01:16:57.654,01:17:00.032,The timing will be important.
01:17:04.661,01:17:05.996,Gyeongsin's Vigil.
01:17:06.079,01:17:08.081,Gyeongsin's Vigil.
01:17:08.665,01:17:10.959,Everyone will be up feasting all night.
01:17:11.793,01:17:14.880,It'll be easier to get in amid the festivities.
01:17:14.963,01:17:19.051,They won't miss the chance either.
01:17:21.094,01:17:22.846,They too will have military plans.
01:17:23.764,01:17:30.228,"When His Majesty rises in the afternoon, everything will have been taken care of."
01:17:31.647,01:17:33.190,Can we do it?
01:17:33.774,01:17:37.736,That would depend on the sword-tip of the chief.
01:17:52.376,01:17:53.835,Carry this sword for me.
01:17:54.336,01:17:56.338,Use it to protect the crown prince.
01:17:56.880,01:17:59.508,This is my first request and a royal command to you.
01:18:00.092,01:18:03.011,Who raised you a person out of a savage?
01:18:04.012,01:18:07.724,You have to protect His Majesty and me with your life.
01:18:09.976,01:18:13.730,This is a sachet His Majesty bestowed on his son-in-law.
01:18:28.245,01:18:30.706,You and I came together for a cause.
01:18:32.332,01:18:35.627,Now it's about time for us to start acting on it.
01:18:36.962,01:18:38.964,I'll send you a message.
01:18:39.047,01:18:45.762,"Once you act on your plan, not only will that household collapse but also the military of the country."
01:18:47.180,01:18:52.102,What happens to the chief then?
01:18:55.522,01:18:58.525,What do you think?
01:19:24.843,01:19:26.052,It's late.
01:19:27.471,01:19:29.055,I shall get going.
01:19:54.247,01:19:56.416,This is the girl I told you about.
01:20:17.395,01:20:21.024,This will become your mother and your duty from now on.
01:20:22.025,01:20:26.863,You can never forget how your mother died.
01:20:28.156,01:20:29.658,It's a peony.
01:20:29.741,01:20:30.951,Keep it in mind.
01:20:35.664,01:20:39.292,"Thankfully, it's just the ends that burnt a little."
01:21:08.238,01:21:10.574,Prince Jeongan will attack with his soldiers.
01:21:10.657,01:21:12.784,They will probably go for the East Gate.
01:21:12.868,01:21:16.705,Gather all available forces to prepare for every situation.
01:21:16.788,01:21:17.789,I've brought it.
01:21:28.341,01:21:32.220,I'd like to meet you in private on Gyeongsin's Vigil.
01:21:32.762,01:21:36.391,There we go. I knew she'd cave.
01:21:42.147,01:21:43.607,Is that medicine for my lady?
01:21:44.232,01:21:45.567,"Yes, sir."
01:21:46.818,01:21:50.572,Give it to me. I'll take it to her myself.
01:21:52.449,01:21:57.621,I'm suddenly very light-headed. I don't think I can make it.
01:21:57.704,01:22:03.168,I'll be sure to let His Majesty know so go ahead and get some rest.
01:22:07.130,01:22:10.175,"Sir, Kim Min-jae is on the move."
01:22:11.217,01:22:13.011,How long have I been sleeping?
01:22:13.094,01:22:15.096,A little less than an hour.
01:22:18.892,01:22:25.357,"What you're about to do from now, even the Heavens will never know."
01:22:40.997,01:22:43.500,We offer our greetings to His Majesty and the crown prince.
01:22:47.045,01:22:47.963,Where's Gyeongsun?
01:22:48.755,01:22:51.341,"She's not feeling well, but she sends her regards."
01:22:51.424,01:22:53.885,Oh no. Is she very ill?
01:22:53.969,01:22:55.762,It's nothing to cause you to worry.
01:22:55.845,01:22:58.264,I think she was weak and light-headed.
01:22:59.349,01:23:03.395,"If sister is unwell, could you send her some medicine?"
01:23:04.312,01:23:05.397,Of course.
01:23:08.692,01:23:15.198,That's why I would like to leave early so I can take care of the princess.
01:23:15.281,01:23:16.282,Do that.
01:23:17.659,01:23:19.703,What a sweet husband he is!
01:23:26.668,01:23:28.336,A message from the peony?
01:23:29.004,01:23:31.840,I just sent the soldiers to the prearranged location.
01:23:45.478,01:23:46.479,Is everything ready?
01:23:46.563,01:23:48.606,"Yes, everything's in perfect order."
01:23:56.823,01:23:58.992,I forgive you for the other day.
01:23:59.701,01:24:04.330,"But today, you better do it right."
01:24:08.209,01:24:10.003,Because I don't like making a loss.
01:24:13.423,01:24:16.593,"If you took from me a token of affection, you should return the favor."
01:24:28.480,01:24:35.612,"As I looked for ways to survive, I saw that your father was a better choice so I changed my mind."
01:24:36.529,01:24:37.739,How dare you!
01:24:41.159,01:24:42.660,Crazy bitch.
01:24:45.205,01:24:46.372,Say that again.
01:24:47.290,01:24:50.168,Say it with that dirty mouth of yours.
01:24:51.544,01:24:55.048,That dirty mouth! Damn it!
01:25:48.184,01:25:49.644,Attack!
01:26:17.797,01:26:20.133,What's all the noise? Go see what it is.
01:26:50.788,01:26:52.790,"Your Majesty, Crown Prince."
01:26:52.874,01:26:54.500,You must escape.
01:26:56.753,01:26:59.547,What are you doing? Protect His Majesty!
01:27:01.799,01:27:03.092,Stop it at this instant!
01:27:03.676,01:27:05.511,They've plotted treason.
01:27:05.595,01:27:07.764,"That's not possible, Your Majesty."
01:27:07.847,01:27:11.100,It looks like Prince Jeongan brought in his troops.
01:27:11.184,01:27:16.231,Sambong! How dare you tell a lie in his presence!
01:27:18.233,01:27:20.109,"Bang-won, you bastard!"
01:27:20.193,01:27:24.280,Kim Min-jae placed troops by the East Gate looking for a chance to plot treason.
01:27:24.364,01:27:25.823,That's slander!
01:27:26.324,01:27:32.705,"If he wasn't plotting treason, what were the soldiers doing here instead of guarding the forts?"
01:27:32.789,01:27:39.295,Sambong and Kim Min-jae found out that Kim Jin committed adultery who is their family and the son-in-law of His Majesty.
01:27:39.379,01:27:45.134,"They were trying to kill me and my men who knew about this to hide what happened, thereby plotting a treason."
01:27:45.218,01:27:47.136,What are you saying?
01:27:48.137,01:27:51.349,Who committed adultery with who?
01:27:53.393,01:27:55.603,My son-in-law committed a deadly crime?
01:27:56.312,01:27:58.231,How can I trust you?
01:27:58.314,01:28:03.152,I have evidence that they do not have.
01:28:20.545,01:28:23.506,-Bring them in. -Here are the sinners!
01:28:34.142,01:28:36.811,-Gyeongsun! -Father.
01:28:53.244,01:28:56.039,Today's feast ends now.
01:28:56.622,01:29:01.878,"Imprison the sinners and everyone else, leave!"
01:29:36.287,01:29:38.289,How could such mishap happen?
01:29:50.343,01:29:51.803,Who's the letter from?
01:29:53.221,01:29:58.643,Lady Ga-hee asked me to give this to you at the 23rd hour.
01:30:00.645,01:30:06.651,"If you come to the shed now, you'll see how the story ends."
01:30:19.330,01:30:22.208,"Look, I-- Get away."
01:30:22.792,01:30:24.794,I'll listen to her story.
01:30:25.628,01:30:35.471,I was just… She seduced me and… Her appearance says otherwise.
01:30:37.557,01:30:42.103,Tell me. Why're you letting me know?
01:30:42.728,01:30:51.487,Can you forgive a husband who toyed with you and stay with him for the rest of your life?
01:30:51.571,01:30:53.072,How dare you!
01:30:53.948,01:30:56.242,I could tell my father and have you killed!
01:30:57.243,01:30:59.871,I never wished to live.
01:31:00.705,01:31:07.587,But I didn't want to taint the name of my lord and this is all I could do as a lowly girl.
01:31:09.130,01:31:10.548,I hope you understand.
01:31:12.133,01:31:15.887,"I don't care what happens to me, but please spare my lord."
01:31:16.804,01:31:18.055,Who is this?
01:31:23.603,01:31:27.523,That's as far as I know.
01:31:29.650,01:31:32.278,Bang-won was not one to stay low.
01:31:32.945,01:31:36.866,You never should've given him the chance.
01:31:39.327,01:31:43.372,I trusted you and asked you so.
01:31:43.456,01:31:49.587,Is this what I get for showing you my affection?
01:31:49.670,01:31:51.297,Please kill me.
01:31:51.380,01:31:55.009,I'll spare your life as requested by the princess.
01:31:55.092,01:32:00.640,So kill the girl discreetly tonight.
01:32:04.018,01:32:05.353,Why the silence?
01:32:11.984,01:32:13.277,Are you going to disobey?
01:32:14.195,01:32:18.991,Do you intend to give them an excuse to put me and Crown Prince in danger?
01:32:19.992,01:32:23.246,Kill the girl to shut their mouth. It's a royal command!
01:33:09.750,01:33:12.461,Was it all planned from the beginning?
01:33:13.629,01:33:16.882,Did you really use me to get your mother's revenge?
01:33:18.134,01:33:19.135,Tell me.
01:33:21.178,01:33:24.015,What good would it do for me to tell you now?
01:33:25.516,01:33:30.479,You know fully well that denying it won't make a difference.
01:33:30.563,01:33:32.773,Do you really want to die in my hands?
01:33:33.441,01:33:36.652,"If I was afraid of dying, I never would've begun."
01:33:37.778,01:33:43.701,"If I'm guilty of something, it's that I was born a lowly girl and have survived rather than dying."
01:33:45.036,01:33:47.288,How is it a sin to have survived?
01:33:47.371,01:33:50.166,It's a sin because a lowly girl survived.
01:33:51.083,01:33:54.003,It's a sin because something less than a person survived.
01:33:54.086,01:33:58.424,"In this country, a cow is worth more than three lowly lives."
01:33:59.383,01:34:03.012,A lowly girl is okay to be raped and killed without punishment.
01:34:03.679,01:34:08.684,But touching his father's concubine will get one punished by blood.
01:34:10.061,01:34:13.606,"When you were with me, were you ever..."
01:34:17.026,01:34:20.071,were you not once real with me?
01:34:20.821,01:34:23.658,"When my mother died, I also died."
01:34:24.241,01:34:28.329,"The death of my mother is unforgivable, even if the king's son-in-law gets killed."
01:34:29.830,01:34:34.126,I can jump into hell fire if it means he gets the punishment he deserves.
01:34:35.920,01:34:40.633,This is the real me.
01:34:51.435,01:34:52.436,No.
01:34:53.396,01:34:56.440,"If this is the truth, why'd you let the princess know?"
01:34:57.358,01:34:59.026,You were trying to spare my life!
01:34:59.819,01:35:03.656,You were trying to change the plan to take this all on your own.
01:35:04.573,01:35:05.491,Kill me.
01:35:06.450,01:35:09.995,-I must die for you to live. -Stop.
01:35:11.038,01:35:13.040,Don't ever forgive me.
01:35:20.840,01:35:25.344,I will never forgive.
01:35:29.640,01:35:30.474,So...
01:35:33.811,01:35:34.812,you must live.
01:35:48.826,01:35:49.744,Sir.
01:35:54.498,01:35:56.584,Didn't I tell you to go away!
01:36:07.470,01:36:10.681,The girl and Kim Min-jae have run away.
01:36:13.642,01:36:15.060,What will you do?
01:36:16.896,01:36:20.733,Kim Min-jae committed a serious crime of disobeying a royal command.
01:36:25.196,01:36:46.675,"All related issues… can be entrusted with me, your son."
01:37:06.237,01:37:08.405,Have you done no wrong at all?
01:37:08.489,01:37:10.241,This is not fair.
01:37:12.701,01:37:15.663,I knew that lowly thing stole it from me for money.
01:37:16.247,01:37:18.207,I just scared her a bit to get it back.
01:37:19.166,01:37:20.334,I see.
01:37:23.671,01:37:26.632,You're my husband. I trust your words.
01:37:28.634,01:37:31.428,I will explain to Father.
01:37:32.721,01:37:33.722,"Thank you, my lady."
01:37:48.737,01:37:54.118,"But I knew that at one point, I didn't smell the sachet on you."
01:37:58.205,01:38:03.502,"Well-- Instead, the scent started coming from Ga-hee."
01:38:08.924,01:38:15.973,It was unthinkable to me so I didn't say anything.
01:38:19.560,01:38:27.443,"Had you told me the truth, I wasn't going to do this."
01:38:41.457,01:38:42.875,Fire on!
01:38:45.002,01:38:45.961,Shoot!
01:39:20.412,01:39:21.246,Watch out!
01:39:28.212,01:39:31.173,Give me a chance to handle him.
01:39:49.692,01:39:51.068,Get in.
01:39:53.320,01:39:54.863,You must come with me.
01:39:55.447,01:39:56.991,I will survive and follow.
01:39:57.074,01:39:59.952,How can you tell me to go without you?
01:40:05.457,01:40:06.500,Don't worry.
01:40:08.919,01:40:10.170,I'll be right behind you.
01:40:12.256,01:40:15.634,So you must live.
01:40:21.682,01:40:22.850,No.
01:40:26.061,01:40:28.564,My lord!
01:40:31.900,01:40:32.901,My lord!
01:40:35.070,01:40:35.904,My lord!
01:40:38.365,01:40:39.199,My lord!
01:40:41.368,01:40:42.745,My lord!
01:40:49.501,01:40:51.086,"No, my lord!"
01:40:53.672,01:40:54.506,My lord.
01:41:26.038,01:41:27.331,My lord.
01:42:30.769,01:42:33.605,My lord!
01:42:33.689,01:42:34.815,Come on!
01:42:35.566,01:42:37.151,Get away now!
01:42:38.694,01:42:39.611,My lord!
01:42:44.283,01:42:47.452,-Didn't I promise I'd protect you? -My lord!
01:42:51.790,01:42:53.458,What are you doing!
01:42:53.542,01:42:56.253,That I'd protect you no matter what comes our way.
01:42:56.753,01:42:58.881,-I gave you my word. -My lord!
01:43:13.729,01:43:15.272,My lord.
01:43:57.231,01:43:58.232,My lord!
01:45:12.597,01:45:15.100,My lord!
01:46:21.917,01:46:26.713,"No matter what happens, I'll never let go of your hand."
01:46:29.257,01:46:31.259,Can you promise me the same?
01:46:33.053,01:46:33.887,Yes.
01:46:53.990,01:46:55.033,I had a dream.
01:46:56.743,01:46:58.745,What was it about?
01:47:01.873,01:47:04.000,"People were gathered, dancing."
01:47:05.794,01:47:13.885,It was the kind of place where there was no need to harm anyone or to use a sword to keep my life.
