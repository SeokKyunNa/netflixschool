00:05:41.750,00:05:43.416,"I think you dropped something, no?"
00:05:44.958,00:05:45.875,No?
00:05:52.500,00:05:53.541,Did you buy this inside?
00:05:53.625,00:05:55.625,"-No, it's not ours. -Don't worry, relax."
00:05:58.708,00:05:59.875,It's all good.
00:05:59.958,00:06:01.416,You boys are lucky.
00:06:01.916,00:06:03.541,You got your whole lives ahead of you.
00:06:33.583,00:06:35.291,You all leave.
00:06:35.375,00:06:38.708,Leave. Move fast.
00:06:53.791,00:06:59.250,"I told you, you dumb motherfucker, to watch his every move..."
00:06:59.875,00:07:02.375,...and yet Amir Asif has grabbed my son.
00:07:03.625,00:07:04.875,We can negotiate.
00:07:04.958,00:07:06.833,"This isn't about ransom, Saju."
00:07:08.458,00:07:09.833,It's about humiliation.
00:07:17.833,00:07:18.958,Go to Dhaka.
00:07:21.250,00:07:22.166,And do what?
00:07:22.250,00:07:23.833,Steal him back.
00:07:24.833,00:07:26.583,"I'd need an army, Ovi."
00:07:26.666,00:07:28.541,Then hire a fucking army!
00:07:32.291,00:07:33.666,What do you think?
00:07:35.416,00:07:38.791,You think I can't hurt you from here?
00:07:40.750,00:07:42.083,"Ovi, please..."
00:07:43.666,00:07:46.958,You want your son to see his next birthday?
00:07:49.333,00:07:50.375,Then...
00:07:51.708,00:07:53.541,get mine back.
00:08:09.666,00:08:12.333,Tell Mahajan to pay the ransom and get his son back.
00:08:14.791,00:08:16.000,Why are they getting us involved in this?
00:08:21.416,00:08:22.541,Neysa...
00:08:23.958,00:08:25.416,There's not enough money.
00:08:25.916,00:08:28.333,The NCB have frozen Mahajan's assets.
00:08:41.708,00:08:44.166,There's a man who does this sort of thing.
00:08:44.666,00:08:48.291,His price will be out of Mahajan's reach.
00:08:48.916,00:08:50.666,But there's a way I can play this.
00:08:50.750,00:08:52.250,It will not be easy.
00:08:54.458,00:08:55.875,Do whatever you have to.
00:17:09.833,00:17:11.041,Proof.
00:17:11.916,00:17:12.916,Money.
00:17:13.541,00:17:14.458,Proof.
00:17:16.958,00:17:18.166,Show me proof.
00:17:18.250,00:17:19.833,Money!
00:18:06.416,00:18:07.375,Bastard!
00:18:07.458,00:18:09.250,Didn't even blink!
00:18:32.625,00:18:33.833,"Come on, boy!"
00:18:34.625,00:18:36.208,Show me your face.
00:18:39.333,00:18:41.375,Beautiful!
00:19:18.625,00:19:19.458,Move it!
00:19:19.541,00:19:21.166,Let's go!
00:24:29.041,00:24:31.125,Sons of bitches.
00:24:32.250,00:24:34.208,Anybody feel like they remember now?
00:24:38.083,00:24:38.916,Wait!
00:24:40.041,00:24:40.916,I know...
00:24:46.500,00:24:47.500,I know who took the money.
00:24:47.583,00:24:48.416,Who?
00:24:48.500,00:24:50.125,-Sanjib. -Who's Sanjib?
00:24:50.208,00:24:52.500,You just threw him off the roof.
00:24:56.166,00:24:57.166,Come here.
00:25:05.208,00:25:06.291,What's your name?
00:25:06.375,00:25:07.500,Farhad.
00:25:07.583,00:25:08.916,Farhad?
00:25:10.416,00:25:12.333,You're pretty clever.
00:25:15.625,00:25:17.083,Pay attention...
00:25:17.166,00:25:18.208,and learn...
00:25:19.083,00:25:20.666,that's how you survive.
00:25:21.250,00:25:24.750,You need to be smart. Use your wits.
00:25:26.541,00:25:27.708,Farhad?
00:25:40.583,00:25:42.458,Cut off two of your fingers.
00:25:43.458,00:25:44.583,Any two.
00:25:45.083,00:25:45.916,Why?
00:25:46.000,00:25:50.666,Because the kid who stole from me is dead.
00:25:51.333,00:25:57.958,And I'd like a walking reminder of what happens when you touch my money.
00:26:02.791,00:26:04.458,I'd recommend the left hand.
00:26:05.125,00:26:08.500,So you can still hold a gun.
00:26:16.166,00:26:17.000,Amir!
00:26:17.083,00:26:18.416,I am talking!
00:26:18.500,00:26:19.750,"Amir, we lost the kid."
00:26:28.833,00:26:31.750,Clever and lucky...
00:26:38.500,00:26:39.916,Close the city.
00:26:40.500,00:26:41.791,"Bridges, trains, airports..."
00:26:41.875,00:26:43.166,Close everything.
00:26:43.750,00:26:44.833,"Impossible, Amir."
00:26:48.875,00:26:56.958,"Make it possible, Colonel, or you'll lose more than just a finger."
00:30:24.916,00:30:27.875,Blockades have been set up on every bridge into and out of Dhaka.
00:30:28.458,00:30:31.666,I have teams combing the Buriganga as we speak.
00:30:31.750,00:30:33.166,"We'll find them, sir."
00:30:39.458,00:30:40.708,I like this one.
00:30:41.375,00:30:43.958,Get him a gun. Put his fingers to work.
00:32:44.750,00:32:48.625,"Colonel, stand by. We think we found something."
00:33:58.416,00:34:00.208,We need air support by the river.
00:34:00.291,00:34:02.000,They're in the forest.
00:34:20.500,00:34:21.791,"Ovi, it's Saju!"
00:34:22.416,00:34:23.666,I'm here to take you home!
00:40:11.250,00:40:13.875,Help! Help! Help!
00:40:20.416,00:40:21.875,Come here.
00:40:32.458,00:44:42.625,"Come here, you little shit-- Are you hurt?"
00:46:32.041,00:46:35.083,The vehicle crashed. It flipped over and is in flames.
00:46:37.291,00:46:38.750,I want to see the bodies.
00:46:41.583,00:46:42.875,We're coming.
00:47:37.166,00:47:38.166,They're still alive.
00:47:38.750,00:47:41.541,One is seriously injured.
00:47:44.791,00:47:49.416,I want every gun in Dhaka pointed at this guy.
00:53:39.625,00:53:40.666,Are you okay?
00:53:41.416,00:53:43.000,Listen to me carefully.
00:53:43.833,00:53:50.375,"If you don't hear from me in the next 12 hours, take the cash and go."
00:53:51.750,00:53:53.250,Disappear.
00:53:55.250,00:53:56.666,"You understand me, right?"
00:53:57.833,00:53:58.916,I will...
00:54:00.208,00:54:01.541,Are you okay?
00:54:02.708,00:54:04.000,I'm fine.
00:54:05.333,00:54:07.291,Just tired.
00:54:22.708,00:54:25.458,"Aarav, Papa's on the phone."
00:54:35.000,00:54:37.083,Are you coming home soon?
00:54:37.791,00:54:40.750,"Yes, it'll be very soon."
00:54:40.833,00:54:41.750,When?
00:54:46.166,00:54:48.125,When you wake up in the morning.
00:54:51.666,00:54:53.833,"You help your mother, okay?"
00:54:54.833,00:54:57.791,"Yes, Papa, I will."
00:56:54.083,00:56:57.791,"-Hey, this guy wants my gun! -My ankle is broken!"
00:57:00.166,00:57:01.333,Leave my gun.
00:57:01.416,00:57:02.666,Leave it!
00:57:02.750,00:57:04.708,My friend is gonna shoot you!
00:57:04.791,00:57:07.250,Hey! Give me my gun... Give it back!
00:57:07.333,00:57:09.375,"That's my gun, give it back to me!"
00:57:10.666,00:57:12.583,Give it back or I'll blow you away!
00:58:00.458,00:58:01.583,Son of a bitch!
00:58:20.583,00:58:21.958,I'll kill you!
00:58:23.000,00:58:24.541,I'll murder you.
01:04:16.333,01:04:17.416,Don't you see I'm eating?
01:04:18.000,01:04:20.083,-I had him... -Had who?
01:04:20.166,01:04:21.833,The man you want.
01:04:22.416,01:04:24.416,I lost him...
01:04:24.500,01:04:25.625,near the market.
01:04:26.625,01:04:28.625,Tell them to scour the market.
01:04:28.708,01:04:29.916,"Yes, sir."
01:04:39.250,01:04:41.291,-What is this? -A gift.
01:04:42.000,01:04:46.666,"When you catch him, I want to be the one to pull the trigger."
01:04:47.333,01:04:52.666,"If you let me do that, I'll give you the other finger!"
01:05:08.750,01:05:09.958,He made me feel like a fool.
01:05:11.500,01:05:12.708,Of course he did.
01:05:16.125,01:05:17.833,You're only a kid.
01:05:37.208,01:05:41.333,"Here's some advice, a gift."
01:05:43.333,01:05:46.583,Keep your other finger.
01:05:47.250,01:05:51.125,Because no matter how badass you think you are...
01:05:51.750,01:05:55.458,there's always a badass who's bigger than you.
01:11:31.791,01:11:35.875,Estancia Los Chanares.
01:23:16.333,01:23:18.250,We'll have to go on foot.
01:23:45.083,01:23:46.500,Any sign of the boy?
01:23:47.083,01:23:48.208,Not yet.
01:23:48.833,01:23:50.625,But we've seen our friend...
01:23:51.250,01:23:52.583,the kid must be near.
01:24:51.625,01:24:56.291,Don't cross the bridge.
01:24:58.791,01:25:00.916,I'm telling you to stop!
01:25:06.583,01:25:08.500,Take his hat off. Let me see his face.
01:25:08.583,01:25:09.458,I don't understand.
01:25:09.541,01:25:11.583,His hat. Take it off.
01:25:17.375,01:25:18.916,Do what he says.
01:26:26.916,01:26:28.250,Take two more units to the bridge.
01:26:30.333,01:26:32.041,Two units to the bridge. Hurry.
01:26:33.458,01:26:34.791,Bring me my rifle!
00:02:52.333,00:02:53.625,That's epic! Good!
00:02:55.083,00:02:57.166,Go over and tell her who you are and get her one coffee.
00:02:57.250,00:02:58.791,"No, I don't have money for it."
00:03:00.750,00:03:01.875,She's looking at you. She's blushing.
00:03:01.958,00:03:03.875,"She's blushing. Dude, she wants you."
00:03:03.958,00:03:04.958,"-Go over and talk -No, no, no."
00:03:10.916,00:03:12.791,"-That's Ovi, though. -Isn't that hilarious?"
00:03:12.875,00:03:13.875,No! No!
00:03:54.333,00:03:55.416,Hmm?
00:04:46.833,00:04:47.833,I'm gonna come back.
00:04:53.458,00:04:54.291,Hey.
00:05:03.500,00:05:06.875,Hey! What's up? He talk to her yet?
00:05:07.541,00:05:08.458,Ah!
00:05:08.541,00:05:09.750,Did you talk to her yet?
00:05:10.333,00:05:11.166,No.
00:05:11.250,00:05:14.416,"Did he talk to... Come on, Ovi. You gotta go talk to her."
00:05:14.500,00:05:15.791,"Oh, she's smiling."
00:05:16.708,00:05:18.250,I know what you need. Come on.
00:05:24.750,00:05:26.875,"Try it. Take one hit, man, it'll help you."
00:05:35.500,00:05:36.583,Ah...
00:05:36.666,00:05:39.000,Are you guys from inside? Huh?
00:08:31.750,00:08:33.125,You understand?
00:08:35.416,00:08:36.458,Animals!
00:09:20.833,00:09:22.125,"It's fuckin' beautiful, though."
00:09:32.708,00:09:34.375,Quit swearin' all the time.
00:09:34.916,00:09:36.500,-So? -It makes you sound stupid.
00:09:36.583,00:09:38.166,Find another fuckin' adjective.
00:09:40.333,00:09:41.291,Told you he's fine.
00:10:01.583,00:10:03.625,"-Hold my beer, would you? -Oh, I gotcha."
00:11:34.208,00:11:35.041,"Come here, girl."
00:11:36.875,00:11:37.708,Hey.
00:11:58.333,00:12:01.000,There's a chicken in your bathroom.
00:12:01.083,00:12:04.125,"Yeah, I like chickens, except when they shit everywhere."
00:12:15.291,00:12:16.333,We landed the whale.
00:12:17.166,00:12:18.000,"Oh, yeah?"
00:12:18.083,00:12:21.500,Extraction. Indian kid. Drug lord's son.
00:12:21.583,00:12:23.791,A rival gangster is holding this kid in Dhaka.
00:12:24.541,00:12:25.958,I think Gaspar lives in Dhaka.
00:12:26.041,00:12:27.583,Gaspar is out of the game.
00:12:28.500,00:12:31.916,"Clock's running at 16 hours. Deadline, Friday, noon."
00:12:32.000,00:12:33.916,Proof of life as of six hours ago.
00:12:40.041,00:12:41.250,"Yeah, I'll take it."
00:12:50.791,00:12:55.166,"This gangster, Amir Asif, he holds a massive sway in Dhaka."
00:12:55.250,00:12:58.875,"You get your hands on this kid, it's gonna get complicated."
00:12:59.666,00:13:01.625,"It's always fuckin' complicated, innit?"
00:13:12.458,00:13:13.583,This was a mistake.
00:13:16.625,00:13:20.708,"Nik, what are you doing here? Don't bullshit yourself."
00:13:21.333,00:13:24.208,No one else is gonna commit to somethin' this fucked up.
00:13:33.208,00:13:34.416,And why would you?
00:13:35.041,00:13:36.458,I need the money.
00:13:37.958,00:13:39.333,Chickens aren't cheap.
00:13:41.541,00:13:45.791,"You're hoping if you spin the chamber enough times, you're gonna catch a bullet."
00:13:51.916,00:13:55.500,"Tomorrow morning, I'll meet you in Fitzroy Crossing."
00:13:55.583,00:13:57.750,"If you're not sober, don't show up."
00:14:06.083,00:14:07.166,What's his name?
00:14:08.333,00:14:11.750,Ovi. Ovi Mahajan.
00:14:13.416,00:14:15.083,"Head on straight, Tyler."
00:15:04.291,00:15:07.291,"His father, Ovi Mahajan Senior, is in jail."
00:15:07.375,00:15:11.208,"So, his people employed us to get the boy back, and they refuse to negotiate."
00:15:11.291,00:15:12.625,What about our opposition?
00:15:16.000,00:15:19.333,Biggest drug lord in India versus biggest drug lord in Bangladesh.
00:15:19.416,00:15:20.666,Sounds like some mythic shit.
00:15:23.125,00:15:31.125,"This is our extraction point. So, José and Thiago will man a boat, ferry you and the kid nine miles down the river to a chopper."
00:15:31.208,00:15:33.458,-Any questions? -How many hostiles on site?
00:16:49.208,00:16:50.458,Now what?
00:16:51.041,00:16:52.333,Welcome to Dhaka.
00:17:40.916,00:17:45.583,"Listen, you boys seem like real busy professionals, so let's say we cut this shit and get down to business, yeah?"
00:17:49.000,00:17:49.916,Okay.
00:18:21.000,00:18:22.208,Enough talk.
00:18:24.708,00:18:26.250,Let's get to business.
00:18:55.416,00:18:57.791,Tell them. Pay.
00:18:57.875,00:18:59.375,If not?
00:19:01.875,00:19:03.166,I take this...
00:19:04.666,00:19:07.708,stick in his ass and blow his insides out.
00:23:03.625,00:23:04.833,Shh!
00:23:05.666,00:23:07.041,Who are you?
00:23:15.125,00:23:16.250,-Can you walk? -Yeah.
00:23:16.333,00:23:18.750,All right. Put this on.
00:24:36.000,00:24:36.958,Huh?
00:26:58.291,00:26:59.125,Hmm?
00:27:26.333,00:27:28.208,Here. Hey.
00:27:38.416,00:27:40.416,"Kid, you wanna survive, you do exactly as I say."
00:27:42.750,00:27:43.791,Here. Put these on.
00:28:05.333,00:28:07.750,"Here. Eat this. Your blood sugar is low, that's why you feel like shit."
00:28:17.958,00:28:20.416,Twenty-one hundred meters out. In possession.
00:28:27.916,00:28:29.125,All right. Arms up.
00:28:52.291,00:28:53.500,"Say your name, mate."
00:28:54.250,00:28:55.875,"Say your bloody name, come on."
00:28:57.541,00:28:59.541,-Ovi. -Last name?
00:28:59.625,00:29:00.458,Mahajan.
00:29:00.541,00:29:01.708,Your birthday?
00:29:01.791,00:29:04.125,"21st of January, 2005."
00:29:04.750,00:29:07.625,Proceeding to extraction. Let's go.
00:29:22.125,00:29:25.708,Satellite's online. Rake and the kid are on route.
00:29:29.791,00:29:30.791,You good?
00:29:32.500,00:29:33.583,Good.
00:29:49.583,00:29:50.708,Ready and waiting.
00:29:53.791,00:29:56.708,"-Your birthday? -21st of January, 2005."
00:30:03.375,00:30:05.500,You have seven minutes to transfer the funds.
00:30:11.250,00:30:12.833,It's G. I'm in position.
00:30:21.666,00:30:24.333,"-G, I need you to be my eyes. -Copy that."
00:31:12.416,00:31:14.500,"Yeah, we gotta keep moving. Come on."
00:31:26.333,00:31:28.250,Rake's about five minutes from the boat.
00:31:29.083,00:31:30.583,Where are we at with the transfer?
00:31:34.708,00:31:35.833,Where is it?
00:31:35.916,00:31:38.375,"-I don't know. -Well, try it again."
00:31:55.000,00:31:56.666,-Nada. -Fuckin' shit.
00:31:57.250,00:32:01.125,Call them back. Tell them they have 60 seconds to make the transfer.
00:32:01.208,00:32:03.875,Or they'll find Ovi's body floating in the Buriganga.
00:32:14.375,00:32:15.750,We're getting played.
00:32:21.291,00:32:22.125,Thiago?
00:32:23.916,00:32:25.583,-Thiago? -Shit.
00:32:30.666,00:32:33.625,"Tyler, something's wrong. Hold your position."
00:32:33.708,00:32:34.541,Holding.
00:32:35.458,00:32:37.875,"G, you got eyes on the boat?"
00:32:37.958,00:32:40.833,I'm looking at it right now. Our boys haven't come up yet.
00:32:40.916,00:32:42.541,I'm moving in for a closer look.
00:32:49.208,00:32:51.416,"-Nik, you're gonna wanna see this. -What is it?"
00:32:52.708,00:32:53.708,Shit!
00:32:53.791,00:32:55.666,"Tyler, two inbound police boats."
00:32:55.750,00:32:58.375,-Two hundred meters and closing in fast. -G?
00:33:06.625,00:33:07.916,There's someone else in those woods.
00:33:08.000,00:33:11.000,About a hundred meters out and closing in on your position.
00:33:37.708,00:33:42.458,Kid... Move fast. Stay low. Go!
00:33:55.291,00:33:56.166,They found the boat.
00:34:02.083,00:34:03.916,"Tyler, chopper's inbound."
00:34:19.125,00:34:20.416,Down.
00:34:35.833,00:34:39.708,"When I tell you to, run like hell or I'm gonna kill you both. Understand?"
00:34:42.750,00:34:43.583,Go!
00:34:48.208,00:34:49.125,"Okay, go!"
00:34:51.625,00:34:54.000,"Go on, kid. Go, go! Go! Come on."
00:35:25.708,00:35:27.083,Come on! Go!
00:35:41.125,00:35:41.958,Hey! Hey!
00:35:42.625,00:35:44.583,Please let me go! Saju works for my father.
00:35:44.666,00:35:47.458,I work for your father. But something is fucked here.
00:35:47.541,00:35:50.333,Saju could have a deal with the men who grabbed you and send you back to them.
00:35:50.416,00:35:52.625,-Then take me to the police. -The cops are in on it.
00:35:52.708,00:35:54.708,"Look, if you wanna live, you have to trust me."
00:35:56.541,00:35:58.875,I need eyes. Radio's compromised. Call my sat.
00:36:05.666,00:36:08.291,-Turn right. -Can't. Bloody truck is in the way.
00:36:21.916,00:36:23.166,Fuck off!
00:37:05.458,00:37:09.000,"No, no, no! Left! You just passed it."
00:37:14.916,00:37:15.750,Get down!
00:37:29.291,00:37:30.708,I'm in survival mode.
00:37:31.875,00:37:34.083,-Put your belt on. -What belt?
00:37:34.166,00:37:35.333,Your fucking seat belt.
00:37:35.416,00:37:37.541,It's been on. You drive like you're insane!
00:39:35.208,00:39:36.083,Shh.
00:39:46.833,00:39:47.666,Move!
00:40:32.458,00:41:13.541,"Come here, you little shit-- Get up the stairs. Go. Come on. Move!"
00:41:28.166,00:41:29.291,"All right, kid. Do you trust me?"
00:41:29.375,00:41:30.500,-No. -Good.
00:41:38.625,00:41:39.666,"Get up, kid."
00:42:08.625,00:42:09.958,"Stay on my shoulder, all right?"
00:43:59.125,00:44:00.166,Fuck.
00:44:28.125,00:44:29.208,Help!
00:44:31.458,00:44:32.791,Stop there or I will kill you.
00:45:06.083,00:45:08.833,"Get in, kid. Come on. Come on!"
00:45:13.916,00:45:15.750,-You hit him with the truck. -Yeah.
00:46:07.750,00:46:10.250,"All right, kid. I need you to slide on over here."
00:46:12.000,00:46:13.583,"Okay, we're gonna jump on three. All right?"
00:46:13.666,00:46:14.916,-What? -One...
00:48:06.208,00:48:07.791,All right. Close the door. Close it.
00:48:45.916,00:48:46.791,Can you give me a hand?
00:48:49.000,00:48:50.958,I need a hand. Hold that on there.
00:48:53.041,00:48:55.041,Just hook it through there and then pull it back this way.
00:48:55.125,00:48:55.958,Yeah.
00:49:01.083,00:49:02.125,Yep.
00:49:02.208,00:49:03.750,"-Yeah? -Yeah, I got it."
00:49:18.833,00:49:19.833,Yeah?
00:49:22.958,00:49:24.833,He works for the kid's father.
00:49:27.500,00:49:28.666,We were played.
00:49:29.833,00:49:31.208,Second transfer never came through.
00:49:31.791,00:49:35.500,Mahajan got us to do the heavy lifting and he doesn't wanna pay.
00:49:35.583,00:49:36.583,What about G?
00:49:39.708,00:49:40.541,Shit.
00:49:42.375,00:49:45.666,-City's on lockdown. You got cover? -Yeah.
00:49:46.250,00:49:47.166,And the kid?
00:49:49.583,00:49:50.541,He's with me.
00:49:52.250,00:49:59.000,"There's a clearing on east side of Sultana Kamal Bridge, just outside the city. We can send a chopper and get you out."
00:49:59.666,00:50:02.416,-How far? -Four kilometers.
00:50:06.416,00:50:08.333,"You gotta leave the kid behind, Tyler."
00:50:16.666,00:50:17.583,Tyler?
00:50:24.250,00:50:25.208,Tyler?
00:50:28.958,00:50:29.958,That's not the job.
00:50:30.041,00:50:31.500,The job is fucked.
00:50:36.791,00:50:38.375,"Just find my money, Nik."
00:50:55.166,00:50:57.166,Your phone... It's loud.
00:51:00.041,00:51:03.083,"The only chance of getting my money is you, mate. So..."
00:51:03.916,00:51:04.916,no.
00:51:08.750,00:51:10.125,I'm like a package then.
00:51:12.250,00:51:13.333,"Yeah, pretty much."
00:51:14.791,00:51:16.291,In brown paper.
00:51:25.625,00:51:26.708,What are you doing?
00:51:27.333,00:51:28.166,This?
00:51:29.083,00:51:33.375,Piano. I play the piano when I'm nervous.
00:51:34.375,00:51:35.208,It helps.
00:51:36.958,00:51:39.041,My father hates it when I do it.
00:51:44.125,00:51:46.416,He thinks of me the same way you do.
00:51:48.416,00:51:50.125,More like a thing than a person.
00:51:55.500,00:51:57.625,I didn't... I didn't mean it like that.
00:52:03.083,00:52:04.291,It's okay.
00:52:42.958,00:52:44.208,Sir.
00:53:34.291,00:53:35.125,Saju?
00:53:43.833,00:53:46.750,If you don't hear from me in the next 12 hours...
00:54:13.958,00:54:15.666,"I love you, too."
00:54:17.416,00:54:19.000,Put Aarav on the phone.
00:54:27.708,00:54:28.541,Sadia.
00:54:32.458,00:54:33.791,"Hey, champ."
00:55:04.166,00:55:05.833,Always.
00:55:07.875,00:55:09.958,"I love you too, Papa."
00:55:11.541,00:55:12.625,Bye.
00:55:29.750,00:55:30.583,Yeah.
00:55:33.500,00:55:34.875,Copy. I'm on the move.
00:55:37.000,00:55:39.916,"Kid. Kid. Hey, come on."
00:55:55.875,00:55:56.875,Get in. Come here.
00:56:14.125,00:56:15.166,"Come on, you bastard."
00:56:22.541,00:56:23.458,Get out of the car.
00:56:26.291,00:56:27.583,"Go, go, go, go, go!"
00:56:35.083,00:56:36.916,-Stay there! -Yeah.
00:57:07.333,00:57:09.333,"That's my gun, give it back to me!"
00:57:13.750,00:57:15.166,The fuck?
00:58:29.916,00:58:31.541,Fucking shits.
00:58:41.708,00:58:43.208,"Go, go, go, go, go!"
00:59:22.375,00:59:24.125,-Call Gaspar. -What's going on?
00:59:24.208,00:59:27.875,We just got attacked by the goonies from hell. We made it about four blocks.
00:59:27.958,00:59:29.458,I said get rid of the kid.
00:59:29.541,00:59:31.416,I don't give a shit what you said.
00:59:31.500,00:59:33.333,We're in the worst smelling sewer on the planet.
00:59:33.416,00:59:36.458,There's about 200 cops over our heads. Just call Gaspar.
00:59:36.541,00:59:38.166,"Tyler, I don't think that's a good idea."
00:59:38.250,00:59:39.958,"The guy owes me his life, Nik."
00:59:40.041,00:59:42.000,"-Tyler, I-- -Call him."
00:59:54.000,00:59:55.500,Your name's Tyler?
00:59:56.666,00:59:57.500,Mmm-hmm.
01:00:03.291,01:00:04.416,I'm Ovi.
01:00:07.083,01:00:08.583,Nice to meet ya.
01:01:19.416,01:01:20.916,"Yeah, better after the shower."
01:01:34.083,01:01:35.250,Cheers.
01:01:41.875,01:01:43.125,"Good to see you, man."
01:01:44.750,01:01:46.333,I appreciate you coming for us.
01:01:46.416,01:01:48.875,What the hell is wrong with you? Don't insult me.
01:01:51.333,01:01:53.375,-You hungry? -Yeah.
01:01:53.458,01:01:55.083,"Hey, how's that kid?"
01:01:55.166,01:01:56.416,"Uh, he's resting."
01:01:58.666,01:01:59.833,"So, where are we?"
01:02:00.500,01:02:03.916,We are south of the city center.
01:02:04.000,01:02:08.875,I told Nik that an extraction is... It's not feasible.
01:02:08.958,01:02:11.708,"Well, you know, the city is surrounded by rivers."
01:02:11.791,01:02:13.083,There are bridges going in and out.
01:02:13.166,01:02:22.291,But every one of those bridges currently is blocked by a roadblock because you are a very popular individual.
01:02:24.666,01:02:28.250,"I figure we lie low a couple days, we let the panic dissipate."
01:02:28.333,01:02:33.708,"And we'll get you going. Now, my wife made that."
01:02:33.791,01:02:36.333,"So, I want you to be very careful what you say."
01:02:36.416,01:02:37.416,Your wife?
01:02:40.125,01:02:41.458,"And what's that for, the knee?"
01:02:42.083,01:02:44.333,"Yeah, knee, back, shoulder..."
01:02:44.875,01:02:49.208,"Hang on one sec... my knee. Ow! Oh, God. Oh, it hurts."
01:02:50.166,01:02:51.458,Two oughta do it.
01:02:56.958,01:02:59.625,Okay. I gotta go. I gotta go.
01:03:00.250,01:03:01.708,I gotta kiss my wife.
01:03:02.583,01:03:06.666,But you stay here and rest up. And I will be back.
01:03:09.333,01:03:11.791,"It's good to see you, man. I missed you."
01:05:16.125,01:05:18.458,You're only a kid. Hmm?
01:06:22.375,01:06:23.250,Yeah?
01:06:24.916,01:06:28.791,"If you had been killed today, it would have been my fault."
01:06:32.000,01:06:34.750,"No, mate. But it would've been my fault."
01:06:36.666,01:06:38.208,You don't look like a Tyler.
01:06:41.041,01:06:42.208,No?
01:06:42.291,01:06:43.833,What do I look like?
01:06:46.416,01:06:47.250,A Brad.
01:06:51.875,01:06:53.166,Yeah.
01:06:56.500,01:06:58.000,Can I ask you something?
01:06:59.500,01:07:00.500,It's Rake.
01:07:01.250,01:07:03.208,-What's Rake? -My last name.
01:07:04.125,01:07:08.875,"That's not what I was going to ask. That's a strange last name, though."
01:07:10.208,01:07:12.125,Isn't that like a gardening tool?
01:07:16.375,01:07:17.500,What were you gonna ask me?
01:07:19.666,01:07:25.666,If you were always this way. You know... brave.
01:07:26.291,01:07:27.666,"I'm not brave, mate."
01:07:29.500,01:07:33.291,Of course you are. You rescue people.
01:07:34.666,01:07:38.666,"Yeah, sometimes. Sometimes I do other things."
01:07:41.625,01:07:42.875,Like killing people?
01:07:45.958,01:07:47.041,Yeah.
01:07:48.333,01:07:51.166,"My father, he kills people, too."
01:07:53.000,01:08:02.750,"Sometimes, I would sit with him at dinner, look at him and think, he just killed somebody else's father that day."
01:08:04.541,01:08:06.083,And I'd feel sick.
01:08:25.041,01:08:26.458,You have a family?
01:08:29.000,01:08:31.333,I did have me a wife.
01:08:32.083,01:08:33.291,Where is she?
01:08:34.208,01:08:37.791,I don't know. I haven't seen her in a long time.
01:08:39.750,01:08:41.083,Children?
01:08:43.333,01:08:44.625,"Yeah, a son."
01:08:45.958,01:08:47.208,Where is he?
01:08:53.375,01:08:55.208,He died a few years ago.
01:08:58.500,01:08:59.625,How did he die?
01:09:02.041,01:09:03.041,Lymphoma.
01:09:12.041,01:09:13.291,How old was he?
01:09:16.750,01:09:18.041,Six.
01:09:26.916,01:09:30.875,I wasn't even there... when he died.
01:09:33.333,01:09:34.750,Where were you?
01:09:37.000,01:09:40.125,"Kandahar, Afghanistan. It was my third tour."
01:09:42.208,01:09:43.375,You were called away?
01:09:52.250,01:09:53.583,No.
01:09:57.875,01:09:59.000,I left.
01:10:01.833,01:10:02.958,Voluntary.
01:10:07.875,01:10:09.250,Because you couldn't watch?
01:10:15.125,01:10:15.958,Yep.
01:10:23.250,01:10:25.625,"I told you, mate. I'm not brave. I'm just..."
01:10:27.500,01:10:28.916,I'm just the opposite.
01:10:32.458,01:10:33.583,You know...
01:10:36.875,01:10:45.291,"You drown not by falling into the river, but by staying submerged in it."
01:10:49.541,01:10:50.916,Who told you that?
01:10:52.083,01:10:53.750,I read it in a book in school.
01:11:38.416,01:11:39.916,It's the best dove hunting in Argentina.
01:11:40.583,01:11:44.208,Just lie in this pool... You lie in a pool and they fly around!
01:11:48.541,01:11:50.166,And you sip a Cuba Libre.
01:11:51.208,01:11:55.458,I shot my first dove when I was ten years old. Have I told you this?
01:11:55.541,01:11:57.416,-I haven't. Listen. -I think you have.
01:11:57.500,01:12:05.000,"No. It was when I was ten years old, my dad... My dad... The gun backfired, gave me a black eye, and my dad laughs at me."
01:12:05.083,01:12:09.500,"I used to move so quick, kill those little shits."
01:12:10.541,01:12:11.875,"Not anymore, though."
01:12:12.500,01:12:14.916,"It sucks getting old, man. Sucks!"
01:12:20.083,01:12:21.250,I think he's still asleep.
01:12:25.500,01:12:28.291,"What a goddamn tragedy, hmm?"
01:12:31.416,01:12:33.666,That kid is a walking corpse.
01:12:40.416,01:12:42.083,Asif will never let him live.
01:12:44.041,01:12:45.291,Think the disgrace.
01:12:46.375,01:12:51.166,"I mean, you get him home. And then, what? His father's in prison."
01:12:52.041,01:12:53.875,There's no way to protect him.
01:12:57.666,01:13:04.958,"You know, the best thing you could do, honestly, would be to go up there right now and just go put a bullet in his brain."
01:13:05.041,01:13:06.250,Make it painless.
01:13:08.000,01:13:12.916,"'Cause the animals out there, they're not gonna be... as kind to him."
01:13:15.000,01:13:16.958,They like to start with the ears.
01:13:17.875,01:13:20.666,Then they cut off each finger at the joint.
01:13:20.750,01:13:22.375,"Mate, you're drunk."
01:13:25.333,01:13:27.416,"I'm talking about mercy, Tyler."
01:13:36.250,01:13:37.791,You know how much he's worth?
01:13:39.250,01:13:40.541,"We're talking about a kid, Gaspar."
01:13:40.625,01:13:42.750,We're talking about a gangster's kid.
01:13:44.791,01:13:46.541,With a price tag of ten million on his head.
01:13:46.625,01:13:48.166,"You need to sober up, mate."
01:13:49.541,01:13:53.875,"You're a mercenary, right, Tyler? Why don't you act the mercenary?"
01:13:54.833,01:13:57.875,Aren't you sick of this life? 'Cause I am and I...
01:13:58.833,01:14:05.416,I do not wanna end it playing hero on some goddamn suicide mission-- What are you doing? You said you'd help me.
01:14:05.500,01:14:09.000,I am helping you. Ten million dollars.
01:14:10.541,01:14:12.333,I'll get you to the border in a couple hours.
01:14:12.416,01:14:16.708,It's money in your pocket. I take care of the body. Painless.
01:14:16.791,01:14:18.583,And it's the best that that kid can hope for.
01:14:24.041,01:14:33.416,Why are you such a hypocrite? You've got the blood of a hundred men on your hands-- What'd you do?
01:14:33.500,01:14:37.000,Do you know happens to me if they find out that I'm helping you?
01:14:37.083,01:14:39.083,Do you know what happens to my wife?
01:14:40.625,01:14:41.583,Asif's a friend.
01:14:42.916,01:14:45.916,I did some work for him. We made a deal.
01:14:46.000,01:14:49.958,"He gets the kid, you get your freedom, and we both get rich."
01:14:50.041,01:14:53.625,What do you want from me? You want me to walk upstairs and shoot him in the head?
01:14:53.708,01:14:57.375,No. No. I'll do it.
01:15:03.416,01:15:04.250,Don't do this.
01:15:04.333,01:15:06.041,You saved my life once.
01:15:08.458,01:15:09.666,Now I'm gonna save yours.
01:15:12.250,01:15:13.375,Step aside.
01:15:39.250,01:15:40.500,"Tyler, stop!"
01:16:00.333,01:16:02.333,"What are we doing, man? Huh?"
01:16:04.166,01:16:05.500,"Come on, stay down."
01:16:06.125,01:16:07.250,Stay down.
01:16:26.291,01:16:27.458,"Hey, kid."
01:16:39.041,01:16:41.875,I know it looks bad. I know it looks bad.
01:18:19.750,01:18:20.958,"I'll get you home, mate."
01:18:26.458,01:18:27.916,I'll get you home.
01:19:21.958,01:19:22.791,Stay here.
01:19:57.625,01:19:58.458,Just like that?
01:19:59.250,01:20:00.708,"Yeah, just like that."
01:20:01.375,01:20:03.708,I want the boy out of here. That's all I care about.
01:20:05.208,01:20:06.041,Why?
01:20:07.375,01:20:08.458,'Cause I do.
01:20:13.041,01:20:15.875,He was gonna kill my family if I didn't get his son back.
01:20:26.833,01:20:30.583,My people are waiting for him on the other side of the Sultana Kamal bridge.
01:20:30.666,01:20:33.000,There's two blockades between here and there.
01:20:33.083,01:20:34.833,I'll do my best to draw them away from both.
01:20:45.083,01:20:46.583,You get him to the other side.
01:20:55.208,01:20:56.083,Tyler.
01:21:00.375,01:21:01.333,"See you soon, mate."
01:21:50.958,01:21:51.875,Do you trust him?
01:21:53.625,01:21:54.458,I do.
01:22:04.041,01:22:05.083,Seat belt.
01:22:46.375,01:22:47.708,"Go, go, go!"
01:24:34.250,01:24:36.708,"You can't go. I'm telling you, you can't go."
01:25:01.000,01:25:02.625,"Hey, stop!"
01:25:19.000,01:25:20.458,Take off your cap.
01:27:23.875,01:27:24.708,Go.
01:28:35.958,01:28:37.875,"Rake, I need you on the bridge!"
01:28:38.875,01:28:39.958,"Yeah, on my way."
01:28:41.958,01:30:31.291,"Oh, sh-- Where's the kid?"
01:30:33.583,01:30:34.958,I'm trying to clear a path.
01:30:39.541,01:30:41.375,"Yaz, where are you?"
01:30:42.083,01:30:43.083,Two minutes out.
01:32:57.791,01:33:02.041,Fuck! I'm taking fire. Abort. I'm going around.
01:36:06.583,01:36:08.041,You see that helicopter?
01:36:12.083,01:36:15.708,I need you to run as fast as you can for it.
01:36:16.708,01:36:19.541,"No. Please. Please, get up."
01:36:35.833,01:36:36.666,Go.
01:36:37.708,01:36:40.291,-Please... -Run.
01:36:42.375,01:36:43.208,Run!
