00:00:32.741,00:00:34.702,"Welcome back, a cappella enthusiasts."
00:00:34.702,00:00:39.331,My name is John Smith and sitting here to my left is Gail Abernathy- McKadden-Feinberger.
00:00:39.331,00:00:41.082,"Oh, this one's gonna stick, John."
00:00:41.082,00:00:43.084,"-Well, you saved the Jew for last."
00:00:43.084,00:00:47.756,"You're listening to Let's Talk-appella, the world's premier downloadable a cappella podcast."
00:00:47.756,00:00:54.179,We are coming to you live from the nation's capital where the Barden University Bellas are about to rock the historic Kennedy Center.
00:00:54.179,00:00:59.100,"Boy, these girls have broken down every single barrier in their path, - haven't they, Gail?"
00:00:59.100,00:01:07.735,"The first all-female group to win a national title, three-time defending champs, and now here they are performing for the President of the United States on his birthday."
00:01:07.735,00:01:13.032,"Oh, wow, what an inspiration to girls all over the country who are too ugly to be cheerleaders."
00:01:58.077,00:02:00.079,"Here's Beca Mitchell, leader of the group."
00:02:00.079,00:02:03.123,"Look at these sequins and sparkles. Oh, my!"
00:02:03.123,00:02:05.626,Their feet just don't stop moving.
00:02:23.184,00:02:36.115,"she say she won't, Ooh, Florencia Fuentes just earned her green card, John."
00:02:36.115,00:02:39.451,She may have to do that backflip right back over the fence into Mexico.
00:02:39.451,00:02:42.287,-I think she's Guatemalan.
00:02:42.287,00:02:46.207,"There is so much happening onstage, I don't even know where to look."
00:02:46.207,00:02:49.753,"Back in my day, we put on our blazers and we just sang."
00:02:49.753,00:02:52.213,We maybe snapped our fingers if we were feeling frisky.
00:03:05.268,00:03:08.229,surprise!
00:03:08.229,00:03:10.649,An overweight girl dangling from the ceiling.
00:03:10.649,00:03:13.152,-Who hasn't had that dream?
00:03:31.419,00:03:34.840,Whoa!
00:03:38.552,00:03:40.387,no underwear on.
00:03:40.387,00:03:42.263,"-Oh, my God!"
00:03:42.263,00:03:44.641,There is a commando situation onstage!
00:03:44.641,00:03:47.644,Who is on top of this?
00:03:49.479,00:03:51.272,-She's turning.
00:03:51.272,00:03:53.067,-Brace yourselves.
00:03:53.067,00:03:54.818,Avert your eyes or take it all in!
00:03:54.818,00:03:56.361,-Make your choice!
00:03:56.361,00:03:58.238,-Nobody wants to see the front.
00:04:01.449,00:04:04.285,"Happy birthday, Mr. President."
00:04:04.285,00:04:12.293,The Australian singer who calls herself Fat Amy gave the president a birthday gift from down under during last night's celebration held at the historic Kennedy Center.
00:04:12.293,00:04:18.800,"In case you're wondering what I mean by down under, -Chip, I'm talking about her -- She showed her -- to the president."
00:04:22.429,00:04:26.016,All eyes were on the a cappella singers the Barden Bellas.
00:04:26.016,00:04:32.355,"...three-time defending a cappella national champions, which is a real thing, apparently."
00:04:32.355,00:04:39.320,"Although authorities have ruled out terrorism as a motive, the Bellas claimed the mishap was merely an accident and issued an apology."
00:04:39.320,00:04:43.951,I am deeply sorry for the upset that I have caused.
00:04:43.951,00:04:50.958,I feel that I have already received punishment enough in the form of silk burn.
00:04:50.958,00:04:53.585,-Exhibit C.
00:04:53.585,00:04:54.795,It's filth.
00:04:54.795,00:04:59.258,Women who sing are just another example of cultural decay due to loose morals.
00:04:59.258,00:05:02.177,-Not wearing underwear seems kind of intentional to me.
00:05:02.177,00:05:06.347,"Yeah, you either choose to wear underwear -or you don't wear underwear."
00:05:06.347,00:05:11.352,"You know, until today, I thought singing a cappella -was the most embarrassing thing you could do."
00:05:11.352,00:05:17.358,"Normally that group is on point, and last night they were off point, -off-key, and then on the floor."
00:05:17.358,00:05:20.361,"Yeah, but I'd rather be in that limo ride home with the president."
00:05:20.361,00:05:24.283,"Cut to the real president, he'd be like, That -- was off the hook!"
00:05:51.643,00:05:53.478,"-Chloe, chill out."
00:05:53.478,00:05:55.480,It was a mistake.
00:05:55.480,00:06:00.652,"No, but the National A Cappella Association is in there talking to the dean about us, and who knows what's gonna happen?"
00:06:00.652,00:06:02.321,We've won three championships.
00:06:02.321,00:06:04.031,"Whatever happens in there, we're gonna be fine."
00:06:04.031,00:06:06.700,Maybe it's time to think about other stuff.
00:06:06.700,00:06:08.202,What other stuff?
00:06:08.202,00:06:10.745,"You know, school, jobs, life."
00:06:10.745,00:06:12.580,This group is my life.
00:06:12.580,00:06:15.876,I've intentionally failed Russian Lit three times so I could be a Bella.
00:06:15.876,00:06:20.588,This is the worst thing that's ever happened to us.
00:06:20.588,00:06:24.926,"You know, before coming to Barden, I had diarrhea for seven years."
00:06:26.220,00:06:29.430,"But, yes, this is terrible."
00:06:29.430,00:06:32.391,The dean is ready for you tramps.
00:06:32.391,00:06:34.853,"Oh, jeez."
00:06:34.853,00:06:40.359,"Ladies, you have dragged the good name of Barden University into the gutter."
00:06:40.359,00:06:45.739,And you've really upset these people whose-- whose names I've already forgotten.
00:06:45.739,00:06:52.037,Your little southern exposure in front of our commander-in-chief has irreparably damaged the entire institution of a cappella.
00:06:52.037,00:06:54.248,-Just blew it up.
00:06:54.248,00:06:56.375,-Sponsors are pulling out.
00:06:56.375,00:06:58.126,"Unfortunately, an example must be made."
00:06:58.126,00:07:03.257,It is the decision of this governing body -that the Bellas are hereby suspended...
00:07:03.257,00:07:05.466,-from competing at the collegiate level.
00:07:05.466,00:07:08.762,The terms of your suspension are laid out in this document.
00:07:08.762,00:07:11.139,"I'm sorry, but it's over."
00:07:11.139,00:07:13.058,"Okay, can we be reasonable?"
00:07:13.058,00:07:16.270,-Fat Amy apologized.
00:07:16.270,00:07:19.480,You're taking us off our victory tour?
00:07:19.480,00:07:21.900,Who's gonna sing the national anthem at the Puppy Bowl?
00:07:21.900,00:07:27.281,"You're being replaced by the European champions, -a German group of total professionals."
00:07:27.281,00:07:29.241,"In other words, they're gonna keep their pants on."
00:07:29.241,00:07:33.494,So we can't defend our title and we can't tour-- And you can't hold any auditions.
00:07:33.494,00:07:36.497,We don't need your ranks to grow like a fungus.
00:07:36.497,00:07:39.834,"Oh, so that's it, then?"
00:07:39.834,00:07:44.505,"Look, ladies, I'm sorry that this disciplinary action has shocked you."
00:07:44.505,00:07:46.549,Especially since you're all seniors.
00:07:46.549,00:07:50.511,-But the truth is you're just women.
00:07:50.511,00:07:52.847,-And you'll all be pregnant soon.
00:07:54.933,00:07:56.559,"Mom, I'm late."
00:07:56.559,00:07:58.686,It's orientation.
00:07:58.686,00:08:00.814,"Oh, I can't."
00:08:00.814,00:08:02.774,-I just can't do it.
00:08:02.774,00:08:05.402,My only daughter leaving the nest.
00:08:09.864,00:08:16.830,the biggest part -Mom.
00:08:16.830,00:08:19.124,-Or I could keep singing.
00:08:16.830,00:08:21.542,"-You know, I don't know how I'm gonna get by -without your spontaneous singing."
00:08:21.542,00:08:24.545,"Oh, honey, you're gonna love this place."
00:08:24.545,00:08:26.214,Just promise you'll call.
00:08:26.214,00:08:32.095,"Oh, and, honey, don't be afraid to express yourself, and not with those weird buttons they wear in their earlobes."
00:08:32.095,00:08:33.930,-Unless you're gonna get a job-- -Slow down.
00:08:33.930,00:08:35.556,I'm not gonna do anything crazy.
00:08:35.556,00:08:38.018,I'm just gonna write my songs and join an a cappella group.
00:08:38.018,00:08:40.979,Not just any a cappella group.
00:08:40.979,00:08:43.564,The Bellas are an institution.
00:08:43.564,00:08:46.776,-My days as a Bella were the...
00:08:46.776,00:08:49.988,I know.
00:08:49.988,00:08:51.948,"Unless they don't take me, Mom."
00:08:51.948,00:08:54.368,"Oh, no, no. No, honey, they're gonna take you."
00:08:54.368,00:08:56.577,"Thanks to me, you were born into it."
00:08:56.577,00:09:01.582,And then I'm gonna be your mother and your sister.
00:09:01.582,00:09:03.960,Gross. Okay.
00:09:05.586,00:09:08.215,"All right, the next phase of my life..."
00:09:09.590,00:09:11.301,begins.
00:09:11.301,00:09:14.721,"Hold on, there's nothing in here that strips us of our national title."
00:09:14.721,00:09:20.601,"And if we're still reigning champs, then we are automatically invited to represent America at the World Championships this spring."
00:09:20.601,00:09:27.608,"Ah, yes, the World Championships of A Cappella, where every four years groups from around the globe compete for world domination."
00:09:27.608,00:09:29.652,"I'm sorry, I just feel like I always have to be on."
00:09:29.652,00:09:31.612,-You know?
00:09:29.652,00:09:35.367,"Well, look, ladies, we can't stop you from going to the Worlds competition."
00:09:35.367,00:09:37.035,It's not gonna help your case here.
00:09:37.035,00:09:39.620,-What if we win it?
00:09:39.620,00:09:41.622,-What if you win it?
00:09:41.622,00:09:46.127,Like you-- you outperform the other groups?
00:09:46.127,00:09:49.464,Oh-ho-ho!
00:09:49.464,00:09:53.260,How do you fit such big dreams in such a small body?
00:09:53.260,00:09:54.802,What if you win it?
00:09:59.099,00:10:01.560,-It's never...
00:09:59.099,00:10:04.187,-What if-- -What if you win it?
00:10:04.187,00:10:08.024,"Sure, but no American team has ever won."
00:10:08.024,00:10:10.651,That's because they hate us.
00:10:10.651,00:10:14.655,-The whole world.
00:10:14.655,00:10:17.367,"Hello, fresh-persons!"
00:10:17.367,00:10:20.454,Welcome to Barden University!
00:10:24.665,00:10:27.668,"Okay, the-- the Barden Knight."
00:10:27.668,00:10:29.296,No one cares about you.
00:10:29.296,00:10:32.882,You have made a great choice and a cheap one.
00:10:32.882,00:10:35.676,"Yay, Barden!"
00:10:35.676,00:10:44.685,"We have a very special performance for you guys today, the pride and joy of Barden University, The Tre-bla-muckers!"
00:10:46.480,00:10:48.898,"Thank you, thank you, thank you."
00:10:48.898,00:10:50.817,We are the Treblemakers.
00:10:50.817,00:10:53.111,I'm Jesse and this is a cappella.
00:11:54.755,00:11:58.552,-Someone drop some bass.
00:11:58.552,00:12:00.345,"Mm-hmm, now I need some baritone."
00:12:43.513,00:12:44.972,All right!
00:12:44.972,00:12:47.850,"Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God."
00:12:47.850,00:12:49.810,"Chloe, don't blame yourself."
00:12:49.810,00:12:51.812,You're a ginger.
00:12:51.812,00:12:53.814,-This is not all your fault.
00:12:53.814,00:12:55.316,This is on all of us.
00:12:55.316,00:12:57.110,"So if we don't win the Worlds, then what are we?"
00:12:57.110,00:12:59.279,Just a bunch of girls that hang out?
00:12:59.279,00:13:00.614,What's wrong with that?
00:13:00.614,00:13:02.781,"If we don't win, the Bellas are over."
00:13:02.781,00:13:05.826,- This is the biggest challenge that any of us have ever faced.
00:13:05.826,00:13:10.749,"When I was nine years old, my brother tried to sell me for a chicken, so..."
00:13:10.749,00:13:13.834,"Well, I will do whoever it takes in order for us to get back to the top."
00:13:13.834,00:13:15.002,You mean whatever it takes.
00:13:15.002,00:13:16.296,"Yeah, I'll do that, too."
00:13:16.296,00:13:17.880,That's great news.
00:13:17.880,00:13:20.049,"Yes. No, I can start Monday."
00:13:20.049,00:13:25.096,"I'm--I would be stoked to start on Mon-- Sorry, I don't say stoked."
00:13:25.096,00:13:27.223,"I'm, like-- I'm pretty cool."
00:13:27.223,00:13:28.849,"That was bad, too."
00:13:28.849,00:13:31.394,We need to attack this problem head-on.
00:13:31.394,00:13:34.439,"I want 100% commitment and laser focus, right?"
00:13:34.439,00:13:37.567,-Great.
00:13:37.567,00:13:39.360,Beca out.
00:13:39.360,00:13:41.862,-Beca!
00:13:41.862,00:13:44.365,-Yeah.
00:13:44.365,00:13:45.866,It's a tiki party.
00:13:45.866,00:13:47.535,You guys don't even have to wear shoes.
00:13:47.535,00:13:49.870,It's the best kind of party.
00:13:49.870,00:13:51.289,Here you go.
00:13:51.289,00:13:54.083,"Hey, great job, Trebles."
00:13:54.083,00:13:56.877,"Oh, thank you."
00:13:56.877,00:13:59.631,"Oh, yeah. I've got my heart set on being a Bella."
00:13:59.631,00:14:01.800,It's actually at the very top of all my dream boards.
00:14:01.800,00:14:05.052,Did I hear mention of dreams?
00:14:05.052,00:14:08.431,"Hello, I just have to say you are so spirited."
00:14:08.431,00:14:11.184,I-- I just wanna put you in a box and saw you in half.
00:14:11.184,00:14:12.893,For magic.
00:14:12.893,00:14:14.395,As a part of a trick.
00:14:14.395,00:14:16.147,-He does magic.
00:14:16.147,00:14:18.358,It's only weird if you don't embrace it.
00:14:18.358,00:14:21.319,"-Dude, explain yourself."
00:14:21.319,00:14:22.903,"-How'd I do, man?"
00:14:22.903,00:14:24.905,-I've seen you do worse.
00:14:28.993,00:14:32.038,It's been months and we're still getting hate mail?
00:14:32.038,00:14:33.456,Sucks.
00:14:33.456,00:14:35.166,For your hairy situation?
00:14:36.626,00:14:38.461,-Oh.
00:14:38.461,00:14:40.505,We are officially registered.
00:14:40.505,00:14:47.554,"Update your passports, ladies, because we are going to the very sunny, very beautiful Copenhagen."
00:14:47.554,00:14:49.889,-Nice!
00:14:52.141,00:14:53.393,Where is that?
00:14:53.393,00:14:54.935,I don't know.
00:14:54.935,00:14:59.940,It looks like the competition has been dominated by that stupid German group that took over our tour.
00:14:59.940,00:15:02.610,-You mean stole our tour.
00:15:02.610,00:15:05.488,-We need to scout those Deutsch-bags.
00:15:05.488,00:15:07.114,But how good can they be?
00:15:07.114,00:15:10.159,Germany hasn't produced a good singer since David Hasselhoff.
00:15:10.159,00:15:12.412,We're gonna crush them!
00:15:12.412,00:15:18.710,"And when we do, we can stick it to these chumps who send us all this hate mail, like Sonia Sotomayor."
00:15:20.127,00:15:21.588,Judgy bitch.
00:15:21.588,00:15:24.965,-The Bellas are back!
00:15:24.965,00:15:28.010,-Whoo!
00:15:28.010,00:15:30.597,"So, any first-day jitters?"
00:15:30.597,00:15:32.766,"No, no. You know, I'm just gonna be moody and distant."
00:15:32.766,00:15:34.934,-Artists love that.
00:15:34.934,00:15:36.811,Here you go.
00:15:36.811,00:15:37.687,Okay.
00:15:39.146,00:15:40.607,"Dude, why do I feel so guilty?"
00:15:40.607,00:15:41.982,"I've given a lot to the Bellas, right?"
00:15:41.982,00:15:43.568,"It's, like, three years of my life."
00:15:43.568,00:15:47.280,"Yeah. Bec, you should not feel guilty at all about taking your shot."
00:15:47.280,00:15:48.989,"-This is a big deal, right?"
00:15:48.989,00:15:51.409,-It is a very big deal.
00:15:51.409,00:15:53.327,-Go.
00:15:55.705,00:15:57.457,Nothing's gonna stop my girl!
00:15:57.457,00:15:58.999,I don't know him.
00:15:58.999,00:16:01.795,"-Becs in effects, y'all."
00:16:06.800,00:16:40.750,"-Are you ready or-- you go great, you never Okay, everybody, huddle up."
00:16:40.750,00:16:42.335,"Let's go, let's go, let's go!"
00:16:42.335,00:16:44.963,"Get up, come on."
00:16:44.963,00:16:49.258,Last one at this table has to help Frank watch YouTube videos to find the next Justin Bieber.
00:16:49.258,00:16:53.053,"Hey, so I'm turning 25 next week if anybody wants to get some drinks, celebrate."
00:16:53.053,00:16:57.057,"Frank, buddy, less talk."
00:16:57.057,00:16:59.226,"Okay, my people, check it out."
00:17:00.311,00:17:01.521,That...
00:17:02.647,00:17:04.941,"This-- Dax, with the tech guy."
00:17:04.941,00:17:07.193,-Did you call the tech guy?
00:17:07.193,00:17:10.822,Do you understand that everything else in my life works?
00:17:10.822,00:17:12.072,Uh-huh.
00:17:12.072,00:17:14.074,"So I just need everything here to work, too."
00:17:14.074,00:17:15.409,-Okay?
00:17:15.409,00:17:17.161,"Oh, my God."
00:17:17.161,00:17:20.080,-You want me to call him now?
00:17:20.080,00:17:21.415,Okay.
00:17:22.416,00:17:23.751,There we go.
00:17:23.751,00:17:26.004,That is the lion himself.
00:17:26.004,00:17:32.468,That is the legendary Snoop D-O-double-G singing White Christmas at a tree-lighting ceremony in Moscow.
00:17:32.468,00:17:38.641,And he was so moved by the power of music to unite the world or some shit that now he wants to drop his own cool Christmas album.
00:17:38.641,00:17:43.270,"And because I sleep on a bed of Grammys, he has decided to hire me to produce it."
00:17:43.270,00:17:45.857,-Now-- -But Snoop Dogg already dropped a Christmas album.
00:17:45.857,00:17:55.115,"If you had listened to the album like I did, stranded in the air with T.I. on a golden hang glider, then you would've known that none of the songs were the classics."
00:17:55.115,00:17:59.996,I've had to listen to that album on two separate occasions-- hang gliding with T.I.
00:17:59.996,00:18:03.082,and also a rocket ship that Eminem has built.
00:18:03.082,00:18:06.836,"It doesn't go anywhere, but he's got dreams for it, okay?"
00:18:06.836,00:18:09.129,So need you to close your mouth.
00:18:09.129,00:18:11.131,"Herein lies the problem, everybody."
00:18:11.131,00:18:17.055,"Last time I checked, there are over a million Christmas albums with the same 10 damn songs on them."
00:18:17.055,00:18:24.604,"So, guys, I'm telling you, man, I need all hands on deck right now to come up with ideas on how to make this one stand out."
00:18:24.604,00:18:26.564,"Okay, you got it?"
00:18:26.564,00:18:28.148,Fire when ready.
00:18:28.148,00:18:30.068,Anything?
00:18:30.068,00:18:31.402,Anybody?
00:18:31.402,00:18:33.029,Anybody right now would be great.
00:18:33.029,00:18:36.074,-Anybody to talk-- -What if we got those dogs-- Anybody but you.
00:18:36.074,00:18:40.202,What if we got those dogs that bark Jingle Bells -to back him up?
00:18:40.202,00:18:44.916,"Let me guess, you want those dogs to back him up -because he's Snoop Dogg?"
00:18:44.916,00:18:49.003,That is a really great example of a horrible idea.
00:18:50.630,00:18:54.008,-Take a lap.
00:18:54.008,00:18:56.343,-Take a lap.
00:18:56.343,00:18:58.554,I don't care.
00:18:58.554,00:19:01.099,Let's go.
00:19:01.099,00:19:03.183,"Knees up, please."
00:19:03.183,00:19:05.770,"Guys, I should give you a little more time."
00:19:05.770,00:19:07.187,You got one minute.
00:19:07.187,00:19:09.941,"My time is like a toddler in a tiara, okay?"
00:19:09.941,00:19:12.276,Precious and short.
00:19:12.276,00:19:14.361,Snoop is coming.
00:19:26.206,00:19:28.375,"Oh, sorry, my boobs are all crazy."
00:19:28.375,00:19:29.543,I was just jumping.
00:19:29.543,00:19:31.712,"Uh, I, um, just came from auditions."
00:19:31.712,00:19:35.215,You guys weren't there. I-- I was hoping for the chance to sing for you.
00:19:35.215,00:19:36.509,"No, can't help you."
00:19:36.509,00:19:38.260,We're not allowed to take anyone else new.
00:19:38.260,00:19:39.386,"Oh, no, no, no, wait, wait!"
00:19:39.386,00:19:41.097,I-- I'm a Junk!
00:19:41.097,00:19:43.099,What did you say about your junk?
00:19:44.224,00:19:45.768,I'm Emily Junk.
00:19:45.768,00:19:47.812,I know it's weird.
00:19:47.812,00:19:49.689,"My dad's last name was Hardon, so..."
00:19:51.273,00:19:53.151,Um...
00:19:54.986,00:19:55.987,I'm a legacy.
00:19:55.987,00:19:59.239,Junk. Junk.
00:19:59.239,00:20:01.868,Your mother is Katherine Junk?
00:20:01.868,00:20:05.245,-Who?
00:20:05.245,00:20:07.790,She pioneered the syncopated booty shake.
00:20:07.790,00:20:10.250,And word is she has a five-octave vocal range.
00:20:10.250,00:20:12.086,"Oh, still does."
00:20:12.086,00:20:14.380,You do not wanna hear that woman doing it with my dad. Whoo!
00:20:14.380,00:20:16.256,What an odd thing to say.
00:20:16.256,00:20:19.969,"True. If a legacy wants to audition, we have to let her."
00:20:19.969,00:20:22.471,"Okay, um..."
00:20:23.764,00:20:25.265,Show us what you got.
00:20:25.265,00:20:27.601,Right now? Right here?
00:20:27.601,00:20:29.311,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:29.311,00:20:34.274,"Okay, um, I, uh-- I'd like to perform an original song that I've been working on."
00:20:32.690,00:20:36.527,"Um, I'm not-- I'm not quite finished with it, though, so..."
00:20:36.527,00:20:39.197,let's not be dicks about it.
00:20:39.197,00:20:40.990,"Sorry, that was crass, wasn't it?"
00:20:40.990,00:20:42.533,"Fat Amy, you have a lovely vagina."
00:20:42.533,00:20:44.577,Thank you. Proceed.
00:20:51.291,00:21:13.397,"of the things that That one I'm not-- I'm still kind of tinkering with that verse, so it's not-- nothing's really completely set."
00:21:22.740,00:21:39.840,getting me through Would you excuse us for just one second?
00:21:41.592,00:21:43.219,She's pretty good.
00:21:43.219,00:21:44.637,Can't we take her?
00:21:44.637,00:21:47.056,"Wait, what do you expect us to say?"
00:21:48.891,00:21:50.810,-She's definitely not a soloist.
00:21:50.810,00:21:53.854,"Technically, she came to us, so, really, we're not breaking any rules."
00:21:53.854,00:21:56.941,"Yeah, it's the perfect loophole."
00:21:56.941,00:22:04.991,"You know, it's always good to have an extra body just in case one of us gets kidnapped for ransom, is thrown into a shipping container, and is made to only eat leaves and gas receipts."
00:22:04.991,00:22:07.367,"Mm, I agree."
00:22:07.367,00:22:10.163,I don't think we should decide anything without Beca.
00:22:10.163,00:22:12.331,I keep a penny under my tongue.
00:22:14.000,00:22:17.377,Did anyone else think it was creepy that she never really opened her eyes the whole time?
00:22:17.377,00:22:20.380,"Again, we're talking about her and she's standing right there."
00:22:20.380,00:22:24.260,"-But if we're gonna talk negatives, let's start with the giraffe legs."
00:22:25.552,00:22:27.429,"Okay, let's take a vote on it."
00:22:27.429,00:22:30.432,"Anyone who wants her in, sing a G sharp. Anyone who doesn't, sing an E flat."
00:22:30.432,00:22:31.725,"One, two..."
00:22:39.900,00:22:41.735,I like-- like your shirt.
00:22:43.863,00:22:48.201,-Welcome to the Bellas!
00:22:48.201,00:22:49.660,Whoo!
00:22:49.660,00:22:51.411,"Oh, stop, girl."
00:22:51.411,00:22:53.873,"-Oh! Girl, stop."
00:22:53.873,00:22:56.416,"So, uh-- so when does initiation start?"
00:22:56.416,00:23:02.548,"Tell you what, I'll go back to my dorm and pretend to be surprised when you throw the hood over my head and make me solve a Rubik's Cube while sucking vodka from a maxi pad."
00:23:02.548,00:23:04.342,That's what my mom said happened.
00:23:04.342,00:23:05.425,"Mm, no can do."
00:23:05.425,00:23:06.802,"Well, look around."
00:23:06.802,00:23:08.721,We don't exactly have a maxi pad to spare.
00:23:08.721,00:23:10.223,So...
00:23:10.223,00:23:12.432,"All right, grab your guts, ladies!"
00:23:12.432,00:23:13.976,It's party time!
00:23:13.976,00:23:16.103,We got tickets to Copenhagen and a brand-new Bella!
00:23:18.189,00:23:19.857,Let's go!
00:23:19.857,00:23:22.776,-All right.
00:23:22.776,00:23:24.653,"-Uh, should I, um..."
00:23:24.653,00:23:26.530,-I'm gonna just leave my bag here.
00:23:26.530,00:23:28.448,Let's go get into Trebles!
00:23:28.448,00:23:30.993,Has this bush always been here?
00:23:30.993,00:23:33.162,"there's a gate, right?"
00:23:38.458,00:23:40.711,My first college party.
00:23:40.711,00:23:43.463,"Yeah, well, this isn't just any college party."
00:23:43.463,00:23:45.383,This is a cappella only.
00:23:45.383,00:23:48.719,Yeah. So get prepared to meet a lot of sexually confused men.
00:23:48.719,00:23:51.555,"-Bellas! Welcome, welcome, welcome."
00:23:51.555,00:23:54.474,Jesse! Where is Beca?
00:23:54.474,00:23:56.977,-I thought she was with you.
00:23:59.272,00:24:00.522,Hey!
00:24:00.522,00:24:01.815,"Benji, right?"
00:24:05.652,00:24:08.739,"Oh, those aren't-- those aren't words."
00:24:11.367,00:24:14.494,-I'm sorry?
00:24:14.494,00:24:15.495,The movies?
00:24:15.495,00:24:16.622,Are you asking me out?
00:24:16.622,00:24:19.125,"Nah, it's-- yes."
00:24:19.125,00:24:21.377,"-Oh, that's so sweet."
00:24:21.377,00:24:23.587,It's just my-- it's my first day.
00:24:23.587,00:24:26.506,"-Um, wasn't really planning on rushing in on anything."
00:24:40.813,00:24:42.564,-Hey! Oh!
00:24:42.564,00:24:44.233,-You made it.
00:24:44.233,00:24:46.026,Couldn't miss your last Hood Night party.
00:24:46.026,00:24:47.527,-Oh.
00:24:47.527,00:24:49.613,How was the internship?
00:24:49.613,00:24:51.531,"-Eye-opening, yeah."
00:24:51.531,00:24:54.534,-They do not mess around.
00:24:54.534,00:24:58.331,-Why didn't you tell her?
00:24:58.331,00:25:00.874,"She's, like, locked into the Worlds right now and I'm looking for the right time."
00:25:00.874,00:25:02.293,It's-- I'll tell her.
00:25:02.293,00:25:04.337,Bumper's back!
00:25:04.337,00:25:05.838,Whoo!
00:25:05.838,00:25:07.423,Campus security!
00:25:07.423,00:25:09.549,Bumper! Bumper!
00:25:09.549,00:25:11.385,Fat Amy's back!
00:25:11.385,00:25:13.846,"'Cause I never left, 'cause I'm still here."
00:25:13.846,00:25:19.352,"Whoo! But I'm back, so it's a big deal because I've arrived again."
00:25:19.352,00:25:23.314,"You know, for someone who left school years ago, you're harder to shake than mono."
00:25:24.357,00:25:27.401,I've got some pretty big news.
00:25:27.401,00:25:30.904,-What?
00:25:27.401,00:25:37.577,-I have been hand-plucked to be put on a waiting list to be put on a very well-known TV singing competition.
00:25:37.577,00:25:39.746,-Really?
00:25:39.746,00:25:41.581,"Oh, Bumper."
00:25:41.581,00:25:44.502,"-You shut your face and kiss me, Bumper."
00:25:44.502,00:25:47.921,"-Bumper, please just shut your trap."
00:25:47.921,00:25:49.798,You talk exactly like this.
00:25:49.798,00:25:51.467,-Do not.
00:25:51.467,00:25:54.053,I d-- I don't.
00:25:54.053,00:25:55.595,-So shut up.
00:25:57.597,00:25:59.099,Yeah!
00:26:06.648,00:26:08.275,Hi!
00:26:08.275,00:26:09.360,Hi.
00:26:09.360,00:26:13.613,I am so excited to meet the woman who single-handedly created the Bella sound.
00:26:13.613,00:26:16.616,We're sisters!
00:26:16.616,00:26:18.160,"-Oh! Yeah, hi."
00:26:18.160,00:26:19.619,Chloe texted me we added a legacy.
00:26:19.619,00:26:21.621,I didn't even know that was a thing.
00:26:49.858,00:26:51.651,"-Shh, let's go!"
00:27:03.621,00:27:05.832,Remind me again why we are at a car show.
00:27:05.832,00:27:09.669,We're here for one reason and one reason only-- to scout the competition.
00:27:09.669,00:27:12.672,It's totally gonna help us win the Worlds if we know what we're up against.
00:27:12.672,00:27:17.303,"All right, now where are those tour thieves?"
00:27:17.303,00:27:20.097,-Stacie!
00:27:20.097,00:27:21.681,-Stacie!
00:27:23.392,00:27:24.684,What the...?
00:27:24.684,00:27:27.687,This all should've been ours.
00:27:27.687,00:27:29.689,I hate these Germans.
00:27:31.275,00:27:33.360,Holy a-ca-moley!
00:27:33.360,00:27:36.447,"Okay, the cars moved."
00:27:36.447,00:27:40.075,But they're moving backwards with ghosts driving them.
00:27:42.702,00:27:52.045,"We are-- we are Das Sound Machine, a German collective operating in concert to create sonic-- sonic mastery."
00:27:52.045,00:27:55.924,What better way to appreciate automotive perfection?
00:28:41.761,00:29:05.035,"to keep us trapped wrapped around Man, they massive!"
00:29:05.035,00:29:06.786,"Yeah, they're so freaking in sync."
00:29:44.824,00:29:46.660,Do we clap?
00:29:46.660,00:29:48.787,-Clap. Do we clap?
00:29:48.787,00:29:51.790,- Danke schön.
00:29:57.588,00:29:58.880,Barden Bellas.
00:29:58.880,00:30:00.840,You came here to see us?
00:30:00.840,00:30:02.384,Is it because you are...
00:30:02.384,00:30:04.844,"what do the American kids say, jelly?"
00:30:04.844,00:30:07.514,We are so not jelly.
00:30:07.514,00:30:11.059,We should really thank you for making this tour a reality.
00:30:11.059,00:30:13.228,"You know, with your bumbling ineptitude."
00:30:13.228,00:30:15.855,We should send them something. Fruit basket?
00:30:15.855,00:30:17.190,Yum-yum.
00:30:17.190,00:30:19.318,Or would you prefer mini muffins?
00:30:19.318,00:30:21.861,"Okay, we didn't come here to start something with you guys."
00:30:21.861,00:30:25.407,We just wanted to check you out before the Worlds where we're gonna kick your ass.
00:30:27.493,00:30:29.161,You?
00:30:29.161,00:30:31.871,You are the kicker of ass?
00:30:31.871,00:30:33.873,"-Well, yeah."
00:30:33.873,00:30:35.875,You are so tiny.
00:30:35.875,00:30:39.421,Like an elf.
00:30:39.421,00:30:41.923,-Troll.
00:30:41.923,00:30:44.468,That's it.
00:30:44.468,00:30:45.927,You...
00:30:45.927,00:30:48.764,are physically flawless.
00:30:48.764,00:30:51.600,-Thank you.
00:30:53.560,00:30:59.608,"We are not scared about the Worlds because when the Bellas hit the stage, -we are gonna blow minds."
00:30:59.608,00:31:02.444,More of Flabby Abby's baby chute?
00:31:02.444,00:31:04.029,That's not my name.
00:31:04.029,00:31:06.198,I don't know your name.
00:31:06.198,00:31:09.909,Obese Denise.
00:31:09.909,00:31:15.457,"Mein name ist Fat Amy, und I eat Krauts like you for lunch."
00:31:15.457,00:31:18.001,Your team is like a-- how do you say that?
00:31:18.001,00:31:19.753,"Uh, a heated mess."
00:31:19.753,00:31:26.510,"You know, a mess where heat is applied to it, so what once was a little messy is now even messier."
00:31:26.510,00:31:29.471,"Darlings, please take my advice."
00:31:29.471,00:31:31.181,Don't try to beat us.
00:31:31.181,00:31:32.766,You can't.
00:31:32.766,00:31:33.933,We're the best.
00:31:33.933,00:31:36.436,And now I really must go rest my neck.
00:31:36.436,00:31:39.022,It is sore from looking down on you.
00:31:39.022,00:31:45.278,"Okay, just because you are making me very sexually confused does not mean that you are intimidating."
00:31:45.278,00:31:46.946,We have nothing to lose.
00:31:46.946,00:31:49.491,-We have literally nothing.
00:31:49.491,00:31:51.076,"A-ca-wiedersehen, bitches!"
00:31:51.076,00:31:53.871,"Oh, what is happening?"
00:31:53.871,00:31:55.997,"-All right, ladies, focus up."
00:31:55.997,00:31:59.543,-We need to beat those German dummkopfs.
00:31:59.543,00:32:01.503,"Okay, we're gonna beat DSM at their own game."
00:32:01.503,00:32:03.171,"Do what they do, just better."
00:32:03.171,00:32:06.966,And we're about to do a full skills assessment to blow out our choreography to match.
00:32:06.966,00:32:10.679,"But the important thing is that we have fun, right?"
00:32:10.679,00:32:16.309,"Uh, legacy, don't take this the wrong way, but you're the dumbest person alive."
00:32:27.571,00:32:29.782,-And you're a cat.
00:33:06.025,00:33:08.027,Okay!
00:33:09.988,00:33:12.449,"Uh, is it weird that we never got around to singing today?"
00:33:12.449,00:33:18.664,"Uh, well, it's, uh, kind of hard to start singing without arrangements, and that's on me, so thank you for reminding me."
00:33:18.664,00:33:22.250,"Yeah, Bec, we're gonna need that ASAP so we can start nailing down our choreography."
00:33:22.250,00:33:24.043,"-Right on top of that, Chlo."
00:33:24.043,00:33:25.420,"Yeah, awes."
00:33:25.420,00:33:30.509,"Uh, so I just wanted to let you know that I've been working really hard on, you know, calming my nerves and keeping my eyes open."
00:33:30.509,00:33:33.219,"Um, I was wondering if you could give me some pointers, maybe?"
00:33:33.219,00:33:37.390,"And, you know, with the singing, I don't really know exactly -where you're gonna put me in the songs-- -I don't mean to be rude."
00:33:37.390,00:33:40.185,I just have somewhere that I need to be.
00:33:40.185,00:33:42.771,"-Um, you did great today."
00:33:48.109,00:33:50.236,Yeah.
00:34:07.045,00:34:09.088,"All right, uh, hold up."
00:34:09.088,00:34:10.549,Wait. Hold up?
00:34:10.549,00:34:12.926,"Man, I sound awesome right now. What are you talking about?"
00:34:12.926,00:34:15.136,"Nah, it's not-- it's not on you."
00:34:15.136,00:34:16.555,So just-- you go ahead and take five.
00:34:16.555,00:34:22.435,"It better be a tech thing 'cause, huh, the way I sound in my eardrums, this is immaculate, man."
00:34:25.230,00:34:28.692,"This song, there's nothing-- nothing special about it yet."
00:34:28.692,00:34:30.193,Do you know what I mean?
00:34:30.193,00:34:33.321,"-Any ideas? Because I-- -All right, um, hear me out."
00:34:33.321,00:34:40.620,"-Please, Dax, please-- -We could remove the sleigh bells and put in kalimba."
00:34:42.581,00:34:43.790,"You know, the finger thing?"
00:34:43.790,00:34:45.834,I know what a kalimba does.
00:34:45.834,00:34:47.544,"I know how it's operated, okay?"
00:34:47.544,00:34:49.546,-Kalim-- -Don't say it again.
00:34:49.546,00:34:52.049,Go-- go in the corner.
00:34:52.049,00:34:54.593,But what am I gonna do with my sriracha?
00:34:54.593,00:34:58.931,Say one more hipster thing and I'm gonna shove you in your vintage bassoon case.
00:34:58.931,00:35:00.933,Okay?
00:35:02.141,00:35:04.227,Turn.
00:35:04.227,00:35:05.896,"Aim higher, people, okay?"
00:35:05.896,00:35:08.899,And be very careful what you pitch to me next.
00:35:08.899,00:35:11.818,"Um, just have him sing it again the same way."
00:35:13.070,00:35:14.905,Who-- who are you?
00:35:14.905,00:35:17.490,Nobody. Literally nobody.
00:35:18.450,00:35:20.243,"No, okay, okay."
00:35:20.243,00:35:21.620,Sure.
00:35:21.620,00:35:24.456,Nobody else has an idea.
00:35:24.456,00:35:29.586,"Let's, uh, do it exactly the same way again."
00:35:29.586,00:35:31.463,"Will do, nephew."
00:36:41.533,00:36:43.242,Or it can be something different.
00:36:41.533,00:36:44.494,"It can-- -No, shh-shh."
00:36:44.494,00:36:47.664,"That was amazing, Snoop."
00:36:47.664,00:36:49.457,"You can take a small break, man."
00:36:49.457,00:36:51.793,Everything perfection.
00:36:51.793,00:36:53.962,Groovy like a drive-in movie.
00:36:55.172,00:36:57.007,"Um, you can sing."
00:36:57.007,00:37:01.887,"Um, yeah, I'm, like, a three-time collegiate a cappella champion, so..."
00:37:01.887,00:37:05.264,we're both huge successes in our fields.
00:37:05.264,00:37:07.517,"Yeah, yeah, let's say that."
00:37:07.517,00:37:09.895,"Uh, what do you do here?"
00:37:09.895,00:37:13.481,I just get coffee and burritos and stuff.
00:37:13.481,00:37:15.608,"I want to produce music, um..."
00:37:15.608,00:37:17.276,"Dax, can you do me a favor?"
00:37:17.276,00:37:20.279,Turn around right now and watch this exchange.
00:37:20.279,00:37:22.949,"That's value-added, okay?"
00:37:22.949,00:37:27.120,"If you have any demos that you'd like me to listen to, I'll make the time."
00:37:27.120,00:37:29.039,"-Oh, seriously?"
00:37:29.039,00:37:31.249,-Oh!
00:37:31.249,00:37:33.292,-Uh-huh.
00:37:31.249,00:37:36.588,- She did something that was helpful and now I'm going to reward her by listening to her demos.
00:37:36.588,00:37:39.925,Turn back around.
00:37:41.760,00:37:44.596,"So, Snoop, uh, we've got an idea."
00:37:44.596,00:37:47.640,"Me, too. Water skis, but for dry land."
00:37:47.640,00:37:49.350,Real playa. You know what I'm talking about?
00:37:49.350,00:37:52.645,-Brilliant.
00:37:52.645,00:37:54.397,-I'll write that down.
00:38:17.712,00:38:19.256,What am I looking at?
00:38:19.256,00:38:21.258,-We're pillow-fighting!
00:38:21.258,00:38:22.467,Ah!
00:38:22.467,00:38:24.970,"You know this sets women back, like, 30 years."
00:38:24.970,00:38:26.721,We're just relieving some stress.
00:38:26.721,00:38:28.347,This was on the porch.
00:38:28.347,00:38:29.975,-Ooh.
00:38:29.975,00:38:32.560,What is that?
00:38:40.860,00:38:43.655,"Whoa, looks like we've been invited to sing at some kind of a party."
00:38:43.655,00:38:45.907,We're going to sing?
00:38:45.907,00:38:48.367,"Well, there's just an address and a password."
00:38:48.367,00:38:49.953,How sexy and mysterious.
00:38:49.953,00:38:53.165,Like how all my teeth are from other people.
00:39:02.257,00:39:04.259,Anyone else scared?
00:39:04.259,00:39:07.012,I already lived longer than I expected.
00:39:11.057,00:39:12.142,Password.
00:39:14.393,00:39:16.354,Fart noise?
00:39:16.354,00:39:18.982,Did you not see the parentheses?
00:39:26.405,00:39:30.327,Bellas.
00:39:31.494,00:39:38.043,Standing in front of you ladies happens to be the world's biggest a cappella fan.
00:39:38.043,00:39:39.878,-We found you!
00:39:39.878,00:39:42.797,"-Yeah, well, here I am."
00:39:42.797,00:39:47.510,"So, last week, when I was having a tinkle, it occurred to me-- do not, do not!"
00:39:47.510,00:39:50.263,-Sorry.
00:39:50.263,00:39:54.059,You do not come to a gentleman's house and touch his goose.
00:39:54.059,00:39:56.435,So are we early or...
00:39:56.435,00:39:58.437,"Actually, you're pretty late."
00:39:58.437,00:40:00.398,"Come on, let's go!"
00:40:03.902,00:40:06.029,This is the big time.
00:40:17.332,00:40:21.086,"Das Sound Machine, two o'clock."
00:40:21.086,00:40:23.671,"Tiny Mouse, we meet again."
00:40:23.671,00:40:25.924,Another verbal beatdown.
00:40:25.924,00:40:27.550,Highlight of my day.
00:40:27.550,00:40:31.721,"So, have you abandoned your foolish plans to face us at the Worlds?"
00:40:31.721,00:40:36.601,"You wish, you gorgeous specimen."
00:40:36.601,00:40:38.603,She's really in my head.
00:40:38.603,00:40:39.812,Very well.
00:40:39.812,00:40:42.148,I'll be happy to send you there.
00:40:42.148,00:40:45.818,I'll mail you.
00:40:45.818,00:40:52.450,"Well, it would cost more than nothing, but still cheaper than shipping, like, a horse or perhaps an adult moose."
00:40:52.450,00:40:54.327,Did you ever think maybe you're too big?
00:40:54.327,00:40:56.204,-It would cost a fortune to mail you!
00:40:56.204,00:40:58.415,-You're enormous!
00:40:58.415,00:41:01.834,-I think we should change her name to Feisty Mouse.
00:41:01.834,00:41:04.587,"Just need to find these, like-- like a taller pair of shoes."
00:41:04.587,00:41:06.047,-It wasn't a big deal.
00:41:06.047,00:41:07.799,Hey!
00:41:09.175,00:41:10.843,-I guess I gotta go.
00:41:10.843,00:41:12.053,-Why?
00:41:12.053,00:41:22.230,Welcome to the first ever showdown of the National A Cappella Laser Ninja Dragon League!
00:41:24.649,00:41:28.569,Can you dig it?
00:41:31.239,00:41:34.575,"Okay, let's meet our teams."
00:41:34.575,00:41:37.412,"First, we have the Treblemakers!"
00:41:37.412,00:41:40.248,"-Yeah, all right!"
00:41:40.248,00:41:43.460,"Okay, we have the Barden Bellas!"
00:41:43.460,00:41:45.544,-Hey.
00:41:45.544,00:41:48.965,-We have the Tone Hangers!
00:41:56.473,00:42:01.769,"And taking a break from their national tour, Das Sound Machine!"
00:42:01.769,00:42:05.398,-DSM! DSM! DSM!
00:42:05.398,00:42:09.986,"And the pride of Wisconsin, the Green Bay Packers!"
00:42:12.364,00:42:14.824,Let's go!
00:42:14.824,00:42:16.575,- Let's go!
00:42:16.575,00:42:19.078,I'd like the be the brisket in that man sandwich.
00:42:19.078,00:42:21.164,"Well, here's how this is gonna work."
00:42:21.164,00:42:26.878,"When I point to you, you sing a song from one of the categories that's gonna appear up there on the big board."
00:42:26.878,00:42:28.587,There's only one rule.
00:42:28.587,00:42:30.589,You have to meet the beat.
00:42:30.589,00:42:32.133,"-Here, come here."
00:42:32.133,00:42:36.429,Ahem.
00:42:37.972,00:42:41.976,But you have to do it follow-the-leader style.
00:43:03.706,00:43:06.042,"Wow! Oh, boy!"
00:43:06.042,00:43:09.462,"Oh, my goodness."
00:43:09.462,00:43:14.884,"Damn. If you can't carry the tune, the whole team's out."
00:43:14.884,00:43:17.470,As in you gone!
00:43:17.470,00:43:19.805,"And then-- Cornelius, this is too heavy."
00:43:19.805,00:43:23.435,I told you before-- 'cause I hurt my arm saluting the flag.
00:43:25.019,00:43:26.271,"Okay, sorry."
00:43:26.271,00:43:29.899,"Now, the winners will get..."
00:43:29.899,00:43:32.777,epic bragging rights!
00:43:32.777,00:43:34.695,-What?
00:43:34.695,00:43:36.864,"Oh, and I'm sorry, did I not mention this?"
00:43:36.864,00:43:40.659,"A $42,000 gift card to Dave &amp; Buster's!"
00:43:42.161,00:43:43.662,I was going there anyway.
00:43:43.662,00:43:45.373,I know Clay Matthews wants it.
00:43:45.373,00:43:48.667,"Okay, all right."
00:43:48.667,00:43:51.504,Let's take a look at the first category!
00:43:51.504,00:43:54.507,"-Ooh, songs about butts."
00:43:54.507,00:43:56.675,"-You know, anything on the radio, basically, right?"
00:43:56.675,00:43:58.553,Now think about what you're gonna sing!
00:43:58.553,00:44:01.931,Let's start with Das Sound Machine!
00:44:27.999,00:44:29.501,-What?
00:45:03.618,00:45:05.744,-Whoo!
00:45:10.291,00:45:32.771,"for this 'cause my body's too in your face, you get Girl, I love that butt, but the butt's not what matters."
00:45:32.771,00:45:34.649,You know what does?
00:45:34.649,00:45:37.360,I'll take you to a nice hot meal and I'll tip the waiter.
00:45:37.360,00:45:39.487,"Oh, my God, stop!"
00:45:39.487,00:45:41.447,-What was that?
00:45:41.447,00:45:45.702,Not how we play the game.
00:45:45.702,00:45:50.456,You think you're a better lyricist than Sir Mix-A-Lot?
00:45:50.456,00:45:53.459,A man who was knighted by Queen.
00:45:53.459,00:45:56.462,"Yes, no-- no, sir, I do not."
00:45:56.462,00:45:58.797,I caught a glimpse of an angel.
00:45:58.797,00:46:00.299,- I got inspired.
00:46:00.299,00:46:01.884,"Well, you're going to hell."
00:46:01.884,00:46:04.512,"Because, Treblemakers, you gone!"
00:46:04.512,00:46:07.181,-You gone!
00:46:08.600,00:46:09.892,-Sorry.
00:46:09.892,00:46:11.519,"-I'm sorry, man."
00:46:11.519,00:46:14.813,Let's take a look at the next category!
00:46:14.813,00:46:16.315,"Oh, country love!"
00:46:16.315,00:46:18.317,"Oh, oh, oh!"
00:46:18.317,00:46:20.236,Nobody in this room has loved more tender than I have.
00:46:20.236,00:46:21.487,Please pick us.
00:46:21.487,00:46:23.406,Let me have it.
00:46:23.406,00:46:25.366,-Let the world have it.
00:46:25.366,00:46:27.243,-I would give it to him.
00:46:27.243,00:46:28.827,"Well, why don't we start with you?"
00:46:28.827,00:46:31.330,"Tone Hangers, you're up!"
00:46:31.330,00:46:32.915,"All right, I got this."
00:46:32.915,00:46:35.752,-I got this.
00:46:35.752,00:46:40.005,How 'bout them Cowboys?
00:46:42.425,00:46:48.389,-Yee-haw!
00:47:10.578,00:47:21.213,"he'll think before -Come on, man."
00:47:21.213,00:47:22.881,"God damn it, I got nothin', guys."
00:47:22.881,00:47:27.303,-What?
00:47:27.303,00:47:28.845,-I'm sorry.
00:47:28.845,00:47:30.723,"Man, you are such a dis-a-aca-pointment."
00:47:30.723,00:47:34.727,-Boo.
00:47:30.723,00:47:37.896,"Moncrieff Matthews IV, what on God's green one are you doing?"
00:47:37.896,00:47:40.941,Just-- I had my mind on those 42 Gs at D&amp;B's.
00:47:40.941,00:47:42.276,Tokens.
00:47:42.276,00:47:44.153,I'm afraid you can kiss that good-bye.
00:47:44.153,00:47:45.613,-Green Bay Packers...
00:47:45.613,00:47:46.905,"No, no, no, no!"
00:47:46.905,00:47:48.282,You gone!
00:47:50.284,00:47:52.662,Let's see what the next category is!
00:47:54.413,00:47:56.833,"Oh, yes!"
00:47:56.833,00:47:59.418,"Oh, I was his personal assistant."
00:47:59.418,00:48:01.003,"-Oh, unfair!"
00:48:01.003,00:48:02.921,"-Yes, we got this."
00:48:02.921,00:48:04.923,"-Get in there, get in there."
00:48:02.921,00:48:06.258,"-Okay, then why don't we start with you, Das Sound Machine?"
00:49:06.068,00:49:09.071,-That doesn't deserve a boo.
00:49:09.071,00:49:10.947,I killed that!
00:49:10.947,00:49:19.331,Explain for everyone because it sounds like you're implying that John Mayer and Tina Turner are having...
00:49:19.331,00:49:20.999,"-Oh, yeah."
00:49:20.999,00:49:22.501,Get 'em out!
00:49:22.501,00:49:24.128,I don't know if I believe him!
00:49:24.128,00:49:25.337,I'm tell-- I'm telling the truth!
00:49:25.337,00:49:28.841,"Okay, Tone Hangers, you gone!"
00:49:28.841,00:49:31.928,-Two! We have our final two!
00:49:31.928,00:49:33.721,Now we have a showdown!
00:49:33.721,00:49:35.514,"All right, come on in."
00:49:35.514,00:49:37.015,Let's do this face-off style.
00:49:37.015,00:49:42.020,"Okay, let's take a look, see what your final category is."
00:49:42.020,00:49:45.023,Who's gonna sing?
00:49:45.023,00:49:47.944,"Okay, y'all, take a second to think about it."
00:49:47.944,00:49:49.236,"Time's up, go!"
00:50:58.973,00:51:05.688,"I'm sorry, what '90s hip-hop jam is that again?"
00:51:05.688,00:51:07.773,Um...
00:51:07.773,00:51:10.860,More like a 21st century jam.
00:51:10.860,00:51:13.946,"That's it, yeah."
00:51:18.116,00:51:20.036,Just stay calm.
00:51:22.120,00:51:24.373,You're saying it's an original.
00:51:24.373,00:51:27.292,"Yes, I'm saying it's an original."
00:51:29.962,00:51:33.340,"Go home, little girl!"
00:51:33.340,00:51:34.842,Our jam is covers.
00:51:34.842,00:51:36.969,We spit on originals.
00:51:36.969,00:51:40.222,-What is your name?
00:51:40.222,00:51:43.559,Emily.
00:51:46.687,00:51:55.487,"In light of this embarrassing and unprofessional information, I am forced to declare..."
00:51:57.239,00:52:01.619,-...Das Sound Machine is the winner!
00:52:04.413,00:52:08.417,-Oh! Oh!
00:52:19.095,00:52:20.846,"Hey, did you really write that?"
00:52:20.846,00:52:22.848,"You shouldn't have done that, Emily."
00:52:22.848,00:52:25.183,Now DSM thinks that they have the drop on us.
00:52:25.183,00:52:26.936,I'm sorry.
00:52:26.936,00:52:28.854,I understand if you want me to crawl under a rock and die.
00:52:28.854,00:52:31.107,"Hey, we don't want-- hey, we don't want that."
00:52:31.107,00:52:34.276,"-Hey, Becs, let's go meet the Green Bay Packers."
00:52:34.276,00:52:49.708,"it's wiggity, wiggity, Boo!"
00:52:49.708,00:52:52.294,Oh!
00:52:52.294,00:52:53.963,Would you like to have sex later?
00:52:53.963,00:52:55.965,No!
00:52:55.965,00:52:58.592,"So that's a no, then?"
00:52:58.592,00:53:01.219,It's an 100% no.
00:53:19.571,00:53:20.823,I want it! Gimme!
00:53:27.830,00:53:31.834,D-Dax. I swear if this kid was not my nephew...
00:53:31.834,00:53:36.212,"Hey, I know you're crazy busy, but have you had a chance to check out those demos?"
00:53:36.212,00:53:38.841,"Yeah, yeah."
00:53:41.259,00:53:43.679,This dead air between us is a good sign.
00:53:43.679,00:53:45.764,Look.
00:53:45.764,00:53:48.184,You got a great ear.
00:53:45.764,00:53:50.435,"You proved that in the booth, and I was super excited to hear what else you had."
00:53:50.435,00:53:53.772,And what you gave me was more mashups.
00:53:53.772,00:53:55.774,That's sort of what I do.
00:53:55.774,00:53:58.276,"Listen, Reggie-- is it Reggie?"
00:53:58.276,00:54:02.531,Beca?
00:54:02.531,00:54:04.867,"Okay, here's the thing."
00:54:04.867,00:54:08.286,Any kid with ears and a laptop can do that.
00:54:08.286,00:54:09.454,Dax can do that.
00:54:09.454,00:54:10.706,-All right?
00:54:10.706,00:54:14.960,So that's fine if you want a career DJing raves out in the desert.
00:54:14.960,00:54:20.298,"But if you want to write music producer on your tax forms someday, then you've gotta have an original voice, do you understand?"
00:54:20.298,00:54:22.300,You've gotta show me what you have.
00:54:22.300,00:54:25.303,"Right now, what I have is a demo with mashups on it."
00:54:25.303,00:54:27.723,"Yeah, yeah."
00:54:25.303,00:54:29.225,"I got lots of stuff to say, I'm just saving it all up."
00:54:29.225,00:54:31.018,Look...
00:54:31.018,00:54:33.395,"uh, Rege-- Rebec-- what is it?"
00:54:33.395,00:54:35.313,"-Beca? Okay, yeah."
00:54:35.313,00:54:39.985,"So, you're an intern and everybody else here is an intern."
00:54:39.985,00:54:43.155,"You're talented, everybody else in here is talented."
00:54:43.155,00:54:47.325,"So what the hell makes you special, you know what I mean?"
00:54:47.325,00:54:56.127,"So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give you one more shot to show me who you are as an artist, okay?"
00:54:56.127,00:54:57.669,Do not waste it.
00:54:57.669,00:55:00.338,"No, sir."
00:55:00.338,00:55:07.012,"I really hope you don't, for your sake, 'cause I would hate to think that singing covers in an a cappella group is all you can do."
00:55:07.012,00:55:09.848,Please replace the paper towels.
00:55:25.363,00:55:28.867,"- Hey, it's Jesse. Text me."
00:55:28.867,00:55:32.496,"Hey, it's me."
00:55:32.496,00:55:38.710,"hey, so you might not be able to hear this message because it turns out I have nothing to say."
00:55:38.710,00:55:42.965,That's music industry speak for I suck.
00:55:44.382,00:55:47.219,"Uh, you're definitely asleep right now."
00:55:47.219,00:55:48.929,That's cool.
00:55:48.929,00:55:51.389,Text me when you're up.
00:55:51.389,00:55:53.475,-Hey.
00:55:53.475,00:55:56.478,What?
00:55:53.475,00:55:58.563,A girl can't say she's going to grab a smoothie and return 14 hours later?
00:55:58.563,00:56:00.316,There's nothing suspicious about that.
00:56:01.733,00:56:03.610,Why are you up so late anyways?
00:56:03.610,00:56:06.404,"Um, I was just figuring some stuff out."
00:56:06.404,00:56:08.364,"Oh, you're working on the set?"
00:56:09.992,00:56:11.660,Um...
00:56:11.660,00:56:13.078,I'm not working on the set.
00:56:13.078,00:56:15.914,-I'm just like-- -What?
00:56:15.914,00:56:17.666,Nothing.
00:56:23.588,00:56:30.428,"If you did wanna share something with me, your best friend, I'm a great keeper of secrets."
00:56:30.428,00:56:32.430,I'm like a safe that locks...
00:56:32.430,00:56:34.432,with a key.
00:56:34.432,00:56:39.688,And the key is stashed up my bum -because...
00:56:39.688,00:56:43.275,So this has nothing to do with that internship that you sneak off to?
00:56:43.275,00:56:46.653,"-What? Um-- -Come on, Beca."
00:56:46.653,00:56:51.867,You know how we do that thing every month where I take $20 out of your purse and you pretend not to notice?
00:56:51.867,00:56:54.452,I saw your ID badge in your bag.
00:56:54.452,00:56:56.330,Don't be mad.
00:56:56.330,00:57:02.211,"I'm not-- I'm not mad, actually, about the badge."
00:57:02.211,00:57:03.461,Shh.
00:57:03.461,00:57:05.714,Let's just focus on your lie.
00:57:05.714,00:57:09.676,"Beca, why didn't you tell us?"
00:57:09.676,00:57:11.720,Or at least Chloe?
00:57:11.720,00:57:14.598,I don't know. Just-- 'cause it's just easier.
00:57:14.598,00:57:20.896,"There's, like, so much going on, and Chloe would lose her mind if she thought my sole focus wasn't winning Worlds."
00:57:20.896,00:57:27.485,"Sorry, just now I'm freaking out because, um, it turns out, like, I'm totally not good enough to be a music producer."
00:57:27.485,00:57:30.488,Which is cool and fun to know as I enter the rest of my life.
00:57:30.488,00:57:33.491,"Okay, I'm just gonna stop you right there."
00:57:33.491,00:57:38.163,"You're the most talented person that I know, and I've met three of the Wiggles."
00:57:38.163,00:57:40.999,-Intimately.
00:57:40.999,00:57:44.044,"Beca, do you know how awesome you are?"
00:57:44.044,00:57:47.339,"You're Beca effing Mitchell, okay?"
00:57:47.339,00:57:50.342,You're the big B.M.
00:57:50.342,00:57:51.468,You're awesome.
00:57:53.637,00:57:55.264,Do you need some of my confidence?
00:57:55.264,00:57:57.515,'Cause I could maybe tone mine down a notch.
00:57:57.515,00:57:59.601,"Yeah, okay."
00:57:59.601,00:58:02.104,"Here, let me rub some out."
00:58:02.104,00:58:04.731,"-Oh, okay."
00:58:04.731,00:58:05.732,I think you need a bit more.
00:58:05.732,00:58:07.359,That comes from there?
00:58:07.359,00:58:09.403,"-Okay, thank you."
00:58:09.403,00:58:11.529,I'm gonna get you the good stuff now.
00:58:11.529,00:58:13.531,"No, I don't want butt confidence. I don't want your butt confidence!"
00:58:13.531,00:58:15.909,I don't want your butt-- no!
00:58:15.909,00:58:17.535,"I have enough, I have enough!"
00:58:23.708,00:58:26.544,Mm-mm.
00:58:26.544,00:58:28.046,Just useless.
00:58:28.046,00:58:29.547,"I believe in you, Beca."
00:58:46.898,00:58:48.608,Come on.
00:58:50.277,00:58:53.447,"Whoa, candles, cloth napkins."
00:58:53.447,00:58:56.574,-Foods other than salsa.
00:58:56.574,00:58:59.911,This is a little classier than our typical hookups.
00:58:59.911,00:59:01.746,Is it? Huh.
00:59:01.746,00:59:10.672,"I have a patisserie, some charcuterie, and a huge bowl of exotic capers."
00:59:10.672,00:59:14.092,"I didn't know what those were, but they're like salty peas."
00:59:17.513,00:59:26.813,"So, I don't know if you've seen the news lately, but there's a war and also the economy..."
00:59:26.813,00:59:31.860,"is dipping, ebbing, and flowing."
00:59:31.860,00:59:33.778,"Bumper, what's going on?"
00:59:33.778,00:59:35.613,Now you're kind of creeping me out.
00:59:35.613,00:59:38.158,"Okay, I guess I'll just lay it all out there."
00:59:38.158,00:59:50.962,"The reason that I brought you here tonight was because I was thinking that maybe, perhaps, if you're interested-- this is harder than I thought it was gonna be."
00:59:53.215,00:59:56.427,I wanna date you.
00:59:56.427,00:59:57.677,"Like, for real."
00:59:57.677,00:59:59.596,Like a real couple.
01:00:01.306,01:00:08.646,"Where we, like, go out in public and hold hands and ride bikes together, or we go to an or-chid and pick apples."
01:00:08.646,01:00:14.152,"Or we, like, do one of those Build-A-Bear workshops together, and we'd build bears."
01:00:14.152,01:00:19.032,"And you'd name one Bumper, and I'll name one Fat Amy, and yours will be bigger than mine."
01:00:19.032,01:00:21.993,And we can put 'em on our bed that we share.
01:00:23.661,01:00:25.622,What do you say?
01:00:28.708,01:00:31.628,No.
01:00:31.628,01:00:33.880,I don't...
01:00:33.880,01:00:35.924,want to do that.
01:00:35.924,01:00:37.842,"Yeah, that's cool."
01:00:37.842,01:00:40.429,"-It was stu-- it was a stupid idea, anyways."
01:00:40.429,01:00:42.013,"Obviously, we shouldn't do that."
01:00:42.013,01:00:50.688,We should just go back to how things used to be and just go at it on top of all this expensive food that I bought.
01:00:50.688,01:00:51.648,Are you crying?
01:00:54.318,01:00:55.777,Nope.
01:00:55.777,01:01:00.532,"-No, I'm not."
01:01:00.532,01:01:02.951,I can't be tied down by anything.
01:01:02.951,01:01:07.372,I'm on a walkabout.
01:01:10.208,01:01:12.210,-You know.
01:01:12.210,01:01:14.921,I'm like a firework.
01:01:14.921,01:01:16.590,-I can't be tied down.
01:01:16.590,01:01:18.716,Then that's it.
01:01:18.716,01:01:21.803,Because I'm not gonna-- I'm not gonna keep going on like this.
01:01:21.803,01:01:23.721,-Well-- -Fine.
01:01:23.721,01:01:26.057,"Fine, if that's how you feel, then I think we're done."
01:01:26.057,01:01:27.725,I think it's over.
01:01:27.725,01:01:29.186,-That's it.
01:01:31.563,01:01:33.773,"Well, it's-- so it's over, then."
01:01:33.773,01:01:36.401,"-Fine, then it's over."
01:01:43.241,01:01:46.495,"No, too late!"
01:01:46.495,01:01:49.373,"I figured when we didn't do the serenade, the backup plan should be to play her off."
01:01:49.373,01:01:50.748,"-Is that-- -Turn around, go back."
01:01:50.748,01:01:52.917,I don't want to hear another peep!
01:01:55.753,01:01:57.422,-Benji!
01:02:00.551,01:02:02.844,"Hey, guys, it's my first performance."
01:02:02.844,01:02:05.763,It's just a chance for us to rehearse for Worlds.
01:02:05.763,01:02:08.684,"As far as I can tell, it's just for a bunch of old people."
01:02:18.443,01:02:20.111,There's a full house out there.
01:02:20.111,01:02:23.281,-How did we get this gig again?
01:02:23.281,01:02:24.782,"You know what, guys?"
01:02:24.782,01:02:30.788,"I know we're trying a lot of new stuff, but I feel like we're gonna get out there and we're gonna feel that energy and we're just gonna nail all of it!"
01:02:30.788,01:02:32.332,"Sorry, these braids are so tight."
01:02:32.332,01:02:33.958,You know what?
01:02:33.958,01:02:37.879,"I mean, I have many, many doubts, because if we fail this, then we won't win the Worlds."
01:02:37.879,01:02:39.797,"And if we don't win the Worlds, there will be no more Bellas."
01:02:39.797,01:02:44.135,"And without the Bellas, then my life would have had no..."
01:02:45.803,01:02:47.805,Malaria.
01:02:47.805,01:02:50.850,"Meaning, Flo."
01:02:50.850,01:02:52.810,"Three, two."
01:02:52.810,01:02:57.399,"Hey, everybody, welcome back to Let's Talk-apella, the portable podcast edition."
01:02:57.399,01:03:02.820,We are following the story of the embattled Barden Bellas on their road to redemption.
01:03:02.820,01:03:05.823,Trying to crawl their way back into the public's affection.
01:03:05.823,01:03:08.910,-And if they can just hold off...
01:03:08.910,01:03:11.829,-...showing us any more of their genitalia...
01:03:11.829,01:03:13.831,they may make it to the World Championship.
01:03:13.831,01:03:16.543,"Well, I can't unsee it."
01:03:16.543,01:03:18.462,"It's-- well, here's a picture of it right here."
01:03:18.462,01:03:20.631,"No, this should not be your screensaver, John."
01:03:20.631,01:03:25.009,"the stage, the Barden Bellas."
01:03:56.874,01:03:58.543,-Whoa.
01:03:58.543,01:04:00.170,This is some exciting stuff.
01:04:27.781,01:04:30.992,"-Wow, a lot going on up there."
01:04:30.992,01:04:33.745,"Honestly, my senses are overwhelmed here, John."
01:04:33.745,01:04:35.747,to tone down the theatrics.
01:04:35.747,01:04:37.999,Let's hope there are no props.
01:04:37.999,01:04:39.917,"Oh, they brought the props out, John."
01:04:39.917,01:04:41.837,And there are the props.
01:04:41.837,01:04:44.005,This is more of a circus act than an a cappella performance.
01:04:44.005,01:04:47.425,"Gail, it's as if the Barden Bellas just don't know who they are anymore."
01:04:57.185,01:04:59.354,-Whoa!
01:04:59.354,01:05:01.939,-She's on fire!
01:05:01.939,01:05:06.528,"Oh, my God! Am I-- -I'm on fire!"
01:05:06.528,01:05:08.655,"-Good day, good heavens."
01:05:08.655,01:05:10.448,-Incoming!
01:05:10.448,01:05:12.033,"I can't breathe, girl!"
01:05:12.033,01:05:13.660,"Oh, my."
01:05:13.660,01:05:15.953,Beating DSM seems impossible for this team.
01:05:15.953,01:05:20.792,Even these common people can see that the Barden Bellas have no shot at reinstatement.
01:05:20.792,01:05:24.796,They are an embarrassment to a cappella and all that it stands for.
01:05:24.796,01:05:28.966,This is what happens when you send girls to college.
01:05:28.966,01:05:30.176,Is it?
01:05:38.226,01:05:40.520,Is that for a class?
01:05:40.520,01:05:47.985,"No, it's just when I get stressed, words just sort of flow right outta me and I try and channel them in my songwriting and-- Are we just gonna ignore what happened back there?"
01:05:47.985,01:05:50.822,"Guys, hello!"
01:05:47.985,01:05:54.659,The Worlds are right around the corner and you guys are acting like we didn't just eat a big bag of-- -Why are you yelling at me?
01:05:54.659,01:05:56.994,I almost burned to death because of you a-ca-bitches.
01:05:56.994,01:05:59.997,"If you almost died, it's because you were standing in the wrong spot."
01:05:59.997,01:06:01.999,"No, Flo flipped into me."
01:06:01.999,01:06:03.835,"Sure, blame the minority."
01:06:03.835,01:06:06.838,"I'm black, gay, and a woman."
01:06:06.838,01:06:08.840,I'm not pointing the finger at anybody.
01:06:08.840,01:06:11.927,-It was Legacy's fault.
01:06:08.840,01:06:14.053,"-Me? But I didn't-- Obviously, we're not gonna beat Das Sound Machine at their game."
01:06:14.053,01:06:17.933,"So we need a new plan, like, now."
01:06:17.933,01:06:21.686,"At times like these, there's only one thing for us to do."
01:06:21.686,01:06:24.188,Fake your own death and flee the country.
01:06:24.188,01:06:27.024,Close.
01:06:29.360,01:06:31.571,"Look, I think the retreat would be a good thing."
01:06:31.571,01:06:34.866,You girls need to bond heading into Worlds.
01:06:34.866,01:06:37.034,-It'll be so much fun.
01:06:37.034,01:06:40.037,"No, Mom, it's bad."
01:06:40.037,01:06:43.291,"Oh, big deal."
01:06:40.037,01:06:47.044,I remember putting your godmother Maggie Pistol in a chokehold because she insisted that George Michael was gay.
01:06:47.044,01:06:49.046,-Who?
01:06:49.046,01:06:55.052,I'm just worried that my entire Bella career will be that one terrible performance.
01:06:55.052,01:06:58.097,"I mean, I'll never get to solo at Lincoln Center, you know?"
01:06:58.097,01:07:00.057,But you're gonna get to go to Europe.
01:07:00.057,01:07:03.060,That would've been the highlight of my college career.
01:07:03.060,01:07:06.230,And you girls can win it.
01:07:06.230,01:07:10.902,-You just made being a Bella sound so amazing.
01:07:10.902,01:07:14.656,It's a sisterhood that is gonna support you for the rest of your life.
01:07:14.656,01:07:18.075,"I know you're not feeling it, but you will."
01:07:18.075,01:07:22.079,This won't be the end of the Bellas.
01:07:32.590,01:07:35.593,"-Hey, Benji."
01:07:35.593,01:07:40.431,"Listen, I think, uh-- -I think you're missing a word here."
01:07:40.431,01:07:44.019,"Oh, God. No, no, no, no."
01:07:44.019,01:07:45.645,I didn't-- I didn't think so.
01:07:45.645,01:07:46.855,-That's really embarrassing.
01:07:45.645,01:07:48.773,"-No, it looks-- Syntax is usually my forte."
01:07:48.773,01:07:50.149,-I don't know how that happened.
01:07:50.149,01:07:51.526,Thank you.
01:07:53.695,01:07:55.446,Um...
01:07:55.446,01:08:00.076,"When my hands aren't covered in-- in glitter paint, do you think maybe we could try that again?"
01:08:02.328,01:08:03.830,Yeah.
01:08:03.830,01:08:05.122,-Sure.
01:08:05.122,01:08:06.666,Okay.
01:08:06.666,01:08:10.795,"Well, I'll-- I'll-- I'll look forward to that."
01:08:10.795,01:08:14.131,"Just, uh, you know, let me know when they're clean."
01:08:14.131,01:08:15.633,I-- that's-- I will.
01:08:15.633,01:08:17.301,-Right. Okay.
01:08:17.301,01:08:19.054,All right.
01:08:22.432,01:08:25.142,"Okay, girls!"
01:08:25.142,01:08:27.103,"-Go, go, go, go, go!"
01:08:41.242,01:08:43.912,"Wow, this place is sweet."
01:08:43.912,01:08:45.162,Oh.
01:08:45.162,01:08:47.832,"It's nice, right?"
01:08:47.832,01:08:49.417,I need to find somewhere to charge my laptop.
01:08:49.417,01:08:52.003,How did you hear about this place?
01:08:52.003,01:08:54.130,From yours truly.
01:08:54.130,01:08:55.172,"Hello, Bellas."
01:08:55.172,01:08:57.759,Aubrey!
01:09:01.554,01:09:03.347,"Oh, wow."
01:09:03.347,01:09:05.683,-Emily. Hi.
01:09:05.683,01:09:14.109,"Welcome to the Lodge at Fallen Leaves, where Fortune 500 companies send their employees -to build teamwork skills."
01:09:14.109,01:09:20.197,"You know, I realized that I had a knack for barking orders and bending people's will, so I made a career out of it."
01:09:21.449,01:09:24.119,"Which reminds me-- fall in line, Bellas!"
01:09:24.119,01:09:25.912,she ain't changed.
01:09:25.912,01:09:27.204,-No straggling!
01:09:27.204,01:09:29.206,"-I see you, Jessica!"
01:09:29.206,01:09:41.094,It is with great sorrow and regret that I had to watch our once proud organization become a national disgrace.
01:09:42.929,01:09:46.099,-Can I have the keys to the minibar?
01:09:46.099,01:09:50.227,The Worlds signifies a shot at redemption.
01:09:50.227,01:09:54.398,You don't have a chance at winning until you find your sound again.
01:09:54.398,01:09:57.318,You have totally lost your harmony!
01:09:57.318,01:10:03.950,"So for the next two days, you will be doing everything together until you regain it."
01:10:03.950,01:10:07.996,"Ladies, get ready to be transformed."
01:10:07.996,01:10:19.256,"You are surrounded by the strength of your fellow Bellas and the support of a proud female tradition and a few dozen bear traps, so don't stray too far from the marked paths."
01:10:19.256,01:10:21.009,"-Okay, great, let's go!"
01:10:21.009,01:10:24.846,"Well, maybe I'll just start with a hot shower, maybe a little foot rub."
01:10:24.846,01:10:27.932,"Fat Amy, there are no guest rooms for you."
01:10:27.932,01:10:30.101,Then where are we staying?
01:10:37.775,01:10:39.986,I don't understand camping.
01:10:39.986,01:10:44.281,-We're voluntarily living like dogs.
01:10:44.281,01:10:46.117,This is the worst.
01:10:46.117,01:10:49.453,The air we're breathing right now is at least 90% fart.
01:10:49.453,01:10:53.624,"Yeah, uh, that reminds me, I need to see a man about a horse."
01:10:56.211,01:10:58.129,Ow!
01:10:58.129,01:11:00.882,Did anyone happen to pack a spare roll of toilet paper?
01:11:00.882,01:11:02.967,-Or a moist towelette?
01:11:02.967,01:11:06.345,"-Anyone have, like, a T-shirt, size extra small?"
01:11:06.345,01:11:09.557,"Okay, side of the tent it is."
01:11:14.020,01:11:16.313,-What are we doing here?
01:11:16.313,01:11:18.315,You seem so tense.
01:11:18.315,01:11:20.985,"Several body parts are rubbing my back right now, thank you."
01:11:20.985,01:11:26.866,"You know, Beca, we're very close, but I feel like this retreat is really gonna let us discover -everything about each other."
01:11:28.118,01:11:32.329,"You know, one of my biggest regrets is that I didn't do enough experimenting in college."
01:11:32.329,01:11:35.666,-You're so weird.
01:11:35.666,01:11:37.668,I wanna go home.
01:11:41.547,01:11:44.175,I hope the sun never comes up.
01:11:46.177,01:11:49.346,Why do I get the travel pillow?
01:11:49.346,01:11:50.974,Were you touching my goodies?
01:11:52.183,01:11:53.350,Yes.
01:11:53.350,01:12:00.900,"Oh, guys, I've got a little-- it won't-- I just need some help getting it out."
01:12:00.900,01:12:02.359,Can you sing something?
01:12:02.359,01:12:04.361,The pipe's a bit blocked.
01:12:11.995,01:12:15.372,-What kind of white shit is this?
01:12:17.541,01:12:20.628,like fro-yo now.
01:12:20.628,01:12:32.015,"and I can see the perfect sky Up and at 'em, Bellas!"
01:12:32.015,01:12:34.142,Let's go. Let's wake up.
01:12:34.142,01:12:36.393,"- Come on, pick up the pace, girls."
01:12:36.393,01:12:37.937,Come on!
01:12:37.937,01:12:44.944,Today we are going back to the basics to relearn how to sing as a group while also enduring death-defying team-building trust exercises.
01:12:44.944,01:12:48.405,-What a great idea.
01:13:20.188,01:13:21.939,"-Come on, lunch!"
01:13:34.451,01:13:38.873,she's Asian Jesus.
01:13:57.641,01:14:00.477,And now it's time for a breakdown.
01:14:24.835,01:14:28.589,"Okay, that was two steps away from being almost fine."
01:14:28.589,01:14:30.507,"Sorry, what are we doing?"
01:14:30.507,01:14:33.344,-We're rediscovering our sound.
01:14:33.344,01:14:36.513,'Cause it feels like we're just singing songs that would never go in our set.
01:14:36.513,01:14:37.640,"Beca, come on."
01:14:37.640,01:14:41.185,"No. None of us know how to beat Das Sound Machine, but I know it's not gonna be by doing this."
01:14:41.185,01:14:44.188,"This is just an exercise in finding harmony, Beca."
01:14:44.188,01:14:47.524,Sometimes you have to break things down before you can build them back up again.
01:14:47.524,01:14:49.526,I've got more important things to do.
01:14:49.526,01:14:50.987,-What could be more important than this?
01:14:50.987,01:14:52.529,Nothing. Forget it.
01:14:52.529,01:14:56.200,No. You don't think that we haven't all realized you've been a little checked out lately?
01:14:56.200,01:14:57.618,"Come on, Beca, just tell her."
01:14:57.618,01:15:00.288,I heard that.
01:15:00.288,01:15:03.458,"Oh, you misunderstood me."
01:15:06.543,01:15:08.879,"Listen, I don't want you guys to fight."
01:15:08.879,01:15:11.715,You're Beca and Chloe.
01:15:08.879,01:15:13.384,"Together you're Bhloe, and everyone loves a good blowey."
01:15:13.384,01:15:15.303,So...
01:15:15.303,01:15:16.887,Okay.
01:15:16.887,01:15:20.391,I've been interning at a recording studio and a legit music producer wants to hear my work.
01:15:20.391,01:15:22.477,"God forbid, I have something going on outside this group."
01:15:22.477,01:15:25.396,Okay. So why would you keep something like that from us?
01:15:25.396,01:15:27.106,'Cause you're obsessed!
01:15:27.106,01:15:30.651,We're graduating and the only person thinking about life after the Bellas is me.
01:15:30.651,01:15:33.237,What is so wrong with being focused on the Bellas?
01:15:33.237,01:15:35.739,This has been my family for seven years.
01:15:35.739,01:15:37.616,"Yeah, 'cause you're too scared to leave."
01:15:37.616,01:15:40.244,"-Sack up, dude!"
01:15:40.244,01:15:44.832,"Okay, so you've been lying to us for the entire year, and now you're just gonna flake out?"
01:15:44.832,01:15:46.583,"Now you're gonna flake out when the Worlds is, like, right after graduation?"
01:15:46.583,01:15:48.627,"Oh, my God."
01:15:48.627,01:15:50.463,I ca-- I am out of here.
01:15:50.463,01:15:52.173,"Oh, okay, you're just gonna leave now?"
01:15:52.173,01:15:54.509,"We all have to eventually, Chloe."
01:15:54.509,01:15:58.137,"-Wait, Beca-- -If you all knew what was good for you, -you'd follow me."
01:16:04.601,01:16:07.021,I'm stuck! I'm seeing spots.
01:16:07.021,01:16:08.605,"Well, well, well."
01:16:08.605,01:16:11.901,-Look who needs our help.
01:16:11.901,01:16:15.363,"No, what's not cool is you taking out your frustrations on us."
01:16:15.363,01:16:17.614,Really? That's what you're gonna say to me right now?
01:16:17.614,01:16:19.616,Help me!
01:16:21.618,01:16:23.620,"Aubrey, we need to get her down."
01:16:23.620,01:16:25.956,-We need a ladder.
01:16:25.956,01:16:29.544,They suggest a corporate hierarchy that's counterproductive to my team-building program.
01:16:29.544,01:16:32.463,What kind of operation are you running here?
01:16:32.463,01:16:35.508,"Seriously, this whole place is, like, full of booby traps."
01:16:35.508,01:16:39.554,And guess what?
01:16:39.554,01:16:41.972,unless it's for support if you have lower back issues.
01:16:41.972,01:16:46.602,"If-- okay-- if I'm about to die, I'm sorry. I didn't mean any of that stuff I said."
01:16:46.602,01:16:48.645,I love all of you.
01:16:46.602,01:16:50.647,I love all of you awesome nerds and I love being a Bella.
01:16:48.645,01:16:52.191,"I'm feel so stressed out right now-- Oh, my God!"
01:16:52.191,01:16:54.151,"-Oh, my gosh."
01:16:52.191,01:16:55.652,"-Jessica and Ashley, I don't actually know which one of you is which."
01:16:57.654,01:16:59.073,Don't worry. We're gonna get you down.
01:16:59.073,01:17:00.991,Focus up.
01:17:00.991,01:17:02.743,"Flo, get up."
01:17:02.743,01:17:04.745,Let's focus.
01:17:04.745,01:17:07.915,"-Don't worry, Beca."
01:17:14.547,01:17:16.591,I sleep upside down like a bat.
01:17:23.680,01:17:28.519,"It's just everything's changing so fast and I'm putting all this pressure on myself, you know?"
01:17:28.519,01:17:31.688,-I don't wanna fail.
01:17:31.688,01:17:34.691,"Yeah, I know, but I'm weird about that stuff."
01:17:34.691,01:17:37.111,"I thought I could figure it out on my own, and I can't."
01:17:38.446,01:17:41.824,Maybe I don't have anything original to say.
01:17:41.824,01:17:43.576,I wish I could do what you do.
01:17:43.576,01:17:47.246,"Well, I feel the same way about you."
01:17:47.246,01:17:49.706,"You're so good, it's intimidating."
01:17:49.706,01:17:54.253,All I've ever wanted is to be one of you.
01:17:54.253,01:17:56.880,"Not a legacy, but a Bella."
01:17:56.880,01:17:58.466,You are a real Bella.
01:17:58.466,01:18:01.718,You are one of us.
01:18:01.718,01:18:04.639,"-That's for life, dude."
01:18:05.973,01:18:08.267,Do you wanna collaborate on something?
01:18:09.726,01:18:12.313,"Wait, you're being serious?"
01:18:12.313,01:18:13.648,Yeah.
01:18:14.731,01:18:16.733,Yeah! Wow! Ooh!
01:18:16.733,01:18:20.737,Man! Yes! Who else feels like a winner tonight?
01:18:24.116,01:18:27.537,"I know it doesn't seem like it, but, um..."
01:18:27.537,01:18:29.246,"I'm afraid, too."
01:18:29.246,01:18:33.959,"To move on, to graduate, it's really scary."
01:18:33.959,01:18:38.130,"Yeah, it actually does seem like it, 'cause you're barely holding it together."
01:18:38.130,01:18:40.757,"Oh, well, it doesn't have to be scary, Chloe."
01:18:40.757,01:18:49.600,"When I was graduating, I never pictured myself running a retreat in the middle of the woods, but here I am."
01:18:49.600,01:18:55.772,Take it from someone who has dealt with some serious control issues.
01:18:55.772,01:19:02.863,"Like my dad always said, In the minefield of life, you must be prepared to lose both feet."
01:19:02.863,01:19:06.825,And I think you all know what I mean.
01:19:06.825,01:19:08.452,I don't.
01:19:08.452,01:19:13.123,"Then it's decided, this year I will graduate."
01:19:13.123,01:19:15.209,The Worlds will be my swan song.
01:19:15.209,01:19:18.337,I mean it.
01:19:18.337,01:19:20.715,I'll teach underprivileged children how to sing.
01:19:20.715,01:19:22.841,Or I'll dance exotically.
01:19:22.841,01:19:25.595,Whatever offers the most money.
01:19:27.096,01:19:28.931,"Well, yo, check this out."
01:19:28.931,01:19:31.434,-I'm moving to Maine to get hitched.
01:19:31.434,01:19:34.729,-And y'all can come.
01:19:34.729,01:19:36.855,"Yes, yes, yes."
01:19:36.855,01:19:39.233,"Okay, okay, guys."
01:19:39.233,01:19:41.318,Stop asking.
01:19:41.318,01:19:46.823,"So, after I graduate, there's a chance I will be deported."
01:19:46.823,01:19:50.827,"I will try to re-enter this country, but I will probably die at sea."
01:19:50.827,01:19:54.831,-So let's live for tonight! Yes!
01:19:58.628,01:20:00.921,"Lily, any plans?"
01:20:00.921,01:20:03.758,Just gonna travel through time.
01:20:05.842,01:20:09.888,"when I look back on this, I won't remember performing and competing."
01:20:09.888,01:20:12.849,I'm gonna remember you weirdos.
01:20:12.849,01:20:15.811,It makes me really sad to think it won't ever be like this again.
01:20:17.354,01:20:19.856,-I'm gonna miss you guys.
01:20:19.856,01:20:21.024,"Me, too."
01:20:21.024,01:20:23.778,"Yeah, me, too."
01:21:17.914,01:21:19.916,Did we just find our sound?
01:21:19.916,01:21:21.918,I think we did.
01:21:21.918,01:21:23.920,-Aw!.
01:21:23.920,01:21:25.881,My work here is done.
01:21:27.508,01:21:29.176,Thank you.
01:21:29.176,01:21:32.262,"Fat Amy, you never told us what you were gonna do after graduation."
01:21:32.262,01:21:35.474,"Uh, well, mm..."
01:21:35.474,01:21:37.351,"no, I don't have any plans."
01:21:37.351,01:21:41.188,'Cause you guys know me.
01:21:41.188,01:21:48.945,"-Ashley, what are you gonna do after-- -Actually, though, if we were to stop and really think, What could Fat Amy be capable of in the future?"
01:21:48.945,01:21:50.947,I'll tell you guys.
01:21:50.947,01:21:54.451,"I'd be living somewhere, like, sick, like Tulsa or Little Rock."
01:21:54.451,01:22:00.332,"By day, I'm a professional jelly wrestler for corporate events."
01:22:00.332,01:22:08.883,"And then every night, it's just me cuddled up with my fiancé, Bumper, and-- oh, wait."
01:22:12.511,01:22:13.970,I'm in love with Bumper.
01:22:15.347,01:22:21.729,"Okay, I've done something terrible and I'm not talking about crop-dusting Chloe and Beca right now."
01:22:21.729,01:22:26.024,Apologize for that.
01:22:26.024,01:22:28.026,And I need to win back my man.
01:22:28.026,01:22:31.321,-Screw your judgments!
01:22:31.321,01:22:32.907,"Go get him, Fat Amy!"
01:22:36.993,01:22:40.539,"-Guys, what happened?"
01:22:40.539,01:22:42.124,Somebody bring a s'more!
01:22:42.124,01:22:45.001,our next album cover.
01:22:45.001,01:22:46.503,Look at him.
01:22:46.503,01:22:48.589,I did that all myself today.
01:22:48.589,01:22:52.384,"No. I know that I only have one vote-- You got no votes, man."
01:22:52.384,01:22:53.803,"Okay, well, that hurts my feelings."
01:22:53.803,01:22:55.429,"It's just the truth, is the thing."
01:22:55.429,01:22:57.013,"Well, that hurts my feelings."
01:22:55.429,01:22:59.057,"With my vote, -I vote no to the pig..."
01:22:59.057,01:23:01.518,...and yes to this gloriousness.
01:23:01.518,01:23:03.604,We'll-- we'll put it to a vote later.
01:23:45.312,01:23:47.189,Nope! Turn it around.
01:23:47.189,01:24:02.663,of the words we've both -I don't wanna see you!
01:24:07.918,01:24:10.337,"Oh, really misjudged the size of this lake."
01:24:10.337,01:24:12.965,Why didn't she just walk around the lake?
01:24:12.965,01:24:14.633,Fat Amy doesn't do anything small.
01:24:14.633,01:24:17.302,"Yes, I've been using my shower shoes."
01:24:17.302,01:24:19.513,"Okay, I love you, too."
01:24:21.682,01:24:22.933,"What up, Mrs. Junk?"
01:24:40.701,01:24:42.036,Go!
01:24:44.371,01:24:46.081,"Well, what are you doing?"
01:24:46.081,01:24:48.375,I'm soloing here!
01:24:48.375,01:24:50.377,-Whatever!
01:24:59.053,01:25:02.222,-No.
01:25:14.150,01:25:16.653,"Bumper and Fat Amy, we belong."
01:26:06.202,01:26:07.370,"Oh. Oh, all right."
01:26:07.370,01:26:09.164,"Oh, I love kissing."
01:26:10.582,01:26:12.709,"All right, let's go."
01:26:15.211,01:26:16.880,"-I mean, we can do..."
01:26:16.880,01:26:20.175,Do you want it-- do you-- Do you feel like you wanna layer a bunch of voices?
01:26:21.551,01:26:24.220,I think in the beginning it could definitely build.
01:26:24.220,01:26:26.556,-Mm-hmm.
01:26:26.556,01:26:29.059,"Get your cute butt in the studio, then."
01:26:29.059,01:26:32.228,"Don't tell my boss that we're in here, by the way."
01:26:35.482,01:26:39.235,"-Wow, this is the real deal."
01:26:39.235,01:26:41.030,"-Hey, don't touch anything, Legacy."
01:26:41.030,01:26:43.365,"You're very pretty, but you seem clumsy."
01:26:43.365,01:26:46.242,-Great.
01:26:52.666,01:27:15.271,"getting me through Okay, so-- so you produced this?"
01:27:15.271,01:27:17.774,"-Uh, yes."
01:27:17.774,01:27:19.860,-Who's Emily?
01:27:17.774,01:27:21.611,-I-- -This tall drink of water right there.
01:27:21.611,01:27:23.279,Well...
01:27:23.279,01:27:25.448,"Um, gosh, I d-d-d..."
01:27:25.448,01:27:27.367,I don't-- I don't like it.
01:27:27.367,01:27:33.040,What it is is that I don't-- don't like it when people can do what I can do.
01:27:33.040,01:27:35.959,"You know, in a manner of speaking, it-- it's threatening."
01:27:35.959,01:27:39.295,"But, uh, you-- you just did it."
01:27:39.295,01:27:46.887,"And I-- I have a f-- a few notes that I assume you're open to, -Yes."
01:27:45.135,01:27:49.014,"-but this is a solid demo with, uh-- with real potential."
01:27:49.014,01:27:51.725,"Yeah, I look, uh-- I look forward to working together."
01:27:51.725,01:27:54.019,"-Mm-hmm, it's nice to meet you, Steph-- what is it?"
01:27:54.019,01:27:55.478,-S-- Elizabeth?
01:27:55.478,01:27:57.313,Elizabeth.
01:27:57.313,01:27:59.315,-Thank you.
01:27:59.315,01:28:01.235,I gotta jump on a call.
01:28:01.235,01:28:02.736,"Yeah. Oh, no, it's-- no, get it in there."
01:28:02.736,01:28:04.404,There.
01:28:04.404,01:28:07.574,-One of these and one of those.
01:28:07.574,01:28:09.034,"Good job, Reggie."
01:28:09.034,01:28:10.326,I'm Reggie.
01:28:10.326,01:28:13.163,"Oh, my God! I was so nervous."
01:28:13.163,01:28:15.331,"-Oh, my God!"
01:28:15.331,01:28:17.333,"You know, muchacha, we're gonna be late!"
01:28:17.333,01:28:19.044,We're taking the photo with or without you.
01:28:19.044,01:28:21.337,We are taking the photo with or without you.
01:28:21.337,01:28:24.133,Everybody get together.
01:28:24.133,01:28:26.342,"One, two, three!"
01:28:26.342,01:28:28.095,Bellas for life!
01:28:28.095,01:28:30.180,Whoo!
01:28:39.481,01:28:48.615,"having a good time, -Okay, so..."
01:28:48.615,01:28:51.701,Is there a restaurant in this town that serves something other than fish?
01:28:51.701,01:28:53.245,"Oh, I did see a KFC back there."
01:28:53.245,01:28:55.371,-Nope. All fish. I checked.
01:28:55.371,01:28:57.207,Come this way.
01:28:57.207,01:28:58.625,"Oh, Chloe, I'm coming for you!"
01:29:00.252,01:29:02.378,Whoo-hoo!
01:29:02.378,01:29:04.380,"-Spreading my wings, y'all."
01:29:04.380,01:29:06.716,There are so many fresh Danishes here.
01:29:06.716,01:29:11.138,"I swear, if I wasn't recently locked down, I would tear a hole through this city."
01:29:12.430,01:29:14.474,This place is so smelly and rainy.
01:29:14.474,01:29:16.726,Why do Americans ever leave America?
01:29:16.726,01:29:19.896,"Culture, design, history."
01:29:19.896,01:29:22.732,Copen-hating this place.
01:29:22.732,01:29:27.403,don't we go visit -Hayden Christian Andersen's house?
01:29:27.403,01:29:30.406,But he was pretty crappy in the Star Wars prequels.
01:29:37.206,01:29:39.708,"Well, here we are."
01:29:39.708,01:29:41.960,Do you think the stage is big enough for what we wanna do?
01:29:41.960,01:29:44.504,"You're kidding, right?"
01:29:44.504,01:29:46.298,You guys think it'll work?

01:31:26.148,01:31:28.442,-Okay.
01:31:26.148,01:31:30.777,-Maybe when the Koreans are out there because no one cares about the Korean group.
