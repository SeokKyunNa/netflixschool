00:01:08.375,00:01:09.208,Keep it down!
00:01:15.208,00:01:18.333,"Succulent. And, Isola..."
00:01:19.291,00:01:20.916,your gin...
00:01:30.416,00:01:32.416,-I'll take him back over the fields. -Sod 'em!
00:01:33.250,00:01:43.291,"This is our island, our home, not theirs. Those square-headed buggers can shove-- -Halt! Stand back! -Papers!"
00:01:54.000,00:01:55.791,"-The pig was beautiful, Dawsey. -Ssh!"
00:01:59.000,00:02:01.541,"-That bloody pie, though... -You're breaking curfew."
00:02:02.333,00:02:04.625,What is the purpose of your assembly?
00:02:08.166,00:02:10.250,"We have a book club, you see."
00:02:11.541,00:02:20.041,"You know, the authorities are trying to encourage cultural association -as part of your model occupation. -Yes, yes. Book lovers, that's us."
00:02:27.041,00:02:31.291,-The Guernsey Literary and-- -Bloody potato peel pie!
00:02:31.375,00:02:36.166,The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie-- Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.
00:02:36.250,00:02:37.750,Yes. Should be on the list.
00:02:38.125,00:02:39.708,Guernsey Literary...
00:02:40.791,00:02:43.583,"You're not confiscating potato peelings yet, are you?"
00:02:47.291,00:02:51.125,This is an illegal assembly. You will come with us. All of you!
00:02:57.583,00:02:58.583,"You all right, Eben?"
00:02:59.583,00:03:01.375,Shall I help put him into your car?
00:03:01.625,00:03:03.208,You will register this group...
00:03:07.666,00:03:08.500,Thank you.
00:03:38.500,00:03:40.125,"Oh, so The Times have been on to me."
00:03:40.375,00:03:41.500,Fresh paint!
00:03:42.500,00:03:43.958,When was the last time you saw that?
00:03:44.583,00:03:45.416,Oh!
00:03:45.833,00:03:48.416,One might almost believe the war is really over.
00:03:49.875,00:03:51.416,"Yes, they want you to do an article."
00:03:51.500,00:03:52.375,About reading.
00:03:52.791,00:03:57.125,"Oh, no. Sidney, no. I don't think I'm much up for any more of Izzy."
00:03:57.416,00:03:59.125,"Actually, they want Juliet Ashton."
00:03:59.416,00:04:01.500,It's your own voice this time. I've said yes.
00:04:01.583,00:04:02.583,Oh! Have you?
00:04:04.125,00:04:06.458,"Well, you might have said no, and I make better decisions."
00:04:06.916,00:04:09.291,"So your book tour starts Monday week, Bath to Yorkshire."
00:04:09.375,00:04:11.250,The Times will fill the gap nicely.
00:04:12.833,00:04:13.666,There we are.
00:04:18.416,00:04:19.250,Our stop.
00:04:25.041,00:04:27.125,Have you always wanted to be a writer?
00:04:27.208,00:04:28.541,Always. Yes.
00:04:28.625,00:04:29.750,It's the perfect job.
00:04:30.125,00:04:33.000,"Sitting indoors, and always near a teapot."
00:04:35.208,00:04:36.833,It has its ups and downs.
00:04:36.916,00:04:40.625,"My first book, A Critical Biography of Anne BrontÃ«, sold only..."
00:04:41.208,00:04:42.458,"How many copies, Sidney?"
00:04:43.125,00:04:44.916,"My publisher, Mr. Sidney Stark."
00:04:45.125,00:04:46.333,Twenty-eight copies.
00:04:47.458,00:04:48.291,Worldwide.
00:04:49.875,00:04:53.208,Why Izzy Bickerstaff? Why not write under your own name?
00:04:55.375,00:05:01.375,"Well, I'm not sure which came to me first, Izzy's name or his voice."
00:05:02.208,00:05:07.250,"In either case, they both seemed to suit the tone of the task, much better than my own."
00:05:10.458,00:05:14.666,"I'm not sure I'd call Izzy a book, as much as a collection of faintly amusing essays."
00:05:17.916,00:05:18.750,"Yes, I am."
00:05:20.041,00:05:23.500,"English Foibles, a miscellany of English absurdity."
00:05:24.000,00:05:27.583,"For example, there's a London Society for Public Decency..."
00:05:28.916,00:05:31.875,which advocates trousers for horses.
00:05:46.875,00:05:50.666,"Ah! A pleasure to meet you, Miss Ashton. A delight."
00:05:50.833,00:05:52.541,I'm such a huge fan.
00:05:52.625,00:05:54.291,Oh! Thank you.
00:05:54.375,00:05:57.583,"Poor old Izzy, eh? Had no use for a war, did he?"
00:05:58.375,00:06:00.416,Only wanted to be left alone with his pint.
00:06:01.791,00:06:02.625,Here we are.
00:06:03.666,00:06:08.250,"Quite frankly, Izzy Bickerstaff's why you get first dibs here, Miss Ashton."
00:06:09.291,00:06:11.333,But you mustn't dally. No.
00:06:11.916,00:06:14.625,It's sure to go in a flash!
00:06:53.583,00:06:54.708,Father's paperweight!
00:06:57.208,00:06:58.041,Juliet?
00:06:58.750,00:07:01.541,Where are you? Come back from the edge! No!
00:07:06.500,00:07:07.458,It's all right.
00:07:14.291,00:07:15.833,"Oh, yes, yes. It's very nice."
00:07:17.375,00:07:18.208,Do you...
00:07:19.458,00:07:20.708,"see the crystal, Juliet?"
00:07:23.041,00:07:23.875,Lovely.
00:07:25.291,00:07:27.583,Wonderful view of Kensington Gardens.
00:07:29.000,00:07:30.625,"Albert Hall, around the corner."
00:07:31.625,00:07:33.000,It's a steal at this price.
00:07:35.416,00:07:36.541,It is beautiful.
00:07:36.625,00:07:38.458,I knew you'd love it.
00:07:40.500,00:07:42.333,I'm terribly sorry.
00:07:47.541,00:07:49.833,"At long last, you can afford something smart. Rejoice!"
00:07:49.916,00:07:51.333,I feel a complete fraud here.
00:07:51.416,00:07:57.041,"Juliet, you really do need something better than a poky bedsit in Battersea with three suitcases and a typewriter."
00:07:57.125,00:07:59.250,"-I realize. -Oh, I see."
00:08:00.000,00:08:02.000,"Poor thing, you feel you haven't suffered enough."
00:08:02.083,00:08:03.500,"Oh, I expect not."
00:08:04.458,00:08:05.625,"Well, far be it for me to..."
00:08:06.375,00:08:08.666,"relieve you of your solemn duties, but I'll tell you what."
00:08:09.250,00:08:16.541,"We will buy new flats for everyone else in London who was bombed out, just as soon as Izzy hits number one. Will that make it better?"
00:08:18.333,00:08:19.583,It is a strong start.
00:08:25.000,00:08:26.541,"It is a proper home, Sidney."
00:08:27.875,00:08:28.833,It's just not mine.
00:08:42.666,00:08:44.875,-Excuse me. -Come on! Don't be shy!
00:08:50.583,00:08:51.416,Coming through!
00:08:53.875,00:08:56.666,"Well, you'll need an enormous window to put your desk in front of."
00:08:56.750,00:08:59.708,"'Cause you don't get enough sun as it is. Waiter, I'll keep the bottle."
00:09:00.916,00:09:02.583,A fireplace to keep you warm...
00:09:03.500,00:09:04.583,when you're not with me.
00:09:04.666,00:09:08.541,"Markham Reynolds, diplomat and clairvoyant!"
00:09:09.416,00:09:11.375,-You're a wonder! -At your service.
00:09:12.875,00:09:13.708,Right?
00:09:14.708,00:09:17.958,"But what good is a window, if I haven't given you a view?"
00:09:31.833,00:09:32.666,Watch this.
00:09:50.125,00:09:51.500,Mr. Reynolds!
00:09:51.583,00:09:53.166,I've asked you to stop.
00:09:53.291,00:09:54.833,"Oh, God, you've been caught."
00:09:54.916,00:09:56.416,Yet still you persist. Look at this.
00:09:57.000,00:10:02.541,"Do you imagine I've got a storeroom just brimming with vases -for my tenants to use? -I apologize again, Mrs. Burns."
00:10:03.125,00:10:03.958,Times are tough.
00:10:04.375,00:10:05.750,"Florists, they need the work."
00:10:06.458,00:10:07.291,Flowers.
00:10:07.875,00:10:09.916,I hope she knows what a lucky girl she is.
00:10:10.500,00:10:13.250,"-Come on! -Goodbye, Mrs. Burns."
00:10:15.250,00:10:16.916,-Good night. -Good night.
00:10:18.625,00:10:19.916,-Your mail. -Ah!
00:10:20.291,00:10:21.750,-Thank you. -And your flowers.
00:10:21.833,00:10:25.833,"Oh! Oh, please, keep the flowers for yourself, Mrs. Burns, won't you?"
00:10:26.083,00:10:27.708,Oh! Thank you!
00:10:28.500,00:10:31.708,"No more typing now, Miss Ashton. It's well after ten."
00:10:31.833,00:10:32.666,OK.
00:10:33.083,00:10:36.416,"The sound of that clatter, worse than gunfire."
00:10:42.333,00:10:43.583,Forwarded from Oakley Street.
00:10:49.750,00:10:51.958,"Dear Miss Ashton, my name is Dawsey Adams."
00:10:52.333,00:10:54.541,I live on my farm on the Island of Guernsey.
00:10:55.541,00:10:56.375,Guernsey?
00:11:05.708,00:11:15.166,"I know of you because I have an old book, The Selected Essays of Elia, by Charles Lamb, that has your name and address written inside."
00:11:18.375,00:11:22.625,"There wasn't much else to do here during the occupation, and Charles Lamb made me laugh."
00:11:22.958,00:11:25.083,Especially when he wrote about the roast pig.
00:11:26.583,00:11:36.708,"I am part of a book club, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, that we actually formed because we had to keep a roast pig secret from the Germans."
00:11:37.416,00:11:41.875,"So, I like Charles Lamb. Which is why I'm writing to you."
00:11:42.166,00:11:45.833,"The Germans are gone now, but there are no bookshops left on Guernsey."
00:11:46.750,00:11:52.291,"I am looking for a copy of Charles Lamb's Tales from Shakespeare, which I understand he wrote for children."
00:11:52.875,00:11:55.458,Could you send me the address of a bookshop in London?
00:11:56.208,00:11:57.541,I hope not to trouble you.
00:11:58.291,00:11:59.125,Dawsey Adams.
00:12:00.166,00:12:04.750,"Dear Mr. Adams, I am so pleased your letter found me and that my book found you."
00:12:05.750,00:12:10.000,"It was a sad wrench to part from Mr. Lamb, but I was rather low on funds at the time."
00:12:11.041,00:12:17.000,Perhaps there is some secret sort of homing instincts in books that brings them to their perfect readers.
00:12:17.541,00:12:19.416,How delightful if that were true.
00:12:20.041,00:12:21.666,-Here you are. -I'll take it.
00:12:24.000,00:12:30.083,"I have located Lamb's Shakespeare, and I'm happy to present it to you, in exchange for the answers to three questions."
00:12:30.375,00:12:33.083,Why did a roast pig have to be kept a secret?
00:12:33.375,00:12:36.500,How could a pig cause you to begin a literary society?
00:12:36.583,00:12:41.625,"And, most pressing of all, what is a potato peel pie?"
00:13:12.333,00:13:13.291,Excuse me.
00:13:17.833,00:13:18.666,Wow!
00:13:23.208,00:13:24.041,Welcome.
00:14:04.541,00:14:07.958,That dress is too lovely to have a cloud parked on your forehead.
00:14:19.083,00:14:22.666,"Do you ever feel like we've emerged from a long, black tunnel into a carnival?"
00:14:24.791,00:14:26.125,Do you not like carnivals?
00:14:31.375,00:14:34.000,"After a long, black tunnel, a carnival's wonderful!"
00:14:34.708,00:14:35.583,Let's dance.
00:14:49.208,00:14:51.500,"You know, I've been giving some more thought to your view."
00:14:52.833,00:14:55.208,Sidney's lined up some more flats for me to see.
00:14:55.291,00:14:57.500,-It's just making the time. -It's occurred to me...
00:14:58.250,00:15:01.166,there's apartments on Fifth Avenue. Look out over Central Park.
00:15:04.333,00:15:07.291,"With views of the lake, the entire reservoir."
00:15:09.250,00:15:12.041,There's even a little pond where kids sail model boats.
00:15:14.041,00:15:15.458,I've never been to New York.
00:15:16.625,00:15:18.666,It'll be really fun to show you my city.
00:15:20.833,00:15:22.416,Something worth thinking about.
00:16:10.250,00:16:11.125,Oh!
00:16:20.000,00:16:26.125,"thank you for finding me a copy of Mr. Lamb's Tales from Shakespeare, and even more for sending it as a gift."
00:16:26.625,00:16:30.083,I am happy to settle this debt by answering your questions.
00:16:40.250,00:16:48.916,"A roast pig had to be kept a secret, because the Germans took all our animals away in 1940 to feed their soldiers on the continent."
00:16:49.000,00:16:50.125,This is my farm!
00:16:50.291,00:16:51.541,-Halt! -These are my pigs!
00:16:51.833,00:16:54.083,It was against the law to keep even one.
00:17:01.166,00:17:02.000,Yes.
00:17:04.750,00:17:06.666,They ordered me to grow potatoes.
00:17:11.583,00:17:14.875,Food was already scarce by the first winter of the occupation.
00:17:15.333,00:17:17.583,A proper meal was had only in memory.
00:17:18.333,00:17:26.833,"Like our radios, which they had taken, and the post, which they had suspended, and the telegraph cables that they'd cut."
00:17:27.583,00:17:29.833,We lived our lives in isolation.
00:17:31.208,00:17:32.125,Then one day...
00:18:01.208,00:18:02.166,Mrs. Maugery.
00:18:04.916,00:18:06.041,How can I help?
00:18:06.875,00:18:08.583,See? I told you he'd come.
00:18:16.541,00:18:17.583,"Hey, old girl!"
00:18:17.666,00:18:20.250,While Mrs. Maugery had hidden the pig away...
00:18:20.333,00:18:22.250,I hope you don't think less of me.
00:18:23.875,00:18:28.125,...the idea of roasting it and hosting a dinner belonged to Elizabeth McKenna.
00:18:46.583,00:18:49.625,but it was Elizabeth who realized our true starvation...
00:18:51.416,00:18:56.958,"for connection, the company of other people, for fellowship."
00:19:01.791,00:19:03.291,-Amelia? -Oh!
00:19:04.625,00:19:07.958,"-Thank you so much for having me. -Oh, it's a pleasure! Oh, my goodness!"
00:19:10.958,00:19:16.958,"provided the gin, which she makes herself, along with other herbal remedies and home cures."
00:19:18.541,00:19:20.041,That's all we've got tonight.
00:19:20.541,00:19:21.375,Oh!
00:19:29.416,00:19:30.250,Miss Pribby.
00:19:37.791,00:19:38.625,Thank you.
00:19:41.125,00:19:42.083,-Cheers. -Cheers.
00:20:02.291,00:20:04.541,Dawsey! Didn't know you'd be here!
00:20:04.750,00:20:06.916,"-Evening, Eben. -Ah! Amelia..."
00:20:10.291,00:20:12.583,An entirely new creation.
00:20:15.125,00:20:16.833,A potato peel pie.
00:20:16.916,00:20:18.500,"No butter, no flour."
00:20:19.083,00:20:20.958,Just potatoes...
00:20:22.333,00:20:24.041,and potato peelings.
00:20:27.291,00:20:30.833,"Pat, Pat Murphy, was getting on a bit, and he sort of lost his spark."
00:20:33.416,00:20:46.083,"It was Elizabeth we had in common. And, for a few hours, she brought us together, helped us forget the occupation, the Germans, war, everything we had lost, and to remember our humanity."
00:20:46.375,00:20:50.291,"It was for her husband, and he was found underneath his wife."
00:21:00.208,00:21:01.625,What is the name of your club?
00:21:04.791,00:21:10.708,"After that, we had no choice but to make the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society real."
00:21:34.666,00:21:35.708,Yes! Take that!
00:21:36.125,00:21:37.458,Whatever you can find.
00:21:42.791,00:21:45.125,And this is how I came to know Charles Lamb.
00:22:02.125,00:22:03.291,"OK. Let's go, go, go, go!"
00:22:09.375,00:22:11.083,-Anyone interested? -Yeah.
00:22:11.166,00:22:13.208,"-Well, let Dawsey... -I wouldn't want to read that."
00:22:18.166,00:22:19.791,-W.B. Yeats. -Not for me.
00:22:21.416,00:22:24.541,"whereof she spoke, and she spoke most elegantly."
00:22:24.916,00:22:27.791,Manners is what holds a society together.
00:22:28.166,00:22:30.833,"That, and a reliable postal service."
00:22:33.625,00:22:39.583,"At bottom, propriety is concern for other people."
00:22:40.958,00:22:50.333,"When that goes out the window, the gates of hell are shortly opened, and ignorance is king."
00:22:50.500,00:22:51.333,Shh!
00:22:57.125,00:22:58.833,The monitor never returned.
00:23:01.458,00:23:04.083,Our Friday night book club became a refuge to us.
00:23:05.083,00:23:12.791,"A private freedom to feel the world growing darker all around you, but need only a candle to see new worlds unfold."
00:23:14.916,00:23:16.875,That is what we found in our society.
00:23:22.250,00:23:23.958,But I don't need to tell you this.
00:23:24.750,00:23:26.500,You already know what books can do.
00:23:27.750,00:23:29.083,That's something we share...
00:23:30.375,00:23:31.875,different as our lives may be.
00:23:50.166,00:23:54.000,"Dear Mr. Adams, books have been a refuge for me too."
00:24:05.083,00:24:08.666,"When I lost my parents, it was the world of books where I made my home."
00:24:08.916,00:24:11.291,They saved me. Absolutely.
00:24:12.541,00:24:16.708,"I beg your forgiveness in advance in inviting myself, but I must come and meet your society."
00:24:16.791,00:24:21.375,I so hope that you might allow me to sit in on your meeting and to learn more of your story.
00:24:22.083,00:24:26.375,Let's lay the blame at Charles Lamb's feet in allowing me to think I might be welcome at all.
00:24:29.416,00:24:31.666,"Yours sincerely, Juliet Ashton."
00:24:34.458,00:24:37.375,"P.S. While I am a reader first, I am also a writer."
00:24:38.333,00:24:41.208,I offer this as proof that I come to you in peace.
00:24:45.125,00:24:48.958,"-Sidney! Sidney! -Just, just, just... Hold on one second."
00:24:49.041,00:24:51.083,"Dickens, is that-- Mrs. B! Thank you."
00:24:51.333,00:24:56.291,"Juliet, you cannot t go to a book club meeting on the Island of Guernsey."
00:24:56.375,00:24:57.875,It's a leap of faith they'll even let me in!
00:24:57.958,00:24:59.875,You're reading in Cambridge Friday.
00:24:59.958,00:25:02.833,"But this society, they meet on a Friday. I can't wait."
00:25:02.916,00:25:04.708,"I'll only be gone the weekend, back Monday."
00:25:04.791,00:25:06.958,-Edinburgh. -You're in Edinburgh Monday!
00:25:09.375,00:25:12.583,I honestly don't know why we provide you with an itinerary. I don't. I just don't.
00:25:13.000,00:25:15.708,"Well, this is your fault! You said yes to The Times."
00:25:15.791,00:25:17.291,"Excuse me, my fault?"
00:25:18.291,00:25:20.833,"Sidney, what books, what..."
00:25:21.583,00:25:25.375,"reading did for these people, finally I'll have something serious to write."
00:25:25.458,00:25:26.333,Hmm.
00:25:27.250,00:25:29.958,"This wouldn't be just to get out of reading Izzy in Cambridge, would it?"
00:25:30.041,00:25:31.000,Oh!
00:25:32.000,00:25:35.333,You're not-- You're not running away?
00:25:35.416,00:25:37.000,Ha ha ha! You're too funny!
00:25:38.583,00:25:41.625,"Well, I can't imagine Mark would let you get very far, anyway."
00:25:42.208,00:25:43.041,Let me!
00:25:58.833,00:26:00.041,"Yes, I do."
00:26:01.458,00:26:02.375,Say that again.
00:26:03.041,00:26:07.958,"What? I have everything. Mark, it's the English Channel, not the China Seas."
00:26:08.375,00:26:09.208,"Say, I do."
00:26:10.166,00:26:11.833,Or simply say yes.
00:26:14.708,00:26:15.541,What?
00:26:18.666,00:26:19.500,Juliet...
00:26:21.041,00:26:22.875,let me give you your perfect home.
00:26:24.041,00:26:27.625,"I already know mine's with you. Whether it's here, or New York, or..."
00:26:27.916,00:26:28.750,the North Pole.
00:26:31.291,00:26:33.333,I want to make that home together. Ours.
00:26:38.541,00:26:39.958,"Say you'll marry me, Juliet."
00:26:46.541,00:26:47.375,Yes!
00:26:47.458,00:26:51.875,"I know we've only been together for six months, but they've been happy six-- Yes!"
00:26:52.458,00:26:53.500,-Yes! -Yes?
00:27:13.416,00:27:14.833,"Oh, my God!"
00:28:22.875,00:28:23.958,Morning.
00:28:34.000,00:28:35.000,I'll get another load.
00:28:47.666,00:28:48.500,Excuse me.
00:28:49.291,00:28:50.791,I was looking for a place to stay.
00:28:51.583,00:28:52.416,Um...
00:28:53.041,00:28:54.333,Peter! Watch it!
00:28:54.916,00:28:55.750,Sorry.
00:28:57.708,00:29:00.166,Try at the post office. They should be able to help you out.
00:29:01.791,00:29:03.208,-Right. -Heads up!
00:29:06.000,00:29:07.000,Sorry below.
00:29:10.833,00:29:12.666,Thank you. I think.
00:29:21.916,00:29:22.750,Thank you.
00:29:27.125,00:29:29.125,-It's a miss. -What's she want?
00:29:29.666,00:29:31.291,Have I had a chance to ask?
00:29:33.083,00:29:35.416,I was sent from the Crown Hotel.
00:29:35.500,00:29:37.666,"Oh, they're closed. Roof's gone."
00:29:37.791,00:29:39.083,"Yes, I know."
00:29:39.458,00:29:42.541,A man over there said that you might be able to help with a...
00:29:43.041,00:29:44.833,Does he come out from behind there?
00:29:44.916,00:29:48.083,"Not a lot of options at the moment, places to stay."
00:29:48.250,00:29:51.458,Least of them is with Charlotte Stimple.
00:29:53.125,00:29:55.625,"She lets rooms, sometimes."
00:29:56.166,00:29:57.666,Keeps a clean house.
00:30:00.458,00:30:02.625,"Eli can take you up there, if you like."
00:30:02.791,00:30:05.000,"Oh, I wouldn't want him to have to make a special trip."
00:30:05.208,00:30:07.958,"-Well, he has mail to deliver anyway. -Ah."
00:30:09.083,00:30:10.083,"Well, thank you, then..."
00:30:10.666,00:30:11.625,Eben Ramsey.
00:30:12.458,00:30:13.500,Eben Ramsey!
00:30:14.625,00:30:17.958,The Eben Ramsey? Inventor of the potato peel pie?
00:30:19.916,00:30:21.166,But you're why I've come!
00:30:23.125,00:30:24.375,You came for his pie?
00:30:25.333,00:30:26.791,"No, I came for the meeting."
00:30:27.333,00:30:28.750,Of your society.
00:30:29.333,00:30:32.041,"I've been corresponding with a friend of yours, Mr. Adams."
00:30:32.125,00:30:34.708,-The writer. You're the writer. -Yes.
00:30:35.291,00:30:37.958,"Yes, I am. I'm Juliet Ashton."
00:30:39.791,00:30:40.666,You're beautiful.
00:30:40.750,00:30:42.333,Oh! Thank you!
00:30:44.041,00:30:48.500,"Goodness! Eli, get the cart. He'll take you right up to Charlotte."
00:30:48.583,00:30:50.708,"I'll call round, let everybody know you're here."
00:30:52.416,00:30:53.333,A real writer...
00:30:54.333,00:30:55.333,come to see us.
00:31:38.875,00:31:40.083,Five and six a night.
00:31:41.166,00:31:42.000,Wonderful.
00:31:50.666,00:31:52.208,"In advance, if you don't mind."
00:31:54.291,00:31:55.166,Ah. Of course.
00:32:01.750,00:32:03.166,What brings you from London?
00:32:07.166,00:32:08.208,And the bathroom is... ?
00:32:09.500,00:32:10.583,Just down the hall.
00:32:13.083,00:32:14.833,"-The towels are just-- -Oh, I see it."
00:32:15.416,00:32:16.875,-Thank you again. -Oh!
00:32:17.666,00:32:20.375,I need your ration coupons if you'd like milk with your tea.
00:32:20.458,00:32:22.166,Black tea's lovely. Thank you.
00:33:48.333,00:33:50.208,-Good evening. I'm Jul-- -Miss Ashton.
00:33:50.958,00:33:52.333,"Yes, we're expecting you."
00:33:53.083,00:33:54.000,Rather suddenly.
00:33:54.208,00:33:55.416,Oh. I know.
00:33:56.291,00:33:58.083,I do hope I'm not imposing.
00:33:59.333,00:34:00.291,"Well, here you are."
00:34:01.625,00:34:02.458,Come in.
00:34:04.625,00:34:05.458,Thank you.
00:34:07.250,00:34:09.583,"-Miss Ashton? -Oh, Juliet. Please."
00:34:09.666,00:34:13.833,"I'm afraid I've made a mistake in inviting-- No, no, no, no. No, we are thrilled to have you."
00:34:15.958,00:34:18.666,The last real-life author we had was Clara Saussey.
00:34:18.958,00:34:21.291,She read her cookbook to us back in '44.
00:34:21.416,00:34:22.875,Barely escaped with her life.
00:34:25.416,00:34:26.500,We were famished!
00:34:27.541,00:34:28.791,I'm Isola Pribby.
00:34:29.500,00:34:31.666,So happy to make your acquaintance.
00:34:33.375,00:34:35.625,I'm so happy to join you.
00:34:38.458,00:34:40.500,Has Mr. Adams arrived yet?
00:34:40.583,00:34:42.625,-Dawsey. -I've yet to meet him.
00:34:44.708,00:34:45.708,You've conjured him.
00:34:47.625,00:34:49.083,And your society's founder...
00:34:50.375,00:34:52.500,"Your society's founder, Elizabeth McKenna?"
00:34:52.583,00:34:54.333,I'm so looking forward to meeting her.
00:34:54.416,00:34:55.458,You won't be meeting her.
00:34:56.291,00:34:57.125,Oh.
00:34:58.166,00:34:59.458,She's off-island at present.
00:35:04.333,00:35:06.083,-Ah! -We meet again.
00:35:06.625,00:35:07.458,Eben.
00:35:30.541,00:35:32.333,So who's presenting tonight?
00:35:32.416,00:35:34.041,"-Well, you are, of course. -Me?"
00:35:34.208,00:35:38.958,"Yes, we were hoping you'd read at least the first chapter for us."
00:35:39.416,00:35:42.083,None of us having had a chance yet to read it for ourselves.
00:35:42.166,00:35:45.250,-But we can't start without-- -Dawsey!
00:35:49.291,00:35:50.125,Hello.
00:35:50.708,00:35:51.541,Hello.
00:35:55.458,00:35:57.416,-Dawsey Adams. -Juliet Ashton.
00:35:58.166,00:35:59.291,You two have met.
00:36:00.041,00:36:02.458,"In a way, yes. Earlier."
00:36:03.625,00:36:06.208,Nearly killed her on the steps of the Crown today.
00:36:07.041,00:36:09.083,"Oh. Oh, I was thinking in a past life."
00:36:11.333,00:36:13.125,But this afternoon does make sense.
00:36:15.750,00:36:17.000,Thank you again for the books.
00:36:19.375,00:36:20.250,Thank you.
00:36:20.458,00:36:23.291,Miss Ashton was just getting ready to read to us from her book.
00:36:30.625,00:36:31.541,Fair Juliet?
00:36:32.583,00:36:33.416,Here?
00:36:35.083,00:36:35.916,Best of luck.
00:36:36.958,00:36:38.333,See you on the other side.
00:36:44.875,00:36:48.041,-Right. -The presenter usually stands.
00:36:48.125,00:36:48.958,Oh.
00:36:55.416,00:36:56.250,Begin.
00:37:03.666,00:37:04.791,Anne BrontÃ«.
00:37:06.416,00:37:07.250,A Life...
00:37:07.333,00:37:11.583,You think Anne BrontÃ« is better than Charlotte or Emily?
00:37:11.666,00:37:12.500,I do not!
00:37:12.583,00:37:14.958,-The Tenant of Wildfell Hall... -Yes.
00:37:15.041,00:37:17.458,...a more important book than Wuthering Heights?
00:37:17.541,00:37:19.583,"-No, no! -The very idea!"
00:37:21.583,00:37:24.416,I'm saying that Anne is more modern than Emily.
00:37:24.708,00:37:26.833,Particularly with respect to the status of women.
00:37:26.916,00:37:29.708,"More so than Charlotte BrontÃ«, when she wrote Jane Eyre?"
00:37:29.791,00:37:31.708,"Very doubtful. Doubtful, doubtful, doubtful."
00:37:31.791,00:37:38.083,"Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, that I am soulless and heartless?"
00:37:38.458,00:37:43.250,You think wrong! I have as much soul as you! And full as much heart!
00:37:43.333,00:37:46.041,Oh! You did that beautifully!
00:37:46.791,00:37:48.166,I do love Jane Eyre!
00:37:48.583,00:37:59.875,"Jane Eyre? Is that-- As do I! And while Jane's assertion, I have as much soul as you, was remarkable, directed to a gentleman, it only begins to get at the idea of equality between them."
00:38:00.083,00:38:09.166,"In Wildfell Hall, Anne BrontÃ« laid bare the essential imbalance of power between men and women in the suffocating hierarchical structure of Victorian marriage."
00:38:09.375,00:38:13.166,She challenged the conventional thinking of an entire society!
00:38:18.666,00:38:22.166,"Oh, I had no idea! Anne BrontÃ«, she did quite a bit, didn't she?"
00:38:22.791,00:38:26.833,"Well done, Miss Ashton. You kept going against all the arguments!"
00:38:26.916,00:38:32.208,But I'm afraid you've yet to have the full experience.
00:38:32.291,00:38:34.458,"Oh, I find that difficult to believe."
00:38:34.708,00:38:37.500,That's the second attack you've survived today. It was good.
00:38:37.583,00:38:40.666,An authentic potato peel pie!
00:38:42.000,00:38:43.750,Original recipe.
00:38:44.625,00:38:47.833,"No butter, no flour, no..."
00:38:47.916,00:38:50.125,"Well, it's potatoes."
00:38:52.458,00:38:54.541,You'll want this gin quick after.
00:38:56.750,00:38:58.166,"Give a little taste, here."
00:38:58.583,00:39:01.000,-Is this safe? -It's just potatoes.
00:39:01.083,00:39:02.291,Oh! Um...
00:39:14.833,00:39:17.041,It's the worst!
00:39:23.125,00:39:25.375,"The gin's very good, though!"
00:39:25.958,00:39:27.250,She likes mine!
00:39:28.541,00:39:32.083,"Still, Mr. Ramsey, I would love to get the recipe from you if I could."
00:39:32.166,00:39:33.291,She's mad drunk already!
00:39:33.375,00:39:35.333,It would be lovely to include in the article.
00:39:35.416,00:39:37.541,People adore that sort of detail.
00:39:38.333,00:39:39.166,Article?
00:39:41.208,00:39:42.041,What article?
00:39:43.125,00:39:44.291,"Oh, forgive me."
00:39:45.000,00:39:46.583,I've got ahead of myself.
00:39:47.208,00:39:52.375,"The Times has asked me to write an article on reading, and I'd like very much to write about you."
00:39:53.000,00:39:53.833,All of you.
00:39:54.416,00:39:55.416,The society.
00:39:56.000,00:39:58.083,You painted such a vivid story in your letters.
00:39:59.375,00:40:02.333,-You came to write about us? -It's for the London Times.
00:40:03.916,00:40:06.458,"I mean, only with all your permission, of course!"
00:40:06.541,00:40:08.791,I'm sure there are more interesting subjects to write on.
00:40:09.333,00:40:10.541,"Oh, no, but your..."
00:40:10.958,00:40:17.208,"The story of your group, and how it was formed, I'm sure that so many would find it as inspiring as I-- Oh, I don't think so."
00:40:17.291,00:40:19.125,-Oh I'm certain they would. -No.
00:40:21.750,00:40:25.375,I'm sure we're not interested in inspiring the readers of the London Times.
00:40:26.833,00:40:28.041,"Thank you, all the same."
00:40:29.500,00:40:30.666,I see. I'm sorry. I...
00:40:32.416,00:40:34.750,"I'm sorry to press, but I'd like to understand."
00:40:34.833,00:40:36.250,But how could you understand?
00:40:39.625,00:40:40.541,And... and...
00:40:43.916,00:40:45.000,And people...
00:40:45.791,00:40:46.708,people wouldn't.
00:41:03.375,00:41:04.791,I had a dream.
00:41:05.916,00:41:06.750,Come here.
00:41:15.666,00:41:19.000,-And who's this? -This is Kit. Elizabeth's daughter.
00:41:21.291,00:41:22.125,Daddy...
00:41:23.250,00:41:24.875,can we go home now?
00:41:27.041,00:41:27.875,Yes.
00:41:28.458,00:41:29.666,We're going soon.
00:41:45.458,00:41:47.750,I feel I owe you an enormous apology.
00:41:47.833,00:41:49.041,An apology for what?
00:41:51.500,00:41:58.958,"For assuming your friends were mine, for making myself the uninvited guest, and a complete ass!"
00:42:01.208,00:42:05.416,And for imagining everyone would think being featured in the London Times was just a glorious gift.
00:42:05.500,00:42:08.833,Amelia is a private person. I wouldn't give it too much thought.
00:42:10.291,00:42:14.166,"You sent two books to a stranger. You can't be all bad, Miss Ashton."
00:42:15.791,00:42:18.041,I'd feel much better if you called me Juliet.
00:42:21.416,00:42:22.500,Thank you for coming.
00:42:23.000,00:42:26.333,And for letting me put a face to the name... Juliet.
00:42:27.916,00:42:30.083,Oh. Thank you.
00:42:32.166,00:42:33.041,"Good night, then."
00:42:33.958,00:42:34.791,Bouan gniet.
00:42:51.625,00:42:55.000,I believe I mentioned I like to lock my door by nine.
00:42:56.000,00:42:56.875,"Oh, sorry."
00:42:57.458,00:43:01.291,-I... I hope I didn't keep you up. -You did.
00:43:01.375,00:43:03.416,-Ten-fifteen you came in. -I was...
00:43:03.833,00:43:07.291,at Amelia Maugery's meeting with the reading group.
00:43:08.250,00:43:11.250,-There was such a lot to talk about. -I know who you were with.
00:43:11.750,00:43:13.250,And they're never short of talk.
00:43:14.250,00:43:17.000,You just be wise not to believe everything they tell you.
00:43:18.916,00:43:20.000,I don't understand.
00:43:20.583,00:43:23.166,There's more to that story than they like to let on.
00:43:24.708,00:43:26.250,More to what story?
00:43:28.208,00:43:31.083,"Miss Ashton, I have never been one to gossip."
00:43:31.583,00:43:34.208,"So the less said on any of it, the better."
00:43:35.166,00:43:36.083,Well...
00:43:43.250,00:43:45.750,I did read before an audience last night after all.
00:43:45.833,00:43:49.083,"Oh, yes? Your farmer in the dell put you to work, did he?"
00:43:49.625,00:43:51.375,How did Izzy play in the Channel Islands?
00:43:51.458,00:43:54.500,"Actually, they requested that I read from the BrontÃ« biography."
00:43:54.583,00:43:56.333,Blimey! Wherever did they dig one up?
00:43:56.791,00:43:58.166,It was a very big hit!
00:43:58.250,00:43:59.625,"Oh, I'm sure it was!"
00:44:00.291,00:44:03.083,"Oh, stone the crows, Mrs. B! Good morning!"
00:44:03.166,00:44:04.083,But...
00:44:06.416,00:44:08.208,they don't want me writing about them.
00:44:08.291,00:44:11.041,"Oh, a tremendous hit! I get you back early now?"
00:44:11.625,00:44:13.083,"Are you on your way, darling?"
00:44:13.500,00:44:14.416,Well...
00:44:15.041,00:44:18.833,"-Mrs. B, rebook Edinburgh for a week... -No, no. Sidney..."
00:44:19.541,00:44:21.708,-I'm still here. -What on Earth for?
00:44:23.166,00:44:24.125,Listen...
00:44:25.250,00:44:27.458,"Sidney, I have other news."
00:44:27.791,00:44:28.625,All right.
00:44:28.750,00:44:30.416,I'm bracing myself for it.
00:44:32.833,00:44:33.666,I...
00:44:34.833,00:44:36.708,I hope you won't mind giving me away.
00:44:38.166,00:44:39.000,What's that?
00:44:39.083,00:44:40.458,I'm engaged!
00:44:43.125,00:44:44.125,To be married.
00:44:45.125,00:44:46.583,Mark proposed!
00:44:48.208,00:44:49.041,Sidney?
00:44:51.416,00:44:52.250,Sidney!
00:44:55.666,00:44:56.916,"Yes, darling. Hello."
00:44:57.666,00:45:01.250,"Congratulations. That's marvelous news, the best news."
00:45:03.916,00:45:06.416,"-Are you happy? -Yes, happy."
00:45:07.791,00:45:08.625,You sure?
00:45:08.708,00:45:11.000,"Yes! Sidney, I'm very happy!"
00:45:11.125,00:45:12.916,"All right, I'm very happy too, then."
00:45:14.125,00:45:16.500,-And Mark? Mark happy? -Yes.
00:45:18.250,00:45:20.583,"-Mark there with you? -No, he..."
00:45:23.166,00:45:26.000,"Well, he sprung it on me at the boat. I came alone."
00:45:27.333,00:45:30.375,"Sid-- Sidney, hello? Sidney?"
00:45:34.250,00:45:36.416,"One and eleven, please."
00:45:44.000,00:45:45.500,Are you enjoying the Kipling?
00:45:46.333,00:45:47.958,I am. I'm still catching up.
00:45:48.041,00:45:50.125,Didn't have much school in Dereham.
00:45:50.333,00:45:52.291,But the society have taken me in hand.
00:45:53.041,00:45:54.583,I'll be a genius by the end of the year.
00:45:55.291,00:45:56.541,What were you doing in Dereham?
00:45:56.625,00:45:59.625,"It's where I was sent for the war, when they evacuated us kids."
00:46:00.333,00:46:03.416,-I didn't know they evacuated here too. -Right before the occupation.
00:46:03.500,00:46:05.958,"When the Germans were just across the water, in France."
00:46:06.250,00:46:07.875,Everyone knew they'd be coming here next.
00:46:08.541,00:46:10.166,We only heard the night before.
00:46:11.000,00:46:12.375,England sent ships.
00:46:16.000,00:46:17.250,Let's have a look at you.
00:46:20.541,00:46:21.375,Come here now.
00:46:26.958,00:46:28.583,Parents behind the line.
00:46:31.875,00:46:33.500,Only children on the jetty.
00:46:35.125,00:46:37.125,"Take a label, please. Labels!"
00:46:38.791,00:46:40.083,"Go. Go, go, go."
00:46:40.166,00:46:42.166,"Come on, that's it. Quickly, now."
00:46:42.250,00:46:44.708,"Come on, everyone. Take a label. Keep it safe."
00:46:46.708,00:46:47.541,Thank you.
00:46:55.000,00:46:56.041,There.
00:46:56.625,00:46:57.708,"-Eli, here you are. -Good boy."
00:46:59.791,00:47:00.625,There you go.
00:47:01.791,00:47:04.083,Ready for your adventure? Come with me.
00:47:04.791,00:47:05.708,Give me your hand.
00:47:07.333,00:47:10.333,"I promise I'll look after your grandfather, Eli. Don't worry."
00:47:10.916,00:47:16.458,"Even you can't fight the Germans, miss, when they come. And they might come to England too."
00:47:18.041,00:47:18.958,Give me your hand.
00:47:21.750,00:47:25.833,"My father was given this in the Great War, for courage."
00:47:27.291,00:47:30.875,"The thing is, anyone who keeps it close can't help but be brave."
00:47:31.000,00:47:32.291,Even when they're scared.
00:47:33.291,00:47:34.416,Do you feel it?
00:47:37.041,00:47:40.791,"Well, you need to rub it, then. The magic only starts when it gets warm."
00:47:42.333,00:47:43.541,I feel it now!
00:47:43.625,00:47:46.083,"That's a good lad. Now, you bring that back safe to me."
00:47:50.333,00:47:52.791,-There he is. -Strictly no parents in the port.
00:47:57.625,00:47:59.416,"It nearly broke us, that day."
00:48:01.333,00:48:03.750,When the Germans landed a few days later...
00:48:05.000,00:48:06.375,we were only half here.
00:48:08.416,00:48:09.250,Our hearts...
00:48:10.375,00:48:11.833,were already elsewhere.
00:48:19.250,00:48:20.625,It's worn smooth!
00:48:20.708,00:48:22.500,I needed a lot of courage.
00:48:22.791,00:48:25.416,"Oh, cheer up, Eli. You'll give it back to her."
00:48:25.916,00:48:28.416,"There's people coming home all the time, just like you."
00:48:28.916,00:48:29.750,Coming home?
00:48:32.458,00:48:34.208,How long has Elizabeth been gone?
00:48:38.125,00:48:39.291,What a day that was!
00:48:40.000,00:48:42.833,Eli was the first boy down the gangway.
00:48:43.500,00:48:46.958,He'd grown long legs in five years. Who'd recognize him?
00:48:47.666,00:48:49.208,Me. I would.
00:48:51.083,00:48:53.750,Care for a scone? Fresh baked.
00:48:54.458,00:48:56.083,The Germans arrested her in '44.
00:48:56.375,00:48:59.250,-Sent her to the continent. -Arrested her? Why?
00:49:00.750,00:49:02.500,I don't know. I wasn't there.
00:49:03.833,00:49:04.708,And they don't say.
00:49:16.083,00:49:22.291,"I was hoping to bribe you for a tour, in exchange for some of Eben's scones."
00:49:23.291,00:49:24.875,Much better than his potato pie.
00:49:26.500,00:49:28.958,Yes. I hope so!
00:49:29.750,00:49:30.583,Come on.
00:49:31.166,00:49:32.000,Thank you.
00:49:38.750,00:49:40.041,She knows where she's going.
00:49:50.125,00:49:53.916,"Sorry, I would take my shoes off, if it weren't for all the wire."
00:49:54.750,00:49:58.416,Don't you worry about the wire. It's the mines you want to be careful of.
00:49:59.333,00:50:00.166,The mines?
00:50:02.625,00:50:03.458,I'm sorry.
00:50:04.375,00:50:05.750,"Sorry, that's not funny."
00:50:07.791,00:50:09.375,That's not funny at all!
00:50:10.250,00:50:14.250,"They did mine the beaches, though, the whole perimeter of the island."
00:50:15.000,00:50:17.208,"It took some doing, but we finally got it all cleared out."
00:50:18.875,00:50:19.708,You're safe.
00:50:21.583,00:50:22.416,Good.
00:50:26.958,00:50:27.833,What are those?
00:50:28.916,00:50:30.291,One of the German lookouts.
00:50:31.166,00:50:34.125,"They put them up on every point, facing out to sea."
00:50:35.416,00:50:37.791,And they set gun positions all along the coast.
00:50:38.291,00:50:40.166,Turned Guernsey into a fortress.
00:50:40.708,00:50:41.541,Or a prison.
00:50:42.083,00:50:45.500,-You were locked up here. -They locked themselves in with us too.
00:50:47.791,00:50:52.416,"Well, it would take someone cruel to build anything this ugly as these in such a beautiful place."
00:50:53.000,00:50:55.958,"They didn't build them, the Germans. They only designed them."
00:50:56.833,00:50:57.666,"Who, then?"
00:50:59.625,00:51:01.208,"Todt workers, they were called."
00:51:06.875,00:51:10.916,"Sent by the Reich, for labor, from Poland, Russia."
00:51:11.541,00:51:13.666,Worked all day and all night.
00:51:14.333,00:51:18.250,"They were kept in pens, with the sun beating down on them, the rain."
00:51:20.750,00:51:22.500,You wouldn't even treat animals like that.
00:51:24.750,00:51:26.333,We islanders almost starved.
00:51:27.916,00:51:28.750,But they did.
00:51:29.708,00:51:30.541,Starved.
00:51:31.750,00:51:32.583,And died.
00:51:38.166,00:51:39.041,Dawsey...
00:51:39.958,00:51:42.125,"I know that this is none of my business, but..."
00:51:43.208,00:51:45.041,can you tell me why Elizabeth was sent away?
00:51:47.083,00:51:48.166,What happened?
00:51:50.000,00:51:50.958,She helped someone.
00:51:52.041,00:51:53.000,And was arrested.
00:51:53.958,00:51:54.791,Helped someone?
00:51:55.458,00:51:57.291,"Well, do you have any idea where she is?"
00:51:58.125,00:51:59.625,Or have you not even heard from her?
00:52:08.833,00:52:11.708,"-Anything else for you, mate? -No, that's all. Thank you."
00:52:17.416,00:52:19.416,-Hello. -Oh! Juliet!
00:52:19.500,00:52:21.458,What a nice surprise! I thought you'd left.
00:52:21.541,00:52:25.000,"No, not quite yet. And sadly, not without some of your gin."
00:52:25.083,00:52:25.916,Ah.
00:52:26.458,00:52:28.250,"I wanted to get some for my friend, Sidney."
00:52:28.541,00:52:32.208,Sidney? See? I knew you had someone in your heart!
00:52:32.291,00:52:34.541,-Oh. -I could tell it when we met.
00:52:34.625,00:52:37.916,"Well, not right when we met, but shortly after. Such a..."
00:52:40.375,00:52:43.000,...strong feeling. What flavor do you think Sidney would like?
00:52:43.583,00:52:44.458,What are my choices?
00:52:44.541,00:52:46.791,"Well, let's see. We've got anise accented, delphinium dusted..."
00:52:46.875,00:52:49.041,"Isola, how exactly is all this legal?"
00:52:49.500,00:52:50.875,"Oh, I'm not sure it is."
00:52:51.750,00:52:54.125,But the... the sergeant seems to like it.
00:53:03.291,00:53:04.125,Oh!
00:53:04.916,00:53:06.458,"-Oh, yes! -You want some?"
00:53:13.000,00:53:14.708,I did hear about Elizabeth.
00:53:15.208,00:53:16.500,That she was arrested.
00:53:18.541,00:53:21.208,Do you suppose that's why Amelia didn't want me to write about the society?
00:53:21.791,00:53:22.833,Good girl.
00:53:26.208,00:53:27.291,Is it to do with Elizabeth?
00:53:28.708,00:53:29.708,With who she helped?
00:53:31.791,00:53:35.708,The thing you need to understand is that Elizabeth is like another daughter to Amelia.
00:53:36.500,00:53:37.541,Another daughter?
00:53:37.625,00:53:41.125,"After Amelia's daughter, Jane. She and Elizabeth were the best of friends."
00:53:41.833,00:53:45.041,"Elizabeth used to visit every summer from London, since she was a girl."
00:53:45.708,00:53:47.250,That's her cottage over there.
00:53:51.750,00:53:54.916,"She could have left in 1940, in the big evacuations, but..."
00:53:55.875,00:53:57.125,Jane was pregnant.
00:53:58.291,00:53:59.125,So she stayed.
00:54:00.750,00:54:04.958,"For Jane. Then the Germans struck, and it was too late for everybody."
00:54:17.625,00:54:19.875,And that's where I saw Amelia with Elizabeth.
00:54:21.125,00:54:22.000,At the hospital.
00:54:22.750,00:54:26.666,"Jane had got caught in the bombing in town, and went into labor."
00:54:28.041,00:54:29.375,Jane lost the baby.
00:54:30.625,00:54:31.708,And then they lost Jane.
00:54:38.708,00:54:41.291,Leave her. Leave her.
00:54:59.333,00:55:01.375,The Germans came three days later.
00:55:08.416,00:55:10.041,Here they are again.
00:55:10.625,00:55:12.000,How did we let this happen?
00:55:35.875,00:55:38.375,Shame! Shame on all of you!
00:55:38.458,00:55:39.333,Elizabeth!
00:55:39.416,00:55:42.250,"Shame for Poland, for France, now Guernsey! Shame!"
00:55:42.333,00:55:45.666,Come here. Come here. Come on. It's all right. It's all right.
00:55:45.750,00:55:48.291,"-Miss, you have to stay back! -It's all right. She's fine."
00:55:56.208,00:55:58.458,She's not doing anything. She's going to stop now.
00:55:58.541,00:56:01.000,"I'm very, very sorry. All right, but who are you defending?"
00:56:01.083,00:56:02.541,And whose side are you on?
00:56:02.625,00:56:06.333,Both of you. Go on. Go about your duties. Go about your duties.
00:56:09.125,00:56:12.666,I've lost two people already. I can't afford to lose you too.
00:56:14.250,00:56:16.291,"But she has lost her, hasn't she?"
00:56:16.666,00:56:19.375,The Germans have taken Elizabeth.
00:56:26.208,00:56:29.458,That's why I think Amelia doesn't want to talk about the society.
00:56:30.333,00:56:32.208,Why she wouldn't want anyone to write about it.
00:56:32.916,00:56:35.166,Too painful. She's lost so much.
00:56:35.833,00:56:36.666,I didn't know.
00:56:37.083,00:56:39.500,The war goes on. For us.
00:56:40.125,00:56:41.416,Especially Amelia.
00:56:45.750,00:56:48.666,I don't expect it will really be over until Elizabeth's home.
00:56:50.375,00:56:52.000,And Kit's with her mother again.
00:57:12.500,00:57:14.500,-Here's the rest of '40 into '41. -Thank you.
00:58:04.833,00:58:07.541,"Mrs. Maugery? Mrs. Maugery, good morning."
00:58:08.250,00:58:09.333,Miss Ashton! Morning.
00:58:10.333,00:58:11.625,I thought you'd be gone by now.
00:58:12.583,00:58:14.041,"Yeah, I'd planned to, but I was..."
00:58:14.750,00:58:16.875,I was curious and I wanted to do some research.
00:58:17.250,00:58:20.000,"-Well, don't let me keep you. -Research on the occupation."
00:58:20.666,00:58:22.458,"Yes, I gathered that. It wouldn't be about..."
00:58:22.833,00:58:25.041,"-Morning, madam. -...local flora and fauna, would it now?"
00:58:26.166,00:58:28.958,I'm not writing about the society. I promise.
00:58:34.083,00:58:36.125,"I lost people too, Mrs. Maugery."
00:58:37.000,00:58:38.291,People I miss sorely.
00:58:38.375,00:58:41.083,-Everyone lost someone in this war. -My parents.
00:58:43.250,00:58:45.166,I know what it is to be without a mother.
00:58:45.916,00:58:47.625,"If you'd let me, I'd like to try and help."
00:58:48.833,00:58:52.000,Do whatever I can to find Elizabeth and bring her home.
00:58:53.375,00:58:54.208,For Kit.
00:58:56.458,00:58:57.291,Please.
00:59:05.666,00:59:11.416,"Elizabeth Anne McKenna, British national, 28 years old."
00:59:12.708,00:59:14.208,Do you have the date of her deportation?
00:59:14.291,00:59:17.958,"No, not exactly. She was arrested on June 11th."
00:59:19.541,00:59:20.791,-They think she was sent... -Hey!
00:59:20.875,00:59:25.791,"-Yes, sir? -They think she was sent off-island -sometime in the following few days. -Do you know where she was sent?"
00:59:26.375,00:59:27.708,"No, only to the continent."
00:59:28.375,00:59:29.708,Has anyone heard anything since?
00:59:32.375,00:59:33.208,No.
00:59:33.708,00:59:34.583,Um...
00:59:36.166,00:59:37.833,"If anyone can do it, we can."
00:59:38.208,00:59:39.250,"Mark, thank you!"
00:59:40.375,00:59:44.291,The war is not over for them. It won't be. Not until this child's mother is home.
00:59:45.000,00:59:46.416,"Till then, all they can do is wait."
00:59:47.125,00:59:49.416,"Well, I do know a little something about what that's like."
00:59:50.916,00:59:53.541,I told you. Just another day or so.
00:59:53.625,00:59:55.833,"Right, right, right, right. Researching. I got it."
00:59:56.375,00:59:58.958,-Excuse me... -You can't blame me for being a little impatient.
00:59:59.250,01:00:01.833,"You know, I put a ring on a girl and she disappeared."
01:00:04.125,01:00:06.250,Back by Wednesday. We're having dinner with the Cavanaghs.
01:00:07.458,01:00:08.291,Best efforts.
01:00:10.875,01:00:14.166,"-Come on, piggy! -Come on, piggy! Have a little..."
01:00:14.250,01:00:17.583,Come on! Come here! Ready?
01:00:20.541,01:00:21.458,It's a bit loud!
01:00:24.166,01:00:26.041,"Take it! You know, you hold it."
01:00:27.791,01:00:28.875,-Come on. -Right.
01:00:36.125,01:00:37.000,You know it now.
01:00:37.083,01:00:39.125,"Dawsey, I think you may have a problem."
01:00:39.375,01:00:41.708,All right. That's good. You stay here.
01:00:41.791,01:00:43.708,"Kit, the pigs have gone wild!"
01:01:01.250,01:01:02.583,It wouldn't be about them.
01:01:04.000,01:01:05.000,Just the occupation.
01:01:21.208,01:01:24.041,I thought you said they didn't want to be part of the Times article.
01:01:26.750,01:01:30.500,"I'm talking about... I don't know what I'm talking about yet, but Sidney..."
01:01:30.833,01:01:32.458,it's so compelling!
01:01:32.916,01:01:34.000,That date's gone.
01:01:34.083,01:01:37.666,"As bad as it was for us, these people actually had to live with their enemy."
01:01:38.000,01:01:42.625,Any idea when I might be able to tell someone that you'll pop by their shop for a reading?
01:01:42.708,01:01:45.458,"I've been talking to all the islanders, to everyone, their personal stories."
01:01:45.541,01:01:46.375,Juliet.
01:01:46.625,01:01:48.041,All right. I'm all ears.
01:01:51.250,01:01:52.166,I surrender.
01:01:56.583,01:01:57.416,Thank you.
01:01:58.500,01:02:03.166,Dawsey Adams was sentenced to three weeks in jail for the attack and battery of Mr. Edward Meares.
01:02:06.875,01:02:09.333,Dawsey? Attacked a man?
01:02:55.083,01:02:55.958,I'm sorry.
01:03:08.416,01:03:10.250,"I see you, with them."
01:03:10.791,01:03:14.041,"And I hear you, writing away up there, and I worry."
01:03:14.750,01:03:15.583,Very much.
01:03:16.541,01:03:17.791,What story it is that...
01:03:18.291,01:03:19.625,they have you putting down.
01:03:20.708,01:03:23.541,I'm compiling notes on the occupation of Guernsey.
01:03:23.708,01:03:27.916,"Tall tales of her heroic kindness and virtue, I'm sure."
01:03:29.375,01:03:30.500,Elizabeth McKenna...
01:03:31.500,01:03:32.333,was no saint.
01:03:33.208,01:03:35.416,"Well, who among us is?"
01:03:35.500,01:03:36.916,"Mark me, she will be judged."
01:03:37.500,01:03:39.916,Nothing more than a common Jerry-Bag.
01:03:40.833,01:03:46.958,No better than any other of those other little sluts who dropped their knickers for extra rations or for cigarettes.
01:03:48.041,01:03:49.000,For lipsticks!
01:03:49.708,01:03:52.500,Littering the island with their filthy half-German bastards.
01:03:53.583,01:03:55.583,-Half what? -See? I knew.
01:03:56.250,01:03:57.583,I knew they didn't share that with you.
01:03:58.375,01:04:04.083,"Her adorable little secret, being raised in her absence by that lot."
01:04:06.833,01:04:08.791,Are you sure she was talking about Elizabeth?
01:04:08.875,01:04:10.958,I'm not even going to repeat what she said.
01:04:11.041,01:04:12.708,That is an excellent tack to take.
01:04:12.791,01:04:20.458,"Isola, she more than implied, in the least polite way, -that Kit is partly German. -We're all partly something, Juliet."
01:04:22.250,01:04:23.083,And then some.
01:04:23.958,01:04:24.875,Isola...
01:04:26.541,01:04:28.708,-is Kit Dawsey's child? Or not? -Dawsey's child.
01:04:34.291,01:04:35.750,Why does she call him Daddy?
01:04:39.916,01:04:41.375,It's not my story to tell.
01:04:42.291,01:04:45.375,She's four years old. She needs to call somebody Daddy.
01:04:45.708,01:04:48.166,"Presumably, her father would be the best candidate."
01:04:48.958,01:04:49.791,But that's...
01:04:50.791,01:04:51.666,that's not you.
01:04:54.125,01:04:55.625,His name's Christian Helman.
01:04:58.083,01:04:59.666,"And he is a German, Dawsey."
01:05:01.541,01:05:03.750,"-A Nazi, like Charlotte said. -No."
01:05:04.000,01:05:05.958,"No... Yes. Yes, but..."
01:05:07.208,01:05:08.416,Not like Charlotte said.
01:05:10.625,01:05:11.458,He was my friend.
01:05:14.041,01:05:17.791,Frank Hood had a milk cow back in '41. Got into trouble bringing in a calf.
01:05:18.500,01:05:19.791,I don't know why she's carrying on.
01:05:20.541,01:05:26.083,"I can feel two legs right here, -and the nose. -He's a little early."
01:05:27.541,01:05:28.791,I heard the animal from the road.
01:05:29.333,01:05:32.416,It's too noisy for you? We'll try to keep it down.
01:05:34.125,01:05:35.166,What is the matter with her?
01:05:36.333,01:05:37.916,Just sorting that out.
01:05:39.333,01:05:41.666,You're welcome to put your head up inside if you want to look around.
01:05:46.125,01:05:49.541,We don't want trouble. We'll register the birth. If it lives.
01:05:49.625,01:05:50.750,I'm a doctor.
01:05:51.750,01:05:52.583,Let me help.
01:06:00.000,01:06:00.833,Keep it tight.
01:06:04.708,01:06:05.875,Good girl. Good girl!
01:06:08.250,01:06:09.083,Good girl.
01:06:13.250,01:06:14.125,Come on!
01:06:25.083,01:06:26.041,Shh!
01:06:28.125,01:06:29.375,Shh!
01:06:29.708,01:06:31.958,-Shh! -Good girl! Good girl!
01:06:37.125,01:06:38.125,It's good.
01:06:39.125,01:06:39.958,She's good.
01:06:40.500,01:06:41.333,She's good.
01:06:47.208,01:06:48.041,Shh!
01:06:56.875,01:06:57.750,Shoulder?
01:06:59.375,01:07:01.458,Got kicked by a horse when I was a boy.
01:07:03.125,01:07:04.208,Break wasn't set right.
01:07:06.291,01:07:07.166,Do you have pain?
01:07:08.250,01:07:09.916,Only because it keeps me out of a uniform.
01:07:11.750,01:07:12.916,Keeps me from fighting you.
01:07:29.416,01:07:30.708,And then I saw Christian's face.
01:07:34.125,01:07:35.375,It's all right. He's a friend.
01:07:40.333,01:07:42.958,I've always wondered which one of us she meant when she said that.
01:07:45.833,01:07:48.041,They'd met at the hospital where Christian was stationed.
01:07:49.416,01:07:52.208,"They knew how dangerous it was, to both of them."
01:07:53.583,01:07:56.583,"I should have said more. I should have told them to be more careful, but..."
01:07:56.958,01:07:57.791,she was happy.
01:08:43.666,01:08:44.750,Hello.
01:08:46.541,01:08:47.375,Hello.
01:08:48.166,01:08:50.416,What... What are you doing in here?
01:08:51.000,01:08:53.625,"Well, the menu at Charlotte Stimple's is..."
01:08:55.250,01:08:56.083,limited.
01:08:56.166,01:08:57.958,And you find this an improvement?
01:08:58.500,01:09:00.416,It's... It's not London.
01:09:00.833,01:09:02.250,I don't mind. I like it.
01:09:04.833,01:09:05.666,Who's with Kit?
01:09:06.250,01:09:09.250,Amelia's looking after her. We've been finishing the hotel roof.
01:09:09.333,01:09:10.166,Ah.
01:09:14.750,01:09:15.958,Can I buy you a drink?
01:09:18.500,01:09:19.541,A glass of beer.
01:09:23.708,01:09:25.083,"Pint and a half, please."
01:09:32.583,01:09:33.750,Here you are.
01:09:36.416,01:09:37.250,Thank you.
01:09:40.791,01:09:41.625,What?
01:09:42.291,01:09:43.125,Well...
01:09:45.416,01:09:47.083,You are not what I expected.
01:09:47.875,01:09:48.708,No?
01:09:49.750,01:09:52.916,"How did you imagine me, Mr. Adams, when you wrote me a letter?"
01:09:56.458,01:09:58.916,"Tweed hunting skirt, very..."
01:09:59.666,01:10:01.000,large in the bottom.
01:10:02.333,01:10:05.625,Teeth like a horse. Few wisps of ginger-gray hair.
01:10:05.958,01:10:08.541,And glasses thick as jam jars.
01:10:08.625,01:10:10.083,She sounds lovely!
01:10:13.125,01:10:13.958,And you?
01:10:15.625,01:10:17.500,Who was the pig farmer you send books to?
01:10:18.208,01:10:19.458,I did have a couple of ideas.
01:10:20.916,01:10:22.625,But it was more of a sense...
01:10:23.541,01:10:26.333,that I was writing to someone who already understood me...
01:10:30.416,01:10:32.916,"I didn't have to explain myself to, too much."
01:10:39.875,01:10:41.166,How many of these have you had?
01:10:41.625,01:10:42.458,Oh!
01:10:43.333,01:10:45.458,"Well, I suppose it was because of Charles Lamb."
01:10:45.625,01:10:46.875,"To Charles Lamb, then."
01:10:46.958,01:10:48.833,-Yes. -Contented with little...
01:10:50.166,01:10:52.208,-yet wishing for more. -Ah.
01:10:53.833,01:10:54.666,Bravo.
01:11:03.750,01:11:05.375,Their mouths are clean of lies.
01:11:05.958,01:11:09.125,"But man with goad and whip, breaks up their fellowship."
01:11:10.333,01:11:20.958,"When he has ploughed his land, he says, 'They understand.' But the beasts in stall together, freed from the yoke and tether, say as the torn flanks smoke..."
01:11:21.458,01:11:42.541,"'Nay, 'twas the whip that spoke.' He told you about Christian."
01:11:44.125,01:11:44.958,You know.
01:11:46.625,01:11:47.833,"Some, yes."
01:11:51.125,01:11:52.375,Why don't you put the kettle on?
01:11:53.541,01:11:54.666,I'll see the others out.
01:11:55.958,01:11:57.958,"-Good night, my darling. -Off to bed now."
01:11:58.083,01:11:59.250,Right. Good night.
01:12:00.000,01:12:02.458,-Night. -Come and give me a kiss! Good girl.
01:12:04.458,01:12:05.666,I was so against him.
01:12:06.875,01:12:08.833,When she brought him here for a meeting.
01:12:11.041,01:12:16.625,"'Rot you!' Murmured the man in a horrible passion, between his clenched teeth."
01:12:17.958,01:12:22.250,"'If I had only had the courage to say the word, I might have been free of you in a night."
01:12:22.958,01:12:27.125,"Curses on your head, and black death on your heart, you imp!"
01:12:27.708,01:12:33.708,"What are you doing here?' The man shook his fist, as he uttered these words incoherently."
01:12:34.541,01:12:36.250,Do you not care that I love him?
01:12:36.333,01:12:37.416,It disgusts me.
01:12:38.708,01:12:39.625,He killed Jane.
01:12:40.375,01:12:43.458,"-He killed my husband. -Christian didn't kill-- Yes, he did!"
01:12:46.250,01:12:47.083,They did.
01:12:49.750,01:12:50.625,Elizabeth...
01:12:52.791,01:12:54.583,please don't put us through this.
01:12:56.541,01:12:57.416,Just end it.
01:12:58.958,01:13:00.625,-I can't. -Why? Why can't you?
01:13:00.708,01:13:02.125,Because I don't want to.
01:13:04.833,01:13:07.125,I couldn't... anyway!
01:13:10.166,01:13:11.000,Elizabeth!
01:13:12.708,01:13:13.541,Elizabeth!
01:13:30.666,01:13:34.416,Christian was discovered sneaking into the camp that night.
01:13:35.541,01:13:38.625,They... shipped him off the next day.
01:13:42.500,01:13:43.833,So I got my wish.
01:13:44.583,01:13:45.416,Didn't I?
01:13:48.458,01:13:50.083,They never did see each other again.
01:13:52.333,01:13:53.958,His ship was torpedoed.
01:13:55.333,01:13:56.458,Just shy of the coast.
01:13:58.833,01:13:59.708,He died.
01:14:00.708,01:14:02.125,Now he's at the bottom of the sea.
01:14:04.041,01:14:05.083,Like my husband.
01:14:07.166,01:14:08.583,Lost in a sea of mud.
01:14:09.583,01:14:10.458,On the Somme.
01:14:14.541,01:14:17.041,And she hadn't even told him about Kit.
01:14:18.833,01:14:19.666,He didn't know...
01:14:20.791,01:14:22.166,he'd left two behind.
01:14:24.416,01:14:25.791,If there's any shame...
01:14:26.625,01:14:27.458,it's mine.
01:14:28.791,01:14:29.708,All mine.
01:14:31.875,01:14:34.000,I failed Elizabeth when she needed me.
01:14:36.291,01:14:38.333,Now all that matters is protecting Kit.
01:14:39.333,01:14:40.291,Protecting Kit?
01:14:42.791,01:14:43.625,From what?
01:14:44.291,01:14:49.708,"If Elizabeth doesn't come home, the child's only living relatives..."
01:14:52.750,01:14:53.791,will be Germans.
01:14:55.500,01:14:56.708,They might come for her.
01:14:56.791,01:14:59.125,No. You said yourself that...
01:15:00.208,01:15:02.458,that Christian didn't even know about Kit.
01:15:03.541,01:15:04.791,And even if he had...
01:15:06.625,01:15:07.458,Amelia...
01:15:08.000,01:15:10.125,-Kit is safe. -You don't know that!
01:15:10.208,01:15:11.708,I promise you.
01:15:12.208,01:15:15.416,"I've seen things I never thought could happen, happen."
01:15:17.375,01:15:19.625,I can't lose another person to the Germans.
01:15:20.916,01:15:21.833,I'm sorry.
01:15:23.375,01:15:24.208,I can't.
01:16:21.000,01:16:23.708,-What do you think you're doing? -You've fallen to their side.
01:16:24.750,01:16:27.666,-I tried to warn you. -And everybody warned me about you.
01:16:28.708,01:16:31.041,Your soul is in mortal danger!
01:16:31.125,01:16:33.708,"Oh, my soul? Thank you."
01:16:34.458,01:16:36.416,But it's my privacy I fear for most just now.
01:16:36.500,01:16:38.708,"Miss Ashton, let us pray."
01:16:39.125,01:16:41.875,I pray you let go of me before I knock you down.
01:16:42.666,01:16:45.083,Now here is a book filled with love...
01:16:46.000,01:16:49.791,and you overlook all of it in favor of judgment and petty meanness.
01:16:51.708,01:16:52.541,"Oh, no, no, no."
01:16:53.333,01:16:55.750,"Seek, and ye shall find, indeed!"
01:16:58.541,01:17:00.666,"It is I that shall pray for you, Miss Stimple."
01:17:02.166,01:17:04.083,But from a far safer distance.
01:17:32.000,01:17:32.833,Juliet!
01:17:35.708,01:17:36.833,I have nowhere to go.
01:17:44.666,01:17:46.125,I think Amelia feels ashamed.
01:17:47.208,01:17:48.916,'Cause she hated them all so much.
01:17:49.875,01:17:52.250,She wasn't able to see that Christian was different.
01:17:53.666,01:17:54.708,The way Elizabeth could.
01:17:55.666,01:17:57.000,Do you think Elizabeth is right?
01:17:58.541,01:17:59.500,"Oh, I know it."
01:18:01.166,01:18:02.208,He was a lovely man.
01:18:04.000,01:18:08.166,All I know of romance in real life is Elizabeth and Christian.
01:18:11.791,01:18:13.875,But tell me about your suitor.
01:18:14.375,01:18:15.916,I want to hear all about your Sidney.
01:18:18.083,01:18:19.875,"Actually, Sidney is my publisher."
01:18:20.791,01:18:22.041,And my oldest friend in the world.
01:18:23.416,01:18:24.458,"Still, there's a chance."
01:18:26.041,01:18:29.958,There'd be a greater chance if I were called George.
01:18:31.291,01:18:32.500,Or maybe Tom.
01:18:33.916,01:18:34.875,He likes men's names.
01:18:35.541,01:18:38.083,"Indeed, he does."
01:18:40.333,01:18:41.625,Oh... Oh.
01:18:42.916,01:18:43.750,Yes.
01:18:46.458,01:18:48.458,Oh... thank you.
01:18:50.541,01:18:52.458,"And besides, Isola..."
01:18:54.500,01:18:55.625,I'm engaged.
01:18:56.958,01:18:57.791,What?
01:18:58.833,01:18:59.666,To whom?
01:19:00.041,01:19:02.125,Mark. Markham Reynolds.
01:19:02.208,01:19:03.250,Markham?
01:19:04.041,01:19:05.583,-How elegant. -He's American.
01:19:05.666,01:19:06.541,Oh!
01:19:07.333,01:19:08.416,But where's the ring?
01:19:09.000,01:19:10.375,Or is he very poor?
01:19:10.708,01:19:11.625,That's OK too.
01:19:25.583,01:19:26.416,He's not poor.
01:19:27.750,01:19:28.583,No.
01:19:33.916,01:19:35.375,Why aren't you wearing it?
01:19:36.666,01:19:37.500,"Well, I'm..."
01:19:38.500,01:19:40.208,"I'm not yet used to it, I suppose."
01:19:41.208,01:19:42.708,And I wanted to keep it safe.
01:19:46.750,01:19:49.875,"So, what sort of books does Markham enjoy?"
01:19:53.166,01:19:54.000,Have you...
01:19:55.625,01:19:56.458,Hmm?
01:19:57.958,01:19:59.500,...shared a passionate encounter?
01:20:00.750,01:20:01.875,Isola!
01:20:01.958,01:20:05.208,I have never shared a passionate encounter myself.
01:20:06.250,01:20:08.125,I am only beautiful on the inside.
01:20:09.250,01:20:11.625,You are beautiful on the outside as well.
01:20:12.458,01:20:14.833,-Men do like that. -Nonsense!
01:20:15.416,01:20:17.250,There must be someone here you like.
01:20:17.333,01:20:18.250,No.
01:20:19.125,01:20:20.291,Not at present.
01:20:21.250,01:20:23.166,"But I have Wuthering Heights, don't I?"
01:20:24.791,01:20:26.208,Do you not mind being alone?
01:20:28.250,01:20:29.166,I suppose.
01:20:30.166,01:20:31.000,Sometimes.
01:20:32.625,01:20:36.875,But I think how much sweeter it will be when my Heathcliff finally shows himself.
01:20:38.250,01:20:42.333,And how glad I'll be that I decided to wait for him.
01:20:45.791,01:20:46.625,Careful!
01:20:47.333,01:20:48.500,Good! You're here!
01:20:48.958,01:20:49.791,Hello.
01:20:50.416,01:20:51.458,-You busy? -No.
01:20:52.500,01:20:55.625,New glass for the greenhouse just came in to the port today.
01:20:55.791,01:20:59.000,"I was going to help unload, and I need someone to fetch Kit home."
01:20:59.833,01:21:00.833,"Oh, I'd be happy to!"
01:21:03.791,01:21:05.416,"-All right. -Go on, get off!"
01:21:10.125,01:21:11.208,You're sure it's no trouble?
01:21:14.375,01:21:15.208,Absolutely not.
01:21:19.333,01:21:21.833,"-Come on! -Kit, slow down! Wait for me!"
01:22:35.666,01:22:37.791,Do you want to see my treasure box?
01:22:48.708,01:22:49.833,Delicious!
01:22:58.166,01:22:59.708,This is me and my mummy.
01:23:01.000,01:23:04.708,"She loves me very much, but she can't be here right now."
01:23:06.333,01:23:09.000,And she'll come back as soon as she can.
01:23:20.875,01:23:22.125,She's very pretty.
01:23:33.541,01:23:34.375,Oh.
01:23:35.708,01:23:36.666,Thank you.
01:24:43.291,01:24:44.666,Such a small thing.
01:24:45.541,01:24:46.375,Just a book.
01:24:47.916,01:24:49.500,Yet it's brought me all this way.
01:25:14.750,01:25:16.583,"Kit's in her room, sleeping."
01:25:16.666,01:25:18.041,Thank you for watching her.
01:25:18.708,01:25:19.875,We had a lovely time.
01:25:22.208,01:25:23.041,She's...
01:25:23.541,01:25:24.500,She's fond of you.
01:25:28.750,01:25:29.791,I best get back.
01:25:37.541,01:25:38.458,-Morning. -Morning.
01:25:39.458,01:25:41.625,-Miss! Miss Ashton! -Yes?
01:25:42.000,01:25:44.833,There's a call for you at the post office. From a Mark Reynolds.
01:25:58.333,01:26:01.250,"-He left no message? -No, sorry. We'll try again later."
01:26:01.333,01:26:02.541,"Oh, no."
01:26:03.416,01:26:04.541,"No, it's all right."
01:26:05.166,01:26:06.041,Just...
01:26:06.541,01:26:10.958,"If he calls back, let him know I'm over at the newspap-- -Eben? -Mm-hm?"
01:26:11.833,01:26:16.208,"I hope you don't mind me asking, but who is that man -that's always skulking about? -That one?"
01:26:17.041,01:26:18.791,He steers a wide path of Dawsey.
01:26:18.875,01:26:20.208,"Yeah, I shouldn't wonder."
01:26:21.041,01:26:22.208,That's Eddie Meares.
01:26:22.875,01:26:24.750,The fellow who informed on Elizabeth.
01:26:25.250,01:26:26.541,Informed on Elizabeth?
01:26:27.666,01:26:28.666,Among others.
01:26:31.708,01:26:32.541,Ladies.
01:26:37.041,01:26:37.916,Look at him.
01:26:38.666,01:26:40.500,He's the man Dawsey attacked.
01:26:40.875,01:26:43.500,"Oh, that was a beautiful thing to see."
01:26:44.208,01:26:45.458,Should've sold tickets.
01:26:50.333,01:26:51.333,"Steady, lad. Steady."
01:26:55.500,01:26:57.041,You're doing all right for yourself.
01:26:57.125,01:27:00.041,"-Can't help if business is good. -Oh, Eddie, what business is that?"
01:27:00.500,01:27:03.416,I'd say that jacket's made of Elizabeth McKenna's hide.
01:27:03.500,01:27:05.291,And what business would that be of any of yours?
01:27:07.583,01:27:09.166,That Jerry-Bag wasn't even from here.
01:27:09.333,01:27:11.791,It's just too bad they didn't ship her wee bastard off with her.
01:27:16.583,01:27:17.958,"You're the bastard, Meares!"
01:27:19.291,01:27:31.583,"Or did I get it wrong, Adams? Maybe you shared her with your nasty friend-- They had to give him three weeks, but he only served one."
01:27:32.666,01:27:34.291,"I'd have done it for him, if I could."
01:27:35.208,01:27:36.083,But that one...
01:27:37.708,01:27:39.375,he has to live with himself now.
01:27:40.083,01:27:40.916,God help him.
01:27:46.041,01:27:48.791,"Why does Kit live with you, rather than Amelia or..."
01:27:49.833,01:27:51.541,'Cause Elizabeth left her with me.
01:27:53.750,01:27:54.583,Why?
01:27:59.000,01:27:59.833,Dawsey...
01:28:00.708,01:28:01.708,what happened?
01:28:05.166,01:28:08.708,"She came to the house that night, the night she was arrested."
01:28:10.083,01:28:12.708,"One of the slave workers, a boy..."
01:28:13.625,01:28:14.750,had escaped somehow.
01:28:15.625,01:28:16.500,She'd found him.
01:28:17.583,01:28:18.666,He was hurt.
01:28:19.375,01:28:20.291,Sick.
01:28:21.083,01:28:21.916,Needed help.
01:28:25.416,01:28:26.375,So she brought Kit.
01:28:28.041,01:28:29.083,Would I watch her...
01:28:30.750,01:28:32.166,while she went for supplies?
01:28:32.958,01:28:35.750,You can't go running around the island after curfew!
01:28:37.041,01:28:38.375,I don't have a choice.
01:28:38.458,01:28:41.166,Of course you do! You have a choice! You have a responsibility!
01:28:42.375,01:28:44.416,I won't do it. You can't leave her here.
01:28:44.500,01:28:47.416,-Do you have any bread? -Take her to Amelia or Isola.
01:28:47.500,01:28:50.833,I will be gone for 20 minutes. Do you have any bread?
01:29:04.166,01:29:05.166,Elizabeth...
01:29:07.125,01:29:09.375,Because you give me the last piece of bread when I ask.
01:29:12.250,01:29:13.916,That is why I trust her to you.
01:29:20.541,01:29:21.666,Elizabeth!
01:29:22.500,01:29:24.666,"-Elizabeth! -Dawsey, go back! Watch her!"
01:29:24.750,01:29:27.166,You can't risk it! It's too dangerous! You have a child!
01:29:27.291,01:29:28.500,This is someone's child too.
01:29:28.666,01:29:30.625,How could I look his mother in the eye if I didn't help?
01:29:30.708,01:29:32.041,You will never meet her!
01:29:32.708,01:29:35.458,"If I don't help him, he will die. What would you have me do?"
01:29:35.541,01:29:37.250,-Look the other way? -Yes! Please.
01:29:37.333,01:29:38.708,-I can't. -Please.
01:29:40.416,01:29:43.583,"I'll go. Tell me what you need from the hospital, and I'll get it."
01:29:43.666,01:29:47.166,They'll never let you in. I'll be back. Two shakes of a lamb's tail.
01:30:00.750,01:30:02.333,They shot him by the side of the road.
01:30:12.125,01:30:13.625,And they arrested Elizabeth.
01:30:16.125,01:30:18.083,I should have nailed her to the floor.
01:30:20.291,01:30:21.416,But I let her go.
01:30:22.458,01:30:23.708,It's not your fault.
01:30:25.125,01:30:26.416,-It is. -Dawsey...
01:30:29.125,01:30:30.041,it's not fair.
01:30:30.541,01:30:31.750,The choice she made...
01:30:33.208,01:30:35.500,"to Kit, to you."
01:30:37.083,01:30:39.875,"Raising this child, all by yourself."
01:30:40.125,01:30:41.958,But I... I... I love her.
01:30:42.541,01:30:44.000,Rise and shine!
01:30:50.541,01:30:51.416,I love Kit.
01:30:55.041,01:30:56.166,Do you love Elizabeth?
01:31:04.291,01:31:05.125,Juliet!
01:31:07.041,01:31:08.833,Mark? Mark!
01:31:11.916,01:31:14.166,Mark! What are you doing here?
01:31:29.666,01:31:30.541,Mark Reynolds.
01:31:31.333,01:31:32.166,Dawsey Adams.
01:31:33.125,01:31:36.416,You're the letter-writing pig farmer? Fellow bibliophile?
01:31:37.166,01:31:38.041,It's good to meet you.
01:31:40.291,01:31:42.791,-I hope I'm not intruding. -What are you doing here?
01:31:43.875,01:31:46.291,"If you ask me that again, I'm gonna feel a little unwelcome."
01:31:46.375,01:31:47.958,I missed you. I hope that's enough.
01:31:49.875,01:31:50.750,More than enough!
01:31:51.541,01:31:52.666,I'm just surprised!
01:31:54.250,01:31:56.666,"-That's all. -Well, I tried to call you yesterday."
01:31:57.541,01:32:02.291,"I thought, you know, why not hop on a flight, come see what's so fascinating here for myself."
01:32:03.625,01:32:04.625,I have some idea now.
01:32:07.583,01:32:09.125,"You know, it's a beautiful island."
01:32:10.083,01:32:13.000,It's just... lacking a proper florist.
01:32:13.083,01:32:13.916,Oh!
01:32:16.750,01:32:18.708,"-All the way from London. -Mark, they're beautiful!"
01:32:19.458,01:32:20.291,Thank you.
01:32:22.250,01:32:23.500,How about a private tour?
01:32:24.041,01:32:24.875,Yes!
01:32:27.083,01:32:28.125,Absolutely.
01:32:33.333,01:32:34.958,-Nice to meet you. -Yes.
01:32:40.250,01:32:42.666,You see the one with the greenhouse? That's Isola's.
01:32:42.750,01:32:44.500,That's where I've been staying this past week.
01:32:44.958,01:32:46.666,Do you see it? It's the one with the garden.
01:32:48.250,01:32:49.625,Have you lost the ring I gave you?
01:32:51.041,01:32:51.875,"No, I haven't."
01:32:52.791,01:32:53.833,Have you changed your mind?
01:32:57.833,01:32:59.500,-No. -Then why aren't you wearing it?
01:33:01.916,01:33:03.583,Because I am afraid of losing it.
01:33:04.333,01:33:08.250,I can only imagine what it cost. And I wanted to keep it safe.
01:33:10.625,01:33:11.458,And I...
01:33:12.125,01:33:14.083,-I'll tell you the truth. -That would be great.
01:33:16.833,01:33:17.875,I feel like I'm...
01:33:18.291,01:33:23.333,lording about with a great gold crown on my forehead. Can you understand that?
01:33:24.791,01:33:26.208,My good fortune feels...
01:33:28.791,01:33:30.250,It feels so conspicuous here.
01:33:30.750,01:33:33.250,I take it gold crowns aren't the fashion on Guernsey?
01:33:35.125,01:33:37.125,Or maybe just not on pig farms.
01:33:43.750,01:33:45.416,Or maybe you'd like to take it back.
01:33:51.916,01:33:53.833,"More than anything, I just want to see it on you."
01:33:55.375,01:33:56.541,"Right here, where I put it."
01:34:01.625,01:34:03.291,Unless there's something you want to tell me.
01:34:14.666,01:34:15.500,Good.
01:34:17.291,01:34:18.500,"Now, the real reason I came."
01:34:34.666,01:34:37.625,Mark was able to trace her to a camp in RavensbrÃ¼ck.
01:34:38.791,01:34:39.958,Where's RavensbrÃ¼ck?
01:34:49.208,01:34:51.250,There are witnesses who saw her.
01:34:52.750,01:34:53.625,Who were there...
01:34:53.958,01:34:55.250,the day she died.
01:34:56.083,01:34:58.333,-Do they know how she died? -She was shot.
01:35:06.583,01:35:11.500,They say she tried to save a girl who was being beaten.
01:35:15.666,01:35:16.625,Elizabeth...
01:35:17.375,01:35:20.708,"got the stick from the guard, and she struck him with it."
01:35:22.416,01:35:23.500,The girl was spared.
01:35:25.083,01:35:26.500,But they killed Elizabeth instead.
01:35:32.458,01:35:33.500,I'm so sorry.
01:35:47.333,01:35:48.208,Right now?
01:35:49.208,01:35:51.416,Don't you want to give yourself a chance to think?
01:35:51.500,01:35:53.166,-Think what? -What will you tell her?
01:35:53.250,01:35:54.416,"I'll do it, Dawsey."
01:35:55.250,01:35:56.083,I will.
01:35:56.583,01:35:57.416,Wait.
01:36:11.166,01:36:12.083,Come on.
01:36:13.791,01:36:14.625,Come.
01:36:20.916,01:36:21.833,She's only four.
01:36:23.208,01:36:24.416,What can she understand?
01:36:24.750,01:36:26.041,I'm older than time.
01:36:28.958,01:36:30.416,And I understand nothing.
01:36:33.041,01:36:33.875,Nothing!
01:36:42.500,01:36:43.625,It's time to go.
01:37:05.458,01:37:09.000,It's not like I can keep putting poor Sidney and his book tour off forever.
01:37:10.125,01:37:12.708,-I have to get back to London sometime. -Then there's your Mark.
01:37:13.541,01:37:15.375,Wouldn't want him to go to waste.
01:37:15.791,01:37:16.625,No.
01:37:18.083,01:37:18.916,You see.
01:37:20.916,01:37:22.208,There's nothing to keep you here?
01:37:23.833,01:37:24.666,No.
01:37:25.541,01:37:26.625,My life's in London.
01:37:27.083,01:37:27.916,"Yes, it is."
01:37:31.083,01:37:34.916,"I'm afraid how lonely it's going to feel now, when you're gone."
01:37:37.083,01:37:40.000,It's terrible to lose a friend when you don't have many.
01:38:20.041,01:38:20.875,Thank you.
01:38:35.500,01:38:36.791,"I'm so sorry, Amelia."
01:38:42.416,01:38:44.791,"-Goodbye, miss. -Keep going with the Kipling."
01:38:45.833,01:38:46.666,Goodbye!
01:38:48.916,01:38:49.875,I'll miss you.
01:38:51.458,01:38:52.375,I'll miss all of you.
01:39:01.333,01:39:02.625,This is yours.
01:39:06.458,01:39:07.791,I'd like you to keep that.
01:39:12.541,01:39:14.166,"Juliet, I'll be on board."
01:39:15.166,01:39:17.375,"Mr. Adams, nice to meet you."
01:39:17.458,01:39:18.291,"Bye, Juliet."
01:39:19.500,01:39:20.333,"Bye, Kit."
01:39:22.750,01:39:23.583,Kit.
01:39:34.250,01:39:36.791,"-We'll still write to each other, right? -Yes, of course."
01:39:46.208,01:39:47.041,Goodbye.
01:41:18.458,01:41:20.000,"Thank goodness you're here, Mr. Stark."
01:41:20.250,01:41:23.333,"Poor thing. She's not eating, and she's as quiet as a mouse!"
01:41:23.416,01:41:25.416,"Well, let's see what we can fix."
01:41:25.750,01:41:29.500,"I can tell you, the silence is worse -than the typing ever was. -Hmm."
01:41:34.250,01:41:35.458,You have to write about them.
01:41:36.333,01:41:37.208,I can't.
01:41:38.333,01:41:39.208,I promised I wouldn't.
01:41:39.833,01:41:43.750,"I realize that, Juliet. But this is your story to tell."
01:41:44.250,01:41:48.041,As sure as I'm sitting here. And you will not be right until you do.
01:41:49.708,01:41:53.458,"Now, Elizabeth, for better or worse, couldn't help but follow her heart."
01:41:54.041,01:41:55.041,You must do the same.
01:41:56.958,01:41:57.791,I'm afraid.
01:41:59.833,01:42:01.500,What if I'm not a good enough writer?
01:42:03.750,01:42:04.666,She doubts.
01:42:06.500,01:42:07.541,She doesn't believe.
01:42:11.125,01:42:15.041,"She craves being taken seriously, but then, she won't do that for herself."
01:42:18.333,01:42:19.833,I think you're better than you yet know.
01:42:21.625,01:42:24.541,"And as your friend of many, many..."
01:42:25.916,01:42:27.541,many years...
01:42:32.750,01:42:34.500,I've seen you reach for what you want.
01:42:36.500,01:42:38.041,You have that courage.
01:43:11.208,01:43:12.750,You look absolutely ravishing.
01:43:13.166,01:43:14.000,Thank you.
01:43:14.958,01:43:15.916,We...
01:43:17.583,01:43:19.208,need to celebrate.
01:43:28.041,01:43:28.875,To us.
01:43:39.875,01:43:40.833,"Juliet, what is it?"
01:43:44.250,01:43:45.083,Mark...
01:43:45.708,01:43:46.541,I'm sorry.
01:43:52.625,01:43:53.833,I'm very sorry.
01:44:05.583,01:44:06.625,"OK, is my mistake..."
01:44:07.333,01:44:08.625,bringing you back too quickly?
01:44:09.833,01:44:11.333,Or letting you go to Guernsey at all?
01:44:12.208,01:44:14.000,I should have never let you out of my sight.
01:44:16.083,01:44:18.791,I think I would have found myself here sooner or later.
01:44:19.625,01:44:20.916,Even if I'd gone nowhere.
01:44:23.125,01:44:24.708,"I am sorry, Mark."
01:44:31.000,01:44:32.666,May I ask if you ever loved me?
01:44:33.416,01:44:37.791,"I loved our time together, -and I still truly care-- -Not really the same thing, is it?"
01:44:38.458,01:44:41.875,"-I feel terribly. -Well, I am really sorry about that."
01:44:43.000,01:44:51.375,"Mark, as unhappy with me as you are right now, I know being married to me would not -have made you very happy. -I'd rather you not tell me what would make me happy. I got a better beat on that than you."
01:44:51.458,01:44:53.333,And you deserve someone who can share that.
01:44:53.416,01:44:55.041,-Who can share every wonderful thing-- -OK.
01:44:55.125,01:44:56.000,you have to offer.
01:44:59.083,01:45:00.500,"Well, I deserve better than I got."
01:45:01.333,01:45:02.291,I'll give you that.
01:45:05.041,01:45:05.916,And you will have it.
01:45:06.541,01:45:08.916,"I'm sure I will, but not at this table. Good night."
01:45:20.125,01:45:21.416,"Goodbye, Mark."
01:45:32.000,01:45:32.916,"Goodbye, Juliet."
01:48:01.416,01:48:03.041,Crikey! That's quite a mouthful.
01:48:03.916,01:48:05.125,-No author. -No.
01:48:06.208,01:48:07.750,You can't ever publish it anyway.
01:48:07.916,01:48:09.791,You'd need permission and it's not mine to give.
01:48:11.291,01:48:12.625,This is just for you.
01:48:12.708,01:48:13.541,Thank you.
01:48:15.291,01:48:16.750,-But... -Hmm?
01:48:17.250,01:48:18.500,I will write you another book.
01:48:19.458,01:48:20.916,Possibly another after that.
01:48:21.458,01:48:23.041,This makes me excessively happy to hear.
01:48:26.333,01:48:27.750,"Something's opened up, Sidney."
01:48:27.833,01:48:31.208,"Somehow, the doing has given me a tremendous appetite for more."
01:48:33.833,01:48:35.416,Which brings me to a business question.
01:48:35.583,01:48:37.291,Business? Good.
01:48:37.916,01:48:38.791,I'm all ears.
01:48:41.041,01:48:42.333,Have I still got...
01:48:43.583,01:48:44.750,a little money?
01:48:45.375,01:48:46.208,Ah...
01:48:47.666,01:48:48.500,No.
01:48:49.708,01:48:51.250,"No, you're quite rich."
01:48:53.791,01:48:54.958,"Well, I only need some."
01:48:56.041,01:48:58.250,There's a property I may be interested in buying.
01:49:00.833,01:49:04.125,"But I need to go and see if it's still available, and if they'll have me."
01:49:06.541,01:49:08.708,"Darling girl, anyone would be lucky to have you."
01:49:10.958,01:49:12.791,And I am so lucky to have you.
01:49:20.583,01:49:21.416,True.
01:49:23.166,01:49:26.041,"All right, all right. Off you go. I'm a very busy man."
01:49:27.166,01:49:28.041,All right.
01:49:33.041,01:49:34.000,Just so you know...
01:49:35.291,01:49:37.125,I'm still available to give you away.
01:49:38.833,01:49:41.083,Should the occasion ever present itself.
01:49:43.166,01:49:44.083,"Thank you, Sidney."
01:49:45.791,01:49:46.625,For all of it.
01:50:03.333,01:50:04.208,Granddad?
01:50:06.125,01:50:07.458,It's addressed to the society.
01:50:41.583,01:50:42.708,"Out loud, son."
01:50:43.458,01:50:44.291,Out loud.
01:50:47.125,01:50:57.166,"Dear Dawsey, Amelia, Isola, Eben, Eli, and Kit, Please forgive me."
01:50:57.791,01:50:58.666,Whatever for?
01:50:59.041,01:51:00.000,That's first.
01:51:00.416,01:51:04.666,I hope you will forgive me breaking the promise I made not to write about your society.
01:51:06.458,01:51:09.125,We had a trust I'm profoundly sorry to have betrayed.
01:51:10.916,01:51:17.791,"Secondly, know that this manuscript is yours alone to do with what you will."
01:51:19.375,01:51:20.500,I will not publish it.
01:51:21.041,01:51:22.041,That's not why I wrote it.
01:51:25.291,01:51:32.458,"'Earth seemed a desert I was bound to traverse, seeking to find the old familiar faces.' Charles Lamb wrote."
01:51:33.083,01:51:33.916,Charles Lamb.
01:51:35.791,01:51:43.000,"I feel I have been searching for the old familiar faces for many years now, and can't quite account for why I recognize these as yours."
01:51:45.541,01:51:46.541,-But I do. -But I do.
01:51:48.291,01:51:52.541,Do you suppose it's possible for us to already belong to someone before we've met them?
01:51:53.041,01:51:54.458,"Oh, very much so, yes."
01:51:55.083,01:51:59.583,"If so, I belong to you, or you to me."
01:52:00.666,01:52:03.458,Or me simply to the spirit I found among you on Guernsey.
01:52:05.000,01:52:08.083,That is as good a definition of family as any I know.
01:52:09.458,01:52:12.291,Thank you for sharing the story of your family with me.
01:52:13.458,01:52:14.833,And for sharing Elizabeth.
01:52:16.083,01:52:25.291,"Though I did not get to meet her myself, I feel keenly how her life has changed the arc of my own forever, in ways I am only just beginning to discover."
01:52:26.666,01:52:34.375,"I wish you all peace, and hope that if books do have the power to bring people together, this one may work its magic."

01:53:03.833,01:53:05.708,-Will you read it to me? -I will.
01:53:07.208,01:53:08.416,"Another time, all right?"
01:53:11.458,01:53:13.583,-Who will look after her? -I will!
01:53:13.666,01:53:16.875,"Eli, drive me to the port? I can still make the 11 o' clock boat."
01:53:20.958,01:53:23.458,"You stop her, Dawsey. You stop her."
01:53:24.375,01:53:25.708,Don't let her marry that Yank.
01:53:26.458,01:53:28.250,-I don't believe she is. -How do you know?
01:53:28.333,01:53:29.208,She told us.
01:53:31.875,01:53:34.291,Mind Amelia. I'll be back soon.
01:53:34.708,01:53:35.916,-Bye-bye. -Bye.
01:53:36.416,01:53:38.083,"Well, where's she say that?"
01:53:42.000,01:53:42.833,Come on.
01:53:43.375,01:53:45.750,Let's go make some cakes for when they get back.
01:53:46.166,01:53:47.833,"Amelia, are you not gonna read this?"
01:53:48.416,01:53:51.083,I don't care for everyone to see me crying. I will later.
01:53:55.875,01:53:56.708,Excuse me.
01:54:01.416,01:54:02.250,Sorry!
01:54:12.250,01:54:13.083,Thank you.

01:55:00.208,01:55:01.041,Dawsey!
01:55:06.291,01:55:07.250,"Oh, Juliet!"
01:55:15.541,01:55:16.375,Hello.
01:55:19.125,01:55:20.208,Where are you off to?
01:55:22.416,01:55:24.791,I'm on my way to find you.
01:55:26.458,01:55:27.291,Me?
01:55:28.833,01:55:30.291,-Really? -Yes.
01:55:33.125,01:55:35.625,"Well, I wrote you a letter on the boat, just now."
01:55:37.083,01:55:38.791,Wanted to make sure I got it all down.
01:55:40.916,01:55:42.333,Everything I should have said...
01:55:43.125,01:55:43.958,long before.
01:55:47.666,01:55:48.500,Well...
01:55:49.458,01:55:52.750,"this is convenient, because I was on my way to find you as well."
01:55:58.666,01:55:59.500,Juliet...
01:56:00.458,01:56:02.166,-I... -Would you like to marry me?
01:56:10.875,01:56:12.000,I'm in love with you.
01:56:13.458,01:56:14.375,So I thought I'd ask.
01:56:17.541,01:56:18.375,My God!
01:56:19.875,01:56:20.708,Yes.
01:56:21.625,01:56:22.458,Yes!

01:57:14.916,01:57:22.250,"Lysander, presently opening his eyes and seeing his dear Hermia, recovered his reason, which the fairy charm had before clouded."
01:57:22.708,01:57:26.166,"And with his reason, his love for Hermia."
01:57:27.250,01:57:37.500,"And they began to talk over the adventures of the night, doubting if these things had really happened, or if they had both been dreaming the same bewildering dream."
01:58:02.041,01:58:14.916,"It was time for lunch. 'Besides,' he said, there's the lighthouse. We're almost there.'  is not the author's primary concern, you see."
01:58:19.708,01:58:23.750,It's what's going on inside the people. It's the psychology of the people.
01:58:33.208,01:58:37.291,"-Were you shipwrecked? -Nay, mate. Marooned!"
01:58:37.625,01:58:40.208,"Three years, we've gone and lived on goats!"
01:58:40.291,01:58:42.791,-Three years? -And berries and oysters.
01:58:47.250,01:58:49.666,"-Toasted, mostly. -Well done, Grandpa."
01:59:01.875,01:59:16.166,"Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about mine ears, I took that dear hand, held it a moment to my lip."
01:59:19.958,01:59:22.666,"We entered the wood, and wended homeward."
01:59:23.250,01:59:25.375,"Reader, I married him."
01:59:34.458,01:59:36.166,you look as if your name was Ernest.
01:59:36.291,01:59:38.958,You are the most Ernest-looking person I ever saw in my life!
01:59:39.208,01:59:43.791,It is perfectly absurd you're saying your name isn't Ernest!
02:00:02.666,02:00:04.000,-...alive. -Yes!
02:00:04.083,02:00:07.541,But now I am six. I'm as...
02:00:07.625,02:00:09.333,-Clever. -...clever as clever.
02:00:09.583,02:00:13.000,-So I think I'll be six now for... -Ever and ever.
