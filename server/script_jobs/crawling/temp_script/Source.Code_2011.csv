00:03:00.430,00:03:02.223,It was good advice. Thank you.
00:03:06.102,00:03:07.854,You look pale. Everything okay?
00:03:07.937,00:03:09.314,Sean?
00:03:09.397,00:03:10.565,Sean?
00:03:12.859,00:03:14.152,Hey.
00:03:14.903,00:03:16.738,"Anyway, listen. I wanted to tell you."
00:03:16.821,00:03:24.495,-Goddamn it. -The only reason why I canceled… I hear more from him now than I did when we were together.
00:03:24.579,00:03:25.788,What is it with guys?
00:03:32.754,00:03:34.589,I gave notice.
00:03:39.886,00:03:51.397,"I, uh… Hey. Hey."
00:03:52.774,00:03:54.651,You're acting a little strange this morning. You okay?
00:04:02.909,00:04:04.869,I should punch your face.
00:04:04.953,00:04:07.247,Sean? Did I do something?
00:04:07.830,00:04:10.792,"Look, I can see that you think you know me but I don't know who you are."
00:04:11.376,00:04:13.795,My name is Captain Colter Stevens.
00:04:13.878,00:04:17.590,I fly helicopters for the US Army in Afghanistan.
00:04:21.302,00:04:26.641,"Sean, that's… -Sean? -Glenbrook Station, next stop."
00:04:26.724,00:04:27.976,I feel sick.
00:04:47.203,00:04:48.329,Hey.
00:04:48.413,00:04:49.455,You dropped this.
00:04:49.539,00:04:51.541,-Wow. Thanks. -Appreciate it.
00:05:02.927,00:05:04.387,What is that?
00:05:04.929,00:05:06.472,Chicago.
00:05:17.317,00:05:19.694,This is a Chicago-bound train.
00:05:19.777,00:05:21.279,"You okay there, Captain?"
00:05:35.043,00:05:37.003,Union Station.
00:05:40.757,00:05:42.383,Did you see that?
00:05:48.181,00:05:49.599,You're kind of freaking me out.
00:06:04.864,00:06:06.407,No.
00:06:31.849,00:06:32.934,Oh.
00:06:33.851,00:06:34.936,Are you all right?
00:06:35.520,00:06:37.814,"-I don't know what's going on. -Talk to me, Sean."
00:06:37.897,00:06:40.274,"Look, I don't know who Sean is. And I don't know who you are."
00:06:48.116,00:06:49.909,Okay. We'll get off at the next stop.
00:06:49.992,00:06:51.953,"We'll figure out whatever's going on here, okay?"
00:06:52.036,00:06:53.496,This doesn't belong to me.
00:06:54.497,00:06:57.708,Look at me. Everything's gonna be okay.
00:07:20.565,00:07:22.525,"Captain Colter Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle."
00:07:22.608,00:07:24.193,Acknowledge transmission.
00:07:28.531,00:07:30.366,"Captain Stevens, do you copy?"
00:07:32.493,00:07:33.911,Where am I?
00:07:34.454,00:07:37.582,You're with Beleaguered Castle. Are you functional?
00:07:40.877,00:07:43.337,I'm dizzy. Did I… did I just A-lock?
00:07:43.421,00:07:44.589,Adjusting your rotation.
00:07:48.384,00:07:49.969,Can you report at this time?
00:07:55.850,00:07:59.437,Where… Who am I talking to?
00:07:59.520,00:08:01.481,"Captain, report what you saw."
00:08:04.150,00:08:06.152,Where were you before you were talking to me?
00:08:07.612,00:08:10.072,-There was an explosion. -Coming from where?
00:08:14.076,00:08:17.788,"Some confusion is perfectly normal at this stage, Captain."
00:08:28.841,00:08:29.842,Who are you?
00:08:30.801,00:08:32.762,"You already have that information, Captain."
00:08:33.346,00:08:35.723,-I do? -Recall my name.
00:08:49.362,00:08:52.240,I… I was on a mission.
00:08:53.491,00:08:57.119,I was flying and… then I woke up on a train.
00:08:58.120,00:09:00.248,And now I'm here.
00:09:00.331,00:09:02.333,I need to be briefed.
00:09:02.416,00:09:04.335,"Um, what… what unit is this?"
00:09:04.418,00:09:05.962,You're with Beleaguered Castle.
00:09:06.045,00:09:07.129,Who?
00:09:07.213,00:09:09.340,Stand by for thread one of alpha memory pattern.
00:09:10.132,00:09:12.510,"Uh, what… what is Beleaguered Castle?"
00:09:12.593,00:09:14.178,The exercises will assist you.
00:09:16.681,00:09:18.432,Memory thread one.
00:09:18.516,00:09:20.184,Listen to the following passage.
00:09:20.851,00:09:24.313,Lilly awoke in an evening dress and opera cloak.
00:09:24.397,00:09:26.566,In her hand were five playing cards.
00:09:26.649,00:09:34.198,"-Is this a joke? -They were, the queen of spades, four of clubs, three of hearts, nine of hearts."
00:09:34.282,00:09:36.867,-Is this a Red Flag exercise? -End of thread one.
00:09:36.951,00:09:40.746,Thread two. The following is a recording of a Western Screech Owl.
00:09:45.084,00:09:47.795,End of thread two. End of pattern. Acknowledge.
00:09:47.878,00:09:50.006,Acknowledge end of pattern.
00:09:50.089,00:09:53.050,Stand by to initiate pattern recall.
00:09:53.134,00:09:54.427,Go for pattern recall.
00:09:54.510,00:09:59.307,"Arrange the five playing cards in order of descending value, irrespective of suit."
00:09:59.390,00:10:02.184,"-Queen, two nines, four and a three. -That is correct."
00:10:02.268,00:10:04.937,The passage I read contained mention of a woman's name.
00:10:05.021,00:10:06.022,What was that name?
00:10:06.105,00:10:07.940,-Her name was Lilly. -That is correct.
00:10:08.733,00:10:09.734,Recall my name.
00:10:12.737,00:10:14.113,Goodwin. Your name's Goodwin.
00:10:14.697,00:10:17.366,"That is correct. Welcome back, Captain."
00:10:31.005,00:10:33.424,"Ma'am, I need… need to talk to my father."
00:10:34.383,00:10:36.677,Has anybody been notified that I'm stateside?
00:10:36.761,00:10:38.095,"Who bombed the train, Captain?"
00:10:38.929,00:10:40.139,What?
00:10:40.222,00:10:41.098,Who bombed the train?
00:10:42.308,00:10:43.809,A woman kept calling me Sean.
00:10:43.893,00:10:45.144,That is incidental.
00:10:45.227,00:10:46.604,"Think, Captain. Remember back."
00:10:47.313,00:10:48.439,Who bombed the train?
00:10:48.522,00:10:50.608,I don't know who bombed the goddamn train.
00:10:51.108,00:10:53.694,-Then go back and try again. -Back where?
00:10:53.778,00:10:55.946,"You will have eight minutes, same as last time."
00:10:56.447,00:10:59.200,"No, no, no, no. No more bullshit sim tests, okay?"
00:10:59.283,00:11:00.660,I need to know where I am.
00:11:00.743,00:11:02.828,What is the location and condition of my crew?
00:11:03.496,00:11:06.123,Does anybody know that I'm stateside?
00:11:06.916,00:11:08.292,You are obligated to give me this information.
00:11:08.376,00:11:09.251,Start with the bomb.
00:11:09.335,00:11:11.045,Where is it? What does it look like?
00:11:11.128,00:11:12.296,-What kind of explosive? -Right.
00:11:12.380,00:11:13.881,-How is it detonated? -Right.
00:11:13.964,00:11:15.925,"Find the bomb, and you will find the bomber."
00:11:16.008,00:11:36.195,"Find the bomb. Wait, no, I… It was good advice. Thank you."
00:11:36.695,00:11:38.197,Okay. That's good.
00:11:38.280,00:11:40.533,And I signed up for an LSAT course.
00:11:41.242,00:11:43.619,"Next thing you know, I'll be moving to India to find myself."
00:11:43.702,00:11:44.787,LSAT.
00:11:51.710,00:11:53.754,She got your shoe.
00:11:54.880,00:11:57.925,"So, what do you think? Am I on the right track?"
00:11:58.008,00:12:00.219,"It's the same train, but it's different."
00:12:01.011,00:12:02.221,Deep.
00:12:02.304,00:12:05.057,I hope it's different. I feel the same way.
00:12:08.519,00:12:09.562,What?
00:12:13.983,00:12:16.944,What is it with guys? Everything's more beautiful in retrospect.
00:12:20.448,00:12:22.283,This looks so real.
00:12:22.366,00:12:26.704,"You know, I think it's gonna be really good for me to get as far away from him as possible."
00:12:29.039,00:12:30.624,May I see your ticket?
00:12:36.714,00:12:37.548,Ha.
00:12:40.009,00:12:42.094,They wouldn't put the doer in front of me.
00:12:42.178,00:12:44.388,-The doer? -You're the pretty girl.
00:12:46.307,00:12:48.142,-Distraction? -Every sim has one.
00:12:51.854,00:12:54.607,"Hey, Grandpa, what the hell was the delay back there?"
00:12:55.524,00:12:57.610,-What are you late for? -What?
00:12:57.693,00:13:00.488,You seem concerned about the time. What are you late for?
00:13:01.071,00:13:03.824,I'm on my way to an asshole festival. I hear you're headlining.
00:13:03.908,00:13:05.951,"Oh, that's funny. What are you, a comedian?"
00:13:06.035,00:13:07.244,Yeah.
00:13:07.328,00:13:08.662,He is a comedian.
00:13:10.080,00:13:10.998,Sit down.
00:13:11.749,00:13:12.750,Freak.
00:13:13.584,00:13:14.960,Fans.
00:13:18.797,00:13:21.800,He came in third on America's Got Talent. Got cited twice for a DUI.
00:13:23.427,00:13:25.012,-Glenbrook Station. -We talked about him.
00:13:25.095,00:13:27.306,"-Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. -You're welcome."
00:13:30.059,00:13:32.353,"Yeah, but by one o'clock the bridge is gonna be jammed."
00:13:44.907,00:13:46.200,"Hey, mister."
00:13:46.283,00:13:47.660,Hey.
00:13:48.494,00:13:50.871,Hey. You dropped this.
00:13:51.455,00:13:52.831,Wow. Thanks.
00:14:10.349,00:14:12.726,Doors are closing.
00:14:30.619,00:14:33.414,The explosion came from behind me.
00:14:37.751,00:14:38.836,What's with you?
00:14:38.919,00:14:40.337,I don't have time to talk to you right now.
00:14:44.800,00:14:46.719,Union Station.
00:15:29.511,00:15:31.680,Holy shit.
00:15:44.276,00:15:45.819,Goodwin?
00:15:45.903,00:15:47.529,You gonna tell me how to disarm this?
00:15:51.408,00:16:08.175,"Uh… Should I… unplug it? Or do you want me to just leave it? Or… Okay, um… I am just gonna leave it."
00:16:11.011,00:16:12.179,Okay?
00:16:21.438,00:16:22.606,I'll be late.
00:16:38.664,00:16:40.708,"Ladies and gentlemen, transit security."
00:16:40.791,00:16:46.255,"-No, you're not. -Due to a classified security breach, I need all of you to turn off any personal electronic devices until we pull into the station, okay?"
00:16:46.338,00:16:49.425,"That means laptops, cell phones. Cell phone, sir? Cell phone, sir."
00:16:49.508,00:16:51.885,"Thank you very much. Pagers, anything electronic."
00:16:51.969,00:16:54.471,Thank you. It's just a precautionary measure. Nothing to worry about.
00:16:54.555,00:16:56.849,So which is it? Security breach or precautionary measure?
00:16:56.932,00:16:58.809,Sir? Sir.
00:17:01.228,00:17:02.312,"Is there a problem here, sir?"
00:17:02.896,00:17:04.815,-I'm in the middle of a very big deal. -Sean?
00:17:04.898,00:17:07.443,-I need you to turn that off. -Why don't you show me that ID again?
00:17:07.526,00:17:08.402,-Sean? -Turn it off.
00:17:08.485,00:17:10.487,"-Turn it off. -What's your problem, asshole?"
00:17:11.405,00:17:13.032,"-Hey. -Oh, my god."
00:17:13.115,00:17:14.867,Sean. What are you doing?
00:17:14.950,00:17:17.077,"Hey, not a good idea, ma'am. Not a good idea."
00:17:17.161,00:17:18.912,Oh. That's not a good idea.
00:17:18.996,00:17:20.706,-I think you broke his jaw. -It's okay.
00:17:20.789,00:17:21.623,He's not any more real than you are.
00:17:21.707,00:17:24.043,I'm not real? How about next time you drive to work?
00:17:24.543,00:17:25.878,Not gonna be a next time.
00:17:44.146,00:17:45.272,Stabilize.
00:17:56.700,00:17:57.618,Did you find the bomb?
00:18:00.287,00:18:01.288,Yes.
00:18:03.791,00:18:05.667,There's hydraulic fluid all over the floor.
00:18:08.712,00:18:10.464,-What is… -Tell me about the bomb.
00:18:13.050,00:18:16.345,Where's that man? I saw a guy with a crutch on the monitor.
00:18:17.554,00:18:19.473,He looks like he's in charge. I want to talk to him.
00:18:19.556,00:18:20.682,"That's irrelevant, Captain."
00:18:20.766,00:18:22.601,I want to talk to your commanding officer!
00:18:22.684,00:18:24.895,You can talk to him upon completion of your mission.
00:18:26.438,00:18:28.899,"My mission is in Afghanistan, where my unit is."
00:18:28.982,00:18:31.276,I flew two goddamn sorties yesterday.
00:18:33.237,00:18:35.447,You've been with us for two months.
00:18:38.117,00:18:40.035,Did you ID the bomber?
00:18:40.702,00:18:43.122,No. Where's my unit?
00:18:44.873,00:18:47.960,And under whose jurisdiction is this simulation?
00:18:48.043,00:18:51.338,"Captain, this is not a simulation. Lives are depending on you."
00:18:52.131,00:18:53.132,What lives?
00:18:54.383,00:18:56.677,What do you remember about the bomb? Tell me about the detonator.
00:18:56.760,00:18:59.138,"No, no, no. What lives? What are you talking about?"
00:19:00.097,00:19:01.557,I need to be briefed.
00:19:11.650,00:19:13.735,"Sir, I… I need to give him something."
00:19:13.819,00:19:15.112,That's fine. Go ahead.
00:19:15.195,00:19:16.405,Okay.
00:19:17.239,00:19:19.074,Get ready to send him back in.
00:19:21.994,00:19:24.621,Justin is… is trying to do all the profiles right now.
00:19:25.789,00:19:33.714,"At 7:48 this morning, Central Standard Time, a bomb exploded on a commuter train outside of Chicago, killing everyone on board."
00:19:33.797,00:19:35.716,And that's the train that you've been on.
00:19:35.799,00:19:38.927,"No, no, no. I'm right here. You're talking to me right now."
00:19:39.011,00:19:41.889,A man named Sean Fentress was on that train.
00:19:42.598,00:19:47.144,"He, for all intents and purposes, is now you."
00:19:48.812,00:19:53.066,Every second spent explaining things puts more innocent civilians at risk.
00:19:53.650,00:19:59.198,-This makes no sense. -The train explosion was the first attack of a series. There are going to be more.
00:19:59.781,00:20:01.783,"Now, did you find the bomb?"
00:20:04.203,00:20:05.287,In the restroom.
00:20:06.205,00:20:07.706,Ventilation panel above the sink.
00:20:10.667,00:20:12.628,Cell phone detonator.
00:20:13.462,00:20:14.588,Are we done?
00:20:15.214,00:20:18.050,"Uh, no, no. But that's good. That's very, very good, Captain."
00:20:19.843,00:20:25.265,"Our records show that 1,812 calls ended at the moment of the explosion."
00:20:25.349,00:20:28.769,Fifty-two of those calls were tethered to the cell tower nearest the train.
00:20:28.852,00:20:31.146,"So, one of those calls was made by our bomber."
00:20:31.230,00:20:34.942,Do you remember a freight train passing by just before the explosion?
00:20:35.025,00:20:42.241,"-Yes. -The explosion was timed to engulf the passing freight train, which means the bomber had to be watching both trains when the call was made."
00:20:42.991,00:20:44.326,Fifty-two callers.
00:20:45.202,00:20:46.662,One of those is our bomber.
00:20:46.745,00:20:50.540,I want you to concentrate on the passengers in your car. Get to know them.
00:20:51.124,00:20:56.421,"Narrow the suspect pool. Look for ones who seem, um… quiet or withdrawn."
00:20:57.381,00:20:59.091,Who seem nervous.
00:21:00.092,00:21:01.802,"As always, you will have eight minutes."
00:21:01.885,00:21:03.971,Eight minutes and then I blow up again?
00:21:05.931,00:21:07.015,Yes.
00:21:10.227,00:21:12.813,I need you to discipline yourself on this next pass.
00:21:12.896,00:21:16.483,Perform only the tasks that we assign you. Everything else is irrelevant.
00:21:17.567,00:21:18.485,Charge the drivers.
00:21:18.568,00:21:31.790,Okay. Has my father even… I took your advice.
00:21:34.209,00:21:35.794,It was very good advice.
00:21:41.675,00:21:42.843,Careful.
00:21:57.190,00:21:58.650,You're very decent.
00:22:03.780,00:22:05.157,Thank you.
00:22:07.326,00:22:08.910,You're real.
00:22:13.749,00:22:16.084,-Anything out of the ordinary? -No.
00:22:19.921,00:22:22.674,Does anything… anybody seem strange to you?
00:22:23.258,00:22:24.301,You're a little strange.
00:22:28.930,00:22:30.640,How about you? Does anybody look suspicious?
00:22:31.475,00:22:32.768,Are you drunk or something?
00:22:33.351,00:22:34.519,Come here.
00:22:36.396,00:22:37.522,Come here for a second.
00:22:39.316,00:22:40.567,Come on.
00:22:48.658,00:22:50.285,Think of it as a game.
00:22:50.368,00:22:51.578,A game?
00:22:53.497,00:22:54.498,Wow.
00:22:56.666,00:22:59.169,"They're all so utterly normal, Sean."
00:22:59.252,00:23:01.088,That's what's so terrifying about them.
00:23:02.339,00:23:04.549,Maybe there's a team at work.
00:23:05.133,00:23:08.804,The sleeping giant in cahoots with the minister and Denoff there.
00:23:10.055,00:23:13.058,Don't forget the sullen college kid. He's the expendable one.
00:23:13.141,00:23:15.727,I bet they're all controlled by the conductor.
00:23:17.354,00:23:21.608,Standing there all dictatorial. Demanding tickets.
00:23:21.691,00:23:23.068,You're funny.
00:23:23.652,00:23:24.778,Damn it.
00:23:24.861,00:23:26.029,What about that guy?
00:23:30.700,00:23:32.536,Hair appointment. Every Monday. You know this.
00:23:32.619,00:23:38.834,"-You talk to these people more than I do. -Right, right. And the guy behind her, he's late for an audition, right?"
00:23:40.752,00:23:44.172,That or a court appearance. That's the guy -that was cited twice for DUI. -For DUI. I know.
00:23:44.256,00:23:46.424,"-Hey, how's the signal in here? -It's good."
00:23:49.219,00:23:51.805,"Is teaching not stimulating enough for you anymore, Sherlock?"
00:23:56.601,00:23:57.644,Uh-oh.
00:23:57.727,00:23:59.980,Now we've slipped into racial profiling land.
00:24:00.063,00:24:02.357,Did anyone else come out of that bathroom today?
00:24:04.526,00:24:05.777,-Me? -Yes.
00:24:08.905,00:24:09.990,Me?
00:24:11.783,00:24:12.951,-Hey. -Hold on.
00:24:13.034,00:24:16.329,Hold on a second. Just hold on a second. There's gotta be something in here.
00:24:19.624,00:24:22.794,A broken phone? What is this?
00:24:28.383,00:24:29.384,Christina?
00:24:29.968,00:24:31.094,Yeah.
00:24:31.761,00:24:33.013,Excuse me.
00:24:39.102,00:24:40.604,"Hey. Hey, come with me."
00:24:40.687,00:24:42.564,"-This isn't our stop. -No, come on. Let's take a walk."
00:24:42.647,00:24:44.524,-We don't get off here. -I know. We'll just be spontaneous.
00:24:44.608,00:24:46.234,You're kind of freaking me out.
00:24:53.450,00:24:59.664,"I know this is gonna sound really weird, but I have a really bad feeling about this train, and I think that we should get off. Okay?"
00:25:16.056,00:25:17.682,"So, what now?"
00:25:17.766,00:25:20.435,"Wait for me, right here. I'll be right back."
00:25:28.318,00:25:32.030,will be leaving in 15 minutes from track two.
00:26:53.903,00:26:55.572,You ready to get that coffee now?
00:26:56.323,00:26:59.326,"Oh. Sorry, yeah. Uh, just… just one more second, okay?"
00:27:11.254,00:27:13.089,"Oh, for God's sake."
00:27:15.759,00:27:16.718,Feeling sick?
00:27:18.595,00:27:21.556,It's motion sickness. I get it all the time.
00:27:24.392,00:27:26.853,-Excuse me. -Excuse me?
00:27:31.858,00:27:33.777,-Are you following me? -Can I borrow your phone?
00:27:35.570,00:27:36.654,No. I don't have one.
00:27:37.238,00:27:38.573,Sure?
00:27:38.656,00:27:39.741,"Yeah, I'm sure."
00:27:39.824,00:27:42.994,"Look, why don't you leave me alone, please. Or I'll call the police."
00:27:43.078,00:27:45.705,With what? I thought you said you didn't have a phone.
00:27:48.958,00:27:50.960,"You know, you have no right."
00:27:53.296,00:27:55.465,What are you doing? Give me my bag back.
00:28:22.909,00:28:24.035,It wasn't you.
00:28:25.912,00:28:27.038,What the hell is wrong with you?
00:28:27.122,00:28:28.331,-No. -Are you insane?
00:28:28.415,00:28:30.750,No. No. No.
00:28:32.585,00:28:33.920,-Get away from me. -Where is it?
00:28:34.003,00:28:34.879,"Get away from me, please."
00:28:43.555,00:28:46.099,-Sean. Sean. -Give me your hand. Get off the track.
00:28:46.182,00:28:48.727,"-Mister, come on. -Sean, Sean, get up."
00:28:48.810,00:28:50.520,Sean. Sean!
00:29:01.239,00:29:02.699,Cold.
00:29:09.414,00:29:10.707,Goodwin?
00:29:12.459,00:29:14.502,"Goodwin, come in. Do you read me?"
00:29:20.675,00:29:22.302,"Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle."
00:29:22.385,00:29:24.179,Do you copy? Please respond.
00:29:27.640,00:29:30.560,It's freezing in here. What's going on?
00:29:36.649,00:29:38.067,What was that?
00:29:41.571,00:29:42.864,He's in trouble.
00:29:44.574,00:29:45.909,I think the oxygen just went out.
00:29:51.039,00:29:52.040,Goodwin?
00:30:02.091,00:30:03.426,Find a way to get through to him.
00:30:28.660,00:30:29.828,What's going on?
00:30:46.094,00:30:48.763,Just keep sending strings out. See if he hooks onto something.
00:30:56.521,00:30:58.356,It's hard to say exactly what he's going through.
00:31:09.826,00:31:11.369,There's not a whole lot we can do from here.
00:31:18.877,00:31:21.379,"If nothing changes, how much time does he have?"
00:31:21.462,00:31:22.463,Some.
00:31:23.923,00:31:25.550,But not a lot.
00:31:57.707,00:32:02.003,"Egyptian, Gulf, Syrian-Lebanese and North African."
00:32:02.086,00:32:05.715,"We will now play you portions of each, discussing their differences."
00:32:19.479,00:32:22.899,Lilly awoke in an evening dress and opera cloak.
00:32:22.982,00:32:25.109,In her hand were five playing cards.
00:32:25.193,00:32:39.290,"They were the queen of spades, the four of clubs… Goodwin, you out there?"
00:32:43.670,00:32:45.505,Goodwin? Where's Goodwin?
00:32:50.760,00:32:52.220,The capsule lost power.
00:32:53.346,00:32:54.639,The capsule?
00:32:54.722,00:32:56.891,"Is that where you are right now, Captain? In a capsule?"
00:32:58.768,00:32:59.852,You should know. Who are you?
00:33:00.436,00:33:02.230,Let me get Captain Goodwin. Get Goodwin.
00:33:02.313,00:33:03.648,"You invented this thing, right?"
00:33:04.232,00:33:06.109,-I did. -Wait. Are you in command here?
00:33:07.026,00:33:10.530,"I am. Were you able to locate the information we need, Captain?"
00:33:11.114,00:33:12.573,"That's a negative, sir."
00:33:12.657,00:33:16.911,"I was unable to find the bomber, but I did save a passenger on the train."
00:33:16.995,00:33:18.496,I got her off safely. A woman.
00:33:18.579,00:33:23.793,"Captain, it's gonna be counterproductive for you to try to save anyone on that train. They are outside the mission."
00:33:26.504,00:33:27.797,"And maybe the rest could, too."
00:33:30.258,00:33:32.844,-None of them can be saved. -What is…what is the source code?
00:33:36.556,00:33:38.641,-it's… it's very complicated. -Try me.
00:33:40.685,00:33:41.894,Fine.
00:33:43.354,00:33:48.026,"When a light bulb is turned off, there's an afterglow, a lingering, halo-like effect. Have you seen it?"
00:33:48.693,00:33:50.278,-Yes. -Of course.
00:33:50.862,00:33:57.410,"The brain is like that. Its electromagnetic field remains charged, just briefly, even after death. Circuits remain open."
00:33:58.244,00:34:00.663,"Now, there's another peculiarity about the brain."
00:34:00.747,00:34:04.000,It contains a short-term memory track that's approximately eight minutes long.
00:34:04.083,00:34:09.964,Like a convenience store security camera that only records the last portion of the day's activity on its hard drive.
00:34:10.590,00:34:21.476,"Now, in combining these two phenomena, circuitry that remains viable post-mortem and a memory bank that goes back eight minutes, source code enables us to capitalize on the overlap."
00:34:22.185,00:34:24.395,Sean Fentress died on that train.
00:34:24.479,00:34:27.523,"Of all the passengers aboard, he was your best link."
00:34:27.607,00:34:33.154,"You two share compatibility in terms of gender, body-size, and your synaptic maps."
00:34:39.869,00:34:44.373,You cannot exist inside the source code beyond Fentress's eight minutes.
00:34:46.084,00:34:49.045,Source code is not time travel.
00:34:50.088,00:34:53.800,"Rather, source code is time reassignment."
00:34:54.383,00:34:57.220,It gives us access to a parallel reality.
00:34:57.804,00:35:04.852,"Now, the deaths on that train were a tragedy, -but source code empowers us… -No, but I… I saved one person."
00:35:04.936,00:35:07.480,That girl that's always sitting across from me.
00:35:07.563,00:35:08.940,I pulled her off the train.
00:35:10.399,00:35:11.400,Give me her name.
00:35:13.402,00:35:16.948,Christina. I… I don't remember her last name.
00:35:23.579,00:35:24.789,Her name was Christina Warren.
00:35:26.249,00:35:27.959,-Yes. -She was 28.
00:35:28.042,00:35:30.336,"-That's her. -Born in Wilmette, Illinois."
00:35:30.419,00:35:31.963,Died this morning on the train.
00:35:33.339,00:35:36.342,No. I pulled her off. She's fine.
00:35:36.425,00:35:37.677,"No, she isn't."
00:35:37.760,00:35:39.345,Believe me. She is.
00:35:39.428,00:35:40.388,Believe me.
00:35:40.471,00:35:42.807,She saw me get hit by the express train.
00:35:42.890,00:35:44.684,"-This isn't getting us anywhere. -No, no, no, wait."
00:35:44.767,00:35:48.896,"Sir, we have to send him in. A second attack is imminent, Dr. Rutledge."
00:35:48.980,00:35:50.106,What second attack?
00:35:50.690,00:35:53.234,"The train was just the beginning, a letter of intent."
00:35:53.317,00:35:56.821,I'm so… What… What aren't you telling me here?
00:35:57.572,00:36:02.910,"We have information that downtown Chicago is the next target, and they're planning to detonate a dirty bomb."
00:36:02.994,00:36:07.957,Do you have any idea how many people would die if an explosion of that magnitude were to occur in the city?
00:36:08.040,00:36:09.458,We're evacuating as we speak.
00:36:10.042,00:36:12.170,We have to stop it before it happens. Do you understand?
00:36:14.922,00:36:17.508,"the real attack, we think, can be prevented."
00:36:18.092,00:36:21.345,"We have very little time left. Out here, the clocks only move in one direction."
00:36:21.929,00:36:23.014,Charge the drivers.
00:36:25.391,00:36:26.684,there's a conductor's compartment.
00:36:26.767,00:36:29.020,It's a small office containing a strongbox.
00:36:29.103,00:36:30.730,Inside is a loaded handgun.
00:36:31.480,00:36:34.692,Get to it. You are authorized to use whatever force necessary.
00:36:40.990,00:36:43.951,It was very good advice.
00:36:49.790,00:36:51.042,You're still here.
00:36:51.542,00:36:52.543,Of course I am.
00:36:53.419,00:36:54.420,Guess what?
00:36:54.503,00:36:56.881,You quit your job and you enrolled in an LSAT course.
00:36:57.590,00:36:58.633,Good guess.
00:36:58.716,00:36:59.800,Soda can.
00:37:02.845,00:37:04.347,Listen to me.
00:37:05.306,00:37:06.265,Don't answer this.
00:37:09.435,00:37:12.230,"Everything looks more beautiful in retrospect, doesn't it?"
00:37:19.779,00:37:25.743,"Do you know me well enough that if I did something that looked a little strange and was maybe even a little bit dangerous, but I told you to trust me anyway that you could do that?"
00:37:27.370,00:37:28.579,No.
00:37:30.915,00:37:32.250,Wow. That was honest.
00:37:34.585,00:37:36.879,You're beautiful. You're kind.
00:37:37.630,00:37:39.090,And you're painfully honest.
00:37:39.674,00:37:41.968,Who are you? And what did you do with Sean Fentress?
00:37:42.051,00:37:43.511,It's the new me.
00:38:11.163,00:38:13.541,"Glenbrook Station, next stop."
00:38:58.169,00:38:59.086,"All right, I don't wanna hurt you."
00:39:09.930,00:39:11.432,He needs medical attention.
00:39:12.016,00:39:15.770,Is it true that you tried to steal a gun out of the train's security box?
00:39:15.853,00:39:17.396,"Careful, ma'am."
00:39:18.647,00:39:21.067,-Damn it. -What were you thinking?
00:39:21.650,00:39:22.693,-Can I borrow your phone? -No.
00:39:22.777,00:39:25.780,"-You need to go to the hospital, Sean. -Please, please, -let me borrow your phone. -No, you need help. No."
00:39:25.863,00:39:26.947,Why do you want my phone?
00:39:32.620,00:39:34.497,What would you do if you only had a minute left to live?
00:39:35.081,00:39:36.123,I don't know.
00:39:39.502,00:39:41.253,I would call my dad.
00:39:42.713,00:39:48.552,I would hear his voice and I'd… and I'd tell him I was sorry.
00:39:56.560,00:39:58.854,Tell me everything's gonna be okay.
00:40:00.147,00:40:01.774,Everything's gonna be okay.
00:40:18.207,00:40:19.041,Thanks for that.
00:40:19.875,00:40:21.001,Did you make any progress?
00:40:21.085,00:40:22.962,Can I get access to a phone?
00:40:23.045,00:40:25.339,I need to talk to my father.
00:40:25.423,00:40:28.759,I will try to work on that soon. Yes. I will try.
00:40:35.015,00:40:36.058,"Goodwin, how am I doing?"
00:40:37.226,00:40:38.853,I'm just trying to measure my performance here.
00:40:38.936,00:40:41.856,Have you ever gone back in? Am I doing better than you did?
00:40:42.440,00:40:45.568,"No, we are wasting valuable time here."
00:40:55.035,00:40:56.704,"No, no."
00:40:56.787,00:40:59.915,I have never been on the other side of a source code mission.
00:40:59.999,00:41:02.918,-I… I wouldn't be a viable candidate. -Why not?
00:41:03.002,00:41:04.545,CAOC-N. What is that?
00:41:04.628,00:41:08.007,Because the specifications are extremely narrow.
00:41:08.507,00:41:10.176,What… what are they?
00:41:10.259,00:41:13.679,"Captain, you should have found a suspect by now."
00:41:13.762,00:41:20.352,"This tactical advantage, this… this tremendous tool that we've given you, don't squander it thinking. Do."
00:41:20.436,00:41:22.646,Please contact my father for me.
00:41:23.772,00:41:26.859,"This will stop at some point, Captain."
00:41:27.610,00:41:30.154,As soon as you finish the mission.
00:41:31.280,00:41:33.574,And you're doing really great.
00:41:33.657,00:41:35.576,And this will end.
00:41:37.119,00:41:40.664,"Now, whoever planted the bomb had to have equipment of some kind."
00:41:40.748,00:41:45.127,"Some gloves, a screwdriver to get into the overhead vent, flashlight, something."
00:41:45.711,00:41:49.131,"Now, check bags and backpacks, briefcases, anything."
00:41:52.092,00:41:54.386,"So, I took your advice."
00:41:54.470,00:42:13.197,"-It was very good advice. -Hey, Grandpa… What are you doing?"
00:42:13.280,00:42:15.574,"I'm just, um, trying to remember something."
00:42:16.325,00:42:18.327,-What is that? -It's a military patch.
00:42:18.410,00:42:20.120,Were you in the military?
00:42:21.705,00:42:23.332,A friend of mine was.
00:42:24.333,00:42:29.004,He was in Afghanistan and he disappeared and no one's heard from him since.
00:42:33.300,00:42:34.802,Do you have the Internet on your phone?
00:42:35.386,00:42:36.762,No.
00:42:36.845,00:42:40.474,It's just connected to the office by a really long piece of string.
00:42:42.893,00:42:45.104,"Do you think you can, uh, see what you could find on this guy?"
00:42:45.187,00:42:47.398,-Sure. -He's just been on my mind a lot lately.
00:42:47.481,00:42:50.150,His name is Captain Colter Stevens. He's in the 17th Airborne.
00:42:50.234,00:42:52.111,Okay. You owe me.
00:42:52.194,00:42:53.737,I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
00:42:56.198,00:42:57.741,Okay. Christina?
00:42:59.493,00:43:03.789,Um… I've been having these dreams lately.
00:43:05.082,00:43:06.500,Really vivid.
00:43:08.544,00:43:09.545,And you've been in them.
00:43:10.588,00:43:12.548,-Really? -What? Oh.
00:43:12.631,00:43:44.455,"No. Not like that. Not that I wouldn't. I… It's just… uh… Um… I'll call you back in a minute, all right? Yeah."
00:43:45.080,00:43:47.374,"-Cramming? -Uh, yeah."
00:43:47.958,00:43:49.043,For what?
00:43:49.126,00:43:53.464,"Uh, psych. And I got a big test this morning, so I should get back to it."
00:43:54.715,00:43:56.133,"Can I, uh, borrow a pen?"
00:43:58.594,00:44:01.555,"Um… Yeah, sure."
00:44:04.266,00:44:06.518,"Whoa. Hey, that's not cool, man."
00:44:07.519,00:44:09.647,"Hey, your bag is a mess."
00:44:09.730,00:44:12.650,"-What are you doing, man? -Never find what I'm looking for."
00:44:12.733,00:44:14.985,It's just like my bag. It's just like my bag.
00:44:15.069,00:44:16.153,How about you let the guy have his bag back?
00:44:16.737,00:44:17.863,Finish your deal.
00:44:17.946,00:44:19.907,"Stay out of this, tough guy. It doesn't end well for you."
00:44:21.367,00:44:22.868,This guy.
00:44:22.951,00:44:24.119,Don't do that.
00:44:24.953,00:44:27.289,Nothing. What am I doing?
00:44:29.625,00:44:31.168,Jesus.
00:44:31.669,00:44:32.920,Dick.
00:44:33.003,00:44:33.879,CAOC-N.
00:44:47.393,00:44:49.103,"Excuse me, ma'am?"
00:44:49.186,00:44:50.646,"Hey, how are you doing? Good morning."
00:44:50.729,00:44:53.774,"-Do you work at Walter Reed? -Yeah, I used to."
00:44:54.691,00:44:57.069,-I'm in the military. -You're in the military?
00:44:57.152,00:45:00.823,"-Yeah. Yeah, I am. I was wondering… -Then what was going on down there?"
00:45:04.243,00:45:09.331,"Oh, you know, uh… We were just having a little bit of an argument actually about… about this patch."
00:45:09.415,00:45:11.834,Is that what they train you to do? Assault civilians?
00:45:11.917,00:45:12.835,"No, ma'am, please."
00:45:12.918,00:45:14.753,"Do any of these letters, they look familiar to you?"
00:45:14.837,00:45:16.088,Do you know what the N stands for?
00:45:17.589,00:45:20.426,It's Air Force and the N stands for Nellis.
00:45:22.845,00:45:24.430,Thank you. Can I borrow your phone?
00:45:25.222,00:45:27.057,"You know what? Actually, I can pay you for it."
00:45:27.141,00:45:36.150,I don't even need to borrow it. I can pay you for it. I have like… Hundred dollars. Just… just -for a couple minutes… -I don't want your money. I… -Just bring it back. -All right. Thank you so much. Thank you.
00:45:47.327,00:45:52.040,"Next stop, Chicago, Union Station."
00:45:52.666,00:45:54.460,"Come on, come on, come on, come on."
00:46:03.844,00:46:11.393,"Um… Name, please?"
00:46:11.477,00:46:13.562,You tell him Captain Colter Stevens is calling.
00:46:16.607,00:46:17.941,Doors are closing.
00:46:23.113,00:46:24.448,I have to tell you something.
00:46:25.574,00:46:27.242,-I know. I found him. -Your friend?
00:46:27.326,00:46:29.620,I got him. Nellis Air Force Base.
00:46:29.703,00:46:33.582,"-Las Vegas. -No, he's not… He's dead, Sean."
00:46:35.417,00:46:36.710,What?
00:46:37.836,00:46:41.089,I'm sorry. Your friend was killed in action two months ago.
00:46:41.715,00:46:43.550,"No, you must've gotten the name wrong."
00:46:43.634,00:46:46.178,Colter Stevens. 17th Airborne helicopter pilot.
00:46:46.261,00:46:47.763,It was on the first site I tried.
00:46:50.599,00:46:52.809,"His father's name is Donald, right?"
00:46:54.144,00:46:55.979,This is from last week.
00:46:56.063,00:47:07.616,"Donald Stevens will join host, Leonard Watt, to discuss the death of his son, Army Captain Colter Stevens, who died in Afghanistan in February, and was honored posthumously with a silver star."
00:47:07.699,00:47:16.124,"Also on the broadcast will be Army Sergeant Robert Alvarez, whose life was saved by Captain Stevens in a fire fight just outside of Kandahar."
00:47:19.294,00:47:20.295,I'm sorry.
00:47:25.551,00:47:27.970,Sean? Talk to me.
00:47:30.973,00:47:33.684,"Captain Stevens, my name is Captain Colleen Goodwin."
00:47:34.184,00:47:37.020,You're with Operation Beleaguered Castle. You're safe.
00:47:40.232,00:47:41.149,"Hey, this guy's crashing."
00:48:08.427,00:48:09.511,Am I dead?
00:48:16.435,00:48:22.774,"A radio listing is saying that I died in a helicopter crash, in country, -and my father received a medal for me. -Your condition's not the issue here."
00:48:22.858,00:48:25.152,You need to focus on preventing any subsequent attack.
00:48:25.235,00:48:26.862,Everything else is irrelevant.
00:48:27.487,00:48:30.115,A news report saying that I'm dead is irrelevant?
00:48:30.198,00:48:34.870,"Until the person or persons who blew up that train are in custody, yes."
00:48:36.580,00:48:42.753,"Goodwin… one soldier to another, am I dead?"
00:48:53.555,00:48:56.475,Part of your brain remains activated.
00:48:58.602,00:49:00.812,What about the rest of me? I can see my hands and my feet.
00:49:00.896,00:49:02.064,They still move.
00:49:02.773,00:49:04.274,They are a manifestation.
00:49:04.358,00:49:06.735,They're… they're just your way of making sense of all this.
00:49:07.569,00:49:11.573,"So, what… what are you saying? Are you saying that I'm imagining this?"
00:49:12.783,00:49:16.828,"I'm imagining that I'm still alive, that I'm in this capsule?"
00:49:54.157,00:49:55.283,"Captain, what just happened?"
00:50:02.124,00:50:02.999,I asked you a question.
00:50:05.419,00:50:08.839,The… the capsule is a… is a manifestation as well.
00:50:09.840,00:50:10.966,Where am I?
00:50:11.758,00:50:12.759,That's classified.
00:50:14.010,00:50:15.178,Fuck you!
00:50:19.057,00:50:22.936,"Captain, I cannot imagine what you must be feeling right now."
00:50:23.562,00:50:27.107,"But if we're to prevent a second attack, we need to send you back immediately."
00:50:27.190,00:50:36.616,"And, Captain, you cannot deviate from the mission while inside the source code, even to investigate your… Even to investigate what happened to you."
00:50:37.200,00:50:40.579,There's only one continuum on this end and it cannot be unsettled.
00:50:40.662,00:50:44.499,"Well, you know what? I did unsettle it. I called you from the train."
00:50:45.667,00:50:54.050,"Just before the explosion, so at 7:46 this morning, that call from the train, but I would never receive it here."
00:50:54.134,00:50:55.510,"It's a different reality, Captain."
00:50:56.094,00:51:00.766,"If the call even went through, it would be received by a different me entirely."
00:51:01.808,00:51:06.938,"This may be difficult for you to hear, but you are a hand on a clock, understand?"
00:51:07.022,00:51:10.066,"We set you, you move forward. We reset you, you move again."
00:51:10.150,00:51:13.403,And that represents the entirety of your function here.
00:51:13.487,00:51:15.572,You know what? Next time I'll send you a pizza.
00:51:15.655,00:51:16.990,I'll see if that makes an impression.
00:51:17.073,00:51:21.912,You cannot alter the continuum of this reality from within the source code.
00:51:22.496,00:51:23.955,"This can't be legal, what you're doing."
00:51:24.039,00:51:30.128,"In fact, your acquisition by this program as well as the program itself has been reviewed and sanctioned by military court."
00:51:31.129,00:51:36.176,You know… many soldiers would find this preferable to death.
00:51:37.052,00:51:40.055,The opportunity to continue serving their country.
00:51:42.349,00:51:45.894,"Have you spent much time in battle, sir? Huh?"
00:51:46.478,00:51:47.813,That's immaterial.
00:51:49.105,00:51:52.400,Any soldier I've ever served with would say that one death is service enough.
00:51:52.984,00:51:56.822,Fine. You can have that in return for completing this mission.
00:51:57.489,00:52:00.158,-Have what? -I'll give you what you want.
00:52:00.242,00:52:03.078,Terminate your service. Let you die.
00:52:06.456,00:52:07.499,This is taking too long.
00:52:07.582,00:52:10.043,You've been too easy on him. No more rest periods.
00:52:13.129,00:52:20.512,I am certain we can find other servicemen with wounds similar to yours who would consider being a part of this program an honor.
00:52:20.595,00:52:23.723,"What? No, no, no. Wait. Wait, what?"
00:52:24.307,00:52:25.767,Send him back.
00:52:26.810,00:52:27.978,Charge the drivers.
00:52:33.233,00:52:40.657,"And Captain Stevens, I'd like you to remember that it's not only about you, but it's also about 2 million real-world Americans."
00:52:40.740,00:52:45.537,"Now, you may not value your own life, I do, however, ask that you value theirs."
00:53:11.646,00:53:14.441,It doesn't matter what you do to them. They're already dead.
00:53:14.524,00:53:16.568,"Get to that gun, and shoot someone if you have to."
00:53:16.651,00:53:18.403,But get us some usable intel.
00:53:33.293,00:53:35.462,We have to keep doing this until you find the bomber.
00:53:35.962,00:53:37.797,Please. I'm trying. I'm trying.
00:53:37.881,00:53:39.132,Who is the bomber?
00:53:41.635,00:53:42.510,I'm trying.
00:53:45.138,00:53:51.853,"I'm sorry, Captain. I know you're exhausted and we're all frustrated, but we cannot fail. You can do this."
00:53:51.937,00:53:54.439,I can't. I can't.
00:53:54.522,00:53:56.024,"Yes, you can."
00:53:56.566,00:53:58.193,"You're a born hero, son."
00:53:58.777,00:54:00.195,Even your father thinks so.
00:54:01.446,00:54:03.239,Saving people is what you do best.
00:54:08.203,00:54:09.955,-I didn't want him to go back. -Dad?
00:54:10.038,00:54:12.707,I just started feeling like he didn't want to come home anymore.
00:54:12.791,00:54:15.043,"-Dad? -Like somehow, he couldn't come home."
00:54:15.919,00:54:18.713,"And he wouldn't talk to me, wouldn't hear me."
00:54:19.756,00:54:24.594,"Finally he said he just couldn't leave his unit out there without him, and that was that."
00:54:30.517,00:54:36.898,"I said some things I shouldn't have. I, uh, I don't know, I never fully understood him."
00:54:37.774,00:54:39.526,And… and I can't believe he's gone.
00:54:45.240,00:54:46.366,Send me back in.
00:55:19.024,00:55:20.567,Please don't blow me up again.
00:55:28.825,00:55:30.076,Oh.
00:55:51.222,00:55:52.265,Hello?
00:55:52.766,00:55:54.392,I know it's you.
00:55:57.645,00:55:59.939,I'm gonna find you. Turn around.
00:56:03.109,00:56:05.153,"-Hey, there. -Me?"
00:56:05.904,00:56:07.280,Why do you look so surprised?
00:56:12.160,00:56:13.161,Don't.
00:56:15.830,00:56:18.166,Move. I said move. Move. Put your bag over there.
00:56:18.249,00:56:19.250,-Okay. -Move over.
00:56:19.334,00:56:20.794,"-Put the bag over there and move over. -Okay, okay."
00:56:20.877,00:56:24.047,Move over. Move over. Now hand me your phone.
00:56:25.298,00:56:27.300,-You're done. You're done. -What?
00:56:27.383,00:56:28.885,You can't kill anybody anymore.
00:56:28.968,00:56:30.345,What? I don't understand.
00:56:30.428,00:56:32.055,You were going to trigger the bomb with your phone.
00:56:32.138,00:56:36.518,"What? Dude, I swear I don't know what you're talking about."
00:56:37.227,00:56:41.648,"Listen, my name's George Troxel. I'm a software engineer, okay?"
00:56:41.731,00:56:43.608,-Right. -I was talking to my wife.
00:56:45.151,00:56:46.778,Try it again.
00:56:47.362,00:56:49.531,Your call. Dial it again.
00:56:50.865,00:56:53.201,Okay. I'm gonna press redial.
00:56:53.827,00:56:56.746,"Your phone is gonna ring, and then I'm gonna shoot you."
00:57:00.500,00:57:03.294,Shit. I'm sorry. Sorry.
00:57:08.925,00:57:10.552,You dropped this.
00:57:11.136,00:57:12.637,Wow. Thanks.
00:57:48.381,00:57:50.133,Shit. No. No.
00:57:54.971,00:57:56.264,Wait.
00:57:59.309,00:58:00.894,No. Come on.
00:58:15.366,00:58:16.576,Stop the train.
00:58:40.934,00:58:42.018,Hey.
00:58:45.563,00:58:46.689,Hey.
00:58:56.324,00:58:58.034,-Derek Frost. -Yes?
00:58:58.826,00:59:00.495,-See this? -Yes.
00:59:00.578,00:59:02.705,-You recognize it? -No.
00:59:05.667,00:59:07.043,Jesus.
00:59:09.295,00:59:11.005,How about you give me your wallet?
00:59:11.673,00:59:12.840,Okay.
00:59:14.133,00:59:15.468,Oh.
00:59:15.552,00:59:17.679,You left it on the train deliberately.
00:59:18.513,00:59:21.558,I… must have dropped it.
00:59:21.641,00:59:23.017,No.
00:59:23.601,00:59:26.437,"You planted it there, so everybody would think you were dead."
00:59:31.317,00:59:32.569,I know it's you.
00:59:34.028,00:59:35.697,How do you know so much?
00:59:42.412,00:59:44.622,What the hell is that thing?
00:59:45.832,00:59:48.167,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. Slow down."
00:59:50.211,00:59:52.046,Do you wanna see it?
00:59:52.714,00:59:53.923,Very patriotic.
00:59:55.133,00:59:56.384,"Slowly, slowly."
01:00:02.807,01:00:05.059,"All right, all right. Back up. Back up. Back up."
01:00:12.650,01:00:16.154,Not many people could build that.
01:00:23.036,01:00:25.622,All right. Where is your next target?
01:00:25.705,01:00:27.332,Sean?
01:00:30.627,01:00:31.961,"Oh, my God."
01:01:03.326,01:01:04.911,Sean Fentress?
01:01:06.621,01:01:08.122,Teacher.
01:01:08.998,01:01:10.291,History.
01:01:19.258,01:01:20.301,Why?
01:01:21.552,01:01:23.137,You messed up my timing.
01:01:23.888,01:01:25.848,-Why? -Oh.
01:01:26.641,01:01:28.434,You mean… you mean Why this?
01:01:30.937,01:01:35.191,Because the world is hell.
01:01:36.609,01:01:39.028,But we have a chance to start over in the rubble.
01:01:39.779,01:01:41.572,But first there has to be rubble.
01:01:42.782,01:01:45.451,"You're a teacher, you… you understand."
01:02:14.605,01:02:15.982,Christina.
01:02:18.359,01:02:20.862,Stay with me. Stay with me.
01:02:26.159,01:02:28.286,Everything's gonna be okay.
01:02:35.209,01:02:36.627,This isn't the end.
01:02:39.380,01:02:41.132,Check through there. I'll go check this way.
01:03:36.395,01:03:39.106,"Captain, this is Beleaguered Castle. Acknowledge transmission."
01:03:47.281,01:03:49.283,"Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle."
01:03:49.367,01:03:50.701,Acknowledge transmission.
01:03:51.911,01:03:54.247,I have your bomber. I have his name.
01:03:59.585,01:04:01.254,You have the bomber's name?
01:04:01.337,01:04:02.421,Derek Frost.
01:04:07.468,01:04:11.931,He got into a rented white van in the Glenbrook Station parking lot.
01:04:12.014,01:04:16.102,"Illinois plates, five, Charlie, Golf, Yankee, eight, four, seven."
01:04:16.185,01:04:19.313,"Illinois plates, 5CGY847."
01:04:20.147,01:04:21.566,"All right, let's move."
01:04:22.567,01:04:25.194,"And Goodwin… and Goodwin, there is a radioactive device in the van."
01:04:25.278,01:04:28.364,"-Some kind of bomb. -Thank you, Captain."
01:04:28.447,01:04:29.532,"Yes, ma'am."
01:04:30.324,01:04:33.202,"Thank you, Captain. You are now off the clock."
01:04:33.828,01:04:35.496,About our deal?
01:04:35.580,01:04:40.001,I had hoped that you might reconsider that for the sake of the program.
01:04:40.668,01:04:42.420,I have. I want something else now.
01:04:43.170,01:04:44.505,Good.
01:04:46.173,01:04:48.259,I still wanna die.
01:04:48.342,01:04:52.054,But I want to go back in and I wanna save all those people on that train first.
01:04:52.138,01:04:54.473,It doesn't work that way. It can't.
01:04:54.557,01:04:56.183,"No, I know. I know, I know."
01:04:57.184,01:05:04.025,"I'm not really asking you to believe me, sir. I'm just… I'm asking you to have the decency to let me try."
01:05:09.614,01:05:12.783,Van is approaching fence gate to the quarry. Over.
01:05:14.368,01:05:16.078,Allow the vehicle to enter the quarry road.
01:05:16.162,01:05:18.873,We'll stop him about halfway down. Over.
01:05:19.874,01:05:24.045,"AU SWAT-2, this is CPD-2. Block the east end of the road. Over."
01:05:28.382,01:05:29.967,from our Chicago affiliate.
01:05:32.678,01:05:35.056,The Illinois man has been sought since early this morning.
01:05:35.139,01:05:37.934,The door is… the door is open and the man is on the ground.
01:05:38.017,01:05:39.602,It appears he has surrendered.
01:05:45.232,01:05:49.362,"In recent months, Frost started posting anti-government statements on his website."
01:05:49.445,01:05:52.490,"Yes, sir, it's a real validation of the program."
01:05:52.573,01:05:56.285,A clear window into just how revolutionary source code can be.
01:05:56.369,01:05:59.914,We finally have a powerful weapon now in the war on terror.
01:06:00.623,01:06:03.292,"Congratulations, Captain. A job well done."
01:06:05.544,01:06:07.755,"He's not gonna send me back in, is he, Goodwin?"
01:06:15.846,01:06:17.139,"Are you married, Captain?"
01:06:17.723,01:06:21.185,Um… Joe?
01:06:21.686,01:06:22.603,Why don't you go take a break?
01:06:22.687,01:06:25.606,-You deserve to celebrate. -Sure.
01:06:25.690,01:06:26.857,"Uh, can I get you something?"
01:06:26.941,01:06:27.942,"No, I'm fine."
01:06:32.238,01:06:34.407,Why? Are you asking me on a date?
01:06:34.490,01:06:36.033,Sorry. Poor taste.
01:06:36.617,01:06:38.285,-Are you married? -Hmm?
01:06:39.120,01:06:40.162,No.
01:06:40.997,01:06:42.498,I am divorced.
01:06:43.791,01:06:47.211,Do you think there's an alternate version of you?
01:06:47.878,01:06:49.588,A Goodwin who made different choices?
01:06:50.756,01:06:52.425,What do you mean?
01:06:53.009,01:06:56.387,"Like, uh, you who didn't get married and get divorced."
01:06:56.470,01:06:58.723,Or just married someone else.
01:06:59.932,01:07:03.019,A woman who just took a different fork in the road.
01:07:05.271,01:07:07.148,"No, I don't, Captain."
01:07:08.482,01:07:11.235,What you experienced was a shadow.
01:07:11.318,01:07:14.321,It was an afterimage of a victim on a train.
01:07:15.281,01:07:17.783,This is real life. Here.
01:07:18.868,01:07:21.162,The one where you're talking to a dead helicopter pilot?
01:07:26.917,01:07:29.253,The program wasn't designed to alter the past.
01:07:29.336,01:07:32.923,It was designed to affect the future. And you've done that.
01:07:33.007,01:07:35.134,"I missed something, Captain."
01:07:35.634,01:07:37.511,That train shouldn't have blown up.
01:07:37.595,01:07:40.723,"There must have been a second detonator, something I couldn't see. A fail-safe."
01:07:42.767,01:07:45.186,"It's a computer program, Captain."
01:07:45.811,01:07:49.482,"The… the girl on the train, all the others, they're lost."
01:07:50.524,01:07:51.942,I'm sorry about that.
01:07:52.026,01:07:53.736,I get it. I get it.
01:07:53.819,01:07:56.822,"I know. Quantum physics, parabolic calculus."
01:07:57.490,01:07:59.366,"You're wrong, Goodwin."
01:07:59.992,01:08:01.327,You're just plain wrong.
01:08:01.410,01:08:03.287,"Captain, Christina is dead."
01:08:04.789,01:08:06.665,"She doesn't have to be, ma'am."
01:08:08.584,01:08:10.753,Okay. I'll ask Rutledge.
01:08:10.836,01:08:12.671,I'm asking you.
01:08:14.131,01:09:18.612,I'm asking you. Just… Send me… It's your choice.
01:09:21.365,01:09:24.493,"At the end of this source code, I will terminate your life support."
01:09:31.500,01:09:33.794,There will be no coming back.
01:09:37.798,01:09:39.925,"I'm gonna save her, Goodwin."
01:09:41.844,01:09:44.138,"It was an honor, Captain."
01:09:45.848,01:09:48.767,And I thank you for your service.
01:09:50.269,01:09:51.645,Good luck.
01:10:07.203,01:10:08.829,I took your advice.
01:10:10.831,01:10:13.209,"You're gonna move to India, and become a guru."
01:10:15.377,01:10:18.130,"Yeah, I'm gonna go find myself in the mountains."
01:10:20.299,01:10:23.135,"Well, maybe you'll have a cup of coffee with me before you go."
01:10:23.969,01:10:26.931,Yeah. I'd like to do that. Put it to the test.
01:10:27.556,01:10:28.766,Good.
01:10:29.516,01:10:31.101,Let's do it today.
01:10:31.185,01:10:34.647,Let's just skip work. Bryan can find someone else to assist him.
01:10:39.568,01:10:41.487,-You know what? -What?
01:10:42.321,01:10:44.073,I feel really good.
01:10:44.865,01:10:45.991,Why?
01:10:47.201,01:10:51.205,Because I've been waiting for weeks for you to ask me for coffee.
01:11:00.589,01:11:01.757,Okay.
01:11:02.967,01:11:05.469,"Just give me a couple minutes, okay? And I'll be right back."
01:11:05.552,01:11:07.554,Gotta go save the world.
01:11:10.724,01:11:12.643,I knew he was a keeper.
01:11:49.763,01:11:51.181,Beautiful day.
01:11:55.227,01:11:56.353,Ticket?
01:11:56.437,01:11:57.855,"Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry."
01:12:05.195,01:12:06.530,"Yeah, well, sure."
01:12:06.613,01:12:15.289,"Look, if we can get the funding, I guarantee we can have at least… Eight source code projects up and running by the end of the year."
01:12:17.958,01:12:19.460,"You're a real hero, Dr. Rutledge."
01:12:20.044,01:12:21.295,"Well, thank you."
01:12:22.087,01:12:24.173,"Oh, we did save lives today."
01:12:24.256,01:12:25.883,"Yes, a true victory for the program."
01:12:26.383,01:12:27.593,A great victory for us all.
01:12:27.676,01:12:29.345,We'll talk soon.
01:12:30.804,01:12:33.015,So? Exciting times.
01:12:34.141,01:12:39.021,"Let's initialize the memory wipe on SC-1, start crunching the data."
01:12:39.688,01:12:46.612,Sir… we… we… we told Captain Stevens that we were gonna let him die.
01:12:47.654,01:12:49.531,Let him die?
01:12:49.615,01:12:51.408,He just saved millions of lives today.
01:12:51.992,01:12:54.244,How many other disasters might he avert down the line?
01:12:54.328,01:12:59.666,"For all we know, he may be the only candidate with which the system works."
01:13:00.584,01:13:06.507,So… let's clear his memory and reinitialize source code.
01:13:07.091,01:13:08.384,Shall we?
01:13:13.472,01:13:14.807,"Yes, sir."
01:13:19.561,01:13:24.400,"Sorry, I just dropped… Hey, Derek. This isn't your stop."
01:13:26.527,01:13:28.195,You dropped this.
01:13:31.740,01:13:33.575,Union Station.
01:13:33.659,01:13:34.618,Oops.
01:14:05.357,01:14:09.361,"Derek, it's over."
01:14:11.405,01:14:12.865,You understand?
01:14:17.161,01:14:19.496,Hey. My name is Derek Frost.
01:14:19.580,01:14:24.585,I planted a nuclear device in a white van parked in the Glenbrook Station CCR parking lot.
01:14:25.335,01:14:30.757,Right now I'm handcuffed to a pole on the 944 CCR train headed to Chicago Union Station.
01:14:31.383,01:14:34.136,I am a sick and pathetic human being.
01:14:34.219,01:14:36.889,And I need to be locked away for a very long time.
01:14:40.434,01:14:41.602,Okay.
01:14:43.353,01:14:47.983,Derek… there's no more burying the world in rubble today.
01:14:51.945,01:14:54.072,You mind if I borrow this?
01:14:57.159,01:15:00.287,"Captain, some of the guys and I are gonna go celebrate."
01:15:00.954,01:15:05.792,"And, uh… Do you want me to initiate the memory wipe, Captain?"
01:15:37.533,01:15:38.617,"Hello, Captain."
01:15:51.255,01:15:52.256,Yes?
01:15:57.010,01:15:59.805,"My name is, uh, Sean Fentress."
01:16:12.943,01:16:15.571,I'm sorry it's taken me so long to call you.
01:16:17.239,01:16:21.368,Sometimes it just takes a while to figure out what you want to say. You know?
01:16:22.744,01:16:27.332,Nah. Don't be too hard on yourself. I imagine it's not an easy call to make.
01:16:33.505,01:16:34.840,"How are you doing, sir?"
01:16:36.925,01:16:40.887,"Well, um… all that came back was some ash."
01:16:42.556,01:16:44.516,It's hard to believe that it was him.
01:16:53.900,01:16:55.527,How well did you know him?
01:16:56.737,01:17:03.744,"Oh, um… I was there when he died, sir."
01:17:04.536,01:17:22.512,"He said… that the last time that you guys talked um, was tough… and, uh… he wanted to say that he was sorry."
01:17:25.265,01:17:26.808,I just want him back.
01:18:00.884,01:18:03.387,I wish I could have told him that.
01:18:06.139,01:18:07.641,He knows it.
01:18:10.977,01:18:13.105,"You take care, Mr. Stevens."
01:18:41.675,01:18:42.759,You okay?
01:18:44.845,01:18:45.721,Yeah.
01:18:46.722,01:18:47.764,Save the world?
01:18:49.307,01:18:50.308,Sort of.
01:18:50.934,01:18:53.729,"So, where were we?"
01:18:55.188,01:18:57.149,Getting some coffee.
01:18:58.942,01:19:00.444,Dr. Rutledge.
01:19:02.696,01:19:03.697,What?
01:19:13.874,01:19:15.041,Shit.
01:19:18.670,01:19:20.172,Everything moves on time or people get fired.
01:19:20.255,01:19:21.631,That's the way it works in the real world.
01:19:24.634,01:19:27.179,Don't sweat the small stuff. You'll drown.
01:19:27.262,01:19:30.307,"Thank you for that moment of Zen, but nobody was talking to you."
01:19:30.390,01:19:34.269,"What, are you selling self-help CDs today? Why don't you just mind your own business."
01:19:34.352,01:19:38.732,Security? Get me a detachment of MPs here this instant.
01:19:40.066,01:19:42.194,"Why are you always so bitter, Max?"
01:19:42.778,01:19:46.239,"It's a bitter world we live in, my friend. What do you want from me?"
01:19:46.323,01:19:49.451,"Uh, it doesn't have to be."
01:19:51.203,01:19:55.540,I will bet you $100 you can't make all these people on this train laugh.
01:20:01.505,01:20:05.717,"Actually, you know what? 126 bucks."
01:20:05.801,01:20:08.053,Is that your way of making fun of me?
01:20:08.136,01:20:09.554,I guess you have a better gig.
01:20:09.638,01:20:11.306,"-Never mind. -No, no. I'm good."
01:20:12.599,01:20:14.059,Easiest money ever.
01:20:17.145,01:20:24.945,One of our fellow passengers has decided to offer me some money to… What has gotten into you today? You're like a different person.
01:20:25.028,01:20:27.322,-It's the new me. -I like it.
01:20:28.698,01:20:35.664,I am going to prosecute you Women always mess up my last name.
01:20:35.747,01:20:38.041,I was with a girl the other night and she kept calling me Getoff.
01:20:38.124,01:20:40.627,"She was like, Getoff. Getoff. I'm like, No, Denoff, Denoff."
01:20:40.710,01:20:42.587,"She says, No, you're fat and you're heavy. Get off."
01:20:45.423,01:20:46.842,Good?
01:20:46.925,01:20:48.510,Twenty seconds.
01:20:48.593,01:20:50.011,Make it ten.
01:20:52.097,01:20:53.098,Goodwin?
01:21:00.480,01:21:02.190,-What? -Michelle. Barack.
01:21:04.484,01:21:06.152,All this life.
01:21:12.409,01:21:15.787,Goodwin. Open this door.
01:21:28.341,01:21:36.600,-Why do you keep looking at your watch? -Christina… what would you do… if you knew you had less than a minute to live?
01:21:43.148,01:21:45.358,I'd make those seconds count.
01:21:47.152,01:21:48.528,I'd kiss you again.
01:21:49.195,01:21:50.655,Again? Mmm.
01:21:51.907,01:21:54.242,"Goodwin, open this goddamn door!"
01:21:55.660,01:21:57.203,"He's done enough, Doctor."
01:23:20.078,01:23:21.663,Everything's gonna be okay.
01:23:37.303,01:23:39.431,Temperatures expected to reach the lower 60s.
01:23:39.514,01:23:44.185,"Right now 55 at the lakefront, 54 at Midway, 53 at O'Hare."
01:23:47.981,01:23:49.357,"Well, he earned that money."
01:23:50.066,01:23:51.234,"-Yeah, he did. -He was funny."
01:23:51.317,01:23:52.861,"Speaking of which, I have no cash."
01:23:58.116,01:24:00.201,"-Such a beautiful day, isn't it? -Yeah."
01:24:00.285,01:24:02.787,It is a really perfect day.
01:24:14.841,01:24:16.468,Do you believe in fate?
01:24:17.302,01:24:20.305,Not really. I'm more of a dumb luck kind of gal.
01:24:21.306,01:24:23.058,-Come here. -Wow.
01:24:43.411,01:24:45.371,I think we should stay here for a while.
01:24:47.207,01:24:50.210,"This feels like exactly where we're supposed to be, doesn't it?"
01:24:59.260,01:25:01.971,It's 72 degrees on a cloudy Monday morning.
01:25:06.392,01:25:08.728,"-Good morning, Joe. -Good morning, Captain."
01:25:16.319,01:25:18.571,In her hand were five playing cards.
01:25:21.825,01:25:27.747,"At some point today, you're gonna hear about a failed terrorist attack on a commuter train near Chicago."
01:25:28.623,01:25:30.625,You and I kept that bomb from going off.
01:25:35.171,01:25:42.762,"But it was thwarted, and the suspect was found on board, -named Derek Frost. -Derek Frost."
01:25:48.143,01:25:51.146,"Captain Goodwin, anything I can help you with?"
01:25:54.274,01:25:56.776,"No, that's fine. I'll come back later."
01:26:01.489,01:26:02.657,Keep an eye out.
01:26:04.659,01:26:14.794,One of these days the right crisis is going to rear its head and source code is going to have its moment in the sun.
01:26:14.878,01:26:16.212,"Yes, sir."
01:26:25.638,01:26:29.017,then source code works even better than you and Dr. Rutledge imagined.
01:26:29.934,01:26:33.771,"You thought you were creating eight minutes of a past event, but you're not."
01:26:34.439,01:26:37.442,You've created a whole new world.
01:26:38.484,01:26:45.617,"Goodwin, if I'm right, somewhere at the source code facility you have a Captain Colter Stevens waiting to send on a mission."
01:26:46.492,01:26:50.496,"Promise me you'll help him. And when you do, do me a favor."
01:26:51.414,01:26:53.750,Tell him everything is gonna be okay.
