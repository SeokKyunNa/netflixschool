00:00:27.653,00:00:31.782,I'll be back in 20 minutes.
00:00:31.824,00:00:34.409,It's tulip season today.
00:00:34.451,00:00:37.621,"And I'm, oh, so happy."
00:00:39.957,00:00:42.584,Son of a bitch.
00:00:44.211,00:00:47.214,"Come on, sweetie."
00:00:47.255,00:00:49.550,Excuse me.
00:00:51.343,00:00:55.222,"Yes, come on."
00:00:55.263,00:00:57.641,"Come on, sweetie."
00:00:57.683,00:01:03.355,"Let's go for a little ride, then you can whiz all over the city."
00:01:03.397,00:01:07.609,"Come on, go for a ride."
00:01:07.651,00:01:10.946,No! Freeze! Freeze!
00:01:10.988,00:01:13.281,Leg down! Leg down!
00:01:13.323,00:01:17.494,That's it. That's it.
00:01:17.536,00:01:20.664,"Come on. Come on, now."
00:01:20.706,00:01:23.834,No! You monkey-eared son of a...
00:01:23.876,00:01:28.756,You have pissed your last floor.
00:01:28.797,00:01:32.175,I'll bet you wish you were a real...
00:01:33.886,00:01:38.724,"Oh, you..."
00:01:38.766,00:01:42.644,This is New York.
00:01:42.686,00:01:44.855,"You relentless, smelly, little..."
00:01:52.780,00:01:55.074,SIMON: Verdell?
00:01:55.198,00:01:58.201,Verdell? Verdell?
00:01:59.536,00:02:03.749,Where's my good doggie?
00:02:03.791,00:02:07.461,"Come here, sweetheart."
00:02:07.502,00:02:09.922,Mr. Udall?
00:02:12.215,00:02:16.637,Have you seen Verdell?
00:02:18.764,00:02:23.310,"Uh, my dog. You know, my..."
00:02:23.351,00:02:26.021,My dog with the little face.
00:02:26.063,00:02:29.608,Don't you know what it looks like?
00:02:29.650,00:02:32.402,"Oh, I got it. You were talking about your dog."
00:02:32.444,00:02:37.825,I thought it was the name of that colored man I've been seeing in the halls.
00:02:37.866,00:02:39.660,Which color was that?
00:02:39.701,00:02:44.039,"Uh, like thick molasses with a broad nose."
00:02:44.081,00:02:45.707,Perfect for smelling-- Frank!
00:02:45.749,00:02:47.668,FRANK: Just a second.
00:02:47.709,00:02:49.711,Frank.
00:02:49.753,00:02:51.463,"Simon, you have got to get dressed."
00:02:51.505,00:02:54.382,Frank Sachs. Melvin Udall.
00:02:54.424,00:02:59.429,"Frank shows my work, Mr. Udall. I think-- I think you know that."
00:02:59.471,00:03:00.722,Please.
00:02:59.471,00:03:03.851,"What I know is, as long as you keep your work zipped up..."
00:03:03.892,00:03:06.979,I don't give a rat crap what or where you shove your show.
00:03:07.021,00:03:10.315,Are we done being neighbors for now?
00:03:14.862,00:03:17.072,Let me talk to you-- No! No! No! Not worth it.
00:03:17.114,00:03:21.660,Definitely not worth it.
00:03:21.702,00:03:22.911,Okay.
00:03:24.496,00:03:28.000,Hope you find him.
00:03:28.042,00:03:32.379,"You don't love anything, Mr. Udall."
00:03:47.477,00:03:50.313,Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.
00:03:51.523,00:03:56.070,"One, two, three, four, five."
00:03:56.111,00:04:00.074,"One, two, three, four, five."
00:04:00.115,00:04:03.118,"One, two, three, four, five."
00:04:03.160,00:04:05.328,Okay.
00:04:23.764,00:04:27.142,Hot.
00:04:44.785,00:04:46.703,"Hi, Carl."
00:04:46.745,00:04:48.371,So where is he?
00:04:48.413,00:04:50.624,Take it easy. He just had a thing with the dog.
00:04:50.665,00:04:52.626,"First, it's not just a hot-looking dog."
00:04:52.667,00:04:54.502,He's adorable.
00:04:54.544,00:04:59.007,Where you going? He's not the only one who's working.
00:04:59.049,00:05:02.844,My honey. Where have you been?
00:05:02.886,00:05:07.390,"Oh, look at my boy."
00:05:11.270,00:05:15.523,"Yeah, I found him, Mr. Bishop."
00:05:15.565,00:05:18.152,Where was my little baby?
00:05:18.193,00:05:22.530,In the basement garbage bin eating diaper shit.
00:05:25.951,00:05:27.995,"Go ahead, John."
00:05:28.036,00:05:31.165,"Sorry, it just struck me as funny."
00:05:31.206,00:05:33.041,"SIMON: Oh, uh, wait."
00:05:33.083,00:05:36.837,How did he get down in the basement?
00:05:36.878,00:05:39.798,"I mean, even if he got in the elevator..."
00:05:39.840,00:05:44.427,Maybe some nice neighbor shoved him down the garbage chute.
00:05:46.721,00:05:52.727,"MELVIN: Somewhere in the dark, she had confessed and he had forgiven."
00:05:52.769,00:05:55.856,"This is what you live for, he said."
00:05:55.897,00:05:59.776,Two heads on a pillow where all is approval.
00:05:59.818,00:06:04.698,And there is only the safety of being with each other.
00:06:04.739,00:06:08.827,"How, she wondered, could she find such hope in the most shameful part of her?"
00:06:10.662,00:06:13.248,SIMON: Mr. Udall!
00:06:10.662,00:06:16.459,"At last, she was able to define love."
00:06:16.459,00:06:18.962,Love was...
00:06:19.004,00:06:24.634,"Mr. Udall, I'd like to speak to you, please."
00:06:24.676,00:06:26.469,Love was...
00:06:26.469,00:06:27.804,SIMON: Are you in there?
00:06:27.846,00:06:30.224,Son of a bitch!
00:06:30.265,00:06:32.642,Pansy-assed stool-pusher!
00:06:32.684,00:06:35.478,Yes?
00:06:35.478,00:06:37.814,Maybe this can wait.
00:06:37.856,00:06:42.485,"I... I found Verdell, Mr. Udall."
00:06:46.865,00:06:51.286,"Well, that's a load off."
00:06:51.328,00:06:55.498,Uh-huh. Did you-- Did you do something to him?
00:06:55.540,00:07:01.504,Do you realize I work at home?
00:07:01.546,00:07:06.676,Do you like being interrupted when playing in your garden?
00:07:09.137,00:07:13.183,"No, I... I actually will turn the ringer off on my phone."
00:07:13.225,00:07:17.812,And sometimes I put a piece of cardboard-- I work all the time.
00:07:17.854,00:07:22.525,"So never, never interrupt me. Okay?"
00:07:22.525,00:07:27.030,Not if there's a fire.
00:07:22.525,00:07:37.582,"Not even if you hear the sound of a thud from my home, one week later there's a smell coming from there that can only be a decaying human body and you have to hold a hanky to your face because the stench is so thick you think you're gonna faint."
00:07:37.624,00:07:41.295,"Even then, don't come knocking."
00:07:41.336,00:07:53.056,Or if it's election night and you're excited and you wanna celebrate because some fudge-packer that you date has been elected the first queer president of the United States.
00:07:53.098,00:07:58.103,And he's going to have you down to Camp David...
00:07:58.145,00:08:02.357,and you want someone to share the moment with.
00:08:02.399,00:08:08.071,"Even then, don't knock."
00:08:08.113,00:08:11.658,Not for any reason.
00:08:11.699,00:08:16.788,"Do you get me, sweetheart?"
00:08:16.830,00:08:23.003,Yes. It's not a subtle point that you're making.
00:08:23.044,00:08:26.006,"Okay, then."
00:08:38.810,00:08:43.106,So the theory of confrontations is now he'll think twice before messing with me.
00:08:48.653,00:08:50.613,All right.
00:08:52.615,00:08:54.117,Love was...
00:08:58.246,00:09:01.416,What was love?
00:09:01.458,00:09:04.127,Love was...
00:09:08.631,00:09:13.345,"Oh, now I'm pissed."
00:09:13.387,00:09:15.180,Don't touch!
00:09:15.222,00:09:16.931,Don't touch!
00:09:16.973,00:09:21.936,"Shut up! You think you can intimidate the world, but you don't intimidate me."
00:09:21.978,00:09:25.940,I grew up in hell.
00:09:25.982,00:09:29.444,Police!
00:09:29.486,00:09:33.656,Help me! Help me! Help me!
00:09:33.656,00:09:37.244,Shh!
00:09:37.285,00:09:46.669,I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch that dog again.
00:09:49.548,00:09:55.470,"Meantime, I'm gonna think of some way you can make it up to him."
00:09:55.512,00:10:00.892,I hate doing this!
00:10:00.934,00:10:03.144,Have a nice day.
00:10:03.186,00:10:06.606,"Okay, party!"
00:10:24.791,00:10:27.627,Excuse me.
00:10:27.668,00:10:29.337,Don't touch.
00:10:31.089,00:10:32.632,MAN: Watch it.
00:10:32.673,00:10:33.883,MAN: Hey.
00:10:41.433,00:10:44.144,"Look at you. All better, huh?"
00:10:44.185,00:10:45.895,You know all my son's stuff?
00:10:45.937,00:10:48.106,"No, no, no."
00:10:48.148,00:10:52.944,"I'm walking out the door, he says, Mom, I promise not to get one of my fevers during your date."
00:10:52.986,00:10:56.406,"Oh, isn't that sweet?"
00:10:56.448,00:10:58.199,Eat everything.
00:10:58.241,00:11:03.538,"I said, You love me the way you love your remote control as long as I switch every time you press my buttons."
00:11:03.580,00:11:05.624,That's great. That's terrific.
00:11:05.748,00:11:10.795,People that talk in metaphors ought to shampoo my crotch.
00:11:10.837,00:11:12.755,Eat up!
00:11:12.755,00:11:14.257,I've got your money.
00:11:14.299,00:11:16.468,Pay me next week.
00:11:16.510,00:11:18.470,I told you today.
00:11:18.512,00:11:19.804,"Excuse me, Melvin."
00:11:18.512,00:11:21.473,"Uh-- Oop, excuse me."
00:11:23.600,00:11:26.811,There you go. You take care.
00:11:29.606,00:11:32.275,Pardon me.
00:11:32.317,00:11:34.528,Take the money.
00:11:34.569,00:11:37.780,This way you take a cab home so you have time to get ready.
00:11:37.780,00:11:40.033,Ready is not my problem.
00:11:40.074,00:11:43.870,I'm starving.
00:11:43.911,00:11:45.913,You know you're not allowed back here.
00:11:45.955,00:11:47.957,Spence is more excited about it than I am.
00:11:47.999,00:11:51.836,"He says, I promise not to get-- Mm-mm. No, no."
00:11:51.878,00:11:55.798,"Sometimes, these kids, you just wanna..."
00:11:55.798,00:11:58.385,I've got Jews at my table.
00:11:58.426,00:12:00.845,It's not your table.
00:12:00.887,00:12:03.181,Behave. You can sit at someone else's station.
00:12:04.891,00:12:06.851,Or you can wait your turn.
00:12:10.938,00:12:14.401,I'm glad you let him go.
00:12:14.442,00:12:16.194,"Well, yes."
00:12:16.236,00:12:19.280,How much more have you got to eat?
00:12:22.325,00:12:25.995,"Appetites aren't as big as your noses, huh?"
00:12:26.037,00:12:28.331,What?
00:12:28.373,00:12:30.542,CAROL: Let me talk to him.
00:12:30.584,00:12:32.669,I'm gonna talk-- Give him one more chance.
00:12:32.711,00:12:35.046,Barred for life.
00:12:45.682,00:12:49.477,They left.
00:12:52.063,00:12:58.236,"Bryan says he doesn't care how long you've been coming, if you ever act like this again you're barred for life."
00:12:58.278,00:13:01.322,"I'm gonna miss the excitement, but I'll handle it."
00:13:02.865,00:13:05.243,"Three eggs, over easy."
00:13:05.285,00:13:07.621,"Two sausage, six strips of bacon with fries."
00:13:07.662,00:13:09.581,Fries today?
00:13:09.623,00:13:13.876,A short stack. Coffee with cream and sweetener.
00:13:13.876,00:13:17.130,You're gonna die soon with that diet. You know that.
00:13:17.171,00:13:22.885,We're all gonna die soon.
00:13:40.069,00:13:43.448,If you ever mention my son again...
00:13:43.490,00:13:46.951,you will never be able to eat here again. Do you understand?
00:13:54.208,00:13:58.921,"Give me some sign you understand, or leave now."
00:14:01.007,00:14:06.053,"Do you understand me, you crazy fuck?"
00:14:10.600,00:14:12.352,Do you?
00:14:21.569,00:14:23.946,Yes.
00:14:23.946,00:14:25.740,Yes.
00:14:29.160,00:14:31.371,"Okay, I'll get your order."
00:14:33.206,00:14:35.375,I want you to wear my earrings tonight.
00:14:39.379,00:14:44.008,It's just so interesting what you said at dinner.
00:14:44.050,00:14:45.343,"I mean, if you-- Ahh!"
00:14:49.305,00:14:54.853,"Uh, this is sort of it."
00:14:54.977,00:14:58.272,I sort of sleep in here.
00:15:07.323,00:15:09.158,Don't worry about it.
00:15:33.725,00:15:35.101,What?
00:15:37.019,00:15:38.605,I don't know.
00:15:47.071,00:15:50.074,Grandma. Grandma!
00:15:50.116,00:15:53.870,Maybe you better check.
00:15:57.624,00:16:01.043,"BEVERLY: Oh, I'm sorry."
00:16:01.043,00:16:06.048,"I was hearing everything that you were doing, so I put these on to give you privacy."
00:16:07.508,00:16:09.844,So how was dinner?
00:16:09.886,00:16:12.096,"CAROL: Hey, pal."
00:16:12.138,00:16:13.890,Are you okay?
00:16:13.932,00:16:17.811,You got a temperature?
00:16:17.852,00:16:19.896,SPENCE: Where did your friend take you?
00:16:19.938,00:16:21.230,CAROL: A nice place.
00:16:23.149,00:16:26.360,"Carol, I have him."
00:16:26.402,00:16:30.364,One more spit?
00:16:30.406,00:16:33.117,BEVERLY: Go.
00:16:33.159,00:16:35.495,"Okay, pal. Give me a hug."
00:16:35.536,00:16:38.873,Give me a big hug.
00:16:38.915,00:16:42.084,"I'm okay, Mom."
00:16:46.714,00:16:49.926,Close the curtains.
00:16:53.513,00:16:56.557,No! You can't smoke.
00:16:59.769,00:17:02.730,Magic.
00:17:07.610,00:17:09.779,Ah.
00:17:09.821,00:17:15.743,"Oh, God! That'll teach you."
00:17:15.785,00:17:18.496,All right. Come here.
00:17:28.214,00:17:31.759,You don't have to get that embarrassed.
00:17:31.801,00:17:33.761,Little bit of throw-up?
00:17:35.805,00:17:39.475,"Well, what shall we do?"
00:17:39.517,00:17:42.645,You want me to write down which trains you take home?
00:17:42.687,00:17:46.566,"No, no, no. I'll..."
00:17:51.988,00:17:55.616,It's just a little too much reality for a Friday night.
00:18:01.205,00:18:04.542,CARL: I just can't. I promised Simon I'd find him a model.
00:18:04.584,00:18:09.047,Take me off the speaker. Did I tell you these are house seats?
00:18:09.171,00:18:14.301,Come on. You could use a break.
00:18:15.678,00:18:19.807,Hello?
00:18:21.726,00:18:23.978,"Hey, boys!"
00:18:24.020,00:18:25.605,He even bought me dinner.
00:18:25.646,00:18:27.648,"Carl, right?"
00:18:28.900,00:18:32.445,"Hey, what's going on?"
00:18:32.486,00:18:37.366,Hey. Hi. Remember?
00:18:37.408,00:18:40.620,"You picked me up, maybe a few weeks."
00:18:40.661,00:18:43.497,But this is for a portrait.
00:18:43.539,00:18:45.792,Portrait?
00:18:45.833,00:18:49.545,CARL: I'll give you the address.
00:18:49.587,00:18:53.549,Brad Pitt is the shit.
00:18:57.511,00:19:00.723,"SIMON: Who is it, baby?"
00:19:04.518,00:19:07.688,"Who is that, Verdell?"
00:19:09.774,00:19:13.360,I'm sorry.
00:19:13.402,00:19:16.072,"I was in the studio, doing a little work and I just..."
00:19:16.114,00:19:19.617,So...
00:19:19.659,00:19:23.037,You sure have great things.
00:19:23.079,00:19:27.249,"SIMON: I make a big deal about picking models, but Carl is so thorough."
00:19:27.249,00:19:31.462,"I bet he drove you nuts checking your résumé, huh?"
00:19:34.966,00:19:36.383,This is not a nude.
00:19:38.970,00:19:42.264,Just kidding around.
00:19:42.306,00:19:44.517,So much for love.
00:19:46.144,00:19:48.104,MAN: And yet another pose.
00:19:48.146,00:19:50.356,"Exactly, what is your previous experience?"
00:19:50.397,00:19:52.900,"How about that, hmm?"
00:19:52.942,00:19:54.986,I'm running out of ideas here.
00:19:57.279,00:19:59.907,"Well, then give me some direction, okay."
00:19:59.949,00:20:04.495,"Uh, nothing. I just watch until something strikes me."
00:20:04.537,00:20:07.665,"I mean, do anything you think of."
00:20:07.707,00:20:12.962,"Wait for me to say hold that pose, then just try to comfortably hold it."
00:20:14.881,00:20:16.757,No direction.
00:20:18.300,00:20:20.427,Okay.
00:20:21.888,00:20:24.765,"What I do is, I watch."
00:20:24.807,00:20:28.435,Ever watch somebody who doesn't know you're watching them?
00:20:28.477,00:20:33.273,An old woman sitting on a bus?
00:20:33.315,00:20:38.863,"Somebody just waiting, and you see this flash come over them."
00:20:38.905,00:20:44.744,And you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external because that hasn't changed.
00:20:44.785,00:20:50.499,"When you see it, they're just realer and more alive."
00:20:50.541,00:20:54.336,"I mean, you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity."
00:20:56.672,00:20:57.965,Wow.
00:20:59.926,00:21:02.929,I know exactly what you mean.
00:21:07.433,00:21:12.146,"Oh, my God. Hold it."
00:21:14.607,00:21:16.400,"MAN 1: Hey, look out."
00:21:16.442,00:21:18.652,WOMAN: Excuse me.
00:21:18.694,00:21:20.446,MAN 2: Whoa! Oh!
00:21:20.487,00:21:23.991,WAITRESS: So I got on the third line of dialogue.
00:21:24.033,00:21:27.078,And I blanked. I have no clue as to what the next line was.
00:21:27.120,00:21:29.413,Clippity-clop. Clippity-clop.
00:21:29.455,00:21:31.624,"So he said to me, Last chance."
00:21:31.665,00:21:33.918,"Oh, God."
00:21:33.960,00:21:37.379,I came back in.
00:21:37.379,00:21:38.756,And I messed up the same line.
00:21:38.798,00:21:40.007,Mmm.
00:21:40.049,00:21:42.593,But guess what.
00:21:42.635,00:21:44.762,He cast me!
00:21:44.804,00:21:47.223,Just what the world needs.
00:21:47.265,00:21:49.433,"Okay, okay. Okay."
00:21:56.274,00:21:58.400,"Can't live without me, huh?"
00:22:01.403,00:22:07.076,I'm finally gonna ask.
00:22:07.118,00:22:09.411,Why don't you try ours?
00:22:09.411,00:22:10.997,You okay?
00:22:11.038,00:22:14.208,I've seen the help.
00:22:14.250,00:22:16.502,So give yourself a little pep talk.
00:22:16.543,00:22:21.674,Try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out.
00:22:23.884,00:22:28.764,What's wrong with your son?
00:22:37.231,00:22:41.443,He's got to fight to breathe.
00:22:41.443,00:22:43.821,He's allergic to dust.
00:22:41.443,00:22:54.665,"And this is New York, so his immune system bails on him whenever there's trouble, so an ear infect-- Is this bothering you?"
00:22:54.707,00:23:02.923,"An ear infection sends us to the emergency room five, six times a month, where I get some nine-year-old they just made a doctor."
00:23:02.965,00:23:04.842,It was nice chatting with you.
00:23:04.884,00:23:09.471,Wai-- His name?
00:23:11.140,00:23:12.474,Okay.
00:23:14.601,00:23:16.812,Spence.
00:23:23.610,00:23:25.696,It's okay. It's okay.
00:23:35.581,00:23:37.958,You can put on anything you want now.
00:23:38.000,00:23:40.127,I might be done here.
00:23:38.000,00:23:42.713,I've been coming here two weeks and all we've done is work. Let's play!
00:23:45.174,00:23:47.093,Listen...
00:23:57.311,00:24:00.314,"So you're practically finished, huh?"
00:24:00.356,00:24:04.360,"Uh, yeah. There is one more stage."
00:24:05.861,00:24:07.863,Oh.
00:24:10.616,00:24:15.121,Where are you going?
00:24:26.966,00:24:31.178,"Verdell, want some chocolate?"
00:24:31.220,00:24:36.058,Wait! I gotta take off.
00:24:36.100,00:24:38.185,Yeah. He's just gotta go.
00:24:38.227,00:24:39.895,"No, wait."
00:24:39.937,00:24:42.273,"I'm gonna look at the painting, all right?"
00:24:46.819,00:24:49.322,"SIMON: Where are you going, sweetheart? Verdell."
00:24:51.573,00:24:55.119,Want some water? What's the matter with you? Come on.
00:24:55.161,00:24:57.288,You want some water?
00:25:00.749,00:25:03.336,"Simon, wait!"
00:25:05.254,00:25:06.839,Yo.
00:25:15.848,00:25:19.018,Why are you doing this?
00:25:19.059,00:25:21.854,"No. No, no, wait."
00:25:21.895,00:25:27.067,"See, that painting in there-- What, are you cruising him?"
00:25:36.618,00:25:37.870,Excuse me.
00:25:37.911,00:25:40.414,SIMON: Help me!
00:25:43.042,00:25:45.294,Come on! Come on!
00:25:57.139,00:25:59.766,"Okay, so you call 911 and don't leave your name?"
00:25:59.808,00:26:01.435,That's right. Yes.
00:26:01.643,00:26:03.896,Even a dumb geezer knows-- MELVIN: Just move on.
00:26:03.937,00:26:05.481,No one was killed.
00:26:05.523,00:26:07.107,"Oh, is he dead?"
00:26:07.149,00:26:09.943,What's wrong with you?
00:26:09.985,00:26:12.321,Don't bark at me.
00:26:12.363,00:26:17.410,"We will. And if we can't, we'll come back and ask you again and again."
00:26:17.451,00:26:20.662,"Hey, what, are you trying to intimidate me with the attitude?"
00:26:20.662,00:26:24.500,I come from hell. My grandma's got more attitude than you.
00:26:24.542,00:26:27.169,They want you inside.
00:26:24.542,00:26:29.671,MELVIN: Shake down a 7-Eleven for a day-old wiener.
00:26:29.671,00:26:31.715,There's a painting of one of the guys.
00:26:31.757,00:26:35.177,CAPTAIN: Get some tape on it.
00:26:35.219,00:26:37.804,"WOMAN: Oh, I've been praying for him since I heard."
00:26:37.846,00:26:40.974,"So anyway, I'm on my way to the hospital."
00:26:41.016,00:26:44.520,"If you could watch the dog, just for tonight."
00:26:44.562,00:26:46.897,No?
00:26:46.939,00:26:48.441,Okay. Thanks.
00:26:48.482,00:26:49.733,Uh-uh.
00:26:49.775,00:26:52.903,Old bitch. Damn dog.
00:26:57.366,00:27:00.702,You're taking him!
00:27:00.702,00:27:02.996,Get the hell out of the way!
00:27:03.038,00:27:05.249,You're taking him.
00:27:07.084,00:27:09.503,"MELVIN: No, no. Wait! Wait!"
00:27:09.545,00:27:11.505,Do you wanna say no to me?
00:27:11.547,00:27:15.468,"You wanna say no to me, huh?"
00:27:15.509,00:27:18.053,You wanna say no to me.
00:27:18.095,00:27:22.224,I don't wanna say nothing to you.
00:27:22.266,00:27:25.394,Because I've never felt this crazy as I do right now.
00:27:25.436,00:27:28.939,I almost want you to say no.
00:27:32.443,00:27:34.612,Thanks for looking after him.
00:27:34.736,00:27:38.740,Hey! Where you going?
00:27:38.740,00:27:41.743,You don't wanna mess with me today.
00:27:41.785,00:27:46.957,MELVIN: I can't take a dog.
00:27:46.999,00:27:50.461,"Hey, Frank. Frank."
00:27:50.503,00:27:53.964,"Hey, Frank. Frank!"
00:28:16.487,00:28:20.282,"One, two, three, four."
00:28:20.324,00:28:23.827,"One, two, three, four."
00:28:39.635,00:28:42.388,You're dead.
00:28:42.429,00:28:46.392,We don't have no dog food here.
00:28:46.433,00:28:49.936,You'll eat what we got.
00:28:52.606,00:28:55.609,All right.
00:29:00.113,00:29:02.491,Don't you do anything!
00:29:17.381,00:29:19.841,Where's the trust?
00:29:29.268,00:29:32.646,"MELVIN: Never, never dogs."
00:30:04.303,00:30:06.597,God!
00:30:06.639,00:30:12.018,We're not gonna sell anything if they find out we're halfway through and we haven't sold a single painting.
00:30:12.060,00:30:15.063,"No, we can't reduce the price at this stage."
00:30:15.105,00:30:17.065,Shh. Shh.
00:30:17.107,00:30:21.403,We can see him.
00:30:21.445,00:30:26.908,"I will meet you in there, okay? One minute."
00:30:26.950,00:30:28.952,"Thank you. No, I'm here."
00:30:31.580,00:30:35.668,"How are you doing, great one?"
00:30:35.709,00:30:38.420,I figured I could tell from your reaction.
00:30:41.715,00:30:45.344,"That bad, huh?"
00:30:41.715,00:30:49.014,"I talked to the doctor and-- Oh, shit! Ugh!"
00:30:49.055,00:30:52.142,"Okay, it's not that bad."
00:30:52.184,00:30:55.729,The doctors say you're gonna be your old self in a couple weeks.
00:30:55.771,00:31:00.359,"I mean, the scars here might take a little-- Oh, shit!"
00:31:01.943,00:31:06.031,"Oh. Oh, Simon."
00:31:06.072,00:31:08.200,Jackie?
00:31:08.241,00:31:10.369,"Will you hand me a mirror, please?"
00:31:10.410,00:31:12.371,No.
00:31:18.960,00:31:22.964,Wait. I have a smaller one.
00:31:28.345,00:31:29.555,Okay.
00:31:32.683,00:31:34.601,"So how are things, anyway?"
00:31:36.395,00:31:40.566,How is Verdell?
00:31:36.395,00:31:42.192,"Your neighbor, Mr. Udall, taking care of him."
00:31:42.234,00:31:45.153,How-- How could you do that?
00:31:45.195,00:31:47.989,He'll hurt him.
00:31:48.031,00:31:52.994,Not a chance. I own this guy.
00:31:53.036,00:31:56.122,"You know, I'm always on the move and..."
00:31:56.164,00:31:59.000,Trust me.
00:31:59.000,00:32:01.795,You are certain my dog is okay?
00:31:59.000,00:32:06.007,"Because you have no idea-- Yes, your dog is fine, Simon."
00:32:06.007,00:32:07.843,Okay.
00:32:10.804,00:32:12.681,Waiting gives the devil time.
00:32:30.741,00:32:33.493,"Oh, my."
00:32:43.378,00:32:46.423,Where did I go?
00:32:46.465,00:32:48.759,Look how friendly-- CAROL: That's your dog?
00:32:48.801,00:32:51.511,"No, no."
00:32:51.553,00:32:53.639,What are you doing with a dog?
00:32:54.848,00:32:56.850,"Suckered in, set up, pushed around."
00:32:56.892,00:32:59.770,You're not worried someone might take it?
00:33:02.481,00:33:06.109,"No, not until now, for chrissake."
00:33:06.151,00:33:08.779,Sorry.
00:33:10.238,00:33:12.157,"GIRL: Hey, puppy."
00:33:12.198,00:33:15.702,Hey.
00:33:17.078,00:33:18.664,BOY: I wonder what breed he is.
00:33:23.418,00:33:28.381,"He's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, bring him in."
00:33:31.176,00:33:33.971,How old are you?
00:33:34.095,00:33:37.975,"If I was gonna guess by your eyes, I'd say you were 50."
00:33:38.099,00:33:41.687,"If I went by your eyes, I'd say you were kind, so..."
00:33:41.728,00:33:44.105,"But as long as you bring up age, how old are you?"
00:33:44.105,00:33:46.942,"No, no-- You brought it up. I'm curious."
00:33:46.984,00:33:50.445,Not that you're ugly.
00:33:50.487,00:33:52.113,I can take the compliment.
00:33:52.113,00:33:56.827,But my knees start knocking when you turn on the charm.
00:33:56.869,00:34:00.539,"No, but I mean, what's with the dark?"
00:34:02.916,00:34:05.251,Dawn patrol.
00:34:05.293,00:34:09.214,Major dawn patrol.
00:34:09.255,00:34:13.719,"And this time, for extra fun they gave us the wrong antibiotics."
00:34:13.760,00:34:17.723,"So I get him home-- No, no, no!"
00:34:17.764,00:34:23.687,The dog. It's bacon for-- Bacon's for the dog.
00:34:23.729,00:34:28.149,Last week I was playing the piano for him.
00:34:28.149,00:34:32.779,So I decide I'm gonna make a little joke.
00:34:32.821,00:34:35.156,So you're all set here.
00:34:43.540,00:34:47.711,It's a beautiful day for our walk today. Very nice.
00:34:55.635,00:34:58.179,"Hey, hey."
00:34:59.806,00:35:03.518,Look at that.
00:35:03.560,00:35:08.941,I've gotta give you something. I've gotta give you something real good too.
00:35:08.982,00:35:14.071,I'm gonna show it to you.
00:35:14.195,00:35:17.198,Don't be like me.
00:35:17.240,00:35:20.201,You stay just the way you are because you are a perfect man.
00:35:20.201,00:35:23.580,And I'm gonna take you home and get you something to eat.
00:35:23.622,00:35:27.500,Aw. I'd like to be treated like that.
00:35:27.542,00:35:31.797,I'm gonna take you home right now and get you something. Yes.
00:35:31.838,00:35:35.216,Let's go home and do some writing.
00:35:35.216,00:35:40.263,He had made the girl happy. And what a girl.
00:35:40.305,00:35:43.683,"You've saved my life, she said."
00:35:45.268,00:35:48.688,You'd better make it up to me.
00:35:51.441,00:35:54.235,Done. Done!
00:35:54.277,00:35:57.739,"Yes, I hate the doggie."
00:35:57.781,00:36:02.494,Sixty-two books. Done.
00:36:02.535,00:36:05.080,JACKIE: We have to cut expenses every place we can.
00:36:05.122,00:36:08.374,WOMAN: No medical insurance?
00:36:08.416,00:36:13.672,"WOMAN: Let me see. These are the food receipts, household expenses."
00:36:13.713,00:36:17.634,Here's one for the dog again.
00:36:17.676,00:36:20.762,The laundry and the cleaners.
00:36:22.931,00:36:26.143,"MELVIN: Boy, look at that."
00:36:27.435,00:36:29.938,He likes it at Chez Melvin.
00:36:29.980,00:36:35.735,What are you coming here for?
00:36:35.777,00:36:38.030,Okay. Just sit. Good.
00:36:38.071,00:36:41.158,We don't want any company. I'll read you Ralph Waldo Emerson.
00:36:41.282,00:36:42.701,"Okay, have it your way."
00:36:49.708,00:36:52.085,Hey.
00:36:52.127,00:36:53.670,Hey.
00:36:53.712,00:36:59.801,How's Verdell doing?
00:36:59.843,00:37:03.513,Well...
00:37:03.555,00:37:07.517,Simon's home.
00:37:03.555,00:37:10.311,I was sort of hoping you can keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust?
00:37:10.311,00:37:14.440,"Well, it's been weeks and weeks."
00:37:14.482,00:37:19.612,"No, no. He wants him back right away. He'll be by tomorrow."
00:37:22.407,00:37:26.078,Okay. Okay by me.
00:37:31.750,00:37:34.669,"Hungry? Be right with you, pooch."
00:37:39.716,00:37:43.469,"One, two, three, four."
00:37:44.846,00:37:48.975,"One, two, three, four."
00:37:51.352,00:37:53.105,Okay.
00:38:00.904,00:38:02.197,Okay.
00:38:38.483,00:38:40.443,SIMON: Mr. Udall.
00:38:47.533,00:38:55.208,Some face they left hanging on you. You look like-- Could you take it...
00:38:55.250,00:38:58.419,"just a little easy, Mr. Udall?"
00:39:00.588,00:39:02.423,Thank you.
00:39:06.427,00:39:09.722,Verdell.
00:39:09.764,00:39:14.519,"Come here, my beautiful boy."
00:39:14.560,00:39:16.688,Let's go home and get well.
00:39:19.107,00:39:21.943,You can't blame him for being weird.
00:39:21.985,00:39:24.863,Look at yourself in the mirror.
00:39:28.574,00:39:30.743,Thank you.
00:39:34.039,00:39:37.125,"Come on, sweetheart."
00:39:37.167,00:39:40.461,"Verdell, come here."
00:39:42.672,00:39:45.717,I know what you want.
00:39:49.137,00:39:51.806,Come on.
00:39:57.020,00:39:59.564,"No. No, don't force him."
00:40:32.430,00:40:34.849,Over a dog!
00:40:37.936,00:40:41.439,Over an ugly dog.
00:40:48.654,00:40:53.326,Worst sidewalk in New York.
00:40:58.373,00:41:01.667,Hi. Help!
00:41:01.709,00:41:05.004,"If you wanna see me, you will not do this."
00:41:05.046,00:41:12.262,"Dr. Green, how can you diagnose someone as an obsessive-compulsive disorder and then act as though I had a choice about barging in?"
00:41:12.304,00:41:14.555,There's not going to be a debate. Leave.
00:41:14.555,00:41:16.557,You said you could help me.
00:41:16.557,00:41:21.604,What was that? A tease?
00:41:16.557,00:41:25.775,I can help if you take responsibility-- You changed the room around.
00:41:25.817,00:41:29.946,"I also regrew a beard, but you're not interested in changes in me."
00:41:29.988,00:41:34.117,I don't have this mountain of available time. I have to get to my restaurant on time.
00:41:34.159,00:41:37.078,Do you know how hard it was for me to come here?
00:41:37.120,00:41:39.580,Yes.
00:41:39.622,00:41:42.334,"No, we're not doing this now."
00:41:42.375,00:41:47.630,"I changed just one pattern, as you always said I should."
00:41:47.672,00:41:50.133,No. Nope.
00:41:53.052,00:41:55.596,"WOMAN: Oh, I read that paper."
00:41:53.052,00:42:02.103,MAN: Thank you-- What if this is as good as it gets?
00:42:02.145,00:42:03.604,MAN: Oh.
00:42:15.783,00:42:18.077,What the heck are those for?
00:42:21.039,00:42:24.209,"No, no, no. Get Carol."
00:42:24.250,00:42:26.919,"Oh, I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back."
00:42:26.961,00:42:30.089,I think she might be getting a job closer to home.
00:42:32.717,00:42:36.971,Why plastic?
00:42:37.013,00:42:41.226,What the heck do you mean?
00:42:41.267,00:42:47.023,Just go get Carol or something.
00:42:47.065,00:42:50.068,"You know, I'll pay whatever you want. I'll wait."
00:42:52.487,00:42:54.489,Do it!
00:42:57.492,00:43:00.119,"Bryan, Bryan. Code blue."
00:43:06.251,00:43:11.297,Out! Just shut up and get out. Do it!
00:43:11.339,00:43:17.678,I'll be quiet. Just let me stay here. No problem.
00:43:17.678,00:43:22.100,Go get Carol. Get her here.
00:43:22.141,00:43:27.897,I'm not a prick.
00:43:27.939,00:43:33.736,This day has been a disaster.
00:43:33.778,00:43:38.575,I'm not sure if I can handle this too.
00:43:38.699,00:43:42.703,Get out immediately or there's gonna be trouble.
00:43:42.703,00:43:44.997,"Man, I mean it."
00:43:52.922,00:43:54.382,Okay.
00:43:56.717,00:43:58.219,Yeah!
00:44:00.096,00:44:03.015,See you. Goodbye.
00:44:03.057,00:44:06.727,It's about time.
00:44:06.727,00:44:11.524,Carol's last name?
00:44:11.566,00:44:13.234,Thank you.
00:44:14.777,00:44:17.322,"BOY: Hey, Dad! Dad, I'm over here."
00:44:20.492,00:44:23.244,Does he visit often?
00:44:23.286,00:44:24.745,What can you do?
00:44:33.045,00:44:35.214,"GIRL: Can I get some ice cream, Grandpa?"
00:44:35.256,00:44:37.467,GRANDPA: Why not?
00:44:37.509,00:44:39.177,Hello.
00:44:46.851,00:44:49.354,Ay-yi-yi.
00:44:52.857,00:44:54.025,Oh!
00:44:55.234,00:44:56.653,Christ.
00:45:15.046,00:45:16.214,I'm hungry.
00:45:17.965,00:45:21.052,You've ruined my whole day.
00:45:21.093,00:45:25.890,What are you doing here?
00:45:25.931,00:45:31.437,Are you totally gone?
00:45:31.479,00:45:37.276,"I'm trying to keep emotion out of this, even though it's an important issue to me."
00:45:37.318,00:45:40.655,And I have very strong feelings on the subject.
00:45:40.697,00:45:42.407,What subject?
00:45:42.448,00:45:45.076,That I wasn't there to take crap and bring you eggs?
00:45:45.117,00:45:48.454,Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
00:45:54.210,00:45:58.839,"Yes, I do, as a matter of fact."
00:45:58.839,00:46:05.346,"And to prove it, I have not gotten personal, and you have."
00:46:05.388,00:46:09.642,Why aren't you at work?
00:46:11.852,00:46:13.979,You don't look sick.
00:46:15.856,00:46:19.444,Just tired and bitter.
00:46:21.487,00:46:24.657,"My son is sick, okay?"
00:46:27.243,00:46:30.580,What about your mother?
00:46:30.622,00:46:36.294,How do you know about my mother?
00:46:36.335,00:46:39.505,SPENCE: I finished my juice.
00:46:39.547,00:46:40.715,SPENCE: Mom.
00:46:49.474,00:46:51.684,How are you doing?
00:46:57.482,00:46:59.942,You should answer someone when they speak to you.
00:46:59.984,00:47:03.613,I'm sorry. That's it.
00:47:03.655,00:47:04.905,Ow.
00:47:07.617,00:47:09.327,Back to life.
00:47:17.543,00:47:20.588,Uh-oh.
00:47:20.630,00:47:28.012,"BOTH: Five one-thousand, four one-thousand, three one-thousand, two one-thousand-- Bingo."
00:47:29.430,00:47:30.640,104.9.
00:47:30.682,00:47:32.558,Better treat ourselves to a cab ride.
00:47:35.353,00:47:38.690,"CAROL: Look out, you guys."
00:47:38.731,00:47:42.443,"Look out, you guys."
00:47:42.485,00:47:44.487,We're okay. We're okay.
00:47:46.322,00:47:48.991,Melvin! Wait!
00:47:49.033,00:47:52.036,GIRLS: Melvin! Wait!
00:47:52.077,00:47:54.997,"Melvin, wait! Melvin, wait!"
00:47:58.125,00:47:59.960,"Shut up, kids!"
00:48:02.296,00:48:04.340,"CAROL: Give us a lift, would you, Melvin?"
00:48:08.720,00:48:12.139,Cover your mouth when you cough.
00:48:14.350,00:48:17.144,"Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital, please. And quickly."
00:48:17.186,00:48:18.604,DRIVER: Okay.
00:48:18.646,00:48:20.732,Hospital?
00:48:20.773,00:48:22.734,Any chance you'll be back at work today?
00:48:22.775,00:48:24.026,No!
00:48:24.068,00:48:25.986,Stay away from me.
00:48:30.282,00:48:37.874,"Simon, we can't put this off any longer. I feel terrible that I have to-- Simon?"
00:48:37.998,00:48:41.126,"Simon, could you just leave the dog for a second?"
00:48:43.003,00:48:45.172,SIMON: Sorry.
00:48:49.051,00:48:51.554,What are those cards?
00:48:51.596,00:48:54.682,He thought I should have notes so I did this right.
00:48:54.724,00:49:00.104,"Maintain focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you."
00:49:00.145,00:49:05.359,See? He's right.
00:49:09.405,00:49:13.534,"Simon, you're broke."
00:49:13.576,00:49:18.915,"The medical bills are 61,000."
00:49:19.039,00:49:23.920,I've spoken to your parents.
00:49:24.044,00:49:28.132,But they said they would feel strange about calling you.
00:49:28.173,00:49:32.845,"Well, I can't call them."
00:49:34.054,00:49:36.181,"Come here, baby."
00:49:36.223,00:49:40.227,Verdell? What's wrong?
00:49:40.269,00:49:42.104,You miss the tough guy?
00:49:42.146,00:49:44.941,"Well, here I am, sweetheart."
00:49:45.065,00:49:47.192,"Happy to see me, you little piss-ant mop?"
00:49:47.234,00:49:50.070,How about a ride down the chute?
00:49:50.112,00:49:52.072,"Oh, God, I'm sorry."
00:49:52.072,00:49:53.491,I'm sorry.
00:49:53.532,00:49:55.534,"I didn't mean that, sweetheart."
00:49:55.576,00:49:58.830,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
00:49:58.871,00:50:03.668,"I'll be able to keep my apartment and the studio, won't I?"
00:50:03.709,00:50:05.294,Uh...
00:50:07.171,00:50:08.339,Wow.
00:50:09.423,00:50:11.759,"Oh, my God. Wow."
00:50:40.997,00:50:42.999,"Yes, you write more than everybody else."
00:50:43.039,00:50:47.962,"You make us a lot of money. But it's more appropriate-- Look. Look, I need this."
00:50:48.004,00:50:52.383,"Just say, Melvin, I'll try."
00:50:55.219,00:50:59.264,"Melvin, I'll try."
00:50:59.306,00:51:04.020,"Now on a pleasant note, my son, he just got accepted to Brown."
00:51:04.144,00:51:06.230,My husband was dying.
00:51:06.271,00:51:11.777,"Good, nice, thrilled, exciting. You don't have to wait with me."
00:51:19.451,00:51:21.746,I can't resist.
00:51:21.787,00:51:27.167,You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask.
00:51:27.167,00:51:31.296,You have no idea what your work means to me.
00:51:31.338,00:51:34.466,What does it mean to you?
00:51:34.508,00:51:39.221,That somebody out there knows what it's like to be in here.
00:51:39.263,00:51:42.934,"Oh, God, this is like a nightmare."
00:51:42.975,00:51:47.605,"Oh, come on. Just a couple of questions."
00:51:50.942,00:51:55.446,How do you write women so well?
00:51:55.487,00:51:58.282,And I take away reason and accountability.
00:52:20.054,00:52:22.389,CAROL: M.D.
00:52:28.980,00:52:30.439,What's wrong?
00:52:30.481,00:52:33.692,Mom!
00:52:33.734,00:52:35.235,What? What?
00:52:35.235,00:52:37.362,"Please, what? Just tell me."
00:52:35.235,00:52:40.240,"I'm-- Please, just tell me!"
00:52:40.240,00:52:42.827,Not your name. What are you telling me your name for?
00:52:42.868,00:52:44.620,Where is he?
00:52:44.662,00:52:46.330,Hey.
00:52:46.371,00:52:48.082,Nothing.
00:52:48.124,00:52:50.960,You know there are doctors that come to your house?
00:52:51.002,00:52:53.253,I'm home.
00:52:53.253,00:52:55.255,I didn't know you had a secret admirer.
00:52:55.255,00:52:58.550,What?
00:52:58.592,00:53:01.971,He's good.
00:53:02.013,00:53:04.098,"Okay, doctor?"
00:53:05.432,00:53:09.269,My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.
00:53:09.311,00:53:14.775,She said I was to take care of this guy because you are urgently needed back at work.
00:53:14.817,00:53:19.321,What kind of work do you do?
00:53:19.363,00:53:23.034,In Manhattan.
00:53:23.075,00:53:27.329,"Uh, yeah, Terry."
00:53:27.371,00:53:30.082,Hi. I'm sorry it took so long.
00:53:30.124,00:53:31.792,"I couldn't find it, either."
00:53:31.834,00:53:34.753,Could you get this to the lab?
00:53:31.834,00:53:36.588,"I need C.B.C., differential, platelets, the whole thing."
00:53:36.630,00:53:38.298,And I want it today.
00:53:38.340,00:53:41.593,Did you say you were gonna get the results back today?
00:53:41.635,00:53:45.723,Sure. Let's sit down.
00:53:45.764,00:53:51.395,These are the receipts from all the prescriptions from the beginning of the year.
00:53:51.436,00:53:57.317,The calendar.
00:53:57.317,00:54:00.571,And how he felt.
00:54:00.612,00:54:03.115,How long has he had the problem?
00:54:03.157,00:54:04.616,Mm-hmm.
00:54:04.658,00:54:08.037,Have they done blood tests?
00:54:08.079,00:54:10.372,Only in the emergency room or when he was well?
00:54:10.414,00:54:14.168,Emergency room only.
00:54:14.210,00:54:17.796,No.
00:54:17.838,00:54:22.801,"No, I asked. They said my plan didn't cover it and that it wasn't necessary anyway."
00:54:22.843,00:54:24.469,Why? Should they have?
00:54:25.888,00:54:29.183,HMO bastard pieces of shit!
00:54:30.434,00:54:32.061,I'm sorry.
00:54:32.103,00:54:34.855,That's okay. I think that's their technical name.
00:54:37.024,00:54:42.362,"So once the tests come back, is there someone in your office we should talk to to get the results, or--?"
00:54:42.404,00:54:47.076,"Um, me. My home number is on the card."
00:54:48.368,00:54:49.703,That's his home number.
00:54:56.376,00:54:59.838,What?
00:55:03.383,00:55:07.638,Can we get you anything else?
00:55:07.679,00:55:09.056,"No, thank you."
00:55:09.098,00:55:13.144,Couple of female slaves?
00:55:13.185,00:55:15.980,"Mrs. Connelly, there's still a lot of tests I need to do."
00:55:16.021,00:55:18.190,A lot of things I have to find out here.
00:55:18.232,00:55:26.406,"But look, whatever I find out, I promise you at the very least, from now on your son is gonna feel a great deal better, okay?"
00:55:35.457,00:55:36.834,Doc!
00:55:40.712,00:55:45.050,No. Fine. Okay. Okay.
00:55:45.092,00:55:47.052,That's good.
00:55:48.679,00:55:51.265,"Oh, that's..."
00:55:51.307,00:55:55.435,Listen. Let me know about additional costs.
00:55:51.307,00:56:00.065,"One way or another we'll-- Well, the costs are gonna be considerable, I'm afraid."
00:56:00.107,00:56:03.861,But don't worry.
00:56:07.948,00:56:10.534,That's wonderful.
00:56:11.952,00:56:15.622,"SIMON: Anyway, dear."
00:56:15.664,00:56:17.666,"Thank you for everything, Nora."
00:56:17.708,00:56:22.921,Forgive my recent crankiness. I'll call when things get back on track.
00:56:29.345,00:56:31.263,Huh?
00:56:31.305,00:56:34.308,What's wrong?
00:56:34.350,00:56:36.685,"Oh, no."
00:56:37.978,00:56:39.146,No.
00:56:54.786,00:56:59.750,Is he dead yet?
00:56:59.791,00:57:06.257,Would there be any way that you would be willing to walk his dog for him?
00:57:06.298,00:57:11.511,Absolutely.
00:57:14.514,00:57:21.146,Two o'clock would be a good time. And here is the key in case he's asleep.
00:57:21.188,00:57:26.651,Open his curtains for him so he can see God's beautiful work.
00:57:26.693,00:57:31.531,And he'll know that even things like this happen for the best.
00:57:31.573,00:57:33.700,Where did they teach you to talk like this?
00:57:33.742,00:57:36.536,"In some Panama City Sailor, wanna hump-hump bar?"
00:57:36.578,00:57:39.581,Or is this getaway day and your last shot at his whisky?
00:57:39.623,00:57:44.295,Sell crazy someplace else.
00:57:52.552,00:57:58.225,No! No! No! There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You're not allowed block out that fact.
00:57:58.267,00:58:04.315,"Do you really want to go back to emergency, where those runt doctors keep telling us that they can't help?"
00:58:04.356,00:58:07.985,This lets a crazy man into our lives.
00:58:08.026,00:58:09.320,Come on!
00:58:11.655,00:58:15.242,You know how this will turn out.
00:58:15.284,00:58:18.287,This is not like stockings. It's not like a string of pearls.
00:58:18.329,00:58:20.664,You don't send this one back.
00:58:25.127,00:58:26.920,Right?
00:58:32.426,00:58:36.054,"SIMON: No. I do, I understand."
00:58:36.096,00:58:38.474,"All right, listen."
00:58:39.433,00:58:41.059,No.
00:58:41.101,00:58:44.855,Okay. Bye-bye.
00:58:45.939,00:58:47.858,Bye-bye.
00:58:51.862,00:58:54.239,"What a day. Come here, come here."
00:58:54.281,00:58:57.242,Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
00:58:57.284,00:58:59.495,SIMON: Thank you for walking him.
00:59:02.622,00:59:04.791,"If you'll excuse me, I'm not feeling so well."
00:59:04.833,00:59:07.752,MELVIN: This place smells like shit.
00:59:07.794,00:59:10.422,Go away.
00:59:10.464,00:59:15.719,This cleaning lady doesn't--?
00:59:17.429,00:59:19.764,What happened to your queer party friends?
00:59:19.806,00:59:22.309,Get out of here!
00:59:27.272,00:59:30.650,There's nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you.
00:59:30.692,00:59:34.279,"Nelly, you're a disgrace to depression."
00:59:38.534,00:59:42.954,"Rot in hell, Melvin."
00:59:42.996,00:59:47.709,Quit worrying. You'll be back on your knees in no time.
00:59:56.510,01:00:00.180,Is this fun for you?
01:00:00.222,01:00:04.435,"You lucky devil. It just keeps getting better and better, doesn't it?"
01:00:04.476,01:00:06.520,"I'm losing my apartment, Melvin."
01:00:06.562,01:00:12.192,"And Frank, he wants me to beg my parents, who haven't called me, for help."
01:00:12.234,01:00:14.278,And I won't.
01:00:14.319,01:00:17.697,I don't wanna paint anymore.
01:00:17.739,01:00:21.243,So the life I was trying for is over.
01:00:21.285,01:00:27.791,"The life that I had is gone, and I'm feeling so damn sorry for myself that it's difficult to breathe."
01:00:27.832,01:00:34.256,"It's high times for you, isn't it, Melvin? The gay neighbor is terrified."
01:00:34.298,01:00:36.258,Terrified!
01:00:48.019,01:00:51.982,I was just trying to give you a boost.
01:00:52.023,01:00:56.861,Lucky you.
01:00:56.903,01:01:00.949,You absolute horror of a human being.
01:01:14.129,01:01:19.343,The one thing I'll do for you-- Might cheer you up.
01:01:19.384,01:01:22.012,Get out.
01:01:22.053,01:01:26.224,You wanna know why the dog prefers me? It's not affection.
01:01:26.266,01:01:29.144,It's a... It's a trick.
01:01:30.979,01:01:32.772,I keep bacon in my pocket.
01:01:34.774,01:01:37.777,See?
01:01:37.777,01:01:40.238,"Oh, my gosh."
01:01:42.782,01:01:47.496,We'll both call him.
01:01:49.122,01:01:50.832,Okay?
01:01:56.963,01:02:00.258,"Come here, Verdell."
01:02:03.053,01:02:04.513,"Yo, yo."
01:02:04.555,01:02:08.058,Come on.
01:02:08.099,01:02:11.603,"Come here. Come here, baby."
01:02:11.645,01:02:14.398,It's okay. Come here.
01:02:17.192,01:02:19.403,Just a stupid dog.
01:02:22.489,01:02:26.243,Could you leave now? Please?
01:02:27.994,01:02:33.208,I don't get it.
01:03:24.676,01:03:25.969,MAN: Taxi!
01:03:58.251,01:04:00.253,ANNOUNCER: --Classic TV Rewind.
01:04:02.380,01:04:08.512,"On repeat viewing, one suspects that might not really be..."
01:04:08.553,01:04:10.472,Mr. Udall!
01:04:12.390,01:04:15.727,Carol the waitress?
01:04:23.067,01:04:25.570,Hi.
01:04:25.612,01:04:30.325,The doctors gave me your billing address. Sorry about the hour.
01:04:31.951,01:04:33.203,Um...
01:04:35.955,01:04:38.333,"If you're, uh..."
01:04:41.461,01:04:45.841,If you're worried about thanking me...
01:04:45.965,01:04:48.468,That's not why I'm here.
01:04:48.510,01:04:54.015,Though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer.
01:04:56.601,01:05:00.313,Note. Put it in a note.
01:05:07.404,01:05:10.031,Oh.
01:05:10.073,01:05:14.745,I have a hairdryer.
01:05:18.874,01:05:21.376,So you'd come back to work and wait on me.
01:05:21.418,01:05:24.212,Do you have some idea how strange that sounds?
01:05:27.382,01:05:49.320,I'm worried you did this be-- Are you waiting for me to say something?
01:05:53.491,01:05:56.035,Look...
01:05:57.662,01:05:59.790,I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
01:05:59.831,01:06:04.669,I don't think this can wait until tomorrow. I need to clear this up now.
01:06:04.711,01:06:06.421,Clear what up?
01:06:08.882,01:06:14.137,I'm not going to sleep with you.
01:06:15.764,01:06:17.599,Not ever!
01:06:22.186,01:06:26.441,"Well, I'm sorry, but..."
01:06:28.401,01:06:32.196,we don't open for the no-sex oaths until 9 a.m.
01:06:34.574,01:06:38.787,I'm not kidding.
01:06:42.415,01:06:44.083,I just...
01:06:46.252,01:06:47.796,Thank you.
01:06:52.884,01:06:55.887,So you'll be at work tomorrow?
01:06:58.556,01:07:00.892,Yes.
01:07:15.782,01:07:19.118,"Never, she said."
01:07:37.470,01:07:41.641,I took a-- Took a chance you were up.
01:07:41.683,01:07:44.895,I brought you some Chinese soup.
01:07:44.936,01:07:47.230,Um...
01:07:47.271,01:07:49.148,Thanks.
01:08:03.038,01:08:05.623,Boy.
01:08:05.665,01:08:08.585,Never been this tired in my life.
01:08:16.342,01:08:18.762,I haven't been sleeping.
01:08:21.180,01:08:26.436,I haven't been clear in my head or felt like myself.
01:08:29.355,01:08:32.191,I'm in trouble.
01:08:32.233,01:08:35.319,It's not just the tiredness.
01:08:35.361,01:08:39.198,Boy.
01:08:39.198,01:08:41.200,Sleepy.
01:08:41.200,01:08:47.582,Everything looks distorted and everything inside just kind of aches.
01:08:47.624,01:08:49.834,And you can barely find the will to complain.
01:08:49.876,01:08:52.796,Yeah. Yeah.
01:08:55.506,01:08:57.968,I'm glad we did this.
01:08:59.594,01:09:02.722,Good talking to you.
01:09:10.730,01:09:13.066,You are not still writing that thank-you note?
01:09:13.108,01:09:17.236,I'm on the last page.
01:09:17.236,01:09:20.698,C-O-N-S-C-I-E-N-C-E.
01:09:20.740,01:09:25.954,"Look, I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so we could go out."
01:09:25.996,01:09:30.083,I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone.
01:09:30.125,01:09:36.339,Spencer's okay. You better start finding something else to do with your free time.
01:09:36.380,01:09:38.883,"Sean, are you hungry?"
01:09:38.925,01:09:40.718,BEVERLY: All right.
01:09:40.760,01:09:43.721,We got pizza.
01:09:43.763,01:09:47.308,"Sausage, pepperoni."
01:09:48.935,01:09:54.398,"We are going out, like people do."
01:09:54.440,01:10:00.989,If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...
01:10:01.031,01:10:06.243,then I think you ought to have Mr. Udall send you over a psychiatrist.
01:10:06.285,01:10:09.497,I don't need one because I know what's really going on here.
01:10:12.375,01:10:14.460,I gotta finish this letter or I'll go nuts.
01:10:14.502,01:10:19.049,Carol-- This can't be right.
01:10:19.090,01:10:20.675,Carol!
01:10:25.388,01:10:26.681,What?
01:10:43.614,01:10:47.326,"It's very weird now, not feeling that..."
01:10:47.368,01:10:52.415,stupid panic thing inside me all the time.
01:10:52.456,01:10:55.710,"Without that, I just start thinking about myself."
01:10:55.752,01:10:59.214,And what good does that ever get anybody?
01:11:02.592,01:11:06.345,Today on the bus there was this adorable couple.
01:11:06.345,01:11:09.015,And I felt myself...
01:11:10.391,01:11:14.478,giving them a dirty look.
01:11:14.520,01:11:19.817,I just had no idea.
01:11:27.700,01:11:30.120,Go ahead.
01:11:31.370,01:11:35.458,Moving in the wrong direction.
01:11:35.499,01:11:42.006,Away from a time when I remembered what it was like to have a man to anything...
01:11:42.048,01:11:48.638,Hold fucking-- Sorry.
01:11:48.679,01:11:51.933,--hands with for chrissake.
01:11:51.975,01:11:54.185,And...
01:11:54.227,01:12:00.858,I felt almost really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.
01:12:04.028,01:12:10.910,Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to.
01:12:10.952,01:12:15.873,Poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his Mom not getting any.
01:12:20.253,01:12:26.217,Who needs these thoughts?
01:12:26.259,01:12:31.430,Leave me be.
01:12:31.472,01:12:39.189,I hope getting me thinking about everything that's wrong when all I wanna do is not do that has some purpose.
01:12:39.230,01:12:43.067,"Really, Mom, what is it you want?"
01:12:43.109,01:12:46.154,What?
01:12:54.453,01:12:56.873,Okay.
01:13:17.101,01:13:18.477,Thank you.
01:13:18.477,01:13:20.313,Now I gotta send you a thank-you note.
01:13:23.149,01:13:26.194,Everyone's here and giant Joey!
01:13:26.236,01:13:28.321,WOMAN: Emily!
01:13:28.363,01:13:31.282,FRANK: That's why you brought me here?
01:13:31.324,01:13:34.118,"Well, you know, it's not even mine."
01:13:34.160,01:13:37.496,"This guy, Simon seems to have enough on his mind."
01:13:37.496,01:13:41.584,But the dog did throw up twice last night.
01:13:41.625,01:13:44.503,"Well, take him to the vet."
01:13:44.503,01:13:47.131,They say his stomach's out of whack.
01:13:47.173,01:13:50.509,And they need him a couple of days.
01:13:51.635,01:13:54.972,FRANK: Sorry.
01:13:55.014,01:13:58.851,This is for later.
01:13:58.893,01:14:03.940,"Um, it's a note."
01:14:03.981,01:14:07.610,Yeah. It's a thank-you note.
01:14:07.651,01:14:10.196,You can read it later.
01:14:10.238,01:14:15.159,No thank-you note.
01:14:15.201,01:14:18.329,Thank you.
01:14:24.001,01:14:26.545,She's nice.
01:14:26.587,01:14:30.549,"Yeah, really nice."
01:14:33.052,01:14:38.099,"Shouldn't that be a good thing, telling somebody, No thanks required?"
01:14:38.141,01:14:39.434,Yeah.
01:14:39.558,01:14:41.560,Sure looks like it went over too.
01:14:43.396,01:14:48.567,"I mean, look at you."
01:14:48.567,01:14:52.738,You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night.
01:14:58.077,01:15:01.289,What?
01:15:01.331,01:15:04.041,"You helped with the dog, now there's other things."
01:15:04.083,01:15:06.961,"Hey, I'm as concerned about Simon as you are."
01:15:07.003,01:15:09.588,Concerned?
01:15:09.588,01:15:13.343,Hey-- He's gotta get to Baltimore to ask his parents for money tomorrow.
01:15:13.384,01:15:16.595,"Yeah, well, yeah."
01:15:13.384,01:15:19.098,"If his parents are alive, I mean, they have to help."
01:15:19.140,01:15:20.850,Good. That's great.
01:15:20.891,01:15:22.810,Let them help him.
01:15:24.437,01:15:26.897,"Only, uh..."
01:15:26.939,01:15:32.611,"I got a high-maintenence selling painter coming, so I'm out."
01:15:32.653,01:15:35.739,Can you drive him?
01:15:35.781,01:15:39.910,Think white and get serious!
01:15:39.952,01:15:44.623,Take my car? A convertible.
01:15:44.623,01:15:48.669,Do you drive?
01:15:48.711,01:15:51.130,Getting loud.
01:15:52.798,01:15:55.718,He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
01:15:55.759,01:16:03.142,I want your life where my big problem is somebody offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.
01:16:09.065,01:16:13.777,"Go ahead, girl."
01:16:13.819,01:16:15.530,I'll take him. I'll take him.
01:16:15.654,01:16:18.657,"Yeah. Get him ready, packed."
01:16:18.699,01:16:21.285,Okay. I'll take him.
01:16:21.327,01:16:23.954,Okay.
01:16:23.996,01:16:26.874,I'll see you tomorrow.
01:16:26.916,01:16:29.668,We don't enjoy one another that much.
01:16:34.382,01:16:40.804,"If there's some mental health foundation that raises money for people like you, please be sure to let me know."
01:16:40.846,01:16:42.432,Last-word freak.
01:16:42.473,01:16:45.351,CAROL: Bye-bye.
01:16:46.685,01:16:48.396,So anything else?
01:16:48.438,01:16:50.022,Yeah.
01:16:52.149,01:16:55.027,I'm gonna give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
01:16:56.862,01:17:00.408,Okay.
01:17:00.450,01:17:04.454,"What I did for you, it's working out?"
01:17:08.040,01:17:10.251,What you did changed my life.
01:17:12.211,01:17:15.172,No!
01:17:15.214,01:17:17.800,No thank-you note.
01:17:17.841,01:17:23.806,"Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life, which you won't read..."
01:17:23.847,01:17:33.065,"is that somehow, you have done more for my mother, my son and me than anybody else ever has."
01:17:33.107,01:17:37.570,I'm just gonna read you this part of it.
01:17:37.612,01:17:43.742,"And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I ever met in my life."
01:17:43.742,01:17:49.748,"And that you're gonna be in our prayers, our daily prayers, forever."
01:17:49.748,01:17:52.960,Lovely.
01:17:53.002,01:17:57.423,"I also wrote one part-- I'm just gonna say, I wrote I'm sorry."
01:17:59.425,01:18:08.184,I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you for-- For-- When you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back.
01:18:08.225,01:18:15.399,So I wrote that I was sorry about that. And that I-- I wrote I was sorry for busting you on that and for busting in on you that night...
01:18:15.441,01:18:19.778,when I said I was never...
01:18:19.778,01:18:25.535,I was sorry. And I'm sorry for every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee fill.
01:18:25.576,01:18:34.418,And I'm sorry for never spotting at the table in the restaurant the human being that had it in him to do this thing for us.
01:18:34.460,01:18:37.296,"You know what, I'm just gonna start from the beginning."
01:18:37.338,01:18:41.800,I have not been able to express my gratefulness to you.
01:18:41.800,01:18:46.055,"Even as I look at the word 'grateful' now, it doesn't begin to tell you what I feel."
01:18:48.849,01:18:50.434,Uh...
01:18:50.476,01:18:54.522,That's nice of you.
01:18:57.983,01:18:59.902,Thank you.
01:19:09.453,01:19:13.416,Now I want you to do something for me.
01:19:19.505,01:19:25.010,I'm sorry. Didn't I say what?
01:19:28.681,01:19:31.892,What?
01:19:33.185,01:19:36.939,"No, sir."
01:19:36.980,01:19:40.276,I'm afraid he might pull the stiff one-eye on me.
01:19:40.317,01:19:44.572,I need you to chaperone.
01:19:44.614,01:19:47.241,You said you liked convertibles.
01:19:47.283,01:19:50.994,I'm sorry. The stiff one-eye?
01:19:51.036,01:19:53.414,"I can't, I work."
01:19:53.456,01:19:57.668,My son.
01:19:57.710,01:20:00.546,"Melvin, I'd rather not."
01:20:00.588,01:20:02.632,"Funny, I thought it was a strong point."
01:20:02.673,01:20:04.841,Write a note. Ain't she sweet?
01:20:04.883,01:20:07.219,I need a hand and where'd she go?
01:20:07.261,01:20:11.974,Are you saying accepting your help obligates me?
01:20:12.015,01:20:16.145,Is there any other way to see it?
01:20:17.854,01:20:20.065,No.
01:20:24.861,01:20:30.200,Here's a little suitcase.
01:20:39.251,01:20:42.171,There's no way to pack for this trip.
01:21:04.401,01:21:05.944,Hello.
01:21:05.944,01:21:10.700,"You're still coming, aren't you?"
01:21:10.741,01:21:14.953,"Melvin, I would like to know exactly where we are going."
01:21:14.995,01:21:16.831,"Just south of Baltimore, Maryland."
01:21:16.955,01:21:19.583,And I know what you're gonna say.
01:21:19.625,01:21:22.961,"I mean, I-- I think I know."
01:21:22.961,01:21:27.508,"I'm not sure, but I think so."
01:21:27.550,01:21:32.388,There's no need for me to bring anything dressy?
01:21:32.429,01:21:36.517,I didn't know if we were gonna be eating in restaurants that have dress codes?
01:21:36.559,01:21:41.522,"Well, I, uh..."
01:21:41.564,01:21:43.733,Maybe.
01:21:43.774,01:21:48.987,Yes. Let's. Let's.
01:21:51.156,01:21:53.450,What did you think I was gonna ask?
01:21:53.492,01:21:56.161,Whether crabs were in season now.
01:21:56.203,01:22:00.290,"Oh, okay, then. Goodnight."
01:22:05.087,01:22:10.008,Anything unusual in his diet?
01:22:10.050,01:22:12.261,Everybody gets their own cage?
01:22:12.302,01:22:14.471,Okay. Put him in with that one. Not that one.
01:22:14.513,01:22:17.015,"Builds his confidence, huh?"
01:22:18.225,01:22:19.769,Lip kiss.
01:22:22.813,01:22:25.315,I love you. I'll miss you.
01:22:25.357,01:22:28.611,Hey! Real sensitive.
01:22:28.652,01:22:30.529,Bye.
01:22:30.571,01:22:33.449,BEVERLY: Call me when you get settled.
01:22:41.206,01:22:43.876,"Don't worry, Mom."
01:22:43.918,01:22:46.253,"Have fun, don't worry!"
01:22:46.295,01:22:49.047,"Have fun, but don't run."
01:22:49.047,01:22:50.173,Bye!
01:22:54.428,01:22:56.430,FRANK: Sorry I'm not taking you myself.
01:22:56.472,01:22:58.474,"SIMON: So am I, Frank."
01:22:58.515,01:23:00.309,FRANK: Give me a hug.
01:23:02.060,01:23:03.395,Everything's gonna be okay.
01:23:03.437,01:23:05.147,All right?
01:23:05.188,01:23:10.903,Soak it up. It's your last chance for a hug for a few days.
01:23:16.575,01:23:19.077,Hello.
01:23:21.914,01:23:24.374,Hi.
01:23:24.416,01:23:26.209,Hi.
01:23:26.251,01:23:30.506,Thank you for being on time.
01:23:30.547,01:23:33.216,Hi.
01:23:33.258,01:23:36.887,Carol the waitress.
01:23:38.931,01:23:40.683,Hello.
01:23:40.724,01:23:44.895,Holy God.
01:23:44.937,01:23:50.108,"Um, I was attacked."
01:23:50.150,01:23:55.113,And I was hospitalized.
01:23:55.113,01:23:58.116,I almost died.
01:23:58.116,01:23:59.869,"Uh, let's go."
01:24:02.955,01:24:05.457,I was gonna do that for you.
01:24:05.499,01:24:07.334,Where should we sit?
01:24:07.376,01:24:13.423,There's no place cards or anything-- It's all right. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
01:24:13.465,01:24:16.134,So I'll sit in the back.
01:24:29.857,01:24:33.777,Never a break. Never.
01:24:33.819,01:24:37.573,I'm sorry. Thank you for the seat. It was very thoughtful.
01:24:37.614,01:24:41.577,You look like you're crowded in there.
01:24:43.829,01:24:45.205,Thanks.
01:24:53.338,01:24:55.173,Thank you.
01:24:57.801,01:24:59.720,You're welcome.
01:25:03.515,01:25:08.311,I've got the whole trip programmed.
01:25:10.689,01:25:15.694,I'm just kidding.
01:25:15.736,01:25:18.614,"No, seriously."
01:25:18.655,01:25:22.492,We've got good stuff here.
01:25:37.758,01:25:40.385,I like this music.
01:25:42.387,01:25:44.598,I like this music.
01:25:59.237,01:26:03.241,CAROL: They did something really off for you to feel this way.
01:26:03.283,01:26:06.495,But when it comes to your parents or your kid...
01:26:06.536,01:26:11.249,"something will always be off for you, unless you set it straight."
01:26:11.249,01:26:16.046,And maybe this thing happened to you to give you a chance to do that.
01:26:16.088,01:26:19.049,Nonsense.
01:26:19.091,01:26:23.053,"Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say, raise their hand."
01:26:31.728,01:26:34.272,You wanna know what happened with my parents?
01:26:34.272,01:26:35.941,Yes.
01:26:37.275,01:26:38.902,When I was a kid-- Wait.
01:26:38.944,01:26:41.989,I'm gonna pull over.
01:26:45.909,01:26:50.956,I always painted.
01:26:50.998,01:26:55.377,She was really sort of fabulous about it.
01:26:55.418,01:27:01.508,And she used to...
01:27:01.550,01:27:05.054,And she was very natural.
01:27:05.095,01:27:08.724,So she used to pose nude for me.
01:27:08.765,01:27:13.687,And I always thought or I guess I assumed that my father knew about it.
01:27:13.729,01:27:17.024,This stuff is pointless.
01:27:17.066,01:27:19.317,You like sad stories?
01:27:19.317,01:27:21.570,Stop!
01:27:23.572,01:27:27.201,"Go ahead, really. Please don't let him stop you."
01:27:27.325,01:27:29.036,Um...
01:27:29.078,01:27:34.457,One day he walked in and he found us.
01:27:34.499,01:27:37.836,My father didn't come out of his room for 11 years.
01:27:37.878,01:27:42.799,He hit me with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
01:27:44.051,01:27:45.219,Huh?
01:27:47.470,01:27:51.892,"Go ahead, Simon."
01:27:51.934,01:27:55.229,Uh-huh.
01:27:55.353,01:27:59.691,"Um, he was..."
01:27:59.733,01:28:04.821,"Yeah, um, I was defending my mother."
01:28:04.863,01:28:11.369,I was trying to make peace in the lamest way.
01:28:11.369,01:28:16.374,"I said, She's not naked."
01:28:19.544,01:28:22.839,And he started hitting me.
01:28:22.881,01:28:26.551,And he beat me unconscious.
01:28:26.593,01:28:30.097,And he talked to me less and less.
01:28:30.139,01:28:33.850,He knew what I was before I did.
01:28:33.892,01:28:38.772,The morning I left for college he walked into my room.
01:28:38.814,01:28:44.236,And he held out his hand.
01:28:45.695,01:28:52.410,A big sweaty wad of money.
01:28:52.410,01:28:57.749,"And he said, I don't want you to ever come back."
01:28:57.791,01:29:02.004,And I just grabbed him and I hugged him.
01:29:02.045,01:29:05.674,And he turned and walked out.
01:29:15.725,01:29:21.606,We all have these terrible stories to get over-- MELVIN: It's not true.
01:29:21.648,01:29:24.693,Some of us have great stories.
01:29:24.734,01:29:30.740,That take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad.
01:29:30.782,01:29:35.912,Just no one in this car.
01:29:35.954,01:29:41.751,"Good times, noodle salad."
01:29:35.954,01:29:46.173,"What makes it so hard is not that you had it bad, but that you're that pissed that so many others had it good."
01:29:46.215,01:29:52.221,No! I don't think so.
01:29:52.262,01:29:54.723,"Not it at all, huh?"
01:29:54.764,01:30:00.478,Okay. Let's go to the hotel.
01:30:00.478,01:30:06.360,"Tomorrow, you'll see if you can get another big wad of sweaty money out of his hand."
01:30:15.535,01:30:18.538,Can I ask you a personal question?
01:30:20.999,01:30:24.294,Sure.
01:30:24.336,01:30:28.298,You ever get an erection over a woman?
01:30:28.340,01:30:29.841,Melvin.
01:30:29.883,01:30:33.303,Wouldn't your life be easier if you weren't--?
01:30:33.345,01:30:35.389,You consider your life easy?
01:30:37.515,01:30:41.895,All right. I give you that one.
01:30:44.480,01:30:47.192,Nice packing.
01:30:50.862,01:30:52.197,Whoa.
01:30:54.408,01:30:56.492,"Hey, Spence."
01:30:56.534,01:30:59.955,"SPENCE: Hey, Mom. Wait till you hear..."
01:30:59.996,01:31:04.376,Why are you out of breath?
01:31:04.418,01:31:08.630,You did?
01:31:08.671,01:31:13.843,"That's great. Oh, my God!"
01:31:13.885,01:31:17.639,We're playing again. Gotta go.
01:31:13.885,01:31:24.854,Wait. Just tell me-- BEVERLY: He scored a goal.
01:31:24.896,01:31:27.023,"Oh, you would have died."
01:31:28.733,01:31:32.988,My son was outside playing soccer.
01:31:33.029,01:31:35.782,Come on. Take me out for a good time.
01:31:35.824,01:31:39.328,Take me out dancing.
01:31:39.369,01:31:42.872,I can't. I'm exhausted.
01:31:42.914,01:31:44.207,No.
01:31:44.249,01:31:45.583,No.
01:31:45.625,01:31:47.377,No.
01:31:47.419,01:31:51.173,All right. All right.
01:31:51.214,01:31:56.345,Are you sad or something?
01:31:56.386,01:32:00.098,"It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along."
01:32:00.140,01:32:01.850,What a nice compliment.
01:32:15.113,01:32:16.323,I'm happy.
01:32:18.033,01:32:20.118,And you're my date.
01:32:21.786,01:32:26.249,Let's get dressed.
01:32:26.291,01:32:27.459,Uh...
01:32:32.630,01:32:38.094,I'm gonna jump in the shower.
01:33:15.465,01:33:18.843,All set?
01:33:22.931,01:33:25.141,MELVIN: Sell hard-shell crabs?
01:33:25.183,01:33:28.228,MELVIN: Do they sell hard-shells?
01:33:36.152,01:33:39.489,Do they sell hard-shells?
01:33:39.531,01:33:42.867,Excuse-- Thank you.
01:33:42.909,01:33:45.412,Good evening.
01:33:45.454,01:33:47.747,You have hard-shells?
01:33:47.789,01:33:49.707,"Just him, that's all."
01:33:49.707,01:33:53.211,We worked it out.
01:33:53.253,01:33:55.880,"Oh, and I can give you a tie and jacket."
01:33:55.922,01:33:57.715,What?
01:33:57.715,01:34:00.927,They require a tie and jacket.
01:34:11.896,01:34:14.357,Sir?
01:34:14.399,01:34:17.277,No. I'm not putting that on.
01:34:17.319,01:34:21.490,And I won't let you inject me with the plague either.
01:34:21.531,01:34:26.869,"It's a nice place. You dry-clean these all the time, don't you?"
01:34:26.911,01:34:29.831,I don't think so.
01:34:36.171,01:34:38.507,Well... You...
01:34:38.548,01:34:39.882,"just, uh..."
01:34:39.924,01:34:43.219,Wait here. Excuse me.
01:34:55.106,01:34:56.650,Good evening.
01:34:58.776,01:35:02.155,I need a coat and tie.
01:35:02.197,01:35:03.657,No.
01:35:05.283,01:35:08.119,No?
01:35:08.161,01:35:12.207,This one?
01:35:21.341,01:35:23.134,Excuse me.
01:35:26.971,01:35:30.892,She's here.
01:35:30.933,01:35:32.644,Thanks.
01:35:32.686,01:35:38.107,Should I get her for you?
01:35:43.488,01:35:47.617,Can I buy you a drink?
01:36:22.485,01:36:23.861,Ma'am.
01:36:23.861,01:36:25.280,Hmm? Oh.
01:36:31.869,01:36:33.913,"Oh, wait."
01:36:41.421,01:36:44.132,The maitre d' is following me.
01:37:04.026,01:37:11.993,You look so se-- You look great.
01:37:13.369,01:37:14.912,You look great.
01:37:25.799,01:37:28.426,You wanna dance?
01:37:28.468,01:37:31.638,I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
01:37:31.680,01:37:33.014,And?
01:37:33.055,01:37:34.932,No.
01:37:36.309,01:37:40.062,I don't get this place.
01:37:40.104,01:37:44.400,They make me buy a new outfit and let you in in a housedress.
01:37:44.442,01:37:47.445,I don't get it.
01:37:47.487,01:37:53.743,What? Wait.
01:37:53.785,01:37:56.078,Uh...
01:37:56.120,01:38:00.082,I didn't mean it that way.
01:38:00.124,01:38:03.211,Still give me the dirty look.
01:38:03.252,01:38:05.505,"Pay me a compliment, Melvin."
01:38:05.547,01:38:08.675,I need one. Quick.
01:38:08.717,01:38:12.970,You have no idea how much what you just said hurt my feelings.
01:38:12.970,01:38:17.809,The minute someone gets that they need you they threaten to walk out.
01:38:17.851,01:38:22.564,A compliment is something nice about somebody else.
01:38:22.605,01:38:26.025,Now or never.
01:38:35.660,01:38:36.994,And mean it.
01:38:49.131,01:38:52.093,Can we order first?
01:38:53.720,01:38:55.012,Okay.
01:38:55.054,01:38:56.472,Um...
01:38:58.057,01:39:02.520,Two hard-shell crab dinners.
01:39:02.562,01:39:06.816,Baked or fries?
01:39:08.359,01:39:12.029,Fries.
01:39:12.071,01:39:17.326,I'll tell your waiter.
01:39:17.368,01:39:22.916,"Okay, now. I've got a great compliment for you."
01:39:23.040,01:39:25.126,And it's true.
01:39:25.167,01:39:28.087,I'm so afraid it's something awful.
01:39:28.129,01:39:31.841,Don't be pessimistic.
01:39:31.883,01:39:35.845,Okay. Here I go.
01:39:35.887,01:39:38.264,Clearly a mistake.
01:39:39.891,01:39:44.353,"I've got this-- What, ailment."
01:39:48.399,01:39:58.785,"My doctor, a shrink that I used to go to all the time, says that in 50 or 60 percent of the cases a pill really helps."
01:39:58.827,01:40:02.204,I hate pills.
01:40:02.246,01:40:07.209,Hate. I'm using the word hate here about pills.
01:40:07.251,01:40:12.966,"My compliment is, the night you came over and told me you would never..."
01:40:13.006,01:40:14.884,Um...
01:40:14.926,01:40:19.514,"All right, well, you were there."
01:40:19.555,01:40:22.099,"Well, my compliment to you is..."
01:40:22.141,01:40:27.897,the next morning I started taking the pills.
01:40:31.567,01:40:34.236,I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.
01:40:39.909,01:40:42.495,You make me wanna be a better man.
01:40:54.841,01:40:59.387,That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
01:41:03.683,01:41:08.771,"Well, maybe I overshot a little to keep you from walking out."
01:41:21.409,01:41:23.160,How's it going with those pills?
01:41:24.579,01:41:26.956,"Good, I hope, I hope, I hope."
01:41:29.250,01:41:31.586,"Well, it's, uh..."
01:41:32.921,01:41:36.424,It's little by little.
01:41:36.465,01:41:41.971,It's exhausting talking like this. Exhausting.
01:42:01.198,01:42:06.287,Do you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
01:42:06.328,01:42:08.831,Never.
01:42:08.873,01:42:11.292,Here's the trouble with never.
01:42:33.564,01:42:39.236,You don't owe me that.
01:42:39.236,01:42:44.659,"When you first came into breakfast, when I first saw you, I thought you were handsome."
01:42:45.994,01:42:49.413,"Then, of course, you spoke."
01:42:50.915,01:42:53.709,So now that your...
01:42:53.751,01:42:58.047,soft little underbelly is all exposed...
01:42:58.089,01:43:02.426,"tell me, why did you bring me here?"
01:43:04.887,01:43:06.472,"Well, I..."
01:43:11.727,01:43:17.274,That's a personal question.
01:43:17.274,01:43:21.403,Scared?
01:43:21.445,01:43:26.075,"It's okay. If you ask me, I'll say yes."
01:43:27.910,01:43:29.871,"Well, I..."
01:43:29.912,01:43:33.582,I... I...
01:43:33.624,01:43:36.127,There's a lot of reasons.
01:43:36.169,01:43:40.422,"I thought-- One thought, maybe if you had sex with Simon..."
01:43:40.464,01:43:43.634,What?
01:43:43.676,01:43:49.515,That's just one idea.
01:43:49.557,01:43:54.103,"Like I'm a, what?"
01:43:54.145,01:43:59.025,I don't know why I brought you.
01:43:59.067,01:44:02.737,It came out first.
01:44:02.778,01:44:07.075,"You kiss him, me."
01:44:07.116,01:44:11.954,Wait. I didn't mean-- Forget what I said about Simon.
01:44:11.996,01:44:15.917,I'll never forget you said it.
01:44:15.958,01:44:18.335,It was a mistake.
01:44:22.965,01:44:25.384,FRED'S VOICE: This is Fred Bishop.
01:44:25.426,01:44:26.969,BETTY'S VOICE: And Betty.
01:44:27.011,01:44:28.846,FRED: We're unable to take your call.
01:44:28.888,01:44:32.975,Leave a message.
01:44:33.017,01:44:34.602,FRED: Goodbye.
01:44:34.643,01:44:38.147,It's Simon.
01:44:38.189,01:44:41.358,I'm in town.
01:44:41.358,01:44:45.362,Hello?
01:44:45.362,01:44:51.160,You haven't been out later than 10:00 in your lives.
01:44:53.412,01:44:56.373,Really.
01:44:59.710,01:45:04.381,"Okay, well, I'm gonna try you in the morning."
01:45:04.423,01:45:07.384,Or at least get you to answer the phone.
01:45:16.102,01:45:19.021,How are you?
01:45:19.063,01:45:21.190,Is this gonna be your room?
01:45:21.232,01:45:24.652,I don't wanna see him.
01:45:24.693,01:45:28.781,What happened?
01:45:31.408,01:45:34.162,Can you not be so violent?
01:45:34.203,01:45:36.580,Do you need help with--?
01:45:38.958,01:45:42.253,I'm taking a big bath and ordering a big meal.
01:45:42.295,01:45:45.673,I'm sorry.
01:45:45.714,01:45:49.677,Don't ask. I'm tired of my complaints. I gotta get some new thoughts.
01:45:49.718,01:45:55.933,What are you thinking about?
01:45:55.975,01:45:59.103,"Can you believe, in our mix you're the good roommate?"
01:46:12.908,01:46:15.161,Goodnight.
01:46:57.245,01:47:01.290,Hold it.
01:47:20.017,01:47:23.396,I have to draw you.
01:47:25.522,01:47:28.859,I have to draw you.
01:47:28.901,01:47:33.655,I'm more shy than people think.
01:47:33.697,01:47:39.536,I haven't sketched in weeks.
01:47:39.578,01:47:44.959,"But you're beautiful, Carol."
01:47:45.000,01:47:48.963,The back. The line of you.
01:47:49.004,01:47:54.302,You're why cavemen chiseled on walls.
01:47:55.552,01:47:57.888,Cut me a break.
01:48:21.745,01:48:26.708,MELVIN: The next thing I know she's sitting next to me.
01:48:26.750,01:48:32.298,It's not right to go into details. I got nervous.
01:48:32.340,01:48:34.842,I screwed up.
01:48:38.720,01:48:41.890,"Where, if I hadn't..."
01:48:41.932,01:48:45.936,I could be in bed now with a woman who...
01:48:45.978,01:48:50.065,"if you make her laugh, you got a life."
01:48:51.275,01:48:54.362,"Instead, I'm here with you."
01:48:54.403,01:48:59.408,"No offense, but a moron pushing the last legal drug."
01:49:02.911,01:49:05.039,"Jameson, soda back."
01:49:07.624,01:49:11.962,I don't care how you put this.
01:49:12.004,01:49:17.092,"No, this is... This is great."
01:49:17.134,01:49:21.889,My hand won't even keep up. Hold it.
01:49:21.930,01:49:24.641,CAROL: I'm just turning.
01:49:24.683,01:49:26.727,"CAROL: Okay, this?"
01:49:26.768,01:49:30.523,My hand's not even bothering me.
01:49:30.647,01:49:32.483,I just-- I...
01:49:32.525,01:49:36.362,I can't get the angle with this cast.
01:49:39.823,01:49:42.243,Careful.
01:49:53.170,01:49:56.840,MELVIN: I'm coming in. It's late.
01:50:02.430,01:50:04.681,Did you have sex with her?
01:50:04.723,01:50:08.185,CAROL: Don't you want your shampoos?
01:50:12.022,01:50:14.567,Sorry.
01:50:14.607,01:50:19.654,I didn't know she was still here.
01:50:19.696,01:50:25.411,To hell with sex. It was better than sex. We held each other.
01:50:25.453,01:50:31.417,"What I need, he gave me great."
01:50:36.464,01:50:39.383,I just love her.
01:50:44.555,01:50:47.600,How are you doing?
01:51:02.323,01:51:04.283,BETTY: Hello?
01:51:04.325,01:51:05.993,"Hello, Simon."
01:51:06.034,01:51:08.245,You were right.
01:51:08.287,01:51:10.539,Do you have to whisper?
01:51:10.581,01:51:15.752,I'm not a screamer.
01:51:15.752,01:51:19.756,Your father is not well.
01:51:19.756,01:51:23.552,Hold on.
01:51:23.594,01:51:28.015,"I get why you're angry with me, but-- CAROL: Shh. He's talking to his parents."
01:51:28.056,01:51:32.853,Listen to me. Truly no grudges.
01:51:32.894,01:51:37.774,It was odd that you didn't come and see me when you heard I was hurt.
01:51:37.774,01:51:40.777,We almost did.
01:51:40.777,01:51:45.366,The important thing is that your son is happy.
01:51:45.407,01:51:48.785,I'm working again.
01:51:45.407,01:51:53.415,"Good. About money-- No, I don't need anything."
01:51:53.457,01:51:56.084,It's up to you to make the next move.
01:51:56.126,01:52:02.216,MELVIN: He's gonna wanna stay. They'll take a ride to the lake.
01:52:02.257,01:52:05.553,"Okay, bye-bye."
01:52:05.594,01:52:08.096,"Bye, Mom."
01:52:08.138,01:52:14.811,We'll probably have a five-hour drive. It'll give us a chance-- So?
01:52:14.811,01:52:18.315,I'm coming with you.
01:52:18.357,01:52:22.277,No. I'll take care of myself.
01:52:22.319,01:52:23.571,You've got real problems.
01:52:23.612,01:52:27.658,I know.
01:52:27.700,01:52:31.828,Suddenly everything seems so easy.
01:52:31.828,01:52:35.249,"Carol, a load has been lifted."
01:52:37.585,01:52:42.464,One night with me.
01:52:42.506,01:52:45.133,"MELVIN: Oh, jeez."
01:52:45.175,01:52:50.639,No choice.
01:52:50.681,01:52:55.310,Let me see. Gorgeous.
01:52:55.352,01:53:00.274,Do it. And get the dog picked up. I can't believe he let it stay there.
01:53:00.315,01:53:03.277,Goodbye.
01:53:03.318,01:53:05.613,Your luck's running.
01:53:05.654,01:53:11.201,They sub-let your place.
01:53:11.243,01:53:16.957,Frank's got a line on a new place.
01:53:16.998,01:53:18.166,Does it matter?
01:53:21.878,01:53:25.048,"No, it doesn't."
01:53:25.090,01:53:28.343,I'm fine. Like the hat?
01:53:30.053,01:53:31.888,I'm sorry.
01:54:04.338,01:54:08.342,I don't wanna hear that music now.
01:54:08.383,01:54:09.926,I don't.
01:54:12.262,01:54:15.808,This one has a meaning.
01:54:15.932,01:54:18.519,If that means anything.
01:54:38.288,01:54:40.791,"MELVIN: Yes, sir. All right."
01:54:40.833,01:54:45.212,Here's the keys to my apartment.
01:54:45.253,01:54:49.633,Go up there and wait and I'll take Carol home.
01:54:49.675,01:54:54.137,I'll take a bus.
01:54:59.643,01:55:02.688,Can you come here?
01:55:02.730,01:55:06.608,I don't care what you did for me.
01:55:06.650,01:55:08.985,I don't think I wanna know you anymore.
01:55:08.985,01:55:12.781,All you do is make me feel bad about myself.
01:55:15.450,01:55:18.286,You have my number.
01:55:19.788,01:55:25.001,Let him take you home.
01:55:25.001,01:55:28.255,I love you.
01:55:38.014,01:55:40.016,Don't say anything.
01:55:43.019,01:55:49.150,I gotta get ahold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat.
01:55:49.192,01:55:53.280,I think you're gonna have to camp it here.
01:55:53.321,01:55:55.616,There's Verdell!
01:55:57.492,01:55:58.702,Look at you.
01:56:02.122,01:56:04.750,Feel like your old self.
01:56:04.792,01:56:08.295,Mommy and Daddy are home.
01:56:09.880,01:56:15.218,Sorry. You're fun to mess with.
01:56:15.260,01:56:17.053,They rented your place furnished.
01:56:17.095,01:56:20.808,Jackie said she'd bring your things.
01:56:20.849,01:56:25.854,They were gonna set you up in here. It's an extra room.
01:56:25.896,01:56:30.818,It's got good light.
01:56:35.864,01:56:39.910,It's nice. Looks good.
01:56:41.077,01:56:44.289,They got your music...
01:56:44.331,01:56:47.751,"paintings, paints."
01:56:47.793,01:56:50.170,I have to say they did a good job.
01:56:53.089,01:56:55.091,It's gonna be okay.
01:56:55.133,01:56:58.094,"Cozy, huh?"
01:57:03.934,01:57:08.605,"Thank you, Melvin."
01:57:15.863,01:57:17.113,I love you.
01:57:23.745,01:57:25.956,"I tell you, buddy..."
01:57:25.998,01:57:30.335,I'd be the luckiest guy alive if that did it for me.
01:57:37.133,01:57:38.426,"Well, uh..."
01:57:42.514,01:57:46.142,Make yourself at home.
01:57:47.561,01:57:50.146,Anything else in the bag?
01:57:50.146,01:57:52.357,But I was playing soccer while you were away.
01:57:52.399,01:57:57.863,I know.
01:57:57.905,01:58:02.993,It's got wonderful recipes.
01:58:03.035,01:58:08.373,Shark with a bite.
01:58:08.415,01:58:10.542,And some cookies here called Wasps' Nests.
01:58:14.629,01:58:18.258,SIMON: Where is my big hairy boy?
01:58:18.299,01:58:22.930,Where is he?
01:58:22.971,01:58:24.180,Sweetheart!
01:58:25.557,01:58:28.936,"Oh, you're in bed."
01:58:30.771,01:58:32.898,"Yeah, um..."
01:58:32.940,01:58:39.780,"Melvin, I just didn't think Verdell should get too comfortable sleeping here."
01:58:39.821,01:58:43.825,The dog's already comfortable.
01:58:47.495,01:58:49.372,Is this okay?
01:58:51.374,01:58:55.211,"Hello. Hi, it's me. Hi!"
01:58:55.211,01:59:00.801,Yes. He took me in.
01:59:00.842,01:59:06.222,Jackie brought it all over and-- Just take the dog.
01:59:06.264,01:59:07.808,Gotta go.
01:59:07.849,01:59:11.979,"Oh, come here."
01:59:12.020,01:59:17.442,Come on. Move fast. Don't limp.
01:59:29.579,01:59:31.999,Hello.
01:59:32.040,01:59:33.834,Yeah.
01:59:33.875,01:59:37.087,How are you doing?
01:59:37.129,01:59:43.259,Why? What's wrong?
01:59:43.259,01:59:49.641,Maybe both.
01:59:49.683,01:59:54.521,Cute.
01:59:54.562,01:59:57.691,Just listen to me.
01:59:57.732,02:00:02.112,It's really something that you're looking after Simon.
02:00:02.154,02:00:08.035,And what I said on the street...
02:00:08.076,02:00:14.541,It made me sick to my stomach.
02:00:14.582,02:00:19.212,And I'd be lying if I didn't say I enjoy your company.
02:00:20.922,02:00:27.220,But you do bother me.
02:00:27.261,02:00:31.933,to not have contact with you because you're not ready.
02:00:31.975,02:00:36.646,You're an old guy to not be ready. And I'm too old to ignore that.
02:00:36.688,02:00:42.276,But there were extraordinary kindnesses that did take place.
02:00:49.076,02:00:51.912,"So anyway, thanks for the trip."
02:00:53.830,02:00:59.293,Goodnight.
02:01:03.464,02:01:05.800,Go ahead.
02:01:06.927,02:01:09.096,I should have danced with you.
02:01:14.350,02:01:15.643,Goodnight.
02:01:37.373,02:01:41.044,Are you gonna talk to me or not?
02:01:52.388,02:01:57.518,What did she say?
02:01:57.560,02:02:00.855,And she doesn't want contact with me.
02:02:02.899,02:02:05.819,I'm dying here.
02:02:07.070,02:02:09.114,Because...
02:02:09.156,02:02:13.160,you love her.
02:02:13.201,02:02:16.579,And you people are supposed to be sensitive?
02:02:16.621,02:02:20.875,Then you tell me why.
02:02:20.917,02:02:22.169,I don't know.
02:02:22.210,02:02:25.005,Let me sleep on it.
02:02:25.046,02:02:30.218,I'll figure it out.
02:02:30.260,02:02:36.516,I'm stuck. I can't get back to my old life.
02:02:38.768,02:02:43.773,She's evicted me from my life.
02:02:43.815,02:02:47.194,It's better than this.
02:02:47.235,02:02:51.781,"If you're gonna give me hope, you've gotta do better than you're doing."
02:02:51.823,02:02:55.869,"If you can't be mildly interesting, then shut up."
02:02:55.910,02:03:00.040,I'm drowning here!
02:03:00.081,02:03:04.252,Picking on me won't help.
02:03:04.294,02:03:08.256,"If that's true, I'm really in trouble."
02:03:08.298,02:03:12.468,"Melvin, do you know where you're lucky?"
02:03:17.140,02:03:20.935,You know who you want.
02:03:20.977,02:03:27.192,I would take your seat any day.
02:03:27.234,02:03:32.613,Tonight. It's not always good to let things calm down.
02:03:32.655,02:03:36.784,"You can do this, Melvin."
02:03:36.826,02:03:40.247,Tell her how you feel.
02:03:40.288,02:03:44.625,I'm charged.
02:03:44.667,02:03:49.505,She might kill me if I go there.
02:03:49.505,02:03:55.345,The best thing going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself.
02:03:55.387,02:03:59.099,So go over there.
02:04:04.312,02:04:06.731,Okay.
02:04:08.983,02:04:11.569,Thanks a lot.
02:04:13.321,02:04:16.199,Here I go.
02:04:25.166,02:04:28.253,What's wrong?
02:04:29.545,02:04:32.590,I forgot to lock the door.
02:05:50.960,02:05:54.714,What do you want?
02:05:54.755,02:05:57.925,I wasn't asleep.
02:06:01.388,02:06:03.056,What a break.
02:06:05.308,02:06:08.102,Is it a secret what you're doing here?
02:06:11.272,02:06:12.982,I had to see you.
02:06:17.404,02:06:19.655,Because?
02:06:22.116,02:06:24.660,It relaxes me.
02:06:26.662,02:06:30.917,I'd feel better sitting outside your apartment on the curb...
02:06:30.958,02:06:35.463,than any other place I can think of or imagine.
02:06:35.505,02:06:38.258,That's overstating.
02:06:38.299,02:06:44.305,I'd rather be sitting inside so I don't get my feet in the gutter.
02:06:44.347,02:06:49.977,Stop. Why can't I just have a normal boyfriend? Why?
02:06:50.019,02:06:53.940,A regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me.
02:06:53.981,02:06:57.402,"Everybody wants that, dear."
02:07:00.988,02:07:05.993,I'm sorry.
02:07:12.208,02:07:15.378,Boyfriend.
02:07:18.089,02:07:23.803,Come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
02:07:23.844,02:07:26.598,Maybe we could live without the wisecracks?
02:07:31.352,02:07:32.895,Maybe we could.
02:08:00.006,02:08:05.052,It feels a little confined here.
02:08:07.930,02:08:14.270,It's 4 in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me.
02:08:14.312,02:08:20.276,If you don't mind.
02:08:20.318,02:08:24.780,there's a bakery on the corner that'll be open soon.
02:08:24.780,02:08:30.537,"That way we're not screwy, just two people that like warm rolls."
02:08:34.790,02:08:36.459,Okay.
02:08:54.810,02:09:01.108,What are you doing?
02:09:17.958,02:09:19.835,Thank you.
02:09:21.588,02:09:42.734,"You know, I was h-- I'm sorry. Whatever this is is not gonna work."
02:09:52.326,02:09:54.870,I'm...
02:09:56.872,02:09:59.875,"I'm feeling better, Carol."
02:09:59.875,02:10:07.592,"Melvin, even though it may seem that way now, you don't know me all that well."
02:10:07.634,02:10:10.803,I'm not the answer for you.
02:10:10.844,02:10:15.057,I've got a great compliment for you.
02:10:15.099,02:10:19.853,Just let me talk.
02:10:19.895,02:10:21.147,Just...
02:10:25.568,02:10:32.659,I might be the only person on the earth that knows you're the greatest woman on earth.
02:10:32.700,02:10:40.625,I might be the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing that you do.
02:10:40.667,02:10:44.962,And how you are with Spencer. Spence.
02:10:46.380,02:10:48.675,And in every single thought you have.
02:10:48.716,02:10:50.134,And how you say what you mean.
02:10:50.176,02:10:57.183,And how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good.
02:10:59.686,02:11:02.522,Most people miss that about you.
02:11:02.563,02:11:12.365,I wonder how they can watch you bring their food and clear tables and never get that they just met the greatest woman alive.
02:11:12.406,02:11:18.412,And the fact that I get it makes me feel good...
02:11:18.454,02:11:22.542,about me.
02:11:29.089,02:11:34.261,Is that something that it's bad for you to be around?
02:11:44.731,02:11:47.066,No.
02:11:49.861,02:11:53.280,I'm gonna grab you.
02:11:53.322,02:11:57.993,I didn't mean for that to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
02:12:21.308,02:12:24.270,I know I can do better than that.
02:12:47.501,02:12:49.670,Better. Definitely better.
02:12:55.676,02:12:58.596,See?
02:13:12.693,02:13:17.323,Want something?
02:13:25.915,02:13:28.083,Excuse us.
02:13:37.969,02:13:39.136,Ahh.
