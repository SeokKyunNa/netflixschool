00:00:41.458,00:00:44.252,- All clean.
00:00:53.012,00:00:55.973,- What are you doing here?
00:00:56.015,00:00:59.601,- What are you talking about?
00:00:59.643,00:01:02.855,"There's only 159 days left till Christmas, so you better be good."
00:01:02.897,00:01:07.067,I'd better be good?
00:01:07.108,00:01:08.861,I don't care about Christmas.
00:01:14.533,00:01:17.202,- Ah!
00:01:17.244,00:01:19.454,- Donkey!
00:01:19.496,00:01:25.126,"Get your green butt in gear and go get your marshmallows, because without marshmallows, sweet potatoes are nothin'!"
00:01:25.168,00:01:29.214,Aggh! Enough! I don't care about any of this nonsense.
00:01:29.256,00:01:33.176,- Now shoo!
00:01:37.932,00:01:39.767,- Ah!
00:01:39.808,00:01:42.185,Ha-ha-ha!
00:01:42.227,00:01:45.064,It's finally here.
00:01:45.146,00:01:49.109,- Trimmed stockin's - or hung your chestnuts or roasted the tree?
00:01:49.150,00:01:51.319,- Or figgified your puddin'?
00:01:51.361,00:01:53.238,Will you get it through your thick head?
00:01:53.280,00:01:56.825,No one here gives a hoot about Christmas!
00:01:56.867,00:01:59.494,A white Christmas!
00:01:59.536,00:02:03.498,And it's our first one together as a family.
00:02:03.540,00:02:06.334,"Uh, oh, yeah!"
00:02:06.376,00:02:08.211,There's somethin' Shrek needs to tell you.
00:02:08.253,00:02:10.631,"Don't ruin the surprise for her, Donkey."
00:02:10.672,00:02:13.550,Surprise?
00:02:13.592,00:02:16.804,"You're the best. Come on, let's go make some cookies."
00:02:18.221,00:02:20.307,"OK, you a dead man."
00:02:20.348,00:02:22.810,"Um, hold that thought."
00:02:43.789,00:02:47.042,"- Oh, good, you're still open."
00:02:47.084,00:02:49.753,"No, no, uh, we're closing now."
00:02:49.795,00:02:52.965,"Wait, wait, wait!"
00:02:49.795,00:02:56.010,"I have to make a Christmas, and I have no idea what it is or how to do it!"
00:02:56.051,00:02:58.219,Why didn't you say so?
00:02:58.261,00:03:00.848,"I know all about Christmas, and I have just the book for you."
00:03:00.889,00:03:04.101,Christmas for Village Idiots.
00:03:04.143,00:03:06.854,One: decorate house.
00:03:06.895,00:03:09.106,Step three: the Christmas feast. Mmmm!
00:03:09.148,00:03:11.984,- What's that?
00:03:12.026,00:03:13.986,The tree goes inside the house?
00:03:15.112,00:03:18.657,"Anyway, step five: The telling of the Christmas story."
00:03:18.699,00:03:23.871,This is the step that says I created the perfect Christmas for my perfect family perfectly.
00:03:21.451,00:03:26.289,"See? Family by the fire, everyone cozy and warm."
00:03:26.331,00:03:28.542,"- Um, sure."
00:03:26.331,00:03:30.585,"- Look, long story short, it's all right here."
00:03:30.627,00:03:32.838,"- Oh, perfect."
00:03:32.880,00:03:34.965,- I didn't get the eggnog!
00:03:35.007,00:03:36.884,- Closed?! What do you mean?
00:03:36.925,00:03:39.344,- Dwight the Knight action figure?
00:03:39.386,00:03:42.389,- Sweet potatoes are nothing without marshmallows!
00:03:42.430,00:03:45.433,- Have a super Christmas.
00:03:46.977,00:03:48.979,- Wha...? Oh.
00:03:51.398,00:03:53.400,"- Honey, is that you?"
00:03:56.111,00:03:58.947,Fiona! What are you doing up so early?
00:03:58.989,00:04:00.866,"- Wait, are you OK?"
00:04:00.908,00:04:03.994,- What are you...?
00:04:04.036,00:04:07.206,"- Uh, I..."
00:04:07.247,00:04:10.042,"Uh, yeah, that. Surprised?"
00:04:10.084,00:04:17.674,"- Well, this is our first Christmas together as a family, and, you know, I just want to make sure that it's perfect."
00:04:17.716,00:04:20.928,"Shrek, I think..."
00:04:20.969,00:04:22.804,- It's passable.
00:04:22.846,00:04:25.015,- Oh! Donkey!
00:04:25.057,00:04:27.976,Whoever did this means business!
00:04:25.057,00:04:33.857,Get rid of all this junk and get some tinsel and doilies and ribbons - and maybe some of those plastic reindeer.
00:04:33.899,00:04:37.194,"Come on, it's Christmas Eve! And I've brought you a little somethin'."
00:04:37.236,00:04:39.821,"Go ahead, take a couple."
00:04:39.863,00:04:42.908,"Oh, isn't that... nice."
00:04:42.950,00:04:49.414,"Well, thanks for stopping by for that brief visit, but as you can see, there's a lot of work to do."
00:04:49.456,00:04:51.416,Just like him to wait till the last minute.
00:04:51.458,00:04:54.128,"Don't worry, if there's one thing I know, it's Christmas."
00:04:54.169,00:04:57.214,"Shrek's gonna want help, my advice, and he's definitely..."
00:04:57.256,00:05:02.552,"Actually, I think what he really wants is a nice family Christmas."
00:05:02.594,00:05:05.931,"Oh, a family Christmas."
00:05:05.973,00:05:08.016,Yeah. It's the first one with the kids.
00:05:08.058,00:05:10.477,Don't say another word.
00:05:10.518,00:05:14.148,"- I got a lot to do now, so I better get movin'."
00:05:14.189,00:05:17.192,"- Uh, and Merry Christmas!"
00:05:22.447,00:05:25.117,Donkey's right.
00:05:25.159,00:05:27.828,How am I ever gonna get this done in time?
00:05:27.869,00:05:32.874,"This is gonna be the best Christmas ever. And we're going to do it together, so come on."
00:05:55.230,00:05:59.526,- Everything looks so good!
00:05:59.567,00:06:01.945,"Oh, nice job, honey."
00:06:01.987,00:06:04.198,"Well, we all did it together."
00:06:04.239,00:06:07.742,And now what would the perfect Christmas be without a Christmas story?
00:06:07.784,00:06:09.577,- Ahem.
00:06:09.619,00:06:17.085,'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house - Not a creature was stirring... What?
00:06:17.127,00:06:19.921,"- Merry Christmas, Shrek!"
00:06:19.963,00:06:22.132,We're here to smother you with Christmas love!
00:06:22.174,00:06:24.926,Absolutely not!
00:06:24.968,00:06:27.221,How are you gonna have Christmas without family?
00:06:27.262,00:06:29.139,- Seasons greeting!
00:06:29.181,00:06:31.432,- Merry Christmas!
00:06:31.474,00:06:34.311,"Oh, yeah. Ooh!"
00:06:35.979,00:06:39.649,"OK, I will assume the position."
00:06:42.569,00:06:47.115,- I am the joy-filled swine!
00:06:47.157,00:06:50.577,Don't you know this is where stockings go?
00:06:50.618,00:06:52.704,Donkey! Don't touch anything.
00:06:52.746,00:06:56.624,- How we gon' roast chestnuts on this little bitty fire?
00:06:56.666,00:06:57.918,"Hey, baby, you mind?"
00:07:01.963,00:07:04.758,"- Oh, boy!"
00:07:08.053,00:07:11.556,Ow! Hey! Ow!
00:07:11.598,00:07:14.726,Did you hurt yourself when you fell out of heaven?
00:07:14.768,00:07:17.396,going to put it?
00:07:17.437,00:07:20.481,"Let's put it over here. No, that is not with the feng shui."
00:07:20.523,00:07:22.442,"Come on, everybody, let's dance!"
00:07:35.663,00:07:39.376,It's me. Shrek?
00:07:39.418,00:07:42.421,- Come back to the party.
00:07:42.462,00:07:44.965,that'd be such a good idea.
00:07:45.006,00:07:48.468,Come on. It's not that bad.
00:07:48.509,00:07:51.471,"OK, I know you're not a party person, but..."
00:07:51.512,00:07:54.891,But what? This is not the kind of Christmas I had in mind.
00:07:54.933,00:07:58.228,"They're our friends, Shrek."
00:07:58.270,00:08:00.688,did Fiona have?
00:08:02.565,00:08:04.109,I better get back to the house.
00:08:04.151,00:08:06.153,I'm surprised we have a house to go back to.
00:08:06.194,00:08:09.489,- Are you coming?
00:08:09.530,00:08:13.452,"- Ah, finally!"
00:08:19.040,00:08:21.126,"- Ja, look at him go!"
00:08:21.168,00:08:24.838,- Excuse me. Excuse me!
00:08:24.879,00:08:28.091,I don't feel very good.
00:08:28.133,00:08:32.637,"- Ahh, I feel better now."
00:08:38.559,00:08:40.645,- Mind if I cut in?
00:08:50.947,00:08:53.241,a little Christmas angel!
00:08:53.283,00:08:56.411,"- Hey there, my sweeties."
00:08:56.453,00:09:00.790,Aw. Would you like Daddy to finish the story for you?
00:09:00.832,00:09:02.417,- Yeah?
00:09:02.459,00:09:08.840,The children were nestled all snug in their beds - Visions of sugarplums...
00:09:06.421,00:09:11.759,- Were you tellin' 'em The Night Before Christmas?
00:09:11.801,00:09:13.720,- And I'm the best teller ever!
00:09:13.761,00:09:15.596,I got it committed to memorization!
00:09:15.638,00:09:17.224,- Gather round!
00:09:17.265,00:09:20.060,I'm supposed to tell the Christmas story.
00:09:20.101,00:10:18.826,"'Twas the night before Christmas and I spent all the day Finishin' up on my Christmas display Now, missin' all this would be nothin' but tragic So just follow me and I'll show you the magic Now, out in the yard in a glorious clutter Is a spectacle there that'll make your heart flutter With 20-foot cheese balls and a big eggnog fountain And yodelin' elves on an ambrosia mountain A stage where acrobats jump, leap and prance And honor the day through interpretive dance - But just when you think the display is complete The Christmas parade comes right down the street With holiday floats all in silver and blue With sugarplum fairies and a reindeer or two There's a baton-twirlin' snowman all happy and perky Magical peacocks and a dancin' roast turkey think that you've just seen it all Comes a huge waffle Santa that's 50 feet tall Ho, ho, ho!"
00:10:18.868,00:10:33.633,With syrup and butter the sight just amazes As it's flanked by a choir all singin' his praises - Donkey.
00:10:33.674,00:10:35.385,- Santa?
00:10:35.427,00:10:36.677,- Donkey!
00:10:36.719,00:10:38.679,- Donkey!
00:10:38.721,00:10:42.016,"Very inappropriate, amigo."
00:10:42.058,00:10:44.603,"- Oh, Puss, not you too."
00:10:42.058,00:10:47.481,"- In my homeland, we tell a very different tale of the Santa Nicholas."
00:10:47.522,00:10:49.857,He's not made of waffles.
00:10:49.899,00:11:12.713,- This Santa was suave He was nothing like that The Santa I know was a hot Latin cat He was dressed all in fur from his head to his paws And he stood there heroic A real Santa... Claws Red are his boots - And so is his cape - Ol√©!
00:11:12.755,00:11:37.364,His sword is a cane that tastes like crab cake He wears a fine belt and a leather cravat And there's a cute fuzzy thing which hangs down from his hat - I have shamed myself.
00:11:37.405,00:11:42.536,"- All right, everybody, if you leave now, you can beat the holiday traffic."
00:11:42.577,00:11:45.413,"Aw, phooey with all your sunshine and lollipops!"
00:11:45.455,00:11:49.000,"Where I come from, Christmas is a nightmare."
00:11:51.545,00:12:00.845,'Twas the night before Christmas and the prettiest sights Were my sweetheart beside me in the bright Christmas lights ...until they got home.
00:12:00.887,00:12:05.099,"When they looked at the car door handle, and they found a hook!"
00:12:07.018,00:12:09.979,"Gingy, cut it out! You're really givin' me the creeps!"
00:12:10.021,00:12:12.982,"Oh, come on, I was just teasin'."
00:12:13.024,00:12:15.652,"- Come here, you."
00:12:15.694,00:12:17.987,I couldn't stay mad at you.
00:12:18.029,00:12:19.780,- What was that?
00:12:19.822,00:12:22.492,"Oh, no, you don't. I'm not fallin' for that again."
00:12:22.534,00:12:25.995,"No, I'm really, really seriously not kidding."
00:12:27.455,00:12:29.290,- Whoa!
00:12:29.332,00:12:32.168,- Oh!
00:12:34.921,00:12:39.467,- Oh! Suzie!
00:12:39.509,00:12:42.596,- No! No! No!
00:12:42.637,00:12:44.639,That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
00:12:44.681,00:12:47.308,- You know that's not how it goes.
00:12:47.350,00:12:50.645,"All right, everyone, I've had just about enough!"
00:12:50.687,00:12:54.899,All I wanted was a nice Christmas with my family.
00:12:54.941,00:12:59.404,"And that's exactly why we're all here! Now, come on, let's finish tellin' my story."
00:12:59.446,00:13:04.618,"Oh, no, Donkey, that's not what I meant."
00:13:04.659,00:13:07.828,"- Oh, hey, what's this?"
00:13:07.870,00:13:12.375,- Why are you whisperin'?
00:13:17.088,00:13:18.172,- Heimlich!
00:13:18.214,00:13:19.840,"- No, Heimlich!"
00:13:19.882,00:13:22.385,- Uh!
00:13:22.427,00:13:25.138,Whoa! Ah!
00:13:25.179,00:13:28.015,- Ow! My eye!
00:13:28.057,00:13:29.684,- Ow!
00:13:29.726,00:13:30.893,- Oh!
00:13:35.898,00:13:39.360,- Ah!
00:13:39.402,00:13:41.738,- Somebody get some water!
00:13:41.780,00:13:44.449,"Don't worry, Shrek, everything is under control!"
00:13:44.491,00:13:48.035,"- Oh, boy."
00:13:49.203,00:13:51.372,- Ooh! The tea is ready.
00:13:51.414,00:13:56.835,- I want everybody out of my house right now!
00:13:56.877,00:13:59.172,Ah! Ow!
00:13:59.213,00:14:02.676,"Yeah, well, that's a real nice way to treat your guests on Christmas!"
00:14:02.717,00:14:07.972,"And if you think I'm gonna give you a present now, you are sadly mistaken!"
00:14:08.014,00:14:10.725,You want to give me a present?
00:14:10.767,00:14:13.645,- That's all I wanted!
00:14:13.687,00:14:18.941,"- Good, then go!"
00:14:13.687,00:14:23.029,"- You go and have yourself a merry Christmas, - Ebenezer Shrek!"
00:14:26.700,00:14:30.537,- We could come to our house.
00:14:30.578,00:14:32.955,Now maybe we can...
00:14:33.998,00:14:37.460,Fiona? Where you going?
00:14:37.502,00:14:41.339,"Shrek, you just kicked everybody out on Christmas."
00:14:41.381,00:14:43.842,"Well, that wasn't Christmas."
00:14:43.883,00:14:46.927,"Look, I know it didn't go like you wanted."
00:14:46.969,00:14:50.849,What I wanted was a perfect Christmas for me and my family.
00:14:50.890,00:14:53.601,- That was our family.
00:14:53.643,00:14:55.478,That was a natural disaster!
00:14:55.520,00:14:58.523,"On Christmas, that's how it works. Yes, it was crowded."
00:14:58.565,00:15:00.817,"Yes, it got a little out of hand."
00:15:00.859,00:15:04.571,"- Fiona, they lit me on fire!"
00:15:04.612,00:15:09.534,I had everything under control until they showed up and ruined my Christmas!
00:15:09.576,00:15:12.328,- Your Christmas?
00:15:12.370,00:15:14.997,"- For you, and the babies."
00:15:15.039,00:15:21.254,Christmas is not just about you or me. Or even the babies.
00:15:21.295,00:15:23.631,You just don't get it.
00:15:23.673,00:15:28.928,I have to go. I need to apologize to our friends.
00:15:28.969,00:15:30.597,"Fiona, wait."
00:16:19.228,00:16:22.440,I still don't understand why Shrek had to be so mean and cranky.
00:16:22.482,00:16:24.317,We were tryin' to do what you wanted us to do!
00:16:24.358,00:16:27.111,- What are you talking about?
00:16:27.153,00:16:30.490,"You know, you and Shrek wanted to have a big old noisy family Christmas."
00:16:30.531,00:16:33.075,"No, I said it was our first Christmas together as a family."
00:16:33.117,00:16:35.202,"A family, right."
00:16:35.244,00:16:37.204,Then he lost his temper like that.
00:16:37.246,00:16:40.625,"You know, Donkey, none of us really asked Shrek what he wanted."
00:16:40.667,00:16:44.629,"Well, I must agree with the Princess. And you, especially, were no Christmas angel."
00:16:44.671,00:16:47.715,"- You know, I don't remember askin' you anything!"
00:16:47.757,00:16:50.384,You're right.
00:16:50.426,00:16:53.220,"- Even still, Shrek didn't have to be so..."
00:16:54.430,00:16:57.057,Pigheaded? Stubborn? Mean?
00:16:57.099,00:17:02.313,"Well, maybe I am all those things, but I'm an ogre, OK?"
00:17:02.355,00:17:04.899,So here's the thing.
00:17:04.941,00:17:08.945,I'm sorry you took getting kicked out of my house the wrong way.
00:17:08.987,00:17:12.615,"No, wait."
00:17:08.987,00:17:16.828,What I meant to say is I know you're all just trying to be helpful in your own irritating fashion...
00:17:16.870,00:17:21.374,"- Ay, caramba!"
00:17:21.415,00:17:24.377,- Shrek!
00:17:21.415,00:17:26.713,"- Look, I shouldn't have lost my temper back there."
00:17:26.754,00:17:29.382,- Apology accepted. Let's eat.
00:17:29.423,00:17:33.260,"Now, there's somethin' more to this. Come on now, what's goin' on?"
00:17:33.302,00:17:41.644,"Look, all I wanted was to make this perfect for my family, but I don't even know what Christmas means."
00:17:41.686,00:17:44.939,"The thing is, this is my first Christmas too."
00:17:46.607,00:17:49.694,"Whoa, hold up, Shrek! You mean to tell me that you never had..."
00:17:49.736,00:17:50.862,- No.
00:17:50.904,00:17:52.238,- No!
00:17:50.904,00:17:53.990,"- You mean no chestnuts, no Santa, no presents, no stockings?"
00:17:54.032,00:17:56.868,- Donkey!
00:17:56.910,00:18:00.287,"No, none of that."
00:18:00.329,00:18:04.083,Ogres don't celebrate Christmas.
00:18:04.124,00:18:07.211,Ogres don't celebrate anything.
00:18:08.922,00:18:12.383,"Oh, man, now I'm all emotional."
00:18:12.425,00:18:15.803,"- Come here, Shrek, gimme a hug!"
00:18:15.845,00:18:18.431,"OK, all right, I just..."
00:18:15.845,00:18:24.478,guess I got... a little excited about Christmas and all the presents and mistletoe and I forgot that it's...
00:18:24.520,00:18:28.441,"It's about us all bein' together, and I'm..."
00:18:28.482,00:18:32.987,"I know, Donkey, and..."
00:18:33.029,00:18:35.114,"Oh, Christmas is all about big fights."
00:18:35.155,00:18:37.992,"My mama used to say, Christmas ain't Christmas till somebody cries."
00:18:38.034,00:18:40.286,- Usually that someone's me.
00:18:38.034,00:18:44.707,"- Boss, - there is no right way to do Christmas. You just do it."
00:18:46.709,00:18:51.047,- And family.
00:18:51.089,00:18:55.259,So despite the fact that you drive me crazy at times...
00:18:55.301,00:18:58.096,"Yes, Donkey, I'm lookin' at you."
00:18:58.137,00:19:02.683,...it would mean a lot to me if you'd all come back and join us.
00:19:04.393,00:19:07.438,I guess I deserved that.
00:19:07.480,00:19:09.816,- Don't push your luck.
00:19:09.857,00:19:12.318,"They got you good, Shrek!"
00:19:12.359,00:19:14.278,That wasn't even funny!
00:19:17.573,00:19:20.118,of the spare blankets.
00:19:22.328,00:19:26.373,"Uh, sorry, but this is my spot."
00:19:28.459,00:19:31.004,"So we are pigs, pigs in the blanket, ja?"
00:19:31.045,00:19:32.421,- Ja.
00:19:32.463,00:19:35.049,"- So this is funny then, ja?"
00:19:35.091,00:19:36.634,- This is funny.
00:19:36.676,00:19:39.053,"- Yep, that's a good one."
00:19:39.095,00:19:42.515,- It's time for lights out.
00:19:42.556,00:19:45.143,"We haven't heard a bedtime story. Right, everybody?"
00:19:45.184,00:19:47.895,"- Shrek, yeah!"
00:19:47.937,00:19:50.773,All right. All right.
00:19:54.110,00:19:56.403,OK.
00:19:56.445,00:20:17.633,"'Twas the night before Christmas Not a swamp rat did creep As mother and babe played kazoo in their sleep Now, the sight of the house would make any ogre droop For 'twas sickeningly sweet as unicorn poop Yet who was arriving to help this lost cause?"
00:20:17.675,00:20:23.806,"The foul, the vile and handsome Ogre Claus Hey. How's it goin'?"
00:20:23.848,00:20:28.728,He looked all around and scratched at his beard And said...
00:20:28.769,00:20:30.980,And said...
00:20:31.022,00:20:34.984,"This place is worse than I thought... uh, feared."
00:20:35.026,00:20:41.741,So he grabbed up his belly and screwed up his face - And let loose a...
00:20:41.782,00:21:00.051,That transformed the place With a gleam in his eye His work here was done And then to the babies he gave One by one A festering bottle of stinky swamp juice And for mommy a kiss and a good Christmas goose - Ooh!
00:21:00.093,00:21:21.488,"Then digging a finger inside of his nose And giving a nod Up the chimney he rose And I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight Smelly Christmas to all, and to all a gross night - Ho, ho, ho!"
00:21:21.530,00:21:24.033,"Ho, ho, ho!"
00:21:24.075,00:21:27.828,"- Ho, ho, ho!"
00:21:27.870,00:21:31.082,"Ho, ho, ho!"
