00:01:03.542,00:01:05.375,- Shaun.
00:01:05.417,00:01:07.000,Do you see what I'm saying?
00:01:07.041,00:01:10.000,"Yeah, totally."
00:01:10.041,00:01:12.166,"I know he's your best friend, but you do live with him."
00:01:12.208,00:01:13.625,I know.
00:01:13.667,00:01:15.417,It's not that I don't like Ed.
00:01:15.458,00:01:18.125,"Ed, it's not that I don't like you."
00:01:18.166,00:01:20.500,It's all right.
00:01:20.542,00:01:23.709,- It'd just be nice if we could...
00:01:23.750,00:01:26.750,- spend a bit more time together...
00:01:26.792,00:01:29.500,- just the two of us.
00:01:29.542,00:01:34.875,"It's just with Ed here, it's no wonder I always bring my flat mates out and then that only exacerbates things."
00:01:34.917,00:01:36.667,What do you mean?
00:01:36.709,00:01:39.333,"Well, you guys hardly get on, do you?"
00:01:39.375,00:01:41.208,"No, what does exacerbate mean?"
00:01:41.250,00:01:43.709,"It means, um, to make things worse."
00:01:43.750,00:01:45.291,"Right, right."
00:01:45.333,00:01:49.333,"Well, I mean, it's not that I don't like David and Di, you know."
00:01:49.375,00:01:50.834,"Guys, it's not that I don't like you."
00:01:50.875,00:01:52.625,Both: It's all right.
00:01:52.667,00:01:56.083,"And it's not that I don't want to spend time with you, 'cause I do."
00:01:56.125,00:01:58.709,It's just Ed doesn't have too many friends.
00:01:58.750,00:02:01.750,Can I get any of you cunts a drink?
00:02:04.792,00:02:06.417,Anybody?
00:02:06.458,00:02:08.875,"Both: No, thank you."
00:02:08.917,00:02:17.041,"I know friends are important to Shaun, but you do actually have to set some quality time aside for yourselves."
00:02:17.083,00:02:23.417,"Yeah, I mean, Daffs is always taking me to see these listed buildings and I'm always dragging him to the theater."
00:02:23.458,00:02:26.083,- I'm not so hot on theater.
00:02:26.125,00:02:28.333,- It's your anniversary soon isn't it?
00:02:28.375,00:02:30.792,"Oh, did you do anything special?"
00:02:30.834,00:02:32.125,We came here.
00:02:32.166,00:02:34.208,Ed: Shaun! Hog lumps.
00:02:34.250,00:02:40.834,"Shaun, what I'm trying to say is I need something a little more, more than spending every night in the Winchester."
00:02:40.875,00:02:42.875,I want to get out there and do more interesting stuff.
00:02:42.917,00:02:44.291,I want to live a little.
00:02:44.333,00:02:46.834,I want you to want to want to do it too.
00:02:48.458,00:02:49.792,Listen to me.
00:02:49.834,00:02:52.834,"I'm beginning to sound like your mum, not that I'd know what she sounds like."
00:02:52.875,00:02:54.875,You still haven't met his mum?
00:02:54.917,00:02:58.000,- Not yet.
00:02:58.041,00:03:00.834,"It's not that I don't get on with her-- Are you ashamed by your mum, Shaun?"
00:03:00.875,00:03:03.458,"- No, I love my mum."
00:03:03.500,00:03:05.125,- Ed!
00:03:05.166,00:03:06.792,- Ed!
00:03:05.166,00:03:12.500,"- Both: Shaun-- - Guys-- - Shaun-- Liz, look, I understand what you're trying to say, okay, and I agree."
00:03:12.542,00:03:15.000,We should get out there.
00:03:15.041,00:03:20.333,"I'll book a restaurant, you know the place that does all the fish, just the two of us."
00:03:20.375,00:03:23.625,"Things will change, I promise."
00:03:23.667,00:03:26.000,"Really, Shaun?"
00:03:26.041,00:03:28.291,"- Man: Time, gentlemen."
00:03:30.542,00:03:32.667,Liz: Shaun?
00:04:39.583,00:04:42.417,Man: Player two has entered the game.
00:04:42.458,00:04:44.166,Haven't you got work?
00:04:44.208,00:04:46.208,Player two has left the game.
00:04:59.458,00:05:02.000,You do know the front door was open again last night.
00:05:06.166,00:05:08.792,- I'm not saying it was you.
00:05:08.834,00:05:11.625,- I'm saying it was Ed.
00:05:11.667,00:05:13.792,I can't live like this.
00:05:13.834,00:05:16.458,"I mean, just look at the state of it."
00:05:16.500,00:05:18.125,- We're not students anymore.
00:05:16.500,00:05:22.000,"- Pete-- I mean, it's not like he even brings any real money - into the house."
00:05:22.041,00:05:23.750,"What, dealing drugs?"
00:05:23.792,00:05:26.125,"He sells a bit of weed every now and again, you know?"
00:05:26.166,00:05:27.375,You've sold puff.
00:05:27.417,00:05:30.166,"Yeah, once, at college, to you."
00:05:30.208,00:05:32.750,"Well, look, I've known him since primary school."
00:05:32.792,00:05:35.125,"You know, I like having him around, he's a laugh."
00:05:35.166,00:05:37.041,What? Because he can impersonate an orangutan?
00:05:37.083,00:05:39.959,- Fuck-a-doodle-doo.
00:05:40.000,00:05:48.750,"All right, I admit, he can be pretty funny on occasion, like that time we stayed up all night drinking apple schnapps - and playing Tekken 2."
00:05:48.792,00:05:50.792,- When was that?
00:05:50.834,00:05:53.542,That was five years ago.
00:05:53.583,00:05:54.792,When's he going home?
00:05:56.458,00:05:58.291,"Hey, man, listen, um, oh, top left."
00:05:58.333,00:06:00.208,- Ed: Uh-huh.
00:06:00.250,00:06:01.792,- Reload.
00:06:01.834,00:06:04.375,"Um, since-- oh, nice shot!"
00:06:04.417,00:06:06.000,- Thanks.
00:06:06.041,00:06:08.583,Two seconds.
00:06:08.625,00:06:10.417,"You all right, Noodle?"
00:06:10.458,00:06:12.125,"Man: Hello, mate, got anything?"
00:06:12.166,00:06:14.000,"- No, man."
00:06:14.041,00:06:15.917,- I ain't got nothing.
00:06:15.959,00:06:17.208,You ain't got nothing at all?
00:06:17.250,00:06:18.417,Ed: I've only got an Henry meself.
00:06:18.458,00:06:22.000,"All right, later."
00:06:22.041,00:06:24.000,- Listen-- - Ed.
00:06:24.041,00:06:29.291,"Since you're not working at the moment, - could you please clean up a bit?"
00:06:29.333,00:06:33.500,"And if you play the answer machine, could you take down everyone's messages, not just your own?"
00:06:33.542,00:06:36.291,- Yep.
00:06:33.542,00:06:38.792,"- It's not that taxing, is it, writing something on a little scrap of paper?"
00:06:38.834,00:06:42.000,- Nope.
00:06:45.083,00:06:46.166,"Pete: Dom, hi."
00:06:46.208,00:06:49.125,"Come on, it was pretty funny."
00:06:49.166,00:06:51.792,- Will you do what he said?
00:06:51.834,00:06:53.625,"Well, do it for me, then."
00:06:56.208,00:06:57.667,"I'm sorry, Shaun."
00:06:57.709,00:07:00.083,It's all right.
00:07:00.125,00:07:02.583,"No, no, I'm sorry, Shaun."
00:07:05.875,00:07:07.375,Oh!
00:07:07.417,00:07:09.041,"Oh, my God, that's rotten!"
00:07:09.083,00:07:11.125,I'll stop doing 'em when you stop laughing.
00:07:11.166,00:07:13.041,- I am not laughing.
00:07:13.083,00:07:14.959,- Get that.
00:07:17.875,00:07:19.291,"Liz: Hello, Shaun, it's me."
00:07:19.333,00:07:24.041,"Look, I'm gonna be a bit tied up today, so when you book the table, can you make it 8:00 rather than 7:00?"
00:07:24.083,00:07:26.291,I'll try you at work.
00:07:30.000,00:07:31.208,Hey!
00:07:31.250,00:07:32.500,You're dead.
00:07:40.333,00:07:42.250,"Spare some change, please, mister?"
00:07:42.291,00:07:43.625,"Uh, yeah."
00:07:47.166,00:07:48.750,Are you blind?
00:08:00.041,00:08:10.166,Man on TV: The American deep space probe Omega 6 due to return to Earth this weekend unexpectedly re-entered Earth's atmosphere over Southeast England and has broken apart over what's believed to be a populated area.
00:08:25.417,00:08:26.542,Nelson?
00:08:29.375,00:08:30.375,Nelson?
00:08:33.750,00:08:35.959,"Hello, my friend."
00:08:36.000,00:08:37.750,"No, it's a bit early for me."
00:08:49.166,00:08:52.917,"Shaun: Gather round, everyone."
00:08:52.959,00:08:54.583,"Uh, gather round."
00:08:54.625,00:09:05.125,"Now as well as Mr. Sloman being off today, I'm afraid Ash is feeling a little bit under the weather, so I will be taking charge as the-- Oldest."
00:09:05.166,00:09:06.959,Senior staff member.
00:09:07.000,00:09:08.667,So if we can all just pull together.
00:09:08.709,00:09:13.917,"- I know that-- - Hello? Hello, mate."
00:09:13.959,00:09:16.792,I was totally munted last night.
00:09:16.834,00:09:21.000,"Yeah, I spoke to him."
00:09:21.041,00:09:23.333,"All right, mate, laters."
00:09:31.458,00:09:34.125,- Continue.
00:09:34.166,00:09:40.542,"Um, as Mr. Sloman always says, there's no I in team, but there is an I in pie."
00:09:40.583,00:09:42.208,In-- there's an I in meat pie.
00:09:42.250,00:09:45.417,The anagram of meat is team-- I don't know what he's talking about.
00:09:45.458,00:09:47.291,"Look, that's it."
00:09:47.333,00:09:48.709,It's not a social gathering.
00:09:48.750,00:09:50.375,"All right, keep your hair on, granddad."
00:09:50.417,00:09:52.834,"Hey, hey, whoa, I'm 29 for Christ sakes."
00:09:52.875,00:09:55.291,How old are you?
00:09:55.333,00:09:56.542,17.
00:09:56.583,00:09:59.166,"Hey, well..."
00:09:59.208,00:10:01.000,I know you don't want to be here forever.
00:10:01.041,00:10:02.875,I got things I want to do with my life.
00:10:02.917,00:10:04.291,When?
00:10:06.500,00:10:07.875,You got red on you.
00:10:10.041,00:10:12.375,"Noel: Hello, mate."
00:10:12.417,00:10:15.625,This one comes with a basic sort of digital package.
00:10:15.667,00:10:19.792,"You've got your lifestyle channels there, a bit of Trisha."
00:10:19.834,00:10:24.125,"Uh, you've got entertainment."
00:10:24.166,00:10:28.583,"News-- all the basic, uh, news... channels."
00:10:28.625,00:10:30.333,Man on TV: The bizarre events...

00:10:36.750,00:10:38.250,It's your dad.
00:10:38.291,00:10:40.917,He's not my dad.
00:10:40.959,00:10:42.000,He's my stepdad.
00:10:45.333,00:10:46.917,Philip.
00:10:49.291,00:10:50.583,Shaun.
00:10:52.709,00:10:55.750,I trust you haven't forgotten about tomorrow.
00:10:55.792,00:10:57.917,- No.
00:10:57.959,00:10:59.417,"No, I haven't forgotten."
00:10:59.458,00:11:03.458,Perhaps you could bring the flowers you forgot to bring Barbara on Mother's Day.
00:11:03.500,00:11:04.875,I was gonna.
00:11:04.917,00:11:08.000,And not a cheap posy from a garage forecourt.
00:11:08.041,00:11:09.125,I wasn't gonna.
00:11:12.500,00:11:14.875,"Well, we look forward to seeing you tomorrow, then."
00:11:14.917,00:11:16.917,Okay.
00:11:16.959,00:11:18.375,You've got red on you.
00:11:26.792,00:11:28.792,I thought you said this wasn't a social gathering?
00:11:28.834,00:11:30.333,What?
00:11:30.375,00:11:32.583,How comes you're allowed to speak to your dad?
00:11:32.625,00:11:35.917,"A, he's not my dad, okay?"
00:11:35.959,00:11:38.750,"And B, it was an emergency."
00:11:38.792,00:11:41.709,"What, like buying your mum some flowers?"
00:11:41.750,00:11:47.458,"Noel, no matter what you might think, okay, I do not find it difficult to keep my work and my social life separate."
00:11:47.500,00:11:49.291,"Shaun, it's Liz for you."
00:11:53.375,00:11:55.709,- Hello.

00:12:21.458,00:12:24.625,"Sorry, um, they're for my mum."
00:12:24.667,00:12:29.792,"To a wonderful mum or Pow, super mum?"
00:12:29.834,00:12:31.792,"- Uh, the first one."
00:12:48.917,00:12:51.208,Man on TV: London seems to have gone completely bonkers...
00:13:08.625,00:13:11.542,"Man: Come on, get a fucking move on!"

00:13:33.959,00:13:36.834,That's great.
00:13:36.875,00:13:38.583,How long's that been now?
00:13:38.625,00:13:40.834,"Uh, it's three years ago last week, actually."
00:13:40.875,00:13:43.250,"Oh, did you do anything special?"
00:13:43.291,00:13:45.041,"We're going out for a meal tonight, actually."
00:13:45.083,00:13:47.959,"Oh, anywhere nice?"

00:14:03.417,00:14:05.291,"Well, it doesn't look that tidy."
00:14:05.333,00:14:07.125,"Well, I had a few beers when I finished."
00:14:07.166,00:14:09.959,"Man: Hello, Fulci's."
00:14:10.000,00:14:12.250,- Do you want your messages?
00:14:12.291,00:14:17.542,"Well, your mum rang about going round tomorrow night, and then Liz rang about the two of you eating out tonight."
00:14:17.583,00:14:20.041,Then your mum rang back to see if I wanted to eat her out tonight.
00:14:20.083,00:14:21.792,- What?
00:14:21.834,00:14:29.333,"Yeah, hi, I know this is really short notice and everything, but could you possibly do me a table for two for tonight at about 8:00?"
00:14:29.375,00:14:31.667,"Man: Sorry, we just gave away the last table."
00:14:37.417,00:14:38.834,Wasn't true about your mum.
00:14:38.875,00:14:40.917,What am I gonna do?
00:14:40.959,00:14:43.792,- The Winchester.
00:14:43.834,00:14:45.458,There's a Breville out back.
00:14:45.500,00:14:47.375,"- Ed, this is serious."
00:14:47.417,00:14:48.750,Hello.
00:14:48.792,00:14:50.417,"- Liz: Hello, it's me."
00:14:50.458,00:14:52.625,"So what's the plan, then?"
00:14:52.667,00:14:57.500,"Um... yeah, there's been a bit of a mix-up with the table, babe."
00:14:57.542,00:15:00.959,- What do you mean?
00:15:01.000,00:15:04.041,But I thought you said it was all okay?
00:15:04.083,00:15:06.041,Yeah.
00:15:06.083,00:15:08.000,"You didn't book it, did you, Shaun?"
00:15:08.041,00:15:09.500,No.
00:15:09.542,00:15:12.000,So...
00:15:16.792,00:15:18.667,The Winchester?
00:15:23.792,00:15:26.041,- Dianne: Hello?
00:15:26.083,00:15:28.917,"- I'm not sure this is the best time, Shaun."
00:15:28.959,00:15:31.208,"David: Lizzie doesn't want to see you, Shaun."
00:15:31.250,00:15:32.959,- Go away.
00:15:33.000,00:15:35.500,"to see you, Shaun."
00:15:35.542,00:15:36.875,What do you want me to do?
00:15:36.917,00:15:40.166,"Do you want me to climb up the wall, come through the window?"
00:15:40.208,00:15:42.834,- 'Cause I will.
00:15:42.875,00:15:45.709,"- All right, see you in a minute."
00:15:57.375,00:15:59.792,"- Shaun: Hi, it's me again."
00:15:59.834,00:16:02.709,"Liz, Can we just talk about this, you know, go out?"
00:16:02.750,00:16:04.792,"- What, to the Winchester?"
00:16:04.834,00:16:06.250,"Liz: No, I don't fucking want to!"
00:16:06.291,00:16:09.750,"Shaun: Okay, I just thought-- It's not the only place in the world, Shaun."
00:16:09.792,00:16:11.709,We could go to the Shepherd's then.
00:16:11.750,00:16:13.083,They do Thai in there now.
00:16:13.125,00:16:14.542,I'm going out with David and Di.
00:16:14.583,00:16:16.000,"Shaun: Well, let's all go together."
00:16:16.041,00:16:17.583,"Liz: What, you hang out with my friends?"
00:16:17.625,00:16:19.083,"Sorry, a failed actress and a twat?"
00:16:19.125,00:16:20.667,- That's harsh.
00:16:20.709,00:16:23.709,I did not call Dianne a failed actress.
00:16:23.750,00:16:26.417,Let's just go somewhere and have a laugh.
00:16:26.458,00:16:27.959,"Things will be fine, I promise."
00:16:28.000,00:16:29.875,You promised you'd stop smoking when I did.
00:16:29.917,00:16:31.583,You promised you'd go back to the gym.
00:16:31.625,00:16:33.875,You promised you'd try drinking red wine instead of beer!
00:16:33.917,00:16:35.625,You promised you'd come on holiday with me.
00:16:35.667,00:16:38.291,"- We went to Greece, didn't we!"
00:16:38.333,00:16:40.959,- At a rave.
00:16:41.000,00:16:42.834,You promised things would change.
00:16:42.875,00:16:44.125,You promised you'd get us free cable.
00:16:44.166,00:16:45.792,- I'm working on that.
00:16:45.834,00:16:47.917,I can give up smoking.
00:16:47.959,00:16:49.250,"Look, see?"
00:16:50.834,00:16:52.667,W-what was the next one?
00:16:52.709,00:16:54.709,"It's not enough, Shaun."
00:17:00.750,00:17:05.250,"Man on TV: If you are concerned that someone you know may-- Basically, I'd say your nine lives were up, Shaun."
00:17:05.291,00:17:07.208,"Get fucked, four-eyes!"
00:17:07.250,00:17:09.750,"Why don't you go out with her, you love her so much?"
00:17:09.792,00:17:10.875,What do you mean by that?
00:17:17.208,00:17:19.250,I don't know what he meant by that.
00:17:23.542,00:17:25.000,Got you these.
00:17:32.250,00:17:33.375,To a wonderful mum?
00:17:33.417,00:17:35.000,"Oh, ooh."
00:17:35.041,00:17:39.041,"Yeah, yeah, that's because..."
00:17:39.083,00:17:44.709,"I thought it would be funny because of what you said last night about me, you know, don't want to be my mum and that."
00:17:44.750,00:17:46.083,It's just a little joke.
00:17:46.125,00:17:49.166,It's just sort of spur of the moment.
00:17:49.208,00:17:51.709,"They're for your mum, aren't they?"
00:17:51.750,00:17:53.000,Yeah.
00:17:53.041,00:17:54.417,Smooth.
00:18:03.041,00:18:10.709,"Look, if I don't do something, I'm gonna end up in that pub every night for the rest of my life like those other sad old fuckers drinking myself to death wondering what the hell happened."
00:18:13.250,00:18:14.625,"What do you mean, do something?"
00:18:48.834,00:18:50.750,Fuck her.
00:18:50.792,00:18:52.333,You got your pint.
00:18:52.375,00:18:54.709,You got your pig snacks.
00:18:56.792,00:19:00.667,Oh. You want your favorite monkey?
00:19:00.709,00:19:02.250,Shall I do Clyde?
00:19:14.917,00:19:16.583,"See, I knew you'd get over her."
00:19:28.792,00:19:30.750,Who the hell put this on?
00:19:30.792,00:19:33.208,It's on random.
00:19:33.250,00:19:36.250,For fuck's sake!
00:19:40.667,00:19:42.625,You know what we should do tomorrow?
00:19:42.667,00:19:43.875,Keep drinking.
00:19:43.917,00:19:52.834,"We'll have a Bloody Mary first thing, a bite at the King's Head, couple at The Little Princess, stagger back here and bang, back at the bar for shots."
00:19:52.875,00:19:54.417,How's that for a slice of fried gold?
00:19:54.458,00:19:56.667,- No.
00:19:59.375,00:20:01.166,Talk to me.
00:20:01.208,00:20:10.291,"She said if she stayed with me she'd end up coming in here every night for the rest of her life like these sad old fuckers drinking herself to death, wondering what the hell happened."
00:20:10.333,00:20:11.834,That is harsh.
00:20:11.875,00:20:14.291,"These are rich, interesting characters."
00:20:14.333,00:20:15.542,Like who?
00:20:18.959,00:20:22.667,Snakehips-- always surrounded by women.
00:20:22.709,00:20:31.041,"He's a bigamist, Strangled his first wife with a draft excluder and invented the mobile disco."
00:20:31.083,00:20:33.834,"What about her, then?"
00:20:33.875,00:20:36.000,Ooh!
00:20:37.875,00:20:40.083,She's an ex-porn star.
00:20:40.125,00:20:44.417,They say she starred in the world's first interracial hardcore loop.
00:20:44.458,00:20:45.875,Cafe au lait.
00:20:47.333,00:20:48.333,Pour vous.
00:20:50.709,00:20:53.959,"Yeah, what about John, then?"
00:20:54.000,00:20:55.709,- He's North London Mafia.
00:20:55.750,00:20:58.458,It's true.
00:20:58.500,00:21:01.917,"Yeah, well, Big Al also says dogs can't look up."
00:21:01.959,00:21:05.500,Think about it-- Handy with a blade.
00:21:05.542,00:21:08.625,"Bernie, the trophy wife."
00:21:08.667,00:21:10.542,Why do you think there's a rifle above the bar?
00:21:10.583,00:21:12.208,Shaun: 'Cause the pub's called the Winchester.
00:21:12.250,00:21:14.375,- Exactly.
00:21:14.417,00:21:17.083,"See, you don't need Liz to have a good time."
00:21:17.125,00:21:20.041,"- Oh, don't, man."
00:21:20.083,00:21:22.959,"Oy, look at me."
00:21:23.000,00:21:36.250,"I'm not gonna say there's plenty more fish in the sea, I'm not gonna say if you love her, let her go, and I'm not gonna bombard you with clichés, but what I will say is this-- it's not the end of the world."
00:21:42.250,00:21:44.583,"Sorry, we're closed."
00:21:46.750,00:21:49.959,Pisshead.
00:21:50.000,00:21:51.959,- Bass.
00:21:53.250,00:22:06.625,"Both: What's the matter, love, haven't you had your tea?"
00:22:17.750,00:22:19.083,- Shh!
00:22:19.125,00:22:21.625,- Blow!
00:22:27.667,00:22:32.000,- Ah!
00:22:38.500,00:22:40.166,What's he doing?
00:22:40.208,00:22:42.333,Or freeze.
00:22:42.375,00:22:44.542,What a tit.
00:23:03.166,00:23:05.208,Don't scratch it!
00:23:03.166,00:23:09.291,Wait-- That was the second album I ever bought!
00:23:09.333,00:23:11.542,It's 4:00 in the fucking morning!
00:23:11.583,00:23:13.000,- It's Saturday!
00:23:13.041,00:23:20.291,It's fucking Sunday and I've got to go to fucking work in four fucking hours because every other fucker in my fucking department is fucking ill!
00:23:20.333,00:23:23.375,Then can you see why I'm so fucking angry?
00:23:23.417,00:23:27.083,"- Fuck, yeah!"
00:23:23.417,00:23:29.542,"- Hey! Pete, look, you know, I'm sorry, we've had a couple of drinks."
00:23:29.583,00:23:33.750,We split up with Liz tonight.
00:23:33.792,00:23:34.959,"-Just keep it down, -yeah?"
00:23:36.875,00:23:39.291,Prick.
00:23:39.333,00:23:40.291,What was that?
00:23:40.333,00:23:42.000,Nothing.
00:23:42.041,00:23:43.917,"Oh, no, no, no, come on, stop it, we're friends!"
00:23:43.959,00:23:45.875,He's not my friend!
00:23:45.917,00:23:47.208,What's that supposed to mean?
00:23:47.250,00:23:49.291,It means why don't you fuck off?!
00:23:49.333,00:23:53.041,"You want to live like an animal, go live in the shed, you thick fuck!"
00:23:53.083,00:23:56.000,"- Oh, leave him alone!"
00:23:56.041,00:23:58.208,All he ever does is hold you back.
00:23:58.250,00:24:02.792,Or does it make your life easier having someone around who's more of a loser than you are?
00:24:02.834,00:24:04.250,What's that supposed to mean?
00:24:04.291,00:24:06.125,You know what I mean.
00:24:06.166,00:24:09.542,I assume it was Liz who did the dumping?
00:24:09.583,00:24:13.000,"Sort your fucking life out, mate."
00:24:13.041,00:24:16.166,"What's up with your hand, man?"
00:24:16.208,00:24:18.250,I got mugged on the way home from work.
00:24:18.291,00:24:20.542,- By who?
00:24:20.583,00:24:22.417,- One of them bit me.
00:24:22.458,00:24:25.709,I don't know.
00:24:25.750,00:24:31.041,Now I've got a splitting headache and your stupid hip-hop isn't helping.
00:24:31.083,00:24:33.375,And the front door is open again!
00:24:35.166,00:24:39.250,"It's not hip-hop, it's electro. Prick."
00:24:39.291,00:24:41.750,"Next time I see him, he's dead."
00:24:52.667,00:24:54.625,"- Liz: Hello, Shaun, it's me."
00:24:54.667,00:24:59.625,"Look, I'm gonna be a bit tied up today so when you book the table, can you make it 8:00 rather than 7:00?"
00:24:59.667,00:25:01.959,I'll try you at work.
00:25:03.333,00:25:06.125,"Hello, pickle."
00:25:06.166,00:25:10.959,Dad said he saw you in town today and mentioned you might be visiting tomorrow which would be lovely.
00:25:11.000,00:25:13.625,Will you be bringing Elizabeth with you this time?
00:25:13.667,00:25:21.125,"Only we can't wait to meet her finally and also, um... I was wondering if she wanted anything special for lunch?"
00:25:21.166,00:25:23.458,'Cause these days a lot of people don't eat meat.
00:25:39.166,00:25:41.667,Do you want anything from the shop?
00:25:41.709,00:25:43.250,Cornetto.
00:26:52.041,00:26:55.875,"Nelson, have you got any papers?"
00:26:55.917,00:26:58.917,Nelson?
00:26:55.917,00:27:00.583,I haven't even-- I owe you about 15 p.
00:27:34.125,00:27:35.333,"Oh, dear."
00:27:38.125,00:27:40.125,"Sorry, I haven't got any change."
00:27:40.166,00:27:43.083,I didn't even have enough at the fucking shop.
00:27:43.125,00:27:44.166,"Oh, dear."
00:27:54.750,00:27:59.208,"Man on TV: While no one official is prepared to comment, religious groups are calling it Judgment Day."
00:27:59.250,00:28:09.583,- There's-- As an increasing number of reports of-- Man: Serious attacks on-- People who are literally being-- Man: Eaten alive.
00:28:09.625,00:28:11.041,But witness reports are sketchy.
00:28:11.083,00:28:26.208,"One unifying detail seems to be that the attackers in many instances appear to be-- Dead excited to have with us here a sensational chart-topping-- Man: Or ideological connection between those committing the atrocities, and, perhaps, more alarmingly..."
00:28:26.250,00:28:28.166,Ed: There's a girl in the garden.
00:28:28.208,00:28:31.834,- Emergency services...
00:28:31.875,00:28:33.834,"In the garden, there is a girl."
00:28:33.875,00:28:38.667,The armed forces will be called in to provide backup and assistance.
00:28:38.709,00:28:46.709,Scientists are still trying to establish the cause and nature of the phenomenon and are unsure as to the...
00:28:46.750,00:28:48.083,Excuse me.
00:28:51.875,00:28:53.417,Excuse me.
00:28:56.333,00:28:57.458,Hello.
00:29:02.208,00:29:03.750,- What are you doing?
00:29:23.208,00:29:24.417,"Oh, my God."
00:29:26.959,00:29:28.625,She's so drunk.
00:29:32.625,00:29:33.625,"How much have you had, love?"
00:29:35.041,00:29:37.625,- Oh! I think she likes you.
00:29:37.667,00:29:39.333,I think she wants a cuddle!
00:29:39.375,00:29:43.458,"Listen, serious, I've just come out of a relationship."
00:29:43.500,00:29:45.291,"- Ed, do something!"
00:29:45.333,00:29:47.083,- Ed!
00:29:47.125,00:29:52.083,"Jesus, I'm really flattered and everything, really, but..."
00:29:52.125,00:29:54.583,"And, hold it there."
00:29:54.625,00:29:57.166,Ed! Just get her off me.!
00:29:59.500,00:30:01.083,"Whoa, What's up with her eyes?"
00:30:01.125,00:30:03.041,- What's up with her eyes?
00:30:03.083,00:30:08.083,"uh... uh, Mary, I'm warning you, I'm gonna have to get physical, I mean it!"
00:30:08.125,00:30:10.375,This is it.
00:30:45.000,00:30:46.375,I think we should go back inside.
00:30:46.417,00:30:47.542,Okay.
00:30:56.291,00:30:59.458,"- Shaun, what's going on?"
00:30:59.500,00:31:03.458,- How about an ambulance?
00:31:03.500,00:31:06.542,- Fire engine?
00:31:06.583,00:31:08.625,"Okay, what do you want a fire engine for anyway?"
00:31:08.667,00:31:11.291,"Anything with flashing lights, you know."
00:31:11.333,00:31:12.792,Are they still out there?
00:31:20.375,00:31:21.750,Yeah.
00:31:21.792,00:31:24.291,What do you think we should do?
00:31:24.333,00:31:26.291,Have a sit-down?
00:31:26.333,00:31:31.875,Man on TV: There are reports of chaos on the motorways as thousands of people attempt to flee the cities.
00:31:31.917,00:31:35.750,"The M1, the M3, M4, M6..."
00:31:35.792,00:31:37.333,Do you think this is the same thing?
00:31:37.375,00:31:41.000,and M68 are all at a standstill.
00:31:41.041,00:31:46.583,The Home Office has issued a statement urging people to stay in their homes and await further instruction.
00:31:46.625,00:31:53.625,Ensure all residences are secure with all doors and windows firmly locked and barricaded.
00:31:53.667,00:32:00.834,"Police have-- Oh, for God's sake!"
00:32:00.875,00:32:02.542,Get him!
00:32:15.500,00:32:22.125,More reports just in confirm that in all cases the attackers seem slow and shambolic...
00:32:22.166,00:32:23.709,I'm gonna shut the front door.
00:32:23.750,00:32:29.375,receive information call the Home Office regarding the best way to neutralize the attackers.
00:32:29.417,00:32:34.458,"In the meantime, contact with these assailants is highly inadvisable."
00:32:34.500,00:32:36.458,- Did you see his head go?
00:32:34.500,00:32:41.500,- If you're confronted and have the opportunity to escape it's suggested that you do so and quickly.
00:32:41.542,00:32:43.750,- We should get out there.
00:32:43.792,00:32:46.291,"- Come on, we can take 'em."
00:32:46.333,00:32:47.875,Fuck the man!
00:32:47.917,00:32:51.875,"Look, as long as they're out there and we're in here, - we're safe."
00:32:53.792,00:32:58.208,The attackers can be stopped by removing the head or destroying the brain.
00:32:58.250,00:33:04.417,I'll repeat that-- by removing the head or destroying the brain.
00:33:08.250,00:33:17.208,Shaun: Aim for the head.
00:33:35.458,00:33:37.667,- Now what?
00:33:37.709,00:33:39.625,- What's in the shed?
00:33:39.667,00:33:41.333,- Why is it locked?
00:33:41.375,00:33:44.542,"Well, you know..."
00:33:44.583,00:33:46.125,"No, no, that's the second album I ever bought!"
00:33:46.166,00:33:47.875,Don't!
00:33:54.250,00:33:55.709,Now some of these are limited.
00:33:55.750,00:33:57.333,"Whoa, whoa, What was that?"
00:33:57.375,00:33:58.792,"Um, I think it was Blue Monday."
00:33:58.834,00:34:00.375,That was an original pressing.
00:34:00.417,00:34:03.166,"Oh, for fuck's sake."
00:34:03.208,00:34:04.583,"- Um, Purple Rain?"
00:34:04.625,00:34:06.125,- Sign O' The Times?
00:34:06.166,00:34:07.625,- The Batman soundtrack?
00:34:11.709,00:34:15.417,- Dire Straits?
00:34:15.458,00:34:17.417,Both: Oh!
00:34:17.458,00:34:20.208,"- Uh, Ooh, Stone Roses?"
00:34:20.250,00:34:22.041,- Second Coming?
00:34:22.083,00:34:24.166,Ah! Sade?
00:34:24.208,00:34:25.834,- That's Liz's.
00:34:25.875,00:34:27.458,No!
00:34:27.500,00:34:29.500,"Oh, fuck this, I'm going to the shed."
00:34:29.542,00:34:30.917,Thought you said it was locked.
00:34:42.208,00:34:44.041,"Which one do you want, girl or bloke?"
00:34:44.083,00:34:45.375,Uh... the first one.
00:35:04.041,00:35:13.083,"Man: In all cases, people receiving bites have experienced headaches and nausea and developed symptoms - similar to those displayed by their attackers."
00:35:13.125,00:35:19.667,"If you know someone who has been bitten, it is absolutely essential that you isolate them immediately."
00:35:19.709,00:35:24.500,The public are being strongly advised not to approach anyone...
00:35:24.542,00:35:26.166,Pete?
00:35:28.625,00:35:30.291,Pete?
00:35:30.333,00:35:32.709,- Why don't we just go up?
00:35:32.750,00:35:35.458,- Why not?
00:35:32.750,00:35:37.583,"- Because A, he might be one of them, and B, he might still be annoyed."
00:35:39.000,00:35:41.125,Pete?
00:35:41.166,00:35:43.333,Maybe he went into work.
00:35:43.375,00:35:46.250,How come he didn't drive?
00:35:46.291,00:35:48.041,"Well, maybe he got a lift."
00:35:48.083,00:35:49.417,He said he wasn't feeling very well.
00:35:49.458,00:35:51.208,Pete?
00:35:51.250,00:35:53.917,"Oy, prick!"
00:35:53.959,00:35:55.041,Both: He's not in.
00:35:55.083,00:35:57.333,You got a fag?
00:35:57.375,00:35:59.166,"No, I've given up."
00:35:59.208,00:36:01.083,- Since when?
00:36:04.250,00:36:06.125,"Come on, babe."
00:36:06.166,00:36:07.542,"Oh, she's engaged."
00:36:07.583,00:36:09.458,- That was quick.
00:36:09.500,00:36:11.041,- Liz!
00:36:11.083,00:36:12.458,- Shaun.
00:36:12.500,00:36:14.417,"Hi, I was gonna call you."
00:36:14.458,00:36:16.750,- Yes.
00:36:16.792,00:36:19.041,Some men tried to get into the house.
00:36:19.083,00:36:20.583,Are they still there?
00:36:20.625,00:36:23.500,I'm not sure.
00:36:23.542,00:36:26.542,- Did you try the police?
00:36:26.583,00:36:28.250,Are you okay?
00:36:28.291,00:36:31.083,"No, I'm fine."
00:36:31.125,00:36:32.291,Mum?
00:36:32.333,00:36:35.041,Well...
00:36:37.166,00:36:40.458,"- Mum, have you been bitten?"
00:36:40.500,00:36:42.917,"- Oh, okay."
00:36:42.959,00:36:44.542,"- No, Philip has."
00:36:44.583,00:36:45.959,"Listen, Mum, what state is he in?"
00:36:46.000,00:36:49.542,"Oh, he's fine, bit under the weather."
00:36:49.583,00:36:50.792,- I see.
00:36:50.834,00:36:52.500,We may have to kill my stepdad.
00:36:52.542,00:36:54.625,"Listen, Mum, sit tight, okay?"
00:36:54.667,00:36:56.917,- We're coming over.
00:36:56.959,00:36:58.875,"We're coming to get you, Barbara!"
00:37:00.875,00:37:02.709,So what's the plan?
00:37:04.750,00:37:07.208,Right.
00:37:07.250,00:37:10.083,We take Pete's car.
00:37:10.125,00:37:13.583,We go in.
00:37:13.625,00:37:15.625,"I'm so sorry, Philip."
00:37:15.667,00:37:22.834,"Then we grab Mum, we go over to Liz's place, hole up, have a cup of tea and wait for all this to blow over."
00:37:24.125,00:37:25.750,Why have we got to go to Liz's?
00:37:25.792,00:37:27.709,- Because we do.
00:37:27.750,00:37:29.792,I have to know if she's all right.
00:37:29.834,00:37:31.709,- Why?
00:37:34.208,00:37:36.792,"All right, gay."
00:37:36.834,00:37:38.291,Why not?
00:37:38.333,00:37:40.542,"If we hole up, I want to be somewhere familiar."
00:37:40.583,00:37:44.000,"I want to know where the exits are, and I want to be allowed to smoke."
00:37:44.041,00:37:45.583,Okay.
00:37:47.667,00:37:51.917,"Take Pete's car, go round Mum's, go in, deal with Philip."
00:37:51.959,00:37:53.291,"Sorry, Philip."
00:37:53.333,00:37:59.917,"Grab Mum, go to Liz's, pick her up, bring her back here, have a cup of tea and wait for all this to blow over."
00:38:01.083,00:38:02.166,Per-fik.
00:38:02.208,00:38:05.000,"No, no, no, no, no, wait, we can't bring them back here."
00:38:05.041,00:38:07.750,- Why not?
00:38:07.792,00:38:11.333,"Um, yeah."
00:38:11.375,00:38:13.834,Where's safe?
00:38:13.875,00:38:15.125,Where can I smoke?
00:38:20.542,00:38:23.125,"Take car, go to Mum's, kill Phil."
00:38:23.166,00:38:24.542,Sorry.
00:38:24.583,00:38:29.709,"Grab Liz, go to the Winchester, have a nice cold pint and wait for all this to blow over."
00:38:31.959,00:38:34.041,How's that for a slice of fried gold?
00:38:34.083,00:38:35.917,"Yeah, boy!"
00:38:35.959,00:38:39.500,"Man: To recap, it is vital that you stay in your homes."
00:38:39.542,00:38:45.709,Make no attempt to reach loved ones and avoid all physical contact with the assailants.
00:38:45.750,00:38:47.625,Do you believe everything you hear on TV?
00:38:49.959,00:38:51.750,"Yeah, I can see it."
00:38:51.792,00:38:53.083,It's just outside.
00:38:53.125,00:38:56.000,Any zombies out there?
00:38:56.041,00:38:57.875,- Don't say that.
00:38:57.917,00:38:59.750,- That.
00:38:59.792,00:39:02.250,That. The Z word.
00:39:02.291,00:39:05.083,- Why not?
00:39:05.125,00:39:07.375,All right.
00:39:07.417,00:39:08.625,"Are there any out there, though?"
00:39:10.625,00:39:12.125,Can't see any.
00:39:12.166,00:39:13.792,Maybe it's not as bad as all that.
00:39:13.834,00:39:15.333,"Oh, no, there they are."
00:39:18.333,00:39:19.500,"- Okay, let's do this, yeah?"
00:39:19.542,00:39:20.792,- Yeah.
00:39:20.834,00:39:22.166,- Yeah?
00:39:22.208,00:39:25.625,"- Uh, ooh... can I drive?"
00:39:25.667,00:39:28.041,- What?
00:39:28.083,00:39:30.291,I might not get another chance.
00:39:30.333,00:39:31.750,Okay.
00:40:04.500,00:40:05.917,"Ah! Oh, God."
00:40:05.959,00:40:07.375,"Sorry, Pete."
00:40:07.417,00:40:10.250,"Um, listen, we're gonna borrow your car, okay?"
00:40:10.291,00:40:12.417,"Um, we'll bring it back."
00:40:12.458,00:40:19.333,"And if you're feeling better later, we're-- we're going to the pub, so you're more than welcome to, uh..."
00:40:21.542,00:40:22.750,join us.
00:40:30.667,00:40:33.583,"Pete'd be so pissed off if he knew I was driving his car, eh?"
00:40:33.625,00:40:34.792,I don't think so.
00:40:37.000,00:40:39.667,"Shaun, Shaun, which button's central locking?"
00:40:46.125,00:40:47.375,"Oh, cock it!"
00:40:47.417,00:40:49.792,Get lost!
00:41:04.583,00:41:05.583,Drive.
00:41:07.750,00:41:15.875,Woman on radio: The Church of England has now joined other extremist religious groups in proclaiming the phenomenon a sign of a coming apocalypse.
00:41:15.917,00:41:20.083,Although Downing Street is refusing to be drawn into a religious debate.
00:41:20.125,00:41:25.417,"Once again, the bodies of the recently deceased are returning to life and attacking the living."
00:41:25.458,00:41:27.333,- There is no...
00:41:27.375,00:41:31.041,indication as to how or indeed why-- - What are you doing?
00:41:31.083,00:41:32.083,"Ed, look out!"
00:41:36.250,00:41:37.834,I think we hit something.
00:41:40.625,00:41:42.083,Or someone.
00:41:42.125,00:41:43.959,- Ow!
00:41:52.333,00:41:55.166,Are you all right?
00:41:55.208,00:41:57.083,"Come on, let's just go."
00:41:57.125,00:41:58.750,Hello?
00:41:58.792,00:42:01.333,- He's gonna be dead either way.
00:42:08.500,00:42:09.959,"Oh, thank God for that."
00:42:15.166,00:42:17.959,"Oh, hello."
00:42:18.000,00:42:19.667,Who's a pretty boy then?
00:42:23.041,00:42:25.417,You didn't tell me Barbara had a Jag.
00:42:25.458,00:42:27.959,- I've always wanted to drive one of those.
00:42:28.000,00:42:29.583,And he won't let anybody near it.
00:42:29.625,00:42:33.083,I put a half a Mars bar in the glove box once and he chased me round the garden with a bit of wood.
00:42:33.125,00:42:34.667,"Fuck, it's gorgeous."
00:42:34.709,00:42:36.792,"Okay, well, it seems pretty clear, we should go."
00:42:36.834,00:42:39.458,Why don't I stay here?
00:42:39.500,00:42:41.792,"What, what, what, what, what?"
00:42:41.834,00:42:43.750,"You know, to look after the car."
00:42:43.792,00:42:45.542,- If there's any problems...
00:42:45.583,00:42:47.917,I'll honk three times.
00:42:47.959,00:42:49.583,Okay.
00:42:53.834,00:42:56.208,- Don't forget to kill Philip!
00:42:57.625,00:43:00.000,"- Hello, pickle."
00:43:00.041,00:43:02.125,"Oh, you've got red on you."
00:43:02.166,00:43:04.083,"Yeah, look, Mum, is everything okay?"
00:43:04.125,00:43:05.417,Are you all right?
00:43:05.458,00:43:08.000,"- Yes, I'm fine."
00:43:08.041,00:43:09.834,- Dad's in the lounge.
00:43:09.875,00:43:11.208,"Oh, Shaun, really!"
00:43:11.250,00:43:12.875,"Sorry, Mum, look, I've got Ed outside."
00:43:12.917,00:43:14.208,We're gonna take you somewhere safe.
00:43:14.250,00:43:15.583,But we have to wait for the doctor.
00:43:15.625,00:43:17.041,"Mum, I don't think the doctor's gonna come."
00:43:17.083,00:43:21.125,"I don't think Philip's going to want - to leave the house, darling-- - Mum, Philip isn't..."
00:43:21.166,00:43:24.291,"Put the kettle on, and I'll deal with Philip."
00:43:24.333,00:43:25.959,- Okay.
00:43:26.000,00:43:28.041,- Are you hungry?
00:43:28.083,00:43:31.166,- I'll make some sandwiches.
00:43:31.208,00:43:33.208,"No fighting, you two."
00:43:37.083,00:43:38.959,Man on TV: You may ask where is our God?
00:43:39.000,00:43:47.875,"But throughout the land, men and women of integrity rise up to confront the unseen enemy."
00:43:47.917,00:43:52.333,"They will not be cowards, They will be courageous in the face of danger."
00:43:59.625,00:44:00.959,"- I'm so sorry, Philip."
00:44:01.000,00:44:02.291,Ah!
00:44:02.333,00:44:04.417,- What have you done now?
00:44:04.458,00:44:07.250,What have you got there?
00:44:07.291,00:44:09.417,No... cricket bat.
00:44:09.458,00:44:12.417,"- Is that for the jumble, Shaun?"
00:44:12.458,00:44:14.083,There's a box of your toys upstairs.
00:44:14.125,00:44:16.250,I was going to give them to the jumble.
00:44:16.291,00:44:18.083,"I took them all to the tip, Barbara."
00:44:18.125,00:44:20.583,"- Oh, what?"
00:44:20.625,00:44:22.417,Don't be silly.
00:44:22.458,00:44:25.583,"Well, maybe you should stay here and wait for the doctor, and I'll take Mum."
00:44:25.625,00:44:27.083,But you said the doctor wasn't coming.
00:44:27.125,00:44:29.041,"You didn't call the doctor, did you?"
00:44:29.083,00:44:30.834,"Well, I thought we ought to be on the safe side."
00:44:30.875,00:44:33.583,"I'm quite all right, Barbara."
00:44:33.625,00:44:37.375,Barbara: I really think-- We had our jabs when we went to the Isle of Wight.
00:44:37.417,00:44:41.875,"- But, Philip-- - It's a lot of overblown nonsense, a lot of drug nuts running wild."
00:44:41.917,00:44:44.458,"Still, I should get Mum away, you know, just in case they come back."
00:44:44.500,00:44:46.166,I'm not going anywhere without Philip.
00:44:46.208,00:44:48.458,"- Mum, look!"
00:44:48.500,00:44:50.959,How about that tea?
00:44:51.041,00:44:54.750,"Mum, how much do you love Philip?"
00:44:54.792,00:44:56.208,"Two sugars, is it?"
00:44:56.250,00:44:58.083,I haven't had sugar in my tea since 1982.
00:44:58.125,00:45:01.583,"Oh, yes, will you cut me some bread, love?"
00:45:01.625,00:45:04.125,"Mum, look, how much do you love Philip?"
00:45:04.166,00:45:06.208,"Oh, Shaun, do we have to go through all that again?"
00:45:06.250,00:45:11.041,"Mum, look, what would you say if I told you that over the years, Philip's been quite unkind to me?"
00:45:11.083,00:45:12.917,You weren't always the easiest person to live with.
00:45:12.959,00:45:14.959,He chased me round the garden with a bit of wood!
00:45:15.000,00:45:16.542,"Well, you did call him a you-know-what."
00:45:16.583,00:45:17.917,"Oh, what?"
00:45:17.959,00:45:19.291,"- Yes, he did."
00:45:19.333,00:45:21.667,- Shaun!
00:45:21.709,00:45:25.583,"Look, Mum, did you know that on several occasions..."
00:45:25.625,00:45:27.250,he touched me?
00:45:32.125,00:45:34.583,"That wasn't true, made it up, shouldn't have done, sorry."
00:45:34.625,00:45:37.709,"you don't understand-- No, it's you that doesn't understand."
00:45:37.750,00:45:40.458,Philip is my husband and has been for the last 17 years.
00:45:40.500,00:45:46.208,"I know you haven't always seen eye to eye, but I would at least expect you to respect my feelings."
00:45:46.250,00:45:48.250,You must be more adult about these things.
00:45:48.291,00:45:49.834,Yeah.
00:45:49.875,00:45:52.792,"Come on, Shaun."
00:45:52.834,00:45:55.750,There comes a time when...
00:45:55.792,00:45:59.166,you just...
00:46:07.834,00:46:10.667,"I'm telling you, it's a fuss over nothing."
00:46:10.709,00:46:12.667,"- Hello, Edward."
00:46:12.709,00:46:14.208,"Barbara: My, how you've grown."
00:46:14.250,00:46:15.875,"Yeah, you better believe it."
00:46:15.917,00:46:18.083,What happened?
00:46:18.125,00:46:19.750,It wasn't as easy as all that.
00:46:19.792,00:46:21.291,"So we're following you, are we?"
00:46:21.333,00:46:23.792,"No, it's probably best if we..."
00:46:23.834,00:46:26.083,Where's the car?
00:46:26.125,00:46:29.333,Hmm... I pranged it.
00:46:29.375,00:46:30.667,You were parked.
00:46:30.709,00:46:32.750,Yeah.
00:46:32.792,00:46:35.792,I guess we'll have to take the Jag.
00:46:37.000,00:46:38.583,- Philip?
00:46:38.625,00:46:41.250,Look out!
00:46:42.792,00:46:45.208,Christ!
00:46:45.250,00:46:46.250,Jeez!
00:46:51.709,00:46:52.959,"Philip, give me the car keys!"
00:46:53.000,00:46:54.208,You're not driving that car.
00:46:54.250,00:46:57.625,Philip...
00:46:57.667,00:46:58.959,"Ed, get Mum in the car."
00:46:59.000,00:47:01.667,I'm on it.
00:47:01.709,00:47:04.208,Don't worry about me.
00:47:04.250,00:47:08.125,"- Ed, maybe I should drive."
00:47:08.166,00:47:10.458,"All right, well, just, you know, be careful!"
00:47:21.709,00:47:25.625,Can you please turn that noise down?
00:47:25.667,00:47:28.959,"Are you all right, dear?"
00:47:29.000,00:47:32.083,I'd be fine if it weren't for that bloody racket.
00:47:32.125,00:47:34.750,- It is a bit loud.
00:47:37.208,00:47:39.542,You do realize this is a 20-mile-an-hour zone?
00:47:39.583,00:47:41.792,"Oh, yeah."
00:47:44.667,00:47:46.125,- Here.
00:47:44.667,00:47:47.875,"- Okay, Mum, listen, this isn't gonna take a second, all right?"
00:47:50.333,00:47:52.250,"Philip, have you still got the child locks on?"
00:47:52.291,00:47:55.208,"Safety first, Shaun."
00:47:55.250,00:47:58.208,You can't...
00:47:58.250,00:48:03.125,"Hey, man, watch the leather."
00:48:03.166,00:48:04.750,"Listen, okay, keep moving."
00:48:04.792,00:48:09.417,"If there's any problems-- - Yeah, I'll do the honks."
00:48:33.125,00:48:34.875,Dianne: Hello?
00:48:37.000,00:48:38.375,Hello?
00:49:00.834,00:49:02.583,"Guys, can you let me in, please?"
00:49:02.625,00:49:04.667,- What are you doing?
00:49:18.250,00:49:19.500,"Sorry, what are you doing?"
00:49:19.542,00:49:21.000,I've come to take you somewhere safe.
00:49:21.041,00:49:23.000,We were perfectly safe before you arrived.
00:49:23.041,00:49:24.458,You don't know that.
00:49:24.500,00:49:26.208,There was two of them out there a minute ago.
00:49:26.250,00:49:27.625,How many are there now?
00:49:27.667,00:49:29.417,- Lots.
00:49:29.458,00:49:31.667,"Believe me, it only takes one of them to know you're in here."
00:49:31.709,00:49:33.041,"Listen, I tried calling."
00:49:33.083,00:49:34.583,But I couldn't get through.
00:49:34.625,00:49:36.792,- I had to come up with a plan.
00:49:36.834,00:49:39.667,"Look, I don't care what the telly says, We have to get out of here."
00:49:39.709,00:49:42.291,"If we don't, they'll come up here and they'll tear us to pieces."
00:49:42.333,00:49:44.000,And that is really gonna exacerbate things for all of us.
00:49:44.041,00:49:45.375,Shaun...
00:49:45.417,00:49:48.333,"Look, Liz, this is not about you and me, all right?"
00:49:48.375,00:49:49.583,This is about survival.
00:49:49.625,00:49:53.834,"We need to be somewhere more secure, somewhere on the ground, somewhere where we can stay alive."
00:49:53.875,00:49:56.041,"- We're with you, Shaun."
00:49:56.083,00:49:59.250,- We're with you?
00:49:59.291,00:50:03.875,"Daffs! I don't want to be torn to pieces, and I'm sure if you really think about it, neither do you."
00:50:03.917,00:50:06.458,- I'm not going if Lizzie's not going.
00:50:06.500,00:50:07.792,"Well, I'm not staying here by myself."
00:50:07.834,00:50:09.333,"You're going, aren't you, Elizabeth?"
00:50:09.375,00:50:11.709,- Lizzie?
00:50:16.333,00:50:18.125,"All right, Flash, what do you have in mind?"
00:50:18.166,00:50:22.000,"Great, okay, I've got a car outside but it's gonna be a bit cramped now."
00:50:22.041,00:50:23.208,So has anyone got transport?
00:50:23.250,00:50:24.959,"- Yes, yes!"
00:50:25.000,00:50:27.959,"Oh, no."
00:50:28.000,00:50:29.583,David?
00:50:29.625,00:50:31.333,I don't see the point of owning a car in London.
00:50:31.375,00:50:35.166,"Look, okay, just get any blunt objects together."
00:50:35.208,00:50:36.917,"If you get cornered, bash them in the head."
00:50:36.959,00:50:38.333,That seems to work out.
00:50:38.375,00:50:40.875,"Keep together, stay sharp, and follow me."
00:50:40.917,00:50:43.583,"So what-- what's the plan, then?"
00:50:43.625,00:50:45.291,We're going to the Winchester.
00:50:50.250,00:50:52.041,"Okay, let's go."
00:51:08.250,00:51:09.750,- Come on.
00:51:14.959,00:51:15.959,"What's up, niggaz?"
00:51:21.542,00:51:23.709,"Okay, apologies for the cramped conditions, everybody."
00:51:23.750,00:51:25.500,"- Okay, Di, can you stay on David's lap."
00:51:25.542,00:51:28.792,"Philip, hang in there, okay?"
00:51:28.834,00:51:31.041,"And, Mum, this is Liz."
00:51:31.083,00:51:32.166,Both: Hello.
00:51:39.750,00:51:40.792,- Ed!
00:51:39.750,00:51:42.166,"- Shaun-- I know, Ed, be careful!"
00:51:42.208,00:51:43.959,- Is your dad all right?
00:51:44.000,00:51:46.417,- He's bleeding.
00:51:46.458,00:51:47.792,Thought you wanted to get there fast.
00:51:50.417,00:51:51.875,"I just want to get there in one piece, okay!"
00:51:51.917,00:51:52.917,Why are we going this way?
00:51:52.959,00:51:54.834,"Chill out, it's a shortcut."
00:51:54.875,00:51:56.917,- But that road goes to the Winchester.
00:51:56.959,00:51:59.750,"- Look, I know, - Liz, please!"
00:51:59.792,00:52:02.875,I still don't actually understand why we are going to the Winchester?
00:52:02.917,00:52:04.333,"Because it's a pub, it's safe."
00:52:04.375,00:52:05.625,- It's secure.
00:52:05.667,00:52:07.083,What makes it so secure?
00:52:07.125,00:52:09.041,Because It's got big heavy doors and deadbolts.
00:52:09.083,00:52:10.375,- You've been to a lock-in.
00:52:10.417,00:52:11.667,And there's a rifle above the bar.
00:52:11.709,00:52:13.458,I would think that's deactivated.
00:52:13.500,00:52:15.375,- Surely.
00:52:15.417,00:52:16.834,John's connected.
00:52:16.875,00:52:18.625,"Well, Big Al also says dogs can't look up."
00:52:18.667,00:52:20.041,- They can't.
00:52:20.083,00:52:21.375,"- No, they can't."
00:52:21.417,00:52:22.792,- Are you sure?
00:52:22.834,00:52:24.625,"Look, the pub is the right place to go, okay?"
00:52:24.667,00:52:26.458,Everything is gonna be fine.
00:52:26.500,00:52:28.375,- Shaun...
00:52:28.417,00:52:31.083,- It's not easy-- - What?
00:52:31.125,00:52:32.750,"Being a father, it's not easy."
00:52:32.792,00:52:34.208,What?
00:52:34.250,00:52:37.458,You were 12 when I met you.
00:52:37.500,00:52:39.583,You'd already grown up so much.
00:52:39.625,00:52:45.917,I just wanted you to be strong and not give up because you lost your dad.
00:52:45.959,00:52:47.917,"Philip, you don't have to explain."
00:52:47.959,00:52:49.792,"No, I d-- I do."
00:52:49.834,00:52:52.000,"I-- I always loved you, Shaun."
00:52:52.041,00:52:56.917,And I always thought you had it in you to-- to do well...
00:52:56.959,00:52:59.834,You just need...
00:52:59.875,00:53:03.709,"m-motivation, somebody to look up to, and..."
00:53:06.375,00:53:08.166,I thought it could be me.
00:53:10.417,00:53:13.542,Would you just...
00:53:16.709,00:53:18.375,There's a good boy.
00:53:21.917,00:53:26.250,"- Ed, can you pull over?"
00:53:26.291,00:53:27.875,- Ooh!
00:53:27.917,00:53:30.000,"- Ed, please pull over."
00:53:30.041,00:53:32.083,"- Ed, just pull over!"
00:53:38.250,00:53:39.834,"Whoa, mama!"
00:53:39.875,00:53:41.625,"Christ, what the hell do you think you are you doing?"
00:53:41.667,00:53:42.959,Chill out.
00:53:43.000,00:53:45.208,Stop telling me to chill out!
00:53:47.083,00:53:49.208,"And, no, for your information, everybody's not all right."
00:53:49.250,00:53:50.375,Liz: What's wrong?
00:53:50.417,00:53:53.083,"Mum, it's Philip, he's gone."
00:53:53.125,00:53:56.625,- Where's he gone?
00:53:56.667,00:53:59.000,"No, he isn't."
00:53:59.041,00:54:02.500,Get out!
00:54:02.542,00:54:05.417,Jesus!
00:54:05.458,00:54:08.333,- It won't open!
00:54:08.375,00:54:10.083,Come on!
00:54:12.417,00:54:14.792,- The child lock!
00:54:33.458,00:54:35.917,- Now what?
00:54:35.959,00:54:38.208,"- Well, how do we get Philip out of the car?"
00:54:38.250,00:54:40.041,- What about the blunt objects?
00:54:40.083,00:54:41.417,"Shaun, we can't leave your dad."
00:54:41.458,00:54:42.792,- He's not my dad!
00:54:42.834,00:54:44.959,"Mum, he was, but he's not any more."
00:54:45.000,00:54:47.250,- I really think we could...
00:54:47.291,00:54:49.083,"That's not even your husband in there, okay?"
00:54:49.125,00:54:53.291,"I know it looks like him, but there is nothing of the man you loved in that car, now, nothing!"
00:54:56.208,00:54:58.750,"Let's go, shall we?"
00:54:58.792,00:55:00.625,You're not seriously suggesting we walk?
00:55:02.917,00:55:04.291,Everybody okay back there?
00:55:04.333,00:55:07.125,"Oh, yeah, we're having a whale of a time."
00:55:07.166,00:55:10.333,"Maybe we should all hold hands, make a crocodile?"
00:55:10.375,00:55:12.625,Do you have any idea where we're actually going?
00:55:12.667,00:55:14.917,"- David, come on."
00:55:14.959,00:55:17.291,"- Do you, though?"
00:55:17.333,00:55:18.834,Are we close?
00:55:25.333,00:55:26.542,We're pretty close.
00:55:26.583,00:55:28.333,Is your mum gonna be okay?
00:55:28.375,00:55:30.583,"Yeah, I hope so."
00:55:30.625,00:55:32.792,- Manage to get in contact with your folks?
00:55:32.834,00:55:35.500,- Do you think this is happening there?
00:55:35.542,00:55:37.458,"Listen, Liz, about last night."
00:55:37.500,00:55:40.917,"I know loads of things were said, but-- Shaun, you said this wasn't about you and me."
00:55:40.959,00:55:42.792,"- No, it's not, but I-- - You said it was about survival."
00:55:42.834,00:55:46.458,"Yeah, it is, but what I'm saying is-- You're not doing all this just to prove something, are you?"
00:55:46.500,00:55:47.959,"No, of course not."
00:55:46.500,00:55:49.583,I just think-- Because I meant everything I said last night.
00:55:49.625,00:55:52.125,Nothing's changed.
00:55:52.166,00:55:54.667,Maybe this isn't the best time to talk about it.
00:55:54.709,00:55:57.583,"- Okay, but look-- - Oh, my God!"
00:55:57.625,00:55:59.417,Shaun.
00:55:59.458,00:56:00.500,Yvonne.
00:56:00.542,00:56:02.000,How's it going?
00:56:02.041,00:56:03.834,"Uh, um, surviving."
00:56:03.875,00:56:05.834,"Hey, Liz."
00:56:05.875,00:56:07.709,"Hey, Yvonne."
00:56:07.750,00:56:10.417,"Um... this is my boyfriend, Declan."
00:56:10.458,00:56:14.750,"Um, my friends Mark, Maggie, my mum, and my cousin Tom."
00:56:14.792,00:56:16.500,All right.
00:56:16.542,00:56:18.667,"This is Shaun and his girlfriend, Liz."
00:56:18.709,00:56:21.208,"- They've split up, actually."
00:56:21.250,00:56:22.250,Yeah.
00:56:22.291,00:56:24.208,That's a shame.
00:56:24.250,00:56:25.709,"Well, we should scoot."
00:56:25.750,00:56:27.208,Have you got somewhere you're going?
00:56:27.250,00:56:29.542,"Yeah, we're going to the Winchester."
00:56:29.583,00:56:31.125,- The pub.
00:56:32.875,00:56:35.375,- Yeah.
00:56:41.583,00:56:43.291,Hi.
00:56:43.333,00:56:44.709,Hello.
00:56:44.750,00:56:46.041,Hi.
00:56:46.083,00:56:47.875,Hello.
00:56:47.917,00:56:50.875,All right.
00:56:50.917,00:56:52.208,See? What did I say.
00:56:52.250,00:56:53.542,The Winchester's just over there.
00:56:53.583,00:56:55.750,- Over where?
00:56:55.792,00:56:59.250,"Just over there, over the 20 garden fences?"
00:56:59.291,00:57:01.917,"What's the matter, David?"
00:57:01.959,00:57:03.667,Never taken a shortcut before?
00:57:21.333,00:57:23.542,Shaun?
00:57:23.583,00:57:25.875,I'm sure Jill and Derek live round here.
00:57:39.709,00:57:43.500,"Now the Winchester is just over that fence, all right?"
00:57:43.542,00:57:46.750,"So everyone stay where they are, I'll-- hang on, are we all here?"
00:57:46.792,00:57:49.166,"Uh, one, two, three, four, five, yes."
00:57:49.208,00:57:51.000,- There's six of us.
00:57:52.375,00:57:53.375,Mum!
00:57:55.917,00:57:58.291,I'm coming!
00:57:58.333,00:58:01.291,"Mum, Mum, Mum, are you okay?"
00:58:01.333,00:58:03.125,I don't think Jill and Derek do live here.
00:58:06.458,00:58:07.709,Shaun?
00:58:11.166,00:58:12.625,Are you all right?
00:58:25.709,00:58:26.917,Oy!
00:58:31.458,00:58:32.542,What are you doing?
00:58:35.667,00:58:36.875,Shaun!
00:58:40.375,00:58:41.500,Yes!
00:58:44.208,00:58:45.875,"No, that's rubbish."
00:58:53.709,00:58:55.208,Yes!
00:58:57.834,00:59:00.000,Feel free to step in any time!
00:59:00.041,00:59:01.375,You did all right.
00:59:01.417,00:59:03.000,I didn't want to cramp your style.
00:59:03.041,00:59:04.667,- Wha-- - I'm so sorry about that.
00:59:06.917,00:59:08.208,Right.
00:59:11.125,00:59:12.709,"Okay, everyone just stay where they are."
00:59:12.750,00:59:14.417,I'm gonna check if the coast is clear.
00:59:24.291,00:59:26.250,- Is it clear?
00:59:26.291,00:59:28.291,- Liz: How many?
00:59:38.500,00:59:42.333,"Oh, well, that is just great."
00:59:42.375,00:59:44.041,"There are a fair few of them, yes."
00:59:44.083,00:59:47.125,I trust Shaun has another genius scheme up his sleeve?
00:59:47.166,00:59:49.542,"This is hardly constructive, David!"
00:59:49.583,00:59:51.542,"No, Lizzie, this is a waste of time."
00:59:51.583,00:59:52.917,We should have stayed at the flat.
00:59:52.959,00:59:54.291,"- Yeah, Why didn't you?"
00:59:52.959,00:59:57.959,"- Because-- because, because of..."
00:59:58.000,00:59:59.375,Will you stop it?
00:59:59.417,01:00:01.166,"Yes, we're not get anywhere by moaning."
01:00:10.166,01:00:13.750,"Right, let's all shake out."
01:00:13.792,01:00:15.208,Or not.
01:00:15.250,01:00:17.500,Now take another look at the way he moves.
01:00:17.542,01:00:20.417,"Remember, very limp, almost like sleepwalking."
01:00:20.458,01:00:22.083,Look at the face.
01:00:22.125,01:00:26.834,"It's vacant with a hint of sadness, like a drunk who's lost a bet."
01:00:26.875,01:00:30.125,"Okay, let's try, shall we? Liz."
01:00:33.083,01:00:34.625,Nice.
01:00:34.667,01:00:37.709,"Okay, Barbara, that's excellent."
01:00:37.750,01:00:40.875,"Sorry, dear, I was miles away."
01:00:40.917,01:00:43.041,- Daffs?
01:00:43.083,01:00:45.458,- Come on!
01:00:45.500,01:00:47.709,"It's mournful, sorrowful, you're dead and you hate it."
01:00:47.750,01:00:49.375,Go.
01:00:49.417,01:00:51.041,- Uh.
01:00:51.083,01:00:52.625,- Ed.
01:00:52.667,01:00:55.709,- This is the night!
01:00:55.750,01:00:56.834,What is that?
01:00:56.875,01:00:58.458,- What about yours?
01:00:58.500,01:01:00.458,Who died and made you fucking king of the zombies?
01:01:00.500,01:01:02.041,"Oh, don't..."
01:01:05.792,01:01:08.959,"- Yeah, that's pretty good."
01:01:09.000,01:01:10.625,"Let's all try together, shall we?"
01:01:10.667,01:01:13.583,"One, two, three."
01:02:07.166,01:02:09.166,"Go, go, go, go."
01:02:11.917,01:02:14.583,"Shit! Get round me, get round me!"
01:02:14.625,01:02:17.375,"John? John, Bernie, are you there?"
01:02:17.417,01:02:19.375,It's Shaun and Ed.
01:02:19.417,01:02:21.625,- They can hear you.
01:02:21.667,01:02:23.625,- They know.
01:02:23.667,01:02:26.083,- I can't see them.
01:02:26.125,01:02:27.792,- Break the window.
01:02:27.834,01:02:29.959,- We'll be totally exposed!
01:02:30.000,01:02:31.917,- Break the window!
01:02:31.959,01:02:38.000,"- Well, yeah, there's-- Two seconds."
01:02:38.041,01:02:40.166,"- You all right, mate?"
01:02:40.208,01:02:42.041,- Did get anything yet?
01:02:42.083,01:02:44.291,- Really?
01:02:44.333,01:02:46.542,- In the middle of something?
01:02:46.583,01:02:49.083,- Oy! What you doing?
01:02:49.125,01:02:50.667,"What are you doing, you stupid moron?"
01:02:50.709,01:02:52.709,- Fuck off.
01:02:52.750,01:02:55.083,- Fuck fucking off!
01:02:55.125,01:02:57.083,I've spent an entire life-- look at me.
01:02:57.125,01:03:02.750,"I've spent my entire life sticking my neck out for you and all you ever do is fuck things up, fuck things up and make me look stupid."
01:03:02.792,01:03:05.875,"Well, I'm not gonna let you do it anymore, not today!"
01:03:05.917,01:03:06.917,Shaun.
01:03:08.458,01:03:09.458,Oh.
01:03:17.166,01:03:20.125,You were saying about another way in?
01:03:20.166,01:03:23.041,"Yeah, there's a..."
01:03:23.083,01:03:25.291,What are you doing?
01:03:25.333,01:03:28.417,- Shaun: No!
01:03:28.458,01:03:29.834,"- No, they'll follow us."
01:03:29.875,01:03:32.041,They'll follow us.
01:03:32.083,01:03:33.959,- I'll have to do something.
01:03:34.000,01:03:36.291,"Hello, hello, over here, over here, over here!"
01:03:36.333,01:03:38.208,"Come on, come on, that's it."
01:03:38.250,01:03:40.834,"Yeah, come on, come on, come on, that's it, over here."
01:03:40.875,01:03:42.875,"Whoo, over here!"
01:03:42.917,01:03:44.250,"Oh, bollocks."
01:03:44.291,01:03:46.083,"Okay, wait till I've gone then get inside."
01:03:46.125,01:03:48.625,- Gone where?
01:03:48.667,01:03:52.291,"Come on, you pasty-faced fuckers, Let's go! Follow me."
01:03:52.333,01:03:53.834,"Come on, let's go."
01:03:53.875,01:03:56.041,"Come on, this way, this way, that's it!"
01:03:56.083,01:03:58.166,"Come on, come on, this way, follow me!"
01:03:58.208,01:04:00.500,"Come on, follow me!"
01:04:00.542,01:04:02.250,Come and get it!
01:04:02.291,01:04:03.750,It's a running buffet.
01:04:03.792,01:04:06.417,All you can eat!
01:04:06.458,01:04:08.333,"Shall we go in, then?"
01:04:16.792,01:04:18.667,"Come on, Barbara, leave those."
01:04:18.709,01:04:20.250,I think they're for me.
01:04:40.166,01:04:41.542,He's been gone a good 20 minutes.
01:04:41.583,01:04:42.542,17.
01:04:42.583,01:04:46.375,"Either way, we need to think about blocking up this window here."
01:04:46.417,01:04:48.083,We're totally exposed.
01:04:48.125,01:04:51.500,- How will Shaun get back in?
01:04:53.875,01:04:55.875,"For goodness sake, Let's get some lights on."
01:04:55.917,01:04:59.000,"- David, wait!"
01:04:59.041,01:05:00.417,That's a good thing.
01:05:00.458,01:05:03.417,We don't want to advertise our whereabouts more than we already have.
01:05:03.458,01:05:06.375,"- No, of course not."
01:05:06.417,01:05:08.792,"No, of course not, Lizzie."
01:05:08.834,01:05:11.208,I'm just being proactive.
01:05:11.250,01:05:13.041,There's no power.
01:05:13.083,01:05:15.083,And there's that bloody great hole in the window.
01:05:15.125,01:05:17.375,"- You did that, you twat."
01:05:17.417,01:05:20.417,"I don't know if you noticed back there, but we were in a spot of bother."
01:05:20.458,01:05:30.125,"Somebody has to take control of the situation and if none of you are prepared to accept that responsibility then, perhaps..."
01:05:30.166,01:05:31.750,Will Shaun be gone long?
01:05:31.792,01:05:33.125,Liz: He'll be back soon.
01:05:33.166,01:05:34.458,How can you know that?
01:05:34.500,01:05:36.000,"I don't think he'd leave us, Daffs."
01:05:36.041,01:05:37.417,Wouldn't he?
01:05:37.458,01:05:42.417,"Lizzie, How can you put your faith in a man you spectacularly binned for being unreliable?"
01:05:42.458,01:05:46.709,A man whose idea of a romantic nightspot and an impenetrable fortress are the same thing.
01:05:46.750,01:05:49.625,This is a pub!
01:05:49.667,01:05:50.959,What are we going to do?
01:05:51.000,01:05:52.542,We could get a round in.
01:05:52.583,01:05:55.375,"Look, let's just keep quiet and wait for Shaun."
01:05:55.417,01:05:57.417,We can barricade the window when he gets back.
01:05:57.458,01:06:00.083,What then? How long?
01:06:00.125,01:06:01.917,What about food?
01:06:01.959,01:06:03.875,- Toasties!
01:06:03.917,01:06:05.834,"Oh, great then, saved by nibbles!"
01:06:05.875,01:06:08.709,That must be why Shaun took us here before he buggered off.
01:06:08.750,01:06:09.959,He's coming back!
01:06:10.000,01:06:12.583,Why?
01:06:12.625,01:06:18.417,"And even if he does, do you think his master plan is going to extend to anything more than sitting and eating peanuts in the dark?"
01:06:18.458,01:06:21.709,What is he just gonna stroll in and suddenly everything's gonna be okay?
01:06:21.750,01:06:24.250,"I don't know, David!"
01:06:24.291,01:06:25.792,I don't know any more than you do.
01:06:25.834,01:06:32.125,But what I do know is that we're here now and we have to make the best of it.
01:06:32.166,01:06:35.125,"- Ed, get me a double vodka."
01:06:35.166,01:06:36.750,"I think I'll have a drink, too, actually."
01:06:36.792,01:06:38.083,"Would you like a drink, Barbara?"
01:06:38.125,01:06:39.625,- Hello.
01:06:39.667,01:06:41.083,That's what we'll do.
01:06:41.125,01:06:42.166,"We'll have a party, how about that?"
01:06:42.208,01:06:43.834,We all get completely smashed.
01:06:43.875,01:06:46.125,"Oh, look, we've got our-- we've got our nibbles."
01:06:46.166,01:06:48.250,We've got our Mini Cheddars.
01:06:48.291,01:06:49.750,- David!
01:06:49.792,01:06:51.667,"Oh, look, hog lumps."
01:06:57.000,01:06:58.542,Barbara: Pickle!
01:06:58.583,01:07:00.333,"Hello, Mum."
01:07:00.375,01:07:02.041,- Everybody okay?
01:07:02.083,01:07:04.250,- Any sign of John and Bernie?
01:07:04.291,01:07:06.000,- Check upstairs?
01:07:06.041,01:07:09.083,- What's the phone situation?
01:07:09.125,01:07:11.291,Okay.
01:07:11.333,01:07:13.750,Nice of you to join us.
01:07:13.792,01:07:16.500,"Yeah, well, I promised, didn't I?"
01:07:22.125,01:07:26.375,How did you lose them?
01:07:26.417,01:07:27.792,I just gave them the slip.
01:07:27.834,01:07:30.125,"Wasn't difficult, they're not all there."
01:07:30.166,01:07:33.625,"- Well, how did you get in?"
01:07:33.667,01:07:35.709,I tried to tell you before you went and smashed the window.
01:07:35.750,01:07:39.542,"Well, I wasn't the one who was blowing our cover by having a tiff with my boyfriend."
01:07:39.583,01:07:41.500,He's not my boyfriend.
01:07:41.542,01:07:43.166,"Might be a bit warm, the cooler's off."
01:07:43.208,01:07:44.709,"Thanks, babe."
01:07:46.709,01:07:48.625,"So, what's the plan, then?"
01:07:51.291,01:07:53.792,Would anyone like a peanut?
01:08:03.417,01:08:06.500,Why don't you do your Clyde?
01:08:06.542,01:08:08.667,Has anyone seen Every Which Way But Loose?
01:08:08.709,01:08:10.917,Ed does the most amazing impression of the orangutan.
01:08:10.959,01:08:13.875,"- No, it's not."
01:08:13.917,01:08:16.375,"- No, no."
01:08:16.417,01:08:18.875,You've built it up too much.
01:08:18.917,01:08:20.542,"Just do it, yeah, see."
01:08:20.583,01:08:23.083,Everyone wants to see it.
01:08:23.125,01:08:25.709,"- Do it, do it, do it, do it."
01:08:25.750,01:08:27.375,I'm not a performing monkey.
01:08:30.917,01:08:33.041,- The power's on.
01:08:33.083,01:08:34.667,"No, but the streetlights have come on."
01:08:34.709,01:08:36.250,It means the grid isn't out.
01:08:36.291,01:08:37.875,I'll just flip them back on.
01:08:37.917,01:08:39.375,- Liz: What about the lights?
01:08:39.417,01:08:42.291,We don't want to advertise our whereabouts more than we already have.
01:08:42.333,01:08:43.875,The lights operate on a separate circuit.
01:08:43.917,01:08:45.750,I'll just flip the mains breakers.
01:08:45.792,01:08:46.917,"It's quite simple, David."
01:09:16.166,01:09:18.166,- Is that it?
01:09:44.875,01:09:47.500,- Liz?
01:09:47.542,01:09:49.291,Have you got a quid?
01:09:49.333,01:09:50.583,Um...
01:09:53.291,01:09:54.500,Yeah.
01:09:59.792,01:10:02.083,"Never anything on, is there?"
01:10:06.250,01:10:07.291,What?
01:10:10.709,01:10:13.000,I think we might have a bit of a problem.
01:10:13.041,01:10:14.166,What do you mean?
01:10:18.041,01:10:20.542,They followed me.
01:10:20.583,01:10:22.792,I thought you said you gave them the slip.
01:10:22.834,01:10:25.375,Yeah.
01:10:25.417,01:10:29.125,"Well, we'll just have to be extra quiet then, won't we?"
01:10:29.166,01:10:31.291,- What?
01:10:32.667,01:10:34.667,- Hey!
01:10:34.709,01:10:36.375,"Both: Ed, no!"
01:10:36.417,01:10:38.166,Turn it off!
01:11:09.834,01:11:12.875,- Shit!
01:11:12.917,01:11:14.583,- Where the hell did he come from?
01:11:18.792,01:11:20.959,- Who the hell put this on?
01:11:21.000,01:11:22.417,For fuck's sake!
01:11:22.458,01:11:24.709,"Okay, Dianne, get Mum somewhere safe."
01:11:24.750,01:11:25.834,"David, kill the Queen."
01:11:25.875,01:11:27.083,- What?!
01:11:27.125,01:11:28.834,"Liz, Ed, grab something weapon-y?"
01:11:28.875,01:11:30.583,- What about the rifle?
01:11:30.625,01:11:32.083,- Cocktails?
01:11:32.125,01:11:35.917,"The flaming spirits-- Drambuie, Sambuca, brandy, get a rag in, light it."
01:11:35.959,01:11:37.291,But the whole place could go up.
01:11:37.333,01:11:38.625,"What, then?"
01:11:38.667,01:11:40.166,How about pool?
01:11:46.542,01:11:49.792,"Okay, John, it's time at the bar."
01:12:08.667,01:12:11.417,- I can't find the switches!
01:12:45.875,01:12:47.667,Why is Queen still on?!
01:12:47.709,01:12:51.250,- We have a situation!
01:12:51.291,01:12:52.250,Fuck this!
01:12:52.291,01:12:53.709,- Ed!
01:12:53.750,01:12:55.667,Oy!
01:13:02.625,01:13:04.417,Shaun!
01:13:07.083,01:13:08.834,No!
01:13:11.208,01:13:13.333,Yes! Yes!
01:13:15.917,01:13:18.083,Ow-w-w!
01:13:18.125,01:13:19.792,Shauny!
01:13:35.709,01:13:37.041,"Why didn't you just shoot him, man?"
01:13:39.417,01:13:46.917,"Ed, for the last time, it's-- I fucking knew it!"
01:13:46.959,01:13:49.500,What did I tell you?
01:13:49.542,01:13:50.709,Okay.
01:13:55.208,01:13:57.291,But dogs can look up.
01:14:00.291,01:14:02.125,"Okay, has anyone fired a gun before?"
01:14:02.166,01:14:03.709,"- Oh, yeah."
01:14:03.750,01:14:04.750,I'm a pacifist.
01:14:04.792,01:14:06.000,Apart from David and Ed?
01:14:06.041,01:14:07.792,"Sorry, what was Ed's experience?"
01:14:07.834,01:14:09.917,"Uh, he shot his sister in the leg with an air rifle."
01:14:09.959,01:14:11.750,- I think you should do it.
01:14:11.792,01:14:13.750,How can five people operate one gun?
01:14:13.792,01:14:15.625,"None of us have any real experience, okay?"
01:14:15.667,01:14:16.625,Now we've only got...
01:14:16.667,01:14:18.208,- 29.
01:14:18.250,01:14:20.125,- Call them shells.
01:14:20.166,01:14:21.834,We really need to work together on this.
01:14:21.875,01:14:23.917,"I need someone to help me reload, everyone else to look out."
01:14:23.959,01:14:24.959,I will fire.
01:14:25.000,01:14:29.291,"As Bertrand Russell once said, the only thing that will redeem mankind is cooperation."
01:14:29.333,01:14:32.625,I think we can all appreciate the relevance of that now.
01:14:32.667,01:14:34.375,Was that on the back of a beer mat?
01:14:34.417,01:14:36.000,"Yeah, it was Guinness Extra Cold."
01:14:36.041,01:14:37.667,- I won't say anything.
01:14:39.959,01:14:41.667,They definitely want to come in.
01:14:41.709,01:14:43.291,Get Mum out of the way.
01:14:43.333,01:14:46.041,"David, Dianne, let's go."
01:14:48.458,01:14:51.500,- Barbara.
01:14:51.542,01:14:52.834,Would you like to come with me?
01:14:52.875,01:14:54.333,That'd be lovely.
01:14:55.834,01:14:59.250,"It's nice to meet you, finally."
01:14:59.291,01:15:01.041,Shaun's always talking about you.
01:15:01.083,01:15:02.458,- Really?
01:15:02.500,01:15:04.542,- Ah!
01:15:06.959,01:15:09.291,Are you all right?
01:15:09.333,01:15:12.417,I've got something for you.
01:15:12.458,01:15:16.166,"Shaun's father gave me this, Shaun's real father, I mean."
01:15:16.208,01:15:18.000,I'd like you to have it.
01:15:18.041,01:15:19.458,"Barbara, Shaun and I have..."
01:15:19.500,01:15:21.166,It seems only right.
01:15:37.500,01:15:39.083,I didn't want to say anything.
01:15:39.125,01:15:41.250,I thought Shaun would be worried.
01:15:43.041,01:15:44.917,Liz!
01:15:44.959,01:15:47.792,Here they come!
01:15:47.834,01:15:50.166,- Stay behind me!
01:15:50.208,01:15:51.583,"Sorry, we're closed."
01:15:52.625,01:15:54.583,Try the safety button.
01:15:54.625,01:15:56.917,"- Yeah, that happened to me on stage."
01:16:04.750,01:16:06.208,- Over there!
01:16:06.250,01:16:07.375,3:00!
01:16:07.417,01:16:08.542,Oh!
01:16:13.917,01:16:15.750,"Oh, over there again."
01:16:15.792,01:16:17.542,What?
01:16:17.583,01:16:20.917,- 11:45!
01:16:20.959,01:16:24.583,Top left!
01:16:24.625,01:16:26.834,- Reload.
01:16:26.875,01:16:28.166,"Come on, come on."
01:16:32.667,01:16:34.250,Nice shot.
01:16:34.291,01:16:36.375,"Okay, David, Dianne, let's block up this window!"
01:16:36.417,01:16:40.166,"Ed, take over for a sec."
01:16:40.208,01:16:42.959,- What is it? What's wrong?
01:16:43.000,01:16:45.333,"- Mum, what's wrong?"
01:16:49.792,01:16:53.625,"- Mum, I don't understand."
01:16:53.667,01:16:56.500,I didn't want to say anything.
01:16:56.542,01:16:58.250,"No, you should've said."
01:17:00.291,01:17:03.000,- Take over a sec.
01:17:03.041,01:17:04.542,What's up?
01:17:04.583,01:17:07.208,- What the hell's going on?
01:17:07.250,01:17:08.875,Just take over a minute.
01:17:08.917,01:17:10.417,Ed: Jesus.
01:17:10.458,01:17:12.709,Dianne: I know first aid.
01:17:12.750,01:17:15.041,Shaun: Just hang on!
01:17:15.083,01:17:16.250,Mum...
01:17:16.291,01:17:17.500,- Mum.
01:17:17.542,01:17:18.917,Shaun...
01:17:18.959,01:17:21.291,"Just hold on, Mum, you're gonna be fine."
01:17:21.333,01:17:23.875,- I never thanked you.
01:17:25.667,01:17:28.583,For these.
01:17:31.375,01:17:35.291,"It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?"
01:17:35.333,01:17:38.208,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no!"
01:17:38.250,01:17:40.375,"Stop it, stop it, stop it."
01:17:40.417,01:17:43.458,"Don't Mum, please don't go."
01:17:54.417,01:17:57.000,- What are you doing?
01:17:57.041,01:18:00.000,- Daffs!
01:18:00.041,01:18:02.166,- She's gonna come back!
01:18:02.208,01:18:05.625,"- Well, she'll change."
01:18:05.667,01:18:07.834,- She's a zombie.
01:18:07.875,01:18:11.625,Move aside.
01:18:11.667,01:18:13.166,One...
01:18:13.208,01:18:14.458,two...
01:18:14.500,01:18:15.667,three!
01:18:15.709,01:18:17.542,Don't point that gun at my mum!
01:18:17.583,01:18:19.000,"Shaun, calm down."
01:18:19.041,01:18:21.083,Don't point that gun at Barbara!
01:18:21.125,01:18:23.291,"- Ed, don't exacerbate things!"
01:18:23.333,01:18:26.250,- This isn't exactly fair.
01:18:26.291,01:18:29.750,- Thank you.
01:18:29.792,01:18:32.041,"Please, can we just stop and think about this?"
01:18:32.083,01:18:34.125,Tell him to put the gun down!
01:18:34.166,01:18:35.667,"Look, Lizzie, she's gonna change."
01:18:35.709,01:18:39.792,"You know I'm right, and when she does, she'll come back, and she'll kill all of us."
01:18:39.834,01:18:41.625,That's what your ex can't seem to realize.
01:18:41.667,01:18:43.375,"That's what this is about, isn't it?"
01:18:43.417,01:18:45.375,It's just-- it's just he doesn't like me!
01:18:45.417,01:18:47.625,He's always hated me and now he wants to shoot my mum.
01:18:47.667,01:18:51.333,"- She's not-- - You've never thought I deserved her, that I was good enough!"
01:18:51.375,01:18:53.208,- What are you talking about?
01:18:53.250,01:18:54.875,We all know you're in love with Liz.
01:18:54.917,01:18:57.125,- That is not true.
01:18:57.166,01:18:59.125,- That is not true.
01:18:59.166,01:19:00.500,What?
01:19:00.542,01:19:06.792,"I know you only hung out with me at college to get close to Liz, and when she knocked you back, I was there to pick up the pieces."
01:19:06.834,01:19:10.834,"I've come to terms with that, Daffs, why can't you?"
01:19:10.875,01:19:15.625,"Lizzie, I want you to know that my feelings for you have always been essentially-- David, please!"
01:19:15.667,01:19:17.959,There are slightly more pressing matters at hand here.
01:19:18.000,01:19:20.625,"Yeah, like the fact that Daffs is pointing a gun at my mum."
01:19:20.667,01:19:22.750,"I'm not the one who's being unreasonable, pickle."
01:19:22.792,01:19:24.208,"For Christ's sake, she's not dead!"
01:19:24.250,01:19:25.583,She's finished.
01:19:25.625,01:19:27.375,"For a hero, you're quite a hypocrite."
01:19:27.417,01:19:31.083,You're the one who's gone from being a chartered accountant to Charlton Heston.
01:19:31.125,01:19:32.875,I'm not a chartered accountant.
01:19:32.917,01:19:35.000,"- Well, you look like one."
01:19:35.041,01:19:37.166,- I'm a lecturer.
01:19:37.208,01:19:39.583,- Yeah!
01:19:39.625,01:19:41.917,In a minute she'll be just another zombie.
01:19:41.959,01:19:44.709,- Don't say that.
01:19:44.750,01:19:49.166,"Please, can we just calm the fuck down!"
01:19:50.667,01:19:54.250,Now I can see what David is trying to say.
01:19:54.291,01:19:56.750,"- Thank you, Lizzie."
01:19:56.792,01:19:57.917,Yep.
01:19:57.959,01:20:00.208,Liz: And Shaun...
01:20:00.250,01:20:01.625,"Shaun, look at me."
01:20:04.000,01:20:06.875,I can't begin to imagine how hard this must be for you.
01:20:08.291,01:20:11.542,But we can't afford to fall apart.
01:20:11.583,01:20:14.458,"Shaun, babe..."
01:20:14.500,01:20:16.667,I know you don't want to hear this...
01:20:35.750,01:20:37.125,You do it.
01:20:48.041,01:20:51.500,"I'm sorry, Mum."
01:20:51.542,01:20:52.917,Do it!
01:21:08.875,01:21:13.750,"Well... I think we're all agreed, you did the right thing there."
01:21:19.208,01:21:20.709,"David, no!"
01:21:22.792,01:21:24.375,David!
01:21:24.417,01:21:27.583,"- Right, I'm leaving."
01:21:27.625,01:21:30.709,- I'm not staying here.
01:21:30.750,01:21:32.291,- I think he should go.
01:21:32.333,01:21:33.667,We can run.
01:21:33.709,01:21:35.041,What do you mean we?
01:21:35.083,01:21:36.875,"What do you mean, what do I mean we?"
01:21:36.917,01:21:40.417,"Opening that door now would be a very, very silly thing to do."
01:21:40.458,01:21:42.875,- You gonna stay here with him?
01:21:40.458,01:21:45.458,"- Look, Shaun-- - After everything he's gotten us into - Let me finish!"
01:21:45.500,01:21:47.125,Shaun didn't ask you to come here.
01:21:47.166,01:21:50.291,You came for the same reason that I did-- because you didn't know what else to do.
01:21:50.333,01:21:52.125,Now get away from that door this instant!
01:21:52.166,01:21:54.041,- But-- - David!
01:22:02.667,01:22:04.709,"I'm so sorry, Dianne."
01:22:04.750,01:22:08.250,Maybe I'm not the one you should be apologizing to.
01:22:09.959,01:22:10.959,Shaun...
01:22:17.625,01:22:18.917,David!
01:22:18.959,01:22:20.166,No!
01:22:20.208,01:22:21.542,No! No! No!
01:22:21.583,01:22:23.750,No! No!
01:22:23.792,01:22:24.917,David!
01:22:24.959,01:22:28.542,- No! No!
01:22:49.291,01:22:52.083,David!
01:22:52.125,01:22:53.542,"Dianne, no!"
01:22:53.583,01:22:55.083,"I'm coming, David!"
01:22:58.709,01:23:00.166,Dianne: David!
01:23:01.959,01:23:03.625,"Oh, dear."
01:23:03.667,01:23:05.041,- Cocktails?
01:23:16.375,01:23:18.083,Stay back!
01:23:23.458,01:23:25.000,"Shaun, hold them!"
01:23:28.875,01:23:29.959,Heads!
01:23:34.250,01:23:37.458,- Ed!
01:23:37.500,01:23:40.333,"Shauny, look who it is."
01:23:40.375,01:23:42.792,Fuck-a-doodle-doo!
01:23:44.667,01:23:46.333,Ed!
01:23:46.375,01:23:47.875,- Shaun!
01:23:47.917,01:23:50.583,"Don't groan at me, you thick fuck!"
01:23:50.625,01:23:52.333,I can't hold them!
01:23:55.875,01:23:57.542,No!
01:24:01.500,01:24:02.959,- Shaun!
01:24:05.333,01:24:07.250,I said leave him alone!
01:24:10.375,01:24:12.250,Ed!
01:24:12.291,01:24:13.834,Ed!
01:24:13.875,01:24:15.458,"Shaun, bar!"
01:24:27.834,01:24:30.208,Ed!
01:24:30.250,01:24:31.458,Ed!
01:24:33.250,01:24:35.542,Ed!
01:24:35.583,01:24:37.709,What?
01:24:37.750,01:24:39.291,"Chuck us a cloth, will you?"
01:24:52.291,01:24:54.917,- Where are the shells?
01:24:54.959,01:24:55.959,"Oh, fuck!"
01:24:58.250,01:25:00.083,Ow!
01:25:00.125,01:25:02.583,Fuck it!
01:25:02.625,01:25:04.667,What are we gonna do?
01:25:04.709,01:25:06.333,- The cellar.
01:25:06.375,01:25:08.917,There's a barrel hatch that leads you to the street.
01:25:08.959,01:25:12.375,"What you mean, go back outside?"
01:25:12.417,01:25:14.834,"Oh, give us a fucking break!"
01:25:20.959,01:25:22.041,Go!
01:25:32.917,01:25:34.250,I can see the street.
01:25:36.542,01:25:37.542,Come on.
01:25:39.208,01:25:40.375,Come on!
01:25:42.000,01:25:43.709,Why won't it open?
01:25:54.667,01:25:57.000,"That's it then, isn't it?"
01:25:57.041,01:25:58.917,"Hey, let's go to the Winchester!"
01:25:58.959,01:26:01.000,Whose fucking idea was that?
01:26:01.041,01:26:03.000,"Man, I've really ballsed this up."
01:26:07.208,01:26:08.834,"- No, you haven't."
01:26:08.875,01:26:10.750,I couldn't save us.
01:26:10.792,01:26:12.208,I couldn't save Di or David.
01:26:12.250,01:26:14.375,I couldn't even save my mum.
01:26:14.417,01:26:15.834,I'm just-- I'm useless.
01:26:15.875,01:26:18.875,"You shouldn't feel so responsible, you tried."
01:26:18.917,01:26:23.417,"You did something, that's what counts."
01:26:23.458,01:26:25.083,"Yeah, I suppose."
01:26:28.125,01:26:30.792,Do you think they'll get through?
01:26:30.834,01:26:31.875,Yeah.
01:26:34.125,01:26:36.166,How many shells have we got left?
01:26:36.208,01:26:39.875,Um... two.
01:26:39.917,01:26:45.083,I suppose we could take a few of them out if they stand in a line.
01:26:45.125,01:26:47.667,I wasn't thinking about them.
01:26:47.709,01:26:48.750,I know.
01:26:53.375,01:26:55.583,What about Ed?
01:26:55.625,01:26:56.792,I don't mind being eaten.
01:27:02.250,01:27:04.500,How are we gonna do this?
01:27:04.542,01:27:07.375,"Uh, I don't know."
01:27:07.417,01:27:09.458,One of us has to go first.
01:27:09.500,01:27:12.333,Maybe one should do the other and then do themselves.
01:27:12.375,01:27:13.959,"Oh, maybe you should do me."
01:27:14.000,01:27:16.000,I'll only muck it up if I have to do myself.
01:27:25.208,01:27:30.458,"Do you know, I don't think I've got it in me to shoot my flat mate, my mum, and my girlfriend all in the same evening."
01:27:33.625,01:27:35.875,What makes you think I've taken you back?
01:27:35.917,01:27:38.125,Well...
01:27:38.166,01:27:40.875,"you don't want to die single, do you?"
01:27:40.917,01:27:42.709,Actually...
01:27:42.750,01:27:46.000,I would like to be shot.
01:27:46.041,01:27:47.583,"Besides, I've changed."
01:27:47.625,01:27:50.041,"I haven't had a fag since yesterday, I promise."
01:27:50.083,01:27:51.041,He hasn't.
01:27:53.542,01:27:55.500,Maybe we should have one now.
01:27:59.583,01:28:02.750,- You left them in my flat.
01:28:02.792,01:28:04.083,I was desperate.
01:28:04.125,01:28:06.083,Sneaky monkey.
01:28:06.125,01:28:08.458,- Sorry.
01:28:21.709,01:28:23.625,"Come on, we're getting out of here."
01:28:25.500,01:28:28.667,- I might just stay here.
01:28:28.709,01:28:30.458,I think you two should make a go of it.
01:28:30.500,01:28:32.125,What are you talking about?
01:28:32.166,01:28:34.125,I'll only hold you back.
01:28:34.166,01:28:35.500,"Yeah, but..."
01:28:40.875,01:28:43.750,Maybe you should have this.
01:28:43.792,01:28:45.542,Don't you want it?
01:28:45.583,01:28:47.125,No.
01:28:47.166,01:28:49.000,"I can't hit anything with it anyway, I'm rubbish."
01:28:52.333,01:28:54.583,"Ed, I'm sorry."
01:28:54.625,01:28:57.250,What for?
01:28:57.291,01:28:59.834,"'Cause, you know, I was shouting at you and that earlier on."
01:28:59.875,01:29:03.834,It's all right.
01:29:03.875,01:29:05.291,It's okay.
01:29:05.333,01:29:07.000,No...
01:29:07.041,01:29:08.417,"I'm sorry, Shaun."
01:29:11.542,01:29:15.667,"Oh, God!"
01:29:15.709,01:29:18.083,I'll stop doing 'em when you stop laughing.
01:29:18.125,01:29:20.333,I'm not laughing.
01:29:33.333,01:29:35.083,You'd better be off.
01:29:44.083,01:29:46.083,"Bye, Ed, love you."
01:29:47.875,01:29:50.417,Cheers.
01:29:50.458,01:29:52.000,"I love you too, man."
01:29:56.041,01:29:57.583,Gay.
01:30:18.166,01:30:20.542,- Ready?
01:30:30.375,01:30:32.750,"Man: Section one, ready!"
01:30:32.792,01:30:34.750,"Zombies to your front, fire!"
01:30:36.625,01:30:39.667,Section one... fire!
01:30:55.166,01:30:57.834,"Oh, my God! Shaun!"
01:30:57.875,01:30:59.166,Yvonne?
01:31:04.542,01:31:05.500,How are you doing?
01:31:05.542,01:31:07.500,Both: Surviving.
01:31:07.542,01:31:08.917,They're taking us somewhere safe.
01:31:08.959,01:31:12.125,I thought you two might want to tag along.
01:31:12.166,01:31:13.542,Is it just the two of you?
01:31:16.792,01:31:20.208,"Well, glad somebody made it."
01:31:22.125,01:31:23.208,Come on.
01:31:37.083,01:31:44.333,"Announcer: Next, we'll hear the story of 10-year-old Enrique Ramírez who fought off the reanimated corpses of his entire family."
01:31:44.375,01:31:48.041,It's all coming right up on Zombies From Hell.
01:31:48.083,01:31:52.542,"Man: Six months on, and to many the events of Z-Day must seem like a bad dream."
01:31:52.583,01:32:04.583,"And as we now know, the phenomenon resulted from the use of highly dea-- It's not something I ever expected as a newscaster to ever have to say on air-- removing the head or destroying the brain."
01:32:04.625,01:32:06.041,Incredible.
01:32:06.083,01:32:23.375,"Dead excited now to have a top band with us talking about their work for the charity Zombaid-- Woman: The fact that the mobile deceased retained their primal instincts make them ideal recruitment for the service industry, as well as proving themselves useful in other roles such as-- He can't quite get it."
01:32:23.417,01:32:27.125,"Ooh, he's fallen!"
01:32:27.166,01:32:33.000,"I don't see nothing wrong with it, but I know that some people would see something wrong with it, but he's my husband, you know."
01:32:33.041,01:32:34.625,I still love him.
01:32:34.667,01:32:36.834,"I've still got the ring on my finger, Trisha."
01:32:36.875,01:32:38.208,You go to bed with it?
01:32:40.875,01:32:43.917,"Okay, people can't understand why she's with him."
01:32:43.959,01:32:55.750,"Okay, what do you say to people that criticize you - for being with-- - Woman: Well, they don't have-- Man: Initial claims that the virus was caused by Eurasian infected monkeys have now been dismissed as bull-- Hello."
01:33:01.709,01:33:04.000,"What's the plan, then?"
01:33:04.041,01:33:07.125,"Right, a cup of tea..."
01:33:07.166,01:33:09.792,then we get the Sundays.
01:33:09.834,01:33:15.083,"Head down the Phoenix for a roast, veg out in the pub for a bit."
01:33:15.125,01:33:18.000,"then wander home, watch a bit of telly, go to bed."
01:33:18.041,01:33:21.041,- Per-fik.
01:33:21.083,01:33:25.333,"- Can I have two sugars, please?"
01:33:25.375,01:33:28.041,"Actually, I might pop into the garden for a bit."
01:33:28.083,01:33:29.750,"Go on, then."
01:33:29.792,01:33:31.291,Two seconds.
01:33:42.667,01:33:46.125,Man: Player two has entered the game.
01:33:46.166,01:33:48.083,- Ed!
01:33:55.542,01:33:57.000,Yes.
