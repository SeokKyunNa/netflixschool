00:03:21.417,00:03:23.792,I've come a long way from being the boy who was bit by a spider.
00:03:23.834,00:03:26.375,"Back then, nothing seemed to go right for me. Now..."
00:03:26.417,00:03:28.250,"Wow, look, it's Spider-Man!"
00:03:28.291,00:03:30.125,-Super cool!
00:03:30.166,00:03:32.250,People really like me.
00:03:32.291,00:03:35.166,"Hey, stick around."
00:03:35.208,00:03:37.542,-ALL: Nah.
00:03:39.041,00:03:40.959,The city is safe and sound.
00:03:41.000,00:03:43.041,I guess I've had something to do with that.
00:03:43.083,00:03:44.917,"My uncle, Ben, would be proud."
00:03:50.875,00:03:53.000,I still get to school.
00:03:53.041,00:03:59.250,"Now, the Hamiltonian shows us that the energy levels are perturbed by the electric field."
00:04:01.875,00:04:05.625,"From the form of this matrix, we can see..."
00:04:06.500,00:04:08.625,Miss Stacy?
00:04:08.667,00:04:12.125,That only the m equals zero quantum states are affected.
00:04:12.166,00:04:15.125,CONNORS: Correct.
00:04:19.125,00:04:22.458,Parker? You got something to add?
00:04:23.291,00:04:25.041,"No, sir."
00:04:27.208,00:04:31.500,And I'm in love with the girl of my dreams.
00:04:46.458,00:04:48.583,Hi.
00:04:48.625,00:04:52.959,Miss Watson left a ticket for me. Peter Parker.
00:04:54.041,00:04:55.834,Excuse me. Sorry.
00:04:55.875,00:04:58.291,Thank you. Sorry.
00:05:03.875,00:05:06.792,Oh. I'm so nervous.
00:05:30.375,00:05:32.792,That's my girlfriend.
00:06:46.834,00:06:49.291,-I thought she was good.
00:06:50.917,00:06:52.166,Harry?
00:06:52.208,00:06:53.834,Harry!
00:06:53.875,00:06:55.417,I need to talk to you.
00:06:56.375,00:06:58.208,Explain things.
00:07:00.250,00:07:03.792,Tell it to my father.
00:07:05.542,00:07:09.375,"I'm your friend, Harry."
00:07:18.417,00:07:19.542,M.J.!
00:07:19.583,00:07:22.125,-Peter!
00:07:22.166,00:07:24.500,-Was I good?
00:07:24.542,00:07:26.875,-You were...
00:07:26.917,00:07:30.875,"I love my flowers, they're beautiful."
00:07:30.917,00:07:34.959,-Was he here tonight?
00:07:35.000,00:07:38.000,-What's with you guys anyway?
00:07:38.041,00:07:40.458,Tell me again.
00:07:40.500,00:07:42.792,I was so nervous.
00:07:42.834,00:07:43.834,Your knees were fine.
00:07:43.875,00:07:45.667,The applause wasn't very loud.
00:07:45.709,00:07:47.583,"Yes, it was."
00:07:47.625,00:07:51.000,It's all about diffusion.
00:07:51.041,00:07:54.000,"You see, when the sound waves, they propagate, then it's like an..."
00:07:54.041,00:07:56.041,You are such a nerd.
00:08:42.709,00:08:44.625,-Wow.
00:08:49.000,00:08:50.917,Did you see that one?
00:09:00.083,00:09:03.250,-You know what?
00:09:03.291,00:09:09.375,I'd like to sing onstage for the rest of my life with you in the first row.
00:09:10.625,00:09:12.542,I'll be there.
00:09:14.542,00:09:16.709,Tell me you love me.
00:09:19.000,00:09:21.333,I love you.
00:09:21.375,00:09:23.542,I love you so much.
00:09:24.917,00:09:26.375,I always have.
00:10:14.166,00:10:15.542,-Ready?
00:12:11.208,00:12:13.834,"You can't hide here, Flint."
00:12:13.875,00:12:18.250,-I'm just here to see my daughter.
00:12:18.291,00:12:22.417,The cops are looking for you.
00:12:22.458,00:12:25.750,You're nothing but a common thief.
00:12:25.792,00:12:29.375,-You maybe even killed a man?
00:12:30.333,00:12:32.166,It wasn't.
00:12:32.208,00:12:34.417,I had good reason for what I was doing.
00:12:34.458,00:12:36.500,And that's the truth.
00:12:36.542,00:12:40.125,"EMMA: You and the truth, sitting in prison, having three meals a day together."
00:12:40.166,00:12:46.917,"I live in the presence of great truth, and that is the truth that you left behind right there in that bedroom."
00:13:01.417,00:13:03.208,Penny.
00:13:04.208,00:13:05.750,I missed you.
00:13:06.875,00:13:09.542,"I miss you too, Daddy."
00:13:20.500,00:13:24.208,I promise I'll make you healthy again.
00:13:24.250,00:13:27.333,"Whatever it takes, I'll get the money."
00:13:27.375,00:13:30.291,EMMA: You get out of here. Now.
00:13:41.709,00:13:43.041,I'm not a bad person.
00:13:45.542,00:13:47.625,Just had bad luck.
00:14:05.500,00:14:07.041,"Peter, what is it?"
00:14:08.959,00:14:10.041,It's M.J.
00:14:11.333,00:14:12.709,I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
00:14:12.750,00:14:14.834,"Oh, Peter."
00:14:14.875,00:14:17.250,Oh!
00:14:17.291,00:14:21.875,"The day your uncle, Ben, asked me to marry him, we were so scared."
00:14:21.917,00:14:23.875,And excited.
00:14:23.917,00:14:25.834,And very young.
00:14:25.875,00:14:28.917,And I loved him so fiercely.
00:14:28.959,00:14:31.291,"-And you said yes, right?"
00:14:31.333,00:14:33.750,"I wanted to say yes, but I said no."
00:14:33.792,00:14:36.667,I wasn't ready.
00:14:36.709,00:14:39.250,So we took our time.
00:14:39.291,00:14:41.667,Looked forward to it.
00:14:41.709,00:14:45.291,Didn't want to run into something with nothing to count on but love.
00:14:46.792,00:14:52.834,A man has to be understanding and put his wife before himself.
00:14:53.709,00:14:56.250,"Can you do that, Peter?"
00:14:57.750,00:15:00.667,"Yeah, I think I can."
00:15:00.709,00:15:05.333,Then you have my blessing.
00:15:05.375,00:15:09.417,Oh. I hope you've considered a proper proposal.
00:15:09.458,00:15:12.834,Your uncle had it all planned.
00:15:12.875,00:15:14.917,He took me to the beach one Sunday.
00:15:14.959,00:15:17.917,"Oh, he was a knockout in his bathing suit."
00:15:17.959,00:15:20.667,And I didn't look too bad myself.
00:15:20.709,00:15:22.792,We were very good swimmers.
00:15:22.834,00:15:27.625,"And it was a beautiful day and he said, Let's swim to the island."
00:15:27.667,00:15:36.834,"And at the island, we found a perfect spot by an old tree and we lay down and looked up at the sky."
00:15:36.875,00:15:40.375,"And then he said, Close your eyes, May."
00:15:40.417,00:15:43.333,"And I did. And then he said, Open them."
00:15:43.375,00:15:45.333,And I did.
00:15:45.375,00:15:48.125,And he was holding this ring.
00:15:49.542,00:15:52.875,"Dazzling, in front of me."
00:15:55.333,00:15:57.667,I thought it was the sun.
00:16:00.000,00:16:06.667,"We'd be married 50 years, come August, if..."
00:16:13.083,00:16:14.375,So...
00:16:16.375,00:16:22.500,I hope you'll make it very special for Mary Jane.
00:16:22.542,00:16:25.542,Do something she'll never forget.
00:16:28.542,00:16:30.083,Give her this.
00:16:31.875,00:16:34.500,Go on. Take it.
00:17:51.667,00:17:52.709,Harry.
00:17:52.750,00:17:54.166,"You knew this was coming, Pete."
00:17:57.875,00:18:00.500,Listen to me.
00:18:02.166,00:18:04.500,He was trying to kill me.
00:18:04.542,00:18:06.125,Shut up!
00:19:48.166,00:19:50.625,"HARRY: I'm still here, Peter."
00:20:14.583,00:20:15.583,Hate those things.
00:20:58.959,00:21:00.333,HARRY: Oh!
00:21:15.250,00:21:16.834,Harry?
00:21:20.834,00:21:22.166,Harry.
00:21:23.208,00:21:24.834,Harry!
00:21:29.709,00:21:31.667,"Oh, my God."
00:21:37.875,00:21:39.542,Harry!
00:21:41.709,00:21:43.375,Come on!
00:21:46.125,00:21:47.875,God.
00:21:51.625,00:21:52.834,-NURSE 1: Defib.
00:21:52.875,00:21:54.667,DOCTOR: And clear.
00:21:54.709,00:21:56.125,No response.
00:21:56.166,00:21:58.125,"-Recharge, let's go again."
00:21:58.166,00:22:00.750,-Charging.
00:22:00.792,00:22:02.709,NURSE 3: No response.
00:22:02.750,00:22:05.125,DOCTOR: Let's recharge and do it one more time. And clear.
00:22:10.875,00:22:13.083,Captain Stacy.
00:22:13.125,00:22:14.417,What's this?
00:22:14.458,00:22:16.834,The guy we tied to the Ben Parker homicide.
00:22:16.875,00:22:18.834,-What about him?
00:22:18.875,00:22:20.375,-And?
00:22:20.417,00:22:22.000,He's in the marshlands.
00:22:26.750,00:22:27.834,There he is!
00:22:47.166,00:22:50.041,"POLICEMAN: You two, take the west side."
00:22:54.166,00:22:55.166,Where'd he go?
00:23:18.208,00:23:20.041,-Capacitors charged?
00:23:20.083,00:23:22.166,"Donnie, we got a little fluctuation on one."
00:23:22.208,00:23:23.875,There's a change in the silicon mass.
00:23:23.917,00:23:26.083,"Yeah, it's probably a bird."
00:23:26.125,00:23:27.792,Initiating demolecularization.
00:24:57.959,00:25:00.083,-How is he?
00:25:00.125,00:25:02.458,But there's been some memory impairment.
00:25:02.500,00:25:04.709,Particularly his short-term memory.
00:25:04.750,00:25:09.000,Right now he can't remember the accident or anything that happened to him recently.
00:25:09.041,00:25:10.333,Is it permanent?
00:25:10.375,00:25:13.875,It could be.
00:25:13.917,00:25:15.333,He's awake if you wanna see him.
00:25:15.375,00:25:17.500,Oh. Maybe I should wait.
00:25:17.542,00:25:21.000,"Oh, it's fine."
00:25:40.208,00:25:41.417,"Hey, buddy."
00:25:42.166,00:25:43.500,Hey.
00:25:44.250,00:25:46.000,Hit my head.
00:25:46.041,00:25:47.625,Yeah.
00:25:47.667,00:25:50.208,Doctor said I was in an accident.
00:25:50.250,00:25:52.041,Hit-and-run.
00:25:52.083,00:25:54.542,I don't remember much of anything.
00:25:56.125,00:25:57.667,My father...
00:25:58.375,00:25:59.709,"He died, right?"
00:26:02.166,00:26:04.542,This is all so weird.
00:26:05.792,00:26:09.375,Hi.
00:26:09.417,00:26:10.458,I know that face.
00:26:11.041,00:26:12.333,How you doing?
00:26:12.375,00:26:13.834,I don't know.
00:26:13.875,00:26:16.333,"Last thing I remember, I was fine."
00:26:16.375,00:26:18.083,Somewhere.
00:26:18.125,00:26:19.375,MARY JANE: You're still fine.
00:26:20.750,00:26:22.417,"We love you, Harry."
00:26:23.417,00:26:29.667,It feels like somehow I've been gone for a really long time.
00:26:31.375,00:26:33.583,And now I'm back home.
00:26:33.625,00:26:36.667,It's good to have you back.
00:26:36.709,00:26:40.125,"I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask you guys to scoot, okay?"
00:26:40.166,00:26:42.500,-Okay.
00:26:42.542,00:26:44.625,"Well, I'll see you tomorrow."
00:26:44.667,00:26:46.709,Yeah. Great.
00:26:47.500,00:26:49.041,MARY JANE: Get some sleep.
00:26:52.542,00:26:55.208,-I think he's gonna be fine.
00:26:55.250,00:26:57.959,-And you guys seem great.
00:27:01.125,00:27:02.583,You have lovely friends.
00:27:03.125,00:27:05.417,My best friends.
00:27:07.542,00:27:09.709,I'd give my life for them.
00:30:19.417,00:30:21.417,-Yeah?
00:30:21.458,00:30:23.500,Oh! Hey.
00:30:24.667,00:30:26.625,"Peter, you know I can't open the door."
00:30:26.667,00:30:28.542,It's stuck again?
00:30:28.583,00:30:30.750,Just come on and help me.
00:30:30.792,00:30:32.208,I'm coming.
00:30:38.625,00:30:40.208,-Hey.
00:30:40.250,00:30:41.500,Oh!
00:30:41.542,00:30:43.417,They hated it. They hated me.
00:30:43.458,00:30:44.834,"Well, they can't hate you."
00:30:44.875,00:30:49.500,"The young Miss Watson is a pretty girl, easy on the eyes, but not on the ears."
00:30:49.542,00:30:52.375,Her small voice didn't carry past the first row.
00:30:52.417,00:30:54.333,"That's ridiculous, I was right there."
00:30:54.375,00:30:56.291,You were in the first row.
00:30:56.333,00:30:59.750,"Yeah, but that's..."
00:30:59.792,00:31:04.166,That's a critic. This is something you're gonna have to get used to.
00:31:04.208,00:31:08.000,"Believe me, I know."
00:31:08.041,00:31:11.667,This isn't about you.
00:31:11.709,00:31:16.166,"I know, and I'm just saying you can't let it bring you down."
00:31:16.208,00:31:18.500,You just gotta believe in yourself and you pull yourself together.
00:31:18.542,00:31:19.750,You get right back on the horse and...
00:31:19.792,00:31:22.166,Don't give me the horse thing.
00:31:22.208,00:31:24.542,Try and understand how I feel.
00:31:29.750,00:31:31.500,It's just...
00:31:34.458,00:31:39.834,"I look at these words, and it's like my father wrote them."
00:31:42.834,00:31:45.333,"All cars in the vicinity of 54th and 6th Avenue, please report."
00:31:45.375,00:31:47.875,"Crane out of control, approach with caution."
00:31:51.291,00:31:52.291,"Go get 'em, Tiger?"
00:31:55.291,00:31:56.792,I'm sorry.
00:32:29.875,00:32:32.500,"Oh, my God."
00:32:32.542,00:32:35.417,That crane job you sent us on.
00:32:35.458,00:32:37.875,We're gonna need a major mobilization right away.
00:32:44.792,00:32:48.583,Shut it down at the generator. Now!
00:32:51.959,00:32:55.166,"Okay, Gwen, I've got a secret."
00:32:58.542,00:33:01.208,What is that thing doing in my background?
00:33:26.208,00:33:29.667,"Captain Stacy, they got some kind of short up there. They can't shut down the crane."
00:33:29.709,00:33:32.750,Get Edison on the phone.
00:33:36.458,00:33:37.834,Are you all right?
00:33:37.875,00:33:39.500,It's coming back.
00:33:41.458,00:33:42.542,"Oh, no."
00:34:06.125,00:34:09.083,"-Oh, my God. That's Gwen."
00:34:14.458,00:34:16.542,What's she doing up there?
00:34:16.583,00:34:18.834,"I don't know, I just saw her last night. She said she had a modeling gig."
00:34:18.875,00:34:21.875,-Who are you?
00:34:21.917,00:34:23.709,And I work at the Daily Bugle.

00:35:27.625,00:35:30.333,"Hey, Spidey, hold on."
00:35:30.375,00:35:32.041,-Thank God you're okay.
00:35:32.083,00:35:34.041,Hey. I'm the new guy.

00:35:36.792,00:35:38.792,You okay?
00:35:38.834,00:35:41.083,"From now on, I am gonna be taking shots of you for the Bugle."
00:35:41.125,00:35:44.166,So smile. Are you smiling?
00:35:44.208,00:35:46.250,-They got a guy!
00:35:46.291,00:35:51.500,"Um, yeah, look, just between you and me, guy's kind of an amateur."
00:35:51.542,00:35:54.208,Have you noticed his stuff makes you look a little bloated?
00:35:54.250,00:35:56.959,"Just... Yeah, a little chunky."
00:35:57.000,00:35:59.166,Okay.
00:35:59.208,00:36:00.875,"But you don't have to worry about that anymore, buddy."
00:36:10.500,00:36:11.542,JAMESON: Dazzle me.
00:36:15.875,00:36:19.208,Pow. Zap.
00:36:19.250,00:36:22.208,Just a little something the boys in the ad department and I whipped up.
00:36:22.250,00:36:25.500,"As you know, circulation at the Bugle's been pretty good."
00:36:25.542,00:36:27.583,Though not as good as the New York Times.
00:36:27.625,00:36:30.208,"Or the Daily News, or the Post, or several other smaller..."
00:36:30.250,00:36:31.291,"Get on with it, you moron!"
00:36:32.959,00:36:34.500,-What?
00:36:34.542,00:36:36.667,Your wife told me to tell you to watch the anger.
00:36:36.709,00:36:37.959,You tell my wife...
00:36:41.625,00:36:43.291,Thank you.
00:36:45.125,00:36:48.250,HOFFMAN: So I propose this campaign.
00:36:48.291,00:36:50.959,Daily Bugle. That's obvious.
00:36:51.000,00:36:55.000,"It's hip, it's now."
00:36:55.041,00:36:57.750,It's wow. That's actually Erickson. He goes crazy.
00:36:57.792,00:37:02.166,"We gave him a couple lattes, And how. That's me again."
00:37:03.917,00:37:05.834,Time to take your pill.
00:37:07.000,00:37:08.583,Not that one.
00:37:09.709,00:37:10.959,Not that one.
00:37:19.333,00:37:20.959,Drink plenty of water.
00:37:25.333,00:37:26.917,Thank you.
00:37:29.166,00:37:30.709,Continue.
00:37:33.834,00:37:35.208,-He's busy.
00:37:35.250,00:37:36.834,"I'm just here to talk to you, beautiful."
00:37:36.875,00:37:38.667,What's that smell?
00:37:38.709,00:37:41.834,That's a little something called Nice and Easy.
00:37:41.875,00:37:43.917,It's called Go Away.
00:37:43.959,00:37:46.667,"Get out! That is the dumbest idea you've ever had, and you have had some doozies."
00:37:46.709,00:37:48.959,Blood pressure!
00:37:49.000,00:37:52.250,"Hey, where are you going?"
00:37:52.291,00:37:54.959,-Who are you?
00:37:55.000,00:37:58.041,-I did? What's that smell?
00:37:58.083,00:38:00.458,-Who? What?
00:38:00.500,00:38:02.000,"Here, it's the crane accident."
00:38:02.041,00:38:03.834,-Check out the light source.
00:38:03.875,00:38:05.083,"-Hey, Betty."
00:38:05.125,00:38:07.166,You better get in there.
00:38:07.208,00:38:09.083,He's trying to sell some Spidey photos.
00:38:09.125,00:38:10.709,Oh.
00:38:11.333,00:38:13.250,Thanks.
00:38:13.291,00:38:16.166,"Parker. You're late, maybe too late."
00:38:16.208,00:38:17.959,"It's Brock, sir."
00:38:18.000,00:38:20.333,-But I got you this.
00:38:20.375,00:38:23.083,"Wait, how'd you get that?"
00:38:23.125,00:38:26.000,-Climbed.
00:38:26.041,00:38:28.959,-Which one do we use?
00:38:29.000,00:38:30.875,-It's better.
00:38:30.917,00:38:33.083,"Congratulations, son, we'll use your shot."
00:38:33.125,00:38:35.166,"All right, J.J., I'm your man."
00:38:35.208,00:38:37.834,I know more about what makes a good picture than any photographer in this town.
00:38:37.875,00:38:41.750,"See, photography, it's not just about, no offense, flagpoles or whatever."
00:38:41.792,00:38:44.000,It's about lighting.
00:38:44.875,00:38:46.166,"I want a staff job, sir."
00:38:46.208,00:38:56.125,"I have a girl that I intend to marry and I guess, I don't know, I have this stupid little dream of working with one of the greatest newspaper editors of our time."
00:38:56.959,00:38:58.208,J. Jonah Jameson.
00:39:01.750,00:39:04.667,"Well, we do have an opening."
00:39:04.709,00:39:06.834,-You fired him.
00:39:06.875,00:39:08.834,Wait a minute. I know what makes a good picture and I've been here a long time.
00:39:08.875,00:39:11.291,"If there's a staff job, Mr. Jameson, I think I deserve it."
00:39:11.333,00:39:15.542,"He's right, Jonah. Peter's been with us for years."
00:39:15.583,00:39:17.333,"You want a staff job, and you want a staff job."
00:39:17.375,00:39:19.333,-Anybody care about what I want?
00:39:19.375,00:39:21.667,Shut up. Get out.
00:39:21.709,00:39:25.000,I want the public to see Spider-Man for the two-bit criminal he really is.
00:39:25.041,00:39:29.291,"He's a fake, he's full of stickum."
00:39:29.333,00:39:31.834,Spider-Man with his hand in a cookie jar.
00:39:31.875,00:39:33.959,Whoever brings me that photo gets a job.
00:39:34.000,00:39:35.875,"What are you waiting for, Chinese New Year? Go, go, go."
00:39:35.917,00:39:37.250,"I'm on it, boss."
00:39:38.959,00:39:40.166,You'll never get that shot.
00:39:40.208,00:39:41.375,"Oh, we'll see."
00:39:56.208,00:40:01.208,"You know, I guess one person can make a difference."
00:40:02.875,00:40:04.500,Enough said.
00:40:09.834,00:40:12.208,"Welcome home, Harry."
00:40:13.083,00:40:15.333,Thank God you're all right.
00:40:15.375,00:40:16.458,"Thanks, Bernard."
00:40:16.500,00:40:17.750,-Bernard.
00:40:20.875,00:40:23.250,Got you a little homecoming present.
00:40:24.333,00:40:26.166,-HARRY: It's your old ball.
00:40:26.208,00:40:28.083,"Thanks, buddy."
00:40:28.125,00:40:30.417,"Hey, we were pretty good in the back yard, weren't we?"
00:40:30.458,00:40:34.375,We were terrible.
00:40:34.417,00:40:36.250,-For the cheerleaders.
00:40:36.291,00:40:38.166,"Hey, do I have any girlfriends?"
00:40:38.208,00:40:39.250,I don't know.
00:40:39.291,00:40:41.000,You don't?
00:40:41.041,00:40:43.834,"Hey, Bernard."
00:40:43.875,00:40:46.291,"Not that I know of, sir."
00:40:51.875,00:40:53.500,"It's a pretty cool pad, huh?"
00:40:53.542,00:40:55.375,It's okay.
00:40:55.417,00:40:58.500,-Looks like I'm not hurting for money.
00:40:58.542,00:41:02.375,"Well, maybe I can turn this no-girlfriend thing around."
00:41:10.000,00:41:15.417,"You know, he always appreciated how you helped me through high school."
00:41:15.458,00:41:19.500,Just wish I could remember more about him.
00:41:19.542,00:41:24.208,"Well, he loved you."
00:41:24.250,00:41:28.875,"Hey, let's watch a game in the kitchen. Get something to eat."
00:41:28.917,00:41:29.959,Okay.
00:41:31.208,00:41:32.333,"Whoa, heads up."
00:41:36.041,00:41:37.959,Did you see that?
00:41:38.000,00:41:40.041,-Still got the moves.
00:42:13.750,00:42:14.875,DIRECTOR: Why are we stopping?
00:42:19.083,00:42:20.500,What is she doing here?
00:42:20.542,00:42:22.083,"PRODUCER: Well, Gary was supposed to call her agent."
00:42:24.875,00:42:27.500,"Hi, honey."
00:42:27.542,00:42:29.291,I'm sorry.
00:42:29.333,00:42:30.667,One critic?
00:42:30.709,00:42:32.875,"PRODUCER: No, all the papers, dear."
00:42:32.917,00:42:35.333,"Mary Jane, honey, sit down."
00:42:35.375,00:42:37.959,"Listen, if you'd like, we could say you became ill."
00:42:49.083,00:42:51.166,That was so poorly handled.
00:42:51.208,00:42:53.166,Yeah.
00:42:53.208,00:42:54.959,Let's just rehearse.
00:43:00.625,00:43:03.083,"MAN: All right, Spidey."
00:43:41.125,00:43:43.417,Spidey! Spidey! Spidey!
00:43:43.458,00:43:47.125,"Excuse me, miss?"
00:43:47.166,00:43:49.166,"Hi, Eddie."
00:43:49.208,00:43:52.208,You're so beautiful.
00:43:52.250,00:43:54.166,"Okay, I've gotta practice."
00:43:54.208,00:43:56.291,-How about tonight?
00:43:56.333,00:43:58.000,Why not?
00:43:58.041,00:44:02.041,"What about that amazing, amazing night that we had?"
00:44:03.166,00:44:05.250,"We had coffee, Eddie."
00:44:06.250,00:44:07.542,"PETER: Hey, beautiful."
00:44:08.542,00:44:09.959,One more.
00:44:13.375,00:44:15.917,-Everything okay?
00:44:15.959,00:44:17.375,"You're not still mad at me, are you?"
00:44:17.417,00:44:19.959,"No, Peter, I'm proud of you."
00:44:20.000,00:44:22.417,"Hey, I'm gonna be swinging in from over there."
00:44:22.458,00:44:24.542,"-Oh, yeah?"
00:44:26.208,00:44:28.333,Give them a good show.
00:44:28.375,00:44:30.291,Don't worry about that review.
00:44:30.333,00:44:33.458,"We're gonna be laughing about it tomorrow night, I promise."
00:44:33.500,00:44:34.709,Yeah.
00:44:51.875,00:44:53.542,Isn't that that guy from that prison break?
00:44:54.667,00:44:56.291,POLICEMAN: He fits.
00:44:56.333,00:44:58.750,"Hey, you. Halt!"
00:44:59.583,00:45:01.291,Cover the back.
00:45:04.709,00:45:07.166,"-WOMAN: Hon, be careful."
00:45:55.458,00:45:56.625,POLICEMAN 1: He's in the truck!
00:45:56.667,00:45:58.667,POLICEMAN 2: Round the front!
00:46:11.709,00:46:13.375,Fire.
00:46:37.083,00:46:44.500,"People of the city of New York, I am here today because I fell 62 stories and someone caught me."
00:46:44.542,00:46:47.959,Someone who never asks for anything in return.
00:46:48.000,00:46:51.500,Someone who doesn't even want us to know who he is.
00:46:51.542,00:46:52.709,"Hey, M.J."
00:46:52.750,00:46:54.291,-Harry!
00:46:55.375,00:46:57.500,-Where's Pete?
00:46:57.542,00:46:59.750,"-Taking somebody's picture, I guess."
00:46:59.792,00:47:02.709,I'm so happy to see you.
00:47:02.750,00:47:04.333,I've never felt better.
00:47:04.375,00:47:06.542,"It's a weird feeling, not knowing who you are."
00:47:06.583,00:47:09.542,"Bump on the head, I'm as free as a bird."
00:47:09.583,00:47:11.792,-Will you bump me on the head?
00:47:13.917,00:47:16.458,"Hey, Pete said you're in a play."
00:47:16.500,00:47:19.125,You came. You sent me flowers.
00:47:19.166,00:47:21.750,I did? I'll come again tonight.
00:47:22.458,00:47:25.625,You can't. I was let go.
00:47:25.667,00:47:27.417,What happened?
00:47:28.917,00:47:30.417,I wasn't very good.
00:47:31.959,00:47:36.333,"You know, this is embarrassing, but I once wrote you a play in high school."
00:47:36.375,00:47:38.500,-You wrote me a play?
00:47:38.542,00:47:40.291,"Harry, that's the sweetest thing."
00:47:40.333,00:47:53.208,"So I ask you, when you're dropping without a parachute, or your store's being robbed, or your house is on fire, who is it that breaks your fall, puts out the flames and saves your children?"
00:47:53.250,00:47:55.166,ALL: Spider-Man!
00:47:55.208,00:47:57.291,They love me.
00:47:57.333,00:48:01.750,"Then let's hear it for your one and only, friendly neighborhood..."
00:48:01.792,00:48:03.458,ALL: Spider-Man!
00:48:16.458,00:48:19.625,SPIDER-MAN: Hey. What's up? All right.
00:48:21.333,00:48:23.417,Shazam!
00:48:23.458,00:48:26.166,"Whoo-hoo! Hey, guys."
00:48:26.208,00:48:28.250,Spider-Man! Spider-Man!
00:48:28.291,00:48:30.458,"SPIDER-MAN: Hey, there. Hi."
00:48:32.291,00:48:33.500,-Kiss him!
00:48:34.875,00:48:36.375,-Kiss him!
00:48:37.542,00:48:39.250,"Go ahead, lay one on me."
00:48:39.291,00:48:40.834,-Really?
00:48:40.875,00:48:42.542,-Kiss her!
00:48:42.583,00:48:44.333,"No, Spider-Man, no!"
00:48:44.375,00:48:46.041,All right.
00:48:54.834,00:48:57.625,Hope Pete's getting a shot of this.
00:49:01.208,00:49:02.959,Ack!
00:49:03.000,00:49:04.959,"Hey, hey, are you okay?"
00:49:05.000,00:49:06.500,"Yeah, I'm fine."
00:49:52.375,00:49:53.959,"Hey, man, we got something on the roof."
00:49:58.625,00:50:00.000,GUARD: Oh!
00:50:17.375,00:50:19.083,"Jig's up, pal."
00:50:19.125,00:50:21.875,I don't wanna hurt you.
00:50:21.917,00:50:25.166,I guess you haven't heard.
00:50:25.625,00:50:26.917,Okay.
00:50:30.417,00:50:31.709,Uh-oh.
00:51:05.417,00:51:06.792,DRIVER: Help!
00:51:41.166,00:51:43.792,Where do all these guys come from?
00:52:37.250,00:52:38.834,"I'm sorry, I don't speak..."
00:52:38.875,00:52:43.000,"But this is a French restaurant, non?"
00:52:43.041,00:52:45.083,-Oui?
00:52:45.125,00:52:47.500,"-Name, please?"
00:52:51.208,00:52:53.417,Ah. Here we are.
00:52:53.458,00:52:55.500,Table for two. Pecker.
00:52:56.875,00:52:58.834,-Parker.
00:52:59.291,00:53:00.291,Pecker.
00:53:03.208,00:53:05.500,"Um, I have a request."
00:53:05.542,00:53:08.542,My girlfriend will be coming and I have this ring.
00:53:08.583,00:53:10.834,Ah!
00:53:15.125,00:53:16.834,Hello.
00:53:16.875,00:53:19.834,"Oh, so you want to pop the question tonight, huh?"
00:53:19.875,00:53:22.917,"Yes, and I wanna do something very special."
00:53:22.959,00:53:25.625,I love it. Romance.
00:53:25.667,00:53:29.083,I am French.
00:53:29.125,00:53:32.667,"When I signal you, if you'd bring some champagne with the ring..."
00:53:32.709,00:53:35.000,-In the bottom of her glass?
00:53:36.250,00:53:42.166,"Also, I thought at the same time if the musicians would play this song..."
00:53:43.208,00:53:45.750,Their favorite.
00:53:45.792,00:53:48.208,And take good care of the ring.
00:53:48.250,00:53:51.750,"Oui, with my life, monsieur."
00:53:53.917,00:53:55.166,I like you.
00:53:58.750,00:54:00.166,Thank you.
00:54:07.917,00:54:09.583,Oh.
00:54:11.375,00:54:14.125,"Okay, so..."
00:54:14.166,00:54:16.625,"Oh, would you like some champagne?"
00:54:20.166,00:54:22.208,How'd that get in there?
00:54:23.709,00:54:25.875,"Oh, don't cry."
00:54:30.959,00:54:32.041,Hi.
00:54:33.083,00:54:35.208,Look at you.
00:54:35.250,00:54:36.917,Thanks.
00:54:41.083,00:54:42.834,This place in your budget?
00:54:42.875,00:54:45.041,"Well, it's a special occasion."
00:54:45.875,00:54:47.250,You're on Broadway.
00:54:48.750,00:54:50.834,I don't feel like much of a star tonight.
00:54:50.875,00:54:54.125,"Well, you are a star."
00:54:54.834,00:54:59.667,"Peter, you have no idea how I feel right now."
00:54:59.709,00:55:03.083,"Oh, no, I know exactly how you feel."
00:55:03.125,00:55:07.333,"Listen, I have been through this."
00:55:07.375,00:55:12.208,"I see Spider-Man posters in the window, kids running around with me on their sweaters..."
00:55:12.250,00:55:14.083,Big Halloween item.
00:55:14.125,00:55:17.125,"I don't know, I guess I've become something of an icon."
00:55:17.166,00:55:22.625,"Like yesterday, they kept screaming, Spider-Man, Spider-Man."
00:55:22.667,00:55:30.166,"I don't know, you know, I mean, I'm thinking to myself, I'm just a nerdy kid from Queens. Do I deserve this?"
00:55:32.250,00:55:33.542,"Hi, Pete."
00:55:34.000,00:55:35.041,Hi.
00:55:42.709,00:55:44.792,Hi. My parents and I were just having dinner here.
00:55:44.834,00:55:45.959,Oh.
00:55:46.000,00:55:48.792,-Hello. I'm Gwen Stacy.
00:55:48.834,00:55:51.333,This is Mary Jane Watson.
00:55:51.375,00:55:56.583,"Oh! Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you. Pete talks about you all the time."
00:55:56.625,00:55:57.625,Oh?
00:55:58.834,00:56:02.875,Gwen is my lab partner in Dr. Connors' class.
00:56:02.917,00:56:06.417,Pete's something of a genius.
00:56:06.458,00:56:14.000,"Which actually reminds me, Pete, if you've got a picture of my kiss with Spider-Man, could you bring it to class?"
00:56:14.041,00:56:18.291,I'd really love it.
00:56:18.333,00:56:21.291,"After all, who gets kissed by Spider-Man, right?"
00:56:22.041,00:56:23.709,I can't imagine.
00:56:25.041,00:56:28.458,"Well, it was lovely to meet you."
00:56:28.500,00:56:30.208,-Good night.
00:56:41.375,00:56:43.417,"Oh, she's in my science class."
00:56:43.458,00:56:45.375,It's not her best subject.
00:56:47.959,00:56:49.125,What?
00:56:49.166,00:56:51.375,How come you never mentioned her?
00:56:52.875,00:56:55.333,She's your lab partner?
00:56:55.375,00:56:57.792,You saved her life?
00:56:57.834,00:57:01.875,She thinks you're a genius and she had her polished fingernails all over you?
00:57:02.667,00:57:04.083,Or didn't you notice?
00:57:05.917,00:57:09.041,And she gave Spider-Man the key to the city.
00:57:10.250,00:57:12.125,I'll never forget that.
00:57:16.000,00:57:17.417,She's just a girl in my class.
00:57:17.458,00:57:19.625,Let me ask you something.
00:57:19.667,00:57:24.166,"When you kissed her, who was kissing her?"
00:57:24.208,00:57:26.959,Spider-Man or Peter?
00:57:27.000,00:57:28.083,What do you mean?
00:57:28.125,00:57:30.166,You know exactly what I mean.
00:57:30.208,00:57:31.667,That was our kiss.
00:57:32.583,00:57:35.125,Why would you do that?
00:57:35.166,00:57:38.834,You must have known how it'd make me feel.
00:57:38.875,00:57:40.542,Do you wanna push me away?
00:57:40.583,00:57:42.333,Push you away?
00:57:42.375,00:57:45.125,Why would I wanna push you away? I love you.
00:57:45.166,00:57:49.125,You're my girlfriend.
00:57:50.500,00:57:52.375,I don't feel very well.
00:57:52.959,00:57:55.500,No...
00:57:55.542,00:57:58.333,-Where are you going?
00:58:01.875,00:58:03.291,MAITRE D': Here we are.
00:58:39.875,00:58:42.917,"Hi, it's M.J. Sing your song at the beep. Beep!"
00:58:44.333,00:58:48.333,Hello. Uh...
00:58:48.375,00:58:52.250,"I wish you'd pick up the phone. I don't know what's going on, or..."
00:58:52.291,00:58:55.875,I don't know if you got the messages or what.
00:58:55.917,00:58:56.917,"But, uh..."
00:58:58.208,00:59:00.041,I just wanna talk to you.
00:59:02.208,00:59:04.500,"Okay, call me. Bye."
00:59:16.041,00:59:17.750,-Hello?
00:59:17.792,00:59:19.291,Yeah?
00:59:19.333,00:59:21.333,This is Detective Neil Garrett from the 32nd Precinct.
00:59:21.375,00:59:23.458,I'm calling on behalf of Captain Stacy.
00:59:23.500,00:59:26.333,He would like you to come down to the station to speak with him.
00:59:26.375,00:59:32.041,"STACY: Originally, we thought that this man, Dennis Carradine, was your husband's killer."
00:59:32.083,00:59:33.625,We were wrong.
00:59:34.208,00:59:35.417,What?
00:59:35.458,00:59:38.375,Turns out Mr. Carradine was only an accomplice.
00:59:38.417,00:59:40.959,The actual killer is still at large.
00:59:41.000,00:59:42.583,What are you talking about?
00:59:42.625,00:59:45.125,This is the man who killed your husband.
00:59:50.333,00:59:51.834,His name is Flint Marko.
00:59:51.875,00:59:54.667,He's a small-time crook who's been in and out of prison.
00:59:54.709,00:59:56.333,You got this wrong.
00:59:56.375,00:59:58.500,Two days ago he escaped.
00:59:58.542,01:00:05.208,"Evidently, he confessed his guilt to a cellmate, and we have a couple of witnesses who will corroborate the story."
01:00:17.375,01:00:19.291,"No, wait, son."
01:00:23.208,01:00:24.417,No!
01:00:33.417,01:00:35.959,"Hey, get in!"
01:00:54.959,01:00:56.917,"Would you put these photos away, please?"
01:00:56.959,01:00:59.125,"I'm sorry, Mrs. Parker."
01:00:56.959,01:01:02.083,"I know this isn't easy, but, please, be patient with us."
01:01:02.125,01:01:04.000,We're doing our job.
01:01:04.041,01:01:05.750,"No, you're not doing your job."
01:01:05.792,01:01:08.500,"I watched my uncle die, and we chased down the wrong man."
01:01:08.542,01:01:11.834,Now you're telling me you had suspicions for two years? Witnesses?
01:01:11.875,01:01:14.208,-Why weren't we told about this?
01:01:14.250,01:01:16.000,I have no intention of settling down.
01:01:16.041,01:01:18.500,"This man killed my uncle, and he's still out there!"
01:01:27.834,01:01:29.333,L-20 Parkway.
01:01:29.375,01:01:32.375,"All officers in the vicinity, please report."
01:01:32.417,01:01:36.208,We have an abandoned vehicle and an elderly man in the middle of the street.
01:01:36.250,01:01:37.792,"Sorry, Wabash Avenue."
01:01:41.750,01:01:43.000,"Peter, it's M.J."
01:01:44.792,01:01:46.625,I'm not here about what happened at dinner.
01:01:46.667,01:01:47.834,Just please open up.
01:01:55.417,01:01:58.000,Aunt May called me.
01:01:58.041,01:01:59.583,She's worried about you.
01:02:00.542,01:02:02.166,I'm worried about you.
01:02:02.208,01:02:04.291,Don't be. I'm fine.
01:02:04.333,01:02:06.333,I don't want you to do something stupid.
01:02:06.375,01:02:08.834,Like try to find my uncle's killer?
01:02:08.875,01:02:11.500,And do something you'll regret.
01:02:11.542,01:02:15.166,Like with that other guy.
01:02:15.208,01:02:18.333,He had a gun on me.
01:02:18.375,01:02:19.834,I'm not accusing you of anything.
01:02:19.875,01:02:21.834,"10-22, auto at 556..."
01:02:21.875,01:02:25.834,-Will you turn that thing off?
01:02:25.875,01:02:30.875,"MAN 2: Yeah, Central, this is Car 3-9 responding to your 6th Avenue call."
01:02:30.917,01:02:34.542,"Peter, I'm here because I care about you."
01:02:34.583,01:02:41.667,"And I know that you made a mistake and that you feel guilty, but I wanna be here for you."
01:02:41.709,01:02:45.333,Okay. I get it. Thank you.
01:02:45.375,01:02:48.166,But I'm fine. I...
01:02:48.208,01:02:49.875,I don't need your help.
01:02:57.375,01:03:00.333,"Everybody needs help sometimes, Peter."
01:03:00.375,01:03:02.250,Even Spider-Man.
01:03:10.500,01:03:12.709,"MAN 3: Ninety X-ray, 98."
01:03:15.250,01:03:19.667,"WOMAN 1: Two-four King, respond to 10-31 at 642 Madison Ave."
01:03:19.709,01:03:24.750,"WOMAN 2: One-three Thomas, respond to 10-20 at 540 East 107."
01:03:24.792,01:03:28.667,Male complainant inside apartment 3B on first floor.
01:03:32.208,01:03:36.125,WOMAN 1: Three Henry 10-11 of a residence. 738...
01:04:35.875,01:04:37.750,CARRADINE: Don't hurt me.
01:04:37.792,01:04:40.458,PETER: What about my uncle?
01:04:40.500,01:04:41.583,Did you?
01:04:54.333,01:04:56.000,PETER: Where am I?
01:05:12.333,01:05:13.875,What is this?
01:05:16.291,01:05:17.750,I feel...
01:05:20.458,01:05:22.500,Wow.
01:05:22.542,01:05:24.667,This feels good.
01:05:33.375,01:05:35.709,Whoo!
01:05:36.667,01:05:37.959,Yeah!
01:05:44.709,01:05:46.417,Whoo!
01:05:54.709,01:05:56.125,This is something else.
01:05:58.458,01:05:59.792,What do you think?
01:05:59.834,01:06:02.083,I've never seen anything like it.
01:06:02.125,01:06:06.333,"I'm a physicist, not a biologist, but let me look at it in the morning. Run some tests."
01:06:06.375,01:06:07.375,Can we do that now?
01:06:12.959,01:06:14.500,It seems to like you.
01:06:17.792,01:06:20.542,-Don't let any of that get on you.
01:06:20.583,01:06:26.625,"It has the characteristics of a symbiote, which needs to bond to a host to survive."
01:06:26.667,01:06:33.959,"And sometimes these things in nature, when they bind, they can be hard to unbind."
01:06:34.000,01:06:38.041,"robbery in progress, First Eastern Bank at 202 Bismark."
01:06:38.083,01:06:42.333,Another sandstorm is reported in the vicinity.
01:06:42.375,01:06:43.458,Marko.
01:07:37.542,01:07:38.709,Whoa.
01:07:38.750,01:07:41.000,"Buddy, love the new outfit."
01:07:41.041,01:07:43.041,This is exactly what I need to scoop Parker.
01:07:43.083,01:07:44.625,Give some of that web action.
01:07:47.125,01:07:48.375,"See you, chump."
01:07:50.792,01:07:52.625,What the hell?
01:08:34.917,01:08:36.000,Flint Marko.
01:08:38.959,01:08:40.166,What do you want from me?
01:08:40.208,01:08:42.667,Remember Ben Parker?
01:08:42.709,01:08:45.208,The old man you shot down in cold blood?
01:08:47.083,01:08:48.959,"What does it matter to you, anyway?"
01:08:50.458,01:08:51.542,Everything!
01:09:29.792,01:09:31.709,"It's time to pay, Marko!"
01:10:24.875,01:10:25.875,Oh!
01:10:42.041,01:10:44.041,Good riddance.
01:11:05.000,01:11:07.875,-Rent.
01:11:07.917,01:11:10.959,"Listen, it's a free country."
01:11:11.000,01:11:13.041,-Leave me alone.
01:11:13.083,01:11:16.083,You'll get your rent when you fix this damn door!
01:11:27.208,01:11:29.625,That wasn't cool.
01:11:29.667,01:11:33.125,He is a good boy.
01:11:35.250,01:11:37.208,He must be in some kind of trouble.
01:12:25.291,01:12:31.500,"Flint Marko, the man who killed Uncle Ben, he was killed last night."
01:12:32.208,01:12:33.792,"Oh, my."
01:12:34.417,01:12:35.458,What happened?
01:12:36.166,01:12:37.542,Spider-Man killed him.
01:12:39.458,01:12:40.667,Spider-Man?
01:12:41.458,01:12:43.834,I don't understand.
01:12:43.875,01:12:46.417,Spider-Man doesn't kill people.
01:12:48.041,01:12:50.083,What happened?
01:12:52.709,01:12:54.333,"I, uh..."
01:12:55.208,01:12:56.500,He...
01:12:57.208,01:12:58.959,He was...
01:13:02.166,01:13:05.333,I thought that you'd feel...
01:13:08.375,01:13:11.166,"He deserved it, didn't he?"
01:13:11.208,01:13:16.166,I don't think it's for us to say whether a person deserves to live or die.
01:13:17.583,01:13:20.417,"But Aunt May, he killed Uncle Ben."
01:13:20.458,01:13:23.166,Uncle Ben meant the world to us.
01:13:23.208,01:13:29.417,But he wouldn't want us living one second with revenge in our hearts.
01:13:31.959,01:13:34.333,It's like a poison. It can...
01:13:35.166,01:13:37.250,It can take you over.
01:13:39.208,01:13:44.208,"Before you know it, turn us into something ugly."
01:14:45.917,01:14:47.166,Hello?
01:14:47.208,01:14:48.834,"Hey, Harry, it's M.J."
01:14:48.875,01:14:50.125,Hi.
01:14:50.166,01:14:51.583,I need some company.
01:14:51.625,01:14:54.291,Are you doing anything?
01:14:54.333,01:14:56.458,"Yeah, sure, come on over."
01:14:56.500,01:14:58.875,Okay. Are you sure it's okay?
01:14:58.917,01:15:01.750,"No, I'm not doing anything."
01:15:01.792,01:15:04.500,"-Okay, I'll see you soon."
01:15:04.542,01:15:06.750,Bye.
01:15:06.792,01:15:09.333,-Bernard.
01:15:09.375,01:15:11.834,We're having a guest.
01:15:11.875,01:15:14.041,-A guest?
01:15:14.083,01:15:16.250,A guest guest?
01:15:16.291,01:15:17.500,Will you just get some food?
01:15:17.542,01:15:19.417,"Right away, sir."
01:15:36.208,01:15:39.917,"Hey, Mr. Ditkovitch."
01:15:39.959,01:15:42.875,-An orange?
01:15:42.917,01:15:46.834,"Listen, I'm really sorry for what happened earlier."
01:15:46.875,01:15:50.166,I shouldn't have yelled about that door. It was nothing to be angry about.
01:15:50.208,01:15:52.500,It's no big deal.
01:15:52.542,01:15:56.667,"But if you feel that bad about it, you can buy me pizza sometime."
01:15:56.709,01:15:57.959,Today's good.
01:15:58.709,01:15:59.834,Okay.
01:15:59.875,01:16:01.375,Have problem with the phone?
01:16:01.417,01:16:02.959,"No, no. I was just..."
01:16:03.000,01:16:05.041,"Well, I was trying to figure out what to say."
01:16:05.083,01:16:12.834,"If it's a woman you're calling, then you say, You're a good woman."
01:16:15.250,01:16:17.500,Hmm?
01:16:17.542,01:16:19.500,"-URSULA: Hi, Pete."
01:16:19.542,01:16:21.125,He's calling a woman.
01:16:21.166,01:16:22.834,Are you calling Mary Jane?
01:16:22.875,01:16:26.875,This is none of your business. Go. Go. Call.
01:16:28.709,01:16:30.291,-You should call.
01:16:33.709,01:16:35.166,-Bye.
01:16:49.709,01:16:50.917,Hi.
01:16:54.166,01:16:56.500,-You hungry?
01:16:57.667,01:16:59.583,Come on.
01:17:03.375,01:17:05.583,-I hope you like peppers.
01:17:29.583,01:17:31.458,No. Please.
01:17:42.709,01:17:44.709,"Oh, the butter."
01:17:54.583,01:17:55.625,Beautiful.
01:18:01.125,01:18:02.709,Check this out.
01:18:05.625,01:18:07.375,MARY JANE: Oh!
01:18:10.041,01:18:13.917,"-Well, we can use that part."
01:18:13.959,01:18:16.208,You've been dreaming.
01:18:16.250,01:18:19.500,Nothing like a little self-deception to get you through the night.
01:18:19.542,01:18:22.542,-All right.
01:18:22.583,01:18:25.500,-Twelfth grade.
01:18:25.542,01:18:27.959,"So, do you want the part?"
01:18:28.000,01:18:29.333,I'd love to be in your play.
01:18:29.375,01:18:30.834,It's yours.
01:18:33.083,01:18:35.667,"You know, there's not even a scar."
01:18:37.875,01:18:39.583,Barely.
01:18:57.166,01:18:58.667,-Sorry.
01:18:58.709,01:19:00.208,I didn't mean to do that.
01:19:00.250,01:19:02.375,"No, it's okay."
01:19:04.208,01:19:05.208,Mary Jane.
01:19:06.792,01:19:09.375,Mary Jane!
01:19:09.417,01:19:12.542,"-Mary Jane, please."
01:19:12.583,01:19:13.875,Just...
01:19:25.875,01:19:29.458,OSBORN: You've taken your eye off the ball.
01:19:35.625,01:19:37.208,Harry.
01:19:50.208,01:19:51.458,What have you done?
01:19:53.959,01:19:55.208,Avenge me!
01:19:58.875,01:20:00.959,My father...
01:20:01.000,01:20:02.291,"He died, right?"
01:20:02.333,01:20:03.917,Yeah.
01:20:03.959,01:20:05.458,HARRY: Just wish I could remember more about him.
01:20:05.500,01:20:08.542,"PETER: Well, he loved you."
01:20:08.583,01:20:11.667,"HARRY: I swear on my father's grave, Spider-Man will pay."
01:20:12.583,01:20:14.333,OSBORN: Harry.
01:20:15.959,01:20:17.917,Remember me?
01:20:19.834,01:20:22.667,"Yes, Father. I remember."
01:20:22.709,01:20:26.375,I was right about her.
01:20:26.417,01:20:28.542,About everything.
01:20:29.917,01:20:33.875,You know what you must do.
01:20:33.917,01:20:36.458,Make him wish he were dead.
01:20:36.500,01:20:40.208,"First, we attack his heart."
01:20:50.583,01:20:52.750,"Hi, it's me."
01:20:53.875,01:20:56.667,"PETER: Hey, M.J. It's Peter."
01:20:56.709,01:20:58.583,Uh...
01:20:58.625,01:21:02.333,I wanna talk to you about last night.
01:21:02.375,01:21:04.542,I don't know what I was thinking.
01:21:04.583,01:21:08.417,I know you were just there to help and I...
01:21:09.542,01:21:12.375,I don't know. I wanna see you.
01:21:16.959,01:21:20.750,"If you want Peter to live, you're gonna do something for me."
01:21:25.000,01:21:26.792,-PETER: Yeah?
01:21:26.834,01:21:28.583,Come in.
01:21:37.291,01:21:39.166,"-Hi, Pete."
01:21:39.208,01:21:40.625,There's a phone call for you.
01:21:42.667,01:21:44.542,"It's Mary Jane, she called back!"
01:21:44.583,01:21:45.875,-Really?
01:21:48.291,01:21:50.667,I put the phone on top of the thing.
01:21:50.709,01:21:53.166,-Thanks. Okay.
01:21:55.625,01:21:57.542,-Hey.
01:21:57.583,01:22:00.333,"Oh, I'm so glad you called."
01:22:00.375,01:22:02.291,Can you meet me?
01:22:02.333,01:22:03.375,You bet.
01:22:03.417,01:22:05.875,-Now?
01:22:05.917,01:22:07.834,At the bridge in the park.
01:22:07.875,01:22:09.458,-On my way.
01:22:09.500,01:22:11.834,Okay. Hey. I love you.
01:22:31.792,01:22:33.792,You look beautiful.
01:22:35.083,01:22:36.709,Peonies.
01:22:39.125,01:22:42.792,-You okay?
01:22:42.834,01:22:44.834,"There's something I have to tell you, Pete."
01:22:45.417,01:22:46.792,Okay.
01:22:48.000,01:22:49.709,It's not working.
01:22:50.750,01:22:52.417,You and me.
01:22:53.542,01:22:55.291,What?
01:22:55.333,01:22:58.333,I don't wanna see you anymore.
01:22:58.375,01:22:59.834,What are you talking about?
01:22:59.875,01:23:01.166,I don't know.
01:23:04.917,01:23:06.709,I'm lonely.
01:23:07.917,01:23:09.500,You aren't there for me.
01:23:11.458,01:23:14.000,I can't do this.
01:23:14.041,01:23:15.041,It's over.
01:23:15.083,01:23:20.083,No. Please.
01:23:20.125,01:23:23.083,"I know I've been selfish, but I can do better."
01:23:23.125,01:23:24.583,It's not that simple.
01:23:24.625,01:23:26.959,We love each other.
01:23:27.000,01:23:28.917,We have problems.
01:23:27.000,01:23:31.542,When people have problems they work it out.
01:23:36.917,01:23:38.250,"Look, you see?"
01:23:38.291,01:23:39.291,Oh!
01:23:40.166,01:23:41.834,You know what this is?
01:23:43.333,01:23:44.417,You know what I want for us?
01:23:44.458,01:23:46.667,There's someone else.
01:23:46.709,01:23:49.542,I've fallen in love with someone else.
01:24:11.125,01:24:12.625,Bravo.
01:24:22.583,01:24:26.834,"She says that she's lonely, that I'm not there for her."
01:24:28.625,01:24:30.834,There's another guy.
01:24:33.792,01:24:35.583,"Well, how you holding up?"
01:24:36.417,01:24:38.000,Not good.
01:24:40.041,01:24:42.959,"Harry, I was gonna propose to her."
01:24:43.709,01:24:45.125,Really?
01:24:47.542,01:24:51.583,"Well, she's been going through a tough time lately. Career."
01:24:51.625,01:24:54.667,"I mean, a singing waitress at a jazz club?"
01:24:54.709,01:24:57.709,It's not exactly what she had in mind for herself.
01:24:57.750,01:25:01.166,Singing waitress?
01:25:01.208,01:25:05.834,"Well, she was fired from the show."
01:25:05.875,01:25:07.208,She was fired?
01:25:08.667,01:25:13.125,She was fired and she told you? She didn't tell me?
01:25:15.750,01:25:18.125,"Well, that's why I asked you here, Pete."
01:25:19.542,01:25:21.417,I'm the other guy.
01:25:23.208,01:25:24.417,What?
01:25:25.500,01:25:28.458,"She came to me one afternoon, troubled."
01:25:28.500,01:25:32.041,She needed someone and I was there for her.
01:25:32.083,01:25:35.458,"I've always loved her, Pete. You know that."
01:25:35.500,01:25:38.291,It just started.
01:25:46.792,01:25:50.583,I don't believe this.
01:25:50.625,01:25:52.000,I'm really sorry.
01:25:54.500,01:25:56.458,I just thought you should know.
01:26:04.709,01:26:06.208,Can I warm you up?
01:26:06.250,01:26:07.250,"Yes, please."
01:26:09.709,01:26:10.959,How's the pie?
01:26:12.166,01:26:13.875,So good.
01:27:17.208,01:27:19.041,Would you like a drink?
01:27:21.917,01:27:24.625,I'm sorry.
01:27:24.667,01:27:27.166,"Bad for the public image, right, Mr. Key-to-the-City?"
01:27:27.208,01:27:28.458,What did you do to her?
01:27:30.792,01:27:34.250,I did what you failed to do.
01:27:34.291,01:27:36.542,"Mary Jane and I, we understand each other."
01:27:36.583,01:27:37.667,She doesn't know what you are.
01:27:37.709,01:27:41.834,"Peter, she knows me very well."
01:27:41.875,01:27:46.333,"And when she kissed me, it was just like she used to kiss me."
01:27:46.375,01:27:48.166,That taste...
01:27:49.875,01:27:51.083,Strawberries.
01:28:26.792,01:28:28.250,"How'd you like that, Spidey?"
01:28:31.875,01:28:32.875,That all you got?
01:28:40.542,01:28:42.208,"Stings, doesn't it?"
01:28:42.250,01:28:43.375,I protected you in high school.
01:28:43.417,01:28:45.750,-Now I'm gonna kick your little ass.
01:29:33.000,01:29:35.000,Gonna kill me like you killed my father?
01:29:35.041,01:29:38.000,I'm done trying to convince you.
01:29:38.041,01:29:41.667,You took him from me.
01:29:41.709,01:29:45.792,No. He despised you.
01:29:45.834,01:29:48.000,You were an embarrassment to him.
01:29:49.542,01:29:51.792,Oh.
01:29:51.834,01:29:55.750,Look at little Goblin Junior.
01:30:32.417,01:30:34.583,WOMAN: Spider-Man used to make me feel safe.
01:30:34.625,01:30:36.667,Now I'm afraid to walk home from work.
01:30:36.709,01:30:38.458,My son thought the world of this guy.
01:30:38.500,01:30:40.500,"I have a 9-year-old daughter, loves Spider-Man."
01:30:40.542,01:30:42.792,Who's she supposed to look up to now?
01:30:42.834,01:30:45.083,WOMAN: This is the guy they gave the key to the city to?
01:30:45.125,01:30:48.000,I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye.
01:30:50.041,01:30:52.000,MAN: Cheers to the new staff photographer.
01:30:52.041,01:30:53.458,I just got lucky.
01:30:53.500,01:30:55.542,This is so wonderful for you.
01:30:55.583,01:30:58.625,"Well, you might wanna tell J.J. to make a little more wall space."
01:31:04.208,01:31:07.834,"Wow, good morning."
01:31:07.875,01:31:10.208,What was it you said?
01:31:11.041,01:31:14.250,-There's your hero.
01:31:14.291,01:31:16.041,I never thought he'd really do that.
01:31:16.083,01:31:17.792,See? Right there.
01:31:17.834,01:31:20.834,You made a judgment call.
01:31:20.875,01:31:29.834,"It's funny you should say that, because I was looking through some old photos and it looks very, uh, similar."
01:31:29.875,01:31:32.583,"Okay. Well, I gotta get back to work."
01:31:33.959,01:31:35.166,"You're trash, Brock."
01:31:35.208,01:31:36.834,Excuse me?
01:31:36.875,01:31:38.000,Your picture's a fake.
01:31:41.000,01:31:44.208,"Oh, Parker, you are such a boy scout."
01:31:44.250,01:31:45.625,When are you gonna give a guy a break?
01:31:48.166,01:31:50.834,You want forgiveness?
01:31:50.875,01:31:53.208,-What's going on here?
01:31:57.417,01:32:01.375,"Yeah. No, we... We're just horsing around."
01:32:01.417,01:32:05.667,"Look, I'm begging you."
01:32:05.709,01:32:08.083,There's not a paper in town that will hire me.
01:32:08.125,01:32:11.125,You should've thought of that earlier.
01:32:11.166,01:32:13.458,"ROBBIE: What are you doing, Peter?"
01:32:13.500,01:32:17.667,Show this to your editor.
01:32:23.959,01:32:25.667,ROBBIE: It's a fake.
01:32:25.709,01:32:28.875,Empire State Photographic Department confirms it.
01:32:33.291,01:32:35.542,Pack your things.
01:32:35.583,01:32:39.333,-I was just trying...
01:32:39.375,01:32:41.542,ROBBIE: You know we're gonna have to print a retraction now.
01:32:41.583,01:32:43.542,I haven't printed a retraction in 20 years.
01:32:49.667,01:32:50.667,Hello.
01:32:50.709,01:32:52.709,Mr. Parker. Dr. Connors here.
01:32:52.750,01:32:56.166,"Oh, Dr. Connors. How are you?"
01:32:57.375,01:33:00.875,"Quite a specimen you left me, Parker."
01:33:00.917,01:33:05.250,Its chemistry is not unlike the chondritic meteorites of the '70s.
01:33:05.291,01:33:06.750,Thanks.
01:33:06.792,01:33:09.208,-Mmm. That's good.
01:33:11.375,01:33:13.166,-Parker?
01:33:15.041,01:33:18.542,It amplifies characteristics of its host.
01:33:18.583,01:33:21.250,"-Hey, give me another cookie."
01:33:23.375,01:33:25.375,This could be dangerous.
01:33:25.417,01:33:29.000,"Peter, you didn't keep any, did you?"
01:33:29.041,01:33:30.333,You got any with nuts?
01:33:30.375,01:33:32.750,I have some nuts.
01:33:32.792,01:33:34.667,-Go make me some.
01:33:34.709,01:33:37.166,"No, no, no. Of course not."
01:33:51.709,01:33:53.792,Those shots are so good.
01:33:53.834,01:33:56.959,I'd love to shoot you sometime.
01:33:57.000,01:34:00.417,Peter Parker. Peter...
01:34:00.458,01:34:04.917,"Parker! Miss Brant, that's not the position I hired you for."
01:34:04.959,01:34:06.375,Black-suit Spider-Man.
01:34:07.792,01:34:10.291,"Peter, these are incredible."
01:34:10.333,01:34:13.166,"-We gotta have these, Jonah."
01:34:15.166,01:34:19.667,"If you want the shots, I'll take the staff job, double the money."
01:35:44.750,01:35:46.250,Penny.
01:35:52.375,01:35:54.875,You are really gonna dig this joint.
01:35:56.333,01:35:58.333,Do you think I'm...
01:35:58.375,01:36:00.250,"Too fancy, or too..."
01:36:00.291,01:36:03.709,Are you kidding me?
01:36:03.750,01:36:04.792,GWEN: Thank you.
01:36:05.917,01:36:07.709,PETER: Love that little giggle.
01:36:10.875,01:36:13.125,"Hey, keep it open there, pops."
01:36:16.208,01:36:19.667,"Oh, this is so cool."
01:36:19.709,01:36:22.375,I have never been to a jazz club before.
01:36:25.375,01:36:28.625,"Oh, I hope we can get a table."
01:36:33.417,01:36:35.375,Find us some shade.
01:36:36.875,01:36:39.458,"Thanks, hot legs."
01:36:39.500,01:36:41.417,"Right this way, sir."
01:36:49.375,01:36:51.458,"Oh, why, thank you."
01:36:56.625,01:36:59.750,-I am so loving this.
01:37:06.250,01:37:09.750,-Isn't that your old girlfriend?
01:37:09.792,01:37:11.542,Do you wanna go someplace else?
01:37:11.583,01:37:14.000,"Oh, no, no."
01:37:14.041,01:37:16.667,"-Mary Jane, show us what you got."
01:37:22.834,01:37:25.208,-I'll be right back.
01:37:35.000,01:37:36.333,MARY JANE: Peter?
01:37:39.208,01:37:40.208,This is for you.
01:37:46.834,01:37:48.083,Double-time!
01:37:53.709,01:37:55.834,Thanks.
01:38:22.083,01:38:23.041,Now dig on this.
01:38:25.333,01:38:26.500,WOMAN: That is hot!
01:38:31.875,01:38:33.959,CROWD: Ooh.
01:39:07.375,01:39:09.208,That was all for her?
01:39:17.709,01:39:18.875,I'm so sorry.
01:39:31.917,01:39:34.125,"-You all right, Mary Jane?"
01:39:34.625,01:39:35.959,Okay.
01:39:38.917,01:39:39.917,Hey.
01:39:42.667,01:39:43.875,What's wrong with you?
01:39:45.083,01:39:46.083,You.
01:39:47.083,01:39:48.291,"Can I help you, sir?"
01:39:48.917,01:39:50.375,No.
01:39:50.417,01:39:52.583,"Is everything okay here, Paul?"
01:39:52.625,01:39:55.166,"Yeah, is everything okay here, Paul?"
01:39:55.208,01:39:57.542,-Take him out of here.
01:39:57.583,01:39:59.333,Take your hand off of me.
01:39:59.375,01:40:00.458,BOUNCER: Now.
01:40:00.500,01:40:02.000,-Okay.
01:40:02.041,01:40:03.125,Get off!
01:40:04.166,01:40:05.542,"MAN: Hey, man, take it easy."
01:40:06.542,01:40:07.834,"Peter, stop it!"
01:40:19.709,01:40:21.041,Who are you?
01:40:23.709,01:40:25.125,I don't know.
01:41:57.875,01:41:59.917,"BROCK: It's Brock, sir."
01:41:59.959,01:42:02.417,"Edward Brock, Jr."
01:42:04.041,01:42:18.917,"I come before you today, humbled and humiliated, to ask you for one thing."
01:42:24.667,01:42:26.333,I want you to kill Peter Parker.
01:43:17.333,01:43:18.458,Parker.
01:45:02.417,01:45:04.250,"-Hi, Peter."
01:45:05.875,01:45:07.458,Hmm.
01:45:07.500,01:45:10.792,You don't seem to have changed the room around very much.
01:45:12.041,01:45:16.250,"Of course, there's not much you could do, is there?"
01:45:22.709,01:45:30.792,"When we spoke on the phone, I sensed that something was bothering you, so I thought I'd just come by."
01:45:33.875,01:45:36.792,How's Mary Jane?
01:45:36.834,01:45:38.417,I don't know.
01:45:40.875,01:45:43.500,I never heard from you.
01:45:43.542,01:45:45.375,Did you ever propose?
01:45:50.041,01:45:56.125,You said a husband's gotta put a wife before himself.
01:46:01.375,01:46:03.333,I'm not ready.
01:46:05.750,01:46:08.667,But what happened?
01:46:08.709,01:46:11.125,You seemed so sure.
01:46:12.333,01:46:14.000,Yeah.
01:46:15.250,01:46:17.000,"I, uh..."
01:46:27.333,01:46:29.542,"I hurt her, Aunt May."
01:46:31.041,01:46:33.041,I don't know what to do.
01:46:34.959,01:46:39.333,"Well, you start by doing the hardest thing."
01:46:39.375,01:46:41.542,You forgive yourself.
01:46:45.500,01:46:48.166,"I believe in you, Peter."
01:46:48.208,01:46:50.041,You're a good person.
01:46:52.208,01:46:56.333,And I know you will find a way to put it right.
01:47:04.875,01:47:06.041,In time.
01:47:24.834,01:47:26.542,"MARKO: End of the line, Spider-Man."
01:47:31.166,01:47:33.041,"I want him dead too, Flint."
01:47:34.041,01:47:36.542,That's why I've been looking for you.
01:47:36.583,01:47:39.917,"Oh, yeah."
01:47:39.959,01:47:44.250,Like the fact that Spider-Man won't let you help your poor daughter.
01:47:44.291,01:47:47.834,It's just... That doesn't seem right to me.
01:47:47.875,01:47:52.875,"Look, I wanna kill the spider, you wanna kill the spider."
01:47:52.917,01:47:56.166,"Together, he doesn't stand a chance."
01:47:57.166,01:47:59.208,Interested?
01:48:00.542,01:48:02.041,Yeah.
01:49:04.041,01:49:05.083,DRIVER: So...
01:49:06.542,01:49:09.000,Where to?
01:49:09.041,01:49:13.542,All New York is holding its breath as the hostage crisis continues to unfold.
01:49:15.291,01:49:19.000,"REPORTER: Just 30 minutes ago, police came across a startling sight."
01:49:19.041,01:49:26.667,"A young woman, held hostage in a taxi suspended 80 stories above the ground in what appears to be a giant web."
01:49:26.709,01:49:31.625,ANCHORMAN: Every attempt by the police to rescue the hostage has been thwarted by the Sandman.
01:49:34.917,01:49:39.291,Compounding the danger is the appearance of a strange black-suited figure.
01:49:39.333,01:49:46.667,"Early reports had believed him to be the black-suited Spider-Man, but he has now been identified as something entirely different."
01:49:48.375,01:49:56.208,"The hostage has been identified as Mary Jane Watson, an actress recently seen in a brief stint on Broadway."
01:50:21.875,01:50:26.291,"We're now going to take you live to the scene, with Jennifer Dugan."
01:50:26.333,01:50:29.041,"We're only about 100 feet away now, Hal, and..."
01:50:29.083,01:50:33.000,Wait. There seems to be some kind of activity in the web.
01:50:33.041,01:50:36.542,It seems to be creating some kind of gigantic lettering.
01:50:39.542,01:50:42.458,"Apparently, Spider-Man's being challenged to some sort of confrontation."
01:50:42.500,01:50:46.875,And that raises serious questions about what kind of chance he'd stand against such overwhelming...
01:50:58.166,01:50:59.458,PETER: Harry?
01:51:03.333,01:51:05.375,I need your help.
01:51:05.417,01:51:08.709,"I can't take them both, not by myself."
01:51:15.333,01:51:18.041,You don't deserve my help.
01:51:21.041,01:51:25.208,"Harry, she needs us."
01:51:29.709,01:51:31.375,Get out.
01:51:48.041,01:51:51.041,"BERNARD: If I may, sir..."
01:51:51.083,01:51:56.792,I've seen things in this house I've never spoken of.
01:51:56.834,01:51:58.542,What are you trying to tell me?
01:51:59.458,01:52:04.750,The night your father died I cleaned his wound.
01:52:06.375,01:52:13.583,The blade that pierced his body came from his glider.
01:52:13.625,01:52:23.792,"I know you're trying to defend your father's honor, but there's no question that he died by his own hand."
01:52:27.208,01:52:34.417,"I loved your father, as I have loved you, Harry."
01:52:34.458,01:52:37.333,As your friends love you.
01:53:24.375,01:53:25.542,-Look.
01:53:46.500,01:53:49.875,Spider-Man!
01:53:55.542,01:54:01.834,"He seems to have come out of nowhere to answer the prayers of the city, just when all hope seemed to be lost."
01:54:07.709,01:54:11.041,Peter.
01:54:11.083,01:54:13.333,-I'm gonna get you out of this.
01:54:23.750,01:54:25.375,"Hey, Parker."
01:54:25.417,01:54:26.792,My God. Eddie.
01:54:26.834,01:54:33.208,"Ooh, my spider-sense is tingling, if you know what I'm talking about."
01:54:52.542,01:54:54.375,We can find a way to settle this.
01:54:54.417,01:54:56.250,You're so right.
01:54:56.291,01:55:00.417,I'm thinking humiliation.
01:55:00.458,01:55:02.709,Kind of like how you humiliated me.
01:55:03.583,01:55:05.375,Do you remember?
01:55:07.250,01:55:09.875,Do you remember what you did to me?
01:55:25.625,01:55:29.041,You made me lose my girl.
01:55:30.875,01:55:32.875,"How's that sound, Tiger?"
01:56:32.750,01:56:34.542,"Hold on, Mary Jane!"
01:57:04.667,01:57:06.917,Mary Jane!
01:58:07.375,01:58:11.417,It's hard to believe what's happening.
01:58:11.458,01:58:14.500,The brutality of it.
01:58:14.542,01:58:16.458,I don't know how he can take any more.
01:58:16.500,01:58:20.000,This could be a tragic day for the people of New York.
01:58:20.041,01:58:22.041,It could be the end of Spider-Man.
01:58:37.709,01:58:39.667,Hmm?
01:58:48.583,01:58:50.792,-Awesome!
01:59:15.834,01:59:17.208,You came.
01:59:25.125,01:59:27.500,Looks like just in the nick of time.
01:59:27.542,01:59:30.250,A couple minutes ago wouldn't have been so bad either.
01:59:30.291,01:59:31.583,What are you gonna do?
01:59:35.166,01:59:37.125,I may need some help over here.
01:59:37.166,01:59:39.709,I'm a little busy right now.
01:59:40.875,01:59:42.667,Give me your hand!
01:59:57.041,02:00:00.000,"Parker! Parker, where..."
02:00:00.041,02:00:01.834,I need a photographer.
02:00:01.875,02:00:03.542,"Hey, kid, you want a job?"
02:00:03.583,02:00:06.792,Why would I want a job?
02:00:06.834,02:00:09.667,"-All right, how much for the camera?"
02:00:09.709,02:00:11.000,100 bucks?
02:00:13.166,02:00:16.959,"All right, you little crook. Here."
02:00:18.792,02:00:20.083,What the...
02:00:22.208,02:00:23.583,Film's extra.
02:00:29.583,02:00:30.750,Gotcha.
02:00:39.208,02:00:40.583,"Pete, up top!"
02:01:00.375,02:01:02.375,SPIDER-MAN: Mary Jane!
02:01:04.542,02:01:06.667,-This thing got any more?
02:01:06.709,02:01:07.834,To what?
02:01:12.125,02:01:14.000,"-Go, buddy!"
02:01:25.291,02:01:26.333,You okay?
02:01:28.417,02:01:30.041,Yeah.
02:01:32.875,02:01:34.208,Good.
02:01:34.250,02:01:35.333,"HARRY: Hey, Pete."
02:01:37.375,02:01:39.250,Am I interrupting?
02:02:55.458,02:03:00.208,Never wound what you can't kill.
02:03:04.041,02:03:07.792,"Eddie, the suit, you gotta take it off."
02:03:07.834,02:03:09.375,"Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?"
02:03:12.333,02:03:14.125,I know what it feels like.
02:03:14.834,02:03:16.417,It feels good.
02:03:16.458,02:03:19.417,The power. Everything.
02:03:19.458,02:03:21.208,But you'll lose yourself.
02:03:22.250,02:03:24.500,Let it go.
02:03:24.542,02:03:26.542,I like being bad.
02:03:27.458,02:03:29.250,It makes me happy.
02:04:18.875,02:04:19.959,Harry!
02:05:33.000,02:05:34.709,Peter. What are you doing?
02:05:36.208,02:05:38.083,No!
02:05:39.875,02:05:40.917,Eddie!
02:06:00.333,02:06:02.291,-Harry.
02:06:02.333,02:06:03.875,-I'm gonna get help.
02:06:05.166,02:06:06.500,Stay.
02:06:15.250,02:06:17.500,MARKO: I didn't want this.
02:06:22.041,02:06:23.375,But I had no choice.
02:06:27.709,02:06:30.083,We always have a choice.
02:06:30.125,02:06:32.291,You had a choice when you killed my uncle.
02:06:34.709,02:06:36.375,My daughter was dying.
02:06:39.041,02:06:40.709,I needed money.
02:06:45.542,02:06:47.542,I was scared.
02:06:55.125,02:06:58.333,I told your uncle all I wanted was the car.
02:06:58.375,02:07:00.667,-What is it?
02:07:00.709,02:07:06.250,"He said to me, Why don't you just put down the gun and go home?"
02:07:10.333,02:07:13.333,I realize now he was just trying to help me.
02:07:19.834,02:07:23.166,Then I saw my partner running over with the cash.
02:07:23.208,02:07:24.333,And the gun was in my hand.
02:07:36.083,02:07:37.417,Get in!
02:07:39.375,02:07:46.458,"MARKO: I did a terrible thing to you, and I spent a lot of nights wishing I could take it back."
02:07:51.667,02:07:54.333,I'm not asking you to forgive me.
02:07:55.250,02:07:57.542,I just want you to understand.
02:08:07.375,02:08:10.083,I've done terrible things too.
02:08:26.291,02:08:29.000,MARKO: I didn't choose to be this.
02:08:37.709,02:08:44.375,The only thing left of me now is my daughter.
02:08:56.542,02:08:58.542,I forgive you.
02:09:41.834,02:09:45.041,"Hey, pal. How you doing?"
02:09:45.083,02:09:46.166,Been better.
02:09:48.250,02:09:50.041,We'll get you through this.
02:09:53.792,02:09:55.375,No.
02:10:02.917,02:10:05.250,I should never have hurt you...
02:10:07.166,02:10:09.375,Said those things.
02:10:10.917,02:10:13.542,"HARRY: None of that matters, Peter."
02:10:15.625,02:10:17.417,You're my friend.
02:10:22.250,02:10:23.875,Best friend.
02:10:42.792,02:10:44.542,Harry.
02:11:30.542,02:11:37.875,"PETER: Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside us, we always have a choice."
02:11:40.000,02:11:42.333,"My friend, Harry, taught me that."
02:11:42.375,02:11:46.417,He chose to be the best of himself.
02:11:46.458,02:11:52.709,"It's the choices that make us who we are, and we can always choose to do what's right."
