00:05:55.022,00:05:57.440,"YOU KNOW THE CHIEF'S GONNA KILL US, RIGHT?"
00:05:58.817,00:06:02.279,"LET ME, UH, GIVE YOU GUYS A LITTLE TIP."
00:06:02.279,00:06:13.581,"IF YOU'RE GOING TO OPERATE OUTSIDE THE CHANNELS, YOU KNOW, DO THE WHOLE RENEGADE COP THING, YOU MIGHT WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET THE RIGHT GUY."
00:06:13.581,00:06:18.170,"WELL, UH, CHIEF, WE-- WE ALMOST HAD THE GUY."
00:06:18.170,00:06:20.547,"UH, UH, OUR INTELLIGENCE WAS JUST A LITTLE OFF."
00:06:20.547,00:06:23.050,WAIT A MINUTE.
00:06:23.050,00:06:24.634,"LOOK AROUND YOU, COPELAND."
00:06:24.634,00:06:26.594,THERE'S NOTHING INTELLIGENT ABOUT THIS.
00:06:26.594,00:06:29.097,"NOW, I'M TIRED OF YOUR ESCAPADES."
00:06:29.097,00:06:32.017,THE LAST THING I NEED IS TO BE THE LAUGHINGSTOCK OF THE BUREAU.
00:06:32.017,00:06:35.812,"AND FURTHERMORE, THE-- HOLD ON."
00:06:35.812,00:06:37.939,"HELLO? UH, BABY, I CAN'T TALK."
00:06:37.939,00:06:39.358,THE CHIEF IS CHEWING MY ASS RIGHT NOW.
00:06:39.358,00:06:40.775,"I GOT TO CALL YOU BACK, OK? BYE."
00:06:40.775,00:06:42.027,"SORRY, CHIEF."
00:06:42.027,00:06:50.493,AS I WAS SAYING-- GORDON HERE.
00:06:52.871,00:06:54.331,"YES, HE IS."
00:06:58.501,00:07:00.254,IT'S FOR YOU.
00:07:00.254,00:07:03.673,"UH, BABY, I'M STILL WITH THE CHIEF."
00:07:03.673,00:07:05.633,"NO, HE'S REALLY NOT HAPPY NOW."
00:07:05.633,00:07:08.469,"OK, I GOT TO GO. BYE."
00:07:08.469,00:07:10.180,"THANKS, CHIEF."
00:07:12.182,00:07:16.270,YOU--YOU GUYS ARE...
00:07:16.270,00:07:19.273,I EXPECT TO HAVE A FULL REPORT ON MY DESK TOMORROW.
00:07:19.273,00:07:21.066,YES.
00:07:21.066,00:07:26.947,"AND IN THE MEANTIME, I'M CHECKING WITH THE BUREAU TO SEE IF THEY GOT ANY OPENINGS IN IRAQ."
00:07:31.159,00:07:33.203,THE DYNAMIC DUO STRIKES AGAIN.
00:07:33.203,00:07:35.289,"WAY TO GO, BASKIN AND ROBBIN."
00:07:37.249,00:07:40.710,OR--OR IS IT HAAG AND DAZS?
00:07:42.212,00:07:45.299,HAAG AND DAZS.
00:07:45.299,00:07:47.301,THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
00:07:47.301,00:07:48.302,"LATER, HAAG."
00:07:48.302,00:07:50.387,"ADIOS, DAZS."
00:07:52.139,00:07:53.432,"I HATE THOSE GUYS, DUDE."
00:07:53.432,00:07:55.350,"OH, GOD."
00:07:55.350,00:07:58.270,"ALL RIGHT. WELL, LET'S GET THIS PLACE CLEANED UP."
00:07:58.270,00:07:59.520,ALL RIGHT.
00:07:58.270,00:08:01.315,"OK, SO, UH, YOU DO THE FLOOR."
00:08:01.315,00:08:03.442,CLEAN ALL THE ICE CREAM UP AND I'LL GO WARM THE CAR UP.
00:08:03.442,00:08:04.859,OK.
00:08:15.120,00:08:17.705,OK. SO MUCH FOR A HOT MEAL.
00:08:22.919,00:08:25.172,"HEY, BABY."
00:08:25.172,00:08:28.383,I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE ME SITTING HERE ALL NIGHT WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
00:08:28.383,00:08:33.305,"ALL NIGHT? BABY, IT'S ONLY 8:00!"
00:08:33.305,00:08:35.640,"LOOK, AFTER WORK, ME AND KEVIN WENT DOWN TO THE BAR."
00:08:35.640,00:08:37.309,WE JUST HAD A COUPLE OF DRINKS.
00:08:37.309,00:08:39.060,I KNOW.
00:08:39.060,00:08:40.812,THEY SAID YOU LEFT AT 7:45.
00:08:40.812,00:08:42.314,"I CHECKED MAPQUEST, MARCUS."
00:08:42.314,00:08:44.232,IT ONLY TAKES 6 MINUTES TO GET THERE FROM HERE.
00:08:44.232,00:08:47.277,"SO, IF YOU GOT SOMEBODY ON THE SIDE, MARCUS, YOU NEED TO TELL ME."
00:08:47.277,00:08:49.779,"BABY, LISTEN TO WHAT YOU JUST SAY."
00:08:49.779,00:08:53.783,MAPQUEST SAID IT TAKES 6 MINUTES TO GET HERE.
00:08:53.783,00:08:56.328,WHICH MEANS THERE'S 2 MINUTES UNACCOUNTED FOR.
00:08:56.328,00:09:00.581,"IF I WAS CHEATING ON YOU, DON'T YOU THINK I'D NEED MORE THAN 2 MINUTES?"
00:09:01.500,00:09:03.293,YOU KNOW WHAT?
00:09:03.293,00:09:05.337,"I AIN'T GOING TO DEAL WITH THIS. I'M TIRED, OK?"
00:09:05.337,00:09:07.714,I HAD A LONG DAY AT WORK.
00:09:07.714,00:09:10.675,"SEE, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT."
00:09:10.675,00:09:12.386,WE DON'T COMMUNICATE.
00:09:12.386,00:09:13.803,"OK, FINE."
00:09:13.803,00:09:15.389,YOU WANT TO COMMUNICATE?
00:09:15.389,00:09:17.224,YES.
00:09:17.224,00:09:20.643,COME ON.
00:09:20.643,00:09:23.397,OK. LET'S START WITH LAST WEEK.
00:09:23.397,00:09:24.939,LAST WEEK.
00:09:24.939,00:09:26.566,YOU AND I WERE SUPPOSED TO GO SHOPPING TOGETHER.
00:09:26.566,00:09:31.821,"WE GET TO THE MALL, I BUY THIS BEAUTIFUL DRESS, I GET MY HAIR DONE."
00:09:31.821,00:09:33.365,YOU DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
00:09:33.365,00:09:35.825,"I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO..."
00:09:37.118,00:09:38.412,MARCUS!
00:09:38.412,00:09:39.538,MMM?
00:09:39.538,00:09:41.122,DID YOU HEAR ME JUST NOW?
00:09:41.122,00:09:42.999,MMM-HMM.
00:09:42.999,00:09:44.918,I HEARD EVERYTHING.
00:09:44.918,00:09:46.336,"MARCUS, DON'T PLAY WITH ME RIGHT NOW."
00:09:46.336,00:09:48.004,I AM NOT IN THE MOOD.
00:09:48.004,00:09:52.175,I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU CAME HOME LATE AND THEN YOU START-- MARCUS!
00:09:52.175,00:09:54.844,YOU ARE FALLING ASLEEP AGAIN.
00:09:54.844,00:09:58.390,"I WASN'T ASLEEP, BABY."
00:09:58.390,00:10:00.267,"OH, REALLY?"
00:10:00.267,00:10:03.228,WHY DON'T YOU PAINT ME A PICTURE OF WHAT I JUST SAID?
00:10:03.228,00:10:04.479,HOLD ON.
00:10:04.479,00:10:05.939,YOU KNOW WHY?
00:10:05.939,00:10:09.067,BECAUSE YOU ARE FALLING ASLEEP AGAIN. MARCUS!
00:10:09.067,00:10:10.444,MARCUS!
00:10:12.237,00:10:18.243,"NOW, WE RECEIVED THIS FROM MR. ANDREW WILSON, C.E.O. OF WILSON CRUISE LINES."
00:10:18.243,00:10:19.953,IT WAS DELIVERED TO HIS HOME.
00:10:19.953,00:10:26.126,THE GIRLS IN THE PHOTO ARE HIS DAUGHTERS AND HEIRESSES TO THE WILSON FORTUNE.
00:10:26.126,00:10:30.338,WE BELIEVE THEY ARE THE KIDNAPPER'S NEXT VICTIMS.
00:10:30.338,00:10:33.633,MR. WILSON HAS GIVEN US PERMISSION TO SHADOW HIS DAUGHTERS.
00:10:33.633,00:10:41.349,"WE'RE GOING TO SET UP SURVEILLANCE, AND IF THE KIDNAPPER STRIKES, THIS TIME WE WILL BE READY."
00:10:41.349,00:10:46.687,"NOW, THE WILSON SISTERS WILL BE FLYING INTO J.F.K."
00:10:46.687,00:10:49.149,SO WHO'S GOING TO PICK 'EM UP?
00:10:50.066,00:10:51.359,OK.
00:10:51.359,00:10:55.655,"OBVIOUSLY, EVERYONE HAS READ THE PROFILE ON THE GIRLS."
00:10:55.655,00:10:58.492,"STILL, SOMEBODY'S GOT TO DO IT."
00:10:58.492,00:11:00.410,I DON'T THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.
00:11:00.410,00:11:02.329,KEVIN.
00:11:02.329,00:11:04.623,WE DESERVE TO BE ON THIS CASE JUST AS MUCH AS GOMEZ AND HARPER.
00:11:04.623,00:11:07.792,"I KNOW, BUT WE DON'T WANT TO INTERRUPT THE MAN IN THE MIDDLE OF A BRIEFING."
00:11:07.792,00:11:09.503,"WELL, SOMEBODY GOT TO STAND UP TO HIM."
00:11:09.503,00:11:11.338,KEVIN. KEVIN!
00:11:11.338,00:11:12.839,CHIEF.
00:11:12.839,00:11:15.467,MARCUS HAS SOMETHING HE WANT TO TELL YOU.
00:11:15.467,00:11:18.761,"UM, CHIEF, WE--WE JUST WANT TO KNOW IF WE COULD GET ON THE CASE."
00:11:18.761,00:11:20.221,YOU'RE ON.
00:11:21.722,00:11:26.478,THE BOYS OVER AT INTEL SEEM TO THINK THAT THE KIDNAPPER'S A GUY NAMED TED BURTON.
00:11:26.478,00:11:31.690,IT SAYS BURTON WAS A PARTNER OF WILSON'S AND SOME OTHER ASSOCIATES IN SOME BUSINESS VENTURE THAT FAILED.
00:11:31.690,00:11:35.445,SAYS HE SPENT TIME IN THE FEDERAL PEN AND LOST HIS FORTUNE.
00:11:35.445,00:11:37.447,GUY'S BEEN M.I.A.
00:11:35.445,00:11:39.991,"SINCE HIS RELEASE, AND THOSE DATES COINCIDE WITH THE FIRST KIDNAPPINGS."
00:11:39.991,00:11:41.326,WHAT DO YOU THINK?
00:11:41.326,00:11:42.785,I THINK THIS BABYSITTING GIG SUCKS.
00:11:42.785,00:11:45.121,"DUDE, RELAX. LOOK, MAN."
00:11:45.121,00:11:50.293,"ALL WE GOT TO DO IS PICK THESE CHICKS UP, DROP THEIR ASS OFF IN THE HAMPTONS, THEN WE BACK IN THE CHIEF'S GOOD GRACES."
00:11:50.293,00:11:52.462,I DIDN'T JOIN THE F.B.I. TO BECOME A NANNY.
00:11:52.462,00:11:54.506,I WANT TO BE OUT ON THE STREET WHERE THE ACTION IS.
00:11:54.506,00:11:56.466,"OK, BLACKIE CHAN, AND YOU'LL GET THERE."
00:11:56.466,00:11:58.176,"BUT CAN WE JUST DO THIS FIRST, PLEASE?"
00:11:58.176,00:11:59.469,ALL RIGHT.
00:11:59.469,00:12:01.304,"YOU DIDN'T PUT DAIRY IN THIS, DID YOU?"
00:12:01.304,00:12:03.014,NO.
00:12:03.014,00:12:04.807,"NOW, 'CAUSE YOU KNOW I'M LACTOSE INTOLERANT."
00:12:04.807,00:12:06.809,"LAST TIME, I BARELY MADE IT TO THE BATHROOM, MAN."
00:12:06.809,00:12:09.646,WHY WOULD I WANT TO DISTURB YOUR STOMACH?
00:12:11.565,00:12:13.567,THERE GOES YOUR GIRLS!
00:12:13.567,00:12:15.402,"COME ON, MAN. LET'S DO THIS."
00:12:22.867,00:12:24.536,"HI, I'M KEVIN COPELAND."
00:12:22.867,00:12:26.621,THIS IS-- WE ALREADY GAVE TO THE UNITED NEGRO FUND.
00:12:26.621,00:12:27.830,YEAH.
00:12:27.830,00:12:29.123,WHAT?
00:12:29.123,00:12:30.584,WAIT.
00:12:30.584,00:12:32.085,HOLD ON. HOLD ON. HOLD ON.
00:12:30.584,00:12:34.588,WE'RE ACTUALLY HERE TO ESCORT YOU LADIES TO THE HAMPTONS.
00:12:34.588,00:12:36.172,"OH, THE BAGS ARE ON THE PLANE."
00:12:36.172,00:12:38.299,TAKE BABY AND CLEAN OUT HIS BAG.
00:12:38.299,00:12:41.428,"OH, MY GOD, HE DIDN'T HAVE HIS COLONIC AND HE LIKE POOPED EVERYWHERE."
00:12:50.562,00:12:51.646,WHAT'S THIS?
00:12:51.646,00:12:53.856,BABY GOT TO RIDE IN THE CAR SEAT.
00:12:53.856,00:12:55.816,AND WHERE THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO SIT?
00:12:55.816,00:12:57.277,THIS AIN'T RIGHT.
00:13:09.914,00:13:13.668,"MAN, YOU GUYS SURE GOT A LOT OF BAGS FOR A WEEKEND."
00:13:14.961,00:13:18.381,"THIS ISN'T A WEEKEND, IT'S THE WEEKEND."

01:02:00.551,01:02:02.844,"JUST A LITTLE TURN, HUH?"
01:02:02.844,01:02:08.392,"THERE'S SO MANY KEYS INVOLVED, SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WHAT."
01:02:10.977,01:02:13.980,"HEY, HEY..."

01:02:23.823,01:02:25.992,THERE ARE LAWS AGAINST THIS KIND OF WORKMANSHIP.
01:02:25.992,01:02:28.537,THEY'RE GONNA THINK I'M RUNNING SOME KIND OF SWEATSHOP.
01:02:28.537,01:02:32.207,"THAT GIRL DOES NOT KNOW WHEN TO GO HOME, MAN."
01:02:32.207,01:02:36.670,"I'M TELLING YOU, SHE WILL STAY HERE AND JUST CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN FOREVER."
01:02:36.670,01:02:38.714,WHEW!

01:04:20.649,01:04:22.400,"OH, YOU HAVE A DOG."
01:04:22.400,01:04:24.736,"NO, I DON'T HAVE NO DAMN DOG."
01:04:26.446,01:04:29.991,"WELL, THEN WHOSE DOG IS THAT?"
01:04:33.161,01:04:34.788,"OH, SHIT."
01:04:37.541,01:04:40.836,THAT'S--THAT'S NOT NO DOG.
01:04:40.836,01:04:42.546,THAT'S FAMILY.
01:04:44.297,01:04:45.882,"HEY, COUSIN."

01:05:07.320,01:05:09.740,YOU WANT ME TO GO FOR HELP?
01:05:09.740,01:05:11.700,"NO, WE'RE JUST HAVING FUN."
01:05:11.700,01:05:13.827,OW! YOU SURE ARE PLAYFUL TODAY.
01:05:16.371,01:05:18.832,"YOU WANT TO GO FOR A WALK, BOY?"
01:05:20.041,01:05:22.544,I'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
01:05:22.544,01:05:25.422,YOU KNOW WHAT?
01:05:25.422,01:05:29.760,I DON'T WANT TO GO ON A DATE WITH A GUY AND HIS DOG IS BITING HIM AND...

01:05:36.683,01:05:39.770,"OK, WHAT'S HE DOING NOW?"
01:05:39.770,01:05:41.688,DON'T PAY HIM NO MIND.
01:05:41.688,01:05:44.858,HE'S JUST GOING TO DO THAT UNTIL HE FALLS ASLEEP.
01:05:47.277,01:05:49.987,"NOW, WHERE WERE WE?"
01:05:51.656,01:05:53.450,"OH, GOD!"
01:06:01.165,01:06:05.587,"YOU KNOW, I, UH, LIKE A WOMAN WITH A LITTLE EXTRA SOMETHING."
01:06:07.088,01:06:11.384,A LITTLE CUSHION FOR THE PUSHIN'.
01:06:11.384,01:06:14.137,I'D REALLY LOVE FOR YOU TO COME TO ONE OF MY GAMES.
01:06:14.137,01:06:16.807,"NO, THANK YOU."
01:06:16.807,01:06:18.975,NOT IMPRESSED.
01:06:18.975,01:06:21.812,I'M THE HIGHEST SCORIN' FORWARD IN THE LEAGUE!
01:06:21.812,01:06:24.397,YEAH.
01:06:24.397,01:06:27.317,TOTALLY OVERSHADOWED BY NOTHIN' BUT SCANDALS AND PURE LAZINESS.
01:06:27.317,01:06:31.488,"I MEAN, COME ON! YOU'RE SHOOTIN' UNDER 50 PERCENT FROM THE FREE THROW LINE, OK?"
01:06:31.488,01:06:33.156,"YOUR TURNOVER RATIO, ABYSMAL."
01:06:33.156,01:06:38.954,"AND ON TOP OF THAT, YOU CAN'T SHOOT 3-POINTERS TO SAVE YOUR LIFE. SO, UH, SQUEEZE ME."
01:06:47.838,01:06:50.757,NO ONE'S EVER CARED LIKE THAT BEFORE.
01:06:52.509,01:06:54.010,"COME HERE, BABY!"
01:06:58.139,01:06:59.599,"OH, OH!"

01:07:11.402,01:07:12.737,OH!
01:07:12.737,01:07:14.155,BASK IN THE AMBIENCE!
01:07:14.155,01:07:16.741,I'M GOING TO BE SICK.
01:07:16.741,01:07:19.703,"SO, NO. I JUMP OVER THE FENCE, FALL."
01:07:19.703,01:07:23.498,I SCRAPE MY KNEE-- GET OUT OF HERE.
01:07:23.498,01:07:28.127,"I SCRAPE MY KNEE, I GET CHASED BY THE COPS, AND I SPEND THE NIGHT IN JAIL."
01:07:28.127,01:07:29.796,THAT'S INSANE.
01:07:28.127,01:07:31.673,YOU DID ALL THAT JUST TO FIND J-LO AND BEN'S HIDEAWAY?
01:07:31.673,01:07:32.924,I CAN'T HELP IT.
01:07:31.673,01:07:35.635,"YOU KNOW, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM IS MY PASSION."
01:07:35.635,01:07:39.347,SO HOW'D YOU END UP WRITING PUFF PIECES FOR THE LOCAL NEWS?
01:07:40.765,01:07:46.062,"UNFORTUNATELY, I--I MADE SOME ENEMIES, AND ENDED UP GETTING FIRED FROM MY LAST JOB."
01:07:46.062,01:07:47.814,WHAT HAPPENED?
01:07:46.062,01:07:49.983,"OH, BELIEVE ME, YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THAT."
01:07:49.983,01:07:52.903,"LOOK, I SPENT ALL NIGHT TALKIN' ABOUT MYSELF."
01:07:52.903,01:07:56.823,SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD FOR A MAN TO JUST SIT BACK AND LISTEN.
01:07:57.866,01:07:59.325,"WELL, SINCE YOU PUT IT THAT WAY."
01:07:59.325,01:08:00.827,MMM-HMM?
01:08:03.413,01:08:06.499,I DID THIS PIECE ON WARREN VANDERGELD.
01:08:06.499,01:08:09.544,HIM AND HIS PARTNERS TRIED TO SWINDLE A GUY.
01:08:09.544,01:08:12.171,YOU TALKIN' ABOUT TED BURTON?
01:08:12.171,01:08:13.965,"YEAH, HOW--HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?"
01:08:13.965,01:08:16.843,I-IT WAS IN THE PAPER.
01:08:16.843,01:08:22.807,"WELL, BUT WHAT THEY DIDN'T REPORT IN THE PAPER WAS THAT BURTON WAS 10 TIMES SMARTER THAN ALL OF THEM."
01:08:22.807,01:08:26.895,HE EMBEZZLED MILLIONS AND STASHED IT IN AN OFFSHORE ACCOUNT.
01:08:28.980,01:08:33.985,"WHEN VANDERGELD HEARD THE STORY WAS GOING TO BREAK, HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE EMBARRASSED."
01:08:33.985,01:08:35.946,"WELL, THERE GOES MY JOB."
01:08:37.906,01:08:39.908,"YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A GOOD LISTENER."
01:08:39.908,01:08:43.119,IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE THE WHOLE PACKAGE.
01:09:00.344,01:09:01.972,"OH, MAN!"
01:09:04.975,01:09:06.017,HELLO?
01:09:06.017,01:09:07.769,"YO, KEV, YOU GOT TO GO."
01:09:07.769,01:09:09.062,WHAT? NOW?
01:09:09.062,01:09:11.439,"YEAH, NOW. WE'RE ON OUR WAY."
01:09:11.439,01:09:13.775,"COME ON, MAN, CAN'T YOU STALL HIM FOR A LITTLE WHILE?"
01:09:13.775,01:09:19.238,"LOOK, THIS MAN SANG TO ME, HE TRIED TO KISS ME AND, ON TOP OF THAT, HE BEEN FARTING FOR THE LAST 20 MINUTES."
01:09:19.238,01:09:23.076,ALL RIGHT.
01:09:23.076,01:09:25.078,"OH, COTTONTAIL!"
01:09:25.078,01:09:26.788,"I'M COMIN', NIGGA!"
01:09:29.874,01:09:31.918,"GOMEZ, WHAT THE HELL ARE WE LOOKING FOR?"
01:09:31.918,01:09:33.377,I DON'T KNOW.
01:09:33.377,01:09:35.672,SOMETHING JUST AIN'T RIGHT ABOUT THESE GIRLS.
01:09:35.672,01:09:38.049,I'M GONNA CHECK THE BATHROOM.
01:09:48.768,01:09:51.021,FIND ANYTHING?
01:09:51.021,01:09:53.898,"UH, NO. NOT--NOT YET."
01:10:03.449,01:10:05.493,YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE WHAT I JUST...
01:10:05.493,01:10:07.495,WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
01:10:10.665,01:10:13.043,"SNIFFING CHICKS' UNDERWEAR, MAN."
01:10:13.043,01:10:14.961,WHAT IS THE BIG D...
01:10:14.961,01:10:16.420,IT'S... WHAT?
01:10:21.968,01:10:23.511,"THEY'RE GUYS, AREN'T THEY?"
01:10:23.511,01:10:26.931,WOW. YOU REALLY ARE DISGUSTING.
01:10:34.105,01:10:35.732,"YO, LATRELL."
01:10:35.732,01:10:37.984,WHAT'S UP?
01:10:37.984,01:10:39.777,"EX-EXCUSE ME, BABY."
01:10:39.777,01:10:41.237,HOW YOU DOIN'?
01:10:42.405,01:10:44.032,"LATRELL, MY MAN!"
01:10:44.032,01:10:45.992,"WHAT'S GOING ON, BROTHER?"
01:10:45.992,01:10:47.869,"HEY, 2 APPLE MARTINIS."
01:10:47.869,01:10:49.787,"YOU HITTIN' THAT, BRO?"
01:10:49.787,01:10:51.372,THIS IS A TOUGH ONE TO CRACK.
01:10:51.372,01:10:54.042,TIFFANY WILSON?
01:10:55.543,01:10:58.046,"DROP A COUPLE OF THESE BABIES IN HER DRINK, MAN."
01:10:58.046,01:10:59.797,"HEY, HEY, YOU SURE THIS WILL WORK?"
01:10:59.797,01:11:06.221,"MAN, I JUST TOOK 2 OF THEM, AND I'M TELLING YOU, I'M BOINKING SOMEONE TONIGHT, YOU KNOW?"
01:11:06.221,01:11:07.722,EXCUSE ME.
01:11:14.187,01:11:17.899,"THAT'S FOR YOU, MY LITTLE MIRACLE WHIP."
01:11:17.899,01:11:20.526,YOU NEED TO LOOSEN UP.
01:11:22.153,01:11:23.446,THAT'S FOR YOU.
01:11:23.446,01:11:25.073,"OH, MY GOD!"
01:11:25.073,01:11:27.033,WHERE?
01:11:27.033,01:11:29.368,"OH, FORGET IT, SHE JUST LEFT."
01:11:30.995,01:11:33.039,"OOPS, SHE DID IT AGAIN."
01:11:37.835,01:11:40.922,LET'S DRINK UP.
01:11:40.922,01:11:42.465,TO THE LAST DROP.
01:11:48.888,01:11:50.306,THAT'S GOOD.
01:11:50.306,01:11:51.933,YOU WANNA DANCE?
01:11:51.933,01:11:53.768,"YOU KNOW, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA."
01:11:53.768,01:11:55.103,"HERE, HOLD BABY."
01:11:55.103,01:11:56.104,LET'S GO.
01:11:57.688,01:11:59.107,WHOO!

01:12:07.115,01:12:09.951,TED BURTON TURNED THE TABLES ON VANDERGELD.
01:12:09.951,01:12:11.828,TUCKED AWAY $100 MILLION.
01:12:11.828,01:12:14.705,BEEN LIVIN' THE HIGH LIFE EVER SINCE HE GOT OUT OF PRISON.
01:12:14.705,01:12:16.666,THERE GOES OUR MOTIVE.
01:12:26.259,01:12:28.970,THOSE SKANKS THINK THAT THEY'RE HOT?
01:12:30.888,01:12:33.308,"OH, LET'S SHOW THEM WHAT SEXY REALLY IS."
01:12:59.250,01:13:02.295,THEY WANT TO BATTLE.
01:13:17.894,01:13:19.937,YOU GIRLS WANT SOME OF THIS?
01:13:19.937,01:13:22.357,"BRING IT ON, SISTERS!"
01:13:22.357,01:13:25.235,"OK, LET'S DO IT!"
01:13:25.235,01:13:27.904,"5, 6, 7, 8."

01:14:36.513,01:14:38.515,"HO-HO-HO-HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON."
01:14:38.515,01:14:42.186,I KNOW YOU HOOKERS DON'T THINK THIS IS OVER WITH.
01:14:42.186,01:14:44.105,HAH! LET'S KICK IT OLD SCHOOL.
01:15:09.297,01:15:10.589,THEY SUCK!

01:15:34.071,01:15:46.000,"BUT WE JUST WALK OH, MY GOD!"
01:15:54.425,01:15:55.926,WE WON! WE WON!

01:16:05.644,01:16:06.937,HEATH!
01:16:06.937,01:16:09.273,HEATH!
01:16:09.273,01:16:10.400,HEATH.
01:16:10.400,01:16:13.777,GET OUT OF MY WAY!
01:16:13.777,01:16:15.488,I NEED A DRINK.
01:16:21.202,01:16:24.163,"HEY, HEY, HEY, LATRELL, MY MAN."
01:16:25.789,01:16:28.125,"SO DID IT WORK, MAN?"
01:16:29.419,01:16:30.878,I DON'T KNOW.
01:16:31.921,01:16:34.424,BUT I GOT TO DANCE.
01:16:34.424,01:16:37.009,I GOT TO HIT THIS.
01:16:38.677,01:16:41.764,HOLD THE DOG.
01:16:43.349,01:16:45.768,OOH.
01:16:45.768,01:16:47.895,"LET IT OUT, HONEY."
01:16:47.895,01:16:49.313,"OH, YEAH."
01:16:50.773,01:16:55.861,I PAID THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON THIS OUTFIT AND DO YOU THINK HE EVEN NOTICED?
01:16:55.861,01:16:57.196,IT'S GOING TO BE OK.
01:16:57.196,01:17:04.412,LITTLE MISS VANDERGELD WALKS IN AND HE JUST FORGETS ALL ABOUT ME.
01:17:04.412,01:17:06.497,OK. LET IT OUT. LET IT OUT.
01:17:08.207,01:17:18.509,I WONDER IF HE WOULD THINK SHE WAS SO HOT IF HE KNEW THAT SHE IS BROKE.
01:17:19.760,01:17:21.387,VANDERGELD'S BROKE?
01:17:22.472,01:17:24.014,SHH.
01:17:24.014,01:17:26.850,WE MUSTN'T TALK OF SUCH THINGS.
01:17:26.850,01:17:29.353,"NO, NO. WE WON'T."
01:17:29.353,01:17:32.398,"BUT, YES, THEY'RE BROKE."
