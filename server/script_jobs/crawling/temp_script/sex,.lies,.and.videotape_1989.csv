00:00:48.382,00:00:51.010,"I mean, I just can't stop thinking about it."
00:00:51.010,00:00:53.261,THERAPIST: What kind of thoughts about garbage?
00:00:55.556,00:00:59.727,I've gotten real concerned over what's gonna happen with all the garbage.
00:00:59.727,00:01:03.731,"I mean, we've got so much of it."
00:01:03.731,00:01:08.068,"You know, I mean, we have to run out of places to put this stuff eventually."
00:01:08.068,00:01:19.663,"The last time I started feeling this way is when that barge was stranded and, you know, it was going around the island, and nobody would claim it."
00:01:19.663,00:01:20.873,Do you remember that?
00:01:20.873,00:01:24.376,"Yes, I remember."
00:01:24.376,00:01:28.047,Do you have any idea what may have triggered this concern?
00:01:28.047,00:01:30.841,Yeah. Yeah.
00:01:30.841,00:01:38.057,"You see, the other night John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container."
00:01:38.057,00:01:43.228,And that made me...
00:01:38.057,00:01:48.776,"I started imagining, like, a garbage can that produces garbage, and it doesn't stop."
00:01:47.024,00:01:50.819,"It just keeps producing garbage, and it just keeps overflowing."
00:01:50.819,00:01:56.075,"And what would you do, you know, to try to stop something like that?"
00:01:57.451,00:01:59.453,And do you see any pattern here?
00:02:01.204,00:02:03.540,What do you mean?
00:02:03.540,00:02:08.670,Last week we were talking about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities.
00:02:08.670,00:02:12.091,"Now, we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem."
00:02:12.091,00:02:14.301,Yeah. So?
00:02:14.301,00:02:25.228,"Well, if you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative which you have no control over."
00:02:25.228,00:02:27.648,Yeah.
00:02:27.648,00:02:33.487,"But how many people, do you think, run around obsessing over how great and how happy things are?"
00:02:35.196,00:02:38.826,"Maybe they do, but I don't think they're in therapy."
00:02:38.826,00:02:45.165,"Anyway, being happy isn't all that great."
00:02:45.165,00:02:50.671,"I mean, the last time I was really happy I got so fat."
00:02:50.671,00:02:54.675,I must have put on 25 pounds.
00:02:54.675,00:02:57.803,I thought John was gonna have a stroke.
00:02:59.888,00:03:01.849,So what are you worried about?
00:03:01.849,00:03:04.601,MAN: What am I looking at here?
00:03:04.601,00:03:08.480,"Oh, it depends on your point of view. I don't think so."
00:03:08.480,00:03:10.189,"In fact, I'm gonna tell you a little secret."
00:03:10.189,00:03:11.733,Yeah?
00:03:11.733,00:03:17.405,"As soon as you've got a ring on your finger, you start getting the most spectacular attention from the opposite gender."
00:03:17.405,00:03:19.700,Seriously.
00:03:19.700,00:03:24.329,"God, I wish I had Super Bowl seats for every time some filly would come up and start talking to me without the slightest provocation."
00:03:25.831,00:03:27.708,It's critical.
00:03:27.708,00:03:29.584,"Yeah, but that happened to you before you got married."
00:03:29.584,00:03:32.211,"No! No, no, no, no."
00:03:32.211,00:03:35.924,"If I'd known that, I'd have gone out and bought myself a ring when I was 18 and saved myself..."
00:03:37.968,00:03:39.803,...a lot of time and money.
00:03:39.803,00:03:41.889,"No, I wish somebody had clued me in."
00:03:41.889,00:03:46.143,I'm telling you.
00:03:46.143,00:03:49.479,"Oh, shit, I gotta be someplace. So, listen, racquetball Thursday, right?"
00:03:49.479,00:03:51.773,How about 7:30?
00:03:51.773,00:03:53.859,Great. Bye-bye.
00:04:00.157,00:04:01.491,"JANET ON SPEAKER PHONE: Yes, sir?"
00:04:01.491,00:04:02.826,Janet.
00:04:02.826,00:04:07.873,"Reschedule Kirkland for Friday, 1:30."
00:04:07.873,00:04:10.167,"Yes, sir."
00:04:17.716,00:04:21.095,THERAPIST: Are you still keeping these thoughts from John?
00:04:21.095,00:04:22.429,ANN: Yeah.
00:04:22.429,00:04:27.642,"Well, are you afraid of his reaction of his finding you silly at thinking these things?"
00:04:27.642,00:04:29.895,"No, it's not that."
00:04:29.895,00:04:31.230,"Well, I'm really angry at him right now."
00:04:31.230,00:04:33.356,Oh? Why?
00:04:33.356,00:04:38.486,"Well, he invited this college friend of his to come stay at our house, and, well, he didn't even ask me."
00:04:38.486,00:04:45.077,"I'm gonna say yes, of course, but, you know, it just would have been nice to have been asked."
00:04:45.077,00:04:48.288,What upset you about that?
00:04:48.288,00:04:52.667,I guess it makes me angry because I can't justify being angry.
00:04:52.667,00:04:55.670,It's his house.
00:04:55.670,00:05:00.175,"Yes, but he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework."
00:05:00.175,00:05:03.511,Yeah. I have housework.
00:05:03.511,00:05:08.558,"Now, this unexpected guest notwithstanding, how are things with John?"
00:05:08.558,00:05:10.560,"Oh, they're fine."
00:05:10.560,00:05:14.355,"Except for I'm kind of going through this thing where I don't want him to touch me, but..."
00:05:14.355,00:05:18.652,"Well, when did you begin having this feeling?"
00:05:18.652,00:05:21.362,"Well, last week."
00:05:21.362,00:05:23.490,I don't know.
00:05:23.490,00:05:26.660,I got this really strange feeling...
00:05:28.245,00:05:30.956,...and just didn't want him to touch me.
00:05:30.956,00:05:36.837,"Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable with your physical contact with John?"
00:05:36.837,00:05:39.589,"Oh, yeah. Sure. Yeah."
00:05:41.216,00:05:45.344,Except for...
00:05:45.344,00:05:48.347,I've never really been that much into sex.
00:05:48.347,00:06:02.154,"I mean, I like it and everything, but, you know, I just don't think it's such a big deal, and I wouldn't miss it, you know, kind of thing."
00:06:02.154,00:06:04.572,But...
00:06:04.572,00:06:10.204,"Well, lately I've just been kind of curious about how things have slacked off."
00:06:10.204,00:06:14.875,"Well, perhaps he senses your hesitancy to being touched."
00:06:14.875,00:06:22.423,"Yeah, but, you see, that's the weird thing, because he started not touching me before I started feeling like that."
00:06:22.423,00:06:24.926,Ah.
00:06:24.926,00:06:29.973,"I mean, I'm sure he probably wishes that I would initiate things once in a while."
00:06:29.973,00:06:33.268,"And I would, except for..."
00:06:33.268,00:06:36.146,It just never occurs to me and...
00:06:36.146,00:06:40.650,"Well, the few times I have felt like it, I was by myself."
00:06:41.943,00:06:44.029,Did you do anything?
00:06:46.781,00:06:48.950,What do you mean?
00:06:48.950,00:06:51.328,Did you masturbate?
00:06:57.042,00:07:00.503,Oh! Oh!
00:07:00.503,00:07:02.297,"God, no!"
00:07:03.464,00:07:05.759,No. Mm-mmm.
00:07:05.759,00:07:10.097,I take it from your response that you never masturbate.
00:07:15.060,00:07:17.104,Well...
00:07:17.104,00:07:21.775,I tried once.
00:07:23.693,00:07:25.195,I don't know.
00:07:25.195,00:07:28.448,It just seemed like a dumb thing to do.
00:07:28.448,00:07:34.413,"God, you know, then I started worrying that my dead grandfather was maybe watching me, you know, and..."
00:07:36.164,00:07:38.499,"Oh, it just seemed so stupid."
00:07:38.499,00:07:41.128,"You know, especially when you don't know what to do with all the garbage."
00:07:41.128,00:07:45.673,"Oh, so it was recently when you tried this?"
00:07:45.673,00:07:50.345,"Oh... Well, it was kind of recently, but not real recently."
00:07:54.641,00:07:58.645,I am just not up to having a guest in the house.
00:08:04.525,00:08:07.237,I gotta go to the office.
00:08:07.237,00:08:10.573,I gotta get back to the office.
00:08:10.573,00:08:14.702,I only get one today?
00:08:14.702,00:08:17.497,I already skipped one meeting.
00:08:19.333,00:08:23.962,"Look, John, if you wanna leave, leave."
00:08:23.962,00:08:27.548,My life doesn't revolve around these little get-togethers.
00:08:27.548,00:08:31.886,"I mean, don't flatter yourself."
00:08:31.886,00:08:34.931,"like you gotta treat me with kid gloves, Cyn."
00:08:34.931,00:08:38.268,"I mean, tell me how you really feel."
00:08:38.268,00:08:45.859,"Listen, I got a friend coming into town, an old friend of mine that I haven't seen in years."
00:08:45.859,00:08:50.071,"From what I can tell, I think he's a little lost."
00:08:50.071,00:08:53.158,I think I may have to spend a little time with him.
00:08:53.158,00:08:54.617,Mm-hmm.
00:08:54.617,00:08:56.953,Meaning we'll have to cool it for a while?
00:08:57.996,00:08:59.331,Yeah.
00:09:03.751,00:09:06.796,"You know, I wish you'd quit that bartending job of yours."
00:09:06.796,00:09:08.631,Why?
00:09:08.631,00:09:11.259,I just hate the thought of all those guys hitting on you.
00:09:13.303,00:09:15.055,I can handle it.
00:09:15.055,00:09:16.973,I'm sure.
00:09:16.973,00:09:21.811,"Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute."
00:09:21.811,00:09:24.647,And you are in no position to be jealous.
00:09:26.400,00:09:27.984,Who said I was jealous?
00:09:27.984,00:09:30.278,I did.
00:09:33.156,00:09:38.286,"You know, I'd like to do it at your house sometime."
00:09:38.286,00:09:43.542,"I must admit, the idea of doing it in my sister's bed gives me a perverse thrill."
00:09:48.004,00:09:59.682,"I wish I could just come right out and tell everyone Ann's a lousy lay, the beautiful, the popular Ann Bishop Mullany."
00:10:00.808,00:10:02.769,Could be risky.
00:10:03.937,00:10:06.022,"How about I just start a rumor, then?"
00:10:06.022,00:10:09.484,"No, no. I mean, doing it at my house."
00:10:09.484,00:10:11.694,Afraid of getting caught?
00:10:11.694,00:10:13.363,Yeah.
00:10:13.363,00:10:15.490,You should be.
00:10:17.367,00:10:19.453,Can I meet this friend of yours?
00:10:19.453,00:10:21.288,Who? Graham?
00:10:21.288,00:10:25.083,"I gotta tell you, we were very close many years ago, but I..."
00:10:25.083,00:10:28.253,we're very different now.
00:10:58.699,00:10:59.826,Yes?
00:10:59.826,00:11:01.995,Ann? My name is Graham Dalton.
00:11:01.995,00:11:03.288,"Oh, oh. Yeah."
00:11:03.288,00:11:05.665,Sure. Uh-huh.
00:11:05.665,00:11:07.501,Come on in. Come on.
00:11:12.088,00:11:13.507,Where is it?
00:11:13.507,00:11:14.799,there to the left.
00:11:14.799,00:11:16.176,I'm sorry.
00:11:16.176,00:11:18.178,Do you like strawberries?
00:11:18.178,00:11:20.972,Oh! Thank you.
00:11:38.281,00:11:41.868,"Hi. John Mullany, please."
00:11:45.997,00:11:48.291,That's all right.
00:11:52.504,00:11:54.464,Well...
00:11:54.464,00:11:55.674,That was quick.
00:11:55.674,00:11:56.841,False alarm.
00:11:56.841,00:11:58.385,Have a seat.
00:12:03.014,00:12:05.933,"I'm sorry. You know, we don't let people smoke in the house."
00:12:05.933,00:12:07.101,"But if you'd like to, we could..."
00:12:07.101,00:12:08.144,"Oh, no, no, no."
00:12:08.144,00:12:09.312,...go outside.
00:12:09.312,00:12:10.564,I...
00:12:10.564,00:12:12.691,I can wait.
00:12:14.526,00:12:16.110,Do you have any other things?
00:12:16.110,00:12:17.696,Yes.
00:12:17.696,00:12:20.281,"Oh, you mean to bring in?"
00:12:20.281,00:12:24.536,"I mean, I do have some other things, but this is all I need to stay here."
00:12:26.705,00:12:28.707,Have you ever been on television?
00:12:30.917,00:12:35.255,Television? No. No. Why? Why?
00:12:36.548,00:12:39.259,I was just curious.
00:12:42.095,00:12:45.973,Graham.
00:12:45.973,00:12:49.269,"Yeah, yeah."
00:12:49.269,00:12:54.232,My mother is a complete Anglophile.
00:12:54.232,00:12:58.361,"Anything British makes her drool like a baby, so she..."
00:12:58.361,00:13:01.072,I think she heard the name in a movie or something.
00:13:01.072,00:13:04.075,She's a prisoner of public television now.
00:13:04.075,00:13:06.578,How do you like being married?
00:13:07.995,00:13:10.457,I like it just fine.
00:13:10.457,00:13:11.708,What about it do you like?
00:13:13.585,00:13:14.961,I don't mean to be critical.
00:13:14.961,00:13:17.464,"No, no. That's okay."
00:13:21.926,00:13:26.681,"Well, you know the cliche about the security of it."
00:13:26.681,00:13:28.516,"Well, that's true."
00:13:30.017,00:13:32.312,And we own this house.
00:13:33.647,00:13:35.565,It's a nice house.
00:13:35.565,00:13:37.900,And...
00:13:37.900,00:13:42.530,"John was just made junior partner, and I really like that."
00:13:42.530,00:13:47.661,"You know, I like the fact that he's just not freelance or whatever."
00:13:47.661,00:13:49.120,Yes.
00:13:53.458,00:13:57.295,So how long has it been since you've seen John?
00:13:57.295,00:13:59.380,Nine years.
00:13:59.380,00:14:04.218,Yeah. I was surprised he invited me to stay here until I found a place.
00:14:04.218,00:14:05.720,Didn't you...
00:14:05.720,00:14:06.971,Didn't you know him very well?
00:14:06.971,00:14:09.140,"Oh, no. I knew him very well."
00:14:09.140,00:14:14.395,John and I were very much alike.
00:14:14.395,00:14:15.689,Really?
00:14:17.816,00:14:22.069,It's kind of hard to believe.
00:14:24.614,00:14:29.327,Yeah. I would imagine we are pretty different now.
00:14:29.327,00:14:32.079,I'm ready to use the bathroom finally.
00:14:32.079,00:14:33.289,Okay.
00:14:48.179,00:14:54.811,"Graham, I gotta tell you, I almost called the cops when I saw you today."
00:14:54.811,00:15:04.195,"I thought to myself, This couldn't possibly be the same guy that once held private services in the back of the chapel on a weekly basis."
00:15:04.195,00:15:06.322,ANN: You did that?
00:15:06.322,00:15:09.367,"Everybody has a past, and that's mine, so..."
00:15:09.367,00:15:12.495,with the getup?
00:15:12.495,00:15:14.539,Somebody die or...
00:15:14.539,00:15:16.165,ANN: John.
00:15:16.165,00:15:19.544,"No, no, no."
00:15:21.546,00:15:23.631,So...
00:15:23.631,00:15:29.303,What do you think the Greeks would think of this rather somber attire?
00:15:29.303,00:15:32.181,I don't know.
00:15:32.181,00:15:34.058,Dinner was very good.
00:15:34.058,00:15:36.018,"Yeah. It wasn't bad, honey."
00:15:36.018,00:15:42.400,"Usually Ann achieves a kind of critical mass with the salt, but tonight was..."
00:15:40.189,00:15:45.945,"I always tell her, You can always add more, but you can't take it away."
00:15:45.945,00:15:48.072,"Yeah. You say that, don't you?"
00:15:49.657,00:15:50.867,"So, do you have family here?"
00:15:50.867,00:15:54.120,"Mmm. Mother, father, my sister."
00:15:54.120,00:15:57.665,Mmm.
00:15:57.665,00:15:59.292,Younger.
00:16:00.919,00:16:04.046,Are you close?
00:16:04.046,00:16:07.425,I'm sorry...
00:16:07.425,00:16:09.510,Were you prying before?
00:16:09.510,00:16:12.221,"Yeah, this afternoon I was grilling Ann about your marriage."
00:16:12.221,00:16:13.598,How'd it go?
00:16:13.598,00:16:16.058,"Well, very well."
00:16:19.353,00:16:22.398,So I was asking about your sister.
00:16:22.398,00:16:25.485,Yeah. Well...
00:16:25.485,00:16:28.112,We get along all right.
00:16:29.572,00:16:32.742,she's an extrovert.
00:16:36.704,00:16:38.414,I just think she's loud.
00:16:38.414,00:16:41.709,wouldn't agree.
00:16:41.709,00:16:43.962,No. Definitely wouldn't agree.
00:16:46.339,00:16:50.635,"So, listen, you gonna see Elizabeth while you're here?"
00:16:53.763,00:16:55.097,Who's Elizabeth?
00:16:55.097,00:16:56.766,It's a girl Graham dated in school.
00:16:56.766,00:17:00.353,"Well, after the chapel episodes."
00:17:00.353,00:17:04.148,"She still lives here, to the best of my knowledge."
00:17:07.151,00:17:18.412,"So, Graham and I were talking about apartments today, and I told him that they've got those lovely little apartments in the Garden District and that they're really nice, the garage apartments..."
00:17:18.412,00:17:20.164,There's critical crime in the Garden District.
00:17:20.164,00:17:22.375,"Oh, John, come on."
00:17:22.375,00:17:28.548,"I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are plenty of studio apartments available elsewhere."
00:17:28.548,00:17:30.758,I'm sorry?
00:17:30.758,00:17:33.553,"No, it's just right now I have one key."
00:17:33.553,00:17:35.763,"You know, everything I own is in the car."
00:17:35.763,00:17:38.349,I just... I like that.
00:17:38.349,00:17:40.768,"If I get an apartment, that's two keys."
00:17:40.768,00:17:44.689,"If I get a job, you know, I might have to open or close."
00:17:44.689,00:17:46.691,That's more keys.
00:17:46.691,00:17:49.360,Then I'm afraid it's gonna get ripped off or something.
00:17:49.360,00:17:51.029,Then I get more keys.
00:17:51.029,00:17:53.322,"You know, I just like having the one key. It's clean."
00:17:53.322,00:17:56.200,Don't have to worry about losing them. I always lose my keys. I hate that.
00:17:56.200,00:17:58.202,Get rid of the car when you get the apartment.
00:17:58.202,00:18:01.956,No. I like having the car.
00:18:01.956,00:18:04.876,Car is important.
00:18:04.876,00:18:07.879,In case you have to leave someplace in a hurry?
00:18:07.879,00:18:10.840,"Yeah, or go someplace in a hurry."
00:18:12.216,00:18:13.634,Excuse me.
00:18:19.057,00:18:20.140,Do you want some help? Sure?
00:18:20.140,00:18:21.601,"No, no. Really."
00:18:21.601,00:18:24.395,I'm fine. There's not that much to do.
00:18:28.190,00:18:31.527,"Graham, do you pay taxes?"
00:18:31.527,00:18:35.656,"Yeah, I pay taxes."
00:18:35.656,00:18:40.160,"If you don't pay taxes, you're a liar."
00:18:40.160,00:18:43.873,Liars are the second-lowest form of human being on the planet.
00:18:43.873,00:18:44.958,ANN: What's the first?
00:18:44.958,00:18:47.001,Lawyers.
00:18:47.001,00:18:49.295,"Oh, that's you, honey."
00:18:53.424,00:18:56.510,"Annie, why don't you go with Graham to hunt for apartments?"
00:18:56.510,00:18:58.846,Show him how the city's changed.
00:18:58.846,00:19:00.014,"Would you mind, Graham?"
00:19:00.014,00:19:01.515,"No, I'd love that."
00:19:01.515,00:19:03.476,"I'd like that, too."
00:19:03.476,00:19:05.394,All right.
00:19:05.394,00:19:07.605,That'd be great.
00:19:10.024,00:19:11.651,"One key, huh?"
00:19:12.986,00:19:15.071,Great idea.
00:19:24.622,00:19:25.581,Yeah.
00:19:25.581,00:19:27.041,"Cyndi, John."
00:19:27.041,00:19:30.086,Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
00:19:30.086,00:19:33.798,You are scum.
00:19:40.220,00:19:43.641,"As you can see, there's plenty of room for two."
00:19:45.101,00:19:47.436,GRAHAM: No.
00:19:47.436,00:19:49.438,No party of two?
00:19:51.149,00:19:54.110,You can hang a shower curtain in the bath.
00:19:54.110,00:19:56.612,And make sure you put something in the tub so you won't fall.
00:19:56.612,00:19:58.114,Okay.
00:19:58.114,00:20:00.533,You said about 350?
00:20:00.533,00:20:05.579,"Yeah, and plus the first and the last month's rent."
00:20:08.791,00:20:11.210,All right. Will you lease month to month?
00:20:11.210,00:20:13.420,Not for 350.
00:20:13.420,00:20:15.673,How about 400?
00:20:21.054,00:20:23.556,I can live with that.
00:20:23.556,00:20:25.558,Okay. It's a deal.
00:20:25.558,00:20:27.434,Ready?
00:20:39.613,00:20:41.115,John?
00:20:41.115,00:20:42.658,In here.
00:20:56.964,00:20:59.466,"Well, ain't you a picture?"
00:21:26.577,00:21:28.621,"Well, do you like it?"
00:21:31.749,00:21:34.168,It's lovely.
00:21:34.168,00:21:36.295,Is it for me?
00:21:37.504,00:21:39.590,Yeah. It's for you.
00:22:02.905,00:22:04.698,Is that for me?
00:22:04.698,00:22:07.743,Yeah. It's for you.
00:22:29.265,00:22:32.143,"You're amazing, dear."
00:22:42.987,00:22:45.447,ANN: Can I tell you something personal?
00:22:48.617,00:22:51.495,It's up to you.
00:22:51.495,00:22:53.122,Yeah. Yeah.
00:22:57.501,00:22:59.545,"Well, you gotta go first."
00:23:00.254,00:23:01.672,Okay.
00:23:05.467,00:23:06.760,Oh!
00:23:08.346,00:23:10.848,I think that...
00:23:10.848,00:23:13.517,I think that sex is overrated.
00:23:13.517,00:23:16.979,I think that people place far too much importance on it.
00:23:16.979,00:23:20.816,And I think that stuff about women want it just as bad as men is crap.
00:23:20.816,00:23:23.194,"I mean, I think that women want it."
00:23:23.194,00:23:27.323,I just don't think that they want it for the same reason that men think they do.
00:23:27.323,00:23:31.285,And I'm getting confused.
00:23:31.285,00:23:33.620,Do you understand what I'm...
00:23:33.620,00:23:35.413,Yeah. Yeah.
00:23:36.540,00:23:53.391,Yeah. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love the person that they're attracted to and that women become more and more attracted to the person that they love.
00:23:55.017,00:23:58.896,God. That's beautiful.
00:23:58.896,00:24:01.439,That's really beautiful.
00:24:01.439,00:24:03.650,I like that.
00:24:03.650,00:24:05.236,I'm just quoting.
00:24:06.570,00:24:08.864,So are you gonna tell me something personal?
00:24:08.864,00:24:11.825,Do you want me to?
00:24:11.825,00:24:14.995,"I mean, I don't want it to be something gross about some scar or something."
00:24:14.995,00:24:18.707,I want it to be something really personal about yourself.
00:24:18.707,00:24:21.252,All right. Okay.
00:24:21.252,00:24:22.878,I'm impotent.
00:24:22.878,00:24:25.089,You're what?
00:24:25.089,00:24:26.424,Impotent.
00:24:28.008,00:24:29.635,You are?
00:24:29.635,00:24:33.431,Yeah. I mean...
00:24:33.431,00:24:38.644,I can't get an erection in the presence of another person.
00:24:40.771,00:24:44.442,"So, for all practical purposes, I'm impotent."
00:24:47.736,00:24:49.863,Does that bother you?
00:24:51.573,00:24:52.908,No.
00:24:54.827,00:24:58.247,Does it make you feel self-conscious?
00:25:07.923,00:25:09.633,Not usually.
00:25:11.135,00:25:16.598,"No... Yeah, I'm self-conscious."
00:25:16.598,00:25:20.518,"Not in the same way that you are, though."
00:25:20.518,00:25:23.147,Me? Me? You think I'm self-conscious?
00:25:23.147,00:25:26.442,Well...
00:25:26.442,00:25:29.111,I've been watching you.
00:25:29.111,00:25:31.697,I watch you eat.
00:25:32.823,00:25:35.826,"Watch you move, and I..."
00:25:35.826,00:25:42.458,I see somebody who is extremely aware of people looking at you.
00:25:43.709,00:25:46.586,"You know, my therapist..."
00:25:46.586,00:25:48.464,You're in therapy?
00:25:48.464,00:25:50.841,Aren't you?
00:25:50.841,00:25:55.429,"No. No, I'm not. No."
00:25:55.429,00:25:59.557,I was a miserable failure in therapy.
00:25:59.557,00:26:01.101,So you don't believe in therapy?
00:26:01.101,00:26:05.563,"No, I... I believe in it for some people."
00:26:05.563,00:26:09.443,I don't know.
00:26:09.443,00:26:11.529,I was confused going in.
00:26:13.447,00:26:21.663,So I just formed my own theory that you should never take advice from someone that doesn't know you intimately.
00:26:22.873,00:26:27.169,"Well, I know my therapist intimately."
00:26:29.380,00:26:31.131,You've had sex with your therapist?
00:26:31.131,00:26:34.385,No! No! No!
00:26:34.385,00:26:37.263,I'm... That's what I meant.
00:26:37.263,00:26:39.973,Someone you've had sex with.
00:26:39.973,00:26:41.225,Oh.
00:26:47.523,00:26:50.859,I'm... I don't understand.
00:26:50.859,00:26:54.947,"I mean, how would you know?"
00:26:54.947,00:26:58.284,"I mean, you know. How..."
00:26:58.284,00:27:01.078,No. I wasn't always impotent.
00:27:01.078,00:27:02.329,Oh!
00:27:02.329,00:27:04.081,Okay.
00:27:05.458,00:27:07.251,So let me see.
00:27:07.251,00:27:15.426,You said... You said that I should never take advice from someone that I haven't had sex with.
00:27:15.426,00:27:17.553,Right? Right?
00:27:17.553,00:27:19.805,Basically.
00:27:19.805,00:27:23.267,And we haven't had sex.
00:27:23.267,00:27:24.560,Right?
00:27:24.560,00:27:26.103,No.
00:27:26.103,00:27:31.691,"So I guess from your own advice, I shouldn't take your advice."
00:27:31.691,00:27:32.776,I wouldn't.
00:27:32.776,00:27:34.361,You wouldn't.
00:27:37.030,00:27:38.574,All right.
00:27:41.034,00:27:43.787,And drive safely.
00:29:08.664,00:29:10.749,THERAPIST: How was your weekend?
00:29:10.749,00:29:12.959,ANN: It was okay.
00:29:14.961,00:29:18.507,Did you confront John about the visitor?
00:29:18.507,00:29:20.217,The visitor?
00:29:20.217,00:29:21.427,The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
00:29:21.427,00:29:22.969,Oh!
00:29:22.969,00:29:25.805,Graham.
00:29:25.805,00:29:30.269,Yeah. I mean... No.
00:29:30.269,00:29:33.439,That actually turned out to be interesting.
00:29:36.066,00:29:49.538,"You know, I was expecting him to be just like John, you know, 'cause they went to school together and everything, you know, talking about getting drunk together and secret handshakes and..."
00:29:54.334,00:30:00.257,"He turned out to be, really, this character."
00:30:01.967,00:30:06.972,"He's kind of arty, but okay."
00:30:06.972,00:30:09.642,Is he still at your house?
00:30:09.642,00:30:13.312,"No. No, no. He's gone."
00:30:15.188,00:30:17.899,So where's he from?
00:30:17.899,00:30:19.526,I don't know.
00:30:19.526,00:30:24.364,He used to live in New York and Philadelphia.
00:30:24.364,00:30:26.700,"I think he just, kind of, travels around."
00:30:26.700,00:30:28.619,Must be nice.
00:30:28.619,00:30:30.746,So what's he like?
00:30:30.746,00:30:36.042,No. I don't think John likes him anymore.
00:30:36.042,00:30:38.962,He says he thinks he's gotten kind of strange.
00:30:38.962,00:30:41.674,"Is he? Strange, I mean."
00:30:41.674,00:30:43.258,No.
00:30:43.258,00:30:46.470,"I mean, if I saw him on the street I might think so."
00:30:46.470,00:30:50.056,"But after meeting and talking to him, I just say he's kind of unusual."
00:30:50.056,00:30:52.017,Mm-hmm.
00:30:52.017,00:30:53.769,So what's he look like?
00:30:53.769,00:30:55.937,Why?
00:30:55.937,00:30:57.439,"I just wanna know what he looks like, is all."
00:30:57.439,00:30:59.525,Why? So you can go after him?
00:30:59.525,00:31:03.445,"Jesus, Ann. Get a life."
00:31:03.445,00:31:11.328,"Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?"
00:31:11.328,00:31:13.288,Why do you have to say that?
00:31:13.288,00:31:14.832,Say what?
00:31:14.832,00:31:16.750,You say it just to irritate me.
00:31:16.750,00:31:20.420,I say it because it's descriptive.
00:31:20.420,00:31:24.591,"Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person who'd go in for that kind of thing, anyway."
00:31:24.591,00:31:26.926,"Ann, you always underestimate me."
00:31:26.926,00:31:29.012,I wonder why.
00:31:31.306,00:31:33.642,I think you're afraid to put us in the same room together.
00:31:33.642,00:31:36.144,I think you're afraid he'd be undeniably drawn to me.
00:31:36.144,00:31:38.647,"Really, Cynthia, I don't think he's your type."
00:31:42.942,00:31:46.279,My type? How would you know what my type is?
00:31:46.279,00:31:48.574,"Oh, I have a pretty good idea."
00:31:50.450,00:31:52.870,"Ann, you don't have a clue."
00:31:52.870,00:31:56.665,"Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this."
00:31:56.665,00:32:00.711,"I mean, I'll just go over and call him myself."
00:32:00.711,00:32:03.505,He doesn't have a phone.
00:32:03.505,00:32:05.883,"Well, I'll call him when he does."
00:32:07.467,00:32:09.553,He won't.
00:32:09.553,00:32:11.722,What are you talking about?
00:32:11.722,00:32:15.392,He doesn't like to talk on the phone.
00:32:15.392,00:32:18.311,"Oh, please."
00:32:18.311,00:32:22.608,"Okay, so give me the Zen master's address. I'll think of a reason to stop by."
00:32:24.359,00:32:27.028,Please. Just let me talk to him first.
00:32:27.028,00:32:32.033,Why? Just give me the address. You won't even have to be involved.
00:32:42.502,00:32:47.340,I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
00:32:47.340,00:32:48.884,And what?
00:32:48.884,00:32:50.719,Do whatever it is you do.
00:32:50.719,00:32:52.220,Do whatever it is you do.
00:32:52.220,00:32:53.639,Listen to the way you talk.
00:32:53.639,00:32:54.932,I talk fine.
00:32:54.932,00:32:57.309,Thank you.
00:32:59.269,00:33:01.688,What did you lose?
00:33:01.688,00:33:06.526,My goddamn pearl earring.
00:33:06.526,00:33:08.946,It cost me a fucking fortune.
00:33:08.946,00:33:13.032,I must have left it somewhere.
00:33:13.032,00:33:15.869,So what are you getting Mama for her birthday?
00:33:15.869,00:33:18.831,I don't know. I'll get her a card or something.
00:33:18.831,00:33:20.707,A card for her 50th birthday?
00:33:20.707,00:33:22.208,Yeah. What's wrong with that?
00:33:22.208,00:33:24.336,"Well, the woman gave birth to you."
00:33:24.336,00:33:26.463,I think you might be giving her something...
00:33:26.463,00:33:29.257,Will you stop? Jesus.
00:33:29.257,00:33:30.801,I just thought that maybe for once...
00:33:30.801,00:33:33.386,"Okay, Ann. Okay."
00:33:33.386,00:33:35.806,How about this?
00:33:35.806,00:33:41.102,"You get her something nice, and I'll pay for half, all right?"
00:33:41.102,00:33:43.313,Fine. Fine.
00:33:43.313,00:33:45.565,Fine.
00:33:45.565,00:33:48.652,"Okay, now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work."
00:33:54.658,00:34:00.664,GRAHAM: What is the most unusual location you've ever masturbated in?
00:34:02.248,00:34:13.051,"Well, one time I was flying from Los Angeles to New York."
00:34:14.720,00:34:22.268,"And I was... It was a really crowded flight, and I was sitting in the middle."
00:34:22.268,00:34:24.270,I didn't get a window.
00:34:24.270,00:34:26.023,It was really funny.
00:34:26.023,00:34:30.276,I was just bored.
00:34:30.276,00:34:32.821,"I think I had, like, a woman's magazine."
00:34:32.821,00:34:36.366,"You know, they touch on a lot of sexual issues and stuff like that."
00:34:36.366,00:34:41.371,"And I was just thinking to myself, God, that's what I need."
00:34:38.201,00:34:44.457,"I need a little, you know, something to take my mind off this trip."
00:34:44.457,00:34:47.920,So I was just thinking away.
00:34:47.920,00:34:50.672,And then I just...
00:34:50.672,00:34:54.467,I just did it on the plane just between these two people.
00:34:55.719,00:34:57.095,And nobody knew. I mean...
00:35:00.640,00:35:07.981,How were you able to not betray what was going on to the people around you?
00:35:07.981,00:35:13.319,"Well, you know, I have really strong muscles."
00:35:14.404,00:35:16.531,It's open.
00:35:17.156,00:35:18.617,Hi.
00:35:18.617,00:35:20.201,"Hello, Ann."
00:35:20.201,00:35:21.703,I hope I'm not bothering you.
00:35:21.703,00:35:22.829,No. No.
00:35:22.829,00:35:24.664,I would have phoned.
00:35:24.664,00:35:25.749,You busy?
00:35:25.749,00:35:27.834,No. I can finish later.
00:35:27.834,00:35:31.755,I just wanted to come by and see what the apartment looked like with furniture.
00:35:31.755,00:35:35.300,Yeah. I'm afraid there's not much to see.
00:35:35.300,00:35:39.596,I'm sort of cultivating this minimalist vibe.
00:35:40.680,00:35:41.974,You could use a bookshelf.
00:35:41.974,00:35:44.225,Yeah? You think so?
00:35:45.769,00:35:48.855,I don't know.
00:35:52.734,00:35:54.611,What are these?
00:35:54.611,00:35:56.613,Those are videotapes.
00:35:56.613,00:36:00.617,I can see that.
00:36:00.617,00:36:04.955,It's a personal project I've been working on.
00:36:04.955,00:36:07.415,What kind of personal project?
00:36:09.292,00:36:10.418,What?
00:36:10.418,00:36:12.712,What kind of personal project?
00:36:16.591,00:36:20.012,Personal project like anyone else's personal project.
00:36:20.012,00:36:24.599,"Mine's just a little more personal, I guess."
00:36:25.684,00:36:28.061,Who's Donna?
00:36:28.061,00:36:29.354,What?
00:36:29.354,00:36:31.773,Donna. It says Donna here on the tape.
00:36:31.773,00:36:35.861,Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
00:36:35.861,00:36:37.863,You went out with her?
00:36:40.239,00:36:41.992,No. Not really.
00:36:41.992,00:36:46.913,Why do these tapes all have women's names on them?
00:36:49.457,00:36:52.669,"Well, I enjoy interviewing women more than men."
00:36:54.546,00:36:55.964,Oh.
00:36:55.964,00:36:57.382,Thanks.
00:36:57.382,00:36:59.176,I'm sorry.
00:36:59.176,00:37:01.427,No. This is perfect.
00:37:01.427,00:37:05.473,"So all of these are interviews, huh?"
00:37:05.473,00:37:06.766,Yes.
00:37:06.766,00:37:08.267,Can we watch one?
00:37:10.187,00:37:12.605,"No, I'd... No."
00:37:12.605,00:37:14.191,Why not?
00:37:16.401,00:37:23.200,"Well, I promised each of the subjects that no one would see the videotapes except for me."
00:37:25.702,00:37:28.580,What are the interviews about?
00:37:29.831,00:37:31.875,The interviews are about sex.
00:37:35.003,00:37:36.546,Sex?
00:37:39.049,00:37:40.884,What about sex?
00:37:45.222,00:37:48.141,Everything about sex.
00:37:48.141,00:37:50.185,Like what?
00:37:52.395,00:37:55.356,What they've done.
00:37:55.356,00:37:58.526,What they want to do but are afraid to ask for.
00:37:58.526,00:38:01.905,What they wouldn't do even if asked.
00:38:03.198,00:38:06.743,Anything I can think of.
00:38:10.663,00:38:14.126,You just ask them questions?
00:38:14.126,00:38:15.752,Yes.
00:38:17.879,00:38:20.381,And they answer them?
00:38:20.381,00:38:21.758,Yeah.
00:38:23.176,00:38:25.845,Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
00:38:25.845,00:38:27.139,To you?
00:38:27.139,00:38:31.601,No. For the camera.
00:38:31.601,00:38:33.394,"Graham, this is just so..."
00:38:33.394,00:38:36.231,I'm sorry this came up. I'm...
00:38:36.231,00:38:40.860,"No, I'm sorry."
00:38:42.487,00:38:44.114,Here. I'll take...
00:38:44.114,00:38:46.950,Goodbye.
00:38:46.950,00:38:48.785,Okay.
00:38:57.877,00:39:00.463,He doesn't want you to come over.
00:39:00.463,00:39:02.174,CYNTHIA: What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over?
00:39:02.174,00:39:03.466,Did you tell him about me?
00:39:03.466,00:39:04.634,"No, I didn't."
00:39:04.634,00:39:06.052,Why not?
00:39:06.052,00:39:07.345,"Look, Cynthia."
00:39:07.345,00:39:09.055,"Well, why?"
00:39:10.389,00:39:12.600,John's right.
00:39:12.600,00:39:14.102,And you don't wanna get involved with him.
00:39:14.102,00:39:15.770,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:39:15.770,00:39:18.564,Did he make a pass at you?
00:39:18.564,00:39:21.901,"Well, what's the story, then?"
00:39:21.901,00:39:23.195,"I mean, is he drowning puppies?"
00:39:23.195,00:39:25.155,"It's nothing like that, okay?"
00:39:25.155,00:39:28.325,"Well, what?"
00:39:28.325,00:39:29.951,"No, not physically."
00:39:29.951,00:39:33.454,"Well, what, then?"
00:39:33.454,00:39:34.956,I don't wanna talk about it.
00:39:34.956,00:39:36.291,Then why did you call me?
00:39:36.291,00:39:37.542,I don't know.
00:39:47.760,00:39:48.761,Hello?
00:39:48.761,00:39:50.388,"Cynthia, John."
00:39:50.388,00:39:54.267,Not today.
00:39:54.267,00:39:56.394,Oh.
00:39:56.394,00:39:58.521,"Well, when, then?"
00:39:58.521,00:40:01.149,How about inviting me over to dinner?
00:40:01.149,00:40:02.734,You know what I mean.
00:40:02.734,00:40:05.028,"Yeah, I know what you mean."
00:40:13.119,00:40:14.662,It's open.
00:40:18.666,00:40:19.959,Hi.
00:40:19.959,00:40:22.128,Hello.
00:40:24.297,00:40:26.674,I... Can I help you?
00:40:26.674,00:40:29.594,I'm Cynthia Bishop.
00:40:29.594,00:40:31.346,I'm sorry.
00:40:31.346,00:40:33.556,I'm Ann Mullany's sister.
00:40:33.556,00:40:36.101,The extrovert.
00:40:36.101,00:40:39.562,She must've been in a good mood when she said that.
00:40:39.562,00:40:41.189,"Yeah. She called you that, too."
00:40:43.733,00:40:46.903,So what are you doing here?
00:40:46.903,00:40:48.780,You want me to leave?
00:40:48.780,00:40:51.366,I just want to know what you're doing here.
00:40:51.366,00:40:55.828,"Well, like I said, Ann is my sister."
00:40:55.828,00:40:59.374,You can imagine the rest.
00:40:59.374,00:41:07.465,"No, I think it's probably better if I don't characterize that conversation that I didn't hear."
00:41:07.465,00:41:15.098,I don't have any idea really what you or Ann said about me or anything else.
00:41:17.558,00:41:19.102,Do you want some iced tea?
00:41:19.102,00:41:20.519,Sure.
00:41:20.519,00:41:23.022,I don't have any lemons.
00:41:23.022,00:41:30.322,"The last time I saw Ann, she left here very confused, I'd say, and upset."
00:41:30.322,00:41:32.282,She still is.
00:41:33.992,00:41:38.997,So are you here to make me feel bad for making her feel bad?
00:41:40.873,00:41:42.208,No.
00:41:46.129,00:41:48.381,She didn't tell you why she was upset?
00:41:48.381,00:41:50.258,No.
00:41:56.306,00:41:57.932,Thanks.
00:42:02.895,00:42:05.482,So I don't understand.
00:42:05.482,00:42:08.151,What made you wanna come here?
00:42:08.151,00:42:12.864,I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
00:42:12.864,00:42:17.410,"Yeah, well, see, I don't really listen to Ann when it comes to men."
00:42:17.410,00:42:21.580,"I mean, look at John, for Christ sake."
00:42:21.580,00:42:24.167,"But then you went to school with him, didn't you?"
00:42:24.167,00:42:27.128,You're probably friends or something.
00:42:27.128,00:42:28.463,No.
00:42:31.049,00:42:33.259,No. I think John is a liar.
00:42:36.471,00:42:40.141,I think you're right.
00:42:40.141,00:42:45.855,"So, come on. I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked."
00:42:45.855,00:42:47.815,Would you tell me what happened?
00:42:49.234,00:42:50.860,Spooked? The...
00:42:52.362,00:42:56.074,The videotapes are what got Ann so spooked.
00:43:13.925,00:43:15.552,I think I get it.
00:43:15.552,00:43:18.679,"Oh, yeah? What do you get?"
00:43:18.679,00:43:22.392,"If Ann got freaked out by these, they must be something sexual."
00:43:22.392,00:43:25.520,Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls?
00:43:25.520,00:43:27.146,"No, not exactly."
00:43:27.146,00:43:30.024,"Well, either you are or you aren't."
00:43:30.024,00:43:32.026,Why don't you let me tape you?
00:43:34.571,00:43:36.197,Doing what?
00:43:36.197,00:43:38.157,About what?
00:43:38.157,00:43:43.413,"About sex, your sexual history, sexual preferences."
00:43:46.249,00:43:48.376,What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
00:43:48.376,00:43:49.752,Nothing.
00:43:54.591,00:43:58.010,And you just wanna ask me questions?
00:43:58.010,00:43:59.596,I just wanna ask you questions.
00:43:59.596,00:44:01.806,That's all.
00:44:06.018,00:44:11.190,"Is this how you get off or something, taping women talking about their sexual experiences?"
00:44:11.190,00:44:12.775,Yes.
00:44:12.775,00:44:14.068,Would anyone else see the tape?
00:44:14.068,00:44:15.403,Absolutely not.
00:44:15.403,00:44:19.198,Nobody else sees the tapes except for me.
00:44:19.198,00:44:20.699,How long will it take?
00:44:22.910,00:44:28.374,"Well, that depends on you."
00:44:28.374,00:44:31.169,And another used three two-hour tapes.
00:44:34.005,00:44:36.257,How do we start?
00:44:36.257,00:44:39.051,"I turn on the camera, and you start talking."
00:44:41.429,00:44:43.598,Do I sit or stand?
00:44:43.598,00:44:45.224,Whatever you prefer.
00:44:45.224,00:44:47.018,I prefer to sit.
00:44:54.984,00:44:56.611,Are you ready?
00:45:03.868,00:45:07.788,"Okay, I'm recording."
00:45:07.788,00:45:11.167,Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
00:45:11.167,00:45:12.585,Speak in a normal voice.
00:45:12.585,00:45:14.128,Okay.
00:45:15.672,00:45:19.592,So describe for me your first sexual experience.
00:45:25.097,00:45:28.100,"My first sexual experience, or the first time I had intercourse?"
00:45:28.100,00:45:29.310,First sexual experience.
00:45:29.310,00:45:30.603,First sexual experience.
00:45:38.653,00:45:40.154,I was...
00:45:41.947,00:45:44.033,...eight.
00:45:44.033,00:45:47.328,And... Is this the kind of thing that...
00:45:47.328,00:45:48.829,"Yeah, okay."
00:45:49.997,00:45:59.882,"I was eight years old, and Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee."
00:45:59.882,00:46:04.053,"And I said he could if I could watch him take one, too."
00:46:04.053,00:46:14.480,"So, we went to the woods behind my house, and I got this feeling that he was chickening out, because he kept saying, Ladies first."
00:46:14.480,00:46:24.282,"So I pulled down my little panties and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished."
00:46:24.282,00:46:28.077,"So, was it a topic of conversation between the two of you after that?"
00:46:28.077,00:46:35.293,"No! He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away."
00:46:35.293,00:46:37.920,"To Cleveland, actually."
00:46:37.920,00:46:40.089,What a shame.
00:46:41.798,00:46:45.844,When did you finally see a penis?
00:46:45.844,00:46:47.972,When I was 14.
00:46:49.390,00:46:52.059,So what did you think?
00:46:52.059,00:46:56.272,Was it what you expected it to be?
00:47:00.526,00:47:04.071,No. Not really. I...
00:47:07.325,00:47:10.119,I didn't...
00:47:13.539,00:47:18.043,I didn't think it would have veins or ridges or anything.
00:47:18.043,00:47:21.673,"I just thought it would be smooth, like a test tube."
00:47:22.965,00:47:26.636,"It's weird, thinking about it now."
00:47:30.515,00:47:38.523,The organ itself seemed like a separate thing and a separate entity to me.
00:47:38.523,00:47:46.322,"I mean, when he finally pulled it out, and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it."
00:47:46.322,00:47:50.159,I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
00:47:50.159,00:47:52.286,What did he say?
00:47:52.286,00:47:54.664,He said my hand felt good.
00:47:58.334,00:48:00.461,Then what happened?
00:48:02.547,00:48:10.847,"And then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking."
00:48:32.993,00:48:35.246,JOHN: Yeah?
00:48:36.748,00:48:38.123,How'd you get through?
00:48:38.123,00:48:40.543,I told Janet I was Ann.
00:48:40.543,00:48:43.421,Ah. She bought it?
00:48:43.421,00:48:45.089,"Well, obviously."
00:48:45.089,00:48:49.761,"Look, I want to see you."
00:48:50.720,00:48:52.722,"Well, when?"
00:48:52.722,00:48:55.391,I don't know if I can do that.
00:48:55.391,00:48:59.228,I've already rescheduled him once.
00:48:59.228,00:49:01.272,I'll have to do some pretty heavy duty juggling.
00:49:01.272,00:49:04.901,"Then get those balls in the air, and get your butt over here."
00:49:24.503,00:49:25.671,"JANET: Yes, sir."
00:49:25.671,00:49:27.632,Janet.
00:49:27.632,00:49:31.051,"Listen, I want you to reschedule Kirkland."
00:49:31.051,00:49:34.263,See if he can come in Monday anytime.
00:49:34.263,00:49:37.934,Tell him... Tell him...
00:49:37.934,00:49:39.685,Family crisis.
00:49:39.685,00:49:41.061,Okay.
00:49:41.061,00:49:43.063,I'll slip out the back.
00:49:43.063,00:49:45.190,All right. Bye.
00:49:48.903,00:49:51.155,CYNTHIA: Would you like me to take my skirt off?
00:49:56.661,00:49:58.120,GRAHAM: If you wish.
00:50:19.308,00:50:21.978,You're not wearing any underwear.
00:50:27.566,00:50:29.568,Do you like the way I look?
00:50:31.278,00:50:32.655,Yes.
00:50:36.450,00:50:38.536,Do you think I'm pretty?
00:50:39.787,00:50:41.163,Yes.
00:50:45.960,00:50:48.004,Prettier than Ann?
00:50:49.129,00:50:50.798,Different.
00:50:55.761,00:50:59.223,John and Ann don't have sex anymore.
00:51:04.729,00:51:06.647,Is that what he tells you?
00:51:06.647,00:51:08.816,He doesn't have to tell me.
00:51:22.788,00:51:25.041,You're on fire today.
00:51:33.007,00:51:34.550,Yes.
00:51:37.762,00:51:39.805,You can go now.
00:51:43.183,00:51:46.062,CYNTHIA ON PHONE: He just asked me questions.
00:51:47.521,00:51:50.066,ANN: What kind of questions?
00:51:50.066,00:51:54.278,Questions about sex.
00:51:56.321,00:51:59.283,"Well, what did he ask exactly?"
00:51:59.283,00:52:03.161,"Well, I don't wanna tell you exactly."
00:52:04.830,00:52:09.835,"You let a total stranger record your sexual life on videotape, but you won't tell your own sister."
00:52:09.835,00:52:12.421,Apparently.
00:52:12.421,00:52:14.465,Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
00:52:17.009,00:52:20.220,Did he ask me to take my clothes off?
00:52:20.220,00:52:22.556,Did you take your clothes off?
00:52:22.556,00:52:25.059,Cynthia!
00:52:25.059,00:52:27.227,Why did you do that?
00:52:27.227,00:52:28.437,But why did you want to?
00:52:28.437,00:52:30.731,Because I wanted him to see me.
00:52:30.731,00:52:32.232,You're crazy.
00:52:32.232,00:52:34.068,He could be bouncing that off some satellite.
00:52:34.068,00:52:36.904,Some horny old men in South America could be watching you.
00:52:36.904,00:52:38.864,Ann! He wouldn't do that.
00:52:38.864,00:52:40.365,You don't know that for sure.
00:52:40.365,00:52:44.453,"Well, it's too late now, isn't it?"
00:52:44.453,00:52:47.205,Did he touch you?
00:52:47.205,00:52:48.415,No.
00:52:49.667,00:52:51.585,Did you touch him?
00:52:51.585,00:52:53.004,No.
00:52:57.091,00:52:59.259,Did anybody touch anybody?
00:53:01.053,00:53:03.472,"Well, yes."
00:53:05.474,00:53:08.184,Don't tell me.
00:53:08.184,00:53:09.770,Don't tell me!
00:53:09.770,00:53:11.772,Don't tell me! You didn't!
00:53:11.772,00:53:13.357,I did.
00:53:13.357,00:53:15.567,I did. I did!
00:53:15.567,00:53:18.529,"Oh, my God! Cynthia!"
00:53:20.948,00:53:22.491,You're in trouble.
00:53:23.617,00:53:26.162,Listen to you.
00:53:26.162,00:53:28.164,What are you talking about?
00:53:29.373,00:53:31.625,"God, Cynthia!"
00:53:31.625,00:53:33.752,I couldn't even do that in front of John.
00:53:33.752,00:53:35.504,"You couldn't even do it, period."
00:53:35.504,00:53:38.007,You know what I mean.
00:53:38.007,00:53:40.009,I feel like I do.
00:53:40.009,00:53:42.011,You can't possibly trust him.
00:53:42.011,00:53:45.097,"Look, Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much."
00:53:45.097,00:53:49.393,You didn't do it. I did.
00:53:50.769,00:53:51.896,I don't wanna talk about it.
00:53:51.896,00:53:53.689,"Okay, then don't!"
00:54:13.333,00:54:16.003,Are you an assassin?
00:54:16.003,00:54:18.089,Excuse me?
00:54:18.089,00:54:23.761,"You're just an errand boy, sent by the grocer to collect the bill."
00:54:28.891,00:54:31.267,It's my Brando.
00:54:31.267,00:54:32.686,Marlon Brando?
00:54:32.686,00:54:34.980,It's great. Pardon me.
00:54:34.980,00:54:38.358,Okay. Yeah.
00:54:38.358,00:54:41.070,Maybe you should be there for a while.
00:54:41.070,00:54:45.699,Hi. So why don't you get an answering machine?
00:54:45.699,00:54:47.325,There's a phone here.
00:54:47.325,00:54:49.078,It's busy.
00:54:49.078,00:54:51.997,Why don't you keep trying?
00:54:51.997,00:54:53.999,Okay.
00:54:57.253,00:54:58.879,"Well, here it is."
00:54:58.879,00:55:00.214,What is it?
00:55:00.214,00:55:03.299,It's a sundress.
00:55:03.299,00:55:05.261,It does not.
00:55:05.261,00:55:09.305,"Why would she want a sundress? I mean, she's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins."
00:55:09.305,00:55:11.683,"Well, Missy Thing, so will you someday."
00:55:11.683,00:55:14.061,"Yeah. When I do, I won't be wearing sundresses."
00:55:16.147,00:55:18.274,"God, Cynthia..."
00:55:31.287,00:55:32.288,Bayou.
00:55:32.288,00:55:33.622,Cynthia. John.
00:55:33.622,00:55:34.915,"Well, this is timely."
00:55:34.915,00:55:36.041,Would you like to speak with her?
00:55:36.041,00:55:38.334,What's she doing there?
00:55:38.334,00:55:41.379,She came by to show me a present that she and I are buying for your mother-in-law.
00:55:41.379,00:55:43.007,Oh.
00:55:43.007,00:55:45.425,"So, when can I see you?"
00:55:45.425,00:55:47.261,I don't know.
00:55:47.261,00:55:50.430,I'm not sure I can duplicate the intensity I had the other day.
00:55:50.430,00:55:52.808,Nothing wrong with trying.
00:55:52.808,00:55:56.478,I don't think my sister would agree.
00:55:56.478,00:55:58.856,Do you want me to stop calling?
00:55:58.856,00:56:00.858,"Look, I'll call you, okay?"
00:56:00.858,00:56:02.193,Roger.
00:56:05.112,00:56:06.947,Hi. This is too much.
00:56:06.947,00:56:08.824,I'm wearing red.
00:56:08.824,00:56:10.575,"That's quite a coincidence, wouldn't you say?"
00:56:10.575,00:56:12.203,"Look, I'm married."
00:56:12.203,00:56:13.537,Really?
00:56:13.537,00:56:15.747,Are you very married?
00:56:15.747,00:56:16.874,Married enough.
00:56:16.874,00:56:18.542,"Oh, oh."
00:56:18.542,00:56:20.669,"I see. Well, that shouldn't stop us."
00:56:20.669,00:56:22.587,"I'm just here to see my sister, okay?"
00:56:22.587,00:56:25.799,"Oh, really?"
00:56:27.092,00:56:30.637,"So, what's my share on the dress?"
00:56:30.637,00:56:32.097,$32.50.
00:56:32.097,00:56:33.849,It's a nice dress.
00:56:33.849,00:56:36.560,"I thought so, too."
00:56:33.849,00:56:38.645,"Looks like a tablecloth, but it's very nice."
00:56:36.560,00:56:41.273,"Keep the change. And, Ann, don't worry about the dress."
00:56:42.900,00:56:46.570,Yeah. I think...
00:56:46.570,00:56:49.781,I'll see you later.
00:56:49.781,00:56:51.575,Bye.
00:57:15.182,00:57:16.725,John?
00:57:17.642,00:57:18.977,Mm-hmm.
00:57:21.355,00:57:23.190,John?
00:57:25.192,00:57:31.531,"I called you last Monday at 3:30, and they said you weren't in."
00:57:31.531,00:57:33.784,Do you remember where you were?
00:57:35.327,00:57:36.954,On Monday?
00:57:39.206,00:57:41.292,Last Monday.
00:57:41.292,00:57:43.585,I had a late lunch.
00:57:45.503,00:57:47.839,So who did you have lunch with?
00:57:52.386,00:57:54.305,I ate by myself.
00:57:56.348,00:57:57.933,Come on.
00:58:05.565,00:58:07.443,Is there something wrong?
00:58:07.443,00:58:10.362,Are you having an affair?
00:58:13.698,00:58:15.784,Jesus Christ!
00:58:17.702,00:58:21.957,"I have a late lunch by myself, and now I'm fucking somebody?"
00:58:21.957,00:58:25.252,"Well, are you?"
00:58:25.252,00:58:28.797,"God, I'm offended at the accusation."
00:58:31.758,00:58:34.594,"If I'm right, I wanna know."
00:58:34.594,00:58:39.266,I don't want you to lie.
00:58:41.393,00:58:44.146,"Well, there's nothing to know."
00:58:46.564,00:58:49.776,I can't tell you how upset I'll be if you lie to me.
00:58:55.740,00:58:57.493,Is this paranoia?
00:59:00.454,00:59:05.000,"I mean, if anybody should be paranoid, I should be."
00:59:06.960,00:59:11.215,"Every time I try to touch you, you act as if I'm dipped in shit."
00:59:13.467,00:59:25.437,"I think there are a lot of women out there that would be glad to have a young, straight male, making a pretty good living, beside them in bed with a hard-on."
00:59:25.437,00:59:28.065,"My sister, for one."
00:59:28.065,00:59:31.776,Is that who it is?
00:59:31.776,00:59:34.446,"I don't find her that attractive, for one thing."
00:59:34.446,00:59:37.657,Is that supposed to comfort me?
00:59:37.657,00:59:42.746,I'm just saying I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love to me.
00:59:42.746,00:59:49.002,"I mean, I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair."
00:59:49.002,00:59:50.254,I'm not.
00:59:50.254,00:59:52.214,"Well, I'm not either."
00:59:52.214,00:59:53.798,Then why don't I believe you?
00:59:53.798,00:59:56.134,"Look, this is ridiculous."
00:59:56.134,00:59:58.136,Maybe when you have some evidence...
00:59:58.136,01:00:00.597,Evidence? There's evidence?
01:00:00.597,01:00:04.476,I'm just saying that we shouldn't not ever talk.
01:00:04.476,01:00:07.438,Just don't give me conjecture and intuition.
01:00:07.438,01:00:10.648,Always a lawyer.
01:00:10.648,01:00:14.319,"I mean, can you imagine?"
01:00:14.319,01:00:15.737,I can't place him at the scene...
01:00:15.737,01:00:17.739,All right.
01:00:17.739,01:00:19.116,...but I have this strong feeling.
01:00:19.116,01:00:20.951,All right. You made your point. Okay.
01:00:20.951,01:00:22.578,All right.
01:00:29.667,01:00:32.546,I'm sorry.
01:00:32.546,01:00:38.176,I'm just under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing.
01:00:38.176,01:00:41.472,"You know, it's my first big case as junior partner."
01:00:43.599,01:00:48.937,"I work all day, and I come home, and I look forward to seeing you."
01:00:51.523,01:00:58.363,And it--it hurts that you'd accuse me like that.
01:00:58.363,01:00:59.906,I'm sorry.
01:01:01.992,01:01:04.995,What? Come on.
01:01:06.871,01:01:16.923,"I've just got all this time on my hands, and I just sit around and start inventing these, like, intricate scenarios."
01:01:16.923,01:01:21.386,"And then I don't want to have wasted all my time, so I want to believe them."
01:01:25.557,01:01:27.351,Isn't therapy helping at all?
01:01:27.351,01:01:29.645,"Oh, John, I don't know."
01:01:29.645,01:01:36.360,I just feel so stupid sitting there talking about my little problems when I know those poor children are starving.
01:01:36.360,01:01:37.986,Well...
01:01:41.698,01:01:48.955,Quitting your therapy is not going to feed the children in Ethiopia.
01:01:48.955,01:01:50.999,I know.
01:01:55.712,01:01:58.423,You never used to say the word fucking.
01:02:01.343,01:02:03.053,Fuck!
01:02:05.763,01:02:09.267,"It's so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it."
01:02:09.267,01:02:11.436,What's so stupid about it?
01:02:13.689,01:02:15.649,You don't even know the guy.
01:02:15.649,01:02:18.943,"Well, you know him."
01:02:18.943,01:02:21.697,Do you think he can be trusted?
01:02:21.697,01:02:23.532,I don't know.
01:02:25.325,01:02:29.413,"I don't know. From what you've told me, I don't know."
01:02:29.413,01:02:35.043,I should have known when he showed up dressed like some undertaker for the art world.
01:02:35.043,01:02:37.713,I like the way he dresses.
01:02:46.804,01:02:49.224,What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
01:02:50.267,01:02:52.310,The wrong hands?
01:02:52.310,01:02:55.522,"John, we are not talking about military secrets here."
01:02:55.522,01:03:01.319,They're just tapes he makes so he could sit around and get off.
01:03:03.113,01:03:06.700,And he doesn't have sex with any of them?
01:03:06.700,01:03:09.244,They just sit around and talk.
01:03:11.705,01:03:17.168,I could almost understand it if he had sex with them.
01:03:17.168,01:03:21.923,Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or some porno movies or something?
01:03:21.923,01:03:23.883,It doesn't work.
01:03:23.883,01:03:26.511,He has to know the people.
01:03:26.511,01:03:27.845,Interact?
01:03:28.764,01:03:32.267,Whatever that means.
01:03:32.267,01:03:34.728,Did you have to masturbate in front of him?
01:03:34.728,01:03:38.815,I felt like it. Goddamn!
01:03:38.815,01:03:40.858,You told Ann about this?
01:03:40.858,01:03:43.069,I do tell her almost everything.
01:03:43.069,01:03:45.322,Why not?
01:03:45.322,01:03:48.074,It's just something I'd prefer she didn't have to know about.
01:03:48.074,01:03:50.577,She's a grown-up.
01:03:50.577,01:03:51.911,Ann...
01:03:53.371,01:03:54.748,Ann is just very...
01:03:54.748,01:03:57.501,Hung-up!
01:03:57.501,01:03:59.336,It just wasn't a smart thing to do.
01:03:59.336,01:04:01.254,"Oh, God!"
01:04:03.799,01:04:06.718,"Did you sign any sort of paper, or..."
01:04:06.718,01:04:11.389,Did he have a contract with you saying that he wouldn't broadcast these things?
01:04:11.389,01:04:13.391,"No, sir."
01:04:13.391,01:04:15.977,You realize you have no recourse legally.
01:04:17.979,01:04:22.442,It's not funny.
01:04:22.442,01:04:25.028,Those tapes could show up anywhere.
01:04:25.028,01:04:28.657,They won't. I trust him.
01:04:28.657,01:04:31.075,You trust him.
01:04:31.075,01:04:35.913,"Yeah, I do, a hell of a lot more than I trust you."
01:04:38.124,01:04:39.584,What do you mean?
01:04:39.584,01:04:41.127,Just what I said.
01:04:41.127,01:04:43.880,I'd trust him before I'd trust you.
01:04:45.757,01:04:47.759,"God, it hurts that you'd say that to me."
01:04:47.759,01:04:50.470,"Come on, John!"
01:04:50.470,01:04:52.472,"You're a liar, but at least I know you're a liar."
01:04:52.472,01:04:56.100,I know. I know.
01:04:52.472,01:04:57.728,"Second-lowest form of human being, and the first."
01:04:57.728,01:04:59.312,What are you talking about?
01:04:59.312,01:05:01.898,"By definition, you're lying to Ann, too."
01:05:01.898,01:05:08.780,"Yeah, right, but I didn't take a vow in front of God and everyone to be faithful to Ann."
01:05:15.036,01:05:18.289,"Look, are we gonna do it or not?"
01:05:18.289,01:05:21.334,"Actually, no."
01:05:21.334,01:05:25.296,I've changed my mind.
01:05:25.296,01:05:27.716,I'm here now.
01:05:27.716,01:05:30.552,to do something.
01:05:30.552,01:05:32.970,Would you like to help me straighten up?
01:05:35.056,01:05:40.520,Jesus! Is there one chair in this place that works?
01:05:40.520,01:05:44.900,"Well, why don't you go sit somewhere else?"
01:05:44.900,01:05:46.943,"Come on, John."
01:05:46.943,01:05:50.321,You should be happy.
01:05:50.321,01:05:54.075,I'm making it real easy on you.
01:05:54.075,01:05:56.035,Did he put you up to this?
01:05:56.035,01:05:57.245,Graham.
01:05:57.245,01:05:59.956,"No, he didn't put me up to this."
01:05:59.956,01:06:03.460,"Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what to do. I've just been thinking, that's all."
01:06:03.460,01:06:05.336,"Now, just leave."
01:06:06.671,01:06:09.674,"Well, maybe I don't want to leave."
01:06:09.674,01:06:12.260,Maybe I want to talk.
01:06:12.260,01:06:15.847,"John, we don't have anything to talk about."
01:06:18.057,01:06:19.684,"Yeah, you're right."
01:06:21.770,01:06:23.897,Things are getting complicated.
01:06:25.064,01:06:28.652,"No, they're getting real simple."
01:09:04.057,01:09:05.725,It's open.
01:09:14.317,01:09:15.777,Hello.
01:09:20.448,01:09:22.158,Want something to drink?
01:09:24.869,01:09:26.537,Yeah. Thanks.
01:09:34.671,01:09:37.132,Sorry. I don't have any iced tea left.
01:09:41.260,01:09:42.720,Thank you.
01:09:49.226,01:09:53.815,John and Cynthia have been fucking.
01:09:55.859,01:09:57.610,"Yes, I know."
01:09:58.903,01:10:00.655,You know?
01:10:00.655,01:10:01.990,Yes.
01:10:03.533,01:10:05.576,How did you know?
01:10:09.122,01:10:11.541,She said it on her tape.
01:10:11.541,01:10:14.752,Thanks for telling me.
01:10:14.752,01:10:17.421,"Well, I haven't seen you."
01:10:17.421,01:10:22.218,I don't think I would have told you even if I had seen you.
01:10:22.218,01:10:23.845,Why not?
01:10:26.014,01:10:29.517,Because it's not really my place.
01:10:37.067,01:10:38.860,My life is shit.
01:10:40.570,01:10:42.446,It's just shit.
01:10:44.699,01:10:48.452,Nothing is what I thought it was.
01:10:55.292,01:10:58.295,John's a bastard.
01:11:04.802,01:11:07.430,Let's make a videotape.
01:11:10.016,01:11:13.144,"No, I..."
01:11:13.144,01:11:15.855,I don't think that's a good idea.
01:11:15.855,01:11:18.357,Why not?
01:11:18.357,01:11:22.904,Because I don't think it's a choice that you'd make in a normal frame of mind.
01:11:22.904,01:11:26.616,And what would you know about a normal frame of mind?
01:11:30.120,01:11:31.955,That's a good question.
01:11:35.625,01:11:38.044,So what do you have to do to get ready?
01:11:42.799,01:11:45.843,Load a tape and turn on the camera.
01:11:48.012,01:11:50.556,Do it.
01:11:58.689,01:12:09.242,"So, where do you get your money from for rent and tapes, stuff like that?"
01:12:09.242,01:12:11.368,Underneath my mattress.
01:12:13.163,01:12:16.166,And what are you gonna do when this money runs out?
01:12:16.166,01:12:17.959,It won't.
01:12:19.669,01:12:21.963,Are you comfortable there?
01:12:23.464,01:12:25.466,"Yeah, I'm comfortable."
01:12:29.304,01:12:33.308,"Okay, I'm recording."
01:12:36.769,01:12:38.980,Ann Bishop Mullany.
01:13:11.179,01:13:12.722,"Margaret. Hi, it's John."
01:13:12.722,01:13:15.683,"Fine. Fine. Listen, have you seen Ann at all today?"
01:13:15.683,01:13:18.435,This afternoon?
01:13:18.435,01:13:22.273,"Well, no, I just..."
01:13:22.273,01:13:25.193,Bye-bye. Everything's fine.
01:13:25.193,01:13:27.528,Ah! Thank God.
01:13:27.528,01:13:30.281,"I come home, the door is open, the car is gone."
01:13:32.116,01:13:35.370,I thought you'd been abducted by some mad fucker.
01:13:37.454,01:13:38.956,"Honey, you all right?"
01:13:38.956,01:13:41.667,I want out of this marriage.
01:13:46.797,01:13:48.132,What?
01:13:50.634,01:13:55.806,I want out of this marriage.
01:14:01.854,01:14:03.856,Why?
01:14:03.856,01:14:05.482,Why?
01:14:08.194,01:14:12.823,You're asking me why?
01:14:12.823,01:14:16.035,"Well, I'm married to you."
01:14:16.035,01:14:17.787,I think you could tell me that.
01:14:19.747,01:14:22.250,Fuck you.
01:14:22.250,01:14:24.335,Fuck you.
01:14:28.965,01:14:30.425,All right.
01:14:33.886,01:14:36.097,Can you tell me where you went?
01:14:36.097,01:14:39.725,I drove around.
01:14:39.725,01:14:41.018,Graham's?
01:14:41.018,01:14:42.937,Graham.
01:14:48.567,01:14:51.279,"Oh, God damn it!"
01:14:51.279,01:14:54.573,The backstabbing son of a...
01:14:54.573,01:14:56.367,Mr. Apostle of Truth!
01:15:08.254,01:15:11.799,"Well, I know you didn't fuck him."
01:15:21.767,01:15:25.438,Did you make one of these goddamn videotapes?
01:15:30.318,01:15:32.236,Annie...
01:15:32.236,01:15:35.990,"Answer me, God damn it."
01:15:38.075,01:15:39.369,"Yes, I did."
01:15:41.954,01:15:43.873,God!
01:15:43.873,01:15:45.958,Don't you touch him!
01:16:01.224,01:16:05.186,Okay. Okay. Cool down.
01:16:07.855,01:16:09.106,What?
01:16:10.358,01:16:13.528,Hello?
01:16:13.528,01:16:17.990,"John, what are you..."
01:16:21.035,01:16:22.453,Damn.
01:17:02.659,01:17:04.828,"GRAHAM: Okay, I'm recording."
01:17:07.290,01:17:09.584,Tell me your name.
01:17:11.168,01:17:15.256,Ann Bishop Mullany.
01:17:15.256,01:17:18.342,So what do you want to talk about?
01:17:18.342,01:17:19.927,What do you usually talk about on these tapes?
01:17:19.927,01:17:21.929,Sex.
01:17:21.929,01:17:24.599,Okay. Let's talk about sex.
01:17:25.849,01:17:28.311,Do you have sex?
01:17:28.311,01:17:30.980,Not very often. No.
01:17:32.273,01:17:35.568,"When you do, who usually initiates it?"
01:17:35.568,01:17:37.153,He does.
01:17:39.780,01:17:42.283,Is the sex satisfying?
01:17:47.330,01:17:50.124,I don't know.
01:17:50.124,01:17:52.709,I don't know.
01:17:54.587,01:17:56.713,Do you have orgasms?
01:17:56.713,01:17:59.883,I don't think so.
01:17:59.883,01:18:04.888,"I mean, I guess since I'm not sure that I've never had one, I..."
01:18:24.783,01:18:28.245,Have you ever thought about having sex with someone other than your husband?
01:18:30.747,01:18:32.416,Here we go.
01:18:34.043,01:18:35.670,Here we go.
01:18:43.052,01:18:45.888,Why don't we stop?
01:18:45.888,01:18:47.557,I don't wanna stop.
01:18:56.357,01:19:01.362,Have you ever thought about having sex with someone other than your husband?
01:19:01.362,01:19:03.947,I've thought about it.
01:19:03.947,01:19:06.617,GRAHAM: Did you act on it?
01:19:06.617,01:19:08.827,ANN: No.
01:19:08.827,01:19:10.371,Why not?
01:19:11.914,01:19:14.124,Because that's how Cynthia thinks.
01:19:14.124,01:19:18.003,I hate it when I have feelings that she has.
01:19:20.256,01:19:25.052,"It bothers me when I think about men, because I know that's the way she thinks."
01:19:29.306,01:19:31.559,What other men have you thought about?
01:19:35.979,01:19:38.524,I thought about you.
01:19:40.484,01:19:42.653,Have you thought about me?
01:19:42.653,01:19:44.071,Yes.
01:19:49.326,01:19:51.621,What did you think?
01:19:53.330,01:19:56.959,I thought about what you would look like having an orgasm.
01:20:05.134,01:20:08.471,I'd like to know what I look like having an orgasm.
01:20:14.310,01:20:17.813,"Can you do that, give a woman an orgasm?"
01:20:22.067,01:20:23.569,Yes.
01:20:23.569,01:20:26.280,Could you do that for me?
01:20:30.159,01:20:31.452,No.
01:20:32.869,01:20:34.497,Why not?
01:20:34.497,01:20:37.249,Because I can't.
01:20:37.249,01:20:38.584,Can't or won't?
01:20:38.584,01:20:41.420,I can't because I won't.
01:20:49.804,01:20:53.349,You said you weren't always impotent.
01:20:53.349,01:20:55.518,"No. Yeah, that's correct."
01:20:56.811,01:20:58.729,So you have had sex?
01:20:58.729,01:21:00.314,Yes.
01:21:02.441,01:21:04.610,"So, what happened?"
01:21:04.610,01:21:07.822,"Was it so bad it turned you off, or..."
01:21:10.449,01:21:11.826,"No, that wasn't my problem."
01:21:11.826,01:21:13.786,What was the problem?
01:21:13.786,01:21:16.789,I was the problem.
01:21:19.500,01:21:22.545,I was a pathological liar.
01:21:22.545,01:21:25.339,"Or I am, I should say."
01:21:25.339,01:21:27.758,Lying is...
01:21:29.926,01:21:35.307,Lying is like alcoholism.
01:21:35.307,01:21:36.975,So that's it?
01:21:38.101,01:21:39.729,You lied?
01:21:42.231,01:21:43.858,That was part of it.
01:21:43.858,01:21:46.193,So what else happened?
01:21:47.653,01:21:51.574,"Well, at that time, I..."
01:21:56.119,01:22:12.010,I used to express my feelings nonverbally and often scared people who were close to me.
01:22:12.010,01:22:14.304,Are you still like that?
01:22:16.223,01:22:17.558,No.
01:22:19.351,01:22:20.686,No.
01:22:26.275,01:22:28.819,So you're never gonna make love again.
01:22:28.819,01:22:32.239,I haven't made any plans.
01:22:38.203,01:22:40.790,"If you were in love with me, would you?"
01:22:40.790,01:22:42.958,I'm not in love with you.
01:22:42.958,01:22:44.293,I can't answer that.
01:22:44.293,01:22:46.503,Why not?
01:22:46.503,01:22:48.964,I don't understand.
01:22:48.964,01:22:51.967,"Forget about the sex, you know."
01:22:54.094,01:22:57.514,"I'm not the same person that I was, even remotely."
01:22:57.514,01:23:05.564,"You know, I'm different in so many ways that have a profound effect on the way that I relate to other people, the way I communicate."
01:23:05.564,01:23:07.733,"I mean, this, for instance."
01:23:07.733,01:23:10.986,"I mean, the way she and I are talking, that could never have been possible."
01:23:10.986,01:23:14.531,She? The way she and I are talking?
01:23:14.531,01:23:16.700,She? Who's she?
01:23:16.700,01:23:18.786,"I'm sorry, I was..."
01:23:18.786,01:23:20.913,I was... That isn't what I was doing.
01:23:20.913,01:23:24.207,She's Elizabeth?
01:23:24.207,01:23:28.128,Is that the girl that John talked about?
01:23:34.259,01:23:37.137,I guess. I guess.
01:23:37.137,01:23:41.600,"So you're still in contact with her, then."
01:23:41.600,01:23:43.602,With Elizabeth?
01:23:43.602,01:23:48.231,So what do you think Elizabeth is gonna think about all these videotapes?
01:23:50.526,01:23:55.155,I can't imagine her being too understanding.
01:23:55.155,01:24:00.202,"But you're gonna tell her about them, right?"
01:24:00.202,01:24:02.496,"As I said, I don't..."
01:24:04.915,01:24:07.292,know what I'm gonna do exactly. I mean...
01:24:07.292,01:24:11.171,Perhaps I won't do anything. I don't...
01:24:11.171,01:24:15.009,So you just came back here so that you could think about it.
01:24:15.009,01:24:18.428,No. I moved back here for some...
01:24:22.057,01:24:25.101,"A sense of closure, you know?"
01:24:29.105,01:24:31.274,A resolution of some sort.
01:24:37.155,01:24:45.915,"I wanted somebody who is very important to me to understand that, I guess."
01:24:45.915,01:24:47.541,That's...
01:24:48.876,01:24:50.252,That's pathetic.
01:24:53.589,01:24:57.384,"I mean, you can't just..."
01:24:57.384,01:25:03.557,"You just can't walk up to her and show her you've changed, like it's some gift or something."
01:25:07.185,01:25:09.646,And look what you've changed into.
01:25:11.356,01:25:12.942,Nine years.
01:25:12.942,01:25:17.947,"Nine years, and this is what you come up with."
01:25:17.947,01:25:21.617,Is this what you wanna be the rest of your life?
01:25:24.494,01:25:26.413,Why are you doing this?
01:25:28.206,01:25:32.753,Can you tell me that?
01:25:35.839,01:25:37.007,You gonna answer me?
01:25:37.007,01:25:38.383,"No, please, don't do that."
01:25:38.383,01:25:39.927,Why not?
01:25:39.927,01:25:41.678,Why not?
01:25:41.678,01:25:44.180,"Like why do you tape women talking about sex, huh?"
01:25:44.180,01:25:45.682,Why do you do that?
01:25:45.682,01:25:48.310,I can't tell you like this.
01:25:48.310,01:25:50.980,Come on. I'm just gonna keep asking.
01:25:50.980,01:25:53.732,"Ann, I just don't find the turning-the-tables thing very interesting."
01:25:53.732,01:25:56.693,"Well, I do."
01:25:56.693,01:25:57.987,Why?
01:25:57.987,01:26:00.739,What? What do you want me to tell you?
01:26:00.739,01:26:02.992,Tell me why? Why?
01:26:04.868,01:26:06.411,"Ann, you don't even know who I am."
01:26:06.411,01:26:08.705,You don't have the slightest idea who I am.
01:26:13.877,01:26:21.593,"Am I supposed to recount all the points in my life leading up to this moment, and then just hope that it's coherent, that it makes some sort of sense to you?"
01:26:21.593,01:26:23.679,It doesn't make any sense to me.
01:26:23.679,01:26:25.347,I was there.
01:26:25.347,01:26:32.354,"I don't have the slightest idea who I am, and I'm supposed to be able to explain it to you."
01:26:32.354,01:26:35.357,And why? You tell me why.
01:26:35.357,01:26:38.443,Why do I have to explain myself to you?
01:26:38.443,01:26:41.697,Because maybe I can help you.
01:26:41.697,01:26:43.573,Help me with what?
01:26:43.573,01:26:46.035,Your problem.
01:26:46.035,01:26:49.163,My problem?
01:26:49.163,01:26:55.044,"I look around me in this town and I see John and Cynthia and you, and I..."
01:26:56.503,01:26:59.255,I feel comparatively healthy.
01:27:03.343,01:27:05.470,You've got a problem.
01:27:09.599,01:27:11.393,You're right.
01:27:18.400,01:27:20.276,I've got a lot of problems.
01:27:28.702,01:27:30.746,And they belong to me.
01:27:33.331,01:27:37.711,"You think they're yours, but they're not."
01:27:37.711,01:27:42.132,Everybody that walks in that door becomes part of your problem.
01:27:42.132,01:27:44.551,Anybody that comes in contact with you.
01:27:48.097,01:27:51.183,"I didn't want to be part of your problem, but I am."
01:27:52.642,01:27:54.770,I'm leaving my husband.
01:27:54.770,01:27:59.066,"And maybe I would have anyway, but the fact is I'm doing it now."
01:28:01.693,01:28:05.197,And part of it is because of you.
01:28:09.367,01:28:12.788,You've had an effect on my life.
01:28:17.834,01:28:20.670,This isn't supposed to happen.
01:28:24.591,01:28:30.806,I've spent nine years structuring my life so that this didn't happen.
01:32:26.333,01:32:30.586,"You know, I never told you this 'cause I knew it would crush you."
01:32:33.298,01:32:34.966,But now...
01:32:36.176,01:32:43.517,"I fucked Elizabeth before you broke up, before you were having trouble, even."
01:32:45.601,01:32:49.189,She's no saint.
01:32:50.648,01:32:52.775,She could keep a secret.
01:32:54.944,01:32:57.197,That's about all I can say about her.
01:33:54.170,01:33:56.923,JOHN: I gotta make a call.
01:34:00.135,01:34:01.595,RECEPTIONIST: Brian Kirkland's office.
01:34:01.595,01:34:03.679,"Yeah, John Mullany for Brian Kirkland."
01:34:03.679,01:34:04.764,"Just one moment, please."
01:34:04.764,01:34:06.224,All right.
01:34:06.224,01:34:09.894,"Anyway, as I've always said, work is critical."
01:34:09.894,01:34:13.856,"I can be happy without a marriage, but if you take away my work..."
01:34:13.856,01:34:19.488,"I mean, that's different."
01:34:13.856,01:34:23.533,"And if Ann can't handle that, well, that's her problem."
01:34:23.533,01:34:26.369,JANET ON SPEAKER PHONE: Mr. Mullany.
01:34:26.369,01:34:28.037,Mr. DeForest would like to see you in his office.
01:34:28.037,01:34:30.373,All right. In a minute.
01:34:30.373,01:34:32.125,He said immediately.
01:34:32.125,01:34:34.668,All right. Jesus.
01:34:34.668,01:34:36.212,RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Mullany.
01:34:36.212,01:34:41.092,Mr. Kirkland has asked me to inform you that he's obtained legal representation elsewhere.
01:34:41.092,01:34:44.179,"And that if you have a message for Mr. Kirkland, you could leave it with me."
01:34:44.179,01:34:45.888,Thank you.
01:34:48.266,01:34:49.392,No message.
01:34:49.392,01:34:50.519,"All right, Mr. Mullany."
01:34:50.519,01:34:52.686,Thank you.
01:34:52.686,01:34:54.648,Fool. Well...
01:34:55.773,01:34:57.984,Hope he knows what he's doing.
01:34:57.984,01:34:59.819,JANET: Mr. Mullany.
01:34:59.819,01:35:01.321,Mr. DeForest is waiting.
01:35:01.321,01:35:04.366,"All right. Tell him I'll be in, in a minute."
01:35:04.366,01:35:09.204,Jesus. The old man thinks that the world revolves around a game of golf.
01:35:09.204,01:35:11.914,"Listen, why don't I catch up to you at the courts in a few minutes?"
01:35:11.914,01:35:14.376,I'd better go talk to DeForest.
01:35:14.376,01:35:16.628,Okay.
01:35:24.052,01:35:25.679,Fuck.
01:35:45.073,01:35:47.701,"Oh, no, just one's fine."
01:35:50.744,01:35:52.997,This is my favorite part.
01:35:58.086,01:35:59.713,You know what I was thinking?
01:35:59.713,01:36:01.715,I was thinking we should name our first child Rusty.
01:36:01.715,01:36:04.384,What do you think of that name?
01:36:07.679,01:36:09.805,Okay.
01:36:09.805,01:36:13.476,"You know, I spend a lot of money in here. I should at least know your name."
01:36:13.476,01:36:15.853,ANN: Hey.
01:36:15.853,01:36:20.024,I brought you this.
01:36:20.024,01:36:22.444,Thanks.
01:36:22.444,01:36:24.237,MAN: It's a nice plant.
01:36:30.201,01:36:34.122,"Look, I can't stay."
01:36:34.122,01:36:36.332,Can I call you?
01:36:36.332,01:36:37.791,Do you have my work number?
01:36:37.791,01:36:39.127,No.
01:36:40.754,01:36:42.213,Got a pen?
01:36:46.968,01:36:49.763,"Okay, now, you're wearing blue, I'm wearing blue."
01:36:49.763,01:36:52.557,Is this some sort of weird coincidence?
01:36:52.557,01:36:56.060,I don't think so.
01:36:56.060,01:36:57.353,Do you live here?
01:36:57.353,01:36:59.773,No. Just passing through.
01:37:02.776,01:37:07.614,"Look, don't call between 3:00 and 5:00, 'cause I get real busy. Okay?"
01:37:07.614,01:37:08.782,Okay.
01:37:10.408,01:37:12.118,See you.
01:37:12.118,01:37:13.995,Bye.
01:37:13.995,01:37:15.455,"MAN: Okay, bye."
01:37:17.791,01:37:20.585,I like her.
01:37:20.585,01:37:22.211,Very nice.
01:37:33.889,01:37:36.100,Hey.
01:37:43.399,01:37:45.193,I think it's gonna rain.
01:37:50.072,01:37:52.908,It is raining.
01:37:52.908,01:37:55.119,Yeah.
