00:01:22.874,00:01:25.043,"Ten hours for me. It's, like, across the world."
00:01:25.251,00:01:26.878,I came here for this audition.
00:01:27.128,00:01:30.548,I told all my boys at home I'm coming to funk in front of Michael onstage.
00:01:30.757,00:01:32.133,I'm just gonna dance for him.
00:01:32.300,00:01:34.093,"I don't care if I make it, I don't care about nothing."
00:01:34.385,00:01:36.054,"Thank you, Michael. I'm excited."
00:01:36.262,00:01:40.391,You've inspired everything in my life. My energy.
00:01:40.600,00:01:41.893,You're why I dance.
00:01:42.101,00:01:43.228,I can remember being a little girl...
00:01:43.394,00:01:45.271,...and watching Thriller on TV with my mom...
00:01:45.438,00:01:48.024,...and thinking that that was the coolest thing in the world.
00:01:48.233,00:01:51.694,"I go to sleep and just wake up, and the first thing I do is not even eat."
00:01:51.903,00:01:53.613,I just start playing your music...
00:01:53.780,00:01:56.825,...and start just dancing and moonwalking on a rug.
00:01:57.033,00:02:00.453,"I was like, What I would give to be onstage with you."
00:02:00.662,00:02:04.666,"And the fact that I get to do that is-- It's amazing, so...."
00:02:05.333,00:02:07.794,I'm from Australia....
00:02:11.464,00:02:15.802,"And, um, I got word of your audition two days before it was about to happen..."
00:02:16.010,00:02:18.805,...and I was on the next flight over.
00:02:19.097,00:02:23.143,It begins. This is-- This is the beginning. I'm not even onstage yet.
00:02:23.351,00:02:24.936,"Like, I can't even imagine..."
00:02:25.103,00:02:28.273,...what's gonna happen backstage that first show in London.
00:02:28.481,00:02:29.858,I'm looking even farther ahead.
00:02:30.024,00:02:32.944,I don't even know what I wanna do after this because this is Michael.
00:02:33.111,00:02:34.946,"I wanted to dance, you know what I mean?"
00:02:35.155,00:02:37.824,"And that inspiration came from, you know, you."
00:02:38.032,00:02:39.993,And you've inspired me...
00:02:40.160,00:02:42.328,...and given me a reason to want to inspire others.
00:02:42.954,00:02:44.747,Uh....
00:02:45.540,00:02:46.958,"Life is hard, right?"
00:02:47.125,00:02:50.461,And I've kind of been searching for something to shake me up a little bit...
00:02:50.670,00:02:55.717,"...and give me a kind of a meaning, to believe in something."
00:02:55.967,00:02:59.137,And this is it.
00:03:16.571,00:03:20.199,"ORTEGA: So we open the show, as you know, with all the lights down."
00:03:20.408,00:03:23.912,We're gonna create a spectacular opening with pyrotechnics.
00:03:24.120,00:03:27.081,And we want some sizzles and some cracks and some pops.
00:03:27.290,00:03:30.752,We have our video that is called Glimpses and Flashes.
00:03:31.252,00:03:34.213,And that's where Light Man comes out on the gantry...
00:03:34.380,00:03:35.798,...floating above the stage...
00:03:36.007,00:03:41.095,...and he'll just be dazzling in video information.
00:03:44.098,00:03:46.643,And piece by piece by piece by piece...
00:03:46.851,00:03:49.354,"...MJ is revealed, until he jumps out..."
00:03:49.562,00:03:52.232,"...and on Michael's command, we begin."
00:05:53.978,00:05:55.605,"You know I'm gonna want that more, right?"
00:05:57.023,00:05:58.483,It's funkier.
00:05:58.691,00:06:00.401,I'm not feeling that part enough.
00:06:05.323,00:06:07.075,BEARDEN: As in running next to him.
00:06:07.241,00:06:09.035,"-It's not there. BEARDEN: Okay, it should be."
00:06:09.202,00:06:11.162,"It should be. I know, it's all for love."
00:06:11.370,00:06:14.207,BEARDEN: It's coming there. -We'll get it there.
00:06:40.983,00:06:44.278,Michael Jackson last performed live right here in London...
00:06:44.487,00:06:46.823,...at the 2006 World Music Awards.
00:06:49.200,00:06:50.493,Go straight onstage.
00:06:53.204,00:06:54.205,Yeah!
00:06:54.580,00:06:57.708,This is it. This is it.
00:07:03.381,00:07:05.466,I love you.
00:07:06.884,00:07:08.803,MAN: We love you!
00:07:10.555,00:07:15.977,I'll be-- I'll be performing the songs my fans wanna hear.
00:07:16.978,00:07:20.982,This is really it. This is the final curtain call.
00:07:22.233,00:07:24.861,Okay? And see you in July.
00:09:56.637,00:09:59.307,Good. Great. Good to see all of you. Thank you for being here.
00:10:00.891,00:10:03.561,The idea was get the big fish from all over the world...
00:10:03.728,00:10:05.479,...and put them in the same pond.
00:10:09.900,00:10:14.322,The dancers in a Michael Jackson show are an extension of Michael Jackson.
00:10:14.530,00:10:17.033,They are an extension of the man.
00:10:17.241,00:10:20.703,Everything is bigger and more intense in his world.
00:10:20.911,00:10:22.413,"First cut, thank you."
00:10:29.920,00:10:31.839,"Next group. Ladies, brava."
00:10:36.927,00:10:38.596,"WALKER: Lean, gorgeous, hot."
00:10:38.804,00:10:41.682,Dancers that can rock it. But if you don't have that goo...
00:10:41.932,00:10:44.769,"...that ooze coming out of you, not gonna get the job."
00:10:59.367,00:11:00.951,She's the one.
00:11:02.328,00:11:26.644,"And the Michael Jackson principal dancers for This Is It are: MAN 1: Guys, those go over here."
00:11:27.395,00:11:29.647,"Hey, guys? Those go over here, actually."
00:11:29.814,00:11:30.898,MAN 2: Aww.
00:11:31.065,00:11:32.858,Truss moving.
00:11:36.654,00:11:40.241,Quite the eventful day because we got to be toasted.
00:11:40.574,00:11:44.120,There's elevator speed and toaster speed.
00:11:45.079,00:11:47.540,"Part of this, guys, is anticipating the stop."
00:11:48.749,00:11:51.168,"Keep your shoulders square, keep your center..."
00:11:51.377,00:11:54.755,"...and just get, like, right down into a nice, good squat position like that..."
00:11:55.005,00:11:59.176,"...and you're gonna come up and-- -You feel that initial--? -Yeah, I do."
00:11:59.385,00:12:01.011,"Yeah, that's the adrenaline, baby."
00:15:06.614,00:15:09.575,"We're at Culver Studios, shooting green screen."
00:15:09.783,00:15:12.161,We're gonna do The Drill into Cadence...
00:15:12.328,00:15:13.913,...into They Don't Really Care About Us.
00:15:14.079,00:15:16.874,And it's gonna be really cool because they're gonna multiply the guys.
00:15:17.291,00:15:22.379,So our existing 11 guys are gonna become 1100 guys...
00:15:22.588,00:15:24.298,"...and it'll be really, really cool."
00:15:24.506,00:15:26.926,So we're kind of excited. And Michael's coming today.
00:15:27.134,00:15:28.594,MAN 1: There's the man. MAN 2: There's Michael.
00:15:28.802,00:15:29.803,MAN 1: The man is here.
00:15:30.012,00:15:31.722,MAN 3: Whoo! Ow! Ow!
00:15:31.889,00:15:34.808,So that we can give you this: a million people.
00:15:35.017,00:15:36.936,"Michael, do you like this, first of all?"
00:15:37.144,00:15:41.023,"Yeah, that's a cool move, a cool move, but it spreads out too much to the end."
00:15:41.231,00:15:43.734,JONES: So we can just stop it whenever you hit the space bar.
00:15:43.901,00:15:45.444,You can go to infinity.
00:15:45.611,00:15:50.115,"Yeah. As though there's no more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 perhaps?"
00:15:50.282,00:15:52.117,Or maybe just your nine dancers?
00:15:52.326,00:15:53.535,-Ten. -Great.
00:15:57.998,00:15:59.750,What is that?
00:16:02.544,00:16:04.588,"One more time. Six, seven, eight...."
00:18:45.249,00:18:51.463,...as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.
00:19:43.807,00:19:45.893,"ORTEGA: Hold for applause, hold for applause."
00:19:46.101,00:19:49.146,Slow umbrella fade out.
00:19:55.194,00:19:57.571,-Yeah. Yeah. -Let's just go for it.
00:20:19.051,00:20:20.093,MAN: Ooh!
00:20:53.961,00:20:55.420,"You sound great, MJ. You sound great."
00:21:00.425,00:21:02.386,"Bam, something right there."
00:25:21.603,00:25:22.896,"ORTEGA: We're seconds away, Mike."
00:25:23.104,00:25:24.814,MAN 1: Rolling. MAN 2: Rolling.
00:25:24.981,00:25:26.566,And Gilda singing.
00:25:37.160,00:25:38.828,MAN: Bravo!
00:25:49.547,00:25:50.840,What's he doing here?
00:26:04.062,00:26:06.231,And cut. Ha-ha-ha. That was a good one.
00:26:06.439,00:26:07.857,Let's cut.
00:26:08.066,00:26:09.192,"ORTEGA: Okay, Bruce? JONES: Yes, sir?"
00:26:09.359,00:26:11.528,"ORTEGA: Rehearsed, and Michael was great. We can do this."
00:26:11.695,00:26:12.696,JONES: Ready to shoot? ORTEGA: Yup.
00:26:12.904,00:26:15.657,"JONES: Okay, guys, let's shoot this. MAN: Here we go, ready."
00:26:15.865,00:26:18.201,-We are rolling. ORTEGA: Action.
00:26:28.753,00:26:32.048,What do you want me to do? Count three like they do in the movies?
00:26:46.938,00:26:48.606,"ORTEGA: Guys, that's the cue."
00:26:48.815,00:26:51.109,"I'm sorry, are we misunderstanding something here?"
00:26:51.318,00:26:52.402,"BEARDEN: No, we're not misunderstanding."
00:26:52.569,00:26:53.570,We're sizzling.
00:26:53.778,00:26:55.113,BEARDEN: He's sizzling. -I'm sizzling.
00:26:55.322,00:26:56.906,"He's waiting for my point, it's coming."
00:26:57.073,00:27:01.995,"ORTEGA: Oh, I thought-- Michael, I was telling them to start when you turn toward the audience."
00:27:02.162,00:27:03.163,Do you wanna--?
00:27:03.330,00:27:06.916,"Oh, no, I wanna turn first, face the audience with nothing."
00:27:07.083,00:27:08.126,ORTEGA: Okay.
00:27:08.293,00:27:10.503,"And then when he gets my cue, then we go."
00:27:10.670,00:27:11.838,ORTEGA: The only thing is...
00:27:12.005,00:27:15.925,...how will you see the video change from the marquee to the city?
00:27:16.301,00:27:18.803,"I gotta feel that. I'll feel it, the screen behind me."
00:27:19.012,00:27:23.058,"ORTEGA: All right. Now this is all sizzle, sizzle, sizzle."
00:27:23.266,00:27:24.934,It says Smooth Criminal.
00:27:25.143,00:27:27.312,The audience is going wild.
00:27:27.479,00:27:31.649,The camera now slowly starts to move over the marquee.
00:32:03.963,00:32:05.548,Pretty good. Pretty good.
00:32:21.606,00:32:23.232,BEARDEN: You're gonna put that in?
00:32:23.441,00:32:25.777,-Uh-huh. MAN: Uh-huh.
00:32:25.985,00:32:28.780,BEARDEN: It's really cool for me as a musical director...
00:32:28.988,00:32:31.282,...because I need the artist to be hands-on...
00:32:31.491,00:32:34.494,...and MJ is always hands-on with everything that he does.
00:32:34.744,00:32:37.455,He knows all of his records. He knows all of his tempos.
00:32:37.664,00:32:39.082,He knows all of his keys of songs.
00:32:40.541,00:32:42.877,"No. Just a little drag, a little bit more behind the beat."
00:32:43.086,00:32:44.754,Yeah. It's not the right sound.
00:32:44.921,00:32:46.756,Like you're dragging yourself out of bed.
00:32:46.965,00:32:49.342,Imagine this is the right sound. Check this.
00:32:55.598,00:32:57.600,"Don't change so soon, though."
00:32:57.809,00:33:17.912,"Don't wanna change over so soon yet. See, you're going: Don't do that one. Don't do that one."
00:33:18.121,00:33:20.081,"-Don't do that one yet? -No, no."
00:33:20.289,00:33:21.791,It should be simpler.
00:33:31.217,00:33:34.429,Uh-huh. Yeah.
00:33:37.306,00:33:39.142,"We'll get the sound, we'll get the sound."
00:33:39.350,00:33:41.477,BEARDEN: We'll get the sound but that's not till tomorrow.
00:33:41.728,00:33:43.980,MICHAEL: We gotta do a sound check tomorrow night.
00:33:44.188,00:33:45.314,That's what we need to do.
00:33:45.481,00:33:47.608,MICHAEL: And don't start unless you do a sound check.
00:33:47.817,00:33:49.569,"I know, that's why we doing it."
00:33:49.819,00:33:51.446,We need you to do the sound check...
00:33:51.654,00:33:53.489,...because can't nobody hear what you need to hear.
00:33:53.698,00:34:00.246,Some people might not wanna have that bass-- I want it the way I wrote it. I mean-- Like the audience hears it.
00:34:00.538,00:34:03.374,"So whatever the record's doing, that's how I want it to sound."
00:34:03.583,00:34:07.336,"That's what it's gonna sound like, but you gotta get closer to what you want."
00:34:07.503,00:34:10.298,Then if you wanna hear a little more booty on something else...
00:34:10.465,00:34:11.924,...know what I mean?
00:34:12.133,00:34:13.718,Only you can say that. You know what I'm saying?
00:34:15.136,00:34:16.512,A little more booty.
00:34:16.721,00:34:18.014,That's funny.
00:34:18.973,00:34:20.683,But you knew what I meant though too.
00:34:20.850,00:34:21.976,MICHAEL: I know exactly what you meant.
00:34:22.143,00:34:23.144,"Yeah, all right, then."
00:34:23.352,00:34:25.438,One more time from the top.
00:34:44.082,00:34:45.083,MICHAEL: Ssh-ssh.
00:34:45.291,00:34:47.585,Try to get the same sound.
00:34:52.924,00:34:55.802,MICHAEL: Good sound on that. Good sound.
00:35:00.014,00:35:01.641,"BEARDEN: No, no, not yet, Prince."
00:35:01.891,00:35:05.686,MICHAEL: No. You gotta-- You gotta let it simmer.
00:35:05.895,00:35:07.772,It's got a moment where it has to simmer.
00:35:07.980,00:35:10.399,BEARDEN: That's right. -You're not letting it simmer.
00:35:11.150,00:35:14.570,"Just bathe in the moonlight. You have to let it simmer a bit, you know?"
00:35:15.446,00:35:16.781,"BEARDEN: All right, Prince?"
00:35:16.948,00:35:19.534,We're gonna add two bars after the ch-ooh.
00:35:19.700,00:35:21.702,Or at least a bar.
00:35:22.912,00:35:25.206,"Yeah. MJ, check it from the top again."
00:35:25.414,00:35:27.083,"See what we got, simmer-wise."
00:35:27.291,00:35:29.544,"One, two, three, four."
00:37:00.384,00:37:02.094,I gotta cue that. I gotta cue that.
00:37:02.303,00:37:05.097,That shouldn't trigger on its own.
00:37:05.264,00:37:07.558,That can't trigger on its own.
00:37:07.767,00:37:09.602,I gotta cue that.
00:37:11.020,00:37:14.398,"So you gotta watch me for that growl, okay?"
00:39:19.065,00:39:20.483,One more time.
00:39:24.028,00:39:25.488,That's why we rehearse.

00:49:03.565,00:49:06.151,"I think that's smoother, you know what I mean?"

00:56:15.121,00:56:19.751,"Now, don't make me sing out when I shouldn't be singing out."
00:56:19.959,00:56:24.297,I'm warming-- I'm trying to warm up my voice for this moment.
00:56:24.506,00:56:27.801,Why do you do this to me? I shouldn't be singing right now.

00:56:45.652,00:56:47.112,I can't do that.
00:56:47.320,00:56:49.531,But you're fine to do it. I gotta save my voice.
00:56:49.739,00:56:53.451,That ending was just like the smelliest ending of all the versions.
00:56:53.993,00:56:55.829,"Band, it's just this."
00:56:56.871,00:56:59.082,This is what it is.

01:05:39.810,01:05:42.063,It's all about checking dimension...
01:05:42.229,01:05:44.273,...and widths and pipe and how things work together.

01:05:46.400,01:05:48.611,...is a big responsibility and a lot of fun...
01:05:48.819,01:05:52.531,...because we have to design things around the human body.
01:05:55.201,01:05:58.037,This is the first time in the history that we've worked with Michael...
01:05:58.245,01:06:02.208,"...for the past 25 years, that we are including lighted elements..."

01:06:34.281,01:06:37.743,...just to give him a little ride so that he feels his new cherry picker out.

01:14:26.462,01:14:31.216,"It's just-- His presence is just amazing. It's pretty, pretty cool. Really, really cool."
01:14:35.637,01:14:37.181,Thank you.
01:14:37.389,01:14:42.728,Michael is the epitome of one of the great entertainers of our time.
01:14:42.936,01:14:46.190,Performing with Michael has just been a thrill.
01:14:46.398,01:14:47.733,"You know, I've been, like..."
01:14:47.900,01:14:50.235,...a Michael Jackson fan since he was 8 years old.
01:14:50.444,01:14:53.739,It's like a lifelong dream for me to actually work with Michael.
01:14:53.947,01:14:56.492,"I've worked with a lot of great, great artists..."
01:14:56.700,01:14:59.036,"...but, you know, I consider this, like, really a pinnacle."
01:14:59.244,01:15:00.829,Michael's a perfectionist.
01:15:01.038,01:15:03.081,And you don't really find that in pop musicians.
01:15:03.248,01:15:04.583,You can't fool Michael.
01:15:04.791,01:15:06.585,You have to come in knowing the record.
01:15:06.793,01:15:08.837,"And then, hopefully, finding a middle ground..."
01:15:09.004,01:15:10.964,...to embellish it to make it even better.
01:15:11.173,01:15:13.550,He's just an icon of performance.
01:15:13.759,01:15:17.971,His talent runs so deep in creativity. And he draws from a deeper emotion...
01:15:18.180,01:15:20.516,...than anybody else I've ever seen or worked with.
01:15:21.225,01:15:23.227,"Right here, right here, right here."
01:15:23.435,01:15:26.855,"Okay, no second verse. Sorry. Okay, sorry, sorry."
01:15:27.606,01:15:29.441,"That was a mistake, there is no second verse."
01:15:29.608,01:15:30.984,"Sorry about that, you guys."
01:15:31.193,01:15:34.404,"First verse, oooh, then right to the bridge, okay?"
01:15:34.613,01:15:36.782,-Let's do it one more time. BEARDEN: Sure.
01:15:36.949,01:15:38.534,-Wanna go down then come back up? -One more time.
01:15:38.700,01:15:41.036,Yeah. This is why we have rehearsal.
01:15:41.203,01:15:42.496,BEARDEN: There you go.
01:16:37.342,01:16:39.386,So we'll run this way.
01:18:31.790,01:18:35.544,"When they stop, you have to just keep-- Just hit your highest note."
01:18:37.796,01:18:39.047,It's time for you to shine.
01:18:42.926,01:18:45.429,"And hit a high, long one."
01:18:46.930,01:18:48.598,"I mean, way up there."
01:18:49.516,01:18:51.351,It's your time to shine.
01:18:52.060,01:18:54.104,We'll be right there with you.
01:19:05.365,01:19:09.703,"It's remarkable, it's some genius stuff going on over here, man."
01:19:11.246,01:19:12.789,He is the king.
01:19:13.081,01:19:15.584,And he's a good guy too. He's real humble.
01:19:15.792,01:19:17.669,You know. And he knows his music.
01:19:17.878,01:19:21.506,What more can you ask for? Because I'm searching for that flavor too.
01:20:42.003,01:20:45.340,Look at that. I think it's beautiful.
01:20:45.841,01:20:47.551,Show him the second one.
01:20:47.759,01:20:50.178,"-It'll come rolling out at us, right? -Yes."
01:20:50.387,01:20:52.889,-And all golden. Look at this one. -It'll be floating so much.
01:20:53.098,01:20:54.432,I love her. I love the light.
01:20:54.641,01:20:57.060,"-God, and the lighting's great. ORTEGA: Yeah. You got it."
01:21:09.739,01:21:11.449,That's why it makes me so angry...
01:21:11.616,01:21:13.952,...when I see these things that are happening...
01:21:14.119,01:21:15.370,"...that every second, I hear..."
01:21:15.537,01:21:18.707,...the size of a football field is torn down in the Amazon.
01:21:18.915,01:21:21.334,"I mean, that kind of stuff really bothers me."
01:21:21.543,01:21:24.087,"That's why I write these kinds of songs, you know."
01:21:24.296,01:21:28.174,It gives some sense of awareness and awakening and hope to people.
01:21:28.633,01:21:30.802,I love the planet.
01:21:31.011,01:21:36.141,I love trees. I have this thing for trees and the colors and changing of leaves.
01:21:36.349,01:21:40.478,I love it. And I respect those kind of things.
01:28:06.281,01:28:08.408,The value would be greater...
01:28:08.616,01:28:10.576,...you let it rumble...
01:28:10.785,01:28:14.163,"...let it stay open, let it close in silence."
01:28:17.375,01:28:20.086,"And when that door opens, you start that piano."
01:28:26.301,01:28:27.760,God bless you.
01:28:30.722,01:28:35.059,...to compensate for man's mismanagement of the planet.
01:28:35.268,01:28:38.730,Because the planet is sick. Like a fever.
01:28:38.938,01:28:42.108,"If we don't fix it now, it's at the point of no return."
01:28:42.317,01:28:45.820,This is our last chance to fix this problem that we have...
01:28:46.070,01:28:48.239,...where it's like a runaway train...
01:28:48.448,01:28:50.700,...and the time has come. This is it.
01:28:50.908,01:28:52.869,I love you.
01:28:53.077,01:28:56.331,That'll be the ending of this under the words.
01:29:01.627,01:29:08.343,They'll take care of it. The government'll-- Don't worry. They'll-- They who? It starts with us. It's us.
01:29:08.551,01:29:10.970,Or else it'll never be done.
01:29:14.849,01:29:17.560,"Guys, can I have the lighting crew?"
01:29:17.769,01:29:19.812,-Travis? MAN: Yeah!
01:29:20.229,01:29:22.815,"First of all, Michael will be coming on from offstage..."
01:29:23.024,01:29:25.151,"...and he's got, like, an attaché case."
01:29:25.360,01:29:28.529,"And right here, Michael, you call it here."
01:29:29.614,01:29:30.782,So now it comes here.
01:29:30.948,01:29:33.034,So it's a light that is moving on his command.
01:29:33.242,01:29:35.870,-Absolutely. -Right? Then when he moves forward...
01:29:36.079,01:29:37.538,...he's in that light.
01:29:37.705,01:29:39.123,-Yeah. -He's in that light.
01:29:39.332,01:29:42.335,But I wanna be able to step into the pool once I'm fully dressed.
01:29:42.543,01:29:45.880,"So that-- So after he does this-- Why don't you do this, Michael?"
01:29:46.089,01:29:48.466,After you go like this and you send that down...
01:29:48.674,01:29:51.010,...a gesture and a pool of light comes on.
01:29:51.219,01:29:53.596,Now a pool of light comes on down here...
01:29:53.763,01:29:56.516,-...wherever his light is... MAN: Mm-hm. Yeah.
01:29:56.724,01:30:02.313,"...and the pool of light comes on and now he'll walk into it, center stage."
01:30:04.565,01:30:06.150,And now he'll start.
01:36:03.757,01:36:05.843,"MAN 1: Ho, ho, ho!"
01:36:10.848,01:36:12.766,MAN 2: Oh! Oh!
01:36:25.321,01:36:26.906,I know.
01:36:27.156,01:36:29.825,At least we get a feel of it.
01:36:30.701,01:36:32.161,God bless you.
01:36:42.463,01:36:44.173,Church.
01:36:45.049,01:36:47.718,The church of rock and roll.
01:36:49.637,01:36:50.679,BEARDEN: I'm a fan.
01:36:50.888,01:36:52.097,God bless you.
01:36:52.306,01:36:53.933,Get some water.
01:36:58.229,01:37:01.398,ORTEGA: I just wanna say as Michael's creative partner in this venture...
01:37:01.607,01:37:04.610,...this has been one of the most extraordinary experiences...
01:37:04.777,01:37:06.278,...of my creative life.
01:37:06.445,01:37:08.822,I am so proud and so thrilled and so excited...
01:37:09.031,01:37:12.034,...and I just wanna thank everybody for their extraordinary work.
01:37:12.243,01:37:15.538,And I'm gonna just give this to Michael now.
01:37:16.455,01:37:18.165,Everybody's doing a great job.
01:37:18.374,01:37:22.753,Let's continue and believe and have faith.
01:37:22.962,01:37:28.092,"Give me your all, your endurance, your patience, and your understanding."
01:37:28.300,01:37:31.971,"But it's an adventure, it's a great adventure."
01:37:32.179,01:37:34.056,It's nothing to be nervous about.
01:37:34.265,01:37:37.434,"They just want wonderful experiences, they want escapism."
01:37:37.643,01:37:40.396,We wanna take them places that they've never been before.
01:37:40.604,01:37:43.357,We wanna show them talent like they've never seen before.
01:37:43.566,01:37:44.984,So give your all.
01:37:45.192,01:37:47.027,And I love you all. And we're a family.
01:37:47.194,01:37:48.571,Just know that. We're a family.
01:37:48.779,01:37:50.030,-That's right. -Amen.
01:37:50.239,01:37:55.744,We're putting love back into the world to remind the world that love is important.
01:37:55.953,01:37:59.373,Love is important. To love each other. We're all one. That's the message.
01:37:59.582,01:38:01.166,And take care of the planet.
01:38:01.375,01:38:04.503,We have four years to get it right or else it's irreversible...
01:38:04.670,01:38:05.796,...the damage we've done.
01:38:06.005,01:38:08.882,So we have an important message to give.
01:38:09.049,01:38:10.509,Okay? It's important.
01:38:10.676,01:38:13.178,But I thank you for your cooperation so far.
01:38:13.345,01:38:14.972,Thank you. Big thank you.
01:38:17.099,01:38:19.476,Blessings! Blessings to all.

01:38:53.260,01:38:57.181,"What I'd like to do right now is just run, for a sound check, Man in the Mirror."
01:38:57.389,01:39:00.100,-Okay. -And then we'll talk about the ending.
01:39:00.309,01:39:02.353,MJ Air.
01:39:03.479,01:39:04.938,Your favorite part.
01:39:05.147,01:39:06.899,Right?
01:39:07.650,01:39:09.860,-They'd love that. -You have to do it like MJ.
01:39:10.069,01:39:11.111,"No, no, no."
01:39:11.320,01:39:12.571,PAYNE: You know you love that part.
01:39:12.780,01:39:13.781,I love when you....
01:39:14.406,01:39:15.532,"No, no."
01:39:16.075,01:39:19.787,"That's how the stewardesses do it, I love when they do that."
01:39:20.412,01:39:21.538,I love it.
01:39:21.747,01:39:25.834,"When I was in third grade, the first song I sang in school was Man in the Mirror."
01:39:26.043,01:39:28.754,"So it's kind of cool, like, going from that to this..."
01:39:28.962,01:39:30.673,...singing it onstage with Michael.
01:39:31.131,01:39:34.134,So it's just an amazing experience to be onstage with him.
01:39:34.343,01:39:35.636,He's such an amazing artist.
01:42:41.363,01:42:45.450,"WOMAN: Ready? One, two, three, uh...."
01:49:42.325,01:49:43.535,There should be a break there.
01:49:43.702,01:49:45.287,"BEARDEN: Yeah, we gotta work that out."
01:49:45.453,01:49:46.538,"Have it right there, okay?"
01:49:46.705,01:49:48.456,"BEARDEN: Yeah, we gotta work that one out."
01:49:48.707,01:49:51.209,Let me bathe in my own time when I come back in.
01:49:51.418,01:49:52.711,"BEARDEN: Yeah, you got it."
01:49:52.919,01:49:56.673,I'm gonna button my shirt or my jacket or whatever it is.
01:49:56.881,01:50:00.427,"I'm gonna look around a little bit, play with them."
01:50:02.512,01:50:04.472,"Snap my fingers maybe, then bam!"
01:50:58.068,01:50:59.611,Whoo!
