00:00:46.379,00:00:48.339,Are you sure this is the best idea?
00:01:00.602,00:01:01.603,Go fish.
00:01:06.566,00:01:08.693,"Hey, it's your turn."
00:01:13.156,00:01:14.240,"Uh, um..."
00:01:24.709,00:01:28.755,The Resolute made 23 routine trips. So what happened to ours?
00:01:35.678,00:01:36.679,Helmets on.
00:01:51.945,00:01:54.155,"Okay. Um, it's still my turn."
00:02:00.328,00:02:02.163,Do you have any nines?
00:02:04.666,00:02:05.917,Did you see my hand?
00:02:07.293,00:02:08.670,I don't know why everyone doesn't.
00:02:08.753,00:02:10.588,"Okay, can I have my nine, please?"
00:02:23.977,00:02:25.270,Remember your training.
00:02:26.521,00:02:29.899,The computer will land us just fine. That's what it's for.
00:02:58.177,00:03:00.054,Landing trajectory off course.
00:03:02.724,00:03:04.517,-Mom! -Take my hand.
00:03:16.571,00:03:18.823,Entry angle exceeding parameters.
00:03:20.992,00:03:22.160,Take my hand.
00:03:22.535,00:03:26.247,"1,000 feet. Brace for impact. Brace for impact. Brace for impact."
00:03:45.225,00:03:46.476,Penny accounted for.
00:03:49.103,00:03:52.607,Will? Will? Are you all right?
00:03:52.690,00:03:53.608,Accounted for.
00:04:01.824,00:04:02.659,Maureen?
00:04:05.161,00:04:06.829,It's fine. It's just stuck.
00:04:07.330,00:04:10.458,It's okay. I got this. You go get the supplies.
00:04:20.176,00:04:22.637,"Quick, to the top hatch. Come on."
00:04:23.680,00:04:25.431,In here. Come on.
00:04:54.836,00:04:55.837,I don't fit.
00:04:56.879,00:04:57.964,We'll have to go around.
00:04:59.966,00:05:02.051,Don't go anywhere. We'll come around.
00:05:47.638,00:05:48.723,Wow.
00:06:11.162,00:06:12.538,At least eight.
00:06:13.081,00:06:14.791,We're not the only ones that made it.
00:06:18.878,00:06:20.254,"Here, sit down."
00:06:24.175,00:06:26.094,Lucky I just happened to be here.
00:06:26.886,00:06:27.845,Lucky thing.
00:07:00.586,00:07:02.004,"So, who's my Secret Santa?"
00:07:10.346,00:07:12.432,-Ta-da! -Are those my mom's cookies?
00:07:12.515,00:07:15.810,"Grandma wasn't here to bake them this year, so, gave it a shot."
00:07:15.893,00:07:17.979,She never trusted me with the recipe.
00:07:18.062,00:07:19.772,"I don't know, I guess I'm just special?"
00:07:21.899,00:07:23.734,"So, where are you these days?"
00:07:24.861,00:07:25.987,You know he can't say.
00:07:26.904,00:07:38.458,"Well, wherever you are, it's night, which rules out Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Australia-- Is that our hedge?"
00:07:42.753,00:07:43.796,What?
00:07:44.380,00:07:45.798,You guys are too smart.
00:07:56.392,00:07:57.477,Let me in.
00:08:05.818,00:08:06.861,What did you bring me?
00:08:09.906,00:08:12.658,You know how many strings I had to pull to get here?
00:08:23.836,00:08:24.670,What?
00:08:25.922,00:08:26.756,When?
00:08:28.090,00:08:34.555,"Astronomers at the Near-Earth Object office discovered a sizable, unknown celestial object that's headed our way."
00:08:34.680,00:08:40.311,NASA scientists are working around the clock to track the object's orbital path and to assess the risk of collision.
00:08:40.394,00:08:41.354,I have it.
00:08:41.437,00:08:42.980,A news briefing has been scheduled...
00:08:44.106,00:08:45.691,"I'm gonna take a look, okay, Mom?"
00:08:49.028,00:08:49.862,It's broken.
00:08:50.780,00:08:51.781,"Well, that's too bad."
00:08:55.868,00:08:58.746,"Hey, you took time to grab that? Who were you planning to call?"
00:08:58.829,00:09:01.082,I grabbed a pack. I did what I was supposed to do.
00:09:01.165,00:09:02.959,"Hey, kids, it could be worse."
00:09:03.042,00:09:04.335,How?
00:09:08.214,00:09:11.008,"Hey, what are you doing? We haven't tested the atmosphere."
00:09:11.759,00:09:14.303,You already did. Look.
00:09:15.888,00:09:17.932,"If the air was toxic, you'd be dead by now."
00:09:30.111,00:09:31.654,First fresh air in months.
00:09:46.502,00:09:49.797,"Mayday, mayday. This is Jupiter 2. Do you read? Over."
00:09:55.219,00:09:59.015,Probably should have read the fine print before I launched into space.
00:10:02.226,00:10:07.732,We evacuated the Resolute halfway between home and the colony-- Just call it Earth. It's not your home anymore.
00:10:09.233,00:10:11.736,Earth and the colony.
00:10:11.819,00:10:14.322,This planet is unlike any we have ever mapped.
00:10:14.405,00:10:17.325,"Wherever we are, I... It's a Goldilocks planet."
00:10:17.408,00:10:20.202,"Earth-like atmosphere, air-pressure, gravity."
00:10:20.286,00:10:22.913,Clearly no lack of water. It's...
00:10:23.789,00:10:25.583,The odds of that happening are...
00:10:26.751,00:10:28.127,It's like winning the lottery.
00:10:28.210,00:10:30.963,The way not dying in a car accident is like winning the lottery.
00:10:31.047,00:10:33.090,Until you remember you were in a car accident.
00:10:35.217,00:10:36.218,No kidding.
00:10:40.056,00:10:42.433,I can't raise any of the other Jupiters.
00:10:46.395,00:10:48.773,I'm sure they'll follow emergency protocol.
00:10:49.357,00:10:50.983,"Hey, where does it hurt?"
00:10:51.400,00:10:54.737,-All across here. -It's from the crash harness. It's normal.
00:10:55.029,00:10:56.322,"To you, maybe. Not to him."
00:10:56.405,00:10:57.740,He didn't mean anything by it.
00:10:57.823,00:11:00.076,"Yeah, maybe he just forgot we're not under his command."
00:11:00.660,00:11:01.702,It's okay.
00:11:03.454,00:11:05.790,You're all right. Inhale.
00:11:16.675,00:11:18.094,Is that another crashed ship?
00:11:18.719,00:11:20.388,You're disappointing me. Look at the color.
00:11:20.805,00:11:22.348,It's bright white...
00:11:22.431,00:11:24.016,"If it was rocket fuel, it would be reddish."
00:11:24.100,00:11:25.017,Right.
00:11:25.893,00:11:26.811,"Okay, hint."
00:11:26.894,00:11:29.021,"It's not a chemistry question, it's a geology question."
00:11:34.360,00:11:38.489,"Once that water freezes, the Jupiter's gonna be locked in 50 feet of solid ice."
00:11:39.573,00:11:41.325,-How long do we have? -A while.
00:11:41.701,00:11:43.494,-How long's a while? -It depends.
00:11:44.495,00:11:50.251,"On hull thermodynamics, water salinity, how much displacement there is... It's complicated. Does it matter?"
00:11:50.334,00:11:52.837,You tell me. I know you've already done the calculations.
00:11:55.005,00:11:56.757,We should talk about this privately.
00:11:56.841,00:11:58.801,You two mind letting us in on this?
00:12:06.225,00:12:16.694,"In six hours, the sun's gonna go down, and indications are, it will drop to 60 degrees below zero, at which point, our power cells will die-- And so will we."
00:12:17.903,00:12:19.405,We can't go anywhere because of your leg.
00:12:19.488,00:12:21.824,-I'm still figuring it out. -What if you can't?
00:12:21.907,00:12:22.950,Then you leave me here.
00:12:23.033,00:12:25.494,You descend the glacier and it'll be warmer down there.
00:12:25.578,00:12:26.579,"-Mom, stop! -No, Mom!"
00:12:31.000,00:12:34.044,"We go back down, get one of the big ion lithiums to recharge the suits."
00:12:34.128,00:12:35.254,Not with that tear in your suit.
00:12:35.337,00:12:37.715,"Airlock's too far, you'll be dead in minutes."
00:12:37.798,00:12:39.091,The broken top hatch.
00:12:40.801,00:12:42.136,It's closer.
00:12:45.931,00:12:48.142,-It'll only be a quick trip in and out. -No.
00:12:48.225,00:12:49.351,He's the only one who'll fit.
00:12:49.435,00:12:50.644,No. Absolutely not.
00:12:50.728,00:12:52.771,"He did the same training, passed the same tests."
00:12:56.984,00:12:58.861,"-Will, come with me. -John?"
00:13:01.280,00:13:03.240,Okay. You gotta listen to me.
00:13:03.324,00:13:06.452,All you have to do is go back in the same way you came out.
00:13:06.535,00:13:10.039,Supply room's right there. It's easy.
00:13:14.627,00:13:18.297,"Okay. Hey, hey, buddy."
00:13:18.547,00:13:22.635,It's no different from the EVA tank training you did back home. Okay?
00:13:22.927,00:13:24.220,I'm gonna get the suit.
00:13:31.727,00:13:34.813,"Okay, here we go. Let's put this back on."
00:13:49.662,00:13:52.164,"Judy, get back up here right now."
00:13:54.124,00:13:56.335,You know you won't fit through the top hatch.
00:13:58.379,00:14:00.798,"The top hatch isn't the only way in, Dad."
00:14:01.423,00:14:04.009,The supply room is too far from the aft airlock.
00:14:04.093,00:14:05.386,It's too risky.
00:14:06.804,00:14:08.806,"You take risks for a living, Dad."
00:14:08.889,00:14:11.642,"No, I take orders. And I'm giving you one right now."
00:14:12.601,00:14:13.936,I'm already in.
00:14:16.981,00:14:20.484,Listen to me. She's gonna be okay. Okay?
00:14:20.568,00:14:23.863,She's always okay. It's actually really annoying.
00:14:38.085,00:14:39.920,The bulkhead's jammed. I can't get through.
00:14:40.004,00:14:42.423,"Okay. Well, that settles it. Get back up here right now."
00:14:49.346,00:14:50.431,I can make it.
00:14:59.315,00:15:00.149,Damn it.
00:15:00.232,00:15:02.318,"Honey, I don't know when the water's gonna freeze."
00:15:04.820,00:15:05.654,I'm fine.
00:15:23.255,00:15:24.798,"Hey, Judy?"
00:15:26.050,00:15:27.801,"Judy, why can't we see you by now?"
00:15:30.846,00:15:33.098,-Judy? -I took a Chariot battery.
00:15:34.016,00:15:35.768,You're down in the garage?
00:15:37.102,00:15:38.562,Get out of there right now.
00:15:39.647,00:15:40.606,"Yeah, good idea."
00:15:47.112,00:15:49.073,Faster. Move.
00:15:51.492,00:15:52.451,Hurry!
00:15:54.828,00:15:55.788,"Come on, Judy."
00:16:00.334,00:16:01.210,Drop the battery.
00:16:01.543,00:16:02.670,Drop the battery!
00:16:11.345,00:16:12.262,Take my hand.
00:16:30.489,00:16:33.450,"Okay. Okay. Okay, listen."
00:16:40.040,00:16:42.584,"-Penny, get the computer. -Okay."
00:16:46.255,00:16:49.216,Your suit will keep you warm. And...
00:16:51.719,00:16:54.430,-you've got at least five hours of oxygen. -Okay.
00:16:54.513,00:16:57.182,"So just don't talk any more than you have to, okay?"
00:17:07.860,00:17:11.447,Hey... you're in worse shape than you look.
00:17:14.074,00:17:15.659,You need to get some rest.
00:17:15.993,00:17:17.411,I need to help my baby girl.
00:17:17.494,00:17:19.621,We will. We will.
00:17:26.587,00:17:29.339,No more doing anything until I say so.
00:17:34.636,00:17:35.679,Maureen.
00:17:37.347,00:17:38.265,Maureen.
00:17:52.571,00:17:53.447,Judy...
00:17:54.740,00:17:57.576,"-Judy, I just want to say-- -Don't talk to me, please."
00:18:17.638,00:18:19.640,"You're almost to me, right?"
00:18:23.727,00:18:26.647,"Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm getting there."
00:18:54.842,00:18:55.843,What is it?
00:18:57.219,00:18:59.805,The white fire. I figured out what it is.
00:19:00.305,00:19:01.390,I don't have time for this.
00:19:03.725,00:19:08.021,"I mean, when we crashed, we must have scraped open a pure vein of it."
00:19:10.232,00:19:11.692,Magnesium.
00:19:13.610,00:19:17.489,Magnesium burns hot. But you know what makes it burn hotter?
00:19:20.909,00:19:21.743,Ice.
00:19:25.831,00:19:28.625,"Judy, I gotta go get something."
00:19:28.709,00:19:30.627,-You're leaving? -It'll help get you out.
00:19:30.919,00:19:31.962,I'll be back.
00:19:44.391,00:19:50.981,"-Gonna have to hold down the fort. -It's actually more of a tent, but-- You'll be fine. Just radio me if anything goes wrong."
00:19:54.109,00:19:55.235,"Will, you coming?"
00:19:56.612,00:19:57.446,Me?
00:19:57.529,00:20:01.074,"Yeah, it's your idea. And I don't know what I'm looking for."
00:20:01.700,00:20:02.534,Come on.
00:20:07.414,00:20:08.707,"I'll see you later, okay?"
00:20:58.924,00:21:01.677,"Hi. Can I look at this one, please? Thank you."
00:21:06.306,00:21:08.350,It looks really expensive.
00:21:08.433,00:21:10.269,"Mom, it's babysitting money."
00:21:10.352,00:21:12.354,It's like being paid to study.
00:21:12.437,00:21:16.191,"I know we're not doing Secret Santa, but I wanna get a gift for Dad, in case he shows up."
00:21:19.111,00:21:20.112,He's done it before.
00:21:20.195,00:21:22.823,I just don't want you to be disappointed again.
00:21:22.906,00:21:25.534,"Well, it's a good thing I got thick skin."
00:21:27.452,00:21:29.538,You shouldn't have to have thick skin.
00:21:30.747,00:21:33.125,He's been in the worst of it for two years.
00:21:33.208,00:21:35.377,"Mom, he's made sacrifices. So should we."
00:21:36.503,00:21:38.046,"-Okay. -Can I take that, please?"
00:21:38.130,00:21:40.299,"Oh, here. I'll put it on the card."
00:21:40.382,00:21:42.884,Just for the points. You can pay me when I get the bill.
00:21:42.968,00:21:43.969,"Sure, okay."
00:21:46.763,00:21:48.682,How easy is it to return this?
00:21:49.308,00:21:51.852,"It's fine, as long as it hasn't been worn."
00:21:52.436,00:21:53.854,Yeah. It won't be.
00:21:54.187,00:21:57.524,"Hey, Mom, I'm gonna go find a present for Judy."
00:21:57.607,00:22:01.194,"She told me to give it to charity, but she's just trying to make me look bad."
00:22:12.039,00:22:13.040,How's Mom?
00:22:13.749,00:22:15.500,I thought you weren't supposed to be talking.
00:22:21.214,00:22:23.008,"Seriously, how is she?"
00:22:23.842,00:22:26.511,She's... She's still out. Uh...
00:22:27.095,00:22:30.057,Breathing and her heart rate is normal.
00:22:32.934,00:22:34.019,Keep talking.
00:22:34.728,00:22:37.773,Pretty high up on the list of things I never thought I'd hear you say.
00:22:37.856,00:22:40.275,You must have some books loaded on your phone.
00:22:41.526,00:22:42.861,Do you have anything good?
00:22:43.695,00:22:48.950,"I, in fact, happen to have some of the best books ever written."
00:22:49.326,00:22:57.667,"Complete Dickens, complete Shakespeare-- Do you have anything... trashy?"
00:22:58.585,00:23:01.379,Why would I bring something trashy to the new world?
00:23:01.463,00:23:05.425,We're here to establish a colony to expand the bounds of human experience.
00:23:05.801,00:23:06.760,Hmm.
00:23:07.219,00:23:10.138,"Well, they say everyone should read Moby-Dick before they die."
00:23:15.268,00:23:18.146,"-Don't say that. -Well, do you have it?"
00:23:19.981,00:23:21.525,Of course I have it.
00:23:22.150,00:23:23.360,"Well, is it any good?"
00:23:28.365,00:23:29.533,I don't know.
00:23:30.242,00:23:33.036,Um... I haven't gotten to the M's yet.
00:23:34.621,00:23:36.748,"Well, proceed."
00:23:47.259,00:23:48.385,Call me Ishmael.
00:23:48.468,00:23:50.804,"Okay, Ishmael, if you insist."
00:23:50.887,00:23:53.974,"Okay, first of all, that wasn't even remotely funny."
00:23:54.057,00:23:59.437,"And, secondly, you're supposed to be conserving oxygen. So, quiet."
00:24:01.731,00:24:03.066,Call me Ishmael.
00:24:05.277,00:24:08.405,"Some years ago, never mind how long precisely..."
00:24:22.627,00:24:24.629,Don't wanna fall down a crevasse.
00:24:24.713,00:24:26.464,"Wait, that could happen?"
00:24:28.300,00:24:29.509,Just follow my lead.
00:24:33.263,00:24:34.514,"So, uh..."
00:24:35.599,00:24:37.684,So what are you into nowadays?
00:24:38.018,00:24:39.978,"I mean, besides magnesium."
00:24:45.025,00:24:46.318,"Yeah, well, they do that."
00:24:47.485,00:24:49.487,"You're good at something, they make you do it."
00:24:52.324,00:24:54.367,I remember you used to like baseball.
00:24:55.744,00:24:56.703,Yeah.
00:24:59.456,00:25:01.208,"Yeah, I used to."
00:25:01.666,00:25:02.626,Models?
00:25:03.585,00:25:05.170,Does anyone make models anymore?
00:25:06.671,00:25:08.006,I like to read.
00:25:10.383,00:25:15.764,I don't think I've read anything except instruction manuals for... years.
00:25:24.898,00:25:26.024,"Oh, damn."
00:25:27.234,00:25:31.488,Yes. That... That's a lot of magnesium.
00:25:31.571,00:25:32.697,Well...
00:25:34.491,00:25:36.993,What do you say we go get some that isn't burning?
00:25:38.036,00:25:38.870,Come on.
00:25:58.473,00:26:04.104,"What? Mom! Mom, easy. Easy, easy, easy, easy."
00:26:04.437,00:26:07.399,-Where's Will? -He went with Dad to get some magnesium.
00:26:08.275,00:26:09.109,What?
00:26:11.319,00:26:12.529,Whose idea was that?
00:26:14.364,00:26:15.198,Will's.
00:26:19.869,00:26:21.037,What're we looking for?
00:26:22.247,00:26:24.040,It's that grayish stuff there.
00:26:29.004,00:26:31.339,That's what it looks like before it ignites.
00:26:31.923,00:26:35.552,"Hey, I'm, uh... I'm not gonna blow us up, am I?"
00:26:37.137,00:26:38.596,Not unless you make a spark.
00:26:40.807,00:26:41.641,Okay.
00:26:50.275,00:26:53.194,-How long have we been gone? -Judy's got plenty of time.
00:26:58.450,00:27:00.827,"Hey, it happened."
00:27:02.162,00:27:04.581,It happened because I froze up.
00:27:04.664,00:27:07.959,You jumped through a lot of hoops to get on this mission.
00:27:08.543,00:27:11.212,You earned your spot just like everyone else.
00:27:11.296,00:27:12.881,I don't feel like everyone else.
00:27:21.097,00:27:23.308,I think we've got enough to get her out.
00:27:23.391,00:27:25.310,"Now, let's get out of here before it blows up."
00:27:43.286,00:27:46.831,"Will, do you read me? Will!"
00:27:58.385,00:28:00.136,"It's getting worse, isn't it?"
00:28:01.346,00:28:03.431,Feels like my leg is in a vice.
00:28:06.226,00:28:08.311,"Penny, I think we should take a look."
00:28:09.979,00:28:12.273,-We? -Does the skin feel hard or soft?
00:28:22.534,00:28:25.328,"Yeah, her leg is hard as a rock."
00:28:25.453,00:28:28.039,"Okay. Mom, I think you have compartment syndrome."
00:28:28.456,00:28:31.459,Edema from the fracture has created too much pressure in your leg.
00:28:31.543,00:28:32.460,We have to release it.
00:28:32.544,00:28:35.004,"Penny's gonna have to do a little procedure, okay?"
00:28:36.506,00:28:38.800,-I'll talk her through it. -It's your call.
00:28:38.883,00:28:41.386,"Penny, there's a combo syringe in the kit."
00:28:51.146,00:28:56.192,It's okay? Okay. Okay. Yeah.
00:28:59.154,00:29:01.406,Okay. We have to do a four-compartment fasciotomy.
00:29:01.489,00:29:03.324,How hard is this procedure?
00:29:04.200,00:29:07.203,-I've heard it's pretty straightforward. -You've heard it's pretty straight...
00:29:09.038,00:29:10.415,You haven't done this before?
00:29:11.124,00:29:14.252,"Okay. Lay out the scalpel and plenty of gauze, okay?"
00:29:14.878,00:29:19.674,"Okay. Yeah, that's fine. Okay."
00:29:27.766,00:29:28.725,Okay.
00:29:28.808,00:29:34.397,There are four spaces in the lower leg containing muscle -that are surrounded by fascia. -By what?
00:29:34.481,00:29:37.066,You know that white stuff you see when you eat steak?
00:29:37.150,00:29:39.277,"That's fascia. The red stuff, it's muscle."
00:29:39.360,00:29:40.195,Okay.
00:29:43.948,00:29:45.492,I like steak.
00:29:45.575,00:29:48.578,"This is not Mom, this is steak."
00:29:50.038,00:29:50.997,Yeah.
00:29:51.080,00:29:53.583,Find the bone that sticks out under the kneecap.
00:29:54.250,00:30:00.340,"Move about two fingers away from it down on either side, -and cut all the way down. -Okay."
00:30:00.715,00:30:02.258,Cut all the way down to where?
00:30:02.342,00:30:03.968,All the way down to her ankle.
00:30:07.013,00:30:09.557,"Penny, you have to cut deep, okay?"
00:30:09.641,00:30:13.311,Until you see the muscle. The steak. Cut until you see the steak.
00:30:14.354,00:30:19.108,"The steak. Okay, it's just a really juicy piece of steak."
00:30:19.651,00:30:21.569,I'm done! Done! I did it!
00:30:21.653,00:30:24.239,Great. Now you only have to do it three times more.
00:30:35.834,00:30:36.793,Dad?
00:30:38.253,00:30:39.796,"Dad, come in."
00:31:18.751,00:31:20.879,"Yeah. Yeah, I'm here."
00:31:23.548,00:31:24.549,Are you hurt?
00:31:25.300,00:31:26.134,No.
00:31:26.718,00:31:27.719,Thank God.
00:31:28.970,00:31:30.555,Can you get back up here?
00:31:35.727,00:31:37.937,No. I don't think so.
00:31:41.524,00:31:42.609,Are you safe?
00:31:43.860,00:31:46.863,There's vegetation all over the place.
00:31:46.946,00:31:49.866,So there's bound to be things that eat the vegetation...
00:31:50.325,00:31:53.494,and things that eat those things.
00:31:53.953,00:31:56.789,Okay. Just... Just don't touch anything.
00:31:56.873,00:32:00.418,Yeah. Just get down here soon. Okay?
00:32:00.501,00:32:03.129,"Of course I will. But I, uh..."
00:32:07.050,00:32:08.134,It's gonna take some time.
00:32:09.969,00:32:11.471,Time your sister doesn't have.
00:32:11.554,00:32:12.430,Wait.
00:32:13.765,00:32:15.058,"Wait, you're leaving?"
00:32:15.850,00:32:18.728,I have to go help Judy first.
00:32:18.811,00:32:22.231,And then I'm turning around and coming straight back here.
00:32:22.941,00:32:24.943,"I'll be back soon, I promise."
00:32:28.321,00:32:29.781,You're going to be fine.
00:32:32.158,00:32:33.076,Will?
00:32:34.827,00:32:36.496,You got that? You're gonna be fine.
00:32:41.751,00:32:42.710,Go save her.
00:32:46.005,00:32:47.298,You have to.
00:32:55.473,00:32:56.724,I'll be fine.
00:33:09.028,00:33:11.406,It's crazy that they built this thing for real.
00:33:13.491,00:33:15.410,Someday we're gonna be on it.
00:33:16.369,00:33:17.245,You are.
00:33:18.705,00:33:21.833,"Hey, the test results haven't come in yet. Wait until they do."
00:33:23.459,00:33:25.837,I froze up. And...
00:33:26.421,00:33:30.425,the man giving the test made a face when I stepped out of the tank.
00:33:31.509,00:33:33.678,"He made a face at me, too."
00:33:35.096,00:33:38.391,It's their job. To make faces.
00:33:43.021,00:33:45.231,"If I didn't pass, then..."
00:33:48.818,00:33:50.987,that means they're gonna make me stay behind.
00:33:56.701,00:33:58.369,"So, we need to get something clear."
00:33:59.537,00:34:00.538,Look at me.
00:34:03.124,00:34:08.463,There's a rule that's written in stone. And it is never broken.
00:34:10.798,00:34:13.217,The Robinsons stick together.
00:34:22.435,00:34:23.686,What are you doing?
00:34:25.271,00:34:27.482,I'll just borrow your manuals when they come in.
00:35:00.306,00:35:02.975,"When you were little, I always loved to watch you sleep."
00:35:03.893,00:35:05.937,I don't think you should be moving around.
00:35:07.021,00:35:08.564,"Well, it's excellent work."
00:35:09.941,00:35:15.029,"No, Judy did the hard part. The studying and the exams..."
00:35:18.825,00:35:21.911,"You're all that matters, you know. You three."
00:35:23.996,00:35:25.706,It's why we left.
00:35:27.208,00:35:30.419,I wanted to find a home that was worthy of you.
00:35:36.217,00:35:37.426,We're gonna make it.
00:35:39.971,00:35:41.389,Of course we are.
00:35:45.143,00:35:46.978,Every problem has a solution.
00:37:04.889,00:37:05.890,"Hi, Will."
00:37:12.230,00:37:18.361,"Yeah, I heard colony tortillas leave a funny aftertaste because of the hybrid corn."
00:37:24.575,00:37:25.660,Yes.
00:37:27.828,00:37:29.121,We're celebrating.
00:37:56.774,00:38:00.319,This is Will Robinson of the Jupiter 2. Over.
00:38:01.988,00:38:03.614,Calling any survivors.
00:38:07.243,00:38:08.327,Do you copy?
00:39:27.198,00:39:30.743,Hello? Hello? Is anyone there?
00:40:06.153,00:40:08.072,That's not a Jupiter.
00:40:21.168,00:40:24.839,This is Will Robinson of the 24th Colonist Group.
00:40:25.673,00:40:28.884,I'm making a record of this because it seems...
00:40:30.136,00:40:35.307,I'm the first human to discover evidence of an alien intelligence.
00:40:39.478,00:40:42.356,It... It appears it crashed when we did.
00:40:43.149,00:40:45.776,Why? I don't know why.
00:40:47.403,00:40:49.405,I don't even know why we crashed.
00:40:53.993,00:40:56.203,and appears to be non-functional.
00:40:57.329,00:41:01.292,No sign of any... pa-- passengers.
00:42:23.332,00:42:24.792,No! No!
00:42:25.251,00:42:26.377,No. No.
00:42:33.175,00:42:36.512,"Judy, I'm back. I'm gonna get you out of there."
00:42:38.222,00:42:40.683,-Where's Will? -I'm gonna go back for him.
00:42:40.766,00:42:42.810,What? What happened?
00:42:42.893,00:42:44.770,"We got separated, but he's okay."
00:42:44.853,00:42:46.355,You just left him there?
00:42:46.438,00:42:47.940,I can only save one child at a time.
00:42:52.820,00:42:53.696,Better get back.
00:42:58.284,00:43:01.495,"Penny, how much air does she have left?"
00:43:07.585,00:43:09.920,Judy. Close your eyes.
00:43:11.088,00:43:12.298,Keep them closed.
00:43:23.851,00:43:24.977,Wow.
00:43:31.150,00:43:33.694,It's working. Thank God.
00:43:33.777,00:43:35.070,It was Will's idea.
00:43:35.738,00:43:37.364,Yeah. I know.
00:43:39.199,00:43:41.577,He thinks he doesn't deserve to be here.
00:43:43.162,00:43:45.873,I'll discuss that with him the next time I see him.
00:43:47.416,00:43:48.667,When do you think that might be?
00:43:55.758,00:43:56.759,Thanks.
00:44:00.638,00:44:01.513,Hey.
00:44:04.933,00:44:07.019,You're not that easy to find these days.
00:44:08.062,00:44:09.563,"Well, that's the way they like it."
00:44:10.439,00:44:12.566,What with everything that's going on.
00:44:13.692,00:44:14.652,Right.
00:44:15.694,00:44:18.864,"-How are the kids? -Uh, everybody's fine."
00:44:20.407,00:44:21.367,They miss me?
00:44:23.786,00:44:24.703,I don't know.
00:44:31.752,00:44:32.961,Why are you calling?
00:44:34.880,00:44:36.048,I have good news.
00:44:37.341,00:44:41.136,We have been accepted into the 24th Colonist Group.
00:44:46.225,00:44:48.143,What's the timetable on that?
00:44:48.227,00:44:49.561,"Uh, a month."
00:44:49.645,00:44:53.399,The kids performed sensationally. You should be proud of them.
00:44:53.482,00:44:55.317,I am. I am. Of course I am.
00:44:57.236,00:45:01.323,"So, I sent you some papers and I just need you to sign them and send them back."
00:45:01.824,00:45:03.867,"So, you're finally filing for divorce?"
00:45:04.701,00:45:05.953,No. I...
00:45:07.329,00:45:09.915,That doesn't seem necessary anymore.
00:45:11.917,00:45:14.711,I need your permission so that they can go.
00:45:23.720,00:45:25.305,You wanna take my kids away from me?
00:45:26.974,00:45:28.559,"You already left, John."
00:45:28.642,00:45:34.565,"-Not for forever. -After everything that's happened, you have this one chance to do what's best for them."
00:45:36.150,00:45:37.359,Just...
00:45:38.152,00:45:40.112,sign the papers please.
00:45:41.989,00:45:43.657,This isn't about us.
00:45:55.335,00:45:56.170,Dad.
00:45:58.964,00:46:00.048,"Dad, this is Will."
00:46:00.883,00:46:02.092,Do you read me?
00:46:02.968,00:46:05.721,I'm kind of in a lot of danger here.
00:46:06.638,00:46:11.351,"Probably not as much danger as before, but definitely still in danger."
00:46:17.065,00:46:20.152,"That noise, I've heard it before."
00:46:20.235,00:46:23.906,It's coming from your ship. Isn't it?
00:46:28.619,00:46:30.787,Who knows if you can even understand me.
00:47:02.194,00:47:04.822,Guess you've never seen anything like that either.
00:47:15.165,00:47:17.543,"My name's Will Robinson, by the way."
00:47:19.878,00:47:20.712,Wait...
00:47:22.839,00:47:24.883,what's happening to your lights?
00:47:39.940,00:47:40.899,Oh...
00:47:46.113,00:47:47.155,You're dying.
00:47:48.907,00:47:50.033,Aren't you?
00:48:11.930,00:48:13.056,That feels good.
00:48:13.849,00:48:15.893,It's like my hand's been asleep for a month.
00:48:20.856,00:48:22.399,-Magnesium. -Magnesium.
00:48:23.692,00:48:25.193,-Okay. -Torch.
00:48:25.277,00:48:26.778,Close your eyes.
00:48:30.699,00:48:32.826,Okay. Okay.
00:48:54.056,00:48:55.515,It's raining.
00:48:56.099,00:48:57.184,"It's raining, Dad."
00:48:58.518,00:49:00.187,"Oh, no, no, no!"
00:49:00.270,00:49:03.065,Faster! Faster! It's filling up.
00:49:10.280,00:49:12.282,"It's... It's not raining, is it?"
00:49:18.330,00:49:19.623,Yes. It is.
00:49:29.091,00:49:30.509,"Oh, oh..."
00:49:31.218,00:49:32.511,Give me the magnesium.
00:49:42.646,00:49:43.480,Damn it!
00:49:48.860,00:49:49.945,Damn it.
00:49:56.868,00:49:59.746,She's strong. She has more time.
00:50:01.331,00:50:02.207,Dig!
00:50:03.583,00:50:05.752,Come on! Dig!
00:50:07.879,00:50:08.714,"Coming, baby!"
00:50:34.156,00:50:36.491,"Dad. Dad, come in."
00:50:38.493,00:50:42.330,"Dad, there's a fire and... and I can't get out."
00:50:46.334,00:50:48.879,"Dad. Dad, come in."
00:51:54.319,00:51:55.946,"No point in you dying, too."
00:53:27.913,00:53:28.872,Thanks.
00:54:16.586,00:54:18.588,Don't talk! Just don't talk.
00:54:18.672,00:54:19.923,Dad!
00:54:23.385,00:54:24.761,We're here.
00:54:26.721,00:54:27.973,"I'm here, baby."
00:54:39.567,00:54:40.986,It's okay. We're here.
00:54:42.696,00:54:43.738,We're here.
00:54:50.996,00:54:53.415,What's that? What is that?
00:55:09.347,00:55:10.181,It's okay.
00:55:10.265,00:55:11.891,-Will? -It's okay.
00:55:11.975,00:55:14.311,He's... He's with me.
00:55:39.169,00:55:40.170,Can you help her?
00:55:41.921,00:55:42.839,Please?
00:56:30.595,00:56:31.846,-It's okay. -Judy!
00:56:35.517,00:56:37.519,"Breathe, baby! Breathe!"
00:56:42.398,00:56:45.110,-It's okay. I got you. -Mom.
00:56:51.116,00:56:53.118,Shh. It's okay. It's okay.
00:56:53.201,00:56:55.954,Can you do something so we don't freeze?
00:57:37.662,00:57:39.956,please proceed to your assigned Jupiter pods.
00:57:40.540,00:57:42.375,Thank you for remaining calm.
00:57:45.670,00:57:47.338,It's just a temporary evacuation.
00:57:48.047,00:57:50.175,I'm sure they'll have the damage repaired soon.
00:57:52.677,00:57:54.637,It seems like an overreaction.
00:57:58.057,00:58:02.562,"The sooner we seal the breach, the sooner we can get back to bitching about being underpaid."
00:58:03.354,00:58:04.731,We're being paid a fortune.
00:58:04.814,00:58:08.193,"Ah, that was before we had a chance of being sucked out into space."
00:58:08.276,00:58:09.194,Go.
00:58:19.621,00:58:22.957,"Get down! Get down! It's coming, it's killing everybody!"
00:58:23.041,00:58:23.917,It?
00:58:43.269,00:58:44.229,Let me help you.
00:58:44.312,00:58:46.940,"-Oh, thank you. Thank you. -Here. Get your coat off."
00:58:47.732,00:58:48.566,Can you walk?
00:58:48.650,00:58:51.361,"-No, I can't walk. -Oh, I'm so sorry."
00:58:51.444,00:58:53.988,"Hey, wait. What are you doing?"
00:58:54.072,00:58:57.325,-I'm sorry. -What? What are you doing?
00:59:03.373,00:59:05.750,please proceed to your assigned Jupiter pods.
00:59:05.833,00:59:08.294,-Thank you for remaining calm. -We need to get off this ship.
00:59:12.006,00:59:13.633,The Jupiters are for families only.
00:59:18.846,00:59:19.764,Come on.
00:59:19.847,00:59:21.474,Oh. Hey.
00:59:22.058,00:59:24.644,"-You fixing this? -Yeah. Yeah, this one's yours?"
00:59:25.311,00:59:26.646,It's fixed. It's good to go.
00:59:30.275,00:59:31.109,See?
00:59:32.735,00:59:33.736,There you go.
00:59:34.946,00:59:39.576,"All Resolute colonists, please proceed to your assigned Jupiter pods."
00:59:39.659,00:59:41.202,Thank you for remaining calm.
00:59:42.245,00:59:44.289,There's always room for a mechanic or two.
00:59:45.498,00:59:46.332,Great.
00:59:47.000,00:59:48.543,What about the rest of your family?
00:59:49.752,00:59:51.754,-They won't be coming. -Oh.
00:59:52.422,00:59:53.631,"Sorry, Miss..."
00:59:54.465,00:59:55.592,Doctor.
00:59:57.051,00:59:58.678,Dr. Smith.
00:01:06.524,00:01:07.734,Right.
00:01:10.904,00:01:13.615,"Tam! Tam, are you there?"
00:01:14.449,00:01:15.867,It's just me!
00:01:17.035,00:01:18.036,Can you move?
00:01:18.745,00:01:19.954,I'm stuck.
00:01:20.038,00:01:22.665,It's the restraints. Sand's jammed them up.
00:01:32.133,00:01:35.553,"Listen to me. I need you to toss me your knife, okay?"
00:01:36.137,00:01:39.098,It's the only one we got. So don't drop it.
00:01:39.182,00:01:40.391,What happened to yours?
00:01:41.351,00:01:42.185,I dropped it.
00:01:44.103,00:01:45.480,"Okay, I'm ready."
00:01:48.441,00:01:49.734,Come on.
00:01:51.820,00:01:53.780,Okay. Toss it.
00:01:55.323,00:01:56.157,Yes!
00:01:56.741,00:02:01.579,"Lucky for you, I'm the person you'd most want to be stranded with in an emergency situation."
00:02:02.163,00:02:04.958,You know what I love about these ships when they break in half?
00:02:06.835,00:02:08.503,They spill oil everywhere.
00:02:16.678,00:02:17.804,Oh!
00:02:18.388,00:02:20.932,-It worked! I'm coming to get you. -Are you okay?
00:03:02.765,00:03:04.726,Try to climb out of here without moving.
00:03:52.941,00:03:54.150,"It's okay, Mom."
00:04:07.956,00:04:09.832,It's... It's synthetic. It's...
00:04:12.460,00:04:14.504,"It's built, not born."
00:04:14.587,00:04:18.883,"We still make the history books for first contact, even if it's a robot, right?"
00:04:18.967,00:04:22.345,We? You only get to be famous for being related to me.
00:04:27.350,00:04:28.726,Do you know where we are?
00:04:29.394,00:04:31.437,-He's not from here. -How do you know?
00:04:31.521,00:04:32.939,I saw his spaceship.
00:04:34.941,00:04:36.025,You did?
00:04:36.109,00:04:37.986,I think he crashed when we did.
00:04:39.862,00:04:42.699,-How many more of you are there? -I think he's all alone.
00:04:43.408,00:04:45.702,Or else he wouldn't have needed me to help him.
00:04:46.494,00:04:47.453,You helped it?
00:04:47.829,00:04:48.830,He was hurt.
00:04:52.000,00:04:53.501,Now it's helping you.
00:05:09.350,00:05:10.810,He's going down to the Jupiter.
00:05:14.022,00:05:17.025,I was just waiting for a break in the conversation.
00:05:17.984,00:05:20.862,Hey... how'd this happen?
00:05:22.280,00:05:26.326,"Uh, I don't know. I guess it happened when I fell."
00:05:43.634,00:05:46.179,'Cause you can fix this and get us out of here?
00:05:46.679,00:05:49.140,"Yeah, I'll let you in on a trade secret."
00:05:49.223,00:05:52.852,The answer to the question Can you fix this? is always Yes.
00:05:52.935,00:05:54.020,Even if you can't?
00:05:54.103,00:05:55.646,Especially if you can't.
00:05:55.730,00:05:57.815,Then you just add that you gotta find the right tool.
00:05:57.899,00:06:00.318,So you're gonna bullshit our way to safety.
00:06:00.401,00:06:02.904,Yep. Just need to find the right tool.
00:06:03.780,00:06:04.655,Oh.
00:06:28.638,00:06:29.514,Don't get sentimental.
00:06:29.597,00:06:32.100,I'm not carrying your bag when it gets too heavy.
00:06:35.603,00:06:37.146,"Oh, hello."
00:06:40.274,00:06:41.150,My necklace!
00:06:42.902,00:06:44.320,It must have fallen off.
00:06:45.321,00:06:46.405,You're welcome.
00:06:46.489,00:06:47.949,It's not that heavy.
00:06:53.746,00:06:54.747,Tam!
00:06:55.331,00:06:56.457,Tam!
00:06:57.583,00:06:59.669,"Doc! Doc, get over here."
00:07:04.715,00:07:06.425,I'm not that kind of doctor.
00:07:07.427,00:07:08.511,Doesn't matter.
00:07:15.893,00:07:20.440,Stealing her boots? I thought you two were friends.
00:07:29.615,00:07:32.785,Somebody ought to show some basic human decency.
00:07:32.869,00:07:34.328,"Bury her if you want, Doc."
00:07:34.412,00:07:36.831,I'm gonna try to make sure nobody has to bury us.
00:07:42.753,00:07:44.672,Hope someone's having a better day than we are.
00:08:26.297,00:08:28.758,I wish Dad would hurry up so we can get down there.
00:08:29.592,00:08:31.427,It's not so bad up here.
00:08:37.475,00:08:39.977,Let's agree that was just wind.
00:08:54.742,00:08:57.620,Lower deck water level reduced to 60%.
00:09:11.634,00:09:14.387,"Oh, come on, you stupid thing."
00:09:49.171,00:09:50.715,What the hell are you?
00:10:01.684,00:10:05.229,-Maybe we should shoot off another flare. -We already wasted one.
00:10:17.700,00:10:18.993,Wait!
00:10:20.119,00:10:23.581,-Looks like someone ejected. -Maybe they can help us.
00:10:24.165,00:10:25.166,Let's ask.
00:10:31.213,00:10:32.465,Put those on.
00:10:33.382,00:10:34.717,I'm not wearing those.
00:10:38.596,00:10:41.140,This sand... is sharp as diamonds.
00:10:41.891,00:10:43.267,Might even be diamonds.
00:10:44.977,00:10:46.562,It's gonna tear through your soles.
00:10:50.191,00:10:51.108,Thanks.
00:10:56.280,00:10:58.074,-What? -You remind me of someone.
00:10:58.574,00:10:59.617,Best lover you ever had?
00:11:02.244,00:11:03.245,My brother.
00:11:06.832,00:11:09.418,Just don't want you slowing me down. You ready?
00:11:10.836,00:11:12.254,Lead the way.
00:11:23.265,00:11:25.893,Let's go. No chicken left behind.
00:11:28.938,00:11:31.190,"If we find a cow, you carry it."
00:11:54.255,00:11:56.507,I'm gonna go get the leg brace from the printer.
00:11:56.590,00:11:57.967,"It's okay to lie down, you know."
00:11:59.510,00:12:01.220,"No, I'm fine."
00:12:11.397,00:12:13.482,The starboard side's almost finished.
00:12:14.024,00:12:15.776,"Pick up the pace, please."
00:12:33.961,00:12:35.337,Your robot's creepy.
00:12:36.338,00:12:37.548,You'll get used to him.
00:12:42.803,00:12:46.140,The hose is freezing over again. You can finish the filters later.
00:12:48.517,00:12:49.727,"Okay, Dad."
00:13:09.580,00:13:12.249,"-Oh, hey. -Hey."
00:13:12.333,00:13:14.877,"Uh, I heard it ding."
00:13:14.960,00:13:16.086,Thanks.
00:13:16.754,00:13:18.214,You had a tough day.
00:13:19.673,00:13:20.591,How you holding up?
00:13:21.926,00:13:24.136,"Yeah, I'm... I'm good."
00:13:24.720,00:13:27.223,Yeah? Okay.
00:13:38.901,00:13:39.818,Hey.
00:13:44.448,00:13:47.576,I... just...
00:13:48.744,00:13:51.080,"I just wanted to say, um..."
00:14:01.590,00:14:02.633,thank you.
00:14:33.789,00:14:36.500,This will do most of the work until your leg's healed.
00:14:38.961,00:14:40.129,Let's try it out.
00:14:52.474,00:14:54.101,Fantastic!
00:14:56.270,00:14:58.731,"Penny, why haven't you finished the filters?"
00:14:58.814,00:15:00.316,I can still smell ozone.
00:15:00.399,00:15:03.527,-Dad said I should be cleaning-- -I'd like to breathe.
00:15:18.459,00:15:21.337,But Mom said that I should fix the filters right now.
00:15:21.754,00:15:22.838,It can wait.
00:15:41.565,00:15:44.944,"Mom, Dad, you might wanna come take a look at this."
00:15:50.908,00:15:53.369,was definitely a reserve tank of another Jupiter.
00:15:54.161,00:15:55.496,Let's hope there are survivors.
00:15:56.372,00:15:57.289,Are you coming?
00:15:58.916,00:15:59.833,Are you coming?
00:16:00.501,00:16:02.211,The girls did excellent work.
00:16:04.713,00:16:10.636,"Listen, I think it's important that they all hear us speaking with one voice."
00:16:11.428,00:16:13.889,-Couldn't agree more. -That voice is mine.
00:16:16.475,00:16:17.559,Great.
00:16:34.410,00:16:35.494,It's been a while.
00:16:38.288,00:16:39.164,Yeah.
00:16:39.832,00:16:41.333,We're gonna look for survivors.
00:16:41.625,00:16:43.419,Get your gear. You're coming along.
00:16:44.753,00:16:45.713,Does Mom know?
00:16:46.797,00:16:48.465,Just get your gear.
00:16:53.637,00:16:57.224,"Girls, while your dad and I are gone, you're gonna help free the Jupiter."
00:16:57.891,00:17:01.687,"If we don't work our way out gently, we could make the ice unstable."
00:17:02.146,00:17:04.773,"Worst case scenario, the ice could crush our ship."
00:17:04.857,00:17:05.691,Understood.
00:17:05.774,00:17:11.405,"So, we'll use the maneuvering rockets, melt the ice to water, and just float up inch by inch."
00:17:11.697,00:17:12.781,Okay.
00:17:12.865,00:17:15.784,"20% power, ten minute intervals, ten second burn."
00:17:16.201,00:17:17.745,"Twenty, ten, ten."
00:17:17.828,00:17:20.956,"By this time tomorrow, our ship should be clear."
00:17:21.999,00:17:23.459,And then what?
00:17:23.542,00:17:25.252,Feet off the console.
00:17:46.190,00:17:49.693,The print model you've requested does not meet colony safety protocol.
00:17:50.069,00:17:54.698,"For assistance, dial 874628 to speak with your district representative."
00:17:56.575,00:17:59.119,"Yeah, well, I'm not at the colony, asshole."
00:18:07.711,00:18:09.797,"Okay, see if you can finish these while we're gone."
00:18:37.407,00:18:40.452,I don't wanna let it out of my sight. And you don't get one without the other.
00:18:41.620,00:18:44.289,"You see, this is one of the things we might have discussed."
00:18:44.748,00:18:45.874,We can discuss it.
00:18:47.709,00:18:51.713,No. It's fine. I'm not worried about Will.
00:18:58.137,00:18:59.471,You trust that thing?
00:19:01.431,00:19:06.228,"It brought Will back safe, saved Judy from suffocating under the ice."
00:19:06.311,00:19:08.522,It's the kind of behavior that builds trust.
00:19:09.481,00:19:10.357,Come on!
00:19:11.900,00:19:14.069,Come on. Let's go.
00:19:46.727,00:19:48.770,"Just what kind of doctor are you, anyway?"
00:19:55.402,00:19:57.738,I can't believe people pay people for that.
00:19:58.113,00:20:01.909,"Actually, they do. A lot."
00:20:04.661,00:20:07.289,to know what their deal is within five minutes of meeting them.
00:20:07.748,00:20:09.124,You think it's that easy?
00:20:11.210,00:20:12.920,"Like you, for example."
00:20:13.587,00:20:16.048,Take that necklace. That's a Saint Christopher medal.
00:20:16.131,00:20:18.217,"He's supposed to watch over you, keep you safe."
00:20:18.967,00:20:22.679,"Personally, I look out for myself. And I've never met no saint."
00:20:22.763,00:20:25.224,"But you, you're not so different."
00:20:25.641,00:20:29.269,"You're a Ph.D. or something, which makes me think you don't believe in that junk either."
00:20:29.895,00:20:31.104,Why do you wear it?
00:20:31.563,00:20:32.940,Must be another reason.
00:20:33.941,00:20:37.402,Perhaps it has something to do with that brother I remind you of.
00:20:39.529,00:20:40.906,It's none of your business.
00:20:42.366,00:20:44.159,So it is your brother.
00:20:44.243,00:20:46.036,"See, that wasn't that hard."
00:20:46.411,00:20:49.498,"And hey, I'll charge you half of what you'd charge me."
00:21:07.849,00:21:10.477,I didn't think we'd be the ones rescuing people.
00:21:11.937,00:21:13.021,We're not.
00:21:13.605,00:21:17.818,"All due respect, Angela, this is nothing personal."
00:21:25.367,00:21:26.868,You didn't check her pulse?
00:21:27.286,00:21:29.204,"Hey, you're not a real doctor either."
00:21:32.416,00:21:33.709,So now what?
00:22:14.708,00:22:16.710,"-What is that? -I know, right?"
00:22:17.127,00:22:20.172,"So familiar, but what is it? It's on the tip of your tongue."
00:22:20.255,00:22:21.673,"I'm not playing this, Penny."
00:22:21.757,00:22:24.593,"I'm sorry, Jude. That's just the way the cookie crumbles."
00:22:26.928,00:22:32.225,That's just the way the cookie crumbles. I could not have made it more obvious.
00:22:33.143,00:22:34.478,Where did you get those?
00:22:34.561,00:22:38.857,"So, you are interested in the only Oreos in a hundred trillion miles?"
00:22:38.940,00:22:42.736,You spent 14.3 ounces of your personal weight allocation on that?
00:22:42.819,00:22:44.696,No. Mom did.
00:22:44.780,00:22:46.406,It's the last item on her checklist.
00:22:46.490,00:22:49.659,Retrieve the blue object from locker 24A.
00:22:49.743,00:22:52.412,It was this or another pack of air filters. I made the call.
00:22:52.496,00:22:53.580,What are you doing?
00:22:53.872,00:22:56.875,Having it be the last item on the list indicates it's a reward for finishing.
00:22:56.958,00:23:00.212,"-No, you have to wait for everyone. -I'm going in."
00:23:06.134,00:23:07.552,Pump's clogged again.
00:23:09.888,00:23:11.223,Can we trade off?
00:23:30.534,00:23:31.910,That could have been us.
00:23:35.497,00:23:36.998,"Well, it wasn't."
00:23:54.307,00:23:58.353,"Aah, I swear to God, every time I come up here it's something worse."
00:24:01.940,00:24:04.943,"Mom, Dad, come in. Do you read me? Over."
00:24:05.444,00:24:06.820,They're out of range.
00:24:07.821,00:24:11.408,"In the valley, they're not gonna see that storm until it's directly above."
00:24:14.119,00:24:16.371,-We have to do something. -Think it through.
00:24:16.454,00:24:21.710,What pace would we need to maintain to hike down to them -and get back here in time? -Why walk when we have a Chariot?
00:24:21.793,00:24:23.587,"It's in the garage, buried under a ton of ice."
00:24:23.670,00:24:25.839,-We have to get it out! -How?
00:24:26.381,00:24:31.344,I was specifically told to go easy on the engines so the ice wouldn't become unstable and crush our ship!
00:24:31.428,00:24:35.140,"-Mom, Dad, and Will-- -Can take care of themselves."
00:24:35.682,00:24:37.517,Now stop panicking.
00:24:57.329,00:24:58.830,Penny!
00:25:19.017,00:25:23.146,-Have you lost your mind? -Somebody had to do something.
00:25:38.161,00:25:38.995,See?
00:25:46.795,00:25:48.713,Come on. You don't even have your license.
00:25:48.797,00:25:50.549,That's why you're gonna drive.
00:26:02.769,00:26:04.854,You've got to be kidding me.
00:26:06.273,00:26:07.190,"Let it go, Penny."
00:26:17.659,00:26:20.662,We're at the crash site of the Jupiter 17.
00:26:21.121,00:26:22.872,We've found no survivors.
00:26:23.498,00:26:26.960,"If there are any other search parties in the area, please respond."
00:26:29.754,00:26:31.631,-No luck? -No.
00:26:40.515,00:26:41.516,You heard that before?
00:26:43.560,00:26:44.394,Yeah.
00:26:45.020,00:26:48.440,It was coming from the crashed ship. His crashed ship.
00:26:50.358,00:26:52.861,-It must be somewhere close. -It's a long walk back.
00:26:53.903,00:26:55.905,Ask if it knows where its ship is.
00:26:59.993,00:27:01.619,Do you know where your spaceship is?
00:27:05.373,00:27:08.376,I don't think he remembers anything from before.
00:27:08.460,00:27:09.461,Before what?
00:27:10.378,00:27:13.548,"Before he got hurt. I told you, he got hurt."
00:27:13.631,00:27:14.966,But it remembers you.
00:27:15.050,00:27:17.052,So it must remember where it met you.
00:27:17.802,00:27:19.262,Let's not push our luck.
00:27:19.346,00:27:21.056,There's so much we don't know yet.
00:27:21.139,00:27:23.475,We need to take this opportunity to find out.
00:27:23.558,00:27:25.935,"When you don't know, that's when you go home."
00:27:27.437,00:27:29.439,We're heading back to the Jupiter. Come on.
00:27:29.522,00:27:31.441,"Will, since when do you not do what I ask?"
00:27:40.659,00:27:42.285,Can you take us to where we met?
00:27:47.832,00:27:49.084,"Oh, great."
00:27:49.167,00:27:50.460,Sorry.
00:27:52.670,00:27:54.381,You know you want to go as much as I do.
00:27:54.756,00:27:57.258,Not with an 11-year-old kid and a gimpy wife.
00:27:58.718,00:27:59.886,What? Gimpy?
00:28:10.688,00:28:13.233,That's probably the Jupiter where she ejected from.
00:28:13.316,00:28:15.777,Maybe there's someone there who's a little more conscious.
00:28:32.419,00:28:33.878,What do you think she weighs?
00:28:34.379,00:28:37.090,"No, there's no way I can carry her. She'll just slow us down."
00:28:38.133,00:28:41.970,That's it. That's what we're doing. We leave her.
00:28:43.722,00:28:45.432,-Are you sure? -We have no choice.
00:28:52.272,00:28:53.231,"Oh, hell."
00:29:02.365,00:29:03.366,I'm no humanitarian.
00:29:03.450,00:29:05.326,Yeah. Sure.
00:29:05.410,00:29:06.619,Think whatever you want.
00:29:07.036,00:29:09.789,You know what the bonus is for a guy like me for saving you two?
00:29:09.873,00:29:11.207,A house in Malibu.
00:29:15.587,00:29:17.505,Who's gonna pay you out here?
00:29:20.091,00:29:27.974,"You put on a good show of being completely self-interested, but I know you're a good person."
00:29:29.934,00:29:31.603,Look how you saved this chicken.
00:29:32.312,00:29:34.856,Ask the chicken if I'm a good guy come dinnertime.
00:31:11.411,00:31:12.287,Penny!
00:31:32.473,00:31:33.975,This is really not too bad.
00:31:54.871,00:31:56.039,No.
00:32:03.755,00:32:06.382,Mom? Dad? Are you there?
00:32:08.092,00:32:09.761,"Uh, yeah, this is your daughter."
00:32:09.844,00:32:13.389,The one who really doesn't want to drive the Chariot off a cliff right now.
00:32:13.473,00:32:15.850,"So if you're there, please come in."
00:32:46.005,00:32:50.176,Okay. Okay. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
00:32:51.427,00:32:54.347,Mm-hmm. Just like bumper cars.
00:32:55.682,00:32:57.392,Where everybody dies.
00:33:13.741,00:33:15.451,Maybe it's time for a flare.
00:33:37.849,00:33:39.142,There must be someone out there.
00:33:50.570,00:33:52.030,I can fix that for you.
00:33:55.450,00:33:56.743,"No, thanks."
00:33:58.578,00:34:01.748,Your brother give it to you? The one I remind you of?
00:34:04.083,00:34:05.710,I put two and two together.
00:34:12.258,00:34:13.593,It reminds me of him.
00:34:14.886,00:34:17.722,It must have been hard leaving him back on Earth.
00:34:18.848,00:34:20.224,He left first.
00:34:21.601,00:34:22.560,Car wreck.
00:34:24.353,00:34:25.646,Sorry.
00:34:27.565,00:34:28.691,Should have bought two.
00:34:30.902,00:34:32.236,Storm's getting closer.
00:34:33.404,00:34:35.156,How far can you get with her?
00:34:55.885,00:34:58.429,"In a day of firsts, this wins."
00:36:38.779,00:36:39.947,You're hovering.
00:36:48.873,00:36:50.875,Tough seed to survive that fire.
00:36:53.794,00:36:55.504,I'm gonna add it to my collection.
00:37:00.468,00:37:01.761,How'd that get in there?
00:37:08.226,00:37:09.352,Catch.
00:37:18.945,00:37:20.905,Open your hand. Hold on to it.
00:37:25.826,00:37:27.119,Throw it back.
00:37:31.582,00:37:32.541,Gently.
00:37:37.755,00:37:38.714,Nice.
00:37:42.969,00:37:46.305,This isn't weird. This isn't weird at all.
00:37:50.226,00:37:51.227,Yeah!
00:38:01.404,00:38:03.364,I always wanted him to come back.
00:38:07.076,00:38:09.954,But... now that he's here...
00:38:14.834,00:38:16.711,You probably don't know what a dad is.
00:38:38.482,00:38:39.942,Did you touch something?
00:38:40.026,00:38:42.653,-No. Did you? -No.
00:39:08.888,00:39:10.264,That's where we are.
00:39:21.734,00:39:23.152,It's a map.
00:39:45.800,00:39:48.135,I thought the Milky Way looked different from this.
00:39:49.470,00:39:50.596,It does.
00:39:52.932,00:39:54.433,So what galaxy is this?
00:40:08.197,00:40:11.617,"It's impossible, according to every law of physics."
00:40:11.700,00:40:12.660,Uh-huh.
00:40:14.829,00:40:16.664,Maybe someone wrote some new ones.
00:41:13.971,00:41:14.930,Was that you?
00:41:17.558,00:41:19.310,Why did you attack us?
00:41:20.895,00:41:22.229,Tell me!
00:41:26.942,00:41:28.277,You really don't remember?
00:41:33.991,00:41:38.287,But you're not like that anymore. You're not... You're not like that.
00:41:39.955,00:41:40.789,Are you?
00:41:50.090,00:41:51.509,Raise your left hand.
00:41:57.681,00:41:59.850,Now... Now raise your right.
00:42:07.858,00:42:09.193,Turn around.
00:42:19.703,00:42:20.829,Walk forward.
00:42:22.873,00:42:23.958,No. Wait!
00:42:25.751,00:42:27.127,Come back.
00:43:04.832,00:43:08.627,"Come on, hurry up. Get in. Get in."
00:43:23.392,00:43:24.518,My necklace.
00:43:25.394,00:43:28.397,I had it a minute ago. It must've fallen off.
00:43:46.457,00:43:47.291,Here.
00:43:49.752,00:43:51.253,You should let me fix that for you.
00:43:54.173,00:43:55.591,Fix it while I'm gone.
00:43:57.635,00:43:58.510,Gone?
00:43:59.219,00:44:03.265,"I know you won't leave her, because you're a good man."
00:44:03.349,00:44:04.683,Even if you wish you weren't.
00:44:06.560,00:44:09.229,But someone has to go out there and bring back help.
00:44:11.440,00:44:12.524,Are you sure about this?
00:44:13.692,00:44:17.488,You have one flare left. You'll know when to use it.
00:44:18.489,00:44:19.948,That's how I'll find you.
00:44:21.825,00:44:22.993,See you soon.
00:44:33.879,00:44:36.340,"If you die now, I'll be pissed."
00:44:48.936,00:44:49.895,I'm here.
00:44:50.479,00:44:52.231,-You okay? -Hey.
00:44:52.564,00:44:54.817,-Why did you run off? -I didn't run off.
00:44:58.195,00:44:59.780,We were just exploring.
00:45:01.448,00:45:05.744,"Yeah, well... that's enough exploring for today."
00:45:07.663,00:45:08.705,Come on.
00:45:22.511,00:45:26.098,"Mom... Mom, Dad, Will, do you hear me? Anybody? Over."
00:45:51.498,00:45:52.666,Cool.
00:46:03.469,00:46:06.555,"-What is that? Will, come here. -We need to get cover. Come on!"
00:46:06.638,00:46:07.848,Quick! Quick! Come on!
00:46:28.660,00:46:29.495,Damn.
00:46:42.090,00:46:43.926,-Do you hear me? -Penny?
00:46:44.259,00:46:45.511,-Mom? -Penny!
00:46:45.594,00:46:47.554,-I'm in the Chariot. Coming to get you. -What?
00:46:49.598,00:46:51.642,when you are also in the Chariot.
00:46:52.601,00:46:55.437,I can't track you because of the storm. Where are you?
00:46:55.521,00:46:56.355,Uh...
00:47:01.860,00:47:03.028,Look for the light.
00:47:03.779,00:47:04.821,The light?
00:47:05.614,00:47:08.367,Here. Put them on.
00:47:20.796,00:47:22.256,I see it. I see it. I'm coming!
00:47:27.469,00:47:29.346,"Oh, that light."
00:47:31.098,00:47:34.184,"-Look. -Go! Go, go, go! Go!"
00:47:35.727,00:47:36.728,Come on!
00:47:41.108,00:47:42.526,Not the daughter you expected?
00:47:46.572,00:47:47.531,I don't think he'll fit.
00:47:49.241,00:47:51.410,-Tell him to hold on tight. -Hold on to the back!
00:47:55.747,00:47:58.584,-Put your seat belts on. -Let's go.
00:48:19.813,00:48:22.441,Excellent. You finished the list.
00:48:33.327,00:48:36.330,"Listen, I should have, uh, been more receptive to you."
00:48:36.997,00:48:38.915,"You have the experience, the training, and I..."
00:48:41.001,00:48:42.252,I was wrong.
00:48:44.546,00:48:46.048,I'm glad you were here today.
00:48:47.674,00:48:49.051,What about tomorrow?
00:48:50.218,00:48:51.970,We'll talk about it tomorrow.
00:48:54.598,00:48:56.808,So which one of you do I need to listen to?
00:49:20.999,00:49:23.460,Angela! That's our ride!
00:49:28.215,00:49:31.802,It's the last flare we got. Give it a peck for good luck.
00:49:38.183,00:49:40.102,"Dad. Dad, look."
00:49:40.727,00:49:41.770,There's someone out there.
00:49:45.941,00:49:46.858,We can make it.
00:49:47.734,00:49:49.069,-Wha-- -Don't do the math.
00:49:57.744,00:50:01.164,we just got out of the storm and now you wanna go back in?
00:50:07.879,00:50:09.673,"There, there. I see them right there."
00:50:16.680,00:50:18.390,-Come on! -Come on!
00:50:20.892,00:50:23.186,-Run! Get in! -Hurry! Come on!
00:50:23.812,00:50:25.564,-I've got the bag. -Come on. Come on.
00:50:27.524,00:50:28.942,Is there anyone else with you?
00:50:30.318,00:50:31.194,No.
00:50:33.864,00:50:34.740,It's just me.
00:50:36.658,00:50:38.160,Go!
00:50:58.680,00:51:00.182,You have one flare left.
00:51:00.265,00:51:03.143,You'll know when to use it. See you soon.
00:51:03.977,00:51:05.562,Son of a bitch!
00:51:22.287,00:51:25.081,You're so brave. What's your name?
00:51:25.165,00:51:27.292,"I'm Penny. This is my brother, Will."
00:51:29.586,00:51:31.129,I always wanted a brother.
00:51:40.430,00:51:42.057,Come on. Come on. Come on.
00:51:53.110,00:51:54.569,"-Come on, come on! -Dad, come on!"
00:52:01.827,00:52:05.372,-Dad! Dad! Go! -Come on!
00:52:46.997,00:52:47.998,You did it.
00:52:49.374,00:52:52.586,Yeah. This is really not my thing.
00:52:53.628,00:52:56.548,"You need to get back to being you, so I can get back to being me."
00:52:56.631,00:52:58.008,-Okay? -Come here.
00:53:00.844,00:53:01.845,-Here. -Thank you.
00:53:01.928,00:53:03.889,-You're welcome. -Thank you so much.
00:53:04.764,00:53:06.224,-You okay? -I think so.
00:53:06.308,00:53:07.142,Good.
00:53:10.604,00:53:12.397,You're crushing the Oreos.
00:53:22.782,00:53:23.617,Don't worry.
00:53:24.993,00:53:26.202,He's not dangerous.
00:01:20.371,00:01:22.040,"You didn't have to, you know..."
00:01:23.500,00:01:27.504,-I know. I just thought-- -Since you were leaving.
00:01:28.546,00:01:32.425,Is it wrong to want to say goodbye to my sister?
00:01:34.761,00:01:36.805,You know I'd bring you if I could.
00:01:36.888,00:01:39.766,"Let's not ruin things with a bunch of lies, Jess."
00:01:40.016,00:01:42.143,-I'm just trying-- -To apologize?
00:01:43.394,00:01:47.315,Why would I apologize for being a productive member of society?
00:01:47.398,00:01:48.566,"Oh, there's the girl I know."
00:01:48.650,00:01:52.153,"At some point, you have to take responsibility for your choices."
00:01:52.237,00:01:55.115,Coming from someone who's never had to make any.
00:01:57.575,00:01:59.744,Your college wasn't paid for?
00:02:00.829,00:02:02.539,Dad didn't leave you the business?
00:02:02.622,00:02:04.666,What? And he should have left it to you?
00:02:05.125,00:02:06.918,"You're a criminal, June."
00:02:08.378,00:02:09.629,I've made mistakes.
00:02:09.712,00:02:12.048,And I'm glad you recognize that.
00:02:13.383,00:02:18.138,But they don't want mistakes in the new world.
00:02:18.221,00:02:20.306,"Well, thanks for the meal. Have a nice flight."
00:02:20.390,00:02:21.558,Oh. Wait.
00:02:23.017,00:02:28.314,I didn't ask you here to fight. I just... I just wanted to give you these.
00:02:29.816,00:02:32.819,My house. My car.
00:02:34.154,00:02:35.738,"I'm not gonna need them anymore, so..."
00:02:36.156,00:02:37.657,I don't deserve this.
00:02:37.740,00:02:40.827,"No, no. Start fresh."
00:02:41.578,00:02:44.622,Be a better version of yourself.
00:02:50.211,00:02:51.045,Yes.
00:02:51.129,00:02:52.463,I could drive your car?
00:02:55.216,00:02:57.719,-Wear your clothes? -If you'd like.
00:03:00.013,00:03:04.267,So I could just... I could just be you?
00:04:59.424,00:05:02.593,I was looking at it... I was looking for anything to orient us.
00:05:02.969,00:05:06.347,"Anything familiar, a planet or a constellation."
00:05:07.140,00:05:10.935,"But there was nothing, nothing-- There was nothing I recognized at all."
00:05:12.895,00:05:15.148,Exactly how lost are we talking about?
00:05:15.440,00:05:17.567,"Yeah, Can't find your car in the parking lot lost?"
00:05:17.650,00:05:29.037,"Well, if this is Earth and this is Alpha Centauri, we are, metaphorically, maybe, a 600-year drive away."
00:05:29.746,00:05:30.580,Maybe.
00:05:31.664,00:05:34.000,"Okay, so, not metaphorically..."
00:05:34.292,00:05:36.836,"Trillions of light years. It's, uh..."
00:05:38.963,00:05:41.049,"Look, if we got here, we can get back."
00:05:42.383,00:05:45.678,So... how do we get back?
00:05:49.640,00:05:54.228,"Honestly, unless the Resolute is intact and can find us, we might be stuck here."
00:05:57.607,00:06:01.069,Which is why I need everyone working on the problem.
00:06:02.361,00:06:03.905,We need to get comms operational.
00:06:03.988,00:06:05.990,Can't do that until we get the ship out of the ice.
00:06:06.074,00:06:07.533,"-Judy, you need to get-- -Maureen."
00:06:07.617,00:06:08.576,What?
00:06:14.040,00:06:18.086,and I think we'd all think a lot clearer after some rest.
00:06:21.255,00:06:24.550,-I am kind of tired. -Yeah. I think we all are.
00:06:28.846,00:06:31.891,"Just an hour, Mom. Then I'll be ready."
00:06:32.600,00:06:33.726,Okay.
00:06:35.061,00:06:38.981,Okay. I will wake everybody up after the storm.
00:06:39.065,00:06:40.108,"Thanks, Mom."
00:07:00.586,00:07:03.548,"-Oh, no, Doctor, don't. I've got it. -Oh, please. Let me."
00:07:04.549,00:07:05.800,Thank you.
00:07:08.678,00:07:10.471,"Um, your family..."
00:07:17.895,00:07:18.771,Oh.
00:07:19.313,00:07:20.606,"No, it's okay."
00:07:21.441,00:07:25.027,"No husband, no kids. Makes it a little easier."
00:07:26.779,00:07:28.364,You're welcome to stay with us until...
00:07:32.952,00:07:35.663,Let me show you where you can store your stuff.
00:07:38.082,00:07:40.751,"Doctor, engineer, soldier."
00:07:41.711,00:07:44.422,Sounds like I was rescued by the right family.
00:07:45.089,00:07:46.924,I wouldn't say we're...
00:07:48.217,00:07:50.428,-It's complicated. -Most families are.
00:07:52.763,00:07:54.849,-I'm a psychologist. -Oh.
00:07:54.974,00:07:57.560,I actually specialize in family therapy.
00:07:58.603,00:07:59.812,You've come to the right place.
00:07:59.896,00:08:03.858,"Seriously, if there's anything I could do to repay you somehow..."
00:08:03.941,00:08:06.027,"Don't worry, we'll put you to work."
00:08:06.694,00:08:09.405,"Um, so, you can store your stuff in there."
00:08:09.572,00:08:13.659,"I'm sorry we don't have extra bunks, but there's, uh, blankets."
00:08:13.743,00:08:14.869,Please. I'll manage.
00:08:14.952,00:08:17.079,Okay. See you in a bit.
00:08:17.163,00:08:18.831,See you. Good night.
00:09:09.465,00:09:11.133,I thought you needed the rest.
00:09:22.019,00:09:23.604,"Hey, hon. Look..."
00:09:24.355,00:09:27.775,what you went through out there in the ice...
00:09:28.359,00:09:30.361,I know what that kind of fear can do to your body.
00:09:30.444,00:09:33.406,"More importantly, what it can do to your mind."
00:09:35.950,00:09:36.909,"I'm fine, Dad."
00:09:43.874,00:09:44.750,Okay.
00:09:46.294,00:09:47.670,You do what you have to do.
00:12:27.872,00:12:28.998,You okay?
00:12:33.461,00:12:34.336,Bad dream?
00:12:39.633,00:12:44.388,"Don't tell anyone, but I still get them from time to time."
00:12:45.723,00:12:50.895,"And when I do, it helps to say what they were out loud."
00:12:57.693,00:13:01.113,It was nothing. Really. I'm fine.
00:13:22.760,00:13:23.886,I'm gonna go back to bed.
00:13:25.346,00:13:26.222,Sorry.
00:13:29.600,00:13:32.311,Please don't mention anything to my dad.
00:13:32.394,00:13:33.687,-Oh. -About my nightmare.
00:13:34.355,00:13:36.440,I'm good at keeping secrets.
00:13:57.836,00:13:59.880,It's the glacier. It's breaking apart.
00:13:59.964,00:14:01.924,-When the girls used the blast jets-- -Wasn't me.
00:14:02.007,00:14:04.218,Yeah. It wasn't her who totally saved everybody's life.
00:14:05.219,00:14:09.306,"If we don't get the Jupiter out of here, the whole thing's gonna collapse on us."
00:14:11.892,00:14:13.978,The storm's over. It's all clear up there.
00:14:14.061,00:14:17.231,"Okay. Judy, pre-flight checklist. Start with the thrusters."
00:14:17.314,00:14:20.067,"Penny, as we get closer to the surface, I want you on the radio."
00:14:20.150,00:14:25.865,"Soon as we get the signal, we broadcast. See if the Resolute-- We got a problem with the engines."
00:14:26.657,00:14:27.575,What kind of problem?
00:14:28.325,00:14:29.577,We don't have any.
00:14:41.297,00:14:44.383,It's blocking the air flow to the ventilation shafts.
00:14:49.471,00:14:52.016,We're not going anywhere until we clear this out.
00:14:54.768,00:14:58.606,"-I'll get Judy to come down and start-- -Wait, you think she's ready?"
00:14:58.689,00:14:59.899,"What do you mean, ready?"
00:14:59.982,00:15:02.401,"After what happened, you're not worried about her?"
00:15:02.484,00:15:04.820,"I'm worried about a lot of things, Judy's not one of them."
00:15:04.904,00:15:06.363,She'll pull through. She always does.
00:15:06.447,00:15:09.909,"Well, maybe she'll pull through faster if we let her sit this out."
00:15:10.451,00:15:17.082,"You know, give her time-- We don't have time, John. This part of the glacier is-- Unstable. Yeah, I know."
00:15:18.042,00:15:18.959,So is our daughter.
00:15:19.627,00:15:23.213,You really think you're the best judge of what she can and can't handle?
00:15:25.466,00:15:29.803,"Look, I know you and the kids are this team, but..."
00:15:41.023,00:15:43.609,All right. Um...
00:15:44.652,00:15:47.988,Then how do you think we should handle our new guest?
00:15:48.072,00:15:55.371,"Well, it seems to want to help us, but we don't know why it's here, or what-- I meant Dr. Smith."
00:15:55.746,00:15:58.540,"Oh. Yeah, right. Um..."
00:16:00.167,00:16:07.216,"Well, if she qualified for Alpha Centauri, she must be trained in emergency procedures, so she should be fine."
00:16:10.344,00:16:13.055,"Okay, aft engine cage."
00:16:13.138,00:16:15.641,We need to disassemble the contaminated thrusters.
00:16:15.724,00:16:18.811,So bag and heat-seal anything that needs to be on VC levels.
00:16:19.687,00:16:21.605,-Are you okay? -Yeah. Sure.
00:16:22.606,00:16:25.943,"How about you and I work together? Okay, everybody else pair up."
00:16:26.026,00:16:27.778,-Dibs on Will. -Seriously?
00:16:27.861,00:16:31.031,I want to spend quality time with my brother. What's wrong with that?
00:16:32.533,00:16:36.120,Every piece needs to be wiped completely clear before it goes into the cage.
00:16:36.203,00:16:37.579,Guess you're with me.
00:16:38.288,00:16:42.626,"Hey, you two, flush out the combustion chamber so we don't re-circ any contaminants into the system."
00:16:45.504,00:16:47.923,"Uh, John, does that sound okay?"
00:16:48.507,00:16:50.884,Sure. Let's get this done.
00:16:54.471,00:16:56.473,Um... Okay.
00:16:57.057,00:16:59.518,"Your robot's totally gonna do the work for us, right?"
00:17:56.909,00:17:57.743,Is it safe?
00:17:59.328,00:18:02.247,I think that's the first time I've ever heard you ask that.
00:18:04.124,00:18:06.960,"Well, you haven't been around to hear much of anything, so..."
00:18:12.049,00:18:13.675,"Hey, Jude?"
00:18:15.427,00:18:17.221,It's okay if you don't want to come down here.
00:18:18.847,00:18:21.391,Mom always says four hands are better than two.
00:18:21.475,00:18:24.853,Doesn't she also say too many cooks spoil the broth?
00:18:26.438,00:18:28.023,Not one time.
00:18:32.611,00:18:33.987,Speaking of which...
00:18:55.968,00:18:58.137,Hey. Everything okay?
00:18:58.220,00:18:59.721,Did you use the printer today?
00:19:00.139,00:19:01.557,No. Why?
00:19:02.266,00:19:05.102,A record came up. Someone ran a program outside protocol.
00:19:05.185,00:19:07.855,Oh. So you automatically assume it was me?
00:19:08.272,00:19:10.524,Not assuming. I'm asking.
00:19:14.153,00:19:16.738,"Okay, I did think about it, but it wouldn't let me."
00:19:17.197,00:19:18.490,"Jesus, John."
00:19:18.574,00:19:21.869,This isn't your commune on Alpha Centauri. We need protection.
00:19:21.952,00:19:24.121,You know how I feel about weapons in our house.
00:19:24.204,00:19:25.956,"We already have one, Maureen."
00:19:26.039,00:19:28.792,It belongs to an 11-year-old boy and we have no idea how to use it.
00:19:31.295,00:19:33.755,"After everything that's happened, I'm relieved."
00:19:33.839,00:19:35.757,It's one less thing we have to worry about.
00:19:37.676,00:19:40.220,"More importantly, if you didn't print something, who did?"
00:19:45.726,00:19:49.771,"We can skip the heat exchanger, but let's pull the rotary coupling and the igniter."
00:19:55.527,00:19:57.654,I have to be honest with you about something.
00:19:57.738,00:20:00.699,"And if it makes you regret taking me in, I wouldn't blame you."
00:20:02.576,00:20:04.578,I was actually gonna ask you.
00:20:04.912,00:20:06.955,How did you get past the restrictions?
00:20:08.290,00:20:09.333,What do you mean?
00:20:10.459,00:20:16.298,On the printer. There's a firewall so people can't-- I think our signals are crossed. I haven't touched your printer.
00:20:18.508,00:20:19.384,Oh.
00:20:20.385,00:20:21.428,Sorry.
00:20:22.471,00:20:25.724,"-What was it you wanted to ask? -It's just that, uh..."
00:20:31.980,00:20:39.196,"Most of my prep-grouping was occupational and not familial, and most of them were more mechanically inclined, so I figured they would..."
00:20:44.576,00:20:46.536,I really should've paid more attention.
00:20:48.121,00:20:53.961,"I just never imagined we'd end up-- Hey, it's okay. Nobody did."
00:20:56.922,00:21:00.509,Really? You seem like you've been preparing for this since you were a child.
00:21:00.592,00:21:02.511,Might explain why I didn't have a lot of friends.
00:21:07.182,00:21:11.228,"Successful, intelligent, beautiful."
00:21:13.605,00:21:15.774,You remind me of my sister.
00:21:19.903,00:21:21.947,I didn't have any siblings.
00:21:22.406,00:21:23.657,It would've been nice.
00:21:23.740,00:21:26.410,"Someone to help with the chores, work the fields."
00:21:26.493,00:21:30.622,Work the fields? Am I standing next to a genuine farm girl?
00:21:31.623,00:21:33.417,-In the flesh. -Oh.
00:21:34.126,00:21:37.963,Not a lot of farm girls grow up to be aerospace engineers.
00:21:48.473,00:21:49.975,What the hell is that?
00:21:56.565,00:21:58.984,which is weird 'cause we're not using any.
00:22:02.154,00:22:03.697,Damage from the ice could've caused a leak.
00:22:03.780,00:22:05.324,I'll go check it out.
00:22:05.407,00:22:07.951,"Keep an eye on the fuel. If it drops any faster, radio me, okay?"
00:22:11.913,00:22:12.831,"Me, too."
00:23:20.607,00:23:22.401,Your mom said you'd know what to do with this?
00:23:22.484,00:23:25.195,"Uh, yeah, that's fine. Just leave it there. Thank you."
00:23:30.951,00:23:32.619,What do you think about her?
00:23:33.328,00:23:36.039,Dr. Smith? I don't know.
00:23:37.916,00:23:40.919,-I don't know. I like her hair. -That's how you form your opinion?
00:23:41.002,00:23:42.879,What about judging a book by its cover?
00:23:42.963,00:23:44.923,Whoever said that has never been to a bookstore.
00:23:45.257,00:23:48.760,You've never been to a bookstore. The last one closed in-- That's not my point.
00:23:55.809,00:23:57.144,"Hey, come back."
00:23:57.561,00:24:00.105,These parts aren't gonna clean themselves.
00:24:01.523,00:24:03.900,"Yeah, thank you. Cool robot, Will."
00:24:20.250,00:24:23.712,"Well, if there is a fuel leak, it's not wide scale."
00:24:24.796,00:24:26.631,I'm gonna take a closer look.
00:24:49.738,00:24:52.532,"Thanks. So, new development."
00:24:53.116,00:24:56.119,"Somewhere along the line, we started bleeding fuel."
00:25:03.293,00:25:05.503,How much longer do you think we have?
00:25:05.587,00:25:08.632,Until we run out of fuel or until the glacier crushes us?
00:25:08.715,00:25:13.720,"Seriously, why don't we all pile into that Chariot and get the hell out of here before it's too late?"
00:25:13.803,00:25:15.013,Not a chance.
00:25:15.513,00:25:25.232,"Maybe one or two people could survive in there for a bit, I'm gonna take these to the kids and see how they're doing on those parts."
00:25:54.177,00:25:55.303,Come on.
00:25:56.012,00:25:57.847,I thought you were supposed to listen to me.
00:26:32.173,00:26:33.508,-Where's Will? -I don't know.
00:26:35.593,00:26:37.095,What kind of danger?
00:26:37.721,00:26:40.265,"-Mom, be careful! -Why? What happened?"
00:26:40.348,00:26:41.850,There's something on the ship.
00:26:55.572,00:26:56.406,Dad?
00:27:03.204,00:27:04.039,Dad?
00:27:09.502,00:27:10.337,John?
00:27:11.963,00:27:13.340,Joh-- Where's your father?
00:27:13.423,00:27:16.259,I... I think he's still in the basement. Why? What's wrong?
00:27:16.343,00:27:19.429,Will said there's something on board. Some kind of-- Some kind of what?
00:27:19.512,00:27:29.814,"Judy, you go find Dr. Smith. Penny, you stay here and-- Don't go downstairs."
00:27:37.405,00:27:39.908,-What is it? -And why does it smell so bad?
00:27:39.991,00:27:43.662,"No idea, but it probably came in through one of the puncture holes from the crash."
00:27:43.745,00:27:45.955,-Think it's been hiding the whole time? -Yeah.
00:27:46.039,00:27:48.541,Smells like it's been hiding in someone's butthole.
00:27:52.337,00:27:54.297,I've never seen anything like it.
00:28:02.680,00:28:04.891,"Wait, where's Will?"
00:28:04.974,00:28:07.852,It's okay. He's safe. The robot locked him in the closet.
00:28:08.269,00:28:09.270,Okay.
00:28:10.271,00:28:12.440,-Why? -Why does he do anything?
00:28:13.942,00:28:15.944,I think that smell is fuel.
00:28:16.027,00:28:18.738,Makes sense. I found it in the water next to the tank.
00:28:22.075,00:28:23.785,Fuel's dropping. Faster now.
00:28:37.257,00:28:40.677,And I'm never having unagi again.
00:28:44.013,00:28:46.933,Our fuel isn't leaking. It's being eaten.
00:28:47.976,00:28:49.936,Our fuel is a methane hybrid.
00:28:50.895,00:28:54.482,One of the compounds must be similar to its food source on the planet.
00:28:54.816,00:28:56.943,Any ideas how we get out of this one?
00:28:58.403,00:28:59.988,I need a bigger whiteboard.
00:29:01.030,00:29:02.532,Are those our fuel tanks?
00:29:02.615,00:29:04.701,Is anyone else never sleeping in here again?
00:29:05.785,00:29:06.828,Is it just me?
00:29:06.911,00:29:13.001,"The Jupiters were built with two fuel tanks: the primary and the reserve. So far, our reserves are untouched."
00:29:13.501,00:29:16.171,"If it stays that way, we'll have enough to get out of the ice."
00:29:16.254,00:29:19.048,So we need to trap those things and keep 'em out of the other tank.
00:29:19.132,00:29:27.807,"Yes, but the emergency settings will open the reserve tank when the primary gets too low, and the only way to stop that is to turn it off manually at the source."
00:29:29.768,00:29:33.021,"So, um, we have to go down where the eels are?"
00:29:33.104,00:29:37.317,"At the rate these things are going, we have about 15 minutes before we're dry."
00:29:37.901,00:29:39.152,I'll handle the tank.
00:29:40.445,00:29:42.113,You just get us ready to fly.
00:29:50.121,00:29:51.456,"Hey, Dad?"
00:29:52.665,00:29:53.958,-Yeah? -I can help.
00:29:54.751,00:29:56.878,"Oh, it's okay. You sit this one out."
00:29:56.961,00:29:59.964,"No, seriously, I'm... I can handle it."
00:30:00.048,00:30:02.342,"I believe you, I do."
00:30:04.969,00:30:06.429,"I want you to believe it, too."
00:30:22.237,00:30:23.530,I need to get in there.
00:30:26.157,00:30:31.412,I know it's dangerous. It's gonna get a lot more dangerous if I can't get in there to get a torque wrench.
00:30:37.293,00:30:41.256,"Will, can you tell your robot to open the damn door?"
00:30:41.339,00:30:43.174,I've been trying. He won't listen.
00:30:51.891,00:30:55.687,"Judy, I need you to print me a torque wrench, 11/16."
00:30:59.691,00:31:04.404,-Mom said we've only got-- -I know. Can you just do the best you can?
00:31:10.451,00:31:12.245,I'm gonna buy us some more time.
00:31:20.003,00:31:21.546,I don't understand.
00:31:21.629,00:31:24.507,It's okay. It's not your fault.
00:31:24.924,00:31:27.051,He usually does what I want him to do.
00:31:31.472,00:31:32.390,Really?
00:31:33.975,00:31:35.518,Why do you think that is?
00:31:35.602,00:31:39.606,I don't know. Maybe it's his way of saying thank you.
00:31:41.190,00:31:42.108,For what?
00:31:43.693,00:31:44.736,For saving his life.
00:31:48.531,00:31:50.533,And now it's like we're connected.
00:31:51.242,00:31:54.537,Like he just knows what I want him to do.
00:31:55.997,00:31:57.290,Until now.
00:32:10.053,00:32:13.681,Maybe he's not listening to your voice...
00:32:15.767,00:32:19.854,because he's listening to what's inside.
00:32:21.189,00:32:22.440,What do you mean?
00:32:25.276,00:32:36.329,"Every day, we have these little battles going on inside of us, between what we want to do..."
00:32:38.081,00:32:40.541,and what we need to do. And...
00:32:43.711,00:32:46.172,sometimes they can be very different things.
00:33:04.232,00:33:08.444,Level three access confirmed. Level three access confirmed.
00:33:08.528,00:33:09.529,Morning.
00:33:16.494,00:33:18.246,Level three access confirmed.
00:33:24.002,00:33:26.462,Level three access confirmed.
00:33:27.588,00:33:28.798,"Excuse me, miss?"
00:33:32.385,00:33:35.096,"Hey, Jessica Harris, I've been looking for you."
00:33:37.223,00:33:39.809,"Hey, come on, why aren't you stopping?"
00:33:40.977,00:33:42.395,"I'm sorry, I..."
00:33:42.478,00:33:44.105,"No, I'm sorry."
00:33:44.188,00:33:46.524,I just haven't been able to get away from Holly lately.
00:33:46.607,00:33:49.110,"At this point, I don't even care if she finds out."
00:33:50.111,00:33:51.487,I just need to be with you.
00:33:59.412,00:34:02.123,"Jesus, Jess. I thought you'd been avoiding me."
00:34:02.206,00:34:04.876,-Can we go somewhere? -I don't want anyone to see us.
00:34:06.627,00:34:07.795,Wait a minute.
00:34:10.757,00:34:12.842,-Who the hell are you? -Let's make a deal.
00:34:14.343,00:34:18.931,"You don't tell anyone about me, and I won't tell your wife about your bad taste in women."
00:34:34.072,00:34:35.698,"-Nine, eight... -Press the button."
00:34:35.782,00:34:40.870,"-You don't want to do this to me. -...seven, six, -five, four, three... -Just press the override button."
00:34:40.953,00:34:42.872,"-...two, one. -Please, override it!"
00:35:12.610,00:35:15.655,Clever. Sixth grade biology?
00:35:17.657,00:35:19.408,It was actually Jimmy Sewerth's backyard.
00:35:19.492,00:35:25.498,You told me I couldn't play with him because anyone who tortures worms is destined to be a future serial killer.
00:35:25.581,00:35:28.417,"Right. Well, Jimmy's not going to Alpha Centauri, is he?"
00:35:31.921,00:35:36.342,Your dad thinks I expect too much of you kids sometimes. Do you?
00:35:38.136,00:35:40.304,Um... no.
00:35:43.349,00:35:47.395,"I just think maybe, sometimes, you expect too little from Dad."
00:35:52.733,00:35:54.819,"Every time you ask, it goes faster."
00:35:58.406,00:35:59.323,Are you okay?
00:36:15.006,00:36:16.007,"Hey, Maureen."
00:36:16.090,00:36:17.800,How are the engines coming along?
00:36:20.261,00:36:22.180,"-One down, one to go. -Great."
00:36:25.558,00:36:27.768,I think some of these pieces are still back in the hub.
00:36:27.852,00:36:30.646,-Do you want me to get them? -Yeah. But be careful.
00:36:31.230,00:36:32.315,Mmm-hmm.
00:36:34.650,00:36:36.444,What... What are you doing?
00:36:37.153,00:36:38.571,I'm being careful.
00:37:28.371,00:37:30.414,-Hey! You okay? -Yeah. You?
00:37:36.712,00:37:37.588,Yeah.
00:37:39.715,00:37:41.217,"But the torque wrench, it didn't print."
00:37:44.095,00:37:46.722,"-John... -Judy, hold a sec."
00:37:47.473,00:37:53.187,"When the Jupiter's weight shifted, it must've exposed the fuel sensor and released the reserves into the main tank."
00:37:57.733,00:37:59.610,We can't wait. We gotta launch right now.
00:37:59.694,00:38:02.113,The last thruster's almost done. I just have to secure it.
00:38:02.196,00:38:03.739,"-So... -Five minutes, tops."
00:38:05.950,00:38:06.784,Penny?
00:38:09.328,00:38:17.003,"Whatever it is, I'm sure your family will-- Why won't you listen to me?"
00:38:18.087,00:38:21.048,"Please, help them."
00:38:23.634,00:38:26.595,I don't understand. Why won't he listen to me?
00:38:26.679,00:38:28.180,Shh. Deep breaths.
00:38:28.764,00:38:30.433,"Fear is a powerful emotion, Will."
00:38:31.726,00:38:35.688,"If you and that machine are as connected as you say, he can sense that fear in you."
00:38:37.648,00:38:38.649,It's okay to be afraid.
00:38:39.900,00:38:41.402,To want to save yourself.
00:38:43.029,00:38:45.656,"No, it's not."
00:38:46.282,00:38:49.160,Self-preservation is nothing to be ashamed of.
00:38:50.119,00:38:51.829,It's how we learn to survive.
00:39:00.129,00:39:01.130,Help.
00:39:06.344,00:39:07.428,Dad!
00:39:08.304,00:39:09.221,Dad.
00:39:12.266,00:39:13.768,"Hey, sweetie. You okay?"
00:39:13.851,00:39:14.685,Been better.
00:39:14.769,00:39:16.979,"Yeah, that's going around."
00:39:17.063,00:39:19.440,They're all around me. I can't move.
00:39:21.525,00:39:23.694,-Hey! Hey! -No!
00:39:23.778,00:39:24.695,It's on my leg!
00:39:29.867,00:39:32.870,"They're not after you, they're after the fuel."
00:39:32.953,00:39:35.081,But the fuel is... It's all over me!
00:39:36.415,00:39:39.126,"Sweetie, it's gonna be okay."
00:39:41.337,00:39:42.963,Daddy?
00:39:44.507,00:39:47.385,"-Daddy? Daddy, no! -Go! Go!"
00:39:48.969,00:39:52.681,Go to the hub. Come on! Come on!
00:39:59.980,00:40:02.274,-Are you sure? -'Course I'm sure.
00:40:03.192,00:40:06.612,"You and me, we're survivors, aren't we?"
00:40:14.620,00:40:18.457,"Your family, they risked their lives out there in the storm to save me."
00:40:19.625,00:40:22.002,So I think it's time I risked my life to save them.
00:40:22.086,00:40:25.798,I don't understand. We're in here. How are you gonna get out there?
00:40:25.881,00:40:30.094,Your robot! Think about it. He only cares about putting you in danger.
00:40:30.177,00:40:31.971,He could care less what happens to me.
00:40:32.054,00:40:33.764,But I care what happens to you.
00:40:43.941,00:40:46.694,"I appreciate that, Will. I really do."
00:40:47.653,00:40:51.323,But one thing you'll learn about me... I can handle myself.
00:40:54.493,00:40:57.496,"Come on, tell him."
00:40:59.290,00:41:01.542,"Robot, I'm gonna need you to listen."
00:41:30.404,00:41:31.238,Okay.
00:41:58.766,00:42:01.185,Okay! Okay!
00:42:37.096,00:42:41.308,Warning. Fuel level at 25%. No reserves.
00:42:47.022,00:42:51.986,This operation will compromise the structural integrity of your residential transport vehicle.
00:42:52.486,00:42:55.197,Further aerial navigation will be eliminated.
00:42:56.156,00:43:01.161,"29, 28, 27, 26..."
00:43:07.209,00:43:08.335,"Oh, come on."
00:43:15.467,00:43:16.427,"Oh, no."
00:43:17.720,00:43:19.054,Come on!
00:43:23.684,00:43:25.144,Oh! Come on!
00:43:33.611,00:43:34.945,"Oh, thank you."
00:43:36.864,00:43:38.198,"Okay, okay."
00:43:38.282,00:43:40.618,We're good. Let's go.
00:43:41.493,00:43:42.661,You look terrible.
00:43:42.745,00:43:44.038,"Thanks. You, too."
00:43:45.372,00:43:46.206,Okay.
00:43:47.541,00:43:50.836,-Where the heck have you been? -Figuring out how to save your ass.
00:43:56.342,00:43:58.552,That's okay. 15% should be enough to get us out.
00:43:58.636,00:44:02.348,-But what about those things? -They should just burn up on ignition.
00:44:03.182,00:44:04.600,Everyone hold tight.
00:44:17.655,00:44:19.281,-No reserves. -Everything checks out.
00:44:25.329,00:44:27.122,-Dump the fuel. -What?
00:44:27.206,00:44:37.758,"-Dump the fuel. -We can't, we need-- If those things are still in the tank, they might be clogging the intake valve, which means whatever fuel is left down there can't get into the combustion chamber."
00:44:37.841,00:44:40.219,Ever drink fresh lemonade and get a seed stuck in your straw?
00:44:47.393,00:44:50.229,There's still enough fuel in the lines to get us out.
00:44:51.814,00:44:52.898,Do it.
00:45:04.201,00:45:06.662,"Maureen, does this thing run on fumes?"
00:45:07.746,00:45:09.123,I sure as hell hope so.
00:46:26.033,00:46:28.535,"-John... -It's okay, I got this."
00:46:35.042,00:46:36.335,John?
00:46:53.560,00:46:56.939,Does anybody have a mop? I may have barfed a little.
00:47:09.576,00:47:11.537,Nice bit of flying you did.
00:47:12.746,00:47:14.039,It's a good crew.
00:47:48.699,00:47:49.825,Will?
00:47:53.620,00:47:54.621,Mom!
00:48:02.212,00:48:04.381,I'm so sorry I wasn't there to help.
00:48:05.257,00:48:06.550,"It's okay, sweetie."
00:48:07.134,00:48:08.969,You would've if you could've.
00:48:46.089,00:48:49.718,"We've taken on heavy damage, but are still operational."
00:48:50.302,00:48:53.055,Life support systems have been stabilized.
00:48:53.138,00:48:55.641,Navigational capabilities are being assessed.
00:48:55.724,00:48:57.935,Wounded are being tended to.
00:48:58.685,00:49:07.361,"Most importantly, we believe, in time, we'll be able to get back on course Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
00:49:13.909,00:49:15.369,"I know, baby."
00:49:20.290,00:49:25.170,"know that as soon as repairs are completed, we will find you."
00:49:29.257,00:49:35.931,Did you really think we wouldn't find you? Do you think you're the first person who thought they could fake their way into a new life?
00:49:36.807,00:49:39.434,June Harris. Quite a career.
00:49:39.810,00:49:43.230,Breaking and entering. Possession of stolen goods.
00:49:43.313,00:49:44.481,Identity theft.
00:49:44.564,00:49:48.151,Now it seems you've graduated to the big time.
00:49:48.235,00:49:53.490,We have you on camera taking that man's life.
00:49:53.573,00:49:57.494,I was defending myself. It wasn't my fault.
00:49:57.577,00:49:59.579,"You don't actually believe that, do you?"
00:50:00.789,00:50:05.001,"Well, Miss Harris, I have some good news and some bad news."
00:50:05.627,00:50:09.715,"The good news, we haven't set up a system of justice yet."
00:50:10.173,00:50:12.300,No courts. No jail.
00:50:13.009,00:50:14.302,Bad news?
00:50:14.720,00:50:20.600,"We haven't set up a system of justice yet, which means I can do whatever the hell I want to you."
00:50:25.439,00:50:27.899,I don't know. They're asking for you in the control room.
00:50:30.193,00:50:33.321,Sit tight. We are not done. Not even close.
00:51:46.353,00:51:47.437,What is it?
00:51:56.780,00:51:57.656,I don't want it.
00:52:01.326,00:52:04.663,Wait. Did you make it?
00:52:05.705,00:52:07.374,With our printer?
00:52:08.834,00:52:09.668,Why?
00:52:12.671,00:52:14.798,Danger? From what?
00:52:18.426,00:52:19.845,That was just a bad dream.
00:52:20.887,00:52:24.474,Look... I know you don't want to hurt me...
00:52:26.810,00:52:30.355,"but if we're gonna be friends, you can't hurt anybody."
00:52:31.356,00:52:32.399,Ever.
00:52:34.192,00:52:35.360,Do you understand?
00:52:39.656,00:52:40.657,Good.
00:06:57.834,00:06:59.460,I see.
00:07:00.169,00:07:01.170,Astounding.
00:07:02.547,00:07:03.923,How strange it is.
00:07:04.006,00:07:05.716,No. How familiar.
00:07:05.800,00:07:08.845,It moved with muscular contraction. It ate.
00:07:10.513,00:07:13.266,It evidenced both a fear and a pleasure reflex.
00:07:15.518,00:07:18.229,The universe is a big place.
00:07:19.105,00:07:21.149,I imagine things get far stranger than that.
00:07:33.077,00:07:34.620,They've arrived.
00:07:36.873,00:07:37.957,I'm so glad.
00:00:26.568,00:00:27.736,"You, uh, want some help?"
00:00:32.198,00:00:33.408,Seriously.
00:00:34.951,00:00:36.286,Let him help.
00:00:56.848,00:00:59.434,"-So, what are these for? -It's a perimeter fence."
00:00:59.934,00:01:02.896,"Like we had back at home when things got, uh..."
00:01:02.979,00:01:06.274,Except this one's not meant to keep out people.
00:01:10.570,00:01:14.365,"So, uh, your mom and I, we're gonna be heading out."
00:01:15.950,00:01:20.580,We're gonna check whether anyone else has had better luck contacting the Resolute than we have.
00:01:21.456,00:01:23.333,This will keep you safe while we're gone.
00:01:23.750,00:01:26.503,We're already safe. We've got him.
00:01:29.255,00:01:30.423,Maybe.
00:01:36.179,00:01:40.058,"We don't know anything about Dr. Smith, but you're not worried about her."
00:01:40.141,00:01:41.726,"Yeah, well, that's different."
00:01:41.810,00:01:42.727,Why?
00:01:43.186,00:01:46.981,"Well, she can't hammer metal stakes into the ground like they're toothpicks."
00:01:52.403,00:01:54.948,"Let's talk about this later, hmm?"
00:01:57.033,00:02:01.121,Why don't you and your sisters start the Jupiter expansion protocols?
00:02:01.913,00:02:03.790,Looks like we might be here for a while.
00:02:36.114,00:02:38.158,Welcome to your new life.
00:02:38.950,00:02:44.247,It's been a long journey for you. Almost 26 trillion miles.
00:02:44.330,00:02:45.790,But you are home now.
00:02:46.040,00:02:47.834,-You've joined a community... -I like it here.
00:02:47.917,00:02:49.502,...of the best and brightest...
00:02:49.586,00:02:52.213,Look at these people. Everyone's abs are so well-defined.
00:02:52.297,00:02:56.968,...dedicated to building a society that will last generations to come.
00:02:59.888,00:03:01.764,Please begin expansion now.
00:03:05.018,00:03:07.562,"Okay, let's get this over with."
00:03:11.733,00:03:18.031,"It's time to explore, time to discover, time to breathe."
00:03:19.991,00:03:21.075,Expansion guides.
00:03:23.161,00:03:28.416,"Oh, no, yeah, Mom, I would love to stay here and do 80 boring chores while you get to go out and meet new survivors."
00:03:28.499,00:03:30.543,-Hydraulic stoppers? -Check.
00:03:30.627,00:03:32.962,"Oh, Judy, you should go, too."
00:03:33.046,00:03:35.173,Just in case someone needs you to do something heroic.
00:03:36.174,00:03:37.342,Activate expansion.
00:03:47.977,00:03:49.687,Expansion failure.
00:03:52.523,00:03:53.650,Leave this to me.
00:04:30.812,00:04:32.522,Whoo! Yeah!
00:04:33.106,00:04:35.108,Woo-hoo!
00:04:38.820,00:04:39.737,All right.
00:04:43.157,00:04:44.826,That was really something.
00:04:52.083,00:04:53.835,"He never leaves your side, does he?"
00:04:57.672,00:04:59.132,So protective.
00:05:06.264,00:05:08.224,Have you asked if there are more like him out there?
00:05:09.600,00:05:10.852,He doesn't talk much.
00:05:11.853,00:05:13.938,I wouldn't be so sure about that.
00:05:15.315,00:05:19.902,"The lights in his face, the way they change? I think he's saying a lot."
00:05:21.738,00:05:23.656,We just don't know how to hear him yet.
00:05:25.575,00:05:31.581,"As a therapist, it's part of my job to read people, know what they're thinking."
00:05:33.124,00:05:36.252,"If you'd like, I could spend some time studying him."
00:05:36.836,00:05:39.672,That's okay. Thank you.
00:05:40.798,00:05:42.091,That's nice.
00:05:43.009,00:05:43.885,What is?
00:05:43.968,00:05:45.845,"You're protective of him, too."
00:06:06.866,00:06:09.327,-Let them know our situation. -Hmm.
00:06:13.539,00:06:14.707,What you looking at?
00:06:15.625,00:06:16.918,Nothing.
00:06:17.543,00:06:20.588,Just trying to get my bearings.
00:06:23.383,00:06:26.636,"Oh, hey, before we get there, nothing about the robot, okay?"
00:06:27.386,00:06:30.098,I shouldn't tell Hiroki? Hiroki's an exobiologist.
00:06:30.181,00:06:33.476,He's literally an expert in alien biology.
00:06:33.559,00:06:34.894,It's not Hiroki I'm worried about.
00:06:36.854,00:06:40.149,It's who he talks to and then who they talk to.
00:06:40.233,00:06:44.112,We don't know how people are gonna react to it. Or it to them.
00:06:46.072,00:06:49.075,The truth will come out eventually. It always does.
00:07:10.346,00:07:13.141,It evidenced both a fear and a pleasure reflex.
00:07:19.105,00:07:21.315,I imagine things get far stranger than that.
00:07:52.263,00:07:53.598,Haven't you learned?
00:07:54.515,00:07:56.767,Only terrible things happen when we go outside.
00:08:00.438,00:08:03.274,Hey. Hi. Don West. Which one of you guys is the doctor?
00:08:03.357,00:08:04.984,I am. Is the patient inside?
00:08:05.651,00:08:08.154,"-What is she, like, 17? -Eighteen."
00:08:13.701,00:08:16.412,Don West. I'm the one who saved her life.
00:08:16.496,00:08:19.457,In case you were wondering who else saves lives around here.
00:08:19.540,00:08:20.917,I wasn't really.
00:08:21.000,00:08:31.219,"I found the ejector seat and promptly administered first aid, She's awake now. Not that it makes much of a difference."
00:08:40.061,00:08:43.314,My name is Judy Robinson. Can you tell me yours?
00:08:56.327,00:08:57.245,Hey.
00:08:58.788,00:09:00.581,You've been through a lot.
00:09:03.125,00:09:04.502,I guess we all have.
00:09:11.300,00:09:13.052,So how many of us are there?
00:09:13.135,00:09:15.513,-There are 63 survivors. -Casualties?
00:09:16.639,00:09:17.557,Twenty-seven.
00:09:20.935,00:09:24.230,We were able to map the locations of 12 Jupiters before we landed.
00:09:24.981,00:09:27.024,"Thirteen now, including yours."
00:09:28.276,00:09:30.528,And not one of these ships can take off?
00:09:31.028,00:09:32.655,Methanogenic chordates.
00:09:33.114,00:09:34.282,The eels.
00:09:45.459,00:09:48.921,What's the technical term for the thing in the bathroom that recycles the...
00:09:49.005,00:09:51.007,-Thermal degradation reactor. -Yeah.
00:09:51.090,00:09:55.011,For us to produce enough bodily waste to get a Jupiter into orbit would take years.
00:09:55.094,00:09:57.597,Excuse me. They're in range.
00:10:08.149,00:10:11.569,"It's day three, 1400 hours."
00:10:11.652,00:10:15.698,"Resolute, this is Naoko Watanabe of the Jupiter 11. Please respond."
00:10:15.781,00:10:17.033,Repairs are proceeding.
00:10:17.450,00:10:24.123,"We've identified and sealed all leaks-- Resolute, this is Naoko Watanabe of the Jupiter 11. Please respond."
00:10:27.835,00:10:30.838,You can't reach them either. They should be receiving our signals.
00:10:30.921,00:10:33.674,You said these were Jupiter locations?
00:10:39.305,00:10:40.973,There's something else out there.
00:10:53.861,00:10:56.113,I'm not gonna hurt you. I promise.
00:11:07.166,00:11:09.335,I'm gonna give you something to help with the pain.
00:11:33.943,00:11:36.112,"It's nice to meet you, Angela."
00:11:42.535,00:11:44.120,Maybe that's part of the Resolute.
00:11:45.496,00:11:47.331,One of the outer storage modules.
00:11:49.875,00:11:55.798,"Something we could use to amplify our broadcast so they could hear us. A synthesizer, at the very least."
00:11:56.507,00:11:57.925,Let's go take a look.
00:11:58.008,00:11:59.760,-You got those radio comms? -Mmm-hmm.
00:11:59.844,00:12:01.303,"Hey! I'll come, too."
00:12:01.846,00:12:03.556,"Uh, no. We're okay."
00:12:04.056,00:12:05.599,"Okay, sure, I get it."
00:12:06.058,00:12:09.270,"To get the comm supplies, you go to F level, aft bay."
00:12:09.353,00:12:11.522,Make three rights and then hook the second left.
00:12:11.605,00:12:15.401,It's compartment 46. Or you could just bring me with you.
00:12:21.866,00:12:24.160,"I mean, it's really smart of you to bring me along."
00:12:24.702,00:12:28.456,"Seriously, credit to both of you. You didn't hesitate."
00:12:28.539,00:12:31.876,"You said, You know what? We gotta find our way. We need Don West."
00:12:31.959,00:12:34.170,"-'Cause the two of us alone-- -Penny, Will."
00:12:39.341,00:12:40.551,Are you there?
00:12:42.553,00:12:45.014,"Yeah, I'm here, Mom. Where else would I be?"
00:12:45.097,00:12:49.268,"Your dad and I need to recover some equipment, so we won't be back for a while."
00:12:49.351,00:12:52.146,Okay. And when do I get to get some fresh air?
00:12:52.229,00:12:57.026,"If you need to leave the Jupiter, which you shouldn't, stay behind the fence."
00:12:57.610,00:12:59.695,And Judy will be back soon to look after you.
00:12:59.778,00:13:01.822,Since when do I need a babysitter?
00:13:01.906,00:13:04.408,Since we were attacked by giant eels.
00:13:04.784,00:13:08.913,Who knows what else is on this planet. Just stay behind the fence. Both of you.
00:13:18.839,00:13:20.299,How did this happen?
00:13:21.634,00:13:23.594,It was an attack.
00:13:23.677,00:13:24.678,What was?
00:13:29.225,00:13:30.559,You can tell me.
00:13:32.978,00:13:35.314,It wasn't an accident.
00:13:36.857,00:13:40.694,The Resolute... it was attacked.
00:13:41.821,00:13:42.905,Attacked?
00:13:45.199,00:13:46.200,By who?
00:13:50.538,00:13:52.331,"Hey, have you seen my parents?"
00:13:52.414,00:13:55.292,They went for supplies. Said to take the Chariot home.
00:13:55.376,00:13:57.002,Look after brother and sister.
00:13:57.086,00:13:58.462,"Okay, thank you."
00:13:58.546,00:14:00.297,-Everything all right? -Yeah.
00:14:14.520,00:14:15.729,Guess who?
00:14:22.319,00:14:25.239,You're right. It's missing something.
00:14:41.380,00:14:42.673,What are you drawing?
00:14:50.764,00:14:51.682,An eight?
00:14:52.933,00:14:54.894,You wouldn't know what an eight looks like.
00:15:07.573,00:15:11.327,A headless snowman with five dots.
00:15:16.790,00:15:19.793,of an artificial intelligence of alien origin.
00:15:20.961,00:15:23.589,"Medium, dirt from unknown planet."
00:15:25.007,00:15:27.217,What would you like to call your masterpiece?
00:15:37.478,00:15:38.687,Let's try something else.
00:15:46.987,00:15:48.405,It's called tic-tac-toe.
00:15:55.579,00:15:56.413,Will.
00:16:01.543,00:16:04.129,-Can I talk to you for a second? -Uh...
00:16:07.758,00:16:08.801,Alone.
00:16:17.476,00:16:18.435,What is it?
00:16:20.145,00:16:24.400,I just saw a patient. She told me what happened on the Resolute.
00:16:25.985,00:16:27.569,She said we were attacked.
00:16:27.945,00:16:32.324,"By a thing with four arms, blades all over its skin, a glowing red face."
00:16:33.575,00:16:36.370,"Of course, I wondered what she was talking about."
00:16:36.787,00:16:39.206,Until she said it was like some kind of robot.
00:16:45.254,00:16:46.130,"Oh, my God."
00:16:47.297,00:16:49.049,-You knew. -No. Where are you going?
00:16:50.050,00:16:51.468,-To call Mom and Dad. -You can't.
00:16:51.552,00:16:52.636,It's dangerous.
00:16:52.720,00:16:55.764,"-He's different now. -It's not a he, Will. It's an it."
00:16:55.848,00:16:57.474,He saved your life.
00:17:01.395,00:17:02.813,"Hey, missed you."
00:17:21.457,00:17:24.835,J2 to Chariot 11. Anybody? Dad?
00:17:28.922,00:17:31.967,Hey. Where you going?
00:17:35.220,00:17:36.889,"Oh, I'm just..."
00:17:40.517,00:17:42.144,...going to collect more stuff.
00:17:43.395,00:17:45.189,You think that's a good idea?
00:17:45.272,00:17:47.191,Your mom said to stay inside the perimeter.
00:17:47.524,00:17:50.736,"Yeah, but I'll be safe. I'm taking the robot."
00:17:52.196,00:17:54.406,"Oh, hey, don't forget your map."
00:18:01.747,00:18:04.458,-Do me a favor? -Don't tell your parents.
00:18:05.876,00:18:07.377,"I was 11 once, too."
00:18:08.212,00:18:09.046,Thanks.
00:18:43.622,00:18:45.457,Finders keepers.
00:18:52.297,00:18:54.133,Why isn't this thing working?
00:18:54.216,00:18:57.511,It's working fine. It's just resetting itself after the power spike.
00:18:57.594,00:18:58.846,Power spike?
00:18:59.263,00:19:03.016,"Yeah. Takes, like, 30 minutes to come back on."
00:19:04.226,00:19:07.437,Is this about Will? Is that why he left?
00:19:07.521,00:19:08.605,He what?
00:19:08.689,00:19:09.982,"Yeah, with the robot."
00:19:11.650,00:19:13.068,The perimeter fence is turned off.
00:19:14.611,00:19:15.946,What's going on?
00:19:18.824,00:19:20.284,You gonna say it?
00:19:22.286,00:19:23.370,"Okay, then."
00:19:25.622,00:19:26.582,No danger.
00:19:27.958,00:19:28.876,Yet.
00:19:42.598,00:19:45.058,"Hey, you can't be out here! Get back inside."
00:19:45.142,00:19:47.686,"So we can wait around until you tell Dad? No, thanks."
00:19:54.359,00:19:55.569,Why we crashed here.
00:19:55.652,00:19:57.613,And now the reason is standing right next to you.
00:19:57.696,00:20:00.407,-Why doesn't that scare you? -Because he's changed.
00:20:00.490,00:20:02.910,-That's not good enough. -How come you don't believe me?
00:20:02.993,00:20:08.207,"Believing has nothing to do with it, Will. It is about me protecting you."
00:20:08.290,00:20:10.209,He's protecting me.
00:20:10.792,00:20:12.794,And what if it changes again?
00:20:15.839,00:20:17.549,"Will, stop."
00:20:21.178,00:20:27.184,"Don't you always say that people make mistakes sometimes, and that they deserve a second chance?"
00:20:29.770,00:20:33.857,"Maybe people do, but-- He's more like us than you think."
00:20:35.400,00:20:37.611,"Look, there's a cave a few miles in this direction."
00:20:37.694,00:20:40.781,Let me hide him away there. That way everyone's safe from everyone.
00:20:40.864,00:20:43.116,Isn't that what you want anyway?
00:20:45.786,00:20:48.497,"Look, Judy, I'm not crazy."
00:20:49.873,00:20:52.000,I know we're gonna have to tell Dad the truth.
00:20:53.001,00:20:56.797,Just... let me be the one to do it.
00:21:06.390,00:21:08.600,You guys realize we're on the wrong side of the fence?
00:21:09.226,00:21:11.520,"So whatever's going on here, I think it's great."
00:21:13.897,00:21:14.982,Or not.
00:21:22.906,00:21:23.907,Hello?
00:21:26.034,00:21:28.912,"Okay, someone is gonna tell me what's going on, though, right?"
00:21:44.553,00:21:47.723,"Ugh, I'd feel better if Debbie was here. For luck."
00:21:47.806,00:21:50.726,I think she's better off being looked after by my daughter.
00:21:50.809,00:21:52.227,"Oh, no, that's Angela."
00:21:53.770,00:21:55.981,-Who the hell's Debbie? -The chicken.
00:21:58.442,00:22:00.694,-You only met one chicken. -You named it Debbie?
00:22:00.777,00:22:03.238,Any chicken that saves my life deserves a name.
00:22:03.322,00:22:04.531,"Okay, I'm listening."
00:22:09.828,00:22:13.415,a moment before an entire desert of black death almost dumped on my head.
00:22:13.498,00:22:15.375,That is a lucky chicken.
00:22:26.762,00:22:29.848,What could have caused a piece this size to break off the Resolute?
00:22:52.662,00:22:54.915,So do you believe him?
00:22:55.707,00:22:57.292,What? That it's changed?
00:22:57.834,00:23:00.295,"Yeah. I mean, it's been pretty helpful so far."
00:23:00.378,00:23:02.506,"If it did something bad once, it can do it again."
00:23:06.093,00:23:09.096,And then I'm gonna tell Dad exactly where it is.
00:23:10.347,00:23:11.348,Will's right.
00:23:11.431,00:23:14.434,"Say what you want about our father, but he knows how to handle a problem."
00:23:16.645,00:23:19.356,"Hey, come on. You're flagging. Have something to eat."
00:23:23.985,00:23:25.153,Check it out.
00:23:26.988,00:23:27.823,Huh?
00:23:33.078,00:23:34.579,It's beautiful.
00:24:30.510,00:24:32.554,I think something's out there. Run!
00:24:39.603,00:24:41.021,Is there another way around?
00:24:43.773,00:24:45.066,Where's the robot?
00:24:52.866,00:24:55.243,See? Useful.
00:25:28.068,00:25:29.110,Yeah!
00:25:31.404,00:25:33.365,"-Sorry. -Watch out, Will."
00:25:47.712,00:25:48.964,Keep your balance. Come on.
00:26:03.186,00:26:04.396,What about you? Any luck?
00:26:04.479,00:26:06.898,No. Just some 3-D printer spools.
00:26:11.861,00:26:12.779,Catch.
00:26:17.367,00:26:23.373,"Hey, you've been there a few times, right? Alpha Centauri. What's... What's it like?"
00:26:23.456,00:26:28.962,"It might be billed as the promised land, but they don't have everything there, so start adjusting your expectations."
00:26:29.629,00:26:31.589,"Like, uh, what don't they have?"
00:26:31.673,00:26:34.634,"For starters, they don't have peat from the Orkney Islands."
00:26:34.718,00:26:37.178,Can't have paradise without quality whiskey.
00:26:37.721,00:26:40.390,The real problem with your colony is the people.
00:26:40.974,00:26:45.854,You travel across millions of miles of space and everybody thinks it's gonna be so different.
00:26:46.229,00:27:02.120,"Whatever people think that they're running away from on Earth, -Hey! I found it. -Yeah?"
00:27:12.714,00:27:15.425,"Okay, don't be angry..."
00:27:16.843,00:27:19.220,"but, uh, this is my stuff."
00:27:19.304,00:27:20.305,You're a smuggler?
00:27:20.388,00:27:22.640,"Ah, I mean, that's just a nasty word."
00:27:22.724,00:27:28.563,"You know, I would say a merchant of goods and products... and beverages."
00:27:28.647,00:27:32.359,You ditched the back-up frequency synthesizers so you could store your stash?
00:27:32.442,00:27:35.195,Why didn't you use the box with the cups in it?
00:27:35.278,00:27:38.698,"-Again, with your choice of words-- -We needed them!"
00:27:57.133,00:28:01.137,"In your experience, does she forget about things quickly, or does she tend to stay mad?"
00:28:01.221,00:28:03.848,You knew the synthesizers weren't here before we left.
00:28:03.932,00:28:07.352,"But to be fair, before we left, I didn't know what they were."
00:28:08.937,00:28:09.813,John.
00:28:11.147,00:28:11.981,Yeah?
00:28:17.362,00:28:18.696,What is it?
00:28:21.157,00:28:24.619,There's the reason they haven't been able to hear our broadcasts.
00:28:32.293,00:28:34.838,"Okay, listen. I can explain this."
00:28:37.590,00:28:40.135,"So are we doing like an IOU, or..."
00:28:41.761,00:28:43.972,"Okay. Well, this one's on me."
00:28:49.269,00:28:50.895,"My, what strong hands you have."
00:29:18.047,00:29:21.050,"No. No, no, no, no no. It doesn't work like that."
00:29:21.134,00:29:23.219,There aren't flowers everywhere.
00:29:24.095,00:29:27.640,These are rocks. Flowers grow in dirt.
00:29:28.433,00:29:30.560,"Hey, that cave isn't too much farther, right?"
00:29:31.227,00:29:33.438,We gotta go before Mom and Dad get home. Penny!
00:29:43.573,00:29:45.992,for one of those family dwelling units in town?
00:29:52.832,00:29:54.709,That's... It's okay.
00:29:58.004,00:30:00.298,"Well, there's lodging at the medical facilities."
00:30:01.841,00:30:03.259,"Wait, you're moving out?"
00:30:13.144,00:30:15.605,My Jupiter's only another six kilometers from here.
00:30:20.860,00:30:26.115,...if they even are Marchantiophyta-- I recognize that guy.
00:30:26.199,00:30:30.203,-That's our colony representative. -Pretty sure Mom voted for the other guy.
00:30:30.286,00:30:33.206,"-Vijay, what did I just say? -I'm coming, Dad."
00:30:49.556,00:30:51.391,Okay. It's okay. Okay.
00:30:51.516,00:30:53.893,Hey. I think someone dropped this.
00:31:05.196,00:31:06.781,Where are you guys coming from?
00:31:07.031,00:31:08.908,Are you with the Jupiter we passed back...
00:31:09.701,00:31:12.328,"Hey, that's mine. Sorry, I'm gonna need that back."
00:31:12.412,00:31:14.831,Oh! What? This thing?
00:31:15.623,00:31:16.749,"Seriously, give it back."
00:31:31.598,00:31:33.641,-What is that? -It's kind of a long story.
00:31:33.725,00:31:36.019,-It's not that long. -It is when you tell it.
00:31:36.102,00:31:40.189,"Hey! Hey, Dad-- -Here's the thing. -Hey!"
00:31:40.273,00:31:42.191,"We're gonna need you to keep this quiet, okay?"
00:31:42.275,00:31:44.402,My dad is in charge. He needs to know about this.
00:31:44.485,00:31:48.031,"No, actually, your dad's in charge on Alpha Centauri."
00:31:48.114,00:31:49.991,"When we get there, tell him whatever you want."
00:31:50.325,00:31:54.704,"Until that point, this needs to stay our little secret."
00:31:56.247,00:31:57.081,Why's that?
00:31:57.165,00:32:04.380,"Because if whatever's in this is as important as it seems, he's gonna do what we say."
00:32:05.632,00:32:06.758,Do we have a deal?
00:32:09.886,00:32:10.887,Okay.
00:32:24.275,00:32:27.570,-I didn't think we'd run into anybody. -Just come on. Let's get this over with.
00:33:11.864,00:33:12.740,Whoa.
00:33:23.001,00:33:26.421,"Yeah. Yeah, I think he'll be fine."
00:33:32.885,00:33:34.095,It's getting late.
00:33:37.682,00:33:38.599,We need to head back.
00:33:46.899,00:33:47.859,Guys?
00:33:49.777,00:33:51.362,Why is nobody answering at the Jupiter?
00:33:53.906,00:33:57.285,"No, we're here. We're here, but, uh, we're busy."
00:34:01.998,00:34:04.250,"Okay, are your sisters there?"
00:34:04.333,00:34:08.629,"Hey, Mom, sorry. We're, uh... We are actually outside right now."
00:34:08.713,00:34:11.424,We are checking and securing the pop-outs.
00:34:12.300,00:34:15.053,It doesn't look like your dad and I are gonna get back tonight.
00:34:15.136,00:34:16.763,Why? Is everything okay?
00:34:16.846,00:34:18.681,We've run into a bit of car trouble.
00:34:25.146,00:34:26.689,That's what I was afraid of.
00:34:27.023,00:34:30.318,You wouldn't be the first colonist to accidentally drain the batteries.
00:34:30.485,00:34:31.652,Are you saying it's my fault?
00:34:34.030,00:34:35.990,to get a full recharge from the solar cells.
00:34:36.699,00:34:39.535,"So, I don't think we'll be back till morning."
00:34:39.619,00:34:42.580,Don't forget to double check the perimeter before you shut down.
00:34:44.207,00:34:47.794,"I feel a little better leaving you guys, knowing that the robot's there."
00:34:48.377,00:34:49.879,"Yeah, about that..."
00:34:53.466,00:34:54.383,About what?
00:34:58.262,00:34:59.514,"Judy, are you there?"
00:35:02.475,00:35:03.351,Judy?
00:35:03.976,00:35:06.229,We'll talk about it when you get back.
00:35:07.522,00:35:09.649,"-Bye, Mom. -Uh, I'll see you tomorrow."
00:35:18.491,00:35:25.790,"So, maybe now that we're not in a hurry, we could stick around a little bit longer."
00:35:25.873,00:35:31.379,"Yeah. It's getting dark outside and if it's this dangerous during the day, I don't wanna see what it's like at night."
00:35:34.799,00:35:35.925,Fine.
00:35:36.843,00:35:38.553,"But we leave at first light, okay?"
00:36:29.353,00:36:32.106,"Really, Penny? You tagged the wall?"
00:36:32.190,00:36:35.109,"Okay, I admit it's not exactly worthy of Lascaux."
00:36:37.111,00:36:39.322,The ancient cave paintings from prehistoric times?
00:36:39.405,00:36:40.907,-Paleolithic. -Upper Paleolithic.
00:36:40.990,00:36:42.491,You're missing the point.
00:36:46.871,00:36:52.376,"This is the same red ocher, here, a billion, billion miles away."
00:36:52.460,00:36:53.294,It's vandalism.
00:36:56.923,00:36:59.759,Why did early humans start to draw?
00:37:01.469,00:37:02.970,I think I figured it out.
00:37:05.598,00:37:08.559,You paint a picture so you can sign it.
00:37:11.979,00:37:18.110,"We might be tiny infinitesimal blips in the universe, but we made it here."
00:37:23.950,00:37:27.453,"Come on, it says The Robinsons."
00:37:29.997,00:37:32.416,Okay. Okay.
00:38:14.500,00:38:17.044,You'll come up with another way to reach the Resolute.
00:38:17.128,00:38:19.922,"What if that was it, that was my last plan?"
00:38:20.006,00:38:23.634,And now there's just... no more plans?
00:38:31.559,00:38:32.977,Never gonna happen.
00:39:38.459,00:39:39.585,Guys...
00:39:40.544,00:39:42.129,"Guys, you gotta come see this."
00:40:29.510,00:40:31.762,I know I didn't tell you I was leaving.
00:40:32.596,00:40:34.515,"Because I, um... I don't know."
00:40:34.598,00:40:37.017,I honestly thought that you'd be happy about it.
00:40:38.602,00:40:41.272,"Yeah, 'cause you're, like, super annoying most of the time."
00:40:42.815,00:40:43.816,"Yeah, I know."
00:40:45.151,00:40:47.862,"Hey, at least you still got Will to boss around."
00:41:01.167,00:41:03.085,I wonder which one is ours.
00:41:05.796,00:41:08.340,"The one we came from, or the one we're going to?"
00:41:10.217,00:41:12.219,"At this point, I'm not that picky."
00:41:13.637,00:41:14.472,Yeah.
00:41:18.893,00:41:21.520,It's not like it's the first time we've been lost.
00:41:21.604,00:41:22.771,That was not my fault.
00:41:22.855,00:41:25.399,That was absolutely your fault.
00:41:25.483,00:41:28.486,"Every hill just led to a bigger, steeper hill."
00:41:28.569,00:41:31.155,Every hill in Tuscany is a magnificent thing of beauty.
00:41:31.238,00:41:33.491,We had to sleep outside that church.
00:41:33.574,00:41:34.992,It was your idea to go hiking.
00:41:35.075,00:41:37.077,You're the one who left the compass at the hotel.
00:41:37.161,00:41:43.375,"Well, it was our honeymoon and I was trying to impress you -with my orienteering skills. -Really?"
00:41:45.377,00:41:47.880,"Well, you impressed me in other ways."
00:41:59.725,00:42:00.809,So...
00:42:02.269,00:42:05.606,"So when we finally get there, do you have any idea where you plan on living?"
00:42:07.066,00:42:08.192,What?
00:42:08.275,00:42:09.818,On Alpha Centauri.
00:42:17.368,00:42:18.827,"I mean, I..."
00:42:20.746,00:42:27.044,"I guess I want to be as close to you and the kids as possible, so-- Sure, but for how long?"
00:42:29.755,00:42:32.174,"-Forget it. -No, did I do something wrong?"
00:42:32.258,00:42:36.178,"No, listen. Believe me, it's better if we don't even get into it."
00:42:37.137,00:42:40.516,"Maureen, please don't shut me down like that. Talk to me."
00:42:42.434,00:42:44.270,"I found the letter, John."
00:42:45.479,00:42:46.605,What letter?
00:42:48.857,00:42:51.110,"Maureen, hey, wait!"
00:42:56.782,00:42:57.700,Earthquake.
00:43:00.536,00:43:01.412,"No, John! No!"
00:43:02.580,00:43:03.581,Get down!
00:43:17.553,00:43:18.596,Here.
00:43:19.430,00:43:20.848,We could have made it.
00:43:20.931,00:43:22.516,"No, John, we couldn't have."
00:43:28.731,00:43:30.149,Hey!
00:43:54.256,00:43:55.674,He'll figure it out eventually.
00:43:56.342,00:43:57.343,Yeah?
00:43:58.802,00:44:00.596,What are we gonna do until then?
00:44:10.481,00:44:11.982,"For the record, I wasn't snooping."
00:44:13.692,00:44:17.404,"The letter, when it came, I... I opened it by accident."
00:44:19.657,00:44:22.701,"Who even uses regular mail nowadays, anyway?"
00:44:23.285,00:44:30.417,"It had that little blue logo in the corner of the envelope, the one that comes on all the invites for the military social functions, and I guess I just..."
00:44:31.377,00:44:34.713,I think I was just excited to get dressed up.
00:44:35.839,00:44:38.884,It had been so long since we'd been dancing.
00:44:42.930,00:44:44.431,And then I read it and I...
00:44:46.016,00:44:54.191,I remember so well where I was because I was supposed to be picking up Judy from soccer and I just sat in the car in the parking lot... crying.
00:44:55.275,00:45:02.616,"And not because you lied to me, but because I was gonna have to lie to the kids."
00:45:03.617,00:45:05.869,And I couldn't tell them the truth.
00:45:05.953,00:45:09.164,That their father wasn't ordered back to his combat post.
00:45:09.248,00:45:13.001,"That he didn't actually have to go, but that he chose to go."
00:45:13.085,00:45:16.964,"Chose to go 6,000 miles away."
00:45:22.219,00:45:26.223,"You know, the world we left behind was a big place."
00:45:26.306,00:45:33.897,And not all of us had the luxury of only feeling responsible for our small little part of it.
00:45:34.481,00:45:37.401,"-That is so not fair. -Hey, you could've asked me to stay."
00:45:42.489,00:45:43.615,You didn't.
00:45:45.826,00:45:51.457,"So, while we're being honest, let's not pretend that my leaving wasn't for the best."
00:45:57.337,00:45:58.881,So is that what we're doing now?
00:46:01.967,00:46:03.177,Pretending?
00:46:09.641,00:46:10.517,Hey.
00:46:13.812,00:46:15.772,Yeah. Just wish we weren't in here.
00:46:18.484,00:46:20.986,"Just so you know, it's gonna take some time to get you out."
00:48:02.296,00:48:05.215,Good morning! Hope you guys slept well.
00:48:05.299,00:48:13.890,"I myself spent the whole night looking through crates for some shaped charges to blow this beautiful hole and save your lives. Now, do I want any kind of compensation?"
00:48:13.974,00:48:15.309,Let's go!
00:48:20.772,00:48:25.444,For my collection? Thanks. That's a good one.
00:48:31.366,00:48:33.118,We'll come back for you.
00:48:40.292,00:48:43.754,I have to go. And you have to stay here.
00:48:46.173,00:48:49.134,"No, you're the one in danger."
00:48:50.385,00:48:53.972,"And I know you want to come, but you can't."
00:48:54.723,00:48:57.684,You have to stay here. Okay?
00:49:04.608,00:49:05.442,No.
00:49:08.987,00:49:10.155,Stay here.
00:50:06.336,00:50:09.506,"Naoko, have you heard from the Robinsons? No one's responding at their Jupiter."
00:50:13.927,00:50:16.138,"Hello, Victor. This is Maureen Robinson."
00:50:20.642,00:50:23.019,"Maureen, I was glad to hear you survived."
00:50:23.103,00:50:25.939,"Next time you want to go off visiting friends, clear it with me first."
00:50:26.023,00:50:29.067,-For your own safety. -I voted for the other guy.
00:50:29.151,00:50:34.573,"-Yeah? Well, I didn't get a vote. -I've been trying to reach you because no one's able to establish contact with the Resolute."
00:50:34.656,00:50:36.575,We're gonna need to amplify the signal.
00:50:36.658,00:50:39.035,"About that, that's not gonna work."
00:50:39.119,00:50:43.582,We found the Resolute's satellite dish. It's down here.
00:50:44.291,00:50:45.208,Here?
00:50:45.751,00:50:48.920,"Yeah. That changes things, doesn't it?"
00:50:52.048,00:50:53.175,"Yes, it does."
00:50:54.801,00:50:55.844,We're gonna need a plan B.
00:50:56.511,00:50:59.389,I'll be at your Jupiter in an hour with some other survivors.
00:50:59.473,00:51:01.183,Be ready to get your hands dirty.
00:51:31.838,00:51:34.674,"-No, we're fine. Thanks. -No big deal."
00:51:34.758,00:51:35.967,Yeah.
00:51:36.051,00:51:37.302,"Hey, thanks."
00:51:38.887,00:51:40.555,-See you later. -See you.
00:52:01.117,00:52:02.661,Hello?
00:52:05.372,00:52:06.331,Anyone here?
00:52:06.414,00:52:07.874,We're back.
00:52:12.379,00:52:13.463,Will!
00:52:21.638,00:52:22.848,Judy?
00:52:26.059,00:52:26.893,Dr. Smith?
00:52:31.273,00:52:32.274,Weird.
00:52:36.778,00:52:39.656,Will. Will.
00:52:43.660,00:52:45.036,"-Hey, guys. -Hi."
00:52:47.789,00:52:51.376,Oh. Hello. I didn't expect you back so soon.
00:52:52.586,00:52:53.587,"Hi, honey."
00:52:53.670,00:52:54.504,"Hi, Mama."
00:52:59.384,00:53:01.219,"-It was boring. -Yeah, it was really boring."
00:53:03.054,00:53:04.514,Where's the robot?
00:53:07.392,00:53:08.226,Hmm?
00:53:10.562,00:53:11.771,What's going on?
00:53:13.565,00:53:16.568,I... I don't know. I think he wandered off.
00:53:19.613,00:53:23.783,We considered going after him. It just seemed pretty irresponsible.
00:53:25.410,00:53:29.748,"Okay. I guess, uh, someone has to go find it."
00:53:29.831,00:53:31.875,I hope it hasn't gone far.
00:53:43.094,00:53:44.930,-You said he. -What?
00:53:46.890,00:53:47.724,The robot.
00:53:50.352,00:53:53.355,-You called him he. -It's just a pronoun.
00:53:55.690,00:53:58.193,"Hey, you are gonna tell Dad the truth tomorrow, right?"
00:54:01.696,00:54:02.530,Will?
00:54:03.448,00:54:05.575,Yeah. Sure.
00:54:06.409,00:54:07.369,Okay.
00:54:07.953,00:54:09.621,You guys think he'll be okay out there?
00:54:10.413,00:54:11.456,The robot?
00:54:12.207,00:54:14.125,Yeah. You picked a good spot.
00:54:14.209,00:54:18.463,We're the only ones who know where he is. He'll be fine.
00:54:34.646,00:54:35.480,At last.
00:54:40.402,00:54:43.113,I was thinking you and I could get to know one another.
00:54:49.536,00:54:51.830,"After all, we have so much in common."
00:54:53.373,00:54:55.959,We were both someone else up on the Resolute.
00:54:57.293,00:55:00.588,Someone to keep secret from the folks down here.
00:55:07.429,00:55:10.932,"The way I see it, I think you and I could help one another."
00:55:14.227,00:55:15.979,The question is...
00:55:17.605,00:55:18.565,how?
00:55:22.777,00:55:25.739,"Will said when he found you, you were in pieces."
00:55:27.157,00:55:28.408,Wounded.
00:55:29.451,00:55:30.702,Dying.
00:55:34.497,00:55:38.960,"If only I'd gotten there sooner, it could have been me."
00:55:39.544,00:55:41.546,Which would have made all this a whole lot easier.
00:55:47.927,00:55:49.345,"Don't worry, I won't hurt you."
00:55:51.473,00:55:54.017,Just like I know you would never hurt me.
00:55:55.518,00:55:59.981,Will made sure of that. Told you never to hurt anyone.
00:56:01.066,00:56:02.442,Ever.
00:56:06.029,00:56:07.614,Turns out that's a bit of a problem.
00:56:08.156,00:56:11.284,"See, I can't go back to the Resolute without some protection."
00:56:12.035,00:56:14.454,The kind that only you can provide.
00:56:14.537,00:56:15.622,But...
00:56:18.416,00:56:22.754,"if we're gonna work together, I need you to have all your options on the table."
00:56:37.727,00:56:39.813,You want to belong.
00:56:40.730,00:56:49.948,Which is why you think you're doing the right thing by following whatever that boy tells you to do.
00:56:51.825,00:56:53.868,But the thing you'll learn about people is...
00:56:57.163,00:56:58.289,they're unreliable.
00:57:00.291,00:57:02.710,They're not loyal like you are.
00:57:02.794,00:57:04.379,They'll turn on you.
00:57:06.131,00:57:08.675,Yes. Even Will Robinson.
00:57:11.886,00:57:12.971,And when he does...
00:57:16.975,00:57:18.893,who will be there to save you?
00:57:23.857,00:57:24.941,Me.
00:02:38.074,00:02:42.453,He looks smaller than yesterday. Is that possible?
00:02:46.541,00:02:47.667,That much?
00:02:53.172,00:02:54.215,It's good you're here.
00:03:02.807,00:03:03.933,Hey there.
00:03:06.436,00:03:07.520,"Hey, Will."
00:03:09.772,00:03:12.191,I know it's been rough so far.
00:03:15.695,00:03:19.407,"But I need you to fight, okay? I need you to fight now."
00:03:31.127,00:03:33.171,for the rest of your life.
00:04:18.216,00:04:20.009,with this much gusto before.
00:04:22.804,00:04:25.473,It has nothing to do with that boy being here?
00:04:25.556,00:04:28.393,No. And he's not a boy. Will's a boy.
00:05:06.264,00:05:07.098,Yeah.
00:05:07.765,00:05:09.767,Let's just hope to hell it works.
00:05:11.185,00:05:15.481,How... How exactly will we know that it works?
00:05:17.108,00:05:18.651,You skipped Victor's speech?
00:05:20.486,00:05:22.030,"Yeah, that makes two of us."
00:05:22.322,00:05:23.948,I'll give you the short version.
00:05:24.365,00:05:26.534,"The Resolute may be deaf, but it isn't blind."
00:05:26.617,00:05:33.458,"So, uh, Victor thinks if he builds a light tower bright enough-- -It will be seen from space. -Yeah."
00:05:34.542,00:05:37.670,Just needs to coincide with the orbit of the Resolute.
00:05:39.255,00:05:42.467,"-Is that possible? -Well, the science people think so."
00:05:42.550,00:05:43.426,What do you think?
00:05:49.932,00:05:51.017,He's gone?
00:05:51.642,00:05:55.438,Yeah. Kids said it just... walked off.
00:05:57.148,00:05:58.357,Interesting.
00:05:58.441,00:05:59.901,These people are already on edge.
00:05:59.984,00:06:04.447,Last thing we need is that thing being drawn in when that big light gets turned on.
00:06:08.659,00:06:10.453,Like a moth to a flame?
00:06:11.412,00:06:12.246,Yeah.
00:06:13.039,00:06:14.582,Something like that.
00:06:20.963,00:06:23.800,"Hey, excuse me. I'll see you back down there."
00:06:34.852,00:06:35.770,Hey.
00:06:37.939,00:06:39.941,-Any luck? -Nope.
00:06:41.067,00:06:42.527,Do you think it's coming back?
00:06:43.319,00:06:44.195,I don't know.
00:06:45.863,00:06:49.117,"Well, there's only so many things we can worry about at a time."
00:06:49.826,00:06:52.328,-You going somewhere? -Trying to.
00:06:52.411,00:06:54.997,-In the middle of all this? -There's something I need to check on.
00:07:00.336,00:07:08.719,"I don't know. Maybe Kepler's Law doesn't apply here, or... or maybe it's the celestial mechanics of the system, or maybe I'm wrong about the gravitational constant."
00:07:08.803,00:07:09.846,-I-- -Which means?
00:07:11.139,00:07:15.685,It's the sun. It's rising earlier and earlier every day.
00:07:16.769,00:07:18.563,"Well, that's what happens on Earth."
00:07:18.646,00:07:20.982,"It's spring, right? It's kinda nice the weather's changing."
00:07:21.065,00:07:25.570,But it's the rate of change. It's way too fast.
00:07:27.113,00:07:28.990,I need to figure this out.
00:07:32.118,00:07:33.953,Okay. I'll come with you.
00:07:35.830,00:07:38.541,I'll be fine. You should work with the kids.
00:07:39.375,00:07:41.878,"Make up for the time you lost. That's why you're here, isn't it?"
00:07:43.504,00:07:49.927,"Look, I will call you if anything-- We might need that Chariot."
00:07:51.596,00:07:52.930,You be careful.
00:07:54.557,00:07:55.892,Don't punch anyone.
00:08:03.524,00:08:05.902,we'll need every available Chariot battery as backup.
00:08:05.985,00:08:07.695,Then we should make sure they don't overheat.
00:08:08.988,00:08:10.198,"What's she doing, anyway?"
00:08:10.781,00:08:12.700,"When she's ready to tell us, she will."
00:08:14.118,00:08:15.786,Don't you have a meeting to lead?
00:08:21.834,00:08:25.588,-How're we doing with the mirrors? -We are applying the last of them.
00:08:25.671,00:08:27.215,"Good, good. And construction?"
00:08:27.298,00:08:29.342,We should be finished with the tower frame by midday.
00:08:30.134,00:08:31.385,And what about electrical?
00:08:31.469,00:08:33.888,"We're about 100,000 watts short of our candela target."
00:08:34.680,00:08:35.556,How'd that happen?
00:08:35.890,00:08:37.975,A team member shorted the lights in the testing phase.
00:08:38.059,00:08:39.727,We don't have time for mistakes.
00:08:39.810,00:08:43.731,You're welcome to take the Jupiter 2 NAV lamps if you want.
00:08:43.814,00:08:45.733,If that gets you where you need to be.
00:08:48.653,00:08:51.239,Wish I'd thought of that. I would've got some sleep last night.
00:08:52.406,00:08:54.116,Okay. Problem solved.
00:08:55.618,00:08:56.452,We good?
00:08:57.161,00:08:58.079,I suppose.
00:08:59.872,00:09:03.918,"But, uh, we need more Mylar foil. The coverage is patchy."
00:09:06.254,00:09:07.880,"Well, let's stop standing around."
00:09:16.889,00:09:19.392,It's actually a really interesting concept.
00:09:19.475,00:09:22.562,"Yeah, and apparently one that requires lots of heavy lifting."
00:09:24.021,00:09:29.610,Something that a particular R-O-B-O-T -could come in handy for. -She's got a good point.
00:09:30.111,00:09:31.904,You guys said I could wait for the right time.
00:09:31.988,00:09:35.825,I did. But isn't this the perfect opportunity to show everyone how useful he could be?
00:09:36.909,00:09:39.328,"So you should tell Dad, as soon as possible."
00:09:39.996,00:09:42.873,"He's gonna be fine, okay, once he has a chance to process it."
00:09:42.957,00:09:49.922,"And to get through the five stages of anger, from furious to mad to PO'ed-- Okay, fine. I'll do it."
00:09:50.339,00:09:52.466,-When? -When he's in a good mood.
00:09:52.550,00:09:54.176,You can't wait that long.
00:10:00.975,00:10:01.809,Huh?
00:10:03.311,00:10:06.522,To tell you that Will refuses to unload his insulation.
00:10:06.606,00:10:08.441,He says it's too itchy.
00:10:10.109,00:10:13.321,"Come on, that's not like you. Just wear a pair of work gloves."
00:10:13.904,00:10:14.947,Okay.
00:10:20.077,00:10:21.370,"He's avoiding me, isn't he?"
00:10:22.496,00:10:26.000,Maybe you should ask Will if you have questions about Will.
00:10:28.085,00:10:31.088,"Dad, you can talk to him. Okay?"
00:10:33.591,00:10:37.219,"Actually, no. Maybe be, like, 20% nicer."
00:10:59.408,00:11:00.660,Need a hand?
00:11:01.994,00:11:02.870,Yeah.
00:11:06.332,00:11:09.168,"Ah, think I'm gonna need a tutorial."
00:11:11.671,00:11:19.470,"So, red can go to black, and black can go to red, but green always goes to the ground."
00:11:22.056,00:11:24.141,"You're a pretty smart kid, you know that?"
00:11:24.934,00:11:28.854,"Thanks, but I'd take brave over smart any day."
00:11:28.938,00:11:33.401,"But bravery without intelligence, that's a very risky thing."
00:11:37.238,00:11:38.614,Haven't seen your robot in a while.
00:11:39.615,00:11:40.783,Do you miss it?
00:11:42.368,00:11:43.327,I guess.
00:11:48.541,00:11:50.000,Can you do me a favor?
00:11:52.336,00:11:53.254,What?
00:11:53.337,00:11:57.716,"Well, um, there's something I need to do."
00:11:59.760,00:12:01.512,Something that's very important.
00:12:03.639,00:12:05.975,And I need the robot's help to do it.
00:12:06.559,00:12:11.981,"I was thinking, maybe if you knew where it was, that maybe you could... bring him here."
00:12:12.064,00:12:12.898,I...
00:12:15.359,00:12:16.360,Don.
00:12:18.320,00:12:19.613,"Oh, my God."
00:12:20.322,00:12:22.783,You made it. I'm so relieved.
00:12:23.367,00:12:25.703,Yeah. I'm relieved I made it too.
00:12:25.786,00:12:28.080,Do you need anything? Can I get you some water?
00:12:28.164,00:12:29.206,Let me get you some water.
00:12:29.290,00:12:32.877,Sure. Maybe that's where my flare gun is. Next to the water.
00:12:32.960,00:12:35.546,"You know, the flare gun you stole when you left me for dead?"
00:12:35.629,00:12:39.133,I would never do that. It was an accident.
00:12:39.717,00:12:42.303,So you stole it out of my pack by accident?
00:12:42.386,00:12:43.220,Well...
00:12:44.680,00:12:46.932,I took it out because I was scared.
00:12:49.560,00:12:54.773,"I thought about shooting it off, but I knew what you'd say, that you'd be annoyed."
00:12:55.441,00:12:57.067,So I put it back.
00:12:57.443,00:12:58.736,But in the wrong bag.
00:13:00.529,00:13:02.948,I've been feeling so guilty.
00:13:06.368,00:13:07.786,Now you're here.
00:13:09.663,00:13:13.959,Okay. Okay. Don't beat yourself up. We both made it.
00:13:16.837,00:13:19.089,"You know, I... I think I saved you."
00:13:21.258,00:13:22.301,You... What?
00:13:23.344,00:13:26.805,My St. Christopher medal. It protected you.
00:13:28.140,00:13:29.683,It brought you good luck.
00:13:30.309,00:13:31.769,Do you still have it?
00:13:32.895,00:13:34.396,The necklace?
00:13:35.856,00:13:36.774,No.
00:13:38.067,00:13:40.861,"No, I lost it. In the storm."
00:13:43.822,00:13:44.823,I forgive you.
00:13:47.868,00:13:50.621,"I gotta go. So we'll talk later, okay?"
00:15:18.834,00:15:20.502,Nothing we wouldn’t be prepared for.
00:15:24.256,00:15:26.133,Are you asking us or telling us?
00:15:30.387,00:15:32.306,Everyone has to be on board.
00:15:32.973,00:15:34.266,"All right, pros and cons."
00:15:34.850,00:15:36.769,"Okay, start with Earth. Uh..."
00:15:37.102,00:15:41.023,"Pro: governments have stabilized, for the most part."
00:15:42.024,00:15:43.901,Pro: the World Cup.
00:15:44.860,00:15:47.154,Pro: my friends are here.
00:15:50.824,00:15:56.705,"Cons: If we stay here, we won't ever see another blue sky, or a rainbow."
00:15:57.289,00:16:01.335,"And as for future Robinsons, there won't be much life left here for them."
00:16:03.879,00:16:05.089,And Alpha Centauri?
00:16:05.923,00:16:08.634,Pros: It's habitable.
00:16:09.385,00:16:11.804,It's a... It's a paradise planet.
00:16:11.887,00:16:15.766,There's no wars. There's no instability.
00:16:16.642,00:16:21.689,You could build whatever. You could be whatever you want there.
00:16:22.523,00:16:25.526,Pro: blue skies.
00:16:28.320,00:16:34.243,Con: It's a one-way ticket. There's no coming back. Ever.
00:16:35.411,00:16:38.497,You're right. It's a really big decision.
00:16:40.082,00:16:41.208,What does Dad think?
00:16:41.792,00:16:45.129,He... wants what's best for everybody.
00:16:45.879,00:16:47.756,So he's coming?
00:16:49.717,00:16:50.926,"Uh, if he can."
00:16:56.140,00:17:00.936,"Judy, only the best of the best get to go."
00:17:01.020,00:17:03.063,They could fast-track your medical career.
00:17:03.647,00:17:07.067,"And Penny, what about first author in space?"
00:17:09.319,00:17:10.571,Can anyone go?
00:17:10.904,00:17:13.323,Anyone who passes the tests.
00:17:14.366,00:17:15.451,There's more than one?
00:17:15.534,00:17:16.535,Don't worry.
00:17:17.494,00:17:18.871,You'll all pass.
00:17:33.677,00:17:34.636,Hello?
00:18:19.348,00:18:23.602,Son of a... Ow! Yeah. It's broken. Ow!
00:18:24.186,00:18:27.564,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. Let a man prepare."
00:18:29.149,00:18:32.069,"I'm not the first person to break your nose, am I?"
00:18:32.152,00:18:33.278,What do you think?
00:18:34.404,00:18:35.906,"Who taught you self-defense there, Doc?"
00:18:35.989,00:18:39.910,-It's Judy. My dad taught me. -Is he here too?
00:18:41.453,00:18:42.996,Yeah. John Robinson's my dad.
00:18:46.125,00:18:48.168,He came into the picture after I was born.
00:18:52.172,00:18:55.050,What are you doing with all of that booze in our Jupiter?
00:18:56.468,00:18:57.553,Sensitive issue.
00:18:58.262,00:19:01.765,-I'm sort of like a importer-exporter. -Smuggler.
00:19:02.558,00:19:05.561,What is the matter with you Robinsons? You make it sound like a bad thing.
00:19:05.644,00:19:06.728,Is it?
00:19:06.812,00:19:08.939,"Obviously never had single malt Scotch, have you?"
00:19:16.697,00:19:17.739,How's Angela?
00:19:19.241,00:19:21.493,Hard to tell. She doesn’t come out of her cabin.
00:19:21.577,00:19:24.913,Does she talk much? About what happened on the Resolute?
00:19:25.414,00:19:28.041,-Not really. Why? -Checking on my patient.
00:19:28.876,00:19:29.710,Wait.
00:19:33.422,00:19:34.965,survived such a big storm.
00:19:37.259,00:19:39.178,Honestly? I didn't think I was gonna make it.
00:19:39.761,00:19:41.138,I didn't think any of us were.
00:19:45.809,00:19:48.729,I just held my breath for as long as I could.
00:19:50.230,00:19:52.691,"Starts the pounding of blood in your ears, right?"
00:19:54.276,00:19:56.862,Louder and louder until you think your head might explode.
00:20:00.616,00:20:01.450,Exactly.
00:20:07.789,00:20:11.043,Oh! You have serious anger issues.
00:20:11.877,00:20:12.836,Oh!
00:20:13.378,00:20:15.464,You said us when you were in the storm.
00:20:15.964,00:20:17.424,"You mean you and Angela, right?"
00:20:17.507,00:20:22.638,"Yeah. Yeah. And, uh, some shrink named Dr. Smith."
00:20:23.931,00:20:25.182,"No, we rescued her."
00:20:29.895,00:20:31.563,"No, she said she was alone."
00:20:36.443,00:20:37.945,I bet she did.
00:20:48.789,00:20:51.583,Hey. You're a tough guy to track down.
00:20:51.667,00:20:55.295,-I thought you wanted me to help. -Yeah. Yeah. I did.
00:20:58.257,00:21:00.300,"Hey, you might want to run those in parallel."
00:21:00.384,00:21:03.720,"That way if one of the lamps shorts, the others won't go out as well."
00:21:04.137,00:21:08.976,"-Like Christmas tree lights? -Yeah. Yeah, exactly."
00:21:15.565,00:21:16.608,I'm sorry I missed so many.
00:21:18.360,00:21:19.486,Christmases.
00:21:24.408,00:21:26.243,"No, I wasn't there and, uh..."
00:21:28.537,00:21:30.330,I know that bothered you.
00:21:39.339,00:21:40.215,The robot.
00:21:41.258,00:21:43.135,I know how close you got.
00:21:44.177,00:21:46.680,Just upped and left. What do you think about that?
00:21:47.931,00:21:52.102,"Um... I... I, um..."
00:21:52.185,00:21:53.312,'Cause I think it hurt.
00:21:55.814,00:21:57.774,Just like it hurt when I left.
00:22:00.444,00:22:04.239,"But I want you to know, I'm not going anywhere."
00:22:08.785,00:22:11.621,"I missed a lot and, um..."
00:22:14.541,00:22:17.961,"I know that we don't always get each other, but..."
00:22:20.964,00:22:21.840,I'm here now.
00:22:27.095,00:22:30.474,"One thing's for sure, it... it kind of hogged all your time."
00:22:30.557,00:22:31.767,"So, uh..."
00:22:33.185,00:22:36.646,The upside is that we get to spend all that time together. Right?
00:22:37.773,00:22:38.690,Yeah.
00:22:39.941,00:22:40.901,Yeah.
00:22:43.737,00:22:46.448,Okay. What do we got going on here?
00:23:13.350,00:23:16.019,Why are you setting these up here? This is the cable path.
00:23:16.103,00:23:17.229,I'm sorry.
00:23:17.312,00:23:23.276,I need these moved to the other side of the tent Use your head.
00:23:42.295,00:23:43.755,Sorry your dad sucks.
00:23:44.840,00:23:47.300,At least he figured out a way for us to signal the Resolute.
00:23:51.346,00:23:54.891,"Um, thanks for keeping our secret about you-know-what."
00:23:54.975,00:23:57.060,I'm not keeping it. You're blackmailing me.
00:23:58.520,00:23:59.646,Or did you forget?
00:24:00.689,00:24:03.567,"-Wow. No quippy comeback. -Okay, give me a second."
00:24:03.650,00:24:06.361,"Okay. One, one-thousand. Nothing?"
00:24:07.571,00:24:10.699,Maybe I'll have one by the time I'm done helping you.
00:24:13.743,00:24:17.247,I can't wait to eat real food again.
00:24:17.330,00:24:21.334,"-The beef ravioli ones aren't that bad. -Yeah. Until you've had, like, 20."
00:24:29.509,00:24:30.760,Is it from here?
00:24:31.887,00:24:32.929,What?
00:24:33.013,00:24:34.222,You know.
00:24:34.764,00:24:36.057,Oh. Uh...
00:24:36.892,00:24:38.977,I'm not sure.
00:24:39.060,00:24:41.188,-Is it sentient? -It's a robot.
00:24:41.271,00:24:44.065,"I know, but its face, those swirling lights. It..."
00:24:50.280,00:24:51.990,How long am I gonna have to keep your secret?
00:24:52.073,00:24:54.201,Until it's not a secret anymore.
00:24:55.035,00:24:57.412,-Can I see it again? -No. Why?
00:24:57.996,00:25:00.165,-Why not? -Because you can't.
00:25:02.250,00:25:04.920,Your parents don't know. Do they?
00:25:07.047,00:25:10.592,"-Does it matter? -Uh, in my experience, yes."
00:25:11.927,00:25:13.094,A lot.
00:25:14.721,00:25:17.098,Know what? I think I'm done helping you for today.
00:25:35.075,00:25:36.952,Heard all about your crash-landing.
00:25:37.661,00:25:41.039,"-I'm sorry, from... from who? -Don. He said he almost died."
00:25:41.957,00:25:42.832,Oh.
00:25:44.584,00:25:46.127,We all thought we were going to die.
00:25:48.421,00:25:50.548,But he said that he was waiting for you.
00:25:52.592,00:25:55.011,"Judy, be careful."
00:25:55.887,00:25:56.888,What do you mean?
00:25:58.098,00:25:59.975,He's not who you think he is.
00:26:01.851,00:26:05.105,"When we crashed, Don's friend died on impact."
00:26:06.106,00:26:10.777,He stole her boots right off her feet. Like it was nothing.
00:26:13.321,00:26:17.117,"-Yeah... Yeah, well, with the storm-- -There was no storm yet."
00:26:18.743,00:26:22.497,I was the one who buried her. Someone had to.
00:26:23.790,00:26:25.417,And the survivor...
00:26:26.042,00:26:28.878,"-Angela? -Yes, Angela."
00:26:30.755,00:26:31.923,She needed help.
00:26:38.054,00:26:39.764,He wanted to wait the storm out.
00:26:40.557,00:26:43.893,It was like he didn't care if she lived or died.
00:26:48.607,00:26:50.859,Then I was the one who had to search for help.
00:26:52.485,00:26:54.279,Why did you tell us you were alone?
00:26:55.780,00:26:58.116,Honestly? I wanted to protect you.
00:26:59.868,00:27:01.786,I wanted to protect your family.
00:27:05.415,00:27:06.958,I should get back to work.
00:27:08.209,00:27:09.210,Okay.
00:28:05.517,00:28:07.519,"Come on, Will. You can do it."
00:28:08.937,00:28:10.522,Stay calm.
00:28:33.294,00:28:34.462,-Hey. -How'd I do?
00:28:34.546,00:28:36.923,You did great. Sit down.
00:28:40.176,00:28:41.010,You okay?
00:28:42.178,00:28:44.013,"I didn't pass, did I?"
00:28:46.307,00:28:48.059,It's just a practice test.
00:28:48.393,00:28:51.438,"But if I don't pass, no one gets to go to Alpha Centauri, right?"
00:28:56.401,00:29:00.905,"Will, listen to me. You won't remember this, but when you were really little, you and I made a deal."
00:29:02.282,00:29:04.075,And you kept your end of the bargain.
00:29:06.995,00:29:08.496,And now it's my turn.
00:29:40.862,00:29:43.740,"Good work. Naoko, how long before they'll be able to see us?"
00:29:43.823,00:29:46.159,The Resolute will be in range in 20 minutes.
00:29:47.160,00:29:52.916,"It will be nice to finally hear a different message, from, We're looking for you, to We see you."
00:30:10.141,00:30:11.100,Light it up.
00:30:30.870,00:30:33.373,-We did it. -Yeah.
00:30:56.980,00:31:00.400,Wow. It's incredible. Beautiful.
00:31:24.132,00:31:25.675,Like moths to a flame.
00:31:32.181,00:31:33.516,What are those things?
00:31:34.809,00:31:35.685,Bugs.
00:31:35.768,00:31:39.063,They're positively phototactic.
00:31:39.147,00:31:41.649,I think you mean positively disgusting.
00:31:42.817,00:31:44.903,As opposed to negatively phototactic.
00:31:45.945,00:31:48.072,It means they're attracted to light.
00:31:53.953,00:31:55.330,"Uh, okay."
00:31:56.039,00:32:01.085,Do you want herb chicken or peanut butter?
00:32:04.088,00:32:05.548,I like to mix 'em.
00:32:06.132,00:32:08.843,Really? Why am I not shocked?
00:32:10.887,00:32:13.431,I saw you talking to Dad. Did he freak out?
00:32:17.268,00:32:18.478,You didn't tell him?
00:32:25.568,00:32:26.569,Don't move.
00:32:32.033,00:32:35.161,"-No! No, no! No! -You're making it worse. Just hold still."
00:32:44.754,00:32:45.672,Thanks.
00:34:04.125,00:34:34.781,Fu-- Best night here by far.
00:34:34.864,00:34:36.616,"Yeah. Yeah, it is."
00:34:37.241,00:34:40.203,What a story we'll have when we get to Alpha Centauri.
00:34:40.912,00:34:42.747,One I could have done without.
00:34:46.751,00:34:53.925,"I... I didn't know how to tell you this before, because I didn't want to interfere with family matters, but there's something I think you should know."
00:34:55.885,00:34:57.720,It has to do with the robot.
00:35:00.056,00:35:00.890,What?
00:35:01.682,00:35:09.982,"When you and Maureen were away, Will took the robot out into the woods. I... I think the girls went too."
00:35:10.066,00:35:13.653,I assumed that they told you. I thought at least Will would have.
00:35:20.368,00:35:21.702,Excuse me.
00:35:33.673,00:35:34.757,Will.
00:35:36.551,00:35:38.469,-Where is it? -Where's what?
00:35:39.053,00:35:40.221,Where's the robot?
00:35:43.933,00:35:45.351,Why are you lying to me?
00:35:45.935,00:35:48.813,"I'm not. I mean, I didn't mean to."
00:35:49.939,00:35:59.699,"I mean, I didn't want to. I... I just-- -Will, why'd you hide the robot? -He was different before."
00:36:00.950,00:36:02.577,What are you talking about?
00:36:05.413,00:36:10.001,"You know how something happened on the Resolute, and then we all crashed?"
00:36:10.084,00:36:11.294,Yeah.
00:36:13.713,00:36:15.381,It was because of him.
00:36:22.346,00:36:23.764,He hurt some people.
00:36:24.473,00:36:27.185,"No. Will, people died."
00:36:27.268,00:36:30.438,But he saved me. He saved Judy.
00:36:30.521,00:36:33.274,He protected us in that storm. He's good now.
00:36:33.357,00:36:34.609,Did he hurt you?
00:36:34.692,00:36:38.112,I can control him. I made him promise to never do that again.
00:36:38.196,00:36:42.241,"Will, you're just a kid. You can't control anything."
00:36:42.825,00:36:47.246,Where is it? Where is it?
00:36:49.749,00:36:52.043,I thought I raised you better than this.
00:36:53.669,00:36:54.754,Is that why you hid it?
00:36:55.171,00:36:57.298,Because you were worried it was gonna hurt us?
00:37:11.979,00:37:12.939,What the hell?
00:37:16.943,00:37:18.069,"Oh, no!"
00:37:30.748,00:37:32.375,Quick! Run!
00:37:32.458,00:37:34.627,Get away from the tower! Find cover!
00:37:35.795,00:37:37.338,"Go! Go, go, go!"
00:37:38.297,00:37:39.131,Penny!
00:37:40.967,00:37:41.884,Judy!
00:37:48.557,00:37:50.017,Over here! Get down!
00:37:53.062,00:37:54.939,Stay down!
00:38:42.737,00:38:44.071,Call your robot.
00:38:44.739,00:38:46.615,Who cares if anyone sees it now?
00:39:55.434,00:40:00.856,"This is Captain Radic broadcasting from the Resolute, day seven, 1900 hours."
00:40:00.940,00:40:04.402,"We have yet to detect any survivors, but we'll redouble..."
00:40:17.289,00:40:19.417,"-Dad. -I got you, Penny. Come on!"
00:40:33.055,00:40:34.807,"Dad, why aren't we running?"
00:40:44.567,00:40:46.193,Where are you?
00:40:50.823,00:40:51.657,You see this?
00:41:47.922,00:41:49.256,Run now.
00:41:56.472,00:41:58.182,Robinsons. Over here!
00:42:10.277,00:42:11.612,He won't fight back.
00:42:13.322,00:42:14.532,Because I told him.
00:42:18.077,00:42:19.495,That was a mistake.
00:42:57.116,00:42:58.075,Fight back.
00:43:00.369,00:43:02.913,"Please, fight back."
00:43:12.965,00:43:15.342,You have to be like you were before.
00:43:18.095,00:43:19.513,You have to be bad.
00:43:22.308,00:43:23.350,Do it.
00:43:24.518,00:43:27.021,Be bad.
00:44:22.076,00:44:23.118,"No, no, not them."
00:44:37.925,00:44:38.801,Will.
00:44:44.682,00:44:45.557,That's it.
00:44:50.354,00:44:51.438,It's me.
00:45:04.243,00:45:05.285,It's me.
00:01:20.789,00:01:22.832,spectroscopic binaries.
00:01:25.251,00:01:28.671,It's hard to tell which one we're in without a map of the star system.
00:01:36.679,00:01:37.514,Shh.
00:01:50.026,00:01:59.369,"If this is our planet and this is a sun, a typical orbit looks like this."
00:02:01.121,00:02:04.040,"Okay, so I'm guessing our orbit isn't typical."
00:02:05.917,00:02:12.507,"the longer days and the increased temperatures, I couldn't figure it out until I got up there and I saw this."
00:02:15.635,00:02:17.053,A coffee mug?
00:02:17.595,00:02:22.851,A black hole. Hiding just off the shoulder of our sun.
00:02:22.934,00:02:33.653,"The gravitational pull is altering the orbit, pulling our planet closer and closer, until, when it makes this turn, nothing on the surface, I mean nothing, will survive."
00:02:42.412,00:02:43.454,How long do we have?
00:02:44.205,00:02:46.207,Till the planet becomes uninhabitable?
00:02:47.458,00:02:49.544,"Weeks, maybe months."
00:02:49.627,00:02:52.130,It's hard to know without more information.
00:02:54.090,00:02:56.301,"So, we have a decision to make."
00:02:56.926,00:02:58.428,Do we tell people?
00:03:09.814,00:03:13.484,"I mean, God, Maureen, you should have seen their faces out there tonight."
00:03:13.568,00:03:19.741,Looking to me to answer questions about that machine that I don't have.
00:03:22.243,00:03:26.122,"So, tomorrow I get to clean up that mess."
00:03:26.956,00:03:28.958,-This one-- -It's okay.
00:03:30.293,00:03:31.419,I'll figure it out.
00:03:34.005,00:03:37.592,"Whatever you decide, I'll support you."
00:04:02.158,00:04:03.910,"Husbands, wives, friends."
00:04:03.993,00:04:06.120,Dead because of what that thing did.
00:04:06.204,00:04:08.623,What about last night? It was protecting us.
00:04:08.706,00:04:10.667,-It was defending itself! -Who knows what would've happened.
00:04:10.750,00:04:13.002,-Maybe it can help us-- -Please! Enough!
00:04:15.088,00:04:18.716,One at a time. Let's not have this devolve into chaos.
00:04:19.467,00:04:21.678,"Victor, if I could make a suggestion."
00:04:22.845,00:04:29.560,"Maybe we should hear from someone who has seen, firsthand, what this thing is capable of."
00:04:32.522,00:04:36.818,"Angela, would you like to tell us anything?"
00:04:43.116,00:04:47.036,My husband was the seventh musician chosen for relocation.
00:04:48.997,00:04:50.248,He played cello.
00:04:52.166,00:04:55.545,He loved football and hated the rain.
00:05:01.092,00:05:06.014,and that thing murdered him in front of me.
00:05:08.099,00:05:14.939,"So to be forced to sit here, listening to people wonder how they can use it..."
00:05:16.482,00:05:17.984,sickens me.
00:05:19.902,00:05:23.364,I think the best course of action would be to treat this as we would at home.
00:05:24.282,00:05:28.328,If a man had committed any of these crimes-- But it's not a man.
00:05:30.288,00:05:31.706,Isn't that the point?
00:05:33.458,00:05:34.375,Angela...
00:05:36.377,00:05:39.464,I'm truly sorry about what happened to your husband.
00:05:40.798,00:05:44.844,There is nothing that we can do or say that can replace that loss.
00:05:45.470,00:05:49.557,But I think that it's important that we understand that the robot has changed.
00:05:49.640,00:05:52.643,"-Changed? John, what are you-- -Let him speak."
00:05:52.727,00:05:58.900,Okay. Think of it like a computer that's been rebooted or reprogrammed.
00:06:01.152,00:06:14.415,"Look, I don't know what the hell this thing was before, or why it's here now, but what I do know is that the only reason my daughter is alive today is because that machine saved her life."
00:06:16.042,00:06:20.880,And it kept my family safe... when I couldn't.
00:06:22.715,00:06:26.594,We're in a place where I think we'd all like to feel a little safer.
00:06:31.641,00:06:34.227,Who's going to keep us safe from it?
00:06:34.310,00:06:36.771,You saw it for yourself. It listens to my son.
00:06:36.854,00:06:38.898,So you'd put our safety in the hands of a child?
00:06:38.981,00:06:40.358,It worked last night.
00:06:40.441,00:06:42.485,"Only difference is, now you all know about it."
00:06:44.028,00:06:47.490,"Okay, everyone. I think we should try and reach a consensus here."
00:07:04.215,00:07:07.760,"I just wanted to say, you're not alone."
00:07:14.225,00:07:16.269,I buried her with my own hands.
00:07:21.441,00:07:23.443,It's good to see that you're on your feet.
00:07:23.526,00:07:25.653,I knew you were a fighter when we found you.
00:07:27.947,00:07:29.824,When you found me?
00:07:30.783,00:07:34.120,Don West didn't mention that I was there with...
00:07:38.374,00:07:42.545,Never mind. Some people need to feel like a hero.
00:07:45.131,00:07:46.757,I'm just happy to see you're on the mend.
00:07:47.717,00:07:49.594,"Well, thank you."
00:07:51.179,00:07:58.561,"For what it's worth, after trauma like you've endured, it could be helpful to speak with a professional."
00:08:09.489,00:08:10.823,Maybe some other time.
00:08:11.699,00:08:12.950,No problem.
00:08:13.826,00:08:15.536,Enjoy your walk.
00:08:37.558,00:08:40.478,"-Souvenir? -Ah, research."
00:08:42.355,00:08:46.400,"If I brought some of that back, too, would that be worth something to somebody?"
00:08:46.817,00:08:51.656,Uh... only if you could keep it from becoming contaminated.
00:08:52.198,00:08:53.491,Could you teach me?
00:09:15.596,00:09:18.224,"Thanks. Oh, here."
00:09:20.768,00:09:25.439,"Protection. In case you didn't notice, it's getting dangerous around here."
00:09:26.107,00:09:52.592,"Last time a pretty lady offered me protection, Maybe you should go back inside."
00:09:53.301,00:09:54.677,But I thought we could help.
00:09:55.011,00:10:01.642,"I mean, there are a lot of heavy things and he can-- Inside. Just until your dad gets back. Go on."
00:10:03.227,00:10:04.228,Okay.
00:10:26.876,00:10:31.464,"If you're wondering if rotting meat smells the same here as it does on Earth, then the answer is yes."
00:10:31.547,00:10:34.967,"Well, I'm going swimming at the waterfall."
00:10:35.843,00:10:37.887,-We haven't tested the water yet. -So?
00:10:37.970,00:10:39.847,So it could kill you.
00:10:42.016,00:10:45.353,"Besides, I told my dad I'd do this, so..."
00:10:45.436,00:10:48.939,"All right, whatever. I'm gonna go. You can come if you want."
00:10:55.112,00:10:56.030,Wait up.
00:11:02.036,00:11:05.623,"John, tell Maureen I'd like to talk to her when she has a minute."
00:11:05.706,00:11:06.832,About what?
00:11:07.500,00:11:10.378,"We're out of fuel, can't reach the Resolute, audibly or visibly."
00:11:11.545,00:11:14.548,Might be time to consider the reality of long-term habitation of the planet.
00:11:15.716,00:11:17.968,Right. I'll let her know.
00:11:35.069,00:11:36.737,-The robot stays. -Yes!
00:11:37.697,00:11:39.532,But there are conditions.
00:11:40.074,00:11:48.416,"You keep it away from other people, you report any changes in behavior, and register its whereabouts at all times."
00:11:48.499,00:11:51.419,"Yeah, no problem. I want to show you something."
00:11:56.298,00:11:59.301,-He doesn't get it. -Let him be happy for a minute.
00:12:08.519,00:12:10.062,You gonna tell him?
00:12:10.146,00:12:11.480,About what?
00:12:12.982,00:12:14.191,The coffee mug.
00:12:15.109,00:12:17.319,I made a list. Stuff the robot could do to help people.
00:12:17.403,00:12:20.489,"And then when they see how awesome he is, they'll accept him."
00:12:21.073,00:12:23.576,"Actually, I had something else in mind."
00:12:23.659,00:12:26.370,-Why don't you help me today? -With what?
00:12:26.454,00:12:30.458,I'll tell you later. It's kind of a father-son thing.
00:12:34.920,00:12:39.675,"Actually, I forgot, it's more of a father-son-robot thing."
00:12:51.353,00:12:53.939,"Oh, yeah. Right. We're heading off."
00:13:02.990,00:13:06.368,"Man, those Robinsons can be a real pain in the ass, right?"
00:13:06.452,00:13:09.705,"Always sticking their noses in-- -Sorry, do I know you? -Don West."
00:13:09.789,00:13:14.001,"I wouldn't expect a guy like you to know a guy like me, but you look like someone who can get things done."
00:13:14.084,00:13:15.628,Talk to Peter Beckert. He handles my affairs.
00:13:18.964,00:13:23.385,"You know, enough to get everyone here off this planet, back into space?"
00:13:23.469,00:13:26.180,I'd say you were mistaken. Whatever fuel was left in the Jupiters is gone.
00:13:26.263,00:13:28.516,"Oh, the eels. Yeah. Yeah, heard about them."
00:13:30.684,00:13:34.688,"From what I understand, those slippery bastards need moisture to survive."
00:13:35.940,00:13:38.067,"My crew and I, we crashed in the desert."
00:13:38.776,00:13:46.075,"Auxiliary fuel tanks, untouched, just sitting there, waiting for a smart community leader to claim them."
00:13:46.742,00:13:49.453,"Dare I say, that man will be a hero."
00:13:50.246,00:13:51.705,And what would that make you?
00:13:53.207,00:13:56.794,"Significantly wealthier. You can arrange that, right?"
00:14:11.225,00:14:12.810,"Ooh, the future."
00:14:13.561,00:14:15.646,What's your schedule like the next 24 hours?
00:14:17.064,00:14:18.065,Come on.
00:15:51.325,00:15:53.452,"Mom, what are you doing?"
00:15:53.535,00:15:57.748,"I'm just bringing some supplies in case we have to spend-- You don't think you're going, do you?"
00:15:58.540,00:15:59.875,Of course I'm going.
00:16:01.043,00:16:03.879,You need to rest. You haven't given yourself time to properly heal.
00:16:03.963,00:16:06.507,I'm healing fine. I'll heal later.
00:16:08.509,00:16:11.136,I don't think you fully comprehend how badly we need that fuel.
00:16:11.220,00:16:12.137,I fully do.
00:16:12.721,00:16:16.767,Which is why we can't bring anyone whose physical limitations might get in the way.
00:16:17.351,00:16:18.978,It's a straightforward thing.
00:16:19.061,00:16:23.607,"We find the Jupiter, we transfer the fuel, we bring it home. We got this."
00:16:23.691,00:16:25.150,Let someone else save the day for once.
00:16:31.991,00:16:34.326,Okay. Go.
00:16:35.536,00:16:38.205,"Just make sure you bring that fuel back safely, okay?"
00:16:44.837,00:16:48.924,Just be safe out there. You don't know what you might find.
00:16:49.883,00:16:50.801,Okay.
00:17:27.713,00:17:28.797,Mmm.
00:17:29.631,00:17:33.844,Have many people been talking to you? In a professional capacity?
00:17:33.927,00:17:37.181,"Yeah, some. It's an unusual time."
00:17:38.891,00:17:43.520,Would you like to talk to me? In a professional capacity?
00:17:44.438,00:17:47.566,-I wouldn't want to impose. -Not a problem.
00:17:54.198,00:17:56.158,Have you ever spoken to a therapist before?
00:17:58.327,00:18:01.455,"You and John-- Oh, no, that wouldn't have worked."
00:18:01.538,00:18:03.040,Never know until you try.
00:18:09.630,00:18:11.215,What's on your mind?
00:18:12.549,00:18:13.801,"It's about you, actually."
00:18:15.928,00:18:16.887,Me?
00:18:16.970,00:18:18.680,I was wondering how you deal with it.
00:18:19.306,00:18:21.266,Being the keeper of all those secrets.
00:18:22.851,00:18:25.229,With all the things people tell you.
00:18:34.530,00:18:40.369,"Don't you ever feel a responsibility to... I don't know, tell someone?"
00:18:48.210,00:18:54.049,What if you found something out that really would impact someone else's life?
00:18:54.133,00:18:57.344,"I mean, how do you keep that in?"
00:18:57.427,00:18:59.429,"Look, here's the thing."
00:19:00.973,00:19:05.269,You have to find a place inside...
00:19:08.856,00:19:10.482,a little box...
00:19:13.652,00:19:16.530,where you put things you don't want anyone else to know.
00:19:19.366,00:19:25.289,"And that box has to be airtight, so nothing gets out."
00:19:27.082,00:19:30.794,"Once something goes in there, it stays in there."
00:19:33.297,00:19:38.594,Where it can't hurt you... or anyone else.
00:19:42.598,00:19:44.141,It's the only way to survive.
00:19:47.269,00:19:49.313,-Okay. -Why do you ask?
00:19:51.106,00:19:55.110,Is there something that you'd like me to help put in your box?
00:19:59.656,00:20:00.991,Dr. Smith speaking.
00:20:04.036,00:20:05.996,"Yes, how are you?"
00:20:06.079,00:20:08.332,"If the offer still stands, I..."
00:20:08.790,00:20:09.917,"Sorry, it's a patient."
00:20:10.667,00:20:14.087,"-Oh, yes. Oh, of course, yeah. -Okay."
00:20:14.171,00:20:15.005,We'll talk again.
00:20:15.797,00:20:17.382,"Okay, excuse me."
00:20:20.594,00:20:22.512,"Yes, Angela. Where are you?"
00:20:22.596,00:20:24.264,I'm at the Watanabe Jupiter.
00:20:24.681,00:20:25.849,I'll be right over.
00:20:37.444,00:20:40.405,"That's okay, but, uh, thanks."
00:20:40.489,00:20:42.449,We have ones like that back on Earth.
00:20:51.083,00:20:52.376,Whoa.
00:20:56.713,00:20:57.547,Thanks.
00:21:25.284,00:21:26.118,Coming!
00:21:27.744,00:21:29.037,You teach him to do that?
00:21:33.542,00:21:36.086,"I guess he's, uh... I guess he's learning."
00:21:39.715,00:21:41.675,"-Hey, Dad? -Yeah?"
00:21:42.718,00:21:44.177,I just realized.
00:21:46.054,00:21:48.432,-I forgot to say thank you. -For what?
00:21:49.891,00:21:51.518,Sticking up for him.
00:21:51.601,00:21:54.521,I wasn't sticking up for anybody. I was just stating the facts.
00:21:54.604,00:21:55.689,But still.
00:21:56.982,00:21:59.860,Can you imagine what it's gonna be like when we get to Alpha Centauri?
00:21:59.943,00:22:02.654,I'll be the only kid with his own robot.
00:22:02.738,00:22:04.072,Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
00:22:04.156,00:22:06.575,Penny's always saying how she wants to write a book.
00:22:06.658,00:22:09.119,-Maybe she can write it about us. -Will.
00:22:30.891,00:22:34.102,"Repaired about a hundred of these, never once got to drive one."
00:22:34.728,00:22:36.396,"But you do know how to drive, right?"
00:22:49.743,00:22:53.372,"-Must be gas, trapped below the surface. -What, like a space fart?"
00:22:53.455,00:22:55.082,They're called cryogeysers.
00:22:55.165,00:22:56.625,"On Mars, they spit CO2."
00:22:56.708,00:23:01.421,"On Triton, it's nitrogen. Heat from the sun-- All right, whatever. Is it safe to keep going?"
00:23:01.505,00:23:04.800,As long as we stay up here and don't drive into the field of exploding rocks.
00:23:09.346,00:23:12.390,"That's a negative, Captain. We're just plotting our course."
00:23:12.474,00:23:14.559,We're not here for sightseeing. Let's move.
00:23:18.105,00:23:20.941,-That's the best idea this guy has had. -How so?
00:23:21.441,00:23:23.235,Let's move.
00:23:27.906,00:23:29.616,"Don, this isn't a road trip."
00:23:29.699,00:23:30.617,It is now.
00:23:39.960,00:23:41.294,Whoo-hoo!
00:23:43.922,00:23:45.298,"Wow, this thing can move!"
00:24:00.230,00:24:02.566,Why would they put a sunroof if we couldn't open it?
00:24:02.649,00:24:04.693,It's not a sunroof. It's an emergency escape hatch.
00:24:04.776,00:24:08.113,"Given everything that's happened, don't you think we deserve a little escape?"
00:24:09.364,00:24:10.574,You know you wanna.
00:24:11.491,00:24:15.787,"Come on, Doc. Get up there, reach up to the sky."
00:24:16.371,00:24:19.749,Huh? Give us a whoo-hoo like it's a limo on prom night.
00:24:19.833,00:24:22.836,"-Yeah, well, I never went to prom. -Seriously?"
00:24:22.919,00:24:24.296,Yeah. I was studying for MCATS.
00:24:24.379,00:24:27.424,"Then you, my nerdy friend, have a lot of catching up to do."
00:24:29.676,00:24:30.886,"-Come on, Judy. -Come on."
00:24:33.805,00:24:36.558,"Yes, finally. Loosening up."
00:24:52.616,00:24:53.825,You've got to be kidding me.
00:24:57.287,00:25:02.542,"It looks like she's having fun. Can we-- No, Diane, we cannot."
00:25:03.585,00:25:04.878,Get her back inside. Now.
00:25:04.961,00:25:06.338,Come back. Come back in.
00:25:09.507,00:25:12.135,"Copy that, sir. We're having visibility issues."
00:25:15.805,00:25:17.265,Better pray that fuel is still there.
00:25:17.349,00:25:21.895,"Seeing that this is our last chance off this planet, think we better all pray."
00:26:00.433,00:26:03.436,"We're not much of an advertisement for space travel, are we?"
00:26:05.272,00:26:06.815,It should come with a warning.
00:26:07.274,00:26:11.027,Your trip to Alpha Centauri may cause anxiety and high blood pressure.
00:26:11.653,00:26:17.075,"Side effects could include loss of communication, eels in your fuel tank."
00:26:17.158,00:26:18.994,Alien robots.
00:26:20.912,00:26:25.458,"I'm sorry. I should have said something. Especially to you, and I..."
00:26:32.841,00:26:35.760,"There is something, though, that I need to share with you."
00:26:40.432,00:26:42.726,That they may not be safe here much longer.
00:26:43.310,00:26:47.897,How... What? How did you-- Lucky guess. But there are signs.
00:26:47.981,00:26:51.109,"Erratic weather patterns, wildlife migration."
00:26:52.277,00:26:54.904,Even the oldest trees have only one ring.
00:26:55.655,00:26:58.241,The life cycle on this planet is quite remarkable.
00:26:58.992,00:27:01.411,"Birth, death, repeat."
00:27:02.078,00:27:03.288,Why didn't you say something?
00:27:03.371,00:27:06.416,It would have been irresponsible. Cause panic.
00:27:06.833,00:27:09.002,You saw how they were with your boy's machine.
00:27:09.919,00:27:12.255,"And we're scientists, Maureen."
00:27:12.797,00:27:16.301,"Just because we know something, we're not compelled to broadcast it."
00:27:17.218,00:27:20.347,Information does not exist in isolation.
00:27:21.264,00:27:23.141,There's consequences. Context.
00:27:27.687,00:27:30.857,"If they come back with the fuel, we'll all get off this planet."
00:27:31.858,00:27:33.693,Everybody will be happy.
00:27:35.487,00:27:38.490,"Go dress your wounds, get some rest."
00:27:39.240,00:27:41.034,They'll need you when they get back.
00:27:54.756,00:27:57.384,Come on. Have you ever heard of the phrase carpe diem?
00:27:57.467,00:27:59.135,"Yeah, seize the day."
00:27:59.219,00:28:02.639,But can't we seize it from the safety of the Jupiter?
00:28:02.722,00:28:05.308,Where is your sense of adventure?
00:28:10.605,00:28:12.857,"Just, like, a little bit."
00:28:14.192,00:28:16.152,And if you will follow me...
00:28:21.449,00:28:24.202,"-It's a cool waterfall, Penny. -Shut up."
00:28:25.370,00:28:26.746,Where did it go?
00:28:26.830,00:28:30.625,"It dried up. It's been getting hotter, maybe the glacier melted."
00:28:34.295,00:28:35.630,It's not a big deal.
00:28:37.215,00:28:40.009,"-We could go somewhere else-- -No, I had it all planned."
00:28:41.094,00:28:41.928,All what planned?
00:28:42.804,00:28:45.348,This. Here. You. Me.
00:28:45.432,00:28:49.519,"I was gonna fall in and pretend to be in trouble, and then you would jump in and save me."
00:28:49.602,00:28:54.107,"And we would be wet and laughing at how stupid it was, and then you would lean in and..."
00:28:55.233,00:28:57.235,-And what? -Nothing.
00:28:58.903,00:29:00.530,"Come on, it was just getting to the good part."
00:29:00.613,00:29:03.032,"That's not funny. Forget it, it's ruined."
00:29:03.116,00:29:04.617,Don't say that. Well...
00:29:07.787,00:29:10.707,"-We have plenty of time. -No, actually, we don't."
00:29:12.292,00:29:14.085,"We're stranded here, Penny."
00:29:17.005,00:29:18.506,We have all the time we want.
00:29:19.299,00:29:21.259,"The planet is dying, okay?"
00:29:23.261,00:29:24.137,What?
00:29:27.849,00:29:31.060,What are you... What do you mean?
00:29:33.897,00:29:41.654,"My mom says that there's a giant black hole somewhere up there, and all I know is that no one and nothing is gonna survive it."
00:29:42.781,00:29:43.656,Are you serious?
00:29:46.910,00:29:51.706,"We have to tell people. My dad-- No. No, no, no. I'm not even supposed to know."
00:29:51.790,00:29:53.041,You can't tell anybody.
00:29:53.625,00:29:55.794,"Please, promise me you're not gonna tell anybody."
00:29:56.628,00:29:59.506,"-Promise me. -Okay, I promise."
00:30:03.301,00:30:04.511,Then let's go.
00:30:27.617,00:30:28.910,This doesn't make sense.
00:30:30.453,00:30:33.331,It was here. It was right here.
00:30:56.145,00:30:57.230,Maybe it fell.
00:30:58.731,00:31:01.109,You brought us all the way here for Maybe it fell?
00:31:01.776,00:31:03.987,"Deal's off, West. Let's go."
00:31:04.070,00:31:06.489,Everybody load up. Maybe we'll get back before dark.
00:31:06.865,00:31:10.410,"What does he mean, deal's off? What deal?"
00:31:14.414,00:31:17.000,Your pal here demanded money to show us where the fuel was.
00:31:17.083,00:31:18.459,He's a real hero.
00:31:21.588,00:31:22.589,Don?
00:31:25.508,00:31:29.596,"In my defense, it was supposed to be a confidential-type arrangement."
00:31:30.972,00:31:35.852,"This is about our survival, life and death, and you were holding it hostage?"
00:31:35.935,00:31:39.731,"Okay, so, when a doctor gets paid for saving someone's life, that's okay."
00:31:39.814,00:31:41.274,-But when a guy like me-- -That's different.
00:31:41.357,00:31:45.820,"Different how? If the fuel was here, everyone would've been saved 'cause of me."
00:31:46.404,00:31:48.573,You get on a shuttle to the new world. What do I get?
00:31:48.907,00:31:52.577,A hearty handshake and a ticket back to a dying planet with no future.
00:31:52.660,00:31:56.372,"So forgive me, princess, if I ask for a little compensation."
00:32:02.795,00:32:03.796,Did you hear that?
00:32:05.882,00:32:07.008,"Oh, my God! It's here."
00:32:07.091,00:32:10.178,"Hey, it's here! Come here, we've been standing on it!"
00:32:19.604,00:32:21.731,"Whoa. Slow, slow, slow. Back up slowly."
00:32:29.614,00:32:31.616,"See, I knew it was here the whole time."
00:32:31.699,00:32:34.786,We don't know if the fuel's still inside. Don't count your chickens.
00:32:34.869,00:32:39.248,"Oh, I won't be counting them, sir. I only have the one. Her name is Debbie."
00:32:40.375,00:32:42.627,"So, who's got the shovel?"
00:32:55.390,00:32:56.766,Apology accepted.
00:32:58.142,00:33:00.228,Fill her up. Let's get out of here.
00:33:25.586,00:33:26.629,Yep.
00:33:28.006,00:33:30.550,"But we're not here for the view, Will."
00:33:30.633,00:33:33.011,Then why did we hike up all this way?
00:33:40.435,00:33:42.854,-Why? -Just do it.
00:33:45.356,00:33:47.442,"Come on, I need to go grab a rock."
00:33:47.525,00:33:48.693,Not him.
00:33:50.403,00:33:51.320,Just you.
00:33:53.656,00:33:54.824,Stay here.
00:34:05.877,00:34:06.961,Big as you can carry.
00:34:22.310,00:34:23.644,"Come on, you can do it."
00:34:36.407,00:34:37.241,Done.
00:34:37.325,00:34:41.079,Not quite. We need 26 more just like that.
00:34:44.248,00:34:45.875,"No, no, no. I'm just..."
00:34:47.960,00:34:51.339,I'm just trying to help you understand that you have a responsibility now.
00:34:54.509,00:34:58.012,This is about him. Isn't it?
00:35:00.723,00:35:01.557,In a way.
00:35:01.641,00:35:03.768,"But I already know what I'm doing, Dad."
00:35:04.310,00:35:09.065,I can control him. You saw. He listens to me. He does what I say.
00:35:09.148,00:35:10.900,"Will, he is not a tool."
00:35:10.983,00:35:13.319,I know. He's more than that.
00:35:16.239,00:35:20.451,He's my friend. He's there when I need him.
00:35:25.873,00:35:30.294,"But he wasn't always your friend, was he?"
00:35:34.715,00:35:42.181,"As much as we'd all like to change the past, undo our mistakes, we can't."
00:35:44.308,00:35:46.394,We have to live with our history.
00:35:47.645,00:35:53.734,"So, in honor of that, we're gonna place 27 stones here today."
00:35:55.278,00:35:56.529,A cairn.
00:35:57.280,00:36:03.828,A monument to all those who lost their lives in the attack on the Resolute.
00:36:13.838,00:36:18.885,"You know, today, I... I spoke to a woman named Angela."
00:36:21.262,00:36:23.222,She lost her husband on the Resolute.
00:36:27.602,00:36:29.437,This first one's for him.
00:36:43.784,00:36:44.785,Okay.
00:36:47.121,00:36:48.331,How do I do that?
00:36:53.085,00:36:58.090,I want you to start by sharing what you remember about that day.
00:36:59.634,00:37:06.724,"Well, like everyone else, when the alarm went off, we had no idea what it was for."
00:37:07.308,00:37:11.979,I remember Josh making jokes so I wouldn't worry.
00:37:13.272,00:37:16.067,Tell me about the moment where you first encountered the machine.
00:37:21.781,00:37:28.037,"Outside the hangar, there was panic, running, shoving."
00:37:29.997,00:37:33.167,"At first, we thought it's just the way people are."
00:37:34.627,00:37:37.380,Trying to be the first ones to reach their Jupiter.
00:37:39.507,00:37:46.806,"But then, we realized they weren't running toward something."
00:37:48.099,00:37:49.183,They were running away.
00:37:51.352,00:37:56.899,That... thing was in there.
00:37:57.441,00:38:02.989,"Anyone who got in its path, it just... eliminated."
00:38:09.704,00:38:15.459,Now it's time to access your sense memories.
00:38:15.543,00:38:17.253,I want you to lie down...
00:38:18.921,00:38:20.172,close your eyes.
00:38:28.306,00:38:33.561,I want you to focus on the sounds...
00:38:36.355,00:38:37.982,the smells.
00:38:44.071,00:38:49.201,"like something very close, except it's everywhere."
00:38:51.954,00:38:55.333,And then I smell burning.
00:39:05.259,00:39:06.677,What do you see?
00:39:09.972,00:39:13.225,"So, it was hard to make out where we were."
00:39:14.643,00:39:16.562,Josh held my hand.
00:39:18.856,00:39:21.567,We tried to skirt the perimeter to our Jupiter.
00:39:22.318,00:39:25.571,It was... It was so close.
00:39:28.866,00:39:30.201,And then...
00:39:31.077,00:39:32.578,he stopped.
00:39:41.212,00:39:47.343,"He was hot, searing, white heat."
00:39:52.973,00:39:55.351,It had burned into mine.
00:40:02.316,00:40:05.694,I'm sorry. Can we please not do this anymore?
00:40:08.322,00:40:09.281,Of course.
00:40:10.699,00:40:13.285,I think we've gone far enough for this session.
00:40:13.369,00:40:23.754,"I thought talking about it would make me feel better, What if we don't have time?"
00:40:25.131,00:40:28.134,"Angela, I... I understand your anger..."
00:40:29.552,00:40:31.178,that this thing...
00:40:32.263,00:40:38.060,that did this to your husband is being welcomed among us.
00:40:38.853,00:40:46.068,But what prevents people from moving on from tragedy is a feeling...
00:40:47.695,00:40:51.699,that there's something they could do to change it.
00:40:53.409,00:40:56.704,But there isn't. There simply isn't.
00:40:57.997,00:41:01.375,"All we can do is hope, pray..."
00:41:02.626,00:41:04.837,it doesn't happen to anyone else.
00:41:05.963,00:41:10.050,What if there is something I could do?
00:41:12.261,00:41:15.890,Something more than just hoping and praying.
00:41:16.307,00:41:21.645,"I'm sorry, Angela, but I'm gonna have to ask you to refrain from saying anything further on this subject."
00:41:22.813,00:41:24.482,Maybe I should go.
00:41:30.488,00:41:35.910,You can't just make me relive all that and then-- I'm sorry. We can pick this up tomorrow.
00:41:40.498,00:41:42.041,Dr. Smith?
00:41:56.096,00:41:57.723,Let me give you a hand.
00:41:58.807,00:41:59.642,No.
00:42:03.729,00:42:04.939,I should do this one.
00:43:02.621,00:43:04.123,"So, we good?"
00:43:05.416,00:43:08.168,-Are you referring to our arrangement? -Yeah.
00:43:08.669,00:43:10.671,We're good when we get the fuel safely back.
00:43:10.754,00:43:11.964,What does that mean?
00:43:12.047,00:43:14.717,It means you need to stop standing around and start helping.
00:43:15.426,00:43:16.385,How much longer?
00:43:16.468,00:43:19.305,"Once we start the transfer, about three hours."
00:43:19.388,00:43:21.890,"Yeah, well, uh, let's try and make it two."
00:43:21.974,00:43:25.978,"Would you like me to change the laws of physics, or just lie to you?"
00:43:29.732,00:43:31.191,"Okay, everyone, listen up."
00:43:32.067,00:43:37.072,"In just three hours, we're gonna have a tank full of liquid methane ready for transport. I..."
00:43:40.451,00:43:41.452,What is it?
00:43:41.827,00:43:42.703,-Me? -Mmm.
00:43:42.786,00:43:48.083,"Yeah. I was just wondering what we're gonna do when the Jupiter falls off the edge, takes the fuel tank with it?"
00:43:48.167,00:43:50.044,Clearly we're hoping that's not gonna happen.
00:43:50.127,00:43:54.256,"Oh, you can have all the hope you want, but gravity may have other plans."
00:43:54.340,00:43:58.969,"You see, Vic, the west side of the Jupiter is hanging over the edge."
00:43:59.470,00:44:02.139,"Now, the auxiliary fuel supply, that's on the east side."
00:44:02.222,00:44:05.434,"As we transfer the fuel out, the east side gets lighter."
00:44:05.809,00:44:09.730,"The weight shifts to the west side, sending it over the edge."
00:44:10.648,00:44:13.400,And since our hose is connected to the tanker...
00:44:14.526,00:44:18.530,"Okay, so do you have a better idea? Or do you want us to pay for that, too?"
00:44:18.614,00:44:20.366,We use the Chariots as an anchor.
00:44:20.449,00:44:22.743,"We dig down, attach the towlines to the Jupiter."
00:44:22.826,00:44:25.371,"With the torque in the engines, we counteract the shift in the weight."
00:44:26.872,00:44:29.917,It might. Just gotta get the right guy behind the wheel.
00:44:30.000,00:44:31.335,Or right girl.
00:44:31.919,00:44:34.546,"No offense, but who do you expect to handle this?"
00:44:34.963,00:44:37.633,Somebody who saves lives or somebody who gambles with them?
00:44:37.716,00:44:40.427,No offense? How is that not offensive?
00:44:42.471,00:44:43.931,"Don't let us down, Robinson."
00:45:03.617,00:45:05.244,It's pretty embarrassing.
00:45:06.078,00:45:07.371,"Oh, um..."
00:45:08.914,00:45:14.795,"I almost forgot. Everyone knows about the robot, so guess I don't need that anymore."
00:45:16.964,00:45:17.840,Thanks.
00:45:23.804,00:45:26.598,Don't worry about it. Back there.
00:45:27.266,00:45:29.560,Everybody does embarrassing things when they think they're gonna die.
00:45:29.643,00:45:31.854,"Yeah, well, not like me."
00:45:36.108,00:45:38.193,Do you wanna know why I didn't want you to see this?
00:45:40.195,00:45:41.572,It's something I wrote...
00:45:43.615,00:45:47.578,when our Jupiter was crashing and I didn't think we were gonna make it.
00:45:55.711,00:45:56.712,Read it.
00:45:58.213,00:45:59.214,Really.
00:46:14.480,00:46:15.481,It's a poem.
00:46:16.356,00:46:20.360,"Yeah, uh, a testimony. In case anyone found our bodies."
00:46:21.069,00:46:23.363,"If you find this message, do not weep."
00:46:23.447,00:46:25.741,"I have lived a life, I was not a creep."
00:46:26.283,00:46:28.994,"I did not like books, but loved my guitar."
00:46:29.077,00:46:32.623,Brought my music to space and traveled afar.
00:46:39.505,00:46:41.423,You try and rhyme when you're hurtling to your death.
00:46:42.799,00:46:46.386,"I am Vijay Dhar, aged 16 years."
00:46:46.470,00:46:49.973,I loved free climbing and I faced my fears.
00:46:50.682,00:46:54.561,"I once had vertigo, but then overcame it."
00:46:54.645,00:47:00.234,Won a state-wide certificate and my mom made me frame it.
00:47:04.446,00:47:09.535,"I have never been in love, no girl broke this heart."
00:47:10.327,00:47:13.997,Seems my life is over before it could start.
00:47:15.082,00:47:17.626,"If you find this message, please do not weep."
00:47:17.709,00:47:21.380,I'm just a particle of space dust you don't have to keep.
00:47:23.799,00:47:28.428,"I was gonna do the whole miles to go before I sleep thing, but-- Shut up."
00:47:49.533,00:47:52.744,Can you tell me which direction the Robinsons' Jupiter is from here?
00:47:52.828,00:47:54.788,North. About half a mile.
00:47:55.956,00:47:56.957,Thanks.
00:47:58.542,00:48:00.711,-You're walking? -Yeah.
00:48:01.128,00:48:03.297,Do you have something to protect yourself?
00:48:03.672,00:48:06.174,"Yeah, I do."
00:48:30.365,00:48:32.117,How's your foot? Getting tired yet?
00:48:32.200,00:48:35.370,Not tired enough to keep me from kicking your ass when this is over.
00:48:36.747,00:48:39.124,Go back to the part where we're friends again?
00:48:39.916,00:48:43.253,"West, I don't know how much longer these are going to hold."
00:48:43.337,00:48:46.590,"Go inside and tell Aiko we need to disconnect now, while we still can."
00:48:46.673,00:48:48.050,"Aye, aye, Captain."
00:48:49.801,00:48:51.053,Pretty sure we are.
00:48:51.136,00:48:52.095,"West, let's go!"
00:48:53.388,00:48:54.723,You okay in there?
00:48:56.266,00:48:58.018,Yeah. You?
00:48:58.101,00:49:00.062,I'm not sure how much more I got.
00:49:00.145,00:49:01.480,Engine's running high.
00:49:01.563,00:49:04.191,"Just hold on, okay? Don's pulling everyone out."
00:49:14.868,00:49:16.453,Cool. See you topside.
00:50:35.365,00:50:36.700,Son of a bitch.
00:50:47.753,00:50:50.130,We're losing the Jupiter. Prepare to detach.
00:50:50.213,00:50:52.632,-We need to do it simultaneously. -What?
00:50:52.716,00:50:54.801,"Judy, you won't believe what I found."
00:51:01.057,00:51:05.604,"Detach on three. One, two..."
00:51:05.687,00:51:06.521,No! No!
00:51:06.605,00:51:08.774,...three! Detach!
00:51:13.570,00:51:14.821,Whoa!
00:51:14.905,00:51:16.490,"No, no, no!"
00:51:27.250,00:51:29.169,"-Judy, what the hell are you doing? -Robinson!"
00:51:29.252,00:51:30.921,West is inside.
00:51:32.172,00:51:33.340,"Don, I can't hold it!"
00:51:33.423,00:51:35.425,"-You need to detach now, Judy! -No!"
00:51:35.509,00:51:36.510,Then I'll do it for you.
00:51:36.593,00:52:05.997,"Don, no-- No."
00:52:15.048,00:52:16.508,He sacrificed for all of us.
00:52:27.018,00:52:27.853,West?
00:52:32.983,00:52:37.112,"See, I knew she was too much of a goody-goody to do it herself."
00:52:37.195,00:52:42.576,"And frankly, I was tired of getting yelled at and blamed."
00:52:42.659,00:52:47.455,"I don't wanna have to be responsible for the Chariot going over, so..."
00:52:47.831,00:52:48.748,Just gonna...
00:52:51.293,00:52:53.670,"'Cause I'm a badass, princess."
00:53:01.386,00:53:04.306,"No, no, no. There's a comma."
00:53:07.142,00:53:08.476,"Yeah, whatever you say."
00:53:08.560,00:53:10.687,"Yeah, oh, you're welcome, by the way."
00:53:15.609,00:53:16.818,Thank you.
00:53:41.343,00:53:43.094,"Oh, um... Hi, Mom."
00:53:43.178,00:53:46.222,Hey. Where have you been?
00:53:46.598,00:53:47.641,Just hanging out.
00:53:51.978,00:53:53.063,Penny...
00:53:55.148,00:53:56.149,He seems nice.
00:54:08.078,00:54:09.955,"Yes, Judy, hi. Go ahead."
00:54:17.587,00:54:20.173,"Yes, yes. I'm... I'm..."
00:54:21.299,00:54:23.301,"I'm good. I'm wonderful, actually."
00:54:23.802,00:54:28.265,"Okay. Victor thinks it's too late to trek home, so we're gonna spend the night. I just wanted to let you know."
00:54:28.348,00:54:30.350,Okay. Just get back safe.
00:54:35.021,00:54:36.731,"I love you, too, honey."
00:54:38.692,00:54:42.237,Judy... great job.
00:54:45.615,00:54:47.492,"Thanks, Mom. Bye."
00:54:56.209,00:54:57.043,What is it?
00:54:58.336,00:54:59.546,We're gonna be okay.
00:55:05.844,00:55:09.848,"Five, five, five. Five. Okay."
00:55:09.931,00:55:13.226,"So, what you're trying to do is, you're trying to make pairs."
00:55:13.310,00:55:16.938,So you have to ask the other players if they have any of the cards you need.
00:55:24.988,00:55:27.490,Seriously? Do you ever play fair?
00:55:27.574,00:55:30.452,I am so sorry that I have excellent peripheral vision.
00:55:31.286,00:55:33.705,"Hey, Smith, should we deal you in?"
00:55:49.471,00:55:51.639,Why don't you ask your mom to join?
00:55:52.682,00:55:55.769,She's busy. Said she had to do some calculations.
00:55:58.897,00:56:03.276,And when does she ever have the time to just sit and play with you guys?
00:56:13.661,00:56:16.456,"Hey, don't worry. He'll be back."
00:56:21.795,00:56:23.463,I've never seen him make that face before.
00:56:41.523,00:56:44.734,"Hey, Angela. What can I do for you?"
00:56:53.618,00:56:55.578,Why don't we go talk outside?
00:57:00.667,00:57:03.837,You're doing what you think is best to protect your family.
00:57:05.672,00:57:10.635,"I'm happy to discuss this with you, after my daughter has left the room."
00:57:10.718,00:57:12.846,"Dad, no."
00:57:16.307,00:57:18.184,put the weapon down.
00:57:18.726,00:57:20.728,That's exactly why I'm here.
00:57:24.023,00:57:27.569,To put the weapon down.
00:57:27.652,00:57:31.448,"Robot, leave the Jupiter."
00:57:38.413,00:57:40.290,We're all playing Go Fish. You wanna come?
00:57:41.166,00:57:43.376,"Oh, honey, I'd love to but I've got to..."
00:57:44.752,00:57:45.879,You know what? I'd love to.
00:57:46.629,00:57:48.006,"Great, I'll deal ya."
00:58:03.062,00:58:04.063,Will!
00:58:32.342,00:58:33.176,No!
00:58:58.535,00:59:01.913,A very hard head is one of your dad's finest qualities.
00:59:04.874,00:59:06.376,He'll be all right.
00:59:06.793,00:59:09.462,Judy will check in on him when she gets back tomorrow.
00:59:10.338,00:59:11.923,He just needs some rest.
00:59:42.829,00:59:43.830,Come on.
00:59:53.256,00:59:56.301,I had even more proof in my hand.
00:59:56.384,01:00:00.013,"Photographs, diplomas. Pictures of the man with his family."
01:00:00.096,01:00:01.389,Wearing the St. Christopher necklace.
01:00:01.472,01:00:03.808,-So why would she-- -I don't know.
01:00:03.891,01:00:05.018,But one thing's for damn sure.
01:00:05.101,01:00:07.895,You don't go through this much trouble unless you have something to hide.
01:00:14.444,01:00:16.237,"Don't worry, Angela."
01:00:17.947,01:00:20.658,No one will blame you for what happened.
01:00:21.534,01:00:23.536,It's all gonna work out fine.
01:00:42.388,01:00:43.473,Hey.
01:00:48.561,01:00:50.438,It's okay. Everything's okay.
01:00:53.733,01:00:54.734,Where's Will?
01:01:26.265,01:01:27.975,You're the best friend I ever had.
01:01:30.395,01:01:34.023,"You know that, right?"
01:01:52.667,01:01:54.669,I have to be responsible for you.
00:01:28.505,00:01:29.672,Unbelievable.
00:01:32.425,00:01:33.510,I should have known.
00:01:33.593,00:01:36.346,She played me even before we crashed here.
00:01:36.805,00:01:38.598,I fell for it like a sucker.
00:01:40.391,00:01:42.060,I blame my innate sense of compassion.
00:01:43.019,00:01:45.396,You tried to profit off of our survival.
00:01:46.189,00:01:47.357,Nothing illegal about that.
00:01:47.440,00:01:48.817,You also smuggle booze.
00:01:48.900,00:01:50.652,How did this become about me?
00:01:51.611,00:01:55.865,"Look, the point is I use my own name. I didn't steal it off some guy."
00:01:57.283,00:01:59.953,Wonder what happened to him. The real Dr. Smith.
00:02:03.164,00:02:06.417,"Anyone else feel that? It was a tremor, I think."
00:02:06.835,00:02:07.710,I'm calling home.
00:02:10.839,00:02:12.257,No one's listening to me.
00:02:12.340,00:02:14.884,Here's my expert opinion on someone who's been busted once or twice.
00:02:15.844,00:02:19.639,A person like fake Dr. Smith needs to be confronted face-to-face.
00:02:19.722,00:02:21.975,You look her in the eye and you dare her to lie again.
00:02:23.351,00:02:24.936,No. What did I just say?
00:02:25.603,00:02:27.856,C-11 to Jupiter 2. Is anybody there?
00:02:32.861,00:02:35.280,"C-11 to Jupiter 2. Are you there, Mom?"
00:02:48.585,00:02:49.794,It's Dr. Smith.
00:02:51.087,00:02:53.423,"Yeah, I know who you are."
00:02:56.217,00:02:57.427,Is everything all right?
00:02:59.137,00:03:01.556,"We're great. Can you put my mom on, please?"
00:03:05.351,00:03:08.479,Her door's closed. Would you like me to leave her a message?
00:03:09.439,00:03:11.024,"No, I'll tell her myself. Thank you."
00:03:13.776,00:03:15.486,Could you be more suspicious?
00:03:15.570,00:03:17.697,"She's been staying in our Jupiter, eating at our table."
00:03:17.780,00:03:19.073,I even loaned her moisturizer.
00:03:24.287,00:03:26.998,-What if she tries something? -Relax.
00:03:28.166,00:03:31.836,Your mom can handle any version of Dr. Smith.
00:03:33.880,00:03:36.966,I take full responsibility for what happened.
00:03:37.550,00:03:39.302,I should've read the signs.
00:03:39.886,00:03:41.679,Angela was in such despair.
00:03:41.888,00:03:44.515,She kept reliving the attack over and over again.
00:03:44.599,00:03:45.934,She was so helpless.
00:03:46.017,00:03:48.937,Couldn't have known she'd have the means to act on her feelings.
00:03:58.363,00:04:02.533,R-3940. That's our watermark.
00:04:04.244,00:04:07.121,This gun wasn't smuggled here from Earth. It was made on our printer.
00:04:07.830,00:04:08.957,By who?
00:04:11.876,00:04:13.211,I told you it wasn't me.
00:04:16.673,00:04:19.259,What? Why would he do that?
00:04:19.759,00:04:20.718,For me.
00:04:22.136,00:04:25.556,"I was scared, and I guess he thought it was what I wanted."
00:04:25.640,00:04:26.724,You knew about this?
00:04:26.808,00:04:29.686,I'm sorry. I... I didn't want it.
00:04:32.397,00:04:33.439,So I hid it.
00:04:34.107,00:04:35.400,Where?
00:04:44.200,00:04:47.370,"Someone found it, but it wasn't her. She wasn't working on the light tower."
00:04:47.453,00:04:48.538,She was still laid up.
00:04:48.621,00:04:50.623,That just leaves everyone else.
00:04:51.124,00:04:53.543,The whole camp came aboard at one time or another.
00:04:55.545,00:04:58.840,"Hey, why don't you go get a snack?"
00:05:06.681,00:05:11.936,Why would someone give Angela a gun? It shows particularly poor judgment.
00:05:12.020,00:05:15.398,"To give a troubled woman a weapon, when it was clear what she would do."
00:05:16.357,00:05:17.400,"Uh, I..."
00:05:17.483,00:05:24.324,I thought it was strange that... that he was lingering around the quarters when there was so much work to be done elsewhere.
00:05:27.452,00:05:30.538,He wasn't exactly a fan of the robot at the meeting.
00:05:30.621,00:05:31.497,I don't know.
00:05:36.461,00:05:39.339,You'd be surprised what a man will do to protect his family.
00:05:43.384,00:05:46.637,"If we're gonna find out who gave Angela the gun, we need to go and talk to her."
00:05:47.388,00:05:49.724,Just please be gentle with her.
00:05:51.184,00:05:52.935,Angela is in a fragile place.
00:05:54.729,00:05:57.774,She wasn't too fragile to put three bullet holes in my ship.
00:06:14.874,00:06:15.833,No sneaking off.
00:06:16.793,00:06:19.253,"Really? 'Cause it's kind of, like, my thing."
00:06:19.754,00:06:20.963,I'm serious.
00:06:21.547,00:06:24.425,I don't need to tell you that your brother's going through a hard time.
00:07:00.545,00:07:03.089,"-We should switch. -No, I'm fine."
00:07:04.674,00:07:06.384,"You probably have a concussion, too."
00:07:22.024,00:07:25.111,I'm not arguing. Would you like me to argue?
00:07:38.916,00:07:40.042,I don't know.
00:07:48.426,00:07:49.969,-John! -Hold on.
00:07:57.477,00:07:58.478,"Go, go, go!"
00:08:37.225,00:08:39.560,"Okay, let's get out of here."
00:09:03.042,00:09:03.960,Ugh.
00:09:04.544,00:09:05.586,Tar.
00:09:07.255,00:09:08.714,"Tar pit, actually."
00:09:27.567,00:09:28.651,We'll be fine.
00:09:29.193,00:09:32.947,"I mean, this is hardly the worst situation we've ever been in, right?"
00:09:47.336,00:09:49.380,"Well, we're not going back this way."
00:09:50.840,00:09:52.675,There's only one way we can go.
00:10:01.892,00:10:04.103,It's remarkably predictable.
00:10:04.854,00:10:06.397,It's better than Old Faithful.
00:10:08.274,00:10:11.068,gives us three minutes and 27 seconds to get across.
00:10:13.988,00:10:20.119,"We can't go at top speed. We're lugging 3,000 gallons of fuel which weighs, conservatively, 9,000 pounds."
00:10:20.202,00:10:23.080,"That'll be what, 35 miles an hour to go how far?"
00:10:25.916,00:10:27.293,1.78 miles.
00:10:27.877,00:10:29.295,1.78 miles.
00:10:30.671,00:10:31.839,We don't have a choice.
00:11:07.124,00:11:09.460,"The second they stop, we drive like hell."
00:11:25.184,00:11:26.018,Now!
00:11:53.796,00:11:55.089,Three minutes left.
00:11:58.843,00:12:00.010,"Come on, baby."
00:12:00.094,00:12:03.597,"Please, if anything breaks, I'll fix it, but get us across the finish line, okay?"
00:12:11.605,00:12:13.441,It's more than enough. We're on pace.
00:12:27.621,00:12:29.165,My brakes are seizing up.
00:12:30.624,00:12:31.917,Why are they slowing down?
00:12:38.174,00:12:41.010,"Hey, your control cable's loose. I can see it from here."
00:12:41.635,00:12:43.137,"Two minutes, 30 seconds."
00:12:43.220,00:12:45.389,-I can't maintain this speed. -You have to.
00:12:47.933,00:12:49.852,-I'm on it. -Where are you going?
00:12:50.269,00:12:52.480,The roof. Just keep driving.
00:12:56.358,00:12:57.193,Good luck.
00:13:02.740,00:13:04.658,-Hold it steady. -Yeah.
00:13:13.292,00:13:15.503,"-Evan, be careful, please. -Two minutes."
00:13:15.586,00:13:18.506,"Dude, I'm a surfer."
00:13:24.720,00:13:26.889,"Come on. Come on, Evan."
00:13:29.475,00:13:30.935,"One minute, 30 seconds."
00:13:37.149,00:13:40.402,"Evan... Okay. Careful, careful, careful, please."
00:13:42.821,00:13:44.198,"Come on, Evan."
00:13:45.407,00:13:47.076,"Dude's got big marbles, I'll give him that."
00:14:02.132,00:14:03.425,Forty-five seconds.
00:14:20.317,00:14:21.861,Not out of the woods yet. Come on.
00:14:26.782,00:14:27.825,Fifteen.
00:14:33.873,00:14:34.915,We're almost clear.
00:14:39.169,00:14:49.305,"Five, four, three, two-- Where'd he go? Where'd he go?"
00:14:53.642,00:14:55.060,Open the door.
00:15:03.152,00:15:05.195,Move! Move! Move!
00:15:07.740,00:15:11.035,"Hey, hey, I'm here to take care of you, okay? Okay."
00:15:14.330,00:15:17.333,"His pulse is weak. Okay, I need something for the pain."
00:15:17.416,00:15:19.376,-Hold his head and neck still. -Okay.
00:15:21.587,00:15:23.464,-We need to move the tank now. -Do it.
00:15:23.547,00:15:26.383,"Grab the sling, attach it to the tank. I'll pull the Chariot into position."
00:15:26.467,00:15:27.509,Let's go.
00:15:44.068,00:15:47.613,Wait. Wait. This isn't gonna work.
00:15:47.947,00:15:48.948,Why?
00:15:49.406,00:15:51.825,The tank has landed on a rock. It's stuck in like a plug.
00:15:51.909,00:15:53.160,We've got to find another way.
00:15:56.789,00:15:58.499,I just need an inch. We can slide him out.
00:15:58.582,00:16:01.460,"The tank's pressurized. If we lift it, we're gonna lose the fuel."
00:16:03.379,00:16:06.382,Radio the Jupiters. Have them send a replacement tanker.
00:16:06.465,00:16:07.967,-Right away. -Can siphon off the fuel.
00:16:08.050,00:16:09.426,It'll take them hours to get here.
00:16:09.510,00:16:12.429,He'll go into renal failure by then. We need to move the tank.
00:16:12.513,00:16:15.432,This is a horrible situation. But we trained for this when we signed up.
00:16:15.516,00:16:17.393,Let's not let emotions dictate what we do next.
00:16:17.476,00:16:19.061,This isn't about my emotions.
00:16:19.144,00:16:21.313,"Judy, how many patients have you actually treated?"
00:16:21.397,00:16:23.899,Ones where you weren't supervised by a real doctor?
00:16:28.028,00:16:28.862,Two.
00:16:28.946,00:16:33.742,"-And one of those was your mother, right? -Yes, but-- I think you're doing the best you can, and I commend you for that."
00:16:34.368,00:16:36.495,I wanna help Evan and I'm gonna help him.
00:16:36.578,00:16:40.416,"But that fuel could save your family. Save his family, right?"
00:16:43.836,00:16:45.212,Send for that replacement tanker.
00:16:47.715,00:16:49.717,Let's find a container to catch the leaking fuel.
00:16:49.800,00:16:51.719,We won't waste a drop if we don't have to.
00:16:52.428,00:16:54.471,Let's check these hose couplings haven't been damaged.
00:16:55.180,00:16:56.807,"Beckert, move the tank."
00:16:56.890,00:16:58.392,"-Judy, calm down. -Don't touch me."
00:16:58.475,00:17:01.020,-I'm not losing that fuel. -And I'm not losing him.
00:17:01.437,00:17:03.272,He stopped breathing! Judy!
00:17:09.319,00:17:12.823,"One, two, three... Somebody move the tank!"
00:17:13.574,00:17:15.159,I'm sorry! No!
00:17:15.242,00:17:17.578,"One, two, three... Don?"
00:17:18.620,00:17:20.456,"One, two, three..."
00:17:20.539,00:17:22.041,"Ah, damn it."
00:17:22.624,00:17:24.126,"You do it, you can forget that money."
00:17:24.209,00:17:26.003,"Yeah, well, you're an asshole."
00:17:31.675,00:17:35.304,"Evan? Evan? Evan, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay."
00:17:35.387,00:17:37.556,Look at me. Look at me. It's okay.
00:18:13.967,00:18:15.677,Am I gonna die?
00:18:16.261,00:18:17.471,Not today.
00:18:24.853,00:18:26.730,"Vijay, it's me."
00:18:26.814,00:18:29.358,"You can sound less like mission control, you know."
00:18:41.537,00:18:43.372,"Hey, how you doing in there?"
00:18:46.542,00:18:49.837,"Great, thank you. Good to hear. Um, I'm sneaking out now."
00:20:13.962,00:20:16.506,Come on. Nothing?
00:20:17.507,00:20:20.677,"Maybe, like, a chuckle? A chortle?"
00:20:21.011,00:20:22.346,I thought you left.
00:20:36.777,00:20:38.779,"Haven't you already built, like, three of these?"
00:20:38.862,00:20:40.989,Can't you just leave me alone?
00:20:42.366,00:20:45.702,"Okay. Fine, whatever. I just, um..."
00:20:46.703,00:20:49.039,I thought maybe you would like to learn how to fly.
00:20:54.878,00:20:56.171,Whoo!
00:20:58.548,00:21:02.219,This is so dangerous!
00:21:06.890,00:21:07.724,Yeah!
00:21:15.482,00:21:17.025,Yeah!
00:21:42.175,00:21:43.176,You good?
00:21:46.638,00:21:48.056,Yes!
00:21:55.605,00:21:56.857,I think I'm done.
00:21:57.357,00:22:00.610,"No, come on. We gotta beat your record. What are you doing?"
00:22:00.694,00:22:01.737,"Thanks, Penny."
00:22:03.071,00:22:06.116,But... I think I'm done.
00:22:07.659,00:22:08.785,This was fun.
00:22:29.139,00:22:33.477,"Sorry you had to be broken apart like this, but, uh, I'll get you back together."
00:22:34.853,00:22:37.481,I know you can't hear me. I'm not crazy.
00:22:39.566,00:22:49.242,"It's just, when you spend so long pretending to be something you're not, sometimes you have to say things out loud to remind yourself of what's true."
00:22:53.914,00:22:55.457,My name's not Smith.
00:22:56.541,00:22:59.169,It's June Harris.
00:23:13.058,00:23:15.018,I wanna put the past behind me...
00:23:16.478,00:23:20.607,"and have a fresh start, just like them."
00:23:28.281,00:23:30.784,I'm going to be a productive member of the colony.
00:23:36.581,00:23:41.169,"Unless Captain Radic, up at the Resolute, tosses me out of the airlock first."
00:23:48.385,00:23:50.637,that Radic can't seem to understand...
00:23:51.930,00:23:56.101,is that... is that I'm a good person.
00:23:59.020,00:24:00.689,I'm not a violent person.
00:24:02.649,00:24:06.319,"I'm not a killer, like you."
00:24:07.487,00:24:08.989,You were made to kill.
00:24:14.161,00:24:21.376,The truth is that I'm not going to do any of the bad things that are going to happen.
00:24:23.837,00:24:24.880,You are.
00:24:33.889,00:24:35.557,You sure it's back here?
00:24:38.268,00:24:39.686,Uh-huh.
00:24:42.772,00:24:43.732,Please be in here.
00:24:48.528,00:24:49.362,Yes!
00:24:50.989,00:24:53.700,Great. Okay. Now...
00:25:01.166,00:25:02.167,You fix it?
00:25:06.046,00:25:08.757,Sorry. I thought maybe someone would hear us.
00:25:12.510,00:25:14.387,"Well, we've got a problem with the antenna."
00:25:14.471,00:25:15.722,Hmm? What?
00:25:16.348,00:25:17.557,It's out there.
00:25:18.475,00:25:19.976,On the shore.
00:25:20.060,00:25:23.939,You sheared it off when you off-roaded backwards through the forest.
00:25:26.775,00:25:27.859,Very impressively.
00:25:34.991,00:25:36.368,You got some flex?
00:25:50.840,00:25:54.427,Of all the times for Penny to agree to stay in the Jupiter and not come looking for us.
00:25:54.511,00:26:02.519,"Yeah. When we get back, gonna have to have a serious talk about the importance of knowing when not to obey your parents."
00:26:09.901,00:26:12.237,"Pass it up to me, okay?"
00:26:17.951,00:26:19.494,"Well, we're still sinking."
00:26:56.364,00:26:57.532,Damn.
00:27:00.535,00:27:02.996,Didn't you guys practice these sort of things?
00:27:03.330,00:27:05.707,"Uh, just you watch."
00:27:05.790,00:27:07.042,Just warming up.
00:27:12.672,00:27:14.132,-Okay. -John.
00:27:14.215,00:27:15.300,You watching?
00:27:16.134,00:27:17.093,John.
00:27:20.096,00:27:21.348,John!
00:27:26.311,00:27:28.313,"-John, get in. -What?"
00:27:28.396,00:27:29.981,It's too late. Get in.
00:27:31.858,00:27:33.401,-Damn. -Come on.
00:27:33.485,00:27:34.819,Damn it.
00:28:00.970,00:28:02.514,How much fuel did we lose?
00:28:04.099,00:28:06.768,I don't know. It doesn't matter.
00:28:10.230,00:28:13.024,Is it too soon to ask if I'll ever walk again?
00:28:15.068,00:28:18.488,"As soon we get back, I'll be able to properly examine you."
00:28:22.909,00:28:24.160,It's okay.
00:28:24.953,00:28:27.455,I know an engineer who designs prosthetics.
00:28:28.748,00:28:30.792,She could print me a bitchin' pair of legs.
00:28:34.087,00:28:35.588,"Well, you can teach me to surf."
00:28:49.060,00:28:50.186,You saved his life.
00:28:52.605,00:28:54.607,All I did was hit the gas pedal.
00:28:57.152,00:28:58.862,I'm sorry about your money.
00:29:15.795,00:29:18.256,Do we have enough fuel to get us off the planet?
00:29:19.799,00:29:20.800,Not everyone.
00:29:46.326,00:29:48.661,"So, what can I do to help?"
00:29:51.122,00:29:52.999,You hate building models.
00:29:53.082,00:29:57.253,"Yeah, 'cause it's boring and tedious. I'm willing to give it a try."
00:29:58.379,00:30:04.719,"Okay. Um, Release the main L body panel from parts sheet A."
00:30:04.803,00:30:08.932,Fold a crease in each of the six vertical hinges in the part.
00:30:10.391,00:30:12.227,"Okay, well, no wonder it's taking you so long."
00:30:12.310,00:30:14.103,You're putting the wrong pieces together.
00:30:35.416,00:30:37.293,It's okay to miss him.
00:30:38.962,00:30:40.713,"He was my friend, too."
00:30:49.430,00:30:53.726,"So, are we just making this up as we go along, or is there a method to this madness?"
00:30:56.688,00:30:58.231,"Yeah. Yeah, um..."
00:30:59.607,00:31:01.526,Thought we could use these as his hands.
00:31:01.609,00:31:06.573,"Yes, I like that. But we need something big."
00:31:18.543,00:31:20.503,"Come on, fuse together."
00:31:36.895,00:31:38.521,What else do you need from me?
00:31:47.572,00:31:50.950,-Is this gonna work? -In principle.
00:31:51.910,00:31:55.622,The line you threw to the tree is conductive.
00:31:56.497,00:31:58.374,"Oh, God, this heat."
00:31:59.626,00:32:05.798,"So, it should act as an antenna if we can make an unbroken connection for the signal."
00:32:33.034,00:32:35.828,-You know what this reminds me of? -What?
00:32:35.912,00:32:38.539,That apartment we had in Glendale with the broken AC.
00:32:46.506,00:32:49.217,wandering around that mall just trying to keep cool?
00:32:54.889,00:32:58.768,"Hey, you have a Ph.D in Engineering. Why did you never fix the AC?"
00:32:59.644,00:33:02.939,Kids liked the pretzels. We were having fun.
00:33:04.983,00:33:06.150,Huh.
00:33:16.369,00:33:17.662,"You know, when..."
00:33:22.834,00:33:25.753,and I went and re-upped...
00:33:28.047,00:33:30.383,-You don't have to. -I thought it was the right thing to do.
00:33:30.466,00:33:32.468,"Yeah, well, you made that clear at the time."
00:33:32.552,00:33:33.803,"Well, I was wrong."
00:33:37.890,00:33:38.891,I regret it.
00:33:41.686,00:33:42.687,You know...
00:33:44.439,00:33:49.694,"some things you learn over time and some things, you have to be kicked in the face."
00:33:53.239,00:33:57.118,And when you called and you told me that you were taking the kids...
00:33:58.995,00:34:00.496,to start a new life...
00:34:06.544,00:34:07.712,that's when I knew.
00:34:13.342,00:34:14.218,Hey.
00:34:16.429,00:34:18.514,"Hey, I'm sorry. Did I say something wrong?"
00:34:27.940,00:34:36.532,"I wanted to go to space so bad, and I couldn't imagine us staying on Earth the way it was."
00:34:39.535,00:34:42.663,"He tried so hard, but he... he couldn't do it."
00:34:44.457,00:34:45.333,Will?
00:34:47.376,00:34:48.878,He failed the test.
00:34:52.298,00:34:53.716,I don't understand.
00:34:56.135,00:34:58.930,I cheated to get him on the Resolute.
00:35:01.182,00:35:04.310,"If it wasn't for me, none of us would be stranded here."
00:35:05.853,00:35:06.854,Hey.
00:35:10.608,00:35:12.860,You wanted a better life for our kids.
00:35:15.154,00:35:19.992,"You did what any mother would've wanted to do, but only you could do."
00:35:45.852,00:35:49.814,"Middle of three boys, huh? Must've been pretty wild in your house."
00:35:49.897,00:35:50.857,Yeah.
00:35:51.524,00:35:53.359,Fridge was always bare.
00:35:54.402,00:35:57.655,And wrestling matches for the remote. The usual.
00:35:58.281,00:36:00.032,Are you close to your siblings?
00:36:06.789,00:36:11.335,"Phil, he's already at the colony with his horrible wife."
00:36:23.514,00:36:26.976,Can you turn down the air? It's kind of cold in here.
00:36:34.525,00:36:36.986,"All right, he's going into shock. I need a blanket."
00:36:55.338,00:36:57.465,Okay. Okay.
00:36:58.799,00:36:59.634,Okay.
00:37:02.011,00:37:03.471,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:37:14.732,00:37:16.651,Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
00:37:18.778,00:37:19.904,"Come on, Evan. Come on, Evan."
00:37:22.698,00:37:24.909,"No, no, no, no, no, no. Evan."
00:37:24.992,00:37:26.535,All right. All right. All right.
00:38:17.962,00:38:19.130,What is it?
00:38:26.512,00:38:27.722,Evan's dead.
00:38:42.320,00:38:44.864,We sacrificed the fuel for nothing.
00:39:17.897,00:39:23.569,"I'll, uh, just find another power source to hook the radio up to."
00:39:35.706,00:39:36.540,Maureen.
00:39:38.667,00:39:39.668,Maureen.
00:39:41.253,00:39:42.171,So?
00:39:45.549,00:39:48.260,"If it can handle space, it can handle a little tar."
00:39:49.887,00:39:52.473,-There's only one of them. -Yeah.
00:39:55.351,00:39:57.853,I am fixing the radio. Stop distracting me.
00:39:57.937,00:39:59.397,"Maureen, listen to me."
00:39:59.855,00:40:02.233,How long have we been rebreathing this air?
00:40:02.316,00:40:07.655,"I mean, soon there's gonna be too much carbon dioxide, and then we'll pass out. And if we pass out, we die."
00:40:07.738,00:40:10.616,-John. -I'll open the hatch and you can get out.
00:40:10.699,00:40:13.911,"If you open the hatch, the Chariot will fill with tar."
00:40:13.994,00:40:15.413,You won't survive.
00:40:15.746,00:40:16.914,But you will.
00:40:18.749,00:40:21.252,"-I'm not doing it. -Yeah, you are."
00:40:23.045,00:40:26.215,I'm not giving up. Since when are you?
00:40:26.507,00:40:30.636,This isn't giving up. This is saving your life.
00:40:32.888,00:40:33.806,No.
00:40:34.723,00:40:35.766,Maureen.
00:40:37.226,00:40:39.061,You put this suit on.
00:40:39.145,00:40:40.896,You go get our kids.
00:40:41.647,00:40:43.357,And you get 'em off this planet.
00:40:45.651,00:40:46.735,All right?
00:40:49.655,00:40:50.656,All right?
00:41:40.289,00:41:42.333,you're gonna be hit by a ton of weight from the tar.
00:41:42.416,00:41:45.669,I'll get underneath you and do the best I can to help you out.
00:41:51.342,00:41:54.053,"Hey. Yes, you can."
00:41:54.637,00:41:55.638,"Yes, you can."
00:41:57.056,00:42:00.643,"You are the strongest, most fearless person I know."
00:42:02.645,00:42:05.898,I wish I hadn't spent so much time being angry at you.
00:42:07.274,00:42:10.277,I wish we could walk around that mall one last time.
00:42:12.154,00:42:13.155,Maureen...
00:42:15.074,00:42:16.075,I love you.
00:42:19.828,00:42:21.789,Let's do it. It's time.
00:42:37.346,00:42:39.098,"Okay, listen."
00:42:41.225,00:42:44.728,"When I open the hatch, you go like there's fire under your ass."
00:42:44.812,00:42:46.981,And you don't look back. Okay?
00:42:47.064,00:42:48.274,Come on. Come on.
00:42:58.158,00:43:00.035,"Wait, stop. Stop."
00:43:01.370,00:43:02.705,-What is it? -Take this off.
00:43:06.375,00:43:07.209,What?
00:43:09.128,00:43:12.590,"If we can create enough pressure in here, we could displace the tar."
00:43:13.048,00:43:16.093,-Displace it with what? -The helium. From the HAB.
00:43:23.017,00:43:25.102,but we're still stuck in the middle of a pit.
00:43:25.185,00:43:29.148,You remember when Penny was two and we bought her that... that play tunnel...
00:43:29.231,00:43:31.692,-Yeah. Uh-huh. -...that she could crawl around in?
00:43:31.775,00:43:33.360,That's what we're gonna do with the balloon.
00:43:33.736,00:43:35.362,Our body weight will carry us down.
00:43:35.446,00:43:37.573,We can crawl along the bottom until we reach the shore.
00:43:37.656,00:43:39.325,Can't believe I didn't think of it before.
00:46:15.439,00:46:17.065,I'll take the tanker back to my Jupiter.
00:46:17.149,00:46:19.526,We can reconvene in the morning and go over options.
00:46:20.319,00:46:21.653,Copy.
00:46:34.374,00:46:36.251,I really thought I could save him.
00:46:36.919,00:46:39.463,"You did everything you could, Dr. Robinson."
00:46:46.470,00:46:49.056,I have to go tell his brother what happened to him.
00:46:49.973,00:46:51.058,I'll drive you.
00:47:12.996,00:47:14.957,I knew you'd make it back safely.
00:47:15.040,00:47:16.917,I'm so glad to see you.
00:47:24.967,00:47:25.884,Victor?
00:47:28.345,00:47:31.181,Everything's going to be okay. I promise.
00:47:36.603,00:47:37.938,"We had it, son."
00:47:39.940,00:47:41.191,More than enough.
00:47:41.275,00:47:42.276,What happened?
00:47:44.236,00:47:46.863,There was an accident. We lost it all.
00:47:49.116,00:47:50.284,Almost all.
00:47:53.537,00:47:55.956,We're just gonna have to stay here a little longer now.
00:47:56.331,00:47:57.749,How... How much longer?
00:47:58.375,00:48:02.337,I don't know. We're stuck here until we figure it out.
00:48:06.842,00:48:08.802,There's something I need to tell you.
00:48:15.851,00:48:18.312,Okay. Check it out.
00:48:19.313,00:48:20.355,Mini Will.
00:48:21.189,00:48:23.525,-Is that supposed to be me? -Well...
00:48:28.614,00:48:30.198,But it's so good.
00:48:31.491,00:48:33.744,Would you honestly eat your own brother?
00:48:42.252,00:48:45.172,This is Will Robinson of the 24th Colonist Group.
00:48:46.089,00:48:55.390,I'm making a record of this because it seems I'm the first human to discover evidence of an alien intelligence.
00:48:58.936,00:49:00.812,It appears it crashed when we did.
00:49:06.902,00:49:08.528,It appears it crashed when we did.
00:49:12.741,00:49:15.327,I don't even know why we crashed.
00:49:55.867,00:49:58.412,Did she tell you how long we have before the planet dies?
00:50:01.331,00:50:02.374,No.
00:50:12.092,00:50:13.093,Vijay...
00:50:15.470,00:50:17.180,Get the Jupiter ready.
00:50:18.807,00:50:20.934,We're getting off this damn planet.
00:08:27.465,00:08:29.800,You'd be flying blind.
00:08:30.510,00:08:31.928,It's too dangerous.
00:08:32.595,00:08:33.804,No radar.
00:08:34.388,00:08:35.306,No sensors.
00:08:35.389,00:08:37.725,The computer would not be there to handle any problems.
00:08:38.684,00:08:40.770,I was trained for problems.
00:08:40.853,00:08:42.855,Think about your daughter!
00:00:15.682,00:00:17.350,"Hey, come on."
00:00:17.434,00:00:21.396,"Obviously, I memorized and studied the topography before we left."
00:00:25.900,00:00:27.277,Maybe I am.
00:00:30.780,00:00:34.826,Five bucks says the Dhars' Jupiter is over that rise. Come on.
00:00:36.578,00:00:39.414,Since when have you ever known me to gamble?
00:00:39.497,00:00:42.333,We've had our share of bets over the years.
00:00:42.417,00:00:45.003,"Yeah, but it's not gambling when I know I'm right."
00:00:45.086,00:00:47.464,Which is why I'm down 340 bucks.
00:00:48.506,00:00:50.258,"Wait, you kept track?"
00:00:54.846,00:00:56.806,"Dhars, just over that hill."
00:00:58.725,00:01:01.352,That's a Jupiter engine. Where's my five bucks?
00:01:02.645,00:01:03.897,"Wait, are they taking off?"
00:01:05.523,00:01:06.566,I don't know.
00:01:25.210,00:01:28.129,Launch will commence in T-minus three minutes.
00:01:33.051,00:01:34.010,Maureen.
00:01:37.680,00:01:40.141,There was an accident. A colonist was injured.
00:01:40.225,00:01:43.728,"In an attempt to save his life, your daughter lost nearly all the fuel we managed to recover."
00:01:44.479,00:01:46.356,What do you mean nearly all the fuel?
00:01:46.773,00:01:47.982,Commence pre-launch sequence.
00:01:58.159,00:02:02.705,"Prisha, it's important. How much fuel do you have, exactly?"
00:02:03.456,00:02:05.875,"Maureen, I promise we'll send back help."
00:02:06.793,00:02:08.086,17.3%.
00:02:09.796,00:02:13.800,Shut down the engines. You're too heavy. You won't make it out of the atmosphere.
00:02:13.883,00:02:15.176,Keep 'em talking.
00:02:28.815,00:02:29.649,Listen to me.
00:02:30.150,00:02:33.361,You will burn up all the fuel before you reach escape velocity.
00:02:35.446,00:02:37.949,-Maybe we should listen to her. -The computer says it's fine.
00:02:41.161,00:02:42.871,It's not calibrated for this planet.
00:02:43.454,00:02:46.541,You won't survive. None of you will.
00:02:55.967,00:03:01.639,"But I had to find out this planet is dying from my son, who learned it from your daughter. So forgive me for not trusting you."
00:03:55.193,00:03:56.736,Us.
00:03:58.863,00:04:01.574,"Attention, all Jupiters. This is John Robinson."
00:04:02.408,00:04:06.287,Report to Jupiter 4. We'll explain when you get here.
00:04:19.592,00:04:20.426,Hey.
00:04:24.806,00:04:26.140,Is there any way I can help?
00:04:28.810,00:04:31.813,Yeah. We only have a defined amount of fuel to provide thrust.
00:04:31.896,00:04:33.856,So we need to make the Jupiter as light as possible.
00:04:33.940,00:04:38.319,"Right. So, this is a list of everything we can strip out that isn't essential."
00:04:38.403,00:04:41.406,And this is the maximum weight we need to reach.
00:04:49.372,00:04:51.332,-It's still too heavy. -Yeah.
00:04:51.416,00:04:55.378,I wish I could strip out all of this. The cockpit alone weighs five tons.
00:04:55.461,00:04:58.965,"Technically, 9,530 pounds, but..."
00:05:00.383,00:05:01.884,Too bad you can't pilot without it.
00:05:06.514,00:05:08.266,Did I spill something on Friendship 7?
00:05:15.815,00:05:21.946,It seems that our planet is on an orbit that will bring us dangerously close to the sun.
00:05:30.038,00:05:31.289,"Well, it's too hot."
00:05:32.248,00:05:33.958,Are you saying the planet is dying?
00:05:34.834,00:05:38.921,Not dying. Just entering a phase malignant to human life.
00:05:40.965,00:05:43.217,Thank you for that clarification.
00:05:43.301,00:05:47.138,"Well, it explains why there's a rapid increase in seismic activity."
00:05:48.181,00:05:50.141,Also the spike in median temperature...
00:05:50.224,00:05:51.851,Have you seen your sister?
00:05:51.934,00:05:55.063,"Um, no. Last time I heard, she was with Evan's family."
00:05:56.647,00:05:57.565,Why?
00:05:58.274,00:06:00.818,"Uh, nothing. Just seeing if she's okay."
00:06:01.611,00:06:04.322,I don't think any of us are okay right now.
00:06:04.405,00:06:05.782,So how long do we have?
00:06:08.201,00:06:09.368,Long enough.
00:06:13.873,00:06:16.417,for one Jupiter to make it to the Resolute.
00:06:16.501,00:06:18.002,"So, whoever goes will send back help."
00:06:18.086,00:06:22.173,"But if we're gonna get this one off the ground, we're gonna have to lose things we thought we needed."
00:06:22.548,00:06:33.851,"Like... Like, the navigation system alone weighs 1.3 tons and-- but there's no reason that we have to navigate from inside the Jupiter."
00:06:33.935,00:06:38.731,"In the early days of spaceflight, NASA capsules were basically tin cans."
00:06:38.815,00:06:41.984,"Uh, all the instrumentation was handled from the ground at mission control."
00:06:44.737,00:06:49.158,...we are going to launch off this planet the old-fashioned way.
00:06:49.242,00:06:50.284,How can we...
00:06:52.662,00:06:54.705,Welcome to 1962.
00:08:12.825,00:08:16.454,"You want me to do this because I'm the best pilot here, right?"
00:08:17.038,00:08:18.664,You are the best pilot here.
00:08:19.874,00:08:23.044,Not just because I weigh 110 pounds?
00:08:24.629,00:08:26.088,That helps.
00:08:32.553,00:08:33.721,No radar.
00:08:34.180,00:08:35.348,No sensors.
00:08:35.431,00:08:37.600,The computer would not be there to handle any problems.
00:08:38.434,00:08:40.394,I was trained for problems.
00:08:40.853,00:08:42.730,Think about you daughter!
00:08:46.025,00:08:50.071,"This'll be just like the Mercury-Redstone 3, NASA's first manned mission to space."
00:08:50.154,00:08:53.616,"The first mission was number three? As in, the first two blew up?"
00:08:53.699,00:08:57.870,As in the first two were unmanned. The Jupiter still needs someone to fly it.
00:08:59.330,00:09:00.414,I trust her.
00:09:23.563,00:09:25.189,I feel like we should talk.
00:09:33.823,00:09:35.783,You promised me you weren't gonna tell.
00:09:36.951,00:09:40.705,"We sat by a waterfall, and, granted, it was mud, but whatever."
00:09:40.788,00:09:45.001,We sat there and you gave me your word that you wouldn't.
00:09:45.793,00:09:59.140,"And I know that it was a lot to lay on you, that we're all gonna die in this place, but honestly, I was scared, and I didn't know what to do, and I trusted you, which is not something I do on a regular basis."
00:10:01.100,00:10:02.101,I'm sorry.
00:10:04.020,00:10:05.021,That's it?
00:10:07.148,00:10:09.609,-I gotta go. -Are you serious?
00:10:10.109,00:10:11.193,What are you doing?
00:10:15.573,00:10:16.907,We shouldn't hang out anymore.
00:10:20.244,00:10:21.912,Are you breaking up with me?
00:10:22.747,00:10:24.165,Breaking up?
00:10:27.168,00:10:30.880,"We weren't really together or anything, were we?"
00:10:38.804,00:10:41.932,You're a bad kisser. So...
00:11:09.960,00:11:13.964,I'm trying to patch the UHF radio so this Jupiter can be linked to ours.
00:11:28.479,00:11:30.314,Yeah? What if I helped you?
00:11:31.649,00:11:32.900,Two hours.
00:11:37.321,00:11:39.699,You've been hanging out with Penny too much.
00:11:48.040,00:11:49.250,Uh...
00:11:50.835,00:11:52.795,Beckert hit me with a crowbar.
00:11:54.213,00:11:55.589,Is he okay?
00:11:56.590,00:11:58.843,"Yeah, he'll be sore in the morning."
00:12:04.306,00:12:06.725,Could you show me sometime?
00:12:07.852,00:12:09.145,Show you what?
00:12:09.228,00:12:12.565,What to do if someone tries to hit me with a crowbar.
00:12:13.274,00:12:15.484,Uh... sure.
00:12:16.485,00:12:21.282,"I mean, maybe we could start with something a little less intense. Huh?"
00:12:49.393,00:12:52.813,"Okay, great. Once we're done with those, let's start stripping the med lab."
00:12:52.897,00:12:56.025,"Mom, I'm being prompted to plug in the Dhar's security codes."
00:12:56.859,00:12:58.235,"Okay, I'll talk to Victor."
00:13:03.032,00:13:07.369,"-Okay, uh, I'll get you a ride. -Do you want me to take him?"
00:13:10.498,00:13:13.292,Unless people wanna talk about how they feel about taking this ship apart.
00:13:29.600,00:13:31.560,I need your security codes.
00:13:32.686,00:13:36.065,Why not? You've taken everything else.
00:13:38.609,00:13:42.530,"You know, I want everyone to survive as much as you do."
00:13:48.035,00:13:49.787,You put my family's lives at risk.
00:13:49.870,00:13:52.206,-I was going to get help. -I'm not talking about today.
00:13:54.041,00:13:58.003,I stood up for you. I told them you didn't have it in you.
00:13:58.087,00:14:01.090,-What are you talking about? -The gun.
00:14:01.173,00:14:03.467,The one you gave Angela.
00:14:03.551,00:14:08.514,"When your family's lives are at risk, you don't think clearly, believe me."
00:14:09.348,00:14:11.350,"And right now, you're not thinking clearly."
00:14:12.059,00:14:14.061,I had nothing to do with that business with the robot.
00:14:14.144,00:14:15.854,I suggest you look somewhere else.
00:14:26.407,00:14:29.034,"Aw, honey, I heard what happened."
00:14:30.119,00:14:32.788,There's something I need to tell you about Dr. Smith.
00:14:33.122,00:14:35.457,-What do you mean? -Where is she?
00:14:45.801,00:14:48.095,Are you gonna help or you just gonna watch?
00:14:48.470,00:14:50.347,The math doesn't add up.
00:14:50.431,00:14:52.558,"Believe me, Maureen's math always adds up."
00:14:52.641,00:14:56.687,The way the Jupiters were built on paper isn't the same as they are in real life.
00:14:56.770,00:14:58.856,There are things that only a mechanic knows.
00:14:58.939,00:14:59.773,Such as?
00:14:59.857,00:15:03.027,They were over-engineered. Redundant systems up the wazoo.
00:15:03.110,00:15:07.615,"Your wife thinks you can strip away those redundant systems, and the ones that are left will work."
00:15:07.698,00:15:09.575,"She's assuming they're perfect, but they're not."
00:15:10.034,00:15:13.037,They're just like people. They kinda just chug along...
00:15:14.204,00:15:17.207,"some missing the mark, others picking up the slack."
00:15:18.334,00:15:24.006,"I love a woman who can reroute a coolant system, but we need the whole system. And it's too heavy."
00:15:32.056,00:15:35.267,"Yeah, it's fairly important if you wanna, you know, keep living."
00:15:36.393,00:15:37.603,Huh.
00:15:46.028,00:15:47.696,-Stay here. -Be careful.
00:16:32.408,00:16:35.244,We were just bringing supplies back for everyone.
00:16:37.413,00:16:40.165,"People work better on a full stomach, right?"
00:16:43.168,00:16:44.336,I've got the codes.
00:16:44.420,00:16:48.340,They're on my laptop out in the Chariot. With Judy.
00:16:49.842,00:16:52.344,"-Judy's back? -Yeah. Go get them, okay?"
00:16:52.428,00:16:53.846,"Yeah, thanks, Mom."
00:16:56.098,00:16:59.018,You seem stressed out. Do you need to talk?
00:16:59.601,00:17:02.771,"No, I'm fine. I mean, plus or minus a few variables."
00:17:06.567,00:17:07.651,Of course.
00:17:07.735,00:17:11.238,"Okay, there's some equipment that we need down in the garage."
00:17:23.625,00:17:25.711,It's crazy what people will do when they're scared.
00:17:28.547,00:17:32.384,"Well, at least we caught him before he did any real damage."
00:17:34.845,00:17:36.972,So what is it we're looking for?
00:17:38.557,00:17:41.894,"Just, uh, anything to help strip the ship, you know?"
00:17:42.853,00:17:46.940,"Cordless drill packs, miter saws, or whatever."
00:17:47.024,00:17:50.986,You Robinsons are such a little tribe of fixer-uppers.
00:17:53.238,00:18:02.790,"I've learned more in the past few weeks about repairing engines, rewiring wires and refueling radios..."
00:18:06.001,00:18:08.670,"-Maureen, what are you doing? -Who are you?"
00:18:09.588,00:18:12.424,-You know who I am. -No. The truth.
00:18:16.053,00:18:17.096,It's complicated.
00:18:24.478,00:18:30.234,"When the Resolute was evacuated, the path to my Jupiter was cut off."
00:18:31.360,00:18:32.486,And...
00:18:33.821,00:18:38.117,"I begged anyone I could find to take me in, but they..."
00:18:39.743,00:18:44.123,And that's when I saw him. The real Dr. Smith.
00:18:45.457,00:18:46.583,He was hurt...
00:18:48.418,00:18:50.129,"he was bleeding, and I..."
00:18:53.507,00:18:59.263,"I tried to save him, but I just thought, Why should both of us have to die?"
00:19:02.683,00:19:04.726,So I took his access tag.
00:19:06.436,00:19:09.356,"I'm sorry, I should have told you sooner."
00:19:14.903,00:19:16.321,I wanted you to like me.
00:19:18.448,00:19:22.578,"-Clearly, you wanted more than that. -Just to survive."
00:19:24.496,00:19:26.331,Then why did you give Angela the gun?
00:19:27.249,00:19:31.044,"Maureen, why would I want to hurt the people-- I don't know, you tell me."
00:19:36.216,00:19:38.343,"If I'm wrong, I apologize."
00:19:38.427,00:19:43.015,"But right now, I need to protect my family, and I think the best way to do that is to keep you away from them."
00:19:46.643,00:19:48.145,Jessica Harris.
00:19:50.189,00:19:51.481,That's my name.
00:19:51.857,00:19:55.360,Look it up in the manifest. I'm a physicist.
00:19:55.444,00:19:57.154,You're a physicist?
00:19:58.822,00:20:02.201,-Why would you lie about that? -You're asking the wrong questions.
00:20:02.826,00:20:08.498,"What you should be asking is, how long was I on that Jupiter today?"
00:20:08.582,00:20:10.667,The one you're preparing to launch.
00:20:14.421,00:20:19.176,What might a woman of my expertise have done to it?
00:20:19.259,00:20:23.639,"-You're lying. -Maybe I am, maybe I'm not."
00:20:23.722,00:20:25.515,That ship is your only means of survival.
00:20:25.599,00:20:28.769,"Let's just say, for the sake of argument, that it wasn't."
00:20:29.186,00:20:34.566,If you did anything to sabotage that ship-- Here's what I suggest. You let me out. I come clean.
00:20:34.650,00:20:38.362,We both go our separate ways and call it happily ever after.
00:20:38.445,00:20:41.448,"-Go to hell. -We're already there, Maureen."
00:20:41.740,00:20:45.494,It's up to you whether or not your family makes it out before they get burned.
00:21:02.719,00:21:03.804,That checks out.
00:21:09.017,00:21:11.270,"Victor's Jupiter, you think she messed with it?"
00:21:11.353,00:21:15.023,No. I think she'd say anything to save her ass.
00:21:17.067,00:21:18.777,"No, we'll be fine."
00:21:24.658,00:21:30.998,"Don and I went over the plan. He thinks the Jupiter's still too heavy, even after stripping out everything from your list."
00:21:31.581,00:21:34.501,"-So we strip more. -Well, there's not much left."
00:21:34.584,00:21:37.671,"We're down to life support, pressure systems, -servo systems. -Servo systems."
00:21:37.754,00:21:39.715,"I mean, can it even fly without those?"
00:21:40.465,00:21:42.342,-Theoretically. -Theoretically?
00:21:52.102,00:21:55.397,-She will black out. -Yeah. She will.
00:21:55.480,00:21:57.941,There isn't a person alive who wouldn't.
00:21:58.025,00:22:02.696,"The question is, will she wake up in time to manually pilot out of the atmosphere?"
00:22:04.197,00:22:05.657,What if she can't?
00:22:16.626,00:22:17.753,Is that fast enough?
00:22:19.379,00:22:26.219,"During liftoff, the Jupiter rises at one mile per second, and it's a 70-mile trip out of this atmosphere -into the safety of space. -70 seconds."
00:22:26.303,00:22:29.806,"Oh, God, and it's a rough 70 seconds."
00:22:30.390,00:22:36.938,"The pilot will have to manually steer around atmospheric hazards, which is hard enough, but at the same time vent the engines so they don't overheat."
00:22:37.022,00:22:41.735,It's basically like threading a needle when you've just woken up from a knock-out punch.
00:22:44.279,00:22:45.781,She'll never have enough time.
00:23:01.671,00:23:07.177,Of course. Full cognitive recovery in 19 seconds.
00:23:09.179,00:23:10.806,That's 35 seconds faster.
00:23:10.889,00:23:12.474,That doesn't mean I'm the right person.
00:23:12.557,00:23:15.227,"When every second counts, 35 seconds is a lot."
00:23:15.310,00:23:16.812,-Check again. -I don't need to.
00:23:16.895,00:23:18.271,"-Maureen, listen-- -John..."
00:23:18.355,00:23:21.942,I am not leaving you and the kids. Not again.
00:23:25.779,00:23:27.030,I made a promise.
00:23:29.533,00:23:30.867,Then keep it.
00:23:33.161,00:23:34.204,How?
00:23:35.247,00:23:36.665,Come back safely.
00:23:47.968,00:23:49.094,This decision...
00:23:51.513,00:23:53.223,It can't be just ours.
00:23:56.476,00:23:58.979,"I know this isn't easy, so..."
00:24:01.314,00:24:04.776,"Look, the only way I do this is if we all talk it through."
00:24:05.777,00:24:07.362,"Okay, let's do pros and cons."
00:24:07.446,00:24:11.032,"And pro, he's the only one that can do it."
00:24:11.575,00:24:13.952,That's not a pro. He might not make it.
00:24:15.745,00:24:19.124,That's not a pro either. That's a con. They're all cons.
00:24:27.924,00:24:31.386,You sure you'll be okay? That you'll come back?
00:24:32.554,00:24:35.056,"If anyone can do this, it's your dad."
00:24:35.765,00:24:38.852,Can you promise me he'll make it back?
00:24:43.523,00:24:46.109,"If I could, we wouldn't be having this discussion."
00:24:53.700,00:24:54.993,What happens if I say no?
00:25:07.964,00:25:09.424,"Hey. Hey, Will."
00:25:10.509,00:25:11.384,Will.
00:25:18.141,00:25:19.434,Talk to me.
00:25:20.560,00:25:23.772,The robot. I let him die.
00:25:23.855,00:25:26.566,I told him it was okay to walk off the cliff.
00:25:26.650,00:25:30.028,"And now, you want me to do the same for you?"
00:25:30.904,00:25:35.033,"Will, I don't wanna do this."
00:25:35.825,00:25:37.535,But you have to?
00:25:37.619,00:25:41.957,"That's what you said three years ago, when you left."
00:25:45.168,00:25:47.087,Not gonna say it's okay for you to go.
00:25:58.807,00:26:00.725,"Hey, hey. Listen to me."
00:26:01.935,00:26:03.186,It's all right.
00:26:04.813,00:26:06.606,It's not okay with me either.
00:26:19.411,00:26:21.705,"If your dad's gonna do this, he's gonna need our help."
00:26:25.542,00:26:26.710,"Yeah, what's the second part?"
00:26:29.379,00:26:30.297,Right.
00:26:39.264,00:26:40.223,John?
00:26:42.600,00:26:46.479,"I don't know what Maureen told you, but I think the pressure..."
00:26:48.023,00:26:49.190,I think it's getting to her.
00:26:50.984,00:26:55.322,Her behavior is a clear indication of clinical anxiety disorder.
00:26:56.197,00:26:57.949,"You're wasting your breath, Jessica."
00:26:58.033,00:27:00.994,Jessica? Who's Jessica?
00:27:01.453,00:27:03.455,Is that who Maureen thinks I am?
00:27:07.167,00:27:09.711,"Let me out, and we can help her together."
00:27:11.963,00:27:15.216,Do you know why she locked me in here? Because I spoke up.
00:27:15.800,00:27:22.974,"I told her I was worried that she wasn't thinking clearly, that she might be sending Naoko to her death."
00:27:26.645,00:27:29.564,"Only it's not Naoko anymore, is it?"
00:27:31.107,00:27:34.986,"Don't get on that ship, John. I'm trying to protect you."
00:27:35.862,00:27:43.286,"You know, over the years, a lot of people have put their life in my hands."
00:27:44.245,00:27:49.542,"But if I had to trust someone with mine, I'd choose my wife."
00:27:52.128,00:27:57.884,You mean the woman who wanted to take your kids away and start a whole new life without you?
00:27:58.968,00:28:05.725,"And now she suddenly claims, let me guess, that you're the only one who can fly this Jupiter."
00:28:06.976,00:28:08.645,That's convenient.
00:28:11.481,00:28:24.077,"If I were you, I'd spend your time getting your story straight, because when we get to the Resolute, and we will get to the Resolute, it's gonna have to be a hell of a lot more convincing."
00:28:27.622,00:28:30.375,Fly safe. We're all depending on you.
00:28:36.589,00:28:38.049,You ready for a practice run?
00:28:39.592,00:28:41.845,-Good to go. -Okay.
00:28:43.596,00:28:51.604,"So, remember, the actual Jupiter that you'll be flying, all these bells and whistles, they might as well be actual bells and actual whistles for all the good they'll do you."
00:28:53.773,00:28:55.024,Is that necessary?
00:28:55.108,00:28:58.194,"You want it to be as close as possible to reality, right?"
00:28:58.278,00:28:59.904,You really gonna knock me out?
00:29:02.615,00:29:06.494,"So, we'll skip the pre-launch protocols because you wouldn't be able to execute them anyway."
00:29:06.578,00:29:09.456,You just sit back and let me do the work until it's time to launch.
00:29:09.831,00:29:12.459,"But once you're up there, only you'll be able to steer."
00:29:12.542,00:29:14.169,And vent the engines before they explode.
00:29:15.837,00:29:17.380,before you get out of the atmosphere.
00:29:17.464,00:29:19.090,And always vent them away from the sun.
00:29:19.174,00:29:21.634,And always be aware of variables. Something will go wrong.
00:29:21.968,00:29:23.094,It always does.
00:29:25.138,00:29:26.723,T-minus 30 seconds to liftoff.
00:29:37.233,00:29:38.109,Arms up.
00:29:49.412,00:29:55.835,"...five, four, three, two, one, liftoff."
00:30:05.512,00:30:08.431,"No, don't touch those. Let the SRBs carry you up."
00:30:09.307,00:30:13.019,"Okay. You're approaching 9G, where you're gonna lose consciousness."
00:30:13.102,00:30:14.771,I'm cutting your suit pressure to simulate.
00:30:15.355,00:30:19.776,Your cognitive recovery was 19 seconds. Feel free to improve on that.
00:30:32.413,00:30:33.665,Nineteen seconds.
00:30:34.290,00:30:36.543,You're nothing if not consistent. How's your head?
00:30:36.626,00:30:38.211,-Foggy. -Push through.
00:30:38.294,00:30:41.339,You're hitting tropospheric winds at ten o'clock. Roll left.
00:30:59.107,00:30:59.983,Again.
00:31:04.571,00:31:05.446,Okay.
00:31:12.245,00:31:15.456,"two, one, liftoff."
00:31:24.048,00:31:25.049,You lost a second.
00:31:26.092,00:31:29.095,"No, you can't vent towards the sun. Bank left."
00:31:31.514,00:31:32.765,"Oh, God."
00:31:34.517,00:31:37.520,"Yeah, I need a few more seconds to recover before venting."
00:31:41.649,00:31:47.697,"Five, four, three, two, one, liftoff."
00:31:54.287,00:31:56.414,Something's wrong. Your weight distribution's off.
00:31:56.497,00:31:58.207,Which means so is your trajectory.
00:31:58.291,00:31:59.459,Course correct.
00:32:00.835,00:32:02.921,You just hit the boosters way too hard.
00:32:03.254,00:32:06.466,Your brain smashed against the inside of your skull. It's swelling.
00:32:06.549,00:32:07.884,"Yeah, but I'm not dead, right?"
00:32:09.385,00:32:10.303,But now you are.
00:32:10.386,00:32:11.596,"Oh, God."
00:32:11.679,00:32:12.847,Again.
00:32:17.060,00:32:20.229,System malfunction. Engines are hot. Too hot. What do you do?
00:32:20.939,00:32:22.023,Uh...
00:32:23.983,00:32:25.944,"No, it's too late. You're dead."
00:32:27.862,00:32:29.405,-Too late. You're dead. -Oh.
00:32:36.871,00:32:39.040,-Ahhh! -You're dead.
00:32:45.505,00:32:47.215,You're dead. Again.
00:32:51.219,00:32:52.428,"Dad, are you okay?"
00:32:52.512,00:32:55.515,"Yeah, I just need, uh... I just need some more reps."
00:32:58.685,00:33:00.812,"As his doctor, I'm advising that he take a break."
00:33:01.229,00:33:04.232,His heart is at serious risk if he continues like this.
00:33:04.315,00:33:07.944,"Hey, hey. Maybe we should all take a break, huh? Huh?"
00:33:09.821,00:33:11.781,"Yeah, okay. I'll get you some water."
00:33:15.284,00:33:16.703,Can you help me take...
00:33:33.302,00:33:34.512,Yeah.
00:33:50.653,00:33:54.073,I would be worried about you making it even if she hadn't said anything.
00:33:54.824,00:33:56.909,Why don't we take a couple of extra days?
00:33:59.078,00:34:00.246,Relieve some of the pressure.
00:34:01.039,00:34:06.002,"I mean, you could run a comb over the Jupiter, and I can work on this."
00:34:12.216,00:34:13.551,You should put on the radio.
00:34:14.427,00:34:16.596,-What's happening? -The Resolute.
00:34:23.936,00:34:27.398,which indicates the presence -of a gravitational singularity. -The black hole.
00:34:27.482,00:34:33.196,"To protect the lives onboard, we'll be forced to vacate the current orbit 24 hours from now."
00:34:36.616,00:34:46.250,"We are aware that some of you are still out there, trying to make it back. So, it's with a heavy heart that the surviving members of the Resolute 24th Colony Group -send this final broadcast. -No!"
00:34:46.334,00:34:47.168,24 hours.
00:35:00.681,00:35:01.808,"Hey, where are you going?"
00:35:02.558,00:35:04.060,To the Jupiter 4.
00:35:05.353,00:35:07.939,A lot of people have been doing unsupervised work there.
00:35:08.022,00:35:09.774,I wanna check it. Again.
00:35:17.532,00:35:20.535,"Hey, guys. So why don't you go get your gear ready?"
00:35:21.702,00:35:24.122,We're gonna be back on the Resolute tomorrow. Together.
00:35:25.164,00:35:26.082,Huh?
00:35:27.166,00:35:28.918,"Come on, let's get going."
00:35:52.984,00:35:54.110,Hmm.
00:36:00.950,00:36:02.827,"Will, is that you?"
00:36:11.836,00:36:13.254,Then don't.
00:36:17.258,00:36:20.011,I don't want you to get caught up in this.
00:36:30.271,00:36:31.314,In what?
00:36:33.566,00:36:35.276,It's really not my place.
00:36:35.860,00:36:37.195,It's just...
00:36:38.905,00:36:44.160,Some people think that kids aren't mature enough to handle the truth.
00:36:44.577,00:36:47.997,-The truth about what? -The mission.
00:36:48.831,00:36:51.292,Has your mother told you how dangerous it is?
00:36:51.709,00:36:54.003,"Yeah, she told us all about it."
00:36:56.339,00:36:57.256,Wow.
00:37:00.384,00:37:02.261,You're such a strong kid.
00:37:05.473,00:37:06.474,I mean...
00:37:09.060,00:37:17.109,"I don't think I could let my dad sacrifice himself, even if it did get everyone off this planet."
00:37:17.193,00:37:18.694,He's not sacrificing.
00:37:20.071,00:37:21.530,He's gonna make it.
00:37:22.198,00:37:23.950,He said he'll be fine.
00:37:26.035,00:37:31.165,I was about your age when my dad went into the hospital.
00:37:31.749,00:37:40.591,"And I remember, everyone was there, and when I asked what was going on, they told me not to worry, that he was going to be fine."
00:37:42.176,00:37:46.514,Turns out everyone was just saying that...
00:37:49.267,00:37:51.602,because they didn't want me to be sad.
00:37:54.730,00:37:56.315,But when he died...
00:37:57.858,00:37:59.360,it hurt so much.
00:37:59.986,00:38:03.030,Would it have been easier if I'd been able to prepare for it?
00:38:04.448,00:38:05.283,Maybe.
00:38:09.203,00:38:14.875,Sometimes parents think they have to lie to protect their kids.
00:38:16.377,00:38:19.046,But friends can be honest with each other.
00:38:19.505,00:38:24.677,"And right now, I'm the only one telling the truth."
00:38:26.637,00:38:35.604,"There's a chance that Jupiter makes it to the Resolute, but whoever flies it won't survive the trip."
00:38:36.439,00:38:40.192,"-No, but my mom, she said-- -Is a very intelligent woman..."
00:38:41.902,00:38:43.654,but she doesn't know everything.
00:38:45.031,00:38:48.701,She doesn't know there's someone else who can fly this Jupiter.
00:38:48.784,00:38:50.202,It doesn't have to be your dad.
00:39:07.345,00:39:10.222,I don't go to your place and triple check your rocket science stuff.
00:39:10.306,00:39:12.433,"Sorry, I just need to make sure there's nothing wrong."
00:39:12.516,00:39:14.769,"You do know that's literally my job, right?"
00:39:17.104,00:39:19.648,"1967, Soyuz 1, parachute failure."
00:39:19.732,00:39:22.485,"1971, Soyuz 11, cabin vent valve."
00:39:22.568,00:39:25.154,"1986, Challenger, faulty O-ring seal."
00:39:25.237,00:39:29.325,"2003, Columbia, damaged thermal protection system."
00:39:29.408,00:39:33.329,Everyone died in these accidents and you know what they all have in common?
00:39:35.247,00:39:37.625,A mechanic cleared them for launch.
00:39:37.708,00:39:41.253,You know what else they have in common? Don West wasn't born yet.
00:39:41.629,00:39:45.466,"Now call me thorough, call me lucky, but nothing's ever gone wrong on my watch."
00:39:45.549,00:39:47.218,Weren't you working on the Resolute?
00:39:47.301,00:39:49.804,-We were attacked by an alien robot. -On your watch.
00:39:51.722,00:39:53.933,Okay. I'm sorry. I'm...
00:39:56.602,00:39:59.146,This is our last chance.
00:39:59.897,00:40:01.273,And my husband...
00:40:02.983,00:40:10.324,"My husband's gonna be up there hurtling through space, and I don't know if he can-- You're not the only one who needs this to work, Mrs. Robinson."
00:40:16.622,00:40:18.958,Maybe there's something you can do to help us.
00:40:20.793,00:40:23.337,"Finally, this guy's reading the directions."
00:40:28.509,00:40:29.927,Get the weight down on the Jupiter?
00:40:30.010,00:40:33.264,"Oh, like any good fighter, she had to shed the last few pounds."
00:40:33.347,00:40:36.142,"But we're actually 200 under, if you can believe it."
00:40:36.225,00:40:40.354,Pretty sure the CPDS took us over the top. All she needs now is a good pilot.
00:40:46.193,00:40:48.821,-What intervals are you running at? -20 seconds.
00:40:48.904,00:40:54.285,-You can get away with 30. -But standard iteration-- Standard iteration's for standard situations.
00:40:54.910,00:40:58.789,"With such low fuel pressure to begin with, vent too soon, you won't make it into orbit."
00:40:59.165,00:41:01.792,Vent every 30. She can take it.
00:41:03.794,00:41:05.421,Maybe we should put the CPDS back in.
00:41:05.504,00:41:08.466,Mmm. That's over 700 pounds.
00:41:11.135,00:41:15.764,-Interesting. How much do you weigh? -Excuse me?
00:41:15.848,00:41:17.725,"You're, like, 174-75?"
00:41:25.274,00:41:28.319,Wait a minute. No. See what you're doing.
00:41:28.402,00:41:32.615,You know these ships better than anyone. Who better to be there -if something goes wrong-- -Stop. I'm sorry.
00:41:32.698,00:41:35.326,"I'm the wrong guy, okay? Good luck with that."
00:41:35.409,00:41:37.244,Send me a postcard. Hi. Bye.
00:41:37.953,00:41:39.872,"Don. Don, stop."
00:41:41.499,00:41:44.376,"-This is about my dad's life. -Yeah. It's my life, too."
00:41:44.460,00:41:46.420,"Look, he can't do it on his own, okay?"
00:41:46.504,00:41:48.797,"And if he doesn't make it, then it is all of our lives."
00:41:48.881,00:41:49.882,Ease off.
00:41:50.549,00:41:52.468,Is this about money again?
00:41:53.052,00:41:54.678,I thought we were past that.
00:41:59.225,00:42:01.435,Then what is it gonna take for you to do the right thing?
00:42:02.561,00:42:05.314,You know what doing the right thing has done for me?
00:42:05.814,00:42:08.150,"Save a lady in the desert, get left for dead."
00:42:08.234,00:42:12.029,"Flip a tanker for you, lose a very comfortable retirement."
00:42:12.112,00:42:15.282,"So, from where I'm standing, doing the right thing kinda sucks."
00:42:21.080,00:42:23.791,No. I'm not gonna do it.
00:42:24.375,00:42:27.378,"Nope. Nope, nope, nope. No."
00:42:30.130,00:42:30.965,Son of a...
00:42:32.007,00:42:33.968,"If anyone asks, I got paid for this."
00:42:34.051,00:42:35.427,-A lot. -Mmm-hmm.
00:42:38.806,00:42:40.474,"-No. I want a holiday. -...nine, eight..."
00:42:41.058,00:42:43.769,"-Don West Appreciation Day. -...seven, six..."
00:42:43.852,00:42:47.898,"-Colony Salvation Day for Don West. -...five, -four, three... -I want my face on a postage stamp."
00:42:57.408,00:42:59.702,What kind of a torture chamber have you got going on?
00:43:01.036,00:43:02.788,I'm swallowing my tongue...
00:43:10.212,00:43:12.047,"Okay, you woke up a bit slow, but that's all right."
00:43:12.131,00:43:14.925,I need you to roll 15 degrees to your left.
00:43:16.677,00:43:19.013,"That's it. Okay, hit thrusters."
00:43:19.638,00:43:20.973,23-degree pitch.
00:43:27.646,00:43:29.815,"Now, Don, vent the engines."
00:43:34.153,00:43:35.112,Don!
00:43:52.796,00:43:54.423,Welcome to space!
00:44:02.598,00:44:07.519,I'm also here. Being brave and awesome. Doing the right thing or whatever.
00:44:08.437,00:44:09.521,"Yeah, no one cares."
00:44:13.442,00:44:15.110,Shouldn't we run the test one more time?
00:45:27.391,00:45:30.144,"Dr. Robinson, I got something for ya."
00:45:34.648,00:45:36.567,"Mmm, I don't want your chicken."
00:45:36.650,00:45:40.279,"And I don't wanna hurl through space in a Thermos, but here we are."
00:45:40.529,00:45:44.032,"Listen, I left instructions in there. What she eats, when she eats."
00:45:44.116,00:45:48.412,"And if you need to put her to sleep, all you gotta do, turn over, stroke her belly ever so gently..."
00:45:48.495,00:45:51.290,"-Okay, I'll see what I can do. -...and she'll purr like a little-- Okay."
00:46:20.694,00:46:22.362,He'll be all right.
00:46:25.991,00:46:29.077,"All right, I'm gonna go inside."
00:46:29.161,00:46:30.704,Pre-launch protocols start soon.
00:46:30.787,00:46:33.624,"-Okay, let's go. -Yep. Yeah. Let's go."
00:46:51.141,00:46:53.101,Do you think we'll be able to see it from up here?
00:46:54.645,00:46:55.979,We should.
00:47:03.529,00:47:04.738,"Oh, uh..."
00:47:05.155,00:47:06.907,I think he's too nervous to watch.
00:47:17.167,00:47:19.169,You said someone else could pilot the Jupiter.
00:47:20.087,00:47:22.923,Come closer and I'll show you.
00:47:36.853,00:47:41.441,We could bring it back. You and me. Together.
00:47:42.776,00:47:44.111,I can't.
00:47:44.194,00:47:48.490,"But it was only bad because you told it to be bad, remember?"
00:47:48.991,00:47:55.414,What if... What if we start it over and you told it to be good?
00:47:56.415,00:47:58.375,He could fly that ship.
00:48:00.335,00:48:05.382,"All you have to do is open this door, and your father can come home."
00:48:29.740,00:48:35.996,"Upon returning home, Akiyama Toyohiro, first Japanese citizen in space, said..."
00:48:47.883,00:48:49.593,"Fly safe, John Robinson."
00:49:48.694,00:49:51.989,"Jupiter 2, this is Jupiter 4. Copy."
00:49:57.202,00:49:58.912,Final pre-launch protocol.
00:50:00.622,00:50:02.332,"Seals, check."
00:50:03.291,00:50:04.751,"Internal power, check."
00:50:05.127,00:50:07.629,"Fuel pre-press, check."
00:50:09.339,00:50:10.716,All systems go.
00:50:12.300,00:50:15.971,"Copy, Jupiter 2. Permission to launch?"
00:50:18.140,00:50:19.725,Permission granted.
00:50:20.726,00:50:25.772,Launch will commence in T-minus 60 seconds.
00:50:26.648,00:50:27.774,Affirmative.
00:50:29.067,00:50:31.028,-Maureen. -Yes?
00:50:34.656,00:50:35.532,I love you.
00:50:38.535,00:50:39.870,"I love you, too."
00:50:42.622,00:50:43.498,"I love you, too."
00:50:49.629,00:50:51.006,See you in a bit.
00:51:03.727,00:51:05.812,You're set for liftoff in...
00:51:07.439,00:51:25.457,"T-minus ten, ...six, five, ...liftoff."
00:52:18.385,00:52:23.056,Come on. You can do it. Come on. Come on.
00:52:43.743,00:52:44.870,John?
00:52:47.455,00:52:49.291,"John, come back to me."
00:52:50.542,00:52:51.960,I'm here.
00:52:59.509,00:53:01.094,"That's okay, I've got you."
00:53:03.513,00:53:06.474,"Winds at your eight o'clock, real ones this time."
00:53:10.312,00:53:12.898,They're coming in at just over 500 miles per hour.
00:53:21.031,00:53:22.782,What? Uh...
00:53:25.160,00:53:29.664,"Uh, yeah. Yep. Yeah, let's, uh... let's..."
00:53:31.917,00:53:33.460,Let's nothing. I need a sec here.
00:53:33.543,00:53:36.713,"Don, engines are getting hot. We need to vent."
00:53:37.297,00:53:39.841,"The hull's facing away from the sun, partner."
00:53:40.258,00:53:41.968,-You okay? -I'm...
00:53:44.012,00:53:45.597,"John, you need to take over."
00:53:45.680,00:53:47.390,"No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait."
00:53:47.474,00:53:49.768,"If we do it too soon, we won't make it out."
00:53:49.851,00:53:51.061,"Don, you need to vent now."
00:53:51.144,00:53:53.647,She can take it. Just give me five more seconds.
00:53:58.151,00:53:58.985,Now!
00:54:18.964,00:54:20.256,You're almost there.
00:54:21.216,00:54:22.509,You're a lucky man.
00:54:33.436,00:54:34.562,Maureen?
00:54:34.980,00:54:36.231,Noctilucent clouds.
00:54:38.441,00:54:39.526,Hold position.
00:55:10.265,00:55:12.976,Left or right? Left or right? 48 degrees left or...
00:13:42.279,00:13:43.489,Incredible.
00:36:10.209,00:36:12.295,Let's go.
00:36:13.045,00:36:14.505,Is she crazy?
00:36:16.340,00:36:19.218,We walk very quietly.
00:36:19.802,00:36:20.887,Step by step.
00:36:20.970,00:36:22.763,Sure. Then gross things fly down...
00:36:22.847,00:36:23.723,And eat us.
00:36:24.932,00:36:26.767,You have a better idea?
00:36:27.727,00:36:29.020,"No, but..."
00:36:29.729,00:36:30.605,What do you think?
00:36:33.983,00:36:35.526,He's hurt.
00:36:36.152,00:36:37.904,We have to get him help.
00:36:39.655,00:36:41.824,"Okay, okay, okay."
00:36:43.159,00:36:45.161,Let's go.
00:00:11.219,00:00:17.726,"One week ago today, the Earth was struck by a super bolide meteor at 9:37 Pacific Standard Time on Christmas night."
00:00:18.018,00:00:20.395,I'm currently standing at the edge of the quarantine zone...
00:00:20.478,00:00:21.521,It doesn't make sense.
00:00:21.604,00:00:23.898,You can see what was once part of Canada's Yukon Territory...
00:00:25.817,00:00:28.528,We have satellites that are supposed to detect these things.
00:00:29.279,00:00:31.364,-We had warning. -We had a few days.
00:00:31.448,00:00:32.449,We should have had months.
00:00:32.741,00:00:35.160,-Maybe it was moving too fast. -That's your theory?
00:00:35.243,00:00:37.912,-That it was moving too fast? -I didn't say it was a good theory.
00:00:37.996,00:00:42.041,Couldn't radiation from it have blinded our satellites?
00:00:44.502,00:00:49.215,"I suppose so. Nothing about how this has behaved follows any of our models, so..."
00:00:49.299,00:00:50.550,What does that mean?
00:00:56.848,00:01:06.900,"it... it shoots off hundreds of smaller particulates back into the sky, making smaller meteorites that eventually fall back to Earth, but there have been no reports of additional fallout."
00:01:09.652,00:01:16.284,"Hey, Will, I love annoying sounds as much as the next girl, -but think you could turn it down? -I'm just trying to contact Dad."
00:01:16.785,00:01:19.871,He's out in the middle of all that. I just want to make sure he's safe.
00:01:20.246,00:01:22.999,He said that we wouldn't be able to contact him for a while.
00:01:24.167,00:01:27.545,But he says if I use this and make fast radio bursts...
00:01:28.296,00:01:30.632,it can reach him no matter where he is.
00:01:31.633,00:01:32.675,We set up this code.
00:01:36.638,00:01:38.181,It means Are you okay?
00:01:39.265,00:01:40.600,And then he answers back.
00:01:41.684,00:01:44.646,"And that way, we know he's safe."
00:01:45.188,00:01:48.024,"Sweetheart, his receiver is probably just turned off."
00:01:52.028,00:01:53.321,Penny.
00:01:56.533,00:01:57.534,Look...
00:01:59.494,00:02:01.788,the frequency is probably just busy.
00:02:03.081,00:02:05.083,There's a lot of bandwidth being used right now.
00:02:10.380,00:02:11.631,Just keep trying.
00:02:32.735,00:02:34.946,Maybe it's the repeater. I'm still adjusting.
00:02:35.029,00:02:36.573,-Will. -Or the wrong frequency.
00:02:38.491,00:02:39.617,interfering with the signal.
00:02:39.701,00:02:41.911,-You can't reach him. -You don't know that.
00:02:45.081,00:02:47.417,What color was the explosion? Was it red?
00:02:47.500,00:02:52.255,"Red could indicate low temperature combustion, which proves parts of the ship could still be intact."
00:02:52.380,00:02:53.298,It wasn't red.
00:02:56.259,00:02:58.094,Did you see any pieces fall to the ground?
00:02:58.178,00:02:59.137,I don't know.
00:03:00.388,00:03:02.348,Dad was wearing a suit. He'd have oxygen.
00:03:02.432,00:03:06.186,"He could be fine. We don't know for sure-- Okay, but here's what we do know."
00:03:06.895,00:03:09.814,Dad would not want us to be focused on him right now.
00:03:11.399,00:03:13.234,-He'd want us to find Mom. -How?
00:03:13.943,00:03:16.237,Dr. Smith could've taken her anywhere.
00:03:18.948,00:03:19.991,Exactly.
00:03:21.326,00:03:23.745,But the fact that she took her tells us something.
00:03:23.828,00:03:27.957,It means that Smith needs her. We figure out why...
00:03:30.627,00:03:32.212,and we'll know where to find them.
00:03:50.605,00:03:51.856,Careful.
00:03:53.191,00:03:54.859,You may have a concussion.
00:04:04.577,00:04:07.497,What happened to the Jupiter? Where's John?
00:04:09.082,00:04:11.834,There was... There was an accident.
00:04:13.086,00:04:13.920,What?
00:04:14.504,00:04:15.338,He...
00:04:18.258,00:04:19.092,They didn't make it.
00:04:31.688,00:04:35.275,The thing is... I needed your help.
00:04:37.277,00:04:39.112,"I just didn't know they needed it, too."
00:04:43.825,00:04:50.290,"I understand how you must feel and I don't blame you, but we need to put the past behind us."
00:04:50.373,00:04:51.708,Where are my children?
00:04:51.791,00:04:55.253,"Your children are fine. I need you to focus, Maureen."
00:04:56.087,00:04:58.923,The Resolute leaves in a matter of hours.
00:04:59.007,00:05:03.803,"If you have any hope of saving your family, you will help me."
00:05:04.512,00:05:05.596,Help you?
00:05:05.680,00:05:08.349,The alien ship. Take me there.
00:05:08.850,00:05:14.480,"And I give you my word, I will get you and your children off this dying rock."
00:05:20.570,00:05:24.574,I don't know... but she had it.
00:05:26.701,00:05:28.036,The robot head?
00:05:28.578,00:05:30.997,"Yeah, she said she could bring him back."
00:05:31.080,00:05:33.875,"But why would she need Mom? If anything, she would've needed you."
00:05:33.958,00:05:37.545,"Yeah, I agree, it doesn't add up. There's gotta be more to it."
00:05:38.921,00:05:41.007,Sitting here doesn't help. They can't have gone far.
00:05:41.382,00:05:43.551,Wait. I'm coming with you.
00:05:43.634,00:05:46.262,"-Will, no. Okay? Just stay here. -But I can help."
00:05:46.345,00:05:47.555,No! You've done enough!
00:05:54.353,00:05:58.149,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't... I didn't mean that."
00:05:58.232,00:05:59.067,No.
00:06:01.319,00:06:05.698,You're right. It's my fault. I let her out.
00:06:06.908,00:06:08.785,It's okay. Go.
00:07:34.162,00:07:35.037,Guys!
00:07:38.791,00:07:40.626,"Hey, what's going on?"
00:07:42.044,00:07:44.630,"-Seriously, what is going on in here? -Remember this?"
00:07:46.048,00:07:47.800,Yeah. It's the rock from the cave.
00:07:47.884,00:07:50.887,"Thing is, I don't think it's a rock."
00:07:51.679,00:07:53.055,Then what is it?
00:07:55.349,00:07:57.894,Highly concentrated biomass.
00:07:57.977,00:08:00.229,"So, petrified super poop?"
00:08:00.313,00:08:02.148,"Uh, yes, exactly."
00:08:02.231,00:08:04.734,"Okay. Excuse me, I'm washing my hands now."
00:08:05.318,00:08:07.820,-I was thinking-- -The waste converters.
00:08:08.362,00:08:17.205,Every Jupiter has one. And since it can turn human waste into biofuel-- Didn't Mom say it would take at least three years to produce enough waste to launch a Jupiter?
00:08:17.288,00:08:19.040,"Uh, yeah, but we don't have to produce it."
00:08:19.123,00:08:21.751,Whatever's been living in that cave has been doing it forever.
00:08:21.834,00:08:25.755,"Just so I'm clear, we spent the night in what is, essentially, an alien toilet?"
00:08:26.130,00:08:29.175,You better hope that whoever used it is no longer there.
00:08:36.599,00:08:41.771,"Whatever created it, it's from the top of the food chain. An apex predator."
00:08:49.278,00:08:52.490,Anybody got a better idea? The Resolute leaves in nine hours.
00:08:59.080,00:09:02.124,Let's get on the radio. We'll need all the help we can get.
00:09:03.292,00:09:07.255,"All right. While you guys work on that, I'm gonna go find Mom."
00:09:13.052,00:09:16.389,"Well, then I guess it's a good thing I take after my dad."
00:09:25.064,00:09:27.316,Tell Hiroki I'm taking his Chariot.
00:09:27.400,00:09:30.570,"Okay, but can you just... Can you... Okay..."
00:09:32.530,00:09:33.990,"Hey, what?"
00:09:35.866,00:09:42.832,"-Can you promise you're gonna be careful? -Penny, I'm-- -Can you promise me? -Yes, I promise."
00:09:48.963,00:09:51.882,Hey. Hey.
00:09:52.925,00:09:56.429,You're not losing anyone else today. Understand?
00:09:58.431,00:10:00.141,Are you sure that you can handle this alone?
00:10:01.267,00:10:02.435,Don't worry.
00:10:03.185,00:10:04.729,I'm not gonna be alone.
00:10:11.152,00:10:15.448,Was that your big plan? Fix the ship and fly away?
00:10:23.247,00:10:36.385,"In Will's video, the ship was making a sound and the robot responding to it, like it was recharging his batteries, bringing it back to life."
00:10:37.762,00:10:44.644,"Like Humpty Dumpty, Will put the robot back together again, and when he did, it somehow..."
00:10:46.812,00:10:48.105,healed itself.
00:10:49.315,00:10:55.821,"If used properly, I believe this magnificent machine could heal us all."
00:10:57.657,00:10:59.200,But first things first.
00:11:16.926,00:11:18.135,But you're not Will.
00:11:25.434,00:11:27.311,I never meant to hurt anyone.
00:11:27.895,00:11:31.399,I just wanted to get to Alpha Centauri for a fresh start.
00:11:31.482,00:11:33.734,Just like you. Just like John.
00:11:34.318,00:11:36.487,"We're not so different, you know."
00:11:37.446,00:11:43.285,"Just two people trying to atone for our mistakes, heal old wounds."
00:11:44.370,00:11:47.164,So whatever you think of me and the things that I've done...
00:11:47.832,00:11:49.166,I'm not a monster.
00:12:06.434,00:12:08.561,I don't remember it being this warm.
00:12:19.113,00:12:22.658,"-Uh, what do you think? -I think we'll need a lot more."
00:13:44.490,00:13:47.117,"We are, literally, full of shit."
00:13:49.745,00:13:52.122,Looks like we're alone. That's a good start.
00:13:55.459,00:13:56.919,Should we take a closer look?
00:14:41.213,00:14:42.089,What is it?
00:14:43.257,00:14:44.258,It's fresh.
00:15:18.584,00:15:20.461,to get all our Jupiters off this planet.
00:15:20.544,00:15:21.670,And the bad news?
00:15:22.296,00:15:27.259,We have to break it apart and haul it out of there -without making a sound. -But that's impossible.
00:15:27.343,00:15:30.095,I don't understand. Why do we have to be so quiet?
00:15:31.972,00:15:35.643,"Right. Well, there's some, uh... some worse news."
00:15:43.525,00:15:46.445,"Listen, why don't you untie me and I can help you figure it out."
00:15:46.862,00:15:49.865,-We'll go in the ship-- -How stupid do you think I am?
00:15:49.949,00:15:54.328,"I think that you are a lot of things, but stupid is not one of them."
00:15:56.455,00:16:01.085,You got me to believe you were a doctor. Got me to invite you into my family.
00:16:02.920,00:16:04.755,You made me think we were friends.
00:16:06.548,00:16:08.884,"If you're stupid, I don't know what that makes me."
00:16:09.468,00:16:13.347,Don't be hard on yourself. I'm pretty good at what I do.
00:16:13.430,00:16:16.392,So am I. And I'm a rocket scientist.
00:16:16.475,00:16:18.310,This is alien technology.
00:16:18.394,00:16:20.896,No. The laws of thermodynamics are universal.
00:16:21.438,00:16:22.940,"Energy, entropy..."
00:16:23.023,00:16:29.279,"If there is anyone on this planet that can figure out how to turn that ship on, it's me."
00:16:36.203,00:16:38.622,Stop. It's a team effort.
00:16:38.706,00:16:41.250,"Sometimes you just need to take a step back, look at things differently."
00:16:41.333,00:16:44.294,I hear we're calling it the Resolute? I like the sound of that.
00:16:44.878,00:16:46.338,Purposeful. Determined.
00:16:46.422,00:16:48.632,The director thinks it will play well with the media.
00:16:48.716,00:16:52.302,"Well, let's just make sure she can fly before we worry about how she plays."
00:16:52.386,00:17:00.144,"Well, we had a good week. If these figures hold, the structure should stay sound at 276,000 miles per hour."
00:17:00.477,00:17:01.770,And I can bring that upstairs?
00:17:01.854,00:17:04.440,"Ye... Yes. Uh, I just..."
00:17:05.399,00:17:06.233,What?
00:17:07.109,00:17:09.153,-It's just theoretical. -For now.
00:17:09.236,00:17:12.740,"Well, it's one thing to withstand those speeds, it's another thing to reach them."
00:17:12.823,00:17:14.950,Every model I've seen says we're decades away from that.
00:17:15.034,00:17:17.453,Yeah. There are more current models.
00:17:19.997,00:17:21.874,"You understand, it's a clearance thing."
00:17:23.834,00:17:24.918,Of course. I just...
00:17:25.002,00:17:30.799,"I mean, it... it would be great if our team could be let in-- Are you going to the avionics meeting at 3:00?"
00:17:31.967,00:17:36.388,"-Yes, I think so. -Good. I'll see you then."
00:18:05.167,00:18:06.627,Still trying to contact your father?
00:18:07.419,00:18:09.338,I want to let him know we have a plan.
00:18:09.755,00:18:12.132,-Had any response? -Not yet.
00:18:15.511,00:18:18.639,My friends and I used to send secret messages back and forth.
00:18:21.725,00:18:26.563,"I want you to know, when we get back to the Resolute, you and your sisters are welcome to stay with us for as long as you need."
00:18:26.647,00:18:30.359,"Thanks, but that won't be necessary."
00:18:30.442,00:18:32.736,-I just mean to say-- -My mom will be back soon.
00:18:37.449,00:18:38.408,and save him.
00:18:41.453,00:18:44.832,"It's good to think positively, but don't let that keep you from thinking rationally."
00:18:44.915,00:18:46.500,We need you here. We need your head here.
00:18:46.583,00:18:48.418,Helping the people who still have a chance.
00:18:51.713,00:18:52.548,Yeah.
00:18:58.178,00:18:59.179,"You know, Will..."
00:19:00.430,00:19:03.600,I wish your dad was here. I do.
00:19:04.685,00:19:05.978,I'm sorry he isn't.
00:19:06.311,00:19:09.565,"He was trying to do what he thought was best, just like you are now."
00:19:10.774,00:19:15.696,"But I always tell my son, there are times to follow your heart and times to follow your head."
00:19:16.071,00:19:20.742,Which one do you think my dad was following when he risked his life to save everyone?
00:19:24.454,00:19:26.498,It takes a certain type of person to do that.
00:19:28.834,00:19:29.668,Yeah.
00:19:30.669,00:19:33.046,"It does. But if he'd waited another day, he wouldn't have had to."
00:19:36.967,00:19:41.513,"History books are full of stories of heroic men and their sacrifices, but do you know who writes those stories?"
00:19:44.975,00:19:45.976,The survivors.
00:19:51.023,00:19:52.191,I'll see you inside.
00:21:41.174,00:21:43.385,"Okay, so that's the cave."
00:21:45.137,00:21:49.099,What are you doing all the way over there by yourself?
00:21:52.644,00:21:53.812,Got ya.
00:21:54.396,00:21:58.108,"All right. Hang on, Mom. I'm coming."
00:22:19.421,00:22:22.132,John was behind me. Uh...
00:22:23.717,00:22:26.845,"Yeah, over my right... No. Over... Over my left shoulder."
00:22:30.182,00:22:32.267,-Here? -Yes. That's right.
00:22:36.521,00:22:38.023,I don't see anything that could...
00:22:39.649,00:22:43.737,Wait. Maybe it wasn't me or John at all. Will.
00:22:43.862,00:22:45.364,-What about him? -He was...
00:22:50.077,00:22:52.829,"He was standing there, in that back corner."
00:22:53.288,00:22:56.208,-Over here? -Yeah. A little further back.
00:23:02.339,00:23:03.465,Do you see anything?
00:23:07.052,00:23:08.303,Smith?
00:23:09.304,00:23:13.683,"I think we should stick together. After all, we're a team now, right?"
00:23:19.523,00:23:22.484,Now tell me where your son was. The truth.
00:23:24.027,00:23:24.861,Outside.
00:23:26.238,00:23:28.365,-Outside? -He was outside with the robot.
00:23:28.448,00:23:30.158,He was teaching him how to throw a baseball.
00:23:34.788,00:23:38.708,All that power under his control and he uses it to play catch.
00:23:40.001,00:23:41.670,What would you use it for?
00:23:43.547,00:23:44.714,The truth.
00:23:49.094,00:23:50.303,To stop running.
00:23:53.223,00:23:54.432,Stop pretending.
00:23:58.186,00:23:59.896,With the robot by my side...
00:24:06.987,00:24:07.904,I could just...
00:24:10.824,00:24:12.033,be myself.
00:24:14.619,00:24:16.872,Do you remember who that is anymore?
00:24:17.664,00:24:21.042,"Just a girl, before her mother died."
00:24:24.171,00:24:27.841,Before her sister shone brighter in her father's eyes.
00:24:32.429,00:24:36.975,Before she ran away and filled the emptiness with mistakes.
00:24:41.480,00:24:43.106,I wanna be that girl.
00:24:44.399,00:24:46.234,You don't need a machine to be that.
00:24:47.569,00:24:50.405,"If you had known who I really was, would you have taken me in?"
00:24:51.072,00:24:54.576,"No. But a doctor, there's someone you could trust."
00:24:54.659,00:24:57.245,I didn't trust you because you were a doctor.
00:24:58.246,00:25:00.415,I trusted you because you helped us.
00:25:00.498,00:25:03.126,And that's all I'm trying to do right now.
00:25:04.461,00:25:06.796,To get us all off this planet.
00:25:08.340,00:25:09.591,Back to the Resolute.
00:25:11.551,00:25:16.348,"Don't you see, Maureen? I'm not the villain of this story."
00:25:25.398,00:25:26.483,So prove it.
00:25:33.031,00:25:33.949,Release me.
00:25:50.048,00:25:51.466,I don't think so.
00:25:57.222,00:25:58.056,"Oh, my God."
00:26:02.435,00:26:04.229,I've seen that before.
00:26:06.982,00:26:09.776,What part of restricted area don't you understand?
00:26:12.904,00:26:15.115,It's their fault for not being more specific.
00:26:15.198,00:26:18.410,"Plus, don't you wanna see what happens? Everybody's talking about it."
00:26:18.493,00:26:21.830,Everybody? You have two friends on the Resolute.
00:26:21.913,00:26:24.541,"Okay, and they're both talking about it. Shut up."
00:26:27.252,00:26:28.211,Here goes.
00:26:37.512,00:26:41.349,-It's magic. -No. It's science.
00:26:46.563,00:26:49.816,"Oh, yeah, sure. Now that it got nerdy, suddenly it's cool."
00:26:51.067,00:26:54.571,"-Can I try? -Yeah, go for it. Fight the power."
00:27:03.121,00:27:04.497,"Hey, guys."
00:27:06.374,00:27:09.336,"Hey, Mom. What's up?"
00:27:14.633,00:27:15.967,How long have you been standing there?
00:27:16.051,00:27:19.846,Long enough to know that you didn't go to the med bay like you were supposed to.
00:27:19.929,00:27:23.641,"Okay, in our defense, as far as teen rebellion goes, this is mild."
00:27:24.976,00:27:27.437,Do you have any idea what's behind there?
00:27:28.772,00:27:31.650,-Go get your immuno-boosters. -But I wanted-- Go.
00:28:25.286,00:28:29.124,-So what do we do now? -We find out what's behind this wall.
00:28:30.166,00:28:34.421,-But how's that gonna-- -Because the only thing that can create that kind of charge is power.
00:28:35.630,00:28:40.385,"This ship may look like it's dead, but it's still breathing."
00:28:54.190,00:28:56.985,-What? -You're carrying around this radio...
00:28:58.486,00:29:00.155,"Dad's gone, okay?"
00:29:01.448,00:29:07.454,-How can you say that? -It would have been impossible-- Any more impossible than Judy being saved from the ice?
00:29:08.538,00:29:12.751,You finding us in that storm? Mom and Dad being together again?
00:29:15.086,00:29:18.173,The impossible happens all the time.
00:29:21.342,00:29:22.927,Just have to believe it can.
00:29:59.088,00:30:01.424,Turn it off. Make it stop. What are you doing?
00:30:03.176,00:30:04.969,"Wait, it wasn't sending."
00:30:07.096,00:30:10.058,-It was receiving. -Dad's alive.
00:30:40.213,00:30:42.048,-Have you seen Vijay? -No!
00:30:55.353,00:30:56.604,What was that?
00:30:56.688,00:30:59.482,"It's called saving your life. Now, go! Run!"
00:31:13.872,00:31:14.747,Penny!
00:31:52.410,00:31:53.411,What is this?
00:31:55.788,00:31:56.748,Do you feel something?
00:31:58.124,00:31:59.334,"Nope, nothing."
00:32:06.507,00:32:07.842,There's another one here.
00:32:25.151,00:32:29.030,"-Where are you going? -Relax, I'm not going anywhere."
00:32:30.198,00:32:33.534,"Sometimes you just need to step back, get a different perspective."
00:32:39.082,00:32:41.209,How tall would you say the robot is?
00:32:45.380,00:32:49.008,"Because this ship was meant to be operated by him, not us."
00:32:50.760,00:32:55.640,"We need to be the robot's hands. Both of us, together."
00:32:57.600,00:33:00.269,"One, two, three."
00:33:08.069,00:33:09.237,What is that?
00:33:17.453,00:33:19.872,"Well, Ms. Harris, I have some good news..."
00:33:20.707,00:33:21.666,and some bad news.
00:33:22.250,00:33:26.379,"The good news, we haven't set up a system of justice yet."
00:33:26.838,00:33:30.967,No courts. No jail. Bad news...
00:33:31.342,00:33:37.432,"we haven't set up a system of justice yet, which means I can do whatever the hell I want to you."
00:33:39.559,00:33:42.020,"-Sir, we've had a breach. -What kind of a breach?"
00:33:42.103,00:33:43.938,I don't know. They're asking for you.
00:33:47.150,00:33:50.111,Sit tight. We are not done. Not even close.
00:34:07.503,00:34:12.133,"All Resolute colonists, please proceed to your assigned Jupiter pods."
00:34:12.216,00:34:14.093,Thank you for remaining calm.
00:34:21.476,00:34:23.728,There was always a risk they'd come back for it.
00:34:29.150,00:34:32.820,-So you protect it at all costs. -Yeah.
00:34:51.923,00:34:55.551,So the robot didn't just attack the Resolute.
00:34:55.635,00:34:56.636,No.
00:34:58.012,00:34:59.347,It came for something.
00:35:00.348,00:35:02.725,-Our engine. -But that makes no sense.
00:35:02.809,00:35:05.061,"I mean, they're clearly more advanced than we are."
00:35:06.729,00:35:12.360,-Why would they want our engine? -Because it wasn't our engine.
00:35:15.321,00:35:20.576,We didn't just miraculously develop the technology to travel the universe.
00:35:22.328,00:35:23.579,We stole it.
00:35:24.372,00:35:28.084,How? Did we capture one of their ships?
00:35:29.085,00:35:30.169,Shoot it down?
00:35:33.464,00:35:37.343,"To hide something like that, you'd need one hell of a cover story."
00:35:37.426,00:35:38.636,Something like a...
00:35:40.972,00:35:42.098,A Christmas star.
00:36:43.159,00:36:44.368,Let's go.
00:39:07.636,00:39:09.388,"-Penny! -Oh, my God."
00:39:19.106,00:39:19.940,Okay.
00:39:23.694,00:39:24.779,-Really? -Yeah.
00:39:25.863,00:39:29.367,"I don't know, but he's up there somewhere."
00:39:30.451,00:39:32.411,"Okay, what do you say we go find him?"
00:39:36.665,00:39:37.500,"Hey, Robinsons."
00:39:40.795,00:39:41.796,Well done.
00:39:54.600,00:39:55.643,Angela.
00:39:59.021,00:40:01.857,I wanted to say thank you for what you did back there.
00:40:02.900,00:40:09.573,"After what I did to your family, it's the least I could-- That wasn't your fault."
00:40:11.826,00:40:16.288,Dr. Smith has a way of making people do things they regret.
00:40:20.709,00:40:23.462,"Well, I appreciate your forgiveness."
00:40:25.005,00:40:30.052,"And when you see your father again, please tell him I'm sorry."
00:40:30.136,00:40:33.556,"Maybe you can tell him that yourself, once we're all back on the Resolute."
00:40:36.934,00:40:38.853,The Resolute leaves in four hours. Need to keep moving.
00:40:45.234,00:40:47.987,Vijay? Come on.
00:40:48.070,00:40:49.280,Be right there.
00:40:50.156,00:40:51.073,Hey.
00:40:51.866,00:40:52.700,Hey.
00:40:54.827,00:40:56.454,Thanks for saving my ass back there.
00:40:56.871,00:40:59.331,"Well, you'd look pretty stupid walking around without it."
00:40:59.415,00:41:00.666,"So, I thought..."
00:41:02.168,00:41:05.337,"-That was a joke. -Yeah, no, I know. Yeah. Um..."
00:41:06.130,00:41:09.800,I'm gonna go tell Judy the good news.
00:41:17.808,00:41:18.809,Yeah.
00:41:18.893,00:41:22.104,That it was rude and really immature.
00:41:22.188,00:41:25.483,"Well, I mean, I wasn't gonna use exactly those words..."
00:41:28.319,00:41:34.283,"Like, maybe when we're back up on the Resolute, we can hang out sometime?"
00:41:37.411,00:41:41.373,"No. No, I'm good. But, uh, see you around, Vijay."
00:42:01.602,00:42:05.689,Judy-- I can't talk right now. Think I found Mom. I'll call you later. Bye.
00:42:18.911,00:42:23.332,"Look, if you untie me, if I had the right equipment, I think I could get this ship flight-worthy."
00:42:23.415,00:42:25.960,Ugh! How's that supposed to help me?
00:42:26.043,00:42:28.254,"Well, you wouldn't die here, for one thing."
00:42:28.629,00:42:34.718,"If I go back to the Resolute without him, my life is over anyway."
00:42:35.678,00:42:39.932,"I'll be locked up, sent back to Earth. So thanks, but no thanks."
00:42:43.602,00:42:46.313,We could tell Radic about how you helped us to survive down here.
00:42:54.113,00:42:56.156,I give you my word.
00:43:01.912,00:43:07.084,"So if I were to ask right now if you were stalling, and waiting for your family to save you, you'd tell me the truth?"
00:43:12.464,00:43:15.759,I hope you're a better rocket scientist than you are a liar.
00:43:40.951,00:43:42.119,Judy!
00:43:43.287,00:43:46.874,"-Hey. We don't have much time, okay? -Get me out of this."
00:43:58.135,00:43:59.136,"Okay, now what?"
00:43:59.219,00:44:00.679,How about we get the hell off this planet?
00:44:00.763,00:44:02.431,Great. Any ideas how we can do that?
00:44:04.767,00:44:05.976,I'll let him tell you.
00:44:17.321,00:44:18.280,Back up.
00:44:20.115,00:44:20.949,Back up.
00:01:23.416,00:01:28.713,I'm the first human to discover evidence of an alien intelligence.
00:01:30.965,00:01:35.804,This appears to be the first known work of art of an artificial intelligence of alien origin.
00:02:53.715,00:02:59.053,How'd we all get caught up in the idea that launching into space like the most primitive astronauts in history was somehow genius?
00:02:59.137,00:03:01.848,-Are we doing this again? -If only you'd gone left.
00:03:01.931,00:03:04.976,"Look, Maureen didn't answer, which isn't like her."
00:03:05.059,00:03:10.398,"Left or right. It's a 50/50 shot. In my world, those are great odds."
00:03:10.481,00:03:13.193,A 50% chance of dying are terrible odds.
00:03:13.568,00:03:16.070,You never eject a man into outer space without his permission.
00:03:16.154,00:03:17.780,It's common courtesy.
00:03:22.327,00:03:24.329,Hey. We still have a couple of hours.
00:03:26.581,00:03:28.583,We had a 50/50 shot.
00:03:33.880,00:03:36.799,"Ready? One, two, three."
00:03:48.353,00:03:51.564,-The tremors are getting worse. -Yeah.
00:04:03.243,00:04:05.286,Almost all of them.
00:04:05.370,00:04:08.831,Hiroki's gonna be pretty upset when he figures out we snuck off his ship.
00:04:09.832,00:04:12.669,"Well, Robinsons stick together."
00:04:17.006,00:04:19.467,"Once Mom and Judy get back, we'll be all set to go?"
00:04:20.009,00:04:22.470,They haven't called in a while. They should be back by now.
00:04:26.933,00:04:28.476,Is that Dad back in range?
00:04:37.610,00:04:39.904,-It's Morse code. -What's he spelling?
00:04:40.571,00:04:42.198,-F. -Okay.
00:04:44.242,00:04:45.952,-U. -FU?
00:04:46.369,00:04:49.539,That's his message? FU? This is how your kids talk?
00:04:49.622,00:04:50.456,E.
00:04:50.540,00:04:52.208,"Okay, that changes everything."
00:04:53.293,00:04:54.168,L.
00:04:58.339,00:04:59.173,Yeah.
00:04:59.924,00:05:00.842,Yeah.
00:05:01.634,00:05:03.761,"If we'd waited a couple of hours, we wouldn't be here."
00:05:05.930,00:05:06.764,Great.
00:05:21.279,00:05:23.531,"-Mom, Judy, I have amazing news. -No, it can wait."
00:05:31.581,00:05:33.249,Yeah. There's four of us and one of you.
00:05:33.333,00:05:35.793,"Actually, there's two of me."
00:05:41.007,00:05:42.800,I want you to restrain Dr. Smith.
00:05:43.468,00:05:44.427,"Will, he's not the same."
00:05:45.678,00:05:46.763,"Robot, come here."
00:05:49.682,00:05:51.559,Stop! I said stop.
00:06:00.735,00:06:01.986,It's hers now.
00:06:06.115,00:06:09.827,I saved him this time from what you did to him.
00:06:10.411,00:06:12.455,Friends don't make friends walk off cliffs.
00:06:12.538,00:06:16.000,"-Leave him alone. -I'm just being honest. Right, Will?"
00:06:16.959,00:06:19.212,That's how we've always been with each other.
00:06:19.295,00:06:21.798,So what now? What do you want?
00:06:21.881,00:06:25.051,What we all want. To fly up to the Resolute.
00:06:25.385,00:06:28.012,I'm not holding any grudges. And you shouldn't either.
00:06:32.433,00:06:33.601,What is that annoying noise?
00:06:34.018,00:06:35.937,"-Will, is it... -Yeah."
00:06:36.020,00:06:38.147,-Is it what I think it is? -Yeah.
00:06:38.231,00:06:39.107,Think what is?
00:06:39.690,00:06:42.985,It's Dad. He's okay. He and Don are up there in orbit.
00:06:46.197,00:06:47.448,That's such great news.
00:06:54.747,00:06:56.624,My Morse code's a little rusty. What's he saying?
00:06:57.542,00:07:00.586,M-U...
00:07:01.462,00:07:03.422,G-U.
00:07:03.798,00:07:04.924,Mugu.
00:07:05.508,00:07:09.929,-Point Mugu. It's a state park. -I used to love that place.
00:07:10.012,00:07:11.264,But why is he talking about it?
00:07:11.347,00:07:13.099,It's a message. He's trying to tell us something.
00:07:18.062,00:07:19.981,"-Yeah, I remember that. -Okay, bonfire."
00:07:20.064,00:07:23.317,Why would that have anything to do with anything?
00:07:24.735,00:07:26.362,Could he build one up in space?
00:07:27.989,00:07:29.449,"Yes, I think so."
00:07:31.117,00:07:32.869,He's trying to tell us where he is.
00:07:33.244,00:07:35.413,Let's search the atmosphere for a heat signature.
00:07:35.997,00:07:39.417,Wait. We had a plan.
00:07:40.418,00:07:43.921,"-Same plan, slight detour. -I've had enough detours in my life."
00:07:48.134,00:07:52.096,You said that you didn't want to hurt John. Was that true?
00:07:55.516,00:07:56.684,Be honest.
00:07:59.729,00:08:01.564,How long before the Resolute leaves for good?
00:08:05.026,00:08:05.860,88 minutes.
00:08:32.178,00:08:34.472,Still got some fuel oxidizer in the lines.
00:08:35.097,00:08:37.850,I can rig it to blow a stream of burning gas.
00:08:41.437,00:08:43.189,Ow! Ow!
00:08:48.361,00:08:50.446,There's something in my eyes. Stings like hell.
00:08:53.658,00:08:56.661,"Oh, yeah. Some of the anti-fogging agent must have dried up and flaked off."
00:08:56.744,00:08:59.997,"Yeah, well, I can't see. I'll just have to feel around and wing it."
00:09:04.752,00:09:08.256,"Hey, you can't do this blind."
00:09:08.339,00:09:10.424,-Then who's gonna do it. You? -Yeah.
00:09:10.925,00:09:14.929,I assume you're comfortable identifying compression-loaded orthogrid cylinders.
00:09:15.012,00:09:17.390,Just gonna have to talk me through it. Okay?
00:09:18.683,00:09:19.850,How hard can it be?
00:09:24.438,00:09:26.107,You do know what a hexagon is?
00:09:49.380,00:09:50.256,Hi.
00:09:55.886,00:09:56.721,It's okay.
00:10:02.643,00:10:03.936,Remember this?
00:10:33.215,00:10:34.383,Hey.
00:10:37.928,00:10:40.514,You and me are still friends.
00:10:42.224,00:10:44.435,So that means you and the robot can still be friends.
00:10:49.440,00:10:50.691,It's not my friend.
00:11:03.454,00:11:04.955,"You said it, not he."
00:11:06.540,00:11:07.917,I guess I did.
00:11:09.293,00:11:14.465,"We're gonna fix him, okay? We'll get him back to the way he was."
00:11:16.592,00:11:18.302,It's not coming back.
00:11:31.065,00:11:32.441,Pop-outs secured.
00:11:34.276,00:11:36.070,Smith really gonna let us rescue Dad and Don?
00:11:37.071,00:11:40.032,-She hasn't said no yet. -I wish we could leave her here.
00:11:42.868,00:11:47.081,Be thankful she's not leaving us. Be thankful she can't pilot the ship.
00:11:48.541,00:11:51.460,Can we really let Smith bring that robot to the Resolute?
00:11:51.544,00:11:54.296,With all those people there? Who knows what she's gonna do.
00:11:54.380,00:11:56.715,We'll deal with one problem at a time.
00:12:06.392,00:12:09.395,It was always there. It was just disguised as a mountain.
00:12:23.534,00:12:24.869,Liftoff's gonna get pretty bumpy.
00:12:25.744,00:12:26.787,How bumpy?
00:12:28.873,00:12:32.293,The hub is the safest place on the ship. You're free to stay here...
00:12:33.502,00:12:35.963,or you can ride up front with me. Your choice.
00:12:43.888,00:12:45.556,Not that I don't trust you.
00:12:52.313,00:12:54.398,"Okay, helmets on."
00:13:11.957,00:13:14.543,"Excuse me, I need to perform pre-launch checks."
00:13:14.960,00:13:16.128,It's okay.
00:13:21.884,00:13:23.719,I usually have a co-pilot.
00:13:24.637,00:13:27.014,You seem to be doing fine on your own.
00:13:28.557,00:13:32.561,"But then, you've had years of practice of having to do everything all by yourself."
00:13:33.395,00:13:36.232,Are you sure we need to go out of our way to pick up your husband?
00:13:37.775,00:13:40.569,Do you ever feel guilty about anything you do?
00:13:43.155,00:13:45.616,Guilt is like a stomachache from overeating.
00:13:46.659,00:13:52.706,"You make all sorts of promises while you're feeling it, but once it passes, you just get hungry again."
00:13:52.790,00:13:54.250,Most people are not like you.
00:13:54.333,00:13:57.711,Everybody's like me. I'm just not in denial.
00:13:58.295,00:13:59.922,Denial about what?
00:14:03.217,00:14:07.221,You think you're so different? You love John because he protects you.
00:14:07.721,00:14:10.516,You fight for your kids because it gives you purpose.
00:14:10.599,00:14:12.393,"Even Will, all that sweetness..."
00:14:13.644,00:14:16.230,it's only because he's scared and he wants to feel safe.
00:14:16.313,00:14:18.232,Don't you dare talk to me about my son.
00:14:20.818,00:14:23.445,"He's a perfectly fine kid, but he's no angel."
00:14:24.154,00:14:26.824,He's not selfless. Nobody is.
00:14:39.879,00:14:43.465,"eight, seven, six, five..."
00:14:46.093,00:14:48.262,"-two, one. -Well, we've got that in common."
00:15:17.625,00:15:22.796,"Okay, planet that we never bothered to name, this is between us now."
00:15:25.966,00:15:27.676,We're leaving.
00:15:46.987,00:15:49.990,"Judy, Penny, Will, we're clear."
00:15:56.246,00:15:58.624,But I guess everything looks pretty from far enough away.
00:16:11.971,00:16:14.974,-Isn't it supposed to float? -Yes.
00:16:21.730,00:16:22.690,Are we in orbit?
00:16:24.316,00:16:25.359,"Yes, we are."
00:16:27.778,00:16:30.614,"And no, I don't know why there's gravity on the ship."
00:16:49.299,00:16:52.428,"I repeat. Jupiter 2, this is Victor Dhar calling you from the Resolute."
00:16:56.557,00:17:00.811,"I don't know if you can hear us, but every one of the other Jupiters made it here safely."
00:17:01.729,00:17:03.564,"And for that, we owe you a debt of gratitude."
00:17:05.858,00:17:10.446,"However, as you're well aware, there's a black hole making this section of space extremely treacherous."
00:17:11.572,00:17:15.409,You now have 63 minutes to join us.
00:17:17.828,00:17:19.121,I hope you will.
00:17:19.496,00:17:22.124,"Because after that time, we simply can't wait any longer."
00:17:24.293,00:17:25.627,"Resolute, out."
00:17:27.004,00:17:28.464,63 minutes?
00:17:29.798,00:17:33.761,"-That's plenty of time to get John. -Oh, yeah, that's right."
00:17:42.436,00:17:43.896,Insufficient fuel?
00:17:44.605,00:17:48.067,Don't pay any attention to that. The system isn't properly calibrated.
00:17:48.650,00:17:54.740,Because it sounds a lot like we won't have enough fuel to go find your husband and still make it back to the Resolute.
00:17:54.823,00:17:57.993,-I'll tighten the search perimeters. -That's insufficient.
00:17:59.036,00:18:07.669,It's time for you to put aside your personal feelings Sometimes you have to let people go.
00:18:10.297,00:18:12.091,Set a course for the Resolute.
00:18:13.509,00:18:14.426,No.
00:18:16.887,00:18:20.265,Set a course for the Resolute and you and your kids can go there with me.
00:18:22.518,00:18:25.938,Or I'll throw you off the ship and find a way to get there myself.
00:18:27.356,00:18:30.818,-You think you hold all the cards? -I know I do.
00:18:30.901,00:18:33.112,-Are you sure? -I have a robot.
00:18:34.655,00:18:35.489,Ahhh!
00:18:41.286,00:18:43.038,-Mom? -Trust her.
00:18:45.082,00:18:48.001,Are you crazy? You'd commit suicide with your kids?
00:18:49.837,00:18:53.549,We're Robinsons. Live together or die together.
00:18:59.888,00:19:01.098,She's bluffing.
00:19:09.982,00:19:11.066,Stop it.
00:19:27.332,00:19:28.834,Orbit stabilized.
00:19:48.812,00:19:52.274,Open the door! Get me out of here!
00:20:09.499,00:20:11.460,You're in the safest room on the ship.
00:20:11.877,00:20:14.171,It was designed to survive an asteroid collision.
00:20:14.504,00:20:16.548,It was designed to withstand solar flares.
00:20:16.632,00:20:20.385,It was designed to repel temperatures that drop to absolute zero.
00:20:20.469,00:20:22.846,And do you know who designed it? Me.
00:20:23.305,00:20:25.265,So don't expect to get out any time soon.
00:20:35.651,00:20:36.485,Break the glass.
00:20:44.785,00:20:47.663,-You can't keep me in here forever. -That's true.
00:20:47.996,00:20:49.665,But you'll be in there for long enough.
00:20:50.249,00:20:52.876,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to find my husband."
00:20:59.675,00:21:02.302,You do realize you can never criticize us for being reckless again.
00:21:02.386,00:21:05.347,Of course I can. I'm your mother. You and Judy get the harpoon ready.
00:21:13.814,00:21:17.150,"-There is no green wire. -Okay, find the black wire."
00:21:18.110,00:21:20.028,-There's no black wire. -What do you see?
00:21:20.112,00:21:22.572,"Whole bunch of wires, none of which are green or black."
00:21:22.656,00:21:30.122,"Whoever installed this must've swapped out this unit with another controller to cut corners. It was probably that Williamson, -that cheap son of a bitch. -So what do I do here?"
00:21:30.205,00:21:36.962,"There are a thousand possible scenarios to choose from, only one of which would work. I'd know if I saw it."
00:21:37.045,00:21:41.508,Okay. Okay. You're just gonna have to see it.
00:21:42.551,00:21:46.013,"As it happens, our eyes have the ability to generate liquid. They're called tears."
00:21:46.096,00:21:47.889,-You want me to cry? -Yeah.
00:21:47.973,00:21:49.141,"Well, how?"
00:21:50.600,00:21:55.272,"Well, I don't know, I mean, I... Think of something sad."
00:21:55.355,00:21:58.191,-That seems to work for most people. -I can't cry out of nowhere.
00:22:00.068,00:22:01.445,"Okay, okay."
00:22:01.528,00:22:06.199,Picture all your family and friends that you left behind on Earth that you may never see again.
00:22:06.283,00:22:09.244,"There's no one I really care about. Otherwise, I wouldn't have left."
00:22:09.328,00:22:12.456,I've been on my own ever since before I could tie my shoelaces.
00:22:12.539,00:22:13.832,Which I taught myself.
00:22:15.667,00:22:16.752,I've seen a lot of orphans.
00:22:16.835,00:22:20.464,Who says I'm an orphan? My parents are alive and well.
00:22:21.048,00:22:22.341,"Somewhere, I guess."
00:22:23.675,00:22:25.093,I'm sorry they ditched you.
00:22:25.844,00:22:28.555,Must be tough knowing that they never loved you.
00:22:30.182,00:22:36.688,"That they thought you were a worthless piece of-- Hey, what the hell, man? Why do you-- Oh, I see what you're doing."
00:22:37.105,00:22:39.399,Trying to make me cry. You have to do better than that.
00:22:39.483,00:22:44.404,You know what? Forget about it. I'll figure it out myself.
00:22:50.410,00:22:52.913,We actually have a harpoon gun.
00:22:52.996,00:22:56.416,"All my life, I feel like I've been missing out on harpooning things."
00:22:59.836,00:23:01.755,we never got to finish Moby-Dick.
00:23:01.838,00:23:04.091,"-Only got to, like, page 30. -The whale kills Ahab."
00:23:04.800,00:23:05.842,Spoiler alert.
00:23:06.176,00:23:09.971,It was written in 1851. You had your shot.
00:23:15.310,00:23:17.020,Do we still have enough to find Dad?
00:23:17.646,00:23:19.523,I'm starting another infrared sweep.
00:23:21.358,00:23:23.777,"If he can get that bonfire lit soon, we should be okay."
00:23:31.159,00:23:35.831,I never should have saved him. Should have let him die in that tree.
00:23:39.292,00:23:43.713,The robot is only as good as its master. You are a very good person.
00:23:46.425,00:23:48.301,The robot saved Judy because of you.
00:23:50.137,00:23:52.139,-Because of me? -That's right.
00:23:52.222,00:23:54.683,Judy was trapped in the ice because of me.
00:23:55.809,00:23:56.893,No one blames you for that.
00:23:56.977,00:23:58.478,I should have been able to swim down.
00:23:58.562,00:24:01.898,"If I would've swam down and gotten the battery, everything would have been fine."
00:24:01.982,00:24:02.941,Enough.
00:24:03.275,00:24:07.028,We have plenty of problems to solve now without rehashing the past.
00:24:26.631,00:24:29.676,"-I didn't pass the test, did I? -What test?"
00:24:34.222,00:24:35.640,I didn't pass.
00:24:39.853,00:24:40.770,"No, you didn't."
00:24:42.022,00:24:43.148,Then how am I here?
00:24:45.692,00:24:47.652,You deserve to be at the colony.
00:24:47.736,00:24:50.280,There's no test that could convince me otherwise.
00:24:50.363,00:24:51.573,But how am I here?
00:24:54.201,00:24:55.952,I pulled some strings.
00:24:58.330,00:25:01.374,"-You did something wrong. -No, not wrong."
00:25:03.126,00:25:06.046,Illegal. There's a big difference.
00:25:20.602,00:25:23.480,Can't you hit it any harder?
00:25:27.525,00:25:29.736,"I know you, Maureen."
00:25:29.819,00:25:33.323,You didn't design this as a cage.
00:25:33.782,00:25:36.701,You designed this to protect your children.
00:25:36.785,00:25:43.166,Yes. You would absolutely have built in a way for them to get out.
00:25:49.798,00:25:52.884,"I may have skipped orientation, but I am a quick learner."
00:25:56.429,00:26:00.350,"If you make yourself throw up, you're gonna have a bigger problem than blindness."
00:26:02.811,00:26:03.979,It's not working anyway.
00:26:13.655,00:26:14.990,"I need your eyes, Don."
00:26:16.658,00:26:24.124,"Hey, seriously though, the thought of dying doesn't make you feel sad?"
00:26:24.207,00:26:25.959,Don't you have any regrets?
00:26:30.797,00:26:35.927,There was a time all I ever thought about was the things I never did.
00:26:37.971,00:26:42.517,Birthday card I forgot to mail. Birthday card I forgot to buy.
00:26:53.611,00:27:01.995,"But then, I came to realize it was all the days in between I was really missing out on."
00:27:23.558,00:27:30.148,"But you know, crashing on this planet is the best thing that ever happened to me because it helped me find them again."
00:27:33.485,00:27:37.822,I love Penny 'cause she gives me lip.
00:27:38.114,00:27:41.993,But she tries harder than anyone will ever give her credit for.
00:27:42.577,00:27:47.374,I love Will 'cause he sees things that I can't see.
00:27:47.457,00:27:49.334,"Anyway, he's smarter than I am."
00:27:50.377,00:27:57.092,"I love Judy 'cause even though I'm not her biological dad, she's exactly like me."
00:27:57.175,00:28:00.762,"I mean, she's strong, fearless."
00:28:10.563,00:28:11.648,Hey.
00:28:14.317,00:28:16.236,I wish I'd had a father like you.
00:28:20.115,00:28:23.118,"Why don't you quit blubbering and get our signal fire lit, huh?"
00:28:26.996,00:28:29.624,"-What the hell did you do here? -Yeah, sorry about that."
00:28:30.709,00:28:31.835,Give me a minute.
00:28:36.631,00:28:40.093,-Hang on to something. -Yeah? Why?
00:28:41.344,00:28:42.679,We might blow up.
00:28:44.097,00:28:45.181,Whoa!
00:28:46.558,00:28:48.017,I'm picking up something hot.
00:28:48.476,00:28:51.312,-You girls ready with the harpoon? -Ready.
00:29:19.048,00:29:21.843,Hey. Nice hydrazine fire you've got there.
00:29:21.926,00:29:24.345,Hey! I knew you'd find us.
00:29:24.429,00:29:25.638,It was a group effort.
00:29:29.768,00:29:30.935,-Dad? -Dad.
00:29:32.937,00:29:35.064,"You're not allowed to do that to us again, okay?"
00:29:35.982,00:29:37.484,I knew you'd be fine.
00:29:41.488,00:29:48.828,-Are you... Were you crying? -No. Maybe. I mean-- So what happened?
00:29:51.873,00:29:53.750,Let's just get you out of the cold.
00:30:03.384,00:30:05.887,-We close enough? -Almost in range.
00:30:09.390,00:30:10.225,Listen.
00:30:12.685,00:30:14.354,When did the pounding stop?
00:30:17.148,00:30:18.483,"-in 20 seconds. -Come on, come on."
00:30:34.749,00:30:36.835,-Target out of range. -We gotta run.
00:30:46.761,00:30:49.806,"Hey, Maureen! Maureen!"
00:30:50.682,00:30:53.810,"You stabbed me in the back, Maureen."
00:30:57.438,00:30:58.815,Our fuel's gone.
00:31:00.733,00:31:02.193,The Resolute's gone.
00:31:06.155,00:31:09.075,"I'm stuck here, drifting nowhere till I die."
00:31:15.832,00:31:17.458,And all because of you.
00:31:25.383,00:31:27.260,You and your family.
00:32:13.765,00:32:15.475,-Mom? -Get in now.
00:32:17.602,00:32:20.563,Seal the doors. It'll maintain pressure long enough.
00:32:20.647,00:32:23.024,"-Mom, we can help you. -Stay in there!"
00:32:27.362,00:32:28.613,"Hey, where's Will?"
00:32:38.039,00:32:42.418,"No, get out of there! No! Will! Hide!"
00:32:43.127,00:32:47.715,You know who I am. It's me.
00:32:59.602,00:33:01.062,And we're friends.
00:33:19.372,00:33:21.124,Get away from my kids!
00:33:23.835,00:33:26.963,Go! Tie yourself onto there.
00:33:33.052,00:33:35.471,-Hold on tight. Okay? -Yeah.
00:33:54.407,00:33:56.367,No! No! No!
00:34:23.644,00:34:24.854,Maybe I can jump for it.
00:34:40.203,00:34:42.121,What the hell is that?
00:35:09.732,00:35:11.025,What is that?
00:35:33.714,00:35:34.632,Judy!
00:35:50.064,00:35:52.984,-Why is it pointing at us? -Go!
00:35:53.985,00:35:55.736,You stay away from them!
00:37:21.614,00:37:23.157,I knew it was still you.
00:37:26.869,00:37:30.456,"Yeah. Yeah, friends."
00:38:34.729,00:38:36.647,-in T-minus two minutes. -Mom.
00:38:36.731,00:38:39.900,"-Will, are you okay? -Yeah, I will be."
00:38:48.367,00:38:50.619,There's a crack in the glass. We're losing air.
00:39:01.672,00:39:03.341,There's a manual crank outside.
00:39:05.551,00:39:06.552,"Will, you can't."
00:39:08.179,00:39:11.515,"-I have to. -Will, you can't!"
00:39:29.033,00:39:30.409,You be careful.
00:40:38.519,00:40:41.397,"Once I shut the door, I'll climb over to the rear airlock."
00:40:41.480,00:40:43.482,That's a long climb.
00:40:44.942,00:40:45.901,He knows.
00:40:47.111,00:40:48.070,It's gonna work.
00:41:13.095,00:41:13.929,You did it.
00:41:16.724,00:41:19.852,"I did do it, didn't I?"
00:41:52.801,00:41:53.761,Ah!
00:41:55.387,00:41:57.306,No! No!
00:42:20.162,00:42:25.125,"-Dad! -I gotcha. I gotcha, buddy."
00:42:27.628,00:42:29.255,Come on. Let's go home.
00:42:45.187,00:42:50.234,"I have a scar too, buddy. Wraps all the way from my waist-- -All right. No. Uh-uh. -No!"
00:42:51.151,00:42:52.361,Seventeen stitches.
00:42:52.778,00:42:54.363,Used my best bottle of whiskey to clean it up.
00:43:14.008,00:43:15.509,There's no sign of the Resolute.
00:43:16.969,00:43:20.639,They're long gone. We're on our own.
00:43:23.809,00:43:25.394,At least we're all together.
00:43:26.895,00:43:28.230,We almost weren't.
00:43:38.240,00:43:39.199,Second time?
00:44:01.388,00:44:02.765,Why did you do that?
00:44:10.314,00:44:11.148,Do what?
00:44:11.231,00:44:14.818,Shoot the harpoon again so John could climb back on the ship.
00:44:19.490,00:44:20.908,Because I was sorry.
00:44:22.951,00:44:27.081,I still am. About everything.
00:44:27.831,00:44:29.041,"Are you, really?"
00:44:32.461,00:44:34.838,I said it 'cause it was the right thing to say.
00:44:41.178,00:44:44.181,There's no way I'm letting you out again.
00:44:56.568,00:44:57.778,We'll see.
00:45:19.133,00:45:22.177,"So, what are our options?"
00:45:26.473,00:45:34.523,"If we ration our supplies, we could maybe survive long enough for the heat to subside and we could land again."
00:45:37.776,00:45:39.570,Land back down there?
00:46:00.090,00:46:01.341,Maureen.
00:46:11.143,00:46:12.269,It's the Resolute!
00:46:20.235,00:46:21.528,You waited for us.
00:46:21.987,00:46:26.867,"John, I represent every member of this colonist group, even you."
00:46:31.580,00:46:32.498,Victor...
00:46:34.208,00:46:35.459,thank you.
00:46:36.043,00:46:37.044,You're welcome.
00:46:40.422,00:46:42.674,"Quickly, please. We've stayed longer than we should."
00:47:08.784,00:47:10.953,It's the noise the robot's ship was making.
00:47:11.578,00:47:13.372,So why is our ship making it?
00:48:43.754,00:48:45.130,I think we're here.
00:48:46.423,00:48:47.507,Where's here?
00:48:56.433,00:48:57.476,Danger.
