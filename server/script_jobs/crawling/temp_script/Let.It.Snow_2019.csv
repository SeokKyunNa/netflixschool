00:00:15.958,00:00:20.583,"in Laurel, Illinois, but this year, we're lucky."
00:00:25.625,00:00:28.375,Sometimes snow can really kick you in the ass.
00:00:28.791,00:00:31.250,But it's beautiful and it's magical.
00:00:32.791,00:00:37.541,"And trust me, a little bit of snow can make a big difference."
00:00:50.375,00:00:52.708,"Make sure the doors are locked. Take care of yourself, okay?"
00:00:53.250,00:00:54.583,-Love you. -Love you.
00:00:57.666,00:01:00.125,Snow can change the way you look at the world.
00:01:03.583,00:01:06.583,Or hide the things that are right in front of you.
00:01:36.416,00:01:46.958,"Selling out Chicago's Allstate Arena last night at just 20 years old, huge thanks to Stuart Bale for coming in. Uh, before we lose ya, any big plans for the holidays?"
00:01:47.916,00:01:49.458,I'm still figuring it out.
00:02:09.458,00:02:15.333,"and especially on Christmas Eve, that's exactly what we need."
00:02:31.750,00:02:34.000,"-Next! -Uh, hi. Uh..."
00:02:34.708,00:02:37.625,I'm looking for a New England Farmhand Elf.
00:02:37.916,00:02:38.750,Volume Two.
00:02:38.833,00:02:42.916,"I ordered it online, but made the mistake of ordering a Volume One."
00:02:43.750,00:02:47.625,What you need is a time machine to go back to August when I had some.
00:02:54.041,00:02:56.083,My mom's entire Christmas kind of depends on it.
00:02:56.166,00:02:57.291,On Christmas Eve?
00:03:00.958,00:03:01.791,Next!
00:03:06.291,00:03:07.208,Ta-da!
00:03:07.625,00:03:09.375,"Remind me again, your DJ name is..."
00:03:09.750,00:03:10.750,K-Pow?
00:03:10.833,00:03:11.666,Is it Kapow?
00:03:11.750,00:03:15.458,"No, no. It's DJ K-Star-Pow-Money."
00:03:15.541,00:03:16.708,It's so obvious.
00:03:16.791,00:03:18.666,It looks like a text a baby would send.
00:03:18.750,00:03:22.791,"Yeah, well, show me the baby that got DJ Tempest to come to his party."
00:03:22.875,00:03:24.000,His name is Rob.
00:03:24.375,00:03:25.750,Just like a regular name.
00:03:25.833,00:03:30.125,And just 'cause he DJs the Circus Circus pool party doesn't mean he gets to rename himself Tempest.
00:03:30.208,00:03:35.708,"Look, he's coming to the party and if he likes the set, he's gonna hook me up with DJ gigs and that's one step closer to my dream."
00:03:35.791,00:03:39.083,"-Bam! -So, I locked everything breakable -in your father's office. -Oh."
00:03:39.166,00:03:41.875,"Oh, what about that lamp? Someone could break that."
00:03:44.416,00:03:46.333,I'll be at yours in an hour. I'm picking up chips.
00:03:46.416,00:03:47.375,What's your dip pairing?
00:03:47.458,00:03:49.416,"It's Movie Marathon Day, so..."
00:03:52.500,00:03:54.500,Imma get my face in that cheese.
00:03:54.583,00:03:56.875,"Imma eat so much cheese, Imma give myself a heart condition."
00:03:58.583,00:04:01.041,"Oh, my God. We must stop. All right."
00:04:01.625,00:04:04.208,"Bye, K-Star-Dollar-Sign-Pop-Money-Crunch!"
00:04:04.291,00:04:05.708,Bye! I hate you!
00:04:08.333,00:04:09.375,"Woof, man."
00:04:10.083,00:04:12.791,-My balls just retracted into my body. -What?
00:04:12.875,00:04:14.250,Tell her that you like her.
00:04:17.708,00:04:18.916,"You know, I'm going to."
00:04:20.375,00:04:21.208,Today.
00:04:21.833,00:04:22.958,I'm gonna do it today.
00:04:24.125,00:04:24.958,Movie Day.
00:04:25.458,00:04:27.666,Is that official? Can I get that in writing?
00:04:28.416,00:04:31.208,"I've known her since I was five years old, man. It's not that easy."
00:04:34.708,00:04:38.375,"You just have to tell her you want the same relationship, plus boning."
00:04:38.958,00:04:40.458,"Yeah? That's pretty good, man."
00:04:40.541,00:04:42.375,"Hey, let me get a pen and write that down, huh?"
00:04:42.458,00:04:44.291,All I'm saying is you need to live in the truth.
00:04:44.375,00:04:48.958,There's nothing better than to live in-- Tobin!
00:04:49.416,00:04:50.250,What are you doing?
00:04:50.333,00:04:53.166,I'm not gonna drink until I graduate from college with honors.
00:04:56.916,00:04:59.125,Flight got canceled. Too much snow.
00:05:05.625,00:05:07.250,"Here. You should go, Tobin."
00:05:15.083,00:05:16.041,So sorry.
00:05:19.916,00:05:21.958,I don't get it. Why haven't you texted her?
00:05:22.041,00:05:26.125,"Dude, I've written and rewritten, like, 800 texts to her in the last two weeks."
00:05:26.500,00:05:27.958,Let me see that picture of her again.
00:05:32.333,00:05:34.541,"-Okay, she's very, very cute. -Isn't she?"
00:05:35.208,00:05:36.625,"Okay, we should get going."
00:05:36.708,00:05:38.666,I'm dying to show you this present I'm getting you.
00:05:38.750,00:05:43.375,"I just have to make sure you like it, 'cause it's a pretty pig commitment."
00:05:43.458,00:05:45.791,"Wait, a pig commitment? Is that a clue?"
00:05:45.875,00:05:50.916,"It's the summation of everything we have been obsessed with -since we were 12. -Oh, my God! I can't wait!"
00:06:01.125,00:06:04.458,"Yeah, he didn't only like it, he also commented a squid and piano emoji."
00:06:06.458,00:06:07.541,Wonder what that means.
00:06:07.875,00:06:08.916,"Yeah, I don't know."
00:06:09.041,00:06:10.916,"Let's go, 'cause I have to be at work after."
00:06:15.708,00:06:16.791,"Like, what is that?"
00:06:16.875,00:06:18.541,"Could be a joke, from Debate."
00:06:18.625,00:06:21.291,Yeah. They're probably debating whether or not to bang right now.
00:06:22.583,00:06:23.666,And look at his smile.
00:06:23.750,00:06:25.458,"Okay, so he's smiling. So what?"
00:06:29.250,00:06:30.416,He's gonna break up with me.
00:06:30.500,00:06:34.041,"Ads, he would have to be the dumbest human being on Earth to do that."
00:06:34.125,00:06:37.416,"Like, dumber than the people who blow on ice cream before they eat it."
00:06:38.041,00:06:39.458,He's not gonna break up with you.
00:06:39.791,00:06:40.666,I swear.
00:06:41.083,00:06:41.916,Hmm?
00:06:46.958,00:06:50.000,"Check it out. Tin Foil Woman, in the flesh."
00:06:51.625,00:06:54.583,Tyler P. saw a NASA pin on the back of her truck. Proves it.
00:06:54.791,00:06:57.166,"She was the first woman on the space shuttle, but got booted."
00:06:57.458,00:06:58.291,No way.
00:06:58.458,00:07:00.166,She's on the run for murdering a loan shark.
00:07:02.083,00:07:05.625,Or she thinks she's a burrito and that the Earth is a giant microwave.
00:07:05.958,00:07:07.416,I think she's something cool.
00:07:08.583,00:07:10.291,"D, she's wearing sandwich wrap."
00:07:10.666,00:07:13.708,So? Maybe she doesn't care what people think of her.
00:07:14.416,00:07:15.958,"Well, she should."
00:07:17.291,00:07:23.041,"Or maybe she cares what the important people in her life think, not people she has to chase."
00:07:24.166,00:07:25.958,I'm not chasing anyone.
00:07:26.416,00:07:28.333,"I'm in a relationship, so I care."
00:07:29.041,00:07:31.208,I know that could be hard for you to understand.
00:07:42.250,00:07:44.208,Jeb's house is right around the corner.
00:07:44.833,00:07:46.541,"So, I'm just gonna go."
00:07:56.250,00:07:58.500,"That was what I wanted to show you, by the way."
00:08:25.750,00:08:27.916,"Um, excuse me..."
00:08:30.916,00:08:33.083,"Look, um... not right now, okay?"
00:08:33.166,00:08:36.041,"I'm-- I'm really trying to stay low-key, so..."
00:08:36.625,00:08:37.708,You dropped this.
00:08:41.666,00:08:42.625,Uh...
00:08:46.916,00:08:53.166,"-I'm so sorry. -Look, even if I was into your music, I'm not the type to throw myself at someone just because they're famous."
00:08:58.291,00:08:59.250,That was the train.
00:09:08.916,00:09:10.958,"Oh, my God. Was that Stuart Bale?"
00:09:13.291,00:09:14.583,I really don't care.
00:09:15.458,00:09:17.166,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. Neither do I."
00:09:18.375,00:09:21.750,I just have a friend who'd like to do bad things to him.
00:09:50.916,00:09:52.041,"Hey, what's up?"
00:09:52.125,00:09:54.541,"Um, I'm up, thanks. I'm good. Yeah, I'm good."
00:09:55.958,00:09:56.791,Okay.
00:09:57.208,00:09:58.916,See you downstairs when you've found a bra.
00:10:10.875,00:10:14.958,"Do we want to watch movies the entire time, or-- I was thinking the same thing."
00:10:15.041,00:10:16.375,Totally up for a change.
00:10:18.000,00:10:20.250,-Speaking of which-- -Your chest is bleeding.
00:10:22.666,00:10:23.500,Oh.
00:10:24.250,00:10:25.708,"Yeah, I was doing push-ups..."
00:10:26.500,00:10:27.958,over... mm... glass.
00:10:28.375,00:10:30.166,-You were doing push-ups? -Mm-hmm.
00:10:30.416,00:10:31.416,Over broken glass?
00:10:31.500,00:10:33.000,Yup. It motivates me.
00:10:34.625,00:10:37.125,-You don't know everything about me. -I kinda do.
00:10:41.291,00:10:42.125,So...
00:10:43.583,00:10:45.166,Do you remember JP Lapierre?
00:10:48.041,00:10:49.541,Soccer captain from the grade above us?
00:10:49.625,00:10:53.958,"Yeah. Anyway, he's home and he invited us to his college friend's party today."
00:10:54.041,00:10:55.375,"-Us? -Well, I mean..."
00:10:55.916,00:10:57.333,"he invited me, but..."
00:10:58.041,00:10:59.166,Would you wanna go?
00:11:00.041,00:11:02.166,With you and JP Lapierre?
00:11:02.250,00:11:10.166,"I-- I don't know, I think it could be fun, but like, if you're down. If you're not down, I-- If you don't wanna go, it's fine, but I-- No, no. You know, if-- I mean, if you want to go, then..."
00:11:10.916,00:11:12.458,Really appreciate a buddy.
00:11:12.541,00:11:15.041,Totally. I am that.
00:11:17.666,00:11:20.083,"Seriously, I am getting a Band-Aid for your boob."
00:11:29.125,00:11:30.333,Did she get a little work done?
00:11:33.833,00:11:34.916,and her side panels buffed.
00:11:35.000,00:11:35.958,Tastefully done.
00:11:36.083,00:11:37.416,-Hmm. -You can hardly tell.
00:11:45.500,00:11:48.541,We are doing everything we can to get us moving as soon as possible.
00:11:51.041,00:11:53.166,Conductor says we'll be here at least an hour.
00:11:53.500,00:11:56.750,"He also called me sir, which answers my concerns about this shirt."
00:11:58.500,00:12:01.166,This is ridiculous. I live just over that hill.
00:12:04.375,00:12:07.375,"Just so you know, I'm not stalking you, I'm going home."
00:12:07.458,00:12:09.583,"I'm just going to that restaurant, so..."
00:12:09.666,00:12:10.750,I'll call TMZ.
00:12:23.583,00:12:24.458,Hey.
00:12:32.625,00:12:35.375,Feels good to be in the real world for a few hours.
00:12:36.000,00:12:41.916,"You know, if the train made you feel real, Waffle Town is gonna blow your mind."
00:12:52.583,00:12:54.083,I thought you had the day off.
00:12:56.625,00:12:57.833,The universe is against me.
00:12:58.166,00:12:59.208,"It's not possible, dude."
00:12:59.291,00:13:02.166,The universe is not some wicked lady. The universe is one infinite hug.
00:13:03.083,00:13:09.916,"First, my party gets shut down by my parents, and then he calls me because Janet-- She's going through a really rough time right now."
00:13:10.458,00:13:11.416,Dirty-ass Janet...
00:13:12.125,00:13:15.833,has her car stuck in the driveway? Snowed in? That's so-- Selfish.
00:13:15.916,00:13:16.791,Thank you.
00:13:17.791,00:13:19.166,I really need to have this party.
00:13:20.041,00:13:21.916,Wait. Addie's mom's away!
00:13:22.000,00:13:23.875,-Addie's mom's always away. -Yeah!
00:13:27.166,00:13:29.166,"Okay, first, chill. Second, no."
00:13:29.708,00:13:31.125,Addie is preoccupied.
00:13:32.166,00:13:33.666,What do you mean? Where is he?
00:13:34.083,00:13:35.125,He got picked up.
00:13:36.083,00:13:37.333,"Uh, picked up by who?"
00:13:37.666,00:13:40.750,I don't know. He told my mom he was going to the Waffle Town.
00:13:41.333,00:13:42.833,Was he picked up by a girl?
00:13:43.416,00:13:46.250,"A bunch of people, but yeah, a girl was driving."
00:13:47.333,00:13:48.458,I knew it.
00:13:53.041,00:13:53.916,Affle Town.
00:13:56.500,00:13:59.083,"If you're a fan of coffee, do not order one here."
00:13:59.916,00:14:03.250,Then maybe we should grab a waffle.
00:14:04.208,00:14:05.083,What?
00:14:05.583,00:14:06.416,Why?
00:14:07.625,00:14:08.458,Um...
00:14:08.791,00:14:12.833,I mean it would be terrible if I got photographed in an Awful Town alone.
00:14:13.083,00:14:14.833,"Listen, no offense..."
00:14:15.583,00:14:16.708,I just don't like this place.
00:14:17.708,00:14:20.083,"All right, look. I called my car already."
00:14:21.375,00:14:22.416,You have a hard out.
00:14:26.083,00:14:26.958,One waffle.
00:14:32.416,00:14:33.708,Holy shit.
00:14:34.291,00:14:36.333,"Uh... Stuart, this is Billy."
00:14:38.000,00:14:38.833,Hi.
00:14:40.583,00:14:42.583,I was hoping for some breakfast.
00:14:49.375,00:14:51.416,"You, uh, really gonna eat all that?"
00:14:51.500,00:14:53.458,"Oh, yeah, I don't waste any food."
00:14:54.000,00:14:54.833,Like...
00:14:55.125,00:14:56.583,-ever? -Ever.
00:14:56.916,00:14:59.166,What if you're eating something and it falls on the floor?
00:14:59.250,00:15:00.958,Then I feed it to my dog.
00:15:01.041,00:15:02.291,What if your dog isn't around?
00:15:02.833,00:15:04.250,Then I locate a dog.
00:15:04.333,00:15:05.750,What if you're on a dog-free island?
00:15:05.833,00:15:07.916,You're doing a concert on a dog-free island somewhere.
00:15:08.000,00:15:12.291,I'm sure the island has other animals that eat food that falls on the floor.
00:15:12.375,00:15:13.208,Damn it.
00:15:13.583,00:15:14.500,You're probably right.
00:15:15.291,00:15:17.041,"So, why don't you ever waste food?"
00:15:19.000,00:15:20.208,"Hunger is, uh..."
00:15:21.500,00:15:23.250,"it's a thing for me, you know?"
00:15:24.583,00:15:26.458,Uh... a cause.
00:15:26.541,00:15:27.375,Why?
00:15:28.708,00:15:34.125,"You know, I'm a pretty important person, so I like to do a lot of, um... important charity work."
00:15:34.750,00:15:35.583,Come on.
00:15:38.416,00:15:39.250,I don't know.
00:15:39.333,00:15:41.791,I guess we didn't really grow up with a whole lot.
00:15:45.000,00:15:49.375,-I don't know if I want many carbs today. -I definitely want carbs.
00:15:50.375,00:15:52.875,"Oh, my God!"
00:15:58.083,00:15:59.916,Maybe the universe isn't against me.
00:16:00.000,00:16:02.958,Maybe it's telling me to-- To have my party here.
00:16:03.041,00:16:05.708,"The universe... always has the answer, Keon."
00:16:05.791,00:16:07.791,You just have to subscribe to her newsletter.
00:16:09.000,00:16:10.916,"Well, does that mean I can have my party here?"
00:16:11.000,00:16:12.833,Aren't you glad I called you in today?
00:16:16.166,00:16:24.875,"Okay, you're gonna have to clean up tomorrow, you're gonna have to play good music, and you're gonna have to give me a ride home, because I bicycled here this morning and it was real slip-slidey out there."
00:16:38.791,00:16:39.875,That girl and I...
00:16:40.916,00:16:42.333,"kinda had, like, a thing."
00:16:43.625,00:16:44.791,You-- You hooked up?
00:16:45.250,00:16:47.541,"Yeah, but I don't know, it was more than that, like..."
00:16:47.625,00:16:52.666,"Have you ever been with someone and you stay up until, like, 4:00 a.m., just talking about everything?"
00:16:52.958,00:17:00.583,"Like how you're both super scared of getting old and what it felt like the first time you saw The Goblet of Fire, and you're just like, I can't believe I get to exist at the same time as you?"
00:17:04.791,00:17:06.458,"I really, really liked her."
00:17:07.500,00:17:10.208,"The way she would, like, talk super fast when she got excited."
00:17:10.291,00:17:11.291,It was really cute.
00:17:14.916,00:17:15.833,I'm gonna do it.
00:17:16.416,00:17:17.250,I'm going over there.
00:17:17.333,00:17:19.458,"Play it cool, though. You know how to play it cool."
00:17:19.541,00:17:20.625,I can play it cool.
00:17:22.583,00:17:23.958,"Wait, how do you play it cool?"
00:17:24.041,00:17:25.458,-You just go over there... -Uh-huh.
00:17:25.541,00:17:28.375,...and then you ask her if her and her friends will stay for the party.
00:17:28.916,00:17:29.750,Okay.
00:17:30.375,00:17:31.208,You got this.
00:17:40.250,00:17:41.166,Hey!
00:17:42.458,00:17:44.000,How are you? What are you doing here?
00:17:44.958,00:17:46.083,"Um, hi."
00:17:46.166,00:17:50.041,It's so crazy. I was actually just thinking about you this morning when I was in the shower.
00:17:53.875,00:17:57.458,"No, 'cause I have, uh, one of those soaps that has a little toy in the center."
00:17:58.791,00:18:00.041,"It's not, I mean..."
00:18:00.541,00:18:02.625,I'm not like a toddler or anything.
00:18:02.708,00:18:05.583,"It's just one of those, like, let's bring back the '90s type things."
00:18:05.875,00:18:10.625,"Anyway, I got the toy out, finally, this morning, and, um, it was a horse!"
00:18:11.666,00:18:16.208,And I remember you said horses are just basically big dogs.
00:18:17.166,00:18:18.875,"So, uh, I thought of you."
00:18:21.166,00:18:23.875,"Okay, whatever. Can we, like, order now?"
00:18:25.083,00:18:25.958,Uh...
00:18:26.041,00:18:28.166,-I definitely want the waffle sandwich. -French toast.
00:18:28.250,00:18:34.416,"-Can I get the waffle bites? -And, like, the waffle-- I'm sorry. We'll get a couple orders of bacon, like, maybe four for the table?"
00:18:52.583,00:18:53.625,"Angie, you made it!"
00:18:57.041,00:18:58.833,"Uh, this is my friend, Tobin."
00:18:58.958,00:18:59.875,I know Tobin.
00:19:01.041,00:19:02.583,"Of course, you sat behind me in Physics."
00:19:03.041,00:19:06.625,"Yeah. Yeah, I mean... I know that, I just didn't think that you'd know that."
00:19:09.208,00:19:10.416,So you guys play broomball?
00:19:10.500,00:19:11.541,Love broomball.
00:19:12.583,00:19:15.041,"All right, sweet. You're on my team. Come on, man."
00:19:16.708,00:19:18.041,You love broomball?
00:19:19.000,00:19:21.583,I've never heard you once mention broomball.
00:19:21.666,00:19:23.916,Because I don't like talking about broomball.
00:19:24.625,00:19:25.833,I love playing broomball.
00:19:27.041,00:19:31.500,"I'm nice on the ice, which is a phrase other people have used to describe me and how good I am at broomball."
00:19:31.583,00:19:37.583,"Okay, because you usually never like to play sports, so-- It's a leisurely holiday pastime."
00:19:38.250,00:19:40.625,"Besides, who are we playing, the broomball Olympians?"
00:19:42.666,00:19:43.500,Holy shit.
00:19:43.583,00:19:44.416,We came to play!
00:19:44.500,00:19:45.958,You guys ready or what?
00:19:46.041,00:19:47.125,The Reston brothers?
00:19:47.500,00:19:49.666,This is their party? I thought they went to jail.
00:19:55.000,00:19:55.833,"Hey, man."
00:19:56.333,00:19:57.833,I saw you roll up in your pussy wagon.
00:20:20.583,00:20:22.583,"Gotta try and stay vertical, my man!"
00:20:22.666,00:20:24.875,"Ooh! Let's get you back out there, all right?"
00:20:25.500,00:20:26.458,Come on.
00:20:28.250,00:20:30.500,"Back up, back up! You got this, T! You got this, T!"
00:20:31.041,00:20:32.125,"Come on. Step up, step up!"
00:20:32.541,00:20:33.416,"T, look out!"
00:21:08.125,00:21:10.583,"-Oh, yeah, I'm not doing that. -Why? It takes like two seconds."
00:21:14.208,00:21:15.583,Wha-- What are you doing right now?
00:21:18.208,00:21:19.250,"Nothing, I'm just..."
00:21:22.375,00:21:36.083,"They-- They see me, but you know, you don't need to-- Ah, shit."
00:21:39.791,00:21:40.958,Men's bathroom window.
00:21:42.333,00:21:44.416,"Go. Go, go, go, go, go."
00:21:49.125,00:21:51.291,-Hey! -Was that Stuart Bale?
00:21:51.375,00:21:53.125,Mm... Yeah.
00:21:53.291,00:21:55.333,"Yeah, Stuart Bale is eating at the Waffle Town."
00:21:56.041,00:21:59.125,And Lady Gaga is just buying tampons at the Gas and Go. So...
00:22:00.625,00:22:04.500,"No, that was my-- That was my, uh, stepcousin Bryant..."
00:22:04.916,00:22:06.458,And his name is Bryant.
00:22:06.541,00:22:07.375,"Oh, really?"
00:22:07.541,00:22:09.666,Then why did he just run off to the bathroom?
00:22:09.750,00:22:11.625,"Well, why would you run to the bathroom?"
00:22:11.708,00:22:12.750,Oh. Ew!
00:22:16.041,00:22:20.708,I'm sure there's a way to do this and still look cool. Oh!
00:22:26.541,00:22:28.833,"Yeah, thanks uh... thanks for the help."
00:22:29.458,00:22:31.041,Any time. Okay.
00:22:31.833,00:22:32.875,I'm gonna go now.
00:22:35.583,00:22:37.958,"and totally bizarre and random to meet you, but..."
00:22:38.041,00:22:39.666,I gotta go. I have a lot to do.
00:22:42.000,00:22:43.000,Like meet my mom.
00:22:43.333,00:22:45.041,I-- Don't worry about it.
00:22:45.625,00:22:47.833,"I mean, I'm not worried, I'm... just..."
00:22:48.333,00:22:50.875,"Look, I have a lot to do. I have things to do."
00:22:52.500,00:22:55.833,"I have to make a decision that impacts the entire rest of my life, okay?"
00:23:00.375,00:23:02.541,I got into Columbia. In New York.
00:23:05.416,00:23:07.250,"Also, my mom is sick."
00:23:08.666,00:23:14.166,"And we don't know which way it's gonna go, so I have to stay and take care of her because this might be the last year I have with her."
00:23:15.000,00:23:18.083,"And I asked for a deferral, but they said I'd lose my scholarship."
00:23:21.041,00:23:23.500,Sorry for the... massive download.
00:23:23.583,00:23:26.041,I just haven't actually said that to anyone.
00:23:28.291,00:23:30.291,"Anyways, merry Christmas. I gotta go."
00:23:34.125,00:23:35.750,"I told you, I'm meeting my mom."
00:23:36.291,00:23:37.916,At our winter holiday pageant.
00:23:38.125,00:23:39.041,Sounds fun.
00:23:41.541,00:23:42.625,"Hey, this is Jeb."
00:24:03.458,00:24:04.291,Hey!
00:24:06.250,00:24:07.416,Hey!
00:24:13.000,00:24:14.041,"Yeah, can I help you?"
00:24:14.125,00:24:15.166,"Yes, please. Um..."
00:24:15.250,00:24:18.291,"I'm, like, stranded in the snow. Can you give me a ride to the Waffle Town?"
00:24:19.875,00:24:23.458,"Sure. Yeah, it's snowing. There's no buses running. Yeah, get in."
00:24:29.708,00:24:30.958,Are you crazy?
00:24:31.583,00:24:34.000,-Are you out of your mind? -What?
00:24:34.083,00:24:36.958,You don't go getting into people's cars you don't know!
00:24:37.041,00:24:38.500,Relax! I have my phone.
00:24:38.791,00:24:41.000,"Well, what the hell does that have to do with anything?"
00:24:41.083,00:24:43.541,"Like, if someone were to hurt me, I could call 911."
00:24:43.625,00:24:45.291,"Well, what if they took your phone?"
00:24:45.375,00:24:49.750,"Well, if the phone was still in the car, it's pinging off the cell towers and-- And tracking where I am."
00:24:49.833,00:24:51.916,"Oh, well, what good is that if you're murdered?"
00:24:52.000,00:24:55.000,"Well, hopefully that knowledge can be a deterrent to the murderer."
00:24:58.041,00:24:58.875,Okay.
00:25:00.375,00:25:03.208,"What were you doing out there all by yourself, anyway?"
00:25:03.291,00:25:04.875,My best friend left me.
00:25:05.083,00:25:07.125,Sounds like a great best friend.
00:25:07.208,00:25:08.708,"Okay, she didn't leave me."
00:25:08.791,00:25:11.083,I was in a situation she didn't understand.
00:25:11.583,00:25:14.625,My boyfriend's being weird. He's not answering any of my texts.
00:25:18.791,00:25:20.041,"He knows where I am, though."
00:25:21.041,00:25:23.166,"Oh, my God, now you're scared?"
00:25:24.000,00:25:26.083,You have terrible instincts.
00:25:26.625,00:25:27.958,Has anyone ever told you that?
00:25:28.875,00:25:32.250,It's 'cause you're relying on that thing instead of yourself.
00:25:42.583,00:25:50.791,Mine collects elves I'll just be at the hotel.
00:25:52.541,00:25:53.916,Christmas in a hotel?
00:25:54.750,00:25:56.750,I'm used to it. I travel a lot.
00:25:56.833,00:25:58.000,Do you like it?
00:25:58.166,00:26:04.583,"Honestly, I really would love to be in one place, just for a little while."
00:26:04.666,00:26:07.000,"Well, maybe we just, uh, we switch."
00:26:07.958,00:26:09.875,Singing and dancing can't be that hard.
00:26:09.958,00:26:11.958,Okay. I'll send you my set list.
00:26:14.791,00:26:16.958,So why your mom like Christmas so much?
00:26:18.583,00:26:19.416,Uh...
00:26:20.500,00:26:21.333,I think...
00:26:22.416,00:26:30.291,"you know, it's 'cause my-- My dad, he left in between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and now my mom kind of wants Christmas to be..."
00:26:31.208,00:26:34.208,amazing and spectacular and...
00:26:34.916,00:26:35.750,for me.
00:26:36.791,00:26:37.833,That's sweet.
00:26:38.666,00:26:39.916,"Kind of, I guess."
00:26:45.458,00:26:47.916,It's like the perfect holiday card.
00:26:49.291,00:26:51.208,It's like the Spanx of weather.
00:26:54.166,00:26:55.500,So where did you grow up?
00:26:56.208,00:26:58.750,Ah. Guessing most people already know that about you.
00:27:04.958,00:27:06.333,I grew up in Atlanta.
00:27:08.208,00:27:09.750,I grew up more of a loner.
00:27:10.375,00:27:12.583,"But I had music, so... it was cool."
00:27:13.166,00:27:14.833,But my dad didn't really like it.
00:27:15.583,00:27:17.708,He was real strict.
00:27:18.458,00:27:22.833,"I mean even now, he doesn't think music is a real job and..."
00:27:23.208,00:27:24.458,Have you told him it is?
00:27:26.666,00:27:27.666,The point is...
00:27:29.250,00:27:31.291,"you can do a lot worse than this place, trust me."
00:27:39.416,00:27:40.541,The Reston brothers?
00:27:40.916,00:27:42.166,I thought they were in prison.
00:27:42.458,00:27:43.875,"Well, apparently not."
00:27:43.958,00:27:45.750,"Dude, get away from them."
00:27:48.208,00:27:50.375,and we're here so The Duke can hang out with JP Lapierre.
00:27:53.208,00:27:57.000,-Hello? -That was a moment of silence for your hopes of ever being with The Duke.
00:27:57.083,00:27:59.333,"Thanks, man. That's-- That helps."
00:27:59.958,00:28:04.416,"Especially since he just finished telling us about his semester in Kenya, building schools and stuff."
00:28:04.500,00:28:07.791,"Dude, if she's hooking up with JP Lapierre-- They're not hooking up."
00:28:10.000,00:28:10.833,Yet.
00:28:13.375,00:28:14.500,"I can't leave here, man."
00:28:15.625,00:28:18.083,I'm having my party at the Awful Town. I need you to bring beer!
00:28:18.166,00:28:22.000,"I have dancers here, okay? You get here, we'll have drink."
00:28:22.416,00:28:28.875,"-Okay, I think I have a plan. -Thank you. You see? I just-- Hey, man, I just want to apologize for them. That wasn't cool."
00:28:30.583,00:28:33.500,"You can be reasonable and calm about it, but I'm not."
00:28:33.875,00:28:35.625,It's not okay what they did to you.
00:28:37.083,00:28:39.416,"You bottle up all that emotion, it turns into anxiety."
00:28:39.750,00:28:42.041,"Recently, I started doing this Qigong meditation."
00:28:42.208,00:28:43.291,I'm sure you've heard of it.
00:28:43.583,00:28:46.791,"Yeah, you-- I mean, I've heard of... meditation."
00:28:46.875,00:28:50.625,"Anyway, it's this type of mind-body exercise, really great for martial arts training."
00:28:53.000,00:28:54.166,"Thanks, man."
00:28:56.333,00:28:57.833,"What do you say we get out of here, huh?"
00:28:58.291,00:28:59.916,"-Uh, yeah, I'm down. -Same."
00:29:00.000,00:29:01.791,Cool. And we're taking their keg.
00:29:11.583,00:29:12.416,Let's go!
00:29:12.750,00:29:14.458,"-Come on, buddy. -Go, go, go, go!"
00:29:15.791,00:29:16.625,Shit!
00:29:16.708,00:29:17.958,"You're dead, man!"
00:29:18.041,00:29:19.625,-You're dead! -That's our keg!
00:29:19.708,00:29:21.291,"-The car, man! -They're dead!"
00:29:21.375,00:29:23.666,"-Hit it, hit it! Whoo! -Go, go, go, go, go!"
00:29:40.458,00:29:42.125,"-Floor it, T-bird! -I'm trying!"
00:29:50.833,00:29:51.833,Why are we slowing down?
00:29:56.166,00:29:57.750,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
00:30:00.458,00:30:01.791,"-Wait. -Oh, God!"
00:30:02.416,00:30:03.250,"-Okay. -Oh, God!"
00:30:06.416,00:30:07.583,Incoming!
00:30:07.666,00:30:08.833,"Get it, man!"
00:30:10.291,00:30:12.458,"Come on, Carla! Don't be a little bitch!"
00:30:12.541,00:30:15.333,"Yeah, Carla! Work that ass like I know you can!"
00:30:15.416,00:30:18.458,"Guys, I know it's a car, but I'm also a feminist, so..."
00:30:21.083,00:30:22.041,-Oh! -Ooh!
00:30:22.125,00:30:23.000,"Go on, man!"
00:30:23.416,00:30:24.375,Gosh!
00:30:27.333,00:30:29.208,"-Okay. Come on, let's go. -Right, we're moving."
00:30:30.875,00:30:33.625,"They're right behind us, bud. Come on! Come on, Carla! Come on!"
00:30:35.250,00:30:36.666,-Right here! -Turn right!
00:30:48.666,00:30:50.833,"-Oh, my God! -Yeah! Whoo!"
00:30:50.916,00:30:52.208,"Way to go, T-man!"
00:30:57.250,00:30:58.750,That was insane!
00:31:01.458,00:31:03.416,Wow! Some action hero shit!
00:31:08.375,00:31:09.791,-What's happening? -Press the brake!
00:31:09.875,00:31:11.958,I'm trying to press the brake. I am pressing the brake!
00:31:20.250,00:31:21.333,Everyone all right?
00:31:26.208,00:31:28.083,Dude? Dude?
00:31:29.125,00:31:30.708,I think your nipple's bleeding.
00:32:00.291,00:32:23.708,"I just want to say I don't really know what that was back there, but-- I have not stopped thinking about you."
00:32:37.000,00:32:40.208,-I want to go sledding. -What? Now?
00:32:40.666,00:32:41.500,Yeah.
00:32:42.083,00:32:43.208,You don't have a sled.
00:32:45.166,00:32:46.041,Young moms.
00:32:47.291,00:32:48.416,That's my sweet spot.
00:32:54.166,00:32:56.583,"Yeah, you guys mind if I borrow your sled?"
00:33:03.708,00:33:04.541,Boom!
00:33:04.625,00:33:06.916,All right. Very nice to meet you.
00:33:10.458,00:33:11.458,Got us a loaner.
00:33:17.791,00:33:18.625,"Is, uh..."
00:33:19.291,00:33:20.166,that okay?
00:33:26.583,00:33:27.416,Wait!
00:33:31.333,00:33:32.375,Look...
00:33:33.041,00:33:34.291,anything can happen.
00:33:35.666,00:33:36.500,Good...
00:33:38.125,00:33:39.041,bad...
00:33:40.875,00:33:41.708,anything.
00:33:46.750,00:33:48.208,-Let's go. -Let's go.
00:34:26.333,00:34:27.333,Ooh!
00:34:30.333,00:34:31.250,Stuart!
00:35:17.083,00:35:19.625,"-So, I'm guessing it went well. -Ah."
00:35:19.958,00:35:22.416,And did she say they're gonna stay for the party?
00:35:22.500,00:35:23.333,Well...
00:35:26.625,00:35:28.750,"But yeah, I think they're staying."
00:35:29.125,00:35:31.666,"Okay, great, great! So, body count."
00:35:31.958,00:35:37.208,"Six dancers, if they stay, ...and then Tobin..."
00:35:40.708,00:35:42.291,Is that too little? Is that weird?
00:35:42.375,00:35:43.958,-Do you think that's weird? -What?
00:35:46.916,00:35:49.375,It's a tow truck in a snowstorm.
00:35:49.458,00:35:50.708,"No, it does not."
00:35:56.583,00:35:58.541,The answer is not in there.
00:35:59.583,00:36:02.375,It's like you're standing on a whale fishing for minnows.
00:36:03.375,00:36:05.166,What? That's a weird metaphor.
00:36:05.250,00:36:06.166,-You know what? -Hey!
00:36:06.250,00:36:08.083,You need to look around at the actual world!
00:36:08.166,00:36:09.666,You don't know what I need.
00:36:09.750,00:36:12.166,"And if you don't give my phone back, I'm gonna call the police."
00:36:12.250,00:36:13.833,"Oh, yeah, really? With what?"
00:36:15.083,00:36:19.791,"-Uh-oh! -Okay! All right, how would you feel -if I just took your tinfoil hat? -Hey!"
00:36:22.666,00:36:26.000,"I don't know why you wear that thing, but I'm pretty sure you're attached."
00:36:26.958,00:36:28.541,"There are theories, you know."
00:36:30.791,00:36:33.458,"About you, your hat, your past."
00:36:33.916,00:36:35.875,"NASCAR driver, ex-cop..."
00:36:37.166,00:36:38.291,baked potato.
00:36:38.375,00:36:41.291,"Well, what does your magic phone say is the correct one?"
00:36:41.375,00:36:42.875,What is it with old people and phones?
00:36:42.958,00:36:44.875,You know all the things I can do with that phone?
00:36:44.958,00:36:47.750,Do you know that I could read a book? Write an essay?
00:36:48.083,00:36:50.333,"Learn Spanish, track my steps?"
00:36:50.500,00:37:00.916,"Absorb the fact that Jeb has literally never liked any picture I've posted of us, and that he's going to break up with me on Christmas and start dating Madison, who he's currently with at the Waffle Town, which I know thanks to Bahar Rizwell's Snapchat!"
00:37:06.166,00:37:08.000,Can you do all of that with your magic hat?
00:37:09.916,00:37:11.041,That's what I thought.
00:37:13.458,00:37:14.958,-I'm gonna take my phone. Hey! -Hey! No!
00:37:15.291,00:37:17.375,"Hey, missy! Hey, hey, hey!"
00:37:21.666,00:37:24.208,No!
00:37:32.166,00:37:33.875,I'm sorry about that.
00:37:42.875,00:37:44.625,Why does everybody call you The Duke?
00:37:44.791,00:37:46.958,"Oh, it's Tobin's fault."
00:37:47.208,00:37:48.041,Why is that?
00:37:48.125,00:37:50.666,"Growing up, I was always one of the boys."
00:37:51.083,00:37:53.333,Tobin thought I should be distinguished for that.
00:37:53.416,00:37:55.333,"He's an original, I'll give him that."
00:37:56.083,00:37:57.875,He must do pretty well with the ladies.
00:37:57.958,00:37:58.791,Tobin?
00:37:59.958,00:38:00.791,No.
00:38:01.375,00:38:02.208,"No, not really."
00:38:03.875,00:38:06.750,"...I think when he gets to college, that's gonna change."
00:38:11.166,00:38:12.375,Tow truck's on its way.
00:38:20.166,00:38:21.666,She died doing what she loved.
00:38:22.583,00:38:24.416,Getting really low gas mileage.
00:38:27.125,00:38:29.041,"Shit, guys, it's the twins. Come on!"
00:38:29.333,00:38:30.291,"Get down, get down."
00:38:30.750,00:38:31.583,Get down.
00:38:38.250,00:38:39.666,All right. Let's get off the road.
00:39:00.791,00:39:03.000,Can't believe I'm hiding out in a church.
00:39:06.333,00:39:08.333,"Oh, my God, Tobin, play something."
00:39:15.916,00:39:17.625,"Tobe, play Whole of the Moon."
00:41:46.083,00:41:48.208,"Tobin, should we play Sound and Vision?"
00:41:48.625,00:41:50.083,"No, I'm-- I'm all good."
00:41:50.375,00:41:52.125,"-Oh, come on, man. One more. -What?"
00:41:52.208,00:41:54.583,"No, I think I'm gonna go check on Carla."
00:41:54.750,00:41:57.625,"-The guys are probably gone by now, so-- -Wait, wait, wait, we can all go."
00:41:57.708,00:41:58.666,I'm gonna go alone.
00:42:02.416,00:42:03.958,"Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?"
00:42:05.416,00:42:06.958,-Hey. -What?
00:42:07.958,00:42:09.541,What? What do you mean What?
00:42:09.625,00:42:10.625,You're being weird.
00:42:10.708,00:42:13.000,-Leaving suddenly and-- -How is that weird?
00:42:14.083,00:42:15.708,-Tobin. -Angie.
00:42:16.458,00:42:17.791,Why are you calling me Angie?
00:42:17.875,00:42:20.416,"Well, isn't that-- Isn't that what you like to be called? Mm?"
00:42:20.500,00:42:22.375,"God, since when did you get so sensitive?"
00:42:23.541,00:42:25.666,"Okay, are you mad about JP?"
00:42:26.041,00:42:27.916,Why would I be mad about JP?
00:42:31.041,00:42:32.000,Are you jealous?
00:42:32.500,00:42:34.500,"Yeah. Yeah, Angie."
00:42:34.958,00:42:36.708,I'm jealous of JP.
00:42:37.208,00:42:40.791,"I'm jealous of the enlightened, broomball-playing, meditating college boy."
00:42:44.250,00:42:45.083,Fine.
00:42:47.333,00:42:48.375,Be that way.
00:43:02.041,00:43:02.916,Shit.
00:43:04.750,00:43:05.666,You a wise man?
00:43:07.458,00:43:09.125,Are you one of our three wise men?
00:43:09.291,00:43:10.541,"Yes, I'm a wise man."
00:43:11.208,00:43:12.041,Great.
00:43:23.375,00:43:24.291,No fair!
00:43:26.333,00:43:28.333,"Um, we didn't order that."
00:43:28.416,00:43:31.208,"-Oh, I know. It's-- -Also, what is that?"
00:43:31.291,00:43:32.500,I call it a Quaffle Waffle.
00:43:32.583,00:43:34.833,Best enjoyed with a tall glass of Butterbeer.
00:43:37.083,00:43:39.333,-What? -It's from Harry Potter!
00:43:39.416,00:43:40.791,"Isn't that, like, for children?"
00:43:41.833,00:43:43.875,I'm pretty sure it's universally beloved.
00:43:49.458,00:43:54.291,"Also, I'm supposed to tell you guys that there's gonna be a party here later, so..."
00:43:55.083,00:43:56.000,you should stay.
00:43:59.166,00:44:01.041,"Um, can I get another iced tea?"
00:44:09.083,00:44:11.625,Because Tempest just texted me and he said he's gonna roll through.
00:44:12.791,00:44:13.875,This is so messed up.
00:44:18.541,00:44:19.375,It's nothing.
00:44:24.000,00:44:28.708,"tell my mom about Columbia, so when you meet her, -just don't mention anything. -Why didn't you tell your mom?"
00:44:28.791,00:44:32.791,"Because I didn't want her to worry, and also, try to convince me to go, so..."
00:44:34.833,00:44:35.666,Hey.
00:44:36.291,00:44:37.166,Mwah.
00:44:37.375,00:44:38.833,Here are the clothes you asked for.
00:44:39.000,00:44:39.875,Thank you.
00:44:40.291,00:44:41.750,Why did you need Grandpa's?
00:44:43.416,00:44:44.250,Oh.
00:44:45.375,00:44:48.208,"-Uh... Mom, this is Stuart. -Hi."
00:44:48.291,00:44:49.125,Hey.
00:44:49.625,00:44:51.208,Are you at school with Julie?
00:44:54.750,00:44:55.750,Are you kidding me?
00:44:56.583,00:44:57.958,You met him on a train?
00:44:58.041,00:44:59.416,-He could be a-- -He's not.
00:45:01.083,00:45:04.875,"I... would just like to say, you know, I'm-- I'm pretty responsible."
00:45:04.958,00:45:07.458,"You know, you look like that singer."
00:45:08.208,00:45:10.750,"He smiles like he's holding in a fart, you know?"
00:45:13.541,00:45:14.375,Mom!
00:45:19.833,00:45:21.000,"Oh, my God."
00:45:22.625,00:45:23.625,"Oh, God."
00:45:25.875,00:45:27.416,I'll let my publicist know that one.
00:45:27.958,00:45:30.333,"It's not all the time, you know?"
00:45:30.500,00:45:32.666,Only from certain angles.
00:45:32.791,00:45:34.583,"Okay, Stuart, here's some new clothes."
00:45:35.000,00:45:36.250,"Mom, you should sit."
00:45:36.583,00:45:37.875,I'm gonna go change.
00:45:56.958,00:45:57.916,"Hey, what's up?"
00:45:58.833,00:45:59.958,"Hey, babe... Um..."
00:46:00.500,00:46:02.041,I thought we were gonna meet up later.
00:46:02.125,00:46:02.958,Why?
00:46:03.750,00:46:06.000,Did you not want me to know you were here?
00:46:07.458,00:46:12.458,"No, I, you know, just thought-- What, you just happened not to mention that you were coming here?"
00:46:14.416,00:46:16.375,That's why you didn't answer any of my texts?
00:46:18.958,00:46:20.458,Are you rolling your eyes at me?
00:46:20.791,00:46:21.625,No.
00:46:24.833,00:46:25.791,What did you say?
00:46:26.541,00:46:27.833,I called you a psycho.
00:46:27.916,00:46:29.750,"Oh, she did not just call that girl a psycho."
00:46:34.083,00:46:34.916,Got it.
00:46:35.958,00:46:43.458,"'Cause as captain of the debate team, I know words are super important to you, so technically, if I were a psycho, I'd probably do this."
00:46:45.958,00:46:47.375,-Oh! -Did that just happen?
00:46:49.625,00:46:51.458,What is wrong with you?
00:46:52.208,00:46:53.041,Jeb?
00:46:53.625,00:46:56.125,No! I'm not going with you.
00:46:56.625,00:46:57.583,Excuse me?
00:46:57.666,00:47:00.333,I am just hanging out with my friends.
00:47:00.625,00:47:03.291,Okay? I don't have to see you every second of every day.
00:47:03.375,00:47:04.375,It's so...
00:47:04.750,00:47:05.625,annoying.
00:47:08.666,00:47:09.708,Seriously?
00:47:15.333,00:47:16.500,Are you okay?
00:47:17.500,00:47:19.875,"I mean, is he serious? I'm annoying?"
00:47:20.250,00:47:22.541,What the hell? And he's staying in there with her?
00:47:22.625,00:47:23.708,Seriously?
00:47:23.791,00:47:27.041,"Come on, that was a little over-the-top. You can't-- Over-the-top?"
00:47:27.333,00:47:29.666,-Whose side are you on? -I'm not on a side.
00:47:29.750,00:47:37.083,"I just... It's like you're so lost in your own drama, you don't even realize the things you say and do impact other people!"
00:47:37.750,00:47:39.791,Do you know the day I've had?
00:47:40.458,00:47:41.458,-And now Jeb-- -Stop it!
00:47:41.541,00:47:43.791,Stop pretending this whole thing is about Jeb!
00:47:44.500,00:47:45.666,What are you talking about?
00:47:45.750,00:47:50.500,I'm talking about your insane need for attention from people who don't seem to give a shit about you.
00:47:51.166,00:48:05.500,"If Jeb breaks up with you, you'll find someone else to chase after and freak out about and I'll still be here, same as always, waiting to do this all over again, just hoping you finally figure out how to stop caring about people that don't care about you!"
00:49:23.500,00:49:26.875,Then the wise men traveled across Westeros.
00:49:27.625,00:49:28.625,Welcome.
00:49:29.958,00:49:31.125,This is the best part.
00:49:31.458,00:49:36.666,"The wise men present the baby Jesus to the goddess Lakshmi, then everyone lights the menorah."
00:49:37.541,00:49:41.875,"This is one of the best, most insane things I think I've ever seen."
00:49:57.333,00:49:59.583,"Pops, this is uh... Stuart."
00:49:59.666,00:50:01.458,He's gonna be joining us for dinner.
00:50:02.041,00:50:03.583,Why is he wearing my clothes?
00:50:03.666,00:50:05.916,Uh... we went sledding and he got wet.
00:50:06.000,00:50:09.083,What kind of a person goes sledding in improper attire?
00:50:09.500,00:50:10.333,Uh...
00:50:11.333,00:50:12.625,"I do, sir."
00:50:15.583,00:50:20.083,So you're spending time with my granddaughter and you have bad ideas.
00:50:20.625,00:50:23.666,"Stuart, would... you want to help me in the kitchen?"
00:50:29.708,00:50:30.541,Julie...
00:50:31.041,00:50:32.166,he's not keeping the slacks.
00:51:30.458,00:51:32.750,"Hey, are you okay?"
00:51:33.166,00:51:38.958,"What the-- -Are you, like, stalking me? -No."
00:51:39.041,00:51:41.083,Don't you have somewhere else to be on Christmas Eve?
00:51:41.750,00:51:42.583,Don't you?
00:51:45.750,00:51:46.583,No.
00:51:50.625,00:51:51.708,Everyone hates me.
00:51:53.541,00:51:55.958,"My best friend, my boyfriend..."
00:51:56.250,00:51:59.041,Even my own mother doesn't want to spend Christmas with me.
00:52:00.000,00:52:01.416,Wow. That's...
00:52:02.625,00:52:04.458,"I'm sorry, that's painful."
00:52:07.125,00:52:08.833,And you go and lose my phone.
00:52:11.708,00:52:13.083,So-- So now...
00:52:13.708,00:52:15.458,you basically have nothing.
00:52:20.166,00:52:21.541,"Well, you know what?"
00:52:22.541,00:52:29.750,That is actually a really good time to look around and see what you really want.
00:52:31.166,00:52:36.000,"Like, if you could have anything for Christmas, what would it be?"
00:52:44.041,00:52:45.625,I want my best friend back.
00:52:47.375,00:52:48.208,Okay.
00:52:50.625,00:52:51.583,You want a ride?
00:52:54.375,00:52:56.916,-Will you explain the tin foil thing? -No. I'm not doing that.
00:52:57.375,00:52:58.333,It was worth a try.
00:53:05.833,00:53:07.750,There's a candy store in the woods.
00:53:07.833,00:53:08.666,So?
00:53:09.083,00:53:11.083,It flouts basic urban planning conventions.
00:53:12.208,00:53:13.791,-Hmm... -I'm with Pops.
00:53:15.458,00:53:16.500,It's weird.
00:53:16.791,00:53:19.375,"Hold on, I... personally love it."
00:53:19.750,00:53:21.625,-Hmm. -You know what you can call it?
00:53:21.958,00:53:24.416,If a Treat Falls in the Woods.
00:53:29.458,00:53:30.750,Am I missing something here?
00:53:32.625,00:53:34.250,-Uh... -I Googled you.
00:53:35.125,00:53:36.625,You grab your crotch a lot.
00:53:40.708,00:53:43.083,why is music today all about the crotch?
00:53:43.166,00:53:44.291,"Oh, come on, Dad."
00:53:45.041,00:53:46.333,You like Mick Jagger.
00:53:46.458,00:53:49.333,And he wore pants so tight you could see everything.
00:53:49.416,00:53:53.375,"No, I liked him for his blues influence, -not for his-- -Let's not say that out loud."
00:53:54.416,00:53:57.833,Exile on Main Street is the finest album ever made.
00:54:00.375,00:54:01.458,You just took a selfie.
00:54:04.333,00:54:06.500,but uh... I think you'll find...
00:54:07.125,00:54:08.291,it's Goats Head Soup.
00:54:13.041,00:54:14.375,-Hmm! -Yeah.
00:54:14.458,00:54:15.750,-Ha! Huh. -That's right.
00:54:15.833,00:54:17.000,"Now, Jagger..."
00:54:17.583,00:54:18.708,he could dance.
00:54:18.791,00:54:21.375,"Oh, Jagger was the master! Mm-hmm."
00:54:26.291,00:54:29.041,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. What's that supposed to be?"
00:54:29.166,00:54:30.250,"No, no, no, no."
00:54:32.416,00:54:34.041,"Oh, my God."
00:54:34.125,00:54:35.875,"Oh, is t-- Is this actually happening?"
00:54:47.875,00:54:48.833,"Mom, take it easy."
00:55:42.208,00:55:43.041,Mom?
00:55:43.125,00:55:44.000,I'm fine.
00:55:47.208,00:55:48.333,"Okay, there you go."
00:55:48.541,00:55:49.500,Just breathe.
00:56:03.250,00:56:04.083,Hey.
00:56:05.041,00:56:05.875,Hey.
00:56:13.833,00:56:14.708,Sorry about that.
00:56:16.291,00:56:17.125,With my mom.
00:56:18.333,00:56:20.666,You don't need to be sorry. I'm sorry if me...
00:56:22.125,00:56:24.000,being here made it worse.
00:56:24.625,00:56:26.708,"No, no, don't worry about that. You..."
00:56:26.958,00:56:28.541,You didn't. It's just...
00:56:29.625,00:56:31.541,"This is a cycle, you know."
00:56:32.916,00:56:36.125,"She says she's fine, she's not, and then I worry."
00:56:36.750,00:56:38.875,"Anyway, she's uh... she's doing better."
00:56:39.541,00:56:41.166,-She's laying down. -Okay.
00:56:41.708,00:56:45.375,But uh... you can understand why...
00:56:46.833,00:56:48.041,I need to stay.
00:56:50.833,00:56:51.666,I...
00:56:52.208,00:56:54.208,understand how that could be difficult.
00:56:56.458,00:56:57.333,Yeah.
00:57:05.083,00:57:06.458,I think you should let me help you.
00:57:09.416,00:57:10.458,What do you mean?
00:57:10.750,00:57:15.833,"I see how going off to college could be hard, you know, but..."
00:57:16.666,00:57:18.166,"I see other things too, Julie."
00:57:19.791,00:57:21.208,I see that you're smart.
00:57:22.625,00:57:23.666,I see...
00:57:24.250,00:57:26.500,that you're aching to get out of this town.
00:57:27.333,00:57:30.375,"So, I mean, I could get you a nurse to help with your mom."
00:57:32.791,00:57:33.666,Like...
00:57:34.291,00:57:35.125,what?
00:57:36.750,00:57:38.000,I'm a charity case?
00:57:39.541,00:57:41.916,"No. No, that's not what I said."
00:57:42.000,00:57:43.250,"No, but it's what you meant."
00:57:43.750,00:57:44.625,"No, it's not."
00:57:44.750,00:57:46.208,"I mean, you said it yourself."
00:57:46.666,00:57:50.500,"You're this famous, important guy with all your charities."
00:57:50.583,00:57:55.166,I was joking. That was a whole diff-- My town doesn't exist just for you to come and prance through it.
00:57:55.250,00:57:57.083,"-Prance? -Yeah, like it's some sort of..."
00:57:57.416,00:57:58.250,zoo or something.
00:57:58.333,00:58:00.541,I'm not prancing through a zoo.
00:58:00.625,00:58:04.541,"No, but you can just leave your tour bus and be a part of the real world, huh?"
00:58:06.250,00:58:09.458,I would appreciate you not taking my words out of context anymore.
00:58:09.541,00:58:11.166,"Okay, so what is this then?"
00:58:12.458,00:58:13.875,Today. All of this.
00:58:14.125,00:58:15.375,What are you doing here?
00:58:15.625,00:58:17.125,I was having fun.
00:58:17.333,00:58:18.166,Fun?
00:58:18.583,00:58:19.583,Less now.
00:58:28.041,00:58:32.416,"Look, I understand things are difficult."
00:58:32.500,00:58:33.333,Do you?
00:58:34.125,00:58:37.041,"I don't know if you do, Mr. Christmas in a Hotel."
00:58:37.333,00:58:39.875,I think that things come pretty easy for you.
00:58:39.958,00:58:42.041,I think you just let things roll right off your back.
00:58:42.125,00:58:42.958,"Well, they don't."
00:58:44.041,00:58:44.875,You know why?
00:58:47.500,00:58:52.958,"Because I'm a person, but people feel like they can say whatever they want to me."
00:58:53.958,00:58:55.875,"And I get it, I'm a fantasy or..."
00:58:56.958,00:58:59.291,"a joke, or whatever."
00:59:00.583,00:59:02.500,But I have feelings.
00:59:05.416,00:59:07.333,I haven't even felt happy in a while.
00:59:07.625,00:59:08.458,You know?
00:59:11.541,00:59:14.875,But I felt good this afternoon. I feel good being with you.
00:59:16.250,00:59:18.166,"I didn't question it, I just took it."
00:59:19.125,00:59:20.791,Life offered it and I took it.
00:59:21.833,00:59:24.458,Why do you think somebody's by themself on Christmas?
00:59:25.833,00:59:27.541,'Cause they're promoting an album.
00:59:27.916,00:59:30.250,Or because they don't have anywhere else to go.
00:59:31.083,00:59:34.000,Or... maybe they don't have a family to celebrate it with.
00:59:36.916,00:59:40.416,Maybe the staying in the hotel part is just the best option.
00:59:42.125,00:59:45.166,"I might have left my life for a couple hours, but not to..."
00:59:45.583,00:59:46.666,prance through a zoo.
00:59:50.875,00:59:53.333,But because I wanted to spend more time with you.
00:59:56.708,00:59:59.375,I really didn't mean for that to rhyme.
01:00:03.458,01:00:05.333,I didn't mean to say you prance.
01:00:13.916,01:00:14.750,Uh...
01:00:15.375,01:00:17.083,I-- I should go get that.
01:00:23.666,01:00:26.875,"Hi, I'm Kira. I work with Stuart."
01:00:27.875,01:00:31.041,"Oh, my God. Please, next time get lost somewhere with a Starbucks."
01:00:31.958,01:00:33.708,What the F are you wearing?
01:00:33.791,01:00:35.750,Please tell me nobody got a picture of him in that.
01:00:38.416,01:00:39.291,No.
01:00:40.333,01:00:41.791,Do you have any hand sani?
01:00:45.458,01:00:48.958,"Uh, hey, guys. Uh, just so you guys know, quick update on what's going on."
01:00:49.041,01:00:52.250,"I have alcohol on the way, so don't go anywhere."
01:00:52.333,01:00:55.666,"It'll be here in a few ticks, and we'll get this party really popping."
01:01:06.833,01:01:09.125,"I need some fuel, man! I need some party fuel!"
01:01:09.416,01:01:14.041,"Well, I would love to help you, Keon, but I am not allowed at the liquor store anymore."
01:01:14.125,01:01:15.541,The owner will not serve me.
01:01:15.625,01:01:18.291,I have tried using a disguise and he always knows it's me.
01:01:18.625,01:01:22.208,"Anyway, look, you have to let go of your expectations, man."
01:01:22.291,01:01:26.208,"Well, Tempest is gonna be here in an hour and this party sucks, so..."
01:01:26.291,01:01:27.791,"I don't think you're hearing me, Keon."
01:01:27.875,01:01:31.916,The universe will provide for you exactly what you need.
01:01:41.250,01:01:42.083,Oh.
01:01:46.458,01:01:47.291,Okay.
01:01:52.791,01:01:54.625,"Oh, God, I hate snow."
01:01:55.250,01:01:57.333,"I mean, what even is it? Nobody knows, you know?"
01:01:58.125,01:02:06.500,"Okay, listen, I'm gonna send you an NDA, which is like a promise to Stuart that you won't post anything, any pictures, any stories, anything about today."
01:02:06.875,01:02:08.500,I wouldn't do that to him.
01:02:09.750,01:02:10.625,We're friends.
01:02:10.708,01:02:13.250,"Oh, sweetie, no, no, no, no, no. Don't get attached."
01:02:13.583,01:02:15.208,He makes every girl fall in love with him.
01:02:15.291,01:02:19.583,"It happens all the time. That's why he's a star, right?"
01:02:20.125,01:02:21.416,It was just one day.
01:02:24.166,01:02:26.625,"Oh, thank God. You're hot again. Let's go."
01:02:30.625,01:02:31.625,Say your goodbyes.
01:02:37.000,01:02:39.000,"Look, she's, uh..."
01:02:39.916,01:02:43.083,"She's my publicist, so she can be kind of-- It's fine."
01:02:46.041,01:02:48.083,"Look, I meant everything I said up there."
01:02:49.416,01:02:50.333,Thank you. I...
01:02:52.541,01:02:53.625,I'm glad we met.
01:03:01.250,01:03:02.291,Come with me.
01:03:03.791,01:03:04.625,What?
01:03:05.583,01:03:06.458,Come with me.
01:03:08.416,01:03:10.958,"I hung out in your world, come hang out in mine."
01:03:11.916,01:03:12.833,I can't.
01:03:13.791,01:03:14.625,I...
01:03:15.291,01:03:16.125,How?
01:03:17.208,01:03:18.375,We can figure it out.
01:03:20.000,01:03:22.333,"No, this was-- This was just a day."
01:03:24.708,01:03:26.916,One day doesn't change anything for...
01:03:27.750,01:03:29.208,for either of us.
01:03:30.125,01:03:34.750,You... go back on your tour bus and I-- I stay in this town.
01:04:01.708,01:04:04.333,You should tell your mom that you got into Columbia.
01:04:38.791,01:04:40.125,You think you could wait for me?
01:04:40.208,01:04:45.708,"I don't know, hurry up. I just got a call from dispatch about a moron who got himself stuck in a snowbank."
01:05:06.000,01:05:07.083,"Hey, so..."
01:05:07.916,01:05:11.125,"I'm gonna go to this thing, this party."
01:05:11.833,01:05:13.625,JP's friend's party.
01:05:15.666,01:05:17.208,Cool. Cool.
01:05:19.083,01:05:20.916,I'm just waiting for the tow truck.
01:05:21.500,01:05:23.708,And then I should probably deliver this keg.
01:05:26.791,01:05:27.958,Have a great fun.
01:05:29.291,01:05:31.125,Have a great time. Have a great...
01:05:31.583,01:05:35.166,"Have a great time. I wanted to say have fun -and a great time-- -No, I got it."
01:05:35.875,01:05:36.833,I got it.
01:06:10.291,01:06:11.125,Hey.
01:06:14.875,01:06:15.791,"I'm fine, honey."
01:06:17.208,01:06:18.250,Are you?
01:06:22.416,01:06:23.250,Maybe I do.
01:06:24.333,01:06:25.750,Maybe more than I have been.
01:06:27.291,01:06:28.708,Sorry your friend had to go.
01:06:30.333,01:06:33.333,-He wasn't really my friend. So... -Right.
01:06:37.541,01:06:38.375,"Mom, I'm not..."
01:06:40.833,01:06:42.250,going to college.
01:06:45.250,01:06:46.458,What are you talking about?
01:06:46.916,01:06:49.708,Who's gonna take care of you? Pops?
01:06:50.291,01:06:51.541,-Yes. -Really?
01:06:51.833,01:06:53.500,And who's gonna take care of him?
01:06:53.875,01:06:55.125,We will take care of each other.
01:06:55.208,01:06:56.666,That's not how it works.
01:06:59.583,01:07:03.208,-It's okay if you're mad at me. -I'm mad that-- -I'm not mad at you. -You sound mad at me.
01:07:03.291,01:07:04.708,-I'm not mad. -It's okay if you are.
01:07:04.791,01:07:05.916,"Okay, I'm mad!"
01:07:08.166,01:07:11.500,"Look, I never-- I never want to feel it, I never want to say it, but I'm mad."
01:07:11.583,01:07:19.125,"I'm mad that you think that you're fine and then you're not and I'm mad that you think that this is just some perfect little elf village, but it's not, it's real life."
01:07:19.625,01:07:21.166,And I got into Columbia.
01:07:33.000,01:07:34.583,Why didn't you tell me?
01:07:35.958,01:07:37.041,Because I can't go.
01:07:40.041,01:07:42.083,Were you gonna check with me or just...
01:07:42.916,01:07:45.666,be in charge of the whole situation on your own?
01:07:47.416,01:07:48.375,The second one.
01:07:54.416,01:07:55.541,Listen to me.
01:07:59.208,01:08:00.416,Things happen in life.
01:08:02.000,01:08:02.958,Bad things.
01:08:04.583,01:08:07.083,"Sickness, divorce."
01:08:08.375,01:08:09.208,It's scary.
01:08:10.125,01:08:11.875,And it's survival to retreat.
01:08:12.541,01:08:16.750,"But if you retreat, you also miss the good things."
01:08:17.291,01:08:18.375,Do you understand?
01:08:19.541,01:08:25.333,"I know we don't talk about this stuff too much, but-- Mom, I can't leave you. What if-- Your life is to be lived."
01:08:27.875,01:08:31.083,Not put into a neat container to try and control.
01:08:32.875,01:08:34.166,It's not possible.
01:08:37.333,01:08:38.375,Trust me.
01:08:41.000,01:08:44.125,"And I'm sorry if I haven't been clear enough about this, but..."
01:08:44.958,01:08:46.166,I want to now.
01:08:48.083,01:08:51.333,When life offers you something special...
01:08:54.500,01:08:55.458,you take it.
01:09:02.833,01:09:03.708,Come here.
01:09:07.625,01:09:09.666,I wanted to get you that elf.
01:09:12.375,01:09:13.875,Just to make your Christmas.
01:09:18.416,01:09:22.333,"Oh, sweetie, you did make my Christmas."
01:09:28.791,01:09:33.041,"Okay, so the road is that white thing between the mailboxes."
01:09:33.125,01:09:34.791,If you hit a ditch or...
01:09:35.708,01:09:37.958,"a living room, you're doing it wrong."
01:09:38.541,01:09:39.375,Got that?
01:09:40.000,01:09:40.833,Got it.
01:09:42.125,01:09:43.000,So...
01:09:43.791,01:09:45.500,Merry Christmas!
01:09:47.208,01:09:49.041,Thank you. You too.
01:09:53.916,01:09:54.791,"Uh, hey..."
01:09:56.625,01:09:58.291,-Why do you wear the-- -No!
01:09:59.541,01:10:00.375,No.
01:10:09.375,01:10:10.416,Good job.
01:10:24.416,01:10:25.666,"Merry Christmas, D."
01:10:26.416,01:10:27.500,You got me the pig?
01:10:29.750,01:10:31.083,It's an apology pig.
01:10:32.333,01:10:33.666,"D, I'm so sorry."
01:10:35.000,01:10:36.208,I'm sorry too.
01:10:38.083,01:10:40.916,I shouldn't have said that thing about you needing attention.
01:10:41.208,01:10:42.958,Or I should have said it...
01:10:45.791,01:10:52.333,"I was frustrated and sad and, um... embarrassed about stuff."
01:10:55.958,01:11:01.458,"Dorrie, I'm gonna need you to look at me and listen to what I'm about to tell you, okay?"
01:11:03.166,01:11:09.000,"I don't know what's going on, but I do know this: You are 1000% flawless."
01:11:09.583,01:11:12.500,"Like, there is literally nothing wrong with you."
01:11:12.750,01:11:17.458,"You are an incredible friend, you make me laugh when I'm freaked out."
01:11:17.541,01:11:20.333,"Even when I'm being a complete dick, you're still there for me."
01:11:20.416,01:11:23.833,"You are the coolest, most badass human being on this planet."
01:11:23.916,01:11:30.875,"Okay? If you and Beyoncé were trapped in a house that was on fire and I could only save one of you, I would let Beyoncé die."
01:11:33.791,01:11:41.416,"And if somebody doesn't see that, that's not your problem because you deserve to be with someone who wants to shout from the rooftops how great you are!"
01:12:16.125,01:12:20.333,"Hey, Chad, you know, I swear I've seen that keg before."
01:12:21.500,01:12:24.833,"And you know, I know I've seen that kid before."
01:12:25.500,01:12:28.208,"On his ass, on the ice."
01:12:31.375,01:12:32.416,So?
01:12:33.000,01:12:33.833,So?
01:12:35.166,01:12:36.250,So I stole your keg.
01:12:38.250,01:12:39.958,"Come on, man. Bring it on."
01:12:41.166,01:12:42.541,Try me. Huh?
01:12:42.916,01:12:46.125,You don't know my story. You don't know where I'm from. You don't know me.
01:12:46.375,01:12:47.708,"Yeah, I went to piano camp."
01:12:48.541,01:12:49.375,So?
01:12:50.250,01:12:52.833,"You know, I used to have a peanut sensitivity, but I beat it."
01:12:52.916,01:12:54.666,Do you know how hard that is?
01:12:55.083,01:12:56.000,Do you?
01:12:57.000,01:13:00.500,"Fear of raccoons? No. Couple of months of therapy, and done!"
01:13:07.083,01:13:08.125,This guy...
01:13:12.208,01:13:14.208,That's what I'm talking about!
01:13:14.416,01:13:21.041,"Wearing a weird-ass costume, yelling about raccoons and shit, fucking nipple bleeding?"
01:13:24.000,01:13:25.875,"Let's turn this party up a notch, huh?"
01:13:32.375,01:13:33.375,So who's thirsty?
01:13:42.250,01:13:48.041,"Look, I don't know what's going on with you, but I'm not doing this hot and cold thing."
01:13:49.125,01:13:50.125,I liked you.
01:13:51.125,01:13:54.750,"And when we hung out, I felt like we really got each other."
01:13:55.208,01:14:00.458,"I kind of thought you felt the same way and that's rare, you know, but..."
01:14:01.708,01:14:03.708,"it's bullshit, how you've treated me today."
01:14:04.541,01:14:07.083,"Whatever your problem is, it's got nothing to do with me."
01:14:09.291,01:14:11.791,Don't throw up. Own this moment. Don't throw up.
01:14:14.791,01:14:17.875,"But then the other half of me is like, Kylie Jenner didn't go to college."
01:14:17.958,01:14:21.250,I can live at home and save money and focus on my songwriting.
01:14:22.958,01:14:25.166,"Yeah, I think you should listen to that half of you."
01:14:25.458,01:14:27.333,It's um... a solid plan.
01:14:30.000,01:14:31.000,Would you excuse me?
01:14:34.625,01:14:35.958,"Oh, my God."
01:14:36.833,01:14:38.375,How long was I talking for?
01:14:39.000,01:14:40.750,I'm gonna go get a couple of drinks.
01:14:40.833,01:14:42.541,-I have one. -They're both for me.
01:15:00.833,01:15:03.625,"Hey, yo, it's popping off at the Waffle Town."
01:15:03.708,01:15:05.708,Get your asses down here now.
01:15:24.375,01:15:25.208,Hey.
01:15:41.583,01:15:43.000,"Angie, I'm in love with you."
01:15:45.500,01:15:48.750,"And it's not, like, you know, in a traditional sense or anything. It's..."
01:15:50.500,01:15:53.291,"It's more like, I think of you every moment of the day."
01:15:54.208,01:15:56.541,And I just want you to think I'm cool all the time.
01:15:58.500,01:16:02.125,"You know, when something funny happens, you're the only person I want to tell."
01:16:02.666,01:16:07.583,"When something sad happens, I just want to know if you think it's sad."
01:16:10.250,01:16:11.958,"And when I saw you with JP, I..."
01:16:12.166,01:16:13.416,I wanted to kill him.
01:16:20.041,01:16:22.583,"I want to be with you for the rest of my life, Angie."
01:16:27.291,01:16:28.125,Wow.
01:16:32.208,01:16:34.125,That was actually pretty traditional.
01:16:34.791,01:16:38.000,"It was-- It was pretty tradi-- You know, as soon as I said it, I..."
01:16:38.791,01:16:39.625,Yeah.
01:16:41.750,01:16:43.666,Now I want to tell you something.
01:16:48.291,01:16:50.166,I freaked out about it being you...
01:16:51.791,01:16:52.625,for me.
01:16:56.875,01:16:58.083,But it is you.
01:17:00.708,01:17:02.291,It's always been you.
01:17:26.750,01:17:28.125,Can I ask you a question?
01:17:30.250,01:17:32.041,Can we still hang out with JP?
01:17:32.125,01:17:33.375,I like that guy.
01:17:33.916,01:17:34.750,Yeah.
01:17:36.750,01:17:38.041,Can I ask you a question?
01:17:38.333,01:17:39.166,Yeah.
01:17:40.958,01:17:42.875,What the hell are you wearing?
01:17:45.541,01:17:46.708,I'm a wise man.
01:18:15.166,01:18:19.625,"Whoa. We got sharps on the ground! Nobody sit down! All right, here we go."
01:18:19.708,01:18:22.583,"Julie, could you actually save my life and get a mop from the closet?"
01:18:22.666,01:18:25.125,"-It's by the office. -Uh... Yeah, sure, okay."
01:18:34.166,01:18:35.166,No way.
01:18:38.750,01:18:39.791,"Aw, that's nice."
01:18:39.958,01:18:41.625,"Oh, hi, guys!"
01:18:44.916,01:18:49.250,"Uh, so do you guys mind if we borrow some of that electricity for these, uh, colorful bulbs?"
01:19:26.458,01:19:27.291,Hey.
01:19:29.291,01:19:30.125,Hey.
01:19:30.541,01:19:33.583,"Sorry to interrupt, but um... can I talk to you for a second?"
01:19:43.458,01:19:44.291,"Dorrie, I'm..."
01:19:45.250,01:19:46.583,I'm really sorry.
01:19:48.791,01:19:49.625,You were right.
01:19:51.041,01:19:54.208,"When we hung out, that was the best night of my life."
01:19:56.083,01:19:57.916,But... I lied to you.
01:19:59.958,01:20:00.875,I'm not out.
01:20:03.166,01:20:04.000,"Wait, what?"
01:20:05.041,01:20:05.875,You...
01:20:06.458,01:20:09.041,You had that whole story about your mom...
01:20:09.125,01:20:13.875,"Yeah, because you told me your story, and it's so exactly how I want mine to go."
01:20:15.041,01:20:16.000,I want to be like you.
01:20:16.750,01:20:17.583,You're just...
01:20:17.916,01:20:21.708,You're out and you're so sure of yourself and you're open and you're like...
01:20:24.708,01:20:27.708,I'm not intimidatingly cool.
01:20:28.500,01:20:30.500,"You know, when I saw you today, I was..."
01:20:30.875,01:20:32.041,so excited.
01:20:33.125,01:20:34.916,But also crazy scared 'cause...
01:20:35.958,01:20:38.250,"my friends don't know, so, um..."
01:20:38.333,01:20:40.916,"-I handled it, like-- -Really badly?"
01:20:47.125,01:20:48.750,But you inspired me.
01:20:49.875,01:20:51.708,"I mean, just like that night, you..."
01:20:52.541,01:20:58.708,"you make me feel brave and you make me feel like I want to be the best possible version of myself, so..."
01:21:27.125,01:21:28.666,What's up? What happened?
01:21:29.875,01:21:31.958,Tempest isn't actually coming anymore.
01:21:34.000,01:21:35.500,"Oh, okay."
01:21:44.208,01:21:47.500,"You know, I'm okay with it."
01:22:18.416,01:22:19.416,Have you seen a pig?
01:22:20.333,01:22:21.541,Look out for the pig!
01:22:21.916,01:22:23.083,Have you seen a pig?
01:22:23.375,01:22:25.333,What? Like ever?
01:22:25.791,01:22:26.625,Forget it.
01:22:30.000,01:22:30.958,That's my pig!
01:22:32.958,01:22:33.791,Cool.
01:22:36.333,01:22:39.291,"-This was a crazy day. -Oh, my God, tell me about it."
01:22:40.541,01:22:56.083,"At the beginning of today, I actually hated this song, What are you doing here?"
01:22:56.833,01:22:57.750,"I, uh..."
01:22:58.791,01:23:00.458,never got to try that waffle.
01:23:02.500,01:23:03.333,"I, um..."
01:23:03.875,01:23:08.083,"I was actually thinking about you, and um... what I said earlier."
01:23:10.166,01:23:12.583,Turns out one day actually can make a difference.
01:23:38.375,01:23:39.583,Holy shit!
01:23:40.000,01:23:41.625,Stuart Bale is at my party?
01:23:42.458,01:23:44.041,"Oh, yeah, yeah, he was here earlier."
01:23:44.541,01:23:45.375,What?
01:23:45.625,01:23:48.708,"So, any plans to be in New York?"
01:23:48.791,01:23:50.041,When does Columbia start?
01:24:38.458,01:24:42.583,Snow can make a difference. Especially on Christmas Eve.
01:24:42.666,01:24:51.333,"And sometimes it's not just the eve of Christmas, it's the eve of everything, of the rest of your life."
01:25:02.125,01:25:09.875,"or stuck in a snowbank, or makes you fall on your ass, sometimes, you just gotta let it snow."
01:32:24.208,01:32:27.125,That is such a good song!
