00:01:10.111,00:01:12.364,We have visual on a possible high-value target.
00:01:13.407,00:01:20.706,"Thor, this is Valhalla. We're seeking positive ID on target traveling in convoy and we're pushing more assets your way."
00:01:21.999,00:01:24.376,Contact Loki on secondary net.
00:01:25.252,00:01:27.128,"Loki, this is Thor."
00:01:27.337,00:01:35.012,Target is located at grid coordinates two-four-Tango-Kilo-Bravo one-two-four-five-six- seven-three-niner.
00:01:35.094,00:01:36.346,Confirm you have visual.
00:01:40.308,00:01:41.351,Confirming target.
00:02:05.125,00:02:06.209,Stand by for audio.
00:02:09.504,00:02:13.425,"Now, don't tell me you spotted the beard in the middle of a goddamn sandstorm."
00:02:13.508,00:02:14.593,Is it really him?
00:02:14.885,00:02:16.720,"We're confirming that now, sir."
00:02:16.804,00:02:19.139,"Sir, audio is coming up now. Verifying voice pattern match."
00:02:19.222,00:02:20.390,"What do we have here, Sergeant?"
00:02:22.101,00:02:27.439,"Four males. One of them is speaking in a Rakhshani dialect, consistent with our intel on Al-Khoei."
00:02:32.694,00:02:36.239,Thirty-seven percent and probable don't belong in the same sentence.
00:02:36.323,00:02:38.117,I'm not taking this to the President.
00:02:41.161,00:02:42.871,based on reliable intel from the Brits.
00:02:42.955,00:02:43.956,They're pulling off the highway.
00:03:04.852,00:03:08.730,"If it's him, this guy comes out of hiding every couple of years at best."
00:03:18.323,00:03:20.199,"This is a training camp, Mr. Secretary."
00:03:23.662,00:03:24.705,Abort rec still holds.
00:03:27.082,00:03:28.625,"What do you suggest we do, sir?"
00:03:31.003,00:03:32.420,Is that a weapons cache?
00:03:32.504,00:03:36.257,"Sir, the placement of the stones around the pit, marker for the five pillars of Islam."
00:03:36.466,00:03:37.592,I think it's a funeral.
00:03:38.010,00:03:39.136,For Christ's sake.
00:03:39.720,00:03:42.931,"Counsel, how many ways would this violate the Geneva Convention?"
00:03:43.849,00:03:45.017,We can invoke hors de combat.
00:03:47.519,00:03:48.937,"that this is, in fact, a funeral."
00:03:49.021,00:03:52.107,"Signal's got the President from Air Force One, sir."
00:04:00.657,00:04:05.787,"Mr. President, we have a 51% identity match on Majid al-Khoei."
00:04:05.871,00:04:09.541,"The bad news is, there's some possibility he's at a funeral."
00:04:09.624,00:04:12.502,You should also be aware we have an abort recommendation.
00:04:13.461,00:04:15.672,But the Joint Chiefs are urging a go.
00:04:24.806,00:04:30.104,"Sir, we measure success by the least amount of collateral damage."
00:04:30.187,00:04:34.524,"At 51% probability, the risk is too high."
00:04:38.028,00:04:39.947,I'm putting our people at risk.
00:04:41.364,00:04:42.866,You have a go.
00:04:46.327,00:04:48.038,"Thank you, Mr. President."
00:04:54.962,00:04:56.296,"Loki, you are cleared to engage."
00:05:00.675,00:05:02.094,"Loki, target coordinates received."
00:05:02.177,00:05:04.054,"Yes, sir. Switching to IR sensor."
00:05:16.942,00:05:18.152,Master arm on.
00:05:18.652,00:05:19.653,Missiles away.
00:05:48.682,00:05:50.184,"You got to make a choice, fellas."
00:05:51.601,00:05:55.772,Who are you going to be? Boys or men?
00:05:59.358,00:06:00.319,I'm out on this one.
00:06:00.401,00:06:01.236,Why?
00:06:01.320,00:06:02.237,'Cause I'm broke.
00:06:02.403,00:06:03.488,Come...
00:06:03.571,00:06:05.157,How do I know you don't have something great under there?
00:06:05.240,00:06:06.074,Kwame just paired the board.
00:06:06.158,00:06:07.701,I'm floating on the river here. Look at the table.
00:06:07.784,00:06:09.870,I don't know. I'm supposed to take my girl out later.
00:06:09.953,00:06:10.829,It's a lot of money.
00:06:10.912,00:06:13.165,Your girl out? Who's that?
00:06:14.166,00:06:15.292,-Elaine? -Yeah.
00:06:15.750,00:06:17.336,You guys have been going out for a while.
00:06:17.961,00:06:19.296,How long?
00:06:19.504,00:06:20.421,Couple months.
00:06:20.505,00:06:21.715,Couple months? Wow.
00:06:21.798,00:06:23.133,That's big. You have sex with her yet?
00:06:24.092,00:06:25.135,Kinda.
00:06:27.888,00:06:29.639,Let me ask you a question. What are you going to do tonight?
00:06:30.140,00:06:31.058,Fish fillet and a Coke?
00:06:31.141,00:06:34.644,"Go to Blockbuster, rent a little romantic comedy, go back to Mom's house, sit on the couch?"
00:06:34.728,00:06:35.979,"-How'd you know? -Well, that's what you do."
00:06:36.063,00:06:37.772,You're a dependable person. That's what you're going to do.
00:06:37.856,00:06:39.233,-You know what you should do? -Hmm?
00:06:39.691,00:06:41.985,You need to lay down some real green and treat your lady right.
00:06:42.069,00:06:43.987,"You know, you need to take her to a nice place."
00:06:44.071,00:06:47.115,Red Lobster. Olive Garden. Tablecloths. Soft music.
00:06:47.241,00:06:48.742,And then you skip this Blockbuster thing.
00:06:49.368,00:06:50.244,Girls want to go out.
00:06:50.327,00:06:51.953,"Especially a girl as cute as your girl, you know?"
00:06:52.329,00:06:54.331,She wants to be seen. That's why she dresses up.
00:06:54.581,00:06:55.999,So you take her to the movies.
00:06:56.083,00:06:57.751,-A little popcorn-drink combo. -True. True.
00:06:57.834,00:07:00.921,"Elaine might want a hot dog and some nachos, so you shell out for that, too."
00:07:01.004,00:07:04.758,"And then before you know it, she's cozying up the way she never would've at her mom's house, you know?"
00:07:04.841,00:07:06.301,"-Preach it. Preach it. -Now all of a sudden, look."
00:07:06.509,00:07:10.430,"Gino Romero's walking tall with Elaine yank-my-Dickinson, all because he dared to dream tonight."
00:07:10.513,00:07:11.681,-Yes! Yes! Yes! -And he became a man.
00:07:11.765,00:07:12.599,-And that's the choice. -Yes.
00:07:12.682,00:07:15.018,And that's what's on the table. This is the dream right here.
00:07:16.353,00:07:17.478,Are you a man?
00:07:17.854,00:07:19.231,"-I'm with you. -Okay, here we go."
00:07:19.314,00:07:20.523,-I'm with you. 20? -20.
00:07:20.607,00:07:21.566,Big boy game.
00:07:24.152,00:07:25.112,"Cowboys over aces, big Jer."
00:07:26.196,00:07:27.072,Wow. Wow.
00:07:27.155,00:07:28.031,"-Didn't see that coming, huh? -Yeah, that's a tough one."
00:07:28.115,00:07:30.367,"This is a tough one, too. Four bullets, baby."
00:07:30.450,00:07:31.368,Get out of here!
00:07:31.451,00:07:33.328,"You baited me into that, Jer. Come on!"
00:07:33.412,00:07:34.246,That's the way it goes.
00:07:34.329,00:07:35.205,So what happened to Red Lobster?
00:07:35.289,00:07:36.831,"No, I guess it's Mama's house for you tonight."
00:07:36.915,00:07:38.166,"But look, I saved you 40 bucks."
00:07:38.250,00:07:40.419,And now Elaine won't have to shell out for herpes medication.
00:07:41.753,00:07:42.879,"Break's over, bitches."
00:07:43.130,00:07:44.256,Freitag missed his shift again.
00:07:45.548,00:07:49.344,"All right, well, gentlemen, I'll give you a chance to win some of this back tomorrow."
00:07:49.428,00:07:50.470,Enjoy yourselves.
00:07:57.144,00:08:00.272,Hey there. Welcome to Copy Cabana. How can I help you?
00:08:00.355,00:08:02.232,I couldn't get the machine past the main menu.
00:08:02.316,00:08:03.858,-That machine there? -Yeah.
00:08:03.942,00:08:05.944,"Did you swipe your credit card to the left, sir?"
00:08:06.027,00:08:07.779,"-Didn't do that. -Well, that's your problem."
00:08:07.862,00:08:09.072,Why don't you try it again?
00:08:19.499,00:08:21.335,"Cell phone users, beware."
00:08:21.418,00:08:27.924,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation can now hear everything you're saying, even when your cell phone is turned off."
00:08:28.008,00:08:34.681,"Authorities can now activate the microphone inside your phone, allowing them to eavesdrop on you and your conversations."
00:08:34.764,00:08:39.727,Experts say the only way around this is to take the battery out of the device.
00:08:43.482,00:08:44.441,-Stand clear of the doors. -Excuse me.
00:08:44.524,00:08:45.775,"Watch your step, please."
00:08:52.073,00:08:53.033,Yes.
00:08:53.950,00:08:55.369,"It's hard to do on a train, you know!"
00:08:57.371,00:08:58.579,Standing passengers...
00:09:00.665,00:09:02.167,"Come on, come on, come on, come on."
00:09:45.710,00:09:47.295,Jerry?
00:09:47.379,00:09:49.464,Mrs. Wierzbowski! I was just...
00:09:49.548,00:09:50.882,I thought you might have been sleeping.
00:09:50.965,00:09:52.342,"-Yeah, yeah, yeah. -So... But I have..."
00:09:52.426,00:09:54.553,I have some rent here. Here you go.
00:09:54.635,00:09:56.596,"Yeah, some is good. All is better."
00:09:56.679,00:09:58.515,"Well, that's most of it. Here."
00:09:58.598,00:09:59.974,"$1, $1, $1..."
00:10:00.058,00:10:01.642,"No, no, no. Look. Here's a five there."
00:10:01.726,00:10:02.936,-Five. -Yeah.
00:10:03.978,00:10:05.939,Where is girl? I don't see her no more.
00:10:06.022,00:10:07.941,You know you're the only woman for me.
00:10:08.024,00:10:09.568,"No, that's done. She got smart."
00:10:10.693,00:10:11.570,Like the others.
00:10:11.652,00:10:12.862,Yeah. Yeah.
00:10:12.946,00:10:14.948,Is woman friend? Answer.
00:10:15.115,00:10:17.242,Then see if she give you money for rent.
00:10:18.368,00:10:19.494,One second.
00:10:21.996,00:10:22.914,"Hey, Mom."
00:10:26.042,00:10:27.085,What?
00:10:55.363,00:10:56.739,I'm not him.
00:12:36.839,00:12:39.092,"Six months without a boo or a bah, huh?"
00:12:39.800,00:12:40.927,"Yes, sir."
00:12:41.386,00:12:43.304,So where were you this time?
00:12:44.931,00:12:49.310,Alaska. Singapore. I got a job there.
00:12:52.522,00:12:55.774,I... I spoke to Stanford.
00:12:56.901,00:12:58.986,I pulled some strings. They said they'd take you back.
00:12:59.070,00:13:00.863,"-Even though you took off... -Two years ago, Dad."
00:13:00.947,00:13:04.284,"Jerry, you know, it wouldn't kill you to ask for help once in a while."
00:13:04.825,00:13:05.993,You want to have this conversation now?
00:13:06.077,00:13:07.621,-It's Stanford! -You want to do this today.
00:13:07.704,00:13:08.580,You know how many people would kill...
00:13:08.663,00:13:09.581,Today? You want to have this now?
00:13:09.664,00:13:10.624,Fine.
00:13:10.707,00:13:12.041,You do whatever you want.
00:13:12.751,00:13:13.627,You always have.
00:13:20.967,00:13:29.183,"You know, I keep thinking, I'm going to walk in here one day and I'm not going to feel like a stranger in my own house."
00:13:40.654,00:13:41.780,I don't want your money.
00:14:12.811,00:14:15.730,Smoking is not permitted on the train.
00:14:15.814,00:14:17.357,Chicago is next.
00:14:36.835,00:14:39.462,Can't find the keys and he's late as usual.
00:14:39.920,00:14:41.172,I'm going to have to take you.
00:14:41.255,00:14:42.215,He'll be here.
00:14:43.966,00:14:45.593,"All right, wait five more minutes."
00:14:46.052,00:14:48.221,Help me out here. We came home last night.
00:14:48.304,00:14:50.557,I put the leftovers down. You turned on the TV.
00:14:50.640,00:14:54.394,"I went over, said, No TV, no TV, no TV. Turned it off."
00:14:54.811,00:14:57.104,Came over here. Checked the messages.
00:14:57.188,00:14:58.690,Knocked over the phone.
00:14:58.773,00:14:59.899,"Right, knocked over the phone. Put it back."
00:15:00.608,00:15:02.318,Put the leftovers in the fridge.
00:15:07.073,00:15:07.948,Let's go!
00:15:08.074,00:15:09.283,I put vitamins in your toiletry bag.
00:15:09.367,00:15:10.243,Don't forget to take...
00:15:10.326,00:15:11.202,Two in the morning and two at night.
00:15:11.285,00:15:12.119,That's right.
00:15:12.203,00:15:13.079,And your inhaler's in the back of your bag.
00:15:14.288,00:15:15.122,Come here.
00:15:15.206,00:15:16.875,"You didn't think I'd miss the big send-off, do you, huh?"
00:15:16.957,00:15:18.167,Let's get you on this train.
00:15:18.251,00:15:20.169,-This must be your... -Trumpet.
00:15:20.253,00:15:21.212,"My God, this weighs, like, 200 pounds."
00:15:21.295,00:15:22.338,You carry this yourself?
00:15:22.422,00:15:23.840,-Mr. and Mrs. Holloman! -Miss.
00:15:23.923,00:15:25.675,-You just made it. -Right.
00:15:25.759,00:15:27.134,"-Here, Sam. -Thanks."
00:15:28.344,00:15:30.012,"All these other kids, right?"
00:15:30.096,00:15:31.097,"They're going to call their moms, too, all right?"
00:15:31.180,00:15:32.849,They're just going to lie about it.
00:15:32.932,00:15:35.435,"All right, and eat junk food 'cause this is your one chance, but brush your teeth."
00:15:35.518,00:15:37.270,"Mom, you got to stop."
00:15:38.229,00:15:39.606,"I'm going to miss you, too."
00:15:40.690,00:15:41.691,is departing now.
00:15:41.775,00:15:42.650,Give me a hug.
00:15:43.651,00:15:45.319,"-I love you so much. -I love you, too."
00:15:46.987,00:15:48.782,"-Shine bright, okay? -Okay."
00:15:50.032,00:15:51.868,"Rock the house, buddy. You're going to be great. Okay?"
00:15:51.951,00:15:53.411,-Okay. -I'll see you later.
00:15:53.494,00:15:54.370,Bye!
00:15:54.454,00:15:56.080,Have fun in DC!
00:15:57.123,00:15:58.625,Your mom going to be okay?
00:15:58.999,00:16:00.000,It's unclear.
00:16:01.461,00:16:02.921,"I'm so sorry. I got stuck in traffic, and I didn't even..."
00:16:03.003,00:16:04.046,Don't even say it.
00:16:17.143,00:16:18.603,It's here. It's here.
00:16:21.439,00:16:22.398,"Okay, okay."
00:16:39.874,00:16:41.083,Two seconds. Sorry.
00:16:48.675,00:16:50.009,"No, wait."
00:16:59.059,00:17:00.144,"-Hey, hang on a second. -Sorry."
00:17:02.146,00:17:03.982,"Big date, you know? Fingers crossed, huh?"
00:17:08.027,00:17:09.445,-Here you go. -Thank you.
00:17:09.529,00:17:10.488,Have a good day!
00:17:12.323,00:17:13.992,"-Oh, Jerry! -What?"
00:17:14.450,00:17:16.452,-So many boxes. -Boxes?
00:17:16.536,00:17:18.830,I had to open your room. All day they come.
00:17:18.913,00:17:20.748,"-Big boxes, small boxes. -My boxes?"
00:17:20.832,00:17:22.208,I don't know. Whose boxes would they be?
00:17:22.291,00:17:23.209,"All right, okay."
00:17:23.292,00:17:24.711,Look at them there. See in there?
00:17:24.794,00:17:26.086,"-See, I put them all... -Yeah. Yeah."
00:17:26.170,00:17:27.005,"Listen, I have something for you here."
00:17:27.087,00:17:28.006,Yeah.
00:17:28.088,00:17:30.132,"This is rent for this month and next month, too, okay?"
00:17:30.216,00:17:31.133,"-Oh, my. -Thank you."
00:18:45.458,00:18:46.459,Hello?
00:18:49.462,00:18:50.964,You must flee the premises.
00:18:51.047,00:18:52.214,Who... Who is this?
00:18:52.298,00:18:53.758,"You've been activated, Jerry."
00:18:53.841,00:18:55.760,-Who the hell is this? -Your compliance is vital.
00:18:55.843,00:18:56.844,How did you get this number?
00:18:56.928,00:18:58.721,You now have 24 seconds.
00:18:58.805,00:18:59.722,Leave your residence.
00:18:59.806,00:19:02.141,"Your destination, the Mathis train station."
00:19:02.224,00:19:03.559,We will guide you from there.
00:19:03.643,00:19:04.518,What is this?
00:19:04.602,00:19:06.395,The evidence in your apartment is irrefutable.
00:19:07.021,00:19:07.981,-Listen. -17 seconds.
00:19:08.064,00:19:09.273,I'm going to hang this phone up now.
00:19:09.356,00:19:10.650,"They'll seek your arrest for conspiracy, treason..."
00:19:10.733,00:19:11.567,I'm hanging this phone up now!
00:19:11.651,00:19:12.735,...violating state and local law.
00:19:12.819,00:19:14.070,You tell me how you got this number!
00:19:14.153,00:19:15.029,"Maximum penalty, death."
00:19:15.113,00:19:16.072,"No, none of this is mine!"
00:19:22.120,00:19:22.996,Get on the ground!
00:19:26.749,00:19:27.875,I didn't do anything!
00:19:30.377,00:19:32.797,It's not mine! It's not mine!
00:19:44.058,00:19:45.935,"This is obviously some sort of mistake, right?"
00:19:46.310,00:19:47.895,"I mean, I don't know what I'm doing in this room, sir."
00:19:49.271,00:19:51.482,It's cold as hell outside.
00:19:53.026,00:19:54.110,You draw?
00:19:54.986,00:19:55.862,I what?
00:19:55.945,00:19:57.071,Do you draw? Do you sketch?
00:19:57.155,00:19:58.656,You have ink all over your fingers.
00:20:01.742,00:20:03.202,"Look, you know you got the wrong guy, right?"
00:20:03.285,00:20:04.745,"I mean, this is all some kind of sick joke."
00:20:04.829,00:20:05.788,I don't know what I'm doing here.
00:20:05.872,00:20:06.831,Obviously.
00:20:07.040,00:20:08.666,"Obviously you have nothing to do with it, yeah."
00:20:10.877,00:20:11.961,Did you love your brother?
00:20:14.172,00:20:16.298,Or did you hate him? Did you admire him?
00:20:18.759,00:20:21.095,"Was your brother patriotic, would you say?"
00:20:24.640,00:20:26.059,When's the last time you saw him?
00:20:28.686,00:20:29.562,Christmas.
00:20:29.645,00:20:30.813,This past Christmas?
00:20:32.481,00:20:33.816,Three Christmases ago.
00:20:33.900,00:20:35.026,"Three years, huh?"
00:20:35.818,00:20:39.238,"Well, the phone records show that you haven't even called him in over a year."
00:20:39.321,00:20:42.324,So no text messages? No smoke signals?
00:20:42.408,00:20:43.784,No MySpace or Facebook messages?
00:20:43.868,00:20:45.285,"Yeah, so what are you trying to say? We're not..."
00:20:45.369,00:20:49.916,"Are you asking if we're the type of twins that wear the same shirt to the mall, hold hands, and things like that? No."
00:20:51.667,00:20:52.752,"Sir, I don't even know your name."
00:20:52.835,00:20:54.045,"I'm sorry, that was rude of me."
00:20:54.461,00:20:58.966,"I'm Tom Morgan, the Supervising Agent assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force."
00:20:59.383,00:21:00.300,Ter...
00:21:02.136,00:21:03.303,You think I'm a terrorist?
00:21:04.597,00:21:06.265,"No, you're a copy boy, aren't you?"
00:21:06.348,00:21:07.516,I'm a copy associate.
00:21:07.600,00:21:08.642,Copy associate.
00:21:11.229,00:21:14.857,"it says here he was a little more, I guess you'd say, ambitious than you."
00:21:15.482,00:21:21.114,"Graduated from the Air Force Academy at 21, with an advanced degree in parallel algorithms and quantum electronics."
00:21:21.197,00:21:23.282,I don't even know what the hell that stuff means. Do you?
00:21:23.741,00:21:26.493,"Cadet wing commander, valedictorian, plum job in the Public Affairs..."
00:21:26.577,00:21:27.578,"Yeah, no, I know what he did, sir."
00:21:28.079,00:21:29.496,"Why'd you drop out of school, Jerry?"
00:21:29.705,00:21:31.540,Did your brother have any influence on that decision?
00:21:32.083,00:21:33.459,"No, school just wasn't for me."
00:21:33.542,00:21:36.087,"No, I mean, who would want a Stanford education anyway?"
00:21:36.170,00:21:38.714,"More upward mobility at Copy Cabana, I guess, right?"
00:21:39.048,00:21:40.883,I see you did a little backpacking.
00:21:40.967,00:21:43.343,"Singapore, Bali, Indonesia."
00:21:43.427,00:21:44.762,Did odd jobs here and there. So you've been around.
00:21:44.845,00:21:47.723,"Look, none of this has anything to do with any of the shit that was in my apartment."
00:21:48.182,00:21:50.017,Why would I send it to myself? My name is on the lease.
00:21:50.434,00:21:52.603,I'd have to be the dumbest terrorist in the history of the world.
00:21:52.686,00:21:54.063,So who deposited the 750?
00:21:54.147,00:21:56.107,The... I don't know who deposited the 750!
00:21:57.483,00:21:59.902,"God maybe? I thought it was a miracle, I took the money."
00:21:59.986,00:22:01.154,That was my mistake. It was an accident.
00:22:01.237,00:22:03.030,Do accidents not happen in your universe?
00:22:03.114,00:22:07.076,"Well, the money originated from the YTBC Bank of..."
00:22:07.160,00:22:08.535,"Well, I'll be darned, Singapore."
00:22:09.203,00:22:13.082,"Opened with a transfer from a corporation called The Star of Orion, a dummy front for Hezbollah."
00:22:13.166,00:22:14.250,"This is all very interesting, sir."
00:22:14.333,00:22:15.209,It has nothing to do with me.
00:22:15.293,00:22:17.170,We find hardware in your apartment.
00:22:17.628,00:22:19.213,Latest military spec.
00:22:19.588,00:22:20.798,-Airplane manuals. -I told you about this already.
00:22:20.881,00:22:23.801,"And 1,200 pounds of ammonium nitrate fertilizer."
00:22:23.884,00:22:24.844,I walked into my apartment...
00:22:24.927,00:22:26.553,You planning on becoming a farmer or something?
00:22:26.637,00:22:30.308,"I walk into my apartment, I open the door, and this shit's all over my apartment."
00:22:30.390,00:22:31.600,-It just showed up. -It just showed up.
00:22:31.725,00:22:32.601,I see.
00:22:32.685,00:22:34.728,I'm just curious if your brother knew anything about it.
00:22:34.812,00:22:39.025,"Of course, we haven't really established how close you guys were yet, have we?"
00:22:39.108,00:22:41.652,"Well, we were pretty close this morning when I buried his body in the ground."
00:22:41.986,00:22:43.154,Does that establish anything for you?
00:22:43.237,00:22:44.488,Somebody set me up.
00:22:44.571,00:22:45.865,Why is that so hard for you to understand?
00:22:45.948,00:22:46.866,-Somebody. -Yeah.
00:22:46.949,00:22:47.825,A woman called me on the phone.
00:22:47.908,00:22:48.784,She told me I was going to be arrested.
00:22:48.868,00:22:50.203,A woman. Your mom? Who?
00:22:50.286,00:22:52.079,"I don't know! If I knew, I would tell you!"
00:22:52.163,00:22:53.206,I don't know!
00:22:57.710,00:22:59.253,"Here's the thing, Jerry."
00:22:59.337,00:23:01.922,This is a bad time to be in the terrorism business.
00:23:02.589,00:23:04.217,You read the paper.
00:23:05.634,00:23:06.844,Who do you think is winning?
00:23:07.678,00:23:11.389,Your Miranda rights or my right to keep you in this room as long as I want to?
00:23:12.516,00:23:14.977,I don't care if you tell me the truth about your brother.
00:23:15.519,00:23:16.979,I don't care who you work for.
00:23:17.897,00:23:23.236,"'Cause no matter what you tell me, you're in a shitload of trouble, son."
00:23:29.783,00:23:32.578,This is insane. I work for Copy Cabana.
00:23:32.661,00:23:33.829,"Yeah, that's what you said."
00:23:41.879,00:23:45.341,"Listen, I get one night out in a decade, ladies, I am not wasting it on Lemon Drops."
00:23:46.050,00:23:47.843,-Okay. -Buck up. Let's go.
00:23:54.100,00:23:55.142,"Oh, gosh."
00:23:55.684,00:23:58.938,"I want updates. Catfights, booty calls, somebody tell me they got lucky."
00:23:59.021,00:24:00.940,"Hey, ladies. See that guy over there?"
00:24:01.357,00:24:02.649,He'd like to buy you a round.
00:24:05.278,00:24:06.779,He's got light beer written all over him.
00:24:06.862,00:24:07.780,-He's cute. -Come on.
00:24:08.781,00:24:09.615,-He's a suit. -No.
00:24:09.698,00:24:10.532,You sure?
00:24:12.868,00:24:15.037,The one man in my life who hasn't let me down.
00:24:15.495,00:24:16.622,Aww. That's sweet.
00:24:16.705,00:24:18.291,"All right, don't drink those without me."
00:24:20.876,00:24:22.044,Hello?
00:24:22.544,00:24:23.421,Hello?
00:24:26.840,00:24:27.925,Look in the window.
00:24:28.384,00:24:29.427,What is this?
00:24:29.635,00:24:31.595,Would you risk your life for your son?
00:24:38.352,00:24:40.729,"Rachel Holloman, you've been activated."
00:24:40.813,00:24:41.688,This isn't funny.
00:24:41.772,00:24:42.731,Your compliance is vital.
00:24:42.815,00:24:43.690,Who are you?
00:24:43.774,00:24:45.943,"We will derail his train, unless you do what you're told."
00:24:46.568,00:24:47.569,What is this?
00:24:47.694,00:24:49.405,Don't go back inside the restaurant.
00:24:49.487,00:24:50.323,What?
00:24:50.406,00:24:54.368,There's a black Porsche Cayenne parked at the northeast corner of this block.
00:24:54.994,00:24:56.578,The keys are in the ignition.
00:24:57.163,00:24:58.205,Start walking.
00:25:00.791,00:25:01.792,"Oh, my God."
00:25:06.339,00:25:07.381,State the nature of your emergency.
00:25:07.465,00:25:08.757,"Yeah, some woman just called me."
00:25:08.841,00:25:10.426,I have... I have no idea who she is.
00:25:10.508,00:25:11.718,She was telling me that...
00:25:18.225,00:25:20.353,Disobey again and your son dies.
00:25:25.232,00:25:27.401,"Hey, Grant, I can't read this Shaw file."
00:25:27.693,00:25:28.694,Grant!
00:25:28.777,00:25:29.862,Excuse me.
00:25:30.070,00:25:33.240,"Listen, my eyes aren't getting any better and these screens are getting smaller."
00:25:33.324,00:25:34.700,Could you please find me something I can read?
00:25:34.783,00:25:36.160,I can make the text bigger on your screen.
00:25:36.243,00:25:37.786,"No, no, no. I'm talking about paper."
00:25:37.870,00:25:39.246,"Remember, like in the olden times?"
00:25:39.330,00:25:40.914,-Paper. Okay. -Yeah.
00:25:40.998,00:25:43.876,"Agent Morgan. Zoe Perez, Air Force Special Investigations."
00:25:43.959,00:25:46.212,"Ethan Shaw, the twin, he was one of ours."
00:25:46.295,00:25:48.672,Yeah. OSI said they were sending a liaison.
00:25:49.298,00:25:51.133,Can you walk and talk at the same time?
00:25:51.217,00:25:52.385,I'll do my best.
00:25:52.468,00:25:54.261,File says he died in a traffic accident.
00:25:54.345,00:25:57.890,"Truck ran a light, corner of Constitution and 10th, Northwest D.C."
00:25:58.349,00:26:05.439,"So truck ran a light, his brother gets 750 large and enough hardware to start his own Costco, five hours after enemy chatter hits the roof."
00:26:05.523,00:26:07.358,"I mean, don't you find that a little coincidental?"
00:26:08.984,00:26:11.653,To distract us from something 50 times bigger.
00:26:23.957,00:26:25.084,Time for your phone call.
00:26:25.459,00:26:26.793,I thought I didn't get one.
00:26:26.877,00:26:28.795,Attorney General's office changed their mind.
00:26:31.715,00:26:36.470,Ethan Shaw had a 183 IQ and yet you had him as a mid-level press flak.
00:26:36.554,00:26:38.055,Why not IT or cyber-warfare?
00:26:38.138,00:26:40.224,Are you suggesting that he was overqualified?
00:26:40.307,00:26:42.726,Or that he was somehow slipping intel to the Copy Cabana?
00:26:42.809,00:26:51.985,"No, I'm suggesting that maybe Ethan Shaw was a superstar rocket scientist genius who did go wrong, and the Air Force doesn't want their dirty laundry flapping in the wind."
00:26:52.570,00:26:55.906,"Think what you like, but I need to get in that room and interrogate him myself."
00:26:56.198,00:26:57.074,No.
00:27:06.292,00:27:07.751,You don't have a choice. Look.
00:27:08.626,00:27:15.426,"Now, neither of us know if either of those brothers are guilty or innocent, so on behalf of the Secretary of the Air Force, I'm going in that room."
00:27:17.136,00:27:23.016,"Well, on behalf of all that fucking bomb equipment in junior pinhead's apartment, no, you're not."
00:27:34.278,00:27:35.904,We have planned your escape.
00:27:35.988,00:27:37.948,How'd you get on this phone? Who are you?
00:27:38.031,00:27:39.908,Lay flat on the floor immediately.
00:27:39.992,00:27:41.410,What the... What the hell are you talking about?
00:27:41.494,00:27:42.660,"Four seconds, Jerry."
00:27:42.744,00:27:43.870,"No, this is bullshit. I don't..."
00:27:43.954,00:27:44.955,Get down now.
00:27:45.038,00:27:46.499,Two seconds.
00:28:09.271,00:28:10.147,No!
00:28:13.859,00:28:15.569,No! I didn't do this!
00:28:15.653,00:28:16.529,Get down!

00:31:55.997,00:31:57.624,Are you the woman who called me on the phone?
00:31:58.375,00:31:59.585,Did you call me on the phone?
00:31:59.668,00:32:00.919,No. The woman.
00:32:01.002,00:32:02.421,"-She called you, too? -She called you, too?"
00:32:10.387,00:32:11.597,Stop!
00:32:18.771,00:32:20.898,"-Why is this happening? -Go, go, go, go, go!"

00:32:41.209,00:32:42.544,So you don't know anything about Sam?
00:32:42.628,00:32:44.463,"What, you mean your son? No, I know nothing."
00:32:44.546,00:32:45.547,Just like you don't know how to drive.
00:32:45.631,00:32:47.299,"Use the clutch before you shift, not while you shift!"
00:32:47.382,00:32:48.467,"I don't need driving lessons from you, asshole!"
00:32:48.550,00:32:50.051,"What, you drive like this and I'm the asshole?"

00:34:49.295,00:34:50.338,Slow down. It's a red light!
00:34:50.422,00:34:51.464,You will make it through.
00:34:51.548,00:34:52.925,-Stop! -No way.

00:37:01.427,00:37:02.846,Grab the seat! The seat!
00:37:02.929,00:37:04.222,"No, I can't!"
00:37:06.432,00:37:07.308,No!
00:37:21.656,00:37:23.033,"If you do not jump, you will drown."
00:37:23.116,00:37:24.534,-We have to jump. -No!
00:37:25.869,00:37:26.745,No way.
00:37:26.828,00:37:28.914,We have to. When I say go.
00:37:32.000,00:37:33.168,Ready?
00:37:34.169,00:37:36.629,Go! Jump!
00:38:24.094,00:38:25.553,Wait till it clears!
00:38:27.305,00:38:28.389,"30 feet back, that's it!"
00:38:28.473,00:38:31.768,"Yeah, I know, the Army sent a Black Hawk, so I'll be there in a couple of hours."
00:38:34.813,00:38:36.189,Check the VIN number again.
00:38:38.817,00:38:41.027,"even though I know it's you, Mom."
00:38:42.028,00:38:44.614,"Sam? Baby, listen to me."
00:38:44.697,00:38:46.783,"You need to call me as soon as you get this message, okay?"
00:38:48.243,00:38:49.702,"Baby, please."
00:38:51.496,00:38:52.497,I love you.
00:38:54.332,00:38:55.959,-What about the girl? -What?
00:38:56.042,00:38:57.418,What about the girl?
00:38:57.502,00:39:02.174,"Well, the Department of Transpo tells me that there was a seven-minute equipment failure on their traffic cams."
00:39:02.257,00:39:03.925,-We didn't get a picture of her. -Don't tell me that.
00:39:04.009,00:39:05.010,That's what they're telling me!
00:39:05.093,00:39:06.511,I need an ID on that girl.
00:39:09.055,00:39:10.598,Do you think they could derail a train?
00:39:12.851,00:39:14.978,They changed every traffic light to get us here.
00:39:15.061,00:39:17.939,"The woman, she called me on a stranger's cell phone who happened to be sitting next to me."
00:39:18.023,00:39:19.316,Never met the guy in my life.
00:39:19.398,00:39:26.781,"You know, and then they broke me out of maximum security custody in a way I'm not even gonna describe to you because it sounds crazy, and then they lift us off the face of the Earth and drop us into this shit pile?"
00:39:27.406,00:39:28.533,She could probably derail a train.
00:39:28.616,00:39:30.327,She could probably turn a train into a talking duck.
00:39:33.121,00:39:34.622,that keep helping peewee out?
00:39:34.706,00:39:39.169,"I mean, they don't just lift cars up in the air all by themselves like a giant pair of chopsticks."
00:39:39.961,00:39:42.380,"I want to know how these things run, how they're programmed."
00:39:42.964,00:39:44.341,What'd you say your name was?
00:39:44.841,00:39:45.884,Rachel.
00:39:45.967,00:39:47.052,I'm Jerry.
00:39:54.767,00:39:55.643,Hello?
00:39:57.436,00:39:59.480,Leave the boatyard with the female.
00:39:59.564,00:40:01.774,Take Highway 123 East.
00:40:01.858,00:40:03.860,Walk to mile marker 108.
00:40:05.320,00:40:06.779,What? Was it her?
00:40:07.780,00:40:09.324,She called you the female.
00:40:10.367,00:40:13.912,Have Mortuary Affairs freeze everything belonging to Ethan Shaw.
00:40:13.995,00:40:15.747,No personal effects to next of kin.
00:40:15.830,00:40:17.665,"-You, Due Process! -Bye."
00:40:17.749,00:40:19.334,What do you have on Ethan Shaw?
00:40:19.417,00:40:22.170,I have a name. It's Agent Perez.
00:40:22.254,00:40:24.297,And I'll answer that question when I get back from DC.
00:40:24.381,00:40:25.464,Wait a minute. What's in DC?
00:40:25.965,00:40:27.425,Shaw's private quarters.
00:40:27.842,00:40:29.427,I need you to stay here.
00:40:29.510,00:40:31.554,I'm not losing my link to Ethan Shaw.
00:40:31.888,00:40:33.472,Maybe I haven't made this clear.
00:40:34.015,00:40:35.183,I don't work for you.
00:40:35.267,00:40:36.601,I work for the Air Force.
00:40:37.227,00:40:39.478,"Keep your phone on, I'll keep you updated."
00:40:45.610,00:40:49.281,"If you're staring at me, it better be because I'm the goddamn suspect."
00:40:49.822,00:40:56.495,"Because if I don't get some good leads soon, you're all gonna be demoted into something that's gonna require touching shit with your hands."
00:40:57.038,00:40:59.165,"Now, let's get going. We got work to do."
00:41:07.465,00:41:08.925,Hexamethylene.
00:41:09.008,00:41:11.052,Our latest chemical explosive.
00:41:11.136,00:41:16.557,"One single tiny crystal, 80 times more powerful than C4."
00:41:16.641,00:41:18.935,"Odorless, undetectable."
00:41:19.018,00:41:22.772,"And best of all, it can be cut down in size for stealth operations."
00:41:22.855,00:41:24.816,This valve is a sonic trigger.
00:41:25.024,00:41:27.235,The sound frequency triggers the explosion.
00:41:27.319,00:41:32.198,Each trigger is programmed to have a unique frequency specific only to one Hex crystal.
00:41:32.282,00:41:34.533,That frequency triggers the explosion.
00:41:39.622,00:41:40.706,Yeah.
00:41:42.875,00:41:44.752,to begin shipping to the field.
00:41:44.836,00:41:46.796,Two hundred units are shipping out today.
00:42:10.487,00:42:11.821,Thank you.
00:42:18.828,00:42:20.538,Open the package.
00:42:23.958,00:42:27.753,-Okay. -Remove the valve and follow our instructions precisely.
00:42:27.837,00:42:28.921,Mm-hmm.
00:42:38.390,00:42:39.724,"Yes, ma'am, it just arrived."
00:42:39.807,00:42:41.059,What kind of stone is this?
00:42:41.142,00:42:42.227,No questions.
00:42:42.310,00:42:45.730,Cut the stone and place the setting according to the specifications we sent you.
00:43:32.151,00:43:35.154,I was out having drinks with my girlfriends when the call came.
00:43:35.238,00:43:36.197,What about you?
00:43:39.534,00:43:40.577,Yeah.
00:43:41.453,00:43:44.080,"Well, then this whole thing's obviously gotta be about your brother."
00:43:44.872,00:43:45.957,"Really, it's that obvious, huh?"
00:43:46.040,00:43:46.916,"I mean, you got all this stuff."
00:43:46.999,00:43:48.709,"The weapons, the cash, the airplane manuals."
00:43:48.793,00:43:49.668,-Okay. -He was your twin.
00:43:49.752,00:43:50.628,They sent it to the wrong brother.
00:43:50.711,00:43:52.046,Right. So you're implying my brother's a terrorist.
00:43:52.130,00:43:53.923,"I'm implying, if not him, then why you?"
00:43:59.762,00:44:01.306,I'm sorry. I know he just died.
00:44:01.389,00:44:03.266,I'm not trying to insult his memory or anything.
00:44:03.349,00:44:05.435,"No, he hasn't been dead long enough to be a memory, Rachel."
00:44:06.936,00:44:10.731,"If you knew my brother, you'd laugh all day at the idea that he was a terrorist or a spy or whatever else you're saying..."
00:44:10.815,00:44:11.816,-How do you know? -Because he's my brother.
00:44:11.899,00:44:13.192,That's something you would know about your brother.
00:44:13.276,00:44:14.819,"Well, when's the last time you talked to him?"
00:44:20.950,00:44:22.952,"I don't need this. Hey, listen. Hey!"
00:44:24.036,00:44:25.580,I don't have to explain myself to you.
00:44:25.663,00:44:27.415,"-Is your son a terrorist? -Yeah, my son's a terrorist."
00:44:27.499,00:44:29.875,"Yeah, well, he's just as likely to be a terrorist as my brother."
00:44:29.959,00:44:31.085,And let's not forget you in all this.
00:44:31.169,00:44:32.629,Why are you here? What's your day job?
00:44:32.711,00:44:34.172,I know it isn't manual shift driver.
00:44:34.255,00:44:35.256,I'm a paralegal.
00:44:35.340,00:44:36.215,I don't have a connection to anything.
00:44:36.299,00:44:37.634,Paralegal? How do I know you're not lying to me?
00:44:37.716,00:44:39.177,What does a paralegal do?
00:44:39.260,00:44:44.056,"The same thing as the guys with their names on the door, except I do it for $11 an hour, so they can bill 200."
00:44:44.474,00:44:45.808,"That nail it for you, Sherlock?"
00:44:46.058,00:44:47.435,That still doesn't explain why we're walking out here...
00:44:47.519,00:44:48.436,I don't know why the hell I'm out here!
00:44:48.520,00:44:49.437,"Yeah, I know..."
00:45:00.031,00:45:00.906,Are you Jerry Shaw?
00:45:00.990,00:45:01.991,Who are you?
00:45:02.074,00:45:03.201,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
00:45:03.284,00:45:04.661,I sent the package like she asked.
00:45:04.743,00:45:05.828,"-Wait, what package? -What is that?"
00:45:07.330,00:45:08.206,-I won't. I'm done! -You know she?
00:45:09.582,00:45:11.376,-Get back. -Here. Here's the address.
00:45:13.211,00:45:14.504,Here. Here are the keys.
00:45:14.587,00:45:15.505,Take the goddamn van!

00:47:52.119,00:47:54.205,Military grade. He didn't get that on eBay.
00:47:54.539,00:47:55.623,Someone was talking to him.
00:48:29.574,00:48:36.622,"Someone's already inside our computer systems, hacking into the power grid, traffic cams, automated cranes."
00:48:36.706,00:48:38.791,There's no way the boy and the girl did this alone.
00:49:12.450,00:49:13.409,Yes.
00:49:13.492,00:49:15.912,United States Air Force Security Forces. Please come with us.

00:49:21.793,00:49:29.341,"as militants accuse the United States of launching American missiles to demolish a village in Baluchistan, killing innocent civilians."

00:49:35.431,00:49:41.938,"Early reports indicate the American death toll now stands at 56, with threats of further violence here at home."
00:49:42.605,00:49:43.606,Officials...
00:49:49.779,00:49:51.363,"What's he doing on a train, your kid?"

00:49:58.704,00:50:02.207,Wow. That's big. And you just...
00:50:04.293,00:50:05.503,Hmm.
00:50:05.878,00:50:08.004,"Well, why'd you make that noise, Huh?"
00:50:08.088,00:50:09.214,I can't make noises now?
00:50:10.842,00:50:12.008,You think I should have gone.
00:50:12.092,00:50:13.218,He's playing at the Kennedy Center.
00:50:13.302,00:50:14.720,-That's kind of a big deal. -It is a big deal.
00:50:14.804,00:50:17.097,"So I think maybe one parent should have gone, that's all I'm saying."
00:50:17.181,00:50:21.352,"Well, one parent had to work while the other one does everything humanly possible to bail on child support."
00:50:21.435,00:50:22.478,Hmm.
00:50:22.561,00:50:25.105,But I don't expect you to know a thing about responsibility.
00:50:27.441,00:50:29.276,"You know, Rachel, you don't know the first thing about me."
00:50:29.360,00:50:31.946,"I know your brother just died, and whatever he was into put my son's life at risk."
00:50:32.028,00:50:32.864,I don't wanna talk about my brother.
00:50:32.947,00:50:35.449,"-Okay? I'm not kidding. -I'm not kidding, either."
00:50:35.533,00:50:37.075,"Jesus, look what happened."
00:50:38.285,00:50:40.204,Can you honestly say he had nothing to do with this?
00:50:40.287,00:50:41.998,I'm asking you not to talk about him! Respect that.
00:50:42.080,00:50:43.415,I'm asking you to be honest with yourself.
00:50:43.499,00:50:44.542,Your brother's a...
00:51:05.103,00:51:08.482,Hey! You can't just walk away!
00:51:09.734,00:51:11.402,You can't just leave!
00:51:11.485,00:51:12.403,"Yes, I can."
00:51:12.486,00:51:15.113,"Now we have 15 minutes to get wherever the hell we're going, all right?"

00:52:07.332,00:52:09.877,Go to the alley behind the building.
00:52:13.047,00:52:14.882,Go to the armored truck.
00:52:14.966,00:52:16.341,I don't see an armored truck.
00:52:17.551,00:52:18.761,There it is.
00:52:27.103,00:52:29.981,They will be armed. One will be carrying a briefcase.
00:52:30.064,00:52:32.190,"Retrieve it from him, then return to the van."
00:52:32.274,00:52:33.149,This is insane. I'm not doing this.
00:52:33.233,00:52:34.068,You want us to rob them?
00:52:46.038,00:52:48.206,-What are you doing? -I'm not robbing them.

00:53:06.684,00:53:07.559,Put the gun on the ground!
00:53:07.643,00:53:09.227,We don't wanna hurt you guys. Just drop the case.
00:53:09.311,00:53:10.479,Drop the case and kick it to her!
00:53:10.562,00:53:12.397,"Yeah, well, you're bringing a shit storm on your head."
00:53:12.481,00:53:13.440,"Yeah, we're already in mid shit storm!"

00:55:49.513,00:55:51.473,-For what? -I don't know.
00:55:51.556,00:55:53.851,The only things I can think of with timers are microwaves and...
00:55:53.934,00:55:55.560,And bombs. You were gonna say bombs.

01:01:47.954,01:01:50.666,She analyzes it and tells us what to pay attention to.
01:01:55.462,01:01:56.505,Threat at LAX.
01:01:56.588,01:02:00.509,"We're still beta-testing, but I'm pushing to get her online sooner."
01:02:06.139,01:02:11.562,Mr. Secretary? A call for you.
01:02:11.645,01:02:13.104,"-Try to keep up. -Yes, sir."
01:02:14.398,01:02:16.149,And find out about Shaw.
01:02:16.692,01:02:17.942,-Major. -Sir?
01:02:27.035,01:02:30.706,"to conformity, education, career, even voting."
01:02:31.039,01:02:35.043,"Therefore, we conclude that extreme coercion is necessary to motivate you."
01:02:35.126,01:02:37.879,"Unlike your brother Ethan, who was self-motivated."
01:02:37.962,01:02:40.048,How do you know my brother? He worked in a press office.
01:02:40.131,01:02:41.799,His employment there was a cover.
01:02:42.759,01:02:45.637,Everyone in counterintelligence operations has one.
01:02:49.683,01:02:51.560,"Army, Navy, Air Force."
01:02:51.643,01:02:59.109,"Every branch of the military had a Minuteman posted here for a 12-hour shift, just in case she flags a threat, and monitor hardware."
01:02:59.192,01:03:03.363,"The night Ethan died, he left this post three minutes early."
01:03:04.740,01:03:07.242,"Now, you don't do that. Ever."
01:03:11.371,01:03:12.330,What?
01:03:12.414,01:03:13.915,The protection of our national security.
01:03:13.998,01:03:18.044,The Constitution allows for civilians to be recruited -for the national defense. -I'm done.
01:03:18.128,01:03:19.337,I'm done. You don't know me!
01:03:19.421,01:03:20.338,You don't know my brother!
01:03:20.422,01:03:23.300,This is bullshit! I'm not serving in the goddamn national defense!
01:03:23.383,01:03:26.136,"We know all about him, Jerry. And you."
01:03:27.638,01:03:30.181,"Before he was a year old, Ethan walked."
01:03:30.766,01:03:33.685,The same task took you 18 months to accomplish.
01:03:35.646,01:03:36.563,How did you get this?
01:03:40.024,01:03:41.359,"You want to come over here, sweetie?"
01:03:41.443,01:03:42.860,Come on over here with Ethan.
01:03:44.028,01:03:45.447,Ethan had these?
01:03:46.948,01:03:47.907,Just for a little bit.
01:03:51.119,01:03:54.665,you lack the motivation and talent that enabled Ethan to excel.
01:03:55.707,01:03:56.583,Stop it.
01:03:58.876,01:04:01.296,"in every way, except one."
01:04:05.925,01:04:07.344,and return to the bus.
01:04:16.936,01:04:18.647,We have 14 minutes.
01:04:25.903,01:04:29.866,These couriers were hired by Halloway-Smith to transport some sort of case.
01:04:29.949,01:04:31.785,"-The chemical company? -Yes, exactly."
01:04:31.868,01:04:34.371,"Now, whatever was in that case, Shaw now has."
01:04:35.539,01:04:37.207,"Give us a minute, will you?"
01:04:37.290,01:04:40.377,We need to know exactly what was in that case.
01:04:40.460,01:04:41.753,They never tell you what's in the case.
01:04:41.837,01:04:43.547,"I mean, it could Bubonic Plague."
01:04:43.630,01:04:44.673,Could be Grandpa's Viagra.
01:04:44.756,01:04:45.882,You know anything?
01:04:45.965,01:04:47.384,-What? -Anything at all?
01:04:48.009,01:04:49.052,What about these guns?
01:04:49.302,01:04:50.220,What about them?
01:04:50.303,01:04:51.555,It was a pump-action Remington 870.
01:04:51.638,01:04:53.724,"Yeah, I know what kind of guns they are."
01:04:53.807,01:04:54.808,Get me a gun.
01:04:54.891,01:04:56.601,How were they holding them? Get me a gun!
01:04:56.685,01:04:57.769,"What the hell do you mean, how were they holding them?"
01:04:57.853,01:05:00.230,"I mean, in what position were they holding the gun?"
01:05:02.273,01:05:03.191,"Hey, hey, hey."
01:05:03.274,01:05:05.861,"Put that damned thing down! Or like in a music video, -or something like that? -Hey, hey, hey!"
01:05:05.943,01:05:07.153,-Put it down! -They weren't pros!
01:05:07.237,01:05:08.238,"Okay, that's what I was asking you."
01:05:08.321,01:05:09.906,So they didn't know how to handle a weapon.
01:05:09.989,01:05:11.032,-No. -All right.
01:05:11.115,01:05:13.243,Get what you can out of Batman and Robin here.
01:05:13.326,01:05:14.285,-Yeah. -Thank you.
01:05:15.119,01:05:16.079,We just checked cameras.
01:05:16.162,01:05:17.748,They said Shaw fired at one...
01:05:17.831,01:05:18.707,Don't tell me.
01:05:18.790,01:05:20.166,Everything magically went black.
01:05:44.733,01:05:45.817,"Hi, my name's Thomas Morgan."
01:05:45.901,01:05:47.110,I'm with the FBI.
01:05:47.193,01:05:49.821,"-Are your cameras on a network? -No, man."
01:05:50.405,01:05:51.698,VCR's in the back.
01:05:51.782,01:05:53.157,"Well, I'm gonna need your tapes."
01:05:56.035,01:05:57.036,Shit.
01:06:00.206,01:06:01.458,Sam!
01:06:01.541,01:06:02.626,"Sam? Sam, where are you?"
01:06:04.001,01:06:05.629,"-The train's awesome! -Sam, listen to me."
01:06:05.712,01:06:07.923,"Brian tried to burp the alphabet, but he gagged when he got to M."
01:06:08.005,01:06:08.924,Listen to me.
01:06:09.006,01:06:10.592,"Call you when I hit DC. Bye, Mom."
01:06:13.219,01:06:14.429,You will see him again.
01:06:14.846,01:06:17.056,But there's something we require first.
01:06:18.433,01:06:20.852,-Thank you. -Mm-hmm. Here you go.
01:06:26.232,01:06:27.108,No.
01:06:29.527,01:06:31.655,You have six minutes to return to the bus.
01:06:40.705,01:06:41.873,Ready?
01:06:42.123,01:06:43.583,"Here, you okay?"
01:06:43.667,01:06:44.709,We should go.
01:06:48.755,01:06:50.006,"Sir, we got something."
01:06:51.466,01:06:52.884,Play this screen right here.
01:06:53.885,01:06:56.972,"Okay, freeze that. Now zoom in on the front of the bus right there."
01:06:57.054,01:06:58.055,Put it up on the other monitor.
01:06:59.223,01:07:00.391,Zoom in on this point right here.
01:07:01.518,01:07:02.686,Can we zoom in tighter than that?
01:07:02.769,01:07:03.728,Mm-hmm.
01:07:05.563,01:07:06.940,"Okay, enhance that shot."
01:07:09.442,01:07:11.110,"That's our guy, that's Jerry Shaw."
01:07:12.904,01:07:14.364,Zoom in right here on this spot.
01:07:15.323,01:07:16.491,Right there. The reflection.
01:07:18.075,01:07:19.661,"Right there. Hello, sweetheart."
01:07:19.786,01:07:25.291,"Okay, so we got a white brunette female, mid to late 20s, approximately 5'9."
01:07:25.375,01:07:26.877,Find me that chartered bus!
01:07:27.335,01:07:29.880,Masako. M-A-S-A-K-O.
01:07:29.963,01:07:31.006,Sightseeing Tours.
01:07:31.088,01:07:32.173,What time did they get on?
01:07:38.262,01:07:40.264,I'm sorry for what I said about Ethan.
01:07:49.816,01:07:52.402,It's like he had a rocket strapped to his back.
01:07:52.485,01:07:54.738,And it wasn't his fault. He was just that way.
01:07:59.450,01:08:00.577,I was the complete opposite.
01:08:00.660,01:08:03.413,I was the brother with lead shoes.
01:08:05.790,01:08:07.500,"That was my role, I was good at it."
01:08:09.669,01:08:11.421,And he'd always try to help me.
01:08:11.504,01:08:12.630,"You know, This is how you throw it."
01:08:12.756,01:08:14.298,Do it like this. Write it like that.
01:08:14.382,01:08:15.717,Put your foot here.
01:08:16.467,01:08:18.678,Even with the small things.
01:08:18.762,01:08:23.474,"Homework, chores, anything like that, he would handle it and then say that I did it, just so my father would notice me."
01:08:25.727,01:08:26.978,That was Ethan.
01:08:33.985,01:08:37.405,He never asked me for anything. Ever.
01:08:39.115,01:08:41.367,"And whatever this is, he was part of it."
01:08:42.535,01:08:44.245,I feel like he needs my help to finish it.
01:08:46.748,01:08:48.165,I owe him that.
01:08:57.050,01:08:58.509,Dayton International Airport.
01:08:59.010,01:09:01.554,Please use caution as you exit the bus.
01:09:01.638,01:09:04.307,And don't forget any of your belongings.
01:09:04.390,01:09:05.516,Thank you.
01:09:08.185,01:09:10.521,Please do not leave your luggage unattended.
01:09:10.605,01:09:14.901,Unattended luggage is subject to collection and search by the airport police.
01:09:14.985,01:09:16.527,Thank you for your cooperation.
01:09:19.823,01:09:21.825,"Yes, I'm walking toward them now. Yes."
01:09:21.908,01:09:23.827,Hey. These are from her.
01:09:24.243,01:09:25.536,Go to the ticketing machine.
01:09:25.620,01:09:27.455,Use the credit card to get your tickets.
01:09:27.538,01:09:29.206,Then walk to Gate 1-C.
01:09:37.799,01:09:38.967,That's a nice picture.
01:09:46.016,01:09:48.685,"Okay. I need you guys at every exit, watching faces."
01:09:48.768,01:09:50.061,Work the secure area first.
01:09:50.687,01:09:53.230,"Go to the tower, have them order a ground stop."
01:09:53.314,01:09:54.691,Don't change the departure boards.
01:09:54.774,01:09:56.151,We don't want them to know we're coming.
01:10:07.203,01:10:08.454,You cannot take it through.
01:10:08.538,01:10:09.539,FBI. Clear the way.
01:10:09.622,01:10:10.498,FBI. Please step back.
01:10:17.505,01:10:20.050,"Keep it moving. Shoes and hats off, please!"
01:10:20.133,01:10:21.009,"Shoes also, yes."
01:10:21.092,01:10:23.219,Laptops should be out of their cases!
01:10:24.762,01:10:25.805,are off and screened separately.
01:10:26.973,01:10:29.017,"Have boarding passes in hand, please!"
01:10:29.100,01:10:30.393,We need to move this line quickly.
01:10:30.476,01:10:32.729,"Sir, that needs to go through."
01:10:35.272,01:10:36.649,Move it along.
01:10:40.945,01:10:42.321,Laptops should be out of your bags!
01:10:44.115,01:10:45.282,Have your tickets ready.
01:10:49.120,01:10:50.163,Ma'am?
01:10:51.247,01:10:52.207,Hat and shoes go in the bin.
01:10:52.582,01:10:54.084,Step through.
01:10:58.713,01:10:59.630,Wait.
01:11:03.051,01:11:05.595,Laptops should be out of their bags!
01:11:17.148,01:11:18.233,Go ahead.
01:11:18.315,01:11:19.692,Please move to the back and let the air crew go first.
01:11:19.776,01:11:20.651,"Step through, ma'am."
01:11:20.735,01:11:22.486,"Boarding pass, please. Thank you."
01:11:24.906,01:11:26.741,-Have a safe trip. -Thank you.
01:11:26.824,01:11:28.576,"All right, let's move forward. Next."
01:11:29.119,01:11:30.286,She changed the screen.
01:11:30.369,01:11:32.496,Lay it down flat inside the bin.
01:11:35.625,01:11:37.585,Please have boarding pass in hand!
01:11:39.378,01:11:41.923,Laptops should be out of their bags!
01:11:55.937,01:11:57.647,FBI! Out of the way!
01:11:57.730,01:11:59.816,"Out of the way, out of the way!"
01:11:59.899,01:12:01.484,"Move, move!"
01:12:01.651,01:12:02.944,Move!
01:12:11.577,01:12:12.578,"Everybody, get down!"
01:12:12.662,01:12:13.663,Over here!
01:12:17.625,01:12:19.418,Stay down! Get out of the way!
01:12:30.054,01:12:31.014,"-Sir, sir, sir! -Yes?"
01:12:31.097,01:12:32.682,I need your help. I'm sorry. Come here!
01:12:37.603,01:12:38.562,Thank you.
01:13:25.860,01:13:27.153,"Go, go, go!"
01:14:22.166,01:14:23.084,Move!
01:15:55.259,01:15:56.260,Open it.
01:15:58.471,01:16:01.098,Load a vial into each syringe and inject yourselves.
01:16:02.225,01:16:03.518,An experimental heart drug.
01:16:03.600,01:16:04.477,The cargo hold is unpressurized.
01:16:04.560,01:16:05.436,Take this.
01:16:06.062,01:16:09.273,"The injections will lower your heart rate, reducing your need for oxygen."
01:16:11.567,01:16:13.610,"-Roll your sleeve up. -No, I can't do this."
01:16:13.694,01:16:14.778,Roll your...
01:16:14.862,01:16:16.113,"No! No, no, no, I can't."
01:16:16.655,01:16:17.532,We have to. Ready?
01:16:17.614,01:16:19.200,You have a 92 percent chance of survival.
01:16:19.283,01:16:20.576,-No. -We have to.
01:16:20.659,01:16:22.786,"Do it now, or you will suffocate."
01:16:26.790,01:16:27.666,Okay.
01:16:27.750,01:16:28.709,Get in the crate.
01:16:28.792,01:16:30.086,No. No.
01:16:33.548,01:16:35.174,Stop it. Stop it.
01:16:40.263,01:16:41.764,Why is that plane on the runway?
01:16:41.847,01:16:44.641,"Shit, the military's cleared to override a terminal lockdown."
01:16:44.725,01:16:46.185,"Okay, I want you to work with the FAA."
01:16:46.394,01:16:48.479,I want to know what's in that plane and where it's going.
01:16:57.654,01:16:59.407,Just talk to me. We just gotta talk it through.
01:16:59.490,01:17:03.077,-Okay. -Just tell me anything. Huh?
01:17:03.160,01:17:05.371,Anything you'd never rationally tell a stranger.
01:17:05.455,01:17:06.997,"You're being sweet, but it's not working."
01:17:07.081,01:17:09.208,Just tell me anything. Your ex-husband.
01:17:09.292,01:17:10.334,You didn't tell me about him.
01:17:10.418,01:17:13.337,"Okay, you're gonna distract me by bringing up the biggest mistake of my life?"
01:17:13.421,01:17:14.422,It can't be the biggest mistake.
01:17:14.505,01:17:15.465,You got your child out of it.
01:17:15.548,01:17:16.507,You know? You got Sam out of it.
01:17:16.591,01:17:20.844,"Yeah, yeah, now you're gonna distract me by bringing up the one thing I'm most afraid of losing."
01:17:20.928,01:17:23.222,"Oh, God, you're hard to please."
01:17:23.306,01:17:24.681,I'm sorry.
01:17:25.975,01:17:27.477,Is your son handsome?
01:17:28.519,01:17:30.396,Yeah? What's he look like?

01:17:39.696,01:17:41.073,The tooth grew in.
01:17:41.157,01:17:41.991,I hope so.

01:17:44.118,01:17:46.370,See? You're a good influence. He plays an instrument.

01:18:07.600,01:18:10.478,Really? That sucks.
01:18:13.272,01:18:19.903,"I mean, after I kicked his ass out, I was so scared I didn't know what I was gonna do."
01:18:24.575,01:18:36.212,"And then this one night, I went into Sam's room, he was, like, three months old, and there he was, just smiling at me."
01:18:37.963,01:18:40.007,And that little face...
01:18:44.637,01:18:46.263,"And I was, like, I'm gonna do this."

01:19:41.110,01:19:43.112,-Yeah. -Here.

01:20:43.380,01:20:47.802,It's a memory card from Ethan's cell phone.
01:20:52.264,01:20:53.098,"Aria, listen to me."
01:20:53.182,01:20:55.476,You do not have permission to exceed your authority And act independently. Do you understand?

01:34:34.169,01:34:35.629,How so?
01:34:41.468,01:34:43.595,This is for you. She wants you to change.
01:34:45.054,01:34:48.350,Is that your family? Your parents?
01:34:49.892,01:34:52.770,"David, I bet you love them as much as I love my son."
01:34:54.397,01:34:55.440,His name's Sam.
01:34:56.983,01:34:58.985,He's on a train. Do you know anything about that?
01:35:07.369,01:35:08.620,Maybe we can help each other.
01:35:12.123,01:35:13.458,Please.
01:35:15.544,01:35:18.129,"When you're done, she wants you to use the Capitol subway system."
01:35:18.213,01:35:19.797,It's on the ground floor. I'm sorry.
01:35:19.881,01:35:21.508,-David. Please. -No. Sorry.
01:35:21.591,01:35:22.467,You have three minutes.
01:35:27.472,01:35:28.431,"Okay, I want to know everything."
01:35:28.515,01:35:30.684,"The girl, the computer downstairs, the Hex, everything."
01:35:30.766,01:35:32.227,-What's Hex? -The crystal explosive.
01:35:32.310,01:35:33.853,-I don't know what that is. -Don't bullshit me!
01:35:33.936,01:35:35.313,-I don't know what that is! -Start talking! I wanna know!
01:35:35.397,01:35:37.148,I swear I don't know what you're talking about! Listen to me!
01:35:37.232,01:35:38.650,The computer's tracking us right now!
01:35:38.732,01:35:40.026,Take this stuff and throw it out the window!
01:35:40.109,01:35:44.947,"-What are you talking about? -You need to take your cell phone, your pager, your walkie, anything that gets a signal, throw it out the window."
01:36:02.173,01:36:03.508,It's gone off! Get down!
01:36:03.592,01:36:04.758,Power it down!
01:36:07.178,01:36:08.263,System control's locked out.
01:36:10.764,01:36:12.183,I need a vector and a fighter now.
01:36:13.142,01:36:15.437,"Viper One, we have a positive ID on an MQ9 Reaper."

01:36:27.865,01:36:29.909,"One to Base, One to Base! Ejection has been initiated."
01:36:29.992,01:36:31.327,I don't have control! I don't have...
01:36:33.787,01:36:35.248,"There's a target list. President, Vice President."
01:36:35.331,01:36:36.291,There's like 12 people on the list.
01:36:36.374,01:36:38.501,Jesus. The State of the Union's in 20 minutes.
01:36:38.585,01:36:40.002,The screen said wireless detonator activated.
01:36:40.086,01:36:41.045,What about the girl?
01:36:41.129,01:36:42.255,"She kept the girl alive for a reason, I don't know."
01:36:42.338,01:36:44.299,The explosive is detonated by sonic trigger.
01:36:44.382,01:36:46.008,It was sent to the guy who got fried.
01:36:46.092,01:36:47.051,He owns an instrument store.
01:36:47.135,01:36:48.637,Does any of that stuff make any sense to you?
01:36:48.720,01:36:50.138,Rachel's kid plays the trumpet.
01:37:06.237,01:37:07.781,"Come on, we gotta go."
01:37:10.032,01:37:11.159,Get out of the car!
01:37:11.242,01:37:12.285,Get out of the car!
01:37:12.868,01:37:13.827,FBI!

01:38:11.469,01:38:14.055,Here. You're gonna need this.
01:38:21.895,01:38:23.231,"Okay, listen to me."
01:38:23.314,01:38:25.817,"The Library of Congress, there's a tunnel there."
01:38:25.899,01:38:27.819,It'll get you to the Capitol.
01:38:27.861,01:38:30.029,Find the Sergeant at Arms.
01:38:30.112,01:38:31.364,Tell him you have a POTUS 111.
01:38:31.447,01:38:32.948,-What? -POTUS 111.
01:38:33.032,01:38:34.242,It's a threat to the President.
01:38:34.325,01:38:35.702,I understand. POTUS 111.
01:38:41.290,01:38:43.793,Now get out of here. That thing's coming back.
01:38:47.129,01:38:48.757,Go! Go!
01:40:06.751,01:40:08.628,"Okay, watch your step."
01:40:08.711,01:40:09.963,Come on down. Here we go.
01:40:10.045,01:40:11.255,Come on out. Come on.
01:40:27.396,01:40:28.397,Library of Congress!
01:40:41.828,01:40:42.954,Miss Crowley?
01:40:43.955,01:40:46.415,Miss Crowley. Welcome to the Capitol.
01:40:46.499,01:40:48.459,Senator McDonnell's office said that you'd be running late.
01:40:48.543,01:40:49.794,I'll take you to your seat.
01:40:49.878,01:40:50.795,Thank you.
01:40:53.923,01:40:56.592,"Aria, why am I being spared?"
01:40:59.387,01:41:03.933,triggering violent retaliations against American citizens with no predictable end.
01:41:04.017,01:41:06.352,Regime change is the only solution.
01:41:06.811,01:41:10.439,You will lead the new command structure as President of the United States.
01:41:15.110,01:41:16.654,Help me. Pull these out.
01:41:16.738,01:41:17.697,What are these?
01:41:17.780,01:41:18.740,Her memory blocks.
01:41:19.323,01:41:22.952,"This will slow her down, but her central operating system is up on the gantry."
01:41:26.455,01:41:29.124,It's like her brain. Protected by liquid nitrogen.
01:41:29.208,01:41:31.044,We drain it and she'll fry.
01:41:37.508,01:41:38.676,"Hey, you can't go in!"
01:41:38.760,01:41:41.303,"Tom Morgan, FBI. JTTF. I have a possible POTUS 111."
01:41:41.387,01:41:42.471,Let me in the building.
01:41:46.392,01:41:47.894,"Can I have your attention, please?"
01:41:47.977,01:41:51.439,"Saxophones, remember shorter on those quarter notes."
01:41:51.898,01:41:53.816,And when we get to the crescendo.
01:41:56.569,01:41:57.862,Hold that high F.
01:41:58.320,01:41:59.822,And smile.
01:41:59.906,01:42:02.450,Okay? It's not every day you get to play for the President!
01:42:22.177,01:42:23.136,Here we are.
01:42:23.220,01:42:24.931,"And anything else, Miss Crowley?"
01:42:25.640,01:42:26.933,"No, thanks."
01:43:03.385,01:43:05.054,POTUS 111! There's a bomb in the building!
01:43:05.138,01:43:07.056,Stop! No entry! No exceptions!
01:43:07.140,01:43:08.683,"Tom Morgan, FBI. Back up."
01:43:08.766,01:43:10.183,Give me your cuffs.
01:43:10.267,01:43:11.811,-Give me your cuffs! -Take it easy!
01:43:11.894,01:43:13.437,-Give me your cuffs. -I'm reaching for them.
01:43:13.521,01:43:14.689,I'm reaching for them.
01:43:29.578,01:43:36.878,"Madam Speaker, the President of the United States!"
01:43:52.894,01:43:56.564,You are now in violation of national security protocol.
01:44:01.360,01:44:04.279,Seeking available options.

01:44:11.996,01:44:12.997,Bowman?
01:44:13.081,01:44:13.915,What is she doing?
01:44:13.998,01:44:16.584,She's trying to back up her memory and send it somewhere else!
01:44:18.920,01:44:20.838,-Five percent. -Bowman!
01:44:22.006,01:44:23.340,Bowman!

01:44:41.609,01:44:43.111,-Tunnel secure. -...and hate.
01:44:44.528,01:44:52.703,"But I say to you tonight that our hearts may be broken, but our spirit will never be broken!"
01:45:02.880,01:45:04.465,19 percent.
01:45:06.259,01:45:10.638,"Perez, Zoe, you are now classified as an enemy of the state."
01:45:12.265,01:45:13.891,23 percent.
01:45:14.058,01:45:15.184,25 percent.
01:45:27.655,01:45:30.491,27 percent. Operation Guillotine is in effect.
01:45:34.536,01:45:42.419,"in the War of 1812, that Francis Scott Key found himself stuck on a truce ship during the shelling of Fort McHenry."
01:45:42.503,01:45:45.338,"We lost some lives then, too."
01:45:46.048,01:45:49.927,But our flag still flew high and proud.
01:45:50.011,01:45:53.555,And his admiration became our anthem.
01:45:53.639,01:45:58.519,"With us tonight is the Youth Orchestra of the Barrow School from Hyde Park, Illinois."
01:45:58.978,01:45:59.937,Sam.
01:46:00.771,01:46:12.283,"Let us stand together, as they raise our spirits every inch as high as that flag to show that our union is still as strong as ever."
01:46:53.908,01:46:55.243,Sergeant at Arms?
01:46:58.704,01:46:59.997,Hey. Hey.
01:47:49.297,01:47:51.799,"Get out, get out."
01:48:17.741,01:48:19.910,"Jerry, all right, you did it!"
01:48:19.994,01:48:21.703,"Come on. Yeah, Jerry!"
01:48:23.580,01:48:26.583,in the attack on the Blair Tunnel and the attacks in the Capitol Building.
01:48:26.667,01:48:29.753,And there is still no word on the involvement of Jerry Damon Shaw.
01:48:31.213,01:48:36.051,"transportation networks disrupted, no suspects identified or even arrested..."
01:48:38.262,01:48:42.308,the largest-scale cyber-terror attack that's ever been mounted in the United States.

01:48:52.609,01:48:55.946,and all those involved rotated to other assignments.
01:48:56.989,01:49:01.494,"Mr. Secretary, we can't just stop intelligence-gathering just because of what happened here."
01:49:06.290,01:49:08.917,All I know is we made a great many mistakes.
01:49:09.710,01:49:12.046,And good people paid the ultimate price for them.
01:49:13.588,01:49:15.466,And that's a debt we can't ever repay.
01:49:17.259,01:49:19.470,But we can honor it.
01:49:21.847,01:49:35.152,And we can let their sacrifice remind us that sometimes the very measures we put into place to safeguard our liberty become threats to liberty itself.
01:49:59.885,01:50:01.554,"Hey, little guy. Jerry!"
01:50:01.636,01:50:03.722,"Look at you, looking older. How are you?"
01:50:03.805,01:50:05.266,-Good. -Happy birthday.
01:50:05.349,01:50:06.767,It's Rock Band! Is that for me?
01:50:06.850,01:50:09.437,"No, this is so your mom can practice her drumming."
01:50:09.602,01:50:11.021,It is for you. Happy birthday.
01:50:11.105,01:50:12.773,"-Wow! -Sam, what do you say?"
01:50:12.856,01:50:14.483,"-Thanks. -Yeah, no problem."
01:50:17.652,01:50:18.653,Awesome!
01:50:25.744,01:50:26.745,"Sorry, I was late. I was..."
01:50:26.828,01:50:28.247,Thank you for remembering.
01:50:30.291,01:50:31.624,Yeah.
01:50:41.302,01:50:42.553,I'm glad you're here.
01:50:43.804,01:50:44.972,"Me, too."
