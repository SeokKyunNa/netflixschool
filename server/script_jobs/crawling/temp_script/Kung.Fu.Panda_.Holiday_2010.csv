00:01:29.464,00:01:31.508,"Po, don't go!"
00:01:31.633,00:01:34.177,You can't leave me alone!
00:01:34.302,00:01:35.721,Ah!

00:01:40.434,00:01:41.977,"Oh, I was dreaming."
00:01:42.185,00:01:45.856,"We were cooking, but then you left me."
00:01:45.981,00:01:48.442,"Now, how could you leave me?"
00:01:48.567,00:01:49.985,"Dad, it was just a dream."
00:01:50.193,00:01:51.862,I'm not goin' anywhere.
00:01:51.987,00:01:53.739,"Now, come on down."
00:01:53.864,00:01:55.323,"Thank you, Po."
00:01:55.449,00:01:58.744,You are such a good son.
00:01:58.869,00:02:00.955,You owe me 17 yuan for the new door.
00:02:07.669,00:02:10.047,It's the sun lantern I made when I was a cub.
00:02:10.213,00:02:11.632,"You know why it was on top, Po?"
00:02:11.757,00:02:15.677,Because I opened the box this summer just to look at it.
00:02:15.803,00:02:20.515,"I love Winter Festival so much, sometimes I just can't wait."
00:02:20.641,00:02:24.227,"- Me, too. The decorations..."

00:02:37.783,00:02:39.326,...Empty Belly Defense.
00:02:39.451,00:02:41.996,"Mr. Ping, may I borrow Po for a moment?"

00:02:52.255,00:02:54.842,"No, Po, you will not be invited."
00:02:54.967,00:02:56.259,You will be hosting.

00:02:59.262,00:03:01.849,- Hoo-hoo!
00:03:01.974,00:03:07.437,"As the Dragon Warrior, this is one of your most critical duties."

00:03:17.531,00:03:20.034,"I'll bet you got the best, biggest, brightest sun lanterns and dancing."
00:03:20.159,00:03:23.328,Po. Stop. Stop.
00:03:24.538,00:03:25.998,It is perfection.
00:03:26.123,00:03:29.126,Always elegant.
00:03:29.292,00:03:33.505,Awesome. Awesome.
00:03:35.382,00:03:38.093,- You have some noodle in your neck fat.
00:03:38.301,00:03:43.015,"What I'm saying, Po, is dancing and sun lanterns, those are common traditions."
00:03:43.140,00:03:45.600,So common.
00:03:47.686,00:03:49.188,Weak. Dad! Isn't this great?
00:03:51.815,00:03:53.650,Dragon Warrior!
00:03:53.775,00:03:55.069,- There are bandits at the bridge!
00:03:55.194,00:03:56.820,"I'm on it. See ya, Dad!"
00:03:56.945,00:03:59.990,"- Thanks again, Master Shifu!"
00:04:00.115,00:04:01.116,Mr. Ping.
00:04:13.879,00:04:15.214,"- Hey, guys!"
00:04:15.338,00:04:17.216,You excited about the Winter Feast?
00:04:17.340,00:04:21.011,Guess what? Master Shifu just told me I'll be joining you this year.
00:04:21.136,00:04:23.222,The Feast is intense!

00:04:25.640,00:04:27.517,It's an honor to be invited.
00:04:27.642,00:04:28.936,"Actually, I'm not just invited."
00:04:29.603,00:04:31.354,I'm hosting!
00:04:33.440,00:04:35.984,- Wouldn't be my choice.
00:04:36.110,00:04:38.028,- What?
00:04:38.153,00:04:40.363,...elegant.
00:04:40.488,00:04:42.866,It's a very sophisticated event.
00:04:42.991,00:04:46.078,Why does everyone think I can't do sophisticated?
00:04:47.788,00:04:50.916,I... have no idea.
00:04:51.041,00:04:54.253,It's just that we think maybe you could use a little help.
00:04:54.377,00:04:56.255,"Tigress, I got this."
00:04:56.379,00:04:58.799,It's a dinner.
00:04:58.924,00:05:01.509,- How much do you have to know?
00:05:03.386,00:05:05.180,There are 18 gestures you must memorize for the right hand.
00:05:05.388,00:05:06.723,Nineteen for the left.
00:05:06.848,00:05:09.517,"Nineteen for the right, 19, 18 for the left."
00:05:09.643,00:05:11.645,"This is Feng, the palace artist."
00:05:11.770,00:05:12.646,He will do your official portrait.
00:05:12.771,00:05:15.398,Pleased to... Ew! What?
00:05:15.482,00:05:18.193,"OK, I'm gonna need a do-over."
00:05:18.401,00:05:21.029,seat all of the Kung Fu Masters.
00:05:21.155,00:05:22.489,"Oh, my dad's gonna love this feast."
00:05:22.614,00:05:25.075,"You know, he's never even been to the palace?"
00:05:25.200,00:05:27.661,"I am sorry, Po."
00:05:29.246,00:05:30.789,I can't bring my dad?
00:05:30.914,00:05:33.500,But he's my dad. We always spend the holiday together.
00:05:35.418,00:05:42.050,I remember the day I departed my family and committed myself entirely to the duties of kung fu.
00:05:42.176,00:05:48.515,"You are the Dragon Warrior now, and therefore this is your duty above all other bonds."
00:05:48.640,00:05:53.145,"Now... in your quest for perfection, these instructions must be executed to the letter."
00:05:53.270,00:05:56.564,Guard these scrolls containing the ancient recipes.
00:05:56.690,00:05:57.565,Flaked jasmine. Never ground...
00:06:00.527,00:06:04.031,...elegant... traditional greeting of the Masters...
00:06:04.156,00:06:06.700,- ...magnificent Golden Ladle!
00:06:06.825,00:06:10.287,Po. Hire a chef.
00:06:11.621,00:06:12.706,Do you have any questions?
00:06:12.831,00:06:16.335,- Nuh-uh!
00:06:16.459,00:06:19.046,"Don't worry, Master Shifu, I got everything under control..."
00:06:21.923,00:06:22.924,What? Ohh!
00:06:29.931,00:06:31.808,We have brought you the finest chefs in China.
00:06:31.933,00:06:34.477,- You'll sample their dishes and make your choice.
00:06:34.561,00:06:37.189,The chef you select will receive the Golden Ladle.
00:06:37.314,00:06:39.316,- Let us begin.
00:06:40.942,00:06:46.323,I present Chef Wo Hop of the Heilongjiang Province.
00:06:46.489,00:06:51.912,"Sir, it is a privilege for me and the citizens of my village - to be considered for this great honor."
00:06:52.037,00:06:54.622,Hey!
00:06:54.748,00:06:58.293,- What just happened?
00:06:54.748,00:07:00.254,"- Well... as host of the festival, every gesture of yours has meaning."
00:07:00.503,00:07:04.049,You just gave him the ancient Hun Shu Wave of Dismissal.
00:07:04.174,00:07:06.676,The what? Is that a thing?
00:07:06.801,00:07:11.514,"He has brought great dishonor upon himself and his village, and they will be shamed for all of eternity."
00:07:17.520,00:07:19.522,"No, no! I was just waving to Monkey!"
00:07:19.647,00:07:21.524,- Can't we just get the rabbit back?
00:07:21.566,00:07:25.279,"Oh, you're serious? No."
00:07:25.404,00:07:27.864,I'll get the other chefs.
00:07:27.989,00:07:31.868,"Wow, this feast is intense."
00:07:31.993,00:07:35.414,And I just found out that I can't be with my dad.
00:07:35.538,00:07:39.418,Wait a minute. Of course!
00:07:39.542,00:07:42.212,I'll choose my dad!
00:07:42.337,00:07:45.257,Brilliant! You are good.
00:07:47.008,00:07:48.676,OK... I've got to get rid of these guys.
00:07:48.802,00:07:51.596,Hate the food. Hate the food.
00:07:53.098,00:07:54.599,"Oh, this..."
00:07:54.724,00:07:56.559,...isn't really what we're looking for.
00:07:58.561,00:08:00.897,Nope.
00:08:01.022,00:08:02.274,This isn't really your year.
00:08:02.399,00:08:04.859,No. Nope. Nuh-uh.
00:08:04.985,00:08:06.987,Nah. No. Nah. Mm-mm.
00:08:07.112,00:08:10.282,Ew. Sorry.
00:08:10.407,00:08:12.575,No. No. None of these will do.
00:08:12.700,00:08:14.702,I'll take that. Thank you.
00:08:14.828,00:08:17.247,"Nice try, everyone."
00:08:17.372,00:08:23.086,- Mm. Awful.
00:08:26.465,00:08:28.300,The Golden Ladle!
00:08:28.425,00:08:29.968,- I'm holding it.
00:08:30.093,00:08:31.803,- Yeah.
00:08:30.093,00:08:33.638,- To be asked to prepare a meal for all the great Kung Fu Masters!
00:08:33.763,00:08:35.598,What an extraordinary honor!
00:08:35.682,00:08:37.600,When is it?
00:08:37.642,00:08:40.103,- Tomorrow night.
00:08:40.228,00:08:43.148,- What? Why?
00:08:43.273,00:08:46.360,- Exactly!
00:08:46.485,00:08:49.029,- Why not?
00:08:49.154,00:08:53.450,What about those lonely people who have no place else to go?
00:08:53.616,00:08:55.827,We give them a place to call home.
00:08:55.952,00:08:58.621,There's always room for one more at Mr. Ping's.
00:08:58.663,00:09:02.334,"OK, Dad, I appreciate that you care for all the lonely people."
00:09:02.459,00:09:06.754,- And lonely people pay extra.
00:09:06.880,00:09:10.091,The Feast is tomorrow.
00:09:10.217,00:09:13.261,"in the land, huh? Really?"
00:09:13.387,00:09:17.015,You think your fancy palace ladle is better than mine?
00:09:18.266,00:09:19.809,This is not my A ladle.
00:09:19.934,00:09:22.145,"Dad, look."
00:09:22.270,00:09:25.106,It's just I thought this was a way for us to be together on the holiday.
00:09:25.232,00:09:27.817,- I want us to be together.
00:09:27.942,00:09:29.652,I have responsibilities to Shifu!
00:09:29.694,00:09:31.654,So be there with Shifu.
00:09:31.696,00:09:33.740,Don't you see my beak smiling with happiness for you?
00:09:33.865,00:09:36.951,"No, no, no. Come on, Dad!"
00:09:37.077,00:09:38.912,Don't make me feel guilty about this.
00:09:39.037,00:09:41.289,What... What do you expect me to do?
00:09:41.415,00:09:45.335,"I expect you to do the right thing, Po."
00:09:45.460,00:09:48.671,"Here, son. You should have this on the holiday."
00:09:55.678,00:09:57.180,How could my dad say no?
00:09:57.305,00:09:59.099,"I would rather you stay here, do my holiday thing with me."
00:09:59.224,00:10:02.143,"Yeah, fine. Whatever!"
00:10:02.269,00:10:03.186,Now I gotta cook all alone!
00:10:03.311,00:10:05.063,- Po?
00:10:05.188,00:10:08.483,All alone?
00:10:08.608,00:10:10.777,"No, no, of course I have a chef."
00:10:10.902,00:10:13.113,No chef...
00:10:15.532,00:10:17.033,I gotta get a chef. Ah!
00:10:17.158,00:10:20.370,- Pardon me?
00:10:20.495,00:10:26.876,"Listen, I know we got off to kind of a rocky start, what with me shaming you and your village for all eternity and whatnot."
00:10:27.001,00:10:28.587,But if you could start dicing those carrots...
00:10:28.711,00:10:30.630,I am not here to dice carrots.
00:10:30.755,00:10:32.715,- I am here to fight you.
00:10:32.840,00:10:36.136,The only way I can lift the veil of shame is to fight the Dragon Warrior.
00:10:36.261,00:10:40.807,"Surely I will die, but it will restore my honor!"
00:10:42.309,00:10:43.726,- What are you doing?
00:10:43.851,00:10:46.229,Come on! I don't wanna hurt you.
00:10:43.851,00:10:48.689,"Look, Bunny, I get this whole honor thing."
00:10:48.815,00:10:54.946,"You're biting me. Ha! Look, Bunny, I have enough on my plate between cooking and my dad guilting me. Get off..."
00:10:55.071,00:10:56.030,What is it with parents and the holidays?
00:10:56.156,00:10:58.533,Sometimes they love us too much.
00:10:58.658,00:11:02.454,"But, it is not my place to say."
00:11:02.579,00:11:03.788,"Oh, you gotta be kidding me."
00:11:03.913,00:11:05.748,- OK.
00:11:05.873,00:11:07.750,- There you go.
00:11:07.875,00:11:09.877,"Po, the table is not set."
00:11:10.003,00:11:12.005,- Have you started cooking?
00:11:12.130,00:11:13.840,- Are you ready?
00:11:16.801,00:11:19.012,"Oh, sorry. Ow!"
00:11:19.137,00:11:22.641,"Wha...? Tap, tap, tap."
00:11:22.765,00:11:25.977,Of course he's never here when you need him.
00:11:26.102,00:11:28.647,Po? The vocalist for the band quit.
00:11:28.771,00:11:32.775,for this moment my whole life.
00:11:32.859,00:11:35.570,- Let's just go instrumental.
00:11:35.778,00:11:36.571,This is an embarrassment.
00:11:36.779,00:11:38.573,Po?

00:12:28.665,00:12:32.835,And me. I'm not dead yet.
00:12:32.877,00:12:37.131,What kind of Dragon Warrior am I if I can't even pull off a dinner?
00:12:37.257,00:12:39.842,I guess kung fu can't solve everything.
00:12:41.135,00:12:43.597,That's it!
00:12:43.722,00:12:45.848,Mantis! Crane! Monkey!

00:13:09.748,00:13:15.086,"And you, Bunny... if you even want me to think about your death with honor, you're gonna have to help me in the kitchen. Let's go!"
00:13:39.152,00:13:43.197,"Twenty-nine place settings, 40 chopsticks each."
00:13:43.323,00:13:45.366,Every detail just right.
00:13:45.492,00:13:47.577,- Even down to the ground jasmine.

00:15:37.019,00:15:39.313,- Po?
00:15:39.439,00:15:44.819,"I thought you might forget the words, Po, so I took the liberty of writing them on your napkin."

00:15:55.872,00:16:00.334,"Anyway, um, let me just say something."
00:16:00.460,00:16:03.713,The Creed of the Masters is amazing.
00:16:03.838,00:16:05.924,"It's, like, the coolest creed ever."
00:16:06.048,00:16:09.218,"And, uh, you Masters..."
00:16:09.343,00:16:10.595,I don't even have to tell you.

00:16:31.783,00:16:35.870,"But every Feast, my dad and I spend all day cooking together."
00:16:36.078,00:16:42.460,"And the whole neighborhood shows up. And it gets really loud and crazy, and my Uncle Yang ends up laughing so hard, noodles spurt out his nose."
00:16:42.585,00:16:44.587,- I'd like to see that.
00:16:44.712,00:16:50.760,"So, uh, I wish I could stay and be a good host, but I think I need to leave and..."
00:16:54.096,00:16:57.684,- ...be a good son.
00:16:57.809,00:17:00.394,- What are we supposed to...?

00:17:39.559,00:17:41.310,"Now, don't we have some cookin' to do?"
00:18:04.000,00:18:05.710,"Mm-hm, mm-hm."
