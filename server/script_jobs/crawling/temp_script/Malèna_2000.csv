00:01:05.607,00:01:10.737,"This afternoon at five, Mussolini will speak to all Italians!"
00:01:13.615,00:01:30.465,"You are authorized to interrupt your work. Comrades of Castelcuto, turn your radios on outside, in the street, to my father This afternoon at five, Il Duce will speak to the nation."
00:01:36.346,00:01:37.848,when I saw her for the first time.
00:01:37.931,00:01:39.057,Fascist command!
00:01:39.266,00:01:40.475,I remember it well.
00:01:40.851,00:01:46.607,"That day, Mussolini declared war on France and Great Britain, and I got my first bicycle."
00:01:49.151,00:01:57.159,"the handlebar is D'Ambrosio, the rims are Bianchi, the forks are Legnano, and gears by Vittoria and Margherita Atala. A work of art."
00:01:57.326,00:01:59.828,"But the chain is new, always keep it greasy."
00:01:59.911,00:02:00.829,-Got it? -Yes.
00:02:00.996,00:02:04.082,-Are you sure it's safe? -I have new bikes too.
00:02:04.166,00:02:08.253,"Mimi, we're at war. Who can afford a new bicycle?"
00:02:13.759,00:02:16.803,"on land, on sea and in the air."
00:02:17.929,00:02:35.656,"Blackshirts of the revolution, men and women of Italy and the Kingdom of Albania, hear this, of Our Great Leader, everyone in town was happy that Italy was going to war."
00:02:36.573,00:02:38.867,Maybe they didn't understand that our lives were in danger.
00:02:57.719,00:03:02.808,of decisions from which there is no return.
00:03:07.229,00:03:08.313,Who knows?
00:03:14.945,00:03:18.198,has already been delivered to the ambassadors.
00:03:36.007,00:03:38.552,I'm free from misery. Mary's son is my Lord.
00:03:45.809,00:03:49.146,"Lucky bastard, he's got a new bicycle!"
00:03:50.105,00:03:52.482,-It's beautiful! -Wonderful!
00:03:52.649,00:03:54.317,It's almost brand-new.
00:03:54.401,00:03:57.195,"-Man, it's beautiful! -Do you like it?"
00:03:57.320,00:03:59.740,"Custom-made, just like the racers."
00:03:59.990,00:04:02.534,"-Now you're a man like us. -So, I can join the gang?"
00:04:03.744,00:04:05.787,-What do you think? -Okay by me.
00:04:06.204,00:04:08.123,-And you? -I'd let him in.
00:04:08.999,00:04:11.001,-And you? -Sure.
00:04:11.168,00:04:12.335,"And you, Don Sasà?"
00:04:12.586,00:04:16.089,I don't want some kid poking into our business.
00:04:16.214,00:04:19.092,-Why? What are you doing? -Can you keep your mouth shut?
00:04:33.023,00:04:36.026,"If you wanna be one of us, just shut up and watch."
00:05:29.538,00:05:31.790,"The deaf guy's daughter, our Latin teacher."
00:05:31.873,00:05:35.126,-What's her name? -What a wonderful ass!
00:06:02.362,00:06:06.908,It is categorical and imperative for everyone.
00:06:09.035,00:06:11.079,What I wouldn't give for an hour with her!
00:06:11.162,00:06:16.793,Too bad she's married. If she weren't… What's her name?
00:06:26.970,00:06:29.514,The sun is bigger than the moon.
00:06:33.685,00:06:37.480,"That is, the sun is bigger than the moon."
00:06:38.023,00:06:40.567,"Professor, can I screw your daughter, Malèna?"
00:06:43.111,00:06:46.406,I love honesty more than wealth.
00:06:52.412,00:06:56.833,"That is, I love honesty more than wealth."
00:07:04.966,00:07:08.929,"One, two, three, and two is five, two is seven and two is nine."
00:07:15.685,00:07:18.063,Once Malèna called out to me.
00:07:18.146,00:07:21.858,I skipped school and went by Malèna's house.
00:07:22.108,00:07:24.444,She was at the window as if she was waiting for me.
00:07:24.653,00:07:26.237,She wanted me to get her some cigarettes.
00:07:26.738,00:07:29.115,I went in real close to get the money.
00:07:29.407,00:07:31.451,"And as I got closer, her robe fell open."
00:07:31.868,00:07:33.995,"And there she was, naked as the day she was born."
00:07:35.872,00:07:38.708,She did it on purpose to excite me. I was an idiot.
00:07:38.792,00:07:40.085,I should have jumped at the chance.
00:07:40.585,00:07:44.005,"If it happens again, I'll bang her brains out."
00:07:44.214,00:07:47.759,She'd quit smoking first. She knows you've got no balls.
00:07:47.968,00:07:54.307,"You little runt, you've been here for two hours and you still haven't measured yourself."
00:07:57.894,00:08:08.071,"One, two, three, four, five-- You know what they say about a kid in short pants?"
00:08:11.241,00:08:13.284,Fuck off. My thumbs are twice as big as yours!
00:08:13.410,00:08:14.285,Bullshit!
00:08:18.206,00:08:21.001,"-Who's got the biggest dick now, runt? -You do!"
00:08:21.167,00:08:23.294,"No, I am Il Duce! Nobody's bigger than me!"
00:09:27.609,00:09:30.820,"You, come here! I need some cigarettes."
00:09:41.748,00:09:42.916,What cigarettes do you want?
00:09:44.793,00:09:46.252,Macedonia Extra.
00:10:05.105,00:10:08.274,I remember this suit very well. It's your father's.
00:10:09.359,00:10:13.488,"I sewed it 20 years ago, and it still looks brand-new."
00:10:13.613,00:10:17.242,He only wore it to his wedding. He wants to keep it for his funeral.
00:10:17.367,00:10:21.830,"If he's buried in this suit, he'll go straight to heaven!"
00:10:21.955,00:10:26.751,-My father's still young. -And you're too young for long pants.
00:10:26.835,00:10:29.087,"I didn't ask for your opinion, sir."
00:10:29.212,00:10:31.548,"-Does he know about this? -Of course, he does!"
00:10:32.048,00:10:34.968,"You little scoundrel, what the hell is this?"
00:10:35.093,00:10:36.636,"Come here, mister."
00:10:40.140,00:10:42.308,Fine. Who didn't at your age?
00:10:42.392,00:10:45.812,-Leave him alone! -I know what I'm doing.
00:10:48.231,00:10:52.193,And you let your friends beat you up. Fair enough.
00:10:52.277,00:10:56.197,"Even though when I was your age, I'd beat my friends up!"
00:11:01.035,00:11:05.415,…and getting them altered for yourself is just plain wrong!
00:11:07.458,00:11:10.211,Understand? Who said you could speak?
00:11:10.295,00:11:12.463,I'm ashamed to wear short pants!
00:11:12.714,00:11:14.716,What about knickers? They're almost long pants!
00:11:14.841,00:11:16.593,Enough! He's still a child!
00:11:16.676,00:11:21.097,I'll tell our party secretary you won't let me go to the Fascist exercises.
00:11:27.312,00:11:28.521,Let's make a deal.
00:11:30.231,00:11:39.741,"The day someone cracks the skull of Our Great Leader, -then you'll get long pants. -Swear it."
00:11:40.992,00:11:44.704,A beautiful young woman all alone here. It's a crime.
00:11:45.830,00:11:49.042,"-Who's he talking about? -Malèna Scordia, Nino's sexy wife."
00:11:49.125,00:11:52.045,"She must have somebody on the side, it's inevitable!"
00:11:52.170,00:11:53.963,-Number 15! -Me.
00:11:58.259,00:12:02.222,"Who knows? Two weeks after the wedding, Nino's called to the war."
00:12:02.347,00:12:04.807,Who here wants to bet she's sleeping all alone?
00:12:10.146,00:12:12.190,Why don't you let me sit with the others?
00:12:12.273,00:12:15.818,You're too young to sit in the adult chair.
00:13:47.785,00:13:51.581,Reports of fuel and food shortages are beginning to mount.
00:13:56.419,00:14:03.384,…rationing of flour and sugar will continue.
00:15:25.508,00:15:29.178,"But, son, if you don't know the title, how can I help you?"
00:15:29.303,00:15:31.597,"It's that pretty, romantic one."
00:15:35.268,00:15:38.187,Ma L'Amore No. Why didn't you say so?
00:15:38.271,00:15:40.231,Alida Valli's song.
00:15:41.858,00:15:43.276,Ten lire. Pay at the cashier's.
00:15:43.651,00:15:45.236,-Don't you test it? -What for?
00:15:45.403,00:15:47.822,-It might be defective. -It's brand-new.
00:17:16.619,00:17:26.963,"Miss Malèna, this heart of mine, on fire, has written so many letters, and if I didn't have the courage to send them to you, it was only because I didn't want to do you harm."
00:17:27.922,00:17:31.175,"So, forgive me if I dare to send you this one."
00:17:31.509,00:17:39.100,"I want you to know that this town has many gossips who say bad things about you, that you have a secret lover."
00:17:39.475,00:17:42.812,I know it's not true. You don't have anyone.
00:17:43.104,00:17:46.607,"After your husband, the only man in your life is me."
00:17:58.911,00:18:01.122,That ass!
00:18:01.789,00:18:04.542,I have to go. I'll see you at school tomorrow.
00:18:22.310,00:18:26.856,-Looking for a job again? -But who will ever hire her?
00:18:29.483,00:18:56.427,I've got a job for her… Mr. Lawyer! What should I do with those documents?
00:18:56.510,00:18:58.596,Wait just a little while longer.
00:19:10.983,00:19:12.818,"Good morning, Signora Malèna, are you well?"
00:19:12.902,00:19:14.862,How is your father? May I?
00:20:58.340,00:21:01.093,"-Confess, you're cheating! -No, Renato, I love only you!"
00:21:07.600,00:21:09.185,-Amoroso. -Here!
00:21:09.268,00:21:10.936,-Cali. -Here!
00:21:11.061,00:21:12.480,-Costanza. -Here!
00:21:12.563,00:21:13.564,Iddio.
00:21:13.689,00:21:16.233,"Professor, can I get a blow job from your daughter Malèna?"
00:21:16.317,00:21:20.988,-Can I put my dick between her tits? -Can I put mine in her behind?
00:21:39.423,00:21:40.925,I'm sure no one wanted her.
00:21:47.097,00:21:51.101,"-I wonder what men see in her. -She's so gaudy, so vulgar."
00:22:00.236,00:22:02.363,My son says she looks fake.
00:22:02.446,00:22:04.406,My husband says he wouldn't touch her with a ten-foot pole.
00:22:09.161,00:22:11.372,At least she does everything in the open.
00:22:15.417,00:22:19.129,"And the other days, she has fun with the youngsters at the movie theater."
00:22:19.296,00:22:21.215,"Screws them short and tall, and God forgives all."
00:23:14.935,00:23:21.567,Our brave and invincible fighting men have delivered a powerful blow to the faceless war machine unleashed by the Allies.
00:23:21.650,00:23:46.425,"In order to ensure the continued strength and vitality of our forces at the front, all payment of civic pensions will again be postponed… -It's ready. -Thank you."
00:24:25.965,00:24:28.676,"Renato, you've got the biggest gun in the West!"
00:24:33.472,00:24:38.644,You're going to go blind!
00:24:46.944,00:24:48.112,Malèna.
00:24:49.780,00:24:53.450,"Eyes front! Arms out, arms high, in quick succession!"
00:24:53.575,00:24:57.287,"One, two, one, two, one, two."
00:24:57.371,00:24:59.540,Have you heard? Malèna's husband was killed.
00:24:59.665,00:25:03.085,My father told me. He read the telegram.
00:25:08.424,00:25:17.516,we are gathered here today to share in the tragic but honorable mourning which has struck our town.
00:25:18.017,00:25:28.819,"To express our deepest condolences for the loss of Lieutenant Antonino Scordia, heroically killed in action in East Africa."
00:25:30.195,00:25:36.744,"And to his bride, Maddalena, who, stricken with grief, unfortunately isn't here with us."
00:25:46.211,00:25:51.091,"with their hardships, with their sacrifices, march shoulder to shoulder with fighting men."
00:25:57.056,00:26:01.560,The martyrdom of our fellow citizen in defense of his country was not a useless sacrifice.
00:26:06.440,00:26:08.108,A lucky girl will catch him.
00:26:08.192,00:26:11.737,That will carry us to the final victory of the Fascist Empire!
00:26:20.829,00:26:22.122,Long live Il Duce!
00:27:47.708,00:27:52.254,"From now on, I'll be at your side. Forever. I promise."
00:27:53.213,00:27:55.132,Just give me time to grow up.
00:28:05.225,00:28:07.019,"Now, she'll take a lover for sure."
00:28:07.102,00:28:10.272,"Once in the sack, there's no looking back!"
00:28:10.355,00:28:15.152,She knows that. She's 27 years old. She knows her way around the block!
00:28:15.444,00:28:18.197,"Cusimano, the dentist, has gone crazy for her."
00:28:18.322,00:28:24.203,"Yesterday, he was distracted as she walked by and pulled a healthy tooth instead of the rotten one!"
00:28:25.454,00:28:28.665,"Dentist or not, why haven't we seen her lately?"
00:28:28.790,00:28:31.084,"Guess, she's too busy!"
00:28:34.671,00:28:39.551,They say she's fooling around with a shopkeeper in Catania with subversive tendencies.
00:28:39.676,00:28:43.055,"Some say Cusimano, the dentist."
00:28:43.138,00:28:47.768,-A family man. It's disgraceful! -When you're a born whore.
00:28:47.935,00:28:54.524,"The postman brings anonymous letters to the police every day, saying her lover is this man, that man."
00:28:54.608,00:28:57.027,The voice of the people is the voice of God.
00:29:30.644,00:29:32.938,I can't talk to anyone about my personal problems.
00:29:33.397,00:29:35.023,They're too intimate.
00:29:35.315,00:29:39.987,But you seem nice. I'd like to confide in you.
00:29:46.618,00:29:52.082,"Every day, I'll light a candle for you. I'll even come to Mass on Sunday."
00:29:52.249,00:29:55.961,But you must protect Malèna Scordia from the town.
00:29:56.795,00:30:00.257,"Yes, the widow. At least for a few years. Then I'll take over."
00:30:22.863,00:30:26.700,Thank you for coming. It's been a pleasure to have you with us.
00:30:27.326,00:30:30.078,"Renewed condolences, Malèna."
00:30:38.295,00:30:40.589,What a piece of ass.
00:30:42.591,00:30:43.925,Son of a bitch!
00:30:47.262,00:30:49.348,You little runt! Come back here!
00:31:06.823,00:31:10.744,-Can't you sing in Italian? -Can't you speak German?
00:33:05.150,00:33:06.735,"Renato, get up. It's late."
00:33:07.486,00:33:10.906,"Renato, get up. Renato!"
00:33:19.539,00:33:25.837,"You're a fetishist, a sadomasochist, or even worse, a pervert!"
00:33:25.962,00:33:28.715,"-What is that? -It's just a French hat, Ma!"
00:33:32.010,00:33:35.889,Shame on you! Shame on you!
00:33:36.056,00:33:39.059,-How pretty. Can I keep them? -You shameless girl!
00:33:39.768,00:33:44.022,What are you looking at? Get out of here!
00:33:47.234,00:33:49.528,-Goddamn pervert! -What did I do?
00:33:50.987,00:33:55.450,"You're not permitted to sit at the table with us, understand?"
00:34:01.706,00:34:05.585,"You no longer have the right to speak to your sisters, understand?"
00:34:09.422,00:34:13.426,You're not to leave this room until further notice!
00:34:14.678,00:34:17.847,"Son, at least have some soup. It will do you good."
00:34:18.598,00:34:21.226,"Pietro, he hasn't eaten for three days."
00:34:21.393,00:34:31.778,"In the Soviet Union, they never eat. Still-- The Fascists gave it to us. At least it looks like coffee."
00:34:31.903,00:34:35.240,"-Sure, and I look like Vittorio De Sica. -Everything they give us is terrible!"
00:34:35.407,00:34:39.619,Look at these pockets. They're always ripping open.
00:34:39.869,00:34:42.539,This cheap thread doesn't hold the stitches.
00:34:42.622,00:34:44.541,The thread isn't the problem.
00:34:44.624,00:34:47.919,"While our son recites poetry, his hands go to work in his pockets!"
00:34:51.423,00:34:53.758,-Do you get it now? -No.
00:34:53.842,00:34:57.095,Just as well! Don't fix them. Sew the pockets closed!
00:34:57.178,00:34:59.556,But he'll have no pockets.
00:34:59.639,00:35:02.309,He'll work it out. It will be good for his health!
00:35:12.444,00:35:15.155,-Has he gone crazy? -I think he's gone blind.
00:35:18.825,00:35:20.702,"Yes, just like that."
00:35:21.620,00:35:32.797,"While upon women's work you sat intent, content with the vague future you held in mind, was the scented May, and thus you used to spend your days."
00:35:32.922,00:35:35.842,-This child needs air. -Air?
00:35:55.153,00:35:57.238,"It says, Urgent."
00:36:03.536,00:36:09.459,UNCLEAR You're dishonored.
00:36:09.542,00:36:34.109,"Your daughter, Malèna, is sleeping with the whole town-- It was an anonymous letter, but I read it!"
00:36:34.234,00:36:36.152,It says Malèna is a whore with everyone in town!
00:36:36.236,00:36:38.071,"So, there's hope for us, too!"
00:36:40.615,00:36:41.658,Take it back!
00:36:41.783,00:36:45.704,"I'll bust your ass, Mr. Short-Pants!"
00:37:30.749,00:37:31.708,"For me, too."
00:37:32.167,00:37:34.711,It's late. I have to get back to the barracks.
00:38:23.760,00:38:27.806,How dare you pester my fiancée!
00:38:48.785,00:38:51.830,I'll break you in two!
00:39:02.674,00:39:05.468,"-Officer, look! He's cheating on me! -With a man?"
00:39:09.180,00:39:11.933,You said you wouldn't touch her with a ten-foot pole!
00:39:13.434,00:39:16.729,"I've been spying on you a long time, you bastard!"
00:39:18.273,00:39:23.236,"And as for you, go steal husbands from your own village, you whore!"
00:39:23.528,00:39:26.072,"We knew she had one lover, but two?"
00:39:26.155,00:39:29.868,But where does the dentist fit in?
00:39:30.076,00:39:31.452,He fits in between her legs!
00:39:31.536,00:39:34.873,Her father was forced to quit the school in disgrace.
00:39:34.956,00:39:37.917,He never wants to see his daughter Malèna again.
00:39:38.084,00:39:41.254,And the dentist's wife kicked him out of his house.
00:39:41.379,00:39:46.676,That dragon of a wife will drag him into court!
00:39:46.759,00:39:50.054,"What's the dentist got to do with it, poor guy?"
00:39:50.221,00:39:53.600,Malèna's the whore! She should be taken to court!
00:39:53.725,00:39:56.519,That Lieutenant Cadei seemed like such a gentleman.
00:39:56.603,00:39:58.730,How could he get mixed up in this?
00:39:59.022,00:40:02.650,Everyone knows she's a home wrecker.
00:40:02.775,00:40:04.819,The lieutenant was asking for it!
00:40:04.903,00:40:08.531,-I think they'll all end up in court. -Are you serious?
00:40:08.615,00:40:10.533,There are three complaints.
00:40:10.617,00:40:13.870,The dentist's wife is suing her husband's lover.
00:40:13.953,00:40:19.083,"The dentist needed three stitches in his head, so he's suing the lieutenant."
00:40:19.208,00:40:22.503,But the dentist swore at the soldier first.
00:40:22.587,00:40:24.172,That's insulting an officer.
00:40:24.297,00:40:26.883,They're all suing each other!
00:40:27.008,00:40:33.097,"While we were watching her caboose, the lieutenant and the dentist were riding the train."
00:41:16.474,00:41:18.142,At your disposal for anything.
00:41:40.456,00:41:44.544,-Can I help you? -May I speak to Lawyer Centorbi?
00:41:49.340,00:41:51.801,"Sir, it's the widow, Scordia."
00:41:51.926,00:41:55.430,Can it be true? Beautiful Madonna.
00:42:06.816,00:42:07.942,Have her come in.
00:42:08.484,00:42:09.902,"You can come in, madam."
00:42:24.667,00:42:27.462,the widow Scordia called Malèna.
00:42:33.718,00:42:35.678,"Everything will be fine, trust me."
00:42:50.026,00:43:00.203,You're accused of involving Dr. Gaspare Cusimano in a secret and amorous relationship aimed at the breaking up of his family.
00:43:00.328,00:43:02.121,Do you know Dr. Cusimano?
00:43:04.499,00:43:05.416,Yes.
00:43:05.541,00:43:09.796,Are you or have you ever been his fiancée?
00:43:10.713,00:43:12.548,Absolutely not.
00:43:13.174,00:43:15.384,How could I be engaged to a married man?
00:43:15.593,00:43:21.099,"Why was Cusimano, at that unusual hour, on his way to your house?"
00:43:21.766,00:43:22.683,I don't know.
00:43:22.934,00:43:26.479,Had he been in your company on previous evenings?
00:43:43.329,00:43:44.413,"Yes, once."
00:43:50.253,00:43:52.713,-Where? -At my house.
00:44:02.598,00:44:05.685,How long did he stay?
00:44:11.315,00:44:13.234,He brought me some medicine for my father.
00:44:15.820,00:44:19.991,"If it was for your father, why did he bring it to you?"
00:44:20.116,00:44:21.159,I don't know.
00:44:22.535,00:44:26.330,What did you do after he gave you the medicine?
00:44:26.455,00:44:28.833,He said goodbye and left.
00:44:33.129,00:44:45.600,"Then why has Cusimano, a reputable professional, who, five years ago, had the honor of extracting one of Il Duce's teeth, publicly declared that he is your fiancé?"
00:44:45.683,00:44:50.104,He made that up. I had nothing to do with it.
00:44:52.190,00:44:56.944,What kind of relationship did you have with Lieutenant Cadei?
00:44:59.739,00:45:01.657,I'm a widow.
00:45:02.283,00:45:06.996,My business and that of Lieutenant Cadei are no concern of the law.
00:45:09.582,00:45:17.173,"All right. Did you know that, as a result of these affairs, Lieutenant Cadei was transferred to Albania?"
00:45:17.256,00:45:18.132,One down.
00:45:22.220,00:45:23.095,Clerk.
00:45:23.179,00:45:44.200,"He declared to have encountered the widow Scordia only twice, in her home, and to have had no amorous relationship, considering their relationship, 'just a casual friendship.' Son of a bitch."
00:45:44.367,00:45:55.753,"Lieutenant Cadei was received by my client, and she makes no secret about having had for him certain feelings."
00:45:55.920,00:46:10.101,"But unlike the married Cusimano, who was, let's face it, guilty of a pre-senile dimming of the senses, of an intoxicating kaleidoscope of desires… What's he saying?"
00:46:10.309,00:46:24.031,"…unlike the family man Cusimano, Cadei is and was… a bachelor! A bachelor!"
00:46:28.536,00:46:42.925,"Careful investigation of the facts tell us, therefore, that the Scordia woman committed no other crime than that of being ill-fated, alone and beautiful."
00:46:43.926,00:46:47.305,"Here is her crime, her beauty!"
00:46:47.388,00:46:57.732,"And from here, the envy, the lies, the disgrace, that have deprived her even of a father's trust."
00:46:58.607,00:47:07.950,"And yet, she herself is still in silent agony, mourning over that unmarked war grave in faraway East Africa."
00:47:09.076,00:47:18.753,"In the beating heart of our argument is an audacious, but nonetheless valid, thesis, which asks just one question."
00:47:19.670,00:47:32.141,"Can a young woman, after the odyssey of a widowhood endured for the love of country, hope for protection in the shelter of a new life?"
00:47:32.266,00:47:39.440,"Does she have the right to yearn for, and to write, a new ending to her own love story?"
00:47:39.690,00:47:45.696,"Your Honor, the citizens of Castelcuto reply, Yes!"
00:47:59.794,00:48:02.505,He's been put into a psychiatric clinic.
00:48:02.880,00:48:06.217,He wants to volunteer for the forces in East Africa.
00:48:06.425,00:48:10.763,He doesn't realize we lost Africa ages ago!
00:48:10.971,00:48:14.433,But let's forget Cusimano and the fickle Lieutenant Cadei.
00:48:20.064,00:48:24.610,Here. One hundred and fifty lire. It's all I have.
00:48:24.777,00:48:27.279,"At the end of the month, I get my pension."
00:48:27.446,00:48:38.874,"Don't you understand? My fee, for that matter, But I could never accept money from you, Malèna."
00:48:59.270,00:49:00.521,Don't do that!
00:49:00.604,00:49:03.107,-If you wanted... -No!
00:49:03.232,00:49:06.235,I am a wealthy man. I'll take care of you.
00:49:27.590,00:49:28.591,I forgive her.
00:49:28.799,00:49:33.596,She did it to pay her lawyer's fee only once and never again.
00:49:33.762,00:49:35.639,But you didn't keep our agreement.
00:49:37.850,00:49:39.268,Now we're even.
00:49:43.981,00:49:49.195,the Sicilian cities that were bombed yesterday by the American planes have been evacuated.

00:50:35.157,00:50:36.492,Now I understand why.
00:50:37.201,00:50:39.828,It's been so long since you last came out of your house.
00:50:40.204,00:50:43.499,"But the longer we are apart, the stronger my love becomes."
00:50:44.166,00:50:48.045,"They say you're about to marry Centorbi, the lawyer."
00:50:48.629,00:50:56.387,"Maybe I'm too much of a little boy as you called me that time you walked by me, as always, without noticing me."
00:50:56.845,00:51:04.436,"But how will you manage to live with a fat, old man, so ugly that no girl ever wanted him?"
00:51:04.895,00:51:08.983,They say he never washes and stinks like a goat.
00:51:09.900,00:51:18.534,"How will your smooth, white skin bear rubbing against the sweat of an old man, who never does anything without his mother's consent?"
00:51:44.852,00:51:46.478,Is it true you're getting married?
00:51:48.022,00:51:52.318,What are you writing? Give me that! Let me see!
00:51:53.861,00:51:57.906,Get out! Get out!
00:51:57.990,00:52:03.537,Shut up! You rascals!
00:52:22.473,00:52:23.349,Yes.
00:52:23.432,00:52:26.352,More room in the waist for when he gets bigger.
00:52:45.788,00:52:48.332,"Lord, help me with my mother, I beg you."
00:52:58.592,00:53:01.845,You can't treat me like a child. I'm a grown man.
00:53:05.432,00:53:09.061,Your father's good name will never belong to that disgusting whore!
00:53:37.673,00:53:39.883,The lawyer was left high and dry!
00:53:40.008,00:53:43.137,His mother still bathes him every Saturday!
00:53:43.262,00:53:46.598,Malèna always has someone throwing a wrench in the works!
00:53:46.724,00:53:50.352,It won't be hard finding someone to replace the lawyer!
00:53:52.563,00:53:56.191,The next in line already has a plan.
00:53:56.358,00:53:58.444,"Yeah, his plan is in his pants."
00:53:59.445,00:54:02.448,"-A cut and shave. -Right away, sir."
00:55:02.925,00:55:06.094,I brought some sugar and flour.
00:55:10.974,00:55:12.100,Better now?
00:55:12.226,00:55:14.686,-I can't pay right now. -That's no problem.
00:55:15.437,00:55:17.898,I'm sure we can find a way to make you some money.
00:56:21.920,00:56:25.173,"All people living in this house were out, I saw them."
00:57:24.566,00:57:25.776,I'm here for you.

01:16:56.028,01:16:57.863,"Hey, kid, what are you doing here? Go away."
01:17:00.241,01:17:02.493,I have to get the coffee cups.
01:17:09.375,01:17:11.127,My parents are dead.
01:17:11.710,01:17:15.714,My wife has disappeared. No one in town knows where she is.
01:17:21.053,01:17:22.263,on the day we arrived here.
01:17:23.264,01:17:25.933,Everybody says she's a prostitute in a whore house.
01:17:36.527,01:17:56.005,HOSPITAL Excuse me. Don't you remember me? I'm Nino Scordia.
01:17:56.463,01:17:58.924,You mistake me for someone else.
01:17:59.008,01:18:00.259,Could I have a light?
01:18:00.342,01:18:03.470,"You were the Fascist secretary, and you were his deputy."
01:18:03.554,01:18:04.555,You can help me.
01:18:04.930,01:18:06.473,Do you know what happened to my wife?
01:18:06.599,01:18:09.143,Didn't she join the Communist Party?
01:18:10.519,01:18:15.024,She was photographed with her arms around the commie leader.
01:18:17.484,01:18:19.195,You're a family of heroes!
01:18:19.278,01:18:23.449,UNCLEAR You're right.
01:18:24.200,01:18:28.078,Those who fought the war for you bastards aren't heroes.
01:18:29.788,01:18:32.541,Go take a walk through the brothels of Sicily.
01:18:33.042,01:18:36.212,You may find your wife there!
01:19:48.993,01:19:52.329,forgive me if I don't have the courage to speak man-to-man.
01:19:53.122,01:19:57.751,But I can't find any other way to let you know that I'm the only one who knows the truth about your wife.
01:19:58.627,01:20:01.338,Don't feel sad if nobody wants to talk to you.
01:20:01.547,01:20:05.509,"It's better this way. Around here, they only say bad things about her."
01:20:05.968,01:20:09.805,"But believe me, your wife Malèna was faithful to you."
01:20:09.930,01:20:13.559,You are the only man she loved. This is the honest truth.
01:20:14.310,01:20:19.898,"It is true, a lot of things happened, but back then, you had been dead a long time."
01:20:20.649,01:20:23.736,"The last time I saw her, she was on a train for Messina."
01:20:23.861,01:20:25.112,Best of luck.
01:20:25.404,01:20:31.493,"I should sign a friend, like all anonymous letters, but my name is Renato."
01:21:11.200,01:21:13.577,"Good morning, judge."
01:21:16.038,01:21:17.498,"All is well, thank God."
01:21:17.956,01:21:20.918,"Eat up, my sweet pea."
01:21:29.968,01:21:31.011,Good morning.
01:21:36.183,01:21:39.269,"Look who's here. Nino, look who's here."
01:22:41.540,01:22:45.544,-Why are you all looking at that woman? -It's nothing.
01:23:13.614,01:23:17.159,I saw them in the square. They were walking arm in arm.
01:23:17.284,01:23:18.911,Quiet. She's here!
01:23:24.082,01:23:25.792,Look who's here.
01:23:35.969,01:23:40.057,"-She's got some wrinkles around her eyes. -She's put on weight, too."
01:23:43.018,01:23:44.102,But she's still beautiful.
01:23:45.020,01:23:46.939,"Good morning, Mrs. Scordia."
01:24:02.996,01:24:04.122,Good morning.
01:24:05.541,01:24:07.125,-Good morning. -Good morning.
01:24:08.335,01:24:11.421,Want some nice tomatoes? They cost less over there.
01:24:11.672,01:24:12.589,Thank you.
01:24:13.799,01:24:14.758,Good morning.
01:24:15.467,01:24:17.135,Nice things here.
01:24:18.345,01:24:21.056,"-Like it, Signora Malèna? -Yes."
01:24:21.223,01:24:23.350,"-Try it on. -No, that's okay."
01:24:23.600,01:24:26.019,-It's no problem. -Another time.
01:24:26.436,01:24:28.146,Give me your bag.
01:24:28.605,01:24:31.525,-We'll discuss it later. -Thank you.
01:24:34.736,01:24:36.488,"Good morning, Signora Malèna."
01:25:33.253,01:25:34.379,It's okay. I'll get it.
01:25:39.468,01:25:40.510,Thank you.
01:25:43.930,01:25:45.015,Thank you for your help.
01:26:21.927,01:26:23.720,I pedaled away as if I was escaping.
01:26:24.137,01:26:29.476,"And I was from her, from those emotions, from dreams, from memories, from everything."
01:26:29.851,01:26:31.978,And I thought that I needed to forget.
01:26:32.979,01:26:35.857,I was certain that I would be able to forget.
01:26:36.274,01:26:51.498,"But now that I'm old, that I've lived a trite life, and that I've met so many women that said, Remember me, and I've forgotten them all, still today, she's the one… the only one I've never forgotten."
01:26:52.249,01:26:53.291,Malèna.
