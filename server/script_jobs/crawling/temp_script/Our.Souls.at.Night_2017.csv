00:01:40.433,00:01:42.060,Mike and I will be eating corn dogs.
00:01:42.143,00:01:44.270,"Mike says that's his favorite. Rob, what's yours?"
00:02:13.842,00:02:17.971,"And, uh, you know, for the most part, they're not dumping a lot of rain at this point."
00:02:18.054,00:02:23.768,"They actually have some movement to them, so not very stationary, staying on point, I should say."
00:02:23.852,00:02:28.231,"So, as we go through the hour-by-hour here, maybe around midnight tonight-- we're gonna stop this here."
00:02:32.652,00:02:35.738,"-Hello, Louis. -Hello, Mrs. Moore."
00:02:36.322,00:02:37.157,Addie.
00:02:41.411,00:02:43.454,Can I talk to you about something?
00:02:43.538,00:02:44.372,Sure.
00:02:46.457,00:02:48.418,"-May I come in? -Oh, oh, yeah, sure."
00:02:51.296,00:02:54.549,This is the next storm system moving into the Pacific Northwest.
00:02:54.632,00:02:59.262,This will come in our direction over the next two days and really clear everything on out of here.
00:02:59.345,00:03:02.390,"So the highs today, we only saw the lower 70s today."
00:03:02.473,00:03:03.558,"Tomorrow, much the same."
00:03:03.641,00:03:07.854,"We're gonna be embedded in a lot of cloud cover, maybe a few streaks of sun here and there."
00:03:07.937,00:03:10.481,"But by Saturday, watch this."
00:03:12.233,00:03:17.322,"...by the time we get into Sunday because that system comes right through, -dries us out... -Oh, oh! I'm so sorry."
00:03:26.956,00:03:28.750,I want to suggest something to you.
00:03:28.833,00:03:31.794,It's a... proposal of sorts.
00:03:32.879,00:03:34.088,Not marriage.
00:03:36.925,00:03:41.137,"It is a kind of marriage-like question, actually, but, um..."
00:03:47.977,00:03:51.522,Would you be interested in coming to my house sometime to sleep with me?
00:03:58.029,00:03:59.072,See...
00:03:59.864,00:04:00.865,we're both alone.
00:04:01.783,00:04:05.912,"You know, we've been on our own for... for years."
00:04:05.995,00:04:06.913,"And, uh..."
00:04:10.416,00:04:13.962,"I'm lonely, and I'm guessing you might be, too."
00:04:17.757,00:04:19.592,"Louis, it's not about sex."
00:04:23.179,00:04:25.807,I lost interest in that a long time ago.
00:04:26.766,00:04:27.684,"No, it's, um..."
00:04:30.561,00:04:32.814,"It's about getting through the night, you know?"
00:04:34.023,00:04:34.857,About...
00:04:35.858,00:04:42.156,"lying down in bed together and-- and talking through the night until we fall asleep, that kind of thing."
00:04:45.618,00:04:47.328,"Nights are the worst, don't you think?"
00:04:54.669,00:04:56.421,"you know, someone nice."
00:05:01.467,00:05:03.594,-I don't know. -Is it...
00:05:03.678,00:05:05.972,Would that be something of interest to you?
00:05:15.732,00:05:16.941,Can I think about it?
00:05:26.242,00:05:29.037,"I'll-- I'll call you, okay? I'll give you a call."
00:05:29.120,00:05:31.456,I'm sure Diane had your number here somewhere.
00:05:36.252,00:05:38.504,"-Thank you for your time. -No, thank you."
00:05:41.215,00:05:44.260,"Oh, here. Stupid door. Here, let me get that."
00:05:48.848,00:05:49.682,Thank you.
00:06:25.843,00:06:31.057,"And if he drinks half as much as I hear he does, then I am glad he lost his job."
00:06:35.436,00:06:37.605,-And his dad... -I remember him.
00:06:37.688,00:06:40.108,His dad was just exactly like him.
00:06:40.191,00:06:47.115,He used to paint that old kind of jalopy car all those ridiculous colors and just for attention.
00:06:47.198,00:06:51.577,And then he had the guts to drive that piece of crap around town...
00:06:59.961,00:07:02.046,they knew what cocktail hour was.
00:07:23.776,00:07:24.610,Hello?
00:07:29.157,00:07:30.575,This is Louis Waters.
00:07:35.163,00:07:39.667,"So, uh, I've been thinking about what you suggested, and I think I'd like to try it."
00:07:47.467,00:07:49.719,"Well, uh, when-- when were you thinking?"
00:07:51.387,00:07:52.221,Tomorrow night?
00:08:00.062,00:08:00.897,Nine?
00:09:30.194,00:09:31.529,What are you doing back here?
00:09:32.280,00:09:35.616,"Well, I wasn't sure if-- You know how it is. People talk."
00:09:47.503,00:09:48.671,Um...
00:09:50.298,00:09:51.799,How about a drink?
00:09:52.216,00:09:53.509,Sounds like a good idea.
00:09:54.885,00:09:55.845,Red okay?
00:09:58.556,00:09:59.640,Do you have any beer?
00:10:00.850,00:10:02.476,I'll get some beer for you next time.
00:10:05.062,00:10:07.231,"What, you don't think there's going to be a next time?"
00:10:07.815,00:10:09.984,"Oh, no, no. It's not that. It's just..."
00:10:10.067,00:10:12.445,Wait a minute. How long have we known each other?
00:10:12.778,00:10:14.155,How long have we been neighbors?
00:10:18.326,00:10:21.120,-We don't really know each other. -Well...
00:10:25.333,00:10:27.418,How about we get to know each other?
00:10:31.964,00:10:34.300,"Go ahead, ask me a question. Anything."
00:10:36.802,00:10:38.804,"Pretty cold for spring, huh?"
00:10:41.515,00:10:43.517,We're gonna talk about the weather?
00:10:48.022,00:10:49.940,Literally anything else.
00:10:51.275,00:10:53.152,I'm not much of a talker these days.
00:10:54.278,00:10:55.780,"Well, that's disappointing."
00:11:15.466,00:11:19.428,-Would you like a tour of the house? -What-- Yeah.
00:11:25.142,00:11:26.310,This is the living room.
00:11:33.067,00:11:34.110,"-And, uh... -Oh."
00:11:34.193,00:11:36.362,"Bigger house than I thought, more rooms."
00:11:37.238,00:11:39.031,It's been a good house for us.
00:11:39.115,00:11:40.533,How long have you lived here?
00:11:43.119,00:11:45.913,-48 years. -48 years?
00:11:46.247,00:11:47.623,That's a long time.
00:11:50.418,00:11:52.461,Would you like to see the upstairs?
00:11:55.381,00:11:56.215,Okay.
00:12:07.518,00:12:11.355,So this was Connie's room.
00:12:11.439,00:12:13.816,And this was Gene's room.
00:12:17.278,00:12:18.863,And the bathroom.
00:12:20.531,00:12:21.365,"And, um..."
00:12:23.242,00:12:24.785,This is where we always slept.
00:12:29.123,00:12:30.583,"Oh, I know what you mean."
00:12:39.842,00:12:41.051,You getting in?
00:12:42.052,00:12:42.887,Yeah.
00:13:02.364,00:13:05.075,I was just thinking how strange this all seems.
00:13:11.749,00:13:13.584,Maybe it wasn't such a good idea?
00:13:18.589,00:13:21.217,Maybe... Maybe it could be.
00:13:25.012,00:13:25.846,Yeah.
00:13:27.848,00:13:29.517,"Yeah, maybe it is."
00:14:01.465,00:14:03.259,You know what else I was thinking?
00:14:10.432,00:14:11.767,Are you still awake?
00:15:15.581,00:15:18.000,and this model brings in some redevelopment late tonight.
00:15:18.083,00:15:23.339,"This is 11 o'clock across El Paso County back into Teller County, still another round of shower activity possible."
00:15:23.422,00:15:26.884,"Overnight tonight, light rain possible across parts of the viewing area."
00:15:26.967,00:15:31.430,"Nothing intense, just a few raindrops on the rooftops, even for the drive early tomorrow morning."
00:15:31.513,00:15:34.516,Light showers certainly possible by 8:30 to nine.
00:15:34.600,00:15:36.810,Even a couple of sprinkles in some areas.
00:15:36.894,00:15:40.064,We're going to see dry conditions and some sunshine during the midday hours.
00:15:40.147,00:15:44.777,"That'll help destabilize the atmosphere, so thunderstorms will develop again tomorrow afternoon..."
00:16:04.296,00:16:06.215,I wasn't sure if you'd come back.
00:16:06.298,00:16:07.132,Why not?
00:16:08.467,00:16:09.677,I don't know.
00:16:11.762,00:16:14.348,You didn't leave your pajamas here last time.
00:16:15.182,00:16:16.100,I didn't...
00:16:16.183,00:16:18.185,I didn't want to seem presumptuous.
00:16:18.602,00:16:20.604,It might be easier if you left a few things here.
00:16:21.438,00:16:23.649,"Well, then you wouldn't have to carry them."
00:16:33.701,00:16:35.285,So... why me?
00:16:38.330,00:16:40.290,"Well, no, just curious. I just wondered."
00:16:41.792,00:16:44.086,I always thought you were someone I could talk to.
00:16:45.921,00:16:56.765,"And you're a lot better-looking -You know, the truth is... -Hmm?"
00:16:59.852,00:17:01.895,I always thought you were a good man.
00:17:02.479,00:17:03.313,-You did? -Mm-hmm.
00:17:05.399,00:17:08.360,"So how have you thought of me, if you ever have?"
00:17:09.445,00:17:11.739,Oh. I've thought of you.
00:17:20.247,00:17:23.083,"But a person of substance, of character."
00:17:23.792,00:17:25.294,Whatever gave you that impression?
00:17:26.420,00:17:30.257,"Because the way you lived your life, the way you managed your life after Carl died."
00:17:31.759,00:17:37.389,"I knew the way it was with Diane and me, and it seemed to me you were doing a lot better than I was."
00:17:37.473,00:17:38.766,And I-- I admired that.
00:17:38.849,00:17:43.145,But you never came over or made a point of talking to me.
00:17:45.606,00:17:47.649,"-I mean... -Yeah, intrusive."
00:17:54.615,00:17:56.200,"You know, I think..."
00:17:58.702,00:18:01.080,that you should come through the front door next time.
00:18:01.163,00:18:04.333,"-Well, like I said, people talk. -Oh, let them talk."
00:18:06.835,00:18:12.174,"You know, I've spent my whole life worrying about what people think."
00:18:17.054,00:18:19.807,"So, uh, what else do you want to know?"
00:18:21.475,00:18:22.851,"Well, I have some questions."
00:18:22.935,00:18:24.394,"Yeah, such as?"
00:18:25.187,00:18:30.234,"Well, where you're from, what you were like as a little girl, how you met Carl, who your friends are."
00:18:32.194,00:18:33.529,I could-- You know?
00:18:33.612,00:18:35.739,"What you believe in, what party you vote for."
00:19:04.977,00:19:07.479,I called three times last night. You didn't answer.
00:19:09.690,00:19:10.774,"Oh, um..."
00:19:14.528,00:19:16.321,"I guess I just didn't hear the phone, Holly."
00:19:25.372,00:19:26.206,What?
00:19:38.135,00:19:40.512,So what else is going on? What are you up to?
00:19:44.266,00:19:45.934,"Uh, not much."
00:20:57.214,00:20:58.924,Tell me about the other woman.
00:21:07.015,00:21:09.893,"Her name was Tamara, still is if she's alive."
00:21:12.229,00:21:15.107,"-She was a teacher, too, right? -Uh-huh."
00:21:15.190,00:21:20.988,"Yeah. You know, I saw her once or twice in the parking lot when I went to pick Gene up from school."
00:21:21.738,00:21:24.574,"She was tall, exotic."
00:21:25.450,00:21:27.202,"-Native American, right? -Yeah."
00:21:34.793,00:21:40.382,"She was married to a salesman, um, and they had a daughter, about the same age as Holly."
00:21:42.509,00:21:46.346,"Well, at that time, Diane and I, we really weren't doing so well."
00:21:46.430,00:21:47.264,Why not?
00:21:51.560,00:21:52.602,"Well, because of me."
00:21:55.689,00:21:57.024,"And a little bit her, too."
00:21:58.317,00:22:06.533,"You know, Holly was little, and neither one of us really, really knew what we were doing, and we would have these arguments that would turn into fights, and then..."
00:22:06.867,00:22:11.038,and then she'd start crying and leave the room before we could finish what we were fighting about.
00:22:11.121,00:22:14.875,"And so, at school, one of you made some move, some gesture or..."
00:22:16.335,00:22:19.004,"Yeah, one day I was in the lounge, and she walked in, and..."
00:22:20.130,00:22:24.634,"she walked up to me and just put her hand on my arm, just the tiniest, tiniest gesture."
00:22:25.093,00:22:27.637,And I remember it was tax time. It was the middle of April.
00:22:27.721,00:22:37.147,"And I was doing our taxes, and I went to mail them that night, and as I went by her house, for no good reason, she looked up and saw me through the window."
00:22:37.230,00:22:38.398,And that's how it started?
00:22:38.857,00:22:41.568,"On Tax Day. Strange, isn't it?"
00:22:43.111,00:22:45.781,"Well, these things happen in all kinds of ways."
00:22:48.825,00:22:54.831,"And then, I left Diane and Holly and I moved in with Tamara and her daughter, and her husband moved out."
00:22:57.125,00:22:57.959,And then?
00:23:00.670,00:23:03.298,"Well, we got along for a couple of weeks. I mean..."
00:23:06.927,00:23:08.095,"God, she was beautiful."
00:23:08.178,00:23:12.349,And she had... the most beautiful brown eyes and skin like satin.
00:23:12.432,00:23:13.934,-And she was-- -How did it end?
00:23:14.017,00:23:15.811,-Huh? -How did it end?
00:23:16.895,00:23:23.235,"I was having supper, me, Tamara and her daughter, and I suddenly got sick of myself."
00:23:24.653,00:23:26.279,"I thought, What am I doing?"
00:23:26.363,00:23:31.701,"I'm trying to play a father to Tamara's daughter, and my daughter is growing up without me."
00:23:31.785,00:23:32.619,So...
00:23:34.329,00:23:35.247,How'd she take it?
00:23:35.664,00:23:36.665,She cried.
00:23:38.667,00:23:39.709,And...
00:23:40.710,00:23:42.921,"she said, Is this our last night?"
00:23:45.090,00:23:47.676,"I remember that night, how-- how it was."
00:23:48.760,00:23:50.345,You never talked to her again?
00:23:50.428,00:23:51.263,No.
00:23:55.684,00:23:57.435,I think you're still in love with her.
00:23:58.436,00:24:01.148,"-No, I'm not. -Yeah, well, it sounds like it."
00:24:03.233,00:24:07.946,"Maybe a little bit with the memory of her, but that's-- that's different."
00:24:12.242,00:24:13.493,"Come on, get in bed."
00:24:14.077,00:24:14.953,Yeah.
00:24:40.979,00:24:45.650,"You know, I think I regret hurting Tamara more than I regret hurting my own wife."
00:24:46.234,00:24:49.404,It's like I failed my spirit or something.
00:24:52.032,00:24:55.785,Or I missed a special kind of call to be something more.
00:24:56.828,00:24:59.956,"Oh, don't be so hard on yourself, Louis."
00:25:00.040,00:25:01.583,You did the right thing.
00:25:02.626,00:25:04.127,You're a good man.
00:25:04.544,00:25:07.797,I... I don't know about that.
00:25:08.798,00:25:12.177,You were a good teacher to Gene. I remember.
00:25:14.638,00:25:18.016,"A good one, maybe, but not a great one."
00:25:19.351,00:25:20.352,I know that.
00:25:22.979,00:25:26.566,"...like he's your buddy, and he knows you know something he don't know."
00:25:26.650,00:25:30.195,"He knows every goddamn thing you know, trust me, bud, we all do."
00:25:34.407,00:25:36.451,"-How you doing, Louis? -Oh, good enough."
00:25:36.534,00:25:38.119,"-All right. -Good morning, sir."
00:25:38.203,00:25:40.830,"-You look great, Louis. -Oh, thanks."
00:25:40.914,00:25:43.500,"-You get a good night's sleep? -Yeah, how about you?"
00:25:43.583,00:25:47.337,"-Ah, tossing and turning, you know. -Oh, sorry to hear that."
00:25:50.924,00:25:54.844,"Yeah, we've heard you've been pretty busy, for sure."
00:25:56.471,00:25:59.349,"-Oh, yeah? -Yeah. Well, that's the word anyway."
00:25:59.432,00:26:01.351,How's the bad back?
00:26:01.434,00:26:04.396,"Uh, it's still a bit sore, but it's okay, I guess."
00:26:10.777,00:26:11.611,How's that?
00:26:17.867,00:26:19.202,on your energy.
00:26:22.706,00:26:24.749,We all wish we had your energy.
00:26:30.297,00:26:32.632,"Well, it's been... it's been fun."
00:26:32.716,00:26:34.426,"-Oh, come on. -Where you going?"
00:26:34.509,00:26:36.720,"Sit down, Louis. We're just getting started."
00:26:36.803,00:26:37.929,Finish your coffee.
00:26:40.181,00:26:41.975,-Come on! -Where you going?
00:26:42.058,00:26:44.811,"-No need to rush off. -Come on, it's just us!"
00:26:45.937,00:26:47.814,You got a whole day to mope.
00:26:58.033,00:26:59.409,Are you all right?
00:27:01.369,00:27:02.203,Yeah.
00:27:07.292,00:27:08.126,You sure?
00:27:13.298,00:27:16.551,"-Oh, let me get it. -No, thanks."
00:27:32.525,00:27:34.736,You gonna need to get some groceries after?
00:27:36.946,00:27:39.574,It's not like I have anyone else to cook for.
00:27:57.092,00:27:58.551,"I was gonna tell you, you know."
00:28:03.681,00:28:06.017,I see him leave sometimes in the morning.
00:28:07.727,00:28:09.104,"Guess others do, too."
00:28:14.776,00:28:16.111,It's not what you think.
00:28:17.779,00:28:19.697,-It's not? -No.
00:28:23.535,00:28:25.703,"Well, in that case, I'm insulted."
00:28:25.787,00:28:28.206,"Not even dead yet, and you're already replacing me."
00:28:41.511,00:28:42.762,What do you think of him?
00:28:44.180,00:28:45.640,He seems all right.
00:28:47.767,00:28:50.103,Mows my lawn from time to time.
00:28:52.063,00:28:54.232,Shovels the walk when it snows.
00:28:55.608,00:28:59.237,"Well, that's nice. Huh?"
00:29:01.823,00:29:02.949,But he's no saint.
00:29:04.576,00:29:07.954,I could tell you about that. His wife could've told you.
00:29:08.037,00:29:09.664,"Oh, that won't be necessary."
00:29:13.209,00:29:14.544,We all have history.
00:29:15.545,00:29:17.589,"That we do, that we do."
00:29:53.166,00:29:54.459,You know Dorlan Becker?
00:29:55.585,00:29:57.629,"Bald guy, used to own the men's store."
00:29:57.712,00:29:58.922,-Why? -Yeah.
00:29:59.589,00:30:01.299,"Yeah, he's-- he's, um..."
00:30:02.467,00:30:05.386,"He's one of the guys I meet with, uh, down at the coffee shop."
00:30:09.265,00:30:12.060,"Well, anyway, he wanted to know how come I had so much energy."
00:30:14.270,00:30:17.232,I said he wanted to know how come I had so much energy.
00:30:19.984,00:30:21.319,What'd you tell him?
00:30:21.986,00:30:23.321,"Well, I-- I got mad."
00:30:24.739,00:30:27.867,"I don't think I handled it very well. In fact, I think I'm still mad."
00:30:38.002,00:30:41.089,"So, Louis, what's the problem?"
00:30:41.172,00:30:43.716,"Well, I don't want anybody to think anything bad."
00:30:43.800,00:30:45.176,-Anything bad? -Yeah.
00:30:45.260,00:30:47.053,-Like what? -About you or about us.
00:30:49.556,00:30:50.890,"Let it go, Louis."
00:30:51.850,00:30:53.726,We always knew people would find out.
00:30:55.228,00:30:56.479,Who cares?
00:31:03.027,00:31:04.696,Are you over it yet?
00:31:56.039,00:31:57.540,So I've been thinking.
00:31:59.542,00:32:00.627,I've got this idea.
00:32:01.252,00:32:02.211,I'm listening.
00:32:02.295,00:32:04.422,"Why don't we go into town, have lunch..."
00:32:05.548,00:32:07.342,just take our time and enjoy ourselves?
00:32:08.259,00:32:10.553,-In public? -Yeah.
00:32:16.017,00:32:17.352,When do you want to do it?
00:32:18.937,00:32:21.022,Sunday. About noon?
00:32:22.065,00:32:23.399,Sounds fine to me.
00:32:26.945,00:32:29.030,Maybe I'll wear something bright and flashy.
00:32:55.139,00:32:57.183,"-Hi, Charlie. -Louis, how are you?"
00:32:57.266,00:32:59.394,-Okay. -Sir.
00:33:02.981,00:33:04.774,Your server will be right with you.
00:33:16.452,00:33:19.330,Doesn't seem too revolutionary so far.
00:33:45.857,00:33:49.819,And Connie had the hose on with one of those-- Remember those old-fashioned sprinkler heads?
00:33:49.902,00:33:53.906,"-Yeah, right. -That the kids could jump through the spray, you know, and..."
00:33:56.200,00:33:58.453,Gene was five at the time. Connie was 11.
00:33:59.954,00:34:07.086,"And he was chasing her around the yard with the hose, and they were laughing and screaming and..."
00:34:12.091,00:34:14.927,And I went inside to check on dinner.
00:34:16.596,00:34:18.765,I was making tomato soup.
00:34:21.809,00:34:30.193,"And I heard the screech of car tires and, uh, a thud and a scream, and I ran outside and..."
00:34:38.534,00:34:42.538,"Uh, the driver was standing next to his car, and he kept saying, Oh, God. Oh, God."
00:34:42.622,00:34:43.998,It was...
00:34:46.959,00:34:51.047,"I don't know who called the ambulance, but it got there pretty quick."
00:34:58.805,00:35:00.264,She was still alive.
00:35:02.725,00:35:04.018,My little girl.
00:35:08.481,00:35:12.276,"And we rode to the hospital, and I held her head in my lap."
00:35:18.574,00:35:20.618,"Two days later, she was buried."
00:35:22.411,00:35:24.372,Her body was buried.
00:35:24.455,00:35:26.833,And I don't remember anything else about that time.
00:35:26.916,00:35:29.502,I don't remember Gene going back to school.
00:35:29.585,00:35:32.213,I don't remember Carl going back to work.
00:35:36.467,00:35:38.845,But things were never the same between us.
00:35:40.847,00:35:44.767,"Never. Our relationship, our marriage..."
00:35:44.851,00:35:46.644,In what way?
00:35:48.479,00:35:50.940,Just in every way possible. It was...
00:35:52.525,00:35:54.235,I don't know. We stopped talking.
00:35:55.069,00:35:56.779,We stopped being intimate.
00:35:57.446,00:36:00.074,It's tough for a marriage to survive that.
00:36:02.368,00:36:05.121,"You know, you wake up one morning, and you have everything."
00:36:05.204,00:36:06.873,Then the next morning it's all gone.
00:36:08.457,00:36:13.838,"That's how fast it can happen, just like that, in an instant, you know?"
00:36:47.330,00:36:51.000,"-You two aren't fighting again... -No, Mom, come on."
00:36:55.713,00:36:59.842,"She can't keep doing this, Gene. It's not right."
00:36:59.926,00:37:01.510,-Mom-- -And it's not good for him.
00:37:02.220,00:37:05.431,"Mom, it's not what you think it is. We don't have a problem, okay?"
00:37:05.514,00:37:08.643,"Just-- Just take him for a couple of days, that's all I'm asking. Help me out."
00:37:10.811,00:37:11.896,Take him?
00:37:11.979,00:37:15.107,"Yeah, until Bev comes back or he goes back to school in September."
00:37:17.652,00:37:19.987,"She's not gonna just go and leave her son, is she?"
00:37:26.827,00:37:28.746,Of course I'll take him.
00:37:34.210,00:37:35.378,How's your shop?
00:37:37.380,00:37:38.839,It was wonderful. I lost it.
00:37:43.094,00:37:47.431,"You know, nobody's buying unpainted furniture nowadays, and-- and I can't help it, you know?"
00:37:48.474,00:37:51.602,Yeah. So what are you gonna do?
00:37:55.523,00:37:56.983,Uh...
00:37:57.066,00:37:58.567,"I'll, uh-- I'll figure it out."
00:38:02.154,00:38:03.531,You need money?
00:38:09.954,00:38:10.788,No.
00:38:22.383,00:38:23.926,"You're gonna be all right, okay?"
00:38:26.679,00:38:28.014,"All right, now go inside."
00:38:28.681,00:38:30.308,"She's waiting for you, come on."
00:38:46.782,00:38:48.242,"Come on, go inside."
00:38:51.620,00:38:53.831,"Go on. Jamie, go up."
00:38:55.249,00:38:57.043,"Come on, we're gonna have a good time."
00:39:05.509,00:39:07.219,"Well, it-- it doesn't have to be."
00:39:09.597,00:39:11.390,I don't know. Let's see how it goes.
00:39:18.105,00:39:21.192,Been quite a stretch since I took care of a seven-year-old.
00:39:21.525,00:39:23.986,"Yeah, you and me both."
00:39:46.509,00:39:48.094,How are things at home?
00:39:48.803,00:39:49.637,Uh...
00:39:51.722,00:39:55.309,"Well, we're gonna have a good time, you and me, okay?"
00:39:56.143,00:39:58.020,"Okay, so let's go to bed now."
00:39:59.021,00:40:00.731,-Nana? -Yeah?
00:40:00.815,00:40:02.483,Can I sleep in your room?
00:40:05.820,00:40:07.113,Sure.
00:40:17.581,00:40:19.125,Pretty good cupcakes.
00:40:35.808,00:40:37.935,"Hey, Jamie, how do you like school?"
00:40:48.112,00:40:50.448,What's that game you're playing on your phone?
00:40:50.531,00:40:52.783,-It's called Clash of Clans. -It's called what?
00:40:52.867,00:40:55.369,-Clash of Clans. -Clash of Clans.
00:40:56.871,00:41:01.542,"-How's it work? -You build a city and then, like, -watch it grow and stuff. -Huh."
00:41:08.174,00:41:12.178,"Hey, you want to see something cool?"
00:41:15.514,00:41:16.474,Hello?
00:41:19.310,00:41:20.144,What?
00:41:22.646,00:41:23.564,I'll show you.
00:41:25.316,00:41:27.193,"See, I think..."
00:41:31.071,00:41:32.406,I...
00:41:33.240,00:41:34.074,Yep.
00:41:39.955,00:41:40.998,Here it is.
00:41:42.791,00:41:46.462,This is the engine that pulls the rest of the train.
00:41:48.464,00:41:49.298,And...
00:41:50.549,00:41:53.761,"Oh, and this is the freight car. It comes right behind it."
00:41:56.805,00:41:59.433,"And this is the caboose, which comes at the end."
00:42:01.810,00:42:03.896,-Where'd you buy them? -Hmm?
00:42:03.979,00:42:05.481,Where'd you buy them?
00:42:05.564,00:42:09.151,"Uh, I got them from a mail order, got them from mail order..."
00:42:11.779,00:42:14.823,And it was coming-- It was a big box with instructions in it.
00:42:14.907,00:42:17.451,And it came all the way from Tennessee.
00:42:18.244,00:42:24.708,"And then my daughter and I put this thing together, and, boy, it took weeks to build it."
00:42:27.461,00:42:28.963,Can I play with them?
00:42:32.216,00:42:33.634,If you're careful.
00:42:34.510,00:42:41.100,"I put bad guys on the train, and they were, like, robbing the train, and then I had good guys, like, come out and push them off the train."
00:42:41.183,00:42:46.230,And then I used paper towels-- I stuffed paper towels on the train to make it look like smoke.
00:42:47.523,00:42:49.650,"Oh, that sounds like a fun day."
00:42:52.736,00:42:54.113,"Oh, can I play with my phone now?"
00:42:57.199,00:42:58.659,For a half hour.
00:43:00.119,00:43:01.495,Not at the table.
00:43:03.497,00:43:05.082,Ask to be excused.
00:43:05.165,00:43:07.501,-May I please be excused? -Yes. Oh.
00:43:11.130,00:43:12.506,Baby steps.
00:43:19.221,00:43:21.056,Where-- Where's Addie?
00:43:21.140,00:43:24.977,She said I could come by myself. Are you bringing the train set out today?
00:43:25.894,00:43:30.566,"Well, I guess I could-- I could poss-- Okay, then."
00:43:35.070,00:43:36.739,-Okay? -Got it.
00:43:36.822,00:43:40.826,"Now, you're gonna hook these up, and then..."
00:43:41.368,00:43:43.454,"-Careful, easy. -Wait."
00:43:43.537,00:43:45.914,-There you go. -Connected.
00:43:47.916,00:43:52.171,"You know, when I was a kid, they'd try to sell you cereal to eat."
00:43:52.254,00:43:57.384,"-Mm-hmm. -And so what they'd do, they'd put a prize at the bottom of the cereal box, a little prize, like a ring?"
00:43:57.468,00:43:59.637,Like a Captain Midnight ring or something like that.
00:44:00.638,00:44:03.849,And you'd plow through the cereal to get to the prize.
00:44:03.932,00:44:08.896,"You didn't like the cereal, 'cause it wasn't very good anyway, but you couldn't wait to get the prize, then you got your ring."
00:44:09.480,00:44:10.773,"Okay, now, what's next?"
00:44:11.148,00:44:14.234,Pulling the train along. And go.
00:44:14.318,00:44:17.112,Don't you think the train needs to go through a town?
00:44:17.196,00:44:18.989,"-Well, yeah. -See, here's the town."
00:44:19.073,00:44:20.491,-Cool. -Okay.
00:44:20.574,00:44:23.327,"Wow. Oh, wow, this is a big house."
00:44:23.410,00:44:25.788,"Well, somebody's got-- Ooh, somebody's very rich."
00:44:25.871,00:44:28.624,"-Oh, how about a church? -Oh, yeah, you've got to have a church."
00:44:28.707,00:44:30.959,"Yeah, what's a town without a church?"
00:44:36.548,00:44:38.133,Now you're talking.
00:44:39.760,00:44:43.389,"You know, my mom was five when they first put the streetlights in Holt."
00:44:45.015,00:44:47.226,There were many more flowers on Main Street then.
00:44:49.103,00:44:50.396,Where'd they go?
00:44:51.605,00:44:53.107,"Well, 'cause of the moths."
00:44:53.190,00:44:58.153,"The moths would pollinate the flowers, and then because of the lights, they would go higher up, away from the flowers."
00:44:59.071,00:45:03.075,"So why don't they make the lights lower, like at my height?"
00:45:03.158,00:45:04.410,I don't know.
00:45:05.494,00:45:06.995,That's an idea.
00:45:14.461,00:45:16.171,Will you wash up for dinner?
00:45:17.005,00:45:17.881,-Okay. -Okay.
00:45:17.965,00:45:21.468,"-Can I have a sleepover? -Yeah, sure."
00:45:22.052,00:45:23.137,"With Louis, too?"
00:45:36.775,00:45:38.235,Out like a light.
00:46:05.762,00:46:07.973,Okay. Come here.
00:46:09.600,00:46:11.226,Don't forget Mister Monkey.
00:46:12.102,00:46:14.813,"Here you go. Okay, here we go."
00:46:16.982,00:46:18.233,What are you doing?
00:46:22.488,00:46:24.490,"Stay. Come on, get in."
00:46:39.296,00:46:43.717,"-I'm gonna turn the light off, all right? -Okay."
00:46:55.646,00:46:57.898,"Look, I'll hold your hand, okay?"
00:47:50.534,00:47:55.038,"We're down a run, but the top of the order is coming up, and that's where the best hitters are."
00:47:58.625,00:47:59.543,You ever seen a game?
00:48:01.003,00:48:02.170,You haven't? You ever play?
00:48:15.809,00:48:17.269,She is so good.
00:48:17.352,00:48:19.688,"-She's good, yeah. -She just always has been."
00:48:21.148,00:48:21.982,So...
00:48:24.860,00:48:26.903,Does he still come by at night?
00:48:29.656,00:48:32.117,"We don't do anything, if that's what you're thinking."
00:48:41.376,00:48:42.711,The hell you waiting for?
00:48:45.172,00:48:46.798,The hell you waiting for?
00:48:46.882,00:48:49.968,"-I'm just rattling you. -No, it's not what it's about."
00:48:55.682,00:48:57.893,than wanting to chase something and catch it.
00:49:04.691,00:49:06.943,it breaks my heart to see how lonely he is.
00:49:10.989,00:49:11.907,You know what he needs?
00:49:11.990,00:49:17.412,"I think he needs some real friends to play with, instead of us doddering old folks."
00:49:17.496,00:49:19.539,-Doddering? -Yeah.
00:49:21.249,00:49:22.876,-Hey... -Huh? Yeah?
00:49:24.044,00:49:25.379,How about a dog?
00:49:27.255,00:49:29.174,I'm serious. There's a shelter in Phillips.
00:49:29.257,00:49:30.300,We could drive up there.
00:49:31.051,00:49:32.928,I don't have energy for a puppy.
00:49:33.011,00:49:34.596,I'm not talking about a puppy.
00:49:34.680,00:49:37.974,"I'm talking about a dog, like a real full-fledged dog."
00:49:46.358,00:49:47.693,Sounds like you want a dog.
00:50:10.257,00:50:11.591,"Oh, this one looks nice."
00:50:22.227,00:50:23.520,"Come on, girl."
00:50:26.106,00:50:27.649,So what-- what happened here?
00:50:28.984,00:50:34.740,"She was left outside during the winter, so the vet had to amputate her toes."
00:50:36.700,00:50:38.785,-What are you going to call her? -Bonny.
00:50:40.454,00:50:41.830,Where'd you get that name?
00:50:43.999,00:50:45.500,A girl in my class.
00:50:47.836,00:50:49.337,"Okay, Bonny it is."
00:50:52.716,00:50:54.468,Can we visit her again after dinner?
00:50:56.553,00:50:59.598,Yeah. You can have a short visit to say good night.
00:51:30.921,00:51:32.798,"Okay, get the damn dog."
00:51:32.881,00:51:35.592,"Yeah, you don't want it waking up the whole neighborhood."
00:51:51.566,00:51:53.652,Did you have this in mind all along?
00:52:02.327,00:52:03.161,So...
00:52:05.413,00:52:08.125,Talk to me. Tell me something I don't know about you yet.
00:52:09.209,00:52:11.294,"Hey, you know that dog's on the bed with him?"
00:52:12.212,00:52:13.046,I know.
00:52:13.129,00:52:15.465,"Well, it's going to get your bed awfully dirty."
00:52:15.549,00:52:16.675,I'll wash it.
00:52:18.718,00:52:19.678,Talk to me.
00:52:24.516,00:52:25.976,I wanted to be an artist.
00:52:28.770,00:52:31.273,I had this crazy idea that I could be a painter someday.
00:52:31.356,00:52:33.483,I didn't tell anyone. Diane knew.
00:52:39.322,00:52:41.992,And I had it all mapped out. I was gonna save money.
00:52:42.075,00:52:44.953,-Mm-hmm. -I was gonna sail to Europe and paint.
00:52:45.036,00:52:49.332,I even had a teacher draw up a recommendation for a student visa for me.
00:52:49.875,00:52:51.668,And what happened?
00:52:53.336,00:52:55.380,-You mean why didn't I pursue it? -Yeah.
00:52:57.382,00:52:58.216,Um...
00:53:01.678,00:53:07.684,"Well, I thought I had a-- I'd get a teaching certificate first, and then... then I met Diane."
00:53:08.685,00:53:14.149,"And, uh, then we got married, and when Holly came along, uh, I was already teaching."
00:53:15.150,00:53:19.362,And also spending my summers building houses because I thought we needed more money.
00:53:22.032,00:53:25.368,I remember you fixing houses with other teachers.
00:53:26.703,00:53:27.621,Yeah?
00:54:06.493,00:54:07.535,Ruth?
00:55:00.463,00:55:03.633,Among her many attributes was generosity of spirit.
00:55:04.843,00:55:06.970,Mrs. Joyce was the treasurer of the Rotary Club...
00:55:08.179,00:55:11.141,a 30-year member of the Holt County Fair Committee...
00:57:20.061,00:57:22.063,"Your left foot. Yeah, there you go."
00:57:22.147,00:57:24.774,Then you-- go back like this.
00:57:25.024,00:57:27.819,"And then when you go to throw, you step forward with that foot."
00:57:27.902,00:57:29.195,-There you go. -Like this?
00:57:34.075,00:57:34.909,Let's have it.
00:57:40.165,00:57:41.166,Try it again.
00:57:42.542,00:57:44.669,"You don't understand. You could be looser, you know?"
00:57:44.752,00:57:45.795,You...
00:57:45.879,00:57:48.298,-Just step forward and throw. -Okay.
00:57:48.381,00:57:49.382,Okay?
00:57:53.011,00:57:54.304,There you go.
00:57:54.387,00:57:57.682,"Ooh! Hey, strike."
00:58:01.394,00:58:03.480,"Jamie, this is for you. This is nice and sharp."
00:58:08.818,00:58:10.904,Hoo-hoo! Wow.
00:58:10.987,00:58:12.906,Don't eat them all. Save something for me.
00:58:12.989,00:58:15.241,"Louis, you want a marshmallow?"
00:58:15.325,00:58:17.285,-Huh? -You want a marshmallow?
00:58:17.368,00:58:20.288,"-Is that yours? -Well, you can have it."
00:58:25.752,00:58:27.420,I haven't seen your phone all day.
00:58:28.379,00:58:33.009,"Well, I left it at home because Louis said it probably wouldn't get connection in the mountains."
00:58:33.092,00:58:35.428,"Okay, let's see how it tastes. Are you ready?"
00:58:35.512,00:58:36.971,"All right, try it."
00:58:38.139,00:58:39.015,Mm. Gosh.
00:58:39.849,00:58:42.101,It tastes really good.
00:58:42.185,00:58:45.355,The marshmallow has actually been cooked.
00:58:51.194,00:58:53.488,"If you need us, just call, okay?"
00:59:16.344,00:59:18.137,"You're awfully quiet, Louis."
00:59:21.057,00:59:22.392,"Well, I was just thinking."
00:59:24.894,00:59:27.689,"You know, we used to come here all the time, just the two of us."
00:59:27.772,00:59:28.982,-You and Diane? -Uh-huh.
00:59:31.901,00:59:33.570,We'd come when she was able.
00:59:38.533,00:59:41.119,"She fought hard, did-- didn't she?"
00:59:42.328,00:59:43.997,"Yeah, in the beginning, she did."
00:59:45.540,00:59:47.834,"But in the end, there wasn't much fight left."
00:59:50.545,00:59:55.883,"I would sit with her during the day, and I would bring her food, and I would try to get her to eat."
00:59:57.135,01:00:00.930,"But at the same time, we weren't really talking to each other anymore, and I..."
01:00:02.432,01:00:07.395,"I think she was basically just saying, I'm... I'm done with it."
01:00:08.896,01:00:11.941,"You know, we-- we always think we can fix everything, but..."
01:00:13.693,01:00:15.653,some things we can't fix.
01:00:17.030,01:00:19.073,We have to learn to forgive ourselves.
01:00:20.700,01:00:23.286,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, but that's not it."
01:00:24.537,01:00:28.082,"You know, I mean, Holly and I were there when she passed."
01:00:30.001,01:00:31.544,I remember...
01:00:33.504,01:00:35.214,wanting to feel her leave...
01:00:36.257,01:00:37.967,her spirit or something.
01:00:40.720,01:00:45.058,"And instead, it just seems like she's still around."
01:00:49.145,01:00:51.731,You can tell me anything. You know that.
01:01:58.089,01:02:00.299,"I'm telling you, you're gonna miss that mountain air."
01:02:00.383,01:02:02.135,"-Yeah. -Come on, girl."
01:02:02.677,01:02:05.638,"You know, I think I've decided I really like altitude."
01:02:09.767,01:02:11.936,"Oh, so you got him a dog, huh?"
01:02:12.270,01:02:16.274,Bonny. Louis got her for him. You know Louis Waters.
01:02:16.441,01:02:17.525,"Yes. Hello, Gene."
01:02:17.608,01:02:18.526,"Hi, Mr. Waters."
01:02:19.819,01:02:21.946,I've been trying to call you all day. Where were you?
01:02:24.365,01:02:26.200,"You know, I should be getting back to my place."
01:02:26.284,01:02:27.952,-Would you call me later? -Yeah.
01:02:28.035,01:02:31.164,"-Okay. -Bye, Jamie."
01:02:31.247,01:02:33.166,"-Bye. Thank you. -Good to see you again, Gene."
01:02:38.296,01:02:39.464,We went camping.
01:02:40.214,01:02:41.674,-It was really fun. -It was.
01:02:41.758,01:02:43.509,"-Oh, really? Yeah, you had fun? -Yeah."
01:02:47.221,01:02:48.431,Jamie really liked that.
01:02:56.147,01:02:57.398,"Louis Waters, really?"
01:03:00.276,01:03:01.944,Can we talk about this later?
01:03:07.408,01:03:08.910,"Yeah, yeah, sure you can."
01:03:13.664,01:03:16.292,"-That was 40 years ago. -Yeah, well, it still happened."
01:03:17.543,01:03:18.795,He destroyed a family.
01:03:19.962,01:03:22.173,"He's sorry that he did it, okay?"
01:03:23.591,01:03:25.468,"And he can't fix it now, so..."
01:03:30.598,01:03:31.891,I heard he sleeps over.
01:03:34.477,01:03:36.270,I don't see how that is any of your business.
01:03:36.354,01:03:38.773,"Well, it is my business if my kid is involved."
01:03:42.401,01:03:43.528,I don't want him to get hurt.
01:03:43.611,01:03:47.198,"Oh, you don't think he was already hurt with Bev running off this summer?"
01:03:50.326,01:03:52.078,"Oh, God, I'm sorry."
01:03:52.787,01:03:54.080,I'm sorry.
01:03:55.248,01:03:56.082,Yeah.
01:04:00.586,01:04:04.382,How's everything with Beverly now? And your work?
01:04:05.550,01:04:06.801,Work is fine.
01:04:08.135,01:04:09.345,Work is fine.
01:04:23.484,01:04:31.826,"Well, you know, I'd like to help you if there's any way I can-- Mom, I'm not asking you for anything. Really, please."
01:04:38.082,01:04:39.792,Why were you yelling?
01:04:41.168,01:04:42.795,I wasn't yelling.
01:04:48.676,01:04:50.136,"Hey, come here."
01:04:53.222,01:04:54.807,What do you say? Let's go home.
01:04:58.227,01:05:00.104,"She-- She'll come soon, okay?"
01:05:00.187,01:05:02.523,Just the two of us. All right? Look at me.
01:05:02.607,01:05:05.359,We're gonna have a lot of fun. All right?
01:05:16.078,01:05:19.415,"Honey, it's just your daddy misses you, you know?"
01:05:19.498,01:05:20.541,Come on.
01:05:21.083,01:05:23.002,I want to stay here with you.
01:05:25.504,01:05:28.925,And remember her neck. You're gonna have to be gentle.
01:05:33.387,01:05:36.015,And you're going to be good. I can tell.
01:05:36.098,01:05:38.184,"Now, you call me, okay?"
01:05:38.267,01:05:41.187,I want to know how school is going. I want to know how you are.
01:05:42.396,01:05:44.565,"-I love you. -I love you, too."
01:05:50.446,01:05:52.448,"All right, you put her in the car, all right?"
01:05:53.240,01:05:55.326,-Be patient. -Yeah.
01:05:56.369,01:05:57.662,"-Good-bye, Gene. -Good-bye."
01:06:39.870,01:06:41.706,"You know, I feel it, too."
01:06:41.789,01:06:42.873,The absence.
01:06:45.960,01:06:47.878,But at least he's got the dog with him.
01:06:49.338,01:06:50.172,Yeah.
01:06:52.675,01:06:54.927,The dog was a good idea.
01:07:00.182,01:07:01.017,Hey.
01:07:03.310,01:07:04.729,I've got another idea.
01:07:08.524,01:07:10.401,You ever been to the Brown Palace?
01:07:12.069,01:07:13.654,-In Denver? -Yeah.
01:07:14.447,01:07:16.532,"Yeah, I've always wanted to stay there."
01:07:19.201,01:07:21.787,What do you think? Just the two of us?
01:07:22.872,01:07:25.708,"Get away for a few days, get our minds off of things?"
01:07:26.751,01:07:29.628,"God, I haven't been in the city for ages."
01:08:18.469,01:08:19.678,Louis Waters.
01:08:21.806,01:08:23.933,-Thank you. -Mrs. Waters.
01:08:30.564,01:08:31.398,Uh...
01:08:33.567,01:08:34.527,Here you go.
01:08:56.465,01:08:57.716,Shall we?
01:08:57.800,01:08:59.051,Yeah.
01:10:41.946,01:10:42.780,So...
01:10:43.948,01:10:45.241,we're doing this.
01:10:45.866,01:10:47.910,-Do you want to? -I do.
01:10:54.375,01:10:56.085,"Yeah, but?"
01:10:56.168,01:10:58.212,-No buts. -Oh?
01:10:58.295,01:10:59.755,It has been a while.
01:11:01.590,01:11:03.092,Have you forgotten how?
01:11:04.593,01:11:05.427,No.
01:11:09.932,01:11:10.766,Well...
01:11:13.394,01:11:15.145,"you know, we don't need to rush."
01:11:17.273,01:11:19.191,We can take our time.
01:12:45.486,01:12:57.748,She is what you would call an angry bitch-- -Here. -Here you go.
01:13:10.135,01:13:11.970,I was telling one. Here's another one.
01:13:12.054,01:13:16.100,You guys remember the one about the guy who started to have sex again?
01:13:41.583,01:13:45.254,"I'm gonna go to France, which I'm so excited to go to Paris."
01:13:45.337,01:13:55.514,"I have friends that have moved to Switzerland, so I'll take a little break there and then finally end up in Italy, right in Florence."
01:14:04.440,01:14:07.025,I've already been accepted into a print-making workshop.
01:14:09.111,01:14:10.863,Gonna need any help paying for this?
01:14:11.363,01:14:13.907,-I've saved up a little. -Hmm.
01:14:13.991,01:14:17.411,"I mean, more than a little, actually a lot."
01:14:18.078,01:14:19.663,You know what I wish?
01:14:19.746,01:14:25.002,"I wish that you'd find a really nice guy to travel to Europe with, go to Italy with him?"
01:14:25.085,01:14:28.088,"Travel around, have him take care of you, have him cook for you."
01:14:32.134,01:14:34.595,"You know, maybe she'll find one there."
01:14:35.095,01:14:36.597,"Thank you, Addie."
01:14:37.181,01:14:42.144,My dad seems to think it's his fault that my relationships don't last longer than six months.
01:14:42.811,01:14:44.229,But... yeah.
01:14:45.314,01:14:47.774,I'm trying to take responsibility for my own stuff.
01:14:49.651,01:14:52.821,"-Maybe you two should-- -No, no. Stay, please."
01:14:53.405,01:14:54.406,Don't go.
01:14:59.745,01:15:07.127,"There was, um, a year when I was little when things weren't so good at home."
01:15:10.214,01:15:13.675,And my dad bought me a train set.
01:15:15.302,01:15:21.975,"And he told me that we were gonna build it together, and then when we were done, it was gonna take us to amazing places."
01:15:24.228,01:15:25.395,Well...
01:15:25.479,01:15:29.358,this is me building my own train.
01:15:31.652,01:15:34.446,And I wanted to make sure to come here and tell you that.
01:15:37.199,01:15:42.079,And my therapist wanted me to come here and tell you that.
01:15:52.923,01:15:53.882,Hey.
01:16:00.264,01:16:01.431,I'm gonna hang on to this...
01:16:05.394,01:16:06.645,I'll get the check.
01:16:16.697,01:16:17.781,Good for you.
01:16:17.864,01:16:21.076,"Bye, Addie. Bye, Dad. I love you. I'll call you!"
01:16:39.928,01:16:42.139,That daughter of yours is really something.
01:16:42.222,01:16:43.807,"-Yeah, she sure is. -Wow."
01:16:49.563,01:16:51.481,-Do you know what I realized? -What?
01:16:51.565,01:16:53.859,We're not big news anymore.
01:16:55.444,01:16:58.071,We're not only not big news. We're not even little news anymore.
01:17:01.491,01:17:05.787,I just want to live out my day and then come tell you about it at night.
01:17:51.541,01:17:53.001,"Hey, Louis."
01:17:55.087,01:17:57.297,Everyone's been looking for you all morning.
01:17:57.381,01:17:58.465,Where have you been?
01:17:59.049,01:18:01.259,I was up at Phillips getting my winter tires. Why?
01:18:02.761,01:18:04.262,"Uh, hey, Louis, um..."
01:18:05.138,01:18:06.390,W-- What's up?
01:18:38.088,01:18:39.923,-Yes? -Addie Moore?
01:18:40.006,01:18:41.299,Addie Moore.
01:18:49.474,01:18:51.017,-Oh. -I didn't mean to scare you.
01:18:58.442,01:19:01.820,It was just a dumb fall. I-- I wasn't paying attention.
01:19:03.488,01:19:05.031,You have much pain?
01:19:06.199,01:19:08.493,-Mm. -Yeah.
01:19:08.577,01:19:11.371,"I'm gonna have to have surgery, but I'm gonna be okay."
01:19:12.622,01:19:13.790,What can I do?
01:19:15.959,01:19:17.252,Kiss me?
01:19:17.753,01:19:18.628,Really?
01:19:28.889,01:19:30.515,"Yeah, you'll be fine?"
01:19:30.599,01:19:33.101,"I just spoke to the doctors, and they say it's not so good."
01:19:37.731,01:19:40.358,I'm sorry. Would you mind stepping out for a second?
01:19:45.739,01:19:49.117,"Mom, it's supposed to be family only back here, all right?"
01:19:51.453,01:19:54.206,It's okay. I'll go back to the house and pick up some stuff.
01:20:33.286,01:20:37.791,He's worried that I'm too far away and on my own.
01:20:40.585,01:20:42.420,I told him I was not on my own.
01:20:51.513,01:20:52.931,"Well, I appreciate that."
01:21:01.314,01:21:02.274,I guess it's...
01:21:05.151,01:21:06.486,"I guess it's good, right?"
01:21:08.154,01:21:09.447,"I mean, he cares about you."
01:21:11.575,01:21:12.492,"I, um..."
01:21:14.578,01:21:16.746,I don't think Beverly's coming back.
01:21:25.755,01:21:27.382,So what are you gonna do?
01:21:30.802,01:21:32.679,"Well, I told him..."
01:21:34.639,01:21:36.600,that I couldn't just...
01:21:39.895,01:21:42.939,I couldn't just give up everything and leave here.
01:21:45.775,01:21:46.902,Mm.
01:21:47.402,01:21:50.739,What was it you said about not trying to fix everything all the time?
01:21:50.822,01:21:52.824,"That was for you, not me."
01:22:01.124,01:22:02.667,I missed our bed.
01:22:03.335,01:22:04.169,Yeah.
01:22:27.609,01:22:30.028,Hello? Jamie?
01:23:24.165,01:23:25.834,Where's this go?
01:23:25.917,01:23:28.378,I think that you can finish this here.
01:23:28.461,01:23:30.296,-See if that fits. -No.
01:23:30.380,01:23:31.756,No?
01:23:31.840,01:23:33.174,"Well, you did great here."
01:23:34.467,01:23:36.011,This is awesome.
01:23:48.857,01:23:50.108,Almost.
01:24:03.621,01:24:05.373,"Hey, let's take this into your room, okay?"
01:24:06.583,01:24:09.461,"Come on, here. Let's finish this off in your room."
01:24:12.589,01:24:14.132,"Okay, I'm going."
01:24:24.184,01:24:25.018,Gene?
01:24:27.395,01:24:28.897,Where the hell have you been?
01:24:32.650,01:24:35.945,He's seven years old. What the hell are you thinking?
01:24:43.161,01:24:46.247,Is it-- Is that Louis' truck?
01:24:46.331,01:24:47.248,Yes.
01:24:49.167,01:24:50.919,He's inside with Jamie.
01:24:53.922,01:24:58.093,"So you and Louis Waters are going to have a pretend family, is that it?"
01:25:02.097,01:25:02.931,Come here.
01:25:06.726,01:25:09.062,Stop pretending like you care. Come on.
01:25:13.066,01:25:15.401,"No, you don't, and you never did."
01:25:16.194,01:25:20.865,"And that's okay. It's okay-- I know that I wasn't perfect, but I tried."
01:25:20.949,01:25:22.534,"No, you didn't! You didn't!"
01:25:39.050,01:25:40.135,Uh...
01:25:43.138,01:25:44.556,Look what I did.
01:25:48.017,01:25:48.852,Come inside.
01:25:50.854,01:25:52.355,"Listen, I gotta tell you something."
01:25:55.316,01:25:56.985,Do you remember that night...
01:26:02.532,01:26:04.450,I remember the ambulance. Of course.
01:26:04.534,01:26:07.453,"-Yeah? -Oh, God, Gene."
01:26:07.537,01:26:08.872,"Now, you remember or you don't."
01:26:10.790,01:26:12.876,I'm giving you another chance here.
01:26:15.211,01:26:17.338,-Of course I remember the ambulance. -You do? Okay.
01:26:17.422,01:26:20.925,You couldn't even look at me for weeks.
01:26:24.929,01:26:28.558,"Oh, honey, I never blamed anybody for Connie's death."
01:26:31.728,01:26:32.562,I didn't.
01:26:35.940,01:26:37.150,Stop denying it.
01:26:42.989,01:26:44.282,Stop denying it.
01:27:00.715,01:27:02.050,"I'm, uh..."
01:27:02.133,01:27:04.093,I appreciate you coming here.
01:27:05.762,01:27:06.679,Let's go inside.
01:27:53.685,01:27:56.688,"Louis, do you mind if I sleep alone tonight?"
01:28:01.484,01:28:02.318,Okay.
01:28:04.737,01:28:06.990,Can I at least help you upstairs?
01:28:54.495,01:28:55.330,Hey.
01:29:12.096,01:29:14.265,"Addie, you can't let him get to you like this."
01:29:15.975,01:29:16.809,I know you.
01:29:22.148,01:29:23.608,I know you're a good mother.
01:29:24.901,01:29:26.152,"No, I did all the right things."
01:29:26.235,01:29:30.615,I took him to his soccer games and his dentist appointments and...
01:29:33.409,01:29:34.410,Addie.
01:29:35.161,01:29:36.788,I did everything you're supposed to do.
01:29:38.873,01:29:40.792,He was only five.
01:29:42.627,01:29:44.253,He needed me.
01:29:48.883,01:29:53.971,"I have to try to make things right with Gene, and for... for Jamie."
01:29:57.642,01:29:58.476,You know...
01:29:59.811,01:30:01.479,there's nothing for me here either.
01:30:03.147,01:30:04.899,"Addie, you're where I want to be."
01:30:08.236,01:30:10.488,"I can't take you with me, Louis."
01:30:12.031,01:30:12.865,I can't.
01:30:18.704,01:30:20.123,They're my family.
01:30:41.769,01:30:42.937,"Bye, Nana!"
01:30:43.020,01:30:44.272,"Have a good day, okay?"
01:31:41.579,01:31:52.089,"That time that I was with my friend Oliver, and we were just digging and having a nice little time, and then suddenly I hit something hard."
01:31:52.173,01:31:54.884,You know what that was? That was a nail.
01:31:54.967,01:32:04.393,"More than a hundred years because my friend's dad knows a lot about history, and he confirmed that it was probably more than a hundred years ago."
01:32:04.477,01:32:06.854,And he said it was more than a hundred years old.
01:32:08.940,01:32:10.858,-Will you show it to me later? -Okay.
01:32:11.943,01:32:15.196,"What do you suppose it was from, a railroad tie or something?"
01:32:15.279,01:32:17.531,Mnh-mnh. It looked very thin.
01:32:22.745,01:32:24.997,Keep it and then sell it in ten years.
01:32:25.081,01:32:26.874,-Mm... -When it's 200 years old.
01:32:57.280,01:32:58.781,You've got mature trees.
01:32:58.864,01:33:01.742,"You know, you just can't get landscaping like this anymore, right?"
01:33:18.092,01:33:18.926,"Hey, Rudy."
01:33:22.805,01:33:23.681,"Hey, Louis."
01:33:32.690,01:33:33.983,Sorry to hear about Charlie.
01:33:34.066,01:33:37.278,"Uh, yeah. He went in his sleep."
01:33:38.904,01:33:40.698,"That's the best way to go, if you ask me."
01:35:21.090,01:35:28.764,"Weeks passed, and the little rabbit grew very old and shabby, but the boy loved him just as much."
01:35:28.848,01:35:34.395,He loved him so hard that he loved all his whiskers off.
01:35:34.478,01:35:40.234,"And the pink lining to his ears turned gray, and his brown spots faded."
01:35:40.317,01:35:49.452,"He even began to lose his shape, and he scarcely looked like a rabbit anymore, except to the boy."
01:36:37.166,01:36:38.292,Hello?
01:36:40.628,01:36:41.462,Louis?
01:36:46.967,01:36:49.386,I'm-- I'm having trouble sleeping.
01:36:49.470,01:36:52.181,"Yeah, you and me both."
01:36:54.016,01:36:55.518,What should we do about it?
01:36:58.562,01:36:59.396,I don't know.
01:37:06.278,01:37:08.322,"The nights are the worst, don't you think?"
01:37:16.830,01:37:19.583,We could try talking. What do you think about that?
01:37:21.335,01:37:23.003,"Oh, I think that's a good idea."
01:37:26.840,01:37:28.884,Never know what it might lead to.
01:37:31.178,01:37:32.805,So what do you want to talk about?
01:37:40.271,01:37:41.689,The weather.
