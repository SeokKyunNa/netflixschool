00:00:30.530,00:00:32.949,Get out of my way! Get out of my way!
00:00:34.867,00:00:37.454,That's my boy. That's my boy.
00:00:37.537,00:00:38.788,-Matty! Matty! -Dad.
00:00:38.871,00:00:40.665,"Matty! Matty! Don't, don't move, okay?"
00:00:40.748,00:00:42.375,"No, no, no! Just-- Don't move."
00:00:42.459,00:00:43.876,Somebody get us some help!
00:00:43.960,00:00:45.587,"-Dad, what happened? -Matty, it's gonna be all right."
00:00:45.670,00:00:47.630,"-Just don't move. Don't move, okay? -What happened?"
00:00:55.055,00:00:58.600,Your boy... He pushed me out of the way.
00:01:00.143,00:01:01.311,He saved my life.
00:01:11.028,00:01:12.197,"Oh, Jesus!"
00:01:13.948,00:01:15.742,"Close your eyes, Matty."
00:01:15.825,00:01:17.244,-Dad! -Close your eyes.
00:01:17.327,00:01:18.828,-Dad! Dad! -Close your eyes.
00:01:18.911,00:01:20.413,Dad. Dad. Dad.
00:01:25.001,00:01:27.629,I can't see. I can't see!
00:01:27.712,00:01:29.297,I can't see!
00:01:31.966,00:01:34.136,I can't see!
00:01:34.219,00:01:36.179,I can't see!
00:01:40.642,00:01:42.059,"It's been, uh..."
00:01:43.811,00:01:46.063,It's been too long since my last confession.
00:01:46.981,00:01:50.443,"My dad, he used to come to this church back when I was a kid."
00:01:50.527,00:01:53.780,He was a fighter. Old school. Boxer.
00:01:54.864,00:01:59.286,"Lost more than he won. Had a 24-31 record before he, uh..."
00:02:04.957,00:02:07.502,But he could take a punch.
00:02:07.585,00:02:10.004,"-Jesus, he could take a punch. -Language."
00:02:10.922,00:02:12.424,"Sorry, Father."
00:02:14.509,00:02:17.845,"Yeah, guys he went up against used to say it was like hitting oak."
00:02:18.888,00:02:23.976,"And nights when he was outmatched, my dad's strategy was to let 'em hit him till they broke their hands."
00:02:27.230,00:02:30.150,"He never got knocked out, my dad."
00:02:30.233,00:02:34.446,"Knocked down, sure. But he, uh, always got back up."
00:02:36.531,00:02:38.325,He was always on his feet when he lost.
00:02:39.992,00:02:42.204,"Every now and then, though, uh..."
00:02:46.999,00:02:49.336,"Every now and then, he'd get hit and..."
00:02:52.380,00:02:54.549,something inside of him would snap.
00:02:56.008,00:02:59.471,"My grandmother, she was the real Catholic."
00:02:59.554,00:03:02.390,Fear of God ran deep. You'd have liked her.
00:03:05.017,00:03:07.604,"She used to say, Be careful of the Murdock boys."
00:03:13.276,00:03:15.362,And you'd see it sometimes...
00:03:17.239,00:03:18.656,in the ring.
00:03:22.201,00:03:24.120,His eyes would go dead...
00:03:26.373,00:03:29.166,and he'd start walking forward real slow...
00:03:31.794,00:03:34.464,"hands at his sides, like he wasn't afraid of anything."
00:03:37.717,00:03:42.179,"And the other guy, he'd see that look, and he'd try to get away from him."
00:03:43.931,00:03:45.267,Nah.
00:03:45.350,00:03:49.312,"My dad, he'd catch him and... trap him in the corner."
00:03:56.193,00:03:57.862,Let the devil out.
00:04:00.114,00:04:01.241,Yeah.
00:04:02.909,00:04:05.537,"Now, I didn't understand it, you know?"
00:04:06.579,00:04:10.166,"What he was feeling deep inside, I didn't understand it."
00:04:18.383,00:04:19.884,Not back then.
00:04:22.262,00:04:24.722,But you understand it now?
00:04:26.140,00:04:29.936,Perhaps this would be easier if you tell me what you've done.
00:04:36.359,00:04:39.111,"I'm not seeking penance for what I've done, Father."
00:04:40.488,00:04:42.324,I'm asking forgiveness...
00:04:43.450,00:04:45.285,for what I'm about to do.
00:04:45.827,00:04:47.912,That's not how this works.
00:04:50.247,00:04:53.209,What exactly are you going to do?
00:04:56.045,00:04:57.547,Help! Help me!
00:04:58.631,00:05:00.550,Help! Help me!
00:05:04.136,00:05:05.888,Hey! Hey!
00:05:05.972,00:05:07.432,"Man, shut up."
00:05:07.515,00:05:11.060,"I'm getting $1,000 a head for y'all."
00:05:11.143,00:05:13.646,"So, you be quiet..."
00:05:14.564,00:05:17.066,I let you have a bucket.
00:05:17.149,00:05:18.568,You don't...
00:05:31.331,00:05:32.999,Scream all you want.
00:05:33.082,00:05:34.667,"Come on, let me hear you scream."
00:05:34.751,00:05:35.960,Scream loud.
00:07:10.722,00:07:14.642,Head towards 48th. Stay in the lights. Flag down the first officer you see.
00:08:48.152,00:08:49.779,"-Yeah, yeah. -Foggy."
00:08:51.363,00:08:52.406,Hello.
00:08:54.576,00:08:57.036,-What time is it? -Half past get the hell up.
00:08:57.119,00:09:03.042,Let's go. We gotta meet What was that? Was that a moan?
00:09:04.961,00:09:09.381,"The paralegal? Is it the para over at-- Never mind, I don't wanna hear about it."
00:09:09.465,00:09:12.051,"No, I do wanna hear about it! What was she like?"
00:09:14.929,00:09:17.640,I gotta get the blind thing going. It's so unfair.
00:09:17.724,00:09:20.810,"Oh, hey! Real estate agent, not your type."
00:09:20.893,00:09:23.980,Very homely. Might be genetic. No need to be charming.
00:09:24.063,00:09:26.941,And she kinda told me she thinks blind people are God's mistake.
00:09:28.150,00:09:29.777,"That's a horrible thing to say, Foggy."
00:09:29.861,00:09:32.029,I know! In this day and age?
00:09:32.113,00:09:34.323,"All right, shake it. I gotta go bribe a cop."
00:09:34.406,00:09:35.491,"Ah, Foggy."
00:09:35.575,00:09:37.660,"Kidding, NSA, if you're listening."
00:09:37.744,00:09:40.872,"But seriously, yeah, I gotta go bribe a cop."
00:09:50.632,00:09:53.259,Officer of the law.
00:09:53.342,00:09:56.512,Defense attorney. We're supposed to be enemies.
00:09:57.179,00:10:02.059,"First off, we've been enemies since we were four, Brett, so let's not blame it on career choices."
00:10:02.143,00:10:08.149,"Secondly, I'm not a particularly good defense attorney, so helping me is like helping yourself."
00:10:08.232,00:10:11.068,"And finally, these are for Bess."
00:10:15.740,00:10:17.491,"Please stop giving my mom cigars, Foggy."
00:10:17.574,00:10:19.493,What? She'll outlive us all.
00:10:19.576,00:10:21.746,"Look, I'm not asking you to do anything immoral."
00:10:21.829,00:10:25.708,"Just give me a heads up if something, you know, interesting walks through the door."
00:10:27.126,00:10:29.629,You're right. It ain't the careers.
00:10:30.713,00:10:32.214,"Thanks, buddy!"
00:10:37.386,00:10:41.015,"You've got a reception area, a conference room and two offices."
00:10:41.098,00:10:43.142,Corner suite has a view of the Hudson.
00:10:43.225,00:10:44.977,You can flip a coin with your partner for it.
00:10:45.061,00:10:46.395,"Uh, he can have the view."
00:10:48.731,00:10:56.530,I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to-- Susan Harris. Midtown Property Solutions.
00:10:56.613,00:10:58.115,Matt Murdock.
00:11:01.160,00:11:03.495,She just curtsied. It was adorable.
00:11:03.579,00:11:06.415,"Well, it's nice to know chivalry isn't dead."
00:11:06.498,00:11:09.293,"Susan, would you mind walking me around the space?"
00:11:09.376,00:11:11.838,Of course. My pleasure.
00:11:11.921,00:11:18.845,"As I was telling your associate, this office was barely touched by the incident, which is why it's on the market already."
00:11:18.928,00:11:20.637,The neighbors weren't so lucky.
00:11:20.722,00:11:23.808,The incident? Is that what we're calling it now?
00:11:23.891,00:11:29.521,"Well, it sounds so much better than death and destruction raining from the sky, nearly wiping Hell's Kitchen off the map."
00:11:29.605,00:11:30.898,"Shorter, too."
00:11:30.982,00:11:35.111,Owner figuring in the delightful view of cranes and scaffolding?
00:11:35.194,00:11:37.238,Feels like we're getting pre-incident prices.
00:11:37.321,00:11:39.573,They're a quarter of what they used to be.
00:11:39.656,00:11:45.287,"Hell's Kitchen's on the rebound, Mr. Nelson, and in 18 months, you won't be able to rent a broom closet at this price point."
00:11:45.371,00:11:46.622,We'll take it.
00:11:47.999,00:11:50.126,We will talk about it.
00:11:50.209,00:11:56.298,"Because we're not sure we can afford even this palace, unless we make some changes to our current clientele policies."
00:11:56.382,00:11:59.927,My partner and I are having some disagreements over the direction of Nelson and Murdock.
00:12:00.011,00:12:01.678,I believe we're here to defend the innocent.
00:12:01.763,00:12:05.224,And I believe the innocent includes everyone not yet convicted of a crime.
00:12:05.307,00:12:07.101,"You know, as the law states."
00:12:07.184,00:12:09.145,He tends to use fancy terminology.
00:12:09.228,00:12:18.612,"And my partner fails to recognize that, as defense attorneys, we're never gonna be able to keep the lights on, waiting on a horde of innocent souls to stumble into our loving arms."
00:12:18.695,00:12:21.365,"At this point, I'd settle for just one."
00:12:35.171,00:12:36.380,Drop the knife!
00:12:36.463,00:12:38.382,"-No, no, I didn't-- -Drop it!"
00:12:38.465,00:12:40.634,I didn't do this! I didn't-- I didn't do this!
00:12:40.717,00:12:42.386,-Get on the ground! -I didn't do this!
00:12:42.469,00:12:43.930,"-Now! -Oh, God!"
00:12:48.810,00:12:50.937,"Oh, God! I didn't do this!"
00:12:51.020,00:12:52.063,"Oh, no!"
00:12:53.898,00:12:55.732,I didn't do this!
00:13:10.164,00:13:14.376,Female suspect found at the scene. Definitely qualifies as interesting.
00:13:15.044,00:13:16.420,She's been charged yet?
00:13:16.503,00:13:18.505,Assistant DA hasn't made the call yet.
00:13:18.589,00:13:20.007,Do you have a name on the suspect?
00:13:20.091,00:13:22.259,Yeah. Page.
00:13:28.599,00:13:31.936,"Okay, can we please take the handcuffs off the 110-pound woman?"
00:13:32.019,00:13:35.147,"Miss Page, can you tell me who these men are?"
00:13:35.231,00:13:36.482,We're her lawyers.
00:13:36.565,00:13:38.150,"Uncuff our client and give us the room, please."
00:13:48.035,00:13:49.828,"Thank you, Detective."
00:13:59.088,00:14:02.925,"Miss Page, my name is Matt Murdock. This is my associate, Foggy Nelson."
00:14:03.009,00:14:04.426,Do you mind if we sit down?
00:14:06.595,00:14:09.473,She gave a vague shrug. I say we go with it.
00:14:11.392,00:14:14.561,We understand you're in some trouble.
00:14:14.645,00:14:16.605,"We, uh, may be able to help."
00:14:22.569,00:14:24.488,"Why don't we start with what we know, then?"
00:14:26.365,00:14:29.869,You were found in your apartment with one Daniel Fisher.
00:14:29.952,00:14:34.206,"Who appears to be the victim of a homicide, and currently, you're the only suspect, Miss Page."
00:14:34.290,00:14:35.749,Who the hell are you guys?
00:14:35.832,00:14:37.626,I'm Matt. He's Foggy.
00:14:38.920,00:14:40.004,Who sent you?
00:14:40.087,00:14:41.797,No one sent us.
00:14:42.714,00:14:45.426,"So, what? You're just a couple of Good Samaritans?"
00:14:46.843,00:14:48.554,Today's just my lucky day?
00:14:48.637,00:14:51.974,I bribed the desk sergeant with a box of cigars for his mom.
00:14:53.893,00:14:56.187,and we are aggressively pursuing new clientele.
00:14:56.270,00:14:57.646,You gotta stop giving Bess cigars.
00:14:57.729,00:15:00.357,"She likes to smoke, Matt. It's a free country."
00:15:00.441,00:15:03.569,So how long have you been practicing law?
00:15:05.071,00:15:06.363,What time is it?
00:15:06.447,00:15:08.490,It's 12:22 a.m.
00:15:08.574,00:15:09.866,About seven hours.
00:15:11.077,00:15:13.787,"Well, if you go from when we passed the bar-- I was going from when we got our own desks."
00:15:13.870,00:15:16.082,"Oh, then, yeah. Seven hours."
00:15:17.541,00:15:19.251,You've never done this before?
00:15:19.335,00:15:23.172,"If you were to hire us, then, yes, you would be our first client."
00:15:23.255,00:15:24.631,Technically. Yeah.
00:15:26.883,00:15:28.594,"Well, I don't... I don't have any money."
00:15:29.553,00:15:32.098,"Well, it was lovely to meet you, Miss Page."
00:15:34.891,00:15:36.852,You don't have any money and we don't have any clients.
00:15:36.936,00:15:39.313,Maybe we can help each other.
00:15:39.396,00:15:41.148,"Tell me, how did you know Mr. Fisher?"
00:15:43.359,00:15:44.568,We worked together.
00:15:49.490,00:15:50.824,And your place of employment?
00:15:50.907,00:15:54.161,Union Allied Construction.
00:15:55.704,00:15:57.289,I'm a secretary.
00:15:58.958,00:16:01.377,Daniel worked downstairs in Legal.
00:16:07.049,00:16:11.428,"But it's hard to meet people in the city, so I asked him if he would have a drink with me."
00:16:11.512,00:16:13.097,You asked him?
00:16:18.727,00:16:22.106,"We met at the Three Roads bar, on 49th Street."
00:16:22.189,00:16:28.320,"We had a few drinks, and the next thing that I remember is waking up on the floor of my apartment covered in blood."
00:16:28.404,00:16:29.571,His blood.
00:16:31.032,00:16:33.659,"No, I'm not stupid. I know how that sounds."
00:16:34.868,00:16:38.164,But I am telling you we met at the bar. We had a few drinks.
00:16:38.247,00:16:41.083,And I don't know what happened after that.
00:16:42.668,00:16:43.877,It wasn't me.
00:16:44.503,00:16:45.712,Please.
00:16:50.717,00:16:52.719,I didn't kill him.
00:16:56.307,00:16:58.350,"I believe you, Miss Page."
00:17:20.289,00:17:21.957,There's plenty of room over there. Do you mind?
00:17:22.541,00:17:26.002,"28,957."
00:17:28.630,00:17:30.424,Tell Rigoletto he'll get his money.
00:17:30.507,00:17:32.468,Mr. Rigoletto has retired.
00:17:32.551,00:17:35.387,His books have been acquired by my employer.
00:17:35.471,00:17:38.099,"Ah. Well, you tell him the same thing."
00:17:39.350,00:17:41.102,I'd like to show you something.
00:17:43.479,00:17:45.106,Do you have a moment?
00:18:00.912,00:18:04.625,What is it about college girls and Monet T-shirts?
00:18:05.542,00:18:11.465,"Open composition and the spontaneity reflecting this transformative time in their lives, perhaps?"
00:18:12.591,00:18:15.302,Or maybe they just like the color blue.
00:18:16.262,00:18:17.554,Call her.
00:18:31.235,00:18:32.361,"Hey, Dad, what's up?"
00:18:35.656,00:18:37.073,You need anything?
00:18:37.908,00:18:40.869,"Uh, yeah, I actually have a ton of laundry."
00:18:40.952,00:18:43.539,I was gonna swing by this weekend and use the machine.
00:18:43.622,00:18:46.542,"And then, maybe we could catch a movie after your shift?"
00:18:46.625,00:18:49.002,"Yeah, yeah. That'd be great."
00:18:49.085,00:18:53.840,"Uh, look-- Baby, I got-- I gotta go. I love you, baby."
00:18:53.924,00:18:55.884,"Love you, too. Bye, Dad."
00:19:00.514,00:19:02.391,"Now, you see this man here?"
00:19:03.184,00:19:08.814,"If we're being honest with each other, Mr. Farnum, I find his methods unpleasant."
00:19:11.233,00:19:13.652,But such are the times we live in.
00:19:15.196,00:19:17.323,"Give us a wave, Mr. Rance."
00:19:22.828,00:19:26.498,I told you that I will get you the money.
00:19:26.582,00:19:30.294,Such a small sum is of little interest to my employer.
00:19:30.377,00:19:34.005,"Your position, however, that's something we can work with."
00:19:41.930,00:19:43.974,What do you want me to do?
00:19:47.394,00:19:49.896,I'm friends with Gary Feinstein in the DA's office.
00:19:49.980,00:19:52.358,"I'll give him a call first thing in the morning, see where their heads are at."
00:19:53.442,00:19:57.028,"I'm guessing they're gonna puff their chests, but they have to know murder two's a risk."
00:19:57.112,00:20:01.325,"We end up at manslaughter, we get the right judge, -maybe she's out in five to 10-- -We're not taking a deal."
00:20:01.408,00:20:02.784,"No, this is why they have deals, Matt."
00:20:02.868,00:20:04.828,So the straightforward cases don't waste everybody's time.
00:20:04.911,00:20:06.205,I don't think she did it.
00:20:06.288,00:20:14.963,"She's the sole suspect, found at the scene, covered in blood, with the murder weapon and no defensive wounds."
00:20:15.046,00:20:18.300,"If they offer anything it'll be a gift, and we will take that gift."
00:20:18.384,00:20:20.010,We do not want this to go to trial.
00:20:20.093,00:20:21.136,"They don't want this to go to trial, either."
00:20:21.220,00:20:22.471,Why hasn't she been charged yet?
00:20:22.554,00:20:25.056,They have 24 hours. And it's the weekend.
00:20:25.140,00:20:27.559,They're gonna take every last second to collect the evidence before they move.
00:20:27.643,00:20:29.936,They've got the evidence. You just laid it out yourself.
00:20:30.020,00:20:31.855,"This is a good arrest, Foggy."
00:20:31.938,00:20:34.733,We should already be reading about it in the papers.
00:20:34.816,00:20:37.027,There's something not right about this case. I can feel it.
00:20:38.237,00:20:39.321,You can feel it?
00:20:39.405,00:20:42.991,"All right, I'm just gonna say this once, and we can move on."
00:20:44.117,00:20:47.538,"You don't necessarily show the best judgment when beautiful women are involved, Matt."
00:20:47.621,00:20:48.872,How would I even know if she's a beautiful woman?
00:20:48.955,00:20:51.458,"I don't know. It's kinda spooky, actually."
00:20:51.542,00:20:57.673,"But if there's a stunning woman with questionable character in the room, Matt Murdock's gonna find her and Foggy Nelson is gonna suffer."
00:21:00.801,00:21:03.845,"-Thank you. -But I need you to back me, anyway."
00:21:06.682,00:21:09.976,"All right. Fine. Let's start with the obvious, then."
00:21:10.894,00:21:12.313,"If she didn't do it, who did?"
00:21:12.396,00:21:14.981,We're dead in the water if we don't give them an alternative.
00:21:15.065,00:21:16.275,Agreed.
00:21:17.233,00:21:20.070,We need to take another run at our client.
00:21:21.112,00:21:26.410,"She may not be guilty, Matt, but that doesn't mean Miss Page is telling the truth."
00:21:59.150,00:22:00.319,I'm sorry.
00:22:00.402,00:22:02.571,I'm-- I'm sorry.
00:22:25.969,00:22:28.013,"I'm gonna make this easy, Detectives."
00:22:28.096,00:22:36.688,"Get the ADA in here to release Miss Page and we'll recommend to our charming, media-friendly client that she not plaster the airwaves with how she was nearly killed in your custody."
00:22:36.772,00:22:41.818,And I'll agree not to make cooing noises for the rest of this meeting when I think of the civil suit that we have on our hands.
00:22:41.902,00:22:43.236,How do you know they're not charging her?
00:22:43.319,00:22:46.156,Besides the fact that you were required to do so four hours ago...
00:22:46.239,00:22:48.283,if you were gonna do it at all?
00:22:48.366,00:22:50.160,That's an excellent question.
00:22:50.243,00:22:54.456,Along with how the security cameras on Miss Page's detention area went on the fritz right before the assault.
00:22:54.540,00:22:58.919,"Yeah, we'd like to speak to Mr. Farnum about that, as well as what-- Get in line. He'll be arraigned in the morning."
00:22:59.002,00:23:01.171,Get my client released. Don't make me ask again.
00:23:09.179,00:23:11.097,I'll call the ADA.
00:23:12.015,00:23:17.438,"But you take that tone with me again, I don't care if you're blind, I'll kick the shit out of you."
00:23:17.521,00:23:19.565,Really? We're going there?
00:23:26.905,00:23:29.324,It doesn't make any sense.
00:23:29.407,00:23:31.785,ADA had everything they needed.
00:23:33.119,00:23:34.370,Unless they had too much.
00:23:35.413,00:23:36.873,What? What am I missing?
00:23:37.958,00:23:39.751,Maybe someone else was in her apartment that night.
00:23:39.835,00:23:41.086,Maybe they have evidence.
00:23:41.169,00:23:42.963,That's Brady material. They'd have to turn that over.
00:23:43.046,00:23:44.422,Only if she were charged.
00:23:44.506,00:23:47.718,"She hangs herself in her cell, this all goes away."
00:23:50.554,00:23:51.805,and get the hell out of here.
00:23:59.145,00:24:02.608,Couldn't find any milk. I hope it's okay.
00:24:11.742,00:24:12.951,How are you holding up?
00:24:13.034,00:24:14.244,Better.
00:24:16.037,00:24:17.455,Thanks for getting me out.
00:24:18.790,00:24:21.585,Just because they released you doesn't mean they won't eventually bring charges.
00:24:23.545,00:24:26.422,other than the two of us about what happened.
00:24:28.258,00:24:30.218,"I don't have anyone to talk to, anyway."
00:24:30.844,00:24:32.387,Do you have somewhere you can stay tonight?
00:24:32.470,00:24:34.515,My apartment's not far.
00:24:34.598,00:24:36.975,You can't go back there.
00:24:37.058,00:24:40.937,"Miss Page, our immediate priority is to keep you safe."
00:24:41.021,00:24:43.940,"And in order to do that, we're gonna need to have a frank discussion."
00:24:46.777,00:24:47.861,Okay.
00:24:48.403,00:24:49.988,Do you know who's trying to kill you?
00:24:51.322,00:24:52.448,No.
00:24:52.533,00:24:55.076,Do you know why they're trying to kill you?
00:25:00.999,00:25:02.333,Yes.
00:25:06.922,00:25:11.259,Worked in the financial department at Union Allied.
00:25:12.468,00:25:16.723,They're overseeing the bulk of the government contracts for the West Side reconstruction.
00:25:16.807,00:25:19.017,I've seen their signs all over Hell's Kitchen.
00:25:20.686,00:25:23.939,The last two years have transformed the business.
00:25:24.022,00:25:27.108,"There's new owners, new grants, new contracts."
00:25:27.192,00:25:30.320,"Yeah, the world watched half of New York get destroyed."
00:25:30.403,00:25:31.738,That's a lot of sympathy.
00:25:31.822,00:25:35.826,And Union Allied benefited from every dollar of it.
00:25:37.118,00:25:40.622,I was the secretary for the chief accountant.
00:25:42.666,00:25:44.334,And one of my jobs...
00:25:45.919,00:25:49.297,was to coordinate the pension claims for the company.
00:25:51.216,00:25:55.929,"About a week ago, I was emailed a file called, Pension Master."
00:25:58.849,00:26:02.560,"It must have been meant for my boss, but I made the mistake of opening it."
00:26:02.644,00:26:04.479,I'm guessing it wasn't the pension fund.
00:26:06.898,00:26:09.735,It wasn't the size of the pension fund.
00:26:11.945,00:26:14.239,I couldn't believe the numbers.
00:26:15.490,00:26:19.035,But it was still being designated as company pension.
00:26:19.119,00:26:22.998,And it was constantly adjusted. Money coming in and money going out.
00:26:23.081,00:26:24.791,-Going where? -I don't know.
00:26:24.875,00:26:29.420,"It was coded routing numbers, but we are talking a lot of money."
00:26:29.504,00:26:31.547,What did you do with the file?
00:26:32.841,00:26:37.846,"Well, I told my boss, Mr. McClintock, about it, and he laughed it off."
00:26:38.847,00:26:43.727,He said that it was a theoretical model that they were screwing around with.
00:26:43.810,00:26:46.354,I knew something was wrong.
00:26:48.023,00:26:51.735,"I just-- I thought maybe it was just him, you know?"
00:26:51.818,00:26:53.737,Embezzling or whatever.
00:26:56.031,00:26:58.784,"So, how did Daniel Fisher figure into this?"
00:26:58.867,00:27:01.452,Danny worked in the legal department.
00:27:04.039,00:27:06.457,And I didn't know him very well.
00:27:06.541,00:27:10.128,"But he was nice, so I asked him to meet me after work."
00:27:11.587,00:27:13.674,I don't know how they knew.
00:27:15.133,00:27:17.552,They must have people watching me.
00:27:17.635,00:27:20.430,They must have people everywhere.
00:27:21.514,00:27:23.934,All I did was ask him for a drink.
00:27:25.185,00:27:30.065,And I start to tell him about what I found and things got blurry.
00:27:30.148,00:27:31.858,Like I was drugged.
00:27:32.984,00:27:38.531,"And the next thing I know, I wake up... back in my apartment, covered in blood."
00:27:43.536,00:27:45.080,They killed him...
00:27:47.791,00:27:49.500,because of me.
00:27:51.086,00:27:52.670,And he had a family.
00:27:55.006,00:27:56.591,A little boy.
00:28:00.721,00:28:03.514,"-I need to get out of here. I'm sorry. -We can't advise that, Miss Page."
00:28:03.598,00:28:06.727,"No, you don't understand. Either you're with them or you're not."
00:28:06.810,00:28:08.478,"And if you're with them, then I'm dead already."
00:28:08.561,00:28:11.940,"And if you are not, then I cannot have anybody else die because of me."
00:28:12.023,00:28:14.442,"-We can protect ourselves, Miss Page. -No, you can't. Not from them."
00:28:14.525,00:28:15.526,-Miss Page-- -No.
00:28:15.610,00:28:27.622,"-We can't let you go home. -Please, just-- She can stay with me."
00:28:27.705,00:28:30.166,"Just for tonight, until we figure something out."
00:28:32.753,00:28:34.545,"I'll keep you safe, Karen."
00:28:42.721,00:28:46.391,"I don't have much in the way of food, but there's a Thai place on the corner."
00:28:47.683,00:28:50.645,"If we order now, it should get here by the time I make up the bedroom for you."
00:28:50.729,00:28:52.688,It's a little dark in here.
00:28:52.773,00:28:54.107,I never...
00:28:54.190,00:28:56.943,"Uh, light switch is on the wall to your left."
00:28:59.946,00:29:01.447,"Uh, no, I'm not..."
00:29:03.158,00:29:05.326,"Would you have a shirt I could borrow, maybe?"
00:29:05.410,00:29:08.538,"This one's a little wet, and I'm a Hellions fan."
00:29:11.124,00:29:13.794,Let me grab something for you.
00:29:13.877,00:29:15.628,"And, really, I can't put you out of your bedroom."
00:29:15.711,00:29:17.255,I'll be just fine on the couch.
00:29:17.338,00:29:22.761,"From what I understand about my living room, that might not be true."
00:29:34.022,00:29:35.440,Holy shit!
00:29:38.693,00:29:44.115,"I'm told the co-op nearly rioted, some oversight from the developer's agreement."
00:29:46.284,00:29:49.788,"Upside is, nobody wanted it and I got a corner apartment at a hell of a discount."
00:29:56.044,00:29:57.253,Thanks.
00:30:10.141,00:30:12.393,Can I ask a personal question?
00:30:14.938,00:30:16.772,I haven't always been blind.
00:30:16.857,00:30:19.943,I guess that's what everyone wants to know.
00:30:20.026,00:30:22.653,"That or, How do you comb your hair?"
00:30:22.737,00:30:24.655,How do you comb your hair?
00:30:25.698,00:30:27.742,"Honestly, you just-- You hope for the best."
00:30:29.452,00:30:30.786,Thank you.
00:30:34.624,00:30:36.126,You wanna sit?
00:30:38.419,00:30:40.088,How did it happen?
00:30:41.965,00:30:43.424,Car accident.
00:30:44.342,00:30:45.844,When I was nine.
00:30:45.927,00:30:47.387,Must have been rough.
00:30:47.470,00:30:50.098,No. I made it through.
00:30:51.599,00:30:55.436,Do you remember what it was like...
00:30:55.520,00:30:57.605,To... To see?
00:30:59.232,00:31:00.316,"I, um..."
00:31:01.734,00:31:03.361,"Yes, I remember."
00:31:04.029,00:31:06.697,I can't imagine what that must be like.
00:31:10.451,00:31:13.454,"You know, I'm supposed to say I don't miss it."
00:31:15.123,00:31:17.083,That's what they teach you in trauma recovery.
00:31:17.167,00:31:23.298,"Define yourself by what you have, value the differences, make no apologies for what you lack."
00:31:25.466,00:31:28.053,"And it's all true, for the most part..."
00:31:32.432,00:31:34.850,but it doesn't change the fact that I...
00:31:35.768,00:31:38.813,I'd give anything to see the sky one more time.
00:31:45.820,00:31:48.698,Do you mind if I ask you some questions now?
00:31:55.496,00:31:56.539,Uh...
00:31:56.622,00:31:58.041,"-Go ahead. -You just nodded, right?"
00:31:59.960,00:32:01.544,"Uh, yeah."
00:32:01.627,00:32:02.753,Okay.
00:32:05.631,00:32:07.926,Here's what I don't understand.
00:32:11.429,00:32:19.395,I'm the man in charge of the pension funds and I find out one of my secretaries has discovered my illicit activity.
00:32:19.479,00:32:23.108,"To make matters worse, she's now telling people about said activity."
00:32:23.191,00:32:25.110,"Which, obviously, I can't have."
00:32:25.193,00:32:27.820,So I decide to take action.
00:32:30.406,00:32:31.866,But why don't I kill you?
00:32:32.993,00:32:34.119,They tried.
00:32:34.744,00:32:36.662,"Yeah, the second time. In the jail."
00:32:36.746,00:32:39.707,"But the first time, they left you alive. Why?"
00:32:41.960,00:32:44.379,What were they trying to do? Frame you?
00:32:45.755,00:32:49.384,"Now, the second time, maybe that's a change of plan."
00:32:49.467,00:32:53.263,"Something doesn't go their way, something sloppy at the crime scene."
00:32:53.346,00:32:56.349,Two lawyers show up out of the blue before their people can get to you.
00:32:57.892,00:33:02.897,"So they figure, okay, maybe Karen hangs herself in her cell, and this thing gets swept under the rug."
00:33:03.814,00:33:05.608,But the first time...
00:33:07.318,00:33:08.861,"The first time, they're not trying to kill you."
00:33:08.944,00:33:11.697,They're trying to discredit you. They're trying to scare you.
00:33:11.781,00:33:14.617,And the only reason that they would do that...
00:33:15.576,00:33:18.329,is if you have something that they want.
00:33:21.791,00:33:26.629,"So, I've been trying to think about what that could be, and the only thing I've come up with..."
00:33:28.631,00:33:31.009,...is the Union Allied pension file.
00:33:35.013,00:33:36.847,"Did you keep the file, Karen?"
00:33:40.768,00:33:42.228,No.
00:33:45.273,00:33:48.234,"As soon as I asked my boss about it, he took it away from me."
00:33:50.611,00:33:54.324,"The IT guys, they came and they wiped the computers."
00:33:55.033,00:33:59.829,"Believe me, a part of me wishes I'd made a copy for myself..."
00:34:01.956,00:34:04.125,but I guess I'm just not that smart.
00:34:06.211,00:34:08.588,"Ah, well, it was just a thought."
00:34:26.606,00:34:29.317,It's freezing this high up.
00:34:29.400,00:34:31.444,Next time we're meeting at Per Se.
00:34:32.653,00:34:34.572,I'll domesticate you boys yet.
00:34:34.655,00:34:37.783,"This would be a balmy day in Samara, Leland."
00:34:37.867,00:34:42.622,"Yes, it's perfect Chechnyans-kidnap- a-preschool weather, Vladimir."
00:34:46.709,00:34:50.630,Can you at least pretend to be cold? It's unsettling.
00:35:00.556,00:35:02.392,Anyone here speak Chinese?
00:35:03.976,00:35:05.436,Nobu?
00:35:06.562,00:35:08.231,The man is Japanese.
00:35:08.314,00:35:10.816,"I know, I know. I just thought that..."
00:35:11.734,00:35:12.902,Forget it.
00:35:20.826,00:35:23.371,"Oh, please tell me he's right behind you."
00:35:23.454,00:35:26.916,"Unfortunately, my employer is attending to other matters."
00:35:26.999,00:35:30.836,"He apologizes to you in particular, Madame Gao."
00:35:33.256,00:35:35.425,We do not deal with lap dogs.
00:35:35.508,00:35:39.512,Tell Mister-- We don't say his name.
00:35:42.932,00:35:44.099,"Woof, woof."
00:35:52.442,00:35:54.527,There was a problem on the docks.
00:35:55.653,00:36:00.283,Barrett and our men were attacked. Some moodak in a black mask.
00:36:04.829,00:36:08.040,"Fine, we'll go with the man-in-black story."
00:36:08.123,00:36:11.126,Our men would not lie.
00:36:11.211,00:36:12.920,I said I'm on board.
00:36:14.964,00:36:18.176,I'm glad to hear there's some new blood running around out there.
00:36:18.259,00:36:23.848,Heroes and their consequences are why we have our current opportunities.
00:36:24.765,00:36:30.230,Now can we review the latest numbers and-- Tell me more about this man.
00:36:30.313,00:36:34.192,Took Barrett and our guys out while they were loading the container.
00:36:46.036,00:36:49.207,She wants to know if this man stole the shipment for himself.
00:36:50.124,00:36:51.166,No.
00:36:52.585,00:36:54.128,He let the women go.
00:36:55.463,00:36:58.173,He took out your men. How?
00:36:58.841,00:37:00.009,Caught them by surprise.
00:37:00.926,00:37:01.927,Beat them.
00:37:02.595,00:37:05.306,-With his bare hands. -Four men with his bare hands?
00:37:05.390,00:37:08.017,That is what we were told.
00:37:08.518,00:37:11.020,Perhaps you should have been there yourself.
00:37:15.441,00:37:20.446,"Every time one of these guys punches someone through a building, our margins go up 3%."
00:37:20.530,00:37:21.572,We should be celebrating.
00:37:21.656,00:37:22.865,This is different.
00:37:22.948,00:37:24.659,My employer will be...
00:37:25.826,00:37:26.952,displeased...
00:37:27.870,00:37:30.915,we're being inconvenienced by a lone vigilante.
00:37:30.998,00:37:33.251,Then he should tell me to my face.
00:37:35.295,00:37:38.506,This is on you. Deal with it. Quietly.
00:37:38.589,00:37:40.758,"We must be quiet, yes."
00:37:41.759,00:37:45.680,"We would not want another Union Allied situation, would we?"
00:37:45.763,00:37:48.933,"Big, loud, lot of questions."
00:37:49.016,00:37:50.268,We're handling it.
00:37:50.351,00:37:52.978,Like you keep saying you're handling Prohaszka?
00:37:53.062,00:37:55.064,We're in the process of negotiating with Mr. Prohaszka.
00:37:55.147,00:37:56.732,Negotiating?
00:37:56.816,00:37:59.444,Maybe we handle our problem same way.
00:37:59.527,00:38:01.904,"Sit down with this man in black, break bread."
00:38:01.987,00:38:11.831,I think what Anatoly's trying to say is that it would be in our best interests for Union Allied to be tidied up as expeditiously as possible.
00:38:11.914,00:38:13.624,As I said...
00:38:16.294,00:38:17.962,we're handling it.
00:41:36.994,00:41:38.120,Hey.
00:41:38.829,00:41:40.581,"Let's go, finish up."
00:41:47.254,00:41:48.798,"I'm tired, Dad."
00:41:50.800,00:41:54.469,"Hey, I don't want you to end up like your old man."
00:41:56.764,00:41:58.348,I never studied.
00:42:00.350,00:42:02.144,Look where it got me.
00:42:40.975,00:42:44.729,"Come on, Matty. Get to work."
00:44:49.770,00:44:51.063,Who...
00:44:55.860,00:44:57.527,What the hell?
00:44:58.653,00:45:01.198,I'll get this into the right hands.
00:45:01.281,00:45:02.742,"No, you can't."
00:45:03.743,00:45:07.287,You can't take it to the police. You can't trust anyone.
00:45:09.289,00:45:11.041,Then we tell everyone.
00:45:25.597,00:45:28.642,DNA evidence will put Rance at the murder scene.
00:45:28.725,00:45:32.187,"B and E gone sideways, his records altered in support."
00:45:32.271,00:45:36.525,Mr. Farnum's bail has been arranged for through the usual channels.
00:45:36.608,00:45:41.613,Leland's to cover our exposure on the financials and McClintock takes the fall for Union Allied.
00:45:45.034,00:45:46.410,Pills.
00:45:46.493,00:45:49.704,He overdosed less than an hour ago.
00:45:49.789,00:45:52.291,The remaining concerns will be attended to shortly.
00:45:52.374,00:45:55.335,Rance was a professional. How was he subdued?
00:45:57.504,00:45:58.881,I'm looking into it.
00:45:58.964,00:46:01.341,What about the girl?
00:46:01.425,00:46:04.428,"Should I make the appropriate arrangements for her, along with the others?"
00:46:04.511,00:46:07.807,No. Everything she knows is already in the papers.
00:46:07.890,00:46:10.935,"Her lawyers, Nelson and Murdock."
00:46:11.018,00:46:13.854,Ambulance chasers. They're clean.
00:46:13.938,00:46:16.190,Start a file. They may be of use.
00:46:17.274,00:46:18.650,Understood.
00:46:23.780,00:46:24.865,...in the way of repayment.
00:46:24.949,00:46:30.996,"But it is, um, my grandmother's recipe, and she made me promise only to serve it to my future husband."
00:46:32.289,00:46:34.834,"You know, it's, like, filled with virtue or something."
00:46:34.917,00:46:37.878,I thought I detected a whiff of virtue in there.
00:46:37.962,00:46:41.340,"Not that I'm complaining, but you really should be thanking the nut in the mask."
00:46:41.423,00:46:42.799,He's not a nut.
00:46:44.009,00:46:46.511,"-I mean, he's a little weird, maybe-- -We're just glad you're okay."
00:46:48.973,00:46:52.184,"Well, if it weren't for you two, I'd still be in that cell."
00:46:52.267,00:46:53.518,Hmm.
00:46:53.602,00:46:58.190,Job's easy when your client's innocent. All you did was tell the truth.
00:46:59.691,00:47:01.276,"Yeah, but you listened."
00:47:06.115,00:47:09.659,"Oh, and don't get us wrong, we're still gonna bill you."
00:47:09.743,00:47:12.496,Just as soon as we figure out how to make bills.
00:47:13.663,00:47:16.208,I did notice that you could use some help around here.
00:47:16.291,00:47:18.668,And I owe you.
00:47:18.752,00:47:20.754,Maybe I could clean the place up a bit.
00:47:21.964,00:47:23.215,Is this place messy?
00:47:24.133,00:47:27.719,"Our firm is very prestigious and discerning, Miss Page."
00:47:27.802,00:47:34.601,"Do you have any prior experience Uh, no, but..."
00:47:35.519,00:47:36.937,I'll work for free.
00:47:53.370,00:47:55.580,You can leave the lights off.
00:50:39.411,00:50:40.495,Hey! Come on!
00:50:52.006,00:50:53.425,Ahh! Daddy!
00:50:53.508,00:50:54.634,Daddy!
00:50:55.802,00:50:57.346,No! Daddy!
00:51:26.958,00:51:28.210,Help!
00:51:28.293,00:51:29.669,Daddy!
00:00:32.449,00:00:33.991,Hi.
00:00:34.076,00:00:36.994,Can I get a size 10 and a lane?
00:00:37.079,00:00:39.081,Sorry. We're closing up.
00:00:41.333,00:00:42.500,He's still playing.
00:00:42.584,00:00:45.462,Mr. Prohaszka bowls when he wants to. Worked it out with the owner.
00:00:46.463,00:00:48.005,Can I join him for a few balls?
00:00:48.090,00:00:49.882,"You wanna ask, knock yourself out."
00:00:50.467,00:00:51.884,Be right back.
00:00:55.430,00:00:56.806,Excuse me.
00:00:58.475,00:01:01.144,I was just wondering if maybe I could join you for a couple games?
00:01:01.228,00:01:03.396,-Private game. You mind? -No.
00:01:03.480,00:01:06.441,Hey... sorry.
00:01:06.524,00:01:09.361,I was just really looking forward to throwing a few balls.
00:01:09.444,00:01:11.154,Get this moron out of my face.
00:01:13.030,00:01:14.449,"Hey, come on."
00:01:23.583,00:01:25.168,"You got a bad attitude, friend."
00:01:35.303,00:01:36.513,Mmm.
00:01:40.808,00:01:42.269,Love that smell.
00:01:42.810,00:01:44.312,Metal and oil.
00:01:45.605,00:01:47.982,"Fresh, never been fired."
00:01:48.900,00:01:50.026,Take a whiff.
00:01:52.945,00:01:54.447,Like a good revolver better.
00:01:55.865,00:01:57.117,No chance of jamming up.
00:01:58.034,00:01:59.744,Man.
00:01:59.827,00:02:00.828,Look at this.
00:02:00.912,00:02:03.165,This is top of the line.
00:02:03.248,00:02:08.128,I guarantee this baby will not jam or my name ain't Turk Barrett.
00:02:14.967,00:02:16.886,"This is how he negotiates, huh?"
00:03:00.388,00:03:01.598,Hello?
00:03:43.723,00:03:45.350,"Dispatch, Victor 23..."
00:03:45.433,00:03:47.059,I want a lawyer.
00:05:08.600,00:05:10.977,It's all right. Seal of Confession.
00:05:12.186,00:05:16.023,Anything you said during the sacrament of penance stays between us.
00:05:16.858,00:05:19.944,"Could've killed 10 people, I couldn't tell anyone."
00:05:20.027,00:05:21.363,That seem fair to you?
00:05:21.446,00:05:23.155,Is what it is.
00:05:27.034,00:05:30.079,"-I have to get to work. -Yeah, me, too."
00:05:30.162,00:05:32.665,"Wouldn't mind a cup of coffee first, though."
00:05:32.749,00:05:39.797,Chamber of commerce donated one of those... fancy espresso machines for meetings and stuff.
00:05:39.881,00:05:42.925,"I make a heck of a latte, if you're interested."
00:05:45.970,00:05:47.805,"Some other time, maybe."
00:05:50.433,00:05:55.104,Seemed you had a lot on your mind last time you were here.
00:05:57.482,00:05:59.776,Sure you don't want that latte?
00:06:01.027,00:06:02.779,"Take care of yourself, Father."
00:06:37.647,00:06:41.067,People's memories these days ain't so good.
00:06:41.859,00:06:46.238,"Back in the day, I couldn't wait to see this view."
00:06:46.322,00:06:50.201,"Me and the boys, driving in Friday nights."
00:06:52.454,00:06:54.956,Kings of the castle.
00:06:55.039,00:06:57.625,Kings don't have bodies in the trunk.
00:06:57.709,00:06:59.502,Tell that to Macbeth.
00:07:01.463,00:07:03.798,What's this about you moving to Florida?
00:07:04.674,00:07:06.300,Did you hear about Rigoletto?
00:07:06.383,00:07:07.635,Heard he retired.
00:07:07.719,00:07:10.763,Yeah... in pieces.
00:07:15.101,00:07:17.812,-Somebody putting it to you? -You know the rules.
00:07:19.731,00:07:22.859,-Is it the Russians? -The rules.
00:07:22.942,00:07:27.489,You go first... and then maybe I got something to say.
00:07:27.572,00:07:29.699,That's the way it's always been.
00:07:32.869,00:07:35.204,Russians got a bee up their ass.
00:07:35.287,00:07:37.499,Somebody's been hitting them... hard.
00:07:37.582,00:07:39.709,Mostly around the docks.
00:07:39.792,00:07:42.670,"Wasn't Rigoletto, that what you're thinking."
00:07:44.547,00:07:46.758,So who are we looking at?
00:07:48.134,00:07:49.636,You tell me.
00:07:52.179,00:07:54.306,I don't know.
00:07:54.390,00:07:56.726,Been scratching at it.
00:07:56.809,00:07:59.562,"Police reports get altered. Public records, too."
00:08:00.938,00:08:03.816,But I know a pattern when it shoves a thumb in my eye.
00:08:03.900,00:08:06.528,"A new player, maybe?"
00:08:06.611,00:08:10.657,"Used to be if you killed a man, you sent his wife flowers."
00:08:10.740,00:08:13.868,Now they just send his wife with him.
00:08:19.916,00:08:21.458,"You know something, don't you?"
00:08:21.543,00:08:22.544,Yeah.
00:08:23.085,00:08:25.922,Florida's beautiful this time of year.
00:08:31.511,00:08:32.845,The rules.
00:08:32.929,00:08:35.765,"There are no rules, Benny. Not anymore."
00:08:37.892,00:08:39.351,So that's it?
00:08:40.520,00:08:42.897,That's all I get?
00:08:42.980,00:08:50.154,"You know, when I went away to do my 10, every newspaper in town dragged my name through the shit."
00:08:50.237,00:08:51.948,You were the only one who did it...
00:08:53.658,00:08:56.452,without mentioning my kids.
00:08:59.288,00:09:01.457,Always grateful for that.
00:09:03.084,00:09:04.752,Then give me something.
00:09:04.836,00:09:07.463,A name... anything.
00:09:08.548,00:09:11.593,"Take a pass on this one, Benny."
00:09:11.676,00:09:14.011,Some fights will just get you bloody.
00:09:40.496,00:09:42.373,"You know the whole, Let's stay out all night, thing?"
00:09:42.456,00:09:43.875,Yeah.
00:09:43.958,00:09:46.210,How about next time we skip the part with the eel?
00:09:48.004,00:09:50.297,"Hey, what do you think about getting a sign on the door?"
00:09:50.381,00:09:52.759,"-Well, you got a sign. -A real one."
00:09:55.386,00:09:57.346,Just one little sign. What could it cost?
00:09:57.429,00:09:59.056,"Frank, you can barely afford to pay me."
00:09:59.140,00:10:00.808,I thought you were working for free.
00:10:00.892,00:10:04.646,I... I did... for a day.
00:10:06.397,00:10:09.901,-Hey... you know she's not really free? -Hey.
00:10:12.569,00:10:15.406,"-Oh. Are you okay? -Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine."
00:10:15.489,00:10:18.242,I just wasn't paying attention last night. It's my fault.
00:10:18.325,00:10:19.368,You need a dog.
00:10:21.746,00:10:23.289,You don't like dogs? Who doesn't like dogs?
00:10:23.372,00:10:24.456,I... I love dogs.
00:10:29.671,00:10:31.881,Was that a knock?
00:10:32.882,00:10:34.008,Someone's at the door.
00:10:34.091,00:10:35.467,Our door?
00:10:35.551,00:10:36.552,Uh...
00:10:37.344,00:10:38.345,Karen?
00:10:40.973,00:10:42.308,Right.
00:10:42.391,00:10:43.517,Okay.
00:10:48.564,00:10:49.565,Hi.
00:10:51.567,00:10:53.069,Do you do walk-ins?
00:10:56.363,00:11:00.201,"diversified interests in the private sector, both domestic and international."
00:11:00.284,00:11:04.538,"From time to time, we scout the landscape for promising talent to put on retainer."
00:11:07.834,00:11:09.752,"Why not a larger firm, Mr., uh..."
00:11:09.836,00:11:12.213,Confederated Global Investments is my employer.
00:11:12.296,00:11:14.131,It's not what I was asking.
00:11:18.594,00:11:19.595,Oh.
00:11:20.471,00:11:21.472,"So, why us?"
00:11:21.555,00:11:29.396,"Obviously, the larger firms aren't able to provide the same hands-on attention that we pride ourselves on at Nelson and Murdock."
00:11:31.232,00:11:41.367,"I'm here because my employer does extensive business in Hell's Kitchen, and who knows it better than two local boys who graduated from Columbia Law, cum laude and summa cum laude?"
00:11:41.450,00:11:43.369,"Uh, the summa part is politics."
00:11:44.703,00:11:53.129,You set up shop right here in your backyard despite the fact that both of you were made a very lucrative offer from Landman and Zack in Manhattan where you interned.
00:11:53.212,00:11:54.463,You've done your homework.
00:11:54.546,00:11:56.423,My employer expects no less.
00:11:56.507,00:11:58.760,Then forgive me for being blunt.
00:12:00.845,00:12:03.639,"In my line of work, I find it refreshing."
00:12:03.722,00:12:05.266,What is that line of work exactly?
00:12:05.349,00:12:13.690,"What my partner is trying to say is we're still building a practice, so we're very particular about our clientele."
00:12:13.775,00:12:20.990,"I assure you, all my employer wants is for you to continue to be ethical, decent men..."
00:12:21.073,00:12:22.574,good lawyers.
00:12:22.658,00:12:27.454,"And for that, for nothing more than your exceptional skills and your discretion..."
00:12:29.791,00:12:32.001,you'll be fairly compensated.
00:12:43.429,00:12:45.431,It's... It's fair. That's... That's fair.
00:12:46.265,00:12:48.309,Your partner doesn't seem convinced.
00:12:49.226,00:12:52.521,"Like Foggy said, we're particular about our clientele."
00:12:55.817,00:12:58.861,I'm curious about your... clientele.
00:12:58.945,00:13:04.491,Do they all end up working for you after you get them off for murder or just the pretty ones?
00:13:07.954,00:13:09.663,"You, uh, give us a minute, please?"
00:13:11.623,00:13:12.624,Um...
00:13:22.426,00:13:25.012,I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset anyone.
00:13:25.096,00:13:27.723,How did you know about Miss Page's situation?
00:13:27.806,00:13:29.225,She was never charged.
00:13:29.308,00:13:30.476,There was nothing in the papers.
00:13:31.978,00:13:33.645,I hear I'm not the only one.
00:13:34.396,00:13:36.858,I think we might be veering off the subject.
00:13:36.941,00:13:38.860,"I understand your concerns, Mr. Murdock."
00:13:38.943,00:13:42.446,Perhaps... you should review one of our cases...
00:13:42.529,00:13:43.865,before you make a decision?
00:13:43.948,00:13:45.282,Peace of mind and whatnot.
00:13:45.366,00:13:47.743,That's a fantastic idea.
00:13:47.826,00:13:49.078,Matthew?
00:13:50.079,00:13:51.914,"Yeah, what harm could it do?"
00:13:51.998,00:13:54.000,Excellent.
00:13:54.083,00:13:58.963,You have... 38 minutes to get to Precinct 15.
00:14:03.175,00:14:05.719,Everything you need is in this file.
00:14:10.892,00:14:12.101,Thank you for your time.
00:14:12.184,00:14:14.270,No. Thank you.
00:14:18.315,00:14:19.691,What is your problem?
00:14:19.775,00:14:21.068,"He wouldn't even give us his name, Foggy."
00:14:21.152,00:14:23.529,You wouldn't care if you could see the zeroes on this check.
00:14:23.612,00:14:25.781,"-Yeah, maybe you would if you couldn't. -We're running out of time."
00:14:27.408,00:14:29.035,The hell are you going?
00:14:29.118,00:14:30.119,Matt!
00:15:42.066,00:15:43.484,In your own words.
00:15:44.151,00:15:46.612,All I wanted was to throw a few balls.
00:15:46.695,00:15:48.739,The lady at the shoe counter will tell you the same.
00:15:48.822,00:15:53.494,She also says that you crushed the deceased's skull with a bowling ball.
00:15:53.577,00:15:55.329,Self-defense.
00:15:55.412,00:15:59.333,"The man and his... whatever they were, they threatened my life."
00:16:00.751,00:16:02.086,They threatened you how?
00:16:02.169,00:16:03.879,Verbally? Physically?
00:16:04.505,00:16:05.881,Which sounds better?
00:16:07.091,00:16:08.259,Excuse me?
00:16:09.635,00:16:12.221,They threatened me both verbally and physically.
00:16:18.477,00:16:27.736,So... you say you... didn't know or have never met Mr... Prohaszka -prior to last night? -No...
00:16:27.819,00:16:32.949,but I do regret any injurious consequences my actions may have caused.
00:16:35.244,00:16:38.830,"You have quite the legal vocabulary, Mr. Healy."
00:16:38.914,00:16:41.792,Am I right in assuming this isn't your first rodeo?
00:16:42.876,00:16:44.336,I had issues.
00:16:47.131,00:16:48.674,I'm better now.
00:16:53.095,00:16:56.640,"On second thought... Mr. Healy, uh..."
00:16:56.723,00:16:59.018,perhaps our firm isn't the right fit for you.
00:17:00.811,00:17:01.853,"Uh, no, no, that's..."
00:17:01.937,00:17:05.107,"I was just explaining to Mr. Healy that, uh..."
00:17:05.191,00:17:08.777,"we have a full caseload right now, so we-- We'd be happy to represent you, Mr. Healy."
00:17:08.860,00:17:10.779,-What? -We're taking the case.
00:17:12.656,00:17:15.284,Why don't we start from the beginning? Tell me everything you know.
00:17:17.203,00:17:25.001,"I understand the policy has an allotment of days, but last time we spoke, I was told I could request an extension."
00:17:33.469,00:17:35.221,What's the new form called?
00:17:37.931,00:17:39.015,From the website.
00:17:39.100,00:17:41.518,Of course. Thanks.
00:17:44.563,00:17:46.482,Insurance talk?
00:17:46.565,00:17:48.109,It's the worst.
00:17:48.192,00:17:50.319,"I remember, uh, with my kids and the dentist."
00:17:50.402,00:17:51.612,Yeah.
00:17:51.695,00:17:55.366,Yeah. Got a minute to talk about next week's spread?
00:17:55.449,00:17:56.700,Already working on it.
00:17:56.783,00:17:58.660,Another organized crime thing?
00:17:59.661,00:18:01.872,All of Hell's Kitchen.
00:18:02.706,00:18:06.543,There's a new player on the scene. No one knows who it is or what they want.
00:18:06.627,00:18:08.420,Everybody's scrambling.
00:18:08.504,00:18:10.172,"Your assignment's the city desk, Ben."
00:18:10.256,00:18:12.758,This is the city. No one else is on this yet.
00:18:12.841,00:18:14.676,I'm the only one who sees it.
00:18:14.760,00:18:15.802,It's not sexy.
00:18:15.886,00:18:18.805,"We're a newspaper, Ellison, not a girlie mag."
00:18:18.889,00:18:21.725,"You know that's not what I meant, and nobody calls them that anymore."
00:18:22.643,00:18:24.186,It's not just the Russians.
00:18:24.270,00:18:28.023,I think maybe the Union Allied scandal might tie into this.
00:18:28.107,00:18:31.818,"Right, and you remember what that exposé did for circulation?"
00:18:31.902,00:18:33.820,"Dick with a side of, Who gives a shit?"
00:18:33.904,00:18:35.572,This is a real story.
00:18:35.656,00:18:37.783,"Yeah, and it's gonna end the same as it always does, right?"
00:18:37.866,00:18:40.911,A bunch of fat old guys in some white-collar prison with more fat old guys.
00:18:40.994,00:18:44.790,The cops aren't even on this yet. We could be the ones to connect the dots.
00:18:44.873,00:18:47.959,"It doesn't sell papers, Ben."
00:18:48.043,00:18:50.421,Not anymore.
00:18:53.507,00:18:56.051,I want you on the subway line piece.
00:19:00.347,00:19:01.557,Rumors bubbling.
00:19:01.640,00:19:05.144,Will Hell's Kitchen finally get a subway line?
00:19:05.227,00:19:07.479,"Come on, we tell that every year."
00:19:07.563,00:19:09.731,"-And every year, it kills. -For a fluff piece."
00:19:09.815,00:19:12.276,"You know, you like to be on the ground, right?"
00:19:12.359,00:19:14.528,You like to talk to people. Take a poll.
00:19:15.946,00:19:16.988,What color do they like?
00:19:17.072,00:19:18.740,"You know, we got a blue line, we got a yellow line."
00:19:18.824,00:19:19.825,We're running out of colors.
00:19:19.908,00:19:21.452,Like M&amp;M's?
00:19:21.535,00:19:23.287,"Yeah, see? You'll write the hell out of it."
00:19:25.289,00:19:30.669,There used to be a time when the people in this building wrote the hell out of the news.
00:19:32.546,00:19:40.095,"Everybody we know... is making twice what we are writing for blogs, working from home in their underwear."
00:19:41.930,00:19:44.808,"We're hanging on by our fingertips, Ben."
00:19:44.891,00:19:47.186,You really want to be greasing that ledge?
00:19:53.900,00:19:55.444,"Make it visual, all right?"
00:19:55.527,00:19:59.448,"I'll call down to Graphics, see if I can drum up a chart."
00:20:00.449,00:20:02.701,"Oh, and, um..."
00:20:02.784,00:20:06.872,"I'll put in a call to the insurance drones, see what I can do, okay?"
00:20:20.051,00:20:23.930,"Would you like us to reiterate the terms of attorney-client privilege, Mr. Healy?"
00:20:24.014,00:20:26.182,Think I got it.
00:20:26.267,00:20:29.811,Then you know anything you tell us stays in this room.
00:20:29.895,00:20:30.979,Just like church.
00:20:37.944,00:20:39.154,That a question?
00:20:39.238,00:20:40.447,Statement.
00:20:40.531,00:20:44.034,It's not every day a global investment firm picks up the tab for a murder suspect.
00:20:44.117,00:20:45.702,Self-defense.
00:20:46.703,00:20:49.581,I wonder if you could shed some light on the man that hired us to represent you.
00:20:49.665,00:20:51.708,"-Don't think I can, counselor. -Can't or you won't?"
00:20:51.792,00:20:54.628,Maybe we should focus on details pertinent to the case?
00:20:54.711,00:21:00.634,"Just trying to build a solid defense, and the connection between Mr. Healy and the man that came to our offices might just help prove his innocence."
00:21:00.717,00:21:01.885,How?
00:21:02.928,00:21:06.348,Maybe they're old friends. Maybe he's a character witness.
00:21:06.432,00:21:10.311,Or maybe you were in his employment at the time of the incident.
00:21:10.394,00:21:12.813,"I just wanted to throw a few balls, just like I keep saying."
00:21:12.896,00:21:14.606,"You go bowling often, Mr. Healy?"
00:21:15.231,00:21:16.650,When the mood hits.
00:21:16.733,00:21:19.152,"And the deceased, he had no motive that you recall?"
00:21:20.904,00:21:21.988,No.
00:21:22.072,00:21:24.700,You didn't provoke him intentionally or otherwise?
00:21:24.783,00:21:26.952,Are we breaking for lunch anytime soon?
00:21:27.453,00:21:30.456,"Are you at all afraid of what might happen if we lose this case, Mr. Healy?"
00:21:31.832,00:21:32.874,No.
00:21:35.502,00:21:36.587,Are you?
00:21:39.840,00:21:41.508,"Matt, a word, please?"
00:21:51.810,00:21:53.186,We should not be doing this.
00:21:53.269,00:21:55.146,-Doing what? -Defending professional criminals.
00:21:55.230,00:21:57.023,You're the one that keeps saying we need real clients.
00:21:57.107,00:22:01.027,That's not a client. It's a shark in a skin suit.
00:22:01.111,00:22:02.446,You pegged it back at the office.
00:22:02.529,00:22:04.030,There's something off about this whole thing.
00:22:04.114,00:22:05.324,"We agreed to represent him, Foggy."
00:22:05.407,00:22:08.619,We're gonna try this case and let the jury take it from there.
00:22:08.702,00:22:10.245,Mr. Healy...
00:22:13.457,00:22:19.463,"I suggest we waive criminal procedure law 180.80, give the DA more time to explore a plea."
00:22:19.546,00:22:23.842,"In the meantime, the best thing for you to do is to be forthcoming with us."
00:22:23.925,00:22:29.473,"Together, we'll confront the charges honestly, openly and within the moral confines of the law."
00:22:29.556,00:22:30.891,Does that sound good to you?
00:22:32.183,00:22:33.309,No.
00:22:33.394,00:22:36.271,-Excuse me? -I want the 180.80 date.
00:22:36.938,00:22:43.361,"If I'm indicted, which we know I will be, we'll waive all hearings and discovery and go directly to trial."
00:22:45.238,00:22:47.365,"Not my first rodeo, remember?"
00:22:47.949,00:22:49.284,You'll need to testify.
00:22:49.367,00:22:52.538,I'm just gonna have faith in our judicial system...
00:22:53.830,00:22:55.832,and you're gonna do your jobs.
00:22:57.584,00:22:59.628,-That simple? -That simple.
00:22:59.711,00:23:01.713,"And, uh..."
00:23:01.797,00:23:04.800,as for the man who hired you...
00:23:04.883,00:23:07.511,all you need to know is...
00:23:07.594,00:23:09.555,his check's gonna clear.
00:23:30.826,00:23:32.368,"Wait your turn, man."
00:23:47.509,00:23:48.969,I got next.
00:24:01.439,00:24:02.816,-Hi. -Hi.
00:24:09.656,00:24:17.205,First you decide we're taking the case unilaterally and then you cross-examine the guy like we're playing bad cop/worse cop.
00:24:17.288,00:24:19.833,"If we want to keep the lights on, we gotta take some cases for the money."
00:24:19.916,00:24:21.251,You were right about that.
00:24:21.334,00:24:25.046,"Okay, for the record, this is the first time you've ever said I was right."
00:24:25.130,00:24:26.214,I hate it.
00:24:26.297,00:24:28.592,"Sometimes, we have to do things we aren't proud of."
00:24:28.675,00:24:32.721,"Yeah, but... this can't become what we do."
00:24:34.305,00:24:35.932,"Yeah, I know."
00:24:36.016,00:24:38.351,"And we have to be on the same team, making decisions together."
00:24:38.434,00:24:41.104,"I got carried away. I'm sorry, Foggy."
00:24:41.187,00:24:42.606,It's okay.
00:24:46.902,00:24:49.571,-So? -Okay.
00:24:49.655,00:25:01.917,"So assuming he's indicted, which, yeah, it's on the DA to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it wasn't self-defense, shoe girl's DD-5 says that she didn't come out of the back room until after the fight had started, which helps us."
00:25:02.000,00:25:03.043,And what about Prohaszka's men?
00:25:03.126,00:25:05.336,They lawyered up. Wouldn't give a five.
00:25:05.420,00:25:07.714,Since when do the victims of an assault not give a statement?
00:25:07.798,00:25:09.257,Another chit in our favor.
00:25:09.340,00:25:11.176,Plus Healy's pretty banged up.
00:25:11.259,00:25:15.764,"Argue defensive wounds, which makes it look more like a fight and less like an execution."
00:25:17.098,00:25:19.309,"So, you open, I'll sum up."
00:25:19.392,00:25:23.772,"And we should cash that check, have Karen see what she can find out about Confederated Global."
00:25:23.855,00:25:25.023,Right.
00:25:26.858,00:25:29.319,Where the hell is she?
00:25:32.072,00:25:42.415,"Here you agree, in writing, to never again disclose information regarding your former employer, the dissolved entity known as Union Allied Construction, or any of its affiliates."
00:25:42.498,00:25:48.755,"Upon execution of this agreement, the corporate interests, as they currently exist, agree not to pursue legal action against you."
00:25:48.839,00:25:49.840,Against me?
00:25:49.923,00:25:53.719,"Well, you signed a non-disclosure agreement the day you were hired, Miss Page."
00:25:53.802,00:25:54.803,Everybody did.
00:25:54.886,00:25:58.890,Not everyone broke that agreement and distributed confidential information.
00:25:58.974,00:26:01.768,I... I exposed criminal activity.
00:26:01.852,00:26:14.322,"And had you taken that information to any law enforcement agency, your rights may have been protected, but instead... you went to the New York Bulletin, a privately-owned news organization."
00:26:14.405,00:26:16.700,I had nothing to do with that article.
00:26:16.783,00:26:23.456,So the file you illegally removed from the premises of Union Allied wasn't the same one Mr. Urich refers to in this?
00:26:26.001,00:26:29.295,"You see how this complicates things, yes?"
00:26:31.965,00:26:41.099,"Daniel Fisher was murdered and your clients-- I assure you that any illegal activity associated with Union Allied has been dealt with, thanks very much to you."
00:26:43.434,00:26:45.603,You're welcome.
00:26:45.687,00:26:50.901,"If you'd like, you can take these to your own representatives, but I'm fairly certain they'll advise you to sign it."
00:26:50.984,00:26:56.072,"And as a show of good faith, my clients would like to offer you a lump sum of six months' salary."
00:26:56.156,00:26:57.448,For what?
00:26:57.532,00:27:02.120,For all your help in the matter and for any stress these events may have caused.
00:27:02.203,00:27:04.748,Stress?
00:27:04.831,00:27:06.207,Someone tried to kill me.
00:27:06.291,00:27:19.220,"And while my clients acknowledge no involvement with that individual or claim legal responsibility for his actions, they do feel it's their non-binding moral obligation to offer you a chance at rebuilding your life."
00:27:21.389,00:27:25.518,As long as I keep my mouth shut?
00:27:25.601,00:27:27.603,"It's a clean slate, Miss Page..."
00:27:29.480,00:27:31.983,a chance to put it all behind you.
00:27:34.110,00:27:36.988,"Now, isn't that what you want?"
00:27:47.207,00:27:50.752,"Private rooms are hard to come by, Ben. Especially this time of year."
00:27:50.836,00:27:53.046,She can't be in a communal. She needs hands-on.
00:27:53.129,00:27:56.299,"Yeah, well, you are lucky after all this time that they are still covering you at all."
00:27:56.382,00:27:58.844,"They said, in some cases, it's possible to get an extension."
00:28:01.722,00:28:02.973,I already filled out the forms.
00:28:03.056,00:28:05.308,I just need you to approve them.
00:28:05.391,00:28:07.518,"Yeah, okay. This is the first step."
00:28:07.602,00:28:10.188,"There are 1,000 more after this, and I've got a hospital to run."
00:28:10.271,00:28:14.860,"If I stop to fill out every appeal, I am going to be-- They're gonna cut her off, Shirley."
00:28:14.943,00:28:16.987,It's not her fault.
00:28:18.238,00:28:20.448,Come with me.
00:28:20.531,00:28:23.827,It is not like we are throwing her out on the street.
00:28:25.536,00:28:31.752,"But the next thing you know, the communal ward is at capacity, then she gets pushed to an out-patient facility."
00:28:32.377,00:28:35.213,"I know there's a limit to what you can do, to what I can afford."
00:28:35.296,00:28:40.260,"I just want to make sure she can rest, so she can get better..."
00:28:40.343,00:28:42.428,so she can come home.
00:28:49.227,00:28:50.353,Okay.
00:28:53.398,00:28:56.401,Five days. That's what this will buy you.
00:28:59.738,00:29:01.614,"-And the appeal? -No promises, okay?"
00:29:01.697,00:29:10.957,Now get the hell out of my office. I have got a measle outbreak to deal with because idiot parents don't want to vaccinate and my best nurse is out with who the hell knows what.
00:29:11.041,00:29:12.417,Uh...
00:29:12.500,00:29:13.709,What's that?
00:29:13.794,00:29:15.461,Cheese blintz from that place you like.
00:29:15.545,00:29:18.214,-You should have led with that. -That'd be cheating.
00:29:18.298,00:29:19.841,Yeah.
00:29:38.651,00:29:41.279,-Hey. She had a good day. -Yeah?
00:29:41.362,00:29:44.825,She was up half an hour. Asked about you.
00:30:32.497,00:30:33.789,35.15.
00:30:33.874,00:30:37.418,Then we'll take our facts and fit them to the CJI and the statute.
00:30:41.464,00:30:42.465,Got the insights?
00:30:42.548,00:30:43.884,It's still loading.
00:30:44.425,00:30:47.303,-We need better Wi-Fi. -We need better everything.
00:30:47.387,00:30:48.679,Let's do that.
00:30:48.763,00:30:51.516,"Let's win cases, be popular and make money."
00:30:51.599,00:30:54.394,"-It's not about that, Foggy. -I know..."
00:30:54.936,00:30:58.356,"but it could be... just a little, a smidge."
00:31:00.650,00:31:03.028,"Hey, uh... Wi-Fi's acting weird."
00:31:03.111,00:31:05.030,You find out anything on Confed Global?
00:31:05.738,00:31:14.122,"Yeah, uh, it's a subsidiary of a holding company of a loan-out to a holding subsidiary and on and on and on."
00:31:14.205,00:31:16.707,But that dickhead's check cleared in about two seconds.
00:31:17.500,00:31:19.210,There's your money.
00:31:21.837,00:31:23.506,"Bang on the router, will you?"
00:31:25.425,00:31:28.428,"Oh, hey, no more long lunches until this is over, okay?"
00:31:29.762,00:31:31.139,You got it.
00:31:42.400,00:31:47.738,"All right, practice insights for New York State Penal Law 35.15."
00:31:50.575,00:31:58.624,"And in the state of New York, I'll remind you, that my client is not required to prove that he was justified in his actions."
00:32:08.009,00:32:13.306,And they will come nowhere close to meeting this burden.
00:32:13.389,00:32:16.684,At the end of this case...
00:32:16.767,00:32:21.481,the only verdict that you can render will be not guilty.
00:32:26.444,00:32:29.655,and I have a few additional comments that I want you to consider.
00:32:29.739,00:32:34.535,"If you should fail to agree upon a verdict, we will be forced to..."
00:33:16.452,00:33:18.746,"This will all be over soon, okay?"
00:33:18.829,00:33:21.457,Just keep it together till the verdict. Can you do that?
00:33:24.377,00:33:28.048,"Look, you ask me, it's almost like they're doing you a favor."
00:33:29.090,00:33:33.178,"I mean, you don't want something like that floating around."
00:33:35.513,00:33:38.724,Go home. Get some rest.
00:33:38.808,00:33:40.518,You got a big day tomorrow.
00:34:00.080,00:34:01.206,Stay down.
00:34:02.123,00:34:03.166,Ahhh!
00:34:03.249,00:34:04.625,I said stay down.
00:34:04.709,00:34:05.918,You son of a bitch!
00:34:07.128,00:34:09.089,What do you have on her?
00:34:12.592,00:34:14.969,"A tape! There's a tape, okay?"
00:34:15.053,00:34:16.512,What's on it?
00:34:16.596,00:34:21.101,"A mistake she made when she was 19 and pretty, something she don't want her kids to know about."
00:34:21.184,00:34:23.061,-You get rid of it. -I can't.
00:34:26.439,00:34:28.899,It won't make a difference anyway.
00:34:29.942,00:34:31.736,-Who do you work for? -I don't know.
00:34:31.819,00:34:33.738,-Ahhh! -I want a name.
00:34:33.821,00:34:35.406,There isn't one!
00:34:37.075,00:34:39.577,That isn't how this works!
00:34:39.660,00:34:45.375,"Look, I walk by a building, if a light's on in the window, I got a job."
00:34:52.715,00:34:53.758,Somewhere...
00:34:53.841,00:34:56.677,there's another light in another building.
00:34:56.761,00:35:00.098,I don't do this. I'm somebody else's job.
00:35:00.181,00:35:02.183,You tell her to get herself excused from the jury.
00:35:02.267,00:35:04.894,"Personal reasons, whatever it takes."
00:35:04.977,00:35:07.980,"After that, she never sees you again."
00:35:08.981,00:35:10.275,They'll kill me.
00:35:10.358,00:35:13.403,Then you'd better leave my city... tonight.
00:35:25.915,00:35:33.839,The court grants the motion to excuse juror number eight from service due to extenuating personal circumstances.
00:35:33.923,00:35:37.677,The first alternate juror will replace her.
00:35:39.512,00:35:42.014,Would the defense care to make a closing argument?
00:35:43.516,00:35:46.477,"Yes, Your Honor. Thank you."
00:36:14.422,00:36:16.632,What the hell is he doing?
00:36:31.146,00:36:33.441,"Sorry, Your Honor."
00:36:35.193,00:36:38.321,"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, forgive me if I seem distracted."
00:36:39.655,00:36:44.369,"I've been preoccupied of late with, uh, questions of morality..."
00:36:44.452,00:36:47.330,"of right and wrong, good and evil."
00:36:49.499,00:36:53.586,Sometimes the delineation between the two is a sharp line.
00:36:53.669,00:36:56.171,Sometimes it's a blur...
00:36:56.256,00:36:58.924,and often it's like pornography.
00:37:00.134,00:37:01.511,You just know when you see it.
00:37:04.347,00:37:05.348,A man is dead.
00:37:07.225,00:37:11.562,"I don't mean to make light of that, but these questions..."
00:37:11.646,00:37:14.649,these questions...
00:37:14.732,00:37:16.191,are vital ones...
00:37:16.276,00:37:20.280,because they tether us to each other... to humanity.
00:37:21.281,00:37:22.740,Not everyone feels this way.
00:37:22.823,00:37:26.494,"Not everyone sees the sharp line, only the blur."
00:37:26.577,00:37:28.078,A man is dead. Um...
00:37:29.830,00:37:31.624,A man is dead.
00:37:31.707,00:37:33.918,"And my client, John Healy..."
00:37:34.919,00:37:36.086,took his life.
00:37:37.171,00:37:39.131,This is not in dispute.
00:37:39.214,00:37:44.178,It is a matter of record... of fact... and facts have no moral judgment.
00:37:44.262,00:37:45.430,They merely state what is.
00:37:45.513,00:37:48.182,"Not what we think of them, not what we feel."
00:37:48.266,00:37:50.685,They just are.
00:37:50.768,00:37:57.775,"What was in my client's heart when he took Mr. Prohaszka's life, whether he is a good man or something else entirely, is irrelevant."
00:37:58.693,00:38:05.741,"These questions... of good and evil, as important as they are, have no place in a court of law."
00:38:05.825,00:38:07.785,Only the facts matter.
00:38:07.868,00:38:11.163,My client claims he acted in self-defense.
00:38:11.246,00:38:14.584,Mr. Prohaszka's associates have refused to make a statement regarding the incident.
00:38:14.667,00:38:23.926,"The only other witness, a frightened young woman, has stated that my client was pleasant and friendly, and that she only saw the struggle with Mr. Prohaszka after it had started."
00:38:24.927,00:38:26.846,Those are the facts.
00:38:26.929,00:38:29.098,Based on these...
00:38:29.181,00:38:37.231,"and these alone, the prosecution has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that my client was not acting solely in self-defense."
00:38:37.315,00:38:40.568,"And those, ladies and gentlemen of the jury..."
00:38:40.651,00:38:42.570,are the facts.
00:38:44.614,00:38:51.286,"My client, based purely on the sanctity of the law which we've all sworn an oath to uphold..."
00:38:51.371,00:38:54.039,must be acquitted of these charges.
00:38:54.123,00:38:57.084,"Now, beyond that, beyond these walls..."
00:38:58.378,00:39:02.548,he may well face a judgment of his own making.
00:39:02.632,00:39:04.634,But here...
00:39:04.717,00:39:07.094,in this courtroom...
00:39:07.177,00:39:09.472,the judgment is yours...
00:39:10.640,00:39:12.266,and yours alone.
00:39:25.195,00:39:27.782,I don't care about his...
00:39:27.865,00:39:30.451,Where is he? This needs attention.
00:39:30.535,00:39:32.995,He's indisposed.
00:39:33.078,00:39:34.455,With what?
00:39:36.123,00:39:37.833,Art.
00:39:37.917,00:39:39.293,Art who?
00:39:40.628,00:39:41.879,Paintings.
00:39:42.797,00:39:45.883,-His penthouse is finally ready... -You're shitting me.
00:39:45.966,00:39:48.260,Everything's spinning out of whack and he's decorating?
00:39:48.343,00:39:51.597,"The situation is under control, Leland."
00:39:51.681,00:39:54.308,You've lost your strong-arm and the tape.
00:39:54.392,00:39:58.521,-You got nothing on juror eight now. -She's only a piece of the puzzle.
00:39:58.604,00:40:01.441,You ever try putting a puzzle together with a piece missing?
00:40:01.524,00:40:04.109,It's damned aggravating.
00:40:04.193,00:40:06.654,I don't see why we're going through all of this anyway.
00:40:06.737,00:40:10.199,Just get rid of Healy the way you got rid of the other guy.
00:40:10.282,00:40:14.454,"They find him hanging in his cell, boom-boom, case closed."
00:40:14.537,00:40:17.998,"Rance, Fisher, McClintock, Farnum."
00:40:18.082,00:40:23.463,"We've been leaving a trail of bodies lately, and trails eventually lead somewhere."
00:40:23.546,00:40:28.509,"This... this needed to be handled quietly, within the confines of the law."
00:40:28.593,00:40:31.554,So you hire a couple of back-door shysters?
00:40:32.304,00:40:36.225,I know 100 defense attorneys with more experience than Heckle and Jeckle.
00:40:39.353,00:40:43.315,They just opened shop and they're completely clean.
00:40:43.398,00:40:47.027,Say that about any of the other 100 you know? Huh?
00:40:48.195,00:40:51.949,Two lawyers... above reproach.
00:40:52.032,00:40:54.785,"Self-defense. No questions, no trail."
00:40:54.869,00:40:56.787,There's too much light shining on this.
00:40:56.871,00:41:00.833,I can't move on Prohaszka's holdings until the glare is off.
00:41:00.916,00:41:03.210,Get the papers ready...
00:41:03.293,00:41:05.546,and let my employer worry about the rest.
00:41:15.515,00:41:16.807,Mrs. Fisher?
00:41:18.893,00:41:20.352,Hi.
00:41:20.435,00:41:24.106,"-Um, uh... My name's Karen-- -I know who you are."
00:41:27.317,00:41:29.904,I'm sorry.
00:41:29.987,00:41:33.574,I know how... hard this must be for you.
00:41:35.450,00:41:37.870,My husband was found dead in your apartment.
00:41:40.665,00:41:43.709,Nothing ever happened between me and Daniel.
00:41:43.793,00:41:46.712,You think I don't know that? I know how much Danny loved me.
00:41:46.796,00:41:49.339,"Whatever it is you're after, Miss Page, I can't help you."
00:41:50.966,00:41:52.552,Union Allied?
00:41:55.596,00:41:57.973,They offered me money...
00:41:58.599,00:42:01.519,a lot of money...
00:42:01.602,00:42:06.398,if I sign an agreement to never talk about what happened.
00:42:07.775,00:42:10.110,They offer you something like that?
00:42:13.781,00:42:15.115,They killed Danny.
00:42:15.199,00:42:16.576,They tried to kill me.
00:42:16.659,00:42:21.539,And now they just shuffle some papers and change their name and they get away with it?
00:42:22.707,00:42:25.209,-Let it go. -I've tried.
00:42:27.169,00:42:29.714,It just doesn't feel right.
00:42:31.381,00:42:34.176,He said the same thing.
00:42:34.259,00:42:36.428,A few days before he...
00:42:37.096,00:42:42.602,He said something didn't feel right... at work with the numbers...
00:42:42.685,00:42:47.982,"and I told him that whatever it was, he had a responsibility to do something about it."
00:42:49.650,00:42:52.987,I figure I have a couple years before I explain that part to my kids.
00:42:53.070,00:42:54.905,They have to pay for what they've done.
00:42:54.989,00:42:56.657,-They won't listen. -We'll make them listen.
00:42:56.741,00:42:58.618,I already signed.
00:43:00.160,00:43:03.163,"I have two kids, Miss Page, and they're all that matter to me now."
00:43:04.832,00:43:07.877,If you have anyone that you care about...
00:43:07.960,00:43:10.545,let it go.
00:43:23.475,00:43:27.647,"Shirley, thanks so much for pushing this through."
00:43:28.230,00:43:30.941,I... I owe you one.
00:43:31.025,00:43:32.943,"Okay, thanks. Bye."
00:43:50.085,00:43:51.629,So they tell me.
00:43:52.838,00:43:54.840,I read your article.
00:43:56.300,00:43:58.510,-About the subway line? -Uh...
00:43:58.593,00:44:01.346,About Union Allied Construction.
00:44:02.556,00:44:03.641,"I, um..."
00:44:04.767,00:44:07.937,I think there's more to the story...
00:44:08.020,00:44:10.314,if you're interested.
00:44:16.987,00:44:18.113,Please be seated.
00:44:50.562,00:44:51.772,They're hung.
00:44:51.856,00:44:57.444,"Madam Foreperson, it's my understanding from this note that you have been unable to reach a verdict."
00:44:57.527,00:45:00.072,"We have not, Your Honor."
00:45:00.155,00:45:02.574,Allen charge. She's sending them back in.
00:45:02.657,00:45:04.576,"Still split, DA will retry."
00:45:04.659,00:45:06.703,"No, they won't."
00:45:06.787,00:45:07.955,"Will they, Mr. Healy?"
00:45:08.038,00:45:10.916,"That was a hell of a speech you gave, Murdock."
00:45:12.084,00:45:14.169,A hell of a speech.
00:45:15.629,00:45:22.887,"for time, effort, money, and emotional strain to both the defense and the prosecution."
00:45:22.970,00:45:24.471,If you should fail...
00:47:10.327,00:47:13.622,"The man that hired your lawyers, who does he work for?"
00:47:14.539,00:47:15.832,You think I'm afraid of you?
00:47:25.300,00:47:26.635,Tell me!
00:47:28.387,00:47:29.638,Who does he work for?
00:47:30.180,00:47:32.266,-I can't! -I want a name!
00:47:35.435,00:47:37.562,"Oh, God! Fisk!"
00:47:49.158,00:47:50.742,You get in your car.
00:47:50.825,00:47:53.703,If I ever see you in Hell's Kitchen again-- No.
00:47:55.664,00:47:57.874,You think this is still about you?
00:47:58.875,00:48:01.921,"I gave up his name. You don't do that, not to him."
00:48:04.089,00:48:06.466,He'll find me...
00:48:06.550,00:48:09.136,and make an example...
00:48:10.137,00:48:13.682,and then he'll find everyone I've ever cared about...
00:48:14.891,00:48:17.311,and do the same to them...
00:48:20.647,00:48:23.442,so that no one ever does what I just did.
00:48:30.365,00:48:32.201,You should have just killed me.
00:48:34.703,00:48:36.956,You coward.
00:49:29.799,00:49:32.552,There's an old children's joke.
00:49:32.636,00:49:36.473,"You hold up a white piece of paper and you ask, What's this?"
00:49:39.143,00:49:41.686,A rabbit in a snowstorm.
00:49:45.190,00:49:46.816,You interested or just looking?
00:49:50.029,00:49:55.367,People always ask me how can we charge so much for what amounts to gradations of white.
00:49:55.450,00:50:00.205,I tell them it's not about the artist's name or the skill required...
00:50:01.498,00:50:03.958,not even about the art itself.
00:50:05.919,00:50:07.837,All that matters is...
00:50:09.798,00:50:11.841,How does it make you feel?
00:50:21.226,00:50:23.437,It makes me feel alone.
00:00:39.747,00:00:41.166,Where's Oleg?
00:00:42.375,00:00:44.086,It's just us now.
00:00:45.795,00:00:47.797,We don't need anyone else.
00:00:55.722,00:00:58.015,Only each other.
00:01:05.022,00:01:07.817,"Soon it'll just be you, Vladimir."
00:01:09.236,00:01:11.863,"No, my brother."
00:01:11.946,00:01:15.075,We leave here together.
00:01:16.493,00:01:17.577,Tonight.
00:01:20.122,00:01:22.082,Where did you get this?
00:01:24.251,00:01:25.252,A gift...
00:01:26.169,00:01:27.170,from Alexei.
00:01:31.466,00:01:33.885,The guards shouldn't have left him for the rats.
00:01:37.639,00:01:40.392,Will we see Moscow?
00:01:40.475,00:01:41.768,Moscow?
00:01:43.811,00:01:46.523,It's a city buried in the past.
00:01:47.690,00:01:49.651,We must look to...
00:01:49.734,00:01:51.153,the future.
00:01:51.236,00:01:52.612,America.
00:01:52.695,00:01:54.156,Where we will rule...
00:01:54.239,00:01:55.948,as kings.
00:02:07.710,00:02:09.504,He's here!
00:02:09.587,00:02:11.464,Who do you think?
00:02:11.548,00:02:13.633,"No, I don't know how he found us."
00:02:14.842,00:02:16.428,Where's my brother?
00:02:16.511,00:02:18.346,"Listen, shut up!"
00:02:18.430,00:02:20.265,Shut up! I don't care what he told you...
00:02:20.348,00:02:22.016,get him on the phone!
00:09:51.423,00:09:53.384,Prissy little bitch.
00:09:54.927,00:09:56.053,Reach out to Piotr.
00:09:56.137,00:09:57.138,Why?
00:09:57.221,00:09:58.848,Why do you think?
00:09:59.766,00:10:03.936,If Wesley's employer finds out-- His employer?
00:10:04.020,00:10:06.063,Do you know why Fisk...
00:10:06.147,00:10:08.565,doesn't want anyone saying his name?
00:10:10.735,00:10:13.821,Because it would betray that he's just a man.
00:10:13.905,00:10:16.115,So's the guy in the mask...
00:10:17.533,00:10:20.161,and look what he's done to us.
00:10:22.329,00:10:23.455,Yeah.
00:10:25.541,00:10:27.543,What do we know about him?
00:10:27.627,00:10:28.670,Nothing.
00:10:29.336,00:10:32.589,Semyon might have found something...
00:10:32.674,00:10:34.676,but he sleeps like the dead.
00:10:35.677,00:10:37.511,Jesus rose on the third day...
00:10:39.471,00:10:41.641,Semyon has slept long enough.
00:14:05.594,00:14:06.595,My God.
00:14:08.014,00:14:09.431,Give me the kit.
00:14:15.312,00:14:16.855,This could kill him.
00:14:18.524,00:14:21.610,Semyon's usually the one we send for this sort of work.
00:14:22.778,00:14:24.780,He'd understand.
00:14:31.245,00:14:32.955,You hear back from Piotr?
00:14:33.039,00:14:35.499,Said he'd call when he had something on Fisk's movements.
00:14:37.376,00:14:38.878,Fisk is cautious.
00:14:38.961,00:14:41.338,If he suspects-- Then what?
00:14:42.256,00:14:44.425,What are you so afraid of?
00:14:45.676,00:14:49.221,We were in that hellhole for three years.
00:14:50.139,00:14:52.058,From princes of Moscow...
00:14:52.141,00:14:53.559,to shitting in a bucket.
00:14:54.726,00:14:57.771,I promised myself if we ever got free...
00:14:57.854,00:15:00.066,we'd never lose what we had again.
00:15:00.149,00:15:01.483,Especially not to pride.
00:15:03.527,00:15:07.739,"Back when we had nothing, we agreed on everything."
00:15:09.450,00:15:11.452,We've lost our way...
00:15:11.535,00:15:13.329,in this land of riches.
00:15:16.207,00:15:17.708,Then let's find it again...
00:15:17.791,00:15:19.501,together.
00:15:38.895,00:15:40.231,You sure...
00:15:40.314,00:15:42.358,this was epinephrine?
00:15:46.988,00:15:48.822,Get his tube out.
00:15:57.331,00:15:59.000,Semyon...
00:15:59.083,00:16:00.292,It's us...
00:16:00.376,00:16:01.793,Anatoly and Vladimir.
00:16:02.711,00:16:03.963,That's it...
00:16:04.838,00:16:06.215,Breathe...
00:16:06.298,00:16:07.883,Breathe...
00:16:09.801,00:16:12.054,And tell us about the man who did this to you.
00:16:12.972,00:16:14.348,The devil.
00:16:15.307,00:16:16.642,The devil.
00:16:19.020,00:16:20.354,Did you see anything?
00:16:21.563,00:16:24.066,Anything that could help us find him?
00:16:25.734,00:16:27.194,There was a woman...
00:16:38.122,00:16:39.706,Get Sergei on the phone.
00:24:40.270,00:24:42.188,"Yeah, we have the woman."
00:24:42.272,00:24:44.065,We're taking her there now.
00:27:45.205,00:27:46.622,Do you remember me?
00:27:47.582,00:27:49.125,Yes.
00:27:49.918,00:27:52.462,Claire's been taken by some very bad people.
00:27:52.545,00:27:54.339,I heard them say your name.
00:27:57.300,00:27:59.302,I need your help. Please.
00:28:00.220,00:28:04.307,I didn't say anything. Not at first.
00:28:04.390,00:28:07.769,Then they took me up to the roof like you did with that man...
00:28:07.853,00:28:10.563,They told me if I said anything to anyone...
00:28:10.646,00:28:12.941,They'd come back for my mother.
00:28:13.024,00:28:15.110,Do you know where they took Claire?
00:28:15.193,00:28:16.694,No.
00:28:16.778,00:28:18.196,I'm sorry...
00:28:18.780,00:28:20.949,Those men are going to hurt her because of me.
00:28:21.032,00:28:23.409,"No, it's not your fault, Santino."
00:28:23.493,00:28:25.370,It's mine.
00:28:27.247,00:28:29.750,Is there anything else you heard or saw?
00:28:30.666,00:28:32.585,Anything that might help me find her?
00:28:33.503,00:28:35.630,I saw them get into a taxi.
00:28:36.547,00:28:39.175,"But not in the back, in the front."
00:28:39.259,00:28:41.552,Like it was theirs.
00:28:41.636,00:28:43.513,What was the company?
00:28:44.514,00:28:45.891,Did you see a name?
00:31:55.746,00:31:57.290,Sergei...
00:31:57.373,00:32:00.919,Vladimir told us not to kill her until she talks.
00:32:23.942,00:32:25.276,"Mikhail, check the breaker."
00:32:26.027,00:32:27.653,Check the breaker!
00:32:37.205,00:32:38.331,Mikhail?
00:32:40.000,00:32:41.001,Mikhail!
00:38:42.152,00:38:43.404,Sergei...
00:38:44.154,00:38:45.615,Who did this?
00:38:46.949,00:38:48.576,The man in black...
00:38:54.540,00:38:56.083,All right. Stay there.
00:38:57.209,00:38:58.503,That was Piotr.
00:38:58.586,00:38:59.837,Fisk has come out of hiding.
00:39:01.547,00:39:03.383,"We need his help, brother."
00:39:04.299,00:39:06.594,I will not bow before that man!
00:39:10.264,00:39:12.517,Then I will go...
00:39:12.600,00:39:15.019,And bow for both of us.
00:39:23.027,00:39:24.612,Go.
00:39:24.695,00:39:26.947,Make the deal.
00:00:55.722,00:00:57.932,Only each other.
00:01:43.811,00:01:45.938,It's a city buried in the past.
00:03:48.311,00:03:49.896,Yeah. Ow.
00:03:49.979,00:03:51.147,Sorry.
00:03:52.232,00:03:55.485,"So, how's that working out for you?"
00:03:57.237,00:03:59.030,You should see the other guys.
00:03:59.113,00:04:00.448,I have.
00:04:01.241,00:04:04.411,"The one you threw off the roof, at my place?"
00:04:04.494,00:04:07.372,He's in a coma. Do you know that?
00:04:07.455,00:04:09.206,"Yeah, I heard."
00:04:11.083,00:04:12.544,How do you feel about that?
00:04:14.254,00:04:15.547,I'll live.
00:04:25.390,00:04:33.940,"I was supposed to be coming in, feeding this guy twice a day while my friend was out of town, not hiding out here using up all my sick days."
00:04:34.023,00:04:35.066,Just a while longer.
00:04:35.149,00:04:37.569,Just till I know the Russians aren't looking for you.
00:04:38.486,00:04:41.531,I'm not the one that looks like they've been through the grinder.
00:04:41.614,00:04:44.033,You really need to get some kind of body armor or something.
00:04:44.617,00:04:45.827,It would slow me down too much.
00:04:45.910,00:04:48.037,So will a bullet.
00:04:48.120,00:04:49.914,You worried about me?
00:04:51.416,00:04:52.959,What if I were?
00:04:53.835,00:04:57.505,"I would tell you I'm a big boy, and not to be."
00:04:59.507,00:05:00.675,Right.
00:05:01.718,00:05:03.428,That's why you keep ending up here.
00:05:04.095,00:05:05.930,"Well, maybe I just like the sound of your voice."
00:05:06.013,00:05:07.098,Hmm.
00:05:08.808,00:05:12.312,So what happens the night you come by...
00:05:12.395,00:05:14.314,I'm already talking to someone else?
00:05:23.865,00:05:26.743,"Um, you shouldn't have."
00:05:29.662,00:05:32.081,I didn't. The burner's for me.
00:05:32.164,00:05:34.125,"Memorize the number, put yours in."
00:05:34.208,00:05:36.378,"Next time I need to come by, I'll call."
00:05:39.381,00:05:43.551,"By come by, do you mean stumble in, bleeding half to death?"
00:05:43.635,00:05:45.678,"Yeah, something like that."
00:05:47.514,00:05:50.392,You're gonna get yourself killed. You really gotta ease up.
00:05:53.895,00:05:55.522,"I can take care of myself, Mike."
00:05:55.605,00:05:57.314,-You know-- -It's not just about you.
00:06:01.486,00:06:03.696,It's a little more complicated than that.
00:06:03.780,00:06:06.658,You ever heard the name Wilson Fisk?
00:06:06.741,00:06:09.911,No... who's that?
00:06:11.704,00:06:13.289,Just a name somebody gave me.
00:06:14.707,00:06:16.793,But there's no public record.
00:06:16.876,00:06:20.379,Nothing on the Internet. Not one mention of Fisk.
00:06:20.463,00:06:22.757,Maybe whoever gave you his name was lying.
00:06:22.840,00:06:25.092,I would have known if he was.
00:06:25.176,00:06:26.343,How?
00:06:27.344,00:06:29.388,Heartbeat.
00:06:29.472,00:06:32.850,"Right, of course, heartbeat."
00:06:33.518,00:06:41.484,"So, what, you're just gonna go out there punching whoever you can, hoping to find somebody who knows this Fisk guy?"
00:06:41.568,00:06:44.987,"Well, apply enough pressure, someone will break."
00:07:09.220,00:07:13.224,-Oof. Those look like they hurt. -I've had worse.
00:07:13.307,00:07:19.689,"I know how much your people delight in extolling the amount of pain they can endure, but maybe next time you could try ducking?"
00:07:21.107,00:07:23.651,Leland's finalized the paperwork.
00:07:23.735,00:07:30.324,Prohaszka's holdings in Kitchen Cab have been acquired and transferred via third party to Veles Taxi.
00:07:31.784,00:07:34.203,Your distribution infrastructure just doubled.
00:07:34.286,00:07:37.164,Tell your employer we are grateful.
00:07:39.459,00:07:41.919,Don't think he really cares at the moment.
00:07:42.920,00:07:44.672,You were light again this week.
00:07:44.756,00:07:46.508,There was a complication.
00:07:46.591,00:07:48.300,One you assured us you were addressing.
00:07:48.384,00:07:50.970,Do you know what he was asking?
00:07:51.053,00:07:53.097,This fool who laid hands on my brother?
00:07:55.224,00:07:58.770,"He was asking about your employer, by name."
00:08:00.647,00:08:03.232,All the more reason to settle this.
00:08:03.315,00:08:06.027,"You sneeze, we all catch a cold."
00:08:06.819,00:08:10.948,Madame Gao and Mr. Nobu have expressed their disappointment.
00:08:11.032,00:08:12.449,We have not heard of this.
00:08:12.534,00:08:21.375,"Hmm, that's because we've been talking behind your back, about how the Russians can't seem to handle one man running around in a mask."
00:08:22.001,00:08:29.466,"I mean, if he had an iron suit or a magic hammer, maybe that would explain why you keep getting your asses handed to you-- We're done here."
00:08:31.218,00:08:32.762,He's weakened your operation.
00:08:36.307,00:08:38.434,"This isn't personal, Vladimir."
00:08:38.518,00:08:39.686,It's business.
00:08:39.769,00:08:46.358,"Distribution of Madame Gao's product has been affected, which in turn is causing delays in other ventures."
00:08:46.442,00:08:48.444,This is not acceptable.
00:08:48.528,00:08:54.283,"Fortunately for all parties, my employer has agreed to help return you to solid footing."
00:08:54.366,00:08:55.660,How?
00:08:55.743,00:09:02.208,By aiding you in certain duties deemed vital to the continuation of service-- He wants to take over.
00:09:02.291,00:09:08.130,"We value the services you provide, but clearly you need help providing them."
00:09:08.214,00:09:10.257,We'll all profit nicely under the new structure.
00:09:12.594,00:09:15.805,-Tell Mr. Fisk-- -We don't say his name.
00:09:17.389,00:09:20.142,Tell... Mr. Fisk...
00:09:21.185,00:09:23.688,that if he wants a pound of flesh...
00:09:24.313,00:09:26.816,he can come here and carve it himself.
00:09:32.238,00:09:35.700,"This is an offer, not an order."
00:09:35.783,00:09:39.203,The choice of how we proceed is yours.
00:09:40.204,00:09:42.289,Talk it over with your brother.
00:09:43.207,00:09:44.876,We'll be in touch.
00:10:09.483,00:10:10.652,Hmm?
00:10:56.155,00:10:57.364,And...
00:10:58.282,00:11:00.159,it's a story I've heard before.
00:11:00.242,00:11:04.747,"Company gets caught up in a scandal, files for bankruptcy, then quietly restructures under a new name."
00:11:04.831,00:11:08.710,They killed Daniel Fisher. They tried to kill me.
00:11:08.793,00:11:11.003,I'm still a little unclear on that point.
00:11:12.088,00:11:15.257,You say here Rance assaulted you in your apartment.
00:11:15.341,00:11:18.677,And a man in a black mask saved your life?
00:11:19.804,00:11:22.598,"Yes, but he just-- He came out of nowhere."
00:11:22.681,00:11:25.101,-And you'd never seen him before? -No.
00:11:30.898,00:11:34.401,Do you really believe that he just up and hung himself in jail?
00:11:34.485,00:11:37.154,That guard tried to do the same thing to me.
00:11:37.238,00:11:38.280,Why don't you ask him?
00:11:38.364,00:11:39.866,Farnum?
00:11:39.949,00:11:41.075,He's dead.
00:11:41.158,00:11:44.036,Ate the barrel of his gun in his basement.
00:11:44.120,00:11:45.454,"And your old boss, McClintock?"
00:11:46.163,00:11:48.499,Overdosed on pills or some such.
00:11:50.001,00:11:52.503,"You seeing a pattern here, Miss Page?"
00:11:53.504,00:11:56.215,Then why isn't anyone looking into this?
00:11:58.885,00:12:01.220,You don't understand how lucky you are.
00:12:02.304,00:12:06.100,"Count the angels on the head of a pin, and move on."
00:12:07.643,00:12:11.147,So they just shuffle some papers and all this disappears?
00:12:14.441,00:12:19.113,"A construction company is brick and mortar, literally."
00:12:19.196,00:12:26.620,"All right, you cannot just shift cranes and trailers and office equipment like you can numbers on a page."
00:12:26.703,00:12:30.332,There has to be a trail if everything is being liquidated.
00:12:36.297,00:12:37.589,Thanks for the coffee.
00:12:41.928,00:12:43.387,So that's it?
00:12:44.305,00:12:48.184,"Stories like this are built on sources, Miss Page."
00:12:48.267,00:12:50.144,Credible sources.
00:12:52.188,00:12:54.523,"I did some digging into your, uh..."
00:12:56.275,00:12:58.277,past activities.
00:13:01.322,00:13:03.532,"Well, I did some digging, too."
00:13:04.700,00:13:07.119,I read every big story with your byline.
00:13:12.708,00:13:18.380,"Hell, you pretty much brought down the Italian mob back when I was in diapers."
00:13:19.631,00:13:23.094,"What ever happened to that reporter, Mr. Urich?"
00:13:29.683,00:13:31.060,He got old.
00:13:32.728,00:13:34.730,And a hell of a lot less stupid.
00:15:17.791,00:15:19.418,together.
00:16:20.437,00:16:21.480,Semyon?
00:17:05.441,00:17:06.650,Hola.
00:17:08.069,00:17:09.278,Hola.
00:17:18.204,00:17:25.502,"He seems more amenable to the proposition, or at least not quite as... vitriolic as his brother."
00:17:25.586,00:17:28.214,"Well, confrontations can be expensive."
00:17:29.423,00:17:31.842,I'd prefer to handle this quietly.
00:17:36.430,00:17:38.849,Within a reasonable margin.
00:17:38.932,00:17:41.352,Assuming we can settle with the Russians quickly.
00:17:41.435,00:17:43.770,We will. One way or another.
00:17:44.438,00:17:46.940,What about the masked idiot?
00:17:51.445,00:17:55.741,"If the brothers can't handle him, I'll find another solution."
00:18:05.959,00:18:07.002,No.
00:18:10.172,00:18:11.882,You stay with the car.
00:18:11.965,00:18:13.800,Sir...
00:18:13.884,00:18:16.470,I need to attend to this alone.
00:18:20.474,00:18:21.933,"Thank you, Wesley."
00:19:03.892,00:19:05.602,"Well, hello there."
00:19:07.771,00:19:10.774,How are you enjoying rabbit in a snowstorm?
00:19:11.817,00:19:13.068,You remember.
00:19:13.152,00:19:16.655,Of course... It's one of my favorite pieces.
00:19:16.738,00:19:18.949,I hung it in my bedroom.
00:19:20.367,00:19:22.994,It's the last thing I see every night.
00:19:24.621,00:19:28.875,That's either very romantic or very sad.
00:19:31.628,00:19:33.672,Don't we all?
00:19:33.755,00:19:35.131,I wanted...
00:19:36.967,00:19:40.387,I wanted to thank you for it... personally.
00:19:41.763,00:19:45.392,"That's really not necessary, but you're welcome."
00:19:45.476,00:19:46.935,Is there anything else I can help you with?
00:19:47.018,00:19:48.437,"No, I..."
00:19:51.273,00:19:55.694,"Yes, I was actually wondering if you cared to join me for dinner."
00:19:56.278,00:19:57.988,I'm the only one working here tonight.
00:19:58.989,00:20:00.407,That's okay.
00:20:01.742,00:20:04.203,-Another time then. -Mmm-hmm.
00:20:09.208,00:20:13.420,You're not gonna offer to buy every painting in here so I can close up early?
00:20:13.504,00:20:15.714,A guy actually tried that once.
00:20:23.555,00:20:26.225,A woman that can be bought...
00:20:26.808,00:20:29.019,isn't worth having.
00:20:37.193,00:20:39.405,I'm partial to Italian.
00:20:47.413,00:20:48.539,Vanessa.
00:21:13.522,00:21:15.607,"Eat it, you little bastard."
00:22:05.782,00:22:09.035,"I said, No, Mom, I want to be a lawyer. I don't remember what I said next."
00:22:09.119,00:22:10.621,"No, you never do."
00:22:10.704,00:22:14.708,But I'm fairly certain it wasn't about bailing out a piss-drunk electrician who nearly burned his house down.
00:22:14.791,00:22:16.126,Let's cross.
00:22:16.209,00:22:19.087,"Ed's wife left him, Foggy. It was an accident."
00:22:19.170,00:22:22.674,"Admittedly involving cigarettes and gasoline, but still."
00:22:22.758,00:22:24.843,I could be carving my own corned beef.
00:22:24.926,00:22:28.179,"Making my own pickles, have a little shop of my own."
00:22:28.263,00:22:30.932,-You got your own office. -We have office space.
00:22:31.016,00:22:38.732,"An actual office would involve plantery and equipment, fax machines or whatever successful people use."
00:22:41.860,00:22:45.071,How would I know? Which is endemic to the problem.
00:22:46.072,00:22:48.867,"Matt, what if we're doing this all wrong?"
00:22:48.950,00:22:50.661,What if Landman and Zack was the way to go?
00:22:50.744,00:22:52.704,You hated interning there.
00:22:52.788,00:22:54.372,I hate being broke.
00:22:55.373,00:22:57.125,You think Landman and Zack would have helped out Ed?
00:22:57.208,00:22:58.710,No.
00:22:58.794,00:23:01.755,But they had free bagels... every morning.
00:23:01.838,00:23:04.716,And they had furniture that didn't smell like a pack of cigarettes.
00:23:04.800,00:23:07.093,"And elevators... God, I miss the elevators."
00:23:07.177,00:23:09.304,"-We're doing good here, Foggy. -Are we?"
00:23:09.387,00:23:10.722,"Yeah, we're making a difference."
00:23:14.768,00:23:16.269,You get a new phone? We afford that?
00:23:17.145,00:23:19.272,"Hey, one sec. Foggy, I'll see you tomorrow."
00:23:19.355,00:23:22.192,"It's a girl, isn't it? You got a new phone just for your girls."
00:23:22.275,00:23:24.486,-My life sucks. -Get home safe.
00:23:26.279,00:23:27.322,"Hey, what's up?"
00:23:29.991,00:23:30.992,"Claire, can you hear me?"
00:23:51.054,00:23:52.263,Claire.
00:25:07.463,00:25:10.300,"...5 and now 50. 50 right there, and now 55."
00:25:10.383,00:25:12.093,"55,000 here. Now 60."
00:25:12.177,00:25:16.056,"60,000. Who will bid 60,000? Do I have 60,000?"
00:25:16.139,00:25:19.100,"55, going once, going twice."
00:25:19.184,00:25:21.603,"Sold for 55,000."
00:25:21.687,00:25:23.814,"Next up, lot 87."
00:25:24.731,00:25:28.694,Liquidation of Union Allied Construction LLC.
00:25:28.777,00:25:38.745,"Forty-two desktops with Thunderbolt display, 14 copy machines, 62 IP phones, as well as supporting equipment listed in your catalog."
00:25:38.829,00:25:42.165,"Estimated value, 540,000."
00:25:44.417,00:25:46.211,"Do I hear 70,000?"
00:25:48.129,00:25:51.592,"70,000 right here, and now 75. 75,000?"
00:25:51.675,00:25:53.551,"I have 75 over here, and now 80."
00:25:53.635,00:25:55.762,"Do I have 80,000? 80,000."
00:25:55.846,00:25:57.931,"80,000 in the back, thank you. And now 90..."
00:25:58.473,00:26:01.184,Stop what you're doing. Don't turn around.
00:26:04.437,00:26:06.064,This is how you get caught.
00:26:08.692,00:26:10.652,The hell do you care?
00:26:10.736,00:26:13.404,"To your right, a woman in a white blouse."
00:26:16.157,00:26:18.785,"To your left, a man in a navy blue pinstripe suit."
00:26:22.580,00:26:23.581,Who are they?
00:26:23.665,00:26:26.960,Don't know. But they aren't bidding either.
00:26:31.632,00:26:32.716,What do I do?
00:26:32.799,00:26:36.511,Spend the next hour raising your paddle. Win something.
00:26:37.428,00:26:39.389,One of the smaller lots.
00:26:42.809,00:26:44.519,Meet me at the diner when you're done.
00:26:45.436,00:26:47.563,How did you know I was here?
00:26:50.108,00:26:51.317,Ben?
00:26:55.196,00:26:58.033,"225 going once, going twice."
00:26:58.116,00:27:00.869,"Sold for $225,000."
00:27:24.142,00:27:25.310,Let's go.
00:27:40.826,00:27:42.953,"It's okay. It's me, Santino."
00:28:48.393,00:28:50.979,Veles. Veles Taxi.
00:29:08.079,00:29:09.164,Yes.
00:29:16.129,00:29:17.839,I hope you like it.
00:29:26.347,00:29:28.349,It's delicious.
00:29:29.475,00:29:31.436,I don't know much about wine.
00:29:32.228,00:29:34.564,"My assistant, he recommended it."
00:29:34.647,00:29:36.566,Maybe I should be out with him.
00:29:38.819,00:29:40.653,"-That was a joke. -Yes, of course."
00:29:44.699,00:29:46.742,"You don't do this much, do you?"
00:29:46.827,00:29:47.869,No.
00:29:49.454,00:29:52.582,I've been preoccupied... for a long time.
00:29:56.502,00:29:58.964,This is nice. I didn't even know it was here.
00:29:59.047,00:30:00.882,"Yes, it just opened last month."
00:30:01.800,00:30:03.634,The city's really changing.
00:30:04.552,00:30:05.887,Not fast enough.
00:30:05.971,00:30:07.848,I don't know.
00:30:07.931,00:30:10.683,Be a shame to see all the character scrubbed away.
00:30:10.766,00:30:12.768,"You didn't grow up here, did you?"
00:30:14.145,00:30:16.189,What gave it away?
00:30:19.109,00:30:22.904,"When I was a kid, I used to dream what it would be like to..."
00:30:26.032,00:30:28.701,to live somewhere far away from Hell's Kitchen.
00:30:28.784,00:30:30.620,Somewhere beautiful.
00:30:32.956,00:30:34.540,What made you stay?
00:30:36.209,00:30:40.421,"When I was 12 years old, my mother, she sent me to stay with relatives."
00:30:40.505,00:30:43.591,"Had a farm, middle of nowhere."
00:30:45.260,00:30:47.262,Those were good years.
00:30:48.513,00:30:50.015,But you came back.
00:30:50.098,00:30:51.182,Yes.
00:30:53.351,00:30:59.065,"Time and distance, they afford a certain clarity."
00:30:59.149,00:31:04.654,"I realized that this city was a part of me, that it was in my blood."
00:31:06.031,00:31:08.950,And I would do anything to make it a better place...
00:31:09.784,00:31:11.577,for people like you.
00:31:18.126,00:31:20.170,To a better place.
00:31:35.685,00:31:38.188,"You answer, he stops hitting you."
00:31:40.648,00:31:42.858,"I told you, I don't know who he is."
00:31:47.238,00:31:48.489,Tell me his name.
00:31:52.702,00:31:54.955,He never told me. He never told me!
00:32:04.422,00:32:05.631,It really doesn't.
00:32:05.715,00:32:07.758,But I have been given a job to do.
00:32:07.842,00:32:11.637,"So please, answer the questions that I was told to ask."
00:32:16.392,00:32:19.645,"Or I will begin breaking you, a piece at a time."
00:32:26.027,00:32:27.237,Check the breaker!
00:32:45.005,00:32:47.048,You want to know his name?
00:34:34.239,00:34:36.657,"I'm not playing with you, man."
00:34:36.741,00:34:39.994,I'm walking out of here-- I'll blow her brains out!
00:34:42.247,00:34:45.208,or I promise you you'll never hold anything in that hand again.
00:34:53.091,00:34:56.427,"It hurts, doesn't it? Being in pain, being afraid."
00:35:13.736,00:35:15.029,It's okay.
00:35:18.783,00:35:19.950,I'm here.
00:35:21.952,00:35:23.246,I have you.
00:35:49.230,00:35:51.774,-You bid on anything? -Yeah.
00:35:51.857,00:35:54.902,"Some, uh... office equipment from a realtor."
00:35:54.985,00:35:56.487,Nearly as old as I am.
00:35:58.281,00:35:59.574,Win?
00:35:59.657,00:36:02.034,"Yeah, 3,500 I don't have."
00:36:02.117,00:36:05.288,I charged it to the law firm where I work.
00:36:05.371,00:36:07.415,Probably just got my ass fired.
00:36:08.458,00:36:10.293,Beats the alternative.
00:36:14.839,00:36:16.048,"-Oh, sure thing. -Thanks."
00:36:20.636,00:36:23.264,How did you know I was gonna be there?
00:36:25.266,00:36:27.227,Wasn't looking for you.
00:36:30.355,00:36:32.440,I thought you weren't interested.
00:36:32.523,00:36:35.109,I said you should move on.
00:36:35.193,00:36:37.403,Didn't say anything about me.
00:36:38.696,00:36:40.240,So I was right.
00:36:41.532,00:36:42.992,About the office equipment.
00:36:43.075,00:36:47.872,"Union Allied or whatever it is that they're calling themselves now, they're buying it back."
00:36:48.456,00:36:51.876,"I mean, you follow that, maybe you find the guy behind the curtain."
00:36:51.959,00:36:54.337,You said you read a bunch of my articles.
00:36:55.546,00:36:58.466,"Remember the one about the, uh... the runoff?"
00:36:59.509,00:37:01.969,What that company was dumping into the river?
00:37:02.052,00:37:03.471,"Yeah, sure."
00:37:03.554,00:37:07.892,Fished the guy that tipped me off out of that same river a month later.
00:37:09.769,00:37:13.273,And that fella trying to clean up the Teachers Union?
00:37:13.356,00:37:15.650,Moved out of state...
00:37:15.733,00:37:18.444,after flyers went up saying he was a pedophile.
00:37:20.738,00:37:24.284,They underestimated what people in power will do to stay there.
00:37:24.367,00:37:28.329,Didn't think you'd make the same mistake after what happened to you.
00:37:32.207,00:37:34.126,What about the woman?
00:37:35.295,00:37:38.714,From your first series of articles about the VA?
00:37:38.798,00:37:40.591,What happened to her?
00:37:42.051,00:37:43.969,She met the worst fate.
00:37:45.513,00:37:47.139,Married beneath her...
00:37:48.223,00:37:50.726,to a workaholic who never appreciated her.
00:37:55.440,00:37:57.525,We need to be smart.
00:37:57.608,00:37:59.985,Smarter than they are.
00:38:00.069,00:38:04.532,"Don't visit me at the office anymore, and don't tell anyone else about this."
00:38:04.615,00:38:09.119,"If that doesn't work for you, get up and get the hell out of my life."
00:38:16.251,00:38:20.465,"First thing, sign the agreement from the Union Allied lawyer."
00:38:20.548,00:38:21.799,What? No!
00:38:21.882,00:38:25.886,"No, I sign that, I can't ever talk publicly about this."
00:38:25.970,00:38:27.096,Yeah...
00:38:28.306,00:38:29.682,but I'm not signing it.
00:39:34.455,00:39:35.998,Are you sure about dessert?
00:39:38.501,00:39:41.295,Don't children have that at birthday parties?
00:39:43.381,00:39:45.716,"When I was a kid, I loved it."
00:39:46.884,00:39:49.219,Probably loved it a bit too much.
00:39:51.096,00:39:54.016,"Well, now I have to know what it tastes like."
00:39:54.099,00:39:55.768,You wanna split one?
00:39:55.851,00:39:57.102,Yes.
00:40:08.030,00:40:11.701,"Milk chocolate, not the dark stuff they say is better for you."
00:40:11.784,00:40:13.243,I can order something else.
00:40:13.327,00:40:16.997,"No, no, it's good to try new things. Get out of the comfort zone."
00:40:17.081,00:40:19.959,"Yes, we get caught up in what we're doing..."
00:40:22.127,00:40:23.963,who we think we are.
00:40:24.046,00:40:25.172,So...
00:40:27.049,00:40:28.926,"who are you, Wilson?"
00:40:30.803,00:40:32.722,"Tonight, I'm just a man..."
00:40:33.848,00:40:36.684,enjoying the company of a captivating woman.
00:40:44.984,00:40:47.277,"Sir, I need to speak with you."
00:40:47.361,00:40:48.779,What is this?
00:40:50.155,00:40:52.575,We need to go... now. I'm sorry.
00:40:52.658,00:41:00.708,"I want to tell you, my brother and I, we gratefully accept-- Understood."
00:41:10.676,00:41:12.762,"Oh, it's not that old... I think."
00:41:12.845,00:41:15.222,"Um, but the rest of the stuff's coming tomorrow."
00:41:15.305,00:41:16.348,The rest?
00:41:16.431,00:41:19.393,"Yeah, like, a printer and conference phones and a copier and..."
00:41:19.477,00:41:23.147,"Yeah, there was an auction and, you know, we needed stuff, so I, um..."
00:41:23.230,00:41:24.649,charged it to the office.
00:41:24.732,00:41:26.191,"But don't freak out, okay?"
00:41:26.275,00:41:28.861,"I got a thing, some money coming in from..."
00:41:29.820,00:41:31.781,You know what? It doesn't matter.
00:41:31.864,00:41:33.115,You mad?
00:41:35.284,00:41:37.912,I ever tell you my mom wanted me to be a butcher?
00:41:38.996,00:41:40.080,A butcher?
00:41:40.164,00:41:42.291,Yeah. You know what I told her?
00:41:47.547,00:41:49.882,This isn't gonna feel great.
00:41:51.967,00:41:53.052,Ow.
00:41:59.767,00:42:02.394,You got pretty good hands for a blind guy.
00:42:03.896,00:42:05.648,Used to patch up my dad.
00:42:06.857,00:42:09.068,"He ran around in a mask, too?"
00:42:10.570,00:42:12.112,He was a boxer.
00:42:14.114,00:42:16.033,-Took a lot of beatings. -Huh.
00:42:16.742,00:42:18.703,So you take after him then.
00:42:20.955,00:42:21.956,Ow.
00:42:22.748,00:42:23.874,Shit.
00:42:24.667,00:42:26.126,I'm sorry.
00:42:28.713,00:42:31.006,It's okay. You've had a lot worse.
00:42:38.806,00:42:42.101,I never thought that I'd be putting anyone else at risk.
00:42:44.311,00:42:45.813,It was my choice.
00:42:45.896,00:42:49.483,You didn't ask me to pull you from that dumpster.
00:42:49.567,00:42:52.444,"No, you did it because you're a good person."
00:42:53.696,00:42:55.740,And you almost got killed...
00:42:57.532,00:42:58.868,because of me.
00:42:58.951,00:43:00.995,Tell me it was worth it.
00:43:02.997,00:43:06.584,Tell me that you've got a plan... an end game.
00:43:06.667,00:43:09.128,-Claire... -Anything?
00:43:11.922,00:43:14.717,"I'm just trying to make my city a better place, that's all."
00:43:17.177,00:43:20.598,Ow. I think maybe it's a little more complicated than that now.
00:43:21.932,00:43:24.143,Nothing's changing out there.
00:43:25.978,00:43:28.814,"No matter what I do, I'm just-- I'm making things worse."
00:43:28.898,00:43:32.442,Tell that to the boy you saved from the Russians.
00:43:32.526,00:43:34.153,Or all the other people you've helped.
00:43:34.236,00:43:37.698,And what about the people I've gotten hurt? What do I...
00:43:37.782,00:43:38.949,What do I tell them?
00:43:44.622,00:43:46.248,Feel my heart.
00:43:48.626,00:43:50.252,"Come on, feel it."
00:43:54.131,00:43:56.258,What is it telling you?
00:44:01.681,00:44:02.848,That you're scared.
00:44:05.059,00:44:06.518,Because I am.
00:44:08.646,00:44:10.981,More than I've ever been in my life.
00:44:12.066,00:44:13.734,And I am not alone.
00:44:15.569,00:44:18.572,But you can do something about it...
00:44:18.656,00:44:20.950,"for all of us, Mike."
00:44:24.578,00:44:25.705,Matthew.
00:44:30.835,00:44:32.294,My name is Matthew.
00:44:46.558,00:44:49.394,I don't usually date customers.
00:44:49.478,00:44:51.731,You came out with me tonight.
00:44:52.647,00:44:55.109,"And here we are, so..."
00:44:56.068,00:44:57.820,I can...
00:44:57.903,00:45:05.702,"return the painting, and then I'd no longer be a-- I'm not interested in gestures, Wilson, or your money, or..."
00:45:07.662,00:45:10.290,whatever that was all about at the restaurant.
00:45:11.375,00:45:13.794,I went out with you because...
00:45:16.756,00:45:19.383,there's something different about you.
00:45:20.634,00:45:22.386,Not so sure it's a good thing now.
00:45:23.303,00:45:24.889,Like you said...
00:45:26.598,00:45:28.392,I don't do this much.
00:45:29.393,00:45:33.480,"And I'm sorry that our night, it went sideways."
00:45:34.815,00:45:35.983,But...
00:45:37.860,00:45:41.113,"I enjoyed our time together very much, Vanessa."
00:45:44.033,00:45:46.118,If you don't feel the same...
00:45:47.161,00:45:48.829,even a little bit...
00:45:49.746,00:45:54.043,"just tell me, and I promise you won't see me again."
00:46:03.135,00:46:04.219,I...
00:46:06.221,00:46:08.140,don't know how I feel.
00:46:29.369,00:46:33.498,"And even after all that, you didn't even get a name out of the girl?"
00:46:33.582,00:46:34.624,No.
00:46:35.625,00:46:38.378,The man in black came before our men had finished.
00:46:40.589,00:46:43.884,"You were right to reach out to us, although..."
00:46:43.968,00:46:45.928,a call would have been more appropriate.
00:46:47.096,00:46:48.973,"Look, I..."
00:46:49.056,00:46:51.976,I wanted to speak with him in person.
00:46:53.227,00:46:55.562,Try to put the past behind us.
00:47:03.487,00:47:06.365,"They say the past is etched in stone, but it isn't."
00:47:07.782,00:47:13.747,"It's... smoke trapped in a closed room, swirling..."
00:47:13.830,00:47:15.124,changing.
00:47:16.458,00:47:21.171,Buffeted by the passing of years and wishful thinking.
00:47:23.507,00:47:28.220,"But even though our perception of it changes, one thing remains constant."
00:47:29.263,00:47:30.931,The past can...
00:47:32.057,00:47:35.102,never be completely erased. It lingers.
00:47:37.646,00:47:39.940,Like the scent of burning wood.
00:47:48.198,00:47:49.283,Sir?
00:47:50.575,00:47:52.327,"Yes, passenger side."
00:47:55.664,00:47:56.873,Mmm.
00:47:59.376,00:48:01.795,He'd like to have a word with you.
00:48:36.455,00:48:38.123,You embarrassed me.
00:48:38.790,00:48:40.917,You embarrassed me in front of her.
00:50:22.227,00:50:25.314,Tell Mr. Potter I'll need a new suit.
00:50:31.320,00:50:32.904,What about this?
00:50:33.822,00:50:36.408,Take what's left of him and send it to his brother.
00:50:37.701,00:50:39.369,It'll start a war.
00:50:41.413,00:50:43.123,I'm counting on it.
00:06:24.676,00:06:26.719,It's me again. Call me back.
00:06:26.803,00:06:27.887,Shithead.
00:07:18.312,00:07:20.064,We found him.
00:07:30.533,00:07:31.784,Where?
00:07:31.868,00:07:33.369,He was dumped in the lot around the corner.
00:07:45.006,00:07:46.340,My brother.
00:07:48.510,00:07:50.177,My brother.
00:07:54.140,00:07:57.059,We should have returned to Moscow. Like you wanted...
00:08:15.119,00:08:16.538,He sends us a message.
00:08:17.664,00:08:19.373,Put every man we have on the street.
00:08:19.456,00:08:21.543,Find him.
00:08:24.504,00:08:26.506,And bring me his head.
00:13:52.248,00:13:53.790,Shut up.
00:13:55.167,00:13:57.128,Ask him about the man in the mask.
00:14:14.645,00:14:17.231,"Piotr, the guy's an idiot."
00:14:19.566,00:14:20.817,Let's go.
00:34:30.443,00:34:34.947,Tell the men to pull back and get ready.
00:34:35.030,00:34:38.493,"Guns, rifles, grenades. All of it."
00:35:09.940,00:35:12.402,"We will honor you, my brother..."
00:35:15.696,00:35:17.282,with the blood of war.
00:44:17.529,00:44:18.823,Vladimir...
00:44:18.906,00:44:21.533,Turk just got a call. We know where Fisk is.
00:44:22.492,00:44:23.577,Tell the men...
00:44:23.661,00:44:25.996,and no one touches Fisk.
00:44:26.080,00:44:27.081,He is mine.
00:48:16.851,00:48:18.228,The men are ready at the other locations?
00:48:18.312,00:48:19.563,They're waiting for the call.
00:48:22.024,00:48:23.150,Make it.
00:48:31.241,00:48:33.118,We expecting another delivery from Gao?
00:52:05.830,00:52:06.831,We must go! Quickly.
00:53:24.033,00:53:26.035,You are hurt.
00:53:26.119,00:53:27.246,I will live.
00:53:27.329,00:53:32.208,And see Fisk and his masked dog pay for what they did.
00:00:58.100,00:01:00.768,"Nah, just the ones that keep me alive."
00:01:04.231,00:01:06.274,You have a job or something to get to?
00:01:06.358,00:01:11.279,"Or are you one of those billionaire playboys No, I have a job."
00:01:11.363,00:01:14.491,"Damn, thought I'd lucked out."
00:01:15.700,00:01:16.826,What do you do?
00:01:16.909,00:01:21.373,"Lawyer. I have a practice, so... my own boss."
00:01:21.456,00:01:24.126,"Lawyer by day, vigilante by night."
00:01:25.252,00:01:26.253,The hell does that work?
00:01:34.886,00:01:36.095,"Oh, shit."
00:01:36.179,00:01:37.680,You just opened one of the cuts on your back.
00:01:39.266,00:01:41.309,How do you know that?
00:01:41.393,00:01:43.311,I can taste copper in the air.
00:01:46.773,00:01:48.650,Copper in the air.
00:01:51.986,00:01:53.155,May I?
00:01:54.281,00:01:56.408,"Knock yourself out, Houdini."
00:02:11.339,00:02:13.090,The swelling's down.
00:02:14.801,00:02:17.720,Rib fracture's only a hairline. I couldn't tell before.
00:02:17.804,00:02:20.723,You have X-ray fingers now?
00:02:22.517,00:02:25.437,I can hear your bones shift when you breathe.
00:02:25.520,00:02:27.522,No grinding means nothing's broken.
00:02:27.605,00:02:30.483,What does a hairline fracture sound like?
00:02:34.237,00:02:35.447,An old ship.
00:02:37.782,00:02:38.783,How do you...
00:02:38.866,00:02:45.081,"I mean, I know that you're blind, but you... see so much."
00:02:48.418,00:02:49.919,How?
00:02:50.878,00:02:54.674,I guess you have to think of it as more than just five senses.
00:02:57.260,00:03:00.347,"I can't see, not like everyone else, but I can feel."
00:03:00.430,00:03:03.766,Things like balance and direction.
00:03:05.602,00:03:11.148,"Micro-changes in air density, vibrations, blankets of temperature variations."
00:03:13.693,00:03:16.153,"Mix all that with what I hear, subtle smells."
00:03:17.239,00:03:19.907,All of the fragments form a sort of...
00:03:21.409,00:03:23.536,impressionistic painting.
00:03:25.247,00:03:28.124,"Okay, but what does that look like?"
00:03:29.834,00:03:31.419,"Like, what do you..."
00:03:32.795,00:03:34.506,actually see?
00:03:37.967,00:03:39.511,A world on fire.
00:03:50.647,00:03:53.816,"If all I saw was fire, I'd probably want to hit people, too."
00:03:55.109,00:03:58.321,I just wish I knew I was hitting the right ones.
00:03:59.364,00:04:00.573,Claire...
00:04:02.534,00:04:05.077,they know who you are now.
00:04:05.161,00:04:06.579,And they're not going to stop.
00:04:08.080,00:04:10.500,"I'd like you to stay here, with me..."
00:04:11.501,00:04:13.878,just till I figure something out.
00:04:19.551,00:04:21.428,That's a hell of a way to get a girl to move in.
00:04:21.511,00:04:23.305,"It worked, didn't it?"
00:05:03.428,00:05:06.473,I was wondering if you were ever gonna do that.
00:05:07.974,00:05:10.226,"Well, I've been a little busy."
00:05:12.269,00:05:15.482,I'll get you some clothes while I'm out.
00:05:22.864,00:05:24.907,Why don't you go to the police?
00:05:24.991,00:05:27.494,With all that you have on the Russians?
00:05:27.577,00:05:29.621,I wear a mask and beat on people.
00:05:29.704,00:05:32.540,Doesn't exactly mesh with police policy.
00:05:34.291,00:05:36.794,you try to take down the entire Russian mob yourself.
00:05:36.878,00:05:38.295,Maybe I only need to take down one man.
00:05:38.380,00:05:39.547,Fisk?
00:05:39.631,00:05:42.592,"Cut off the head of the snake, the body dies."
00:05:42.675,00:05:46.763,How do you know he's the head of the snake if you can't find anything on him?
00:05:46.846,00:05:48.139,There was a murder in a bowling alley.
00:05:48.222,00:05:52.477,A man named Prohaszka. Owned a majority in Kitchen Cabs.
00:05:52.560,00:05:54.771,They were turning those over in the garage they took me to.
00:05:54.854,00:05:58.775,"Right, I think Fisk hired the man that killed Prohaszka."
00:05:58.858,00:06:00.485,Everything leads back to him...
00:06:03.655,00:06:05.990,Maybe you are beating on the wrong people.
00:06:07.074,00:06:08.993,"I heard a name, when they were..."
00:06:11.037,00:06:14.248,The prick with the baseball bat reacted when he heard it.
00:06:14.331,00:06:16.584,Like a dog when you yank his leash.
00:06:17.502,00:06:18.586,What was the name?
00:06:21.506,00:06:22.799,Vladimir.
00:06:35.645,00:06:37.188,My employer sends his regards.
00:06:37.271,00:06:40.024,And his gratitude that his offer was accepted.
00:06:40.107,00:06:44.612,There are still a few small details we'd like to iron out before...
00:06:46.197,00:06:47.824,"Uh, where's your brother?"
00:06:47.907,00:06:50.452,This is a thing I was going to ask you.
00:06:51.494,00:07:00.712,"Last time I saw him, he was heading to see Mr.-- He practically kissed me when we agreed to terms."
00:07:00.795,00:07:04.591,He have a girl or... a boy he might be celebrating with?
00:07:04.674,00:07:05.758,You try his cell?
00:07:05.842,00:07:07.969,-He does not answer. -Try again.
00:07:08.052,00:07:11.556,We need to lock this down and get distribution back to acceptable levels.
00:09:44.333,00:09:47.044,Anyone else wondering about this?
00:10:01.225,00:10:04.979,Why aren't we meeting in the usual place? And what's all this?
00:10:08.149,00:10:10.109,for those willing to seize it.
00:10:18.993,00:10:20.327,She's happy to see you.
00:10:23.205,00:10:24.624,My apologies...
00:10:26.583,00:10:27.960,for my absence of late.
00:10:28.044,00:10:30.880,And for calling you here on little notice.
00:10:30.963,00:10:34.258,Where are the Smiley Twins? Sleeping off another kidnapping?
00:10:34.341,00:10:37.679,The Ranskahovs are no longer a part of this organization.
00:10:37.762,00:10:38.763,Since when?
00:10:40.347,00:10:44.769,Since I removed Anatoly's head... with my car door.
00:10:48.648,00:10:50.858,She's upset they weren't consulted.
00:10:53.402,00:10:54.779,He isn't happy either.
00:10:55.780,00:10:58.658,Deal me in on that. What the hell happened?
00:11:03.579,00:11:05.915,It was a personal matter.
00:11:06.833,00:11:09.001,What? That's...
00:11:10.962,00:11:14.631,Vladimir isn't exactly a hug-it-out kind of guy.
00:11:14.716,00:11:19.804,The masked vigilante killed his brother. At least that's what Vladimir believes.
00:11:24.683,00:11:29.188,We all knew that we would need to eliminate the Russians one day.
00:11:30.898,00:11:32.734,They were too unpredictable.
00:11:32.817,00:11:36.195,This from a guy taking heads off with a car door.
00:11:41.033,00:11:43.828,She wants to know how her product is going to be moved now.
00:11:45.496,00:11:50.209,"keep sending your deliveries to the Russians, as though nothing has changed."
00:11:50.292,00:11:53.420,"And when this is all over, I'll assume their responsibility."
00:11:53.504,00:11:56.966,And move their share to your column in the ledger?
00:12:00.344,00:12:03.180,"A rising tide raises all boats, Leland."
00:12:03.264,00:12:06.142,Profits will be divided up equally among us.
00:12:07.226,00:12:09.812,"Four shares, instead of five."
00:12:25.661,00:12:26.871,Leland?
00:12:28.330,00:12:31.250,"What, I'm going against the three of you?"
00:12:32.251,00:12:33.836,I like my head where it's at.
00:12:38.549,00:12:40.509,until I'm ready to move on Vladimir.
00:12:40.592,00:12:44.138,And what if he finds out the truth before that happens?
00:12:46.432,00:12:48.767,That would be unfortunate for all of us.
00:12:53.314,00:12:55.524,I'm getting my stun gun out of storage.
00:12:59.528,00:13:01.530,Remember your promise to me...
00:13:01.613,00:13:03.657,and those I speak for.
00:13:13.250,00:13:14.919,may I walk you to your car?
00:13:22.634,00:13:23.970,She thinks you want something.
00:13:28.933,00:13:32.144,I want to put this behind us...
00:13:33.479,00:13:35.397,as quickly as possible.
00:13:59.838,00:14:02.174,Man in black mask... you know?
00:14:03.717,00:14:06.012,Any of you Gao's runners know anything?
00:14:07.596,00:14:09.848,I'm talking to you!
00:15:48.239,00:15:49.323,Huh?
00:16:34.451,00:16:36.078,"-Where's Vladimir? -No, please!"
00:16:36.162,00:16:37.288,Vladimir! Where is he?
00:16:37.371,00:16:39.790,"Please, I'll tell you what you want! Just don't cut my head off!"
00:16:39.873,00:16:41.042,What are you talking about?
00:16:41.125,00:16:44.586,Vladimir's brother. Everyone knows you took his head.
00:16:51.343,00:16:53.762,On the ground! On the ground!
00:17:04.065,00:17:05.566,Be advised two on foot.
00:17:05.649,00:17:07.109,One en route to the 15th.
00:17:12.198,00:17:13.740,You don't make any sense!
00:17:16.910,00:17:18.829,"Whoa, be nice to it."
00:17:18.912,00:17:20.997,"You know, for when the machines take over."
00:17:21.082,00:17:23.584,I can't get any of this crap I bought to work.
00:17:25.252,00:17:27.629,All I hear when I try to dial is a bunch of clicks.
00:17:27.713,00:17:31.007,"Could be the machines plotting, but I don't speak computer overlord."
00:17:31.092,00:17:33.009,"-No, it's the rats. -The who what now?"
00:17:33.927,00:17:35.471,They chewed through the main line.
00:17:38.182,00:17:40.434,We have rats now. I'm never sleeping here again.
00:17:41.352,00:17:42.394,Then there's an upside.
00:17:43.562,00:17:46.065,"Hey, you guys hear anything on the news about a Russian getting his head cut off?"
00:17:46.148,00:17:47.441,In Hell's Kitchen?
00:17:47.524,00:17:50.236,"This city. Bad enough you get mugged, now they chop your melon off."
00:17:50.319,00:17:52.779,"What's next, groping corpses?"
00:17:56.283,00:17:57.618,"Is this, um..."
00:17:58.619,00:18:01.037,Señor Foggy law?
00:18:02.456,00:18:04.166,Bess Mahoney? Brett's mom?
00:18:04.250,00:18:06.127,"Sí, she refer me."
00:18:08.962,00:18:10.256,Something about cigars?
00:18:10.339,00:18:12.091,You know Spanish?
00:18:12.174,00:18:13.884,"Oh, just what I remember from high school."
00:18:13.967,00:18:16.052,"Mrs. Cardenas, tell us what happened."
00:18:17.763,00:18:21.475,Mi casa es rent-control.
00:18:22.393,00:18:25.061,"But the landlord, Señor Tully..."
00:18:25.146,00:18:28.524,Armand Tully? Sleaze bag owns buildings all over town.
00:18:28.607,00:18:31.026,"Sí, y señor Tully..."
00:18:37.032,00:18:40.286,He wants to convert the apartments to condominiums.
00:18:44.831,00:18:48.252,Men came weeks ago. They said that they were workers.
00:18:50.296,00:18:53.174,And they destroyed the apartments with a-- I don't know that last word.
00:18:53.257,00:18:54.466,Sledgehammers.
00:18:55.634,00:18:56.843,College.
00:18:56.927,00:19:00.055,"You ever have a client that wants to chat in Punjabi, I'm your man."
00:19:00.139,00:19:01.307,Um...
00:19:01.390,00:19:02.683,Do you want to do this?
00:19:02.766,00:19:04.685,"No, no. I like listening to your voice."
00:19:08.230,00:19:09.648,"Go on, Mrs. Cardenas."
00:19:09.731,00:19:13.026,"There is damage, en todas partes."
00:19:13.109,00:19:14.486,Everywhere.
00:19:17.698,00:19:20.159,They have no working sinks or pipes.
00:19:20.242,00:19:23.245,They don't have water or electricity for days.
00:19:23.329,00:19:26.457,We call policía. We speak to the officer.
00:19:27.999,00:19:31.712,"-The police couldn't help. -Policía say, It is a city issue."
00:19:33.672,00:19:35.924,They don't know what to do.
00:19:36.007,00:19:41.347,"This says Tully offered them 10,000 to give up their rent control and vacate the premises."
00:19:41.430,00:19:44.266,Maybe we can pressure him into giving a better payout.
00:19:44.350,00:19:46.477,"No, Señor Foggy."
00:19:46.560,00:19:51.482,We do no want money. We want to stay in our homes.
00:20:13.545,00:20:15.214,I heard you say my name. Why'd you say my name?
00:20:15.297,00:20:19.175,I told her you're going to talk to Tully's lawyer.
00:20:19.260,00:20:21.803,Tully's lawyer? Do you know who reps him?
00:20:24.014,00:20:27.684,"Landman and Zack! Landman and mother-freakin' Zack, man!"
00:20:27.768,00:20:30.937,"Ooh, sounds impressive. Are they looking to hire?"
00:20:31.021,00:20:33.607,"Oh, you wouldn't be happy. We used to intern there."
00:20:33.690,00:20:34.983,"Oh, right."
00:20:35.066,00:20:36.985,"And they offered us a job, a great job."
00:20:37.068,00:20:40.947,Which we turned down to go off and save the world. Now they hate us.
00:20:41.031,00:20:43.199,We'll need to load for bear if we're gonna take them on.
00:20:43.284,00:20:45.536,I'll hit the precinct to check for complaints against Tully.
00:20:45.619,00:20:47.371,I can't go to L and Z alone.
00:20:47.454,00:20:50.916,"They're gonna shark attack me, Matt. Look at me, I'm delicious."
00:20:50.999,00:20:52.376,"Well, take Karen."
00:20:56.963,00:20:58.214,Oh...
00:20:58.299,00:20:59.633,sure.
00:20:59.716,00:21:01.593,Never seen sharks feed up close before.
00:21:03.387,00:21:05.722,Try not to splash too much. It attracts 'em.
00:21:18.277,00:21:20.946,Look who it is... Murdock.
00:21:21.738,00:21:23.782,Sergeant... how's your mom?
00:21:23.865,00:21:26.785,"Smells like a stogie. Otherwise, um..."
00:21:28.329,00:21:30.622,"Yeah, I keep telling Foggy not to get her cigars, but..."
00:21:30.706,00:21:34.084,She'd sneak 'em one way or the other. Crafty old bird.
00:21:34.167,00:21:36.252,"Right, it's why I'm here."
00:21:36.337,00:21:38.171,Friend of hers has a case we're looking into.
00:21:38.254,00:21:40.215,You going after Tully?
00:21:40.299,00:21:41.342,"Yeah, you know him?"
00:21:41.425,00:21:44.345,"Yeah. Yeah, guy's a real scumbag."
00:21:44.428,00:21:47.473,"But he stays just this side of ordinance, so there's nothing we can do."
00:21:47.556,00:21:49.057,Can you pull some copies of the complaints?
00:21:49.140,00:21:50.976,Maybe get me a minute or two with the officers who took them?
00:21:51.059,00:21:52.478,You really think you and Foggy can help?
00:21:52.561,00:21:53.979,"Yeah, we can try."
00:21:55.356,00:21:56.565,Let me see what I can find.
00:21:56.648,00:21:57.983,Thank you.
00:22:17.210,00:22:20.088,"We have you at the scene with a dead Chinese illegal, Piotr."
00:22:20.171,00:22:21.465,And a backpack full of drugs.
00:22:21.548,00:22:25.677,"Uh-oh, that'll buy you a one-way ticket to 30 years in Asshole Land."
00:22:28.096,00:22:31.642,You boys do that to yourselves or do you all get shirtless and poke each other?
00:22:31.725,00:22:33.435,Do you know who I work for?
00:22:33.519,00:22:36.146,Couple of dipshit brothers nobody gives a wank about.
00:22:37.648,00:22:40.484,"Bye-bye, dickhead. Enjoy your next 30."
00:22:41.777,00:22:42.903,Wait.
00:22:46.907,00:22:48.492,What if I give you another name?
00:22:48.575,00:22:50.869,...give you another name?
00:22:50.952,00:22:52.328,He'd have to be big.
00:22:52.413,00:22:54.247,He'd have to be King freakin' Kong.
00:22:57.375,00:22:58.544,He is.
00:23:05.008,00:23:06.259,is Wilson Fisk.
00:23:06.342,00:23:07.636,...Wilson Fisk.
00:23:18.104,00:23:21.191,"-Well, what else you know about this guy? -Not much."
00:23:22.693,00:23:25.612,No one even supposed to say his name.
00:23:25.696,00:23:28.949,But I will tell you everything I know... for deal.
00:23:40.961,00:23:42.796,-Whose turn is it? -Yours.
00:23:44.047,00:23:46.424,I thought I took it for that thing in the bodega?
00:23:46.508,00:23:47.634,"Oh, shit, yeah."
00:23:49.302,00:23:50.679,"All right, wait, wait."
00:23:52.639,00:23:54.140,"Okay, go on."
00:23:57.352,00:23:58.937,"Watch out! Jeez, he's going for my gun!"
00:23:59.020,00:24:00.230,Watch out!
00:24:03.358,00:24:05.486,You really shouldn't have said his name.
00:24:17.205,00:24:19.583,We got shots fired...
00:24:28.341,00:24:32.178,Feels like a place in a movie where you'd buy a clone...
00:24:32.262,00:24:34.097,or maybe a robot baby.
00:24:38.351,00:24:42.147,I'm Foggy Nelson. I called earlier. I represent Ms. Cardenas.
00:24:43.940,00:24:45.776,"Look at you, still playing lawyer."
00:24:45.859,00:24:47.193,What are you doing here?
00:24:49.655,00:24:51.573,"Uh, Karen Page."
00:24:51.657,00:24:53.283,"Wait, you work here, at Landman and Zack?"
00:24:53.366,00:24:55.827,"Mmm, came on right after you and Murdock crashed and burned."
00:24:55.911,00:24:57.453,-We didn't... -Where is your sidekick?
00:24:57.538,00:24:59.289,"Didn't break it off with him already, did you?"
00:24:59.372,00:25:02.125,-Fog has commitment issues. -I don't have...
00:25:02.208,00:25:04.419,Matt is taking care of something.
00:25:04.502,00:25:06.421,It was very nice to see you. We have an appointment.
00:25:06.504,00:25:08.423,I know. It's with me.
00:25:10.175,00:25:11.802,You're Armand Tully's lawyer?
00:25:11.885,00:25:15.346,"Just part of the team. They're all tied up with real work, so..."
00:25:15.430,00:25:20.561,"All right, let's go upstairs and-- Oh, we'd be finished before the elevator stopped."
00:25:20.644,00:25:24.314,Your client can agree to a buyout or live in squalor till she's evicted.
00:25:25.566,00:25:28.860,Those workmen acted illegally. They busted the place up.
00:25:28.944,00:25:31.112,They were making requested repairs.
00:25:31.196,00:25:32.698,-Which they never finished. -Yeah.
00:25:32.781,00:25:35.033,-And did Mrs. Carnitas tell you-- -Cardenas.
00:25:37.118,00:25:40.538,Did she tell you why the workmen left before completing the repairs?
00:25:40.622,00:25:43.584,"-No, she just said-- -They feared for their safety."
00:25:43.667,00:25:46.544,-From an old woman? -From a criminal element.
00:25:46.628,00:25:50.006,Her building is filled with junkies and drug dealers.
00:25:50.090,00:25:52.634,We're doing the city a favor by trying to renovate.
00:25:52.718,00:25:53.760,You know that's not true.
00:25:53.844,00:25:56.638,"Yeah, because the law's always about the truth."
00:25:57.639,00:25:59.808,"Look, you know how this goes."
00:25:59.891,00:26:04.938,"It's her word versus my client's, and there's a whole backlog of these cases pending throughout the city."
00:26:05.021,00:26:07.273,No one is going to help her but us.
00:26:07.357,00:26:14.489,"If I were you, I'd go to Mrs. Whatever today and strongly urge her to accept our offer."
00:26:16.074,00:26:17.242,Marci.
00:26:19.828,00:26:23.248,Convincing my client to agree to your terms... that's your job.
00:26:23.331,00:26:24.499,And I'm not going to do it for you.
00:26:24.582,00:26:26.376,"See, you think there are only two options."
00:26:26.459,00:26:29.671,"These tenants take the payout and leave, or leave without taking it."
00:26:29.755,00:26:38.554,"But given how long they've put up with Tully's bullshit, I think you're actually afraid that Mrs. Cardenas and her neighbors will find a way to eke by."
00:26:40.807,00:26:43.601,and very illegally forcing tenants from their rent-controlled homes...
00:26:43.685,00:26:45.729,Armand Tully loses his condos.
00:26:45.812,00:26:48.023,Your firm loses Tully.
00:26:48.106,00:26:50.483,And that's very bad for business.
00:26:50.566,00:26:54.655,"You want me and my client to think that you're doing us a favor, that we have no leverage."
00:26:54.738,00:26:56.614,"When really, we have all of it."
00:26:57.573,00:26:59.660,So you're gonna see us in court...
00:26:59.743,00:27:06.124,"where I will absolutely dismantle you, from the top of your salon blowout to the bottom of your overpriced pumps."
00:27:10.586,00:27:12.338,"You would've killed it here, Foggy Bear."
00:27:13.924,00:27:15.425,You never should have left.
00:27:16.009,00:27:18.511,"You never should have signed on, Marce."
00:27:18.594,00:27:21.347,"You were really something, back in the day."
00:27:21.431,00:27:22.808,When you had a soul.
00:27:25.060,00:27:26.311,Foggy Bear?
00:27:26.394,00:27:28.104,We used to date.
00:27:28.188,00:27:29.355,You dated that?
00:27:29.439,00:27:31.900,"-Yep, let's step a little faster. -Oh, my God."
00:27:40.366,00:27:43.704,Our contacts in IAB will make it go away.
00:27:44.871,00:27:47.457,Had there been someone else in that room with that Russian...
00:27:47.540,00:27:49.835,There wasn't.
00:27:49.918,00:27:51.211,It was our people.
00:27:51.294,00:27:52.587,This time.
00:27:53.588,00:27:57.718,Soon Vladimir won't have any comrades to whisper your name to.
00:28:04.515,00:28:07.185,The '75 Brunello di Montalcino.
00:28:08.854,00:28:10.856,It's a personal favorite.
00:28:12.107,00:28:13.775,"Thank you, Wesley."
00:28:41.845,00:28:42.971,Jesus.
00:28:50.896,00:28:52.397,Señor Tully...
00:28:53.774,00:28:54.941,fix?
00:28:55.942,00:28:57.986,"No, not yet."
00:28:59.237,00:29:02.032,"But Karen and I, we're going to do what we can."
00:29:02.115,00:29:03.324,We are?
00:29:04.575,00:29:05.660,Why not?
00:29:09.247,00:29:10.373,At least get the ball rolling.
00:29:10.456,00:29:13.126,"-And your cousin's a drywall guy, right? -That he is."
00:29:13.209,00:29:16.212,And Matt and I fished an electrician out of the drunk tank.
00:29:16.296,00:29:17.798,Owes us a favor.
00:29:17.881,00:29:20.091,"We're gonna talk to your neighbors, too, okay, Mrs. Cardenas?"
00:29:20.175,00:29:21.676,We're gonna take care of you.
00:29:51.247,00:29:52.999,You killed that Russian in interrogation.
00:29:53.083,00:29:54.542,"I had no choice, he jumped my partner."
00:29:55.794,00:29:57.587,You lie to me and I hurt you.
00:29:57.670,00:30:00.506,"You killed him 'cause he said a name, Wilson Fisk."
00:30:00.590,00:30:01.591,I don't know what you're talking about.
00:30:02.968,00:30:04.385,"Okay, okay!"
00:30:06.429,00:30:09.515,"I shot him 'cause he said a name, so what?"
00:30:09.599,00:30:11.267,"What I hear, you like to kill Russians too."
00:30:11.351,00:30:13.353,You chopped Anatoly's head off.
00:30:14.437,00:30:15.563,And now I want his brother.
00:30:16.564,00:30:17.773,I don't know where he is!
00:30:20.193,00:30:23.154,I swear! I swear! I swear! Please. Please.
00:30:30.203,00:30:31.579,How are Fisk and the Russians connected?
00:30:31.662,00:30:33.123,Why did he kill Prohaszka for them?
00:30:34.707,00:30:35.708,Why?
00:30:35.791,00:30:37.543,You don't know?
00:30:37.627,00:30:38.837,"Oh, man."
00:30:39.795,00:30:42.090,"You really are one stupid son of a bitch, aren't you?"
00:30:56.562,00:30:58.273,"-Good evening, madam. -Hello."
00:30:58.356,00:30:59.983,"This way, please."
00:31:12.370,00:31:14.414,I didn't know if you would show.
00:31:14.497,00:31:15.999,Neither did I.
00:31:17.292,00:31:18.919,I thought you didn't go in for grand gestures.
00:31:19.002,00:31:20.628,"No, it isn't..."
00:31:21.796,00:31:23.839,I didn't want to be interrupted again.
00:31:23.924,00:31:26.342,We can go somewhere else if you like.
00:31:26.426,00:31:28.887,And if I just want to walk out that door by myself?
00:31:29.512,00:31:31.722,Then I would dine alone.
00:31:32.891,00:31:34.267,It wouldn't be the first time.
00:31:35.977,00:31:38.897,I've been lied to before... by men.
00:31:41.399,00:31:43.693,Some were even decent ones...
00:31:43.776,00:31:46.862,but they still felt the need to be dishonest...
00:31:47.989,00:31:50.075,about things that mattered.
00:31:53.369,00:31:57.248,Do you feel that need... Wilson?
00:32:00.335,00:32:02.545,I don't like to be in public.
00:32:05.256,00:32:07.342,And I don't like to be questioned.
00:32:10.178,00:32:12.430,"But you can ask me anything, Vanessa."
00:32:13.431,00:32:16.101,And I will always be honest with you.
00:32:18.686,00:32:21.106,Let's start with something simple.
00:32:24.275,00:32:26.319,What are we drinking?
00:32:37.372,00:32:39.665,the '75 Brunello di Montalcino.
00:33:04.024,00:33:06.359,"Hey, sorry about your..."
00:33:13.574,00:33:15.576,Sergei tells me you know something.
00:33:16.536,00:33:19.830,Something about the man who took my brother from me.
00:33:20.915,00:33:22.125,"Yeah, uh..."
00:33:24.710,00:33:29.674,"Look, I know this guy, we did a stretch in Rikers."
00:33:29.757,00:33:33.553,Getting by now at a chop shop on the edge of the Kitchen.
00:33:33.636,00:33:36.139,Told me an SUV came in yesterday.
00:33:36.764,00:33:38.933,Black... expensive...
00:33:39.017,00:33:42.478,backseat all splattered with blood and...
00:33:46.066,00:33:47.525,brains.
00:33:55.033,00:33:58.244,This car... who does it belong to?
00:33:59.204,00:34:01.872,Some big white guy...
00:34:01.956,00:34:03.124,bald as shit.
00:34:04.625,00:34:07.462,"-Fisk? -Didn't get a name, but..."
00:34:07.545,00:34:13.134,my boy said he heard baldy say something about that guy in the black mask.
00:34:14.219,00:34:16.096,Couldn't make it all out...
00:34:16.846,00:34:20.058,but sounds like he and this mask dude are tight.
00:34:21.184,00:34:22.435,He works for Fisk.
00:34:23.353,00:34:26.522,"All this time, Fisk has been playing us..."
00:34:27.898,00:34:29.484,planning this.
00:34:50.713,00:34:51.881,tonight.
00:34:51.964,00:34:53.299,1 mil?
00:34:54.509,00:34:57.595,Shit... I'm on it!
00:35:19.617,00:35:21.494,"Okay, try it now."
00:35:26.457,00:35:28.584,"Okay, yeah!"
00:35:28.668,00:35:30.336,I admit it. I'm impressed.
00:35:31.879,00:35:34.048,"Hot still doesn't work, but at least it's a start."
00:35:38.052,00:35:40.430,"You, Señor Foggy, you..."
00:35:40.513,00:35:42.223,"You stay, we eat."
00:35:42.307,00:35:44.225,"-No, Mrs. Cardenas... -You stay."
00:35:44.309,00:35:46.394,"There is no no happen, okay?"
00:35:48.438,00:35:51.023,-You want to eat? -Be rude not to.
00:35:51.106,00:35:54.735,"Mi madre make this, all the time in Guatemala."
00:35:55.653,00:35:59.490,"Now I make para ustedes, como gracias."
00:35:59.574,00:36:03.077,"Mrs. Cardenas, where did you make this? You don't have any gas."
00:36:03.161,00:36:05.955,I cook in apartamento downstairs.
00:36:06.747,00:36:09.792,"Aquí, we take care for another."
00:36:19.719,00:36:21.887,Did she just...
00:36:21.971,00:36:24.224,Did she... Is this a date?
00:36:24.307,00:36:25.433,Uh...
00:36:27.352,00:36:30.313,"I sort of think it is, Señor Foggy."
00:36:37.403,00:36:39.655,There're no numbers in this... no contacts.
00:36:39.739,00:36:42.408,It's a burner. Like the one I use to talk to you.
00:36:43.409,00:36:45.035,It was buzzing. Did someone leave a message?
00:36:45.119,00:36:46.371,Um...
00:36:46.454,00:36:48.080,"No, a text."
00:36:48.163,00:36:49.957,What's it say?
00:36:50.040,00:36:52.460,It's a list of locations.
00:36:52.543,00:36:53.794,Four of them.
00:36:53.878,00:36:57.089,47th and 12th. 48th and 9th.
00:36:57.172,00:37:00.760,42nd and 10th. 44th and 11th.
00:37:00.843,00:37:02.928,-44th and 11th? -Yeah.
00:37:04.555,00:37:06.056,Troika Restaurant.
00:37:06.140,00:37:07.392,Where they were holding that boy?
00:37:07.475,00:37:09.894,"These addresses, they're listing where the Russians are."
00:37:11.145,00:37:12.938,-The hell did you get this? -Cop.
00:37:13.939,00:37:16.901,"-I said go to the police, I didn't mean... -Nah, he was working for Fisk."
00:37:16.984,00:37:18.611,"Killed a Russian for him, right inside the precinct."
00:37:20.530,00:37:22.907,I'm betting I'll find Vladimir at one of them.
00:37:22.990,00:37:24.992,"Matt, wait, just..."
00:37:26.786,00:37:27.912,What are you going to do?
00:37:28.621,00:37:29.955,Whatever it takes.
00:37:30.706,00:37:32.333,"You know how that sounds, right?"
00:37:36.337,00:37:39.924,"Um, when we were on that roof you told that Russian..."
00:37:41.091,00:37:43.386,that you hurt people because you enjoy it.
00:37:43.469,00:37:45.513,And you said you didn't believe that.
00:37:45.596,00:37:47.598,I can't believe that.
00:37:47.682,00:37:50.768,"Because if I do, that means you're not the man..."
00:37:50.851,00:37:51.977,that I believe you to be.
00:37:52.061,00:37:53.771,I need to be the man this city needs.
00:37:53.854,00:37:55.606,"Hey, that's not a reason, it's an excuse."
00:37:55.690,00:37:57.317,"What do you want me to do, Claire?"
00:37:57.400,00:37:58.984,Let them tear Hell's Kitchen apart?
00:38:00.486,00:38:01.946,Let them win?
00:38:03.030,00:38:07.117,What you do is important... to so many people. I get that.
00:38:11.956,00:38:15.000,I just don't think I can let myself fall in love with someone...
00:38:17.211,00:38:19.589,who's so damn close to becoming what he hates.
00:38:21.507,00:38:22.592,You're right...
00:38:25.595,00:38:27.221,you shouldn't.
00:38:41.276,00:38:42.487,A prince?
00:38:44.489,00:38:48.743,He saw me at an exhibition. I was the curator and traveling with it...
00:38:48.826,00:38:50.870,and all of a sudden...
00:38:51.954,00:38:55.375,this tall man in a white suit and an ascot...
00:38:55.458,00:38:57.292,An ascot? That's a bit much.
00:38:57.377,00:38:58.669,That's what I was thinking.
00:39:00.087,00:39:03.424,"He sidles up to me... I love that word, sidle."
00:39:10.390,00:39:13.434,"I knew it was a line, but it worked."
00:39:13.518,00:39:14.894,I slept with him.
00:39:20.441,00:39:21.651,Does that shock you?
00:39:25.613,00:39:30.200,You're a very attractive woman. I assumed you've had lovers.
00:39:30.284,00:39:31.494,That's not what I asked.
00:39:34.246,00:39:35.415,Then why'd you look away?
00:39:36.541,00:39:39.585,Because I wish I had said something like that to you when we first met.
00:39:42.380,00:39:43.923,I'm glad you didn't.
00:39:51.847,00:39:54.684,This wine's even better than the last one.
00:39:54.767,00:39:56.351,Did you pick it?
00:39:58.438,00:40:00.773,I've never had it. My assistant.
00:40:04.652,00:40:06.111,I said I'd be honest.
00:40:06.195,00:40:07.447,You did.
00:40:08.656,00:40:10.991,Wesley's more than an assistant...
00:40:12.868,00:40:14.244,he's my friend.
00:40:14.328,00:40:15.538,So you do have those.
00:40:17.122,00:40:21.752,Yet the man says he was lonely when he looked at my painting.
00:40:21.836,00:40:23.295,My painting.
00:40:27.467,00:40:28.551,Yes.
00:40:29.927,00:40:31.261,Thank you.
00:40:33.973,00:40:36.601,So why does a man like you feel alone?
00:40:37.810,00:40:39.311,"Nature of my business, I suppose."
00:40:41.522,00:40:43.107,And what kind of business is that?
00:40:46.486,00:40:48.529,Rebuilding this city.
00:40:49.905,00:40:52.908,I want to carve something beautiful out of its ugliness...
00:40:52.992,00:40:54.702,set free its potential.
00:40:55.453,00:40:56.746,You sound like an artist.
00:40:56.829,00:40:59.039,I'm just a man with a dream.
00:40:59.123,00:41:01.416,What do you think an artist is?
00:41:03.335,00:41:04.962,Are those the only ones you have?
00:41:05.630,00:41:07.715,You were wearing them last time.
00:41:09.717,00:41:11.010,They were my father's.
00:41:12.344,00:41:14.972,I wear them every day to remember him.
00:41:17.057,00:41:18.183,Did he pass?
00:41:18.267,00:41:20.019,When I was a boy.
00:41:22.855,00:41:24.690,May I ask you something now?
00:41:25.399,00:41:27.693,I'd say you've earned it.
00:41:30.488,00:41:32.490,What kind of gun is that you have in your purse?
00:41:41.582,00:41:42.708,It's a .22.
00:41:44.001,00:41:45.961,Did you think you would need that tonight?
00:41:47.212,00:41:50.049,We've been sitting here talking for hours...
00:41:52.009,00:41:56.221,and you're going to insult me like I have no idea what you really do?
00:41:58.182,00:41:59.600,What I said...
00:42:00.976,00:42:03.270,about what I want for this city is the truth.
00:42:05.523,00:42:10.611,But money and influence is not enough to usher change on such a scale.
00:42:14.031,00:42:16.283,I know you're a dangerous man.
00:42:23.498,00:42:24.667,Would you like to leave?
00:42:24.750,00:42:25.793,No...
00:42:26.752,00:42:28.879,I'd like a reason to stay.
00:42:37.387,00:42:41.642,"I've done things that I'm not proud of, Vanessa."
00:42:44.436,00:42:47.648,I've hurt people... and I'm going to hurt more.
00:42:50.442,00:42:53.696,It's impossible to avoid for what I'm trying to do.
00:42:55.364,00:42:57.074,But I take no pleasure in it...
00:42:58.325,00:42:59.994,in cruelty.
00:43:00.995,00:43:03.956,But this city isn't a caterpillar.
00:43:04.039,00:43:07.126,It doesn't spin a cocoon and wake up a butterfly.
00:43:08.043,00:43:12.840,A city... crumbles and fades.
00:43:15.676,00:43:18.888,It needs to die before it can be reborn.
00:43:22.892,00:43:24.852,So I don't need the gun?
00:43:28.397,00:43:29.857,"No, by my side..."
00:43:31.358,00:43:33.819,is the safest place that you could ever be.
00:44:29.541,00:44:38.092,"...and Matt bangs his cane around and says, -Where did you put his furniture? -Dorm room across the hall."
00:44:38.175,00:44:39.885,"Oh, God!"
00:44:39.969,00:44:42.096,"Oh, I really wish I knew you guys back then."
00:44:42.179,00:44:43.848,Much better off knowing us now.
00:44:43.931,00:44:45.725,We have our own practice.
00:44:45.808,00:44:48.853,I'm a hell of a lot more dashing than I was in my awkward college days.
00:44:48.936,00:44:52.564,"Oh, yeah? Well, I'm going to need photographic proof of that, counselor."
00:44:57.611,00:44:59.696,"Well, it's been about five minutes. You were due."
00:45:02.908,00:45:05.202,"You know, there's something I gotta know. It's killing me."
00:45:05.285,00:45:09.414,"No, I do not kiss on the first date. Sorry, not gonna happen."
00:45:09.498,00:45:10.833,No! No.
00:45:13.293,00:45:16.713,What's the deal with the meat grinder in the pencil skirt?
00:45:16.797,00:45:18.883,"No, she just... She doesn't seem like your type."
00:45:18.966,00:45:20.425,-Marci? -Yeah.
00:45:22.302,00:45:24.721,She was different back when I knew her.
00:45:25.680,00:45:28.100,"Or maybe she wasn't, I don't know."
00:45:28.183,00:45:32.855,"Matt's always getting involved with the wrong girl, so maybe he just rubbed off on me."
00:45:32.938,00:45:33.981,Huh.
00:45:35.190,00:45:36.817,Matt dates a lot?
00:45:38.027,00:45:40.112,I wouldn't exactly call it that.
00:45:41.030,00:45:43.115,He hasn't really been with anyone for more than a month or two.
00:45:43.908,00:45:45.034,Hmm.
00:45:46.451,00:45:47.661,It's kind of sad.
00:45:48.745,00:45:51.498,"On the plus side, he gets to touch a lot of pretty girls..."
00:45:51.581,00:45:53.167,on their faces.
00:45:53.250,00:45:56.796,"Um, that's, you know, how he tells what people look like."
00:45:56.879,00:45:59.256,Or at least that's what he tells the ladies.
00:45:59.339,00:46:04.303,"Although, he always seems to know which ones are hot before he puts his grubby little mitts on them."
00:46:09.850,00:46:11.518,Does he know what you look like?
00:46:12.561,00:46:14.396,He's got a rough idea.
00:46:15.480,00:46:19.609,"I only ever let him put his hands on my face once, 'cause... weird."
00:46:21.653,00:46:23.113,Are you gonna finish that?
00:46:23.197,00:46:24.364,"No, no."
00:46:28.743,00:46:30.787,You ever tell him what I look like?
00:46:37.377,00:46:40.797,He's probably got a picture of you in his head.
00:46:40.881,00:46:43.217,-I don't like to mess with those. -Oh...
00:46:46.345,00:46:47.721,"Hey, Foggy..."
00:46:51.558,00:46:53.685,I want you to touch my face.
00:46:56.313,00:47:01.068,"Um... but I can see you, so-- No, I... No, I know. I just, um..."
00:47:02.777,00:47:07.241,I want to know how someone who's blind would see me.
00:47:10.535,00:47:12.997,"Look, you do me then, then I'll do you."
00:47:15.332,00:47:16.666,"Yeah, okay."
00:48:52.804,00:48:54.306,You have to close your eyes.
00:48:54.389,00:48:55.557,Right.
00:49:01.063,00:49:02.939,Just tell me what you feel.
00:49:26.588,00:49:28.507,What is happening?
00:49:31.843,00:49:33.387,-Stay with her. -Yeah.
00:49:35.764,00:49:37.141,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. Where are you going?"
00:49:37.224,00:49:38.725,See if anyone else needs help. I'll be right back.
00:49:38.808,00:49:40.060,Foggy...
00:49:55.575,00:49:57.036,"Oh, my God..."
00:49:59.913,00:50:01.123,Wilson?
00:50:03.333,00:50:05.669,Did you read about the boy...
00:50:05.752,00:50:10.715,"who watched his father being pulled from their car and beaten, before the boy was taken?"
00:50:13.968,00:50:15.429,The men that did that...
00:50:16.763,00:50:19.349,they will no longer infect this city.
00:50:27.899,00:50:29.151,Good.
00:50:38.118,00:50:40.162,I need to get you home before the roads close.
00:50:40.245,00:50:41.371,Marcel?
00:50:43.915,00:50:45.417,"Your car is ready, sir."
00:50:45.500,00:50:47.169,"Yes, just one more thing..."
00:50:53.592,00:50:55.094,I want to give you this.
00:50:56.261,00:50:58.347,Thank you for everything you've done for me this evening.
00:50:59.306,00:51:01.475,"For making this call for me, especially."
00:51:01.558,00:51:03.227,"A pleasure as always, sir."
00:51:56.029,00:51:57.322,Vladimir!
00:51:59.574,00:52:00.867,Vladimir!
00:52:13.463,00:52:15.924,Paid shit for shit work.
00:52:17.259,00:52:21.721,"Although, Vlady did offer a cool mil to give up your boy."
00:52:24.974,00:52:28.395,You're alive... which means you made the right decision.
00:52:30.355,00:52:34.526,Your conversation with Vladimir caused him to react predictably.
00:52:35.444,00:52:37.153,My employer is grateful for that.
00:52:38.029,00:52:40.574,"Hey, happy to help."
00:52:42.659,00:52:44.703,But why all that with plantin' the mask?
00:52:45.745,00:52:48.957,"Why not just blow 'em up from the start, if that's what you were gonna do?"
00:52:49.040,00:52:54.170,"It takes time to arrange something like this, and help from friends."
00:52:55.672,00:52:59.343,We needed to keep Vladimir off balance until everything was in place.
00:53:01.720,00:53:02.887,Right.
00:53:03.847,00:53:06.600,Got mad respect for a smart move.
00:53:07.642,00:53:10.812,"You need anything else, you know where to find me."
00:53:10.895,00:53:11.980,Hmm.
00:53:59.110,00:54:00.779,Hands in the air!
00:54:03.782,00:54:05.199,"Hands in the air, now!"
00:00:20.270,00:00:22.480,Don't you freakin' move!
00:00:25.400,00:00:26.901,and get on your knees.
00:00:26.984,00:00:29.987,On your knees! Do it! Do it now!
00:00:30.655,00:00:33.700,Don't you move. I'll put a bullet in you!
00:00:37.662,00:00:39.122,"On your knees, do it!"
00:00:49.091,00:00:50.425,Cuff the son of a bitch.
00:00:57.682,00:00:59.892,What about this asshole?
00:00:59.976,00:01:02.354,Take care of him like we were told. No witnesses.
00:01:24.376,00:01:25.627,How bad are you hurt?
00:02:13.175,00:02:15.177,Two suspects on foot!
00:04:03.410,00:04:06.413,"-What's going on? -All right, listen up, everybody!"
00:04:06.496,00:04:10.292,We have reports coming in of multiple explosions all across Hell's Kitchen.
00:04:10.375,00:04:13.461,"-Hey, Henricks, call PD, get a statement. -Yeah."
00:04:13.545,00:04:17.757,"Taylor, reach out to your guy at public works and see if gas or methane had anything to do with this."
00:04:17.840,00:04:19.175,What are the locations?
00:04:19.259,00:04:20.552,"You see me talking here, Urich?"
00:04:20.635,00:04:23.971,"I'm just saying, it'd help if we knew where we were going to cover this."
00:04:24.055,00:04:25.932,"Caldwell, give me that list. Where are you?"
00:04:26.015,00:04:27.517,"Please. Come on, come on."
00:04:28.560,00:04:38.361,"All right, locations are as follows, 44th and 11th, 48th and 9th, 47th and 12th, 42nd and 10th."
00:04:38.445,00:04:40.988,-It's not gas. -How do you know that?
00:04:41.072,00:04:43.115,"Places that were hit, all controlled by the Russians."
00:04:43.199,00:04:45.242,Ben! Ben!
00:05:03.720,00:05:04.804,Yes.
00:05:06.055,00:05:07.515,"Yes, it is."
00:05:09.100,00:05:10.685,I'll let him know.
00:05:12.770,00:05:15.773,-Vladimir is in the wind. -How?
00:05:15.857,00:05:22.614,"Our friend in the black mask, he was beating on him, but stopped Officer Corbin and his boys from finishing him off."
00:05:22.697,00:05:24.616,Then he wasn't trying to kill Vladimir.
00:05:24.699,00:05:28.119,"Based on what we know, probably trying to get him to talk..."
00:05:30.287,00:05:32.957,"Blake was clumsy, letting the mask get his phone."
00:05:33.040,00:05:35.377,I had just texted him the addresses for the sweep.
00:05:35.460,00:05:37.670,We'll deal with Blake later.
00:05:40.131,00:05:41.799,We need to contain this.
00:05:41.883,00:05:44.844,Vladimir and the mask won't make it out of the area.
00:05:44.927,00:05:46.137,The sweep will pick them up.
00:05:46.846,00:05:49.682,Gao put her trust in me.
00:05:50.975,00:05:52.769,She gave me her help.
00:05:54.061,00:05:58.941,She's going to be disappointed the situation hasn't... concluded...
00:06:00.067,00:06:02.194,as neatly as promised.
00:06:02.278,00:06:03.488,What are you gonna tell her?
00:06:03.571,00:06:06.866,The truth. Lying to that woman is impossible.
00:06:07.534,00:06:09.243,She'll want to know what our next move is.
00:06:09.326,00:06:11.871,Letting the police do their jobs.
00:06:14.165,00:06:16.709,"That's what I pay them for, isn't it?"
00:06:22.882,00:06:24.592,"You go check on them, okay?"
00:06:44.904,00:06:47.490,"-He don't look so bad. -Yeah, all things considered."
00:06:54.664,00:06:57.750,"Swear to God, that asshole knew I was a righty."
00:07:05.091,00:07:06.425,English!
00:07:12.682,00:07:15.059,"Where would he go, huh, if he didn't want to be found?"
00:07:15.142,00:07:18.104,-He's got a girl somewhere maybe? -I don't know.
00:07:21.941,00:07:24.235,"I swear! I swear, please, please..."
00:07:24.986,00:07:26.112,Stop!
00:07:26.821,00:07:28.948,"Yeah, yeah, all right."
00:07:36.956,00:07:40.126,"You find anyone alive, shoot 'em in the head."
00:08:26.714,00:08:27.882,You've been shot.
00:08:30.552,00:08:33.387,"That sounds pretty bad, but I don't speak asshole."
00:08:33.470,00:08:37.559,I'm going to kill you for taking my brother's head.
00:08:37.642,00:08:40.352,You got the wrong guy. I don't kill people.
00:08:40.436,00:08:42.605,Not even scumbags like you who deserve it.
00:08:44.190,00:08:46.526,You dropped Semyon off roof.
00:08:47.401,00:08:48.528,Put him in coma.
00:08:48.611,00:08:51.656,"Yeah... but he was still breathing, wasn't he?"
00:08:51.739,00:08:52.907,Your mask.
00:08:54.784,00:08:58.329,I found it... and what was left of my brother.
00:08:58.412,00:08:59.956,-I didn't kill your brother. -Lie!
00:09:00.039,00:09:02.499,"You think I'm the one that blew your operation to shit, too?"
00:09:02.584,00:09:05.377,You're being played... by Fisk.
00:09:06.087,00:09:08.380,The man you work for.
00:09:08.464,00:09:10.925,"Look, I don't know what you've been told, but it's more of Fisk's games."
00:09:11.008,00:09:12.677,He's trying to put you in the ground. I'm not.
00:09:12.760,00:09:13.928,Choose a side.
00:09:15.763,00:09:17.264,I choose my own.
00:09:17.348,00:09:18.891,Not an option.
00:09:18.975,00:09:20.685,Fisk made sure of that.
00:09:22.519,00:09:23.855,What do you want?
00:09:24.480,00:09:25.648,Fisk...
00:09:26.440,00:09:28.234,on trial for everything he's done.
00:09:38.745,00:09:42.456,"And you're bleeding out, so... here we are."
00:09:43.833,00:09:45.627,And if I believe you...
00:09:47.419,00:09:50.006,and give you what you want to know...
00:09:51.382,00:09:53.593,what do I get out of it?
00:09:55.427,00:09:56.763,Payback.
00:09:57.639,00:09:59.807,I have counterproposal.
00:10:04.270,00:10:06.606,Suck my dick.
00:10:13.070,00:10:14.280,Vladimir...
00:10:15.531,00:10:26.500,"Though no one's made official statements about the nature of the explosions, the NYPD is urging everyone to stay inside until authorities are clear on the nature of-- We need help!"
00:10:26.583,00:10:28.335,Hey! Hey!
00:10:28.419,00:10:30.587,I got an elderly woman over here and she's bleeding bad!
00:10:32.214,00:10:33.215,Yeah.
00:10:34.050,00:10:35.259,Pretty bad laceration.
00:10:46.145,00:10:47.479,"We'll wait here for you, Mrs. C!"
00:10:51.233,00:10:52.735,She's gonna... She's gonna be fine.
00:10:52.819,00:10:54.946,-I'm just glad we were with her. -Yeah.
00:10:55.029,00:11:02.411,Early reports from the city-- We better call Matt and make sure he's okay.
00:11:03.579,00:11:05.164,"Foggy, you're bleeding."
00:11:05.247,00:11:06.373,Huh?
00:11:07.750,00:11:09.043,"Oh, that explains it."
00:11:09.126,00:11:11.378,-Explains what? -The stabbing pain in my side.
00:11:16.133,00:11:19.011,"Here, just stay here. I'm gonna go and try to find somebody, okay?"
00:11:23.224,00:11:27.436,"Let's get these people triaged and coded, and get Central on the line."
00:11:27.519,00:11:31.273,We need to reroute incoming casualties to Mercy or St. Mary's.
00:11:32.399,00:11:34.693,What are you doing here?
00:11:34.777,00:11:37.822,I heard you were in a car accident. And since when do you drive?
00:11:41.408,00:11:42.827,Good to have you back.
00:11:49.500,00:11:52.211,Please tell me all this isn't you dealing with the Russians.
00:11:53.545,00:11:56.548,"Wasn't me, but I don't think you have to worry about them anymore."
00:11:56.632,00:11:58.217,You call just to tell me that?
00:11:58.300,00:12:00.219,"No, I need your help."
00:12:00.302,00:12:03.389,"I found someone who has intel on what I've been looking for, but he's been shot."
00:12:03.973,00:12:05.432,So call 911.
00:12:05.516,00:12:08.477,Can't. Police are the ones that shot him.
00:12:08.560,00:12:10.855,Thinking they'd like a crack at finishing the job.
00:12:14.525,00:12:16.944,"No, I want you to walk me through stabilizing him."
00:12:19.363,00:12:21.866,"It's not as easy as it looks in the movies, you know?"
00:12:21.949,00:12:23.367,I don't really go to the movies.
00:12:24.786,00:12:26.537,"I like records, though."
00:12:28.330,00:12:30.291,There's something else you need to know.
00:12:30.374,00:12:32.919,The man I'm trying to save...
00:12:33.002,00:12:34.086,it's Vladimir.
00:12:34.170,00:12:37.006,The shithead that had me beat up?
00:12:37.089,00:12:38.465,That's who you want me to help?
00:12:38.549,00:12:41.468,"Look, you have every right to tell me to go to hell, but he's important, Claire."
00:12:41.552,00:12:44.638,What he knows could bring Fisk down and save more people like you from getting hurt.
00:12:51.353,00:12:52.563,Claire?
00:12:53.689,00:12:56.192,-Is there an exit wound? -Thank you.
00:12:57.568,00:12:58.610,"Uh, no."
00:13:00.154,00:13:01.697,The bullet's still inside him.
00:13:01.780,00:13:04.200,It's still half a degree hotter than the surrounding tissue.
00:13:04.283,00:13:06.160,Is there any kind of first aid kit?
00:13:06.243,00:13:08.454,I'm in a warehouse. Abandoned.
00:13:10.331,00:13:12.083,"Tell me what's there, anything you can use."
00:13:12.959,00:13:14.293,"All right, hang on."
00:13:17.546,00:13:21.217,"Uh, half a box of nails... broken glass..."
00:13:23.302,00:13:29.350,"uh, wood, duct tape, old roadside emergency kit, -lot of plastic sheeting-- -The kit, are there any flares in it?"
00:13:29.433,00:13:30.767,"Yeah, two."
00:13:33.687,00:13:36.899,All right... you're gonna cauterize the wound.
00:13:36.983,00:13:38.400,Shouldn't I dig the bullet out first?
00:13:38.484,00:13:40.444,Remember what I said about this not being a movie?
00:13:40.527,00:13:42.905,"You cut him open and start digging around, you'll kill him."
00:13:42.989,00:13:48.119,This way at least he has a chance of not bleeding out before you get what you need out of him and...
00:13:48.202,00:13:50.496,"it'll hurt like a son of a bitch, so bonus."
00:13:50.579,00:13:52.206,"All right, how do I do this?"
00:13:53.457,00:13:57.879,"Just light the flare, hold it close to his skin until the entry wound seals."
00:13:57.962,00:14:00.464,"Okay, I'm gonna put you on speaker."
00:14:10.724,00:14:12.143,"All right, I got it."
00:14:12.226,00:14:14.853,Don't let up... no matter how much he screams.
00:14:15.646,00:14:17.064,Professional advice or personal?
00:14:17.148,00:14:18.983,Little of both.
00:14:19.066,00:14:21.527,"All right, cauterizing the wound."
00:15:09.241,00:15:11.994,"-Thanks, Claire. I gotta go. -Matt?"
00:15:12.078,00:15:14.914,"Central, Post 41. Pick up of a 10-10."
00:15:14.997,00:15:19.043,Northwest corner of 4-7 and 12. Abandoned building. Gimme an 85.
00:16:05.422,00:16:07.133,Show me your hands!
00:16:10.136,00:16:12.096,"Show me your hands, now!"
00:16:14.265,00:16:15.891,He can't hear you.
00:16:21.188,00:16:23.232,I'm gonna take my knee off your throat.
00:16:23.315,00:16:28.654,"Stay quiet, answer my questions, or your night's gonna get a hell of a lot worse."
00:16:28.737,00:16:30.031,Understand?
00:16:36.328,00:16:37.538,Who do you work for?
00:16:38.789,00:16:40.332,The City of New York.
00:16:40.416,00:16:43.669,I'm gonna ask you again. Think about your answer.
00:16:47.339,00:16:48.507,Who do you work for?
00:16:48.590,00:16:51.677,The City of New York. I got two months on the job.
00:17:03.730,00:17:04.898,Call Central.
00:17:05.691,00:17:08.069,Tell them it was a false alarm. No need to send backup.
00:17:09.445,00:17:12.114,I do that... you let me walk?
00:17:12.864,00:17:14.241,Eventually.
00:17:22.833,00:17:24.418,"Central, Post 41 K."
00:17:28.880,00:17:37.889,"Second floor! Perp in mask! Wounded civilian-- Abandoned building, 47th and 12th, second floor."
00:18:06.543,00:18:08.712,Where's Sullivan? Anybody got eyes?
00:18:08.795,00:18:10.131,"Take it down, Pinski."
00:18:10.214,00:18:12.424,Me and Hoffman are HNT on this.
00:18:12.508,00:18:14.426,Secure the perimeter and try not to piss yourself.
00:18:14.510,00:18:17.971,We gotta do this right. This is a hostage job.
00:18:18.054,00:18:20.974,Nobody goes in and nobody comes out.
00:18:21.057,00:18:22.143,Let's go. Move.
00:18:25.604,00:18:27.773,You think he's in there?
00:18:27.856,00:18:30.276,Sullivan told Central it was a masked perp.
00:18:30.359,00:18:34.530,"Russian was with the dickhead last we heard, so yeah, I'm thinking he's the wounded civvie."
00:18:37.366,00:18:38.700,-Christ. -Where do you think you're going?
00:18:41.245,00:18:42.746,"All right, all right. Go ahead."
00:18:42.829,00:18:44.290,Detectives!
00:18:44.998,00:18:48.419,"Thought IAB'd have you riding a desk, after that thing with the Russians at the station."
00:18:48.502,00:18:51.046,You see what's going on here? Nobody's riding a desk tonight.
00:18:51.130,00:18:52.673,-Can I get a statement? -Yeah.
00:18:52.756,00:18:55.176,The world's a shitty place. You can quote me.
00:18:55.259,00:18:56.760,Where's ESU?
00:18:56.843,00:18:59.263,Had their hands full with that building that went up.
00:18:59.346,00:19:01.432,"Carl, don't talk to him. What's the matter with you?"
00:19:01.515,00:19:03.309,What about the cop in there?
00:19:03.392,00:19:06.019,"Officer, uh... Sullivan?"
00:19:06.102,00:19:07.521,How the hell you know that?
00:19:08.230,00:19:09.481,How long I been doing this?
00:19:09.565,00:19:10.941,Long enough to be a pain in the ass.
00:19:12.067,00:19:13.402,Just doing my job.
00:19:13.485,00:19:16.572,And we're doing ours... so stay back and out of the way.
00:19:16.655,00:19:20.033,"You know, this thing goes sideways, I can't promise you don't get caught up."
00:19:21.452,00:19:22.661,Thanks.
00:19:23.579,00:19:24.955,I'll keep my head down.
00:19:25.038,00:19:26.707,"Yeah, you do that."
00:19:31.002,00:19:34.047,I'll let him know. Wait for instruction.
00:19:41.012,00:19:43.682,The man in the mask has turned up.
00:19:43.765,00:19:47.769,Assaulting a cop in an abandoned building on 12th.
00:19:47.853,00:19:49.062,One of ours?
00:19:49.145,00:19:52.274,"No, some kid fresh out of the academy."
00:19:52.358,00:19:55.652,-What about Vladimir? -Holed up with the mask.
00:19:55.736,00:20:02.534,"Blake and Hoffman have assumed HNT on scene, secured the perimeter, waiting for the go-ahead to take the building."
00:20:02.618,00:20:03.869,Give it.
00:20:05.912,00:20:07.664,I wanna get this behind us.
00:20:07.748,00:20:09.833,There's a complication.
00:20:11.084,00:20:12.628,A reporter from the Bulletin.
00:20:12.711,00:20:14.170,Turn his head.
00:20:16.632,00:20:18.174,It's Ben Urich.
00:20:20.427,00:20:22.012,The Union Allied article.
00:20:22.095,00:20:25.599,If he picks up on anything doesn't smell right...
00:20:25.682,00:20:27.100,it could be a problem.
00:20:28.101,00:20:33.399,Problems are just opportunities that haven't presented themselves.
00:20:34.691,00:20:38.779,You reach out to all of our contacts in the media.
00:20:41.114,00:20:45.160,I want everyone in Hell's Kitchen to see what's about to happen.
00:21:02.511,00:21:04.430,You've been busy.
00:21:05.055,00:21:07.308,The building's surrounded.
00:21:07.391,00:21:10.686,Ten officers... four dogs.
00:21:10.769,00:21:12.479,More coming.
00:21:12.563,00:21:15.566,-How do you know this? -Lucky guess.
00:21:20.236,00:21:23.615,-We could have used that. -I'm not big on guns.
00:21:25.075,00:21:28.954,"Great. Little stick, much better."
00:21:31.540,00:21:34.376,-What did you do to me? -Road flare.
00:21:35.502,00:21:36.753,Cauterized the wound.
00:21:36.837,00:21:39.590,You... burned me?
00:21:39.673,00:21:41.550,"Yeah, I had to stop the bleeding."
00:21:47.889,00:21:51.477,"Bullet's still inside you. Wouldn't move around, if I were you."
00:21:52.644,00:21:54.730,You expect me to say thank you?
00:21:54.813,00:21:57.858,"If I didn't need you alive, we wouldn't be having this conversation."
00:22:03.489,00:22:05.741,"So you just stand there and let me die, huh?"
00:22:05.824,00:22:08.785,But you couldn't kill me yourself.
00:22:08.869,00:22:11.663,Is that where you draw the line?
00:22:17.002,00:22:19.045,Tell me what I want to know about Fisk.
00:22:19.129,00:22:21.089,You think you're different...
00:22:21.715,00:22:23.133,from me?
00:22:26.177,00:22:27.929,From him?
00:22:28.680,00:22:31.057,But you'll get there.
00:22:31.141,00:22:35.562,"Sooner or later... we all do, men like us."
00:22:35.646,00:22:38.940,A man like Fisk just took out your entire operation.
00:22:40.275,00:22:45.030,"And he may not own all the cops, but he owns enough that you won't make it into a prison cell."
00:22:45.113,00:22:48.241,"Right now, I'm your only shot at getting out of this building alive."
00:22:56.875,00:22:59.002,His lapdog came to us first.
00:23:01.379,00:23:04.340,He told us his employer had taken note.
00:23:04.425,00:23:06.510,He complimented...
00:23:06.593,00:23:08.303,us on our business.
00:23:09.971,00:23:13.767,Invited us to be part of something bigger...
00:23:15.686,00:23:17.103,to expand...
00:23:18.605,00:23:20.857,if we entered into an agreement.
00:23:20.941,00:23:22.358,What did Fisk offer?
00:23:22.443,00:23:24.653,Police looking other way...
00:23:26.029,00:23:27.948,aid from politicians...
00:23:30.826,00:23:34.455,and access to Chinese and their heroin.
00:23:34.538,00:23:37.958,"-He's working with the Chinese? -You really don't know anything, do you?"
00:23:39.000,00:23:43.213,Just snapping at scraps falling from table.
00:23:43.296,00:23:44.380,I want names.
00:23:44.465,00:23:46.758,Everything you know about them and how they connect to Fisk.
00:23:47.509,00:23:49.761,There's only one name that matters.
00:23:51.555,00:23:54.432,The man that can tie it all together.
00:23:54.516,00:23:55.684,Who?
00:23:58.311,00:24:00.897,Have you heard of the name...
00:24:02.899,00:24:04.776,Leslie Shumway?
00:24:04.860,00:24:06.487,"No, he work for Fisk?"
00:24:11.992,00:24:13.494,almost as bad as Russian.
00:24:13.577,00:24:15.036,Come on.
00:24:15.120,00:24:19.082,Leslie Shumway was an accountant...
00:24:20.458,00:24:23.169,to your... Al Capone.
00:24:23.253,00:24:25.463,"Okay, you know who Fisk's money man is."
00:24:25.547,00:24:28.424,Not just Fisk. He handled it...
00:24:31.427,00:24:32.596,for all of us.
00:24:32.679,00:24:34.765,Who is he? Where do I find him?
00:24:35.473,00:24:37.601,We were going to rule this city...
00:24:38.935,00:24:40.145,my brother and I.
00:24:40.228,00:24:42.022,"Vladimir, the name!"
00:24:42.939,00:24:44.399,His name...
00:24:45.316,00:24:47.027,His name...
00:24:51.322,00:24:53.158,His name is...
00:25:40.997,00:25:44.876,"You see that, old timer? That's you not mattering anymore."
00:25:45.877,00:25:48.672,Television's been around a while. Maybe you've heard.
00:25:48.755,00:25:51.257,"-Ah, funny guy. -Yeah, a real crack-up."
00:25:52.383,00:25:55.553,"How's it feel, Urich, knowing that your day's passed?"
00:25:55.637,00:25:59.307,"You're like the freaking dinosaurs, watching that big rock crashing into 'em."
00:25:59.891,00:26:01.727,I still got a few good stories in me.
00:26:09.943,00:26:17.909,"Kyle, authorities have cornered the suspects in the bombings that occurred earlier this evening in Hell's Kitchen, believing they may have taken a police officer hostage."
00:26:17.993,00:26:21.371,While they haven't released the name of the police officer in question...
00:26:21.454,00:26:24.875,"Matt, it's Karen, again. Uh, where are you?"
00:26:25.792,00:26:29.254,Would you just please give us a call when you get this?
00:26:30.380,00:26:32.590,He's still not answering.
00:26:32.674,00:26:35.343,-Did you try his apartment? -Three times.
00:26:35.426,00:26:38.346,"All right, let's not jump to things people jump to."
00:26:38.429,00:26:39.890,"Well, he's a blind guy in a war zone."
00:26:39.973,00:26:41.557,Seems like jumping's a pretty reasonable option.
00:26:43.685,00:26:46.187,"Sometimes I even forget he can't see, the way he zips around."
00:26:48.189,00:26:49.482,So you're not worried?
00:26:52.694,00:26:54.070,I'm gonna go look for him.
00:26:54.154,00:26:57.032,"Whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no. The hell you are."
00:26:57.115,00:26:58.199,Lay back.
00:26:59.743,00:27:02.788,I'm the closest he has to family. He'd do the same for me.
00:27:02.871,00:27:07.292,"I know... and I love that about you guys, but don't be an idiot."
00:27:08.126,00:27:09.335,Wouldn't be the first time.
00:27:12.547,00:27:15.341,You've played the hero enough for one day.
00:27:16.092,00:27:18.094,"You're here, and safe."
00:27:19.012,00:27:20.806,"So let's keep it that way, okay?"
00:27:29.731,00:27:32.650,I am gonna go check downstairs...
00:27:33.819,00:27:36.196,make sure Matt hasn't been brought in.
00:27:41.451,00:27:43.036,"Hell of a first date, huh?"
00:27:45.621,00:27:46.790,"I've, uh..."
00:28:07.894,00:28:10.313,Matt? It's Foggy.
00:28:11.481,00:28:13.649,"Where are you, buddy?"
00:28:55.066,00:28:56.609,That wasn't very smart.
00:28:57.693,00:28:59.320,But it was fun...
00:29:01.072,00:29:02.908,watching you bleed.
00:29:03.992,00:29:06.077,You think this is a game?
00:29:11.332,00:29:13.043,you'd be losing.
00:29:39.360,00:29:40.528,No...
00:29:42.613,00:29:43.739,No...
00:29:48.995,00:29:50.038,Come on.
00:29:52.999,00:29:56.211,I'm not done with you yet. You hear me?
00:29:56.294,00:29:58.338,I'm not done with you yet.
00:30:08.348,00:30:09.599,What...
00:30:16.689,00:30:18.524,What...
00:30:19.234,00:30:20.693,You died.
00:30:29.828,00:30:33.539,You can't even stand there and let me die.
00:30:37.085,00:30:38.128,No.
00:30:40.630,00:30:43.008,Not until you give me what I need on Fisk.
00:30:58.231,00:31:01.276,Emergency Service Unit is en route.
00:31:01.359,00:31:04.154,Blake and Hoffman are clearing a channel.
00:31:27.928,00:31:30.055,"Tell those guys, they shoot anyone who moves."
00:31:30.138,00:31:31.764,We got ESU on the scene.
00:31:31.847,00:31:35.894,Everybody switch your radios to channel five and maintain radio discipline.
00:31:37.603,00:31:39.439,Maybe you finally get a story worth printing.
00:31:39.522,00:31:40.606,"Let's go, fellas."
00:32:16.601,00:32:18.186,What are you doing?
00:32:19.770,00:32:21.897,Finding us a way out.
00:32:55.223,00:32:56.391,Hello.
00:33:15.994,00:33:19.205,Are you there? Can you hear me?
00:33:26.796,00:33:29.924,-Who is this? -I think you know.
00:33:30.925,00:33:35.013,You've been asking about me. I thought it was time we spoke.
00:33:38.766,00:33:41.977,-Say your name. -You first.
00:33:45.648,00:33:47.608,That's what I thought.
00:33:50.861,00:33:52.738,You and I have a lot in common.
00:33:53.614,00:33:55.116,We're nothing alike.
00:33:55.200,00:33:57.952,That's what you'll tell yourself.
00:33:58.036,00:34:01.997,You're feeding off this city... like a cancer.
00:34:02.082,00:34:04.709,"I want to save this city, like you..."
00:34:06.586,00:34:08.171,only on a scale that matters.
00:34:08.254,00:34:10.298,Now tell that to the people you've hurt.
00:34:10.381,00:34:11.799,Young man...
00:34:12.717,00:34:14.302,life is not a fairy tale.
00:34:14.385,00:34:19.307,Not everyone deserves... a happy ending.
00:34:20.641,00:34:22.393,I'm gonna find you...
00:34:23.853,00:34:25.771,and I'm gonna make you pay for what you've done.
00:34:25.855,00:34:27.398,"No, you are not."
00:34:27.482,00:34:30.568,Not that I don't admire what you're trying to do...
00:34:31.569,00:34:33.404,to change the world...
00:34:36.366,00:34:39.452,with nothing but desire and your own two hands...
00:34:40.745,00:34:45.666,"secure in the knowledge that you're doing the right thing, the only thing."
00:34:47.668,00:34:49.962,That's something that I do understand.
00:34:50.921,00:34:53.466,But we both can't have what we want.
00:34:54.842,00:34:56.051,So...
00:34:57.637,00:34:59.472,your part...
00:35:00.431,00:35:04.560,"in this drama, by necessity, comes to an end."
00:35:07.313,00:35:10.900,It's gonna take a lot more than a voice on a radio to stop me.
00:35:12.985,00:35:15.696,It's the city you just blew the hell out of.
00:35:21.161,00:35:22.662,You...
00:35:22.745,00:35:24.789,You think anyone's gonna believe that?
00:35:24.872,00:35:32.338,"You're running around in a mask, holing up with a known felon in the wake of a series of bombings."
00:35:32.422,00:35:35.841,"There's that police officer you're holding hostage, so..."
00:35:35.925,00:35:37.177,yes.
00:35:38.093,00:35:39.762,"Actually, I do."
00:35:40.596,00:35:42.848,But it doesn't have to be this way.
00:35:42.932,00:35:44.600,The Russian...
00:35:44.684,00:35:46.060,is he alive?
00:35:46.144,00:35:48.604,"I'm still here, you fat shit!"
00:35:49.272,00:35:50.898,Does that answer your question?
00:35:52.107,00:35:53.943,It's a one-time offer.
00:35:57.112,00:36:02.327,"You kill the Russian, and we'll call the night a push."
00:36:03.661,00:36:05.413,You know what he's done...
00:36:06.956,00:36:08.249,to women...
00:36:10.710,00:36:14.255,to the people of this city that you claim to care about.
00:36:15.590,00:36:18.133,But do you know how much he enjoyed it?
00:36:18.218,00:36:20.886,You just confirmed how important he is.
00:36:22.305,00:36:24.432,"That must worry you, what he might tell me."
00:36:24.515,00:36:26.809,Which means he hasn't told you anything yet.
00:36:30.145,00:36:33.023,You're a child playing at being a hero.
00:36:33.107,00:36:35.193,"No, no, I'm not trying to be a hero."
00:36:35.276,00:36:39.322,I'm just a guy that got fed up with men like you and I decided to do something about it.
00:36:39.405,00:36:41.949,That's what makes you dangerous.
00:36:42.032,00:36:43.368,It's not the mask.
00:36:43.451,00:36:45.245,It's not the skills.
00:36:46.704,00:36:48.581,It's your ideology.
00:36:50.375,00:36:51.917,The lone man...
00:36:53.753,00:36:55.796,who thinks he can make a difference.
00:36:58.883,00:37:00.050,I...
00:37:00.801,00:37:04.054,I respect your conviction...
00:37:04.138,00:37:07.308,even if it runs counter with... with my own.
00:37:07.392,00:37:09.602,"Yeah, keep telling yourself you've won."
00:37:09.685,00:37:12.605,It'll make what I'm gonna do to you so much more satisfying.
00:37:13.439,00:37:15.149,Your part ends tonight.
00:37:15.233,00:37:18.027,"And if that's true, others will take my place."
00:37:18.110,00:37:21.822,"They'll see what I was trying to do and they'll make sure-- No, they won't."
00:37:23.616,00:37:26.076,The city will burn you in effigy.
00:37:26.160,00:37:28.954,"Your name, your very existence..."
00:37:30.331,00:37:35.002,will be met with abhorrence and disgust.
00:37:38.130,00:37:39.507,Do it.
00:37:47.598,00:37:50.935,You guys don't seem to be doing much hostage negotiating.
00:37:52.186,00:37:53.479,"How many times, Urich?"
00:37:54.188,00:37:55.898,"I told you, back off!"
00:37:55.981,00:37:57.358,"You know, this is bullshit and you know it."
00:37:59.527,00:38:01.362,"Huh, Detective? You gonna start being straight with me?"
00:38:08.994,00:38:10.455,Shit!
00:38:12.540,00:38:13.833,Shit!
00:38:18.629,00:38:20.840,Get an EMT! Go! Go!
00:38:20.923,00:38:22.049,Go!
00:38:35.563,00:38:37.398,Goodbye.
00:38:37.482,00:38:40.025,I'm afraid we won't speak again.
00:38:40.735,00:38:41.861,Fisk...
00:38:43.863,00:38:44.905,Fisk!
00:38:45.823,00:38:47.157,"Fisk, answer me!"
00:38:50.911,00:38:52.747,Tell our friends to roll the tape.
00:39:00.838,00:39:07.052,A deadly shooting just moments ago as three of New York's finest have been gunned down in Hell's Kitchen.
00:39:07.136,00:39:09.930,We still have little information as to who.
00:39:10.931,00:39:16.186,We are just getting word of a fast development in the investigation into the Hell's Kitchen explosions.
00:39:19.064,00:39:20.274,Hmm?
00:39:20.358,00:39:22.568,Turn it up. I want to hear this.
00:39:23.569,00:39:26.489,The authorities have just released some video.
00:39:26.572,00:39:34.038,"This is taken just moments after the explosions that stunned Hell's Kitchen earlier tonight, pulled from a security camera."
00:39:34.121,00:39:42.212,"And authorities believe this man is responsible for the bombings, possibly as part of an ongoing feud with the Russian mob."
00:39:42.296,00:39:43.756,"Oh, my God."
00:39:43.839,00:39:44.965,That's him.
00:39:45.049,00:39:53.057,The same man suspected of having just shot and killed the three police officers -at the scene of a standoff... -That's the guy who saved my life.
00:39:53.641,00:39:55.225,This guy?
00:39:55.309,00:39:56.602,Jesus...
00:39:56.686,00:39:57.812,You're lucky he didn't kill you.
00:39:57.895,00:39:59.772,I don't understand why he would do something like this.
00:40:02.232,00:40:04.151,"I don't know, he just didn't..."
00:40:04.234,00:40:05.861,General rule...
00:40:05.945,00:40:08.781,"guys who wear masks have something to hide, and it usually ain't good."
00:40:08.864,00:40:12.952,"...battleground of Hell's Kitchen, one has to wonder whose side is this man on?"
00:40:31.053,00:40:32.262,It's really not a good time.
00:40:32.346,00:40:35.683,On the news... they're saying that you shot those cops.
00:40:35.766,00:40:36.809,No.
00:40:38.060,00:40:39.228,It was Fisk.
00:40:40.480,00:40:41.606,It's all Fisk.
00:41:05.295,00:41:06.464,Um...
00:41:06.547,00:41:09.925,"-What you said, before I left... -I was..."
00:41:10.009,00:41:14.597,"I'm sorry, I just-- No, don't be. It turns out you were..."
00:41:14.680,00:41:16.140,You were right...
00:41:17.141,00:41:18.433,about me.
00:41:20.185,00:41:22.605,I just don't want you getting caught up if it goes that way.
00:41:23.564,00:41:25.983,If we don't get a chance to talk again...
00:41:27.109,00:41:29.153,you take care of yourself.
00:41:31.113,00:41:32.239,Matt?
00:41:33.741,00:41:34.867,"Matt, wait!"
00:42:04.479,00:42:06.440,This is not how I die.
00:42:27.753,00:42:29.213,Officer Sullivan is dead.
00:42:51.360,00:42:52.527,This way.
00:43:03.122,00:43:04.289,Where are we?
00:43:05.625,00:43:07.209,Access tunnels.
00:43:07.292,00:43:10.129,"The city was built on a network of these, most of them sealed up years ago."
00:43:12.547,00:43:15.175,"All right, we have to keep moving, find a way to the street."
00:44:04.141,00:44:05.517,Let's go.
00:44:11.691,00:44:13.442,There are five more coming.
00:44:13.525,00:44:16.153,"All working for Fisk, probably not even real cops."
00:44:16.987,00:44:18.363,We don't have time for this.
00:44:19.573,00:44:20.825,I think...
00:44:22.284,00:44:23.661,maybe I stay.
00:44:25.579,00:44:27.414,We can still make it out of here.
00:44:29.083,00:44:32.252,"-You turn evidence on Fisk, we can-- -He controls..."
00:44:32.336,00:44:34.379,all police...
00:44:34.463,00:44:35.840,judges.
00:44:40.510,00:44:41.553,No.
00:44:43.013,00:44:44.264,I'm not a killer.
00:44:44.348,00:44:46.391,The moment you put on the mask...
00:44:47.309,00:44:49.937,you got into cage with animals.
00:44:51.021,00:44:53.357,Animals don't stop fighting.
00:44:54.483,00:44:56.736,Not until one of them is dead.
00:45:09.623,00:45:11.458,What Fisk did to me...
00:45:13.085,00:45:14.754,he'll do to you.
00:45:17.297,00:45:19.466,And he will do it...
00:45:19.549,00:45:21.718,to everyone you care about.
00:45:26.431,00:45:28.308,Or will you be man...
00:45:30.519,00:45:33.022,and do what you know you must do?
00:45:34.689,00:45:38.068,"The dermo who controls money, his name is..."
00:45:38.693,00:45:40.863,Leland Owlsley.
00:45:42.907,00:45:45.700,He will give you what you think you want.
00:45:49.997,00:45:51.999,But it won't be enough.
00:45:54.376,00:45:56.336,"You know that now, don't you?"
00:46:01.591,00:46:02.759,Go.
00:01:24.417,00:01:26.211,Where is it?
00:01:26.794,00:01:27.837,I don't know.
00:01:27.920,00:01:30.590,Where is the Black Sky?
00:01:36.554,00:01:40.642,You have three limbs left.
00:01:40.725,00:01:43.520,And other appendages no man wants to lose.
00:01:44.604,00:01:47.440,Where is the Black Sky?
00:01:47.524,00:01:49.025,It's gone.
00:01:50.235,00:01:52.279,They...
00:01:52.362,00:01:54.114,They put it on a ship.
00:01:57.033,00:01:58.868,New York City.
00:02:00.453,00:02:01.621,Swear to it.
00:02:01.704,00:02:03.665,Upon my family.
00:02:07.835,00:02:12.757,They're better off without you.
00:07:29.949,00:07:31.451,"Owlsley, Leland: Financial Advisor..."
00:07:31.534,00:07:33.786,at the prestigious firm of Silver &amp; Brent...
00:30:39.004,00:30:41.840,How's your head?
00:30:41.923,00:30:43.258,I'm alive.
00:30:43.341,00:30:45.218,It's enough.
00:30:46.344,00:30:48.554,How much do I owe you for the groceries?
00:30:52.183,00:30:53.935,I don't want your money.
00:30:54.019,00:30:56.354,"No, I don't take charity."
00:30:56.437,00:30:58.189,All right.
00:30:58.273,00:31:00.859,You can pay me if you want...
00:31:00.942,00:31:02.277,with information?
00:31:02.818,00:31:04.570,What can I tell you?
00:31:04.654,00:31:07.490,"A lot, I hope."
00:31:09.325,00:31:13.246,I'm working on a legal case...
00:31:13.329,00:31:15.248,"Oh, yes, yes..."
00:31:15.331,00:31:17.458,with the handsome lawyer.
00:31:21.254,00:31:23.882,"No, Mr. Foggy."
00:31:25.175,00:31:27.093,You think Foggy is handsome?
00:31:28.303,00:31:31.056,I see the way he looks at you.
00:31:31.139,00:31:36.352,Never is a man more good looking than when he is in love.
00:31:42.858,00:31:43.859,I'm sorry.
00:31:49.908,00:31:55.455,I'm trying to make a connection...
00:31:56.372,00:32:05.006,between a construction company and the repairman that did this to your apartment.
00:32:05.090,00:32:08.718,Why don't you ask Mr. Tully?
00:32:08.801,00:32:10.720,He sent them.
00:32:10.803,00:32:13.473,I can't find him.
00:32:13.556,00:32:18.144,His lawyers say he's on vacation.
00:32:19.354,00:32:26.069,I live like this and that fat shit is lying on a beach?
00:32:28.363,00:32:29.364,Excuse me.
00:32:30.823,00:32:32.492,I think...
00:32:32.575,00:32:34.869,it's pretty damn appropriate in this case.
00:32:37.038,00:32:41.167,Do you have papers from the repairs?
00:32:41.251,00:32:44.004,Receipts? Anything you had to-- Sign?
00:32:44.087,00:32:45.463,"No, I'm sorry."
00:32:45.546,00:32:49.092,"I just called Mr. Tully, and he sent them over."
00:32:49.175,00:32:50.885,Can you tell me what they looked like?
00:32:50.969,00:32:52.428,Yes.
00:32:52.512,00:32:54.722,One was bald.
00:32:54.805,00:32:59.644,And the other had a big tattoo on his arm.
00:33:01.854,00:33:02.855,Of what?
00:33:04.274,00:33:05.858,Not a picture.
00:33:06.859,00:33:08.528,It was like a...
00:33:08.611,00:33:10.196,pattern.
00:33:10.280,00:33:12.991,Ugly. Went up to his neck.
00:33:13.074,00:33:15.493,Thank God he's no son of mine.
00:33:17.245,00:33:18.954,"Thank you, Elena."
00:33:19.039,00:33:21.166,That might help.
00:33:23.418,00:33:26.796,All of this makes me worry.
00:33:30.675,00:33:32.010,They...
00:33:32.093,00:33:34.804,They're the ones that should be worried.
00:33:36.014,00:33:37.932,If I can find a connection...
00:33:38.016,00:33:41.436,to the men that did this and the company...
00:33:45.940,00:33:49.152,"How long have you been like this, Miss Page?"
00:33:51.987,00:33:53.489,Ever since...
00:33:54.782,00:33:56.659,I got to New York.
00:38:37.064,00:38:38.358,Kill him!
00:38:44.447,00:38:45.698,Go!
00:03:30.960,00:03:33.588,"Devil, my shapely Irish ass."
00:03:35.465,00:03:36.883,Guy's a coward.
00:03:36.966,00:03:40.428,Would and I wouldn't give for the chance to rip that corny mask off and...
00:03:41.679,00:03:42.930,And what?
00:03:43.014,00:03:45.099,Punch him... in the face...
00:03:45.182,00:03:48.019,with my... fisticuffs.
00:03:49.771,00:03:53.107,"I don't know, he seems, uh... pretty fisticuffy."
00:03:53.190,00:03:56.319,Please tell me I don't detect a hint of admiration for that terrorist.
00:04:00.532,00:04:02.534,You're absolutely right. Terrorists have causes.
00:04:02.617,00:04:04.244,They claim responsibility.
00:04:04.327,00:04:08.205,Al-Qaeda wanted the world to know exactly what kind of assholes they were.
00:04:08.290,00:04:10.542,This guy? Not a peep.
00:04:10.625,00:04:12.043,All terror without the -ist.
00:04:12.126,00:04:14.086,You know what they call that? Nut job.
00:04:19.967,00:04:22.178,"All right, what do you think, Matt?"
00:04:22.262,00:04:25.807,I think Foggy'll be pitching for the Mets by mid-season.
00:04:29.436,00:04:34.106,"Come on, you telling me this dickhead blowing up our backyard doesn't piss you off?"
00:04:39.195,00:04:40.738,"yeah, it pisses me off."
00:04:40.822,00:04:44.784,"But this man, whoever he is, whatever his motive, he shouldn't be tried and convicted in the press."
00:04:44.867,00:04:47.620,"We're lawyers, we know that's not how it's supposed to work."
00:04:47.704,00:04:51.040,"So, uh, hypothetically, if this guy got caught..."
00:04:51.123,00:04:53.751,"needed counsel, Nelson and Murdock would offer to defend him?"
00:04:54.961,00:04:56.421,It would be his right.
00:04:57.254,00:04:59.131,What about my right to punch him in the melon?
00:04:59.215,00:05:01.343,They pulled a piece of glass out of my side.
00:05:03.511,00:05:05.763,And you want to Perry Mason the guy responsible?
00:05:05.847,00:05:08.265,I wanna make sure the right person pays for what happened.
00:05:08.350,00:05:09.934,The whole thing's moot.
00:05:10.017,00:05:15.147,"After shooting those cops, police are probably looking to settle things the old-fashioned way if they catch up to him."
00:05:15.231,00:05:18.275,"Yeah, it's more than likely."
00:05:18.360,00:05:22.822,"Just a thought, but we may wanna go a bit peppier at the end of the day."
00:05:22.905,00:05:26.117,Leave on a note slightly higher than deeply depressing.
00:05:36.168,00:05:37.920,When are we getting a company team together?
00:05:38.004,00:05:40.047,We have three employees.
00:05:40.965,00:05:43.217,At least two of them aren't blind.
00:05:43.300,00:05:45.387,"Naysayers, each and every one of you."
00:05:45.470,00:05:46.721,"Karen, come on."
00:05:46.804,00:05:48.598,"Batting practice, you and me, Chelsea Piers."
00:05:48.681,00:05:50.808,"-What do you say? -Um, I..."
00:05:50.892,00:05:53.144,Or not. Totally cool.
00:05:55.271,00:05:56.898,"I have this, uh, thing."
00:06:00.485,00:06:01.611,Not a problem.
00:06:01.694,00:06:04.822,"Okay, so, um... see you tomorrow."
00:06:04.906,00:06:08.367,"We'll be here, ready to high note and stuff."
00:06:08.451,00:06:09.452,Good.
00:06:14.499,00:06:15.625,Smooth.
00:06:15.708,00:06:18.252,"Admittedly, I'm a work in progress."
00:06:19.671,00:06:21.631,Did you know she has mace on her keychain?
00:06:21.714,00:06:22.924,Is that a bad thing?
00:06:23.007,00:06:24.884,You ever worry about her?
00:06:24.967,00:06:28.220,"Worry, like, something she's not telling us?"
00:06:28.304,00:06:30.306,"Everyone has secrets, Foggy."
00:06:30.389,00:06:32.975,I don't. I'd like some.
00:06:33.059,00:06:36.979,Your kind... like with Hottie McBurner-Phone.
00:06:37.063,00:06:39.524,"I mean, I assume she's hot. Is she hot?"
00:06:39.607,00:06:41.025,Oh...
00:06:41.108,00:06:42.777,How would I know?
00:06:42.860,00:06:44.571,This again.
00:06:44.654,00:06:46.280,You always know.
00:06:46.363,00:06:47.740,"I mean, you guys getting serious?"
00:06:47.824,00:06:49.951,Should I dust off the tux I'll need to rent?
00:06:52.036,00:06:55.457,"No, uh... it didn't work out."
00:06:55.540,00:06:56.541,Oh.
00:06:56.624,00:06:59.210,"I'm... I'm sorry, man."
00:06:59.293,00:07:00.753,"Yeah, me too."
00:07:02.213,00:07:05.508,"Hey, look, I'm gonna order in tonight, get a jump on this tenement case."
00:07:05.592,00:07:07.009,You want me to stay?
00:07:07.093,00:07:09.011,"No, I'll be all right. Thanks, buddy."
00:07:09.095,00:07:10.847,See you in the morning.
00:07:17.269,00:07:19.230,"Hey, Matt..."
00:07:19.313,00:07:21.691,"her loss, man. Seriously."
00:07:43.129,00:07:46.048,The funds have been reallocated as requested.
00:07:46.132,00:07:50.887,All the arrangements made per your agreement with the guy we're not supposed to blah blah blah.
00:07:50.970,00:07:52.639,Business may continue?
00:07:52.722,00:07:56.893,In the best possible way... uninterrupted.
00:07:56.976,00:08:00.354,"So, uh, what are you going to do with it when it arrives?"
00:08:01.898,00:08:10.782,"What, you think I'm a doddering pencil pusher who moves enormous amounts of money with no clue as to what it's connected to?"
00:08:12.659,00:08:14.536,The numbers are like tea leaves.
00:08:14.619,00:08:16.829,Nobody reads them like I can.
00:08:18.289,00:08:22.251,You're laying out major reserves to clear the docks...
00:08:26.589,00:08:31.928,More to bribe the comptrollers to guarantee straight greens.
00:08:33.888,00:08:35.723,Know how much all that costs?
00:08:35.807,00:08:36.849,I do.
00:08:40.520,00:08:49.111,"Yeah, I got a-- What happened to the Russians..."
00:08:49.195,00:08:52.156,"We need to be careful, all of us."
00:08:52.239,00:08:56.202,I look out for you... you look out for me.
00:08:56.285,00:08:57.537,All I'm saying.
00:09:00.414,00:09:04.001,Each man must stand... for himself...
00:09:04.085,00:09:06.629,or fall with the unworthy.
00:09:07.630,00:09:09.591,What the hell does that mean?
00:09:18.933,00:09:20.101,Prick.
00:09:27.024,00:09:28.317,"Oh, God!"
00:09:28.400,00:09:30.527,What do you want? My wallet?
00:09:30.612,00:09:33.781,You know what I want. Tell me about the man you work for.
00:09:38.745,00:09:40.622,I'm gonna ask you again.
00:09:41.748,00:09:44.083,Think about your answer.
00:09:46.252,00:09:47.670,Who do you work for?
00:09:47.754,00:09:55.637,"I told you, I work for Silver and-- You work for Wilson Fisk..."
00:09:55.720,00:09:58.430,moving his money around.
00:09:58.514,00:10:37.428,"Which means you have records, proof of who-- You just gonna lie there all night?"
00:10:50.733,00:10:51.984,He's getting worse.
00:10:52.068,00:10:57.031,"When we first took him in, Matthew's problems seemed less severe."
00:10:57.114,00:10:59.450,Now he's in so much pain.
00:10:59.533,00:11:05.122,"Doctors, clergy, no one has any idea what's wrong with him."
00:11:05.206,00:11:10.377,We heard about your work with special children and thought maybe you could help.
00:11:10.461,00:11:11.921,Not for free.
00:11:13.005,00:11:15.883,His father left a sizeable inheritance.
00:11:15.967,00:11:18.177,What about the mother? Is she dead?
00:11:18.260,00:11:23.265,"No, she's-- Well, that's another story. Here we are."
00:11:26.435,00:11:29.939,Make the check out to cash. I'll take it from here.
00:11:39.907,00:11:42.201,They think you're getting worse.
00:11:43.202,00:11:46.538,"But... you're not, are you, kid?"
00:11:51.710,00:11:53.712,You're getting stronger.
00:12:02.471,00:12:04.348,You like ice cream?
00:12:04.431,00:12:06.058,Yeah.
00:12:06.142,00:12:09.979,Then shut up and eat it. I'll ask the questions.
00:12:11.480,00:12:17.611,First thing you gotta understand is nobody feels sorry for you and nobody ever will.
00:12:18.529,00:12:21.783,'Cause when it comes to being born lucky...
00:12:21.866,00:12:23.868,you won the friggin' lottery.
00:12:23.951,00:12:25.036,I did?
00:12:25.995,00:12:28.205,What did I say about questions?
00:12:28.289,00:12:29.456,Shut up.
00:12:30.291,00:12:31.542,Good.
00:12:32.584,00:12:35.712,How old were you when you got blinded?
00:12:35.797,00:12:37.673,-Nine. -Nine?
00:12:38.674,00:12:46.473,"So you had nine whole years of looking at movies, blue skies, up girlies' skirts that I never had."
00:12:46.557,00:12:49.185,I was born blind.
00:12:49.268,00:12:51.645,"You don't hear me whining about it, do you?"
00:12:51.728,00:12:52.771,No.
00:12:52.855,00:13:00.529,"So, you're nine years old, walking along, minding your own business and whammo!"
00:13:00.612,00:13:04.116,"Get hit by a truck, killed dead on the spot."
00:13:04.200,00:13:05.617,I wasn't killed.
00:13:05.701,00:13:07.036,You lived?
00:13:07.119,00:13:08.787,"Praise God, it's a miracle."
00:13:08.871,00:13:15.294,So you survive the truck and get this chemical shit in your eyes.
00:13:16.503,00:13:18.255,I hear things.
00:13:18.339,00:13:19.966,What kind of things?
00:13:20.049,00:13:21.092,Everything.
00:13:21.175,00:13:24.720,Coughs and fights and cats meowing.
00:13:24.803,00:13:26.638,Sometimes blocks away.
00:13:26.722,00:13:27.764,I can sense things.
00:13:27.849,00:13:30.309,I know where things are and when they move.
00:13:31.768,00:13:32.811,But I can't see.
00:13:32.895,00:13:36.065,You know what they call stuff like that?
00:13:36.148,00:13:37.274,Gifts.
00:13:37.358,00:13:39.986,The special kind.
00:13:40.069,00:13:43.072,The kind that very few people have.
00:13:43.990,00:13:45.324,Or deserve.
00:13:45.407,00:13:47.034,I never thought of it that way.
00:13:49.161,00:13:50.704,"I'm not stupid, I'm smart."
00:13:50.787,00:13:56.085,Because you taught yourself how to run your little fingers over the bumps and read Braille?
00:13:56.168,00:13:58.754,"Smart don't come out of books, kid."
00:13:58.837,00:14:03.717,Smart is making the right decision at the right time.
00:14:05.011,00:14:06.929,Like now.
00:14:07.013,00:14:09.056,"What's it gonna be, Matty?"
00:14:09.140,00:14:13.644,You gonna spend your life crying and rocking yourself to sleep at night?
00:14:13.727,00:14:21.402,Or are you gonna dig deep and find out what it takes to reshuffle those cards life dealt you?
00:14:22.819,00:14:24.155,Your call.
00:14:33.539,00:14:36.042,No one's bought me ice cream since my dad died.
00:14:36.125,00:14:37.668,What's it taste like?
00:14:39.795,00:14:42.589,Everybody can taste vanilla.
00:14:42.673,00:14:46.468,"Pay a little more attention, use those gifts."
00:14:46.552,00:14:48.387,You know what you got?
00:14:49.471,00:14:57.063,"Sugar grains, vanilla bean, milk from three different dairies from two states..."
00:15:00.191,00:15:01.775,ugh...
00:15:01.858,00:15:05.571,batch of chemicals straight off the periodic tables and...
00:15:07.864,00:15:10.576,dirt off the guy's hand that served it to you.
00:15:11.743,00:15:14.705,He spent his morning gardening.
00:15:14.788,00:15:18.792,"Whole world around you, Matty, and it is friggin' huge."
00:15:18.875,00:15:20.586,And all you need...
00:15:21.878,00:15:23.714,are the guts to let it in.
00:15:23.797,00:15:25.341,Try.
00:15:25.424,00:15:28.760,"That dog, what's his story?"
00:15:30.554,00:15:32.014,He's hungry...
00:15:32.098,00:15:33.557,his stomach's growling...
00:15:34.475,00:15:38.437,and he's dying to eat the hot dogs that guy's carrying just upwind of him.
00:15:40.314,00:15:41.898,Not bad.
00:15:41.983,00:15:44.276,What about the girl?
00:15:53.452,00:15:54.745,Is she sick?
00:15:54.828,00:15:56.538,Worse.
00:15:56.622,00:15:57.999,She's in love.
00:15:58.082,00:15:59.583,And the old man?
00:16:04.546,00:16:05.797,He's...
00:16:08.259,00:16:09.468,He's dying.
00:16:13.889,00:16:18.477,Big world... not all of it flowers and sunshine.
00:16:19.353,00:16:28.612,And the only way guys like you and me can survive is to grab it by the throat and never let go.
00:16:32.824,00:16:34.368,Depends on the question.
00:16:37.621,00:16:41.167,Old bitty at the orphanage thinks it's her idea.
00:16:41.250,00:16:43.085,"But it wasn't, was it?"
00:16:44.920,00:16:47.048,Maybe it's one of my gifts.
00:16:47.131,00:16:49.466,Or you just got lucky.
00:16:53.804,00:16:55.847,You catch on quick.
00:16:58.267,00:16:59.518,You're going to help me?
00:17:00.102,00:17:02.063,"No, I'm gonna train you."
00:17:03.314,00:17:07.151,"How to control your gift, make it work for you..."
00:17:07.234,00:17:10.571,"use it, and how to fight."
00:17:10.654,00:17:12.573,My dad never wanted me to fight.
00:17:12.656,00:17:15.826,Your dad ain't here. You'll need skills for the war.
00:17:15.909,00:17:17.244,What war?
00:17:22.041,00:17:24.251,I don't even know your name. What do I call you?
00:17:24.335,00:17:25.836,Stick.
00:17:25.919,00:17:29.506,Are you gonna lie there all night or get up off your ass?
00:17:30.424,00:17:31.592,"Jesus, kid."
00:17:31.675,00:17:34.928,"I'm gone five minutes, you turn this place into a shit show."
00:17:38.932,00:17:40.934,Your city?
00:17:41.017,00:17:43.270,Hell's Kitchen hates your guts.
00:17:43.354,00:17:47.191,They have you pegged as a cop killer and some kind of mad bomber.
00:17:47.274,00:17:48.525,"Yeah, I'm taking care of it."
00:17:48.609,00:17:50.361,An old guy just lit you up.
00:17:50.444,00:17:52.196,You ain't taking care of shit.
00:17:52.279,00:17:53.947,Why are you here?
00:17:54.030,00:17:55.949,To save you...
00:17:56.032,00:17:59.328,and everyone in the Kitchen from a horrible death.
00:18:01.122,00:18:02.498,More or less.
00:18:05.751,00:18:08.462,Paper trail on Union Allied's a bust.
00:18:08.545,00:18:12.924,Whoever's pulling the strings busted up the one big corporation into a bunch of little ones.
00:18:14.510,00:18:17.471,"Spread the records far and wide, discourage investigation."
00:18:19.640,00:18:22.893,It's like trying to straighten out a bowl of spaghetti.
00:18:22.976,00:18:24.936,"Well, you could always let it go."
00:18:25.854,00:18:28.315,Not gonna happen.
00:18:28.399,00:18:29.733,I already told you that.
00:18:29.816,00:18:32.778,Stop complaining. This is the job.
00:18:35.614,00:18:39.451,"It's long and boring and complicated, and half the time you still come up empty."
00:18:40.661,00:18:43.997,"Well, you're just a little ray of sunshine."
00:18:44.080,00:18:45.916,Just giving you the lay of the land.
00:18:47.168,00:18:51.338,"For every exposé I've had published, there were a dozen that didn't pan out."
00:18:51.422,00:18:55.134,"All right, all right, so I'm the new girl on the block, I don't know what I'm doing, I get it."
00:18:59.763,00:19:02.766,What about you? What'd you find?
00:19:05.060,00:19:07.271,"Ah, bits and pieces. Yakuza..."
00:19:10.899,00:19:13.527,"Triads, too. Drugs, I think."
00:19:14.820,00:19:19.032,Then there's the bombings that took out the Russians.
00:19:19.115,00:19:23.119,And you think it's all connected to Union Allied?
00:19:23.204,00:19:24.580,Doesn't matter what I think.
00:19:26.582,00:19:30.377,"Wait, what about the cops that got shot?"
00:19:30.461,00:19:33.172,"I mean, you really think that was the guy in the mask?"
00:19:36.132,00:19:39.636,I was standing right next to one of them when it happened.
00:19:41.012,00:19:43.014,Detective named Blake.
00:19:44.850,00:19:47.436,Didn't like each other very much.
00:19:47.519,00:19:49.396,"Yeah, I met him..."
00:19:49.480,00:19:51.857,when they brought me into the precinct.
00:19:52.858,00:19:54.610,I see why you didn't get along.
00:19:54.693,00:19:56.820,Did what I could.
00:19:56.903,00:19:59.323,"If he comes out of a coma, maybe..."
00:19:59.406,00:20:03.285,"maybe he'll thank me, tell me what really happened out there."
00:20:03.369,00:20:05.287,Till then...
00:20:05.371,00:20:07.748,the man in the mask pops up...
00:20:07.831,00:20:10.584,"do me a favor, run the other way."
00:20:11.960,00:20:14.129,"He saved my life, Ben."
00:20:15.256,00:20:18.049,"How do you know he wasn't there just to, um..."
00:20:18.967,00:20:20.552,hurt somebody else?
00:20:22.721,00:20:26.683,I... I never... never thought about it like that.
00:20:26.767,00:20:31.522,"My experience... there are no heroes, no villains."
00:20:31.605,00:20:33.148,Just people with different agendas.
00:20:33.232,00:20:34.941,"Yeah, and one of those was to kill me."
00:20:35.025,00:20:36.277,Mmm-hmm.
00:20:36.360,00:20:37.403,It was.
00:20:37.486,00:20:40.239,"And you're not careful, maybe they'll want a second crack at it."
00:20:42.408,00:20:48.914,The only way I'll ever feel safe again is if the people that you are talking about are put away.
00:20:48.997,00:20:51.917,Then we better try harder to straighten out that spaghetti.
00:20:54.920,00:20:56.046,So...
00:20:57.130,00:20:58.757,if we can connect...
00:21:00.050,00:21:03.679,"the tenements, and the shootings, and Union Allied..."
00:21:04.596,00:21:06.807,that something you'd take to your editor?
00:21:08.309,00:21:10.143,Yeah.
00:21:12.354,00:21:14.064,"But, uh, I think it's a long shot."
00:21:14.147,00:21:18.068,"Well, I was a mean three-point shooter on my high school basketball team."
00:21:18.151,00:21:20.279,I like the long shots.
00:21:20.362,00:21:22.155,"This isn't a game, Karen."
00:21:22.238,00:21:24.533,I... I know that.
00:21:24.616,00:21:30.331,"Anything happens to you... it's gonna be on me, and, uh..."
00:21:33.500,00:21:35.627,I don't want to be responsible for that.
00:21:37.963,00:21:39.423,I can't.
00:21:42.133,00:21:43.594,I'll be okay.
00:22:25.343,00:22:27.137,You have any idea what I pay in rent?
00:22:27.220,00:22:28.847,Expensive shithole.
00:22:30.015,00:22:31.433,You had a woman in here.
00:22:31.517,00:22:32.684,That's none of your business.
00:22:32.768,00:22:34.936,When's she coming back?
00:22:35.812,00:22:37.481,-Never. -Good.
00:22:37.564,00:22:40.233,"You got a warped perspective on the whole good/bad thing, you know that?"
00:22:41.610,00:22:43.570,Women are a distraction.
00:22:44.279,00:22:48.950,"Just like... furniture, apartments..."
00:22:49.701,00:22:50.994,Whoa.
00:22:53.329,00:22:54.706,Silk sheets.
00:22:54.790,00:22:57.042,Cotton feels like sandpaper on my skin.
00:22:58.460,00:23:03.674,You'd be better off sleeping on real sandpaper than surrounding yourself with all this bullshit.
00:23:03.757,00:23:06.802,"This is my life and I made something of it, without you."
00:23:06.885,00:23:09.012,"That's the part that really pisses you off, isn't it?"
00:23:09.095,00:23:12.849,"No, Matty. No, I'm proud of you, I really am."
00:23:12.933,00:23:16.937,"The things you've done, what you've made of yourself, but..."
00:23:19.355,00:23:24.360,"Surrounding yourself with soft stuff isn't life, it's death."
00:23:25.361,00:23:31.910,"Someday those silk sheets are gonna crawl up behind you, wrap themselves around your throat and choke you to death."
00:23:31.993,00:23:33.078,You're a warrior.
00:23:33.161,00:23:34.621,Yeah...
00:23:34.705,00:23:35.956,that's not all I am.
00:23:36.039,00:23:41.002,"A warrior, heir to the Spartans, baddest of the bad-asses."
00:23:41.086,00:23:43.088,They knew what they had to do and they did it.
00:23:43.171,00:23:44.214,And what was that?
00:23:47.676,00:23:50.095,Cut yourself free...
00:23:50.178,00:23:53.431,"from the women, the comforts, the fancy job."
00:23:55.642,00:23:58.311,Do you have friends? People you care about?
00:23:58.394,00:23:59.896,"Yeah, two."
00:23:59.980,00:24:02.107,"Cut 'em loose, for their sake."
00:24:02.190,00:24:04.985,"Break their hearts if you have to, just do it quick."
00:24:05.068,00:24:06.236,I'm not gonna do that.
00:24:06.319,00:24:09.155,Then they will suffer and you will die.
00:24:10.532,00:24:14.119,Relationships are a luxury men like you and me can't afford.
00:24:14.202,00:24:15.621,Is that why you left?
00:24:17.706,00:24:19.290,Huh? To protect me?
00:24:19.374,00:24:21.042,I had my reasons.
00:24:21.126,00:24:22.544,I was a kid.
00:24:23.754,00:24:25.213,You still are.
00:24:28.509,00:24:31.762,Think I'll bury my sorrows between the legs of a supermodel.
00:24:31.845,00:24:32.929,"Don't push it, Stick."
00:24:33.013,00:24:34.931,Or what?
00:24:35.015,00:24:37.183,I'm trying to teach you how to stay alive.
00:24:37.267,00:24:39.352,"Christ, you're worse than your old man."
00:24:42.105,00:24:45.108,At least your daddy got paid when he hit the floor.
00:24:47.569,00:24:48.862,You're hurting me.
00:24:48.945,00:24:50.989,Make me stop.
00:24:51.072,00:24:52.908,-I can't. -Then quit.
00:24:52.991,00:24:54.785,Murdocks never quit.
00:24:58.914,00:25:00.040,Then beat me.
00:25:05.712,00:25:07.255,You're just a bully.
00:25:12.761,00:25:13.762,Feel the breeze.
00:25:18.308,00:25:19.976,"You got heart, kid."
00:25:20.894,00:25:22.395,But heart's not enough.
00:25:22.478,00:25:24.731,You've got to control that rage.
00:25:24.815,00:25:26.024,You said anger's a weapon.
00:25:26.107,00:25:28.569,"Anger is a spark, good."
00:25:28.652,00:25:34.157,"Rage is a wildfire, out of control, therefore useless."
00:25:34.240,00:25:36.284,Just like you laying there.
00:25:46.461,00:25:48.546,I thought Murdocks never quit.
00:25:53.594,00:25:55.095,"I did it, I killed him!"
00:25:55.178,00:25:56.221,Killed who?
00:25:56.304,00:25:58.014,My dad.
00:26:00.558,00:26:02.518,They paid him to lose against Creel.
00:26:02.603,00:26:05.188,But... But I wanted him to win.
00:26:05.271,00:26:06.982,So he did because of me.
00:26:07.065,00:26:08.817,Because of me.
00:26:10.652,00:26:12.613,I just wanted him to come home.
00:26:12.696,00:26:14.948,"But he didn't, and he never will."
00:26:15.031,00:26:17.659,"We all pay for our choices, kid."
00:26:18.619,00:26:22.789,"Maybe your old man fought for you, maybe he did it for himself."
00:26:22.873,00:26:26.710,The only thing you know for sure is he's gone now.
00:26:28.419,00:26:29.587,But I'm here.
00:26:30.631,00:26:32.883,"Now, get up."
00:26:32.966,00:26:36.302,Time to stop taking a beating and start giving one.
00:26:38.054,00:26:39.848,Get up.
00:26:42.684,00:26:43.894,Get up.
00:26:45.771,00:26:46.980,Get up!
00:26:55.071,00:26:59.117,"Come on, kid. Show me I'm not wasting my time."
00:27:14.299,00:27:17.302,Took you 20 years to learn how to get out of that one.
00:27:18.219,00:27:19.971,"Yeah, I've learned a lot since you've been gone."
00:27:20.055,00:27:21.556,-Like what? -You're a dick.
00:27:21.639,00:27:23.725,That's true.
00:27:23.809,00:27:25.060,You got any beer?
00:27:29.022,00:27:30.106,I'll bet...
00:27:31.441,00:27:34.695,"it's that German piss, isn't it?"
00:27:35.696,00:27:38.156,So you gonna tell me why you're here?
00:27:38.239,00:27:40.951,Or is the suspense supposed to kill me?
00:27:49.918,00:27:52.045,With who? You never got around to that part.
00:27:52.128,00:27:55.381,"Now, the Japanese, mostly."
00:27:55.465,00:27:59.052,"Look, I don't want you tearing up Hell's Kitchen going after the yakuza."
00:28:01.596,00:28:04.432,You don't know what's going on in your own backyard.
00:28:04.515,00:28:09.020,"The guy that was yappin' with that old man you slapped around, he's pretty high up."
00:28:09.104,00:28:12.858,He goes by a lot of names. Using Nobu this time around.
00:28:14.025,00:28:17.612,"So, Nobu, you want him so bad, why'd you let him get away back in the garage?"
00:28:19.239,00:28:22.658,I want what's on the ship he's meeting at the docks tonight.
00:28:22.743,00:28:24.870,"Right, Owlsley was talking about that."
00:28:25.912,00:28:28.289,What's Nobu bringing in? Drugs or something?
00:28:28.373,00:28:30.041,A weapon.
00:28:30.125,00:28:32.961,"They call it Black Sky, the bringer of shadows."
00:28:33.044,00:28:34.045,What kind of weapon?
00:28:34.129,00:28:36.714,The kind you don't want in your world.
00:28:38.383,00:28:39.425,Just say it.
00:28:41.636,00:28:44.055,I want you to help yourself.
00:28:44.139,00:28:46.725,Nobu and his guys are in tight with Fisk.
00:28:46.808,00:28:52.563,"You hurt them, you hurt baldy-- I know a lot of shit."
00:28:52.647,00:28:55.650,"This beer, for example, sucks."
00:28:55.734,00:28:59.695,"After all your talk about cutting friends loose, and..."
00:29:00.530,00:29:01.572,now you need one.
00:29:01.656,00:29:05.285,I don't need a friend. I need a soldier. Committed.
00:29:05.368,00:29:08.329,Not some bleeding heart idealist hanging onto half measures.
00:29:08.413,00:29:11.082,You don't know anything about what I'm doing here.
00:29:11.166,00:29:13.877,"Kid, in war, people die."
00:29:13.960,00:29:16.797,"If it's not you, it's the guy next to you."
00:29:19.090,00:29:23.344,How many men have you killed protecting this city?
00:29:28.016,00:29:30.435,You're still afraid to cross that line.
00:29:30.518,00:29:33.980,"Someday, it's gonna come down to you or the other guy."
00:29:34.064,00:29:36.482,"If it's not Fisk, somebody else."
00:29:36.566,00:29:38.151,What're you gonna do then?
00:29:38.234,00:29:41.612,"Yeah, a Russian asshole asked me the same thing recently..."
00:29:41.696,00:29:43.073,right before he died.
00:29:43.156,00:29:45.616,Are you the one that put him in the ground?
00:29:46.117,00:29:47.202,No.
00:29:48.787,00:29:50.621,"Half measures, Matty."
00:29:52.207,00:29:54.167,"Ah, screw it."
00:29:55.543,00:29:57.879,Ride with me tonight...
00:29:57.963,00:30:03.176,"help me destroy Black Sky, keep it off the streets, and I promise you this..."
00:30:03.259,00:30:12.352,Wilson Fisk will know the taste of fear the day he faces you 'cause he'll know that you kicked the guy he's afraid of right in the nuts.
00:30:14.229,00:30:15.480,"What do you say, kid?"
00:30:16.940,00:30:18.233,One rule...
00:30:19.192,00:30:20.485,you don't kill anybody.
00:30:23.279,00:30:27.242,I swear I will not kill anybody.
00:30:30.745,00:30:31.997,Pussy.
00:30:37.793,00:30:38.920,Uh...
00:31:23.882,00:31:25.091,Oh.
00:31:40.148,00:31:41.232,"Oh, uh..."
00:32:26.736,00:32:28.196,Ugh. Oh.
00:32:28.279,00:32:29.280,Excuse me.
00:32:29.364,00:32:30.740,"No, no."
00:32:52.512,00:32:53.804,One was bald.
00:33:29.382,00:33:30.591,"No, no, no. Elena..."
00:33:44.647,00:33:45.856,Sorry.
00:33:49.902,00:33:50.945,Um...
00:33:54.782,00:33:56.576,I got to New York.
00:33:56.659,00:33:57.702,Oh.
00:33:59.995,00:34:01.081,Adiós.
00:34:41.079,00:34:42.997,"So, why you bothering the old woman?"
00:34:43.081,00:34:44.749,Get off of me!
00:34:45.291,00:34:47.585,-Ahh! -She gonna spray you.
00:34:47.668,00:34:50.880,"Maybe I take that away from you, empty the whole thing in your face."
00:34:50.963,00:34:53.591,Burn your eyes out so you don't go snooping where you're not supposed to.
00:34:55.009,00:34:56.969,-Ahh! -Stupid bitch!
00:35:03.058,00:35:06.020,"Foggy? Oh, my God."
00:35:09.357,00:35:11.025,-What are you doing here? -What are you doing here?
00:35:11.109,00:35:13.068,-What are you doing here? -Are you following me?
00:35:14.612,00:35:17.448,Because you were acting weird. I was worried about you.
00:35:22.745,00:35:25.290,"Let's discuss that away from the maniacs, okay?"
00:35:25.373,00:35:27.583,"-Come on! -Oh, shit."
00:35:52.525,00:35:54.277,How many do you read?
00:35:55.445,00:35:57.655,I'm picking up a dozen heartbeats.
00:35:58.281,00:36:00.950,"Slow, steady, not even a flutter."
00:36:02.368,00:36:03.869,There's one more.
00:36:04.787,00:36:05.996,Stronger...
00:36:07.540,00:36:08.541,different.
00:36:09.083,00:36:10.460,Nobu.
00:36:14.380,00:36:15.756,Huh.
00:36:15.840,00:36:17.508,Somebody wants things quiet.
00:36:17.592,00:36:19.344,We'll be quieter.
00:36:22.638,00:36:24.765,-You remember how to use these? -I won't need 'em.
00:36:24.849,00:36:25.933,"Yeah, you will."
00:36:26.851,00:36:28.769,Thin out the herd.
00:36:28.853,00:36:31.481,-I'll take care of the Black Sky. -How?
00:36:31.564,00:36:34.234,"Just do your job, I'll do mine. Move."
00:39:12.683,00:39:13.768,Break.
00:39:14.519,00:39:16.020,What rules the body?
00:39:16.103,00:39:17.146,My mind.
00:39:21.442,00:39:22.527,My body.
00:39:29.909,00:39:32.244,"Connection, mind, body?"
00:39:33.203,00:39:39.460,"The mind controls the body, the body controls our enemies, our enemies control jack shit by the time we're done with them."
00:39:39.544,00:39:40.795,Right.
00:39:44.131,00:39:46.258,Fighting is just the start.
00:39:48.719,00:39:51.889,You have to control your feelings...
00:39:51.972,00:39:54.475,your deep down inside feelings.
00:39:54.559,00:39:57.061,-How? -Meditate.
00:39:57.144,00:39:59.522,You mean that thing where you pretend not to sleep?
00:40:01.273,00:40:03.943,"Yeah. Yeah, that one."
00:40:05.235,00:40:12.034,"Open yourself up to it... learn it, make you way stronger, more focused."
00:40:12.952,00:40:15.245,Even heal your wounds faster.
00:40:15.329,00:40:16.371,You can do that?
00:40:16.456,00:40:18.499,"How do you think I'm still alive, kid?"
00:40:18.583,00:40:20.501,"I'll learn how, just like you."
00:40:20.585,00:40:22.252,Good.
00:40:22.336,00:40:24.880,Tomorrow we start with knives.
00:40:24.964,00:40:27.007,Try not to get stabbed.
00:40:28.008,00:40:29.969,-Stick? -Yeah?
00:40:31.512,00:40:33.514,I have something for you.
00:40:39.103,00:40:41.146,It's a bracelet.
00:40:42.482,00:40:45.818,From the wrapper on the ice cream you got me when we first met.
00:40:46.819,00:40:48.488,You remember?
00:40:49.404,00:40:50.990,I do.
00:41:01.125,00:41:02.835,Your training is over.
00:41:04.169,00:41:06.005,I can't help you anymore.
00:41:11.469,00:41:12.595,What?
00:41:13.888,00:41:14.889,Why?
00:41:16.891,00:41:19.059,I expected too much of you.
00:41:59.016,00:42:01.060,You promised me you weren't gonna kill anyone.
00:42:01.686,00:42:02.812,Yep.
00:42:04.814,00:42:06.857,Then what the hell was that back there?
00:42:06.941,00:42:08.358,The mission.
00:42:10.360,00:42:13.948,That's what your war's come to? Killing children?
00:42:14.990,00:42:17.409,That thing in the container was not a child.
00:42:17.492,00:42:18.911,I could hear his heartbeat.
00:42:18.994,00:42:21.747,It was light and fast. He hadn't even hit puberty.
00:42:21.831,00:42:24.291,"-You're emotional. -Yeah, no shit."
00:42:25.668,00:42:31.632,"If you'd have focused beyond your crybaby feelings, you would've sensed what that kid really was."
00:42:31.716,00:42:33.383,He was just a kid.
00:42:34.635,00:42:36.596,You're blind as you ever were.
00:42:37.304,00:42:40.474,Maybe you should've stuck around and finished training me yourself.
00:42:40.558,00:42:43.769,I needed a soldier. You wanted a father.
00:42:44.687,00:42:47.189,"Well, I guess we're both disappointed then."
00:42:47.272,00:42:48.858,I guess we are.
00:42:52.820,00:42:54.238,"You take care of yourself, Matty."
00:42:54.321,00:42:55.948,I'm not gonna let you kill that kid.
00:42:56.991,00:42:58.576,"Oh, he's already dead."
00:42:58.659,00:43:02.913,I caught up with the van while you were dicking around with Nobu's men.
00:43:04.039,00:43:06.125,I put an arrow in that thing's heart.
00:43:21.140,00:43:23.934,You can't even tag an old man.
00:43:50.460,00:43:51.671,Get up.
00:43:56.133,00:43:57.342,Get up!
00:44:01.972,00:44:03.223,Get up!
00:45:04.201,00:45:05.619,Get out of my city.
00:45:13.794,00:45:16.171,Maybe there's hope for you yet.
00:45:29.559,00:45:31.270,Nice catching up.
00:45:31.937,00:45:32.980,Eh?
00:45:33.856,00:45:37.567,You can keep the sticks. You're gonna need 'em.
00:45:49.830,00:45:52.958,What part of Don't tell anyone about this didn't you understand?
00:45:53.042,00:45:54.709,Foggy's not just anyone... all right?
00:45:54.794,00:45:57.963,"He's a kick-ass attorney, and sooner or later we're gonna need one of those."
00:45:59.256,00:46:01.383,And he just plain kicks ass.
00:46:02.509,00:46:04.094,When the need arises.
00:46:07.848,00:46:09.892,He's one of the good ones.
00:46:12.102,00:46:13.979,Show him the board.
00:46:15.689,00:46:17.983,"All right, Ben has everything laid out..."
00:46:18.067,00:46:22.696,"all of the, uh, possible connections... starting at the bottom..."
00:46:22.779,00:46:25.074,and moving up.
00:46:25.950,00:46:27.201,The king of diamonds?
00:46:27.284,00:46:28.869,The man at the top.
00:46:28.953,00:46:30.412,Any idea who he is?
00:46:30.495,00:46:31.831,No.
00:46:31.914,00:46:34.291,But I think he might have been the one behind Union Allied.
00:46:34.374,00:46:36.919,There's another player on the field.
00:46:38.045,00:46:39.379,Man in black.
00:46:39.463,00:46:41.715,You think he's working for the king?
00:46:41.798,00:46:43.092,No.
00:46:43.175,00:46:47.179,"No, he never would have helped me expose Union Allied if he were."
00:46:48.513,00:46:50.099,If that's the case...
00:46:51.350,00:46:52.935,they're working against each other.
00:46:53.978,00:46:55.770,So the question is...
00:46:59.691,00:47:01.776,which one trumps the other?
00:48:08.718,00:48:10.012,It's done.
00:48:11.055,00:48:12.264,Black Sky...
00:48:13.848,00:48:15.684,no longer a threat.
00:48:19.063,00:48:20.814,What about Murdock?
00:48:22.983,00:48:26.403,"Stubborn, immature..."
00:48:29.156,00:48:31.700,still a real pain in the ass.
00:48:32.742,00:48:35.162,Will he be ready when the doors open?
00:48:42.169,00:48:45.089,I have no idea.
00:31:49.407,00:31:54.495,"And you speak my tongue, do you not?"
00:31:56.081,00:31:58.291,How long have you known?
00:31:59.125,00:32:01.044,Since the beginning.
00:32:01.127,00:32:05.131,It is the clever man who plays the fool.
00:32:05.215,00:32:07.258,And a foolish woman...
00:32:07.342,00:32:08.343,who does not recognize it.
00:32:12.180,00:32:19.895,"Tell me, has Nobu guessed you speak Japanese as well?"
00:32:19.980,00:32:22.607,"I don't believe so, no."
00:32:43.461,00:32:46.422,Nobu isn't very happy with you.
00:32:46.506,00:32:51.594,That man is never happy with anyone.
00:32:51.677,00:32:53.554,True.
00:32:54.639,00:32:56.474,But...
00:32:56.557,00:32:58.434,I have heard Leland...
00:32:58.518,00:33:00.603,is equally displeased.
00:33:00.686,00:33:04.274,It's under control.
00:33:05.566,00:33:07.110,How do you think...
00:33:07.193,00:33:09.529,"I knew where you live, Wilson?"
00:33:11.990,00:33:16.702,"This is one of your most guarded secrets, yes?"
00:33:16.786,00:33:19.539,The king in his castle.
00:33:20.873,00:33:30.175,"Did I divine the location from bones and spells, chanted beneath the moonlight?"
00:33:31.384,00:33:32.385,No.
00:33:33.803,00:33:37.640,I discovered it because...
00:33:37.723,00:33:40.268,you have become sloppy.
00:33:42.603,00:33:44.355,And emotional.
00:33:46.066,00:33:51.321,"Just as the Russians became, in their final moments."
00:33:57.952,00:34:04.792,"Recent events have been trying, I admit."
00:34:04.875,00:34:12.842,But I promise-- I am not here to pluck flowers from a thicket.
00:34:13.718,00:34:18.598,"This is a courtesy, because you have shown me respect."
00:34:25.271,00:34:28.316,Restore your house to order.
00:34:31.069,00:34:33.321,Or I will begin dealing...
00:34:33.404,00:34:35.948,with Nobu and Leland directly.
00:34:40.953,00:34:43.164,Gratitude for the tea.
00:05:34.250,00:05:36.335,You know what he would say.
00:05:37.294,00:05:38.421,That we're awesome?
00:05:43.635,00:05:46.471,"Yeah, that's lawyer talk for stupid. You want coffee?"
00:05:48.055,00:05:52.143,"If we're gonna be Nancy Drew-ing together, I think a certain level of honesty is required."
00:05:52.226,00:05:53.895,What? You don't like my coffee?
00:05:55.730,00:06:03.905,"I appreciate the effort, but the technique, or lack thereof-- On occasion some dickery may leak out, but doesn't mean I'm wrong."
00:06:03.988,00:06:05.281,"Well, it means somethin'."
00:06:05.364,00:06:07.158,"Okay, let's say we keep Matt in the dark."
00:06:07.241,00:06:12.664,"How long do you think-- I should grow my hair? Matt, what's your take on that?"
00:06:16.250,00:06:18.920,-Don't tell me what? -Damn it!
00:06:20.254,00:06:21.714,Guy's like a bat.
00:06:21.798,00:06:24.842,"Not blind like a-- I mean, you know, with the hearing."
00:06:24.926,00:06:26.511,"-Bats aren't blind, Foggy. -They're not?"
00:06:26.594,00:06:27.637,It's a myth.
00:06:28.430,00:06:29.431,"So, we're good."
00:06:30.389,00:06:31.516,-Karen. -Yeah?
00:06:31.599,00:06:34.602,What don't the two of you want me to know?
00:06:36.938,00:06:38.731,We're investigating Union Allied.
00:06:38.815,00:06:40.858,Remind me to keep you off the witness stand.
00:06:40.942,00:06:42.444,-You can't be doing that. -Why not?
00:06:42.527,00:06:45.029,"For starters, you signed legal papers and took money to leave it alone."
00:06:45.112,00:06:48.658,"No, I signed papers saying that I wouldn't go public and I won't."
00:06:48.741,00:06:51.536,-We have someone lined up for that part. -What part?
00:06:53.287,00:06:55.247,"Breaking the story that, uh..."
00:06:55.331,00:07:05.800,"Look, whoever is behind Union Allied, or whatever they call themselves now, they are trying to strong-arm people like Elena so that they can sweep their homes away from them and build condos no one can afford."
00:07:05.883,00:07:09.261,And what do you think's gonna happen when these whoevers find out what it is you're up to?
00:07:09.345,00:07:11.889,-We already took care of it. -Took care of what?
00:07:13.390,00:07:17.061,"The, uh, guys who busted up Elena's apartment."
00:07:17.144,00:07:20.690,"They, uh, came after me when I was leaving her place last night."
00:07:20.773,00:07:21.774,Are you okay?
00:07:23.150,00:07:25.570,Foggy was following me.
00:07:25.653,00:07:28.197,-Mmm-hmm. Why? Why were you following her? -She was acting funny.
00:07:28.280,00:07:30.575,"-No, there was no funny. -There was a little funny."
00:07:30.658,00:07:33.410,This is what I'm talking about. There are things out there.
00:07:33.495,00:07:35.412,You can't be doing this. You're gonna get yourselves hurt.
00:07:35.497,00:07:38.833,"No, I have already been hurt by those bastards."
00:07:39.876,00:07:44.631,"You know, I don't care what I signed or how much money they paid me to forget. I don't."
00:07:44.714,00:07:50.302,And I'm not just going to stick my head in the sand and let it happen to somebody else because I am scared.
00:07:50.386,00:07:53.222,Which I am... a lot.
00:07:54.974,00:07:57.560,"And if you could see her face, you'd know she means it."
00:07:57.644,00:07:59.311,"Yeah, I kind of got that."
00:08:05.192,00:08:08.613,Who's helping you break whatever it is you think you're gonna find out?
00:08:08.696,00:08:10.573,"Ben Urich, from the Bulletin."
00:08:10.657,00:08:13.159,The one who wrote the Union Allied piece?
00:08:13.242,00:08:15.327,Karen's been working with him. He seems like a good guy.
00:08:17.955,00:08:20.833,"No, I trust Ben as much as I do you or Foggy, Matt."
00:08:20.917,00:08:26.798,I know what I am doing. I am not some kid-- Then don't act like one. Both of you.
00:08:27.924,00:08:30.927,"I know you're just trying to do the right thing here, but we have to be smart about this."
00:08:31.010,00:08:32.011,We?
00:08:32.094,00:08:35.515,"First rule, no more skulking around, asking to get hurt."
00:08:35.598,00:08:38.475,"We do this, it's gonna be on our turf. The legal system."
00:08:38.560,00:08:40.520,That's not nearly as heroic as you might think.
00:08:40.603,00:08:43.022,"I don't want anyone to be a hero, Karen. I want you to be safe."
00:08:43.105,00:08:45.858,And I want to protect this firm and everything we're trying to build here.
00:08:45.942,00:08:49.153,We know the law. We'll use it to our advantage.
00:08:50.613,00:08:51.614,Agreed?
00:08:52.865,00:08:53.950,Do we have a choice?
00:08:54.742,00:08:56.077,Not so much.
00:08:59.997,00:09:01.290,"So, what's the second rule?"
00:09:03.125,00:09:05.878,"I don't know, I'm making this up as I go along."
00:09:10.049,00:09:13.803,I understand your position. You need to understand mine!
00:09:19.976,00:09:23.479,I say it is of piss and shit.
00:09:24.521,00:09:28.150,"Well, I'm sorry you feel that way. Nevertheless, my point is valid."
00:09:28.234,00:09:31.237,You made guarantees.
00:09:33.447,00:09:39.746,You asked that the docks and your transit path be clear of police interference.
00:09:44.541,00:09:45.542,No.
00:09:45.627,00:09:48.004,"Of course not, because I'm a man of honor!"
00:09:48.087,00:09:50.965,It will be difficult to locate another Black Sky.
00:09:51.048,00:09:53.885,They are extremely rare.
00:09:53.968,00:09:59.265,Perhaps you should have told me the importance of your cargo before you lost it.
00:10:09.191,00:10:11.235,the terms of your relationship.
00:10:11.318,00:10:12.904,I'm...
00:10:15.281,00:10:17.033,sorry if I offended you.
00:10:17.116,00:10:19.201,My apologies.
00:10:39.931,00:10:41.265,You get that last part?
00:10:45.853,00:10:47.271,He needs to be taught some manners.
00:10:47.354,00:10:48.856,Leave it alone.
00:10:49.899,00:10:53.444,If the Russians had spoken to you this way-- They aren't the Russians.
00:10:53.527,00:10:55.988,"No, the Russians actually contributed."
00:10:56.072,00:11:02.829,"Leland's financials, Gao's product, and Vlad and Anatoly's distribution until we absorbed that facet."
00:11:04.205,00:11:05.622,What do Nobu and his men bring to the table?
00:11:05.707,00:11:08.793,What-- What are they in all this?
00:11:08.876,00:11:10.586,A necessary evil.
00:11:11.628,00:11:15.341,"I just-- I don't like the way he speaks to you, that's all."
00:11:15.424,00:11:18.510,"Especially now, when everything's going our way."
00:11:19.428,00:11:22.724,That's exactly when you need to be cautious.
00:12:01.428,00:12:03.555,Your mom don't like music.
00:12:06.392,00:12:08.602,-I like it. -That's 'cause you got taste.
00:12:08.685,00:12:10.562,I love music. Just not so loud.
00:12:10.646,00:12:13.024,What the hell good is it if you can't hear it?
00:12:13.107,00:12:14.566,"-Right, Willie? -Right!"
00:12:14.650,00:12:15.985,Never trust the quiet ones.
00:12:16.068,00:12:18.654,Those are the pricks that are always up to something.
00:12:20.697,00:12:22.074,You cut it too short.
00:12:22.158,00:12:23.826,What did I tell you?
00:12:23.910,00:12:24.952,Sorry.
00:12:25.036,00:12:26.453,"Sorry, what?"
00:12:26.537,00:12:27.997,Sir.
00:12:28.915,00:12:31.292,Respect. You gotta give it if you want it.
00:12:31.375,00:12:33.419,Don't forget that.
00:12:33.502,00:12:34.921,Make the next one longer.
00:12:35.004,00:12:37.173,You want your pop's face in the dirt?
00:12:44.346,00:12:47.183,You see that? That's our ticket.
00:12:47.266,00:12:51.478,"Once you get on the city council, everybody wants to put a little somethin' in your pocket."
00:12:52.396,00:12:54.899,Remember Mr. Flores from up the street?
00:12:56.608,00:12:59.653,You know why? 'Cause he got on the council back when you were still shitting in your pants.
00:12:59.736,00:13:01.155,Bill!
00:13:01.238,00:13:02.489,But he ain't around no more.
00:13:02.573,00:13:07.494,"One year after he got voted in, packed up, got himself a real house."
00:13:07.578,00:13:08.745,Really?
00:13:08.830,00:13:10.331,Just like we're gonna buy.
00:13:13.417,00:13:15.920,This city? It's everything.
00:13:16.628,00:13:17.922,It's right there.
00:13:18.714,00:13:21.884,All you gotta do is put your mind to it and make it happen.
00:13:24.511,00:13:25.512,You want a sip?
00:13:32.603,00:13:34.355,Go on. What are you lookin' at her for?
00:13:34.438,00:13:36.357,I said it's okay. Take a big one.
00:13:37.816,00:13:39.193,Go on.
00:13:41.737,00:13:42.779,That's it.
00:13:45.950,00:13:48.452,"Come on, it's funny. He's a man."
00:13:48.535,00:13:49.578,Let him be a man.
00:13:53.332,00:13:54.458,How are we paying for all this?
00:13:59.755,00:14:01.715,Got it covered. I took a loan.
00:14:01.798,00:14:03.050,A loan?
00:14:03.134,00:14:06.137,"-What'd the bank make you put up? -No, no, no. Screw the bank."
00:14:06.220,00:14:07.221,Rigoletto floated me.
00:14:16.688,00:14:19.733,"Once I get on the council, this is all taken care of."
00:14:19.816,00:14:22.736,-I don't know about all this. -You don't know about nothin'!
00:14:22.819,00:14:24.613,You gotta take risks.
00:14:24.696,00:14:27.867,"You want something out of life, you gotta put yourself out there."
00:14:27.950,00:14:30.744,"You gotta put yourself out there, Mom!"
00:14:40.546,00:14:42.298,"Yes, honestly."
00:14:42.381,00:14:46.427,I've spent most of my time abroad in Asia.
00:14:46.510,00:14:47.511,Yes.
00:14:47.594,00:14:49.263,I would.
00:14:54.768,00:14:56.938,Could you please hold on a second?
00:15:04.403,00:15:08.157,I'm so sorry. I need to take this.
00:15:09.992,00:15:13.454,"I know, me, too. Good night, Vanessa."
00:15:16.290,00:15:17.291,Yes?
00:15:17.374,00:15:19.751,We have a situation.
00:15:22.796,00:15:26.717,Our contacts in the media tell us that it's gonna be tonight's lead.
00:15:26.800,00:15:29.720,Has he said anything we need to be concerned about?
00:15:29.803,00:15:32.514,"No, he's conscious, but his injuries were extensive."
00:15:32.598,00:15:33.890,I'm hearing he can't speak yet.
00:15:33.975,00:15:38.312,"That changes, unlikely he's gonna be overjoyed we had him shot."
00:15:38.395,00:15:39.396,Yes.
00:15:39.480,00:15:40.814,Well...
00:15:42.524,00:15:43.650,take care of him.
00:15:43.734,00:15:46.028,That poses an issue.
00:15:46.112,00:15:51.700,"There's a detail on his floor. Twenty-four hour presence, in case the man in the mask tries to finish the job."
00:15:51.783,00:15:53.452,Are any of them ours?
00:15:53.535,00:15:57.456,"Two... but not on the door. They try to get in, it'll be noticed."
00:16:03.963,00:16:08.425,"I can reach out, but they go back, since before the academy. I, uh..."
00:16:08.509,00:16:10.761,I doubt he'll be receptive.
00:16:13.222,00:16:15.307,and I'll speak with him myself.
00:16:15.391,00:16:16.808,Understood.
00:16:21.563,00:16:23.482,"This is pointless, Matt."
00:16:23.565,00:16:27.111,"We should be out on the streets, cracking names and taking skulls."
00:16:27.194,00:16:29.946,-I think you have that backwards. -Not the way I do it.
00:16:33.242,00:16:37.829,"Hey, I handled myself pretty damn skippy against baldy and his tattooed gorilla."
00:16:37.913,00:16:39.206,"-Tell him, K. -No, you did."
00:16:39.290,00:16:41.583,"What? I'm-- What, I'm K now?"
00:16:46.588,00:16:48.424,Confederated Global Investments.
00:16:48.507,00:16:51.635,The company that hired us to defend that bowling alley nut?
00:16:51.718,00:16:55.056,"Yeah. Karen, do you have a list of the subsidiaries you were able to track down through their check?"
00:16:55.139,00:16:57.474,"Uh, yeah, yeah, I think so."
00:16:58.934,00:17:00.019,"Yeah, yeah, I got it."
00:17:00.102,00:17:02.146,Can you tell me if...
00:17:07.234,00:17:09.820,Um...
00:17:09.903,00:17:11.738,"Yeah. Yeah, it is."
00:17:11.822,00:17:15.659,There are half a dozen complaints against them for doing the same thing they did at Elena's tenement.
00:17:15.742,00:17:18.079,Confed Global's trying to force renters out of tenements?
00:17:20.872,00:17:22.708,"I mean, he's gotta know something about this."
00:17:24.710,00:17:25.711,"Oh, come on!"
00:17:30.466,00:17:31.508,"Oh, my God."
00:17:31.592,00:17:39.558,"-What do you got? -Uh, no, it's not, um-- The New York Bulletin online just reported that that cop that got shot, he just regained consciousness."
00:17:42.018,00:17:44.563,"Still, he didn't deserve a bullet from that masked douchebag."
00:17:49.235,00:17:50.861,Be interested in what he has to say.
00:17:50.944,00:17:53.114,"Yeah, so would I."
00:17:55.907,00:18:00.412,I know that you have... feelings regarding this matter.
00:18:04.500,00:18:09.755,But if Detective Blake chooses to speak out of turn...
00:18:11.715,00:18:16.512,"the result would be... unpleasant, for you and for me."
00:18:16.595,00:18:19.223,Out of turn? You shot him.
00:18:20.224,00:18:23.810,"Technically, we paid someone else to shoot him."
00:18:24.853,00:18:27.148,Do you know what made us go down this path?
00:18:27.231,00:18:31.067,What led to a decision of such finality?
00:18:31.152,00:18:34.113,"If you're worried about me, I know how to keep my mouth shut."
00:18:34.196,00:18:37.658,"If we doubted that, we wouldn't be having this conversation."
00:18:41.495,00:18:43.830,knowing facts as they are...
00:18:45.541,00:18:52.923,"not how we wish to perceive them, can tip the balance between life and death."
00:18:53.840,00:18:58.094,"Unlike you, your partner was inconsistent in his attention to detail."
00:18:58.179,00:19:01.014,"Well, that masked asshole beat him senseless and broke his arm."
00:19:01.097,00:19:02.474,It wasn't his fault.
00:19:06.603,00:19:09.190,is we were not alerted...
00:19:09.273,00:19:13.235,that the addresses we provided had been compromised.
00:19:13.319,00:19:21.660,They were given to ensure that any Russian who survived the bombings would be properly attended to.
00:19:21.743,00:19:26.122,Not to aid the man in the mask at locating Vladimir Ranskahov.
00:19:27.040,00:19:29.751,That led to an unfortunate complication.
00:19:30.752,00:19:35.757,One that your partner was directly responsible for.
00:19:39.094,00:19:41.972,"So, how long before I do something that pisses you off?"
00:19:42.055,00:19:45.517,"Oh, the answer to that is entirely up to you."
00:19:52.233,00:19:56.027,"See, he's more than my partner, right?"
00:19:56.111,00:19:57.904,He's my friend.
00:19:57.988,00:20:01.867,"I've known him since I was a kid. That's 30, 35 years."
00:20:10.417,00:20:12.043,How much...
00:20:13.086,00:20:15.589,are each of those years worth to you?
00:20:16.590,00:20:17.633,Hmm?
00:20:17.716,00:20:20.219,In round figures?
00:21:07.266,00:21:08.267,-Hey. -Hey.
00:21:08.350,00:21:09.351,"Good news, right?"
00:21:09.435,00:21:11.061,"Yeah, he always was a tough son of a bitch."
00:21:13.522,00:21:15.357,"Oh, yeah, sure, sure."
00:21:18.234,00:21:20.821,-And I gotta check the bag. -Yeah.
00:21:24.366,00:21:25.659,"Mmm, meatball?"
00:21:25.742,00:21:27.744,"Yeah, from Marchioni's. He loves that place."
00:21:27.828,00:21:29.871,"I don't know, I thought it might trigger something."
00:21:29.955,00:21:31.415,"-Yeah. Well, come on in. -Thanks."
00:22:03.322,00:22:04.448,I'm sorry.
00:22:21.590,00:22:22.841,What are you doin'?
00:22:54.790,00:22:58.251,I need you to listen to me. We don't have much time.
00:22:58.334,00:23:02.464,Whatever your partner just injected you with has already reached your heart.
00:23:03.965,00:23:05.509,You're gonna be dead soon.
00:23:05.592,00:23:06.885,And there's nothing anyone can do about it.
00:23:08.053,00:23:10.889,But you can make the man responsible for this pay for what he's done.
00:23:13.183,00:23:15.226,Tell me everything you know about Wilson Fisk.
00:23:21.817,00:23:23.401,"Hoffman, what the hell is going on in there?"
00:23:30.325,00:23:31.660,"Move, move, move!"
00:23:33.328,00:23:34.955,-Move! -Come on! Let's go!
00:23:41.086,00:23:45.507,Look at my face. I can't go into the office like this.
00:23:45.591,00:23:49.177,I'm afraid to go anywhere with that masked psychopath running around.
00:23:50.428,00:23:52.388,My son was coming to visit.
00:23:52.473,00:23:56.977,"I had to tell him, Nope, stay out of New York, Lee. Shit's goin' on."
00:23:57.060,00:23:59.521,I'm 73 years old.
00:23:59.605,00:24:02.065,You know how many times I have left to see him?
00:24:02.983,00:24:05.110,"I apologize for the inconvenience, Leland."
00:24:05.193,00:24:07.654,I'm not looking for-- Are you done?
00:24:07.738,00:24:09.573,This thing itches like a son of a bitch.
00:24:09.656,00:24:11.324,It'll keep you safe when he's finished.
00:24:12.450,00:24:14.828,What's this coated with?
00:24:14.911,00:24:18.373,"Polyethylene, glycol, silicate."
00:24:18.456,00:24:22.794,"-Hydro-clusters form when kinetic energy-- -Yeah, great. I'm a 46 long."
00:24:23.712,00:24:26.339,"-That'll be all, Mr. Potter. -Okay."
00:24:27.841,00:24:30.135,"You need anything else, Mr. Fisk, sir?"
00:24:30.218,00:24:32.971,"-Not today, Mr. Potter. Thank you. -Okay."
00:24:37.684,00:24:38.727,Kid's half an idiot.
00:24:39.645,00:24:41.688,It's the other half that counts.
00:24:41.772,00:24:42.773,So...
00:24:42.856,00:24:46.568,what am I supposed to do here? Seriously?
00:24:46.652,00:24:47.778,He knows who I am.
00:24:47.861,00:24:51.447,"He found me once, he'll do it again."
00:24:51.532,00:24:55.493,I'll move you someplace safe until it's resolved.
00:24:55.577,00:24:58.288,-I'll put six men on you. -Make it a dozen.
00:24:58.371,00:25:02.208,"If he drops me off a roof, an awful lot of money is going along for the ride."
00:25:02.292,00:25:05.962,"-That sounds like a threat. -No, just stating the obvious."
00:25:06.880,00:25:08.757,Never thought I'd have to with you.
00:25:15.388,00:25:16.765,Is it taken care of?
00:25:16.848,00:25:18.642,"Yes, but there was a complication."
00:25:18.725,00:25:22.353,"Well, there's a word I'm hearing more and more."
00:25:23.647,00:25:28.484,"Right after Hoffman injected Blake, he was incapacitated by our masked friend."
00:25:28.569,00:25:30.654,When Blake was still alive?
00:25:30.737,00:25:32.488,"And talking, according to Hoffman."
00:25:36.117,00:25:42.207,So we have no idea what the guy you had shot might have said to the whack job you had framed for it?
00:25:43.249,00:25:45.669,"-No, but there is an upside. -Mmm-hmm."
00:25:47.378,00:25:51.967,"Told everyone he was assaulted by the man in the mask, then he finished what he started with Blake."
00:25:52.050,00:25:53.927,So we're not exposed on that front.
00:25:54.010,00:25:57.222,"Well, let's have a parade."
00:25:57.305,00:25:59.975,"This guy, Hoffman, how much does he know?"
00:26:02.603,00:26:05.438,"Well, that fills me with warm comfort."
00:26:07.733,00:26:10.777,"Situation's being handled, all right."
00:26:17.743,00:26:19.202,"It's okay, honey."
00:26:21.788,00:26:23.790,-I'm not hungry. -You eat it.
00:26:23.874,00:26:25.500,It'll make you feel better.
00:26:26.877,00:26:29.963,"-Are you having some? -Sure, baby."
00:26:42.225,00:26:45.520,Do you think it's true? What Bernie said?
00:26:47.605,00:26:48.732,You can't listen to people like that.
00:26:48.815,00:26:51.401,You have to just block them out.
00:26:53.862,00:26:55.071,The hell happened to you?
00:26:55.155,00:26:56.948,"It's all right, I've got this."
00:26:58.742,00:27:00.493,You feed him too much of that shit.
00:27:00.576,00:27:03.079,You want him to get fatter than he already is?
00:27:06.624,00:27:08.334,-It was that Bernie Walker kid-- -Am I asking you?
00:27:11.129,00:27:12.673,What did he do?
00:27:13.715,00:27:15.133,He was knocking your signs down.
00:27:16.509,00:27:18.053,"I told him to stop, but he wouldn't."
00:27:18.970,00:27:22.015,He said I was a loser... just like my dad.
00:27:25.560,00:27:26.561,Get your coat.
00:27:28.646,00:27:30.565,Get your coat!
00:27:45.038,00:27:46.289,That him?
00:27:50.210,00:27:52.337,You been knocking down my signs?
00:27:52.420,00:27:54.380,"Yeah, so? Election's over."
00:27:54.464,00:27:57.092,"Doesn't give you the right to destroy other people's property, does it?"
00:27:58.969,00:28:01.179,"Oh, you're not running your mouth now, huh?"
00:28:01.262,00:28:03.306,My boy said you had plenty to say to him.
00:28:04.725,00:28:06.434,I put myself out there.
00:28:12.107,00:28:13.984,"You wanna call me a loser to my face, you little shit?"
00:28:14.067,00:28:15.819,"I didn't call you a loser, man."
00:28:15.902,00:28:17.738,"Oh, my boy's a liar now, huh?"
00:28:17.821,00:28:19.155,"He say it, or not?"
00:28:19.239,00:28:21.657,-Speak up when I'm talking to you. -He said it.
00:28:21.742,00:28:24.494,"No, I didn't. My dad did."
00:28:24.577,00:28:25.661,I was just repeating it.
00:28:28.289,00:28:29.415,You think that's funny?
00:28:30.708,00:28:32.878,Huh? What a man tries to do?
00:28:32.961,00:28:36.047,"-How he puts himself out there? -Whatever, man, Jesus."
00:28:36.131,00:28:38.759,"Hey! Hey, I'm talking to you."
00:28:45.181,00:28:46.975,Say something funny! Go ahead!
00:28:47.058,00:28:48.059,"Dad, stop!"
00:28:52.063,00:28:53.606,-Come here. -Dad...
00:28:53.689,00:28:55.608,Come here. Come here.
00:28:57.527,00:28:58.945,Come here.
00:29:00.030,00:29:02.741,It's people like this that wanna keep you down.
00:29:02.824,00:29:04.826,Keep you afraid.
00:29:04.910,00:29:07.620,You have to show 'em that that can never happen.
00:29:07.703,00:29:10.415,You gotta show 'em that you're a man.
00:29:11.082,00:29:12.083,Kick him.
00:29:12.167,00:29:16.379,Don't give me that look like your mother. You do what I tell you. Kick him.
00:29:17.297,00:29:18.464,Kick him!
00:29:23.804,00:29:25.263,Kick him!
00:29:26.181,00:29:28.724,Keep kicking him! Kick him!
00:29:30.518,00:29:33.814,Kick him! Kick him!
00:29:34.815,00:29:35.816,Harder!
00:30:36.835,00:30:37.836,Yes?
00:30:37.919,00:30:42.007,Gao reached out. She'd like a word.
00:30:42.090,00:30:44.550,-Send the car around. -She's coming to you.
00:30:44.634,00:30:46.219,Now.
00:30:49.472,00:30:51.933,Can you be here before she arrives?
00:30:52.017,00:30:54.352,I'm already on my way.
00:30:54.435,00:30:56.312,"Thank you, Wesley."
00:31:12.871,00:31:16.541,I picked it up on my last visit to your country.
00:31:18.293,00:31:20.336,I thought you might enjoy it.
00:31:30.805,00:31:33.558,He does not need you to form my words.
00:31:33.641,00:31:34.935,"Do you, Wilson?"
00:31:36.477,00:31:37.770,You speak English.
00:31:37.853,00:31:40.273,I speak many languages.
00:31:44.986,00:31:46.196,All of them.
00:32:33.159,00:32:34.244,Wait outside.
00:35:03.101,00:35:04.435,Get out.
00:35:06.812,00:35:24.414,"Sir, if there's anything I can bring-- Think of the man you wanna be."
00:35:25.540,00:35:30.670,You sit here and you stare at that wall and you think about that.
00:35:30.753,00:35:32.046,You're my son.
00:35:32.130,00:35:35.633,"You should be a king, not some fat little pussy."
00:35:37.677,00:35:38.803,Sit.
00:35:41.931,00:35:44.058,"What'd I say? Don't look at me, look at the wall."
00:35:46.394,00:35:49.063,Don't take your eyes off till I get back.
00:35:52.275,00:35:54.068,"I gotta take care of something, what's it matter?"
00:35:54.152,00:35:55.736,Can't it wait till tomorrow?
00:35:55.820,00:35:58.614,"No, Marlene, it can't, all right?"
00:36:09.500,00:36:11.544,-How much? -I got it covered.
00:36:11.627,00:36:12.628,That's all you need to know.
00:36:13.504,00:36:15.965,"You know, I told you, you shouldn't have borrowed money from him."
00:36:16.048,00:36:18.259,"But no, you had to be the big shot, huh?"
00:36:21.387,00:36:23.973,It's not enough I get that shit out there?
00:36:24.056,00:36:27.477,I gotta get it in my own house? In my own house?
00:36:32.482,00:36:35.067,"-Shut up! Shut up! -No, please! No!"
00:36:36.236,00:36:37.695,Shut up!
00:36:54.212,00:36:57.006,"No, I just thought you might need something."
00:36:57.089,00:36:59.425,"If I needed you, I would've asked."
00:37:01.302,00:37:03.638,"I don't think that's always true, sir."
00:37:23.866,00:37:27.578,We'll be all right. Thank you.
00:37:35.378,00:37:36.671,I like your place.
00:37:37.422,00:37:39.840,Not sure about the table.
00:37:43.594,00:37:45.555,If that's what you really want.
00:37:51.226,00:37:55.315,He's worried about you... your friend.
00:37:55.398,00:37:56.982,"Ah, he shouldn't be."
00:37:58.693,00:38:00.486,You made a promise...
00:38:01.404,00:38:04.156,to always be honest with me.
00:38:05.074,00:38:06.659,What is it?
00:38:11.706,00:38:13.165,I'm afraid.
00:38:13.248,00:38:15.042,Of what?
00:38:16.210,00:38:18.212,The way you'd look at me if you knew.
00:38:30.600,00:38:32.310,Tell me.
00:38:39.984,00:38:41.611,-Because of this family. -No!
00:38:43.278,00:38:45.948,They see you and that little bastard and they laugh!
00:38:49.243,00:38:51.621,-And you see what happens? -No!
00:38:51.704,00:38:53.498,-You see what happens? -No!
00:39:01.005,00:39:02.047,Stop it!
00:39:07.720,00:39:10.264,"What are you gonna do with that, fatty? Huh?"
00:39:11.223,00:39:12.475,Huh?
00:39:14.560,00:39:16.396,That's what I thought.
00:39:17.688,00:39:20.107,You believe this kid? He gets that shit from you.
00:39:29.450,00:39:31.243,"Oh, God."
00:39:42.380,00:39:44.799,Keep kicking him!
00:39:53.140,00:39:55.059,-It's okay. -Mommy.
00:39:58.062,00:40:02.149,"It's all right. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, baby."
00:40:08.113,00:40:10.074,Okay.
00:40:15.413,00:40:16.539,Get the saw.
00:41:09.258,00:41:13.804,We carried him in bags down to the river.
00:41:13.888,00:41:17.307,"One every night, for the next week."
00:41:19.226,00:41:21.729,Everyone in town knew that he owed money to Rigoletto.
00:41:21.812,00:41:24.273,"So, I guess they thought that..."
00:41:24.356,00:41:26.526,he'd left town to avoid him.
00:41:28.360,00:41:33.491,"My mother, she sent me to live with relatives on the farm that I told you about."
00:41:35.367,00:41:36.827,It wasn't your fault.
00:41:38.788,00:41:40.831,You were protecting your mother.
00:41:42.166,00:41:45.377,I didn't do it for her. I did it for me.
00:41:49.715,00:41:53.218,To remind myself that I'm not cruel for the sake of cruelty!
00:41:53.302,00:41:55.095,That I'm not my father!
00:41:55.179,00:41:57.389,That I'm not a monster!
00:41:59.642,00:42:00.726,Am I?
00:42:02.603,00:42:04.814,"No, Wilson."
00:42:05.856,00:42:07.232,You aren't.
00:42:18.661,00:42:21.496,But soon it won't matter.
00:42:27.670,00:42:30.089,They don't understand what I'm trying to do for this city.
00:42:30.172,00:42:33.551,They want to drag my name through the streets!
00:42:40.558,00:42:42.727,And are you going to let them?
00:42:47.815,00:42:49.066,No.
00:42:54.238,00:43:03.998,"It was a total bust. No, I-- Ellison. Ellison, no-- He's a crazy old man in a tinfoil hat."
00:43:05.750,00:43:09.503,And why are we chasing a story like this anyway?
00:43:09.587,00:43:11.005,What?
00:43:12.381,00:43:13.841,Shit.
00:43:13.924,00:43:16.551,"Look, can I call you back? I'm drowning out here."
00:43:16.636,00:43:18.512,"Yes, yes, okay. Fine."
00:43:29.564,00:43:31.984,We need to talk.
00:43:35.988,00:43:37.615,Do you know who I am?
00:43:43.788,00:43:45.080,The Devil of Hell's Kitchen.
00:43:45.164,00:43:46.832,Do you believe that?
00:43:47.750,00:43:49.376,What they're saying about me?
00:43:49.459,00:43:52.713,You've been in an awful lot of wrong places at the wrong time lately.
00:43:52.797,00:43:54.924,But I've heard the other stories.
00:43:55.007,00:43:58.177,"About the man in the mask, helping people."
00:43:59.594,00:44:01.722,Sounds like maybe there's more than one side to you.
00:44:05.600,00:44:07.394,And I didn't shoot those cops.
00:44:09.438,00:44:11.065,You want me to write your side of this?
00:44:11.148,00:44:14.652,"No, I want you to expose the man responsible."
00:44:18.447,00:44:20.490,You got a name?
00:44:20.574,00:44:21.659,Wilson Fisk.
00:44:22.702,00:44:25.120,-Never heard of him. -Because he doesn't want you to.
00:44:25.204,00:44:26.288,That's what makes him dangerous.
00:44:26.371,00:44:27.957,"Living in the shadows, no one knowing who he is."
00:44:29.458,00:44:30.876,Said the man in the mask.
00:44:32.920,00:44:36.048,-I'm trying to protect this city. -Maybe.
00:44:36.131,00:44:39.969,But right now they hate you. And have no idea who this Fisk guy is.
00:44:40.052,00:44:41.929,You can change that.
00:44:42.012,00:44:43.723,So could 100 other reporters.
00:44:43.806,00:44:45.224,Why me?
00:44:45.307,00:44:47.642,"There are good people who trust you, Ben."
00:44:48.686,00:44:50.062,I have faith in their judgment.
00:44:52.106,00:44:53.941,Union Allied.
00:44:56.193,00:45:00.155,Guessing that was you who dumped that guy on the doorsteps of the Bulletin?
00:45:00.239,00:45:02.199,I think he's connected to Fisk.
00:45:02.282,00:45:03.743,That woman you saved that night?
00:45:03.826,00:45:05.535,She's a good kid.
00:45:07.037,00:45:10.750,"Still believes you're a hero, despite what everybody's saying."
00:45:10.833,00:45:12.292,People like her are why I do this.
00:45:14.169,00:45:16.296,If I do the smart thing and say no?
00:45:18.340,00:45:20.050,Then I'll have to stop him some other way.
00:45:20.843,00:45:22.219,That has a ring of finality to it.
00:45:22.302,00:45:23.637,I'm not a killer.
00:45:24.679,00:45:26.181,I keep telling people that.
00:45:37.526,00:45:38.527,What do you got?
00:45:38.610,00:45:40.404,Bits and pieces.
00:45:40.487,00:45:42.364,Russians... Triads... Yakuza...
00:45:42.447,00:45:45.200,all funneling money through a man named Leland Owlsley.
00:45:45.284,00:45:48.328,The Wall Street guy? How'd you get all this?
00:45:49.579,00:45:50.664,How do you think?
00:45:54.960,00:45:57.254,-I can't print that without credible-- -Detective Blake...
00:45:57.337,00:45:59.339,I was at the hospital when he died.
00:45:59.423,00:46:01.926,"Yeah, they're saying you sent him on his way."
00:46:03.260,00:46:06.889,"It was his partner, Hoffman. They both worked for Fisk."
00:46:06.972,00:46:09.934,"Blake gave Fisk up, before he went."
00:46:10.017,00:46:11.351,You get this on tape?
00:46:12.269,00:46:15.856,Somebody else in the room to corroborate what he said?
00:46:19.109,00:46:20.861,I need reliable sources.
00:46:20.945,00:46:24.031,"A bunch of he said, she said is not gonna put this guy away."
00:46:24.114,00:46:27.451,We don't need to put him away. Just drag him into the light.
00:46:27.534,00:46:28.618,Give him nowhere to hide.
00:46:28.702,00:46:31.080,Once the city knows who he is...
00:46:31.163,00:46:32.873,they'll tear him apart.
00:46:36.168,00:46:39.713,And this is the guy at the top. You sure about that?
00:46:39.796,00:46:41.673,I'd bet my life on it.
00:46:43.050,00:46:45.469,"You're betting mine now, too."
00:47:28.470,00:47:29.721,It's an old saying.
00:47:29.804,00:47:32.432,"One that survived the years, because it's true."
00:47:32.516,00:47:33.558,For the most part.
00:47:33.642,00:47:35.936,But not for everyone.
00:47:36.020,00:47:38.855,Some get more than they deserve.
00:47:38.939,00:47:42.276,Because they believe they aren't like everyone else.
00:47:42.359,00:47:51.952,"That the rules, the ones people like me and you, the people that work and struggle to live our lives, just live, don't apply to them."
00:47:58.959,00:48:00.961,They do this from the shadows.
00:48:01.045,00:48:03.172,Shadows that we cast.
00:48:03.255,00:48:05.674,With our indifference.
00:48:05.757,00:48:12.347,"With a pervasive lack of interest in anything that doesn't directly affect us, we, in the here and now."
00:48:14.724,00:48:17.519,Or maybe it's just the shadow of weariness.
00:48:17.602,00:48:27.947,"Of how tired we are, struggling to claw our way back to a middle class that no longer exist, because of those who take more than they deserve."
00:48:28.030,00:48:40.084,"And they keep taking, until all that's left for the rest of us is a memory of how it used to be before the corporations and the bottom line decided we didn't matter anymore."
00:48:41.418,00:48:42.461,But we do.
00:48:43.378,00:48:47.549,"You and I, the people of this city..."
00:48:47.632,00:48:50.094,we still matter.
00:48:51.470,00:48:54.974,There's someone in Hell's Kitchen that doesn't share this belief.
00:48:55.057,00:48:57.977,He's been among us for quite some time.
00:48:58.060,00:49:01.438,You've never heard his name. You've never seen his face.
00:49:01.521,00:49:02.982,He's stayed in the shadows.
00:49:03.065,00:49:11.448,"Because men like him, men that want to control our city, our lives, fear the light and what it reveals."
00:49:11.531,00:49:16.245,This man must no longer be allowed to operate in the darkness.
00:49:16.328,00:49:20.915,"If he has nothing to hide, let him step forward."
00:49:26.838,00:49:32.094,But I felt the need to speak up for this city that I love with all my heart.
00:49:33.012,00:49:35.264,No one should have to live in fear.
00:49:40.810,00:49:43.313,who have no regard for who they injure.
00:49:43.397,00:49:49.153,"In fear of the Devil of Hell's Kitchen, who has inflicted untold pain and suffering."
00:49:50.070,00:50:03.208,"This masked terrorist and psychopaths of his kind, we must show them we will not bow down to their campaign of coercion and intimidation."
00:50:04.209,00:50:06.920,We must stand up to them.
00:50:07.003,00:50:15.804,"As this man, my dearest friend, Leland Owlsley, a pillar in the financial community, stood up when he was recently assaulted."
00:50:15.887,00:50:19.766,But this assault was for no other reason than to send me a message.
00:50:19.849,00:50:22.686,A message warning me to stop.
00:50:22.769,00:50:25.730,To give up my dream that I have for this city.
00:50:25.814,00:50:28.233,A dream of a better place.
00:50:29.401,00:50:33.238,A place for its citizens to feel safe.
00:50:33.322,00:50:35.782,To feel pride.
00:50:35.865,00:50:40.079,"I tried to do this quietly, not wanting to draw attention."
00:50:40.162,00:50:47.502,The last thing I wanted was for anyone close to me to become a target from those who do not share my dream.
00:50:47.586,00:50:55.677,"For those who will have this city stay exactly as it is, mired in poverty and crime."
00:50:55.760,00:50:59.098,But I know now it was foolish to make that decision.
00:50:59.181,00:51:02.016,That I can no longer do it alone.
00:51:02.101,00:51:05.437,That I cannot keep living in the shadows...
00:51:06.521,00:51:08.482,afraid of the light.
00:51:08.565,00:51:12.277,None of us can. None of us should be forced to.
00:51:13.237,00:51:15.697,We must do this together.
00:51:16.698,00:51:20.702,We must resist those who would have us live in fear.
00:51:25.332,00:51:26.833,My name...
00:51:28.543,00:51:30.420,is Wilson Fisk.
00:51:30.504,00:51:35.384,"And together, we can make this city a better place."
00:01:14.616,00:01:15.617,Ahh!
00:01:25.877,00:01:26.878,Ahhh!
00:02:54.216,00:02:57.219,Started to wonder if you'd ever turn up again.
00:03:01.681,00:03:03.099,-been busy. -Hmm.
00:03:11.483,00:03:12.609,"Uh, Father?"
00:03:18.990,00:03:21.743,I was wondering if I could take you up on that latte?
00:03:47.894,00:03:49.186,Sugar?
00:03:50.187,00:03:51.231,No.
00:04:01.408,00:04:03.618,"what's on your mind, Matthew?"
00:04:06.162,00:04:08.373,Wasn't that hard to find out.
00:04:09.624,00:04:14.296,People still remember Battlin' Jack Murdock around these parts...
00:04:14.379,00:04:16.589,and what happened to his son.
00:04:19.342,00:04:23.179,"Seal of confession still applies, even over lattes."
00:04:23.263,00:04:25.014,That what you're worried about.
00:04:27.850,00:04:30.227,"Do you believe in the Devil, Father?"
00:04:32.772,00:04:35.858,You mean... as a concept?
00:04:35.942,00:04:36.943,No.
00:04:42.239,00:04:44.576,"In this world, among us."
00:04:45.493,00:04:47.787,You want the short answer or the long one?
00:04:48.913,00:04:50.457,Just the truth.
00:04:55.753,00:04:57.672,When I was in seminary...
00:04:58.798,00:05:01.884,"I was more studious than pious, more..."
00:05:01.968,00:05:05.847,skeptical than most of my peers.
00:05:05.930,00:05:07.932,I had this notion...
00:05:08.015,00:05:13.771,"which I was more than willing to speak about, at length, to whoever I could corner..."
00:05:13.855,00:05:16.190,that the Devil...
00:05:16.273,00:05:17.609,was inconsequential.
00:05:18.651,00:05:21.028,Minor figure in the grand scheme.
00:05:22.905,00:05:24.073,Not very Catholic of you.
00:05:24.156,00:05:25.575,"Uh-huh, yeah."
00:05:25.658,00:05:33.666,"In my defense, in the scriptures, the Hebrew word Satan actually means adversary."
00:05:33.750,00:05:37.294,It's applied to any antagonist.
00:05:37.379,00:05:41.090,"Angels and humans, serpents and kings."
00:05:41.173,00:05:47.430,Medieval theologians reinterpreted those passages to be about a single monstrous enemy.
00:05:48.765,00:05:53.060,"And, in my youthful zeal, I was certain I knew why..."
00:05:53.144,00:05:54.270,propaganda.
00:05:55.605,00:05:58.650,Played up to drive people into the church.
00:05:58.733,00:06:00.151,So you don't believe he exists.
00:06:00.234,00:06:01.944,Am I done talking?
00:06:03.613,00:06:05.448,Sorry.
00:06:05.532,00:06:09.160,"Years later, I was in Rwanda..."
00:06:09.243,00:06:14.081,trying to help local churches provide aid and sanctuary to refugees.
00:06:15.708,00:06:21.297,"I'd become close with the village elder, Gahiji."
00:06:21.380,00:06:26.385,"He and his family had the respect of everybody, Hutu and Tutsi alike."
00:06:26.469,00:06:30.932,"He'd helped them all... through famines, disease."
00:06:33.976,00:06:38.606,The militia liked to force Hutu villagers to murder their neighbors...
00:06:40.858,00:06:41.943,with machetes.
00:06:43.152,00:06:46.614,But nobody would raise a hand against Gahiji.
00:06:46.698,00:06:50.743,"They said, Well... how can we kill such a holy man?"
00:06:52.537,00:06:55.164,So the militia commander sent soldiers...
00:06:56.583,00:06:58.000,with orders to cut his head off...
00:06:59.502,00:07:01.796,in front of the entire village.
00:07:03.631,00:07:05.717,Gahiji didn't try to put up a fight.
00:07:06.968,00:07:09.971,Just asked for the chance to say goodbye to his family.
00:07:11.263,00:07:15.435,"By the time he was done, even the soldiers didn't wanna kill him."
00:07:15.518,00:07:18.521,So they went to their commander and asked permission to shoot him.
00:07:20.064,00:07:21.398,At least give him a quick death.
00:07:23.943,00:07:27.614,The commander wanted to meet this man...
00:07:33.035,00:07:34.704,He went to Gahiji...
00:07:43.838,00:07:47.842,Then he dragged him out in front of his village and hacked him to pieces...
00:07:50.595,00:07:52.555,along with his entire family.
00:07:57.059,00:07:59.896,In that man who took Gahiji's life...
00:08:01.105,00:08:02.690,I saw the Devil.
00:08:04.233,00:08:07.529,"So yes, Matthew..."
00:08:14.201,00:08:15.870,taking many forms.
00:08:20.082,00:08:22.168,What if you could have stopped him...
00:08:23.920,00:08:26.088,from ever hurting anyone again?
00:08:27.048,00:08:29.341,Stopped him how?
00:08:32.469,00:08:34.806,"This doesn't change anything, Ben."
00:08:34.889,00:08:37.892,Except now we know who your king of diamonds is.
00:08:37.975,00:08:40.770,You see the news? Everything's changed.
00:08:44.649,00:08:47.652,Fisk has gotten out in front of being dragged into the spotlight.
00:08:47.735,00:08:51.238,"My editor thinks he's the Second Coming. Hell, the whole city does."
00:08:53.950,00:09:00.164,Internet went from nothing on Fisk to filled with three-hanky stories about a poor little fat kid from Hell's Kitchen.
00:09:00.247,00:09:03.167,Abandoned by his father when he was 12. Mother died a year later.
00:09:03.250,00:09:07.088,Now look at him. Boot straps and a big dream.
00:09:07.171,00:09:08.756,Somebody knows something.
00:09:08.840,00:09:11.968,It's just a matter of asking the right people the right questions in the right tone of voice.
00:09:12.051,00:09:14.971,"Yeah, that's how you get yourself hurt."
00:09:16.723,00:09:19.016,That's what I keep telling them.
00:09:19.100,00:09:20.768,Maybe they'll listen to you.
00:09:20.852,00:09:24.438,"Ben Urich, Matt Murdock. Attorney at Why the Hell Bother."
00:09:26.774,00:09:29.360,-Mr. Murdock. -Matt.
00:09:29.443,00:09:32.614,My partner thinks we should be pursuing this through the legal system.
00:09:32.697,00:09:33.698,A lot safer that way.
00:09:33.781,00:09:35.742,"Well, why don't we all just crawl under the covers, then?"
00:09:35.825,00:09:40.496,"-No, Karen... -Well, I'm sorry, but if Fisk is really behind everything that has happened, then we need to do something."
00:09:44.166,00:09:46.460,Friend of yours came to see me the other night...
00:09:51.048,00:09:53.550,"I could say I'm Captain America, but it doesn't put wings on my head."
00:09:58.598,00:10:01.433,I printed this from a thumb drive he gave me.
00:10:03.728,00:10:04.771,"Oh, my God!"
00:10:08.524,00:10:10.026,said he owns half the police...
00:10:10.109,00:10:11.986,that they helped him take down the Russians.
00:10:19.285,00:10:22.789,"He could just be throwing smoke. I mean, he just killed Detective Blake."
00:10:22.872,00:10:25.833,"Said Blake's partner Hoffman did it, probably on Fisk's orders."
00:10:25.917,00:10:27.919,"But yeah, it occurred to me."
00:10:28.836,00:10:30.254,You could talk to Hoffman.
00:10:30.337,00:10:32.131,Tried. He's in the wind.
00:10:32.214,00:10:34.425,Or bottom of the river. Either way...
00:10:36.093,00:10:37.762,He just shrugged.
00:10:37.845,00:10:38.971,Sorry.
00:10:39.055,00:10:41.808,"Wait, what about the Union Allied money?"
00:10:41.891,00:10:44.435,Is there a way that we can tie it directly to Fisk?
00:10:45.853,00:10:49.941,"According to the Mask, a man named, uh, Leland Owlsley runs the books."
00:10:50.024,00:10:54.236,"But since getting roughed up by him, Owlsley's been surrounded by Fisk's security."
00:10:54.320,00:10:55.362,Can't get anywhere near him.
00:10:55.446,00:11:00.910,"Same goes with, uh, James Wesley, the guy you said hired you to defend Healy."
00:11:00.993,00:11:03.370,"Look, the Mask came to Ben for help."
00:11:03.454,00:11:08.000,"And I don't care how rich Fisk is, nobody can totally erase their past."
00:11:08.084,00:11:13.505,"I mean, somewhere out there, there has to be a piece of paper, a witness..."
00:11:17.760,00:11:21.931,The suit that hired us to defend Healy standing right next to Fisk when he gave his big speech.
00:11:22.014,00:11:28.104,"I looked into that. According to FCC filings, Confed Global's where Fisk gets most of his reported income."
00:11:28.187,00:11:29.814,"All right, let's play this out."
00:11:29.897,00:11:38.405,"If Fisk is connected to Confed Global, that means he's involved in Westmeyer-Holt Contracting, which-- Westmeyer-Holt is strong-arming tenants out of their rent-controlled apartments."
00:11:38.489,00:11:40.407,"Um, they were hired by a guy named Armand Tully."
00:11:40.491,00:11:41.492,The slumlord?
00:11:41.575,00:11:47.123,"Landman and Zack say he's on vacation on an island that no one can pronounce, where they use coconuts as phones."
00:11:48.040,00:11:49.876,Another connection in the wind.
00:11:49.959,00:11:52.754,Westmeyer-Holt to Confed to Fisk.
00:11:52.837,00:11:54.505,"We pull that thread, see what it unravels."
00:11:58.592,00:12:01.303,I'll take the Devil of Hell's Kitchen over Fisk any day.
00:12:01.387,00:12:03.514,"Plus, he kicks ass."
00:12:03.597,00:12:06.642,"No, you should've seen the way that he was flipping around in the rain."
00:12:08.685,00:12:10.521,Why not just take Fisk down himself?
00:12:11.563,00:12:15.026,Maybe he knows there's some roads you can't come back from.
00:12:25.828,00:12:28.915,"across political, ethnic and economic lines."
00:12:33.169,00:12:39.633,"so the PAC is actively making donations, and Senator Cherryh's office has asked for a meet."
00:12:43.179,00:12:45.848,Reject the first place they suggest.
00:12:52.855,00:12:59.361,Our sources in IAB tell me he was supposed to give a follow-up statement about what happened at Metro-General.
00:12:59.445,00:13:01.072,He never showed.
00:13:02.573,00:13:04.075,We need to put this behind us.
00:13:04.158,00:13:06.035,"If he's still in the city, we'll find him."
00:13:06.118,00:13:07.203,If he isn't?
00:13:09.371,00:13:12.208,We'll still find him. It might just take a little longer.
00:13:15.002,00:13:16.838,And the man in the mask?
00:13:18.005,00:13:20.842,The authorities are motivated to shoot on sight...
00:13:20.925,00:13:21.968,if they have the opportunity.
00:13:22.051,00:13:25.429,He's not nearly as active as he has been in the past.
00:13:27.098,00:13:28.307,Maybe he's given up.
00:13:28.390,00:13:32.269,Maybe he's just choosing his targets more carefully.
00:13:34.480,00:13:36.732,"Hey, I said you need to wait outside."
00:14:00.339,00:14:03.217,Misspeak my words again...
00:14:03.300,00:14:04.676,and I will have your tongue.
00:14:06.803,00:14:10.474,The time for pleasantries... is at an end.
00:14:10.557,00:14:17.606,I was promised a city block in return for my aid in your ventures.
00:14:21.693,00:14:23.154,There is a...
00:14:25.447,00:14:30.161,"a tenement in, um... this particular area..."
00:14:31.537,00:14:35.374,it has proven troublesome to vacate.
00:14:36.500,00:14:46.843,But we have other blocks coming up if you-- I don't recall...
00:14:48.304,00:14:50.597,guaranteeing a specific block.
00:14:52.099,00:14:55.227,You'll need to be patient...
00:14:55.311,00:14:57.354,or choose another.
00:14:58.814,00:15:02.985,I am bound by certain requirements.
00:15:03.069,00:15:06.405,Even I have those I must answer to.
00:15:06.488,00:15:10.952,After the setback at the docks...
00:15:11.035,00:15:13.913,I can afford no further disruptions.
00:15:13.996,00:15:17.208,"Do what you must, but do it quickly."
00:15:18.209,00:15:19.210,Wesley?
00:15:19.293,00:15:24.590,"Regardless of how carefully it's handled, you're now the owner of record."
00:15:24.673,00:15:28.552,The negative publicity could prove costly.
00:15:32.181,00:15:35.892,"Well, the offer's appreciated, but unnecessary."
00:15:35.977,00:15:42.691,"There is, however, a problem that you could aid me in solving, in return for my help."
00:15:43.900,00:15:46.445,One that has inconvenienced us both.
00:15:47.738,00:15:49.448,The man in black.
00:15:50.907,00:15:54.536,He's proven to be more difficult to address than expected.
00:15:57.289,00:16:01.085,Possessed of determination and unusual talents.
00:16:05.297,00:16:08.009,We must match him in kind.
00:16:08.092,00:16:13.222,"A specialist, perhaps, from your organization."
00:16:13.305,00:16:15.599,I know of one with such skills.
00:16:17.143,00:16:19.478,But finding our enemy will be difficult.
00:16:19.561,00:16:22.273,He has become... cautious.
00:16:22.356,00:16:23.983,"Yes, he has."
00:16:28.529,00:16:29.905,But emotion...
00:16:32.158,00:16:37.621,can turn the most circumspect of men careless.
00:16:48.340,00:16:55.972,"Hey, if Fisk really is the guy that blew the hell out of my city, shot those cops and went after you, then nobody wants to see him take it on the nuts more than me."
00:16:56.057,00:16:57.308,"No, I might have you edged out on that."
00:16:57.391,00:16:59.893,"Okay, present company excluded."
00:16:59.976,00:17:03.272,All I'm saying is Armand Tully is a dead end.
00:17:04.565,00:17:08.235,"I, um, did a little back-channeling with Marci."
00:17:08.319,00:17:10.362,"Okay, ew, just-- What did you get?"
00:17:10.446,00:17:17.036,Tully really is on an island that he bought with the money that Confed Global is paying him for all his real estate holdings in Hell's Kitchen.
00:17:18.287,00:17:21.207,"I mean, it ties Fisk directly to what's happening in the tenement case."
00:17:21.290,00:17:22.541,"No, it doesn't."
00:17:22.624,00:17:24.751,"According to the records, the deal just went through this morning."
00:17:24.835,00:17:25.919,So...
00:17:28.672,00:17:31.300,was before Fisk was the owner on record. All falls on Tully.
00:17:31.383,00:17:35.304,"Okay, so we go after Tully. We get him to turn on Fisk."
00:17:35.387,00:17:37.473,"Yeah, that island he's on?"
00:17:40.184,00:17:41.810,It's another dead end.
00:18:11.632,00:18:13.592,Her neighbors are thinking about taking it.
00:18:13.675,00:18:14.843,Maybe they should.
00:18:41.828,00:18:43.622,Enough of them maybe to make a difference.
00:18:43.705,00:18:47.042,I no take! This my home.
00:18:47.126,00:18:48.544,"We fight, yes?"
00:18:48.627,00:18:50.837,"Yes, sí."
00:18:52.131,00:18:53.424,He is good man.
00:18:54.090,00:18:55.592,All of you...
00:18:55.676,00:18:56.677,good.
00:19:04.226,00:19:05.477,You shouldn't have done that.
00:19:05.561,00:19:07.563,"What? Fight for the rights of the little guy, right?"
00:19:07.646,00:19:10.732,"Fisk wants the tenements, he's not gonna stop until he gets them."
00:19:10.816,00:19:12.651,"Well, so what? We're just supposed to roll over?"
00:19:12.734,00:19:14.320,Fisk is public on this.
00:19:14.403,00:19:20.867,"If we tie him up with an injunction, maybe we find something in the deposition that we-- Oh, come on, Foggy, you think we're gonna trip this guy up with a deposition?"
00:19:20.951,00:19:23.370,"After everything that's happened, you don't get who we're dealing with?"
00:19:23.454,00:19:24.455,"No, we get it!"
00:19:24.538,00:19:28.375,"Matt, he's a rich dickhead who thinks he can pay people off to kiss his ass."
00:19:29.626,00:19:34.423,"Look, he is standing on City Hall with his cronies like he's already won."
00:19:34.506,00:19:36.049,You know he can't see that.
00:19:36.132,00:19:37.801,"All right, we can't let him get away with this."
00:19:46.017,00:19:48.604,"Thank you, Sun Tzu. What does that actually mean?"
00:19:48.687,00:19:51.732,It means we keep digging.
00:19:51.815,00:19:57.529,"Like Karen said, somewhere out there, there's a piece of paper or a witness, or something that'll lead to the truth."
00:19:59.406,00:20:03.327,"But, do it quietly. Stay under the radar."
00:20:04.911,00:20:06.372,Where are you going?
00:20:06.455,00:20:08.874,Three people stood with Fisk when he addressed the city.
00:20:08.957,00:20:11.627,"His man from Confed Global, Owlsley and a woman."
00:20:11.710,00:20:13.670,One the press said he seemed close with.
00:20:13.754,00:20:16.590,"Oh, yeah, uh, Vanessa, um..."
00:20:16.673,00:20:19.385,Marianna. It says she works at Scene Contempo Gallery.
00:20:19.468,00:20:22.137,Maybe it's time I invested in some art.
00:20:29.436,00:20:30.437,Anyone else?
00:20:32.273,00:20:35.901,"He won't come, but he'll get pissy if he isn't invited."
00:20:57.381,00:20:59.675,"I hope so. Um, Matthew."
00:20:59.758,00:21:00.926,Vanessa.
00:21:01.009,00:21:02.844,Vanessa.
00:21:02.928,00:21:06.139,You're probably wondering what a man who can't see is doing in an art gallery.
00:21:07.349,00:21:08.934,I didn't want to be forward.
00:21:10.226,00:21:13.439,I'm told by my guests my apartment's a bit stark.
00:21:13.522,00:21:15.274,I thought maybe some art would warm it up.
00:21:16.066,00:21:20.529,I'm going to go out on a limb and assume these guests were women?
00:21:22.739,00:21:25.617,"Well, I'm not trying to impress the pizza guy."
00:21:30.539,00:21:32.583,-Sight helps. -Sure.
00:21:32.666,00:21:39.673,But there's something very intimate in experiencing art through someone else's eyes.
00:21:40.924,00:21:42.801,"That's a good line, by the way. You should use it."
00:21:44.345,00:21:47.806,"So, give me an idea what you're after."
00:21:47.889,00:21:49.391,I am not sure.
00:21:50.726,00:21:53.019,Good... art isn't furniture.
00:21:53.103,00:21:56.898,"If you knew exactly what you were looking for, you'd be just decorating."
00:21:56.982,00:22:00.486,Art should speak to you... move you.
00:22:00.569,00:22:02.404,"This one, for example."
00:22:04.239,00:22:06.282,One of my favorite pieces.
00:22:10.245,00:22:11.913,Describe it to me.
00:22:14.207,00:22:17.336,Imagine a sea of tonal reds.
00:22:18.379,00:22:21.297,The color of anger...
00:22:21.382,00:22:23.550,of rage...
00:22:23.634,00:22:26.177,but also the color of the heart...
00:22:26.261,00:22:29.681,of love... hope.
00:22:29.765,00:22:32.934,This strikes the perfect balance between the two.
00:22:35.145,00:22:37.188,"I don't know, it sounds aggressive."
00:22:38.649,00:22:40.567,All depends on your point of view.
00:22:44.613,00:22:46.239,"Tell me, do you have a man in your life?"
00:22:47.783,00:22:50.452,"Matthew, are you hitting on me?"
00:22:52.829,00:22:54.080,What does he respond to?
00:22:54.164,00:23:00.462,"If I can get inside the head of the man who won the heart of such a charming woman, it would inform my decision."
00:23:00.546,00:23:04.508,"Well, you could always ask him yourself."
00:23:28.323,00:23:29.491,I see.
00:23:30.576,00:23:33.537,"Wilson Fisk, Matthew..."
00:23:33.620,00:23:35.205,Murdock.
00:23:36.707,00:23:37.874,"Oh, yes, the attorney."
00:23:37.958,00:23:40.168,I've heard about all your work in Hell's Kitchen.
00:23:41.044,00:23:42.463,Ah.
00:23:45.674,00:23:48.051,Mr. Murdock is thinking of purchasing some art.
00:23:48.134,00:23:52.222,He was looking for some advice from a man of taste.
00:23:52.305,00:23:55.851,"Well, that's simple. Buy whatever the lady tells you."
00:23:58.854,00:24:00.438,Although we probably shouldn't be talking.
00:24:00.522,00:24:02.566,I believe we're on opposite sides of a tenancy case.
00:24:02.649,00:24:04.485,"-Oh, you are? -Yes."
00:24:05.819,00:24:08.614,The rental properties I recently acquired from Mr. Tully.
00:24:09.615,00:24:12.325,But I'm sure that will be settled to everyone's benefit.
00:24:12.408,00:24:15.746,The city has suffered long enough under the burden of poverty and decay.
00:24:16.705,00:24:23.712,"I believe we have opportunities now with-- Wilson, Mr. Murdock is a customer, not a donor."
00:24:25.463,00:24:27.674,"Yes, I apologize for the hard sell."
00:24:29.134,00:24:31.803,This city and its future...
00:24:31.887,00:24:35.891,Seeing Hell's Kitchen to its fullest potential is very important to me.
00:24:37.475,00:24:39.227,I feel the same way.
00:24:40.854,00:24:43.106,"Vanessa, thank you so much for your time."
00:24:43.189,00:24:47.819,Have you changed your mind about what you came for?
00:24:47.903,00:24:50.864,"No, no, I would just need to consider the cost."
00:24:51.990,00:24:53.116,Mr. Fisk.
00:25:28.151,00:25:31.446,I like to have a moment... end of the day...
00:25:32.823,00:25:34.490,just me and him.
00:25:37.703,00:25:40.080,Maybe you could put in a word.
00:25:40.956,00:25:44.668,"How did you know I was sitting here, you mind me asking?"
00:25:44.751,00:25:47.462,You want the short answer or the long one?
00:25:52.593,00:25:57.055,"I was worried you might've gone out and done something foolish, after our talk this morning."
00:26:01.101,00:26:02.603,Not yet.
00:26:02.686,00:26:05.563,Sounds a bit on the ominous side.
00:26:07.482,00:26:10.235,I went to visit someone close to the...
00:26:11.945,00:26:13.071,close to the Devil.
00:26:18.994,00:26:21.663,Of who he is and what it would take to...
00:26:23.874,00:26:25.000,do what I have to.
00:26:25.083,00:26:26.668,And...
00:26:28.461,00:26:30.088,what did you learn?
00:26:33.759,00:26:35.761,That he has someone he loves...
00:26:37.012,00:26:39.430,"who loves him, who'd mourn his loss."
00:26:45.729,00:26:47.939,Even Lucifer was once an angel.
00:26:48.023,00:26:51.818,It's why judgment and vengeance...
00:26:53.028,00:26:54.570,are best left to God.
00:26:55.613,00:26:57.949,Especially when murder is not in your heart.
00:26:59.993,00:27:02.370,"You're here, aren't you?"
00:27:07.208,00:27:08.293,Sorry.
00:27:19.012,00:27:21.682,I know my soul is damned if I take his life.
00:27:23.809,00:27:25.977,"But if I stand idle, if I..."
00:27:26.812,00:27:34.485,"If I let him consume this city, all the people that will suffer and die-- There is a wide gulf between inaction and murder, Matthew."
00:27:34.569,00:27:37.989,Another man's evil does not make you good.
00:27:43.119,00:27:46.957,So the question you have to ask yourself is...
00:27:47.958,00:27:52.253,are you struggling with the fact that you don't wanna kill this man...
00:27:54.422,00:27:57.175,Or that you don't have to kill him...
00:27:58.551,00:28:00.178,but want to?
00:28:02.472,00:28:09.312,Like a muddied spring or a polluted fountain is the righteous man who gives way before the wicked.
00:28:09.395,00:28:12.607,"Proverbs 25-something, I never can remember."
00:28:12.690,00:28:15.026,Meaning righteous men have a duty to stand up to evil.
00:28:15.110,00:28:17.528,One interpretation.
00:28:17.612,00:28:25.787,"Another is that when the righteous succumb to sin, it is as harmful as if the public well were poisoned."
00:28:26.537,00:28:31.709,Because the darkness of such an act... of taking a life...
00:28:31.793,00:28:37.007,"will spread to friends, neighbors..."
00:28:38.800,00:28:40.593,the entire community.
00:28:44.680,00:28:46.016,What if it already has?
00:28:46.099,00:28:48.226,"Then we wouldn't be sitting here, would we?"
00:28:52.688,00:28:58.361,I don't believe you went to see this woman for insight into how to kill a man.
00:29:00.196,00:29:01.531,I think...
00:29:02.741,00:29:06.452,maybe you went looking for a reason not to.
00:29:18.506,00:29:19.507,Hey!
00:29:20.425,00:29:21.509,Hey.
00:29:21.592,00:29:25.013,"Uh, Foggy, um, tried to get a hold of you last night."
00:29:25.096,00:29:27.140,"Oh, yeah, turned off my phone."
00:29:29.768,00:29:30.811,You okay?
00:29:34.647,00:29:38.651,"How did it go with that, um... Vanessa woman?"
00:29:38.734,00:29:40.445,"Oh, I didn't get what I needed."
00:29:41.196,00:29:42.864,Oh.
00:29:42.948,00:29:44.783,"Well, uh, Foggy and I had better luck."
00:29:44.866,00:29:49.120,"Um, we identified the assholes that jumped us outside of Elena's."
00:29:49.204,00:29:51.372,It's a Stewart Schmidt and Joseph Pike.
00:29:51.456,00:29:56.002,"-You ID'd them from booking photos? -No, actually-- Contractor's licenses."
00:29:58.671,00:30:00.173,"Walking, clearing my head."
00:30:00.256,00:30:02.467,"Hate when you don't answer my calls, buddy."
00:30:02.550,00:30:04.635,I always think you fell down an open manhole or something.
00:30:06.888,00:30:11.226,"Westmeyer-Holt Contracting, another wonderful Global Confed subsidiary."
00:30:11.309,00:30:12.518,"Well, that's it. That's great."
00:30:12.602,00:30:16.022,"We press assault charges, get them to flip on Fisk."
00:30:16.106,00:30:17.232,"Yeah, not so much."
00:30:17.315,00:30:20.276,I reached out to Ben and his sources say that they're off the map.
00:30:20.360,00:30:22.570,Just like Hoffman and Tully.
00:30:22.653,00:30:23.864,Of course they are.
00:30:26.825,00:30:30.370,"I wouldn't go that far. Here, Foggy, show him the thing."
00:30:39.129,00:30:44.092,"It's just like the one I drew on the napkin that you, uh, couldn't see back when."
00:30:48.763,00:30:49.931,Building regulations.
00:30:50.015,00:30:53.143,"Anyway, so are we. We are small but awesome."
00:30:53.226,00:30:54.895,And we're gonna make a difference.
00:30:54.978,00:30:56.897,I know it doesn't feel like it sometimes...
00:30:56.980,00:31:00.191,"a lot of the time, but we are, with the power of the law."
00:31:00.275,00:31:02.068,Okay.
00:31:02.152,00:31:04.820,"Dragged me into this rinky-dink firm, Murdock..."
00:31:09.284,00:31:11.036,You're not gonna kiss me.
00:31:16.457,00:31:18.126,"Nelson and Murdock, how may I help you?"
00:31:27.677,00:31:28.678,Um...
00:31:30.889,00:31:32.098,"Uh, when?"
00:31:42.317,00:31:43.985,It's her.
00:31:47.906,00:31:49.574,How did it happen?
00:31:53.869,00:31:56.331,fleeing the scene with her purse.
00:31:56.414,00:31:58.917,Probably jumped her while she was fishing for her keys.
00:32:02.128,00:32:03.838,"Karen, maybe you should wait outside."
00:32:11.012,00:32:12.138,How did she die?
00:32:14.849,00:32:16.601,Multiple stab wounds.
00:32:17.852,00:32:20.396,"The ambulance got there quick, but..."
00:32:22.857,00:32:27.028,My mom says all the family she knew about's passed on.
00:32:30.531,00:32:33.493,I thought you might be able to point us toward the next of kin.
00:32:33.576,00:32:34.995,"No, she didn't have anyone."
00:32:36.746,00:32:37.872,Just us.
00:32:39.332,00:32:40.959,We'll see to the arrangements.
00:32:42.835,00:32:44.712,It's good of you to take that on.
00:32:45.880,00:32:47.840,I'll let the ME know.
00:33:14.284,00:33:15.285,Ahhh!
00:33:35.471,00:33:38.099,You are a worthy opponent.
00:33:39.309,00:33:42.437,It is an honor to claim your life.
00:34:27.440,00:34:29.192,"I'll keep 'em comin', love."
00:34:36.741,00:34:40.828,"When we first took the case, Karen and I went to Landman and Zack."
00:34:40.911,00:34:44.207,Marci talked about a criminal element in Elena's building.
00:34:45.458,00:34:48.043,Said that's why the workmen left without finishing the repairs.
00:34:49.087,00:34:50.963,'Cause they feared for their safety.
00:34:52.382,00:34:54.550,I thought it was bullshit.
00:34:56.302,00:34:57.303,Maybe it was.
00:34:57.387,00:34:59.222,Tell that to Elena.
00:35:00.473,00:35:01.891,"Wait, what are you saying?"
00:35:03.643,00:35:04.852,"Well, I don't know."
00:35:06.604,00:35:08.063,"Just doesn't feel right, does it?"
00:35:08.148,00:35:09.857,I'll drink to that.
00:35:09.940,00:35:11.651,You think it was a coincidence?
00:35:15.155,00:35:20.326,"Elena decides to stay and fight, to rally what's left of her neighbors, and this happens."
00:35:20.410,00:35:24.205,Do you think Fisk had something to do with this?
00:35:25.498,00:35:26.666,Speak of the devil.
00:35:30.461,00:35:32.004,Fisk is on the TV again.
00:35:32.087,00:35:34.089,"Hey, Josie, could you turn that up?"
00:35:39.595,00:35:41.847,I only recently took possession of her building.
00:35:41.931,00:35:46.936,How do you respond to reports that you knew the tenement was unsafe?
00:35:47.019,00:35:48.229,That is accurate.
00:35:48.313,00:35:53.568,That's why we offered a substantial sum to Ms. Cardenas and her neighbors to help them relocate.
00:35:55.611,00:35:58.030,We should never let good people get swallowed up by this city.
00:35:59.907,00:36:01.992,I mourn this woman's death.
00:36:03.286,00:36:11.001,Didn't have to happen. It should've-- Her passing is a symptom of a larger disease...
00:36:13.504,00:36:14.630,Disease of fear...
00:36:14.714,00:36:15.881,Funeral home.
00:36:18.551,00:36:19.969,Hello?
00:36:22.012,00:36:23.181,"Yeah, I need to make arrangements."
00:36:26.559,00:36:29.187,We need to stand together.
00:36:29.270,00:36:31.231,Let them know that they will fail...
00:36:32.064,00:36:34.400,because we believe we can make a difference.
00:36:37.237,00:36:38.696,'Cause they are cowards!
00:36:39.614,00:36:42.492,Afraid of stepping out of the shadows.
00:36:42.575,00:36:46.120,Afraid of standing up for people like Mrs. Cardenas.
00:36:47.580,00:36:49.915,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
00:36:49.999,00:36:51.417,"Mr. Fisk, how does this affect the upcoming benefit?"
00:36:59.091,00:37:01.051,"Jesus, he almost sounds like he means it."
00:37:03.346,00:37:05.806,And he's calling the man in the mask a psycho?
00:37:05.890,00:37:08.518,I hope they trace what happened to Elena right to his doorstep.
00:37:08.601,00:37:10.436,He'd never expose himself like that.
00:37:11.854,00:37:13.939,"Plus, half the force is probably in his pocket."
00:37:16.025,00:37:19.237,"Well, then, let's pray the Mask gets his hands on him."
00:37:20.446,00:37:22.573,Knocks his goddamn head off.
00:37:27.912,00:37:29.414,"You religious, Karen?"
00:37:30.456,00:37:32.041,My parents were.
00:37:33.501,00:37:35.628,That's probably why I'm not.
00:37:37.463,00:37:38.548,You?
00:37:40.090,00:37:41.926,Catholic.
00:37:45.971,00:37:47.432,Does it help?
00:37:52.353,00:37:53.813,Not today.
00:37:57.942,00:37:59.610,I think I've had enough.
00:38:02.572,00:38:05.450,-Tell Foggy I'll see him in the morning. -Yeah.
00:38:09.787,00:38:11.038,"Hey, Matt."
00:38:11.121,00:38:12.247,Yeah?
00:38:15.293,00:38:17.378,If there is a God...
00:38:18.504,00:38:20.798,and if he cares at all about...
00:38:20.881,00:38:23.008,about any of us...
00:38:25.260,00:38:27.597,Fisk will get what he deserves.
00:38:28.848,00:38:30.641,You have to believe that.
00:38:32.101,00:38:33.268,I do.
00:40:33.681,00:40:35.057,Tell me what you do know.
00:40:37.852,00:40:39.854,"Just, please, stop hurting me!"
00:41:54.804,00:41:56.847,"Hey, you're real, you're... You're real..."
00:41:57.848,00:42:00.560,-Where'd you get the purse? -What purse?
00:42:07.191,00:42:09.151,Lying? Bad idea.
00:42:11.028,00:42:12.697,"Please, stop! I'm... I'm sick."
00:42:24.750,00:42:29.004,"The asshole that killed Mrs. Cardenas shoots up at this address, likes cheap menthols."
00:42:29.088,00:42:32.633,Thinks it covers the stench of his rotting teeth. It doesn't.
00:42:40.349,00:42:41.350,Was it Fisk?
00:42:43.143,00:42:44.604,Was it Wilson Fisk?
00:42:44.687,00:42:47.439,"No, I don't know! Please, stop! Please!"
00:42:47.522,00:42:48.523,Give me a reason to!
00:42:48.608,00:42:52.027,I don't know their names. I don't! They found me.
00:42:54.321,00:42:55.865,Pier 81.
00:42:55.948,00:42:57.532,"I didn't wanna do it, man."
00:42:57.617,00:42:59.952,I swear. I didn't wanna do it!
00:43:00.035,00:43:03.122,"But I was hurting. I was hurting, man."
00:43:09.629,00:43:10.713,You're gonna turn yourself in...
00:43:12.131,00:43:15.509,to Sergeant Brett Mahoney at the 15th Precinct.
00:43:15.593,00:43:19.847,"If you don't, I'll find you. And next time, I'm not gonna stop."
00:44:16.696,00:44:18.989,I didn't come here for you.
00:44:38.133,00:44:41.303,You were at the docks with the boy.
00:44:44.014,00:44:45.683,with the old fool.
00:44:47.267,00:44:49.478,That was unexpected.
00:44:55.650,00:44:59.279,"And in the act, caused me displeasure."
00:45:02.032,00:45:03.784,Did Fisk send you?
00:45:05.494,00:45:15.337,"Is that why he paid that junkie to-- A woman is dead, and for what? Just to lure me into some kind of a trap?"
00:45:15.420,00:45:19.508,"You are here, are you not?"
00:45:23.053,00:45:26.098,Made that mistake with the Russians once. Learned from it.
00:45:33.063,00:45:34.899,you slowed your heart...
00:45:36.901,00:45:39.194,lowered your body temperature.
00:45:47.369,00:45:49.413,deserving of a warrior's death.
00:45:49.496,00:45:51.832,I came here for Fisk.
00:45:53.208,00:45:54.919,Guess I'll have to settle for you.
00:46:02.717,00:46:05.679,You would be wise to return the courtesy.
00:46:07.306,00:46:08.933,You'll have to earn it.
00:46:48.597,00:46:51.683,"No, no, never mind, Josie. Hey, hey, Foggy."
00:46:55.062,00:46:56.563,"way, way past that."
00:46:56.646,00:46:58.065,"It's a wake, Karen."
00:46:59.399,00:47:00.985,People drink at wakes.
00:47:01.068,00:47:02.152,You don't need it.
00:47:02.236,00:47:03.570,You know why?
00:47:04.696,00:47:05.822,'Cause it sucks.
00:47:08.325,00:47:09.826,You speak Spanish.
00:47:11.328,00:47:13.998,What's a good toast for the people that should...
00:47:14.081,00:47:15.790,-That should still... -Hey.
00:47:16.876,00:47:18.085,"Hey, hey, hey."
00:47:20.504,00:47:22.381,"No, no, no, no, Foggy..."
00:47:22.464,00:47:25.968,"it's not your fault, okay?"
00:47:32.933,00:47:35.560,The Hell's Kitchen I grew up in was a real shithole.
00:47:35.644,00:47:37.187,"But it had a heart, you know?"
00:47:37.271,00:47:39.231,Yeah.
00:47:39.314,00:47:42.526,Me and Matt... we learned the law...
00:47:42.609,00:47:44.403,how to play by the rules.
00:47:45.779,00:47:48.407,We were gonna help the people that we grew up with.
00:47:48.490,00:47:51.201,Give 'em the same shot as the big boys like Fisk.
00:47:53.495,00:47:54.579,It's all bullshit.
00:47:56.957,00:47:59.751,lies that we tell ourselves to make it through one more day.
00:47:59.834,00:48:02.712,"No, I don't... I don't believe that."
00:48:02.796,00:48:04.464,I can't.
00:48:06.258,00:48:09.053,What are we supposed to do...
00:48:09.136,00:48:13.933,against somebody that owns everything?
00:48:14.016,00:48:15.309,Everyone?
00:48:18.853,00:48:20.772,What can we do to somebody like that?
00:48:21.773,00:48:23.775,The only thing you can...
00:48:26.403,00:48:28.405,you make them pay.
00:49:34.054,00:49:36.140,Nobu was becoming an issue.
00:49:38.017,00:49:41.853,I appreciate you... removing him from concern.
00:49:46.316,00:49:50.529,"In a perfect world, you would have taken each other out, but..."
00:49:51.530,00:49:54.699,"it isn't a perfect world, is it?"
00:49:54.783,00:49:56.035,Not yet.
00:49:57.452,00:50:01.165,To be honest... it took longer than I expected.
00:50:02.374,00:50:05.085,Nobu didn't mind. He meditated for hours.
00:50:05.169,00:50:07.546,I find it difficult to meditate.
00:50:07.629,00:50:10.257,"My mind, it won't quiet."
00:50:15.887,00:50:17.514,We all have them.
00:50:19.224,00:50:20.475,"You, for instance."
00:50:21.310,00:50:25.897,You've demonstrated an emotional weakness for children and women.
00:50:25.980,00:50:28.775,I assumed that would extend to the elderly.
00:50:30.110,00:50:31.903,So I baited the hook.
00:50:33.613,00:50:35.199,Here you are.
00:50:39.328,00:50:42.081,just to get my attention?
00:50:46.042,00:50:49.671,"My options, they were limited by necessity."
00:50:50.880,00:50:53.049,I took no pleasure in her passing.
00:51:03.560,00:51:05.312,Take your shot.
00:52:11.795,00:52:13.797,It's disappointing.
00:52:18.593,00:52:20.345,Wesley.
00:52:56.631,00:52:58.800,Put men on the dock.
00:52:58.883,00:53:01.720,"If they see the Mask, put a bullet in him."
00:53:05.974,00:53:07.559,What about Nobu?
00:53:10.770,00:53:12.606,Let him burn.
00:53:19.696,00:53:21.406,Matt!
00:53:21.490,00:53:22.782,"Come on, Matt."
00:53:22.866,00:53:25.201,"I need to talk to you, Matt."
00:53:33.710,00:53:36.170,We gotta nail that bastard to the wall.
00:53:36.255,00:53:39.173,We gotta make him pay... for Elena...
00:53:44.971,00:53:45.972,Matt?
00:53:46.055,00:53:49.476,Are you okay in there? Matt?
00:53:51.811,00:53:52.937,Matt!
00:53:58.818,00:53:59.944,Matt?
00:54:07.118,00:54:08.620,I heard a crash.
00:54:10.289,00:54:13.542,"Not the fun, sexy-time kind, but..."
00:54:15.335,00:54:16.878,more of the...
00:54:16.961,00:54:19.213,I've-fallen-and-I-can't-get-up variety.
00:54:22.801,00:54:23.927,Matt?
00:54:42.904,00:54:45.281,I will mess you up. I'm not kidding.
00:54:55.334,00:54:58.044,Where's Matt? What'd you do to him?
00:55:12.058,00:55:13.184,Shit.
00:55:54.100,00:55:55.602,Matt?
00:09:29.151,00:09:33.615,"I have never seen you, absent your man by your side."
00:09:33.698,00:09:37.284,No need for a translator now.
00:09:37.368,00:09:38.995,Or pretenses.
00:09:50.632,00:09:54.719,"There was a snake, in the village where I was raised..."
00:09:55.261,00:09:59.473,who mistook an elephant as prey.
00:09:59.556,00:10:01.934,It died...
00:10:02.018,00:10:03.978,with its jaws wide...
00:10:05.104,00:10:11.944,"clenched around no more than the elephant's foot, betrayed by ambition."
00:10:13.988,00:10:16.157,Am I the snake...
00:10:16.240,00:10:17.617,or the elephant?
00:10:18.492,00:10:22.622,What happened to Nobu was...
00:10:22.705,00:10:23.831,unfortunate.
00:10:23.915,00:10:26.709,I asked for a warrior...
00:10:27.543,00:10:29.295,to eliminate...
00:10:30.963,00:10:33.257,He chose to take it upon himself.
00:10:33.340,00:10:36.218,He is a man of pride.
00:10:37.011,00:10:38.930,Something well known to you.
00:10:40.056,00:10:41.223,What's done...
00:10:43.225,00:10:46.312,And the man in the mask...
00:10:46.395,00:10:48.314,you have found his body?
00:10:49.523,00:10:50.942,No.
00:10:54.862,00:10:56.864,prepare his...
00:10:56.948,00:10:59.325,for what is to come.
00:11:02.619,00:11:05.665,They are distracted.
00:11:05.748,00:11:08.334,But their memories...
00:11:08.417,00:11:11.337,and their knives...
00:11:11.420,00:11:14.340,are forever sharp.
00:11:14.423,00:11:18.302,Is that why you wanted to meet?
00:11:19.053,00:11:20.847,To warn me...
00:11:20.930,00:11:23.891,of what I already know?
00:11:25.559,00:11:28.354,I only sought to pose a question.
00:11:28.437,00:11:30.773,How long before...
00:11:30.857,00:11:34.110,your ambition turns to me?
00:11:39.656,00:11:41.033,My respect.
00:11:43.160,00:11:45.162,Perhaps.
00:11:45.246,00:11:47.414,Yet...
00:11:47.498,00:11:50.626,you are not the man who came to me...
00:11:50.709,00:11:52.669,with a dream...
00:11:52.754,00:11:54.713,for this city.
00:11:55.506,00:11:57.884,He was of a...
00:11:57.967,00:11:59.468,singular mind.
00:12:01.178,00:12:05.641,Yours now is pulled in two directions...
00:12:09.896,00:12:12.231,Is that why we're here?
00:12:12.314,00:12:14.191,To discuss...
00:12:14.275,00:12:15.818,my private affairs?
00:12:17.028,00:12:18.529,No.
00:12:18.612,00:12:20.739,We are here...
00:12:20.823,00:12:22.784,to discuss your fate.
00:00:39.122,00:00:40.707,"Oh, God."
00:01:18.620,00:01:20.580,"Then again, maybe I would."
00:01:21.581,00:01:24.292,The hell do I know about Matt Murdock?
00:01:24.376,00:01:27.003,-You stitched me up? -Nope.
00:01:29.631,00:01:31.048,That was your nurse friend.
00:01:31.716,00:01:32.800,Claire?
00:01:33.301,00:01:36.846,You had me get a hold of her after you took a swing at me for trying to get you to the hospital.
00:01:38.431,00:01:39.974,I don't remember.
00:01:41.726,00:01:42.727,Sorry.
00:01:45.397,00:01:47.190,"She was hot, by the way."
00:01:49.025,00:01:50.943,"But I guess you already knew that, huh?"
00:01:51.027,00:01:53.280,"-Foggy... -Just tell me one thing, Matt."
00:01:54.406,00:01:56.616,Are you even really blind?
00:03:00.555,00:03:03.225,God damn it! Come on!
00:03:07.061,00:03:09.689,"-What? -Excuse me, is this room 312?"
00:03:09.772,00:03:12.149,"Yeah, who're you looking for?"
00:03:14.319,00:03:16.195,"Oh... uh, sorry."
00:03:17.154,00:03:19.574,"-What for? -You're blind, right?"
00:03:20.408,00:03:22.410,"Uh, yeah, so they tell me."
00:03:22.494,00:03:25.455,-I hope that won't be a problem. -Why would it?
00:03:25.997,00:03:27.164,Oh!
00:03:27.249,00:03:28.833,You're-- You're my roomie!
00:03:28.916,00:03:30.752,"Uh, Matt Murdock."
00:03:32.837,00:03:33.963,Foggy Nelson.
00:03:34.714,00:03:40.303,"Wait, Matt Murdock? Are you-- -You're not from Hell's Kitchen, are you? -Yeah, born and raised."
00:03:41.178,00:03:42.430,So am I!
00:03:42.514,00:03:46.684,"Yeah, I heard about you when you were a kid, what you did, saving that guy crossing the street."
00:03:46.768,00:03:49.354,"Yeah, I-- I just did what anyone would have."
00:03:49.437,00:03:51.523,Bullshit. You are a hero.
00:03:52.899,00:03:55.402,Come on! You got your peepers knocked out saving that old dude.
00:03:55.485,00:03:56.944,They didn't get knocked out.
00:03:57.028,00:04:01.699,"Good, 'cause that would be... a little freaky. But no offense."
00:04:01.783,00:04:04.118,"Please, none taken. Uh..."
00:04:05.077,00:04:09.165,Most people dance around me like I'm made of glass. I hate that.
00:04:09.249,00:04:12.168,"Yeah, you're just a guy, right?"
00:04:12.252,00:04:15.129,"A really, really good-looking guy."
00:04:16.839,00:04:17.840,"Oh, um..."
00:04:18.758,00:04:22.094,"I mean, girls must love that, the whole..."
00:04:22.178,00:04:24.013,"wounded, handsome duck thing."
00:04:26.223,00:04:27.850,"Yeah, it's been known to happen."
00:04:27.934,00:04:29.769,This is gonna be awesome!
00:04:29.852,00:04:30.978,What is?
00:04:31.062,00:04:32.314,Me as your wingman!
00:04:35.942,00:04:37.444,A lot!
00:04:37.527,00:04:38.986,We're gonna be like Maverick and Goose!
00:04:40.530,00:04:42.073,"Oh, shit!"
00:04:43.491,00:04:44.701,Yes.
00:04:45.910,00:04:48.788,-In what? -Punjabi. I got the last spot.
00:04:49.789,00:04:50.915,You're taking Punjabi?
00:04:50.998,00:04:54.419,It's spoken by 130 million people. I'd like to know what they're saying.
00:04:54.502,00:04:57.380,"-That's the only reason? -Well, yeah."
00:04:57.464,00:05:00.425,"I mean, why else would I learn it?"
00:05:01.426,00:05:03.678,"I don't know... a girl, maybe?"
00:05:03.761,00:05:06.931,See? This is what I'm talking about.
00:05:07.014,00:05:10.477,"Me and you... Maverick and Goose, no secrets."
00:05:10.560,00:05:13.187,Goose died... and he was married.
00:05:13.270,00:05:14.397,Details.
00:05:14.481,00:05:16.983,"Hey, do you know a good place to get a cup of coffee on campus?"
00:05:17.066,00:05:19.151,"-No. -Well, lucky for you, I do."
00:05:19.235,00:05:21.529,And it's filled with luscious coeds. Shall we?
00:05:21.613,00:05:23.030,"Yeah, lead the way."
00:05:26.326,00:05:27.452,"So, you can see."
00:05:27.535,00:05:30.955,That's not-- You're not-- Are you even listening to what I'm saying?
00:05:31.038,00:05:34.501,"Yeah, world on fire, I got it. But you can see, right?"
00:05:34.584,00:05:38.337,"Yeah, in a manner of speaking. But I-- No! No manner!"
00:05:39.881,00:05:41.424,How many fingers am I holding up?
00:05:42.967,00:05:44.301,One.
00:05:56.814,00:05:59.150,"All these years, I actually felt sorry for you."
00:05:59.233,00:06:01.778,I didn't ask for that. I never-- I never asked for that.
00:06:01.861,00:06:04.071,"Yeah, I didn't ask to be lied to."
00:06:06.073,00:06:08.493,"You've lied to me, Matt, since the day we met."
00:06:08.576,00:06:10.912,"What did you expect me to say, Foggy?"
00:06:10.995,00:06:16.333,"Hi, I'm Matt. I got some chemicals splashed in my eyes when I was a kid that gave me heightened senses."
00:06:16.418,00:06:17.877,"Well, maybe not lead with that."
00:06:17.960,00:06:20.755,I didn't even tell my dad after it happened.
00:06:20.838,00:06:22.131,"But you told that nurse, Claire."
00:06:22.214,00:06:24.216,Because I didn't have a choice.
00:06:26.010,00:06:28.888,"She found me in a dumpster, all right? Half dead."
00:06:28.971,00:06:30.515,She didn't-- She didn't tell you?
00:06:30.598,00:06:33.851,She wouldn't say anything about all this.
00:06:35.853,00:06:37.021,She seemed nice.
00:06:38.189,00:06:39.315,She is.
00:06:51.494,00:06:55.206,Did you blow up those buildings? Shoot those cops?
00:06:55.289,00:06:57.834,You really even need to ask that?
00:06:57.917,00:07:00.336,"Yeah, I think I do."
00:07:06.551,00:07:08.260,It was all Fisk.
00:07:08.928,00:07:12.223,-He did this to you? -He and Nobu.
00:07:12.306,00:07:13.516,Nobu?
00:07:13.600,00:07:16.811,"Yeah, I think he's some kind of... ninja."
00:07:18.646,00:07:20.106,A ninja.
00:07:20.189,00:07:21.566,I think.
00:07:21.649,00:07:24.193,"What are you doing, Matt?"
00:07:24.276,00:07:26.654,You're a lawyer. You're supposed to be helping people.
00:07:26.738,00:07:27.864,I am.
00:07:27.947,00:07:29.406,In a mask!
00:07:29.491,00:07:31.408,Do you know what they call that? A vigilante.
00:07:31.493,00:07:33.202,Someone who acts outside of the law.
00:07:36.330,00:07:40.292,Karen. Karen. Karen.
00:07:40.376,00:07:42.044,"Foggy, Foggy, Foggy."
00:07:42.128,00:07:44.881,"-She deserves to know. -You can't tell her, Foggy, please."
00:07:47.967,00:07:50.136,"When we call, trying to get you to come out for drinks?"
00:07:50.219,00:07:53.556,Trying to find you when bombs are going off and we're worried?
00:07:58.310,00:07:59.395,No.
00:08:06.068,00:08:08.279,"-It's her again. -Please, Foggy."
00:08:10.990,00:08:12.867,-Hey. -Hey.
00:08:12.950,00:08:14.577,I tried calling Matt. Where are you guys?
00:08:14.661,00:08:16.037,We're at his place.
00:08:16.120,00:08:17.371,Is everything okay?
00:08:26.005,00:08:28.007,"Oh, my God."
00:08:28.090,00:08:29.884,What happened?
00:08:30.467,00:08:32.094,He was in a car accident.
00:08:32.178,00:08:36.683,"-Matt was driving? -No, he, um-- He got hit."
00:08:36.766,00:08:40.061,"Well, is he all right? Look, I-- I'm coming over."
00:08:40.144,00:08:42.146,"No, stay at the office. We need you there."
00:08:42.229,00:08:44.816,-There's nothing you can do here. -Okay.
00:08:48.736,00:08:51.072,I'll call you if we need anything.
00:08:57.704,00:08:59.121,Thank you.
00:08:59.205,00:09:03.585,Screw you. I just lied to somebody that I care about.
00:09:03.668,00:09:06.295,I want to know everything.
00:09:06.378,00:09:09.632,And don't you leave a damn thing out.
00:12:31.083,00:12:34.128,So there is no mistaking my words.
00:12:36.213,00:12:38.841,There is conflict within you.
00:12:38.925,00:12:40.426,Conflict?
00:12:41.468,00:12:46.057,Man cannot be both savior and oppressor...
00:12:47.349,00:12:50.227,light and shadow.
00:12:51.228,00:12:54.816,One has to be sacrificed for the other.
00:12:58.945,00:13:03.782,Choose... and choose wisely.
00:13:10.747,00:13:14.126,Or others shall choose for you.
00:13:31.227,00:13:32.937,"Hello, gorgeous."
00:13:47.034,00:13:48.077,"Hello, handsome."
00:13:54.708,00:13:57.086,You're wearing that aftershave.
00:13:57.169,00:13:59.838,"-You remember? -Of course, I do."
00:14:04.843,00:14:05.970,I've missed you.
00:14:09.556,00:14:11.642,They say anything?
00:14:14.103,00:14:15.354,"They, um..."
00:14:16.981,00:14:18.649,They think you're improving.
00:14:26.615,00:14:27.658,Uh...
00:14:27.741,00:14:29.618,"It's nothing. Just, uh..."
00:14:31.828,00:14:34.123,outsmarted by a story.
00:14:34.206,00:14:36.833,You'll figure it out. Always do.
00:14:42.589,00:14:45.009,"I should be here with you, not, uh..."
00:14:46.552,00:14:49.305,"chasing down leads, getting my ass in trouble."
00:14:51.098,00:14:54.268,Your name is Ben Urich...
00:14:54.351,00:14:56.853,and you are a reporter.
00:14:56.938,00:15:00.441,It's not a job. It's who you are.
00:15:01.317,00:15:02.651,I don't know.
00:15:03.735,00:15:05.821,"This was 20 years ago, maybe."
00:15:08.324,00:15:12.286,I was... more fearless then.
00:15:14.914,00:15:16.999,Don't see much of that guy now.
00:15:19.335,00:15:23.422,"When we first met, you weren't fearless."
00:15:23.505,00:15:26.633,You were reckless... pushy.
00:15:26.717,00:15:31.680,"You were all about making a big splash, turning heads..."
00:15:31.763,00:15:34.225,You certainly turned mine.
00:15:35.392,00:15:38.938,But that's not who you were always supposed to be.
00:15:39.021,00:15:41.648,Experience made you more careful...
00:15:42.399,00:15:44.318,wise.
00:15:45.902,00:15:48.364,"I don't know, Ben Urich..."
00:15:49.156,00:15:52.618,I think your best work is still ahead.
00:15:54.120,00:15:57.831,You keep sweet-talking... I'm gonna climb in there with you.
00:16:11.262,00:16:12.388,Doris?
00:16:14.473,00:16:15.682,Baby?
00:16:20.312,00:16:22.898,"Hello, gorgeous."
00:16:28.529,00:16:29.821,"Hello, handsome."
00:16:36.578,00:16:37.997,I'll be right back.
00:16:46.463,00:16:48.299,Is this about the extension?
00:16:48.382,00:16:50.676,"Let's speak outside, yeah?"
00:17:02.604,00:17:04.106,I did everything.
00:17:30.924,00:17:32.509,The hell you get all this crap?
00:17:32.593,00:17:34.303,The Internet.
00:17:35.346,00:17:36.472,The Internet.
00:17:38.599,00:17:42.728,Thought you long-underwear types stitched these together yourselves.
00:17:45.522,00:17:47.108,I never learned how to sew.
00:17:48.442,00:17:50.069,But you learned how to fight.
00:17:51.653,00:17:55.532,"That news footage of you... in the alley, after the bombings..."
00:17:55.616,00:17:57.784,the way you were flipping around...
00:17:58.702,00:18:00.746,Your dad was a boxer.
00:18:02.581,00:18:06.377,He didn't want me to fight. You know that.
00:18:06.460,00:18:07.919,"So, how'd you get so good at it?"
00:18:12.299,00:18:14.343,An old man named Stick.
00:18:16.428,00:18:18.097,He found me at the orphanage.
00:18:19.055,00:18:20.807,Blind like me.
00:18:20.891,00:18:24.019,"Well, almost like me."
00:18:24.103,00:18:28.732,A blind old man... taught you the ancient ways of martial arts.
00:18:29.358,00:18:30.734,Isn't that the plot to Kung Fu?
00:18:30.817,00:18:32.236,I know how it sounds.
00:18:33.487,00:18:34.821,I don't think that you do.
00:18:34.905,00:18:36.532,He did more than start my training.
00:18:36.615,00:18:39.160,"He taught me that my blindness wasn't a disability, that..."
00:18:42.454,00:18:44.873,He helped me understand everything I could do.
00:18:44.956,00:18:46.708,Define everything.
00:18:50.045,00:18:52.756,"I just know things, okay?"
00:18:52.839,00:18:54.383,"No, not okay."
00:18:54.466,00:18:57.344,Can you read my mind? Can you predict the future? What?
00:18:57.428,00:18:59.054,What things do you just know?
00:18:59.138,00:19:02.641,I know you haven't showered since yesterday morning.
00:19:02.724,00:19:04.893,But you rinsed your face in my kitchen sink.
00:19:06.478,00:19:10.023,I know you had onions in your lunch two days ago.
00:19:10.106,00:19:12.526,I know you're hungry... and tired.
00:19:12.609,00:19:15.779,"And I know the more I say, the faster your heart beats."
00:19:18.157,00:19:21.160,You can hear a heartbeat? From across the room?
00:19:24.496,00:19:27.416,When someone's gonna attack... when they're lying.
00:19:27.499,00:19:30.169,That's how you knew Karen was telling the truth...
00:19:30.252,00:19:33.214,-when we first met her at the precinct. -Yeah.
00:19:34.506,00:19:37.884,You listened to her heartbeat without her permission?
00:19:37.968,00:19:41.513,We're lawyers! You can't do that!
00:19:41.597,00:19:49.938,"There's a system in place, and it's weird and invasive and-- Wait."
00:19:51.440,00:19:57.153,"Are you telling me that since I've known you, any time I wasn't telling the truth, you knew?"
00:19:58.280,00:20:01.408,"And what, you just played along?"
00:20:03.369,00:20:04.620,Basically.
00:20:06.372,00:20:08.749,"If you weren't half dead, I would kick your ass, Murdock."
00:20:08.832,00:20:10.501,Am I lying about that?
00:20:11.543,00:20:12.753,No.
00:20:17.716,00:20:21.428,"Watch out, everybody! I'm Blind Matt Murdock! Whoa!"
00:20:21.512,00:20:24.806,"Most-- Most people just say, Matt Murdock."
00:20:24.890,00:20:26.767,I look like most people?
00:20:26.850,00:20:28.059,"I don't know, I can't see you."
00:20:28.143,00:20:31.355,"Well, at the moment, that may be a blessing."
00:20:31.438,00:20:33.774,"Oh, God, we should be studying."
00:20:33.857,00:20:37.653,"You're gonna graduate summa cum laude, you can take a night off, you nerd!"
00:20:40.947,00:20:44.285,"You'd be graduating with that, too, if you took a few less nights off."
00:20:44.368,00:20:49.873,"Point being, we are both one day gonna be fine, upstanding members of the legal profession."
00:20:49.956,00:20:53.043,El grande-- How do you say lawyers in Spanish?
00:20:53.126,00:20:56.129,Lawyers? Abogados.
00:21:01.092,00:21:04.012,-That's fruit. -It's a vegetable at best.
00:21:18.151,00:21:19.736,of business.
00:21:19.820,00:21:21.613,"Couple years, we'll all be speaking it."
00:21:21.697,00:21:24.115,And she was so hot. She was so hot!
00:21:29.079,00:21:33.292,"-God! Shut up! Kiss my ass. -You can't speak-- No! No, no, no, no."
00:21:33.375,00:21:37.003,Are you trying to tell me that you didn't take Spanish -to snuggle up to what's-her-name... -What?
00:21:37.087,00:21:39.047,...the Greek girl?
00:21:39.130,00:21:41.800,"Well, I... surely I would take Greek?"
00:21:41.883,00:21:46.597,"No, because she was taking Spanish. She already spoke Greek."
00:21:46.680,00:21:48.849,Whatever happened to her? She was smokin'.
00:21:51.226,00:21:55.271,"When does it ever with you, buddy? How can I help you?"
00:21:58.024,00:21:59.360,I don't know.
00:21:59.443,00:22:01.528,I guess just someone I really like listening to.
00:22:08.243,00:22:10.579,Yes... we sit!
00:22:13.540,00:22:14.875,and more libations!
00:22:16.209,00:22:17.836,How about just the burgers?
00:22:17.919,00:22:19.588,Lightweight!
00:22:19.671,00:22:21.507,"Hey, do you get the spins?"
00:22:23.800,00:22:26.470,"-Can you get those if you can't see? -Yeah, I get the spins."
00:22:31.016,00:22:35.396,"Liquid in your inner ear gets disturbed, has trouble leveling off or something."
00:22:37.355,00:22:38.440,Huh.
00:22:38.524,00:22:42.152,That sucks. I thought you might get a pass on that one.
00:22:42.235,00:22:44.362,"No, it's even worse for me, I think."
00:22:44.446,00:22:46.698,'Cause my senses are so-- Are...
00:22:47.616,00:22:48.617,Mmm.
00:22:49.367,00:22:51.327,-So what? Delicate? -Hmm?
00:22:51.412,00:22:54.873,Yeah... you could say that.
00:22:55.666,00:22:58.126,"Hey, how old were you when you had your first drink?"
00:22:58.209,00:23:00.754,-Nine. -Nine?
00:23:01.963,00:23:03.173,Lush.
00:23:03.256,00:23:05.426,My dad gave me a sip from this bottle of Scotch.
00:23:05.509,00:23:06.593,"Go, Dad!"
00:23:06.677,00:23:09.179,He didn't want my hands shaking while I stitched him up.
00:23:09.262,00:23:13.559,He got cut pretty bad over his eye. Boxing match.
00:23:13.642,00:23:14.935,He win?
00:23:16.562,00:23:17.604,No.
00:23:21.608,00:23:25.070,"-He'd be proud of you, buddy. -Thanks, man."
00:23:26.321,00:23:29.115,"All he ever wanted was for me to use my head, not my fists."
00:23:30.116,00:23:31.201,Not like him.
00:23:32.703,00:23:34.913,My mom wanted me to be a butcher.
00:23:36.081,00:23:38.374,I think she liked the idea of free ham.
00:23:39.585,00:23:41.712,"Hey, they coming to graduation? Your family?"
00:23:41.795,00:23:43.547,The whole extended brood.
00:23:43.630,00:23:45.466,It's not every day a...
00:23:45.549,00:23:48.719,Nelson breaks from the ranks of hardware and cured meats.
00:23:48.802,00:23:51.638,"Franklin Nelson for the defense, Your Honor."
00:23:51.722,00:23:54.099,Defense! I like that. There's money in that.
00:23:54.182,00:23:55.892,"Oh, come on. Is that all you care about?"
00:23:55.976,00:23:57.811,No... No.
00:23:58.729,00:24:00.731,Truth and justice and all of that.
00:24:05.944,00:24:07.195,"Me and you, pal."
00:24:07.278,00:24:15.453,"We're gonna have big, fancy offices one day, with steel and glass and chairs you don't even know how to sit in."
00:24:16.538,00:24:18.206,"Murdock and Nelson, attorneys at law!"
00:24:18.289,00:24:21.126,Nelson and Murdock. Sounds better.
00:24:22.127,00:24:23.629,"-You think? -Yeah, trust me."
00:24:24.838,00:24:27.799,"I can't see worth shit, but my hearing's spectacular."
00:24:29.425,00:24:32.804,"Me and you, pal... We're gonna do this."
00:24:33.555,00:24:37.017,We're gonna be the best damn avocados this city has ever seen.
00:24:41.980,00:24:44.691,"Let's get the hell out of here, come on."
00:25:02.000,00:25:04.628,Hey... got a minute?
00:25:05.546,00:25:07.213,Yeah.
00:25:20.644,00:25:23.313,I don't know. You tell me.
00:25:27.776,00:25:29.235,It's personal. You mind?
00:25:31.154,00:25:32.363,Just checking.
00:25:41.164,00:25:45.501,Haverson cornered me in the bathroom this morning.
00:25:49.923,00:25:54.636,"Maybe. He's packing it in, the end of the month."
00:25:54.720,00:25:57.973,Wants to spend quality time with his grandkids or some such bullshit.
00:25:59.390,00:26:01.267,Metro could use you.
00:26:01.351,00:26:05.230,It's a good section. No more running around.
00:26:05.313,00:26:06.857,I'm no editor.
00:26:06.940,00:26:08.524,I'm a reporter.
00:26:08.609,00:26:11.444,"Yeah, well, that's what I said. Now, look how fancy I am."
00:26:14.990,00:26:17.492,"Well, I'm-- I'm just saying..."
00:26:17.575,00:26:19.494,be nice to keep the wheels on the wagon.
00:26:19.577,00:26:22.288,"Get you a bump, better benefits."
00:26:22.372,00:26:25.375,"You know, for whatever comes up."
00:26:26.793,00:26:28.169,I'll think about it.
00:26:39.014,00:26:40.390,Thanks.
00:26:41.349,00:26:43.434,Just let me know...
00:27:20.764,00:27:23.224,"Foggy, it's me, again."
00:27:23.308,00:27:25.811,"Call me back. Um, it's important."
00:27:44.996,00:27:46.664,-Shit! -You're out of cream.
00:27:48.374,00:27:52.420,"Uh, yeah, I know. It's, um-- It's on my, uh..."
00:27:52.503,00:27:54.547,-How did you get in here? -Front door.
00:27:54.630,00:27:55.924,You jimmied it?
00:27:56.007,00:27:57.968,Unlocked.
00:27:58.051,00:28:00.971,"I keep telling you, you got to be more careful."
00:28:01.888,00:28:03.181,I am.
00:28:03.807,00:28:05.433,"No, I... I am."
00:28:09.104,00:28:13.483,"I was out getting lunch and I thought, What the hell, I'll swing by the county clerk's office and see what I can find."
00:28:13.566,00:28:15.276,You gonna ask about the box?
00:28:17.028,00:28:18.029,Is that yours?
00:28:18.113,00:28:19.740,"No, yours."
00:28:21.282,00:28:23.034,Go ahead. You've earned it.
00:28:33.962,00:28:35.505,What the hell is this?
00:28:36.631,00:28:38.091,Everything I have on the story.
00:28:40.719,00:28:42.095,And why are you giving it to me?
00:28:42.178,00:28:44.723,I used to be like you back in the day.
00:28:45.681,00:28:48.476,"Good at turning heads, getting people's attention."
00:28:48.559,00:28:50.186,Pissing them off.
00:28:50.979,00:28:53.273,And that's half of it.
00:28:53.356,00:28:56.860,But the other half... is knowing when not to.
00:28:59.612,00:29:03.784,Do-- Do I have to convince you again just how important this is?
00:29:03.867,00:29:05.410,"I know how important it is, Karen."
00:29:05.493,00:29:07.537,It's just not the most important.
00:29:08.955,00:29:11.499,Not to me... not right now.
00:29:11.582,00:29:14.961,"Well, then where is this coming from? Did something happen?"
00:29:21.676,00:29:28.850,"-The extension didn't come through. -Oh, Ben, I-- I'm sorry."
00:29:31.895,00:29:33.563,I made a few calls.
00:29:34.564,00:29:37.818,"This place, I can't put her in here."
00:29:40.486,00:29:42.197,No.
00:29:42.280,00:29:44.866,Gonna take some time off and bring her home.
00:29:49.620,00:29:50.831,Come take a ride with me.
00:29:52.415,00:29:53.499,Where?
00:30:01.174,00:30:03.718,Uh... I think it might change your mind.
00:30:04.803,00:30:07.680,"-Karen. -No, just take a ride."
00:30:07.763,00:30:11.392,Come on. What could it hurt?
00:30:18.524,00:30:20.193,Okay.
00:30:29.828,00:30:32.205,You burned him alive?
00:30:32.288,00:30:34.290,Christ.
00:30:34.374,00:30:36.918,I never laid a hand on Nobu.
00:30:37.002,00:30:40.130,"So, you maneuvered that masked idiot to take him out."
00:30:40.213,00:30:41.672,Same result.
00:30:42.548,00:30:45.969,-I need you to speak with Gao. -Me?
00:30:46.052,00:30:48.596,The hell am I gonna say to her?
00:30:48.679,00:30:52.058,Reassure her... everything is fine.
00:30:52.642,00:30:54.060,"So, you want me to lie."
00:30:54.144,00:30:57.688,"Mmm, you weren't particularly fond of Nobu."
00:30:57.772,00:31:01.484,"You thought he was unsettling, if I recall."
00:31:01.567,00:31:05.405,I think you're unsettling half the time. See me lighting a match?
00:31:05.488,00:31:06.865,Wesley...
00:31:07.991,00:31:09.784,have the car brought around.
00:31:11.327,00:31:13.163,Let Vanessa know we're on our way.
00:31:13.246,00:31:14.789,Sir.
00:31:18.543,00:31:20.879,Ever since you started seeing that woman...
00:31:20.962,00:31:22.797,Leland.
00:31:24.090,00:31:26.801,"-You have a son, yes? -You know I do."
00:31:28.053,00:31:32.598,"Which means at some point in the past, I assume you met a woman..."
00:31:32.682,00:31:34.392,fell in love.
00:31:34.475,00:31:37.562,-What does that have to do with this? -Everything.
00:31:39.439,00:31:41.857,Gao is right. You've changed.
00:31:43.276,00:31:44.652,Change is inevitable...
00:31:47.113,00:31:49.282,for me... this city...
00:31:50.283,00:31:53.744,and certain relationships.
00:31:59.667,00:32:00.710,All right.
00:32:02.045,00:32:04.464,"All right, I'll go speak with her."
00:32:05.381,00:32:08.259,I appreciate your support in the matter.
00:32:08.343,00:32:10.053,"Sure, why not?"
00:32:10.136,00:32:12.513,"We're all in this together, right?"
00:32:22.648,00:32:24.150,Yeah.
00:32:24.234,00:32:26.402,"Yeah, okay. Thanks for reaching out."
00:32:34.285,00:32:36.121,-That was Brett. -What'd he say?
00:32:36.204,00:32:39.582,"You couldn't hear, with your... super whatever?"
00:32:39.665,00:32:43.253,It doesn't work like that. I-- I have to concentrate.
00:32:43.336,00:32:45.130,Focus on letting it in.
00:32:45.213,00:32:47.798,That junkie that killed Elena...
00:32:47.882,00:32:49.675,-they found him. -Good.
00:32:49.759,00:32:53.096,"Brett says he took a dive off the roof, building he was shooting up in."
00:32:54.180,00:32:56.099,They had to sponge him off the sidewalk.
00:32:58.893,00:33:00.353,I told him to turn himself in.
00:33:00.436,00:33:02.938,I can't hear your heartbeat. Are you telling me the truth?
00:33:03.023,00:33:04.440,"I didn't kill him, Foggy."
00:33:05.483,00:33:07.986,"It's Fisk, covering his ass."
00:33:08.069,00:33:11.489,"So, you've never-- You've never gone that far?"
00:33:11.572,00:33:12.573,No.
00:33:15.118,00:33:16.661,But I... I wanted to...
00:33:16.744,00:33:19.247,after Elena...
00:33:19.330,00:33:21.291,"after everything Fisk had done, I..."
00:33:22.417,00:33:25.128,I went to a warehouse I thought he'd be at.
00:33:27.547,00:33:29.715,I went to kill him.
00:33:30.550,00:33:32.885,It's not enough playing judge and jury?
00:33:35.096,00:33:37.015,I didn't think I had a choice.
00:33:37.098,00:33:41.102,What happened to all that talk about going after him through the system?
00:33:41.186,00:33:43.063,Making the law work for us?
00:33:44.814,00:33:46.774,Sometimes the law isn't enough.
00:33:49.277,00:34:06.752,"not only does my client Roxxon Energy Corporation categorically deny any culpability in your diagnosis, but also cites clear and actionable breach of contract regarding your decision to share details of your highly sensitive work in the Londonderry plant."
00:34:06.836,00:34:20.308,"And while my client is, uh... sympathetic towards your condition, Roxxon must vigorously defend its patents in relation to the extraction and refinement process that you, by admission, had intimate knowledge of."
00:34:20.391,00:34:23.144,"In light of this, we will be pursuing damages."
00:34:23.228,00:34:24.770,Damages?
00:34:25.688,00:34:31.194,You released sensitive information regarding-- The only person I ever told anything to was my doctor.
00:34:33.779,00:34:36.824,So that he could try to figure out what was wrong with me.
00:34:36.907,00:34:39.785,I didn't release anything.
00:34:45.916,00:34:47.127,Give us a minute.
00:34:53.174,00:34:54.175,-Hey. -Hey.
00:34:56.094,00:34:57.095,Guess what he heard?
00:34:57.178,00:34:58.554,They're gonna offer us the job.
00:34:58.638,00:35:00.640,No more interning in a broom closet.
00:35:00.723,00:35:05.019,We're each going to have our own office with a view of... something.
00:35:05.103,00:35:06.354,"We did it, buddy!"
00:35:06.437,00:35:08.773,Glass and steel at Landman and mother-effin' Zack...
00:35:08.856,00:35:10.608,Why do you have that look on your face?
00:35:10.691,00:35:11.817,Oh.
00:35:11.901,00:35:13.528,-What look? I-- -You know what look.
00:35:13.611,00:35:15.196,I've been reading Thurgood Marshall.
00:35:15.280,00:35:17.115,"Oh, shit, not Marshall."
00:35:17.198,00:35:19.742,We must dissent from the indifference. We must dissent from the apathy.
00:35:19.825,00:35:22.912,"-We must dissent from... -From the fear. Yeah, I know."
00:35:22.995,00:35:24.580,You've read it a million times.
00:35:24.664,00:35:26.582,You think what happened in there today was right?
00:35:26.666,00:35:28.334,"No, Matt, I don't think it was right."
00:35:28.418,00:35:33.088,"But according to the law, if he did disclose trade secrets -to a third party other than his doctor-- -He didn't."
00:35:33.173,00:35:34.549,How the hell do you know?
00:35:34.632,00:35:36.676,'Cause I... I have a feeling.
00:35:38.344,00:35:40.221,"Last time I checked, those are inadmissible."
00:35:40.305,00:35:43.183,Is this what you want... to be a part of that?
00:35:43.266,00:35:45.601,Protecting corporations from people that need help?
00:35:45.685,00:35:46.769,It doesn't have to be like that.
00:35:46.852,00:35:48.896,"We get a toehold, make partner..."
00:35:48.979,00:35:50.981,"And then in 10, 15 years, we what?"
00:35:53.484,00:35:55.778,On our way to work in our Bentleys?
00:35:55.861,00:36:00.491,You know how many of the other interns would kill for a real spot here?
00:36:00.575,00:36:02.743,Murder us in our sleep without a second thought.
00:36:02.827,00:36:05.496,"Well, then maybe those aren't the kind of people we should be working with."
00:36:13.713,00:36:15.047,Foggy?
00:36:16.257,00:36:17.842,What are you doing?
00:36:17.925,00:36:19.510,Well...
00:36:19.594,00:36:23.431,I'm gonna steal as many bagels as I can fit in this box.
00:36:23.514,00:36:27.017,"With you as my partner, there's no telling when I'll be able to afford a real meal again."
00:36:33.023,00:36:36.026,"Come on, Mother Teresa, let's go save the world."
00:36:36.110,00:36:37.570,Hey.
00:36:46.621,00:36:48.289,You want to say something.
00:36:49.039,00:36:50.082,Really don't.
00:36:53.669,00:36:55.963,Your breathing changes when you're about to.
00:37:00.175,00:37:01.761,Say what you need to say.
00:37:15.400,00:37:18.193,Why didn't you tell me it was that serious?
00:37:22.490,00:37:24.409,Saying it means it's true.
00:37:28.579,00:37:32.375,"She has her good moments. Lucid ones, you know?"
00:37:32.458,00:37:35.836,And she's sharp... and strong.
00:37:37.046,00:37:38.339,More than me.
00:37:39.340,00:37:41.259,But she always was.
00:37:45.012,00:37:46.889,She was always...
00:37:55.105,00:37:56.231,Yeah.
00:37:58.818,00:38:00.945,There's nothing worse...
00:38:01.028,00:38:04.615,feeling choices are made for us.
00:38:04.699,00:38:11.456,"There's nothing you can do, but swim in shit and hope you don't get too much in your mouth."
00:38:14.334,00:38:16.168,She'd like you.
00:38:18.588,00:38:21.632,"Should've taken you around to meet her, but..."
00:38:23.593,00:38:24.719,Yeah.
00:38:25.761,00:38:30.350,"You know, we all have things we hold onto for ourselves..."
00:38:32.393,00:38:33.978,that we don't want anyone to know.
00:38:34.770,00:38:37.357,But there's always someone who does...
00:38:39.525,00:38:41.151,sooner or later.
00:38:52.497,00:38:54.582,Shouldn't be too long.
00:38:54.665,00:38:55.916,-Thanks. -Mmm-hmm.
00:39:03.508,00:39:05.426,What are we doing here?
00:39:06.594,00:39:10.097,I can't afford this place. This is a waste of time.
00:39:12.850,00:39:15.102,Let's just take a look around.
00:39:15.185,00:39:17.397,Maybe it'll be worth the drive.
00:39:22.902,00:39:25.696,"You run around dressed like a moron, beating people up!"
00:39:25.780,00:39:28.699,"-It's not that simple and you know it. -No, I don't know shit."
00:39:28.783,00:39:35.373,"Not about this. I mean, how-- Okay, so you get these whatever-you-call-thems when you're a kid."
00:39:35.456,00:39:37.583,How do you go from that to what you're doing now?
00:39:39.585,00:39:42.254,"When I was a kid, before the accident..."
00:39:43.213,00:39:46.216,I'd lay awake at night listening to the sirens.
00:39:46.300,00:39:48.928,I liked to put stories to them.
00:39:49.011,00:39:51.972,"Trying to figure out what they were for, ambulance or cops, robbery or fire."
00:39:52.056,00:39:53.724,"I don't know, just a stupid game."
00:39:54.892,00:40:01.524,"But after I lost my sight, after my abilities developed, I realized how many sirens there actually were..."
00:40:02.733,00:40:04.985,how much this city suffered every single night.
00:40:05.069,00:40:07.488,You've been running around doing this since you were a kid?
00:40:07.572,00:40:10.240,No. I... I tried not to fight...
00:40:10.324,00:40:13.077,to make my dad proud. To... to block it out.
00:40:13.744,00:40:18.916,"The sirens, the pain, the fear, all... strangling Hell's Kitchen."
00:40:18.999,00:40:21.961,"For years, I buried my head and turned away."
00:40:22.795,00:40:24.254,Then one night...
00:40:25.130,00:40:27.633,right after we quit Landman and Zack...
00:40:28.759,00:40:31.637,-I heard it. -Heard what?
00:40:32.638,00:40:34.432,A little girl...
00:40:34.515,00:40:36.934,"crying in her bed, in a building down the block."
00:40:37.017,00:40:40.688,Her father liked to go to her room late at night...
00:40:40.771,00:40:42.272,when his wife was asleep.
00:40:43.273,00:40:44.525,"Oh, Jesus."
00:40:46.401,00:40:47.987,I called Child Services...
00:40:48.988,00:40:50.322,like you're supposed to.
00:40:51.323,00:40:53.451,"But the mom, she wouldn't believe it."
00:40:53.534,00:40:57.162,"Said it wasn't true. And the dad, he was smart."
00:40:58.498,00:41:02.668,"He made sure what he did, how he did it, didn't leave a mark."
00:41:04.086,00:41:06.631,The law couldn't do anything to help that little girl.
00:41:07.381,00:41:08.382,But I could.
00:41:10.676,00:41:12.427,I knew his routine.
00:41:14.221,00:41:16.223,Waited till he was alone.
00:41:50.257,00:41:53.468,"You touch your daughter again, and I will know."
00:42:29.171,00:42:32.382,"He spent the next month in a hospital, eating through a straw."
00:42:33.300,00:42:35.010,And I never slept better.
00:42:36.220,00:42:38.138,"You say all this, like..."
00:42:40.099,00:42:42.810,one day you'd just had it with how things are.
00:42:44.019,00:42:45.855,But to do what you do...
00:42:46.897,00:42:52.820,"you had to keep training, all those years since that Stick guy, knowing you would do something like this."
00:42:53.779,00:42:56.574,"Maybe it isn't only about justice, Matt."
00:42:56.657,00:42:59.493,Maybe it's about you having an excuse to hit someone.
00:42:59.577,00:43:01.787,Maybe you just can't stop yourself.
00:43:03.288,00:43:05.040,I don't want to stop.
00:43:16.301,00:43:17.720,You're very pretty.
00:43:18.888,00:43:20.222,Thank you.
00:43:21.556,00:43:24.101,Looks like you've got yourself an admirer.
00:43:34.987,00:43:37.322,"Only thing we have, everything said and done."
00:43:37.406,00:43:47.875,"No buildings named after us, fancy inheritances to leave behind, just... the stories those who were close to us tell to keep us alive."
00:43:49.168,00:43:51.336,Even if it's just in memory.
00:43:52.755,00:43:56.341,"Well, maybe that's enough."
00:44:02.014,00:44:06.018,"Hey, um, why don't we talk to somebody that actually lives here?"
00:44:06.101,00:44:07.269,See what it's really like.
00:44:09.772,00:44:13.067,-Let's get an attendant or somebody. -Or we could just knock.
00:44:14.860,00:44:15.861,See?
00:44:20.032,00:44:21.241,"She said, Come in."
00:44:35.339,00:44:36.631,Is it time?
00:44:37.800,00:44:41.053,-Time for what? -You know what.
00:44:43.097,00:44:46.016,You bring it before I go to bed every night.
00:44:47.101,00:44:48.102,Oh.
00:44:48.602,00:44:51.105,"-I don't know you, do I? -Oh..."
00:44:51.188,00:44:55.484,"Uh, no. We... uh, we just..."
00:44:55.567,00:44:58.738,We wanted to ask you some questions.
00:44:58.821,00:45:02.657,About how you like it at Saint Benezet.
00:45:06.912,00:45:09.832,-How long have you been here? -A while now.
00:45:11.250,00:45:12.960,Ever since my husband passed.
00:45:14.920,00:45:15.963,Are you two married?
00:45:17.297,00:45:19.049,No.
00:45:19.133,00:45:22.928,"-Well, I am, but not to her. -No, I'm single."
00:45:24.596,00:45:26.265,"Uh, Mrs. Vistain..."
00:45:26.891,00:45:28.433,Is it time?
00:45:29.101,00:45:30.144,Uh...
00:45:30.227,00:45:31.478,"We're sorry to bother you, ma'am."
00:45:32.938,00:45:36.233,"Mrs. Vistain, um, your husband..."
00:45:36.316,00:45:39.653,-Was that your first marriage? -Arthur?
00:45:40.863,00:45:44.116,"Lord, no, he was my third."
00:45:44.199,00:45:47.077,"Kept his name, thought it sounded like royalty."
00:45:47.661,00:45:48.954,I always loved that.
00:45:49.038,00:45:51.665,Martin was my second.
00:45:54.794,00:45:56.295,But confused...
00:45:57.671,00:45:59.048,by other men.
00:46:00.174,00:46:01.842,"Oh, um..."
00:46:01.926,00:46:04.553,Your first marriage... who was that to?
00:46:05.846,00:46:10.893,"He tried so hard, but... he drank, you know."
00:46:12.394,00:46:13.687,I didn't.
00:46:14.855,00:46:17.858,"Never touched a drop. Not once, no."
00:46:20.444,00:46:24.573,"And, uh... did you have any children with your first husband?"
00:46:24.656,00:46:27.409,-Karen-- -Just... let her answer.
00:46:28.452,00:46:29.661,Mrs. Vistain?
00:46:30.579,00:46:32.039,He's such a good boy.
00:46:34.875,00:46:37.044,Comes to see me every weekend.
00:46:43.133,00:46:45.052,Not like his father.
00:46:45.135,00:46:48.305,And what's his name? Your son?
00:46:51.058,00:46:52.434,Wilson.
00:46:53.268,00:46:54.269,Fisk?
00:46:57.982,00:46:59.358,Wilson Fisk?
00:47:00.525,00:47:02.652,I haven't used that name since...
00:47:03.820,00:47:05.572,It wasn't his fault.
00:47:07.699,00:47:14.456,"His father, he was-- Wilson... just wanted him to stop."
00:47:15.749,00:47:17.709,"It wasn't his fault, what he did."
00:47:19.169,00:47:21.588,"Mrs. Vistain, what did your son do?"
00:47:24.174,00:47:38.981,"There are those that question why a man such as myself, a man who treasures his privacy, would willingly subject himself to the public eye."
00:47:41.650,00:47:51.576,"I question the man who wouldn't step forward when his city, his heart, is in such a time of need."
00:47:51.660,00:47:52.786,With your help...
00:47:54.163,00:47:56.831,we can ensure that everyone...
00:47:57.666,00:48:07.134,"that was affected by the recent attacks, and all who call Hell's Kitchen their home, will see a brighter day."
00:48:07.217,00:48:10.887,"I thank you, and please enjoy your evening."
00:48:20.439,00:48:22.524,That was beautiful.
00:48:22.607,00:48:25.319,That word is meant for only you tonight.
00:48:29.489,00:48:32.492,"-Thank you for coming. Thank you so much. -Of course, thank you."
00:48:32.576,00:48:34.161,-It's a pleasure to see you again. -Nice to see you.
00:48:36.455,00:48:38.165,Thank you so much for the donation.
00:48:38.248,00:48:40.459,"It means the world to me, and to my organization."
00:48:40.542,00:48:41.626,"Yeah, mmm-hmm."
00:48:45.630,00:48:49.759,I haven't been in a room with so many deep pockets since the junk bond days.
00:48:49.843,00:48:52.554,"Leland, I was starting to worry."
00:48:54.389,00:48:56.058,Appreciate it.
00:48:56.141,00:48:57.559,"Yeah, great."
00:48:57.642,00:49:01.146,"So, does anybody need a drink as bad as I do?"
00:49:04.733,00:49:07.611,"It was a hell of a speech, Fisk. You ever think about running for office?"
00:49:07.694,00:49:09.989,"I'll leave that to people like you, Senator."
00:49:12.032,00:49:15.160,"You, um... got a minute to talk about that zoning issue?"
00:49:15.244,00:49:16.620,"Yes, of course."
00:49:17.829,00:49:19.831,I'll be back in a minute.
00:49:23.752,00:49:25.545,I didn't vote for Senator Cherryh last election.
00:49:26.921,00:49:28.673,Few people did.
00:49:30.509,00:49:36.973,"He said it was because of the advice he got from Van Lunt and his crackpot astrologer, if you can believe that."
00:49:37.057,00:49:38.808,Van Lunt?
00:49:38.892,00:49:42.104,"Yeah, he's the guy who... owns this mausoleum."
00:49:42.187,00:49:47.734,"Ask me, has more to do with Cherryh having his fingers in all the right holes."
00:49:52.406,00:49:53.698,Somebody can't hold his liquor.
00:49:56.785,00:49:57.786,What the hell is this?
00:50:03.750,00:50:06.670,"Wesley, get the car. We need to leave... now."
00:50:09.589,00:50:10.882,Vanessa!
00:50:16.430,00:50:17.722,Somebody get a doctor!
00:50:19.141,00:50:20.392,Vanessa?
00:50:26.856,00:50:28.358,Vanessa!
00:50:31.278,00:50:32.487,Vanessa!
00:50:39.286,00:50:41.955,"You're going to get yourself killed, you keep this up."
00:50:42.038,00:50:43.582,"You know that, right?"
00:50:45.500,00:50:46.960,I can take care of myself.
00:50:48.503,00:50:49.963,What about the rest of us?
00:50:51.005,00:50:53.383,"Me, Karen..."
00:50:53.467,00:50:56.261,"we're a part of this now, because of you."
00:50:56.345,00:50:58.222,And we didn't get a say in that.
00:50:58.305,00:51:01.641,"What do you think's gonna happen if I give up now, Foggy?"
00:51:01.725,00:51:04.936,"-Who's going to stop Fisk? -Oh, I don't know... the law?"
00:51:05.019,00:51:06.521,Tell that to Elena.
00:51:08.315,00:51:12.861,If you could have put on a mask and prevented what happened to her...
00:51:15.780,00:51:17.532,We don't live in a world that's fair.
00:51:17.616,00:51:19.409,We live in this one.
00:51:19.493,00:51:22.246,And I'm doing everything I can to make it a better place.
00:51:22.329,00:51:23.872,A better place.
00:51:28.084,00:51:30.170,That kind of sounds like what Fisk keeps saying.
00:51:30.254,00:51:31.963,Don't say that. Don't twist it around.
00:51:32.046,00:51:35.717,"You tried to kill him, Matt. You told me yourself."
00:51:35.800,00:51:38.762,How is that any different than the way he solves his problems?
00:51:38.845,00:51:41.181,I made a mistake. I know that.
00:51:42.141,00:51:44.726,Misspelling Hanukkah is a mistake.
00:51:45.894,00:51:48.147,Attempted murder is a little something else.
00:51:48.938,00:51:53.152,You ever stop to think what would happen if you went to jail? Or worse?
00:51:53.943,00:51:56.988,You really think that anyone would believe that I didn't know what you were doing?
00:51:59.366,00:52:02.661,"This city needs me in that mask, Foggy."
00:52:03.620,00:52:04.704,Maybe you're right.
00:52:07.081,00:52:08.667,Maybe it does.
00:52:09.709,00:52:11.085,But I don't.
00:52:13.046,00:52:15.715,I only ever needed my friend.
00:52:18.843,00:52:22.181,"I wouldn't have kept this from you, Matt. Not from you."
00:52:22.264,00:52:25.058,You don't know that. You don't know that.
00:52:25.141,00:52:28.478,"Yeah, I do."
00:52:32.691,00:52:35.026,Foggy... wait.
00:52:36.195,00:52:37.321,Foggy.
00:52:51.793,00:52:54.713,"-Foggy, I'm fine. -Don't look fine."
00:52:56.298,00:53:00.219,-I wouldn't go that far. -Gotta be more careful.
00:53:00.302,00:53:02.011,I know. I know.
00:53:02.095,00:53:04.889,Tripping and falling taking out the trash.
00:53:05.807,00:53:07.100,You got to get someone to do that for you.
00:53:07.183,00:53:09.603,"Come on, I just need to be more careful, like you said."
00:53:11.187,00:53:12.689,Done!
00:53:12.772,00:53:15.692,Run your feelers over this little beauty.
00:53:15.775,00:53:17.402,"What is it, a napkin?"
00:53:17.486,00:53:20.447,"No, my friend, this is our future."
00:53:20.530,00:53:23.825,"-Huh, feels like a napkin. -It's a drawing of a sign."
00:53:24.618,00:53:27.621,"Nelson and Murdock, Attorneys At Law."
00:53:30.249,00:53:33.418,"You, uh... You really want to do this?"
00:53:33.502,00:53:36.880,"No, I'm pissing my pants. There is actual urine in my trousers."
00:53:39.508,00:53:41.635,But I trust you.
00:53:41.718,00:53:44.137,You think this is what we should be doing...
00:53:44.220,00:53:45.389,then I'm with you.
00:53:46.431,00:53:47.599,For better or worse.
00:53:47.682,00:53:50.059,Sounds like we're getting married.
00:53:50.143,00:53:52.646,This is way more important than a civil union!
00:53:52.729,00:53:54.606,"Come on, we're gonna be business partners."
00:53:54.689,00:53:56.232,We're gonna share everything with each other.
00:53:56.316,00:54:00.111,"Our thoughts, our dreams, bills, crushing debt..."
00:54:01.821,00:54:05.409,"There is no one I'd rather be doing this with, buddy. Seriously."
00:54:05.492,00:54:07.118,"Me, too, pal."
00:54:08.077,00:54:11.748,"Now raise your damn glass, 'cause I'm gonna clink the hell out of it."
00:54:12.666,00:54:14.876,"Nelson and Murdock, Attorneys at Law."
00:54:14.959,00:54:16.711,Nelson and Murdock.
00:00:31.406,00:00:33.366,We need a doctor! Now!
00:00:34.117,00:00:35.327,Let's get a gurney out here!
00:00:36.244,00:00:37.954,-What happened? -She drank something.
00:00:38.038,00:00:39.539,What did she ingest? I need you to be specific.
00:00:42.792,00:00:43.835,There were others...
00:00:43.918,00:00:46.879,"Uh, I had a glass in my hand. Do I need to be checked out?"
00:00:49.841,00:00:51.050,Place is a rat hole.
00:00:51.134,00:00:52.344,It was the closest ER.
00:00:52.427,00:00:54.137,I reached out to Dr. Rosenberg.
00:00:54.221,00:00:55.472,He's on the jet.
00:00:56.639,00:00:57.640,"I need an intubation tray, stat!"
00:00:57.724,00:01:00.977,"Let's start 1,000 cc's of Ringer's lactate to KVO until we know what's going on."
00:01:04.564,00:01:09.111,"-Hemodialysis and gastric lavage? -I need a tox screen, liver and kidney function, coagulation tests."
00:01:09.194,00:01:10.195,I'll call ICU for a bed.
00:01:10.278,00:01:11.404,"You said there were others, how many?"
00:01:11.488,00:01:14.116,"Uh, four or five maybe."
00:01:14.199,00:01:17.119,Are you sure someone shouldn't be looking at me?
00:01:17.202,00:01:18.578,We'll have a nurse come check you out.
00:01:18.661,00:01:20.955,"-I'm coming with her. -I'm sorry, we can't have you in there, sir."
00:01:22.790,00:01:24.167,Fill out the paperwork.
00:02:41.369,00:02:43.621,"Matt, it's Karen."
00:02:45.623,00:02:47.375,"Come on, open the door."
00:02:48.335,00:02:51.463,I can't get a hold of Foggy and there's nobody at the office.
00:02:51.546,00:02:52.880,What the hell is going on?
00:02:55.800,00:02:57.427,Matt...
00:03:03.350,00:03:04.601,"Oh, my God."
00:03:07.270,00:03:08.938,You look like shit.
00:03:10.315,00:03:12.817,Then I'm looking better than I feel.
00:03:15.695,00:03:16.988,We gonna sue?
00:03:19.949,00:03:21.826,We should sue.
00:03:27.540,00:03:28.750,What kind of car was it?
00:03:36.090,00:03:37.675,and it was my fault.
00:03:37.759,00:03:40.637,"I, uh... should have been more careful."
00:03:40.720,00:03:42.597,What the hell happened in here?
00:03:43.223,00:03:44.724,"Nothing, don't worry about it."
00:03:44.807,00:03:47.101,"Oh, okay, I'll just, uh..."
00:03:50.272,00:03:51.898,"Little early for beer, isn't it?"
00:03:55.568,00:03:56.861,"You, uh... you want one?"
00:03:57.487,00:03:59.196,"Uh, no. No, thanks."
00:03:59.281,00:04:01.032,So where were you...
00:04:01.115,00:04:02.867,when this car hit you?
00:04:04.577,00:04:05.578,"Uh, does it matter?"
00:04:07.121,00:04:09.081,I'm thinking it might...
00:04:10.124,00:04:11.459,if there really wasn't any car.
00:04:17.924,00:04:18.925,"I told you, it was my fault."
00:04:19.008,00:04:20.760,"-Let's just leave it at that, okay? -No."
00:04:20.843,00:04:23.805,"No, not okay. Definitely not okay."
00:04:24.722,00:04:25.723,Look at you.
00:04:26.891,00:04:28.560,-Did somebody break in? -No one broke in.
00:04:28.643,00:04:31.604,"And no one beat the crap out of you either, I'm guessing."
00:04:37.360,00:04:40.029,Do you remember the last time that I was here?
00:04:40.947,00:04:42.407,"Yeah, I remember."
00:04:42.490,00:04:44.951,And I was scared... terrified.
00:04:45.034,00:04:47.078,"But then, you, you gave me your shirt..."
00:04:47.161,00:04:48.162,and you made me feel safe.
00:04:48.245,00:04:51.708,You made me feel like I could trust everything that you said.
00:04:52.249,00:04:53.460,And you lied to me...
00:05:01.801,00:05:04.762,"like Daniel Fisher, because of what I was doing."
00:05:09.559,00:05:10.602,So that's it.
00:05:11.686,00:05:12.812,That's all you're giving me.
00:05:12.895,00:05:15.357,"That's all that I have right now, Karen."
00:05:17.900,00:05:19.110,"Well, it's not all I have."
00:05:20.862,00:05:22.655,I found something.
00:05:22.739,00:05:26.659,Just a scrap of paper at the county clerk's office... misfiled.
00:05:27.869,00:05:30.997,It's probably why Fisk didn't get it sucked into a black hole.
00:05:31.080,00:05:32.289,What was it?
00:05:32.374,00:05:33.916,A marriage certificate...
00:05:35.042,00:05:37.420,"for his mother, Marlene."
00:05:37.504,00:05:38.505,How does that help?
00:05:38.588,00:05:40.131,Because it's not to his father.
00:05:40.214,00:05:42.759,It's for when she remarried...
00:05:42.842,00:05:45.720,which was two years after all the reports say she died.
00:05:45.803,00:05:47.013,She's still alive?
00:05:47.096,00:05:49.348,"Yeah, she's living at a care facility upstate."
00:05:49.432,00:05:53.603,"Now, Ben and I took a drive-- Oh, Karen, Karen..."
00:05:53.686,00:05:56.313,-Fisk could have people watching. -I know.
00:05:56.398,00:06:00.985,-I know. I didn't leave my real name. -You should have-- You should have talked to me or Foggy before you ran off like that.
00:06:07.283,00:06:10.161,"-Did you speak to her, Fisk's mother? -Yeah..."
00:06:10.244,00:06:13.080,"she's not all there, but..."
00:06:13.164,00:06:15.417,"Matt, what she said about Fisk..."
00:06:17.293,00:06:18.836,he killed his father...
00:06:20.212,00:06:21.255,when he was 12.
00:06:22.632,00:06:26.428,"Bashed his head in with a hammer, and then she helped him cover it up."
00:06:29.847,00:06:32.600,"Well, he was a minor. It's not gonna be enough."
00:06:32.684,00:06:34.852,"To put him in jail, no."
00:06:34.936,00:06:37.855,But it doesn't line up with everything that Fisk has been saying.
00:06:37.939,00:06:42.234,Everything that he has altered on the Internet and at the... the county clerk's.
00:06:42.318,00:06:45.196,It might be enough to at least get people looking at him more closely.
00:06:45.279,00:06:47.239,From an old woman who's not all there.
00:06:48.658,00:06:50.827,"Well, I'm not hearing you and Foggy come up with anything better."
00:06:51.786,00:06:53.913,Did you... did you speak to him...
00:06:53.996,00:06:55.665,to Foggy?
00:06:55.748,00:06:58.960,Not since yesterday on the phone when I guess he was...
00:06:59.043,00:07:02.129,covering for whatever it is you're not telling me.
00:07:04.006,00:07:07.218,"All right, go to the office and... wait for him."
00:07:07.301,00:07:11.681,"Tell him what you found, and Karen, tell him... tell him that I said..."
00:07:14.767,00:07:17.520,"No, don't bother. Just tell him what you found."
00:07:18.605,00:07:21.107,"Karen, be careful, please."
00:07:29.866,00:07:31.158,You know...
00:07:34.203,00:07:35.913,maybe you should take your own advice.
00:07:39.416,00:07:41.544,I... I got you a...
00:07:48.676,00:07:50.052,"It's, um..."
00:07:51.428,00:07:53.139,"it's a balloon. I, um..."
00:08:27.590,00:08:31.010,"You're not in the woods. Grunts don't count as words, Foggy Bear."
00:08:31.093,00:08:32.219,Please don't call me that.
00:08:32.303,00:08:34.556,I'll call you whatever I damn well please.
00:08:34.639,00:08:35.640,"Okay, just..."
00:08:36.558,00:08:39.101,"can you do it with your inside voice, without speaking?"
00:08:39.852,00:08:42.313,That's a very asshole thing to say.
00:08:42.396,00:08:43.815,-I'm impressed. -Sorry.
00:08:45.942,00:08:47.694,You going to work or what?
00:08:47.777,00:08:50.487,"Not today. Maybe never, not with Matt."
00:08:52.489,00:08:55.868,You two have been friends as long as I've known you.
00:08:56.869,00:09:00.039,Whatever's going on between the two of you...
00:09:00.122,00:09:01.498,I don't really care...
00:09:01.583,00:09:03.000,okay?
00:09:03.084,00:09:04.501,Not gonna get sucked into the drama.
00:09:05.753,00:09:06.921,Mmm.
00:09:08.339,00:09:09.924,Lock the door behind you when you leave.
00:09:40.079,00:09:41.914,How's he gonna run things?
00:09:43.332,00:09:45.126,"Not the time, Leland."
00:09:45.209,00:09:47.962,This is exactly the time.
00:09:48.045,00:09:49.088,You keeping score here?
00:09:49.171,00:09:53.635,You think whoever did this was trying to take little miss hairdo out of the equation?
00:09:53.718,00:09:57.429,That-- That does seem unlikely.
00:09:57.513,00:09:58.681,So where does that put us?
00:09:58.765,00:10:01.100,"They almost got me, God damn it."
00:10:01.183,00:10:04.436,"All to get to the big guy, Christ."
00:10:06.105,00:10:10.276,Did Gao give any indication she was still unhappy when you spoke with her?
00:10:11.568,00:10:13.613,Not that I could tell.
00:10:13.696,00:10:15.197,My money's on the Japanese.
00:10:15.281,00:10:22.872,"After what he did to Nobu-- The titles for all the buildings in the city block the Japanese wanted have been transferred to them, per our original agreement."
00:10:22.955,00:10:24.498,As for Nobu...
00:10:24.581,00:10:28.085,they believe the man in the mask was responsible for his... accident.
00:10:28.169,00:10:31.380,"Right, sure. Well..."
00:10:31.463,00:10:34.884,maybe he's the one who slipped a hot dose into Vanessa's Bellini.
00:10:36.177,00:10:38.846,Keep an eye on their accounts.
00:10:38.930,00:10:42.767,"If there are any sudden shifts, it might tell us something."
00:10:42.850,00:10:43.851,Yeah?
00:10:49.231,00:10:51.317,"Thank you, Francis."
00:10:56.072,00:10:58.240,"No, but..."
00:10:58.324,00:11:02.662,three of the others who drank whatever that was have... passed.
00:11:02.745,00:11:03.955,Passed...
00:11:04.872,00:11:06.498,always hated that description.
00:11:07.291,00:11:10.962,Such a sad attempt to avoid the bare-knuckle truth.
00:11:12.922,00:11:14.423,She'll make it.
00:11:15.674,00:11:18.094,You got a med degree in your pocket I don't know about?
00:11:18.177,00:11:19.511,Why are you so sure?
00:11:19.595,00:11:21.347,Because she has to.
00:11:22.598,00:11:24.558,Don't get all weepy...
00:11:31.648,00:11:32.691,Reach out to Gao.
00:11:32.775,00:11:34.777,-Me? -Mmm.
00:11:34.861,00:11:36.946,What if she's the one who did all this?
00:11:37.029,00:11:38.655,"Well, you said you didn't think it was her."
00:11:38.740,00:11:40.532,What the hell do I know?
00:11:40.616,00:11:43.119,I was almost poisoned. I'm not thinking straight.
00:11:43.202,00:11:45.621,Speak with Gao...
00:11:45.704,00:11:51.377,"if she wasn't involved, we might need her support against further unpleasantries."
00:11:52.628,00:11:54.839,And if she was involved?
00:11:54.922,00:11:58.134,Then it's been an honor doing business with you.
00:12:06.100,00:12:08.811,-You talking about the stitches? -Mostly.
00:12:09.896,00:12:11.355,How'd you open this up again?
00:12:11.438,00:12:13.816,I just wanted to see how much I could move.
00:12:18.279,00:12:22.033,You really need to rest. Let yourself heal.
00:12:22.116,00:12:23.242,I meditate for that.
00:12:23.325,00:12:24.576,You meditate?
00:12:26.703,00:12:30.374,Helps with the pain... and healing faster.
00:12:32.919,00:12:35.087,Or I'm just a contrary son of a bitch.
00:12:35.171,00:12:39.591,"Either way, you really need to ease up, or I'll be stitching a corpse next time around."
00:12:40.551,00:12:44.680,"You really should get some kind of... body armor, like I told you."
00:12:44.763,00:12:48.142,"-Yeah, I'm thinking you might be right. -There's a first."
00:12:48.225,00:12:52.396,"When Fisk came at me in the warehouse, I sliced his jacket open."
00:12:52.479,00:12:54.356,-You cut him? -No...
00:12:54.440,00:12:57.401,he was wearing some kind of armor in the lining.
00:12:58.194,00:13:00.154,"It was, uh..."
00:13:00.237,00:13:02.824,light and tough.
00:13:02.907,00:13:05.701,Like nothing I've ever come across before.
00:13:05.784,00:13:09.246,That's what you get when you have all the money in the world.
00:13:14.251,00:13:15.419,"Hey, you want a drink or something?"
00:13:17.839,00:13:19.173,"No, Matt..."
00:13:20.382,00:13:21.758,I don't want a drink.
00:13:23.260,00:13:25.096,Second woman today that's turned me down.
00:13:25.721,00:13:27.598,"Got a revolving door, do you?"
00:13:27.681,00:13:30.559,That's not... not what-- -I didn't mean it... -Forget it.
00:13:30.642,00:13:33.938,I have to get going. I need to pack.
00:13:34.021,00:13:36.148,-Pack? -Yeah.
00:13:36.232,00:13:37.942,Taking some time off...
00:13:39.193,00:13:40.903,get out of the city for a while.
00:13:43.197,00:13:44.448,Why?
00:13:45.908,00:13:47.618,You gonna miss me?
00:13:50.872,00:13:52.289,And if I said I would?
00:14:04.969,00:14:08.180,I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again...
00:14:09.640,00:14:10.724,not alive.
00:14:10.807,00:14:13.978,Not after that last call the night half the city blew up.
00:14:14.061,00:14:15.271,I left you a message when...
00:14:16.105,00:14:17.481,when it was over.
00:14:19.816,00:14:21.861,"Come on, what'd you expect, Claire?"
00:14:23.029,00:14:27.033,You made it pretty clear you didn't want to move forward with...
00:14:27.116,00:14:28.117,whatever this was.
00:14:28.200,00:14:29.994,You know what it was...
00:14:31.328,00:14:33.080,-what it could've been. -If I stopped.
00:14:33.164,00:14:34.957,"I'm not looking to go around in circles, Matt."
00:14:35.041,00:14:37.251,I know you're not going to stop.
00:14:38.961,00:14:42.631,Not until this city is safe from people like Fisk.
00:14:42.714,00:14:44.133,Which is never.
00:14:45.509,00:14:49.138,"It'll always be something, someone..."
00:14:49.931,00:14:51.640,"you know that, right?"
00:14:55.436,00:14:58.898,You told me you were the man this city needs.
00:14:58.981,00:15:01.525,I think that was only half true.
00:15:04.653,00:15:07.031,I think you're also the man this city created...
00:15:09.325,00:15:11.202,for better or worse.
00:15:13.620,00:15:15.789,I'm sorry you got pulled back into this.
00:15:18.500,00:15:21.921,At least I got to see you with your shirt off again.
00:15:23.714,00:15:24.881,...it's not all bad.
00:15:26.258,00:15:27.384,"Thank you, Claire."
00:15:33.057,00:15:34.141,thank you.
00:15:35.726,00:15:37.478,I'll always be there...
00:15:39.021,00:15:41.107,when you really need me...
00:15:41.190,00:15:42.774,to patch you up.
00:15:44.401,00:15:45.987,Beyond that...
00:15:47.279,00:15:48.322,Yeah.
00:15:49.281,00:15:50.574,Yeah.
00:15:58.332,00:16:02.419,"You know, the only thing I remember from Sunday school..."
00:16:03.879,00:16:05.589,is the martyrs...
00:16:06.757,00:16:09.010,"the saints, the saviors..."
00:16:09.760,00:16:12.346,they all end up the same way.
00:16:13.930,00:16:15.975,Bloody...
00:16:16.058,00:16:17.643,and alone.
00:16:18.477,00:16:20.437,I never said I was any of those.
00:16:22.523,00:16:24.191,You didn't have to.
00:16:41.708,00:16:43.419,You still mad?
00:16:44.545,00:16:46.130,What do you think?
00:16:48.257,00:16:51.968,"I'm sorry, Ben, I needed you-- You know who needs me, Karen?"
00:16:52.886,00:16:54.221,My wife...
00:16:55.597,00:16:56.598,she needs me.
00:16:58.350,00:17:00.477,-It was important. -You could've just told me...
00:17:00.561,00:17:05.941,"but no, instead you gotta spin some story about this great place upstate..."
00:17:06.025,00:17:07.984,could be good for Doris.
00:17:08.069,00:17:09.653,Like you give a damn.
00:17:11.447,00:17:12.698,"Hey, that's not fair."
00:17:15.242,00:17:16.618,Welcome to my life.
00:17:16.702,00:17:18.662,"Wait, you're right."
00:17:18.745,00:17:20.247,You're right. I should've told you.
00:17:20.331,00:17:22.124,Then why didn't you?
00:17:22.208,00:17:23.542,I...
00:17:24.543,00:17:25.877,was afraid you'd say no.
00:17:27.504,00:17:28.755,Probably would've.
00:17:28.839,00:17:30.674,This isn't a story.
00:17:33.094,00:17:36.097,"And what Fisk has been doing, the person that he really is..."
00:17:36.180,00:17:40.351,We finally have the smoking gun or... or whatever.
00:17:40.434,00:17:42.144,More a whatever than a gun.
00:17:42.936,00:17:44.771,You need to print this.
00:17:44.855,00:17:46.815,Get it out there for everyone to see.
00:17:48.609,00:17:51.195,"Fisk killed his father, people need to know that."
00:17:51.945,00:17:54.240,She's an old lady...
00:17:56.075,00:17:59.370,talking about things that... maybe happened a long time ago.
00:17:59.453,00:18:01.122,So you don't believe her?
00:18:01.205,00:18:02.414,Okay...
00:18:04.208,00:18:05.251,let's play this out.
00:18:09.296,00:18:10.714,So I write up the story...
00:18:11.757,00:18:13.092,get it on the front page.
00:18:13.175,00:18:14.885,Then what happens?
00:18:14.968,00:18:17.846,"Well, everybody will see that he's been lying about his past."
00:18:17.929,00:18:21.975,"Yeah, sure, absolutely will."
00:18:22.058,00:18:30.651,"Then he goes on TV again, tells everybody, yes, he lied about his past because he was just a scared little kid trying to protect his mother."
00:18:30.734,00:18:35.281,"Maybe he even rolls the old girl out, gets all teary-eyed."
00:18:35.364,00:18:36.448,See where I'm going with this?
00:18:36.532,00:18:38.367,Sounds like you're going nowhere.
00:18:38.450,00:18:40.369,"Need to think this through, all I'm saying."
00:18:41.412,00:18:43.372,He's gonna win.
00:18:43.455,00:18:45.291,"If we don't do something, Fisk is gonna win."
00:18:45.374,00:18:48.294,There are no winners and losers in something like this.
00:18:48.377,00:18:51.130,"Well, Elena Cardenas might disagree with you..."
00:18:51.213,00:18:53.089,if she still could.
00:18:58.929,00:19:00.472,Maybe we don't have to do anything.
00:19:02.308,00:19:03.559,What does that mean?
00:19:03.642,00:19:07.062,Hear about the benefit the other night at the old Van Lunt building?
00:19:09.565,00:19:12.359,"Yeah, a bunch of one-percenters jerking each other off."
00:19:12.443,00:19:15.571,"Though, I read they all got food poisoning."
00:19:15.654,00:19:17.989,Don't think it was bad hors d'oeuvres.
00:19:18.073,00:19:21.535,"Got an unconfirmed source, says..."
00:19:21.618,00:19:23.495,it was something in the drinks.
00:19:23.579,00:19:25.121,Maybe even a couple fatalities.
00:19:26.081,00:19:27.374,Holy shit.
00:19:28.709,00:19:30.836,Why isn't this all over the news?
00:19:30.919,00:19:33.088,"Fisk spinning it, I guess."
00:19:33.172,00:19:35.382,Which means he's got a lot of pull in the media.
00:19:35.466,00:19:37.092,"Maybe even at the Bulletin, I don't know."
00:19:37.801,00:19:39.803,"Wait, uh, back up."
00:19:39.886,00:19:42.097,"If this is true, why would someone attack a benefit?"
00:19:42.181,00:19:44.725,Fisk made himself public.
00:19:44.808,00:19:48.937,People who he's connected with might be less inclined to be dragged out of the shadows.
00:19:49.730,00:19:51.565,You think someone's trying to kill Fisk?
00:19:51.648,00:19:55.736,I've been writing about crime in this city since before you were born.
00:19:55.819,00:19:57.863,The only thing I know without a doubt...
00:19:58.822,00:20:05.621,is you don't get to be the man at the top without making enemies looking to tear you down to the ground.
00:20:18.634,00:20:19.676,No.
00:20:27.142,00:20:28.894,There was a time when I...
00:20:30.396,00:20:32.231,I believed that I was complete...
00:20:34.065,00:20:39.112,that I needed no one to truly... understand who I am.
00:20:47.246,00:20:52.751,"If she dies-- Rosenberg's in from Hartford, and she's strong."
00:20:52.834,00:20:55.003,-We've all seen that. -Yes.
00:20:58.382,00:20:59.800,Leland thinks...
00:21:00.801,00:21:02.886,it might have been Nobu's men.
00:21:04.846,00:21:05.931,Fate.
00:21:07.974,00:21:10.269,-Sir? -It was something Gao said to me.
00:21:10.352,00:21:15.982,I had to choose a path or fate would choose for me.
00:21:17.108,00:21:19.653,I sent Leland to speak with her.
00:21:19.736,00:21:21.780,You suspect her hand in this?
00:21:24.658,00:21:27.453,"Until we know for certain, I suspect everyone."
00:21:29.996,00:21:31.332,You need to find who did this.
00:21:33.041,00:21:34.167,You need to.
00:21:35.085,00:21:39.548,I want to look in their eyes when I salt the earth with their blood.
00:21:42.676,00:21:43.885,Understood.
00:21:45.762,00:21:48.599,I told her the safest place she could ever be was by my side.
00:21:48.682,00:21:49.683,This wasn't your fault.
00:21:49.766,00:21:52.353,"Well, she's lying in there because she was by my side."
00:21:57.733,00:21:59.318,We'll make the arrangements.
00:22:00.361,00:22:03.572,"If she recovers, I want her sent away."
00:22:04.114,00:22:07.368,Somewhere far from me... and the city.
00:22:07.451,00:22:10.120,I... doubt she would want that.
00:22:10.203,00:22:12.748,"Well, we seldom get everything we want..."
00:22:12.831,00:22:14.458,not in this world.
00:22:15.334,00:22:17.168,But...
00:22:17.252,00:22:19.170,some of us deserve to.
00:22:28.389,00:22:29.598,I'll have Leland attend to it.
00:22:29.681,00:22:32.726,"No, no, I want it done quietly. Handle it yourself."
00:22:34.728,00:22:37.105,I'll have the papers messengered to your penthouse.
00:22:37.188,00:22:39.691,"-Thank you, Wesley. -Mmm."
00:22:45.864,00:22:47.198,I...
00:22:54.540,00:22:56.500,Thank you.
00:23:10.931,00:23:12.223,Is she gonna make it?
00:23:12.307,00:23:15.310,She's in an induced coma now. She's gonna pull through.
00:23:15.393,00:23:16.437,She'll pull through.
00:23:16.520,00:23:18.814,"Thank you, Doctor. Thank you so much."
00:23:44.465,00:23:47.342,Morning service was hours ago.
00:23:47.425,00:23:48.885,I know.
00:23:50.095,00:23:51.429,Confession?
00:23:54.182,00:23:55.183,Latte?
00:23:56.226,00:23:57.561,"Not today, Father."
00:23:57.644,00:24:01.231,"Probably for the best, already had four cups."
00:24:01.314,00:24:03.191,Decaf.
00:24:03.274,00:24:06.361,But you know there's still a bit of caffeine in there they just can't get out.
00:24:07.112,00:24:09.990,"Some things are just... too ingrained, I guess."
00:24:11.575,00:24:12.868,That thing...
00:24:14.870,00:24:16.329,brought you here last time...
00:24:17.664,00:24:19.750,didn't go so well?
00:24:19.833,00:24:21.209,Not so much.
00:24:22.586,00:24:24.588,The man...
00:24:24.671,00:24:25.714,you talked of...
00:24:26.632,00:24:27.841,did you...
00:24:27.924,00:24:29.342,"No, I didn't kill him."
00:24:32.513,00:24:33.930,But I tried to.
00:24:35.516,00:24:38.685,And are you disappointed that you didn't succeed...
00:24:39.770,00:24:41.312,or maybe a little relieved?
00:24:44.525,00:24:48.319,A friend of mine says that if I don't change the way I do things...
00:24:51.865,00:24:54.535,I will end up bloody and alone.
00:24:54.618,00:24:55.786,You believe that?
00:24:58.079,00:24:59.581,I'm not afraid of dying.
00:25:00.999,00:25:04.460,"Lot of people aren't, comes right down to it."
00:25:04.545,00:25:07.005,It's living scares the holy crap out of 'em.
00:25:10.551,00:25:12.010,You know what I do?
00:25:13.679,00:25:15.013,Who I am?
00:25:24.815,00:25:27.150,-Don't have to worry about-- -It's not what I'm asking.
00:25:29.110,00:25:30.779,"Yes, Matthew, I'm not an idiot."
00:25:30.862,00:25:33.489,I have a pretty good idea who you are...
00:25:36.367,00:25:38.161,How you do it...
00:25:39.370,00:25:41.456,...that's something else entirely.
00:25:41.539,00:25:42.583,Accident...
00:25:42.666,00:25:44.626,when I was a kid.
00:25:44.710,00:25:46.502,Used to think it was God's will.
00:25:46.587,00:25:47.921,Used to?
00:25:55.637,00:25:57.180,"I believe so, yes."
00:25:57.263,00:25:59.557,Then why did he put the Devil in me?
00:26:01.309,00:26:03.311,Why do I feel it in my heart...
00:26:04.270,00:26:05.731,and my soul...
00:26:07.858,00:26:10.902,clawing to be let out...
00:26:10.986,00:26:14.447,if that's not all part of God's plan?
00:26:18.159,00:26:22.914,Maybe you're being called to summon the better angels of your nature.
00:26:22.998,00:26:25.709,Maybe that's the struggle you're feeling...
00:26:25.792,00:26:26.835,deep within you.
00:26:26.918,00:26:31.214,And how do you know the angels and the Devil inside me aren't the same thing?
00:26:39.806,00:26:42.225,Maybe that was God's plan all along.
00:26:42.308,00:26:45.896,"Why he created him, allowed him to fall from grace..."
00:26:45.979,00:26:48.064,to become a symbol to be feared...
00:26:48.774,00:26:54.905,"warning to us all, to tread the path of the righteous."
00:28:44.180,00:28:45.681,I'm really not in the mood for this tonight.
00:28:46.975,00:28:49.060,"It's cool, man, it's cool."
00:28:50.729,00:28:52.147,We don't gotta do all that.
00:28:56.692,00:28:59.612,"Go for the backup piece tucked behind your belt, I throw you off the roof."
00:28:59.695,00:29:02.198,-We good? -Yeah.
00:29:02.282,00:29:05.368,"Yeah, man, we good."
00:29:13.126,00:29:14.627,"I didn't say, Get up."
00:29:14.710,00:29:17.713,What're you beating on me for? I ain't done nothin'.
00:29:17.798,00:29:20.175,It's not about you. I want information.
00:29:20.258,00:29:23.219,"What I look like, public damn library?"
00:29:24.095,00:29:26.890,"Ow! Jesus, all right!"
00:29:26.973,00:29:29.434,"What do you want to know, man? Shit."
00:29:29.517,00:29:30.518,Fisk.
00:29:30.601,00:29:33.646,"-I don't know where he is, I swear. -That's not the question."
00:29:33.729,00:29:37.275,"Fisk wears some kind of body armor... light, strong."
00:29:38.193,00:29:39.277,Where's he get it?
00:29:39.360,00:29:40.611,The hell should I know?
00:29:42.948,00:29:44.032,"Whoa, whoa!"
00:29:44.115,00:29:46.409,"Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait!"
00:29:47.243,00:29:50.080,"Body armor, body armor. Yeah, yeah."
00:29:50.914,00:29:52.874,"Yeah, body armor."
00:29:52.958,00:29:54.918,I think I might... I think I might know a guy.
00:29:56.127,00:29:57.921,Give me the name.
00:30:30.453,00:30:33.248,"Yeah, no, we're on the same page."
00:30:33.331,00:30:35.625,Let me call you-- I'll call you back.
00:30:39.880,00:30:41.006,How is she?
00:30:44.800,00:30:49.097,Rosenberg says that there may be complications.
00:30:49.180,00:30:51.432,"If that happens, we'll deal with it."
00:30:53.935,00:30:55.686,My mother called.
00:30:55.770,00:30:58.398,"Can you return, see what she needs?"
00:31:02.360,00:31:03.486,Um...
00:31:06.948,00:31:08.241,still with us?
00:31:10.076,00:31:12.495,Well... that's something.
00:31:12.578,00:31:14.289,I don't want to be disturbed.
00:31:14.372,00:31:15.373,Understood.
00:31:15.456,00:31:22.047,"I could use a minute, before you-- What am I, invisible?"
00:31:24.715,00:31:26.384,"We had a chat, yeah."
00:31:27.677,00:31:29.220,And?
00:31:29.304,00:31:30.513,And what?
00:31:30.596,00:31:36.561,She said she was deeply saddened and quoted a fortune cookie or some mystical shit.
00:31:41.942,00:31:44.194,I don't think the guy translating for her liked me very much.
00:31:44.277,00:31:47.655,He kept staring at me funny.
00:31:47.738,00:31:49.490,Funny how?
00:31:49.574,00:31:50.783,Funny!
00:31:53.161,00:31:57.082,She said she'd stand with us... if it comes to that.
00:31:59.292,00:32:01.461,"I don't know, maybe."
00:32:01.544,00:32:02.670,We need to be sure.
00:32:08.343,00:32:09.677,-He will. -When?
00:32:09.760,00:32:11.304,When he deems it appropriate.
00:32:11.387,00:32:15.183,"Well, doesn't that just fill me with confidence?"
00:32:15.266,00:32:19.145,Do you think whoever did this... just roll up the sidewalk and move on?
00:32:19.229,00:32:23.774,"If they came after him once, they'll come after him again, sooner or later."
00:32:25.026,00:32:28.947,"Go home, get some rest. We'll call if you're needed."
00:32:29.030,00:32:31.366,"Sure, I'll wait by the phone."
00:32:32.367,00:32:34.785,It's not like I have anything better to do.
00:32:49.050,00:32:52.637,"Hello, Marlene? It's Wesley."
00:32:54.347,00:32:57.725,"No, I work with your son. We've met before."
00:32:58.977,00:33:01.104,"James Wesley, that's right."
00:33:05.941,00:33:08.069,Was there something I could help you with?
00:33:14.200,00:33:15.660,"Wait, I'm sorry."
00:33:16.661,00:33:18.496,Who came to visit you?
00:35:06.020,00:35:07.772,You shouldn't be here.
00:35:12.777,00:35:14.737,You work for Fisk?
00:35:17.990,00:35:19.450,I asked you a question.
00:35:32.922,00:35:34.465,You shouldn't be here.
00:35:37.177,00:35:39.970,"No, no, it's nothing. I'll see to it, Marlene."
00:35:40.888,00:35:44.016,"Yes, I'll have him call you as soon as he's free."
00:35:57.863,00:35:59.449,I need your piece.
00:36:01.201,00:36:03.286,"Discreetly, please."
00:36:07.707,00:36:09.124,Keys.
00:36:13.671,00:36:14.797,You want I should drive you?
00:36:17.592,00:36:20.970,"No one goes in or out of that room without you checking 'em first, clear?"
00:36:21.053,00:36:22.805,"Yeah, what if he asks for you?"
00:36:22.888,00:36:24.265,Tell him I won't be long.
00:36:45.203,00:36:46.746,That wasn't very nice.
00:37:50.310,00:37:53.313,Mr. Fisk's gonna be mad.
00:37:56.816,00:37:58.276,Who-- Who's he gonna hurt?
00:38:02.363,00:38:03.614,Melvin Potter?
00:38:08.744,00:38:11.331,"Who's Fisk going to hurt, Melvin?"
00:38:18.921,00:38:20.172,Who's-- Who's Betsy?
00:38:22.216,00:38:25.553,"She's nice, she helps me..."
00:38:31.225,00:38:33.519,Why would... why would Fisk want to hurt her?
00:38:33.603,00:38:39.149,"No one's supposed to be here, in... in the shop, unless he brings them."
00:38:40.192,00:38:41.569,So you do work for Fisk.
00:38:43.654,00:38:45.990,"I said no, when he asked."
00:38:51.120,00:38:53.288,She wants me to be good. I gotta be good.
00:38:54.665,00:38:57.460,So I... I make things.
00:38:58.628,00:39:00.295,I'm good at making things.
00:39:03.383,00:39:05.760,"Fisk has hurt people that I care about, too."
00:39:05.843,00:39:07.970,I know what it's like to worry about them...
00:39:09.555,00:39:11.140,wanting to keep them safe.
00:39:11.223,00:39:13.225,"He make you work for him, too?"
00:39:13.308,00:39:15.895,"No, I don't work for Fisk."
00:39:17.146,00:39:20.608,I want to stop him from hurting anyone else...
00:39:20.691,00:39:22.151,from hurting Betsy.
00:39:24.153,00:39:26.113,-You could do that? -Maybe.
00:39:26.864,00:39:28.824,Did you make a suit for Fisk?
00:39:29.950,00:39:32.662,Did you make a suit lined with this?
00:39:32.745,00:39:36.290,Made a whole bunch. It keeps him safe.
00:39:36.374,00:39:38.584,Can you make something for me out of this?
00:39:42.880,00:39:46.341,"No. No, I want something very special."
00:39:46.426,00:39:48.428,And if you do this for me...
00:39:49.554,00:39:51.263,I promise to get Fisk out of your life...
00:39:52.765,00:39:54.349,and to keep Betsy safe.
00:39:57.144,00:39:58.604,You can do that?
00:39:58.688,00:40:00.314,"With your help, I..."
00:40:00.398,00:40:01.649,I think maybe I can.
00:40:01.732,00:40:04.276,What do you want me to make?
00:40:05.277,00:40:06.821,A symbol.
00:40:42.815,00:40:44.191,You're a dick.
00:40:45.234,00:40:47.152,The hell did I do?
00:40:50.990,00:40:52.742,I've been calling you all day.
00:40:54.034,00:40:55.285,Been busy.
00:40:56.286,00:40:58.623,-Did you even listen to my messages? -Yeah.
00:40:59.665,00:41:01.626,-And? -And what?
00:41:03.168,00:41:07.923,You got a crazy old lady with a story about a young Willie Fisk beaning his dad with a hammer.
00:41:09.925,00:41:12.094,"He was 12, 40 some years ago."
00:41:12.177,00:41:14.304,"Jesus, why don't any of you..."
00:41:16.474,00:41:18.392,His mother is supposed to be dead.
00:41:21.270,00:41:22.855,You know who we're dealing with.
00:41:23.939,00:41:25.274,It won't be enough.
00:41:27.317,00:41:28.611,You sound just like Matt.
00:41:31.363,00:41:32.907,You talked to him?
00:41:35.493,00:41:36.911,He asked the same about you.
00:41:36.994,00:41:39.622,-He did? -When I was over at his place.
00:41:40.330,00:41:42.082,What the hell happened?
00:41:42.166,00:41:45.210,And don't... don't tell me that it was a car accident.
00:41:45.294,00:41:46.879,Ask him.
00:41:46.962,00:41:49.298,-I did. -What'd he say?
00:41:49.882,00:41:51.842,Just that... it was his fault.
00:41:53.719,00:41:55.137,Got that right.
00:41:56.597,00:41:58.849,What is going on with you two?
00:42:00.810,00:42:02.978,-It's not like we have any clients. -Foggy...
00:42:15.199,00:42:17.201,Found the Nelson and Murdock sign in the trash.
00:42:18.578,00:42:20.746,A very rough patch.
00:42:22.372,00:42:23.999,You wanna talk?
00:42:25.167,00:42:26.669,Yeah...
00:42:35.177,00:42:36.929,Why?
00:42:40.683,00:42:41.976,It's...
00:42:43.352,00:42:46.021,"If you say it's complicated, I will punch you in the face."
00:42:48.566,00:42:50.442,"It's personal, okay?"
00:42:57.157,00:42:58.951,Okay...
00:42:59.034,00:43:00.535,"okay, it's personal, I get it."
00:43:09.211,00:43:11.505,They started tearing down Elena's tenement building today.
00:43:12.297,00:43:14.383,Did you know that?
00:43:14.466,00:43:17.052,"No, I didn't."
00:43:18.721,00:43:21.056,"Fisk is still out there, Foggy."
00:43:23.768,00:43:28.105,Be nice if you and Matt could get your heads out of your asses and help do something about it...
00:43:29.815,00:43:32.860,before there's nothing left of Hell's Kitchen to fight for.
00:43:39.867,00:43:44.872,"Uh, Matt, it's Karen. I just saw Foggy at Josie's. He's, um..."
00:43:46.040,00:43:48.626,Can you two please get your shit together?
00:43:48.709,00:43:52.797,"I thought we were supposed to be a team, not whatever this is, okay?"
00:43:52.880,00:43:55.507,Call me back... seriously.
00:43:57.551,00:43:58.803,Bye.
00:44:11.148,00:44:13.651,-it's Karen. -I know.
00:44:13.734,00:44:17.571,"They got this thing, caller ID, might have heard of it."
00:44:19.239,00:44:20.532,You still sound pissed.
00:44:22.117,00:44:23.493,Just tired.
00:44:25.620,00:44:27.622,You okay?
00:44:27.707,00:44:30.334,Will be. What's up?
00:44:32.336,00:44:34.797,Matt and Foggy are...
00:44:34.880,00:44:37.049,I don't know what. They had some kind of fight and now...
00:44:37.800,00:44:40.219,"I feel like it's falling apart, Ben."
00:44:41.679,00:44:42.805,All of it.
00:44:43.638,00:44:46.809,"Ah, it's usually right around the time you know the story's getting interesting."
00:44:53.607,00:44:54.859,day after day?
00:45:03.993,00:45:05.410,"You know that, right?"
00:45:06.871,00:45:08.580,We all do what we can.
00:45:09.999,00:45:11.416,Sometimes it's enough.
00:45:12.918,00:45:14.336,"Thank you, Ben."
00:45:17.089,00:45:18.548,I didn't say I was writing that story.
00:45:21.635,00:45:23.971,Just thank you for...
00:45:24.054,00:45:25.890,"for being there, for..."
00:45:30.519,00:45:31.561,"You, too."
00:45:33.688,00:45:35.065,Talk tomorrow?
00:45:35.983,00:45:39.361,"Yeah, talk tomorrow."
00:45:41.488,00:45:42.907,Okay.
00:46:18.775,00:46:20.735,"Shit, seriously?"
00:46:34.041,00:46:36.043,I don't know how to pray.
00:46:39.629,00:46:42.007,My father was not a religious man.
00:46:42.091,00:46:48.680,"My mother wanted to be... I think, needed to be, but she never quite found it within herself."
00:46:52.101,00:46:57.106,"I'd seen it in movies, and watched it on television."
00:47:02.111,00:47:04.779,And I tried to mimic words...
00:47:06.866,00:47:08.700,the sentiment...
00:47:15.374,00:47:17.501,but it was false.
00:47:24.216,00:47:25.384,So...
00:47:34.226,00:47:36.353,All I can do...
00:47:36.436,00:47:38.898,is make you a promise.
00:47:38.981,00:47:43.860,"One that not even God, if there is such a thing, can prevent me from keeping."
00:47:48.573,00:47:50.825,The people that did this to you...
00:47:51.952,00:47:53.120,they will suffer.
00:47:58.500,00:47:59.793,They will suffer.
00:48:35.370,00:48:36.663,I thought...
00:48:37.581,00:48:39.333,maybe you weren't coming out of it.
00:48:40.542,00:48:42.711,That would have been a shame.
00:48:45.965,00:48:48.717,You might wanna take a moment.
00:48:51.553,00:48:53.513,"In the meantime, I..."
00:48:53.597,00:48:55.182,I thought we could chat.
00:49:06.943,00:49:08.653,You can't do this.
00:49:11.656,00:49:14.826,"And yet, here we are."
00:49:18.955,00:49:22.959,"You know, funny story, after the Union Allied article, I..."
00:49:23.043,00:49:26.130,inquired as to whether you needed further attention.
00:49:26.213,00:49:30.384,"The feeling was you'd already done whatever damage you could, so it wasn't necessary."
00:49:30.467,00:49:32.969,You were a... nobody...
00:49:33.053,00:49:35.972,a very small cog in the machine.
00:49:36.056,00:49:39.351,"So, an offer was made through a third party."
00:49:40.269,00:49:42.312,"A legal agreement, one you signed..."
00:49:43.272,00:49:45.649,in exchange for a reasonable amount of money.
00:49:45.732,00:49:47.192,Well...
00:49:47.276,00:49:48.860,reasonable to you.
00:49:52.281,00:49:54.741,"You were supposed to go away, Miss Page."
00:49:57.869,00:49:59.954,wherever people like you fade.
00:50:00.039,00:50:02.374,But you made a choice...
00:50:03.083,00:50:06.295,and that choice has brought you here...
00:50:06.378,00:50:09.048,"on this night, at this particular moment in time."
00:50:11.300,00:50:13.302,Perhaps that's the way it was always gonna be.
00:50:13.385,00:50:15.304,Perhaps we're destined...
00:50:16.221,00:50:19.099,"to follow a path none of us can see, only..."
00:50:20.016,00:50:24.813,"vaguely sense, as it takes our hand, guiding us towards the inevitable."
00:50:25.897,00:50:27.066,Is that supposed to scare me?
00:50:30.194,00:50:31.195,"uh, this is."
00:50:48.253,00:50:49.546,Do I have your attention?
00:50:53.925,00:50:57.679,"Hello, could you, like, nod or something?"
00:51:02.601,00:51:04.436,Do you love this city?
00:51:06.271,00:51:07.272,What?
00:51:07.356,00:51:09.774,It's a simple question. Do you love this city?
00:51:10.442,00:51:11.443,I...
00:51:12.611,00:51:13.820,"I, um..."
00:51:15.822,00:51:17.241,haven't been here long enough.
00:51:17.324,00:51:18.367,Huh.
00:51:18.450,00:51:23.913,"I find a few days, a week at most, is ample time to form an emotional response."
00:51:25.081,00:51:28.042,Growing to love something is really...
00:51:28.127,00:51:31.255,simply forgetting slowly what you dislike about it.
00:51:33.507,00:51:36.885,"I'll be perfectly honest, the situation calls for it, I do not..."
00:51:38.011,00:51:39.804,love this city.
00:51:40.514,00:51:50.482,"The crush of the unwashed garbage stacked on the sidewalk, the air that seems to adhere to your skin, the layer of filth you can never completely wash away."
00:51:54.903,00:51:57.781,I'm not here because I want to be. I'm here because I'm needed.
00:51:59.241,00:52:00.284,By Fisk?
00:52:01.910,00:52:04.621,He loves this city.
00:52:06.915,00:52:08.333,I don't expect you to understand that.
00:52:08.417,00:52:12.421,"There are moments when even I struggle to, but he does..."
00:52:13.463,00:52:14.839,very deeply.
00:52:14.923,00:52:18.260,"Almost, I suspect, as much as he loves his mother."
00:52:24.599,00:52:28.312,"Frankly, I was surprised she remembered you."
00:52:30.272,00:52:34.193,Recent memories for her are fleeting gossamer...
00:52:34.276,00:52:37.987,often plucked from grasp by the slightest breeze.
00:52:38.071,00:52:41.241,"But you, you left an impression."
00:52:42.409,00:52:44.994,The nice blonde lady with the big blue eyes.
00:52:45.078,00:52:48.915,"And the man you were with, Mr. Urich, I'm guessing."
00:52:51.293,00:52:56.465,"My employer-- Sorry, old habits. Mr. Fisk..."
00:52:57.382,00:52:59.050,"as I said, loves his mother."
00:52:59.133,00:53:01.470,He would be extremely...
00:53:03.805,00:53:04.848,disturbed...
00:53:06.182,00:53:07.183,if he knew you'd found her.
00:53:07.267,00:53:08.935,Even more so that you've been to see her.
00:53:12.772,00:53:17.569,"He's preoccupied with more important matters, so I've taken it upon myself to address the situation."
00:53:20.822,00:53:22.532,If you're going to kill me...
00:53:23.908,00:53:25.244,just do it.
00:53:26.328,00:53:28.247,I'm sick of listening to your bullshit.
00:53:32.125,00:53:36.713,"I'm not here to kill you, Miss Page. I'm here to offer you a job."
00:53:46.431,00:53:48.683,"Can I get a coffee, please? Black."
00:53:50.059,00:53:51.936,"Can I get you anything to eat, sir?"
00:53:52.020,00:53:55.357,"No, thank you, Francis. Where's Wesley?"
00:53:57.651,00:54:00.362,"So, after all of this, I'm supposed to, what..."
00:54:02.656,00:54:04.366,...be your secretary?
00:54:04.449,00:54:07.327,The position I have in mind is a little more...
00:54:07.411,00:54:08.870,involved.
00:54:08.953,00:54:21.425,"You've proven yourself resourceful, tenacious, with a commendable ability to convince others that your way is the right one, the way that needs to be followed, pursued despite the obvious repercussions such actions may incur."
00:54:23.302,00:54:24.303,Ha...
00:54:25.094,00:54:27.096,simply stated...
00:54:29.308,00:54:32.477,you're going to convince Mr. Urich...
00:54:33.395,00:54:34.479,that everything is fine...
00:54:35.522,00:54:40.068,that you were wrong... that Wilson Fisk is a good man...
00:54:41.235,00:54:43.447,a man this city needs.
00:54:43.530,00:54:49.578,And then you're going to spread the gospel to everyone you've infected with your negative point of view.
00:54:54.999,00:54:57.210,But you won't...
00:54:57.293,00:55:00.171,"be the first to die, Miss Page, no."
00:55:00.254,00:55:03.550,"No, I think Mr. Urich will have that honor."
00:55:03.633,00:55:07.846,"Then we'll go to your place of employment, see to Mr. Nelson, Mr. Murdock."
00:55:07.929,00:55:11.683,"After that, your friends, family, everyone you've ever cared about."
00:55:11.766,00:55:14.853,"And when you have no tears left to shed, then..."
00:55:17.063,00:55:20.359,"then we'll come for you, Miss Page."
00:55:46.843,00:55:48.011,Hmm.
00:55:49.471,00:55:51.347,Do you really think...
00:55:51.431,00:55:54.893,I would put a loaded gun on the table where you could reach it?
00:56:02.817,00:56:05.529,Do you really think this is the first time I've shot someone?
00:56:10.867,00:02:55.342,"Miss Page-- It's a difficult thing, isn't it?"
00:02:55.425,00:02:57.176,Taking a life...
00:02:59.011,00:03:04.726,feeling of the weight and responsibility of all the years the person you've murdered has lived...
00:03:05.727,00:03:07.645,moments that they've cherished...
00:03:08.813,00:03:12.359,"the dreams that they've struggled towards, gone..."
00:03:15.528,00:03:17.071,because of you.
00:03:23.536,00:03:26.831,Something important that I've learned.
00:03:29.208,00:03:30.918,That it gets easier...
00:03:32.504,00:03:34.922,the more you do it.
00:05:40.715,00:05:42.675,the dick.
00:05:42.759,00:05:44.677,What are you doing here?
00:05:46.846,00:05:48.097,"Yeah, yours and Matt's."
00:05:49.516,00:05:52.309,"Is that why you're creeping around so late, to avoid him?"
00:05:52.394,00:05:53.728,"Okay, first, there was no creep."
00:05:53.811,00:05:59.442,You were just too whatever you were looking out the window to realize I stepped out of my office.
00:05:59.526,00:06:01.528,And have you been hitting the juice?
00:06:01.611,00:06:03.195,Because you kind of smell like a distillery.
00:06:03.279,00:06:04.280,You're one to talk.
00:06:04.363,00:06:07.450,I found you practically curled up under the bar at Josie's.
00:06:08.618,00:06:11.496,But that was the end of my night. What happened to you after that?
00:06:12.747,00:06:13.748,Nothing.
00:06:13.831,00:06:17.376,That nothing include drinking and dancing? Or just the drinking?
00:06:17.460,00:06:19.504,"Funny, you actually sound like you care."
00:06:19.587,00:06:22.715,"Karen, what's going on with me and Matt..."
00:06:22.799,00:06:24.967,it sucks that it's bleeding over to you.
00:06:25.051,00:06:26.844,It's the last thing I'd ever want to happen.
00:06:28.513,00:06:29.722,I know.
00:06:30.640,00:06:32.266,"Sorry, just, I, uh..."
00:06:35.311,00:06:37.689,Just had a... a rough night.
00:06:41.025,00:06:43.528,"Yeah, I'm thinking about giving it up, moving on to the hard stuff."
00:06:46.823,00:06:49.826,"-You don't seem like the type. -Yeah, I smoked a doobie once."
00:06:49.909,00:06:51.202,Made me drool.
00:06:51.285,00:06:54.205,"-A doobie... -Weed, pot, the Mary Jane."
00:06:54.288,00:06:56.248,Whatever the kids are calling it these days.
00:06:56.332,00:06:59.251,"I'm not sure that's, uh, considered hard anymore."
00:06:59.335,00:07:01.295,"At least, not according to Denver, anyway."
00:07:01.378,00:07:03.756,The times they are a-changin'.
00:07:06.258,00:07:07.301,Yeah.
00:07:09.178,00:07:10.304,Yeah.
00:07:12.098,00:07:14.308,"So, you coming back to the office?"
00:07:15.560,00:07:18.438,I just needed to pick up a few things.
00:07:20.523,00:07:21.733,"Wait, Foggy."
00:07:21.816,00:07:24.652,Let's not do this right now. It's not a good time.
00:07:24.736,00:07:25.903,Is it ever gonna be?
00:07:28.030,00:07:29.323,That's not really an answer.
00:07:30.533,00:07:31.826,Best one I got.
00:07:33.911,00:07:39.208,"Whatever's going on between you and Matt, it would be really nice not to be alone here, you know?"
00:07:39.291,00:07:42.837,"I know. What you said last night, you were right."
00:07:42.920,00:07:45.006,No matter what's going on between me and Matt...
00:07:45.089,00:07:47.299,that doesn't change anything with Fisk.
00:07:47.383,00:07:48.593,I'm gonna keep digging.
00:07:48.676,00:07:52.138,You can't just run around killing people and call yourself a human being.
00:07:52.221,00:07:56.017,"He's gonna pay for what he's done, just like you said."
00:07:56.100,00:07:59.228,"Do we still have a copy of all that stuff Ben gave us, from the..."
00:08:00.730,00:08:02.273,the man in the mask?
00:08:04.400,00:08:06.819,"Yeah, uh, I think so."
00:08:08.154,00:08:09.906,What are you gonna do with it?
00:08:09.989,00:08:12.659,"Honestly, I have no idea."
00:08:15.912,00:08:19.206,"So, you, uh... you don't think the Mask is a terrorist anymore?"
00:08:21.042,00:08:23.252,I don't understand what he is.
00:08:23.335,00:08:26.756,"But no, I don't think he's a terrorist."
00:08:28.299,00:08:29.801,"It's a start, I guess."
00:08:31.594,00:08:33.888,"Look, I know things are... weird."
00:08:35.472,00:08:36.724,But I'm still around.
00:08:36.808,00:08:38.726,"You need me, just call."
00:08:40.728,00:08:43.606,"-You gonna pick up this time? -Yeah, I'll pick up."
00:08:45.232,00:08:48.611,"Might not seem like it, but everything's gonna be all right."
00:08:49.571,00:08:51.030,How can you be sure?
00:08:51.948,00:08:53.199,Because I have to be.
00:08:55.076,00:08:58.621,"Ease off the booze, stay away from the Mary Jane."
00:09:00.081,00:09:01.583,Will do.
00:09:24.021,00:09:25.773,"Well, that wasn't awkward."
00:09:28.735,00:09:30.152,What are you doing here so late?
00:09:32.488,00:09:34.949,-Or early or whatever it is? -Um...
00:09:36.492,00:09:37.994,couldn't sleep.
00:09:39.579,00:09:41.330,Lot of that going around.
00:09:42.539,00:09:45.209,Seems like it's the only thing we still all have in common.
00:09:47.253,00:09:48.588,"I'm sorry, Karen."
00:09:49.589,00:09:50.715,For which part?
00:09:53.467,00:09:55.386,"All of it, pretty much."
00:09:58.347,00:09:59.431,You want coffee?
00:10:00.516,00:10:01.976,"Yeah, please."
00:10:16.240,00:10:17.825,Elena.
00:10:17.909,00:10:18.951,He didn't.
00:10:19.869,00:10:21.453,You wanna try telling him that?
00:10:23.665,00:10:24.957,"Oh, right, that..."
00:10:25.041,00:10:27.334,that would be if you two were still speaking to each other.
00:10:27.418,00:10:29.586,It's his choice.
00:10:32.464,00:10:34.300,Only if you let it be.
00:10:46.145,00:10:49.148,"You know, I'm starting to feel like I made a mistake..."
00:10:49.231,00:10:50.983,coming to work here.
00:10:52.151,00:10:54.278,-Do you want to leave? -No.
00:10:59.283,00:11:02.954,"You and Foggy, you're the only good things in my life right now."
00:11:04.080,00:11:05.539,"Karen, did something happen?"
00:11:11.628,00:11:12.671,Yes.
00:11:19.303,00:11:21.097,The world fell apart.
00:11:23.557,00:11:24.767,Didn't you notice?
00:11:57.800,00:12:00.552,Why... why am...
00:12:00.636,00:12:02.638,why am I here?
00:12:05.682,00:12:07.393,It was the benefit.
00:12:07.476,00:12:10.437,Something was in your drink.
00:12:12.314,00:12:17.153,"I should have known, the way things are, that someone would try to get to me."
00:12:18.320,00:12:21.532,And I'm sorry. You were caught in the middle.
00:12:29.206,00:12:32.668,"You almost died, Vanessa, because of me..."
00:12:33.669,00:12:36.088,because of who I am.
00:12:36.172,00:12:37.965,I made arrangements.
00:12:38.049,00:12:40.676,"When you're able to be moved, you'll be..."
00:12:42.761,00:12:44.931,taken out of the country.
00:12:46.765,00:12:48.517,Are you coming with me?
00:12:52.313,00:12:54.231,Then...
00:12:54.315,00:12:57.651,I think I'll stay where I am.
00:12:59.195,00:13:01.405,I need to keep you safe.
00:13:02.323,00:13:05.576,Is that really all you need?
00:13:05.659,00:13:07.411,I was being selfish...
00:13:09.330,00:13:11.082,believing that I could have this...
00:13:11.165,00:13:14.001,that there would be no consequences.
00:13:14.085,00:13:16.462,I knew being with you would be...
00:13:24.678,00:13:26.513,One I still make.
00:13:29.308,00:13:33.896,Find who did this to us and make them understand.
00:13:37.524,00:13:40.527,That they could never take you away from me.
00:13:45.199,00:13:48.494,Go. Go.
00:13:48.577,00:13:50.829,"-No, it can wait. -I'm still here."
00:13:52.414,00:13:54.250,I'm not leaving.
00:13:54.333,00:13:57.753,I'll make them suffer for what they've done.
00:13:57.836,00:14:01.007,I expect nothing less.
00:14:10.766,00:14:13.060,"-Sorry, sir. -What is it?"
00:14:14.103,00:14:15.437,They've located him.
00:14:16.855,00:14:18.482,And where is he?
00:14:30.077,00:14:31.703,"Oh, shit."
00:14:36.876,00:14:38.127,Look what they did to him.
00:14:38.210,00:14:40.296,What happened?
00:14:46.802,00:14:49.388,He asked for the keys to the SUV and my gun.
00:14:53.267,00:14:54.643,Alone?
00:14:57.729,00:14:59.982,He ordered me to stay.
00:15:00.066,00:15:02.776,He wanted as many men on you as possible.
00:15:12.703,00:15:14.205,-Wilson! -He's my friend!
00:15:14.288,00:15:16.332,He's... my... friend!
00:15:16.415,00:15:20.544,May... maybe this isn't the best time to be beating your men to death.
00:15:20.627,00:15:23.965,He... he did what he was told.
00:15:24.048,00:15:26.550,"I think they call that loyalty, or something."
00:15:43.442,00:15:45.694,Clean him up.
00:16:04.088,00:16:06.548,Somebody's not happy.
00:16:06.632,00:16:09.926,Nobu's accounts... are they still active?
00:16:10.011,00:16:14.056,"Yeah, but nothing's been touched since he went up in smoke."
00:16:14.140,00:16:17.476,-And Gao? -You think this is her?
00:16:17.559,00:16:20.646,"No, my money's on the Japanese."
00:16:21.730,00:16:25.401,Maybe they found out about your little bonfire with their boss.
00:16:30.114,00:16:31.240,Okay.
00:16:33.075,00:16:37.496,But... whatever war you're thinking about starting...
00:16:38.914,00:16:40.707,don't lose sight of the end game.
00:16:40.791,00:16:50.342,"Once Senator Cherryh has cleared the last of the zoning issues, you can tear down the rest of Hell's Kitchen and build your better tomorrow."
00:16:53.554,00:16:56.932,"It's a shame not everybody'll be there to see it, but..."
00:16:58.767,00:16:59.935,shit happens.
00:17:04.481,00:17:06.317,Find out who did this to...
00:17:13.199,00:17:15.201,"Just remember, uh..."
00:17:16.785,00:17:20.914,wind blows the hardest the closer you get to the mountaintop.
00:18:28.815,00:18:30.776,"You like making an entrance, don't you?"
00:18:34.738,00:18:36.698,-I need information. -Yeah?
00:18:36.782,00:18:40.076,Haven't heard anything about a man in a mask beating on bad guys lately.
00:18:40.161,00:18:41.495,Thought maybe you'd quit on us.
00:18:42.663,00:18:43.705,I'm still here.
00:18:45.916,00:18:47.418,Somebody get a piece of you?
00:18:48.252,00:18:50.171,"We went the distance, it's all that matters."
00:18:50.254,00:18:53.215,"Went the distance, huh? Sound like a boxer."
00:18:55.676,00:18:57.636,"Hey, it's what I do."
00:18:58.470,00:19:00.639,Why I'm here.
00:19:03.767,00:19:05.936,all over the city.
00:19:06.019,00:19:08.730,"Heroin, pure like you've never seen."
00:19:09.856,00:19:11.775,Call it Steel Serpent on the streets.
00:19:11.858,00:19:14.236,The man I took that off of murdered Elena Cardenas.
00:19:14.320,00:19:15.321,"Yeah, I heard about that."
00:19:16.738,00:19:20.992,"Vladimir Ranskahov, before he died, he said Fisk arranged access to the Chinese and their drugs."
00:19:24.538,00:19:26.748,You're thinking about making a move on the triads now?
00:19:26.832,00:19:28.834,"-Russians were distribution, right? -That's what I hear."
00:19:28.917,00:19:31.462,"With them out the way, there's an awful lot of money lying on the table."
00:19:31.545,00:19:33.380,You think Fisk picked up distribution?
00:19:34.381,00:19:36.258,"Like I said, a lot of money."
00:19:37.676,00:19:39.886,And I'm guessing tearing down Hell's Kitchen isn't cheap.
00:19:40.929,00:19:43.224,Interrupting the cash flow may... slow him down.
00:19:43.307,00:19:45.016,Doubt if it'll stop him.
00:19:45.100,00:19:46.227,No...
00:19:47.561,00:19:49.730,but it might knock him off balance.
00:19:49.813,00:19:53.442,"Get him mad, maybe enough to make a mistake big enough to matter."
00:19:59.406,00:20:02.993,"No, I want you to keep your head down, until this is over."
00:20:03.076,00:20:05.204,My head's fine where it's at.
00:20:05.287,00:20:06.580,"Oh, yeah?"
00:20:06.663,00:20:08.790,Vladimir's brother probably thought the same.
00:20:11.252,00:20:13.003,Point taken.
00:20:13.086,00:20:15.381,"The Chinese, who's the man at the top?"
00:20:15.464,00:20:18.634,"Isn't one, it's a woman. Never got her name."
00:20:18.717,00:20:22.346,"-Any idea where I can find her? -If I did, it'd be on the front page."
00:20:22.429,00:20:27.809,"The Russian that Blake shot in interrogation, there was a Chinese man in the back of his cab in an alley."
00:20:27.893,00:20:29.185,"Blind, carried a backpack."
00:20:29.270,00:20:32.814,I've seen those guys around town. Drugs in the pack?
00:20:33.774,00:20:35.108,Little busy to check.
00:20:36.026,00:20:39.863,Would make sense. Nobody'd look at a blind man twice.
00:20:41.072,00:20:42.741,"No, they wouldn't."
00:20:44.159,00:20:46.161,You said you've seen them around.
00:20:48.330,00:20:49.498,51st and 9th.
00:20:49.581,00:20:50.999,No...
00:20:51.082,00:20:52.918,10th. 51st and 10th.
00:20:53.001,00:20:54.711,But that was a while back.
00:20:54.795,00:20:56.672,I'll see what I can find.
00:20:56.755,00:20:59.049,"It was during the day, morning rush hour."
00:20:59.132,00:21:02.719,-Guy like you might stick out. -I'll dress down.
00:21:07.140,00:21:11.019,"How about you get yourself a better outfit, you gonna keep running around out there?"
00:21:11.102,00:21:12.187,I'm working on it.
00:21:14.230,00:21:15.941,"Watch your back, Ben."
00:21:16.024,00:21:19.486,Fisk is an animal... and we're backing him into a corner.
00:21:29.871,00:21:32.416,"Hey, sorry. Couldn't flag a cab."
00:21:33.208,00:21:35.711,You know that buffalo wouldn't make me a vodka martini?
00:21:43.885,00:21:45.596,You want a martini? I'll get you a martini.
00:21:45.679,00:21:48.724,What I want is to not be in this petri dish a second longer than I have to.
00:21:48.807,00:21:50.100,Why are we meeting here?
00:21:53.979,00:21:55.647,My help?
00:21:55.731,00:21:56.857,Yeah.
00:21:57.524,00:22:00.151,"That's disappointing, I thought this was a booty call."
00:22:01.528,00:22:04.865,"You remember the tenement case, that I came to Landman and Zack about?"
00:22:04.948,00:22:06.241,"Yeah, Mrs. Cardenas."
00:22:06.325,00:22:08.744,Thought you were gonna say Carnitas again.
00:22:08.827,00:22:11.747,I'm not a complete asshole. I heard about what happened to her.
00:22:11.830,00:22:13.374,"Yeah, but that's only half the story."
00:22:13.457,00:22:15.584,Her tenement was just one building that was targeted.
00:22:15.667,00:22:18.003,"There's dozens of others across Hell's Kitchen, maybe hundreds."
00:22:18.086,00:22:19.796,Targeted by who?
00:22:24.551,00:22:26.970,"-Okay, I gotta go. -Wait, just wait a second."
00:22:27.053,00:22:29.222,We represent Fisk. I can't talk to you about this.
00:22:34.227,00:22:35.646,read.
00:22:35.729,00:22:37.981,"Five minutes, please."
00:22:40.316,00:22:42.444,And only because you were actually really good the other night.
00:22:53.455,00:22:55.123,Everybody's gotta be sneaking around tonight?
00:22:56.583,00:22:58.960,Why haven't you published the story about what Fisk did to his father?
00:22:59.044,00:23:01.838,"-I told you, I'd think about it. -It needs to be out there, Ben."
00:23:01.922,00:23:03.256,Can we talk about this tomorrow?
00:23:03.339,00:23:05.008,I think they know...
00:23:06.427,00:23:08.429,that we found his mother.
00:23:10.221,00:23:13.308,"I think they know, Ben."
00:23:15.393,00:23:17.521,Been trying to find a second source.
00:23:17.604,00:23:21.066,There's a guy... who knew Rigoletto back in the day...
00:23:22.484,00:23:24.110,relocated to Florida.
00:23:24.194,00:23:26.154,Just waiting to hear back.
00:23:26.237,00:23:30.158,What does that have to do with... It isn't about who he owed money to.
00:23:30.241,00:23:31.367,It's a connection.
00:23:31.452,00:23:34.496,Bill Fisk owed money to Rigoletto.
00:23:34.580,00:23:39.334,"My source remembers anything about that, it's a piece of her story we can prove."
00:23:39.417,00:23:43.964,From there-- There isn't going to be a from there if we don't do something... right now.
00:23:44.047,00:23:46.091,"I work for a newspaper, Karen."
00:23:46.174,00:23:49.886,Not some Internet blog where the facts are whatever you make up.
00:23:49.970,00:23:51.262,Yeah.
00:23:58.144,00:24:02.440,You said you think they might know that we went out to Saint Benezet.
00:24:02.524,00:24:03.692,How?
00:24:06.027,00:24:07.779,It's just a feeling.
00:24:10.031,00:24:13.284,"Yeah, had plenty of those over the years."
00:24:13.368,00:24:15.370,"Sometimes they were right, sometimes not."
00:24:15.453,00:24:18.832,"No, you have to trust me on this, Ben."
00:24:27.423,00:24:30.636,And who'll believe me when they start digging?
00:24:34.222,00:24:35.766,what you found...
00:24:37.308,00:24:39.102,when you were looking into me.
00:24:47.653,00:24:50.321,I'll see if I can shake loose any other sources.
00:24:51.573,00:24:54.034,"Write up what I've got tomorrow, give it to my editor."
00:24:54.117,00:24:55.451,See what happens.
00:24:56.537,00:24:59.122,Thank you. Thank you.
00:25:05.045,00:25:06.462,Where did you get all this?
00:25:07.380,00:25:10.175,Some of it Matt and I turned up working the tenement case.
00:25:10.258,00:25:11.593,And the rest of it?
00:25:14.262,00:25:15.639,The Devil of Hell's Kitchen.
00:25:17.223,00:25:19.434,You're working with that prick that blew up half the city?
00:25:19.517,00:25:21.102,You read what's in there. He didn't do it.
00:25:22.729,00:25:25.774,My client has been all over the news trying to help this city.
00:25:25.857,00:25:29.277,"So, there's nothing that's been going on at Landman and Zack?"
00:25:29.360,00:25:32.197,Nothing that doesn't feel right with Fisk?
00:25:34.741,00:25:39.120,"Fisk is one of our most billable clients, along with Owlsley at Silver and Brent."
00:25:39.204,00:25:41.665,"You know, I could lose my job just sitting here."
00:25:41.748,00:25:43.416,Maybe even get disbarred.
00:25:43.499,00:25:45.794,You didn't answer the question.
00:25:47.588,00:25:51.299,Remember what I said when I came in into Landman and Zack to discuss the case?
00:25:53.259,00:25:54.928,About how you used to have a soul?
00:25:58.389,00:25:59.933,I remember how much you cared.
00:26:00.016,00:26:03.144,"About the law, about what was right."
00:26:03.228,00:26:05.814,"Before the clothes and the expense account, and scrambling to make partner."
00:26:05.897,00:26:08.274,You're asking me to commit career suicide.
00:26:08.358,00:26:11.111,I'm asking you to trust me.
00:26:11.194,00:26:17.993,"One way or another, Fisk, Owlsley, anyone connected with what they've been doing, they're gonna get what's coming to them."
00:26:18.076,00:26:22.748,And there are gonna be some hard questions about how much Landman and Zack knew and when they knew it.
00:26:22.831,00:26:25.876,This is your chance to get out in front of that...
00:26:25.959,00:26:27.628,and take your soul back.
00:30:23.654,00:30:24.865,Ellison in his office?
00:30:24.948,00:30:27.826,"His kid's got something at school, he'll be in later."
00:30:46.427,00:30:50.765,There are people... They-- I liked it there.
00:30:52.642,00:30:57.563,They brought me a piece of Zuppa every night before I went to bed.
00:31:00.275,00:31:03.403,I don't know any Italian.
00:31:03.486,00:31:07.032,"-What am I gonna watch on the TV? -Oh, we'll sort it out."
00:31:09.075,00:31:13.329,They brought a piece of Zuppa... every night.
00:31:20.336,00:31:21.922,Mom.
00:31:27.177,00:31:29.971,"It's such a beautiful day, isn't it?"
00:31:30.680,00:31:31.847,It is.
00:31:33.308,00:31:37.312,Have you thought any more about my... my friend Wesley?
00:31:37.395,00:31:39.230,James Wesley?
00:31:39.314,00:31:42.358,We spoke about him on the phone.
00:31:45.528,00:31:48.114,-Such a handsome boy. -Mmm.
00:31:48.198,00:31:50.741,"Always so well dressed, polite."
00:31:50.825,00:31:53.078,He called you the other night.
00:31:56.915,00:32:00.335,When I was busy. It was the last phone call that he...
00:32:02.212,00:32:04.297,Do you remember what you talked about?
00:32:09.469,00:32:10.678,Mother?
00:32:13.764,00:32:16.351,"Such a beautiful day, isn't it?"
00:32:28.446,00:32:31.157,"His kid plays the cello, got a solo."
00:32:31.241,00:32:32.700,Looks like there's a reception after.
00:32:32.783,00:32:36.496,"-Did you try his phone? -Yeah, he's not picking up. Look..."
00:32:36.579,00:32:40.041,sit tight until he gets back and I can run this past him.
00:32:40.125,00:32:41.459,"And keep your eyes open, okay?"
00:32:41.542,00:32:43.711,"Yeah. You, too."
00:32:48.383,00:32:50.218,"Yeah, I gotta take this. It's Matt."
00:32:50.301,00:32:51.719,I'll call you when I know something.
00:32:55.056,00:32:56.516,"Hey, you coming in?"
00:33:02.105,00:33:04.357,I'm working on something.
00:33:04.440,00:33:06.109,I think it might help.
00:33:06.192,00:33:09.654,"But until I know for sure, I need you to stay out of it."
00:33:09.737,00:33:11.990,"If you talk to Foggy, you tell him the same?"
00:33:13.824,00:33:16.995,"Uh, yeah, I'll pass it along..."
00:33:17.078,00:33:19.289,"if I, uh, talk to him."
00:33:19.372,00:33:20.706,"Uh, Karen?"
00:33:22.917,00:33:25.961,Everything's gonna work out... I promise.
00:33:27.672,00:33:29.465,Yeah...
00:33:29.549,00:33:31.176,See you tomorrow.
00:33:36.764,00:33:38.433,You're in the middle of having it with me.
00:33:38.516,00:33:41.727,"Heard my son play Brahms today, in front of the entire school."
00:33:41.811,00:33:43.979,One of the greatest moments of my life.
00:33:46.857,00:33:48.484,This could expose Fisk.
00:33:48.568,00:33:51.612,All this story is gonna do is expose this paper to a lawsuit.
00:33:51.696,00:33:53.989,"I mean, there is no follow-up, no corroboration."
00:33:54.074,00:33:56.367,You read what his mother said about what he did when he was a kid?
00:33:56.451,00:33:57.618,She's a sick old lady.
00:33:57.702,00:33:59.620,"I mean, she probably thinks Nixon's still in office."
00:33:59.704,00:34:01.747,"Run the article. It'll sell papers, it's sexy."
00:34:01.831,00:34:03.249,You sound like a whore.
00:34:03.333,00:34:05.543,"Well, I learned how to be one from you."
00:34:06.377,00:34:08.379,"I get lucky sometimes, sure."
00:34:08.463,00:34:10.881,"Land a story that makes a difference, like Union Allied."
00:34:10.965,00:34:14.885,"But most of the time, now, working for this paper..."
00:34:14.969,00:34:18.348,I might as well be wearing lipstick and a red dress.
00:34:20.350,00:34:23.478,Take the rest of the week. You're suspended.
00:34:25.855,00:34:32.737,Fisk is leaving a trail of bodies and if we don't stop it-- Wilson Fisk is spending millions of dollars trying to save this city.
00:34:32.820,00:34:37.450,"Maybe you should drop the Woodward and Bernstein, try writing a story about that."
00:34:37.533,00:34:38.826,How much is he paying you?
00:34:41.121,00:34:47.960,"Ever since Union Allied, I can't get a story that's about what's really happening in this city to print."
00:34:48.878,00:34:51.839,"So, how much is Fisk paying you to keep it that way?"
00:34:51.922,00:34:59.139,"The reason that you can't get any of your crime pieces into the paper lately is because they're shit, Ben."
00:34:59.222,00:35:00.556,Just like that one.
00:35:00.640,00:35:04.185,"And I think, deep down, you know that, too."
00:35:04.269,00:35:06.854,"You know what, forget about the suspension."
00:35:06.937,00:35:09.023,Clear out your office.
00:35:09.107,00:35:11.234,I'm done trying to help you.
00:38:35.229,00:38:37.272,"No, wait, wait, wait!"
00:38:37.357,00:38:39.692,"I'm trying to help you! Wait, no, please!"
00:38:44.822,00:38:45.906,Not that I would.
00:38:45.990,00:38:49.660,Bastards are like shadows in a dark room.
00:38:49.744,00:38:52.788,Maybe all this really was that nut in the mask.
00:38:54.374,00:38:57.918,Poison and guns aren't the way he operates.
00:38:58.002,00:39:01.506,"Piss a guy off enough, he'll start doing whatever it takes."
00:39:01.589,00:39:02.840,Francis.
00:39:04.467,00:39:05.593,Sir?
00:39:05.676,00:39:07.595,Double the offer on the streets.
00:39:07.678,00:39:10.598,"-Keep doubling it until someone talks. -Yes, sir."
00:39:12.141,00:39:14.769,You trust him after that beating you laid on?
00:39:15.686,00:39:17.021,Wesley trusted him.
00:39:19.314,00:39:20.650,That his?
00:39:20.733,00:39:21.817,Yes?
00:39:23.528,00:39:26.531,"No, he's not able to come to the phone. What do you have?"
00:39:31.160,00:39:32.495,Thank you.
00:39:34.079,00:39:35.665,I have to go.
00:39:35.748,00:39:39.001,Go where? We're in the middle of...
00:40:16.163,00:40:17.498,All those people...
00:40:17.582,00:40:19.875,-You took their eyes. -No.
00:40:19.959,00:40:22.377,They blinded themselves.
00:40:22.462,00:40:24.004,Why would they do that?
00:40:24.088,00:40:26.549,Because they have faith.
00:40:26.632,00:40:29.051,In you and your drugs?
00:40:29.134,00:40:32.805,In something beyond the distractions of your world.
00:40:34.056,00:40:36.183,You have taken that from them.
00:40:37.267,00:40:40.104,"Now, they will have nothing."
00:40:40.938,00:40:42.565,You're gonna tell me about Fisk.
00:41:15.931,00:41:17.266,Get these people out of here.
00:41:54.554,00:41:56.096,You're going to be okay. Come on.
00:42:02.269,00:42:03.813,Don't you move!
00:42:06.273,00:42:08.568,"Hands, let me see your hands!"
00:42:08.651,00:42:10.069,Hands!
00:42:14.865,00:42:16.408,"Slowly, slowly."
00:42:17.577,00:42:19.369,You're the guy.
00:42:26.376,00:42:30.047,"I did not kill Detective Blake, or shoot those cops."
00:42:36.261,00:42:37.888,Working for Wilson Fisk.
00:42:37.972,00:42:40.933,Along with a lot of others in your precinct.
00:42:41.016,00:42:43.227,I'm not the bad guy.
00:42:43.310,00:42:44.519,Then what are you?
00:42:51.276,00:42:53.362,Officer down. Call it in now.
00:43:07.960,00:43:11.672,"Apologies, I was detained by unfortunate events."
00:43:13.841,00:43:15.259,You speak English now?
00:43:15.760,00:43:18.053,The need for illusion has passed.
00:43:19.680,00:43:22.224,That have anything to do with why you're late?
00:43:22.307,00:43:24.309,The man in the mask.
00:43:24.393,00:43:27.688,-The heroin? -Lost in the flames.
00:43:28.606,00:43:29.940,"So, bring more in."
00:43:30.024,00:43:33.360,"My interest here has never been about heroin, Leland."
00:43:33.443,00:43:37.907,"That was borne of convenience, and it is no longer so."
00:43:39.449,00:43:43.621,Do what you want. I could honestly care less.
00:43:43.704,00:43:47.541,If he finds out what we did... this isn't gonna matter.
00:43:51.420,00:43:58.343,"We knew the risk, and the reward, if his woman were to be removed as a distraction."
00:43:58.427,00:44:00.429,I should've just had her shot.
00:44:00.512,00:44:04.892,"Well, he still believes that the poison was meant for him, -yes? -Far as I know."
00:44:04.975,00:44:07.311,Then our path was the correct one.
00:44:07.394,00:44:10.022,"Except for the part where she's not dead, sure."
00:44:10.105,00:44:12.858,The woman is stronger than assumed.
00:44:12.942,00:44:14.902,"Yeah, she's a real mule."
00:44:16.737,00:44:17.863,What about Wesley?
00:44:17.947,00:44:20.282,-What about him? -He's dead.
00:44:20.365,00:44:23.410,"Found in a basement, couple holes in his chest."
00:44:23.493,00:44:24.704,Thought maybe that was you.
00:44:24.787,00:44:28.791,No... he had never shown me discourtesy.
00:44:30.918,00:44:32.670,"So, what's our play here?"
00:44:32.753,00:44:35.422,The wheel constantly turns.
00:44:35.505,00:44:39.927,"We must adapt to its position, or be crushed beneath it."
00:44:40.010,00:44:42.930,What? Where the hell are you going?
00:44:43.013,00:44:46.892,I will visit my homeland and reflect upon the future.
00:44:46.976,00:44:48.477,Home? China?
00:44:50.604,00:44:53.232,It is a considerable distance farther.
00:44:54.900,00:44:56.568,We shall not speak again.
00:44:58.195,00:44:59.488,"Fine, go!"
00:45:00.405,00:45:02.699,You think I don't have a fallback?
00:45:02.783,00:45:06.912,"You think I got this far without looking at my own damn tea leaves, huh?"
00:45:24.764,00:45:26.891,Till I get a better girl.
00:45:34.815,00:45:35.816,Mmm.
00:45:37.777,00:45:38.819,Hard day?
00:45:40.654,00:45:41.781,I've had better.
00:45:41.864,00:45:44.699,"You've had worse, too. Am I right?"
00:45:45.617,00:45:47.286,Usually are.
00:45:47.369,00:45:49.246,I have my moments.
00:45:49.329,00:45:51.748,"Not many lately, but..."
00:45:53.500,00:45:55.169,Let's go to Paris...
00:46:01.050,00:46:02.676,While we're still young.
00:46:02.759,00:46:06.013,"Ooh, you want to run away together?"
00:46:06.096,00:46:08.891,Or just... run away?
00:46:11.977,00:46:14.604,How long we been together?
00:46:14.688,00:46:17.524,Don't remember a time when we weren't.
00:46:17.607,00:46:21.070,Got to know that look in your eye early on.
00:46:21.153,00:46:26.366,"Ben, there's a story eating at you... one you know you gotta tell."
00:46:27.284,00:46:29.286,Not that simple.
00:46:29.369,00:46:32.789,Telling the truth is never simple... or easy.
00:46:32.873,00:46:35.835,"Why, only the best of us ever really try."
00:46:36.668,00:46:37.752,Yeah.
00:46:38.670,00:46:40.505,Ellison thinks it's a pile of shit.
00:46:40.589,00:46:43.258,You straighten him out.
00:46:43.342,00:46:45.344,We got into it.
00:46:47.637,00:46:49.223,He let me go.
00:46:52.101,00:46:55.270,Good... You never needed that man.
00:46:55.354,00:46:57.314,You never needed that paper.
00:46:57.397,00:46:59.900,You only ever needed a story.
00:46:59.984,00:47:01.360,Go tell it.
00:47:01.443,00:47:03.863,How? Shout it from the rooftops?
00:47:03.946,00:47:08.158,"You know there's this thing called the Internet, right?"
00:47:08.242,00:47:11.203,"Reach a whole lot of folks, huh?"
00:47:11.286,00:47:13.788,More than you ever could at the Bulletin.
00:47:16.750,00:47:18.585,"So, cut through it."
00:47:18.668,00:47:21.630,The world needs Ben Urich to tell the truth...
00:47:21.713,00:47:23.966,any way he can.
00:47:28.095,00:47:30.890,-You quit? -Not exactly the way it went.
00:47:35.019,00:47:36.520,Don't be.
00:47:36.603,00:47:38.772,Bulletin's not the paper I fell in love with.
00:47:38.855,00:47:40.065,Hasn't been for a long time.
00:47:40.149,00:47:42.817,Just too damn stubborn to let it go.
00:47:42.902,00:47:45.737,You really think Ellison was taking money from Fisk?
00:47:45.820,00:47:48.991,Don't know. Explains a lot.
00:47:51.660,00:47:53.828,Thinking I might start a blog.
00:47:53.913,00:47:55.289,Hear that's all you kids read these days.
00:47:55.372,00:47:57.749,I thought you hated that kind of shit.
00:47:57.832,00:48:02.337,"Yeah, but you can reach an awful lot of people that way if you got the right story to tell."
00:48:02.421,00:48:04.048,You're gonna write about Fisk killing his father?
00:48:05.632,00:48:07.676,I'm going to write about all of it...
00:48:07.759,00:48:08.928,tonight.
00:48:09.761,00:48:11.013,Get it out there.
00:48:11.096,00:48:13.432,Fisk wants to sue me...
00:48:14.975,00:48:16.851,at least I know a couple decent lawyers.
00:48:18.478,00:48:21.565,"This is gonna change everything, Ben. It has to."
00:48:21.648,00:48:23.608,One foot in front of the other.
00:48:23.692,00:48:26.486,I'll send you the link when it's up.
00:48:26.570,00:48:28.822,"We'll go from there, okay?"
00:48:28.905,00:48:30.074,Call you in the morning.
00:49:08.195,00:49:09.696,I'm sorry.
00:49:11.906,00:49:14.201,"We, uh, locking this now?"
00:49:17.537,00:49:18.913,Seems like a good idea.
00:49:25.212,00:49:26.546,Yeah...
00:49:31.468,00:49:34.013,"It's, uh, late. You should go home."
00:49:38.850,00:49:39.976,Matt?
00:49:45.815,00:49:47.942,Is this what we are now?
00:49:49.736,00:49:52.864,Three people who don't even talk to each other?
00:49:57.036,00:49:58.620,I know this guy...
00:50:00.622,00:50:02.416,We were close once.
00:50:09.464,00:50:13.052,I'd have to push the people that I care about away...
00:50:16.305,00:50:18.598,if I wanted to be effective at what I do.
00:50:21.601,00:50:23.562,Seems like you listened.
00:50:24.979,00:50:26.022,Yeah.
00:50:29.943,00:50:32.571,"This guy, he has a way of, uh..."
00:50:33.655,00:50:35.949,"getting in your head, you know?"
00:50:40.412,00:50:41.913,And here's the thing...
00:50:43.332,00:50:45.125,I had a really shitty night.
00:50:47.169,00:50:55.219,"The kind where you think you've seen the bottom of humanity, and the pit just keeps getting deeper, you know?"
00:50:58.638,00:51:00.932,I... I can't...
00:51:07.897,00:51:09.233,I can't...
00:51:11.276,00:51:14.238,I can't take another step.
00:52:55.255,00:52:56.340,I've made mistakes...
00:52:58.174,00:53:01.010,in the years since I was a boy.
00:53:02.095,00:53:05.307,"I try to learn from them, but it isn't always enough."
00:53:06.516,00:53:08.184,Get out of my house.
00:53:09.228,00:53:10.604,I'll leave.
00:53:11.563,00:53:15.609,"But first, I'd... I'd like to have a conversation with you."
00:53:15.692,00:53:17.236,"Off the record, of course."
00:53:17.902,00:53:20.071,You think I believe anything you have to say?
00:53:27.371,00:53:30.206,"Whether you choose to believe, that's up to you."
00:53:33.543,00:53:34.878,All right.
00:53:36.880,00:53:38.089,Let's hear it.
00:53:38.172,00:53:39.924,I want to apologize.
00:53:43.470,00:53:47.766,I thought that your days of being relevant were past.
00:53:48.975,00:53:50.769,"And for thinking that, I..."
00:53:51.811,00:53:53.813,I'm truly sorry.
00:53:54.898,00:53:56.525,Apology accepted.
00:53:58.860,00:54:00.529,You know where the door is.
00:54:00.612,00:54:02.113,Oh...
00:54:05.033,00:54:08.537,I know you lost your position at the Bulletin.
00:54:10.079,00:54:11.790,News travels fast.
00:54:11.873,00:54:17.379,"After your article on... Union Allied, I took precautions."
00:54:18.880,00:54:21.675,I didn't want to be surprised by any more exposés.
00:54:22.717,00:54:25.595,Figured you had somebody at the paper on your payroll.
00:54:26.220,00:54:29.724,"As I said, I try to learn from my mistakes."
00:54:32.936,00:54:34.396,You're not the only one.
00:54:36.981,00:54:41.361,And do you think that rambling on the Internet will change anything?
00:54:43.029,00:54:46.783,People seek the truth... no matter where they find it.
00:54:48.076,00:54:51.621,That may have been the case when you and I were young.
00:54:54.333,00:54:59.921,This world around us is preoccupied with celebrity weddings and...
00:55:00.922,00:55:02.507,videos of cats.
00:55:03.174,00:55:07.261,"But... complicated issues, issues that matter..."
00:55:10.474,00:55:12.392,they take too much focus.
00:55:14.185,00:55:19.858,They take too much time away from texting and the thousand channels on the satellite dish.
00:55:20.692,00:55:23.277,Guess I have more faith in humanity.
00:55:23.362,00:55:24.821,Ah.
00:55:26.197,00:55:28.324,"So did Christ, if I recall."
00:55:30.994,00:55:32.371,I'll go.
00:55:33.329,00:55:35.164,Just one more thing.
00:55:39.669,00:55:42.381,Were you alone when you spoke to my mother?
00:55:49.513,00:55:51.139,Your guy at the Bulletin.
00:55:51.222,00:55:54.267,"Yes, I received a call that was upsetting."
00:55:56.352,00:55:58.312,Were you alone?
00:56:00.356,00:56:03.777,Yeah... I was alone.
00:56:06.112,00:56:08.364,"Wesley, was that you?"
00:56:09.408,00:56:12.827,"-Wesley? -Yes, I didn't think so."
00:56:12.911,00:56:14.746,"You're a man of principle, of conviction."
00:56:14.829,00:56:17.624,"I understand that, I even admire it."
00:56:22.378,00:56:24.756,But you went after my mother.
00:56:27.717,00:56:30.804,That's not something that I can forgive.
00:56:35.266,00:56:38.437,I wrote a lot of stories in my years pushing ink.
00:56:40.063,00:56:43.483,You know how many times people have threatened me...
00:56:43.567,00:56:45.485,get me to keep my mouth shut?
00:56:46.945,00:56:52.492,"But this is my mother... that you brought into this, Mr. Urich."
00:56:52.576,00:56:53.785,My mother!
00:56:58.540,00:57:01.084,So I am not here to threaten you.
00:57:01.167,00:57:03.002,I'm here to kill you.
00:02:07.835,00:02:08.878,Over here!
00:02:11.005,00:02:12.006,Come on!
00:02:23.100,00:02:24.811,Help me.
00:02:24.894,00:02:26.604,Get him out.
00:02:35.863,00:02:36.948,"Easy, easy, easy."
00:02:39.201,00:02:40.993,Okay. Go upstairs...
00:02:41.077,00:02:42.704,and close the door.
00:02:42.787,00:02:43.788,And not a word to anybody.
00:02:44.956,00:02:46.499,Not even your mom.
00:03:53.316,00:03:54.567,"No, no calls."
00:03:54.651,00:03:57.570,-It's okay. I'm just trying to help. -No.
00:03:57.654,00:03:59.447,-We have to get you to the hospital. -They'll kill everyone.
00:04:01.157,00:04:03.826,-Who? -The men who did this.
00:04:03.910,00:04:06.371,They'll kill everyone in the hospital to get to me.
00:04:08.331,00:04:11.167,Don't. You've lost a lot of blood. I think you might have been stabbed.
00:04:11.251,00:04:12.835,I have to leave.
00:04:16.839,00:04:18.049,You wanna leave? Door's that way.
00:04:28.435,00:04:33.690,Murdock has dominated this fight but now Price has turned the table on him.
00:04:33.773,00:04:46.828,He's pounding Murdock's head 2-to-1 favorite Battlin' Jack Murdock loses to a TKO in the 10th.
00:05:42.842,00:05:46.012,"Hey, hey, don't... don't get blood on your shirt."
00:05:49.265,00:05:52.351,"Yeah, well, I... I should have you in my corner."
00:05:56.439,00:05:58.190,It don't tickle.
00:05:58.274,00:05:59.859,Go get the kit.
00:06:07.659,00:06:10.870,"Hey, anybody who's got the guts to step into that ring deserves respect."
00:06:10.953,00:06:11.954,Don't you ever forget that.
00:06:12.038,00:06:14.457,-Even Price? -Even Price.
00:06:15.458,00:06:18.002,"-Sorry you lost, Dad. -Yeah..."
00:06:18.085,00:06:19.295,Just wasn't my night.
00:06:20.212,00:06:23.132,"Easy, easy, easy. Easy with the cotton swabs there, doc."
00:06:24.967,00:06:27.386,You don't want to get it infected.
00:06:27.470,00:06:30.139,"-Stitches? -Oh, yeah."
00:06:31.223,00:06:33.059,You better get the Scotch.
00:06:40.107,00:06:41.150,No.
00:06:44.529,00:06:46.906,You think I want your hands shaking like last time?
00:06:47.824,00:06:50.076,This is my face we're talking about.
00:06:51.744,00:06:52.787,Go ahead.
00:06:52.870,00:06:54.539,Take a-- Just a little sip.
00:07:00.545,00:07:02.714,"Oh, it burns!"
00:07:07.051,00:07:08.886,Let's do it.
00:07:13.641,00:07:15.017,Don't move.
00:07:21.649,00:07:23.192,So you watched the fight?
00:07:25.862,00:07:28.573,You're supposed to be doing your homework.
00:07:28.656,00:07:30.617,Got it done first.
00:07:30.700,00:07:32.034,All of it?
00:07:33.953,00:07:37.123,I want you to finish up before you go to bed.
00:07:37.206,00:07:38.958,-I'll do it tomorrow. -Tonight.
00:07:39.041,00:07:42.003,-Before school? -Tonight.
00:07:42.086,00:07:43.880,Okay?
00:07:45.840,00:07:48.092,"All right. Go ahead, go ahead."
00:07:50.845,00:07:51.846,Dad?
00:08:10.364,00:08:11.574,You got all this for losing?
00:08:13.701,00:08:15.411,Sometimes...
00:08:15.495,00:08:18.455,"even when you get knocked down, you can still win."
00:08:18.540,00:08:19.916,It ain't how you hit the mat...
00:08:26.839,00:08:28.508,Go hit the books.
00:08:28.591,00:08:29.717,Can I take the bottle?
00:08:29.801,00:08:31.761,No. Just... Go on. Go on.
00:09:17.014,00:09:18.725,"You know I'm still here, right?"
00:09:25.648,00:09:28.275,Could you... could you hear me just now?
00:09:30.820,00:09:31.821,Nope.
00:09:31.904,00:09:35.908,"The correct answer is, Yes, and you sound amazing."
00:09:43.415,00:09:45.001,I could ask you the same.
00:09:45.084,00:09:56.804,"Yes, but I am a partner at a prestigious law firm with very important documents needing to be documented so we can start generating some revenue, while you are..."
00:09:59.098,00:10:07.356,"also very integral in your own special, manager-- I dug myself in too deep and I can't climb out."
00:10:07.439,00:10:08.900,-You need a hand with that? -Please.
00:10:14.238,00:10:15.740,I have work to do.
00:10:17.825,00:10:20.119,"Well, your shit's not gonna unpack itself."
00:10:24.581,00:10:28.460,"You should be out having a life, doing poppers and flapper dancing."
00:10:28.544,00:10:31.588,"-I don't know what kids do these days. -We're the same age, Foggy."
00:10:31.673,00:10:33.174,"So you're saying I shouldn't be here, either?"
00:10:38.846,00:10:40.723,Those things don't seem to apply to you.
00:10:46.395,00:10:49.023,I just don't feel like going home...
00:10:49.106,00:10:50.107,okay?
00:10:53.069,00:10:54.153,"Well, we can't stay here."
00:10:54.236,00:10:57.782,Not enough money in the kitty to keep the lights on past midnight.
00:10:57.865,00:10:59.742,"So let's hop a few bars, not think about it."
00:11:02.369,00:11:04.997,Yes. Big fan of the not thinking.
00:11:07.374,00:11:11.545,"-Should we call Matt? -Sure. Yeah, let's see what he's up to."
00:11:19.095,00:11:20.096,Are you gonna listen to me this time?
00:11:20.179,00:11:23.515,-Where am I? -You're in my apartment.
00:11:23.599,00:11:24.600,Who are you?
00:11:25.101,00:11:27.770,I'm the lucky girl who pulled you out of the garbage.
00:11:29.731,00:11:31.816,-You've seen my face. -Yeah.
00:11:34.318,00:11:35.611,Great.
00:11:35.694,00:11:37.279,"Your outfit kind of sucks, by the way."
00:11:40.616,00:11:42.534,"Okay, I really wouldn't try to move too much."
00:11:42.618,00:11:50.918,"You've got two or three broken ribs, probable concussion, some kind of puncture wound, and that's just the stuff that I know about."
00:11:51.002,00:11:58.425,"And your eyes, they're nonresponsive to light, which isn't freaking you the hell out, so either you're blind or in way worse shape than I thought."
00:11:58.509,00:11:59.969,Do I have to pick one?
00:12:01.595,00:12:05.682,Do you mind telling me how a blind man in a mask ends up beaten half to death in my dumpster?
00:12:05.767,00:12:07.143,"The less you know about me, the better."
00:12:21.698,00:12:25.494,"but I can't tell how bad it is internally without a full series of X-rays, so..."
00:12:25.577,00:12:27.789,No. No hospitals.
00:12:28.747,00:12:30.582,This is my night off.
00:12:30.666,00:12:32.626,I'm really not looking for some guy to die on my couch.
00:12:32.709,00:12:33.710,Are you a doctor?
00:12:35.379,00:12:36.630,Something like that.
00:12:37.756,00:12:40.927,"Most people, they find a bleeding masked man in the garbage..."
00:12:42.594,00:12:45.014,-You got a lot of experience in this area? -Why are you helping me?
00:12:55.858,00:12:57.318,You got a name at least?
00:13:14.293,00:13:16.503,"All right, I'll call you Mike."
00:13:17.171,00:13:19.841,"-Mike? -Yeah, a guy I used to date."
00:13:19.924,00:13:22.885,"Turns out he was very good at keeping secrets, too."
00:13:31.352,00:13:33.270,"Thank you, Claire."
00:13:36.648,00:13:41.820,Rest. Make sure you're stabilized. We'll figure the other stuff out later.
00:13:55.251,00:13:56.585,I can't see!
00:13:58.629,00:13:59.922,It's Dad. I'm right here.
00:14:03.050,00:14:04.593,"You were in an accident, you remember?"
00:14:04.676,00:14:16.188,"You're in the hospital, It's Daddy. Here, feel my face. Feel my face."
00:14:17.064,00:14:18.690,I'm right here.
00:14:20.442,00:14:21.443,I'm right here.
00:14:23.612,00:14:25.156,"-Dad, I can't see! -It's all right, Matt."
00:14:25.239,00:14:26.657,-I can't-- -It's all right.
00:14:31.412,00:14:32.829,What is it? What's wrong?
00:14:38.627,00:14:40.629,Can't...
00:14:40.712,00:14:43.799,You've got air in your chest. It's collapsing your lung.
00:14:43.883,00:14:47.428,"I'm gonna relieve the pressure, but I'm gonna need you to hold still, okay?"
00:15:04.361,00:15:05.362,Here we go.
00:15:26.342,00:15:27.884,Good.
00:15:34.683,00:15:36.018,All right.
00:15:37.686,00:15:38.895,Look...
00:15:40.772,00:15:48.697,"let's just say for the sake of discussion I buy this whole, We can't go to the hospital because whatever story you've got going on."
00:15:48.780,00:15:51.908,But we need to talk about what happens if you give up the ghost here in my living room.
00:15:52.826,00:16:00.334,"Because I'm listening to myself explain to the police how I let this happen, and every version ends with me in handcuffs, so convince me it's worth it."
00:16:01.418,00:16:03.212,They kidnapped a boy.
00:16:03.295,00:16:04.588,Who did?
00:16:08.467,00:16:11.220,They've been running a human trafficking ring out of Hell's Kitchen.
00:16:12.721,00:16:15.057,Took over when the Italians folded up.
00:16:16.267,00:16:19.520,"Two days ago, they pulled a kid out of the back of a van."
00:16:19.603,00:16:20.854,Beat his father while he watched.
00:16:23.690,00:16:25.317,I knew the kid would still be alive.
00:16:25.401,00:16:27.819,At least until they took him out of the city.
00:16:28.988,00:16:33.075,I tracked the Russians to a warehouse not far from here.
00:16:33.993,00:16:36.745,"Thought I was being smart, how fast I found them."
00:16:37.746,00:16:39.748,"Turns out, I wasn't."
00:16:42.918,00:16:44.628,They were waiting for you.
00:16:45.254,00:16:47.006,And I walked right into it.
00:16:52.636,00:16:54.763,"Yeah, I've been making their lives..."
00:16:58.142,00:16:59.143,But you're blind.
00:17:01.395,00:17:03.314,There are other ways to see.
00:17:03.397,00:17:04.565,This is what you do?
00:17:08.360,00:17:09.486,It's one way of putting it.
00:17:10.821,00:17:13.032,"No offense, but you don't seem to be very good at it."
00:17:14.200,00:17:15.451,Ow!
00:17:15.534,00:17:17.494,"Yeah, well, you're catching me on an off night."
00:17:19.746,00:17:21.290,Did you at least find the kid?
00:17:25.836,00:17:27.588,"No, he wasn't there."
00:17:28.672,00:17:30.841,I barely made it out myself.
00:17:37.931,00:17:40.059,So these men that took the boy...
00:17:40.934,00:17:43.562,"they're out there right now, looking for you?"
00:17:51.695,00:17:53.155,"Wait, what?"
00:17:53.239,00:17:56.408,"There's someone in the building, a man, going from door to door."
00:17:56.492,00:17:58.285,-How do you know that? -Shh.
00:18:01.122,00:18:02.581,He's on the third floor already.
00:18:02.664,00:18:05.917,Smells like Prima cigarettes and discount cologne.
00:18:08.545,00:18:09.630,You'll smell him soon enough.
00:18:09.713,00:18:11.923,He really likes that cologne.
00:18:14.676,00:18:16.595,"You're looking at me like I'm crazy, right?"
00:18:16.678,00:18:18.472,Seems the appropriate response.
00:18:18.555,00:18:20.516,"There are some things I haven't told you about me, Claire."
00:18:20.599,00:18:22.601,You haven't told me anything about you.
00:18:22.684,00:18:25.187,All I know is you're very good at taking a beating.
00:18:28.857,00:18:30.984,That part I got from my dad.
00:18:34.655,00:18:36.740,"Get in there, come on. Watch your speed."
00:18:36.823,00:18:38.909,"Footwork! Footwork, come on."
00:18:38.992,00:18:40.494,Watch... Watch out! Oh!
00:18:44.123,00:18:46.167,"Way to take a punch, Jack."
00:18:53.465,00:18:55.384,"Hey, Jack, shake it off. You're looking good."
00:19:02.599,00:19:06.478,I tagged him a couple times. That kid is fast.
00:19:07.563,00:19:10.524,"So, how you... how you getting along with your new books?"
00:19:10.607,00:19:11.650,I'm working on it.
00:19:11.733,00:19:16.822,"Each grid is six possible dots, so each letter is a combination of those dots."
00:19:16.905,00:19:19.283,You have to feel for what's not there as much as what is.
00:19:19.366,00:19:21.910,That doesn't make any damn sense at all.
00:19:21.993,00:19:24.788,"Well, you know where a punch is going before it's thrown sometimes, right?"
00:19:26.832,00:19:29.501,"So, uh, you can make sense out of all of this?"
00:19:29.585,00:19:31.628,-I'm starting to. Here. -Hmm.
00:19:31.712,00:19:34.506,"Dot in the right corner, that's a C."
00:19:34.590,00:19:36.300,"Upper left, A."
00:19:36.383,00:19:38.760,T is hard. I get it confused with Q.
00:19:38.844,00:19:40.554,"Well, why don't they just make it feel like a T?"
00:19:40.637,00:19:43.515,"Well, they say this is faster once you get the hang of it."
00:19:49.896,00:19:51.232,"Oi, Battlin' Jack!"
00:19:55.694,00:19:58.864,"Hey, you wait. Couple months, you're gonna be reading Braille faster than I read normal."
00:20:14.296,00:20:16.340,Roscoe. Silke.
00:20:16.423,00:20:17.883,"Hello, Jack."
00:20:17.966,00:20:20.969,I heard about the wee one. That's a tough break.
00:20:24.723,00:20:26.725,Plenty of time to have more kids.
00:20:29.686,00:20:31.021,What can I do for you boys?
00:20:31.104,00:20:34.358,We come bearing glad tidings.
00:20:34.441,00:20:35.734,A match with Creel.
00:20:37.569,00:20:39.446,Creel?
00:20:39.530,00:20:40.906,How'd you pull that off?
00:20:41.532,00:20:47.078,Mr. Sweeney can be quite persuasive when he puts his mind to it.
00:20:47.162,00:20:48.622,It's me Irish charm.
00:20:48.705,00:20:50.957,Jesus! Creel?
00:20:56.087,00:20:58.089,You're doing us the favor.
00:20:58.173,00:21:01.260,It's 3-to-1 that you go the distance.
00:21:02.469,00:21:06.432,"You drop in the fifth, we're clearing 70%."
00:21:10.101,00:21:11.562,It's time to celebrate.
00:21:16.858,00:21:18.819,Thanks for the offer.
00:21:21.572,00:21:23.156,Did he just say pass?
00:21:26.493,00:21:27.661,But...
00:21:30.456,00:21:32.708,I got other things to worry about now.
00:21:33.625,00:21:35.794,"He don't want to do it, he don't do it."
00:21:36.837,00:21:40.341,Man makes his choice and we make ours.
00:21:40.424,00:21:43.093,"You wanna step into the ring, see how that plays out?"
00:21:44.678,00:21:47.013,"You gotta think of your family, Jack."
00:21:47.097,00:21:50.141,This could do a lot of good for your boy.
00:21:52.018,00:21:54.646,What else are you gonna leave him when you're gone?
00:22:09.536,00:22:12.080,I go down in the fifth.
00:22:12.163,00:22:15.291,There you go. That wasn't so hard.
00:22:24.551,00:22:25.594,This all you got?
00:22:25.677,00:22:27.846,"Yeah, it's for vegetables, not a knife fight."
00:22:29.431,00:22:30.641,He's at your neighbor's door.
00:22:30.724,00:22:32.976,You kidding me? Hey!
00:22:33.059,00:22:36.354,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You can barely stand up."
00:22:36.438,00:22:39.941,-That's what the knife's for. -Wait! Don't do this. Not in my home.
00:22:40.025,00:22:41.234,"Okay, nobody has to get hurt."
00:22:45.906,00:22:47.115,Please.
00:22:49.618,00:22:50.786,Who is it?
00:22:50.869,00:22:52.829,"NYPD, ma'am. Please open the door."
00:22:54.080,00:22:55.081,Okay.
00:22:56.542,00:22:57.584,Go.
00:22:59.795,00:23:01.505,I'll be right there.
00:23:08.512,00:23:09.846,Move over.
00:23:21.066,00:23:22.609,"Sorry to bother you so late, ma'am."
00:23:22.693,00:23:25.487,"My name is Detective Foster, with the 65th Precinct."
00:23:27.405,00:23:30.867,We're asking everyone if they've seen or heard anything unusual in the past few hours.
00:23:30.951,00:23:34.162,-What kind of disturbance? -Armed robbery.
00:23:34.245,00:23:37.999,Some dickhead in a black mask shot up a bodega on 38th.
00:23:38.083,00:23:39.375,Owner put up a fight.
00:23:39.460,00:23:42.212,"Perp fled on foot, leaving a trail of blood in this direction."
00:23:42.295,00:23:43.296,"Oh, my God."
00:23:43.379,00:23:45.882,"Probably long gone by now, but just in case, you know."
00:23:45.966,00:23:48.343,"You see anything, hear anything tonight?"
00:23:49.427,00:23:51.680,No... sorry.
00:23:51.763,00:23:53.849,"Just being thorough. You have a good night, ma'am."
00:23:53.932,00:23:55.350,"Thanks. You, too."
00:24:04.610,00:24:06.402,See? No reason to get all stabby.
00:24:06.487,00:24:10.198,"Boy, were you right about that cologne. What, does he dip himself in that crap?"
00:24:13.660,00:24:14.786,Mike!
00:24:42.689,00:24:43.774,What do we do now?
00:24:45.441,00:24:48.361,There's someone else one floor up watching us.
00:24:48.444,00:24:50.531,"Oh, no. He's young. He's scared."
00:24:57.203,00:24:59.247,He's the one who found you in the alley.
00:25:01.082,00:25:02.417,"He's seen my face, too?"
00:25:02.500,00:25:04.127,Yeah.
00:25:05.921,00:25:08.006,"Claire, go upstairs and get him."
00:25:08.089,00:25:11.092,We're gonna need help carrying Detective Foster to the roof.
00:25:13.344,00:25:15.180,What the hell are we going to the roof for?
00:25:16.264,00:25:18.809,Less chance of someone in the building hearing him scream.
00:25:24.731,00:25:25.857,Where are you?
00:25:25.941,00:25:30.028,"I'm introducing Karen to Josie's, and I have high hopes it's gonna go terribly."
00:25:30.111,00:25:32.405,Climb off whoever you're on and get down here.
00:25:36.367,00:25:40.205,"Oh, yeah, this place is a shithole... but it's our shithole."
00:25:40.288,00:25:46.169,"The city's tried to shut it down half a dozen times, but I helped Josie with the liens, and as a result, we get to drink for free."
00:25:51.382,00:25:52.843,Let's agree to disagree.
00:25:54.928,00:25:56.262,Thank you.
00:26:04.270,00:26:06.690,"You could do so much better, love."
00:26:06.773,00:26:10.318,"Thank you, Josie, but this is my employee..."
00:26:13.154,00:26:14.740,-Are we on a date? -Definitely not.
00:26:14.823,00:26:16.074,"Okay, good..."
00:26:16.157,00:26:18.576,because I was starting to worry you might be in love with me.
00:26:18.660,00:26:21.830,What other explanation could there be? You hang around my office all day.
00:26:23.665,00:26:26.292,You refuse to leave. You're always at your desk.
00:26:26.376,00:26:28.003,-I'm a good secretary! -No.
00:26:28.086,00:26:30.631,You gaze at me lovingly when you think I'm not looking.
00:26:31.798,00:26:34.801,What? You might. How would I know? I'm not looking.
00:26:34.885,00:26:36.136,Just let me live in it.
00:26:38.096,00:26:39.222,Oh.
00:26:45.896,00:26:48.439,I... think that's an eel.
00:26:51.151,00:26:53.654,-Really? -Let's get to the bottom and find out.
00:27:07.542,00:27:09.252,So you wanna talk about it?
00:27:21.890,00:27:24.851,I can't get Danny's blood out of the carpet.
00:27:27.062,00:27:30.523,It's like somebody spilled a wine bottle and it just won't come...
00:27:33.526,00:27:37.948,And a man broke into my apartment and tried to kill me.
00:27:39.115,00:27:42.285,He dented the wall where he bashed my head into it.
00:27:44.996,00:27:48.666,If that guy in the mask hadn't have been there...
00:27:53.546,00:27:56.967,My cousin does drywall. I'll call him first thing in the morning.
00:27:57.050,00:27:59.260,"It's not the apartment, Foggy."
00:27:59.344,00:28:00.804,I know.
00:28:01.763,00:28:04.182,I don't see the city anymore.
00:28:06.852,00:28:09.437,All that I see are its...
00:28:09.520,00:28:10.939,dark corners.
00:28:13.233,00:28:16.778,I look around this room and all that I see are threats.
00:28:19.364,00:28:20.741,These guys are harmless.
00:28:22.200,00:28:25.703,"Look, that's Tom Belkin."
00:28:25.787,00:28:27.831,He's the Road Captain in the Kitchen Hellions.
00:28:27.914,00:28:30.666,He organizes the food drive every Thanksgiving.
00:28:32.335,00:28:35.171,That's Rob Donohue.
00:28:35.255,00:28:36.256,His wife Mira...
00:28:36.339,00:28:39.050,she works at the dry cleaner around the corner from our office.
00:28:40.593,00:28:43.471,That's Clint Peterson. He...
00:28:43.554,00:28:45.306,"Okay, he is a criminal."
00:28:45.390,00:28:48.143,He's done time for larceny and distribution.
00:28:48.226,00:28:52.814,"But he's turning it around, and we are this close to getting his kids into Saint Agnes Daycare."
00:28:53.815,00:28:55.233,Saint Agnes!
00:28:59.695,00:29:00.781,Okay.
00:29:00.864,00:29:03.408,"You don't want to go home, you don't want to go home."
00:29:04.700,00:29:05.869,We can stay out all night.
00:29:29.559,00:29:31.853,You smashed the hell out of it with that extinguisher.
00:29:33.146,00:29:34.773,He had a badge.
00:29:36.441,00:29:38.443,-What if you're wrong? -I'm not.
00:29:40.528,00:29:44.490,-This is way past what I signed up for. -What exactly do you think that was?
00:29:47.368,00:29:49.495,"I found a man who needed help, so I helped him."
00:29:49.579,00:29:50.580,"Oh, yeah? That simple?"
00:29:54.750,00:29:56.711,Do you really want to get into this in front of him?
00:29:56.795,00:29:59.005,He's out.
00:30:03.259,00:30:06.596,"Okay, that right there, that's what I'm talking about."
00:30:06.679,00:30:17.440,"Okay, I find a guy in a dumpster who turns out to be some kind of blind vigilante who can do all of this really weird shit like smell cologne through walls and sense whether someone's unconscious or faking it."
00:30:17.523,00:30:21.236,"Slap on top of that, he can take an unbelievable amount of punishment without one damn complaint."
00:30:22.112,00:30:24.239,"-The last part's the Catholicism. -So, what?"
00:30:24.322,00:30:26.741,I'm supposed to take it on faith I'm on the right side of this?
00:30:26.825,00:30:31.454,You don't carry a masked man bleeding to death into your apartment on faith.
00:30:32.455,00:30:35.291,You knew which side you were on the moment you found me.
00:30:36.584,00:30:37.961,"Why'd you help me, Claire?"
00:30:42.132,00:30:43.716,I'm a nurse.
00:30:43.799,00:30:46.094,Work the ER at Metro-General.
00:30:46.177,00:30:48.804,"A few weeks ago, cops bring in three men."
00:30:49.805,00:30:52.767,"Said they were robbing tourists, beating them up pretty bad."
00:30:54.352,00:31:00.025,"Apparently, a man in a black mask took issue with their activities and decided to step in."
00:31:00.108,00:31:02.903,I counted nine broken bones between them.
00:31:06.197,00:31:10.451,"A few days after that, EMTs bring in a 19-year-old waitress, said..."
00:31:11.827,00:31:17.876,"some guy she knew waited for her after work in the parking lot, attacked her... tried to drag her in the alley."
00:31:17.959,00:31:23.589,"She said she screamed and screamed, and a man in a black mask heard her..."
00:31:31.181,00:31:33.016,"So, yeah, word's getting around."
00:31:35.226,00:31:37.520,And I want to believe in what you're doing.
00:31:37.603,00:31:39.355,I really do.
00:31:39.439,00:31:40.731,But this?
00:31:45.486,00:31:47.280,I know you're afraid.
00:31:53.078,00:31:55.330,You can't give in to the fear.
00:31:56.497,00:31:57.916,If you do...
00:31:59.000,00:32:00.793,men like this win.
00:32:05.924,00:32:09.052,Democracy cannot flourish amid hate.
00:32:09.135,00:32:11.554,Justice cannot take root amid rage.
00:32:11.637,00:32:14.224,We must dissent from the indifference.
00:32:14.307,00:32:16.226,We must dissent from the apathy.
00:32:16.309,00:32:18.103,We must dissent from the fear.
00:32:18.186,00:32:21.940,"Either you're actually reading all that, or you're making it up as you go along."
00:32:22.023,00:32:23.524,I don't know which is more impressive.
00:32:23.608,00:32:25.235,-It's Thurgood Marshall. -Hmm.
00:32:25.318,00:32:28.029,"Starting centerfielder for the Mets, right?"
00:32:28.113,00:32:29.905,You know who Thurgood Marshall is.
00:32:39.749,00:32:41.376,-How's it look? -It's...
00:32:42.293,00:32:43.586,it's red.
00:32:44.795,00:32:46.589,It's really red.
00:32:47.798,00:32:48.799,Can I?
00:32:51.636,00:32:52.887,Yeah.
00:33:10.405,00:33:12.073,-Good thing about red... -Huh?
00:33:12.157,00:33:13.574,...they can't tell how much you're bleeding.
00:33:13.658,00:33:16.244,"Hey, who says I'm even gonna get hit?"
00:33:17.245,00:33:19.622,We're Murdocks. We get hit a lot.
00:33:24.335,00:33:27.630,-Yeah... I guess we do. -But we get up.
00:33:32.010,00:33:33.636,We always get up.
00:33:51.237,00:33:53.198,-Too late to change it? -You can change it.
00:33:56.659,00:33:58.661,-You sure? -Yeah.
00:33:58.744,00:34:00.705,"Yeah, I'm sure. Listen, you gotta do this quick."
00:34:00.788,00:34:04.500,"Cash out the second Creel hits the mat. Don't wait. Okay, get a pen."
00:34:04.584,00:34:05.960,All right. Got it.
00:34:11.924,00:34:18.806,You're gonna deposit it into account number 004-82-56-882.
00:34:18.889,00:34:21.476,"-Account's in your name? -No, no, not under my name."
00:34:21.559,00:34:24.562,-It's under Matthew Murdock. -Matthew. Got it.
00:34:24.645,00:34:27.022,"Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Ed."
00:34:27.107,00:34:29.109,You're gonna want to lay low for a couple days after.
00:34:29.192,00:34:30.276,Can I do anything for you?
00:34:30.360,00:34:33.238,"Nah, don't worry about me. I got it covered."
00:34:53.924,00:34:55.343,"Hey, it's, uh..."
00:34:55.426,00:34:56.719,it's me.
00:34:58.429,00:35:01.516,I'm about to go do something... Well...
00:35:01.599,00:35:03.434,I'm about to go be me.
00:35:04.685,00:35:08.314,You know better than anybody that doesn't always go so well.
00:35:09.315,00:35:12.818,"I don't know how this is gonna go, but if I were a betting man..."
00:35:12.902,00:35:16.281,Matty's gonna need you. More than ever.
00:35:18.241,00:35:19.534,"Look after him, okay?"
00:35:19.617,00:35:23.078,"And I know what I'm asking here, but he's a good kid."
00:35:24.330,00:35:26.957,He sure as hell didn't get that from me.
00:35:27.041,00:35:28.209,So...
00:35:30.085,00:35:31.879,It's better this way.
00:35:33.923,00:35:35.341,Just once...
00:35:37.427,00:35:40.638,I want Matty to hear people cheer for his old man.
00:35:42.807,00:35:44.142,Just once.
00:35:55.986,00:35:57.905,Matt!
00:35:57.988,00:36:00.241,"Matt, come on! Get up!"
00:36:02.660,00:36:04.078,"-Oh, no. -Not a euphemism."
00:36:05.663,00:36:06.789,"Matt, I know you're in there!"
00:36:08.333,00:36:10.042,"-Here, you talk to him. -Okay."
00:36:12.212,00:36:13.713,Matt!
00:36:13.796,00:36:23.306,"Matt, it's Karen... and I am... very, very sorry about this, and if I were you, I would not come to this door."
00:36:28.603,00:36:31.689,And we are now filled with mighty eel strength!
00:36:31.772,00:36:33.816,"-Matt! -It's true. Matt, come on!"
00:36:33.899,00:36:35.901,-Come on! -Come on!
00:36:38.696,00:36:40.448,We're gonna go to the fish market!
00:36:41.657,00:36:44.785,"Oh, no. Oh, Foggy."
00:36:44.869,00:36:47.121,"-Oh, hi, Fran. -Oh..."
00:36:48.706,00:36:50.708,-Sorry. -We're sorry. We'll be quiet.
00:36:52.460,00:36:54.545,I'm gonna buy a bluefin.
00:36:54.629,00:36:56.881,"I'm buying a bluefin, Murdock!"
00:37:01.176,00:37:04.179,Okay... we've got what?
00:37:07.892,00:37:11.186,Let's brush you up on some Japanese auctioneering terms.
00:37:13.022,00:37:14.106,Do what?
00:37:14.189,00:37:19.737,You haven't lived until you've argued with a 90-year-old Okinawa survivor about sturgeon meat.
00:37:22.240,00:37:23.991,Thank you.
00:37:24.074,00:37:25.868,I needed this. I really needed this.
00:37:25.951,00:37:28.162,"But it's late, and we should go home."
00:37:28.246,00:37:29.539,-Are you kidding me? -Yes.
00:37:29.622,00:37:32.207,"After what you told me, I'm never going home again."
00:37:32.292,00:37:34.794,Men are waiting in the dark corners of this world to prey on us.
00:37:34.877,00:37:35.878,"Oh, God."
00:37:38.798,00:37:41.342,We must band together. We must never sleep.
00:37:41.426,00:37:43.511,We must remain vigilant.
00:37:43.594,00:37:46.347,Here in the lights of Hell's Kitchen.
00:37:46.431,00:37:47.973,Never sleep!
00:38:22.800,00:38:24.385,Here's how this is gonna work.
00:38:25.428,00:38:28.848,I'm gonna ask you some questions. You're gonna answer them.
00:38:28.931,00:38:30.808,If you're lying to me...
00:38:34.269,00:38:35.896,and I will be unhappy.
00:38:37.482,00:38:38.566,Where's the boy?
00:38:39.775,00:38:41.068,He's dead.
00:38:48.868,00:38:50.035,Where's the boy?
00:38:51.203,00:38:54.164,"What do you care? If he's not dead yet, he will be."
00:38:54.248,00:38:56.959,-Why did you take him? -Figured you'd come running.
00:38:57.585,00:38:58.878,And after I was dead?
00:38:58.961,00:39:02.297,"Sell the kid, like all the others."
00:39:06.552,00:39:09.514,I was telling the truth on that one.
00:39:09.597,00:39:10.640,I know.
00:39:13.851,00:39:17.062,-Who do you sell the children to? -I don't know.
00:39:17.146,00:39:18.981,Whoever has the money.
00:39:19.899,00:39:21.526,Where's the boy?
00:39:21.609,00:39:24.654,So you find him. So what?
00:39:24.737,00:39:25.863,We'll take another.
00:39:26.864,00:39:29.825,"Kill me, somebody takes my place."
00:39:29.909,00:39:33.162,"Long as people are buying, we'll be selling."
00:39:34.079,00:39:35.790,Nothing you do tonight will change that.
00:39:36.874,00:39:40.961,But go ahead. Keep hitting me. Let's see who drops first.
00:39:42.380,00:39:44.382,Try stabbing him in his trigeminal nerve.
00:39:46.008,00:39:47.468,Where is it?
00:39:47.552,00:39:50.179,"Go in through here, right above the eye."
00:39:50.262,00:39:54.099,That's the supraorbital foramen. You want to go in right under there.
00:39:59.980,00:40:02.357,I might do some serious damage if you squirm.
00:40:04.985,00:40:06.529,How will I know when I find it?
00:40:07.613,00:40:08.739,He'll tell you.
00:40:28.843,00:40:30.219,what you said before.
00:40:31.929,00:40:38.978,"I kill you, somebody takes your place, but they'll end up back here just like you, and sooner or later, one of you is gonna tell me what I need to know."
00:40:51.281,00:40:52.783,This is important.
00:40:54.243,00:40:56.954,"Listen, I need you to know why I'm hurting you."
00:40:58.205,00:40:59.289,It's not just the boy.
00:40:59.957,00:41:02.251,I'm doing this 'cause I enjoy it.
00:41:03.503,00:41:04.795,"No, no, no!"
00:41:09.550,00:41:11.051,Where is he?
00:41:15.347,00:41:18.601,Underneath Troika restaurant. Eleventh and 44th.
00:41:26.191,00:41:27.401,They'll be waiting for you.
00:41:28.528,00:41:31.196,"If you're lucky, they'll kill you before they start in on the boy."
00:41:32.532,00:41:35.743,It would be a shame for you to have to watch what they do to him-- Oh!
00:41:42.249,00:41:44.418,He landed in the dumpster you pulled me out of.
00:41:44.502,00:41:45.878,Is he dead?
00:41:50.591,00:41:52.051,He'll live.
00:41:53.302,00:41:57.222,You need to get your things and leave. Don't tell anyone where you're going.
00:42:05.648,00:42:07.858,and he won't be alone next time.
00:42:07.942,00:42:09.276,But he didn't see my face.
00:42:09.359,00:42:12.404,"That was just for effect, to scare him."
00:42:12.487,00:42:14.198,He knew you were lying when you answered your door.
00:42:20.621,00:42:23.541,Do you have somewhere you can go?
00:42:23.624,00:42:27.086,I'm cat-sitting for... a woman I work with.
00:42:28.503,00:42:29.880,Her brother's sick. She's in Oklahoma.
00:42:29.964,00:42:31.048,What's the address?
00:42:32.007,00:42:33.175,Why?
00:42:34.426,00:42:37.972,"I'm thinking if I make it through the night, I may need some help getting patched up."
00:42:43.644,00:42:45.605,Tenth and 54th.
00:42:47.022,00:42:50.568,"Apartment 412, um, in the building above the liquor store."
00:42:55.322,00:42:56.406,Hey.
00:42:58.701,00:43:00.494,"Thank you, Claire."
00:43:06.083,00:43:07.459,I don't believe you.
00:43:08.753,00:43:10.254,What you said.
00:43:13.257,00:43:15.635,I don't believe you enjoy this.
00:43:41.243,00:43:46.081,weighing in at 164 pounds...
00:43:46.165,00:43:49.251,"from Hell's Kitchen, New York..."
00:44:01.847,00:44:03.182,"Get him, Dad! Get him!"
00:44:03.265,00:44:06.310,Creel is rocked! Murdock won't let him out of the corner!
00:44:12.274,00:44:13.317,Yes! Yes!
00:44:15.110,00:44:18.155,Battlin' Jack Murdock has defeated Crusher Creel!
00:44:18.238,00:44:19.657,"Yeah, Dad! Yeah!"
00:45:04.659,00:45:06.370,"Oh, oh, hang on there, son."
00:45:06.453,00:45:09.289,-What's the hurry? -I think that's my dad.
00:45:09.957,00:45:11.625,"Jesus, Ray, the kid's blind."
00:45:11.708,00:45:12.918,"Hey, wait!"
00:45:21.886,00:45:22.970,Dad?
00:45:27.724,00:45:28.976,Daddy!
00:45:30.685,00:45:32.354,Daddy!
00:45:35.065,00:45:36.400,Daddy!
00:45:41.196,00:45:42.948,Daddy!
00:46:05.679,00:46:09.266,I want to go home. I want my daddy.
00:50:38.327,00:50:40.120,I know you're scared.
00:50:41.871,00:50:44.249,But I'm here to help you.
00:50:44.333,00:50:45.584,Okay?
00:03:05.227,00:03:07.687,Um... I'm Karen.
00:03:08.855,00:03:13.401,"Karen Page. I don't know if Ben ever-- Karen, yes."
00:03:13.485,00:03:15.445,He talked about you all the time.
00:03:16.738,00:03:17.780,He did?
00:03:17.864,00:03:19.949,He thought you were something else.
00:03:20.032,00:03:24.454,The way you wouldn't let go until you got to the truth.
00:03:24.537,00:03:26.373,He admired that.
00:03:27.164,00:03:32.044,"We never got around to having kids, too busy with this or that, but..."
00:03:32.128,00:03:36.007,"if we had, I think he would have wanted one like you."
00:03:41.846,00:03:43.348,I think it's my fault...
00:03:44.849,00:03:45.975,what happened to Ben.
00:03:46.058,00:03:53.233,I pushed him into a story that he didn't want-- Ben Urich never got pushed into doing anything he didn't want to do.
00:03:54.150,00:03:55.943,He was a reporter.
00:03:56.986,00:03:58.946,That's what he lived for.
00:04:03.493,00:04:05.953,what he had to do.
00:04:06.037,00:04:08.039,We should be getting back.
00:04:11.418,00:04:13.420,"It was nice to meet you, Karen."
00:04:13.503,00:04:15.380,Is there... Is there anything that you need?
00:04:15.463,00:04:17.299,-Anything at all that I-- -No.
00:04:17.382,00:04:20.009,Ben's taken care of all that.
00:04:23.220,00:04:29.519,He took out a policy years back when that river water story turned ugly.
00:04:31.103,00:04:33.481,He always took care of me.
00:05:00.633,00:05:02.051,"That bad, huh?"
00:05:02.134,00:05:03.803,He was a good man.
00:05:05.347,00:05:06.848,And he's gone...
00:05:09.183,00:05:11.769,because I haven't stopped what's happening to this city.
00:05:15.272,00:05:16.899,You've done everything you can.
00:05:18.776,00:05:20.445,A lot you probably shouldn't have.
00:05:21.404,00:05:22.989,And here we are.
00:05:53.811,00:05:57.231,I thought Ben said he didn't have any evidence Ellison was taking money from Fisk.
00:05:57.314,00:06:00.652,"No, but it makes sense. I mean, it explains..."
00:06:05.823,00:06:08.242,Do you know what makes this worse?
00:06:13.456,00:06:14.832,Didn't even show up.
00:06:15.542,00:06:17.585,You said he left a message.
00:06:20.463,00:06:23.466,saying he had something more important to do than come to Ben's funeral.
00:06:23.550,00:06:24.926,"Come on, he wouldn't say that."
00:06:29.180,00:06:30.848,"It's my fault, Karen..."
00:06:32.183,00:06:33.435,all of this with Foggy.
00:06:34.060,00:06:37.146,"No, everyone shares the blame in a relationship."
00:06:37.229,00:06:40.149,That's... just the way that it works.
00:06:40.232,00:06:42.610,"No, not always."
00:06:43.653,00:06:46.405,"Why don't you go home, get some rest, huh?"
00:06:47.615,00:06:48.866,I can't.
00:06:52.787,00:06:55.414,"Every time I close my eyes, I see..."
00:06:58.501,00:07:00.878,What if he finds out that I...
00:07:05.257,00:07:07.677,That I was with Ben...
00:07:07.760,00:07:09.053,at Saint Benezet.
00:07:09.136,00:07:10.972,What if he finds out that I spoke to his mother too?
00:07:11.055,00:07:14.016,"If that happens, we will deal with it."
00:07:14.100,00:07:15.184,How?
00:07:16.393,00:07:21.858,"I mean, the news barely mentioned what happened to Ben because Fisk pays off the media."
00:07:21.941,00:07:26.320,"And the police haven't arrested anyone for it because Fisk pays them off, too."
00:07:28.656,00:07:32.619,"How do you stop someone like that, someone who has so much?"
00:07:35.287,00:07:36.914,-He's gonna find out what I did. -No.
00:07:36.998,00:07:40.001,"He's going to find out, and he's gonna come after me just like he came after Ben."
00:07:40.084,00:07:42.336,"I told you I would keep you safe, Karen..."
00:07:42.419,00:07:44.922,when he came after you over Union Allied. That hasn't changed.
00:07:46.758,00:07:51.554,"Everyone that's taken money from him, everyone that's helped him tear this city apart..."
00:07:53.765,00:07:56.643,they're all gonna get what's coming to them...
00:07:56.726,00:07:58.227,along with Wilson Fisk.
00:08:13.701,00:08:14.952,You should be in bed.
00:08:15.036,00:08:16.871,I was calling for you.
00:08:18.205,00:08:19.749,"I'm sorry, I..."
00:08:21.959,00:08:23.169,I didn't hear you.
00:08:28.716,00:08:30.134,Anything interesting?
00:08:31.511,00:08:33.012,Just a transfer of funds.
00:08:33.095,00:08:37.308,Wesley made the arrangements for me to get you out of the country.
00:08:37.391,00:08:40.937,-You know I won't leave without you. -I'm not asking.
00:08:43.856,00:08:46.568,"I'm just reviewing them, and then I'll move the funds back."
00:08:47.819,00:08:49.236,Is everything all right?
00:08:51.823,00:08:53.658,"It's just the numbers, I..."
00:08:55.076,00:08:57.704,I'll have Leland take a look at them...
00:08:59.080,00:09:01.373,"well, just to make sure."
00:09:18.182,00:09:21.310,after squeezing us for another extra 10%.
00:09:21.393,00:09:25.898,"Bright side, you'll be able to build whatever you want on your properties now."
00:09:29.443,00:09:32.404,But we will need to find a replacement for Gao's heroin trade.
00:09:33.573,00:09:38.661,"Without it, we might have some off-the-books cash flow issues down the road."
00:09:40.913,00:09:43.332,What's the word on what happened with her?
00:09:43.415,00:09:44.792,Looks like she's in the wind.
00:09:45.752,00:09:50.673,"Wouldn't have expected it, but maybe she's not the ally we thought she was."
00:09:50.757,00:09:53.092,"Mmm, maybe she's not."
00:09:57.972,00:09:59.932,What's this?
00:10:00.016,00:10:04.520,I asked Wesley to transfer funds for me the night before we found him.
00:10:04.604,00:10:06.773,I thought financials was my job.
00:10:06.856,00:10:08.733,"Yes, that's why I wanted you to have a look at these."
00:10:08.816,00:10:12.319,There seem to be some irregularities with my accounts.
00:10:13.655,00:10:17.283,Of course there are. I move money around all the time.
00:10:18.075,00:10:22.038,"It's a shell game to keep the SEC off our backs, it's nothing."
00:10:26.709,00:10:29.253,Your hand's shaking.
00:10:32.882,00:10:35.217,"Then why are you sweating, Leland?"
00:10:44.185,00:10:46.646,I figured you'd find out sooner or later.
00:10:49.148,00:10:51.150,What's a guy gonna do?
00:10:51.233,00:10:53.360,"Wesley found out, didn't he?"
00:10:54.946,00:10:56.572,He confronted you...
00:10:57.657,00:10:58.741,and you shot him.
00:11:03.037,00:11:06.165,"But you had something to do with the benefit, didn't you?"
00:11:06.248,00:11:07.249,You and Gao?
00:11:07.333,00:11:10.712,"She's gone, you're stealing from me."
00:11:12.296,00:11:13.965,You tried to kill me.
00:11:19.345,00:11:26.227,The poisonings at the benefit were just to make it look like someone was trying to get at you.
00:11:44.370,00:11:47.289,We just wanted to nudge you back on track.
00:11:48.332,00:11:49.625,But...
00:11:51.794,00:11:55.047,"obviously that went south, so..."
00:11:55.965,00:11:58.050,we will be parting ways...
00:11:59.676,00:12:02.721,and I'll be taking half your assets with me.
00:12:07.309,00:12:13.065,"That's exactly what you're gonna do, because I have Detective Hoffman."
00:12:13.775,00:12:18.195,Hoffman never left the city after he murdered his partner in the hospital.
00:12:22.449,00:12:25.327,If I don't check in every 24 hours...
00:12:26.412,00:12:29.040,Hoffman gets dropped off to the Feds...
00:12:30.249,00:12:32.418,tells them all the shit he's been up to.
00:12:35.462,00:12:38.049,he's a frightened little worm.
00:12:41.010,00:12:43.429,Ten million buys a lot of courage.
00:12:45.222,00:12:48.600,"He thinks he's going into witness protection, get the money on the other side."
00:12:48.684,00:12:54.773,"Now, I know you'll get to him before he cashes in, but by then the damage will already have been done..."
00:12:55.524,00:13:00.112,and everything you've been fighting so hard for will come tumbling down.
00:13:07.328,00:13:10.497,hiding assets overseas for pricks like you.
00:13:12.208,00:13:19.798,"My son and I will be just another transaction, disappearing into the tax-exempt ether."
00:13:20.466,00:13:22.426,But I'm a fair sort.
00:13:23.802,00:13:25.847,That's why I'm only taking half your money.
00:13:26.638,00:13:29.433,"You go your way, I go mine."
00:13:29.516,00:13:32.019,Not what I'd call win-win...
00:13:32.937,00:13:35.731,but it's as close as we're gonna get with this.
00:13:36.648,00:13:37.733,So...
00:13:39.318,00:13:41.863,we on the same page?
00:13:44.615,00:13:46.283,No...
00:13:46.367,00:13:47.910,I don't think we are.
00:13:57.794,00:13:59.421,You hurt her!
00:13:59.505,00:14:00.631,"Wait, wait!"
00:14:01.340,00:14:03.384,You hurt Vanessa!
00:14:21.235,00:14:23.570,Sweep the city.
00:14:23.654,00:14:26.615,Find Hoffman and put a bullet in his head.
00:14:53.600,00:14:54.936,How'd you know I was here?
00:14:56.062,00:14:58.064,Known about your outlet for a while.
00:15:01.858,00:15:03.527,Now I know better.
00:15:07.448,00:15:10.826,"Thought you'd be out punching people in the head, or whatever you do."
00:15:12.328,00:15:15.039,I was. Paid Ben's editor a visit.
00:15:15.122,00:15:17.083,-Ellison? -Yeah.
00:15:17.166,00:15:19.293,Karen thinks he's working for Fisk.
00:15:19.376,00:15:20.377,Did he talk?
00:15:24.756,00:15:27.468,Wife and kid picked him up outside the office.
00:15:27.551,00:15:29.261,Try it again tomorrow night.
00:15:36.227,00:15:39.896,Looking like you have some anger issues. Wanna talk about it?
00:15:39.981,00:15:42.108,"You're not my priest, Foggy..."
00:15:42.191,00:15:45.444,who you might have met if you'd shown up for Ben's funeral.
00:15:45.527,00:15:46.988,Karen upset?
00:15:52.076,00:15:54.828,I told her this was my fault...
00:15:54.911,00:15:56.372,all of this between you and me.
00:16:04.671,00:16:06.507,"Yeah, I could tell."
00:16:08.300,00:16:12.513,I was on my way to the service and I got a call...
00:16:12.596,00:16:13.680,from Marci.
00:16:13.764,00:16:14.806,From Marci?
00:16:14.890,00:16:17.559,She's been helping me...
00:16:20.437,00:16:28.195,"Whole stack of documents on their dealings with Fisk, Ben is dead, Foggy, because he got dragged into this."
00:16:28.279,00:16:29.696,And now you're doing the same with your ex.
00:16:29.780,00:16:32.074,-We're being careful. -This has to stop.
00:16:32.158,00:16:33.617,Fisk has to...
00:16:38.497,00:16:39.665,I have to stop this...
00:16:41.583,00:16:43.794,before there's no one left to bury.
00:16:43.877,00:16:45.337,Matt...
00:16:45.421,00:16:46.422,Matt!
00:16:47.548,00:16:50.509,"Last time you went after Fisk, I found you half dead!"
00:16:50.592,00:16:51.885,More than half.
00:16:51.968,00:16:56.015,"You go after him in the mask again, he might kill you."
00:16:56.098,00:17:00.269,"Or you might kill him, which would probably have the same effect on someone as Catholic as you are."
00:17:00.352,00:17:02.188,What am I supposed to do?
00:17:03.272,00:17:04.523,How do I stop him?
00:17:04.606,00:17:06.525,"By using the law, Matt."
00:17:07.943,00:17:11.113,Like you told me and Karen to do. That's how we take him down.
00:17:12.614,00:17:13.657,We?
00:17:15.701,00:17:17.619,Thought Nelson and Murdock were over.
00:17:20.247,00:17:25.377,"There's nothing I want more than to find a way back to where we were, but..."
00:17:28.047,00:17:29.381,I don't know if we can.
00:17:30.341,00:17:31.883,"No, we can't."
00:17:34.053,00:17:37.514,"But maybe we can find a way to move forward, Foggy."
00:17:41.435,00:17:43.229,Things are bad enough around here.
00:17:43.312,00:17:45.856,Last thing I need is to be seen chumming it up with the enemy.
00:17:45.939,00:17:47.733,Especially ones bringing cigars for my mom.
00:17:47.816,00:17:48.942,These are the good ones.
00:17:49.025,00:17:50.694,So all the other times you were buying cheap?
00:17:50.777,00:17:52.571,How are things bad? What's going on?
00:17:52.654,00:17:54.990,You hear about that warehouse fire a few days back?
00:17:56.783,00:17:59.161,it was full of illegal immigrants and a shit ton of heroin.
00:17:59.245,00:18:00.537,And that guy in the mask was there.
00:18:00.621,00:18:01.955,I had a run-in with him leaving the scene.
00:18:02.038,00:18:03.999,-What happened? -I got my ass beat.
00:18:04.083,00:18:06.960,"But this guy, I mean, I don't know, what he said, it got me thinking."
00:18:07.586,00:18:10.506,-I heard he has that effect on people. -He was working with Ben Urich.
00:18:10.589,00:18:12.007,How do you know that?
00:18:12.091,00:18:15.010,"Because we were working with Ben, too, on the same story."
00:18:15.094,00:18:17.388,Where are you with the investigation? Any leads?
00:18:17.471,00:18:19.140,You know I can't be talking to you about that.
00:18:19.223,00:18:22.309,Story Ben was working on was about Wilson Fisk.
00:18:24.019,00:18:26.021,He said half the cops in the 15th are in his pocket.
00:18:26.105,00:18:27.106,You believe him?
00:18:27.189,00:18:29.191,"No, I've seen things make me wonder."
00:18:29.275,00:18:31.152,Ben found Fisk's mom.
00:18:31.235,00:18:33.069,Told him some things Fisk wouldn't want out there.
00:18:33.154,00:18:34.571,And you think he killed him for it?
00:18:38.909,00:18:40.119,Not even Urich's.
00:18:40.202,00:18:43.038,"All his files and notebooks are gone, hard drives wiped clean."
00:18:43.872,00:18:45.541,Fisk's mom got the same treatment.
00:18:45.624,00:18:48.585,"Gone, no record of her at the care facility Ben found her at."
00:19:04.268,00:19:06.978,"I'll reach out to the C.I.'s, see if anybody's got a line."
00:19:07.062,00:19:11.107,Owlsley has Hoffman stashed in the city. We'll find the little rat shit.
00:19:12.609,00:19:15.362,"-Nothing else you can give us? -No, I've said too much already!"
00:19:15.446,00:19:17.156,And this guy isn't even listening.
00:19:17.239,00:19:18.449,"-Just standing there, man. -I'm sorry."
00:19:19.908,00:19:23.745,"It don't matter. The way things are going around here, I'm thinking about taking an early pension."
00:19:23.829,00:19:25.247,Move my mom somewhere warm.
00:19:25.331,00:19:26.873,Be a shame.
00:19:26.957,00:19:29.042,The only cop on the force we know for sure is honest.
00:19:29.125,00:19:31.127,Never see Serpico?
00:19:31.212,00:19:35.048,Honest cops are usually the ones get shot in the face.
00:19:35.131,00:19:37.426,"-Another dead end. -No, it wasn't."
00:19:37.509,00:19:39.928,"The cop on the phone, I had a run-in with him before in the mask."
00:19:40.011,00:19:41.305,He works for Fisk?
00:19:41.388,00:19:44.308,He was talking to someone about Hoffman. They're looking for him.
00:19:46.310,00:19:48.270,"From what I could tell, Owlsley has him holed up somewhere."
00:19:48.354,00:19:50.606,"Fisk wants him found, bad."
00:19:50.689,00:19:53.359,"Hell yeah, he does. Hoffman could blow this thing wide open."
00:19:53.442,00:19:55.569,Only if we get to him first.
00:19:59.281,00:20:02.659,You know what doesn't make you want to gouge your eyes out?
00:20:02.743,00:20:06.079,"Cold cuts, Italian meats, cheeses."
00:20:07.038,00:20:08.415,Why did I become a lawyer again?
00:20:08.499,00:20:09.958,To make lots of money.
00:20:11.835,00:20:13.254,"That didn't work out so good, did it?"
00:20:15.005,00:20:19.134,"Could have had my own deli, an apron with my name on it and everything."
00:20:21.970,00:20:25.391,"Oh, it's just this. It's the way it should be."
00:20:31.730,00:20:32.773,It's a start.
00:20:34.941,00:20:36.568,"Uh, you, uh, find anything?"
00:20:37.110,00:20:40.656,"Well, there's thousands and thousands of pages, I..."
00:20:41.448,00:20:44.200,How'd Marci even get this out of Landman and Zack without anyone noticing?
00:20:44.285,00:20:47.162,She can be very... distracting.
00:20:49.248,00:20:51.500,Concentrate on anything pertaining to Silver and Brent.
00:20:51.583,00:20:55.796,"Uh, liens, development, property holdings, anything that might point to where Owlsley is holding Hoffman."
00:20:56.630,00:20:59.883,"The corruption, the bombings, the cops that got shot, Hoffman knows it all."
00:20:59.966,00:21:03.178,"He turns, it won't just bring Fisk down."
00:21:03.262,00:21:06.723,It'll prove your man in the mask isn't the asshole everyone thinks he is.
00:21:06.807,00:21:09.851,"You really think he'll go against Fisk, even if we find him?"
00:21:09.935,00:21:13.021,A lot of friction between Fisk and the other players he's been working with.
00:21:14.273,00:21:19.611,"Bombed the hell out of the Russians, the Yakuza went underground, Chinese heroin went up in flames. Now Owlsley's making a move."
00:21:19.695,00:21:25.075,You don't get to be the man on top without making enemies looking to tear you down.
00:21:27.953,00:21:29.413,It's just something Ben told me.
00:21:30.205,00:21:31.873,He's right. You don't.
00:21:35.168,00:21:38.339,So how'd you find out about Owlsley? You never said.
00:21:40.131,00:21:42.343,Your... pal in the mask.
00:21:42.426,00:21:44.720,You saw him?
00:21:44.803,00:21:46.763,"Oh, my God. When? Where?"
00:21:51.727,00:21:53.312,"...where we used to, um..."
00:21:54.145,00:21:55.772,All that matters is he...
00:22:06.408,00:22:08.034,and we have no idea if these records are complete.
00:22:08.118,00:22:12.163,"Even if they are, it doesn't mean that Owlsley's using company funds to stash Hoffman."
00:22:12.247,00:22:14.207,Owlsley's a man of financial privilege.
00:22:14.290,00:22:16.793,I never met one that used his own money when he could use someone else's.
00:22:16.877,00:22:20.672,"I'll call Marci, see if she found anything else might help narrow the search."
00:22:22.758,00:22:26.762,"All right, this is a rundown of all of Silver and Brent's real estate holdings."
00:22:26.845,00:22:29.973,There's 187 just spread out across New York State.
00:22:30.056,00:22:31.099,We already looked at that.
00:22:31.182,00:22:36.312,"Well, yeah, but the same rundown dated for the next day, it lists only 186."
00:22:37.313,00:22:40.316,Silver and Brent liquidate and acquire new properties all the time.
00:22:40.401,00:22:41.610,One of them probably just sold that day.
00:22:41.693,00:22:45.238,"Well, I mean, that's what I thought, but... look."
00:22:45.321,00:22:48.700,Look at the balance after the property disappears from the record.
00:22:50.243,00:22:51.453,It hasn't changed.
00:22:51.537,00:22:55.373,"So, if it was sold, wouldn't that be reflected in the profit-loss?"
00:22:55.457,00:22:58.585,Unless someone's trying to hide the fact the property's been taken off the records altogether.
00:23:02.338,00:23:03.757,Or it could just be a clerical error.
00:23:03.840,00:23:05.383,-Where's the property? -Uh...
00:23:06.968,00:23:08.178,Hell's Kitchen.
00:23:09.430,00:23:12.390,"Right, stay here, keep looking through the documents in case we're wrong."
00:23:12.474,00:23:14.726,I'll go to the 15th and tell Brett what we found.
00:23:14.810,00:23:16.144,Couldn't you just call him?
00:23:16.227,00:23:19.856,Fisk might be tapping the police lines for all we know. Keep working.
00:23:25.195,00:23:26.572,"You're not going to the 15th, are you?"
00:23:26.655,00:23:30.075,"I trust Brett, but he's just one cop. He couldn't handle it alone."
00:23:34.996,00:23:38.792,This is the part where law meets reality.
00:23:38.875,00:23:42.546,Either I put on the mask or we risk losing Hoffman and Fisk wins.
00:24:01.773,00:24:02.774,Yes?
00:24:03.942,00:24:05.276,Thank you.
00:24:06.820,00:24:08.113,Send the closest team.
00:24:09.239,00:24:10.699,No survivors.
00:24:45.984,00:24:48.987,"There's a, uh, chicken parm..."
00:24:49.070,00:24:50.572,Give it here.
00:24:50.656,00:24:52.699,-He call yet? -No.
00:24:54.618,00:24:56.912,"Owlsley don't call by then, -we can get out of this dump. -Yeah."
00:24:59.455,00:25:00.999,You got my meatball sub?
00:25:03.334,00:25:04.836,Here you go.
00:25:22.854,00:25:24.439,"Hey, Carl."
00:25:26.107,00:25:28.443,Been wondering where you got to.
00:26:12.070,00:26:14.990,"You have an opportunity here, Detective."
00:26:16.241,00:26:19.119,"By turning evidence on Fisk, you can set things right."
00:26:19.828,00:26:22.038,If that's what you want.
00:26:22.122,00:26:27.043,"If not, you can sit here playing with yourself until Fisk sends more men to kill you."
00:26:30.881,00:26:32.007,Decide.
00:26:33.216,00:26:36.052,It won't make a difference. He owns the cops.
00:26:36.136,00:26:38.263,-I'll be dead before I can testify-- -Not all of them.
00:26:38.346,00:26:41.683,"Turn yourself in to Brett Mahoney, you can trust him."
00:26:41.767,00:26:44.770,And he knows a couple of lawyers that can't be bought. They can help you.
00:26:44.853,00:26:45.854,Yeah.
00:26:47.188,00:26:48.481,Thanks for the tip.
00:26:56.156,00:26:58.574,I'll be following you to make sure you get to the precinct alive.
00:26:59.200,00:27:05.832,"Try to run, try to do anything other than what I just told you, you'll wish I never saved you from that bullet."
00:27:39.074,00:27:41.159,I need to make a statement.
00:27:47.457,00:27:52.212,our client is willing to be placed in protective custody and waive all considerations for immunity.
00:27:52.295,00:27:55.131,-In exchange for what? -Nothing.
00:27:55.215,00:28:03.890,Detective Hoffman regrets his involvement in Wilson Fisk's criminal enterprise and seeks only to unburden himself in the eyes of God and the state of New York.
00:28:04.933,00:28:05.934,Detective?
00:28:08.854,00:28:12.148,"I've taken money, a lot of money, to do things for..."
00:28:15.110,00:28:16.194,For Fisk.
00:28:17.237,00:28:18.363,I'm not the only one.
00:28:18.446,00:28:22.408,"There's cops, lawyers, judges..."
00:28:23.952,00:28:26.037,...at least one senator I know of.
00:28:26.121,00:28:30.751,"Start from the beginning. Names, dates, I want it all."
00:28:35.881,00:28:39.718,by a man working for Wilson Fisk...
00:28:39.801,00:28:41.386,18 months ago.
00:31:07.823,00:31:09.659,that you accepted payoffs from Wilson Fisk?
00:31:13.329,00:31:16.624,...a temporary strike when they walked out of their jobs...
00:31:19.502,00:31:22.005,-Wait for my call. -What they're saying on the news...
00:31:23.673,00:31:25.258,-So we have to leave now. -It's too late.
00:31:25.341,00:31:26.592,-There's nothing we can do-- -No!
00:31:26.676,00:31:28.970,There's nothing that we can do to keep this from happening. Nothing.
00:31:31.139,00:31:33.349,I need you to do something for me.
00:31:34.225,00:31:35.768,Listen very carefully.
00:31:46.862,00:31:49.324,Do you understand everything I've told you?
00:31:54.829,00:31:56.372,We have a warrant for the arrest of Wilson Fisk.
00:32:01.877,00:32:04.797,"Wilson Fisk, you're under arrest for racketeering."
00:32:04.880,00:32:06.967,-You have the right to remain silent. -I want to ask you...
00:32:07.050,00:32:09.219,Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.
00:32:09.302,00:32:10.886,-Vanessa... -You have the right to an attorney.
00:32:10.971,00:32:12.638,-...you are my heart. -If you cannot afford an attorney...
00:32:12.722,00:32:14.057,-You're everything. -...one will be provided to you.
00:32:14.140,00:32:15.683,Do you understand these rights?
00:32:35.870,00:32:41.042,How do you respond to the allegations that you were involved with the Ranskahov brothers and that you were responsible for the bombings?
00:32:45.546,00:32:47.215,"Mr. Fisk, what about your better tomorrow?"
00:32:47.298,00:32:48.466,Mr. Fisk?
00:32:56.975,00:33:01.937,The man once hailed as the savior of Hell's Kitchen is now believed to have been involved...
00:33:06.859,00:33:09.154,"And we are the ones that made it happen, the three of us."
00:33:09.237,00:33:12.823,"-And Marci. -And Marci, God bless her designer pumps."
00:33:12.907,00:33:14.575,Maybe she's not that bad after all.
00:33:14.659,00:33:16.494,Woman does have a way of growing on you.
00:33:16.577,00:33:19.164,"See, this right here..."
00:33:19.247,00:33:20.415,in this office.
00:33:20.498,00:33:22.292,This is what's important.
00:33:22.375,00:33:28.506,"Knowing that the people I care about are safe, and having some sense of closure for the ones we've lost."
00:33:30.591,00:33:31.717,For Elena.
00:33:33.969,00:33:35.096,For Ben.
00:33:35.180,00:33:39.100,And everyone else that son of a bitch has hurt.
00:33:40.310,00:33:41.644,-Cheers. -Cheers.
00:33:52.697,00:33:55.700,I was thinking about a story from the Bible.
00:33:55.783,00:33:57.202,Did I tell you to open your mouth?
00:33:57.285,00:33:59.495,Let him talk. Don't mean nothin'.
00:34:00.663,00:34:03.541,I'm not a religious man...
00:34:03.624,00:34:06.586,but I've read bits and pieces over the years.
00:34:08.671,00:34:10.798,But this one story...
00:34:11.841,00:34:13.426,There was a man.
00:34:14.385,00:34:17.888,He was traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho...
00:34:19.099,00:34:22.102,when he was set upon by men of ill intent.
00:34:23.936,00:34:30.610,"They stripped the traveler of his clothes, they beat him, and they left him bleeding in the dirt."
00:34:33.571,00:34:35.656,And a priest happened by...
00:34:38.159,00:34:39.910,saw the traveler.
00:34:41.454,00:34:44.707,But he moved to the other side of the road and continued on.
00:34:44.790,00:34:47.710,"And then a Levite, a religious functionary, he..."
00:34:49.087,00:34:52.173,"came to the place, saw the dying traveler."
00:34:55.385,00:35:00.265,"But he too moved to the other side of the road, passed him by."
00:35:04.935,00:35:13.319,He saw the traveler bleeding in the road and he stopped to aid him without thinking of the circumstance or the difficulty it might bring him.
00:35:14.154,00:35:19.242,"The Samaritan tended to the traveler's wounds, applying oil and wine."
00:35:19.325,00:35:30.253,"And he carried him to an inn, gave him all the money he had for the owner to take care of the traveler, as the Samaritan, he..."
00:35:30.336,00:35:32.463,continued on his journey.
00:35:33.464,00:35:37.885,He did this simply because the traveler was his neighbor.
00:35:37.968,00:35:41.639,He loved his city and all the people in it.
00:35:56.028,00:35:57.447,"It's funny, isn't it?"
00:35:57.530,00:36:00.115,How even the best of men can be...
00:36:02.827,00:36:03.953,What the hell does that mean?
00:36:04.036,00:36:06.581,It means that I'm not the Samaritan.
00:36:13.671,00:36:15.673,That I am the ill intent...
00:36:17.383,00:36:22.305,who set upon the traveler on a road that he should not have been on.
00:37:05.806,00:37:08.183,Tac One! Tac One! Requesting sitrep! How copy?
00:37:20.363,00:37:25.743,What appears now to be some sort of firefight involving the FBI transport carrying Wilson Fisk.
00:37:25.826,00:37:27.828,"Uh, Janet, can you confirm what we're seeing here?"
00:37:30.456,00:37:36.546,"Jesus, we were idiots, weren't we? Sitting here, celebrating, thinking that it would be that easy with a man like him."
00:37:36.629,00:37:39.382,Let's get out of here before they close down the streets or something.
00:37:41.676,00:37:43.261,"No, no, where are you going? We're not leaving you."
00:37:43.344,00:37:45.305,"Back to my place, make some calls, see what I can find out."
00:37:45.388,00:37:46.847,-We'll drop you. -You live on the other side of town.
00:37:48.057,00:37:49.517,"Hang on, I'll get him a cab."
00:37:55.147,00:38:00.653,"-I won't be. -Matt-- I know I haven't earned it, not yet anyway, but I'm asking you to trust me, Foggy. I know what I'm doing."
00:38:02.322,00:38:04.239,All right.
00:38:05.575,00:38:09.036,"Go be a hero. Just don't get killed doing it, okay?"
00:38:10.288,00:38:11.414,Where you headed?
00:38:30.265,00:38:35.438,"I don't know who you assholes think you are, but if you don't back away, I swear to God, I'll put a bullet in this fat son of a bitch!"
00:38:38.649,00:38:39.984,"Let's get you out of here, sir."
00:38:45.948,00:38:47.575,Package acquired.
00:38:59.962,00:39:01.589,Go!
00:39:48.343,00:39:50.555,Black parts will give the most protection.
00:39:51.889,00:39:56.394,"Red might deflect a knife, depending on the angle..."
00:39:57.728,00:39:59.063,might not.
00:40:12.743,00:40:14.119,It'll do just fine.
00:40:18.916,00:40:20.334,Betsy?
00:40:24.088,00:40:26.298,I made you a promise.
00:40:26.381,00:40:27.758,I intend to keep it.
00:40:44.108,00:40:46.360,do not approach subject if sighted.
00:40:46.444,00:40:49.905,"Notify ESU forthwith. Repeat, do not approach."
00:41:40.330,00:41:41.832,Package is en route. I say again...
00:41:43.333,00:41:45.628,ETA 18 minutes. Prepare for extraction.
00:41:45.711,00:41:47.129,Copy that.
00:41:47.212,00:41:48.964,-Sir? -Thank you.
00:41:50.841,00:41:54.512,I know this has been a difficult chapter in our lives.
00:41:56.847,00:42:00.685,"Now, if I'm not there by your side in 20 minutes..."
00:42:00.768,00:42:02.269,I want you to leave.
00:42:02.352,00:42:04.855,"I'm not gonna let them take you away from me, Wilson."
00:42:04.939,00:42:06.816,If I'm not there by that time...
00:42:16.617,00:42:18.786,it's just an inconvenience.
00:42:18.869,00:42:21.831,Nothing will ever keep us apart.
00:42:34.635,00:43:12.006,"Fifteen minutes to the drop. Repeat, 15 minutes to the drop-- You were right..."
00:43:12.089,00:43:14.884,what you told me over the radio that night.
00:43:16.260,00:43:18.679,Not everyone deserves a happy ending.
00:43:24.518,00:43:25.645,You?
00:44:11.732,00:44:14.443,I wanted to make this city...
00:44:14.526,00:44:17.446,something better than it is.
00:44:20.365,00:44:22.451,You took that away from me!
00:44:23.869,00:44:25.746,You took everything!
00:44:27.206,00:44:29.166,I'm gonna kill you!
00:44:33.796,00:44:35.547,Take your shot.
00:46:08.849,00:46:12.686,This city doesn't deserve a better tomorrow.
00:46:12.769,00:46:15.272,It deserves to drown...
00:46:15.355,00:46:17.107,in its filth!
00:46:17.191,00:46:21.028,It deserves people like my father! People like you!
00:47:00.734,00:47:02.945,You really think that this will...
00:47:04.446,00:47:06.656,change anything?
00:47:10.410,00:47:12.829,You think one man in...
00:47:14.081,00:47:15.540,a silly little costume...
00:47:15.624,00:47:17.209,will...
00:47:17.292,00:47:18.919,will make a difference?
00:47:45.654,00:47:47.072,Police!
00:47:47.697,00:47:49.741,Show me your hands!
00:47:49.824,00:47:50.993,Do it!
00:47:55.164,00:47:56.790,"I told you before, Sergeant..."
00:47:57.749,00:47:59.418,I'm not the bad guy.
00:48:00.627,00:48:03.630,"Holy shit, it's you."
00:48:04.173,00:48:07.717,"This man was a fugitive from the law, and I stopped him."
00:48:13.807,00:48:15.350,Fifteen Sergeant Central.
00:48:15.434,00:48:21.941,"Be advised, Wilson Fisk under K, north alley four-six and ten."
00:49:43.688,00:49:45.024,"Thank you, Sergeant."
00:49:45.107,00:49:48.193,"Hey, so what am I supposed to call you when I file my report?"
00:49:55.534,00:49:56.743,That's what they're calling him now.
00:49:56.826,00:49:58.495,The man in the mask.
00:50:00.289,00:50:03.625,Sounds like he's gonna jump Snake River Canyon on his rocket cycle.
00:50:06.128,00:50:07.171,"Okay, okay."
00:50:07.254,00:50:09.881,"I thought it was a bit goofy at first, but it kinda grows on you."
00:50:09.964,00:50:12.384,And it's better than the Devil of Hell's Kitchen anyway.
00:50:12.467,00:50:14.261,Not wrong there.
00:50:16.305,00:50:20.016,that stopped that Union Allied nut from stabbing me in my apartment.
00:50:21.017,00:50:22.727,That is a serious upgrade.
00:50:22.811,00:50:24.979,"I don't know, I think the horns are a bit much."
00:50:25.897,00:50:27.732,There! Done!
00:50:28.858,00:50:29.943,What do you think?
00:50:30.026,00:50:31.528,I think I'm glad I fished it out of the trash.
00:50:31.611,00:50:32.862,Me too.
00:50:35.240,00:50:36.950,Nelson and Murdock.
00:50:41.080,00:50:42.331,Avocados?
00:50:42.914,00:50:44.416,It's a long story.
00:50:44.499,00:50:47.961,Which I do not have time to tell you.
00:50:48.044,00:50:52.424,Promised Marci I'd help her find a new job since most of the partners at Landman and Zack are under indictment.
00:50:52.507,00:50:54.301,Oh? You two getting back together?
00:50:54.384,00:50:56.010,No. I don't know.
00:50:56.095,00:50:57.137,Maybe.
00:50:59.389,00:51:01.933,"Well, thank her for us."
00:51:02.016,00:51:04.103,For everything she did helping bring Fisk down.
00:51:04.644,00:51:06.105,Fisk still needs to go to trial.
00:51:06.188,00:51:08.690,Just getting a court date on a case this big could take a year.
00:51:08.773,00:51:12.194,"-That long? -He's where he belongs, that's all that matters."
00:51:12.277,00:51:13.945,And we put him there.
00:51:14.028,00:51:16.323,"Yeah, we did."
00:51:16.406,00:51:17.574,Hell of a sign.
00:51:18.325,00:51:20.076,Now all we need are clients.
00:51:20.160,00:51:22.954,"One day at a time, partner. One day at a time."
00:51:26.416,00:51:28.168,Guess that means we should get back to work.
00:51:29.878,00:51:32.589,"-Hey, Karen. -Yeah."
00:51:35.842,00:51:38.553,There's been something in your voice.
00:51:43.642,00:51:46.311,"I thought whatever it was, whatever's been..."
00:51:47.103,00:51:50.857,"I thought it would get better once Fisk was put away, but..."
00:51:53.860,00:51:55.195,"it hasn't, has it?"
00:52:00.784,00:52:02.619,"We put him away, yeah..."
00:52:05.330,00:52:07.040,but it won't bring back Elena...
00:52:08.583,00:52:09.793,or Ben...
00:52:11.961,00:52:14.589,"or erase what we've been through, or..."
00:52:16.425,00:52:18.510,what we've had to do to get here.
00:52:18.593,00:52:20.136,Yeah.
00:52:22.472,00:52:25.267,A lot of decisions I'd give anything to go back and change.
00:52:27.101,00:52:28.562,But I can't.
00:52:29.813,00:52:31.356,None of us can.
00:52:32.982,00:52:36.528,"It's like I told Foggy, all we can do is move forward..."
00:52:38.572,00:52:40.532,together.
