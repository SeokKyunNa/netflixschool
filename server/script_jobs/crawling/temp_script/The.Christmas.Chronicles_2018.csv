00:31:23.296,00:31:24.755,Please leave us alone.
01:05:35.130,01:05:36.463,Start talking!
01:05:36.838,01:05:38.046,Where is Santa Claus?
01:05:43.838,01:05:44.963,You lost the reindeer?
01:05:46.130,01:05:47.171,Blitzen!
01:05:48.713,01:05:49.546,Cupid?
01:06:11.630,01:06:12.588,To the book!
01:06:21.630,01:06:22.630,Pierce.
01:06:44.130,01:06:46.546,She is a True Believer!
01:13:19.505,01:13:21.380,You're done! Naughty! Naughty!
01:13:55.421,01:13:57.255,Time to take out the trash.
01:13:58.463,01:13:59.338,Ready!
01:13:59.421,01:14:00.296,Aim!
01:14:00.380,01:14:01.421,Fire!
01:14:16.255,01:14:17.755,Wait. We missed one.
01:14:19.713,01:14:20.630,Get him!
01:14:44.463,01:14:46.463,I never have any fun.
01:14:59.963,01:15:01.755,Are you kidding?
01:15:10.213,01:15:11.421,It's not good.
01:18:02.796,01:18:03.921,Santa!
01:18:05.838,01:18:09.005,Mrs. Claus told you to take a spare.
01:18:09.130,01:18:10.713,"I know, I know."
01:19:13.880,01:19:15.463,"Looking good, Lars!"
01:19:16.046,01:19:17.880,"Thank you, Santa."
01:23:50.213,01:23:52.213,Slow down! Slow down!
01:26:01.255,01:26:03.963,Reporting for duty! -Reporting for duty!
01:26:46.880,01:26:50.796,Hunter and Connor Morris... They live on 4433 Pacific Avenue!
01:26:56.130,01:26:57.796,Welcome to the club!
01:27:35.296,01:27:37.796,"I told you, no food or drinks in the sleigh!"
01:27:38.505,01:27:40.421,"I can't help it, Santa."
01:27:40.505,01:27:42.338,I just love my candy canes.
01:37:02.838,01:37:05.046,Sounds like you had quite the night.
01:37:07.046,01:37:09.130,It was a bit more hectic than usual...
01:37:37.671,01:37:39.171,I knew it.
00:00:43.255,00:00:44.796,It's just like Daddy's.
00:00:45.005,00:00:46.796,Ted. Teddy!
00:00:46.880,00:00:48.588,"Look at the camera. Look and say, Hi, Mom."
00:00:50.088,00:00:51.838,"Well, look at her and say it."
00:01:06.255,00:01:08.755,"Look at this, huh! It's your sister."
00:01:08.838,00:01:10.421,Katie Cat!
00:01:11.005,00:01:14.005,"Katie Cat! That's good, dude. Gimme some."
00:01:14.713,00:01:18.005,Merry Christmas 2008! Santa got Teddy a bike!
00:01:18.088,00:01:19.796,Santa got Teddy a bike!
00:01:19.880,00:01:22.588,"-All right, wave to Mom. Say Hi, Mom. -Hi, Mom!"
00:01:22.671,00:01:24.088,"Say, Thank you, Santa."
00:01:26.255,00:01:29.338,It's Christmas 2011! Whoo! What did we get?
00:01:31.338,00:01:34.005,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What are you doing, you guys?"
00:01:34.088,00:01:35.046,Come on!
00:01:35.296,00:01:37.713,All right? What-- What do we do? We...
00:01:41.838,00:01:46.171,"Okay, so most people don't know this, but reindeer love candy canes. Watch."
00:02:05.088,00:02:07.963,Teddy is about to open his present from Daddy.
00:02:17.421,00:02:20.755,-A Pierce always sees it through. -That's right.
00:02:22.463,00:02:25.505,"-Everyone get together. -A picture. All right, guys."
00:03:12.630,00:03:14.963,"Eighteen Bridgton Road, Lowell, Massachusetts."
00:03:15.213,00:03:17.713,Just wanted to say that I've been really good this year.
00:03:17.796,00:03:22.921,"I know I haven't been doing too well in school, especially since I got a D minus in Spanish."
00:03:23.213,00:03:25.046,I have a really hard time with languages.
00:03:25.130,00:03:27.338,But I promise to get my grades up in the new year.
00:03:27.588,00:03:28.796,I help out Mom a lot.
00:03:29.005,00:03:35.171,"She has to work at the hospital most nights, so I start dinner three, four times a week, do the dishes, and take out the trash."
00:03:35.546,00:03:37.755,And I try not to get into too much trouble.
00:03:37.880,00:03:44.380,"I do say bad words every now and then, but that's only when my brother, Teddy, makes fun of me and I lose my sh-- I mean, my temper."
00:03:44.755,00:03:47.671,"Anyway, Santa, I'm not asking for much this Christmas."
00:03:47.755,00:03:49.713,Just a Bones Brigade skateboard.
00:03:49.796,00:03:52.046,"You know, the red one with the skeleton on it?"
00:03:52.213,00:03:54.338,"My brother, Teddy, won't even let me touch his."
00:03:59.546,00:04:00.713,He doesn't deserve anything.
00:04:00.796,00:04:04.255,"He's turning into a real loser-- Ow! Teddy, what the hell?"
00:04:04.338,00:04:05.713,"Oh, sorry! I meant heck."
00:04:08.171,00:04:10.046,Who cares? This camera's like 20 years old.
00:04:10.130,00:04:11.963,"If it's good enough for Dad, it's good enough for me."
00:04:12.046,00:04:13.505,"Now, give it back!"
00:04:13.588,00:04:16.421,I can't believe you're still making video letters to Santa.
00:04:16.505,00:04:17.505,Why?
00:04:17.588,00:04:19.921,-You're ten years old! Almost 11! -So?
00:04:22.713,00:04:24.546,What are you talking about?
00:04:29.005,00:04:31.088,There is no...
00:04:32.171,00:04:33.213,No what?
00:04:37.963,00:04:38.838,No...
00:04:39.713,00:04:42.463,chance that he's gonna watch a video.
00:04:43.005,00:04:45.671,He only reads handwritten letters sent in the mail.
00:04:46.046,00:04:47.463,Where are you going?
00:04:47.963,00:04:49.088,I gotta meet my friends.
00:04:49.588,00:04:50.921,Then I'm coming with.
00:04:55.005,00:04:56.046,I'm coming with you.
00:05:01.713,00:05:03.880,-My fish! -Hope they're hungry.
00:05:05.005,00:05:07.213,"Don't worry, guys! Everything's gonna be okay!"
00:06:17.088,00:06:19.546,No freaking way.
00:06:31.421,00:06:33.380,You have a good time with your friends?
00:06:33.630,00:06:35.588,Get outta my room. You're not allowed in here.
00:06:35.880,00:06:38.880,And you're not allowed to steal cars from the deli parking lot.
00:06:41.796,00:06:44.255,-I didn't steal a car. -I saw the whole thing.
00:06:45.880,00:06:46.755,Can't prove it.
00:06:47.671,00:06:48.796,Wanna bet?
00:06:50.296,00:06:51.171,Give me that.
00:06:51.755,00:06:54.630,"When Mom sees this, she's gonna freak out!"
00:06:54.713,00:06:57.630,"She's so sick of your crap, I bet she turns you in to the cops herself!"
00:06:57.713,00:06:59.380,"Gimme that tape, you little creep!"
00:06:59.963,00:07:01.380,"Oh, you're so dead!"
00:07:21.088,00:07:23.213,Is this what happens when I leave?
00:07:23.296,00:07:24.588,-She started it. -Did not!
00:07:27.713,00:07:28.713,"Oh, jeez..."
00:07:29.671,00:07:30.671,What did he do now?
00:07:34.255,00:07:35.630,"Come on, Kate! I'm waiting!"
00:07:36.421,00:07:38.380,What did Teddy do?
00:07:41.588,00:07:44.255,"He shoved me against the wall, into this picture."
00:08:01.213,00:08:03.171,I want for the two of you to get along.
00:08:04.213,00:08:06.671,You're her older brother. I expect more from you.
00:08:08.130,00:08:10.088,"Teddy, please put the tree back up."
00:08:10.755,00:08:13.755,"And put the lights on, while you're at it. I've only been asking you all week!"
00:08:13.838,00:08:25.338,"Come on, you guys! Dad would've had this place looking-- Kate, help me unload the groceries."
00:08:55.588,00:08:57.671,I think it looks great.
00:08:57.963,00:09:01.838,"Whoa, whoa! You want some cookie with those sprinkles? Golly!"
00:09:01.921,00:09:03.338,Dad likes sprinkles.
00:09:10.505,00:09:12.463,"-I don't mean to. -That's okay, honey."
00:09:16.130,00:09:18.546,-Thanks. -I think they should all be like that.
00:09:22.380,00:09:23.338,Seriously?
00:09:27.505,00:09:29.213,"Oh, no. That's terrible."
00:09:30.421,00:09:32.921,"Yeah, no, of course. I'll-- I'll be right there."
00:09:35.755,00:09:37.130,You gotta work tonight?
00:09:41.630,00:09:44.046,"Well, even more reason for me to be at the hospital, honey."
00:09:44.130,00:09:46.338,Some people have no one else to take care of them.
00:09:46.421,00:09:48.380,But there's still so much to do.
00:09:48.463,00:09:50.671,We have to hang the stockings and make the eggnog!
00:09:53.171,00:09:56.880,There is more to Christmas than all that stuff.
00:09:57.255,00:09:59.505,"I'm gonna pretend like I didn't hear that, Mom."
00:10:02.505,00:10:05.338,-Hey! Where are you going? -Just out.
00:10:10.421,00:10:14.130,"You haven't been caroling since you were in kindergarten, and you hated it."
00:10:14.213,00:10:16.338,Just wanna spread a little Christmas cheer.
00:10:16.630,00:10:18.171,More like Christmas beer.
00:10:19.671,00:10:22.380,"Okay, well, you can't go, 'cause I need to work."
00:10:23.380,00:10:24.796,-Yeah. -It's Christmas Eve.
00:10:24.880,00:10:27.588,Which is why you're gonna stay home with your sister.
00:10:29.713,00:10:31.588,"You are not to leave this house, young man!"
00:10:31.671,00:10:33.880,"You leave her alone again, and you are grounded!"
00:10:33.963,00:10:35.255,Until February.
00:10:35.755,00:10:37.213,You wanna spread some cheer?
00:10:37.296,00:10:38.213,Decorate the tree.
00:10:39.130,00:10:40.046,Whatever.
00:10:44.213,00:10:46.338,"Take the cookies out in 20 minutes, all right?"
00:10:49.963,00:10:52.963,"And listen, absolutely no junk food, okay?"
00:10:57.671,00:10:59.963,"See you guys tomorrow, bright and early."
00:11:01.630,00:11:02.796,I love you.
00:11:05.838,00:11:06.880,Merry Christmas.
00:11:15.130,00:11:19.255,"Wanna watch a movie? Mom's gone, so it can be PG-13 or maybe even R!"
00:11:20.255,00:11:22.713,-I'm gonna go to my room. -But it's Christmas Eve!
00:11:22.796,00:11:24.380,Let's do something together.
00:11:24.463,00:11:25.463,"Come on, Teddy Bear."
00:11:26.838,00:11:28.630,I told you to stop calling me that.
00:11:29.421,00:11:33.171,"You used to laugh when I called you Teddy Bear, and I was your Katie Cat."
00:11:33.796,00:11:35.713,But ever since Dad died...
00:11:35.921,00:11:36.838,I mean...
00:11:37.296,00:11:40.213,all you wanna do is hang out with your wannabe gangster friends.
00:11:42.588,00:11:45.255,You know... at least they're fun.
00:11:46.338,00:11:48.255,They're not boring slugs like you.
00:12:04.963,00:12:11.171,And-- This looks like mistletoe.
00:12:14.213,00:12:15.796,-I love you. -I love you.
00:12:15.880,00:12:17.005,Say Merry Christmas.
00:12:59.505,00:13:01.838,"Teddy, get down here! You've gotta see this!"
00:13:01.921,00:13:03.630,You're not gonna believe it!
00:13:08.630,00:13:11.921,No way. That person isn't wearing an ugly Christmas sweater.
00:13:12.005,00:13:19.588,"And besides, Aunt Peggy's never here on Christmas Eve. And if she was, why would Mom and Dad leave her alone in the living room in the dark?"
00:13:19.671,00:13:20.671,Maybe it was a burglar.
00:13:20.921,00:13:22.630,Burglars take things.
00:13:23.255,00:13:30.880,"Whoever it was would've had to been standing flat up against the wall like this, next to the-- Oh, my gosh! The fireplace! I just got goosebumps!"
00:13:31.713,00:13:32.671,Chill out.
00:13:33.463,00:13:34.546,Just let me think.
00:13:34.630,00:13:36.838,"-Come on, Teddy. You know it's him. -Kate..."
00:13:37.463,00:13:38.838,"Hey, we should make a video!"
00:13:41.630,00:13:42.463,Tonight!
00:13:42.546,00:13:46.338,"Maybe we can get a shot of the whole Santa Claus, and not just his hand!"
00:13:46.796,00:13:48.755,You don't think anyone's thought of that before?
00:13:48.838,00:13:50.380,Catching Santa in the act?
00:13:53.296,00:13:56.546,"Yeah, but have you ever heard of anyone actually pulling it off?"
00:13:56.630,00:13:59.546,No! They probably don't think it's possible. But it is!
00:14:00.880,00:14:04.546,A video showing exactly how he does it. It's gonna get a gazillion hits.
00:14:04.630,00:14:05.630,No way.
00:14:05.713,00:14:08.338,Please? Mom always says we should be helping each other out.
00:14:08.421,00:14:10.046,I don't think this is what she had in mind.
00:14:10.130,00:14:12.505,Look! I'll give you back the tape of you in the car.
00:14:16.755,00:14:19.046,Okay. Deal.
00:14:20.380,00:14:22.588,And you can never say anything to Mom about it.
00:14:28.255,00:14:29.463,I swear.
00:14:58.755,00:14:59.755,What are you doing?
00:15:00.255,00:15:02.255,I saw it on Ghost Adventurers.
00:15:03.963,00:15:05.505,Lamest Christmas ever.
00:15:21.630,00:15:24.755,"-Hey! Mom said no junk food! -Yeah, well, we gotta stay up somehow."
00:15:25.713,00:15:26.713,Plus...
00:15:27.588,00:15:30.505,"sometimes, you gotta break the rules for the greater good."
00:15:32.630,00:15:35.630,"Can't even remember the last time we did anything together, Teddy."
00:15:35.713,00:15:38.380,Just the two of us! Pulling an all-nighter!
00:15:39.088,00:15:40.546,How awesome is this?
00:15:42.713,00:15:43.630,Whatever.
00:15:46.546,00:15:48.463,So good. So good.
00:16:43.046,00:16:45.213,Teddy! Teddy! Teddy!
00:16:51.171,00:16:52.338,He's gone!
00:17:02.380,00:17:04.463,-He's at the back of the house! -Get your coat!
00:17:12.046,00:17:13.755,Whoa! Gimme the camera!
00:17:21.505,00:17:23.463,We'll get a better view from the alley!
00:17:43.796,00:17:45.421,Tell me you're getting this.
00:17:45.713,00:17:47.130,"Oh, yeah, right."
00:18:11.338,00:18:12.171,"Kate, wait!"
00:18:15.546,00:18:16.546,Come back!
00:18:17.630,00:18:18.463,What are you doing?
00:18:18.546,00:18:21.880,Do you realize how big of a deal this is? I need to get a closer look.
00:18:21.963,00:18:24.671,-Get down. -No way. Hand me the camera.
00:18:30.255,00:18:33.130,"Be careful. You break your neck, and Mom will kill me."
00:18:44.380,00:18:46.130,Kate... what are you...
00:18:46.463,00:18:47.463,"No, stop!"
00:18:59.963,00:19:02.088,-Teddy! -Are you crazy?
00:19:06.963,00:19:07.796,Why'd you do that?
00:19:07.880,00:19:09.755,I wanted to get a closer look at the sleigh.
00:19:14.296,00:19:15.296,Duck!
00:19:19.755,00:19:21.713,-Did he see us? -I don't think so.
00:19:21.796,00:19:23.546,We got enough footage. Let's get outta here.
00:19:23.630,00:19:26.005,-Why don't we just stay here? -Stay here? In the sleigh?
00:19:26.088,00:19:29.880,Yeah! How many kids get to ride with Santa in his sleigh on Christmas Eve?
00:19:50.088,00:19:51.921,"On, Cupid! On, Comet!"
00:20:33.171,00:20:35.421,Maybe Santa has a blanket?
00:20:35.505,00:20:36.630,I'll look.
00:20:57.255,00:20:58.588,"Help me, Teddy!"
00:21:01.255,00:21:02.713,Kate! Help!
00:21:03.380,00:21:04.213,Who?
00:21:18.338,00:21:20.463,-Reach! -I'm trying!
00:21:20.963,00:21:22.380,Teddy!
00:21:58.630,00:21:59.838,Whoa.
00:22:23.880,00:22:25.463,Hold on to your sister!
00:22:40.046,00:22:41.130,Brace yourselves!
00:23:03.796,00:23:04.755,Teddy?
00:23:12.463,00:23:14.005,Where's the camera?
00:23:22.380,00:23:23.630,Where are we?
00:23:25.421,00:23:27.713,-Teddy... -I could have swore I saw Paris!
00:23:27.921,00:23:30.796,"-Uh, Teddy? -That plane almost killed us!"
00:23:38.755,00:23:39.921,Santa Claus?
00:23:41.630,00:23:43.046,Live and in person.
00:23:43.630,00:23:44.671,One night only.
00:23:45.796,00:23:47.088,You two okay?
00:23:47.505,00:23:48.463,Yeah.
00:23:49.005,00:23:51.880,"You look so... um, different."
00:23:52.088,00:23:54.171,Why? Because I'm not a big fat slob?
00:23:54.463,00:23:56.338,"No, no. I-- I didn't mean it that way."
00:23:56.588,00:23:58.880,"Ah, that's okay, Kate. I guess it's understandable."
00:23:58.963,00:24:02.088,"I mean, who can eat millions of cookies in one night and not get fat, right?"
00:24:04.380,00:24:06.005,"Can you go, Ho ho ho?"
00:24:06.421,00:24:09.005,"I don't go, Ho ho ho. That's a myth."
00:24:09.338,00:24:10.546,Fake news.
00:24:11.255,00:24:12.171,Sorry.
00:24:16.421,00:24:19.421,You two have really messed things up.
00:24:19.505,00:24:21.088,You were supposed to be asleep.
00:24:21.505,00:24:23.005,-It was all her idea! -Hey!
00:24:25.421,00:24:27.046,What did you do with my sack of presents?
00:24:27.713,00:24:29.296,It flew off the sleigh.
00:24:29.838,00:24:30.921,"Oh, not good."
00:24:31.921,00:24:33.380,Not good at all.
00:24:40.338,00:24:41.796,First star's there...
00:24:42.380,00:24:44.046,Second star's there.
00:24:45.046,00:24:47.213,We came back over Moscow and...
00:24:47.921,00:24:53.046,"and over Paris, New York, Boston... Oh!"
00:24:53.630,00:24:56.546,Reindeer must've broken off somewhere over Lakeshore Drive.
00:24:56.755,00:24:58.255,Lakeshore Drive?
00:24:58.338,00:25:00.130,"We're in Chicago, young lady."
00:25:00.213,00:25:01.130,Chicago?
00:25:01.213,00:25:03.921,"That means we traveled thousands of miles in, like, 30 seconds."
00:25:08.546,00:25:14.671,"If I'm not up and running in the next couple of hours, half the continent's not gonna get presents, and that, well, that can never happen."
00:25:15.088,00:25:18.171,"Uh, so a few brats don't get presents. It's not the end of the world."
00:25:21.213,00:25:26.171,That's just the kinda lame garbage I'd expect from a Lost Believer.
00:25:27.130,00:25:28.921,"You listen to me, Teddy Pierce."
00:25:30.005,00:25:37.796,"Tonight, young boys and girls all over the globe are waiting, hoping, expecting Santa Claus to arrive."
00:25:38.255,00:25:39.296,And if I don't...
00:25:39.630,00:25:44.546,"Well, you don't wanna know what happened the last time I couldn't make my rounds."
00:25:44.796,00:25:46.630,"Yes, we do. Tell us."
00:25:48.796,00:25:50.630,You've heard of the Dark Ages?
00:25:51.713,00:25:53.963,Read about all those wars in school?
00:25:54.380,00:25:55.713,"Yeah, sure, but..."
00:25:57.046,00:25:59.130,"Wait, those happened because you missed Christmas?"
00:25:59.380,00:26:03.005,Christmas spirit is more powerful than you could ever imagine.
00:26:03.630,00:26:07.046,People need Christmas to remind themselves of how good they can be!
00:26:07.505,00:26:10.796,"Without it, well, Christmas simply..."
00:26:11.671,00:26:13.046,must endure!
00:26:13.255,00:26:30.213,"All right, I need to round up the reindeer, find my sack of presents, call the elves, and maybe, What is that?"
00:26:31.880,00:26:33.546,Tracking device for the sack.
00:26:34.796,00:26:37.130,"The closer you get, the faster it chimes."
00:26:38.421,00:26:40.588,"-It's pretty cool. -Yeah, it is."
00:26:45.296,00:26:46.171,Uh...
00:26:51.713,00:26:52.588,bye.
00:26:56.255,00:26:57.546,"Santa, are you okay?"
00:26:59.963,00:27:01.588,"Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no!"
00:27:01.796,00:27:02.630,My hat!
00:27:03.296,00:27:04.130,My hat's gone!
00:27:04.213,00:27:05.296,Do you want mine?
00:27:05.380,00:27:08.046,"Oh, that-- that won't help. Your hat's not magic."
00:27:08.630,00:27:09.546,Magic?
00:27:09.630,00:27:13.838,"Well, how do you think I can turn into coal dust and leap from rooftop to rooftop?"
00:27:14.380,00:27:15.421,Pilates?
00:27:16.255,00:27:17.213,My hat!
00:27:21.713,00:27:23.713,"You should always bring a spare, Nick!"
00:27:26.671,00:27:27.755,Well...
00:27:27.838,00:27:30.796,I guess I'm gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way.
00:27:31.671,00:27:32.880,On foot.
00:27:32.963,00:27:34.338,"Santa, just let us help you!"
00:27:34.421,00:27:35.338,"Oh, no, no, no."
00:27:35.421,00:27:38.421,"I think you've done quite enough damage already, don't you?"
00:27:38.671,00:27:41.546,"No, you just go on back to your house and get some sleep."
00:27:41.630,00:27:43.171,No need to wake up early.
00:27:43.338,00:27:45.296,There won't be any presents.
00:27:55.421,00:27:57.630,We can't just stay here! Santa needs us!
00:27:57.963,00:27:59.546,I don't know. He seems pretty mad.
00:28:01.213,00:28:03.046,"We're, like, a thousand miles away!"
00:28:03.505,00:28:06.463,"Teddy, you heard him. We're on the naughty list for life!"
00:28:07.171,00:28:08.671,We've ruined Christmas!
00:28:08.755,00:28:11.963,"I mean, that's, like, the worst possible thing a kid could ever do!"
00:28:12.046,00:28:14.421,Do you really wanna tell your kids that you were that guy?
00:28:14.505,00:28:18.463,The person responsible for the Christmas Meltdown of 2018?
00:28:24.588,00:28:26.005,We just wanna help!
00:28:26.255,00:28:28.380,"Ah, well, I can't do anything to stop you."
00:28:29.130,00:28:33.338,"You better watch out, you better not pout, and you better not cry."
00:28:34.630,00:28:37.171,I don't have time for any more of your shenanigans.
00:28:43.005,00:28:44.088,"Ah, perfect."
00:28:54.755,00:28:58.046,"Uh, I don't think I'm supposed to be in here."
00:28:58.130,00:29:00.380,"Just stay next to me, but I'll do the talking."
00:29:02.963,00:29:04.046,Can I help you?
00:29:04.755,00:29:05.796,Wendy!
00:29:09.421,00:29:10.296,Excuse me?
00:29:10.838,00:29:12.963,"Ah, you know what I mean. Grown-up big!"
00:29:13.255,00:29:17.046,"Now, do you remember that letter you sent me about dreaming of being a fashion designer?"
00:29:17.755,00:29:20.838,"She used to always ask for sewing kits, little toy sewing machines."
00:29:20.921,00:29:25.130,I think it was 2009 when you made all the stockings by yourself.
00:29:26.505,00:29:28.088,"Yeah, I think so."
00:29:28.171,00:29:31.546,"Well, I'm sorry the fashion designer thing didn't quite pan out."
00:29:32.046,00:29:36.463,"Yeah, I wanted to go to Parsons and live in New York, but I couldn't afford the tuition."
00:29:36.880,00:29:37.838,Hmm...
00:29:39.755,00:29:42.338,Is this some kind of reality show? How do you know all that stuff?
00:29:43.630,00:29:44.880,Did you talk to my mom?
00:29:45.171,00:29:49.671,"Oh, no, no, no. I certainly wouldn't ruin the surprise of that beautiful scarf you made for your mom."
00:29:52.796,00:29:54.463,We need a ride into the city.
00:29:54.546,00:29:57.171,"Oh, I don't have a car. Can you call an Uber?"
00:29:57.421,00:29:58.630,Don't have an account.
00:29:58.880,00:30:00.255,"Um, a taxi?"
00:30:00.505,00:30:02.130,"Oh, you guys got any cash on you?"
00:30:03.380,00:30:04.255,"Ah, right."
00:30:05.505,00:30:07.963,You think I can pay the driver... with these?
00:30:11.588,00:30:14.005,"You know what? Um... Here, take my tips."
00:30:14.088,00:30:19.755,"Um, although I don't think it's enough to cover -a cab ride-- -That's very kind of you, but I'm sure somebody in here will help us out."
00:30:24.880,00:30:26.963,"Uh, sorry for the intrusion, folks."
00:30:28.255,00:30:29.963,-I'm-- -Santa Claus.
00:30:30.046,00:30:32.338,"-The real Santa Claus! -Yeah, that's okay, Kate."
00:30:32.421,00:30:35.255,-Not just one of those phony mall ones. -I've got this.
00:30:35.338,00:30:37.171,You don't look like Santa Claus.
00:30:41.713,00:30:45.255,"Yeah, well, billboards add 80 pounds, Freddie."
00:30:46.130,00:30:50.671,"As I was saying, we've got ourselves an emergency situation here."
00:30:50.755,00:30:52.755,Christmas is in trouble.
00:30:53.213,00:30:58.630,"And if you all want presents under the tree and in your stockings in the morning, then I need your help."
00:30:59.421,00:31:00.338,So...
00:31:00.505,00:31:03.921,who here can give us a ride into the city so I can find my reindeer?
00:31:09.213,00:31:10.880,"Uh, Min-Jun."
00:31:15.296,00:31:17.213,"I'm sorry, we can't help."
00:31:25.005,00:31:25.880,Hmm.
00:31:35.046,00:31:36.046,Well...
00:31:36.630,00:31:39.046,"Hey, Larry! Sheila."
00:31:39.338,00:31:41.880,"Larry, you drove your Porsche here tonight, didn't you?"
00:31:42.255,00:31:48.130,-Yeah. -How would you like to trade that Porsche for a mint condition 1952...
00:31:50.921,00:31:53.213,I know you've always wanted one.
00:31:53.921,00:31:56.088,"-Is this thing real? -Oh, yes."
00:31:57.130,00:31:59.088,-It's a deal. It's a deal. -I thought so.
00:31:59.421,00:32:01.255,"-It's at the valet. -No, it's not!"
00:32:01.338,00:32:04.713,"You're not trading our Porsche for a baseball card, Larry!"
00:32:04.796,00:32:06.963,-Know what that is worth? -What it's worth? Nothing!
00:32:09.213,00:32:10.463,"Get outta here, you bum!"
00:32:12.088,00:32:16.796,There is a maniac dressed in a weird Santa costume harassing the customers.
00:32:17.380,00:32:20.380,He's got two kids with him. It could be an AMBER Alert situation.
00:32:22.463,00:32:24.546,"-you've had a hard time believ-- -Okay, sorry, folks!"
00:32:24.630,00:32:26.546,-Grandpa's a little... -What are you doing?
00:32:26.630,00:32:28.671,"-What has gotten into you? -Okay, Santa, let's go!"
00:32:35.171,00:32:37.380,if it isn't Charlie Plummer!
00:32:38.005,00:32:40.755,"Now, old Charlie here is in the Naughty List Hall of Fame!"
00:32:41.255,00:32:44.130,"Ah, you just got outta the joint again, what, about a month ago, Charlie?"
00:32:45.755,00:32:47.171,Armed robbery...
00:32:47.255,00:32:49.380,"money laundering, grand theft auto."
00:32:49.588,00:32:50.671,"You know what, Charlie?"
00:32:51.505,00:32:57.380,"I don't think your parole officer would be too happy if he knew you'd stolen that red Dodge Challenger a couple of days ago, do you?"
00:32:57.796,00:33:01.213,"Yeah, well, what my parole officer doesn't know won't hurt him."
00:33:01.838,00:33:04.838,"You, on the other hand, might not be so lucky!"
00:33:04.921,00:33:06.130,No judgments!
00:33:06.213,00:33:09.046,"After all, my friend Teddy here is headed down the same path."
00:33:09.130,00:33:10.713,"I mean, he's still a little young, but..."
00:33:11.046,00:33:12.963,"you keep going, couple years, this could be you."
00:33:13.505,00:33:16.171,Prison tattoos and slinging tequila shots!
00:33:16.255,00:33:18.630,"-Okay, that's it! -All right, out! Out, out, out, out!"
00:33:18.713,00:33:19.963,"Bye, Wendy!"
00:33:21.255,00:33:22.505,"Let's go! Okay, hold the doors!"
00:33:29.130,00:33:30.046,Be careful.
00:33:35.713,00:33:39.380,Oh no! Christmas spirit's already down 35%.
00:33:39.463,00:33:41.630,We need to get things back on track.
00:33:41.713,00:33:42.880,-Hold on. -What?
00:33:43.838,00:33:44.838,Shh.
00:33:50.130,00:33:51.880,She's our friend and she's crazy!
00:33:52.255,00:33:57.046,"If you come back here, she'll kill you! You hear me? She'll kill you..."
00:34:00.380,00:34:01.255,Ah...
00:34:01.838,00:34:04.963,"No, no, no, no. Teddy, Teddy, I don't think this is such a good idea."
00:34:05.046,00:34:06.255,Neither do I.
00:34:06.755,00:34:08.421,"Oh, come on! Do you wanna save Christmas?"
00:34:08.505,00:34:10.005,"Well, not by stealing a car."
00:34:10.171,00:34:13.421,"Uh, that kinda undermines the whole naughty or nice concept, don't you think?"
00:34:13.505,00:34:15.588,"Don't you break into, like, a billion homes every year?"
00:34:15.671,00:34:19.296,"-I mean, technically, that's illegal, too. -Fair point."
00:34:19.380,00:34:21.546,"And, plus, it's not just any car."
00:34:21.838,00:34:22.921,It's this car.
00:34:24.838,00:34:25.838,Oh...
00:34:26.755,00:34:29.130,"I mean, we're not even breaking the law because..."
00:34:29.213,00:34:30.963,"you know, the car's already stolen."
00:34:31.046,00:34:33.880,"-And when we're finished, we'll just-- -Turn it in to the police."
00:34:33.963,00:34:35.630,-Yeah. -Let's go.
00:34:36.421,00:34:40.421,"All right, now, slow down. Just be cool. Walk regular. Regular."
00:34:40.505,00:34:42.130,"Hey, hey, slow down! Slow down!"
00:34:42.213,00:34:44.213,You're not even old enough to drive!
00:34:45.463,00:34:47.463,"-Hey! -Oh, no time to argue! Look!"
00:34:47.546,00:34:48.838,That's my car!
00:34:49.713,00:34:51.963,"-No, it's not! You stole it! -Get in, get in!"
00:34:57.588,00:34:59.088,That's my car!
00:35:03.588,00:35:06.880,"Hey, don't worry, Charlie. I just reported it stolen."
00:35:07.380,00:35:08.796,You did what?
00:35:18.713,00:35:19.546,How we doing?
00:35:19.630,00:35:21.338,"No one's following us, so you can slow down."
00:35:21.421,00:35:23.088,"Oh, come on, I'm not even going that fast!"
00:35:26.880,00:35:29.213,"All right, now we're getting somewhere."
00:35:29.546,00:35:31.796,"Uh, Santa, you know that stuff's junk, right?"
00:35:32.921,00:35:35.796,"Yeah, well, Katie Cat, one man's junk..."
00:35:36.505,00:35:37.880,is Santa's treasure.
00:35:38.505,00:35:39.963,"Teddy, I'm gonna need your knife."
00:35:51.630,00:35:53.880,"Uh, Santa, that's not how you work the radio."
00:35:58.671,00:36:02.046,on the corner of Naperville and Roslyn. Car 476 responding.
00:36:02.796,00:36:06.088,-How did you just-- -I am the greatest toymaker on Earth.
00:36:09.130,00:36:14.588,"A 2014 red Dodge Challenger, license plate six, Bravo, Lima, seven, two, four."
00:36:14.671,00:36:17.130,Stolen by two kids and an extremely large man.
00:36:19.838,00:36:23.463,"stays away from sugar and carbs, what difference does it make? Oh man."
00:36:25.380,00:36:26.713,of what appear to be...
00:36:26.963,00:36:28.963,reindeer... running down Michigan Avenue...
00:36:31.088,00:36:35.255,"I have a team of reindeer headed southbound on Michigan Avenue, toward Water Tower."
00:36:35.338,00:36:37.005,They're not that far away.
00:36:37.088,00:36:40.171,"-That way! Go! -The, uh... The car can't fly, Santa."
00:36:40.713,00:36:45.255,"Right, habit. Okay, left on State, right on Erie, left on Michigan."
00:36:45.338,00:36:47.046,How do you know so much about Chicago?
00:36:47.130,00:36:48.838,"I know every street in the world, kid."
00:36:48.921,00:36:50.838,"Teddy, you think we could pick it up a little bit?"
00:36:52.088,00:36:53.171,Put your seat belt on.
00:36:57.213,00:36:58.505,"State Street, go!"
00:37:05.296,00:37:06.796,"Good move, Teddy."
00:37:21.671,00:37:22.796,All right.
00:37:23.546,00:37:25.130,"Slow down, Teddy."
00:37:25.921,00:37:28.088,See if we can find my reindeer.
00:37:36.213,00:37:37.213,Donner!
00:37:38.005,00:37:38.880,Comet!
00:37:49.171,00:37:50.005,Where?
00:37:50.088,00:37:53.005,"Back down that street! Turn around, Teddy! Turn around!"
00:38:02.630,00:38:03.671,"Teddy, stop the car!"
00:38:06.380,00:38:09.255,Prancer! Dancer! Get back here!
00:38:09.338,00:38:11.546,Comet! Cupid! Donner!
00:38:14.546,00:38:15.963,Guys! Guys!
00:38:18.588,00:38:20.005,"All right. Kate, come here."
00:38:20.296,00:38:21.255,Yeah?
00:38:21.713,00:38:23.380,You go after the reindeer.
00:38:23.463,00:38:25.630,-Teddy and I are gonna buy you some time. -What?
00:38:25.713,00:38:27.380,We can't leave my sister all alone out here.
00:38:27.463,00:38:28.671,"Teddy, I can handle it."
00:38:33.963,00:38:35.796,"I've always believed in you, Kate."
00:38:36.796,00:38:38.171,I've always believed in you.
00:38:39.713,00:38:41.255,Unlike some people.
00:38:42.046,00:38:43.546,"Guys, we better move."
00:38:44.796,00:38:47.755,You can do this. Go get 'em.
00:39:00.796,00:39:02.421,"Come on, quick! Here we go!"
00:39:03.880,00:39:05.505,"-Hey! -Get outta the car, man!"
00:39:05.588,00:39:06.796,"Yeah, yeah, I got it."
00:39:24.838,00:39:26.130,All right!
00:39:26.213,00:39:31.088,"I mean, I'm used to something with more pop under the hood, but, man, this baby really handles!"
00:39:31.171,00:39:34.046,"I mean, can't you just wave your hand and Jedi mind trick the cops?"
00:39:43.213,00:39:44.505,Reindeer!
00:39:45.755,00:39:46.630,Comet!
00:39:51.546,00:39:52.796,Where are you?
00:40:01.046,00:40:02.796,"Shh, it's okay. It's okay."
00:40:04.255,00:40:06.046,I won't hurt you. I'm with Santa.
00:40:23.213,00:40:24.171,It's okay.
00:40:24.630,00:40:26.088,I'm one of the good guys.
00:40:38.005,00:40:39.338,You can trust me.
00:40:44.296,00:40:46.630,There you go. It's okay.
00:40:47.380,00:40:48.296,It's okay.
00:40:54.213,00:40:56.296,"I'm Kate, and you're..."
00:40:57.421,00:40:58.255,Comet.
00:40:58.546,00:41:00.796,Comet? The Comet?
00:41:01.088,00:41:03.296,"Wow, you're really famous where I come from!"
00:41:03.380,00:41:05.338,Santa's really worried about you.
00:41:05.421,00:41:07.255,Is it okay if I take you to him?
00:41:17.213,00:41:18.130,Whoa!
00:41:33.963,00:41:35.421,"for one night, don't you think?"
00:41:54.755,00:41:55.796,Hang on!
00:42:19.921,00:42:22.713,If you ever meet Mrs. Claus...
00:42:26.463,00:42:27.880,...skip this part.
00:42:39.630,00:42:41.338,-Step out of the car! -You gotta be kidding.
00:42:45.255,00:42:48.338,-Get out of the car! -You heard the man! Get out! Now!
00:42:49.255,00:42:51.713,Dave? Little Mikey!
00:42:54.588,00:43:01.046,"Now, they were always good kids. Well, almost-- Yeah, the car's stolen, but we didn't steal it."
00:43:01.130,00:43:03.796,We were just borrowing it before bringing it back to the station.
00:43:03.880,00:43:06.255,"That's the first time I heard that one. How about you, Dave?"
00:43:06.338,00:43:07.838,This job's always full of surprises.
00:43:07.921,00:43:11.255,"I'm not joking! We're gonna return the car, good as new!"
00:43:11.338,00:43:12.755,Yeah? How you plan on doing that?
00:43:13.921,00:43:15.463,My crew of elves.
00:43:16.671,00:43:19.463,Elves? Right. They're good with bodywork?
00:43:22.130,00:43:25.255,They build thousands of cars every year.
00:43:25.713,00:43:27.421,Oh yeah? They work in Detroit?
00:43:28.588,00:43:29.796,Little further north.
00:43:30.171,00:43:31.505,"Oh, he's serious."
00:43:36.463,00:43:40.296,"Come on, fellas. Really? I-- Claus. Santa."
00:43:40.755,00:43:46.963,"Right, right. Why don't you give us a Ho ho ho -so we really know it's you? -I don't do Ho ho ho."
00:43:49.630,00:43:51.921,Tell us what you're doing on Christmas Eve borrowing a car.
00:43:52.005,00:43:53.838,We're trying to save Christmas.
00:43:54.255,00:43:56.088,"-Oh, is Christmas in trouble? -Big trouble."
00:43:56.171,00:44:05.380,"Speaking of which, it would be great if the two of you could help me -Reindeer fall under Animal Control. -Give 'em a call!"
00:44:05.463,00:44:08.171,"Okay, Santa Claus. That's enough fun for one night."
00:44:08.255,00:44:11.505,"-Gotta take you to the station. Let's go. -Wait! Look, it wasn't his fault."
00:44:12.213,00:44:15.213,This was all me. I took the car.
00:44:18.130,00:44:19.255,Teddy Pierce.
00:44:20.713,00:44:22.838,"What's this man's relationship with you, Teddy?"
00:44:23.713,00:44:24.588,"Well, he's my, um..."
00:44:25.796,00:44:28.796,"my... well, he came down my chimney."
00:44:28.880,00:44:30.588,"-What? -So, he broke into your home?"
00:44:34.421,00:44:40.171,"what he does. I-- Look, guys, okay, I wouldn't have believed him either, but..."
00:44:40.255,00:44:42.838,"-I mean, I saw the sleigh, the reindeer-- -Where do you live, son?"
00:44:44.005,00:44:44.963,Lowell.
00:44:45.588,00:44:46.546,Massachusetts.
00:44:46.630,00:44:51.338,Let me get this straight. You broke into this boy's residence -and took him a thousand miles from home? -Wait.
00:44:51.421,00:45:01.380,"This wasn't my idea! Look, Mikey, Officer Jameson-- -Impressive. You can read a name tag. -Unfortunately-- Unfortunately for you, -saving Christmas ain't in your cards. -Yeah, well, it's gonna be tight!"
00:45:05.296,00:45:06.546,What is that sound?
00:45:07.213,00:45:08.213,Sleigh bells!
00:45:10.546,00:45:11.796,Are you listening?
00:45:12.421,00:45:13.463,To what?
00:45:18.963,00:45:19.963,I'm falling!
00:45:22.130,00:45:24.130,"Comet, you can slow down!"
00:45:28.296,00:45:29.796,You're going too fast!
00:45:30.296,00:45:32.463,"All right, Kate. Slow down. Slow down, Kate!"
00:45:32.546,00:45:34.088,Whoa! Slow your roll. Get back here.
00:45:40.505,00:45:43.005,Find my sack of toys. It'll lead you to the elves.
00:45:43.088,00:45:44.046,Go!
00:45:52.213,00:45:54.213,I can't stay on! Help!
00:45:55.213,00:45:56.505,"-Attaboy, Teddy! -Hey!"
00:46:11.338,00:46:12.380,Uh-oh.
00:46:15.963,00:46:18.546,-Attach Comet's jingle bells! -Get back here!
00:46:22.380,00:46:25.088,-What did he say? -All I heard was jingle bells.
00:46:25.796,00:46:28.505,Jingle bells... Jingle bells...
00:46:43.505,00:46:44.755,Stop!
00:46:44.838,00:46:45.880,"Come on, Comet!"
00:46:46.255,00:46:48.463,Fly for me! You can do it!
00:47:01.755,00:47:03.213,You guys! Turn around!
00:47:03.296,00:47:04.463,Guys!
00:47:04.546,00:47:05.713,Just turn around!
00:47:12.421,00:47:13.463,Damn it!
00:47:18.838,00:47:20.630,"Sorry you missed it, Dave."
00:47:33.546,00:47:36.171,I can't believe it! We're flying!
00:47:36.255,00:47:37.421,I know!
00:47:39.463,00:47:41.088,I'm on Donner. What about you?
00:47:41.171,00:47:43.463,Comet! How cool is this?
00:47:48.255,00:47:49.255,Oh!
00:47:49.838,00:47:51.255,The bag of toys!
00:47:55.213,00:47:56.880,Must be around here somewhere.
00:48:03.505,00:48:05.546,Let's land. It'll be easier to find from the ground.
00:48:05.630,00:48:06.546,Okay.
00:48:22.296,00:48:23.171,Come on!
00:48:23.713,00:48:27.588,"-Hang tight and blend in! -Come on! Let's go, let's go!"
00:48:35.421,00:48:37.338,You think it's inside the church?
00:48:56.296,00:48:57.963,This was his favorite song.
00:49:04.880,00:49:07.046,"You know, I haven't been to church since he..."
00:49:08.046,00:49:10.505,I know. Me neither.
00:49:26.380,00:49:28.505,Would it kill you to leave me alone for one minute?
00:49:52.213,00:49:53.963,He would be so disappointed in me.
00:49:55.838,00:49:57.380,I know Mom sure is.
00:49:59.171,00:50:03.213,"That's because she knows, deep down, you're not such a total screw-up."
00:50:05.046,00:50:07.213,"Thanks. You're, uh... You're making me feel great."
00:50:08.421,00:50:09.255,Sorry.
00:50:12.005,00:50:13.046,"No, I deserve it."
00:50:16.088,00:50:18.505,"I know I've been an awful brother, it's just..."
00:50:21.588,00:50:23.296,I've been so mad at him.
00:50:24.880,00:50:27.838,"I mean, he spent years helping other people, but where is he now?"
00:50:29.213,00:50:30.130,When I need him?
00:50:31.921,00:50:34.213,Why did he have to go into that stupid fire?
00:50:40.963,00:50:43.421,just to save some random strangers.
00:50:48.046,00:50:50.338,"And now, I'd give anything just to tell him..."
00:50:53.213,00:50:54.255,Tell him what?
00:51:00.130,00:51:02.380,"Teddy, you aren't such an awful brother."
00:51:03.296,00:51:05.463,Dad wouldn't be disappointed in you.
00:51:06.505,00:51:07.921,You know how I know?
00:51:08.338,00:51:09.213,How?
00:51:09.838,00:51:11.880,Because I see him all the time...
00:51:12.505,00:51:13.421,in you.
00:51:16.505,00:51:19.171,You're just saying that 'cause you wanna save Christmas.
00:51:19.380,00:51:20.796,"True, but..."
00:51:21.171,00:51:22.505,I also believe it.
00:51:23.296,00:51:25.046,"You just gotta believe it, too."
00:51:27.380,00:51:28.421,"Thanks, Kate."
00:51:30.588,00:51:31.755,Should we hug it out?
00:51:34.796,00:51:36.255,In your dreams.
00:51:41.630,00:51:42.796,Come on.
00:51:57.213,00:52:01.130,Why must they keep drawing me like that?
00:52:01.213,00:52:05.463,"I mean, does my butt really look that big to you?"
00:52:06.505,00:52:07.463,Yeah.
00:52:07.838,00:52:10.130,"Now, sit down or I'll cuff you to the desk."
00:52:13.588,00:52:16.796,"Listen, pal. You can lose the shtick."
00:52:17.088,00:52:21.255,"I've had a long day, so just tell me your name, and I don't wanna hear Santa Claus."
00:52:21.338,00:52:26.296,"And you won't. Officially, it's Saint Nicholas. I prefer Saint Nick."
00:52:26.380,00:52:29.671,And I'm actually... I'm not officially an official saint.
00:52:29.755,00:52:32.588,"I mean, they haven't bestowed that title upon me officially, so..."
00:52:35.130,00:52:36.671,I'm about at the end of my rope here.
00:52:37.213,00:52:38.088,Me too.
00:52:51.005,00:52:53.213,"So, what? Did you rob a toy store, too?"
00:52:56.921,00:52:58.171,We frisked you.
00:52:58.255,00:52:59.421,"Yeah, you did."
00:52:59.796,00:53:01.380,"So, what is all this stuff?"
00:53:02.630,00:53:05.380,"You honestly don't remember, do you?"
00:53:06.421,00:53:10.713,These are all the things you ever dreamed of when you were a kid.
00:53:11.630,00:53:14.380,Everything you ever really wanted for Christmas.
00:53:15.005,00:53:17.005,Starting from the age of six.
00:53:20.713,00:53:21.588,You're right.
00:53:21.671,00:53:24.463,"Mm. Now, you interrupted me at age nine."
00:53:28.046,00:53:30.046,"Good, let's just fast-forward to this year."
00:53:31.296,00:53:32.713,You know what I want for Christmas?
00:53:36.130,00:53:38.880,"Okay, then, smart guy."
00:53:40.421,00:53:41.463,What do I want?
00:53:43.296,00:53:44.296,Lisa.
00:53:50.130,00:53:51.171,Lisa?
00:53:52.255,00:53:54.588,-Your ex-wife. -I know who Lisa is.
00:53:56.130,00:54:01.171,"-How did you-- -She left you a couple years ago, and all you want for Christmas is for her to come back."
00:54:01.463,00:54:04.630,"-Yeah, well, that ain't ever gonna happen. -Yeah, I think maybe."
00:54:04.713,00:54:07.421,"Okay, look, pal. You don't walk in here and talk about my ex-wife."
00:54:07.505,00:54:10.588,"Dave, just-- just give her a call."
00:54:13.130,00:54:16.088,"-She doesn't wanna talk to me. -Yes! Yes, she does!"
00:54:16.171,00:54:19.046,"Now, she's-- she's having second thoughts and..."
00:54:19.921,00:54:21.005,"she's lonely, too."
00:54:21.671,00:54:23.421,And she really misses you!
00:54:28.921,00:54:30.463,You know who I am!
00:54:30.546,00:54:32.713,"I mean, you've always been a suspicious, doubtful type."
00:54:32.796,00:54:34.296,That's probably why you're a good cop.
00:54:34.796,00:54:38.588,"But deep down, you know that I know what everybody wants for Christmas."
00:54:38.671,00:54:40.671,"So, just give her a call, Dave!"
00:54:47.505,00:54:49.588,I don't know how you know all this stuff.
00:54:50.713,00:54:52.505,I don't know where the reindeer came from.
00:54:52.588,00:54:55.588,"I don't know where they went, but I know what the reality is."
00:54:55.963,00:54:57.296,You stole a car.
00:54:57.380,00:55:01.796,"You evaded a police officer, not to mention child endangerment and potential kidnapping."
00:55:01.880,00:55:04.630,These are some serious charges.
00:55:04.796,00:55:05.921,Mm-hmm.
00:55:07.130,00:55:08.630,"You know what's serious, Dave?"
00:55:10.380,00:55:14.588,Christmas spirit is already down to 31%.
00:55:16.880,00:55:22.588,"The longer I stay in here, the lower it's gonna go, and the lower it goes means people are gonna start acting cranky."
00:55:23.088,00:55:24.046,Depressed.
00:55:25.088,00:55:25.963,Angry.
00:55:26.296,00:55:31.088,"And that's when bad things start to happen, like a lot more crime."
00:55:31.421,00:55:35.588,"More than you've seen here in a long time, and we're in Chicago, for goodness' sake!"
00:55:36.046,00:55:40.338,"Oh, I expect this station will be bursting at the seams come morning."
00:55:40.880,00:55:42.921,"But there is a bright spot, Dave."
00:55:45.338,00:55:47.880,There's still time for you to make it right.
00:55:52.130,00:55:53.171,Okay.
00:55:57.713,00:56:01.380,"I knew, given enough evidence, that eventually you'd come around."
00:56:03.630,00:56:08.921,I don't know if you're some kind of Las Vegas magician or a freak who hacks into people's personal lives on the Internet.
00:56:09.546,00:56:11.838,"Either way, hope you didn't make plans for New Year's."
00:56:11.921,00:56:13.505,You're gonna be here a while.
00:56:23.713,00:56:25.088,"Teddy, look!"
00:56:41.171,00:56:42.463,"Be careful, Teddy!"
00:56:43.005,00:56:44.171,Don't fall.
00:56:58.671,00:56:59.505,Elves?
00:57:00.380,00:57:03.171,We're with Santa and we need your help!
00:57:04.130,00:57:05.171,Hello?
00:57:06.088,00:57:07.588,Anybody in there?
00:57:09.005,00:57:10.338,What are you doing?
00:57:11.255,00:57:12.963,I'm just looking!
00:57:18.630,00:57:20.005,Anybody there?
00:57:23.588,00:57:24.546,Kate!
00:57:27.213,00:57:28.213,Kate!
00:57:36.671,00:57:37.796,"Hey, what you doing?"
00:57:39.213,00:57:40.630,What's inside that bag?
00:57:41.005,00:57:42.421,Who you talking to?
00:57:42.505,00:57:43.421,"Nothing, nobody."
00:57:43.880,00:57:45.505,"Well, that ain't what it sounded like."
00:57:48.296,00:57:49.380,"Okay, respect."
00:57:49.796,00:57:52.005,"If it's okay with you, I'll just be on my way."
00:57:53.630,00:57:55.213,Nobody said it was okay.
00:57:55.713,00:57:56.921,"Come on, guys."
00:57:59.713,00:58:01.546,Why are we even bothering with this fool?
00:58:02.088,00:58:03.255,"Yeah, you're right."
00:58:04.005,00:58:05.796,Just hand over that bag.
00:58:07.421,00:58:08.296,"No, I can't do that."
00:58:10.255,00:58:11.421,-Tough guy over here. -Oh yeah!
00:58:13.921,00:58:15.505,You think you're a tough guy?
00:58:16.921,00:58:19.213,What can possibly be in that bag...
00:58:19.713,00:58:22.213,that could be worth what's about to happen to you?
00:58:25.213,00:58:26.505,You're coming with us.
00:58:41.046,00:58:43.046,"Teddy, this is incredible!"
00:58:44.963,00:58:46.046,Elves!
00:58:46.755,00:58:48.213,Anyone there?
00:58:55.880,00:58:58.046,Hey! Come back!
00:59:14.880,00:59:16.088,Whoa!
00:59:56.921,00:59:59.463,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
01:00:20.171,01:00:21.963,That is so cool.
01:01:34.588,01:01:37.046,especially since I got a D minus in Spanish.
01:01:37.588,01:01:41.338,"Dear Santa, This year we would like a pony for Christmas."
01:01:41.421,01:01:44.380,"But Mom says the house is too small, so maybe just a puppy."
01:01:49.630,01:01:52.921,"I'm Bing Bellamy, and all I want for Christmas is a snowboard!"
01:03:16.921,01:03:18.588,Teddy wrote one this year?
01:03:26.921,01:03:29.796,"Dear Santa, This is Teddy Pierce."
01:03:29.880,01:03:32.088,I haven't written to you in a long time.
01:03:32.505,01:03:36.671,"You know how it is, once you get older, the whole Christmas thing seems pretty lame."
01:03:37.546,01:03:39.338,But this year is different.
01:03:39.505,01:03:41.671,"This year, I have a special request."
01:03:41.880,01:03:44.171,I'd really like to see my dad again.
01:03:45.671,01:03:48.046,I'm not even sure if it's something you can do.
01:03:48.630,01:04:30.421,But I really need to tell him that-- Hello.
01:04:34.005,01:04:35.755,He-llo?
01:04:36.755,01:04:38.046,I'm Kate.
01:04:38.546,01:04:39.505,What's your name?
01:04:57.421,01:04:58.588,Santa sent me.
01:05:03.880,01:05:04.921,Guys?
01:05:13.630,01:05:15.088,What are you doing with my camera?
01:05:25.088,01:05:26.880,"Hey, come on, let me out!"
01:05:26.963,01:05:29.338,Let me out of here! Let me out of here!
01:05:40.421,01:05:57.838,"You see, after the sleigh crashed, He said you guys were the only ones who would know what to do!"
01:05:57.921,01:05:59.796,He said Christmas must endure!
01:06:03.880,01:06:05.588,Christmas must endure?
01:06:08.296,01:06:09.171,Ah!
01:06:09.630,01:06:10.755,Hmm...
01:06:34.005,01:06:36.213,Everybody except Teddy.
01:06:39.921,01:07:11.213,"But, wow! I come from a long line Oh, you're gonna walk away from me? Huh?"
01:07:11.296,01:07:13.296,I saw a bunch of reindeer fly into the night sky!
01:07:14.921,01:07:16.921,"Man, have you ever seen anything like this?"
01:07:17.005,01:07:19.130,I've never seen it this busy on Christmas Eve.
01:07:21.588,01:07:23.255,He said this would happen.
01:07:28.880,01:07:31.338,The least you could do is play some Christmas music.
01:07:32.588,01:07:34.921,"-Am I right, Santa? -I hear you."
01:07:35.963,01:07:46.921,"Oh, brother, the mood in this place is really bringing Christmas spirit down, Whoa! Christmas spirit is down to 19%?"
01:07:47.005,01:07:48.921,"If I don't do something quick, this night's over."
01:07:49.671,01:07:51.130,"Wait a minute, music!"
01:07:51.213,01:07:52.838,Maybe you're onto something!
01:07:56.713,01:08:01.588,Do you remember what you got for Christmas in 1971?
01:08:07.963,01:08:12.963,"I got the super fly Sunburst Epiphone Casino, man!"
01:08:13.213,01:08:14.588,Two-tone Gretsch Anniversary.
01:08:14.671,01:08:15.796,Where are they now?
01:08:16.213,01:08:18.255,"In, uh... In the pawn shop."
01:08:19.838,01:08:22.463,'Cause you two guys were really good.
01:08:23.380,01:08:26.505,"Unfortunately, some other habits took precedence, you dig?"
01:08:28.880,01:08:30.713,But this is Christmas Eve...
01:08:31.963,01:08:34.713,and that means there's magic in the air!
01:08:38.421,01:08:39.546,-Magic. -Wow!
01:08:43.088,01:08:45.505,"-What am I supposed to do with this, man? -Play it."
01:08:48.755,01:08:49.630,Give it a try.
01:10:16.671,01:10:18.088,"Talk to me, ladies!"
01:10:26.213,01:10:28.005,Is there a piano in this joint?
01:10:33.630,01:10:34.546,Oh!
01:11:01.588,01:11:02.588,What do we got here?
01:11:07.630,01:11:09.796,"Well, Christmas came early this year, huh?"
01:11:11.296,01:11:12.671,Where did you get this?
01:11:12.963,01:11:14.171,From this little dude.
01:11:16.213,01:11:17.171,Ah.
01:11:27.213,01:11:28.213,Coal?
01:11:31.588,01:11:32.921,Is this some kind of a joke?
01:11:49.880,01:11:51.838,Next time you morons waste my time...
01:11:59.088,01:12:00.255,you're done.
01:12:05.671,01:12:08.588,"No! No, my sister's in there!"
01:12:10.671,01:12:11.880,Your sister?
01:12:15.046,01:12:17.755,"Look, I know it sounds crazy, but please don't do that!"
01:12:28.046,01:12:30.546,Get back! Get back!
01:12:36.171,01:12:37.380,Take care of him!
01:12:39.755,01:12:41.755,Oh... and not recycling.
01:12:42.588,01:12:43.671,He's compost.
01:12:52.963,01:12:54.171,Ah!
01:12:55.463,01:12:56.880,What is that thing?
01:12:57.296,01:12:58.838,"Hey, he's-- he's actually kinda cute."
01:13:02.463,01:13:04.213,"Hey, little guy! What's your name?"
01:14:31.588,01:14:33.755,Wait! I'm one of the good guys!
01:14:37.421,01:14:38.296,Stop!
01:14:40.505,01:14:41.755,He's with me.
01:14:50.546,01:14:51.838,And I brought help!
01:14:54.171,01:14:56.796,-Let's get the reindeer and the sleigh. -The sleigh's busted.
01:14:57.296,01:14:58.130,Right.
01:14:58.546,01:14:59.880,Can you guys fix it?
01:15:08.171,01:15:09.755,You guys know where he is?
01:15:18.588,01:15:20.005,One more thing!
01:15:33.380,01:15:35.255,Down your chimney!
01:15:48.046,01:15:49.546,Listen to me now!
01:16:04.671,01:16:06.505,"Yeah, I'm back!"
01:16:15.255,01:16:18.505,And the reindeer just... flew away!
01:16:28.588,01:16:30.921,"Not too bad for our first gig, huh?"
01:16:31.588,01:16:34.713,"I have seen a lot of strange things in my time, but this..."
01:16:35.255,01:16:37.921,this takes it to a whole other level.
01:16:38.005,01:16:40.088,"Oh, wait till you see what happens next."
01:16:40.171,01:16:43.130,"Okay, I want answers. Real answers, right now."
01:16:43.505,01:16:45.130,"We all want answers, Dave."
01:16:45.588,01:16:46.505,Especially Lisa.
01:16:47.755,01:16:49.755,"So first, why don't you answer that?"
01:17:10.921,01:17:18.713,Why are you c-- Yeah.
01:17:20.380,01:17:21.630,That'd be great.
01:17:22.296,01:17:23.130,Good.
01:17:24.130,01:17:24.963,Okay.
01:17:27.921,01:17:28.921,Lisa.
01:17:30.880,01:17:32.880,She invited me out for coffee this morning.
01:17:32.963,01:17:34.338,I thought she might.
01:17:35.880,01:17:36.921,How?
01:17:37.630,01:17:38.505,I mean...
01:17:39.755,01:17:40.588,How?
01:17:44.546,01:17:46.046,"Merry Christmas, Dave."
01:17:51.755,01:17:53.755,"Well, that's, uh... That's my little buddy Hugg."
01:17:53.838,01:17:56.255,"He's, uh... bringing me a present."
01:18:19.046,01:18:20.255,That's my cue!
01:18:21.171,01:18:22.421,Christmas...
01:18:25.796,01:18:26.880,is back on.
01:18:29.255,01:18:30.380,"Oh, um..."
01:18:38.546,01:18:40.505,"We can keep these, right, Santa?"
01:18:42.255,01:18:43.255,"Well, Dave?"
01:18:54.005,01:18:56.171,-Go. -Welcome back.
01:19:06.338,01:19:07.755,I can't believe it!
01:19:07.838,01:19:11.088,"-You busted outta jail! -First time for everything, Katie Cat!"
01:19:11.546,01:19:13.796,How's the sleigh looking? Oh...
01:19:27.088,01:19:28.963,I lost all track of time.
01:19:35.463,01:19:38.296,"But... we can still save Christmas, right?"
01:19:40.171,01:19:42.005,"We're at the end of my window, Kate."
01:19:45.463,01:19:47.880,"Well... I mean, there's gotta be something we can do."
01:19:49.171,01:19:50.463,"I'm afraid not, Teddy."
01:19:50.921,01:19:54.421,But that can't be! There can't be Christmas without presents!
01:20:05.421,01:20:07.755,"We started something last night, and we're gonna finish it."
01:20:07.838,01:20:11.380,"Now, I don't know how you guys do things in the North Pole, but..."
01:20:11.921,01:20:13.671,a Pierce always sees it through.
01:20:15.963,01:20:17.755,"I admire your passion, Teddy."
01:20:19.171,01:20:21.880,"But I haven't cut it this close in, I don't know, maybe ever."
01:20:21.963,01:20:23.838,I-- I just don't see how it's possible.
01:20:23.921,01:20:26.796,You do the entire world in one night all by yourself!
01:20:26.880,01:20:30.046,"I mean, imagine what we could cover if we all work together!"
01:20:32.005,01:20:34.421,Just think of us as Santa's helpers!
01:20:36.005,01:20:37.046,Helpers?
01:20:38.130,01:20:41.005,"Well, I've never had human helpers in the sleigh before..."
01:20:42.963,01:20:44.255,"I dunno, maybe there's..."
01:20:44.755,01:20:46.755,some way we could work together to...
01:20:47.338,01:20:49.171,make things move faster.
01:20:49.255,01:20:51.838,We've only got a little bit of North America left.
01:20:51.921,01:20:52.796,Wait a minute!
01:20:53.505,01:20:54.671,Wait a minute...
01:20:55.588,01:20:59.046,"If I didn't have to carry my sack, I could move twice as fast!"
01:20:59.380,01:21:00.671,"All right, this just might work!"
01:21:00.755,01:21:03.630,"Now, Kate, you're in charge of getting all the presents ready to go!"
01:21:03.713,01:21:07.130,"You just call out the addresses and the names, and you throw 'em outta the sack."
01:21:07.213,01:21:10.171,"Just chuck 'em out. I'll catch 'em, and I'll deliver!"
01:21:10.255,01:21:12.338,"And that means, Teddy, you drive!"
01:21:12.796,01:21:14.588,What? The sleigh?
01:21:14.671,01:21:16.338,No! The cop cruiser!
01:21:16.421,01:21:18.005,Of course the sleigh!
01:21:27.255,01:21:31.171,Now where is all that huff and puff about A Pierce always sees it through?
01:21:31.255,01:21:33.671,That was before you told me I was gonna have to drive!
01:21:34.046,01:21:38.630,"Well, this is the only way we're gonna make it, so I guess it's gonna be baptism by fire!"
01:21:38.838,01:21:41.296,"Well, maybe I can help Kate with presents, right?"
01:21:43.171,01:21:45.713,"I told you, we're gonna have to move fast!"
01:21:48.921,01:21:50.421,Come on! Hop in the back!
01:22:00.588,01:22:02.130,"All right, Teddy, stand up!"
01:22:02.546,01:22:03.380,Take them!
01:22:03.463,01:22:04.671,-What? -Come on!
01:22:05.005,01:22:06.588,"All right, you gotta hold them."
01:22:06.713,01:22:08.713,Now we're gonna see what you're made of!
01:22:08.796,01:22:11.255,"Now, just think about where you wanna go..."
01:22:11.880,01:22:12.713,and go!
01:22:13.005,01:22:15.380,"Oh no, no, no, no! Santa, I can't do this!"
01:22:15.463,01:22:17.505,"Some things we gotta figure out on our own, Teddy."
01:22:19.838,01:22:23.755,"All right, here's the book with all the names and addresses."
01:22:29.796,01:22:33.088,"If there's one thing reindeer can smell, it's fear!"
01:22:33.171,01:22:34.713,"Santa, help him!"
01:22:39.838,01:22:42.130,Eight reindeer! How tough can it be?!
01:22:45.255,01:22:46.505,"Teddy, watch out!"
01:22:51.130,01:22:52.963,"Take that, fat man!"
01:23:05.713,01:23:08.546,"You've always just had to do one thing, Teddy."
01:23:10.421,01:23:11.588,Believe.
01:23:11.671,01:23:15.088,"-But I do believe in you! -No, no, no! I'm not talking about me."
01:23:15.713,01:23:17.463,You have to believe in yourself.
01:23:18.421,01:23:20.671,The way your mother believes in you.
01:23:21.088,01:23:22.630,And your sister.
01:23:24.463,01:23:27.130,The way your father believed in you.
01:23:30.505,01:23:32.171,"You are a Pierce, Teddy!"
01:23:32.921,01:23:34.046,And a Pierce...
01:23:38.171,01:23:40.296,"Let's go, young man!"
01:23:40.380,01:23:43.130,"On, Dasher! On, Dancer! On, Prancer! On, Vixen!"
01:23:43.213,01:23:46.296,"On, Comet! On, Cupid! On, Donner! On, Blitzen!"
01:23:48.963,01:23:50.338,"All right, slow them down."
01:23:57.213,01:23:58.838,All right! Here we go!
01:24:04.463,01:24:06.005,Tony Brooks!
01:24:09.838,01:24:11.338,Adam Maple!
01:24:12.088,01:24:13.005,Timmy Burks!
01:24:20.963,01:24:22.546,James Hanson!
01:24:26.546,01:24:27.588,Show-off!
01:25:15.088,01:25:17.880,"-All right, this one's to... -Ah!"
01:25:51.588,01:25:53.671,Kate! Send in the troops!
01:25:54.130,01:25:55.255,The troops?
01:25:56.088,01:25:57.088,The troops!
01:25:58.171,01:26:00.505,Guys! Santa needs you!
01:26:10.713,01:26:13.255,2547 East 26th Place!
01:26:20.338,01:26:22.755,2540 East 28th Street!
01:26:24.505,01:26:27.380,"Jessica Martin, 8470 Franklin Avenue!"
01:26:27.463,01:26:29.838,"Dino Arnali, 139 Pond Street!"
01:26:29.921,01:26:32.213,"Sion Pack, 1902 Ridley Street."
01:26:38.296,01:26:41.421,"Ray, Scarlett, and Brooke Stuber, 3947 Jackson Street!"
01:26:41.630,01:26:43.505,"Sheila Vondersack, 341 Wood Street!"
01:26:43.588,01:27:23.213,"Jennifer Lesbilenti, Hey, what's he doing?"
01:27:23.296,01:27:26.130,His list. He's checking it twice.
01:27:30.838,01:27:32.505,What is this?
01:27:34.171,01:27:35.213,Bjorn...
01:27:50.130,01:27:54.171,"Sanchez family, Mexico City! We got exactly nine seconds!"
01:27:54.421,01:27:56.130,"Teddy, want me to take the reins?"
01:27:56.213,01:27:58.755,"Yah! On, Dasher! On, Dancer! On, Prancer!"
01:28:07.963,01:28:11.963,"-There's no chimney! -Well, sometimes you gotta improvise!"
01:28:12.380,01:28:13.296,Ha!
01:28:13.380,01:28:16.005,-How much time we got? -Three seconds.
01:28:36.213,01:28:37.338,Shh!
01:28:55.755,01:28:59.755,"All the presents delivered in record time, and Christmas spirit is up to 95%."
01:29:01.463,01:29:04.005,"Hey, hey! We gotta get back to your house before your mom does!"
01:29:04.088,01:29:04.963,Here.
01:29:08.421,01:29:13.005,"On, Dasher! On, Dancer! On, Prancer! On, Vixen! On, Comet! On, Cupid!"
01:29:13.088,01:29:14.671,"On, Donner! On, Blitzen!"
01:29:24.171,01:29:26.255,"Ease them down, that's it. Easy."
01:29:27.005,01:29:28.338,"All right, pick your spot."
01:29:39.130,01:29:41.713,-What was your favorite part? -Easy! Riding the reindeer!
01:29:46.713,01:29:48.505,"Hey, that was the best night of my whole life!"
01:29:48.588,01:29:49.421,"Mine, too."
01:29:49.505,01:29:53.005,"Oh, Christmas Eve is always the best night of my life."
01:29:54.296,01:29:56.713,"But now, it's time for me to go home."
01:29:58.671,01:30:00.130,Will we ever see you again?
01:30:00.213,01:30:02.046,Uh-uh. Not if I can help it.
01:30:02.338,01:30:06.005,"But in the future, if I ever need two helpers..."
01:30:07.005,01:30:09.630,I know where to find the best I've ever had.
01:30:25.671,01:30:28.171,He said the best human helpers he's ever had.
01:30:31.921,01:30:33.963,Now that you've learned another language.
01:30:34.046,01:30:35.005,Oh no!
01:30:44.463,01:30:46.046,Something I want you to have.
01:30:50.671,01:30:51.838,Your hat?
01:30:52.255,01:30:54.755,But... won't you need it to fly?
01:30:55.630,01:30:56.796,"No, Teddy."
01:30:58.921,01:31:00.505,I'm Santa Claus.
01:31:13.713,01:31:15.880,"-anytime you wanted, you could've just-- -Shh."
01:31:19.005,01:31:21.963,"All right, now, I don't want any more people to see me, so..."
01:31:22.546,01:31:24.130,-Santa? -Yeah?
01:31:24.463,01:31:25.505,Can you do it?
01:31:28.338,01:31:29.546,-Please? -Not happening.
01:31:29.630,01:31:30.505,-For me? -Kate!
01:31:30.588,01:31:31.755,Just this once!
01:31:35.588,01:31:37.046,Just this once.
01:31:46.338,01:31:47.338,Be good.
01:31:49.546,01:31:50.588,We will.
01:32:14.880,01:32:20.380,Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!
01:32:34.921,01:32:36.213,Oh man!
01:32:36.463,01:32:37.546,He took the tape.
01:32:40.796,01:32:42.130,"Guess not, but..."
01:32:42.713,01:32:44.880,what if I forget everything that happened tonight?
01:32:45.505,01:32:48.338,Come on! I won't let you forget anything about tonight...
01:32:48.421,01:32:49.463,Katie Cat.
01:32:50.338,01:32:52.213,"Me neither, Teddy Bear."
01:33:03.796,01:33:05.880,Were you two just... hugging?
01:33:08.880,01:33:10.755,What are you guys doing out here?
01:33:12.838,01:33:14.296,Waiting for you.
01:33:18.880,01:33:21.255,It was a-- a gift from a friend.
01:33:21.713,01:33:23.921,"Hmm. Merry Christmas, guys!"
01:33:27.296,01:33:29.338,We should go inside. It's freezing out here.
01:33:40.671,01:33:45.838,"Well, what did you guys do all ni-- Oh, my God!"
01:33:48.421,01:33:50.671,This is exactly the way Dad used to...
01:33:55.380,01:33:58.130,This is the best Christmas present ever.
01:34:21.880,01:34:24.505,Aunt Peggy sure outdid herself this year.
01:34:26.088,01:34:27.213,What are those two?
01:34:32.380,01:34:33.213,It's from Santa!
01:34:35.088,01:34:36.088,It's for you.
01:34:38.255,01:34:41.005,I was kinda worried you weren't going to make the cut this year.
01:34:41.505,01:34:44.588,Yeah. Guess I kinda worked it out in the final hour.
01:34:47.005,01:34:49.213,-Oh boy! -Yes!
01:34:50.088,01:34:51.630,Just what I asked for.
01:34:59.171,01:35:00.421,What's that?
01:35:01.463,01:35:02.796,Santa wrote me back.
01:35:05.338,01:35:06.880,You wrote Santa a letter?
01:35:12.713,01:35:13.963,"Well, what's it say?"
01:35:15.505,01:35:17.880,"Dear Teddy, I got your letter."
01:35:17.963,01:35:21.546,"I'm sorry, I don't really have the power to grant your wish."
01:35:21.963,01:35:23.796,This was the best I could do.
01:35:24.171,01:35:25.088,Santa.
01:35:34.796,01:35:36.213,An old ornament...
01:35:37.671,01:35:38.963,"Well, that's sweet."
01:35:40.463,01:35:42.796,There's a perfect spot for it on the tree.
01:35:50.171,01:35:52.088,"-So, you're gonna wear a helmet with this? -Yes."
01:35:52.171,01:35:53.046,Let's see.
01:36:17.213,01:36:18.463,I'm proud of you.
01:36:20.005,01:36:21.463,I'm proud of you.
01:36:31.255,01:36:33.130,-Yeah. -Everything okay?
01:36:35.546,01:36:36.713,Never better.
01:37:05.296,01:37:06.338,Uh...
01:37:22.630,01:37:23.588,No...
01:37:24.255,01:37:28.088,"Oh, you know how the elves exaggerate. They get excited at the drop of a hat."
01:37:29.755,01:37:31.880,Especially when it's yours.
01:37:35.921,01:37:37.088,Purely intentional.
01:37:44.130,01:37:46.713,Were you just a little bit naughty last night?
01:37:50.171,01:37:53.213,"Mm, I... In a nice way."
01:37:54.838,01:37:56.463,That's why I love you.
01:38:01.630,01:38:02.505,Mm.
01:38:02.713,01:38:04.255,It's a Wonderful Life?
01:38:04.338,01:38:05.546,White Christmas?
01:38:05.963,01:38:07.380,The Grinch!
01:38:11.130,01:38:13.546,I had something else in mind.
01:38:15.588,01:38:18.588,Something... really cool.
01:39:32.088,01:39:33.838,"Talk to me, ladies!"
01:40:33.338,01:40:34.671,Listen to me now!
