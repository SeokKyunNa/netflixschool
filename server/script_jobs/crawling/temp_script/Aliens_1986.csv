00:04:59.875,00:05:04.166,MAN: Bio readouts are all in the green.
00:05:06.833,00:05:09.625,"Well, there goes our salvage, guys."
00:05:36.125,00:05:37.708,How are we today?
00:05:37.791,00:05:39.291,Ohh. Terrible.
00:05:39.416,00:05:41.250,"Well, better than yesterday, at least."
00:05:42.416,00:05:44.666,Where am I?
00:05:45.208,00:05:47.625,You're at Gateway Station.
00:05:47.750,00:05:50.375,"You were pretty groggy at first, but now you're okay."
00:05:51.208,00:05:52.833,"Oh, looks like you've got a visitor."
00:05:55.708,00:05:57.916,Jonesy. Come here.
00:05:59.083,00:06:00.750,"Hey, come here."
00:06:01.291,00:06:03.416,"How are you, you stupid cat?"
00:06:03.791,00:06:06.500,How are you?
00:06:07.708,00:06:11.625,"Guess you two have met, huh?"
00:06:11.708,00:06:16.208,"I work for the company, but don't let that fool you."
00:06:17.750,00:06:19.416,I'm glad to see you're feeling a little better.
00:06:20.333,00:06:23.166,They tell me that all the weakness and disorientation should pass soon.
00:06:23.291,00:06:29.083,"That's just natural side effects of such an unusually long hypersleep, or something like that."
00:06:29.166,00:06:31.291,What do you mean?
00:06:32.000,00:06:33.458,How long was I out there?
00:06:33.583,00:06:35.958,"Inhalation therapy, report to..."
00:06:36.041,00:06:38.208,Has no one discussed this with you yet?
00:06:38.291,00:06:40.333,"No. But, I mean..."
00:06:40.458,00:06:44.541,I don't... Recognize this place.
00:06:44.666,00:06:46.500,"No, I know. Uh..."
00:06:46.625,00:06:50.375,"Okay. It's just that, uh, this might be a shock to you."
00:06:50.500,00:06:53.125,It's long...
00:06:53.500,00:06:55.000,Please.
00:06:56.166,00:06:59.958,Fifty-seven years.
00:07:00.041,00:07:04.166,That's the thing.
00:07:04.291,00:07:07.583,What happened was you had drifted right through the core systems.
00:07:08.083,00:07:10.458,And it's really just blind luck...
00:07:10.541,00:07:13.916,That a deep-salvage team found you when they did.
00:07:14.000,00:07:16.041,"It's one in a thousand, really."
00:07:16.333,00:07:20.416,"I think you're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo. You could be floating out there forever."
00:07:21.083,00:07:23.916,You... You okay?
00:07:25.958,00:07:27.208,Uhh...
00:07:33.666,00:07:34.875,BURKE: You okay?
00:07:41.875,00:07:45.208,"Oh-h-h! Oh, God!"
00:07:47.375,00:07:50.208,Nurse! Please!
00:07:50.583,00:07:53.500,Someone get in here now!
00:07:53.833,00:07:55.375,Now!
00:07:55.583,00:07:57.708,Hold!
00:07:58.208,00:08:00.041,Hold on!
00:08:00.708,00:08:02.000,Kill me!
00:08:10.458,00:08:11.625,No!
00:08:11.916,00:08:13.291,No!
00:08:19.458,00:08:22.541,Bad dreams again?
00:08:22.958,00:08:24.208,No.
00:08:25.375,00:08:27.041,I've slept enough.
00:08:28.916,00:08:30.583,Jonesy.
00:08:31.291,00:08:32.750,Come here.
00:08:33.333,00:08:35.666,Shh.
00:08:39.583,00:08:41.083,It's all right.
00:08:42.708,00:08:44.916,It's all right now.
00:08:46.541,00:08:48.041,It's over.
00:08:51.458,00:08:53.041,"MAN 1: I'd just like to go, uh..."
00:08:53.791,00:08:56.500,Back to this point about the override destruct order.
00:08:56.625,00:08:59.958,MAN 2: Is it in the file?
00:09:00.083,00:09:03.333,We have been here for three and a half hours.
00:09:03.458,00:09:05.958,"Now, how many different ways do you want me to tell the same story?"
00:09:06.958,00:09:09.625,"Look at it from our perspective, please."
00:09:11.000,00:09:12.541,Please?
00:09:15.375,00:09:23.208,"Now, you freely admit to detonating the engines of, and thereby destroying, an M-class starfreighter, a rather expensive piece of hardware."
00:09:23.291,00:09:26.625,Forty-two million in adjusted dollars.
00:09:26.708,00:09:28.625,"That's minus payload, of course."
00:09:29.541,00:09:43.708,"The lifeboat's flight recorder corroborates some elements of your account, in that, for reasons unknown, the Nostromo set down on LV-426, an unsurveyed planet at that time, that it resumed its course..."
00:09:43.833,00:09:48.458,And was subsequently set for self-destruct by you for reasons unknown.
00:09:48.541,00:09:51.125,Not for reasons unknown.
00:09:51.208,00:09:57.000,"We set down there on company orders to get this thing, which destroyed my crew..."
00:09:57.083,00:09:59.166,And your expensive ship.
00:09:59.666,00:10:06.083,"The analysis team, which went over the lifeboat centimeter by centimeter, found no physical evidence of the creature you describe."
00:10:06.166,00:10:13.916,"Good! That's because I blew it out of the goddamn air lock, like I said."
00:10:16.916,00:10:20.625,Are there any species like this hostile organism on LV-426?
00:10:20.708,00:10:23.000,No. It's a rock.
00:10:25.375,00:10:28.791,Did I.Q.'s just drop sharply while I was away?
00:10:28.875,00:10:31.333,"Ma'am, I already said that it was not indigenous."
00:10:31.416,00:10:34.000,It was a derelict spacecraft.
00:10:34.083,00:10:37.125,It was not from there.
00:10:37.208,00:10:38.666,We homed in on its beacon.
00:10:39.041,00:10:41.708,And found something never recorded once...
00:10:41.833,00:10:45.250,In over 300 surveyed worlds.
00:10:45.375,00:10:49.958,A creature that gestates inside a living human host.
00:10:50.041,00:10:53.708,These are your words.
00:10:53.875,00:10:55.041,That's right.
00:10:56.583,00:11:03.041,"Look. I can see where this is going, but I'm telling you that those things exist."
00:11:03.125,00:11:04.750,"Thank you, Officer Ripley."
00:11:04.833,00:11:07.750,Please.
00:11:08.916,00:11:12.583,"Kane, who went into that ship, said he saw thousands of eggs there."
00:11:12.666,00:11:14.666,Thousands.
00:11:14.750,00:11:16.833,"God damn it, that's not all!"
00:11:17.166,00:11:19.625,"Because if one of those things gets down here, then that will be all!"
00:11:19.750,00:11:23.375,Then all of this...
00:11:23.458,00:11:25.375,You can just kiss all of that good-bye!
00:11:42.708,00:11:44.375,That could have been better.
00:11:44.958,00:11:47.666,"Look, I think the..."
00:11:48.583,00:11:51.750,Why don't you just check out LV-426?
00:11:51.833,00:11:55.625,Because I don't have to.
00:11:51.833,00:11:58.166,"There have been people there for over 20 years, and they never complained about any hostile organism."
00:11:58.291,00:12:00.500,What do you mean?
00:12:00.625,00:12:03.375,Terraformers.
00:12:03.791,00:12:07.666,"They go in, set up these big atmosphere processors to make the air breathable."
00:12:07.791,00:12:09.125,Takes decades.
00:12:09.833,00:12:11.916,It's what we call a Shake 'n Bake colony.
00:12:12.750,00:12:15.625,How many are there?
00:12:16.291,00:12:18.750,I don't know...
00:12:19.000,00:12:20.166,Do you mind?
00:12:23.041,00:12:24.875,Families.
00:12:27.416,00:12:29.250,Jesus.
00:13:05.833,00:13:08.083,"Hiya, Ripley."
00:13:05.833,00:13:10.458,This is Lieutenant Gorman of the Colonial Marine Corps...
00:13:11.375,00:13:13.708,"Ripley, we have to talk."
00:13:13.791,00:13:17.083,We've lost contact with the colony on LV-426.
00:13:24.083,00:13:26.250,I don't believe this.
00:13:26.375,00:13:30.875,"You guys throw me at the wolves, and now you want me to go back out there?"
00:13:30.958,00:13:33.041,Forget it.
00:13:34.041,00:13:36.500,Can I finish?
00:13:38.750,00:13:40.750,"Ripley, you wouldn't be going in with the troops."
00:13:40.875,00:13:43.083,I can guarantee your safety.
00:13:43.166,00:13:46.416,These Colonial Marines are very tough hombres.
00:13:46.541,00:13:48.750,They're packing state-of-the-art firepower.
00:13:48.875,00:13:50.958,There's nothing they can't handle.
00:13:51.416,00:13:53.708,"Lieutenant, am I right?"
00:13:53.791,00:13:56.041,We've been trained to deal with situations like this.
00:13:56.125,00:13:58.916,need me. I'm not a soldier.
00:13:59.750,00:14:02.291,"BURKE: Yeah, but we don't know exactly what's going on out there."
00:14:02.416,00:14:04.458,"It may just be a downed transmitter, okay?"
00:14:04.583,00:14:10.416,"But if it's not, I would like you there as an adviser, and that's all."
00:14:11.708,00:14:12.916,"Look, I don't have time for this."
00:14:13.000,00:14:14.416,I've got to get going.
00:14:14.916,00:14:17.708,"Oh, right. I heard you're working the cargo docks."
00:14:18.875,00:14:19.916,That's right.
00:14:20.041,00:14:22.666,"Running loaders and forklifts, that sort of thing?"
00:14:22.791,00:14:25.958,Nothing. I think it's great that you're keeping busy.
00:14:26.083,00:14:28.458,And I know it's the only thing that you could get.
00:14:28.583,00:14:30.416,There's nothing wrong with it.
00:14:33.666,00:14:37.791,What would you say if I told you I could get you reinstated as a flight officer?
00:14:37.875,00:14:42.625,The company's already agreed to pick up your contract.
00:14:44.833,00:14:46.416,"Yeah, if you go."
00:14:46.500,00:14:48.708,Come on.
00:14:48.791,00:14:53.958,"I think, personally, for you, it would be the best thing in the world, to get out there and face this thing, get back on the horse."
00:14:54.083,00:14:56.708,"Spare me, Burke."
00:14:57.208,00:14:58.958,"Yeah, I know."
00:14:59.083,00:15:01.000,You wake up every night.
00:15:01.125,00:15:03.166,"I said no, and I mean it!"
00:15:06.166,00:15:09.041,"Now, please leave."
00:15:09.166,00:15:12.291,And I am... I would not be any good to you if I did.
00:15:13.041,00:15:15.000,Okay. Shh.
00:15:17.083,00:15:19.833,Would you do me a favor?
00:15:23.625,00:15:25.166,Thanks for the coffee.
00:15:45.291,00:15:46.583,Oh!
00:16:33.958,00:16:35.333,Hello.
00:16:35.958,00:16:39.250,Ripley. You okay?
00:16:39.375,00:16:41.458,"Just tell me one thing, Burke."
00:16:42.458,00:16:45.541,"You're going out there to destroy them, right?"
00:16:45.625,00:16:50.458,"Not to study, not to bring back, but to wipe them out."
00:16:51.708,00:16:54.250,That's the plan.
00:16:57.708,00:17:00.041,All right. I'm in.
00:17:09.291,00:17:13.625,"And you, you little shithead, you're staying here."
00:18:21.500,00:18:23.541,Mmm.
00:18:38.750,00:18:42.041,"They ain't payin' us enough for this, man."
00:18:42.750,00:18:45.458,"Not enough to have to wake up to your face, Drake."
00:18:45.541,00:18:46.833,What?
00:18:47.333,00:18:50.375,Is that a joke?
00:18:50.458,00:18:55.375,"Hey, Hicks. Man, you look just like I feel."
00:18:55.875,00:18:59.416,"All right, sweethearts."
00:18:59.541,00:19:03.083,Breakfast in bed?
00:19:03.208,00:19:06.208,A day in the Marine Corps is like a day on the farm...
00:19:06.291,00:19:11.375,"Every meal's a banquet, every paycheck a fortune, every formation a parade."
00:19:11.458,00:19:13.041,I love the Corps!
00:19:13.208,00:19:15.375,"Man, this floor is freezing!"
00:19:15.458,00:19:17.125,What do you want me to do?
00:19:17.250,00:19:19.250,"Gee, would you, sir?"
00:19:19.916,00:19:22.583,Look into my eye.
00:19:23.083,00:19:25.041,Come on. Let's go.
00:19:25.125,00:19:26.500,I hate this job.
00:19:26.583,00:19:28.208,"Crowe, Wierzbowski."
00:19:28.291,00:19:29.500,Come on. On your feet.
00:19:29.583,00:19:32.791,"You had three weeks on your back, Frost."
00:19:32.916,00:19:35.041,"FROST: I'm talking about breathing, not this frozen shit."
00:19:35.125,00:19:37.166,"DIETRICH: Yeah, top."
00:19:40.458,00:19:44.708,APONE: All right.
00:19:46.000,00:19:48.666,"Hey, Mira."
00:19:49.750,00:19:52.166,She's supposed to be some kind of consultant.
00:19:52.250,00:19:54.583,"Apparently, she saw an alien once."
00:19:54.750,00:19:59.125,Whoopee-fuckin'-do!
00:20:02.041,00:20:06.291,"Hey, Vasquez."
00:20:06.416,00:20:08.458,No. Have you?
00:20:08.541,00:20:13.333,"Ha, ha! Oh, Vasquez."
00:20:14.041,00:20:15.166,Uhh!
00:20:24.208,00:20:26.458,"Hey, top, what's the op?"
00:20:26.833,00:20:28.958,It's a rescue mission.
00:20:29.041,00:20:32.625,There's some juicy colonists' daughters we have to rescue from their virginity.
00:20:33.791,00:20:36.333,SPUNKMEYER: Dumb-ass colonists.
00:20:39.833,00:20:42.333,What's this crap supposed to be?
00:20:42.416,00:20:45.291,"Corn bread, I think."
00:20:45.375,00:20:49.166,"Hey, sure wouldn't mind getting some more of that Arcturian poontang."
00:20:49.250,00:20:53.666,Remember that time?
00:20:53.750,00:20:56.125,"Doesn't matter when it's Arcturian, baby."
00:20:56.541,00:20:59.166,"Hey, Bishop, man."
00:20:59.250,00:21:01.541,"Oh, come on. Yeah."
00:21:01.666,00:21:03.500,All right! Yeah.
00:21:03.625,00:21:05.333,"I don't want to see that, man."
00:21:05.416,00:21:07.166,"Come on, man."
00:21:08.083,00:21:10.250,"Hey, what are you doing, man?"
00:21:10.333,00:21:12.500,Come on.
00:21:12.625,00:21:15.083,"Bishop, hey, man."
00:21:15.166,00:21:18.750,"Hey! Not me, man! Hey, come on. Quit messing around!"
00:21:18.875,00:21:20.208,Trust me.
00:21:34.166,00:21:35.875,APONE: All right.
00:21:36.000,00:21:38.208,Thank you.
00:21:40.291,00:21:42.500,"There you go, short shit."
00:21:42.958,00:21:44.666,"That wasn't funny, man."
00:21:48.791,00:21:51.708,Lieutenant Gorman?
00:21:52.708,00:21:56.125,Looks like the new lieutenant's too good to eat with the rest of us grunts.
00:21:58.750,00:22:01.541,Boy's definitely got a corncob up his ass.
00:22:03.333,00:22:05.875,"BURKE: Thought you never miss, Bishop."
00:22:08.875,00:22:11.708,You never said anything about an android being on board.
00:22:12.791,00:22:15.500,Never occurred to me.
00:22:15.916,00:22:18.916,It's just common practice.
00:22:19.166,00:22:21.541,I prefer the term artificial person myself.
00:22:21.916,00:22:23.375,Right.
00:22:23.541,00:22:26.250,Is there a problem?
00:22:26.375,00:22:28.291,I don't know why I didn't even...
00:22:28.416,00:22:30.000,"Ripley's last trip out, the syn..."
00:22:30.083,00:22:31.833,The artificial person malfunctioned.
00:22:31.916,00:22:36.416,Malfunctioned?
00:22:37.041,00:22:39.875,I'm shocked.
00:22:40.083,00:22:42.666,Yeah.
00:22:42.791,00:22:45.583,"Well, that explains it then."
00:22:45.666,00:22:48.375,That could never happen now with our behavioral inhibitors.
00:22:48.458,00:22:52.916,"It is impossible for me to harm, or by omission of action, allow to be harmed, a human being."
00:22:54.125,00:22:56.625,You sure you don't want some?
00:22:57.500,00:22:59.833,"You just stay away from me, Bishop. You got that straight?"
00:23:03.291,00:23:05.458,"Guess she don't like the corn bread, either."
00:23:19.458,00:23:23.291,"APONE: Squad, ten-hut!"
00:23:23.625,00:23:26.375,"Quickly, quickly."
00:23:26.500,00:23:28.458,All right. Listen up!
00:23:29.500,00:23:32.958,"Morning, Marines."
00:23:29.500,00:23:34.625,"I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief you people before we left Gateway, but..."
00:23:34.708,00:23:37.125,HUDSON: Sir?
00:23:37.708,00:23:40.333,"Hudson, sir."
00:23:42.000,00:23:43.208,What's the question?
00:23:43.666,00:23:47.166,"Is this gonna be a stand-up fight, sir, or another bug hunt?"
00:23:48.708,00:23:51.458,All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony...
00:23:51.583,00:23:54.208,And that a Xenomorph may be involved.
00:23:54.416,00:23:57.375,"Excuse me, sir. A what?"
00:23:57.500,00:23:58.875,It's a bug hunt.
00:23:59.583,00:24:01.250,What exactly are we dealing with here?
00:24:01.958,00:24:03.375,Ripley?
00:24:04.375,00:24:06.791,I'll tell you what I know.
00:24:06.916,00:24:09.041,We set down on LV-426.
00:24:09.666,00:24:16.166,"One of our crew members was brought back on board with something attached to his face, some kind of parasite."
00:24:16.250,00:24:18.333,We tried to get it off.
00:24:18.666,00:24:21.416,"Later, it seemed to come off by itself and die."
00:24:21.791,00:24:23.708,Kane seemed fine.
00:24:24.041,00:24:26.375,"We were all having dinner, and, um..."
00:24:26.500,00:24:30.416,"It must have laid something inside his throat, some sort of embryo."
00:24:30.541,00:24:34.500,"He started... Um, he..."
00:24:34.708,00:24:37.791,I only need to know one thing...
00:24:38.041,00:24:39.750,Where they are.
00:24:39.875,00:24:42.625,"Yo, Vasquez. Kick ass."
00:24:42.750,00:24:47.541,"Right, right. Somebody said alien. She thought they said illegal alien and signed up."
00:24:47.708,00:24:49.750,"Fuck you, man."
00:24:49.875,00:24:51.208,Are you finished?
00:24:57.458,00:25:00.166,I hope you're right.
00:25:02.375,00:25:05.083,"Yeah, okay, right."
00:25:05.708,00:25:08.583,We also have Ripley's report on disk.
00:25:08.708,00:25:13.416,Because just one of those things managed to wipe out my entire crew in less than 24 hours.
00:25:13.666,00:25:18.041,"And if the colonists have found that ship, then there's no telling how many of them have been exposed."
00:25:18.125,00:25:19.875,Do you understand?
00:25:23.166,00:25:25.500,"Anyway, we have it on disk, so you better look at it."
00:25:26.291,00:25:27.958,Any questions?
00:25:29.416,00:25:30.750,"What is it, Private?"
00:25:31.458,00:25:33.833,How do I get out of this chickenshit outfit?
00:25:34.000,00:25:35.625,"You secure that shit, Hudson."
00:25:38.458,00:25:39.791,All right.
00:25:40.708,00:25:42.000,Now listen up.
00:25:44.875,00:25:46.916,I want this thing to go smooth...
00:25:47.000,00:25:48.750,And by the numbers.
00:25:49.625,00:25:53.958,I want D.C.S.
00:25:54.083,00:25:59.625,"Ordinance loading, weapons strip and drop-ship prep details will have seven hours."
00:25:59.708,00:26:01.333,"Now, move it, people!"
00:26:01.916,00:26:04.833,"All right, sweethearts."
00:26:04.958,00:26:08.708,Assholes and elbows!
00:26:24.166,00:26:26.125,"I don't care if you are short, Hudson."
00:26:26.208,00:26:28.625,"Hey, Sarge."
00:26:28.708,00:26:31.625,"Corporal, I want this loading lock sealed. Now!"
00:26:32.666,00:26:34.583,"How many more you got, Spunkmeyer?"
00:26:34.666,00:26:36.583,Good. Take it away.
00:26:54.125,00:26:56.041,Clear behind.
00:27:02.458,00:27:05.041,Did you check number three?
00:27:05.125,00:27:09.041,Hi. I feel like kind of a fifth wheel around here.
00:27:09.291,00:27:11.416,I don't know.
00:27:14.541,00:27:16.208,"Well, I can drive that loader."
00:27:17.708,00:27:19.708,I have a class 2 rating.
00:27:21.041,00:27:22.583,Be my guest.
00:28:08.416,00:28:09.625,Where you want it?
00:28:11.833,00:28:15.375,"Bay 12, please."
00:29:11.958,00:29:15.166,"APONE: All right, sweethearts. We're a team, and there's nothing to worry about."
00:29:15.791,00:29:19.208,"We come here, and we gonna conquer, and we gonna kick some."
00:29:19.333,00:29:20.708,Is that understood?
00:29:20.833,00:29:22.166,"That's what we gonna do, sweethearts."
00:29:22.291,00:29:24.500,We are going to go and get some.
00:29:24.625,00:29:27.291,"All right, people!"
00:29:27.375,00:29:30.166,Are you lean? Are you mean?
00:29:30.291,00:29:32.875,What are you? What are you?
00:29:33.083,00:29:35.541,"Hudson! Get on the ready line, Marine!"
00:29:35.833,00:29:38.916,Get some today!
00:29:39.041,00:29:41.875,Yo!
00:29:42.041,00:29:45.583,"Get hot! One, two, three!"
00:29:45.708,00:29:49.208,"Move it out, move it out, move it out! Move it out, move it out, move it out!"
00:29:52.041,00:29:55.666,Absolutely badasses.
00:29:55.750,00:29:57.958,Let's pack 'em in.
00:29:58.833,00:30:00.333,All right! Move it!
00:30:00.416,00:30:03.041,"Let's go, let's go!"
00:30:00.416,00:30:05.500,"One, two, three, four, five, six!"
00:30:06.541,00:30:10.000,All right.
00:30:10.875,00:30:13.000,Get those weapons stowed.
00:30:13.375,00:30:15.708,"Come on. Settle down, people."
00:30:18.000,00:30:19.791,"Lock 'em in, Hudson."
00:30:19.875,00:30:22.291,Ready to get it on?
00:30:23.041,00:30:25.083,"Okay, Bishop, let's go."
00:30:25.708,00:30:26.875,Roger.
00:30:29.625,00:30:31.083,"I'm ready, man."
00:30:31.875,00:30:35.416,Ready to get it on! Go!
00:30:39.458,00:30:43.458,Stand by. Cross-locking now.
00:30:47.250,00:30:50.291,Primary couplers released.
00:31:02.541,00:31:05.791,"Shit, man."
00:31:05.916,00:31:09.291,GORMAN: Affirmative.
00:31:13.125,00:31:14.458,Stand by. Ten seconds.
00:31:18.291,00:31:22.166,Stand by to initiate release sequencer...
00:31:23.166,00:31:26.958,"Five, four, three."
00:31:27.083,00:31:30.083,"Two, one, mark."
00:31:31.250,00:31:34.208,Woo-hoo!
00:31:46.333,00:31:48.416,Switch to D.C.S. Ranging.
00:31:48.500,00:31:50.500,"SPUNKMEYER: 240, nominal to profile."
00:31:50.583,00:31:52.833,"We're in the pipe, five by five."
00:32:03.750,00:32:06.041,We're picking up some hull ionization.
00:32:06.166,00:32:08.458,Got it. Rough air ahead.
00:32:08.541,00:32:10.708,We're in for some chop.
00:32:24.541,00:32:26.791,"How many drops is this for you, Lieutenant?"
00:32:29.208,00:32:30.750,Thirty-eight.
00:32:32.125,00:32:33.541,Simulated.
00:32:33.875,00:32:35.708,How many combat drops?
00:32:36.083,00:32:39.833,"Uh, two... Including this one."
00:32:41.000,00:32:43.208,Shit.
00:32:56.416,00:33:00.208,Range 014. Turning on final.
00:33:05.541,00:33:07.875,"FROST: And I'm telling you, I got a bad feeling about this drop."
00:33:08.041,00:33:09.583,"CROWE: You always say that, Frost."
00:33:09.708,00:33:11.750,"You always say, I got a bad feeling about this drop."
00:33:11.875,00:33:14.458,"FROST: Okay, okay."
00:33:11.875,00:33:17.708,"When we get back without you, I'll call your folks."
00:33:19.416,00:33:23.166,All right.
00:33:23.541,00:33:27.000,Everybody online.
00:33:28.916,00:33:32.333,"Drake, check your camera."
00:33:33.000,00:33:35.791,That's better.
00:33:36.208,00:33:37.791,Good.
00:33:38.541,00:33:39.791,"All right, gear up."
00:33:40.125,00:33:42.958,"Two minutes, people."
00:33:43.791,00:33:45.416,Somebody wake up Hicks.
00:33:59.208,00:34:01.125,Coming around for a 709er.
00:34:01.708,00:34:03.250,Terminal guidance locked in.
00:34:03.333,00:34:04.458,Where's the damn beacon?
00:34:05.583,00:34:06.791,"Oh, I see it."
00:34:13.333,00:34:16.458,That's the atmosphere processor?
00:34:17.125,00:34:19.791,Remarkable piece of machinery.
00:34:20.125,00:34:22.333,"You know, we manufacture those, by the way."
00:34:32.833,00:34:37.291,"GORMAN: Okay, Ferro."
00:34:39.333,00:34:41.333,Storm shutters are sealed.
00:34:41.458,00:34:45.000,There's no visible activity.
00:34:45.208,00:34:48.000,Give me a slow circle of the complex.
00:34:56.041,00:34:57.500,Structure seems intact.
00:34:59.333,00:35:00.666,They still have power.
00:35:00.791,00:35:04.291,"Okay, Ferro. Set down on the landing grid."
00:35:04.875,00:35:07.541,"Immediate dust off on my clear, then stay on station."
00:35:21.541,00:35:23.291,FERRO: Down and clear.
00:35:25.583,00:35:27.208,"Ten seconds, people."
00:35:30.541,00:35:33.333,"All right. I want a nice, clean dispersal this time."
00:35:35.708,00:35:37.333,Let's go! Move it out!
00:35:38.250,00:35:39.791,Head 'em up!
00:36:00.958,00:36:04.583,First squad up on line.
00:36:05.166,00:36:07.583,"Vasquez, take point."
00:36:15.916,00:36:17.166,Move up.
00:36:21.000,00:36:22.666,"Hudson, run a bypass."
00:36:28.500,00:36:30.791,"Second squad, move up."
00:36:31.208,00:36:32.666,Second squad on line.
00:37:07.000,00:37:08.250,Go on.
00:37:34.458,00:37:37.000,"Second team, move inside."
00:38:05.666,00:38:09.958,"APONE: Sir, you copying this?"
00:38:10.458,00:38:12.708,"Uh, we got some explosives damage."
00:38:12.791,00:38:15.541,It's probably seismic survey charges.
00:38:15.875,00:38:19.333,Are you reading this?
00:38:33.041,00:38:36.916,GORMAN: All right.
00:38:54.750,00:38:58.458,Nothing.
00:39:04.250,00:39:05.750,Quarter and search by twos.
00:39:17.916,00:39:19.750,"Okay. Dietrich, Frost, you're up."
00:39:58.666,00:40:01.000,"Wait. Wait, tell him to..."
00:40:02.125,00:40:05.125,"Hicks, back up. Pan right."
00:40:07.166,00:40:08.833,There.
00:40:10.000,00:40:12.041,You seeing this all right?
00:40:12.833,00:40:17.291,Looks melted.
00:40:18.750,00:40:20.250,Acid for blood.
00:40:20.416,00:40:23.750,"If you like that, you're gonna love this."
00:40:37.291,00:40:38.833,Quit screwing around.
00:40:38.958,00:40:40.875,"Second squad, what's your status?"
00:40:41.000,00:40:43.833,"HICKS: Uh, we just finished our sweep. Nobody's home."
00:40:43.958,00:40:46.500,"Roger. Sir, uh, this place is dead."
00:40:46.625,00:40:48.583,"Whatever happened here, I think we missed it."
00:40:49.208,00:40:51.875,The area's secured.
00:40:52.166,00:40:53.875,Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.
00:40:54.000,00:40:56.291,Wait a minute.
00:40:57.000,00:40:59.250,"First team, head for operations."
00:40:59.375,00:41:02.500,"Hudson, see if you can get their C.P.U. On line."
00:41:02.833,00:41:04.541,"Hicks, meet me at the south lock."
00:41:04.666,00:41:06.083,We're coming in.
00:41:06.666,00:41:09.500,He's comin' in.
00:41:09.583,00:41:11.541,Pendejo jerk-off.
00:41:23.166,00:41:30.208,"Sir, they sealed off this wing at both ends, welded the doors and blocked off the stairs with heavy equipment."
00:41:30.375,00:41:34.708,GORMAN: Mmm-hmm.
00:41:34.791,00:41:36.708,Any bodies?
00:41:37.208,00:41:38.708,Last stand.
00:41:38.916,00:41:41.083,DRAKE: Must have been a hell of a fight.
00:41:41.416,00:41:43.416,"Yeah, looks that way."
00:41:45.916,00:41:48.250,"GORMAN: All right, Drake, this way."
00:41:48.333,00:41:51.083,We should be able to cut through the medlab to operations.
00:42:43.041,00:42:45.000,HICKS: Lieutenant.
00:42:46.875,00:42:48.166,Gorman.
00:43:05.958,00:43:07.208,Are those the same ones that...
00:43:20.166,00:43:21.500,"Careful, Burke."
00:43:32.375,00:43:34.875,Looks like love at first sight to me.
00:43:36.500,00:43:38.791,"Oh, he likes you, Burke."
00:43:38.916,00:43:41.083,Two are alive.
00:43:43.208,00:43:46.041,Surgically removed before embryo implantation.
00:43:46.375,00:43:50.458,"Subject Marachek, John J., died during the procedure."
00:43:50.916,00:43:52.875,They killed him taking it off.
00:43:53.458,00:43:57.000,"Yo, Hicks."
00:43:58.166,00:44:00.125,I think we got something here.
00:44:05.375,00:44:06.875,Behind us.
00:44:08.416,00:44:11.708,"Apone, where are your people?"
00:44:11.791,00:44:14.708,"Ah, that's a negative."
00:44:17.833,00:44:19.416,"Talk to me, Frosty."
00:44:20.083,00:44:21.541,"Let's keep moving, baby."
00:44:40.333,00:44:42.083,It's moving.
00:44:42.500,00:44:45.583,It's coming straight for us.
00:45:23.333,00:45:25.375,Fuck!
00:45:27.125,00:45:28.208,Ripley.
00:45:48.125,00:45:51.000,Hey. Shh. It's all right.
00:45:51.125,00:45:53.333,It's all right. Come on.
00:45:53.458,00:45:56.500,Don't be afraid. Come on.
00:45:56.708,00:45:58.833,Shh. It's all right.
00:45:59.333,00:46:01.166,Come on out. Come on.
00:46:01.250,00:46:03.333,Easy. Easy.
00:46:03.458,00:46:05.166,Ow! Damn!
00:46:05.583,00:46:08.000,Watch her!
00:46:08.541,00:46:11.166,"Frost, get your light up here."
00:46:14.875,00:46:16.541,Shine the light.
00:46:18.333,00:46:20.000,Here. Here.
00:46:21.166,00:46:22.875,RIPLEY: Keep back.
00:46:23.166,00:46:25.625,"HICKS: Grab her, man."
00:46:28.291,00:46:29.750,HICKS: Kick it out!
00:46:31.166,00:46:33.750,Hey! Wait.
00:46:59.666,00:47:02.583,It's okay. It's all right.
00:47:04.083,00:47:05.500,Don't be afraid.
00:47:07.500,00:47:08.750,See?
00:47:09.875,00:47:11.541,"Wait. No, you don't."
00:47:12.166,00:47:15.500,It's okay. You're gonna be all right now.
00:47:15.583,00:47:17.083,Shh.
00:47:18.125,00:47:21.708,Easy. Easy.
00:47:21.791,00:47:23.916,It's all right.
00:47:24.000,00:47:26.250,"Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh."
00:47:26.333,00:47:29.416,Easy. Easy.
00:48:06.041,00:48:08.541,What's her name again?
00:48:08.625,00:48:11.291,"Now think, Rebecca."
00:48:12.416,00:48:14.625,Just start at the beginning.
00:48:15.333,00:48:17.166,Where are your parents?
00:48:18.375,00:48:20.000,"Now, look, Rebecca, you have to try and help..."
00:48:20.125,00:48:22.625,"Gorman, give it a rest, why don't you?"
00:48:25.583,00:48:27.958,Total brain lock.
00:48:28.541,00:48:30.583,"Physically, she's okay."
00:48:30.666,00:48:33.791,"Borderline malnutrition, but I don't think there's any permanent damage."
00:48:33.875,00:48:35.833,Come on.
00:48:45.791,00:48:47.250,Try this.
00:48:48.166,00:48:50.000,It's a little hot chocolate.
00:48:51.666,00:48:53.458,There you go.
00:48:54.291,00:48:55.750,Whoop.
00:48:56.833,00:48:58.500,"That good, huh?"
00:49:03.458,00:49:06.666,Uh-oh. I made a clean spot here.
00:49:06.791,00:49:10.000,Now I've done it.
00:49:20.333,00:49:23.208,Hard to believe there's a little girl under all this.
00:49:25.250,00:49:26.541,And a pretty one too.
00:49:32.625,00:49:34.125,"You don't talk much, do you?"
00:49:43.458,00:49:45.583,Smoking or nonsmoking?
00:49:45.666,00:49:47.541,"Just tell me what you're scanning for, Private."
00:49:47.666,00:49:49.208,P.D.T.'s.
00:49:49.375,00:49:51.250,Personal data transmitters.
00:49:51.375,00:49:53.750,Every colonist had one surgically implanted.
00:49:53.833,00:49:57.291,"If they're within 20 klicks, we'll read it out here."
00:49:57.416,00:49:59.250,"So far, zippo."
00:49:59.541,00:50:04.625,"Oh, I don't know how you managed to stay alive, but you're one brave kid, Rebecca."
00:50:11.000,00:50:14.458,What'd you say?
00:50:14.583,00:50:16.791,My name's Newt.
00:50:16.916,00:50:20.708,Nobody calls me Rebecca except my brother.
00:50:22.000,00:50:25.041,Newt? I like that.
00:50:25.833,00:50:29.083,I'm Ripley.
00:50:32.000,00:50:34.916,"And who is this, hmm?"
00:50:35.000,00:50:38.250,Casey.
00:50:39.875,00:50:41.500,What about your brother?
00:50:42.291,00:50:43.958,Timmy.
00:50:44.041,00:50:48.583,Is Timmy around here too?
00:50:51.625,00:50:52.958,Any sisters?
00:50:57.333,00:50:58.625,Mom and dad?
00:51:01.625,00:51:05.750,"Newt, look at me."
00:51:05.833,00:51:08.875,"They're dead, all right?"
00:51:12.291,00:51:13.833,"I'm sorry, Newt."
00:51:15.125,00:51:17.166,Don't you think you'd be safer here with us?
00:51:21.250,00:51:23.083,These people are here to protect you.
00:51:23.833,00:51:25.375,They're soldiers.
00:51:25.500,00:51:27.750,It won't make any difference.
00:51:42.125,00:51:43.833,Need anything else?
00:51:46.333,00:51:49.000,"Hello, Bishop. Do you need anything else?"
00:51:51.416,00:51:52.791,No.
00:51:55.666,00:51:57.208,"That's a nice pet you got there, Bishop."
00:51:57.541,00:51:59.083,"Magnificent, isn't it?"
00:52:00.583,00:52:05.250,Yo! Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!
00:52:05.416,00:52:07.833,They alive?
00:52:05.416,00:52:10.000,"Unknown, but it looks like all of them."
00:52:11.000,00:52:16.750,"Over at the processing station, sublevel 3, under the main cooling towers."
00:52:18.208,00:52:20.583,Looks like a goddamn town meeting.
00:52:21.041,00:52:22.833,"Let's saddle up, Apone."
00:52:22.916,00:52:24.500,"Aye, sir."
00:52:25.375,00:52:28.208,"All right. Let's go, people."
00:52:28.333,00:52:29.708,Let's go. Head 'em out!
00:52:29.791,00:52:31.583,"Okay, Frost, you're driving."
00:52:43.833,00:52:47.125,It's okay. Don't worry.
00:53:27.958,00:53:32.083,"a straight V deployment, second team on left flank."
00:53:32.166,00:53:35.958,Advance on Axial 664.
00:53:36.041,00:53:39.041,Set the V gain to filter RF. Ambient.
00:53:39.125,00:53:42.958,"APONE: Hudson, tracker on line."
00:53:44.291,00:53:47.833,"GORMAN: Forty meters in, bearing 221, there should be a stairwell."
00:53:48.791,00:53:50.500,Check. Got it.
00:53:52.291,00:53:54.291,GORMAN: You want sublevel 3.
00:53:56.291,00:53:58.625,"APONE: Let's go, people."
00:53:58.750,00:54:01.041,"Hicks, watch our tails."
00:54:01.166,00:54:04.166,Nice and easy.
00:54:05.166,00:54:06.833,Check those corners.
00:54:10.166,00:54:12.458,Watch your spacing.
00:54:12.541,00:54:14.416,Don't bunch up. Stay loose.
00:54:14.833,00:54:17.916,"GORMAN: Uh, your transmission's showing a lot of breakup."
00:54:18.375,00:54:21.125,HUDSON: Probably getting some interference from the structure.
00:54:21.208,00:54:22.583,APONE: Use those lights.
00:54:24.208,00:54:28.250,"GORMAN: Next one down, and proceed on a 216."
00:54:28.625,00:54:30.333,"APONE: Uh, roger."
00:54:33.083,00:54:36.250,GORMAN: I'm not making that out too well.
00:54:36.375,00:54:38.666,"You tell me, man."
00:54:54.375,00:54:55.625,What is that?
00:54:57.125,00:54:58.250,I don't know.
00:54:59.958,00:55:01.208,Proceed inside.
00:55:18.416,00:55:21.208,Watch your fire and check your targets.
00:55:21.333,00:55:23.500,"Remember, we're looking for civvies in here."
00:55:33.708,00:55:35.416,APONE: Easy.
00:55:35.541,00:55:38.541,"HICKS: Tighten it up, Frost."
00:55:39.500,00:55:41.583,APONE: Nice and easy.
00:55:44.291,00:55:45.916,Looks like some sort of secreted resin.
00:55:46.041,00:55:49.791,"Yeah, but secreted from what?"
00:55:50.208,00:55:52.250,Nobody touch nothing.
00:55:53.333,00:55:55.250,"Busy little creatures, huh?"
00:55:56.416,00:55:57.916,Hot as hell in here.
00:55:58.375,00:56:00.250,"Yeah, man, but it's a dry heat."
00:56:00.333,00:56:01.791,"APONE: Knock it off, Hudson."
00:56:10.375,00:56:13.458,"Lieutenant, what do those pulse rifles fire?"
00:56:13.583,00:56:15.750,Ten millimeter explosive-tip caseless.
00:56:16.125,00:56:17.791,Standard light armor-piercing round.
00:56:17.875,00:56:20.083,Why?
00:56:20.166,00:56:23.125,They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
00:56:23.291,00:56:24.458,So?
00:56:25.708,00:56:29.625,"So if they fire their weapons in there, won't they rupture the cooling system?"
00:56:29.750,00:56:33.625,"Ho, ho, ho. Yeah."
00:56:34.333,00:56:37.958,Look. This whole station is basically a big fusion reactor.
00:56:39.083,00:56:40.333,Right?
00:56:40.833,00:56:45.166,"So you're talking about a thermonuclear explosion, and adios, muchachos."
00:56:45.500,00:56:47.791,"Oh, great. Wonderful."
00:56:49.125,00:56:50.666,Shit!
00:56:53.208,00:56:57.833,Look. Uh... Apone.
00:56:58.125,00:57:01.541,Look. We can't have any firing in there.
00:57:01.666,00:57:05.125,"I, uh... I want you to collect magazines from everybody."
00:57:05.208,00:57:06.833,Is he fuckin' crazy?
00:57:07.041,00:57:09.291,"What the hell are we supposed to use, man, harsh language?"
00:57:09.375,00:57:12.333,GORMAN: Flame units only.
00:57:12.416,00:57:15.208,"Just do it, Sergeant."
00:57:16.958,00:57:19.541,"All right, sweethearts."
00:57:19.666,00:57:21.041,Come on. Let's have 'em.
00:57:22.375,00:57:24.458,"Come on, Vasquez."
00:57:28.000,00:57:29.458,Damn!
00:57:30.208,00:57:32.375,"You too. Give it up, Ski."
00:57:32.500,00:57:35.208,"Crowe, I want it now."
00:57:35.375,00:57:37.041,"Right on, Vas."
00:57:38.875,00:57:40.708,"Let's go, Marine. Give it up."
00:57:40.833,00:57:42.583,"Frost, you got the duty."
00:57:43.250,00:57:45.541,"Thanks a lot, Sarge."
00:57:45.625,00:57:47.083,"Head 'em out, people."
00:57:49.875,00:57:53.500,I like to keep this handy...
00:57:53.583,00:57:55.250,I heard that.
00:58:04.500,00:58:06.250,GORMAN: Any movement?
00:58:06.333,00:58:08.833,Nothing. Zip.
00:58:22.000,00:58:24.000,Holy shit.
00:58:37.083,00:58:39.291,"RIPLEY: Newt, go sit up front."
00:58:40.083,00:58:41.791,Go on! Now!
00:59:10.833,00:59:13.291,"APONE: Steady, people."
00:59:14.125,00:59:16.791,"We're still Marines, and we got a job to do."
00:59:16.875,00:59:20.500,Keep it moving. Easy.
00:59:52.666,00:59:54.125,Help!
00:59:54.416,00:59:55.958,"Top, get over here. We got a live one!"
00:59:56.333,00:59:57.833,You're gonna be all right.
00:59:57.916,01:00:00.375,Please... K... Kill me.
01:00:00.500,01:00:03.250,DIETRICH: Just stay calm.
01:00:03.333,01:00:06.041,It's gonna be all right.
01:00:06.166,01:00:08.416,"What is it, Dietrich?"
01:00:08.750,01:00:11.166,"Dietrich, get back!"
01:00:11.250,01:00:13.500,Get back!
01:00:20.791,01:00:21.916,No!
01:00:22.291,01:00:24.000,"APONE: Frost, flamethrower."
01:00:24.083,01:00:26.791,Get back!
01:00:56.833,01:00:58.208,Movement!
01:00:58.333,01:00:59.458,What's the position?
01:01:01.583,01:01:03.041,I can't lock in!
01:01:03.875,01:01:05.583,"Talk to me, Hudson!"
01:01:06.333,01:01:08.000,Multiple signals.
01:01:08.916,01:01:10.125,They're closing.
01:01:11.583,01:01:14.375,"Go to infrared, people."
01:01:14.958,01:01:18.083,"What's happening, Apone?"
01:01:18.416,01:01:19.708,"Pull your team out, Gorman."
01:01:25.833,01:01:28.416,I got signals. I got readings in front and behind.
01:01:28.916,01:01:30.916,"Where, man? I don't see shit."
01:01:31.083,01:01:33.250,He's right.
01:01:33.333,01:01:35.791,"Look, I'm telling you."
01:01:37.958,01:01:40.958,"Oh, shit."
01:01:41.375,01:01:44.041,"They're all around us, man! Jesus!"
01:01:44.708,01:01:46.916,Maybe they don't show up on infrared at all.
01:01:57.625,01:01:59.291,APONE: Frost!
01:02:04.500,01:02:06.208,Come on!
01:02:12.750,01:02:15.583,"Jesus Christ, Apone!"
01:02:15.666,01:02:17.583,HICKS: Wierzbowski and Crowe are down!
01:02:17.666,01:02:19.958,"Dietrich, Crowe!"
01:02:20.083,01:02:22.250,Sound off! Frost!
01:02:23.666,01:02:24.916,Frost!
01:02:26.583,01:02:29.208,Wierzbowski?
01:02:30.500,01:02:33.083,Wierzbowski?
01:02:39.833,01:02:41.041,Who's firing? God damn it!
01:02:42.166,01:02:43.333,Yeah!
01:02:43.708,01:02:45.333,I ordered to hold fire.
01:02:45.833,01:02:47.416,HUDSON: They're coming out of the walls!
01:02:47.500,01:02:49.541,They're coming out of the goddamn walls!
01:02:50.208,01:02:52.333,"VASQUEZ: On the right, man!"
01:02:50.208,01:02:55.041,"Uh, Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators..."
01:02:55.166,01:02:57.750,"Vasquez, Drake, hold your fire, God damn it!"
01:02:58.000,01:03:00.000,"GORMAN: Apone, are you copying me?"
01:03:00.125,01:03:01.833,I want you to lay down suppressing fire...
01:03:01.958,01:03:04.458,With the incinerators and fall back by squads to the A.P.C.
01:03:04.583,01:03:06.958,Over.
01:03:08.041,01:03:11.750,I said I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back...
01:03:11.875,01:03:14.375,By squads to the A.P.C. Over.
01:03:15.708,01:03:16.708,Hey!
01:03:19.000,01:03:21.041,HUDSON: Sarge! Sarge!
01:03:21.125,01:03:23.208,Talk to me. Apone?
01:03:23.333,01:03:25.541,"Talk to me, Apone."
01:03:27.708,01:03:29.375,Get them out of there!
01:03:29.458,01:03:32.791,"Do it now! Hicks, whoever's left, get..."
01:03:32.875,01:03:34.708,Just shut up!
01:03:35.083,01:03:38.250,"Oh, God! It's coming out of the goddamn walls!"
01:03:38.333,01:03:39.708,Where's Apone?
01:03:39.791,01:03:42.541,The Sarge is gone!
01:03:43.000,01:03:45.500,Let's move it!
01:03:45.916,01:03:48.333,Hudson? Vasquez?
01:03:49.000,01:03:51.500,"Hudson, look out!"
01:03:53.208,01:03:54.916,Watch it!
01:03:55.041,01:03:57.750,Hicks.
01:03:57.833,01:03:59.958,I told them to fall back.
01:04:00.083,01:04:01.041,They didn't fall back.
01:04:01.125,01:04:03.375,They're cut off!
01:04:03.458,01:04:05.458,Do something!
01:04:05.750,01:04:06.875,Fuck!
01:04:07.416,01:04:09.833,HUDSON: Come on.
01:04:16.916,01:04:18.958,"Ripley, what the hell are you doing?"
01:04:25.666,01:04:26.875,Turn around!
01:04:30.250,01:04:31.416,That's an order!
01:04:36.916,01:04:39.583,"Get off me, damn it!"
01:04:39.791,01:04:41.625,"You had your chance, Gorman."
01:04:54.041,01:04:55.333,Come on!
01:05:15.500,01:05:18.416,Come on. Let's move it!
01:05:18.500,01:05:20.250,VASQUEZ: Come on!
01:05:20.666,01:05:22.791,"HUDSON: It's blocked, man."
01:05:23.833,01:05:28.333,Open the door! Hicks!
01:05:29.000,01:05:30.791,"DRAKE: Get them, man!"
01:05:31.875,01:05:34.000,Run for it!
01:05:40.666,01:05:44.250,"VASQUEZ: Come on, man!"
01:05:51.958,01:05:53.208,"Drake, come on!"
01:05:58.708,01:06:00.458,No!
01:06:03.000,01:06:05.291,Fire in the hole!
01:06:05.375,01:06:07.166,Put it out! Put it out!
01:06:07.541,01:06:11.333,Come on. Put it out!
01:06:11.458,01:06:14.208,"Drake! No, he's not!"
01:06:16.208,01:06:18.041,Forget him! He's gone!
01:06:23.458,01:06:25.291,They're in the goddamn door!
01:06:28.875,01:06:30.333,Eat this!
01:06:31.583,01:06:34.666,HICKS: Ripley!
01:06:35.250,01:06:37.041,"Go, go, go!"
01:07:40.291,01:07:42.083,It's all right!
01:07:42.166,01:07:44.666,"Ripley, you've blown the transaxle!"
01:07:44.791,01:07:46.666,You're just grinding metal!
01:07:46.791,01:07:49.083,"Come on, ease down."
01:07:49.166,01:07:50.708,Ease down.
01:07:50.833,01:07:54.000,Ease down. Ease down.
01:08:06.750,01:08:08.708,You okay?
01:08:09.833,01:08:12.083,I'm all right.
01:08:12.166,01:08:14.666,"Get away from me, man!"
01:08:14.791,01:08:18.500,Lieutenant.
01:08:18.625,01:08:22.000,I don't know.
01:08:22.083,01:08:23.833,But he's alive.
01:08:24.000,01:08:26.125,"Wake up, pendejo, and then I'm gonna kill you!"
01:08:26.208,01:08:28.916,Back off. Right now.
01:08:31.958,01:08:34.250,Fuck!
01:08:34.333,01:08:37.000,"Hey. Hey, look."
01:08:37.666,01:08:40.875,"The Sarge and Dietrich aren't dead, man."
01:08:40.958,01:08:42.625,"Their signs are real low, but they ain't dead."
01:08:42.708,01:08:44.875,Then we go back in there and get them.
01:08:45.000,01:08:47.208,We don't leave our people behind...
01:08:47.291,01:08:48.375,You can't help them!
01:08:50.541,01:08:54.750,You can't. Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
01:08:59.125,01:09:03.708,"Oh, dear lord Jesus, this ain't happenin', man."
01:09:03.791,01:09:06.458,"This can't be happenin', man."
01:09:06.916,01:09:10.625,All right. We got seven canisters of CN-20.
01:09:10.750,01:09:13.958,I say we roll them in there and nerve gas the whole fucking nest.
01:09:14.083,01:09:16.875,"That's worth a try, but we don't even know if it's gonna affect them."
01:09:16.958,01:09:19.541,"Look, let's just bug out and call it even. Okay?"
01:09:19.708,01:09:21.208,What are we talking about this for?
01:09:21.291,01:09:24.666,I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.
01:09:28.125,01:09:29.583,It's the only way to be sure.
01:09:30.166,01:09:32.916,Fuckin' A!
01:09:33.000,01:09:37.000,This installation has a substantial dollar value attached to it.
01:09:37.250,01:09:38.541,They can bill me.
01:09:40.125,01:09:45.041,"Okay, look."
01:09:45.125,01:09:48.625,I know that.
01:09:48.750,01:09:51.750,This is clearly...
01:09:48.750,01:09:56.708,"Clearly an important species we're dealing with, and I don't think that you or I or anybody has the right to arbitrarily exterminate them."
01:09:56.791,01:09:57.791,Wrong.
01:09:57.916,01:09:59.000,Yeah. Watch us.
01:09:59.458,01:10:04.250,"Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got our asses kicked, pal!"
01:10:05.083,01:10:11.458,"Look. I'm not blind to what's going on, but I cannot authorize that kind of action."
01:10:13.916,01:10:16.166,"Well, I believe Corporal Hicks..."
01:10:17.166,01:10:18.541,Has authority here.
01:10:20.625,01:10:21.958,Corporal Hicks is...
01:10:22.083,01:10:26.500,"This operation is under military jurisdiction, and Hicks is next in chain of command."
01:10:26.625,01:10:27.791,"Am I right, Corporal?"
01:10:29.041,01:10:30.458,Yeah.
01:10:32.125,01:10:33.958,"Yeah, that's right."
01:10:34.708,01:10:37.000,"Yeah. Look, Ripley."
01:10:37.125,01:10:39.375,"This is a multimillion-dollar installation, okay?"
01:10:39.458,01:10:41.416,He can't make that kind of decision.
01:10:41.541,01:10:43.750,He's just a grunt.
01:10:43.833,01:10:47.958,None taken.
01:10:48.041,01:10:50.333,Prep for dust off.
01:10:50.458,01:10:52.333,FERRO: Roger. On our way.
01:10:52.458,01:10:55.500,"I say we take off, nuke the site from orbit."
01:10:55.833,01:10:57.083,It's the only way to be sure.
01:10:59.958,01:11:01.250,Let's do it.
01:11:09.000,01:11:12.291,"Let's go. Pick it up, Hudson."
01:11:17.708,01:11:19.625,All right.
01:11:26.208,01:11:28.125,"Move it, Spunkmeyer."
01:11:33.958,01:11:35.541,Hold on a second.
01:11:35.666,01:11:37.791,FERRO: Just get up here.
01:11:37.875,01:11:40.083,I'm in. Ramp closing.
01:12:00.625,01:12:01.916,Spunkmeyer.
01:12:03.166,01:12:06.875,God damn it.
01:12:07.291,01:12:08.875,"Well, where the fuck..."
01:12:21.875,01:12:22.958,Run!
01:13:05.166,01:13:08.708,"Well, that's great."
01:13:08.791,01:13:11.166,Now what the fuck are we supposed to do?
01:13:11.291,01:13:13.625,"We're in some real pretty shit now, man!"
01:13:13.708,01:13:15.333,Are you finished?
01:13:18.875,01:13:20.208,You all right?
01:13:25.875,01:13:28.833,"I guess we're not gonna be leaving now, right?"
01:13:30.333,01:13:31.833,"I'm sorry, Newt."
01:13:31.958,01:13:34.833,You don't have to be sorry.
01:13:34.958,01:13:38.416,"That's it, man."
01:13:38.500,01:13:41.166,What the fuck are we gonna do now?
01:13:41.291,01:13:45.583,Maybe we could build a fire.
01:13:45.666,01:13:51.375,"We'd better get back 'cause it'll be dark soon, and they mostly come at night, mostly."
01:14:08.916,01:14:10.416,"That's everything, right?"
01:14:11.041,01:14:12.875,All right. This is absolutely everything...
01:14:12.958,01:14:15.916,That we could salvage out of the A.P.C. Wreckage.
01:14:16.041,01:14:19.375,We got four pulse rifles with about 50 rounds each.
01:14:19.541,01:14:20.875,That ain't so good.
01:14:21.750,01:14:25.375,"We got, uh, 15 of these M-40 grenades."
01:14:25.583,01:14:26.916,Don't touch that.
01:14:27.625,01:14:29.916,"Dangerous, honey."
01:14:30.666,01:14:33.375,HICKS: Yeah.
01:14:34.125,01:14:37.375,"Got another one, it's damaged..."
01:14:38.791,01:14:41.916,How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
01:14:45.958,01:14:47.291,Seventeen days.
01:14:48.458,01:14:49.791,Seventeen days?
01:14:51.000,01:14:54.750,"Hey, man, I don't wanna rain on your parade, but we're not gonna last 17 hours."
01:14:55.333,01:14:57.416,Those things are gonna come in here just like they did before.
01:14:57.541,01:14:58.500,And they're gonna come in here...
01:14:58.583,01:15:01.750,Hudson! Hudson!
01:15:02.041,01:15:04.208,This little girl survived longer than that...
01:15:04.291,01:15:06.791,With no weapons and no training.
01:15:06.916,01:15:07.916,Right?
01:15:11.666,01:15:13.416,Why don't you put her in charge?
01:15:13.541,01:15:17.041,"You'd better just start dealing with it, Hudson. Listen to me."
01:15:17.125,01:15:19.166,"Hudson, just deal with it because we need you."
01:15:19.250,01:15:20.833,And I'm sick of your bullshit.
01:15:21.583,01:15:25.875,"Now, I want you to get on a terminal and call up some kind of floor plan file."
01:15:26.416,01:15:27.958,Construction blueprints.
01:15:28.083,01:15:30.208,Anything that shows the layout of this place.
01:15:30.500,01:15:33.125,Yeah.
01:15:33.458,01:15:39.458,"I need to see electrical access tunnels, subbasements, every possible way into this complex."
01:15:41.083,01:15:42.458,We don't have much time.
01:15:43.000,01:15:44.250,Okay.
01:15:45.583,01:15:47.541,"Okay, I'm on it."
01:15:47.958,01:15:49.333,Just relax.
01:15:55.875,01:16:00.375,I'll be in medlab.
01:16:00.791,01:16:03.666,Fine. You do that.
01:16:10.625,01:16:13.791,RIPLEY: So this service tunnel must be how they're moving back and forth.
01:16:13.875,01:16:18.500,HUDSON: That's right. It moves from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
01:16:21.125,01:16:23.500,Come down on that.
01:16:24.416,01:16:27.833,Hold. Go back.
01:16:33.333,01:16:35.000,No. It's back here.
01:16:37.041,01:16:39.416,"Well, there's a pressure door at this end."
01:16:39.625,01:16:41.750,"We could close that, weld it shut."
01:16:41.833,01:16:43.125,That should hold 'em for a while.
01:16:43.500,01:16:45.708,HUDSON: But we gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
01:16:45.833,01:16:50.458,"That's right, so we repair the barricades at these two intersections."
01:16:50.541,01:16:53.125,Right.
01:16:53.208,01:16:56.750,Here and here and here.
01:16:57.541,01:17:01.458,That should seal off medlab and operations.
01:17:02.125,01:17:03.666,Now all we need is a deck of cards.
01:17:06.333,01:17:08.041,"All right, people."
01:17:08.291,01:17:10.833,HUDSON: Affirmative.
01:17:13.458,01:17:16.708,We're sealing the tunnel.
01:17:29.208,01:17:30.666,For what it's worth.
01:17:33.083,01:17:35.208,Here. I want you to put this on.
01:17:36.708,01:17:38.875,What's it for?
01:17:39.041,01:17:40.916,Then I can find you anywhere in the complex on this.
01:17:44.250,01:17:45.708,It's just a precaution.
01:17:46.791,01:17:48.125,Thanks.
01:17:48.500,01:17:50.708,Doesn't mean we're engaged or anything.
01:17:51.833,01:17:53.208,"All right, what's next?"
01:18:10.416,01:18:11.833,Last stop.
01:18:16.666,01:18:18.458,Get in.
01:18:18.583,01:18:22.583,Scoot down. That's good.
01:18:22.791,01:18:26.375,"Now, you lie here and have a nap."
01:18:26.875,01:18:30.166,I don't want to.
01:18:32.708,01:18:35.625,"Well, I bet Casey doesn't have scary dreams."
01:18:35.750,01:18:37.791,Let's take a look.
01:18:37.875,01:18:40.125,Nope. Nothing bad in there.
01:18:40.250,01:18:44.625,"See? Maybe you could just try to be like her, hmm?"
01:18:44.708,01:18:50.125,"Ripley, she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic."
01:18:50.625,01:18:53.291,"Right. I'm sorry, Newt."
01:19:00.750,01:19:02.791,There.
01:19:02.916,01:19:05.958,My mommy always said there were no monsters...
01:19:06.041,01:19:08.458,No real ones...
01:19:10.541,01:19:12.333,"Yes, there are, aren't there?"
01:19:14.666,01:19:16.708,Why do they tell little kids that?
01:19:19.166,01:19:20.708,Most of the time it's true.
01:19:24.166,01:19:25.541,Here.
01:19:27.291,01:19:28.750,Take this.
01:19:29.833,01:19:31.333,For luck.
01:19:34.958,01:19:36.541,There's that.
01:19:39.500,01:19:41.166,"Don't go, please."
01:19:41.250,01:19:43.291,"Newt, I'm gonna be right in the next room."
01:19:44.875,01:19:46.750,And you see that camera right up there?
01:19:47.625,01:19:51.875,"I can see you right through that camera, all the time to see if you're safe."
01:19:56.708,01:19:58.625,"I'm not gonna leave you, Newt."
01:19:59.208,01:20:00.750,I mean that.
01:20:01.583,01:20:02.875,That's a promise.
01:20:03.250,01:20:04.666,You promise?
01:20:06.375,01:20:08.125,I cross my heart.
01:20:08.500,01:20:10.000,And hope to die?
01:20:11.333,01:20:12.583,And hope to die.
01:20:27.583,01:20:31.666,"Now go to sleep, and don't dream."
01:20:36.125,01:20:37.583,Sneak.
01:20:47.166,01:20:51.166,"The molecular acid oxidizes after the creature's death, completely neutralizing it."
01:20:51.250,01:20:54.583,"Bishop, you know, that's very interesting, but it doesn't really get us anywhere, does it?"
01:20:54.666,01:20:57.291,I'm trying to figure out what we're dealing with here.
01:20:57.416,01:20:59.500,Let's go through it again.
01:20:59.583,01:21:05.083,"They grab the colonists, they move them over there and they immobilize them to be hosts for more of these."
01:21:06.083,01:21:10.041,"Which would mean that there would have to be a lot of these parasites, right?"
01:21:10.125,01:21:12.291,One for each colonist.
01:21:12.458,01:21:14.000,Yes. That follows.
01:21:14.500,01:21:17.791,"But each one of these things comes from an egg, right?"
01:21:21.208,01:21:22.875,So who's laying these eggs?
01:21:24.125,01:21:25.625,I'm not sure.
01:21:26.458,01:21:28.125,It must be something we haven't seen yet.
01:21:32.750,01:21:36.000,"Bishop, I want these specimens destroyed as soon as you're finished with them."
01:21:36.125,01:21:37.125,Is that clear?
01:21:38.250,01:21:42.875,Mr. Burke gave instructions that they were to be kept alive in stasis for return to the company labs.
01:21:46.041,01:21:47.791,He was very specific about it.
01:21:48.833,01:21:52.625,"Look. Those two specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division, right?"
01:21:52.791,01:21:58.875,"Now, if you're smart, we can both come out of this heroes, and we will be set up for life."
01:22:00.500,01:22:02.500,"You're crazy, Burke."
01:22:03.250,01:22:07.375,Do you really think you can get a dangerous organism like that past I.C.C. quarantine?
01:22:07.500,01:22:10.166,How can they impound it if they don't know about it?
01:22:10.291,01:22:13.333,"But they will know about it, Burke, from me."
01:22:13.458,01:22:17.916,Just like they'll know that you were responsible for the deaths of 157 colonists.
01:22:18.000,01:22:20.333,Wait a second.
01:22:20.458,01:22:22.416,You're wrong.
01:22:22.500,01:22:26.541,"Directive dated 6-12-79, signed Burke, Carter J."
01:22:26.625,01:22:29.500,"You sent them out there, and you didn't even warn them."
01:22:29.625,01:22:31.916,"Why didn't you warn them, Burke?"
01:22:32.041,01:22:34.583,What if that ship didn't even exist?
01:22:34.708,01:22:42.041,"I didn't know. So now if I went and made a major security situation out of it, everybody steps in, administration steps in, and there's no exclusive rights for anybody."
01:22:42.166,01:22:46.166,Nobody wins.
01:22:46.250,01:22:49.083,"It was a bad call, Ripley."
01:22:49.208,01:22:50.375,Bad call?
01:22:50.500,01:22:52.125,"These people are dead, Burke!"
01:22:52.208,01:22:54.708,Don't you have any idea what you've done here?
01:22:54.833,01:22:57.708,"Well, I'm gonna make sure that they nail you right to the wall for this!"
01:22:57.833,01:23:00.041,You're not gonna sleaze your way out of this one.
01:23:00.125,01:23:01.750,Right to the wall.
01:23:04.250,01:23:07.083,Ripley. I...
01:23:07.375,01:23:09.416,"You know, I expected more from you."
01:23:09.500,01:23:12.041,I thought you'd be smarter than this.
01:23:13.333,01:23:15.250,"Well, I'm happy to disappoint you."
01:23:23.041,01:23:25.916,"It's very pretty, Bishop, but what are we looking for?"
01:23:26.000,01:23:29.416,That's it. Emergency venting.
01:23:29.500,01:23:34.250,"Oh, that's beautiful, man."
01:23:34.375,01:23:37.166,How long till it blows?
01:23:37.250,01:23:42.708,"With a blast radius of 30 kilometers, equal to about 40 megatons."
01:23:44.083,01:23:47.666,We got problems.
01:23:47.791,01:23:50.125,"Vasquez, close the shutters."
01:23:50.250,01:23:52.416,Why can't we shut it down from here?
01:23:52.541,01:23:54.458,I'm sorry. The crash caused too much damage.
01:23:54.583,01:23:57.000,An overload is inevitable at this point.
01:23:57.125,01:24:00.250,"Oh, man, and I was getting short."
01:24:00.333,01:24:03.625,Four more weeks and out.
01:24:03.708,01:24:05.458,"It ain't half fair, man."
01:24:05.625,01:24:08.291,HUDSON: Four more weeks.
01:24:08.416,01:24:11.625,"Oh, we've got to get the other drop ship from the Sulaco."
01:24:11.791,01:24:14.416,"I mean, there must be some way of bringing it down on remote."
01:24:14.625,01:24:18.041,How? The transmitter was on the A.P.C. It's wasted.
01:24:18.250,01:24:20.750,"Well, I don't care how, but we'd better think of something."
01:24:20.833,01:24:21.958,We'd better think of a way.
01:24:22.083,01:24:24.250,Think of what?
01:24:24.333,01:24:27.166,Shut up! What about the colony transmitters?
01:24:27.291,01:24:30.125,The uplink tower down at the other end.
01:24:30.208,01:24:33.458,"No, I checked."
01:24:33.541,01:24:34.958,We can't align the dish.
01:24:35.666,01:24:40.583,"Well, somebody's gonna have to go out there, take a portable terminal, go out there and patch in manually."
01:24:41.125,01:24:45.833,"Oh, yeah, sure. With those things running around?"
01:24:46.000,01:24:48.000,Yeah. I guess we can just count you out of everything.
01:24:48.125,01:24:49.916,"HUDSON: That's right, man."
01:24:50.000,01:24:51.708,BISHOP: I'll go.
01:24:51.833,01:24:53.541,I'll go.
01:24:53.666,01:24:56.041,"I mean, I'm the only one qualified to remote pilot the ship anyway."
01:24:56.708,01:25:00.333,"Yeah, right, man."
01:25:01.166,01:25:05.583,"Believe me, I'd prefer not to."
01:25:18.458,01:25:19.541,RIPLEY: How long?
01:25:19.666,01:25:23.125,This conduit runs almost to the uplink assembly...
01:25:23.250,01:25:26.333,Say 40 minutes to crawl down there...
01:25:27.291,01:25:30.375,An hour to patch in and align the antenna.
01:25:31.416,01:25:36.833,"Thirty minutes to prep the ship, and about 50 minutes flight time."
01:25:41.666,01:25:44.041,Good luck.
01:25:45.708,01:25:48.500,Watch your fingers.
01:25:51.750,01:25:52.875,"Vaya con dios, man."
01:26:06.416,01:26:08.500,I want you two walking perimeter.
01:26:09.583,01:26:10.916,"Hey, listen."
01:26:11.916,01:26:17.666,"We're all in strung-out shape, but stay frosty and alert."
01:26:19.750,01:26:22.208,We can't afford to let one of those bastards in here.
01:26:22.666,01:26:25.583,All right. Vamonos.
01:26:35.625,01:26:37.416,How long's it been since you got any sleep?
01:26:38.333,01:26:39.750,Twenty-four hours?
01:26:41.500,01:26:44.041,"Hicks, I'm not gonna end up like those others."
01:26:44.833,01:26:46.833,"You'll take care of it, won't you?"
01:26:49.375,01:26:53.375,"If it comes to that, I'll do us both."
01:26:55.500,01:26:57.791,"Listen, let's just make sure it doesn't come to that."
01:26:58.208,01:27:01.416,All right?
01:27:02.625,01:27:06.416,"Hey, I want to introduce you to a personal friend of mine."
01:27:07.291,01:27:14.875,"This is an M-41A pulse rifle, 10 millimeter, with an over-and-under 30 millimeter pump-action grenade launcher."
01:27:15.375,01:27:16.958,Feel the weight.
01:27:24.166,01:27:26.125,"Okay, what do I do?"
01:27:32.000,01:27:34.541,"Okay, pull it in tight here."
01:27:34.666,01:27:37.000,Uh-huh. Lean into it.
01:27:37.125,01:27:39.291,All right.
01:27:39.750,01:27:43.416,"All right. When the counter reads zero here, you..."
01:27:43.500,01:27:45.875,I press this up?
01:27:47.833,01:27:50.583,Get another one in quick.
01:27:51.500,01:27:53.833,Right.
01:27:54.250,01:27:57.208,What's this?
01:27:57.291,01:27:59.375,I don't think you want to mess with that.
01:27:59.833,01:28:02.583,You started this.
01:28:03.875,01:28:05.458,I can handle myself.
01:28:07.750,01:28:09.166,"Yeah, I noticed."
01:28:19.791,01:28:21.541,How do you feel?
01:28:21.666,01:28:25.000,"All right, I guess."
01:28:26.708,01:28:28.875,"Look, Ripley, I just want..."
01:28:29.041,01:28:30.375,Excuse me.
01:29:26.041,01:29:30.416,"Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh."
01:30:41.166,01:30:44.583,"Newt, wake up."
01:30:44.708,01:30:46.458,Wha...
01:30:46.541,01:30:48.416,We're in trouble.
01:31:06.541,01:31:07.916,No!
01:31:09.000,01:31:10.500,"Move, Newt!"
01:31:31.916,01:31:33.041,Hey!
01:31:42.833,01:31:46.583,Help! Help!
01:31:47.000,01:31:48.416,Hicks!
01:31:48.833,01:31:50.708,"HICKS: Say again, Bishop."
01:31:50.791,01:31:53.916,"You've got it into auto-refuel mode, and it's sequencing right?"
01:31:54.000,01:31:57.041,That's right.
01:31:57.125,01:32:00.458,Get back to me when you've activated the launch cycle.
01:32:00.583,01:32:01.750,Roger.
01:32:02.916,01:32:04.375,He's at the uplink tower.
01:32:04.458,01:32:06.458,Good.
01:32:08.958,01:32:11.500,RIPLEY: Hicks! Hicks! Hicks!
01:32:11.625,01:32:14.000,Help! Help!
01:32:14.250,01:32:17.791,Break the glass!
01:32:18.750,01:32:20.458,I'll try.
01:32:40.500,01:32:42.833,"Ripley, I'm scared."
01:32:44.000,01:32:45.458,Me too.
01:32:50.833,01:32:52.166,Stay here.
01:33:05.500,01:33:07.333,It's the medlab. Hudson!
01:33:07.958,01:33:10.625,"Vasquez, meet me in medlab."
01:33:10.708,01:33:12.750,We're on our way.
01:33:16.166,01:33:17.833,"They're coming, Newt."
01:33:50.708,01:33:52.458,Shoot it out!
01:33:56.833,01:33:58.375,Hudson!
01:34:02.208,01:34:03.791,"Christ, kid, look out!"
01:34:12.125,01:34:13.250,Fucking die.
01:34:25.208,01:34:28.250,Over there! Ready?
01:34:28.375,01:34:29.541,HICKS: Now!
01:34:33.500,01:34:35.666,Hudson?
01:34:35.750,01:34:38.041,Nailed the other one.
01:34:39.250,01:34:40.416,Jesus.
01:34:42.458,01:34:45.666,It was Burke.
01:34:48.416,01:34:51.416,I say we grease this rat-fuck son of a bitch right now.
01:34:51.583,01:34:54.375,Just doesn't make any goddamn sense.
01:34:57.583,01:35:01.541,He figured that he could get an alien back through quarantine...
01:35:01.625,01:35:04.416,If one of us was impregnated...
01:35:05.500,01:35:07.250,Whatever you call it...
01:35:07.958,01:35:10.166,And then frozen for the trip home.
01:35:11.375,01:35:14.583,Nobody would know about the embryos we were carrying...
01:35:15.583,01:35:16.833,Me and Newt.
01:35:19.083,01:35:20.666,"Wait a minute, now."
01:35:21.000,01:35:23.166,Yes. The only way he could do it...
01:35:23.291,01:35:26.666,Is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the way home.
01:35:26.791,01:35:27.875,Namely yours.
01:35:29.625,01:35:33.458,Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
01:35:33.583,01:35:38.166,Fuck! He's dead.
01:35:40.000,01:35:41.750,This is so nuts.
01:35:41.875,01:35:44.875,"I mean, listen..."
01:35:45.000,01:35:47.333,It's paranoid delusion.
01:35:47.416,01:35:51.500,It's really sad.
01:35:52.291,01:35:55.500,"You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse."
01:35:55.625,01:35:59.000,You don't see them fucking each other over for a goddamn percentage.
01:35:59.958,01:36:02.333,All right.
01:36:02.458,01:36:04.166,No! He's gotta go back...
01:36:06.083,01:36:08.750,They cut the power.
01:36:09.083,01:36:10.916,"How could they cut the power, man?"
01:36:11.000,01:36:13.416,"I want you two with trackers, checking the corridors! Move!"
01:36:13.500,01:36:15.041,"RIPLEY: Gorman, watch Burke!"
01:36:15.166,01:36:16.250,"Newt, stay close."
01:36:20.875,01:36:23.500,I'll go this side.
01:36:48.375,01:36:50.541,Anything?
01:36:50.958,01:36:53.833,It's inside the complex.
01:36:54.458,01:36:55.875,You're just reading me.
01:36:57.333,01:36:58.708,"No, no, it ain't you."
01:37:00.875,01:37:04.583,They're inside...
01:37:04.708,01:37:07.583,"RIPLEY: Hudson, stay cool! Vasquez?"
01:37:15.333,01:37:16.583,Hudson may be right.
01:37:17.416,01:37:19.750,"Get back, both of you!"
01:37:21.291,01:37:23.583,Must be some interference or something.
01:37:24.333,01:37:25.791,There's movement all over the place!
01:37:25.916,01:37:29.250,Get back to operations.
01:37:30.250,01:37:31.416,Newt.
01:37:33.250,01:37:36.291,Seal the door. Hurry!
01:37:36.416,01:37:39.250,Come on! Come on!
01:37:40.083,01:37:41.541,Work fast.
01:37:45.583,01:37:47.750,"Cover your eyes, Newt."
01:37:48.458,01:37:51.250,Movement. Signal's clean.
01:37:51.458,01:37:53.041,"Range, 20 meters."
01:37:53.291,01:37:55.458,"They found a way in, something we missed."
01:37:56.125,01:37:57.625,We didn't miss anything.
01:37:58.000,01:38:01.416,Eighteen. Seventeen meters.
01:38:01.500,01:38:04.583,"Something under the floor, not in the plans."
01:38:04.666,01:38:06.041,Fifteen meters.
