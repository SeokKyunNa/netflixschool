00:03:27.041,00:03:28.416,"Oh, crap!"
00:03:40.428,00:03:44.224,"Well, Nick the Dick!"
00:03:45.392,00:03:47.268,Fishing in Cuernavaca.
00:03:47.268,00:03:48.854,I'm sure you are.
00:03:48.854,00:03:51.190,"What do you say we take a look at your catch, huh?"
00:03:51.190,00:03:52.524,Come on.
00:03:59.823,00:04:02.159,"Oh, me, I would have thrown them back!"
00:04:08.040,00:04:11.001,"So, Nick, what do you get?"
00:04:11.001,00:04:15.172,"Hope you saved it all for your lawyer, my friend, because you are gonna need it."
00:04:19.676,00:04:21.136,We'll take it from here.
00:04:21.136,00:04:22.846,Who the hell are you?
00:04:22.846,00:04:24.472,"INS, Division Six."
00:04:24.472,00:04:27.142,JANUS: Division Six?
00:04:27.142,00:04:29.103,Really?
00:04:29.103,00:04:31.105,"Who you got your money on, Dee?"
00:04:31.105,00:04:32.355,"Tough call, Kay."
00:04:33.565,00:04:35.234,"What's up, how are you?"
00:04:35.234,00:04:36.944,"Good, good."
00:04:36.944,00:04:38.445,Okay.
00:04:38.445,00:04:40.030,"Grandma, don't worry."
00:04:40.030,00:04:43.033,Welcome to the United States.
00:04:43.033,00:04:45.702,"Where are you going, Nogales?"
00:04:45.702,00:04:47.871,Looking for work?
00:04:47.871,00:04:51.750,"And you, the same?"
00:04:51.750,00:04:53.668,Pleasure seeing you here.
00:04:53.668,00:04:55.587,And you?
00:04:55.587,00:04:59.091,What if I break your face?
00:05:01.384,00:05:05.305,"You're very ugly, no?"
00:05:05.305,00:05:08.892,"You don't speak a word of Spanish. Ha, ha."
00:05:08.892,00:05:10.435,"We got a winner here, Dee."
00:05:10.435,00:05:11.853,"Oh, I know!"
00:05:11.853,00:05:14.564,The rest of you can leave!
00:05:14.564,00:05:16.357,Don't move!
00:05:16.357,00:05:17.901,Get in the truck and leave.
00:05:17.901,00:05:19.945,"Sir! Sir, you can't just..."
00:05:19.945,00:05:21.822,"Don't sir me, young man."
00:05:21.822,00:05:24.032,You have no idea who you're dealing with.
00:05:25.742,00:05:29.788,Get in the truck right now!
00:05:29.788,00:05:32.582,We're gonna have a little chat with our friend here.
00:05:32.582,00:05:34.751,You fellows can hit the road.
00:05:34.751,00:05:37.879,Keep on protecting us from the dangerous aliens.
00:05:42.676,00:05:44.678,Did you ever hear of Division Six?
00:05:44.678,00:05:46.805,There is no Division Six.
00:05:46.805,00:05:47.973,This is bullshit.
00:05:47.973,00:05:50.642,"Hell, yeah."
00:05:50.642,00:05:54.062,"Looks like you fell off the bus in the wrong part of town, amigo."
00:05:54.062,00:05:57.983,"In fact, I'm gonna bet dollars to pesos you're not from anywhere near here."
00:06:00.902,00:06:02.112,Mikey?
00:06:09.410,00:06:11.370,"Mikey, when'd they let you out of jail?"
00:06:12.831,00:06:14.415,"Political refugee, right?"
00:06:14.415,00:06:16.918,You know how many treaties you just violated?
00:06:18.086,00:06:20.005,One?
00:06:22.549,00:06:24.926,"That's enough, Mikey."
00:06:29.973,00:06:32.100,Put up your arms and all your flippers.
00:06:43.653,00:06:44.946,"Ah, shit."
00:06:49.159,00:06:50.994,"KAY: Dee, shoot him!"
00:06:56.499,00:06:57.834,Dee!
00:07:21.149,00:07:23.318,That.
00:07:21.149,00:07:25.279,JANUS: That was...
00:07:25.279,00:07:26.947,"Was not human, I know."
00:07:26.947,00:07:29.866,"Oh, looks like you got some entrails on you there, pal."
00:07:29.866,00:07:31.534,What the hell?
00:07:31.534,00:07:34.121,The situation's under control.
00:07:34.121,00:07:38.166,"Give me your attention for a moment, and I'll be glad to tell you what happened."
00:07:46.174,00:07:48.509,This is called a neuralizer.
00:07:48.509,00:07:50.971,It's a gift from some friends from out-of-town.
00:07:50.971,00:07:56.768,"This red eye here will isolate the electronic impulses in your brains, and more specifically, the ones for memory."
00:07:56.768,00:08:00.230,"Well, that's good, fellows."
00:07:56.768,00:08:04.192,"Give me a splay burn around the perimeter with holes at forty, sixty and eighty meters from right here. Thank you!"
00:08:09.781,00:08:11.116,That's good!
00:08:11.116,00:08:12.533,What the hell is going on?
00:08:12.533,00:08:14.244,Excellent question.
00:08:14.244,00:08:17.205,And the answer you're looking for lies right here.
00:08:20.000,00:08:22.127,"Who are you, really?"
00:08:22.127,00:08:27.507,Really? I am just a figment of your imagination.
00:08:31.470,00:08:34.014,"Damn, what a gullible breed."
00:08:34.014,00:08:37.976,"KAY: I'm serious, fellows, you're lucky to be alive after a blast like that."
00:08:37.976,00:08:39.144,What blast?
00:08:39.144,00:08:41.438,"The underground gas vein, genius!"
00:08:41.438,00:08:43.690,You fellows need to exercise a lot more caution before discharging your firearms.
00:08:43.690,00:08:47.568,I'll tell you that right now!
00:08:47.568,00:08:52.407,And have yourself checked out with EMS on the other side of the hill before you leave.
00:09:03.126,00:09:04.794,I'm sorry about back there.
00:09:04.794,00:09:06.421,"Well, it happens."
00:09:06.421,00:09:07.797,Didn't used to.
00:09:10.175,00:09:15.347,"The spirit's willing, Kay, but the rest of me..."
00:09:18.350,00:09:19.851,"They're beautiful, aren't they?"
00:09:19.851,00:09:21.228,What?
00:09:21.228,00:09:22.562,The stars.
00:09:23.688,00:09:26.066,We never just look anymore.
00:09:26.066,00:09:27.775,No.
00:09:31.530,00:09:35.950,"I'll tell you, Kay, I will miss the chase."
00:09:41.498,00:09:44.543,"No, Dee, you won't."
00:09:46.545,00:09:48.255,Freeze!
00:09:48.255,00:09:49.923,NYPD! Freeze!
00:09:51.632,00:09:53.510,"All yours, Edwards!"
00:09:55.303,00:09:56.930,Freeze means stop!
00:09:57.889,00:09:59.724,Yo! Whoa!
00:10:03.270,00:10:04.604,What the hell?
00:10:06.898,00:10:08.775,All right!
00:10:08.775,00:10:09.901,Come on!
00:10:13.405,00:10:15.865,It just be raining black people in New York!
00:10:41.349,00:10:43.017,Do you see this? Huh?
00:10:43.017,00:10:45.353,N-Y-P-D!
00:10:45.353,00:10:48.022,Means I will knock your punk-ass down!
00:10:48.022,00:10:49.732,He's coming!
00:10:49.732,00:10:52.569,"Yeah, and when he gets here, I'll arrest his ass, too!"
00:10:56.490,00:10:58.617,"Oh, you trying to catch a beat down, huh?"
00:12:06.142,00:12:07.894,What's up?
00:12:07.894,00:12:09.145,No. He's coming.
00:12:11.022,00:12:13.732,He's coming because I failed.
00:12:13.732,00:12:16.695,"Yeah, well, you just pissing everybody off today, huh?"
00:12:17.736,00:12:19.698,You don't understand.
00:12:19.698,00:12:21.782,You world's gonna end!
00:12:24.994,00:12:26.621,What the hell are you?
00:12:30.791,00:12:34.003,"Hey, watch that ledge."
00:12:34.003,00:12:35.922,"Wait! Look, look."
00:12:35.922,00:12:38.508,"We'll get those eyes fixed, don't even worry about it."
00:12:38.508,00:12:42.512,"All right, look."
00:12:47.392,00:12:49.810,EDGAR: I go out.
00:12:49.810,00:12:56.443,"All I want is to come home to a nice clean house with a nice fat steak on the table, but, instead, I get this."
00:12:56.443,00:12:59.195,Don't you take that away!
00:12:59.195,00:13:00.905,"It is poison, isn't it?"
00:13:00.905,00:13:07.621,"I swear to God, I would not be surprised if it was, the way you skulk around here like a dog been hit too much or ain't been hit enough."
00:13:07.621,00:13:10.749,I can't make up my mind.
00:13:10.749,00:13:14.544,The only thing that pulls its weight around here is my God damn truck!
00:13:25.430,00:13:26.723,Figures.
00:13:35.649,00:13:37.233,"What the heck is it, Edgar?"
00:13:38.526,00:13:41.613,Get your big butt back in the house!
00:13:53.166,00:13:56.753,ALIEN: Place projectile weapon on the ground.
00:13:56.753,00:14:01.132,"You can have my gun when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers."
00:14:01.132,00:14:04.843,Your proposal is acceptable.
00:14:45.926,00:14:47.887,"Edgar, what on Earth was that?"
00:14:47.887,00:14:49.556,Sugar.
00:14:49.556,00:14:51.182,I've never seen sugar do that.
00:14:53.017,00:14:55.729,Give me sugar.
00:14:59.899,00:15:01.234,In water.
00:15:07.615,00:15:08.908,More.
00:15:12.245,00:15:13.663,More!
00:15:28.052,00:15:30.388,"Edgar, your skin is hanging off your bones."
00:15:36.770,00:15:38.104,"Oh, yeah!"
00:15:40.940,00:15:43.150,Ah. Is that better?
00:16:12.430,00:16:15.141,Perpetrator then blinked two sets of eyelids.
00:16:15.141,00:16:17.017,"You mean, blinked with both eyes?"
00:16:17.017,00:16:18.561,"No, sir."
00:16:17.017,00:16:20.814,"He blinked one set, then he blinked a completely different set."
00:16:20.814,00:16:22.982,"You know, like high beams and low beams."
00:16:24.317,00:16:30.281,Was that before or after he drew the weapon that you claim evaporated into a million pieces?
00:16:30.281,00:16:32.742,"After, sir."
00:16:32.742,00:16:36.788,And why is it that none of the other officers saw either of these two events?
00:16:36.788,00:16:40.040,"Sir, some of the other officers are a little soggy around the midsection."
00:16:40.040,00:16:42.752,I guess that's why they weren't able to keep up.
00:16:42.752,00:16:44.629,"Edwards, if you were half the man..."
00:16:44.629,00:16:47.047,What are you talking about?
00:16:47.047,00:16:49.216,"Hey, what is your problem?"
00:16:49.216,00:16:50.677,My problem is you being all up in my damn face!
00:16:50.677,00:16:51.761,"You know, I think he threw him off the roof!"
00:16:51.761,00:16:53.095,"Oh, really?"
00:16:53.095,00:16:54.764,"Sergeant, I wanna talk to you."
00:16:54.764,00:16:55.974,"Ten minutes, you take your best shot, tough guy!"
00:16:55.974,00:16:57.600,Outside. Now!
00:16:57.600,00:17:00.937,"Take ten minutes on a Stairmaster, you pudgy bastard."
00:17:06.359,00:17:09.195,"I believe you. Laurel Weaver, Deputy Medical Examiner."
00:17:09.195,00:17:11.614,Find me at the morgue on 26th.
00:17:11.614,00:17:14.116,Wait a minute.
00:17:14.116,00:17:16.285,KAY: Excuse me.
00:17:16.285,00:17:19.246,"You're Dr. Weaver with the coroner's office working on the John Doe, right?"
00:17:19.246,00:17:20.456,"Yes, that's right."
00:17:20.456,00:17:22.166,"Will you look at this, please?"
00:17:29.131,00:17:30.717,"Some night, huh?"
00:17:30.717,00:17:31.843,"Yeah, some night."
00:17:31.843,00:17:33.511,"They were gills, not eyelids."
00:17:35.095,00:17:36.931,Gills.
00:17:38.057,00:17:39.308,Who are you?
00:17:39.308,00:17:41.227,Did he say anything to you?
00:17:41.227,00:17:44.355,"Yeah, he said the world was coming to an end."
00:17:44.355,00:17:45.982,Did he say when?
00:17:51.696,00:17:54.866,Would you recognize that weapon of his if you saw it again?
00:17:54.866,00:17:56.158,Absolutely.
00:17:57.869,00:17:59.119,Come on.
00:17:59.119,00:18:00.997,"Wait, wait a minute."
00:18:00.997,00:18:02.331,"Look, I got tons of paperwork and..."
00:18:02.331,00:18:03.416,Right.
00:18:03.416,00:18:05.292,"Good work, Edwards."
00:18:05.292,00:18:08.212,You really ran this dude down on foot?
00:18:08.212,00:18:09.547,That's double tough.
00:18:19.766,00:18:24.395,"JAY: So, who exactly are you with? FBI? NSA?"
00:18:24.395,00:18:29.149,"KAY: I'm part of a bureau that licenses, monitors and polices alien activity on the planet Earth."
00:18:29.149,00:18:30.860,"Yeah, whatever."
00:18:30.860,00:18:32.152,We're here.
00:18:33.905,00:18:35.073,This is where we going?
00:18:35.073,00:18:36.365,Yeah.
00:18:36.365,00:18:38.200,This is Jack Jeebs' spot.
00:18:38.200,00:18:39.493,He buys from chains snatchers.
00:18:39.493,00:18:40.828,He doesn't even sell guns.
00:18:40.828,00:18:41.955,Really?
00:18:41.955,00:18:47.877,"All right, look, I'm gonna slide up in here and I'm gonna put my thing down, but when I come back out, I want some real answers."
00:18:47.877,00:18:49.420,"Okay, go put your thing down."
00:18:55.426,00:18:57.136,Officer Eduardo!
00:18:57.136,00:18:58.846,How did these get here?
00:18:58.846,00:19:00.056,I thought I turned these in to the proper authorities!
00:19:00.056,00:19:03.684,"Well, the way I hear it, Jeebs, you're into something a little hotter than some stolen Rolexes."
00:19:03.684,00:19:07.229,"Well, sure, I'm a huge crack dealer now, but I still work here 'cause I love the hours."
00:19:07.229,00:19:10.733,"I'm talking about guns, smart ass."
00:19:10.733,00:19:13.360,"Come on, Edwards."
00:19:15.863,00:19:17.490,"Why don't you show him the imports, Jeebs."
00:19:18.449,00:19:19.993,"Hey, Kay. How are you?"
00:19:19.993,00:19:21.786,Show him the imports right now.
00:19:21.786,00:19:23.830,"Yo, I got out of that business a long time ago."
00:19:23.830,00:19:25.915,"Why do you lie to me, Jeebs?"
00:19:25.915,00:19:27.125,"Now, just hold on a second."
00:19:27.125,00:19:28.375,I'm gonna count to three!
00:19:28.375,00:19:29.961,"He'll do it, Jeebs."
00:19:29.961,00:19:30.962,"I'm telling you, that man does not look stable."
00:19:30.962,00:19:33.006,...two...
00:19:33.006,00:19:34.841,"But, you know what?"
00:19:34.841,00:19:36.801,He's always crazy!
00:19:36.801,00:19:38.511,Take a cruise or...
00:19:38.511,00:19:40.013,Drop the weapon and put your hands on your head!
00:19:40.013,00:19:41.097,I warned him.
00:19:41.097,00:19:42.890,Drop the weapon!
00:19:42.890,00:19:44.058,Don't make me kill you!
00:19:44.058,00:19:46.978,JEEBS: You insensitive prick!
00:19:50.773,00:19:53.109,Do you have any idea how much that stings?
00:19:53.109,00:19:56.570,"Show us the merchandise or you're gonna lose another head, Jeebs."
00:20:08.457,00:20:10.084,Mr. Edwards?
00:20:14.881,00:20:17.341,Right there.
00:20:19.969,00:20:25.265,You sold a reverberating carbonizer with mutate capacity to an unlicensed cephalopod?
00:20:25.265,00:20:26.475,"Jeebs, you piece of..."
00:20:26.475,00:20:28.352,He looked all right to me.
00:20:28.352,00:20:30.270,It must have been for an assassination.
00:20:30.270,00:20:31.856,"You know, I don't know."
00:20:31.856,00:20:34.358,I don't know!
00:20:34.358,00:20:36.152,"All right, let's confiscate it."
00:20:36.152,00:20:40.322,And I want you on the next transport off this rock or I'm gonna shoot you where it don't grow back.
00:20:42.909,00:20:44.535,"Yeah, and..."
00:20:44.535,00:20:47.287,And I'm gonna be back to talk about them Rolexes.
00:21:10.352,00:21:12.479,Searching for a handle on the moment?
00:21:14.314,00:21:16.400,I can't help you.
00:21:16.400,00:21:22.364,The only comfort I can offer is my promise that tomorrow morning you won't remember a thing.
00:21:22.364,00:21:24.700,"Yeah, well, that's not exactly some shit you just forget."
00:21:24.700,00:21:26.493,"Have you ever seen one of these, son?"
00:21:30.039,00:21:32.541,So...
00:21:30.039,00:21:38.672,"So, she looks over to her husband, then she sets it back down in her lap and she says, Honey, this one's eating my popcorn!"
00:21:42.426,00:21:44.220,Did you get it?
00:21:44.220,00:21:46.931,This one's eating my...
00:21:46.931,00:21:50.059,"Oh, I got to go."
00:21:50.059,00:21:52.394,"Hey, wait, wait a minute."
00:21:52.394,00:21:53.687,You see what I mean about tequila?
00:21:53.687,00:21:57.566,"You're a very bright young man, James, but you need to lay off the sauce."
00:21:57.566,00:22:00.278,"I'll see you bright and early, 9:00."
00:22:00.278,00:22:02.780,Be there or be square.
00:22:24.468,00:22:29.515,"Well, well, well, moving right in, are we?"
00:22:29.515,00:22:31.851,"Yeah, I got a little eviction notice for you, boys."
00:22:31.851,00:22:35.021,Just what exactly do you think you're doing here?
00:22:35.021,00:22:37.148,I'm taking care of your pest problem.
00:22:37.148,00:22:39.483,Pest problem?
00:22:39.483,00:22:40.943,Pest?
00:22:40.943,00:22:43.154,Yeah. You got a hell of an infestation here.
00:22:43.154,00:22:45.739,"You know, I've noticed an infestation here."
00:22:45.739,00:22:47.241,"Everywhere I look, in fact."
00:22:47.241,00:22:59.461,"Nothing but undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious pond scum, totally convinced of their own superiority as they scurry about their short pointless lives."
00:22:59.461,00:23:01.964,"Well, yeah."
00:23:01.964,00:23:04.133,"Uh, don't you wanna get rid of them?"
00:23:04.133,00:23:05.759,"Oh, in the worst way."
00:23:41.461,00:23:43.256,Help you?
00:23:43.256,00:23:45.383,Yeah. This dude gave me this card the other day.
00:23:45.383,00:23:46.717,Elevator.
00:24:11.533,00:24:13.660,You're late.
00:24:20.751,00:24:22.669,My name is Zed.
00:24:22.669,00:24:25.463,You're all here because you're the best of the best.
00:24:25.463,00:24:30.510,"Marines, Air Force, Navy SEALs, Army Rangers, NYPD."
00:24:30.510,00:24:31.845,And we're looking for one of you.
00:24:31.845,00:24:33.389,Just one.
00:24:33.389,00:24:39.895,"What will follow is a series of simple tests for motor skills, concentration, stamina."
00:24:40.980,00:24:42.648,I see we have a question.
00:24:42.648,00:24:45.151,"Yeah, I'm sorry."
00:24:42.648,00:24:48.195,"Maybe you already answered this, but why exactly are we here?"
00:24:48.195,00:24:49.487,Son?
00:24:49.487,00:24:50.823,Second Lieutenant Jake Jensen.
00:24:50.823,00:24:53.284,West Point.
00:24:53.284,00:24:56.412,"We're here because you're looking for the best of the best of the best, sir!"
00:25:01.875,00:25:04.337,"What's so funny, Edwards?"
00:25:04.337,00:25:06.880,"Your boy, Captain America over here."
00:25:06.880,00:25:09.507,"The best of the best of the best, sir."
00:25:09.507,00:25:11.509,"Yeah, With honors."
00:25:11.509,00:25:15.431,"Yeah, he's just really excited and he has no clue why we're here."
00:25:15.431,00:25:17.641,That's just...
00:25:19.517,00:25:21.312,"Y'all ain't laughing, though."
00:25:28.861,00:25:30.988,"Okay, let's get going."
00:26:55.781,00:26:57.408,Wanna get down on this?
00:27:22.682,00:27:25.352,"ZED: Edwards, what the hell happened?"
00:27:25.352,00:27:26.686,Hesitated.
00:27:28.897,00:27:32.859,May I ask why you felt little Tiffany deserved to die?
00:27:32.859,00:27:35.446,"Well, she was the only one that actually seemed dangerous at the time, sir."
00:27:35.446,00:27:37.531,How'd you come to that conclusion?
00:27:37.531,00:27:41.827,"Well, first I was gonna pop this guy hanging from the street light and then I realized, you know, he's just working out."
00:27:41.827,00:27:45.956,"How would I feel if somebody come running in the gym, bust me in my ass while I'm on the treadmill?"
00:27:45.956,00:27:53.713,"Then I saw this snarling beast guy and I noticed he had a tissue in his hand, and I'm realizing, you know, he's not snarling, he's sneezing!"
00:27:53.713,00:27:55.048,"You know, ain't no real threat there."
00:27:55.048,00:27:56.634,Then I saw little Tiffany.
00:27:56.634,00:28:02.722,"I'm thinking, you know, eight year old white girl, middle of the ghetto, bunch of monsters, this time of night with quantum physics books."
00:28:02.722,00:28:04.808,"She about to start some shit, Zed."
00:28:04.808,00:28:07.811,She's about eight years old.
00:28:07.811,00:28:10.397,"If you ask me, I say she's up to something."
00:28:10.397,00:28:13.691,And to be honest I'd appreciate it if you eased up off my back about it.
00:28:17.404,00:28:19.490,Or do I owe her an apology?
00:28:26.955,00:28:28.915,"That was a good shot, though, right?"
00:28:33.962,00:28:36.089,He's got a real problem with authority.
00:28:36.089,00:28:37.675,So do I.
00:28:37.675,00:28:40.969,"But this kid ran down a cephalopod on foot, boss."
00:28:40.969,00:28:43.930,That's got to be tough enough.
00:28:43.930,00:28:46.099,Let's hope you know what you're doing.
00:28:54.692,00:28:56.943,"Gentlemen, congratulations."
00:28:56.943,00:29:00.780,You're everything we've come to expect from years of government training.
00:29:00.780,00:29:04.660,"And now, if you'll just follow me, we have one more test to administer."
00:29:04.660,00:29:05.994,An eye exam.
00:29:19.174,00:29:21.594,Where you going?
00:29:21.594,00:29:24.012,"Yo! Hey, man, what the hell is all this?"
00:29:24.012,00:29:31.437,"Back in the mid 1950s, the government started a little under-funded agency with the simple and laughable purpose of establishing contact with a race not of this planet."
00:29:31.437,00:29:34.856,"All right, gentlemen, if you'll look directly at the end of this device, we'll administer the eye test."
00:29:34.856,00:29:41.447,"Everybody thought the agency was a joke except the aliens who made contact March 2, 1961, outside New York."
00:29:41.447,00:29:43.657,There were nine of us the first night.
00:29:43.657,00:29:47.953,"Seven agents, one astronomer, and one dumb kid who got lost on the wrong back road."
00:29:47.953,00:29:51.624,"Oh, you brought that tall man some flowers."
00:29:51.624,00:29:53.833,This way.
00:29:53.833,00:29:56.336,They were a group of intergalactic refugees.
00:29:56.336,00:30:00.340,Wanted to use the Earth as an apolitical zone for creatures without a planet.
00:30:00.340,00:30:01.925,Did you ever see the movie Casablanca?
00:30:01.925,00:30:03.885,"The same thing, except no Nazis."
00:30:03.885,00:30:07.139,We agreed and we concealed all the evidence of their landing.
00:30:07.139,00:30:08.432,Uh-huh.
00:30:08.432,00:30:12.018,"So, these are real flying saucers and the World's Fair was just a cover-up for their landing?"
00:30:12.018,00:30:14.020,Why else would we hold it in Queens?
00:30:14.020,00:30:17.190,More non-humans arrive every year and they live among us in secret.
00:30:17.190,00:30:22.404,"Look, I'm sorry, but, not to change the subject or anything, but when was the last time you got a CAT scan?"
00:30:22.404,00:30:24.114,About six months ago.
00:30:24.114,00:30:26.575,"Right, you should make another appointment."
00:30:26.575,00:30:33.039,"Look, tell your boy Zed I had an absolutely wonderful time, and thank you for everything, but why don't you show me the door?"
00:30:34.958,00:30:36.251,I'm gonna get some coffee.
00:30:36.251,00:30:37.711,"No, thank you, I'm fine."
00:30:37.711,00:30:39.045,Okay.
00:30:43.383,00:30:45.177,"How you doing, fellows?"
00:30:45.177,00:30:47.012,"Hi, Kay!"
00:30:47.012,00:30:49.973,"That's not decaf, is it?"
00:30:49.973,00:30:52.601,Don't tell me we only got that powdered stuff for cream again.
00:30:52.601,00:30:53.686,I hate that stuff.
00:30:55.895,00:30:59.065,"Well, that's good."
00:30:59.065,00:31:00.693,KAY: You guys getting along all right?
00:31:02.152,00:31:04.029,"KAY: Well, don't work too hard."
00:31:05.864,00:31:07.825,"So, you guys seen the Cahuengas on that payroll?"
00:31:07.825,00:31:10.786,Sure you don't want some coffee?
00:31:10.786,00:31:13.789,"ALIEN: Cahuengas, yeah, but how about the zapoata?"
00:31:15.957,00:31:17.876,"KAY: All right kid, here's the deal."
00:31:17.876,00:31:21.171,"At any given time, there are around 1,500 aliens on the planet."
00:31:21.171,00:31:23.632,"Most of them, right here in Manhattan."
00:31:23.632,00:31:25.091,And most of them are decent enough.
00:31:25.091,00:31:26.844,They're just trying to make a living.
00:31:26.844,00:31:29.763,Cab drivers.
00:31:29.763,00:31:31.724,"Humans, for the most part, don't have a clue."
00:31:31.724,00:31:33.642,"They don't want one or need one, either."
00:31:33.642,00:31:38.480,They think they have a good bead on things.
00:31:38.480,00:31:41.024,But why the big secret?
00:31:41.024,00:31:42.860,A person is smart.
00:31:42.860,00:31:46.822,"People are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals and you know it."
00:31:46.822,00:31:52.077,"1,500 years ago, everybody knew the Earth was the center of the universe."
00:31:52.077,00:31:55.706,"500 years ago, everybody knew the Earth was flat."
00:31:55.706,00:32:00.627,"And 15 minutes ago, you knew that people were alone on this planet."
00:32:01.920,00:32:04.964,Imagine what you'll know tomorrow.
00:32:07.760,00:32:08.968,What's the catch?
00:32:08.968,00:32:10.554,The catch?
00:32:10.554,00:32:13.181,The catch is you will sever every human contact.
00:32:13.181,00:32:16.142,Nobody will ever know you exist anywhere.
00:32:18.186,00:32:19.646,Ever.
00:32:22.775,00:32:24.984,I'll give you to sunrise to think it over.
00:32:28.906,00:32:31.825,Hey! Is it worth it?
00:32:31.825,00:32:33.368,"Oh, yeah, it's worth it."
00:32:35.995,00:32:37.997,If you're strong enough.
00:33:37.307,00:33:38.892,"What's up, pops?"
00:33:48.861,00:33:51.279,"All right, I'm in."
00:33:51.279,00:33:54.032,"Because, look, there's some next level shit going on around here and I'm with that."
00:33:54.032,00:33:57.661,"But before y'all get to beaming me up, there's a couple things I want you to understand."
00:33:57.661,00:34:01.665,"First off, you chose me, so you recognize the skills."
00:34:01.665,00:34:05.168,And I don't want nobody calling me son or kid or sport or nothing like that.
00:34:05.168,00:34:07.128,Cool?
00:34:07.128,00:34:09.923,But I need to tell you something about all your skills.
00:34:11.758,00:34:16.095,"As of right now, they mean precisely dick."
00:34:20.141,00:34:22.435,Kay.
00:34:22.435,00:34:27.024,"WOMAN OVER PA: Due to asteroid turbulence, the 4:15 to Osiris will be delayed."
00:34:29.943,00:34:31.110,OFFICER: Purpose of trip?
00:34:31.110,00:34:32.571,ARQUILLIAN: Diplomatic mission.
00:34:32.571,00:34:33.864,Duration of stay?
00:34:33.864,00:34:35.156,Lunch.
00:34:35.156,00:34:37.617,Any fruits or vegetables?
00:34:37.617,00:34:40.746,WOMAN OVER PA: The transport from Xenderfloip has docked.
00:34:43.248,00:34:46.459,Please meet your party outside the detainment area.
00:34:49.796,00:34:52.049,You wanna stay away from that guy. He's...
00:34:53.174,00:34:55.176,He's grouchy.
00:34:55.176,00:34:59.932,A three hour delay in customs after a trip of seventeen trillion miles is gonna make anybody cranky.
00:34:59.932,00:35:02.017,"Hey, what branch of the government, do we report to?"
00:35:02.017,00:35:03.184,"Well, none."
00:35:03.184,00:35:05.604,"So, who pays for all this?"
00:35:05.604,00:35:08.982,We hold the patents on a few gadgets we confiscated from out-of-state visitors.
00:35:08.982,00:35:14.279,"Velcro, microwave ovens, liposuction. This is a fascinating little gadget."
00:35:14.279,00:35:18.283,It's gonna replace CDs soon.
00:35:18.283,00:35:20.285,That is a lot of fun.
00:35:20.285,00:35:22.704,We're not even supposed to have it and I'll tell you why.
00:35:22.704,00:35:28.251,"Human thought is so primitive, it's looked upon as an infectious disease in some of the better galaxies."
00:35:28.251,00:35:30.336,"That kind of makes you proud, doesn't it?"
00:35:30.336,00:35:32.464,"Hey, what's this thing?"
00:35:34.382,00:35:36.301,JAY: Okay!
00:35:36.301,00:35:42.724,Just be... Relax! Okay!
00:35:42.724,00:35:46.185,Look out...
00:35:51.357,00:35:55.361,"Oh, damn!"
00:36:06.873,00:36:10.794,This thing caused the 1977 New York blackout.
00:36:10.794,00:36:13.171,A practical joke by the Great Attracter.
00:36:13.171,00:36:16.091,He thought it was funny as hell.
00:36:16.091,00:36:20.679,"Sorry, y'all."
00:36:20.679,00:36:25.391,"Observation, the heart of our little endeavor. Meet the twins, Biblup and Bob."
00:36:25.391,00:36:29.146,This map shows the location of every registered alien on Earth at any given time.
00:36:29.146,00:36:31.564,Some of them under constant surveillance.
00:36:31.564,00:36:33.942,Everyone on those screens is an alien.
00:36:33.942,00:36:37.487,"In public, they're as normal as you are, but in private, well..."
00:36:37.487,00:36:39.614,You'll get the idea.
00:36:39.614,00:36:41.533,"Oh, man!"
00:36:41.533,00:36:44.243,"Doesn't make any sense, does it?"
00:36:44.243,00:36:47.413,"Well, no, it makes perfect sense!"
00:36:47.413,00:36:53.336,"When I was in third grade, everybody told me I was crazy, but I knew our teacher had to be from, like, Venus or something like that."
00:36:53.336,00:36:57.382,Ms. Edelson.
00:36:57.382,00:37:03.763,Revolve. Class be quiet and pay attention!
00:37:03.763,00:37:08.226,If I have to tell you one more time...
00:37:08.226,00:37:11.146,"Edwards, let's put it on!"
00:37:12.064,00:37:13.314,Put what on?
00:37:13.314,00:37:15.400,The last suit you'll ever wear.
00:37:28.205,00:37:33.793,ZED: You will dress only in attire specially sanctioned by MIB Special Services.
00:37:33.793,00:37:40.092,"You'll conform to the identity we give you, eat where we tell you, live where we tell you."
00:37:40.092,00:37:44.137,"From now on, you'll have no identifying marks of any kind."
00:37:44.137,00:37:46.765,You will not stand out in any way.
00:37:46.765,00:37:52.395,Your entire image is crafted to leave no lasting memory with anyone you encounter.
00:37:52.395,00:37:58.317,"You are a rumor, recognizable only as deja vu, and dismissed just as quickly."
00:37:58.317,00:38:02.864,You don't exist.
00:38:02.864,00:38:08.327,Anonymity is your name.
00:38:08.327,00:38:10.663,You are no longer part of the system.
00:38:10.663,00:38:12.540,You are above the system.
00:38:12.540,00:38:15.919,Over it. Beyond it.
00:38:15.919,00:38:18.922,We're them. We're they.
00:38:18.922,00:38:21.633,We are the Men in Black.
00:38:28.765,00:38:31.643,JAY: You know what the difference is between you and me?
00:38:34.271,00:38:35.730,I make this look good.
00:38:38.483,00:38:40.944,"ROSENBERG: We're gonna go for a little ride, you and me."
00:38:40.944,00:38:44.363,"I'll put you down here for just a minute, then Daddy'll be right back."
00:39:15.687,00:39:18.982,"Okay, now we're ready to go for a little ride."
00:39:18.982,00:39:22.694,And we're gonna meet one of Daddy's friends and you're gonna like him a lot.
00:39:25.738,00:39:28.283,"Okay, let's see."
00:39:28.283,00:39:35.414,"Bee, we've got the deposed sur-prefect of Sinalee touching down in the forest outside Portland tonight."
00:39:35.414,00:39:37.458,Humanoid?
00:39:37.458,00:39:41.546,You wish. Bring a sponge.
00:39:41.546,00:39:45.300,We had an unauthorized landing somewhere in upstate New York.
00:39:45.300,00:39:47.135,"Kay, keep your ears opened on this one."
00:39:47.135,00:39:50.680,We're not hosting an intergalactic kegger down here.
00:39:52.557,00:39:54.309,"Well, well, well, we got a skimmer!"
00:39:54.309,00:39:55.518,Landed alien out of zone.
00:39:55.518,00:39:56.519,Who is it?
00:39:56.519,00:39:58.855,ZED: Redgick.
00:39:58.855,00:40:03.235,"He's not cleared to leave Manhattan, but he's way out of town right now, stuck on the New Jersey Turnpike."
00:40:03.235,00:40:05.278,Why don't you take Junior here with you?
00:40:05.278,00:40:07.572,This is a good one for him to warm up on.
00:40:08.656,00:40:10.449,"Go get 'em, tiger."
00:40:15.705,00:40:19.334,We're not hosting an intergalactic kegger.
00:40:20.710,00:40:22.670,Zed.
00:40:22.670,00:40:25.506,He just...
00:40:25.506,00:40:30.762,Unlimited technology from the whole universe and we cruise around in a Ford P.O.S.
00:40:33.765,00:40:35.474,Fasten your seat belt.
00:40:35.474,00:40:37.936,"See, now we got to work on your people skills."
00:40:37.936,00:40:40.730,"You know, you'd get a much better reaction if you were a little more polite."
00:40:40.730,00:40:42.648,"Fasten your seat belt, please."
00:40:42.648,00:40:44.650,"Whoa, that was good."
00:40:48.196,00:40:50.240,"The red button there, kid, don't ever, ever touch the red button."
00:40:50.240,00:40:51.657,Ooh!
00:41:01.542,00:41:03.502,"All right, bub, that'll be $72 there."
00:41:03.502,00:41:05.380,"AUTOMATED VOICE: Please, remember to take all of your belongings..."
00:41:05.380,00:41:07.215,"Okay, sweetie, let me pay the impolite driver."
00:41:07.215,00:41:10.218,...when leaving this taxi and please get a receipt...
00:41:38.288,00:41:40.081,Sorry I'm late.
00:41:40.081,00:41:42.334,The cab drivers on this planet are terrible.
00:41:42.334,00:41:44.585,"Your Majesty, you are in grave danger."
00:41:44.585,00:41:48.173,"Yeah, and they overcharge you every time."
00:41:48.173,00:41:50.133,"Sir, a bug landed here."
00:41:50.133,00:41:52.802,We must get you off the planet.
00:41:52.802,00:41:55.347,A bug? He must know why I'm here.
00:41:55.347,00:41:57.974,We think he does.
00:41:57.974,00:41:59.809,Is that what I think it is?
00:41:59.809,00:42:01.686,"No, just some diamonds for your children."
00:42:01.686,00:42:04.356,Do we have time to eat?
00:42:04.356,00:42:06.483,Sure.
00:42:06.483,00:42:07.733,I ordered you some Pirogi.
00:42:07.733,00:42:10.278,Ah.
00:42:11.446,00:42:12.864,Six is up!
00:42:14.324,00:42:15.408,Where is Ivan?
00:42:15.408,00:42:17.576,EDGAR: Gave him a break!
00:42:27.920,00:42:31.632,To the continued reign of the Arquillian Empire.
00:42:31.632,00:42:33.343,To the safety of the Galaxy.
00:42:40.308,00:42:43.353,"You can kill us both, but you will not find the galaxy."
00:42:44.354,00:42:46.398,You're right about one thing!
00:42:59.577,00:43:00.786,"MAN 1: Hey, stop that guy!"
00:43:00.786,00:43:02.621,"You're not going anywhere, pal!"
00:43:06.209,00:43:07.793,"MAN 2: What's going on, man?"
00:43:09.962,00:43:12.465,"CHEF: Hey, hey, hey, easy!"
00:43:19.680,00:43:22.183,"Like to see your license and registration, please."
00:43:25.562,00:43:28.814,"Like to see your other license and registration, please."
00:43:35.572,00:43:38.533,"All right, your resident alien card has you restricted to the island of Manhattan."
00:43:38.533,00:43:39.951,"Where are you going, Redgie?"
00:43:39.951,00:43:43.121,"Well, it's my wife."
00:43:45.998,00:43:51.087,"Oh, All right."
00:43:51.087,00:43:52.505,It's all right.
00:43:53.548,00:43:55.800,"And, uh, and you handle this!"
00:43:55.800,00:43:57.469,What? Me?
00:43:57.469,00:43:58.803,"Yeah, it's easy."
00:43:58.803,00:44:00.096,Are you sure he knows what he's doing?
00:44:00.096,00:44:02.557,He does it all the time.
00:44:03.933,00:44:06.727,"Okay, yeah."
00:44:08.438,00:44:10.064,Oh!
00:44:10.064,00:44:14.110,"Kay! Damn, man! Some..."
00:44:14.110,00:44:16.070,"Croagg, the midwife's at 54th and Madison."
00:44:16.070,00:44:18.448,"You're headed out of town, Reggie."
00:44:18.448,00:44:19.782,"Well, we're meeting someone."
00:44:19.782,00:44:20.783,Who are you meeting?
00:44:20.783,00:44:22.619,"Well, it's a ship."
00:44:22.619,00:44:24.078,A ship? I didn't see a departure clearance for today.
00:44:24.078,00:44:25.246,You didn't?
00:44:25.246,00:44:26.623,"Well, it's an emergency."
00:44:26.623,00:44:28.040,What...
00:44:28.040,00:44:30.460,"You're doing fine, ace!"
00:44:30.460,00:44:33.212,What kind of emergency?
00:44:33.212,00:44:34.672,"Excuse me, miss!"
00:44:34.672,00:44:36.090,We just don't like the neighborhood anymore.
00:44:36.090,00:44:38.759,It's just some of the new arrivals.
00:44:38.759,00:44:41.720,What new arrivals?
00:44:41.720,00:44:43.181,Kay!
00:44:47.185,00:44:49.312,"JAY: Oh, man!"
00:44:49.312,00:44:50.896,"Oh, man!"
00:44:52.773,00:44:55.860,"Kay, look. Oh, man!"
00:44:57.736,00:45:01.824,"Congratulations, Redge, it's a squid."
00:45:01.824,00:45:03.742,"JAY: Kay, man!"
00:45:05.453,00:45:09.999,"You know, it's actually kind of..."
00:45:15.796,00:45:17.340,Cute.
00:45:24.681,00:45:29.394,Anything about that seem unusual to you?
00:45:29.394,00:45:34.106,What would scare Redgick so badly that he'd risk a warp jump with a newborn?
00:45:34.106,00:45:35.941,We'll check the hot sheets.
00:45:41.614,00:45:43.032,JAY: These are the hot sheets?
00:45:43.032,00:45:44.950,Best investigative reporting on the planet.
00:45:44.950,00:45:46.785,"Go ahead, read The New York Times if you want to."
00:45:46.785,00:45:48.871,They get lucky sometimes.
00:45:48.871,00:45:52.709,Cannot believe you're looking for tips in the supermarket tabloids.
00:45:54.168,00:45:55.836,Not looking for.
00:45:57.213,00:45:58.715,Found!
00:46:12.019,00:46:13.187,"Wait a minute, slow down."
00:46:13.187,00:46:14.606,Why?
00:46:14.606,00:46:15.856,Give her time to get the wrong impression.
00:46:15.856,00:46:18.067,It makes things go a lot smoother.
00:46:18.067,00:46:20.570,"Can I help you, gentlemen?"
00:46:20.570,00:46:23.989,"Yes, ma'am. I'm Special Agent Manheim, this is Special Agent Black, with the FBI."
00:46:23.989,00:46:25.950,We'd like to talk to you about your visitor.
00:46:25.950,00:46:28.160,"BEATRICE: You here to make fun of me, too?"
00:46:28.160,00:46:30.663,"No, ma'am. We at the FBI do not have a sense of humor we're aware of."
00:46:30.663,00:46:31.997,May we come in?
00:46:33.790,00:46:34.875,Sure.
00:46:34.875,00:46:36.252,Thank you.
00:46:36.252,00:46:37.670,"Oh, yes, please."
00:46:42.550,00:46:47.555,"The chief of police himself came up to the house, and did a full-out professional investigation."
00:46:47.555,00:46:52.977,"Took a police report and writ down everything I said, from A to Z, not believing one thing I said."
00:46:52.977,00:46:54.270,Sort of poking fun at me.
00:46:54.270,00:46:59.942,"And they asked me, If he was murdered, how was he able to walk back in the house?"
00:46:59.942,00:47:02.819,"And I got to admit to you, that that one got me sort of stumped."
00:47:02.819,00:47:07.325,But I'll tell you something right now. I know Edgar and that wasn't Edgar.
00:47:07.325,00:47:10.035,It's like something was wearing Edgar.
00:47:10.953,00:47:12.246,Like a...
00:47:12.246,00:47:14.123,Like a suit.
00:47:14.123,00:47:15.916,An Edgar suit.
00:47:22.881,00:47:25.760,Dude was that ugly before he was an alien.
00:47:29.305,00:47:30.807,I'm sorry.
00:47:30.807,00:47:33.058,Go on.
00:47:33.058,00:47:36.312,"Anyway, I come to and he's gone."
00:47:37.563,00:47:38.981,Did he say anything?
00:47:38.981,00:47:41.066,Yes. He asked me for some water.
00:47:42.276,00:47:44.612,Some sugar water.
00:47:44.612,00:47:46.030,Sugar water?
00:47:46.030,00:47:47.532,"Yeah, if I remember that right."
00:47:47.532,00:47:56.207,"Because I thought that that was odd, that he asked me for sugar water and not lemonade or ice water or regular water or tap water..."
00:47:57.834,00:48:00.336,"All right, Beatrice."
00:48:00.336,00:48:03.047,The flash of light you saw in the sky was not a UFO.
00:48:03.047,00:48:07.510,Swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted the light from Venus.
00:48:07.510,00:48:09.178,"Wait, wait a minute."
00:48:09.178,00:48:12.889,"So, you just flash that thing, it erases her memory and you just make up a new one?"
00:48:12.889,00:48:14.559,A standard-issue neuralizer.
00:48:14.559,00:48:16.977,And that weak-ass story is the best you can come up with?
00:48:16.977,00:48:19.021,All right.
00:48:19.021,00:48:22.441,"On a more personal note, Beatrice, Edgar ran off with an old girlfriend."
00:48:22.441,00:48:24.235,You're gonna stay with your mom a couple of nights.
00:48:24.235,00:48:26.278,You're gonna get over it and decide you're better off.
00:48:26.278,00:48:30.867,"Well, yeah, you know, 'cause, he never appreciated you anyway."
00:48:30.867,00:48:34.787,"In fact, you know what?"
00:48:34.787,00:48:40.418,"And now that he's gone, you gonna go in town, you go to Bloomingdale's, you find yourself some nice dresses, get yourself some shoes."
00:48:40.418,00:48:43.337,"You know, find somewhere, maybe, you could get a facial."
00:48:43.337,00:48:47.216,And hire a decorator to come in here quick 'cause...
00:48:47.216,00:48:48.509,Damn!
00:48:54.766,00:49:00.104,"JAY: Yo, Kay, look, check it out, man, when do I get my own flashy little memory messer-upper thingy?"
00:49:00.104,00:49:02.022,When you grow up.
00:49:02.022,00:49:03.357,Okay.
00:49:05.109,00:49:07.111,"Please, not green."
00:49:07.111,00:49:08.613,"Oh, damn."
00:49:10.197,00:49:15.369,"I don't suppose you know what kind of alien life form leaves a green spectral trail and craves sugar water, do you?"
00:49:15.369,00:49:19.665,"Wait, that was on Final Jeopardy last night."
00:49:19.665,00:49:21.292,"Zed, we have a bug."
00:49:22.376,00:49:25.296,So... What?
00:49:25.296,00:49:27.882,"Bugs thrive on carnage, tiger."
00:49:27.882,00:49:32.428,"They consume, infest, destroy, live off the death and destruction of other species."
00:49:32.428,00:49:34.305,"You were stung as a child, weren't you?"
00:49:34.305,00:49:47.234,"No. Listen, kid, imagine a giant cockroach with unlimited strength, a massive inferiority complex, and a real short temper is tear-assing around Manhattan Island in a brand new Edgar suit."
00:49:47.234,00:49:48.653,That sound like fun?
00:49:51.029,00:49:53.073,What's the move?
00:49:53.073,00:49:55.200,"With the bug in town, we'll watch the morgues."
00:50:07.922,00:50:10.006,Where do you want contestant number three?
00:50:10.006,00:50:13.051,Just leave it there.
00:50:13.051,00:50:16.054,"The cat. Yeah, well, there's a problem with the cat. Sign here."
00:50:16.054,00:50:17.306,What's the problem with the cat?
00:50:17.306,00:50:18.724,It's your problem.
00:50:22.436,00:50:23.771,I hate the living.
00:50:25.648,00:50:27.358,Shall we?
00:50:57.137,00:50:58.723,"Oh, my God!"
00:51:02.894,00:51:04.562,"Whoa, buddy, what are you?"
00:51:13.153,00:51:18.910,"Subject was approximately 112 degrees at time of autopsy, indicating an increase in body temperature."
00:51:18.910,00:51:25.041,"Examiner tried to verify this rectally, only to find the subject was without rectum, which is, needless to say, really..."
00:51:25.041,00:51:27.125,Weird!
00:51:27.125,00:51:30.838,"I'm Dr. Leo Manville, Department of Public Health."
00:51:32.256,00:51:34.174,You boys must not have much of a home life.
00:51:34.174,00:51:35.760,"We watch the morgues very carefully, ma'am."
00:51:35.760,00:51:37.970,"Tell me, do you have something unusual around here?"
00:51:37.970,00:51:40.639,I'd say so.
00:51:40.639,00:51:44.060,"The first body I opened up was pretty normal, except he was broken in half."
00:51:44.060,00:51:47.688,"But, when I opened up the other two..."
00:51:54.612,00:51:57.615,"There's a skeletal structure at work here, unlike anything I've ever seen before."
00:51:57.615,00:51:59.784,"KAY: All right, I'll have a look at this one."
00:51:59.784,00:52:02.244,"Dr. White, why don't you and Dr. Weaver check out the other body, please?"
00:52:02.244,00:52:06.749,"This way, Doctor."
00:52:06.749,00:52:10.002,I did a full laparotomy.
00:52:06.749,00:52:14.506,"I started with the lesser curvature of the stomach, but we could start with gastro-esophageal junction."
00:52:14.506,00:52:17.760,Let's start wherever you started at.
00:52:17.760,00:52:19.303,Okey-dokey.
00:52:21.179,00:52:22.473,Oh.
00:52:27.561,00:52:29.354,That's your cat?
00:52:29.354,00:52:32.357,Guess it is now.
00:52:32.357,00:52:33.901,I'm sure he won't mind.
00:52:37.613,00:52:40.449,You have really pretty eyes.
00:52:40.449,00:52:41.742,Thank you.
00:52:45.412,00:52:48.248,"Okay, you feel that?"
00:52:48.248,00:52:50.084,Push it aside.
00:52:50.084,00:52:53.504,Notice anything strange?
00:52:53.504,00:52:55.547,"Nope, all fine."
00:52:55.547,00:52:57.758,"Doctor, they're all missing!"
00:52:57.758,00:52:59.384,"Well, of course."
00:52:59.384,00:53:02.471,"Yeah, that's obviously the first thing I noticed."
00:53:02.471,00:53:10.186,"Well, what I was pointing out is the fact that there are no pieces of them left."
00:53:10.186,00:53:13.398,"Yeah, you know, so they're intact."
00:53:13.398,00:53:16.819,"I mean, wherever they are."
00:53:16.819,00:53:19.071,Have we met before?
00:53:19.071,00:53:21.365,I'm having the strangest feeling of deja vu.
00:53:22.616,00:53:23.868,"Yeah, me, too."
00:53:23.868,00:53:25.410,Really?
00:53:25.410,00:53:27.496,"Okay, do you wanna know what I really think?"
00:53:27.496,00:53:29.999,But don't tell that guy.
00:53:29.999,00:53:32.208,"See, I don't think this body's really a body."
00:53:32.208,00:53:35.420,I think it's some kind of transport unit for something else altogether.
00:53:35.420,00:53:37.464,"The question is, what?"
00:53:37.464,00:53:38.549,Mmm-hmm.
00:53:38.549,00:53:40.300,Is this freaking you out?
00:53:41.343,00:53:43.888,"No! No, girl!"
00:53:45.597,00:53:48.726,You know what I like to do sometimes when it's really late?
00:53:51.227,00:53:52.980,No.
00:53:52.980,00:53:54.523,KAY: Dr. White.
00:53:56.192,00:53:57.568,Excuse me.

00:54:03.824,00:54:07.494,Very interesting.
00:54:07.494,00:54:08.829,Of the body.
00:54:08.829,00:54:09.914,Great body.
00:54:09.914,00:54:11.456,The dead body.
00:54:11.456,00:54:13.542,"Oh, man you gonna have to look at that thing."
00:54:13.542,00:54:14.668,LAUREL: Dr. White?
00:54:14.668,00:54:16.670,You recognize him?
00:54:16.670,00:54:20.424,"Yeah. He looks like the big guy I saw down at the headquarters, only a little deader."
00:54:20.424,00:54:22.843,What do you think killed him?
00:54:22.843,00:54:23.886,A bug?
00:54:23.886,00:54:25.012,Dr. White.
00:54:25.012,00:54:26.597,"You're up, slugger."
00:54:30.392,00:54:31.852,Look at this.
00:54:33.437,00:54:35.606,What the hell is that?
00:54:53.540,00:55:03.634,Must to prevent contest.
00:55:03.634,00:55:05.636,JAY: It's okay.
00:55:05.636,00:55:07.263,To prevent...
00:55:07.263,00:55:10.724,To prevent struggle?
00:55:10.724,00:55:12.350,No.
00:55:12.350,00:55:13.894,To prevent...
00:55:13.894,00:55:15.353,War?
00:55:15.353,00:55:16.772,War.
00:55:18.899,00:55:26.448,The galaxy is on Orion's...

00:55:37.584,00:55:38.919,Orion's belt?
00:55:58.354,00:56:03.944,"To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's belt."
00:56:07.614,00:56:08.949,Doctor...
00:56:08.949,00:56:11.451,"Whatever, come here!"
00:56:11.451,00:56:15.039,"Dr. Whatever? Hey, you guys aren't really from the Department of Health, are you?"
00:56:15.039,00:56:19.293,"Rosenberg? Oh, damn!"
00:56:19.293,00:56:21.628,This guy was one of the royal family.
00:56:21.628,00:56:24.256,I knew it!
00:56:21.628,00:56:26.258,"This is an alien and you guys are from some government agency, trying to keep it under wraps."
00:56:26.258,00:56:30.262,"Look, he said, To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's belt."
00:56:30.262,00:56:32.388,LAUREL: This makes total sense. How else do you explain New York?
00:56:32.388,00:56:35.142,"The other day, I was in this cab, and this guy was..."
00:56:36.935,00:56:39.313,Galaxy on Orion's belt doesn't make any sense.
00:56:39.313,00:56:42.316,"Look that's what the little dude inside the big dude's head said, right?"
00:56:42.316,00:56:43.775,Right after...
00:56:43.775,00:56:46.362,"Damn, man."

00:56:49.948,00:56:52.951,"Yes, of course, young lady."
00:56:52.951,00:56:53.994,Would you stop that?
00:56:53.994,00:56:55.829,What?
00:56:55.829,00:56:58.498,"Man, that thing is gonna give her brain cancer or something."
00:56:58.498,00:57:00.251,Never hurt her before.

00:57:03.419,00:57:04.671,How many times have you flashy-thinged that poor woman?
00:57:04.671,00:57:06.422,Couple.

00:57:12.054,00:57:15.391,"I ain't playing with you, Kay! Have you ever flashy-thinged me?"
00:57:23.815,00:57:26.777,"Look, Kay, I think I should be in charge of the flashy memory thing department."
00:57:26.777,00:57:29.071,"Not while I'm around, ace."
00:57:29.071,00:57:31.656,"Hey, you ain't gonna be happy until you fricassee somebody's brain out, man!"
00:57:31.656,00:57:34.785,"All right, we got two dead aliens and a deputy medical examiner needs a new memory."
00:57:34.785,00:57:36.203,"Yes, sir."
00:57:37.788,00:57:40.207,Make it a happy memory.
00:58:13.198,00:58:15.784,Where is it?
00:58:30.424,00:58:35.929,WOMAN OVER PA: Will the owner of a blue warp speed cruiser please report to the front desk?
00:58:49.651,00:58:54.323,"Q, you have a phone call on line three. Please pick up."
00:58:59.077,00:59:04.166,"Hey, Zed, doesn't anybody ever get any sleep around here?"
00:59:04.166,00:59:08.545,The twins keep us on Centurion time.
00:59:08.545,00:59:10.088,Give it a few months.
00:59:10.088,00:59:13.091,Or you'll have a psychotic episode.
00:59:13.091,00:59:17.679,Here's Orion. It's a grouping of the brightest starts in the northern sky.
00:59:17.679,00:59:18.972,And here's Orion's belt.
00:59:18.972,00:59:20.557,Right. That's what the little guy said.
00:59:20.557,00:59:24.019,"To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's belt."
00:59:24.019,00:59:29.691,"Junior, there are no galaxies on Orion's belt. The belt is just these three stars."
00:59:29.691,00:59:34.363,Galaxies are huge.
00:59:35.697,00:59:38.075,"Look, whatever, man, I know what I heard."
01:00:15.070,01:00:16.363,Pretty lady.
01:00:19.032,01:00:21.452,Uh-huh.
01:00:21.452,01:00:28.041,Okay. The grumpy guy's story is starting to come into focus a little bit here.
01:00:28.041,01:00:30.919,"So, you were the guy in that picture you showed me with the flowers."
01:00:30.919,01:00:32.463,Yeah.
01:00:32.463,01:00:35.257,"And I take it, she never got those flowers."
01:00:35.257,01:00:36.758,No.
01:00:36.758,01:00:38.676,"So, what, she ever get married or anything?"
01:00:38.676,01:00:39.970,No.
01:00:39.970,01:00:42.139,"Well, you know, what they say."
01:00:42.139,01:00:45.934,It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.
01:00:45.934,01:00:47.978,Try it.

01:01:14.879,01:01:17.007,"All right, four thousand."
01:01:20.218,01:01:21.803,That's an Arquillian battle cruiser.
01:01:21.803,01:01:24.055,And we've got a dead Arquillian prince!
01:01:26.224,01:01:28.268,KAY: And speak of the devil.

01:01:53.918,01:01:55.837,"Now, that's what I'm talking about."
01:01:55.837,01:01:57.422,Noisy crickets.
01:01:59.633,01:02:01.759,"Hey, Kay. No, no."
01:02:01.759,01:02:05.639,"You get a series four de-atomize, I get a little midget cricket?"

01:04:13.475,01:04:17.103,"I don't know whether or not you forgotten, but there's a alien battle cruiser about to..."
01:04:17.103,01:04:24.110,"There's always an alien battle cruiser or a Korilian Death Ray, or an intergalactic plague that's about to wipe out life on this miserable little planet!"
01:04:24.110,01:04:28.281,The only way these people get on with their happy lives is they do not know about it!
01:04:33.244,01:04:35.413,And don't worry about the bug.
01:04:35.413,01:04:37.915,He's not leaving town.
01:04:42.962,01:04:45.882,"JAY: Excuse me. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen."
01:04:45.882,01:04:50.261,"Zed, we need a containment crew on MacDougal Street, south of Houston."
01:04:50.261,01:04:54.140,"Containment may be a moot point, old friend."
01:04:54.140,01:04:57.477,It's like the party is over and the last one to leave gets stuck with the check.
01:04:57.477,01:05:01.481,"Well, you sorry little ingrates!"

01:05:10.990,01:05:14.327,"We've only translated part of the message so far, Deliver the galaxy."

01:05:16.204,01:05:19.999,It gets better.

01:05:36.307,01:05:38.226,The city morgue?
01:05:48.069,01:05:51.030,"That's three for a dollar, sir!"
01:05:51.030,01:05:57.954,"It was some light, some light that refracted off of Venus into some swamp gas and that's what made the..."

01:05:59.581,01:06:01.416,Excuse me. What's up?
01:06:01.416,01:06:04.544,The Arquillians want the galaxy.
01:06:04.544,01:06:06.337,"We need help, a professional."
01:06:06.337,01:06:08.757,Somebody with years of experience in intergalactic politics.

01:06:37.243,01:06:40.371,"Now, that's the worst disguise ever. That guy's definitely an alien."
01:06:40.371,01:06:43.625,"You don't like it, you can kiss my furry little butt."
01:06:43.625,01:06:45.543,"You busy, Frank?"
01:06:45.543,01:06:47.211,"Sorry, Kay."
01:06:47.211,01:06:48.546,Get your paws off!
01:06:48.546,01:06:50.381,"Call the pound, we got a stray!"
01:06:50.381,01:06:52.467,The dog owes my friend money.
01:06:52.467,01:06:54.636,"Arquillians and bugs, Frank, what do you know?"
01:06:54.636,01:06:56.471,"Not a thing, huh?"
01:06:58.431,01:07:01.351,"Stop, stop, stop it."
01:07:01.351,01:07:03.561,Rosenberg wasn't some two-bit Arquillian.
01:07:03.561,01:07:05.522,He was the guardian of a whole galaxy!
01:07:05.522,01:07:07.106,They thought he'd be safe here on Earth.
01:07:07.106,01:07:09.192,And the bug had other plans.
01:07:09.192,01:07:11.987,The galaxy is the best source for subatomic energy in the universe.
01:07:11.987,01:07:15.198,"If the bugs get their slimy claws on it, kiss the Arquillians goodbye."
01:07:15.198,01:07:17.074,And ask him about the belt.
01:07:17.074,01:07:18.869,Rosenberg said something about a galaxy on Orion's belt.
01:07:18.869,01:07:20.244,"What's he talking about, Frank?"
01:07:20.244,01:07:21.329,Beats you? Okay!
01:07:21.329,01:07:23.707,"No, not around!"
01:07:26.417,01:07:28.586,They're rehearsing a ventriloquist act.
01:07:28.586,01:07:30.672,FRANK: The galaxy is here!
01:07:30.672,01:07:32.966,"What do you mean, here?"
01:07:32.966,01:07:35.134,Galaxy's hundreds of millions of stars and planets.
01:07:35.134,01:07:38.262,You humans.
01:07:38.262,01:07:41.474,"Just 'cause something's important, doesn't mean it's not very, very small."
01:07:41.474,01:07:42.976,How small?
01:07:42.976,01:07:45.436,"Tiny, like the size of a marble or a jewel."
01:07:45.436,01:07:48.690,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I got to be walked before my flight."
01:07:48.690,01:07:50.316,All right.
01:07:52.027,01:07:54.779,"If the galaxy's here, it's not on Orion's belt."
01:08:07.625,01:08:09.252,Kay!
01:08:15.425,01:08:17.427,"Boy, when you want attention."
01:08:19.012,01:08:23.892,Orion?
01:08:34.652,01:08:36.153,Wow!
01:09:16.569,01:09:20.615,Okay! Yes.
01:09:20.615,01:09:23.493,Thank you for making sure the bell works.
01:09:26.329,01:09:28.289,"What's up, Farmer John?"
01:09:29.791,01:09:32.836,A man came in here earlier.
01:09:32.836,01:09:34.253,A dead man.
01:09:34.253,01:09:35.839,And that means what to me?
01:09:38.174,01:09:41.552,It was a very dear friend of mine.
01:09:41.552,01:09:43.805,I believe he had an animal with him.
01:09:43.805,01:09:45.598,It was a gift I gave him.
01:09:45.598,01:09:46.641,A pet cat.
01:09:46.641,01:09:48.559,It means worlds to me.
01:09:48.559,01:09:50.687,I'd like to have it back.
01:09:50.687,01:09:58.820,"Okay, I'm gonna need a picture ID, written proof of ownership of the cat, notarized proof of kinship with the deceased."
01:09:58.820,01:10:00.446,Don't do that.
01:10:02.115,01:10:03.407,Do what?
01:10:04.325,01:10:05.785,Don't do it.
01:10:08.245,01:10:10.874,"Oh, man."
01:10:25.346,01:10:26.639,"Look, Kay, why don't you let me handle this one?"
01:10:26.639,01:10:28.558,What?
01:10:28.558,01:10:30.894,"Look, come on, man."
01:10:30.894,01:10:32.854,It's not really that hard.
01:10:30.894,01:10:35.272,"But if you go in there, you're gonna lay your Jack Webb on her, start flashing your brain ray all in her face."
01:10:35.272,01:10:37.608,She gonna wind up with leukemia or some shit.
01:10:37.608,01:10:40.403,Woman's a doctor. She don't need you flashing away half her med school classes.
01:10:40.403,01:10:41.487,Five minutes.
01:10:41.487,01:10:42.822,Two minutes.
01:10:45.575,01:10:46.951,Where's the animal?
01:10:46.951,01:10:48.536,"I told you, I don't know!"
01:10:48.536,01:10:49.996,"Well, let's see if we can find it!"
01:10:55.418,01:10:57.045,JAY: Hello!
01:10:59.338,01:11:00.673,Hello!
01:11:06.387,01:11:07.764,Hello!
01:11:11.726,01:11:13.519,How you doing?
01:11:13.519,01:11:16.522,"I'm Sergeant Friday, from the 26th Precinct."
01:11:16.522,01:11:20.317,A cat came in with a corpse the other day.
01:11:20.317,01:11:21.778,"Yes, that's right."
01:11:21.778,01:11:26.407,"Well, this cat is a witness in a murder case."
01:11:26.407,01:11:28.409,"I'm gonna need to take him with me, ask him a few questions."
01:11:28.409,01:11:30.369,"Well, I don't know where the cat is right now."
01:11:30.369,01:11:32.247,"Oh, you don't?"
01:11:32.247,01:11:35.499,"No, but maybe you could take me with you instead."
01:11:36.793,01:11:39.212,"Damn, you do start fast, don't you?"
01:11:39.212,01:11:42.215,I'd really like to go with you.
01:11:42.215,01:11:44.008,Now.
01:11:44.008,01:11:46.510,And exactly why is that?
01:11:53.726,01:11:56.395,There's something I need to show you.
01:11:56.395,01:11:59.690,"Slow down, girl."
01:11:59.690,01:12:03.527,"No, you don't understand."
01:12:03.527,01:12:04.737,"I will, I will."
01:12:04.737,01:12:06.656,"Oh, one thing."
01:12:06.656,01:12:08.866,I got to drive.
01:12:08.866,01:12:10.785,I'm saying that's just the way I get down.
01:12:21.587,01:12:23.840,"Look, stud, you're really not getting this."
01:12:23.840,01:12:27.677,There's something I need you to help me with.
01:12:38.771,01:12:39.730,"Freeze it, bug."
01:12:39.730,01:12:41.024,"Christ, you are thick!"
01:12:41.024,01:12:42.399,"Look, how was I supposed to know?"
01:12:42.399,01:12:44.485,"What did I have to do, sing it for you?"
01:12:44.485,01:12:45.903,"Well, if you weren't coming on like some drunken prom date..."
01:12:45.903,01:12:47.864,"Oh, God, that is so typical."
01:12:47.864,01:12:50.033,Anytime a woman shows the slightest hint of sexual independence...
01:12:50.033,01:12:51.326,...probably shut up!
01:12:51.326,01:12:52.618,"Let her go, shit-eater."
01:12:52.618,01:12:57.081,"Listen, monkey boy, compared to you humans, I'm on the top rung of the evolutionary ladder."
01:12:57.081,01:12:59.375,"So can it, all right?"
01:12:59.375,01:13:01.418,You're breaking my heart.
01:13:01.418,01:13:05.381,You ever pull the wings off a fly? You care to see the fly get even?
01:13:05.381,01:13:09.886,"How far do you think you're gonna get without your ship, if that's what you call the piece of space trash we got locked up in the office?"
01:13:09.886,01:13:11.554,Put your weapons down.
01:13:11.554,01:13:13.056,"Never gonna happen, insect."
01:13:13.056,01:13:14.140,"JAY: It's okay, Laurel."
01:13:14.140,01:13:15.725,How is it okay?
01:13:15.725,01:13:17.768,I'm saying it's gonna be okay.
01:13:17.768,01:13:19.729,"Don't bet on it, meat sock."
01:13:29.822,01:13:31.699,Let me go!
01:13:42.126,01:13:43.711,Go on!
01:13:48.007,01:13:49.008,Take me here.
01:13:49.008,01:13:50.551,No way.
01:13:51.969,01:13:53.637,Take me!
01:14:09.987,01:14:11.447,He's in a cab!
01:14:33.677,01:14:36.513,Don't move! Don't move!
01:14:36.513,01:14:38.849,"Hey, man, what?"
01:14:49.402,01:14:51.988,He's not leaving the planet in a cab.
01:14:56.909,01:14:59.829,Come with me.
01:14:59.829,01:15:01.747,"If it's not human, I don't want it to leave this island."
01:15:01.747,01:15:03.707,"Yes, sir."
01:15:03.707,01:15:05.168,What did we hear from our friends upstairs?
01:15:05.168,01:15:06.961,ZED: Same thing.
01:15:06.961,01:15:08.629,"Well, the bug's got the galaxy, but we got his ship."
01:15:08.629,01:15:09.964,He's got to be looking for a way out.
01:15:12.800,01:15:15.928,"FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE: Warning, protonic fusion detection."
01:15:15.928,01:15:18.806,"Warning, protonic fusion detection."
01:15:23.560,01:15:25.480,What the hell are they shooting at us for?
01:15:25.480,01:15:31.486,"KAY: Arquillian battle rules, kid. First, we get an ultimatum, then a warning shot and then we have a galactic standard week to respond."
01:15:31.486,01:15:33.946,A galactic standard week?
01:15:33.946,01:15:35.781,One hour.
01:15:35.781,01:15:38.242,One hour? Then what?
01:15:43.456,01:15:44.957,"JAY: Oh, that's bullshit!"
01:15:44.957,01:15:49.253,"KAY: Look, kid, to keep the bugs from getting it, the Arquillians will destroy that galaxy."
01:15:49.253,01:15:51.714,And whatever planet it's on.
01:15:52.965,01:15:54.008,You're talking about us?
01:15:54.008,01:15:55.718,"Sucks, huh?"
01:15:58.637,01:16:01.807,KAY: I'm pulling up the location of every interstellar vehicle within 100 miles.
01:16:01.807,01:16:03.851,ZED: I already did.
01:16:03.851,01:16:06.020,"Okay, we got Snedens Landing and Throgs Neck."
01:16:06.020,01:16:08.564,They're all gone.
01:16:08.564,01:16:10.066,"All right, Bayonne?"
01:16:10.066,01:16:11.275,"All right, there's Three Mile Island."
01:16:11.275,01:16:12.527,Gone.
01:16:12.527,01:16:13.652,Yo!
01:16:13.652,01:16:15.196,"Gone, thank God."
01:16:15.196,01:16:17.365,Fellas.
01:16:17.365,01:16:19.158,"If that bugs gets off the planet with that galaxy, we're all bug food."
01:16:19.158,01:16:21.911,"Hey, old guys!"
01:16:25.789,01:16:27.250,Do those still work?
01:16:42.765,01:16:44.225,EDGAR: You're coming with me.
01:16:44.225,01:16:45.684,What?
01:16:45.684,01:16:48.687,It's a long trip.
01:16:48.687,01:16:50.856,Whoa! Aah!

01:17:11.794,01:17:13.963,Do you remember the little red button?
01:17:13.963,01:17:15.798,Push the little red button.
01:17:15.798,01:17:18.717,And you may wanna put on a seat belt.
01:17:18.717,01:17:21.762,Kay!
01:17:30.062,01:17:31.355,"You know, you're much too tense."
01:17:31.355,01:17:36.819,"You're a young man, you need to relax, learn to take some joy in your work."
01:17:40.114,01:17:41.574,That's better?

01:18:40.757,01:18:42.635,I'm not telling you this to try to impress you!
01:18:42.635,01:18:45.012,I'm just letting you know it would start a war!
01:18:45.012,01:18:47.848,"Good, war! That means more food for my family."
01:18:47.848,01:18:49.600,All 78 million of them.
01:18:49.600,01:18:51.268,"That's a lot of mouths to feed, Your Highness."
01:18:51.268,01:18:54.063,"You're a wonderful dad, but I'm staying here!"
01:19:15.710,01:19:17.753,"Now, that's what I'm talking about!"
01:19:19.088,01:19:20.423,Roaches check in.
01:19:23.008,01:19:24.510,But they don't check out.

01:22:12.094,01:22:13.429,Like this?
01:22:32.489,01:22:34.032,Kay.
01:22:42.332,01:22:44.501,That did not go at all the way I planned.
01:22:44.501,01:22:46.378,"Whatever happens, don't let him get on the second ship."
01:22:46.378,01:22:47.379,What? What are you talking about?

01:23:45.521,01:23:49.191,Where you going?
01:23:50.275,01:23:52.361,Let me tell you something.
01:23:52.361,01:23:55.322,"There's only one way off of this planet, baby, and that's through me!"
01:24:36.363,01:24:41.243,"Hey, where you going?"
01:24:41.243,01:24:45.330,"Why you running, huh?"
01:24:45.330,01:24:51.294,"Come on, bring it."
01:25:06.309,01:25:08.771,"Uh-oh, I'm sorry."
01:25:08.771,01:25:11.982,Was that your auntie?
01:25:11.982,01:25:15.277,"Oh, then that must mean that that's your uncle, then, huh?"
01:25:17.071,01:25:19.322,"You know, y'all look alike."
01:25:26.789,01:25:28.624,"Well, well."
01:25:28.624,01:25:31.668,"Big bad bug got a bit of a soft spot, huh?"
01:25:35.380,01:25:43.847,"See, what I can't understand is why you got to come down here bringing all this ruckus, snatching up galaxies and everything."
01:25:43.847,01:25:48.894,"My attitude is, Don't start nothing, won't be nothing."
01:25:54.316,01:25:58.153,You need to ease up out of my face before something bad happen to you.
01:26:00.155,01:26:01.490,Too late.
01:26:29.184,01:26:33.271,"Zed, call the Arquillians."
01:26:33.271,01:26:34.690,"ZED: You got it, friend."
01:26:37.192,01:26:39.486,"Going to get your gun back, huh?"
01:26:39.486,01:26:41.571,I like this gun.
01:26:41.571,01:26:46.242,"Yeah, well, while you was in there playing around, I was down here doing all the work."
01:26:46.242,01:26:49.412,"You know, first I had to beat him in the head with this big rock."
01:26:49.412,01:26:51.414,Then I was gonna hit him with this two-by-four.
01:26:51.414,01:26:53.583,He kicked me.
01:26:53.583,01:26:56.211,But then I got to the fire.
01:26:56.211,01:26:59.589,"Not bad for your second day of work, is it? Huh?"
01:26:59.589,01:27:03.177,This definitely rates about a 9.0 on my weird-shit-o-meter.
01:27:03.177,01:27:06.722,Should have been here for the Zeronion migration in 1968.
01:27:09.474,01:27:11.935,"I guess you weren't even alive in '68, were you?"
01:27:18.192,01:27:20.569,Interesting job you guys have.
01:27:35.250,01:27:43.717,"Kay, look, I know we got these rules and everything, but I was thinking she did help us bust that bug and maybe we don't have to flashy-thing her."
01:27:45.343,01:27:47.512,"Kay, come on, man."
01:27:47.512,01:27:49.347,She hang out with all dead people.
01:27:49.347,01:27:50.766,It's not for her.
01:27:50.766,01:27:52.434,It's for me.
01:27:54.269,01:27:55.604,What?
01:27:57.439,01:27:59.399,"They're beautiful, aren't they?"
01:28:00.358,01:28:02.485,Stars.
01:28:02.485,01:28:09.284,"I mean, I never look at them anymore, but they actually are quite, um, beautiful."
01:28:12.412,01:28:13.872,Uh...
01:28:13.872,01:28:16.416,"Kay, you're frightening your partner."
01:28:16.416,01:28:17.751,I haven't been training a partner.
01:28:17.751,01:28:19.544,I've been training a replacement.
01:28:20.754,01:28:22.714,"Wait a minute, Kay."
01:28:22.714,01:28:24.841,I cannot do this job by myself.
01:28:24.841,01:28:28.303,"Hey, guys, my apartment isn't anywhere near here."
01:28:28.303,01:28:30.055,It's not even on the same island.
01:28:31.640,01:28:35.894,"Days, months, years."
01:28:35.894,01:28:37.520,Always face it forward.
01:28:45.570,01:28:47.572,Kay...
01:28:47.572,01:28:49.616,"I've just been down the gullet of an interstellar cockroach, kid."
01:28:49.616,01:28:52.119,That's one of a hundred memories that I don't want.
01:29:09.761,01:29:11.596,"See you around, Jay."
01:29:17.435,01:29:19.938,"No, you won't."
01:29:53.513,01:29:56.933,"LAUREL: Hey, Jay!"
01:29:56.933,01:30:00.937,The High Consulate from Solaxiant Nine wants floor seats for the next Bulls game.
01:30:00.937,01:30:05.775,"All right, let's put in a call to Dennis Rodman."
01:30:05.775,01:30:07.736,Rodman?
01:30:07.736,01:30:09.529,Nope.
01:30:09.529,01:30:11.031,Not much of a disguise.

00:04:40.580,00:04:42.949,Welcome to the United States.
00:04:43.650,00:04:45.818,"Where are you going, Nogales?"
00:04:46.052,00:04:47.820,Looking for work?
00:04:48.354,00:04:49.789,"And you, the same?"
00:04:50.056,00:04:51.557,And you?
00:04:51.891,00:04:53.526,Pleasure seeing you here.
00:04:53.993,00:04:55.595,And you?
00:04:56.529,00:04:58.965,What if I break your face?
00:05:01.501,00:05:03.703,"You're very ugly, no?"
00:05:05.638,00:05:07.674,You don't speak a word of Spanish.
00:05:12.412,00:05:14.614,The rest of you can leave.
00:05:14.781,00:05:16.349,Don't move!
00:05:16.516,00:05:17.684,Get in the truck and leave.
00:05:26.459,00:05:29.362,Get in the truck right now!
00:41:38.662,00:41:42.833,Sorry I'm late. The cab drivers on this planet are terrible.
00:41:43.000,00:41:45.503,"Your Majesty, you are in grave danger."
00:41:45.669,00:41:48.672,"Yeah, and they overcharge you every time."
00:41:48.839,00:41:52.843,"Sir, a bug landed here. We must get you off the planet."
00:41:53.010,00:41:55.212,A bug? He must know why I'm here.
00:41:55.613,00:41:56.981,We think he does.
00:41:58.616,00:42:00.117,Is that what I think it is?
00:42:00.284,00:42:02.720,"No, just some diamonds for your children."
00:42:02.887,00:42:04.622,Do we have time to eat?
00:42:05.222,00:42:08.759,Sure. I ordered you some Pirogi.
00:42:28.145,00:42:31.148,To the continued reign of the Arquillian Empire.
00:42:31.315,00:42:33.551,To the safety of the Galaxy.
