00:03:26.456,00:03:32.295,"WOMAN: Dear God, watch over me as I embark on this next posting."
00:03:32.420,00:03:34.673,Think I'll have to get up at about 6 tomorrow.
00:03:41.429,00:03:46.685,The pain in my stomach persists and is now further hampered by menstruation.
00:03:46.810,00:03:49.521,I've taken two ibuprofen and milk of magnesia.
00:03:55.152,00:04:00.240,"Forgive me my impatience, but I hope you will reveal your plan for me soon."
00:04:00.365,00:04:04.244,I can't shake the feeling that you must've saved me for something greater than this.
00:04:06.955,00:04:09.416,Not that I'm complaining or anything.
00:04:09.541,00:04:10.458,Amen.
00:04:56.797,00:04:59.049,"Hi, are you Maud?"
00:04:59.174,00:05:02.552,I left some notes on the kitchen table with all of her bits.
00:05:02.677,00:05:04.512,She has a maid coming over tomorrow.
00:05:04.638,00:05:06.640,Try and keep her off the sauce.
00:05:06.765,00:05:09.434,Doctors just started her on a new course of B12 shots.
00:05:09.559,00:05:11.895,She can have one of those every evening before dinner.
00:05:12.020,00:05:14.606,Mm-hm.
00:05:14.731,00:05:16.650,Her Majesty's in there having a nap.
00:05:16.775,00:05:17.734,How is she?
00:05:19.153,00:05:20.695,Bit of a cunt.
00:05:20.821,00:05:21.947,Have fun.
00:06:08.160,00:06:11.412,"--and in recent days, the worst-hit by storms."
00:06:11.538,00:06:15.000,Citizens report being woken late last night by a deafening crash...
00:06:15.125,00:06:16.375,MAUD: Amanda Kohl.
00:06:17.460,00:06:18.879,Forty-nine years old.
00:06:19.004,00:06:21.048,Can you feel that?
00:06:21.173,00:06:23.800,Stage-four lymphoma of the spinal cord.
00:06:23.925,00:06:27.262,"Yep, yeah, yeah."
00:06:27.386,00:06:29.264,I dare say you'll be seeing this one soon.
00:06:29.388,00:06:30.932,Feel that?
00:06:31.058,00:06:32.100,We done?
00:06:32.226,00:06:33.643,MAUD: Mm-hm.
00:06:37.022,00:06:38.940,What time would you like dinner this evening?
00:06:39.066,00:06:40.108,Eight o'clock.
00:06:42.652,00:06:45.404,There is a shopping list on the hall table.
00:06:48.158,00:06:49.201,I got it.
00:06:59.753,00:07:00.754,Right.
00:07:11.098,00:07:13.474,I looked her up before I came here.
00:07:13.600,00:07:17.562,"Dancer, choreographer, minor celebrity."
00:07:17.687,00:07:23.318,"As you know, I have little time for creative types, as they tend to be rather self-involved."
00:07:33.120,00:07:34.495,What are you cooking up in there?
00:07:34.621,00:07:37.791,Spaghetti Bolognese and garlic bread.
00:07:37.916,00:07:38.875,Splendid.
00:07:58.645,00:08:01.231,Is that temperature all right?
00:08:45.066,00:08:46.526,Oh. Hello.
00:08:50.238,00:08:52.532,Who's your saint?
00:08:53.992,00:08:55.952,I didn't know they made necklaces of her.
00:08:57.620,00:08:58.746,I ordered it online.
00:09:05.586,00:09:07.964,You're prettier than the last one.
00:10:25.417,00:10:26.460,Hey.
00:10:28.503,00:10:29.629,What do you think?
00:10:30.255,00:10:31.298,It's good.
00:10:42.434,00:10:44.185,MAN: You must be Mary.
00:10:46.521,00:10:48.064,"We're not turfing you out, are we?"
00:10:48.189,00:10:51.067,"No, I'm going to meet a friend."
00:10:51.192,00:10:51.985,"Cheerio, then."
00:10:55.071,00:10:58.366,I should've told her I'd have been happy just to stay in my room.
00:11:00.452,00:11:01.786,She must be embarrassed.
00:11:10.295,00:11:12.172,"MAN 1: Can you spare some change, please?"
00:11:12.297,00:11:14.132,"MAN 2: Sorry, mate, I ain't got nothing."
00:11:14.257,00:11:15.550,"Fuck off, then."
00:11:18.011,00:11:19.804,"Excuse me, miss?"
00:11:19.929,00:11:21.306,Can you spare some change?
00:11:27.228,00:11:28.438,"Thank you, love."
00:11:28.563,00:11:30.773,"A bit nippy out, isn't it?"
00:11:30.898,00:11:33.193,May God bless you and never waste your pain.
00:11:33.318,00:11:34.819,What?
00:11:36.446,00:11:37.947,"God bless you too, sweetheart."
00:11:45.079,00:11:48.707,MAUD: Why would someone like her end up in a town like this?
00:11:51.419,00:11:55.423,This dump can't appeal to her any more than it does to me.
00:12:05.225,00:12:07.268,MAUD: Hello?
00:12:07.394,00:12:09.229,"Oh, what's happened?"
00:12:09.354,00:12:10.605,MAN: Come back to London.
00:12:10.771,00:12:12.232,You can't lock yourself up in here.
00:12:12.357,00:12:13.900,You should be around people.
00:12:14.025,00:12:16.152,AMANDA: Why the fuck do you care all of a sudden?
00:12:16.277,00:12:19.072,"Darling, don't be petulant."
00:12:19.197,00:12:20.699,Fuck you!
00:12:20.823,00:12:22.617,Stupid cow.
00:12:24.077,00:12:25.744,Hello.
00:12:30.291,00:12:32.126,Sorry to call you back early.
00:12:32.252,00:12:35.255,Silly old thing used to knock it back no problem.
00:12:35.380,00:12:36.755,Even I couldn't keep up with her.
00:12:36.881,00:12:38.383,MAUD: Things are different now.
00:12:38.508,00:12:40.885,"Yes. Yes, of course."
00:12:43.263,00:12:45.306,"Do you, um, need me to do anything?"
00:12:45.432,00:12:46.807,No.
00:12:46.933,00:12:48.059,She'll be all right?
00:12:48.184,00:12:50.853,"Oh, don't be an idiot, Richard."
00:12:50.978,00:12:53.440,"Yes, well, take care of yourself, darling."
00:13:10.957,00:13:12.751,Pompous asshole.
00:13:12.875,00:13:14.586,You should've seen him way back when.
00:13:14.711,00:13:16.003,Constantly trying to fuck me.
00:13:16.129,00:13:18.256,He has plugs now.
00:13:18.381,00:13:20.508,No.
00:13:20.634,00:13:23.595,"Well, no one sees what they don't want to."
00:13:53.792,00:13:54.833,Stay with me.
00:13:57.962,00:13:59.714,I don't want to be alone.
00:14:15.021,00:14:17.398,How long have you been doing this?
00:14:17.524,00:14:18.566,Just over a year.
00:14:20.652,00:14:22.570,What were you doing before?
00:14:22.696,00:14:24.989,I worked at St. Afra's Hospital.
00:14:25.114,00:14:27.074,Horrible place.
00:14:30.662,00:14:32.955,Have you seen a lot of death?
00:14:33.080,00:14:33.873,Yes.
00:14:36.209,00:14:37.585,What made you leave?
00:14:42.965,00:14:44.967,I don't know.
00:14:47.428,00:14:48.304,I don't know.
00:14:51.725,00:14:53.351,I got spread too thin.
00:14:57.188,00:14:58.356,And it's what God wanted.
00:14:59.816,00:15:01.735,"When he came, everything changed."
00:15:03.277,00:15:05.363,"So, this is a recent conversion."
00:15:09.784,00:15:12.370,"When you pray, do you get a response?"
00:15:16.583,00:15:18.418,Sometimes he talks.
00:15:20.754,00:15:21.921,You hear his voice?
00:15:24.883,00:15:28.469,"Most of the time, it's just..."
00:15:28.595,00:15:30.680,like he's physically...
00:15:30.805,00:15:33.307,in me or around me.
00:15:35.142,00:15:36.227,It's how he guides me.
00:15:37.854,00:15:45.653,"Like, when he's pleased, it's like a shiver, or sometimes it's like a pulsing."
00:15:47.029,00:15:50.617,And it's all...
00:15:52.493,00:15:53.787,He's just there.
00:16:07.967,00:16:09.636,Nothing feels real anymore.
00:16:11.638,00:16:18.728,"Ever since I moved back here, I keep thinking about that last moment and wondering..."
00:16:20.480,00:16:22.022,what it will be like.
00:16:23.357,00:16:24.984,What will I be looking at?
00:16:26.820,00:16:28.571,Will there be anyone else there?
00:16:33.701,00:16:34.994,And then what?
00:16:37.831,00:16:39.039,Nothing?
00:16:41.668,00:16:42.919,Tell me I'm wrong.
00:16:48.842,00:16:51.552,He has been.
00:16:51.678,00:16:53.554,"And not just afterwards, see?"
00:16:54.681,00:16:56.223,He's everywhere.
00:16:58.142,00:16:59.352,He sees you.
00:17:00.979,00:17:02.689,He won't let you fall.
00:17:16.661,00:17:18.162,My little savior.
00:19:17.115,00:19:19.617,"MAUD: Father, thank you."
00:19:20.910,00:19:23.871,And bring your hand to join...
00:19:25.748,00:19:27.333,your right hand.
00:19:27.458,00:19:31.253,And then draw a semicircle above your head.
00:19:31.378,00:19:34.924,"Now, don't get me wrong, palliative care is noble work."
00:19:37.176,00:19:39.846,But I always knew you had something more planned for me.
00:19:44.100,00:19:48.187,It takes nothing special to mop up after the decrepit and the dying.
00:19:50.148,00:19:54.234,"But to save a soul, that's quite something."
00:20:01.117,00:20:03.953,Your presence graces the air.
00:20:04.078,00:20:06.956,And I feel fuller of your love than ever before.
00:20:09.416,00:20:11.251,More than enough to share.
00:20:23.389,00:20:24.974,Oh...
00:20:47.914,00:20:49.248,WOMAN: I can see you.
00:20:54.837,00:20:55.880,Yes?
00:20:58.174,00:21:00.426,Cynthia left?
00:21:00.551,00:21:01.635,Carol.
00:21:01.761,00:21:03.554,It's too late to be visiting now.
00:21:03.679,00:21:05.264,It-- She's expecting me.
00:21:09.727,00:21:10.561,She's sleeping.
00:22:25.928,00:22:27.345,AMANDA: Maud!
00:22:28.222,00:22:29.431,Come and join me.
00:22:36.814,00:22:43.196,"John said it was his final wish to have a peaceful, pain-free death with his family by his side."
00:22:43.321,00:22:44.613,"REPORTER 2: Thanks, Julia."
00:22:44.738,00:22:49.535,"Before he passed, John wrote an open letter to MPs here in England."
00:22:49.660,00:23:04.925,"He wanted everybody to know-- Dear God, here is Amanda."
00:23:05.051,00:23:07.385,"Well, you know that."
00:23:07.511,00:23:10.764,"Thank you for bringing us together, Lord."
00:23:10.890,00:23:13.600,And thank you for this meal which we gratefully receive.
00:23:18.564,00:23:25.612,"Bless Amanda's body, which is hurting now but has done so many wonderful things."
00:23:25.738,00:23:29.449,"And bless her mind, which is shrouded in darkness."
00:23:30.951,00:23:33.411,And reach out to her like you did to me.
00:23:35.122,00:23:36.207,Amen.
00:23:45.716,00:23:46.842,He's here?
00:23:57.353,00:23:59.313,I feel it too.
00:24:56.703,00:24:57.746,You look beautiful.
00:24:58.956,00:25:00.166,No.
00:25:00.291,00:25:01.375,Yes.
00:26:11.778,00:26:12.570,Hey.
00:26:14.490,00:26:16.283,Not going tonight.
00:26:16.409,00:26:17.993,You know I am.
00:26:18.118,00:26:19.619,She's all right.
00:26:19.745,00:26:21.997,"Bit weird, but..."
00:26:22.122,00:26:22.998,Shh! I gotta go.
00:26:23.957,00:26:25.251,"Okay, okay. Bye. Bye."
00:26:28.962,00:26:31.215,"Maud, your face. Heh."
00:26:42.600,00:26:44.520,"Oh, shit."
00:26:44.644,00:26:47.523,"Fuck, it's all over my dressing gown. Shit."
00:26:49.233,00:26:50.526,"Maud, I can do it."
00:26:51.527,00:26:53.362,Don't let her drink too much.
00:26:53.487,00:26:55.114,Don't worry. It's mostly for me.
00:26:57.575,00:27:00.327,"AMANDA: Honey, come back to me!"
00:27:05.665,00:27:13.549,"MAUD: Religious themes would play a prominent role throughout Blake's career, namely a rejection of organized religion..."
00:27:15.633,00:27:21.599,which he claimed was an ugly distortion 'of a true spiritual life.' Hm.
00:28:39.176,00:28:41.595,AMANDA: Catch you later.
00:28:44.014,00:28:45.599,Carol.
00:28:49.395,00:28:50.646,I need to talk to you.
00:28:51.897,00:28:52.772,Yeah?
00:28:56.735,00:28:57.736,What's up?
00:28:59.154,00:29:00.573,I want you to stop seeing Amanda.
00:29:00.698,00:29:03.659,Huh?
00:29:03.783,00:29:06.078,Did she tell you to talk to me?
00:29:06.203,00:29:08.205,It's an important time for her right now.
00:29:08.330,00:29:09.915,She's got big things to deal with.
00:29:10.040,00:29:12.543,And she needs to be focused.
00:29:12.668,00:29:15.713,I just don't think you can fit into that anymore.
00:29:15.837,00:29:20.133,"I don't know what you're talking about, but your patient's sex life is none of your business."
00:29:20.259,00:29:21.885,I know she's giving you money.
00:29:22.010,00:29:24.680,"Again, none of your fucking business."
00:29:24.804,00:29:28.350,"Look, I'm trying to be respectful."
00:29:28.475,00:29:31.978,I didn't swear at you or anything. I just...
00:29:32.104,00:29:35.733,I just don't think it's a good idea-- Please. Respectful?
00:29:35.857,00:29:37.735,"If you don't like that she fucks women, that's your problem."
00:29:37.859,00:29:42.698,You could have an eight-inch cock and I'd still tell you this after how you looked at her.
00:29:42.822,00:29:45.951,"Whoa, what?"
00:29:46.076,00:29:48.662,Do you think you're too good for her? That it's just a joke?
00:29:48.787,00:29:51.540,Of course not.
00:29:51.665,00:29:54.251,I have a responsibility to look after her.
00:29:55.544,00:29:57.630,This is life and death.
00:29:57.755,00:30:00.340,It's spiritual on another level.
00:30:00.466,00:30:02.175,No hard feelings.
00:30:02.301,00:30:07.097,"I'm sure you're great in bed, but really, you're just a waste of her time at the moment."
00:30:07.222,00:30:09.391,Can you hear yourself?
00:30:09.516,00:30:11.226,"Maud, you're her nurse."
00:30:11.351,00:30:15.272,"She doesn't want you to see it, but she is vulnerable right now."
00:30:15.397,00:30:21.570,It is not right that she spends her last days getting worked up about a silly girl who doesn't care about her.
00:30:21.695,00:30:23.822,I care about her.
00:30:25.907,00:30:28.118,What are you doing?
00:30:28.243,00:30:29.369,Oh.
00:30:31.997,00:30:34.458,"Okay, so you'll do it?"
00:30:34.583,00:30:35.834,"Anything you say, Maud."
00:30:38.462,00:30:40.714,Don't tell her I told you that.
00:30:40.839,00:30:43.091,"Just, you know, make something up."
00:30:44.134,00:30:45.844,Don't hurt her feelings.
00:30:45.969,00:30:47.346,Okay.
00:30:47.471,00:30:48.555,Okay.
00:30:55.895,00:30:57.481,Yes.
00:31:00.900,00:31:02.194,I think it went well.
00:31:05.405,00:31:08.534,A whole day and her phone has been silent.
00:31:09.951,00:31:11.953,It must be a relief to her too.
00:31:15.248,00:31:17.626,She radiates peace.
00:31:17.751,00:31:21.338,And I am reminded of myself in the first flashes of your love.
00:31:24.966,00:31:26.885,We don't need anyone else.
00:31:43.652,00:31:44.820,WOMAN: Katie?
00:31:48.240,00:31:50.659,Katie!
00:31:50.784,00:31:53.537,Katie. Hey.
00:31:55.038,00:31:56.915,How's it going?
00:31:57.541,00:31:58.584,"Yeah, good."
00:32:00.419,00:32:02.295,"How are you, Joy?"
00:32:02.421,00:32:05.424,"Yeah, not bad."
00:32:05.549,00:32:07.133,Got patients sleeping in corridors.
00:32:07.259,00:32:09.762,Surgery's all double-booked.
00:32:13.181,00:32:15.183,"So, how's it going?"
00:32:15.308,00:32:16.810,Yeah.
00:32:16.935,00:32:21.189,"We all thought you must've left town, not seeing you out and about anymore."
00:32:21.314,00:32:23.650,I've been around.
00:32:23.776,00:32:25.944,What are you up to?
00:32:27.237,00:32:29.823,You're still nursing?
00:32:29.948,00:32:32.534,Nothing. Just surprised.
00:32:32.659,00:32:33.869,"Sorry, where are you doing it?"
00:32:33.993,00:32:35.579,Who with?
00:32:35.704,00:32:37.080,They know what happened?
00:32:40.292,00:32:42.878,I've got to go.
00:32:44.797,00:32:45.964,Katie.
00:32:55.098,00:32:56.767,"Take my number, yeah?"
00:32:56.892,00:32:58.477,What?
00:32:58.602,00:33:01.980,"If you ever want to talk, or get a drink, or anything."
00:33:20.290,00:33:21.374,That one there.
00:33:25.295,00:33:26.588,"Yes, and then that one."
00:33:36.556,00:33:39.225,Oh. You can't do that.
00:33:39.351,00:33:43.146,You slipped those cards in.
00:33:43.271,00:33:44.857,Did I?
00:33:48.819,00:33:50.195,It's no fun if you cheat.
00:33:50.320,00:33:51.321,Which one was it?
00:33:52.781,00:33:53.782,That one.
00:33:55.868,00:33:57.911,Can you give me a moment?
00:33:58.036,00:33:59.830,"Uh, yes."
00:34:02.165,00:34:03.291,Oh!
00:34:03.416,00:34:05.043,Can I have a cup of tea?
00:34:07.671,00:34:09.882,Hello.
00:34:10.007,00:34:12.091,I didn't expect to hear from you.
00:34:22.728,00:34:24.062,AMANDA: What do you mean?
00:34:26.481,00:34:28.066,Why?
00:34:44.583,00:34:45.959,There you go.
00:34:50.171,00:34:53.008,"I've been thinking, it might be nice to go out sometime."
00:34:53.132,00:34:55.427,To the theater or something.
00:34:55.552,00:35:00.473,"I'd have no clue what to see, but I'm sure you could suggest something."
00:35:00.599,00:35:03.184,And maybe after I leave-- I want to go to bed.
00:35:06.229,00:35:07.647,It's 5:00.
00:35:07.773,00:35:10.108,I will go to bed when I damn well like.
00:35:12.069,00:35:13.361,"Yes, of course."
00:35:14.738,00:35:15.948,Now's not the time.
00:35:31.838,00:35:34.507,We've all been there.
00:35:34.633,00:35:36.718,Dry lips that chap under beautiful lipstick.
00:35:36.843,00:35:40.388,"You get the color you want, then you put this on and it flakes off."
00:35:40.513,00:35:42.181,"It's the worst, isn't it?"
00:35:42.307,00:35:43.475,"Now, look no further..."
00:36:44.911,00:36:46.454,I need you to go into town for me.
00:36:46.579,00:36:47.789,Yeah?
00:36:47.914,00:36:49.541,To pick up some things for tonight.
00:36:49.666,00:36:51.126,I'll make a list.
00:36:51.250,00:36:52.418,"Okay, no problem."
00:37:37.172,00:37:38.215,Yes!
00:37:45.513,00:37:48.516,And just know that I am done.
00:37:48.641,00:37:50.268,I am out of here.
00:37:58.317,00:38:00.486,Is it ready?
00:38:12.207,00:38:13.291,Plates.
00:38:16.086,00:38:17.420,Get the lights.
00:38:24.677,00:38:51.537,GUESTS: MAN: Light switch!
00:39:07.595,00:39:09.931,"So, Carol, how did you and Mandy meet?"
00:39:10.056,00:39:11.349,We met online.
00:39:11.474,00:39:13.351,Now you have a ménage à trois.
00:39:13.476,00:39:16.354,AMANDA: Maud doesn't like Carol.
00:39:16.479,00:39:20.441,"It's funny, I can't figure out if she's a bigot or if she's just jealous."
00:39:20.566,00:39:24.654,You know she went sneaking behind my back to try to scare Carol away?
00:39:26.614,00:39:30.368,"To save my soul, if I understand correctly."
00:39:33.038,00:39:34.413,Excuse me.
00:39:34.539,00:39:37.083,Don't run away.
00:39:37.209,00:39:41.171,"Maud is my savior, you see."
00:39:41.296,00:39:45.342,She's been looking out for me in more ways than one.
00:39:45.466,00:39:47.385,"You got a little carried away, didn't you?"
00:39:49.971,00:39:50.847,"So, what is it?"
00:39:53.933,00:39:55.601,Am I indecent?
00:39:55.727,00:39:57.229,"No, you're lost."
00:39:59.105,00:40:01.024,"Richard, will you show us some moves?"
00:40:01.149,00:40:02.441,RICHARD: But of course.
00:40:26.132,00:40:27.300,MAN: Trying to hide.
00:40:32.555,00:40:34.057,She looks like a Quaker.
00:40:34.182,00:40:36.101,She looks so silly.
00:40:37.685,00:40:39.437,There's my little saint.
00:40:42.481,00:40:44.567,"Oh, no, no."
00:40:44.692,00:40:47.695,You know you shouldn't take anything I say seriously.
00:40:47.820,00:40:49.572,I just want to see you loosen up.
00:40:49.697,00:40:51.866,"You're a beautiful, young woman."
00:40:51.991,00:40:54.577,And you should have some fun while you still can.
00:40:56.288,00:40:58.831,I've got more important things on my mind.
00:40:58.957,00:41:00.417,"Oh, yes, of course."
00:41:00.541,00:41:06.631,How could mere human frivolity possibly compete with the Heavenly Father's warm heart pulsing--?
00:41:08.758,00:41:10.343,Let's go. Let's go.
00:41:27.110,00:41:29.154,Maybe if you just let me talk to her.
00:41:29.279,00:41:30.738,Absolutely not.
00:41:30.863,00:41:33.491,You should be thankful she isn't pressing charges.
00:41:36.328,00:41:39.205,Miss Kohl expressed some other concerns.
00:41:39.331,00:41:40.665,Is everything all right?
00:41:44.961,00:41:46.129,I'm fine.
00:43:03.373,00:43:07.544,"God, all I feel of you now is this pain."
00:43:08.794,00:43:10.422,"Annoying, burning."
00:43:12.631,00:43:16.844,"Maybe it's ulcers, or cancer, or appendicitis."
00:43:18.471,00:43:22.600,"If you're trying to teach me something, I can't see what it is."
00:43:44.372,00:43:46.874,"Quite frankly, it all just seems such a waste."
00:43:49.877,00:43:53.631,"I was ready and open and alive, and this is my reward."
00:43:54.673,00:43:55.633,Unemployable.
00:43:57.176,00:43:58.344,Unoccupied.
00:44:04.016,00:44:06.311,Perhaps you weren't as wise as I thought.
00:44:07.895,00:44:10.940,Perhaps I wasn't paying enough attention.
00:44:22.076,00:44:26.164,I can't help but feel an act of spite has occurred.
00:44:35.089,00:44:37.925,If this was how you treat your most loyal subjects...
00:44:40.011,00:44:42.680,I shudder to think what awaits those who shun you.
00:44:49.937,00:44:52.315,WOMAN: ...I love! Oh!
00:44:57.153,00:44:57.987,"Oh, yeah."
00:46:25.116,00:46:27.452,"Yeah, that's right."
00:46:28.244,00:46:29.537,"Oh, yeah."
00:46:32.873,00:46:34.292,Okay.
00:46:34.417,00:46:36.294,"Oh, God."
00:46:38.212,00:46:39.838,God...
00:46:50.349,00:46:51.309,See you later.
00:47:14.749,00:47:16.668,Basically...
00:47:25.510,00:47:26.594,"In Russia, they..."
00:47:49.908,00:47:52.036,"Hey, Joy, it's Katie."
00:47:54.330,00:47:58.959,Hey. Yeah. I was just wondering if you want to go for a drink.
00:47:59.084,00:48:02.380,"You know, just have that chat and then just hang out."
00:48:02.505,00:48:03.880,I'd like to chat.
00:48:06.718,00:48:09.928,Cool. Great.
00:48:10.054,00:48:18.771,"Well, you know, if I'm honest with you, I did think it was kind of weird when I saw you and you suggested it, just because you never seemed to like me that much."
00:48:21.774,00:48:26.571,"No, no, no, I didn't mean-- Don't be like that."
00:48:28.197,00:48:33.661,"Well, I'm just starting with some friends, but I think they're heading off soon."
00:48:33.786,00:48:34.953,I'm gonna hang around a bit.
00:48:35.079,00:48:36.205,"WOMAN: Oh, sorry!"
00:48:37.790,00:48:38.833,"Yeah, of course."
00:48:40.543,00:48:43.128,"In that case, my apologies. I..."
00:48:43.254,00:48:45.089,"I'm pretty stupid, so bye."
00:49:03.190,00:49:04.941,MAN: How'd you do this afternoon?
00:49:16.704,00:49:19.248,WOMAN: Oh God!
00:49:19.373,00:49:21.041,Careful!
00:49:21.166,00:49:22.835,So sorry.
00:49:26.714,00:49:28.633,Oh!
00:49:30.342,00:49:31.719,Think you owe me a drink.
00:49:36.641,00:49:39.393,I'm okay.
00:49:42.855,00:49:43.980,Don't move.
00:50:01.123,00:50:02.500,Whoa!
00:50:02.625,00:50:04.000,Is everything okay?
00:50:08.714,00:50:10.132,It's okay. It's okay.
00:50:14.052,00:50:15.930,No. Come on.
00:50:17.431,00:50:19.976,Easy. Easy.
00:50:17.431,00:50:53.091,"No. I-- I remember you, you know."
00:50:55.427,00:50:58.848,"Yeah, you used to be out all the time. A while back."
00:51:00.474,00:51:01.517,I think...
00:51:03.059,00:51:05.061,you and my mate Tommy had it off.
00:51:06.814,00:51:09.608,Ahh. I remember you.
00:51:09.734,00:51:12.570,"A lovely, lovely little nursie, eh?"
00:52:11.754,00:52:12.964,I did everything.
00:52:14.966,00:52:17.133,Everything.
00:52:19.553,00:52:22.556,"I thought I did what you told me to do, didn't I?"
00:52:24.224,00:52:26.018,Please.
00:52:26.142,00:52:27.686,Please don't let me fall again.
00:52:29.563,00:52:30.689,I'm begging you.
00:52:32.232,00:52:33.233,I'll do anything.
00:52:35.653,00:52:37.488,Please guide me.
00:54:39.401,00:54:42.238,Revelation. And just in time.
00:54:45.032,00:54:48.160,"Oh, Lord, your mercy knows no bounds."
00:54:48.284,00:54:50.328,For shame that I almost fell so easily.
00:56:42.482,00:56:44.400,I should have expected resistance.
00:56:46.362,00:56:49.031,Nothing worthwhile comes easily.
00:57:11.053,00:57:12.428,MAUD: Amanda.
00:57:12.554,00:57:14.890,"Amanda, Amanda."
00:57:15.015,00:57:16.433,"You called to me, Amanda."
00:57:17.726,00:57:18.936,It was no small thing.
00:57:20.145,00:57:21.646,It meant something.
00:57:23.982,00:57:26.402,Never waste your pain.
00:57:26.526,00:57:29.071,Never waste your pain.
00:58:38.807,00:58:40.017,Beautiful.
00:58:40.142,00:58:41.518,Mm.
00:58:44.813,00:58:45.981,Do you mind if I sit?
00:58:46.106,00:58:47.941,"Mm, of course not."
00:58:54.198,00:58:57.034,"Oh. You don't work at St. Afra's, do you?"
00:58:57.159,00:58:59.077,"No, no."
00:58:59.203,00:59:01.538,"Oh, right."
00:59:01.663,00:59:04.082,I just have a friend who works at St. Afra's.
00:59:04.208,00:59:06.626,I wondered if you knew her.
00:59:07.961,00:59:13.509,I honestly have so much respect for anyone in the medical profession.
00:59:13.633,00:59:15.802,"Like, any area."
00:59:15.927,00:59:20.557,I really think it's the most important thing you can do with your life. Almost.
00:59:21.850,00:59:24.144,Thank you. So sweet.
00:59:24.269,00:59:27.356,"Yeah, it can be really rewarding."
00:59:27.481,00:59:31.318,"Not all that glamorous, but, yeah, I love it."
00:59:31.443,00:59:33.695,"I bet you get no time for yourself, though."
00:59:33.820,00:59:36.990,"Well, it's fine. I have my own life, my own things."
00:59:38.033,00:59:39.535,Got choir practice.
00:59:42.996,00:59:47.042,"So, this person you're with at the moment, what's wrong with them?"
00:59:48.835,00:59:51.338,I'm not really supposed to discuss the details.
00:59:51.463,00:59:53.798,You have a good relationship?
00:59:53.924,00:59:55.884,Really well.
00:59:56.009,00:59:59.096,I'm with a lovely lady at the minute. We're good pals.
01:00:01.181,01:00:03.725,That's one of the things I love about the job.
01:00:03.850,01:00:09.398,You find yourself quickly building these quite meaningful relationships.
01:00:09.523,01:00:14.319,"Well, you know, you're often right there at a very important time in people's lives."
01:00:17.781,01:00:20.200,Although that sometimes makes things harder in the end.
01:00:20.325,01:00:22.119,When you have to leave.
01:00:22.244,01:00:23.787,"No, when they die."
01:00:23.912,01:00:27.416,"I don't think I'll be with this one much longer, to be honest with you."
01:00:28.666,01:00:30.210,Sadly...
01:00:30.335,01:00:34.631,"that, as they say, is how the cookie crumbles."
01:00:39.177,01:00:43.557,"Oh! I'm Esther, by the way."
01:00:53.317,01:00:55.569,MAUD: What if I'm getting it all wrong?
01:00:57.112,01:01:00.698,What if you are smirking?
01:01:00.824,01:01:03.660,"Or think me a clueless idiot, like that stupid woman?"
01:01:06.622,01:01:08.665,Is that how Amanda saw me all along?
01:03:07.200,01:03:08.785,How will I know what to do?
01:03:11.162,01:04:53.973,VOICE: WOMAN: Katie?
01:04:58.102,01:04:59.604,"Katie, it's Joy."
01:05:07.028,01:05:08.321,There you are.
01:05:08.446,01:05:10.490,"Oh, sorry. Did I get you out of bed?"
01:05:11.783,01:05:14.369,Mind if I come in?
01:05:14.494,01:05:16.913,"I'll be quick, I promise."
01:05:19.916,01:05:21.084,"Thanks, love."
01:05:23.294,01:05:24.713,Oh...
01:05:25.714,01:05:26.757,This is nice.
01:05:29.967,01:05:31.928,"Cool. You ain't half tidy, are you?"
01:05:37.100,01:05:39.561,I hope you don't mind.
01:05:39.686,01:05:41.062,Just wanted to see how you are.
01:05:46.317,01:05:47.360,Oh.
01:05:47.485,01:05:49.028,This is cool.
01:05:49.153,01:05:50.447,I like all this.
01:05:52.031,01:05:53.658,Sorry I couldn't see you the other night.
01:05:53.784,01:05:55.118,I was so shattered.
01:05:55.243,01:05:57.454,I don't think I would have been much fun.
01:05:57.579,01:05:59.790,"I tried to call, but you didn't pick up."
01:06:01.124,01:06:02.083,Ciggy?
01:06:07.297,01:06:08.423,How's work going?
01:06:10.091,01:06:11.968,You're not with a patient at the moment?
01:06:20.769,01:06:24.648,I've been feeling bad about the way I reacted last time I saw you.
01:06:24.773,01:06:28.109,I'm sure you're doing a great job. You always did.
01:06:28.234,01:06:30.487,I know you put a lot of pressure on yourself.
01:06:32.656,01:06:36.284,"What happened before, it wasn't your fault."
01:06:37.786,01:06:39.036,"You do too, right?"
01:06:46.711,01:06:48.004,"What's going on, Katie?"
01:06:50.757,01:06:52.550,Come on.
01:06:54.552,01:06:58.264,"Look, I know it's a bit late now, but I wanted to tell you..."
01:06:58.389,01:07:01.893,I wanted to say that we should've been there before it all happened.
01:07:02.018,01:07:05.104,We could see you were struggling and no one did anything.
01:07:06.898,01:07:09.066,"You know, there's no time."
01:07:21.204,01:07:23.707,Now it feels like everyone's in their own little bubble.
01:07:27.335,01:07:28.879,But it does help to share.
01:07:47.898,01:07:51.275,"May the Lord bless and keep you, Joy."
01:07:51.401,01:07:53.277,You what?
01:07:53.403,01:07:56.406,"It was sweet of you to come, but you mustn't worry."
01:07:56.531,01:07:59.075,"You're right. Back then, I was so lost."
01:08:00.201,01:08:02.996,But now I am transformed.
01:08:03.120,01:08:06.290,"And soon, everyone will see."
01:08:08.209,01:08:10.795,"Right. Well, that's good."
01:08:10.921,01:08:12.672,"Thank you, Joy."
01:08:12.797,01:08:13.965,Thank you for coming.
01:08:19.303,01:08:21.264,"Oh. Oh, right."
01:08:24.267,01:08:25.894,"You sure you're okay, then?"
01:08:28.271,01:08:30.189,"Oh, fuck."
01:08:36.320,01:08:37.739,I'm gonna come back later.
01:08:37.864,01:08:40.324,All right?
01:08:40.450,01:08:42.577,I'm really glad things are looking up.
01:08:43.954,01:08:45.121,See you later.
01:11:57.188,01:11:59.482,I'm so sorry.
01:11:59.607,01:12:02.485,I was unkind to you.
01:12:02.610,01:12:04.946,You made me think of things I didn't want to.
01:12:08.658,01:12:09.575,It's all right.
01:12:10.743,01:12:13.830,No.
01:12:13.955,01:12:16.207,The Lord forgives that which is said in anger.
01:12:17.333,01:12:19.543,He knows your heart.
01:12:19.669,01:12:20.837,The Lord?
01:12:20.962,01:12:22.338,"Yes, God."
01:12:24.007,01:12:25.925,God sent me to you.
01:12:28.052,01:12:29.345,He forgives everything.
01:12:31.055,01:12:32.765,You only have to ask.
01:12:40.731,01:12:47.280,"Heavenly Father, bless this woman in her state-- No. None of that nonsense."
01:12:54.162,01:12:55.246,Amanda?
01:13:02.795,01:13:06.299,You must be the loneliest girl I've ever seen.
01:13:09.510,01:13:10.511,"I'm here, Amanda."
01:13:12.555,01:13:13.430,I am not alone.
01:13:15.308,01:13:16.600,And neither are you.
01:13:16.726,01:13:18.186,No!
01:13:18.311,01:13:20.730,"Snap out of it, honey."
01:13:25.902,01:13:27.028,He isn't real.
01:13:28.612,01:13:29.864,You must know that.
01:13:33.034,01:13:34.202,No.
01:13:34.327,01:13:36.620,"You felt him too, remember?"
01:13:36.746,01:13:38.706,We both did.
01:13:38.831,01:13:39.623,"No, honey."
01:13:41.251,01:13:42.335,I didn't.
01:13:45.213,01:13:46.839,That's not true.
01:13:48.674,01:13:51.719,You have no idea how dull it is to be dying.
01:13:57.892,01:14:03.147,"I hate to be the one to break it to you, but it's just you and me here."
01:14:06.650,01:14:08.694,Nothing you do matters.
01:14:18.955,01:14:21.374,"Well, that was easy."
01:14:26.796,01:14:28.005,Devil.
01:14:37.514,01:14:40.810,Take some responsibility for your actions.
01:14:40.935,01:14:44.188,You came back here because you are alone.
01:14:44.314,01:14:46.649,"If you were a true believer, he would be enough."
01:14:46.774,01:14:50.486,But it's clear now you're as weak as your faith.
01:18:37.796,01:18:39.549,"WOMAN: Oh, my God."
01:18:44.428,01:18:46.138,"WOMAN: Oh, my God."
01:18:46.263,01:18:47.848,"MAN: Hey, love!"
01:18:47.973,01:18:49.099,WOMAN: Help her!
01:18:49.225,01:18:51.268,"WOMAN: Oh, my God!"
