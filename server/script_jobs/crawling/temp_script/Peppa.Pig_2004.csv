00:00:04.800,00:00:06.920,George.
00:00:08.120,00:00:10.480,This is Mommy Pig.
00:00:10.480,00:00:11.880,And this is Daddy Pig.
00:00:13.320,00:00:14.680,Peppa Pig.
00:00:20.200,00:00:25.040,NARRATOR: Peppa and her family are visiting Uncle Pig and Auntie Pig and Cousin Chloe.
00:00:25.040,00:00:29.400,"I expect Uncle Pig will fall asleep after lunch, like he always does."
00:00:29.400,00:00:34.960,"Daddy Pig, you shouldn't say such things about your own brother, especially in front of the children."
00:00:34.960,00:00:36.160,But it's true.
00:00:36.160,00:00:51.520,"Uncle Pig always eats too much lunch and falls asleep, snoring loudly, like this: DADDY PIG: Uh, Peppa, George, forget what I just said about Uncle Pig."
00:00:51.520,00:00:52.720,"Okay, Daddy."
00:00:56.000,00:00:59.880,Peppa and her family have arrived at Uncle Pig and Auntie Pig's house.
00:00:59.880,00:01:02.360,"Hello, Auntie Pig and Uncle Pig."
00:01:02.360,00:01:03.680,Hello.
00:01:03.680,00:01:05.120,"Hello, everyone."
00:01:05.120,00:01:06.880,"Hello, big brother."
00:01:06.880,00:01:09.120,Uncle Pig is Daddy Pig's brother.
00:01:09.120,00:01:11.760,Chloé Pig is Peppa and George's cousin.
00:01:11.760,00:01:13.040,"Hello, Chloé."
00:01:13.040,00:01:14.520,"Hello, Peppa."
00:01:14.520,00:01:15.880,"Hello, George."
00:01:15.880,00:01:17.520,I want to show you something.
00:01:17.520,00:01:19.360,Wait for us!
00:01:21.640,00:01:24.840,This is my new puppet theatre.
00:01:24.840,00:01:27.360,My Daddy made it for me.
00:01:27.360,00:01:29.400,Wow.
00:01:29.400,00:01:31.800,I've made two puppets already.
00:01:31.800,00:01:33.880,This one is called Chloé.
00:01:33.880,00:01:36.160,Hello. I am Chloé Pig.
00:01:38.520,00:01:40.560,And this one is my Daddy.
00:01:40.560,00:01:41.840,Uncle pig.
00:01:41.840,00:01:44.760,"Hello, Peppa."
00:01:47.360,00:01:51.000,"Chloé, can me and George make puppets too?"
00:01:51.000,00:01:52.320,Yes.
00:01:54.160,00:01:56.400,Chloé paints the puppet's eyes.
00:01:57.400,00:02:00.240,Can I do the mouth?
00:02:00.240,00:02:02.320,My name is Peppa.
00:02:03.840,00:02:06.720,"George, what puppet would you like to make?"
00:02:06.720,00:02:07.960,Dinosaur!
00:02:07.960,00:02:09.640,A dinosaur?
00:02:09.640,00:02:13.720,George always says dinosaur for everything.
00:02:13.720,00:02:17.120,Okay. A scary dinosaur puppet.
00:02:17.120,00:02:20.040,Chloé is making George a dinosaur puppet.
00:02:20.040,00:02:22.160,It needs pointy teeth.
00:02:22.160,00:02:23.400,There.
00:02:23.400,00:02:25.520,A scary dinosaur.
00:02:26.760,00:02:28.440,Grrr.
00:02:30.040,00:02:32.400,"AUNTIE PIG: Lunchtime, everyone."
00:02:32.400,00:02:35.680,"After lunch, we'll do a puppet show.."
00:02:35.680,00:02:37.440,Hooray!
00:02:37.440,00:02:41.640,Auntie Pig has made spaghetti for lunch.
00:02:42.880,00:02:46.080,This spaghetti is delicious.
00:02:47.600,00:02:49.040,Best spaghetti ever.
00:02:49.040,00:02:51.200,You can tell you two are brothers.
00:02:51.200,00:02:52.920,Alike in every way.
00:02:54.240,00:02:55.520,What do you mean?
00:02:56.680,00:02:58.840,We are completely different.
00:03:00.280,00:03:04.600,"Peppa, George and I are going to do a puppet show."
00:03:04.600,00:03:06.880,Fantastic. Call us when you're ready.
00:03:06.880,00:03:08.680,See you later.
00:03:08.680,00:03:10.520,A puppet show.
00:03:11.760,00:03:13.920,Have I got time for some more spaghetti?
00:03:13.920,00:03:15.440,Could I have some more too?
00:03:18.920,00:03:21.640,The puppet show is about to begin.
00:03:23.880,00:03:26.360,"Hello, my name is Chloé."
00:03:26.360,00:03:28.320,And I am Peppa.
00:03:28.320,00:03:29.720,Grrr.
00:03:29.720,00:03:32.720,Aah! It's a dinosaur.
00:03:32.720,00:03:34.720,A scary dinosaur.
00:03:36.480,00:03:38.720,"Oh, I say."
00:03:38.720,00:03:40.520,Bravo.
00:03:40.520,00:03:44.600,"I am Uncle Pig Hello, Uncle Pig."
00:03:44.600,00:03:46.120,"Ho, ho, ho."
00:03:46.120,00:03:48.120,It looks just like you.
00:03:48.120,00:03:50.680,I think they've made my tummy a bit big.
00:03:50.680,00:03:53.680,"Ho, ho. I did enjoy my lunch."
00:03:55.120,00:04:01.400,"Uncle Pig, are you going to fall asleep and snore like you always do?"
00:04:01.400,00:04:03.280,What do you mean?
00:04:03.280,00:04:10.040,Daddy says you always fall asleep and snore loudly like this.
00:04:16.000,00:04:19.920,"Ho, ho. Your daddy's right."
00:04:22.640,00:04:26.760,"Daddy Pig, you shouldn't have said those things about Uncle Pig."
00:04:26.760,00:04:29.440,I don't think Daddy Pig or Uncle Pig can hear you.
00:04:29.440,00:04:32.840,Daddy Pig and Uncle Pig have fallen asleep.
00:04:32.840,00:04:34.840,You can tell they're brothers.
00:04:36.160,00:04:37.480,Eh? What happened?
00:04:37.480,00:04:38.720,Huh?
00:04:38.720,00:04:40.600,Has the puppet show started yet?
00:04:52.920,00:04:57.400,NARRATOR: Mommy Pig is watching a keep-fit program on television.
00:04:57.400,00:04:58.960,"Come on, now."
00:04:58.960,00:05:01.240,"Bend it, stretch it, bend it, stretch it."
00:05:02.520,00:05:04.640,I love watching telly.
00:05:04.640,00:05:06.160,What's this Mommy Pig?
00:05:06.160,00:05:09.760,It's a program about doing exercises to keep fit.
00:05:11.040,00:05:13.320,Thank goodness I don't have to exercise.
00:05:13.320,00:05:14.520,I'm naturally fit.
00:05:14.520,00:05:17.040,"You don't look very fit, Daddy."
00:05:17.040,00:05:19.440,Your tummy is a bit big.
00:05:19.440,00:05:21.720,I'm very fit.
00:05:21.720,00:05:23.520,What shall I do first?
00:05:23.520,00:05:26.600,Touch your toes like this.
00:05:26.600,00:05:28.200,Easy.
00:05:30.120,00:05:33.800,"Daddy, stop pretending that you can't touch your toes."
00:05:33.800,00:05:36.640,"Uh, I'm not pretending, Peppa."
00:05:36.640,00:05:39.560,NARRATOR: Daddy Pig really cannot touch his toes.
00:05:39.560,00:05:41.120,"Oh, dear, Daddy."
00:05:41.120,00:05:42.840,That's not very good.
00:05:42.840,00:05:46.440,"Hmm, maybe I should do a bit of exercise."
00:05:46.440,00:05:47.760,"Yes, Daddy."
00:05:47.760,00:05:50.560,And I will start...
00:05:50.560,00:05:51.840,MOMMY PIG: Daddy Pig!
00:05:51.840,00:05:54.240,You have to start exercising now!
00:05:54.240,00:05:55.520,Oh.
00:05:55.520,00:05:58.320,"Don't worry, Daddy."
00:05:58.320,00:06:00.000,"Oh, all right."
00:06:00.000,00:06:02.320,"Peppa, you're in charge of getting me fit."
00:06:02.320,00:06:04.160,What should I do first?
00:06:04.160,00:06:06.760,First you must do some press-ups.
00:06:06.760,00:06:08.480,Easy.
00:06:09.600,00:06:11.760,"One, two..."
00:06:11.760,00:06:14.200,There.
00:06:14.200,00:06:16.400,Now I want you to do...
00:06:16.400,00:06:17.800,100.
00:06:17.800,00:06:19.480,One hundred?
00:06:19.480,00:06:20.880,Yes.
00:06:20.880,00:06:23.280,"Come on, children."
00:06:23.280,00:06:24.560,I'll help as well.
00:06:24.560,00:06:25.720,"No, Daddy."
00:06:25.720,00:06:28.680,You've got 100 press-ups to do.
00:06:28.680,00:06:29.880,Oh.
00:06:29.880,00:06:31.520,One.
00:06:31.520,00:06:33.120,Two.
00:06:33.120,00:06:35.440,Three...
00:06:35.440,00:06:38.600,"Mommy Pig, Peppa and George are in the kitchen making lunch."
00:06:38.600,00:06:40.840,Daddy Pig is still doing his press-ups.
00:06:40.840,00:06:43.000,Daddy is doing very well.
00:06:43.000,00:06:44.680,DADDY PIG: ...Nine...10...
00:06:44.680,00:06:47.720,"Yes, I do hope he's not overdoing it."
00:06:47.720,00:06:48.920,I'll go and see.
00:06:48.920,00:06:56.040,"DADDY PIG: ...13, 14, 15, 16, 17..."
00:06:56.040,00:06:58.680,Daddy Pig!
00:06:58.680,00:07:00.840,You should be doing press-ups.
00:07:00.840,00:07:04.400,"Oh. Uh, there was something interesting on the TV."
00:07:04.400,00:07:05.920,Naughty Daddy.
00:07:05.920,00:07:09.560,Maybe Daddy will have more success with my old exercise bike.
00:07:09.560,00:07:11.800,Ah-ha. This looks like fun.
00:07:11.800,00:07:15.600,I'll be able to cycle and watch TV at the same time.
00:07:18.800,00:07:20.520,It's impossible.
00:07:20.520,00:07:22.040,This bike is too noisy.
00:07:22.040,00:07:23.840,I can't hear the TV.
00:07:23.840,00:07:26.160,You've got to get fit somehow.
00:07:26.160,00:07:27.320,I know!
00:07:27.320,00:07:29.680,You can use my bicycle.
00:07:29.680,00:07:32.720,"Yes, and then you'll get some fresh air as well."
00:07:34.400,00:07:37.320,Daddy Pig is going to ride on Peppa's little bicycle.
00:07:37.320,00:07:39.480,"Daddy, these are the pedals."
00:07:39.480,00:07:41.280,These are the brakes.
00:07:41.280,00:07:43.240,And this is the bell.
00:07:43.240,00:07:45.120,"Yes, yes. Thank you Peppa."
00:07:45.120,00:07:46.720,Bye-bye.
00:07:48.200,00:07:50.400,Easy as pie.
00:07:52.200,00:07:54.640,Getting fit is quite hard work.
00:07:58.680,00:08:01.520,Now I can get fit without having to pedal.
00:08:01.520,00:08:03.920,Daddy Pig is going very fast.
00:08:03.920,00:08:06.720,"Oh, maybe I'd better slow down."
00:08:06.720,00:08:08.360,Aah!
00:08:08.360,00:08:10.240,The brakes aren't strong enough.
00:08:10.240,00:08:12.840,Help! Aah!
00:08:15.120,00:08:16.720,Whoa!
00:08:22.120,00:08:25.600,Daddy Pig has been gone for a long time.
00:08:25.600,00:08:28.000,"Mommy, where can Daddy be?"
00:08:28.000,00:08:29.360,"Don't worry, Peppa..."
00:08:29.360,00:08:33.840,Daddy must be really enjoying himself to be away for so long.
00:08:39.520,00:08:42.240,Daddy! Where have you been?
00:08:42.240,00:08:47.400,"I whizzed all the way down the hill, then I had to push the bike all the way back up again."
00:08:47.400,00:08:49.640,"Oh, poor Daddy Pig."
00:08:49.640,00:08:52.200,"Well, at least I've done my exercise."
00:08:52.200,00:08:54.640,Yes. For today.
00:08:54.640,00:08:56.840,You have to do more exercise tomorrow.
00:08:56.840,00:08:58.720,What?
00:08:58.720,00:09:03.200,"Daddy, to get fit you have to exercise every day."
00:09:03.200,00:09:05.120,"Oh, no."
00:09:05.120,00:09:08.880,"But don't worry, Daddy."
00:09:08.880,00:09:10.960,Yes. I know you will.
00:09:24.320,00:09:28.720,NARRATOR: Peppa and George are in their bedroom playing with their toys.
00:09:28.720,00:09:34.320,"George, let's play dollies and dinosaurs Grrr!"
00:09:35.720,00:09:37.560,What is that?
00:09:37.560,00:09:40.120,It looks like a horrible monster.
00:09:40.120,00:09:42.720,Dinosaur. Grrr.
00:09:42.720,00:09:45.960,Aah! It's a dinosaur!

00:10:17.120,00:10:18.880,Help! Aah!
00:10:22.840,00:10:25.840,What on earth is going on?
00:10:25.840,00:10:27.760,What a lot of noise.
00:10:27.760,00:10:30.160,And look at all this mess on the floor.
00:10:30.160,00:10:32.600,Someone could trip over and hurt themselves.
00:10:32.600,00:10:35.960,Someone did trip over and hurt themselves.
00:10:35.960,00:10:38.080,"Oh, dear."
00:10:38.080,00:10:39.720,"Come on, children."
00:10:39.720,00:10:41.240,Let's do a bit of tidying up.
00:10:41.240,00:10:44.640,"But, Mommy, we're playing dollies and dinosaurs."
00:10:44.640,00:10:47.440,You can play again when you've tidied up.
00:10:47.440,00:10:50.440,But it's all George's mess.
00:10:50.440,00:10:52.280,Is it really?
00:10:52.280,00:10:55.040,So this must be one of George's lovely dresses?
00:10:56.240,00:10:57.760,No.
00:10:58.880,00:11:01.320,"Well, maybe some of the mess is mine."
00:11:03.040,00:11:07.120,"Right. I'll help George tidy, and Mommy Pig can help Peppa."
00:11:07.120,00:11:08.840,We can have a race.
00:11:08.840,00:11:10.640,Girls against boys.

00:05:18.280,00:05:20.960,Snort.
00:05:20.960,00:05:23.120,This is Grandpa Pig's vegetable garden.
00:05:23.120,00:05:26.000,He has grown all these vegetables himself.
00:05:26.000,00:05:27.880,Grrr.
00:05:27.880,00:05:29.520,GRANDPA: What's this?
00:05:29.520,00:05:31.720,Dine-saur.
00:05:31.720,00:05:34.640,A dinosaur? Ho-ho-ho-ho.
00:05:34.640,00:05:38.040,Snort. Let's choose some vegetables for lunch.
00:05:42.040,00:05:44.840,"Peppa, do you like tomatoes?"
00:05:44.840,00:05:46.960,"Snort. Yes, Grandpa Pig."
00:05:46.960,00:05:49.920,"George, do you like tomatoes?"
00:05:49.920,00:05:51.440,No.
00:05:52.720,00:05:55.400,George does not like tomatoes.
00:05:55.400,00:05:57.320,"Oh, dear."
00:06:00.480,00:06:02.600,Do you both like lettuce?
00:06:02.600,00:06:04.720,"Snort. Yes, Grandpa Pig."
00:06:04.720,00:06:06.080,No.
00:06:06.080,00:06:09.160,Snort. George does not like lettuce.
00:06:09.160,00:06:10.360,"Oh, dear."
00:06:10.360,00:06:13.520,I must have something that George likes.
00:06:14.920,00:06:16.760,Do you like cucumber?
00:06:16.760,00:06:18.360,Yuck.
00:06:18.360,00:06:23.600,George does not like cucumbers and he does not like lettuce and he does not like tomatoes.
00:06:23.600,00:06:27.480,"Well, George, what vegetable do you like?"
00:06:27.480,00:06:29.440,Chocolate cake.
00:06:29.440,00:06:31.600,Hee-hee-hee.
00:06:31.600,00:06:35.080,Chocolate cake isn't a vegetable.
00:06:35.080,00:06:36.200,Ho ho ho. Snort.
00:06:36.200,00:06:40.640,Maybe George will like the vegetables when they're made into a lovely salad.
00:06:43.480,00:06:48.480,"Ohh, lovely fresh tomatoes, lettuce and cucumber."
00:06:48.480,00:06:51.440,Snort.
00:06:51.440,00:06:54.800,Peppa and George help Granny Pig wash the vegetables.
00:07:00.120,00:07:03.160,Ha-ha-ha-ha. Snort.
00:07:05.800,00:07:10.160,"Granny Pig has made the tomatoes, lettuce and cucumber into a salad."
00:07:10.160,00:07:13.600,"Grandpa Pig, can you call everyone to lunch?"
00:07:13.600,00:07:15.840,Lunch!
00:07:17.520,00:07:20.040,Granny Pig has made pizza for lunch.
00:07:20.040,00:07:26.320,"And here's some salad made with Grandpa's tomatoes, lettuce and cucumber."
00:07:26.320,00:07:28.360,"Tuck in, everyone."
00:07:36.680,00:07:43.160,"George has eaten his pizza, but George does not like the tomatoes or the lettuce or the cucumber."
00:07:43.160,00:07:47.160,"Oh, dear, George."
00:07:47.160,00:07:48.240,No.
00:07:48.240,00:07:52.760,"George, just try a little bit of this lovely tomato."
00:07:52.760,00:07:53.880,Yuck.
00:07:53.880,00:07:56.840,"George, this is cucumber."
00:07:56.840,00:07:59.800,Grandpa Pig grew it in his garden.
00:07:59.800,00:08:01.320,Bleah.
00:08:01.320,00:08:03.600,"Try a piece of lettuce, George."
00:08:03.600,00:08:05.200,It's yummy.
00:08:08.640,00:08:10.760,"Now, now, George."
00:08:12.480,00:08:15.160,Look what I'm doing.
00:08:17.200,00:08:19.720,Now it's a dinosaur.
00:08:19.720,00:08:21.520,Oink. Dine-saur.
00:08:21.520,00:08:24.600,Hee-hee-hee. Grrr.
00:08:24.600,00:08:27.120,George loves dinosaurs.
00:08:27.120,00:08:31.200,"George is eating the tomatoes, lettuce and cucumber."
00:08:31.200,00:08:33.120,"Well done, George."
00:08:33.120,00:08:34.920,Oink.
00:08:34.920,00:08:36.960,"Would you like some more, George?"
00:08:36.960,00:08:38.400,Full.
00:08:38.400,00:08:44.440,"George, are you too full to eat any more tomatoes, lettuce or cucumber?"
00:08:44.440,00:08:45.680,Oink.
00:08:45.680,00:08:48.560,George is too full to eat any more.
00:08:48.560,00:08:51.440,"George, are you too full to eat anything more?"
00:08:51.440,00:08:52.800,"Oink, oink."
00:08:52.800,00:08:54.960,George is too full to eat anything more.
00:08:54.960,00:09:00.080,"Oh, well, then you won't want any of this chocolate cake."
00:09:00.080,00:09:02.200,Chocolate cake.
00:09:02.200,00:09:06.000,"Oink, oink. Hee-hee-hee."
00:09:06.000,00:09:08.080,GRANDPA PIG: My word.
00:09:08.080,00:09:11.080,George seems to have got his appetite back.
00:09:17.800,00:09:20.880,PEPPA: Camping.
00:09:20.880,00:09:23.280,Peppa and her family are going camping.
00:09:23.280,00:09:25.200,I love camping.
00:09:26.720,00:09:28.600,We're here.
00:09:28.600,00:09:30.640,"PEPPA, GEORGE, MUMMY: Hooray!"
00:09:32.840,00:09:38.840,"Peppa, George, this is the tent I had when I was a little boy."
00:09:38.840,00:09:42.360,"Daddy, how are you gonna make that into a tent?"
00:09:42.360,00:09:44.280,"DADDY PIG: Don't worry, Peppa."
00:09:44.280,00:09:46.760,I'm an expert at camping.
00:09:46.760,00:09:50.040,"Mummy Pig, put the tent on the poles, please."
00:09:50.040,00:09:51.480,That's it.
00:09:51.480,00:09:53.120,Easy as pie.
00:09:53.120,00:09:54.240,Oh.
00:09:54.240,00:09:55.880,Do these pegs do anything?
00:09:55.880,00:09:57.240,Of course.
00:09:57.240,00:09:59.840,I forgot about the pegs.
00:09:59.840,00:10:03.160,The pegs hold the tent up.
00:10:03.160,00:10:04.560,There.
00:10:04.560,00:10:07.160,Snort. The tent is a bit little.
00:10:07.160,00:10:11.960,"It was big enough for me when I was a boy, but it does look a bit small now."
00:10:11.960,00:10:15.880,"That's because you've grown a bit since you were a boy, Daddy Pig."
00:10:15.880,00:10:19.400,And your tummy has grown the most of all. Hee-hee.
00:10:19.400,00:10:23.720,"Ho-ho-ho. Talking of tummies, we should cook supper."
00:10:23.720,00:10:25.160,"Yes, yes."
00:10:25.160,00:10:28.320,First we have to collect sticks to make a fire.
00:10:28.320,00:10:29.320,Yipee!
00:10:29.320,00:10:33.560,Peppa and George are helping Daddy Pig collect sticks for the campfire.
00:10:33.560,00:10:36.560,"George, I'll pick up the sticks, and you can carry them."
00:10:36.560,00:10:38.040,"Oink, oink."
00:10:40.480,00:10:42.800,Collecting sticks is fun.
00:10:44.960,00:10:47.240,Good.
00:10:49.120,00:10:52.000,That's a splendid campfire.
00:10:52.000,00:10:53.800,Snort. Now I'll light it.
00:10:53.800,00:10:55.440,Here are the matches.
00:10:55.440,00:10:58.120,"Ho-ho, we don't need matches."
00:10:58.120,00:11:00.400,"Daddy, how can you light it without matches?"
00:11:00.400,00:11:05.520,"I'm going to make fire the old way, by simply rubbing these two sticks together."
00:11:05.520,00:11:11.600,Daddy Pig is rubbing the two sticks together to light the campfire.
00:11:13.720,00:11:15.680,Nearly there.
00:11:17.400,00:11:19.280,Hooray!
00:11:19.280,00:11:20.680,Easy as pie.
00:11:22.040,00:11:25.320,Snort. Now we can heat up the tomato soup.
00:11:25.320,00:11:29.040,"Ahh, listen to the sounds of nature."
00:11:30.280,00:11:32.080,What is that sound?
00:11:32.080,00:11:34.520,That is the sound of crickets chirping.
00:11:36.120,00:11:37.520,What is that?
00:11:37.520,00:11:39.000,That's an owl.
00:11:39.000,00:11:41.040,"Look, there it is."
00:11:42.320,00:11:43.720,Wow.
00:11:45.320,00:11:47.520,And what's that noise?
00:11:47.520,00:11:48.960,"Oh, I'm not sure."
00:11:50.560,00:11:52.320,It's Daddy's tummy.
00:11:54.200,00:11:57.400,My tummy rumbling is one of the best sounds of nature.
00:11:57.400,00:11:59.960,It means it's time to eat.
00:11:59.960,00:12:02.240,I love tomato soup.
00:12:02.240,00:12:03.720,So do I.
00:12:05.840,00:12:09.320,"Oh, there's another one of Daddy Pig's sounds of nature."
00:12:10.560,00:12:11.800,Eh? What?
00:12:12.920,00:12:15.040,"Come on, children, into the tent."
00:12:15.040,00:12:16.320,It's bedtime.
00:12:16.320,00:12:19.920,We won't all fit in.
00:12:19.920,00:12:23.200,It will be fine.
00:12:23.200,00:12:27.920,"Snort. Move further in, Mummy Pig."
00:12:27.920,00:12:30.920,"PEPPA: Daddy, you're too big for the tent."
00:12:30.920,00:12:32.760,Snort. Never mind.
00:12:32.760,00:12:34.840,I'd rather sleep outside anyway.
00:12:34.840,00:12:36.160,"Good night, Daddy Pig."
00:12:36.160,00:12:37.360,"Good night, Daddy."
00:12:37.360,00:12:38.520,Night. Night.
00:12:38.520,00:12:40.000,"Good night, everyone."
00:12:40.000,00:12:43.560,"Mummy Pig, Peppa and George are sleeping in the tent."
00:12:43.560,00:12:46.200,"Daddy Pig is sleeping outside, under the stars."
00:12:46.200,00:12:48.960,Ahh. I love camping.
00:12:48.960,00:12:52.840,Sleeping in the open air with the stars above me.
00:12:54.400,00:12:57.640,Maybe this wasn't such a good idea after all.
00:12:57.640,00:13:00.040,Brr.
00:13:01.600,00:13:03.120,It is morning.
00:13:03.120,00:13:07.040,"Daddy, it was lovely and cozy in the tent."
00:13:07.040,00:13:09.000,"Oh, where's Daddy?"
00:13:09.000,00:13:10.840,Daddy Pig has gone.
00:13:10.840,00:13:14.440,Poor Daddy Pig.
00:13:14.440,00:13:16.080,And now where is he?
00:13:18.080,00:13:19.720,What's that sound?
00:13:19.720,00:13:22.160,It sounds like snoring.
00:13:26.880,00:13:28.920,Hee-hee-hee.
00:13:28.920,00:13:30.160,What?
00:13:30.160,00:13:31.320,"Daddy, you're safe."
00:13:34.160,00:13:36.800,Snort.
00:13:36.800,00:13:38.920,I slept in the car.
00:13:38.920,00:13:41.080,Hee-hee. Silly Daddy.
00:13:41.080,00:13:43.680,Ho-ho.
00:13:52.400,00:13:55.120,PEPPA: The Sleepy Princess.
00:13:55.120,00:13:57.160,It is night time.
00:13:57.160,00:13:59.760,Peppa and George are going to bed.
00:14:03.480,00:14:05.680,"Good night, Peppa and George. Snort."
00:14:05.680,00:14:07.640,Mummy? Daddy?
00:14:07.640,00:14:08.800,"Yes, Peppa?"
00:14:08.800,00:14:12.720,I'm not sleepy.
00:14:12.720,00:14:15.400,But maybe George is sleepy and doesn't want a story.
00:14:15.400,00:14:17.840,"George, do you want a story?"
00:14:17.840,00:14:19.680,Say yes.
00:14:19.680,00:14:21.040,"Oink, oink."
00:14:21.040,00:14:22.760,Ho-ho-ho. Snort.
00:14:22.760,00:14:25.640,I will tell you just one story.
00:14:25.640,00:14:31.000,"Snort. If Daddy Pig tells you a story, you must both promise to go to sleep."
00:14:31.000,00:14:33.000,We promise. Snort.
00:14:33.000,00:14:34.480,"Oink, oink."
00:14:34.480,00:14:40.240,Hm. I think I'll tell you the story of The Sleepy Princess.
00:14:40.240,00:14:44.240,Is it a good story?
00:14:44.240,00:14:47.520,It's not boring.
00:14:47.520,00:14:50.480,Is there a little princess in it?
00:14:50.480,00:14:54.320,"Peppa, if you keep talking, Daddy Pig can't start the story."
00:14:54.320,00:14:55.760,"Sorry, Mummy."
00:14:55.760,00:14:59.120,"Is there a little princess in the story, Daddy?"
00:14:59.120,00:15:00.280,Ho-ho.
00:15:00.280,00:15:03.920,"Yes, there is a little princess in it."
00:15:05.440,00:15:06.560,"Oink, oink."
00:15:06.560,00:15:09.880,Hm. The Sleepy Princess.
00:15:14.000,00:15:23.160,"DADDY PIG: Once upon a time in a castle, there lived a little princess, and she was called the Sleepy Princess."
00:15:23.160,00:15:26.040,"Daddy, why was she called that?"
00:15:26.040,00:15:27.440,I'll get to that later.
00:15:27.440,00:15:30.000,Was the Sleepy Princess pretty?
00:15:30.000,00:15:32.080,"Yes, she was very pretty."
00:15:32.080,00:15:35.320,She loved looking at herself in the mirror.
00:15:35.320,00:15:39.240,I am so pretty. Snort.
00:15:39.240,00:15:41.840,Who else was living in the castle?
00:15:41.840,00:15:43.240,"Uh, well..."
00:15:43.240,00:15:46.880,The others in the castle were the Small Prince...
00:15:46.880,00:15:47.840,"Oink, oink."
00:15:47.840,00:15:49.840,Queen Mummy...
00:15:49.840,00:15:52.320,...and King Daddy.
00:15:52.320,00:15:55.200,That's right. They were all living there as well.
00:15:55.200,00:15:57.360,PEPPA: Did King Daddy have a big tummy?
00:15:57.360,00:16:00.640,Of course not.
00:16:00.640,00:16:02.000,Like me. Snort.
00:16:03.560,00:16:06.800,"Anyway, there was also a dragon."
00:16:06.800,00:16:08.160,Dine-saur!
00:16:08.160,00:16:09.480,A dinosaur?
00:16:09.480,00:16:13.520,"Oh, yes, it wasn't a dragon, it was a dinosaur."
00:16:13.520,00:16:18.840,Living outside was a huge fierce dinosaur.
00:16:18.840,00:16:22.240,Rawrrr! Rawrr-arr.
00:16:22.240,00:16:24.800,Rrawrrr!
00:16:24.800,00:16:27.440,"Oh, dear."
00:16:27.440,00:16:31.840,"Maybe the dinosaur wasn't quite that fierce, Daddy Pig?"
00:16:31.840,00:16:33.080,"Sorry, George."
00:16:33.080,00:16:36.880,"No, the dinosaur was very gentle."
00:16:36.880,00:16:39.480,It ate lots of grass.
00:16:43.840,00:16:44.880,Daddy Pig.

00:00:34.360,00:00:36.880,I am the DIY expert of the house.
00:00:36.880,00:00:38.920,Are you sure you can do it?
00:00:38.920,00:00:40.120,Of course.
00:00:40.120,00:00:43.480,I'll just put a nail in the wall and hang the picture on it.

00:01:12.000,00:01:14.200,And a pencil.

00:01:25.360,00:01:28.720,DADDY PIG: Now I need a hammer and a nail.
00:01:28.720,00:01:32.240,"Stand back, children, and watch a craftsman at work."

00:01:52.400,00:01:55.680,"Oh, Daddy."
00:01:55.680,00:01:59.480,It's just a tiny crack.
00:01:59.480,00:02:01.280,There.
00:02:01.280,00:02:03.880,"I can still see the crack, Daddy."

00:02:07.880,00:02:09.760,"Don't make a mess, Daddy."
00:02:09.760,00:02:11.920,"Don't be silly, Peppa."

00:02:35.880,00:02:37.760,What are they doing?
00:02:39.000,00:02:40.560,"Daddy, we can see you."
00:02:41.960,00:02:43.200,Hmm.
00:02:43.200,00:02:46.560,Daddy Pig has to mend the wall before Mommy Pig comes home.
00:02:49.560,00:02:51.440,"DADDY PIG: Brick, please."
00:02:51.440,00:02:54.240,"First, Daddy Pig fills the hole with bricks."
00:03:05.920,00:03:08.360,There.
00:03:08.360,00:03:11.960,"Next, Daddy Pig puts plaster over the bricks."
00:03:15.800,00:03:17.400,Easy as pie.

00:03:33.800,00:03:35.160,Goodness me.
00:03:35.160,00:03:37.680,We had better clean up before Mommy comes back.
00:03:44.600,00:03:47.240,And Daddy Pig tidies up the tools.

00:04:09.400,00:04:12.480,"Yes, I can see you've been doing nothing."
00:04:12.480,00:04:15.280,I thought you were going to put the picture up.
00:04:15.280,00:04:19.040,"In all the excitement, Daddy Pig has forgotten to put the picture up."
00:04:19.040,00:04:20.320,Oh.
00:04:20.320,00:04:24.280,"Well, I'm no expert, but I'm sure it's quite easy."
00:04:26.960,00:04:28.360,There.
00:04:28.360,00:04:32.080,"Hmm, yes, that did look quite easy."
00:04:32.080,00:04:35.160,"But when you did it, Daddy,, it looked really hard."
00:04:35.160,00:04:37.760,"Shush, Peppa."
00:04:50.320,00:04:54.440,NARRATOR: Peppa and her family are going to the beach.

00:05:08.360,00:05:15.200,"Sunshade, beach bag, towels, buckets and spades, and a spotty ball."
00:05:15.200,00:05:19.080,"Good. Now, before you start playing, you need some sun cream on you."
00:05:21.600,00:05:26.360,"The sun is very hot, so Peppa and George have to have sun cream on."
00:05:29.520,00:05:30.960,It seems to work.
00:05:32.160,00:05:33.840,What a great spotty ball.
00:05:39.120,00:05:42.920,"George, you throw the ball, and I will catch it."
00:05:46.120,00:05:48.200,"George, catch."
00:05:48.200,00:05:51.040,"Oh, dear. George is too little to catch the ball."
00:05:55.400,00:05:58.040,Would you and Peppa like to have a paddle in the sea?
00:05:58.040,00:06:00.280,"Yes, please, Daddy."
00:06:00.280,00:06:02.760,Let's put your water wings on.
00:06:08.160,00:06:09.600,There we go.

00:06:44.080,00:06:46.440,"You started it, Daddy Pig."
00:06:49.000,00:06:50.880,Maybe that's enough splashing.
00:06:52.120,00:06:53.440,Whee!
00:06:53.440,00:06:57.160,"Daddy, I love being at the beach."

00:07:33.680,00:07:35.520,Now you can't escape.
00:07:35.520,00:07:37.920,My head is getting a bit hot.
00:07:39.480,00:07:42.240,"Well, if you say please."
00:07:42.240,00:07:44.520,Please can I have my straw hat?
00:07:44.520,00:07:46.240,"Yes, you may, Daddy."
00:07:49.760,00:07:51.040,That's nice.
00:07:52.600,00:07:55.400,Maybe I'll just have a little sleep.
00:08:00.560,00:08:03.400,"George, let's make sand castles."
00:08:03.400,00:08:05.720,Peppa and George are making sand castles.
00:08:05.720,00:08:07.840,First we put sand in the buckets.
00:08:07.840,00:08:09.720,Like this.
00:08:11.440,00:08:15.640,We turn the buckets upside down and tap them.
00:08:15.640,00:08:17.520,And lift the bucket up.
00:08:17.520,00:08:19.480,"Hey, presto."

00:15:32.400,00:15:35.280,"There you are Peppa, now you're a tiger."
00:15:35.280,00:15:37.760,Ha-ha-ha. I'm a tiger. Oink.
00:15:37.760,00:15:40.080,"George, what would you like to be?"
00:15:40.080,00:15:42.760,Dine-saw. Grrr.
00:15:42.760,00:15:44.200,A dinosaur?
00:15:44.200,00:15:46.520,"Uh, how about a tiger instead?"
00:15:46.520,00:15:48.400,I'm good at tigers.
00:15:48.400,00:15:49.760,Oink. Oink.
00:15:49.760,00:15:52.080,Ha-ha-ha.
00:15:52.080,00:15:53.480,So am I.
00:15:53.480,00:15:56.520,"Meow. Tigers don't say, Woof, woof."
00:15:56.520,00:15:58.080,How do you know?
00:15:58.080,00:16:00.440,Because tigers are big cats.
00:16:00.440,00:16:02.560,Meow. And I'm a cat.
00:16:06.240,00:16:07.720,Okay.
00:16:07.720,00:16:12.720,"Tigers creep very, very slowly and then, they jump."
00:16:12.720,00:16:14.800,Grrr.
00:16:16.160,00:16:18.000,ALL: Grrr.
00:16:18.000,00:16:21.000,Tigers like to lick themselves clean.
00:16:23.440,00:16:27.160,"But, best of all, when tigers are happy, they purr."
00:16:31.400,00:16:32.720,"Hello, children."
00:16:32.720,00:16:34.400,Oh. My goodness.
00:16:34.400,00:16:36.120,You're all tigers.
00:16:36.120,00:16:39.320,And I'm teaching them to be proper tigers.
00:16:39.320,00:16:40.640,Grrr.
00:16:41.880,00:16:43.680,What do you little tigers want to do next?
00:16:43.680,00:16:45.520,Oink. Dine-saw.
00:16:45.520,00:16:49.080,That's right. We have to find George a dinosaur balloon.
00:16:50.720,00:16:52.320,Let's get you all balloons.
00:16:52.320,00:16:53.960,ALL: Hooray!
00:16:56.280,00:16:57.400,"Hello, Madame Gazelle."
00:17:00.200,00:17:02.360,I've got lots of different ones.
00:17:02.360,00:17:04.800,"Can I have an elephant balloon, please?"
00:17:04.800,00:17:06.720,"Here you are, Peppa."
00:17:06.720,00:17:08.840,Can I have a kangaroo?
00:17:08.840,00:17:10.440,"A lion, please."
00:17:10.440,00:17:11.840,"A monkey, please."
00:17:11.840,00:17:13.480,"A parrot, please."
00:17:13.480,00:17:15.720,"Ho, ho. Yes, I've got all those."
00:17:16.880,00:17:21.800,"Most important of all, we need a dinosaur balloon for George."
00:17:21.800,00:17:26.560,"Oh dear, I do not seem to have any dinosaur balloons."
00:17:31.280,00:17:34.720,"Don't worry, George. I've got an idea."
00:17:34.720,00:17:37.920,"Could we have two of the long balloons, please?"
00:17:37.920,00:17:39.720,"Watch this, everybody."
00:17:41.520,00:17:45.200,NARRATOR: What is Daddy Pig doing with the balloons?
00:17:45.200,00:17:48.360,There. Can anyone guess what it is?
00:17:48.360,00:17:50.560,Is it a kangaroo?
00:17:50.560,00:17:54.360,"Ho, ho. No, it's a-- Dine-saw."
00:17:54.360,00:17:56.400,DADDY: That's right. A dinosaur.
00:17:56.400,00:17:59.480,NARRATOR: Daddy Pig has made a balloon dinosaur.
00:17:59.480,00:18:02.520,Grrr. Dine-saw.
00:18:02.520,00:18:04.640,Oink.
00:18:08.120,00:18:11.680,NARRATOR: Peppa loves bouncing on the bouncy castle.
00:18:11.680,00:18:15.000,Everyone loves bouncing on the bouncy castle.
00:18:15.000,00:18:17.640,"This is the best school fete, ever."
00:00:29.520,00:00:32.640,NARRATOR: Peppa and George are playing hide-and-seek.
00:00:32.640,00:00:34.680,It is George's turn to hide.
00:00:34.680,00:00:38.680,He must quickly find somewhere to hide before Peppa finishes counting.
00:00:38.680,00:00:42.360,"One, two, three..."
00:00:43.520,00:00:47.960,"four, five, six, seven..."
00:00:49.520,00:00:52.120,George has found somewhere to hide just in time.
00:00:52.120,00:00:53.800,...10.
00:00:53.800,00:00:56.160,"Ready or not, here I come."
00:00:56.160,00:00:59.280,Peppa has to find where George is hiding.
00:01:02.040,00:01:04.080,Found you.
00:01:04.080,00:01:05.640,Peppa has found George.
00:01:05.640,00:01:08.520,"George, I could see you too easily."
00:01:10.160,00:01:12.080,Now it is Peppa's turn to hide.
00:01:12.080,00:01:15.960,One...um...three.
00:01:15.960,00:01:17.720,I'll help George to count.
00:01:18.960,00:01:23.280,"One, two, three..."
00:01:24.320,00:01:27.480,"four, five..."
00:01:37.360,00:01:40.600,"Okay, George, open your eyes."
00:01:42.720,00:01:45.120,George has to find where Peppa is hiding.
00:01:46.240,00:01:47.880,Oh.
00:01:47.880,00:01:50.720,Peppa isn't hiding under the table.
00:01:51.880,00:01:53.440,DADDY PIG: George.
00:01:53.440,00:01:55.960,Have you thought of looking upstairs?
00:02:09.120,00:02:10.840,Peppa isn't under the bed.
00:02:14.040,00:02:16.720,What was that strange noise?
00:02:21.680,00:02:23.680,Peppa isn't behind the curtain.
00:02:25.280,00:02:28.560,There is that strange noise again.
00:02:28.560,00:02:30.160,What can it be?
00:02:35.640,00:02:36.880,Whee!
00:02:38.880,00:02:41.360,George has found where Peppa was hiding.
00:02:46.120,00:02:47.320,George found me.
00:02:47.320,00:02:50.400,Now it is Daddy's turn to hide.
00:02:50.400,00:02:52.720,I think George should have another turn.
00:02:54.200,00:02:57.400,But George isn't very good at hiding.
00:02:57.400,00:02:59.400,I'm sure he'll be better this time.
00:02:59.400,00:03:02.200,Close your eyes and start counting.
00:03:02.200,00:03:06.000,"One, two, three, four..."
00:03:06.000,00:03:09.520,"Oh, dear."
00:03:09.520,00:03:11.320,...five...
00:03:11.320,00:03:14.480,"George, come over here."
00:03:14.480,00:03:16.520,PEPPA: ...eight...
00:03:17.520,00:03:19.680,"...nine, 10."
00:03:20.880,00:03:23.080,"Ready or not, here I come."
00:03:25.600,00:03:29.000,Oh. George isn't hiding under the table.
00:03:30.240,00:03:33.280,But George always hides under the table.
00:03:33.280,00:03:35.840,Have you thought of looking upstairs?
00:03:37.080,00:03:38.960,I know where he is!
00:03:41.000,00:03:43.560,George is in the toy basket.
00:03:46.960,00:03:48.560,Oh.
00:03:48.560,00:03:50.720,George is not in the toy basket.
00:03:50.720,00:03:52.560,Where can he be?
00:03:56.600,00:03:59.120,Peppa cannot find George anywhere.
00:03:59.120,00:04:03.680,"Daddy, I can't find George anywhere."
00:04:03.680,00:04:07.080,"Oh, dear."
00:04:11.480,00:04:16.400,"Actually, I think there's something about George in this newspaper."
00:04:23.600,00:04:25.960,George! Found you!
00:04:27.560,00:04:30.960,"Oh, George, that was a good place to hide."
00:04:33.200,00:04:36.800,George was hiding behind Daddy Pig's newspaper all the time.
00:04:57.480,00:05:00.640,NARRATOR: Peppa and George are going to the playgroup.
00:05:00.640,00:05:02.520,It is George's first day.
00:05:02.520,00:05:05.400,"George, are you looking forward to the playgroup?"
00:05:06.920,00:05:12.160,"Daddy, maybe George is too small to go to my playgroup."
00:05:12.160,00:05:14.600,"He'll be fine, Peppa."
00:05:14.600,00:05:18.160,There'll be you and Mr. Dinosaur there to keep him company.
00:05:18.160,00:05:20.480,"Grrr, dinosaur."
00:05:22.040,00:05:27.480,"But I want to play with the big children, not George and his toy dinosaur."
00:05:27.480,00:05:31.560,"Oh, dear. Peppa doesn't want George to go to her playgroup."
00:05:37.560,00:05:39.640,We're here.
00:05:39.640,00:05:43.400,"Daddy, are you sure George is big enough?"
00:05:43.400,00:05:45.680,He'll be fine.
00:05:47.240,00:05:49.280,All right.
00:05:49.280,00:05:50.600,He can come.
00:05:51.800,00:05:53.720,Bye-bye.
00:05:59.920,00:06:02.240,"Woof, woof!"
00:06:02.240,00:06:05.640,Madame Gazelle looks after the children at the playgroup.
00:06:05.640,00:06:07.600,Hello!
00:06:07.600,00:06:11.160,"This is my little brother, George."
00:06:12.400,00:06:14.640,"Hello, George."
00:06:24.040,00:06:25.480,Really?
00:06:25.480,00:06:27.560,"Hello, I'm Danny Dog."
00:06:28.800,00:06:30.440,Is that a dinosaur?
00:06:30.440,00:06:33.080,It's just a toy dinosaur.
00:06:33.080,00:06:35.920,"Grrr, dinosaur."
00:06:35.920,00:06:37.200,Brilliant.
00:06:38.640,00:06:41.080,Dinosaur. Grrr.
00:06:43.840,00:06:46.840,Dinosaur. Grrr.
00:06:46.840,00:06:49.600,"Ah, really scary."
00:06:51.200,00:06:53.320,That's brilliant.
00:06:53.320,00:06:55.320,George is my brother.
00:06:55.320,00:06:57.440,He's brilliant.
00:06:58.920,00:07:01.640,Peppa is proud of her little brother George.
00:07:05.280,00:07:09.040,Shall we show George how we paint pictures?
00:07:11.920,00:07:14.040,"Well, maybe you could help him."
00:07:14.040,00:07:16.840,Yes. I'm very good.
00:07:16.840,00:07:19.960,I will show him how to paint a flower.
00:07:19.960,00:07:25.000,"George, today I'm going to teach you how to paint a flower."
00:07:26.640,00:07:29.960,First you paint a big circle.
00:07:33.400,00:07:36.680,"No, George, that's the wrong color."
00:07:37.880,00:07:40.960,Now you paint the flower's petals.
00:07:42.880,00:07:44.320,George!
00:07:44.320,00:07:46.040,That's the wrong shape.
00:07:47.280,00:07:50.520,Now you paint the stalk and the leaves.
00:07:51.720,00:07:54.200,Perfect.
00:07:57.120,00:08:00.160,"George, you've done it all wrong."
00:08:04.240,00:08:06.880,I've painted a flower.
00:08:06.880,00:08:09.120,"MADAME GAZELLE: That's very good, Peppa."
00:08:09.120,00:08:13.360,And George has painted a dinosaur.
00:08:13.360,00:08:16.040,Grrr. Dinosaur.
00:08:18.120,00:08:20.720,Brilliant.
00:08:22.560,00:08:26.480,I think George and Peppa's pictures should go on the wall.
00:08:26.480,00:08:28.600,ALL: Hooray!
00:08:34.400,00:08:37.280,"Yes, I am."
00:08:39.360,00:08:43.880,"It is home time, and the children's parents are here to pick them up."
00:08:43.880,00:08:46.480,Can George come next time?
00:08:46.480,00:08:50.960,Yes. And he can paint us another lovely picture.
00:08:50.960,00:08:54.280,"And what will you paint next time, George?"
00:08:54.280,00:08:56.520,Dinosaur. Grrr.
00:08:56.520,00:08:59.560,Oh! Another dinosaur picture?
00:08:59.560,00:09:03.000,"Well, maybe you can show us all how to paint a dinosaur."
00:09:04.080,00:09:06.240,Brilliant.
00:09:06.240,00:09:08.960,Yes. Brilliant.
00:09:08.960,00:09:10.880,Brilliant.
00:09:29.960,00:09:32.760,NARRATOR: Mommy Pig is working on her computer.
00:09:37.280,00:09:41.440,Daddy Pig is making soup for lunch.
00:09:43.360,00:09:44.680,Daddy?
00:09:44.680,00:09:47.280,Can we go and watch Mommy on her computer?
00:09:47.280,00:09:50.320,"Yes, as long as you don't disturb her."
00:09:50.320,00:09:52.760,She has a lot of important work to do today.
00:09:58.040,00:10:00.640,Mommy Pig has a lot of important work to do.
00:10:03.760,00:10:05.040,Mommy.
00:10:05.040,00:10:08.760,Can George and I sit on your lap and watch you work?
00:10:08.760,00:10:11.200,Yes. If you both sit quietly.
00:10:13.920,00:10:17.200,Peppa and George love to watch Mommy work on the computer.
00:10:19.520,00:10:24.200,"Mommy? Can we play that computer game, Happy Mrs. Chicken?"
00:10:24.200,00:10:26.680,"We can play, Happy Mrs. Chicken later."
00:10:26.680,00:10:28.920,But now I have to work.
00:10:28.920,00:10:31.920,"Mommy, can we help you work?"
00:10:34.840,00:10:38.640,"And George, you mustn't touch the computer either."
00:10:38.640,00:10:41.800,"Yes, George."
00:10:43.680,00:10:45.640,"Peppa, stop!"
00:10:45.640,00:10:47.120,"Sorry, Mommy."
00:10:47.120,00:10:50.600,I was just showing George what not to do.
00:10:53.520,00:10:56.840,"Oh, dear. The computer is not meant to do that."
00:10:56.840,00:10:58.160,Daddy Pig!
00:10:59.440,00:11:01.240,Daddy Pig!
00:11:01.240,00:11:03.200,"What is it, Mommy Pig?"
00:11:07.120,00:11:08.520,Can you mend the computer?
00:11:10.080,00:11:13.200,"I'll finish the lunch, while you mend the computer."
00:11:13.200,00:11:15.840,"Uh...right you are, Mommy Pig."
00:11:18.320,00:11:20.920,"Oh, thank you, Daddy Pig."
00:11:20.920,00:11:23.400,Daddy Pig is going to mend the computer.
00:11:24.480,00:11:26.000,Hmm.
00:11:29.720,00:11:31.720,Hmm.
00:11:33.720,00:11:36.080,Hmm.
00:11:36.080,00:11:39.240,"Um, maybe if I just switch it off..."
00:11:40.520,00:11:42.080,and then switch it on again.
00:11:45.480,00:11:48.000,Daddy Pig has mended the computer.
00:11:48.000,00:11:50.080,"Hooray, Daddy!"
00:11:52.000,00:11:54.480,"Yes, I am a bit of an expert at these things."
00:11:55.640,00:11:57.840,Daddy?
00:11:57.840,00:12:01.640,"Can we play that computer game, Happy Mrs. Chicken?"
00:12:01.640,00:12:03.680,Maybe you should ask Mommy Pig.
00:12:06.560,00:12:07.960,"Well, that's okay, then."

00:08:39.960,00:08:41.320,It's morning.
00:08:41.320,00:08:44.360,What?
00:08:44.360,00:08:46.280,Did the Tooth Fairy come?
00:08:46.280,00:08:47.800,No.
00:08:47.800,00:08:50.200,Let's take a look under your pillow.
00:08:51.920,00:08:53.320,"Look, Peppa!"
00:08:56.840,00:08:58.320,Hooray!
00:09:00.240,00:09:02.840,"You fell asleep, didn't you?"
00:09:02.840,00:09:06.400,"Well, maybe I fell asleep just for a little bit. Oink!"
00:09:06.400,00:09:11.840,Next time I will stay awake and I will see the Tooth Fairy!
00:09:33.720,00:09:35.880,Oink! Shall we have the roof down?
00:09:35.880,00:09:37.120,"Yes, please!"

00:09:57.520,00:09:59.880,And our car loves us too!
00:10:07.040,00:10:10.880,"Oh dear, the car does not sound very well."
00:10:15.040,00:10:16.360,Oink! What's wrong Daddy?
00:10:16.360,00:10:18.920,Hm!
00:10:18.920,00:10:21.840,Oink! Let's take it to Granddad Dog's Garage.
00:10:21.840,00:10:23.040,He can fix it.
00:10:23.040,00:10:25.200,"That's a good idea, Mummy Pig. Oink!"
00:10:28.440,00:10:29.720,Woof!
00:10:31.560,00:10:33.840,He is very good at mending cars.

00:10:39.760,00:10:41.840,Your car does not sound very well.
00:10:43.040,00:10:45.400,"Can you fix it please, Granddad Dog?"
00:10:45.400,00:10:46.440,Yes...
00:10:46.440,00:10:49.440,but it will take all day.
00:10:49.440,00:10:50.800,Oh...
00:10:50.800,00:10:53.440,Oink! We wanted to go for a drive in our car.
00:10:53.440,00:10:55.080,Woof!
00:10:57.600,00:10:59.000,Hurrah!
00:11:00.000,00:11:01.000,"Thank you, Granddad Dog."
00:11:01.000,00:11:02.240,Would you like the roof down?
00:11:02.240,00:11:04.160,"Oink! Yes, please!"
00:11:04.160,00:11:07.280,I'll just press this red button.
00:11:08.560,00:11:10.160,What a clever car!
00:11:11.600,00:11:15.000,Woof! When you come back I will have fixed your car.
00:11:15.000,00:11:17.000,"Thank you, Grandad Dog."

00:11:20.240,00:11:22.200,Goodbye!
00:11:23.720,00:11:27.000,Peppa and her family like the new blue car.
00:11:27.000,00:11:29.440,There are so many buttons in this new car.
00:11:29.440,00:11:32.680,"PEPPA: Oink! What does the green button do, Daddy?"
00:11:32.680,00:11:34.200,Let's see.
00:11:35.120,00:11:37.640,Magic windows!
00:11:39.600,00:11:42.600,Daddy! Make the magic windows go down.
00:11:45.760,00:11:48.080,Oink! What does the blue button do?
00:11:48.080,00:11:51.080,I don't know.
00:11:54.480,00:11:56.280,Ah!
00:11:59.200,00:12:00.800,Oink! I love this new car.
00:12:00.800,00:12:02.400,Can we keep it?
00:12:02.400,00:12:04.480,"No, we can't keep it, Peppa."
00:12:04.480,00:12:06.680,We've only borrowed it for today.
00:12:09.280,00:12:11.560,"Oh no, I think it's going to rain."
00:12:11.560,00:12:15.680,"Yes, I'll just put the roof up. Oink!"
00:12:15.680,00:12:19.160,"Now, which is the button to close the roof?"
00:12:21.800,00:12:24.160,Oops! Silly Me.
00:12:24.160,00:12:27.120,"Ah ha, this must be the button."
00:12:27.760,00:12:29.240,Argh!
00:12:29.240,00:12:32.240,The new car has squirted Daddy Pig with water.
00:12:33.360,00:12:34.880,"Silly Daddy, that's not the roof!"
00:12:34.880,00:12:36.200,This button!
00:12:36.200,00:12:37.160,Oops! Not that one.
00:12:37.160,00:12:38.360,This button!
00:12:41.160,00:12:42.760,Help!
00:12:46.160,00:12:48.440,I don't think this car likes me!
00:12:48.440,00:12:50.800,Let's try the red button.
00:12:56.080,00:12:58.160,But now it's stopped raining.
00:12:58.160,00:13:00.520,Oink! Can we open the roof again?
00:13:00.520,00:13:02.240,"Er, yes."
00:13:02.240,00:13:03.720,Which button was it?
00:13:06.600,00:13:08.160,Hurray!
00:13:10.560,00:13:15.560,Granddad Dog has fixed the car.
00:13:15.560,00:13:17.680,Your car is fixed. Woof!
00:13:17.680,00:13:19.120,Hurray!
00:13:19.120,00:13:22.200,"Thank you Granddad Dog, and keep the change."
00:13:23.800,00:13:25.600,Woof! Woof! Goodbye!
00:13:25.600,00:13:26.680,Oink! Goodbye.
00:13:26.680,00:13:27.680,Goodbye.
00:13:27.680,00:13:29.840,Bye-bye.
00:13:31.760,00:13:34.920,Ah! It's good to get our old car back again! Oink!
00:13:38.920,00:13:41.480,And I think our old car likes us too.
00:13:41.480,00:13:42.640,Don't you?

00:15:21.640,00:15:24.840,Er. It is a bit difficult.
00:15:24.840,00:15:29.200,"Daddy Pig, you're holding the map upside down!"
00:15:29.200,00:15:32.240,"Yes, I thought as much. Oink!"
00:15:32.240,00:15:34.320,PEPPA: It's easy!
00:15:34.320,00:15:37.320,The red cross shows where the treasure is!
00:15:37.320,00:15:41.360,DADDY: But where in the garden are those two apple trees?
00:15:41.360,00:15:43.520,"Hmm, I don't know."
00:15:43.520,00:15:45.000,Would you like a clue?
00:15:45.000,00:15:46.960,Yes please!
00:15:46.960,00:15:49.480,The first clue is in a bottle.
00:15:49.480,00:15:52.000,Oink!
00:15:52.000,00:15:54.600,Oink! I can see it!

00:16:01.000,00:16:02.640,A message in a bottle.
00:16:02.640,00:16:05.120,Oink! Look everyone!
00:16:05.120,00:16:06.160,Oink! Oink!
00:16:06.160,00:16:07.560,"Well done, Peppa! Oink!"
00:16:07.560,00:16:09.640,Let's see what the message says.
00:16:09.640,00:16:13.360,"Oh, it's a message from a pirate!"
00:16:13.360,00:16:17.360,Mummy? Can you read the pirate's message?
00:16:17.360,00:16:21.640,Hmm. This pirate has very bad handwriting...
00:16:21.640,00:16:24.480,The pirate's handwriting is excellent.
00:16:24.480,00:16:26.960,"No, I can't make it out at all."
00:16:26.960,00:16:32.240,"The pirate has clearly written, “Follow the arrows!” Follow the arrows?"
00:16:36.000,00:16:38.160,Sticks in the shape of an arrow!
00:16:38.160,00:16:39.920,Look! They point this way!
00:16:41.400,00:16:44.680,Peppa and George are following the arrows.
00:16:47.480,00:16:48.880,PEPPA: Look George! A key!
00:16:48.880,00:16:51.840,Peppa has found the next clue.
00:16:53.960,00:16:58.680,Now you just have to find the treasure chest that it unlocks.
00:16:58.680,00:17:01.680,But there aren't any more clues.
00:17:01.680,00:17:04.720,Maybe you should take another look at the map...
00:17:04.720,00:17:08.440,"Look Peppa, the map has two apple trees on it."
00:17:11.640,00:17:13.160,And here's an apple tree!
00:17:13.160,00:17:14.480,Oink! Oink!
00:17:14.480,00:17:18.160,So the treasure must be here!
00:17:25.040,00:17:28.640,Oh dear. There doesn't seem to be anything here...
00:17:31.040,00:17:32.080,Hang on!
00:17:32.080,00:17:33.480,There is something here!

00:17:43.600,00:17:45.480,Wow! I can't believe it!
00:17:45.480,00:17:47.480,Gold coins!
00:17:47.480,00:17:49.480,They must be worth a fortune!
00:17:51.440,00:17:56.680,"They are not gold coins, they are chocolate coins!"
00:17:56.680,00:17:59.880,And there's a chocolate coin for everybody.
00:17:59.880,00:18:00.920,ALL: Hurray!
00:18:02.280,00:18:04.560,Peppa and George love chocolate coins.

00:00:28.480,00:00:31.080,Oink! Breakfast is ready!
00:00:34.360,00:00:36.200,Oink!
00:00:38.680,00:00:42.720,"Mummy, I don't feel very well. Oink!"
00:00:42.720,00:00:44.080,"Oh dear, Peppa."
00:00:44.080,00:00:45.720,You don't look very well.
00:00:45.720,00:00:47.040,Oink! Don't worry.
00:00:47.040,00:00:48.960,I'll ring Doctor Brown-Bear.
00:00:52.360,00:00:54.120,Doctor Brown-Bear speaking.
00:00:56.080,00:00:58.640,Her face is covered in red spots!
00:00:58.640,00:01:03.600,Hmm. Put Peppa to bed and I'll come straight round.
00:01:05.800,00:01:08.640,Doctor Brown-Bear has come to make Peppa better.
00:01:11.760,00:01:13.320,I am not very well.
00:01:13.320,00:01:16.200,"Stick your tongue out, please."
00:01:16.200,00:01:19.480,Hmm. It's not anything serious.
00:01:19.480,00:01:21.560,Peppa has just got a rash.
00:01:21.560,00:01:23.360,Oink!
00:01:25.120,00:01:29.000,"But if you like, I can give you just a little medicine."
00:01:29.000,00:01:31.160,"Yes, please."
00:01:31.160,00:01:33.920,I'm afraid it doesn't taste very nice.
00:01:33.920,00:01:35.640,Open wide please.
00:01:36.600,00:01:39.680,Yuck! Disgusting!
00:01:39.680,00:01:45.000,You are a brave little one for taking it so well.
00:01:45.000,00:01:46.400,Peppa must stay in bed.
00:01:46.400,00:01:49.520,I'll call back later to check that she is better.
00:01:49.520,00:01:51.200,Oink!
00:01:51.200,00:01:53.880,"Oh yes, she can have visitors."
00:01:53.880,00:01:56.160,The rash isn't catching.
00:01:56.160,00:01:57.280,Goodbye!
00:01:57.280,00:01:59.560,Oink!
00:01:59.560,00:02:01.880,"Mummy, can I get up now?"
00:02:01.880,00:02:05.240,Doctor Brown-Bear says that you must stay in bed for a little bit Peppa.
00:02:05.240,00:02:08.160,But it's so boring!
00:02:08.160,00:02:10.640,Doctor Brown-Bear did say you could have visitors.
00:02:10.640,00:02:13.080,Oink!

00:02:34.480,00:02:36.560,Has the doctor been?
00:02:36.560,00:02:38.400,"Yes, Doctor Brown-Bear was here!"
00:02:38.400,00:02:42.600,He said I was not very well and that I was very brave.
00:02:42.600,00:02:44.560,So are you really ill?
00:02:47.080,00:02:49.440,I have to stay in bed! Oink!
00:02:49.440,00:02:54.160,Doctor Brown-Bear gave me medicine that tasted really horrible!
00:02:54.160,00:02:56.880,I'm coming to see you! Bleat!
00:02:56.880,00:03:00.000,I'm going to wear my nurse's outfit!
00:03:00.000,00:03:03.200,Suzy Sheep has come to see Peppa.
00:03:03.200,00:03:04.920,Suzy is wearing her nurse's costume.
00:03:06.440,00:03:10.320,Danny Dog and Rebecca Rabbit have come along too.
00:03:12.400,00:03:13.360,Hello Peppa!
00:03:13.360,00:03:15.520,Oink! Hello!
00:03:15.520,00:03:18.000,Bleat!
00:03:18.000,00:03:20.520,"I am not very well, Suzy."
00:03:20.520,00:03:22.080,I have to stay in bed.
00:03:22.080,00:03:24.520,What can we do to make you better?
00:03:24.520,00:03:27.880,Oink! You could get me some orange juice.
00:03:27.880,00:03:29.080,Okay!
00:03:30.440,00:03:33.400,Peppa seems to be quite enjoying herself.
00:03:34.840,00:03:36.560,"Thank you, Suzy."
00:03:37.680,00:03:39.360,Do you feel any better?
00:03:39.360,00:03:42.680,A little bit. Oink!
00:03:42.680,00:03:44.040,Woof!
00:03:44.040,00:03:46.840,Ask my mummy if I could have some ice cream.
00:03:46.840,00:03:51.440,"And Rebecca, could you bring me some flowers from the garden?"
00:03:51.440,00:03:54.920,"Doctor Brown-Bear is here, to see if Peppa is better."
00:03:54.920,00:03:57.800,"Ah good, the nurse is already here!"
00:03:57.800,00:03:59.400,How is the patient?
00:04:04.120,00:04:06.080,I see.
00:04:06.080,00:04:08.280,Would you like me to take a look myself?
00:04:08.280,00:04:09.640,"Yes, please."
00:04:09.640,00:04:13.680,I say!
00:04:13.680,00:04:15.400,You're completely better!
00:04:15.400,00:04:17.400,Aren't I still a bit ill?
00:04:18.800,00:04:22.040,I think I should stay in bed a little bit more.
00:04:22.040,00:04:24.040,Hm. Oink!
00:04:24.040,00:04:27.760,"I fancy a game with this ball, in the garden!!"
00:04:27.760,00:04:29.080,Who wants to join me?
00:04:29.080,00:04:30.240,Me! Me! Me!
00:04:30.240,00:04:31.920,"Me, too! Oink! Oink!"
00:04:33.240,00:04:37.200,Well I never!
00:04:58.000,00:05:00.800,Peppa and George are very exited today.
00:05:00.800,00:05:03.040,It is snowing outside!
00:05:03.040,00:05:06.040,Oink! Mummy! Can we go and play in the snow?
00:05:06.040,00:05:08.520,Oink! Yes.
00:05:06.040,00:05:09.640,"But it's very cold outside, so you must wrap up warm."
00:05:09.640,00:05:10.720,Hurrah!
00:05:12.320,00:05:16.280,"And don't forget to wear your hats, and scarves and gloves."
00:05:17.880,00:05:19.320,It is very cold outside.
00:05:19.320,00:05:27.800,"Peppa and George must wear their hats, and scarves, and gloves."
00:05:29.000,00:05:30.120,Oink!
00:05:33.120,00:05:35.680,Peppa and George are making footprints in the snow.
00:05:38.480,00:05:41.920,Peppa and George love making footprints in the snow!
00:06:03.760,00:06:05.080,Oink!
00:06:05.080,00:06:08.280,"George, let's play snowballs!"
00:06:12.000,00:06:14.360,Peppa has made a snowball.
00:06:26.000,00:06:28.840,Peppa and George are having a lot of fun.
00:06:30.760,00:06:41.880,"George, come back, you little piggy Oink! Oink!"
00:06:41.880,00:06:43.720,Ah! Oink!
00:06:49.160,00:06:52.240,Oink!
00:06:55.160,00:06:58.960,"Oh, dear. Maybe this game is getting a little too rough."
00:06:58.960,00:07:00.800,Oink!
00:07:02.800,00:07:05.600,George!
00:07:05.600,00:07:06.840,Oink!
00:07:08.560,00:07:10.880,Peppa and George are making a snowman.
00:07:10.880,00:07:12.920,First they make the body.
00:07:12.920,00:07:17.720,"Oink! George, this is the snowman's body."
00:07:17.720,00:07:19.680,"Now, they make the snowman's head."
00:07:22.000,00:07:26.120,Oink! Now he needs some arms and eyes and a mouth!
00:07:29.400,00:07:33.400,George has found some sticks for the snowman's arms.
00:07:33.400,00:07:36.920,Peppa has found some stones for the snowman's eyes and mouth.
00:07:38.040,00:07:40.120,This is his face.
00:07:40.120,00:07:41.360,Oink!
00:07:41.360,00:07:43.640,Now the snowman needs a nose.
00:07:46.680,00:07:50.480,"Peppa has got a carrot, to make the snowman's nose."
00:07:50.480,00:07:52.280,Oink! Oink!
00:07:52.280,00:07:54.400,The snowman looks very happy.
00:07:54.400,00:07:56.960,But maybe he is bit cold.
00:07:56.960,00:08:00.800,"Oink! The snowman needs some clothes, to keep him warm."
00:08:12.360,00:08:18.480,"The snowman is wearing his hat, and scarf, and gloves."
00:08:18.480,00:08:20.360,Mummy! Daddy!
00:08:20.360,00:08:22.080,Oink! Come and look!
00:08:22.080,00:08:24.120,Oink! Oink!
00:08:24.120,00:08:27.760,Mummy is wearing her hat and scarf and gloves.
00:08:27.760,00:08:32.760,Oink! That is the best snowman I have ever seen!
00:08:37.280,00:08:39.280,Daddy Pig looks quite cold.
00:08:39.280,00:08:42.560,He isn't wearing his hat and scarf and gloves.
00:08:44.360,00:08:49.800,"Daddy, why aren't you wearing your hat, and scarf and gloves?"
00:08:52.200,00:08:53.960,I can't find them anywhere!
00:08:53.960,00:08:58.640,"Oink! I think I know where Daddy's hat, scarf and gloves are."
00:08:58.640,00:09:02.160,Daddy Pig's hat and scarf and gloves are on the Snowman!
00:09:02.160,00:09:03.440,Oh!
00:09:23.360,00:09:26.080,Peppa and her family are going out for the day.
00:09:26.080,00:09:28.160,"Oink! Peppa, George."
00:09:30.520,00:09:32.800,"What's Windy Castle, Daddy?"
00:09:32.800,00:09:35.040,"It's a castle, on a very high hill!"
00:09:35.040,00:09:36.000,Oink! Oink!
00:09:36.000,00:09:37.640,George likes castles.
00:09:37.640,00:09:41.560,Oink! Windy Castle sounds like a boring thing for boys.
00:09:41.560,00:09:44.000,"No Peppa, you'll love it."
00:09:44.000,00:09:46.280,There's a great view from the top of Windy Castle.
00:09:46.280,00:09:48.800,You can even see Granny and Grandpa's house!
00:09:48.800,00:09:50.440,Wow! Let's go!
00:09:51.680,00:09:54.800,I'll map-read and Mummy Pig will drive.
00:09:56.400,00:09:59.280,When you map-read we always get lost and you get grumpy.
00:09:59.280,00:10:03.440,Oink! We will not get lost and I will not get grumpy.
00:10:06.040,00:10:08.200,"Windy Castle, here we come!"
00:10:13.040,00:10:14.600,Are we nearly there yet?
00:10:14.600,00:10:16.200,Not quite.
00:10:16.200,00:10:17.240,Oh.
00:10:18.800,00:10:20.360,"Yes, please. Oink!"
00:10:20.360,00:10:23.880,Let's play “I Spy!” Okay.
00:10:28.680,00:10:32.720,"I spy with my little eye, something colored red."
00:10:32.720,00:10:37.080,Red? Oink!
00:10:37.080,00:10:39.400,No. It's not your dress.
00:10:39.400,00:10:40.880,Hmm.
00:10:40.880,00:10:42.000,The car!
00:10:46.640,00:10:48.040,My go.
00:10:48.040,00:10:51.640,"I spy with my little eye, something blue."
00:10:51.640,00:10:54.000,"DADDY PIG: Hm, George's blue shirt!"
00:10:57.600,00:10:59.960,No. Give up?
00:10:59.960,00:11:02.720,The sky! The blue sky! Oink!
00:11:02.720,00:11:03.720,I win.
00:11:05.240,00:11:07.960,Daddy Pig?
00:11:07.960,00:11:09.920,I know exactly where we are.
00:11:09.920,00:11:11.400,Although...
00:11:11.400,00:11:14.960,This road doesn't look the same as it does on the map.
00:11:14.960,00:11:17.360,"Oh, Daddy Pig! Oink!"
00:11:20.240,00:11:22.960,So how do we get to Windy Castle from here?
00:11:22.960,00:11:25.560,Just give me a moment.
00:11:25.560,00:11:26.800,Hm!
00:11:26.800,00:11:29.120,"I know, we can ring Granny and Grandpa."
00:11:32.080,00:11:34.760,"I'll get us to Windy Castle, if it takes me all day."
00:11:34.760,00:11:36.960,We haven't got all day.
00:11:41.120,00:11:44.280,Hello.
00:11:44.280,00:11:48.840,"Grandpa Pig, we've got a bit lost on the way to Windy Castle."
00:11:49.920,00:11:52.520,Is Daddy Pig doing the map-reading?
00:11:52.520,00:11:55.280,"Yes, Daddy Pig is doing the map-reading."
00:11:57.400,00:11:59.480,I am not grumpy. Oink!
00:12:00.960,00:12:02.720,Oink!
00:12:08.160,00:12:10.080,Thank you Grandpa Pig.
00:12:10.080,00:12:13.680,We follow the main road and look out for Windy Castle.
00:12:13.680,00:12:14.840,As I thought.
00:12:16.440,00:12:17.920,Look!
00:12:17.920,00:12:19.400,Is that a castle?
00:12:19.400,00:12:22.120,DADDY PIG: Yes! It's Windy Castle!
00:12:23.560,00:12:24.680,Come on car!
00:12:24.680,00:12:28.560,Come on car!
00:12:29.440,00:12:31.000,Hurray!
00:12:31.000,00:12:33.760,Peppa and her family have arrived at Windy Castle.
00:12:33.760,00:12:36.000,Wow!
00:12:36.000,00:12:37.840,Oink! Oink!
00:12:37.840,00:12:40.560,The view from the top is fantastic!
00:12:45.240,00:12:46.440,CHILDREN: Wow!
00:12:46.440,00:12:48.560,MUMMY PIG: Look at the view!
00:12:48.560,00:12:52.520,"PEPPA: Mummy, is that Granny and Grandpa's house?"
00:12:52.520,00:12:53.920,"MUMMY PIG: Yes, it is!"
00:12:53.920,00:12:56.520,PEPPA: It's so far away!
00:12:56.520,00:12:59.080,Let's take a look through the telescope.
00:13:02.680,00:13:05.480,"Yes, but you must let George look next."
00:13:05.480,00:13:06.880,Wow!
00:13:06.880,00:13:09.320,The telescope makes everything look bigger.
00:13:09.320,00:13:12.640,PEPPA: I can see Granny and Grandpa!
00:13:12.640,00:13:13.680,Look George!
00:13:13.680,00:13:15.760,Oink!
00:13:15.760,00:13:18.440,GEORGE: Gangy 'ig!
00:13:18.440,00:13:21.400,George is waving at Granny and Grandpa Pig.
00:13:21.400,00:13:23.280,Silly George! Oink!
00:13:23.280,00:13:27.320,Granny and Grandpa are too far away to see you waving!
00:13:27.320,00:13:29.520,I know!
00:13:32.600,00:13:33.520,Hello?
00:13:33.520,00:13:38.120,MUMMY PIG: Grandpa Pig! We can see you from Windy Castle!
00:13:38.120,00:13:41.240,GEORGE: Granny and Grandpa are waving at us!
00:13:42.280,00:13:45.440,I love Windy Castle!
00:13:54.840,00:13:58.200,Peppa and George are playing in the garden.
00:13:58.200,00:14:00.800,"Too me, George."
00:14:00.800,00:14:03.400,You threw the ball too hard George!
00:14:03.400,00:14:05.920,So the rules say I win! Oink!
00:14:05.920,00:14:08.400,Now it's my turn.
00:14:10.520,00:14:11.560,I win again!
00:14:11.560,00:14:13.000,"Peppa, George."
00:14:13.000,00:14:15.640,"Today your big cousin, Chloé is coming to visit!"
00:14:15.640,00:14:17.400,Yippee! Cousin Chloé!
00:14:17.400,00:14:18.600,Oink! Oink!
00:14:18.600,00:14:21.520,"George, Chloé is a big girl, like me."
00:14:21.520,00:14:26.360,"So, don't be sad if she finds you too little to play with."
00:14:26.360,00:14:29.560,I'm sure Chloé will play with both of you.
00:14:30.600,00:14:32.240,Chloé's here! Oink!
00:14:32.240,00:14:35.920,Aunty Pig has brought Chloé to spend the day at Peppa's house.
00:14:35.920,00:14:38.600,Chloé is Peppa and George's cousin.
00:14:38.600,00:14:41.080,Chloé is a bit older than Peppa and George.
00:14:43.120,00:14:45.400,Hello Peppa! Hello George!
00:14:45.400,00:14:47.760,See you later!
00:14:47.760,00:14:49.360,Do you want to play a game?
00:14:49.360,00:14:51.400,Oink! Yes!
00:14:51.400,00:14:53.640,Peppa loves playing Catch.
00:14:53.640,00:14:55.160,Do you still play Catch?
00:14:55.160,00:14:57.280,That's a game for little children.
00:14:57.280,00:15:02.040,Oh. We only play Catch because George likes it.
00:15:02.040,00:15:04.440,Okay. Let's play it for George.
00:15:04.440,00:15:08.120,Do you play with proper rules or the baby rules?
00:15:08.120,00:15:09.560,Proper rules!
00:15:09.560,00:15:12.480,I'll start. Oink!
00:15:12.480,00:15:14.400,Catch me if you can!
00:15:14.400,00:15:15.400,Oink!
00:15:15.400,00:15:16.640,Peppa is it.
00:15:16.640,00:15:18.760,She has to chase Chloé and George.
00:15:18.760,00:15:21.160,Can't catch me!
00:15:23.760,00:15:25.200,You're so little!
00:15:26.280,00:15:28.320,Oink! That's not fair!
00:15:30.000,00:15:31.800,That's because he's little.
00:15:31.800,00:15:33.720,Oink!
00:15:33.720,00:15:35.480,No! I don't need help.
00:15:35.480,00:15:37.240,I'm a big girl like you.
00:15:37.240,00:15:39.880,"Come on then, Peppa!"
00:15:40.920,00:15:42.440,Can't catch us!
00:15:44.480,00:15:46.200,Can't catch us!
00:15:46.200,00:15:47.680,This is a silly game.
00:15:47.680,00:15:49.280,Can we play something else?
00:15:49.280,00:15:53.200,"Okay, I know a really good game, for big children."
00:15:53.200,00:15:55.560,It's called Sly Fox!
00:15:55.560,00:15:59.480,Sly Fox?
00:15:59.480,00:16:01.560,What is it?
00:16:01.560,00:16:05.200,One person is the “Sly Fox”.
00:16:05.200,00:16:07.080,And the others creep up on them.
00:16:08.240,00:16:10.240,I want to be the “Sly Fox”!
00:16:10.240,00:16:12.040,Peppa is the Sly Fox.
00:16:12.040,00:16:15.080,"While her back is turned, the others creep up on her."
00:16:15.080,00:16:20.600,"But if Peppa turns and sees someone move, they have to go back to the start!"
00:16:20.600,00:16:23.560,George! I saw you move!
00:16:25.520,00:16:27.840,Got you! I win!
00:16:27.840,00:16:30.120,You moved before I was ready!
00:16:30.120,00:16:32.120,The rules say I can move when I like.
00:16:32.120,00:16:33.320,Don't they George?
00:16:33.320,00:16:34.640,Oink! Oink!
00:16:34.640,00:16:37.960,Now it's Chloé's turn to be the sly fox.
00:16:40.640,00:16:43.400,Peppa and George must stay very still.
00:16:46.440,00:16:47.960,Peppa!
00:16:47.960,00:16:49.240,Back to the start!
00:16:49.240,00:16:52.520,Oink! It's not fair!
00:16:52.520,00:16:55.600,"The rules say, I can look as long as I want."
00:16:55.600,00:16:57.280,Oink! Back to the start.
00:16:59.680,00:17:01.040,George is the winner!
00:17:02.480,00:17:04.160,Can we play a different game?
00:17:04.160,00:17:07.240,Yes. Oink! But as long as it's a grown-up game.
00:17:07.240,00:17:10.640,I know! Oink!
00:17:10.640,00:17:13.120,It's very grown-up!
00:17:13.120,00:17:16.200,"George, do you know what Peppa's favorite game is?"
00:17:16.200,00:17:17.240,Oink! Oink!
00:17:17.240,00:17:20.840,Peppa's favorite game is jumping up and down in muddy puddles!
00:17:24.280,00:17:25.560,Oink!
00:17:25.560,00:17:29.400,"I've brought some boots for you too, Chloé!"
00:17:29.400,00:17:32.760,I'm too grown-up to jump in muddy puddles.
00:17:32.760,00:17:35.280,Oh. So am I.
00:17:36.520,00:17:42.400,"George loves jumping in muddy puddles Secretly, Peppa would love to jump in the puddle."
00:17:42.400,00:17:44.360,But she wants to look grown-up.
00:17:44.360,00:17:47.640,I hear there's some puddle jumping going on!
00:17:47.640,00:17:51.880,Mummy and Daddy Pig love jumping in muddy puddles!
00:17:51.880,00:17:53.800,It does look fun.
00:17:53.800,00:17:56.280,"Yes, it does."
00:17:58.200,00:18:02.280,"Maybe there's a rule that says, big girls can jump in muddy puddles."
00:18:02.280,00:18:04.360,Yes!
00:18:05.440,00:18:06.920,Race you!
00:18:06.920,00:18:08.520,Race you!
00:18:08.520,00:18:12.160,Peppa and Chloé love jumping in muddy puddles!
00:00:24.880,00:00:26.400,NARRATOR: It is teatime.
00:00:26.400,00:00:28.720,And Mommy Pig has a surprise for everyone.
00:00:28.720,00:00:31.480,Today is a day for pancakes.
00:00:31.480,00:00:34.120,Pancakes. Delicious.
00:00:35.280,00:00:37.480,I love pancakes.
00:00:39.960,00:00:41.680,Everyone loves pancakes.
00:00:41.680,00:00:44.720,I'm the expert at flipping the pancakes over.
00:00:44.720,00:00:46.000,Leave that to me.
00:00:46.000,00:00:47.720,"Are you sure, Daddy Pig?"
00:00:47.720,00:00:51.640,Last time you got a bit grumpy when you dropped the pancake on the floor.
00:00:51.640,00:00:53.440,I did not get grumpy.
00:00:53.440,00:00:56.240,There was a problem with the frying pan.
00:00:58.080,00:01:01.720,"Mommy, can we help make the pancakes? Please?"
00:01:01.720,00:01:03.320,Yes.
00:01:03.320,00:01:05.520,You can help me make the batter.
00:01:05.520,00:01:09.040,First I put some flour in the bowl.
00:01:09.040,00:01:10.680,BOTH: Ooh.
00:01:10.680,00:01:13.200,MOMMY PIG: Now I add an egg.
00:01:14.640,00:01:16.440,Now the milk.
00:01:17.840,00:01:19.880,And I give it all a stir.
00:01:20.760,00:01:22.720,"Mommy, can I stir?"
00:01:22.720,00:01:24.400,"Yes, of course, Peppa."
00:01:24.400,00:01:26.800,Peppa loves stirring.
00:01:28.040,00:01:29.760,George wants to stir as well.
00:01:38.160,00:01:40.160,"Okay, that's enough stirring."
00:01:40.160,00:01:43.320,You two sit at the table while I cook the pancakes.
00:01:52.200,00:01:55.160,Mommy Pig is going to flip the pancake over.
00:01:56.320,00:01:58.240,Hooray!
00:01:58.240,00:02:00.440,"You could flip it higher, Mommy Pig."
00:02:00.440,00:02:04.760,"You can show us how when you flip your own pancake, Daddy Pig."
00:02:04.760,00:02:07.120,This first pancake is for George.
00:02:07.120,00:02:10.000,Mommy Pig pours a little syrup on George's pancake.
00:02:13.080,00:02:14.840,Delicious.
00:02:16.760,00:02:18.840,This pancake is for Peppa.
00:02:19.800,00:02:21.160,PEPPA: Hooray!
00:02:22.480,00:02:25.600,"Hmm. You could flip it higher, Mommy Pig."
00:02:25.600,00:02:30.080,"MOMMY PIG: You will get a chance to show me when you flip you own pancake, Daddy Pig."
00:02:30.080,00:02:31.800,"Syrup, please."
00:02:40.400,00:02:42.760,This pancake is for Mommy Pig.
00:02:43.880,00:02:45.200,PEPPA: Hooray!
00:02:46.800,00:02:49.800,"You still aren't flipping them high enough, Mommy Pig."
00:02:49.800,00:02:52.320,"The next pancake is yours, Daddy Pig."
00:02:52.320,00:02:55.040,So now you can show us how it should be done.
00:02:58.280,00:03:00.520,Delicious.
00:03:01.880,00:03:04.680,Is everyone watching?
00:03:04.680,00:03:11.800,The secret of making a good pancake is to flip it high into the air.
00:03:11.800,00:03:15.480,"One, two, three..."
00:03:15.480,00:03:16.920,hoopla!
00:03:20.960,00:03:22.960,Silly Daddy.
00:03:22.960,00:03:25.880,Maybe that was just a bit too high.
00:03:25.880,00:03:28.920,"Oh, what a shame."
00:03:28.920,00:03:31.560,It should be a simple matter to get it down.
00:03:33.920,00:03:36.760,"Oh, dear. Daddy Pig cannot reach his pancake."
00:03:38.720,00:03:40.880,I think I know a way to get it down.
00:03:40.880,00:03:42.800,"Let's go upstairs, children."
00:03:44.000,00:03:45.600,This way.
00:03:46.800,00:03:49.400,What is Mommy Pig planning to do?
00:03:53.680,00:03:55.920,"One, two, three."
00:03:55.920,00:03:58.400,Jump!
00:04:02.160,00:04:04.520,What are they doing?
00:04:12.400,00:04:13.760,It worked.
00:04:18.000,00:04:20.960,Hmm.
00:04:20.960,00:04:23.080,"Syrup on your pancake, Daddy Pig?"
00:04:23.080,00:04:24.720,"Yes, please."
00:04:27.920,00:04:31.400,"One, two, three..."
00:04:31.400,00:04:32.960,hoopla!
00:04:36.880,00:04:39.240,Delicious.
00:04:41.280,00:04:42.800,Silly Daddy.
00:04:56.040,00:04:59.520,NARRATOR: Mommy Pig and Daddy Pig are going out for the evening.
00:04:59.520,00:05:02.320,Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig are going to babysit.
00:05:02.320,00:05:04.920,Granny Pig! Grandpa Pig!
00:05:04.920,00:05:07.520,Granny Pig! Grandpa Pig!
00:05:07.520,00:05:09.560,"Hello, my little ones."
00:05:09.560,00:05:11.240,Hello.
00:05:11.240,00:05:13.600,"Peppa, George, into your beds, quick."
00:05:15.760,00:05:18.000,"Good night, my little piggies."
00:05:18.000,00:05:19.880,Good night. Sleep tight.
00:05:19.880,00:05:23.160,"Good night, Mommy."
00:05:26.520,00:05:28.560,Now go to sleep quickly.
00:05:28.560,00:05:29.840,"Yes, Mommy."
00:05:29.840,00:05:31.960,So well-behaved.
00:05:34.160,00:05:37.360,Mommy Pig and Daddy Pig are leaving for their evening out.
00:05:49.000,00:05:51.400,Peppa and George are so good.
00:05:51.400,00:05:54.680,They just fell asleep when Mommy Pig told them to.
00:05:54.680,00:05:57.760,This babysitting is easy.
00:06:00.920,00:06:03.640,George? George?
00:06:03.640,00:06:05.360,Are you awake?
00:06:24.160,00:06:26.640,What strange noises.
00:06:38.240,00:06:40.040,"Peppa, George."
00:06:40.040,00:06:42.000,Are you awake?
00:06:46.240,00:06:47.960,"Well, I never."
00:06:49.600,00:06:55.440,So it wasn't Peppa and George making all that noise.
00:07:01.760,00:07:05.040,I can't hear anything.
00:07:05.040,00:07:07.400,I think they really have fallen asleep.
00:07:07.400,00:07:10.960,Let's watch some television.
00:07:10.960,00:07:12.440,Gardening.
00:07:12.440,00:07:14.920,"Today, we are talking about roses."
00:07:14.920,00:07:18.560,"Oh, I love gardening programs."
00:07:18.560,00:07:22.120,The Kiftsgate is a particularly thorny rose.
00:07:23.560,00:07:30.320,"To prune it, start by lopping off the head and then snip away the budding shoots."
00:07:30.320,00:07:31.960,Granny Pig?
00:07:31.960,00:07:33.560,GRANNY PIG: Peppa? George?
00:07:33.560,00:07:35.720,You should be in bed asleep.
00:07:35.720,00:07:38.120,George and I aren't sleepy at all.
00:07:38.120,00:07:41.160,Can we watch TV with you?
00:07:41.160,00:07:44.960,"Well, I suppose watching a little TV might make you sleepy."
00:07:44.960,00:07:46.560,Hooray!
00:07:47.760,00:07:55.960,"Icelandic Roses are a rare treat for the discerning horticulturist, but they are prone to lobbing in temperate habitats."
00:08:00.440,00:08:05.480,"Grandpa Pig, can you play that game where you throw us up and catch us?"
00:08:05.480,00:08:08.880,"Okay, but just one turn each."
00:08:10.040,00:08:11.400,Whee!
00:08:12.640,00:08:14.720,"Oh, you seem heavier than before."
00:08:19.360,00:08:20.680,Whee!
00:08:22.000,00:08:23.320,My turn.
00:08:23.320,00:08:24.680,Whee!
00:08:24.680,00:08:27.200,Whew.
00:08:27.200,00:08:28.440,Whee!
00:08:28.440,00:08:31.000,Maybe Grandpa Pig is a bit tired.
00:08:31.000,00:08:35.080,"I know. Granny Pig, let's play catch."
00:08:36.280,00:08:37.760,You're it.
00:08:37.760,00:08:39.400,Catch us if you can.
00:08:40.640,00:08:42.000,PEPPA: Can't catch me.
00:08:52.320,00:08:55.080,NARRATOR: Mommy Pig and Daddy Pig are back home.
00:08:55.080,00:08:57.880,I hope our little piggies are asleep.
00:08:59.600,00:09:01.800,Hello? Anyone here?
00:09:06.280,00:09:08.200,The little piggies are asleep.
00:09:08.200,00:09:10.440,And so are the big piggies.
00:09:24.640,00:09:27.800,NARRATOR: Peppa is going to her first ballet lesson.
00:09:27.800,00:09:30.320,"This is Madame Gazelle, the ballet teacher."
00:09:30.320,00:09:33.080,"Oh, you must be young Peppa."
00:09:33.080,00:09:36.800,I am Madame Gazelle.
00:09:39.080,00:09:40.960,"Hello, Madame."
00:09:44.360,00:09:49.800,Welcome to your first lesson of the ballet.
00:09:51.000,00:09:52.440,I'll pick you up later.
00:09:55.120,00:10:02.800,"Here are Peppa's friends, Candy Cat, Suzy Sheep, Danny Dog, Rebecca Rabbit and Pedro Pony."
00:10:02.800,00:10:08.480,"Children, today we have a new pupil: Peppa Pig."
00:10:08.480,00:10:10.640,"Now, Peppa, run and join your friends."
00:10:12.560,00:10:15.000,"Hello, everyone."
00:10:17.680,00:10:19.080,GAZELLE: Children.
00:10:20.280,00:10:22.960,We begin with demi-plié.
00:10:27.360,00:10:29.560,Demi-plié.
00:10:34.440,00:10:36.680,Now a little jump.
00:10:36.680,00:10:39.000,Petit jeté.
00:10:43.600,00:10:46.280,With grace and beauty.
00:10:46.280,00:10:48.360,Petit jeté.
00:10:49.840,00:10:52.320,Grace and beauty.
00:10:59.800,00:11:02.640,Petit jeté.
00:11:02.640,00:11:05.920,Grace and beauty.
00:11:08.640,00:11:11.080,The ballet lesson is a lot of fun.
00:11:11.080,00:11:13.040,Raise you arms.
00:11:15.960,00:11:19.960,Imagine that you are beautiful swans.
00:11:28.520,00:11:32.240,And what noise do you think a swan might make?
00:11:35.840,00:11:38.880,Oh!
00:11:38.880,00:11:41.560,Grace and beauty.
00:11:41.560,00:11:43.240,Peppa loves dancing.
00:11:43.240,00:11:44.920,Everyone loves dancing.
00:11:52.440,00:11:53.840,Mommy. Mommy.
00:11:53.840,00:11:56.160,We all danced as swans.
00:11:56.160,00:11:58.680,Peppa did very well.
00:11:58.680,00:12:02.560,I had to dance beautifully and gracefully.
00:12:02.560,00:12:04.120,That's lovely.
00:12:04.120,00:12:06.720,Can I show you how I did it?
00:12:06.720,00:12:08.200,Let's get home first.
00:12:08.200,00:12:11.720,Then you can show Daddy Pig and George and me.
00:12:13.040,00:12:15.160,Bye-bye.
00:12:18.760,00:12:20.720,Peppa and Mommy Pig are home.
00:12:22.040,00:12:23.720,Daddy. George.
00:12:23.720,00:12:26.600,I'm going to show you how to do ballet.
00:12:26.600,00:12:28.000,Is it difficult?
00:12:28.000,00:12:29.960,It was easy for me.
00:12:29.960,00:12:34.080,"But you, George and Mommy will find it very hard."
00:12:35.280,00:12:37.080,"First, we need music."
00:12:44.880,00:12:47.320,Madame Gazelle used funny words.
00:12:47.320,00:12:52.120,But really it's just bending your knees and jumping.
00:12:52.120,00:12:53.480,Ah.
00:12:53.480,00:12:55.360,The petit jeté.
00:12:55.360,00:12:58.360,Daddy! You know the funny words.
00:12:58.360,00:13:02.080,Mommy Pig and I used to be quite good at ballet.
00:13:08.680,00:13:11.600,Our favorite was the pas de deux.
00:13:16.640,00:13:18.800,Hoopla!

00:09:34.600,00:09:39.880,"Picnic blanket, bread, cheese, tomatoes and lemonade."
00:09:39.880,00:09:42.200,Is there anything we've forgotten?
00:09:42.200,00:09:44.320,Mommy's strawberry cake!
00:09:44.320,00:09:47.240,"Ho, ho, I was just teasing."
00:09:47.240,00:09:50.880,Mommy's homemade strawberry cake is there too.
00:09:50.880,00:09:51.920,Is everybody ready?
00:09:51.920,00:09:53.240,Ready!
00:09:53.240,00:09:55.760,Then let's go!
00:10:02.720,00:10:05.960,This looks like just the spot for our picnic.
00:10:05.960,00:10:08.360,"PEPPA, GEORGE, MOMMY PIG: Hooray! Ha-ha-ha!"
00:10:10.400,00:10:13.160,Ah! It's great to be outdoors.
00:10:13.160,00:10:15.720,We should run around a bit and get some exercise.
00:10:15.720,00:10:18.360,"I want to eat, then have a nap."
00:10:18.360,00:10:20.920,I certainly don't want to run around.
00:10:20.920,00:10:23.480,Maybe Daddy should run around a bit.
00:10:23.480,00:10:25.440,His tummy is quite big.
00:10:25.440,00:10:27.840,My tummy is not big.
00:10:27.840,00:10:32.280,"But later, I will get some exercise, even if no one else does."
00:10:33.840,00:10:35.600,"Good idea, Mommy Pig."
00:10:35.600,00:10:37.680,I'm really hungry.
00:10:38.880,00:10:40.840,"Mm, delicious!"
00:10:49.440,00:10:52.360,"I thought you wanted to run around a bit, Daddy Pig?"
00:10:52.360,00:10:54.480,Later...
00:10:58.520,00:11:01.160,Look! There's a little duck pond.
00:11:03.120,00:11:05.960,"Mommy, can we feed the ducks?"
00:11:05.960,00:11:08.760,"Yes, you can feed them the rest of the bread."
00:11:11.680,00:11:14.680,NARRATOR Peppa and George love feeding bread to ducks.
00:11:20.560,00:11:23.120,"Mommy, I think they want some more."
00:11:23.120,00:11:25.240,That was the last of the bread.
00:11:25.240,00:11:27.120,I'm sure they've had enough.
00:11:27.120,00:11:31.120,"Sorry, Mrs. Duck, we've no more bread."
00:11:34.360,00:11:36.560,NARRATOR The ducks want more food.
00:11:38.200,00:11:41.320,So much for Daddy Pig and his exercise.
00:11:41.320,00:11:44.240,"Uh, uh? What?"
00:11:46.040,00:11:47.440,You lot again.
00:11:47.440,00:11:50.480,"Peppa told you, there's no more bread."
00:11:50.480,00:11:54.520,"PEPPA: Mommy, we do have strawberry cake."
00:11:54.520,00:11:59.120,"Well, if there's any cake left over, you can give it to the ducks."
00:11:59.120,00:12:02.680,NARRATOR: Everyone likes Mommy Pig's homemade strawberry cake.
00:12:02.680,00:12:04.440,Ooh! A wasp!
00:12:04.440,00:12:06.760,I hate wasps. Shoo!
00:12:06.760,00:12:10.480,"What a fuss, Mommy Pig."
00:12:12.560,00:12:14.520,"Just stay still, Mommy Pig."
00:12:14.520,00:12:16.280,Then it will fly away.
00:12:17.760,00:12:21.200,"There! You see, all you had to was stay still."
00:12:21.200,00:12:23.920,Eh! Get away!
00:12:23.920,00:12:26.320,Scram! Whoa!
00:12:26.320,00:12:29.440,Help! Whoa! Shoo!
00:12:29.440,00:12:31.360,Get it off me! Whoa!
00:12:31.360,00:12:34.000,I hope the wasp doesn't sting Daddy.
00:12:34.000,00:12:36.680,"Whoa! Get away, you little pest!"
00:12:36.680,00:12:40.440,"No, Daddy Pig is running too fast for the wasp to catch him."
00:12:42.320,00:12:46.080,Let's eat our cake before the wasp comes back.
00:12:51.680,00:12:55.240,"Oh, no! We forgot to leave any for the ducks."
00:12:58.080,00:12:59.400,I think I lost it.
00:12:59.400,00:13:02.840,"You said you would run around and get some exercise, Daddy Pig."
00:13:02.840,00:13:05.280,But I didn't believe you'd do it.
00:13:08.760,00:13:12.760,"Luckily, I managed to hang on to my slice of strawberry cake."
00:13:12.760,00:13:14.400,"PEPPA: Stop, Daddy!"
00:13:14.400,00:13:17.440,We promised the rest of the cake for the ducks.
00:13:17.440,00:13:19.840,Oh...
00:13:19.840,00:13:24.160,You are very lucky ducks.
00:13:24.160,00:13:26.400,Say thank you to Daddy Pig.
00:13:27.720,00:13:31.280,"You're most welcome, ho, ho!"
00:13:31.280,00:13:34.520,It's time to go home.
00:13:34.520,00:13:37.120,"Bye, bye, ducks."
00:13:37.120,00:13:40.240,See you next time! Hee-hee!
00:13:59.520,00:14:02.360,NARRATOR: Mommy Pig and Daddy Pig have been tidying the house.
00:14:03.880,00:14:07.000,Mommy Pig and I found this old box in the attic.
00:14:08.120,00:14:09.320,Ooh!
00:14:09.320,00:14:11.440,Can anyone guess what's inside?
00:14:14.280,00:14:16.480,It's full of musical instruments.
00:14:17.600,00:14:19.040,Wow!
00:14:28.080,00:14:31.520,This is the violin I used to play when I was little.
00:14:31.520,00:14:34.360,Mommy?
00:14:34.360,00:14:36.880,I haven't played it for a long time.
00:14:36.880,00:14:39.200,"Please, Mommy!"
00:14:40.360,00:14:42.840,I hope I haven't forgotten how.
00:14:48.480,00:14:49.800,Bravo!
00:14:52.600,00:14:55.000,Mommy?
00:14:55.000,00:14:56.920,Hold it like this.
00:14:56.920,00:14:58.480,"Yes, Mommy."

00:15:10.240,00:15:13.160,"Hold it like this, George."
00:15:15.840,00:15:17.680,Oh!
00:15:19.720,00:15:22.480,The violin is too hard to play.
00:15:22.480,00:15:23.880,Peppa...
00:15:23.880,00:15:25.920,...maybe you would do better with this tin drum.
00:15:27.880,00:15:29.880,NARRATOR: That sounds better.
00:15:29.880,00:15:32.320,Peppa loves playing the drum.
00:15:32.320,00:15:36.160,"Ho, ho! Lovely."
00:15:37.760,00:15:40.760,This is Daddy Pig's old accordion.
00:15:40.760,00:15:44.440,I used to play this to Mommy Pig when we first met.
00:15:46.360,00:15:50.720,"Oh, Daddy Pig."
00:15:56.120,00:15:58.480,NARRATOR: George wants to play the accordion too.
00:15:58.480,00:16:00.160,"Are you sure, George?"
00:16:00.160,00:16:02.240,The accordion is quite difficult.
00:16:02.240,00:16:08.320,"George ,the a-cro-dion is almost as difficult to play as my drum."
00:16:10.760,00:16:12.160,"Okay, George."
00:16:17.040,00:16:18.880,Oh.
00:16:18.880,00:16:22.000,NARRATOR Maybe George is a bit too little to play the accordion.

00:16:23.320,00:16:26.400,What other instruments are in the box?
00:16:26.400,00:16:27.920,Just this horn.
00:16:27.920,00:16:29.680,Can I try?
00:16:29.680,00:16:31.760,You have to blow it very hard.
00:16:35.360,00:16:37.480,NARRATOR That does not sound right.
00:16:37.480,00:16:39.360,It's impossible!
00:16:39.360,00:16:42.640,I think I used to be able to play it.
00:16:45.320,00:16:47.600,NARRATOR: That really does not sound right.
00:16:59.040,00:17:01.400,NARRATOR: That does not sound right either.
00:17:03.200,00:17:06.640,"Peppa's right, it is impossible to play."
00:17:06.640,00:17:09.960,"Never mind, Daddy Pig."
00:17:09.960,00:17:12.160,You play it beautifully.
00:17:12.160,00:17:17.360,"Ho, ho! Well, I do play it quite nicely, even if I say so myself."
00:17:17.360,00:17:19.560,And I'll play my violin.
00:17:19.560,00:17:21.560,And I will play my drum.

00:17:44.080,00:17:46.480,George is blowing the horn!
00:17:46.480,00:17:51.000,Mommy couldn't play the horn and Daddy couldn't play it.
00:17:51.000,00:17:53.320,And even I couldn't play it.
00:17:53.320,00:17:55.880,But George can play it!

00:01:46.200,00:01:48.240,I'm in my tree house.
00:01:49.680,00:01:50.760,"Oink, oink."
00:01:50.760,00:01:53.720,"George, would you like to go in the tree house too?"

00:01:56.600,00:01:58.400,Yes? Who is it?
00:01:58.400,00:02:01.240,A young pig named George would like to pay a visit.
00:02:01.240,00:02:02.720,Snort. Can he come in?
00:02:02.720,00:02:05.520,As long as he takes off his muddy boots.

00:02:30.360,00:02:32.360,Then you can come into our house.
00:02:33.760,00:02:36.680,I see. And what are the secret words?
00:02:39.400,00:02:43.520,The secret words are Daddy's Big Tummy.
00:02:43.520,00:02:45.280,I see. Ha-ha.
00:02:48.560,00:02:50.840,Say the secret words.
00:02:50.840,00:02:52.200,Daddy's Big Tummy.
00:02:52.200,00:02:55.720,That's right.
00:02:55.720,00:02:59.240,Snort. I think those are silly secret words.
00:03:00.920,00:03:06.360,"Mummy, before you come in our house, you must take off your boots."
00:03:06.360,00:03:07.640,Of course.
00:03:11.560,00:03:13.840,Snort. There's room for Daddy too.

00:03:28.640,00:03:30.000,That's right.
00:03:30.000,00:03:31.880,"You can come in now, Daddy."
00:03:31.880,00:03:34.920,Snort. Take your boots off.
00:03:51.560,00:03:55.800,"Peppa, George, Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig are all in the tree house."
00:03:57.400,00:04:02.360,"Granny, I love our tree house."
00:04:02.360,00:04:03.960,"That's nice, Peppa."
00:04:03.960,00:04:07.000,But are you sure you don't want to visit me in my house?
00:04:07.000,00:04:09.680,"No, thank you, Granny."
00:04:09.680,00:04:16.320,"In that case, Grandpa Pig and I will just have to eat my homemade cookies all by ourselves."
00:04:21.000,00:04:23.520,Granny Pig.
00:04:23.520,00:04:25.720,Here are my homemade cookies.
00:04:25.720,00:04:29.720,"But if you want to come in, you have to say the secret words."
00:04:29.720,00:04:31.040,That's easy.
00:04:31.040,00:04:33.000,Daddy's Big Tummy.
00:04:33.000,00:04:34.400,That's right.
00:04:36.000,00:04:39.800,"Well, I still think that those are very silly secret words."

00:10:41.600,00:10:44.320,This is the queen's special chair.
00:10:44.320,00:10:46.320,It's called a throne.

00:11:23.120,00:11:26.160,Snort.
00:11:23.120,00:11:29.080,"Mummy, if I was the queen, I would eat as much cake as I wanted."
00:11:29.080,00:11:31.360,Peppa imagines being a queen.
00:11:38.400,00:11:40.720,"Mmm, delicious."

00:12:00.240,00:12:04.520,"Oh, I'm most terribly sorry, Your Royal Highness."
00:12:04.520,00:12:06.120,And what do you do?
00:12:06.120,00:12:07.680,I'm your daddy.
00:12:10.480,00:12:13.440,"Yes, it's very interesting."
00:12:13.440,00:12:15.280,And what room is this?
00:12:15.280,00:12:18.320,This is the dinosaur room.
00:12:18.320,00:12:20.080,Snort! The dinosaur room?
00:12:20.080,00:12:22.920,"George, this is the dinosaur room."
00:12:26.320,00:12:28.600,Where is the dinosaur?
00:12:28.600,00:12:30.240,He's somewhere in the room.
00:12:30.240,00:12:33.680,I can't see him.
00:12:33.680,00:12:35.000,Oink.
00:12:35.000,00:12:37.720,"DADDY PIG: Actually, Peppa, he's very big."

00:13:17.320,00:13:19.160,Oink. Hee-hee-hee.
00:13:19.160,00:13:23.720,My favorite room is the king and queen's room.
00:13:23.720,00:13:27.520,And it looks as if Daddy Pig is already in his favorite room.
00:13:29.520,00:13:31.400,The room with the cakes in.
00:13:31.400,00:13:34.720,Daddy Pig's favorite room is the museum café.
00:13:36.680,00:13:39.320,Snort.
00:13:39.320,00:13:41.560,"Oh, yes. Snort."

00:13:58.360,00:14:00.760,Snort.
00:14:02.200,00:14:04.280,Peppa and George are wearing their boots.
00:14:06.400,00:14:09.120,I love muddy puddles.
00:14:09.120,00:14:10.160,Oh.
00:14:10.160,00:14:11.720,"Oh, dear."
00:14:19.920,00:14:21.560,"Never mind, Peppa."
00:14:21.560,00:14:25.320,"It's so sunny, you can play in the paddling pool instead."
00:14:25.320,00:14:27.960,"Yes, the paddling pool!"
00:14:27.960,00:14:31.080,MUMMY PIG: First you have to change into your swimming costumes.

00:14:40.600,00:14:45.880,Mummy Pig is wearing her swimming costume and Daddy Pig is wearing his swimming costume.
00:14:45.880,00:14:52.320,"Snort. Because it's so hot, you need sun cream."
00:14:52.320,00:14:53.600,Yuck!
00:14:53.600,00:14:56.320,It's all oily and yucky.
00:14:59.040,00:15:00.200,Yuck.
00:15:00.200,00:15:03.480,"Oh-ho-ho, what a fuss about nothing."
00:15:03.480,00:15:06.840,"Yes, we all need sun cream today."
00:15:12.520,00:15:14.040,Ho-ho. Snort.
00:15:14.040,00:15:15.720,"Oink, oink."
00:15:15.720,00:15:19.200,Let's get some air into this paddling pool.

00:16:12.000,00:16:14.120,"Can George and I have an ice cream, please?"
00:16:14.120,00:16:17.800,"Oh, well, I suppose it is an especially hot day."
00:16:17.800,00:16:19.280,Hooray!
00:16:19.280,00:16:21.320,"Please, can I have one as well?"

00:16:28.920,00:16:31.520,"Can I have a cone, please, Miss Rabbit?"

00:16:33.200,00:16:34.560,Thank you.
00:16:34.560,00:16:35.960,Snort.
00:16:35.960,00:16:38.560,"And one for Daddy Pig, please."
00:16:38.560,00:16:41.440,And what would young Mr. George like?
00:16:41.440,00:16:42.840,Dine-saur.
00:16:42.840,00:16:44.360,A dinosaur?
00:16:44.360,00:16:46.120,Silly George.
00:16:46.120,00:16:49.800,He always says dinosaur for everything.
00:16:49.800,00:16:54.960,"Well, it just so happens that I do have a dinosaur-shaped ice-lolly."
00:16:56.360,00:16:58.920,Dine-saur. Grrr!
00:16:58.920,00:17:02.560,"George, you should eat your ice-lolly before it melts."
00:17:03.960,00:17:08.280,"George loves his dinosaur ice-lolly so much, he doesn't want to eat it."
00:17:08.280,00:17:09.720,"Thank you, Miss Rabbit."
00:17:09.720,00:17:11.040,Enjoy the weather.
00:17:13.160,00:17:17.960,"George, I really think you should eat your ice-lolly before it melts and..."
00:17:20.280,00:17:25.360,"Oh, dear, George's dinosaur ice-lolly has melted and fallen on the ground."
00:17:26.760,00:17:28.800,You can share Daddy's ice cream.
00:17:28.800,00:17:30.560,I'm sure he won't mind.
00:17:34.000,00:17:36.920,"It is so warm, Daddy Pig has fallen asleep."
00:17:39.040,00:17:42.040,Let's tip water on Daddy to cool him down.
00:17:42.040,00:17:44.320,"Good idea, Peppa."
00:17:44.320,00:17:45.640,Whoa! Snort.
00:17:45.640,00:17:46.800,What happened?
00:17:46.800,00:17:49.000,"You were all red and hot, Daddy Pig."
00:17:57.560,00:18:00.480,Snort.
00:18:00.480,00:18:02.480,"Quick, George, let's get our boots."
00:18:02.480,00:18:03.680,"Oink, oink."
00:18:06.720,00:18:09.520,Peppa and George are wearing their boots.
00:18:10.760,00:18:16.760,"Peppa and George love the hot day, but most of all, they love jumping up and down in puddles."
00:18:16.760,00:18:18.880,"Oh, ho-ho-ho."
00:18:22.080,00:18:29.480,"PEPPA: GEORGE: Oink, oink."
