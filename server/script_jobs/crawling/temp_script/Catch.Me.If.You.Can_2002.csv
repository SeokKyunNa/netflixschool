00:03:13.860,00:03:17.114,"that we've ever come across on this show, and you're gonna see what I mean."
00:03:20.617,00:03:22.536,My name is Frank William Abagnale.
00:03:32.587,00:03:39.428,I successfully impersonated an airline pilot for Pan Am Airways and I flew over two million miles for free.
00:03:39.928,00:03:48.270,"During that time, I was also the chief resident pediatrician at a Georgia hospital and an assistant attorney general for the State of Louisiana."
00:03:48.437,00:03:54.317,"By the time I was caught, I was considered the youngest and most daring con man in US history."
00:03:54.609,00:04:01.074,"I had cashed almost four million dollars in fraudulent checks in 26 foreign countries, and all 50 states."
00:04:01.199,00:04:04.369,And I did it all before my 19th birthday.
00:04:04.786,00:04:07.706,My name is Frank William Abagnale.
00:04:12.461,00:04:16.882,"So, for the first time he's gonna have to tell the truth, and we're gonna start our questioning with Kitty."
00:04:17.007,00:04:24.639,"Thank you. Number One, why, with all your talent, and you're obviously a very bright fellow, why didn't you go in for a legitimate profession?"
00:04:25.807,00:04:27.934,It was really a question of dollars and cents.
00:04:28.018,00:04:32.522,"When I was a young man I needed the money, and I thought this list of careers was the easiest way to get it."
00:04:36.735,00:04:38.612,Who was it that finally caught you?
00:04:40.113,00:04:41.698,His name was Carl Hanratty.
00:04:45.494,00:04:48.830,Hanratty. Han... Hanratty.
00:04:49.790,00:04:52.000,-I... am... -Yes?
00:04:52.501,00:04:53.585,Carl Hanratty.
00:04:54.044,00:04:57.422,I represent the FBI from the United States of America.
00:05:00.175,00:05:03.553,I have orders to see the American prisoner Abagnale.
00:05:32.374,00:05:33.708,You sit here.
00:05:35.043,00:05:36.837,You do not open the door.
00:05:38.088,00:05:39.798,You do not pass him...
00:05:41.174,00:05:43.552,anything through the hole.
00:06:17.127,00:06:18.795,"You know, I got a little bit of a cold myself."
00:06:23.425,00:06:25.760,according to the European Court for Human Rights.
00:06:26.136,00:06:27.220,Article One.
00:06:27.470,00:06:30.557,Extradition shall be granted in respect of offenses punishable in the laws...
00:06:32.726,00:06:41.860,-Help me. -...of at least one year of a severe-- Help me.
00:06:43.403,00:06:45.530,"You don't think you're actually gonna fool me, do you?"
00:06:50.327,00:06:51.411,Article Two!
00:06:53.788,00:07:01.004,"includes several separate offenses, each of which is punishable under the laws of the requesting party Frank?"
00:07:03.590,00:07:04.633,Frank.
00:07:05.675,00:07:10.180,Goddamn it! Get me a doctor in here! I need a doctor!
00:07:12.307,00:07:14.893,"Don't sweat it, Frank. We're gonna get you right to a doctor."
00:07:19.481,00:07:22.734,"Frank, if you can hear me, don't worry. I'm gonna take you home in the morning."
00:07:29.032,00:07:31.618,-What are you doing? -Washing off the lice.
00:07:31.952,00:07:34.829,This man has to be on a plane for America. He has to see a doctor.
00:07:34.913,00:07:36.831,"Yes, the doctor comes in tomorrow."
00:07:37.540,00:07:40.543,"I have worked too long, too hard, for you to take this away from me."
00:07:40.669,00:07:42.879,"If he dies, I'm holding you responsible."
00:07:50.178,00:07:51.221,Monsieur!
00:07:56.059,00:07:57.102,"Ah, Frank."
00:08:41.896,00:08:43.064,let's go home.
00:08:50.321,00:08:57.746,"In all those years, we've only seen a handful of deserving gentlemen inducted as lifetime members."
00:09:03.043,00:09:07.338,"enshrined on the wall of honor. And tonight, we make it 58."
00:09:08.381,00:09:16.639,"So please stand as I present my very good friend, and our pens in ink."
00:09:17.140,00:09:19.350,Frank William Abagnale.
00:09:41.748,00:09:44.459,by the presence of Mayor Robert Wagner...
00:09:56.763,00:10:00.141,"Most of all, I'm honored to see my loving wife, Paula..."
00:10:20.578,00:10:24.415,Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream.
00:10:25.125,00:10:28.878,The first mouse quickly gave up and drowned.
00:10:29.671,00:10:31.047,The second mouse...
00:10:32.423,00:10:33.383,wouldn't quit.
00:10:33.591,00:10:40.431,He struggled so hard that eventually he churned that cream into butter and crawled out.
00:11:09.752,00:11:12.005,Show him the dance you were doing when we met.
00:11:14.090,00:11:20.889,"The people in that little French village were so happy to see Americans, they decided to put on a show for us."
00:11:21.306,00:11:24.893,"-So, they crammed 200 soldiers... -Yeah, we know the story, Daddy."
00:11:27.270,00:11:31.941,"and the first person to walk on stage is your mother, and she starts to dance."
00:11:32.650,00:11:38.781,"You know, it had been months since we'd even seen a woman, and here's this blonde angel."
00:11:38.990,00:11:40.283,Blonde bombshell.
00:11:42.785,00:11:45.496,And the men are literally holding their breath.
00:11:50.543,00:11:52.337,And I turned to my buddies and I said...
00:11:55.173,00:11:57.300,-And I didn't. -You didn't.
00:11:58.551,00:11:59.427,I didn't.
00:12:04.015,00:12:06.267,"-I can't believe I did that. -No, no, it's nothing, it's nothing."
00:12:06.351,00:12:08.603,"-Frankie, run and get a towel. -Yeah."
00:12:27.413,00:12:29.791,"Whenever I dance for you, I get in trouble."
00:12:44.389,00:12:46.683,"Frank. Wake up. Come on, let's go."
00:12:51.896,00:12:54.107,You don't have to go to school today. It's okay.
00:12:54.190,00:12:57.026,-Why? Is it snowing? -Do you have a black suit?
00:12:59.779,00:13:02.657,We have a very important meeting in the city. Eat that.
00:13:02.907,00:13:04.158,"Come on, come on."
00:13:15.962,00:13:17.046,"What's your name, ma'am?"
00:13:17.714,00:13:19.716,-Darcy. -Darcy. That's a pretty name.
00:13:19.799,00:13:23.553,"I'm in a bit of a fix. I need a suit for my kid. This is my son, Frank."
00:13:25.722,00:13:29.726,"There was a death in the family. My father, 85 years old, war hero."
00:13:30.310,00:13:33.229,"There's a funeral this afternoon, military funeral."
00:13:36.733,00:13:39.736,Frank needs to borrow a suit for a couple of hours.
00:13:39.819,00:13:42.405,"I'm sorry, we don't loan suits and we're not open."
00:13:46.200,00:13:48.745,"Darcy, is this yours?"
00:13:54.208,00:13:56.044,I just found it in the parking lot.
00:13:57.211,00:13:58.212,Uh-huh.
00:13:59.422,00:14:01.257,Must have slipped right off your neck.
00:14:11.017,00:14:14.354,"Now get out, walk around the back and hold the door open for me."
00:14:24.864,00:14:28.159,-All right. What's next? -Okay. Stop grinning.
00:14:28.409,00:14:31.371,"When I get inside, you go back to the front seat and wait."
00:14:31.704,00:14:35.625,"Even if a cop comes and writes you a ticket, you don't move the car, understood?"
00:14:36.084,00:14:37.710,"Dad, what's all this for?"
00:14:38.002,00:14:40.129,"You know why the Yankees always win, Frank?"
00:14:40.838,00:14:42.423,-Because they have Mickey Mantle? -No.
00:14:42.507,00:14:45.885,It's because the other teams can't stop staring at those damn pinstripes.
00:14:45.968,00:14:49.514,Watch this. The manager of Chase Manhattan Bank...
00:14:50.139,00:14:52.100,is about to open the door for your father.
00:14:55.103,00:15:01.692,"Mr. Abagnale, uh, we don't usually loan money to people who have unresolved business with the IRS."
00:15:02.151,00:15:05.363,That's a misunderstanding. I hired the wrong guy to do my books.
00:15:05.446,00:15:07.532,"A mistake, anybody could make it."
00:15:07.657,00:15:10.493,I just need you guys to help me weather the storm.
00:15:10.743,00:15:13.538,"Sir, you're being investigated by the government for tax fraud."
00:15:13.621,00:15:17.750,My store is a landmark in New Rochelle. I have customers all over New York.
00:15:18.793,00:15:21.629,"Well, you're not a customer at Chase Manhattan. We don't know you."
00:15:21.838,00:15:24.799,"I'm sure your bank in New Rochelle, they know you, could help you out."
00:15:24.882,00:15:26.634,My bank went out of business.
00:15:26.717,00:15:28.553,Banks like this one put them out of business.
00:15:28.928,00:15:31.639,"Now, I know I made a mistake, I admit that."
00:15:31.722,00:15:33.307,But these people want blood.
00:15:33.391,00:15:36.602,They want my store. They've threatened to put me in jail.
00:15:38.354,00:15:40.857,"This is America, right? I'm not a criminal."
00:15:40.940,00:15:44.652,"I'm a Medal of Honor winner, a lifetime member of the New Rochelle Rotary Club."
00:15:44.735,00:15:47.864,All I'm asking is for you to help me beat these guys.
00:15:48.448,00:15:51.576,"It's not a question of winning and losing, it's a question of risk."
00:15:53.035,00:15:56.080,You're the largest bank in the world. Where's the fu...
00:15:57.457,00:15:58.583,Where's the risk?
00:16:04.630,00:16:06.966,"Dad, how could you just let him take our car like that?"
00:16:07.049,00:16:10.678,"He didn't take anything, we took him. He overpaid by 500."
00:16:11.387,00:16:14.390,"Come on, Frank. Let's return the suit."
00:16:23.524,00:16:24.692,This place is good.
00:16:25.109,00:16:27.904,"It's small, but, you know, it's gonna be a lot less work."
00:16:56.098,00:16:57.058,Hi.
00:17:01.145,00:17:02.230,Where's your mother?
00:17:04.065,00:17:05.024,I don't know.
00:17:05.942,00:17:08.236,She said something about going to look for a job.
00:17:10.238,00:17:13.574,"What's she gonna be, a shoe salesman at a centipede farm?"
00:17:19.413,00:17:20.373,What are you doing?
00:17:22.333,00:17:24.210,You want some pancakes?
00:17:24.377,00:17:27.672,For dinner? On my son's 16th birthday?
00:17:27.755,00:17:29.298,We're not gonna eat pancakes.
00:17:32.510,00:17:35.513,"Come on... Looking at me like that, you thought I forgot."
00:17:36.347,00:17:38.808,-I didn't think you forgot. -I opened a checking account...
00:17:39.517,00:17:40.560,in your name.
00:17:41.435,00:17:44.522,"I put 25 dollars in the account, so you can buy whatever you want."
00:17:44.605,00:17:46.232,-Don't tell your mother. -I won't.
00:17:46.899,00:17:47.984,"Thanks, Dad."
00:17:49.986,00:17:51.946,"Didn't the bank turn you down for a loan, though?"
00:17:54.991,00:17:56.993,Then why are you opening a banking account with them?
00:17:57.118,00:17:59.787,"Well, because one day you'll want something from these people."
00:17:59.954,00:18:01.122,"A house, a car."
00:18:02.081,00:18:03.291,They have all the money.
00:18:10.256,00:18:16.345,"which means, from this day on, you're in their little club."
00:18:17.888,00:18:19.265,I'm in their little club.
00:18:20.516,00:18:22.059,"You got that, you got it all."
00:18:27.148,00:18:29.191,-To the moon. -To the moon.
00:18:30.776,00:18:31.736,To the moon.
00:18:41.454,00:18:45.666,See that? It's just a school. No different than Westbourne.
00:18:46.626,00:18:49.545,"Ma, you said you were gonna quit."
00:18:53.466,00:18:56.344,"Frankie, you don't have to wear the uniform here."
00:18:57.637,00:18:59.513,Why don't you take off your jacket?
00:19:00.514,00:19:01.599,I'm used to it.
00:19:07.605,00:19:09.065,"-Excuse me. -Oh, yes?"
00:19:09.231,00:19:10.900,"Do you know where Room 17, French is?"
00:19:26.916,00:19:28.376,You selling encyclopedias?
00:19:28.793,00:19:30.961,"Yeah, he looks like a substitute teacher."
00:19:49.188,00:19:50.940,My name is Mr. Abagnale!
00:19:53.609,00:19:57.947,"not Abagnahlee, not Abagnaylee, but Abagnale."
00:20:03.994,00:20:08.916,"Excuse me, people. If I need to ask again, I'm gonna write up the entire class. Take your seats!"
00:20:13.713,00:20:15.005,Chapter seven.
00:20:15.381,00:20:19.385,"Would you please open your textbooks to chapter eight, and we'll get started."
00:20:20.845,00:20:22.763,-Excuse me. What's your name? -Brad.
00:20:22.847,00:20:28.394,"Brad, why don't you get up here in front of the class here, and read conversation number five."
00:20:43.075,00:20:47.371,They sent for me. They said they needed a sub for Roberta.
00:20:47.830,00:20:50.040,I came all the way from Dixon.
00:20:51.083,00:20:53.043,"Oh, I always sub for Roberta."
00:20:53.627,00:20:55.045,"Excuse me, why aren't you reading?"
00:20:57.339,00:21:00.718,I'll never come back to Bellarmine-Jefferson again!
00:21:02.887,00:21:08.684,"What, do they think it's easy for a woman my age and all the money that it costs to travel? I tell you, they don't give a damn."
00:21:08.934,00:21:13.481,"Mr. and Mrs. Abagnale, this is not a question of your son's attendance."
00:21:13.564,00:21:20.112,"I regret to inform you that for the past week, Frank has been teaching Mrs. Glasser's French class."
00:21:22.072,00:21:22.948,He what?
00:21:23.866,00:21:27.244,Your son has been pretending to be a substitute teacher.
00:21:27.953,00:21:31.290,"Lecturing the students, giving out homework."
00:21:34.084,00:21:36.545,there was some confusion with the real sub.
00:21:38.172,00:21:46.472,Your son held a teacher-parent conference yesterday and was planning a class field trip to a French bread factory in Trenton.
00:21:47.681,00:21:49.433,Do you see the problem we have?
00:21:51.852,00:21:54.730,"Mrs. Davenport, I have a note to miss fifth and sixth period today."
00:21:56.190,00:21:58.025,One moment. I'll be right with you.
00:21:59.401,00:22:00.277,Hey.
00:22:03.989,00:22:07.076,"That note. It's a fake, right? You should fold it."
00:22:07.159,00:22:09.662,It's a note from my mom. I have a doctor's appointment.
00:22:09.745,00:22:12.373,"Yeah, but there's no crease in the paper."
00:22:12.581,00:22:17.628,"When your mom hands you a note to miss school, the first thing you do is you fold it and you put it in your pocket."
00:22:18.796,00:22:20.297,"If it's real, where's the crease?"
00:22:31.225,00:22:32.184,Frankie.
00:22:52.663,00:22:55.082,You remember that girl Joanna I was telling you about?
00:22:56.417,00:22:57.918,I asked her out today.
00:22:59.461,00:23:01.380,Think we're gonna go to the junior prom.
00:23:05.968,00:23:07.428,"That's all there is, two bedrooms."
00:23:12.683,00:23:15.019,Jack Barnes. From the club.
00:23:15.436,00:23:16.395,Hello.
00:23:18.564,00:23:20.608,I was giving him a tour of the apartment.
00:23:21.233,00:23:24.111,"It's very, er, er, spacious, Paula."
00:23:29.950,00:23:31.243,Dad's at the store.
00:23:32.661,00:23:33.746,"So, Frank..."
00:23:34.788,00:23:37.541,you're getting to look more like your old man every day.
00:23:40.461,00:23:42.171,"Thanks for the sandwich, Paula."
00:23:43.797,00:23:45.591,"-I'll see you later, huh? -Wait."
00:23:51.388,00:23:54.099,-Is this yours? -Oh.
00:23:55.935,00:23:58.729,"Thanks, Frank. That's the President's pin."
00:24:00.147,00:24:02.107,I'd be in deep trouble if I lost that.
00:24:08.697,00:24:10.032,"I'll see you all later, huh?"
00:24:20.417,00:24:23.671,"Are you hungry, Frankie? I'll make you a sandwich."
00:24:32.805,00:24:34.890,Jack wanted to talk business with your father.
00:24:37.059,00:24:39.853,He thinks we should get a lawyer and sue the government.
00:24:41.647,00:24:43.691,"That is not legal, what they're doing to us."
00:24:47.486,00:24:48.988,Why aren't you saying anything?
00:24:56.286,00:24:58.956,"You're not going to tell him, are you?"
00:25:00.666,00:25:01.542,No.
00:25:02.751,00:25:05.004,That's right. There's nothing to tell.
00:25:06.797,00:25:15.597,"I'm going out for a few hours to visit some old friends from the tennis club, and when I get home, we'll all have dinner together. Right?"
00:25:17.016,00:25:21.603,"But you won't say anything because it's just silly, isn't it?"
00:25:22.479,00:25:24.023,How could we sue anybody?
00:25:28.694,00:25:31.989,"Oh! Do you need some money, Frankie?"
00:25:33.198,00:25:36.160,A few dollars to buy some record albums?
00:25:36.577,00:25:38.579,Here. Take five dollars.
00:25:40.372,00:25:41.331,Or ten.
00:25:47.337,00:25:48.964,You promised you were gonna quit.
00:26:09.151,00:26:10.360,"Ma, I'm home."
00:26:25.959,00:26:28.545,"-Hey, hey! -You. You stay away from me. You hear me?"
00:26:28.629,00:26:32.633,"You stay away from her. I don't know who you are, -but if you come back here again-- -Frank! Frank, Frank."
00:26:32.758,00:26:34.635,"Calm down, will you? I'm Dick Kesner."
00:26:35.344,00:26:39.348,"I want you to leave your things here, follow me into the next room, okay?"
00:26:39.556,00:26:40.682,They're all waiting for you.
00:26:46.688,00:26:48.065,I'll always be here.
00:26:48.565,00:26:52.319,But there are laws. Everything in this country has to be legal.
00:26:52.569,00:26:55.155,So what we need to do is make some decisions.
00:26:55.447,00:26:57.074,That's what Mr. Kesner is here for.
00:26:57.157,00:26:59.701,"Many times, these decisions are left up to the courts."
00:26:59.785,00:27:02.621,"But that can be very expensive, Frank, people fighting over their children."
00:27:02.704,00:27:03.997,Nobody's fighting.
00:27:04.289,00:27:06.667,"Look at me, Frank. Nobody is fighting."
00:27:12.131,00:27:13.590,"Dad, what's going on?"
00:27:15.843,00:27:19.429,"Do you remember your grandma, Eve? She arrived this morning."
00:27:30.941,00:27:34.153,"Do you understand what we're saying to you, Frank?"
00:27:35.529,00:27:38.866,Your father and I are getting a divorce.
00:27:42.119,00:27:43.662,Nothing's gonna change.
00:27:43.829,00:27:46.874,"-We're still gonna see each other. -Stop it, please, Frank. Don't interrupt."
00:27:46.999,00:27:48.750,"Frank, you don't have to read all of this."
00:27:48.834,00:27:51.378,"Most of it's for your parents, boring adult business."
00:27:51.461,00:27:57.050,"But this paragraph right here, this is important because it states who you're gonna live with..."
00:27:58.468,00:28:01.513,after the divorce. Whose custody you will be in.
00:28:02.014,00:28:04.558,And there's a blank space right here.
00:28:05.934,00:28:10.230,"I want you to go into the kitchen, sit at the table, and put a name down."
00:28:10.814,00:28:15.736,"You can take as long as you want, but when you come back into this room, I want to see a name on that line."
00:28:16.528,00:28:20.324,"Frank, just write down a name and this will all be over."
00:28:20.532,00:28:21.783,It's gonna be okay.
00:28:23.952,00:28:25.037,Your mother or your father.
00:28:25.120,00:28:27.039,Just put the name there. It's as simple as that.
00:28:32.002,00:28:33.337,There's no wrong answer.
00:28:49.019,00:28:50.771,"One ticket to Grand Central, please."
00:28:50.896,00:28:52.648,"That'll be three dollars and 50 cents, sir."
00:28:54.149,00:28:55.859,Is it okay if I write you a check?
00:29:01.990,00:29:04.034,"Carl, when do I get to call my father?"
00:29:07.788,00:29:09.623,We leave for the airport in seven hours.
00:29:10.958,00:29:12.417,"Until then, just sit there."
00:29:13.377,00:29:14.294,Be quiet.
00:29:15.796,00:29:19.258,"Carl, on the other side of the hotel they got suites that face the park."
00:29:21.093,00:29:23.053,It's the best room the FBI can afford.
00:29:26.598,00:29:28.350,"It's okay, I've stayed in worse."
00:29:28.767,00:29:31.478,"Mr. Mudrick, Mr Mudrick, please. You have to listen."
00:29:31.561,00:29:34.982,I don't want to hear your story. This is two checks that bounced.
00:29:35.065,00:29:36.566,You know how much trouble I'm in?
00:29:36.650,00:29:39.361,"No, but listen, I'm telling you, the bank, they made the mistake."
00:29:39.528,00:29:43.240,-I'll write you another check right now! -Do I look like I was born yesterday?
00:29:43.323,00:29:46.034,"Look, it's midnight, Mr. Mudrick. Where am I gonna go?"
00:29:46.118,00:29:48.745,You're a goddamn kid. Go home.
00:30:40.422,00:30:44.217,Now he wants me in Long Island to take a few clients out for a night on the town.
00:30:44.760,00:30:48.472,"I'm sorry, but we're not allowed to cash checks from other banks."
00:30:48.847,00:30:51.683,-How would we know if they were any good? -What did you say your name was?
00:30:51.808,00:30:53.310,-Ashley. -Ashley.
00:30:53.602,00:30:55.854,You know what I found on the sidewalk out there?
00:31:01.860,00:31:03.612,Must have slipped right off your neck.
00:31:08.700,00:31:10.911,"Is there something I can help you with, son?"
00:31:11.787,00:31:16.083,"You see, it's my grandmother's birthday next week and I want to get her something extra special."
00:31:17.042,00:31:19.795,"Please, it's my midterm next week and my books were stolen."
00:31:22.381,00:31:24.758,"Please, it's just five dollars. No one would have to know."
00:31:25.342,00:31:30.472,"I'm sorry, but we are not allowed to take checks from people we don't know."
00:32:12.639,00:32:14.349,"Pleasure to have you back, Captain Carlson."
00:32:14.433,00:32:17.936,"What do you think, Angelo? The tomatoes are ripe this afternoon."
00:32:27.070,00:32:28.738,-Can I have your autograph? -You betcha.
00:32:29.114,00:32:32.993,"-Can I have your autograph, too? -You gonna be a pilot? All right, there."
00:32:33.285,00:32:34.828,Here you go. Work hard in school.
00:32:36.496,00:32:38.623,I have decided to become an airline pilot.
00:32:38.999,00:32:43.420,I have applied to all the big airlines and I have several promising interviews lined up.
00:32:44.254,00:32:46.673,How's Mom? Have you called her lately?
00:32:47.299,00:32:49.926,"Love, your son, Frank."
00:32:53.555,00:32:54.514,Hello.
00:32:55.515,00:32:59.644,"I'm Frank Black from Murrow High School, and I have an appointment with Mr. Morgan."
00:33:00.562,00:33:03.148,You're the young man who's writing the article for the school paper.
00:33:03.398,00:33:04.399,"Yes, ma'am. That's me."
00:33:04.524,00:33:06.610,I want to know everything there is to know about being a pilot.
00:33:07.736,00:33:11.364,What airports does Pan Am fly to? What does a pilot make in a year?
00:33:11.448,00:33:12.908,Who tells them where they're gonna fly to?
00:33:12.991,00:33:14.784,"Whoa, whoa, slow down. Just take them one at a time."
00:33:14.868,00:33:19.498,"All right. What does it mean when one pilot says to another pilot, What kind of equipment are you on?"
00:33:19.623,00:33:21.291,They just want to know what aircraft you're flying.
00:33:21.374,00:33:23.418,"Is it the DC-8, 707, Constellation."
00:33:23.502,00:33:26.463,And what about those ID badges that I've seen pilots wear?
00:33:26.588,00:33:28.840,"Well, every pilot has to have two things with him at all times."
00:33:28.924,00:33:32.427,"One is his airline personnel badge, looks just like this one here from Pan Am."
00:33:32.511,00:33:34.804,The other one is their FAA license.
00:33:35.305,00:33:37.057,And that looks just like this.
00:33:38.433,00:33:39.476,Whoa.
00:33:40.602,00:33:43.188,You think I could make a copy of this to put into my article?
00:33:43.313,00:33:46.191,"No, Frank, you can have that one, it's three years expired."
00:33:46.274,00:33:48.401,"Oh, thanks! What about your ID badge?"
00:33:51.696,00:33:53.281,Those are special-ordered from Polaroid.
00:33:53.365,00:33:57.452,The only way to get one of those is to become a real live pilot for Pan American Airways.
00:34:10.423,00:34:13.051,"Um, I'm a copilot based out of San Francisco."
00:34:13.134,00:34:18.348,"I flew a flight into New York last night, but the problem is I'm headed out to Paris in three hours."
00:34:20.600,00:34:23.812,"I sent my uniform to be cleaned through the hotel, and I..."
00:34:24.396,00:34:25.772,I guess they must have lost it.
00:34:28.608,00:34:31.361,Go down to the Well-Built Uniform Company at 9th and Broadway.
00:34:31.444,00:34:34.281,They're our uniform supplier. I'll tell Mr. Rosen you're coming.
00:34:38.952,00:34:40.161,Why so nervous?
00:34:40.912,00:34:44.749,How would you feel if you lost your uniform first week on the job?
00:34:48.670,00:34:50.880,It's gonna be 164 dollars.
00:34:51.631,00:34:55.719,"-Great. I'll write you a check. -Sorry, no checks, no cash."
00:34:55.927,00:34:58.221,You'll have to fill in your employee ID number.
00:34:58.346,00:35:01.683,"Then I'll bill Pan Am, they'll take it out of your next paycheck."
00:35:03.977,00:35:04.936,Even better.
00:35:08.732,00:35:11.401,you always told me that an honest man has nothing to fear.
00:35:11.735,00:35:13.820,So I'm trying my best not to be afraid.
00:35:14.821,00:35:17.407,"I'm sorry I ran away, but you don't have to worry."
00:35:17.866,00:35:22.537,"I'm gonna get it all back now, Daddy. I promise. I'm gonna get it all back."
00:35:29.085,00:35:32.756,"-Are you a real live pilot? -I sure am, little lady. What's your name?"
00:35:32.964,00:35:33.882,Celine.
00:35:35.925,00:35:37.636,"It's a pleasure to meet you, too."
00:35:41.973,00:35:47.729,"That's 50, 70, 80, 90, 100 dollars."
00:35:48.396,00:35:51.691,-You have yourself a great time in Paris. -I always do.
00:35:52.901,00:35:53.943,Excuse me.
00:35:55.528,00:35:57.614,I'm John Modiger. I manage this branch.
00:35:57.739,00:35:59.908,I want to thank you for coming and using our institution.
00:35:59.991,00:36:02.160,"It's a pleasure to meet you, John. I'll be back again."
00:36:02.243,00:36:04.621,-Good. -Have you stayed with us before?
00:36:05.872,00:36:08.750,"No, I've been primarily based on the West Coast."
00:36:10.126,00:36:12.087,Is it all right if I write you a check for the room?
00:36:12.170,00:36:13.588,"-No problem, sir. -Great."
00:36:22.514,00:36:25.934,"Uh, I was also wondering if I could write you a personal check?"
00:36:26.643,00:36:29.437,"For airline personnel, we cash personal checks up to 100 dollars."
00:36:29.979,00:36:31.564,Payroll checks we cash up to 300.
00:36:33.066,00:36:35.485,Did you say 300 for a payroll check?
00:36:42.659,00:36:48.331,"I've decided to become a pilot for Pan American Airways, the most trusted name in the skies."
00:36:48.415,00:36:54.629,"They have accepted me into their training program and told me that if I work hard, I should earn my wings real soon."
00:36:55.171,00:36:58.299,Please get in touch with Joanna Carlton from the tenth grade.
00:36:58.466,00:37:01.094,Tell her I'm sorry that I could not take her to the junior prom.
00:37:42.343,00:37:44.179,"-Hello, how are you? -Fine, thank you."
00:37:44.429,00:37:46.389,I have a payroll check here I'd like to cash.
00:37:46.556,00:37:47.724,Certainly.
00:37:49.976,00:37:51.144,Excuse me.
00:37:52.312,00:37:56.900,"I'm sure you hear this all the time, but, you have the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen."
00:38:02.030,00:38:03.114,How would you like it?
00:38:19.088,00:38:23.092,"I'm sorry, sir. We won't have any cash until the banks open in an hour."
00:38:23.384,00:38:27.013,But I'm sure they can cash your check at the airport.
00:38:27.847,00:38:30.558,The airport? Who cashes checks at the airport?
00:38:31.476,00:38:34.729,"The airlines, sir. They've always taken care of their own."
00:38:40.109,00:38:42.779,All passengers for flight 27 to Miami.
00:38:43.905,00:38:45.990,-Hello. -Hi. Are you deadheading?
00:38:47.075,00:38:49.536,-What? -Are you my deadhead to Miami?
00:38:54.999,00:38:57.210,"Yeah, I'm the deadhead. Here you go."
00:38:58.378,00:39:00.755,"You're a little late, but the jump seat is open."
00:39:04.050,00:39:06.594,it's been a while since I've done this. Which one is the jump seat again?
00:39:11.307,00:39:12.559,Are you my deadhead?
00:39:15.520,00:39:18.481,"Frank, Captain Oliver. John Larkin, the copilot."
00:39:18.648,00:39:20.233,"-Hello. -Fred Tulley, flight engineer."
00:39:20.733,00:39:23.152,"Frank Taylor, Pan Am. Thanks for giving me a lift, boys."
00:39:23.611,00:39:25.822,"Go ahead and take a seat, Frank. We're about to push."
00:39:26.489,00:39:29.742,"-What kind of equipment you on, DC-8? -707."
00:39:30.451,00:39:31.786,You turning around on the redeye?
00:39:32.620,00:39:37.709,I'm jumping puddles for the next few months trying to earn my keep running leap frogs for the weak and weary.
00:39:38.376,00:39:40.920,No shame in that. We all did it.
00:39:48.094,00:39:49.554,-Have a seat. -Thank you.
00:39:53.558,00:39:54.475,Milk?
00:39:57.562,00:39:58.980,V-one. Rotate.
00:40:09.574,00:40:14.078,"I am now a copilot, earning 1,400 dollars a month, plus benefits."
00:40:14.412,00:40:18.082,"And the best part is, they tell me my family can fly for free."
00:40:18.416,00:40:24.005,So tell Mom to pack her bags and buy a new swimsuit because I'm taking us all to Hawaii for Christmas.
00:40:25.006,00:40:28.384,"I love you, Dad. Aloha, Frank."
00:40:29.344,00:40:30.803,"-Hello, deadhead. -Hello."
00:40:30.887,00:40:32.138,Enjoying your free ride?
00:40:46.486,00:40:48.112,Must have slipped right off your neck.
00:40:53.159,00:40:54.035,No.
00:41:05.046,00:41:06.172,Why are you stopping?
00:41:08.299,00:41:10.051,"I want to tell you something, Marci."
00:41:12.553,00:41:18.601,This is by far the best date I have ever been on.
00:41:50.675,00:41:53.344,Welcome to Miami Mutual Bank. How may I help you?
00:41:53.678,00:41:56.389,My name is Frank Taylor. I'm a copilot for Pan Am.
00:41:56.472,00:42:02.687,I'd like to cash this check here and then I'd like to take you out for a steak dinner.
00:42:13.531,00:42:19.495,Then we feed the checks into the MICR machine which uses special ink to encode the account numbers on the bottom of the checks.
00:42:21.039,00:42:24.125,"-And where are these numbers? -They're, um..."
00:42:25.168,00:42:26.836,-right here. See? -Right there?
00:42:32.925,00:42:34.594,So where do the checks get routed to?
00:42:35.928,00:42:40.099,"You know, I don't exactly know. Nobody ever asked me that before."
00:42:41.601,00:42:44.812,Our next item up for bid is also from the Jersey Central Bank foreclosure.
00:42:45.229,00:42:48.483,"This is a MICR encoder, a machine used to encode bank checks."
00:42:48.941,00:42:50.026,Do I have an opening bid?
00:42:51.903,00:42:53.613,who started working on the east coast.
00:42:53.780,00:42:58.034,In the last few weeks this unsub has developed a new form of check fraud which I'm calling The Float.
00:42:58.409,00:43:04.832,"What he's doing is, he's opening checking accounts at various banks then changing the MICR ink routing numbers at the bottom of those checks."
00:43:09.545,00:43:11.756,The remote thing is broken. You'll have to do it by hand.
00:43:12.924,00:43:14.258,You gotta... Try the...
00:43:17.762,00:43:20.014,This carousel doesn't work. It's a bad carousel.
00:43:22.436,00:43:25.478,This is a map of the 12 banks of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
00:43:28.356,00:43:32.485,MICR scanners at every bank read these numbers at the bottom of the check. Slide.
00:43:32.860,00:43:36.239,And then ship that check off to its corresponding branch.
00:43:36.364,00:43:42.245,"Carl, for those of us who are unfamiliar with bank fraud, you mind telling us what the hell you're talking about?"
00:43:43.204,00:43:47.291,The east coast branches are numbered 01 to 06.
00:43:47.375,00:43:50.086,"The central branch is 07, 08, so on and so forth."
00:43:50.211,00:43:52.713,You mean those numbers on the bottom of a check actually mean something?
00:43:52.797,00:43:55.967,All of this was in the report I filed two days ago. If you change...
00:43:56.801,00:44:08.396,"a 02 to a 12, that means that check, which was cashed in New York, does not go to the New York Federal Branch, but is re-routed all the way to the San Francisco Federal Branch."
00:44:08.729,00:44:11.190,The bank doesn't even know the check has bounced for two weeks.
00:44:11.357,00:44:16.821,"Which means our unsub can stay in one place, paper the same city over and over again while his checks circle the country."
00:44:17.363,00:44:19.824,"You know, you want to talk to my wife."
00:44:20.575,00:44:22.827,She's the one balances the checkbook at our house.
00:44:28.374,00:44:29.458,Next slide.
00:44:36.632,00:44:38.050,Daddy!
00:44:40.303,00:44:43.055,"My son, the birdman. That's some uniform, Frank."
00:44:43.139,00:44:44.307,What do you think?
00:44:45.558,00:44:47.894,-Nice. -Sit down.
00:44:54.192,00:44:55.109,Of course.
00:44:55.651,00:44:56.819,This fork is ice-cold.
00:44:56.986,00:44:59.989,"No, no, Dad, that's a chilled salad fork."
00:45:09.498,00:45:10.458,Here.
00:45:12.084,00:45:14.253,-I got you something. -What's that?
00:45:14.879,00:45:15.838,Open it.
00:45:24.388,00:45:28.893,Those are the keys to a 1965 Cadillac de Ville convertible.
00:45:29.101,00:45:32.355,"Brand-new, Dad. Red with white interior."
00:45:32.647,00:45:35.900,"Split seats, air conditioning, the works."
00:45:40.529,00:45:47.912,"Dad, she's parked downstairs. When we're done eating lunch, why don't you, you know, drive on over to Mom's house, pick her up, take a little joy ride."
00:45:48.204,00:45:53.501,Do you know what would happen if the IRS found out I was driving around in a new coupe?
00:45:55.169,00:45:58.965,"I took the train here, Frank. I'm taking the train home."
00:46:01.133,00:46:02.093,All right.
00:46:09.767,00:46:11.185,I have plenty of money.
00:46:11.686,00:46:16.816,"-You know, if you ever need anything. -You worried? About me?"
00:46:18.025,00:46:21.946,"-No, I'm not worried. -You think I can't buy my own car?"
00:46:22.154,00:46:25.491,"Two mice fell in a bucket of cream, Frank."
00:46:26.492,00:46:27.576,Which one am I?
00:46:28.995,00:46:30.371,You're that second mouse.
00:46:32.832,00:46:34.375,I went by the store today.
00:46:36.460,00:46:39.880,"I had to close the store for a while. It's all about timing, Frank."
00:46:39.964,00:46:42.925,Goddamn government knows that. They hit you when you're down.
00:46:43.134,00:46:45.511,"I wasn't gonna let them take it from me, so I just..."
00:46:46.012,00:46:48.389,"shut the doors myself, called their bluff."
00:46:53.602,00:46:55.771,"Sooner or later, they'll forget about me."
00:46:56.397,00:46:57.398,I understand.
00:46:59.650,00:47:00.901,Have you told Ma?
00:47:03.904,00:47:06.991,She's so stubborn. Your mother...
00:47:10.536,00:47:13.205,"Don't worry, I'm not gonna let her go without a fight."
00:47:13.706,00:47:15.041,I'm fighting for us.
00:47:18.294,00:47:19.211,Dad?
00:47:21.964,00:47:24.258,Since the day we met.
00:47:24.925,00:47:30.598,"Daddy, out of all those men, you were the one that took her home, remember that?"
00:47:30.681,00:47:35.019,"Two hundred men, sitting in that tiny social hall, watching her dance."
00:47:38.314,00:47:41.275,"-What was the name of that town? -Montrichard, Dad."
00:47:42.568,00:47:51.535,I didn't speak a word of French She is your wife.
00:47:54.246,00:47:58.667,My son bought me a Cadillac today. I think that calls for a toast.
00:48:08.594,00:48:10.763,To the best damn pilot in the sky.
00:48:12.181,00:48:14.308,It's not what you think. I'm just a copilot.
00:48:16.894,00:48:18.729,You see these people staring at you?
00:48:23.025,00:48:25.611,These are the most powerful people in New York City.
00:48:26.445,00:48:30.491,"And they keep peeking over their shoulders, wondering where you're going tonight."
00:48:31.283,00:48:32.493,"Where you going, Frank?"
00:48:33.285,00:48:34.912,"Dad, nobody's staring at me."
00:48:35.996,00:48:37.373,Some place exotic?
00:48:40.042,00:48:41.419,Just tell me where you're going.
00:48:44.713,00:48:47.758,-Los An... Hollywood. -Hollywood?
00:48:51.429,00:48:52.388,Come here.
00:48:54.890,00:48:57.893,The rest of us really are suckers.
00:49:04.859,00:49:07.194,"So, I got on this red dress and these high heels, right?"
00:49:07.278,00:49:09.113,"I got a bra, like, out here, okay?"
00:49:09.196,00:49:11.532,And I'm chasing these two Puerto Rican guys through the park.
00:49:11.615,00:49:14.118,They got a suitcase filled with bank robbery loot.
00:49:14.326,00:49:16.704,"Okay, I'm screaming out, FBI, freeze!"
00:49:16.787,00:49:21.876,"And I'm reaching for my gun but I can't find it in the bra, it's so damn big, I thought I was gonna shoot my tits off."
00:49:29.133,00:49:30.634,"Let me ask you a question, Mr. Amdursky."
00:49:30.759,00:49:34.263,"If you were having so much fun undercover, why did you transfer to bank fraud?"
00:49:34.555,00:49:37.683,I didn't transfer. I was censured and reassigned.
00:49:38.517,00:49:41.145,It's like being punished. I was punished. I screwed up in the field.
00:49:42.021,00:49:44.773,"What about you, Mr. Fox, were you punished for screwing up in the field?"
00:49:44.857,00:49:46.901,"Oh, no, no, I've never worked in the field before."
00:49:47.443,00:49:51.197,I audited background investigations of Department of Justice clerical applicants.
00:49:51.739,00:49:55.117,"Well, that's just great. I ask for a team and they drag the bottom of the Pacific."
00:49:56.702,00:49:58.871,"Mind if I ask you a question, Agent Hanratty?"
00:49:59.288,00:50:02.291,"-How come you're so serious all the time? -Does it bother you, Mr. Amdursky?"
00:50:03.542,00:50:05.628,"Yeah. Yeah, it does bother me."
00:50:05.836,00:50:07.296,"Does it bother you, Mr. Fox?"
00:50:07.838,00:50:08.839,"A little, I guess."
00:50:10.591,00:50:12.426,"Well, would you like to hear me tell a joke?"
00:50:14.887,00:50:17.431,"Yeah. Yeah, we'd love to hear a joke from you."
00:50:19.350,00:50:21.769,"-Knock, knock. -Who's there?"
00:50:24.980,00:50:26.315,Go fuck yourselves.
00:50:43.040,00:50:44.792,I was gonna deposit this one today.
00:50:46.877,00:50:47.962,I don't want any trouble.
00:50:49.630,00:50:50.714,No trouble.
00:50:51.757,00:50:54.593,No trouble at all. We'll just take this check and be on our way.
00:50:54.677,00:50:55.928,-Thank you. -Good.
00:50:56.554,00:50:58.556,Because I don't want my customers harassed.
00:51:01.475,00:51:02.935,What are you saying? He's still here?
00:51:05.271,00:51:06.188,Room 201.
00:51:08.440,00:51:09.316,Thank you.
00:51:10.526,00:51:14.029,"-Corner here. -Thanks, son. Hot."
00:51:19.785,00:51:22.121,"Hey, hey. Mr. Murphy, how are you?"
00:51:22.204,00:51:23.747,"-Is that Frank? -Yeah, it's Frank."
00:51:23.831,00:51:25.791,"-Hey, Frank, how are you? -How's the knee?"
00:51:31.297,00:51:34.550,"Eyeball the back? Come on, Carl, his guy's a pen-and-ink man. A goddamn paperhanger."
00:51:34.633,00:51:36.719,"-He doesn't even carry a gun. -Why can't we go with you, Carl?"
00:51:36.802,00:51:39.763,"Just keep your eyes open, do your job, and I'll buy you both a Good Humor bar."
00:51:55.404,00:51:58.157,"201. 201, 201."
00:51:58.824,00:52:01.827,"201. 201, 201."
00:52:09.710,00:52:11.003,FBI!
00:52:20.262,00:52:21.305,FBI.
00:52:22.598,00:52:23.891,Come out of the bathroom.
00:52:25.726,00:52:27.269,Step out of the bathroom!
00:52:31.732,00:52:32.733,Hands on your head.
00:52:32.816,00:52:34.943,-That's the new IBM Selectric. -Put your hands on your head.
00:52:35.027,00:52:36.695,It can change the print type in five seconds.
00:52:36.779,00:52:37.946,-Shut up! -Just pop out the ball.
00:52:38.030,00:52:40.032,Put your hands on your head! Put your hands...
00:52:40.157,00:52:41.909,"You know, he's got over 200 checks here..."
00:52:42.034,00:52:44.036,"-Hands on your head! -...a gallon of India ink, drafting."
00:52:44.244,00:52:46.288,Even has little payroll envelopes addressed to himself.
00:52:46.372,00:52:48.749,-Put it down! Drop it! -Relax!
00:52:49.416,00:52:50.959,"You're late, all right?"
00:52:51.210,00:52:53.879,"My name's Allen, Barry Allen, United States Secret Service."
00:52:53.962,00:52:55.714,Your boy just tried to jump out the window.
00:52:55.881,00:52:58.300,-My partner has him in custody. -I don't know what you're talking about.
00:52:59.176,00:53:02.638,"You think the FBI are the only ones on this guy? I mean, come on."
00:53:05.182,00:53:08.310,We've been following a paper trail on this guy for months now.
00:53:09.061,00:53:11.397,"Hey, you mind taking that gun out of my face?"
00:53:11.480,00:53:13.190,"Please, really. It makes me nervous."
00:53:13.565,00:53:14.942,Let me see some credentials.
00:53:15.818,00:53:16.860,"Yeah, sure."
00:53:21.156,00:53:23.701,"You want my gun, too? Come over here, take my gun."
00:53:24.910,00:53:28.997,"Hey, hey, look. Just do me a favor, take a look outside. Look. Look out the window."
00:53:29.164,00:53:31.542,My partner's walking him to the car as we speak. Look.
00:53:38.590,00:53:41.093,He jumped right through the window onto the hood of my car.
00:53:42.720,00:53:43.887,"-Hey, Murph? -Yeah?"
00:53:43.971,00:53:45.097,Call the LAPD again.
00:53:45.264,00:53:47.391,I don't want people walking through my crime scene.
00:53:49.893,00:53:52.062,I didn't expect the Secret Service on this.
00:53:52.813,00:53:55.399,Don't worry about it. What's your name?
00:53:56.191,00:53:58.402,"Hanratty, Carl Hanratty."
00:54:04.116,00:54:07.286,-Mind if I see some identification? -Sure.
00:54:07.411,00:54:09.788,You never can be too careful these days.
00:54:11.540,00:54:12.916,"Well, tough luck, Carl."
00:54:13.584,00:54:16.211,"Five minutes earlier, you would've landed yourself a pretty good collar."
00:54:16.336,00:54:18.881,Is that right? Ten seconds later and you'd have been shot.
00:54:20.424,00:54:23.594,Mind if I come downstairs with you? I got to take a look at this guy.
00:54:23.677,00:54:27.848,Sure thing. Just do me a favor and sit tight for a second while I get this evidence downstairs.
00:54:27.931,00:54:30.934,"You know, I don't want some maid walking through here and making the bed."
00:54:31.018,00:54:33.353,-LAPD should be here any sec. -Wait.
00:54:38.233,00:54:39.234,Your wallet.
00:54:40.360,00:54:43.071,You hang onto it for a minute. I trust you.
00:55:00.756,00:55:03.884,Yeah. Secret Service.
00:55:46.385,00:55:47.302,Hey!
00:55:48.595,00:55:50.347,"Oh, goddamn it!"
00:55:52.015,00:55:54.643,It was stupid. I made a stupid mistake.
00:55:55.477,00:55:56.478,Forget about it.
00:55:57.229,00:55:59.606,There are hundreds of unknown subjects out there.
00:55:59.731,00:56:01.024,"I can get this guy, Sean."
00:56:01.692,00:56:03.819,The worst thing a paperhanger can do is show his face.
00:56:05.320,00:56:09.157,"Six feet tall, brown hair, 27 to 30 years of age, 160 pounds."
00:56:09.283,00:56:10.617,This could be almost anybody.
00:56:10.784,00:56:12.744,"I heard his voice, Sean. I saw his face."
00:56:12.995,00:56:14.788,There's nothing for him to hide behind anymore.
00:56:16.206,00:56:19.209,Just be careful. You got 12 years in.
00:56:19.960,00:56:21.670,Nobody bothers you down on the first floor.
00:56:21.753,00:56:23.505,You practically wrote the book on bank fraud.
00:56:23.630,00:56:25.966,That's the kind of thing can make you a section chief someday.
00:56:30.178,00:56:31.346,What type of position?
00:56:33.181,00:56:34.892,The position of being humiliated.
00:56:44.026,00:56:46.320,"Sean, would you like to hear me tell a joke?"
00:56:48.030,00:56:49.156,"Yeah, sure."
00:56:50.616,00:56:51.992,"Knock, knock."
00:56:59.625,00:57:02.294,"Um, Pan Am sends them a check every single month?"
00:57:02.878,00:57:05.422,"Yeah, pension program sends a check and benefits."
00:57:05.589,00:57:07.049,How much is that check for?
00:57:07.215,00:57:09.259,"Kid, I'm really not in the mood for this right now."
00:57:09.343,00:57:12.471,-This Skywayman's driving me crazy. -Who's the Skywayman?
00:57:12.596,00:57:15.682,"Some nut that's flying around the country, posing as a Pan Am pilot."
00:57:26.985,00:57:28.695,This guy doesn't even fly Pan Am.
00:57:29.029,00:57:31.782,"Flies everybody else. Flies United, TWA."
00:57:32.157,00:57:33.867,"Continental, Eastern."
00:57:34.201,00:57:35.619,The Skywayman.
00:57:36.411,00:57:38.038,Newspaper loves this clown.
00:57:39.539,00:57:41.416,They call him the James Bond of the sky.
00:57:44.461,00:57:45.337,Did you say...?
00:57:45.712,00:57:47.172,"Bond, James Bond."
00:58:03.522,00:58:06.316,"Do you want to play it easy, or the hard way?"
00:58:06.608,00:58:08.276,And this isn't a tranquilizer.
00:58:08.360,00:58:11.113,"Pussy, you know a lot more about planes than guns."
00:58:16.535,00:58:17.411,Positive.
00:58:17.661,00:58:19.621,It's the exact suit he wore in the movie.
00:58:19.871,00:58:21.957,Okay. I'll take three.
00:58:22.207,00:58:23.542,"Certainly, Mr. Fleming."
00:58:24.167,00:58:27.629,Now all you need is one of those little foreign sports cars that he drives.
00:59:01.413,00:59:02.789,Haven't I seen you before?
00:59:05.792,00:59:06.752,Maybe.
00:59:07.669,00:59:10.255,A couple of years ago I was on the cover of Seventeen.
00:59:16.428,00:59:18.638,Guys used to put your picture on their lockers.
00:59:21.266,00:59:23.727,Isn't that your silver car I saw parked out front?
00:59:24.478,00:59:26.605,Yeah. One of them.
00:59:30.817,00:59:33.487,"So, think I could get an autograph?"
00:59:38.033,00:59:39.409,Do you have a pen in your room?
01:00:15.195,01:00:16.154,Shh...
01:00:18.698,01:00:21.034,A man like you can buy anything he wants.
01:00:33.213,01:00:35.715,He buys a deck of cards at the hotel gift shop.
01:00:39.344,01:00:41.221,You want to see a card trick?
01:00:43.223,01:00:44.724,How much did these cards cost?
01:00:47.102,01:00:49.062,"I don't know, 55 cents, I think."
01:00:52.732,01:00:56.695,And if they sold me downstairs at the hotel gift shop...
01:00:58.738,01:01:00.031,how much would you pay?
01:01:01.408,01:01:02.367,I'm...
01:01:03.368,01:01:06.163,"I'm sorry, how much would I pay for what?"
01:01:09.499,01:01:10.667,The entire night.
01:01:13.253,01:01:16.214,How much would you pay me for the entire night?
01:01:21.011,01:01:23.763,"Cheryl, I really don't know."
01:01:25.974,01:01:27.184,Don't be scared.
01:01:32.272,01:01:33.523,Make me an offer.
01:01:41.698,01:01:42.824,Three hundred?
01:01:44.492,01:01:46.077,Go fish.
01:01:49.414,01:01:51.124,"Uh, five hundred dollars?"
01:01:52.209,01:01:53.210,Go fish.
01:02:02.802,01:02:03.970,A thousand dollars.
01:02:06.681,01:02:07.641,Okay.
01:02:09.809,01:02:11.061,A thousand dollars.
01:02:13.355,01:02:16.483,Okay. I'll be right back.
01:02:17.525,01:02:19.486,"Wait a second, where are you going?"
01:02:19.569,01:02:21.488,I'm going downstairs to cash a check.
01:02:25.742,01:02:26.993,at 3 a.m.?
01:02:30.121,01:02:33.500,It's a New York Savings and Loan check. It's like gold. They'll cash it.
01:02:34.042,01:02:37.128,Don't you think they might get a little suspicious? Let me see that.
01:02:39.756,01:02:41.716,It's a cashier's check. Endorse it over to me.
01:02:41.800,01:02:43.927,No. I couldn't do that.
01:02:44.594,01:02:47.639,"See, this check is for 1,400. We agreed upon 1,000."
01:02:49.307,01:02:54.437,Why don't I give you back 400 and you give me that check?
01:02:56.314,01:02:57.232,Even better.
01:03:29.723,01:03:31.099,Does this belong to anybody?
01:03:52.579,01:03:53.496,Hello.
01:03:55.957,01:03:58.293,"Barry Allen, Secret Service."
01:03:59.085,01:04:02.464,I've been trying to track you down now for the last couple of hours.
01:04:03.173,01:04:04.174,What do you want?
01:04:05.258,01:04:08.845,I wanted to apologize for what happened out in Los Angeles.
01:04:12.849,01:04:14.976,"Do you always work on Christmas Eve, Carl?"
01:04:15.560,01:04:19.606,"I volunteered, so the men with families could go home early."
01:04:20.523,01:04:23.026,Looked like you were wearing a wedding ring out in Los Angeles.
01:04:23.109,01:04:26.446,"-I thought maybe you had a family. -No, no family."
01:04:28.448,01:04:31.868,You want to talk to me? Let's talk face to face.
01:04:32.243,01:04:33.244,All right.
01:04:33.870,01:04:37.332,"I'm at my suite at the Stuyvesant Arms, Room 3113."
01:04:37.707,01:04:40.085,In the morning I leave for Las Vegas for the weekend.
01:04:43.046,01:04:44.672,You think you're gonna get me again?
01:04:46.257,01:04:49.260,"You're not going to Vegas, you're not in the Stuyvesant Arms."
01:04:50.887,01:04:55.266,"You'd love for me to send out 20 agents, Christmas Eve, barge into your hotel..."
01:04:56.017,01:04:58.478,knock down the door so you can make fools out of us all.
01:04:59.229,01:05:02.440,I'm really sorry if I made a fool out of you. I really am.
01:05:02.524,01:05:04.818,"-Uh-uh, no. No, no. -No, listen, I really am."
01:05:04.984,01:05:07.070,You do not feel sorry for me.
01:05:07.529,01:05:09.447,"The truth is, I knew it was you."
01:05:09.531,01:05:11.699,"Maybe I didn't get the cuffs on you, but I knew."
01:05:12.909,01:05:15.120,"People only know what you tell them, Carl."
01:05:16.746,01:05:19.874,"Well, then tell me this, Barry Allen, Secret Service."
01:05:20.458,01:05:22.377,How did you know I wouldn't look in your wallet?
01:05:23.211,01:05:25.505,The same reason the Yankees always win.
01:05:26.506,01:05:29.384,Nobody can keep their eyes off the pinstripes.
01:05:29.843,01:05:32.095,The Yankees win because they have Mickey Mantle.
01:05:32.637,01:05:34.347,No one ever bets on the uniform.
01:05:37.809,01:05:41.396,I'll tell you what I am sure of. You're gonna get caught.
01:05:42.730,01:05:46.192,"One way or another, it's a mathematical fact. It's like Vegas."
01:05:46.359,01:05:47.610,The house always wins.
01:05:53.366,01:05:57.078,"Well, Carl, I'm sorry, but I have to go."
01:06:10.091,01:06:11.134,Whoa!
01:06:45.084,01:06:46.169,"More coffee, sir?"
01:06:52.884,01:06:55.345,-Are you a collector? -Of what?
01:06:56.012,01:07:00.058,"Captives of the Cosmic Ray, The Big Freeze, Land of the Golden Giants. I've got them all."
01:07:07.190,01:07:08.149,The Flash.
01:07:10.401,01:07:11.819,"Wait, kid. Kid! Kid."
01:07:14.489,01:07:16.824,"-You mean, like the comic book? -Yeah, the comic book."
01:07:16.908,01:07:19.160,"When he's not The Flash, that's his name, Barry Allen."
01:07:20.912,01:07:21.829,Thank you.
01:07:26.334,01:07:29.212,"Now get this, he reads comic books!"
01:07:29.587,01:07:32.048,Comic books! Barry Allen is The Flash!
01:07:34.342,01:07:36.344,"He's a kid, our unsub is a kid."
01:07:36.469,01:07:39.097,"That's why we couldn't match his prints, that's why he doesn't have a record."
01:07:39.180,01:07:44.310,I want you to contact NYPD for every all-points juvenile runaways in New York City.
01:07:44.394,01:07:47.689,Don't forget the airports. He's been kiting checks all over the country.
01:07:47.814,01:07:49.732,-Why New York? -The Yankees!
01:07:49.899,01:07:52.277,He said something about the Yankees!
01:08:04.747,01:08:05.957,"Yes, I've been waiting."
01:08:06.958,01:08:09.586,I hope you're all hungry. I put out the Sara Lee.
01:08:15.258,01:08:17.885,"What about your first husband, Mrs. Abagnahlee?"
01:08:18.052,01:08:21.931,Abagnale. But I prefer to be called Barnes.
01:08:23.683,01:08:26.769,Frank William Abagnale. It says here he was in the service.
01:08:26.853,01:08:28.730,Did you two meet during the war?
01:08:29.772,01:08:33.818,"Yeah, I lived in a very small village in France, Montrichard."
01:08:34.360,01:08:37.530,The kind of place where they never heard of Sara Lee.
01:08:39.699,01:08:41.367,Nobody doesn't like Sara Lee.
01:08:41.576,01:08:46.748,"You filled out a missing person's report for a runaway juvenile by the name of Frank Abagnale, Jr."
01:08:47.248,01:08:48.374,Is Frankie okay?
01:08:49.167,01:08:53.212,You're aware of the fact that he wrote some checks on a closed account at Chase Manhattan bank?
01:08:57.008,01:08:59.385,"What he did was a felony, Mrs. Barnes."
01:09:02.305,01:09:06.184,"Half the kids his age are on dope, throwing rocks at police."
01:09:06.559,01:09:10.063,And they scared me to death because my son made a little mistake.
01:09:12.148,01:09:16.986,"A 17-year-old boy has to eat, has to have a place to sleep."
01:09:17.403,01:09:18.821,"We understand, ma'am."
01:09:19.822,01:09:21.491,Would you happen to have a picture of your son?
01:09:21.783,01:09:23.409,"Yes, I have his old yearbook."
01:09:33.169,01:09:36.255,"Okay. Okay, okay. We..."
01:09:36.673,01:09:39.258,We need to send out an all-office teletype.
01:09:39.676,01:09:42.679,"Our unsub's name is Frank Abagnale, Jr., age 17!"
01:09:43.179,01:09:45.306,Is Frankie okay? Is he in trouble?
01:09:45.390,01:09:48.059,"Ma'am, I'm sorry to have to tell you, your son is forging checks."
01:09:48.267,01:09:51.396,Forging checks? Wait! I'm sure we can take care of that.
01:09:51.479,01:09:53.356,"I'm working part-time at the church, now."
01:09:53.439,01:09:55.817,Just tell me how much he owes and I'll pay you back.
01:09:56.025,01:09:58.277,"So far, it's about 1.3 million dollars."
01:10:17.714,01:10:19.882,"When you're in the house, please just use an ashtray."
01:10:20.091,01:10:21.884,"Frank, this fondue is so good!"
01:10:22.051,01:10:24.887,"-Great. Here, take this. -Good, I love Möet!"
01:10:33.146,01:10:37.608,"James, please! Just stay away from the hi-fi system, all right?"
01:10:37.692,01:10:39.819,"It's reel-to-reel, you can't wind it like that."
01:10:43.614,01:10:46.576,Christ! Terry! This is Italian knit!
01:10:46.743,01:10:48.995,"-Watch where you're going! -It's just a shirt, man!"
01:10:49.328,01:10:51.664,Frank! Come quick!
01:10:52.123,01:10:54.959,Lance just fell into the conversation pit!
01:11:00.923,01:11:02.967,"Excuse me, you know where Lance Applebaum is?"
01:11:03.468,01:11:04.343,Thank you.
01:11:08.014,01:11:10.266,Do you understand how dangerous this is? Do you?
01:11:10.349,01:11:11.392,Don't stand there and cry.
01:11:11.517,01:11:13.603,Just nod your head and tell me you won't do it again.
01:11:24.322,01:11:26.866,"He told me to pick up the blood, so I did."
01:11:30.369,01:11:33.790,"It's okay, stop crying. What's your name?"
01:11:35.291,01:11:36.959,-Brenda. -Brenda.
01:11:39.170,01:11:43.716,"Brenda, I wouldn't worry about it. You know, these doctors, you know, they don't know everything."
01:11:44.801,01:11:48.513,It's my first week. I think they're gonna fire me.
01:11:51.766,01:11:53.559,I bet you're good at your job.
01:11:54.852,01:11:56.270,"No, I'm not."
01:11:57.396,01:12:04.320,"Yeah, I bet if I asked you to check on the status of my friend Lance Applebaum, that you could do that for me in a second."
01:12:06.823,01:12:08.741,Nurse Fitzsimmons to recovery.
01:12:12.912,01:12:15.748,Mr. Applebaum fractured his ankle.
01:12:15.873,01:12:19.710,Dr. Ashland is treating him in exam room seven.
01:12:19.794,01:12:22.255,You see that? No problem.
01:12:24.257,01:12:26.050,This is the emergency chart.
01:12:27.093,01:12:30.972,See that blue star there? That means that the patient has been diagnosed.
01:12:31.138,01:12:35.518,"And then after he's been treated, we put a red circle here. See?"
01:12:36.894,01:12:38.145,How you like those braces?
01:12:40.690,01:12:42.108,I guess they're all right.
01:12:42.942,01:12:44.819,I got mine off last year.
01:12:45.945,01:12:48.030,"Boy, I hated them. They were bottoms."
01:12:48.656,01:12:50.575,I still got to wear my mouth guard.
01:12:51.909,01:12:53.494,You have really nice teeth.
01:12:55.538,01:12:59.041,"Well, thank you. And you have a pretty smile."
01:13:03.462,01:13:06.424,"No, I mean it. I really think those braces look good on you."
01:13:07.592,01:13:09.927,-Thank you. -You're welcome.
01:13:14.140,01:13:16.225,-Brenda. -Yeah.
01:13:16.893,01:13:19.020,Do you know if they're hiring here at the hospital?
01:13:21.147,01:13:24.066,I'm not sure. What do you want to do?
01:13:25.943,01:13:27.028,I'm a doctor.
01:13:32.950,01:13:35.411,I've decided to get off the road for a while.
01:13:35.661,01:13:39.206,I've taken a night job at a hospital and met some really nice people.
01:13:39.624,01:13:43.544,"Feels good to have my feet on the ground, to wake up in the same bed every night."
01:13:45.129,01:13:48.549,"Who knows, maybe I'll even find someone to settle down with."
01:13:51.594,01:13:54.722,Harvard Medical School. Top of your class.
01:13:56.098,01:13:58.225,Southern California Children's Hospital.
01:13:59.018,01:14:02.104,"That's a pretty impressive résumé, Dr. Conners."
01:14:02.647,01:14:06.651,"Unfortunately, the only thing I need is..."
01:14:07.401,01:14:11.530,an emergency room supervisor for my midnight to eight a.m. shift.
01:14:12.782,01:14:15.993,Someone to babysit six interns and 20 nurses.
01:14:16.786,01:14:17.703,But...
01:14:20.039,01:14:23.000,"Hell, I doubt that you'd be interested in that."
01:14:24.585,01:14:28.798,"Well, in the past, they've always let me choose my own nurses."
01:14:39.892,01:14:43.562,"-You gonna take roll every night? -Yes, I will, Dr. Ashland."
01:14:43.854,01:14:46.983,"And if you're gonna be late, I suggest you bring a note."
01:14:50.653,01:14:51.821,Miss Basmann.
01:14:52.863,01:14:53.906,Miss Mace.
01:14:54.824,01:14:57.201,-Miss Strong. -Here.
01:14:57.535,01:14:58.703,Nurse Brown.
01:15:04.542,01:15:08.337,Run the plasma to 60 drops a minute till we calculate the fluid requirements.
01:15:08.587,01:15:11.507,"What do you estimate the degree and extent of the burns, Kildare?"
01:15:13.676,01:15:15.386,over about 20 percent of the body surface.
01:15:15.469,01:15:16.846,-Do you concur? -I concur.
01:15:16.929,01:15:18.514,Let's get him up to pediatrics.
01:15:25.646,01:15:27.982,"-Hello, Brenda. -Hi, Dr. Conners."
01:15:28.983,01:15:31.277,-You need to sign these. -Thank you.
01:15:38.868,01:15:40.453,Do you notice anything different about me?
01:15:40.578,01:15:42.455,-You got your braces off! -Yeah!
01:15:42.705,01:15:45.207,"-Come here, let me see. -I've been trying to show you all night!"
01:15:46.542,01:15:49.587,-Wow. Good job. -Yeah.
01:15:49.670,01:15:52.381,"So, did it hurt when they took them off? Mine felt so weird after."
01:15:52.465,01:15:55.134,I keep rubbing my tongue over them. I can't stop!
01:15:55.551,01:15:57.011,They're so slippery.
01:15:57.094,01:16:00.056,"-It feels good, though, doesn't it? -Yeah, it feels incredible."
01:16:10.566,01:16:11.567,"Oh, my."
01:16:13.277,01:16:14.195,I'm sorry.
01:16:29.919,01:16:31.003,Shouldn't you go?
01:16:31.087,01:16:35.883,"No. No, no. They have a staff doctor in the emergency ward, we'll be fine."
01:16:42.181,01:16:44.100,What if he's in surgery?
01:16:45.810,01:16:47.311,Do you really think I have to go?
01:17:06.872,01:17:10.334,"Gentlemen, what seems to be the problem?"
01:17:11.085,01:17:15.548,Bicycle accident. A fractured tibia about five inches below the patella.
01:17:20.970,01:17:22.429,-Dr. Harris. -Yes?
01:17:22.596,01:17:23.639,Do you concur?
01:17:25.015,01:17:26.725,"Concur with what, sir?"
01:17:27.685,01:17:30.813,With what Dr. Ashland just said. Do you concur?
01:17:32.231,01:17:35.901,"Uh. Well, it was a bicycle accident. The boy told us."
01:17:36.902,01:17:37.987,So you concur?
01:17:39.405,01:17:43.701,"-Concur? -I think we should take an X-ray, then stitch him up and put him in a walking cast."
01:17:47.538,01:17:49.248,"Very good, Dr. Ashland. Very good."
01:17:49.415,01:17:52.042,"Well, you don't seem to have much need for me."
01:17:52.668,01:17:53.669,Carry on.
01:17:56.130,01:17:57.590,"Blew it, didn't I?"
01:17:58.841,01:18:00.259,Why didn't I concur?
01:18:25.576,01:18:28.454,"-Frank Abagnale, Sr. -You're not a cop."
01:18:30.623,01:18:32.583,"Special Agent Hanratty, FBI."
01:18:33.334,01:18:36.253,You're not a cop. My landlord said you were not a cop.
01:18:36.921,01:18:40.549,"Well, if you're gonna arrest me, I'd like to put on a different suit."
01:18:40.633,01:18:42.760,-If that's okay with you. -I'm not here to arrest you.
01:18:42.843,01:18:44.845,I'm looking for your son. He's in trouble.
01:18:45.304,01:18:46.263,Do you know where he is?
01:18:49.475,01:18:52.311,"If I tell you where he is, will you promise not to tell his mother?"
01:18:53.020,01:18:53.938,Sure.
01:18:55.356,01:18:59.526,Frank made up a fake ID and enlisted in the Marine Corps.
01:18:59.610,01:19:01.528,He's over in Vietnam right now.
01:19:01.612,01:19:07.910,"That kid is halfway around the world crawling through the damn jungle, fighting the Communists, so..."
01:19:09.411,01:19:13.832,"Please, don't come to my home and call my boy a criminal because that kid has guts."
01:19:13.916,01:19:17.586,"I never said he was a criminal, Mr. Abagnale. I said he was in trouble."
01:19:18.879,01:19:21.966,"If you'd like to give me a call and talk, here's my number."
01:19:34.603,01:19:35.896,"You're not a father, are you?"
01:19:38.607,01:19:41.652,"-Pardon me? -If you were a father, you'd know."
01:19:42.319,01:19:44.321,I would never give up my son.
01:19:49.702,01:19:51.537,"Yes, sir. I understand."
01:19:52.746,01:19:54.707,"Sean. Sean, now get this..."
01:19:54.957,01:19:59.628,"Riverbend Apartments, 415 Landover, Atlanta, Georgia."
01:20:00.087,01:20:03.173,"Atlanta, Georgia. Yeah, I'm on my way to the airport."
01:20:03.257,01:20:06.593,I'll meet the team in four hours. Bye-bye!
01:20:12.099,01:20:13.309,You don't have to cry.
01:20:21.108,01:20:24.445,"I don't care if you're a virgin, all right? Really, I can wait."
01:20:32.036,01:20:34.288,I had an abortion two years ago.
01:20:38.083,01:20:40.419,My parents had a friend do it.
01:20:41.378,01:20:44.506,A man that my father plays golf with.
01:20:45.799,01:20:48.719,"And then when I got better, they kicked me out of the house."
01:20:53.432,01:20:55.476,-Hey... -I'm so sorry.
01:20:55.601,01:20:57.519,Please don't be mad at me. Please.
01:20:57.603,01:21:00.064,"-Please don't be mad at me. -No, no."
01:21:00.356,01:21:02.316,-Please don't be mad at me. -Shh.
01:21:02.858,01:21:06.612,"Now, what if I spoke to your parents, right?"
01:21:09.406,01:21:12.743,I ask them all the time but they said I still can't come home.
01:21:13.952,01:21:16.955,And my daddy's a lawyer.
01:21:25.339,01:21:26.340,Brenda?
01:21:28.967,01:21:30.969,What if you were engaged to a doctor?
01:21:32.471,01:21:35.432,-Would that change anything? -What?
01:21:39.395,01:21:41.188,What if I went to your parents...
01:21:43.315,01:21:44.942,and I spoke to your father...
01:21:49.029,01:21:50.697,and I asked permission to marry you?
01:22:31.822,01:22:34.032,"Dr. Conners, are you Lutheran?"
01:22:35.701,01:22:39.663,"Yes, I am a Lutheran. But please, call me Frank."
01:22:41.081,01:22:43.041,"Frank, would you like to say grace?"
01:22:49.173,01:22:50.757,Unless you're not comfortable.
01:22:51.884,01:22:53.010,Absolutely.
01:23:03.854,01:23:06.815,Two little mice fell into a bucket of cream.
01:23:08.817,01:23:17.618,"The first mouse quickly gave up and drowned but the second mouse, he struggled so hard that he eventually churned that cream into butter and he walked out."
01:23:19.244,01:23:20.245,Amen.
01:23:21.205,01:23:24.541,"-Amen. -Amen. Oh, that was beautiful."
01:23:25.209,01:23:27.294,"The mouse, he churned that cream into butter."
01:23:28.337,01:23:29.338,Oh...
01:23:30.672,01:23:31.757,That's right.
01:23:33.383,01:23:34.301,Thank you.
01:23:34.801,01:23:37.971,"Frank, have you decided which hospital you want to work at here in New Orleans?"
01:23:38.555,01:23:43.435,"Well, to be quite honest, I'm thinking about getting back into law."
01:23:44.269,01:23:47.397,"Oh, my. Are you a doctor or a lawyer?"
01:23:47.731,01:23:51.068,"Well, before I went to medical school I passed the bar in California."
01:23:51.443,01:23:53.779,"I practiced law for one year, then I decided..."
01:23:54.446,01:23:56.448,why not try my hand at pediatrics?
01:23:58.116,01:23:59.993,You're just full of surprises!
01:24:01.286,01:24:02.329,Yeah.
01:24:02.829,01:24:07.000,"Oh, my. A doctor and a lawyer. I say that Brenda hit the jackpot."
01:24:07.459,01:24:09.044,Where did you go to law school?
01:24:12.881,01:24:15.133,"Berkeley. Berkeley. Oh, my gosh, isn't that where you went, Daddy?"
01:24:15.342,01:24:17.636,"Maybe Frank could come work for you, Roger."
01:24:17.719,01:24:20.472,You were always saying how hard it is to find assistant prosecutors.
01:24:20.681,01:24:23.809,"Could he, Daddy? Could he, please? Could he come work with you please?"
01:24:23.892,01:24:27.854,Was that snake Hollingsworth still teaching there when you went through Berkeley?
01:24:30.065,01:24:31.817,Hollingsworth. Yes.
01:24:31.984,01:24:34.987,"Grumpy old Hollingsworth, right? I tell you, meaner than ever."
01:24:35.779,01:24:37.197,And that dog of his?
01:24:40.576,01:24:43.912,"Tell me, Frank, what was the name of his little dog?"
01:24:53.505,01:24:54.840,"I'm sorry, uh..."
01:24:56.883,01:24:58.218,The dog was dead.
01:25:01.763,01:25:02.973,How unfortunate.
01:25:04.725,01:25:05.684,Yeah.
01:25:36.089,01:25:38.800,"A doctor, a lawyer, a Lutheran."
01:25:41.678,01:25:43.096,"So, what are you, Frank?"
01:25:44.640,01:25:49.436,"Because I think you're about to ask for my daughter's hand in marriage, and I have a right to know."
01:25:50.020,01:25:51.188,"Know what, sir?"
01:25:52.272,01:25:53.315,The truth.
01:25:55.984,01:25:57.819,"Tell me the truth, Frank."
01:25:59.237,01:26:00.614,What are you doing here?
01:26:03.158,01:26:05.452,What is a man like you doing with Brenda?
01:26:16.338,01:26:17.839,"The truth is, sir, that..."
01:26:22.010,01:26:23.387,The truth is that...
01:26:26.473,01:26:29.017,"I'm not a doctor, I'm not a lawyer."
01:26:31.770,01:26:33.355,I'm not an airline pilot.
01:26:34.523,01:26:37.109,"I'm... I'm nothing, really."
01:26:44.908,01:26:47.077,I'm just a kid who's in love with your daughter.
01:26:50.288,01:26:51.248,No.
01:27:00.924,01:27:02.342,You know what you are?
01:27:03.301,01:27:04.720,You're a romantic.
01:27:05.137,01:27:07.973,Men like us are nothing without the women we love.
01:27:08.348,01:27:11.935,"I must confess, I'm guilty of the same foolish whimsy."
01:27:12.018,01:27:18.734,"I proposed to Carol after five dates, with two nickels in my pockets and holes in my shoes, because I knew she was the one."
01:27:19.985,01:27:21.319,"So go ahead, Frank."
01:27:25.574,01:27:26.742,Don't be afraid.
01:27:27.534,01:27:29.828,Ask the question you came here to ask me.
01:27:32.998,01:27:33.874,Sir...
01:27:35.542,01:27:39.129,what would I have to do to take the bar here in New Orleans?
01:27:44.050,01:27:46.052,"No, the other question."
01:27:55.687,01:27:58.774,"-Good luck, Mr. Conners. -Thank you."
01:28:07.199,01:28:10.494,"Hey, Frank. You know what I could never figure out?"
01:28:11.453,01:28:13.455,How did you cheat on the bar exam in Louisiana?
01:28:14.331,01:28:15.665,"Why, what's the difference?"
01:28:16.208,01:28:17.793,"Someone else took the test for you, didn't they?"
01:28:17.918,01:28:19.836,"Carl, I'm going to prison for a long time."
01:28:20.712,01:28:22.172,"Seriously, what's the difference?"
01:28:23.507,01:28:24.841,It's a simple question.
01:28:26.551,01:28:28.011,Are you gonna eat that éclair?
01:28:30.806,01:28:33.517,Yeah. I'm saving it for later.
01:28:34.476,01:28:37.312,-Don't you want to split it with me? -No.
01:28:41.149,01:28:43.068,Give me half that éclair and I'll tell you.
01:28:54.704,01:28:56.581,I'm gonna figure it out sooner or later.
01:29:03.547,01:29:07.217,You'll be working under Phillip Rigby in corporate law.
01:29:07.592,01:29:10.262,"Why don't you settle in, organize your desk."
01:29:13.098,01:29:19.771,-Thank you. -We're having lunch at 12:30 with the Attorney General and Governor McKeithen himself.
01:29:20.397,01:29:21.481,The governor!
01:29:21.815,01:29:24.234,-Did we spell it right? -You sure did.
01:29:29.281,01:29:30.240,Now...
01:29:36.204,01:29:38.248,"Look at this photograph, Mr. Stewart."
01:29:39.249,01:29:43.336,"It's a photograph of Prentice York, where they found him, dead."
01:29:43.628,01:29:46.256,"Now, here is an enlargement of part of that photograph."
01:29:47.007,01:29:50.302,This is a photograph of the defendant's signature on a canceled check.
01:29:50.468,01:30:01.730,"Now, here is an enlargement of that same signature, which matches the signature on the letters that he wrote to Mrs. Simon which discuss the possibility of defrauding the great state of Louisiana."
01:30:02.063,01:30:09.362,"Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is irrefutable evidence that the defendant is, in fact, lying."
01:30:15.493,01:30:19.289,"Mr. Conners, this is a preliminary hearing."
01:30:20.248,01:30:23.084,There is no... defendant.
01:30:24.669,01:30:27.756,There is no... jury.
01:30:29.466,01:30:30.759,It's just me.
01:30:32.093,01:30:36.097,"Son, what in the hell is wrong with you?"
01:30:40.727,01:30:43.939,"-It's Mitch! -Oh, my, I lost all track of time."
01:30:46.441,01:30:49.819,we have the children's choir of Saint Monica's Church in New York City.
01:30:49.986,01:30:53.907,Won't you join them and the gang in a few songs for the Irish? Everybody!
01:32:25.040,01:32:25.957,Dad?
01:32:30.670,01:32:31.921,What are you doing here?
01:32:33.798,01:32:35.592,I... I came to see you.
01:32:40.221,01:32:41.890,What are you doing dressed like this?
01:32:42.057,01:32:44.184,I took a job. Government job.
01:32:44.267,01:32:46.936,You see what I'm doing? Do you have a good lawyer?
01:32:47.645,01:32:50.398,Well... I sort of am a lawyer now.
01:32:50.482,01:32:53.151,Look at this letter. The IRS wants more.
01:32:53.985,01:32:56.279,I had a deal with them. Two penalties.
01:32:56.529,01:32:58.865,"They ate the cake, now they want the crumbs."
01:32:59.908,01:33:01.117,I want to sue them.
01:33:02.744,01:33:04.370,Now they want the crumbs.
01:33:05.747,01:33:07.415,"They... Here, sit down."
01:33:12.962,01:33:15.757,You know what? I'll make them chase me...
01:33:16.925,01:33:18.384,for the rest of their lives!
01:33:25.016,01:33:27.435,"Hey, it's great to see you, Daddy."
01:33:29.771,01:33:32.774,"Sit down, I want to show you something."
01:33:34.943,01:33:36.528,I came here to give you this.
01:33:37.195,01:33:39.656,It's an invitation to an engagement party.
01:33:42.909,01:33:44.452,"Daddy, I'm getting married."
01:33:48.248,01:33:50.625,"You don't need to worry about anything now, Dad."
01:33:50.875,01:33:55.004,"Listen, I'm getting a brand-new Cadillac, I'm getting a 60,000-dollar house."
01:33:55.088,01:33:56.840,I'm getting it all back.
01:33:57.006,01:33:59.342,"All the jewelry, all the furs, everything, Dad."
01:33:59.425,01:34:01.678,"Everything they took from us, I'm gonna get it back."
01:34:05.265,01:34:07.225,has Ma seen you dressed like this?
01:34:08.560,01:34:10.687,"Yeah, she came to pick up some boxes."
01:34:11.396,01:34:13.231,That's okay. That's okay. You know why?
01:34:13.314,01:34:15.358,Because she's going to the wedding with us.
01:34:15.733,01:34:18.611,"I'm gonna get you a brand-new suit, Dad. Getting you a brand-new suit."
01:34:18.736,01:34:22.407,"One of those Manhattan Eagle three-button black pearl suits, you'll look great."
01:34:22.490,01:34:24.742,Those are nice. She won't see me.
01:34:27.912,01:34:29.330,Have you tried to call her?
01:34:31.457,01:34:33.418,Why don't you call her right now?
01:34:34.544,01:34:36.087,Why don't you call her right now? Here.
01:34:39.841,01:34:45.638,"You call her, you tell her I have two first-class tickets to go see her son's wedding-- You mother's married now to my friend Jack Barnes."
01:34:45.722,01:34:47.515,They have a house in Long Island.
01:34:53.521,01:34:56.274,"You got their number, son. The guy looked scared."
01:34:57.358,01:35:01.029,"The United States government, Champ, running for the hills."
01:35:01.738,01:35:03.239,Pow! To the moon.
01:35:15.293,01:35:18.087,Dad. It's over.
01:35:19.797,01:35:23.092,-I'm gonna stop now. -But you've...
01:35:24.427,01:35:26.054,"They're never gonna catch you, Frank."
01:35:28.514,01:35:29.807,Why would she do that to you?
01:35:29.891,01:35:32.518,"Come on, sit with me. Have a drink. I'm your father."
01:35:34.270,01:35:35.688,Then ask me to stop.
01:35:36.731,01:35:38.274,Then ask me to stop.
01:35:41.819,01:35:42.904,You can't stop.
01:35:45.949,01:35:47.075,Where you going?
01:35:48.034,01:35:49.494,"Come on, Frank, where you going?"
01:35:53.790,01:35:56.834,Someplace exotic? Where you going tonight? Tahiti? Hawaii?
01:36:14.894,01:36:16.104,This is Hanratty.
01:36:21.859,01:36:23.236,"How are you, Dr. Conners?"
01:36:32.495,01:36:34.789,I'm sitting here in my office on Christmas Eve.
01:36:48.845,01:36:50.388,I want it to be over.
01:36:53.850,01:36:57.687,Uh-huh. I want it to be over. I'm getting married.
01:36:58.354,01:36:59.981,"You know, I'm settling down."
01:37:00.440,01:37:02.483,You've stolen almost four million dollars.
01:37:02.942,01:37:05.194,Think we could just call that a wedding present?
01:37:05.278,01:37:07.363,"No, this isn't something you get to walk away from, Frank."
01:37:10.283,01:37:13.369,You will be caught. You will go to prison. Where did you think this was going?
01:37:14.412,01:37:15.913,"Please leave me alone, Carl."
01:37:17.373,01:37:18.416,Please?
01:37:19.125,01:37:20.460,"I'm getting close, aren't I?"
01:37:21.377,01:37:23.421,You're scared because I'm getting close. I know you...
01:37:23.963,01:37:28.343,"You rented that car in Shreveport, you stayed at that hotel on Lake Charles."
01:37:29.260,01:37:33.097,"You want to run, be my guest. Your checks don't lie as well as you do."
01:37:33.973,01:37:35.558,Stop chasing me.
01:37:38.770,01:37:39.896,I can't stop.
01:37:41.606,01:37:42.690,It's my job.
01:37:44.233,01:37:45.401,"It's okay, Carl."
01:37:52.408,01:37:55.953,"Hey. Merry Christmas, huh?"
01:37:59.749,01:38:00.917,I love my job.
01:38:02.710,01:38:03.878,All right.
01:38:04.504,01:38:09.050,"Let's get every newspaper we can, every newspaper in Louisiana -for the last two months. -What're we looking for?"
01:38:09.175,01:38:11.511,Engagement announcements. Name of Conners.
01:38:11.594,01:38:15.098,"Conners? Come on, Carl, the kid would have changed his name by now."
01:38:15.598,01:38:17.725,Mm-mm. He can't change it.
01:38:18.726,01:38:22.230,"She thinks he's Conners. If he loses the name, he loses the girl."
01:38:40.164,01:38:41.290,"Keep dancing, huh?"
01:38:47.672,01:38:49.841,-I'm going to the little boys' room. -Okay!
01:39:10.403,01:39:12.530,We'd like to have a few quiet words with your host if possible.
01:39:16.576,01:39:18.786,"-Right over there, sir. -Hi, Roger, how are you?"
01:39:18.870,01:39:19.954,"Hi, Ben."
01:39:20.955,01:39:22.748,"Good evening, gentlemen. I'm Roger Strong."
01:39:22.832,01:39:26.461,"Carl Hanratty, FBI. This is Agents Amdursky and Fox."
01:39:27.253,01:39:31.007,"-Sorry to crash your party, sir. -Not at all. What can I do for you?"
01:39:31.090,01:39:33.342,"If it's not too much trouble, I'd like to meet the groom."
01:39:34.427,01:39:35.595,Is there a problem?
01:39:38.806,01:39:41.517,"-Frank! Can you hold all these? -Yeah, come here."
01:39:41.642,01:39:43.561,They're checks. They're from my dad's friends.
01:39:43.644,01:39:45.646,"They're for us, so we can start our new life, hey!"
01:39:45.730,01:39:48.441,-Brenda... -What are you doing? What's wrong?
01:39:48.524,01:39:50.443,-We have to leave. -What?
01:39:55.031,01:39:57.116,"-I mean, you love me no matter what. -Yeah."
01:39:57.241,01:40:01.037,"I mean, you'd love me whether I was sick or whether I was poor, or even if I had a different name."
01:40:03.039,01:40:06.209,"Brenda, listen. A name, right? A name, it doesn't matter."
01:40:06.292,01:40:08.461,"My name is Frank Conners, right? That's who I am with you."
01:40:08.544,01:40:10.087,But we all have secrets.
01:40:10.379,01:40:12.798,"You know, sometimes when I travel, I use the name Frank Taylor."
01:40:12.882,01:40:14.300,-That's my secret. -Frank Taylor?
01:40:14.383,01:40:16.427,"Yeah, Frank Taylor, you know. Frank Black."
01:40:16.511,01:40:18.262,"-Frank Black? -Yeah, it doesn't matter."
01:40:18.846,01:40:21.349,-Why are you saying all this? -Brenda.
01:40:22.266,01:40:24.644,"Brenda, I don't want to lie to you anymore. All right?"
01:40:24.894,01:40:26.938,"I'm not a doctor, I never went to medical school."
01:40:27.021,01:40:30.149,I'm not a lawyer or a Harvard graduate or a Lutheran.
01:40:30.316,01:40:33.402,"Brenda, I ran away from home a year and a half ago when I was 16."
01:40:39.659,01:40:40.826,You're not a Lutheran?
01:40:41.661,01:40:45.790,"Brenda, you see all this money? You see all this money? I have more."
01:40:46.332,01:40:47.542,I have plenty more.
01:40:48.918,01:40:51.629,I have enough money to last us for the rest of our lives.
01:40:53.464,01:40:56.592,"Frank, stop teasing me! You're Frank Conners."
01:40:56.676,01:40:59.220,You're Frank Conners and you're 28 years old.
01:41:01.389,01:41:02.723,Why would you lie to me?
01:41:03.307,01:41:05.643,-Brenda. -I want to know your name.
01:41:05.726,01:41:07.270,-Listen to me. -Tell me your name.
01:41:07.436,01:41:10.648,"We can live anywhere we want. But you have to trust me, Brenda."
01:41:10.898,01:41:12.149,-Do you trust me? -Yes.
01:41:12.233,01:41:15.152,"-Do you love me, Brenda? You love me? -Yes. I love you."
01:41:16.028,01:41:17.196,"Excuse me, Mother."
01:41:18.573,01:41:20.783,"This is Mr. Hanratty. My wife, Carol."
01:41:20.908,01:41:22.410,"-Mr... -Hanratty, ma'am."
01:41:22.493,01:41:23.536,-Ratty? -Yes.
01:41:23.619,01:41:26.747,-Have you seen Frank or Brenda? -I think they went upstairs.
01:41:38.050,01:41:41.804,"Okay, in two days, you're gonna meet me at Miami International Airport."
01:41:41.971,01:41:44.473,All right? You're gonna leave the house after your parents go to sleep.
01:41:44.557,01:41:45.891,You're gonna take a taxicab.
01:41:46.267,01:41:49.687,You give the taxi driver this money right here and you tell him to drive all through the night.
01:41:51.939,01:41:53.190,10 a.m. All right?
01:42:13.085,01:42:15.087,"-Which room, sir? -In the corner."
01:42:17.089,01:42:18.549,The international terminal in Miami.
01:42:20.301,01:42:21.385,-No matter what. -No matter what.
01:42:21.510,01:42:23.299,-You're gonna take a taxicab. -I'm gonna take a taxi.
01:42:23.474,01:42:26.015,-You're gonna be there at 10 a.m. -I'll be there at 10 a.m. no matter what.
01:42:26.098,01:42:28.684,"In two days. Two days, Brenda. Two days."
01:42:28.809,01:42:31.354,"In two days, I'll be there, no matter what, at 10 a.m."
01:42:38.694,01:42:41.238,"We're not gonna tell anyone, Brenda. You have to promise me now."
01:42:41.572,01:42:44.742,"Please! Please, before you go, please tell me your name."
01:42:45.242,01:42:46.452,Please tell me.
01:42:48.245,01:42:51.791,"Frank William Abagnale, Jr."
01:45:21.565,01:45:22.900,"He's not here today, he'll be here tomorrow."
01:45:22.983,01:45:24.610,We'll get him before he leaves the country.
01:45:24.693,01:45:26.028,He doesn't have a passport.
01:45:26.445,01:45:28.697,"For the last six months, he's gone to Harvard and Berkeley."
01:45:28.781,01:45:30.533,I'm betting he can get a passport.
01:45:30.741,01:45:32.952,So we have all our men waiting for him here at Miami International.
01:45:33.035,01:45:34.620,"He's used it before, he knows the layout."
01:45:34.703,01:45:38.290,"I'll talk to Miami police, they offered us 50 uniformed cops in two shifts of 25."
01:45:38.374,01:45:40.626,"With our guys, that's almost 100 men in one airport."
01:45:40.793,01:45:42.211,Don't you think we should spread it around?
01:45:42.294,01:45:43.921,"No, no, this is the exit point."
01:45:44.129,01:45:47.925,"How do you know he hasn't rented a car and driven to airports in New York, Atlanta?"
01:45:48.008,01:45:50.928,Because I'm not in New York. I'm not in Atlanta.
01:45:53.806,01:45:59.770,And I'm letting all the universities in the area know that Pan Am will be initiating a new recruiting program this year.
01:46:00.229,01:46:03.148,I'll be stopping by your campus tomorrow morning.
01:46:06.652,01:46:16.161,"At the end of the day, I'll be choosing eight young ladies ...Pan Am's future stewardess flight crew program."
01:46:16.245,01:46:21.000,"Now, these eight young ladies will accompany me on a two-month public relations tour through Europe..."
01:46:22.293,01:46:26.839,...where they will discover firsthand what it takes to be a Pan American stewardess.
01:46:31.886,01:46:35.139,"No, one man per every two counters. All right?"
01:46:36.640,01:46:38.183,-Amdursky? -Yeah?
01:46:39.518,01:46:42.730,"Make sure your uniforms are covering the sidewalks, entrances, and exits."
01:46:43.606,01:46:44.565,Hey.
01:46:45.357,01:46:48.152,Let's have periodic sweeps of the men's lav.
01:46:49.945,01:46:52.781,What qualifies me to be a future stewardess?
01:46:53.282,01:47:01.040,"Well, I think that I'm really friendly and I can really help out and make people feel welcome on the plane and..."
01:47:01.206,01:47:05.377,"We'll be traveling at 6,000 miles per hour, at an altitude of 300 feet."
01:47:12.801,01:47:14.261,Ilene Anderson.
01:47:22.561,01:47:24.063,Miggy Acker.
01:47:37.743,01:47:38.827,Candy Heston.
01:48:38.595,01:48:41.348,-See that blonde out front? -I should have been a pilot.
01:48:41.640,01:48:42.599,Exactly.
01:48:45.644,01:48:46.520,Hanratty.
01:48:48.480,01:48:52.735,There's a guy in a Pan Am uniform sitting in a white Coupe de Ville out front of Terminal J.
01:48:52.943,01:48:56.071,That's the charter terminal. Did you get a look at his face?
01:48:56.155,01:48:58.532,"He's got his pilot's cap on. Carl, I think it's him."
01:49:11.503,01:49:12.838,"Out of the car, Frank."
01:49:13.714,01:49:14.673,Frank?
01:49:17.384,01:49:18.886,Keep your hands where I can see them.
01:49:19.344,01:49:21.180,Don't shoot me. I'm just a driver.
01:49:21.388,01:49:25.267,A man paid me a hundred dollars to wear this uniform -and pick someone up at the airport. -Who you picking up?
01:49:26.560,01:49:27.561,Hey!
01:49:55.631,01:49:57.591,The kid's gone completely out of control.
01:49:57.800,01:49:59.802,"-Why wasn't I called? -Nobody was called, sir."
01:49:59.885,01:50:01.720,The banks didn't know what was happening till last week.
01:50:01.887,01:50:02.888,That's impossible.
01:50:03.013,01:50:05.516,They didn't call 'cause it's not counterfeiting. It's something else.
01:50:05.599,01:50:07.965,"-Well, what is he doing? -He's making real checks, sir."
01:50:08.065,01:50:10.062,These are so perfect the airline didn't know the difference.
01:50:10.145,01:50:12.064,Last check was cashed in Madrid a week ago.
01:50:12.147,01:50:14.650,"My guess is he's still there. We have to leave now, sir. Today."
01:50:14.942,01:50:17.444,Go where? Spain. You want to go to Spain?
01:50:17.528,01:50:19.822,Eventually he's gotta go back to where the checks were printed.
01:50:19.905,01:50:22.324,"I think that's why he's moving back through Europe. Look at the map, sir."
01:50:22.449,01:50:24.660,He's making a circle. He's running out of checks. I know it's a...
01:50:24.910,01:50:32.334,"a long shot, sir, but if we could track him from Madrid, -sir, we could still catch him. -I'm sorry, Carl, if you couldn't catch him here, you're not gonna catch him there."
01:50:32.417,01:50:34.086,"Sir, we're gonna let him get away."
01:50:35.212,01:50:37.214,"No, Carl, you let him get away."
01:51:19.464,01:51:24.219,A perfect one-sixteenth all the way around.
01:51:25.179,01:51:28.932,Hm! Color separation is flawless.
01:51:31.685,01:51:35.522,-There's no bleeding. -Nobody does work like this in the States.
01:51:42.529,01:51:44.865,"-A Heidelberg, an Istra. -Heidelberg."
01:51:44.948,01:51:48.035,"A dinosaur, four colors, you can smell the weight."
01:51:48.452,01:51:50.037,"Two tons, without the ink."
01:51:51.121,01:51:52.706,Where do they do printing like this?
01:51:53.624,01:51:54.958,"Germany, Great Britain."
01:51:58.921,01:52:02.841,France. Frank's mother said the name of a village in France where they didn't have Sara Lee.
01:52:02.925,01:52:05.719,"-The village where she met Frank's father. -Oh, yeah, I don't remember..."
01:52:05.802,01:52:10.015,"It started with an M. It was Mont something, Mont. Mr. Fox?"
01:52:10.098,01:52:12.517,"Yes, question: You met your husband during the war?"
01:52:12.601,01:52:15.812,"Answer: I lived in a village in France, where they never heard of Sara Lee."
01:52:15.896,01:52:18.148,"Tell me you wrote down the name of the village, Mr. Fox."
01:52:20.692,01:52:21.777,Montrichard.
01:53:18.834,01:53:20.502,Carl? Carl!
01:53:22.671,01:53:24.172,Merry Christmas!
01:53:24.423,01:53:27.426,"How is it that we're always talking on Christmas, Carl?"
01:53:27.509,01:53:29.553,"Every Christmas, I'm talking to you!"
01:53:31.471,01:53:32.431,You're under arrest.
01:53:32.556,01:53:34.599,Hey! Are you hungry? Do you want some beans?
01:53:34.683,01:53:36.685,"Carl, they got the best French beans here."
01:53:36.768,01:53:39.730,There's two dozen French police officers outside.
01:53:39.855,01:53:47.988,"-Carl, they're delicious. -They wanted to bring you in, But I told them I wouldn't bring them to you, unless I could put the cuffs on you myself."
01:53:48.280,01:53:50.032,"Carl, do you have a gun? You have a gun?"
01:53:50.490,01:53:51.533,-No gun? -No.
01:53:51.658,01:53:52.659,No gun.
01:53:57.205,01:54:00.667,There's two dozen French police officers out there right now on Christmas Eve?
01:54:00.834,01:54:02.169,-That's what you're telling me? -Yeah.
01:54:06.465,01:54:08.925,-I'm gonna take a look out the front door. -No! No!
01:54:09.009,01:54:11.845,I told them I'd walk out first and... give a signal. Here.
01:54:12.012,01:54:13.764,"-You can put these on yourself. -No, I can't do that!"
01:54:17.351,01:54:18.852,Because I think you're full of shit.
01:54:24.649,01:54:26.568,"I think it's just me and you, and you know what?"
01:54:30.822,01:54:34.743,"Oh, that's good. That's good. Tell me what you want me to see, huh?"
01:54:35.827,01:54:38.789,-I wouldn't lie to you. -I'm looking at your wedding ring.
01:54:38.872,01:54:41.375,"You're wearing a wedding ring, Carl. You lied to me about that!"
01:54:44.252,01:54:45.921,I did. But I don't anymore.
01:54:54.971,01:54:58.934,"Yes. No, no, no, there is no problem. We're coming out right now."
01:55:02.687,01:55:06.358,"That was good. What, did you pay some hotel desk clerk to make that call for you? Is that what you did?"
01:55:06.566,01:55:08.485,It was Captain Luc. I've got one minute to bring you out.
01:55:08.610,01:55:18.412,"Captain Luc? Captain Luc? Oh, Captain Luc! Well, Carl, I gotta say, that sounds pretty official to me, but, like I said, I think it's just me and you here. Just me and you."
01:55:18.495,01:55:19.788,"So, you're gonna have to catch me."
01:55:19.871,01:55:22.833,Frank. Frank! You have to trust me on this.
01:55:22.916,01:55:25.877,"These people have been embarrassed, Frank. They're angry."
01:55:26.086,01:55:28.505,"You rob their banks, you steal their money, you live in their country."
01:55:28.588,01:55:30.841,I told you this was what was going to happen.
01:55:31.007,01:55:32.759,That there was no other way for it to end.
01:55:36.179,01:55:38.640,"That's good. That's good, Carl, you know?"
01:55:39.141,01:55:41.476,Keep pushing that lie. Keep pushing it.
01:55:41.852,01:55:44.396,-Keep pushing until you make it true. -They're gonna kill you!
01:55:45.689,01:55:47.524,"You walk out that door, they're gonna kill you."
01:55:53.280,01:55:54.573,Is that the truth?
01:55:59.077,01:56:00.036,Yeah.
01:56:05.876,01:56:07.461,"Do you have any children, Carl?"
01:56:09.129,01:56:10.464,I have a four-year-old daughter.
01:56:12.132,01:56:13.467,Do you swear on your daughter?
01:56:16.470,01:56:17.637,You swear?
01:56:23.393,01:56:24.394,You swear?
01:57:06.603,01:57:08.063,I have him in custody.
01:57:09.231,01:57:11.441,I got him. I got him! It's all right.
01:57:21.826,01:57:24.621,Frank Abagnale surrendered of his own accord. Understood?
01:57:26.790,01:57:28.959,Where you taking him? I'm supposed to go.
01:57:39.636,01:57:40.720,"Don't worry, Frank."
01:57:40.804,01:57:43.348,I'll have you extradited back to the United States. Don't worry!
01:58:04.661,01:58:05.579,Carl.
01:58:07.747,01:58:08.707,Carl.
01:58:09.374,01:58:12.210,You have to remember to let me call my father when we land.
01:58:13.295,01:58:17.173,I just wanna talk to him before he sees me on television or something like that.
01:58:28.268,01:58:31.563,"Carl, look. That's LaGuardia right there."
01:58:32.105,01:58:35.275,"-Runway 44. -Frank, your father is dead."
01:58:36.651,01:58:37.777,I'm sorry.
01:58:38.945,01:58:42.282,I didn't want to say anything until we got closer to home. He...
01:58:43.575,01:58:47.370,He fell down some steps at Grand Central Station trying to catch a train.
01:58:48.747,01:58:50.665,I didn't want to be the one to tell you.
01:58:51.916,01:58:53.001,"You're lying, right?"
01:58:55.337,01:58:56.963,You said I could talk to him.
01:58:57.922,01:59:00.383,"Carl, who are you to, who are you to say something like that, huh?"
01:59:00.508,01:59:02.010,Who are you to say something like that?
01:59:02.093,01:59:05.597,-You said I could talk to him. -He fell and he broke his neck. I'm sorry.
01:59:07.474,01:59:08.642,I'm really sorry.
01:59:59.359,02:00:00.485,Daddy.
02:00:04.906,02:00:06.991,-I've told you twice. We're landing. -Sorry. Thank you.
02:00:07.075,02:00:10.286,-All of you. -Frank! Come on now. Frank?
02:00:10.370,02:00:12.831,We're landing in six minutes. All of you need to be in your seats.
02:00:12.914,02:00:14.708,"-with seat belts fastened. -Frank, open the door."
02:00:15.291,02:00:16.501,Frank!
02:00:18.086,02:00:19.421,-You do it. -Yeah.
02:00:48.783,02:00:50.785,Frank! Frank!
02:01:10.125,02:01:13.057,you must stay seated until the aircraft has come to a complete stop.
02:02:04.234,02:02:05.610,What's your name?
02:02:10.281,02:02:11.533,Where's your mommy?
02:03:23.855,02:03:47.962,"your history of bold and elusive behavior, and your complete lack of respect for the laws of the United States, I have no choice but to ignore your request to be treated as a minor, and sentence you to 12 years in Atlanta's maximum-security prison, and recommend strongly that you be kept in isolation for the entirety of that sentence."
02:04:30.672,02:04:31.923,"Merry Christmas, Frank."
02:04:35.134,02:04:36.678,"Hey, I got you some comic books."
02:04:44.143,02:04:46.604,How's your daughter? What was her name?
02:04:47.021,02:04:49.565,Grace. Good.
02:04:49.816,02:04:52.986,I don't know. She lives with her mother in Chicago. I don't get to see her much.
02:04:55.071,02:04:57.281,-What's in the briefcase? -Oh.
02:04:58.241,02:04:59.659,I'm on my way to the airport.
02:05:05.039,02:05:09.043,"-Oh, Jesus. He's driving us crazy. -You got any of the checks?"
02:05:09.460,02:05:14.007,"Yeah, yeah, I got a counterfeit he drew on Great Lakes Savings and Loan."
02:05:14.841,02:05:16.968,"See, he's just using a stencil machine and an Underwood."
02:05:17.844,02:05:19.595,"Yeah, it's a teller at the bank."
02:05:20.263,02:05:23.016,"-Say again? -It's definitely a teller, Carl."
02:05:23.391,02:05:26.227,"I mean, banks, they always use hand stamps for the dates, see?"
02:05:26.644,02:05:29.522,"They get used over and over again, so they always get worn out."
02:05:29.689,02:05:32.817,The numbers are always cracking. The sixes and the nines.
02:05:37.572,02:05:38.531,Thanks.
02:05:51.878,02:05:53.087,Tell me what you think.
02:05:57.508,02:05:58.676,That's a fake.
02:05:59.093,02:06:00.511,How do you know? You haven't looked at it.
02:06:00.595,02:06:02.472,"There's no perforated edge, right?"
02:06:02.722,02:06:05.725,"I mean, this check was hand-cut, not fed."
02:06:07.101,02:06:11.606,"Yeah. Paper is double-bonded, much too heavy to be a bank check."
02:06:18.905,02:06:21.407,And this doesn't smell like MICR. It's some kind of...
02:06:21.491,02:06:23.367,"You know, some kind of a drafting ink."
02:06:23.451,02:06:25.453,"You know, the kind you get at a stationery store."
02:06:31.501,02:06:36.714,"Frank, would you be interested in working with the FBI's Financial Crimes Unit?"
02:06:38.966,02:06:41.719,"I already got a job here, you know, I deliver the mail."
02:06:44.347,02:06:47.183,"Frank, we have the power to take you out of prison."
02:06:49.018,02:06:54.273,You'll be placed in the custody of the FBI where you'd serve out the remainder of your sentence as an employee of the Federal Government.
02:06:57.318,02:06:58.694,Under whose custody?
02:07:07.870,02:07:12.250,Hi. I'm Frank Abagnale. I'm supposed to start work here today.
02:07:12.959,02:07:15.253,It's a tour company operating out of the BVI.
02:07:16.295,02:07:19.298,"-Sir, Mr. Abagnale is here. -I'm gonna call you back."
02:07:50.329,02:07:52.748,"-Hello, Carl. -Welcome to the FBI."
02:07:53.457,02:07:54.834,I'll show you where you're working.
02:08:07.263,02:08:09.724,It's 8:15 in the morning till five in the afternoon.
02:08:10.308,02:08:12.268,-Forty-five minutes for lunch. -No.
02:08:13.769,02:08:15.104,"No. I mean, how long?"
02:08:17.356,02:08:18.441,Every day.
02:08:19.150,02:08:21.027,"Every day, Frank, till we let you go."
02:09:14.914,02:09:16.332,"-Yeah? -Hey, Carl."
02:09:19.543,02:09:20.544,How you doing?
02:09:20.628,02:09:23.673,"It's not a good time, Frank. I'm clearing my desk for the weekend."
02:09:27.343,02:09:29.595,"Carl, you mind if I come to work with you tomorrow?"
02:09:30.263,02:09:31.806,Tomorrow is Saturday.
02:09:32.223,02:09:35.726,I'm flying to Chicago to see my daughter. I'll be back to work on Monday.
02:09:35.810,02:09:38.479,"-You're gonna see Grace, huh? -Well, that's the plan."
02:09:44.860,02:09:47.196,"I'm sorry, kid, I can't help you there. Excuse me."
02:09:54.662,02:09:56.038,This is Hanratty.
02:09:56.956,02:09:58.291,"Yeah, put him on."
02:10:06.841,02:10:09.719,Mr. Sawyer. How are you?
02:10:10.594,02:10:14.473,I have half a dozen more checks on that tour operator at the BVI.
02:10:52.970,02:10:54.972,is now open for passenger check-in.
02:10:55.056,02:10:56.474,"How'd you do it, Frank?"
02:10:58.642,02:11:00.603,How did you pass the bar in Louisiana?
02:11:04.106,02:11:05.066,Listen.
02:11:06.359,02:11:08.152,I'm sorry I put you through all this.
02:11:08.235,02:11:10.738,"You go back to Europe, you're gonna die in Perpignan prison."
02:11:10.905,02:11:14.325,"Try to run here in the States, we'll send you back to Atlanta for 50 years."
02:11:15.368,02:11:16.494,I know that.
02:11:18.788,02:11:20.915,I spent four years trying to arrange your release.
02:11:21.248,02:11:25.544,I had to convince my bosses at the FBI and the Attorney General of the United States you wouldn't run.
02:11:26.504,02:11:27.838,Why'd you do it?
02:11:29.006,02:11:31.509,-You're just a kid. -I'm not your kid.
02:11:32.176,02:11:33.928,You said you were going to Chicago.
02:11:34.595,02:11:37.556,My daughter can't see me this weekend. She's going skiing.
02:11:39.100,02:11:41.018,You said she was four years old. You're lying.
02:11:41.227,02:11:44.063,She was four when I left. Now she's 15.
02:11:44.814,02:11:47.024,My wife's been remarried for 11 years.
02:11:47.566,02:11:49.402,I see Grace every now and again.
02:11:50.653,02:11:53.155,-I don't understand. -Sure you do.
02:11:54.031,02:11:55.908,Sometimes it's easier living the lie.
02:12:00.037,02:12:01.872,"I'm gonna let you fly tonight, Frank."
02:12:03.124,02:12:04.583,Not even gonna try to stop you.
02:12:04.750,02:12:06.627,Because I know you'll be back on Monday.
02:12:07.461,02:12:10.673,Yeah. How do you know I'll come back?
02:12:13.926,02:12:15.052,Look.
02:12:16.095,02:12:17.138,Frank.
02:12:17.638,02:12:19.056,Nobody is chasing you.
02:12:23.519,02:12:25.479,to Pittsburgh now ready for boarding.
02:12:25.980,02:12:30.025,Passengers with boarding passes please proceed to gate 23A.
02:12:38.492,02:12:42.246,"-Okay. -Alice, has he still not called?"
02:12:42.580,02:12:43.956,"No, he hasn't."
02:12:56.135,02:13:05.561,"Good morning. I've called this meeting to discuss a new type of check fraud and counterfeiting in which the unsub is washing and altering checks, then passing them throughout Arizona."
02:13:10.024,02:13:18.824,"This unsub is a big dog, Sorry I'm late."
02:13:20.534,02:13:21.535,Sorry.
02:13:26.207,02:13:29.001,We have a recovered check on Agent Reiter's desk.
02:13:29.084,02:13:30.753,Why don't we step out to the bullpen?
02:13:36.175,02:13:38.177,There's impressions on every line.
02:13:40.221,02:13:43.265,Looks like the original amount was for 60 dollars.
02:13:51.857,02:13:53.817,Cashed in Flagstaff a week ago.
02:13:56.987,02:13:59.114,"Cost the bank 16,000 dollars."
02:14:03.494,02:14:06.288,It's been washed. The only thing original is the signature.
02:14:09.333,02:14:11.293,"I mean, this isn't hydrochloride or bleach."
02:14:12.211,02:14:14.296,No. Something new.
02:14:15.256,02:14:19.093,Maybe a nail polish remover where the acetone removes the ink that's not been printed?
02:14:23.472,02:14:24.890,"How did you do it, Frank?"
02:14:26.600,02:14:29.019,How did you cheat on the bar exam in Louisiana?
02:14:34.858,02:14:36.026,I didn't cheat.
02:14:38.153,02:14:40.322,I studied for two weeks and I passed.
02:14:42.992,02:14:46.537,"Is that the truth, Frank? Is that the truth?"
02:14:46.662,02:14:49.456,I'll bet this guy steals checks out of mailboxes.
02:14:49.957,02:14:52.293,He washes off their names and puts on his own.
02:14:54.587,02:14:55.963,You're saying that he's a local?
02:14:56.797,02:15:00.676,"Well, if it were me, you know, I'd call the bank first, I'd check out the balance..."
02:15:00.759,02:15:03.095,Make sure there's enough money to make it worth your while.
02:15:03.178,02:15:04.179,Exactly.
02:15:07.349,02:15:10.102,Huh! Guess all we have to do now is catch him.
