00:02:17.541,00:02:18.541,Go fight!
00:02:26.916,00:02:28.750,Don't throw another fucking grenade!
00:02:28.750,00:02:29.791,We're back here too!
00:02:29.791,00:02:31.208,Don't throw another one!
00:02:36.000,00:02:37.000,Shut up!
00:02:37.625,00:02:40.041,Don't be afraid. All is good.
00:02:40.041,00:02:43.083,The Boy! Worry about the Boy!
00:03:27.458,00:03:29.208,Ammo? Ammo?
00:03:29.541,00:03:31.416,No! Look for something sharp that could kill!
00:03:31.500,00:03:34.625,They're out of ammo! They're out of ammo!
00:04:06.000,00:04:07.000,Uncle?
00:04:07.250,00:04:08.250,Uncle?
00:04:09.125,00:04:10.125,Uncle?
00:04:19.958,00:04:20.958,Clear?
00:04:23.041,00:04:24.083,Clear?
00:04:27.541,00:04:28.541,Clear!
00:04:30.625,00:04:32.166,Secure the area.
00:04:32.166,00:04:33.208,Be careful.
00:04:35.750,00:04:36.750,SWAT.
00:04:43.750,00:04:45.375,Two Policemen inside.
00:04:54.916,00:04:56.500,God I hate guns.
00:05:04.625,00:05:06.375,You two okay?
00:05:09.333,00:05:12.541,What are uniformed Policemen doing on this side of the City?
00:05:12.916,00:05:14.750,"Arresting these two, Sir."
00:05:16.708,00:05:19.000,We're arresting people again?
00:05:19.000,00:05:20.083,"Yes, Sir."
00:05:20.083,00:05:21.416,Progress.
00:05:21.875,00:05:23.458,Daesh is starting to break. Run.
00:05:24.125,00:05:25.500,Did they know that?
00:05:30.625,00:05:32.291,Arresting them for what?
00:05:32.291,00:05:33.333,"Drugs, Sir."
00:05:33.333,00:05:36.416,"Crossing over to our side, trading drugs for weapons, ammo."
00:05:36.416,00:05:39.583,With friends like ours who needs enemies?
00:05:40.041,00:05:41.541,How long have you been a Policeman?
00:05:41.958,00:05:43.291,"Two months, Sir."
00:05:44.875,00:05:45.916,You can fight.
00:05:47.250,00:05:48.541,You're the SWAT Team?
00:05:49.000,00:05:50.291,SWAT?
00:05:50.708,00:05:51.458,Yeah.
00:05:51.458,00:05:52.833,We thought you were all dead.
00:05:53.041,00:05:54.458,They're dead...
00:05:55.791,00:05:58.166,I think they did too.
00:06:25.541,00:06:26.541,Still good?
00:06:26.541,00:06:27.791,All good.
00:06:28.833,00:06:29.833,The List.
00:06:31.833,00:06:32.916,Hurry.
00:06:36.458,00:06:38.125,"We thought you were all dead, Sir."
00:06:39.458,00:06:41.666,Didn't you already say that?
00:06:44.125,00:06:46.750,Only half the Unit died.
00:06:48.625,00:06:53.500,The half who remembered you should question suspects before stabbing them?
00:06:53.500,00:06:56.291,We've heard all their answers.
00:06:56.291,00:06:58.708,Then at least put bullets in their heads.
00:06:58.708,00:07:00.375,Bomb! Bomb!
00:07:00.375,00:07:02.166,White KIA turning left. Move! Move!
00:07:20.041,00:07:21.041,Clear?
00:07:25.666,00:07:26.666,Clear?
00:07:26.666,00:07:28.208,Clear!
00:07:28.208,00:07:30.375,Get up...
00:07:30.375,00:07:31.833,Move. Move.
00:07:44.458,00:07:45.458,What's your full name?
00:07:48.625,00:07:49.666,"Why, Sir?"
00:07:49.666,00:07:52.333,"If you're on the list, you're the enemy."
00:07:52.333,00:07:53.708,"Sir, he has a common name."
00:07:54.958,00:07:56.291,There are ages next to the names.
00:07:56.291,00:07:57.333,"How old is the list, Sir?"
00:07:57.333,00:07:58.291,I don't know.
00:07:58.291,00:07:59.291,Where did you get it?
00:07:59.291,00:08:00.291,We've always had it.
00:08:00.375,00:08:02.208,We're Policemen. Like all of you.
00:08:02.208,00:08:03.541,Police?
00:08:03.541,00:08:08.500,He was police. And him. And him. And him.
00:08:08.666,00:08:13.125,And him. And- I am Jameel Al Qurtubi.
00:08:14.958,00:08:16.041,Qurtubi.
00:08:17.500,00:08:20.416,Jameel Ziad Al Qurtubi.
00:08:22.875,00:08:26.000,"Don't be afraid, you're not the enemy."
00:08:26.541,00:08:29.250,Sir- Kawa Salah al-Faily.
00:08:30.916,00:08:31.916,Your ID?
00:08:32.416,00:08:36.833,I haven't been a Policeman long enough to receive an ID.
00:08:42.875,00:08:43.875,How old are you?
00:08:43.875,00:08:45.375,"21, Sir."
00:09:01.666,00:09:03.750,Have either of you been wounded?
00:09:04.458,00:09:05.458,No.
00:09:06.833,00:09:10.291,"I mean not just today, but ever? Wounded by Daesh?"
00:09:10.750,00:09:12.708,You're the last two then.
00:09:13.500,00:09:16.208,Have either of you lost family to Daesh?
00:09:16.208,00:09:19.500,"No, some were killed by the Americans, some left with them."
00:09:20.708,00:09:22.125,He was my Uncle.
00:09:23.083,00:09:24.875,Did you love him?
00:09:24.875,00:09:26.875,Of course I did.
00:09:29.666,00:09:31.083,Why aren't you crying?
00:09:33.458,00:09:34.833,I don't know.
00:09:37.250,00:09:38.875,Are you married?
00:09:38.875,00:09:41.750,"Sir, I wouldn't be here if I was."
00:09:42.916,00:09:43.916,What?
00:09:46.208,00:09:47.416,What do you mean?
00:09:47.416,00:09:49.750,"Calm down, calm down."
00:09:51.458,00:09:53.583,He's still a kid.
00:09:53.583,00:09:54.875,Let him be.
00:09:58.000,00:09:59.291,What did I say?
00:09:59.375,00:10:00.375,Kamal.
00:10:13.541,00:10:14.541,Him too?
00:10:15.291,00:10:16.000,No.
00:10:16.000,00:10:17.000,Why?
00:10:17.750,00:10:20.958,He hasn't been wounded by Daesh or lost family to them.
00:10:20.958,00:10:22.791,And all of you have?
00:10:23.458,00:10:24.541,Most both.
00:10:26.541,00:10:28.500,I don't really know who you are.
00:10:29.000,00:10:32.583,We're the Men who killed the Men who killed your Uncle.
00:10:32.583,00:10:35.958,"If you need to know more than that, you shouldn't take the hat."
00:10:37.458,00:10:38.958,I don't want to leave his body here.
00:10:38.958,00:10:41.041,We won't leave him here.
00:10:47.375,00:10:48.375,Let's go.
00:10:48.750,00:10:51.291,We're taking Kurdish kids now?
00:10:51.541,00:10:53.166,What's wrong with Kurds?
00:10:58.000,00:10:59.166,I'll get your Uncle.
00:11:13.041,00:11:14.208,Let's go guys. Fast.
00:11:17.250,00:11:18.250,Take this off?
00:11:19.083,00:11:20.208,You a medium?
00:11:21.875,00:11:22.875,Medium.
00:11:22.875,00:11:25.458,What do you think? We got a store?
00:11:48.916,00:11:50.583,Here's a belt.
00:11:50.583,00:11:52.625,Are you left or right handed?
00:11:53.041,00:11:54.041,Left.
00:11:56.625,00:11:58.333,Get back to the other side.
00:11:58.333,00:12:01.083,Those weren't the only guys we were trying to catch over here.
00:12:01.083,00:12:02.625,Get back to the other side.
00:12:02.625,00:12:05.958,Arresting people here and now is useless.
00:12:05.958,00:12:08.583,Every jail in Iraq is a broken urn.
00:12:08.583,00:12:10.666,Tell your superiors he's with us.
00:12:11.000,00:12:13.500,My superiors think you're dead.
00:12:13.500,00:12:17.750,Then they'll be anxious to hear what you have to say. Go.
00:12:17.750,00:12:18.750,Move.
00:12:25.166,00:12:26.708,Here's your weapon.
00:12:27.083,00:12:28.083,Kawa...
00:12:34.291,00:12:35.833,Are you sure?
00:12:50.625,00:12:52.291,Don't waste it.
00:12:52.291,00:12:54.875,I'm going to wash his Uncle's blood off his hands.
00:13:07.916,00:13:10.041,"Waleed, Kamal...keep him between you."
00:13:14.375,00:13:16.583,Watch us and you'll learn quick.
00:13:24.458,00:13:26.041,Sorry about what I said.
00:13:28.458,00:13:30.750,Where did you guys just come from?
00:13:30.750,00:13:32.916,Did you go to the Gifted Students School?
00:13:32.916,00:13:33.916,Yeah.
00:13:35.291,00:13:37.791,I was a few years ahead of you. You look familiar.
00:13:39.583,00:13:43.833,"We were on mission, heard your service pistols, assumed it was police in trouble."
00:13:43.833,00:13:45.083,Thank you.
00:13:45.208,00:13:50.083,Thank Major Jasem. If it had been up to me we would have stayed on mission.
00:13:50.083,00:13:52.166,What is your mission?
00:14:01.416,00:14:03.208,It's OUR mission now.
00:14:03.208,00:14:05.791,And if you fuck it up I'll kill you.
00:14:48.375,00:14:52.125,Wait here and provide cover first.
00:14:55.916,00:14:56.916,Thank you.
00:14:57.208,00:14:58.083,What?
00:14:58.083,00:15:00.208,Thank you. You saved my life.
00:15:05.541,00:15:07.083,How long since your Dad died?
00:15:07.666,00:15:09.708,How do you know my Dad is dead?
00:15:11.083,00:15:12.833,I can tell you were raised well.
00:15:12.833,00:15:14.541,Raised by a mother.
00:15:14.541,00:15:16.458,Lift your weapon up and keep your eyes open.
00:15:18.083,00:15:19.208,And don't thank me.
00:15:19.708,00:15:21.333,We need the numbers.
00:15:27.500,00:15:28.541,I smell a body...
00:15:32.000,00:15:33.000,It's right here.
00:15:35.375,00:15:36.708,Clear!
00:15:38.833,00:15:40.416,Let's take 10 minutes here to rest.
00:15:59.083,00:16:01.708,Check if there is electricity...
00:16:08.833,00:16:09.875,"Shut up, Dick."
00:16:10.375,00:16:11.416,You wanna go?
00:16:13.291,00:16:17.916,Let's secure the 2nd floor. The smell down here is killing me.
00:16:17.916,00:16:19.041,Let's go guys.
00:16:21.916,00:16:23.750,Just 10 minutes. I promise.
00:16:23.750,00:16:25.291,You should eat something.
00:16:26.000,00:16:27.000,Okay?
00:16:27.208,00:16:29.541,And the 3rd Humvee won't be back for a bit anyway.
00:16:30.791,00:16:31.958,"As ordered, Sir."
00:16:44.791,00:16:45.791,Kawa?
00:16:53.375,00:16:54.375,Clear!
00:16:55.041,00:16:58.125,"We call this a Stack. Two clear the room, two provide cover."
00:16:58.125,00:16:59.541,"When ready, we touch the shoulder."
00:16:59.541,00:17:02.041,Never stand in front of a door. You'll get killed.
00:17:05.083,00:17:06.083,Clear!
00:17:09.708,00:17:10.625,Clear!
00:17:11.833,00:17:12.958,Found one!
00:17:23.041,00:17:24.333,The Kuwaiti soap opera?
00:18:16.041,00:18:17.541,Why's she starting a fight?
00:18:18.166,00:18:20.208,Because she's pregnant and the other one isn't.
00:18:20.750,00:18:22.291,Who's the woman in between them?
00:18:22.666,00:18:26.750,"I think the third wife - no, no, no - I mean the first wife."
00:18:27.041,00:18:28.125,First or third?
00:18:28.416,00:18:30.375,"The first, the first, the one with the Mercedes."
00:18:30.375,00:18:31.416,Let us watch!
00:18:31.416,00:18:33.250,Let me answer his question!
00:18:34.375,00:18:35.666,How many does he need?
00:18:36.208,00:18:38.416,"Kuwaitis, Bro."
00:18:41.833,00:18:44.000,"Kawa, sit."
00:18:44.541,00:18:48.833,"Whenever we have a chance to relax, take advantage."
00:19:11.375,00:19:12.458,Give it a second.
00:19:17.166,00:19:19.875,The third wife is really beautiful.
00:19:20.625,00:19:23.666,"One is enough trouble, let alone three."
00:19:39.208,00:19:41.250,Hand me any trash...
00:19:54.958,00:19:56.125,"Kamal, hand me the money."
00:20:06.125,00:20:07.875,What's the mission?
00:20:07.875,00:20:09.666,You don't need to know.
00:20:10.875,00:20:12.250,You don't trust me?
00:20:12.750,00:20:13.541,Hell no.
00:20:22.208,00:20:25.791,Get some rest. And you have to eat.
00:20:36.166,00:20:37.166,What's this?
00:20:37.250,00:20:38.125,Money.
00:20:38.333,00:20:39.333,Why?
00:21:04.166,00:21:05.291,Which would you go for?
00:21:05.291,00:21:06.291,Any is good.
00:21:49.458,00:21:50.666,Move.
00:21:53.416,00:21:54.791,That's my partner!
00:21:54.791,00:21:56.375,I told you to move away from here.
00:22:03.500,00:22:05.166,Your partner is a son of a bitch traitor.
00:22:05.750,00:22:06.791,How do you know?
00:22:26.291,00:22:27.958,Let them all get out first?
00:22:30.166,00:22:31.083,Get down!
00:22:51.750,00:22:52.750,Everyone okay?
00:22:54.333,00:22:55.333,Everyone okay?
00:23:09.833,00:23:11.875,I didn't do anything! I didn't do anything!
00:23:12.833,00:23:14.750,What did I do? What did I do?
00:23:16.166,00:23:17.333,Get the fuck off me!
00:23:20.583,00:23:21.958,Get off me!
00:23:21.958,00:23:23.041,The kid didn't do anything.
00:23:23.041,00:23:24.125,I said get off me!
00:23:52.166,00:23:53.500,Take these.
00:23:54.291,00:23:57.166,These should go to one of his friends.
00:24:05.500,00:24:07.083,I'm not a traitor.
00:24:09.125,00:24:10.875,I'm not a traitor.
00:24:23.625,00:24:25.250,Pick up your brother.
00:24:25.250,00:24:26.250,Move.
00:24:32.833,00:24:34.000,Careful of his head.
00:24:45.458,00:24:46.500,Careful with his leg.
00:24:58.791,00:25:00.125,Amen.
00:25:00.458,00:25:01.458,God rest his soul.
00:25:15.916,00:25:18.291,Where's- -he's dead.
00:25:18.291,00:25:19.750,He's new.
00:25:21.750,00:25:22.750,Huddle around.
00:25:29.166,00:25:33.291,"Sir, the shortest route is to stay here on the shit side of the City..."
00:25:33.291,00:25:37.250,"...head north, get attacked 50 times before we make it a mile."
00:25:37.250,00:25:42.125,Or we can try to bribe our way to the safe side of the City through this checkpoint here.
00:25:42.333,00:25:44.083,Both sound lovely.
00:25:45.291,00:25:46.750,But let's do the checkpoint.
00:25:46.750,00:25:48.250,It's safer.
00:25:48.500,00:25:49.583,But not for you.
00:25:49.875,00:25:53.416,Yes for me too: court martial is still preferable to death.
00:25:54.208,00:25:55.250,I think.
00:25:55.375,00:25:57.875,Move. I'm the lead vehicle.
00:25:58.875,00:26:01.208,"Kawa, you're with us."
00:26:01.208,00:26:02.208,Bribe who?
00:26:26.208,00:26:28.041,"Razak, quicker."
00:26:28.041,00:26:30.000,A bit quicker.
00:26:33.916,00:26:39.833,"Hey infidels, the soldiers of the Islamic State are still everywhere."
00:26:39.833,00:26:43.333,We will remain and expand.
00:26:43.333,00:26:46.875,We will cut your heads off.
00:26:46.875,00:26:49.458,Your supporters are the Agents of the Cross.
00:26:49.458,00:26:52.375,Your women will be ours.
00:26:52.375,00:26:55.875,"And your children, cubs of the caliphate. God willing."
00:26:56.458,00:27:00.500,Fuck you and your so called state. Son of a bitch.
00:27:01.000,00:27:02.541,We're the ones coming for you.
00:27:18.458,00:27:20.416,Let's pick up these children.
00:27:20.416,00:27:22.375,Stop the car. Stop the car.
00:27:28.375,00:27:29.583,Come with us.
00:27:29.583,00:27:31.250,We're crossing over.
00:27:34.750,00:27:36.583,"Come on dears, come with us."
00:27:36.583,00:27:37.708,Come with us.
00:27:38.291,00:27:40.875,We're not strangers. Come with us.
00:27:41.208,00:27:44.125,We can't leave. I promised my Dad.
00:27:44.125,00:27:45.166,Where is he?
00:27:51.916,00:27:55.333,Don't worry. We can rebuild everything.
00:27:55.333,00:27:58.541,We just have to kill them all first.
00:27:58.541,00:28:00.750,No. I promised.
00:28:01.125,00:28:01.958,Should we?
00:28:01.958,00:28:03.666,You promised Dad too!
00:28:03.666,00:28:05.333,Mom was bleeding.
00:28:05.333,00:28:07.708,So you just lie to them? They didn't teach you better?
00:28:07.708,00:28:10.708,They taught me to look out for my brother! What'd they teach you?
00:28:10.708,00:28:11.916,They taught me to keep my word.
00:28:11.916,00:28:14.666,Who will bury them if we don't?
00:28:14.666,00:28:16.916,We can help you dig. Just come with us.
00:28:16.916,00:28:18.916,"Sir please, we don't have time."
00:28:18.916,00:28:20.375,They're children. Wait!
00:28:20.375,00:28:23.500,"Sir, can't we just grab these little guys?"
00:28:23.500,00:28:25.208,This is not a place to stop and talk.
00:28:25.333,00:28:27.041,I'm going with them!
00:28:28.000,00:28:29.500,I'm sorry I yelled at you.
00:28:30.333,00:28:33.583,"If you go, we'll each be alone."
00:28:34.250,00:28:37.333,Come with me. Come with me. Come with me.
00:28:37.583,00:28:38.916,Calm down Waleed.
00:28:38.916,00:28:41.250,"Sir, please, we don't have time."
00:28:41.250,00:28:42.541,Give me a second!
00:28:42.541,00:28:43.583,Come on dear.
00:28:54.416,00:28:55.416,You coming or not?
00:29:01.833,00:29:03.166,I promised my Dad.
00:30:43.958,00:30:45.833,We are the Federal Police.
00:30:45.833,00:30:47.083,I know.
00:30:47.083,00:30:51.125,"You never saw us, or the two vehicles right behind. Got it?"
00:31:19.750,00:31:22.166,"Guys, take care of his body."
00:31:51.000,00:31:54.833,Why are we bribing Federal Police to cross back to our side of the City?
00:31:54.833,00:31:59.375,None of us knows anything about you pretty boy. Except that your partner was a fucking traitor.
00:31:59.375,00:32:03.250,You keep asking questions- -like why are we bribing our own?
00:32:03.250,00:32:04.500,"Yeah, and it won't end well."
00:32:04.500,00:32:06.708,Shut up. Pray.
00:32:18.416,00:32:19.791,Peace be upon you.
00:32:19.791,00:32:20.833,And upon you.
00:32:22.541,00:32:24.750,I see you are a family man.
00:32:24.750,00:32:26.458,I have a small request.
00:32:26.458,00:32:28.666,I found this kid on the other side.
00:32:28.666,00:32:30.791,I'd like for you to take care of him.
00:32:30.791,00:32:32.416,He lost his mom...
00:32:42.208,00:32:43.208,I can't.
00:32:44.000,00:32:44.833,Sorry.
00:32:44.833,00:32:47.583,"He needs a family, you have a family. Please keep him."
00:32:48.250,00:32:50.458,Of course we will keep him with us.
00:32:50.458,00:32:52.250,God bless you sister.
00:32:53.750,00:32:55.291,Grow up to be good.
00:32:57.291,00:33:03.833,"If you leave him with the Red Crescent, I'll know."
00:33:11.458,00:33:12.791,"My love, are you hurt?"
00:33:13.708,00:33:14.708,Does it hurt you?
00:33:16.041,00:33:17.416,"Come here, come."
00:33:33.958,00:33:34.958,SWAT?
00:33:35.208,00:33:37.000,You're still alive?!
00:33:37.625,00:33:39.750,Command has been looking all over for you!
00:33:40.500,00:33:41.625,Are you okay?
00:33:41.625,00:33:42.666,Don't worry about him.
00:33:43.083,00:33:43.708,Keep moving.
00:33:43.708,00:33:44.541,Don't touch me!
00:33:44.541,00:33:45.333,Keep moving!
00:33:45.333,00:33:46.041,Don't touch me!
00:33:46.875,00:33:48.375,Do you guys hear me?
00:33:50.541,00:33:52.541,Hey! What's wrong with you?
00:33:55.500,00:33:57.458,You've heard the stories about us?
00:33:58.583,00:33:59.416,Yes.
00:33:59.416,00:34:00.750,They're all true.
00:34:02.291,00:34:04.541,If you tell anybody you saw us...
00:34:05.833,00:34:07.416,...I'll know it was you.
00:34:08.916,00:34:09.916,Got it?
00:34:15.458,00:34:16.583,"Let's move, boys."
00:34:36.416,00:34:37.833,Hey SWAT?
00:34:37.833,00:34:42.250,We see you driving round the City. What are you looking for?
00:34:45.000,00:34:49.958,"You used to have 6 Humvees, now it's 3."
00:34:49.958,00:34:53.250,Couple months ago you had 9.
00:34:53.250,00:34:56.541,You are the infidels and the apostates.
00:34:56.541,00:35:00.750,You have lovely homes with comfortable beds. Thanks for leaving them to us.
00:35:05.083,00:35:07.541,We are not picking up ammo?
00:35:07.541,00:35:08.541,Or food?
00:35:10.291,00:35:11.291,Why not?
00:35:12.458,00:35:14.958,Why when I ask a question no one answers?
00:35:17.250,00:35:19.625,What are you running from? Really. What are you running from?
00:35:19.625,00:35:20.791,WE.
00:35:20.791,00:35:23.000,What are WE running from.
00:35:26.083,00:35:27.083,Where's the borek?
00:35:27.541,00:35:28.541,I ate it.
00:35:30.041,00:35:31.041,You finished it?
00:35:31.041,00:35:31.958,Yeah.
00:35:32.250,00:35:34.458,You should have shared with Razak or Waleed.
00:35:34.583,00:35:35.583,I got hungry.
00:35:35.750,00:35:36.958,You'll eat me next.
00:36:00.291,00:36:03.208,I used to be a Homicide Detective.
00:36:04.541,00:36:05.833,I know.
00:36:06.958,00:36:09.458,I was studying to be a detective.
00:36:10.166,00:36:12.458,You taught my evidence class.
00:36:13.625,00:36:16.583,You were in one of my evidence classes?
00:36:16.583,00:36:19.250,I knew I made a big impression.
00:36:20.833,00:36:22.041,Sorry.
00:36:25.875,00:36:28.041,Feels like many lifetimes ago.
00:36:29.541,00:36:31.208,I used to love my work.
00:36:31.208,00:36:34.166,Teaching?
00:36:34.666,00:36:36.541,Being a Detective.
00:36:38.666,00:36:43.666,I was really good at it. Probably why I loved it so much.
00:36:45.208,00:36:48.000,I liked who I was.
00:36:51.708,00:36:53.375,"You can go back to it, Sir."
00:36:56.541,00:36:58.916,I can never go back to it.
00:37:16.958,00:37:19.166,We're the good guys.
00:37:19.666,00:37:20.875,What?
00:37:21.916,00:37:23.250,We're the good guys.
00:37:23.875,00:37:29.416,"Listen carefully, the checkpoint was the last time you put a hand on me."
00:37:31.958,00:37:35.375,"If you stopped asking questions, I wouldn't have shoved you."
00:37:35.375,00:37:39.750,I'm not a donkey to be pushed around or yelled at.
00:37:40.375,00:37:41.583,Explain things to me.
00:37:41.583,00:37:43.958,I don't know where we're going. I don't know what our mission is.
00:37:43.958,00:37:45.666,I don't know you. I don't know any of you.
00:37:45.666,00:37:47.250,Why would I listen to you?
00:37:49.750,00:37:50.750,Understand?
00:37:51.458,00:37:52.458,Give me that.
00:37:55.666,00:37:57.125,His brother.
00:37:58.458,00:38:01.416,He'd force himself to watch this video.
00:38:01.416,00:38:04.958,Whenever he had second thoughts about what we were doing.
00:38:04.958,00:38:08.125,"Who we were fighting, and why."
00:38:10.625,00:38:14.916,All the pictures he took were proof that he did his part.
00:38:14.916,00:38:16.750,Pictures he could show his family.
00:38:17.333,00:38:20.125,Most of them are cops or soldiers.
00:38:31.333,00:38:34.291,So that's what you're doing? You're taking vengeance?
00:38:41.500,00:38:45.041,100 to 150 civilians headed this way...
00:38:45.041,00:38:46.791,Windows up.
00:39:03.500,00:39:05.625,We're about to cross back into the shit.
00:39:06.625,00:39:07.666,Keep your eyes open guys.
00:39:35.625,00:39:36.625,Watch it.
00:39:55.750,00:39:56.791,Stop! Stop!
00:39:56.791,00:39:58.166,They're shooting civilians!
00:40:00.333,00:40:01.666,Why are they shooting them?
00:40:01.666,00:40:03.958,Punishing them for leaving.
00:40:03.958,00:40:06.291,They want to keep them as human shields.
00:40:07.458,00:40:08.750,Where are they shooting from?
00:40:09.583,00:40:11.708,People are falling before we hear the shots!
00:40:14.625,00:40:15.708,I can't see Sir.
00:40:15.708,00:40:16.875,To the left! To the left!
00:40:22.791,00:40:25.541,Take cover behind the vehicles!
00:40:33.916,00:40:35.791,One o'clock! One o'clock!
00:40:38.083,00:40:40.041,Go back! Go back! You're in a minefield!
00:40:46.166,00:40:47.208,"Akram, Youness."
00:40:47.375,00:40:51.166,Stay here and protect the people. Shoot at the rooftop to the right!
00:40:51.166,00:40:53.083,Don't stop until I tell you to.
00:40:53.083,00:40:54.458,Razak move!
00:41:03.833,00:41:05.083,Fuck this!
00:41:05.083,00:41:06.291,Thaer my Son!
00:41:06.875,00:41:07.875,Fuck our luck!
00:41:08.875,00:41:09.875,Fuck our luck!
00:41:17.333,00:41:19.000,Wait until they reload.
00:41:20.375,00:41:22.208,Stop! Stop!
00:41:22.625,00:41:24.291,"Razak, stay here and wait for the others."
00:41:24.291,00:41:25.875,"Waleed, Kawa let's go."
00:41:42.416,00:41:43.416,Now?
00:41:52.291,00:41:53.291,Clear.
00:41:54.333,00:41:55.833,Clear.
00:41:59.625,00:42:00.666,All clear guys.
00:42:01.000,00:42:02.000,Move down the street.
00:42:02.000,00:42:04.041,"Stay on the side road, not the main one."
00:42:04.041,00:42:05.625,Razak is waiting. Move.
00:42:06.125,00:42:07.333,Son of a bitch.
00:42:07.333,00:42:09.500,Fuck you and everything you stood for.
00:42:23.958,00:42:27.083,Be careful Waleed.
00:42:30.208,00:42:32.083,Stay away from the wall.
00:42:32.083,00:42:33.541,This one's better.
00:42:49.791,00:42:51.333,Do you see it from here?
00:42:52.458,00:42:53.791,"Not yet, Sir."
00:43:15.791,00:43:17.250,To the left. To the left.
00:43:17.250,00:43:18.083,Where?
00:43:18.083,00:43:20.583,Blue satellite. About 2 kilometers...
00:43:26.375,00:43:27.500,We're really close.
00:43:36.791,00:43:41.500,"Drive the Humvees to the closest point, then continue on foot."
00:43:48.708,00:43:52.708,"We need to cross through here, but this route is dangerous."
00:43:52.708,00:43:55.750,It's easy for them to ambush us because of the narrow alleys.
00:43:55.750,00:44:01.000,"When we were kids we'd throw rocks at the Americans, then use the alleys to escape."
00:44:01.000,00:44:06.416,"They're narrower than Humvees, so they couldn't chase us."
00:45:49.041,00:45:50.416,Let him suffer.
00:45:50.416,00:45:51.416,What?
00:45:51.416,00:45:52.791,Leave him.
00:46:25.625,00:46:26.625,Amir.
00:46:27.625,00:46:29.083,Take up a sniper position.
00:46:29.083,00:46:30.791,"On this side, got it?"
00:46:31.750,00:46:34.041,"Razak, Akram and Youness..."
00:46:34.416,00:46:35.458,"Yes, Sir?"
00:46:35.458,00:46:38.000,Go to Waleed. He's going to walk you through how we get there.
00:46:54.208,00:46:56.750,...there are tight alleys the Humvees can't pass through.
00:46:56.750,00:47:01.958,We'll have to be on foot. It's going to be rough.
00:47:02.791,00:47:04.791,Get me the hammer from my bag.
00:47:24.000,00:47:25.083,What's your name?
00:47:25.083,00:47:27.041,Amir. And you're Kawa?
00:47:27.291,00:47:28.291,Yeah.
00:47:28.625,00:47:29.625,Good to meet you.
00:47:30.791,00:47:31.916,Good to meet you too.
00:47:34.666,00:47:35.833,Fuck!
00:47:36.625,00:47:37.625,Sir?
00:47:38.416,00:47:39.541,Please come look.
00:47:41.250,00:47:42.458,"Sorry Sir, but please look."
00:47:43.833,00:47:44.458,What's wrong?
00:47:53.041,00:47:57.375,Between the pink building and the parking lot on the left...
00:48:00.166,00:48:01.375,See it?
00:48:08.291,00:48:11.958,Do you think that's one of their bases?
00:48:19.375,00:48:20.375,Yes.
00:48:23.250,00:48:25.250,We could try to call in artillery.
00:48:25.250,00:48:26.125,No I can't.
00:48:27.000,00:48:29.208,Our people would deny the request...
00:48:29.208,00:48:32.458,"...scrap our mission, and throw me in jail. You should know this."
00:48:33.666,00:48:36.166,I could call my buddy at the Joint Operations Center...
00:48:36.166,00:48:38.958,"...give him this grid, see if the Americans could airstrike?"
00:48:38.958,00:48:39.833,No.
00:48:39.833,00:48:40.875,I grew up with him.
00:48:40.875,00:48:41.916,I said no.
00:48:42.333,00:48:46.125,They flatten everything because they don't have to rebuild anything.
00:48:46.125,00:48:49.833,Don't talk about the Americans anymore. We're past that.
00:48:52.041,00:48:56.500,If we attack what looks like an enemy base...
00:48:57.916,00:48:59.541,...we'll have to assault it ourselves.
00:49:00.541,00:49:01.250,10 Men.
00:49:04.416,00:49:05.625,It's your decision.
00:49:10.916,00:49:12.875,"Sir, you're our Commander, not me."
00:49:12.875,00:49:14.708,Why are you putting this on me?
00:49:14.708,00:49:15.708,Because I'm tired.
00:49:15.708,00:49:17.791,These are 10 Men. And I'm tired too.
00:49:18.583,00:49:20.041,"I'm tired too, Sir."
00:49:20.041,00:49:22.000,In two hours I've lost two of my sons.
00:49:22.000,00:49:23.791,In two hours I've lost two of my brothers.
00:49:24.166,00:49:25.250,"We all lost them, Sir."
00:49:25.250,00:49:25.875,Waleed!
00:49:25.875,00:49:26.625,Sir!
00:49:26.625,00:49:27.083,Waleed!
00:49:27.083,00:49:28.166,Don't shout Sir!
00:49:30.083,00:49:32.375,Do we wipe that base out?
00:49:32.541,00:49:35.791,So we can stop worrying about what's right behind us?
00:49:35.791,00:49:39.041,Or do we bypass it and try to stay unseen and unheard?
00:49:39.041,00:49:40.541,"Sir, I beg you."
00:49:41.166,00:49:43.041,Waleed! You pick!
00:49:43.541,00:49:45.041,These are 10 Men.
00:49:45.375,00:49:46.625,Making them my...
00:49:56.541,00:49:57.791,I say we can go around it...
00:49:58.875,00:50:00.375,...we can stay unnoticed.
00:50:04.125,00:50:05.291,Anyone see it?
00:50:06.416,00:50:07.458,Spot it?
00:50:09.416,00:50:10.750,Call it if you see it.
00:50:11.041,00:50:12.250,No one fires.
00:50:13.458,00:50:14.541,We need every bullet.
00:50:15.916,00:50:16.916,Take cover!
00:50:23.625,00:50:25.083,That was C4 or PETN.
00:50:28.333,00:50:29.500,You okay?
00:50:38.541,00:50:41.208,"Sir, one of our Humvees is gone!"
00:51:11.333,00:51:13.833,DHL will deliver anywhere.
00:51:14.458,00:51:15.833,Barter?
00:51:16.541,00:51:18.000,For what?
00:51:18.583,00:51:21.750,7.62 Sorry. Shooting 5-5-6.
00:51:23.125,00:51:28.375,"An Iranian Special Forces Colonel, in Iraq, using an American rifle, firing NATO ammo?"
00:51:28.791,00:51:30.583,Crazy world.
00:51:30.791,00:51:32.166,Someone should sell tickets.
00:51:35.250,00:51:38.833,"We still have some boxes of 7.62, just in case."
00:51:39.916,00:51:41.833,I believe in contingencies.
00:51:41.833,00:51:43.250,What do you need?
00:51:44.208,00:51:45.208,Cigarettes.
00:51:45.791,00:51:46.791,Those we have.
00:51:47.958,00:51:51.833,Nicotine and bullets bring the world together.
00:51:51.833,00:51:54.041,Meet me right in front of our building.
00:51:54.041,00:51:55.458,Okay.
00:51:56.625,00:51:59.666,Stay low and get down to the street. Fast.
00:51:59.666,00:52:01.625,"Amir, Kawa, let's go."
00:52:10.083,00:52:12.041,Leave him. Let him suffer.
00:52:43.500,00:52:44.500,Get your hands off me!
00:52:44.500,00:52:45.583,"Calm down, calm down..."
00:52:46.333,00:52:48.708,Just the one the Colonel was talking to.
00:52:48.708,00:52:50.208,Are you stupid?
00:52:51.625,00:52:53.291,"Sir, Kamal and I can't let you go alone."
00:52:55.083,00:52:57.250,"Waleed, we have no choice."
00:53:00.250,00:53:03.083,"Take care, I won't be long."
00:53:13.750,00:53:14.875,Peace be upon you.
00:53:14.875,00:53:16.833,And upon you. Welcome.
00:53:29.333,00:53:30.875,What?
00:53:31.041,00:53:34.375,Have you never been this close to a Popular Mobilization Force?
00:53:36.416,00:53:38.166,I've been this close to many.
00:53:38.166,00:53:40.291,I've even fought alongside a few.
00:53:41.208,00:53:46.875,But I've always kept my distance from your particular group.
00:53:47.125,00:53:49.458,It's a pleasure to meet you too.
00:53:49.458,00:53:50.833,I'm Colonel Isfahani.
00:53:50.833,00:53:53.208,What brings you to our part of the City?
00:53:53.208,00:53:55.500,I was born in this part of the City.
00:53:55.500,00:53:58.208,I'll guess most of your Men were too.
00:53:58.208,00:54:02.833,The better question is why are you here? Such a long way from your family?
00:54:02.833,00:54:04.166,Logistical support.
00:54:04.166,00:54:05.125,Logistics.
00:54:05.125,00:54:06.250,Indeed.
00:54:06.708,00:54:07.958,How many cartons is that?
00:54:07.958,00:54:09.583,13 Cartons.
00:54:10.041,00:54:12.291,Did you guys hijack a truck?
00:54:13.666,00:54:16.916,Looks like maybe one carton for each of your men.
00:54:17.541,00:54:19.750,We're not all equal.
00:54:20.208,00:54:21.166,Tea?
00:54:21.166,00:54:22.416,No thanks.
00:54:22.416,00:54:24.458,Please have some tea.
00:54:24.458,00:54:26.541,Let's make it quick.
00:54:29.583,00:54:32.000,What are you doing? Keep your eyes on the street.
00:54:32.333,00:54:35.166,You let him go down there without his weapon?
00:54:35.541,00:54:37.000,Jasem's a wolf.
00:54:37.000,00:54:38.208,Don't worry about him.
00:54:39.083,00:54:40.500,Waleed was worried.
00:54:40.583,00:54:42.291,Waleed has his reasons.
00:54:42.291,00:54:43.791,Focus on your role.
00:54:44.750,00:54:48.583,3 cartons for each box- -1 carton for 1 box.
00:54:48.583,00:54:49.750,Make it quick.
00:54:55.375,00:54:57.250,You're SWAT...
00:54:57.250,00:55:00.208,...so I assume you were all police once?
00:55:00.208,00:55:01.750,We still are Police.
00:55:01.750,00:55:02.916,And you are from this City?
00:55:02.916,00:55:05.250,I told you: born and raised.
00:55:06.291,00:55:09.666,Okay. One box for one carton...
00:55:09.666,00:55:13.875,...you take a look at our prisoners to see if you can identify any?
00:55:14.083,00:55:15.041,Deal?
00:55:15.041,00:55:16.708,Deal. Let's go.
00:55:21.916,00:55:24.375,Finally some cigs.
00:55:24.375,00:55:25.541,I don't know him.
00:55:27.541,00:55:28.666,I don't know him.
00:55:31.208,00:55:33.000,Kawa get down here right now!
00:55:46.625,00:55:48.625,Kawa! Get in here right now!
00:55:49.083,00:55:50.458,"This is your partner, isn't it?"
00:55:58.500,00:55:59.625,That's him.
00:56:03.333,00:56:07.166,I knew you wouldn't still be in the cafe...
00:56:07.708,00:56:08.708,...I knew you wouldn't.
00:56:09.208,00:56:14.708,"Colonel, let me take him. He gave us away to Daesh."
00:56:15.583,00:56:16.750,So we don't have a problem.
00:56:19.250,00:56:20.250,No.
00:56:21.166,00:56:22.791,I screamed...
00:56:23.625,00:56:25.000,They beat me!
00:56:27.041,00:56:34.500,"Told me if I didn't show them your position, they would find my family in America."
00:56:37.916,00:56:38.833,He's ours.
00:56:40.625,00:56:41.666,Don't hit him.
00:56:41.958,00:56:44.041,Don't hit him like that again.
00:56:44.333,00:56:45.541,He's ours.
00:56:45.541,00:56:46.250,No.
00:56:46.250,00:56:47.708,They took my phone.
00:56:49.291,00:56:52.708,"They found my grandson in Michigan, on Facebook."
00:56:52.708,00:56:55.333,...there was no additional quid pro quo if you did actually identify a face.
00:56:55.333,00:57:01.375,"I looked around for you, to try to see you- -you didn't. I saw you throw the flare and run."
00:57:01.500,00:57:02.916,If it were me I'd give him to you.
00:57:02.916,00:57:04.666,You're not me.
00:57:04.666,00:57:07.000,That's right: I'm an Iraqi in Iraq.
00:57:08.083,00:57:10.541,You're Iraqis too - or have you forgotten?
00:57:10.541,00:57:13.125,And what a wonderful job of stewardship you've done here.
00:57:13.208,00:57:14.583,I'm not the enemy!
00:57:14.583,00:57:15.375,It's always darkest before the dawn.
00:57:15.375,00:57:16.791,It's always darkest before the dawn. I'm not the enemy!
00:57:16.791,00:57:17.333,The dawn of what?
00:57:17.333,00:57:18.750,The dawn of what? Check your list again!
00:57:19.000,00:57:20.416,I'm not the enemy! Check your list!
00:57:20.500,00:57:24.875,"An Iraq without Sadaam, the West, Terrorists, or an Iranian Colonel."
00:57:24.958,00:57:29.000,"Without us, you'll curse yourselves with something or someone else."
00:57:31.250,00:57:32.166,You know why?
00:57:32.166,00:57:34.458,I'm sure you'll tell me.
00:57:34.458,00:57:39.125,Because you're not a real country. You haven't been since Babylon.
00:57:39.125,00:57:43.916,You were created by a drunk British dilettante and a French bureaucrat with inaccurate maps.
00:57:43.916,00:57:48.250,And you by angry children who took hostages.
00:57:48.250,00:57:49.500,Fuck you all!
00:57:49.500,00:57:53.375,You'll break into at least three pieces once we finish off Daesh.
00:57:53.375,00:57:54.583,That shouldn't be hard now!
00:57:54.583,00:57:58.541,After the 3 years we've spent killing their toughest and best Fighters!
00:57:58.541,00:58:01.416,What part of those 3 years were spent running from them?
00:58:01.416,00:58:05.125,"Iraqi Army rifle for sale, never been fired, only dropped once."
00:58:05.125,00:58:07.416,"You got the wrong Unit, Colonel!"
00:58:07.416,00:58:12.375,Fuck you all! I have killed more enemies than all of you!
00:58:12.375,00:58:15.291,All I've ever known is war!
00:58:15.291,00:58:17.541,So both of you can go fuck yourselves!
00:58:17.541,00:58:21.291,"Iranian, Kuwaiti, American, Al Qaeda- -shut up!"
00:58:21.291,00:58:22.291,Shut up!
00:58:22.750,00:58:23.750,Shut up!
00:58:24.875,00:58:25.916,Is that a challenge?
00:58:26.041,00:59:18.041,I'm not the enemy! I'm not the en- Okay...
00:59:18.041,00:59:20.625,...one box for one carton.
00:59:39.416,00:59:40.416,Chill...
00:59:41.041,00:59:42.083,Calm down.
00:59:43.166,00:59:45.166,"Sinan, take two boxes."
00:59:46.791,00:59:49.458,This used to belong to our friend...
00:59:51.250,00:59:53.291,Trade this for your RPG?
00:59:55.083,00:59:56.291,What's happening here?
00:59:56.458,00:59:58.208,A hookah for the RPG.
01:00:00.000,01:00:03.041,Fine. Just the one rocket though.
01:00:05.125,01:00:06.541,Why'd you do that?
01:00:07.291,01:00:10.791,We need more than bullets to wipe out that base.
01:00:10.791,01:00:13.791,I was wrong before. We can't leave it behind us.
01:00:15.625,01:00:18.416,"I told you, it's your call. Move."
01:00:49.708,01:00:56.041,"The reason we can't go back for ammo, or call in artillery strikes..."
01:00:57.625,01:01:00.791,...or sleep on mattresses on the safe side of the City...
01:01:00.791,01:01:03.000,...is because we're disobeying orders.
01:01:03.000,01:01:05.333,Disobeying 'new' orders I should say.
01:01:06.833,01:01:10.625,"A month ago, we were given a mission."
01:01:10.625,01:01:14.625,A mission we all wanted. A mission I planned.
01:01:16.291,01:01:20.500,"Two weeks later, we were put under a new Army Command."
01:01:20.500,01:01:22.541,And that Command scrapped our mission...
01:01:22.541,01:01:26.833,...and tried to send us to a village miles from here. Miles from our fight.
01:01:26.833,01:01:29.750,So we stopped taking their calls.
01:01:30.875,01:01:36.000,"And kept on with our old mission, which is to- -I don't need to know anymore."
01:01:36.208,01:01:38.208,Don't want to know.
01:01:38.458,01:01:44.291,Tell me what I need to know when I need to know it and I'll do it.
01:01:46.083,01:01:48.666,Whatever it is.
01:02:49.166,01:02:51.833,"Razak, end of the line."
01:03:00.333,01:03:01.500,I don't like this.
01:03:34.333,01:03:35.208,No!
01:03:45.541,01:03:47.541,RPG! RPG!
01:03:47.541,01:03:49.416,No! It's not for this!
01:04:03.625,01:04:04.666,Get down!
01:04:14.375,01:04:16.375,We got them! Blew their heads off!
01:04:16.375,01:04:17.458,Kawa's injured!
01:04:17.458,01:04:18.458,Youness!
01:04:18.750,01:04:19.375,Youness!
01:04:22.208,01:04:23.333,Be careful.
01:04:25.666,01:04:26.416,Clear!
01:04:34.000,01:04:35.750,"Waleed, hold him."
01:04:35.750,01:04:37.000,Kawa.
01:04:37.958,01:04:39.083,Can you hear me?
01:04:57.333,01:04:58.666,I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it.
01:04:59.041,01:05:01.541,They were firing at us. I had to throw the grenade.
01:05:02.666,01:05:04.875,I swear to God I didn't see him. He ran in front.
01:05:06.250,01:05:09.083,I got something.
01:05:12.041,01:05:13.375,"God rest your soul, Youness."
01:05:18.875,01:05:20.750,Enough. Enough.
01:05:28.458,01:05:29.875,Is his injury bad?
01:05:31.208,01:05:33.125,Ugly gash.
01:05:33.125,01:05:35.291,How many fingers?
01:05:35.291,01:05:36.291,Three.
01:05:36.291,01:05:38.166,Let's go champ. Let's go.
01:05:38.416,01:05:40.208,Let's go guys. Get your weapons.
01:07:04.041,01:07:07.375,"May God bless you, keep you safe."
01:07:08.916,01:07:10.125,Cigarettes? Cigarettes?
01:07:11.666,01:07:13.750,I just want a cigarette.
01:08:24.291,01:08:25.125,You okay?
01:08:25.125,01:08:26.583,It's a small injury.
01:08:26.583,01:08:27.625,Everyone okay?
01:08:29.000,01:08:30.083,Razak?
01:08:30.083,01:08:31.083,Clear!
01:08:39.791,01:08:40.833,Razak is dead.
01:08:50.250,01:08:51.791,Pick up his ammo and let's move.
01:09:01.333,01:09:03.291,"Fuck you, you son of a bitch."
01:09:21.083,01:09:24.375,"Guys, Sinan is bleeding."
01:09:26.750,01:09:28.041,We need to get going.
01:09:30.333,01:09:31.416,Kamal?
01:09:32.000,01:09:33.083,How's Sinan?
01:09:33.583,01:09:34.666,He's okay Jasem.
01:09:36.625,01:09:37.666,Make it quick.
01:09:38.000,01:09:39.041,It's dangerous here.
01:09:39.291,01:09:40.583,We need to get going.
01:09:42.708,01:09:44.083,Sinan are you okay?
01:09:44.083,01:09:45.083,I'm okay.
01:09:46.000,01:09:47.541,"Kamal, make it quick."
01:09:49.333,01:09:51.833,We're close to their base. Work quickly.
01:09:55.750,01:09:57.041,We're in the open Kamal.
01:09:58.083,01:09:59.416,"Guys, he's injured!"
01:10:13.625,01:10:15.125,Let's get moving guys.
01:10:39.666,01:10:40.958,"Stop right here, Sir."
01:10:44.208,01:10:47.833,Their base is on the other side of these buildings.
01:10:48.750,01:10:50.250,We're real close.
01:11:00.250,01:11:01.291,"Waleed, come with me."
01:11:02.208,01:11:04.458,Everyone else hold here.
01:11:39.375,01:11:40.958,Look at these fools.
01:11:42.458,01:11:45.833,Loading up ammo and money out in the open.
01:11:48.333,01:11:50.125,Seems like they are running away.
01:11:50.125,01:11:52.250,"Who cares if they're running, Sir?"
01:11:52.666,01:11:53.875,So we attack?
01:11:53.875,01:11:55.083,"Yes, we attack."
01:12:19.958,01:12:22.000,"Alright, this is how we're going to do this..."
01:12:43.875,01:12:44.958,It's a dud! It's a dud!
01:12:45.041,01:12:48.583,Dud! Dud! Move and I will cover you!
01:13:21.416,01:13:23.208,Waleed go down!
01:13:45.958,01:13:49.166,Breathe. Breathe.
01:13:49.166,01:13:51.958,Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.
01:14:03.833,01:14:06.125,"Kamal, move next to Sinan."
01:14:06.916,01:14:07.458,Akram?
01:14:08.291,01:14:09.458,"He's dead, Sir."
01:14:09.458,01:14:11.125,May he rest in peace. Get moving.
01:14:11.541,01:14:13.583,"Listen, listen."
01:14:13.583,01:14:15.541,"Kamal, go through the opening on the right."
01:14:15.541,01:14:17.041,Secure the area.
01:14:17.041,01:14:19.583,"Kawa, Waleed you're with me."
01:15:35.750,01:15:36.750,Clear?
01:15:47.375,01:15:48.375,Clear?
01:15:48.875,01:15:50.125,Clear!
01:16:05.375,01:16:06.750,"Guys, everyone okay?"
01:16:08.958,01:16:10.625,We got 90 seconds.
01:16:10.625,01:16:14.583,Stay alert. There might be more.
01:16:14.583,01:16:18.250,"Reload, hydrate, then we finish."
01:16:26.041,01:16:27.416,Take some water for the team.
01:16:28.000,01:16:29.291,"Is everyone okay, Sir?"
01:16:29.375,01:16:31.875,"Amir, you stay there and cover that side."
01:16:33.375,01:16:34.916,We got 90 seconds.
01:16:49.708,01:16:50.750,Kamal?
01:16:51.666,01:16:52.583,What?
01:16:52.583,01:16:53.916,"Tramadol, can he use it?"
01:16:54.375,01:16:55.375,Yes he can.
01:16:55.375,01:16:56.791,Sinan...
01:17:28.000,01:17:31.875,Everything about them is empty.
01:17:32.500,01:17:33.666,Sinan can you move?
01:18:02.541,01:18:03.541,Sir!
01:19:06.500,01:19:08.500,90 seconds is up.
01:19:08.500,01:19:11.375,"We can come back for all our dead, but 90 seconds is up."
01:19:11.791,01:19:13.250,Do you even know where we're going?
01:19:13.625,01:19:15.458,What we've been doing?
01:19:16.583,01:19:18.125,Who are you?
01:19:18.416,01:19:20.333,I'm one of you.
01:19:21.083,01:19:22.291,I know.
01:19:22.958,01:19:25.500,I know it has to add up to something more than all this.
01:19:26.166,01:19:30.166,"Or none of you would still be doing this, fighting like this."
01:19:30.166,01:19:34.916,Suffering like this on the shit side of the City if it wasn't for something bigger.
01:19:35.583,01:19:37.208,We must move.
01:19:40.750,01:19:42.750,He's right.
01:19:46.208,01:19:50.083,There are six of us. We can finish the mission.
01:19:51.750,01:19:53.250,Or all die.
01:19:55.791,01:19:56.958,What are you saying?
01:19:57.875,01:19:59.791,Our plan is fucked!
01:20:00.250,01:20:01.708,Major Jasem was everything to us.
01:20:01.708,01:20:03.041,Our plan is fucked!
01:20:04.500,01:20:06.041,Let's think of another way...
01:20:08.416,01:20:10.875,This is Major Jasem.
01:20:12.666,01:20:14.291,Our Father.
01:20:19.875,01:20:21.958,Without him this will turn to shit.
01:20:21.958,01:20:23.750,Waleed.
01:20:24.125,01:20:27.500,It has already turned to shit hundreds of times.
01:20:28.500,01:20:30.666,And yet we're still here.
01:20:31.291,01:20:33.250,"Three blocks away, Brother."
01:20:34.041,01:20:36.000,Three blocks.
01:20:57.291,01:20:59.041,"Two blocks, Kamal."
01:21:27.916,01:21:29.291,The blue satellite...
01:22:03.125,01:22:05.750,Stay on me. We're going up four flights. Don't separate.
01:22:05.750,01:22:08.250,Any man you see in this building should die.
01:22:08.833,01:22:12.625,Only those with suppressors should shoot. Everybody else try to use blades.
01:22:12.625,01:22:14.083,Only fire if you need to.
01:22:23.583,01:22:25.833,Radios off.
01:22:33.958,01:22:35.291,Ready?
01:24:00.041,01:24:01.041,Waleed.
01:24:01.541,01:24:03.250,We're being seen. How do you want to do this?
01:24:30.208,01:24:31.583,Waleed.
01:24:31.791,01:24:34.083,Take a breath and calm down.
01:24:41.625,01:24:42.833,Ready?
01:24:43.291,01:24:44.333,One.
01:24:45.291,01:24:46.250,Two.
01:24:46.250,01:24:47.041,Waleed.
01:24:47.666,01:24:48.750,Let Amir do it.
01:24:48.750,01:24:51.375,No Kamal. I'll do it.
01:24:51.375,01:24:52.625,Ready?
01:25:11.708,01:25:13.333,Hayat it's me!
01:25:15.166,01:25:17.250,"Dunia, it's your Dad."
01:25:23.166,01:25:24.125,Hayat...
01:25:24.125,01:25:25.291,Waleed?
01:25:26.708,01:25:28.000,Waleed!
01:25:32.291,01:25:34.166,Where have you been?
01:25:36.208,01:25:37.250,Daddy?
01:25:47.041,01:25:49.500,I thought you were dead.
01:25:57.458,01:25:59.458,I'm here with you.
01:26:15.625,01:26:17.541,Where were you?
01:26:23.041,01:26:25.333,Do you know how long you've been away?
01:26:46.500,01:26:47.791,Let me check your injury.
01:26:53.833,01:26:55.583,I missed you so much.
01:27:03.500,01:27:05.125,Does it add up to more?
01:27:10.666,01:27:13.000,Are we doing this for everybody on the team?
01:27:14.125,01:27:17.083,For those whose families weren't murdered when the City fell.
01:27:24.375,01:27:26.250,I'm pregnant.
01:27:45.083,01:27:46.333,It's my fault.
01:27:48.708,01:27:51.333,I couldn't come back for you.
01:27:52.125,01:27:54.416,God knows I tried.
01:27:55.208,01:27:56.375,I tried.
01:27:56.875,01:27:59.500,I swear to God I couldn't get back to you.
01:28:02.750,01:28:04.000,Why?
01:28:04.000,01:28:06.333,Jasem.
01:28:06.333,01:28:08.708,This was all Major Jasem.
01:28:09.500,01:28:12.458,Because the youngest have more time to have more children.
01:28:12.458,01:28:14.708,More children brings back our City faster.
01:28:35.625,01:28:37.916,Amir's wife died.
01:28:38.791,01:28:41.416,But his little boy is still alive.
01:28:42.375,01:28:45.666,As of last week. We got information on him.
01:28:49.500,01:28:51.791,Did Major Jasem have a family?
01:28:53.125,01:28:55.000,Yes he did.
01:28:56.291,01:29:02.291,Daesh knew who we were because we had arrested so many of them before.
01:29:03.041,01:29:07.708,They were all common criminals before there ever was a Daesh to join.
01:29:07.708,01:29:13.166,A man Jasem put in prison became one of their Commanders.
01:29:13.166,01:29:16.416,He found the Major's family...
01:29:25.750,01:29:27.083,Pack your things.
01:29:35.916,01:29:37.333,Why are you putting that on?
01:29:38.375,01:29:40.458,You're not going to come with us?
01:29:47.583,01:29:49.708,Don't be afraid.
01:29:51.625,01:29:53.125,I'm with you.
01:29:53.791,01:29:55.458,We don't have much time.
01:29:59.125,01:30:01.416,We don't have much time my love.
01:30:56.208,01:30:59.666,Do you know how much I love you?
01:31:51.041,01:31:54.041,How far from here is your Son?
