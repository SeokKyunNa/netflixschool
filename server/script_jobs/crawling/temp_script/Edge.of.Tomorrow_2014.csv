00:42:15.200,00:42:17.076,IT CONTROLS THEM ALL.
00:42:17.118,00:42:18.619,AND THIS IS THE OMEGA.
00:42:18.661,00:42:24.250,AND THE OMEGA HAS THE ABILITY TO CONTROL TIME.
00:42:24.292,00:42:25.877,WHENEVER AN ALPHA IS KILLED...
00:42:25.918,00:42:29.130,RESPONSE IS TRIGGERED.
00:42:29.172,00:42:32.091,THE OMEGA STARTS THE DAY OVER AGAIN.
00:42:32.133,00:42:35.678,"BUT YOU SEE, THIS TIME IT CAN REMEMBER WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN..."
00:42:35.720,00:42:37.722,JUST LIKE YOU DO.
00:42:37.763,00:42:40.225,I-I-IT KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO BEFORE WE'RE GONNA DO IT.
00:42:40.266,00:42:41.934,AND AN ENEMY THAT KNOWS THE FUTURE CAN'T LOSE.
00:42:41.976,00:42:42.977,IT CAN'T LOSE.
00:42:46.064,00:42:48.233,"BUT IF THAT'S TRUE, HOW DID YOU WIN AT VERDUN?"
00:42:48.274,00:42:50.026,WE WERE ALLOWED TO WIN.
00:42:50.068,00:42:53.321,THIS THING WANTS US TO BELIEVE WE CAN WIN.
00:42:53.363,00:42:56.741,IT WANTS US TO THROW EVERYTHING WE HAVE INTO THE INVASION.
00:42:56.782,00:43:01.746,"OPERATION DOWNFALL ISN'T OUR ENDGAME, IT'S THE ENEMY'S."
00:43:01.787,00:43:08.836,"THE THING YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND IS THIS IS A PERFECTLY EVOLVED, WORLD-CONQUERING ORGANISM."
00:43:08.878,00:43:15.385,"FOR ALL WE KNOW, THERE ARE THOUSANDS, MILLIONS OF THOSE ASTEROIDS FLOATING AROUND IN THE COSMOS LIKE A VIRUS."
00:43:15.427,00:43:19.347,AND THEY'RE JUST WAITING TO CRASH-LAND INTO A WORLD WITH JUST THE RIGHT CONDITIONS.
00:43:19.389,00:43:28.064,ALL THEY NEED IS FOR THE DOMINANT LIFE FORM TO ATTACK AND AND THERE'LL BE NOTHING TO STOP THE MIMICS FROM CONQUERING THE REST OF THE WORLD.
00:43:28.106,00:43:30.233,UNLESS YOU CHANGE THE OUTCOME.
00:43:30.275,00:43:32.235,ME?
00:43:32.277,00:43:35.405,"WHEN YOU KILLED THAT ALPHA, YOU INADVERTENTLY ENTERED THE ENEMY'S NERVOUS SYSTEM."
00:43:35.447,00:43:36.781,CAGE.
00:43:36.822,00:43:40.743,YOU'VE SEIZED CONTROL OF THE OMEGA'S ABILITY TO RESET THE DAY.
00:43:40.785,00:43:44.414,HOW'S THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?
00:43:44.456,00:43:49.001,"PERHAPS THIS ORGANISM'S ONLY VULNERABILITY, I-ITS ONLY VULNERABILITY IS HUMANITY."
00:43:49.043,00:43:52.797,"REGARDLESS OF THAT, YOU CONTROL THE POWER NOW."
00:43:52.838,00:43:54.882,JUST AS I DID IN VERDUN.
00:43:54.924,00:43:56.926,SO I'M RESETTING THE DAY?
00:43:58.470,00:44:01.055,OKAY.
00:44:01.097,00:44:02.890,HOW DO I CONTROL IT?
00:44:05.268,00:44:07.686,YOU HAVE TO DIE.
00:44:07.728,00:44:09.314,EVERY DAY.
00:44:09.355,00:44:11.941,UNTIL THE OMEGA'S DESTROYED.
00:44:24.120,00:44:26.331,FIRST OF ALL...
00:44:26.372,00:44:27.873,THIS IS A TERRIFIC PRESENTATION.
00:44:27.915,00:44:30.460,TERRIFIC.
00:44:30.502,00:44:32.545,I KNOW THE GENERAL.
00:44:32.587,00:44:35.340,WE SHOULD TAKE THIS TO HIM.
00:44:35.381,00:44:37.550,YOU JUST TELL HIM EVERYTHING YOU TOLD ME.
00:44:37.592,00:44:39.427,"HE WILL KNOW WHAT-- I WENT TO SEE THE GENERAL, CAGE."
00:44:39.469,00:44:41.638,ANY NUMBER OF TIMES.
00:44:41.679,00:44:43.973,PSYCH WARD.
00:44:44.015,00:44:45.350,REMEMBER?
00:44:47.893,00:44:50.938,WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING FROM ME?
00:44:53.358,00:44:55.485,HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING STRANGE?
00:44:55.527,00:44:58.029,IS HE SHITTING ME?
00:44:58.070,00:44:59.864,VISIONS.
00:44:59.905,00:45:01.533,HAVE YOU SEEN ANY VISIONS LIKE THAT?
00:45:01.574,00:45:05.953,THE OMEGA SENSES WHEN IT'S LOSING CONTROL OF ITS POWER.
00:45:05.995,00:45:08.039,E-EVEN NOW IT'S MENTALLY SEARCHING TO FIND YOU.
00:45:08.080,00:45:12.043,"Rita: WHEN IT'S CLOSE TO FINDING YOU, YOU WILL START HAVING VISIONS."
00:45:12.084,00:45:13.586,YOU'LL START TO SEE THAT.
00:45:13.628,00:45:15.754,EH-- YOU'LL EVEN SEE WHERE IT IS.
00:45:15.796,00:45:18.799,AND YOU HAD THESE VISIONS?
00:45:18.841,00:45:20.468,YES.
00:45:22.637,00:45:24.389,BUT EVENTUALLY YOU SAW IT.
00:45:24.430,00:45:26.516,"I MEAN, YOU ACTUALLY SAW IT."
00:45:26.558,00:45:29.602,RIGHT?
00:45:29.644,00:45:31.521,NEVER IN THE FLESH.
00:45:35.525,00:45:40.779,SO THIS IS ALL JUST SOME...THEORY.
00:45:40.821,00:45:43.991,YOU DON'T KNOW IF THIS THING EVEN EXISTS.
00:45:44.033,00:45:45.951,THE VISIONS SHOWED ME IT WAS AT VERDUN.
00:45:45.993,00:45:48.079,I COULD SEE IT.
00:45:45.993,00:45:52.584,I-- I JUST...LOST THE POWER BEFORE I COULD GET TO IT.
00:45:52.625,00:45:56.504,AND BY THE TIME WE TOOK VERDUN...
00:45:56.546,00:45:59.424,THE OMEGA WAS GONE.
00:45:59.465,00:46:02.260,OKAY.
00:46:02.301,00:46:10.059,"SO ALL I HAVE TO DO IS WAIT TO HAVE THESE...VISIONS, AND THEN TELL YOU WHERE THIS...OMEGA THING IS."
00:46:10.101,00:46:11.603,NO. CAGE.
00:46:11.644,00:46:13.938,YOU'RE GONNA GET ME THERE.
00:46:13.979,00:46:16.107,AND I'M GONNA KILL IT.
00:46:16.148,00:46:18.817,GET YOU THERE?
00:46:18.859,00:46:20.069,I'M NOT...
00:46:20.111,00:46:22.905,I'M NOT EVEN TRAINED FOR COMBAT.
00:46:38.671,00:46:39.547,RELOAD.
00:46:39.589,00:46:41.924,RELOAD.
00:46:59.900,00:47:02.445,"ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, CAGE?"
00:47:02.487,00:47:04.196,I THINK I BROKE SOMETHING.
00:47:04.238,00:47:06.157,WHAT?
00:47:06.198,00:47:08.576,MY BACK.
00:47:08.618,00:47:11.746,THE ONLY THING I CAN FEEL ARE MY-MY LIPS.
00:47:11.788,00:47:14.666,NOW LISTEN CAREFULLY.
00:47:14.707,00:47:17.335,THIS IS THE ONLY RULE.
00:47:17.376,00:47:21.172,"YOU GET INJURED ON THE FIELD, YOU BETTER MAKE SURE YOU DIE."
00:47:21.213,00:47:22.965,WHY?
00:47:23.007,00:47:26.427,"LAST TIME I WAS IN COMBAT, I WAS HIT."
00:47:26.469,00:47:30.181,I WAS BLEEDING OUT.
00:47:30.222,00:47:36.187,I WOKE UP IN A FIELD HOSPITAL WITH THREE PINTS OF SOMEONE ELSE'S BLOOD AND I WAS OUT.
00:47:36.228,00:47:39.691,I LOST THE POWER.
00:47:39.732,00:47:42.694,THINK WE BETTER START OVER.
00:47:47.239,00:47:49.200,Farell: NO ONE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED TO PRIVATE CAGE!
00:47:49.241,00:47:51.285,"SKINNER, YOU DUMB-ASS."
00:47:51.327,00:47:54.580,YOU'RE TELLIN' ME YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT SLIPPERY SON OF A BITCH WENT?
00:47:54.622,00:47:55.914,"NO, SARGE!"
00:47:55.956,00:47:57.625,ALL RIGHT.
00:47:57.667,00:47:59.460,"LET'S DO ANOTHER FIFTY, SHALL WE?"
00:47:59.502,00:48:01.086,AND ONE!
00:48:01.128,00:48:03.339,"NO, WAIT! WAIT."
00:48:03.381,00:48:05.966,I-- WE MET ON THE BEACH.
00:48:06.008,00:48:08.219,TOMORROW.
00:48:13.890,00:48:15.560,"ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO AGAIN."
00:48:20.064,00:48:22.567,YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO THINK.
00:48:22.608,00:48:25.069,IT'S NOT ENOUGH KNOWING WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE.
00:48:25.110,00:48:27.988,YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO KILL THEM.
00:48:31.283,00:48:33.494,"I JUST, OH-- HOLD ON."
00:48:33.536,00:48:35.830,LISTEN.
00:48:37.498,00:48:38.666,DO IT.
00:48:40.292,00:48:42.002,"ON YOUR FEET, MAGGOT!"
00:48:45.798,00:48:47.966,STOP! WAIT!
00:48:48.008,00:48:49.802,STOP! WAIT!
00:48:49.844,00:48:52.638,WAIT A SECOND.
00:48:52.680,00:48:55.140,"YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THINKING."
00:48:55.182,00:48:58.227,"I MEAN, THIS THING'S IN MY BLOOD."
00:48:58.269,00:49:00.271,SO MAYBE THERE'S SOME WAY...
00:49:00.312,00:49:02.774,I CAN TRANSFER IT TO YOU.
00:49:02.815,00:49:05.150,I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING.
00:49:05.192,00:49:08.780,"I MEAN, HAVE YOU...YOU KNOW..."
00:49:08.821,00:49:12.575,TRIED ALL- ALL THE OPTIONS.
00:49:12.617,00:49:15.202,"OH, YOU MEAN SEX."
00:49:15.244,00:49:17.288,HOW MANY TIMES?
00:49:17.329,00:49:18.289,ALL RIGHT.
00:49:21.333,00:49:23.795,"LEFT, LEFT!"
00:49:21.333,00:49:27.715,"LEFT, LEFT, LE-- KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN."

00:49:33.846,00:49:35.640,AGAIN.
00:49:37.099,00:49:38.559,AGAIN.
00:49:45.190,00:49:47.819,JUST WAIT! WAIT.
00:49:50.112,00:49:51.155,"ON YOUR FEET, MAGGOT!"
00:49:51.196,00:49:52.657,MAGGOT!
00:49:52.698,00:49:54.826,"NOW, I'M TRYIN' TO BE NICE TO YOU, MAGGOT! NOW, MOVE!"
00:49:57.202,00:49:58.830,"ARE YOU OKAY, CAGE?"
00:49:58.871,00:50:00.832,"OH YEAH, YEAH!"
00:50:00.873,00:50:02.207,YOUR LEG'S BROKEN.
00:50:02.249,00:50:04.710,NO. I-- I CAN STILL FEEL MY TOES.
00:50:04.752,00:50:06.879,"OH, COME ON."
00:50:24.480,00:50:27.316,Man: ABOUT FACE!
00:50:27.358,00:50:30.277,RITA. R-RITA. WHAT IS THIS?
00:50:30.319,00:50:31.654,WHO-WHO'S THIS GUY?
00:50:31.696,00:50:33.865,HE'S ME...BEFORE VERDUN.
00:50:33.906,00:50:35.366,WHAT-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:50:36.868,00:50:38.703,WHERE?
00:50:38.744,00:50:40.120,TOMORROW.
00:50:40.162,00:50:41.413,WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE.
00:50:41.455,00:50:42.748,YOU HAVE TWO FINGERS BEHIND YOUR BACK.
00:50:42.790,00:50:44.583,I'VE HAD THE VISIONS.
00:50:44.625,00:50:45.877,I'VE SEEN THE OMEGA.
00:50:49.338,00:50:50.255,UM.
00:50:51.799,00:50:54.092,IT'S...PRETTY MUCH GAME OVER TOMORROW.
00:50:54.134,00:50:55.887,"SO, CAN WE MOVE THIS ALONG?"
00:50:55.928,00:50:59.181,OKAY. OKAY-- WHERE?
00:50:59.223,00:51:02.100,THERE'S A DAM.
00:51:02.142,00:51:03.895,IT'S IN THE MOUNTAINS.
00:51:03.936,00:51:05.938,Rita: DO YOU THINK YOU CAN WORK OUT WHERE THAT IS?
00:51:05.980,00:51:09.316,"W-WELL-- I MEAN, THERE CAN'T BE TOO MANY PLACES THAT FIT THAT DESCRIPTION."
00:51:09.358,00:51:10.401,I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.
00:51:10.442,00:51:12.695,TRAINING'S OVER.
00:51:12.737,00:51:14.405,I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
00:51:14.446,00:51:15.907,WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING.
00:51:15.948,00:51:17.199,WE WILL SOON ENOUGH.
00:51:17.241,00:51:21.245,"IN THE MEANTIME, YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET US OFF THAT BEACH."
00:51:43.267,00:51:45.394,WHAT NEXT?
00:51:45.436,00:51:46.938,WHICH WAY? FOCUS.
00:51:46.979,00:51:48.272,I'M THINKING.
00:51:48.313,00:51:49.982,OKAY.
00:51:50.024,00:51:51.943,HOW FAR DID WE MAKE IT?
00:51:51.984,00:51:55.111,"YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO SAY, REALLY."
00:51:55.153,00:51:58.074,IT'S-- HOLD!
00:51:58.114,00:51:59.324,HOLD!
00:51:59.366,00:52:01.243,"OKAY, GO!"
00:52:03.037,00:52:04.288,SON OF A BITCH!
00:52:04.329,00:52:07.458,"I THOUGHT STEPPING LEFT, DUCKING-- JUST FOR THE RECORD, STEPPING LEFT, DUCKING-- FINE."
00:52:07.499,00:52:08.584,"STEPPING LEFT, DUCKING RIGHT-- STEPPING RIGHT."
00:52:08.626,00:52:09.668,AND IT WAS PRETTY SPECIFIC.
00:52:09.710,00:52:12.964,"STEPPING LEFT, DUCKING RIGHT."
00:52:16.759,00:52:18.385,Cage: HOLD ON!
00:52:18.427,00:52:19.637,"NOW, REMEMBER: ACROSS THE TRENCH!"
00:52:19.678,00:52:21.305,TWELVE O'CLOCK!
00:52:21.346,00:52:23.933,THEN LOOK TO YOUR RIGHT!
00:52:29.229,00:52:31.189,YOU'RE NOT BEING SPECIFIC.
00:52:31.231,00:52:32.524,I SAID-- YOU NEED TO BE SPECIFIC.
00:52:32.566,00:52:33.818,"UH, OKAY. BUT-- LOOK-- OTHERWISE, I'M DEAD."
00:52:33.859,00:52:36.946,JUST-- RITA.
00:52:36.988,00:52:39.949,CAGE!
00:52:39.991,00:52:41.617,...PACES UP TO THE TOP OF THE TRENCH.
00:52:41.659,00:52:43.243,I'M GONNA STEP LEFT.
00:52:43.285,00:52:55.631,"THERE'S GONNA BE A MIMIC THERE, WHICH I'LL KILL-- ...SHIP EXPLOSION."
00:52:55.673,00:52:57.049,I'M GONNA RUN THIRTY PACES NORTHWEST.
00:52:57.091,00:53:00.469,I'M GONNA DUCK AT THE TOP OF THAT TRENCH AND THEN I'M GONNA TURN LEFT.
00:53:08.019,00:53:11.271,HAVE I GOT SOMETHING ON MY FACE?
00:53:11.313,00:53:14.399,NO.
00:53:21.991,00:53:23.325,Skinner: CAGE!
00:53:23.367,00:53:25.786,WE'VE BEEN LOOKIN' EVERYWHERE FOR YOU.
00:53:25.828,00:53:27.746,CAGE!
00:53:27.788,00:53:30.415,"CAGE, WE'VE BEEN LOOKIN'-- GUYS."
00:53:30.457,00:53:33.961,GUYS. CAN WE...JUST...
00:53:34.003,00:53:35.004,NOT DO THIS TODAY?
00:53:35.046,00:53:36.881,WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?
00:53:36.922,00:53:40.509,FARELL ALMOST STRUNG US UP BY OUR BOLLOCKS FOR LOSING TRACK OF YOU!
00:53:43.054,00:53:44.555,OKAY...SKINNER.
00:53:44.596,00:53:48.266,NOW I'M GONNA CLOSE MY EYES.
00:53:48.308,00:53:49.852,READY?
00:53:54.023,00:53:56.067,STINKING BASTARD.
00:53:56.108,00:53:59.653,I-I DIDN'T MIND THE EXTRA PUSH-UPS.
00:54:06.077,00:54:10.081,Man: COULD ALL COMBAT-READY SQUADRONS PROCEED DIRECTLY TO THE ALLOCATED DROP SHIPS FOR PRIMARY LOADING.
00:54:10.122,00:54:11.916,"Farell: IT'S A NEW DAY, PEOPLE."
00:54:11.957,00:54:13.417,DESTINY CALLS.
00:54:13.458,00:54:17.088,THE WORLD EXPECTS ONLY ONE THING FROM US: THAT WE WILL WIN.
00:54:32.644,00:54:34.270,Woman: ...THE CURRENT SITUATION ON THE FRONT LINE.
00:54:34.312,00:54:37.066,OUR TROOPS HAVE SUFFERED HEAVY CASUALTIES.
00:54:37.108,00:54:40.111,IT'S ABOUT TIME WE SHOWED THOSE THINGS WHAT WE'RE MADE OF.
00:54:40.152,00:54:42.654,MY FATHER FLEW IN THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN.
00:54:42.696,00:54:45.616,THREE YEARS BEFORE THE YANKS CAME INTO THE WAR.
00:54:45.657,00:54:48.202,COULDN'T BE BROKEN.
00:54:48.244,00:54:50.996,Man #2: MY UNCLE GEORGE LANDED ON THE BEACH AT NORMANDY.
00:54:51.038,00:54:52.915,YEAH?
00:54:52.957,00:54:55.459,"IN THEIR DAY, THIS WAR WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER BY NOW."
00:54:55.500,00:54:57.419,"WHAT DO THEY WANT WITH US, ANYWAY?"
00:54:57.461,00:54:59.213,"IT'S OBVIOUS, ISN'T IT?"
00:54:59.255,00:55:01.090,MINERALS?
00:55:01.132,00:55:02.633,"OXYGEN, THEY WANT."
00:55:02.674,00:55:04.593,WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?
00:55:04.635,00:55:06.678,THEY'RE HERE.
00:55:06.720,00:55:10.141,"AND WHATEVER IT IS, THEY'RE GONNA GET IT."
00:55:10.182,00:55:12.476,SHOULDN'T YOU BE OVER THERE?
00:55:12.517,00:55:14.436,I'VE BEEN OVER THERE.
00:55:14.478,00:55:17.273,MORE TIMES THAN ANYBODY.
00:55:17.313,00:55:19.441,"AS A MATTER OF FACT, I'M..."
00:55:19.483,00:55:23.070,USUALLY LONG DEAD BY NOW.
00:55:23.112,00:55:25.572,COWARD!
00:55:27.866,00:55:29.660,WHAT'S GOING ON?
00:55:29.701,00:55:31.703,THE POWER'S GONE.
00:56:39.604,00:56:41.773,Carter: I FOUND THE OMEGA.
00:56:41.815,00:56:44.026,IT HAS TO BE HERE.
00:56:44.068,00:56:45.319,THIS HAS GOT TO BE IT.
00:56:45.361,00:56:46.402,IT FITS THE DESCRIPTION PERFECTLY.
00:56:46.444,00:56:47.196,"YES, YOU FOUND IT."
00:56:47.238,00:56:48.989,AGAIN.
00:56:49.031,00:56:50.699,WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?
00:56:50.741,00:56:52.993,'CAUSE WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET THERE.
00:56:53.035,00:56:55.204,NO MATTER WHAT WE DO...
00:56:55.246,00:57:01.710,"NO MATTER HOW CAREFULLY WE PLAN, WE CAN'T GET OFF THAT BEACH."
00:57:11.845,00:57:14.639,YOU CAN DO THIS.
00:57:14.681,00:57:18.060,YOU KEEP COMING HERE EVERY DAY AND I'LL TRAIN YOU.
00:57:20.187,00:57:22.522,YOU ALREADY HAVE.
00:57:41.792,00:57:43.210,"I'M WAITIN', NANCE!"
00:57:43.252,00:57:45.254,FIVE HUNDRED METERS AND CLOSING FAST!
00:57:45.296,00:57:48.673,WHAT THE--?!
00:57:55.306,00:57:57.766,Woman: RELOAD.
00:58:07.484,00:58:09.945,WHAT'S NEXT?
00:58:12.156,00:58:14.658,STRAIGHT SHOT...
00:58:14.699,00:58:17.244,OKAY.
00:58:17.286,00:58:21.290,"HEY, SARGE, THE NEW GUY, WHAT'S HIS NAME AGAIN?"
00:58:24.460,00:58:28.297,Cage: WE'LL NEED A VEHICLE TO GET FURTHER INLAND.
00:58:28.339,00:58:29.965,Rita: AND WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
00:58:30.007,00:58:31.591,THE PROBLEM IS THE AMBUSH WAITING FOR US DOWN THERE.
00:58:31.633,00:58:33.302,THEY KILL US BEFORE WE FIND A WORKING CAR.
00:58:33.344,00:58:35.179,"OKAY. SO, WHAT'S THE CURRENT PLAN?"
00:58:35.220,00:58:37.181,THE TWO CARS WE HAVEN'T TRIED YET.
00:58:37.222,00:58:38.390,THE MINIVAN...
00:58:38.432,00:58:40.309,...AND THE GREEN S.U.V.
00:58:40.351,00:58:42.769,"SO I'LL HEAD FOR THE S.U.V., DRAW THE MIMICS TO ME."
00:58:42.811,00:58:44.146,YOU GO FOR THE MINIVAN.
00:58:44.188,00:58:46.023,"YOU GET IT STARTED, JUST GO, TAKE OFF."
00:58:46.064,00:58:47.483,DO NOT WAIT FOR ME.
00:58:47.524,00:58:49.318,WHOA-- JUST...
00:58:49.360,00:58:53.113,DON'T FORGET TO DISCONNECT THE CARAVAN BEFORE YOU TAKE OFF.
00:58:53.155,00:58:55.824,YOU ARE GOING TO BE IN A HURRY AND YOU DON'T WANT ANY DEAD WEIGHT.
00:59:20.516,00:59:21.808,COME ON.
00:59:36.156,00:59:37.824,"COME ON, CAGE!"
00:59:37.866,00:59:39.826,Woman: ...ON THE FRONT LINE.
00:59:39.868,00:59:41.786,OUR TROOPS HAVE SUFFERED HEAVY CASUALTIES.
00:59:41.828,00:59:44.081,THE ENEMY HAS BREACHED SECURITY AT DOVER.
00:59:44.122,00:59:45.623,AND ALL ARE ADVISED TO...
00:59:45.665,00:59:47.334,...SEEK SHELTER AS A MATTER OF URGENCY.
00:59:47.376,00:59:49.336,CAN YOU?
00:59:47.376,00:59:54.841,"IN FURTHER UPDATES, MIMICS HAVE NOW BEEN SIGHTED AT PORTSMOUTH, BRIGHTON AND AS FAR INLAND AS HORSHAM."
00:59:54.883,00:59:59.804,THE GOVERNMENT ADVICE AT THIS POINT IS TO STAY WHERE YOU ARE AND REMAIN CALM.
00:59:59.846,01:00:04.684,"IF YOU ARE IN A VEHICLE, PLEASE LOCK DOORS AND STAY INSIDE."
01:00:04.726,01:00:12.734,"WE ARE-- ARE NOW HEARING ACCOUNTS OF MIMIC ATTACKS AT CANTERBURY, FARNHAM, AND-- WE-- WE-- I'M SORRY."
01:00:12.776,01:00:14.694,THE ENEMY HAS REACHED LONDON.
01:00:14.736,01:00:15.695,REPEAT...
01:00:15.737,01:00:18.240,LONDON IS UNDER ATTACK.
01:00:20.784,01:00:23.828,IT'S GOOD DRIVING.
01:00:23.870,01:00:25.330,I FORGOT TO UNHOOK THE TRAILER.
01:00:39.136,01:00:41.346,ENGAGED.
01:01:11.001,01:01:13.670,YOU DON'T TALK MUCH.
01:01:13.711,01:01:15.672,I'M NOT A FAN.
01:01:15.713,01:01:17.132,OF TALKING?
01:01:17.174,01:01:20.218,NOT A FAN OF TALKING.
01:01:20.260,01:01:24.389,YOU KNOW YOU EVENTUALLY DO TALK TO ME.
01:01:24.431,01:01:26.391,IT'S USUALLY AROUND LYONS.
01:01:26.433,01:01:29.269,YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE TIME YOU WENT THERE WITH YOUR FAMILY.
01:01:29.311,01:01:32.523,YOUR BROTHER GOT LOST.
01:01:32.564,01:01:34.899,I'VE NEVER BEEN TO LYONS.
01:01:34.941,01:01:37.944,YOU TELL ME YOUR MIDDLE NAME.
01:01:37.986,01:01:41.281,PEYTON.
01:01:41.323,01:01:43.992,THAT'S NOT MY MIDDLE NAME.
01:01:48.038,01:01:51.791,"YOU FOUND YOUR BROTHER IN THE ARCADE, BY THE WAY."
01:01:51.833,01:01:55.212,"WELL, MAYBE I MADE IT ALL UP JUST TO KEEP YOU QUIET."
01:01:55.253,01:01:56.713,BUT YOU DO TALK TO ME.
01:01:56.754,01:01:59.383,"CAGE, I DO NOT NEED TO GET TO KNOW YOU."
01:01:59.424,01:02:03.011,"AND IF YOU KNEW WHAT WAS GOOD FOR YOU, YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO GET TO KNOW ME EITHER."
01:02:03.053,01:02:05.138,IT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU MAKE IT THROUGH THIS THING.
01:02:05.180,01:02:08.183,WHAT ABOUT HENDRICKS?
01:02:08.225,01:02:10.018,HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT NAME?
01:02:10.060,01:02:11.395,YOU MENTIONED HIM.
01:02:11.436,01:02:12.896,THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
01:02:12.937,01:02:14.814,THEN HOW DO I KNOW HIS NAME?
01:02:14.856,01:02:17.775,WHEN DID I MENTION HIM?
01:02:17.817,01:02:20.362,IS HE WHY YOU WON'T TALK TO ME?
01:02:23.448,01:02:26.951,DON'T EVER MENTION HIS NAME AGAIN.
01:02:26.993,01:02:30.205,WHY? ARE YOU...
01:02:33.250,01:02:38.714,"AND I WATCHED HIM DIE THREE HUNDRED TIMES, AND I REMEMBER..."
01:02:38.755,01:02:40.340,I REMEMBER EVERYTHING.
01:02:40.382,01:02:42.967,SO I DON'T NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT.
01:02:46.680,01:02:48.265,I'M SORRY.
01:02:48.306,01:02:50.434,IT'S JUST WAR.
01:03:53.413,01:03:55.457,THERE'S NOTHING HERE.
01:04:18.605,01:04:20.482,WE HAVE TO FIND THE KEYS.
01:04:20.524,01:04:22.567,LET'S JUST SIPHON THE GAS.
01:04:22.609,01:04:24.986,"OH, WHY DRIVE WHEN WE CAN FLY?"
01:04:25.028,01:04:26.530,IN THAT THING?
01:04:26.571,01:04:30.033,YOU'RE AFRAID OF HEIGHTS.
01:04:30.074,01:04:31.159,I'M AFRAID OF CRASHING.
01:04:31.201,01:04:32.869,AND NOT AT ALL ASHAMED TO ADMIT IT.
01:04:32.910,01:04:35.038,"YOU'LL BE FINE, CAGE."
01:04:35.079,01:04:37.415,WHAT IS IT?
01:04:37.457,01:04:39.334,IT'S NOTHING.
01:04:39.376,01:04:41.461,WHAT IS IT?
01:04:41.503,01:04:42.587,RITA.
01:04:45.465,01:04:48.051,LET ME SEE.
01:05:07.362,01:05:09.823,WE HAVE TO FIND THE KEYS TO THE HELICOPTER.
01:05:09.865,01:05:12.492,I'M SURE THEY'RE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.
01:05:12.534,01:05:14.786,"YOU KNOW THE HELI'S FULL OF FUEL, THOUGH."
01:05:14.828,01:05:17.247,I FOUND A HOSE.
01:05:17.288,01:05:19.082,"WE'RE FLYING, CAGE."
01:05:22.085,01:05:24.880,LET'S JUST SAY WE FIND THE KEYS.
01:05:24.921,01:05:27.424,YOU KNOW?
01:05:27.465,01:05:30.093,WE DON'T HAVE OUR JACKETS OR AMMUNITION.
01:05:30.134,01:05:32.596,IT'S GONNA BE DARK IN A FEW HOURS.
01:05:32.637,01:05:38.560,MIGHT BE BETTER OFF JUST GOING BACK TO THE FARMHOUSE.
01:05:38.602,01:05:40.186,SEEING WHAT WE COULD SALVAGE.
01:05:40.228,01:05:41.938,YOU KNOW?
01:05:41.979,01:05:43.607,COME BACK HERE IN THE MORNING.
01:05:43.648,01:05:47.611,AND CURL UP BY THE FIRE AND OPEN A BOTTLE OF WINE.
01:05:50.864,01:05:52.115,I THINK WE SHOULD JUST RESET.
01:05:52.156,01:05:53.700,WHOA!
01:05:53.742,01:05:56.828,"HEY, JUST-- IF IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU, I'M TIRED."
01:05:56.870,01:05:58.622,I'M IN PAIN.
01:05:58.663,01:06:00.164,I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
01:06:00.206,01:06:02.500,COFFEE'S READY.
01:06:02.542,01:06:03.501,THAT'S PRODUCTIVE.
01:06:03.543,01:06:05.128,TEN MINUTES.
01:06:05.169,01:06:06.546,AND THEN I'M KILLING YOU.
01:06:06.588,01:06:08.632,FINE.
01:06:11.342,01:06:14.137,I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU FOUND COFFEE.
01:06:15.597,01:06:17.641,THANK YOU.
01:06:17.682,01:06:19.935,OH.
01:06:19.976,01:06:21.561,"SUGAR, RIGHT?"
01:06:21.603,01:06:23.647,YEAH.
01:06:28.735,01:06:29.986,THANK YOU.
01:06:30.027,01:06:31.696,"AH, HOLD ON."
01:06:45.669,01:06:48.171,THERE'S A SHIRT OVER THERE.
01:06:55.804,01:06:59.056,Rita: HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE BEEN HERE?
01:07:04.103,01:07:06.063,HOW MANY TIMES?
01:07:06.105,01:07:09.609,WHERE ARE THE KEYS?
01:07:09.651,01:07:11.110,WHERE ARE THE GODDAMN KEYS?
01:07:13.780,01:07:16.240,"YOU CAN FLY IT, CAN'T YOU?"
01:07:16.282,01:07:19.076,"NO. WELL, YES."
01:07:19.118,01:07:21.078,"I'M STILL WORKING ON MY LANDING, SO..."
01:07:21.120,01:07:22.622,WHAT ARE WE STILL DOING HERE?
01:07:22.664,01:07:23.915,YOU'RE WASTING TIME!
01:07:23.957,01:07:25.166,"RITA, IF YOU START THAT ENGINE YOU DIE."
01:07:28.294,01:07:30.505,THIS IS FAR AS YOU GO.
01:07:30.547,01:07:32.799,NO MATTER WHAT I DO...
01:07:32.841,01:07:36.135,THIS IS AS FAR AS YOU EVER MAKE IT.
01:07:43.059,01:07:46.229,THERE'S A MIMIC BURIED TWENTY YARDS AWAY.
01:07:46.270,01:07:49.190,IT ATTACKS WHEN YOU START THE ENGINE.
01:07:49.232,01:07:52.777,"GET YOUR WEAPON AND GET IN THE HELICOPTER, CAGE."
01:07:52.819,01:07:55.906,THERE'S MORE IN THE FIELD BACK THERE.
01:07:57.281,01:07:59.283,ONLY ONE OF US EVER MAKES IT.
01:07:59.325,01:08:00.577,GET IN.
01:08:00.618,01:08:03.454,THE ONLY THING WE HAVEN'T TRIED IS THE VERSION WHERE YOU WALK AWAY.
01:08:03.496,01:08:04.414,THERE'S A CELLAR.
01:08:04.455,01:08:06.165,YOU WAIT THERE TILL I GET BACK.
01:08:06.207,01:08:07.333,YOU'LL BE SAFE.
01:08:07.375,01:08:09.419,I'M A SOLDIER.
01:08:09.460,01:08:10.837,I'M NOT WALKING AWAY.
01:08:10.879,01:08:12.171,YOU DIE HERE.
01:08:12.213,01:08:13.339,RIGHT HERE.
01:08:13.381,01:08:17.260,I...CAN'T SAVE YOU.
01:08:17.301,01:08:20.513,"AND IF I GO ON AND KILL THE OMEGA, YOU'RE DEAD."
01:08:20.555,01:08:22.181,FOREVER.
01:08:22.223,01:08:25.643,WHY DOES IT MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TO ME?
01:08:25.685,01:08:29.564,I WISH...
01:08:29.606,01:08:33.026,I DIDN'T KNOW YOU...
01:08:33.068,01:08:36.362,BUT I DO.
01:10:05.576,01:10:08.496,MY MIDDLE NAME...
01:10:08.538,01:10:10.581,IS ROSE.
01:10:30.018,01:10:32.395,"Sergeant: ON YOUR FEET, MAGGOT!"
01:10:43.198,01:10:45.449,"Farell: THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE'S HOPE FOR YOU, PRIVATE."
01:10:45.491,01:10:48.078,HOPE IN THE FORM OF GLORIOUS COMBAT.
01:10:48.119,01:10:54.084,"BATTLE IS THE GREAT REDEEMER, THE FIERY CRUCIBLE IN WHICH THE ONLY TRUE HEROES ARE FORGED."
01:10:54.125,01:10:56.335,THE ONE PLACE WHERE ALL MEN...
01:11:04.928,01:11:06.846,YES?
01:11:06.888,01:11:10.183,WHO SAID YOU COULD TALK TO ME?
01:11:13.352,01:11:16.480,"HAVE I GOT SOMETHING ON MY FACE, SOLDIER?"
01:11:16.522,01:11:21.152,"I'M SORRY TO DISTURB YOU, SERGEANT."
01:11:43.049,01:11:44.634,"ALL RIGHT, MAN, LET'S GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD."
01:11:44.675,01:11:45.509,I GOTTA SUIT UP.
01:11:46.970,01:11:48.304,"Skinner: COME ON, KIMMEL, LET'S HAVE IT!"
01:11:48.345,01:11:49.346,WHERE'S YOUR HELMET?
01:11:49.388,01:11:52.349,NEVER WEAR ONE.
01:11:52.391,01:11:54.518,IT'S A DISTRACTION.
01:11:54.560,01:11:58.022,HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING?
01:11:58.064,01:12:03.527,"I NEED THREE MORE CLIPS OF FIVE-FIVE-SIX, EIGHT GRENADES AND AN EXTRA BATTERY."
01:12:06.948,01:12:08.032,GET IT.
01:12:14.705,01:12:16.332,Skinner: 'EY!
01:12:16.373,01:12:18.042,"OI, MATE!"
01:12:18.084,01:12:19.919,I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR SUIT.
01:12:19.961,01:12:23.380,THERE'S A DEAD GUY IN IT.
01:12:23.422,01:12:26.509,WOO-HOO!
01:12:26.550,01:12:28.136,"THANK GOD, WE MADE IT!"
01:12:28.178,01:12:29.762,WHOO--!
01:14:29.757,01:14:34.011,FINISH IT!
01:15:26.314,01:15:29.192,IT ISN'T THERE.
01:15:29.233,01:15:31.110,WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE OMEGA ISN'T THERE?
01:15:31.152,01:15:32.945,MY GUESS IS IT NEVER WAS.
01:15:32.987,01:15:33.779,THEY AMBUSHED US.
01:15:33.821,01:15:35.281,THE VISIONS WERE A TRAP.
01:15:35.323,01:15:39.285,JUST LIKE RITA'S VISIONS WERE A TRAP AT VERDUN.
01:15:39.327,01:15:42.288,IT COULD HAVE KILLED ME BUT IT DIDN'T.
01:15:42.330,01:15:43.331,IT'S AFTER MY BLOOD.
01:15:43.373,01:15:45.375,SO THEY KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
01:15:45.416,01:15:48.336,THEY-- THEY WANT THEIR POWER BACK.
01:15:48.378,01:15:50.338,AND THEY'RE GONNA GET IT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
01:15:50.380,01:15:51.839,UNLESS WE FIND THE OMEGA.
01:15:51.881,01:15:54.258,THE-- THERE ISN'T ANY OTHER WAY.
01:15:54.300,01:15:55.926,NO.
01:15:55.968,01:15:57.678,THAT DOESN'T WORK.
01:15:57.720,01:16:01.516,"YOU BUILT A PROTOTYPE AT WHITEHALL-- YES, AND I GOT FIRED FOR IT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH."
01:16:01.557,01:16:02.766,"WH-WHAT IS THIS THING, ANYWAY?"
01:16:02.808,01:16:03.851,IT'S A TRANSPONDER.
01:16:03.893,01:16:08.439,"YOU STICK IT INTO THE ALPHA, AND IT TAPS INTO THE WAVELENGTH CONNECTING IT TO THE OMEGA."
01:16:08.481,01:16:09.690,"THAT'S THE IDEA, ANYWAY."
01:16:09.732,01:16:11.275,BUT I CAN'T GET IT TO WORK.
01:16:11.317,01:16:13.319,NOT WITH THE EQUIPMENT I HAVE ON HAND.
01:16:13.361,01:16:16.197,HOW DO WE GET YOU WHAT YOU NEED?
01:16:16.239,01:16:17.614,"WELL, THAT'S THE THING."
01:16:17.656,01:16:19.409,"I MEAN, WHEN I WAS AT WHITEHALL I BUILT ONE."
01:16:19.450,01:16:20.701,I WAS EVEN READY TO TEST IT.
01:16:20.743,01:16:22.370,WHEN I TOLD MY SUPERIORS ABOUT IT...
01:16:22.412,01:16:23.287,"WELL, I LOST MY JOB."
01:16:23.329,01:16:24.788,THEY THOUGHT HE WAS CRAZY.
01:16:24.830,01:16:26.874,SO ALL WE NEED TO DO IS GO TO WHITEHALL.
01:16:26.916,01:16:29.793,YOU'D BE ARRESTED TEN FEET FROM THE FRONT DOOR.
01:16:29.835,01:16:31.379,PSYCH WARD. DISSECTION.
01:16:31.421,01:16:34.715,"HEY, HEY, HEY!"
01:16:34.757,01:16:37.134,THE TRANSPONDER REQUIRES A LIVE ALPHA TO MAKE IT WORK.
01:16:37.176,01:16:41.389,WE DON'T NEED ONE.
01:16:43.474,01:16:45.809,WHEN THE CHINESE DELEGATION COMES OUT...
01:16:45.851,01:16:47.895,WE PICK UP THE PACE.
01:16:47.937,01:16:51.732,THIS GUY WITH THE YELLOW ARMBAND ALWAYS RECOGNIZES YOU...
01:16:51.774,01:16:55.361,SO JUST KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN AND STAY TO MY RIGHT.
01:17:01.242,01:17:04.328,NICELY DONE.
01:17:05.413,01:17:07.498,"THREE, TWO, ONE."
01:17:07.540,01:17:08.541,GO.
01:17:08.583,01:17:09.417,ONE...
01:17:11.877,01:17:13.670,"SIX, SEVEN..."
01:17:13.712,01:17:15.256,EIGHT...
01:17:21.804,01:17:23.764,"AND, TURN."
01:17:23.806,01:17:26.850,OKAY. KEEP WALKING.
01:17:28.102,01:17:29.728,Man: ROBINSON.
01:17:29.770,01:17:31.606,I'VE ASKED NOT TO BE DISTURBED.
01:17:31.647,01:17:33.316,THIS HAD BETTER BE CRITICAL.
01:17:33.357,01:17:34.691,Cage: THE FATE OF MANKIND.
01:17:34.733,01:17:35.943,CRITICAL ENOUGH?
01:17:35.985,01:17:37.945,I DON'T BELIEVE WHAT I'M SEEING.
01:17:37.987,01:17:40.448,I'VE HAD MORE THAN MY SHARE OF THAT.
01:17:40.490,01:17:43.409,"Rita: SIT DOWN, GENERAL."
01:17:43.451,01:17:45.953,I'D TAKE HER VERY SERIOUSLY IF I WERE YOU.
01:17:45.995,01:17:49.165,"HAVE TO HAND IT TO YOU, MAJOR."
01:17:49.206,01:17:55.296,"WHEN YOU LEFT THIS OFFICE TODAY, I NEVER IMAGINED YOU'D BE BACK, LET ALONE WITH MY MOST DECORATED SOLDIER."
01:17:55.338,01:17:56.755,"I'M GONNA TELL YA A STORY, GENERAL."
01:17:56.797,01:18:00.468,"AND, AT FIRST, IT'S GONNA SOUND RIDICULOUS, BUT THE LONGER I TALK, THE MORE RATIONAL IT'S GOING TO APPEAR."
01:18:00.510,01:18:01.927,TELL HIM YOU'LL CALL BACK.
01:18:01.969,01:18:03.720,TELL WHO?
01:18:03.762,01:18:05.473,"MAJOR GENERAL BEAUMONT, CALLING FROM HALIFAX."
01:18:05.515,01:18:07.224,HIS PLANE HAS JUST BEEN DELAYED.
01:18:07.266,01:18:08.892,YES.
01:18:11.521,01:18:14.398,"THANK YOU, BEAUMONT."
01:18:16.317,01:18:18.152,TOMORROW'S INVASION IS A SLAUGHTER.
01:18:18.194,01:18:23.240,"I'M DEAD WITHIN FIVE MINUTES OF LANDING ON THAT BEACH, ALONG WITH EVERY OTHER SOLDIER YOU ARE SENDING."
01:18:23.282,01:18:25.660,AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE ENEMY KNOWS WE'RE COMING.
01:18:25.701,01:18:27.495,HOW DO I KNOW THIS?
01:18:25.701,01:18:29.830,"BEFORE I DIED, I KILLED A MIMIC, ONLY THIS ONE WAS DIFFERENT."
01:18:29.872,01:18:32.082,IT PASSED SOMETHING ON TO ME.
01:18:32.124,01:18:34.418,NOW I LIVE THE SAME DAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
01:18:34.460,01:18:35.461,JUST LIKE THEY DO.
01:18:35.503,01:18:37.004,JUST LIKE SERGEANT VRATASKI...
01:18:37.046,01:18:38.506,AT VERDUN.
01:18:38.548,01:18:41.008,TELL YOUR SECRETARY EVERYTHING'S FINE.
01:18:41.050,01:18:42.385,BEG YOUR PARDON?
01:18:45.054,01:18:47.348,"UM, I'M...SORRY, GENERAL."
01:18:47.390,01:18:49.016,IT'S FINE.
01:18:49.058,01:18:51.060,SHE TYPED UP THOSE ORDERS FOR YOU TO AUTHORIZE.
01:18:51.101,01:18:55.939,BUT SHE LEFT OUT THE ONES REFERRING TO THE FUEL DUMP AT GREENWICH.
01:18:55.981,01:18:57.525,YOUR NAME IS IRIS.
01:18:57.567,01:19:00.069,YOUR BIRTHDAY IS SEPTEMBER SEVENTEENTH.
01:19:00.110,01:19:04.781,"THE GENERAL QUIETLY PULLED SOME STRINGS, STATIONED YOUR ONLY SON IN AUSTRALIA, AS FAR FROM THE WAR AS POSSIBLE."
01:19:04.823,01:19:07.201,TELL THE GENERAL HIS DINNER'S JUST BEEN CANCELED.
01:19:07.243,01:19:08.494,THE CALL CAME IN JUST NOW.
01:19:08.536,01:19:11.955,YOUR DINNER WAS CANCELED.
01:19:11.997,01:19:14.584,YOU FORGOT THE FUEL DUMP.
01:19:14.625,01:19:17.294,"THANK YOU, IRIS."
01:19:25.135,01:19:26.303,"CAGE, LET'S GO."
01:19:26.345,01:19:27.513,RITA.
01:19:27.555,01:19:28.764,LET ME JUST-- WHAT ARE WE DOING?
01:19:28.805,01:19:31.601,"PLEASE, DON'T SHOOT HIM AGAIN. OKAY?"
01:19:31.642,01:19:40.693,"JUST -- JUST-- GENERAL, THI-- THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION, OKAY?"
01:19:40.735,01:19:43.112,THAT'S-THAT'S- BECAUSE YOU'RE-YOU'RE STUBBORN.
01:19:43.153,01:19:47.199,YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YA THAT DR. CARTER WAS RIGHT.
01:19:47.241,01:19:49.493,THAT THE ENEMY CAN MANIPULATE TIME.
01:19:49.535,01:19:50.953,THE INVASION WILL FAIL.
01:19:50.994,01:19:53.581,NO MATTER HOW MANY BODIES YOU THROW AT IT.
01:19:53.623,01:20:00.129,THE ONLY WAY TO WIN THIS WAR IS BY FINDING THIS POWER SOURCE OF THE MIMIC HORDE AND KILLING IT.
01:20:00.170,01:20:03.549,AND THE ONLY MEANS OF FINDING IT IS IN THAT SAFE RIGHT THERE.
01:20:06.176,01:20:08.053,NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION...
01:20:08.095,01:20:13.225,YOU REFUSE TO ACCEPT THAT THE ENEMY BREAKS THROUGH TO LONDON TOMORROW AND WE LOSE.
01:20:13.267,01:20:15.936,WE LOSE EVERYTHING.
01:20:21.233,01:20:23.444,LET'S SAY FOR ONE MOMENT...
01:20:23.486,01:20:26.405,THAT I CAN'T RATIONALLY EXPLAIN...
01:20:26.447,01:20:29.575,YOUR IMPRESSIVE PARLOR TRICKS.
01:20:31.702,01:20:34.371,DR. CARTER TOLD ME...
01:20:34.413,01:20:36.999,THIS DEVICE REQUIRES A LIVE MIMIC TO WORK.
01:20:37.040,01:20:38.417,WHAT USE IS IT TO YOU?
01:20:38.459,01:20:40.919,THAT'S MY CONCERN.
01:20:40.961,01:20:42.421,ON THE CONTRARY.
01:20:42.463,01:20:44.173,"ACCORDING TO YOU, THIS CONCERNS THE WHOLE WORLD."
01:20:44.214,01:20:48.051,"WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU BELIEVED EVERYTHING I JUST TOLD YOU?"
01:20:48.093,01:20:50.596,I WOULD LOCATE THIS...
01:20:50.638,01:20:52.889,OMEGA.
01:20:52.931,01:20:55.142,YOU'RE NOT MENTALLY EQUIPPED TO FIGHT THIS THING.
01:20:55.184,01:20:56.893,AND YOU NEVER WILL BE.
01:21:12.702,01:21:15.412,WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
01:21:15.454,01:21:18.582,I DON'T KNOW.
01:21:24.921,01:21:25.798,THAT WAS EASY.
01:21:25.840,01:21:26.757,NOW!
01:21:26.799,01:21:28.592,STOP RIGHT THERE!
01:21:28.634,01:21:30.219,NOBODY MOVE!
01:21:30.260,01:21:32.221,WEAPON!
01:21:34.097,01:21:35.224,Man: STOP!
01:21:39.269,01:21:40.896,THEY'RE OFF AND AWAY!
01:21:40.937,01:21:42.314,WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS?
01:21:42.356,01:21:44.775,STICK IT IN YOUR LEG.
01:22:02.585,01:22:05.003,"CAGE, WHAT'S HAPPENING?"
01:22:05.045,01:22:07.005,TALK TO ME.
01:22:07.047,01:22:09.925,I FEEL IT.
01:22:09.966,01:22:13.011,WHAT DO YOU SEE?
01:22:13.053,01:22:14.930,IT'S-IT'S THE LOUVRE.
01:22:14.971,01:22:16.390,WHERE?
01:22:16.432,01:22:19.602,I'M INSIDE NOW.
01:22:19.643,01:22:21.812,NOW I'M GOING DOWN.
01:22:21.854,01:22:23.355,A GARAGE UNDERNEATH THE MUSEUM.
01:22:23.397,01:22:25.858,THE OMEGA.
01:22:31.988,01:22:32.989,IT'S IN PARIS.
01:22:50.841,01:22:52.802,RITA!
01:22:59.349,01:23:01.143,Man: TURN YOUR HEAD!
01:23:01.184,01:23:03.813,STAY IN THE CAR!
01:23:03.854,01:23:06.774,MOVE AWAY FROM THE CAR!
01:23:32.675,01:23:35.135,WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
01:23:35.177,01:23:37.304,WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
01:23:38.722,01:23:43.226,YOU'LL BE FINE.
01:23:43.268,01:23:44.895,YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'VE JUST DONE.
01:23:44.937,01:23:46.104,I'M NOT ALLOWED TO TALK TO YOU.
01:23:46.146,01:23:48.190,I WAS WITH SOMEONE.
01:23:48.231,01:23:51.360,RITA VRATASKI.
01:23:51.401,01:23:53.153,RITA VRATASKI.
01:23:53.195,01:23:55.113,PLEASE.
01:23:55.155,01:23:57.115,JUST TELL ME THAT.
01:23:58.993,01:24:01.036,PLEASE TELL ME.
01:24:01.077,01:24:02.830,I'M SORRY.
01:24:39.783,01:24:42.244,"I WAS OUT OF THOSE THINGS IN THREE MINUTES FLAT, CAGE."
01:24:42.285,01:24:43.328,WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
01:24:44.496,01:24:46.623,I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD.
01:24:46.665,01:24:48.375,NOT YET.
01:24:53.463,01:24:55.298,"SORRY, CAGE."
01:24:55.340,01:24:57.133,WAIT! WAIT!
01:24:57.175,01:24:59.929,THEY GAVE ME BLOOD.
01:25:01.972,01:25:04.934,I LOST THE POWER.
01:25:04.975,01:25:07.644,I FEEL IT.
01:25:07.686,01:25:11.314,I CAN'T RESET THE DAY ANYMORE.
01:25:17.279,01:25:20.741,Woman: BE ADVISED: HANGER F-NINE IS OUT OF BOUNDS UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.
01:25:24.494,01:25:27.122,WE HAVE TO KILL THE OMEGA...
01:25:27.163,01:25:29.458,BEFORE THE INVASION STARTS.
01:25:29.499,01:25:32.127,THAT GIVES US LESS THAN THREE HOURS.
01:25:32.168,01:25:35.839,WE NEED A DROP SHIP TO GET TO PARIS IN TIME.
01:25:35.881,01:25:37.800,NEED MORE SOLDIERS TOO.
01:25:37.841,01:25:40.761,NOW WHO'S CRAZY ENOUGH TO FOLLOW US TO PARIS?
01:25:47.517,01:25:48.477,CAGE!
01:25:48.518,01:25:49.853,CAGE!
01:25:49.895,01:25:52.355,WE'VE BEEN LOOKIN' EVERYWHERE FOR YOU.
01:25:52.397,01:25:54.483,JUST...LISTEN.
01:25:52.397,01:25:55.901,FARELL ALMOST STRUNG US UP BY OUR BOLLOCKS FOR LOSING TRACK OF YOU!
01:25:55.943,01:25:57.319,I KNOW. I KNOW.
01:25:57.360,01:25:58.695,YOU'RE GONNA WANNA HEAR THIS STORY.
01:25:58.737,01:26:03.492,"NOW, IT'S GONNA SOUND RIDICULOUS AT FIRST, BUT THE LONGER I TALK, THE MORE RATIONAL IT'S GOING TO APPEAR."
01:26:03.533,01:26:04.701,YEAH?
01:26:04.743,01:26:06.620,HE NAMED THE SCHOOL I WENT TO.
01:26:06.662,01:26:09.706,AND THEN HE TELLS ME MY SECOND GRADE TEACHER...
01:26:09.748,01:26:11.333,WAS CALLED MISS POLIO.
01:26:11.374,01:26:14.003,"SHE WOULDN'T LET HIM GO TO THE BATHROOM, MADE HIM WET HIS PANTS."
01:26:14.044,01:26:15.211,SHUT UP.
01:26:15.253,01:26:18.007,"LOOK, I AM TELLING YOU, MAN."
01:26:18.048,01:26:19.883,HE KNOWS EVERYTHING.
01:26:19.925,01:26:21.010,ABOUT ALL OF US.
01:26:21.051,01:26:23.012,BULLSHIT.
01:26:23.053,01:26:25.722,HE SAYS YOUR NAME AIN'T REALLY FORD.
01:26:25.764,01:26:28.017,SAYS FORD WAS YOUR FRIEND.
01:26:28.058,01:26:31.020,DIED IN COMBAT ON HIS FIRST DAY.
01:26:31.061,01:26:32.980,YOU TOOK HIS PLACE.
01:26:33.022,01:26:35.649,Nance: YOU SLIPPERY BITCH.
01:26:35.691,01:26:37.776,Skinner: CAGE SAYS THE ENEMY KNOWS US TOO.
01:26:37.818,01:26:38.986,THEY'RE WAITIN' FOR US ON THE BEACH.
01:26:39.028,01:26:40.529,AND WE ALL DIE.
01:26:40.570,01:26:42.572,THE WHOLE INVASION IS A SLAUGHTER.
01:26:42.614,01:26:44.074,"WELL, THIS IS GREAT."
01:26:44.116,01:26:46.409,REALLY GOOD CONFIDENCE BOOSTER FOR TOMORROW.
01:26:46.451,01:26:47.577,"THANKS, CAGE."
01:26:47.619,01:26:49.204,"BUT WE CAN CHANGE IT, RIGHT?"
01:26:49.245,01:26:51.498,"I MEAN, THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHIN' THAT WE CAN DO."
01:26:51.540,01:26:53.792,THERE HAS TO BE...
01:26:53.834,01:26:56.378,THERE IS A CHANCE.
01:26:56.419,01:26:58.088,IT'S A SLIM ONE.
01:26:58.130,01:27:02.342,BUT IT MEANS COMING WITH ME...RIGHT NOW.
01:27:02.384,01:27:03.844,"Griff: LISTEN, PAL."
01:27:03.886,01:27:06.346,I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT US.
01:27:06.388,01:27:08.390,WE JUST MET YOU.
01:27:08.431,01:27:10.017,COME ON.
01:27:10.059,01:27:12.519,WHY WOULD WE FOLLOW HIM INTO COMBAT?

01:28:49.741,01:28:52.869,WE'LL NEVER EVEN REMEMBER WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION.
01:28:52.911,01:28:53.996,AND THEY'RE GONNA KNOW WE'RE COMING.

01:32:39.346,01:32:40.722,"FORD, YOU'RE OUT."
01:32:40.763,01:32:44.100,GRIFF HAS ONLY GOT HALF A MAGAZINE LEFT AND HE CAN HARDLY MOVE.
01:32:44.142,01:32:46.144,I THOUGHT YOU COULD SEE THE FUTURE.
01:32:46.186,01:32:48.021,I HAVEN'T LIVED THIS DAY.
01:32:48.063,01:32:50.648,I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
01:32:50.690,01:32:52.192,Rita: IT DOESN'T MATTER.
01:32:52.234,01:32:53.943,WHAT MATTERS IS WE FINISH THIS.

01:39:16.826,01:39:20.371,NEITHER ONE OF US IS GETTING OUT OF HERE.
01:39:42.769,01:39:47.732,THANK YOU...FOR GETTING ME THIS FAR.
01:39:51.611,01:39:54.656,"YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, CAGE."
01:39:54.697,01:39:58.534,I WISH I HAD THE CHANCE TO KNOW YOU BETTER.

01:43:50.850,01:43:55.063,A LARGE SURGE OF ENERGY WAS DETECTED IN PARIS.
01:43:55.104,01:43:57.815,WE DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THIS SIGNIFIES.
01:43:57.857,01:44:02.945,BUT THE RESULT APPEARS TO BE A TOTAL COLLAPSE OF THE ENEMY'S CAPACITY TO FIGHT.
01:44:02.987,01:44:10.078,RUSSIAN AND CHINESE TROOPS ARE NOW MOVING ACROSS EUROPE WITHOUT RESISTANCE.
01:44:10.119,01:44:13.081,"TOMORROW, WE ADVANCE ON THE WESTERN FRONT."
