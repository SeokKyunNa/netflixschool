00:01:17.452,00:01:19.704,"Hello, we're BLACKPINK!"
00:01:53.196,00:01:55.031,"Congratulations, BLACKPINK."
00:01:55.115,00:01:56.533,Congratulations to BLACKPINK!
00:02:31.568,00:02:33.111,You guys don't like Injeolmi?
00:02:59.137,00:03:08.479,Seeing so many people love our music motivates us to try something new and different.
00:03:50.980,00:03:53.024,Why is the delay so bad right now?
00:03:53.107,00:03:54.525,Can you bring it down a bit?
00:03:54.609,00:03:56.361,Push it forward a bit.
00:04:25.682,00:04:27.558,Hello!
00:04:29.519,00:04:33.273,"Oppa, you’ve got some leather jackets going on over there? Cool!"
00:04:39.821,00:04:41.823,I should’ve taken a nap.
00:04:43.241,00:04:45.618,-I'll slap your wrist to wake you up. -But I didn't.
00:04:46.828,00:04:47.662,Better?
00:06:00.443,00:06:01.569,It's addictive.
00:06:05.281,00:06:08.368,Should we re-record certain parts of Crazy Over You?
00:06:26.219,00:06:28.763,Who thinks you can nail your part in this song?
00:07:31.701,00:07:32.827,"Oh, that scared me."
00:08:53.199,00:08:56.994,This is a trio named Seo Taiji and Boys.
00:08:57.078,00:08:58.788,Please give them applause!
00:09:06.837,00:09:11.384,Powerful rhythm and flash dances are the hallmarks of Seo Taiji's music.
00:09:11.467,00:09:14.262,"They sing well, look cool, and dance well."
00:09:17.974,00:09:21.978,The interest in Korean pop music is unusually high overseas.
00:10:16.407,00:10:18.075,How many do I have to try?
00:10:35.926,00:10:37.928,You look naturally sexy!
00:10:38.012,00:10:40.181,-Really! -You can't help yourself!
00:10:40.264,00:10:47.021,"If we wear something, we all try to see how it fits as a group, but that's-- Well, it's case by case."
00:10:48.230,00:10:51.651,But shouldn’t we make it a bit tighter? What do you think?
00:10:51.734,00:10:55.446,Because this side needs to be pulled up.
00:11:05.831,00:11:08.709,Lisa has diverse tastes.
00:11:54.088,00:11:56.215,-What's this? -Coachella.
00:11:58.884,00:12:01.095,I missed my note at the eh.
00:12:01.178,00:12:03.556,"See, this is why we can't enjoy our footage."
00:12:03.639,00:12:12.982,"We're like, You missed your note at the 'eh' and “when you were dancing, you should have done this, -but you did it too quickly.” -I missed my note “-eh.” That wasn’t good."
00:12:16.527,00:12:18.738,We were so nervous.
00:12:26.662,00:12:31.500,"Compared to other stages, it was much more overwhelming because we were so nervous."
00:12:31.584,00:12:38.174,"For us, it was our first time performing in this unfamiliar place called America."
00:12:38.257,00:12:41.844,I used to dream of that day when we were trainees.
00:13:16.128,00:13:17.922,Jennie's personality?
00:13:18.672,00:13:26.138,"At first, it was hard getting to know her, but once we got close, I could tell that she's very loyal, very sweet, and a lovely friend."
00:13:30.976,00:13:35.648,"I see her every day, so I'm used to her, and she's like my little sister."
00:13:35.731,00:13:42.279,"But when I see her on TV, I'm like, Ah, Jennie is a star,” but she's really down-to-earth."
00:13:42.363,00:13:45.324,You're doing so well.
00:13:50.412,00:13:52.790,Slowly.
00:13:54.333,00:13:56.460,Lift one leg up and do an arabesque.
00:15:32.181,00:15:37.478,I understand English better than when I began.
00:15:37.561,00:15:44.568,"In the beginning, my friends helped me a lot and showed me their notes."
00:15:44.652,00:15:46.570,Now I can do it by myself.
00:16:21.605,00:16:22.690,Good work.
00:17:18.328,00:17:19.747,So pretty!
00:17:28.005,00:17:29.757,"Oh, that’s really long ago."
00:17:31.008,00:17:33.677,I used to sing a lot of dark and heavy songs.
00:17:34.678,00:17:38.432,"So I often wonder a lot these days, What am I doing right now?"
00:17:39.099,00:17:41.018,It's so different now.
00:17:46.023,00:17:48.609,- You're sexy. - You're always so cool.
00:18:01.663,00:18:05.959,"Wow, there are people born to do this."
00:18:25.813,00:18:31.735,My role is a rapper and also the lead dancer.
00:18:36.782,00:18:38.367,Hello.
00:18:43.664,00:18:47.000,I love vintage clothes.
00:18:47.084,00:18:52.464,"So wherever I go, whether in America or anywhere else, I try to look for vintage shops."
00:18:57.344,00:18:59.179,This is 1.1 million won.
00:19:00.556,00:19:03.016,"-And this is 320,000 won. -And this one?"
00:19:03.100,00:19:04.685,"That's 750,000 won."
00:19:04.768,00:19:06.520,This is 1.1 million won?
00:19:06.603,00:19:08.564,"Yes, because it's from the early '90s."
00:19:18.031,00:19:20.701,My mom manages my finances.
00:19:39.803,00:19:42.598,I was born in Thailand.
00:19:44.975,00:19:48.020,I was born in Buriram Province.
00:19:49.521,00:19:53.150,Then I moved to Bangkok when I was three.
00:19:54.234,00:20:04.161,"My auntie had a music group, so they had mic stands, and I always played with them."
00:20:04.244,00:20:07.831,I would lower it until it was the same height as me.
00:20:07.915,00:20:10.417,Then I would just dance and sing to myself.
00:20:10.500,00:20:12.961,That was how my mom knew I loved dancing.
00:20:13.712,00:20:17.424,So she signed me up for a course when I was in kindergarten.
00:20:20.677,00:20:23.180,That was how it all began.
00:20:27.434,00:20:29.895,She signed me up for many contests.
00:20:32.397,00:20:36.068,How long have you been practicing break dancing?
00:20:36.151,00:20:37.653,For a long time.
00:20:37.736,00:20:41.740,I participated in a contest. I was around 12 or 13 years old then.
00:20:41.823,00:20:47.329,Then a talent scout told me to try singing and asked if I wanted to be a singer.
00:20:47.412,00:20:51.959,Then I realized that I loved both singing and dancing.
00:20:52.668,00:20:56.129,And YG happened to have an audition at the time.
00:20:56.213,00:20:57.506,"So, I made a decision."
00:21:02.344,00:21:04.179,Was this an audition?
00:21:04.263,00:21:05.764,How many layers are you wearing?
00:21:05.847,00:21:07.766,Why did you wear pants on top of pants?
00:21:07.849,00:21:10.143,What is this?
00:21:10.227,00:21:12.688,"-Oh, my God. -This is amazing."
00:21:12.771,00:21:13.605,What is this?
00:21:13.689,00:21:14.773,You looked so cool.
00:21:14.856,00:21:16.692,I was trying so hard to be cool.
00:21:17.442,00:21:21.071,"After the audition ended, I waited for the call."
00:21:21.154,00:21:23.115,I was waiting and waiting.
00:21:23.198,00:21:24.908,I waited for the call.
00:21:24.992,00:21:29.204,I waited for two months!
00:21:29.788,00:21:34.084,"And then they called me. So I was like, What? Is this possible?"
00:21:40.215,00:21:43.260,I was a mama's girl.
00:21:43.343,00:21:49.516,"So, when I had to go to Korea without Mom, I felt that I had to take care of myself now."
00:21:56.815,00:22:00.027,I didn't speak any Korean.
00:22:00.110,00:22:06.325,"I only knew how to say hello, so it really was a new start."
00:22:11.455,00:22:14.791,"Fortunately, there was Jennie."
00:22:18.462,00:22:22.674,She was the only one who could speak English among the trainees.
00:22:23.216,00:22:25.093,I spoke English with her.
00:22:28.013,00:22:31.058,"If something were to happen, I would talk to her."
00:22:33.643,00:22:35.812,That's it.
00:22:38.273,00:22:41.568,You choose how to sing it because we're all doing it differently.
00:22:47.824,00:22:57.459,A great thing with us is that everyone wants the best for the group as a whole.
00:23:02.214,00:23:03.382,Okay.
00:23:03.465,00:23:10.222,"Since we perform as a group, we try to strike a balance that works for everyone."
00:23:11.223,00:23:12.808,"That’s our best quality, I think."
00:23:35.747,00:23:37.290,"Sit here, Jisoo."
00:23:37.999,00:23:39.418,What do you think?
00:23:39.501,00:23:41.711,Do you think I'll be able to learn today?
00:23:43.338,00:23:47.467,I think it’ll be nice to learn how to draw my eyebrows properly.
00:23:47.551,00:23:49.970,"If you show me, I'll do it the same."
00:23:50.053,00:23:52.431,-Okay. -I'm learning from you today.
00:23:52.514,00:23:54.391,Do you teach makeup like this too?
00:23:54.474,00:23:56.184,-To regular people? Yes. -Really?
00:23:56.685,00:23:58.186,-There are classes? -Of course!
00:23:58.270,00:24:00.313,I should've taken those classes then.
00:24:00.397,00:24:02.524,People come to learn BLACKPINK makeup.
00:24:02.607,00:24:03.984,-BLACKPINK makeup? -Yes.
00:24:04.067,00:24:09.573,"When I was younger, my relatives treated me like an outcast because I was ugly."
00:24:10.157,00:24:10.991,What?
00:24:11.074,00:24:12.909,They called me a monkey.
00:24:12.993,00:24:15.370,It's okay. You're the prettiest one now.
00:24:17.706,00:24:22.210,"I grew up in Sanbon in Gunpo city, Gyeonggi-do region."
00:24:22.794,00:24:28.383,"I lived with my parents, my sister, my brother, and my grandparents."
00:24:29.384,00:24:36.850,I'm living a very different life than the one I thought I'd be living.
00:24:38.310,00:24:42.397,I used to want to be a writer or a painter.
00:24:43.398,00:24:45.192,I couldn’t paint well though.
00:24:46.526,00:24:49.196,Then I joined the drama club in 11th grade.
00:24:49.863,00:24:52.199,"I thought, should I try acting?"
00:24:52.282,00:24:56.578,"They said I should start auditioning for stuff, because I needed the experience."
00:24:58.288,00:25:00.165,My first audition was at YG.
00:25:01.416,00:25:08.131,I didn't know much about YG at all before I arrived there the first day.
00:25:09.216,00:25:12.552,It felt like something unreachable for me.
00:25:13.595,00:25:18.642,I never thought I'd actually be doing it for real.
00:25:19.684,00:25:22.062,Do you think I really lost my baby fat?
00:25:22.145,00:25:28.985,"Back then, it was more baby-like here… I'll just have to eat ramen before I sleep tonight."
00:25:29.069,00:25:30.695,Then you'll get your old self back.
00:25:30.779,00:25:32.656,"No, you're perfect right now."
00:25:32.739,00:25:34.741,You were like a baby back then.
00:25:35.575,00:25:39.371,"But you're different from back then, too."
00:25:39.454,00:25:41.206,You have your own shop!
00:25:41.289,00:25:43.208,Who told you to open your own shop?
00:25:43.291,00:25:44.918,Say it! Who told you to?
00:25:45.001,00:25:45.835,You did.
00:25:48.171,00:25:49.130,It was my big plan.
00:25:50.590,00:25:52.384,And I'm still planning big things.
00:25:53.552,00:26:01.059,"I think that those who think, This is what I have to do. This is my path, are truly lucky."
00:26:01.977,00:26:04.104,I don't think there are many like that.
00:30:10.725,00:30:17.273,"She brought a guitar from Australia, and I was like, Play something for us."
00:30:34.165,00:30:36.584,It's really pretty.
00:30:36.668,00:30:38.711,"Here, stand here."
00:30:47.929,00:30:56.855,"After my Korean classes on the fifth floor, I took the elevators to the basement."
00:30:56.938,00:31:01.067,"And there was this girl with short hair, tied back."
00:31:01.150,00:31:04.487,It was kind of awkward.
00:31:04.571,00:31:07.907,-I was nervous. -I'm sure you were nervous.
00:31:07.991,00:31:10.827,"I was like, Oh! A new girl?"
00:31:10.910,00:31:13.538,I was so wary of... competition?
00:31:13.621,00:31:16.165,"-Competition. -Competition, it's so competitive."
00:31:16.249,00:31:18.251,Everything was competition at that time.
00:31:23.673,00:31:28.052,"We were the same age, and we had similar tastes."
00:31:28.136,00:31:32.932,"Since we both came from another country, we relied on each other when we had a hard time."
00:31:33.016,00:31:36.436,We became like two peas in a pod.
00:31:36.519,00:31:38.646,We were like genuine twins.
00:31:42.692,00:31:46.905,"And during our days off, we'd always be together."
00:32:04.380,00:32:05.882,Was it hard for you?
00:32:20.688,00:32:24.400,"When I was having a hard time, I'd look at Rosé, and she'd be the same."
00:33:04.232,00:33:07.610,"For me, there were so many lessons in the beginning."
00:33:08.569,00:33:12.407,I took three to four dancing lessons a day and practiced.
00:33:12.490,00:33:16.077,I had vocal lessons from two to three teachers.
00:33:16.828,00:33:18.121,It was a rough time.
00:34:37.617,00:34:41.537,"For that, we'd have to plan everything ourselves, but we each had a role."
00:34:42.080,00:34:50.505,"If someone was in charge of vocals, we'd give them that role, but I always took on the role of the dancer."
00:34:51.506,00:34:53.800,So I'd always design the choreography.
00:34:54.592,00:34:58.221,Every month! Literally every month for five years.
00:35:00.431,00:35:03.351,"After a monthly review, you would be graded."
00:35:04.060,00:35:07.146,"You had those who got an A, those with Bs and those with Cs."
00:35:44.016,00:35:47.812,I rarely went home and had to practice on the weekends.
00:35:47.895,00:35:51.315,So my parents were quite upset and worried.
00:35:51.983,00:36:09.750,"But they're not really… the protective, overbearing type, and they knew this was something that I had to do, so they told me to stay strong and get it done."
00:36:37.737,00:36:46.245,"I started a bit later than the others, so I was able to make memories with friends and go to school."
00:36:46.329,00:36:50.082,I consider it a blessing now.
00:37:20.071,00:37:23.282,Waiting was the hardest part.
00:37:23.366,00:37:26.786,I didn't think I would make it. I was on the verge of letting it go.
00:37:32.166,00:37:37.672,"I'd ask myself, Do you want to give up because it's not easy?"
00:38:04.448,00:38:08.452,I had to keep fighting. I had to give it my all.
00:38:08.536,00:38:10.955,I don't care how long the training will take.
00:38:11.038,00:38:13.833,Bring it on! I don't care about that anymore!
00:38:16.836,00:38:22.758,So the CEO would put us into different groups every other month just to see.
00:38:29.390,00:38:41.485,"We were evaluated together, and the four of us did screen tests and recorded demos together."
00:38:45.531,00:38:47.950,It happened naturally.
00:38:49.493,00:38:51.329,We just clicked.
00:39:21.359,00:39:26.405,"When you're working in a group, everyone has their place and a role."
00:39:26.489,00:39:33.287,"When everyone settles into their best roles, that's how synergy is born."
00:39:33.371,00:39:36.499,That realization changed my outlook.
00:39:36.582,00:39:41.087,"When everyone is where they need to be, big things can happen."
00:40:17.498,00:40:22.253,Teddy felt like a CEO to us.
00:40:22.336,00:40:29.260,"If somebody did something with Teddy or met with Teddy, it was considered to be a big deal."
00:40:30.761,00:40:34.515,Everyone thought it was so cool.
00:40:36.934,00:40:39.770,I didn't know much about him.
00:40:39.854,00:40:41.814,I knew he was a 1TYM member.
00:40:57.079,00:40:59.915,The first time we met was -- When I was a trainee.
00:41:03.794,00:41:08.174,Meeting you was like the final stage of the debut.
00:41:08.257,00:41:11.093,"You were the final boss. If we meet you, we get to debut."
00:41:11.677,00:41:12.511,Finally!
00:41:14.430,00:41:19.059,"Oppa, do you remember -we recorded whistle chorus 1,000 times? -I do!"
00:42:02.561,00:42:08.275,YG Entertainment is expected to showcase its first new girl group in seven years since 2NE1 debuted.
00:42:08.359,00:42:12.780,"Under the direction of producer Teddy, this new group is being prepared."
00:42:12.863,00:42:16.867,Its members and debut songs have been shrouded in secrecy.
00:42:18.285,00:42:19.578,I'm shaking!
00:42:19.662,00:42:21.497,So shaky!
00:42:22.498,00:42:28.128,Various… diverse colors… How does it go?
00:42:47.565,00:42:48.857,Hello everyone.
00:42:48.941,00:42:50.943,I'm BLACKPINK's Rosé.
00:42:51.026,00:42:53.404,Hello everyone. I'm BLACKPINK's Jennie.
00:42:53.487,00:42:54.738,Hello everyone.
00:42:54.822,00:42:56.865,I'm BLACKPINK's Jisoo.
00:42:56.949,00:43:00.119,Hello everyone. I'm BLACKPINK's Lisa.
00:43:00.202,00:43:07.793,After training with my teammates all this time I'm nervous and excited that we finally debut on this stage.
00:43:07.876,00:43:12.965,"In the future, we will work hard to show everyone BLACKPINK's unique colors."
00:43:13.048,00:43:14.633,Please love us!
00:43:15.134,00:43:16.760,Thank you!
00:43:18.679,00:43:21.849,I think it happened just the way I thought it would.
00:43:33.902,00:43:35.195,I look scary.
00:43:39.491,00:43:42.369,Hello.
00:43:42.453,00:43:45.039,I can't wait. Can you tell us who's performing next?
00:43:45.122,00:43:48.542,Their two songs debuted exclusively here last week could be number one!
00:43:48.626,00:43:52.296,"Shall we see the performance of the hottest rookie, BLACKPINK?"
00:43:52.379,00:43:54.256,Music start!
00:44:05.434,00:44:15.110,"YG's new girl group, BLACKPINK, has topped on a music show only 14 days after their debut, which is the shortest time ever for a girl group."
00:44:15.194,00:44:19.615,I remember making our debut and winning awards.
00:44:26.163,00:44:29.333,"We felt like, Wow! We did it."
00:44:34.380,00:44:40.177,"Whistle kept going up and up, and when it hit number one, we were just so happy and excited."
00:44:45.557,00:44:50.729,I think I was most surprised when Whistle topped on the music charts.
00:44:50.813,00:44:52.231,That was the most exciting.
00:44:52.314,00:44:56.902,I remember we were in a practice room and we were number two.
00:44:56.985,00:44:59.613,We kept on checking but we had to practice.
00:44:59.697,00:45:00.698,We checked every hour.
00:45:00.781,00:45:03.200,Then someone came in and screamed.
00:45:04.410,00:45:06.912,I remember my friends telling me that they heard it.
00:45:06.995,00:45:09.707,"They said, your song is playing on the street."
00:45:09.790,00:45:11.250,It felt really weird back then.
00:45:11.333,00:45:15.254,"I was like, That's so cool. Shoot a video and send it to me."
00:45:36.024,00:45:38.652,Their dance is so powerful.
00:45:38.736,00:45:43.073,"When their music is played, you just instantly start dancing."
00:45:48.203,00:45:51.790,You can see they love what they are doing and are born to do it.
00:46:11.727,00:46:15.355,"When I was a trainee, nobody knew about me."
00:46:15.439,00:46:21.111,"But after I debuted as BLACKPINK, everyone would follow me no matter where I went."
00:46:21.195,00:46:24.740,I didn't know that we would become this famous.
00:46:29.411,00:46:30.537,Three hours.
00:46:33.499,00:46:38.295,"-Clear in front. -Everybody, get out."
00:46:47.054,00:46:48.972,Everybody look into the camera.
00:46:50.808,00:46:54.186,Then came the pressure for our next thing.
00:46:54.269,00:46:56.730,What now? What do we do?
00:46:56.814,00:47:01.109,Let's come up with something fresh. I felt like we were being chased.
00:47:10.327,00:47:12.120,The award goes to BLACKPINK!
00:47:25.175,00:47:26.760,Thank you! I love you all!
00:48:12.723,00:48:27.070,I still remember the first time… I went back to Thailand after my debut.
00:48:27.154,00:48:30.866,Because Thai teens see me as a Thai who has made it this far.
00:48:30.949,00:48:33.535,"They would say, I want to be like Lisa."
00:48:36.246,00:48:46.340,"WELCOME HOME WE MISSED YOU But at that moment, I wasn't sure if I was good enough to be their role model."
00:48:47.215,00:48:53.805,"I'm a singer, but I didn't know what kind of singer I wanted to be."
00:48:53.889,00:48:58.727,I kind of lost the goal. I was trying to find myself.
00:49:00.979,00:49:04.316,Could I really become their role model?
00:49:04.399,00:49:07.569,What should I do to not let them down?
00:49:08.862,00:49:11.949,These kinds of thoughts kept running through my mind.
00:49:32.761,00:49:35.180,You eat this one. Tanghulu is different.
00:49:35.263,00:49:38.350,Tanghulu has the freshness of the fruits.
00:49:38.433,00:49:41.144,"It's been a while, so the ratio is a little off."
00:49:41.228,00:49:43.605,-There was too much sugar. -It's a bit burnt.
00:49:44.314,00:49:45.941,-It still looks delicious. -Yeah.
00:49:52.280,00:49:54.616,We almost set the kitchen on fire.
00:49:54.700,00:49:57.452,"-We were making too much. -Yeah, we almost burnt it."
00:49:57.536,00:50:00.122,We almost made this dorm disappear.
00:50:10.966,00:50:11.800,How is it?
00:50:13.927,00:50:15.804,Is it good? I want a taste.
00:50:15.887,00:50:16.722,It's warm.
00:50:18.849,00:50:19.891,It's a bit burnt.
00:50:31.695,00:50:33.488,No. We didn't add any water.
00:50:33.572,00:50:37.826,"-What are you talking about? -No, you don't add water."
00:50:37.909,00:50:40.120,Unnie! You add water.
00:50:40.203,00:50:43.707,"-You add water? No, you don't. -Oh, my. See?"
00:50:43.790,00:50:46.001,Nothing works without me.
00:51:02.809,00:51:05.479,They don’t have that in other countries.
00:51:06.229,00:51:07.189,Right.
00:51:23.455,00:51:32.089,"When I first came to train as a singer, I had never tried singing or dancing before."
00:51:32.172,00:51:35.634,"I was lost, but you taught me a lot."
00:51:35.717,00:51:40.347,"For two of us, it was... The competition was fierce at the time."
00:51:40.430,00:51:42.933,There were about 20 to 30 trainees.
00:51:43.016,00:51:48.522,"Because we are the older ones of the group, the others came to us with the issues they were having."
00:51:48.605,00:51:53.193,"I knew what their problems were. They'd ask us, Unnie, what should we do?"
00:51:53.276,00:51:58.949,"I'd advise them to speak their mind, but they have a hard time doing that, so I end up taking care of it."
00:51:59.491,00:52:00.367,Right.
00:52:01.284,00:52:04.663,There's no doubt I feel a sense of responsibility.
00:52:04.746,00:52:07.374,I try my best to take care of the other girls.
00:52:16.591,00:52:19.427,Semi-success.
00:54:12.165,00:54:25.053,"After two, three o’clock… When I call you And when you see my call… Something like that."
00:54:26.137,00:54:28.515,-I think it's fine. -I want to hide right now.
00:54:28.598,00:54:31.142,-No. -I don't think I can do this.
00:57:24.274,00:57:29.154,"I have so many clothes, but there's not enough space, so I keep them on the balcony."
00:57:29.237,00:57:32.115,Don't we have to pack for the event in Japan?
00:57:32.198,00:57:34.617,Bring something like this. It's cold.
00:57:34.701,00:57:37.579,"-Bring a scarf too. -Oh, I don't have a scarf!"
00:57:37.662,00:57:39.664,-Give me one. -You are funny.
00:57:39.747,00:57:42.083,-Give me one. -I can't.
00:57:42.167,00:57:43.877,That's not a scarf.
00:57:43.960,00:57:50.258,"It is so tiring when we work, but when we don't work, I get stressed out about not working."
00:57:50.341,00:57:52.594,I think it's a dilemma.
00:57:52.677,00:57:55.221,"When we work, I really want to rest."
00:57:55.305,00:57:59.058,"But when we don't work, I end up wondering, What am I doing?"
00:58:00.310,00:58:02.437,This job has a lot of ups and downs.
00:58:02.520,00:58:04.147,There's nothing we can do about it.
00:58:04.772,00:58:09.819,"It's very random, and there's no regularity."
00:58:11.863,00:58:17.911,"The thing is, you can never tell how long this will last, so estimating is impossible. That's most challenging."
00:58:48.983,00:58:54.822,I think we were together for three years before we went on the world tour.
00:58:59.744,00:59:09.087,"We started the world tour in Asia, but Coachella marked the start of our tour in North America."
00:59:14.884,00:59:22.559,"After your first verse and other stuff, blow them kisses here because-- Before the next chorus?"
00:59:22.642,00:59:24.811,Come out during the chorus before you kiss.
00:59:24.894,00:59:26.563,So come out sooner?
00:59:26.646,00:59:30.358,Come out slowly and play here. It's boring to have you there too long.
00:59:31.067,00:59:39.200,"For the first time, a much more diverse group of fans will be looking forward to seeing us."
00:59:42.620,00:59:49.419,"Whether it be Playing With Fire or Boombayah, you're not dancing hard enough."
00:59:49.502,00:59:51.879,-Not dancing hard enough? -Not hard enough.
00:59:51.963,00:59:57.302,"The audience needs to be mesmerized by your energy, up close."
00:59:57.385,01:00:00.597,"You know your dance, but just do it a bit tighter."
01:00:00.680,01:00:02.640,Jisoo needs to get the notes right.
01:00:02.724,01:00:04.976,"You missed the rhythm, right? Too fast?"
01:00:05.059,01:00:07.353,I practiced with MR for the first time here.
01:00:07.437,01:00:09.939,The notes are a bit unstable when you begin.
01:00:10.023,01:00:12.317,But we shouldn't have said that on camera.
01:00:12.400,01:00:16.404,Hey… Don't air this.
01:00:21.075,01:00:24.162,The media says that K-pop queens have landed.
01:00:27.498,01:00:32.503,"Girl group BLACKPINK heated up their first world tour stop, Thailand."
01:00:33.671,01:00:40.094,It's special to have a concert in Lisa's hometown.
01:00:42.847,01:00:49.979,This is the first concert where BLACKPINK has been able to meet our Thai fans.
01:00:50.063,01:00:52.857,We will do our very best and will not disappoint the BLINK.
01:01:05.912,01:01:10.875,I wanted to give a performance that I could look and be content with.
01:01:11.626,01:01:15.463,My entire focus was on doing a performance that would leave no regrets.
01:01:17.715,01:01:21.844,"So when I got out there, I was thinking, Don't mess this up."
01:01:24.347,01:01:26.099,and You've got to nail this.
01:01:52.625,01:01:57.547,Everything was new to me on my first tour.
01:01:58.464,01:02:01.467,It was so great to meet so many fans around the world.
01:02:36.377,01:02:39.756,-It feels like it's sprained. -Is it worse on this side?
01:03:11.204,01:03:13.581,I’m going to eat it without ketchup.
01:03:36.854,01:03:41.359,"I'm hungry, so I ordered something simple."
01:03:52.954,01:03:54.080,Delicious.
01:04:10.388,01:04:20.398,"If someone is fed up one day, Lisa makes that person laugh."
01:04:20.481,01:04:23.109,She keeps us energized.
01:04:27.738,01:04:30.950,I think I overact a lot.
01:04:31.033,01:04:37.665,Or I tend to try to bring too much positivity when the mood is sour.
01:05:41.979,01:05:47.652,"Because it's such a big festival, when I was told that we were going, I couldn't believe it."
01:05:53.074,01:05:54.367,Is this for real?
01:05:56.911,01:05:58.621,Look over there!
01:06:13.928,01:06:30.611,Since we don't have much time… I was so nervous because I didn't know how our American fans would react.
01:06:59.265,01:07:01.767,I was so sick.
01:07:02.435,01:07:05.646,That was the sickest I've ever been.
01:07:05.730,01:07:09.942,My back was killing me. It hurt to move.
01:07:10.609,01:07:14.321,-I was pretty worried. -We were very worried.
01:07:18.284,01:07:21.287,-Hello -Good luck!
01:07:21.370,01:07:23.372,We're following Coachella...
01:07:29.587,01:07:34.508,"When I got onto that stage, I actually didn't realize that there were so many people."
01:07:37.845,01:07:39.513,Why are there so many people?
01:07:39.597,01:07:40.723,I don't know.
01:07:40.806,01:07:42.308,There are so many people.
01:07:46.645,01:07:50.357,-We can do it. -We can do it. It's fine.
01:07:50.441,01:07:52.234,"One, two, three! Go!"
01:07:52.318,01:07:54.028,"Jennie and Rosé, that way."
01:07:54.111,01:07:56.072,"Water, water!"
01:07:56.655,01:07:57.531,Here.
01:07:58.324,01:08:00.034,"Eye drops, somebody!"
01:08:00.618,01:08:02.369,Relax.
01:08:03.037,01:08:05.331,We're starting now!
01:08:10.795,01:08:27.394,"I was so nervous. The moment I set foot on the stage and saw the whole crowd shouting and cheering, I got the feeling, This is it!"
01:09:12.523,01:09:17.319,All races and all kinds of people came together there.
01:09:17.403,01:10:41.946,So it helped emphasize It makes me feel that I had chosen the right path.
01:10:42.029,01:10:44.865,This was what I really wanted to do in my life.
01:11:23.195,01:11:31.704,"After Coachella, I think I figured out how to have fun on stage."
01:11:31.787,01:11:36.292,"Don't concentrate on just yourself, but feed off this passion raging around you."
01:11:59.440,01:12:03.902,It doesn't matter if we grow old and get replaced by a younger generation.
01:12:03.986,01:12:06.572,As long as there is still someone talking about us.
01:12:06.655,01:12:09.450,Because they'll remember how we shone so bright.
01:14:44.480,01:14:46.231,I don't cry.
01:14:46.315,01:14:49.193,I don't cry. I cry last.
01:15:02.831,01:15:05.584,Watch your step. Be careful with your head.
01:15:05.667,01:15:08.086,Good work!
01:15:08.170,01:15:09.004,Bye!
01:15:16.678,01:15:17.804,A fan?
01:16:14.027,01:16:15.612,"Meat, meat!"
01:16:16.113,01:16:17.656,"-Careful, it's hot. -Okay."
01:16:17.739,01:16:20.659,-That looks amazing! -Can I have a bite?
01:16:23.954,01:16:25.914,-Do you know us? -Yes.
01:16:25.998,01:16:28.458,"-Weren't you here before? -Yes, that's right."
01:16:28.542,01:16:31.211,"-We were here when we were trainees. -Yes, you ate here."
01:16:31.295,01:16:34.590,-I remember. -I've been here since the start.
01:16:34.673,01:16:37.134,-I didn't give you good service. -Really?
01:16:37.217,01:16:38.635,Is that why you're so nice now?
01:16:38.719,01:16:40.220,Yes. I hope you enjoy the food.
01:16:40.304,01:16:42.180,-Thank you. -Thank you.
01:16:42.681,01:16:43.515,Totally.
01:16:44.057,01:16:46.351,Halsey contacted me all of a sudden.
01:16:46.435,01:16:47.644,She was at Paris?
01:17:03.493,01:17:07.122,-I want to live in Paris. -Me too! For a year.
01:17:07.205,01:17:10.542,-We will stay for a year. -You're Parisian already.
01:17:10.626,01:17:13.170,"After a year, I'd like to go to the U.S."
01:17:13.253,01:17:17.424,"I want to live in Paris, but I also want to live in the U.S. and England."
01:17:17.507,01:17:18.717,Twenty years?
01:17:20.177,01:17:23.055,I feel like Lisa would be traveling around the world.
01:17:36.860,01:17:38.695,I think we'd all be married.
01:17:38.779,01:17:42.407,"We'd have babies by then, 42, 44… We'll have children?"
01:17:42.491,01:17:46.703,"If not, we could be freshly married if married later in life."
01:17:47.287,01:17:48.914,We'll be freshly married?
01:17:48.997,01:17:50.707,No newborns!
01:17:51.291,01:17:54.127,Aren't we going to make a comeback?
01:17:54.211,01:17:55.587,At that age?
01:17:55.671,01:17:57.881,BLACKPINK!
01:17:57.964,01:17:59.716,We'll injure our backs!
01:17:59.800,01:18:01.176,We won't be able to dance.
01:18:01.259,01:18:02.803,We'll have to stand and sing.
00:00:45.378,00:00:47.464,Introducing BLACKPINK!
00:01:26.461,00:01:28.463,female Korean group of all time.
00:01:29.589,00:01:34.135,"…wildly popular K-pop group… K-pop sensations, BLACKPINK!"
00:01:39.349,00:01:41.684,the highest charting K-pop girl group ever.
00:01:43.812,00:01:46.314,the first K-pop girl group to perform at Coachella.
00:01:50.276,00:01:51.361,here is BLACKPINK!
00:02:26.062,00:02:30.191,There's a dessert. It's like a croissant with injeolmi.
00:02:43.788,00:02:47.667,"Ah, yay. Finally, one more, you know?"
00:02:47.750,00:02:50.962,"I think we're halfway there, maybe?"
00:02:51.045,00:02:57.051,"We're always halfway there. We're like, We have the songs… there. We just need to record them."
00:03:11.232,00:03:12.066,Yeah.
00:03:16.404,00:03:19.866,I don't think we've done something really girly yet.
00:03:19.949,00:03:32.378,"We've practiced and explored so many different things, um, during our trainee days, and so it's just a matter of how much of that we could end up showing as BLACKPINK."
00:03:58.529,00:04:02.075,I've written and produced every single song that's come out so far.
00:04:02.742,00:04:04.327,It's been about four years now.
00:04:05.036,00:04:10.208,"Our initial approach was more like… single, smash, single, hit."
00:04:11.042,00:04:14.379,"Now, we feel like we need to tell more of our personal story."
00:04:14.963,00:04:17.882,"And I know the fans are mad. Like, We want more and more."
00:04:18.675,00:04:23.429,"We do have a lot in here, but… we're very particular with what we put out."
00:04:36.693,00:04:38.152,I always dress like this.
00:04:50.665,00:04:53.084,Lady Gaga featuring BLACKPINK that's about to come out.
00:04:53.167,00:04:54.127,Oh!
00:04:57.380,00:05:00.049,We worked hard before New Year's for this.
00:05:22.405,00:05:24.949,I don't think any of us even expected this.
00:05:25.033,00:05:27.327,"Sometimes it gets to me, like, Oh, my God."
00:05:27.410,00:05:29.203,How do we live up to this hype?
00:06:01.652,00:06:02.737,"Take a bite, take a bite."
00:06:15.875,00:06:17.293,that makes them who they are.
00:06:23.341,00:06:24.550,and stand out.
00:06:44.654,00:06:48.449,"And she stays here 'til, like, six o'clock a.m. just in the studio."
00:06:48.533,00:06:50.701,"Sometimes I'm like, Wow! You still here?"
00:07:03.965,00:07:06.717,Straight-up Korean girl that grew up in Korea.
00:07:06.801,00:07:09.387,She's the unnie of the group. She's the oldest.
00:07:16.185,00:07:18.813,"I've known Jisoo for, let's say, a good six years."
00:07:18.896,00:07:22.817,I've seen her cry… once.
00:07:22.900,00:07:24.026,She's super smart.
00:07:24.569,00:07:28.322,"A lot of people might think she's book smart, but I would say she's street smart."
00:07:34.704,00:07:39.834,"She's always got that cool, calm, it's gonna be okay, we're all good smile."
00:07:46.632,00:07:52.889,"when the music starts, when it's crunch time, she has this executioner killer instinct."
00:08:01.772,00:08:03.691,She's super clear.
00:08:03.774,00:08:06.235,"Her opinions, her emotions."
00:08:06.319,00:08:07.862,She's a perfectionist.
00:08:14.202,00:08:17.872,"it's just different how they walk, how they talk, and how they dress."
00:08:17.955,00:08:21.876,"And the perfect balance, how they complement each other."
00:08:21.959,00:08:23.252,It's fascinating.
00:08:28.716,00:08:33.471,"so if Korean people make music, it's K-pop? I don't even get it. Like… It's Korean pop."
00:08:35.806,00:08:37.433,The only thing is language.
00:08:39.018,00:08:40.978,Why don't they do that for every country?
00:08:41.729,00:08:42.772,What is K-pop?
00:08:47.610,00:08:50.071,K-pop has become a worldwide cultural phenomenon.
00:08:50.154,00:08:53.115,The genre has been around for at least two decades.
00:08:57.078,00:08:58.246,Please welcome them.
00:09:25.856,00:09:29.652,"began making these polished groups of singers, rappers, and dancers."
00:09:32.029,00:09:33.489,is YG Entertainment.
00:09:54.594,00:09:56.596,Mastering every move.
00:09:57.972,00:10:00.474,Some make their debut after just a few months' training.
00:10:00.558,00:10:03.102,"For others, it could be up to a decade."
00:10:03.185,00:10:05.396,Many never make it to debut at all.
00:10:22.330,00:10:29.879,"'cause it's like trying to come up with something new, but fittings like this, it is one of the biggest, like, creative parts that we do."
00:10:43.893,00:10:46.729,"but that's-- Well, it's case by case."
00:11:15.883,00:11:18.928,"I don't think there's any, like, boundaries within that."
00:11:19.011,00:11:23.516,"We don't go, This is Korean, and this is Western. This is Asian."
00:11:23.599,00:11:26.268,I think fashion is really just international.
00:11:26.352,00:11:30.398,"The more that there aren't any boundaries, I think that's when you can get creative."
00:11:30.481,00:11:37.446,"And since we do crazy choreography on stage, it all has to be really engineered, basically."
00:11:37.530,00:11:39.990,Make sure nothing flops out anywhere.
00:12:03.639,00:12:10.563,"We're like, You missed your note at the 'eh', and, I should've gone slower at this part of the choreography, but I did it too quickly."
00:12:10.646,00:12:12.440,I missed my note. That wasn't good.
00:12:16.527,00:12:26.579,"We were so nervous… Sometimes if something's not working, or I'm not doing my best performance, it can be stressful."
00:12:44.054,00:12:46.056,-This is it. -This is it.
00:12:47.725,00:13:26.430,"I always avoid interviews or any questions about me because I would rather not talk about myself, but… At first, it was hard getting to know her, but once we became close, I could tell that she's very loyal, very sweet, and a lovely friend."
00:13:54.333,00:13:56.585,We're going to lift one leg up and do an arabesque.
00:14:00.631,00:14:12.434,"I feel like, out of all the members, You know, some days, just like every other human being, you feel extra happy."
00:14:12.518,00:14:16.021,"And some other days, you're feeling down."
00:14:16.105,00:14:25.573,"Singing, dancing, and rapping, I always enjoy it all the time, but we always have to be on stage looking perfect and performing the same thing."
00:14:25.656,00:14:28.325,It's like working out for two hours every day.
00:14:28.409,00:14:29.910,It never gets easy.
00:14:35.124,00:14:38.377,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow."
00:14:43.173,00:14:45.092,I was born in Korea.
00:14:46.343,00:14:49.179,It's just me and my mom. I'm the only child.
00:14:50.472,00:14:53.559,I was raised in Seoul until I was ten.
00:14:54.810,00:15:01.901,"I went to Australia and New Zealand to travel with my mom, and by the time we got to New Zealand, it was so nice and peaceful."
00:15:02.443,00:15:05.613,"She asked me, How do you feel about living here?"
00:15:05.696,00:15:08.949,"And I said, Yeah, I would like that."
00:15:10.451,00:15:14.455,"So, from ten to 15, I was in New Zealand by myself."
00:15:15.205,00:15:21.170,I never really got to spend so much time in the house with my mom… until recently.
00:15:25.674,00:15:29.219,"I got to just run around, learn so many things."
00:15:51.367,00:15:53.494,"go camping, go learn instruments."
00:15:53.577,00:15:55.162,"If you want, do art."
00:15:56.705,00:15:58.666,Everything was up to you.
00:15:58.749,00:16:02.294,"Even if you're ten, you still got to make your own decisions."
00:16:02.795,00:16:06.382,That was very important for me to have at a young age.
00:16:06.924,00:16:09.301,That built me as who I am right now.
00:16:12.262,00:16:14.223,I am super shy.
00:16:14.306,00:16:18.894,I was one of those people where I can't even order something on the phone.
00:16:18.978,00:16:20.521,"Like, I hated that."
00:16:31.782,00:16:36.412,"I went there, I checked the school out. Everything was kind of decided, like 80%."
00:16:36.495,00:16:45.212,"And I came back to New Zealand to pack my stuff up, and that's when I realized I don't want to go to America and do another study there by myself."
00:16:45.879,00:16:49.258,I actually want to become a singer. I don't know where it came from.
00:17:00.102,00:17:02.229,"And luckily, I got in right away."
00:17:02.312,00:17:05.357,"I was like, Wow! These people are so in to it!"
00:17:05.441,00:17:08.485,"They know what they're doing. I was like, Let's catch up."
00:17:08.569,00:17:10.112,That's all I had in mind.
00:17:34.678,00:17:38.098,"So I often wonder, What am I doing right now?"
00:17:52.696,00:17:57.367,"the very first group of people that trained with me, none of them are here with me right now."
00:19:08.647,00:19:09.481,Oh!
00:19:25.998,00:19:29.293,"She's always like that, but I don't really listen to her."
00:19:31.587,00:19:32.963,Whoa!
00:19:33.755,00:19:36.049,1997.
00:19:36.133,00:19:37.384,When I was born.
00:21:53.687,00:21:54.521,Such a kid.
00:23:11.348,00:23:12.599,I think.
00:24:12.993,00:24:15.162,It's okay. You're the prettiest one now.
00:25:30.779,00:25:32.239,"No, you're perfect right now."
00:25:35.575,00:25:38.578,"But you're different from back then, too."
00:25:53.552,00:25:59.391,"I think that there are very few who truly think, This is what I have to do. This is my path."
00:26:02.018,00:26:03.979,I don't think there are many like that.
00:26:35.385,00:26:38.471,I have a lot of thoughts running through my head.
00:26:43.435,00:26:49.149,"And singing is kind of like stress relief, and everything just kind of makes sense when I'm doing this."
00:27:30.523,00:27:32.984,"Sometimes, I actually have missed my trainee days."
00:27:35.904,00:27:39.491,"Because, back then, we were surrounded by music all the time."
00:27:41.117,00:27:44.954,"But these days we've got a lot of work, so I actually have to make time for this."
00:27:45.038,00:27:48.166,"That's why it's always at night, when I'm supposed to be sleeping."
00:27:49.042,00:27:51.127,"Hi, girls and boys."
00:27:52.921,00:27:56.341,I'm called Roseanne… and I just woke up.
00:27:56.424,00:27:58.051,And welcome to Pajama News.
00:28:01.304,00:28:05.183,And then I moved to Australia when I was eight.
00:28:12.148,00:28:14.234,"Back then, I was always on the piano."
00:28:14.317,00:28:22.701,"I'd like sit there, and I'd play this lullaby for myself, but I'd be really sleepy, and I'd fall asleep, and then I'd put my chin on my knee."
00:28:23.785,00:28:27.163,I went to church every Sunday and had a lot of Korean friends there.
00:28:27.997,00:28:31.543,"But then at school, I was just a normal Australian kid."
00:28:40.427,00:28:41.594,It's funny.
00:28:52.856,00:28:55.567,"He was like, Rosé, do you wanna audition?"
00:28:55.650,00:28:57.610,And I was so shocked.
00:28:57.694,00:29:01.281,"I think I asked him, Do I like music? Do I?"
00:29:01.364,00:29:03.324,"And he's like, Yeah, obviously."
00:29:03.408,00:29:06.745,"You're gonna have to, you know, try do something about it."
00:29:06.828,00:29:10.582,"Otherwise you're gonna be 25, and you're gonna regret that you didn't try anything."
00:29:23.094,00:29:29.225,"Then I went and auditioned, and then they called me, and they were like, Can you fly to Korea within two months?"
00:29:39.944,00:29:41.529,I dropped out of school.
00:29:42.697,00:29:45.283,"In Australia, I dropped out of school."
00:29:45.366,00:29:48.369,I had never even imagined myself living apart from my family.
00:29:48.453,00:29:51.623,I hadn't even slept more than two weeks out of home.
00:29:52.290,00:29:55.084,"It was a really-- Oh, my gosh. I'm gonna cry."
00:29:57.170,00:29:58.004,I'm gonna cry.
00:29:59.506,00:30:00.340,Yeah.
00:30:04.177,00:30:07.639,"The first night in the dorm, they were all in the same room."
00:30:07.722,00:30:09.140,Everybody was sleeping.
00:30:19.526,00:30:20.610,but it was us four.
00:30:20.693,00:30:22.570,We covered songs 'til morning.
00:30:22.654,00:30:25.114,"All four of us, we were singing. Somebody was harmonizing."
00:30:25.198,00:30:26.616,I think Jisoo was harmonizing.
00:30:27.450,00:30:29.786,It was so funny. Can you believe it?
00:30:44.717,00:30:46.344,-Nice. -I wanna have a look.
00:31:04.571,00:31:07.782,-I was nervous. -I'm sure you were nervous.
00:31:18.334,00:31:21.629,"She thought I was competition, and I was just really intimidated."
00:31:21.713,00:31:23.590,"Like, everybody is so good."
00:31:41.190,00:31:42.609,and we're wearing the same thing.
00:31:50.992,00:31:52.493,"See, she still has it sometimes."
00:31:53.870,00:31:54.954,-Yeah. -No.
00:31:57.123,00:31:59.584,I never knew I would live in Korea.
00:31:59.667,00:32:04.297,"Then all of a sudden at 16, I'm like… Now Korea is my home."
00:32:08.217,00:32:09.969,Even though you have me?
00:32:10.053,00:32:11.054,You?
00:32:11.137,00:32:12.138,You're not any help.
00:32:14.557,00:32:16.893,"-Yeah, 'cause I grew up with a sister. -Mm."
00:32:16.976,00:32:18.561,Think about not having a sister.
00:32:18.645,00:32:19.854,But Lisa was there.
00:32:32.784,00:32:39.540,I think what makes K-pop K-pop is the time that we spend as a trainee.
00:32:43.461,00:32:47.590,"We all live together, sort of like a boarding school, like a training version."
00:32:52.512,00:32:57.517,"They were planning on creating a big group, so they had a lot of girls there."
00:33:01.938,00:33:04.148,in every single subject.
00:33:16.828,00:33:17.954,It was a rough time.
00:33:21.749,00:33:25.586,and then practice again for another 13 days.
00:33:34.762,00:33:36.764,the repetition.
00:33:36.848,00:33:45.940,"But at such a young age, they are able to absorb all the techniques and the tools that they need for their next ten years."
00:33:49.986,00:33:54.615,"Jennie was like, The first thing you have to learn is that, and I'll just teach you the first moves."
00:33:54.699,00:33:58.077,"And she was like, Do this. And I was like, I don't know how."
00:34:05.835,00:34:06.753,It was cute.
00:34:06.836,00:34:17.930,"If you ask a 16-year-old to dance for the first time, it's the funniest thing. I looked like a… And then after that, I got so angry at myself."
00:34:18.014,00:34:21.017,"I was like, I am going to become like Lisa."
00:34:21.100,00:34:24.937,'Cause Lisa was the dancer. She was like… She was at the top.
00:34:31.944,00:34:37.533,"and we'd perform a solo song, a group song, and a group choreography."
00:34:40.203,00:34:41.370,but we each had a role.
00:34:51.506,00:34:53.716,So I'd always design the choreography.
00:34:54.592,00:34:58.137,Every month! Literally every month for five years.
00:35:09.690,00:35:15.488,a good friend of mine home every month because they got eliminated from the test.
00:35:16.072,00:35:21.035,"There were so many rules, so many things to just be like, Okay, they don't like this. They don't like that."
00:35:21.119,00:35:23.454,Everything that I did was wrong.
00:35:27.792,00:35:34.924,and trying to keep everything together when I hear those things… It's really harsh.
00:35:35.007,00:35:37.385,It wasn't a very happy vibe.
00:35:38.177,00:35:42.306,"We're not allowed to drink, or smoke, or get a tattoo."
00:36:13.462,00:36:18.509,"…and I would always call her and tell her, Mom, it's so hard."
00:36:19.218,00:36:20.803,"She'd say, Come home. I'd say, No."
00:36:20.887,00:36:23.806,"My dad sent me, and he was like, Rosé, come home."
00:36:23.890,00:36:25.933,"He's like, We want you back home."
00:36:26.017,00:36:28.811,"And I hated that. I hated it whenever they would say, Come home."
00:36:28.895,00:36:30.605,That was the last thing I wanted to hear.
00:36:59.091,00:37:00.092,how to sing.
00:37:00.176,00:37:09.101,"But one thing I wish is to maybe have lived at home until I was like 18, 19."
00:37:09.185,00:37:14.148,A lot of people make lots of memories as a high school student.
00:37:15.566,00:37:17.026,But I never had that.
00:37:30.289,00:37:32.083,not knowing where this was going.
00:37:39.548,00:37:46.430,"The tougher they treated me, I'm like, I'm gonna get through it, and I'm gonna show them that I'm worth it."
00:37:54.981,00:37:57.191,I'm not gonna go back without doing anything.
00:37:57.692,00:37:59.944,That would be embarrassing for me. That's what I thought.
00:38:22.842,00:38:26.220,And there was a point where he pointed the four of us out.
00:38:58.919,00:39:01.839,"Because usually there's like, Oh, I wanna sing more."
00:39:01.922,00:39:04.508,"Or, Oh, I wanna be in the middle."
00:39:04.592,00:39:07.762,There's always those little fights going on in the groups.
00:39:07.845,00:39:11.223,"But when it was the four of us, it was clear what we were doing."
00:39:12.016,00:39:15.728,And that's what made it possible for us to be in a group.
00:39:15.811,00:39:18.606,"You know, four girls being in one group is not easy."
00:39:26.489,00:39:34.163,"And when everyone settles into their roles, that's how synergy is born."
00:39:59.772,00:40:05.111,"Then we started cutting some songs, and sonically, whatever that sounded the best."
00:40:05.194,00:40:07.571,"The four girls right now, the combination."
00:40:07.655,00:40:12.076,"And of course you start looking at their individuality, like their character."
00:40:12.660,00:40:14.328,The four of them just felt right.
00:40:47.403,00:40:51.866,and I just wanted to become someone that I needed when I was young.
00:40:51.949,00:40:56.579,"I didn't have somebody that's a little more outside looking in, telling me where to go."
00:41:01.625,00:41:03.127,I couldn't really talk to him.
00:41:14.430,00:41:18.017,"Oppa, do you remember… how we had to record that whistling sound 1,000 times?"
00:41:21.562,00:41:22.813,I cannot forget that.
00:41:22.897,00:41:31.363,"And we almost didn't come out with Whistle for our debut song, but-- But last minute, we were like, It has to be that one."
00:41:33.824,00:41:35.201,and it's super minimal.
00:41:35.284,00:41:37.328,It just sounded too empty for a lot of people.
00:41:37.411,00:41:40.498,"Most people were against it. We just pushed forward, whatever."
00:41:41.290,00:41:42.750,"Hey, you know that photo there?"
00:41:42.833,00:41:46.128,That's our very first photo session as BLACKPINK.
00:41:47.379,00:41:49.089,It's oppa's favorite photo.
00:41:50.049,00:41:54.803,"As soon as I saw that photo, how it turned out, I was like, Oh, this is gonna be fun."
00:42:22.498,00:42:44.311,"Various… diverse colors… It didn't necessarily have to be, Wow! This group came out, and they're so perfect in every single way."
00:42:44.812,00:42:47.481,"Like, I wanted people to be curious about us."
00:44:59.697,00:45:00.656,We'd check every hour.
00:45:00.739,00:45:02.658,"And then someone came in and said, Oh, my God!"
00:45:11.333,00:45:14.670,"I was like, Oh, my God, that's so cool! Shoot a video! Send me the video!"
00:45:25.597,00:45:28.016,Their sound is super different from other K-pop groups.
00:45:30.227,00:45:32.938,and it really shows how anyone can achieve their dreams.
00:45:53.709,00:45:55.335,that I can actually vibe with.
00:46:43.175,00:46:46.970,"But after debut, that's when you start getting a lot of responsibilities."
00:47:39.147,00:47:44.486,as Ddu-Du Ddu-Du has become the most viewed Korean music video in 24 hours.
00:48:02.421,00:48:05.382,it also becomes very overwhelming at some points.
00:48:36.246,00:48:46.214,WELCOME HOME LISA WE MISSED YOU I wasn't sure if I was really good enough to be their role model.
00:49:49.569,00:49:52.197,but it's hard to find it here in Korea.
00:50:03.917,00:50:06.253,She got better in the last six months.
00:50:06.336,00:50:10.257,"She understands everything that I say, so I do talk to her in English sometimes."
00:50:13.927,00:50:15.303,Is it good? I want a taste.
00:50:20.559,00:50:21.393,Mm!
00:50:26.148,00:50:27.649,Not bad but not good.
00:50:27.733,00:50:30.694,Yeah. Let's be honest. It was a fail.
00:50:30.777,00:50:31.611,Yes.
00:50:40.203,00:50:42.748,"You add water? No, you don't add water."
00:50:49.046,00:50:50.881,"other than your name, is how old are you?"
00:50:50.964,00:50:54.968,"And as soon as they say they're older, it's like, Oh, you're unnie."
00:50:55.052,00:51:00.682,"So, unnie is basically what you call an older sister."
00:51:00.766,00:51:10.984,"It's like-- It's normally unnie if you're older than me, and oppa if you're a guy."
00:51:11.485,00:51:18.742,"It takes a while to get used to, but once you get a hold of it, it's better than calling their names."
00:51:19.701,00:51:21.161,She's not Jisoo. She's unnie.
00:51:21.870,00:51:23.371,"It's like family, in a way."
00:52:24.516,00:52:26.852,"-Oh, my God! -No words, no melody whatsoever."
00:52:51.168,00:52:52.544,or they're afraid of water?
00:52:52.627,00:52:57.215,I've always been so afraid of getting in the studio or writing something.
00:52:57.299,00:53:02.220,I always thought just someday I have to just start it. I have to.
00:53:08.935,00:53:10.437,-I'm gonna still keep this one. -Okay.
00:53:10.520,00:53:12.147,-Let's try one more time. -Okay.
00:53:12.230,00:53:15.150,Do I change the rhythm? I keep going for the same thing.
00:53:15.233,00:53:18.361,-Do you feel uncomfortable singing it? -Do I feel uncomfortable singing it?
00:53:18.445,00:53:21.531,Like slightly. Maybe I'll try singing it one more time.
00:53:21.615,00:53:24.784,"I've seen Joe a few times, and his music's like amazing."
00:53:25.452,00:53:29.789,"I was just like, to Teddy, What do you think if he helps me out?"
00:53:29.873,00:53:34.377,So here's what we worked on. This is Rosé's first recorded song.
00:53:37.839,00:53:42.552,"because I said nobody can listen to it. I was like, Hide it from everyone."
00:53:48.725,00:53:53.563,"When it comes to writing songs, Rosé has certain stories in mind."
00:53:53.647,00:53:56.942,And she's shy about sharing that story.
00:53:57.025,00:53:59.069,It's just super personal to her.
00:53:59.569,00:54:00.946,It's like her diary.
00:54:05.283,00:54:06.576,You sounded nervous in that one.
00:54:34.521,00:54:37.524,"He was like, You need to learn how to be more vulnerable in the studio."
00:54:37.607,00:54:51.830,"That's something I can't do too easily, but I was gonna say-- I really have a lot of respect for music, so I don't wanna be just like another girl who sings and just kind of tells everybody that she writes music."
00:54:51.913,00:54:53.373,That's the last thing I wanna be.
00:54:59.337,00:55:02.007,I feel more intimidated when I'm by myself.
00:55:02.090,00:55:05.719,"When I'm in my room by myself, and I go, Should I try and write something?"
00:55:05.802,00:55:07.762,I think I'm way more intimidated then.
00:55:08.305,00:55:11.933,"'Cause it's just me. I don't know if my opinions are right, and that scares me."
00:55:12.017,00:55:13.768,I feel like I scare myself the most.
00:55:17.439,00:55:18.732,What's our tempo?
00:55:19.566,00:55:23.737,I found these chords maybe like a month ago.
00:55:23.820,00:55:26.281,"I was like-- I liked it. I was like, This sounds cool."
00:55:26.364,00:55:28.158,"And ever since then, I just play it."
00:55:32.287,00:55:34.497,Do you think I could do it? I've never tried this.
00:55:43.882,00:55:51.431,"It's nice to have just the right amount of people in the room, who are just there to accept whatever is there and make it into something."
00:55:55.018,00:55:59.439,"Joe always says, This is the safe ground. Everything's a secret in here."
00:55:59.522,00:56:02.692,"You can make a fool out of yourself, and we won't tell anyone."
00:56:04.110,00:56:05.195,Ah.
00:56:06.821,00:56:09.657,It feels just like expressing myself.
00:56:10.241,00:56:13.995,Whereas I would always sing songs of other artists.
00:56:14.079,00:56:17.582,That's more like borrowing their emotions and making it mine.
00:56:17.665,00:56:22.170,Whereas this is totally just speaking from my point of view.
00:56:34.891,00:56:42.482,"I'm almost like a baby trying to speak in the music, trying to sing… for the first time."
00:57:16.808,00:57:20.186,"Hello. Ah, ow! You just bit me."
00:57:20.270,00:57:22.814,Coco bit me. Ah!
00:57:22.897,00:57:24.190,"Coco like, I don't care."
00:58:21.247,00:58:25.960,"This year has been pack and unpack, and unpack and pack and unpack."
00:58:26.044,00:58:26.920,That's a song.
00:58:34.010,00:58:42.185,"to plan the resting part, 'cause last year, we were just like spending time like… And then the tour hit us, and we're like, Oh, my God."
00:59:11.130,00:59:14.801,"start going outside of Asia, that was like a dream."
00:59:18.012,00:59:21.349,because you're coming out during the chorus before you kiss.
00:59:26.646,00:59:27.939,Come out slowly and play here.
00:59:37.365,00:59:39.242,will be looking forward to seeing us.
01:01:46.160,01:01:51.040,it's amazing to see all these fans filling up the big arenas that we didn't expect.
01:02:13.813,01:02:17.692,to try to give them the best stage every day is a lot of pressure.
01:02:30.037,01:02:32.039,our body just gives up on us.
01:02:42.467,01:02:45.887,and take care of my body 'cause I'm like a grandma. I'm sick everywhere.
01:02:46.012,01:02:47.722,"Honestly, I need to take care of myself."
01:02:48.890,01:02:54.687,"I lose breath a little easier than other people, and I can't jump as much as other people."
01:03:03.321,01:03:06.574,I thought it would all be just really exciting and fun.
01:03:19.545,01:03:22.131,It felt like there was this big hole in my life.
01:03:22.215,01:03:24.550,What I'm basically living for is tomorrow's show.
01:03:28.179,01:03:35.144,"I love being on stage because that's when I feel the most alive, yet when we come back to the hotel, I felt so empty."
01:03:49.575,01:03:52.203,And that's when I realized I'm homesick.
01:04:06.467,01:04:09.345,She brings positive energy into the group.
01:04:31.033,01:04:37.456,Or I tend to try to bring too much positivity when the mood is sour.
01:04:39.542,01:04:40.751,-Yeah. -Okay.
01:04:40.835,01:04:42.378,I'll keep doing that.
01:04:51.846,01:04:58.936,"is we try to take care of ourselves individually, and then come together healthy and happy so that the whole thing works."
01:05:06.152,01:05:07.904,that is my happy face.
01:05:08.905,01:05:13.993,"We're all human, and we're ladies, so we have our moments."
01:05:14.076,01:05:19.165,"But when you have the good positive energy going on, it helps."
01:05:24.712,01:05:29.383,"Los Angeles, what's up? We're BLACKPINK on 97.1 AMP radio."
01:05:33.220,01:05:34.221,to perform at Coachella.
01:05:40.394,01:05:41.896,is in the US this weekend.
01:06:01.832,01:06:04.001,It was really nerve-wracking.
01:06:04.085,01:06:08.422,We're a group from South Korea representing our country.
01:06:11.384,01:06:13.177,that we've been waiting for this.
01:06:19.183,01:06:22.395,and we're gonna go from Whistle and Kiss and Make Up.
01:06:34.573,01:06:41.831,"is filled with fans who come to watch us, but people who come to Coachella are just people who love music in general."
01:06:42.790,01:06:46.877,I personally was really worried that not many people would walk up to our show.
01:06:49.839,01:06:53.843,"I don't know, 100 people or 200 people at least."
01:06:53.926,01:06:56.595,I was just hoping to have somebody watching us.
01:08:14.673,01:08:56.549,and saw all the crowds shouting and cheering… there are people that understand that this isn't just K-pop music.
01:09:17.403,01:09:39.175,"So it helped emphasize… where people are open to new culture, new music."
01:09:39.258,01:10:03.532,"Who would have imagined, at Coachella, thousands of people singing in Korean… It just matters if it's the right atmosphere."
01:10:03.616,01:10:05.534,Everybody's on the same vibe.
01:10:22.927,01:10:24.428,with our work.
01:10:26.680,01:10:29.433,Like all those training years were worth it!
01:10:54.583,01:10:57.169,I think I'll remember today for the rest of my life.
01:11:16.188,01:11:19.108,but one group that has everybody talking is BLACKPINK.
01:11:19.191,01:11:23.112,"If you didn't know who they were before, you definitely know who they are now."
01:11:31.787,01:11:36.125,"Don't concentrate on just yourself, but feed off this passion raging around you."
01:12:54.787,01:12:59.416,"When you're really invested in what you do, that's what makes things happen."
01:13:12.096,01:13:13.305,Thank you so much!
01:13:21.730,01:13:33.742,"Sadly, very, very extremely sadly, um… Like we said before, this will be our last concert on this tour."
01:13:33.826,01:13:40.666,"And I feel like all four of us, we did really well, and I'm very proud of each and every one of us."
01:13:43.877,01:14:01.854,"Like, I know you guys only see the stuff that's on stage, but I feel like we all go through so much else… and talking to the audience."
01:14:01.937,01:14:05.899,"Then I was talking, and I kinda looked at my members, and I was like, Ah! Then I started crying."
01:14:05.983,01:14:09.069,"Because it felt like the first time talking to, you know, each."
01:14:09.153,01:14:17.244,"Like, I feel like it's so hard that everybody stays away from home… Happy tears."
01:14:17.327,01:14:19.830,-Happy tears. -Happy tears. It's okay.
01:14:37.139,01:14:38.056,Aw!
