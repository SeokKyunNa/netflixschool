00:03:32.170,00:03:33.588,Marianne!
00:03:33.671,00:03:35.131,"Marianne, come on!"
00:03:35.215,00:03:37.091,-We got to go right now! -We can't leave!
00:03:37.175,00:03:40.845,"-Honey, we got to go right this second. -We can't leave! Not yet."
00:03:40.929,00:03:42.847,"Look at these readings, honey! Let's stick around."
00:03:42.931,00:03:44.182,"Forget the readings, Marianne!"
00:03:44.265,00:03:45.892,"Juan, Chico, get what you can, as quick as you can."
00:04:48.246,00:04:50.248,We're going to get out. Don't worry.
00:05:00.550,00:05:01.801,Marianne?
00:05:05.930,00:05:07.682,"Oh, no!"
00:05:28.453,00:05:30.163,"Come on, Harry. I know you're there."
00:05:30.246,00:05:32.707,We're picking up something in the Northern Cascades.
00:05:32.790,00:05:34.500,I need your opinion on it.
00:05:35.877,00:05:39.130,"Listen, get down here as soon as you get this message."
00:05:39.213,00:05:44.010,"You better pack for a couple of days. Harry, are you sure you're not there?"
00:06:05.490,00:06:09.202,Paul called. There's something going on in the Northern Cascades.
00:06:09.285,00:06:11.454,"You can't leave work alone, can you?"
00:06:11.537,00:06:13.956,"Harry, going on vacation isn't going to kill you."
00:06:19.754,00:06:22.924,"Good morning. So, what's going on in the Cascades?"
00:06:23.007,00:06:28.554,"I am sorry I had to drag you in like this, but we are picking up some activity around Dante's Peak."
00:06:29.138,00:06:31.808,"This is a joke, right? Dante's Peak?"
00:06:34.644,00:06:37.480,What do you think the odds are against an eruption up there?
00:06:37.563,00:06:38.648,A thousand to one?
00:06:38.731,00:06:41.734,"More like 10,000 to 1. What's the depth?"
00:06:41.818,00:06:43.486,Ten to twenty kilometers.
00:07:41.210,00:07:43.880,You're number seven. It's on the corner there.
00:07:45.214,00:07:47.300,Any idea where I might find Mayor Wando?
00:07:47.383,00:07:50.636,"She should be right around the corner, accepting some award."
00:07:50.720,00:07:52.680,Dante's Peak was just named the best...
00:07:52.763,00:07:55.266,"Well, second-best place to live in the United States."
00:07:55.349,00:07:58.478,"-Population: under 20,000. -Good for you. What was number one?"
00:07:58.561,00:08:02.523,I don't know. Some piece of crap town out in Montana. Who cares?
00:08:08.988,00:08:11.532,from Money magazine for this wonderful award.
00:08:12.575,00:08:13.868,What is it?
00:08:13.951,00:08:16.704,"Lauren, is it Karen or Kathy?"
00:08:16.787,00:08:20.708,"It's Karen, Mom. For the tenth time. Karen."
00:08:20.791,00:08:22.043,And you're gonna be late.
00:08:22.126,00:08:24.670,-Have you seen my good jacket? -You don't have a good jacket.
00:08:24.754,00:08:28.424,"-Honey, the blue one? -Oh, that one. It's in the kitchen."
00:08:28.508,00:08:31.469,"Okay. Graham, it's time to go."
00:08:32.345,00:08:34.764,-Where is your brother? -He said he'll meet us there.
00:08:35.515,00:08:38.017,-There's your jacket. -Okay.
00:08:55.076,00:08:56.202,I gotta say something.
00:08:56.285,00:09:00.164,"Folks, we're real sorry for the delay. We're gonna get started in one moment."
00:09:16.389,00:09:17.890,"-Hey, Bill. -Hey, Rachel."
00:09:20.560,00:09:24.480,"I'd like to introduce the mayor of Dante's Peak, Rachel Wando."
00:09:26.524,00:09:27.567,It's about time.
00:09:34.615,00:09:39.370,"To kick off the festivities, I would like to introduce Karen Narlington of Money magazine."
00:09:45.084,00:09:50.756,"Mayor Wando, it gives me great pleasure to present to you a Money magazine award."
00:09:51.257,00:09:55.928,"Dante's Peak, the second most desirable place to live in the United States."
00:09:56.012,00:09:57.638,"Population: under 20,000."
00:10:09.358,00:10:11.193,-Thank you. -It's Karen!
00:10:11.819,00:10:14.155,"Thank you, Karen. Thank you, Lauren."
00:10:16.198,00:10:17.992,This award means a lot to us.
00:10:18.117,00:10:20.328,We've been proud of our town for a long time.
00:10:20.411,00:10:33.132,"It's beautiful. It's safe. It's a wonderful place And now, with the prospect of a major investment in our economic future by Mr. Elliot Blair of Blair Industries... Will you stand up, Elliot?"
00:10:35.092,00:10:37.136,Next year we're going to be number one.
00:10:40.640,00:10:42.266,Come on in. It's great.
00:10:59.825,00:11:01.452,"So, is this great or what?"
00:11:01.535,00:11:05.206,"-Mmm. Sure beats the hell out of LA. -Yes, it does."
00:11:05.289,00:11:07.041,Maybe we should move here.
00:11:07.124,00:11:09.835,-I don't think so. I'd go nuts in a week. -Yeah.
00:11:13.464,00:11:16.592,It's nothing. Some animal must have scared them.
00:11:18.761,00:11:20.346,-Jerry? -What the hell was that?
00:11:24.141,00:11:28.062,"So everybody get out there, have a great time, and enjoy this beautiful day."
00:11:33.067,00:11:35.069,"-Good job, Mom. -Where is your brother?"
00:11:35.152,00:11:36.737,-I don't know. -I know where he is.
00:11:38.155,00:11:40.491,Harry Dalton with the U.S. Geological Survey...
00:11:42.118,00:11:44.787,"-Excuse me, Mayor Wando, gentlemen... -I'm sorry, you are?"
00:11:45.329,00:11:46.580,Harry Dalton.
00:11:46.664,00:11:48.332,Oh. From Portland.
00:11:48.416,00:11:50.751,"Yes, your boss called and said that you were coming."
00:11:50.835,00:11:52.920,"-Elliot, can I call you later? -Sure."
00:11:53.003,00:11:55.172,And that I should show you around. Is that right?
00:11:55.256,00:11:56.257,Is this a good time?
00:11:56.841,00:11:57.800,Uh...
00:11:58.509,00:11:59.468,Yeah.
00:12:11.564,00:12:12.898,This will only take a second.
00:12:16.610,00:12:18.279,"So, you have any kids?"
00:12:19.572,00:12:21.449,"Hmmm. No, I don't."
00:12:21.949,00:12:23.701,"You're lucky. Right, Mom?"
00:12:24.285,00:12:27.538,"Oh, no, honey. Sometimes having kids is just wonderful, and..."
00:12:30.958,00:12:32.084,Graham!
00:12:35.045,00:12:36.255,"My brother, Graham..."
00:12:37.089,00:12:40.217,"-He's in a lot of trouble. -Mmm-hmm. Yes, I think he is."
00:12:43.053,00:12:44.305,You get in trouble?
00:12:44.388,00:12:46.056,-No. -No. Of course not.
00:12:53.397,00:12:54.899,Get in the car.
00:12:56.734,00:12:58.152,You should know better.
00:13:02.948,00:13:05.493,-I don't know what's wrong with you. -Can we do this later?
00:13:05.576,00:13:09.330,The mine is dangerous. It's off-limits.
00:13:20.049,00:13:23.260,"-I heard Mrs. Mackey was sick. -You know, just a touch of the flu."
00:13:23.344,00:13:24.553,And how are you?
00:13:25.596,00:13:29.475,"Dr. Fox, this is Harry Dalton of the United States Geological Survey."
00:13:29.558,00:13:30.935,"-Oh, hey. -How do you do?"
00:13:31.435,00:13:32.311,Nice meeting you.
00:13:32.394,00:13:33.854,"-Bye, Jane. -Bye."
00:13:45.074,00:13:46.784,It looks like black licorice.
00:13:46.867,00:13:48.035,Can I see it?
00:13:50.037,00:13:52.164,Hmmm. You know what this is?
00:13:53.499,00:13:55.042,This is a smoky quartz crystal.
00:13:55.125,00:13:58.003,And I had one just like it when I was your age.
00:13:58.087,00:13:59.171,Very lucky.
00:13:59.255,00:14:01.131,-You know about this stuff? -Mmm-hmm.
00:14:01.215,00:14:02.550,"Yeah, just a little bit."
00:14:02.633,00:14:04.843,Dr. Dalton's a geologist.
00:14:04.927,00:14:06.679,"Volcanologist, actually."
00:14:06.762,00:14:08.347,You mean like Dr. Spock?
00:14:08.430,00:14:09.557,Mr. Spock.
00:14:09.640,00:14:12.351,"Well, kind of, but without the ears, you know?"
00:14:13.352,00:14:15.563,"-Mom, drop me off at Grandma's. -Me, too."
00:14:17.982,00:14:20.651,No one... No one's going!
00:14:20.734,00:14:22.236,Dr. Dalton has been patient enough.
00:14:22.319,00:14:24.780,You can drop the kids off at your mother's. I don't mind.
00:14:24.864,00:14:27.533,She's not my mother. She's my mother-in-law.
00:14:27.616,00:14:29.326,Or my ex-mother-in-law.
00:14:55.853,00:14:57.062,"Hello, Ruth."
00:14:58.731,00:15:00.274,"Hi, Rachel."
00:15:01.400,00:15:02.568,You Rachel's boyfriend?
00:15:04.945,00:15:09.325,"No, Harry Dalton. United States Geological Survey."
00:15:09.825,00:15:12.036,Just up here to check on your mountain.
00:15:12.620,00:15:16.206,Bunch of you people came up here after Mount Saint Helens went nuts.
00:15:16.290,00:15:19.376,There was nothing going on then. There's nothing going on now.
00:15:19.460,00:15:24.715,"-Yes, well, um... -I need to take him up to the high lake and wondered if the kids could stay here."
00:15:24.798,00:15:28.218,Sure. But why don't we all go? We can go swimming.
00:15:28.302,00:15:30.471,Go to the hot springs on the way back?
00:16:05.255,00:16:07.049,Checking the acidity in the water.
00:16:19.603,00:16:24.692,We'll take these pH readings and check them against the ones that we did about 15 years ago.
00:16:24.775,00:16:26.527,-Where? From here? -Uh-huh.
00:16:26.610,00:16:28.028,And Mount Saint Helens.
00:16:28.112,00:16:31.532,Those trees over there. Any idea when they died?
00:16:32.241,00:16:34.785,No. Maybe from the winter storms.
00:16:35.369,00:16:37.705,Why? You think we've got a problem?
00:16:38.622,00:16:40.874,No. I don't think so.
00:16:41.625,00:16:43.627,I do about 25 to 30 of these a year.
00:16:44.211,00:16:47.089,98% of the time they're just false alarms.
00:16:47.673,00:16:49.091,And the other 2%?
00:16:49.591,00:16:54.179,You wouldn't have to worry about moving up on that Best Places to Live list.
00:17:05.315,00:17:06.442,"Come on, girl."
00:17:07.526,00:17:09.445,You guys be careful.
00:17:09.528,00:17:13.032,Watch out for poison oak when you put your swimsuits on.
00:17:54.156,00:17:57.034,A man who stares at a rock must have a lot on his mind.
00:18:00.996,00:18:05.000,These old rocks will give us some idea of when this area was last active.
00:18:05.084,00:18:08.462,"-Yeah, when was that? -About 7,000 years ago."
00:18:22.351,00:18:23.602,What is it?
00:18:23.685,00:18:25.437,"We found two dead squirrels, Mom."
00:18:26.146,00:18:27.981,That's what this fuss was all about?
00:18:28.732,00:18:30.400,Don't touch them.
00:18:34.947,00:18:36.657,They're dropping like that all over the mountain.
00:18:37.741,00:18:39.660,"Come on, let's go."
00:18:51.088,00:18:53.757,It smells like your room. You go in there.
00:18:55.259,00:18:57.636,"Hey, Grandma. Somebody left their clothes here."
00:18:58.262,00:19:01.348,Sometimes couples sneak up here for a hot dip...
00:19:01.431,00:19:02.891,and some hot nookie.
00:19:03.559,00:19:05.435,"Ruth, for God's sake."
00:19:12.442,00:19:15.028,"Lauren, move. Lauren, get out of the way."
00:19:16.905,00:19:18.198,"Watch me, Mom."
00:19:20.033,00:19:21.660,"Graham, no! No!"
00:19:21.743,00:19:23.120,No. Stop. Stop.
00:19:32.921,00:19:34.798,Get the whole shooting match in here.
00:19:36.758,00:19:37.885,I don't know.
00:19:38.385,00:19:40.888,But the acidity in the lake is high enough to bother me.
00:19:40.971,00:19:44.933,There's enough carbon dioxide coming out of the soil to start killing trees and wildlife...
00:19:45.642,00:19:47.311,Paul... Paul...
00:19:47.895,00:19:50.147,You sent me up here to check. I'm doing that.
00:19:50.230,00:19:52.024,I think attention should be paid.
00:19:53.817,00:19:56.153,All right. I'll call you.
00:19:58.697,00:19:59.698,-Yeah. -Yeah.
00:19:59.781,00:20:01.241,"-Bye, Mom. -I love you."
00:20:01.325,00:20:02.826,"-I love you, Mom. -Love you."
00:20:04.453,00:20:06.872,"I don't think I'll be too late, Ruth."
00:20:10.042,00:20:11.084,You okay?
00:20:11.877,00:20:12.794,Yeah.
00:20:14.171,00:20:15.881,Any idea who they were?
00:20:15.964,00:20:17.799,"No, never seen them before."
00:20:18.717,00:20:20.510,"-Backpackers, maybe. -Mmm."
00:20:25.349,00:20:27.351,How big of a problem do you think we have?
00:20:29.561,00:20:32.064,But I think you should call a city council meeting.
00:20:34.149,00:20:37.110,I thought this was supposed to be an extinct volcano.
00:20:37.194,00:20:40.739,"Yeah, not extinct, just dormant..."
00:20:41.531,00:20:42.783,"as in, sleeping."
00:20:43.659,00:20:46.036,And your volcano might just be waking up.
00:20:46.119,00:20:50.582,"Mr. Dalton, you're talking about the evacuation of 7,400 people."
00:20:50.666,00:20:52.251,You don't think that's extreme?
00:20:52.834,00:20:57.881,All I'm saying is that you consider alerting the town to the possibility of an evacuation.
00:20:57.965,00:21:10.394,"What Mr. Dalton here doesn't realize is that if Elliot Blair gets the idea that there's some kind of problem here, he's gonna take his $18 million, his 800 jobs, -and he's going to evacuate. -Les, two people are dead and..."
00:21:10.477,00:21:12.521,This is the first opportunity in 40 years...
00:21:14.982,00:21:19.278,"Look, it's been a very long day. Let's try to treat each other nicely."
00:21:20.570,00:21:23.824,"Norman, pull out the town's emergency evacuation plans."
00:21:23.907,00:21:25.367,We should at least have a look at them.
00:21:45.387,00:21:47.639,"Ah, look at this nice little town..."
00:21:48.765,00:21:51.685,nestled all snug and cozy right against the mountain.
00:21:56.857,00:21:58.108,All right.
00:21:58.191,00:22:01.361,The conference room ought to be big enough for you to set up in.
00:22:01.445,00:22:03.822,Thanks. Do you know where I can find Harry Dalton?
00:22:03.905,00:22:05.240,I expected to see him here.
00:22:05.324,00:22:08.744,He's at the city council chambers. He and the mayor called a meeting.
00:22:11.163,00:22:12.122,Okay.
00:22:12.622,00:22:15.167,"So, when is this mountain likely to blow up?"
00:22:15.250,00:22:18.337,I wish that predicting volcanic eruptions were an exact science.
00:22:20.422,00:22:23.550,"So, we put the town on notice, and then nothing happens."
00:22:23.633,00:22:26.595,"People, we're not the only town in this state."
00:22:27.345,00:22:29.765,"All right, so are we ready to put it to vote?"
00:22:32.434,00:22:33.351,Paul.
00:22:34.436,00:22:38.356,"Everybody, this is my boss, Dr. Paul Dreyfus. Mayor Wando."
00:22:38.440,00:22:40.942,-Hi. Rachel. -It's a pleasure indeed.
00:22:41.026,00:22:42.569,"Uh, what's going on here?"
00:22:42.652,00:22:46.740,I've recommended to the council members that they put this town on alert.
00:22:46.823,00:22:48.617,They were just about to vote on it.
00:22:49.743,00:22:52.412,-Can I have a word with you outside? -Sure.
00:22:52.496,00:22:54.039,Excuse us.
00:22:57.542,00:23:01.713,"I sent you up here to have a look around, not to scare the city council."
00:23:01.797,00:23:03.673,"I know, but two people are dead."
00:23:03.757,00:23:06.510,Recommending an alert is the only responsible thing to do.
00:23:06.593,00:23:10.972,There are dozens of reasons that would account for what happened.
00:23:11.056,00:23:20.148,Anything from a mild earthquake to a slight seismic shift and not one of those reasons means that the mountain will blow up next week or next month or...
00:23:21.066,00:23:22.818,the next 100 years.
00:23:27.405,00:23:33.662,Ladies and gentlemen... I am sure that Dr. Dalton was only doing what he thought was in the town's best interests.
00:23:33.745,00:23:39.751,"However, I have learned through bitter experience that these decisions are not to be made lightly."
00:23:41.086,00:23:46.925,"Now... back in 1980, I would've bet you a million bucks that Mammoth Mountain was about to go up."
00:23:47.801,00:23:52.806,"At the U.S.G.S., we began to talk about the possibility of putting that town on alert."
00:23:52.889,00:23:57.102,"Thank God the mountain didn't go up, but the damage had already been done."
00:23:57.686,00:24:00.730,The word leaked out that the U.S.G.S. had expressed concern...
00:24:01.356,00:24:07.904,"and so the tourists panicked and stayed away, and the real estate values plummeted, and the town nearly went bankrupt."
00:24:09.156,00:24:14.744,"Consequently, I'm now a lot more cautious when it comes to even talking about putting a town on alert."
00:24:15.370,00:24:17.664,"Now, folks, understand something."
00:24:18.415,00:24:20.792,We're gonna be camped out here for as long as it takes...
00:24:21.626,00:24:26.965,with seismometers and tiltmeters that will measure and monitor every hiccup the mountain makes.
00:24:27.048,00:24:30.594,We'll be bouncing laser beams off it to track any changes in size.
00:24:31.303,00:24:33.346,We'll be analyzing gas emissions.
00:24:33.972,00:24:38.185,We've even got a robot to go up there and take its temperature.
00:24:38.268,00:24:46.776,"Now, believe me, I'm not trying to make light of your concerns, but I want you to understand that if the time comes to call for an alert..."
00:24:46.860,00:24:53.617,"If the time comes, it will be based upon scientific evidence, and not upon..."
00:24:55.994,00:24:57.078,anyone's opinion.
00:24:58.872,00:25:03.084,"For God's sake, this thing should've been handled much more discreetly."
00:25:03.168,00:25:05.587,-This meeting shouldn't have been called. -Harry.
00:25:09.382,00:25:11.092,"You're making a big mistake, Paul."
00:25:11.760,00:25:15.680,"This is an unstable system, and this town should be on alert."
00:25:15.764,00:25:18.934,You need a vacation. I'll see you in two weeks.
00:25:20.727,00:25:23.563,"Well, we got some serious damage control to do."
00:25:23.647,00:25:27.150,"If they get scared off, Rachel, you're the one who's responsible."
00:26:22.289,00:26:25.208,-How about a nice adult beverage? -Excellent.
00:26:25.292,00:26:26.876,-Good. -Sounds good to me.
00:26:31.923,00:26:33.300,Give me just a minute here.
00:26:36.177,00:26:39.097,Thought you'd be off on your fishing vacation by now.
00:26:39.180,00:26:41.433,-I decided to stick around. -I can see that.
00:26:41.516,00:26:42.684,"The question is, Why?"
00:26:43.893,00:26:45.353,Because this town's in trouble.
00:26:46.271,00:26:47.814,I'm the best man you've got.
00:26:50.191,00:26:51.234,Whiskey.
00:26:53.903,00:26:55.613,You are the best man I've got.
00:26:57.282,00:27:05.999,"But until you can understand that there are delicate politics involved, not to mention economics, you're only going to do more harm than good."
00:27:07.250,00:27:08.293,I understand.
00:27:10.545,00:27:16.760,"Tomorrow I'll hire a helicopter, fly around the mountain, take some COSPEC readings, see how much sulfur dioxide is there."
00:27:16.843,00:27:17.761,Okay.
00:27:19.137,00:27:20.722,"From now on, everything comes from me."
00:27:21.973,00:27:26.186,"Any more town meetings to be called, I'll be the one to call them. Okay?"
00:27:28.438,00:27:29.606,Okay.
00:27:58.051,00:28:00.053,"-Coffee? -Uh, yeah, please."
00:28:00.637,00:28:02.847,"Cappuccino, espresso, caffe latte?"
00:28:02.931,00:28:04.974,Could I just have a regular coffee?
00:28:05.558,00:28:06.559,Sure.
00:28:09.396,00:28:11.064,I heard you left town last night.
00:28:11.147,00:28:15.860,"Yes. Well, I've decided to stay. See what new trouble I can get myself into."
00:28:15.944,00:28:18.947,"-So, what's good here? -Everything's good here."
00:28:20.824,00:28:24.828,"-Oh, my God! I am so sorry. -No, it's okay. It's all right, I..."
00:28:29.874,00:28:31.209,I didn't do it on purpose.
00:28:33.628,00:28:37.340,I've always been better at figuring out volcanoes than people and politics.
00:28:37.424,00:28:38.633,Anyway. I just...
00:28:40.051,00:28:43.138,"wanted to say I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble, and..."
00:28:44.222,00:28:45.765,I just wanted to help.
00:28:48.017,00:28:49.394,You like eggplant parmesan?
00:28:51.187,00:28:52.272,For breakfast?
00:28:52.355,00:28:54.065,-For dinner. -Oh.
00:28:54.774,00:28:56.735,I'm inviting you over for dinner...
00:28:57.944,00:28:58.862,to say thank you.
00:28:59.612,00:29:00.947,Thanking me for what?
00:29:10.457,00:29:11.416,It's a date.
00:29:37.650,00:29:41.070,Let's go down lower and head for that rock formation over there.
00:29:41.154,00:29:43.948,"If I fly during my lunch break, I get overtime."
00:29:44.365,00:29:45.700,Just do it.
00:30:16.231,00:30:17.899,"All right, let's just hover here."
00:30:22.403,00:30:24.531,What you got back there? How's it looking?
00:30:25.532,00:30:28.493,Minimal sulfur dioxide emissions. Nothing to worry about.
00:30:30.870,00:30:32.580,We're green across the board.
00:30:33.790,00:30:37.627,"Harry, there's nothing to indicate there's any kind of activity down here."
00:30:38.628,00:30:39.838,She's quiet.
00:30:40.547,00:30:41.381,Yeah...
00:30:42.715,00:30:43.675,she's quiet.
00:30:56.437,00:30:57.730,-That one. -You've got it.
00:30:57.814,00:30:59.315,-Thank you very much. -Okay.
00:31:07.282,00:31:09.701,-Um... -Maybe Harry's tired.
00:31:11.119,00:31:12.745,Just one more. Here you go.
00:31:13.496,00:31:14.455,All right.
00:31:14.539,00:31:20.461,Look at that. No boogers. But right down in here we have a little sewing needle. You see it?
00:31:21.212,00:31:24.507,It's magic. And it needs a magic hair. This won't hurt.
00:31:25.717,00:31:28.636,"Yummy. Okay, hold this, please. Thank you."
00:31:28.720,00:31:30.263,Let me put my glasses on.
00:31:30.972,00:31:33.725,And we go...
00:31:33.808,00:31:38.271,like this. Thread it through. Fine. You hold that.
00:31:39.063,00:31:40.732,Okay? Mmm-hmm.
00:31:42.525,00:31:44.152,"-Ah, much better. -Ew!"
00:31:44.903,00:31:47.280,And we go like this.
00:31:49.073,00:31:51.200,All right. And go like that.
00:31:53.536,00:31:56.039,-It really works. -Whoa.
00:31:59.792,00:32:04.923,"Mmm. I know it's just a little town, but I couldn't imagine living anywhere else."
00:32:06.049,00:32:07.258,I grew up here.
00:32:07.800,00:32:09.385,I went to school here.
00:32:10.303,00:32:11.721,Got married here?
00:32:15.433,00:32:16.517,Brian.
00:32:22.815,00:32:25.443,I haven't heard from him in quite a while.
00:32:29.447,00:32:31.366,Quite a while. Try six years.
00:32:31.908,00:32:32.742,Hmm.
00:32:33.785,00:32:37.747,"I don't think she'd admit it, but I don't even think Ruth knows where he is."
00:32:39.374,00:32:41.292,You seem to be doing okay.
00:32:41.960,00:32:42.835,Yeah.
00:32:43.461,00:32:45.755,It was hard at first. Hard for the kids.
00:32:47.715,00:32:49.092,But we're okay.
00:32:50.927,00:32:52.178,How about you?
00:32:53.346,00:32:55.098,You ever been married?
00:32:55.181,00:32:56.349,No.
00:32:57.183,00:32:58.393,Never.
00:32:59.978,00:33:00.895,Why not?
00:33:01.896,00:33:04.273,"Well, for one thing, I move around a lot."
00:33:04.357,00:33:07.110,"Colombia, Guatemala, the Philippines..."
00:33:08.277,00:33:11.489,"Mexico, New Zealand, New Guinea."
00:33:12.532,00:33:14.826,Wherever there's a volcano with an attitude.
00:33:16.285,00:33:18.287,It makes it hard to settle down.
00:33:20.415,00:33:21.916,You ever come close?
00:33:23.668,00:33:26.170,Yes. Once.
00:33:30.508,00:33:31.926,Touchy subject.
00:33:38.349,00:33:40.018,Her name was Marianne.
00:33:41.436,00:33:42.812,We worked together.
00:33:44.897,00:33:46.607,She loved volcanoes.
00:33:47.233,00:33:49.068,Fascinated by them.
00:33:49.736,00:33:51.070,Loved the life.
00:33:54.240,00:33:58.286,"Four years ago, a volcano erupted in Colombia."
00:33:58.828,00:34:01.539,Marianne and I thought we had enough time to get out.
00:34:02.790,00:34:05.418,"Unfortunately, we were wrong."
00:34:06.377,00:34:08.296,We got too close to the show.
00:34:11.090,00:34:12.675,Marianne was killed.
00:34:17.930,00:34:19.057,If this thing blows...
00:34:21.267,00:34:23.019,and if she does a Mount Saint Helens...
00:34:24.896,00:34:26.981,the blast will get here within a minute.
00:34:29.692,00:34:32.487,"Well, I hope you're wrong about our volcano, Harry."
00:34:34.447,00:34:36.991,"But if not, I'm glad you're here."
00:34:41.954,00:34:43.372,"Hi, Harry."
00:34:46.709,00:34:49.337,"Hello. Hello, Harry."
00:34:58.262,00:35:00.932,I've found five seismometers. Where's the other three?
00:35:01.015,00:35:02.600,They're in the back of the van.
00:35:03.851,00:35:06.479,Good morning. Hi. Hello.
00:35:06.562,00:35:08.648,Hi. Hello. How are you?
00:35:08.731,00:35:11.776,"Everyone, this is Rachel Wando, the mayor of the town."
00:35:13.736,00:35:15.279,I thought you could use some coffee.
00:35:15.363,00:35:19.826,"Not knowing what you like, I brought cappuccinos, except for regular for you, right?"
00:35:19.909,00:35:21.786,That's perfect. Thank you very much.
00:35:21.869,00:35:24.163,I am jonesing. I could really use a good fix.
00:35:24.247,00:35:26.791,-What kind of coffee machine do you use? -Gaggia.
00:35:28.000,00:35:29.752,-So? -So?
00:35:29.836,00:35:30.670,So?
00:35:30.753,00:35:33.047,"You keep your beans in the freezer, right?"
00:35:33.131,00:35:35.299,"Oh, no. Never keep your beans in the freezer."
00:35:35.383,00:35:36.801,Takes all the oils out.
00:35:36.884,00:35:39.804,"You know what, Harry? This town just might be worth saving."
00:35:41.430,00:35:43.808,Mmm. Good coffee. That's good.
00:35:51.524,00:35:53.317,"Nice woman, that Rachel."
00:35:53.818,00:35:55.903,Best looking mayor I've ever seen.
00:35:55.987,00:35:58.281,-She's got my vote. -Mmm-hmm. Twice.
00:36:03.578,00:36:04.579,"Okay, Harry."
00:36:07.748,00:36:11.043,"If this mountain's gonna rock and roll, we're gonna know about it."
00:36:11.127,00:36:13.087,"So how was dinner last night, Harry?"
00:36:14.630,00:36:19.260,"Terry, why don't you just give it a break and stop trying to fix me up, eh?"
00:36:19.343,00:36:22.138,I have great taste in women. Have I ever steered you wrong?
00:36:22.972,00:36:24.140,Yeah?
00:36:25.308,00:36:27.226,-What about Astrid? -What about Astrid?
00:36:27.310,00:36:29.270,I thought you'd have a lot in common.
00:36:29.353,00:36:31.480,-She said she was into rocks. -Crystals.
00:36:31.564,00:36:34.025,Crystals! Not rocks.
00:36:34.609,00:36:35.693,Crystals.
00:36:39.780,00:36:41.407,-Mind your foot. -Whoa.
00:36:41.490,00:36:42.366,Okay.
00:36:43.201,00:36:45.411,"All right, good. I'll go get my breakfast."
00:36:46.996,00:36:48.539,You getting the hang of this thing?
00:36:48.623,00:36:51.417,"It's still kind of goosey, but I think I'm getting it."
00:36:52.501,00:36:54.587,Yes! It's coffee time.
00:36:54.670,00:36:57.298,"Coffee! Coffee, coffee, coffee!"
00:36:57.381,00:37:00.343,Cappuccino. Java. Yes!
00:37:00.426,00:37:02.261,-How are you? -Coffee. Thank you.
00:37:02.345,00:37:04.764,"-Decaf, non-fat, no sugar. -Yes."
00:37:06.140,00:37:08.267,-Macchiato. -Thank you.
00:37:08.351,00:37:10.144,-Double espresso. -Here.
00:37:10.228,00:37:11.687,"Ah, thank you, Rachel."
00:37:11.771,00:37:13.689,"Oh, thank you so much."
00:37:14.482,00:37:15.983,"So, how's it looking?"
00:37:16.067,00:37:19.987,We've been recording between 25 and 75 earthquakes per day.
00:37:20.071,00:37:21.197,You're kidding!
00:37:21.280,00:37:23.991,"Don't worry, they're microquakes. They happen all the time."
00:37:24.075,00:37:26.118,"Oh. Well, good."
00:37:27.036,00:37:28.788,And what's this?
00:37:28.871,00:37:30.957,This little puppy's called Spider Legs.
00:37:31.040,00:37:33.251,She goes in when it's too dangerous for us.
00:37:33.334,00:37:35.503,"Boldly goes, I might add."
00:37:35.586,00:37:38.089,"Actually, we'll take gas readings up front."
00:37:38.172,00:37:41.509,"Then, we'll send video back here to home base."
00:37:41.592,00:37:42.635,Hopefully.
00:37:44.553,00:37:47.556,Good. Now try to keep the weight on that one.
00:37:49.475,00:37:51.769,See what I'm saying? Keep the weight on this...
00:37:51.852,00:37:53.688,That's not me. That's not in here.
00:37:53.771,00:37:55.314,The other one isn't moving?
00:38:01.696,00:38:04.824,-What's the problem now? -There's no problem.
00:38:05.783,00:38:08.911,"If this keeps screwing up, I don't want to take it up there."
00:38:08.995,00:38:10.955,"Paul, the problem is ELF here."
00:38:12.039,00:38:15.293,"I'm going to fix this once and for all. Everybody, turn around."
00:38:15.376,00:38:16.585,Turn around.
00:38:22.800,00:38:25.886,Just be sure to put the thing back on before NASA finds out.
00:38:25.970,00:38:27.346,It'll be our little secret.
00:38:28.055,00:38:30.391,"So, big guy? Ready to see the sights?"
00:38:30.474,00:38:32.977,Yeah. Big boy's definitely ready to see the sights.
00:38:51.787,00:38:54.040,I expect apologies and six-packs from each of you.
00:38:55.583,00:38:58.336,You want a medal because you got it to work okay?
00:39:00.671,00:39:02.381,It's working beautifully.
00:39:03.132,00:39:05.926,It ought to be working better. It lost 15 pounds of ugly fat.
00:39:06.010,00:39:08.679,-Zoom in to the left. -Zooming in.
00:39:09.263,00:39:12.725,We got some minor geothermal activity there on the edge of the crater.
00:39:13.517,00:39:15.019,Pan to the right a little bit.
00:39:15.102,00:39:17.229,I want to have a look at the lava dome.
00:39:22.943,00:39:24.236,Oops.
00:39:28.491,00:39:31.994,Terry's masterpiece is a piece of junk. Show me the leg that isn't working.
00:39:35.998,00:39:37.750,"Yeah, we copy. You have a problem."
00:39:37.833,00:39:40.086,Let's just throw rocks at the goddamn thing.
00:39:40.169,00:39:43.631,I think I'll go down there and give it the personal touch.
00:39:59.021,00:39:59.939,You all right?
00:40:00.022,00:40:01.774,-You got me? -I got you.
00:40:02.525,00:40:03.526,Here we go.
00:40:06.404,00:40:08.155,Terry's going down. Do you hear me?
00:40:08.239,00:40:09.740,You're coming in crystal clear.
00:40:30.052,00:40:36.559,"Terry, why don't we just forget Spider Legs for now and get your backside back up here, okay?"
00:40:36.642,00:40:46.068,"Not a chance. For the $450,000 we put into this beast, it ought to be able to stand on its head, split the atom, and fart The Star-Spangled Banner."
00:41:03.252,00:41:06.213,That's his answer to everything. Kick it if it doesn't work.
00:41:06.297,00:41:07.756,"Get your ass back up, now."
00:41:08.424,00:41:09.967,Not a chance. I'm going off rope.
00:41:10.050,00:41:13.929,"No, Terry. That's not a great idea."
00:41:14.013,00:41:15.973,It's okay. I can get this thing going.
00:41:17.266,00:41:21.979,"But I tell you, I would swear this thing's purposefully trying to piss me off!"
00:41:22.480,00:41:24.356,"You know what, Harry?"
00:41:24.440,00:41:25.649,It's working.
00:41:35.618,00:41:37.119,There's some seismic activity.
00:41:39.288,00:41:40.456,"All right, here we go."
00:41:42.082,00:41:45.127,"They're minor quakes, but they're right in the middle of it."
00:41:46.003,00:41:48.172,We should tell them to call it a day.
00:41:50.466,00:41:52.051,I didn't get you. Say it again.
00:41:59.642,00:42:00.768,"Oh, my God!"
00:42:12.613,00:42:14.198,"Terry! Terry, can you hear us?"
00:42:14.281,00:42:15.157,Terry!
00:42:28.337,00:42:30.714,It's okay. It's okay.
00:42:36.512,00:42:39.265,"-Paul, come in. -We can hear you. Go ahead."
00:42:41.100,00:42:43.727,"He's got a broken leg, by the looks of it here."
00:42:43.811,00:42:46.480,We need the chopper down here fast. Do you hear me?
00:42:46.564,00:42:50.025,We copy. Terry broke his leg. We're sending chopper right away.
00:42:50.109,00:42:51.277,They're sending the chopper.
00:42:51.360,00:42:54.363,I can't believe the camera's still working after all that.
00:43:04.748,00:43:05.916,Look...
00:43:06.041,00:43:07.876,"All right, hang on a second, okay?"
00:43:07.960,00:43:11.338,"Paul, the son-of-a-bitch pilot wants to renegotiate his rate."
00:43:13.090,00:43:14.466,Give him whatever he wants.
00:43:19.763,00:43:23.142,This is rescue chopper. We're coming up to the rim of the crater.
00:43:24.018,00:43:25.936,Do you have a visual on us?
00:43:26.729,00:43:30.274,"We're just below you, about 600 feet down off the south face."
00:43:30.899,00:43:32.443,"All right, I see you."
00:43:32.526,00:43:37.615,We'll go around again and try to drop you a cable and then hoist you out of there. You got that?
00:43:45.789,00:43:46.999,He looks in bad shape.
00:44:10.147,00:44:13.525,-You on? -Okay! Let it go!
00:44:16.111,00:44:18.781,"All right, go, go, go! Now!"
00:44:35.047,00:44:36.090,"Great job, Harry."
00:44:36.173,00:44:39.843,"I don't want to talk out of turn, but you should put this town on alert."
00:44:39.927,00:44:41.637,There's a lot of activity up there.
00:44:41.720,00:44:45.974,"I know it was intense, but I don't want to cause a panic over minor tectonic quakes."
00:44:46.058,00:44:48.435,-Minor? -The biggest one we measured was 2.9...
00:44:48.519,00:44:50.312,I don't give a damn if it was 1.1...
00:44:50.396,00:44:54.024,Those quakes were shallow. Damn shallow. I was up there. I felt them.
00:44:54.108,00:44:57.736,They weren't tectonic. They were magmatic. This thing is going to blow.
00:44:57.820,00:45:02.699,I'm warning you. I'm not going to have my people scaring everyone because of guesswork and hunches!
00:45:03.409,00:45:06.453,"Another 48 hours will tell the tale. You, get a grip."
00:45:09.164,00:45:10.582,That son of a bitch.
00:45:12.876,00:45:14.211,I'm okay.
00:45:15.838,00:45:19.091,My doc says I can leave as soon as they make sure my head's okay.
00:45:21.927,00:45:22.970,Ow. Ow.
00:45:23.053,00:45:27.850,I think Spider Legs was just getting even with you for all the kicks in the butt you gave him.
00:45:27.933,00:45:29.852,"We got a problem here, guys."
00:45:30.727,00:45:33.856,I'll need your help to convince Paul that this mountain means business.
00:45:33.939,00:45:39.570,"Well, Harry, I hate to agree with Paul, but there's no real evidence to suggest that anything weird is going on up there."
00:45:39.653,00:45:41.530,Just like Mount Baker back in the '70s.
00:45:41.613,00:45:43.365,There was no eruption then.
00:45:45.033,00:45:50.289,"My ninth grade science teacher once told me that if you put a frog in boiling water, it'll jump right out."
00:45:50.372,00:45:54.835,But if you put it in cold water and heat it up gradually...
00:45:55.627,00:45:58.464,it'll just sit there and slowly boil to death.
00:45:58.547,00:46:01.258,"What's that, Harry, your recipe for frog soup?"
00:46:02.468,00:46:04.803,It's my recipe for disaster.
00:46:05.387,00:46:10.225,"If we got here today, we'd know we were in hot water and we'd put this town on alert."
00:46:11.018,00:46:13.312,Take a look. The seismic activity is nil.
00:46:13.395,00:46:16.315,Steady as a rock. And take a look over here.
00:46:16.398,00:46:18.150,A whole lot of nothing.
00:46:18.233,00:46:21.236,It's been like that all week. There is nothing happening.
00:46:23.322,00:46:26.408,The tiltmeters don't show any change in the mountain's shape.
00:46:26.492,00:46:29.119,I think we've seen all this big baby's going to do.
00:46:29.244,00:46:32.247,We got the mountain wired. We got our equipment in place.
00:46:32.331,00:46:34.958,We can keep an eye on things from home base from now on.
00:46:35.083,00:46:36.502,Our work here is finished.
00:46:36.585,00:46:38.545,We've seen lulls like this in activity before.
00:46:38.629,00:46:41.548,"If we're wise, we'll give it a couple of days."
00:46:41.632,00:46:44.927,I promised you two days. I gave it a week.
00:46:45.010,00:46:47.554,"First thing in the morning, we are out of here."
00:46:58.440,00:47:00.776,"-Keep the change. -Okay, Elliot."
00:47:17.709,00:47:20.170,"All right. What've we got here, ten bucks?"
00:47:20.295,00:47:22.172,-That's 20 bucks. -Twenty bucks.
00:47:31.723,00:47:33.559,"Give us a beer there, Charlie."
00:47:34.893,00:47:38.897,So... you ever get to Portland?
00:47:40.482,00:47:42.901,No. I'm busy.
00:47:44.528,00:47:46.863,Busy? What do you do for fun?
00:47:47.906,00:47:50.617,"Fun? Hmm. What is that, fun?"
00:47:50.701,00:47:51.952,"Oh, I know."
00:47:52.035,00:47:56.790,"Fun is what you have when you don't have two children, a business, and a town to run."
00:47:56.873,00:47:59.543,"-I got you. -Excuse me, Harry."
00:47:59.626,00:48:03.630,"Before we took off, I just wanted to say thanks for all the hospitality."
00:48:06.049,00:48:10.262,"That's nice of you to say that, but I'm sure you're not that sorry to see us go."
00:48:10.345,00:48:13.307,"Our presence here is bad for business, right, Paul?"
00:48:20.272,00:48:25.152,"Well, it's late and I have to let my babysitter get home."
00:48:25.235,00:48:26.820,I'll walk you.
00:48:27.654,00:48:30.741,"-Let me get my jacket. -Hey, Harry, it's your break."
00:48:31.700,00:48:33.285,"It's your game, guys."
00:48:44.254,00:48:46.298,I wish you weren't leaving.
00:48:46.381,00:48:51.887,"Well, don't worry, Dreyfus was right. I guess we don't really have to be here."
00:48:53.639,00:48:56.016,We can watch this mountain from Portland.
00:48:58.310,00:49:00.354,I still wish you weren't leaving.
00:49:11.448,00:49:13.033,"Hey, you two."
00:49:17.329,00:49:18.372,Jane Fox.
00:49:19.414,00:49:22.417,That'll give her something to talk about for a couple of weeks.
00:49:29.424,00:49:30.592,-Hi. -Hi.
00:49:30.676,00:49:32.928,"-Are they sleeping? -Yeah, they sure are."
00:49:33.011,00:49:34.554,-I'll walk you out. -Okay.
00:49:34.638,00:49:35.889,-Be right back. -Okay.
00:49:35.972,00:49:37.432,-Good night. -Good night.
00:49:44.523,00:49:46.608,-You free on Saturday? -Saturday's fine.
00:49:46.692,00:49:48.568,"-Good. I'll call you. -Okay, bye."
00:50:00.914,00:50:04.418,"No, Rachel, no. I don't want any coffee."
00:50:04.501,00:50:06.086,Thanks.
00:50:06.169,00:50:08.714,I really think I should make us some coffee.
00:50:09.548,00:50:11.466,I don't know how to tell you this...
00:50:13.427,00:50:15.887,but I've never really cared for your coffee.
00:50:30.819,00:50:33.405,I haven't been with anybody in a long time.
00:50:33.488,00:50:35.115,Same here.
00:50:38.243,00:50:40.120,But you know what they say.
00:50:40.912,00:50:42.706,It's like riding a bicycle.
00:50:43.957,00:50:47.544,"Once you've learned, you never forget."
00:50:53.341,00:50:55.051,"Yeah, Lauren, what is it?"
00:50:55.135,00:50:56.887,I'm thirsty.
00:50:56.970,00:50:58.180,"Okay, honey."
00:51:00.474,00:51:02.809,I think she'll go right back to sleep.
00:51:07.147,00:51:08.148,Ugh!
00:51:09.566,00:51:11.193,What's wrong with the water?
00:51:12.903,00:51:14.446,Must be a broken pipe?
00:51:18.950,00:51:21.536,-Where's the town's water supply? -Why?
00:51:22.579,00:51:23.914,Graham.
00:51:23.997,00:51:26.291,-Wake up. -Go away.
00:51:52.692,00:51:55.821,What's that smell? It smells like sulfur.
00:51:57.239,00:52:00.116,Yeah. Ugh! Sulfur dioxide.
00:52:00.200,00:52:03.995,I saw the same thing in the Philippines on Mount Pinatubo before she blew.
00:52:05.372,00:52:08.792,"This mountain is a ticking bomb. Come on, let's go."
00:52:25.183,00:52:27.394,I've got that scientific evidence you need.
00:52:27.477,00:52:29.062,"Harry, what are you doing here?"
00:52:31.481,00:52:34.025,I've just come from the town's water supply.
00:52:37.195,00:52:38.113,It's the same.
00:52:40.115,00:52:41.157,"Oh, my God."
00:52:41.867,00:52:45.412,The quakes are beginning to swarm. Got a 2.4.
00:52:53.461,00:52:54.671,"Yes, sir."
00:52:55.255,00:52:57.132,"All right, thanks. I appreciate it."
00:52:57.215,00:52:59.676,The National Guard can't be here until tomorrow.
00:52:59.759,00:53:01.636,How much time do you think we've got?
00:53:01.720,00:53:03.597,Don't know. It's too early to tell.
00:53:03.680,00:53:07.684,Call the mayor. Have her put the town on alert. I'll call the FAA.
00:53:07.767,00:53:09.144,Okay.
00:53:14.941,00:53:16.359,Here we go.
00:53:17.402,00:53:26.661,"In response to the potential volcanic threat to Dante's Peak, I am requesting that all residents attend a public meeting at the high school at 6:00 p.m."
00:53:26.745,00:53:29.080,to discuss the evacuation of our town.
00:53:29.164,00:53:35.545,A representative of the United States Geological Survey will be on hand to explain the facts to you in detail.
00:53:37.339,00:53:40.550,When is the mountain going to blow? Tonight? Tomorrow?
00:53:40.634,00:53:44.596,"Whoa, take it easy, now. There is no need to be alarmed yet."
00:53:44.679,00:53:47.974,-What's this meeting? -All they want to do is be prepared...
00:53:52.854,00:53:57.025,There will be a meeting held at the high school gymnasium at 6:00 p.m.
00:53:57.108,00:53:59.611,to discuss the evacuation of Dante's Peak.
00:53:59.694,00:54:05.867,To repeat: all citizens are urged to attend the meeting that will be held at the high school gymnasium...
00:54:05.951,00:54:09.204,"Ruth, just listen to me this one time."
00:54:09.287,00:54:13.375,Harry says the mountain could blow any minute and you've got to come down.
00:54:14.125,00:54:15.835,Let me try.
00:54:15.919,00:54:17.963,Ruth? Hi. Harry Dalton here.
00:54:18.046,00:54:20.382,This is a very serious situation we've got here.
00:54:27.889,00:54:29.265,Hung up.
00:54:30.266,00:54:33.103,"Stupid, stupid woman."
00:54:39.401,00:54:40.485,We got to go.
00:54:40.568,00:54:42.862,"-Pick up, Ruth. -She's not coming down, is she?"
00:54:47.951,00:54:52.288,"Look, if Grandma wants to stay up there, there's nothing we can do about it."
00:54:52.372,00:54:55.125,"-But, Mom... -No buts. It's her decision."
00:54:55.208,00:54:57.585,I need you guys to pack while we're gone.
00:54:57.669,00:55:00.171,"One suitcase apiece, okay? Be responsible."
00:55:00.255,00:55:01.464,We'll be back soon.
00:55:01.548,00:55:03.425,Let's try her again.
00:55:08.138,00:55:10.265,"Come on, Grandma, pick up."
00:55:11.725,00:55:14.310,-She's not answering. -Give it to me.
00:55:14.394,00:55:15.603,Hello?
00:55:20.025,00:55:23.111,"Do we have to wait? I mean, if we want to leave now?"
00:55:26.823,00:55:30.243,"Okay, listen, I know it's tough to think about leaving our homes."
00:55:30.326,00:55:33.747,"But, clearly, it's the most responsible thing to do right now."
00:55:33.830,00:55:37.542,Quite likely nothing will happen. But it's better to be safe than sorry.
00:55:37.625,00:55:43.465,"I want you to remember, no one should leave tonight without a copy of the town's emergency evacuation plan."
00:55:43.548,00:55:46.301,They will be handed out at the door on your way out.
00:55:46.384,00:55:49.179,I'd like to turn the floor over now to Dr. Harry Dalton.
00:55:49.262,00:55:51.848,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, first of all..."
00:55:51.931,00:55:55.185,"It's all over, Les. I'm out of here before it all hits the fan."
00:55:57.479,00:56:01.483,I would like to underline that these are just precautionary measures.
00:56:01.566,00:56:04.110,"Um, we don't want to start a panic..."
00:56:05.695,00:56:06.905,Did anybody feel that?
00:56:07.989,00:56:11.034,"Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm. Please just stay..."
00:56:19.417,00:56:20.460,I felt that.
00:56:22.796,00:56:25.590,Don't push. Please stay calm.
00:56:25.673,00:56:27.967,Do not rush.
00:56:28.051,00:56:31.471,Go toward the exits. Don't panic. Do not push.
00:56:57.080,00:56:58.248,Please.
00:57:02.043,00:57:03.545,Don't push!
00:57:04.921,00:57:06.131,It's okay. Please.
00:57:06.923,00:57:08.883,You okay? You all right?
00:57:12.762,00:57:13.930,"Stan, look at this."
00:57:14.013,00:57:16.724,Why look at computers when you can see the real thing?
00:57:20.019,00:57:22.063,Looks like it's about to blow its top.
00:57:29.320,00:57:31.072,This is not good.
00:57:48.173,00:57:49.174,I've got to get the kids.
00:58:10.612,00:58:11.738,Watch out.
00:58:20.205,00:58:21.331,"Paul, come in."
00:58:22.749,00:58:25.376,Paul? Can anybody hear me? Paul?
00:58:26.211,00:58:28.046,"-Paul, come in. -Look at that."
00:58:31.674,00:58:33.635,Paul? Can anybody hear me? Come in.
00:58:33.718,00:58:36.387,"Harry, we hear you. Where are you?"
00:58:36.471,00:58:41.434,"I'm heading up to get Rachel's kids. Once I've done that, I'll come and help you pack out of there."
00:58:41.518,00:58:45.313,"Harry, listen. For whatever it's worth, you were right and I was wrong."
00:58:46.189,00:58:47.106,I'm sorry.
00:58:47.190,00:58:49.859,It's okay. I'll see you later.
00:58:52.237,00:58:54.531,She's blowing. She's going.
00:58:56.157,00:58:57.242,Look ahead.
00:59:57.218,00:59:58.511,Look out. Jesus.
01:00:02.557,01:00:03.600,Shit!
01:00:05.560,01:00:07.228,Make a right. Go down the alley.
01:00:43.139,01:00:44.766,"Come on, come on."
01:01:27.892,01:01:29.268,"Harry, my truck's not there."
01:01:33.648,01:01:34.774,Graham!
01:01:36.442,01:01:37.360,Lauren!
01:01:41.239,01:01:42.365,Put on your seat belt.
01:01:45.827,01:01:48.287,-You know how to do all the gears? -Yeah.
01:01:48.705,01:01:50.540,Graham? Lauren?
01:01:55.169,01:01:58.673,"-Oh, dear God. They went up the mountain. -Come on, let's go."
01:02:06.389,01:02:08.599,-Any other way across that bridge? -No.
01:02:19.026,01:02:21.904,"You're out of your mind. Oh, you're out of your mind!"
01:02:21.988,01:02:22.947,It's okay.
01:02:28.953,01:02:30.913,"-Harry. -Okay, hang on."
01:02:36.794,01:02:39.255,-It's okay. -There's a lot of water coming in.
01:02:39.338,01:02:41.716,This rig can take it. The engine's got a snorkel.
01:02:56.606,01:02:58.191,Look at those cars.
01:03:08.075,01:03:09.452,-We're stuck? -I know.
01:03:24.258,01:03:26.427,Harry? See that car coming at us?
01:03:56.040,01:03:57.083,Jesus.
01:04:10.888,01:04:12.098,They are on.
01:04:12.181,01:04:15.226,-Can you make the wipers go faster? -I don't know how.
01:04:19.063,01:04:21.023,Don't touch it. You'll mess something up.
01:04:21.107,01:04:23.150,-Like what? -I don't know. Something.
01:04:23.234,01:04:25.611,Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
01:04:52.305,01:04:56.142,Uh-oh. Looks like our asshole pilot plans on flying people out of here.
01:04:56.225,01:04:59.228,"If he gets any of that ash sucked up into his engine, he's had it."
01:05:08.112,01:05:10.615,"He's getting fifteen thousand bucks, cold cash."
01:05:12.575,01:05:14.243,"Wait, wait!"
01:05:15.119,01:05:17.455,"No, no. Wait! Wait!"
01:05:18.623,01:05:20.333,Stop! Stop!
01:06:02.416,01:06:03.334,Where are we?
01:06:05.252,01:06:07.171,"Rachel, where are we?"
01:06:07.254,01:06:08.881,"Uh, top of Exeter."
01:06:08.965,01:06:10.299,Greg? Stan?
01:06:12.885,01:06:15.137,There's a chopper down. Send the fire services.
01:06:15.221,01:06:17.098,"Jesus! Okay, Harry."
01:06:18.140,01:06:20.267,There's nothing we can do. We got to get your kids.
01:06:21.060,01:06:23.729,"-Okay. -Greg, come in. It's Harry."
01:06:23.813,01:06:26.857,Rachel's kids have gone up the mountain. We're gonna get them.
01:06:26.941,01:06:31.112,-He's crazy. There's not enough time. -You don't have enough time. Copy that?
01:06:31.195,01:06:33.197,We do not think you have enough time.
01:06:50.297,01:06:51.632,What are you doing here?
01:06:58.973,01:07:00.224,Your mama's gonna kill you.
01:07:27.543,01:07:29.545,How are they going to get through this?
01:07:53.903,01:07:56.614,"Oh, God. The road's gone."
01:07:57.615,01:07:58.532,It's gone.
01:08:22.056,01:08:23.390,Lauren!
01:08:38.572,01:08:40.032,"It was my idea, too."
01:08:41.325,01:08:43.369,I'm so mad at you.
01:08:55.131,01:08:57.299,Stop looking at me like it's my fault.
01:09:00.427,01:09:04.181,"We would if we could, but a landslide has wiped out the entire road behind us."
01:09:04.265,01:09:05.641,What?
01:09:08.853,01:09:11.605,We've had lots of minor eruptions. Maybe we're over the hump.
01:09:11.689,01:09:13.440,"-Yeah, I hope. -Get real, Beavis."
01:09:13.524,01:09:16.610,She's just clearing her throat. She hasn't started to sing yet.
01:09:27.163,01:09:28.497,We hear you. Where are you?
01:09:28.581,01:09:32.126,"We're at Mirror Lake, at the lodge. The road's down, but we're okay."
01:09:34.295,01:09:36.881,I'll send a helicopter when the ash clouds clear.
01:09:36.964,01:09:39.300,"Get out of there before it's too late, okay?"
01:09:39.383,01:09:40.885,Don't wait for us.
01:09:40.968,01:09:42.887,"Harry, you're breaking up. Say again."
01:09:46.557,01:09:48.642,"Get out of there now, please."
01:09:49.852,01:09:52.229,"-Harry, are you there? -Maybe his battery's dead."
01:09:55.983,01:09:59.653,"I've decided I'll stay as long as I can, but I want you to leave right now."
01:10:02.198,01:10:05.409,"No way, we're not walking out on God's big show, right?"
01:10:05.492,01:10:06.702,Not a chance.
01:10:08.162,01:10:10.456,"This mountain will never hurt us, believe me."
01:10:10.539,01:10:12.750,"You're such a fool, Ruth. Come on."
01:10:23.844,01:10:26.096,This was taken the summer we built this place.
01:10:26.180,01:10:27.806,Brian was six months old.
01:10:27.890,01:10:30.392,"There's no time for a trip down memory lane, Ruth."
01:10:30.476,01:10:32.811,"Rachel, Ruth, come on. We've got to go."
01:10:32.895,01:10:35.105,"Have you got everything? Okay, children, let's go."
01:11:12.393,01:11:13.519,Roughy!
01:11:17.773,01:11:19.108,Roughy!
01:11:37.835,01:11:40.004,"Mom, the fish... They're all dead."
01:11:58.147,01:12:00.399,Graham! Don't touch the water.
01:12:00.482,01:12:04.069,"Lauren, come sit over here, sweetie. That's it, sweetheart."
01:12:04.153,01:12:05.779,"Everybody, put your feet up."
01:12:08.240,01:12:09.950,"Ruth, put your feet up, please."
01:12:10.617,01:12:12.703,Volcanic activity has turned the lake into acid.
01:12:19.877,01:12:22.087,-Acid eats metal. -Mmm-hmm.
01:12:23.297,01:12:25.758,"-Is the boat going to sink? -No, sugar."
01:12:25.841,01:12:27.384,"No, it's not going to sink."
01:12:34.141,01:12:38.187,"Hey, if you're scared, you can have my crystal."
01:12:41.523,01:12:43.567,-I can have it? -Yeah.
01:12:50.032,01:13:47.756,"Row, row, row your boat Gently down the stream Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily Life is but a dream Row, row, row your boat Gently down the stream Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily Life is but a dream Oh, shit."
01:13:53.595,01:13:55.889,-We've lost the prop. -No.
01:13:55.973,01:13:57.099,We've lost the prop.
01:13:59.393,01:14:00.853,"Okay, don't worry."
01:14:00.936,01:14:03.689,Go up there with Grandma. There's a good girl.
01:14:11.613,01:14:14.116,"Graham, move over there and keep the boat balanced."
01:14:26.753,01:14:29.006,It's okay. Keep trying.
01:14:31.467,01:14:33.594,"No, it's not going to sink, sweetie."
01:14:40.684,01:14:42.519,We're sinking!
01:15:06.710,01:15:08.378,"Ruth, get in!"
01:15:33.320,01:15:34.363,You're okay.
01:15:41.995,01:15:44.122,"Kids, just give us some room here."
01:15:44.206,01:15:45.666,Grandma.
01:15:47.417,01:15:49.336,Take your sister. There's a good boy.
01:15:50.087,01:15:52.256,-There's a good boy. -Take care of Lauren.
01:15:55.842,01:15:57.970,"-Oh, God. -Look at her legs."
01:16:01.348,01:16:03.433,"We're going to get you down from here, okay?"
01:16:05.352,01:16:06.853,-I want to help. -It's okay.
01:16:22.828,01:16:23.787,"Oh, God."
01:16:50.564,01:16:52.149,You're a sight for sore eyes.
01:16:52.232,01:16:56.236,"Lieutenant, take your men and sweep every building in town, top to bottom."
01:16:56.320,01:16:57.738,Everybody out! Go!
01:16:57.821,01:17:01.116,Get them on the truck and get them out. This thing's going to blow.
01:17:07.080,01:17:08.957,"Stop, please stop."
01:17:09.583,01:17:11.585,Please stop.
01:17:22.137,01:17:24.473,"Hang on, Ruth. You're going to be okay."
01:17:26.350,01:17:27.351,Hold on.
01:17:27.434,01:17:30.020,"Here, Grandma, have my crystal."
01:17:30.103,01:17:35.442,"Oh, ladybug, that's so nice, but you keep it for your luck, okay?"
01:17:35.942,01:17:37.027,Okay.
01:17:44.159,01:17:46.411,I'm so sorry for what I said to you up there.
01:17:46.495,01:17:48.705,I really didn't mean it. I just...
01:17:48.789,01:17:50.666,"You were right, what you said."
01:17:50.791,01:17:53.210,"-I am a fool. -No, you're not."
01:17:54.795,01:17:56.797,My son's the biggest fool of all.
01:17:57.339,01:18:00.300,He never should have run off and hurt you all like that.
01:18:03.345,01:18:09.601,"If anybody's a fool, Ruth, it's me because I don't think I ever really gave you a chance."
01:18:10.644,01:18:14.398,"Hang on, Grandma. It's just two miles to the ranger station."
01:18:14.481,01:18:17.401,"I don't think I have another two miles left in me, ace."
01:18:17.484,01:18:19.152,"Yes, Grandma, please."
01:18:19.236,01:18:20.570,It's okay.
01:18:22.531,01:18:25.575,-I get to stay on my mountain. -No...
01:18:32.207,01:18:33.208,Grandma.
01:18:36.962,01:18:38.130,Ruth.
01:19:08.493,01:19:10.662,I got the van. You go with these fellows.
01:19:10.746,01:19:13.540,"Harry, I don't know whether you can hear me. It's Paul."
01:19:13.623,01:19:16.126,"Harry, the bridge is about to go."
01:19:16.209,01:19:17.461,We got everybody out.
01:19:17.544,01:19:19.045,We got everyone.
01:19:19.838,01:19:22.215,"Take care, Harry. Take great care."
01:21:50.280,01:21:51.323,Dreyfus!
01:21:57.537,01:21:58.413,"Come on, come on."
01:22:05.170,01:22:07.297,"Paul! Come on, get out!"
01:22:16.389,01:22:17.265,Get out!
01:22:23.897,01:22:26.232,-Jump! You got to jump! -Jump!
01:22:32.739,01:22:34.449,"-Hey, Paul! -Paul!"
01:22:49.798,01:22:52.759,-Move. Come on. -We're running out of time. Let's go.
01:22:58.139,01:22:58.974,Hurry!
01:23:11.069,01:23:14.280,Great. Just great.
01:23:17.867,01:23:19.160,I don't know.
01:23:19.244,01:23:21.705,"-Kids, why don't you get in the back? -Okay."
01:23:35.510,01:23:36.386,Here we go.
01:23:54.529,01:23:56.448,-We're on fire. -The truck's on fire!
01:24:20.847,01:24:22.098,Mommy!
01:24:28.772,01:24:30.023,Come on!
01:24:34.819,01:24:36.988,"Yes, yes! Move, move!"
01:24:51.544,01:24:52.545,Roughy!
01:24:52.629,01:24:54.672,We're only going to get one chance at this.
01:25:02.222,01:25:04.307,-Yes! -Roughy!
01:25:21.658,01:25:24.744,Eight years it took us to get this town on its feet.
01:25:25.537,01:25:27.288,You wouldn't believe the struggle.
01:25:30.041,01:25:31.209,Look at it.
01:27:00.340,01:27:01.382,"Oh, my God."
01:27:02.800,01:27:03.676,Wait.
01:27:16.731,01:27:19.234,-What do we need this for? -It might come in handy.
01:27:57.772,01:27:59.899,That is a pyroclastic cloud.
01:28:18.209,01:28:19.127,Mom!
01:28:48.614,01:28:51.034,"My God. Get down, kids!"
01:29:20.146,01:29:21.189,"Oh, my God."
01:29:33.576,01:29:35.620,"-So long, Harry. -Oh, no."
01:29:36.079,01:29:36.996,So long.
01:29:51.594,01:29:53.221,Graham? Talk to me.
01:29:54.055,01:29:57.391,"We've got to get out of here, all right? Can you do it?"
01:30:05.108,01:30:06.943,Okay. All right.
01:30:31.634,01:30:32.677,Roughy!
01:30:39.559,01:30:43.062,"Um, I have some chips and crackers and drinks back here."
01:30:47.316,01:30:51.320,"-My head hurts. -I know, baby, so does mine."
01:30:51.404,01:30:54.949,"Oh, no, I forgot ELF. I left it in the truck."
01:30:55.032,01:30:58.286,-What do you need that for? -It's a transmitter designed by NASA.
01:30:58.369,01:31:00.163,We were testing it for them.
01:31:00.246,01:31:04.333,I was hoping it would send a signal so people would realize we were down here.
01:31:04.417,01:31:06.294,I'm going to go get it. Stay here.
01:31:09.005,01:31:10.339,What if you get lost?
01:31:10.423,01:31:13.718,"Graham, just stay here, okay? Look after your sister and mother."
01:31:14.260,01:31:15.595,"We're not gonna get out, are we?"
01:31:18.639,01:31:21.350,"Yes, we are, baby. Yes, we are."
01:31:24.520,01:31:28.357,Come here. Just sit down a second.
01:31:29.609,01:31:32.236,"All right, listen."
01:31:33.571,01:31:35.740,Have you ever been deep-sea fishing?
01:31:36.407,01:31:37.491,No.
01:31:37.992,01:31:58.095,"Good. Neither have I. So, when we get out of here, and we will get out of here, what do you say we go down to Florida, we get ourselves a boat, and we stock it with all the nicest, yummiest things we can get our hands on, and we go out there and catch ourselves a big, old, fat fish?"
01:31:58.763,01:32:01.057,Hmm? Does that sound good?
01:32:04.310,01:32:05.770,"It sounds good, Harry."
01:32:09.106,01:32:12.485,"Okay, stay here. I'll be back in a flash."
01:32:13.194,01:32:14.862,Chins up. Okay.
01:32:17.406,01:32:21.577,"Graham, you think you could find some rope so we could tie up Roughy?"
01:32:27.250,01:32:30.044,And maybe some water so we can clean these cuts up.
01:32:45.726,01:32:46.602,Rachel!
01:32:48.771,01:32:50.147,Rachel!
01:32:55.945,01:32:57.530,Rachel!
01:33:02.201,01:33:03.244,Shit!
01:36:33.537,01:36:34.997,-Frank? -Yeah?
01:36:35.080,01:36:36.665,How long has this light been blinking?
01:36:42.379,01:36:47.218,"Thank you, NASA. Thank you, NASA! Thank you, NASA!"
01:36:47.927,01:36:50.638,"All right, we're gonna get you out now. You're all set."
01:37:47.778,01:37:50.698,We thought you were toast! Are we glad to see you alive!
01:37:51.782,01:37:54.577,-Rachel and the kids are still there. -Good to see you.
01:37:54.660,01:37:57.413,"When that signal went off, I nearly fell off my chair."
01:37:57.496,01:37:59.832,"He started screaming, Thank you, NASA!"
01:37:59.915,01:38:01.959,-The old tin box worked. -It sure did.
01:38:02.042,01:38:04.712,Rachel and the children are still there. Where's Paul?
01:38:05.838,01:38:07.006,He didn't make it.
01:38:09.258,01:38:11.260,At least he got to see the show.
01:38:55.721,01:38:57.848,Keep clear. Look out!
01:39:02.728,01:39:05.731,We have survivors back here. Get out of the way!
01:39:18.410,01:39:19.620,Graham!
01:39:20.454,01:39:22.373,"Mom, it's Harry! He's alive!"
01:40:04.164,01:40:07.668,Did you really mean what you said about taking us fishing?
01:40:07.751,01:40:09.670,-Sure did. -That's great.
01:40:17.803,01:40:20.556,-You guys ready to go? -Let's go.
