00:18:19.933,00:18:21.392,He's an SS.
00:18:21.434,00:18:23.352,You kill every last one you can.
00:18:23.394,00:18:25.605,Fuck every last one.
00:18:25.646,00:18:27.023,We finishing it.
00:18:27.065,00:18:28.232,Done much killing?
00:18:28.900,00:18:29.984,No.
00:18:30.026,00:18:31.151,You will.
00:18:31.193,00:18:33.320,"Boys, take him through that gun."
00:18:33.362,00:18:35.197,Wh-What do I do with this?
00:18:35.239,00:18:36.407,Take a look at it.
00:18:36.449,00:18:37.617,See that cover?
00:18:37.658,00:18:38.910,Open it.
00:18:38.952,00:18:40.202,And now you killing.
00:18:40.244,00:18:41.913,Close it up.
00:18:41.955,00:18:43.247,Now you ain't.
00:18:46.417,00:18:47.961,Main unit's punching east.
00:18:48.002,00:18:51.297,We are going north on a flank guard mission.
00:18:51.338,00:18:54.341,We'll tie up with Baker Company from the 41st.
00:18:54.383,00:18:56.677,Sergeant Collier's with us now.
00:18:56.719,00:18:58.512,He'll be acting platoon sergeant.
00:18:58.554,00:18:59.680,Fine by me.
00:18:59.722,00:19:01.557,"Good to have you, Don."
00:19:06.813,00:19:08.773,We're meeting Baker Company here.
00:19:08.815,00:19:11.859,"Then, together we'll take this town."
00:19:11.901,00:19:14.862,"After that, we're working for Captain Waggoner."
00:19:14.904,00:19:16.489,Any questions?
00:19:16.530,00:19:18.032,I got one question.
00:19:18.074,00:19:19.742,Peterson?
00:19:19.784,00:19:21.243,"I'm Binkowski, sir."
00:19:22.161,00:19:23.370,Uh...
00:19:23.412,00:19:25.247,You start shaving your face?
00:19:29.460,00:19:31.378,"First Platoon, mount up!"
00:19:31.420,00:19:32.964,Move out!
00:19:38.845,00:19:40.847,"War's not going anywhere, sir."
00:19:45.101,00:19:47.645,You heard him.
00:20:07.123,00:20:08.374,Hey!
00:20:08.415,00:20:10.043,"Go fuck yourself, Wardaddy!"
00:20:10.084,00:20:11.210,Coffee's too hot.
00:20:11.251,00:20:12.837,Still owe me 40 bucks!
00:20:13.504,00:20:15.131,What'd he say?
00:20:15.173,00:20:16.883,SOLDIER: Mount up!
00:20:16.924,00:20:18.051,Move front!
00:20:18.092,00:20:19.510,Motherfucker.
00:20:21.888,00:20:23.472,"WARDADDY: Okay, guns ready."
00:20:23.514,00:20:24.974,"SOLDIER: Good luck, gentlemen!"
00:20:44.660,00:20:47.038,"All right, there might be a wolf hiding in the sheep."
00:20:47.080,00:20:49.373,"Kid, you're up."
00:20:49.415,00:20:51.751,"Anything that makes a move, you cut them right in half."
00:20:51.792,00:20:53.127,"People are in the way, that's their problem."
00:20:53.169,00:20:55.588,"You do what you got to do, copy?"
00:20:55.629,00:20:57.590,You copy?
00:20:59.008,00:21:01.135,I copy.
00:21:01.177,00:21:02.762,"Gordo, talk him through that gun again."
00:21:02.803,00:21:04.304,GORDO: Roger.
00:21:04.346,00:21:06.640,"Hey, gun's ready."
00:21:06.682,00:21:09.936,Every five rounds is a tracer so you can see what you're hitting.
00:21:09.977,00:21:12.063,"And remember, short bursts."
00:21:12.105,00:21:14.398,That way you harvest more meat per bullet.
00:21:19.278,00:22:02.280,The Americans are over there Keep moving Keep your hands up She'll let you fuck her for a chocolate bar.
00:22:02.947,00:22:04.573,That's not true.
00:22:04.615,00:22:05.866,It's not true?
00:22:05.908,00:22:07.034,No.
00:22:07.076,00:22:08.786,Okay. It's not true.
00:22:08.828,00:22:10.746,It's completely fucking true.
00:22:10.788,00:22:12.456,give her some smokes.
00:22:12.498,00:22:14.125,"You ain't got to fuck around and give her a whole pack, neither."
00:22:14.167,00:22:15.960,"Norman, ignore him."
00:22:16.002,00:22:17.295,"Don't disappoint Christ, now."
00:22:17.336,00:22:19.880,Don't let them lead you astray.
00:22:19.922,00:22:23.550,"You see, we can kill them, but we can't fuck them, 'cause it says so in the Bible."
00:22:23.592,00:22:24.885,"BOYD: Stop, all right?"
00:22:24.927,00:22:26.304,I'm done trying to convert you heathens.
00:22:26.344,00:22:28.555,You mind if I continue invading Germany?
00:22:28.597,00:22:30.850,"Boyd, do you think Jesus loves Hitler?"
00:22:30.891,00:22:33.060,Do I think Jesus loves Hitler?
00:22:33.102,00:22:35.062,I'd assume so.
00:22:35.104,00:22:38.107,"If Hitler accepted Jesus into his heart and got baptized, he'd be saved."
00:22:38.149,00:22:39.733,It ain't gonna save him from man's justice.
00:22:39.775,00:22:41.485,What about your regular-issue Nazi line trooper?
00:22:41.527,00:22:43.529,"No, I'm not gonna do this with you."
00:22:43.570,00:22:45.405,We've been talking about the same dumb shit for three years.
00:22:45.447,00:22:47.365,You know how I stand on it.
00:22:47.407,00:22:49.952,"Hey, what about me, huh?"
00:22:49.994,00:22:51.245,Sing me a hymn?
00:22:51.287,00:22:53.622,"Yeah, sure."
00:22:53.664,00:22:54.748,I like the way your mouth moves when you sing.
00:22:54.790,00:22:55.833,Don't.
00:22:55.875,00:22:57.043,I'll sing it if you don't do that.
00:22:57.084,00:22:58.544,Let me just touch your mustache.
00:22:58.585,00:23:00.171,Don't touch me. Stop!
00:23:00.213,00:23:01.755,Why does that bother you so much when I touch your mustache?
00:23:01.797,00:23:03.590,"I'll shoot you, I swear!"
00:23:03.632,00:23:05.009,Knock off the horseplay.
00:23:08.512,00:23:11.765,"Boyd, do you think Hitler'd fuck one of us for a chocolate bar?"
00:23:13.309,00:23:14.810,I hope so.
00:24:03.692,00:24:05.069,BOYD: Ambush! Right!
00:24:05.111,00:24:07.154,"Right side, ambush!"
00:24:07.196,00:24:09.240,Fuck! Grady!
00:24:09.282,00:24:11.533,COON-ASS: You watch that tree line! We're ripe for an ambush!
00:24:12.826,00:24:14.078,"BOYD: Grady, cover right!"
00:24:19.083,00:24:20.209,PARKER: Father!
00:24:28.134,00:24:29.551,"WARDADDY: What'd you see, Boyd?"
00:24:29.593,00:24:31.511,COON-ASS: Just go out and blast them little fuckers!
00:24:31.553,00:24:32.930,What'd you see?
00:24:32.972,00:24:34.265,BOYD: I didn't see nothing.
00:24:57.788,00:25:00.040,Norman!
00:25:00.082,00:25:02.293,You cocksucker.
00:25:02.335,00:25:04.378,He was just a kid.
00:25:04.420,00:25:05.754,"I'm really sorry, Sergeant."
00:25:06.922,00:25:08.799,You see what a kid can do?
00:25:09.591,00:25:10.801,Look!
00:25:10.843,00:25:12.303,That's your fault.
00:25:12.345,00:25:14.054,That's your fucking fault.
00:25:14.096,00:25:17.016,"Next German you see with a weapon, you rake the dog shit out of him."
00:25:17.057,00:25:19.893,I don't care if it's a baby with a butter knife in one hand and mama's titty in the other.
00:25:19.935,00:25:21.103,You chop him up!
00:25:25.774,00:25:26.817,Bible?
00:25:37.661,00:25:39.455,"All tanks, Wardaddy."
00:25:41.623,00:25:43.292,Looks like I'm it.
00:25:45.961,00:25:48.130,I'll lead the column.
00:26:01.394,00:26:03.645,MAN: We have this thing set up and on the way.
00:26:03.687,00:26:07.274,"I sent over a couple men to keep contact, and the officers have been briefed."
00:26:10.403,00:26:11.820,"WARDADDY: Stop right here, Gordo."
00:26:14.407,00:26:16.825,Baker Company?
00:26:16.867,00:26:18.077,I'm not a sir.
00:26:18.118,00:26:19.745,"Me, neither."
00:26:19.786,00:26:21.038,Where's your boss?
00:26:23.332,00:26:24.791,Who's in charge of this column?
00:26:24.833,00:26:26.001,I am.
00:26:26.043,00:26:27.169,Good. I'm talking to the right man.
00:26:27.211,00:26:29.505,Park it over there.
00:26:48.065,00:26:51.735,"MAN: Yes, thank you, sir, don't tell me how long my casualties can last."
00:26:51.777,00:26:55.573,"Unless you want to come down here, stand knee-deep in their guts and form an opinion."
00:26:55.613,00:26:56.907,Baker 6 out.
00:26:56.949,00:26:58.909,Pencil-pushing motherfucker.
00:26:58.951,00:27:00.536,Load the casualties into a truck.
00:27:00.578,00:27:02.620,We're gonna drive them back to base ourselves.
00:27:02.662,00:27:03.747,Take care of our own.
00:27:05.665,00:27:07.585,"Hey, wake up!"
00:27:07.625,00:27:09.295,"All right, how many tanks we got?"
00:27:09.336,00:27:10.421,Four.
00:27:11.338,00:27:12.630,Four? You're shitting me.
00:27:14.883,00:27:15.926,I asked for 10.
00:27:17.052,00:27:18.929,Miles! Sergeant Miles!
00:27:18.971,00:27:20.097,"Yes, sir?"
00:27:20.139,00:27:21.390,Get First Platoon ready.
00:27:21.432,00:27:23.142,You're working for him now.
00:27:23.183,00:27:24.726,"If they can stand, they're in play."
00:27:24.768,00:27:25.936,Roger.
00:27:25.978,00:27:27.104,"All right, here's the deal."
00:27:27.146,00:27:29.689,I got a platoon trapped in this beet field by machine guns.
00:27:29.731,00:27:30.732,I sent my tracks in.
00:27:31.817,00:27:33.444,Jerry took them out.
00:27:33.486,00:27:36.822,"So, anti-tank guns there, there, possibly there, I don't know."
00:27:36.863,00:27:38.574,I need you to rescue my guys.
00:27:38.616,00:27:40.033,Take the guns out.
00:27:40.075,00:27:41.868,I can do that.
00:27:41.910,00:27:44.788,"All right, that clears this road into town, you push forward."
00:27:44.830,00:27:46.957,I'll join you there.
00:27:46.999,00:27:48.750,Maybe they'll surrender.
00:27:50.710,00:27:52.212,"This high ground, you got any eyes on it?"
00:27:52.254,00:27:55.007,"I had eyes there, gone."
00:27:55.048,00:27:58.469,We're flying blind.
00:27:58.511,00:27:59.553,Krauts got sights on this road.
00:27:59.595,00:28:00.678,I don't want to show my flank.
00:28:00.720,00:28:02.181,Any objection if I come in here?
00:28:02.222,00:28:05.058,"You can arrive on a fucking magic carpet, for all I care."
00:28:05.100,00:28:08.145,I know who you are.
00:28:09.146,00:28:11.398,You just paste them hard for me.
00:28:11.440,00:28:14.443,They murdered some good boys out there today.
00:28:17.779,00:28:19.781,Why don't they just quit?
00:28:22.951,00:28:24.744,Would you?
00:28:24.786,00:28:27.414,We got a platoon pinned down in this field by MGs.
00:28:27.456,00:28:30.000,Krauts got anti-tank covering the field.
00:28:30.042,00:28:34.421,"And once we cross this hedgerow, we will be in range and in their line of sight, so be alert."
00:28:34.463,00:28:36.131,Hit anything that fucking moves.
00:28:36.173,00:28:37.675,"Yeah, unless they pound us first."
00:28:37.715,00:28:40.427,"WARDADDY: If they do, we'll know exactly where they are."
00:28:40.469,00:28:43.805,Let's get these boys out of there and smash those guns.
00:28:43.847,00:28:46.766,"Then we'll capture the town, stop for the night. Clear?"
00:28:46.808,00:28:49.520,Why are we rescuing kittens instead of just driving down into Berlin?
00:28:49.562,00:28:52.398,Why are you such an asshole?
00:28:52.439,00:28:56.485,March order.
00:28:57.110,00:28:58.737,Let's go.
00:28:58.778,00:29:00.155,"MILES: All right, fuck sticks."
00:29:00.197,00:29:01.281,Mount up! By squad!
00:29:01.323,00:29:02.324,"SOLDIER: All right, mount up!"

00:29:20.467,00:29:21.843,"All tanks, Wardaddy."
00:29:21.885,00:29:23.929,"When we hit open ground, line up on me."
00:29:23.970,00:29:25.556,"Keep your spacing, don't bunch up."
00:29:25.598,00:29:28.850,"On my signal, we'll drop the doughs and roll up that 75."
00:29:28.892,00:29:29.976,Everyone copy?
00:29:30.018,00:29:31.270,BINKOWSKI: Love 1-5 copies. Wilco.

00:29:37.859,00:29:39.194,All tanks halt.
00:29:47.244,00:29:48.495,"All right, let's get the boys off."
00:29:48.537,00:29:50.038,Get them off.
00:29:50.080,00:29:51.331,"MILES: All right, ladies, you heard the man."
00:29:51.373,00:29:52.499,Everybody off!
00:29:52.541,00:29:53.959,Move out! Move!
00:29:54.000,00:29:55.835,Close your hatch.
00:30:02.509,00:30:04.637,"All tanks, move out."
00:30:04.678,00:30:06.888,Move them out.
00:30:06.930,00:30:08.223,PETERSON: Fury's going. Let's go.
00:30:08.265,00:30:09.808,"BINKOWSKI: Move, move, move, move, move."

00:30:17.775,00:30:18.858,SOLDIER 2: Catch up with the Fury.
00:30:18.900,00:30:19.901,BINKOWSKI: Stick right.
00:30:19.943,00:30:21.027,"Now, catch up."

01:21:57.413,01:21:58.455,WARDADDY: Roy's gone.
01:21:58.497,01:22:00.290,We're all that's left.
01:22:00.332,01:22:01.876,It's up to us now.
01:22:01.917,01:22:04.086,Driver halt!
01:22:04.127,01:22:06.296,"WARDADDY: Gordo, get around him."
01:22:06.338,01:22:09.132,"If we get behind him, we can kill him."
01:22:10.342,01:22:12.219,Reverse reverse!
01:22:12.261,01:22:14.430,Don't let him behind us!
01:22:14.471,01:22:16.348,"WARDADDY: Faster, Gordo!"

01:22:31.697,01:22:32.989,We got hit!
01:22:33.031,01:22:34.074,"COON-ASS: Boyd, are you all right?"
01:22:34.116,01:22:35.409,NORMAN: Aw! Shit!
01:22:35.451,01:22:36.660,BOYD: We lost power traverse.
01:22:36.702,01:22:37.994,"COON-ASS: Boyd, you stay in the fight!"
01:22:38.036,01:22:39.580,"Bible, hit him!"
01:22:41.039,01:22:42.499,Coming around!
01:22:42.541,01:22:43.959,"Gordo, you got to outrun that gun!"
01:22:44.000,01:22:45.252,"Oh, I got it! I got it!"
01:22:45.294,01:22:47.170,GERMAN SOLDIER: Fire!
01:22:47.212,01:22:49.590,"WARDADDY: Gordo, put it in third. Right stick!"
01:22:51.592,01:22:53.844,"Bible, put it up his ass, where the armor's thin."
01:22:53.886,01:22:55.053,I know where to fucking hit him!
01:22:55.095,01:22:56.221,"COON-ASS: Boyd, you're clear!"
01:22:56.263,01:22:57.347,BOYD: On the way!

01:23:02.978,01:23:04.396,"COON-ASS: Come on, Boyd, stay on him!"
01:23:04.438,01:23:06.607,"Gordo, when I say back up, you back up."
01:23:06.649,01:23:08.191,"All right, all right."

01:24:34.403,01:24:36.279,"WARDADDY: Radio check, Love 1-6."
01:24:37.197,01:24:38.824,"Yeah, boy."
01:24:39.992,01:24:41.618,"WARDADDY: Radio check, Love 1-6."
01:24:41.660,01:24:43.203,NORMAN: Fucking handed him.
01:24:45.455,01:24:46.874,"Good fucking job, Gordo."
01:24:46.916,01:24:47.917,"WARDADDY: Radio check, Love 1-6."
01:24:49.835,01:24:51.921,"Radio check, Love 1-6."
01:24:56.174,01:24:59.011,Radio's eighty-sixed.
01:25:09.521,01:25:11.189,Good shot.
01:25:11.231,01:25:14.777,"Oh, it wasn't me."
01:25:16.820,01:25:18.864,God didn't call us today.
01:25:18.906,01:25:20.657,"You hear me, boys?"
01:25:20.699,01:25:22.534,What's he doing up there?
01:25:23.493,01:25:25.328,Big pair of dice?
01:25:26.997,01:25:30.000,Everyone else came up snake eyes but us?
01:25:30.042,01:25:32.002,Lord's protection.
01:25:32.044,01:25:34.004,"Yes, sir. Yes, sir."
01:25:35.380,01:25:38.174,"Norman mowed them fuckers down, didn't he, too?"
01:25:38.216,01:25:39.509,"Good job, Norman."
01:25:39.551,01:25:40.844,"Welcome to the Army, Norm."
01:25:40.886,01:25:42.888,You did good.
01:25:42.930,01:25:44.598,Oh-ho-ho!
01:25:45.933,01:25:49.478,COON-ASS: Best job Best job I ever had.
01:25:49.519,01:25:51.229,Best job I ever had.
01:25:54.566,01:25:56.735,Best job I ever had.
01:25:57.569,01:25:58.737,GORDO: Shit.
01:26:01.239,01:26:02.866,We're still open for business.
01:26:02.908,01:26:08.080,"Let's head out for those crossroads, keep it out of Krauts' hands like we've been told."
01:26:08.122,01:26:11.583,There's a wave coming in. We're the rock to break that wave.
01:26:13.669,01:26:14.670,Vamonos.
01:26:16.797,01:26:18.090,"Gordo, get us out of here."
01:26:19.424,01:26:20.759,Fuck it.
01:26:40.403,01:26:42.405,"WARDADDY: All right, there's the crossroads."
01:26:42.447,01:26:43.740,"Gordo, take us up on that hill."
01:26:43.782,01:26:45.283,We can cover the whole valley from there.
01:26:54.459,01:26:56.211,"BOYD: Grady, get down!"
01:27:02.467,01:27:04.344,Shit! Not another fucking Tiger!
01:27:04.386,01:27:05.846,A mine.
01:27:05.888,01:27:08.057,Where?
01:27:08.098,01:27:09.641,Whew!
01:27:09.683,01:27:10.809,Everybody off.
01:27:10.851,01:27:11.935,"Yeah, I'm off."
01:27:11.977,01:27:13.436,Shit.
01:27:14.813,01:27:16.272,WARDADDY: How bad is it?
01:27:16.314,01:27:19.651,It's broke as fuck.
01:27:19.693,01:27:21.570,WARDADDY: Can you fix it?
01:27:21.611,01:27:23.446,"Yeah, why not?"
01:27:31.580,01:27:33.832,"All right, Norman, you and Coon-Ass check out that building."
01:27:33.874,01:27:35.042,Get my Thompson.
01:27:35.084,01:27:36.210,What?
01:27:36.251,01:27:37.460,Go get the Thompson.
01:27:37.502,01:27:39.254,BOYD: Gordo!
01:27:39.295,01:27:40.422,You got that rope bag?
01:27:40.463,01:27:41.506,Right here.
01:28:09.701,01:28:13.371,"You can put the gun down, Norman."
01:28:22.380,01:28:23.924,Can we go now?
01:28:26.927,01:28:29.012,"Norman, I'm sorry. You know?"
01:28:31.014,01:28:32.724,I think...
01:28:33.976,01:28:36.019,I think you're a good man.
01:28:36.979,01:28:38.647,It's what I think.
01:28:41.566,01:28:45.028,"I think maybe we ain't, but I think you are."
01:28:45.070,01:28:48.282,"See, I just..."
01:28:50.909,01:28:52.286,It's okay.
01:28:56.081,01:28:57.791,"Come on, let's go."
01:29:00.627,01:29:02.879,Anything?
01:29:02.921,01:29:05.590,It's an aid station.
01:29:09.803,01:29:10.929,WARDADDY: Kid.
01:29:14.432,01:29:17.102,"Head up top of that hill, near those trees."
01:29:18.020,01:29:20.438,Can I grab my canteen?
01:29:20.480,01:29:22.774,"Yeah, you can grab your canteen."
01:29:37.455,01:29:39.374,Norman!
01:29:39.415,01:29:41.877,"Top of the hill, then work your way from the trees."
01:32:12.819,01:32:15.280,Hey! Hey!
01:32:17.866,01:32:19.493,"Good evening, Norman."
01:32:19.533,01:32:20.618,Slow down.
01:32:20.660,01:32:22.704,They're coming right now.
01:32:22.745,01:32:23.913,The Germans!
01:32:23.955,01:32:25.332,How many?
01:32:25.374,01:32:26.540,Too many.
01:32:26.582,01:32:28.377,How many?
01:32:28.418,01:32:31.671,"Oh, about two, maybe 300 of them."
01:32:31.713,01:32:33.298,"They got vehicles, too."
01:32:33.340,01:32:35.258,Tanks?
01:32:35.300,01:32:37.511,"COON-ASS: Probably a bunch of bums looking to surrender, that's all."
01:32:37.551,01:32:39.513,"NORMAN: No. No, no, no."
01:32:39.553,01:32:41.014,They sounded like they wanted a fight.
01:32:41.056,01:32:42.556,"COON-ASS: What do you mean, they were singing?"
01:32:42.598,01:32:44.393,NORMAN: I'm telling you.
01:32:47.479,01:32:49.398,"Hey, you hear that?"
01:32:49.439,01:32:51.024,It's a goddamn SS battalion.
01:32:51.066,01:32:52.150,Bullshit.
01:32:52.192,01:32:53.818,Jesus Christ.
01:32:55.362,01:32:57.280,"Grady, get my gun."
01:32:57.322,01:32:58.948,You want to get the weapons?
01:32:58.990,01:33:00.825,What do you want to do?
01:33:00.867,01:33:04.120,"Look, it's about to be dark. We just get on up out of here, huh?"
01:33:04.162,01:33:05.955,Let 'em pass on through.
01:33:05.997,01:33:09.000,"COON-ASS: Norman, go get your shit. Go get your pack."
01:33:09.792,01:33:11.378,Let's go.
01:33:12.628,01:33:14.588,"We never run before, I ain't running now."
01:33:14.630,01:33:16.674,What was that?
01:33:16.716,01:33:17.759,We can't.
01:33:17.800,01:33:19.135,I'm gonna hold this crossroad.
01:33:19.177,01:33:22.097,"What you mean, you're gonna hold..."
01:33:22.138,01:33:24.057,"The tank's fucking busted, top!"
01:33:24.099,01:33:25.641,"Yeah, you said that."
01:33:25.683,01:33:26.976,What do you want to do?
01:33:27.018,01:33:28.270,I'm gonna hold this crossroad.
01:33:27.018,01:33:29.854,You want to sit here and hold off a SS battalion...
01:33:29.896,01:33:31.523,"No, it's not what I want to do, but it's what we're doing."
01:33:31.565,01:33:33.275,There's five of us...
01:33:33.316,01:33:35.026,What you mean fucking fighting positions when we ain't got a tank?
01:33:35.068,01:33:36.194,How we gonna fight?
01:33:36.236,01:33:37.320,We got a cannon!
01:33:37.362,01:33:38.405,"GORDO: Don, that don't make sense!"
01:33:38.447,01:33:40.990,Stop! What are you doing?
01:33:55.547,01:33:57.591,Get out of here.
01:34:05.265,01:34:08.602,"Boys, take care of yourselves. Get to that tree line."
01:34:17.444,01:34:18.903,It's all right.
01:34:20.029,01:34:21.239,Hmm.
01:34:22.491,01:34:24.117,It's all right.
01:34:27.203,01:34:28.622,It's my home.
01:34:45.763,01:34:47.807,I'm staying here with you.
01:34:52.479,01:34:54.022,All right.
01:34:54.063,01:34:55.982,I'll need you to load.
01:34:58.610,01:35:01.070,"Boys, get on."
01:35:03.365,01:35:04.949,"Grady, come on."
01:35:09.538,01:35:11.080,We're gonna stay.
01:35:11.122,01:35:12.290,Uh-huh.
01:35:17.128,01:35:18.796,What is your plan?
01:35:32.310,01:35:33.562,Fuck it.
01:35:37.731,01:35:39.317,Get us one of them dead Krauts.
01:36:09.097,01:36:10.640,Light him up.
01:36:32.537,01:36:34.372,COON-ASS: You wanna take that kit right there.
01:36:34.414,01:36:38.084,Go and grab it. That's it.
01:36:38.710,01:36:39.835,Grease gun.
01:36:39.877,01:36:41.755,"Go on, hand it to him."
01:36:41.795,01:36:44.882,"COON-ASS: Go ahead and get it ready. Listen, you do not waste one shot."
01:36:44.924,01:36:46.259,You hear me?
01:36:46.301,01:36:47.677,BOYD: Grenades.
01:36:47.719,01:36:49.845,BOYD: Put that there.
01:36:49.887,01:36:52.390,What kind of rounds you got up there? Norm?
01:36:52.432,01:36:53.725,I only got two.
01:36:53.767,01:36:55.644,Ready?
01:36:55.685,01:36:56.894,COON-ASS: That's it. Yeah.
01:36:58.772,01:37:01.149,NORMAN: I'm going through ammo like water.
01:37:01.190,01:37:05.654,"That's four rounds of smoke, and 23 super charge and 33 solid shot."
01:37:05.695,01:37:07.447,"What you want, top?"
01:37:07.489,01:37:09.365,Set the point delay.
01:37:09.407,01:37:10.659,"BOYD: Norman, get it ready."
01:37:15.871,01:37:17.749,COON-ASS: That's it.
01:37:21.628,01:37:23.171,"COON-ASS: Gordo, grab me that one."
01:37:29.135,01:37:30.970,Boyd.
01:37:31.012,01:37:32.764,NORMAN: Give me that can.
01:37:49.113,01:37:50.406,Might as well get a little tight.
01:37:50.448,01:37:53.242,Won't be around for the hangover.
01:38:11.927,01:38:13.262,Ah...
01:38:13.304,01:38:15.515,"God, that's better than good."
01:38:16.224,01:38:17.225,Mmm.
01:38:21.312,01:38:22.814,Give it here.
01:38:28.361,01:38:29.779,Give it here.
01:38:35.076,01:38:36.244,What you gonna do with that?
01:38:36.285,01:38:37.871,I'm gonna drink it.
01:38:39.414,01:38:42.458,I know you hate me preaching. I know it.
01:38:42.500,01:38:45.336,"But what we're doing here is a righteous act, gentlemen."
01:38:45.378,01:38:47.004,"You hear me, Gordo?"
01:38:52.301,01:38:55.346,"You know, there's a Bible verse I think about sometimes."
