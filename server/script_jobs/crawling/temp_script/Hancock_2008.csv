00:00:05.756,00:00:07.341,"I said, are you gonna get it crazy?"
00:00:07.341,00:00:09.050,I'll get down to it.
00:00:09.050,00:00:14.515,"...get it all down, get it all night, get it all right, get it out of sight, and get it down, baby?"
00:00:14.515,00:00:16.016,"Whammer Jammer, let me hear ya."

00:00:44.879,00:00:47.756,White SUV heading east on Alameda service road.
00:00:47.756,00:00:49.008,Suspects: three Asian males.
00:00:49.008,00:00:50.425,Request backup immediately.

00:01:52.654,00:01:54.239,Hancock.
00:01:54.239,00:01:57.034,"Nailed the suspects, uh, for attempted robbery..."
00:02:03.707,00:02:06.085,"What, boy?"
00:02:06.085,00:02:08.045,Bad guys.
00:02:08.045,00:02:10.756,CHERYL: --trying to cut them off.
00:02:10.756,00:02:16.595,"They have their hands outside the white SUV, shooting randomly on the freeway."
00:02:16.595,00:02:20.348,"What, did you want a cookie?"
00:02:20.348,00:02:22.935,Asshole.
00:02:22.935,00:02:25.104,You heard me.
00:02:25.104,00:02:27.940,They're cutting cars off left and right at high speed...
00:02:31.401,00:02:32.987,Please stay off the freeway.
00:02:32.987,00:02:36.657,I understand that there are three suspects in the white SUV...
00:02:36.657,00:02:38.993,Asshole.
00:03:10.816,00:03:12.026,Look out!
00:03:50.105,00:03:51.398,Hancock?!
00:03:51.398,00:03:52.774,"HANCOCK: Hey, hey, hey. Hey."
00:03:52.774,00:03:55.069,"Beat it, Soulja Boy!"
00:03:55.069,00:03:59.280,"REPORTER: Hancock is in the car, and he appears to be negotiating with the gunmen."
00:03:59.280,00:04:00.991,He smells like a bar.
00:04:00.991,00:04:02.409,Shh. Shh. Shh.
00:04:02.409,00:04:04.203,You pay for new roof!
00:04:04.203,00:04:05.996,"Look, hey, hey, hey, fellas, fellas."
00:04:05.996,00:04:09.249,Hey. I don't give a shit what you did. I don't care.
00:04:09.249,00:04:13.212,"Three guys in the car, no girls, rave music."
00:04:13.212,00:04:14.796,"Hey, I'm not gonna judge."
00:04:14.796,00:04:24.139,"But if you don't pull over and give yourselves up, quietly, I swear to Christ, your head is going up the driver's ass."
00:04:24.139,00:04:26.600,His head is going up your ass.
00:04:26.600,00:04:30.353,"And you drew the short stick, 'cause your head is going up my ass."
00:04:30.353,00:04:32.189,Shoot this asshole!
00:04:39.654,00:04:41.073,What the f--k!?
00:04:54.377,00:04:56.171,REPORTER: The department is on their way.
00:04:56.171,00:04:58.423,There's just chaos here on the 105.
00:05:10.393,00:05:12.020,Konnichiwa.
00:05:12.020,00:05:14.022,"FUGITIVE 1: What? I'm not Japanese, man!"
00:05:14.022,00:05:15.190,Put us down!
00:05:15.190,00:05:17.609,"Oh, now you speaky Engly, huh?"
00:05:17.609,00:05:19.153,Speaky Engly now?
00:05:30.664,00:05:32.457,You broke my glasses.
00:05:32.457,00:05:35.376,I'm sorry. Take my Ray-Bans!
00:05:35.376,00:05:38.130,Put us down!
00:05:38.130,00:05:40.715,"FUGITIVE 1: Yes, please! Please!"
00:05:40.715,00:05:43.551,I'm real good at down.
00:05:43.551,00:05:44.886,All right? All right.
00:05:50.433,00:05:56.564,"This, Hancock's latest act of so-called heroics took a hefty financial toll."
00:05:56.564,00:06:11.872,"Initial damage estimates are said to top $9 million, which, if accurate, represents a personal record for the notoriously publicity-shy Hancock, who, as usual, can't be reached for comment."
00:06:11.872,00:06:16.375,"LT. DORMAN: With all the cracks to the concrete, with all the bullets, the water damage, fires..."
00:06:17.627,00:06:22.049,...L.A. would be a lot better off if this guy would just leave and let us get on with our jobs.
00:06:22.049,00:06:26.469,"He has never asked me for a badge, and he has never worked with us in any capacity whatsoever. Zero."
00:06:26.469,00:06:28.429,I don't mind if he'd just do it somewhere else.
00:06:28.429,00:06:29.806,"New York, maybe."
00:06:29.806,00:06:31.350,Let them suffer with him for a while.
00:06:31.350,00:06:32.976,What the hell's the crane doing there?
00:06:32.976,00:06:35.354,"Move the-- The crane's not gonna help, idiot."
00:06:35.354,00:06:37.564,MAN: How are we supposed to get them down?
00:06:37.564,00:06:41.484,"I will break my foot off in your ass, woman."
00:06:41.484,00:06:44.946,This Hancock guy is surely on some kind of mission.
00:06:44.946,00:06:49.993,"And he's using our city to beat himself up, for reasons known only to him."
00:06:49.993,00:06:55.414,REPORTER 2: We'll have live shots later from Chopper 1 for the removal of the SUV from the landmark needle.
00:06:59.294,00:07:01.213,MAN: Sir? Ray Embrey.
00:07:01.213,00:07:03.548,Ray.
00:07:03.548,00:07:06.301,So...
00:07:06.301,00:07:10.680,"Well, a-actually, I think Bono is the Bono of PR, but, uh, I do try."
00:07:10.680,00:07:12.432,Well...let's see it.
00:07:12.432,00:07:15.977,Okay. I'll get right into it.
00:07:15.977,00:07:19.731,"I'm, um, here to talk to you about charitable giving."
00:07:19.731,00:07:22.192,Okay? And we all know the way that that works.
00:07:22.192,00:07:28.156,"You give 1, maybe 2 percent of your net cash, and you get an armband, or a wristband, or a ribbon or whatever it is."
00:07:28.156,00:07:29.532,It's nowhere near enough.
00:07:29.532,00:07:34.495,And that's why we at Embrey Publicity would like to offer you...
00:07:34.495,00:07:36.581,the AllHeart symbol.
00:07:36.581,00:07:46.049,"Now, you would be among a very select group of corporate giants to bear this logo on your product."
00:07:46.049,00:07:54.766,"And what this would say to the public is that your company, Pharmatopsis, has made a radical contribution to helping our world."
00:07:54.766,00:07:56.851,And here's all you need to do to qualify.
00:07:56.851,00:08:01.022,"Your new TB drug, Mycodin?"
00:08:01.022,00:08:04.067,We would like for you to give that product away for free.
00:08:07.404,00:08:09.530,Did you say free?
00:08:12.075,00:08:13.534,Only to those who really need it.
00:08:13.534,00:08:17.038,Only to those who without it would otherwise die.
00:08:17.038,00:08:21.209,"All right, as a concept, free is kind of up there with, uh, you know, lethal side effects."
00:08:21.209,00:08:22.794,Mandatory product recall.
00:08:22.794,00:08:24.421,"MAN: Get indicted, go to jail."
00:08:24.421,00:08:26.840,"Get out, work at IHOP for the rest of your career."
00:08:26.840,00:08:29.468,Understandable reaction.
00:08:29.468,00:08:34.055,But it is the brand that represents a fairer and better world.
00:08:34.055,00:08:35.390,The brand...
00:08:35.390,00:08:39.227,that everyone is talking about.
00:08:39.227,00:08:41.271,Who is everyone?
00:08:41.271,00:08:44.149,We do already have a sports franchise.
00:08:44.149,00:08:46.609,"MAN 2: NFL? Uh, NBA? MLB?"
00:08:46.609,00:08:50.030,Soccer.
00:08:50.030,00:08:51.698,"RAY: Well, it's a local team."
00:08:51.698,00:08:53.116,Encino Hurricanes.
00:08:54.409,00:08:55.702,It's my son's team.
00:08:55.702,00:08:59.831,"Anyway, we can save the world."
00:08:59.831,00:09:03.918,All right? Someone's just gotta go first.
00:09:03.918,00:09:06.004,What do you say?
00:09:07.922,00:09:10.300,Are you a crackpot?
00:09:18.225,00:09:19.934,"RAY: Hey, hon."
00:09:19.934,00:09:22.062,You're probably at the store.
00:09:22.062,00:09:24.647,I think I made a connection.
00:09:26.483,00:09:28.068,Not really.
00:09:28.068,00:09:30.653,"Listen, tell Aaron that I'm coming, and I-- Damn it."
00:09:30.653,00:09:32.947,"And I want some meatballs, okay?"
00:09:32.947,00:09:35.450,I need some Spaghetti Madness.
00:09:35.450,00:09:37.160,I'll see you in about 20 minutes.
00:09:37.160,00:09:39.037,"Hey. What is it, National Horn Day?"
00:09:41.081,00:09:42.916,Idiot.
00:09:46.127,00:09:48.755,Hey.
00:09:48.755,00:09:50.590,Hey. Hey!
00:09:50.590,00:09:52.967,Move it.
00:09:52.967,00:09:55.345,Do you not hear that horn?
00:09:55.345,00:09:57.347,Let's go. I got a train!
00:09:57.347,00:09:59.057,Move it!
00:10:00.225,00:10:01.935,Back your car up.
00:10:01.935,00:10:03.603,I can't go anywhere.
00:10:03.603,00:10:05.188,RAY: Son of a bitch!
00:10:06.565,00:10:08.108,"Uh. Fix the handle, Ray."
00:10:08.108,00:10:11.069,Fix the handle.
00:10:14.030,00:10:15.907,Get out!
00:10:21.704,00:10:23.457,Get off the track!
00:10:26.334,00:10:28.503,MAN: Whoa!
00:10:28.503,00:10:31.005,"RAY: Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
00:10:32.591,00:10:35.093,MAN 1: Let's get him out.
00:10:35.093,00:10:37.345,Somebody help him.
00:10:37.345,00:10:39.514,"WOMAN: Please, that guy's still in there."
00:10:41.682,00:10:43.059,You sure?
00:10:43.059,00:10:44.603,WOMAN: Get him out of there!
00:11:02.621,00:11:04.372,WOMAN 2: You guys doing all right?
00:11:15.091,00:11:16.675,"Ah, shit."
00:11:16.675,00:11:19.387,I'm all right. I'm okay.
00:11:19.387,00:11:21.181,HANCOCK: All of you people...
00:11:21.181,00:11:26.227,"blocking the intersection, you're all idiots."
00:11:26.227,00:11:28.396,You're the one that threw the dude's car at her.
00:11:28.396,00:11:29.648,And what's with the train?
00:11:29.648,00:11:32.484,Why didn't you just go straight up in the air with the car?
00:11:32.484,00:11:34.027,"WOMAN: Yeah, why didn't you go straight up?"
00:11:34.027,00:11:36.571,You've obviously injured that poor woman.
00:11:36.571,00:11:38.323,She's right.
00:11:40.367,00:11:43.953,"Okay. Well, you should sue McDonald's 'cause they fucked you up."
00:11:43.953,00:11:45.997,You're an asshole.
00:11:45.997,00:11:48.458,And I can smell that liquor on your breath.
00:11:48.458,00:11:50.126,"'Cause I've been drinking, bitch."
00:11:50.126,00:11:52.003,You're a drunk asshole.
00:11:52.003,00:11:53.338,You think you're such a hero.
00:11:53.338,00:11:56.924,Asshole.
00:11:56.924,00:11:58.510,WOMAN 3: You're nothing but an asshole.
00:11:58.510,00:12:00.261,MAN 3: We don't need you in this city.
00:12:01.929,00:12:04.974,MAN 4: Some superhero you are.
00:12:04.974,00:12:07.185,Shut up!
00:12:07.185,00:12:09.229,Don't you people understand? I'm alive.
00:12:09.229,00:12:10.938,I get to go home and see my family.
00:12:10.938,00:12:13.233,"I should be dead right now, right here."
00:12:13.233,00:12:14.901,"Yeah, he could've gone straight up."
00:12:14.901,00:12:16.486,"Obviously, you should've."
00:12:16.486,00:12:21.241,"You know, and I was upside down for the train, but, uh..."
00:12:21.241,00:12:24.244,No. Thank you.
00:12:24.244,00:12:26.913,"Thank you very much, Hancock. Thank you."
00:12:26.913,00:12:29.165,"Thank you, Hancock."
00:12:33.211,00:12:36.047,"You're not flying by the Valley, are you?"
00:12:40.093,00:12:41.760,BOY: Throw the ball.
00:12:41.760,00:12:43.304,MAN: Oh...
00:12:43.304,00:12:45.139,"Monte. One guy'll line up here, all right?"
00:12:45.139,00:12:46.600,Hike the ball.
00:12:46.600,00:12:48.685,This guy'll be right here.
00:12:48.685,00:12:51.479,This guy'll drop back. Hut.
00:12:53.481,00:12:55.191,Great. Thank you.
00:12:57.193,00:13:00.988,"Nice aim. The driveway would've been better, but-- What's going on, Dad?"
00:13:00.988,00:13:02.781,Daddy's had a little bit of a day.
00:13:02.781,00:13:05.285,"Look at you, huh?"
00:13:05.285,00:13:08.996,"This guy here, dragging Daddy's car into the driveway."
00:13:08.996,00:13:11.499,Who is this?
00:13:11.499,00:13:14.419,That's right. Hancock.
00:13:14.419,00:13:16.671,"God, Ray. What happened to the car?"
00:13:16.671,00:13:18.590,"RAY: Oh, boy. You would not have believed it."
00:13:18.590,00:13:21.259,I came this close to getting hit by a train.
00:13:21.259,00:13:23.052,If it wasn't for that guy...
00:13:23.052,00:13:26.222,"He saved my life. I mean-- Hancock, this is my wife, Mary."
00:13:26.222,00:13:27.974,"Believe that, pal? I almost kissed a train today."
00:13:27.974,00:13:30.393,Saw my whole life flash before my eyes.
00:13:30.393,00:13:33.146,He saved your life?
00:13:33.146,00:13:34.981,"Hey, you good?"
00:13:34.981,00:13:36.983,All right.
00:13:36.983,00:13:39.611,Keep it off the tracks.
00:13:43.406,00:13:45.366,"RAY: Um, h-h-hang on a-- One second."
00:13:45.366,00:13:47.327,"Hancock, um, you eat, yes?"
00:13:47.327,00:13:48.869,Human food?
00:13:48.869,00:13:50.413,You like meatballs?
00:13:50.413,00:13:54.000,"No. Aaron, sweetheart, he has to go and do other-- I love meatballs."
00:13:54.000,00:13:55.918,"Who's so busy they can't have a meal, huh?"
00:13:55.918,00:13:57.420,And it's on us. Please.
00:13:57.420,00:13:59.172,I'm not even gonna take no for an answer.
00:13:59.172,00:14:00.381,Get inside the house.
00:14:25.573,00:14:28.827,Why do you have an eagle on your hat?
00:14:28.827,00:14:30.244,Uh...
00:14:30.244,00:14:31.830,Do you like eagles?
00:14:31.830,00:14:34.081,"Uh, this guy's like a little talking machine, huh?"
00:14:34.081,00:14:36.209,RAY: We don't have a lot of guests over here.
00:14:36.209,00:14:38.837,"Look at that, huh?"
00:14:38.837,00:14:41.840,RAY: No? All right.
00:14:41.840,00:14:43.257,Yeah.
00:14:43.257,00:14:45.968,We started Spaghetti Madness about two years ago.
00:14:45.968,00:14:47.595,We do it every Thursday.
00:14:47.595,00:14:49.806,And we have not missed a Thursday in...
00:14:49.806,00:14:51.391,Ever.
00:14:51.391,00:14:52.726,Ever? That's a long time.
00:14:52.726,00:14:54.935,"Yes, sir."
00:14:54.935,00:14:56.896,"That's some good meatballs, boy."
00:14:56.896,00:14:58.481,Aaron.
00:14:58.481,00:15:00.483,Your mama's calling you.
00:15:00.483,00:15:03.027,No. His name is Aaron.
00:15:03.027,00:15:05.697,"Hey, Aaron, pal, how was school today? Huh?"
00:15:05.697,00:15:07.031,AARON: Fine.
00:15:07.031,00:15:09.116,"No more problems with that bully, Michael?"
00:15:09.116,00:15:10.535,Michel.
00:15:10.535,00:15:12.078,But not like a girl's name.
00:15:12.078,00:15:13.705,"No, no, I know."
00:15:13.705,00:15:18.918,"RAY: Yeah. Michel, Hancock, is this-- Hancock? Michel is this neighborhood bully."
00:15:18.918,00:15:24.090,We've been trying to teach Aaron a little bit about conflict resolution.
00:15:24.090,00:15:25.842,"Yeah. Turn the other cheek, all that?"
00:15:25.842,00:15:26.967,That's exactly right.
00:15:26.967,00:15:28.553,Yeah.
00:15:28.553,00:15:31.598,"Well, just, uh, never turn that one, all right?"
00:15:31.598,00:15:33.057,Never let 'em punk you.
00:15:33.057,00:15:34.809,"AARON: Got it, Mr. Hancock."
00:15:34.809,00:15:40.899,"The way you deal with bullies, you take your right foot, bring it right up, catch him in his little piss pump."
00:15:40.899,00:15:44.110,"You don't have to do that, honey, okay? Seriously."
00:15:44.110,00:15:45.403,It's a good idea.
00:15:45.403,00:15:51.910,"You aim straight, and make sure he can't use that thing for nothing but a flap to keep the dust out of his butt crack."
00:15:51.910,00:15:53.369,"Okay, please. Just stop."
00:15:53.369,00:15:55.288,"Michel is not a man, okay?"
00:15:55.288,00:15:56.997,He's a little boy.
00:15:55.288,00:16:00.960,"And his parents happen to be going through a really, really bad divorce, and that's why he's acting up."
00:16:00.960,00:16:05.757,"And maybe you don't know this, but not everything in this world gets resolved with force."
00:16:05.757,00:16:08.760,"Not everything has to be bang, scream, blood..."
00:16:08.760,00:16:10.177,...more blood.
00:16:10.177,00:16:12.931,Just destruct-- Angel. We're okay.
00:16:12.931,00:16:17.351,She watches so much news that sometimes it gets to be a little too much.
00:16:17.351,00:16:18.603,Got a toilet?
00:16:18.603,00:16:20.980,"RAY: Yep. Yeah, just past the fridge."
00:16:24.066,00:16:25.610,Are--?
00:16:28.028,00:16:32.158,Did he just take the whiskey bottle to the bathroom?
00:16:32.158,00:16:33.701,Do you want him to kill us all?
00:16:33.701,00:16:35.954,Thanks for coming on in.
00:16:35.954,00:16:38.247,"Very, yeah."
00:16:38.247,00:16:40.708,"Bye, Hancock."
00:16:40.708,00:16:43.878,Ah!
00:16:43.878,00:16:45.713,"Uh, it was-- It was a joke."
00:16:45.713,00:16:47.757,"HANCOCK: Hey, sorry."
00:16:45.713,00:16:49.467,I was just trying to-- He got it.
00:16:49.467,00:16:51.845,I owe you more than I can say.
00:16:51.845,00:16:54.096,Just hear me out. I'd like to return the favor.
00:16:54.096,00:16:55.598,Do you know what I do for a living?
00:16:55.598,00:16:57.099,I'm in public relations.
00:16:57.099,00:16:58.977,You know what that is?
00:16:58.977,00:17:00.854,Of course you do.
00:17:00.854,00:17:04.607,"We change the way people see products, companies, people, that stuff."
00:17:04.607,00:17:11.238,"Listen, I see you on the news and I see you out there today, and it can't feel good that people, you know, hate you."
00:17:11.238,00:17:13.407,"It's, uh, good to meet you, Ray."
00:17:13.407,00:17:15.075,"But, I mean, you know, hear me out."
00:17:15.075,00:17:17.077,"People-- Don't get me wrong, they should love you."
00:17:17.077,00:17:18.872,"They really should, okay?"
00:17:18.872,00:17:20.331,And I wanna deliver that for you.
00:17:20.331,00:17:21.708,It's the least that I can do.
00:17:21.708,00:17:23.250,"You know, you're a superhero."
00:17:23.250,00:17:25.419,Kids should ask you for your autograph.
00:17:25.419,00:17:27.463,People should cheer you on the streets.
00:17:27.463,00:17:29.215,What the hell are you pricks looking at?
00:17:29.215,00:17:31.467,"No, no, no. Shh, they're not-- It's all right."
00:17:31.467,00:17:33.302,They're not pricks.
00:17:33.302,00:17:37.264,"But I want you to give me one short pitch, you know?"
00:17:37.264,00:17:40.184,That's all I ask. Okay?
00:17:40.184,00:17:42.311,You use...
00:17:42.311,00:17:43.563,Put it under here?
00:17:45.023,00:17:46.858,Put it right there.
00:17:46.858,00:17:48.234,E-mail me or whatever.
00:17:48.234,00:17:49.903,"You just fly on over, I don't know."
00:17:49.903,00:17:51.445,"You know, I want you to think about it."
00:17:51.445,00:17:52.989,Okay? Just be careful when you go.
00:17:52.989,00:17:54.281,"You sleep on it, all right?"
00:17:54.281,00:17:55.700,You get back to me?
00:17:56.868,00:17:58.536,I'll be right here.
00:17:58.536,00:18:00.621,"Please don't stare, you guys."
00:18:00.621,00:18:02.415,He's kind of one of us.
00:18:08.880,00:18:10.256,What about AllHeart?
00:18:10.256,00:18:12.132,"RAY: It's a nonstarter, babe, you know?"
00:18:12.132,00:18:13.718,I'm chasing windmills with that.
00:18:13.718,00:18:16.971,"And, um, maybe I can't change the world, but I can change this guy's life."
00:18:16.971,00:18:18.765,"I mean, just think about all the good he can do."
00:18:18.765,00:18:20.975,I think you're wasting your time with this guy.
00:18:20.975,00:18:23.061,You really hate him.
00:18:23.061,00:18:26.230,"Hate? I don't hate him, Ray."
00:18:26.230,00:18:28.357,Just...look at the news.
00:18:28.357,00:18:30.276,You can see what he does.
00:18:30.276,00:18:33.195,"I think he just needs people to care, you know?"
00:18:35.865,00:18:38.034,"MARY: You see the good in everybody, Ray."
00:18:38.034,00:18:40.286,Even sometimes when it's not there.
00:18:42.288,00:18:45.458,I have a feeling about this.
00:18:48.878,00:18:51.881,I know this kind of guy.
00:20:38.863,00:20:53.920,DRESSED CHICKEN IN TOWN My bad. Everybody all right?
00:20:53.920,00:20:56.630,BOY: I'll go and get my mommy.
00:20:56.630,00:20:58.465,He is an asshole.
00:21:06.432,00:21:08.768,"What's your name, boy?"
00:21:08.768,00:21:12.396,Oh. Do you-- You know Aaron?
00:21:12.396,00:21:15.066,Oui. Le petit asshole.
00:21:16.400,00:21:18.069,"Well, uh..."
00:21:18.069,00:21:20.320,seems to be a pretty good kid.
00:21:20.320,00:21:24.158,"Uh, just wanna ask you to lay off of him a little bit."
00:21:24.158,00:21:25.576,"Why, asshole?"
00:21:28.412,00:21:30.248,You're gonna stop calling me that.
00:21:30.248,00:21:31.540,Asshole.
00:21:31.540,00:21:33.167,That's not my name.
00:21:33.167,00:21:35.544,Ass...hole.
00:21:39.506,00:21:42.135,Call me a asshole...
00:21:42.135,00:21:43.677,one more time.
00:21:47.389,00:21:48.682,Asshole.
00:21:51.310,00:21:53.312,"How about you, thickness?"
00:21:54.480,00:21:56.649,Goggles?
00:21:56.649,00:22:00.153,RAY: Hancock. You son of a gun.
00:22:00.153,00:22:01.946,Ask Mary. I had a feeling.
00:22:01.946,00:22:04.240,"I said, he heard me and he's ready for a change."
00:22:04.240,00:22:05.992,Great. You do this?
00:22:05.992,00:22:07.534,"Yeah, yeah."
00:22:07.534,00:22:09.078,This is a great place for us to start.
00:22:09.078,00:22:10.496,"I know you don't drive, but-- Oh, damn it."
00:22:12.873,00:22:14.500,All right. You-- You're all right.
00:22:14.500,00:22:17.711,You're all right.
00:22:19.297,00:22:22.300,"Oh, stop crying, punk-ass. Go ahead."
00:22:23.717,00:22:25.427,Not okay.
00:22:25.427,00:22:26.804,Okay?
00:22:25.427,00:22:28.388,He-- Really not okay.
00:22:28.388,00:22:30.057,This is some of the stuff we're gonna work on.
00:22:30.057,00:22:33.186,How do you think that conversation's gonna go down with his mom?
00:22:33.186,00:22:36.354,Landing like that in the street's also on the uncool side.
00:22:36.354,00:22:39.942,"No, that was already like that when I got here, Ray."
00:22:39.942,00:22:42.195,RAY: I live here.
00:22:42.195,00:22:43.904,We're just gonna make those problems of the past.
00:22:43.904,00:22:45.239,All right?
00:22:43.904,00:22:46.782,I'm gonna teach you how to interface with the public.
00:22:46.782,00:22:48.159,Where's the wife?
00:22:48.159,00:22:50.286,"RAY: Uh, Mary took Aaron to his soccer game."
00:22:50.286,00:22:52.412,"Hancock, pulled some stuff up on YouTube."
00:22:52.412,00:22:57.001,Surprisingly large amount of not-great stuff on you that's gonna be helpful.
00:22:57.001,00:22:58.336,What is this?
00:22:58.336,00:23:01.297,That's me trying to change the world.
00:23:01.297,00:23:03.299,"Unfortunately, not doing real well."
00:23:03.299,00:23:05.467,Come on. Let's get to you.
00:23:05.467,00:23:08.095,This stuff was on YouTube.
00:23:08.095,00:23:10.056,"Now, everybody loves a Nutty Buddy, I get it."
00:23:10.056,00:23:11.515,"But this doesn't work, sir."
00:23:11.515,00:23:12.850,"HANCOCK: Hey, give me a Nutty Buddy."
00:23:12.850,00:23:14.518,"All right, back up."
00:23:16.270,00:23:18.356,Mom! Mom!
00:23:20.149,00:23:22.109,Those are...children.
00:23:23.736,00:23:27.156,BOY: We've been waiting for a long time-- Get that camera out of my face.
00:23:27.156,00:23:30.659,"You ever, uh, put out an apartment fire, Ray?"
00:23:30.659,00:23:32.870,"No, I haven't done that. I'm in PR."
00:23:32.870,00:23:34.496,Mm. My ass was hot.
00:23:35.915,00:23:37.541,All right.
00:23:37.541,00:23:38.918,"This is Walter, the gray whale."
00:23:38.918,00:23:41.837,"Everybody remembers him, stuck on the beach north of Zuma."
00:23:41.837,00:23:44.340,Along comes Hancock.
00:23:45.383,00:23:46.926,MAN: Hancock!
00:23:56.810,00:23:59.521,I don't even remember that.
00:23:59.521,00:24:02.775,Greenpeace does.
00:24:02.775,00:24:10.448,"This all kind of gets redundant after a while, but my basic diagnosis of your fundamental problem is-- Do you wanna hear it?"
00:24:10.448,00:24:11.867,You're an asshole.
00:24:11.867,00:24:14.370,I know. I call it like I see it though.
00:24:14.370,00:24:17.539,"It's not a crime to be an asshole, but it's counterproductive."
00:24:17.539,00:24:19.792,"Not a crime-- But you are an asshole, don't you think?"
00:24:19.792,00:24:21.627,Be careful.
00:24:21.627,00:24:23.087,"All right, how about this?"
00:24:23.087,00:24:25.005,I've been thinking about something.
00:24:25.005,00:24:27.841,This kind of goes to how you present yourself.
00:24:27.841,00:24:29.676,Come on. Really?
00:24:29.676,00:24:32.305,What springs to mind...
00:24:32.305,00:24:33.764,when you see this?
00:24:35.308,00:24:36.683,Homo.
00:24:38.978,00:24:40.729,What about that?
00:24:44.108,00:24:46.026,Norwegian homo.
00:24:46.026,00:24:47.403,Let's move past the comics.
00:24:47.403,00:24:49.322,Let's get into something a little deeper.
00:24:49.322,00:24:50.948,I think...
00:24:50.948,00:24:55.661,that deep down you behave badly because you're lonely.
00:24:55.661,00:24:58.122,"I think, deep down, you want people's acceptance."
00:24:59.373,00:25:02.042,"Come on, now."
00:24:59.373,00:25:05.045,"You save people's lives, and they reject you, and so you reject them back."
00:25:05.045,00:25:08.341,"And it's a v-- Oh, and-- And we're gonna switch that cycle."
00:25:08.341,00:25:10.050,"We're gonna start fresh, start anew."
00:25:10.050,00:25:11.427,This is outstanding.
00:25:11.427,00:25:14.138,If you turn some of this power into willpower...
00:25:14.138,00:25:16.556,Almost.
00:25:16.556,00:25:18.476,"Hey, Hancock!"
00:25:18.476,00:25:20.353,"Yeah, we did."
00:25:20.353,00:25:22.062,I'm making lunch.
00:25:22.062,00:25:24.690,"Hey, sweetheart."
00:25:24.690,00:25:26.650,Have you been watching the news?
00:25:26.650,00:25:28.277,"No, we've been working on-- Oh, sweetheart."
00:25:28.277,00:25:29.820,Interfacing with the public.
00:25:29.820,00:25:31.697,MARY: This has been on all day.
00:25:31.697,00:25:37.244,"The law is the law, Mr. Hancock, and you are not above it."
00:25:37.244,00:25:42.916,"Felony destruction of property, amounting to tens of millions of dollars, theft, and now this."
00:25:42.916,00:25:52.134,"From where I sit, I see a selfish, self-absorbed man with a lot of muscle, but no regard for anyone but yourself."
00:25:52.134,00:25:55.054,"Mr. Hancock, let me remind you."
00:25:55.054,00:25:57.555,You are not above the law.
00:25:57.555,00:26:02.520,You have failed to show at over 600 subpoenas in civil suits.
00:26:02.520,00:26:04.730,Anybody else would be held in contempt.
00:26:04.730,00:26:06.357,"But, oh, no. Not you."
00:26:06.357,00:26:13.780,"You may be a superhero, but let me tell you this: You're not nearly as strong as the U.S. Constitution."
00:26:13.780,00:26:15.449,"Bank on it, buddy."
00:26:15.449,00:26:20.079,We do not condone the t-- Genius.
00:26:20.079,00:26:21.621,Things just got real.
00:26:21.621,00:26:23.457,And this is exactly what we need. Perfect.
00:26:23.457,00:26:26.544,There's a DA trying to figure out how to put you in jail.
00:26:26.544,00:26:29.380,Bitch can try.
00:26:29.380,00:26:32.216,Hm?
00:26:32.216,00:26:35.344,People take you for granted.
00:26:35.344,00:26:38.722,"People don't like you, Hancock."
00:26:38.722,00:26:40.266,"Two weeks, you know?"
00:26:40.266,00:26:41.892,The public will be clamoring for you.
00:26:41.892,00:26:43.894,"When they do, we'll be ready."
00:26:43.894,00:26:48.315,"And, uh, worst-case scenario is I'm wrong, and you just-- You know, fly out of there."
00:26:48.315,00:26:50.234,What do you got to lose?
00:27:08.710,00:27:11.547,I apologize to the people of Los Angeles.
00:27:11.547,00:27:15.217,"My behavior has been improper, and I accept the consequences."
00:27:15.217,00:27:21.014,I ask my fellow Angelenos for their patience and understanding.
00:27:26.979,00:27:29.523,Life here can be difficult for me.
00:27:29.523,00:27:33.319,"After all, I'm the only one of my kind."
00:27:33.319,00:27:38.407,"During my incarceration, I will be participating in alcohol- and anger-management treatment."
00:27:45.122,00:27:46.582,MAN: You're a drunk bum.
00:27:46.582,00:27:48.041,You deserve better from me.
00:27:48.041,00:27:50.043,I can be better.
00:27:50.043,00:27:51.337,RAY: All right.
00:27:56.467,00:27:58.594,"OFFICER: Give me the hand, playboy."
00:28:19.532,00:28:20.907,"INMATE: I see you, punk!"
00:28:41.428,00:28:43.430,"Oh, I get it."
00:28:43.430,00:28:47.100,"I put some, uh-- Uh, most of you in here."
00:28:50.396,00:28:51.771,"INMATE: Yes, you did."
00:28:51.771,00:28:53.482,"INMATE 2: Yeah, for a year."
00:28:53.482,00:28:56.026,I can understand you feeling some kind of way about that.
00:28:56.026,00:28:57.653,What?
00:28:57.653,00:29:02.991,"Uh, so I'm gonna do me, and I'm gonna let you do you."
00:29:02.991,00:29:05.411,I-I don't want no trouble.
00:29:05.411,00:29:07.787,All right?
00:29:07.787,00:29:10.082,I just wanna go to my cell.
00:29:10.082,00:29:11.417,That ain't gonna happen.
00:29:13.377,00:29:15.588,Excuse me.
00:29:17.214,00:29:20.342,"Excuse me, please."
00:29:26.056,00:29:30.143,"If you don't move, your head is going up his ass."
00:29:37.901,00:29:40.153,Y'all fellas sure you wanna ride this train?
00:29:40.153,00:30:11.226,"Choo, choo, asshole-- Did you shove a man's head up another man's ass?"
00:30:16.982,00:30:18.442,Tsk.
00:30:18.442,00:30:21.654,We're gonna-- We're gonna circle back to that.
00:30:21.654,00:30:23.905,The DA's office wants your sentence to run eight years.
00:30:23.905,00:30:27.618,"It's a big number, but not something we didn't anticipate."
00:30:27.618,00:30:29.453,"You know, our plan is-- What are you doing?"
00:30:29.453,00:30:31.037,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
00:30:36.835,00:30:42.424,It sounded like you said they want me to spend eight years in this shithole.
00:30:42.424,00:30:45.135,This is really more like four and a half with good behavior.
00:30:45.135,00:30:56.396,"But it's-- It's irrelevant because with you out of the picture, and with the crime rate going up through the roof the DA and the cops, they're all gonna call for your immediate release."
00:30:56.396,00:30:59.525,They're gonna demand it. They-- Where are you going? Sit down.
00:30:59.525,00:31:02.194,Hey. Hey.
00:31:02.194,00:31:03.445,Stop it. Hancock.
00:31:03.445,00:31:05.113,Hancock.
00:31:05.113,00:31:06.865,You're being a coward!
00:31:06.865,00:31:09.117,"Who you talking to, Ray?"
00:31:09.117,00:31:10.327,"Who are you talking to, Ray?"
00:31:10.327,00:31:12.746,Stop pretending that you do not care.
00:31:14.414,00:31:16.291,You have a calling.
00:31:16.291,00:31:20.253,You're gonna be miserable the rest of your life until you accept that.
00:31:20.253,00:31:22.297,"Trust me. Trust this plan, this process."
00:31:22.297,00:31:25.091,Just stay in here.
00:31:25.091,00:31:28.679,"When they call, a hero's what we're gonna give 'em."
00:31:30.764,00:31:32.683,"How we gonna do that, Ray?"
00:31:34.476,00:31:36.729,"All right, guys, uh, let's start sharing."
00:31:36.729,00:31:38.063,Don?
00:31:38.063,00:31:39.356,You had something?
00:31:39.356,00:31:41.024,"Yeah, I-- I, uh..."
00:31:41.024,00:31:44.152,think I might've had a little bit of a breakthrough.
00:31:44.152,00:31:45.945,CONVICT: Good for you.
00:31:45.945,00:31:50.992,"Yeah, I mean, I-- I realized that breaking necks is-- It's easy."
00:31:50.992,00:31:53.328,"But, uh..."
00:31:50.992,00:31:56.498,I'm sitting there and I'm staring at myself in the mirror...
00:31:56.498,00:31:59.125,"and I thought, This is tough."
00:31:59.125,00:32:00.586,"CONVICT 2: Yeah, and it sounds tough."
00:32:01.837,00:32:03.129,Why do you always laugh?
00:32:03.129,00:32:05.006,Picturing you looking in the mirror.
00:32:05.006,00:32:06.759,It would scare the shit out of me too.
00:32:06.759,00:32:10.220,"Every time I'm talking, he completely ruins the cycle."
00:32:10.220,00:32:12.138,"Uh, let's watch the crosstalk, okay?"
00:32:12.138,00:32:14.600,DON: I'm not gonna share anymore if he keeps doing that.
00:32:14.600,00:32:16.101,"No, no, no."
00:32:16.101,00:32:17.436,CONVICT 3: Keep sharing.
00:32:17.436,00:32:18.687,CONVICT: Let's move on.
00:32:18.687,00:32:20.397,"Mr. Hancock, do you wanna share today?"
00:32:22.190,00:32:23.567,Pass.
00:32:23.567,00:32:25.569,RAY: Your landing is your first impression.
00:32:25.569,00:32:27.404,"It's, your-- It's your superhero handshake."
00:32:27.404,00:32:29.531,"Don't come in too hot, okay?"
00:32:29.531,00:32:31.074,Don't come in too boozy.
00:32:31.074,00:32:33.577,"And don't land on a $100,000 Mercedes. All right?"
00:32:33.577,00:32:37.205,People have to be happy that you've arrived.
00:32:37.205,00:32:38.665,"Mr. Hancock, your share."
00:32:39.583,00:32:40.876,Pass.
00:32:40.876,00:32:44.045,"RAY: So you've used the door, and the building's still intact."
00:32:44.045,00:32:46.256,People are happy that you've arrived. They feel safe now.
00:32:46.256,00:32:48.550,"And there's an officer there, and he's done a good job."
00:32:48.550,00:32:50.677,So you might want to tell him he's done a good job.
00:32:50.677,00:32:54.055,"What the hell did I have to come for, Ray, if he's done a good job?"
00:33:04.524,00:33:05.859,"CONVICT: Hey! Oh, man!"
00:33:05.859,00:33:08.361,Come on.
00:33:08.361,00:33:10.071,"RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: KBLA radio, AM 850."

00:33:13.867,00:33:15.828,"MALE CALLER: I, for one, have had enough of this guy."
00:33:15.828,00:33:19.581,"I'm glad he's doing time around bars, and I hope they don't let him off easy."
00:33:19.581,00:33:21.207,Let my cousin Pookie out.
00:33:21.207,00:33:28.131,"You know, I see you don't wear a bulletproof vest, security officer, and I respect your courage 'cause bullets don't bounce off you, they bounce off me."
00:33:32.051,00:33:34.053,"CONVICT: Oh, yeah."
00:33:34.053,00:33:36.556,FEMALE CALLER: This city is being run by gangs and drug dealers.
00:33:36.556,00:33:39.768,Hancock is the only guy who makes them shake in their boots.
00:33:39.768,00:33:42.604,"He doesn't always tie a pretty ribbon around it, but he gets the job done."
00:33:42.604,00:33:44.022,"Besides, he's hot."
00:33:44.022,00:33:45.440,Let me hear you say it.
00:33:45.440,00:33:47.484,"Let me hear you say, Good job."

00:34:14.011,00:34:16.054,"Jail watch, day five."
00:34:14.011,00:34:18.015,"And true to his word, Hancock remains incarcerated."
00:34:18.015,00:34:19.850,"Meanwhile, crime is still on the rise."
00:34:19.850,00:34:28.025,The L.A.P.D. is reporting increases of up to 30 percent in the last five days that Hancock has been behind bars.

00:34:40.495,00:34:42.039,HANCOCK: Whoa.
00:34:42.039,00:34:43.749,"Where's, uh--?"
00:34:43.749,00:34:45.208,"No, it's just us."
00:34:45.208,00:34:46.501,Ray's working.
00:34:46.501,00:34:52.007,"A-Aaron really wanted to come and see you, so we just dropped by with some Spaghetti Madness. Heh."
00:34:52.007,00:34:55.301,"I should probably let the guard check for keys-- No, no."
00:34:55.301,00:34:56.595,Here.
00:34:56.595,00:34:57.971,Here you go.

00:35:02.059,00:35:03.226,Just dig in.
00:35:03.226,00:35:04.686,"Oh, man, look at that."
00:35:04.686,00:35:06.354,Look at that.
00:35:07.981,00:35:09.315,Mm.
00:35:10.943,00:35:12.611,That's a good meatball.

00:35:29.628,00:35:33.465,"Whatever this is you're doing, don't let him down."
00:35:33.465,00:35:35.174,Okay?
00:35:37.677,00:35:40.179,"Okay. Well, we should probably go, buddy."

00:37:14.733,00:37:16.026,For when they call.
00:37:21.865,00:37:23.158,"I ain't wearing that, Ray."

00:37:40.717,00:37:42.177,A uniform represents purpose.
00:37:42.177,00:37:43.803,"Doctors, policemen, firemen. Right?"
00:37:43.803,00:37:45.222,"Ray, Ray."
00:37:45.222,00:37:47.849,It represents a calling.

00:39:57.478,00:39:59.772,You got a phone call.
00:39:59.772,00:40:01.191,Mm. Take a message.
00:40:01.191,00:40:03.609,It's the chief of police.
00:40:03.609,00:40:06.196,He says he needs your help.

00:45:20.885,00:45:22.094,Why's that?
00:45:22.094,00:45:24.222,Good behavior.
00:45:24.222,00:45:26.098,Do you know what this is?
00:45:28.100,00:45:33.648,"Um, I'm guessing it's some kind of detonator-type deal."
00:45:33.648,00:45:36.693,There's 8 pounds of C-4 strapped to each and every one of 'em.
00:45:36.693,00:45:39.445,This is a spring-loaded dead-man switch.
00:45:39.445,00:45:41.239,If my thumb comes off it...
00:45:41.239,00:45:42.739,boom.
00:45:44.325,00:45:51.957,"And now, since we've had a little change of plan, between the police showing up and you sucking out all of my associates..."
00:45:51.957,00:45:54.377,I want you to break into the vault.
00:45:54.377,00:45:57.838,You'll find three quarter-ton pallets of small bills inside.

00:46:02.552,00:46:06.889,You are gonna get me safely away from here with the money...
00:46:06.889,00:46:10.226,or else they'll be cleaning up these hostages with a mop.
00:46:14.105,00:46:16.148,I'm gonna have to say no to that.
00:46:16.148,00:46:17.734,Uh...
00:46:19.235,00:46:21.654,I'm really trying to turn over a new leaf.
00:46:21.654,00:46:23.989,"I will blow up this entire building, you asshole."
00:46:26.992,00:46:29.662,Really don't like that word.
00:46:29.662,00:46:34.709,"I will blow them sky-high, and their blood will be on your hands."
00:46:38.045,00:46:40.339,"Do you hear me, asshole?"
00:46:48.847,00:46:51.684,Call me a asshole...
00:46:51.684,00:46:53.394,one more time.

00:48:23.025,00:48:25.194,"At the bank today, intense."
00:48:25.194,00:48:26.696,RAY: Smile.
00:48:30.783,00:48:32.785,"RAY: Hey. Boy, they'll let anybody in here, huh?"
00:48:32.785,00:48:34.328,"Hancock, meet these guys."
00:48:34.328,00:48:37.289,This is Mike Kilbourne-- Huge fan. Huge.
00:48:37.289,00:48:39.041,Gigantic fans. Insane.
00:48:39.041,00:48:40.959,These guys are partners at the biggest West Coast ad firm.
00:48:40.959,00:48:42.879,"Where you been, Ray?"
00:48:42.879,00:48:44.756,"Actually, I have called."
00:48:44.756,00:48:47.091,"Water under the bridge, man."
00:48:49.719,00:48:52.929,Could you guys get used to this or what?
00:48:54.807,00:48:56.726,How'd you two meet?
00:48:56.726,00:49:00.104,Um...I was married once before.
00:49:00.104,00:49:02.481,First wife...
00:49:02.481,00:49:05.067,"um, she died giving birth to Aaron."
00:49:06.694,00:49:08.153,It's another dinner.
00:49:08.153,00:49:11.198,"Um... But, um..."
00:49:11.198,00:49:13.868,So there I am. I'm-- I'm with this beautiful little baby.
00:49:13.868,00:49:15.870,I don't know what the hell to do.
00:49:15.870,00:49:18.372,And I was in the supermarket.
00:49:18.372,00:49:23.419,"And I'm in the baby aisle, and I've got a brand of diapers in each hand."
00:49:23.419,00:49:27.339,"I'm staring at them, but I-- You know, I don't know how I'm gonna get through the day."
00:49:29.007,00:49:30.342,An angel...
00:49:31.594,00:49:34.054,...sees me.
00:49:35.222,00:49:39.852,She knew. She was-- She gave me this look.
00:49:39.852,00:49:45.023,"And even in the trance I was in, I knew that somebody somewhere..."
00:49:45.023,00:49:47.318,was throwing me a little rope.
00:49:47.318,00:49:49.069,You know?
00:49:49.069,00:49:52.281,"Starting that day, you really put my life back together."
00:49:52.281,00:49:53.950,Right?
00:49:53.950,00:49:55.159,You're drunk.
00:49:55.159,00:49:56.494,So?
00:49:56.494,00:49:58.454,Come here.
00:50:03.292,00:50:05.252,"What about you, buddy?"
00:50:05.252,00:50:08.255,"You're from another planet, aren't you?"
00:50:08.255,00:50:09.882,"No, man. I'm from Miami."
00:50:09.882,00:50:12.927,"You didn't come in on, like, a meteor or--?"
00:50:12.927,00:50:15.011,"Nope. Woke up in a hospital, first thing I remember."
00:50:15.011,00:50:17.890,RAY: Government hospital.
00:50:17.890,00:50:23.103,"Experimenting on you and-- No, Ray. Regular old Miami emergency room."
00:50:23.103,00:50:24.355,Come on.
00:50:24.355,00:50:26.983,"Yeah, my, uh-- My skull was fractured."
00:50:26.983,00:50:30.611,"They told me I tried to, uh, stop a mugging."
00:50:30.611,00:50:32.571,Somebody knocked you out.
00:50:32.571,00:50:34.991,I guess I was a regular guy before...
00:50:34.991,00:50:38.452,"and when I woke up, I was changed."
00:50:38.452,00:50:39.996,Uh...
00:50:39.996,00:50:44.709,"and the hospital nurse tried to put a needle in my arm, and it just broke against my skin."
00:50:44.709,00:50:48.587,"And then my skull healed in, like, an hour."
00:50:48.587,00:50:51.590,The doctors were astounded...
00:50:51.590,00:50:54.010,"and, uh..."
00:50:54.010,00:50:56.971,they wanted to know my story. Just like you.
00:50:56.971,00:51:00.892,"But, uh, I couldn't tell 'em."
00:51:00.892,00:51:03.101,Amnesia.
00:51:03.101,00:51:05.604,"You know, the blow to the head."
00:51:05.604,00:51:06.981,"Yeah, well, that's what they figure."
00:51:06.981,00:51:09.107,You don't remember anything?
00:51:09.107,00:51:11.777,No.
00:51:11.777,00:51:17.157,Only thing I had in my pocket was bubble-gum...
00:51:17.157,00:51:19.326,two movie tickets.
00:51:19.326,00:51:22.997,Boris Karloff.
00:51:22.997,00:51:26.375,"Uh... But no ID, nothing."
00:51:26.375,00:51:29.670,I went to sign out.
00:51:26.375,00:51:31.422,"The, uh, nurse asked me for my John Hancock."
00:51:31.422,00:51:33.131,"And, uh..."
00:51:33.131,00:51:35.927,I actually thought that's who I was.
00:51:35.927,00:51:37.887,How come I didn't hear any of this?
00:51:37.887,00:51:40.056,I didn't read about it in any newspapers?
00:51:40.056,00:51:43.684,"Uh, it w-- It was probably in the papers, uh, 80 years ago."
00:51:43.684,00:51:45.728,Eighty years ago?
00:51:45.728,00:51:47.354,"Oh, I don't-- I don't age."
00:51:47.354,00:51:49.565,This is it.
00:51:49.565,00:51:51.191,"HANCOCK: Gotta wonder, though."
00:51:53.151,00:51:56.739,What kind of bastard must I have been...
00:52:00.242,00:52:02.536,that nobody was there to claim me?
00:52:06.999,00:52:09.293,"I mean, I'm-- I'm not the most..."
00:52:09.293,00:52:14.090,"charming guy in the world, so I've been told, but..."
00:52:15.883,00:52:17.760,nobody?
00:52:21.097,00:52:23.557,"RAY: That didn't tire you out at all, coming up the stairs?"
00:52:23.557,00:52:24.767,HANCOCK: Not really.
00:52:24.767,00:52:26.102,RAY: I'm real spinny.
00:52:26.102,00:52:27.937,Could've just flown me upstairs.
00:52:27.937,00:52:29.187,Whoo.
00:52:29.187,00:52:30.522,I could've done without that.
00:52:30.522,00:52:32.232,Get your shoes off here.
00:52:32.232,00:52:34.234,All right. That's all you're getting off of me though.
00:52:38.114,00:52:39.824,"You believe in me, don't you, Hancock?"
00:52:41.784,00:52:42.952,"Of course, Ray."
00:52:42.952,00:52:44.662,I believe in you.
00:52:47.790,00:52:52.210,"Listen to me. This is important, 'cause I believe in you, you know, and-- And..."
00:52:54.088,00:52:56.340,you're gonna do great.
00:52:58.843,00:53:01.012,And you're gonna fix everything.
00:53:04.849,00:53:06.266,"You get some sleep, Ray."
00:53:06.266,00:53:08.144,You sleep tight too.
00:53:09.436,00:53:12.148,Hancock. Tucking me in.
00:53:18.654,00:53:20.906,All right. He's asleep.
00:53:20.906,00:53:23.993,Damn babysitter never cleans up after herself.
00:53:36.421,00:53:38.174,You have a bruise on your hand.
00:53:41.510,00:53:45.723,You-- You should go.
00:53:51.062,00:53:53.355,Getting late.
00:54:18.380,00:54:21.133,If Ray finds out about me...
00:54:22.300,00:54:24.095,you're dead.
00:54:29.225,00:54:30.642,Is she...?
00:55:10.348,00:55:12.935,"MARY: Joan. We're gonna take care of that, okay?"
00:55:12.935,00:55:14.686,Don't you worry.
00:55:16.981,00:55:19.024,"Hi, honey."
00:55:19.024,00:55:21.359,Breakfast?
00:55:21.359,00:55:24.113,"Hancock sneezed, huh?"
00:55:24.113,00:55:25.864,Can you believe it? Achoo.
00:55:25.864,00:55:27.532,It's amazing that you slept through that.
00:55:27.532,00:55:28.993,You're a-- A good sleeper.
00:55:28.993,00:55:31.078,Holy shit.
00:55:31.078,00:55:34.081,"I'm not gonna say I told you so, but..."
00:55:34.081,00:55:37.417,You told me he was gonna sneeze a hole through the front of the house?
00:55:37.417,00:55:40.212,"I just said him being around-- Oh, sweetheart, can you get that?"
00:55:40.212,00:55:41.421,"Oh, thanks."
00:55:41.421,00:55:42.798,"Oh, God."
00:55:42.798,00:55:44.049,I got it.
00:55:44.049,00:55:46.510,But you don't worry about anything.
00:55:46.510,00:55:48.804,I already apologized to the neighbors...
00:55:48.804,00:55:50.014,called State Farm.
00:55:50.014,00:55:51.556,Everything is taken care of.
00:55:51.556,00:55:54.101,You just...
00:55:55.393,00:55:57.395,...enjoy that breakfast.
00:55:59.940,00:56:01.692,What's this? Are we going on vacation?
00:56:01.692,00:56:03.194,Mm-hm.
00:56:03.194,00:56:04.903,Just the three of us.
00:56:04.903,00:56:06.155,Tonight.
00:56:06.155,00:56:07.405,Let's go somewhere.
00:56:07.405,00:56:09.241,"HANCOCK: Knock, knock."
00:56:10.492,00:56:13.578,Gesundheit.
00:56:13.578,00:56:23.297,"MARY: I-- I was just telling Ray here, I hope you're done sneezing, because...I don't think our house could take much more of your sneezing."
00:56:29.469,00:56:31.972,"Yeah, sometimes, uh..."
00:56:31.972,00:56:34.266,I sneeze when there's dust...
00:56:36.643,00:56:39.188,or if I get really surprised.
00:56:39.188,00:56:41.523,That's unfortunate.
00:56:41.523,00:56:43.359,This is Kilbourne.
00:56:43.359,00:56:45.236,Mike? How you doing?
00:56:46.362,00:56:48.030,It was great to see you too.
00:56:48.030,00:56:49.365,Get away.
00:56:49.365,00:56:52.450,"Yep. Well, um..."
00:56:52.450,00:56:55.120,Right.
00:56:57.039,00:56:59.291,I got a pen right here.
00:56:59.291,00:57:01.626,"Right. No, I know."
00:57:07.091,00:57:08.550,It's right here in my hand.
00:57:13.347,00:57:15.099,Mm-hm.
00:57:16.808,00:57:18.894,I am...warning you.
00:57:18.894,00:57:20.520,"RAY: All right, go ahead."
00:57:23.857,00:57:25.901,"Okay, good."
00:57:25.901,00:57:28.195,"Now, um..."
00:57:28.195,00:57:29.905,"And that's still in 310, right?"
00:57:29.905,00:57:31.990,Hang on one second.
00:57:31.990,00:57:34.118,Do me a favor?
00:57:34.118,00:57:37.537,"I'm sorry, Mike. Yeah."
00:57:37.537,00:57:38.997,We're gonna talk.
00:57:38.997,00:57:40.374,RAY: Okay.
00:57:40.374,00:57:42.918,Go...away.
00:57:42.918,00:57:46.046,"RAY: Uh, well, it's something that I'm-- I'm really excited about."
00:57:46.046,00:57:47.672,I'm very excited.
00:57:57.975,00:58:00.060,I'm gonna do this all day.
00:58:00.060,00:58:01.937,"Bong, bong, bong."
00:58:01.937,00:58:04.273,Bong.
00:58:04.273,00:58:05.816,I-- I suppose...
00:58:05.816,00:58:08.235,Fine. We'll talk. Okay?
00:58:08.235,00:58:14.450,"And when we're done talking, you go away and you leave my family alone."
00:58:14.450,00:58:15.784,My place at 4:00.
00:58:15.784,00:58:17.077,Whatever.
00:58:18.287,00:58:20.038,"RAY: It means, uh..."
00:58:20.038,00:58:21.915,"Well, I'd rather not talk numbers now."
00:58:21.915,00:58:23.208,I'd like to save 'em for the pitch.
00:58:23.208,00:58:25.210,So let's just set a time.
00:58:25.210,00:58:26.962,That's good with me.
00:58:26.962,00:58:28.505,All right.
00:58:28.505,00:58:30.299,"Yeah, 3:30. Great."
00:58:31.591,00:58:34.261,"Hon, is it hot in here?"
00:58:55.157,00:58:58.160,He hurt you. Didn't he?
00:58:59.536,00:59:02.206,"Aw, use your words."
00:59:02.206,00:59:04.082,How did it make you feel?
00:59:07.627,00:59:09.004,Sore.
00:59:09.004,00:59:11.131,Bad.
00:59:11.131,00:59:12.508,Bad.
00:59:12.508,00:59:15.177,It's 'cause he took your power.
00:59:15.177,00:59:17.304,And you have to get your power back.
00:59:18.680,00:59:20.307,And no one will give you your power back.
00:59:20.307,00:59:23.268,You have to go out and take it.
00:59:23.268,00:59:25.145,You understand me?
00:59:27.064,00:59:29.191,We're gonna go find Hancock...
00:59:30.650,00:59:31.818,and get your power back.
01:00:13.777,01:00:15.820,Ask.
01:00:17.781,01:00:19.741,You and I.
01:00:19.741,01:00:22.286,We're the same.
01:00:22.286,01:00:24.580,I'm stronger.
01:00:24.580,01:00:26.790,HANCOCK: Really?
01:00:29.585,01:00:32.254,"Oh, yeah."
01:00:32.254,01:00:34.256,HANCOCK: Who are we?
01:00:34.256,01:00:37.217,"Gods, angels."
01:00:37.217,01:00:39.010,Different cultures call us by different names.
01:00:39.010,01:00:42.139,"Now, all of a sudden, it's superhero."
01:00:42.139,01:00:43.974,Are there more of us?
01:00:43.974,01:00:46.310,There were.
01:00:46.310,01:00:47.644,They all died.
01:00:49.104,01:00:52.107,It's just the two of us.
01:01:00.740,01:01:02.576,What is this?
01:01:05.829,01:01:08.582,Who are we to each other?
01:01:08.582,01:01:11.960,We're brother and sister.
01:01:11.960,01:01:13.920,"No, I'm your sister."
01:01:13.920,01:01:15.255,I'm your sister.
01:01:15.255,01:01:16.923,No.
01:01:15.255,01:01:19.259,Sisters don't kiss brothers the way you kissed me last night.
01:01:19.259,01:01:20.594,You're lying. Deal's off.
01:01:20.594,01:01:22.846,Let's go see how Ray feels about this.
01:01:22.846,01:01:25.182,MARY: Get your ass back here!
01:01:25.182,01:01:27.476,HANCOCK: I'm telling!
01:01:33.148,01:01:35.817,The AllHeart symbol will be known globally...
01:01:35.817,01:01:42.324,as a symbol that represents companies that are committed to changing the world.
01:01:42.324,01:01:47.412,"They can give away their sustenance goods, okay-- food, drugs, power, clothing --for free."
01:01:47.412,01:01:50.748,I thought we were talking about Hancock-- Number two.
01:02:01.092,01:02:03.094,You stay away from me and my family.
01:02:03.094,01:02:05.597,You are not gonna do this to me again.
01:02:05.597,01:02:07.098,What?
01:02:07.098,01:02:08.559,I don't know what you're talking about.
01:02:08.559,01:02:09.767,Hey.
01:02:09.767,01:02:11.102,"WOMAN: I love you, Hancock!"
01:02:11.102,01:02:12.604,It can't work.
01:02:12.604,01:02:14.690,Always ends the same way.
01:02:14.690,01:02:17.192,"Persia, Greece, Brooklyn."
01:02:17.192,01:02:19.319,Brooklyn? I've never been to Brooklyn.
01:02:19.319,01:02:24.074,"I have put up with your bullshit for the last 3000 years, and I am done!"
01:02:22.155,01:02:25.867,I don't know what you're talk-- Done! You listen.
01:02:24.074,01:02:27.952,"I don't know what you're talk-- I am happy, okay."
01:02:27.952,01:02:29.996,Look at me!
01:02:29.996,01:02:31.831,I don't know what you're talking about!
01:02:31.831,01:02:38.463,"I hate to burst your little crazy-lady bubble, but it must not have been all that great, 'cause I don't remember you."
01:02:44.094,01:02:46.054,Call me crazy...
01:02:47.556,01:02:49.849,one more time.
01:02:49.849,01:02:51.518,Cuckoo.
01:03:00.527,01:03:02.195,"All right, hold it."
01:03:02.195,01:03:04.531,Better not hit me with that truck.
01:03:06.074,01:03:12.122,"For companies to qualify for the AllHeart symbol, they must prove they are a leader in the global revolution-- We wanna talk about Mr. Hancock."
01:03:12.122,01:03:13.915,They are committed to a better world.
01:03:13.915,01:03:15.500,They can do this in four different ways.
01:03:15.500,01:04:02.380,This is how-- But the most important thing with AllHeart is brand recognition.
01:04:02.380,01:04:06.468,"That's why I've mocked up these examples here in Tokyo, London, Dubai, Paris."
01:04:20.231,01:04:21.858,So we need maximum exposure.
01:04:21.858,01:04:23.777,We need extreme market-- Is it snowing?
01:04:38.249,01:04:40.126,MARY: Get off.
01:04:40.126,01:04:41.670,Get off me!
01:04:41.670,01:04:44.840,I hate you!
01:04:47.718,01:04:48.968,Whoever I am.
01:04:48.968,01:04:51.555,Whatever I did-- Look at me.
01:04:53.097,01:04:56.100,I'm sorry.
01:05:30.677,01:05:31.928,Why were you flying?
01:05:31.928,01:05:35.306,"You were flying, Mary."
01:05:35.306,01:05:36.683,"Yeah, she was definitely flying."
01:05:36.683,01:05:39.143,"Okay, I was flying."
01:05:39.143,01:05:41.938,And I'm very strong as well.
01:05:41.938,01:05:43.398,It's just the way we are.
01:05:43.398,01:05:45.024,Me and him.
01:05:45.024,01:05:46.984,The others paired up and died.
01:05:46.984,01:05:50.071,"Oh, you didn't say anything about the others pairing up, at the trailer."
01:05:50.071,01:05:51.281,You were at his trailer.
01:05:51.281,01:05:52.824,This is very hard to explain.
01:05:52.824,01:05:53.950,"Great, I'm all ears, Mary."
01:05:53.950,01:05:55.493,Me too.
01:05:55.493,01:05:57.412,Just give me and my wife one moment.
01:05:57.412,01:05:58.705,"Hey, don't-- Don't bring it here."
01:05:58.705,01:06:00.206,"The adults are talking, for one second."
01:06:00.206,01:06:02.083,MARY: Technically speaking...
01:06:03.752,01:06:05.796,he's my husband.
01:06:05.796,01:06:08.548,Holy shit.
01:06:08.548,01:06:09.758,What?
01:06:09.758,01:06:11.635,We broke up decades ago.
01:06:11.635,01:06:13.470,Long before you were born.
01:06:13.470,01:06:14.846,He just can't remember.
01:06:14.846,01:06:16.514,But you can. Right?
01:06:16.514,01:06:18.266,You knew?
01:06:18.266,01:06:20.811,That's something you might want to bring up on a first date.
01:06:20.811,01:06:23.229,I don't like to travel.
01:06:23.229,01:06:25.106,I'm immortal. Okay?
01:06:23.229,01:06:26.858,Those are some of the things you might want to give a heads-up on.
01:06:26.858,01:06:29.402,"Whatever we are, we were built in twos, okay?"
01:06:29.402,01:06:30.946,We're drawn to each other.
01:06:30.946,01:06:33.531,"No matter how far I run, he's always there."
01:06:33.531,01:06:35.325,He finds me.
01:06:35.325,01:06:36.576,What are you saying?
01:06:36.576,01:06:38.161,That you two are fated to be together?
01:06:38.161,01:06:41.247,"I've lived for a very long time, Ray."
01:06:41.247,01:06:46.711,And the one thing I learned: Fate doesn't decide everything.
01:06:46.711,01:06:48.880,People get to choose.
01:06:48.880,01:06:50.507,And you chose...
01:06:50.507,01:06:53.677,to let me think I was here alone.
01:07:03.645,01:07:06.397,I didn't think you'd miss what you didn't remember.
01:07:07.524,01:07:08.900,RAY: Great.
01:07:08.900,01:07:10.360,Now what?
01:07:15.532,01:07:17.158,Didn't plan for this.
01:07:40.390,01:07:49.566,"Prison authorities confirmed that the prisoner uprising was led by Kenneth Red Parker Jr., who was also the leader of last week's Spring Street bank robbery."
01:07:49.566,01:07:51.818,At least eight prisoners are not accounted for.
01:07:51.818,01:07:54.111,More information on the prison riot in Norwalk.
01:07:54.111,01:07:57.866,Construction workers at the prison were attacked and knocked unconscious.
01:07:57.866,01:08:03.120,"Prisoners stole the workers' clothes, and it is feared that at least some of them have escaped."
01:08:03.120,01:08:05.540,Parker is considered a criminal mastermind.
01:08:05.540,01:08:10.962,He is very effective at using psychological persuasion to organize criminals from different backgrounds.
01:08:10.962,01:08:14.465,He is a former psychology professor from Stanford University.
01:08:14.465,01:08:21.138,"While there, he organized a notorious criminal network comprised of graduate students from diverse-- Ninety-one ten."
01:08:21.138,01:08:24.475,Ninety-one ten?
01:08:24.475,01:08:26.102,Ninety-one ten.
01:08:26.102,01:08:27.979,Highway robbery.
01:08:52.503,01:08:53.838,What?
01:08:53.838,01:08:55.131,I'm taking the money.
01:08:56.466,01:08:58.134,Uh-huh.
01:09:02.013,01:09:04.099,I can relate to that.
01:09:05.475,01:09:08.103,"You know, if you want something..."
01:09:09.353,01:09:13.190,nobody can stop you from taking it.
01:09:13.190,01:09:14.985,"You just take it, right?"
01:09:17.194,01:09:18.571,I like that.
01:09:20.448,01:09:21.741,But can you take it?
01:09:24.535,01:09:27.080,My Zagnut bar versus your gun.
01:09:34.504,01:09:36.255,Sorry about your window.
01:10:23.386,01:10:25.055,MALE DOCTOR: Get out of the way!
01:10:25.055,01:10:27.182,FEMALE DOCTOR: Clear. I need Room 1020.
01:10:29.893,01:10:36.232,"I need IV line, blood quality, CBC, electrolytes, a PT-- HANCOCK: It's not gonna work."
01:10:36.232,01:10:38.109,It's not gonna work.
01:10:38.109,01:10:39.777,I'm in.
01:10:39.777,01:10:41.738,What's happening?
01:10:44.115,01:10:45.700,This just in.
01:10:45.700,01:10:49.286,John Hancock has been rushed to Los Angeles General Hospital.
01:10:49.286,01:10:52.665,Hancock is in serious condition with multiple gunshot wounds.
01:10:52.665,01:10:58.088,"No story yet as to how this happened to him, but we will continue to cover this story live, as it unfolds."
01:10:58.088,01:10:59.172,Reporting live from L.A....
01:11:07.138,01:11:09.557,"REPORTER 1: Mr. Embrey, just a couple of questions."
01:11:09.557,01:11:11.642,"Just a couple of questions, please."
01:11:11.642,01:11:15.980,"Uh, from what I've heard, uh, he was trying to stop a robbery."
01:11:15.980,01:11:18.566,Do you know if special ammunition was used in the gun that shot him?
01:11:18.566,01:11:20.110,No.
01:11:20.110,01:11:21.736,"No, no. Nope, not that I'm aware of."
01:11:21.736,01:11:23.905,Could this have to do with the mysterious superwoman?
01:11:23.905,01:11:25.990,He was seen battling her.
01:11:25.990,01:11:28.492,Could this woman be more powerful than Hancock?
01:11:33.164,01:11:36.042,"Here are the lab results, Room 209."
01:12:03.486,01:12:05.655,You're becoming mortal.
01:12:06.948,01:12:09.242,It's us.
01:12:09.242,01:12:12.245,Being close to each other.
01:12:12.245,01:12:15.123,It's never happened this fast before.
01:12:17.834,01:12:20.377,You have to leave.
01:12:20.377,01:12:24.090,"The further away you get from me, the better you're gonna feel."
01:12:24.090,01:12:26.926,"You'll start getting your powers back, and..."
01:12:26.926,01:12:32.348,"you're gonna be flying and breaking things, and saving people before you know it."
01:12:45.736,01:12:47.697,"Oh, it's like I said."
01:12:48.906,01:12:50.533,We were built in pairs.
01:12:50.533,01:12:53.619,And when we get...
01:12:53.619,01:12:58.166,"close to our opposites, we lose our power."
01:12:58.166,01:12:59.458,Why?
01:12:59.458,01:13:03.087,So we can live human lives.
01:13:03.087,01:13:05.631,"Love, connect."
01:13:07.050,01:13:10.178,Grow old...die.
01:13:11.679,01:13:13.681,What happened...
01:13:13.681,01:13:15.141,to us?
01:13:18.311,01:13:21.397,Summer of 4 B.C.
01:13:21.397,01:13:24.234,"We were becoming mortal, like now."
01:13:25.568,01:13:28.363,They came after me with swords.
01:13:31.490,01:13:33.701,But you saved me.
01:13:36.996,01:13:39.832,Eighteen fifty.
01:13:39.832,01:13:42.960,They set our house on fire.
01:13:42.960,01:13:46.172,You pulled me out of the flames.
01:13:47.924,01:13:50.134,Eighty years ago.
01:13:51.135,01:13:53.637,What happened then?
01:13:53.637,01:13:56.974,We were living in Miami.
01:13:56.974,01:14:00.561,And a new movie was playing in town.
01:14:00.561,01:14:01.979,Frankenstein.
01:14:05.108,01:14:07.777,And after...
01:14:07.777,01:14:13.324,"we walked down Flagler Street, and you took my hand, and you held it so tight."
01:14:20.081,01:14:23.167,And they attacked us in an alley.
01:14:26.629,01:14:28.214,They hit you so hard.
01:14:28.214,01:14:31.134,There was so much blood.
01:14:31.134,01:14:35.554,They wouldn't let me ride in the ambulance with you.
01:14:35.554,01:14:40.476,"And by the time I got to the hospital, you were awake."
01:14:45.148,01:14:46.983,But you didn't know me.
01:14:49.277,01:14:51.570,So I left.
01:14:52.655,01:14:56.075,Every time we're together...
01:14:56.075,01:14:58.619,they come after you through me.
01:15:11.924,01:15:17.430,You're built to save people more than the rest of us.
01:15:17.430,01:15:19.556,You're a hero.
01:15:21.017,01:15:23.853,An insurance policy of the gods.
01:15:23.853,01:15:26.272,Keep one alive.
01:15:26.272,01:15:27.523,You.
01:15:27.523,01:15:30.193,To protect this world.
01:15:42.205,01:15:44.248,Get down.
01:15:46.792,01:15:48.794,Mary!
01:15:50.880,01:15:52.131,Mary!
01:15:52.131,01:15:53.341,Stay down!
01:15:53.341,01:15:55.134,Okay.
01:16:05.686,01:16:07.355,Mary?!
01:16:20.410,01:16:21.994,Stop.
01:16:24.621,01:16:27.583,"WOMAN: Oh, no! No! Please!"
01:16:30.920,01:16:32.255,Aah!
01:16:36.842,01:16:38.469,Stay down.
01:16:50.106,01:16:52.108,RAY: Hey! Mary!
01:16:52.108,01:16:54.610,"Let's go, get her up."
01:16:54.610,01:16:56.153,"Come on, Chuck."
01:17:04.036,01:17:05.162,Gordon. One IV.
01:17:05.162,01:17:06.539,MAN: Here! Help in here!
01:17:07.873,01:17:09.250,"Hold her down, hold her down."
01:17:13.254,01:17:14.589,Hold her down.
01:17:21.387,01:17:22.721,Hold her.
01:17:33.065,01:17:34.358,Stay calm.
01:17:50.583,01:17:53.127,"Hold her, hold her, hold her."
01:18:27.119,01:18:30.164,"Upon us all, Hancock."
01:18:31.248,01:18:33.000,You're no different.
01:18:36.712,01:18:39.590,"Time to shut her down, Hancock."
01:18:40.675,01:18:42.635,It's been a nice run.
01:19:11.163,01:19:13.832,"Oh, we are all..."
01:19:13.832,01:19:15.626,sincerely gonna miss you.
01:19:17.378,01:19:19.422,But it is time for you to move on.
01:19:22.966,01:19:25.177,And maybe to a happier place.
01:19:27.888,01:19:30.600,You can thank me if you want to...
01:19:31.767,01:19:33.561,superhero.
01:19:38.357,01:19:40.610,Aah!

01:23:04.855,01:23:08.066,Completely cross-eyed.
01:23:08.066,01:23:09.485,Cross-eyed?
01:23:09.485,01:23:11.904,"All right. What about uh, Queen Elizabeth?"
01:23:11.904,01:23:14.406,"Mm, needy."

01:23:20.162,01:23:22.372,"Mm, oh, yeah."
01:23:22.372,01:23:23.916,Not like that.
01:23:23.916,01:23:25.918,Really?
01:23:25.918,01:23:27.127,"Yeah, hang on."
01:23:28.337,01:23:29.672,RAY: Hello?
01:23:29.672,01:23:31.089,Ray.
01:23:31.089,01:23:33.342,"Hey, I've been trying to call you."
01:23:33.342,01:23:35.469,"Yeah, I was out of cell range."
01:23:36.846,01:23:38.973,Are you outside?
01:23:38.973,01:23:40.808,Yeah.

01:24:06.124,01:24:09.252,"Oh, my God, Ray."
01:24:09.252,01:24:12.673,"Hey. Oh, look up."
01:24:12.673,01:24:14.466,Hancock.

01:24:20.597,01:24:22.140,Thanks.
01:24:23.809,01:24:25.978,Will I get in trouble for that?
01:24:27.312,01:24:29.272,Huh?
01:25:42.345,01:25:43.806,"POLICEMAN 1: Freeze! Freeze, right there!"
01:25:43.806,01:25:45.140,POLICEMAN 2: Don't move!

01:26:01.281,01:26:02.699,Just-- Just tell me what you need.
01:26:02.699,01:26:05.452,Tell them cops to turn-- Tell 'em to take their guns off of me.
01:26:05.452,01:26:06.829,Tell 'em to take the guns up off of me.
01:26:06.829,01:26:08.371,"Just take them off, guys."
01:26:08.371,01:26:10.791,Lower your weapons.
01:26:10.791,01:26:13.794,With that tight-ass Wolverine outfit on.
01:26:13.794,01:26:17.006,"Now, let's make it happen, asshole."
