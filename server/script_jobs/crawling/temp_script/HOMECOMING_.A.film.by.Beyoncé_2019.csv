00:17:36.180,00:17:39.433,Then they got it. They just now getting it. Got it.
00:17:39.516,00:17:43.062,"Okay, so can we see if it's a good time to do that?"
00:17:43.145,00:17:44.438,They can be here till eight.

01:42:01.240,01:42:04.618,She's the best and I only deal with number ones. Ya heard?
00:00:37.954,00:00:41.791,welcome to Beyoncé Homecoming 2018.
00:04:55.253,00:04:58.589,Beyoncé! Beyoncé! Beyoncé!
00:04:58.673,00:05:01.301,Beyoncé! Beyoncé! Beyoncé!
00:07:33.619,00:07:37.665,"Coachella, y'all dance with me. Come on. Hey!"
00:07:56.642,00:07:57.643,Ha!
00:14:12.893,00:14:13.894,Come on!
00:14:24.738,00:14:25.698,Hey!
00:15:27.551,00:15:28.552,Do you slay?
00:16:17.184,00:16:19.979,why am I so insistent upon...
00:16:21.647,00:16:34.410,"giving out to them that Blackness, that Black Power, that Black-- Pushing them to identify with, uh, Black culture."
00:16:34.493,00:16:36.495,I think that is what you're asking.
00:16:38.330,00:16:40.541,I have no choice over it in the first place.
00:16:40.624,00:16:45.087,"To me, we are the most beautiful creatures in the whole world; Black people."
00:16:47.631,00:17:04.148,"My job is to somehow make them curious enough, or persuade them, by hook or crook, to get more aware of themselves and where they came from and what they are into, and what is already there and just to bring it out."
00:17:04.231,00:17:07.860,This is what compels me to compel them.
00:17:07.943,00:17:10.571,And I will do it by whatever means necessary.
00:17:13.073,00:17:14.783,Which one do you think is better?
00:17:21.623,00:17:22.541,Okay.
00:17:24.460,00:17:30.215,"the people who haven't seen the show, like seen the run-through over there, are super unclear on what the vibe is."
00:17:33.844,00:17:34.762,I'm with you.
00:17:52.696,00:17:54.281,visiting Prairie View.
00:17:54.364,00:18:02.790,"We rehearsed at TSU for many years in Third Ward, and I always dreamed of going to an HBCU."
00:18:04.041,00:18:06.627,My college was Destiny's Child.
00:18:06.710,00:18:10.339,"My college was traveling around the world, and life was my teacher."
00:18:12.758,00:18:14.635,I wanted a Black orchestra.
00:18:15.385,00:18:19.098,"I wanted the steppers, I needed the vocalists."
00:18:19.181,00:18:21.975,I wanted different characters; I didn't want us all doing the same thing.
00:18:22.893,00:18:27.648,And the amount of swag is just limitless. Like...
00:18:29.024,00:18:35.697,"the things that these young people can do with their bodies, and the music they can play, and..."
00:18:35.989,00:18:39.952,"the drumrolls, and the haircuts, and the bodies, and the..."
00:18:40.244,00:18:41.495,It's just not right.
00:18:41.578,00:18:44.915,It's just so much damn swag.
00:18:44.998,00:18:48.794,"It's just gorgeous, and it makes me proud. And, um..."
00:18:50.254,00:18:57.469,I wanted every person that has ever been dismissed because of the way they look to feel like they were on that stage.
00:18:57.553,00:18:59.596,Killing 'em. Killing 'em.
00:19:00.305,00:19:02.349,"And I want this to be, uh..."
00:19:03.183,00:19:10.607,"an experience where we all have growth, we all have to push ourselves and have to dig deep inside of ourselves to become better human beings."
00:19:11.108,00:19:14.570,And I wanna start off with a prayer.
00:19:17.573,00:19:18.532,All right.
00:19:19.074,00:19:21.410,"God, thank you so much for everyone here."
00:19:22.077,00:19:25.581,Thank you for bringing all of these human beings into my life.
00:19:26.290,00:19:29.626,"God, I ask that this is an experience that..."
00:19:31.003,00:19:32.754,we all remember forever.
00:19:33.338,00:19:36.300,I ask that we're able to touch people and give them hope.
00:19:37.009,00:19:39.720,"To make people feel beautiful, strong..."
00:19:40.596,00:19:41.763,and united.
00:19:42.222,00:19:44.391,"God, I ask that you just use us."
00:19:45.100,00:19:48.187,"I ask that we all grow, and we all connect."
00:19:49.438,00:19:51.857,"And Lord, thank you so much for choosing us."
00:19:51.940,00:19:54.651,Thank you for bringing everyone here into my life.
00:19:55.569,00:19:57.905,"We give you all the praise and glory, amen."
00:20:06.246,00:20:08.332,"and just, we have so much to learn."
00:20:08.415,00:20:17.841,"'Cause we're here to rehearse, and eventually we'll get on that stage and just let it all go, and feel the spirit and have us a good time."
00:20:18.091,00:20:23.889,"But, right now, it's still janky, and we got so much to learn and work out."
00:20:23.972,00:20:29.603,"So I wanted us to feel each other's energy, and dance, and scream, and holler, and hoot."
00:20:29.686,00:20:31.480,Do whatever we feel naturally.
00:20:31.563,00:20:33.774,And we're gonna build this thing together.
00:20:33.857,00:20:35.651,So let's just do it.
00:20:56.630,00:20:58.090,Let me hear you sing.
00:21:41.341,00:21:42.175,Bug a Boos.
00:21:46.138,00:21:47.556,I need a good laugh.
00:21:53.812,00:21:54.646,You.
00:21:57.107,00:21:58.317,Make me laugh.
00:21:59.401,00:22:00.610,Bug a Boos!
00:22:05.490,00:22:07.409,"Ah, ah, ah!"
00:22:11.413,00:22:12.497,"We got you, right?"
00:22:20.464,00:22:21.882,Did that make us laugh?
00:22:24.134,00:22:25.260,Think about it.
00:22:25.802,00:22:26.887,Bug a Boos!
00:22:34.936,00:22:36.021,Fall in line.
00:22:40.150,00:22:41.193,Ladies.
00:22:44.029,00:22:45.072,Ladies.
00:22:48.033,00:22:49.034,Ladies.
00:22:52.871,00:22:53.955,Are we smart?
00:22:56.583,00:22:57.793,Are we strong?
00:23:00.379,00:23:02.881,Have we had enough of the bullshit?
00:23:05.675,00:23:06.760,Show me.
00:23:13.058,00:23:14.976,On my balls!
00:23:17.979,00:23:20.357,Suck on my balls!
00:23:21.650,00:23:24.194,"Suck on my balls, bitch!"
00:23:24.277,00:23:25.404,Suck...
00:23:27.072,00:23:29.032,On my balls!
00:23:30.117,00:23:32.327,"Suck on my balls, pause!"
00:23:34.913,00:23:36.331,Had enough!
00:23:38.750,00:23:39.751,Hell nah!
00:23:40.168,00:23:41.628,Middle fingers up!
00:23:47.884,00:23:49.344,Wave 'em in his face!
00:23:59.396,00:25:45.377,"Tell him boy, bye Tell him, tell him boy, bye Tell him boy, bye Tell him, tell him boy, bye I see you. How did you do that so fast? She has on my outfit, y'all."
00:25:56.179,00:25:57.264,"Sing it, ladies."
00:26:02.477,00:26:03.311,"Right, ladies?"
00:28:04.974,00:28:06.309,Coachella!
00:28:08.269,00:28:10.897,Thank y'all so much for having us once again.
00:28:12.023,00:28:14.401,I'm so honored to be on this stage tonight.
00:28:15.735,00:28:17.987,This next song is for all of my queens.
00:28:18.905,00:28:21.825,Do we have any beautiful queens in the house tonight?
00:28:21.908,00:28:24.160,I want y'all to sing along if you know the lyrics.
00:28:24.244,00:28:26.287,It's called Bow Down.
00:28:59.821,00:29:01.030,Hey!
00:29:20.216,00:29:46.951,Coming up Coming down Listen.
00:31:51.576,00:32:02.962,"instead of me pulling out my flower crown, it was more important that I brought our culture to Coachella."
00:32:17.936,00:32:26.611,of rehearsals with Derek and the band before we started the four months of dance rehearsals.
00:32:26.694,00:32:31.032,The music and those vocal rehearsals-- that's the heartbeat of the show.
00:32:38.289,00:32:51.594,"I wanted all of these different characters, and I wanted it to feel the way I felt when I went to battle of the bands, because I grew up seeing those shows, and that being the highlight of my year."
00:32:59.018,00:33:04.190,"Five, swipe, right, left, swipe, step, clap."
00:33:08.987,00:33:19.622,"and I put every mistake, all of my triumphs, of my 22-year career into my two-hour homecoming performance."
00:33:34.053,00:33:45.648,"and caring about current events, and caring about what, you know, her people are going through, and wanting to shed light, and wanting to put, you know, a proud moment on stage for us, it gives you a boost. It's like, Wow!"
00:33:59.996,00:34:02.999,"Let's get it together. Let's move forward, let's unify."
00:34:03.082,00:34:05.668,All of those things existed in this performance.
00:34:16.679,00:34:22.894,and it literally felt like we were in our own university and struggling together.
00:34:22.977,00:34:25.188,The hours were unbelievable.
00:34:34.238,00:34:38.034,"And just to hear the energy in all the stops, and..."
00:34:38.117,00:34:45.833,"to feel the shaking of the risers on the pyramid, to hear the harmonies live was just as entertaining."
00:36:55.671,00:36:57.173,"Coachella, I wanna hear y'all sing."
00:37:24.200,00:37:25.785,How y'all doing over here?
00:37:34.210,00:37:37.296,I can see you all the way. All the way back there.
00:37:52.395,00:37:53.271,"Sing it, y'all!"
00:37:54.563,00:37:55.481,Sing.
00:41:07.423,00:41:09.425,"Say, I'm-a a diva. Sing it."
00:41:17.057,00:41:18.893,Can't hear you. I'm-a a diva.
00:41:20.519,00:41:21.353,Come on.
00:41:24.398,00:41:26.150,"Ooh, ah, ah!"
00:42:23.165,00:42:25.125,"Divas, y'all help me sing this next verse?"
00:42:25.209,00:42:26.043,Here we go.
00:44:37.675,00:44:38.592,But...
00:44:39.718,00:44:43.013,I got pregnant unexpectedly.
00:44:46.850,00:44:53.023,"And it ended up being twins, which was even more of a surprise."
00:44:54.400,00:44:58.153,My body went through more than I knew it could.
00:45:06.245,00:45:08.664,I had an extremely difficult pregnancy.
00:45:08.747,00:45:20.968,"I had high blood pressure, I developed toxemia, preeclampsia, and, in the womb, one of my babies' heartbeat paused a few times, so I had to get an emergency C-section."
00:45:30.728,00:45:32.521,"There is a yearning in it, you know?"
00:45:32.604,00:45:38.110,"Something special, mystical, hopeful, restful."
00:45:55.711,00:45:58.464,That go: I been getting to.
00:46:01.759,00:46:04.762,"on the stage, after giving birth."
00:46:04.845,00:46:07.347,I'm creating my own homecoming.
00:46:10.142,00:46:11.393,And it's hard.
00:46:13.103,00:46:17.107,"There were days that I thought, you know, I'd never be the same."
00:46:17.191,00:46:21.195,"I'd never be the same physically, my strength and endurance would never be the same."
00:46:27.117,00:46:32.873,"It's true. And, eventually, I wanna be able to do SoulCycle, the stairs, and rehearse in a day."
00:46:37.795,00:46:41.173,"is about feeling, so it's not as technical."
00:46:42.257,00:46:45.427,It's your own personality that brings it to life.
00:46:45.969,00:46:49.681,And that's hard when you don't feel like yourself.
00:46:55.229,00:46:58.649,I had to rebuild my body from cut muscles.
00:46:59.358,00:47:04.738,"It took me a while to feel confident enough to freak it, and give it my own personality."
00:47:25.592,00:47:28.428,"Just, internally, my body was not connected."
00:47:28.512,00:47:30.973,My mind was not there.
00:47:31.056,00:47:33.767,My mind wanted to be with my children.
00:47:34.059,00:47:36.645,What people don't see is the sacrifice.
00:47:41.692,00:47:48.657,"I would dance, and go off to the trailer, and breastfeed the babies, and the days I could, I would bring the children."
00:48:03.630,00:48:05.132,"Like, it gets messy."
00:48:06.258,00:48:08.552,"Like, it's this-- I'm not even joking, this fast."
00:48:08.635,00:48:09.469,Yes.
00:48:50.928,00:48:54.473,"Five, six. Five, six, let's go."
00:49:09.196,00:49:10.072,Hup!
00:49:13.825,00:49:14.910,is going now.
00:49:20.290,00:49:30.342,"I'm limiting myself to no bread, no carbs, no sugar, no dairy, no meat, no fish, no alcohol."
00:49:35.347,00:49:47.693,"Just trying to figure out how to balance being a mother of a six-year-old and of twins that need me and giving myself creatively and, um, physically."
00:49:47.776,00:49:49.319,It was a lot to juggle.
00:49:51.154,00:49:55.409,"It's not like before, when I could rehearse, you know, 15 hours straight."
00:49:55.701,00:50:00.288,"I have children, I have a husband. I have to take care of my body."
00:50:01.081,00:50:02.124,There she is.
00:50:04.876,00:50:06.712,"Hi, my babies!"
00:50:07.879,00:50:11.216,"Hi, Baba! Hi, baby!"
00:50:11.883,00:50:14.219,"Hi, this is me!"
00:50:23.687,00:50:32.279,And I've learned a very valuable lesson-- ...never push myself that far again.
00:50:35.657,00:50:44.041,"I feel like I'm just a new-- A new woman, in a new chapter of my life, and I'm not even trying to be who I was."
00:50:44.124,00:50:46.126,It's just so beautiful that children...
00:50:46.877,00:50:48.128,do that to you.
00:50:57.929,00:51:00.599,"Okay, this is seriously a huge accomplishment."
00:51:00.682,00:51:05.145,"Because I did not think I'd ever get back in my old costume, and I'm actually in it."
00:51:05.228,00:51:06.772,And I can still move...
00:51:06.855,00:51:12.819,"I still have a ways to go, but this makes me feel good, 'cause I've been sacrificing and working hard."
00:51:48.480,00:51:49.606,All right!
00:51:49.689,00:51:50.899,Big deal!
00:51:51.149,00:51:52.984,-All right! -It's zipped.
00:52:55.005,00:54:41.486,"Woke up with the crown.I Twins, tell 'em."
00:54:59.713,00:55:00.922,How are y'all feeling?
00:55:03.300,00:55:04.509,Coachella.
00:55:05.135,00:55:06.720,How did you wake up this morning?
00:55:17.647,00:55:20.150,All right. I want y'all to repeat after me.
00:55:22.485,00:55:23.361,Say it.
00:56:07.614,00:56:14.913,"after she done the decks, Coachella gotta rename Coachella to Beychella."
00:56:17.207,00:56:20.543,New name alert: Beychella.
00:56:26.299,00:56:29.469,"Y'all know this one, I want y'all to sing along."
00:56:29.552,00:56:31.388,"And bop, and bop."
00:56:32.430,00:56:33.264,Bop.
01:00:32.837,01:00:37.634,"I'm Bug a Boo Daddy, aka Me, Myself..."
01:00:38.301,01:00:40.595,"Yo, let's take a group pic, bro. Come on, come on."

01:00:58.029,01:00:59.280,Also known as...
01:01:09.874,01:01:17.632,I'm Bug a-- ...Blow.
01:01:23.971,01:01:27.266,"I'm Bug a Boo Disappear, also known as..."
01:01:27.392,01:01:28.393,Where'd he go?
01:01:43.032,01:01:46.327,I'm Bug a Boo Rocket.
01:01:47.203,01:01:48.246,also known as...
01:02:34.625,01:02:35.835,Whoo!
01:02:37.754,01:02:38.921,Let's!
01:02:41.090,01:02:42.091,Let's!
01:02:43.509,01:02:44.343,Break it down!
01:02:47.430,01:02:49.432,Hey! Yeah!
01:02:49.766,01:02:51.434,-Let's go! -Hey!
01:03:01.944,01:03:03.863,Hey! Hey! Hey!
01:03:04.238,01:03:08.576,Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Let's go!
01:05:27.548,01:05:29.717,"grew up in Atlanta, and..."
01:05:29.800,01:05:34.639,this dream is something that I never could dream up for myself.
01:05:34.722,01:05:36.599,I couldn't dream this big at all.
01:05:36.682,01:05:41.062,"I never thought I would be here, thought I would be too short, too thick."
01:05:42.647,01:05:47.443,"Actually, my whole family went to Morehouse and Spelman, which are HBCUs in Atlanta."
01:05:48.736,01:05:50.112,So to do this and...
01:05:50.655,01:05:55.493,"to have, you know, the Pan and, you know, sororities and things that..."
01:05:56.118,01:06:00.957,Black families value up on a stage for the world to see and understand us a little bit more...
01:06:01.874,01:06:03.167,It's just all a blessing.
01:06:04.752,01:06:10.299,"I just toss it up, and catch it in my spirit first, and then real life second."
01:06:13.302,01:06:22.269,"another woman or a young girl might see a reflection of herself; of her worth, of her boundless potential."
01:06:30.361,01:06:33.155,Go forth. Let them know we're real.
01:06:39.495,01:06:41.414,I waited 37 weeks...
01:06:42.206,01:06:43.457,to be here.
01:06:44.000,01:06:45.376,"Being pregnant, so..."
01:06:45.459,01:06:47.169,I didn't dance for a year.
01:06:48.963,01:07:02.184,"Looking out there into that crowd, I was overwhelmed and I feel so honored and so great being a part of something so epic, that my son can watch when he's older and..."
01:07:02.935,01:07:06.689,"identify with the people, identify with the culture."
01:07:07.481,01:07:16.574,"And I'm just so honored to be a part of something that he can watch, and be proud of me, and say, My mom was a part of that, my mom did that."
01:07:21.078,01:07:25.624,I was the first African-American woman to headline Coachella.
01:07:25.958,01:07:34.759,It was important to me that everyone that had never seen themselves represented felt like they were on that stage with us.
01:07:35.843,01:07:41.098,"As a Black woman, I used to feel like the world wanted me to stay in my little box."
01:07:41.807,01:07:44.769,And Black women often feel underestimated.
01:07:46.187,01:07:49.774,"I wanted us to be proud of not only the show, but..."
01:07:49.857,01:07:51.233,the process.
01:07:51.358,01:07:52.818,Proud of the struggle.
01:07:53.360,01:07:58.699,Thankful for the beauty that comes with a painful history and rejoice in the pain.
01:07:58.783,01:08:03.037,Rejoice in the imperfections and the wrongs that are so damn right.
01:08:03.579,01:08:11.670,"And I wanted everyone to feel grateful for their curves, their sass, their honesty, thankful for their freedom."
01:08:12.797,01:08:21.847,"It was no rules, and we were able to create a free, safe space where none of us were marginalized."
01:20:29.282,01:20:30.742,"Are y'all ready, Coachella?"
01:20:31.952,01:20:34.371,I wanna see everybody from the front to the back.
01:20:34.996,01:20:36.248,Put your hand up.
01:20:36.706,01:20:38.625,"Sing it now, hey! Hey! Hey!"
01:20:39.960,01:20:41.211,Jump!
01:20:42.379,01:20:43.421,Jump!
01:20:44.005,01:20:44.965,Yeah!
01:20:45.882,01:20:47.008,Let me see you jump.
01:20:53.431,01:20:54.391,Here we go!
01:23:11.861,01:23:12.821,I gotta go home.
01:23:48.064,01:23:50.900,"Just for shits and giggles, could you do this one, too?"
01:24:00.744,01:24:04.247,I respect things that are built from the ground up.
01:24:04.873,01:24:09.169,"You know, I'm super specific about every detail."
01:24:09.836,01:24:20.346,"I personally selected each dancer, every light, the material on the steps, the height of the pyramid, the shape of the pyramid, every patch was hand sewn."
01:24:20.930,01:24:24.017,Every tiny detail had an intention.
01:24:24.225,01:24:28.104,There were so many meetings with Olivier...
01:24:29.064,01:24:35.653,"before he flew to Los Angeles so we could understand, Okay, why do we want these colors?"
01:24:35.737,01:24:37.155,What do they represent?
01:24:37.655,01:24:38.907,What is the silhouette?
01:24:39.282,01:24:41.326,What is gonna look the most graphic?
01:24:41.826,01:24:43.119,How do we look united?
01:24:43.203,01:24:47.332,But how do we have these different characters that stand out?
01:24:49.292,01:24:51.961,It took months for us to script the show.
01:24:52.504,01:25:09.104,"When you spend so many months on choreography and arrangements, and when there are over 200 people on the stage, you want to make sure you see everything, and I was very adamant that we were well rehearsed and we knew the show front to back."
01:25:09.395,01:25:15.693,"It was a lot of Steadicam, and we did things that were very unconventional for a festival show."
01:25:23.701,01:25:25.537,I had three soundstages.
01:25:25.870,01:25:35.088,"There was one soundstage for the band, there was one soundstage for dancing, and there was one soundstage for my creative staff."
01:25:35.964,01:25:38.883,And I would go from one to the next.
01:25:39.676,01:25:42.011,"It takes a huge team, it takes..."
01:25:43.263,01:25:47.475,"a village, and I think we all worked to our limit."
01:25:49.435,01:25:51.563,"In the rehearsals, I am..."
01:25:51.855,01:25:54.315,directing and watching the show.
01:25:54.399,01:26:00.029,I'm in the audience and I'm able to be on the stage and kind of see the stage at the same time.
01:26:03.241,01:26:10.582,"After every run-through there's a meeting with, you know, at least 50 people, all of the department heads."
01:26:14.252,01:26:17.797,"he has to record the rumble of the structure, the stomps."
01:26:17.881,01:26:21.134,"He has to record everybody's, Hey! Ah!"
01:26:21.217,01:26:29.976,"And that adds another element of the performance that feels so good on the stage, and it's not translating on film."
01:26:30.185,01:26:35.190,"Until I see some of my notes applied, it doesn't make sense for me to make more."
01:26:37.817,01:26:39.319,how many times we've done it.
01:26:39.402,01:26:44.782,"There are notes every time, because there's always something that we can improve upon."
01:26:48.077,01:26:56.628,"and feeling it-- It is the only way I can articulate why I'm frustrated, because it's not translating on camera."
01:26:57.003,01:26:58.963,So my goal is simply that.
01:26:59.047,01:27:02.508,"Like, it's just so everyone out there can feel what we feel."
01:27:06.888,01:27:07.931,down for the cause.
01:27:11.142,01:27:16.522,to try to facilitate everybody's needs so we can be done with having to talk so much.
01:27:20.026,01:27:21.110,That's where I am.
01:27:21.486,01:27:23.863,It's-- We're halfway there.
01:27:24.656,01:27:27.992,"We just gotta make progress faster, because we're running out of time."
01:27:29.285,01:27:30.578,"Thank you, everybody."
01:27:30.662,01:27:31.579,Thank y'all.
01:27:31.663,01:27:33.957,"I know everybody's working hard, so we'll get there."
01:27:38.086,01:27:40.255,It's my anniversary.
01:27:44.259,01:27:45.468,"Okay, guys."
01:28:53.161,01:28:54.287,Here we go!
01:30:03.648,01:30:05.650,The people!
01:30:20.957,01:30:21.999,I'm talking to you.
01:30:37.223,01:30:39.016,I see y'all in the front row.
01:30:39.642,01:30:40.643,Hey!
01:31:34.572,01:31:35.448,All right.
01:31:38.910,01:31:39.994,"Sing it, y'all!"
01:32:02.099,01:32:03.184,"Sing it, y'all."
01:32:10.650,01:32:11.609,I see you.
01:33:02.660,01:33:03.995,Can I take this back?
01:33:05.746,01:33:06.872,"Sing it, y'all."
01:33:43.868,01:33:44.702,Hey!
01:33:45.661,01:33:46.912,I wanna see y'all do the dance.
01:33:48.414,01:33:49.415,You ready?
01:33:49.832,01:33:50.708,I'm watching.
01:33:51.125,01:33:52.335,Let's see if you know it.
01:35:41.402,01:35:44.113,make some noise!
01:38:16.932,01:38:17.808,Hey.
01:38:32.364,01:38:33.282,Here we go!
01:39:20.913,01:39:22.748,Anybody go to a HBCU?
01:39:24.708,01:39:26.251,Don't you remember--?
01:39:37.596,01:39:38.430,"Okay, okay."
01:39:38.514,01:39:40.641,"If you dropped out of high school, make some noise!"
01:40:00.995,01:40:03.080,"Be a force for good, Coltrane said."
01:40:03.163,01:40:06.041,"Mississippi Goddam, says Nina Simone."
01:40:06.125,01:40:07.793,That ain't having hope.
01:40:09.044,01:40:10.087,That's being a hope.
01:40:10.921,01:40:21.849,"Courageously bearing witness, regardless of what the circumstances is because you're choosing to be a kind of person of integrity to the best of your ability before the worms get your body."
01:40:21.932,01:40:22.766,Boom.
01:40:34.737,01:40:37.614,"like we're being spoken to, like it's worth it."
01:40:39.241,01:40:41.785,"We all performed with all of our heart, and..."
01:40:41.869,01:40:44.663,"we performed with love and connection, and..."
01:40:45.164,01:40:46.331,we did it together.
01:40:46.999,01:40:49.501,I love all of the people that were involved.
01:41:06.101,01:41:07.311,the Super Bowl.
01:41:07.394,01:41:09.063,It is the Coachella.
01:41:09.146,01:41:12.775,You got all your people coming back that you haven't seen for however long.
01:41:12.858,01:41:19.740,"You got all this tradition, you got all these eyeballs wanting to see if it's gonna be better than the last homecoming."
01:41:19.823,01:41:21.533,All those elements are right here.
01:41:29.625,01:41:32.878,"Message in particular is just a very powerful, very strong message."
01:41:32.961,01:41:34.671,Very inclusive.
01:41:34.755,01:41:37.299,But it really makes you proud to be African-American.
01:41:43.388,01:41:47.059,"He started dying, 'cause there's so many great sisters in there."
01:41:48.185,01:41:53.649,"Great freestylers, of course, and, you know, we a family. It feels like a college trip."
01:42:01.240,01:42:04.535,"She's the best, and I only deal with number ones. Ya heard?"
01:42:12.251,01:42:22.261,"something that will make people feel open and like they're watching magic, like they're living in a time that's super special, and..."
01:42:22.553,01:42:25.139,like it's a day that they will never relive.
01:42:25.222,01:42:26.515,That's what I want.
01:42:36.692,01:42:39.111,I don't even wanna go home after it's over with.
01:42:47.828,01:42:49.955,the biggest priority in my life.
01:42:56.628,01:43:01.884,"My family is my sanctuary, my weakness and my strength."
01:43:01.967,01:43:07.472,"They're my tribe, and it was important that we all felt like family."
01:43:20.110,01:43:26.325,It just was a dream come true and something I feel like I've worked my entire life for.
01:43:26.408,01:43:29.286,And I'm so grateful that I was able to come home.
01:43:35.167,01:43:49.014,"It's time for you to get a little taste of the only drum line certified by the Queen Bey, guaranteed to show up and show out, on your ass, anytime, anyplace, anywhere."
01:43:49.097,01:43:53.602,Introducing The Bzzzz.
01:45:31.700,01:45:33.243,We ready!
01:47:03.417,01:47:07.712,"Coachella, thank you for allowing me to be the first Black woman to headline Coachella."
01:47:12.968,01:47:14.344,Ain't that 'bout a bitch?
01:47:16.930,01:47:21.518,This song is dedicated to all the incredible women that opened up the doors for me.
01:47:21.601,01:47:23.103,"Thank you so much, ladies."
01:47:24.896,01:47:27.065,Do we have any strong women out there tonight?
01:47:45.041,01:47:46.209,Here we go!
01:50:04.806,01:50:06.641,to make themselves smaller.
01:50:06.725,01:50:10.145,"We say to girls, You can have ambition, but not too much."
01:50:11.146,01:50:15.900,"You should aim to be successful, but not too successful, otherwise, you will threaten the man."
01:50:17.152,01:50:19.613,We raise girls to see each other as competitors.
01:50:19.696,01:50:23.158,"Not for jobs or for accomplishments, but for the attention of men."
01:50:25.827,01:50:32.751,"Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes."
01:51:51.246,01:51:53.540,"Everybody, give it up for the beautiful Kelly."
01:51:54.499,01:51:57.043,-And the beautiful Michelle. -We love you.
01:51:57.627,01:51:59.879,My girl B is killing it tonight!
01:51:59.963,01:52:01.423,I'm so happy y'all are here tonight.
01:52:03.550,01:52:05.176,Do y'all remember this song?
01:54:24.691,01:54:25.817,"Sing it, y'all!"
01:55:16.701,01:55:17.702,Let's go!
01:55:47.941,01:55:50.193,Please give it up for Destiny's Child!
01:56:01.162,01:56:03.581,Give it up one more time for my best friends!
01:56:04.290,01:56:05.333,That's my best friends.
01:56:08.544,01:56:10.505,"Everybody say, Hey, Mrs. Carter."
01:56:18.805,01:56:21.641,"All the way in the back say, Hey, Mrs. Carter."
01:56:25.436,01:56:26.270,Okay.
01:56:26.604,01:56:29.107,"To my right say, Hey, Mrs. Carter."
01:56:31.401,01:56:34.654,"To my left say, Hey, Mrs. Carter."
01:56:42.412,01:56:44.247,Everybody put your hands together.
01:56:45.498,01:56:46.374,Yeah.
01:56:47.291,01:56:49.335,"Now everybody say, Hey."
01:56:52.922,01:56:56.009,"Even louder. Hey, hey, hey."
01:56:57.969,01:57:00.722,"Say, I ain't worried, doin' me tonight. Sing."
01:57:17.739,01:57:18.990,Sing. Get me bodied.
01:58:37.443,01:58:42.281,"Yeah! Ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Solange!"
02:00:39.774,02:00:41.067,Give it up for my sister!
02:00:45.571,02:00:46.697,"All right, now."
02:00:47.114,02:00:48.699,Everybody put your hands together.
02:00:51.369,02:00:53.579,Do we have any single ladies in the house tonight?
02:02:07.236,02:02:09.655,I want y'all to get nice and stanky with me.
02:02:12.616,02:02:13.784,Where I'm from...
02:02:14.952,02:02:18.622,we do things nice and stanky.
02:02:19.957,02:02:21.417,We do things nice...
02:02:22.626,02:02:23.753,and funky.
02:02:25.588,02:02:28.299,Can y'all repeat after me? You ready?
02:02:28.799,02:02:30.926,"Say, Hey."
02:02:49.570,02:02:50.571,Now wait.
02:02:50.654,02:02:52.907,You still ain't stanking enough for me.
02:03:13.886,02:03:14.887,Sing.
