00:03:48.394,00:03:49.437,...especially for you.
00:03:50.438,00:03:54.442,"Especially for the French. If it isn't too late, my congratulations."
00:40:26.507,00:40:30.511,"I want to know, from what direction did your people hear these sounds?"
00:41:16.724,00:41:20.144,Where did these sounds come from?
00:02:24.269,00:02:25.728,Are we the first?
00:02:27.689,00:02:28.815,What is it?
00:02:28.898,00:02:30.942,Are we the first to arrive here?
00:03:12.317,00:03:14.444,Is the interpreter with you?
00:03:15.445,00:03:17.739,I'm not a professional interpreter.
00:03:17.822,00:03:20.909,My occupation is cartography.
00:03:20.992,00:03:22.535,I'm a mapmaker.
00:03:22.619,00:03:25.330,Can you translate French into English and English into French?
00:03:25.413,00:03:26.414,"Yes, yes."
00:03:26.497,00:03:29.250,I explained to the team leader in Villahermosa.
00:03:29.334,00:03:31.252,I'm just a little taken by surprise.
00:03:31.753,00:03:33.671,Etes-vous Monsieur Loglin?
00:03:33.963,00:03:35.048,"Laughlin, oui."
00:03:35.131,00:03:36.633,"Oh, Laughlin. Pardon."
00:03:54.734,00:03:55.860,Merci.
00:03:57.195,00:03:58.488,They're all there!
00:03:58.571,00:03:59.822,All of them!
00:04:11.542,00:04:14.754,MAN 1: Check for landing marks and taxi trails.
00:04:15.296,00:04:17.590,"Hey, these are Navy PBFs."
00:04:17.757,00:04:20.009,"MAN 2: No, no. They're General Motors."
00:04:20.426,00:04:23.096,MAN 3: No. That makes them PBMs.
00:04:32.146,00:04:33.690,No taxi trails.
00:04:38.486,00:04:42.240,Mr. Lacombe wants the numbers off the engine blocks.
00:04:45.702,00:04:48.663,M-447148.
00:04:48.746,00:04:52.709,W-445529.
00:04:53.418,00:04:56.796,"Number 445529, check."
00:04:57.130,00:05:01.759,Approximately 46 gallons in the right tank.
00:05:01.843,00:05:05.013,"447149, check. Hey, will you please tell me something?"
00:05:05.096,00:05:06.306,What the hell is happening here?
00:05:06.389,00:05:07.932,It's Flight number 19.
00:05:08.016,00:05:09.017,Nineteen what?
00:05:09.100,00:05:13.104,It's that training mission from the naval air station at Fort Lauderdale.
00:05:13.187,00:05:15.773,They were doing target runs on an old hulk.
00:05:16.190,00:05:18.735,Who flies crates like these anymore?
00:05:18.818,00:05:19.944,No one.
00:05:20.028,00:05:23.448,These planes were reported missing in 1945.
00:05:28.745,00:05:30.455,But it looks brand new.
00:05:34.709,00:05:38.963,Where's the pilot? I don't understand.
00:05:40.465,00:05:41.591,Where's the crew?
00:05:41.674,00:05:42.675,Hey!
00:05:46.554,00:05:48.681,How the hell did it get here?
00:06:22.340,00:06:23.633,He says this guy is local.
00:06:23.716,00:06:25.593,He was here last night. He saw it happen.
00:06:49.325,00:06:50.535,Sunburn?
00:07:06.926,00:07:09.428,He says the sun came out last night.
00:07:11.222,00:07:13.057,He says it sang to him.
00:07:39.292,00:07:42.962,"PILOT 1: TWA 471, contact at 134.4."
00:07:43.087,00:07:44.755,"CONTROLLER: 344, was it?"
00:07:50.011,00:07:52.430,"Harry, keep an eye on that point-out I gave you."
00:07:52.513,00:07:54.348,He's on 122.5.
00:07:54.432,00:07:56.184,I'll be right back.
00:07:57.810,00:08:01.439,"PILOT 2: Indianapolis Center, you have any traffic for Air East 31?"
00:08:03.107,00:08:04.734,"Air East 31, negative."
00:08:04.817,00:08:11.616,"The only traffic I have is a TWA L-1011 in your 6:00 position, range, 15 miles."
00:08:12.533,00:08:16.537,"And an Allegheny DC-9 in your 12:00 position, 50 miles."
00:08:16.621,00:08:18.831,"Uh, stand by one, I'll take a look at broadband, over."
00:08:19.874,00:08:23.419,"PILOT: Air East 31 has traffic 2:00, slightly above and descending."
00:08:24.170,00:08:25.630,"Air East 31, roger."
00:08:25.713,00:08:28.591,I have a primary target about that position now.
00:08:29.050,00:08:31.052,I have no known high altitude traffic.
00:08:31.135,00:08:32.637,"Stand by one, I'll check low. Over."
00:08:33.846,00:08:36.349,"Vic, will you check low altitude, and see if they know who it is?"
00:08:36.432,00:08:37.892,"Center, Air East 31."
00:08:37.975,00:08:40.228,The traffic's not lower than us.
00:08:40.311,00:08:43.397,"It's 1:00 now, still above me and descending."
00:08:44.357,00:08:46.901,"Air East 31, can you say aircraft type?"
00:08:47.818,00:08:49.570,"Uh, negative, Center."
00:08:49.654,00:08:51.364,No distinct outline.
00:08:52.657,00:08:55.826,"Uh, to tell you the truth, the target's rather brilliant."
00:08:55.910,00:09:02.083,"It has the brightest anti-collision lights I think I've ever seen, alternating white to red."
00:09:02.583,00:09:04.460,The colors are little striking.
00:09:04.544,00:09:07.255,"PILOT: Center, this is TWA 517."
00:09:08.005,00:09:11.300,Traffic now looks like extra-bright landing lights.
00:09:11.384,00:09:14.262,I thought Air East had its landing lights on.
00:09:16.013,00:09:16.973,It could be a satellite.
00:09:17.056,00:09:22.103,"Air East 31, I have a primary target now in your 10:00 position, five miles, over."
00:09:22.186,00:09:23.938,"Affirmative, 31. I've never seen anything like that."
00:09:24.855,00:09:26.399,The traffic is proceeding northeast bound.
00:09:26.482,00:09:27.817,No altitude readout.
00:09:28.568,00:09:31.112,"Roger, Center. Doesn't appear he's gonna be a problem now."
00:09:31.195,00:09:34.615,"He's going to descend about 1,500 feet below me."
00:09:34.824,00:09:36.325,Wait a second.
00:09:36.659,00:09:37.827,Stand by one.
00:09:38.411,00:09:40.079,"Okay, Center, Air East 31."
00:09:41.664,00:09:43.583,He's heading right for my windshield.
00:09:43.666,00:09:46.752,"We're turning right immediately, and leaving flight level 350 now."
00:09:46.836,00:09:49.130,"Air East 31, descend and maintain flight level 310."
00:09:49.213,00:09:51.257,"Break Allegheny 444, turn right 30 degrees..."
00:09:51.340,00:09:53.426,Get on the horn to the 45th recon wing.
00:09:53.509,00:09:55.803,See what the hell they could be testing up there.
00:09:56.012,00:09:57.221,This is Indianapolis Center.
00:09:57.305,00:10:00.224,Do you have any test operations in restricted area 2508?
00:10:00.308,00:10:01.642,"PILOT: Air East 31, roger."
00:10:02.184,00:10:06.397,The traffic here is quite luminous and is exhibiting some nonballistic motion. Over.
00:10:06.606,00:10:07.607,"Roger, Air East 31."
00:10:07.690,00:10:09.358,Continue descent at your discretion. Over.
00:10:09.442,00:10:10.443,"Okay, Center."
00:10:10.526,00:10:12.612,Descent at pilot's discretion is approved.
00:10:12.695,00:10:15.740,"The traffic is approaching head-on, ultra-bright and really moving."
00:10:18.075,00:10:19.702,"Now, that was really close!"
00:10:19.785,00:10:22.747,Air East 31 is out at 340...
00:10:22.830,00:10:25.124,Ask him if they want to report officially.
00:10:25.207,00:10:28.544,"TWA 517, do you want to report a UFO? Over."
00:10:33.466,00:10:36.886,"TWA 517, do you want to report a UFO? Over."
00:10:39.013,00:10:41.932,Negative. We don't want to report.
00:10:42.558,00:10:45.269,"Air East 31, do you wish to report a UFO? Over."
00:10:47.605,00:10:50.483,Negative. We don't want to report one of those either.
00:10:50.733,00:10:55.154,"Air East 31, do you wish to file a report of any kind? Over."
00:10:55.237,00:10:57.740,"I wouldn't know what kind of report to file, Center."
00:10:58.407,00:11:00.826,"Air East 31, me neither."
00:11:00.910,00:11:03.245,I'll try to track traffic to destination. Over.
00:12:05.891,00:12:08.436,"Okay. Now, let's look around for a square."
00:12:09.019,00:12:10.938,Is the door shaped like a square?
00:12:11.397,00:12:13.441,No. It's shaped like a rectangle.
00:12:13.649,00:12:16.485,It has two long sides and two short sides.
00:12:27.413,00:12:28.789,Look all around.
00:13:39.443,00:13:40.444,What?
00:13:50.246,00:13:51.413,Barry?
00:14:02.758,00:14:03.926,Honey?
00:14:19.692,00:14:20.860,Barry!
00:14:23.529,00:14:24.572,Barry!
00:14:26.448,00:14:27.616,Barry!
00:15:07.990,00:15:09.575,"All right, everybody to bed."
00:15:09.658,00:15:10.868,TOBY: No way! To bed.
00:15:10.951,00:15:12.745,TOBY: Dad said we could finish watching The Ten Commandments!
00:15:14.788,00:15:16.916,"Roy, that movie is four hours long."
00:15:17.791,00:15:19.710,I told them they'd watch only five minutes.
00:15:19.793,00:15:21.295,Hello.
00:15:21.378,00:15:22.671,"Hi, Earl."
00:15:23.672,00:15:24.965,What?
00:15:25.382,00:15:28.218,"Oh, I know. Roy can't drive at night without me."
00:15:29.595,00:15:31.597,"Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait, I can't, uh..."
00:15:31.680,00:15:33.015,"Hey, honey?"
00:15:33.474,00:15:35.017,Jiminy Cricket.
00:15:35.184,00:15:37.061,It's Earl on the phone.
00:15:40.105,00:15:41.607,Just a second.
00:15:42.232,00:15:43.484,Hello.
00:15:43.567,00:15:45.444,"Neary, listen to me now."
00:15:45.527,00:15:47.321,Get over to the Gilmore Substation.
00:15:47.404,00:15:49.698,We've lost the power up and down the line.
00:15:49.865,00:15:51.700,There is a drain on the primary voltage.
00:15:53.285,00:15:54.787,at the Kennedy Substation.
00:16:03.379,00:16:04.421,"MAN: Hey, lights."
00:16:06.382,00:16:07.800,"MAN: Hey, lights. Hey. MAN 2: Oh, God."
00:16:35.077,00:16:36.996,Coxford. Crystal Lake is dark.
00:16:37.621,00:16:38.747,MAN: The system's failing.
00:16:38.831,00:16:40.165,I understand the system's failing.
00:16:40.249,00:16:41.250,What do you want me to do about it?
00:16:41.333,00:16:43.377,Let it all fail. Let it all fail.
00:16:43.460,00:16:45.004,We'll pick up the pieces later after it's gone.
00:16:45.087,00:16:46.922,"Listen, let's do things my way, all right?"
00:16:47.006,00:16:49.008,I got reports of vandalism on the line.
00:16:49.091,00:16:51.176,I got 890-megawatt lines down all over.
00:16:51.260,00:16:52.720,MAN 2: Crystal Lake is dark.
00:16:52.803,00:16:54.346,Tolono is completely gone.
00:16:54.430,00:16:56.724,"It doesn't matter. It's down, it's down! All but finished."
00:17:00.352,00:17:02.646,What's the normal tension for that area?
00:17:02.730,00:17:06.942,"If there's no wind, normal tension for the sag is 15,000 pounds per wire."
00:17:07.317,00:17:09.820,I was a journeyman in that area few years back.
00:17:10.946,00:17:12.406,"Good, an expert."
00:17:14.950,00:17:16.201,How would you like the job?
00:17:16.869,00:17:19.163,You're kidding! Where's his seniority?
00:17:19.246,00:17:21.415,"Well, it's not up to me. Where is the supervisor?"
00:17:21.498,00:17:25.294,"Supervisor is stuck in an elevator, trying to run the show from one of them little bitty trouble phones."
00:17:25.377,00:17:27.671,"But I am in charge here right now, and you're going to Crystal Lake."
00:17:27.755,00:17:30.049,"I am? Now, I can help, but everybody is everywhere."
00:17:30.132,00:17:32.718,"Now, if you have any questions, you ask to get on the horn to me, direct."
00:17:32.801,00:17:34.094,MAN: Got a fresh impedance coming up.
00:17:34.803,00:17:36.847,"It's not an overload, it's a drain."
00:17:37.389,00:17:39.641,Lines M-Mary-10 through M-Mary-15.
00:17:39.725,00:17:41.435,And Municipal Lighting is asking to be cut free.
00:17:41.518,00:17:42.728,"Neary, you know where that is?"
00:17:42.895,00:17:44.813,Okay. Grab a splicing crew and high wire act.
00:17:44.897,00:17:47.274,"And, Neary, don't get creative out there, just productive."
00:17:47.357,00:17:50.235,"Remember, he's counting on you, and I'm depending on you."
00:17:51.487,00:17:53.614,we're going to candle power in 10 minutes.
00:18:04.500,00:18:06.168,Barry!

00:18:37.199,00:18:42.871,"Cough up a Tolono or an Interstate. Highway 90, a little familiar landmark of some sort..."
00:18:43.455,00:18:46.416,MAN ON RADIO: Cornbread Road south of 20... Cornbread?
00:18:46.750,00:18:48.585,Power must have been restored up there.
00:18:48.669,00:18:52.005,Working? A couple hundred neighbors in their PJs like it's Saturday night out here.
00:18:52.089,00:18:55.634,"MAN 2: Dispatch, this is 411, do you want me to disregard that Tolono call?"
00:18:59.680,00:19:01.765,"You're in the middle of the road, jackass!"
00:19:02.474,00:19:03.809,Can you tell me where Cornbread is?
00:19:04.059,00:19:05.060,Turkey!

00:23:15.143,00:23:17.020,DISPATCHER: What is your location?
00:23:17.104,00:23:20.857,MAN: Just off the Tolono Expressway heading east toward Harper Valley.
00:24:26.131,00:24:27.299,Barry.
00:24:29.217,00:24:30.218,No!
00:24:30.677,00:24:31.887,Watch it!
00:24:37.225,00:24:39.895,"ROY: Oh, my God! Lady! Lady!"
00:24:40.395,00:24:41.897,Are you okay?
00:24:41.980,00:24:43.315,I'm sorry. I didn't even see him.
00:24:43.398,00:24:44.900,He was just standing right in the middle of the road.
00:24:46.484,00:24:47.694,BARRY: Hello.
00:24:47.777,00:24:49.112,"Oh, my God. Hello."
00:24:49.487,00:24:50.488,BARRY: Here!
00:24:50.572,00:24:52.616,"What's the matter with you? BARRY: Come here, I said."
00:24:52.699,00:24:54.326,"Barry, come back here."
00:24:55.035,00:24:56.036,"Come on, now."
00:25:26.775,00:25:27.817,Ice cream!
00:25:39.871,00:25:44.668,"They can fly rings around the moon, but we're years ahead of them on the highway."
00:25:53.802,00:25:55.220,This is nuts!
00:25:56.638,00:25:57.639,No.
00:26:38.805,00:26:40.307,Wait a minute!
00:26:41.808,00:26:43.143,What are you guys doing?
00:26:43.226,00:26:45.353,"Hey, that's Ohio! That's a quarter!"
00:26:51.484,00:26:52.861,"Jesus, Prewitt, look at that."
00:26:52.944,00:26:55.447,"Look at those suckers, they're glued to the road."
00:27:19.512,00:27:21.806,"DISPATCHER ON RADIO: Time check, 3:45."
00:27:43.036,00:27:44.245,"Honey, wake up!"
00:27:45.455,00:27:46.873,"Honey, Ronnie, wake up!"
00:27:46.956,00:27:48.458,You are not gonna believe what I saw!
00:27:49.042,00:27:50.668,"Ronnie? No, don't! Not now."
00:27:50.752,00:27:51.711,"No, no, no, listen, Ronnie."
00:27:51.795,00:27:53.671,"Ronnie, I never would have believed it."
00:27:53.755,00:27:56.841,"There was this, uh... In the cab there was this whole..."
00:27:56.925,00:27:58.676,There was a red whoosh that...
00:28:00.637,00:28:03.348,"Roy, um, Ike called you."
00:28:04.140,00:28:07.977,"And, um, the government, they want you to call them right away."
00:28:08.061,00:28:09.062,They said they couldn't reach you.
00:28:09.145,00:28:10.688,I turned the radio off.
00:28:10.772,00:28:13.358,You shouldn't do that. The phone's been ringing off the hook.
00:28:13.441,00:28:15.193,It woke Silvia up two times already.
00:28:17.278,00:28:21.699,You know those pictures in the National Geographic about the Aurora Borealis? This is better than that.
00:28:21.783,00:28:23.034,This is really... Come on!
00:28:23.451,00:28:25.245,"Come on, Ronnie, get up. Come on."
00:28:25.328,00:28:26.538,"Oh, Roy, what's wrong?"
00:28:26.621,00:28:27.831,Nothing's wrong. I don't know if anything's wrong.
00:28:27.914,00:28:29.082,Get up. Get up. I'm not kidding.
00:28:29.165,00:28:30.583,"Come on, come on. ls it an accident?"
00:28:30.667,00:28:31.709,"No, it's not an accident."
00:28:31.793,00:28:33.211,"You wanted to get out of the house anyway, right?"
00:28:33.294,00:28:35.547,"Well, not at 4:00 in the morning!"
00:28:35.630,00:28:38.717,"Ronnie, I need you to see something with me."
00:28:39.342,00:28:41.094,It's really important.
00:28:41.177,00:28:44.013,Okay. All right. What about the kids?
00:28:44.097,00:28:45.598,"What? Oh, the kids! I'll get the kids."
00:28:46.015,00:28:48.309,"Silvia, come on, we're going on a little adventure."
00:28:48.601,00:28:51.312,"Toby! Brad! Come on, get up! Up, both, come on!"
00:28:51.396,00:28:52.897,It's better than Goofy Golf. Come on!
00:28:57.152,00:28:59.320,RONNIE: I'm going as fast as I can.
00:29:00.613,00:29:01.823,ROY: Come on.
00:29:03.616,00:29:04.659,"All right, all right."
00:29:04.743,00:29:06.494,"Oh, hi, Mrs. Harris!"
00:29:07.120,00:29:08.663,"Roy, there's Mrs. Harris."
00:29:08.747,00:29:12.333,There better be a very good reason for us doing this because it doesn't make any sense.
00:29:14.169,00:29:17.172,"All right, Roy, I really think you've proven your point."
00:29:18.256,00:29:19.340,Roy.
00:29:19.591,00:29:20.675,Roy!
00:29:21.217,00:29:23.678,"Roy, you're sunburned. Look at you."
00:29:25.889,00:29:27.640,Wow! Hey.
00:29:29.684,00:29:31.436,"Honey, what is that?"
00:29:36.566,00:29:38.610,"Roy, what did it look like?"
00:29:39.527,00:29:41.738,It was like an ice cream cone.
00:29:43.698,00:29:44.949,What flavor?
00:29:45.283,00:29:46.493,Orange.
00:29:47.410,00:29:48.912,It was orange. And it wasn't like an ice cream cone.
00:29:48.995,00:29:51.122,It was... It was more like a shell.
00:29:51.206,00:29:52.207,"You know, it was like this."
00:29:52.290,00:29:53.541,Like a taco?
00:29:54.542,00:29:55.502,Was it like a...
00:29:55.585,00:29:58.463,"Was it like one of those Sara Lee, um, moon-shaped cookies?"
00:29:58.546,00:30:00.882,"Those, those crescent cookies?"
00:30:10.517,00:30:13.394,Don't you think I'm taking this really well?
00:30:16.481,00:30:20.735,I remember when we used to come to places like this just to look at each other.
00:30:25.156,00:30:26.407,Snuggle.
00:31:25.633,00:31:27.719,Is this the bathroom? Shh!
00:31:30.179,00:31:31.180,Psst.
00:31:45.862,00:31:49.490,"Hey, this is not your toy to play with every time l turn around."
00:31:49.574,00:31:51.492,He looks like a 50-50 bar.
00:31:51.576,00:31:52.994,"RONNIE: All right, out of this house, all of you!"
00:31:53.077,00:31:54.412,Out of my house!
00:31:54.954,00:31:57.832,"I'm sorry, but you're not to play with this, ever!"
00:31:57.916,00:32:00.877,Get out while I clean up your mess.
00:32:00.960,00:32:02.170,Thank you very much.
00:32:21.439,00:32:24.275,"RONNIE: Roy, I found this overnight tanning stuff."
00:32:24.359,00:32:27.779,"And I want you to spray it on half your face, so that your face looks all even, one color."
00:32:27.862,00:32:28.821,It makes my face look yellow.
00:32:28.905,00:32:30.448,"What does this remind you of, Ronnie?"
00:32:31.866,00:32:35.662,All right. Then we'll just tell everybody that you fell asleep under the sun lamp on your right side.
00:32:35.745,00:32:36.955,What for?
00:32:39.123,00:32:41.626,"Dad, can I ask you a question?"
00:32:41.709,00:32:43.419,What? Are they for real?
00:32:43.503,00:32:45.046,That's what for.
00:32:45.129,00:32:46.631,"No, they are not for real."
00:32:46.714,00:32:49.258,"Now, I want you to go outside and have a hot dog, okay?"
00:32:49.342,00:32:51.010,"Ronnie, don't tell him that."
00:32:52.387,00:32:55.098,"Don't talk about this until you know what you're talking about, okay?"
00:32:55.181,00:32:59.268,"Ronnie, that's crazy. If I can't talk about it, then how am I gonna know what's going on?"
00:32:59.352,00:33:00.311,What?
00:33:00.395,00:33:02.313,"Mom, I believe in them."
00:33:02.397,00:33:03.856,"I believe in them, too."
00:33:03.940,00:33:05.817,"Oh, no, you don't."
00:33:05.900,00:33:07.819,Dad says we do.
00:33:07.902,00:33:09.362,"No, he does not."
00:33:10.446,00:33:11.489,"Do you, Roy?"
00:33:16.619,00:33:18.287,But nothing's going on.
00:33:18.371,00:33:19.664,It's just one of those things.
00:33:20.081,00:33:21.833,Which things? Which things?
00:33:22.792,00:33:24.002,I don't want to hear this anymore.
00:33:24.085,00:33:25.461,"Ronnie, this is very important."
00:33:25.545,00:33:27.130,I am not just gonna let it lay here.
00:33:27.213,00:33:28.923,I want to call somebody about this.
00:33:29.007,00:33:30.174,There's nothing...
00:33:30.258,00:33:33.845,"Ronnie, I saw something last night that I can't explain."
00:33:35.763,00:33:37.598,I saw something last night I can't explain.
00:33:40.184,00:33:41.978,"I'm going out there again tonight, you know."
00:33:44.772,00:33:46.107,"No, you're not."
00:33:46.858,00:33:48.109,"Yes, I am."
00:33:48.359,00:33:50.069,"No, you're not."
00:33:50.278,00:33:51.654,"Yes, I am."
00:33:54.032,00:33:55.450,"No, you're not."
00:33:55.908,00:33:57.035,TOBY: Do they live on the moon?
00:33:57.118,00:34:00.455,"BRAD: They got bases on the moon, so at night they can come through your window."
00:34:00.538,00:34:01.539,You!
00:34:01.622,00:34:03.624,"This isn't a moonburn, you know, God damn it!"
00:34:03.708,00:34:04.709,You live on the moon!
00:34:04.792,00:34:06.794,I saw it. You came through my window last night...
00:34:06.878,00:34:08.004,You hurt me!
00:34:08.087,00:34:09.714,You took all my covers.
00:34:11.132,00:34:13.301,He loves his work. Don't say that!
00:34:13.551,00:34:15.511,What did he do? He was with us all night.
00:34:16.304,00:34:18.014,"Ronnie, I won't have to go tonight."
00:34:18.097,00:34:22.393,RONNIE: He's not like that at all. Stop yelling at me!
00:34:23.644,00:34:25.730,"Well, can't you tell him about this?"
00:34:25.980,00:34:27.690,Hello?
00:34:27.774,00:34:32.361,"I can't believe it. Roy, you got fired."
00:34:33.988,00:34:35.990,They didn't even wanna talk to you.
00:34:38.534,00:34:40.745,"I mean, I don't understand this, Roy."
00:34:41.954,00:34:43.247,Roy?
00:34:47.085,00:34:48.878,What is happening here?
00:34:52.215,00:34:53.841,We were up all night.
00:34:56.135,00:34:57.804,"I'm not getting a job, you know."
00:34:59.180,00:35:01.307,I am not getting a job.
00:35:02.600,00:35:03.601,Forget it.
00:35:19.951,00:35:21.285,This is not right.
00:35:49.188,00:35:50.189,Ah.
00:35:51.899,00:35:52.900,Hello.
00:35:54.235,00:35:55.236,Hi.
00:35:55.736,00:35:57.071,"Oh, hi. How are you?"
00:35:57.155,00:35:58.156,"Hey, you came here too, huh?"
00:35:58.239,00:35:59.949,Yeah. I was... Jillian Guiler.
00:36:00.032,00:36:02.702,Roy Neary. I'm sorry about what happened with the kid.
00:36:02.785,00:36:04.871,Good night! What?
00:36:07.039,00:36:08.416,Look at you.
00:36:10.418,00:36:11.419,Oh.
00:36:12.211,00:36:13.963,You got the same burn.
00:36:14.881,00:36:17.383,"Oh, yeah. But it's better on you."
00:36:17.508,00:36:18.885,You got it all over at least.
00:36:18.968,00:36:20.219,I gotta tan the other side tonight.
00:36:21.971,00:36:23.514,How's the kid? I'm really sorry.
00:36:23.598,00:36:25.850,"Uh, I'll be right back."
00:36:25.933,00:36:27.393,"Raise up your head a little bit, and give me a smile."
00:36:27.476,00:36:28.519,"Come on, son."
00:36:28.603,00:36:32.773,"JILLIAN: Hey, uh, he's a little young for a record, don't you think? Hmm?"
00:36:52.168,00:36:53.336,Weird.
00:36:55.421,00:37:02.803,"I know this sounds crazy, but ever since yesterday on the road, I've been seeing this shape."
00:37:05.056,00:37:07.934,"In shaving cream, and pillows, and..."
00:37:20.404,00:37:21.948,"Damn it, I know this."
00:37:22.031,00:37:23.783,I know what this is.
00:37:30.164,00:37:31.999,This means something.
00:37:38.547,00:37:40.216,This is important.
00:37:41.175,00:37:42.718,MAN: Here they come!
00:37:44.095,00:37:45.888,Out of the northwest!
00:38:01.529,00:38:03.864,It's like Halloween for grownups.
00:38:05.866,00:38:07.410,Trick or treat?
00:38:38.357,00:38:39.734,Wait a minute.
00:40:36.517,00:40:37.852,Where are the sounds coming from?
00:41:04.879,00:41:06.422,Where did these sounds come from?
00:41:06.505,00:41:07.506,"Tell us, please."
00:41:35.075,00:41:37.203,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen."
00:41:37.578,00:41:39.163,Parlez-vous francais?
00:41:40.831,00:41:45.252,"Well, I beg your pardon but my English is not good, too."
00:41:48.631,00:41:53.677,I want to share with you now the breakthrough that happened in India.
00:41:54.220,00:41:56.555,We think it means something.
00:41:58.307,00:42:00.434,We think it is important.
00:42:01.936,00:42:06.273,"To help you learn, I am using the hand sign created by Zoltan Kodaly."
00:42:08.025,00:42:12.321,Kodaly developed these signs to teach music to deaf children.
00:42:52.444,00:42:54.572,"And now, tous les sons ensemble."
00:42:54.655,00:42:55.698,S'il vous plait.
00:43:16.677,00:43:18.012,MAN: Here are the patterns.
00:43:18.095,00:43:20.598,We just received two 15-minute broadcasts.
00:43:20.681,00:43:23.267,Are these non-random signals? 104 rapid pulses.
00:43:23.350,00:43:25.728,"After a five-second interval, 40 pulses."
00:43:25.811,00:43:28.355,Another five-second break and 30 pulses.
00:43:28.439,00:43:31.984,60 seconds of silence and then a new set of numbers.
00:43:32.067,00:43:35.029,"40, break five, 36, break five, 10."
00:43:35.195,00:43:37.448,104 rapid pulses. MAN 2: Lord!
00:43:37.740,00:43:40.868,"Wait 60 seconds, and the whole doggone thing repeats."
00:43:41.869,00:43:44.997,Where are the signals coming from? Right in the neighborhood.
00:43:45.080,00:43:47.082,"Light travel time, roughly seven seconds."
00:43:47.166,00:43:49.501,It's within the plane of the ecliptic.
00:43:49.585,00:43:54.798,"Are these non-random signals here, 40, 36, 10, in response to that?"
00:43:54.882,00:43:55.924,No. But they should be.
00:43:56.008,00:44:00.262,"We've been sending out this musical combination for weeks, but all we're getting back are numbers."
00:44:05.809,00:44:09.813,This could mean the India sounds reached a dead end.
00:44:09.897,00:44:11.315,They don't mean a thing.
00:44:11.398,00:44:13.525,There's still so much that we don't know.
00:44:13.609,00:44:15.569,How about where the signals originate?
00:44:19.031,00:44:20.366,Excuse me.
00:44:22.409,00:44:23.994,MAN: What letter is 104?
00:44:27.414,00:44:28.624,Excuse me.
00:44:31.627,00:44:37.800,"Before I got paid to, uh, speak French, I, uh..."
00:44:37.883,00:44:39.259,I used to read maps.
00:44:41.595,00:44:43.931,This first number is a longitude.
00:44:47.935,00:44:50.813,"Uh, yeah. Two sets of three numbers."
00:44:51.271,00:44:54.149,"Degrees, minutes and seconds."
00:44:54.608,00:44:58.612,"And the first number has three digits, and the last two are below 60."
00:44:59.571,00:45:02.950,"Obviously, it's not in the right ascension and declination on the sky."
00:45:04.284,00:45:05.869,These have to be Earth coordinates.
00:45:05.953,00:45:08.789,"Surely, somebody has a map or a globe... There's a globe in the county supervisor's office."
00:45:12.126,00:45:13.669,That's what we need.
00:45:13.752,00:45:15.337,Maybe there's a release pin underneath here.
00:45:15.421,00:45:16.422,There's nothing under there. Must be on top.
00:45:16.505,00:45:18.257,"That's a $2,500 globe."
00:45:18.340,00:45:19.425,What are you guys doing?
00:45:19.508,00:45:21.260,"It's heavy, watch your feet. Let me hit the mother."
00:45:24.930,00:45:26.098,"No, no, the clearance room."
00:45:26.181,00:45:27.307,Okay. Come on. Come on.
00:45:37.151,00:45:38.735,"MAN: All right, everybody, calm down!"
00:45:38.819,00:45:40.529,Hold it down. Quiet!
00:45:45.534,00:45:47.828,"MAN: The antenna, how dumb. MAN 2: Huh?"
00:45:48.078,00:45:49.746,"MAN: Well, which way is the antenna pointing?"
00:45:49.830,00:45:51.707,"MAN 2: Northeast, probably. MAN: That's Wyoming."
00:45:51.790,00:45:52.791,MAN 3: All right.
00:45:58.630,00:46:01.258,We're going to need a geodetic survey map of Wyoming.
00:46:01.341,00:46:03.177,I want this down to the square yard.
00:46:03.719,00:46:06.305,Get me a geodetic survey map of Wyoming.
00:47:58.292,00:47:59.376,Toys.
00:48:01.295,00:48:02.379,Toys.
00:48:34.995,00:48:35.996,"JILLIAN: Come on, Barry."
00:49:20.415,00:49:21.625,"Oh, my God."
00:49:50.570,00:49:52.531,You can come and play now.
00:49:53.198,00:49:55.075,You can come and play now.
00:50:00.414,00:50:02.374,Come in through the door.
00:50:05.085,00:50:08.171,"One, two, three."
00:50:18.682,00:50:20.934,"Mom, look, the sun's here."
00:51:06.688,00:51:07.939,Go away!
00:51:11.526,00:51:12.652,Bang!
00:51:32.339,00:51:33.673,Clean everything up.
00:51:50.023,00:51:51.900,"Mom, let me listen. Wha... Wait a minute, honey. Wait."
00:52:09.751,00:52:11.378,"Mom, look. Oh, my God."
00:52:20.554,00:52:22.472,Come in through the door.
00:52:23.765,00:52:25.725,"Barry, no!"
00:52:44.202,00:52:45.328,Barry!
00:52:46.204,00:52:47.372,Barry!
00:52:58.717,00:52:59.801,Jillian. Jillian.
00:53:02.387,00:53:04.139,"Oh. May we have a statement, please?"
00:53:04.222,00:53:07.183,The report you gave to the police was really quite spectacular.
00:53:07.267,00:53:09.686,We need it for the 6:00 news.
00:53:09.769,00:53:11.980,Jillian. Mrs. Guiler.
00:53:12.147,00:53:14.441,They got him. What?
00:53:15.108,00:53:17.360,Is it true you're leaving the state to look for your son?
00:53:18.820,00:53:21.031,Where would you start looking?
00:53:22.949,00:53:24.910,The kid's name is Barry!
00:53:29.456,00:53:32.709,MAN: Are you involved in any kind of parapsychology?
00:53:34.419,00:53:38.340,"MAN 2: Turn around, please. MAN 1: We'd like to put you on the 6:00 news."
00:53:38.632,00:53:40.467,You gave the police a report.
00:53:40.675,00:53:43.303,Would you mind repeating it for the television?
00:53:46.056,00:53:48.642,"Folks, you can go in now. Room 3655."
00:53:49.601,00:53:52.896,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a flying saucer."
00:53:52.979,00:53:54.189,MAN: That's the one I saw!
00:54:01.821,00:54:07.077,"It's made of pewter, made in Japan, and thrown across the lawn by one of my children."
00:54:09.329,00:54:13.500,I just wanted to point that out to you to show that we're not all polished-brass about these things.
00:54:14.125,00:54:19.923,"And also to make a point, that last year, Americans shot more than seven billion photographs."
00:54:20.256,00:54:25.428,At a record of $6.6 billion for film equipment and processing.
00:54:25.512,00:54:30.308,"Now, with all those shutters clicking, where is the indisputable photographic evidence?"
00:54:30.392,00:54:31.810,Major Benchley.
00:54:31.893,00:54:40.777,"I've been in the news business for a long time, and our cameras have never been able to take a picture of a plane crash as it actually happened, or an automobile accident, and get it on the 6:00 news."
00:54:40.860,00:54:42.362,That's right. That's right.
00:54:42.445,00:54:44.072,I've seen the lights. I've seen the lights...
00:54:49.869,00:54:53.415,"Now, there are all kinds of ideas that would be fun to believe in."
00:54:53.540,00:55:01.339,"Mental telepathy, time travel, immortality, even Santa Claus."
00:55:02.132,00:55:06.428,"Now, I know it's no fun to go home and say, Guess what happened today?"
00:55:06.511,00:55:15.145,"I was in the shopping center, there was this tremendously bright light and I rushed outside and it was an airplane."
00:55:15.228,00:55:18.064,"Excuse me, sir. Uh, I didn't wanna see this."
00:55:19.441,00:55:20.984,I sure wish I had.
00:55:21.067,00:55:25.613,"You know, for 15 years, I've been looking for these damn silly lights in the night sky."
00:55:26.614,00:55:28.199,I've never found any.
00:55:28.283,00:55:31.244,"I'd like to, because I believe in life elsewhere."
00:55:31.619,00:55:36.750,Why don't you guys just admit that the Air Force is conducting secret tests in the foothills area?
00:55:37.083,00:55:43.548,"It would be easy to say yes to that, but I'm not going to mislead you. This is not the case."
00:55:44.841,00:55:46.968,"To tell you the truth, I don't know what you saw."
00:55:47.052,00:55:48.803,You can't fool us by agreeing with us.
00:55:51.222,00:55:53.475,I saw Bigfoot once.
00:55:58.104,00:55:59.397,1951.
00:56:00.774,00:56:02.525,Back in Sequoia National Park.
00:56:02.609,00:56:04.027,Had a foot on her.
00:56:04.319,00:56:06.237,37 inches heal to toe.
00:56:07.030,00:56:08.114,KIDS: Wow!
00:56:10.617,00:56:13.620,Made a sound I would not want to hear twice in my life.
00:56:18.958,00:56:22.087,I believe I've encountered that gentleman myself.
00:56:23.254,00:56:28.551,"MAN: I was sittin' on the porch one night lookin' through the screen, I seen this big white dot in the sky."
00:56:28.635,00:56:30.887,"And it turned red, blue and green."
00:56:30.970,00:56:35.475,"The further it got away, it just kept pulsating more and more and more."
00:56:35.558,00:56:39.938,BENCHLEY: UFOs do not represent a direct physical threat to our national security.
00:56:41.648,00:56:44.984,"We do not support them, and we encourage you not to."
00:57:24.023,00:57:29.821,"Let's get in touch with those forest service people, or we're gonna end up in a wilderness area with vehicular traffic."
00:57:30.530,00:57:34.284,And that's strictly sacred-cow stuff for those folks in Wyoming.
00:57:40.665,00:57:48.715,"If this mission fully develops, I get white knuckles just thinking about what might be ahead for those folks."
00:57:50.258,00:57:52.427,Your flight will be at 2000 hours.
00:57:52.510,00:57:55.388,We have a limo that will take you to the heliport now.
00:57:56.806,00:57:59.434,"And of course, the transportation will be provided on the other end."
00:58:02.896,00:58:04.314,I still like the flash-flood idea.
00:58:04.397,00:58:05.482,Where are you gonna get the water?
00:58:05.565,00:58:07.484,We've had about two inches of rain in the last... Wait a minute...
00:58:07.567,00:58:09.360,We can do a survey of dams and reservoirs in the area...
00:58:09.444,00:58:11.321,We don't have time... ...and tell them that one's gonna burst.
00:58:11.404,00:58:13.698,"And besides that, there's not enough water in those reservoirs..."
00:58:13.948,00:58:15.492,"MAN 1: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Contaminated water."
00:58:15.575,00:58:18.328,"Affects people, crops, disease."
00:58:18.745,00:58:20.413,"MAN 2: Yeah, an epidemic. A big epidemic."
00:58:20.497,00:58:21.706,MAN 3: What kind of disease?
00:58:21.789,00:58:22.832,MAN 2: Plague. A plague epidemic.
00:58:22.916,00:58:25.168,MAN 3: Nobody is gonna believe a plague in this day and age.
00:58:25.752,00:58:26.753,Anthrax.
00:58:26.836,00:58:27.921,Ranching country. Yes.
00:58:28.004,00:58:29.756,There are a lot of sheep up on those hills.
00:58:29.839,00:58:31.132,Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's good.
00:58:31.216,00:58:32.592,That's good. I like that.
00:58:33.092,00:58:35.178,But it may not evacuate everybody.
00:58:35.261,00:58:37.764,There's always some joker who thinks he's immune.
00:58:40.183,00:58:47.482,"What I need is something so scary, it will clear 300 square miles of every living Christian soul."
00:59:18.137,00:59:19.138,Toby!
00:59:19.222,00:59:22.100,"Did you get your bicycle... I'm gonna hit you across the street, tomorrow night."
00:59:22.183,00:59:24.602,Okay. Then I want you to ride your bike tomorrow.
00:59:24.686,00:59:26.145,Boys. No.
00:59:26.229,00:59:29.148,"Toby, did you finish your science project?"
00:59:46.165,00:59:47.625,I don't want to eat potatoes.
00:59:47.709,00:59:49.002,"Yeah, just a little bit."
00:59:51.212,00:59:52.213,That's good.
00:59:57.760,00:59:59.262,Help yourself.
01:00:01.514,01:00:04.017,SILVIA: I hate... I hate these potatoes.
01:00:04.267,01:00:07.061,There's a dead fly in my potatoes.
01:00:07.145,01:00:08.479,RONNIE: It's okay.
01:01:54.836,01:02:01.467,"Well, I guess you've noticed something a little strange with Dad."
01:02:05.388,01:02:06.889,"It's okay, though."
01:02:09.392,01:02:10.893,I'm still Dad.
01:02:16.065,01:02:19.652,I can't describe what I'm feeling.
01:02:20.570,01:02:22.238,What I'm thinking.
01:02:25.408,01:02:27.160,This means something.
01:02:28.870,01:02:30.413,It's important.
01:02:42.300,01:02:43.426,That's not right.
01:02:47.680,01:02:49.348,That's not right.
01:02:51.434,01:02:52.477,That's not right.
01:03:11.871,01:03:14.707,That's not right!
01:03:21.589,01:03:22.965,What is it?
01:03:34.560,01:03:36.062,It's not fair.
01:03:41.901,01:03:43.110,Tell me.
01:04:17.520,01:04:20.356,"DAFFY DUCK: Well, what do you know. It's disintegrated."
01:04:24.944,01:04:26.904,"you thing from another world, you."
01:04:26.988,01:04:29.031,"Oh, thank you."
01:04:36.622,01:04:38.791,"DAFFY DUCK: Well, I guess he's had enough."
01:04:41.043,01:04:43.129,Are you going to yell at me?
01:04:59.061,01:05:01.397,Ronnie? Everything's fine.
01:05:12.283,01:05:14.493,All this stuff is coming down.
01:05:19.290,01:05:21.500,All going to be like it was.
01:05:30.051,01:05:32.136,DAFFY DUCK: That's the last straw!
01:05:32.219,01:05:34.972,Now I use my secret weapon.
01:06:00.748,01:06:01.749,Ow!
01:06:04.251,01:06:05.336,Roy?
01:06:06.504,01:06:08.839,"Roy, I'm sorry about last night."
01:06:08.923,01:06:10.216,Roy!
01:06:11.634,01:06:12.969,Roy!
01:06:13.052,01:06:15.096,"Roy, what are you doing?"
01:06:16.514,01:06:17.974,"Oh, Jesus."
01:06:23.187,01:06:25.064,Roy. Roy.
01:06:27.274,01:06:28.776,The plants are fine there.
01:06:30.194,01:06:31.320,"Roy, can you hear me?"
01:06:31.988,01:06:32.989,Wait!
01:06:33.280,01:06:35.449,What are you... What are you doing?
01:06:35.533,01:06:37.785,"You're gonna love it, Ronnie! What do you mean?"
01:06:37.868,01:06:39.286,You'll really love this.
01:06:39.370,01:06:41.622,"Roy, what are you doing?"
01:06:42.707,01:06:44.583,SILVIA: Mom? My...
01:06:47.628,01:06:49.422,"Oh, Roy!"
01:06:50.673,01:06:52.049,"Oh, God!"
01:06:52.842,01:06:54.301,"Come on, men!"
01:06:56.137,01:06:59.473,"Dad, after this, can we throw dirt in my window?"
01:07:06.439,01:07:08.232,Stop. Stop it.
01:07:08.315,01:07:15.031,"Ronnie, if I don't do this, that's when I'm gonna need a doctor."
01:07:17.950,01:07:19.410,RONNIE: Roy! What are you doing?
01:07:19.493,01:07:21.454,I got it! What are you doing?
01:07:21.537,01:07:24.290,"I figured it out, that's all. Will you just listen?"
01:07:24.373,01:07:25.958,"No. Ronnie, look."
01:07:26.042,01:07:30.046,"You ever look at somethin' when it's crazy, and then you look at it in another way and it's not crazy?"
01:07:30.129,01:07:31.338,"No, I haven't. No."
01:07:31.422,01:07:33.340,"Come on, Ronnie! Just listen."
01:07:33.424,01:07:34.467,I don't know what you're doing.
01:07:34.550,01:07:35.801,If you just close your eyes for five minutes.
01:07:35.885,01:07:37.094,Just close your eyes and hold your breath.
01:07:37.178,01:07:39.263,No! Everything'll be pretty.
01:07:39.346,01:07:42.058,"Roy, you're scaring us now."
01:07:42.141,01:07:45.311,Don't be scared. Just don't be scared. I feel really good.
01:07:45.394,01:07:47.271,Everything's gonna be all right.
01:07:47.354,01:07:49.440,I haven't felt this good in years.
01:07:49.523,01:07:51.984,Everything's gonna be okay. I can feel it.
01:07:55.488,01:07:58.824,"Okay, now what else? What else? What else? Like this? Like this?"
01:07:59.575,01:08:00.743,Right.

01:24:20.555,01:24:27.312,"If the prevailing winds were blowing from the south instead of the north, this conversation would not be taking place."
01:24:27.395,01:24:28.688,There's nothing wrong with the air.
01:24:30.690,01:24:32.442,What makes you say that?
01:24:32.525,01:24:34.819,I just know. There's nothing wrong with it.
01:24:35.361,01:24:37.572,Go outside and make me a liar.
01:24:41.367,01:24:43.411,"Uh, look, I want to talk to the man in charge."
01:24:44.621,01:24:46.956,Mr. Lacombe is the highest authority.
01:24:47.040,01:24:48.625,He isn't even an American.
01:24:51.294,01:24:54.172,"Mr. Neary, are you an artist? Or a painter?"
01:24:55.507,01:24:56.674,No.
01:25:00.178,01:25:05.433,"Have you been hearing a persistent ringing in your ears, almost an agreeable ringing?"
01:25:05.517,01:25:06.601,No.

01:25:10.688,01:25:11.815,Yeah.
01:25:13.024,01:25:15.151,An irritation in your eyes and your sinuses?
01:25:15.235,01:25:16.402,Yeah.
01:25:17.570,01:25:20.365,Do you have hives? Do you have allergies?
01:25:22.700,01:25:25.036,And burning on your face and on your body?
01:25:25.120,01:25:27.413,Yes. Who are you people? Look at this.
01:25:28.039,01:25:29.666,"Yeah, I got one just like it in my living room."
01:25:29.749,01:25:31.292,Who are you people?
01:25:37.215,01:25:39.175,"Mr. Neary, please, one more question."
01:25:41.177,01:25:43.888,Have you recently had a close encounter?
01:25:45.140,01:25:48.143,A close encounter with something very unusual?
01:25:50.895,01:25:52.605,Who are you people?
01:25:59.779,01:26:02.031,LAUGHLIN: Are these people strangers to you?
01:26:02.115,01:26:03.992,"Yeah, except for her."
01:26:05.827,01:26:08.872,And the two of you felt compelled to be here?
01:26:09.873,01:26:11.207,"Yeah, you might say that."
01:26:12.250,01:26:13.835,But what did you expect to find?
01:26:13.918,01:26:15.253,An answer!
01:26:17.255,01:26:19.132,"That's not crazy, is it?"
01:26:38.193,01:26:39.569,Is that it?
01:26:40.612,01:26:42.614,Is that all you're gonna ask me?
01:26:43.948,01:26:46.618,"Well, I've got a couple of thousand God-damned questions, you know."
01:26:46.701,01:26:50.788,I want to speak to someone in charge! I want to lodge a complaint.
01:26:51.289,01:26:53.833,You have no right to make people crazy.
01:26:53.917,01:26:56.711,Do you think I investigate every Walter Cronkite story there is?
01:26:56.794,01:26:57.921,Huh?
01:26:58.630,01:27:02.175,"If this is just nerve gas, how come I know everything in such detail?"
01:27:02.258,01:27:04.344,I've never been here before.
01:27:05.094,01:27:07.222,How come I know so much?
01:27:07.305,01:27:09.390,What the hell is going on around here?
01:27:09.474,01:27:11.184,Who the hell are you people?
01:27:35.959,01:27:37.752,ROY: Is that it? Answer me!
01:27:39.212,01:27:42.006,I didn't come this far to get taken on any bus ride home!
01:28:05.280,01:28:07.115,Five minutes. Five.
01:28:07.824,01:28:10.576,We're gonna hold for a couple of minutes.
01:28:44.068,01:28:50.283,You brought in 12 people to the decontamination camp instead of the evacuation center where they belong.
01:28:50.908,01:28:52.368,I'd like to know why.
01:28:52.452,01:28:54.954,Because this means something. Because this means something.
01:28:56.998,01:29:04.756,These people have come from all over their country to a place they have been told will endanger their lives.
01:29:05.923,01:29:07.008,Why? Why?
01:29:07.091,01:29:14.515,Because somebody could be trying to subvert this whole operation by sending in fanatics and cultists and Christ knows what all.
01:29:14.599,01:29:16.225,Robert. Yes.
01:29:17.769,01:29:19.103,Thank you.
01:29:22.106,01:29:28.738,This is a small group of people who have shared a vision in common.
01:29:30.031,01:29:31.282,Look.
01:29:34.285,01:29:36.954,LACOMBE: It's still a mystery to me why they're here.
01:29:37.622,01:29:39.624,Even they do not know why.
01:29:58.309,01:29:59.560,Jillian!
01:30:01.104,01:30:03.397,Jillian! Don't! You'll be poisoned!
01:30:03.481,01:30:06.943,Listen. There's nothing's wrong with the air around here.
01:30:07.026,01:30:10.863,The Army's getting us out of here because they don't want witnesses.
01:30:11.572,01:30:15.076,"But if the Army doesn't want us here, then it's none of our business."
01:30:15.159,01:30:16.702,We only wanted to see the mountain.
01:30:16.786,01:30:18.788,It was such a coincidence when I painted it.
01:30:18.871,01:30:20.373,You can take it off! Take it off!
01:30:20.456,01:30:22.792,The air here is better than it is in Los Angeles!
01:30:22.875,01:30:24.585,"Right, right! Ah."
01:30:24.669,01:30:25.795,Listen. Listen. Yes.
01:30:25.878,01:30:28.005,How many of you people are for getting out of here?
01:30:35.012,01:30:36.347,And I must find out what's going on.
01:30:42.019,01:30:53.281,"I believe that for every one of these anxious, anguished people who have come here this evening, there must be hundreds of others also touched by the implanted vision who never made it this far."
01:30:55.158,01:30:57.076,Simply because they never watch the television.
01:30:59.537,01:31:02.915,"Or perhaps they watched it, but never made the psychic connection."
01:31:03.332,01:31:05.001,It's a coincidence.
01:31:05.084,01:31:06.878,It's not scientific.
01:31:09.547,01:31:11.507,"Listen to me, Major Walsh."
01:31:11.591,01:31:13.759,It is an event sociological.

01:32:42.807,01:32:45.434,And get me a photo analysis of the northern face.
01:32:45.518,01:32:47.812,"Yes, sir. It's already been ordered."
01:32:47.895,01:32:51.440,"Major Walsh, listen, I don't like to do this."
01:32:51.524,01:32:53.901,We're in enough trouble with these cattlemen already.
01:32:53.985,01:32:59.907,"But if you can't get these folks off the mountain and out of the area by 2000 hours, start dusting with E-Z-four."
01:33:00.950,01:33:02.451,What is E-Z-four?
01:33:02.535,01:33:05.913,It's a sleep aerosol. Same stuff that we used with the livestock.
01:33:06.038,01:33:07.498,Comes out of Riot Control.
01:33:07.581,01:33:10.459,"They'll sleep for six hours and wake up with hell of a headache, that's all."

01:33:13.587,01:33:15.423,We didn't choose these people!
01:33:15.506,01:33:17.341,They were invited!
01:33:24.015,01:33:25.850,They belong here more than we.
01:33:33.691,01:33:35.693,I should have never given up jogging.
01:33:35.776,01:33:37.778,You see that notch in the corner of the mountain?
01:33:37.862,01:33:38.988,We can make that one in no time.
01:33:39.071,01:33:40.072,Here come three more!

01:33:51.625,01:33:52.626,I remember from my painting.
01:33:52.710,01:33:54.837,It's an easier climb. It faces northeast.
01:33:54.920,01:33:55.921,It's no good. It's no good.
01:33:56.005,01:33:58.632,"When you get to the top, it's a 300-foot drop straight down."

01:34:00.009,01:34:02.720,What do you think is down on the other side?
01:34:02.970,01:34:08.476,There's a box canyon on the other side with ravines and trails if you take this gradual incline to the right.
01:34:08.559,01:34:10.061,I never imagined that.
01:34:10.144,01:34:11.729,In my painting I only painted one side.
01:34:11.812,01:34:13.481,There was no canyon in the doodles that I made.

01:34:14.899,01:34:16.233,They've given us a hell of a lot of credit.
