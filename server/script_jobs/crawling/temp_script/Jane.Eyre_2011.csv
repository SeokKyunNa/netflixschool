00:28:17.792,00:28:20.250,"Where did you live, Adele, before you came to Thornfield?"
00:28:20.959,00:28:25.792,With Mama but she has gone to the Holy Virgin now.
00:28:30.667,00:28:33.792,Mama taught me to dance and recite poems.
00:28:33.876,00:28:39.876,When gentlemen came to see her she would let me sit on their knees and sing.
00:28:39.959,00:28:41.501,"May I sing for you now, Mademoiselle?"
00:28:42.000,00:28:43.501,That would be lovely.
00:30:02.876,00:30:04.167,What is it?
00:30:21.959,00:30:24.125,"Why, what will it do?"
00:30:33.417,00:30:38.167,Sophie told me there is a woman who walks the halls of this house at nigh.
00:30:38.250,00:30:49.167,I have never seen her but people say she has hair black as ebony white skin like the moon and eyes like sapphires.
00:30:49.751,00:30:52.709,She can also walk through walls.
00:30:54.459,00:30:58.918,They say she comes to suck your blood.
00:35:46.876,00:35:49.459,"Monsieur, this is Mademoiselle."
00:42:01.501,00:42:03.667,"Oh my box, my box."
00:42:09.709,00:42:12.542,"Oh heavens, it is so beautiful."
00:42:38.334,00:42:42.334,"Monsieur, thank you a thousand times for your generosity."
00:54:16.083,00:54:18.042,"What is wrong, Mademoiselle?"
00:56:46.626,00:56:48.125,"Oh, she is so beautiful."
00:56:48.209,00:56:50.417,So elegant.
00:03:45.417,00:03:47.792,I will die.
00:03:47.834,00:03:49.500,I'll die.
00:04:17.333,00:04:19.250,St. John?
00:04:19.291,00:04:21.000,I found her at the door.
00:04:21.041,00:04:22.875,She's white as death.
00:04:25.000,00:04:27.166,"Hannah, some of that hot milk."
00:04:27.208,00:04:32.375,"St. John, we would have stumbled upon her corpse in the morning, and she would have haunted us for turning her away."
00:04:32.417,00:04:35.625,She's no vagrant.
00:04:35.667,00:04:37.792,There's milk for you.
00:04:39.375,00:04:40.875,Here.
00:04:43.000,00:04:44.917,Ask her her name.
00:04:46.041,00:04:48.709,Jane Eyre.
00:04:48.750,00:04:51.000,Tell us how we may help you.
00:04:51.041,00:04:52.458,Your name.
00:04:56.375,00:04:58.291,Where are you?
00:05:01.750,00:05:03.458,Must hide.
00:05:07.709,00:05:09.959,"St. John, we must get her warm."
00:05:10.000,00:05:12.125,Let us take her upstairs.
00:05:12.166,00:05:14.875,Will she die?
00:05:15.917,00:05:17.875,"Where are you, rat?"
00:05:29.542,00:05:31.500,I know you're here.
00:05:36.083,00:05:40.375,"If you crawl out and say Forgive me, Master Reed, I might consider it."
00:05:47.667,00:05:49.250,Mama.
00:05:49.291,00:05:50.959,John.
00:06:06.291,00:06:08.417,There you are.
00:06:09.750,00:06:11.458,"That book belongs to me, rat."
00:06:11.500,00:06:13.041,It belongs to my Uncle Reed.
00:06:27.375,00:06:31.250,"Spoilt, miserable brat!"
00:06:32.417,00:06:34.625,Mama!
00:06:36.333,00:06:38.000,Rat!
00:06:38.041,00:06:39.625,Mama!
00:06:39.667,00:06:43.583,- You wretched imp!
00:06:43.625,00:06:46.875,"- Hilary, take her. Take her!"
00:06:48.166,00:06:50.875,- Lock her in the red room.
00:06:53.542,00:06:55.792,"Please, please."
00:06:55.834,00:06:58.667,It's haunted. No!
00:06:58.709,00:07:00.583,Please! Please!
00:07:00.625,00:07:03.000,"If you don't sit still, you will be tied down."
00:07:03.041,00:07:04.750,What we do is for your own good.
00:07:04.792,00:07:09.208,"Pray for forgiveness, Miss Eyre, or something bad will come down that chimney and fetch you away."
00:07:15.542,00:07:18.625,"Let me out, please!"
00:08:03.041,00:08:07.375,"Jane Eyre, where the wicked go after death?"
00:08:08.542,00:08:10.333,They go to hell.
00:08:10.375,00:08:12.375,And what is hell?
00:08:14.375,00:08:17.083,A pit full of fire.
00:08:17.125,00:08:20.250,Should you like to fall into this pit and be burned there forever?
00:08:20.291,00:08:21.959,"No, sir."
00:08:22.875,00:08:25.166,How might you avoid it?
00:08:25.208,00:08:27.834,I must keep in good health and not die.
00:08:27.875,00:08:31.041,What is her parentage?
00:08:32.458,00:08:34.375,She's an orphan.
00:08:35.792,00:08:38.417,Her mother was my husband's sister.
00:08:38.458,00:08:41.417,"On his deathbed, he exhorted me to care for her."
00:08:43.208,00:08:45.333,I've always treated her as one of my own.
00:08:45.375,00:08:52.667,"If you accept her at Lowood School, Mr. Brocklehurst, keep a strict eye on her."
00:08:54.458,00:08:56.583,She has a heart of spite.
00:08:59.333,00:09:02.667,I'm sorry to say that her worst fault is that of deceit.
00:09:02.709,00:09:05.750,You can rest assured...
00:09:05.792,00:09:08.875,that we shall root out the wickedness...
00:09:08.917,00:09:11.458,"in this small, ungrateful plant."
00:09:11.500,00:09:17.291,"And as for its vacations, it must spend them all at Lowood."
00:09:31.083,00:09:33.125,You may leave.
00:09:37.208,00:09:40.542,You said I was a liar.
00:09:41.792,00:09:43.834,"If I were, I should say I loved you."
00:09:43.875,00:09:45.834,And I don't.
00:09:45.875,00:09:49.166,I dislike you worse than anybody in the world.
00:09:49.208,00:09:54.166,"People think you are good, but you're bad and hard-hearted."
00:09:54.208,00:09:56.166,I'll let everyone know what you have done.
00:09:56.208,00:09:58.875,Children must be corrected for their faults.
00:09:58.917,00:10:01.291,Deceit is not my fault.
00:10:01.333,00:10:03.291,But you are passionate.
00:10:03.333,00:10:07.041,My Uncle Reed is in heaven.
00:10:07.083,00:10:09.667,They know how you hate me and wish me dead.
00:10:09.709,00:10:12.875,"They see everything you do, and they will judge you, Mrs. Reed."
00:10:14.417,00:10:16.542,Get out.
00:11:11.083,00:11:13.500,Next. Show me your hands.
00:11:13.542,00:11:15.959,Stop there.
00:11:23.583,00:11:25.959,Very grand.
00:11:26.000,00:11:28.542,All right. Next.
00:11:36.375,00:11:38.750,Step out of your fine dress.
00:11:41.250,00:11:43.583,- Stay there.
00:11:45.041,00:11:47.041,Show me your hands.
00:11:56.458,00:11:59.667,My name is Jane Elliott.
00:11:59.709,00:12:02.291,Who can we send for to help you?
00:12:02.333,00:12:04.709,No one.
00:12:04.750,00:12:07.083,I mustn't ever be found.
00:12:18.083,00:12:21.625,Join me to thyself with an inseparable band of love.
00:12:21.667,00:12:26.041,For thou-- even thou alone-- dost satisfy him that loveth thee.
00:12:27.291,00:12:32.250,"And without thee, all things are vain..."
00:12:33.500,00:12:35.000,Amen.
00:12:35.041,00:12:36.208,Amen.
00:12:36.250,00:12:37.959,Amen.
00:12:47.208,00:12:49.709,"It's wonderful to see you up, Miss Elliott."
00:12:49.750,00:12:53.667,Last week we thought we'd be escorting your remains to an unmarked grave.
00:12:53.709,00:13:00.125,"She read The Bride of Lindorf, and suddenly it's all woebegone maidens and dramatic deaths."
00:13:00.166,00:13:02.125,I'm sorry to have caused so much trouble.
00:13:02.166,00:13:04.750,Nonsense.
00:13:04.792,00:13:06.709,since St. John's sermon on the fall of Babylon.
00:13:13.208,00:13:16.750,"I hope I'll not be eating long at your expense, Mr. Rivers."
00:13:16.792,00:13:18.917,Then tell me where to place you.
00:13:18.959,00:13:21.166,Show me where to seek work.
00:13:21.208,00:13:24.667,- You're not fit enough to work.
00:13:24.709,00:13:28.959,You return to your posts at the end of the month.
00:13:35.375,00:13:37.291,I'll endeavor to help you.
00:13:38.333,00:13:40.291,If that's what you wish.
00:13:40.333,00:13:42.709,"With all my heart, sir."
00:13:48.917,00:13:56.166,"This school you were at, Miss Elliott, this charitable institution, what did it prepare you for?"
00:13:57.291,00:14:00.625,Was it a thorough education?
00:14:02.500,00:14:04.417,Most thorough.
00:14:05.583,00:14:13.792,A little wit-- A little wit-- Will serve-- Will serve-- A fortunate man.
00:14:13.834,00:14:15.542,A fortunate man.
00:14:15.583,00:14:17.917,Again.
00:14:15.583,00:14:22.166,A little wit-- A little wit-- Will serve-- Will serve-- A fortunate man.
00:14:25.375,00:14:28.875,- A fortunate man.
00:14:28.917,00:14:30.792,Burns!
00:14:30.834,00:14:33.583,I will not have you before me in that attitude.
00:14:39.542,00:14:41.667,All rise.
00:14:43.417,00:14:47.208,I see you are mortifying this girl's flesh.
00:14:47.250,00:14:52.667,"Sir, she was not paying-- It is your mission to render her contrite and self-denying."
00:14:52.709,00:14:54.375,Continue.
00:15:08.375,00:15:10.125,The new girl.
00:15:15.208,00:15:17.417,This is the pedestal of infamy.
00:15:18.542,00:15:21.500,And you will remain upon it all day long.
00:15:21.542,00:15:29.125,"You will have neither food nor drink, for you must learn how barren is the life of a sinner."
00:15:29.166,00:15:32.291,"Children, I exhort you to shun her."
00:15:32.333,00:15:34.083,Exclude her.
00:15:34.125,00:15:36.542,Shut her out from this day forth.
00:15:37.834,00:15:46.208,"Withhold the hand of friendship, and deny your love to Jane Eyre, the liar."
00:16:22.333,00:16:24.542,How do you bear being struck?
00:16:25.959,00:16:28.041,Miss Scatcherd hits me to improve me.
00:16:28.083,00:16:30.333,She's tormented by my faults.
00:16:30.375,00:16:33.208,"If she hit me, I'd get that birch and break it under her nose."
00:16:33.250,00:16:35.250,She'd find another soon enough.
00:16:37.000,00:16:41.834,My father used to preach that life's too short to spend in nursing animosity.
00:16:45.875,00:16:49.583,"At my aunt's house, I was solitary and despised."
00:16:51.834,00:16:54.792,She thought I could do without one bit of love or kindness.
00:16:56.125,00:16:57.917,You are loved.
00:17:00.208,00:17:03.083,There's an invisible world all around you.
00:17:04.542,00:17:08.041,"A kingdom of spirits commissioned to guard you, Jane."
00:17:08.875,00:17:11.000,Do you not see them?
00:17:18.625,00:17:19.792,Jane?
00:17:22.250,00:17:24.208,Have you something for me to do?
00:17:24.250,00:17:26.208,You're doing something already.
00:17:27.291,00:17:28.875,May I see?
00:17:36.834,00:17:38.834,"Oh, these are wonderful."
00:17:43.041,00:17:45.875,St. John.
00:17:46.834,00:17:48.792,See how skilled Jane is.
00:17:54.542,00:17:56.500,"Is this how you perceive me, Miss Elliott?"
00:18:02.333,00:18:06.291,"Well, how fierce I am."
00:18:11.542,00:18:13.000,Jane.
00:18:14.083,00:18:17.959,You're freezing.
00:18:20.375,00:18:23.291,Come into bed and cover yourself.
00:18:33.375,00:18:35.834,How are you?
00:18:37.250,00:18:39.625,"I'm happy, Jane."
00:18:39.667,00:18:41.458,I'm going home.
00:18:43.208,00:18:45.500,Back to your father?
00:18:47.166,00:18:49.166,I'm going to God.
00:18:53.125,00:18:54.959,Don't be sad.
00:18:55.000,00:18:57.291,"You have a passion for living, Jane."
00:18:58.500,00:19:02.250,And one day you'll come to the region of bliss.
00:19:10.458,00:19:12.375,Don't leave me.
00:19:13.709,00:19:15.667,I like to have you near.
00:19:17.667,00:19:19.583,I will not leave you.
00:19:24.166,00:19:26.291,No one shall take me from you.
00:19:59.333,00:20:00.834,Helen.
00:20:03.417,00:20:04.875,Helen.
00:20:27.000,00:20:30.667,"Mr. Rivers, I wondered if you had yet heard of any work I could do."
00:20:33.083,00:20:35.750,"I found you a situation some time ago, but I've delayed telling you..."
00:20:35.792,00:20:39.041,"because the work is lowly, and I fear you'll scorn it."
00:20:39.083,00:20:41.041,I shan't mind what I do.
00:20:44.291,00:20:47.041,"When I took over the parish two years ago, it had no school."
00:20:48.250,00:20:50.166,I opened one for boys.
00:20:50.208,00:20:53.375,I now intend to open one for girls.
00:20:53.417,00:20:57.792,"The schoolmistress will have a cottage paid for by benefactors, and she'll receive £15 a year."
00:20:59.417,00:21:02.667,"You can see how humble, how ignoble it is."
00:21:02.709,00:21:04.667,"Mr. Rivers, thank you."
00:21:04.709,00:21:06.709,I accept.
00:21:06.750,00:21:09.542,With all my heart.
00:21:10.875,00:21:13.542,It is a village school.
00:21:14.875,00:21:17.792,What will you do with all your fine accomplishments?
00:21:17.834,00:21:20.083,I will save them till they're wanted.
00:21:20.125,00:21:22.041,They will keep.
00:21:54.208,00:21:55.917,Jane.
00:22:04.375,00:22:07.792,You will be quite alone here.
00:22:09.500,00:22:13.208,This is my first home where I'm neither dependent nor subordinate to anyone.
00:22:13.917,00:22:15.875,"Thank you, Mr. St. John."
00:22:19.375,00:22:23.000,"It is small and plain, as I told you."
00:22:23.875,00:22:25.834,Then it'll suit me very well.
00:22:41.458,00:22:43.792,"Safe journey, Miss Eyre."
00:22:44.875,00:22:46.458,"Good-bye, Miss Eyre."
00:22:46.500,00:22:48.000,Safe journey.
00:22:48.041,00:22:50.041,"Bye, Miss Eyre."
00:22:51.834,00:22:53.208,Girls!
00:23:02.625,00:23:04.291,Good-bye.
00:23:11.208,00:23:12.709,"Thornfield, miss."
00:23:50.375,00:23:52.375,"Wait here, miss."
00:24:18.041,00:24:19.834,"How do you do, my dear?"
00:24:19.875,00:24:22.959,- Are you Mrs. Fairfax?
00:24:26.542,00:24:29.000,What a tedious journey you must have had.
00:24:29.041,00:24:31.125,"Oh, your hands must be frozen."
00:24:31.166,00:24:33.083,Here.
00:24:37.375,00:24:39.375,"Goodness, how young you are."
00:24:39.417,00:24:41.792,"I'm quite experienced, I can assure you."
00:24:41.834,00:24:45.250,Of course you are.
00:24:45.291,00:24:49.709,"Leah, would you ask Martha to bring a little hot port and cut a sandwich or two?"
00:24:49.750,00:24:51.542,Draw nearer the fire.
00:24:51.583,00:24:53.709,John is taking your trunk up to your room.
00:24:58.125,00:25:00.834,I've put you at the back of the house.
00:25:00.875,00:25:06.709,"The rooms at the front have much finer furniture, but they're so gloomy and solitary, I think."
00:25:07.709,00:25:09.625,I'm glad you're come.
00:25:10.667,00:25:17.208,"To be sure, this is a grand old house, but I must confess that in winter one can feel a little dreary and alone."
00:25:17.250,00:25:20.500,"Leah's a very nice girl, and..."
00:25:20.542,00:25:23.834,"John and Martha are good people too, but..."
00:25:23.875,00:25:26.250,they are servants.
00:25:26.291,00:25:29.375,One cannot talk to them on terms of equality.
00:25:32.041,00:25:34.417,Am I meeting Miss Fairfax tonight?
00:25:34.458,00:25:36.166,Who?
00:25:36.208,00:25:38.500,"Miss Fairfax, my pupil."
00:25:38.542,00:25:42.667,"Oh, you mean Miss Varens, Mr. Rochester's ward."
00:25:42.709,00:25:45.291,Who's Mr. Rochester?
00:25:45.333,00:25:47.917,"Why, the owner of Thornfield."
00:25:47.959,00:25:50.709,Mr. Edward Fairfax Rochester.
00:25:50.750,00:25:52.875,I thought Thornfield Hall belonged to you.
00:25:52.917,00:25:56.792,"Oh, bless you, child."
00:25:56.834,00:25:59.667,I'm only the housekeeper.
00:25:59.709,00:26:02.917,There is a distant connection between Mr. Rochester and me.
00:26:02.959,00:26:05.875,"His mother was a Fairfax, but I'd never presume on it."
00:26:05.917,00:26:09.709,Heavens.
00:26:09.750,00:26:14.834,"We shall have a cheerful house this winter, with Miss Varens here and with you."
00:26:14.875,00:26:17.083,We'll have quite a merry time of it.
00:26:17.125,00:26:28.333,"I'm sure that last winter-- and what a severe one it was-- if it didn't rain, it snowed; and if it didn't snow, it blew-- I declare, not one soul came to the house from November to February."
00:26:28.375,00:26:32.417,"When spring finally came, I thought it a great relief I hadn't gone distracted."
00:26:36.166,00:26:38.166,I've had Martha lay a fire.
00:26:38.208,00:26:40.166,I hope you'll be comfortable.
00:27:20.458,00:27:23.083,Now get that lot turned over fore frost comes down.
00:27:32.625,00:27:35.875,We must open the window in the study today to let in some air.
00:27:35.917,00:27:39.208,"And when you've finished that, Leah, would you do the mantel and the mirror?"
00:27:39.250,00:27:42.208,I've never seen such an ancient old house.
00:27:42.250,00:27:44.333,How beautifully you've preserved it.
00:27:44.375,00:27:47.959,"Well, Mr. Rochester's visits are always unexpected."
00:27:48.000,00:27:53.250,"He doesn't like to arrive and find everything all swathed up, so I keep it in constant readiness."
00:27:53.291,00:27:56.458,"Now, come and meet Miss Varens."
00:27:59.709,00:28:01.583,Did I mention she's French?
00:28:01.625,00:28:05.208,Sophie has been crying because no one understands us.
00:28:06.458,00:28:10.959,Nobody can speak to us except for Mr. Rochester but he is away.
00:28:12.083,00:28:14.125,Will you ask her about her parents?
00:28:14.166,00:28:17.375,Mr. Rochester's neglected to tell me anything about her.
00:28:17.792,00:28:20.792,"Where did you live, Adele, before you came to Thornfield?"
00:28:21.041,00:28:25.333,With Mama but she has gone to the Holy Virgin now.
00:28:27.542,00:28:29.500,Her mother has passed away.
00:28:30.542,00:28:33.750,Mama taught me to dance and recite poems.
00:28:33.792,00:28:39.750,When gentlemen came to see her she would let me sit on their knees and sing.
00:28:39.792,00:28:42.000,"May I sing for you now, Mademoiselle?"
00:28:42.041,00:28:43.458,That would be lovely.
00:28:46.834,00:28:48.792,Adele is going to show us her accomplishments.
00:28:48.834,00:28:50.500,Oh.
00:29:32.834,00:29:34.750,How very French.
00:29:37.208,00:29:39.125,Very good.
00:29:41.208,00:29:43.166,Je ne sais pas.
00:29:43.208,00:29:46.291,Now we're gonna make a press.
00:29:48.000,00:29:49.917,Butterfly.
00:29:49.959,00:29:52.667,And what was it before it was a butterfly?
00:29:52.709,00:29:54.792,Caterpillar.
00:29:54.834,00:29:57.375,I shall leave and walk into town.
00:29:57.417,00:30:02.875,"Do not go, begged her maid, for Gytrash roams these hills."
00:30:03.041,00:30:04.041,What is it?
00:30:05.500,00:30:08.959,The spirit of the north that lies in wait for travelers.
00:30:09.000,00:30:15.375,"It tenants the carcasses of beasts, possesses horses, wolves, great dogs."
00:30:15.417,00:30:18.834,"You know it only by its eyes, which burn as red as coals."
00:30:18.875,00:30:24.291,"And if one should chance upon you-- Why, what will it do?"
00:30:24.333,00:30:26.250,Nothing.
00:30:26.291,00:30:27.875,A mere story.
00:30:33.500,00:30:38.083,Sophie told me there is a woman who walks the halls of this house at night.
00:30:38.125,00:30:50.208,I have never seen her but people say she has hair black as ebony white skin like the moon and eyes like sapphires.
00:30:50.250,00:30:54.417,She can also walk through walls.
00:30:54.458,00:31:01.125,They say she comes to suck your blood.
00:31:01.166,00:31:02.875,What nonsense.
00:31:18.792,00:31:21.208,Whatever brings you up here?
00:31:21.250,00:31:23.208,I've been waiting to pour our tea.
00:31:23.250,00:31:25.208,"I'm not in need of tea, thank you."
00:31:29.750,00:31:31.709,"It's a quiet life, isn't it?"
00:31:33.542,00:31:35.875,This isolated house.
00:31:37.375,00:31:39.667,A still doom for a young woman.
00:31:42.625,00:31:48.000,"I wish a woman could have action in her life, like a man."
00:31:48.041,00:31:52.125,It agitates me to pain that the skyline over there is ever our limit.
00:31:53.625,00:31:57.291,I long sometimes for a power of vision that would overpass it.
00:31:57.333,00:32:03.834,If I could behold all I imagine-- I've never seen a city.
00:32:03.875,00:32:07.750,Never spoken with men.
00:32:12.208,00:32:16.041,"Now, exercise and fresh air."
00:32:16.083,00:32:18.542,"Great cures for anything, they say."
00:32:18.583,00:32:20.625,I've some letters to post.
00:32:20.667,00:32:22.583,Will you take them?
00:33:20.417,00:33:24.250,"Up. Up you get, beast. Up."
00:33:25.542,00:33:28.166,Stand back.
00:33:28.208,00:33:30.834,"Are you injured, sir?"
00:33:30.875,00:33:33.291,Where did you come from?
00:33:33.333,00:33:37.083,"Just below, at Thornfield Hall."
00:33:39.417,00:33:42.875,I'm on my way to post a letter.
00:33:42.917,00:33:44.500,The governess.
00:33:45.959,00:33:47.917,You may help me yourself.
00:33:47.959,00:33:50.166,Get hold of his bridle and lead him to me.
00:33:53.583,00:33:56.000,If you would be so kind.
00:34:06.834,00:34:09.291,It would be easier to bring me to the horse.
00:34:13.166,00:34:16.834,"I must beg of you to please come here, Miss Governess."
00:34:31.542,00:34:33.208,Hold him.
00:34:40.125,00:34:42.125,Easy.
00:34:42.166,00:34:47.083,"Make haste with your letter, for who knows what might lurk in these dark woods."
00:34:48.709,00:34:51.000,Come. Come on.
00:34:51.041,00:34:52.583,Go.
00:35:04.834,00:35:07.959,"Leah, go up and light the fire in the master's bedroom."
00:35:08.000,00:35:11.125,"Oh, and tell Martha to prepare for tea."
00:35:12.792,00:35:15.041,Mr. Rochester's here.
00:35:15.083,00:35:17.417,Go and change your frock.
00:35:17.458,00:35:19.583,"Leah, take her cloak."
00:35:19.625,00:35:21.959,I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester's here.
00:35:22.000,00:35:23.750,But all my dresses are the same.
00:35:23.792,00:35:26.750,"Well, you must have one that's better."
00:35:26.792,00:35:28.875,He's in a terrible humor.
00:35:28.917,00:35:32.208,"His horse fell in Hay Lane, and his ankle is sprained."
00:35:32.250,00:35:35.375,He's at the doctor this half hour.
00:35:46.792,00:35:48.625,"Monsieur, this is Mademoiselle."
00:36:04.291,00:36:06.208,Let her sit.
00:36:21.709,00:36:24.875,"I've examined Adele, and I find you've taken great pains with her."
00:36:24.917,00:36:27.875,"She's not bright, she has no talents."
00:36:27.917,00:36:29.917,Yet in a short time she's improved.
00:36:30.875,00:36:32.834,"Thank you, Mr. Rochester."
00:36:32.875,00:36:35.750,You've been resident here three months?
00:36:35.792,00:36:38.041,And from whence do you hail?
00:36:38.750,00:36:40.709,What's your tale of woe?
00:36:42.125,00:36:43.417,Pardon?
00:36:43.458,00:36:47.166,All governesses have a tale of woe.
00:36:47.208,00:36:53.208,"I was brought up by my aunt, Mrs. Reed of Gateshead, in a house even finer than this."
00:36:53.250,00:36:57.333,"I then attended Lowood School, where I received as good an education as I could hope for."
00:36:57.375,00:36:59.792,"And I have no tale of woe, sir."
00:36:59.834,00:37:02.333,Where are your parents?
00:37:02.375,00:37:04.291,Do you remember them?
00:37:06.333,00:37:08.750,And why are you not with Mrs. Reed of Gateshead now?
00:37:11.125,00:37:13.583,"She cast me off, sir."
00:37:13.625,00:37:15.000,Why?
00:37:15.041,00:37:17.583,"'Cause I was burdensome, and she disliked me."
00:37:19.333,00:37:21.250,No tale of woe?
00:37:25.375,00:37:28.709,I daily thank providence for sending us Miss Eyre.
00:37:28.750,00:37:32.125,She's an invaluable-- Don't trouble yourself to give her a character.
00:37:32.166,00:37:34.083,I'll judge for myself.
00:37:35.083,00:37:37.166,I have her to thank for this sprain.
00:37:37.208,00:37:38.542,Sir?
00:37:39.625,00:37:41.375,You bewitched my horse.
00:37:41.417,00:37:43.166,I did not.
00:37:43.208,00:37:45.583,Were you waiting for your people on that lane?
00:37:45.625,00:37:47.625,"I have no people, sir."
00:37:47.667,00:37:51.959,I mean for the imps and elves and little green men.
00:37:52.000,00:37:55.208,The sad truth is they are all gone.
00:37:55.250,00:37:58.375,Your land is neither wild nor savage enough for them.
00:38:05.333,00:38:07.291,Adele brought me these.
00:38:07.333,00:38:08.917,"Yes, sir."
00:38:08.959,00:38:12.166,Where did you get your copies?
00:38:13.208,00:38:15.542,That head I now see on your shoulders?
00:38:15.583,00:38:16.959,"Yes, sir."
00:38:20.417,00:38:22.166,Who's this?
00:38:23.834,00:38:25.792,The Evening Star.
00:38:27.500,00:38:30.500,Were you happy when you painted these?
00:38:30.542,00:38:33.792,To paint is one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known.
00:38:33.834,00:38:36.625,Then your pleasures have been few.
00:38:36.667,00:38:38.458,Are you satisfied with them?
00:38:39.291,00:38:41.000,Far from it.
00:38:41.041,00:38:43.542,I imagine things I'm powerless to execute.
00:38:43.583,00:38:45.542,You've secured the shadow of your thoughts.
00:38:46.875,00:38:50.125,"Yet the drawings are, for a schoolgirl, peculiar."
00:39:03.750,00:39:05.542,Good night.
00:39:08.333,00:39:09.875,"Come, Adele."
00:39:17.458,00:39:22.417,"Most merciful Father, we give thee humble thanks for this, thy special bounty."
00:39:23.083,00:39:24.667,Amen.
00:39:24.709,00:39:26.583,Amen.
00:39:42.000,00:39:44.000,"Sit nicely, please, Adele."
00:39:45.375,00:39:47.333,Pilot!
00:39:53.375,00:39:55.709,"Pilot, come here!"
00:40:03.125,00:40:05.667,Go on! Further down!
00:40:07.542,00:40:09.291,By the river!
00:40:09.333,00:40:11.250,He's very abrupt and changeful.
00:40:14.208,00:40:17.417,What manner of man is he?
00:40:18.375,00:40:25.458,"He's fine company too, when he's-- Except when he's in an ill humor."
00:40:26.083,00:40:27.500,Adele.
00:40:55.917,00:40:57.917,D'accord.
00:41:08.625,00:41:10.917,Right.
00:41:10.959,00:41:12.959,"One, two, three."
00:41:13.000,00:41:15.166,Ready?
00:41:17.291,00:41:20.291,Aw.
00:41:20.333,00:41:23.417,"Think that's it, sir."
00:41:28.166,00:41:29.667,Come on.
00:41:45.375,00:41:47.083,Keep it.
00:42:00.125,00:42:03.000,"Oh my box, my box."
00:42:05.625,00:42:07.583,Take it away and disembowel it.
00:42:09.875,00:42:12.834,"Oh heavens, it is so beautiful."
00:42:12.875,00:42:14.250,Beautiful.
00:42:14.291,00:42:15.875,Miss Eyre.
00:42:23.375,00:42:25.333,I'm not fond of children.
00:42:25.375,00:42:29.208,Nor do I particularly enjoy simple-minded old ladies.
00:42:29.250,00:42:32.500,"But you might suit me, if you would."
00:42:32.542,00:42:34.000,"How, sir?"
00:42:34.041,00:42:37.500,By distracting me from the mire of my thoughts.
00:42:38.417,00:42:42.959,"Monsieur, thank you a thousand times for your generosity."
00:42:43.000,00:42:45.500,That is how Maman used to say.
00:42:45.542,00:42:47.667,Precisely.
00:42:47.709,00:42:51.542,And that's how she charmed my English gold out of my English pocket.
00:42:53.125,00:42:55.125,"Let's go and try it on, shall we?"
00:43:07.542,00:43:09.917,"Your gaze is very direct, Miss Eyre."
00:43:11.041,00:43:12.792,Do you think me handsome?
00:43:13.959,00:43:15.458,"No, sir."
00:43:16.333,00:43:18.083,What fault do you find with me?
00:43:18.125,00:43:19.917,I have all my limbs and features.
00:43:20.875,00:43:23.000,"I beg your pardon, sir."
00:43:23.041,00:43:25.875,I ought to have replied that beauty is of little consequence.
00:43:32.375,00:43:34.208,"You're blushing, Miss Eyre."
00:43:36.041,00:43:40.959,"And though you're not pretty any more than I am handsome, I must say it becomes you."
00:43:46.166,00:43:49.041,And now I see you're fascinated by the flowers on the rug.
00:43:52.250,00:43:54.583,"Come, speak to me."
00:43:54.625,00:43:57.417,"Fact is, Miss Eyre, I'd like to draw you out."
00:43:57.458,00:44:00.583,You've rather the look of another world about you.
00:44:04.709,00:44:06.667,I don't wish to treat you as inferior.
00:44:08.417,00:44:10.959,Yet you'd command me to speak?
00:44:11.000,00:44:13.166,Are you very hurt by my tone of command?
00:44:13.208,00:44:15.208,There are few masters who'd trouble to inquire...
00:44:15.250,00:44:18.250,whether their paid subordinates were hurt by their commands.
00:44:18.291,00:44:20.000,Paid subordinate?
00:44:20.041,00:44:22.625,I'd forgotten the salary.
00:44:22.667,00:44:26.917,"Well, on that mercenary ground, will you consent to speak as my equal..."
00:44:26.959,00:44:29.333,without thinking that the request arises from insolence?
00:44:29.375,00:44:32.834,"I'd never mistake informality for insolence, sir."
00:44:32.875,00:44:34.417,"One, I rather like."
00:44:34.458,00:44:37.333,"The other, nothing freeborn should ever submit to."
00:44:37.375,00:44:38.834,Humbug.
00:44:38.875,00:44:40.834,Even for a salary.
00:44:40.875,00:44:44.125,Most freeborn things would submit to anything for a salary.
00:44:47.000,00:44:49.208,But I mentally shake hands with you for your answer.
00:44:51.166,00:44:54.667,"Not three in 3,000 schoolgirl governesses would have answered me as you've just done."
00:44:54.709,00:44:58.375,"Then you've not spent much time in our company, sir."
00:44:58.417,00:45:04.583,"I'm the same plain kind of bird as all the rest, with my common tale of woe."
00:45:07.375,00:45:09.166,I envy you.
00:45:11.000,00:45:12.542,How?
00:45:12.583,00:45:14.834,"Your openness, your unpolluted mind."
00:45:16.667,00:45:20.041,"When I was your age, fate dealt me a blow."
00:45:21.750,00:45:26.291,"And since happiness is denied me, I've a right to get pleasure in its stead."
00:45:26.333,00:45:29.208,"And I will get it, cost what it may."
00:45:29.250,00:45:32.208,Then you'll degenerate still more.
00:45:33.041,00:45:50.709,"But, Miss Eyre, if the pleasure I was seeking was sweet and fresh; if it was an inspiration; if it wore the robes of an angel of light, what then?"
00:45:54.542,00:45:57.417,"To speak truth, sir, I don't understand you at all."
00:45:59.583,00:46:01.875,I fear the conversation has got out of my depth.
00:46:03.250,00:46:05.083,You're afraid of me.
00:46:05.125,00:46:07.333,I'm not afraid.
00:46:07.375,00:46:09.875,I've simply no wish to talk nonsense.
00:46:18.458,00:46:20.208,"Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre?"
00:46:22.709,00:46:25.667,Only rarely perhaps.
00:46:25.709,00:46:29.333,But you're not naturally austere any more than I'm naturally vicious.
00:46:30.792,00:46:34.083,I can see in you the glance of a curious sort of bird...
00:46:34.125,00:46:38.959,"through the close-set bars of a cage-- a vivid, restless captive."
00:46:41.959,00:46:47.250,"Were it but free, it would soar, cloud high."
00:47:14.792,00:47:17.208,"Leah, have you seen Mrs. Poole?"
00:47:17.250,00:47:19.583,The master's in no mood for any more mistakes.
00:47:50.208,00:47:52.041,Who's there?
00:48:26.417,00:48:28.000,"Wake up, sir."
00:48:28.041,00:48:30.709,Wake up!
00:48:47.792,00:48:49.792,The quilt.
00:49:21.041,00:49:23.291,A noise aroused me from my sleep.
00:49:25.000,00:49:28.166,What noise?
00:49:32.709,00:49:34.417,Stay here.
00:49:40.625,00:49:42.583,Don't make a sound.
00:50:24.375,00:50:27.834,Say nothing about this.
00:50:27.875,00:50:30.166,But-- I'll account for this state of affairs.
00:50:30.208,00:50:31.875,Say nothing.
00:50:33.583,00:50:35.083,"Yes, sir."
00:50:37.667,00:50:39.667,Is that how you would leave me?
00:50:40.917,00:50:43.458,"Jane, fire is a horrible death."
00:50:43.500,00:50:46.041,You've saved my life.
00:50:46.083,00:50:48.417,Don't walk past me as if we were strangers.
00:50:49.417,00:50:51.375,But what am I to do then?
00:51:07.583,00:51:10.208,I have a pleasure in owing you my life.
00:51:13.542,00:51:15.500,There is no debt.
00:51:18.625,00:51:21.250,I knew you would do me good in some way.
00:51:22.542,00:51:25.041,I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you.
00:51:26.625,00:51:30.375,Their expression did not strike my very inmost being so for nothing.
00:51:33.959,00:51:36.291,People talk of natural sympathies.
00:51:38.000,00:51:44.250,"You-- Good night then, sir."
00:51:45.000,00:51:47.166,You will leave me then?
00:51:48.667,00:51:50.667,I am cold.
00:51:53.333,00:51:54.834,Go.
00:52:39.542,00:52:41.959,Has Mr. Rochester not sent for us today?
00:52:42.000,00:52:43.959,"Why, he's gone away."
00:52:44.000,00:52:46.625,Were you not aware?
00:52:48.375,00:52:50.333,He's gone to the Leas.
00:52:50.375,00:52:53.375,It's Mr. Eshton's place.
00:52:53.417,00:52:57.208,I believe Blanche Ingram is there. She's a great favorite of his.
00:52:58.667,00:53:02.166,I saw her two years ago when Mr. Rochester gave a party here.
00:53:02.208,00:53:04.834,She's a most elegant girl.
00:53:04.875,00:53:07.500,They sang a duet together.
00:53:07.542,00:53:10.667,They made a lovely harmony.
00:53:10.709,00:53:13.917,"I was quite surprised he didn't make a proposal, but she has no fortune."
00:53:13.959,00:53:17.333,"In every other way, they'd make a splendid match."
00:53:17.375,00:53:19.417,Perhaps it's his intention now.
00:53:22.834,00:53:25.166,He's far more likely to have gone off to Europe.
00:53:25.208,00:53:30.166,He often goes without so much as a fare-you-well and I don't see him for a year.
00:53:30.208,00:53:32.875,"the burnt linen from the master's room, Mrs. Fairfax."
00:53:32.917,00:53:35.041,That's fine.
00:53:47.542,00:53:50.750,"England is a great power, Adele."
00:53:50.792,00:53:57.542,"British ships set sail from here to the outer limits of our empire, navigating the five oceans and four corners of our world."
00:53:59.166,00:54:04.041,"From Canada here, all the way to the south of Africa..."
00:54:04.083,00:54:06.041,and the Cape of Good Hope.
00:54:06.083,00:54:10.083,Across the Indian Ocean to Australia and New Zealand...
00:54:10.125,00:54:13.917,"and on to Burma, China, India and Malaya."
00:54:16.125,00:54:20.000,"What is wrong, Mademoiselle?"
00:54:20.041,00:54:22.333,Nothing.
00:54:22.375,00:54:25.375,"On these distant horizons, you will find all manner of men."
00:55:09.417,00:55:11.792,He's coming back tomorrow.
00:55:11.834,00:55:14.041,He's given me directions to prepare all the rooms.
00:55:14.083,00:55:16.709,I'm to get more staff from the George Inn.
00:55:17.458,00:55:19.542,Miss Ingram's coming.
00:55:20.875,00:55:24.125,"Supplies to be got-- linen, mattresses."
00:55:24.166,00:55:26.500,I'll go to the George now.
00:55:26.542,00:55:28.500,No. No.
00:55:28.542,00:55:30.875,"Well, may I assist you, Mrs. Fairfax?"
00:55:30.917,00:55:32.333,Oh.
00:55:59.500,00:56:01.041,Whoa.
00:56:01.083,00:56:02.750,There you are.
00:56:10.333,00:56:12.291,Leah.
00:56:12.333,00:56:15.041,The south-facing rooms for Lady Ingram and Miss Ingram.
00:56:15.083,00:56:18.291,Colonel Dent and Mrs. Dent must have the river view.
00:56:21.333,00:56:23.291,I'll wager he will by end of week.
00:56:23.333,00:56:25.333,You mark my words.
00:56:27.083,00:56:28.417,Adele.
00:56:32.583,00:56:35.166,Regardez! Regardez!
00:56:37.417,00:56:39.375,What's she saying?
00:56:39.417,00:56:42.875,Mr. Rochester is here.
00:56:46.792,00:56:48.250,"Oh, she is so beautiful."
00:56:48.291,00:56:50.500,So elegant.
00:56:51.709,00:56:54.125,"Allow me, Miss Ingram."
00:56:57.959,00:57:00.709,I'd forgotten how masculine Thornfield is.
00:57:04.458,00:57:08.291,I think you need more flowers.
00:57:09.542,00:57:11.333,"Come away, Adele."
00:57:11.375,00:57:14.792,Tonight he wants both of you in the drawing room after dinner.
00:57:14.834,00:57:16.917,"Not me, surely?"
00:57:16.959,00:57:21.250,"I'm instructed to tell you, if you resist, he'll come up and get you himself."
00:57:23.417,00:57:25.375,But I don't have a dress.
00:57:25.417,00:57:27.709,"Oh, don't worry, child."
00:57:29.709,00:57:31.667,Mademoiselle.
00:57:34.625,00:57:37.125,"I thought you were not fond of children, Mr. Rochester."
00:57:37.166,00:57:39.166,"Nor am I, Lady Ingram."
00:57:39.208,00:57:43.000,to take charge of her?
00:57:43.041,00:57:47.041,Why don't you send her to school?
00:57:47.083,00:57:51.834,about half a dozen in my day.
00:57:51.875,00:57:54.709,It's true.
00:57:54.750,00:57:57.208,"Mr. Rochester, beware the governess."
00:57:57.250,00:58:00.417,they're generally hysterics.
00:58:00.458,00:58:04.166,I have done with them.
00:58:04.208,00:58:06.208,It's a miracle I survived my education.
00:58:06.250,00:58:09.709,"I remember Miss Wilson screaming, You villainous child!"
00:58:09.750,00:58:12.166,"Blanche, you tried to set her hair on fire."
00:58:12.208,00:58:15.125,"- Frequently, I might add."
00:58:18.709,00:58:22.667,"Anyway, enough of this dreary race."
00:58:22.709,00:58:25.542,and a new subject.
00:58:25.583,00:58:28.083,"Signor Eduardo, what shall it be?"
00:58:28.125,00:58:31.166,I give you beauty.
00:58:31.208,00:58:33.166,I give you back male beauty.
00:58:33.208,00:58:35.792,"Well, that's my son."
00:58:35.834,00:58:39.500,A man should pay no heed to his looks.
00:58:39.542,00:58:43.166,He should possess only strength and valor.
00:58:43.208,00:58:47.542,"Gentleman or highwayman, his beauty lies in his power."
00:58:48.458,00:58:50.417,Then a pirate would do for you?
00:59:22.583,00:59:24.542,Why did you leave the room?
00:59:28.125,00:59:30.041,"I am tired, sir."
00:59:31.083,00:59:33.041,Why didn't you come and speak to me?
00:59:33.083,00:59:35.125,I haven't seen you for weeks.
00:59:35.166,00:59:38.458,It would have been normal and polite to wish me good evening.
00:59:39.875,00:59:42.083,You seemed engaged.
00:59:44.166,00:59:46.083,You look pale.
00:59:46.667,00:59:48.667,I am well.
00:59:49.875,00:59:51.834,What have you been doing while I've been away?
00:59:51.875,00:59:53.417,Teaching Adele.
00:59:56.667,00:59:58.208,You're depressed.
00:59:58.250,01:00:01.333,What's the meaning of this?
00:59:58.250,01:00:03.959,Your eyes are full-- What is it?
01:00:04.000,01:00:06.542,"There's a gentleman to see you, sir."
01:00:06.583,01:00:10.333,"From Spanish Town, Jamaica."
01:00:10.375,01:00:15.417,"And indeed, I think he does come from some hot place, 'cause he won't take off his coat."
01:00:15.458,01:00:17.041,Mr. Richard Mason.
01:00:17.083,01:00:19.792,I've put him in the morning room.
01:00:20.709,01:00:22.625,Have I done wrong?
01:00:25.166,01:00:26.792,Bring him to my study.
01:00:35.333,01:00:37.166,"Jane, this is a blow."
01:00:39.500,01:00:46.250,"If I were to go to those people, and they looked at me coldly and sneered and then left me one by one, what would you do?"
01:00:46.291,01:00:47.959,Would you go with them?
01:00:48.000,01:00:50.041,"No, sir."
01:00:54.041,01:00:56.375,You'd dare condemnation for my sake?
01:00:57.417,01:00:59.750,For the sake of any friend who deserved it.
01:01:06.041,01:01:07.375,Richard.
01:01:09.041,01:01:10.875,Fairfax.
01:01:12.041,01:01:13.875,How the devil are you?
01:01:13.917,01:01:15.417,Splendid.
01:01:17.083,01:01:20.000,"I, uh-- I'm sorry."
01:01:20.041,01:01:22.041,It is no trouble. Come.
01:01:41.333,01:01:43.500,What on earth was that?
01:01:43.542,01:01:45.667,Where is Rochester?
01:01:45.709,01:01:48.834,Please-- I'm here.
01:01:48.875,01:01:51.333,"A servant has had a nightmare, that's all."
01:01:51.375,01:01:56.500,"I must see you back into your rooms because, until the house is settled, she can't be properly looked after."
01:01:56.542,01:01:59.041,Is there anything I might do?
01:01:59.083,01:02:05.792,"Miss Ingram-- Ladies, please return to your nests like the doves that you are."
01:02:05.834,01:02:07.166,I assure you all is well.
01:02:07.208,01:02:09.083,Noisy old house.
01:02:09.125,01:02:11.750,"Come, my lily flower."
01:02:11.792,01:02:13.500,Keep your candle by you.
01:02:13.542,01:02:15.291,Can I sleep in your bed tonight?
01:02:15.333,01:02:17.458,Please.
01:02:24.125,01:02:25.625,Come with me.
01:02:43.792,01:02:46.333,- Can you clean this?
01:02:55.875,01:02:57.750,Yes.
01:02:57.792,01:03:00.542,"Drink, Richard."
01:03:00.583,01:03:02.834,- Will it hurt me?
01:03:02.875,01:03:04.625,I must go for the doctor.
01:03:04.667,01:03:06.500,Sponge the blood away when it returns.
01:03:06.542,01:03:08.792,Give him water if he wants it.
01:03:08.834,01:03:12.000,Do not speak to him for any reason.
01:03:12.041,01:03:15.375,"And, Richard, on pain of death, do not speak to her."
01:05:03.667,01:05:05.917,How does he?
01:05:08.208,01:05:10.375,"Hurry, Carter."
01:05:10.417,01:05:12.458,"The sun will soon rise, and he must be gone."
01:05:12.500,01:05:14.667,"Let's have a look, shall we?"
01:05:14.709,01:05:17.333,Flesh is torn as well as cut.
01:05:17.375,01:05:18.917,"Very, very unpleasant."
01:05:26.875,01:05:29.333,Fairfax.
01:05:29.375,01:05:30.875,Drive.
01:05:33.542,01:05:35.041,Hyah! Hyah!
01:05:49.375,01:05:51.041,It's a strange night you've passed.
01:05:52.083,01:05:54.041,"Yes, sir."
01:05:55.166,01:05:56.875,You showed no fear.
01:05:58.000,01:05:59.792,I was afraid of the inner room.
01:06:00.875,01:06:02.625,You were in no danger.
01:06:02.667,01:06:04.375,"Mr. Rochester, who did that violence?"
01:06:04.417,01:06:06.375,I cannot tell you.
01:06:07.667,01:06:09.583,Why do you protect them?
01:06:11.500,01:06:13.875,I drag through life a capital error.
01:06:15.375,01:06:17.417,Its consequence blights my existence.
01:06:17.458,01:06:20.417,For years I've sought to escape it.
01:06:21.375,01:06:23.208,This spring I came home...
01:06:23.250,01:06:25.542,heartsore and soul-withered.
01:06:26.875,01:06:29.875,And I met a gentle stranger whose society revives me.
01:06:31.083,01:06:33.166,With her I feel I could live again...
01:06:33.208,01:06:34.834,"in a higher, purer way."
01:06:37.208,01:06:42.458,Tell me-- Am I justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom to attain her?
01:06:45.125,01:06:47.041,There is an obstacle?
01:06:47.083,01:06:49.542,A mere conventional impediment.
01:06:50.792,01:06:52.750,But what can it be?
01:06:52.792,01:06:56.625,"If you cherish an affection, sir, then fortune alone cannot impede you."
01:06:57.875,01:06:59.750,Yes.
01:06:59.792,01:07:08.875,"And if the lady is of noble stock and has indicated that she may reciprocate-- Jane, of whom do you think I speak?"
01:07:10.792,01:07:12.709,Of Miss Ingram.
01:07:14.959,01:07:18.375,I'm asking what Jane Eyre would do to secure my happiness.
01:07:19.291,01:07:21.709,"I would do anything for you, sir."
01:07:21.750,01:07:24.208,Anything that was right.
01:07:25.792,01:07:27.792,You transfix me quite.
01:07:32.208,01:07:36.583,"I feel I can speak to you, now, of my lovely one."
01:07:36.625,01:07:39.083,"For you've met her, and you know her."
01:07:40.208,01:07:42.125,"She's a rare one, isn't she?"
01:07:43.125,01:07:45.917,Fresh and healthy.
01:07:45.959,01:07:48.083,Without soil or taint.
01:07:52.083,01:07:55.208,I'm sure she'll regenerate me with a vengeance.
01:09:16.041,01:09:18.542,You look ridiculous.
01:09:18.583,01:09:20.166,This game is ridiculous.
01:09:26.125,01:09:27.625,"Excuse me, sir."
01:09:35.750,01:09:37.667,Does that creeping creature want you?
01:09:37.709,01:09:39.625,Excuse me.
01:09:49.417,01:09:51.625,"This is from my old nurse, Bessie."
01:09:52.709,01:09:55.208,She says my cousin John Reed is dead.
01:09:55.250,01:09:58.417,He squandered his fortune and has committed suicide.
01:09:58.458,01:10:01.333,"The news has so shocked my aunt, it's brought on a stroke."
01:10:01.375,01:10:03.583,"What, the aunt who cast you out?"
01:10:06.417,01:10:08.625,She's been asking for me.
01:10:08.667,01:10:11.583,I parted from her badly and I can't neglect her wishes now.
01:10:19.208,01:10:21.041,Promise me you won't stay long.
01:10:25.709,01:10:27.875,"Mr. Rochester, I've had no wages."
01:10:27.917,01:10:29.875,I need funds for my journey.
01:10:31.750,01:10:33.875,How much do I owe you?
01:10:33.917,01:10:35.750,Thirty pounds.
01:10:47.709,01:10:49.208,Here's 50.
01:10:49.875,01:10:51.709,That's too much.
01:10:51.750,01:10:54.709,"Take your wages, Jane."
01:10:56.750,01:10:58.375,Then I only have 10.
01:11:04.792,01:11:06.667,Now you owe me.
01:11:06.709,01:11:08.709,Indeed I do.
01:11:08.750,01:11:13.041,"Meantime, I shall safeguard it here."
01:11:15.333,01:11:17.709,Do you trust me to keep it?
01:11:18.959,01:11:20.667,"Not a whit, sir."
01:11:21.583,01:11:23.583,You are not to be trusted at all.
01:11:46.041,01:11:47.917,Jane.
01:11:49.750,01:11:51.333,I've twice done you wrong.
01:11:54.667,01:11:57.375,And I broke the vow I made to Reed.
01:11:58.375,01:11:59.875,Please don't think of it.
01:12:02.041,01:12:03.792,Open that box.
01:12:10.875,01:12:12.500,Take out the letter and read it.
01:12:19.041,01:12:21.166,Madam-- Mmm.
01:12:21.208,01:12:25.166,"Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece, Jane Eyre?"
01:12:26.792,01:12:29.333,I desire her to come to me at Madeira.
01:12:29.375,01:12:35.667,"Fortune has blessed my endeavors, and as I am childless, I wish to adopt her and bequeath her at my death..."
01:12:35.709,01:12:38.250,whatever I may have to leave.
01:12:38.291,01:12:40.834,"Yours, John Eyre, Madeira."
01:12:43.875,01:12:45.709,This is dated three years ago.
01:12:45.750,01:12:47.709,Why did I never hear of it?
01:12:51.041,01:12:53.875,Because I wrote and told him you had died of typhus...
01:12:53.917,01:12:56.417,at Lowood School.
01:13:00.542,01:13:03.709,You called the names of the dead down upon me.
01:13:05.792,01:13:07.583,You cursed me.
01:13:09.792,01:13:12.291,I would have loved you if you'd let me.
01:13:15.291,01:13:18.083,You were born to be my torment.
01:13:26.375,01:13:28.625,Then love me or hate me as you will.
01:13:29.625,01:13:31.542,You have my full and free forgiveness.
01:13:35.709,01:13:37.208,Be at peace.
01:13:47.875,01:13:53.041,"My dear uncle, some years ago, my Aunt Reed mistakenly informed you that I had died."
01:13:54.417,01:13:56.667,I'm writing to tell you that I am very much alive...
01:13:56.709,01:13:59.125,and gratified to find I have a relative.
01:14:00.208,01:14:04.500,"I look forward to our correspondence, hoping one day we may meet."
01:14:04.542,01:14:10.166,"I'm currently living at Thornfield Hall, where I am governess to the ward of Mr. Edward Fairfax Rochester."
01:14:16.208,01:14:18.875,"Ah, there you are."
01:14:20.208,01:14:22.083,Just like one of your tricks...
01:14:22.125,01:14:24.291,to steal in along with the twilight.
01:14:26.208,01:14:29.542,"If I dared, I'd touch you to see if you were real."
01:14:31.041,01:14:32.834,"Come, Jane."
01:14:32.875,01:14:34.834,Stay your wandering feet at a friend's threshold.
01:14:41.208,01:14:43.792,"Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness."
01:14:44.750,01:14:46.792,I'm strangely glad to get back again.
01:14:56.166,01:14:58.291,There's been nothing official yet.
01:14:58.333,01:15:01.208,But he's ordered jewels from his bank.
01:15:01.250,01:15:04.041,And he's making preparations to travel to Europe.
01:15:15.375,01:15:17.041,Mademoiselle.
01:15:19.375,01:15:24.542,He's taken to singing-- the operas Miss Ingram favors so well.
01:15:24.583,01:15:27.458,"We'll hear their announcement soon, I'm sure."
01:15:52.542,01:15:54.417,Fine.
01:15:56.417,01:15:58.333,You are to be married.
01:15:59.959,01:16:02.667,I see Mrs. Fairfax has intimated my intention...
01:16:02.709,01:16:05.500,to put my neck into the sacred noose.
01:16:05.542,01:16:09.000,"Adele should go to school, and I must seek another situation."
01:16:14.250,01:16:15.917,"Congratulations, sir."
01:16:39.625,01:16:42.750,"Thornfield is a pleasant place in spring, isn't it?"
01:16:42.792,01:16:44.458,"Yes, sir."
01:16:44.500,01:16:46.542,You'll be sorry to part with it.
01:16:47.583,01:16:49.750,It's always the way with events in life.
01:16:49.792,01:16:51.458,No sooner have you got settled...
01:16:51.500,01:16:53.583,"than a voice cries, Rise and move on."
01:16:55.333,01:16:59.792,"I'll find you a new situation, Jane-- one I hope that you'll accept."
01:16:59.834,01:17:03.667,I shall be ready when your order to march comes.
01:17:03.709,01:17:07.041,Must I really lose a faithful paid subordinate such as yourself?
01:17:07.875,01:17:10.291,You must.
01:17:10.333,01:17:11.834,"We've been good friends, haven't we?"
01:17:13.709,01:17:15.333,"Yes, sir."
01:17:18.875,01:17:26.417,"I've a strange feeling with regard to you, as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs..."
01:17:26.458,01:17:30.250,tightly knotted to a similar string in you.
01:17:30.291,01:17:33.875,"And if you were to leave, I'm afraid that cord of communion would snap."
01:17:36.542,01:17:39.375,Then I have a notion that I'd take to bleeding inwardly.
01:17:42.959,01:17:44.875,"As for you, you'd forget me."
01:17:47.875,01:17:49.208,How?
01:17:50.500,01:17:52.959,I have lived a full life here.
01:17:53.000,01:17:55.792,I have not been trampled on.
01:17:55.834,01:17:59.500,I have not been excluded from every glimpse of what is bright.
01:17:59.542,01:18:03.000,"I have known you, Mr. Rochester."
01:18:03.041,01:18:05.917,And it strikes me with anguish to be torn from you.
01:18:06.625,01:18:08.750,Then why must you leave?
01:18:08.792,01:18:11.125,Because of your wife.
01:18:11.166,01:18:12.834,But you are to be married.
01:18:12.875,01:18:14.709,"Jane, you must stay."
01:18:15.959,01:18:18.125,And become nothing to you?
01:18:19.125,01:18:22.083,Am I a machine without feelings?
01:18:22.125,01:18:26.250,"Do you think that because I am poor, obscure, plain and little..."
01:18:26.291,01:18:29.250,that I am soulless and heartless?
01:18:29.291,01:18:32.041,I have as much soul as you and full as much heart.
01:18:32.083,01:18:38.125,"And if God had blessed me with beauty and wealth, I could make it as hard for you to leave me as it is for I to leave you."
01:18:39.375,01:18:42.250,I'm not speaking to you through mortal flesh.
01:18:42.291,01:18:50.959,"It is my spirit that addresses your spirit, as if we'd passed through the grave and stood at God's feet, equal-- as we are."
01:18:53.959,01:18:58.000,"I am a free human being with an independent will, which I now exert to leave you."
01:18:58.041,01:19:00.291,Then let your will decide your destiny.
01:19:00.333,01:19:02.125,I offer you my hand.
01:19:02.166,01:19:03.834,My heart.
01:19:03.875,01:19:08.834,"Jane, I ask you to pass through life at my side."
01:19:08.875,01:19:11.583,You are my equal and my likeness.
01:19:12.417,01:19:14.041,Will you marry me?
01:19:16.875,01:19:18.417,Are you mocking me?
01:19:18.458,01:19:20.166,Do you doubt me?
01:19:20.208,01:19:22.166,Entirely.
01:19:22.208,01:19:23.834,Your bride is Miss Ingram.
01:19:23.875,01:19:27.625,Miss Ingram-- She is the machine without feelings.
01:19:27.667,01:19:30.166,"It's you, you rare, unearthly thing."
01:19:30.208,01:19:35.083,"Poor and obscure as you are, please accept me as your husband."
01:19:35.125,01:19:37.500,I must have you for my own.
01:19:39.333,01:19:41.291,You wish me to be your wife?
01:19:41.333,01:19:43.458,I swear it.
01:19:43.500,01:19:45.000,You love me?
01:19:45.041,01:19:46.667,I do.
01:19:51.458,01:19:53.333,"Then, sir, I will marry you."
01:20:15.959,01:20:17.500,Come on.
01:20:53.208,01:20:54.583,Good night.
01:20:54.625,01:20:56.166,"Good night, my love."
01:20:56.208,01:20:57.583,Good night.
01:21:08.041,01:21:10.208,Am I a monster?
01:21:10.250,01:21:13.333,Is it so impossible that Mr. Rochester should love me?
01:21:13.375,01:21:15.750,No.
01:21:15.792,01:21:20.542,"I've long noticed you were a sort of pet of his, but you're so young."
01:21:20.583,01:21:23.417,And you're so little acquainted with men.
01:21:25.166,01:21:28.166,"I don't want to grieve you, child, but..."
01:21:28.208,01:21:31.041,let me just put you on your guard.
01:21:31.083,01:21:34.834,"Gentlemen in his position-- Well, let's just say..."
01:21:34.875,01:21:38.542,they're not accustomed to marry their governesses.
01:21:40.291,01:21:44.542,"Until you are wed, distrust yourself as well as him."
01:21:44.583,01:21:46.333,Please.
01:21:46.375,01:21:48.667,Keep him at a distance.
01:21:57.208,01:21:58.709,Come now.
01:22:16.041,01:22:17.542,What is it?
01:22:21.041,01:22:23.041,Jane Eyre with nothing to say?
01:22:24.000,01:22:26.041,Everything seems unreal.
01:22:27.083,01:22:29.000,I am real enough.
01:22:31.000,01:22:33.875,"You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all."
01:23:13.709,01:23:15.458,Let me see.
01:23:15.500,01:23:17.000,Let me see.
01:23:17.667,01:23:18.875,Hey.
01:23:18.917,01:23:21.166,It's in my head.
01:23:59.875,01:24:02.959,"Yes, it's lovely, but you'll get it all creased."
01:24:06.041,01:24:08.208,I will be Jane Eyre no longer.
01:24:09.417,01:24:11.375,Beautiful.
01:24:33.875,01:24:36.375,They're heavy.
01:24:38.125,01:24:40.417,Have the carriage loaded and ready within the hour.
01:24:40.458,01:24:43.125,Oh.
01:24:43.166,01:24:45.166,"Take courage, Jane."
01:24:45.208,01:24:46.709,I will.
01:24:48.417,01:24:49.625,Come.
01:25:13.208,01:25:18.333,"I require and charge you both, as you will answer at the dreadful day of judgment..."
01:25:18.375,01:25:21.500,when the secrets of all hearts shall be revealed...
01:25:21.542,01:25:24.208,that if either of you do know of any impediment...
01:25:24.250,01:25:28.709,"why you may not be joined together lawfully, you do now confess it."
01:25:33.041,01:25:38.041,"Edward Fairfax Rochester, do you take-- The marriage cannot go on!"
01:25:39.792,01:25:43.291,- An insurmountable impediment exists.
01:25:43.333,01:25:47.250,I affirm and can prove-- Proceed.
01:25:47.291,01:25:48.834,that Edward Fairfax Rochester...
01:25:48.875,01:25:56.667,"was 15 years ago married to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, at St. James's Church, Spanish Town, Jamaica."
01:25:56.709,01:26:01.875,"A copy of the register is now in my possession, signed Richard Mason."
01:26:02.917,01:26:20.625,She lives at Thornfield Hall-- This girl knew nothing of this.
01:26:22.291,01:26:24.333,She thought all was fair and legal.
01:26:24.375,01:26:26.333,She never dreamt she was being entrapped...
01:26:26.375,01:26:28.834,into a feigned union with a defrauded wretch.
01:26:34.000,01:26:35.667,"Come, Jane."
01:26:35.709,01:26:37.333,"Come, all of you."
01:26:37.375,01:26:38.875,Meet my wife.
01:26:40.041,01:26:41.583,Get back!
01:26:41.625,01:26:43.834,Go.
01:26:43.875,01:26:46.208,You're 15 years too late.
01:26:49.375,01:26:51.542,"Mrs. Poole-- You ought to give warning, sir."
01:27:05.709,01:27:10.333,This is Bertha Antoinetta Mason-- my wife.
01:27:10.375,01:27:12.041,Antoinetta?
01:27:12.083,01:27:14.166,"It's I, Richard."
01:27:14.208,01:27:18.333,quiet times and her rages.
01:27:20.166,01:27:23.583,The windows are shuttered lest she throw herself out.
01:27:23.625,01:27:27.417,"We have no furniture, as she can make a weapon out of anything."
01:27:27.458,01:27:33.750,"I take her for a turn upon the roof each day, securely held, as she's taken to thinking she can fly."
01:27:40.125,01:27:42.041,My own demon.
01:28:57.959,01:28:59.208,Jane.
01:29:03.250,01:29:05.917,Forgive me.
01:29:09.542,01:29:10.875,Jane.
01:29:14.000,01:29:15.500,No tears.
01:29:15.542,01:29:17.083,Why don't you cry?
01:29:17.125,01:29:20.125,Why not scream at me?
01:29:23.125,01:29:25.750,I need some water.
01:29:27.875,01:29:29.041,Jane.
01:30:26.959,01:30:29.125,How are you now?
01:30:29.166,01:30:31.166,I will be well again soon.
01:30:42.875,01:30:45.083,I know you.
01:30:45.125,01:30:47.709,Talking is of no use.
01:30:50.709,01:30:53.125,"All is changed, sir."
01:30:54.125,01:30:56.291,No. No.
01:30:57.959,01:31:00.375,"Jane, do you love me?"
01:31:07.041,01:31:09.250,Then the essential things are the same.
01:31:10.875,01:31:12.375,Be my wife.
01:31:13.542,01:31:15.917,You have a wife.
01:31:15.959,01:31:19.667,"I pledge you my honor, my fidelity-- You cannot."
01:31:19.709,01:31:22.000,"my love, until death do us part."
01:31:22.041,01:31:24.333,What of truth?
01:31:24.375,01:31:26.166,I would have told you the truth.
01:31:26.208,01:31:28.291,"You are deceitful, sir."
01:31:33.041,01:31:35.000,I was wrong to deceive you.
01:31:35.041,01:31:36.709,It was cowardly.
01:31:38.834,01:31:41.417,"I should have appealed to your spirit, as I do now."
01:31:42.959,01:31:46.333,Bertha Antoinetta Mason.
01:31:46.375,01:31:49.041,She was wanted by my father for her fortune.
01:31:50.208,01:31:52.542,I hardly spoke with her before the wedding.
01:31:55.792,01:31:58.500,I lived with her for four years.
01:31:58.542,01:32:04.709,"Her temper ripened, her vices sprang up, violent and unchaste."
01:32:04.750,01:32:07.333,"Only cruelty would check her, and I'd not use cruelty."
01:32:08.583,01:32:11.000,"I was chained to her for life, Jane."
01:32:12.250,01:32:14.291,Not even the law could free me.
01:32:15.583,01:32:17.500,"Have you ever set foot in a madhouse, Jane?"
01:32:17.542,01:32:19.542,"No, sir."
01:32:19.583,01:32:23.000,The inmates are caged and baited like beasts.
01:32:25.041,01:32:26.875,"I spared her that, at least."
01:32:29.583,01:32:31.125,Jane.
01:32:31.166,01:32:33.583,"I earnestly pity you, sir."
01:32:33.625,01:32:34.917,No.
01:32:37.041,01:32:38.542,No.
01:32:38.583,01:32:41.166,Who would you offend by living with me?
01:32:41.959,01:32:45.041,Who would care?
01:32:45.083,01:32:48.166,You'd rather drive me to madness...
01:32:48.208,01:32:51.875,than break some mere human law?
01:32:53.583,01:32:55.458,I must respect myself.
01:32:56.542,01:32:58.375,Listen to me.
01:32:59.208,01:33:00.750,Listen.
01:33:11.333,01:33:14.375,I could bend you with my finger and my thumb.
01:33:15.875,01:33:18.542,A mere reed you feel in my hands.
01:33:26.667,01:33:32.875,"But whatever I do with this cage, I cannot get at you."
01:33:32.917,01:33:35.083,And it is your soul that I want.
01:33:39.166,01:33:42.083,Why don't you come of your own free will?
01:33:44.041,01:33:45.542,God help me.
01:34:48.041,01:34:49.542,Jane!
01:34:50.291,01:34:52.000,Jane!
01:34:53.875,01:34:56.834,Jane!
01:36:10.542,01:36:12.542,I asked how you were.
01:36:15.166,01:36:16.792,I'm getting on very well.
01:36:17.709,01:36:19.625,Do you find the work too hard?
01:36:20.500,01:36:22.000,Not at all.
01:36:22.875,01:36:25.291,Is the solitude an oppression?
01:36:25.333,01:36:26.834,I hardly have time to notice it.
01:36:26.875,01:36:28.417,"Thank you, girls."
01:36:28.458,01:36:30.041,"Yes, ma'am."
01:36:33.291,01:36:35.250,Then perhaps you are dwelling on things past.
01:36:37.417,01:36:39.625,"When I came to your door, I had nothing."
01:36:41.125,01:36:44.041,"Now I have a home and work, free and honest."
01:36:44.083,01:36:46.792,I thank God for the generosity of my friends.
01:36:49.542,01:36:53.792,"What you had left before I met you, I don't know."
01:36:53.834,01:36:57.375,But I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation to look back.
01:36:58.625,01:37:01.000,That's what I intend to do.
01:37:01.041,01:37:04.375,A year ago I was myself intensely miserable.
01:37:04.417,01:37:06.709,I scorned this weakness.
01:37:07.583,01:37:09.417,I fought hard against it and won.
01:37:16.208,01:37:19.125,I wonder if we do not share the same alloy.
01:37:20.083,01:37:22.166,"You are ambitious, I think."
01:37:22.208,01:37:25.542,And this little school will not hold you for long.
01:37:32.875,01:37:34.375,Is this yours?
01:37:34.417,01:37:35.500,Yes.
01:37:37.709,01:37:39.834,What's the matter?
01:37:39.875,01:37:41.542,Nothing.
01:37:43.583,01:37:45.083,Good night.
01:38:27.709,01:38:29.000,Jane.
01:38:44.166,01:38:45.667,Miss Eyre.
01:38:52.375,01:38:55.083,What brings you from your hearth on a night like this?
01:38:55.125,01:38:56.625,"There is no bad news, I hope?"
01:38:56.667,01:38:59.709,"How easily alarmed you are, Miss Eyre."
01:39:01.625,01:39:03.542,"Please, won't you sit down?"
01:39:03.583,01:39:05.583,"Thank you, Miss Eyre."
01:39:11.166,01:39:13.208,I saw an advertisement in the Times...
01:39:13.250,01:39:17.208,from a solicitor named Briggs inquiring of a Jane Eyre.
01:39:18.792,01:39:20.333,I knew a Jane Elliott.
01:39:22.041,01:39:24.959,This paper resolved my suspicion into certainty.
01:39:27.667,01:39:30.000,And so I wrote to him.
01:39:30.041,01:39:33.291,He told the story of a young governess...
01:39:33.333,01:39:35.667,"and her employer, a Mr. Fairfax Rochester."
01:39:35.709,01:39:37.709,Mr. Rivers.
01:39:40.625,01:39:42.583,"I can guess your feelings, but please hear me."
01:39:46.250,01:39:48.834,"As you know so much, perhaps you'll tell me how he is."
01:39:48.875,01:39:51.291,Who?
01:39:51.333,01:39:53.250,I'm ignorant of all concerning him.
01:39:55.083,01:39:57.000,But he has been seeking me?
01:39:57.041,01:39:58.333,No.
01:39:58.375,01:40:00.208,He hasn't.
01:40:00.959,01:40:02.458,Mr. Briggs has.
01:40:04.166,01:40:05.875,"Well, what does he want with me?"
01:40:05.917,01:40:11.333,"Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. John Eyre of Madeira, is dead."
01:40:12.333,01:40:16.792,"That he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich."
01:40:18.709,01:40:20.208,What?
01:40:20.250,01:40:22.333,You are rich.
01:40:22.375,01:40:24.500,Quite an heiress.
01:40:26.208,01:40:28.375,Will you ask how much you are worth?
01:40:29.583,01:40:31.792,How much am I worth?
01:40:31.834,01:40:33.750,"£20,000."
01:40:37.041,01:40:41.458,"If you had committed a murder, and I'd found you out, you could scarcely look more aghast."
01:40:41.500,01:40:44.000,There must be some mistake.
01:40:44.041,01:40:45.542,Not at all.
01:40:47.834,01:40:51.000,"You look desperately miserable about it, I must say."
01:40:53.208,01:40:54.542,Please...
01:40:55.875,01:40:57.250,sit down.
01:40:57.291,01:40:58.792,I've shocked you.
01:41:19.667,01:41:25.834,"Mr. St. John, the debt I owe to you and your sisters-- Is nothing."
01:41:27.500,01:41:29.417,You saved my life.
01:41:32.458,01:41:34.583,Please write to them.
01:41:34.625,01:41:36.417,This money frees us.
01:41:36.458,01:41:39.083,"They will have 5,000 each, and so will you if you'll take it."
01:41:39.125,01:41:40.500,Certainly not.
01:41:40.542,01:41:43.917,"And if you will accept me as a sister, perhaps we could live together at Moor House."
01:41:43.959,01:41:46.333,I told you the news too quickly.
01:41:46.375,01:41:48.250,You're confused.
01:41:48.291,01:41:50.291,My only relative is dead.
01:41:50.333,01:41:52.583,You have family.
01:41:52.625,01:41:54.583,You cannot know what isolation means.
01:41:54.625,01:41:56.959,And you cannot know what it means to be wealthy.
01:41:57.000,01:41:59.250,I have been alone always.
01:41:59.291,01:42:01.500,I've never had a brother or sisters.
01:42:01.542,01:42:03.583,"Please, let me be yours."
01:42:09.667,01:42:12.166,Are you reluctant to have me?
01:42:12.208,01:42:14.250,"No, Miss Eyre."
01:42:14.291,01:42:15.834,On the contrary.
01:42:15.875,01:42:18.208,I shall write to my sisters as you request.
01:42:19.542,01:42:21.125,Brother.
01:42:28.375,01:42:32.834,We are bid to work while it is day-- Jane.
01:42:32.875,01:42:35.250,for night cometh when no man shall work.
01:42:35.291,01:42:37.166,It's wonderful to see you.
01:42:37.208,01:42:46.000,"Help us to choose the harder path, for as our master is long-suffering, so must we be."
01:42:47.583,01:42:49.333,Amen.
01:42:49.375,01:42:51.250,Amen.
01:42:54.875,01:42:56.583,Good night.
01:42:58.333,01:42:59.834,Good night.
01:43:01.959,01:43:03.583,Good night.
01:43:04.458,01:43:06.625,Is Jane not our sister too?
01:43:16.083,01:43:17.750,Good night.
01:43:28.417,01:43:29.959,Jane.
01:43:36.250,01:43:38.500,I go to India in six weeks.
01:43:40.417,01:43:44.208,"I can see what your gifts are, and why they were given."
01:43:45.375,01:43:47.000,God...
01:43:47.041,01:43:49.208,intended you for a missionary's wife.
01:43:51.917,01:43:53.875,I want to claim you.
01:43:54.875,01:43:56.792,I'm not fit for it.
01:43:58.500,01:44:00.583,I trust you unreservedly.
01:44:01.875,01:44:08.834,"And know this: In you, I recognize a fellow soul."
01:45:18.417,01:45:20.375,I will go with you to India.
01:45:21.375,01:45:22.417,Jane.
01:45:22.458,01:45:24.709,I will go if I may go free.
01:45:25.709,01:45:28.333,Free?
01:45:28.375,01:45:31.625,How can I take out to India a girl of 19 unless she is my wife?
01:45:31.667,01:45:34.667,I love you as a brother.
01:45:34.709,01:45:37.625,My heart is mute.
01:45:38.375,01:45:40.041,Then I must speak for it.
01:45:41.000,01:45:43.000,You've said you'll come.
01:45:43.041,01:45:47.375,"We shall marry, and undoubtedly enough of love would follow."
01:45:51.041,01:45:52.709,Enough of love?
01:45:54.041,01:45:55.792,"Yes, quite enough."
01:45:55.834,01:45:57.166,Of love?
01:45:57.208,01:46:00.750,Yes.
01:46:00.792,01:46:05.709,"Forgive me, but the very name of love is an apple of discord between us."
01:46:05.750,01:46:08.917,"My dear brother, abandon your scheme of marriage."
01:46:08.959,01:46:11.417,Why this refusal?
01:46:11.458,01:46:13.166,It makes no sense.
01:46:13.208,01:46:15.083,I earnestly wish to be your friend.
01:46:15.125,01:46:17.834,You can't give half a sacrifice.
01:46:18.959,01:46:20.500,You must give all.
01:46:20.542,01:46:22.375,To marry you would kill me.
01:46:22.417,01:46:23.917,Kill you?
01:46:26.375,01:46:27.875,Kill you?
01:46:29.291,01:46:31.542,Those words are unfeminine and untrue.
01:46:35.375,01:46:38.792,I know where your heart turns and to what it still clings.
01:46:41.041,01:46:42.625,Say his name.
01:46:46.417,01:46:48.583,Say it. Say it!
01:46:48.625,01:46:50.583,Jane.
01:46:50.625,01:46:53.083,Why have you not yet crushed this lawless passion?
01:46:57.208,01:46:59.166,Jane!
01:46:59.208,01:47:00.959,It offends me and it offends God!
01:47:01.000,01:47:02.709,What is it?
01:47:03.583,01:47:05.500,Where are you?
01:47:07.250,01:47:08.834,Wait for me.
01:47:08.875,01:47:10.834,Why do you speak to the air?
01:47:13.333,01:47:14.500,Jane.
01:47:14.542,01:47:16.083,Jane.
01:47:17.375,01:47:19.000,I am coming.
01:47:19.041,01:47:20.542,Jane!
01:47:55.041,01:47:57.041,"Wait, please, miss."
01:49:39.083,01:49:40.583,Jane Eyre.
01:49:42.500,01:49:44.625,I thought gypsies were come.
01:49:45.792,01:49:48.709,"And then I saw you, and I thought it cannot be."
01:49:48.750,01:49:50.333,You're a ghost.
01:49:53.166,01:49:55.500,No one knows how it started.
01:49:56.917,01:50:06.250,"I expect that Mrs. Poole took too much of the gin and water, and as she slept, the lady, Mrs. Rochester, unhooked the keys."
01:50:06.291,01:50:11.041,She did what she failed to do a year ago-- set the whole place to fire.
01:50:13.583,01:50:19.041,"We would have all perished in the smoke, but Mr. Rochester would not rest till we were all safe."
01:50:20.041,01:50:22.000,Then he went in for her.
01:50:23.333,01:50:28.625,"The flames were tearing up so high, brought men running from the village."
01:50:28.667,01:50:30.625,I saw her standing on the roof.
01:50:30.667,01:50:32.500,The very edge.
01:50:32.542,01:50:36.792,"I heard Mr. Rochester beg her to come down, but..."
01:50:36.834,01:50:38.667,she jumped.
01:50:40.417,01:50:44.750,"Mr. Rochester remained, as if he would not move until the fire consumed him."
01:50:47.333,01:50:49.166,I didn't know.
01:50:50.333,01:50:52.750,I didn't know it was his wife.
01:50:54.291,01:50:56.208,"Why did you run away, child?"
01:50:57.041,01:50:58.792,I would have helped you.
01:50:59.667,01:51:01.917,I had some money saved.
01:51:01.959,01:51:03.834,You could have come to me.
01:51:08.208,01:51:09.875,Where is he?
01:51:51.875,01:51:53.375,Pilot.
01:52:08.083,01:52:09.583,Who's there?
01:52:35.625,01:52:37.375,This hand.
01:52:55.667,01:52:57.166,Jane Eyre.
01:53:01.542,01:53:03.041,Jane Eyre.
01:53:06.458,01:53:08.834,Edward.
01:53:21.041,01:53:23.625,Fairfax Rochester with nothing to say?
01:53:28.417,01:53:30.834,"You are altogether a human being, Jane."
01:53:33.542,01:53:36.000,I conscientiously believe so.
01:53:52.667,01:53:54.250,A dream.
01:54:00.750,01:54:02.417,Awaken then.
