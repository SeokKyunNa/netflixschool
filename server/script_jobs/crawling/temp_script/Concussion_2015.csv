00:00:20.312,00:00:21.772,"On the ball, on the ball."
00:00:21.814,00:00:23.106,"On the ball, let's go."
00:00:23.148,00:00:24.775,Reset.
00:00:24.817,00:00:26.735,"Let's pick it up this time, boys."
00:00:26.777,00:00:28.320,"they got, Coach?"
00:00:28.362,00:00:29.989,"Wall right, wall right."
00:00:30.030,00:00:31.699,Make sure you pick off the flyer.
00:00:31.740,00:00:33.283,"Here we go, here we go."
00:00:40.916,00:00:43.042,"There you go, get it, get it."
00:00:43.084,00:00:44.169,Think fast! There you go.
00:00:45.754,00:00:47.339,-There you go.
00:00:54.847,00:00:57.725,Someone to help me with maximum protection.
00:00:57.766,00:00:59.685,Someone to help me call the play. Mike did.
00:00:59.727,00:01:02.563,Someone to help me get the team in line.
00:01:02.604,00:01:04.773,"Mike controlled it, Mike ran it."
00:01:04.815,00:01:08.443,"We needed him, we used him, we leaned on him."
00:01:08.485,00:01:11.989,-He was our strength in our offense.
00:01:12.031,00:01:15.784,I know this man.
00:01:17.327,00:01:22.541,"Simply, nothing has ever compared to Mike Webster."
00:01:22.583,00:01:32.009,"Ladies and gentlemen, the greatest center in the history of the National Football League, your inductee into the Hall of Fame, number 52, Iron Mike Webster!"
00:01:40.601,00:01:41.727,Uh...
00:01:42.644,00:01:44.939,I'd like to begin...
00:01:44.980,00:01:51.946,"Um, obviously, I want it to be fun, but I want to be truthful."
00:01:51.987,00:01:59.202,"'Cause the people out there are tremendous fans, uh, locally."
00:01:59.244,00:02:21.725,"But as we, uh, as we go through this, I want you to understand the greatest thing that has happened to me in my experience of professional football is to have the opportunity to work with people with a common goal and with the same purpose, and to sacrifice."
00:02:31.568,00:02:37.116,"I'll say this, it's painful playing football, obviously."
00:02:38.325,00:02:47.167,"And, uh, it's not a lot of fun out there to be in two-a-day drills in the heat of the summer, and, uh, banging heads."
00:02:47.208,00:02:48.585,It's not a natural thing.
00:03:02.474,00:03:06.061,I was scared I'd fail.
00:03:07.646,00:03:09.314,I'm still scared of that.
00:03:40.054,00:03:44.432,And all we have to do is finish the game.
00:03:46.476,00:03:49.229,"If we finish, we win."
00:03:53.274,00:03:54.275,Yeah.
00:04:20.635,00:04:28.602,"after a lengthy trial, a death sentence and two appeals, why we would learn anything new from you."
00:04:29.811,00:04:32.606,"Dr. Omalu, do you have a medical degree?"
00:04:33.774,00:04:37.652,"Uh, yes. From the University of Nigeria."
00:04:38.319,00:04:40.530,"At Enugu, Nigeria."
00:04:41.782,00:04:48.622,And I did my residency at Columbia University Medical School in New York.
00:04:48.663,00:04:54.878,"Um, I also have master's degrees in Public Health and Epidemiology."
00:04:54.920,00:05:03.011,"In addition, I am a certified physician executive, uh, with a specialty in Emergency Medicine."
00:05:03.053,00:05:10.644,"And, of course, I'm board-certified in Forensic Pathology, Clinical Pathology and Anatomic Pathology."
00:05:10.685,00:05:16.150,"Uh, my..."
00:05:16.191,00:05:19.027,-While working as a Medical...
00:05:19.069,00:05:23.490,"Uh, I'm also completing my MBA at Carnegie Mellon University."
00:05:25.575,00:05:33.500,"Oh, uh, and, uh, before I came to America, a master's degree in the Theory of Music from the Royal School of Music in London."
00:05:37.838,00:05:41.800,"Oh, but... Oh, your..."
00:05:41.842,00:05:42.926,Um...
00:05:44.469,00:05:49.308,My specialty is the science of death.
00:05:49.348,00:05:54.395,I think more about why people die than I do the way people live.
00:05:58.025,00:06:00.401,Hands of the deceased.
00:06:00.443,00:06:03.197,Broken and dislodged fingernails.
00:06:03.238,00:06:08.785,The hands of a woman who fought wildly for her life and lost.
00:06:10.745,00:06:13.207,"The hands of the defendant, Thomas Chambers."
00:06:13.248,00:06:15.834,"And that is, in fact, the blood of the victim."
00:06:15.876,00:06:18.628,"Now, doesn't that suggest that the state has the right man?"
00:06:18.670,00:06:25.260,"I thought so, until I heard hour 217 of Mr. Chambers' police interview."
00:06:25.302,00:06:29.556,"I heard him very clearly say, I hate blood."
00:06:29.597,00:06:34.477,I had a tooth pulled as a child once and it would not stop bleeding.
00:06:34.519,00:06:36.604,"-So, I got curious."
00:06:36.646,00:06:40.942,Hands. I could not reconcile these conflicting sets of hands.
00:06:40.984,00:06:42.944,"So, my mind..."
00:06:40.984,00:06:48.909,"My mind is... My mind is going mad, and I'm trying to figure out if Thomas Chambers' family has a history of hemophilia."
00:06:48.950,00:06:51.828,"So, I asked his father and, uh, his father said no."
00:06:51.870,00:06:58.001,"But there is a strain of hemophilia, hemophilia A, so rare that it is never tested for."
00:06:58.043,00:07:02.214,Mr. Chambers tested positive for hemophilia A.
00:07:02.256,00:07:07.468,"His hands may have touched the victim, perhaps to aid her, as he claims."
00:07:07.510,00:07:13.934,"If his hands had been the murder weapon, if he had been scratched or bitten, he would have bled to death."
00:07:13.975,00:07:21.316,"If the state of Pennsylvania moves forward to execute, you will be killing an innocent man."
00:08:34.555,00:08:35.765,"Good morning, Gracie."
00:08:35.807,00:08:37.642,"Good morning, Dr. Omalu."
00:08:37.684,00:08:39.644,-Here are the cases for today. Mmm-hmm.
00:08:39.686,00:08:41.021,"Hey, we got a full room today."
00:08:41.062,00:08:42.397,-Cycle 'em through.
00:08:50.364,00:08:52.449,Let's begin with Rachel Green.
00:09:17.349,00:09:20.143,"Okay, Rachel, I need your help."
00:09:21.353,00:09:23.938,We are in this together.
00:09:23.980,00:09:25.565,Please help me find out what happened to you.
00:09:25.606,00:09:26.607,Here we go.
00:09:27.192,00:09:28.527,"Danny, come on."
00:09:33.614,00:09:35.283,Gracie.
00:09:35.325,00:09:38.119,different stuff.
00:10:27.877,00:10:36.803,"Possible causal relationship between self-medication and early head trauma, leading to narcotics abuse and overdose."
00:10:36.844,00:10:39.139,"You're not her shrink, Bennet!"
00:10:39.180,00:10:42.642,"If I know how she lived, I know why she died."
00:10:42.683,00:10:44.561,"And you should be careful, Danny."
00:10:44.603,00:10:46.938,"One day, I may be rushing through your autopsy."
00:10:54.613,00:10:57.491,Dr. Omalu is here to see you.
00:10:57.532,00:11:01.161,"You know the reason you're not back in Nigeria, don't you?"
00:11:01.202,00:11:03.663,"Uh, yes."
00:11:03.704,00:11:05.499,Only less handsome.
00:11:05.540,00:11:06.583,Sit.
00:11:08.835,00:11:11.171,What the hell is going on down there?
00:11:11.212,00:11:13.507,Nothing.
00:11:13.548,00:11:15.091,You're not fine.
00:11:15.133,00:11:18.886,Danny hates your guts.
00:11:18.928,00:11:21.014,I think you're working a little too slow.
00:11:21.055,00:11:22.599,I'm a doctor.
00:11:22.641,00:11:25.935,The dead are my patients.
00:11:25.977,00:11:27.646,But do you have to talk to them?
00:11:27.686,00:11:29.939,"If you have to do that, talk to them in your head."
00:11:31.650,00:11:34.194,And we discussed the knives.
00:11:34.235,00:11:36.488,We're a public agency in Pittsburgh.
00:11:36.530,00:11:38.781,They're expensive.
00:11:38.823,00:11:44.454,Would you want me to cut open your mother with the same knife I used on a serial killer?
00:11:48.249,00:11:49.626,Yes.
00:11:49.668,00:11:51.169,I'd probably request it.
00:11:53.796,00:11:55.507,Cyril.
00:11:55.549,00:11:57.676,You need a girlfriend.
00:11:57.716,00:12:01.555,You need to touch somebody alive every once in a while.
00:12:01.596,00:12:04.432,Living women are...
00:12:01.596,00:12:06.059,"Well, occasionally they're a pain in the ass, but quite often, they're amazing."
00:12:06.100,00:12:07.726,Give it a try.
00:12:07.768,00:12:08.895,Okay.
00:12:08.936,00:12:11.398,Just be a little less of an artist.
00:12:11.439,00:12:14.401,-Fit in a little more.
00:12:14.442,00:12:15.943,It's another death row case.
00:12:15.985,00:12:18.405,The guy's being railroaded.
00:12:18.446,00:12:20.574,"$1,000 for you."
00:12:22.116,00:12:23.117,Cyril.
00:12:55.983,00:12:56.984,Webby.
00:12:58.069,00:12:59.862,"Hey, man."
00:12:59.904,00:13:01.864,I am loving the digs.
00:13:04.158,00:13:05.159,Mike.
00:13:05.993,00:13:07.203,It's Justin.
00:13:09.205,00:13:10.540,"I'll just sit with you for a minute, huh?"
00:13:10.582,00:13:11.832,Yeah.
00:13:25.263,00:13:27.682,"We're all worried about you, man."
00:13:27.724,00:13:29.892,"What are you doing, Mike?"
00:13:29.934,00:13:32.145,-What are y'all doing?
00:13:32.186,00:13:34.105,It's all right. It's just...
00:13:36.857,00:13:38.735,I don't want to go to sleep.
00:13:40.819,00:13:42.905,"I heard you sold your Super Bowl rings, Mike."
00:13:43.948,00:13:45.617,"Your Super Bowl rings, Mike."
00:13:52.831,00:13:54.167,"Mike, hey."
00:13:55.209,00:13:56.711,Pam's your wife.
00:13:58.171,00:13:59.922,-Garrett's your boy.
00:14:04.218,00:14:06.387,I'm starting to forget things.
00:14:08.055,00:14:11.476,I'm saying this crazy crap to my kids.
00:14:11.518,00:14:13.936,I nearly pushed Keana into a wall.
00:14:15.896,00:14:17.357,I never thought I'd do that to her.
00:14:17.398,00:14:18.692,"All right, well, don't..."
00:14:18.733,00:14:20.568,Just don't give up.
00:14:22.236,00:14:27.575,All we got to do is finish the game.
00:14:27.617,00:14:29.869,We'll all be winners. Okay?
00:15:23.005,00:15:24.965,It's good to see you.
00:15:25.007,00:15:26.718,Bennet! A moment?
00:15:26.760,00:15:28.887,"Yes, Father."
00:15:28.928,00:15:31.013,-How are you?
00:15:31.055,00:15:33.015,A young lady from Kenya.
00:15:33.057,00:15:36.269,She came to us a couple weeks ago and she needs our help.
00:15:36.310,00:15:37.978,"Oh, sure. How much do you need, Father?"
00:15:38.020,00:15:41.107,"She needs shelter, Bennet."
00:15:41.148,00:15:43.735,I'm working on my MBA.
00:15:43.777,00:15:45.403,I'm studying.
00:15:45.445,00:15:47.947,She's a nice girl.
00:15:47.988,00:15:49.532,Went to British school.
00:15:49.574,00:15:51.117,She wants to work.
00:15:51.158,00:15:53.787,We're letting her tidy up around the church.
00:15:53.828,00:15:58.124,We're asking you because we know she'll be safe and cared for.
00:15:58.165,00:16:00.960,"I feel God in you, Bennet."
00:16:01.001,00:16:02.002,"Thank you, Father."
00:16:05.298,00:16:06.674,Who is she?
00:16:37.831,00:16:38.957,"So, uh..."
00:16:40.541,00:16:41.960,You can see.
00:16:50.009,00:16:54.555,"That is, uh, basically my office, there."
00:17:04.273,00:17:07.276,"Ah, yes. The chief."
00:17:07.694,00:17:08.778,Um...
00:17:10.154,00:17:11.823,Those are my peaches.
00:17:12.866,00:17:14.033,They should not be here.
00:17:15.660,00:17:17.036,Your room.
00:17:17.077,00:17:20.247,"Uh, your room. There is a..."
00:17:20.289,00:17:22.542,"The key, I have it for you."
00:17:24.418,00:17:25.670,Um...
00:17:27.213,00:17:30.257,How are you for...
00:17:30.299,00:17:31.425,I have some.
00:17:37.097,00:17:39.559,Need is not weak.
00:17:41.227,00:17:43.813,Need is need.
00:17:45.648,00:17:47.692,I know where you are.
00:17:47.734,00:17:49.027,I was you.
00:17:51.487,00:17:54.114,You're in America now.
00:17:54.156,00:17:57.994,"So, you have to be the best version of yourself."
00:17:59.286,00:18:03.666,"If you don't know what that is, you pick something and fake it."
00:18:04.584,00:18:06.252,"So, I will just..."
00:18:07.086,00:18:08.922,"There, for you."
00:18:08.963,00:18:10.798,What did you pick?
00:18:10.840,00:18:12.759,-What did I pick?
00:18:12.800,00:18:17.847,I picked an older bald-headed white man.
00:18:17.889,00:18:21.141,Why an older bald-headed white man?
00:18:23.019,00:18:26.022,Because he is the best at what he does.
00:18:27.690,00:18:29.650,Do you want to see your room?
00:18:45.124,00:18:49.670,I was a registered nurse at the Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi.
00:18:52.423,00:18:53.841,I understand.
00:18:54.550,00:18:56.302,I meant no offense.
00:19:02.683,00:19:04.435,"Hey, wake up!"
00:19:04.477,00:19:06.938,"Hey! Wake up, you."
00:19:06.980,00:19:09.565,"Come on, now."
00:19:09.607,00:19:11.609,"Put down your window, let's go!"
00:19:18.866,00:19:20.827,"You're Mike Webster, right?"
00:19:20.868,00:19:23.162,Iron Mike.
00:19:23.203,00:19:25.289,He's coming.
00:19:25.331,00:19:27.000,"Okay, but I don't see him."
00:19:28.459,00:19:29.543,Oh.
00:19:30.628,00:19:33.798,"Come on, come on."
00:19:37.468,00:19:39.512,"Oh, what? What is..."
00:19:46.393,00:19:47.394,"Oh, look at that."
00:19:53.860,00:19:55.111,"Hey, Mike."
00:19:55.153,00:19:56.863,"-Look, can you, uh..."
00:19:56.904,00:19:59.448,"Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:19:59.490,00:20:02.952,"You just have to tell me what to do, because I am..."
00:20:02.994,00:20:04.829,I am freaking overwhelmed.
00:20:04.871,00:20:06.455,"We're gonna get you some help, Mike."
00:20:06.497,00:20:07.957,What are you taking right now?
00:20:08.749,00:20:10.417,"Oh, the Ritalin."
00:20:10.459,00:20:12.378,"Dexedrine, Prozac, Klonopin, you're still taking all of those?"
00:20:12.419,00:20:13.546,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:20:13.587,00:20:14.839,"Come sit down, Mike."
00:20:14.881,00:20:16.340,"All of it, okay?"
00:20:16.382,00:20:18.092,-Okay.
00:20:18.134,00:20:21.554,3.5 Haldol.
00:20:21.595,00:20:22.847,He's a lot worse.
00:20:22.889,00:20:24.557,You were my doctor.
00:20:24.598,00:20:25.850,I was the team doctor.
00:20:25.892,00:20:28.811,"Okay! Okay, all right, then, the team doctor!"
00:20:28.853,00:20:30.521,All right? The team doctor!
00:20:30.563,00:20:32.565,All right?
00:20:32.606,00:20:34.567,-I am gonna help you.
00:20:34.608,00:20:37.403,You got to fix this!
00:20:37.444,00:20:39.072,"In here, all right?"
00:20:39.113,00:20:42.783,And in here.
00:20:42.825,00:20:44.451,"-I'm dying in here, all right?"
00:20:44.493,00:20:46.079,"I hear you, Mike."
00:20:46.120,00:20:47.454,It's okay.
00:20:49.373,00:20:51.542,"Let me give you something to help you rest, Mike."
00:20:51.584,00:20:53.419,"You want to rest, don't you?"
00:20:53.460,00:20:57.840,"I just want you to help me, all right?"
00:20:57.882,00:20:59.092,"I will help you, Mike."
00:20:59.133,00:21:00.551,Just help me. Just...
00:21:01.844,00:21:04.097,-Come and sit down.
00:21:04.138,00:21:05.765,-Come and sit down.
00:21:10.770,00:21:12.897,"Well, go ahead, give me the drugs, give me the drugs."
00:21:12.939,00:21:15.149,Show me how you're gonna help me.
00:21:15.191,00:21:16.692,"-Don't move, Mike."
00:21:17.317,00:21:18.360,Ow!
00:21:20.696,00:21:22.031,"Come and sit down, Mike."
00:21:23.824,00:21:24.909,Ooh.
00:21:27.161,00:21:28.704,-Ooh.
00:21:33.751,00:21:35.669,"You rest now, Mike."
00:21:39.799,00:21:41.425,What am I missing?
00:21:42.051,00:21:44.386,-Tumor?
00:21:44.428,00:21:47.098,All of his scans were clean.
00:22:23.843,00:22:30.183,"the dauntless Webster had abandoned his family, slipped into financial chaos and homelessness."
00:22:30.224,00:22:33.602,This is a hard day for the city of Pittsburgh.
00:22:30.224,00:22:41.527,"On a personal note, I can remember sitting down with my father and him giving me examples of hard work ethic and telling me when you get knocked down, you get back up again."
00:22:41.568,00:22:44.780,"I'm sorry, uh, I don't usually watch TV."
00:22:45.572,00:22:47.533,Then why do you have one?
00:22:47.574,00:22:50.244,One has a TV in this country.
00:22:59.837,00:23:02.673,"Oh, I'm sorry, I don't usually eat breakfast."
00:23:04.091,00:23:06.719,One should eat breakfast in this country.
00:23:18.564,00:23:24.570,"Dear God, thank You for the gifts You have so graciously bestowed upon us."
00:23:24.611,00:23:28.574,Please help us to continue to be deservant of Your blessings.
00:23:28.615,00:23:29.700,Amen.
00:23:30.450,00:23:32.203,Bennet!
00:23:32.245,00:23:36.498,"he was rushed to the nearby hospital, football Hall of Famer, Iron Mike Webster..."
00:23:36.540,00:23:37.917,What is going on?
00:23:37.958,00:23:39.252,Mike Webster.
00:23:39.293,00:23:40.586,Who's Mike Webster?
00:23:40.627,00:23:42.213,He's the greatest center to ever play the game.
00:23:42.255,00:23:43.297,He's a true warrior.
00:23:43.797,00:23:44.840,Um...
00:23:44.882,00:23:46.675,I'm sorry. What is a center?
00:23:46.717,00:23:48.177,The big guy in the middle.
00:23:48.219,00:23:50.388,My kid plays football because of this guy.
00:23:50.428,00:23:52.390,"Okay, I'm sorry."
00:23:52.430,00:23:55.684,"Well, if you're gonna live in this town, you gonna work in this town, football is a good thing."
00:23:55.726,00:23:57.519,I freaking can't believe it's you.
00:23:57.561,00:24:00.480,"Well, as you know, I was put on the schedule for this weekend."
00:24:00.522,00:24:02.691,I am put on the schedule for every weekend.
00:24:02.733,00:24:05.403,Come on. Come on.
00:24:09.365,00:24:11.658,The whole town was out of work.
00:24:11.700,00:24:14.412,He was a guy who gave us hope when there really was no hope.
00:24:14.452,00:24:17.331,Just leave him be.
00:24:23.421,00:24:27.174,He was pulling them out and supergluing them back in.
00:24:29.593,00:24:31.553,"Gracie, full autopsy, please."
00:24:31.595,00:24:34.472,"Hey, come on, man."
00:24:34.514,00:24:41.021,Why does an apparently healthy favorite son of this city become self-mutilating and homeless at 50?
00:24:42.564,00:24:46.152,"Cardiac arrest may be how he died, but not why."
00:24:46.193,00:24:47.236,"Prepare the body, please."
00:24:47.278,00:24:48.446,Yes.
00:24:54.327,00:25:00.458,"I think what he's saying is that sometimes in life, you know, you just..."
00:25:00.498,00:25:03.002,You're asked to leave it alone.
00:25:03.043,00:25:05.045,"But, uh, sometimes you can't."
00:25:05.087,00:25:07.006,Mmm.
00:25:07.047,00:25:10.634,Do you believe that he thinks this is a time that I should leave it alone?
00:25:10.676,00:25:13.012,"No, I don't."
00:25:13.053,00:25:14.472,I never leave it alone.
00:25:14.512,00:25:16.514,That's why people hate me.
00:26:02.311,00:26:03.437,Mike.
00:26:05.064,00:26:07.816,People are saying bad things about you.
00:26:09.151,00:26:11.445,I can tell something is wrong.
00:26:12.321,00:26:14.490,But I can't do this alone.
00:26:14.532,00:26:18.285,I need your help to tell the world what happened to you.
00:27:25.018,00:27:27.605,"Oh, uh, sorry. Um..."
00:27:29.982,00:27:32.025,Regular folds of gray matter.
00:27:33.026,00:27:34.903,No obvious contusions.
00:27:35.862,00:27:39.366,No shrinkage from Alzheimer's.
00:27:48.208,00:27:51.086,"Uh, can you show me the CT scan again, please?"
00:27:56.758,00:27:58.093,How old are these?
00:28:16.778,00:28:18.947,This brain should be a mess.
00:28:22.201,00:28:24.077,-But it looks completely normal.
00:28:26.372,00:28:31.377,"Records say severe headaches, double vision, voices in his head."
00:28:32.545,00:28:34.547,No documented concussions.
00:28:34.588,00:28:36.965,He did complain of dizziness.
00:28:37.007,00:28:39.385,-Yes. How often?
00:28:39.426,00:28:42.095,In 18 years of professional football?
00:28:45.057,00:28:46.933,Sign the certificate.
00:28:50.145,00:28:52.981,"Fix the brain, please."
00:28:53.023,00:28:56.276,You know we don't have the budget to do that.
00:28:56.318,00:28:58.404,People do not go mad for no reason.
00:28:58.445,00:28:59.613,I'm going to continue looking.
00:28:59.655,00:29:01.781,"No, you're not going to."
00:29:01.823,00:29:03.742,"Danny, you are out of line."
00:29:03.783,00:29:06.161,"Hey, you do not speak to me like that!"
00:29:06.203,00:29:07.871,-I am the pathologist on duty!
00:29:07.913,00:29:10.040,-I am the pathologist of record!
00:29:10.082,00:29:11.750,This is not your laboratory!
00:29:11.791,00:29:14.503,My hands are on this body!
00:29:14.545,00:29:17.339,-And you are wrong.
00:29:17.381,00:29:19.174,Fix that brain.
00:29:19.216,00:29:22.386,"Hey, I am gonna make sure they don't pay for any of this."
00:29:22.428,00:29:25.264,I am going to write my orders for the tests that I need.
00:29:25.305,00:29:26.599,And you're paying for it yourself.
00:29:26.640,00:29:27.849,"Yes, Danny."
00:29:27.891,00:29:29.727,"Please, exit my workplace."
00:29:35.941,00:29:39.737,I've never requested a panel of tests like this.
00:29:39.778,00:29:41.447,What are you looking for?
00:29:41.488,00:29:54.084,There is not a single case in a book or in life where a man that healthy went that mad that young with no visible abnormality of the brain.
00:29:55.669,00:29:57.963,I don't know what I'm looking for.
00:30:00.758,00:30:03.218,It's going to cost you a fortune.
00:30:03.260,00:30:04.511,I understand.
00:30:05.178,00:30:06.639,Okay.
00:30:06.680,00:30:10.850,"Well, if you have to play hero, just make sure we both come out okay."
00:30:51.141,00:30:54.936,Dr. Omalu.
00:30:54.978,00:30:56.522,"Oh, thank you."
00:31:24.675,00:31:27.219,It's very late.
00:31:31.849,00:31:34.226,I got a job.
00:31:34.267,00:31:36.895,-Look at you.
00:31:38.480,00:31:41.358,At a home.
00:31:41.400,00:31:43.527,That is fantastic.
00:31:45.612,00:31:47.030,What is that?
00:31:48.198,00:31:49.658,Mike Webster.
00:31:56.790,00:31:58.542,"...phrase is worth $1,000."
00:31:58.584,00:31:59.877,And here we go.
00:32:02.796,00:32:06.216,Would you like me to get you a TV for your room?
00:32:07.885,00:32:10.387,No. This one will be fine.
00:32:11.680,00:32:13.181,"Oh, okay."
00:32:25.277,00:32:27.946,I can't tell what you're more afraid of.
00:32:27.987,00:32:31.283,"What you will find, or what you won't."
00:32:32.743,00:32:33.744,Hmm.
00:33:58.912,00:34:00.205,My God.
00:34:05.084,00:34:06.336,My God.
00:34:31.528,00:34:34.614,...Jacked up from those guys that are gonna be racing those sides on this.
00:34:34.656,00:34:36.616,Let's get to Jacked Up Number 5.
00:34:36.658,00:34:39.244,We're gonna begin with the Rams and the Chargers.
00:34:39.285,00:34:42.455,Mark Bulger gonna be delivering the ball to Tony Fisher.
00:34:42.497,00:34:44.332,Throws it down around his feet.
00:34:44.374,00:34:47.293,"So, Donnie Edwards is gonna level him right there."
00:34:47.335,00:34:50.088,Always be looking out for the big hit right there.
00:34:50.129,00:34:53.466,-Tony Fisher got jacked up!
00:34:53.508,00:34:56.344,"Number 4, the Seahawks and the Chiefs."
00:34:56.386,00:35:01.224,D.J. Hackett is gonna make the catch and Ty Law will launch him backwards.
00:35:01.266,00:35:03.602,How far backwards?
00:35:03.643,00:35:06.145,Eyes on me! Gentlemen!
00:35:07.439,00:35:09.816,This is a game of awareness.
00:35:09.858,00:35:13.612,It is a game of desire.
00:35:15.196,00:35:19.952,"When I blow this whistle three times, you seek out a teammate."
00:35:19.993,00:35:23.496,"You make collision, you be physical, you be violent!"
00:35:23.538,00:35:24.957,"Bring it in here, let's go!"
00:35:28.460,00:35:33.214,"you're gonna get this player's hands off you, you grab him by the throat and you squeeze!"
00:35:33.256,00:35:37.636,You choke him until shit runs down his leg!
00:35:53.068,00:35:54.987,Drive! Drive! Hit him!
00:35:55.028,00:35:57.656,Hit it! Drive! Drive!
00:35:57.697,00:35:59.825,and the Eagles. Dirk Johnson.
00:35:59.866,00:36:05.288,And I'm gonna wait for this because the look on his face -tells you that he got jacked up!
00:36:11.252,00:36:21.346,"And our Number 1 hit of the week, Jon Kitna dropping back the pass, and Shawntae Spencer lifts him off his feet!"
00:36:21.387,00:36:25.684,"-Oh, my God!"
00:36:48.915,00:36:51.417,"You should see this, Bennet."
00:36:54.462,00:36:57.423,It's actually really beautiful.
00:36:57.465,00:37:00.760,"Priest Holmes, he's diving."
00:37:00.802,00:37:03.096,"Oh, tremendous!"
00:37:06.183,00:37:08.518,I want to show you something.
00:37:08.560,00:37:14.858,A human brain sits in a fluid completely disconnected from the human skull.
00:37:51.477,00:37:54.773,"Bennet, will you relax?"
00:38:04.699,00:38:07.077,This is a really terrible brain.
00:38:09.246,00:38:11.372,the great DeKosky before?
00:38:11.414,00:38:13.416,"Expect two minutes, tops."
00:38:15.334,00:38:17.129,Is that him?
00:38:17.170,00:38:18.588,"So, you're our prize graduate."
00:38:39.192,00:38:40.735,Tell him.
00:38:40.777,00:38:42.028,It's Mike Webster.
00:38:43.321,00:38:44.405,The Pittsburgh...
00:38:44.447,00:38:46.032,I know who Mike Webster is.
00:38:47.575,00:38:48.868,He was 50.
00:39:04.467,00:39:06.303,You have my attention.
00:39:13.310,00:39:15.145,The Cape gannet.
00:39:15.187,00:39:23.736,"A diving bird capable of generating speeds of up to 75 miles per hour, turning itself into a missile as it collides with the face of the sea."
00:39:26.072,00:39:36.041,"The red-head woodpecker can absorb a G-force of 1,000, pecking a tree 12,000 times per day, 85 million times over its lifetime."
00:39:40.253,00:39:42.463,Bighorn sheep can generate...
00:39:42.505,00:39:43.756,-Bennet.
00:39:45.591,00:39:49.387,"Okay, okay."
00:39:49.428,00:39:53.850,All of these animals have shock absorbers built into their bodies.
00:39:53.892,00:39:59.689,"The woodpecker's tongue extends through the back of the mouth out of the nostril, encircling the entire cranium."
00:39:59.731,00:40:04.361,It is the anatomical equivalent of a safety belt for its brain.
00:40:04.944,00:40:06.779,Human beings?
00:40:06.821,00:40:12.244,Not a single piece of our anatomy protects us from those types of collisions.
00:40:12.285,00:40:16.581,A human being will get concussed at 60 G's.
00:40:16.622,00:40:19.959,A common head-to-head contact on a football field?
00:40:21.127,00:40:23.296,One hundred G's.
00:40:25.131,00:40:28.885,God did not intend for us to play football.
00:40:28.927,00:40:31.263,Let's keep God out of this.
00:40:34.766,00:40:36.517,"Um, okay. Look."
00:40:44.734,00:40:46.778,"Uh, the Steelers."
00:40:46.819,00:40:49.281,"-The others, obviously."
00:40:49.322,00:40:50.698,"Yes, the other team."
00:40:50.740,00:40:52.658,Do you even watch football?
00:40:52.700,00:40:54.244,"Uh, no, not at all."
00:40:54.286,00:40:56.955,But I've been studying Mike Webster's position.
00:40:56.996,00:41:01.709,The man in the middle is quite deceptively the most violent position on the field.
00:41:01.751,00:41:03.920,"The slaps, the punches, the forearm."
00:41:03.962,00:41:07.299,It is an unremitting storm of sub-concussive blows.
00:41:07.340,00:41:19.518,"The head as a weapon on every single play of every single game of every single practice, from the time he was a little boy to a college man, culminating in an 18-year professional career."
00:41:20.395,00:41:28.111,"By my calculations, Mike Webster sustained more than 70,000 blows to his head."
00:41:30.029,00:41:35.410,"Now, now, these men, these men, these are the fastest."
00:41:35.452,00:41:45.462,"Now, their speed multiplied by the speed of the men who hit them, the G-forces generated equivalent to hitting them on the helmet with a sledgehammer."
00:41:46.171,00:42:03.021,"All of this triggered a cascading series of neurological events which unleashed killer proteins upon Mike Webster's brain, the tangles invading and strangling his mind from the inside out."
00:42:03.062,00:42:07.400,Like pouring wet concrete down kitchen pipes.
00:42:07.442,00:42:15.908,"As it hardens, it chokes the brain, leaving him unrecognizable, even to himself."
00:42:17.410,00:42:21.289,I don't know football.
00:42:21.331,00:42:26.711,But I am telling you that playing football killed Mike Webster.
00:42:28.254,00:42:30.715,And I am certain that there are others.
00:42:30.756,00:42:33.385,And how can you possibly know that?
00:42:33.426,00:42:35.136,Common sense.
00:42:35.178,00:42:38.681,But they are either dead or lost in the way that Mike Webster was lost.
00:42:38.723,00:42:41.142,I'm not interested in common sense.
00:42:41.184,00:42:43.353,I'm interested in science.
00:42:43.395,00:42:45.313,And science is knowing.
00:42:45.355,00:42:54.406,"I know from these players' records that their doctors believe they have early Alzheimer's, which is statistically impossible."
00:42:54.447,00:42:56.949,They're too young.
00:42:56.991,00:42:59.536,Because it's not Alzheimer's.
00:43:00.286,00:43:01.579,It is this.
00:43:26.020,00:43:27.522,No.
00:43:27.564,00:43:29.357,"No, actually, I hate it."
00:43:30.525,00:43:36.489,"But as a scientist, I can't deny it."
00:43:37.656,00:43:40.659,Name it.
00:44:06.519,00:44:08.854,"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:44:10.106,00:44:13.568,Did they agree what it is?
00:44:15.361,00:44:17.863,"Yes, yes."
00:44:19.157,00:44:20.825,They...
00:44:20.866,00:44:22.535,-With you?
00:44:23.369,00:44:24.996,In a medical journal.
00:44:26.247,00:44:27.499,With you?
00:44:27.540,00:44:31.127,Together.
00:44:31.169,00:44:32.837,That's so...
00:44:35.548,00:44:37.967,Congratulations.
00:44:38.009,00:44:39.802,-Thank you. Thank you.
00:44:43.097,00:44:44.932,"Uh, you, um..."
00:44:45.891,00:44:47.893,Are you going somewhere?
00:44:48.686,00:44:49.770,Yes.
00:44:50.563,00:44:51.897,With you.
00:44:53.065,00:44:54.484,To celebrate.
00:45:10.916,00:45:13.211,"You don't dance, do you?"
00:46:54.895,00:46:58.775,I had quite a revelation tonight.
00:47:01.569,00:47:04.614,-This body was made for dancing.
00:47:04.656,00:47:07.824,"When they say dancing machine, I am what they mean."
00:47:09.868,00:47:12.664,I'm very proud of you.
00:47:16.959,00:47:18.002,Okay.
00:47:42.859,00:47:44.570,May I kiss you?
00:48:33.745,00:48:36.873,It's very weird to bring women into the morgue at night.
00:48:36.913,00:48:38.040,She is a friend.
00:48:38.082,00:48:40.543,You don't have friends.
00:48:40.585,00:48:42.587,"Listen, Danny knows she's been in there."
00:48:42.628,00:48:44.380,He's thinking about filing a formal complaint.
00:48:46.424,00:48:48.217,I was working on Webster.
00:48:48.259,00:48:50.177,I know.
00:48:50.219,00:48:52.471,How much has that cost you so far?
00:48:53.180,00:48:54.265,"$20,000."
00:48:54.306,00:48:55.307,Twenty?
00:48:55.932,00:48:57.769,I save.
00:48:57.810,00:49:00.563,-Everything.
00:49:02.189,00:49:04.442,"Well, maybe it was worth it."
00:49:04.483,00:49:06.193,I got the call.
00:49:06.235,00:49:08.654,Chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
00:49:08.696,00:49:10.489,"Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?"
00:49:10.531,00:49:12.241,Yes. CTE.
00:49:12.283,00:49:14.034,"So, what happens now?"
00:49:14.076,00:49:16.995,"We publish. Uh, DeKosky is going to coauthor."
00:49:17.996,00:49:19.498,-DeKosky?
00:49:19.540,00:49:23.711,"Omalu, DeKosky and Cyril Wecht."
00:49:24.837,00:49:25.838,Oh.
00:49:27.339,00:49:28.841,"Well, I'm very proud of you."
00:49:30.008,00:49:31.968,Thank you.
00:49:32.010,00:49:34.221,See?
00:49:34.263,00:49:36.682,"The blue shows the dirt, even in the rain."
00:49:36.724,00:49:38.267,Here you go.
00:49:45.733,00:49:47.652,"Let's go, baby!"
00:49:48.861,00:49:50.613,"Come on, get it, get it, get it!"
00:49:50.655,00:49:54.283,And watch the play-action.
00:49:54.325,00:49:56.160,And look at that touch by Ben Roethlisberger.
00:49:56.201,00:49:58.830,And Plaxico Burress does a great job.
00:49:58.871,00:50:00.038,-Looked like he tripped...
00:50:00.080,00:50:01.123,You may not!
00:50:02.500,00:50:05.503,"I say not to, but he does."
00:50:05.544,00:50:09.548,scrambling out of the pocket.
00:50:09.590,00:50:11.884,Throwing across the middle!
00:50:11.926,00:50:14.679,Burress at the 45!
00:50:15.847,00:50:17.932,"And if you don't know, Plaxico!"
00:50:21.435,00:50:25.105,Yeah. That was a pressure toss by the rook.
00:50:27.692,00:50:29.568,-I'm hearing voices.
00:50:29.610,00:50:31.988,-They're just talking.
00:50:32.028,00:50:33.447,You're scaring them.
00:50:33.489,00:50:34.615,Look at me!
00:50:35.950,00:50:37.493,-They're telling me to kill you.
00:50:37.535,00:50:39.996,They're telling me to kill you!
00:50:42.414,00:50:44.166,Get out! Get out!
00:50:45.041,00:50:46.293,Get out!
00:50:57.763,00:50:58.806,No!
00:51:01.851,00:51:03.561,No!
00:51:03.602,00:51:06.438,"All units, black pickup spotted on thruway eight miles..."
00:51:06.480,00:51:08.607,Just passing me. Where am I?
00:51:08.649,00:51:11.819,driving into opposite traffic last 10 miles.
00:51:13.278,00:51:14.989,Pickup has collided.
00:51:15.031,00:51:16.657,Reported collision.
00:51:34.967,00:51:46.896,"after Steeler favorite Justin Strzelczyk was killed in that fiery accident, yet another Steeler favorite, Terry Long, has apparently committed suicide at the age of 45."
00:51:48.773,00:51:50.816,You wonder where they are now?
00:51:53.318,00:51:55.446,"Terry Long, Pittsburgh Steelers."
00:51:55.487,00:51:57.573,I guess these guys only die when you're working.
00:51:58.657,00:52:00.367,What other problems did he have?
00:52:00.409,00:52:02.244,Arrested a few times.
00:52:02.286,00:52:04.830,"Fraud, federal theft."
00:52:04.872,00:52:06.498,"Wow, arrested a lot."
00:52:06.540,00:52:08.292,I need a full autopsy.
00:52:08.333,00:52:09.794,Same tests as Mike Webster.
00:52:09.835,00:52:11.211,"You're paying for that, too?"
00:52:11.253,00:52:13.672,"Yes, Danny, I'm paying for that, too."
00:52:19.470,00:52:21.097,Joseph Maroon.
00:53:23.408,00:53:25.243,The schools are good.
00:53:27.329,00:53:29.081,"You are good, Prema."
00:53:32.835,00:53:35.004,I'm sure you see good in me.
00:53:36.672,00:53:39.758,I see all that you are.
00:53:42.845,00:53:44.638,I want to marry you.
00:53:47.766,00:53:49.601,We can fall in love.
00:53:57.026,00:54:02.406,"If you want to marry me, I will marry you."
00:54:04.200,00:54:07.578,"That is good, because I already made the down payment."
00:54:12.208,00:54:16.294,I saved all my money and I bought this for you.
00:54:56.252,00:54:58.087,Get me Elliot Pellman.
00:55:14.019,00:55:16.730,I have Chris Jones for you.
00:55:16.772,00:55:17.856,I'm just looking at it.
00:55:19.566,00:55:21.568,Anything to be concerned about?
00:55:21.610,00:55:24.905,"This Omalu, he's a coroner in Pittsburgh."
00:55:24.947,00:55:27.741,"He looks like a nobody, but let me get into it."
00:55:27.783,00:55:28.993,All right.
00:55:47.219,00:55:50.181,-Hello?
00:55:50.222,00:55:52.308,"Uh, yes, he is."
00:55:52.724,00:55:53.725,Okay.
00:55:54.559,00:55:56.352,Yes.
00:55:56.394,00:55:58.022,I'm a neurologist who's worked around football for years.
00:55:58.063,00:56:00.983,Very familiar with the NFL's concussion research.
00:56:01.025,00:56:05.988,And the League concluded unequivocally that football players do not get brain damage.
00:56:06.030,00:56:08.991,"Webster is one random case, Mr. Omalu."
00:56:09.033,00:56:10.909,Dr. Omalu.
00:56:10.951,00:56:13.996,"Well, whatever."
00:56:17.082,00:56:19.335,you were uneducated?
00:56:19.375,00:56:21.962,Did they even read your resume?
00:56:22.004,00:56:24.006,"Well, I got calls, too."
00:56:24.048,00:56:27.634,"Apparently, the National Football League owns neuroscience."
00:56:27.676,00:56:28.802,Who knew?
00:56:28.844,00:56:30.512,Failure to find.
00:56:30.554,00:56:33.182,Absence of clinical information.
00:56:33.224,00:56:35.684,-What do they want?
00:56:35.726,00:56:38.103,They want you to retract your findings.
00:56:38.145,00:56:40.564,They want you to say you made it all up.
00:56:42.233,00:56:45.069,-I made it up?
00:56:45.110,00:56:48.530,"If you retract, you'll be fine."
00:56:50.241,00:56:51.825,Why...
00:56:51.867,00:56:53.369,They're terrified of you.
00:56:53.409,00:56:55.913,What did you think they were gonna say?
00:56:55.954,00:56:57.122,Yes.
00:56:57.164,00:56:58.374,What the hell for?
00:56:58.414,00:57:00.084,For being told.
00:57:00.125,00:57:01.377,For knowing.
00:57:02.961,00:57:04.922,"Oh, I understand."
00:57:04.963,00:57:06.965,You think you're being a good American.
00:57:09.760,00:57:18.435,"So, the city of Pittsburgh spent $233 million to build their glorious Steelers a new stadium."
00:57:18.476,00:57:23.690,"All the while, they were closing schools and raising taxes."
00:57:23.732,00:57:27.278,These people are not out to change the world.
00:57:27.319,00:57:35.619,And this is not some quaint academic discovery stuck in the back of an obscure medical journal.
00:57:35.660,00:57:47.423,"Bennet Omalu is going to war with a corporation that has 20 million people, on a weekly basis, craving their product, the same way they crave food."
00:57:48.673,00:57:52.261,The NFL owns a day of the week.
00:57:52.303,00:57:55.139,The same day the church used to own.
00:57:55.180,00:57:57.266,Now it's theirs.
00:57:57.308,00:57:58.976,They're very big.
00:58:13.490,00:58:14.866,Terry Long.
00:58:17.202,00:58:20.456,The tests came back positive.
00:58:20.497,00:58:30.257,"Football gave him CTE, and CTE told his brain to drink a gallon of antifreeze, and he died."
00:58:31.549,00:58:33.302,I told you there would be more.
00:58:34.928,00:58:37.264,You have done great work.
00:58:37.306,00:58:40.058,No one would blame you if you stopped now.
00:58:40.100,00:58:42.311,"Oh, no one is stopping anything."
00:58:44.104,00:58:48.442,Then I'd be lying if I didn't tell you how important your next move is.
00:58:56.408,00:59:04.041,"By the time Terry Long committed suicide, his brain had been consumed by chronic traumatic encephalopathy."
00:59:04.082,00:59:12.632,"And it is probable, perhaps even likely, that a larger percentage of professional football players have and will die from CTE."
00:59:12.674,00:59:20.057,"Pittsburgh Medical Examiner's own Dr. Bennet Omalu, who today threw down the gauntlet at the feet of the National Football League."
00:59:20.098,00:59:21.517,Thank you.
00:59:24.895,00:59:26.188,What do you think?
00:59:26.230,00:59:28.232,I think you're gonna be an American hero.
00:59:29.774,00:59:31.276,I'm not even an American.
00:59:31.318,00:59:32.569,That's even better.
00:59:32.610,00:59:34.279,That's so fucking American.
00:59:38.825,00:59:51.671,"who is also vice-chairman of the neurosurgery department at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said of Omalu's CTE diagnosis that it was fallacious reasoning."
01:00:00.138,01:00:01.598,Yes.
01:00:01.639,01:00:03.434,"Yeah, is this Bennet Omalu?"
01:00:03.475,01:00:05.310,Dr. Bennet Omalu.
01:00:05.352,01:00:08.939,pussify this country?
01:00:08.980,01:00:12.317,Get the hell out.
01:01:09.625,01:01:11.335,Yes.
01:01:11.376,01:01:13.128,I took you to be an early riser.
01:01:13.170,01:01:15.005,I didn't want to call you at your office.
01:01:15.046,01:01:17.257,This is Julian Bailes.
01:01:18.467,01:01:19.926,Do you know who I am?
01:01:19.968,01:01:21.761,I know who you are.
01:01:23.096,01:01:24.889,Mike Webster was a personal friend.
01:01:26.808,01:01:27.976,Was he?
01:01:28.018,01:01:29.227,Dr. Omalu.
01:01:30.562,01:01:34.191,"You're in trouble, but you're not wrong."
01:01:34.232,01:01:36.109,I'd like to talk with you.
01:02:06.598,01:02:10.227,The NFL has known about this concussion crisis for years.
01:02:10.268,01:02:15.649,And what you have there is the research that forms the basis for the League's concussion guidelines.
01:02:16.274,01:02:21.988,"In this study, some academics put helmets on monkeys and shook them real hard."
01:02:22.030,01:02:26.618,They threw dogs and pigs and human cadavers down elevator shafts.
01:02:26.660,01:02:29.996,Helmets on crash-test dummies and bashed them together.
01:02:30.038,01:02:31.540,And their conclusion?
01:02:34.751,01:02:38.714,No striking player experienced neck injury or concussion.
01:02:38.755,01:02:42.759,"So, a concussion's no more dangerous than a hangnail."
01:02:42.800,01:02:44.969,-And that was it?
01:02:45.011,01:02:47.764,The NFL did what every organization does.
01:02:47.805,01:02:50.517,They put together a commission to study the study.
01:02:50.559,01:02:54.104,Dr. Elliot Pellman's Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee.
01:02:54.145,01:02:56.022,You know who else was on that committee?
01:02:56.064,01:02:58.275,-Dr. Maroon.
01:02:58.316,01:03:07.618,"Plus a couple of other team doctors, an equipment manager and two trainers, guys who tape knees for a living."
01:03:21.839,01:03:23.717,"Why am I here, Dr. Bailes?"
01:03:25.009,01:03:27.845,"Doctor, I'm not with the Steelers anymore."
01:03:29.264,01:03:32.476,I'm not with the NFL.
01:03:32.517,01:03:40.275,"Now, do you know how many Pittsburgh Steelers, just Steelers, now, have died in the last few years?"
01:03:40.317,01:03:42.026,And I'm not talking about the older guys.
01:03:42.068,01:03:45.530,"I'm talking about men that I worked with, and just the ones that I know about."
01:03:46.948,01:03:48.199,Twelve.
01:03:50.410,01:03:56.458,And I don't want to see any more of these men vanish in the back of a pickup truck.
01:04:08.386,01:04:09.805,I know them.
01:04:10.681,01:04:12.766,I was them.
01:04:12.808,01:04:14.726,And I think you're doing this wrong.
01:04:14.768,01:04:18.605,"As long as the NFL continues to deny the truth, nothing changes."
01:04:18.647,01:04:21.065,It's only true if they say it's true.
01:04:21.107,01:04:23.568,And they've got to say it out loud.
01:04:23.610,01:04:25.862,Get me a meeting with the Commissioner.
01:04:25.903,01:04:29.449,"I want to sit with him, man to man, face to face. I will make him say it out loud."
01:04:30.742,01:04:33.328,They don't want to talk to you.
01:04:33.370,01:04:36.956,Football does not want to talk to you.
01:04:36.998,01:04:44.130,"Like my daddy, a Louisiana judge, always used to say to me, Son, God is number one and football is number two."
01:04:46.424,01:04:48.802,"Besides, to them you're not even American."
01:04:48.844,01:04:51.095,You're not even African-American.
01:04:51.722,01:04:52.972,You're...
01:04:54.932,01:04:56.226,A doctor?
01:05:01.022,01:05:02.148,Okay.
01:05:03.983,01:05:05.402,Look.
01:05:05.443,01:05:08.238,The League has kept everyone in the dark.
01:05:08.279,01:05:12.659,And you turned on the lights and gave their biggest boogeyman a name.
01:05:12.701,01:05:17.121,"What's happening now, what you think they're doing to you, that's nothing."
01:05:19.207,01:05:24.629,I've done my own research on this NFL Brain Injury Committee.
01:05:24.671,01:05:27.674,You know what Dr. Elliot Pellman is?
01:05:27.716,01:05:29.217,He's a rheumatologist.
01:05:29.259,01:05:32.429,He's a specialist in arthritis and joint pain.
01:05:32.470,01:05:38.602,Can you tell me what a rheumatologist knows about the brain and brain disease?
01:05:38.643,01:05:43.356,"Corporate men like this, in this country, usually go to Harvard or Yale."
01:05:44.608,01:05:47.318,He went to medical school in Guadalajara.
01:05:48.820,01:05:50.405,-Mexico?
01:05:54.576,01:05:55.952,That's beautiful.
01:06:00.498,01:06:04.961,"Now, two cases does not meet the scientific burden of proof."
01:06:05.002,01:06:06.463,You have to keep going.
01:06:08.172,01:06:12.969,"Just so you understand, this does not show up on a CT scan."
01:06:13.010,01:06:16.139,Which means there's no diagnosis before death.
01:06:16.180,01:06:19.976,"In order for me to keep going, more have to die."
01:06:20.017,01:06:22.854,"Unfortunately, that's already happening."
01:07:07.649,01:07:09.400,Did I hear right?
01:07:09.442,01:07:11.653,-Tapping you for mayor of Chicago?
01:07:11.695,01:07:13.571,"Still a long, long road, my friend."
01:07:13.613,01:07:18.368,"All-world killer athlete to civilian to king, all in one lifetime."
01:07:18.409,01:07:22.163,"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Mayor Dave Duerson..."
01:07:22.205,01:07:24.666,-...who has figured it out.
01:07:29.086,01:07:30.296,-Dave!
01:07:30.338,01:07:32.465,"It's me, man. Andre Waters."
01:07:32.507,01:07:34.300,"How you doing, man?"
01:07:34.342,01:07:37.345,"Look, let me walk with you."
01:07:37.387,01:07:40.348,"This is not good, Dave, not good."
01:07:40.390,01:07:43.727,"But, um, why is the committee doing this, man?"
01:07:43.768,01:07:46.145,There are five other trustees.
01:07:46.187,01:07:47.480,"You're the only one who played, man."
01:07:47.522,01:07:49.649,You the only one who knows what it is to be us.
01:07:49.691,01:07:52.903,"Hey, hey, hey. You and me, we were the same, man, huh?"
01:07:52.944,01:07:54.612,"We were bangers, hitmen."
01:07:54.654,01:07:56.698,File the appeal.
01:07:56.740,01:08:00.368,"You denied the appeal, Dave!"
01:08:00.410,01:08:01.745,I can't sleep. Okay...
01:08:01.786,01:08:03.997,"I mean, my eyes get crossed."
01:08:04.039,01:08:06.207,"-Hey, hey! Look at me!"
01:08:06.249,01:08:08.292,Look. Twelve years I paid my dues.
01:08:08.334,01:08:10.211,I made millions for those assholes.
01:08:10.253,01:08:12.672,"I mean, come on."
01:08:12.714,01:08:15.383,I'm just asking back what I gave!
01:08:15.425,01:08:19.136,Listen. Fat?
01:08:19.178,01:08:22.682,I've seen 20 doctors!
01:08:22.724,01:08:25.309,Get your shit together!
01:08:25.351,01:08:27.186,You used to be a warrior.
01:08:27.228,01:08:29.856,-You fucking sellout.
01:08:29.898,01:08:32.233,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Dave."
01:08:32.275,01:08:33.777,"Look, hey, hey, hey."
01:08:33.818,01:08:36.947,Remember when we were kids?
01:08:36.988,01:08:39.866,Playing's what we lived for.
01:08:39.908,01:08:42.827,"I need your help, Dave."
01:08:46.831,01:08:48.374,"Dave, help me!"
01:08:59.636,01:09:08.853,"Andre Waters, known as 'Dirty Waters,' notorious for his aggressive style of play and devastating hits that filled highlight reels."
01:09:08.895,01:09:12.983,Waters died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
01:09:13.024,01:09:14.525,He was 44.
01:09:19.363,01:09:26.537,"And, uh, this is the part where he, uh, got knocked out."
01:09:26.579,01:09:29.791,Andre Waters has it.
01:09:29.833,01:09:31.960,He said he was all right.
01:09:32.002,01:09:35.839,"Said he was just a little dazed, but he said he was all right."
01:09:39.175,01:09:40.677,You look well.
01:09:42.720,01:09:43.972,How are the kids?
01:09:44.014,01:09:45.140,Kids are fine.
01:09:46.557,01:09:47.851,I'm fine.
01:09:51.021,01:09:53.356,I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the funeral.
01:09:55.232,01:09:57.276,No one made it to the funeral.
01:09:58.778,01:10:00.989,He was the sun.
01:10:01.031,01:10:04.492,We was the planets.
01:10:04.534,01:10:16.379,"And then, after he gave me this card, he said, Ma, I'm ready to go."
01:10:16.420,01:10:19.674,Because he knew people was thinking he was crazy.
01:10:21.217,01:10:23.761,Not crazy.
01:10:23.803,01:10:27.015,become someone else.
01:10:27.057,01:10:31.227,You definitely think he had this disease?
01:10:31.268,01:10:34.189,Because I want to believe that.
01:10:34.230,01:10:35.899,"I believe so, yes."
01:10:37.400,01:10:41.404,And now you want what's left of my boy.
01:10:44.074,01:10:45.575,You heard about Mike Webster?
01:10:48.786,01:10:50.955,And Terry Long and...
01:10:51.622,01:10:52.916,And...
01:10:52.957,01:10:54.458,And who else?
01:10:58.796,01:11:01.632,"What do you really want to ask me, Julian?"
01:11:29.786,01:11:32.789,"Dr. Cyril Wecht, Dr. Julian Bailes."
01:11:34.373,01:11:35.959,-Pleasure to meet you.
01:11:41.839,01:11:43.340,Andre Waters.
01:11:52.349,01:11:54.018,Justin Strzelczyk.
01:12:07.073,01:12:09.617,I just kept sending them back out there.
01:12:09.659,01:12:12.036,were you thinking?
01:12:12.996,01:12:14.664,You've got to be a part of it.
01:12:14.705,01:12:19.335,You've got to be on the sidelines with them to understand.
01:12:19.376,01:12:23.631,"Whatever it takes to keep them in the game, to keep the whole thing going."
01:12:23.673,01:12:31.264,"Tape, needles, Vicodin, Toradol, Lidocaine, Percocet, Lexapro, Zoloft."
01:12:33.349,01:12:35.643,-Have I left anything out?
01:12:35.685,01:12:37.854,It's tires and oil.
01:12:37.895,01:12:40.523,Just mechanics trying to keep the cars on the racetrack.
01:12:40.564,01:12:44.068,"Yeah, well, it's not medicine."
01:12:45.069,01:12:46.570,It's business.
01:12:48.072,01:12:49.324,Oh.
01:12:49.365,01:12:51.534,-There you go.
01:12:51.575,01:12:55.872,Three cases is the scientific burden of evidence.
01:12:55.913,01:12:57.373,We have four.
01:12:57.414,01:13:00.751,That is far beyond anything the NFL can or cannot deny.
01:13:00.793,01:13:02.837,This is bigger than they are.
01:13:03.921,01:13:06.549,They have to listen to us now.
01:13:24.483,01:13:26.236,-Dr. Maroon.
01:13:26.277,01:13:28.779,-Would you like a drink?
01:13:28.821,01:13:30.865,He doesn't want a drink.
01:13:30.907,01:13:34.244,Your conclusions totally misrepresent the facts.
01:13:34.285,01:13:38.373,To say that Webster and Long and Waters were killed by football is...
01:13:38.414,01:13:41.042,Is fallacious reasoning.
01:13:41.084,01:13:42.459,"Yes, I know."
01:13:44.087,01:13:46.422,Where's he going with this?
01:13:46.463,01:13:49.050,Just hear him out.
01:13:49.092,01:13:56.807,"I would like to propose a formal, controlled study of former and current NFL football players."
01:13:56.849,01:14:01.896,We will bring together the greatest minds in America to solve the problem.
01:14:01.938,01:14:03.273,We should be working together.
01:14:05.191,01:14:08.027,Who do you think you're talking to?
01:14:09.445,01:14:11.072,Excuse me?
01:14:11.114,01:14:14.117,I was the President of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.
01:14:14.158,01:14:19.997,"And I was the man who performed the autopsies on Mike Webster, Terry Long."
01:14:21.124,01:14:22.458,Your men.
01:14:23.500,01:14:25.378,Men under your care.
01:14:28.089,01:14:30.883,Do you know what Mike Webster's wife said?
01:14:30.925,01:14:39.683,"She said that if she had known that Mike was sick, she would have done more for him."
01:14:42.312,01:14:45.856,But he died in disgrace.
01:14:47.150,01:14:48.192,Your man.
01:14:50.320,01:14:52.363,Your man.
01:14:52.405,01:14:54.073,You took an oath.
01:14:55.032,01:14:56.951,-Tell the truth.
01:14:56.993,01:15:00.121,-Tell the truth!
01:14:56.993,01:15:04.417,"-The truth is that the NFL is a blessing and a salvation, my friend."
01:15:05.668,01:15:08.921,We employ hundreds of thousands of people.
01:15:08.963,01:15:13.050,We send thousands and thousands of poor kids to school.
01:15:13.092,01:15:19.723,The ownership of this football club has donated millions of dollars to countless charities.
01:15:19.765,01:15:21.058,Do you want me to go on?
01:15:21.100,01:15:22.518,That won't be necessary.
01:15:22.559,01:15:24.520,"Oh, it is necessary."
01:15:24.561,01:15:33.363,Football is the most popular sport in America because it is so goddamn fantastic!
01:15:35.906,01:15:37.825,"And that, right there?"
01:15:39.369,01:15:43.622,That is the beating heart of this city.
01:15:43.664,01:15:46.042,"And you want to, what, end it?"
01:15:46.083,01:15:49.420,You want to fold up the National Football League?
01:15:50.546,01:15:52.798,I want to solve the problem.
01:15:52.840,01:15:54.675,Who are you?
01:15:54.717,01:15:55.885,What are you asking?
01:15:55.926,01:15:57.887,You're a pathologist.
01:15:57.928,01:15:59.763,You perform autopsies.
01:15:59.805,01:16:01.516,"Yes, I am a mere pathologist."
01:16:01.557,01:16:03.642,That's it. That's all I am.
01:16:10.983,01:16:14.695,Do you have any idea of the impact of what you're doing?
01:16:14.737,01:16:15.779,"Yes, I do."
01:16:15.821,01:16:19.367,Do you understand the impact of what you are doing?
01:16:19.409,01:16:29.419,"If just 10% of the mothers in America decide that football is too dangerous for their sons to play, that is it."
01:16:29.460,01:16:35.049,"Kids, colleges, and eventually, it's just a matter of time, the professional game."
01:16:35.091,01:16:38.761,"Joe, he does autopsies."
01:16:38.802,01:16:40.763,He has no business.
01:16:40.804,01:16:49.230,"Do you know what history does to people, trained physicians, -who ignore science?"
01:16:49.272,01:16:51.441,"Sir, I am not done!"
01:16:51.482,01:16:53.109,History laughs.
01:16:54.818,01:17:00.116,"If you continue to deny my work, the world will deny my work."
01:17:01.992,01:17:10.834,"But men, your men, continue to die, their families left in ruins."
01:17:14.713,01:17:16.299,Tell the truth.
01:17:18.342,01:17:19.885,Tell the truth.
01:17:31.314,01:17:35.151,You sure...
01:17:35.192,01:17:38.404,"I would ask you that same question, Dr. Maroon."
01:17:42.699,01:17:45.869,"Oh, your study, I'll get back to you."
01:17:59.008,01:18:00.801,"Well, that went well."
01:18:41.258,01:18:54.647,"When I was a boy growing up in Nigeria, heaven was here and America was here."
01:18:57.608,01:19:01.820,"To me, it was the place where God sent all of His favorite people."
01:19:04.281,01:19:07.243,"You could be anything, you could do anything."
01:19:09.245,01:19:14.041,Americans were the manifestation of what God wanted us all to be.
01:19:18.921,01:19:26.637,I have never wanted anything as much as I wanted to be accepted as an American.
01:19:32.685,01:19:37.690,But Mike Webster goes mad and nobody asks why.
01:19:40.150,01:19:42.278,They make fun of him.
01:19:42.319,01:19:44.321,They insult him on TV.
01:19:44.363,01:19:47.742,And now they want to pretend that his disease does not exist.
01:19:47.783,01:19:50.160,And they want to bury me.
01:19:53.623,01:19:55.207,It's offensive.
01:19:57.334,01:19:59.462,I am offended.
01:20:04.841,01:20:07.928,I am the wrong person to have discovered this.
01:20:12.808,01:20:16.186,There is no coincidence in this world.
01:20:18.939,01:20:39.168,"Tell me, what is the statistical probability that you, not just a doctor, but Bennet Omalu, came to America, ended up here in this rusty place for you alone to be the one to see this?"
01:20:46.509,01:20:52.055,"When I arrived in New York, I was attacked."
01:20:52.848,01:20:54.224,What happened?
01:20:54.266,01:20:56.935,Something that is better left unsaid.
01:20:59.021,01:21:02.566,But that man almost broke me.
01:21:04.694,01:21:08.364,I wanted to give up and go back.
01:21:12.242,01:21:14.244,But I knew God.
01:21:15.912,01:21:21.210,I decided to trust His wisdom and I stayed.
01:21:23.920,01:21:31.887,"And now I am looking at this man, an Omalu Onyemalukwube."
01:21:31.928,01:21:39.269,"Your name, it means, If you know, you must come forth and speak."
01:21:41.605,01:21:43.524,How did you know that?
01:21:43.566,01:21:45.359,I called your father.
01:21:45.401,01:21:47.277,He was pleased to hear from me.
01:21:47.319,01:21:50.072,"Yes, I am sure he was."
01:21:50.113,01:21:53.409,"If you don't speak for the dead, who will?"
01:21:55.578,01:21:58.706,"You are of the Igbo tribe, Bennet."
01:21:58.748,01:22:05.087,"When you have truth, the thing you are told you cannot do is the thing you must do."
01:22:05.128,01:22:10.967,Embrace that and nothing created by man can bring you down.
01:22:17.808,01:22:20.603,to the press now.
01:22:21.771,01:22:39.037,"After examining the remains of former National Football League player Andre Waters, a neuropathologist in Pittsburgh, Dr. Bennet Omalu, is claiming that Mr. Waters had sustained brain damage from playing football, and he says that led to his depression and ultimate death."
01:22:40.122,01:22:42.583,It gets worse.
01:22:42.625,01:22:56.931,"Dr. Julian Bailes, medical director for the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes and the chairman of the Department of Neurosurgery of West Virginia University said, 'Unfortunately, I'm not shocked.' There's more Omalu and more Bailes."
01:22:56.972,01:22:59.558,Bailes.
01:22:59.600,01:23:03.145,Steelers team doctor.
01:23:06.064,01:23:08.317,-Wow.
01:23:08.358,01:23:11.320,The Times is calling it a potential epidemic.
01:23:11.821,01:23:12.822,Paul.
01:23:14.197,01:23:16.826,"It's not the Sports section, not Science."
01:23:17.993,01:23:22.331,"It's A-1, front page New York Times."
01:23:26.126,01:23:30.756,"Apparently, the Commissioner has been yearning for years to go back to his litigator roots."
01:23:30.798,01:23:37.137,announced that he would retire in July after nearly 17 years.
01:23:37.179,01:23:42.184,the most lucrative and stabilizing reign perhaps in the history.
01:23:42.225,01:23:45.020,"At the NFL owners meeting in Illinois, Roger Goodell..."
01:23:45.061,01:23:48.106,There's a new sheriff in town.
01:23:48.148,01:23:50.734,Each day seems to bring a fresh round of tributes.
01:23:50.776,01:23:53.487,What I'm here to do now is protect the shield.
01:23:53.529,01:23:56.365,The NFL isn't just a sports league.
01:23:57.240,01:23:58.742,It's an entertainment product.
01:23:58.784,01:24:00.911,-America's game.
01:24:00.953,01:24:03.246,I want us to go on enjoying our great game...
01:24:03.288,01:24:04.331,Allegheny County Coroner.
01:24:04.915,01:24:06.583,"Sure, one second."
01:24:07.877,01:24:10.212,-It's Dr. Julian Bailes.
01:24:10.253,01:24:11.714,Here he is.
01:24:13.340,01:24:14.299,Julian.
01:24:14.341,01:24:15.801,"Hey, turn on the TV."
01:24:15.843,01:24:17.594,"Yes, I'm watching."
01:24:17.636,01:24:21.056,You asked for a face-to-face with the Commissioner?
01:24:21.097,01:24:25.394,Goodell and the NFL are asking for a concussion summit.
01:24:25.435,01:24:29.064,A full presentation in Chicago next week.
01:24:30.106,01:24:32.026,They heard you.
01:24:32.067,01:24:33.861,-You have your shot.
01:24:35.445,01:24:36.655,Julian.
01:24:51.127,01:24:53.589,Why don't you throw in some football stuff?
01:24:53.630,01:24:55.758,Some non-medical terms?
01:24:55.799,01:24:57.927,Things we'd say.
01:24:57.968,01:25:00.679,Why do I need to say things they'd say?
01:25:01.931,01:25:04.474,I thought I was here for the other reason.
01:25:05.684,01:25:08.103,"You have what, seven, eight degrees?"
01:25:08.144,01:25:12.107,You're one of the smartest people they'll ever meet.
01:25:13.483,01:25:15.569,You know what?
01:25:15.611,01:25:17.237,You're gonna be fine.
01:25:26.789,01:25:28.290,How about you?
01:25:30.250,01:25:31.752,How will you be?
01:25:36.172,01:25:42.805,"You know, it is a mindless, violent game and then it's Shakespeare."
01:25:42.846,01:25:44.890,"I mean, to me it's like life that way."
01:25:44.932,01:25:52.439,"And I know you can't see how exciting and beautiful all that is, and I don't blame you."
01:25:53.983,01:25:59.071,But what I'm trying to tell you is this is not fun for me.
01:26:00.864,01:26:04.242,"All of the people we're going to see tomorrow, I know them personally."
01:26:04.284,01:26:10.373,And that feeling you have when someone you love and admire screws you over?
01:26:13.543,01:26:16.046,They're going to have that feeling.
01:26:18.340,01:26:19.842,Because of me.
01:26:21.217,01:26:24.013,And there is not a damn thing I can do about it.
01:26:44.574,01:26:45.659,Hey.
01:26:45.701,01:26:47.410,We have to talk.
01:26:47.452,01:26:48.745,What's wrong?
01:26:51.456,01:26:55.085,"There's no easy way to say this, so I'm just going to say it."
01:26:55.127,01:26:56.879,They're not gonna let you speak.
01:26:58.547,01:27:00.423,What?
01:27:00.465,01:27:02.676,They don't even want you in the room.
01:27:05.387,01:27:06.680,They want me to do it.
01:27:09.391,01:27:11.601,-One of their own.
01:27:11.643,01:27:12.895,"So, they want to pretend..."
01:27:12.936,01:27:14.771,"That you don't even exist, that's right."
01:27:14.813,01:27:16.648,Okay. Yeah.
01:27:16.690,01:27:19.442,-They still have to sit and listen.
01:27:19.484,01:27:21.778,Yes. You blew up their whole world.
01:27:21.820,01:27:23.363,"And yours, Julian."
01:27:23.405,01:27:25.281,Yes. Mine.
01:27:25.323,01:27:34.416,Because how can it be possible that some African voodoo doctor could understand this subject better than them?
01:27:35.417,01:27:38.378,Or even better than you?
01:27:38.420,01:27:41.631,Wait a second.
01:27:41.673,01:27:44.801,I'm not here because of you.
01:27:44.843,01:27:46.887,You are here for redemption.
01:27:46.929,01:27:49.932,You are here to use me to cleanse your sins.
01:27:51.934,01:27:54.978,You self-righteous bastard.
01:27:55.020,01:28:03.528,"Do you have any idea what I could have, how much I could have if I went back to my side of the ball and just kept my mouth shut?"
01:28:05.447,01:28:09.534,"Everything in my world is telling me not to agree with you, except one."
01:28:10.160,01:28:11.661,Science.
01:28:12.370,01:28:14.748,"So, here I am."
01:28:14.790,01:28:19.253,"Up here, beside you."
01:28:21.046,01:28:24.382,What more can I do to prove myself to you?
01:28:53.662,01:28:55.205,I am sorry.
01:28:57.499,01:28:59.417,"Convince them, Julian."
01:29:16.310,01:29:18.937,"You know, my father can't remember a goddamn thing."
01:29:18.979,01:29:20.981,He never played a day of football.
01:29:21.023,01:29:23.650,"He was too busy working in a factory, you quack!"
01:29:24.318,01:29:25.902,I beg your pardon?
01:29:25.944,01:29:28.905,"You take your bullshit science, go back to Africa."
01:29:28.947,01:29:30.324,And get away from our game!
01:29:34.036,01:29:35.787,What happened?
01:29:35.829,01:29:41.084,Roger Goodell just said that Justin Strzelczyk may have gotten his concussion swimming.
01:29:41.793,01:29:43.337,In a swimming pool.
01:29:43.377,01:29:44.754,That's insanity.
01:29:44.796,01:29:46.756,This whole thing was staged.
01:29:46.798,01:29:49.801,They needed to say that they heard us so they could goddamn bury us.
01:29:49.843,01:29:52.262,The science means nothing to them.
01:29:52.304,01:29:55.640,This is an important day in the National Football League.
01:29:55.682,01:30:02.105,We've had some very good dialogue which will help us improve the care for our players.
01:30:02.147,01:30:10.530,when you hear about former NFL players suffering from symptoms that has only been seen in boxers and people at over 80 years old?
01:30:10.572,01:30:13.700,"I mean, what does that say about the effect of concussions on players?"
01:30:13.742,01:30:18.705,"I'm not a doctor here, but you have to look at their entire medical history."
01:30:18.747,01:30:21.875,This is an evolving science.
01:30:21.917,01:30:29.299,"While I agree with the Commissioner, no empirically determined proof was presented today."
01:30:29.341,01:30:32.302,Because there simply isn't any.
01:30:32.344,01:30:43.063,"Because according to the NFL's own numbers, half of all players with concussions are sent back into the same game, including some who were actually knocked out cold."
01:30:44.438,01:30:53.990,Ira Casson was head of the team of NFL doctors who had looked into the issue and determined that the concern over head injuries was overblown.
01:30:54.032,01:31:02.332,"Is there any evidence, as far as you're concerned, that links multiple head injuries among pro football players with depression?"
01:31:02.374,01:31:03.457,No.
01:31:05.085,01:31:06.336,No.
01:31:06.378,01:31:08.671,onset of Alzheimer's?
01:31:08.713,01:31:09.965,No.
01:31:10.006,01:31:17.722,Is there any evidence as of today that links multiple head injuries with any long-term problem like that?
01:31:17.764,01:31:19.641,-In NFL players? No.
01:31:47.836,01:31:49.587,"Hey, little one."
01:31:51.505,01:31:53.342,This is your father.
01:31:57.262,01:31:59.597,I am in deep shit.
01:32:04.019,01:32:10.859,"I have not done anything wrong, but I am being punished."
01:32:17.282,01:32:21.203,It might not be so nice when you get out here.
01:32:25.207,01:32:27.501,You are still with God.
01:32:29.794,01:32:32.546,Please ask Him to help me.
01:33:04.120,01:33:06.206,It's all right. It's okay.
01:33:13.046,01:33:16.091,-What is this?
01:33:16.132,01:33:18.760,"Apparently, I'm being relieved of my duties."
01:33:18.801,01:33:20.512,What? I don't understand.
01:33:20.554,01:33:24.182,"has been indicted on 84 federal counts, including..."
01:33:24.224,01:33:27.769,"Please, please, Tex."
01:33:27.810,01:33:41.533,"I'm being indicted on 84 federal counts, including mail fraud, wire fraud, other related offenses, arising out of my use of government resources to advance my private practice."
01:33:41.575,01:33:51.293,"Including, but not limited to, uh, mileage vouchers, misuse of office stationery and my personal use of the fax machine."
01:33:53.503,01:33:55.130,-Faxes?
01:33:55.171,01:33:57.591,They could not come up with something this stupid in Nigeria.
01:33:58.967,01:34:01.511,This man has been a public servant for decades.
01:34:03.805,01:34:05.432,Cyril.
01:34:05.474,01:34:08.935,Have you ever performed any private services on county time?
01:34:08.977,01:34:10.812,-Have I?
01:34:10.853,01:34:13.856,"Apparently, we've both hurt the government's feelings."
01:34:15.733,01:34:19.237,Are you referring to the death row case where I used my personal time?
01:34:19.279,01:34:22.282,"We don't want you, Dr. Omalu, but we can have you."
01:34:23.074,01:34:24.451,And what does that mean?
01:34:24.493,01:34:26.161,That means they want your testimony.
01:34:28.913,01:34:30.748,-Against you?
01:34:32.208,01:34:33.835,I... I understand.
01:34:34.961,01:34:38.256,You are attacking him to get to me.
01:34:38.881,01:34:40.842,I know.
01:34:40.883,01:34:44.137,This is because his name is on my research.
01:34:44.179,01:34:45.597,What research is that?
01:34:47.474,01:34:49.392,No. I will resign first.
01:34:49.434,01:34:54.939,"In which case, your immigration status will be revised since your status requires full-time employment."
01:34:56.316,01:34:59.277,Then I will get another job in another city.
01:35:00.778,01:35:02.531,That would be fine.
01:35:24.594,01:35:29.224,"All I asked is that if you did this, we both came out okay."
01:35:29.265,01:35:30.892,Not professional ruination.
01:35:34.688,01:35:36.356,Whoever...
01:35:36.398,01:35:44.155,"Whatever takes over for me, they're going to want the CTE information, you know that."
01:35:45.699,01:35:47.867,What if they show up here with a warrant?
01:35:47.909,01:35:50.203,On suspicion of what?
01:35:50.245,01:35:54.123,"Ah, suspicion of bullshit."
01:35:54.165,01:35:56.042,You didn't deserve it.
01:35:57.126,01:36:00.088,You know the worst part?
01:36:00.129,01:36:04.593,"Cyril, they are not going to make me say one word against you."
01:36:05.594,01:36:07.596,What are you gonna say?
01:36:07.637,01:36:10.306,Cyril Wecht's a loudmouth asshole?
01:36:11.391,01:36:13.685,I don't care. I'm tired.
01:36:14.310,01:36:15.895,My balls are low.
01:36:23.361,01:36:25.655,I didn't do good enough by you.
01:36:28.241,01:36:29.451,"Cyril, um..."
01:36:31.785,01:36:34.080,I cannot go back to Nigeria.
01:36:36.165,01:36:38.960,Everything that I am is here.
01:36:41.087,01:36:43.965,My child has got to be born in America.
01:36:46.468,01:36:47.969,Don't worry.
01:36:48.010,01:36:50.346,I'll get you a job.
01:36:50.388,01:36:53.182,"Hey, you can work with me in the prison laundry."
01:36:59.105,01:37:01.149,Call the surgeon.
01:37:01.190,01:37:02.984,We need a goddamn drink.
01:38:03.545,01:38:10.301,"All they have to do is put on the side of the helmet, The Surgeon General has determined that playing football is hazardous to your health."
01:38:10.343,01:38:12.345,You got to put it on both sides of the helmet.
01:38:25.650,01:38:27.485,that Paul Tagliabue...
01:38:27.527,01:38:32.281,"This is the former Commissioner Tagliabue, did you know that Paul was a partner in Covington and Burling?"
01:38:32.323,01:38:35.577,Which is the same law firm that represented the big seven tobacco companies.
01:38:35.618,01:38:37.203,Of course he was.
01:38:37.245,01:38:38.788,But now they're representing the National Football League.
01:38:38.830,01:38:40.498,Of course they do.
01:38:50.466,01:38:55.971,"with the Steelers, we moved a game from a Sunday to a Tuesday because of a blizzard."
01:38:56.013,01:39:01.811,And the League said that they weren't concerned about the ratings because the League was immune from acts of God.
01:39:26.294,01:39:27.295,Bennet!
01:39:55.239,01:39:57.032,There's no heartbeat.
01:40:00.994,01:40:03.706,"May we have the room, please?"
01:40:03.748,01:40:05.750,Excuse us. Thank you.
01:40:23.893,01:40:25.394,I'm so sorry.
01:40:26.479,01:40:29.691,I'm so sorry.
01:40:29.732,01:40:31.901,This is my fault.

01:41:03.683,01:41:06.352,I wish I had never met Mike Webster.
01:41:11.232,01:41:13.066,They destroyed us.
01:41:16.320,01:41:21.283,And I don't understand why it is happening this way.
01:41:25.287,01:41:27.248,"Bennet, listen to me."
01:41:30.125,01:41:33.462,Do you know what I chose to fake?
01:41:38.801,01:41:39.886,You.
01:41:46.392,01:41:48.394,We will have this family.
01:41:49.020,01:41:50.103,Yes.
01:41:50.980,01:41:52.356,We will.
01:41:55.568,01:41:57.194,Just not here.
01:42:00.782,01:42:02.617,We have to go.
01:42:43.825,01:42:45.367,Dr. Omalu.
01:42:45.409,01:42:48.161,I just need the measurements for the flat screens.
01:42:50.623,01:42:52.500,That won't be necessary.
01:45:28.906,01:45:31.492,"happened to you, Jose."
01:45:32.493,01:45:33.702,Tell me.
01:45:34.996,01:45:37.248,It's going to be okay.
01:45:46.924,01:45:48.592,Listen.
01:45:48.634,01:45:51.053,My mind keeps slipping.
01:45:51.095,01:45:54.182,I can't seem to find the goddamn words no more.
01:45:54.807,01:45:55.891,What?
01:46:00.353,01:46:01.897,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:46:04.608,01:46:06.819,I just can't do this.
01:46:06.861,01:46:08.361,And I'm sorry.
01:46:52.073,01:46:53.199,Yes.

01:47:10.758,01:47:13.510,-My God.
01:47:13.552,01:47:15.721,He wants his brain to be donated.
01:47:15.763,01:47:17.390,To be examined.
01:47:21.060,01:47:22.811,They said that we were right.
01:47:27.566,01:47:29.026,"Benny, you there?"
01:47:30.611,01:47:32.445,"Yes. Yes, I'm here."

01:48:13.321,01:48:15.656,I don't know what to say to them.
01:48:20.328,01:48:22.746,Tell them what's really happening.
01:49:12.671,01:49:13.839,Hello.
01:49:15.799,01:49:17.092,Um...
01:49:19.887,01:49:28.187,"A small boy, uh, came to me and said, Mister, why do you hate football?"
01:49:28.229,01:49:31.232,"I said, I don't hate football."
01:49:31.273,01:49:34.943,"He said, Yes, my father said you hate football."
01:49:34.985,01:49:36.987,"I said, You tell your father to come see me."

01:49:55.005,01:50:03.431,"But through her eyes, I can see the beauty and the grace, the power."
01:50:06.767,01:50:10.396,I said to her that I wished I'd never met Mike Webster.
01:50:22.575,01:50:24.910,But that was before I knew him.
01:50:28.663,01:50:33.001,He has given me a great gift.
01:50:36.297,01:50:38.132,A dangerous gift.

01:52:33.330,01:52:36.667,We're doing everything we possibly can for our players now.
01:52:36.709,01:52:40.045,a simple question.
01:52:40.087,01:52:52.182,"It sort of reminds me of the tobacco companies, pre-'90s, when they kept saying, No, there's no link between smoking and, um, damage to your health, or ill health effects."
01:52:52.224,01:52:58.313,And they were forced to admit that that was incorrect through a spate of litigation in the 1990s.
01:52:58.355,01:53:00.899,And my question to you is...
01:53:00.941,01:53:04.445,"Oh, we have heard from the NFL time and time again."

01:53:10.075,01:53:24.632,I want to know what are you doing in the negotiations that are going on now to deal with this problem and the other problems related to the injuries that football players obtain and its impact on their health?
01:53:25.340,01:53:27.092,You did all this.
01:53:27.134,01:53:39.104,"I know my time is drawing to a close, but let me just say this to Mr. Goodell, uh, and everybody who's here today that I think it's time for the Congress of the United States to take a look."
01:53:41.607,01:53:42.857,First time in Washington?
01:53:44.817,01:53:47.279,"Well, we're thrilled you accepted our invitation."
01:53:47.321,01:53:49.573,"I was, uh, very curious."
01:53:51.492,01:54:02.835,"Chief Medical Examiner for Washington, DC means you would also consult with the CIA and FBI and any foreign government requesting the assistance of the United States government."

01:54:06.340,01:54:09.677,Wouldn't have to put on scrubs or perform an autopsy.
01:54:10.678,01:54:12.763,You're beyond all that now.

01:54:20.270,01:54:22.063,No.
01:54:22.105,01:54:23.856,I'm sure it's fine.
01:54:30.698,01:54:35.160,"We know everything you did, Dr. Omalu."
01:54:35.202,01:54:39.498,You exemplify everything it is to be an American.
