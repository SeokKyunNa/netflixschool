00:00:40.166,00:00:42.250,"What's going on at Sutton Hoo, then?"
00:00:49.125,00:00:52.125,"-Ah, thank you kindly. Mind how you go. -Thank you."
00:01:39.541,00:01:42.166,"Mornin'. Mrs. Pretty, please."
00:01:43.291,00:01:44.250,Basil Brown.
00:01:45.208,00:01:46.083,Wait here.
00:02:13.375,00:02:16.500,Things like this are usually done through museums.
00:02:20.416,00:02:24.291,"Mr. Reid Moir said that, with the war coming, they couldn't embark upon any new ventures."
00:02:30.291,00:02:32.416,He told me you were a difficult man.
00:02:34.875,00:02:38.000,Unorthodox… and untrained.
00:02:42.958,00:02:46.083,I've been on dig since I was old enough to hold a trowel.
00:02:49.875,00:02:52.458,Perhaps Reid Moir just wants to keep you for himself.
00:03:08.208,00:03:10.041,with the hope of exploring what was under there.
00:03:20.750,00:03:23.458,"We're standing in someone's graveyard, I reckon."
00:03:24.875,00:03:29.208,Viking… or maybe older.
00:03:30.250,00:03:33.666,"Apparently, local girls used to lie down on them in the hope of falling pregnant."
00:03:34.708,00:03:37.083,I've heard plenty of legends.
00:03:38.041,00:03:40.208,"Is that why you want to dig, Mrs. Pretty?"
00:03:41.458,00:03:42.958,Tales of buried treasure?
00:03:45.750,00:03:50.250,"My interest in archaeology began like yours, when I was scarcely old enough to hold a trowel."
00:03:51.208,00:03:53.833,My childhood home was built on a Cistercian convent.
00:03:54.333,00:03:56.791,I helped my father excavate the apse.
00:03:58.458,00:03:59.916,"That speaks, don't it?"
00:04:01.625,00:04:02.541,The past.
00:04:05.500,00:04:07.458,"You have rabbits, Mrs. Pretty."
00:04:11.583,00:04:13.250,They're bad for excavations.
00:04:14.458,00:04:16.375,I'd like to start with this one.
00:04:18.708,00:04:20.250,not personally speaking.
00:04:25.666,00:04:28.041,And the soil feels-- That's compacted.
00:04:28.833,00:04:31.000,Thieves used to sink shafts in.
00:04:31.500,00:04:33.416,"Robber's flutes, they're called."
00:04:34.291,00:04:37.708,Anything they found would've been melted down and sold long ago.
00:04:38.583,00:04:42.166,I expect you might be better off with… one of these.
00:04:43.583,00:04:45.458,But I have a feeling about this one.
00:04:47.333,00:04:50.625,"but I'd base your dig on evidence, not feeling."
00:04:56.666,00:04:58.333,and 6 pence a week be acceptable?
00:04:58.833,00:05:06.291,"Oh… -That was his reply. -Well, he don't pay enough."
00:05:08.250,00:05:10.541,I'm afraid that's all I can reasonably afford to spend.
00:05:12.583,00:05:16.583,"Robert, where did you get that gas mask? Take it off."
00:05:17.291,00:05:19.833,"-Sorry, I didn't realize you were-- -This is not a toy."
00:05:19.916,00:05:21.375,"Robert, this is Mr. Brown."
00:05:25.416,00:05:26.333,Who's coming after you?
00:05:36.500,00:05:38.541,"I'm afraid not. Uh, not today."
00:05:40.625,00:05:41.500,Excuse me.
00:06:09.083,00:06:10.208,"Ah, blast."
00:06:26.291,00:06:27.541,-Mr. Brown? -Yes?
00:06:28.083,00:06:30.666,"Billy Lyons. Uh, uh, from Mrs. Pretty."
00:06:31.625,00:06:32.541,All right.
00:06:33.791,00:06:34.666,Hmm.
00:06:43.875,00:06:47.000,"Tell her Monday, 8:00 sharp."
00:06:51.166,00:06:54.125,"And it's too far to bike, if you want a day's digging."
00:06:57.000,00:07:00.416,"Mr. Lyons is my chauffeur, and Mrs. Lyons is in charge of the kitchen."
00:07:15.708,00:07:18.666,John Jacobs and Mr. Spooner are bringing the shepherd's hut.
00:07:19.708,00:07:21.958,I thought it might be useful in case of inclement weather.
00:07:22.041,00:07:23.958,"Oh, that's very considerate."
00:07:27.000,00:07:30.791,My son Robert is keen to assist you in any way.
00:07:30.875,00:07:34.583,"If you find his presence irksome-- Oh, no, no, no. He can come."
00:07:35.750,00:07:36.916,You'll start with this one?
00:07:40.958,00:07:44.291,"I reckon we can forget that larger mound, Mrs. Pretty."
00:07:44.875,00:07:48.083,"This one here, that's where we'll find something."
00:08:02.125,00:08:05.958,"If you ask me, the man should leave Mrs. Pretty's mounds well alone."
00:09:01.083,00:09:03.958,"Darling, please be gentle. You'll knock me down."
00:09:10.708,00:09:11.958,"Well, thank you for the message."
00:09:12.041,00:09:15.666,"Well, it looks like the kind of tray you get at a butcher's."
00:09:15.750,00:09:20.166,"And there's some blackness here, maybe indicating a fire was made."
00:09:20.250,00:09:21.458,Who are those men?
00:09:25.291,00:09:28.083,"He wanted to see how things were progressing, so I invited him."
00:09:28.166,00:09:32.208,"Mrs. Pretty, this is Guy Maynard, our new curator."
00:09:33.750,00:09:34.583,"Hello, Brown."
00:09:34.666,00:09:38.000,"Maynard. Can I borrow you, please, for this here corner?"
00:09:38.666,00:09:39.500,Jolly good.
00:09:48.791,00:09:50.333,Is that the sum of your labors?
00:10:18.125,00:10:19.291,War is looming.
00:10:19.375,00:10:23.083,All hands are on deck to excavate before hostilities begin.
00:10:23.166,00:10:26.125,"And so, we must ask you to return Mr. Brown."
00:10:28.208,00:10:30.333,I'd like him to finish what he's started.
00:10:34.166,00:10:35.166,north of Felixstowe.
00:10:35.250,00:10:41.083,"It's of far greater import, if… if you'll forgive me, than this… minor venture."
00:10:42.291,00:10:45.166,-Then the choice is Mr. Brown's. -Excuse me.
00:10:45.750,00:10:49.833,Time had altered that piece of wood to compacted sand.
00:10:50.583,00:10:52.583,I didn't guess its age correctly.
00:10:53.208,00:10:56.166,"I speculated Viking, but I think that's older."
00:10:57.333,00:10:59.583,"-Anglo-Saxon. -That's most unlikely, Brown."
00:10:59.666,00:11:05.875,"We should-- We need you back at the villa. That's what I'm here to say, and… and Mrs. Pretty has released you."
00:11:07.083,00:11:08.833,I have said it is your choice.
00:11:10.666,00:11:11.958,"Well, then I'll stay."
00:11:12.791,00:11:14.250,"Thank you kindly, ma'am."
00:11:16.791,00:11:17.625,Excuse me.
00:11:17.708,00:11:19.250,"Now, look here, Brown."
00:11:19.333,00:11:21.583,You've made your point. You can have two pounds a week.
00:11:21.666,00:11:28.500,"We'll give you a few days to finish off here, and then, as we're the only museum in the area, I'd carefully consider where your future lies."
00:11:32.041,00:11:32.875,Understood.
00:11:35.458,00:11:39.375,"For instance, what's the most important part of an archaeologist's body?"
00:11:42.291,00:11:43.250,His nose.
00:11:44.125,00:11:46.833,"If there's something there, he'll know it by the smell."
00:11:53.416,00:11:55.208,You're going to see your father this afternoon?
00:11:58.375,00:12:00.500,I… I'm afraid I'm needed here.
00:12:01.333,00:12:05.416,"-Um, please, may I get down? -If you're quite sure you've finished."
00:13:38.500,00:13:42.125,"on a hot day like this is unlikely to agree with anyone, Mrs. Lyons."
00:13:50.416,00:13:52.625,We've spoken on this subject before.
00:15:21.375,00:15:24.541,"Oh, you don't wanna be down there, Mrs. Pretty. That ain't safe."
00:15:25.041,00:15:27.083,Spooner and John Jacobs are making supports.
00:15:27.166,00:15:29.375,We can't continue without them now.
00:15:30.375,00:15:35.000,I was reading Howard Carter's account of his excavation of the tomb of Tutankhamun.
00:15:38.833,00:15:48.375,"He stood at the threshold of the burial chamber, the first man to do so for 3,000 years, and he saw finger marks still on the paint."
00:15:50.000,00:15:52.666,"He say, Time lost its meaning."
00:15:56.000,00:15:59.500,It occurs to me that you might unearth human remains.
00:16:07.875,00:16:09.250,"Disinterring them, in fact."
00:16:13.125,00:16:17.750,"The dead still get that courtesy, no matter how many centuries they've lain."
00:16:18.750,00:16:22.875,We can't dig down into the earth without considering that-- Oh!
00:16:38.500,00:16:39.875,Mr. Brown?
00:16:42.041,00:16:45.416,Spooner! Jacob! Get help!
00:17:31.958,00:17:32.875,"Come on, Basil!"
00:18:35.041,00:18:36.291,Mr. Brown!
00:18:47.583,00:18:48.791,Mr. Brown?
00:19:04.291,00:19:07.958,You're all right now. You're all right. You're all right.
00:19:10.500,00:19:13.250,"Into the library, Grateley. Lay him on the sofa."
00:19:41.041,00:19:42.166,When you were gone.
00:19:44.333,00:19:48.000,Oh… Something did come into my head.
00:19:48.875,00:19:49.875,What was it?
00:19:55.916,00:19:57.000,I have his name.
00:19:58.208,00:19:59.416,Basil Brown.
00:20:01.000,00:20:02.083,Farming man.
00:20:03.791,00:20:06.583,Taught me everything I know about Suffolk soil.
00:20:08.125,00:20:09.166,And you saw him?
00:20:22.000,00:20:24.250,"-Excuse me. -Mr. Brown, are you all right?"
00:20:26.291,00:20:27.916,"Mr. Brown, you have to rest!"
00:20:28.000,00:20:32.375,"See, Mrs. Pretty… this one is the one you like."
00:20:32.458,00:20:35.416,It's the one you wanted me to start on. It's oval.
00:20:35.916,00:20:37.375,Like a hog's back.
00:20:40.083,00:20:44.541,"-See? All the others, circular. -Yes."
00:20:44.625,00:20:47.083,"Now, this land's been plowed for 1,000 year."
00:20:48.416,00:20:54.166,"Now, supposing whoever plowed here… gradually knocked a bit off."
00:20:54.250,00:20:59.625,"So, by the time robbers come along, they'd have sunk the flute into what they thought was the center."
00:21:02.125,00:21:04.250,"East to west, that's my feeling."
00:21:11.625,00:21:13.333,…and I'll dig.
00:21:45.708,00:21:49.375,"And when I woke up, 500 years had passed."
00:21:53.333,00:21:57.083,"Well, the Earth is controlled by Killer Kane, who's an extremely evil man."
00:22:01.166,00:22:04.583,Did the people who made these burial mounds have mustaches?
00:22:06.416,00:22:08.458,They were a very beardy lot.
00:22:08.541,00:22:12.083,"Not like them there Romans. Now, they liked the close shave."
00:22:12.166,00:22:15.958,"The Vikings and the space pilots are the same, really, aren't they?"
00:22:16.458,00:22:19.791,They explore new lands and have battles in ships.
00:22:19.875,00:22:25.250,"Yeah, when you put it like that, I suppose they might be the same."
00:22:35.791,00:22:37.708,"Would you like to fly, Mr. Brown?"
00:22:39.625,00:22:43.833,"All over the cosmos, every time I look through my telescope."
00:22:44.583,00:22:45.958,You… You have a telescope?
00:22:49.708,00:22:51.375,"Well, will you show me?"
00:22:52.541,00:22:53.500,I might.
00:22:58.333,00:23:00.583,"Cor! He likes to natter, he does."
00:23:00.666,00:23:02.916,What was all that about space travel?
00:23:08.833,00:23:11.333,Came on his bike with a great parcel of them.
00:23:11.916,00:23:13.875,Sloan says some are in Norwegian.
00:23:14.375,00:23:15.916,Shall we try the green silk?
00:23:18.750,00:23:21.708,The velvet with the lace.
00:23:51.208,00:23:54.208,"Oh, much better, ma'am. Thank you for inquiring."
00:23:55.625,00:23:56.875,Would you like the wireless?
00:24:02.375,00:24:07.125,are now being asked to stand by for further training as RAF pilots or crew.
00:24:13.041,00:24:14.875,Then she married the colonel.
00:24:15.375,00:24:19.333,He first met with Edith when she was still at school.
00:24:19.416,00:24:22.916,"And on his 17th birthday, he asked her to marry him."
00:24:25.541,00:24:28.333,She say she can't possibly leave her father.
00:24:42.750,00:24:44.916,He been asking every year on her birthday.
00:24:51.208,00:24:52.958,her husband went and died too.
00:25:13.958,00:25:14.791,That's right.
00:25:45.000,00:25:49.916,"They found an iron rivet at the burial mound at Snape, didn't they?"
00:25:56.375,00:25:57.750,"My goodness, Basil."
00:26:04.625,00:26:07.500,"Mr. Spooner, will you bring my tape measure from the hut?"
00:26:07.583,00:26:09.666,One of you best get Mrs. Pretty down here.
00:26:19.166,00:26:22.083,"Right, boys. Here we go. Come on together."
00:26:22.166,00:26:24.541,Better have something to show Mrs. Pretty when she get back.
00:26:29.458,00:26:31.208,"No, no, no. Side door, please."
00:26:31.291,00:26:34.416,-Mrs. Pretty back from London yet? -Mrs. Pretty's about to dine.
00:26:46.541,00:26:48.541,I think you'd better come and see.
00:27:27.791,00:27:31.208,A warrior… or a king.
00:27:31.958,00:27:37.125,They must have pulled his ship all the way up that there hill from the river.
00:27:38.125,00:27:42.208,"Now, they'd have put it on ropes, and they'd have hauled it over logs."
00:27:47.166,00:27:50.500,I don't expect them to go to all this trouble for any little squirt.
00:27:51.208,00:27:54.208,Can you imagine the send-off they'd be giving him?
00:27:57.583,00:27:59.958,They'd have drunk Mr. Spooner under the table.
00:28:04.458,00:28:07.791,"Maynard disagrees, but I think it's Anglo-Saxon."
00:28:08.458,00:28:12.250,"Now, this is your doing, John Jacobs, 'cause you found the first rivet."
00:28:17.125,00:28:18.791,"Congratulations, Mr. Brown."
00:28:21.750,00:28:23.250,I had my feeling.
00:28:23.333,00:28:25.750,"That you did, Mrs. Pretty. That you did."
00:28:47.166,00:28:48.250,But who knows?
00:28:49.333,00:28:51.791,I'm pretty sure it continues further.
00:29:24.666,00:29:25.666,Evening.
00:29:39.166,00:29:41.125,It's going to change everything for Ipswich.
00:29:41.625,00:29:44.333,We'll be the envy of every museum in the country.
00:29:59.583,00:30:01.750,I turned his generous offer down.
00:30:07.166,00:30:10.375,"He said I couldn't keep it to myself, which is true."
00:30:12.791,00:30:15.791,"In the meantime, I've asked my cousin, Rory Lomax, to come."
00:30:18.916,00:30:21.541,"He's only an amateur, but then, so is Mr. Reid Moir."
00:30:23.750,00:30:26.583,"-Mrs. Pretty, you better go in the shed. -Oh, yes."
00:30:48.416,00:30:50.333,He can hardly wait to see you in the mornings.
00:30:53.500,00:30:54.625,Do you have children?
00:30:56.291,00:31:04.708,"No, uh, we, uh… No."
00:31:11.666,00:31:13.208,from Latin to geology.
00:31:20.666,00:31:27.500,"A guide to astronomical maps and charts, to make them accessible to ordinary men."
00:31:31.875,00:31:33.750,Always had a hunger to study.
00:31:41.750,00:31:43.458,My father wouldn't hear of it.
00:31:56.750,00:31:58.291,Would you have dinner with me?
00:32:00.250,00:32:03.583,Well… thank you. Yes.
00:32:27.250,00:32:29.875,"Surprise for you, Basil, in your room."
00:32:40.041,00:32:40.958,May.
00:32:42.500,00:32:44.625,I brought you some fresh shirts.
00:32:50.625,00:32:53.208,-Are you pleased to see me? -Of course I am.
00:32:59.416,00:33:00.583,I did tell you.
00:33:01.625,00:33:03.000,In my last letter.
00:33:10.166,00:33:12.750,Yes… I do.
00:33:21.375,00:33:23.708,-What's that? -I said there's nowhere to sit down.
00:33:26.250,00:33:28.166,You got something to show me? I think you have.
00:33:28.250,00:33:29.708,I can see it in your eyes.
00:33:29.791,00:33:31.208,I'm not saying anything.
00:33:38.166,00:33:41.416,"I suppose it's his wife. You know, she writes to him every day."
00:33:46.041,00:33:46.916,Come in.
00:33:50.583,00:33:53.291,"Mr. Brown sends his apologies, ma'am."
00:34:06.958,00:34:09.375,and not find anything like I've discovered here.
00:34:37.208,00:34:38.125,Innit?
00:34:43.000,00:34:44.916,I'll miss my lift back.
00:34:48.291,00:34:50.916,"Well, thanks for coming, May."
00:34:55.708,00:34:58.583,-I've been reading your books for company. -You haven't.
00:35:08.083,00:35:10.083,"Right. Well, it's good of you to bring my shirts."
00:35:12.666,00:35:13.541,All right.
00:35:38.458,00:35:39.708,Blast!
00:35:46.916,00:35:48.083,Ah!
00:36:07.333,00:36:10.916,"Right, then. Get around that side and take this tarp."
00:36:14.541,00:36:17.791,That's… That's right. That's right. There's a stake there behind you.
00:36:18.875,00:36:19.750,Pull it hard.
00:36:28.166,00:36:29.625,I'm Rory Lomax.
00:36:35.541,00:36:37.416,I'm Edith Pretty's cousin.
00:36:37.500,00:36:39.166,"She telephoned, asked me to come."
00:36:39.250,00:36:41.625,-Said you needed an extra pair of hands. -All right.
00:36:41.708,00:36:45.583,"I pointed out my general lack of skill, but she was undeterred."
00:36:46.708,00:36:51.666,Right. Well… no doubt you'll hear that my name is Brown. Basil Brown.
00:36:57.458,00:37:00.666,"I expect you'd, uh, be wet, coming from Ipswich on a motorbike."
00:37:04.791,00:37:07.625,"Well, I'll light the stove. Would you like some tea?"
00:37:13.625,00:37:16.666,"When this rain clears tomorrow, maybe you can see what we're doing."
00:37:17.500,00:37:19.833,-Yeah? -How very exciting.
00:37:20.333,00:37:21.750,"Yeah, it's all right."
00:37:45.208,00:37:46.125,Rory!
00:37:47.041,00:37:48.208,"Hello, Spud."
00:37:51.416,00:37:52.333,Where's your mother?
00:38:29.250,00:38:37.333,"If you are caught on the streets during an air raid, you must know the appropriate response to each form of attack."
00:38:38.083,00:38:39.708,"No, don't throw them about!"
00:39:05.666,00:39:07.416,Might that have affected the results?
00:39:12.416,00:39:17.833,"The rheumatic fever you had as a child, it, uh, damaged the valves of your heart."
00:39:18.500,00:39:19.875,"Irreparably, I'm afraid."
00:39:20.583,00:39:23.958,Another attack is likely to be much… more serious.
00:39:25.375,00:39:26.666,Possibly even fatal.
00:39:30.875,00:39:32.375,I wish I had better news.
00:41:04.041,00:41:05.791,They wouldn't stop to give me their names.
00:41:05.875,00:41:07.625,Then they're trespassing. Where are they?
00:41:07.708,00:41:09.708,"-On their way to the mounds. -Fetch them, quickly."
00:41:21.583,00:41:24.375,That's a Viking ship they found in Norway.
00:41:24.875,00:41:28.583,"There was a burial chamber in the center, roofed."
00:41:28.666,00:41:31.250,It's a bit like we imagine Noah's Ark.
00:41:32.166,00:41:34.833,"Course, any roof here would have caved in long ago."
00:41:35.833,00:41:37.750,"See, this line here."
00:41:37.833,00:41:41.416,"The ground is higher, but this soil is darker."
00:41:41.916,00:41:43.500,So you think there's something beneath?
00:41:44.291,00:41:47.791,"Well, we may know by the end of today."
00:41:47.875,00:41:49.416,Ye gods!
00:41:51.250,00:41:52.625,This is incredible!
00:41:56.416,00:42:00.041,and I… I think you'll agree that it's rock solid.
00:42:03.541,00:42:05.791,"This is a very delicate site, and it ain't safe."
00:42:05.875,00:42:07.708,"Uh, not for a man of your size."
00:42:10.291,00:42:11.166,Is this your work?
00:42:11.250,00:42:14.625,"Uh, yes. I'm Basil Brown, excavator."
00:42:21.166,00:42:33.791,"I am Charles Phillips, archaeologist, and I'm here to tell you that, as this is a find of national interest, the British Museum will be taking charge."
00:42:34.458,00:42:42.791,"Your work… looks, thankfully, decent, but your excavating service is no longer required."
00:42:42.875,00:42:47.166,Am… Am I to understand that you will be personally taking over?
00:42:47.791,00:42:50.791,"Grimes, I have never seen anything like it."
00:42:50.875,00:42:52.666,"-Quite, sir. -Brailesford."
00:42:55.500,00:42:58.458,Find out who's free. We need Piggott.
00:43:04.666,00:43:08.250,"You men, finish up, and don't move another pebble!"
00:43:13.083,00:43:18.083,"I'm employed by Mrs. Pretty, and I'll keep on working until she tells me different."
00:43:18.166,00:43:23.166,An ad hoc team from a provincial museum cannot be left in charge.
00:43:23.875,00:43:26.250,Mrs. Pretty must see that.
00:43:32.000,00:43:35.541,"John, a minute is all I need. I… I know she'll want to hear this."
00:43:35.625,00:43:37.958,"-All right, all right. Wait here. -Right."
00:43:46.583,00:43:48.375,She must know what I found.
00:44:01.625,00:44:08.625,"I… I'm sorry for disturbing you, but I believe… we may have found a burial chamber in the ship."
00:44:14.125,00:44:15.458,What are your wishes?
00:44:21.125,00:44:27.250,"I, uh… He just informed me that, by order of the Ministry of Works, the site must be placed under his control."
00:44:34.833,00:44:35.916,"…that's that, then."
00:44:40.708,00:44:41.875,if that's what you'd like.
00:44:46.291,00:44:48.458,"Are… Are you poorly, Mrs. Pretty?"
00:44:53.458,00:44:57.208,"Perhaps you might, um… might ring the bell for me."
00:44:57.958,00:44:58.791,Right.
00:45:01.000,00:45:03.083,He's got no right to dictate to you.
00:45:03.583,00:45:05.750,This ship's only appearing because of you.
00:45:06.500,00:45:08.708,Don't forget why you wanted it begun.
00:45:09.208,00:45:10.958,"Now, you said that was a feeling."
00:45:11.041,00:45:12.875,Your feeling is right.
00:45:26.750,00:45:27.625,All right.
00:45:38.500,00:45:39.958,"Fetch Ellen for me, please."
00:47:04.250,00:47:06.916,so we'll make good use of you.
00:47:07.000,00:47:10.166,Your primary task will be to keep the site in order.
00:47:10.250,00:47:18.708,"So, I want the tumulus dug back to an area of four feet on either side, and I want those spoil heaps removed."
00:47:19.250,00:47:24.708,"From now on, you're not to set foot in the body of the ship without my express permission."
00:47:24.791,00:47:25.791,Carry on.
00:47:49.250,00:47:53.208,"-My mother's got her heartburn. -Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."
00:47:53.291,00:47:56.083,She has to have peace and quiet. I made her this.
00:48:00.041,00:48:02.250,"Oh, I… Oh, I have to go home now."
00:48:02.916,00:48:04.375,When will you be back?
00:48:05.750,00:48:10.333,"Well, uh… I'm sorry, Robert. I… I am."
00:48:14.333,00:48:17.791,"Uh, but, Mr. Brown… Mr. Brown!"
00:48:26.083,00:48:28.125,His ship? Really?
00:48:28.708,00:48:31.500,I thought I might take some photographs. It could make a useful record.
00:48:31.583,00:48:33.416,-Would you mind? -Not at all.
00:48:37.125,00:48:38.750,Can't say I blame Brown.
00:48:38.833,00:48:42.125,Such a decent man doesn't deserve Phillips.
00:48:42.208,00:48:43.458,Blame him?
00:48:43.541,00:48:45.208,"Well, he left this morning. Didn't you know?"
00:48:46.750,00:48:47.875,Where's Robert?
00:49:09.000,00:49:10.750,You don't have another job?
00:49:12.500,00:49:15.416,"I'll write to Maynard, and he'll give me something."
00:49:22.458,00:49:25.708,And that's the thanks she gets for giving you the opportunity in the first place?
00:49:25.791,00:49:28.708,"Mark my words, May, I won't receive any credit."
00:49:31.500,00:49:32.833,-For credit? -How can I stay on?
00:49:32.916,00:49:36.416,Is that why you've been digging your whole life for barely enough to cover our rent?
00:49:36.500,00:49:39.708,"No, May. I do it 'cause I'm good at it."
00:49:39.791,00:49:42.750,"'Cause that's what my father taught me, and what his father taught him."
00:49:42.833,00:49:48.708,"'Cause you can show me a handful of soil from anywhere in Suffolk, and I can pretty much tell you whose land it's from."
00:49:48.791,00:49:49.791,There you go.
00:49:59.041,00:50:01.250,"-Do you know where he lives? -Yes, I know Basil."
00:50:01.333,00:50:03.666,He lives on a farm outside of the village. Carry on that way.
00:50:03.750,00:50:04.875,Thank you so much.
00:50:27.750,00:50:29.208,I found that ship.
00:50:31.083,00:50:35.083,"I may not be a fellow at Cambridge, but I worked out what was down there."
00:50:35.666,00:50:39.208,"And Jacobs and Spooner, too, and nobody'll remember that."
00:50:39.291,00:50:40.708,You don't know that.
00:50:41.583,00:50:44.750,"And if you're not around to see it to the end, there's even less chance."
00:50:46.708,00:50:49.750,You always told me your work isn't about the past or even the present.
00:50:49.833,00:50:51.000,It's for the future.
00:50:51.708,00:50:55.541,So that the next generations can know where they came from.
00:50:56.583,00:50:58.833,The line that joins them to their forebears.
00:50:58.916,00:51:00.333,Isn't that what you always say?
00:51:03.958,00:51:05.416,"Yeah, something like that."
00:51:08.291,00:51:10.708,while the rest of the country prepares for war?
00:51:15.750,00:51:19.416,Something that'll last longer than whatever damn war we're heading into.
00:51:24.041,00:51:25.166,Good hell.
00:51:26.333,00:51:27.416,That's Robert.
00:51:37.083,00:51:38.083,You promised.
00:51:38.958,00:51:39.916,May! May!
00:51:40.375,00:51:43.541,You said you'd show me the cosmos. You promised.
00:51:49.041,00:51:51.458,"I bet you have a rare thirst after that long ride, don't you?"
00:51:56.041,00:51:57.666,"Does your mother know you're here, Robert?"
00:52:02.625,00:52:04.916,"I better find a telephone, May. Call Mrs. Pretty."
00:52:22.750,00:52:27.250,"-We were obviously very worried. -Yes. He's… He's… Uh, this is May, my wife."
00:52:27.333,00:52:29.458,-Mrs. Pretty. -Thank you very much.
00:52:30.041,00:52:32.833,He's been no trouble. A lovely boy.
00:52:33.375,00:52:37.666,Mrs. Brown has a music box from Whitby covered in all manner of shells.
00:52:37.750,00:52:38.875,Would you like to see?
00:52:38.958,00:52:42.083,"Uh, no. We've imposed on your kindness enough."
00:52:42.583,00:52:44.166,What were you thinking?
00:52:45.291,00:52:47.125,You could have been lost or killed.
00:52:51.500,00:52:54.875,"Uh, Robert came to remind me of a promise that I made."
00:52:55.375,00:52:58.458,I said I'd show him the stars through my telescope.
00:52:59.125,00:53:00.041,Didn't I?
00:53:00.833,00:53:02.125,Then you're returning?
00:53:03.333,00:53:05.291,I am. Yes.
00:53:24.958,00:53:29.458,"Mr. Grimes. I've been, uh… taking notes."
00:53:30.541,00:53:32.333,-Ah! -If they be of any use.
00:53:32.416,00:53:34.291,"Why, they'd save me days."
00:53:42.000,00:53:43.250,Thank you kindly.
00:53:53.625,00:53:56.125,that there could be an intact chamber.
00:54:07.708,00:54:09.166,How do you think it will affect us?
00:54:12.166,00:54:18.166,"I think we could be at war in a matter of weeks, and every excavation in the land will stop."
00:54:30.500,00:54:33.625,"-This is my wife, Margaret. -Peggy."
00:54:39.625,00:54:41.291,that you specifically asked for me to come.
00:54:41.375,00:54:43.875,I know Stuart sent you my paper on Bosnian Lake villagers.
00:54:43.958,00:54:46.500,It was awfully good of you to read it.
00:54:48.083,00:54:50.500,"Ah, yes. Um, very stimulating."
00:54:55.541,00:54:58.458,It's just that I haven't done much actual fieldwork yet.
00:54:58.541,00:55:01.833,"Uh, so I wouldn't want you to think I'm more experienced than I really am."
00:55:08.958,00:55:12.291,"One could say, it, um, scarcely exists at all."
00:55:13.000,00:55:15.083,"Too much weight, it disintegrates."
00:55:15.166,00:55:23.458,"You're probably less than nine stone, so I'll supervise from here while you light things get on with the digging."
00:55:25.666,00:55:28.208,Am I to understand you only asked for me because of my size?
00:55:28.291,00:55:30.000,"Uh, lucky guess, actually."
00:57:02.333,00:57:05.166,We don't… We don't want to start by making a fuss.
00:57:05.250,00:57:07.000,"Oh, no. Of course not."
00:57:22.625,00:57:27.291,Would you prefer this bed… or… or… or that one?
00:57:27.375,00:57:29.250,"I'll… I'll take this one, shall I?"
00:57:44.666,00:57:45.958,Ah!
00:57:53.916,00:57:56.916,"Ten more minutes, Commander. Then, bed."
00:58:44.416,00:58:46.916,"-Piggott, get her off! -Oh, I'm so sorry!"
00:59:00.583,00:59:03.541,"You, get your camera down there. Photograph it."
00:59:03.625,00:59:05.791,That's… That's very hot in the full sun.
00:59:05.875,00:59:08.458,"Oh, I'm fine. Thank you."
00:59:08.958,00:59:12.250,Watch your step there. This could well be our chamber.
00:59:28.625,00:59:31.083,-We came straight from our holiday. -Did you really?
00:59:34.500,00:59:35.916,Let's see what we can find.
00:59:39.666,00:59:41.333,Is Mrs. Pretty still poorly?
00:59:44.125,00:59:56.041,"She says she's perfectly fine, but… Damn this weather."
00:59:57.291,00:59:59.125,Losing a whole day.
01:00:00.041,01:00:06.208,So little time before world events… confound us.
01:00:15.791,01:00:17.625,"Well, that's an excellent idea."
01:00:18.125,01:00:21.875,Stuart couldn't fault his work. Could he not be unearthing the stern?
01:00:24.500,01:00:27.625,"Well, that's just snobbery, isn't it, Mr. Phillips?"
01:00:40.083,01:00:41.875,"Brown, come here, man!"
01:01:03.375,01:01:04.875,Sorry. I forgot to lock the door.
01:01:08.500,01:01:12.500,"with… with four other rooms, and, you know, I could have been anyone."
01:01:16.000,01:01:17.500,But you're not. You're my husband.
01:01:20.541,01:01:22.583,if… if one of them saw you in that state?
01:01:30.833,01:01:32.625,"Christ, I-- Stop."
01:01:32.708,01:01:40.416,"You should be more careful. It's… You know, now, after… after waiting eons, I shall… I shall go and have my bath."
01:02:27.333,01:02:28.750,You made me appear late.
01:02:41.833,01:02:43.458,-Very delicate. -You ready?
01:02:44.875,01:02:47.791,You have to be very careful now. No cavalier lifting.
01:03:35.791,01:03:36.791,Phillips!
01:03:40.083,01:03:43.333,"-Look at this, sir. -Look. Look!"
01:03:47.416,01:03:48.416,Phillips.
01:04:34.875,01:04:37.500,"I, uh, found it down between the strikes."
01:04:38.000,01:04:40.791,I believe that's a Merovingian tremissis.
01:04:44.416,01:04:48.791,Viking East Anglia didn't have a coin-based economy till the 9th century.
01:04:52.375,01:04:54.000,Mr. Brown has always said so.
01:05:05.333,01:05:06.708,This is Anglo-Saxon.
01:05:08.333,01:05:10.208,Piggott! Grimes!
01:05:10.291,01:05:12.791,"It's Dark Age, by Jupiter!"
01:05:12.875,01:05:14.250,Sixth century!
01:05:14.333,01:05:16.583,This changes everything.
01:05:16.666,01:05:20.875,These people were not just marauding barterers.
01:05:20.958,01:05:22.375,They had culture!
01:05:23.125,01:05:24.125,They had art!
01:05:24.708,01:05:26.125,They had money!
01:05:30.958,01:05:32.208,"Oh, good God."
01:06:07.041,01:06:08.541,Are you camping out here?
01:06:22.875,01:06:25.500,-Is he? -They're sending his papers any day.
01:06:25.583,01:06:27.250,He's going to get his wings.
01:06:27.958,01:06:28.833,Huh.
01:06:33.250,01:06:37.000,"Well done, everybody, on a splendid effort."
01:06:37.750,01:06:44.083,"Brailesford, Piggott, if you'll start loading the gold into the car, we'll get it straight to the British Museum."
01:06:47.583,01:06:50.625,"Well, it's the obvious place for it, Mrs. Pretty."
01:06:55.791,01:06:58.958,"The British Museum is currently being emptied of its treasures, isn't it?"
01:07:06.708,01:07:10.041,"There'll be an inquest, as you know, and its fate will be decided there."
01:07:10.833,01:07:17.166,"Until then, Mr. Brown… as the finder of this magnificent ship, would you please take the treasure up to the house?"
01:07:17.666,01:07:19.083,"Uh, yes, Mrs. Pretty."
01:07:19.166,01:07:20.666,Thank you all very much.
01:07:30.708,01:07:32.208,It's found on her land.
01:07:34.458,01:07:37.166,whether the treasure belongs to Mrs. Pretty or the Crown.
01:07:44.625,01:07:46.000,It's someone's grave.
01:07:52.291,01:07:53.791,And that's why we dig.
01:08:23.166,01:08:25.500,They're like emissaries from another world.
01:08:39.583,01:08:42.791,"Now, whenever I hear nightingales, I think of these woods."
01:08:47.666,01:08:51.125,Never heard a nightingale at all. Only on the wireless.
01:08:51.625,01:08:54.500,There's a wonderful cellist called Beatrice Harrison.
01:08:54.583,01:09:01.708,"In the summer evenings, she used to practice in the garden, and… one night, she was playing a scale, and a… a nightingale joined in."
01:09:02.791,01:09:08.041,"At first, she couldn't believe it. She started playing a sonata, and the nightingale accompanied her."
01:09:13.416,01:09:16.791,"Miss Harrison was so excited about it, she went to the BBC and told them all about it."
01:09:20.083,01:09:23.875,the BBC came and put their recording equipment in Miss Harrison's garden.
01:09:24.375,01:09:35.000,"She started to play, and they waited and, um, waited… and… and at last, the nightingale began to sing."
01:09:37.416,01:09:42.875,Went on for about 15 minutes… rising and falling with the cello.
01:09:47.416,01:09:48.791,-Yes. -Wow.
01:09:49.541,01:09:51.291,I know. Hmm.
01:09:55.583,01:10:09.625,But… the really extraordinary thing is that… other people who'd been listening to the broadcast in their gardens reported that other nightingales also started to sing.
01:10:10.625,01:10:11.958,"Well, that's wonderful."
01:10:13.833,01:10:16.750,"Yes, it was. It was wonderful."
01:10:26.583,01:10:29.416,Well… good night.
01:10:31.875,01:10:34.291,I shall listen out for cellos in the woods.
01:11:03.750,01:11:06.166,"-Beowulf. -Arthur, King of the Britons."
01:11:06.250,01:11:07.291,Cheers.
01:11:07.375,01:11:11.291,Talk about Dark Ages. I can hardly see my pint.
01:11:11.375,01:11:12.750,What actually is that?
01:11:16.416,01:11:19.875,"So Germans will be coming by air this time, will they?"
01:11:20.791,01:11:22.916,"Last time, they came by the river."
01:11:23.000,01:11:24.250,In AD 600.
01:11:26.958,01:11:29.708,"You know, I'm… It's been a big day. I'm quite done in."
01:11:29.791,01:11:31.625,"Um, will you all excuse me?"
01:11:31.708,01:11:34.833,"-Aw. -Well done, Mrs. P, on a marvelous find."
01:11:36.875,01:11:39.291,"-Yeah. No, I'll come with you, darling. -No."
01:11:39.375,01:11:42.625,"No, no. Um, surely you want to celebrate."
01:11:42.708,01:11:47.583,"-Stay for another, Piggott. -My round. Set them up again, would you?"
01:11:47.666,01:11:52.291,"I say, C.W., ask him if he'll take a Merovingian tremissis."
01:11:56.541,01:12:13.000,"the menacing statements of the statesmen leading the policy of Germany, the systematic provocation of frontier incidents, and finally, the constantly increasing concentrations of mobilized armed forces at the Polish frontiers constitute an obvious proof of this."
01:12:13.083,01:12:22.041,"A Labour deputation called on the Prime Minister last night, requesting the immediate evacuation of women, children, and cripples as precaution against the sudden outbreak of war."
01:12:30.958,01:12:33.500,"If they get away, I'll put every man of you in the robot battalion!"
01:12:45.375,01:12:51.125,"Darling, C.W. wants me to take some of the corroded iron to the lab."
01:12:51.208,01:12:58.666,"Uh, we think it might be fragmented armor, and I… I badly want to start cleaning it up. So… Am I to come with you?"
01:12:58.750,01:13:05.500,"No, because C.W. needs all the hands he can get here, so, uh… And he's very pleased with you."
01:13:07.875,01:13:11.958,"Uh, so I'm taking Brailesford because the lab's really his thing."
01:13:12.041,01:13:15.375,-You know. -Ah. Oh.
01:13:16.250,01:13:18.333,"You're going to have to be a brick about it, Margaret."
01:13:21.083,01:13:22.250,My name's Peggy.
01:13:39.125,01:13:42.666,"I'll… I'll… I'll miss you very much, Peggy."
01:13:47.583,01:13:49.333,Sorry to take him away from you.
01:14:01.458,01:14:03.791,Mr. Phillips would bore you quite to death.
01:14:04.416,01:14:08.208,"Um, have you developed any of your photographs yet, Mr. Lomax?"
01:14:08.291,01:14:12.041,"I've made a start. I've got a mountain to do, and I better get through them."
01:14:12.125,01:14:13.916,I could get my papers any day.
01:14:14.541,01:14:16.791,Rory has been accepted into the RAF.
01:14:18.000,01:14:19.541,Should I congratulate you?
01:14:20.041,01:14:22.625,I don't know. Cousin Edith didn't.
01:14:26.333,01:14:27.416,This looks delicious.
01:14:52.291,01:14:57.291,The people who buried that ship… What did they believe?
01:15:02.875,01:15:06.083,Down to the underworld or up to the stars.
01:15:17.916,01:15:20.000,The coroner has been in touch.
01:15:21.000,01:15:24.416,"An inquest has been called for Friday, and your presence is required."
01:15:26.541,01:15:29.458,There's been quite a lot of public interest in our ship.
01:15:29.541,01:15:32.541,"So afterwards, I've invited everyone to come and see it."
01:15:32.625,01:15:34.208,Uh… everyone?
01:15:38.791,01:15:44.083,May I remind you just how fragile this site is?
01:15:45.291,01:15:48.541,Please feel free to invite your families and friends.
01:15:50.125,01:15:57.916,Mrs. Pretty… Good God.
01:16:14.958,01:16:18.041,Don't let anyone swim! It's tidal. The current is fierce!
01:16:18.125,01:16:19.000,Darling.
01:17:39.291,01:17:42.416,They train these boys on rickety planes from the Great War.
01:17:44.125,01:17:48.000,"My husband said, If you want your son to die, then let him join the Air Force."
01:17:56.958,01:17:58.375,Is he all right?
01:17:59.083,01:18:02.083,-I must get Robert up to the house. -Shall I take him for you?
01:18:02.166,01:18:05.791,"-He won't want to go. -Uh, I'll ask him to look after me."
01:18:14.166,01:18:18.958,"Oh, well, when I feel faint, I have a good lie-down and a big glass of water."
01:19:10.750,01:19:15.708,Police and the coroner are here. I brought you some dry things.
01:19:26.458,01:19:27.750,Would you like some?
01:19:34.458,01:19:36.000,on a holiday in Cornwall.
01:19:36.541,01:19:38.541,He was taken by the current.
01:19:41.791,01:19:43.333,It was a long time ago.
01:19:44.583,01:19:45.958,He had epilepsy.
01:19:49.833,01:19:51.750,"So, what drew you to photography?"
01:19:54.166,01:19:59.208,It's just a way of trying to fix things as they… as they go past.
01:20:03.916,01:20:12.166,My father once gave me an old coin… and he said it was from the time of Caesar Augustus.
01:20:13.875,01:20:18.583,And I knew the story from the Bible where Jesus showed the disciples a coin.
01:20:18.666,01:20:21.541,Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's.
01:20:27.666,01:20:34.125,"…well, I… I became convinced that the coin I had was the one that Jesus had actually shown the disciples."
01:20:34.625,01:20:38.750,I used to marvel that I could hold it.
01:20:43.125,01:20:44.750,What happened to your coin?
01:20:45.916,01:21:03.750,Oh… Uh… I thought it might bring me luck.
01:21:06.666,01:21:07.583,And has it?
01:21:16.666,01:21:27.333,"If 1,000 years… were to pass in an instant… what would be left of us?"
01:21:34.333,01:21:35.833,And parts of your watch.
01:21:36.791,01:21:37.916,Torch.
01:21:39.833,01:21:41.125,Fragments of the mug.
01:22:10.250,01:22:11.666,"Yes, darling."
01:22:16.875,01:22:17.833,Wait.
01:22:23.166,01:22:24.166,I'm sorry.
01:22:24.958,01:22:25.916,No.
01:22:35.666,01:22:36.791,You won't die?
01:23:12.916,01:23:16.791,"-Perhaps you might lead me to my room. -Yes, of course. Of course."
01:23:25.625,01:23:42.791,It's heartburn. It's… Would you mind… Would you mind getting me some milk?
01:24:07.166,01:24:11.250,I know she's sick. I know it! There's nothing I can do!
01:24:11.333,01:24:14.458,Why is there nothing I can do? I should be able to make her better.
01:24:14.541,01:24:16.833,You do. You do make her better.
01:24:23.916,01:24:24.958,She is.
01:24:29.250,01:24:36.500,When… When my father died… …everyone said I had to look after my mother.
01:24:39.958,01:24:41.291,I failed.
01:24:45.750,01:24:51.958,Robert… …we all fail.
01:24:54.375,01:24:55.458,Every day.
01:24:56.916,01:25:03.833,There are some things we just can't succeed at… no matter how hard we try.
01:25:09.500,01:25:11.750,I know it's not what you want to hear.
01:25:12.416,01:25:15.000,I… I'm stronger than she thinks I am.
01:25:22.791,01:25:27.708,"Now… we should get you inside, Robert."
01:25:28.791,01:25:29.708,Come on.
01:25:30.666,01:25:33.083,"I think it's time for your bed, you know. Come on, then."
01:25:47.791,01:25:49.333,of hacks on the way.
01:25:50.208,01:25:57.083,I already have some joker from the Sunday Mirror asking me if the ship is still seaworthy.
01:25:57.166,01:26:01.416,"So, what happens to the treasure? That's the real question."
01:26:04.750,01:26:06.166,…and has bombed many towns.
01:26:06.250,01:26:14.458,"Orders completing the mobilization of the Navy, Army, and Air Force were signed by the King at a meeting this afternoon of the privy council."
01:26:19.750,01:26:20.875,"Here we go, then."
01:26:20.958,01:26:24.958,The Queen drove from the palace to visit the Westminister ARP headquarters.
01:27:00.416,01:27:03.041,I'm to report to RAF Martlesham this morning.
01:27:03.750,01:27:05.166,There's the inquest.
01:27:09.708,01:27:13.166,I put some photographs in the dining room for your guests.
01:27:14.333,01:27:17.833,"Rory, I'm telling you in no uncertain terms that you cannot possibly die."
01:27:30.375,01:27:32.083,Robert is going to need you.
01:27:34.416,01:27:35.666,Do you understand?
01:27:38.416,01:27:41.458,-Today's the day. -I want to take my mother sailing.
01:27:41.541,01:27:43.333,I don't think that ship is sailing anywhere.
01:27:43.416,01:27:45.708,"You know, it's just compacted sand."
01:27:46.375,01:27:49.291,"There's nothing holding it, except time."
01:27:49.375,01:27:52.916,"-That won't matter. Not where we're going. -Now, where's that, then?"
01:28:03.833,01:28:04.916,Those for me?
01:28:09.000,01:28:10.958,"Well, perhaps you'd say goodbye for me."
01:28:11.958,01:28:13.375,I've been called up.
01:28:13.458,01:28:14.458,Oh.
01:28:15.166,01:28:16.250,Of course.
01:28:17.333,01:28:19.500,"Well, best of British."
01:28:20.000,01:28:21.458,Stuart.
01:28:26.083,01:28:26.916,How lovely.
01:28:32.250,01:28:35.583,"Um, Lomax was just telling me that he's been called up."
01:28:39.041,01:28:40.000,Oh.
01:28:46.958,01:28:49.250,"Uh, I'd better go. Goodbye."
01:28:57.833,01:29:19.125,Uh… Warsaw has been bombed six times today.
01:29:20.000,01:29:24.875,The telegram adds that fighting of a most serious nature continues on the whole length of the front.
01:29:24.958,01:29:27.125,We're in for another bloody mess.
01:29:50.500,01:29:53.958,Maynard? Can you make sure my wife gets in the house?
01:30:38.791,01:30:41.291,Thank you. Thank you.
01:30:48.291,01:30:54.708,These… These… These were… These were sophisticated people with incredible artistry.
01:30:56.708,01:31:00.375,The Dark Ages are no longer dark.
01:31:10.791,01:31:12.666,"This is sherry. I suppose it's sherry, is it?"
01:31:14.958,01:31:17.291,"Should we drink it now, or is there going to be a toast?"
01:31:17.375,01:31:18.958,What's everyone else doing?
01:31:31.791,01:31:39.291,"that they were recovered from a chamber in the middle of a ship… a burial ship, engineered from oak."
01:31:40.750,01:31:44.333,"In my opinion, the greatest and most beautiful treasure of all."
01:31:45.708,01:31:49.125,"Ninety feet long, lying east to west."
01:31:50.541,01:31:53.625,Found and excavated by Mr. Basil Brown.
01:31:55.000,01:31:56.333,-To Basil! -Mr. Brown!
01:32:16.041,01:32:17.208,I'm terribly sorry.
01:32:19.833,01:32:23.583,I thought you'd be pleased with the verdict.
01:32:34.625,01:32:36.541,We die and we decay.
01:32:38.375,01:32:39.791,We don't live on.
01:32:43.958,01:32:45.833,I'm not sure I agree.
01:32:47.250,01:32:55.208,From the first human handprint on a cave wall… we're part of something continuous.
01:33:35.666,01:33:37.333,It completely slipped my mind.
01:33:52.500,01:33:53.500,Sit down.
01:34:05.458,01:34:06.916,but it's not enough.
01:34:10.416,01:34:11.875,Life is very fleeting.
01:34:13.583,01:34:14.666,I've learnt that.
01:34:16.041,01:34:18.166,It has moments you should seize.
01:34:25.041,01:34:28.208,"It could not be a better result, Mrs. Pretty."
01:34:28.791,01:34:30.541,The whole of Suffolk has been on your side.
01:34:33.958,01:34:36.666,Did she mention her intentions?
01:34:39.916,01:34:42.166,"-Oh. -Yes, what's she planning?"
01:34:42.250,01:34:49.041,"We hope that you'll agree that the Ipswich Museum is the perfect place for-- -Can we talk another time? Excuse me. -Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. Yes."
01:34:51.083,01:34:52.791,Don't let her give it to Ipswich.
01:34:53.416,01:34:55.541,The British Museum would buy everything.
01:34:55.625,01:34:59.625,"It's priceless, of course, but she'll have to be reasonable."
01:34:59.708,01:35:01.916,Are you asking me to plead your case?
01:35:03.583,01:35:06.166,"Have some lemon drizzle cake, Mr. Phillips."
01:35:06.250,01:35:07.750,It is most refreshing.
01:35:09.541,01:35:12.500,Thank you so much for what you said. I could have cheered.
01:35:23.833,01:35:26.291,Perhaps you might let him visit you from time to time.
01:35:27.333,01:35:28.333,Of course.
01:35:29.166,01:35:30.541,We'd be glad to.
01:35:44.041,01:35:47.041,C.W.'s suggesting we make a move to the ball.
01:35:52.791,01:35:54.125,"…uh, without me."
01:35:55.041,01:35:57.875,"So, will… will you follow us?"
01:36:01.208,01:36:04.625,I… I don't think so.
01:36:10.791,01:36:11.750,No.
01:36:13.291,01:36:17.000,"We both have our own paths to, um, follow, don't we?"
01:36:17.083,01:36:19.708,And I've seen you when you're happy.
01:36:20.625,01:36:21.916,You're rather beautiful.
01:36:34.000,01:36:36.250,I think that would be an awful shame.
01:36:44.416,01:36:45.333,Go on.
01:36:54.250,01:36:55.333,Go on.
01:37:29.208,01:37:38.208,"That site, it needs to be made safe for the future, so it… it don't further decay. So… that's another week's work."
01:37:44.416,01:37:45.958,Do you take care of her.
01:37:52.375,01:37:54.458,You… You don't want to stay the night?
01:37:55.125,01:37:57.041,I'll see you next week.
01:38:16.583,01:38:23.000,and cover that with a… a layer of branches… to protect it from the weight of the earth.
01:38:23.083,01:38:25.083,All this soil's got to go back in.
01:38:26.708,01:38:28.250,Leave it as we found it.
01:38:30.708,01:38:33.208,I'm giving the treasure to the British Museum.
01:38:35.166,01:38:36.375,As a gift.
01:38:39.250,01:38:42.625,It should be where the greatest number of people can freely see it.
01:38:45.333,01:38:46.750,I haven't told them yet.
01:38:48.041,01:38:49.500,I wanted to tell you.
01:38:58.333,01:38:59.875,"Apparently, they haven't."
01:39:03.000,01:39:07.750,I also told Mr. Phillips that I expect your work to receive proper recognition.
01:39:13.708,01:39:14.666,Thank you.
01:40:30.041,01:40:32.000,We're coming towards the edge of the atmosphere.
01:40:32.083,01:40:33.625,"Can you see it, Mother?"
01:40:33.708,01:40:35.750,We're sailing into the cosmos.
01:40:36.250,01:40:39.250,"Yes, I can. Where are we heading?"
01:40:39.333,01:40:42.500,"Orion's Belt, to take the Queen home."
01:40:44.541,01:40:49.041,This boat's hers. Her people gave her treasure for her home voyage.
01:40:57.375,01:41:01.291,because she knew she'd be leaving everyone behind.
01:41:02.750,01:41:13.041,And she was worried that they wouldn't get on very well without her… but she knew she had to follow the King into the sky.
01:41:14.041,01:41:19.750,"And so, she set off… through the Earth and up into the cosmos."
01:41:23.541,01:41:28.875,"Time operates quite differently up there, and 500 years can pass in a flash."
01:41:31.083,01:41:33.458,And the Queen looked back down to Earth.
01:41:34.166,01:41:38.791,She could see that her son had grown up and that he was now a space pilot.
01:41:48.125,01:41:50.166,she would be there to meet him.
01:42:06.083,01:42:26.166,"in Berlin handed the German government a final note… stating that, unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock, that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us."
01:42:27.000,01:42:38.333,"I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that, consequently, this country is at war with Germany."
01:42:38.416,01:42:40.875,"-Good night, sir. -Good night to you."
01:42:47.916,01:42:51.250,that all my long struggle to win peace has failed.
01:42:51.333,01:42:53.125,-Good night to you. -Good night.
01:42:59.250,01:43:11.500,under which it will be possible to carry on the work of the nation in the days of stress and strain that may be ahead… …but these plans need your help.
01:43:20.833,01:43:22.250,or as a volunteer.
01:43:24.083,01:43:29.250,"If so, you will report for duty in accordance with the instructions you receive."
01:43:46.791,01:43:49.166,"Now, may God bless you all."
