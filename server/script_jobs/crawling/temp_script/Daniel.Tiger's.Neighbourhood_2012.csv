00:00:52.500,00:00:54.583,"- Hi, neighbour!"
00:00:54.625,00:00:56.417,It's snowing!
00:00:56.458,00:00:59.041,First snow of the year. Look!
00:00:59.083,00:01:01.625,- Hey! You caught a snowflake!
00:01:01.667,00:01:04.417,- I know. You catch one too.
00:01:04.458,00:01:07.000,- Oh! Caught a snowflake!
00:01:07.041,00:01:09.792,- We caught a lot of snowflakes.
00:01:09.834,00:01:12.291,I just love the snow.
00:01:12.333,00:01:16.000,"- Me too, but..."
00:01:16.041,00:01:18.875,- Brr.
00:01:18.917,00:01:20.875,"- OK, Daniel..."
00:01:20.917,00:01:23.166,- ...let's get you dressed.
00:01:20.917,00:01:25.959,"- Oh, yeah, I'm still wearing my PJs! Hop, hop, hop, hop!"
00:01:26.000,00:01:30.000,"Hop, hop, hop, hop!"
00:01:30.041,00:01:32.250,"Ding, ding!"
00:01:30.041,00:01:35.625,"- OK, Daniel, this isn't time to play."
00:01:35.667,00:01:37.166,Miss Elaina will be here soon.
00:01:37.208,00:01:42.125,"- But my PJs are so comfy cozy, comfy cozy!"
00:01:42.166,00:01:48.834,"- PJs are comfy cozy, but PJs are for bed, and you're not going to bed right now."
00:01:48.875,00:01:51.208,- No.
00:02:03.625,00:02:08.959,"I'm playing with Miss Elaina today, so I need to pick clothes that are good for playing."
00:02:09.000,00:02:10.542,But what should I wear?
00:02:10.583,00:02:12.959,Hmm... I know!
00:02:13.000,00:02:16.917,Be right back.
00:02:16.959,00:02:19.750,Should I wear my swimsuit?
00:02:24.417,00:02:29.250,"No! My swimsuit is for swimming, not a cold snowy day."
00:02:29.291,00:02:30.750,I'll try something else.
00:02:33.000,00:02:35.291,Should I wear my raincoat?
00:02:38.250,00:02:42.750,"No! My raincoat is for rain, not a cold snowy day."
00:02:42.792,00:02:44.792,I have another idea.
00:02:47.000,00:02:50.166,Should I wear my red sweater?
00:02:50.208,00:02:51.792,Ta-da!
00:02:51.834,00:02:56.375,Yes! A sweater is good for playing inside on a cold snowy day.
00:03:00.792,00:03:05.834,"Oh, wow the snow is really coming down out there."
00:03:05.875,00:03:10.583,"- It is. OK, my fuzzy guy, Miss Elaina should be here to play soon."
00:03:10.625,00:03:13.000,I'm going to go do some work.
00:03:13.041,00:03:16.917,Wow! Look at all the snowflakes.
00:03:16.959,00:03:21.208,"They're covering up my whole yard, and my whole house!"
00:03:21.250,00:03:24.542,It looks like snow people should be living here.
00:03:24.583,00:03:31.000,"Hey, let's make believe that a snow family really DID live here."
00:04:05.083,00:04:07.792,- That snow family was grr-ific!
00:04:07.834,00:04:10.208,Miss Elaina's here!
00:04:10.250,00:04:12.458,"- Come on, let's go play with Miss Elaina."
00:04:12.500,00:04:15.208,Miss Elaina!
00:04:15.250,00:04:18.166,"Hiya, neighbour! It's snowing!"
00:04:18.208,00:04:19.792,- What did you say?
00:04:19.834,00:04:21.792,- Let me see if I can help here.
00:04:21.834,00:04:26.041,"- Whoa! I said, It's snowing!"
00:04:26.083,00:04:29.291,And I brought...
00:04:29.333,00:04:31.583,- Thanks! Let's zoom!
00:04:31.625,00:04:33.583,- Miss Elaina.
00:04:33.625,00:04:35.583,- Aren't you forgetting something?
00:04:35.625,00:04:39.291,"- Oh, yeah. I don't need my snowsuit anymore."
00:04:39.333,00:04:41.667,Phew! Thanks Mrs. Tiger!
00:04:41.709,00:04:44.375,- No problem.
00:04:44.417,00:04:47.083,Zoooom!

00:04:50.166,00:04:52.417,"- Zoom, zoom, zoom!"
00:04:52.458,00:04:57.792,"- Zoooom! Astronaut Miss Elaina, we have an important outer space mission."
00:04:57.834,00:05:00.750,- We do?
00:05:00.792,00:05:02.917,We have an important outer space mission.
00:05:02.959,00:05:04.542,What's our mission?
00:05:04.583,00:05:08.625,- We are on a mission to find Astronaut Tigey. He's hiding.
00:05:08.667,00:05:11.166,"See if you can find him, OK?"
00:05:13.417,00:05:15.959,"Tigey, come out, come out wherever you are!"
00:05:16.000,00:05:18.375,Do you see Tigey?
00:05:18.417,00:05:20.417,- I see him!
00:05:20.458,00:05:26.917,"- OK, astronauts, we need to sneak up quietly and catch Astronaut Tigey, OK?"
00:05:26.959,00:05:29.917,"Ready, one, two..."
00:05:29.959,00:05:31.875,- THREE!
00:05:31.917,00:05:38.834,"- Come on, Astronaut Tigey, let's floooooat in outer space!"
00:05:38.875,00:05:41.458,"Tigey, look at all the snow!"
00:05:41.500,00:05:45.291,"- There is so much snow, and it is so pretty!"
00:05:45.333,00:05:47.917,- Do you want to go play outside? In the snow?
00:05:47.959,00:05:51.208,- Yes! We can go on a snow mission!
00:05:51.250,00:05:53.250,In the snow.
00:05:53.291,00:05:56.834,- We can be...
00:05:56.875,00:06:00.000,- Let's blast off to ask my mom.
00:06:00.041,00:06:02.667,"- OK, toots, let's do our countdown!"
00:06:02.709,00:06:04.542,"- Count with us, from three."
00:06:08.542,00:06:11.458,blast off! Zoom! Zoom!
00:06:11.500,00:06:14.375,- Where are you astronauts zooming off to?
00:06:14.417,00:06:17.417,- We want to be snow astronauts!
00:06:17.458,00:06:20.375,"- Well, that's a fun idea."
00:06:20.417,00:06:22.417,"- Ooh! Come on, come on, come on, come on!"
00:06:22.458,00:06:25.208,Let's go play in the snow!
00:06:22.458,00:06:27.583,"- Daniel, Miss Elaina, are you forgetting something?"
00:06:39.959,00:06:44.458,"We're going to play snow astronauts, in the snow..."
00:06:44.500,00:06:46.417,so what clothes are right for that?
00:06:46.458,00:06:49.041,"- Well, it's cold outside right now."
00:06:49.083,00:06:51.959,"- Yeah, so I need something warm."
00:06:52.000,00:06:55.875,Like... my snowsuit!
00:06:55.917,00:06:58.125,"I'm wearing my snowsuit, toots!"
00:06:58.166,00:07:01.250,"- OK, I guess I need to wear my snowsuit in the snow."
00:07:01.291,00:07:05.375,And my boots.
00:07:05.417,00:07:11.500,"- And now, you just need to take off your space helmet so we can put on your hat and mittens."
00:07:11.542,00:07:15.458,- No! I can't be an astronaut with a hat and mittens!
00:07:15.500,00:07:18.583,I want to wear my space helmet!
00:07:18.625,00:07:21.959,"- Yeah, and it is no fun to be cold, toots."
00:07:22.000,00:07:23.583,- I won't be cold.
00:07:23.625,00:07:26.166,"- Daniel, your paws are gonna get cold."
00:07:26.208,00:07:28.166,"- No, they won't, they really won't!"
00:07:28.208,00:07:31.250,Can I please just wear my snowsuit and my space helmet?
00:07:31.291,00:07:36.375,"- Hmm. All right, Daniel, you can try it, but come back in if you get cold."
00:07:36.417,00:07:39.125,- OK.
00:07:39.166,00:07:42.083,Woo-hoo!

00:07:47.166,00:07:49.000,"Uh, Daniel?"
00:07:49.041,00:07:51.959,"Daniel, why aren't you playing?"
00:07:49.041,00:07:55.709,"- Well, I want to, but... it's cold!"
00:07:55.750,00:07:57.667,- Daniel?
00:08:03.834,00:08:08.625,I'm going to play in the snow so I need my hat and mittens.
00:08:08.667,00:08:11.792,"- Now, that is a good choice."

00:08:28.083,00:08:33.000,"- OK, let's make one more snowball."
00:08:33.041,00:08:36.834,"- Mom, Dad, can you help us put this snowball on top?"
00:08:36.875,00:08:40.667,- OK. Here we go!
00:08:40.709,00:08:44.750,- Look! It's a snow astronaut!

00:08:48.000,00:08:50.000,- And a carrot nose.
00:08:50.041,00:08:53.083,"- Now, what should a snow astronaut wear?"
00:08:59.709,00:09:06.208,"- The snow astronaut is going to space, so he needs a..."
00:09:06.250,00:09:08.667,- That sounds like a mission for Mom!

00:12:09.625,00:12:14.917,"After all, Katerina, you might want to do something today where you don't want to wear your tutu."

00:04:07.834,00:04:10.500,"- Well, here's the secret."
00:04:10.542,00:04:14.917,The orange part of the carrot is... in the ground.
00:04:14.959,00:04:16.917,- Do you want to pull a carrot out and see?
00:04:16.959,00:04:18.917,- Yes!

00:04:38.792,00:04:42.875,- See? The orange part of the carrot grows under the ground.
00:04:42.917,00:04:47.375,"- I liked pulling the carrot, but I don't want to try the carrot."
00:04:47.417,00:04:49.750,- It's OK.
00:04:49.792,00:04:53.333,- Can you believe carrots grow under the ground?
00:04:53.375,00:04:55.750,I wonder what it's like under there.
00:04:55.792,00:04:59.583,"Heeey, do you want to make-believe with me?"
00:04:59.625,00:05:04.959,Let's make believe that we're underground with the carrots!
00:05:18.625,00:05:41.208,"you gotta dig, dig - Ha! Ha! Wasn't that grr-ific?"
00:05:41.250,00:05:46.333,all ready to eat!
00:05:46.375,00:05:48.375,- Delicious. Here you go.
00:05:52.583,00:05:56.125,Make sure you chew those carrots well!
00:05:56.166,00:05:58.125,- Crunchy!
00:05:58.166,00:06:00.417,Thank you!
00:06:00.458,00:06:02.750,"- Try this, Prince Wednesday."
00:06:02.792,00:06:05.166,"- Mm... Heh, heh."
00:06:02.792,00:06:08.208,I don't think I like the carrots.
00:06:08.250,00:06:11.250,"- Well, that's OK."
00:06:11.291,00:06:14.417,Katerina? Would you like to try a carrot?
00:06:14.458,00:06:18.125,"- Mmm, no, thank you."
00:06:25.000,00:06:27.166,- Ooh! I'll have it!
00:06:27.208,00:06:31.250,"I love, love, love carrots!"
00:06:31.291,00:06:33.125,- You really like those carrots?
00:06:33.166,00:06:35.375,- Uh-huh!
00:06:35.417,00:06:40.000,"- OK, the next veggie to look for is bell peppers!"
00:06:40.041,00:06:42.875,- Where could it be? Over here?
00:06:42.917,00:06:46.166,"- Hmm, I don't know."
00:06:46.208,00:06:48.959,- So pretty!
00:06:51.208,00:06:54.583,- What are these vegetables?
00:06:54.625,00:06:57.542,- Bell peppers!
00:06:57.583,00:07:00.208,They're soooo pretty.
00:07:00.250,00:07:07.333,"Look at all the colours, meow-meow! I see yellow, and green, and red, and even orange!"
00:07:07.375,00:07:09.250,- Wow!
00:07:09.291,00:07:11.792,Do bell peppers ring like bells?
00:07:11.834,00:07:15.542,"- Yeah, the peppers don't really ring like bells, right, meow-meow?"
00:07:15.583,00:07:19.750,- Right. They don't ring. See?
00:07:19.792,00:07:22.166,They just look like bells.
00:07:22.208,00:07:25.792,"Want to pick eight bell peppers for us to try, Katerina?"
00:07:25.834,00:07:28.875,"- OK! Daniel, meow-meow, you come too!"
00:07:28.917,00:07:31.000,- Will you count the peppers with us?
00:07:31.041,00:07:32.625,OK!
00:07:32.667,00:07:35.875,"One, two..."
00:07:38.583,00:07:40.834,"- Five, six..."
00:07:40.875,00:07:43.625,- Oooh! Green too!
00:07:43.667,00:07:46.000,"Seven, eight!"
00:07:47.750,00:07:51.250,"We picked all the colours, meow-meow!"
00:07:51.291,00:07:57.000,"- Excellent! Let's wash these bell peppers first, then we'll cut them up into slices."
00:07:59.500,00:08:02.709,"Katerina, would you like to try first?"
00:08:13.083,00:08:15.250,"OK, I'll try it."
00:08:19.458,00:08:22.125,It tastes... good.
00:08:22.166,00:08:24.750,Crispy and sweet.
00:08:24.792,00:08:27.750,Meow-meow!
00:08:27.792,00:08:30.542,I want to try ALL the bell peppers now!
00:08:30.583,00:08:35.166,"The yellow peppers, orange peppers, and green."
00:08:35.208,00:08:39.500,Meow-meow! Peppers are my new favourite!
00:08:39.542,00:08:42.417,Can I try a cherry tomato too?
00:08:42.458,00:08:43.834,"- Why, sure."
00:08:45.834,00:08:48.041,- Mmm!
00:08:48.083,00:08:51.500,"I like the squirty tomatoes, meow-meow!"
00:08:51.542,00:08:54.125,- How about a carrot while you're trying?
00:08:56.875,00:08:58.875,- Hmm...
00:08:58.917,00:09:01.500,These carrots are too crunchy for me.
00:09:01.542,00:09:04.542,- It's OK if you don't like it.
00:09:01.542,00:09:06.750,You should feel proud that you gave all of the veggies a try.
00:09:06.792,00:09:12.667,- I did. I tried.
00:09:12.709,00:09:17.208,- How about we make a big vegetable salad for snack?
00:09:17.250,00:09:20.166,"- With lots of bell peppers, meow-meow!"
00:09:20.208,00:09:23.500,- Vegetables taste good!
00:09:55.959,00:10:29.917,"they're juicy and they're - Ahem. Excuse me, are you going to finish your carrots?"
00:10:29.959,00:10:32.959,I think they're deeeeelicious!
00:10:33.000,00:10:34.959,"- You can have mine, Miss Elaina."
00:10:35.000,00:10:37.542,I will trade you for more bell peppers.
00:10:37.583,00:10:40.083,Does anybody else have bell pepper for me?
00:10:40.125,00:10:42.542,They are yummy in my tummy!
00:10:42.583,00:10:48.208,"Tomorrow, I want to try a bell pepper sandwich, and a bell pepper spaghetti, and bell pepper pizza!"
00:10:48.250,00:10:50.375,I like trying new things!
00:10:53.375,00:10:56.750,- Which foods do you want to try?
00:10:56.792,00:10:58.917,I hope they taste good!
00:10:58.959,00:11:00.709,Ugga-mugga!
00:11:07.917,00:11:09.500,"- Hi, neighbour!"
00:11:09.542,00:11:12.792,You're just in time to come on an adventure with me!
00:11:12.834,00:11:15.959,Tigey is coming too!
00:11:16.000,00:11:18.875,Ha! Ha! Ha! Let's go play!
00:11:18.917,00:11:23.166,We're playing adventure in my pretend cave! See?
00:11:23.208,00:11:28.834,"Let's tiptoe, and we have to be very, very quiet."
00:11:28.875,00:11:30.625,Shh.
00:11:30.667,00:11:34.083,Hey... wait a minute.
00:11:34.125,00:11:38.709,There's somebody in my cave. Dad?
00:11:38.750,00:11:40.709,"Dad, what are you doing?"
00:11:40.750,00:11:45.375,- I'm not Dad.
00:11:45.417,00:11:47.500,- A silly beast?
00:11:47.542,00:11:49.792,We've never played that before.
00:11:49.834,00:11:53.125,- I know. It's new.
00:11:53.166,00:11:55.667,Will you play with me?
00:11:58.917,00:12:02.125,"Oh, silly beeeast."
00:12:02.166,00:12:05.417,Where are you?
00:12:05.458,00:12:07.875,Gotcha! Woo-hoo!
00:12:11.250,00:12:13.709,- Did you like playing my new game?
00:12:13.750,00:12:17.125,- I did! I like that silly beast game.
00:12:17.166,00:12:19.709,- Me too. It was fun.
00:12:19.750,00:12:24.250,"- Oh, hello in there-ere-ere."
00:12:24.291,00:12:27.542,"- So, how's my adventure tiger doing?"
00:12:27.583,00:12:29.166,- Grr-ific!
00:12:29.208,00:12:32.291,"Dad was a silly beast, and I found him!"
00:12:32.333,00:12:35.917,- A silly beast?
00:12:38.959,00:12:45.208,Want to take a break from your adventure and help me in the kitchen?
00:12:45.250,00:12:49.959,"- OK, let's see what we'll need."
00:12:47.709,00:12:52.208,"- Oooh, whatcha making?"
00:12:50.000,00:12:55.083,"- Well, since Miss Elaina is coming over for dinner tonight..."
00:12:55.125,00:12:58.542,- Yay!
00:12:58.583,00:13:02.208,"Yes, well, I'm making something new for dessert."
00:13:02.250,00:13:05.291,It's called Banana Swirl.
00:13:05.333,00:13:09.375,- Banana Swirl? What's that?
00:13:11.959,00:13:16.208,- Brr! They're cold!
00:13:16.250,00:13:20.625,"And now, we put them in the blender, like this."
00:13:20.667,00:13:22.625,And put the top on.
00:13:26.542,00:13:29.083,Here we go. Ready?
00:13:29.125,00:13:31.291,- Whoa!
00:13:31.333,00:13:34.458,- Aaaaaand... stop!
00:13:34.500,00:13:37.041,- They don't even look like bananas anymore!
00:13:37.083,00:13:41.125,- Nope! Now it's Banana Swirl!
00:13:41.166,00:13:44.250,Can you... taste it and tell me what you think?
00:13:44.291,00:13:48.041,- Taste it? But...
00:13:48.083,00:13:50.917,"- Well, you tried a new game today."
00:13:50.959,00:13:53.500,Can you try a new food too?
00:13:57.959,00:14:01.583,It might even taste...
00:14:06.542,00:14:10.959,"OK, I'll try it and see if Banana Swirl tastes good."
00:14:11.000,00:14:14.959,"- That's the spirit! Daniel, we can taste it together!"
00:14:15.000,00:14:17.500,Ready?
00:14:17.542,00:14:20.083,- Hmm. Swirly...
00:14:20.125,00:14:22.750,banana-y...
00:14:22.792,00:14:25.291,it's cold...
00:14:25.333,00:14:28.500,hmm... and sweet.
00:14:28.542,00:14:31.500,It kind of tastes like...
00:14:31.542,00:14:35.542,banana ice cream!
00:14:35.583,00:14:39.458,- Mmm! I'm glad.
00:14:39.500,00:14:42.333,"And I'm glad you tried something new, Daniel."
00:14:42.375,00:14:45.875,- Me too! Banana Swirl tastes goooooood!
00:14:45.917,00:14:48.625,- Sure does!
00:14:48.667,00:14:52.792,It will be a great dessert after the veggie spaghetti we're having for dinner.
00:14:52.834,00:14:55.083,- Veggie spaghetti?
00:14:55.125,00:14:58.208,- You want to see?
00:14:58.250,00:15:06.834,"- Here's the spaghetti, and these veggies go on top of the spaghetti to make it..."
00:15:06.875,00:15:10.583,"- Hmm... I've never had veggie spaghetti before, you know."
00:15:10.625,00:15:13.834,- I know. It'll be something new to try.
00:15:13.875,00:15:17.458,I hear the doorbell.
00:15:17.500,00:15:19.250,- Miss Elaina!
00:15:19.291,00:15:22.583,"- Bye, Mom! Hiya, toots!"
00:15:22.625,00:15:25.000,"Mom, do we have time to play before dinner?"
00:15:25.041,00:15:27.375,- Sure. I'll call you when dinner's ready.
00:15:27.417,00:15:29.500,- Come on!
00:15:29.542,00:15:35.125,Let's play adventure!
00:15:29.542,00:15:38.041,We need to find the silly beast that's in the cave!
00:15:38.083,00:15:40.542,We've never played that game before.
00:15:40.583,00:15:44.125,What if I don't like it?
00:15:40.583,00:15:46.875,"- Well... I think if you try it, you'll like it."
00:15:44.166,00:15:49.291,It's very fun and VERY silly.
00:15:49.333,00:15:52.834,- Oh. I do like silly things.
00:15:52.875,00:15:58.166,I'll try it. Let's go get that silly beast!
00:15:58.208,00:16:02.291,"We have to be very, very quiet."
00:16:04.959,00:16:07.083,- I'LL GO IN FIRST!
00:16:07.125,00:16:09.250,first!
00:16:12.083,00:16:14.834,- Um... I found the silly beast!
00:16:14.875,00:16:18.125,It's Tigey! Grrrrr!
00:16:18.166,00:16:21.917,- Ha! Ha! Ha!
00:16:21.959,00:16:26.083,"Hey, what if Tigey was the silliest beast ever?"
00:16:26.125,00:16:28.083,Want to make believe with me?
00:16:28.125,00:16:30.917,Let's make believe...
00:16:30.959,00:16:35.083,"that Tigey is a silly, silly beast!"
00:16:45.375,00:16:49.875,Ha! Ha! Ha!
00:16:49.917,00:17:10.375,and make you giggle - Wasn't that grr-ific?
00:17:06.333,00:17:13.875,"- Will all the silly beasts wash up and come for dinner, please?"
00:17:15.959,00:17:19.291,- Yeah!
00:17:25.500,00:17:27.500,- Yay!
00:17:27.542,00:17:29.875,- For you.
00:17:29.917,00:17:32.917,For Dad Tiger...
00:17:32.959,00:17:36.458,Here's some veggie spaghetti for you.
00:17:36.500,00:17:38.875,And some veggie spaghetti for Daniel.
00:17:43.125,00:17:47.125,- Um... Mom? I don't like veggie spaghetti.
00:17:47.166,00:17:50.500,"- But, Daniel honey, you've never even tried it before."
00:17:50.542,00:17:53.583,"- No, I haven't tried veggie spaghetti."
00:17:53.625,00:17:59.500,- So then how do you know you don't like it if you don't try it?
00:17:59.542,00:18:02.917,I don't know.
00:18:02.959,00:18:07.959,"- Huh? Well, toots, in my house, we say..."
00:18:17.125,00:18:19.500,I'll try veggie spaghetti.
00:18:19.542,00:18:24.083,Hmm... mmm...
00:18:24.125,00:18:28.500,"It's kind of crunchy, munchy..."
00:18:28.542,00:18:30.667,with squirty tomatoes!
00:18:30.709,00:18:32.709,I like it!
00:18:32.750,00:18:34.667,Veggie spaghetti is good!
00:18:34.709,00:18:37.458,"Right, Miss Elaina?"
00:18:37.500,00:18:39.500,- Um... no.
00:18:39.542,00:18:42.583,Veggie spaghetti is not my favourite.
00:18:42.625,00:18:45.291,Do you think I can just have plain spaghetti?
00:18:45.333,00:18:50.083,"- OK, plain spaghetti for you, and a little salad on the side, OK?"
00:18:50.125,00:18:52.333,- Thanks.
00:18:52.375,00:18:56.500,Ooh! Carrots!
00:18:56.542,00:19:00.458,And I'm glad I tried the veggie spaghetti.
00:19:00.500,00:19:02.542,- Me too!
00:20:07.959,00:20:11.417,- Mmm!
00:20:11.458,00:20:16.166,- And now for our special dessert made by Daniel!
00:20:16.208,00:20:19.333,- Banana Swirl!
00:20:19.375,00:20:22.917,- Banana Swirl? Ha! Ha!
00:20:22.959,00:20:25.083,It doesn't even look like bananas!
00:20:25.125,00:20:28.000,But it looks smushy-yummy!
00:20:28.041,00:20:29.625,Ha! Ha! Ha!
00:20:29.667,00:20:33.041,- Mmm... Banana Swirl?
00:20:33.083,00:20:37.250,I've never had that before.
00:20:41.250,00:20:44.166,"- OK, OK."
00:20:44.208,00:20:47.166,I'll try Banana Swirl!
00:20:47.208,00:20:50.333,Mmm! It IS smushy-yummy!
00:20:50.375,00:20:51.834,I'm glad I tried it!
00:20:51.875,00:20:54.667,- Mmm! Me too!
00:20:54.709,00:20:56.291,"Mmm, yummers!"
00:20:56.333,00:20:57.959,- Yummers!
00:21:00.000,00:21:06.792,- I liked trying a new silly beast game and new Banana Swirl and new veggie spaghetti!
00:21:06.834,00:21:10.041,Do you ever try new things?
00:21:10.083,00:21:14.208,"I like trying new things, especially when I'm with you."
00:21:14.250,00:21:18.041,Ugga-mugga.
00:22:00.750,00:22:02.750,Because it's you I like.
00:00:51.375,00:00:53.375,"- Hi, neighbour! Guess what?"
00:00:53.417,00:00:58.959,Dad is taking me and my friends with him to work at the clock factory.
00:00:59.000,00:01:00.625,Yay!
00:01:00.667,00:01:05.083,"At the clock factory, we get to see the clocks that my dad makes!"
00:01:05.125,00:01:08.500,And we get to ride Trolley there! Come and play!
00:01:08.542,00:01:11.208,"Trolley, please take us to the clock factory!"
00:01:11.250,00:01:13.458,"Ding, ding!"
00:01:13.500,00:01:15.834,"- Trolley, will you bring Daniel to breakfast?"
00:01:15.875,00:01:20.083,"- Ding, ding! Trolley coming to breakfast now! Ding, ding!"
00:01:24.792,00:01:29.041,"- I can see that you're excited, but I need you to sit down and be calm."
00:01:29.083,00:01:32.208,"- OK, Trolley. I have to go eat breakfast now."
00:01:32.250,00:01:34.709,- That's right.
00:01:32.250,00:01:37.041,There's a time to play and a time to be calm and eat.
00:01:37.083,00:01:39.542,- OK. I love oatmeal!
00:01:39.583,00:01:42.583,"With blueberries! Mmm, mmm!"
00:01:45.792,00:01:52.000,Ha! Ha! I'm excited to go to the clock factory with my friends! Yeah!
00:01:52.041,00:01:57.750,"- I see that you're excited, but I need you to sit down and be calm so you can eat your breakfast."
00:01:57.792,00:02:01.709,- But I'm so excited to go to the clock factory!
00:02:01.750,00:02:03.083,"Cha, cha, cha!"
00:02:03.125,00:02:05.792,"- Well, when you need to be calm..."
00:02:13.458,00:02:15.750,Ahhh. You try.
00:02:22.834,00:02:24.542,Ahhh.

00:02:30.000,00:02:31.709,- But I'm still excited.
00:02:31.750,00:02:33.709,- I'm excited too!
00:02:33.750,00:02:38.625,"In fact, I've been making a new clock, and I'm going to need you to help me finish it."
00:02:38.667,00:02:41.291,- Really? What kind of clock is it?
00:02:47.875,00:02:51.166,Mmm. I'm all done!
00:02:51.208,00:02:54.875,- Yes! Ha! Ha! I've been waiting all morning!

00:03:01.041,00:03:03.333,"Hi, Trolley!"
00:03:03.375,00:03:06.291,I'm really excited to go to work with you.
00:03:06.333,00:03:12.417,"I love seeing all the clocks YOU make, especially the tiger clock!"
00:03:12.458,00:03:15.583,Tick-tock! Tick-tock!
00:03:15.625,00:03:19.542,I'm a tiger clock!
00:03:19.583,00:03:24.500,"- Uh, Daniel, Trolley won't go unless we're buckled up and calm."
00:03:24.542,00:03:29.166,- But I'm a tiger clock!
00:03:29.208,00:03:33.000,"- OK. Now, remember what we can do to get calm?"
00:03:33.041,00:03:35.417,- Yes. Will you do it with me?
00:03:42.959,00:03:44.792,Ahhh.
00:03:44.834,00:03:48.125,- Trolley doesn't move until you are seated and buckled in.
00:03:48.166,00:03:50.625,- We're safe to go!
00:04:02.542,00:04:04.083,"- Hi, O! Hi, Katerina!"
00:04:04.125,00:04:06.083,"- Hi, Daniel!"

00:04:43.792,00:04:46.583,"Come on, Dad! Let's go inside and get to work!"
00:04:46.625,00:04:48.959,"- OK, let's go."
00:04:49.000,00:04:50.709,In we go!
00:04:50.750,00:04:52.375,"- Thank you, Mr. Tiger!"
00:04:52.417,00:04:55.000,- Meow-meow.
00:04:55.041,00:04:58.375,- Wow! My dad made all these clocks!
00:04:58.417,00:05:02.125,See? He made this one to look like the tree house.
00:05:02.166,00:05:05.291,- Hoo-hoo!
00:05:05.333,00:05:08.166,- And he made this one like Prince Wednesday's castle!
00:05:10.583,00:05:14.834,- And this one is my favourite.
00:05:14.875,00:05:18.667,Tiger clock! Tick-tock!
00:05:18.709,00:05:21.834,- Your dad MADE that?
00:05:21.875,00:05:26.125,"- Ooh. I wonder how it works, hoo-hoo."
00:05:26.166,00:05:28.208,- Clocks are tiger-tastic.
00:05:28.250,00:05:31.709,"Hey, do you want to make believe with me?"
00:05:31.750,00:05:33.959,Let's make believe...
00:05:34.000,00:05:38.583,that we can play inside all the clocks!
00:05:42.000,00:05:44.959,- Wow!
00:05:47.917,00:05:50.417,- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
00:05:54.000,00:05:57.333,- Tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock!
00:05:59.750,00:06:02.291,- Woo-hoo! Whoa!
00:06:13.375,00:06:15.834,- Wasn't that grr-ific?

00:06:25.000,00:06:30.458,"- Daniel, Katerina, O, I want to show you this clock that I'm making."
00:06:30.500,00:06:32.709,- Me too! Meow-meow!
00:06:32.750,00:06:34.458,Tick-tock! Tick-tock! Tick!
00:06:34.500,00:06:36.458,I'm going to need your help making this clock!
00:06:36.500,00:06:39.792,- Is it... a Daniel clock?
00:06:39.834,00:06:42.709,- Tick-tock-tick! Twirl!
00:06:42.750,00:06:49.750,"- Everyone, I need you to be calm so you can help me finish making this clock."

00:07:14.333,00:07:18.125,"OK, everyone."
00:07:18.166,00:07:22.542,"First I start with a circle, and then I put clock numbers on it."
00:07:22.583,00:07:26.333,"- Twelve numbers. Twelve numbers on a clock, right, Dad?"
00:07:26.375,00:07:32.333,"- That's right. I already put on numbers one through eight, but I need your help finishing the rest."
00:07:32.375,00:07:35.834,Can you all count with me and stick on the numbers?
00:07:35.875,00:07:37.583,- Hoo-hoo!
00:07:37.625,00:07:41.041,Nine...
00:07:41.083,00:07:44.458,- Eleven...
00:07:46.917,00:07:49.166,We call this the clock face.
00:07:49.208,00:07:52.041,"But it doesn't look like a real face, does it?"
00:07:52.083,00:07:54.834,"- Mmm, no!"
00:07:54.875,00:07:56.792,"- Clock face, hoo-hoo!"
00:07:56.834,00:07:59.542,- And these are the clock hands.
00:07:59.583,00:08:01.834,"- But they don't look like real hands, do they?"
00:08:01.875,00:08:07.166,"- No, they don't, but they DO point to the numbers to help us tell time."
00:08:07.208,00:08:11.125,"The little hand goes on the clock, and the big hand goes on the clock."
00:08:11.166,00:08:12.875,- Meow-meow!
00:08:15.291,00:08:17.083,- See these?
00:08:17.125,00:08:20.166,- Gears make the clock hands move!
00:08:20.208,00:08:25.959,- Yes. These gears are what make the clock hands move and tell the right time.
00:08:26.000,00:08:28.458,- Meow-meow!
00:08:26.000,00:08:33.542,"- Now I'm going to put this clock face into the rest of the clock, and then it will be done."
00:08:33.583,00:08:36.542,- Grr-ific!
00:08:36.583,00:08:38.625,- OK... here it is!
00:08:38.667,00:08:42.250,- It's Trolley!
00:08:42.291,00:08:45.917,- Isn't that clock tiger-tastic?
00:08:45.959,00:08:48.166,- That's right!
00:08:48.208,00:08:51.667,"Oh, it's almost chime time!"
00:08:51.709,00:08:53.667,"- Meow-meow, what's chime time?"
00:08:53.709,00:08:56.542,"- Hoo-hoo, I've never seen chime time!"
00:08:56.583,00:08:58.375,- You're gonna love it!
00:08:58.417,00:09:01.083,- Chime time! It's chime time!

00:10:11.750,00:10:13.792,- What?
00:10:13.834,00:10:17.417,- Time to play and be silly!
00:10:17.458,00:10:19.417,- Hurray!
00:10:17.458,00:10:21.667,"- Meow-meow, I want to play chime time!"
00:10:21.709,00:10:24.083,- I'll be the Trolley clock!
00:10:24.125,00:10:26.208,Tick-tock-tick!
00:10:26.250,00:10:28.583,"- Let me go for a ride, Trolley clock!"

00:10:46.959,00:10:51.917,I'm glad you came to the clock factory with me.
00:10:54.417,00:10:58.750,Thanks for helping me be calm.
00:10:58.792,00:11:00.792,Ugga-mugga.
00:11:07.667,00:11:11.417,"Oh, hi, neighbour!"

00:11:15.875,00:11:18.125,Story time! Story time!

00:11:20.375,00:11:23.458,Story time! Story time!
00:11:23.500,00:11:26.417,"- Daniel, Trolley isn't a place to be silly."
00:11:26.458,00:11:28.041,We need to be safe.
00:11:28.083,00:11:30.291,Trolley can't go until you're calm.
00:11:30.333,00:11:33.750,- But I'm excited about story time!
00:11:33.792,00:11:37.583,"Trolley, let's goooo!"
00:11:37.625,00:11:40.208,- Trolley can't go until you're calm.
00:11:40.250,00:11:43.041,- How can I be calm when I'm so excited?
00:11:43.083,00:11:46.083,- Try this with me: when you need to be calm...
00:11:49.333,00:11:52.417,- Mm-hmm.
00:11:54.875,00:11:57.458,Ahhh.
00:12:01.250,00:12:04.208,"- OK, how do you feel?"

00:12:07.000,00:12:09.208,"- Well, good."
00:12:09.250,00:12:12.083,and calm while we're on Trolley.
00:12:12.125,00:12:15.458,"OK. Trolley, we're ready to go."
00:12:26.041,00:12:28.250,- There's Prince Wednesday!
00:12:28.291,00:12:31.625,Let's go and say hi!

00:13:45.041,00:13:48.417,"Can I, Dad?"
00:13:45.041,00:13:51.667,"- Oh, um, hmm, indeed, Prince Wednesday, you can play for a little while longer out here."
00:13:51.709,00:13:54.208,We'll meet you inside.
00:13:54.250,00:13:58.500,"- Ribbit! Story time, story time, story time!"
00:13:58.542,00:14:05.166,"- Daniel, it was fun being a frog with Prince Wednesday, but the library is a place to be quiet and calm."
00:14:05.208,00:14:09.125,- But I'm still feeling hop-hop-hoppy! Ribbit!
00:14:09.166,00:14:12.208,"- Well, then, do you remember what you can do to get calm?"

00:14:45.041,00:14:47.667,- Oh. I'm excited for story time.
00:14:47.709,00:14:51.458,- Me too. Let's go ask Uncle X what story we're reading.
00:14:51.500,00:14:54.625,He's the librarian.

00:17:45.333,00:17:49.542,Story time is a time to be quiet and calm.
00:17:49.583,00:17:52.083,- But... then when is it time to be silly?
00:17:52.125,00:17:57.875,"- After the story, we'll go outside, and that's a time you can be silly."
00:17:57.917,00:18:00.542,- But... but I feel silly now.
00:18:00.583,00:18:04.166,"- Well, I know a way to help your body get calm."

00:18:49.375,00:18:51.291,- ...and took him back to his mama.

00:01:35.750,00:01:38.083,It's my special watch from my dad.

00:04:46.625,00:04:49.542,- But it's such a big mess!
00:04:49.583,00:04:53.709,"- Well, if you clean up together, you'll be done in no time at all!"

00:05:27.959,00:05:31.500,There's got to be some food in here somewhere.
00:05:31.542,00:05:34.583,"Oh, food! Where are you?"
00:05:34.625,00:05:38.000,"- Hoo-hoo. Your toys are getting everywhere, Daniel."

00:05:44.709,00:05:47.667,- Nifty-galifty!
00:05:47.709,00:05:52.500,"- Let's feed piggie first, so he doesn't try to run away again!"
00:05:52.542,00:05:54.500,"O, what do pigs eat?"
00:05:54.542,00:05:58.291,- Want to know what animals eat?
00:05:58.333,00:06:00.542,The pig eats corn.
00:06:00.583,00:06:02.583,The horse eats carrots.

00:06:37.917,00:06:39.667,"Oh, there it is."

00:06:46.875,00:06:51.250,- Hmm. I don't have any grass.
00:06:51.291,00:06:53.500,"Nom, nom, nom!"

00:07:01.333,00:07:04.291,"- Oh, good. Well, how about a snack for YOU then?"
00:07:04.333,00:07:06.291,"Farmers have to eat too, you know!"
00:07:08.125,00:07:10.875,"- Daniel, where's your watch?"
00:07:10.917,00:07:13.291,- Where IS my watch?
00:07:13.333,00:07:16.458,I always wear it right here!
00:07:16.500,00:07:18.709,I have to find my watch.
00:07:18.750,00:07:23.709,"It is so, so, so special to me."
00:07:23.750,00:07:26.083,- Ohhh.
00:07:26.125,00:07:28.125,"- Well, here's what I think."
00:07:28.166,00:07:34.083,"I think your watch is here somewhere in your room, but it's so messy you can't find it."
00:07:34.125,00:07:37.250,- It IS pretty messy in here.
00:07:37.291,00:07:39.458,"- Yeah, it is."
00:07:39.500,00:07:43.291,I don't see it anywhere!
00:07:43.333,00:07:45.291,So what should we do?
00:07:45.333,00:07:49.208,"- Well, we should clean up this messy mess so we can find it."
00:07:54.333,00:07:59.709,"If we work together, it will be easier to find your watch."
00:07:59.750,00:08:02.417,- You'll help me look for my watch?
00:08:08.000,00:08:10.792,- Cleaning up is actually kind of fun!
00:08:10.834,00:08:16.583,You can help by looking for my watch while we clean up. OK?
00:08:16.625,00:08:19.750,Our farm is getting cleaner!
00:08:25.792,00:08:29.083,- Do you see my watch yet?

00:08:45.792,00:08:52.000,"With everything so clean, it was easier to see where my watch was."
00:09:58.041,00:10:01.208,- All right!
00:10:01.250,00:10:03.875,Shall we go have our farmer snack now?
00:10:03.917,00:10:05.875,O's Uncle X will be here soon to pick him up.
00:10:05.917,00:10:08.125,- All right!
00:10:08.166,00:10:10.125,- What do you think farmers eat for snack?
00:10:10.166,00:10:11.750,"- Hoo, I don't know."
00:10:11.792,00:10:16.417,- Mm-mm! I bet farmers would like this snack.
00:10:16.458,00:10:20.458,"- Oh, yes, it's yummy."
00:10:20.500,00:10:22.875,I like playing farm animals with you.
00:10:22.917,00:10:25.875,- Me too. And thanks for helping me clean up.

00:10:34.917,00:10:36.625,"- Bye, Farmer O!"
00:10:36.667,00:10:39.083,It was fun playing farm with O.
00:10:39.125,00:10:42.709,"The table is kind of messy, Mom."

00:11:55.834,00:12:01.917,- I guess it's still a little windy from our windstorm last night.
00:12:01.959,00:12:05.375,- But now it looks like the leaves are dancing!
00:12:05.417,00:12:08.333,"- They're twirling, meow-meow!"

00:13:17.500,00:13:19.959,- We can't play on the jungle gym.

00:15:46.834,00:15:51.792,"Ha! Ha! Hey, do you want to make believe with me?"

00:04:42.250,00:04:45.166,Jungle tigers probably never need to sleep.
00:04:45.208,00:04:49.166,- I'm sure Daniel Tigers definitely need to sleep.

00:06:20.041,00:06:23.917,And to Tigey.
00:06:27.208,00:06:30.500,Tigey's not here!
00:06:33.166,00:06:35.875,"Oh, you're right."
00:06:35.917,00:06:38.125,- I can't go to bed without Tigey!
00:06:38.166,00:06:40.125,Do you know where Tigey is?
00:06:40.166,00:06:42.917,- No. Do you know where he is?
00:06:42.959,00:06:46.875,- No! Mom and Dad would always know where Tigey is!
00:06:46.917,00:06:49.792,I wish Mom and Dad were here.

00:07:05.000,00:07:09.792,"- And even though I'm not your mom and dad, I am royally good at looking for things."
00:07:09.834,00:07:12.083,What do you say?
00:07:12.125,00:07:14.959,- OK.
00:07:17.959,00:07:20.542,- Hmm... let's think.
00:07:20.583,00:07:24.375,Where was the last place you had Tigey?

00:08:20.875,00:08:23.458,- That they taste yummy?
00:08:23.500,00:08:30.333,Heyyy... do you think the cake still tastes yummy even though it's smushy?

00:16:24.500,00:16:26.291,- That's not good!
00:16:26.333,00:16:29.125,"- So, we can't play kick the ball on our picnic?"

00:16:53.166,00:17:04.542,But... you know what I always say: A squashed ball is bad.
00:17:04.583,00:17:06.834,- Yes. Now...
00:17:10.542,00:17:13.500,What's good about a squashed ball that you can't even kick?
00:17:13.542,00:17:17.959,"- Well... what else could you do with a squished, squashed, splat ball?"
00:17:18.000,00:17:23.667,"- Um... We can't kick it, so... we could..."

00:02:10.417,00:02:13.375,Let's dress up as knights.
00:02:15.959,00:02:18.166,"- Yes, Prince Wednesday?"
00:02:18.208,00:02:20.291,- Do you know where my knight costumes are?
00:02:20.333,00:02:23.375,- Well I believe they're in your dress up trunk.
00:02:23.417,00:02:26.750,- I'll help you look.
00:02:26.792,00:02:30.834,"- Wow! Ah, look at this! Cool!"
00:02:30.875,00:02:32.834,"- You're going to be a knight too. Right, Chrissie?"
00:02:32.875,00:02:35.083,- Yup!
00:02:35.125,00:02:37.083,"Chrissie, do you need any help getting up?"
00:02:37.125,00:02:38.834,- Could you hand me my crutches please?
00:02:38.875,00:02:40.834,- Of course.
00:02:43.083,00:02:45.041,- OK.
00:02:45.083,00:02:48.417,- Chrissie...
00:02:48.458,00:02:52.208,- Oh! These are my braces.
00:02:52.250,00:02:55.959,"- She just does, OK?"
00:02:56.000,00:03:00.542,"My legs can't walk on their own, so the braces help me walk."
00:03:00.583,00:03:03.667,- Your braces help you walk?
00:03:03.709,00:03:06.166,"- Yep! So, I'm just like you."
00:03:06.208,00:03:11.792,I just walk a little differently It's how I was born.
00:03:11.834,00:03:17.166,"- So, if we play together, my legs won't need braces too, will they?"
00:03:17.208,00:03:20.291,"- No, even if you get very, very close to Chrissie."
00:03:20.333,00:03:23.458,- Yeah! See? Rrrrreally close!
00:03:23.500,00:03:26.125,"- Too close, Wednesday!"
00:03:26.166,00:03:29.667,- Can I touch your braces?
00:03:29.709,00:03:32.291,- Sure. It doesn't hurt me.
00:03:32.333,00:03:36.583,- Wow! The braces feel kind of... smooth!
00:03:36.625,00:03:39.417,- Do you wear the braces all the time?
00:03:39.458,00:03:46.041,"- Not all the time. Not when I sleep or take a bath, but most of the time."
00:03:46.083,00:03:49.208,- You go to school?
00:03:49.250,00:03:51.542,"- Yeah, we do!"
00:03:49.250,00:04:16.834,"- I like to say, - You walk differently from each other, but you are the same in other ways, like you all go to school and you all like to play."
00:04:16.875,00:04:21.750,"We all have things that are the same, and things that are different."
00:04:29.709,00:04:33.291,- So... do you like to play pretend?
00:04:33.333,00:04:35.542,- I love to play pretend!
00:04:35.583,00:04:37.959,It's my favourite favourite.
00:04:38.000,00:04:40.917,"- It's my favourite favourite, too! Ha! Ha!"
00:04:40.959,00:04:43.792,- You have the sa-a-ame favourite! Ha! Ha! Ha!
00:04:43.834,00:04:48.375,"- So, if you both like to pretend, can we do it now?"
00:04:48.417,00:04:50.792,- OK!
00:04:50.834,00:04:52.709,- Hmm...
00:04:52.750,00:04:54.458,Here! You be the knights...
00:04:54.500,00:04:56.875,I'm going to be...
00:04:56.917,00:05:00.417,a dragon! Roaaaaar!
00:05:02.458,00:05:05.166,"- Here, Chrissie, I can help you walk to the table."
00:05:05.208,00:05:09.542,"- Thanks, but my braces help me walk, so I can do it myself."
00:05:09.583,00:05:11.834,"- Oh, OK!"
00:05:17.583,00:05:20.959,Thanks!
00:05:21.000,00:05:23.000,- Are you knights ready to play? Roar!
00:05:23.041,00:05:25.375,- Careful!
00:05:25.417,00:05:27.291,- Huh?
00:05:27.333,00:05:33.208,"Sometimes I do need extra help, but I also like to do things for myself, just like you!"
00:05:55.583,00:05:58.709,- I need help!
00:05:58.750,00:06:01.750,- Ha! Ha!
00:06:04.000,00:06:06.250,- Well I'm ready to play!
00:06:06.291,00:06:10.166,"Look out, dragons, Knight Daniel is here!"
00:06:10.208,00:06:12.417,"- Giddyup, horsie!"
00:06:12.458,00:06:17.458,"Look out, dragons, make way for Knight Daniel!"
00:06:17.500,00:06:23.542,Oh.... wouldn't it be so fun to be a knight on a real horse?
00:06:23.583,00:06:26.583,I would ride so fast!
00:06:26.625,00:06:33.625,"Heeey, let's make believe that I was a knight riding my horse to my castle!"
00:07:08.625,00:07:12.583,- Wasn't that grrr-ific!
00:07:12.625,00:07:16.333,"Giddyup, horsie!"
00:07:16.375,00:07:19.959,- Sure.
00:07:20.000,00:07:23.792,- Really? How do you know?
00:07:23.834,00:07:26.542,And I ride them a lot.
00:07:26.583,00:07:29.792,"- This is me and my horse, Peaches. See?"
00:07:37.291,00:07:40.125,I like to ride on his back.
00:07:48.834,00:07:50.917,Chrissie and I both like horses.
00:07:50.959,00:07:53.250,- Rooooaaar!
00:07:53.291,00:07:57.166,Dragon is coming to the castle!
00:07:57.208,00:08:00.083,- Rooooaaar!
00:08:00.125,00:08:02.667,- After him!
00:08:02.709,00:08:05.166,- Rooooaarrrr!
00:08:05.208,00:08:06.917,- Rooooaarrrr!
00:08:05.208,00:08:09.583,"- Come on, Knight Chrissie, we have to go fast to catch the dragon!"
00:08:09.625,00:08:12.166,"- Daniel, I can't go as fast as you can."
00:08:12.208,00:08:14.875,- You can't go fast?
00:08:21.041,00:08:26.875,"- No, no, no, we don't have to stop playing, I like being a knight! I, I just need to play in a different way."
00:08:26.917,00:08:29.125,- What do you mean?
00:08:37.000,00:08:43.083,"So when you play knights, you run around."
00:08:43.125,00:08:47.417,- Roaaar!
00:08:47.458,00:08:50.583,- ...I stand and guard the castle!
00:08:50.625,00:08:54.041,"No dragons will get by me! No, siree!"
00:08:54.083,00:08:56.709,"- Oh, so you can still play with us."
00:08:56.750,00:08:59.458,You just play differently.
00:08:59.500,00:09:02.291,It makes me happy that we can play together.
00:09:02.333,00:09:05.542,- OK! Knight Chrissie will guard the castle.
00:09:05.583,00:09:08.709,- My braces are like my knight armor!
00:09:08.750,00:09:12.125,See? We can all be knights the same!
00:09:25.917,00:09:29.542,we are the same!
00:10:07.166,00:10:23.208,"big brown eyes, - Oh, kniiiights?"
00:10:23.250,00:10:27.166,Dragon is going to attack the castle! Rrrroar!
00:10:27.208,00:10:29.166,- Not while Knight Chrissie is here!
00:10:29.208,00:10:31.792,- And Knight Daniel too!
00:10:31.834,00:10:34.291,- And Knight Miss Elaina!
00:10:34.333,00:10:37.959,- Roar! Yeah? How are you going to stop me?
00:10:38.000,00:10:39.959,- Like... this!
00:10:40.000,00:10:41.959,- A hug!
00:10:42.000,00:10:44.000,- Not a hug!
00:10:44.041,00:10:47.583,- I like having Chrissie as a new friend!
00:10:47.625,00:10:52.000,What's the same with you and your friends?
00:10:52.041,00:10:55.291,What's different?
00:11:08.000,00:11:14.709,"- Hi, neighbour! Prince Wednesday's cousin Chrissie is visiting our class today."
00:11:14.750,00:11:17.250,- We're playing dress up.
00:11:17.291,00:11:19.875,- Yup! And I know just what I want to be.
00:11:19.917,00:11:22.083,Come see!
00:11:22.125,00:11:24.667,- Howdy!
00:11:24.709,00:11:27.083,"- Cowgirl, thank-you-very-much!"
00:11:27.125,00:11:30.542,"- Cowgirl, right!"
00:11:30.583,00:11:34.750,See my sheriff badge?
00:11:34.792,00:11:38.875,- You'll need a sheriff hat!
00:11:38.917,00:11:42.041,- I wonder what it would be like to be a real sheriff.
00:11:42.083,00:11:45.125,"Heeey, that gives me an idea!"
00:11:45.166,00:11:50.458,Let's make believe that I was a real sheriff.
00:12:21.834,00:12:24.625,- Wasn't that grrr-ific?
00:12:24.667,00:12:28.166,But I don't think I want to pretend to be a sheriff anymore.
00:12:28.208,00:12:30.750,I want to be something else.
00:12:30.792,00:12:35.166,Let's go riiiide into town!
00:12:35.208,00:12:38.375,"- You be the horse, toots, because you have a tail!"
00:12:38.417,00:12:41.125,- Oh yeah... just like a horse.
00:12:41.166,00:12:45.041,"- I know I have a tail, but can't you be the horse?"
00:12:45.083,00:12:47.583,"- Well, I don't have a tail, toots."
00:12:53.625,00:12:55.583,but I have a tail.
00:12:59.583,00:13:01.542,- Yeah! So can we play now?
00:13:01.583,00:13:03.917,"- Yeah! Come on, Daniel!"
00:13:03.959,00:13:07.375,- Um... no thanks.
00:13:10.625,00:13:12.750,- I don't want to play anymore.
00:13:17.250,00:13:20.959,How would you feel if you were different from your friends?
00:13:21.000,00:13:23.375,I'm feeling sad.
00:13:23.417,00:13:26.625,- Yippee!
00:13:26.667,00:13:35.250,"- Hey, Daniel, I saw you playing over there with Chrissie and Miss Elaina, but now you're not playing."
00:13:35.291,00:13:38.125,"- I'm feeling sad, Teacher Harriet."
00:13:38.166,00:13:40.750,- It's OK to feel sad. It's good to know how you are feeling.
00:13:40.792,00:13:43.291,"Tell me, so I can help you."
00:13:43.333,00:13:46.208,"So, why are you feeling sad?"
00:13:46.250,00:13:49.041,- I have a tail.
00:13:49.083,00:13:53.750,"- But Miss Elaina doesn't have a tail, and Chrissie doesn't have a tail, and..."
00:13:56.750,00:13:59.041,I'm different.
00:13:59.083,00:14:06.375,"- Daniel, the things that are different, like having a tail, are part of what make you... you."
00:14:23.125,00:14:26.000,But how am I the same?
00:14:26.041,00:14:28.959,"- Well, for one thing, we all have feelings."
00:14:29.000,00:14:32.375,"I feel sad sometimes, too."
00:14:32.417,00:14:35.375,What else is the same?
00:14:32.417,00:14:38.542,"- Well, that's something you can find out."
00:14:38.583,00:14:45.917,"- I want you to talk to all your friends and find out how each of you are the same, and how each of you are different."
00:14:45.959,00:14:48.500,- OK... I can do that.
00:14:48.542,00:14:51.166,"You'll come with me, right?"
00:14:51.208,00:14:53.250,Come on!
00:14:55.291,00:14:57.166,tallest tower in the world!
00:14:57.208,00:15:00.208,With a cherry on top! Ta da!
00:15:00.250,00:15:02.750,"Oops! Bye-bye, cherry. Ha! Ha!"
00:15:02.792,00:15:04.959,"Blocks are my favourite toy, let's do it again!"
00:15:07.417,00:15:09.959,- Thanks.
00:15:10.000,00:15:13.875,do you have a tail?
00:15:13.917,00:15:17.166,"- Yeah, I didn't think so, we're different."
00:15:17.208,00:15:20.500,- Why are you asking me that?
00:15:29.417,00:15:31.834,I want to know how we're the same.
00:15:31.875,00:15:34.375,- Hmmm... there must be something that's the same.
00:15:34.417,00:15:36.625,Here's another block for the tower.
00:15:36.667,00:15:39.542,- I like building with blocks.
00:15:39.583,00:15:43.458,"- Heeey, we both like building with blocks!"
00:15:43.500,00:15:45.625,- That's the same!
00:15:45.667,00:15:48.041,"- What is it, Daniel?"
00:15:48.083,00:15:50.542,- Woohoo!
00:15:50.583,00:15:54.834,"Look, Teacher Harriet, Prince Wednesday and I both like building with blocks."
00:15:54.875,00:15:57.125,That's the same!
00:15:57.166,00:16:00.125,- You do both love building with blocks.
00:16:00.166,00:16:01.875,Let's take a picture.
00:16:04.083,00:16:05.834,"Daniel, I see something different about us."
00:16:14.875,00:16:18.542,"And I have a tail, and you don't. That's different too."
00:16:27.125,00:16:33.041,- And the things that are different are part of what makes you... you.
00:16:33.083,00:16:35.417,- Yeah... and I like you!
00:16:35.458,00:16:38.458,"- Hold it right there, partner!"
00:16:38.500,00:16:42.625,I'm the sheriff.
00:16:42.667,00:16:45.417,- I'm just making sure that everyone is safe.
00:16:45.458,00:16:47.709,That's my job.
00:16:47.750,00:16:49.709,"Right, Chrissie?"
00:16:49.750,00:16:53.417,- Right! And I'm the cowgirl. Yee-haw!
00:16:53.458,00:16:56.583,- You do both love to pretend together.
00:16:59.417,00:17:01.500,"- Daniel, you like to pretend too."
00:17:01.542,00:17:05.000,- Oh yeah!
00:17:05.041,00:17:08.834,That's the same.
00:17:05.041,00:17:12.959,"But I still have a tail, and nobody else does, so I'm still really different."
00:17:13.000,00:17:18.500,- I'm different too. I wear these braces on my legs to help me walk.
00:17:18.542,00:17:20.583,"That's different, and people see it."
00:17:20.625,00:17:22.333,But it's one of the things that makes me... me.
00:17:22.375,00:17:25.041,- But it's not the only thing.
00:17:25.083,00:17:27.667,There are a lot of things that make you who you are.
00:17:27.709,00:17:31.417,There is only one person exactly like you.
00:17:31.458,00:17:36.500,"- If we were all the same, that would be no fun at all!"
00:17:36.542,00:17:38.500,- You know what?
00:17:36.542,00:17:42.875,"Let's take a picture of the way you two are different, because I think it's something exciting."
00:17:42.917,00:17:46.000,"- I want to be different too, toots."
00:17:46.041,00:17:48.375,I like being different!
00:17:48.417,00:17:51.917,I know... my skin is different from Chrissie's.
00:17:51.959,00:17:54.083,"- Good observation, Miss Elaina."
00:17:54.125,00:17:56.000,- My skin is brownish.
00:17:56.041,00:17:58.125,"- Oh, yeah!"
00:17:58.166,00:18:00.959,And mine is more pinky.
00:18:11.417,00:18:14.375,I know someone who has the same skin colour as you...
00:18:14.417,00:18:16.625,ME!
00:18:16.667,00:18:20.125,"- And I have a tail, don't forget, that's different too."
00:18:20.166,00:18:25.291,"- Heeeey, Prince Wednesday and I have something that's different too. Our hair!"
00:18:25.333,00:18:28.917,"Mine's curly and black, and Prince Wednesday's is straight!"
00:18:28.959,00:18:32.333,- And brown.
00:18:32.375,00:18:35.583,"Well... my hair is fur, and it's stripy."
00:18:35.625,00:18:40.166,"- Will you take a picture of all of our sames and differences, please?"
00:18:42.583,00:18:44.542,"- I feel happy too, toots."

00:20:28.417,00:20:31.291,We're the same!
00:20:28.417,00:20:33.750,"- We are the same except I'm a kitty, and you're a tiger."
00:20:33.792,00:20:37.542,"- Yup! Teacher Harriet, will you take a picture of our tails?"
00:20:37.583,00:20:39.667,- Don't forget about meee!

00:21:13.709,00:21:17.375,And I'm glad you're my friend too. Ugga-mugga.

00:02:38.667,00:02:40.959,- What do you think it is?
00:02:41.000,00:02:43.959,"- I don't know, but it's lumpy and bumpy..."
00:02:44.000,00:02:46.333,I'm scared!
00:02:46.375,00:02:48.667,- I'm... scared too.
00:02:48.709,00:02:50.667,- Mom! Dad!

00:02:57.250,00:03:00.875,- Oh my... I can see that you're scared.
00:03:00.917,00:03:04.250,"It's OK. I'm here, you're safe."
00:03:04.291,00:03:07.458,"And when there's something scary, you can..."
00:03:13.542,00:03:18.834,"- Do you think if we see what the lumpy bump is, we'll feel better?"
00:03:18.875,00:03:22.500,- OK. Let's go see what it is.
00:03:24.583,00:03:26.792,Help me pull back the covers.
00:03:29.458,00:03:32.583,three!

00:03:51.083,00:03:53.291,"- Thanks, Mom!"
00:03:53.333,00:03:57.166,"- Prince Wednesday, you sure do have a lot of stuffed animals."
00:03:57.208,00:03:59.583,- I know. Want to meet them?
00:03:59.625,00:04:02.041,- Huzzah!

00:04:46.000,00:04:47.959,"- Yup, yup!"
00:04:48.000,00:04:53.834,"- OK, but first, do you want to make believe with me?"
00:04:53.875,00:05:00.333,Let's make believe that all of the stuffed animals come alive and play with me!
00:05:35.333,00:05:38.041,- Wasn't that grrr-ific?
00:05:38.083,00:05:40.750,Better go brush my teeth!
00:05:43.291,00:05:47.291,Thank you!
00:05:47.333,00:05:49.792,"- I sing that, too!"

00:06:26.208,00:06:29.333,"Good night, Daniel."
00:06:32.750,00:06:35.125,It sure is dark in here.
00:06:35.166,00:06:38.500,Darker than my room at home.
00:06:38.542,00:06:41.166,Do you see that on the wall?
00:06:41.208,00:06:43.458,What is that?
00:06:43.500,00:06:47.125,- What?
00:06:43.500,00:06:50.125,- Look! I see something scary over there!
00:06:50.166,00:06:52.125,- Mom! Dad!
00:06:52.166,00:06:54.792,"- Heeey, hey, what's going on?"
00:06:54.834,00:06:58.166,Is everything OK?
00:06:58.208,00:07:00.417,"- Oh, I see."
00:07:00.458,00:07:02.917,"Well, should we see what it is... together?"
00:07:02.959,00:07:05.500,"- Yes, please.... together."
00:07:12.792,00:07:14.834,- See? Here are the spiky spikes!
00:07:14.875,00:07:19.875,"- I do see. OK, now, keep watching."
00:07:19.917,00:07:23.458,"- Ah! Hey, the spikes moved!"
00:07:23.500,00:07:26.625,- That's right!
00:07:23.500,00:07:29.750,That's because the scary thing you saw was... a shadow!
00:07:29.792,00:07:32.000,"Mr. Lizard's shadow, see?"
00:07:32.041,00:07:37.083,- Ohhh! The scary thing was Mr. Lizard's shadow!
00:07:37.125,00:07:39.834,That's not so scary!
00:07:46.333,00:07:50.792,"Now that we saw it was Mr. Lizard, I feel much better."
00:07:50.834,00:07:55.542,"Mr. Lizard, I royally command you not to scare us anymore!"
00:07:55.583,00:07:58.333,- I'm glad you're both feeling better.
00:07:58.375,00:08:03.834,"It's true, sometimes shadows can be scary, but if you look at them closely..."
00:08:06.834,00:08:09.417,I made a shadow animal!
00:08:09.458,00:08:13.208,- What animal is that?
00:08:13.250,00:08:17.041,Hop! Hop! Hop!
00:08:17.083,00:08:20.792,"- Ha! Ha! It does look like a bunny rabbit. You see, my fingers are the bunny ears. See?"
00:08:20.834,00:08:23.375,"OK, OK, here's another one."
00:08:23.417,00:08:26.291,- What animal is that?
00:08:29.875,00:08:32.625,- Is it a butterfly?
00:08:29.875,00:08:35.583,- Hmmm... it does look like a butterfly.
00:08:35.625,00:08:39.417,Or it could be a bird.
00:08:39.458,00:08:42.709,- You're right. Shadows are fun.
00:08:42.750,00:08:44.917,"- Alright, that's good."
00:08:50.000,00:08:52.208,- Yes.
00:08:54.250,00:08:57.000,"- Good night, sleep tight."
00:08:57.041,00:08:59.291,"- Good night, Sir Jumpy."
00:08:59.333,00:09:02.250,"Good night, Bananas."
00:09:02.291,00:09:05.583,and Mr. Lizard's shadow.
00:09:05.625,00:09:09.041,"Good night, Daniel."
00:09:09.083,00:09:12.208,I'm glad I know what to do if something scares me.
00:10:22.583,00:10:25.000,- Pssst! Daniel! Daniel!
00:10:25.041,00:10:26.917,I just wanted to show you.
00:10:26.959,00:10:29.041,"The moon is pretty, see?"
00:10:29.083,00:10:32.750,"- Oh, yeah! I see!"
00:10:36.667,00:10:38.667,"- Good night, Daniel."
00:10:40.625,00:10:43.333,"Good night, Bananas."
00:10:43.375,00:10:46.000,"Good night, Mr. Lizard..."
00:10:46.041,00:10:49.333,"And good night, moon."
00:10:49.375,00:10:53.250,I'm really glad you were with me on my sleepover.
00:10:53.291,00:10:56.041,I think I'm ready to go to sleep now.
00:10:56.083,00:10:59.458,"Good night, neighbour."
00:11:06.500,00:11:09.667,"- Hi, neighbour!"
00:11:09.709,00:11:13.625,"- Guess what? Tonight, we're going camping with my dad!"

00:14:50.291,00:14:52.583,"- Here, O, I'll help you take a look."
00:14:55.166,00:14:58.041,- Hoo-hoo! It's only a rock!
00:14:58.083,00:15:00.291,That's not scary! Phew!
00:15:00.333,00:15:02.792,I feel better... again!
00:15:02.834,00:15:05.041,"- I'm glad, because..."
00:15:05.083,00:15:07.583,we hiked all the way to...
00:15:09.834,00:15:12.041,...the camping tent!
00:15:12.083,00:15:14.834,- The tent!
00:15:14.875,00:15:17.917,"Campers, this is where we're sleeping tonight."
00:15:17.959,00:15:20.291,- We sleep... in here?
00:15:20.333,00:15:23.625,- That's right!
00:15:23.667,00:15:27.041,"- No, no, no, no. This is not how I sleep at home..."
00:15:27.083,00:15:30.208,"- Oh, I know it's different, O, but I'll be right here with you."
00:15:30.250,00:15:33.041,"Come inside, take a look."
00:15:33.083,00:15:34.917,"- I think you're going to like the tent, O!"
00:15:34.959,00:15:36.792,- Hoo-hoo!
00:15:36.834,00:15:39.500,- You come too!
00:15:43.166,00:15:46.458,- I guess this tent is nice.
00:15:46.500,00:15:49.166,Wait! Where's the potty!?
00:15:49.208,00:15:51.583,- There's no potty in a tent.
00:15:51.625,00:15:54.709,"Right, Dad?"
00:15:51.625,00:15:57.333,"- Right! If you have to use the bathroom, just tell me, and I'll take you inside the house."
00:15:57.375,00:16:00.166,- Oh... OK.
00:16:00.208,00:16:02.959,This is not like my room at home.
00:16:03.000,00:16:05.792,Wait! Where are the beds!?
00:16:05.834,00:16:08.542,"- O, there are no beds in a tent."
00:16:08.583,00:16:11.041,"Right, Dad?"
00:16:08.583,00:16:13.333,"- Right. We sleep in sleeping bags, O. See?"
00:16:13.375,00:16:15.458,"- This one's for you, see?"
00:16:15.500,00:16:17.458,Right next to mine!
00:16:17.500,00:16:19.583,- Oh... OK.
00:16:19.625,00:16:22.333,This is not like my room at home.
00:16:22.375,00:16:24.750,"- Hey, O... do you know who likes camping?"
00:16:24.792,00:16:27.000,- Who? Hoo-hoo!
00:16:27.041,00:16:30.125,- Tigey the Adventure Tiger!
00:16:30.166,00:16:33.000,- My favourite! Grrr!
00:16:33.041,00:16:35.000,Adventure Tigers are..
00:16:35.041,00:16:38.291,- Brave and strong! Grrr!
00:16:38.333,00:16:40.792,- Let's get him! Hoo-hoo!
00:16:40.834,00:16:43.750,"I'm the silly beast, but I'm the one who's scared!"
00:16:47.458,00:16:50.000,- We got you!
00:16:50.041,00:16:53.375,"- OK, OK, OK! You got me."
00:16:53.417,00:16:57.041,And you tired me out! Phew!
00:16:57.083,00:17:00.750,- Tigey the Adventure Tiger is brave and strong!
00:17:00.792,00:17:03.792,I want to be brave and strong like that!
00:17:03.834,00:17:07.000,Heeey! That gives me an idea!
00:17:07.041,00:17:09.959,Do you want to make believe with me?
00:17:10.000,00:17:12.208,Let's make believe...
00:17:12.250,00:17:17.458,that I was Tigey the Adventure Tiger going on a camping adventure!
00:17:43.750,00:17:46.959,the Adventure Tiger!
00:17:51.041,00:17:54.917,- Wasn't that grrr-ific?
00:18:00.583,00:18:02.458,- Ready!
00:18:02.500,00:18:07.500,This sleeping bag is not like my nest at home. Hoo-hoo!
00:18:07.542,00:18:10.875,But it's cozy!
00:18:10.917,00:18:15.000,"I kind of like it, and I think I like camping too!"
00:18:15.041,00:18:20.208,"- Ha! Ha! That's good to hear, O, very good to hear--- - Aaah!"
00:18:20.250,00:18:22.500,"- Daniel, are you OK?"
00:18:22.542,00:18:24.583,- I think it's something scary!
00:18:24.625,00:18:26.959,- Oh my!
00:18:27.000,00:18:29.750,- I'm scared.
00:18:32.709,00:18:35.125,- That's right!
00:18:37.792,00:18:39.875,So what do you think we should do?
00:18:42.625,00:18:46.041,"hiding is one idea, but what else could we do?"
00:18:46.083,00:18:49.667,- See what it is?
00:18:49.709,00:18:51.917,We can be brave like...
00:18:51.959,00:18:55.917,Tigey the Adventure Tiger! Hoo-hoo!
00:18:55.959,00:19:00.250,"- That's true, Tigey is brave and strong!"
00:19:03.500,00:19:05.709,"- Thanks, Dad!"
00:19:12.125,00:19:13.959,- Mom!
00:19:14.000,00:19:16.834,"- Daniel, it's your mom!"
00:19:16.875,00:19:19.917,"- Hi, campers!"
00:19:19.959,00:19:22.250,- Phew! I feel better!
00:19:22.291,00:19:25.083,- And I wanted to say good night to my campers!
00:19:25.125,00:19:27.750,"- Thanks, Mom!"
00:19:25.125,00:19:30.250,"Now that I see it was you, I feel better!"
00:19:52.458,00:19:55.375,It's a frog!
00:20:14.041,00:20:16.250,Ha! Ha! It's a rock!
00:20:36.417,00:20:38.125,"- Come on, Mom, come inside the tent!"
00:20:38.166,00:20:40.166,- Let's go! Ha! Ha! Ha!
00:20:40.208,00:20:43.208,- You're not scary. Hoo-hoo!
00:20:43.250,00:20:45.333,"- Gee, thanks."
00:20:45.375,00:20:48.959,- This camper is sleepy.
00:20:49.000,00:20:51.959,"- Me too. Good night, O."
00:20:52.000,00:20:54.000,"Good night, Mom and Dad."
00:20:54.041,00:20:56.083,- Good night.
00:20:56.125,00:20:58.959,- Good night.
00:20:59.000,00:21:02.166,- I like going camping.
00:21:02.208,00:21:05.583,"And I think O the Owl likes it, too."
00:21:05.625,00:21:10.959,"If you feel scared of something, you should ask a grown-up to help you see what it is..."
00:21:11.000,00:21:13.500,"you might feel better, like we did!"
00:21:13.542,00:21:17.917,"Good night, neighbour."
00:21:28.917,00:21:31.208,- Hi!
00:00:34.125,00:00:50.959,"on every street - Hi, neighbour. We're playing at Miss Elaina's house today."
00:00:51.000,00:00:56.709,"She lives in the museum-go-round, and she is a very fun friend."
00:00:56.750,00:01:00.000,Verrry fun.
00:01:00.041,00:01:03.458,I'm so glad you came to play.
00:01:05.166,00:01:07.750,"- Hi, Lady Elaine."
00:01:07.792,00:01:10.750,My neighbour came to play too.
00:01:10.792,00:01:13.792,- Miss Elaina has been waiting for you all day.
00:01:13.834,00:01:15.792,"- Greetings, Daniel Tiger."
00:01:15.834,00:01:19.333,"I'm so, so, so, so, so, so glad you're here!"
00:01:19.375,00:01:22.083,"- Wow, what's that on your head?"
00:01:26.750,00:01:28.959,- Astronaut! Whoa!
00:01:29.000,00:01:31.333,- And I'm going to zoom to outer space!
00:01:31.375,00:01:34.917,- Wow! I would love to zoom to outer space!
00:01:34.959,00:01:37.458,Can I be an astronaut too?
00:01:37.500,00:01:41.542,- You betcha. I even made you an astronaut helmet like mine.
00:01:41.583,00:01:44.166,Ready?
00:01:44.208,00:01:47.750,"Here comes one, here comes the other."
00:01:47.792,00:01:51.583,"Thanks, Miss Elaina."
00:01:51.625,00:01:54.750,- Astronaut power!
00:01:54.792,00:01:58.166,- Astronaut power!
00:02:05.041,00:02:10.125,- Zooooom.
00:02:10.166,00:02:13.709,- Zoom with me.
00:02:13.750,00:02:17.417,Zooooom.
00:02:26.583,00:02:29.333,- Welcome to... outer space!
00:02:29.375,00:02:35.125,- Whoa! Did you make all of this outer space stuff?
00:02:38.667,00:02:40.875,I made us this.
00:02:40.917,00:02:44.875,It's a telescope. We can use it to look at the moon and the stars. See?
00:02:44.917,00:02:49.291,I see a star...
00:02:49.333,00:02:51.458,and a Daniel star!
00:02:51.500,00:02:55.125,- I'm a shooting Daniel star.
00:02:55.166,00:02:58.834,Watch this. Whoooosh!
00:02:58.875,00:03:01.542,Whoosh! Whoa!
00:03:01.583,00:03:03.542,- Do you want to look through the telescope?
00:03:03.583,00:03:05.125,- Sure. Thanks.
00:03:05.166,00:03:07.500,"- Oh, wait, I want to look at one more thing."
00:03:07.542,00:03:09.125,- OK.
00:03:12.083,00:03:16.083,"- Oh, no! The telescope bent."
00:03:16.125,00:03:18.792,- We can't see anything through it.
00:03:18.834,00:03:22.333,- But... I wanted to use the telescope.
00:03:22.375,00:03:25.333,That was my idea.
00:03:25.375,00:03:26.750,Argh!
00:03:29.375,00:03:31.542,I'm upset.
00:03:31.583,00:03:33.750,Now we can't play anymore.
00:03:33.792,00:03:36.125,- Boomerang Toomerang!
00:03:39.041,00:03:43.542,"- Our telescope bent, and Miss Elaina is upset."
00:03:43.583,00:03:45.750,- Can you fix it?
00:03:45.792,00:03:48.333,"- Oh, it's too bent."
00:03:48.375,00:03:51.166,Hmm. Some things just can't be fixed.
00:03:51.208,00:03:56.959,"- Well, if we can't play with the telescope, then we can't play at all."
00:03:57.000,00:04:01.917,"I'm sorry your telescope is bent, but that doesn't mean you and Daniel can't play anymore."
00:04:01.959,00:04:04.959,- It doesn't?
00:04:10.792,00:04:15.959,"- Yes. Daniel is your friend, and he wants to play with you, not your things."
00:04:16.000,00:04:18.667,"- I do want to play with you, Miss Elaina."
00:04:18.709,00:04:20.834,It doesn't even matter what we do.
00:04:20.875,00:04:24.875,"- And I want to play with you too, even without a telescope."
00:04:24.917,00:04:27.250,"Daniel, do you want to play again?"
00:04:27.291,00:04:28.875,- Yes!
00:04:36.542,00:04:39.333,- A pretend telescope is a great idea!
00:04:39.375,00:04:41.959,"- Now, that's using your noodle!"
00:04:42.000,00:04:47.041,- Make a telescope with us.
00:04:47.083,00:04:51.709,- I see you tooooo.
00:04:53.375,00:04:57.208,"Hmm, where are-- Oh!"
00:04:57.250,00:04:59.625,- Woo! Yay!
00:04:59.667,00:05:01.875,- Woo! Ha! Ha! Ha!
00:05:08.083,00:05:11.917,"- Thanks, Daniel. I feel much, much, much, much, much better."
00:05:11.959,00:05:13.542,"And thanks, Mom."
00:05:13.583,00:05:17.458,"- Well, that's what I'm here for, toots. Zoom!"
00:05:19.083,00:05:23.625,"- Ooh, what's this big box?"
00:05:23.667,00:05:27.333,- That's our rocket ship!
00:05:27.375,00:05:30.625,- Whoa. I like the wings.
00:05:30.667,00:05:33.583,- Thanks. But the rocket ship isn't done yet.
00:05:33.625,00:05:37.000,"Let's colour it some more, OK?"
00:05:37.041,00:05:43.000,Cool!
00:05:46.542,00:05:49.500,- Great idea!
00:05:49.542,00:05:52.959,"- This looks like a real rocket ship, doesn't it?"
00:05:53.000,00:05:56.417,Zoom! Heyyy...
00:05:56.458,00:06:00.208,what if it WAS a real rocket ship?
00:06:00.250,00:06:03.125,Do you want to make believe with me?
00:06:03.166,00:06:05.375,Let's make believe...
00:06:05.417,00:06:09.750,that we could zoom in this rocket ship to the moon!
00:06:44.583,00:06:47.917,Wasn't that grr-ific?
00:06:47.959,00:06:51.792,"- Attention, Astronaut Daniel."
00:06:51.834,00:06:55.041,The rocket ship is all ready to go to space.
00:06:55.083,00:06:58.333,Now we count backwards to blastoff!
00:07:00.000,00:07:02.750,- Will you count backwards with us?
00:07:02.792,00:07:04.959,Let's start at five.
00:07:05.000,00:07:11.125,"two, one..."
00:07:11.166,00:07:12.709,Blastoff!
00:07:12.750,00:07:14.500,- Zooooooom.
00:07:14.542,00:07:17.208,- Zooooooooooom.
00:07:17.250,00:07:18.625,- Zoooom...
00:07:18.667,00:07:20.875,Waaaa!
00:07:20.917,00:07:24.542,"- Grr. We zoomed a lot, huh, Miss Elaina?"
00:07:24.583,00:07:26.750,Miss Elaina?
00:07:26.792,00:07:29.542,"- Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no."
00:07:29.583,00:07:31.542,- The wing ripped off of our rocket ship!
00:07:31.583,00:07:35.166,Now the rocket ship is ruined.
00:07:35.208,00:07:38.959,Now we can't play outer space.
00:07:39.000,00:07:42.208,"- But, Miss Elaina, I still want to play."
00:07:42.250,00:07:46.959,"- Well, we can't. No rocket, no outer space, no play."
00:07:47.000,00:07:49.458,"- But, Miss Elaina, remember?"
00:07:49.500,00:07:52.250,We don't have to play with a rocket ship.
00:07:57.667,00:08:02.166,"But, but, but I wanted us to play outer space in a rocket."
00:08:02.208,00:08:08.041,"- I know, but I just want to play with you, even if there's no rocket ship."
00:08:08.083,00:08:15.500,"- Hmm... well, maybe we can pretend this box is... something else."
00:08:15.542,00:08:18.333,- OK. Hmm...
00:08:20.583,00:08:24.417,Hmm! You know what it kinda looks like?
00:08:24.458,00:08:28.500,It kinda looks like... a boat!
00:08:28.542,00:08:30.375,See?
00:08:34.000,00:08:36.000,"- A boat! I love it, toots!"
00:08:36.041,00:08:39.959,But... can it be a space boat?
00:08:40.000,00:08:43.750,'Cause I still want to go to outer space.
00:08:43.792,00:08:48.291,"- A space boat? I've never heard of that before, but I like it!"
00:08:54.542,00:08:59.250,- Let's count down backwards so we can blast off.
00:08:59.291,00:09:06.083,"two, one..."
00:09:06.125,00:09:07.750,Blastoff!
00:09:07.792,00:09:10.000,Weeeee!
00:09:10.041,00:09:14.875,- Look over there. I see stars.
00:09:14.917,00:09:18.291,- And I see...
00:09:18.333,00:09:22.625,"...space fish! Glup, glup, glup!"
00:09:22.667,00:09:27.709,"- Miss Elaina, I really just love playing anything with you."
00:09:41.375,00:10:30.375,"you, it doesn't really best time for friends you, it doesn't really - Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!"
00:10:49.000,00:10:52.333,- I liked playing outer space with Miss Elaina today.
00:10:52.375,00:10:56.333,What do you like to play with your friends?
00:10:56.375,00:11:00.291,"I like playing with you, friend."
00:11:03.375,00:11:05.792,"Hi, neighbour."
00:11:07.667,00:11:10.959,We're at Prince Wednesday's castle to play. Come on.
00:11:13.208,00:11:16.834,I'm going to ring their doorbell. Whoa!
00:11:16.875,00:11:19.375,Weeeee! Ha! Ha! Ha!
00:11:22.083,00:11:25.792,"- Ah! Daniel Tiger, I presume."
00:11:25.834,00:11:28.458,"- Hello, King Friday."
00:11:28.500,00:11:30.458,"- Hello, hello, hello!"
00:11:30.500,00:11:32.458,"- Hello, hello, friend Daniel Tiger."
00:11:32.500,00:11:34.834,"- Hello, hello, friend Prince Wednesday."
00:11:34.875,00:11:36.834,My neighbour is here too.
00:11:36.875,00:11:38.792,"- Hello, hello, hello."
00:11:46.959,00:11:52.250,- Wow! This is the purplest rock I have ever seen!
00:11:52.291,00:11:54.875,- I have lots of rocks in my collection.
00:11:54.917,00:11:57.333,Want to come up to my room and see all my rocks?
00:11:57.375,00:12:00.583,"- Oh, yes, that would be grr-ific!"
00:12:00.625,00:12:02.917,- On you go.
00:12:02.959,00:12:04.917,- Yay! Wow!
00:12:04.959,00:12:07.291,You have bunk beds?
00:12:07.333,00:12:10.792,- Cool!
00:12:10.834,00:12:13.166,- Double yep. Heh! Heh!
00:12:13.208,00:12:16.291,- What are those?
00:12:16.333,00:12:19.166,- Those are my knights.
00:12:19.208,00:12:23.208,- Really cool. Whoa!
00:12:23.250,00:12:25.083,"- Yep, yep."
00:12:25.125,00:12:29.792,"And I'm the king of the castle, and... I'm the boss of stuff."
00:12:29.834,00:12:31.792,- That's so funny!
00:12:31.834,00:12:34.875,- I can't wait to show you this.
00:12:34.917,00:12:38.333,Ta-da!
00:12:38.375,00:12:42.125,The new purple rock will go riiiiight here.
00:12:42.166,00:12:49.417,"And someday I'll find a gold rock, and it will go right here."
00:12:49.458,00:12:52.959,"- Oh, a gold rock would be special!"
00:12:53.000,00:12:56.542,- I know. I always wanted a gold rock.
00:12:56.583,00:13:00.041,- You already have so many rocks in your collection.
00:13:00.083,00:13:02.291,- My dad and I look for rocks wherever we go.
00:13:02.333,00:13:05.208,"- Ooh, you're like explorers."
00:13:05.250,00:13:08.125,- Ha! Ha! Ha!
00:13:16.250,00:13:18.250,- Jungle Beach?
00:13:18.291,00:13:21.208,- You could explore for rocks on Jungle Beach too.
00:13:21.250,00:13:25.375,"See, this rock is actually a piece of coral. From the sea!"
00:13:25.417,00:13:30.083,"- Wow, Prince Wednesday!"
00:13:30.125,00:13:33.041,- I know.
00:13:35.667,00:13:38.375,"Come on, rock explorer, let's play with your rocks."
00:13:38.417,00:13:40.000,- NO!
00:13:40.041,00:13:42.458,"No, we can't PLAY with the rocks."
00:13:42.500,00:13:46.667,- What? We can't play with the rocks? Why not?
00:13:49.083,00:13:51.625,- Oh. So we can't play.
00:13:53.875,00:13:56.000,- We can't play.
00:13:56.041,00:13:58.750,- Hmm...
00:13:58.792,00:14:02.208,"My, but the purple rock looks so good in your collection."
00:14:02.250,00:14:04.083,- Yeah.
00:14:06.959,00:14:10.083,But they are fragile; they might break.
00:14:10.125,00:14:13.250,"- Yeah, they could break."
00:14:13.291,00:14:15.583,- So we can't play at all.
00:14:17.834,00:14:20.041,"- Oh, I think you can still play."
00:14:20.083,00:14:22.250,You know what I always say?
00:14:28.041,00:14:33.500,- A friend doesn't need to play with your things; they just want to play with you.
00:14:33.542,00:14:36.291,- But Daniel wants to play with my rocks.
00:14:36.333,00:14:39.291,- I do want to play with your rocks.
00:14:39.333,00:14:41.750,But I want to play with you more.
00:14:45.041,00:14:48.208,"- Yes! How about we play something else, friend?"
00:14:48.250,00:14:51.041,"- OK, friend."
00:14:54.667,00:14:58.250,- Well done!
00:15:00.917,00:15:02.917,- Yes!
00:15:02.959,00:15:04.542,Call me if need me.
00:15:10.041,00:15:19.709,"- So, if we can't play with the rocks, how about we pretend to be explorers like you and your dad?"
00:15:25.041,00:15:27.250,- I'll crawl through the tunnel.
00:15:27.291,00:15:30.875,"- Whoa-ho-ho! Oh, are there treasures over there?"
00:15:30.917,00:15:33.291,- Nope.
00:15:33.333,00:15:36.542,- I think I see some treasures over here!
00:15:36.583,00:15:38.458,- Nope.
00:15:40.583,00:15:42.917,Can we play with him?
00:15:42.959,00:15:45.750,He's really special to me.
00:15:45.792,00:15:48.959,He goes here. But I don't want to play with him. Is that OK?
00:15:54.291,00:15:57.208,"Come on, let's keep exploring."
00:15:57.250,00:16:00.458,"- Oh, treasures, where are you?"
00:16:00.500,00:16:05.083,"- Come out, come out wherever you are. Ha! Ha!"
00:16:05.125,00:16:07.417,There's got to be some treasures over here.
00:16:18.166,00:16:21.875,"- Oooh, I wonder what's inside this treasure."
00:16:21.917,00:16:25.583,- Let's open it to find out.
00:16:25.625,00:16:28.375,Our treasure is a picture of you and me.
00:16:32.667,00:16:35.667,"- Hey, I have an idea."
00:16:38.500,00:16:40.709,Let's make believe...
00:16:40.750,00:16:43.625,that we are on a REAL treasure hunt.
00:17:19.667,00:17:22.083,Wasn't that grr-ific?
00:17:22.125,00:17:24.458,"- Come on, explorer!"
00:17:27.875,00:17:30.041,- Let's go!
00:17:30.083,00:17:33.834,Whoa!
00:17:33.875,00:17:37.291,- Looking royally hard.
00:17:44.834,00:17:47.250,"- You play too, OK?"
00:17:47.291,00:17:51.834,What do you spy that is red and tastes delicious?
00:17:54.458,00:17:56.709,Red strawberries!
00:17:56.750,00:17:59.041,- That's it.
00:17:59.083,00:18:01.834,Mmm! Deee-licious!
00:18:01.875,00:18:05.208,"- Nom, nom, nom."
00:18:05.250,00:18:09.834,Red strawberries are my fav-our-ite! Ha! Ha! Ha!
00:18:09.875,00:18:12.667,"Explorers, looking for treasures..."
00:18:12.709,00:18:15.709,- What treasure do I spy?
00:18:15.750,00:18:19.000,I spy something green and hoppy.
00:18:19.041,00:18:21.834,Do you see something green and hoppy?
00:18:26.125,00:18:28.875,- Woo! A green hoppy frog.
00:18:28.917,00:18:31.834,- That's it.
00:18:31.875,00:18:34.625,- So hop-hop-hoppy!
00:18:36.667,00:18:38.250,- Look over there!
00:18:38.291,00:18:41.417,"- Exploring, looking for treasures..."
00:18:41.458,00:18:43.792,"Looking, looking..."
00:18:45.792,00:18:49.542,"- Looking, looking... Oh."
00:18:49.583,00:18:52.375,I spy something special.
00:18:52.417,00:18:54.417,It's shiny and gold.
00:18:57.083,00:19:01.083,- A rock. A shiny gold rock!
00:19:01.125,00:19:04.250,I always wanted a gold rock for my collection!
00:19:04.291,00:19:07.125,- I'm glad we explored and found it together.
00:19:07.166,00:19:09.375,- I know!
00:19:09.417,00:19:11.875,You know what?
00:19:11.917,00:19:14.083,- I want you to have the gold rock.
00:19:14.125,00:19:16.083,- Me?
00:19:16.125,00:19:19.250,"- Yeah. You can start your own rock collection, friend."
00:19:19.291,00:19:23.500,- Wow. That would be grr-ific!
00:19:23.542,00:19:25.500,"Thank you, friend."
00:19:30.375,00:19:33.041,something else that's shiny and gold.
00:19:33.083,00:19:34.834,- Another gold rock?
00:19:36.875,00:19:38.834,- A gold crown?
00:19:42.917,00:19:45.834,- You were hiding.
00:19:45.875,00:19:49.834,So funny.
00:19:53.291,00:19:55.667,You know what?
00:19:55.709,00:19:59.041,- I like playing with you.
00:20:06.291,00:20:34.667,it doesn't really matter - Ha! Ha! Ha!
00:20:44.000,00:21:07.250,"it doesn't really matter - Hey, that was fun."
00:21:14.667,00:21:18.291,Ugga-mugga!
00:21:18.333,00:21:31.166,to play with family - Hi!

00:00:49.208,00:00:55.625,"It's me, Daniel Tiger, and today, it's Prince Wednesday's birthday."
00:00:55.667,00:00:59.750,"So when he comes, say Happy Birthday!"

00:01:56.792,00:01:59.709,Sneeze-ah...
00:01:59.750,00:02:02.625,"- When you cough or sneeze, use your elbow, please."
00:02:05.583,00:02:07.875,- Ahhh...
00:02:07.917,00:02:11.250,- Good work. Now let's wash up.
00:02:12.709,00:02:15.792,"Wash, wash, wash my hands."
00:02:15.834,00:02:18.125,And dry.
00:02:18.166,00:02:22.625,All clean. Ready to play now.
00:02:22.667,00:02:25.083,"- There, there we go."

00:02:55.291,00:02:58.667,"What do we need first, O?"
00:02:58.709,00:03:01.709,"For strawberry cake, we need, uh... strawberries! Hoo hoo!"

00:03:44.500,00:03:47.875,- Okay!
00:03:50.458,00:03:54.041,- I don't feel very well...
00:03:56.834,00:04:00.709,- I do feel a little sick.
00:04:00.750,00:04:03.875,- Hmm... It feels as though you may have a fever.
00:04:03.917,00:04:07.333,I think you need to go home so you can rest.
00:04:07.375,00:04:10.125,- But I don't want to go home!
00:04:10.166,00:04:13.750,I'm going to miss Prince Wednesday's birthday party!
00:04:13.792,00:04:17.792,I could go home later.
00:04:29.000,00:04:31.375,- Here.
00:04:35.625,00:04:39.375,Have you ever been sick?
00:04:39.417,00:04:42.333,I don't like being sick.
00:04:46.625,00:04:50.166,Teacher Harriet says I have to go home.
00:04:50.208,00:04:52.959,"- Oh no, meow meow."
00:04:53.000,00:04:55.959,- But you're going to miss my birthday party!
00:04:56.000,00:04:58.417,- And the strawberry birthday cake...
00:04:58.458,00:05:01.750,"Strawberries are your favourite, meow meow!"
00:05:01.792,00:05:04.750,- I know.
00:05:04.792,00:05:08.667,- Me too.
00:05:11.875,00:05:15.291,I'm sick.
00:05:15.333,00:05:18.875,"Come on, let's get you home."
00:05:18.917,00:05:22.667,Can't I stay just a little longer?
00:05:22.709,00:05:25.542,So I don't miss Prince Wednesday's party?
00:05:25.583,00:05:30.792,We're going to have strawberry birthday cake.
00:05:38.667,00:05:42.750,"- Happy Birthday, Prince Wednesday."
00:05:42.792,00:05:46.417,"- Thanks. Bye, Daniel."
00:05:48.750,00:05:50.583,- Feel better soon.
00:05:50.625,00:05:52.875,"- Take us home, please, Trolley."
00:05:52.917,00:05:55.625,- 'Cause I'm sick.
00:05:58.125,00:06:03.667,"Dad, I wish I didn't have to miss Prince Wednesday's birthday party."
00:06:03.709,00:06:10.208,"- I know, Daniel, but when you're sick, you need to rest so your body can fight the germs that are making you sick."
00:06:10.250,00:06:14.458,- Fight germs? Like a superhero fights the bad guys?
00:06:16.542,00:06:19.250,You are my Super Daniel.
00:06:19.291,00:06:23.667,- Mmm. I wish I really was a superhero that could fight germs.
00:06:23.709,00:06:27.291,Hey... Do you want to make believe with me?

00:06:36.208,00:06:42.291,"and want germs to go away, Super Daniel will save the day!"
00:06:42.333,00:06:44.917,Super Daniel hears someone is starting to cough!
00:06:44.959,00:06:48.917,Daniel flies through the crowd.
00:06:48.959,00:06:51.625,- Make sure you cough into your sleeve!
00:06:54.208,00:06:58.959,"and want germs to go away, Super Daniel will save the day!"
00:06:59.000,00:07:03.291,"All the townspeople give a big cheer, when they hear..."
00:07:03.333,00:07:07.458,- Wash your hands and keep the germs away!
00:07:09.709,00:07:13.667,- Wasn't that super-iffic?
00:07:13.709,00:07:17.291,I really wish I wasn't sick.
00:07:19.458,00:07:21.667,"- Thanks, Trolley."
00:07:21.709,00:07:25.250,"Daniel, I'd like you to eat a little something before you rest."
00:07:28.917,00:07:32.750,Tigey... Tigey. I'm sick.
00:07:32.792,00:07:35.709,- Here's some of Grand-Père's special soup.
00:07:35.750,00:07:38.917,This'll help your body stay strong so it can fight those germs.
00:07:38.959,00:07:41.166,- Thanks. Mmm...
00:07:41.208,00:07:44.917,Grand-Père's special veggie soup.
00:07:44.959,00:07:47.875,Mmm!
00:07:47.917,00:07:50.000,Mmm-mmm!
00:07:52.250,00:07:54.291,Broccoli in my tummy!
00:07:54.333,00:07:58.250,"- And here are is a strawberry treat, just for you."
00:07:58.291,00:08:00.250,- Strawberries!
00:08:00.291,00:08:03.917,Just like Prince Wednesday's birthday cake.
00:08:03.959,00:08:07.000,"Thanks, Dad."
00:08:11.041,00:08:14.041,"Okay, all done."
00:08:21.041,00:08:24.625,Super Tigey is going to fight the germs.
00:08:24.667,00:08:27.792,"- Daniel, you can play when you're better."
00:08:27.834,00:08:30.041,"Right now, you need to rest."
00:08:34.709,00:08:37.291,- Okay.
00:08:37.333,00:08:39.667,"Come on, Super Tigey."
00:08:47.583,00:08:53.834,"- Okay... one shoe, two shoes..."
00:08:58.375,00:09:00.834,Snuggle up.
00:09:00.875,00:09:03.291,All tucked in snug and tight.
00:09:03.333,00:09:06.041,"- Thanks, Dad."
00:09:06.083,00:09:08.083,I'm ready to rest now.
00:10:21.208,00:10:24.834,"- Hey, my favourite fuzzy guy, how are you feeling?"
00:10:24.875,00:10:28.000,- A little bit better.
00:10:28.041,00:10:34.625,"And... while you were resting, Mr. McFeely brought over a Speedy Delivery for you."
00:10:34.667,00:10:38.208,- For me?
00:10:38.250,00:10:42.959,Ooh! It's a card from my friends.
00:10:43.000,00:10:46.792,- It looks like they missed you too and want you to get better soon.
00:10:46.834,00:10:49.458,Ugga mugga.
00:10:49.500,00:10:53.417,It was hard being sick and missing Prince Wednesday's birthday.
00:10:53.458,00:10:56.375,Did you ever miss something when you were sick?
00:10:58.375,00:11:00.583,Ugga Mugga.
00:11:05.792,00:11:09.250,"Hi, neighbour! We're having a busy day at my house."
00:11:09.291,00:11:12.041,Everyone is working on something... even me!
00:11:12.083,00:11:14.208,Come see.
00:11:14.250,00:11:18.291,Mom's making invitations for Fruit Picking Day.
00:11:18.333,00:11:21.208,"- Hello, neighbour."
00:11:21.250,00:11:24.083,- That's when we pick fruit in the Enchanted Garden.
00:11:24.125,00:11:26.333,- Here we go!
00:11:26.375,00:11:28.875,- That's what the Enchanted Garden looks like.
00:11:28.917,00:11:31.417,That's where we're going to pick the fruit.
00:11:31.458,00:11:35.083,- I can't wait for Fruit Picking Day!
00:11:35.125,00:11:40.875,"- Well then, I'd better keep working on these invitations or no one will know to come, huh?"
00:11:40.917,00:11:44.041,- I'll leave you to it!
00:11:46.542,00:11:49.250,"- Daniel, are you cleaning up your toys?"
00:11:49.291,00:11:52.166,- Oh yeah! My job is cleaning up.
00:11:55.542,00:11:57.667,"Honk, honk!"
00:11:57.709,00:12:00.000,- Achoo!
00:12:00.041,00:12:04.709,"- Oh, thanks, Daniel."
00:12:04.750,00:12:07.417,- How's it going over here?
00:12:07.458,00:12:10.458,a lot... more... to...
00:12:10.500,00:12:14.583,Achoo!!! ...do.
00:12:14.625,00:12:18.208,That was a big sneeze!
00:12:20.709,00:12:23.542,"- You know, you've been sneezing a lot today."
00:12:23.583,00:12:27.125,And you look kind of...
00:12:27.166,00:12:30.417,- I can't seem... to... achoo!
00:12:30.458,00:12:33.583,...stop sneezing.
00:12:37.125,00:12:40.083,- Even moms get sick sometimes.
00:12:40.125,00:12:47.458,And what Mom needs to do right now is rest and take care of herself.
00:12:47.500,00:12:52.166,I have to finish these invitations and... achoo!
00:12:52.208,00:12:56.083,I promised Mr. McFeely I'd get them to him for Speedy Delivery... today.
00:12:56.125,00:13:03.083,"- There is a lot to do, but when you don't feel well, it's important to rest."
00:13:12.875,00:13:16.834,- But... who will finish making the invitations?
00:13:19.667,00:13:22.583,- We'll take care of everything.
00:13:22.625,00:13:24.792,Let me put this here for you.
00:13:24.834,00:13:27.875,All you have to do is rest.
00:13:38.417,00:13:41.542,"I'm not feeling well, so, it is good to lie down."
00:13:49.208,00:13:52.834,Although... I am kind of hungry.
00:13:52.875,00:13:55.625,I better fix myself some lunch.
00:13:55.667,00:13:59.417,"- Lunch is a good idea, but we'll take care of it."
00:13:59.458,00:14:03.166,"You need to rest. Right, Daniel?"
00:14:03.208,00:14:07.709,We'll take care of it!
00:14:07.750,00:14:11.083,"- Okay, let's wash up!"
00:14:11.125,00:14:13.333,- Lathering up...
00:14:13.375,00:14:15.375,"Bye-bye, germs!"
00:14:15.417,00:14:18.625,I'm washing you all away.
00:14:18.667,00:14:22.000,Wouldn't it be funny if we could see the germs go away?
00:14:22.041,00:14:25.875,Hey! Want to make believe with me?
00:14:25.917,00:14:30.750,Let's make believe that we get rid of all the germs!
00:15:03.542,00:15:07.250,I hope Mom's germs go away soon!
00:15:10.000,00:15:12.583,All clean!
00:15:12.625,00:15:15.792,"So, what should we make Mom for lunch?"
00:15:15.834,00:15:20.458,- How about Grand-Père's veggie soup and toast?
00:15:20.500,00:15:24.041,That should help Mom feel better.
00:15:24.083,00:15:26.208,Orange juice helps you stay healthy.
00:15:26.250,00:15:28.583,- Good thinking.
00:15:30.959,00:15:33.959,And Grand-Père's veggie soup.
00:15:34.000,00:15:37.250,"- Mmm, that looks so good!"
00:15:37.291,00:15:41.667,Here you go.
00:15:41.709,00:15:44.792,"Ahh, there we go."
00:15:47.041,00:15:49.625,The soup's almost done...
00:15:49.667,00:15:52.166,- Just a little Mrs. Salt...
00:15:52.208,00:15:56.083,And some Mr. Pepper.
00:15:56.125,00:16:00.250,"Okay... Hmm, and..."
00:16:00.291,00:16:03.625,- Mom's going to love it!
00:16:03.667,00:16:09.875,"Hey Dad, what if we brought Mom her lunch on the couch?"
00:16:09.917,00:16:14.083,Like a couch picnic?
00:16:14.125,00:16:16.792,I'll get a tray.
00:16:20.000,00:16:23.417,And... toast. There we go.
00:16:23.458,00:16:25.542,Tada!
00:16:25.583,00:16:28.625,We did such a good job!
00:16:28.667,00:16:31.792,I hope this helps Mom feel better.
00:16:31.834,00:16:35.709,One couch picnic coming right up!
00:16:35.750,00:16:39.792,"- Mom, guess what? We brought you a couch picnic!"
00:16:39.834,00:16:43.542,So you can rest and eat!
00:16:43.583,00:16:46.375,What a lovely idea!
00:16:46.417,00:16:49.208,"- Voilà, madame!"
00:16:46.417,00:16:52.834,Allow me to serve you Grand-Père's famous veggie soup and toast!
00:16:52.875,00:16:56.000,- And orange juice!
00:16:56.041,00:17:00.083,"- Mmm, delicious! Thank you."
00:17:00.125,00:17:04.166,"- Aw, you look pretty sick."
00:17:00.125,00:17:07.834,We'll let you eat and rest and Daniel and I will get started on those invitations.
00:17:07.875,00:17:11.208,- Thanks.
00:17:11.250,00:17:15.041,- Let's see...
00:17:15.083,00:17:17.583,"- Hey, Mom! What should we do first?"
00:17:17.625,00:17:21.375,"- Shh, Mom is resting."
00:17:21.417,00:17:24.250,Shh... Mom is resting.
00:17:24.291,00:17:27.208,- I bet we can figure out what to do.
00:17:29.917,00:17:32.208,"Hmm, where are the stickers?"
00:17:32.250,00:17:35.250,"- Mom, where are the stick..."
00:17:35.291,00:17:39.959,"- Shh, Mom is resting."
00:17:40.000,00:17:44.208,"- Ahh, good eye! Now let's see what Mom did so far."
00:17:44.250,00:17:46.834,"Looks like a pattern, with fruit!"
00:17:46.875,00:17:49.750,We just have to finish the pattern.
00:17:49.792,00:17:52.542,I'm going to need some help finishing the pattern...
00:17:52.583,00:17:54.542,Will you help me?
00:17:54.583,00:17:56.959,- Ready?
00:17:57.000,00:18:01.500,"Apple, strawberry, apple, strawberry..."
00:18:01.542,00:18:04.417,What fruit comes next?
00:18:08.625,00:18:11.667,Hmm... Apple!
00:18:11.709,00:18:14.750,There!
00:18:14.792,00:18:17.125,what comes after apple?
00:18:17.166,00:18:20.959,- Do you know what comes after apple?
00:18:21.000,00:18:23.375,Strawberry!
00:18:23.417,00:18:27.959,"Apple, strawberry. Tada!"
00:18:23.417,00:18:32.375,"- You figured out the pattern, and we finished the sticker borders. That's what I call tiger teamwork."
00:18:32.417,00:18:34.875,Tiger teamwork high-five!
00:18:34.917,00:18:38.166,- Looks like we're ready to stuff and stamp the envelopes.
00:18:38.208,00:18:41.583,- Can I stamp?
00:18:44.458,00:18:48.291,Stuffed and stamped!
00:18:52.375,00:18:55.375,- Terrific!
00:18:55.417,00:18:58.166,- Did I hear you say the invitations are finished?
00:19:00.291,00:19:03.041,Wait! You are Mom!
00:19:03.083,00:19:05.625,"Mom, the invitations are all done!"
00:19:05.667,00:19:09.500,"- Wow, you worked hard to finish these so fast."
00:19:09.542,00:19:12.834,Thank you.
00:19:12.875,00:19:18.000,"- Now, I'll just pop these in the mailbox so Mr. McFeely gets them in time."
00:19:18.041,00:19:21.208,"- Mom, want me to sing you a song?"
00:19:21.250,00:19:24.250,It'll help you rest.
00:20:36.542,00:20:40.041,"- Mom, I thought of one more thing to help you feel better."
00:20:40.083,00:20:43.542,Be right back!
00:20:43.583,00:20:47.750,- Tigey!
00:20:47.792,00:20:51.792,"I thought he'd make you feel better, too."
00:20:54.750,00:20:57.500,"You know, I think I'm ready for a nap."
00:20:57.542,00:21:01.583,- Moms take naps too!
00:21:03.834,00:21:07.166,Shh... Mom's resting.
00:21:07.208,00:21:10.750,Do you rest when you don't feel well?
00:00:50.834,00:00:53.834,"- Hi, neighbour!"
00:00:53.875,00:00:58.208,I've been waiting to play a game with you! Come on in!
00:01:00.083,00:01:03.250,"OK, guess what I hid under my blanket."
00:01:03.291,00:01:08.333,"You can ride on it, it's red, it says, Ding! Ding!"
00:01:11.041,00:01:13.709,It's Trolley!
00:01:19.375,00:01:22.667,"Hop on board, Tigey!"
00:01:22.709,00:01:25.250,"You say, Ding! Ding! too!"
00:01:25.291,00:01:27.375,Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!
00:01:27.417,00:01:30.583,Ding! Ding!
00:01:33.917,00:01:36.583,"- Hi, Daniel."
00:01:36.625,00:01:39.917,"Hi, Trolley. Are you picking me up to go to the doctor's office?"
00:01:39.959,00:01:42.667,- Ding! Ding!
00:01:42.709,00:01:45.250,Wait a second.
00:01:42.709,00:01:48.375,"Are we going to the doctor's office for real, or pretend?"
00:01:48.417,00:01:51.917,- For real. Remember?
00:01:48.417,00:01:54.417,"Today Dr. Anna will give you a check-up, and she's going to give you a shot."
00:01:54.458,00:01:58.291,- A shot? I don't want to get a shot.
00:01:58.333,00:02:02.041,"Next stop, my bedroom!"
00:02:10.959,00:02:13.834,"- Oh, my little Daniel."
00:02:13.875,00:02:16.834,Can we talk about this?
00:02:16.875,00:02:20.750,"- Grr, I don't want to get a shot. I'm scared."
00:02:22.375,00:02:27.333,"- Well, because a shot is medicine, and medicine helps you feel better when you're sick."
00:02:27.375,00:02:29.750,- But I'm not sick.
00:02:29.792,00:02:32.750,This type of medicine can keep you from getting sick.
00:02:32.792,00:02:36.959,"- Oh. But, can't I just drink the medicine?"
00:02:37.000,00:02:42.125,"- Well, sometimes you do drink medicine, that's true, but this medicine works better as a shot."
00:02:42.166,00:02:44.333,- Oh. Will it hurt?
00:02:44.375,00:02:51.041,"- Well, yes, but only for a little bit, and then it'll be over."
00:02:48.000,00:02:54.250,Here's your pretend doctor kit with a toy shot you can play with.
00:02:54.291,00:02:57.750,You know what I do when I get a shot?
00:02:57.792,00:03:02.083,"- Oh, yes, sometimes even grownups get shots."
00:02:57.792,00:03:11.333,"When I get a shot, I close my eyes and think about something that makes me happy, like the beach with you."
00:03:11.375,00:03:14.375,- That makes you feel happy?
00:03:14.417,00:03:19.458,"And when I think of something that makes me happy, it helps me feel less scared."
00:03:27.000,00:03:30.166,Something happy... Hmm...
00:03:30.208,00:03:33.709,Trolley! Trolley makes me happy.
00:03:33.750,00:03:38.583,I'm thinking about riding on Trolley through the neighbourhood.
00:03:38.625,00:03:40.583,- Do you feel a little less scared?
00:03:40.625,00:03:42.208,"- Hmm, I do."
00:03:42.250,00:03:45.625,- You know what might also make you feel better?
00:03:45.667,00:03:48.166,Do you want to pretend to be the doctor and give me a shot?
00:03:48.208,00:03:53.375,"- Oh, OK. I'm Dr. Daniel."
00:03:53.417,00:03:56.166,- Right here.
00:03:56.208,00:04:02.834,"- Hmm, I'm going to close my eyes and think of something happy, like the beach with Daniel."
00:04:07.250,00:04:08.792,"OK, that's it."
00:04:08.834,00:04:11.500,- It'll be over that fast?
00:04:11.542,00:04:12.875,"- Yes, it will."
00:04:14.959,00:04:17.333,"- Mm, just a little bit, but now it's over."
00:04:17.375,00:04:18.959,- Phew.
00:04:19.000,00:04:25.542,"- You know, Dr. Daniel, the way you're wearing your blanket, well, you look like a brave superhero."
00:04:25.583,00:04:27.417,"- Oh, yeah."
00:04:27.458,00:04:32.083,I DO look like a superhero.
00:04:32.125,00:04:34.000,"Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!"
00:04:34.041,00:04:37.125,"Hey, do you want to make believe with me?"
00:04:37.166,00:04:42.417,Let's make believe that I'm Super Daniel!
00:04:42.458,00:04:46.041,"- Oh, no!"
00:05:15.959,00:05:19.250,- Wasn't that grr-ific?
00:05:19.291,00:05:21.917,- It's time to go.
00:05:21.959,00:05:24.291,- Zoom!
00:05:24.333,00:05:30.083,"OK, Mom. Can I wear my Super Daniel cape to Dr. Anna's?"
00:05:30.125,00:05:31.959,"- Sure, Super Daniel."
00:05:32.000,00:05:36.291,"- Oops! Not without you, Tigey!"
00:05:36.333,00:05:38.709,Here comes Trolley.
00:05:40.959,00:05:45.166,"- Please take us to Dr. Anna's, Trolley."
00:05:45.208,00:05:47.750,"- Trolley, do you know what?"
00:05:47.792,00:05:53.333,"When I feel scared, I close my eyes and think about you, Trolley."
00:05:55.041,00:05:58.083,What's something that makes you happy?
00:06:00.583,00:06:02.166,Grr!
00:06:04.709,00:06:07.583,- We're at Dr. Anna's office.
00:06:10.250,00:06:12.208,- Hi!
00:06:12.250,00:06:13.375,- Hi there!
00:06:13.417,00:06:17.583,- Let's go say hi to the fishies!
00:06:17.625,00:06:21.166,"Hi, fishies."
00:06:21.208,00:06:24.959,- Super Daniel?
00:06:21.208,00:06:27.458,- Today I'm SUPER Daniel because I'm getting a shot.
00:06:27.500,00:06:30.208,- Daniel Tiger?
00:06:30.250,00:06:32.834,"- Good luck, Super Daniel!"
00:06:32.875,00:06:37.500,"Hi, Dr. Anna."
00:06:37.542,00:06:42.750,"- Well, Super Daniel, will you and your mom come back to my examination room now?"
00:06:42.792,00:06:46.750,"- OK. Oh, I feel nervous."
00:06:46.792,00:06:50.333,"All right, Super Daniel, can you hop up on the table?"
00:06:55.166,00:06:56.959,"- No, not yet."
00:06:57.000,00:07:00.333,First I need to make sure your body is healthy.
00:07:00.375,00:07:04.000,This is the checking part of your check-up.
00:07:04.041,00:07:06.375,- OK.
00:07:04.041,00:07:09.458,"- First, I need to check the part of your body that listens to things."
00:07:09.500,00:07:13.125,- What do we use to listen?
00:07:13.166,00:07:14.625,Ears!
00:07:14.667,00:07:16.208,- Ears!
00:07:19.083,00:07:21.375,Your ears look healthy.
00:07:21.417,00:07:25.208,"Now, I need to check the part of your body you use to taste."
00:07:25.250,00:07:28.667,- What do we use to taste?
00:07:28.709,00:07:30.667,Our mouths!
00:07:30.709,00:07:32.417,- Open wide.
00:07:32.458,00:07:34.750,Great!
00:07:34.792,00:07:36.709,Now I will take your temperature.
00:07:38.583,00:07:40.417,"OK, close."
00:07:40.458,00:07:46.917,Now keep this under your tongue and hold still until you hear the beep.
00:07:46.959,00:07:51.333,Good. This is another way I can tell your body is healthy.
00:07:53.750,00:07:58.959,"OK, Super Daniel, now it's time for your shot."
00:07:59.000,00:08:00.917,Which arm would you like me to use?
00:08:00.959,00:08:02.542,"- Um, This one."
00:08:02.583,00:08:04.959,- Can you roll up your sleeve for me?
00:08:05.000,00:08:09.333,- Dr. Anna? I'm still a little bit scared of getting my shot.
00:08:09.375,00:08:12.458,- I understand.
00:08:16.000,00:08:18.875,- Right.
00:08:22.750,00:08:24.875,I'm thinking of Trolley.
00:08:26.750,00:08:28.917,OK. I'm ready.
00:08:31.417,00:08:36.166,"Thinking a happy thought, happy thought, happy thought!"
00:08:36.208,00:08:39.166,"- OK, Daniel, it's all done!"
00:08:39.208,00:08:41.417,You did very well.
00:08:41.458,00:08:43.959,"- You were right, Mom!"
00:08:44.000,00:08:45.583,But I'm still glad it's over.
00:08:45.625,00:08:47.500,- And did thinking about Trolley help?
00:08:47.542,00:08:49.375,- It did help!
00:08:49.417,00:08:55.583,"- I'm glad. You know, you should feel very proud of yourself, Super Daniel. Ugga-mugga!"
00:08:55.625,00:08:59.333,- And I have the perfect bandage for your arm.
00:08:59.375,00:09:05.500,A superhero bandage for Super Daniel!
00:09:08.709,00:09:10.750,"Bye, Dr. Anna!"
00:09:10.792,00:09:12.792,- Buh-bye!
00:09:15.083,00:09:17.959,"- I was afraid, and it was all OK!"
00:09:18.000,00:09:19.583,- Ready?
00:09:21.667,00:09:24.333,"- Look, Trolley, I got a shot."
00:09:24.375,00:09:30.333,"But it's OK. I thought about something happy-- YOU, Trolley!"
00:09:30.375,00:09:34.166,And then getting a shot didn't feel so scary!
00:10:35.208,00:10:37.792,"- Mom, I feel proud of myself."
00:10:37.834,00:10:41.917,- That makes me so happy.
00:10:41.959,00:10:44.375,- 'Cause I'm Super Daniel!
00:10:44.417,00:10:48.709,- And I'm Super Mom!
00:10:48.750,00:10:51.375,- Getting a shot today wasn't so bad.
00:10:51.417,00:10:55.083,Thinking about something that makes me happy really helped!
00:10:59.500,00:11:01.250,Ugga-mugga!
00:11:06.959,00:11:10.166,"- Hi, neighbour!"
00:11:10.208,00:11:19.041,"- It's raining! So I like to wear my rain boots, and my raincoat, and my rain hat, and splash in the puddles!"
00:11:19.083,00:11:22.750,"Hi, O! Hi, Mr. Owl!"
00:11:22.792,00:11:26.000,"- Hoo-hoo! Hello, Daniel!"
00:11:31.250,00:11:33.208,- Yay!
00:11:33.250,00:11:35.792,- We're going to play in the rain!
00:11:35.834,00:11:39.166,- Rainy day play is so much fun!
00:11:39.208,00:11:46.875,"- Nifty-galifty day for the boys to play in the rain, but I'm ready to go back to my nice, dry nest."
00:11:46.917,00:11:51.291,"- OK, We'll see you later."
00:11:51.333,00:11:53.625,- Bye-bye!
00:11:53.667,00:11:56.375,- Hoo-hoo! Come on!
00:12:01.667,00:12:05.250,"- Look, O, I'm a frog!"
00:12:05.291,00:12:07.000,Ribbit!
00:12:07.041,00:12:10.625,- Nifty-galifty!
00:12:10.667,00:12:12.542,Ribbit. Ribbit!
00:12:15.375,00:12:19.500,You can make a big splash like this! Ready?
00:12:19.542,00:12:22.875,One... two... three!
00:12:22.917,00:12:24.500,Weeee!
00:12:24.542,00:12:26.959,- Hmm. OK. Hoo-hoo.
00:12:27.000,00:12:30.375,I think I can make a little splash. Watch.
00:12:30.417,00:12:33.000,"Splash, splash."
00:12:33.041,00:12:37.291,Let me try that one more time. Hoo-hoo.
00:12:37.333,00:12:41.291,One... two... three...
00:12:41.333,00:12:42.667,Wahoo!
00:12:42.709,00:12:44.750,- Whoa!
00:12:47.500,00:12:50.917,- HA! Ha! Ha!
00:12:50.959,00:12:55.458,"Hey, O! Want to jump in a puddle together?"
00:12:55.500,00:12:56.959,"- OK, hoo-hoo!"
00:12:57.000,00:13:00.458,- One... two... three...
00:13:00.500,00:13:02.458,- Weeeee!
00:13:02.500,00:13:06.500,- I love the rain!
00:13:16.333,00:13:18.041,- That was loud.
00:13:18.083,00:13:20.917,- Hoo-no. That's scary.
00:13:20.959,00:13:27.583,"- Time to come inside now, boys! OK, let's get you out of these wet things."
00:13:27.625,00:13:30.417,Here we go. Nice and dry.
00:13:30.458,00:13:32.417,"So, did you boys have fun?"
00:13:32.458,00:13:35.542,- Uh-uh.
00:13:35.583,00:13:40.125,"- We were playing, and then it got dark, and then it went BOOM!"
00:13:40.166,00:13:42.583,"- Oh, OK, OK."
00:13:42.625,00:13:45.333,Let's get you cozy in the living room so we can talk about this.
00:13:45.375,00:13:46.959,- OK.
00:13:47.000,00:13:50.000,Ah!
00:13:50.041,00:13:53.166,There's the boom again!
00:13:55.667,00:13:58.125,"Yeah, thunder can be loud during a rainstorm."
00:13:58.166,00:14:02.417,- I don't like thunder.
00:14:02.458,00:14:06.542,"- I know thunder is loud, but you're inside and safe."
00:14:06.583,00:14:09.333,"- I know, but thunder is scary."
00:14:09.375,00:14:11.417,- There's something I do when I'm scared.
00:14:11.458,00:14:13.917,- You get scared?
00:14:13.959,00:14:16.166,- Grownups get scared?
00:14:19.250,00:14:21.667,"- So, what do you do when you're scared?"
00:14:21.709,00:14:23.375,- When you're scared...
00:14:30.625,00:14:33.083,"- Whoa! Oh, no!"
00:14:33.125,00:14:35.834,- More thunder!
00:14:35.875,00:14:38.333,Try thinking of something happy.
00:14:38.375,00:14:40.583,- OK. I'll try.
00:14:46.000,00:14:48.458,"- OK, Daniel, what makes you happy?"
00:14:48.500,00:14:52.125,- Uh... playing with Tigey!
00:14:52.166,00:14:54.000,- Hoo-hoo.
00:14:54.041,00:14:57.125,Is it working?
00:15:00.166,00:15:02.208,"Come on, you try it, O."
00:15:02.250,00:15:04.917,Try thinking about something happy!
00:15:04.959,00:15:06.917,"- Hmm, let me think."
00:15:06.959,00:15:08.959,When you're scared...
00:15:12.542,00:15:16.875,What makes me happy?
00:15:20.333,00:15:22.709,"- Do you feel a little less scared now too, O?"
00:15:22.750,00:15:24.709,- Hoo-hoo. I do.
00:15:26.375,00:15:29.166,But I still wish the thunderstorm would stop.
00:15:29.208,00:15:33.583,Hoo-hoo.
00:15:33.625,00:15:36.291,"- You know, there are a lot of other good things about the rain."
00:15:36.333,00:15:37.917,- Like what?
00:15:37.959,00:15:40.917,- Hoo-hoo! Want to know more about rain?
00:15:40.959,00:15:43.000,There's a book for that!
00:15:43.041,00:15:50.291,"Rain makes trees grow, and rain makes grass grow, and rain makes flowers grow."
00:15:50.333,00:15:51.709,- Wow!
00:15:53.875,00:16:00.583,"Hmm, I wonder if all of the flowers and trees are really happy in the rain, because they're growing."
00:16:00.625,00:16:06.583,"Hey, do you want to make believe with me? Let's make believe..."
00:16:06.625,00:16:11.792,that the trees and the grass and everything are singing in the rain!
00:16:45.250,00:16:47.500,Wasn't that grr-ific?
00:16:47.542,00:16:52.792,"- OK, boys, What do you say? Are you ready to play right here in the house?"
00:16:52.834,00:16:55.041,- Yes!
00:16:55.083,00:16:57.417,"- OK, good."
00:16:57.458,00:17:00.291,Roar or hoo-hoo if you need me.
00:17:00.333,00:17:02.166,"- Thanks, Mom!"
00:17:02.208,00:17:06.125,- But I wish we were still splashing in the puddles.
00:17:06.166,00:17:08.375,- Me too.
00:17:08.417,00:17:12.917,Hey! Maybe we can pretend that these pillows are puddles.
00:17:12.959,00:17:14.792,"- Great idea, Daniel."
00:17:14.834,00:17:17.291,Hoo-hoo!
00:17:21.333,00:17:23.291,- I'm scared again.
00:17:23.333,00:17:25.000,"- Me too, hoo-hoo."
00:17:25.041,00:17:28.250,"- O, let's try what my mom said. OK?"
00:17:28.291,00:17:30.667,- O...K.
00:17:30.709,00:17:32.542,- When you're scared...
00:17:36.583,00:17:38.542,"- Are your eyes closed, O?"
00:17:38.583,00:17:40.417,- Hoo-hoo. My eyes are closed.
00:17:40.458,00:17:43.000,I'm thinking of reading books.
00:17:43.041,00:17:45.834,"Reading really makes me happy, hoo-hoo."
00:17:45.875,00:17:48.125,- I'm thinking about playing with Tigey.
00:17:48.166,00:17:50.959,Playing with Tigey makes me so happy.
00:17:52.959,00:17:54.750,- When you're scared...
00:18:00.583,00:18:04.750,And Tigey is roaring at the thunder! ROAR!
00:18:04.792,00:18:08.166,Tigey's so loud!
00:18:08.208,00:18:11.542,"Hey, O! I made Tigey roar at the thunder!"
00:18:11.583,00:18:13.542,"- Good idea, hoo-hoo."
00:18:13.583,00:18:15.917,- Do you want to keep playing?
00:18:15.959,00:18:17.667,- Grr-ific!
00:18:17.709,00:18:19.917,I'm gonna be a froggie again!
00:18:19.959,00:18:24.458,- Ribbit! Ribbit! Ribbit!
00:18:24.500,00:18:30.458,"- O, your Uncle X is here to take you home."
00:18:30.500,00:18:32.834,- It's time for us to go home and have dinner.
00:18:32.875,00:18:35.500,You boys can play again another day.
00:18:35.542,00:18:37.792,- It was great playing with hoo!
00:18:37.834,00:18:40.250,- Buh-bye! Watch this.
00:18:40.291,00:18:41.959,Rrrrribit!
00:18:42.000,00:18:44.667,- Ribbit!
00:18:44.709,00:18:46.875,- Ribbit to you too!
00:18:46.917,00:18:49.709,- Dad! Dad! Dad!
00:18:49.750,00:18:52.250,- How's my fuzzy little tiger doing?
00:18:52.291,00:18:59.959,"- Grr-ific. O and I played in the rain today, but then there was scary thunder, but I thought of playing with Tigey, and I wasn't so scared anymore!"
00:19:00.000,00:19:04.000,"- Wow, Daniel, sounds like a big day! I'm so proud of you."
00:19:04.041,00:19:06.333,- Thanks. I'm proud of me too.
00:19:06.375,00:19:07.917,Is it still raining?
00:19:07.959,00:19:10.500,- It sure is.
00:19:10.542,00:19:13.125,- Listen? To the rain?
00:19:13.166,00:19:16.750,- Uh-huh. Come on.
00:19:26.166,00:19:27.917,- The rain DOES sound like music!
00:20:49.208,00:20:53.250,"- You know what, Mom?"
00:20:53.291,00:20:55.959,- So do I.
00:20:56.000,00:21:01.834,"- Psst. I'm glad we played in the rain today, even though the thunder was scary."
00:21:05.083,00:21:10.291,"Playing with Tigey makes me happy, so thinking about that made me feel better."
00:21:10.333,00:21:14.125,What makes you happy?
00:21:18.041,00:21:30.583,to play with family - Hi!
00:22:00.500,00:22:02.500,Because it's you I like.
00:00:52.250,00:00:55.709,"Hi, neighbour."
00:00:55.750,00:00:57.709,Come and play with me.
00:00:57.750,00:01:01.375,This blanket can be my king robe!
00:01:01.417,00:01:07.667,I'm king of the castle and I'm going to sit on my...
00:01:07.709,00:01:09.917,pillow throne.
00:01:09.959,00:01:14.083,"Look, there's Prince Elephant."
00:01:14.125,00:01:18.166,"So, why are you at my castle, Prince Elephant?"
00:01:18.208,00:01:21.083,I came to tell you something important.
00:01:21.125,00:01:24.583,What is it?
00:01:24.625,00:01:27.166,Ah! Oh no! A dragon?
00:01:27.208,00:01:29.166,We have to scare him away.
00:01:29.208,00:01:34.625,Prince Wednesday can help us scare away the dragon.
00:01:37.500,00:01:39.959,We really need him.
00:01:40.000,00:01:41.959,Mom! Mom!
00:01:42.000,00:01:44.291,Can Prince Wednesday come over? Can he?
00:01:46.458,00:01:48.542,Tell me what you need.
00:01:46.458,00:01:54.458,"- I'm playing king of the castle with our neighbour, and we have to scare away a dragon, and we really, really need prince Wednesday's help."
00:01:54.500,00:01:56.709,So can he come over?
00:01:56.750,00:02:00.625,"- Oh, Daniel, Prince Wednesday can't come over today."
00:02:00.667,00:02:04.333,"- What? Prince Wednesday can't come over, why?"
00:02:04.375,00:02:07.291,- Because he's visiting his cousin Chrissie all day today.
00:02:07.333,00:02:11.375,- Grrr! But I wanted him to come over and play king of the castle.
00:02:11.417,00:02:13.542,"- Aww, I'm sorry."
00:02:15.834,00:02:19.792,"Look! This is you as a baby. You liked to play king then, too."
00:02:19.834,00:02:23.166,- Oh yeah!
00:02:23.208,00:02:30.875,I really wanted Prince Wednesday to come over.
00:02:32.959,00:02:35.583,"- Hey, maybe we can play the trumpet."
00:02:35.625,00:02:39.417,Maybe I can play a trumpet song that will make the dragon come out.
00:02:43.917,00:02:47.125,Hey! My trumpet's broken!
00:02:47.166,00:02:48.959,Hmmmm!
00:02:49.000,00:02:52.000,We need to go to Music Man Stan's shop to fix my trumpet.
00:02:52.041,00:02:55.041,We so need to! Mom!
00:02:55.083,00:02:58.000,"Mom, my trumpet, it's broken."
00:02:58.041,00:03:03.000,We need to go to Music Man Stan's to fix my trumpet.
00:03:03.041,00:03:05.291,- But we can't go to Music Man Stan's today.
00:03:05.333,00:03:07.291,- What?! Why can't we?
00:03:07.333,00:03:10.333,- Because Music Man Stan's shop is closed today.
00:03:10.375,00:03:12.750,- Closed?! Grrr!
00:03:15.875,00:03:18.417,Grrr...
00:03:26.834,00:03:33.166,"- Aw, Daniel... I know it feels like you can't do what you want to do."
00:03:30.583,00:03:36.792,And when you feel like that it means you're frustrated.
00:03:36.834,00:03:41.250,I am. I'm really frustrated.
00:03:41.291,00:03:46.375,"- Now, I'm sure there's something around here you can do. You just have to keep thinking."
00:03:46.417,00:03:49.125,- I can't! Grrr!
00:03:49.166,00:03:51.500,I'm too frustrated.
00:03:51.542,00:03:57.417,- Daniel...
00:04:01.333,00:04:07.917,"- Hmm, when you're frustrated, like I am because I can't do what I want to do..."
00:04:16.458,00:04:20.250,"Uh, Mom, will you help me?"
00:04:20.291,00:04:22.542,"- Thank you for asking me so calmly, Daniel."
00:04:22.583,00:04:24.792,I will help you.
00:04:24.834,00:04:26.792,Do you want an idea for something to do now?
00:04:26.834,00:04:30.458,"- Yes, please."
00:04:33.333,00:04:36.083,"Hi, fishies, are you hungry?"
00:04:39.333,00:04:42.291,Would you play king of the castle with me?
00:04:42.333,00:04:48.542,You can be princes and trumpet players of an underwater castle.
00:04:48.583,00:04:52.834,"Hey, that gives me an idea."
00:04:52.875,00:04:56.500,Do you want to make believe with me?
00:04:56.542,00:05:03.125,Let's make believe that I live with the fish in an underwater castle!
00:05:39.041,00:05:43.208,Wasn't that grrr-ific?
00:05:43.250,00:05:45.500,- OK... how are you feeling now?
00:05:47.709,00:05:50.291,But maybe you could play with me for a little while?
00:05:50.333,00:05:53.750,"- OK, I can do that."
00:05:56.834,00:05:59.667,Maybe we can play with the blocks?
00:05:59.709,00:06:01.875,- I would love to.
00:06:01.917,00:06:04.792,"What a wonderful idea, Daniel."
00:06:07.333,00:06:10.625,What do you want to make?
00:06:10.667,00:06:15.458,You can play too!
00:06:10.667,00:06:19.542,"And Tigey can be King Tigey, king of the castle!"
00:06:15.500,00:06:21.625,"- OK, you start and I'll help."
00:06:24.834,00:06:27.625,"- Ha! Ha! Mom, we're humming together!"
00:06:32.750,00:06:34.917,- So do I!
00:06:34.959,00:06:39.000,- Almost.
00:06:39.041,00:06:41.333,Look how tall we made the castle!
00:06:41.375,00:06:47.083,"OK, King Tigey, you should sit on the top because you're the king! Ha! Ha!"
00:06:47.125,00:06:49.333,King Tigey!
00:06:49.375,00:06:51.583,Uh-oh! He fell off.
00:06:51.625,00:06:53.875,- Here. Try again.
00:06:53.917,00:06:56.417,Oh!
00:06:56.458,00:06:58.792,Grrr!
00:07:01.083,00:07:05.291,"There! Don't fall again, King Tigey, OK?"
00:07:05.333,00:07:11.542,Ah! Grrrr! Why can't I get Tigey to stay on the castle like I want him to?
00:07:11.583,00:07:14.583,I'm so frustrated! Grrrr!
00:07:14.625,00:07:16.875,- Remember what we talked about?

00:07:43.834,00:07:46.792,"Whoops! Hmm, let me try that again."

00:07:54.000,00:07:56.834,- You knocked over Tigey's castle!
00:07:56.875,00:08:00.792,"- I'm sorry, Daniel."
00:08:08.625,00:08:11.041,"- Daniel, will you help me?"
00:08:11.083,00:08:13.083,- I'll help you!

00:17:49.291,00:17:52.458,And I want to carry it over there.
00:18:01.083,00:18:03.125,"- Take a step back, meow-meow?"
00:18:03.166,00:18:06.083,- So you can get calm-- - And solve the problem.
00:18:06.125,00:18:08.792,- Meow-meow... OK.
00:18:22.709,00:18:24.875,"- But, how?"

00:18:33.333,00:18:37.333,"- Thanks, meow-meow. But how can I carry the big tray?"
00:18:37.375,00:18:39.083,- Hmmm... It is a big tray.
00:18:39.125,00:18:41.333,- Hard to carry.
00:18:41.375,00:18:43.375,- Hmmm.
00:18:43.417,00:18:50.458,"Well, maybe it would be easier if you didn't carry the tray."
00:18:50.500,00:18:53.208,"No tray, meow-meow?"
00:18:53.250,00:18:56.166,- That's a good idea.
00:18:56.208,00:18:59.000,- I can hold the tray for you!
00:18:59.041,00:19:02.917,"OK, easy does it, meow-meow."

00:19:33.041,00:19:36.709,"Mmm, good spaghetti meatballs!"
00:19:36.750,00:19:39.583,"- Katerina, are you still frustrated?"
00:19:39.625,00:19:41.834,- I'm not frustrated anymore!

00:21:11.250,00:21:14.500,"Take a step back, and ask for help."

00:21:26.417,00:21:30.375,- Hi!

00:01:01.667,00:01:07.500,"I have my royal pail, and I have my royal shovel, and I'm ready for the beach."
00:01:11.000,00:01:16.250,"Swimmy-swim-swim. Hey, want to pretend to swim with me?"
00:01:16.291,00:01:19.125,Come on!
00:01:19.166,00:01:21.542,"Swim, swim, swim!"

00:01:27.041,00:01:32.750,"- Swim, swim, swim."
00:01:34.667,00:01:37.917,we are swimming with the fish in the deep blue sea.
00:02:10.125,00:02:13.083,- Wasn't that grr-ific?
00:02:13.125,00:02:16.291,"- Daniel, Daniel, Daniel!"
00:02:13.125,00:02:19.166,"When we get to the beach, I'm going to build a great big sandcastle!"

00:02:24.458,00:02:28.083,"- Oh, no."

00:02:33.166,00:02:35.333,We can't go outside if it's raining.
00:02:35.375,00:02:38.959,- Why not?
00:02:41.333,00:02:44.125,- I can't go outside to play on the beach?
00:02:48.709,00:02:52.125,- I'm mad too!
00:02:52.166,00:02:55.917,- Me too. Grr!
00:02:55.959,00:03:02.250,- Roar! What can we do now?
00:03:02.291,00:03:08.417,"- Well, first we need to stay calm so we can figure out what to do."
00:03:17.792,00:03:22.041,"One, two, three, four."
00:03:22.083,00:03:24.208,Now you.
00:03:24.250,00:03:27.208,- Will you do it with me?
00:03:27.250,00:03:29.208,OK.
00:03:39.458,00:03:43.709,"One, two, three, four."
00:03:43.750,00:03:47.542,- How do you feel?
00:03:47.583,00:03:49.417,But I'm still mad.
00:03:49.458,00:03:54.166,"- But now that you're calm, you can think of what to do."
00:03:56.208,00:04:01.709,"- Yeah, I royally wonder what we can do."
00:04:06.333,00:04:10.041,"So, Daniel, what do you think we should do?"
00:04:10.083,00:04:17.709,"- Well, we want to play at the beach but we can't go outside, so... what if we make a beach..."
00:04:17.750,00:04:22.375,- Inside Beach Day! Good idea.
00:04:25.583,00:04:27.750,You will? Great!
00:04:34.041,00:04:37.583,"- Terrific! Now, we need a sun for our inside beach."
00:04:42.333,00:04:45.417,- Do you see anything that looks like a sun?
00:04:45.458,00:04:47.500,Let me know when you see a sun.
00:04:51.959,00:04:53.917,- Over here!
00:05:00.792,00:05:06.166,- We have our sun.
00:05:06.208,00:05:10.125,"- Think, think, think."
00:05:10.166,00:05:13.917,- OK! Let me know when you see shells.
00:05:13.959,00:05:18.709,- Shells!
00:05:18.750,00:05:21.333,It will look sooo beach-y.
00:05:21.375,00:05:24.083,- What else do we need for our inside beach?
00:05:24.125,00:05:26.875,Hmm.
00:05:26.917,00:05:29.583,- Come on!
00:05:26.917,00:05:32.709,Let's use some sand from right outside.
00:05:29.625,00:05:35.208,There's a dry sand spot underneath the porch.
00:05:44.709,00:05:49.625,- Let's set up the inside beach.
00:05:58.166,00:06:03.000,- And our sand pails and shovels go rrright here.
00:06:06.875,00:06:11.083,- Let's add the sand to our...
00:06:15.792,00:06:22.458,- My word! What are you doing with those buckets of sand inside the house?
00:06:19.375,00:06:26.125,"- Boy, Mom, your cheeks are red."
00:06:26.166,00:06:29.834,Are you mad?
00:06:29.875,00:06:34.500,Sand is for outside!
00:06:44.792,00:06:49.917,"One, two, three, four."
00:06:49.959,00:06:52.750,"OK, I feel calmer now."
00:06:52.792,00:06:55.959,"- Good job, Mom."
00:06:56.000,00:06:59.333,"Now, why is there sand inside the house?"
00:06:59.375,00:07:02.333,- Because we wanted to make an inside beach.
00:07:02.375,00:07:04.333,"- Oh, right, OK."
00:07:04.375,00:07:09.000,But real sand is not for a pretend inside beach.
00:07:09.041,00:07:14.166,See the house? Real sand makes such a big mess on the floor.
00:07:14.208,00:07:18.250,- But how can we make an inside beach without sand?
00:07:18.291,00:07:22.750,That makes me so angry. Grr!
00:07:22.792,00:07:25.000,"- Daniel, remember the song?"
00:07:34.750,00:07:36.750,- You count too.
00:07:41.583,00:07:44.208,"- OK, I'm calmer now."
00:07:44.250,00:07:47.083,"- Nice job, Daniel and Prince Wednesday."
00:07:47.125,00:07:50.750,- Thank you. We want to make an inside beach with sand.
00:07:53.000,00:07:58.208,"- An inside beach is a good idea, but what else can we use for sand?"
00:07:58.250,00:08:02.083,- I know. Let's think.
00:08:02.125,00:08:04.417,"You know what, Daniel?"
00:08:02.125,00:08:06.875,We made a sun out of paper plates and yellow paint in school.
00:08:06.917,00:08:09.125,- Yeah?
00:08:11.834,00:08:15.375,- Good idea. And please put the pails of sand back outside.
00:08:18.166,00:08:21.208,- And-and-and sweep up the sand too please.
00:08:21.250,00:08:25.000,"- OK. Help me scoop up the sand, will ya?"
00:08:27.000,00:08:31.500,"- Scoop! Scoop, scoop, scoop! Scoop!"
00:08:31.542,00:08:34.375,"- So, what could we use that looks like sand?"
00:08:34.417,00:08:36.625,Is there anything that is the colour of sand?
00:08:38.875,00:08:43.250,- Maybe... these blankets could be sand and water!
00:08:43.291,00:08:46.000,- Blankets for sand and water?
00:08:46.041,00:08:48.667,Good idea! Let's try it!
00:08:51.542,00:08:53.333,Cool.
00:08:53.375,00:08:59.500,"- And I could put the shells on top of the blanket-- Oh, I mean sand."
00:08:59.542,00:09:03.375,And the pails and shovels go on top of the sand too.
00:09:03.417,00:09:06.166,- That's awesome!
00:09:06.208,00:09:09.542,- Inside beach with blankets for sand and water.
00:09:09.583,00:09:11.542,- Royally great!
00:09:11.583,00:09:14.834,- Let's play at our inside beach.

00:10:24.500,00:10:27.834,- I love this inside beach!
00:10:27.875,00:10:31.875,Clever idea to use blankets for sand and water.
00:10:31.917,00:10:35.375,How about a beach ball?
00:10:39.375,00:10:41.875,- Good idea.
00:10:41.917,00:10:44.625,"Ugga mugga, Daniel Tiger. Toss!"
00:10:44.667,00:10:48.333,- Toss!
00:10:48.375,00:10:51.083,- Thanks for helping me when I got mad today.
00:10:51.125,00:10:52.542,What makes you mad?
00:10:54.792,00:10:58.709,"Next time you get mad, take a deep breath and count to four."

00:05:07.041,00:05:11.125,"- Ohhh... Daniel, can you tell me what's wrong?"
00:05:11.166,00:05:14.000,- I'm upset because Katerina is sitting next to you.

00:05:51.792,00:05:56.166,"- Oh, Daniel."
00:05:56.208,00:05:58.959,I know it's hard to share the people you love.
00:05:59.000,00:06:03.250,And you are my special Daniel.
00:06:03.291,00:06:05.834,Nothing will ever change that!

00:06:38.709,00:06:41.041,"- And the princess castle, meow-meow."
00:06:41.083,00:06:45.000,"- Right. And now, do you want to see another kind of plane?"
00:06:47.792,00:06:51.291,Here are... paper airplanes!
00:06:51.333,00:06:53.291,- Ho! Ho! Ho!

00:07:17.959,00:07:21.166,"- Well, I can try."
00:07:21.208,00:07:24.166,- Hmmm...
00:07:24.208,00:07:27.333,"- Just a moment, Daniel, I'm helping Katerina right now."
00:07:27.375,00:07:30.083,- Whoosh! Watch me. Watch me!
00:07:30.125,00:07:33.583,"- Not right now, Daniel."
00:07:37.291,00:07:40.250,I want Grandpere to play with me!
00:07:40.291,00:07:42.458,"C'mon, Grandpere!"
00:07:42.500,00:07:45.750,My airplane is flying to the mountains! Let's go!

00:07:49.083,00:07:51.000,- Grrrrrr!
00:07:51.041,00:07:53.125,I'm not playing anymore!
00:07:53.166,00:07:59.208,"- Katerina, I'm going to have a chat with Daniel for a moment."
00:08:02.750,00:08:06.583,- You're not playing with me.
00:08:06.625,00:08:08.792,I feel jealous.
00:08:11.917,00:08:15.583,something out.
00:08:15.625,00:08:18.000,You're playing too much with Katerina.
00:08:18.041,00:08:20.041,I thought I was your special Daniel.
00:08:25.041,00:08:28.208,"- Yeah, but it still makes me jealous."
00:08:28.250,00:08:31.125,- I understand you feel jealous.

00:08:45.333,00:08:47.625,- I know what we need! Come on!
00:08:47.667,00:08:50.333,"Come on, Katerina!"

00:12:39.000,00:12:42.083,"- Sure, hoo-hoo!"
00:12:39.000,00:12:44.166,"- Oooh, can I make some bubbles with this bubble wand, meow-meow?"
00:12:44.208,00:12:46.166,- Oh-OK... hoo-hoo.
00:12:46.208,00:12:50.417,- Let me help you pour the bubble liquid into the container.
00:12:50.458,00:12:52.667,Hoo-hoo!
00:12:57.625,00:13:01.166,"- And then, wave it in the air!"
00:13:01.208,00:13:04.333,"- Meow-meow, bubbles!"
00:13:04.375,00:13:06.875,- Look at all the bubbles!

00:13:14.583,00:13:17.792,"Katerina, uh, your mom will be here soon to pick you up."
00:13:17.834,00:13:21.583,"- OK, meow-meow."
00:13:21.625,00:13:24.959,- Look at the bubble!
00:13:25.000,00:13:28.083,It popped! Ha! Ha! Ha!
00:13:28.125,00:13:30.959,"- I like making these bubbles, meow-meow."
00:13:31.000,00:13:33.208,I wish I had a science kit.
00:13:33.250,00:13:35.375,"- Yeah, it's tigertastic!"
00:13:35.417,00:13:37.792,"- Hello, Katerina, meow-meow."
00:13:37.834,00:13:41.583,We're making bubbles with O's science kit! Watch!
00:13:41.625,00:13:44.125,"- How wonderful, meow-meow!"
00:13:44.166,00:13:46.917,"But now, we have to go to the grocery store."
00:13:46.959,00:13:50.250,So please give the bubble wand back to O and let's go.
00:13:54.250,00:13:58.208,"- But, it's mine, hoo-hoo."
00:13:58.250,00:14:01.458,"- I know, meow-meow, but I really want it!"
00:14:01.500,00:14:04.834,"- I hear you, Katerina, but this is O's, not yours."
00:14:08.458,00:14:10.458,- I wish the bubble wand was mine.
00:14:10.500,00:14:12.917,"- I understand, meow-meow."
00:14:12.959,00:14:14.750,It sounds like you're feeling jealous.
00:14:14.792,00:14:17.041,- Jealous?
00:14:17.083,00:14:21.208,"When you want something someone else has, you are feeling jealous."
00:14:21.250,00:14:24.792,"- Hmmm, meow-meow."
00:14:38.083,00:14:46.250,"- OK... I... I really liked playing with this bubble wand, and I want to play more with it."
00:14:46.291,00:14:49.458,- Mm-hmm.
00:14:49.500,00:14:54.041,- I'm glad you're having fun and you can play with the bubble wand while you're here.
00:14:54.083,00:14:56.834,But you can't take it home.
00:15:00.250,00:15:03.250,- OK. O...
00:15:03.291,00:15:06.667,"can I play with your science kit another time, meow-meow?"
00:15:10.625,00:15:13.959,- Yes!
00:15:14.000,00:15:16.709,Play with it here...
00:15:16.750,00:15:18.959,"- Thanks, meow-meow."
00:15:25.291,00:15:28.959,I'm glad we talked about it.
00:15:29.000,00:15:32.083,"- And now, we have to go."
00:15:32.125,00:15:34.125,"- Hoo-hoo, bye-bye!"
00:15:34.166,00:15:36.375,"- Bye, Katerina!"
00:15:39.583,00:15:42.166,"- Bye! C'mon, O, let's make more bubbles!"
00:15:44.875,00:15:47.875,Look at all the bubbles!
00:15:47.917,00:15:51.542,"- Hoo-hoo, come over here and look at this bug I found!"
00:15:51.583,00:15:56.750,- Ooh! Tigertastic! I like bugs.
00:15:59.333,00:16:01.625,- Umm... can I hold it?
00:16:01.667,00:16:05.041,I really like using it.
00:16:01.667,00:16:10.250,"- OK. You hold it, but we'll both look, and I'll write the bugs we find in my notebook."
00:16:10.291,00:16:13.417,- Thank you.
00:16:13.458,00:16:15.709,- Hoo-hoo! There's another bug over here!
00:16:15.750,00:16:18.291,- There it is!
00:16:15.750,00:16:21.417,"- Heeey, hoo-hoo, I know this bug. It's a beetle!"
00:16:21.458,00:16:23.709,- It's wiggling!
00:16:23.750,00:16:27.041,It looks like it's dancing!
00:16:27.083,00:16:29.041,"Doo-de-doo, hoo-hoo-hoo!"
00:16:29.083,00:16:32.125,- Ladybug dance! Cha cha cha!
00:16:32.166,00:16:36.083,- I like looking at bugs with O's magnifying glass.
00:16:42.667,00:16:46.250,Heeey... do you want to make believe with me?
00:16:46.291,00:16:51.291,Let's make believe that we are dancing with the bugs!
00:17:38.542,00:17:42.166,I mean O's magnifying glass.
00:17:42.208,00:17:44.667,I wish it was my magnifying glass.
00:17:44.709,00:17:47.959,"- Hey, Daniel, I found a bug to look at, hoo-hoo!"
00:17:53.125,00:17:56.583,I want it!
00:17:56.625,00:17:59.375,It's mine.
00:17:59.417,00:18:01.750,I don't want to give it back!
00:18:01.792,00:18:06.166,"What, hoo-hoo?"
00:18:06.208,00:18:09.583,Have you ever wanted something your friend had?
00:18:09.625,00:18:13.583,I really want O's magnifying glass.
00:18:13.625,00:18:17.375,- But it is... not... yours!
00:18:17.417,00:18:19.583,- Is everything OK over here?
00:18:19.625,00:18:23.041,- Daniel won't give me back my magnifying glass!
00:18:23.083,00:18:27.667,"Hoo-hoo! He, he wants to take it... home!"
00:18:27.709,00:18:32.875,"- Daniel, you want something that your friend O here, has."
00:18:35.625,00:18:38.208,"- Yeah, I'm feeling jealous."
00:18:51.417,00:18:54.667,Talk about it... OK...
00:18:54.709,00:19:00.959,"well, I wish I had my own magnifying glass so I could be a scientist!"
00:18:58.083,00:19:04.500,- Did you know that you don't need a magnifying glass to be a scientist?
00:19:04.542,00:19:07.959,- Really?
00:19:04.542,00:19:13.709,- Yes! A scientist looks with his eyes and listens with his ears to learn about the world around him.
00:19:13.750,00:19:17.625,"- Oh! Here, O, I know this is yours."
00:19:17.667,00:19:19.625,"- Thanks, Daniel."
00:19:17.667,00:19:23.458,"- I'm glad we talked about it, friend."
00:20:31.625,00:20:36.709,"- OK, scientists, be on the lookout for things to explore!"
00:20:36.750,00:20:39.125,- OK!
00:20:39.166,00:20:40.834,- Hmmm...
00:20:40.875,00:20:42.834,- I hear a frog!
00:20:42.875,00:20:45.125,- I see him!
00:20:45.166,00:20:48.583,"- Hi, Mr. Frog. Ribbit! Ribbit!"
00:20:52.000,00:20:53.959,"- Hoo-hoo, no, O."
00:20:54.000,00:20:56.667,"Remember, you can play with him here."
00:20:56.709,00:20:58.667,with you!
00:20:58.709,00:21:04.208,"- I was feeling jealous today, because I wanted O's magnifying glass."
00:21:04.250,00:21:07.333,Do you ever feel jealous?
00:21:10.000,00:21:12.750,Talking about it might help you feel better.
00:21:12.792,00:21:15.291,It helped me! Ugga-mugga.
00:21:59.875,00:22:01.875,Because it's you I like.
00:00:48.291,00:00:50.250,- Your turn!
00:00:50.291,00:00:51.625,- OK!
00:00:51.667,00:00:54.291,- Whoops! Hup! Oops!
00:00:54.333,00:00:56.166,Oops!
00:00:56.208,00:00:59.166,"Hi, neighbour! I'm at the park with my friends."
00:00:59.208,00:01:01.959,"- Hiya, toots!"
00:01:02.000,00:01:03.917,- I've been working on my hopping.
00:01:03.959,00:01:08.917,Want to see?
00:01:08.959,00:01:12.542,One! Two! Three!
00:01:12.583,00:01:15.709,Three whole hops!
00:01:15.750,00:01:17.750,Whoops!
00:01:17.792,00:01:20.750,Let's go show my friends.
00:01:22.375,00:01:24.333,- Guess what?
00:01:24.375,00:01:28.542,- I did three whole...
00:01:28.583,00:01:30.542,- Ho-ho-ho!
00:01:30.583,00:01:32.959,"- That's rrroyally great, Little D!"
00:01:33.000,00:01:34.959,"- Thanks, Prince Tuesday!"
00:01:35.000,00:01:38.333,And I think I can do it again too. Want to see?
00:01:38.375,00:01:40.333,- OK - Sure.
00:01:40.375,00:01:43.125,"- OK, count my hops! Ready?"
00:01:43.166,00:01:46.709,One... two.. three...
00:01:46.750,00:01:50.583,four... five!
00:01:50.625,00:01:54.166,Five hops!
00:01:54.208,00:01:57.542,- Five hippity-hoppity hops!
00:01:57.583,00:02:00.333,- Ha! Ha! Ha!
00:02:00.375,00:02:13.291,"It's like they tell us at baseball practice: It's true! The more I hop, the better I get!"
00:02:13.333,00:02:16.083,I remember when I could only do ONE hop!
00:02:16.125,00:02:19.583,"And now... hop, hop, hippity-hoppity-hop!"
00:02:25.166,00:02:27.417,I also got better at throwing a ball.
00:02:27.458,00:02:30.375,Watch!
00:02:32.792,00:02:36.250,"- Really, REALLY high!"
00:02:36.291,00:02:38.417,- Rrroyally high!
00:02:38.458,00:02:42.250,"Wow! You are a great baseball player, Prince Tuesday!"
00:02:42.291,00:02:45.291,"- Thanks, Little D!"
00:02:45.333,00:02:47.959,"- I love it, toots!"
00:02:48.000,00:02:50.834,- Wouldn't it be fun to be a great baseball player?
00:02:50.875,00:02:54.041,"Hey, do you want to make believe with me?"
00:02:54.083,00:02:59.125,Let's make believe... that I'm a GREAT baseball player!
00:03:34.041,00:03:37.542,Wasn't that grr-ific?
00:03:37.583,00:03:39.875,Watch this trick!
00:03:39.917,00:03:42.875,- Wow!
00:03:42.917,00:03:46.583,"- Ah, thank you very much!"
00:03:46.625,00:03:49.959,"I had to try it again and again, but then... I got better!"
00:03:50.041,00:03:53.125,- I want to play ball too!
00:03:53.166,00:03:56.083,- Yeah!
00:03:58.208,00:04:00.792,- OK!
00:04:00.834,00:04:03.291,"Wait, what's animal ball?"
00:04:03.333,00:04:05.583,- I just made it up.
00:04:05.625,00:04:08.250,"First, let's stand in a circle."
00:04:08.291,00:04:11.375,"OK, now we throw the ball to each other."
00:04:11.417,00:04:15.083,"But before you throw the ball, say the name of an animal."
00:04:15.125,00:04:18.041,Then we all make the animal sound.
00:04:20.875,00:04:23.750,Hey! You can make the animal sounds too!
00:04:23.792,00:04:26.583,- Ready?
00:04:28.333,00:04:31.792,- Ruff! Ruff! I got it!
00:04:31.834,00:04:35.166,mooo!
00:04:35.208,00:04:37.458,Grr!
00:04:37.500,00:04:39.834,"Hey, I missed the ball."
00:04:39.875,00:04:41.375,"- Hey, good try, Daniel."
00:04:41.417,00:04:45.000,"- Yeah, but I wanted to catch the ball."
00:04:45.041,00:04:46.834,- Keep practicing.
00:04:54.542,00:04:58.750,"- Next time, try looking right at the ball as it comes to you, OK?"
00:04:58.792,00:05:01.667,- Let's try again. And...
00:05:01.709,00:05:04.166,and a duck says...
00:05:06.208,00:05:10.166,- A dog says...
00:05:10.208,00:05:12.917,- Here it comes!
00:05:12.959,00:05:15.667,Grr! I missed AGAIN.
00:05:15.709,00:05:17.625,"- That's OK, Daniel."
00:05:17.667,00:05:20.625,- How would you feel if you couldn't catch a ball?
00:05:20.667,00:05:23.166,I feel sad.
00:05:23.208,00:05:25.959,"- Heh, you OK, Little D?"
00:05:26.000,00:05:29.542,- I'm no good at this game.
00:05:29.583,00:05:33.750,"- You know what? When I first started playing baseball, I couldn't catch the ball either."
00:05:33.792,00:05:36.208,- Really?
00:05:46.458,00:05:48.500,But I AM trying!
00:05:48.542,00:05:51.375,- You are trying. And you know what else will help?
00:05:51.417,00:05:54.375,- What?
00:05:56.667,00:06:00.792,Then... give it a biiiiiig hug!
00:06:00.834,00:06:02.542,- Biiig hug!
00:06:05.208,00:06:08.750,"- Yup, I'm ready to try again."
00:06:08.792,00:06:11.542,"- Yay! Throw the ball, big brother!"
00:06:11.583,00:06:16.041,- Ready? And a duck says...
00:06:16.083,00:06:19.208,"- OK, I'm watching..."
00:06:19.250,00:06:21.083,I'm wat-- Wha-- Oops!
00:06:21.125,00:06:23.333,Grr! I dropped it!
00:06:23.375,00:06:26.250,"- Aw, you almost got it, Daniel."
00:06:26.291,00:06:30.959,"You watched the ball, and now you just need to remember to give it a biiiiiiig hug!"
00:06:38.750,00:06:42.542,- OK! I can do it.
00:06:42.583,00:06:46.500,"- Ready, set, THROW!"
00:06:46.542,00:06:48.875,- A cow says... moo!
00:06:51.458,00:06:54.500,"- Ready, Daniel?"
00:07:00.834,00:07:02.834,- Here it comes.
00:07:02.875,00:07:05.834,"A dog says... ruff, ruff, ruff!"
00:07:05.875,00:07:07.667,I'm watching... I'm watching...
00:07:07.709,00:07:10.625,Biiiiiiig hug! I did it!
00:07:10.667,00:07:13.083,I caught the ball!
00:07:18.166,00:07:20.917,- Hooray for Daniel!
00:07:20.959,00:07:26.458,"- Thanks! I tried, and I tried, and I caught the ball!"
00:07:28.917,00:07:32.458,And you know what I do when I'm happy? I hop!
00:07:32.500,00:07:34.500,Hoppity-hoppity-hop!
00:07:34.542,00:07:38.500,"- Wow, Daniel Tiger, you can do so many hops!"
00:07:38.542,00:07:43.500,- I know! Wanna hop with me? It's fun!
00:07:43.542,00:07:46.125,- Hey! I can't do it!
00:07:46.166,00:07:49.625,"I tried again, but I still can't hop!"
00:07:49.667,00:07:52.083,Hopping is too hard.
00:08:01.083,00:08:02.959,You just need to practice like me.
00:08:03.000,00:08:05.250,"- OK, I guess I can try again."
00:08:05.291,00:08:07.583,Will you show me how?
00:08:07.625,00:08:10.667,I stand on one foot like this.
00:08:10.709,00:08:13.333,And then I...
00:08:13.375,00:08:15.333,- Stand on one foot...
00:08:18.375,00:08:20.917,I did it! I hopped!
00:08:20.959,00:08:23.959,Whoops! Ha! Ha! Ha!
00:08:24.000,00:08:27.959,- Let's do it again.
00:08:35.500,00:08:37.709,"Let's go again, together."

00:10:49.000,00:10:53.166,What are you trying to get better at?
00:10:53.208,00:10:56.625,"You know, if you keep trying, you'll get better too!"
00:11:06.375,00:11:09.041,"- Hi, neighbour!"
00:11:09.083,00:11:11.250,Do you go to school?
00:11:11.291,00:11:14.250,"See, this is my school."
00:11:14.291,00:11:17.959,"- OK, Daniel, let's get ready for school!"
00:11:18.000,00:11:19.959,I'm ready to go to school!

00:11:26.625,00:11:31.250,"I'm going to school, and YOU'RE going to work!"
00:11:31.291,00:11:39.500,"- Ohhh, that's right. It's a little cold outside today, so let's put on your coat, OK?"
00:11:39.542,00:11:41.500,- Of course.
00:11:41.542,00:11:43.500,- Ugh!
00:11:43.542,00:11:48.750,"Oh, I can't button it!"
00:11:51.250,00:11:54.583,Now pull the button through the hole. Pull it through.
00:11:54.625,00:11:56.750,- Oh!
00:11:56.792,00:11:59.208,"Remember: Peek-a-boo, pull it through."
00:12:01.375,00:12:04.333,"- Peek-a-boo, pull it..."
00:12:04.375,00:12:07.959,Peek-a-boo... pull it. Grr!
00:12:10.500,00:12:13.250,- I know it's upsetting when you can't get it.
00:12:16.917,00:12:21.542,"If you keep trying to button your coat, you'll get better and better."
00:12:25.500,00:12:27.625,"OK, I'll try again."
00:12:27.667,00:12:31.208,Peek-a-boo... pull it through.

00:12:55.250,00:12:59.041,"We're going to school, and I buttoned my coat all by myself!"
00:13:11.458,00:13:13.834,Let's go inside.
00:13:13.875,00:13:16.125,"Goodbye, Trolley!"
00:13:23.041,00:13:25.834,- Good morning Mr. Tiger.
00:13:25.875,00:13:28.208,- Look! My neighbour came to school too!
00:13:28.250,00:13:29.583,"- Hi, neighbour!"
00:13:31.458,00:13:35.041,"- Bye, Daniel. Ugga-mugga."
00:13:35.083,00:13:37.417,"- Hoo-hoo, coming through!"
00:13:40.166,00:13:42.291,- Hoo-hoo!
00:13:42.333,00:13:44.834,That's a lot of blocks.
00:13:44.875,00:13:51.500,"- I need all the blocks in the classroom, because I'm building the tallest tower in the world!"
00:13:51.542,00:13:55.000,in the world!
00:13:55.041,00:13:58.083,I'm ready to build! Hoo-hoo!
00:13:58.125,00:13:59.917,- Great!
00:13:59.959,00:14:03.125,- One block here...
00:14:03.166,00:14:05.750,this one here... there...
00:14:05.792,00:14:08.542,another one here...
00:14:11.000,00:14:14.291,"- Blue, like my feathers!"
00:14:14.333,00:14:17.125,- What's your favourite colour?
00:14:17.166,00:14:19.125,I like red.
00:14:19.166,00:14:21.542,- Hoo! This is nifty-galifty!
00:14:21.583,00:14:24.208,The tower!
00:14:24.250,00:14:27.208,"Oh, no, no, no!"
00:14:27.250,00:14:30.250,"Hoo, no!"
00:14:27.250,00:14:33.792,"- Oh, no! O, are you OK?"
00:14:33.834,00:14:39.250,- You can build your tower again. I'll help you and hand you blocks.
00:14:39.291,00:14:44.500,"Building again, building, building the tallest tower in the world."
00:14:44.542,00:14:46.917,- Your tower is so tall already.
00:14:46.959,00:14:50.125,It's as tall as my tummy!
00:14:50.166,00:14:52.917,- Yeah! Now it's as tall as my beak!
00:14:52.959,00:14:54.917,Another one here...
00:14:54.959,00:14:58.709,there... and another one here.
00:15:00.583,00:15:03.583,The red one on top...
00:15:03.625,00:15:06.000,Hoo-hoo! Whoa!
00:15:06.041,00:15:10.458,"Ah! Hoo, it fell down again!"
00:15:10.500,00:15:12.625,"Hoo, no!"
00:15:12.667,00:15:14.250,What's the matter?
00:15:14.291,00:15:16.542,- My tower keeps falling!
00:15:16.583,00:15:18.667,Hoo-hoo!
00:15:18.709,00:15:22.959,"You feel like you can't get those blocks to stay up, and that is frustrating."
00:15:23.000,00:15:25.542,But can you try and rebuild the tower?
00:15:32.834,00:15:36.250,"But I already tried, and it didn't work."
00:15:36.291,00:15:39.917,- Sometimes you have to keep trying before you get better.
00:15:39.959,00:15:43.792,How can we find out more about building tall block towers?
00:15:43.834,00:15:47.166,- There's a book for that!
00:15:43.834,00:15:52.583,Hoo-hoo! My book says that big blocks on the bottom of the tower will make it strong.
00:15:52.625,00:15:54.375,"Hoo-hoo, what about these?"
00:15:58.875,00:16:01.208,in the world!
00:16:01.250,00:16:02.834,- Hoo-hoo!
00:16:07.458,00:16:10.834,"Hey, that gives me an idea."
00:16:53.458,00:16:56.792,- Wasn't that grr-ific?
00:16:56.834,00:16:58.792,We did such a good job.
00:16:58.834,00:17:02.125,- Nifty-galifty! Wah!
00:17:05.250,00:17:08.125,I'm gonna stop.
00:17:15.083,00:17:18.208,- Don't stop now O.
00:17:15.083,00:17:20.792,"It might take a few tries, but you'll get it."
00:17:18.250,00:17:30.500,Remember: - But what if I DON'T get better?
00:17:30.542,00:17:32.417,"- I think you can do this, O."
00:17:32.458,00:17:35.166,Let's look at the tower picture in your book again.
00:17:35.208,00:17:38.625,What do you notice about these blocks?
00:17:47.291,00:17:54.125,Hoo-hoo! So maybe I should try building with the blocks lying down sideways.
00:17:54.166,00:17:57.834,"- OK, I'll keep trying."
00:18:05.500,00:18:07.792,- This one here...
00:18:07.834,00:18:11.000,- ...another one here. Hoo-hoo!
00:18:11.041,00:18:13.208,"- You're doing great, O!"
00:18:13.250,00:18:17.041,"- Meow-meow, I like your tower, O."
00:18:17.083,00:18:20.417,- Thanks! I only have four blocks left!
00:18:17.083,00:18:22.875,- Tallest tower in the world! Again!
00:18:27.250,00:18:30.208,- The tower!
00:18:30.250,00:18:32.000,I can't look.
00:18:32.041,00:18:33.792,"- Look, O, you did it!"
00:18:33.834,00:18:35.834,- Hoo-hoo! I did do it!
00:18:48.041,00:18:50.250,- Hoo-hoo!
00:18:50.291,00:18:53.417,"- See that, O?"
00:18:55.417,00:18:58.041,- I do! Hoo-hoo!
00:18:58.083,00:19:01.583,- I'm going to take a picture.
00:19:01.625,00:19:03.250,- Ta-da!
00:19:09.542,00:19:13.041,- Yeah! Woo-hoo!
00:19:15.458,00:19:20.417,"- Oh, no. I can't do up my buttons, meow-meow."
00:19:20.458,00:19:22.625,"- Look at this trick, Katerina."
00:19:22.667,00:19:25.625,"Peek-a-boo, pull it through!"
00:19:25.667,00:19:30.625,"- Oh, hmm. Peek-a-boo, pull it through."
00:19:37.041,00:19:39.542,- I'll keep trying.
00:20:42.291,00:20:46.417,"- Peek a boo, pull it through."
00:20:46.458,00:20:49.417,Look! I did it!
00:20:52.000,00:20:53.792,- Yeah!
00:20:57.667,00:21:00.792,"- You're a good friend, Daniel Tiger."
00:21:03.083,00:21:05.625,- Have you ever tried to button your own coat?
00:21:05.667,00:21:08.208,"Or build a tall, tall tower?"
00:21:11.250,00:21:15.375,"It's hard, but if you keep trying, you will get better!"
00:21:15.417,00:21:17.709,Ugga-mugga!

00:05:45.208,00:05:49.041,- Because I don't have a car.
00:05:49.083,00:05:51.959,- But it's MY tigertastic car.

00:05:19.375,00:05:25.083,Let's make believe that Tigey and I are farmers together!
00:06:01.000,00:06:03.917,- Wasn't that grrr-ific?
00:06:03.959,00:06:06.208,"I love you, Tigey."
00:06:08.250,00:06:10.834,A house for Tigey.
00:06:10.875,00:06:14.709,"Do you like your house, Tigey?"
00:06:28.125,00:06:30.083,Ha! Ha! Ha!
00:06:30.125,00:06:32.083,"- Hiya, neighbour! Hiya, toots!"

00:06:38.917,00:06:41.625,- Yep! A backwards firefighter!
00:06:44.500,00:06:47.250,"- Good idea, toots!"
00:06:52.125,00:06:54.959,OK! Let's go play in my room!
00:06:58.208,00:07:00.917,Weeee-ooooo! Wee-oo!
00:07:00.959,00:07:03.959,- I'm a firefighter too!
00:07:07.458,00:07:09.875,And Tigey is my firefighter helper!
00:07:09.917,00:07:12.125,- Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo!
00:07:19.375,00:07:21.709,"Come on, Tigey, stay close to me."
00:07:21.750,00:07:24.458,- Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo!
00:07:24.500,00:07:28.083,- Look! Look at that over there!
00:07:28.125,00:07:30.208,- What? Does someone need help?
00:07:47.208,00:07:50.208,"Come on, Daniel!"
00:07:52.291,00:07:54.750,"- Daniel, why are you grrr-ing?"
00:07:54.792,00:07:58.125,- Grr! Grr! Grr!
00:08:00.375,00:08:03.250,- Uh-oh! Is everything OK?
00:08:05.291,00:08:08.083,- Grrr!
00:08:05.291,00:08:10.166,"- Daniel, remember, I can only help you if you..."
00:08:18.542,00:08:27.583,"Well... we were playing, but then Miss Elaina took Tigey and then, and then..."
00:08:27.625,00:08:31.000,- But I was just playing.
00:08:31.041,00:08:32.917,- I don't want you to throw Tigey!
00:08:32.959,00:08:35.709,He's special to me!
00:08:35.750,00:08:37.792,- Tigey is special!
00:08:37.834,00:08:40.000,I'm sorry I threw Tigey.
00:08:40.041,00:08:42.333,I didn't mean to make you upset!
00:08:42.375,00:08:44.417,Can I help make it better?
00:08:44.458,00:08:47.458,- Well... can you give him back to me now?
00:08:47.500,00:08:49.542,"- Sure, toots! Sorry, buddy."
00:08:49.583,00:08:52.875,Here you go!
00:08:58.417,00:09:01.333,I didn't know because you were just grrr-ing.
00:09:01.375,00:09:03.458,Good thing you used your words!
00:09:36.375,00:09:38.959,- Do you need a hug?
00:10:09.583,00:10:13.083,"- So, I think I'm ready to play firefighter now."
00:10:13.125,00:10:15.291,"- Oh, good, firefighter Daniel!"
00:10:15.333,00:10:18.333,"Then, it's time for us to... help someone!"
00:10:18.375,00:10:21.166,- Who are we going to help this time!?
00:10:21.208,00:10:23.291,- Mrs. Tiger.
00:10:25.333,00:10:28.083,- Please save me and my chicken!
00:10:28.125,00:10:30.542,Bok-bok-bok! Bok-bok-bok-bok!
00:10:30.583,00:10:32.834,We're stuck in this tree!
00:10:32.875,00:10:36.125,- Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo!
00:10:38.083,00:10:41.041,- We'll save you!
00:10:41.083,00:10:44.041,- Phew! You saved me!
00:10:44.083,00:10:46.333,And my chicken! Bok! Bok! Bok!
00:10:50.375,00:10:57.000,"I like playing with Miss Elaina, and I'm glad I used my words to tell her not to throw Tigey."
00:10:57.041,00:11:00.333,It helped! Ugga mugga!
00:11:03.875,00:11:06.917,"- Choo-choo! Hi, neighbour!"
00:11:06.959,00:11:09.291,"- Hello, neighbour."
00:11:09.333,00:11:12.959,"It's me, Daniel Tiger, and I like trains!"
00:11:13.000,00:11:16.250,Do you like trains?
00:11:18.333,00:11:23.000,"That's where the engineer sits and he says, All aboard!"
00:11:23.041,00:11:26.041,Come play train with me.
00:11:28.417,00:11:30.125,Chuga-chuga-chuga-chuga!
00:11:30.166,00:11:32.583,"Chuga-chuga-chuga-chuga, choo-choo!"
00:11:32.625,00:11:35.959,Chuga-chuga-chuga-chuga!
00:11:36.000,00:11:37.750,"Chuga-chuga, chuga-chuga, choo-choo!"
00:11:42.083,00:11:44.792,"- Hello, neighbour."
00:11:46.834,00:11:49.417,We have all the parts. See?
00:11:49.458,00:11:54.333,"The engine, the cars and the caboose!"
00:11:54.375,00:11:56.333,"Now, we just need to put them in order."
00:11:56.375,00:11:58.917,Which part of the train goes first?
00:12:00.917,00:12:06.166,"- The engine goes first, so it can pull the train."
00:12:06.208,00:12:10.250,"- Yes! And it makes it go fast, fast, fast!"
00:12:10.291,00:12:12.500,Which part of the train comes next?
00:12:24.667,00:12:30.250,"Hello, Mister Bear. And now, the last part of the train, the caboose!"
00:12:30.291,00:12:32.625,- The caboose always goes on the end of the train.
00:12:32.667,00:12:34.667,Caboose! Ha! Ha! Ha!
00:12:34.709,00:12:36.792,"That's a funny word, meow-meow."
00:12:39.667,00:12:42.542,- Ha! Ha! Tada! We made a train!
00:12:42.583,00:12:45.667,- Oooh! Great job on that train!
00:12:45.709,00:12:48.166,There we go!
00:12:48.208,00:12:51.333,"There! Now, you can put it on."
00:12:53.875,00:12:57.125,- I want to be the engineer and ride in the engine.
00:13:00.083,00:13:04.208,"Hey, do you want to make believe with me?"
00:13:11.625,00:13:15.166,All aboard!
00:13:44.458,00:13:46.625,- Wasn't that grrr-ific?

00:14:05.458,00:14:07.750,"- All aboard! Come on, Daniel, let's play train."
00:14:07.792,00:14:09.750,Chuga-chuga-chuga-chuga!
00:14:09.792,00:14:12.041,- Grrr! Grrr!
00:14:12.083,00:14:16.125,"- Daniel, what's wrong?"
00:14:16.166,00:14:19.375,- GRRR-RRR!
00:14:19.417,00:14:21.709,"- Hi, Katerina. Hi, Daniel."
00:14:25.208,00:14:27.875,"- Something's wrong with Daniel, meow-meow."
00:14:27.917,00:14:30.458,"- Daniel, can you tell us what's wrong?"
00:14:30.500,00:14:32.333,- Grrr-rrr-rrr!
00:14:37.959,00:14:40.333,and tell us what the problem is.
00:14:40.375,00:14:43.417,- I want to be the train engineer. Not Katerina!
00:14:43.458,00:14:46.625,So I am mad! Grrr!
00:14:46.667,00:14:49.792,"- Good job using your words, Daniel. Katerina?"
00:14:54.959,00:15:00.500,"- Yes! The engineer gets to wear that hat and say, All aboard, and sit in the engine!"
00:15:00.542,00:15:02.500,That's my favourite part!
00:15:02.542,00:15:07.542,- Ohhh! I didn't know it was your favourite part.
00:15:07.583,00:15:10.834,"- Daniel, did you tell Katerina you wanted to be the engineer?"
00:15:17.959,00:15:19.959,- Well...
00:15:20.000,00:15:23.083,"you can be the train engineer, meow-meow. Here."
00:15:23.125,00:15:26.500,- Really? Thanks!
00:15:26.542,00:15:29.542,"- You're welcome, meow-meow."
00:15:34.000,00:15:41.291,It's the silliest part of the train! Cabooooooose!
00:15:45.625,00:15:47.917,...it helps your friends know what you're feeling.
00:15:52.333,00:15:55.250,- Using my words worked!
00:15:55.291,00:15:58.500,Have a good train ride.
00:15:58.542,00:16:02.750,Where should we go?
00:16:02.792,00:16:05.542,the jungle! Meow-meow!
00:16:05.583,00:16:07.959,- All aboard!
00:16:05.583,00:16:10.208,This train is leaving the station for the jungle.
00:16:10.250,00:16:12.333,"Chuga-chuga-chuga- chuga, choo-choo!"
00:16:12.375,00:16:14.375,"- Chuga-chuga-chuga, choo-choo!"
00:16:14.417,00:16:16.375,- Ride with us! Like this!

00:16:21.583,00:16:24.709,"Chuga-chuga-chuga-chuga, choo-choo!"
00:16:31.000,00:16:33.208,- Let's explore the jungle!
00:16:33.250,00:16:36.750,- Let's use our binoculars!
00:16:36.792,00:16:39.333,- I see alligators!
00:16:42.667,00:16:45.542,I see... an owl!
00:16:45.583,00:16:47.542,O the Owl!
00:16:47.583,00:16:50.250,"Hi, O, look at our train!"
00:16:50.291,00:16:52.333,- That's just like the train in my book!
00:16:52.375,00:16:54.875,- Yeah!
00:16:54.917,00:16:57.792,This can be a monkey train!
00:16:59.792,00:17:02.792,Ooh-ooh! Ahh-ahh!
00:17:05.375,00:17:08.333,"- All aboard, Mrs. Panda!"
00:17:08.375,00:17:12.333,"- Sorry, panda, monkey trains are for monkeys."
00:17:12.375,00:17:16.208,"- All aboard, Mister Lion! Rrroar!"
00:17:16.250,00:17:19.750,"- Lion, monkey trains are for monkeys!"
00:17:19.792,00:17:22.792,"- All aboard, Mrs. Platypus!"
00:17:22.834,00:17:29.041,"- Ana Platypus, monkey trains are for monkeys! Meow-meow!"
00:17:29.083,00:17:32.291,"- All aboard, Ella Phant."
00:17:32.333,00:17:36.166,"- Katerina, are you OK?"
00:17:36.208,00:17:39.750,- Meow-meow! Meow! Meow-meow!
00:17:39.792,00:17:43.083,"- Katerina, I can see you're upset."
00:17:43.125,00:17:46.375,What's the problem?
00:17:51.166,00:17:54.417,...so I can help you.
00:17:56.875,00:18:01.917,"I'm upset because I want this to be a monkey train, and you keep putting in other animals!"
00:18:01.959,00:18:04.709,- A monkey train!?
00:18:04.750,00:18:06.792,"Meow-meow, a monkey train!"
00:18:06.834,00:18:09.917,Only monkeys on the monkey train!
00:18:09.959,00:18:12.959,This platypus is not a monkey!
00:18:13.000,00:18:17.166,This elephant is not a monkey!
00:18:17.208,00:18:21.458,"- But, Katerina, I didn't know that you wanted it to be a monkey train."
00:18:21.500,00:18:24.625,- What?
00:18:27.000,00:18:28.959,I guess I didn't tell you.
00:18:29.000,00:18:31.291,- I didn't mean to make you mad.
00:18:33.333,00:18:35.625,"- Thank you for using your words, both of you."
00:18:35.667,00:18:38.125,Now you can work together to solve your problem.
00:18:42.750,00:18:46.375,"- So, can it be a monkey train, Daniel?"
00:18:46.417,00:18:50.333,- I think...
00:18:53.083,00:18:56.041,"I feel much better, meow-meow!"
00:18:58.083,00:19:00.750,on the monkey train!
00:19:03.583,00:19:06.834,"Meow-meow! Meow-meow, meow-meow!"
00:19:11.166,00:19:16.000,I love playing train with you and the monkeys!
00:19:16.041,00:19:19.500,- Ooh-ooh! Ahh-ahh! Ha! Ha! Ha!
00:19:35.667,00:19:38.250,"Then I said, I'm sorry."
00:19:38.291,00:19:41.917,"Katerina understood, and now we're OK."
00:19:59.250,00:20:02.208,"Then I said, That upsets me. Don't, please."
00:20:19.667,00:20:24.166,- Choo-choo! Let's take this monkey train for a ride!
00:20:24.208,00:20:26.667,- Hoo-hoo! I want to ride the train too!
00:20:29.667,00:20:31.625,Ooh-ooh! Ahh-ahh!
00:20:31.667,00:20:34.166,"Well, OK, then, meow-meow!"
00:20:34.208,00:20:36.250,- All aboard!
00:20:36.291,00:20:38.875,This monkey train is leaving the station!
00:20:38.917,00:20:41.166,"- Chuga-chuga-chuga-chuga, hoo-hoo!"
00:20:43.250,00:20:46.542,- This monkey train is about to stop!
00:20:50.333,00:20:52.250,Stop!
00:20:52.291,00:20:55.083,"- Oh! Welcome home, monkeys!"
00:21:01.625,00:21:05.709,I liked playing train today.
00:21:05.750,00:21:08.542,I had to use my words!
00:21:08.583,00:21:11.500,Do you use your words when you're upset?
00:21:11.542,00:21:14.291,"When I did, it really helped."
00:21:14.333,00:21:17.542,Ugga mugga!
00:21:26.875,00:21:30.834,- Hi!
00:00:34.041,00:00:50.625,on every street - Hi neighbour!
00:00:59.792,00:01:04.959,Will you come with me?
00:01:05.000,00:01:06.875,"- Ugga Mugga, Daniel Tiger."
00:01:08.917,00:01:11.875,- Yes. I mean... no.
00:01:11.917,00:01:13.875,- No? Hmm.
00:01:13.917,00:01:29.583,You know what I always say: Like go to school!
00:01:37.750,00:01:41.250,Hmm. Blocks?
00:01:41.291,00:01:45.083,"- Oh, yes."
00:01:45.125,00:01:49.500,- Hmm! But I'll bring my red block... just in case.
00:01:52.959,00:01:54.333,What else?
00:01:54.375,00:01:57.959,- Mmm... will we read books at school?
00:01:58.000,00:02:02.291,"- Oh, yes! Your teacher will read all sorts of books."
00:02:02.333,00:02:09.208,- But maybe I should bring my favourite Tigey the Adventure Tiger book... just in case.
00:02:11.000,00:02:16.792,"- Mmm... and my Tigey, 'cause he'd be lonely here without me."
00:02:16.834,00:02:18.583,"There you go, Tigey!"
00:02:24.583,00:02:27.709,Ready!
00:02:27.750,00:02:31.166,"- Goodness, I hope your backpack isn't too heavy."
00:02:31.208,00:02:34.709,- Don't worry.
00:02:36.750,00:02:40.125,"Hello, Trolley!"
00:02:44.834,00:02:47.458,- That IS heavy.
00:02:49.792,00:02:52.041,Buckle up!
00:03:05.500,00:03:09.208,"- Mom, what do you think Teacher Harriet is like?"
00:03:13.875,00:03:15.875,- I like music too!
00:03:15.917,00:03:20.875,- Hm. and she knows how to take good care of you.
00:03:20.917,00:03:23.083,Oh. Here we are at the Neighbourhood School!
00:03:25.709,00:03:28.959,"- Thanks for the ride, Trolley."
00:03:32.291,00:03:34.750,Wooooow.
00:03:39.250,00:03:43.000,I'm happy that you've come to visit the school with me.
00:03:43.041,00:03:45.542,"- Hello, Mrs. Tiger."
00:03:45.583,00:03:47.166,"- Hi, Teacher Harriet."
00:03:47.208,00:03:52.125,"- Uh-oh, did you forget to bring Daniel Tiger to school with you?"
00:03:52.166,00:03:55.667,Harriet... I'm right here!
00:03:55.709,00:04:00.667,"- Oh! There you are, Daniel."
00:04:00.709,00:04:02.917,- Nice to meet you too.
00:04:02.959,00:04:05.917,"- Why don't you take a look around, explore a little?"
00:04:16.375,00:04:18.709,...they have brushes and paint.
00:04:18.750,00:04:22.166,I LOVE painting.
00:04:27.000,00:04:28.959,Let's make-believe...
00:04:29.000,00:04:34.083,"that everything in the classroom says, Hello!"
00:05:07.417,00:05:11.500,- Wasn't that grr-ific?
00:05:11.542,00:05:18.542,"- Daniel, I need to get the classroom ready for when school starts."
00:05:18.583,00:05:21.875,- Hmm...
00:05:21.917,00:05:24.166,Will you help too?
00:05:26.166,00:05:28.000,Grrreat!
00:05:36.917,00:05:39.834,- I know that song!
00:05:39.875,00:05:43.458,- The first thing we do in school... is music time.
00:05:43.500,00:05:47.125,"At music time, we learn and play with instruments."
00:05:47.166,00:05:49.709,Will you help me test out the instruments to see if they work?
00:05:49.750,00:05:52.917,- OK.
00:06:02.041,00:06:04.083,- Nice moves!
00:06:04.125,00:06:08.333,- A drum! Drum with me!
00:06:08.375,00:06:10.500,"Boom, boom, boom!"
00:06:10.542,00:06:13.917,"Heyyy, this is just like my drum!"
00:06:13.959,00:06:20.250,"Mom, I don't need my drum at school. School has one. Here."
00:06:26.291,00:06:31.458,Next at school we have reading time.
00:06:31.500,00:06:34.166,Would you like to go to the reading area?
00:06:34.208,00:06:36.000,- Mm-hmm.
00:06:38.000,00:06:40.959,- See if you can find a book you like.
00:06:41.000,00:06:46.041,- Look at all the books at school! Look!
00:06:46.083,00:06:50.208,There's a Tigey the Adventure Tiger book at school!
00:06:50.250,00:06:54.125,I guess I won't need my Tigey the Adventure Tiger book.
00:06:54.166,00:06:57.083,"Here, Mom!"
00:06:59.000,00:07:03.000,"Now, next at school we go to the block corner to build."
00:07:03.041,00:07:05.542,Shall we?
00:07:08.625,00:07:15.959,"- OK, helper Daniel, I need to know if these blocks are good for building."
00:07:16.000,00:07:19.291,- I'm a good builder.
00:07:19.333,00:07:22.417,"Hello, blocks! We're going to build with you now."
00:07:22.458,00:07:26.834,"Let's build a really tall tower, OK?"
00:07:26.875,00:07:31.959,One... two... three...
00:07:32.000,00:07:37.166,four... five... six...
00:07:37.208,00:07:42.333,seven... eight... nine...
00:07:42.375,00:07:47.000,ten! Uh-oh!
00:07:49.625,00:07:53.041,- Yes! A red one. Eleven!
00:07:53.083,00:07:55.041,Do you see that red block?
00:07:57.667,00:08:01.250,School has my favourite red block!
00:08:03.959,00:08:05.709,"- Ooh, thank you!"
00:08:05.750,00:08:09.208,- Look! It's a skyscraper!
00:08:09.250,00:08:12.959,- It is tall!
00:08:13.000,00:08:16.542,The blocks are good for building. Check!
00:08:16.583,00:08:19.208,- Ha! Ha! Anything else I can help with?
00:08:19.250,00:08:21.917,- Daniel... you can help ME!
00:08:24.709,00:08:27.834,"- Sorry, Mom."
00:08:27.875,00:08:32.458,I'm happy that school has everything you need to learn and play.
00:08:32.500,00:08:35.417,"- Yeah, it does."
00:08:35.458,00:08:38.667,Except... Tigey!
00:08:38.709,00:08:40.959,School DOESN'T have a Tigey.
00:08:41.000,00:08:43.417,I don't want to be at school without Tigey.
00:08:51.125,00:08:54.500,"Tigey, would you want to come to school with Daniel?"
00:08:54.542,00:08:57.583,At school we play with instruments...
00:08:57.625,00:09:01.291,"- And read books, and build with blocks."
00:09:01.333,00:09:05.166,Tigey says yes.
00:09:05.208,00:09:08.583,"- You are welcome, Daniel Tiger."
00:09:32.375,00:10:12.417,"and make sure you've grown - Mom, can I come back to school?"
00:10:12.458,00:10:16.709,"- Yes, of course you can come back to school!"
00:10:16.750,00:10:18.709,- I'm glad you liked school.
00:10:18.750,00:10:20.959,And thank you for being my helper.
00:10:21.000,00:10:24.667,- You're welcome.
00:10:24.709,00:10:27.333,"- Oh! Hello, Lady Elaine."
00:10:27.375,00:10:29.375,"- Hi, Miss Elaina!"
00:10:29.417,00:10:32.333,"- Hiya, Daniel."
00:10:39.667,00:10:42.417,"You'll do block time at school, and reading time..."
00:10:42.458,00:10:46.125,- And music time?
00:10:46.166,00:10:48.291,- That sounds GREAT.
00:10:48.333,00:10:50.208,I'm excited! YEAH!
00:10:52.709,00:10:56.208,- Visiting my new school made me feel a lot better about going.
00:10:56.250,00:10:58.208,I'm glad you were there with me.
00:10:58.250,00:11:00.083,Ugga Mugga!
00:11:03.709,00:11:07.166,"Hi, neighbour!"
00:11:07.208,00:11:09.208,See my doctor coat?
00:11:13.667,00:11:15.041,OK!
00:11:20.000,00:11:23.291,"Hi, Tigey."
00:11:23.333,00:11:28.125,"- Oh...excuse me, Doctor, have you seen my little tiger Daniel?"
00:11:28.166,00:11:31.667,"- Mom, I'm not really a doctor."
00:11:31.709,00:11:33.875,I'm your little tiger.
00:11:33.917,00:11:37.875,"- Oh, good! Ugga Mugga!"
00:11:37.917,00:11:40.834,- Funny that you're playing doctor.
00:11:40.875,00:11:44.750,- Because that's where we're going today-- to the doctor for your check-up.
00:11:44.792,00:11:49.125,- But why do I have to go?
00:11:49.166,00:11:51.375,- You are a healthy and strong tiger.
00:11:51.417,00:11:54.166,- Grr!
00:12:04.959,00:12:08.000,- Grr!
00:12:08.041,00:12:09.500,Mm... but...
00:12:09.542,00:12:15.125,"it's just, I'm one stripe scared about going to the doctor's office."
00:12:15.166,00:12:28.458,- Remember: Like go to the doctor.
00:12:34.917,00:12:39.583,"- Well, first, we'll wait in the waiting room."
00:12:34.917,00:12:42.000,I remember you like the waiting room.
00:12:46.834,00:12:49.333,- Books...
00:13:04.417,00:13:06.834,"- One ear, two ear!"
00:13:18.208,00:13:22.333,"- Wait a sec, Mom."
00:13:22.375,00:13:24.333,Tigey wants to know...
00:13:24.375,00:13:27.208,Will I have to get a shot today?
00:13:30.458,00:13:33.834,- Phew! Can Tigey get a check-up too?
00:13:33.875,00:13:36.917,"- Yes, Tigey can get a check-up too."
00:13:36.959,00:13:39.417,- And I want to take our pictures we drew too.
00:13:39.458,00:13:42.709,It's like a book.
00:13:46.250,00:13:49.208,- Thanks!
00:13:49.250,00:13:51.208,- Let's go!
00:13:51.250,00:13:55.959,"- Hi, Trolley! Tigey and I have a check up today with Dr. Anna."
00:13:58.000,00:14:01.208,- Buckle up!
00:14:20.625,00:14:22.375,- Hey!
00:14:22.417,00:14:26.041,The waiting room looks just like the picture we drew in my book.
00:14:26.083,00:14:32.083,"- Yes, and they call this the waiting room because now we have to..."
00:14:38.750,00:14:41.792,- The fish tank!
00:14:41.834,00:14:44.959,"Hi, fishies!"
00:14:45.000,00:14:49.750,Hey! Do you want to make-believe with me while we're waiting?
00:14:52.208,00:14:54.750,that the fish are going to see the doctor too!
00:15:28.166,00:15:30.750,- Wasn't that grr-ific?!
00:15:35.792,00:15:38.959,"Oh, Tigey Tiger?"
00:15:39.041,00:15:41.458,"- Hi, Daniel. I'm Dr. Anna."
00:15:41.500,00:15:45.333,And you must be Tigey.
00:15:45.375,00:15:47.834,"OK, follow me."
00:15:54.959,00:15:59.000,"- OK, let's get you all checked up."
00:15:59.041,00:16:02.542,And I know the doctor's office feels new to you.
00:16:10.041,00:16:12.792,- Hey! That's what my mom says.
00:16:12.834,00:16:16.834,"So, um..."
00:16:16.875,00:16:23.875,"- Well, first, I will listen to your heartbeat with my stethoscope."
00:16:23.917,00:16:27.542,"- Yes, the stethoscope helps me to hear your heartbeat."
00:16:29.417,00:16:31.959,- Tigey says he wants to go first.
00:16:32.000,00:16:34.709,- Oh. OK.
00:16:34.750,00:16:36.709,"Thump, thump, thump."
00:16:36.750,00:16:38.834,"Nice heart, Tigey!"
00:16:38.875,00:16:41.166,And now Daniel.
00:16:43.417,00:16:47.125,"Oh, your heart is strong and healthy!"
00:16:47.166,00:16:53.083,"Daniel, do you want to hear your own heart with the stethoscope?"
00:16:53.125,00:16:55.834,This is cool. Grr!
00:16:55.875,00:17:03.083,My heart sounds like this: thumpetty-thump!
00:17:16.291,00:17:19.917,"So, Dr. Anna, what will you check out next?"
00:17:19.959,00:17:23.375,- I'm going to use my otoscope to check your ears.
00:17:23.417,00:17:26.709,- O... otoscope?
00:17:26.750,00:17:30.750,"Oh, yeah! Mommy drew a picture of one of those in my book."
00:17:33.333,00:17:35.583,"Very nice ears, Tigey."
00:17:35.625,00:17:39.208,"OK, now Daniel."
00:17:39.250,00:17:42.125,- The otoscope tickles a little. Ha! Ha!
00:17:45.333,00:17:48.000,Follow my finger.
00:17:48.041,00:17:52.667,"Well, Daniel, your eyes and ears are clear and healthy!"
00:17:52.709,00:17:56.417,Next... I'm going to check your throat.
00:17:56.458,00:17:58.834,"- Oh, I remember that!"
00:17:58.875,00:18:00.834,- Now open wide.
00:18:00.875,00:18:03.208,- Ahhhhh!
00:18:03.250,00:18:05.583,- Healthy!
00:18:05.625,00:18:10.458,"And, Tigey, well, you have some nice stuffing."
00:18:10.500,00:18:14.333,"Next, I'm going to check your weight on a scale..."
00:18:16.875,00:18:21.083,...and measure you with a ruler.
00:18:23.083,00:18:26.166,"Tigey first, though."
00:18:31.000,00:18:32.750,"And you, Daniel?"
00:18:35.792,00:18:39.625,"Oh, you are a healthy weight and eight stripes tall!"
00:18:39.667,00:18:41.792,"Well, that's two stripes taller than last year!"
00:18:41.834,00:18:46.291,- Grr-ific! I want to be as tall as my dad!
00:18:46.333,00:18:49.834,My Dad is like...
00:18:49.875,00:18:55.041,- That IS tall. I bet he eats lots of fruits and veggies!
00:18:55.083,00:18:58.250,- He does. We both like apples and broccoli!
00:18:58.291,00:19:03.417,"- Me too! Daniel and Tigey, you are both done with your check-up."
00:19:03.458,00:19:07.500,And you get a heart sticker for being such good patients.
00:19:07.542,00:19:08.959,- Grr-ific!
00:19:09.000,00:19:11.834,"Thanks, Dr. Anna."
00:19:11.875,00:19:13.917,"- Thanks, Dr. Anna."
00:19:13.959,00:19:16.959,"Hi, O!"
00:19:17.000,00:19:19.125,"- Hi, X."
00:19:19.166,00:19:22.750,"- Hello, Daniel."
00:19:22.792,00:19:25.458,"- Don't worry, O."
00:19:25.500,00:19:28.417,- What was it like?
00:19:25.500,00:19:31.333,"- Here, O, read the book I made with my mom. It's gonna be OK."
00:19:31.375,00:19:35.959,- Hoo-hoo! A BOOK?
00:19:36.000,00:19:40.083,I love books!
00:19:46.166,00:19:48.750,"Hi, Trolley!"
00:19:48.792,00:19:52.083,I'm nice and healthy!
00:21:09.125,00:21:15.083,- Thanks for coming with me and Tigey for our check-up at the doctor's office.
00:22:00.083,00:22:02.917,Because it's you I like.
00:00:51.208,00:00:54.542,"- Hi, Neighbour! I'm so excited!"
00:00:54.583,00:00:58.834,Today is my turn to take something to school for show and tell!
00:01:03.542,00:01:08.834,Come on! Dad and I made a book to show to the class for show and tell!
00:01:08.875,00:01:12.417,But I have to wait for Mom to go to school.
00:01:19.166,00:01:23.625,- Uh-huh! Today is my show and tell! I can't wait!
00:01:23.667,00:01:26.041,Waiting is hard.
00:01:38.625,00:01:43.333,Like what?
00:01:48.750,00:01:54.000,Trolley! Please take us to school. I have show and tell today!
00:02:06.417,00:02:09.875,We're at school already!
00:02:13.417,00:02:14.834,Don't you think?
00:02:16.792,00:02:20.083,"Thanks, Trolley!"
00:02:20.125,00:02:22.417,- So excited!
00:02:28.125,00:02:31.000,- Bye!
00:02:31.041,00:02:33.333,"Hi, Miss Elaina!"
00:02:33.375,00:02:37.709,"- Good morning, Daniel."
00:02:37.750,00:02:41.709,"- There you go, Miss Elaina!"
00:02:41.750,00:02:45.250,- Teacher Harriet!
00:02:45.291,00:02:49.000,- Ooh! Is it a book?
00:02:49.041,00:02:53.166,- My dad helped me. Do I really have to wait for show and tell?
00:02:53.208,00:02:57.333,"- Yes, you need to wait until show and tell."
00:02:57.375,00:03:00.417,"It's very, very hard to wait."
00:03:06.834,00:03:11.375,- That's what my mom says!
00:03:14.792,00:03:18.583,But what can we do?
00:03:14.792,00:03:21.250,"- You know, playing at science time will make the waiting easier."
00:03:21.291,00:03:25.250,Let's go to the science corner.
00:03:25.291,00:03:27.834,Remember when we went to the Neighbourhood farm?
00:03:25.291,00:03:31.208,"- Meow meow, we went to the farm and learned all about ducks!"
00:03:31.250,00:03:34.542,- And we brought home a duck egg.
00:03:34.583,00:03:38.750,- But we've been waiting a long time for a baby duck to come out of the egg.
00:03:50.125,00:03:52.917,"- Wait, Miss Elaina!"
00:03:50.125,00:03:56.333,The crack means that the baby duck is trying to get out of the egg!
00:03:56.375,00:04:00.458,"- That's right, O. The duck is trying to get out of the egg."
00:04:00.500,00:04:03.750,And it's called 'hatching'.
00:04:03.792,00:04:07.291,- The baby duck is hatching out of the egg?!
00:04:07.333,00:04:12.333,"So now, we have to wait."
00:04:12.375,00:04:20.083,"- Yes, but if we wait long enough, we will get to see a baby duck hatch out of the egg!"
00:04:20.125,00:04:24.917,"- Seeing a baby duck hatch would be grr-ific! Ha, ha!"
00:04:32.917,00:04:38.125,- What can we do while we wait?
00:04:47.667,00:04:52.125,- How about we play a quacking game while we wait?
00:04:56.542,00:05:00.917,"- You quack, too! Okay? Two..."
00:05:08.208,00:05:12.000,- Five!
00:05:12.041,00:05:15.083,- Okay! Let's look at the egg!
00:05:17.333,00:05:21.041,Hmm... Still nothing.
00:05:26.417,00:05:31.667,"- Look, look, look!"
00:05:31.709,00:05:34.834,The egg stopped moving.
00:05:34.875,00:05:36.875,More waiting.
00:06:07.917,00:06:11.959,- Look!
00:06:23.583,00:06:28.959,- Wooow!
00:06:32.750,00:06:37.083,The baby duck needs quiet!
00:06:37.125,00:06:42.375,- Wow!
00:06:42.417,00:06:46.083,- How fluffy!
00:06:51.333,00:06:55.583,- Welcome to the Neighbourhood of Make Believe!
00:06:58.834,00:07:01.375,Look!
00:07:01.417,00:07:05.083,The baby duck is going to sleep!
00:07:05.125,00:07:08.792,- That was a lot of work to hatch out of your shell!
00:07:12.291,00:07:17.625,Hey! Do you want to make believe with me?
00:07:17.667,00:07:24.125,Let's make believe that we can play with the baby duck on the farm!
00:07:56.750,00:08:00.709,Wasn't that grrr-ific?
00:08:00.750,00:08:03.500,"- Quack, quack! Quack!"
00:08:03.542,00:08:06.125,"- Okay, class."
00:08:06.166,00:08:09.750,- Quack! I mean yeah! Woohoo!
00:08:09.792,00:08:14.750,"I waited, and waited, and now it's show and tell time, yeah!"
00:08:14.792,00:08:18.375,Playing and imagining made waiting easier!
00:08:18.417,00:08:22.458,"- Today, Daniel is going to be our show and tell leader."
00:08:22.500,00:08:26.583,"What do you have for us, Daniel?"
00:08:26.625,00:08:30.709,a book I made with my dad!
00:08:30.750,00:08:42.583,I went to Baker Aker's bakery and picked out a Tiger birthday cake. Katerina and O helped me make stripes on the Tiger cake.
00:08:46.166,00:08:49.625,"When I got home, the cake was smooshed."
00:08:49.667,00:08:53.792,But... the cake still tasted good! Yeah!
00:08:53.834,00:08:57.083,Happy birthday to me! The end!
00:08:57.125,00:08:59.792,- Wow!
00:08:59.834,00:09:07.583,"- I like how you made the book, meow meow!"
00:09:07.625,00:09:09.834,"Nice job, Daniel."
00:09:13.709,00:09:17.792,"- It was very, very hard to wait."
00:10:38.000,00:10:42.166,"- Oh! Hee, hee!"
00:10:38.000,00:10:47.041,"Ooh, you are too cute, yes you are!"
00:10:49.792,00:10:54.917,"Do you play, sing or imagine anything while you wait?"
00:10:54.959,00:10:58.291,I'm glad you waited and saw my show and tell!
00:10:58.333,00:11:01.458,Quack! Ugga-Mugga!
00:11:07.250,00:11:10.667,"- Hi, Neighbour! It's me, Daniel Tiger!"
00:11:10.709,00:11:18.792,"We're having dinner at the Neighbourhood Restaurant tonight, and you're coming with us. Okay?"
00:11:14.208,00:11:22.917,"- Okay, Tiger family. Katerina and her mom are meeting us at the Neighbourhood Restaurant."
00:11:22.959,00:11:25.625,So let's get going!
00:11:25.667,00:11:30.000,- So excited! Trolley!
00:11:30.041,00:11:34.375,Hey! Where's trolley?
00:11:34.417,00:11:39.417,- Wait for Trolley?
00:11:39.458,00:11:42.208,- Hmm. I have to wait.
00:11:42.250,00:11:46.583,Waiting... waiting...
00:11:46.625,00:11:53.166,"- No, not yet. Now, I know it can be hard to wait, especially when you're excited! But..."
00:11:56.667,00:12:01.083,It'll make the waiting feel easier.
00:12:07.750,00:12:12.000,Hmm. So what can we do while we wait?
00:12:16.583,00:12:19.542,- How about a pretending game?
00:12:16.583,00:12:23.250,"You pretend to be something, and we'll guess what it is."
00:12:23.291,00:12:27.709,What am I pretending to be?
00:12:27.750,00:12:30.667,Ooh-ooh! Aaah-aah!
00:12:37.709,00:12:40.583,- Ribbit... ribbit...
00:12:40.625,00:12:44.250,- What is my dad pretending to be?
00:12:44.291,00:12:47.875,Ribbit... ribbit!
00:12:47.917,00:12:52.583,- I am a frog! Your turn!
00:12:56.834,00:12:59.125,"Giddy up, horsey!"
00:12:59.166,00:13:02.041,Trolley's here!
00:13:02.083,00:13:05.542,The waiting time is done! Yay!
00:13:05.583,00:13:08.583,- Do you think playing our game made the waiting feel easier?
00:13:08.625,00:13:12.709,- It did! It really did!
00:13:15.959,00:13:19.458,"- Trolley, please take us to the Neighbourhood Restaurant."
00:13:24.834,00:13:28.542,"- We will be soon! Here, while we ride, let's sing a little."
00:13:38.583,00:13:42.208,- Here we are!
00:13:42.250,00:13:48.375,- Whoa! Singing on Trolley made waiting to get here easier!
00:13:48.417,00:13:51.542,"Goodbye, Trolley!"
00:13:51.583,00:13:55.041,"- Meow meow, hi, Tigers!"
00:13:58.125,00:14:02.166,Welcome to the Neighbourhood of Make-Believe Restaurant! Please take a seat right over here.
00:14:02.208,00:14:06.417,"- Thank you, Prince Tuesday."
00:14:06.458,00:14:09.959,What are you doing here?
00:14:10.000,00:14:15.291,- A waiter? Does that mean that you wait?
00:14:15.333,00:14:20.125,Being a waiter at a restaurant means: I will be helping you tonight!
00:14:20.166,00:14:24.375,Here are your menus.
00:14:24.417,00:14:27.667,- Thank you.
00:14:27.709,00:14:31.583,"- Meow meow, thank you!"
00:14:31.625,00:14:35.917,"- Okay, kids. Take a look at the menu, and see what you'd like to eat."
00:14:43.667,00:14:46.792,- Oh yeah! The spaghetti and meatballs do look good.
00:14:46.834,00:14:50.208,"- They are yum-yum-yummy in my tum-tum-tummy. Hee, hee!"
00:14:50.250,00:14:53.208,"- Okay, and what kind of sandwich is that?"
00:14:53.250,00:14:56.208,"- It's a cheese sandwich, meow meow."
00:14:56.250,00:14:59.166,And this is chicken and broccoli.
00:14:59.208,00:15:01.625,And don't forget the spaghetti and meatballs.
00:15:06.709,00:15:12.375,"- Hi, so, do you know what you would like to eat tonight?"
00:15:17.250,00:15:20.917,- Royally good choice!
00:15:20.959,00:15:24.333,"- Can I have the chicken and broccoli, please?"
00:15:24.375,00:15:27.667,"And how about you, Mr. and Mrs. Tiger?"
00:15:24.375,00:15:31.792,"- Hm, well, we would both like the vegetable soup and salad."
00:15:31.834,00:15:39.041,"- And I would like to have the grilled fish with spinach, please, meow meow."
00:15:42.959,00:15:46.417,- Thank you!
00:15:52.625,00:15:56.041,More waiting.
00:16:00.417,00:16:03.166,"- Meow meow, waiting is hard."
00:16:03.208,00:16:06.959,"- It is! It's very, very hard to wait."
00:16:07.000,00:16:09.166,"- I know it's hard to wait, but..."
00:16:24.750,00:16:28.208,- Oh! A quiet sit down game.
00:16:28.250,00:16:32.625,"- Meow meow, we could play..."
00:16:32.667,00:16:37.542,- Okay!
00:16:37.583,00:16:42.291,"- Uh-huh! Fork, napkin, ketchup, salt."
00:16:42.333,00:16:48.083,- Now remember all of these things and cover your eyes.
00:16:48.125,00:16:52.875,"- You cover your eyes, too!"
00:16:52.917,00:16:56.959,Now...
00:16:57.000,00:16:59.834,- What's missing?
00:17:02.125,00:17:06.500,The ketchup!
00:17:06.542,00:17:10.750,The ketchup was missing!
00:17:10.792,00:17:15.125,"Remember everything on the table, and now..."
00:17:15.166,00:17:18.542,cover your eyes...
00:17:18.583,00:17:21.667,"Okay, now you can look!"
00:17:32.333,00:17:36.792,"- Hello, I'm Mrs. Salt."
00:17:36.834,00:17:41.083,"- I'm fine, I'm just waiting to pour me on some food!"
00:17:41.125,00:17:45.041,- Me too.
00:17:41.125,00:17:47.375,"Waiting, waiting, to go on some food..."
00:17:47.417,00:17:51.250,"- Excuse me, Dad?"
00:17:51.291,00:17:54.250,"- Not quite yet, Daniel. We have a little more waiting to do."
00:17:54.291,00:17:57.542,- More waiting.
00:18:03.750,00:18:07.291,What if the salt and ketchup could really play with us?
00:18:07.333,00:18:11.041,Heeeey...that gives me an idea!
00:18:11.083,00:18:15.166,"Maybe if we imagine, the waiting will feel easier!"
00:18:15.208,00:18:23.750,Do you want to make believe with me? Let's make believe that the stuff on the table could play with us!
00:19:00.000,00:19:02.750,- Presenting your food!
00:19:02.792,00:19:06.166,- Hey! Imagining did make waiting easier!
00:19:10.542,00:19:14.041,"Thank you, Prince Tuesday!"
00:19:10.542,00:19:17.542,- And fish and spinach for Ms. Pussycat.
00:19:17.583,00:19:21.333,- Chicken and broccoli for little D.
00:19:21.375,00:19:24.125,- Yum-yum-yummy in your tum-tum-tummy!
00:19:24.166,00:19:28.750,Spaghetti and meatballs for Katerina!
00:19:28.792,00:19:33.917,- Mmm. This smells deeeelicious!
00:19:37.709,00:19:40.667,"- You know what, Mom and Dad?"
00:19:40.709,00:19:44.625,Playing a game and using my imagination did make waiting for my food easier!
00:19:44.667,00:19:47.959,Don't you think?
00:20:56.458,00:21:00.333,"- Okay, guess what's missing now!"
00:21:00.375,00:21:03.041,- Broccoli!
00:21:03.083,00:21:07.041,"- I liked going to the restaurant, even though we had to wait."
00:21:10.333,00:21:15.875,"You can play, sing, or imagine anything! Ugga-Mugga."
00:00:46.125,00:00:49.166,- Woah!
00:00:49.208,00:00:52.542,- Meow-meow!
00:00:55.417,00:00:58.583,"- Hi, neighbour. We're playing outside at school today."
00:00:58.625,00:01:01.083,Let's say hi to Ducky!
00:01:01.125,00:01:04.125,"- Ducky just said, Hi, neighbour, too!"
00:01:04.166,00:01:07.166,"- Hello, Ducky!"
00:01:04.166,00:01:09.166,"Best duck in the world, yes, you are!"
00:01:09.208,00:01:11.959,Look! Ha! Ha! Ha!
00:01:12.000,00:01:14.417,Ducky's dancing!
00:01:14.458,00:01:17.959,"- Look at us, Ducky!"
00:01:18.000,00:01:20.208,- Quack!
00:01:22.250,00:01:25.625,I love Ducky.
00:01:25.667,00:01:28.291,"- Quack, quack, quacky!"
00:01:28.333,00:01:30.917,"- Hmmm, it looks like I have a Miss Elaina duck..."
00:01:30.959,00:01:33.125,- Quack!
00:01:33.166,00:01:35.375,- Quacky!
00:01:35.417,00:01:40.583,"- My little ducks, I have something important to tell you about Ducky."
00:01:42.709,00:01:46.333,when she was a little duckling!
00:01:46.375,00:01:49.917,- Ducky was so cuuute!
00:01:54.041,00:01:57.041,- Hoo-hoo! I remember when Ducky was little like that.
00:02:00.208,00:02:02.709,- And grew!
00:02:00.208,00:02:05.625,- You said that we had to take Ducky back to the farm when she got bigger.
00:02:05.667,00:02:08.041,- I did say that.
00:02:05.667,00:02:09.792,And today is the day we're taking her to the farm.
00:02:09.834,00:02:12.250,- Today?
00:02:17.166,00:02:20.417,- Farms have lots of room for ducks to run and play. Hoo-hoo!
00:02:20.458,00:02:25.000,"- But I don't want Ducky to go, hmm..."
00:02:25.041,00:02:28.875,"- Hmph! I want Ducky to stay here, with us!"
00:02:28.917,00:02:31.667,- I'm so sad.
00:02:31.709,00:02:37.000,"- I know you feel sad, Ducky is going away..."
00:02:37.041,00:02:39.000,and you're going to miss her.
00:03:09.250,00:03:13.458,- I'm sad too. I just want to sit here and be sad.
00:03:13.500,00:03:18.333,"- When you're sad, it's OK if you want to be by yourself for a little while."
00:03:18.375,00:03:22.542,"- Sometimes when I feel sad, making a picture helps me feel better."
00:03:22.583,00:03:26.208,"- That's a nice suggestion, O."
00:03:26.250,00:03:29.875,"- OK, I'll make a picture."
00:03:29.917,00:03:32.041,- I'm going to go and tell the others about Ducky.
00:03:32.083,00:03:35.875,"- I'll come with you, hoo-hoo!"
00:03:44.250,00:03:46.250,"- Hi, Daniel."
00:03:48.375,00:03:50.750,- Yeah... I'm sad.
00:03:54.208,00:03:58.583,Here's Ducky's fuzzy body...
00:03:58.625,00:04:02.542,"- Hoo-hoo-hoo, such a soft and fluffy Ducky. Ha! Ha!"
00:04:02.583,00:04:06.417,- And here are her orange feet...
00:04:06.458,00:04:09.000,"- So she can waddle, waddle, waddle!"
00:04:09.041,00:04:11.000,"- Waddle, waddle, waddle..."
00:04:11.041,00:04:13.542,"- You forgot her beak! So she can quack, quack, quaaack!"
00:04:13.583,00:04:15.542,- Oh yeah!
00:04:15.583,00:04:17.959,"Quack, quack!"
00:04:20.000,00:04:22.125,"- You are a quacky little duck, Ducky! Quack!"
00:04:22.166,00:04:24.375,Ducky's so funny.
00:04:24.417,00:04:26.375,"Waddle, waddle, waddle."
00:04:26.417,00:04:28.291,I'm gonna miss Ducky.
00:04:28.333,00:04:30.667,I really wish she could stay here at school.
00:04:30.709,00:04:39.583,- Hey! What if Ducky had a backpack and a cubby and did all the things in school that we do?
00:04:39.625,00:04:42.458,"You'd like that, wouldn't you, Ducky?"
00:04:42.500,00:04:46.417,- Do you want to make believe with me?
00:04:46.458,00:04:48.834,Let's make believe...
00:04:48.875,00:04:53.500,that Ducky is going to school with us!
00:05:24.000,00:05:27.458,It would be fun if Ducky went to school with us.
00:05:30.625,00:05:36.125,I still feel sad she has to go to the farm.
00:05:36.166,00:05:39.208,"- Hi, Miss Elaina, I'm still sad."
00:05:39.250,00:05:41.625,"- Me too, hmm!"
00:05:41.667,00:05:43.917,- Remember what Teacher Harriet said?
00:06:08.709,00:06:12.166,"- Miss Elaina, come look at the picture I drew of Ducky."
00:06:12.208,00:06:15.208,Drawing it made me feel a little bit better.
00:06:15.250,00:06:17.834,"Quack-a-morning, Miss Elaina."
00:06:23.000,00:06:25.250,- I'm glad you feel a little better.
00:06:25.291,00:06:28.125,I do too.
00:06:28.166,00:06:30.417,- I'm coming!
00:06:39.041,00:06:41.667,- OK!
00:06:41.709,00:06:45.375,- Say... Duckyyyyy!
00:06:49.000,00:06:51.000,- I've never been to the farm before!
00:06:51.041,00:06:53.959,"- I have, it has a pond!"
00:06:51.041,00:06:56.166,"- Come on, Ducky, let's get you to the farm!"
00:06:56.208,00:06:59.500,Here we go!
00:06:59.542,00:07:03.083,- Come sit by me.
00:07:03.125,00:07:05.458,- I bet ducky is excited to go to the farm.
00:07:05.500,00:07:11.625,"- Daniel, Miss Elaina, would you like to sit with me, and near Ducky?"
00:07:11.667,00:07:13.709,- Yeah.
00:07:13.750,00:07:16.750,- In you go.
00:07:16.792,00:07:20.041,- OK!
00:07:32.917,00:07:35.125,- Wow!
00:07:35.166,00:07:38.166,- Here we are at the farm.
00:07:38.208,00:07:40.875,- Ducky's new home.
00:07:40.917,00:07:43.333,- Ah! Look!
00:07:55.083,00:07:57.709,"Let's watch Ducky swim, OK?"
00:07:57.750,00:08:00.500,"It's OK, Ducky, go swim with your new friends."
00:08:00.542,00:08:03.542,- We think you will like this pond a lot.
00:08:05.625,00:08:08.375,"- Look, Ducky is making friends already!"
00:08:08.417,00:08:11.000,They're splashing each other!
00:08:11.041,00:08:14.583,- They're playing!
00:08:14.625,00:08:18.291,- Yeah... and seeing Ducky happy makes me happy.
00:08:21.917,00:08:25.709,But I sure am going to miss her.
00:08:25.750,00:08:28.166,Friends can help you feel less sad.
00:09:45.250,00:09:47.417,- Look at me!
00:09:47.458,00:09:50.000,- Watch me!
00:09:50.041,00:09:54.250,"- It's time to say goodbye to Ducky, so we can head back to school."
00:09:54.291,00:09:57.709,"- Bye-bye, Ducky."
00:10:01.542,00:10:03.959,Soft and fluffy!
00:10:04.000,00:10:06.458,"- So long, Ducky."
00:10:04.000,00:10:09.792,I'm glad I knew you ever since you were a little egg. Remember how we waited?
00:10:09.834,00:10:12.583,- And waited and waited.
00:10:12.625,00:10:15.041,And then she popped out of her egg!
00:10:15.083,00:10:17.083,Aaah... that was a good day.
00:10:17.125,00:10:19.458,"Bye-bye, Ducky."
00:10:19.500,00:10:22.291,I'm sad you have to go.
00:10:22.333,00:10:26.000,"- Bye, Ducky. You're the best duck in the world!"
00:10:26.041,00:10:28.625,"Yes, you are!"
00:10:26.041,00:10:32.125,- We can come back to the farm and visit Ducky sometimes too.
00:10:35.041,00:10:36.750,- I'll be next to Ducky!
00:10:36.792,00:10:39.166,- Say... Duckyyyy!
00:10:39.208,00:10:41.542,- Meow-meow!
00:10:43.667,00:10:48.542,"- I was sad to say goodbye to Ducky, but I feel better now."
00:10:48.583,00:10:49.667,Do you ever feel sad?
00:10:51.667,00:10:53.667,What helps you feel better?
00:11:03.583,00:11:05.667,"- Hi, Prince Tuesday!"
00:11:05.709,00:11:09.959,"Hi, neighbour! Dad and I just got some groceries for dinner."
00:11:10.000,00:11:11.959,Tigey wants to know what's for dinner.
00:11:12.000,00:11:15.333,"- Well, Tigey, I'm glad you asked. We're having..."
00:11:17.792,00:11:21.458,"- No, Tigey, no! I am not a tasty dinner!"
00:11:21.500,00:11:23.834,- I guess we can just make salad.
00:11:23.875,00:11:25.917,And Mom is making chicken too.
00:11:25.959,00:11:27.917,We'd better get home quick!
00:11:27.959,00:11:29.959,- Let's go.
00:11:30.000,00:11:32.959,- See you later. On you go.
00:11:33.000,00:11:35.166,"- Trolley, please take us home for dinner."
00:11:43.417,00:11:46.542,"- Dad, look!"
00:11:46.583,00:11:48.625,O and Katerina are playing outside!
00:11:48.667,00:11:51.834,Can we stop and say hi?
00:11:48.667,00:11:53.792,"- Well... OK, but just for a little bit."
00:11:55.834,00:11:58.291,- OK!
00:11:58.333,00:12:01.041,- Come say hi to O and Katerina with me!
00:12:01.083,00:12:03.041,"- Well hello there, Tigers."
00:12:03.083,00:12:05.917,How in the world are ya?

00:12:17.333,00:12:19.750,"- Hi, friends!"
00:12:19.792,00:12:22.333,When did you get here?
00:12:22.375,00:12:25.917,My dad and I just got off Trolley. We're on our way home for dinner.
00:12:25.959,00:12:27.792,"- Oh, hoo-hoo!"
00:12:29.917,00:12:32.208,- Wow!
00:12:29.917,00:12:35.792,"- And, meow-meow, we made our antennae too."
00:12:35.834,00:12:39.458,Uncle X told us.
00:12:35.834,00:12:41.583,"- Wow! You have the same wings, and the same antennae."
00:12:41.625,00:12:45.250,"- Hoooo, and watch how fast we can fly! Hoo-hoo!"
00:12:50.000,00:12:53.959,- O and Katerina were playing all day today without me.
00:12:54.000,00:12:58.250,"Huh... I wish I got to play ladybug all day, too."
00:12:58.291,00:13:00.750,- Ladybug powerrrr!
00:13:00.792,00:13:03.667,"- Hoo-hoo! Fly, ladybugs, fly!"

00:13:20.625,00:13:23.959,- Oh! That was a really good ladybug song.
00:13:24.000,00:13:26.667,"- Meow-meow, thanks!"
00:13:26.709,00:13:30.583,- And we practiced it all day together. Hoo-hoo!
00:13:30.625,00:13:33.250,- You really got to play together all day?
00:13:35.291,00:13:37.250,"We can play together all the time, see?"
00:13:37.291,00:13:39.250,We live in the same tree house.
00:13:39.291,00:13:41.333,- Too bad you couldn't play with us Daniel.
00:13:41.375,00:13:44.875,It would have been fun.
00:13:44.917,00:13:47.917,- Hoo-hoo!
00:13:47.959,00:13:50.834,"- Well, Daniel, next time we play you can be..."

00:13:59.083,00:14:02.125,- I wish I got to play with Katerina and O today.
00:14:02.166,00:14:04.750,- Hoo-hoo-hoo!
00:14:04.792,00:14:07.917,How would you feel if your friends were playing without you?
00:14:09.917,00:14:15.041,"I was left out, and that makes me feel... sad."
00:14:15.083,00:14:17.959,"- Alright, Daniel, let's go."
00:14:21.875,00:14:24.583,- Together!
00:14:24.625,00:14:26.583,"- Bye, Daniel!"
00:14:26.625,00:14:30.083,- See hoo soon!
00:14:30.125,00:14:32.250,"- Are you, alright, Daniel?"
00:14:32.291,00:14:37.291,"Because I'm looking at your face, and your mouth is making a sad frown."
00:14:37.333,00:14:40.125,You can tell me whatever you're feeling.
00:14:40.166,00:14:42.542,"- Well, I feel sad."
00:14:42.583,00:14:44.792,- Why do you feel sad?
00:14:44.834,00:14:48.417,- O and Katerina were playing together all day today...
00:15:02.875,00:15:05.625,- But... I don't want to feel sad.
00:15:05.667,00:15:08.667,"- We all feel sad sometimes, Daniel."
00:15:08.709,00:15:10.875,- Even you?
00:15:10.917,00:15:12.875,- Even me.
00:15:24.917,00:15:27.583,I feel a little better.
00:15:32.750,00:15:36.041,"Trolley, please take us home for dinner."
00:15:41.500,00:15:44.417,- O and Katerina were having dinner together too.
00:15:44.458,00:15:49.333,And they live in the same tree house so they play together all the time!
00:15:51.834,00:15:55.875,- Ohhh... it sounds like you're feeling left out.
00:15:55.917,00:16:00.667,- I was left out.
00:16:39.750,00:16:41.709,"- You know what, Dad?"
00:16:41.750,00:16:44.333,I liked singing a sad song.
00:16:44.375,00:16:48.250,I feel a little better.
00:16:48.291,00:16:51.208,"Thanks, Trolley."
00:16:53.709,00:16:56.750,- I think I like singing about my feelings.
00:16:56.792,00:17:00.125,Do you want to sing about your feelings too?
00:17:00.166,00:17:02.917,Heeey... that gives me an idea.
00:17:02.959,00:17:07.458,What if everything was singing about the sad song?
00:17:44.250,00:17:46.208,come for dinner!
00:17:46.250,00:17:48.458,- Coming!
00:17:48.500,00:17:51.709,"- Look, Mom, we have the veggies to make a salad."
00:17:54.583,00:17:56.291,"- OK, Daniel, let's wash up before we cook."
00:17:56.333,00:17:58.333,"- OK, Dad!"
00:17:58.375,00:18:00.583,"Washa, washa, washa!"
00:18:00.625,00:18:03.250,- You got my favourite veggies!
00:18:03.291,00:18:06.208,"- Lettuce, carrots, bell peppers..."
00:18:06.250,00:18:08.917,- Bell peppers are Katerina's favourite!
00:18:08.959,00:18:11.083,Wanna rip up the lettuce?
00:18:11.125,00:18:13.166,- OK!
00:18:13.208,00:18:20.166,"- Not at all. In fact, we had time to stop at O the Owl and Katerina's house on the way home."
00:18:20.208,00:18:22.625,"- So, what were O and Katerina doing today?"
00:18:22.667,00:18:25.000,"- Well, they were playing ladybugs together."
00:18:25.041,00:18:27.000,They had ladybug wings...
00:18:27.041,00:18:30.041,and ladybug antennae...
00:18:30.083,00:18:32.291,and a ladybug song.
00:18:34.917,00:18:37.125,"- All day, huh?"
00:18:37.166,00:18:44.625,"- Yes, and O and Katerina play together all the time and I was left out!"
00:18:44.667,00:18:47.917,"- Aw, Daniel, it is hard to be left out."
00:19:04.291,00:19:07.375,- And do you know what else helps when you're feeling sad?
00:19:07.417,00:19:11.041,- What?
00:19:11.083,00:19:13.250,- Family hug! Ha! Ha!
00:19:13.291,00:19:17.000,"- OK, OK, I don't feel so sad anymore."
00:19:29.458,00:19:34.333,And I'm starting to feel better and better and better and better!
00:19:58.417,00:20:00.750,it won't always be bad!
00:20:39.291,00:20:42.166,"- Hm, what's that, Tigey?"
00:20:42.208,00:20:45.709,- Oh yeah!
00:20:45.750,00:20:48.083,- What?
00:20:45.750,00:20:50.041,- Tigey wants some yummy Daniel Tiger for dinner!
00:20:50.083,00:20:54.083,"- OK, OK. Well then, maybe we should eat!"
00:20:54.125,00:20:56.500,Let's have some dinner!
00:20:56.542,00:20:58.500,- Dad!
00:20:58.542,00:21:00.750,the chicken.
00:21:00.792,00:21:08.875,- I was feeling sad today because I didn't get to play with O and Katerina. When was a time when you were sad?
00:21:08.917,00:21:12.000,It's OK to feel sad sometimes.
00:21:59.542,00:22:01.291,Because it's you I like.
00:00:56.208,00:00:58.750,We're playing at Katerina Kittycat's house today.
00:00:58.792,00:01:03.083,"- Hello, Daniel Tiger, meow, meow. Hi, neighbour."
00:01:06.667,00:01:09.875,"Goodbye, Trolley."

00:01:19.583,00:01:22.542,"- Daniel, come inside."
00:01:22.583,00:01:25.542,I made it all by myself.
00:01:25.583,00:01:27.917,"- Meow, meow, we'll be upstairs, Mommy."
00:01:27.959,00:01:30.166,"- Oh, OK, meow, meow."

00:02:19.166,00:02:21.542,- A party blower?
00:02:21.583,00:02:23.750,I'm having fun already.
00:02:30.625,00:02:35.208,"- Meow, meow, let's sit down, Daniel. You sit heeeere..."
00:02:35.250,00:02:37.041,"Oh, no. Meow, meow."
00:02:37.083,00:02:40.542,"Daniel, you need a chair."
00:02:40.583,00:02:43.166,I'll get my big chair from over there.
00:02:43.208,00:02:46.041,And you can get that one too.
00:02:46.083,00:02:48.792,Here it is.
00:02:48.834,00:02:51.750,"Oh, this chair is heavy!"
00:02:51.792,00:02:53.959,- Do you want me to help you?
00:02:58.583,00:03:01.333,Whoa!

00:03:08.959,00:03:11.542,on the floor.
00:03:15.625,00:03:17.917,- Ruined. Grr.
00:03:19.583,00:03:22.917,"- Katerina, meow, meow, how's the party going?"
00:03:22.959,00:03:26.583,I brought you some napkins...
00:03:26.625,00:03:30.500,"What happened, meow, meow?"
00:03:26.625,00:03:34.000,"- Oh, meow, meow, I ruined the party. See?"
00:03:34.041,00:03:37.333,Mr. Monkey's party is on the floor.
00:03:37.375,00:03:40.709,"- Oh, meow, meow, that is upsetting."
00:03:40.750,00:03:44.417,- I just wanted to make a birthday party for Mr. Monkey.
00:03:44.458,00:03:47.417,"Meow, meow. I'm so sad."

00:03:49.709,00:03:52.750,"- Meow, meow. Oh..."
00:03:55.000,00:03:58.333,It took me so long to make the party all by myself.
00:03:58.375,00:04:01.417,"- And you did a good job, meow, meow."
00:04:01.458,00:04:05.041,"But now your friend Daniel is here, so he can help you."
00:04:09.583,00:04:16.000,"- Will you help me fix Mr. Monkey's party, Daniel, meow, meow?"
00:04:16.041,00:04:20.166,"- And with a friend helping you, you'll have it done lickety-split."
00:04:23.959,00:04:27.709,"- I know, let's play a game."
00:04:27.750,00:04:35.500,"- Here's the circle cup, but where's the circle plate?"
00:04:35.542,00:04:39.458,- Mm-hmm. Where is the circle plate?
00:04:54.750,00:04:57.250,I found the diamond cup.
00:04:59.667,00:05:01.041,Hmm...
00:05:03.291,00:05:06.083,There it is right there!
00:05:06.125,00:05:08.709,- We're almost done!
00:05:08.750,00:05:12.333,OK. Now I have the heart cup.
00:05:12.375,00:05:14.333,- Where's the heart plate?
00:05:14.375,00:05:15.750,Um...
00:05:18.000,00:05:23.875,Here's the heart plate. Grr!
00:05:23.917,00:05:27.041,"Hugs, meow, meow."
00:05:33.625,00:05:36.542,- Here's the triangle plate and saucer.
00:05:36.583,00:05:39.041,Those are for Beary Bear.
00:05:41.333,00:05:43.959,And I brought you some special tea.
00:05:44.000,00:05:46.041,- Did you put water in there?
00:05:46.083,00:05:49.000,- I did.
00:05:49.041,00:05:51.834,Daniel would you like some pretend tea?
00:05:51.875,00:05:55.208,- OK. I want some pretend tea.
00:05:59.000,00:06:02.125,"- Napkin in lap, clap, clap, clap."
00:06:08.792,00:06:10.959,"- OK, I'll pour it for you."
00:06:11.000,00:06:14.291,I want to do it all by myself.
00:06:17.625,00:06:19.792,Whoops! Phew.
00:06:19.834,00:06:24.208,"Princess Penelope Pinky Pink Pig, would you like some tea?"
00:06:24.250,00:06:26.709,"- Yes, please."
00:06:31.500,00:06:34.250,Grr-ific!
00:06:37.583,00:06:41.500,"- Oh, yes, one second, Beary Bear. Here you go."
00:06:41.542,00:06:44.625,"- Nyum, nyum, nyum. Agh."
00:06:44.667,00:06:48.500,Best tea ever!
00:06:48.542,00:06:52.333,- Oh. I have to get one more thing.
00:06:52.375,00:06:55.375,- This birthday tea party is so much fun.
00:06:55.417,00:06:58.500,"I hope you're having a fun birthday, Mr. Monkey."
00:06:58.542,00:07:02.041,Ha! Ha! Ha!
00:07:02.083,00:07:05.166,"Hey, I have an idea."
00:07:05.208,00:07:07.917,Do you want to make believe with me?
00:07:10.375,00:07:15.083,that all the tea party friends are... real!
00:07:53.166,00:07:55.125,- I'm back.
00:07:55.166,00:07:58.500,I've got banana muffins for our tea.
00:08:00.834,00:08:02.792,"- Oh, yes, please."
00:08:09.458,00:08:11.083,"Oh, no, meow, meow."
00:08:11.125,00:08:15.709,"Meow, meow."
00:08:20.875,00:08:23.333,"- I think I can help, Katerina."
00:08:28.542,00:08:32.250,"- It's OK. I'll help you clean it up, because..."
00:08:39.792,00:08:42.959,"OK, let's clean it up together."
00:08:50.166,00:08:53.375,"- Daniel, I'm glad you're my friend."
00:08:57.583,00:08:59.959,"- Hugs, Daniel."
00:09:00.000,00:09:03.166,"- You're welcome, Katerina."
00:09:03.208,00:09:07.166,"Hmm, how can I help?"
00:09:07.208,00:09:10.166,"Hey, I'll hold the cup while you pour."
00:09:10.208,00:09:13.333,"- Thanks, Daniel, meow, meow."
00:09:15.583,00:09:19.166,- Mmm. This tea is yummy.
00:09:19.208,00:09:22.583,"- Meow, meow, yes."
00:09:22.625,00:09:26.125,"- Yes, this tea is delicious."
00:10:34.458,00:10:37.667,"- Ooh-ooh, ah-ah!"
00:10:37.709,00:10:42.917,"- Meow, meow, I'm glad Daniel helped fix it for you, Mr. Monkey."
00:10:42.959,00:10:46.709,"- Me too. Ooh-ooh, ah-ah!"
00:10:49.041,00:10:52.959,Wasn't that tea party fun?
00:11:08.667,00:11:11.750,"Hi, neighbour! We're playing with O the Owl today."
00:11:11.792,00:11:15.000,"- Hoo-hoo. Hi, Daniel."
00:11:15.041,00:11:17.875,"- Hi, O."
00:11:17.917,00:11:19.750,Hoo-hoo! I'm here. Ugh!
00:11:23.041,00:11:25.875,How in the world are you?
00:11:30.000,00:11:32.792,- Excellent idea.
00:11:30.000,00:11:34.458,I'm sure you'll have fun and learn something new.
00:11:34.500,00:11:37.000,- Come on!
00:11:43.500,00:11:45.750,"- Thanks, Daniel."
00:11:45.792,00:11:47.458,- Grr-ific!
00:11:47.500,00:11:50.000,"Boy, O, you sure do like books."
00:11:56.875,00:11:59.583,Want to learn about dogs?
00:11:59.625,00:12:01.583,Want to learn about trains?
00:12:01.625,00:12:04.166,Hoo-hoo!
00:12:04.208,00:12:07.041,Want to learn about bugs?
00:12:11.250,00:12:14.083,"Ooh, here's another."
00:12:21.125,00:12:23.875,"- Uh-oh, O. The books, they're going to fall!"
00:12:23.917,00:12:27.041,Want some help?
00:12:27.083,00:12:31.000,It's OK. I've got it now.
00:12:31.041,00:12:33.250,A dinosaur book!
00:12:33.291,00:12:35.583,I want to learn about that.
00:12:35.625,00:12:37.583,The books!
00:12:42.625,00:12:45.375,- I dropped my books on the floor.
00:12:59.709,00:13:01.959,The two of you can work together.
00:13:06.041,00:13:11.500,"Daniel, hoo-hoo, uh, will you help me put my books away?"
00:13:18.083,00:13:21.000,The train book should go with the other train books.
00:13:25.583,00:13:27.166,There!
00:13:27.208,00:13:29.792,It goes here with the other train books.
00:13:31.625,00:13:33.667,Here's one.
00:13:38.417,00:13:40.166,Where are the dog books?
00:13:44.291,00:13:47.166,Here they are.
00:13:55.500,00:14:00.125,"Oh, yeah, it goes here with the other bug books."
00:14:02.166,00:14:04.667,"Thanks for helping me put all my books away, Daniel."
00:14:04.709,00:14:06.709,You're a good friend.
00:14:15.625,00:14:18.166,Why don't you read this one?
00:14:21.333,00:14:24.959,But I can't read.
00:14:25.000,00:14:27.834,I'll read it to you.
00:14:27.875,00:14:29.458,"- Thanks, O."
00:14:29.500,00:14:32.125,- Let me know if you like it.
00:14:32.166,00:14:34.709,- OK.
00:14:34.750,00:14:38.208,"Oh, uh... Daniel."
00:14:38.250,00:14:41.125,- I read my books in my book-reading nest.
00:14:41.166,00:14:44.542,"- Ooh, nice nest."
00:14:44.583,00:14:46.875,This is cozy.
00:14:46.917,00:14:51.667,- Hoo-hoo! I love books.
00:14:51.709,00:14:54.667,Once upon a time...
00:14:54.709,00:14:56.792,- I love this part.
00:14:56.834,00:15:00.709,- Heh! Heh! Me too.
00:15:02.959,00:15:05.083,- Look at Dusty the dinosaur.
00:15:07.417,00:15:11.041,- Oh. I'm glad he's a friendly dinosaur.
00:15:11.083,00:15:15.375,- Dusty lived with his mommy and his daddy dinosaur.
00:15:15.417,00:15:17.000,Hoo-hoo!
00:15:17.041,00:15:20.417,Dusty the friendly dinosaur liked to play.
00:15:20.458,00:15:22.500,- I like to play too.
00:15:22.542,00:15:25.750,I wonder what Dusty liked to play.
00:15:25.792,00:15:29.250,"Hey, do you want to make-believe with me?"
00:15:31.875,00:15:36.917,that we could play with Dusty the friendly dinosaur.
00:15:50.792,00:15:53.583,- Whoaaaa!
00:16:07.208,00:16:11.375,- Wasn't that grr-ific?
00:16:11.417,00:16:13.375,"So, what happens next?"
00:16:13.417,00:16:16.291,- Let's see.
00:16:16.333,00:16:20.125,"One day, Dusty took a walk in the woods."
00:16:20.166,00:16:23.250,Dusty was having fun smelling the flowers...
00:16:27.583,00:16:31.500,"- Oh, that Dusty. He's going to have to take a bath."
00:16:33.166,00:16:37.667,"- Dusty played all day, until it was time to go home."
00:16:42.000,00:16:44.208,Dusty was scared.
00:16:48.125,00:16:52.125,- Dusty did not know how to get home to his mommy dinosaur.
00:16:52.166,00:16:55.625,- Uh-oh.
00:16:55.667,00:16:58.917,"- Dusty was lost? Oh, no!"
00:16:58.959,00:17:00.959,He needs to go home to his mommy.
00:17:02.834,00:17:05.583,What happens next to Dusty?
00:17:11.250,00:17:13.291,The last page of the book...
00:17:13.333,00:17:16.667,it's gone!
00:17:16.709,00:17:20.667,- I'm sure. See? No last page.
00:17:20.709,00:17:22.667,- But what happens to Dusty?
00:17:22.709,00:17:26.208,- There has to be an ending.
00:17:26.250,00:17:28.750,- We need to know what happens to Dusty.
00:17:35.208,00:17:37.750,I need that page.
00:17:44.834,00:17:49.000,"Hmm, I can help you make up an ending for the story."
00:17:49.041,00:17:52.792,- Make up an ending?
00:17:52.834,00:17:54.625,- Yeah! We can pretend.
00:17:54.667,00:17:57.291,I'll pretend to be Dusty the dinosaur.
00:17:57.333,00:18:00.250,You can pretend to be the dinosaur too.
00:18:00.291,00:18:03.041,You just get on all fours like this.
00:18:03.083,00:18:06.667,I'm Dusty the dinosaur.
00:18:09.625,00:18:11.458,"- Hoo-hoo, no!"
00:18:14.792,00:18:16.834,What happens next?
00:18:16.875,00:18:20.542,- Hmm...
00:18:20.583,00:18:25.667,"Dusty, Dusty, it's me, your mommy dinosaur."
00:18:25.709,00:18:28.000,- Roar! Mommy!
00:18:28.041,00:18:29.625,You found me.
00:18:29.667,00:18:32.083,- I've been looking for you all day.
00:18:32.125,00:18:34.583,- Can we go home and have dinner now?
00:18:34.625,00:18:37.583,"- Yes, we can."
00:18:39.417,00:18:41.000,"Mm, mm, mm."
00:18:41.041,00:18:44.417,- Dusty was not lost.
00:18:44.458,00:18:48.166,Dusty and his mommy went home and had dinosaur dinner.
00:18:48.208,00:18:50.750,- And Dusty never got lost again.
00:18:50.792,00:18:52.750,Never...
00:18:55.041,00:18:58.000,- Never...
00:18:58.041,00:19:00.583,We did it!
00:19:00.625,00:19:03.000,- Hoo-hoo-hoo!
00:19:09.834,00:19:13.333,the end!
00:19:13.375,00:19:15.583,The end!
00:19:15.625,00:19:19.166,- I love that part.
00:19:19.208,00:19:21.625,- Thanks for helping me finish the story.
00:19:21.667,00:19:27.125,"- You're welcome, O."
00:19:30.291,00:19:34.750,"- I've never made up an ending to a story before, but it was really fun."
00:19:34.792,00:19:36.792,- Do you want to make up another story?
00:19:36.834,00:19:38.959,- Nifty-galifty!
00:19:39.000,00:19:41.750,"Um, what should it be about?"
00:19:41.792,00:19:44.333,- About... you and me!
00:20:47.583,00:20:50.583,"- So, how was the book?"

00:03:51.875,00:03:53.875,- Does somebody need a big brother?
00:03:53.917,00:03:58.041,But I wish I was big enough to pick a cherry myself.
00:03:53.917,00:04:00.041,- You know what I learned when I was a little prince?
00:04:12.125,00:04:17.166,- But...what am I big enough to do?

00:07:48.834,00:07:52.583,There's something shiny under these tree roots.
00:07:52.625,00:07:57.375,It's... It's...
00:07:57.417,00:08:00.375,- It must have fallen off the tree!

00:08:04.125,00:08:08.709,- You are too big to get the golden pear?
00:08:08.750,00:08:13.250,"Prince Wednesday, ahem, do you think your hand can fit?"

00:15:31.333,00:15:34.417,- Another grown-up tool?
00:15:34.458,00:15:38.750,Does that mean I can't be your helper tiger anymore?

00:17:04.667,00:17:12.291,"- You are a helper tiger! Now, will you hold the door open while I put on the handle?"
00:17:28.291,00:17:32.709,- I see it!
00:17:32.750,00:17:38.333,"- Hmm, my hand is too big to reach under there!"

00:02:44.625,00:02:51.375,You can pick one and put it on and come have some breakfast.
00:02:51.417,00:02:54.542,I have to get dressed now and not play.
00:02:54.583,00:02:56.834,"Hmm, which sweater should I wear?"

00:05:53.709,00:05:57.166,"- So, we gently squeeze the toothpaste on."
00:05:57.208,00:05:59.625,- Is it my extra bubbly toothpaste?
00:05:59.667,00:06:03.291,- It sure is. See this timer?
00:06:03.333,00:06:05.667,- It will ding when you can stop brushing. OK?
00:06:05.709,00:06:07.542,- OK.
00:06:07.583,00:06:10.041,"Look, a bubble!"

00:02:55.583,00:02:57.834,I hope you're thirsty!
00:02:57.875,00:03:01.750,"Some water for you, big grown sunflowers!"
00:03:01.792,00:03:04.709,- I couldn't find that spray bottle anywhere!
00:03:04.750,00:03:09.875,"- So, Mom, notice anything..."
00:03:09.917,00:03:13.208,- Hm! Different?
00:03:13.250,00:03:15.667,- Are you suuuure?
00:03:15.709,00:03:18.709,You don't notice anything about these sunflowers?
00:03:18.750,00:03:21.291,"- These sunflowers, huh?"
00:03:21.333,00:03:25.417,- See what I did for you?!
00:03:25.458,00:03:28.917,- What?
00:03:25.458,00:03:32.208,- It looks like my sunflowers were... watered.
00:03:32.250,00:03:35.250,- Did you water my sunflowers for me?
00:03:35.291,00:03:39.125,- I did! I did!
00:03:39.166,00:03:43.208,"- Well...you're my mom, and my neighbour, so I wanted to..."
00:03:46.333,00:03:50.667,...like water your flowers.
00:03:50.709,00:03:56.583,"You know, it does feel good in here, when you do something kind."
00:03:56.625,00:03:59.458,- It's true.
00:04:05.000,00:04:06.959,- What do you want to do?
00:04:07.000,00:04:08.542,- Hmm...
00:04:08.583,00:04:13.125,"Umm... well, sunflowers make you really happy, right, Mom?"
00:04:13.166,00:04:16.083,- They sure do.
00:04:13.166,00:04:18.542,- So... maybe sunflowers would make our neighbours happy too!
00:04:24.166,00:04:31.834,Would it be OK if I gave your sunflowers to our neighbours?
00:04:28.000,00:04:34.041,"- Yes, you are a very thoughtful little tiger. Ugga-mugga!"
00:04:34.083,00:04:36.208,That's a lovely idea.
00:04:36.250,00:04:38.709,"Here, we can take these."
00:04:38.750,00:04:42.583,Giving sunflowers to all the neighbours is a big job!
00:04:42.625,00:04:44.792,"You'll help me, right?"
00:04:44.834,00:04:46.959,Let's go!

00:05:07.250,00:05:12.458,- Yes! We can do lots and lots of neighbourly things for our neighbours!
00:05:12.500,00:05:14.750,I'm glad you're helping too!
00:05:17.458,00:05:19.792,"Trolley, I see my friends!"

00:16:46.000,00:16:49.333,From Music Man Stan.
00:16:51.333,00:16:54.625,I told him that a kazoo was my favourite instrument.
00:16:54.667,00:16:56.625,And he remembered.
00:16:56.667,00:16:58.834,- He's a good neighbour.
00:16:58.875,00:17:01.375,"- Oh! What are you making, Baker Aker?"

00:18:12.125,00:18:15.583,But cleaning up is not my favourite.
00:18:15.625,00:18:18.083,I have to put everything back on the shelves.
00:18:18.125,00:18:22.125,I'd better box up these cupcakes for King Friday! Be right back!
00:18:28.041,00:18:31.333,I think I know a way we can help Baker Aker...
00:18:33.333,00:18:41.041,"I think it would be so nice to help him clean up the bakery, don't you think?"
00:18:41.083,00:18:43.125,- Yes!
00:18:50.041,00:18:54.000,- Mom! What if we cleaned up for Baker Aker?
00:18:54.041,00:18:56.583,- That would be a very neighbourly thing to do.
00:18:58.208,00:19:00.542,"Pass the flour, please."
00:19:00.583,00:19:03.583,- Got it! Here you go!

00:19:06.458,00:19:09.166,Where do you think the flour should go?
00:19:11.834,00:19:14.250,I see the flour up there!
00:19:14.291,00:19:16.500,Flour... check!
00:19:19.000,00:19:21.750,- Hmmm...where do the sprinkles go?
00:19:24.875,00:19:28.250,Oh! The rainbow sprinkles go over there!
00:19:29.875,00:19:31.834,Sprinkles... check!
00:19:31.875,00:19:37.250,"- And if you can be on towel duty, I will take care of these things."

00:20:10.417,00:20:12.208,- Did I hear the bell?
00:20:12.250,00:20:14.375,My kitchen! It's... it's...
00:20:14.417,00:20:16.750,so clean and...

00:22:31.125,00:22:35.000,And one little Daniel tiger started it all...
00:22:35.041,00:22:37.000,and it spread throughout the neighbourhood!
00:22:39.291,00:22:41.750,- Me? I started it?
00:22:41.792,00:22:45.625,"- Yes, you helped me deliver my packages. Remember?"

00:22:56.875,00:23:01.291,"- And when you brought me my kazoo, you helped me clean up my bakery."
00:23:01.333,00:23:04.792,So I could make these for everyone!
00:23:04.834,00:23:07.083,"- Well look at that, Daniel."
00:23:12.166,00:23:14.458,When you do something nice for your neighbour.

00:04:20.417,00:04:27.542,"- Well, yes, I do have to go to the potty, but I don't want to go right now. I'm still playing!"
00:04:27.583,00:04:29.750,- I know it's hard to stop playing.
00:04:38.000,00:04:44.750,"- I know you want to stay and play, but it's important to stop, and go to the bathroom right away."
00:04:44.792,00:04:47.750,- Because I don't want you to have a potty accident.
00:04:52.417,00:05:00.166,- Well... this sign will let everyone know to stop playing with these blocks while you're gone.

00:15:07.792,00:15:09.375,Uh-oh.
00:15:09.417,00:15:11.583,I have to go potty again.
00:15:11.625,00:15:15.166,I hope I can hold it until we get home.
00:15:22.208,00:15:23.792,Yeahhhh.
00:15:23.834,00:15:26.583,- I'm a trombone tiger too!
00:15:28.208,00:15:31.208,Yeah! Uh-oh!
00:15:34.417,00:15:37.417,"- Daniel, do you have to go to the bathroom?"
00:15:40.834,00:15:42.417,- You can go now.
00:15:54.542,00:15:56.125,- OK.
00:15:56.166,00:16:00.375,"- Say, Music Man Stan, do you have a bathroom here at the Music Shop?"
00:16:00.417,00:16:02.375,- I absolutely do.
00:16:10.041,00:16:11.750,- Really?
00:16:13.417,00:16:15.375,- OK.
00:16:15.417,00:16:17.166,"- Come on, we'll go together."
00:16:21.041,00:16:24.542,Here we are. I'll be right outside the door.
00:16:24.583,00:16:26.750,Roar if you need me.
00:16:31.834,00:16:34.417,I'm sitting on the potty.
00:16:34.458,00:16:39.166,"Ha! Ha! Sitting on the potty, sitting on the potty."
00:16:39.208,00:16:41.417,Ah.
00:16:41.458,00:16:44.792,What can I do while I sit on the potty?
00:16:44.834,00:16:48.792,"Hey, I have an idea!"
00:16:52.875,00:16:54.250,Ha! Ha!
00:17:32.667,00:17:35.959,"in there, my favourite fuzzy tiger?"
00:17:36.000,00:17:38.834,- Good! I'm almost done!
00:17:47.375,00:17:49.375,"Wash, wash, wash."
00:17:53.208,00:17:55.208,Dry.
00:17:57.625,00:17:59.208,All done!
00:17:59.250,00:18:02.792,"- Nice job, my big and strong tiger!"
00:18:08.417,00:18:10.583,- Sounds good to me!
00:18:14.583,00:18:16.583,- Did you find the bathroom OK?
00:18:16.625,00:18:18.583,- I did!
00:18:24.625,00:18:31.375,"Dr. Anna's office has a bathroom, the neighbourhood café has a bathroom, the grocery store has a bathroom."
00:18:34.917,00:18:37.208,Now I have to go to the bathroom too.
00:18:45.000,00:18:47.333,- Back in a flash!
00:18:47.375,00:18:55.500,"- When Music Man Stan has to go to the potty, he stops what he's doing, just like me!"
00:19:01.500,00:19:58.000,no matter where you are to potty and you start - Your trumpet is all fixed!
00:20:04.208,00:20:06.375,- Outta sight!
00:20:06.417,00:20:08.542,"- Oh, thank you, Music Man Stan!"
00:20:08.583,00:20:10.417,- Of course.
00:20:10.458,00:20:16.792,"Come back any time, tigers, to play my instruments-- or use the bathroom."
00:20:16.834,00:20:19.208,"- Thanks, Music Man Stan!"
00:20:19.250,00:20:21.959,"- Bye, Music Man Stan."
00:20:28.041,00:20:29.750,"- Please take us home, Trolley."
00:20:43.625,00:20:47.583,"- Yeah! You're a grr-ific trumpet player, Dad."
00:20:49.250,00:20:52.166,"- Thanks for coming with me to the Music Shop, Daniel."
00:20:57.917,00:20:59.500,"- Thanks, Trolley."
00:20:59.542,00:21:03.208,"- Bye, Trolley!"
00:21:03.250,00:21:08.000,"Hmm, did you know that there are bathrooms in lots of places?"
00:21:12.417,00:21:14.542,Thanks for coming with me today.
00:21:18.291,00:21:30.959,to play with family - Hi!
00:00:51.792,00:00:54.792,Hi neighbour!
00:00:57.208,00:00:58.667,STOP!
00:01:00.542,00:01:02.083,STOP!
00:01:02.125,00:01:04.875,I'm pretending to be a crossing guard...
00:01:04.917,00:01:07.208,I'm helping people know when to STOP...
00:01:12.000,00:01:14.208,Then let's....
00:01:14.250,00:01:15.500,"Hi, Teacher Harriet!"
00:01:15.542,00:01:16.834,I'm a crossing guard.
00:01:19.000,00:01:20.125,"Hello, neighbour."
00:01:20.166,00:01:22.250,I need to cross the street.
00:01:22.291,00:01:23.458,May I cross?
00:01:23.500,00:01:25.291,You may!
00:01:25.333,00:01:26.500,Thanks Daniel.
00:01:26.542,00:01:28.458,"Officer O, coming through!"
00:01:28.500,00:01:30.208,"STOP, Officer O!"
00:01:32.250,00:01:33.750,Okay...I stopped...
00:01:33.792,00:01:35.166,Can I go now?
00:01:35.208,00:01:36.291,Go!
00:01:44.375,00:01:49.333,"Excuse me, Mr. Firefighter, but I have an important meow meow, mail delivery!"
00:01:49.375,00:01:50.959,Here's a letter for you.
00:01:53.583,00:01:57.208,It says...I have to go fight fires!
00:01:57.250,00:01:58.333,Pshh!
00:01:58.375,00:02:00.208,Coming through toots!
00:02:01.750,00:02:03.709,"Daniel, remember our rule!"
00:02:03.750,00:02:10.291,"When someone is swinging stay behind the line, so you don't get kicked by accident."
00:02:10.333,00:02:11.583,Okay.
00:02:15.959,00:02:17.166,Dance?
00:02:17.208,00:02:21.083,I'm a mail kitty...
00:02:21.125,00:02:22.667,I need to go!
00:02:22.709,00:02:25.041,Stop!
00:02:29.208,00:02:32.417,"When the sign is green, you go!"
00:02:32.458,00:02:33.583,GO!
00:02:35.709,00:02:38.291,Stop!
00:02:38.333,00:02:41.250,Stop!
00:02:41.291,00:02:42.792,Stop!
00:02:42.834,00:02:44.000,Whoa!
00:02:44.041,00:02:47.667,Move back from the swing so you don't get hurt.
00:02:57.792,00:02:59.709,Okay.
00:02:59.750,00:03:01.500,"Children, gather around."
00:03:04.000,00:03:05.625,Hoo! Hoo!
00:03:09.166,00:03:11.417,and he's somebody's brother...
00:03:11.458,00:03:13.750,Well I don't have a brother so...
00:03:13.792,00:03:15.709,I have a brother!
00:03:21.583,00:03:23.834,A royal hello to you all!
00:03:30.208,00:03:33.333,I'm going to take you on a safety walk through our neighbourhood!
00:03:35.625,00:03:37.875,we're supposed to be in school!
00:03:39.375,00:03:44.875,"It's okay O, this is an important field trip to learn about rules!"
00:03:44.917,00:03:46.125,Right!
00:03:49.041,00:03:50.542,"Hoo, rules in the neighbourhood."
00:03:50.583,00:03:52.333,I like the sound of that!
00:03:52.375,00:03:53.583,I love rules!
00:03:55.000,00:04:11.917,"Okay, the most important safety rule of walking around the neighbourhood is, you need to - Right, stop when I say 'stop'..."
00:04:13.709,00:04:15.000,"Excellent, everyone."
00:04:16.417,00:04:20.542,"no running on the sidewalk, or you might fall and get hurt."
00:04:22.208,00:04:23.417,Good.
00:04:23.458,00:04:26.458,And the last rule is...
00:04:26.500,00:04:28.667,Whoa Daniel...
00:04:26.500,00:04:31.000,we're really going to be in the neighbourhood during school!
00:04:31.041,00:04:32.750,What a day!
00:04:32.792,00:04:35.083,I know!
00:04:35.125,00:04:37.625,"Hoo hoo, okay!"
00:04:37.667,00:04:40.000,"Okay, I see that everyone has a buddy..."
00:04:40.041,00:04:41.333,Including me!
00:04:41.375,00:04:43.083,So let's walk!
00:04:43.125,00:04:46.208,And be on the lookout for a...stop sign!
00:04:46.250,00:04:48.000,DANIEL: My favourite!
00:04:48.041,00:04:51.667,"You look for a stop sign too, okay?"
00:05:03.834,00:05:05.750,"Look, I see the stop sign!"
00:05:05.792,00:05:07.333,"Good finding, little D!"
00:05:07.375,00:05:09.125,A stop sign means...
00:05:09.166,00:05:10.375,Stop!
00:05:10.417,00:05:14.125,"Yes, that's telling everyone to stop and so we will too."
00:05:14.166,00:05:17.667,"Stop, look both ways, and then you can..."
00:05:18.917,00:05:23.667,"We're going to go across the street, so everyone hold hands..."
00:05:28.250,00:05:30.000,Is anything coming?
00:05:32.125,00:05:33.542,ALL: No...
00:05:33.583,00:05:35.625,That means it is safe to cross.
00:05:35.667,00:05:37.125,Okay then...
00:05:40.750,00:05:42.709,"Nice job, everyone!"
00:05:42.750,00:05:46.250,"I guess it's time to head back to school now, right, Teacher Harriet?"
00:05:46.291,00:05:47.959,"Not quite, O."
00:05:48.000,00:05:50.834,We still have more rules to learn.
00:05:50.875,00:05:54.417,There are lots of rules to keep us safe in the neighbourhood.
00:05:54.458,00:05:55.750,More rules?
00:05:55.792,00:05:58.375,Hoo hoo!
00:06:16.750,00:06:18.750,I see the traffic light!
00:06:20.458,00:06:23.583,Traffic lights tell everyone when to stop and when to go.
00:06:25.000,00:06:27.250,Right.
00:06:27.291,00:06:30.542,Trolleys and people must follow the safety signs.
00:06:30.583,00:06:32.375,Hi Trolley!
00:06:37.542,00:06:41.709,Hey... do you want to make-believe with me?
00:06:41.750,00:06:48.250,Let's make believe that all of the things that keep us safe can sing to us!
00:07:22.542,00:07:25.417,Wasn't that Grr-ific?
00:07:30.709,00:07:32.041,All clear!
00:07:34.625,00:07:36.667,I see a safety sign!
00:07:38.041,00:07:40.083,"Prince Wednesday, no running on the sidewalk!"
00:07:40.125,00:07:41.250,It's - whoa!
00:07:41.291,00:07:42.583,Ow.
00:07:42.625,00:07:44.667,Prince Wednesday fell down!
00:07:44.709,00:07:46.542,"Prince Wednesday, are you all right?"
00:07:47.917,00:07:51.667,"I know that you were excited, but you have to follow the rules too."
00:07:51.709,00:07:53.208,They're here to keep you safe.
00:08:01.875,00:08:03.458,I'm sorry I didn't stop and listen.
00:08:03.500,00:08:05.208,I'm glad you're okay.
00:08:05.250,00:08:06.458,Thanks.
00:08:06.500,00:08:08.458,"Come on, let's go join the group."
00:08:13.083,00:08:14.959,Does anyone know what it is?
00:08:15.000,00:08:17.500,"It's a walk, don't walk sign."
00:08:17.542,00:08:19.917,That red hand means don't walk.
00:08:25.542,00:08:28.625,"That person means we can walk, hoo hoo!"
00:08:30.375,00:08:32.709,Owls are excellent at keeping people safe.
00:08:32.750,00:08:33.875,Hoo hoo!
00:08:33.917,00:08:37.875,"Let's hold hands, look both ways, and safely cross the street!"
00:08:37.917,00:08:39.083,"Hold my hand, O."
00:08:39.125,00:08:41.375,And look both ways.
00:08:41.417,00:08:43.709,"Left, right, good!"
00:08:43.750,00:08:45.959,We can safely cross the street.
00:08:49.041,00:08:50.750,We made it!
00:10:00.834,00:10:03.500,"Great job on our safety walk, everyone!"
00:10:03.542,00:10:04.875,"How do you feel, O?"
00:10:04.917,00:10:09.083,Doesn't it feel good to know you can stop and listen to stay safe?
00:10:09.125,00:10:11.125,I feel good!
00:10:11.166,00:10:13.000,I know how to keep us safe!
00:10:13.041,00:10:14.291,Oh good.
00:10:14.333,00:10:16.792,And now...
00:10:16.834,00:10:18.792,the Red Light Green Light game!
00:10:18.834,00:10:20.750,I love that game!
00:10:20.792,00:10:22.041,How do you play?
00:10:22.083,00:10:25.166,When I say red light you... freeze!
00:10:25.208,00:10:27.417,When I say green light you go!
00:10:27.458,00:10:29.500,So...let's play!
00:10:29.542,00:10:32.000,"You play too, okay?"
00:10:35.291,00:10:36.875,Red Light!
00:10:36.917,00:10:38.250,And...
00:10:40.667,00:10:42.250,Red light!
00:10:42.291,00:10:43.875,Red light!
00:10:43.917,00:10:45.959,I had so much fun today.
00:10:46.000,00:10:48.583,What was your favourite part of our walk?
00:10:50.500,00:10:54.291,I liked seeing the stop sign the best.
00:10:54.333,00:10:57.125,Now I know how to be safe in my neighbourhood!
00:10:57.166,00:10:59.250,I can't wait to play again soon.
00:11:13.667,00:11:16.083,Meow meow me!
00:11:16.125,00:11:18.583,Today...
00:11:21.583,00:11:23.083,Come on!
00:11:23.125,00:11:25.333,Hello there everyone.
00:11:25.375,00:11:26.667,Mmm....
00:11:26.709,00:11:29.166,It's such a beautiful day in the neighbourhood.
00:11:29.208,00:11:31.000,Ready to play on Jungle Beach?
00:11:34.750,00:11:36.166,And...
00:11:37.875,00:11:39.583,Let's go!
00:11:45.375,00:11:48.709,"Katerina, Daniel, you remember our first safety rule, right?"
00:11:48.750,00:11:49.917,Mm-hmm.
00:11:49.959,00:11:55.959,"To stay safe, you have to stop what you are doing when I say stop."
00:11:56.000,00:12:00.208,And listen to what I say if I call for you.
00:12:08.709,00:12:12.333,"Now...tell me you two, what are you going to do on the beach today?"
00:12:12.375,00:12:14.709,We want to look for a...
00:12:14.750,00:12:16.417,Starfish!
00:12:16.458,00:12:17.333,Like the one in my book.
00:12:17.375,00:12:18.667,See?
00:12:18.709,00:12:21.750,It looks just like a real star...
00:12:27.000,00:12:32.834,"Don't go in the water without me, and make sure you can always see me, got it?"
00:12:32.875,00:12:34.041,Got it.
00:12:34.083,00:12:35.083,Okay good.
00:12:37.333,00:12:38.834,I'll be watching.
00:12:38.875,00:12:40.333,Grr-iffic!
00:12:40.375,00:12:42.709,"Meow meow, Daniel, where should we look first?"
00:12:44.792,00:12:46.291,Maybe this way?
00:12:48.250,00:12:50.667,"Tell me if you see a starfish, okay?"
00:12:50.709,00:12:53.250,Oh Starfish...
00:12:55.625,00:12:57.417,Starfish...
00:12:57.458,00:13:00.375,Meow meow Daniel - I see something....
00:13:00.417,00:13:01.625,it's...treasure!
00:13:01.667,00:13:02.875,A shell treasure!
00:13:02.917,00:13:04.500,Hey...
00:13:06.542,00:13:07.917,like me!
00:13:07.959,00:13:09.500,See?
00:13:12.667,00:13:13.875,It is!
00:13:13.917,00:13:15.291,Let's put it in here.
00:13:15.333,00:13:17.417,In my...
00:13:17.458,00:13:18.625,There.
00:13:18.667,00:13:20.000,Ooh...
00:13:20.041,00:13:23.875,Let's see if we can find a starfish over there!
00:13:23.917,00:13:25.458,Come on!
00:13:33.792,00:13:36.625,"Nice job stopping, are you ready to listen?"
00:13:38.041,00:13:39.792,Good!
00:13:39.834,00:13:41.917,It looked like you were running a little too far down the beach.
00:13:41.959,00:13:44.709,If you'd like to go for a walk I'll go with you.
00:13:44.750,00:13:46.500,Grr-yes!
00:13:46.542,00:13:48.083,Great!
00:13:48.125,00:13:51.875,Maybe a starfish is...
00:13:51.917,00:13:54.667,Maybe it's hiding under the sand...
00:13:54.709,00:13:57.333,Yeah...
00:13:57.375,00:13:59.125,Is it a starfish?
00:13:59.166,00:14:00.667,something else...
00:14:00.709,00:14:03.041,buried treasure?
00:14:05.375,00:14:07.333,We have to dig for it!
00:14:07.375,00:14:08.917,It looks big meow meow...
00:14:08.959,00:14:12.083,Let's dig some more...
00:14:17.083,00:14:18.667,Look at all the bumps and twists...
00:14:18.709,00:14:21.041,And it's...
00:14:21.083,00:14:24.000,I think I've seen this kind of shell before...
00:14:27.250,00:14:30.125,"Oh yeah, meow meow, if we listen to it..."
00:14:39.458,00:14:41.250,I hear it too!
00:14:41.291,00:14:44.166,Listen...can you hear the ocean?
00:14:57.333,00:14:58.875,Okay!
00:14:58.917,00:15:00.250,"Here we go, Daniel!"
00:15:02.709,00:15:04.083,"What is it Daniel, meow meow?"
00:15:04.125,00:15:05.917,Remember what my mom said?
00:15:05.959,00:15:09.542,"If we want to go in the water, she needs to go with us!"
00:15:09.583,00:15:11.500,Oh yes.
00:15:11.542,00:15:12.917,Mom!
00:15:12.959,00:15:14.750,"I'm right here Daniel, what's up?"
00:15:16.583,00:15:18.375,and we want to clean them in the water!
00:15:18.417,00:15:19.834,Will you come with us?
00:15:19.875,00:15:21.083,Absolutely.
00:15:21.125,00:15:23.208,Good job remembering our rule.
00:15:28.166,00:15:29.667,Here come the shells...
00:15:29.709,00:15:31.125,Cha cha cha!
00:15:33.542,00:15:35.375,They're all clean!
00:15:38.417,00:15:39.709,"Guess what, Mom!"
00:15:39.750,00:15:41.709,Did you know you can hear the ocean in this shell?
00:15:41.750,00:15:43.875,You can?
00:15:43.917,00:15:45.583,Mm-hmm...
00:15:47.500,00:15:49.250,hearing the ocean?
00:15:49.291,00:15:51.750,The shell is telling me something...
00:15:51.792,00:15:52.750,What?
00:15:52.792,00:15:58.250,"The shell said that little animals sometimes live inside, right here..."
00:16:03.000,00:16:06.000,An animal's home?
00:16:10.875,00:16:12.500,Let's make believe...
00:16:12.542,00:16:14.792,that we can go inside a shell!
00:16:53.834,00:16:55.959,I think I'd like living in a shell!
00:16:58.458,00:16:59.959,Now is it a starfish?
00:17:00.000,00:17:01.041,No!
00:17:01.083,00:17:02.750,Something else...
00:17:02.792,00:17:03.834,Come on!
00:17:05.000,00:17:06.417,"Oh, look..."
00:17:06.458,00:17:08.542,Legs!
00:17:09.917,00:17:11.250,"It's moving, meow meow!"
00:17:12.500,00:17:14.458,"Meow, meow, he's walking away."
00:17:14.500,00:17:17.125,I think you found a little crab!
00:17:19.000,00:17:21.208,Let's walk like the crab!
00:17:21.250,00:17:23.709,"You can walk like a crab too, if you want..."
00:17:23.750,00:17:26.125,Crab walk...
00:17:28.291,00:17:30.417,It's going sideways!
00:17:32.750,00:17:34.667,Wow!
00:17:34.709,00:17:39.250,"Now, it's going slow..."
00:17:41.917,00:17:42.959,"And now really, really fast!"
00:17:46.083,00:17:47.583,"It walks funny, meow meow!"
00:17:47.625,00:17:49.500,That crab was fast!
00:17:49.542,00:17:50.625,"Mom, look!"
00:17:50.667,00:17:52.250,Did you see the silly crab?
00:17:56.834,00:17:57.625,I can't see my mom.
00:17:57.667,00:17:59.125,Maybe we should...
00:18:06.625,00:18:07.834,Mom?
00:18:09.208,00:18:10.208,I'm right here!
00:18:12.542,00:18:13.750,But then we stopped...
00:18:13.792,00:18:15.542,and we listened to see if we could hear you!
00:18:15.583,00:18:17.333,And now we can see you.
00:18:18.500,00:18:20.000,Nice job.
00:18:20.041,00:18:22.750,"I could still see you, but I'm glad you came closer."
00:18:22.792,00:18:24.917,You remembered our safety rule!
00:18:34.875,00:18:36.917,We still haven't found a starfish!
00:18:36.959,00:18:39.208,We just have to find one!
00:18:41.250,00:18:43.625,"Keep looking with us, okay?"
00:18:43.667,00:18:45.417,I know we'll find one!
00:18:45.458,00:18:46.542,Come on!
00:18:50.625,00:18:52.083,BOTH: It is!
00:18:52.125,00:18:53.959,A starfish!
00:18:54.000,00:18:55.542,"There's a starfish, meow meow!"
00:18:55.583,00:18:58.417,Starfish!
00:19:11.917,00:19:13.500,"Sorry, Mom..."
00:19:13.542,00:19:16.583,I just got excited by the starfish.
00:19:16.625,00:19:20.542,I understand but the rules are here to keep you safe.
00:19:20.583,00:19:23.333,"So, now..."
00:19:23.375,00:19:26.542,let's go to the water and have some fun together!
00:19:29.709,00:19:31.750,here we come!
00:19:31.792,00:19:32.875,Oh meow meow...
00:20:41.208,00:20:42.625,Jump!
00:20:42.667,00:20:46.083,"Daniel, let's make a sand castle with our shell treasures!"
00:20:46.125,00:20:47.333,Okay!
00:20:50.333,00:20:54.291,"Jungle Beach, cha cha cha Meow, meow..."
00:20:54.333,00:20:57.667,we can put the big pink bumpy shell on top.
00:20:57.709,00:21:00.083,And the tiger striped one here for a door.
00:21:00.125,00:21:02.041,There.
00:21:02.083,00:21:04.667,Good job!
00:21:10.333,00:21:12.625,I'm glad you came to the beach with us today.
00:21:12.667,00:21:13.959,And stayed safe.
00:21:14.000,00:21:15.750,Ugga Mugga.
00:01:00.583,00:01:03.166,- Wow!
00:01:03.208,00:01:06.583,Wee! Ha! Ha!
00:01:06.625,00:01:10.375,"Hi, neighbour!"
00:01:10.417,00:01:20.542,"On Snowflake Day, we go to the Enchanted Garden, and there's snowflake music, and snowflake food, and we put on a snowflake show!"
00:01:20.583,00:01:22.458,And you can come too!
00:01:22.500,00:01:26.208,Wait till you see what I'm gonna be in the show.
00:01:26.250,00:01:29.125,Look! It's snowing!
00:01:29.166,00:01:31.750,- Happy Snowflake Day!
00:01:33.917,00:01:38.542,- Happy Snowflake Day to you!
00:01:38.583,00:01:40.417,"- Mm, mmm!"
00:01:40.458,00:01:44.959,- Look at that. It's snowing on Snowflake Day. Grr-ific!
00:01:47.583,00:01:52.125,"Like... this snowflake, and this snowflake."
00:01:57.583,00:02:02.500,- Yeah. But they all just look like little dots to me.
00:02:02.542,00:02:09.750,"- Yes, but if you could look really close, you'd see that each one is different."
00:02:09.792,00:02:13.792,- I'm looking sooooo close.
00:02:13.834,00:02:17.917,"Hmm, this one looks like..."
00:02:17.959,00:02:21.500,This one looks like a little flower.
00:02:32.792,00:02:36.208,- Ready to get going?
00:02:36.250,00:02:38.667,- Come with us!
00:03:15.125,00:03:59.333,"twinkling, the snow is covered, the snow is - We have to press the 3 red roses to open the door to the Enchanted Garden."
00:03:59.375,00:04:01.208,Count with me!
00:04:01.250,00:04:04.500,One... two... three.
00:04:06.500,00:04:07.875,Wow.
00:04:10.125,00:04:12.667,Come on!
00:04:12.709,00:04:15.041,Isn't it twinkly?
00:04:15.083,00:04:18.834,I love all the lights.
00:04:18.875,00:04:20.959,See the snowflakes?
00:04:21.000,00:04:22.959,We made those in school.
00:04:23.000,00:04:25.667,And the lanterns?
00:04:29.333,00:04:31.208,See the stage?
00:04:31.250,00:04:34.417,This is where we put on the Snowflake Day Show!
00:04:38.834,00:04:41.458,"- Oh, I'm going to see if King Friday needs any help."
00:04:48.166,00:04:50.667,I'll give you some hints.
00:04:53.250,00:04:56.583,It's something white.
00:05:01.625,00:05:05.959,And every single one is different. Can you guess?
00:05:11.542,00:05:14.417,Ta-da! I'm a snowflake!
00:05:14.458,00:05:19.000,Do you like my snowflake costume?
00:05:22.041,00:05:26.583,"- I am a snowflake, as special as can be."
00:05:36.917,00:05:40.291,"- Oooh, that's my snowflake!"
00:05:40.333,00:05:44.000,- Being the snowflake in the show is a big job.
00:05:47.166,00:05:50.875,- I know you do. And I'm proud of you for practicing so hard.
00:05:50.917,00:05:52.709,"- Thanks, Mom."
00:05:58.417,00:06:00.959,Will you practice with me?
00:06:01.000,00:06:03.792,Here goes.
00:06:07.500,00:06:11.875,There is nobody else exactly like me.
00:06:11.917,00:06:15.375,"I'm here to say, let's start the play."
00:06:17.625,00:06:19.583,"- Happy Snowflake Day, Daniel, meow-meow."
00:06:19.625,00:06:21.375,- Happy Snowflake Day!
00:06:28.125,00:06:30.375,"- Do you have my fairy costume, meow-meow?"
00:06:30.417,00:06:33.583,- I certainly do.
00:06:33.625,00:06:37.583,- Poof! Your fairy costume!
00:06:37.625,00:06:39.875,"- Meow-meow, thank you!"
00:06:39.917,00:06:43.041,"I just love, love, love, love, love it!"
00:06:53.917,00:06:58.041,"- Daniel, meow-meow, I want to show you what my mom made for the show."
00:06:58.083,00:07:02.083,- Your mom made something for the show too? Tiger-tastic!
00:07:05.333,00:07:10.375,And do you know what I like to do when I work?
00:07:22.041,00:07:23.750,- Let's go see what your mom made.
00:07:36.375,00:07:39.917,- Look! I helped my mommy paint this bed.
00:07:39.959,00:07:43.583,It's the scenery - so the stage looks like a bedroom.
00:07:43.625,00:07:46.250,- It DOES look like a bedroom.
00:07:46.291,00:07:49.250,"- Would you like to help us put it on stage, meow-meow?"
00:07:51.125,00:07:54.542,- And do you know what I like to do when I'm moving scenery?
00:07:54.583,00:07:56.333,- Sing!
00:08:10.417,00:08:12.291,"All done, meow-meow!"
00:08:14.208,00:08:16.834,I wonder what everyone else is doing to help the show.
00:08:16.875,00:08:19.375,Let's go see!
00:08:19.417,00:08:21.625,I can't wait for the show to start!
00:08:21.667,00:08:24.083,And I'm glad you're here to see it.
00:08:24.125,00:08:26.333,"Happy Snowflake Day, Owls!"
00:08:26.375,00:08:29.166,"- Very happy Snowflake Day, Snowflake Daniel!"
00:08:29.208,00:08:30.792,- Happy Snowflake Day!
00:08:35.041,00:08:41.834,"- My snowflake book says every single snowflake is different and special, hoo-hoo. See?"
00:08:41.875,00:08:45.208,- I see.
00:08:45.250,00:08:48.417,Just like we are all special.
00:08:48.458,00:08:52.125,"- You both are special, hoo-hoo."
00:08:52.166,00:08:55.041,Would you like to see the refreshments we're making for the show?
00:08:55.083,00:08:58.166,- Refreshments is a fancy word for food.
00:09:00.000,00:09:01.583,Can I help?
00:09:01.625,00:09:05.208,"- You can help us make popcorn snowflakes, hoo-hoo."
00:09:10.166,00:09:12.083,- Sing!
00:09:29.792,00:09:31.709,That's a fancy word for food.
00:09:31.750,00:09:33.792,"- Ooh, strawberries!"
00:09:33.834,00:09:36.375,"- It's not time to eat yet, hoo-hoo!"
00:09:36.417,00:09:41.542,"- Sorry! I was practicing for the show, and it made me huuuuungry!"
00:09:43.208,00:09:45.542,- What's your family doing for the show?
00:09:45.583,00:09:48.458,- My mom and dad are playing music. Want to come listen?
00:09:48.500,00:09:50.375,- OK!
00:09:50.417,00:09:52.834,- I... have to go get my costume on!

00:10:06.917,00:10:08.750,Keep it up!
00:10:08.792,00:10:13.166,"And when I'm playing music, you know what I like to do?"
00:10:15.208,00:10:18.959,- You bet your snowflake I do!
00:10:34.792,00:10:39.792,- That's a fancy word for food.
00:10:43.250,00:10:45.917,"- Jingle, jingle!"
00:10:45.959,00:10:48.125,"- Jingle, jingle, jingle!"
00:10:48.166,00:10:50.291,"- Jingle, jingle, jingle!"
00:10:50.333,00:10:53.583,"Happy Snowflake Day, Prince Wednesday!"
00:10:53.625,00:10:57.792,"- Happy Snowflake Day, Chrissie!"
00:10:57.834,00:11:00.125,- Uh-huh! I came for Snowflake Day.
00:11:00.166,00:11:04.375,I wouldn't miss it.
00:11:04.417,00:11:06.000,- I know!
00:11:06.041,00:11:09.417,Want to hear my line?
00:11:18.166,00:11:23.333,There is nobody else exactly like me.
00:11:27.875,00:11:31.375,- Good!
00:11:31.417,00:11:34.709,"- So... is it time to start the show, or what?!"
00:11:38.750,00:11:41.709,It is time to start the show!
00:11:41.750,00:11:44.000,- Yeah!
00:11:44.041,00:11:46.625,"- I have to go get on my costume, toots."
00:11:46.667,00:11:50.083,- And I have to...
00:11:50.125,00:11:52.542,- I have to show everyone where to sit.
00:11:52.583,00:11:55.166,- And I have to...
00:11:57.834,00:11:59.959,Boop-she boop-she boooooop!

00:12:06.917,00:12:09.417,- The show is about to start!
00:12:09.458,00:12:14.041,And you know what I like to do when the show is about to start?
00:12:14.083,00:12:17.083,Sing! You can sing along!
00:12:32.667,00:12:35.667,That's a fancy word for food!
00:12:45.959,00:12:50.583,"- Places! Places, everyone!"
00:12:53.625,00:12:56.166,- That's the fancy word for begin.
00:12:56.208,00:12:59.583,- It's time to do the show!
00:12:59.625,00:13:02.125,Will you come behind the curtain with me?
00:13:02.166,00:13:04.125,Let's go.
00:13:10.250,00:13:14.417,Will you help me practice my line one more time?
00:13:14.458,00:13:21.542,"I am a snowflake, as special as can be."
00:13:21.583,00:13:27.917,There is nobody else exactly like me.
00:13:27.959,00:13:32.583,"I'm here to say, let's start the play."
00:13:32.625,00:13:36.542,"- Psst! Daniel, you have to say your line to start the show."
00:13:36.583,00:13:38.166,- OK.
00:13:38.208,00:13:40.500,Here it goes.
00:13:45.792,00:13:48.834,I... I...
00:13:48.875,00:13:51.250,I...
00:13:51.291,00:13:52.875,Ah!
00:13:52.917,00:13:56.083,"Mom, I don't want to be the snowflake anymore."
00:13:56.125,00:13:58.166,- You don't? Why not?
00:13:58.208,00:14:01.917,- Everyone is...
00:14:01.959,00:14:03.959,Do I have to be the snowflake?
00:14:04.000,00:14:09.041,"- No, you don't have to, but I know you can do it if you try."
00:14:09.083,00:14:11.959,- I don't know if I can do it by myself.
00:14:12.000,00:14:16.583,"- You're not by yourself, Daniel, meow-meow; I'll be here cheering for you."
00:14:18.834,00:14:20.792,"- Yeah, me too, hoo-hoo."
00:14:24.041,00:14:26.166,All of your friends are here to help you.
00:14:44.000,00:14:46.750,"OK, I'm ready now."
00:14:52.000,00:14:58.375,"I am a snowflake, as special as can be."
00:14:58.417,00:14:59.792,There is...
00:15:02.041,00:15:06.959,...nobody else exactly like... me.
00:15:07.000,00:15:11.750,"I'm here to say, let's start the... play!"
00:15:42.417,00:15:44.709,- What's that noise?
00:15:56.417,00:15:59.250,3... 3...
00:16:05.208,00:16:09.750,- Three wishes! I can have anything I ask for?
00:16:09.792,00:16:11.458,"Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!"
00:16:16.000,00:16:20.750,- I wish for a...
00:16:25.625,00:16:28.041,- I am a present. Hoo-hoo!
00:16:28.083,00:16:31.291,- Hooray!
00:16:31.333,00:16:34.375,Excuse me.

00:16:38.667,00:16:42.458,- My second wish is...
00:16:48.125,00:16:50.375,- I really like presents.
00:16:52.166,00:16:56.667,"Meow, meow, wish!"
00:16:56.709,00:17:00.250,- I'm a present too.
00:17:04.625,00:17:06.583,- Sorry!
00:17:06.625,00:17:11.792,Presents don't talk.
00:17:11.834,00:17:19.542,"Now, little girl, what... is your last... wish?"
00:17:24.542,00:17:26.834,another present!
00:17:26.875,00:17:28.834,- What?! Another present?
00:17:28.875,00:17:30.959,Are you sure?
00:17:31.000,00:17:33.166,- I really like presents.
00:17:33.208,00:17:34.709,- OK.
00:17:34.750,00:17:38.792,"Meow, meow... wish!"
00:17:38.834,00:17:41.917,- I'm a present!
00:17:48.417,00:17:50.583,I hope you're happy!
00:17:50.625,00:17:53.250,- Ahhh.
00:17:58.208,00:17:59.959,"Hi, present."
00:18:02.000,00:18:05.125,- I'm just a present.
00:18:05.166,00:18:09.458,That's what friends do.
00:18:15.000,00:18:18.834,That's what friends do.
00:18:18.875,00:18:22.000,"Well, present, can I at least have a hug?"
00:18:22.041,00:18:25.542,- Hug? Presents don't give hugs.
00:18:25.583,00:18:27.375,That's what friends do.
00:18:27.417,00:18:29.333,- But... but...
00:18:29.375,00:18:32.500,I only have presents!
00:18:39.792,00:18:42.542,Boo-hoo!
00:18:47.542,00:18:54.458,"- This little girl needs friends, not presents."
00:19:03.875,00:19:06.542,"- Friends, not presents."
00:19:24.458,00:19:25.959,- Time to take this off.
00:19:26.000,00:19:28.208,- I can't see.
00:19:28.250,00:19:30.875,- Wait until you see what happens when the lights go on.
00:19:30.917,00:19:33.625,It's my favourite part of the show.
00:19:33.667,00:19:35.667,- I love this part!
00:19:38.250,00:19:42.041,- What happened?
00:19:42.083,00:19:45.083,"- Oh, no!"
00:19:45.125,00:19:47.625,How are we going to finish the show?
00:19:49.875,00:19:52.291,"Mom, why aren't the lights coming on?"
00:19:52.333,00:19:55.041,"- I don't know, Daniel."
00:19:52.333,00:19:57.166,"We will fix it, but it just might take a little while."
00:19:57.208,00:20:00.083,- We have to finish the Snowflake Day Show now!
00:20:00.125,00:20:02.834,But where can we get more lights?
00:20:08.583,00:20:15.333,"I am a snowflake, as special as can be."
00:20:15.375,00:20:20.709,Will everyone please turn on your lights so we can see?
00:20:20.750,00:20:24.208,Twinkle light here.
00:20:24.250,00:20:26.375,Twinkle light there.
00:20:29.709,00:20:33.834,"And now, the Snowflake Day Show can go on!"
00:20:33.875,00:20:35.792,"You see, Mom?"
00:20:35.834,00:20:37.959,The lanterns are lighting up the stage!
00:20:38.000,00:20:41.083,- It's beautiful!
00:20:45.417,00:20:49.333,I'm so proud of you for helping solve our problem.

00:21:34.375,00:21:36.500,"- Hi, friend."
00:21:36.542,00:21:39.583,Will you tell me a joke?
00:21:39.625,00:21:43.041,Hmm. What do snowmen eat for breakfast?
00:21:43.083,00:21:46.875,- What?
00:21:46.917,00:21:50.834,"Nom, nom, nom!"

00:01:18.625,00:01:24.250,"- Alright, Daniel and O, what should we fix on your playhouse?"
00:01:24.291,00:01:27.250,the doorbell!
00:01:27.291,00:01:29.417,- The doorbell won't ding-dong.
00:01:29.458,00:01:31.834,Just for pretend.
00:01:29.458,00:01:37.667,"- OK, you two fix the doorbell, and I'll be over here working on the house."
00:01:45.917,00:01:48.750,How about...
00:01:48.792,00:01:51.166,"- OK, I have my hammer too!"

00:02:55.750,00:02:58.709,Are you sure you don't want to use another tool?
00:03:04.166,00:03:06.333,"- Or, or... a wrench?"
00:03:08.959,00:03:11.166,- No... I think we need the hammer.
00:03:11.208,00:03:13.583,- Oh. OK. The hammer.

00:03:48.792,00:03:52.250,"- Why aren't you hammering, O?!"
00:03:56.208,00:03:58.792,- But... it doesn't hurt my ears...
00:04:04.542,00:04:09.083,Can you think about a time when something was too LOUD for you?
00:04:09.125,00:04:11.834,OK.
00:04:15.083,00:04:17.375,when Miss Elaina was being too loud.
00:04:20.125,00:04:22.291,right in my face!
00:04:24.458,00:04:30.125,"So now, can you use empathy, and think about how O the Owl is feeling?"
00:04:30.166,00:04:33.417,- Empathy?
00:04:42.959,00:04:45.834,- Hmmm...
00:04:45.875,00:04:50.625,"- Your hammering is too loud, it makes me jump. Hoo!"
00:04:50.667,00:04:53.291,"- I'm sorry, O..."
00:04:53.333,00:04:55.709,"- Thanks Daniel, hoo-hoo."
00:04:55.750,00:05:00.583,"- Now, that is empathy, because you're thinking about how your friend feels."
00:05:06.125,00:05:09.000,- Yes! We can fix it...
00:05:13.959,00:05:16.834,"- Hammer, hammer."
00:05:16.875,00:05:19.208,"- Yes, that's better, thank hoo."

00:05:21.417,00:05:23.375,- Hammer!
00:05:23.417,00:05:25.917,- I like hammering with you.
00:05:25.959,00:05:28.625,"Now, let's see if we fixed Trolley."
00:05:28.667,00:05:31.333,All fixed!
00:05:42.792,00:05:46.917,Like my screwdriver and my wrench...
00:05:46.959,00:05:50.083,because you need a lot of tools to fix things.
00:05:50.125,00:05:52.792,I like fixing things.
00:05:55.750,00:05:58.625,Let's make believe that...
00:06:49.291,00:06:52.041,- Ding! Ding!
00:06:49.291,00:06:54.709,"Now that we fixed Trolley, he wants to ride somewhere! Hoo-hoo."
00:06:54.750,00:07:01.166,- Hmmm... Trolley can ride to the kitchen...
00:07:01.208,00:07:04.041,Hey! I have an idea!
00:07:04.083,00:07:06.709,- What is it? Hoo-hoo!
00:07:09.500,00:07:12.667,and surprise her with it!
00:07:15.500,00:07:18.083,- Hmmm... I'm not sure.
00:07:20.083,00:07:22.959,- Mom likes... sunflowers!
00:07:23.000,00:07:25.625,Mom really likes sunflowers.
00:07:25.667,00:07:28.959,"Here, we can give her this sunflower!"

00:07:51.500,00:07:54.083,- Uh-oh!
00:07:54.125,00:07:57.458,- Look at it... I think my vase might be ruined.
00:07:57.500,00:08:00.291,Remember how we talked about empathy?
00:08:04.458,00:08:09.917,"- On Dress Up Day, I fell down and ripped my costume."
00:08:09.959,00:08:16.125,"My costume was ruined, remember?"
00:08:16.166,00:08:18.166,- Hoo-hoo.
00:08:21.000,00:08:23.709,I really like this vase.
00:08:23.750,00:08:26.792,"- Hoo-hoo, I'm sorry."
00:08:26.834,00:08:29.000,"- Hmmm, maybe we can fix it...."
00:08:29.041,00:08:31.291,together!
00:08:33.333,00:08:36.709,"- Yes, great idea!"
00:08:36.750,00:08:39.041,- One drop.
00:08:47.792,00:08:51.792,"Now, why was Trolley right in the middle of the floor?"
00:08:51.834,00:08:54.375,- We put a surprise inside Trolley for you!
00:08:58.542,00:09:00.750,That is a nice surprise!
00:09:00.792,00:09:03.208,"- You like sunflowers, right?"
00:09:03.250,00:09:07.083,Hoo-hoo.
00:10:20.917,00:10:26.583,"- Alright! Now, I'm gonna send a surprise back to you, OK?"

00:10:50.417,00:10:53.208,I had fun playing with you and O today.
00:10:53.250,00:10:55.625,You make me feel happy when I play with you.
00:10:58.333,00:11:00.500,Ugga-mugga.
00:11:06.959,00:11:10.083,"Hi, neighbour!"
00:11:14.917,00:11:17.417,"- Howdy! Hiya, neighbour!"
00:11:28.417,00:11:30.750,Stat!
00:11:30.792,00:11:35.583,"- Oh, that's what doctors say when they mean, NOW!"
00:11:35.625,00:11:38.834,"Come on, Doctor neighbour, let's go to the play corner..."
00:11:38.875,00:11:42.125,"STAT! That means, now!"
00:11:48.709,00:11:51.667,Chrissie's crutches help her walk.
00:11:55.542,00:11:58.375,Waah! Waah!
00:11:58.417,00:12:00.959,"I think this baby is sick, see?"
00:12:01.000,00:12:03.959,- Let's listen to her heartbeat with my stethoscope.
00:12:04.000,00:12:06.208,Hmmm...
00:12:06.250,00:12:08.875,- I hear...
00:12:08.917,00:12:11.959,Oooh... I like your bracelet.
00:12:12.000,00:12:14.291,"- Thanks, it's called a charm bracelet."
00:12:17.166,00:12:21.959,"This one is a heart that my Nana gave me to say, I love you."
00:12:22.000,00:12:26.333,- This one is a horse that I got to remind me of my horse Peaches.
00:12:26.375,00:12:28.333,- And this one is a pickle.
00:12:28.375,00:12:30.583,- A pickle?
00:12:33.291,00:12:35.875,- I like how the charms mean something.
00:12:35.917,00:12:39.125,- Me too.
00:12:39.166,00:12:43.792,"Uh-oh... the baby is crying more, she's getting worse!"
00:12:43.834,00:12:48.917,"- We should take her temperature, and see if she's too hot..."
00:12:48.959,00:12:51.291,- STAT!
00:12:51.333,00:12:54.750,"- Thanks, Doctor!"
00:12:59.583,00:13:01.917,I'll get her a bottle.
00:13:01.959,00:13:04.750,Waah! Waah!
00:13:04.792,00:13:07.667,- She's still crying!
00:13:04.792,00:13:10.625,"Oh, I feel sad when the baby cries."
00:13:10.667,00:13:15.709,"You rock the baby, and I will look for something to check her throat with."
00:13:18.750,00:13:21.500,"- Doctor Chrissie, the baby needs help..."
00:13:24.000,00:13:26.041,Where is it?
00:13:30.917,00:13:34.917,- But...
00:13:34.959,00:13:37.709,"- Hello, doctors!"
00:13:37.750,00:13:39.875,"- Teacher Harriet, I lost my bracelet!"
00:13:39.917,00:13:41.959,I can't find it anywhere!
00:13:42.000,00:13:46.083,"- Oh, dear me. Daniel and I will help you look for it."
00:13:53.792,00:13:56.333,"- Daniel, I don't want to play anymore."
00:13:56.375,00:13:59.500,- But I do!
00:13:56.375,00:14:01.959,"- Daniel, I know you want to play with Chrissie."
00:14:07.750,00:14:10.125,- Ummm...
00:14:10.166,00:14:15.208,"Hmmm, one time, when Prince Tuesday was babysitting, I lost Tigey!"
00:14:15.250,00:14:18.542,- And how did you feel when you lost Tigey?
00:14:18.583,00:14:21.500,- Ummm... I was feeling...
00:14:24.250,00:14:26.667,now use empathy...
00:14:36.417,00:14:37.959,- Hmmm!
00:14:42.709,00:14:48.250,"Chrissie, are you feeling upset like I did when I lost Tigey?"
00:14:48.291,00:14:50.542,- I am feeling upset.
00:14:50.583,00:14:52.834,I lost my bracelet.
00:14:57.166,00:14:59.291,- Mm-hmm!
00:15:01.625,00:15:04.291,- OK...
00:15:04.333,00:15:06.458,- Maybe under here?
00:15:09.000,00:15:11.542,- Where is it?
00:15:11.583,00:15:14.333,- It had a horse on it...
00:15:14.375,00:15:16.667,Help us find it.
00:15:16.709,00:15:19.208,- No.
00:15:19.250,00:15:22.083,"Uh, maybe it's with the other babies?"
00:15:22.125,00:15:24.583,Maybe it's in the baby's bed!
00:15:24.625,00:15:27.000,Let's look. No...
00:15:27.041,00:15:30.083,Ah! Chrissie's bracelet!
00:15:30.125,00:15:33.166,"Chrissie, we found your bracelet!"
00:15:36.041,00:15:41.083,"You found your bracelet, are you still upset?"
00:15:49.125,00:15:51.625,Happy!
00:15:54.750,00:15:56.959,Let's make it a game.
00:15:57.000,00:15:58.959,It's your turn to show a feeling!
00:15:59.000,00:16:02.250,"- OK, guess how I'm feeling!"
00:16:02.291,00:16:04.542,Grrrr!
00:16:06.583,00:16:09.208,- Mad!
00:16:09.250,00:16:11.417,"- Yup! Mad, mad, mad!"
00:16:11.458,00:16:13.542,I have a good one.
00:16:13.583,00:16:15.500,Guess how I'm feeling!
00:16:17.750,00:16:20.000,- What do you think Chrissie's feeling now?
00:16:22.542,00:16:25.375,Surprised!
00:16:25.417,00:16:28.500,"- Yes! Surprised, surprised, surprised!"
00:16:28.542,00:16:30.667,- Surprise! Ha! Ha! Ha!
00:16:30.709,00:16:34.542,Is this a surprise party?
00:16:34.583,00:16:36.542,"- Katerina, we were just playing a game."
00:16:36.583,00:16:38.542,- Oh!
00:16:41.208,00:16:43.959,Or maybe... sleepy?
00:16:44.000,00:16:49.041,"There are lots of feelings, like... excited! And scared..."
00:16:54.458,00:17:02.667,"Sillyyy! I know, let's make believe that we sing all about our feelings!"
00:17:21.709,00:17:24.208,- How do you feel?
00:17:38.166,00:17:41.458,- Wasn't that grrr-ific?
00:17:41.500,00:17:43.834,"can I hold the baby, meow-meow?"
00:17:43.875,00:17:46.041,- Sure!
00:17:53.125,00:17:55.667,And this is my little grandbaby.
00:17:58.917,00:18:02.083,"Here's your bottle, baby."
00:18:02.125,00:18:04.875,"My baby is hungry too, meow-meow."
00:18:16.667,00:18:18.792,- No... you can't have it.
00:18:18.834,00:18:20.834,- But... but... but...
00:18:20.875,00:18:24.041,My baby is so hungry.
00:18:24.083,00:18:26.125,"Waah, waah!"
00:18:26.166,00:18:29.125,"I want to feed my baby, meow-meow."
00:18:29.166,00:18:31.959,"- Hey, what's going on?"
00:18:32.000,00:18:34.375,- Daniel won't give me the baby bottle!
00:18:34.417,00:18:36.834,And my baby is hungry!
00:18:36.875,00:18:39.291,"Waah, waah!"
00:18:39.333,00:18:41.709,- But... I'm playing with the bottle.
00:18:41.750,00:18:44.375,"- Hmmm, could you try taking turns with the bottle?"
00:18:44.417,00:18:47.250,- I don't want to.
00:18:52.125,00:18:56.542,Can you think of a time when something like that happened to you?
00:18:56.583,00:19:01.500,- I remember when I wanted to play with Katerina's tutu.
00:19:01.542,00:19:03.500,But you were using it.
00:19:10.792,00:19:13.458,"Are you mad now, Katerina?"
00:19:18.291,00:19:20.917,"- I don't want you to feel mad, Katerina..."
00:19:20.959,00:19:25.750,We can take turns with the bottle.
00:19:25.792,00:19:28.333,"Gulp, gulp. OK..."
00:19:28.375,00:19:31.583,your turn.
00:19:31.625,00:19:33.875,"- Gulp, gulp, gulp."
00:19:33.917,00:19:36.208,Now my baby isn't hungry anymore...
00:19:36.250,00:19:39.333,"she feels happy, happy, happy!"
00:19:39.375,00:19:43.291,"- Oh, good!"
00:20:50.375,00:20:52.875,So... did I surprise you?
00:20:52.917,00:20:55.458,I'm... surprised! See?
00:20:55.500,00:20:58.125,- Me too!
00:20:58.166,00:21:00.500,- I even surprised myself!
00:21:02.875,00:21:05.542,- I thought a lot about how my friends were feeling today.
00:21:14.542,00:21:17.000,Ugga-mugga.
00:21:28.417,00:21:31.709,- Hi!
00:21:58.792,00:22:01.792,"Because, it's you I like."
00:00:55.458,00:00:58.458,Dad and I are about to check the mail. Check with us.
00:01:01.542,00:01:03.834,"- Look, we got a letter!"
00:01:03.875,00:01:06.834,- OK.
00:01:06.875,00:01:09.750,I wonder who it's from.
00:01:09.792,00:01:13.834,"La, la, dee, doo, dee, doo, doo, la, la, la."
00:01:13.875,00:01:17.000,- Here we go. Look.
00:01:19.000,00:01:21.166,- Yay! Grandpere!
00:01:27.000,00:01:29.291,- Right.
00:01:32.917,00:01:35.834,I wanted you to see the big fish I saw.
00:01:35.875,00:01:38.458,it's almost as big as Daniel.
00:01:38.500,00:01:43.000,- I miss my tiger family and think you often.
00:01:43.041,00:01:44.917,"Love, Grandpere."
00:01:48.375,00:01:50.333,- I miss Grandpere too.
00:01:57.083,00:02:00.959,And I love you. Grr.
00:02:06.125,00:02:10.709,- Did you see how happy my dad was? He really liked getting that letter.
00:02:10.750,00:02:12.458,"- Hi, honey. What's that?"
00:02:12.500,00:02:16.041,- A letter from Grandpere.
00:02:16.083,00:02:19.542,"- Hmm, well, Dad loves getting letters from people he cares about."
00:02:19.583,00:02:22.375,- Hmm... Mom?
00:02:22.417,00:02:25.333,Do you think Dad would like getting a letter from me?
00:02:35.250,00:02:41.166,"- Hey! I can make Dad a letter with a picture and send it to him, just like Grandpere's letter."
00:02:50.875,00:02:53.083,Will you write the words?
00:02:55.500,00:02:57.083,- Dear Dad...
00:03:00.458,00:03:02.709,"- Love, Daniel."
00:03:07.583,00:03:10.208,- First your letter has to go in an envelope.
00:03:10.250,00:03:13.375,"- Careful, careful."
00:03:13.417,00:03:16.625,Want to lick the envelope?
00:03:19.083,00:03:25.667,"- OK, now we write down our address so our postman, Mr. McFeely, knows where the letter is going."
00:03:25.709,00:03:28.792,- To our mailbox!
00:03:28.834,00:03:31.917,- That's right.
00:03:31.959,00:03:33.917,"- Ooh, I like this one."
00:03:33.959,00:03:35.542,OK.
00:03:35.583,00:03:38.875,- Great. Now let's take it to the post office.
00:03:38.917,00:03:41.542,a surprise for Dad.
00:03:41.583,00:03:45.834,surprises. To the post office.
00:03:45.875,00:03:50.417,Daniel and I are going out!
00:03:50.458,00:03:52.667,- Dad loves surprises.
00:03:52.709,00:03:54.458,"- Shush, shush, shush, shush."
00:04:02.083,00:04:15.375,to the post office - There's the post office.
00:04:17.375,00:04:19.709,Where do you think this mail is going?
00:04:19.750,00:04:22.083,"- Hmm, well, that could be going anywhere."
00:04:22.125,00:04:26.208,- Look at all of the packages in the post office!
00:04:32.542,00:04:36.333,"It could be a book, or a toy, or a trolley!"
00:04:39.875,00:04:42.083,Let's make believe...
00:04:42.125,00:04:46.875,that the packages could sing to us and tell us what's inside of them!
00:05:02.041,00:05:05.333,- Socks!
00:05:10.166,00:05:12.709,- A teddy bear!
00:05:23.417,00:05:26.083,"- Well, lucky me, lucky me."
00:05:26.125,00:05:28.667,I get a visit from Daniel Tiger today.
00:05:28.709,00:05:30.667,"And hello to you, Mrs. Tiger."
00:05:32.709,00:05:35.917,"- So, what can I help you with today, Daniel?"
00:05:35.959,00:05:44.458,"- I made this letter for my dad, and I want to send it to him to say, I love you."
00:05:50.834,00:05:53.125,- You know that song too?
00:05:53.166,00:05:56.709,- Word travels fast when you're speedy delivery.
00:05:56.750,00:05:58.542,"- So, can I send my letter?"
00:05:58.583,00:06:05.542,- Of course. First we need to put it through this machine.
00:06:05.583,00:06:10.583,It means the post office got the letter and will send it to the right place.
00:06:10.625,00:06:13.875,Now we put the letter in the right bin.
00:06:13.917,00:06:17.333,- Come on.
00:06:17.375,00:06:20.667,- These letters go to other parts of the world.
00:06:27.500,00:06:32.792,- Exactly. I was just getting ready to deliver some mail to the neighbourhood.
00:06:32.834,00:06:35.625,Would you like to come with me?
00:06:35.667,00:06:38.208,- Sounds like fun.
00:06:38.250,00:06:43.709,"- Well, then, let me just grab my mail bag, and away we go!"
00:06:43.750,00:06:47.208,Speedy delivery to you.
00:06:47.250,00:06:50.083,"- Hello, Trolley. Will you help me deliver the mail?"
00:06:53.333,00:06:55.542,- Buckle up.
00:07:06.542,00:07:10.667,- Here's our first stop.
00:07:10.709,00:07:18.041,"- Yessiree, and we have one letter for Katerina, and one for O. Would you like to put them in their mailboxes?"

00:15:20.083,00:15:27.792,"Or maybe I should make a note for Prince Wednesday, because he always makes me laugh!"
00:15:27.834,00:15:30.500,I don't know.
00:15:30.542,00:15:33.000,Look at the notes on the Thank You tree!
00:15:33.041,00:15:35.291,What do you think they say?

00:11:22.000,00:11:24.208,And we're going to surprise her with a party.
00:11:33.792,00:11:38.333,And Mom is going to help us surprise Teacher Harriet.
00:11:52.458,00:11:56.959,"Don't worry, Mom. I'll make sure Teacher Harriet doesn't see the birthday bag."
00:11:57.000,00:12:01.458,Grr. Shh! Let's go inside.

00:13:04.291,00:13:09.333,- Teacher Harriet loves rainbows! Can we make her a rainbow with streamers?
00:13:09.375,00:13:11.333,- I think that's a lovely idea.
00:13:11.375,00:13:14.917,"- Good idea, toots!"
00:13:17.834,00:13:19.792,"- I want yellow, please, meow-meow!"
00:13:19.834,00:13:23.500,- Green for me!
00:13:23.542,00:13:26.959,Weee! Meow-meow!
00:13:31.709,00:13:35.417,Hoo-hoo? Rainbow down. Hoo-hoo.
00:13:35.458,00:13:40.709,Rainbow up! Hoo-hoo?
00:13:40.750,00:13:44.750,- Orange rainbow?
00:13:44.792,00:13:47.583,"- Blue, blue, blue, blue!"
00:13:47.625,00:13:49.291,"- Be careful, everyone."
00:13:49.333,00:13:53.959,- Mom! Grr! I can't make a rainbow with only one colour.
00:13:56.000,00:13:57.583,- Neither can I.
00:13:57.625,00:14:00.291,- And... I-I think I'm stuck.
00:14:00.333,00:14:02.000,Meow-meow.
00:14:02.041,00:14:06.166,"- Aw, let me help you, toots."
00:14:09.375,00:14:14.542,- We need all the colours TOGETHER to make a rainbow for Teacher Harriet's birthday.
00:14:14.583,00:14:17.166,See? Together. Hoo-hoo!
00:14:17.208,00:14:23.291,"- Well, if you want all the rainbow colours together, you need to work together."
00:14:31.583,00:14:34.500,- Let's work together to make a rainbow.
00:14:38.875,00:14:41.375,- Surprise!
00:14:46.667,00:14:50.166,"- OK, kids, let's get these colours in rainbow order!"
00:14:52.208,00:14:55.750,- The first colour in the rainbow is... red.
00:15:02.542,00:15:05.834,"- OK, next comes orange."
00:15:05.875,00:15:08.458,"- Hmm, who has the orange?"
00:15:12.417,00:15:14.375,Orange! Grr!
00:15:22.542,00:15:24.250,- Here's the green!

00:15:27.375,00:15:29.959,"- OK! Now, walk together!"
00:15:33.125,00:15:36.333,"- It looks like a rainbow, meow-meow!"
00:15:39.959,00:15:43.250,"- OK, now, everyone hold your streamer up so I can tape it."
00:15:43.291,00:15:46.375,- Hoo-hoo!
00:15:46.417,00:15:48.542,- Here you go!

00:15:52.125,00:15:55.542,- Look at that!
00:15:55.583,00:15:57.709,- That's awesome!
00:15:59.583,00:16:01.750,And purple. Done!
00:16:01.792,00:16:03.917,There! Rainbow streamers!

00:16:13.000,00:16:17.000,What's your favourite colour?
00:16:20.375,00:16:24.000,"Hey, do you want to make believe with me?"
00:16:24.041,00:16:29.750,Let's make believe...
00:17:01.750,00:17:05.834,Wasn't that grr-ific?
00:17:09.500,00:17:11.458,- OK!
00:17:19.792,00:17:23.000,- Nice working together!
00:17:19.792,00:17:25.792,"Now, do you want to make birthday presents out of clay for Teacher Harriet?"
00:17:25.834,00:17:29.583,- Yes! I'll use the orange clay.
00:17:29.625,00:17:31.583,- I'll make something with yellow clay!
00:17:34.250,00:17:39.375,"- I'll use the red, meow-meow."
00:17:39.417,00:17:41.542,- Mine's a... ball.
00:17:41.583,00:17:43.792,Splat ball! Ha! Ha!
00:17:43.834,00:17:48.417,- Hmm. I'm going to make...
00:17:48.458,00:17:51.583,"- Meow-meow, good idea."
00:18:10.417,00:18:15.041,I know! We can work together like we did with the streamers.
00:18:18.667,00:18:20.709,- That's a good idea.
00:18:20.750,00:18:23.542,- I'll put my red for the bottom. Mmm!
00:18:25.875,00:18:28.583,- Here's the yellow clay.
00:18:35.542,00:18:37.500,- Lookin' good!
00:18:37.542,00:18:40.125,- Rainbow-licious!
00:18:40.166,00:18:42.917,We worked together to make the rainbow cake!
00:19:27.083,00:19:53.000,with your friends than - Do you hear that singing?
00:19:53.041,00:19:57.792,I think it's Teacher Harriet!
00:19:57.834,00:19:59.792,- Here she comes!
00:19:59.834,00:20:02.500,- Here comes teacher Harriet!
00:20:02.542,00:20:06.166,Teacher Harriet.
00:20:06.208,00:20:10.583,"When you see her come in, say, Surprise! Ready?"

00:20:23.959,00:20:26.792,"- We worked together to make that rainbow, hoo-hoo!"
00:20:26.834,00:20:30.875,"- Meow-meow and we made you a present too, meow-meow."
00:20:30.917,00:20:34.917,"- Oh, my! A rainbow cake?"
00:20:37.583,00:20:39.041,- We worked together!
00:20:39.083,00:20:42.041,- What a wonderful present.
00:20:42.083,00:20:45.583,Thank you for making my birthday so special.
00:20:45.625,00:20:47.667,"- Happy birthday, Teacher Harriet!"
00:20:47.709,00:20:49.834,What's a birthday cake without a candle?
00:20:49.875,00:20:52.041,- And now we are going to sing!
00:21:05.625,00:21:08.625,What did you make?
00:21:17.583,00:21:30.208,to play with family - Hi!
00:00:51.750,00:00:56.125,"- Hi, neighbour! I'm going to have breakfast. Come on in!"
00:01:00.500,00:01:02.125,"Good morning, Mom!"
00:01:02.166,00:01:04.333,"- Good morning, Daniel."
00:01:13.000,00:01:17.166,- Hmm... I like hot oatmeal AND cold cereal.
00:01:17.208,00:01:21.583,Which one would you choose?
00:01:21.625,00:01:25.333,"- Well, when you have to make a choice, you should..."
00:01:35.625,00:01:37.750,So some hot oatmeal will warm me up.
00:01:37.792,00:01:40.166,I choose...
00:01:44.959,00:01:46.458,"- Thanks, Mom!"
00:01:49.750,00:01:51.750,There you go.
00:01:51.792,00:01:55.125,- Me too. I love Mom's famous oatmeal.
00:01:59.208,00:02:01.542,"So, what are we going to do today?"
00:02:01.583,00:02:04.375,- We're going to Clock Factory Park today.
00:02:14.375,00:02:18.375,- Trolley's here! Let's go!
00:02:23.875,00:02:25.834,"Hi, Trolley!"
00:02:25.875,00:02:29.000,"- Up we go, Daniel."
00:02:29.041,00:02:43.041,"to see what King Friday has - Thanks, Trolley!"
00:02:45.000,00:02:47.333,Are you here for King Friday's announcement?
00:02:47.375,00:02:49.750,"- Yes, and my neighbour came too."
00:02:49.792,00:02:52.375,"- Hoo-hoo, hi, neighbour."
00:02:52.417,00:02:54.583,- King Friday's here!
00:02:54.625,00:02:57.583,- Let's go see what he's going to say!
00:02:57.625,00:03:00.792,Hoo-hoo.
00:03:08.583,00:03:13.417,Today you will choose to add a new swing set...
00:03:13.458,00:03:17.333,or a slide to our playground.
00:03:17.375,00:03:19.333,These aren't big enough for kids.
00:03:30.583,00:03:32.542,Ha! Ha! Ha!
00:03:32.583,00:03:37.166,- Yay!
00:03:37.208,00:03:44.709,"- After you stop and think about what you want, you will be voting right over here!"
00:03:44.750,00:03:47.959,"- Um, what's voting?"
00:03:48.000,00:03:51.375,- My son has asked an excellent question.
00:03:51.417,00:03:56.750,Voting is a way for us to decide together what we will put in our playground.
00:03:56.792,00:04:02.375,"- If more children choose the slide, we will get the slide!"
00:04:02.417,00:04:06.709,"If more children want swings, we will get the swings!"
00:04:19.959,00:04:24.291,"- Oh, boy! We get to choose swings or slide for our playground!"
00:04:24.333,00:04:28.500,"- Daniel, what will you pick?"
00:04:28.542,00:04:32.375,"- I don't know. I have to stop and think, I guess."
00:04:32.417,00:04:36.166,- I want slide! I bet Tigey wants a slide like me!
00:04:36.208,00:04:39.166,"Look how fun it is, meow-meow! Weee!"
00:04:39.208,00:04:41.166,- I'm going to choose swings.
00:04:41.208,00:04:43.375,Wha-ohhh!
00:04:43.417,00:04:46.375,I think Tigey likes the swings too! Ha! Ha! Ha!
00:04:46.417,00:04:48.458,- I like the swings too.
00:04:48.500,00:04:51.083,Swings feel like flying!
00:04:51.125,00:04:55.542,"- Tigey, what should I choose?"
00:04:58.417,00:05:02.542,"I like the slide and the swings, but I don't know what to choose."
00:05:05.750,00:05:08.458,I wish I could play on them now to help me decide.
00:05:51.250,00:05:54.542,Wasn't that grr-ific?
00:05:54.583,00:05:57.750,I know what to choose! Slide!
00:05:57.792,00:06:01.917,Tigey likes the slide too.
00:06:05.208,00:06:09.041,- Royal greetings.
00:06:05.208,00:06:13.583,I hereby declare that it is time to vote!
00:06:13.625,00:06:20.333,- Please go into this voting booth and choose swings or slide.
00:06:26.208,00:06:29.542,"How exciting! Vote, vote, vote!"
00:06:29.583,00:06:32.959,"- So, Daniel, do you know what you're going to vote for?"
00:06:36.000,00:06:40.250,"- Yes. I thought about it, and I want to go fast, fast, fast!"
00:06:42.959,00:06:48.291,"- Well, I'm glad you've decided, because... it's our turn to vote!"
00:06:48.333,00:06:52.208,- Your turn.
00:06:52.250,00:06:55.166,It's like a little room in here!
00:07:00.417,00:07:04.542,"- Yes, indeed. It's a good place to think before you vote."
00:07:04.583,00:07:08.125,"- So, how do I vote?"
00:07:12.291,00:07:14.333,"What would you like to vote for, Daniel?"
00:07:17.583,00:07:20.166,I choose to vote for slide!
00:07:20.208,00:07:24.709,"- OK, now make a mark next to the slide to vote for it."
00:07:29.583,00:07:35.333,"- Then the votes will be counted, and whichever has the most votes wins."
00:07:38.333,00:07:39.667,- Royal greetings.
00:07:39.709,00:07:41.750,Royal greetings.
00:07:46.917,00:07:50.083,- Let's count the votes for slide together.
00:07:53.959,00:07:56.542,- That's two votes for slide.
00:08:03.792,00:08:06.291,- That's three votes for swings.
00:08:06.333,00:08:08.291,Swings have more votes.
00:08:08.333,00:08:10.083,The swings win!
00:08:10.125,00:08:12.333,- Yes!
00:08:12.375,00:08:15.750,- Hoo-hoo!
00:08:18.333,00:08:20.709,"- No, Daniel."
00:08:20.750,00:08:22.959,I feel disappointed.
00:08:23.000,00:08:25.333,"- Did you vote for slide too, meow-meow?"
00:08:25.375,00:08:27.375,- Yeah.
00:08:34.583,00:08:36.750,- Not yet.
00:08:36.792,00:08:39.000,"- Well, maybe later."
00:08:41.250,00:08:44.083,- I have a special delivery!
00:09:05.583,00:09:07.875,- Look how many swings!
00:09:09.917,00:09:14.166,"- It would be fun to all swing together, meow-meow."
00:09:16.375,00:09:19.917,That IS something good about the swings! Let's go!
00:09:23.959,00:09:27.125,- Whoa!
00:09:27.166,00:09:28.959,swings!
00:10:32.834,00:10:34.792,- Whoa!
00:10:36.750,00:10:40.125,- Swings are fun!
00:10:40.166,00:10:45.125,"- You know, Mom, the swings were a good choice because we can all swing together!"
00:10:45.166,00:10:47.667,- I'm glad you found something good.
00:10:47.709,00:10:51.750,- I made a lot of choices today.
00:10:51.792,00:10:55.333,What do you do when you have to make a choice? I...
00:11:07.125,00:11:09.709,"- Hi, neighbour!"
00:11:09.750,00:11:12.125,- We're at school.
00:11:12.166,00:11:15.375,- Roar! Roaaaarrr!
00:11:15.417,00:11:17.834,"- Hi, Daniel."
00:11:17.875,00:11:21.917,Say hi to my pet baby dinosaur.
00:11:28.834,00:11:35.500,"- We're going to decide as a class whether we want to eat inside, or outside."
00:11:38.041,00:11:41.000,"- Hold on, hold on."
00:11:47.709,00:11:52.583,- Think before you pick where you want to have snack. OK?
00:11:57.250,00:11:59.375,And I'm kind of cold. Brrr!
00:11:59.417,00:12:01.667,So I'm going to pick inside.
00:12:16.458,00:12:19.875,"One, two. Two children want to eat outside."
00:12:19.917,00:12:24.000,"So, three votes for inside, and two votes for outside."
00:12:31.667,00:12:33.375,- Everyone take a seat at the table.
00:12:33.417,00:12:36.625,- Meow!
00:12:36.667,00:12:40.625,"- But... Teacher Harriet, I want to eat outside."
00:12:40.667,00:12:47.792,"- I know you picked outside, but more children picked inside, so inside won the vote."
00:12:50.083,00:12:53.458,- Can you find something good about eating snack inside?
00:12:58.041,00:13:00.792,- Roar! Sitting next to Katerina.
00:13:00.834,00:13:02.375,That's something good.
00:13:02.417,00:13:05.125,Roarrr!
00:13:05.166,00:13:07.583,"- Ooh, carrots!"
00:13:07.625,00:13:09.834,- Meow-meow!
00:13:07.625,00:13:12.208,"- Prince Wednesday, would you pass me a tomato please? Thank you."
00:13:12.250,00:13:15.208,"- OK, class, it's circle time!"
00:13:15.250,00:13:17.709,Come to the rug for circle time.
00:13:17.750,00:13:20.750,- It's circle time!
00:13:20.792,00:13:22.750,- Right this way.
00:13:22.792,00:13:25.000,"- Meow. Come to the meeting, Baby Dino."
00:13:34.083,00:13:36.000,- Yeah!
00:14:01.250,00:14:02.834,"- Hold on, hold on."
00:14:02.875,00:14:05.625,A turtle and a rabbit are very different.
00:14:12.458,00:14:14.625,- ...just like we did for snack time!
00:14:14.667,00:14:16.792,- Can we get a turtle AND a rabbit?
00:14:20.834,00:14:24.041,"- Well, taking care of a pet is a lot of work."
00:14:24.083,00:14:32.208,"- So that means that not everybody will get what they want, just like snack time."
00:14:36.291,00:14:40.542,I don't know which one I want to pick! This is a big choice.
00:14:44.834,00:14:50.041,And here are some books so you can think about what you'll want to vote for.
00:14:50.083,00:14:53.542,You can play with this pretend bunny and a pretend turtle.
00:14:56.834,00:14:59.250,There's a book for that!
00:15:02.250,00:15:06.208,Turtles can put their heads in their shells... like this!
00:15:06.250,00:15:08.583,I'm a turtle.
00:15:15.834,00:15:19.917,It's so soft and fluffy!
00:15:26.250,00:15:28.208,Hop away!
00:15:28.250,00:15:33.875,"- Oh, it looks like everyone is playing and thinking about which animal to pick for our class pet."
00:15:42.834,00:15:45.000,- I don't know which pet to choose.
00:15:45.041,00:15:49.208,"Turtle, or rabbit?"
00:15:51.709,00:15:55.625,- Well... think about what it would be like to take care of each pet.
00:15:57.750,00:15:59.792,"- What do bunnies eat, meow-meow?"

00:16:22.250,00:16:27.834,"- We would have to brush the rabbit, and we would need to clean out both of their cages."
00:16:32.667,00:16:37.333,- Turtles like to swim?
00:16:37.375,00:16:42.000,There are lots of good things about turtles AND bunnies.
00:16:42.041,00:16:44.834,I still don't know which pet to vote for!

00:17:44.458,00:17:46.542,- Guess what?
00:17:44.458,00:17:53.041,"I thought about it, and now I know which pet I want to pick: the turtle! I can watch the turtle swim!"

00:18:34.250,00:18:40.333,- I pick the rabbit because I would like to feed him carrots.
00:18:40.375,00:18:42.500,- It's my turn to vote!

00:20:59.625,00:21:04.250,- Yeah! Snowball the fluffy rabbit!
00:21:07.291,00:21:14.583,"It was hard when I didn't get my choice for the class pet, but I think I'm going to like helping take care of Snowball."

00:15:35.125,00:15:37.333,- Sorry didn't help!
00:15:37.375,00:15:43.709,"- It's good that you said sorry, Miss Elaina, but sometimes you need to do more than say I'm sorry."
00:15:45.792,00:16:06.125,"- Yes. You know what we say: - You said you were sorry, but the next step is asking how you can help him feel better."
00:16:06.166,00:16:07.750,- Oh!

00:18:33.083,00:18:35.542,"- Oh, no! I didn't mean to do that!"
00:18:59.000,00:19:03.375,I know what to do!
00:19:03.417,00:19:07.083,"Katerina, how can I help you feel better?"

00:02:23.458,00:02:27.625,- Prince Wednesday can do a magic trick? Hoo-hoo-hoo!
00:02:31.041,00:02:33.542,I can't do a magic trick.
00:02:33.583,00:02:40.917,"- O the Owl, would you like to go now?"
00:02:40.959,00:02:43.750,"Maybe if I do a magic trick, I'll be special too!"
00:02:43.792,00:02:46.250,I don't know about this.
00:02:48.458,00:02:53.041,Ta-dah! I'm royally gonna do a magic trick!

00:03:17.500,00:03:19.750,You can be yourself!
00:03:19.792,00:03:22.000,- Be myself?
00:03:25.083,00:03:27.875,- Yes. There is no other owl like you.
00:03:27.917,00:03:30.625,So what would O the Owl like to do?
00:03:30.667,00:03:32.375,- Hmm... can I think about it?
00:03:32.417,00:03:34.625,- Sure.

00:04:19.625,00:04:24.959,Let's make believe that I was putting on a big singing show!
00:04:59.458,00:05:03.041,Wasn't that grr-ific?
00:05:03.083,00:05:06.333,"I like your song, Daniel."
00:05:09.583,00:05:12.542,"- Meow-meow, can I go next, pretty please?"

00:06:14.083,00:06:16.458,But I want to twirl like Katerina!
00:06:31.834,00:06:35.500,- Well... I need to think some more about what I can do.

00:07:30.583,00:07:33.500,"- I want to do a puppet show, just like you!"
00:07:46.417,00:07:50.500,- But... I don't do magic tricks like Prince Wednesday.
00:07:52.625,00:07:55.166,or sing like Daniel.
00:07:55.208,00:07:57.959,- And I don't do puppet shows like Miss Elaina...
00:08:11.667,00:08:14.000,- Hoo-hoo! Like what?

00:08:36.458,00:08:43.166,"- You see, O, you don't have to be like anybody else, you can just be yourself."
00:08:51.625,00:08:54.000,- Thanks. Hoo-hoo!

00:09:27.458,00:09:30.375,"- O, I didn't know you could do that!"
00:09:30.417,00:09:33.750,I wish I could do a flying flip just like you.
00:09:33.792,00:09:35.917,"- Hoo-hoo! Thanks, Daniel."
00:09:35.959,00:09:38.458,But you don't have to do a flip like me.
00:09:45.875,00:09:47.792,"- Thanks, O."
00:10:48.625,00:10:50.959,What is something special that you can do?

00:16:58.417,00:17:02.291,"- I know. But, did you know that leaf piles are fun to jump in?"

00:18:06.250,00:18:09.542,"- Bye, Daniel!"
00:18:09.583,00:18:12.583,"- Bye, O."
00:18:12.625,00:18:14.792,"Daniel, look! I see some more leaves for your picture!"
00:18:17.208,00:18:19.875,- This is one of my favourite times of year.
