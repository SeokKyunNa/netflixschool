00:01:21.498,00:01:22.499,It's just water.
00:01:24.543,00:01:25.669,It's a lot of water.
00:01:26.962,00:01:32.926,A lot of-- Come on.
00:01:57.284,00:02:03.540,"-You okay, boss? -Yeah, I'm fine, I just… I just can't-- can't stomach the water."
00:02:07.878,00:02:09.880,-You're my new partner. -That's right.
00:02:11.673,00:02:14.259,"Not the best way to meet, with my head halfway down the toilet."
00:02:14.801,00:02:18.680,"Doesn't exactly square with Teddy Daniels, the man of the legend, I'll give you that."
00:02:18.764,00:02:19.765,The legend?
00:02:20.432,00:02:22.851,"What the hell you boys smoking over there in Portland, anyway?"
00:02:23.226,00:02:24.227,Seattle.
00:02:24.519,00:02:26.146,I came from the office in Seattle.
00:02:29.274,00:02:30.734,How long you been with the Marshals?
00:02:31.485,00:02:32.486,Four years.
00:02:34.571,00:02:35.864,So you know how small it is.
00:02:37.282,00:02:38.283,Sure.
00:02:39.409,00:02:41.662,What about you? You got a girl? Married?
00:02:43.163,00:02:44.164,I was.
00:02:56.593,00:02:57.594,She died.
00:02:58.595,00:03:01.264,-Jesus. I don't-- -Don't worry about it.
00:03:02.933,00:03:05.519,There was a fire at the apartment building while I was at work.
00:03:06.603,00:03:07.646,Four people died.
00:03:08.438,00:03:10.190,"It was the smoke that got her, not the fire."
00:03:10.273,00:03:13.026,"-See, that's-- that's important. -I'm sorry, boss."
00:03:13.944,00:03:16.738,Where are my goddamn cigarettes?
00:03:16.988,00:03:18.824,"Here, have one of mine."
00:03:19.408,00:03:22.703,I could've sworn they were in my jacket before I got on.
00:03:22.786,00:03:24.913,Government employees will rob you blind.
00:03:27.958,00:03:28.959,Thanks.
00:03:30.210,00:03:32.838,They give you a briefing about the institution before you left?
00:03:33.004,00:03:34.923,All I know is it's a mental hospital.
00:03:39.594,00:03:44.224,"Well, if it was just folks running around hearing voices and chasing after butterflies, they wouldn't need us."
00:03:54.693,00:03:57.237,-Is that where we're headed? -Yep.
00:03:57.904,00:03:59.781,The other side of the island is rock bluffs.
00:04:00.323,00:04:02.242,All the way down to the edge of the water.
00:04:03.076,00:04:06.413,"The dock, it's the only way on, or off."
00:04:07.539,00:04:10.000,We'll be casting off as soon as you two are ashore.
00:04:10.542,00:04:12.586,I'd appreciate it if you'd hurry up about it.
00:04:13.211,00:04:15.380,-Why? -Storm's coming.
00:04:42.407,00:04:43.992,Never seen a Marshal's badge before.
00:04:46.787,00:04:49.748,"I'm Deputy Warden McPherson, gentlemen. Welcome to Shutter Island."
00:04:49.956,00:04:51.374,I'll be the one taking you up to Ashecliffe.
00:05:05.347,00:05:07.682,"Your boys seem a little on edge, Mr. McPherson."
00:05:08.225,00:05:09.976,"Right now, Marshal, we all are."
00:05:54.604,00:05:56.189,Electrified perimeter.
00:05:58.775,00:05:59.776,How can you tell?
00:06:00.902,00:06:02.612,I've seen something like it before.
00:06:33.059,00:06:35.353,You gentlemen will be accorded all the help we can give.
00:06:35.937,00:06:38.648,"But during your stay, you will obey protocol."
00:06:38.982,00:06:39.983,Is that understood?
00:06:40.358,00:06:41.359,Absolutely.
00:06:42.277,00:06:45.155,"The red brick building on your right is Ward A, the male ward."
00:06:45.655,00:06:48.366,"Ward B, the female ward, is the one on your left."
00:06:49.075,00:06:51.786,"Ward C, is that building on the bluffs."
00:06:52.120,00:06:53.371,An old Civil War fort.
00:06:53.830,00:06:55.832,The most dangerous patients are housed there.
00:06:56.291,00:07:02.631,"Admittance to Ward C is forbidden, without the written consent and physical presence of both myself and Dr. Cawley."
00:07:03.840,00:07:04.841,Is that understood?
00:07:06.384,00:07:08.428,You act like insanity is catching.
00:07:11.723,00:07:14.142,You are hereby required to surrender your firearms.
00:07:16.478,00:07:19.856,"Mr. McPherson, we are duly appointed federal marshals."
00:07:19.940,00:07:22.525,We are required to carry our firearms with us at all times.
00:07:22.609,00:07:30.533,"Executive order 319 of the Federal Code of Penitentiaries states that when inside a penitentiary, the officers of that institution have final authority."
00:07:34.120,00:07:36.456,"Gentlemen, you will not get through this gate with your firearms."
00:07:57.560,00:08:00.313,"Okay, now that the official stuff's done, come on, boys."
00:08:00.897,00:08:02.565,What do you say we go find Dr. Cawley?
00:08:15.036,00:08:17.330,When did she escape? This prisoner?
00:08:17.580,00:08:20.250,I'm afraid Dr. Cawley will have to fill you in on the situation.
00:08:20.917,00:08:21.918,Protocol.
00:08:22.002,00:08:26.256,"Correctional officers at a mental institution, that's a weird sight, if you don't mind me saying."
00:08:28.758,00:08:29.759,even the world.
00:08:29.843,00:08:34.139,"We take only the most dangerous, damaged patients, ones no other hospital can manage."
00:08:34.431,00:08:36.057,And it's all due to Dr. Cawley.
00:08:36.516,00:08:38.018,He's created something really unique here.
00:08:38.560,00:08:41.980,It's a hospital for people our society normally considers beyond treatment.
00:09:06.713,00:09:16.639,"Top of his class at Johns Hopkins, then Harvard… Show your badges, gentlemen."
00:09:17.557,00:09:23.980,"Dr. Cawley's been consulted numerous times by Scotland Yard, -MI5, the OSS. -Why?"
00:09:25.065,00:09:26.066,What do you mean?
00:09:28.109,00:09:31.488,What do intelligence agencies want to consult a psychiatrist about?
00:09:31.571,00:09:33.073,I guess you'll have to ask him.
00:09:43.583,00:09:45.085,-Marshal Daniels. -Doctor.
00:09:46.169,00:09:47.170,Marshal Aule.
00:09:48.171,00:09:49.756,"Thank you, Deputy Warden. That will be all."
00:09:50.924,00:09:53.468,"Yes, sir. Pleasure, gentlemen."
00:09:55.220,00:09:56.888,He had a lot to say about you.
00:09:57.013,00:09:59.641,McPherson's a good man. He believes in the work we do here.
00:10:00.183,00:10:01.893,"And what would that be, exactly?"
00:10:02.602,00:10:05.772,A moral fusion between law and order and clinical care.
00:10:16.407,00:10:18.201,Those paintings are quite accurate.
00:10:19.536,00:10:24.082,Used to be the kind of patients we deal with here were shackled and left in their own filth.
00:10:24.874,00:10:28.419,"They were beaten, as if whipping them bloody would drive the psychosis out."
00:10:28.503,00:10:36.344,"We drove screws into their brains, we submerged them in icy water until they lost consciousness or… even drowned."
00:10:39.180,00:10:40.515,"Try to heal, try to cure."
00:10:41.349,00:10:44.894,"And if that fails, at least we provide them with a measure of comfort in their lives."
00:10:45.061,00:10:46.062,Calm.
00:10:46.563,00:10:52.068,"These are all violent offenders, right? I mean… they've hurt people."
00:10:52.986,00:10:55.655,"-Murdered them in some cases. -In almost all cases, yes."
00:10:56.823,00:11:00.243,"Then, personally, Doctor, I'd have to say, screw their sense of calm."
00:11:02.579,00:11:04.873,"It's my job to treat my patients, not their victims."
00:11:04.956,00:11:06.124,I'm not here to judge.
00:11:06.374,00:11:09.002,-So this female prisoner-- -Patient.
00:11:10.003,00:11:17.010,"Excuse me, patient, one Rachel Solando, escaped sometime in the last 24 hours."
00:11:17.093,00:11:19.345,"Last night, between ten and midnight."
00:11:19.429,00:11:20.889,Is she considered dangerous?
00:11:21.097,00:11:24.309,You could say that. She killed all three of her children.
00:11:25.643,00:11:27.645,She drowned them in the lake behind her house.
00:11:28.605,00:11:34.986,"She took them out one by one, held their heads under till they died, then she brought them back inside and arranged them around the kitchen table."
00:11:35.069,00:11:36.946,She ate a meal there before a neighbor dropped by.
00:11:40.283,00:11:43.953,-And what about the husband? -He died on the beaches of Normandy.
00:11:44.162,00:11:45.413,She's a war widow.
00:11:45.997,00:11:48.124,She starved herself when she first came here.
00:11:48.249,00:11:50.084,She insisted the children weren't dead.
00:12:01.012,00:12:03.765,"Sorry, Doctor, you don't happen to have an aspirin, do you?"
00:12:05.516,00:12:08.937,"Sometimes, but today, I'm a little more prone to seasickness."
00:12:10.855,00:12:12.357,"-You all right, boss? -Yeah."
00:12:12.565,00:12:14.859,"In that case, you're quite right. The simpler the better."
00:12:15.276,00:12:16.319,Thanks so much.
00:12:17.737,00:12:19.948,Rachel still believes the children are alive.
00:12:21.449,00:12:24.035,She also believes this place is her home in the Berkshires.
00:12:26.496,00:12:30.541,"-You're kidding me. -She's, never once in two years, acknowledged that she's in an institution."
00:12:30.625,00:12:33.836,"She believes we're all deliverymen, milkmen, postal workers."
00:12:34.420,00:12:41.552,"To sustain the delusion that her children never died, she's created an elaborate fictional structure, and she gives us all parts to play in that fiction."
00:12:43.221,00:12:45.139,So have you-- have you searched the grounds yet?
00:12:45.390,00:12:47.600,The warden and his men scoured the island.
00:12:47.976,00:12:49.143,Not a trace.
00:12:50.061,00:12:52.981,"And what's more disturbing is, we don't know how she got out of her room."
00:12:54.691,00:12:58.236,"It was locked from the outside, and the only window is barred."
00:13:01.447,00:13:03.825,It's as if she evaporated straight through the walls.
00:13:10.790,00:13:17.005,"I brought her right back here after group therapy, locked her in, came back for a midnight round, she was gone."
00:13:24.387,00:13:28.308,"Seriously, doctor, how is it possible that the truth never gets through to her?"
00:13:28.683,00:13:31.227,"I mean, she's in a mental institution, right?"
00:13:31.769,00:13:33.730,Seems like something you'd notice from time to time.
00:13:33.855,00:13:35.982,How many pairs of shoes are the patients given?
00:13:36.065,00:13:37.066,Two pairs.
00:13:37.483,00:13:41.279,"Sanity's not a choice, Marshal. You can't just choose to get over it."
00:13:42.405,00:13:45.450,"So, she left here barefoot?"
00:13:46.284,00:13:49.037,"Come on, Doc, she couldn't get ten yards in that terrain."
00:14:10.767,00:14:12.810,This is definitely Rachel's handwriting.
00:14:12.894,00:14:15.855,"I have no idea what the law of four is, though."
00:14:15.938,00:14:18.316,-It's not a psychiatric term? -I'm afraid not.
00:14:18.733,00:14:20.068,Who is 67?
00:14:21.694,00:14:22.695,Fuck if I know.
00:14:22.779,00:14:25.239,I have to say that's quite close to my clinical conclusion.
00:14:26.616,00:14:28.201,Think it's just random scribblings?
00:14:28.618,00:14:31.871,"Oh, no, not at all. Rachel's smart. Brilliant, in fact."
00:14:32.413,00:14:33.873,This paper could be important.
00:14:33.998,00:14:36.751,"Excuse me, Doctor, but we're gonna have to hold on to this."
00:14:36.959,00:14:37.960,Of course.
00:14:47.553,00:14:51.891,"Last night, there were seven men sitting at the base of those stairs playing stud poker."
00:14:52.517,00:14:55.061,"Yet somehow, Rachel managed to slip past them."
00:14:56.187,00:14:59.482,-Why? -How? She turns invisible?
00:15:00.817,00:15:04.070,"Doctor, we're gonna need access to the personnel files of all the medical staff."
00:15:04.153,00:15:07.073,"The nurses, the guards, the orderlies, anyone who was working then."
00:15:07.156,00:15:09.117,We'll take your request under consideration.
00:15:12.620,00:15:21.671,"This is a federal facility and a dangerous prisoner-- -Patient. -Patient… has escaped. Now, you will comply -or-- -All I can say is, I'll see what I can do."
00:15:22.296,00:15:25.049,"Doctor, we're gonna need to speak with the staff."
00:15:25.133,00:15:26.134,Do you understand?
00:15:27.260,00:15:29.512,I'll assemble them in the common room after dinner.
00:15:30.596,00:15:34.475,"If you have any further questions, feel free to join the deputy warden in the search."
00:15:49.323,00:15:50.366,and the water's freezing.
00:15:51.117,00:15:53.411,"Current was strong last night, tide pushing in."
00:15:54.245,00:15:57.707,"She'd have drowned or been crushed on the rocks, and her body would have washed back up on shore."
00:16:02.128,00:16:04.213,What about those caves down there? Have you checked them?
00:16:05.298,00:16:06.632,No way she could get there.
00:16:07.800,00:16:14.432,"The bases of those cliffs are covered in poison ivy, live oak, sumac, a thousand plants with thorns as big as my dick."
00:16:15.516,00:16:17.685,"You said yourself, Marshal, she's got no shoes."
00:16:23.983,00:16:26.569,"All right, let's check the other side."
00:16:32.158,00:16:34.744,-What's that tower? -It's an old lighthouse.
00:16:35.786,00:16:37.497,The guards already searched inside it.
00:16:40.416,00:16:41.876,What's in there? More patients?
00:16:42.752,00:16:44.128,Sewage treatment facility.
00:16:45.296,00:16:48.549,It's getting dark soon. I'm calling this off for tonight.
00:16:49.342,00:16:50.343,"Let's go, boys!"
00:16:56.724,00:17:01.395,"Yeah, couldn't nobody get in or out of their room on that corridor without me seeing."
00:17:02.021,00:17:06.776,"Okay, Rachel Solando, who else does she have to pass to get down here?"
00:17:13.032,00:17:15.660,Me. Glen Miga.
00:17:16.911,00:17:18.079,"Sir, I didn't see nothing."
00:17:18.454,00:17:20.206,"Yeah, and you were at your post all night?"
00:17:21.040,00:17:22.583,"Yeah, but I didn't see a thing."
00:17:25.336,00:17:26.337,Glen.
00:17:28.339,00:17:29.340,Glen.
00:17:32.218,00:17:33.302,Tell me the truth.
00:17:35.137,00:17:40.518,I… I maybe went to the bathroom.
00:17:41.227,00:17:45.147,-What? You breached protocol. Christ. -I wasn't gone more than a minute.
00:17:46.357,00:17:49.193,"All right, look. Let's back up here. Let's all just back up."
00:17:49.485,00:17:52.196,Miss Solando was put in her room for lights out.
00:17:52.947,00:17:54.657,Does anyone here know what she did before that?
00:17:56.450,00:17:57.451,Anyone?
00:18:01.831,00:18:03.374,She was in a group therapy session.
00:18:04.166,00:18:05.167,Huh.
00:18:05.668,00:18:07.044,Anything unusual occur?
00:18:08.129,00:18:09.589,Define unusual.
00:18:10.631,00:18:15.219,"-Excuse me? -This is a mental institution, Marshal, for the criminally insane."
00:18:19.890,00:18:21.017,I will rephrase.
00:18:21.642,00:18:29.567,"Did anything happen last night during group therapy that was more, let's say, I don't know, memorable than-- -Normal? -Exactly."
00:18:30.735,00:18:31.944,No. Sorry.
00:18:32.862,00:18:35.573,Did Miss Solando say anything during group therapy?
00:18:37.116,00:18:38.409,She was worried about the rain.
00:18:40.369,00:18:41.537,And she hated the food here.
00:18:43.956,00:18:45.082,last night included.
00:18:47.126,00:18:49.503,So you were there. Was there a doctor present?
00:18:51.005,00:18:53.132,"Yes, Dr. Sheehan led the discussion."
00:18:54.675,00:18:55.676,Dr. Sheehan?
00:18:56.802,00:18:59.347,"Yes, he was running the session."
00:19:00.681,00:19:04.143,"He's Rachel's primary, the psychiatrist who directly oversees her care."
00:19:04.685,00:19:05.686,Huh.
00:19:07.229,00:19:08.981,We're gonna need to speak with Dr. Sheehan.
00:19:09.523,00:19:13.694,I'm afraid that won't be possible. He left on the ferry this morning.
00:19:14.153,00:19:17.114,His vacation was already planned. He'd been putting it off too long.
00:19:17.531,00:19:26.499,"You're in a state of lockdown, a dangerous patient has escaped, and you let her primary doctor leave on vacation?"
00:19:27.416,00:19:28.918,"Well, of course. He's a doctor."
00:19:33.798,00:19:36.300,Do you have the phone number for where he's gone?
00:19:37.510,00:19:39.428,Hello? Hello?
00:19:41.305,00:19:42.306,Hello?
00:19:43.724,00:19:44.725,Anybody there?
00:19:45.851,00:19:47.937,"I'm sorry, sir, but it's all down. All the lines."
00:19:48.104,00:19:49.563,The storm's hitting the mainland like a hammer.
00:19:49.939,00:19:52.024,"If you get it working, come find me immediately."
00:19:52.108,00:19:53.984,The Marshals need to make an important call.
00:19:54.568,00:19:55.569,"Yes, sir."
00:20:04.328,00:20:09.333,"but I'll be having drinks and a cigar at my house around nine, if you'd care to drop by."
00:20:10.126,00:20:12.169,"Good. We can talk then, right?"
00:20:14.547,00:20:16.215,"We have been talking, Marshal."
00:20:33.441,00:20:36.444,"Gotta say, I'm thinking I got in the wrong line of public service."
00:20:36.736,00:20:42.742,"It is a little overwhelming. It was constructed during the Civil War, the same time as the military fort housing Ward C."
00:20:50.750,00:20:52.877,This is the original commander's quarters.
00:20:52.960,00:20:56.255,"When Uncle Sam got the bill, the commander was court-martialed."
00:20:56.464,00:20:57.548,I can see why.
00:20:58.758,00:21:01.260,Nice music. Who is that? Brahms?
00:21:02.219,00:21:03.220,No.
00:21:28.245,00:21:31.123,Quartet for Piano and Strings in A minor.
00:21:34.794,00:21:35.795,"Your poison, gentlemen?"
00:21:36.378,00:21:39.089,"-Rye, if you got it. -Soda and ice, please. Thanks."
00:21:40.508,00:21:43.969,You don't indulge in alcohol? I'm surprised.
00:21:45.721,00:21:48.474,Isn't it common for men in your profession to imbibe?
00:21:49.517,00:21:52.311,"Common enough. And, in yours?"
00:21:54.063,00:21:55.064,I'm sorry?
00:21:55.272,00:21:57.942,"-Your profession, Doctor. Psychiatry. -Yes."
00:21:58.067,00:22:00.861,I always heard it was overrun with boozers and drunks.
00:22:02.655,00:22:03.781,Not that I've noticed.
00:22:05.491,00:22:07.331,"What's that? Iced tea in your glass, there?"
00:22:10.913,00:22:13.165,You have outstanding defense mechanisms.
00:22:14.291,00:22:16.377,You must be quite adept at interrogations.
00:22:17.628,00:22:18.629,Hmm.
00:22:26.095,00:22:29.431,"Men like you are my specialty, you know?"
00:22:30.266,00:22:31.684,Men of violence.
00:22:32.017,00:22:33.853,Now that's a hell of an assumption to make.
00:22:34.019,00:22:35.604,"No assumption. No, not at all."
00:22:35.729,00:22:39.567,You misunderstand me. I said you are men of violence.
00:22:39.817,00:22:42.695,I'm not accusing you of being violent men.
00:22:43.153,00:22:46.699,"-That's quite different. -No, please. Please. Edify us, Doctor."
00:22:49.743,00:22:51.245,"You both served overseas, huh?"
00:22:51.704,00:22:55.708,"It's not much of a stretch, Doc. For all you know, we were both paper pushers over there."
00:22:56.542,00:22:58.043,"No, you were not."
00:23:14.351,00:23:19.315,"Since the schoolyard, neither of you has ever… walked away from a physical conflict."
00:23:19.440,00:23:24.820,"No, no, not because you enjoy it, but because retreat isn't something you consider an option."
00:23:25.905,00:23:27.448,"We weren't raised to run, Doc."
00:23:28.032,00:23:30.743,Ahh. Yes. Raised.
00:23:32.870,00:23:34.872,"And who raised you, Marshal?"
00:23:35.623,00:23:36.624,Me?
00:23:43.005,00:23:45.090,Very impressive defense mechanisms.
00:24:52.741,00:24:53.784,"No, I'm quite serious."
00:24:56.662,00:24:57.871,Das glaube ich.
00:25:00.374,00:25:02.960,"You ever seen a death camp, Doctor?"
00:25:18.434,00:25:22.563,"His English really is very good. You hit the consonants a tad hard, though."
00:25:24.398,00:25:25.399,You're a German?
00:25:26.984,00:25:31.196,"-Is legal immigration a crime, Marshal? -Oh, I don't know, Doctor. You tell us."
00:25:34.074,00:25:35.075,"Now, listen."
00:25:35.367,00:25:38.704,"We're gonna need those files on Sheehan, and the rest of the staff as well."
00:25:39.288,00:25:41.999,"No personnel files will be released to you, period."
00:25:42.458,00:25:45.252,-We're gonna need those files. -Out of the question.
00:25:48.422,00:25:50.299,"Just who the hell's in charge here, anyway, huh?"
00:25:53.385,00:26:00.517,"to our Board of Overseers. He relayed your request, They don't have the authority to refuse, and neither do you, sir."
00:26:00.642,00:26:04.104,"Marshal, continue your investigation and we'll do all we can to help."
00:26:04.271,00:26:05.773,This investigation is over.
00:26:06.065,00:26:10.444,We're gonna file our reports and we're gonna hand it over to… -Hoover's boys. -Hoover's boys. That's right.
00:26:11.070,00:26:12.613,We'll be taking the ferry back in the morning.
00:26:13.322,00:26:14.364,"Come on, Chuck."
00:26:47.481,00:26:48.774,We really packing it in?
00:26:50.317,00:26:51.318,Why?
00:26:52.194,00:26:55.489,"I guess, I don't know, I just never really quit anything before."
00:26:56.698,00:26:59.159,"We haven't heard the truth once yet, Chuck."
00:27:00.285,00:27:05.082,"Listen, Rachel Solando didn't slip out of a locked cell, barefoot, without any help."
00:27:06.416,00:27:07.835,I think she had a lot of help.
00:27:09.002,00:27:13.590,Maybe Cawley's sitting up in his mansion right now rethinking his whole attitude.
00:27:15.050,00:27:16.885,"-Maybe, in the morning, we'll be-- -You're bluffing?"
00:27:19.012,00:27:20.139,I didn't say that.
00:27:39.116,00:27:40.868,"I found a whole stack of these, Teddy."
00:27:42.536,00:27:44.204,"Jesus, are you ever sober anymore?"
00:27:46.290,00:27:48.083,I killed a lot of people in the war.
00:27:50.502,00:27:51.628,Is that why you drink?
00:27:55.090,00:27:56.133,Are you real?
00:27:57.843,00:27:58.844,No.
00:28:02.806,00:28:03.891,She's still here.
00:28:05.225,00:28:06.226,Who?
00:28:07.644,00:28:08.645,Rachel?
00:28:10.272,00:28:11.315,She never left.
00:28:25.579,00:28:28.290,"Remember when we stayed in the cabin in the summer, Teddy?"
00:28:30.167,00:28:31.293,We were so happy.
00:28:34.171,00:28:35.172,She's here.
00:28:36.215,00:28:37.299,You can't leave.
00:28:50.687,00:28:51.855,I'm not gonna leave.
00:28:53.607,00:28:55.275,I love you so much.
00:28:59.905,00:29:01.865,"I'm just bones in a box, Teddy."
00:29:02.574,00:29:03.575,No.
00:29:05.410,00:29:06.411,I am.
00:29:09.831,00:29:11.333,You have to wake up.
00:29:16.046,00:29:17.047,You're here.
00:29:19.341,00:29:22.928,I'm not. You have to face that.
00:29:26.348,00:29:27.432,But she is.
00:29:30.102,00:29:31.103,So is he.
00:29:33.522,00:29:34.523,Who?
00:29:37.359,00:29:38.360,Laeddis.
00:29:43.073,00:29:45.200,-I have to go. -No.
00:29:46.159,00:29:49.997,"No, please. Please. I need to hold on to you."
00:29:50.789,00:29:52.833,"-Just a little bit longer, please. -Oh, God, Teddy."
00:29:53.333,00:29:54.918,You have to let me go.
00:29:57.004,00:29:58.005,I can't.
00:30:30.245,00:30:31.997,Ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit.
00:30:37.252,00:30:38.253,Doctor!
00:30:39.087,00:30:40.255,"Doctor, Doctor."
00:30:40.922,00:30:43.800,We need to interview the patients who were in Rachel's group therapy session.
00:30:43.925,00:30:45.719,I thought your investigation was finished.
00:30:46.011,00:30:47.804,"Well, it's not like we could take the ferry."
00:30:48.972,00:30:51.808,"Now, was Rachel receiving any other treatments for her illnesses?"
00:30:53.477,00:30:58.857,"Do you know the state of the mental health field -these days, gentlemen? -No, not a clue, Doctor."
00:30:59.483,00:31:00.484,War.
00:31:00.901,00:31:03.236,The old school believes in surgical intervention.
00:31:03.820,00:31:04.821,Psychosurgery.
00:31:05.322,00:31:07.949,Procedures like the transorbital lobotomy.
00:31:09.451,00:31:12.204,"Some say the patients become reasonable, docile."
00:31:12.913,00:31:14.414,Others say they become zombies.
00:31:15.040,00:31:17.376,-And the new school? -Psychopharmacology.
00:31:17.459,00:31:22.672,"A new drug has just been approved called Thorazine, which relaxes psychotic patients, you could say tames them."
00:31:22.964,00:31:24.925,"-And which school are you, Doctor? -Me?"
00:31:25.592,00:31:33.308,"I have this radical idea that if you treat a patient with respect, listen to him, try, and understand, you just might reach him."
00:31:36.019,00:31:37.562,"Come on, Marge. It's okay."
00:31:39.898,00:31:41.817,"-These patients, huh? -Even these."
00:31:42.067,00:31:44.569,What should be a last resort is becoming a first response.
00:31:44.653,00:31:47.114,"Give them a pill, put them in a corner, it all goes away."
00:31:48.573,00:31:55.122,"Rachel Solando was on a combination of drugs meant to keep her from becoming violent, but it was only intermittently effective."
00:31:56.081,00:31:59.918,The greatest obstacle to her recovery was her refusal to face what she had done.
00:32:01.461,00:32:02.462,Was.
00:32:03.130,00:32:07.175,"Is-- is there a reason you keep referring to your patient in the past tense, doctor?"
00:32:10.804,00:32:12.222,"Look outside, Marshal."
00:32:13.473,00:32:14.558,Why do you think?
00:32:21.273,00:32:23.024,Next up is Peter Breene.
00:32:23.108,00:32:25.360,Assaulted his father's nurse with broken glass.
00:32:25.444,00:32:28.071,"Nurse survived, but her face was permanently disfigured."
00:32:29.114,00:32:30.115,I can't wait.
00:32:30.532,00:32:33.368,She'd smile at me. She was so sweet.
00:32:33.869,00:32:36.079,But you could see it in her eyes.
00:32:36.830,00:32:39.791,"She liked to be naked, to suck cock."
00:32:41.585,00:32:42.836,"Okay, Mr. Breene."
00:32:44.045,00:32:46.631,And then she asked me if she can have a glass of water?
00:32:47.424,00:32:50.302,"Alone, in the kitchen, like that's no big deal?"
00:32:51.595,00:32:54.181,"-Well, why was that a big deal? -It was obvious."
00:32:54.848,00:32:58.935,She wanted me to pull out my thing so that she could laugh at it.
00:33:01.104,00:33:06.234,"Mr. Breene… we need to ask you some questions, okay?"
00:33:08.862,00:33:10.238,"When I cut her, she screamed."
00:33:13.074,00:33:15.702,But… she scared me.
00:33:21.166,00:33:24.586,"But we're here to talk about Rachel Solando, okay?"
00:33:24.753,00:33:28.715,Rachel Solando. Do you-- you know that she drowned her own kids?
00:33:29.174,00:33:31.009,She drowned her kids!
00:33:31.468,00:33:34.554,"This is-- this is a sick fucking world we live in, I'll tell you that."
00:33:34.638,00:33:36.056,But you know what? They should be gassed.
00:33:36.348,00:33:40.644,"All of them, the-- the retards, the killers, the niggers."
00:33:40.810,00:33:43.355,"You kill your own kid, gas the bitch."
00:33:46.858,00:33:48.193,Could you… stop that?
00:33:52.572,00:33:54.908,"That nurse, maybe, maybe she had kids, huh?"
00:33:57.494,00:33:58.495,A husband.
00:34:00.205,00:34:02.165,Just trying to make ends meet.
00:34:03.875,00:34:06.044,Lead a-- a normal life.
00:34:07.087,00:34:13.009,"And it says in your file that… you tore her face off, didn't you?"
00:34:14.427,00:34:17.931,Congratulations. No more normal for her. Not ever again. No.
00:34:20.183,00:34:22.811,Do you know what she was afraid of?
00:34:25.647,00:34:28.650,"-You. -Could you stop that, please?"
00:34:31.027,00:34:32.028,Stop that!
00:34:33.321,00:34:34.698,Please! Stop!
00:34:34.781,00:34:36.449,Do you know a patient named Andrew Laeddis?
00:34:36.616,00:34:38.076,-Do you? -No! No.
00:34:38.326,00:34:40.370,-Boss. What's up? -Fine.
00:34:40.495,00:34:42.956,-I wanna go back. I wanna go. -Peter! Come on!
00:34:43.123,00:34:46.084,"-I got him. Peter! Peter! -Hey, Peter!"
00:34:46.251,00:34:47.252,Go back.
00:34:59.389,00:35:02.976,I'll never get out of here. I'm not sure that I should.
00:35:04.686,00:35:07.355,"Excuse me for saying this, Miss Kearns."
00:35:07.439,00:35:10.066,-Mrs. -Mrs. Kearns.
00:35:11.901,00:35:14.654,But you seem quite… quite normal.
00:35:14.779,00:35:17.032,"I mean, in-- in comparison to the other patients here."
00:35:18.074,00:35:21.703,"Well, I have my dark days. I suppose everybody does."
00:35:22.954,00:35:26.166,The difference is most people don't kill their husbands with an axe.
00:35:27.375,00:35:28.376,Ah.
00:35:28.585,00:35:39.638,"Although, personally, I think if a man beats you and fucks half the women he sees, and no one will help you, axing him isn't the least understandable thing you could do."
00:35:45.185,00:35:46.811,What would I do if I did?
00:35:49.689,00:35:54.069,They say there are bombs that can reduce whole cities to ash.
00:35:54.444,00:35:59.741,"And what do you call them? Televisions, voices and faces coming from a box."
00:36:00.784,00:36:02.535,I hear enough voices already.
00:36:03.995,00:36:05.747,What can you tell us about Rachel?
00:36:07.832,00:36:12.087,Umm… Not much. She-- she keeps to herself.
00:36:12.379,00:36:15.632,She believed her kids were alive.
00:36:16.549,00:36:25.100,"She thought she was still living in the Berkshires, and we were all her neighbors, the-- the milkmen, -postmen-- -Deliverymen."
00:36:26.643,00:36:28.103,And Dr. Sheehan was there that night?
00:36:29.312,00:36:32.982,Yes. Umm… he talked about anger.
00:36:35.694,00:36:38.488,Tell me about him. What's he like?
00:36:41.032,00:36:46.037,Ah… he's… okay. Nice.
00:36:48.123,00:36:50.583,"Not hard on the eyes, as my mother would say."
00:36:53.503,00:36:55.046,Did he ever make a pass at you?
00:36:56.297,00:36:57.298,No.
00:36:57.966,00:37:03.722,"No, Dr. Sheehan's a good doctor, he would never… Umm."
00:37:04.639,00:37:06.641,"Could I-- could I have a glass of water, please?"
00:37:06.933,00:37:07.934,No problem.
00:37:36.004,00:37:38.256,Did you ever meet a patient named Andrew Laeddis?
00:37:42.427,00:37:43.428,No.
00:37:54.230,00:38:08.036,"She used practically the same words as Cawley and the nurse, You asked every one of those patients back there about him. Who is he?"
00:38:13.124,00:38:15.960,"What the hell, boss? I'm your partner, for Christ's sake."
00:38:16.586,00:38:17.796,"We just met, Chuck."
00:38:19.047,00:38:22.550,You've been on the beat for a long time. You've got a duty. You've got a career.
00:38:22.634,00:38:27.013,What I'm doing… it's not exactly by the book.
00:38:28.473,00:38:31.267,"I don't-- I don't give a damn about by-the-book, boss."
00:38:31.351,00:38:33.353,I just wanna know what the hell's going on.
00:38:38.399,00:38:44.572,"When this case came over the wires, I requested it specifically, you understand?"
00:38:45.365,00:38:46.366,Why?
00:38:48.910,00:38:55.083,Andrew Laeddis… he was the maintenance man in the apartment building where my wife and I lived.
00:38:56.876,00:38:57.877,Okay.
00:38:59.921,00:39:01.548,He was also a firebug.
00:39:04.759,00:39:12.559,Andrew Laeddis lit the match… that caused the fire that killed my wife.
00:39:28.783,00:39:31.202,Laeddis got away with it and then he disappeared.
00:39:31.286,00:39:34.080,"About a year ago, I open up the paper and there he is."
00:39:34.497,00:39:36.040,Ugly-looking son of a bitch.
00:39:36.332,00:39:39.002,Huge scar from his right temple down to his left lip.
00:39:39.085,00:39:42.297,Eyes different colors. Not the type of face you'd forget.
00:39:42.547,00:39:47.427,"He burned down a schoolhouse, killed two people, said voices told him to do it."
00:39:47.594,00:39:50.221,"First, he went to prison, then he got transferred here."
00:39:50.346,00:39:52.140,-Then what? -Then nothing.
00:39:52.640,00:39:56.102,He vanished like he never existed. No record whatsoever.
00:39:56.394,00:39:57.979,Pretty sure he's not in Ward B.
00:39:58.104,00:40:00.148,-That leaves Ward C. -Or he could be dead.
00:40:00.398,00:40:02.567,"So could Rachel Solando, for that matter."
00:40:02.942,00:40:05.069,Lot of places to hide a body here.
00:40:06.404,00:40:08.865,Only one place no one would really notice.
00:40:20.793,00:40:27.175,"That patient, Bridget Kearns, when she sent me for water, she said something to you back there, didn't she?"
00:40:28.051,00:40:29.052,No.
00:40:31.095,00:40:32.138,"Come on, boss."
00:40:36.309,00:40:37.310,She wrote it.
00:40:53.284,00:40:55.995,Boss! We gotta get indoors.
00:40:56.120,00:40:58.289,It's turning into a fucking Kansas out here.
00:41:03.461,00:41:04.462,Watch out!
00:41:07.048,00:41:08.049,Jesus!
00:41:20.728,00:41:21.729,Boss!
00:41:42.959,00:41:46.129,"-You okay, boss? -Yeah, I'm all right."
00:41:53.177,00:41:57.390,"So if Laeddis is here, what are you gonna do about it?"
00:42:00.435,00:42:01.936,I'm not here to kill Laeddis.
00:42:10.570,00:42:12.822,"If it was my wife, I'd kill him. Twice."
00:42:37.346,00:42:44.812,"The Kommandant tried to kill himself before we got there, but… he-- he botched it."
00:42:46.981,00:42:48.357,Took him an hour to die.
00:42:53.988,00:42:57.492,"When I went outside, I saw all the bodies on the ground."
00:43:02.205,00:43:03.247,Too many to count.
00:43:30.650,00:43:32.026,Too many to imagine.
00:43:35.154,00:43:41.994,"So, yeah, the… the guards surrendered. We took their guns and we lined them up."
00:44:27.081,00:44:32.295,It wasn't warfare. It was… it was murder.
00:44:36.340,00:44:38.759,"Yeah, and I've-- I've had enough of killing."
00:44:41.679,00:44:42.847,That's not why I'm here.
00:44:44.807,00:44:46.267,So what is this all about?
00:44:48.853,00:44:54.567,After Laeddis vanished… I started doing some checking on Ashecliffe.
00:44:56.277,00:44:59.697,"A lot of people know about this place, but no one wants to talk, you know?"
00:44:59.822,00:45:02.867,It's like… it's like they're scared or something.
00:45:05.328,00:45:11.667,"You know, this place is funded by a special grant… from The House Un-American Activities Committee?"
00:45:12.293,00:45:17.256,HUAC? And how exactly are we fighting the communists from an island in Boston Harbor?
00:45:18.466,00:45:20.927,By conducting experiments on the mind.
00:45:22.553,00:45:25.806,"-At least, that's my guess. -And you think that's going on here?"
00:45:25.973,00:45:27.850,"Like I said, no one would talk, right?"
00:45:28.476,00:45:30.686,Till I found somebody who used to be a patient here.
00:45:31.312,00:45:35.233,Guy's name is George Noyce. Nice college kid. Socialist.
00:45:35.733,00:45:37.735,He gets offered some money to do a psych study.
00:45:37.860,00:45:40.238,-Guess what they were testing? -Toothpaste.
00:45:40.488,00:45:42.698,"So, he starts seeing dragons everywhere."
00:45:42.865,00:45:47.870,"He almost beats his professor to death. Ends up here in Ashecliffe, Ward C."
00:45:48.621,00:45:51.958,"They release him after one year, right? And what does he do?"
00:45:52.166,00:46:04.720,"Two weeks on the mainland, he walks into a bar… His lawyer pleads insanity. But Noyce-- Noyce, he stands up in the courtroom and he-- he begs the judge for the electric chair."
00:46:04.804,00:46:06.555,Anywhere but a mental hospital.
00:46:07.723,00:46:09.850,Judge gives him life in Dedham Prison.
00:46:11.352,00:46:13.354,"-And you found him. -Yeah, I found him."
00:46:14.230,00:46:16.607,"Well, he's… he's a mess."
00:46:18.401,00:46:20.278,But it's pretty clear from what he tells me.
00:46:20.569,00:46:23.572,-What? -They're experimenting on people here.
00:46:24.532,00:46:25.616,"I don't know, boss."
00:46:27.493,00:46:30.621,"-How do you believe a crazy guy? -That's the beauty of it, isn't it?"
00:46:30.871,00:46:32.623,"Crazy people, they're the perfect subjects."
00:46:32.790,00:46:34.667,"They talk, nobody listens."
00:46:35.793,00:46:36.919,I stood at Dachau.
00:46:37.670,00:46:41.549,"We-- we saw what human beings are capable of doing to each other, right?"
00:46:42.425,00:46:47.346,"For Christ's sakes, we fought a goddamn war to stop them, and now-- now I find out it may be happening here?"
00:46:47.638,00:46:49.307,On our soil? No.
00:46:51.183,00:46:53.060,"So, what are you really here to do, Ted?"
00:46:54.520,00:47:01.902,"I'm gonna get the proof, I'm gonna go back, and I'm gonna blow the lid off this place. That's it."
00:47:03.404,00:47:04.447,Wait a minute.
00:47:05.573,00:47:11.912,"You started asking around about Ashecliffe, waiting for a chance to get out here, and then, suddenly, they need a U.S. Marshal?"
00:47:12.580,00:47:13.581,Yeah.
00:47:13.748,00:47:15.499,I got lucky. There was a patient escape.
00:47:15.583,00:47:17.501,"-It was the perfect excuse. -No, no, no, boss."
00:47:17.585,00:47:18.961,Luck doesn't work that way.
00:47:19.628,00:47:21.339,The world doesn't work that way.
00:47:21.422,00:47:24.550,They got an electrified fence around a septic facility.
00:47:24.800,00:47:27.470,Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?
00:47:28.054,00:47:31.766,A Chief of Staff with ties to the OSS? Funding from HUAC?
00:47:31.849,00:47:33.225,"I mean, Jesus Christ."
00:47:33.434,00:47:36.354,Everything about this place stinks of government ops.
00:47:36.437,00:47:37.772,What if they wanted you here?
00:47:37.897,00:47:39.774,-Bullshit. -You were asking questions.
00:47:39.857,00:47:40.858,-Bullshit! Bullshit! -Bullshit.
00:47:40.983,00:47:42.276,We came here for Rachel Solando.
00:47:42.360,00:47:44.653,Where-- where's one shred of evidence she even existed?
00:47:45.196,00:47:47.656,There's no way they could've known I'd be assigned to this case.
00:47:47.740,00:47:50.743,"-There's no way. -What if while you were looking into them, they were looking into you?"
00:47:51.452,00:47:54.580,All they had to do was fake an escape to get you here and now they have you.
00:47:54.663,00:47:56.582,Now they have us both. Here! Now!
00:48:03.172,00:48:04.757,This is Deputy Warden McPherson.
00:48:06.217,00:48:09.303,"-Marshals! -How about that? They found us, huh?"
00:48:09.387,00:48:11.972,"It's an island, boss. They're always gonna find us."
00:48:16.477,00:48:20.022,We're getting off this goddamn island. You and me. Come on!
00:48:24.318,00:48:25.611,"-Come on! -Go, go!"
00:48:39.834,00:48:42.837,And hurry up! This thing is turning into a goddamn hurricane!
00:48:48.342,00:48:52.012,I dropped those suits off to be cleaned. They should be ready by tomorrow.
00:48:52.763,00:48:54.473,That is if we all don't wash away first.
00:48:55.683,00:48:59.812,"You know, speaking of which, I'm afraid your smokes are pretty much done for."
00:49:00.688,00:49:04.900,"So… This is our only choice, huh?"
00:49:05.693,00:49:08.571,Got something really nice in a prison gray if that don't work for you.
00:49:08.946,00:49:11.198,"Now that you mention it, these are just fine."
00:49:12.533,00:49:17.204,That's why I must repeat my insistence that all Ward C patients be placed in manual restraints.
00:49:18.038,00:49:21.208,"If the facility floods, they'll drown. You know that."
00:49:21.834,00:49:23.043,That would take a lot of flooding.
00:49:25.129,00:49:28.549,during a hurricane. A lot of flooding seems like a distinct possibility.
00:49:31.177,00:49:32.344,There's a backup generator.
00:49:32.428,00:49:35.139,"And if that goes, the cell doors will open."
00:49:36.599,00:49:37.850,Where are they going to go?
00:49:39.018,00:49:42.062,"They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over to the mainland and wreak havoc."
00:49:43.314,00:49:46.233,They're far more likely to wreak havoc right here on us.
00:49:47.234,00:49:49.069,"If they're manacled to the floor, they'll die."
00:49:50.446,00:49:51.989,This is 24 human beings.
00:49:52.823,00:49:54.450,"And you can live with that, can you?"
00:49:56.619,00:49:59.955,I'd put all 42 in Wards A and B in manual restraints as well.
00:50:02.958,00:50:05.586,"I-- I'm sorry, doctor. I just have one quick question."
00:50:05.669,00:50:11.717,"-Yes, I'll be with you in a moment. -When we spoke this morning about Rachel Solando's note… The law of four. I love that."
00:50:11.800,00:50:15.554,"You said you had no idea what that second line could refer to, correct?"
00:50:16.472,00:50:19.808,"Who is 67? Yes, I'm afraid I still don't."
00:50:22.269,00:50:23.354,Nothing comes to mind?
00:50:26.190,00:50:27.191,Nothing?
00:50:31.445,00:50:42.540,"Because I believe I just heard you say there are 24 patients in Ward C, and 42 patients in Wards A and B, which means there's a total of, what, 66 patients at this facility?"
00:50:44.124,00:50:45.292,"That is correct, yes."
00:50:48.629,00:50:55.010,"Well, it seems to me Rachel Solando was suggesting that you have a 67th patient, doctor."
00:50:56.512,00:50:57.680,But I'm afraid we don't.
00:50:58.639,00:51:00.516,This is ridiculous. What are they doing here?
00:51:00.641,00:51:02.351,We're doing our goddamn job.
00:51:03.102,00:51:05.271,Didn't McPherson tell you the good news?
00:51:06.897,00:51:08.357,"No. What's the good news, doctor?"
00:51:09.441,00:51:10.568,Rachel's been found.
00:51:12.236,00:51:13.237,She's here.
00:51:14.780,00:51:15.781,Safe and sound.
00:51:28.002,00:51:29.253,There's not a mark on her.
00:51:33.507,00:51:34.592,Who are these men?
00:51:38.387,00:51:39.763,Why are they in my house?
00:51:40.055,00:51:44.435,"Police officers, Rachel. They… have a few questions."
00:51:48.147,00:51:58.907,"Ma'am… there has been a sighting of a known communist… subversive in this area, passing out literature."
00:52:01.076,00:52:02.077,Here?
00:52:04.413,00:52:05.497,In this neighborhood?
00:52:06.123,00:52:07.541,"Yes, I'm afraid so."
00:52:09.335,00:52:15.132,"Now if you could tell us what you did yesterday, where you were, it would really help us narrow down our search."
00:52:16.759,00:52:27.102,"Yes. Um… Well, I… I made breakfast for Jim and the children."
00:52:29.521,00:52:34.777,"And then, I… packed Jim's lunch and he left."
00:52:38.614,00:52:40.741,"Then, I sent the children off to school."
00:52:45.746,00:52:56.256,And then… I decided to take a long swim in the lake.
00:53:03.514,00:53:04.515,I see.
00:53:08.602,00:53:09.603,And after that?
00:53:17.986,00:53:30.249,After that… I thought of you.
00:53:36.880,00:53:40.801,"I'm-- I'm sorry, ma'am. I-- I don't know what you're talking about."
00:53:43.846,00:53:46.432,"Don't you know how lonely I've been, Jim?"
00:53:52.646,00:53:53.647,You're gone.
00:53:57.985,00:53:58.986,You're dead.
00:54:04.491,00:54:06.076,I cry every night.
00:54:12.166,00:54:14.251,How am I supposed to survive?
00:54:27.723,00:54:30.768,"Rachel, it'll be all right."
00:54:34.188,00:54:40.569,"I'm so sorry, but every… everything's gonna be all right. Okay?"
00:54:42.696,00:54:43.822,I buried you.
00:54:46.533,00:54:52.790,"I buried an empty casket. Your body rained down lumps of flesh splashing into the sea, eaten by sharks."
00:54:56.960,00:54:59.254,"My Jim's dead, so who the fuck are you?"
00:55:03.050,00:55:04.635,Who the fuck are you?
00:55:06.637,00:55:08.013,-Who are you? -It's okay. Rachel. It is okay.
00:55:17.898,00:55:20.859,I'm sorry about that. I-- I didn't want to interrupt.
00:55:20.943,00:55:26.949,"I thought she might tell you something. But, we found her down by the lighthouse, skipping stones."
00:55:27.324,00:55:32.120,"We've no idea how she got out, but, I'm gonna have to ask you to go down into the basement."
00:55:32.204,00:55:33.997,"There's food, water, and cots."
00:55:34.081,00:55:37.209,"It's the safest place to be, when the hurricane hits."
00:55:41.630,00:55:43.173,Are you all right? You look pale.
00:55:43.799,00:55:52.182,"I'm fine. It's just… It's just so, so goddamn bright, isn't it?"
00:55:52.432,00:55:54.643,"Photosensitivity, headaches, sometimes."
00:56:06.405,00:56:10.993,"Take these, Marshal. Couple of hours, He's having a migraine."
00:56:11.076,00:56:15.914,"Imagine someone sawed open your head, filled it with razors, and shook it as hard as they could. Take the pills, Marshal."
00:56:16.164,00:56:18.292,-I don't-- I don't want the pills. -It'll stop the pain.
00:56:18.375,00:56:20.085,"Marshal, take the pills."
00:56:24.214,00:56:25.632,He's going to need to lie down.
00:56:32.055,00:56:32.973,"Oh, God."
00:56:34.597,00:56:36.101,-Make sure the meds are locked up. -Watch your back.
00:56:52.117,00:56:54.202,Could be worse right now. He'll be all right.
00:57:00.751,00:57:01.752,Who is that?
00:57:07.507,00:57:09.092,"Don't you worry about him, all right?"
00:57:09.760,00:57:11.678,Come on. Lay back. Lay back.
00:57:15.974,00:57:19.186,"He looks like an ex-military prick, huh?"
00:57:19.269,00:57:21.313,"Well, you know what? I ain't gonna argue with you on that one."
00:58:52.029,00:58:54.156,You should have saved all of us.
00:59:23.310,00:59:25.103,"Hey, buddy."
00:59:27.355,00:59:29.566,-Hey. -Laeddis.
00:59:31.693,00:59:32.694,Yeah.
00:59:38.075,00:59:44.664,My… my buddy.
00:59:46.208,00:59:47.334,"No hard feelings, right?"
00:59:52.172,00:59:53.173,Yeah.
00:59:54.758,00:59:55.842,No hard feelings.
01:00:09.815,01:00:11.233,A little something for later.
01:00:15.654,01:00:17.864,'Cause I know how much you need it.
01:00:24.287,01:00:25.831,"The clock's ticking, my friend."
01:00:26.998,01:00:28.250,We're running out of time.
01:00:39.261,01:00:40.345,Give me a hand here.
01:01:03.326,01:01:04.911,I could get into trouble.
01:01:33.231,01:01:34.232,I'm dead.
01:01:37.611,01:01:38.904,I'm so sorry.
01:01:40.697,01:01:42.365,Why didn't you save me?
01:01:43.783,01:01:49.331,"I tried. I-- I wanted to. But by the time I got there, it was too late."
01:02:11.519,01:02:12.520,See?
01:02:15.899,01:02:17.108,Aren't they beautiful?
01:03:12.372,01:03:14.416,"Why are you all wet, baby?"
01:03:17.294,01:03:18.378,Laeddis isn't dead.
01:03:20.380,01:03:21.381,He isn't gone.
01:03:23.133,01:03:24.134,He's still here.
01:03:26.970,01:03:27.971,I know.
01:03:29.055,01:03:30.307,"You need to find him, Teddy."
01:03:31.224,01:03:33.310,"You need to find him, and you kill him dead."
01:03:51.328,01:03:52.370,It's okay.
01:03:59.753,01:04:01.171,Shhh.
01:04:11.598,01:04:12.974,"You okay, boss?"
01:04:15.852,01:04:17.228,This goddamn migraine.
01:04:17.979,01:04:21.608,The backup generator's failed. The whole place has gone crazy.
01:04:23.485,01:04:24.486,What do you want to do?
01:04:34.204,01:04:36.664,You don't wanna do that. Put it down. Now. Put it down.
01:04:36.748,01:04:39.376,"Grab him, grab him, grab him, grab him! Get him, get him!"
01:04:47.467,01:04:49.469,You think the whole electrical system is fried?
01:04:50.220,01:04:52.222,"I'd say it's a good possibility, yeah."
01:04:52.972,01:04:54.682,All the electronic security.
01:04:57.102,01:04:58.103,the doors.
01:04:59.270,01:05:03.149,"Nice day for a stroll, don't you think? To Ward C, for example."
01:05:05.819,01:05:06.820,Come on.
01:05:16.996,01:05:19.457,He told me this is where they keep the worst ones.
01:05:19.791,01:05:21.835,Guys even the other inmates are scared of.
01:05:24.504,01:05:26.297,Did Noyce give you anything on the layout?
01:05:26.673,01:05:27.674,Not really.
01:05:28.133,01:05:33.221,"All he remembered was people screaming day and night, no windows and iron bars everywhere."
01:05:54.993,01:05:56.369,-Jesus Christ! -Jesus.
01:05:57.078,01:05:58.746,"First time on Ward C, huh?"
01:06:00.165,01:06:01.499,-Yeah. -Yeah. Yeah.
01:06:01.958,01:06:05.170,"-We heard stories, but-- -Trust me, son, you haven't heard shit."
01:06:06.171,01:06:10.341,"We got most of the bugsies locked down now, but some of them are still loose."
01:06:10.633,01:06:13.386,"And if you see one, don't try to restrain him yourselves."
01:06:13.470,01:06:15.722,These fuckers will kill you. Clear?
01:06:16.890,01:06:18.850,"All right, get your asses moving then. Go on."
01:07:16.658,01:07:17.659,He's here.
01:07:21.871,01:07:25.166,Laeddis. I can feel him.
01:07:29.629,01:07:30.964,Tag! You're it!
01:07:32.966,01:07:33.967,Ted!
01:07:42.976,01:07:44.602,Hey! Hey!
01:08:29.188,01:08:30.189,Listen to me.
01:08:31.733,01:08:34.360,"Listen, I don't wanna leave here, all right?"
01:08:35.111,01:08:36.821,"I mean, why would anybody want to?"
01:08:37.447,01:08:40.700,We hear things here about the outside world.
01:08:44.537,01:08:46.581,You know how a hydrogen bomb works?
01:08:46.664,01:08:49.834,-I know. With hydrogen! With hydrogen. -That's funny.
01:08:49.917,01:08:52.837,"-Boss! -Other bombs explode, right?"
01:08:55.381,01:09:00.678,"It implodes, creating an explosion to the thousandth, the millionth degree!"
01:09:01.262,01:09:02.889,-Do you get it? -Yeah! Yeah.
01:09:03.014,01:09:04.515,"-Do you? -I get it, I get it!"
01:09:23.242,01:09:24.243,What are you doing?
01:09:25.286,01:09:27.872,"Jesus Christ, Teddy. Jesus!"
01:09:28.373,01:09:31.918,You got Billings? What the fuck's the matter with you guys?
01:09:32.293,01:09:33.378,"Catch them, not kill them!"
01:09:36.464,01:09:38.675,We've gotta get him to the infirmary. Goddamn it.
01:09:38.966,01:09:42.553,"No, no! Not you, not you. Take a walk. Come on."
01:09:43.262,01:09:45.181,Cawley's gonna have my goddamn balls for this.
01:10:54.375,01:10:55.835,before I kill more.
01:10:58.004,01:11:00.339,Stop me before I kill more.
01:11:29.535,01:11:34.665,You told me I'd be free of this place. You promised.
01:11:36.793,01:11:38.127,You lied.
01:11:38.711,01:11:39.754,Laeddis.
01:11:52.517,01:11:54.811,-Your voice. -Don't you recognize it?
01:11:56.312,01:11:57.855,After all the talks we had?
01:11:59.273,01:12:01.025,After all the lies you told me?
01:12:01.484,01:12:02.735,Let me see your face.
01:12:03.736,01:12:05.029,They say I'm theirs now.
01:12:06.864,01:12:08.324,They say I'll never leave here.
01:12:10.409,01:12:11.953,Your match is about to go out.
01:12:15.122,01:12:17.458,-Let me see your goddamn face! Now! -Why?
01:12:18.334,01:12:19.794,So you can lie to me more?
01:12:20.670,01:12:22.713,"-This isn't about the truth. -Yes, it is."
01:12:23.214,01:12:25.341,-It's about exposing the truth. -It's about you!
01:12:26.926,01:12:28.135,And Laeddis.
01:12:29.762,01:12:30.930,That's all it's ever been about.
01:12:32.723,01:12:34.350,I was incidental.
01:12:35.518,01:12:36.602,A way in.
01:12:39.772,01:12:42.608,George… George Noyce.
01:12:43.526,01:12:44.527,No.
01:12:44.777,01:12:48.155,-It's not possible. You can't be here. -You like it?
01:12:50.283,01:12:51.826,"Who did this to you, George?"
01:12:52.285,01:12:53.286,You did.
01:12:54.120,01:12:55.121,What the hell do you mean?
01:12:55.788,01:12:59.250,All your talk. All your fucking talk. And I'm back in here because of you.
01:12:59.792,01:13:02.128,"George, how did-- how did they get you out of Dedham, huh?"
01:13:02.461,01:13:06.591,"However this happened, I-- I'm gonna find a way to fix this, -you understand me? -I'll never get out now."
01:13:07.091,01:13:09.594,"I got out once. Not twice, never twice."
01:13:09.677,01:13:11.470,Just tell me how they got you here.
01:13:11.679,01:13:14.265,They knew! Don't you get it?
01:13:15.057,01:13:17.685,Everything you were up to. Your whole plan.
01:13:18.644,01:13:22.189,"This is a game. All of this, is for you."
01:13:22.982,01:13:24.609,You're not investigating anything.
01:13:25.276,01:13:27.445,You're a fucking rat in a maze.
01:13:28.946,01:13:32.325,"Georgie, George, you're wrong. You're wrong."
01:13:33.367,01:13:34.368,Really?
01:13:35.036,01:13:36.412,Been alone much since you got here?
01:13:38.539,01:13:40.207,"I mean, I've been with my partner."
01:13:41.000,01:13:42.418,"You never worked with him before, have you?"
01:13:45.087,01:13:49.759,"He's a-- he's a U.S. Marshal. He's-- You never worked with him before, have you?"
01:13:53.179,01:13:57.058,"George, look, I-- I know people. I-- I trust this man."
01:14:02.146,01:14:03.522,"Then, they've already won."
01:14:07.026,01:14:08.027,Fuck.
01:14:12.740,01:14:15.952,And they're gonna take me to the lighthouse.
01:14:17.536,01:14:19.455,They're gonna cut into my brain.
01:14:20.873,01:14:24.168,And I'm only here because of you!
01:14:25.211,01:14:27.421,"George, I'm… I'm gonna get you out of here."
01:14:27.505,01:14:29.924,You're not going to the lighthouse. You're not.
01:14:30.049,01:14:32.802,You can't dig out the truth and kill Laeddis at the same time.
01:14:32.885,01:14:35.680,"You gotta make a choice. You understand that, don't you?"
01:14:36.847,01:14:39.433,-I'm not here to kill anyone. -Liar!
01:14:39.892,01:14:42.687,"I'm not gonna kill him, I swear to you! I swear."
01:14:43.229,01:14:44.230,She's dead.
01:14:45.564,01:14:46.816,She-- let her go.
01:14:48.734,01:14:49.735,Let her go.
01:15:00.329,01:15:08.587,-Let her go. -Tell him about the day How I told you my heart was breaking and you asked me why.
01:15:08.713,01:15:11.382,She's fucking with your head.
01:15:11.465,01:15:13.342,And I told you it was from happiness.
01:15:13.426,01:15:15.803,She's gonna kill you. She's gonna kill you.
01:15:19.015,01:15:22.143,You wanna uncover the truth? You gotta let her go.
01:15:24.353,01:15:26.063,-I can't. -You have to let her go!
01:15:26.147,01:15:28.024,I can't! I can't.
01:15:34.905,01:15:36.741,"Then, you'll never leave this island."
01:15:43.205,01:15:44.206,Dolores.
01:15:51.380,01:15:52.757,He's not in this ward.
01:15:55.217,01:15:58.220,He was transferred… out of here.
01:16:00.389,01:16:05.019,"If he's not in Ward A, there's only one place he can be."
01:16:11.150,01:16:12.193,The lighthouse.
01:16:23.496,01:16:24.497,God help you.
01:16:37.927,01:16:39.678,They heard an orderly went batshit on a patient.
01:16:39.887,01:16:42.431,They're looking all over the place for him and they're on their way to the roof.
01:16:42.515,01:16:44.433,Let's get the hell out of here. This way.
01:16:47.603,01:16:49.355,Just keep going. We belong here.
01:16:59.782,01:17:00.783,What happened to you?
01:17:01.617,01:17:04.703,"-What do you mean? -I mean, where were you?"
01:17:05.579,01:17:09.458,"After we got that guy to the infirmary, I took a little detour to patient records."
01:17:10.626,01:17:11.627,Did you ever find Laeddis?
01:17:12.670,01:17:14.547,"No. No, I never found him."
01:17:14.630,01:17:17.133,"Well, I got the next best thing. His intake form."
01:17:17.633,01:17:23.055,"It was the only thing in his files. There's no session notes, no incident reports, no photographs, just this. It was weird."
01:17:23.681,01:17:24.974,Here. Take a look.
01:17:26.183,01:17:27.268,I'll look at it later.
01:17:29.520,01:17:30.521,"What's the matter, boss?"
01:17:31.522,01:17:32.815,"I'll look it over later, that's all."
01:17:36.110,01:17:39.280,-Ashecliffe's that way. -I'm not going to Ashecliffe.
01:17:40.990,01:17:42.324,I'm going to that lighthouse.
01:17:42.992,01:17:45.327,I'm gonna find out what the fuck is happening on this island.
01:17:59.508,01:18:00.509,There it is.
01:18:01.760,01:18:05.472,Damn. We're too far south. We're gonna have to double back.
01:18:05.890,01:18:07.600,There's no way we could cross those rocks.
01:18:08.142,01:18:09.894,There could be a way behind those trees.
01:18:09.977,01:18:14.481,"Maybe, maybe a path that goes around the rocks and leads over -to the lighthouse, come on. -Boss, wait, wait, what are we doing?"
01:18:14.565,01:18:16.066,We got the intake form.
01:18:16.650,01:18:20.571,"It's proof there's a 67th patient, which they said, repeatedly, doesn't exist."
01:18:21.906,01:18:24.992,I'm getting to that lighthouse. You understand?
01:18:27.328,01:18:29.079,What the hell can I say to you to stop you?
01:18:29.163,01:18:31.123,"Why-- why would you want to, Chuck? Why?"
01:18:31.540,01:18:36.128,"Because climbing down there when it's dark is a thin step short of suicide, that's why."
01:18:36.795,01:18:37.796,Okay.
01:18:38.589,01:18:40.174,Maybe you better sit this one out then.
01:18:41.717,01:18:48.849,"You brought me into this, boss, and now we're trapped here on this rock, on this island, with no one to rely on but each other."
01:18:48.933,01:18:52.353,"And now you're, you're acting like-- Like what? Like what?"
01:18:52.937,01:18:53.979,How am I acting?
01:18:58.609,01:19:00.986,"What the hell happened back there in those cells, Ted?"
01:19:06.659,01:19:08.953,"What do you think the weather's like in Portland, Chuck?"
01:19:10.329,01:19:11.455,I'm from Seattle.
01:19:14.583,01:19:15.584,Seattle.
01:19:18.963,01:19:21.757,I'm going on… alone.
01:19:24.718,01:19:27.471,"-I'm going with you, boss. -I said alone."
01:19:29.265,01:19:30.266,Fine.
01:19:57.042,01:19:58.043,Damn it!
01:19:59.378,01:20:00.379,Damn it.
01:20:05.968,01:20:09.638,"I knew it wouldn't take long, but I couldn't get to it. The tide was up."
01:20:18.605,01:20:19.606,Chuck!
01:20:22.318,01:20:23.319,Chuck!
01:21:25.130,01:21:26.131,Come on!
01:22:01.708,01:22:02.751,Chuck!
01:22:03.335,01:22:05.254,"Where are you, Chuck?"
01:22:29.903,01:22:30.904,Chuck!
01:22:32.823,01:22:33.824,Chuck!
01:23:21.997,01:23:24.791,I'm Teddy Daniels. I'm a cop.
01:23:26.251,01:23:27.252,You're the Marshal.
01:23:29.004,01:23:30.005,That's right.
01:23:32.758,01:23:36.637,"Would you mind taking your hand from behind your back, please?"
01:23:39.973,01:23:42.059,I wanna make sure that what you're holding won't hurt me.
01:23:50.692,01:23:54.947,I'm gonna keep this… if you don't mind.
01:24:06.833,01:24:10.963,You're… you're Rachel Solando.
01:24:12.881,01:24:13.882,The real one.
01:24:18.220,01:24:19.596,Did you kill your children?
01:24:21.682,01:24:22.891,I never had children.
01:24:24.268,01:24:25.435,I was never married.
01:24:27.563,01:24:30.691,"And before I was a patient at Ashecliffe, I worked here."
01:24:31.733,01:24:34.111,You-- you were a nurse?
01:24:36.655,01:24:38.156,"I was a doctor, Marshal."
01:24:42.035,01:24:43.036,You think I'm crazy.
01:24:44.162,01:24:46.748,"-No. No, no, I never-- -And if I say I'm not crazy?"
01:24:48.625,01:24:49.876,"Well, that hardly helps, does it?"
01:24:51.920,01:24:53.672,That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.
01:24:57.634,01:25:03.056,"People tell the world you're crazy, and all your protests to the contrary just confirm what they're saying."
01:25:04.600,01:25:07.686,I'm-- I'm not following you. I'm sorry.
01:25:08.353,01:25:13.775,"Once you're declared insane, then anything you do is called part of that insanity."
01:25:14.026,01:25:16.194,Reasonable protests are denial.
01:25:17.070,01:25:19.656,"Valid fears, paranoia."
01:25:19.906,01:25:23.493,Survival instincts are defense mechanisms.
01:25:24.077,01:25:26.788,"You're smarter than you look, Marshal. That's probably not a good thing."
01:25:28.707,01:25:30.834,-Tell me something. -Yeah.
01:25:32.544,01:25:33.879,What happened to you?
01:25:35.130,01:25:40.218,I started asking about these large shipments of sodium amytal and opium-based hallucinogens.
01:25:40.510,01:25:41.845,Psychotropic drugs.
01:25:43.555,01:25:45.015,"I asked about the surgeries, too."
01:25:47.976,01:25:49.895,You ever heard of a transorbital lobotomy?
01:25:51.647,01:25:56.943,"They zap the patient with electroshock, then go through the eye with an ice pick."
01:25:59.488,01:26:00.864,Pull out some nerve fibers.
01:26:02.157,01:26:03.158,Huh.
01:26:03.992,01:26:05.619,Makes the patients much more obedient.
01:26:06.578,01:26:07.579,Tractable.
01:26:09.373,01:26:10.374,It's barbaric.
01:26:11.750,01:26:12.751,Unconscionable.
01:26:14.294,01:26:18.048,"Do you know how pain enters the body, Marshal? Do you?"
01:26:19.424,01:26:21.259,-Depends on where you're hurt? -No.
01:26:22.135,01:26:26.014,It has nothing to do with the flesh. The brain controls pain.
01:26:26.682,01:26:30.894,"The brain controls fear, empathy, sleep, hunger, anger, everything."
01:26:33.438,01:26:34.690,What if you could control it?
01:26:35.691,01:26:44.032,"-You mean, the brain? -Recreate a man, so he doesn't feel pain, or love or-- or sympathy."
01:26:45.492,01:26:49.621,"A man who can't be interrogated, because he has no memories to confess."
01:26:52.416,01:26:55.085,You can never take away all a man's memories.
01:26:55.669,01:27:02.050,"-Never. -Marshal, the North Koreans used American POWs, during their brainwashing experiments."
01:27:02.134,01:27:05.470,They turned soldiers into traitors. That's what they're doing here.
01:27:05.595,01:27:16.940,"They're creating ghosts to go out in the world and do things sane men-- -sane men never would. -To have that kind of ability, that kind of knowledge, -that-- that would take years. -Years. Years of research."
01:27:17.190,01:27:19.568,Hundreds of patients to experiment on.
01:27:21.236,01:27:26.908,"Fifty years from now, people will look back and say, here, this place, is where it all began."
01:27:27.784,01:27:36.793,"The Nazis used the Jews, Soviets used prisoners in their own Gulags, and we… we tested patients… on Shutter Island."
01:27:38.587,01:27:39.713,"No, they won't."
01:27:41.089,01:27:42.299,No.
01:27:44.760,01:27:51.016,You do understand… that they can't let you leave.
01:27:51.892,01:27:55.270,I am a federal Marshal. They can't stop me.
01:27:56.563,01:28:01.735,"I was an esteemed psychiatrist, from a respected family."
01:28:03.862,01:28:04.905,Didn't matter.
01:28:08.200,01:28:09.242,Let me ask you.
01:28:09.826,01:28:11.453,Any past traumas in your life?
01:28:13.580,01:28:14.581,Yes.
01:28:15.957,01:28:17.709,But why-- why would that matter?
01:28:18.043,01:28:22.547,Because they're gonna point to some event in your past and say it's the reason you lost your sanity.
01:28:23.089,01:28:29.721,"So that when they commit you here, your friends and colleagues will say, Of course, he cracked."
01:28:31.556,01:28:32.891,Who wouldn't after what he'd been through?
01:28:32.974,01:28:35.393,"They can say that about anyone, anyone at all."
01:28:35.477,01:28:37.437,The point is they're gonna say it about you.
01:28:41.650,01:28:42.692,How's your head?
01:28:43.235,01:28:45.153,My-- my head?
01:28:45.529,01:28:48.740,Any funny dreams lately? Trouble sleeping?
01:28:51.076,01:28:56.498,"-Headaches? -I-- -I am prone to migraines, yes. -Jesus."
01:28:59.125,01:29:02.671,"You haven't taken any pills, have you? I mean, even aspirin?"
01:29:02.796,01:29:04.714,-The-- the aspirin? -Jesus.
01:29:05.549,01:29:09.010,"And you-- you ate the food in the cafeteria, and drunk the coffee they gave you?"
01:29:09.219,01:29:12.013,"You tell me, at least, that you've been smoking your own cigarettes."
01:29:14.558,01:29:15.559,No.
01:29:16.726,01:29:17.727,No.
01:29:19.020,01:29:20.021,"No, I haven't."
01:29:20.230,01:29:25.694,It takes 36 to 48 hours for neuroleptic narcotics to reach workable levels in the bloodstream.
01:29:27.571,01:29:32.367,"Palsy comes first… first the fingertips, then eventually the whole hand."
01:29:34.828,01:29:38.874,"Seen any walking nightmares lately, Marshal, huh?"
01:29:41.376,01:29:43.420,Tell me what goes on in that lighthouse.
01:29:45.338,01:29:46.339,Tell me.
01:29:47.799,01:29:48.884,Brain surgery.
01:29:50.093,01:29:52.888,The Let's open the skull and see what happens if we pull on this kind.
01:29:54.931,01:29:56.850,The learned it from the Nazis kind.
01:30:00.061,01:30:01.605,That's where they create the ghosts.
01:30:03.857,01:30:07.611,"Who knows about this? On the island, I mean. Who?"
01:30:10.280,01:30:11.281,Everyone.
01:30:11.448,01:30:15.035,Come on. The-- the nurses? The-- the orderlies?
01:30:15.911,01:30:18.246,-They-- they couldn't possibly know. -Everyone.
01:30:38.016,01:30:39.100,You can't stay here.
01:30:40.185,01:30:41.436,"They think I'm dead, that I drowned."
01:30:41.519,01:30:43.730,"I'm afraid if they come looking for you, they might find me."
01:30:44.648,01:30:46.274,"I'm sorry, but you have to go."
01:30:53.573,01:30:54.741,I'm gonna come back for you.
01:30:55.283,01:30:57.994,I won't be here. I move during the day. New places every night.
01:30:58.370,01:31:00.664,But I could come get you-- get you off this island.
01:31:00.747,01:31:02.499,Haven't you heard a word I've said?
01:31:03.583,01:31:06.753,"The only way off the island is the ferry, and they control it."
01:31:07.837,01:31:08.964,You'll never leave here.
01:31:19.140,01:31:20.183,I had a friend.
01:31:21.059,01:31:23.436,"I was with him yesterday, but we got separated."
01:31:24.646,01:31:25.647,Have you seen him?
01:31:27.524,01:31:31.611,Marshal… you have no friends.
01:32:04.811,01:32:05.979,There you are.
01:32:09.315,01:32:10.942,We were wondering when you'd show up.
01:32:13.486,01:32:14.487,Have a seat.
01:32:15.530,01:32:16.573,Come on.
01:32:27.500,01:32:29.627,"Taking a leisurely stroll, were we?"
01:32:31.296,01:32:34.132,I was just-- just looking around.
01:32:37.302,01:32:39.012,Did you enjoy God's latest gift?
01:32:41.264,01:32:42.515,-What? -God's gift.
01:32:44.768,01:32:45.769,The violence.
01:32:48.980,01:32:57.197,"When I came downstairs in my home and I saw that tree in my living room, it reached out for me, like a divine hand."
01:32:59.449,01:33:00.867,God loves violence.
01:33:07.916,01:33:09.501,Why else would there be so much of it?
01:33:10.543,01:33:13.004,It's in us. It's what we are.
01:33:15.090,01:33:20.095,"We wage war, we burn sacrifices, and pillage and plunder and tear at the flesh of our brothers."
01:33:20.220,01:33:24.182,And why? Because God gave us violence to wage in his honor.
01:33:27.393,01:33:29.354,I thought God gave us moral order.
01:33:29.854,01:33:32.065,There's no moral order as pure as this storm.
01:33:33.483,01:33:34.943,There's no moral order at all.
01:33:36.069,01:33:39.364,"There's just this, can my violence conquer yours?"
01:33:45.286,01:33:46.996,"-I'm not violent. -Yes, you are."
01:33:48.790,01:33:50.333,You're as violent as they come.
01:33:51.835,01:33:54.254,I know this because I'm as violent as they come.
01:33:55.588,01:34:03.680,"If the constraints of society were lifted, and I was all that stood between you and a meal, you would crack my skull with a rock and eat my meaty parts."
01:34:05.849,01:34:06.850,Wouldn't you?
01:34:10.103,01:34:13.815,"Cawley thinks you're harmless, that you can be controlled, but I know different."
01:34:15.233,01:34:17.235,"-You don't know me. -Oh, but I do."
01:34:17.318,01:34:19.279,"-No, you don't. You don't know me at all. -I know you."
01:34:20.238,01:34:21.948,We've known each other for centuries.
01:34:32.375,01:34:38.089,"If I was to sink my teeth into your eye right now, would you be able to stop me before I blinded you?"
01:34:42.802,01:34:43.803,Give it a try.
01:34:46.014,01:34:47.223,That's the spirit.
01:35:26.763,01:35:28.306,-Not really. -Something I've seen.
01:35:28.473,01:35:29.474,Okay.
01:35:34.896,01:35:35.897,Where have you been?
01:35:37.148,01:35:39.484,Just wandering. Just looking at your island.
01:35:39.609,01:35:42.111,"Oh, I forgot you're leaving, now that Rachel's been found."
01:35:47.158,01:35:48.243,Stop looking at him.
01:35:48.952,01:35:50.787,"-Big meeting? -Oh, yes."
01:35:51.120,01:35:52.538,-It's okay. I'm-- -I don't like that.
01:35:52.664,01:35:56.209,"Apparently, there was an unidentified man in Ward C yesterday."
01:35:56.334,01:35:59.379,He subdued a highly dangerous patient quite handily.
01:36:00.463,01:36:04.759,"-Is that so? -It seems he had a long conversation with a paranoid schizophrenic, George Noyce."
01:36:08.054,01:36:09.639,We're gated down. We're fine.
01:36:09.806,01:36:13.601,"This-- this Noyce, you said his name was, he's delusional?"
01:36:13.977,01:36:16.145,Extremely. He can be quite upsetting.
01:36:16.688,01:36:22.318,"As a matter of fact, two weeks ago, a patient got so wound up by one of Noyce's stories that he beat him up."
01:36:23.778,01:36:25.238,-Hmm. -Cigarette?
01:36:26.114,01:36:27.115,Oh.
01:36:27.490,01:36:28.574,"No, thanks. I quit."
01:36:30.326,01:36:39.127,"-So you're taking the ferry? -Yes, absolutely. I… I think we've gotten all we came here for, so… We, Marshal?"
01:36:41.379,01:36:45.591,"Speaking of which, have you-- -have you seen him, Doctor? -Who?"
01:36:46.968,01:36:48.177,"My partner, Chuck."
01:36:51.055,01:36:53.182,"You don't have a partner, Marshal. You came here alone."
01:36:56.227,01:37:01.774,"You know, I've built something valuable here, and valuable things have a way of being misunderstood in their own time."
01:37:01.858,01:37:03.943,Everyone wants a quick fix. They always have.
01:37:04.027,01:37:07.739,"I'm trying to do something that people, yourself included, don't understand."
01:37:07.822,01:37:09.907,And I'm not going to give up without a fight.
01:37:12.535,01:37:13.536,I can see that.
01:37:16.080,01:37:17.081,Hmm.
01:37:18.291,01:37:19.751,"So, tell me again about your partner."
01:37:22.587,01:37:23.588,What partner?
01:37:27.133,01:37:28.134,It's fine.
01:38:29.487,01:38:30.488,Marshal.
01:38:32.115,01:38:33.157,Going somewhere?
01:38:34.033,01:38:37.620,"I'm just-- just -heading out to the ferry, so… -Ah."
01:38:38.037,01:38:40.790,"Well, I'm afraid, I'm afraid it's the other way."
01:38:42.166,01:38:43.167,Oh.
01:38:44.252,01:38:49.006,"If you'll wait a moment, I'll… find you someone who can take you to the dock."
01:38:53.553,01:38:57.390,"-What's this, Doctor, huh? What's this? -It's-- it's just a sedative."
01:38:57.682,01:39:00.351,"-A precaution. -Oh, precaution."
01:39:03.813,01:39:07.150,What are you going to do? Kill me? Marshal.
01:39:08.067,01:39:09.527,You think you deserve it?
01:39:09.777,01:39:12.697,"For what, hmm? Provoking you?"
01:39:13.364,01:39:16.200,"Well, forgive me. What doesn't provoke you?"
01:39:16.742,01:39:19.787,-Remarks? Words? -Nazis?
01:39:20.329,01:39:21.330,"Well, that, too."
01:39:22.331,01:39:24.333,"And, of course, memories and dreams."
01:39:25.376,01:39:29.755,Did you know that the word trauma comes from the Greek for wound?
01:39:30.381,01:39:32.383,And what is the German word for dream?
01:39:36.804,01:39:42.727,"Wounds can create monsters, and you, you are wounded, Marshal."
01:39:43.769,01:39:48.816,"And wouldn't you agree, when you see a monster, you must stop it?"
01:39:50.109,01:39:51.110,Yeah.
01:39:52.361,01:39:53.529,-I agree. -Yes.
01:39:55.031,01:39:56.032,Yeah.
01:40:15.426,01:40:16.332,Yeah.
01:40:47.875,01:40:50.086,-You gotta get to the ferry. -No.
01:40:51.337,01:40:52.338,"No, no."
01:40:53.673,01:40:54.674,Yeah.
01:40:55.967,01:41:00.012,"If the world thinks that Chuck is dead, then he's perfect for their experiments."
01:41:01.931,01:41:03.474,There's only one place they'd take him.
01:41:06.978,01:41:08.020,"You go there, and you'll die."
01:41:08.354,01:41:12.650,"He's my partner. If they are hurting him, if they're holding him against his will, I've gotta bring him out."
01:41:13.526,01:41:14.652,I can't lose anyone else.
01:41:15.695,01:41:16.821,"Don't go, Teddy, please."
01:41:24.036,01:41:25.037,"I'm sorry, honey."
01:41:26.831,01:41:28.958,I love this thing because you gave it to me.
01:41:32.503,01:41:37.550,The truth is… it's one fucking ugly tie.
01:42:18.215,01:42:19.216,No.
01:43:41.465,01:43:42.591,Don't move! Stay where you are!
01:43:44.719,01:43:46.011,Are you gonna kill me?
01:43:47.722,01:43:49.932,"No, I'm not gonna kill you."
01:45:42.878,01:45:44.338,"Why are you all wet, baby?"
01:45:46.924,01:45:49.218,-What did you say? -You know exactly what I said.
01:46:03.274,01:46:04.900,"The rifle's empty, by the way."
01:46:12.074,01:46:13.075,Have a seat.
01:46:20.082,01:46:22.459,"For God's sake, dry off. You'll catch a cold."
01:46:24.086,01:46:25.087,All right.
01:46:28.841,01:46:30.551,How badly did you hurt the guard?
01:46:32.469,01:46:34.972,I-- I don't know what you're talking about.
01:46:38.434,01:46:39.560,"Yes, he's here."
01:46:40.477,01:46:43.397,Have Dr. Sheehan take a look at your man before you send him up.
01:46:44.690,01:46:49.320,"So… Dr. Sheehan came in on the ferry this morning, huh?"
01:46:50.446,01:46:51.447,Not exactly.
01:46:53.073,01:46:55.326,You blew up my car. I really loved that car.
01:46:56.911,01:46:58.245,Sorry to hear about that.
01:47:02.291,01:47:03.375,Tremors are getting pretty bad.
01:47:05.252,01:47:06.462,How are the hallucinations?
01:47:10.132,01:47:11.884,This place is gonna be the end of you.
01:47:15.846,01:47:17.723,-Not bad. -They'll get worse.
01:47:18.807,01:47:19.808,I know.
01:47:20.225,01:47:24.647,Dr. Solando… she told me about the neuroleptics.
01:47:25.230,01:47:27.608,"Did she, now? And when was this?"
01:47:27.816,01:47:33.614,"I found her, Doctor, in a cave… out by the cliffs. But, you'll never get to her."
01:47:33.906,01:47:37.576,I don't doubt it… considering she's not real.
01:47:39.870,01:47:41.956,Your delusions are more severe than I thought.
01:47:44.166,01:47:45.459,You're not on neuroleptics.
01:47:46.710,01:47:48.504,"You're not on anything, as a matter of fact."
01:47:48.629,01:47:51.256,Then what the fuck is this? Huh? What the fuck is this?
01:47:51.423,01:47:52.424,Withdrawal.
01:47:52.967,01:47:54.134,With-- withdrawal?
01:47:54.677,01:47:57.721,"From, from what? I haven't had a goddamn drink since I've been on this island."
01:47:57.846,01:47:58.847,Chlorpromazine.
01:48:00.391,01:48:06.689,"I'm not a fan of pharmacology, but I have to say, in your case… -Chlo-- chloraproma what? -Chlorpromazine."
01:48:07.398,01:48:11.235,The same thing we've been giving you for the past 24 months.
01:48:13.153,01:48:18.033,"So for the past two years, you-- you've had somebody slipping me drugs in Boston, is that it?"
01:48:18.200,01:48:19.284,Not Boston.
01:48:20.244,01:48:21.245,Here.
01:48:22.246,01:48:26.375,You've been here for two years. A patient of this institution.
01:48:30.045,01:48:36.385,"After everything I've seen here, doctor, you-- you really think you're gonna convince me I'm crazy, huh?"
01:48:37.136,01:48:39.263,Do you know the kind of people that I deal with every day?
01:48:39.346,01:48:41.140,"I'm a U.S. Marshal, for God's sakes."
01:48:41.223,01:48:43.142,You were a U.S. Marshal.
01:48:43.225,01:48:47.062,Here's a copy of the intake form. You broke into Ward C-4.
01:48:47.187,01:48:51.564,"Proof of the 67th patient. If you'd gotten it to the mainland, you could have blown the lid off this place."
01:48:51.650,01:48:55.946,"-Wait. Where did-- Where did you-- -Yet somehow, you couldn't find time to look at it. Well, read it now."
01:48:56.905,01:48:57.906,Go ahead.
01:49:02.161,01:49:05.456,"Patient is highly intelligent, highly delusional decorated Army veteran."
01:49:05.998,01:49:08.792,Present for the liber-- Liberation of Dachau.
01:49:09.918,01:49:12.629,F-- Former U.S. Marshal. Known proclivity for violence.
01:49:12.713,01:49:16.759,"Shows no remorse for his crime because he denies the crime ever, ever took place."
01:49:16.925,01:49:21.472,"Highly developed and fantastical narratives, which preclude facing the truth of his actions."
01:49:21.722,01:49:24.099,"I've had enough of this bullshit! Where's-- where's my partner, huh?"
01:49:24.308,01:49:25.642,Where's Chuck? Where is he?
01:49:26.643,01:49:28.062,Let's try this another way.
01:49:28.395,01:49:30.647,"Your wife's maiden name was Chanal, am I correct?"
01:49:30.856,01:49:32.274,Don't you even talk about her.
01:49:32.399,01:49:33.609,-Don't you-- -I'm afraid I have to.
01:49:36.445,01:49:38.489,Notice anything these four names have in common?
01:49:38.947,01:49:40.199,It's your rule of four.
01:49:40.824,01:49:41.825,"Andrew, what do you see?"
01:49:41.909,01:49:46.997,"If you've done anything to my partner, Doctor, that is a violation of-- Focus, Andrew! What do you see?"
01:49:48.540,01:49:50.793,The names have the same letters.
01:49:52.086,01:49:55.297,Edward Daniels has exactly the same 13 letters as Andrew Laeddis.
01:49:55.506,01:49:57.716,The same as Rachel Solando and Dolores Chanal.
01:49:57.800,01:49:59.551,The names are anagrams for each other.
01:49:59.843,01:50:03.889,"Your tactics, -they're-- they're not gonna work on me. -You came here for the truth."
01:50:04.264,01:50:05.265,Here it is.
01:50:05.432,01:50:07.309,Your name is Andrew Laeddis.
01:50:07.518,01:50:10.521,"The 67th patient at Ashecliffe is you, Andrew."
01:50:13.232,01:50:16.235,-Bullshit. -You were committed here by court order 24 months ago.
01:50:16.318,01:50:21.532,"Your crime is terrible, one you can't forgive yourself for, so you invented another self."
01:50:24.243,01:50:25.244,All right.
01:50:26.745,01:50:31.750,"Let's-- let's get down to the facts, -all right? -You've created a story in which you're not a murderer."
01:50:31.875,01:50:43.220,"You're a hero, still a U.S. Marshal, only here at Ashecliffe because of a case, and you've uncovered a conspiracy so that anything we tell you about who you are, what you've done, you can dismiss as lies, Andrew."
01:50:43.387,01:50:44.888,My name is Edward Daniels.
01:50:45.013,01:50:48.642,I've been hearing this fantasy for two years now. I know every detail.
01:50:49.017,01:50:54.231,"Patient 67, the storm, Rachel Solando, your missing partner, the dreams you have every night."
01:50:54.356,01:50:56.817,"You were at Dachau, but you may not have killed any guards."
01:51:00.821,01:51:03.740,I wish I could let you just live in your fantasy world.
01:51:04.366,01:51:05.367,I really do.
01:51:07.077,01:51:10.747,"But you're violent, trained, dangerous. You're the most dangerous patient we have."
01:51:11.582,01:51:13.834,"You've injured orderlies, guards, other patients."
01:51:13.959,01:51:15.878,"Two weeks ago, you attacked George Noyce."
01:51:16.003,01:51:18.005,"No, no. I am fucking on to you, Doctor."
01:51:18.297,01:51:20.132,-You had Noyce beaten. -Of course I didn't!
01:51:20.340,01:51:22.134,Give me one reason why I would even touch him!
01:51:22.384,01:51:27.055,"Because he called you Laeddis, and you'd do anything not to be him."
01:51:28.015,01:51:31.560,I have a transcript of the conversation you had with Noyce yesterday.
01:51:31.685,01:51:35.480,"This is about you, and Laeddis, that's all it's ever been about."
01:51:37.649,01:51:40.235,"No, no. He's saying this is about me and Laeddis."
01:51:40.319,01:51:45.115,"When you asked him what happened to his face, he said, now here I'm quoting again, You did this."
01:51:45.699,01:51:49.286,"-No, no, he meant that it was my fault. -You almost killed him."
01:51:51.538,01:51:54.333,The warden and the Board of Overseers are determined something be done.
01:51:54.416,01:52:04.259,"It's been decided, that unless we can bring you back to sanity now, right now, permanent measures will be taken to ensure you can't hurt anyone ever again."
01:52:07.804,01:52:09.223,"They'll lobotomize you, Andrew."
01:52:10.140,01:52:11.141,Do you understand?
01:52:15.479,01:52:16.563,"Yeah, I understand."
01:52:18.273,01:52:19.650,I-- I understand just fine.
01:52:21.068,01:52:27.783,"If I-- if I don't play along with your little game here, Dr. Naehring's gonna turn me into one of his ghosts."
01:52:28.700,01:52:29.993,But what about my partner?
01:52:30.244,01:52:33.914,You-- you're gonna tell the U.S. Marshal's office that he's a defense mechanism?
01:52:36.583,01:52:37.584,"Hello, boss."
01:52:54.977,01:52:57.521,What-- what the fuck is going on here?
01:52:59.106,01:53:00.107,Huh?
01:53:02.859,01:53:04.194,You-- are you working for him?
01:53:05.028,01:53:06.613,I'm sorry. There wasn't any other way.
01:53:06.738,01:53:08.782,"Someone had to stick with you, keep you safe."
01:53:12.494,01:53:13.704,"You been watching me, huh?"
01:53:15.539,01:53:16.707,Watching me every minute.
01:53:18.500,01:53:19.710,"Who, who are you?"
01:53:20.544,01:53:21.628,Who are you? Tell me.
01:53:22.254,01:53:23.922,"Don't you recognize me, Andrew?"
01:53:25.716,01:53:28.510,I've been your primary psychiatrist for the last two years.
01:53:30.012,01:53:31.221,I'm Lester Sheehan.
01:53:38.395,01:53:41.106,"I told you-- I told you about my wife, -I-- -I know."
01:53:41.189,01:53:44.276,I climbed down a cliff to get you. I-- I trusted you.
01:53:44.359,01:53:47.195,I-- I risked everything to come in here after you.
01:53:47.279,01:53:48.947,"-Everything! -I know, boss."
01:53:49.281,01:53:50.741,"We're running out of time here, Andrew."
01:53:52.367,01:54:00.375,"I swore before the Board of Overseers that I could construct the most radical, cutting-edge role-play ever attempted in psychiatry, and it would bring you back."
01:54:00.459,01:54:06.548,"I thought that if we let you play this out, we could get you to see how untrue, how impossible it is."
01:54:08.216,01:54:10.010,You've had the run of the place for two days.
01:54:10.802,01:54:13.472,"Tell me, where are the Nazi experiments?"
01:54:14.264,01:54:15.557,The satanic ORs?
01:54:33.867,01:54:38.580,"If we fail with you, then everything that we've tried to do here will be discredited."
01:54:38.663,01:54:39.664,Everything.
01:54:42.250,01:54:44.419,"We're on the front lines of a war here, old boy."
01:54:46.254,01:54:48.465,"And right now, it all comes down to you."
01:54:56.014,01:54:58.433,-Don't move! Don't move! -Andrew! Andrew! No.
01:54:58.642,01:55:01.103,-No. -My name is Edward Daniels!
01:55:02.104,01:55:04.231,This one's loaded. I can tell by the weight.
01:55:04.314,01:55:06.525,"I see. And that's your firearm, Marshal? You're sure?"
01:55:06.900,01:55:08.193,My initials are on the side!
01:55:08.276,01:55:10.529,There's a dent in the barrel from when Philip Stacks shot at me.
01:55:10.612,01:55:12.697,"You're not gonna fuck with my mind on this one, doctor!"
01:55:13.949,01:55:16.118,Because that's the only way you're ever getting off this island.
01:55:23.333,01:55:24.709,"Andrew, please, don't."
01:55:36.221,01:55:37.222,My gun.
01:55:44.396,01:55:45.856,What did you do to my goddamn gun?
01:55:46.898,01:55:48.066,"It's a toy, Andrew."
01:55:51.653,01:55:53.029,We're telling you the truth.
01:55:54.197,01:55:57.492,"Dolores was insane, manic-depressive, suicidal."
01:55:58.118,01:56:01.246,"You drank, stayed away, ignored what everyone told you."
01:56:01.413,01:56:05.584,You moved to that lake house after she purposely set your city apartment on fire.
01:56:05.709,01:56:07.002,-You were-- -You're lying.
01:56:12.549,01:56:14.634,"Your children. Andrew, your children."
01:56:15.886,01:56:16.887,Simon.
01:56:17.762,01:56:19.890,-Henry. -I never had any children.
01:56:20.515,01:56:24.102,"Your wife drowned them, at the cabin by the lake."
01:56:24.436,01:56:29.316,"And here, the little girl, the one you dream of, every night."
01:56:30.150,01:56:31.234,I never had a little girl.
01:56:31.318,01:56:36.156,"The one who tells you over and over that you should have saved her, saved them all."
01:56:36.990,01:56:41.953,"Your daughter, her name was Rachel. Are you going to deny that she ever lived?"
01:56:43.163,01:56:44.331,"Andrew, are you?"
01:57:14.611,01:57:16.446,I told you not to come in here.
01:57:17.405,01:57:21.201,"I told you, this would be the end of you."
01:57:41.555,01:57:42.556,I'm back!
01:57:43.515,01:57:45.600,We got him just outside of Oklahoma.
01:57:46.309,01:57:48.853,Must've stopped ten places in between here and Tulsa.
01:57:48.937,01:57:50.272,I could sleep for a week.
01:57:55.110,01:57:56.111,Dolores?
01:58:03.243,01:58:04.244,Dolores?
01:58:12.590,01:58:13.945,"…Then he said, Take up your bed and walk."
01:58:14.051,01:58:15.380,"Forgive sins, but God?"
01:58:27.350,01:58:28.351,Dolores?
01:58:53.918,01:58:54.919,Baby.
01:58:57.213,01:58:58.340,Why are you all wet?
01:59:01.384,01:59:02.385,I missed you.
01:59:10.352,01:59:11.603,I wanna go home.
01:59:15.106,01:59:16.107,You are home.
01:59:21.821,01:59:22.947,Where are the kids?
01:59:25.825,01:59:26.826,Huh?
01:59:27.744,01:59:28.745,They're in school.
01:59:33.708,01:59:35.585,"It's Saturday, honey."
01:59:36.836,01:59:38.421,School's not in on Saturday.
01:59:41.675,01:59:43.176,My school is.
01:59:56.606,01:59:57.941,"Oh, my God."
02:00:00.402,02:00:01.528,"Oh, my God!"
02:00:15.083,02:00:17.669,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
02:00:20.213,02:00:21.214,Ah!
02:00:21.923,02:00:23.174,"Oh, my God. No!"
02:00:27.887,02:00:28.888,"Come on, come on."
02:00:42.944,02:00:45.989,"No. No. Please, God."
02:00:48.074,02:00:49.659,"Please, God. No!"
02:00:54.956,02:00:56.082,No.
02:01:01.504,02:01:02.505,No.
02:01:05.258,02:01:06.259,No.
02:01:50.970,02:01:51.971,Baby.
02:02:11.115,02:02:12.534,"Let's put them at the table, Andrew."
02:02:14.410,02:02:17.580,We'll dry them off. We'll change their clothes.
02:02:19.666,02:02:22.085,They'll be our living dolls. Huh.
02:02:26.047,02:02:27.757,"Tomorrow, we can take them on a picnic."
02:02:33.847,02:02:38.518,"If you ever loved me, Dolores, please stop talking."
02:02:45.066,02:02:46.150,I love you.
02:02:55.243,02:02:56.870,Set me free.
02:03:01.499,02:03:02.876,"Oh, baby."
02:03:06.254,02:03:07.881,We'll give them baths.
02:03:11.509,02:03:14.679,"-I love you, baby. -I love you, too."
02:03:14.929,02:03:16.639,-I love you so much. -I love you so much.
02:03:49.881,02:03:50.882,Andrew.
02:03:52.967,02:03:54.302,"Andrew, can you hear me?"
02:03:57.972,02:03:59.182,"Rachel, Rachel."
02:04:01.809,02:04:02.810,Rachel?
02:04:10.360,02:04:11.527,Rachel. Rachel Laeddis.
02:04:13.112,02:04:14.113,"My, my daughter."
02:04:18.493,02:04:19.535,Why are you here?
02:04:23.373,02:04:26.417,-Because I killed my wife. -And why did you do that?
02:04:32.131,02:04:33.841,Because she murdered our children.
02:04:36.636,02:04:38.137,And she told me to let her go.
02:04:42.308,02:04:45.436,-Who's Teddy Daniels? -He doesn't exist.
02:04:47.939,02:04:49.899,Neither does Rachel Solando. I made them up.
02:04:50.441,02:04:51.442,Why?
02:04:53.069,02:04:54.445,We need to hear you say it.
02:05:01.077,02:05:13.381,After she tried to kill herself the first time… Dolores told me she… she had an insect… living inside her brain.
02:05:15.550,02:05:24.434,"She could feel it… clicking across her skull, just… pulling the wires, just for fun."
02:05:28.104,02:05:29.397,She told me that.
02:05:31.441,02:05:32.900,"She told me that, but I didn't listen."
02:05:37.989,02:05:39.532,"I loved her so much, you know?"
02:05:46.080,02:05:48.708,Because I can't take knowing that Dolores killed our children.
02:05:53.713,02:06:01.721,"And I… I killed them 'cause I didn't, I didn't get her help, you know?"
02:06:06.350,02:06:07.351,I killed them.
02:06:12.648,02:06:18.154,"Here's my fear, Andrew. We-- we broke through once before, nine months ago, and then you regressed."
02:06:21.657,02:06:24.077,-I don't remember that. -I know.
02:06:25.578,02:06:26.788,"You reset, Andrew."
02:06:27.747,02:06:31.459,Like a tape playing over and over on an endless loop.
02:06:33.002,02:06:41.052,"I hope that what we've done here will be enough to stop it from ever happening again, but… I need to know you've accepted reality."
02:06:47.892,02:06:49.769,"You-- you came after me, huh, doctor?"
02:06:52.605,02:06:56.400,You-- you tried to help me when no one else would.
02:07:08.788,02:07:21.384,My name's Andrew Laeddis… and I murdered my wife in the spring of '52.
02:07:46.200,02:07:49.328,-How we doing this morning? -Good.
02:07:49.829,02:07:52.248,-And you? -Can't complain.
02:08:02.592,02:08:06.220,-So what's our next move? -You tell me.
02:08:12.018,02:08:13.686,"We gotta get off this rock, Chuck."
02:08:15.313,02:08:16.314,Get back to the mainland.
02:08:16.439,02:08:18.441,"Whatever the hell's going on here, it's bad."
02:08:41.088,02:08:43.132,"Don't worry, partner, they're not gonna catch us."
02:08:50.056,02:08:51.766,That's right. We're too smart for them.
02:08:54.018,02:08:55.228,"Yeah, we are, aren't we?"
02:09:11.911,02:09:13.663,"You know, this place makes me wonder."
02:09:14.997,02:09:16.290,"Yeah, what's that, boss?"
02:09:18.084,02:09:25.091,Which would be worse… to live as a monster… or to die as a good man?
02:09:34.850,02:09:35.851,Teddy?
