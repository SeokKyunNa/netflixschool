00:00:53.250,00:00:54.583,having quiet time.
00:01:00.333,00:01:01.958,Shh!
00:01:02.041,00:01:06.125,"Raffe, no slurping!"
00:01:09.125,00:01:12.708,"And the momma cow went, moo!"
00:01:21.000,00:01:21.833,Huh?
00:01:21.916,00:01:24.916,Little cookies are so...
00:01:26.333,00:01:27.583,Really!
00:01:30.916,00:01:32.125,That's not right.
00:01:36.125,00:01:43.625,"I'm trying to paint a perfect rainbow with the right colors, but I keep making mistakes."
00:01:44.500,00:01:46.458,The colors are all wrong!
00:01:46.750,00:01:47.583,Um...
00:01:48.416,00:01:51.375,"Franny, you're not being quiet."
00:02:00.416,00:02:02.750,But please ask nicely next time.
00:02:02.833,00:02:04.416,I'm sorry.
00:02:04.500,00:02:07.166,I'm just frustrated.
00:02:07.666,00:02:09.666,"It's okay, Franny."
00:02:10.125,00:02:11.666,"Maybe, um..."
00:02:12.333,00:02:14.625,Want to dance to a happy place?
00:02:16.750,00:02:17.791,"Yes, please."
00:02:51.291,00:02:54.208,-Get snappy. -And get clappy.
00:03:12.541,00:03:15.250,"-Feel better, Franny? -Much better, thanks."
00:03:15.333,00:03:16.833,Now you can keep painting.
00:03:16.916,00:03:19.125,"Uh... Oh, right."
00:03:20.458,00:03:22.750,It's a pretty rainbow.
00:03:23.250,00:03:25.166,But it's not perfect.
00:03:25.916,00:03:31.291,"That should be orange, that's supposed to be purple, or maybe yellow..."
00:03:33.250,00:03:35.500,I don't want to paint anymore.
00:03:35.583,00:03:37.708,I'm mad at colors.
00:03:41.541,00:03:44.166,I know a game we can play!
00:03:44.250,00:03:45.708,"What, what?"
00:03:46.125,00:03:49.000,Color monsters!
00:03:50.791,00:03:52.250,Uh...
00:03:52.333,00:03:54.208,But you're mad at colors.
00:03:54.791,00:03:59.583,"Yes, but what if the color monster has eaten all the colors?"
00:04:00.000,00:04:01.500,"Cool, right?"
00:04:01.958,00:04:05.250,But there's so many colors in the playroom.
00:04:05.333,00:04:07.250,How would we play that?
00:04:09.333,00:04:12.708,By using our imaginations.
00:04:30.541,00:04:31.666,Where's Franny?
00:04:46.000,00:04:47.083,N Ho.
00:04:47.791,00:04:50.291,"Um, Tilly, we're supposed to run."
00:04:50.375,00:04:54.083,And then Franny chases us until we find the color that stops her.
00:04:54.166,00:04:55.000,Okay?
00:05:37.750,00:05:40.166,"We have to, we have to..."
00:05:40.250,00:05:41.833,Stop that color monster.
00:05:42.500,00:05:44.125,But how?
00:05:44.208,00:05:47.250,"Well, one color always stops the color monster."
00:05:47.583,00:05:49.375,We just need to figure out which one.
00:05:49.791,00:05:52.916,But she took away all the colors.
00:05:54.000,00:05:56.333,This ball is black.
00:05:56.416,00:05:58.250,Black is a color.
00:05:59.250,00:06:02.250,"Oh, yeah! And Tilly's shovel is white."
00:06:02.333,00:06:03.958,"White is a color, too."
00:06:06.000,00:06:08.916,Nothing can stop me.
00:06:09.000,00:06:13.083,All the colors are gone!
00:06:13.166,00:06:16.833,Ha-ha! Not all the colors!
00:06:17.166,00:06:19.375,We have black.
00:06:19.458,00:06:21.166,And white.
00:06:24.291,00:06:28.250,Those colors do not stop the color monster!
00:06:28.583,00:06:30.833,But they're the only colors here.
00:06:31.208,00:06:32.583,That means...
00:06:32.958,00:06:33.958,I...
00:06:34.041,00:06:34.875,am...
00:06:35.125,00:06:37.958,unstoppable!
00:06:39.500,00:06:40.375,I see.
00:06:53.500,00:06:55.250,"Oh, look!"
00:06:55.333,00:06:56.875,-Bibibear! -Yeah!
00:06:57.250,00:06:59.000,Bibi's not black or white.
00:06:59.416,00:07:02.000,Bibi is... Bibi is...
00:07:02.083,00:07:03.833,What's the word for this color?
00:07:04.500,00:07:06.958,-I don't know. -I don't know either.
00:07:09.000,00:07:10.750,"Oh, uh... Time out!"
00:07:12.125,00:07:13.708,You can't call time out!
00:07:14.541,00:07:16.083,But we need Word Wally.
00:07:16.166,00:07:18.250,Oh. Okay.
00:07:32.875,00:07:35.250,in two languages: English and Mandarin.
00:07:35.333,00:07:37.166,And we need your help.
00:07:40.833,00:07:43.083,That's a dark color.
00:07:43.166,00:07:45.750,"What's the word for that, big kids?"
00:07:53.958,00:07:55.208,Hēisè.
00:07:59.458,00:08:02.375,"Oh, what's this color called, big kids?"
00:08:10.375,00:08:11.791,Báisè.
00:08:19.541,00:08:22.500,"-Huh? -Uh, I mean..."
00:08:22.583,00:08:25.708,"What's the word for this color, big kids?"
00:08:31.833,00:08:35.250,Gray! Good to know.
00:08:36.291,00:08:38.166,And what's it in Mandarin?
00:08:39.458,00:08:40.958,Huīsè.
00:08:42.541,00:08:45.458,"We learned the words, now let's have a..."
00:09:04.041,00:09:05.708,-Black! -Hēisè!
00:09:06.791,00:09:08.625,-White! -Báisè!
00:09:09.416,00:09:11.291,-Gray! -Huīsè!
00:09:31.333,00:09:36.958,"So, our word party's over, and you know what else is over?"
00:09:38.041,00:09:39.208,Time out!
00:09:41.291,00:09:42.958,Roar!
00:09:52.791,00:09:54.875,-Oh! Over there. -Huh? Oh!
00:09:55.416,00:09:59.333,A-ha! Nothing can stop me now.
00:09:59.791,00:10:02.083,"Oh, yes, something can!"
00:10:02.166,00:10:06.541,We have the color gray!
00:10:08.333,00:10:09.333,"Oh, no!"
00:10:09.583,00:10:15.458,Gray is the color that stops the color monster.
00:10:21.416,00:10:22.416,You win.
00:10:24.250,00:10:27.125,Yay! Franny's back!
00:10:28.791,00:10:30.416,"You are Franny, right?"
00:10:30.875,00:10:32.416,"Of course, silly."
00:10:35.083,00:10:37.791,"The colors are back, too."
00:10:40.041,00:10:42.750,I think I like it better with all the colors.
00:10:43.458,00:10:46.833,I'm ready to try painting again.
00:10:47.333,00:10:48.166,Let's go.
00:10:55.125,00:10:56.750,Okay...
00:10:57.375,00:10:58.875,A little more...
00:11:07.416,00:11:09.875,"Well, it's not perfect."
00:11:11.083,00:11:13.083,But I like it.
00:11:21.916,00:11:23.791,but Franny kept trying.
00:11:23.875,00:11:26.625,She's getting a sticker for sticking with it.
00:11:28.125,00:11:30.083,"-Thanks, Stickety Bot! -Bye bye!"
00:11:32.041,00:11:34.416,A rainbow sticker.
00:11:35.166,00:11:37.500,"Hey, big kids! Want to see my sticker?"
00:11:41.541,00:11:42.750,"Thank you, big kids."
00:00:14.666,00:00:15.708,Come on!
00:01:48.166,00:01:49.458,Beep-beep!
00:01:49.750,00:01:56.708,"Welcome to Bailey's Restaurant, home of the elephan-tastic shake!"
00:01:57.125,00:01:58.458,What can I get for you?
00:01:59.625,00:02:03.833,"Uh... a hamburger and a shake, please."
00:02:03.916,00:02:06.083,Ah! Excellent choice.
00:02:06.291,00:02:08.000,Coming right up.
00:02:09.000,00:02:12.708,Here's your burger and here's your shake.
00:02:19.750,00:02:23.125,It's time for Tilly to wake up from her nap.
00:02:23.208,00:02:24.708,-Already? -Yeah.
00:02:24.791,00:02:26.750,Let's get her!
00:02:26.833,00:02:28.708,Cheetah speed!
00:02:28.791,00:02:32.916,"Well, we'll get there faster if we take..."
00:02:33.125,00:02:35.083,the Bubble Train!
00:02:36.833,00:02:39.333,"Did I hear, the Bubble Train?"
00:02:39.416,00:02:43.250,You sure did. All aboard!
00:02:43.708,00:02:45.166,"Whoo, whoo!"
00:03:34.708,00:03:36.416,Let's play a game.
00:03:36.500,00:03:39.875,"Oh, okay, yeah! Um, we could play, uh..."
00:03:41.791,00:03:44.666,"What is it, Kip? Is something wrong?"
00:03:45.083,00:03:46.833,Look at... Look at that!
00:03:49.791,00:03:52.000,I can't believe it!
00:03:52.083,00:03:53.458,It's beautiful.
00:03:53.541,00:03:54.958,It's a...
00:03:56.208,00:03:57.458,box!
00:04:03.416,00:04:05.333,"Now that it's empty, you can play with it."
00:04:05.416,00:04:07.375,"Oh, yay!"
00:04:07.458,00:04:11.666,"Oh, I love playing with the box. Box is the best!"
00:04:11.750,00:04:13.625,What should we play?
00:04:15.916,00:04:18.166,-Airplane? -Race car?
00:04:19.208,00:04:22.083,"Pirate ship! Ha-ha, yeah!"
00:04:22.708,00:04:26.083,"Arr, matey, set sail in me trusty box!"
00:04:26.166,00:04:28.208,"I mean, uh, ship."
00:04:28.291,00:04:31.250,"Well, we always play pirates."
00:04:31.333,00:04:32.875,How about something else?
00:04:33.208,00:04:34.208,Uh...
00:04:34.291,00:04:36.708,But I like wearing hats.
00:04:37.208,00:04:38.625,"Please, Kip?"
00:04:38.708,00:04:40.875,"Oh, okay."
00:04:41.458,00:04:47.541,"Instead, we can pretend the box is our house and we're the family who lives there."
00:04:47.625,00:04:49.416,Yes! Family!
00:04:49.500,00:04:51.958,-I'll be the dad. -Bà Ba!
00:04:52.416,00:04:54.625,-I'll be the mom. -Mā ma!
00:04:55.166,00:04:58.000,And Tilly could be the baby.
00:04:58.083,00:05:00.458,I'll be her big sister.
00:05:00.541,00:05:01.625,Jiě jie.
00:05:02.458,00:05:05.625,And Raffe could be our pet dog!
00:05:06.250,00:05:07.750,"Right, Raffe?"
00:05:07.833,00:05:10.500,"Well, what about me, huh? What can I be?"
00:05:12.208,00:05:17.958,"You could be the mailman, because mailmen love boxes and they wear hats."
00:05:18.041,00:05:20.041,Uh... Okay.
00:05:20.125,00:05:22.666,"Well, I do love hats."
00:05:22.750,00:05:25.750,"So, let's make the house!"
00:05:31.250,00:05:33.708,I made you lunch to take to work.
00:05:34.000,00:05:36.541,A burger and a shake.
00:05:38.583,00:05:41.458,My favorite. Thanks for the shake!
00:05:42.416,00:05:44.916,-Off to my job. -Bye.
00:05:45.291,00:05:47.041,"Bye, children, see you later."
00:05:47.875,00:05:48.708,Zàijiàn!
00:05:49.791,00:05:52.875,"Okay, Raffe, fetch."
00:05:55.875,00:05:56.958,Good dog.
00:05:57.541,00:05:59.916,"Hello, I'm the mailman."
00:06:00.000,00:06:02.333,Here to deliver your mail.
00:06:02.958,00:06:05.333,"You have letters, Mr. Mailman?"
00:06:05.416,00:06:07.666,Uh... Oh.
00:06:08.416,00:06:09.791,Be right back!
00:06:10.708,00:06:12.958,Hello! I am the mailman.
00:06:13.041,00:06:15.166,Here to deliver your mail.
00:06:15.250,00:06:17.958,"-Hi, Mailman. -N ho."
00:06:18.583,00:06:21.083,-Hi there! -N ho.
00:06:24.541,00:06:27.666,"-Hello? -Hi, Mister. Here's your mail."
00:06:28.583,00:06:31.625,"Oh, gee, thank you, Mr. Mailman."
00:06:31.708,00:06:34.250,"Wow, it's so cool in there."
00:06:34.833,00:06:36.916,-Can I come in? -Kippie...
00:06:37.000,00:06:39.416,Mailmen don't go in the house.
00:06:39.500,00:06:41.958,Uh... They don't?
00:06:42.041,00:06:46.166,"Yeah, the house is for the family. It's where we live."
00:06:46.833,00:06:50.166,"Well, then, I want to be a part of the family."
00:06:50.583,00:06:53.416,Mailmen are not in the family.
00:06:53.500,00:06:55.791,But... I want to be.
00:06:55.875,00:06:58.666,"-No, sorry. -What? Yes!"
00:06:59.041,00:07:00.166,-No. -Yes.
00:07:00.250,00:07:01.166,-No! -Yes!
00:07:01.250,00:07:02.250,-No! -Yes!
00:07:04.291,00:07:07.166,"Um, guys, please don't fight."
00:07:07.458,00:07:09.208,It's not nice to fight.
00:07:09.458,00:07:12.000,"Yeah, we shouldn't fight, children."
00:07:12.500,00:07:13.416,And mailman.
00:07:35.583,00:07:37.125,"-I didn't do that! -Yes, you did!"
00:07:37.208,00:07:38.625,-Did not! -Did too!
00:07:38.708,00:07:40.750,-Did not! No! I... -Did!
00:07:40.833,00:07:43.708,"-Um, you guys are fighting. -Oops, sorry, Lulu."
00:07:43.791,00:07:45.208,"Sorry, Kippie."
00:08:01.750,00:08:03.208,"I'm sorry, Kippie."
00:08:03.875,00:08:05.958,You don't have to be the mailman.
00:08:06.041,00:08:07.916,You could be in the family.
00:08:08.375,00:08:09.791,Who will I be?
00:08:09.875,00:08:16.291,"I mean, we already have a momma and a dad, and a sister and a baby."
00:08:17.166,00:08:18.375,"I know, Kip!"
00:08:18.458,00:08:20.083,You can be the...
00:08:21.041,00:08:24.458,"well, it's like a sister, but a boy."
00:08:24.541,00:08:26.916,"Um, what's the word for that?"
00:08:28.166,00:08:29.416,I don't know.
00:08:30.000,00:08:32.750,But I know who does.
00:08:41.166,00:08:42.666,"Come, come!"
00:08:48.041,00:08:49.291,English and Mandarin.
00:08:49.375,00:08:52.166,I need your help. I want to be in the family.
00:08:54.416,00:08:57.833,"Oh, that's who I was. That's the..."
00:09:04.958,00:09:06.291,Mā ma!
00:09:06.375,00:09:09.916,Mā ma! Sounds a lot like mom.
00:09:13.458,00:09:17.083,"Oh, and that was me. I was the..."
00:09:23.833,00:09:25.500,Bà Ba!
00:09:25.583,00:09:28.291,It's fun being the Bà Ba!
00:09:30.791,00:09:33.500,And that's me. I was the...
00:09:40.250,00:09:41.291,Jiě Jie.
00:09:42.666,00:09:46.041,Jiě Jie means big sister.
00:09:46.125,00:09:47.916,A sister is a girl.
00:09:50.708,00:09:54.333,"Oh, that's the boy in the family. That's who I want to be."
00:09:54.708,00:09:56.208,"What's that word, big kids?"
00:10:04.291,00:10:05.208,Gē ge!
00:10:05.750,00:10:10.583,"Oh, yay! I can be the big brother. I'm part of the family."
00:10:10.666,00:10:13.541,Yeah! This calls for a...
00:10:32.375,00:10:34.208,-Mom! -Mā ma!
00:10:35.083,00:10:36.916,-Dad! -Bà Ba!
00:10:37.833,00:10:39.583,-Sister! -Jiě Jie!
00:10:40.416,00:10:42.000,-Brother! -Gē ge!
00:11:03.791,00:11:06.458,"Excuse me, can I come in now?"
00:11:06.541,00:11:09.000,"Come on in, brother."
00:11:09.083,00:11:10.750,"Thank you, sister."
00:11:11.208,00:11:13.583,"Oh, boy! What a cool house."
00:11:13.666,00:11:15.375,Can we make it dance?
00:11:19.625,00:11:22.333,Our children are so silly.
00:11:22.416,00:11:25.583,Yep. They get that from your side.
00:11:28.000,00:11:29.208,-Yeah! -Yeah!
00:11:29.291,00:11:30.958,We're a dancing house!
00:11:31.416,00:11:32.833,Dance this way.
00:11:32.916,00:11:35.583,Dance that way... Woo hoo!
00:11:35.666,00:11:37.208,I like it!
00:11:37.583,00:11:39.041,"Bye, big kids!"
00:11:39.125,00:11:41.666,Say hi to your family from us.
00:11:41.750,00:11:44.708,"-Bye, bye! -See you soon!"
00:11:47.458,00:11:49.083,Zàijiàn!
00:00:14.625,00:00:15.666,Come on!
00:00:50.958,00:00:53.208,Mmm! Sweet!
00:00:53.916,00:00:55.416,"Smell, Tilly."
00:01:10.083,00:01:11.833,Franny likes quiet time too.
00:01:13.166,00:01:15.208,"Oh, hi, big kids."
00:01:26.916,00:01:28.166,"-Um... -Yeah, Bailey?"
00:01:28.250,00:01:32.666,Maybe your quiet singing could be a little more quiet.
00:01:33.166,00:01:34.583,"You got it, buddy."
00:01:41.416,00:01:42.666,"I love it, too."
00:02:37.375,00:02:39.041,"Oh, hi, Tilly."
00:02:46.458,00:02:47.791,"Oh, that's the sun."
00:02:48.166,00:02:49.208,Tài yáng?
00:02:49.958,00:02:50.791,Oh.
00:02:51.166,00:02:54.250,Tài yáng must mean sun in Mandarin.
00:02:55.166,00:02:57.625,The sun is so warm-- Tài yáng!
00:02:58.166,00:02:59.166,Tài yáng!
00:03:00.208,00:03:03.708,Tilly. Do you want to go up to the sun?
00:03:05.666,00:03:08.166,I don't think we can go all the way up there.
00:03:08.250,00:03:10.583,"Actually, we can!"
00:03:11.000,00:03:14.625,All we need is our imagination.
00:03:14.708,00:03:16.791,"Oh, and my rocket!"
00:03:17.708,00:03:19.875,Kip has a very fast rocket.
00:03:20.291,00:03:23.291,"-Let's go! -Yeah, let's go!"
00:03:46.166,00:03:50.500,Captain Kip is ready for take-off!
00:03:50.583,00:03:53.750,"Astronaut Bailey, are you ready?"
00:03:54.000,00:03:55.291,Ready!
00:03:55.750,00:03:58.875,"Astronaut Tilly, are you ready?"
00:04:00.500,00:04:03.541,"Mission Control, are you ready?"
00:04:04.083,00:04:05.083,-Ready! -Ready!
00:04:05.166,00:04:07.666,"Then let's go, go, go!"
00:04:07.750,00:04:11.833,And remember to use your imagination.
00:04:52.875,00:04:54.583,Let's explore.
00:05:01.791,00:05:04.208,It's so pretty out here.
00:05:05.500,00:05:06.916,And quiet.
00:05:16.083,00:05:18.000,"Well, not that quiet."
00:05:21.333,00:05:22.583,The sun!
00:05:26.250,00:05:27.583,Tài yáng!
00:05:31.000,00:05:34.500,The sun feels so warm and cozy.
00:05:37.833,00:05:40.875,"The sun is very, very hot."
00:05:41.291,00:05:43.416,Please do not get too close.
00:05:44.750,00:05:46.000,Careful!
00:05:47.250,00:05:49.000,"Oh, you're right."
00:05:49.083,00:05:50.375,Thank you!
00:05:52.125,00:05:53.875,"We'd better go this way, Tilly."
00:06:00.166,00:06:01.708,Peek-a-pop!
00:06:08.041,00:06:09.041,"Come on, Tilly."
00:06:09.125,00:06:10.791,Let's go explore over there.
00:06:20.791,00:06:21.916,Yuè liàng!
00:06:25.625,00:06:26.875,The moon?
00:06:36.625,00:06:37.666,Oh!
00:06:38.166,00:06:40.666,That must be how you say moon in Mandarin.
00:06:41.666,00:06:45.125,"And let me tell you, it is not made of cheese."
00:06:45.208,00:06:46.916,Ugh! Yuck!
00:06:51.708,00:06:53.500,My turn to push button!
00:06:53.583,00:06:56.041,"-No, it's my turn. -My turn!"
00:06:56.708,00:06:58.208,-It's my turn. -My turn!
00:06:58.291,00:06:59.750,-My turn! -Mine!
00:07:05.291,00:07:06.916,It's not nice to fight.
00:07:32.250,00:07:33.833,-I didn't do that! -Yes you did!
00:07:33.916,00:07:35.291,-Did not! -Did too!
00:07:35.375,00:07:36.625,-Did not! -Did!
00:07:36.708,00:07:37.541,No! I...
00:07:37.625,00:07:40.375,"-Um, you guys are fighting. -Oops, sorry, Lulu."
00:07:40.458,00:07:41.875,"Sorry, Kippie."
00:07:58.625,00:08:00.125,"I'm sorry, Lulu."
00:08:00.791,00:08:01.958,"Sorry, Franny."
00:08:02.041,00:08:04.000,"You should get a turn, now."
00:08:04.083,00:08:08.666,Why don't you push the buttons to bring our rocket home?
00:08:12.458,00:08:14.208,"Come home, now!"
00:08:15.291,00:08:18.041,"Beep, beep, boop, boop."
00:08:28.125,00:08:29.333,Oh! I see it!
00:08:29.416,00:08:30.666,Over there!
00:08:34.916,00:08:37.000,"Yeah, but I don't know what it is."
00:08:37.750,00:08:40.333,Captain Kip? Do you know the word for that?
00:08:42.625,00:08:44.250,Word Wally!
00:08:57.958,00:08:58.958,Copy that.
00:09:02.291,00:09:03.583,English and Mandarin.
00:09:04.041,00:09:05.291,You help!
00:09:09.458,00:09:12.666,That's what keeps us all warm and cozy.
00:09:13.291,00:09:14.208,It's the...
00:09:20.541,00:09:22.166,Tài yáng.
00:09:23.000,00:09:25.708,Tài yáng is the sun.
00:09:26.041,00:09:26.875,Yeah.
00:09:28.833,00:09:32.375,"Oh, that's what we see in the sky at night."
00:09:32.458,00:09:34.166,"What's that word, big kids?"
00:09:41.083,00:09:42.708,Yuè liàng.
00:09:43.750,00:09:46.125,Yuè liàng is the moon.
00:09:50.791,00:09:54.041,"Oh, that's what we just saw from our rocket."
00:09:54.125,00:09:55.500,"What's it called, big kids?"
00:10:02.666,00:10:04.750,Dì qiú.
00:10:04.833,00:10:07.958,Dì qiú is the Earth!
00:10:08.041,00:10:10.416,And it sure is beautiful.
00:10:11.125,00:10:12.541,This calls for a...
00:10:16.500,00:10:19.041,"And friends, let's..."
00:10:20.000,00:10:21.916,rock it!
00:10:38.291,00:10:40.166,-Sun! -Tài yáng!
00:10:40.875,00:10:42.958,-Moon! -Yuè liàng!
00:10:43.708,00:10:45.666,-Earth! -Dì qiú!
00:11:19.875,00:11:22.625,I loved visiting the sun and moon today.
00:11:23.375,00:11:31.458,"But I think my favorite place is right here on the Earth, sitting under my favorite tree with you, Tilly."
00:11:35.166,00:11:37.333,"And with you, too, big kids."
00:11:37.708,00:11:38.875,Love you.
00:00:14.708,00:00:15.958,Come on!
00:00:53.958,00:00:55.250,Cheetah speed!
00:00:55.875,00:00:58.125,"Faster, Franny, faster!"
00:01:02.625,00:01:05.416,Feels like flying. Whee!
00:01:06.041,00:01:07.708,I couldn't go that fast.
00:01:07.791,00:01:08.708,Too scary.
00:01:08.791,00:01:13.625,Nothing is too scary for Franny the Brave!
00:01:13.708,00:01:15.583,"Yep, I'm the bravest!"
00:01:20.750,00:01:23.166,Franny the Brave is okay!
00:01:23.791,00:01:26.083,"Sorry, Franny. I didn't see you because..."
00:01:26.166,00:01:30.333,"Well, I was just so excited because they're here. They're here!"
00:01:30.416,00:01:32.625,"Oh boy, oh boy, they're here!"
00:01:33.375,00:01:34.791,"What is it, Kippie?"
00:01:35.250,00:01:38.333,Only the greatest thing in the world!
00:01:39.708,00:01:41.958,Toy dinosaurs.
00:01:45.250,00:01:49.416,"Well, I've seen dinosaurs before in my Snaily books."
00:01:49.500,00:01:50.625,They're really neat.
00:01:51.000,00:01:55.750,Yeah. Look at this one. It's called a Tyrannosaurus rex.
00:01:55.833,00:01:58.750,Oh! Ranno... Tyranno...
00:01:59.041,00:02:02.500,Ty-rann-o-saur-us Rex!
00:02:05.416,00:02:07.375,Bà wáng lóng.
00:02:07.458,00:02:09.375,"Uh, no, Tilly."
00:02:09.458,00:02:12.083,It's a Tyrannosaurus rex.
00:02:12.416,00:02:14.125,Bà wáng lóng.
00:02:15.208,00:02:16.458,A Tyrannosaurus rex.
00:02:16.541,00:02:21.375,"Kip, I think Tilly is saying Tyrannosaurus rex in Mandarin."
00:02:21.458,00:02:23.083,Oh. Oh!
00:02:23.166,00:02:24.458,"Yeah, Tilly."
00:02:24.541,00:02:26.833,Bà wáng lóng.
00:02:27.250,00:02:29.375,Bà wáng lóng!
00:02:29.916,00:02:32.291,-I want to play with the dinosaur. -Nuh-uh.
00:02:32.375,00:02:34.958,"Kip, it's important to share."
00:02:35.833,00:02:36.666,Uh.
00:02:37.125,00:02:38.666,"Yeah, okay."
00:02:39.416,00:02:42.166,"Oh, but first, say the magic word."
00:02:42.833,00:02:44.083,Noodle.
00:02:44.875,00:02:46.166,"No, that's not it."
00:02:46.250,00:02:47.833,Oh. Uh....
00:02:48.458,00:02:50.000,-Please? -That's it.
00:02:50.083,00:02:51.916,"Here you go, Lulu!"
00:02:54.583,00:02:58.208,"Big tail, pointy, pointy teeth..."
00:02:58.291,00:03:00.041,"Yeah, and he goes..."
00:03:06.500,00:03:07.916,Dinosaur eat.
00:03:08.583,00:03:10.916,"Chomp, chomp, chomp!"
00:03:17.958,00:03:20.166,Is there a different dinosaur?
00:03:20.958,00:03:23.125,One without pointy teeth?
00:03:23.625,00:03:25.666,Sure. There are lots in here.
00:03:27.833,00:03:28.916,Here's one.
00:03:30.833,00:03:32.375,It's a Triceratops.
00:03:32.458,00:03:34.916,This is my favorite dinosaur.
00:03:35.416,00:03:37.125,It doesn't have any pointy teeth.
00:03:37.416,00:03:38.875,What are those?
00:03:39.625,00:03:41.291,Those are its three big horns.
00:03:41.875,00:03:43.125,Aren't they neat?
00:03:43.458,00:03:45.833,They're very sharp and pointy.
00:03:46.583,00:03:48.875,Cool! A Triceratops!
00:03:50.416,00:03:52.333,Sān jio lóng.
00:03:54.291,00:03:58.458,We can pretend to be birds and fly on our scooters.
00:03:58.541,00:04:01.250,"Well, you did that already, Franny."
00:04:01.333,00:04:03.208,Let's play dinosaurs!
00:04:03.291,00:04:06.041,"Yeah! Okay, let's see. One for Tilly."
00:04:06.375,00:04:09.541,This is for you. And one for me.
00:04:09.625,00:04:11.708,And which one for Franny?
00:04:12.625,00:04:15.125,Or we could play a different game.
00:04:16.083,00:04:18.833,Lulu has a game. Lulu has a game!
00:04:18.916,00:04:19.958,What is it?
00:04:20.041,00:04:25.041,It's called Tyrannosaurus Chomp Chomp!
00:04:25.958,00:04:28.458,"You run, I chomp."
00:04:28.541,00:04:30.208,I don't think I want to...
00:04:30.291,00:04:32.083,"-Chomp, chomp! -Wait. I didn't..."
00:04:52.500,00:04:56.750,They're scary and I don't want to play with them.
00:05:00.333,00:05:01.750,-Franny! -Franny?
00:05:01.833,00:05:03.625,"-Oh, no. -We'd better go help."
00:05:03.708,00:05:04.541,Yeah.
00:05:14.916,00:05:17.166,"Are you okay, Franny?"
00:05:17.250,00:05:20.750,"Yeah, you don't have to play dinosaurs if you don't want to."
00:05:21.375,00:05:23.291,Why don't you like dinosaurs?
00:05:23.375,00:05:27.166,"I'm a teeny, tiny bit afraid of them."
00:05:27.666,00:05:29.708,But you're Brave Franny.
00:05:30.375,00:05:33.125,Franny doesn't have to be brave all the time.
00:05:34.125,00:05:35.291,I guess.
00:05:38.333,00:05:40.833,"Oh! I know how to cheer you up, Franny."
00:05:41.125,00:05:41.958,How?
00:05:42.041,00:05:45.333,We can dance to a happy place!
00:05:46.875,00:05:48.958,"-Okay. -Yeah, come on."
00:05:53.250,00:05:55.166,"You dance too, big kids."
00:06:27.708,00:06:53.375,"-Get snappy -And get clappy You don't have to worry, Franny."
00:06:53.791,00:06:56.750,"Dinosaurs were here a long, long time ago."
00:06:57.333,00:06:59.083,"They're not here, now."
00:06:59.166,00:07:00.500,Oh!
00:07:01.000,00:07:03.083,"I guess that's not so scary, then."
00:07:03.166,00:07:04.625,Look at the different kinds.
00:07:06.708,00:07:09.000,There's even one that...
00:07:10.291,00:07:11.708,Flies!
00:07:12.166,00:07:14.291,That one is flying!
00:07:14.375,00:07:16.250,Just like me on my scooter!
00:07:16.708,00:07:18.000,What's it called?
00:07:18.083,00:07:20.000,"Oh, that one? That's a..."
00:07:20.416,00:07:23.291,A... I don't remember.
00:07:24.291,00:07:25.416,Oh.
00:07:27.041,00:07:28.333,Let's ask Word Wally.
00:07:39.625,00:07:40.708,"Come on, Tilly."
00:07:45.666,00:07:47.041,English and Mandarin.
00:07:47.125,00:07:49.500,This is going to be so cool.
00:07:52.083,00:07:54.041,That one has pointy teeth.
00:07:54.125,00:07:56.708,"What's that called, big kids?"
00:08:03.916,00:08:05.666,Bà wáng lóng.
00:08:06.250,00:08:08.458,"Chomp, chomp, chomp!"
00:08:09.208,00:08:12.583,"Oh, oops! Sorry, Franny. Sorry."
00:08:12.666,00:08:13.791,It's okay.
00:08:17.583,00:08:22.291,"That dinosaur has three big horns. What's it called, big kids?"
00:08:29.250,00:08:31.333,Sān jio lóng.
00:08:32.416,00:08:36.041,Sān jio lóng means Triceratops.
00:08:39.791,00:08:42.833,Look! That's the one that flies.
00:08:42.916,00:08:44.083,What's the name of that?
00:08:48.875,00:08:52.416,Pterodactyl! Yay!
00:08:55.125,00:08:57.625,Yì shu lóng.
00:08:57.958,00:09:01.041,Yì shu lóng means Pterodactyl.
00:09:01.125,00:09:04.958,"Oh! I want to play with the Pterodactyl, right now!"
00:09:05.041,00:09:08.500,"Oh, cool! But first we need a..."
00:09:25.625,00:09:28.416,-Tyrannosaurus rex! -Bà wáng lóng!

00:09:33.666,00:09:36.333,-Pterodactyl! -Yì shu lóng!
00:09:59.458,00:10:02.416,Oh! There's no Pterodactyl.
00:10:02.500,00:10:05.291,"Well, I guess we don't have that one."
00:10:11.083,00:10:14.125,"The Whatsit Toy always has what you need, when you need it."
00:11:09.958,00:11:12.125,A Pterodactyl!
00:11:12.208,00:11:13.833,"Thanks, Whatsit Toy!"
00:11:16.458,00:11:17.583,Wow!
00:11:20.250,00:11:22.291,Hmm...
00:11:26.041,00:11:29.291,I'm flying with my Pterodactyl!
00:11:32.583,00:11:35.416,"Thanks for helping me be brave, big kids."
00:11:35.500,00:11:36.333,Love you!
00:11:40.958,00:11:42.916,Whee!
00:00:53.583,00:00:55.041,But where are they?
00:00:55.333,00:00:56.958,"Hey, big kids."
00:00:57.333,00:00:59.083,We're playing hide-and-seek.
00:00:59.166,00:01:02.250,I'm it and I found everyone.
00:01:02.333,00:01:04.875,Except Party-in-a-box.
00:01:05.416,00:01:08.958,"-Yeah, Party-in-a-box is a good hider! -Yeah!"
00:01:12.500,00:01:15.791,"No, Lulu. We haven't finished hide-and-seek yet."
00:01:15.875,00:01:18.083,But I want to be the leader.
00:01:18.666,00:01:22.750,"You will, I promise. Just as soon as we find Party-in-a-box."
00:01:23.375,00:01:25.666,"Big kids, will you help us?"
00:01:27.791,00:01:31.000,Do you see Party-in-a-box anywhere?
00:01:33.916,00:01:35.625,What? Did you see him?
00:01:42.791,00:01:45.875,Follow me. Cheetah speed!
00:01:48.666,00:01:50.875,They always follow Franny.
00:01:51.083,00:01:52.750,But I want to be the leader.
00:01:53.500,00:01:54.333,My turn.
00:01:58.875,00:02:00.833,Have you seen Party-in-a-box?
00:02:00.916,00:02:08.791,"Oh, sure. He's a little red box with a big button you push, and-- No, no! I mean, have you seen him today?"
00:02:09.166,00:02:10.208,Oh.
00:02:11.958,00:02:13.333,-No. -Oh.
00:02:13.916,00:02:17.500,"You'll find Party-in-a-box. Is it time for Follow the Leader, now?"
00:02:17.583,00:02:19.208,"Not yet, Lulu."
00:02:19.291,00:02:23.291,But he must be around here somewhere.
00:02:24.500,00:02:25.333,Ah!
00:02:29.333,00:02:31.375,"You come help us, Bail-Bail?"
00:02:31.458,00:02:34.333,"Oh, no, you go ahead. I'll play later."
00:02:35.833,00:02:40.833,"I'm happy sitting here right now, under my favorite tree."
00:03:36.416,00:03:39.583,Where is Party-in-a-box?
00:03:39.666,00:03:42.416,"Hey, hey! I know how to get him out of his hiding place."
00:03:52.833,00:03:57.250,"Yeah, I would love to have a party!"
00:03:57.333,00:03:59.666,"Party, party, party!"
00:04:18.958,00:04:22.208,"Clickety Clock! What time is it, big kids?"
00:04:28.666,00:04:31.500,"Oh, good, because I am hungry!"
00:04:31.583,00:04:34.125,But what about Follow the Leader?
00:04:34.208,00:04:37.833,"I get to be the leader, remember? You said."
00:04:38.958,00:04:42.458,"Oh. Sorry, Lulu, but it's time to eat."
00:04:42.541,00:04:45.041,"We'll play later, okay? Come on."
00:04:47.416,00:04:48.541,Okay.
00:04:49.416,00:04:50.416,I guess.
00:04:56.333,00:04:58.583,It is lunchtime.
00:04:58.666,00:05:01.125,So what should we eat?
00:05:01.500,00:05:05.666,I want something that is nice and warm and yummy.
00:05:05.750,00:05:08.625,Okay. Nice and warm and yum...
00:05:08.708,00:05:11.750,"Oh, Franny, Franny, I know."
00:05:11.833,00:05:14.083,"Okay, what should we eat?"
00:05:20.916,00:05:22.958,And what food is that?
00:05:23.041,00:05:27.333,"I think I know! And you're going to sing about it, right?"
00:05:27.750,00:05:28.750,Yes.
00:05:28.833,00:05:29.916,"Yes, I am."
00:06:28.333,00:06:31.916,"Yeah, noodles are good, but how about rice?"
00:06:32.375,00:06:35.833,"Oh, I like rice. It's nice and warm."
00:06:36.166,00:06:37.375,Noodles are warm.
00:06:38.083,00:06:39.083,"Well, that's true."
00:06:39.166,00:06:40.625,I like noodles too.
00:06:40.708,00:06:43.083,This is really a win-win for me.
00:06:43.666,00:06:46.541,We always have noodles. I want rice.
00:06:46.916,00:06:51.458,"Well, we can't eat lunch until we decide what to eat, so which is it?"
00:06:52.000,00:06:53.583,-Noodles. -Rice.
00:06:53.666,00:06:55.375,-Noodles! -Rice!
00:06:55.791,00:06:59.500,"You know, Lulu, we do eat noodles an awful lot."
00:06:59.583,00:07:02.041,"Maybe today, we could eat rice?"
00:07:02.875,00:07:05.166,"I never get what I want, today."
00:07:05.250,00:07:10.125,"No Follow the Leader, no noodles, no nothing."
00:07:14.041,00:07:16.750,I have a way to make everyone happy.
00:07:16.833,00:07:18.500,"What is it, Chef Franny?"
00:07:18.791,00:07:22.041,I know a food that's nice and warm.
00:07:22.125,00:07:25.916,-Yes? -And it could be eaten with rice.
00:07:26.000,00:07:28.291,-Yes? -Or noodles.
00:07:28.375,00:07:29.333,Yes?
00:07:30.125,00:07:32.375,"-Well, what is it? -It's called..."
00:07:33.875,00:07:34.958,Uh...
00:07:35.041,00:07:38.000,"Oh, I can't remember what it's called."
00:07:38.083,00:07:40.291,"I'm the chef, I should know."
00:07:40.833,00:07:42.666,"Well, that's okay, Franny."
00:07:42.750,00:07:45.583,"If you can't remember the word, we can call..."
00:07:54.708,00:07:58.250,"Come on, big kids. Let's figure this out quick so we can eat."
00:07:58.333,00:07:59.583,Cheetah speed!
00:08:04.083,00:08:05.458,English and Mandarin.
00:08:05.541,00:08:08.500,"You help us. Go, go!"
00:08:10.875,00:08:14.625,"Oh, I love that food. What's the word for that, big kids?"
00:08:22.041,00:08:22.875,Fàn.
00:08:24.333,00:08:26.208,Fàn means rice.
00:08:29.458,00:08:32.833,That's the best food in the whole wide world!
00:08:32.916,00:08:34.208,What's that word?
00:08:43.375,00:08:45.250,I love Miàn.
00:08:48.500,00:08:51.625,Oh! That's the food I was trying to think of.
00:08:51.708,00:08:56.416,"It's warm and can have rice, or noodles."
00:08:56.500,00:08:58.208,"What's the word for that, big kids?"
00:09:06.083,00:09:07.041,Tāng!
00:09:07.750,00:09:11.250,Tāng means soup. That looks good!
00:09:11.875,00:09:15.916,"Now I can make soup, so everyone gets what they want."
00:09:16.500,00:09:18.583,This calls for a...
00:09:23.416,00:09:24.833,Yee-ha!
00:09:38.000,00:09:39.500,-Rice! -Fàn!
00:09:40.500,00:09:42.000,-Noodles! -Miàn!
00:09:43.125,00:09:44.666,-Soup. -Tāng!
00:10:02.208,00:10:03.583,Mm-hmm!
00:10:03.666,00:10:07.916,"Franny, this is some good soup, full of yummy rice."
00:10:08.541,00:10:10.875,And mine with noodles.
00:10:10.958,00:10:13.000,Ha! Just what I like.
00:10:13.083,00:10:15.500,Franny is a souper chef!
00:10:36.458,00:10:38.041,Am I getting a sticker?
00:10:39.708,00:10:43.291,for making sure all of her friends had a great lunch today.
00:10:44.791,00:10:48.291,"A fork and a spoon, for my chart!"
00:10:48.875,00:10:51.291,Perfect for a souper chef!
00:10:54.000,00:10:55.541,"Thanks, Sticketybot."
00:10:57.458,00:10:58.416,Ha!
00:11:01.458,00:11:02.458,There!
00:11:03.333,00:11:06.083,"Well, lunch is done. What should we do next?"
00:11:06.583,00:11:12.416,"Well, I promised someone that we were going to play Follow the Leader."
00:11:12.500,00:11:13.750,So...
00:11:13.833,00:11:16.166,Really? Now?
00:11:16.250,00:11:18.916,"-Yeah! -Oh, Franny!"
00:11:19.875,00:11:23.416,"-Yay! -After you, leader."
00:11:23.666,00:11:30.250,"Follow me to the playroom, and walk like a noodle."
00:11:38.291,00:11:40.166,"Bye, big kids."
00:11:40.250,00:11:41.916,Thanks for your help today.
00:11:44.625,00:11:46.541,Got to go. Love you!
00:11:47.000,00:11:49.708,"Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle..."
00:00:14.708,00:00:15.750,Come on!
00:00:57.125,00:00:59.625,"What a delicious picnic, Tilly."
00:01:00.041,00:01:06.041,"We have sandwiches, juice boxes, and my favorite, apples!"
00:01:10.791,00:01:13.041,Oh! Tilly!
00:01:13.583,00:01:15.708,Those are pretend apples!
00:01:19.666,00:01:21.458,-Whoa! -Whoa!
00:01:21.541,00:01:24.791,"Howdy, cowpokes. Y'all having a picnic?"
00:01:25.500,00:01:26.375,Yep.
00:01:26.458,00:01:32.875,"I don't know about you, Hop-Along Kip, but my little old horsey would love an apple right about now."
00:01:32.958,00:01:35.041,"Right you are, Sheriff Franny!"
00:01:35.125,00:01:39.333,And my horsey sure would love some juice!
00:01:39.416,00:01:41.916,"Uh, do horses drink juice?"
00:01:42.000,00:01:45.333,"Uh, I don't think so, but we're just pretending."
00:01:53.291,00:01:54.125,"Chomp, chomp!"
00:01:57.416,00:01:59.666,I'm the new sheriff.
00:02:00.250,00:02:02.041,Sheriff Lulu.
00:02:03.333,00:02:08.375,And this is the fastest horsey in town.
00:02:09.208,00:02:13.083,Not faster than our horses.
00:02:13.541,00:02:17.333,"One way to find out, partner!"
00:02:18.041,00:02:19.041,Let's race.
00:02:19.416,00:02:21.000,-One... -Two...
00:02:21.083,00:02:22.041,Three...
00:02:45.333,00:02:47.041,Are you okay?
00:02:49.875,00:02:51.583,"Lulu, what's wrong?"
00:02:51.666,00:02:54.666,I bumped my elbow on the crib.
00:02:55.166,00:02:57.208,We were going too fast.
00:02:59.250,00:03:00.750,Bào bào.
00:03:01.625,00:03:04.541,I think Tilly wants to help.
00:03:10.750,00:03:14.416,Bào bào must mean hug in Mandarin.
00:03:17.458,00:03:19.375,"Do you feel better, Lulu?"
00:03:21.208,00:03:22.458,"Thanks, Tilly."
00:03:26.958,00:03:28.458,"What time is it, big kids?"
00:03:34.291,00:03:36.666,"Good, because I'm hungry as..."
00:03:36.916,00:03:38.916,"Well, a horse."
00:03:43.583,00:03:45.291,"Gallop, gallop..."
00:03:45.375,00:03:47.875,"Your elbow hurts too, Raffe?"
00:03:47.958,00:03:51.125,Here's a kiss to make you feel better.
00:03:53.250,00:03:54.333,Qīn qīn!
00:03:58.041,00:03:59.125,Qīn qīn!
00:03:59.208,00:04:02.208,Does that mean kiss in Mandarin?
00:04:02.750,00:04:05.875,"-Qīn qīn! -Oh, thanks, Tilly."
00:04:05.958,00:04:07.458,I feel better.
00:04:08.875,00:04:11.875,"Let's give the big kids kisses, too."
00:04:22.208,00:04:24.708,"-Qīn qīn! -Kiss, kiss!"
00:04:25.208,00:04:27.875,Oh! This is a big job!

00:05:22.500,00:05:28.416,This banana isn't big enough for the both of us.
00:05:28.500,00:05:29.791,Give me that banana!
00:05:29.875,00:05:32.083,"-No, give me the banana. -No, it's my banana."

00:06:25.166,00:06:26.666,"-I didn't do that! -Yes, you did!"
00:06:28.333,00:06:29.458,-Did not! -Did!

00:07:41.916,00:07:43.875,She doesn't understand the words.
00:07:44.541,00:07:47.958,I want Tilly to know that I love her.
00:08:00.500,00:08:02.000,"Come on, hurry."

00:01:00.875,00:01:03.375,"No, it's the opposite."
00:01:03.458,00:01:09.083,It's a super food that gives you super powers!

00:02:57.875,00:03:00.166,We don't need the super food to keep playing.
00:03:00.250,00:03:04.208,Let's be super heroes in the playroom!
00:03:04.291,00:03:05.666,"Great idea, Kip."

00:01:58.708,00:02:01.583,Tilly's in the water. Save her!
00:02:03.458,00:02:06.833,It's not really water. It's just our imagination.
00:02:10.666,00:02:14.583,And I'm imagining there's a giant storm!
00:02:19.791,00:02:23.041,But nothing will stop our pirate ship.
00:02:24.291,00:02:26.291,"Oh. Oh, no! What's that?"

00:03:39.791,00:03:41.250,"What time is it, big kids?"
00:03:47.416,00:03:50.833,"Yum, yum! Let's go inside to the kitchen."
00:03:51.458,00:03:54.041,"First, we need to put away our toys."
00:03:59.541,00:04:01.083,Let's pick them up!
00:04:20.125,00:04:22.875,"Now, let's put them in the playroom."
00:04:25.333,00:04:27.125,Right. Okay.
00:04:30.833,00:04:32.500,You forgot your hat.
00:04:32.583,00:04:34.666,What? No I didn't. It's right there.
00:04:34.750,00:04:36.333,"Well, you should..."
00:04:36.416,00:04:38.000,You should bring it inside.
00:04:38.083,00:04:41.875,"If you don't put away your toys, they could get lost."
00:04:41.958,00:04:43.250,Or broken.
00:04:45.125,00:04:46.583,Okay!
00:04:47.750,00:04:49.833,I guess I'll put it away.
00:04:54.875,00:04:56.791,There. All done.
00:04:56.875,00:05:00.666,"All right! Snack time! Yum, yum!"
00:05:01.791,00:05:04.291,"Um, where is the treasure chest?"
00:05:05.791,00:05:07.125,I don't see it.
00:05:07.208,00:05:09.333,Did we leave it outside?
00:05:09.416,00:05:12.708,Arr! The treasure be safe with Tilly! Let's eat.
00:05:14.041,00:05:16.125,"She doesn't have it, remember?"
00:05:16.833,00:05:18.583,We told her to hide the treasure.
00:05:19.125,00:05:21.375,The treasure chest is lost?
00:05:23.250,00:05:26.291,We can't have our snack until we put away all our toys.
00:05:29.791,00:05:32.250,-Then we better find it fast. -Yeah.
00:05:37.041,00:05:38.666,"What's wrong, Kip?"
00:05:40.666,00:05:42.291,Use your words.
00:05:43.375,00:05:45.208,My... My words?
00:06:34.958,00:06:39.583,"See, I'm hungry, and putting away our toys is not fun."
00:06:40.958,00:06:44.916,"Well, maybe we can make it fun with..."
00:06:45.375,00:06:47.250,a treasure hunt!
00:06:47.333,00:06:48.166,-Ooh! -Ha ha!
00:06:48.250,00:06:50.458,Pirates love treasure hunts!
00:06:50.791,00:06:52.583,That's right. I mean...
00:06:53.250,00:06:55.916,"Arr! That's right, matey!"
00:06:56.333,00:06:59.833,"So, where did you hide the treasure chest, Two-Eyed Tilly?"
00:07:02.166,00:07:03.416,Uh...
00:07:03.500,00:07:06.666,Where be the treasure? Arr!
00:07:07.125,00:07:08.541,Arr!
00:07:09.916,00:07:13.333,"Tilly, is the treasure inside or outside?"
00:07:16.125,00:07:18.541,"Tilly, inside?"
00:07:20.791,00:07:22.708,Or outside?
00:07:23.208,00:07:24.333,Mm-hmm.
00:07:24.750,00:07:26.833,"Tilly, it can't be both."
00:07:26.916,00:07:30.291,Inside and outside are opposites.
00:07:39.083,00:07:40.416,Forever?
00:07:46.625,00:07:48.125,We just need...
00:07:53.541,00:07:54.916,"Oh, yeah. Silly me."
00:07:56.416,00:07:58.125,Here he is. Wally!
00:08:03.291,00:08:04.416,English and Mandarin.
00:08:10.958,00:08:13.125,That's where we put away our toys.
00:08:13.208,00:08:15.166,"What's that called, big kids?"
00:08:20.333,00:08:24.750,We put away our toys inside the playroom.
00:08:34.291,00:08:36.666,That's where we played pirates.
00:08:36.750,00:08:38.500,"What's that called, big kids?"
00:08:43.416,00:08:46.000,"You sail on the high seas, outside."
00:08:48.666,00:08:50.166,Wài miàn.
00:08:54.666,00:08:58.916,"Ah. Inside and outside are what, big kids?"
00:09:06.250,00:09:07.833,Xiāng fn cí.
00:09:09.000,00:09:13.916,"Ah, that's right. Opposites, like up and down."
00:09:14.000,00:09:17.458,Or slow and fast!
00:09:19.458,00:09:21.583,"So where be the treasure, Tilly?"
00:09:21.666,00:09:24.416,Inside or outside?
00:09:24.500,00:09:29.000,L miàn or wài miàn?
00:09:30.416,00:09:31.750,Wài miàn.
00:09:32.458,00:09:35.208,The treasure is outside!
00:09:35.291,00:09:36.625,-Yay! -Let's go find it.
00:09:36.708,00:09:39.125,"Oh, not yet, Kippie."
00:10:01.666,00:10:03.750,-Inside! -L miàn!
00:10:04.208,00:10:06.458,-Outside! -Wài miàn!
00:10:06.541,00:10:09.458,And those are both opposites.
00:10:09.750,00:10:11.375,Xiāng fn cí!
00:10:31.333,00:10:35.333,"Okay, Tilly, where outside did you put the treasure chest?"
00:10:36.208,00:10:37.583,Mmm...
00:10:38.166,00:10:40.708,I don't think she remembers.
00:10:41.333,00:10:43.041,"Fear not, Bailey Bones."
00:10:43.125,00:10:45.416,Pirate Kip will find our treasure.
00:10:46.375,00:10:47.666,Let's see...
00:10:50.458,00:10:53.333,I see it! I see the treasure chest.
00:10:53.750,00:10:54.750,That way!
00:11:00.833,00:11:02.250,I found it.
00:11:07.750,00:11:09.791,Here be the treasure!
00:11:09.875,00:11:12.625,-Oh! Now we can have our snack. -Yes.
00:11:12.958,00:11:15.958,But after I put this away.
00:11:20.041,00:11:21.708,Inside the treasure chest.
00:11:22.291,00:11:23.875,Inside?
00:11:23.958,00:11:26.000,"-L miàn! -Yeah, let's see."
00:11:35.375,00:11:37.000,You can all have some.
00:11:37.583,00:11:39.208,"Thanks, big kids!"
00:11:39.541,00:11:40.375,Bye!
00:11:41.875,00:11:44.750,This be the best snack time ever!
00:00:52.791,00:00:55.708,"It's morning, yippee!"
00:00:55.791,00:00:57.000,-Shh! -Oh.
00:00:57.083,00:00:58.500,Tilly is still sleeping.
00:01:12.375,00:01:15.333,But I think my trunk is still asleep.
00:01:17.041,00:01:20.291,-Feels funny. -I know what will wake up your trunk.
00:01:20.375,00:01:23.083,A ride on the Bubble Train.
00:01:23.166,00:01:25.875,Bubble Train! Aboard!
00:01:28.166,00:01:30.791,We can ride until Tilly wakes up.
00:01:30.875,00:01:34.041,"-Oh, great idea, Kip. -Thanks."
00:01:36.958,00:01:38.000,Let's go.
00:01:44.500,00:01:46.250,"Bye-bye, Tilly."
00:02:45.625,00:02:47.458,"Oh, good morning, Tilly."
00:02:57.375,00:02:59.708,"You okay, Bail-Bail?"
00:03:00.041,00:03:03.500,I don't know. My trunk is all stuffy.
00:03:09.708,00:03:13.000,"Don't be scared, Tilly. It's just a little sneeze."
00:03:13.083,00:03:17.583,"Um, hey, Bailey, I think you're..."
00:03:18.125,00:03:18.958,sick.
00:03:25.916,00:03:29.250,"Well, maybe I am sick."
00:03:32.666,00:03:35.416,"And everyone should wash their hands so they don't get sick, too."
00:03:38.875,00:03:43.083,"We will take care of you, Bailey, so you can feel better really soon."
00:03:45.791,00:03:47.416,Clickety Clock!
00:03:47.875,00:03:50.166,"What time is it, big kids?"
00:03:58.500,00:04:01.625,"Hey, but first, let's wash our hands."
00:04:01.875,00:04:03.791,"Oh, good idea, Kip."
00:04:03.875,00:04:05.958,Ha! Thanks!
00:04:06.041,00:04:07.583,I'm full of them.
00:04:20.791,00:04:22.916,"You okay, Bail-Bail?"
00:04:23.708,00:04:25.958,I don't feel like eating.
00:04:26.041,00:04:29.833,But... apple sauce is your favorite.
00:04:30.208,00:04:31.875,"Yeah, I know."
00:04:31.958,00:04:33.750,I'm just not hungry.
00:04:37.375,00:04:38.833,Whatsit Toy!

00:04:41.416,00:04:44.500,Whatsit Toy always has what we need when we need it.
00:04:48.541,00:04:50.041,"Sorry, Whatsit."
00:04:54.000,00:04:55.166,What's that?
00:04:58.041,00:05:00.875,Medicine helps you get better when you're sick.
00:05:03.083,00:05:06.041,But this medicine smells icky.
00:05:06.125,00:05:08.083,Do I have to take it?
00:05:11.916,00:05:14.208,"Well, I do want to feel better."
00:05:14.875,00:05:17.083,"We want you to feel better, too."
00:05:23.875,00:05:26.541,Mmm! Tastes like grapes!
00:05:28.333,00:05:31.791,"-Now you feel better soon! -Thanks, Whatsit!"
00:05:32.458,00:05:33.666,-Bye-bye! -Bye!

00:06:20.833,00:06:23.875,-Snaily will rest with you. -Oh!
00:06:24.541,00:06:26.083,"Thank you, Lulu."
00:06:26.166,00:06:28.666,"Ooh, ooh! I know what will help you rest."
00:06:28.750,00:06:30.166,A joke!
00:06:30.250,00:06:33.416,-Oh. -Hmm. Let me think of one.
00:06:33.500,00:06:35.166,"Oh, I got it! Okay."
00:06:35.250,00:06:39.625,What do you call a dinosaur that's asleep?
00:06:39.958,00:06:42.583,"-I don't know. -I don't know, Kip."
00:06:43.208,00:06:45.958,A dino-snore!
00:06:47.625,00:06:49.625,-Yeah. -I get it.

00:06:57.458,00:06:59.416,"Oh, thank you, Tilly."
00:06:59.500,00:07:01.333,I love my heart pillow...
00:07:01.416,00:07:03.125,Oh. Oh...
00:07:07.791,00:07:09.583,"Could I have my pillow, please?"
00:07:11.541,00:07:12.916,Oh.
00:07:13.000,00:07:16.041,I think my sneezes are scaring Tilly.

00:07:35.458,00:07:37.375,"Oh, I don't think that's going to..."
00:07:45.833,00:07:49.208,"You should stay in bed, Bailey, since you feel sick."
00:07:49.291,00:07:51.875,"-Okay. -But you come, big kids."
00:07:51.958,00:07:53.333,We need you.
00:07:57.625,00:07:59.083,English and Mandarin.
00:07:59.166,00:08:01.458,"You help too, big kids!"
00:08:03.625,00:08:08.166,"Oh, that's what Bailey's doing. It's called a..."
00:08:14.208,00:08:16.708,D pēn tì!
00:08:18.708,00:08:20.208,"That's right, Tilly."
00:08:20.666,00:08:24.416,D pēn tì means sneeze.
00:08:26.625,00:08:31.583,"Uh-oh, that's like Bail-Bail. What's that word, big kids?"
00:08:38.000,00:08:40.250,-Shēng bìng! -Yes.
00:08:41.083,00:08:44.750,Shēng bìng means sick in Mandarin.
00:08:44.833,00:08:48.750,"And sometimes when you're sick, you sneeze."
00:08:53.583,00:08:55.416,"What is it, big kids?"
00:09:01.125,00:09:02.583,Yào!
00:09:02.666,00:09:07.125,Yào means medicine. To help you feel better.
00:09:08.291,00:09:11.041,"Oh, look! Now she's not sick."
00:09:11.458,00:09:13.458,"What's the word for that, big kids?"
00:09:19.500,00:09:21.000,Jiàn kāng!
00:09:21.875,00:09:24.000,Jiàn kāng means healthy.
00:09:29.375,00:09:31.041,The medicine's working.
00:09:31.125,00:09:32.958,"I feel better, see?"
00:09:36.375,00:09:37.875,"That's great, Bailey."
00:09:37.958,00:09:41.375,Do you feel good enough for a...
00:09:44.458,00:09:46.208,"Yes, I do!"
00:10:02.458,00:10:03.916,-Medicine! -Yào!

00:10:46.000,00:10:48.083,"Oh, that's right, Tilly. Sneeze."
00:10:48.708,00:10:54.166,"I'm glad you're feeling better, Bailey, but I don't think you're all the way healthy yet."
00:10:54.666,00:10:58.291,"Well, I do still feel tired and sniffly."
00:11:06.875,00:11:11.041,"It's time for you to take a nap, so you can rest and get healthy."
00:11:12.916,00:11:14.708,"Night-night, Bail-Bail."
00:11:17.208,00:11:20.541,Thank you for taking such good care of me.
00:11:20.625,00:11:23.291,"Aw! We'll always take care of you, Bailey."
00:11:26.375,00:11:27.291,Oh!
00:11:27.916,00:11:29.500,"Thank you, Tilly."
00:11:30.583,00:11:33.333,-Jiàn kāng. -Yeah.
00:11:34.791,00:11:36.875,I'll be healthy soon.
00:11:48.916,00:11:50.375,Shh!
00:00:55.708,00:00:56.916,Where are they?
00:00:59.125,00:01:00.250,Hello!
00:01:04.041,00:01:07.750,"Whoo, whoo, whoo!"
00:01:09.166,00:01:11.916,"Ya, ya, ya!"
00:01:14.250,00:01:16.583,We’re being silly with our faces!
00:01:18.291,00:01:19.916,Silly nose.
00:01:24.125,00:01:25.416,Silly eyes!
00:01:34.875,00:01:37.666,"Hey, maybe we should silly dance, too."
00:01:37.750,00:01:41.666,"Yeah! Hey, do you want to dance with us?"
00:02:54.291,00:02:56.875,"Oh, hey, look! Tilly's up from her nap."
00:03:04.666,00:03:06.916,"You're good at being silly, Tilly."
00:03:08.000,00:03:11.041,"Lulu's silly, too. Watch, watch."
00:03:17.458,00:03:19.208,"What time is it, big kids?"
00:03:26.541,00:03:29.208,Let's go. Tilly must be hungry.
00:03:29.291,00:03:32.750,"Wait! Lulu's hungry, too."
00:03:35.833,00:03:37.208,That was yummy.
00:03:37.916,00:03:39.083,"Oh, Tilly!"
00:03:45.375,00:03:46.208,See?
00:03:53.208,00:03:55.375,And you're a good clapper!
00:03:56.583,00:03:59.166,"I'm a good clapper, too."
00:04:00.750,00:04:03.125,"Oh! Hey, Tilly wants to play."
00:04:03.208,00:04:04.791,"Can we go play, now?"
00:04:31.916,00:04:34.875,Can we please play in the playroom?
00:04:40.958,00:04:42.250,Move!
00:05:15.625,00:05:17.875,I'll give you another kiss right here.
00:05:19.458,00:05:22.416,"-Let's go, Lulu. Let's go. -Oh, okay."
00:05:26.416,00:05:28.958,Does someone want to play with Lulu?
00:05:29.041,00:05:32.583,"Oh, hi, Lulu! Hey, look at Tilly rock!"
00:05:33.041,00:05:35.541,"Uh, yes. Good. But..."
00:05:36.666,00:05:38.833,Lulu plays the xylophone.
00:05:39.333,00:05:43.000,"Well, right. But Tilly's rockin' it!"
00:05:44.958,00:05:46.875,Lulu plays the xylophone.
00:05:48.125,00:05:49.583,"You sure do, Lulu."
00:05:49.666,00:05:53.708,"But, um, maybe you could try something else, right now."
00:06:03.833,00:06:05.416,"Hey, Raffe."
00:06:10.541,00:06:13.791,Do you like my picture of Tilly? She's so cute!
00:06:18.041,00:06:19.041,What's wrong?
00:06:20.416,00:06:21.583,It's just that...
00:06:22.208,00:06:25.083,Everyone likes Tilly better than Lulu.
00:06:25.958,00:06:27.291,What?
00:06:27.375,00:06:28.958,That's not true.
00:06:29.041,00:06:30.541,We love you.
00:06:31.708,00:06:34.166,But you're painting a picture of Tilly.
00:06:34.541,00:06:36.833,And... not me.
00:06:37.791,00:06:39.541,Oh.
00:06:40.708,00:06:42.333,Well...
00:06:42.416,00:06:46.375,"I'd love to paint a picture of you, right now."
00:06:47.708,00:06:49.000,Really?
00:06:49.083,00:06:50.208,Sure!
00:06:50.541,00:06:52.916,Stand right over there.
00:06:53.000,00:06:54.666,-Here? -Yeah.
00:06:54.750,00:06:56.166,Okay.
00:07:05.583,00:07:07.625,Hold still. Artist at work.
00:07:07.708,00:07:09.291,Uh...
00:07:09.375,00:07:10.583,Okay.
00:07:13.541,00:07:15.583,Eyes...
00:07:15.666,00:07:17.208,Check.
00:07:17.291,00:07:18.791,Nose...
00:07:19.458,00:07:20.500,Check.
00:07:26.875,00:07:28.833,What a great picture of Tilly!
00:07:28.916,00:07:32.000,I'm painting Lulu now!
00:07:46.041,00:07:48.416,"You're right, something is missing."
00:07:48.500,00:07:50.833,"It's okay, Franny."
00:07:51.250,00:07:53.458,"No, no. I want you to be happy."
00:07:53.958,00:07:55.250,I will fix it.
00:07:55.916,00:07:57.708,But what's missing?
00:08:01.375,00:08:02.583,Ěrduo!
00:08:02.666,00:08:03.666,Ěrduo!
00:08:05.166,00:08:06.916,I think Tilly knows.
00:08:07.625,00:08:10.250,But what does Ěrduo mean?
00:08:25.458,00:08:26.708,English and Mandarin.
00:08:26.791,00:08:31.208,I need your help so I can finish my picture of Lulu.
00:08:34.125,00:08:37.958,Oh! We used this to make silly noises. What's that word?
00:08:45.208,00:08:46.083,Zu.
00:08:51.250,00:08:55.291,I use these to see what I'm painting.
00:08:55.625,00:08:57.166,"What are they called, big kids?"
00:09:04.750,00:09:06.416,Ynjing.
00:09:10.416,00:09:14.875,"Oh, I use this to smell yummy food."
00:09:15.291,00:09:16.500,"What's that called, big kids?"
00:09:23.791,00:09:24.791,Bízi!
00:09:40.708,00:09:42.375,Ěrduo.
00:09:45.333,00:09:47.250,Tilly was right.
00:09:47.583,00:09:50.000,I'm a silly Franny.
00:09:50.083,00:09:52.583,I forgot to paint your ears.
00:09:53.875,00:09:55.166,Can you fix it?
00:09:55.250,00:09:57.208,I can fix it.
00:09:57.666,00:10:00.041,"But first, a..."
00:10:16.291,00:10:18.125,-Mouth! -Zu!
00:10:18.958,00:10:20.750,-Eyes! -Ynjing!
00:10:21.541,00:10:23.208,-Nose! -Bízi!
00:10:24.333,00:10:26.166,-Ears! -Ěrduo!
00:10:39.000,00:10:40.916,Yippee-i-o-ki-ay!
00:10:47.208,00:10:49.166,"And, finished."
00:10:49.250,00:10:52.250,"With pretty, purple panda ears."
00:10:54.291,00:10:55.916,"Thanks, Franny."
00:10:56.291,00:10:58.625,"Now, that's a great picture of Lulu."
00:11:03.500,00:11:06.041,Because Lulu is the best.
00:11:07.250,00:11:09.833,-She's also the best at xylophone. -Yeah.
00:11:09.916,00:11:12.166,"Hey, Lulu, do you want to rock out with us?"
00:11:13.166,00:11:15.666,"Yes, yes, yes! Ha-ha!"
00:11:16.541,00:11:18.666,Let's rock!
00:11:23.333,00:11:24.583,"Ready, Raffe?"
00:11:25.791,00:11:27.625,"You ready, big kids?"
00:11:28.166,00:11:32.250,"One, two, three, four..."
00:11:32.583,00:11:34.166,Hit it!
00:11:42.958,00:11:44.416,Whoo!
00:11:44.916,00:11:46.666,"Good xylophone, Lulu!"
00:11:46.750,00:11:48.416,"Oh! Thanks, Bailey!"
