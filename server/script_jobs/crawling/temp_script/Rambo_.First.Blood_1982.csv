00:02:40.833,00:02:45.000,"Excuse me. Can you tell me, is this where Delmare Berry lives?"
00:02:45.833,00:02:46.958,He ain't here.
00:02:48.500,00:02:49.833,"Go on inside, baby."
00:02:55.958,00:03:00.916,"Well, he's a friend of mine… As a matter of fact, he wrote this address down."
00:03:01.916,00:03:02.458,&lrm;Right here.
00:03:03.958,00:03:04.708,Here.
00:03:05.250,00:03:07.333,You can see that's Delmare's writing.
00:03:07.916,00:03:10.000,I sure had a hard time finding this place!
00:03:10.416,00:03:13.625,"-That's his writin'. -Well, like I said, he's a friend."
00:03:14.208,00:03:18.041,My name is John Rambo. We served on the same team together in Nam.
00:03:18.583,00:03:25.708,I don't know if he ever talked about me… I've got a picture of us together.
00:03:26.916,00:03:33.458,Somewhere… Here… here it is.
00:03:34.000,00:03:40.791,"That's me, that's Danforth, Westmore, Bronson, Ortega, and there's Delmare, right in the back."
00:03:40.875,00:03:45.250,"We had to put him in the back because he's so big, if we didn't, he'd take up the whole picture! Look how big he is."
00:03:45.666,00:03:46.750,Delmare's gone.
00:03:47.166,00:03:48.000,&lrm;Oh.
00:03:48.541,00:03:51.458,-When wil-- What time will he be back? -He died.
00:03:52.250,00:03:53.000,What?
00:03:54.416,00:03:55.583,Died last summer.
00:03:57.750,00:03:58.458,Died how?
00:03:59.791,00:04:00.458,Cancer.
00:04:01.916,00:04:03.291,&lrm;Brought it back from Nam.
00:04:04.458,00:04:06.583,All that orange stuff they spreaded around.
00:04:08.208,00:04:09.791,Cut him down to nothing.
00:04:10.958,00:04:12.375,&lrm;I could lift him off the sheet.
00:04:22.500,00:04:23.625,I'm very sorry.
00:05:19.958,00:05:21.750,"Morning, Amy! How are you doing, girls?"
00:05:21.833,00:05:23.833,"-Great, thanks. -Alright this morning?"
00:05:27.208,00:05:28.875,"-Andy! -Howdy, Will!"
00:05:41.583,00:05:42.458,"Morning, Dave!"
00:05:42.958,00:05:43.958,"&lrm;Hi, Sheriff!"
00:05:44.375,00:05:45.791,Gonna take a bath this week?
00:05:54.125,00:05:54.666,Morning!
00:05:59.708,00:06:02.875,You… you visiting somebody around here?
00:06:04.541,00:06:05.583,No.
00:06:07.708,00:06:14.625,"You know, wearing that flag on that jacket, looking the way you do… you're askin' for trouble around here, friend!"
00:06:16.333,00:06:17.791,Headed North or South?
00:06:18.500,00:06:19.083,&lrm;North.
00:06:21.000,00:06:24.708,"Jump in, &lrm;I'll make sure &lrm;you head in the right direction, huh!"
00:06:37.125,00:06:38.041,Where are you headed?
00:06:38.791,00:06:39.666,&lrm;Portland.
00:06:39.750,00:06:41.958,"Portland is South, you said you were headed North."
00:06:42.333,00:06:43.166,&lrm;No.
00:06:44.041,00:06:45.666,You got some place I can eat around here?
00:06:48.208,00:06:50.416,There's a diner about 30 miles up the highway.
00:06:53.416,00:06:55.625,Is there any law against me getting something here?
00:06:55.708,00:06:57.125,"Yeah, me."
00:06:59.541,00:07:00.791,Why are you pushin' me?
00:07:02.791,00:07:03.750,What did you say?
00:07:05.708,00:07:07.666,"I said why are you pushing me, I haven't done anything to you."
00:07:07.750,00:07:10.833,"First of all, you don't ask the questions around here, I do. Understand?"
00:07:10.916,00:07:16.375,Secondly… &lrm;we don't want &lrm;guys like you in this town.
00:07:18.625,00:07:19.291,Drifters.
00:07:19.958,00:07:23.916,First thing you know we got a whole bunch of guys like you in this town. That's why!
00:07:26.083,00:07:31.291,"Besides, you wouldn't like it here. This is… It's a quiet little town."
00:07:33.000,00:07:34.541,"In fact, you might say it's boring!"
00:07:35.958,00:07:37.166,But that's the way we like it.
00:07:38.916,00:07:40.875,And I get paid to keep it that way.
00:07:42.583,00:08:01.458,"Boring… Portland, straight ahead!"
00:08:03.958,00:08:08.250,If you want some friendly advice… Get your hair cut and take a bath.
00:08:08.958,00:08:10.291,&lrm;You wouldn't get hassled so much!
00:08:11.083,00:08:12.291,Hope this ride helped you out!
00:08:19.416,00:08:20.625,"Have a nice day, huh!"
00:09:03.125,00:09:04.500,"Hey, I'm talkin' to you, goddammit!"
00:09:10.333,00:09:11.166,Let me see some I.D.!
00:09:12.833,00:09:14.000,"All right, you're under arrest!"
00:09:15.208,00:09:16.625,You hear me? Now put your hands on the car.
00:09:17.166,00:09:19.416,"Now you put your hands on the car, and you spread 'em."
00:09:22.500,00:09:23.916,Now you're gonna put your hands on that car.
00:09:24.916,00:09:26.791,"How you do it, you decide, right now!"
00:09:40.750,00:09:41.750,Put your legs back.
00:09:43.333,00:09:44.208,Back!
00:09:47.375,00:09:48.958,You try to be nice to some people!
00:09:53.916,00:09:55.708,"Well, what do we have here, huh?"
00:09:59.916,00:10:01.666,Why would you be carrying a knife like this?
00:10:02.666,00:10:03.458,Hunting.
00:10:04.708,00:10:05.750,Don't be a wise guy!
00:10:06.958,00:10:08.333,&lrm;What do you hunt with a knife?
00:10:09.500,00:10:10.333,Name it.
00:10:20.458,00:10:22.708,"Hey, talk about your sorry-looking humanity!"
00:10:28.666,00:10:32.375,"-Good morning, Arthur. -Morning, Will. What do you got?"
00:10:32.916,00:10:38.250,"I want you to book this gentleman for vagrancy, resisting arrest, &lrm;carrying a concealed weapon."
00:10:39.375,00:10:40.666,He says he uses it for hunting.
00:10:41.875,00:10:44.166,"Huntin'? What do you hunt, elephants?"
00:10:44.583,00:10:47.916,See if you can clean him up a little bit. He smells like an animal!
00:11:02.916,00:11:03.958,Right here.
00:11:04.500,00:11:05.333,That's it.
00:11:27.250,00:11:28.083,&lrm;Hmm?
00:11:28.458,00:11:30.625,"Would you take this for me, please? Thank you."
00:11:39.041,00:11:39.750,Name?
00:11:45.291,00:11:46.083,Your name?
00:11:48.083,00:11:49.166,Your name!
00:11:59.083,00:12:01.291,Hey… you're lookin' for trouble?
00:12:02.208,00:12:03.875,"You came at the right place, buddy!"
00:12:04.541,00:12:05.916,"Oh, wait a second."
00:12:07.500,00:12:09.625,You got three seconds before I break your face in!
00:12:11.041,00:12:12.000,He means it.
00:12:12.333,00:12:13.708,"Yeah, I do."
00:12:32.916,00:12:34.125,What do you know about that?
00:12:34.833,00:12:36.250,&lrm;Old Harry here is a soldier!
00:12:37.791,00:12:41.250,Rambo… John J.?
00:12:44.333,00:12:45.583,You're gonna talk to me.
00:12:47.250,00:12:49.208,"I promise you're gonna talk to me, soldier."
00:12:51.750,00:12:53.541,I'm starting to dislike you.
00:12:56.250,00:12:57.250,A lot.
00:12:58.666,00:13:00.208,I'm gonna run a make on him.
00:13:02.833,00:13:04.333,Put his name in the Teletype.
00:13:07.958,00:13:10.000,Roll it across!
00:13:10.666,00:13:11.875,"&lrm;Oh, man."
00:13:13.041,00:13:15.916,"It won't work that way, it'll only smear. Now, roll it across!"
00:13:17.125,00:13:20.875,"Look, you son of a bitch, &lrm;if you don't put your goddamned hand &lrm;down there, I'm gonna break it off!"
00:13:20.958,00:13:21.625,&lrm;Move it.
00:13:21.708,00:13:25.500,"-Put it down, goddammit! -Art, what the hell's going on down here?"
00:13:25.875,00:13:27.416,"Oh, nothing I can't handle."
00:13:29.250,00:13:30.583,He won't let us print him well.
00:13:31.708,00:13:33.333,Leave the ink on the hand!
00:13:35.375,00:13:36.875,"Just what is your problem, huh?"
00:13:38.250,00:13:43.000,"Listen, hardass! As things stand right now, you're facing the ass end of a 90-day incarceration!"
00:13:43.083,00:13:46.916,"Plus a 250 dollars fine, which you don't look to me like you can pay!"
00:13:48.291,00:13:50.416,"At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, you're going up in front of that judge."
00:13:51.041,00:13:52.291,And you think we're tough!
00:13:53.833,00:13:56.875,"Now, we're gonna make you a little bit more presentable for your courtroom appearance."
00:13:58.041,00:14:02.750,"Between now and then, you can just impress the hell outta me by doing exactly as you're told."
00:14:08.916,00:14:09.791,"Now, clean him up."
00:14:13.083,00:14:16.083,"&lrm;I want you to go over there &lrm;and get that hose ready, alright?"
00:14:19.583,00:14:21.166,"Holy shit, look at this!"
00:14:22.208,00:14:23.583,&lrm;What the hell's he been into?
00:14:23.666,00:14:24.833,Who gives a shit?
00:14:26.083,00:14:28.458,"All right, put your hands on top of your head and turn around."
00:14:32.958,00:14:33.916,"Oh, Christ!"
00:14:34.708,00:14:36.916,"&lrm;We should report this to Teasle, Gault! &lrm;Look at that!"
00:14:37.708,00:14:39.333,You just do what I tell you.
00:14:44.000,00:14:45.916,"Gault, what the fuck was that?"
00:14:47.083,00:14:48.625,"Well, the Man said clean him up."
00:14:52.541,00:14:53.541,Clean him up!
00:15:02.916,00:15:08.041,"Hey, Preston, &lrm;don't forget &lrm;to get him behind the ears!"
00:15:14.041,00:15:15.291,"How'd you like that, huh?"
00:15:16.291,00:15:17.375,"What's the matter, Mitch?"
00:15:17.958,00:15:19.208,&lrm;Don't you like water sports?
00:15:31.041,00:15:33.083,"&lrm;-Alright, sit down! &lrm;-Easy. Sit down."
00:15:33.583,00:15:34.375,Sit down!
00:15:42.125,00:15:43.125,&lrm;Damn it.
00:15:43.208,00:15:44.833,"Damn it, that boy's hard to get a hold of!"
00:15:47.208,00:15:49.708,"That's okay, Ward, don't worry about the soap, he's tough."
00:15:49.791,00:15:51.500,Just shave him. Dry!
00:15:51.583,00:15:57.041,All right… How blind are you? Can't you see this guy's crazy?
00:15:57.125,00:15:58.958,Can't you see I don't give a shit?
00:15:59.833,00:16:02.000,"-Yeah, I can see that. -Yeah, that's better."
00:16:02.666,00:16:36.625,"See there, I knew that you-- You son of a bitch! Come on!"
00:16:44.291,00:16:47.125,&lrm;Get him off of me. Get him off of me.
00:16:55.083,00:17:00.625,What the hell is… Art!
00:17:01.875,00:17:02.833,&lrm;Art!
00:17:24.250,00:17:25.583,"&lrm;Hey! Hey, wait!"
00:17:48.375,00:17:50.750,"-I'm gonna kill this son of a bitch! -No, Art, don't shoot!"
00:17:50.833,00:17:53.791,"Art, goddamnit! Don't shoot, there's people down there!"
00:17:53.875,00:17:55.291,"All right, get help! I'll go after him!"
00:17:59.041,00:18:00.833,"Get outta the way! Yeah, get out!"
00:19:40.500,00:19:41.750,Son of a bitch!
00:19:50.791,00:19:52.875,"Lester, this is Will. I'm right on his tail."
00:19:52.958,00:19:55.333,"He's just east of Smith's farm, headed towards Chapman Creek."
00:21:15.083,00:21:16.500,I know you can hear me!
00:21:18.833,00:21:20.083,You're finished!
00:21:21.875,00:21:23.708,You've gone as far as you're gonna go!
00:21:26.958,00:21:28.333,D'you hear me?
00:22:35.583,00:22:36.333,Lester!
00:22:38.333,00:22:40.083,He's up there behind the draw.
00:22:41.375,00:22:42.875,"Mitch, get Orval on the radio."
00:22:43.791,00:22:46.041,Tell him to get out here with his damned dogs right away.
00:22:46.916,00:22:48.541,And tell him to bring the Dobermanns!
00:22:48.625,00:22:50.375,"It's gonna rain, we'll need dogs that can hunt on sight."
00:22:51.708,00:22:55.208,"Lester, tell Paul to get out to the lumber camp to get the helicopter up here."
00:22:55.291,00:22:56.000,&lrm;All right.
00:22:56.083,00:22:59.458,"If they give him any shit, &lrm;tell him to site him &lrm;for obstruction right on the spot."
00:23:02.708,00:23:03.458,We'll get him!
00:23:05.000,00:23:05.875,No problem.
00:23:42.500,00:23:44.750,"Come on, sweethearts! That's it, babies!"
00:23:45.041,00:23:46.416,"Let's go get him, babies!"
00:23:47.166,00:23:48.458,"&lrm;Yeah, we'll be done in a couple of hours."
00:23:48.541,00:23:51.208,"Won't be long before he's stuffed and mounted, huh Will?"
00:23:51.791,00:23:53.416,Make him into a bear rug!
00:23:53.500,00:23:54.833,Didn't we go hunting here up last year?
00:23:54.916,00:23:56.583,"Yeah, I got a couple of bucks last year!"
00:23:56.666,00:23:57.958,&lrm;I'll shoot anything.
00:23:58.041,00:23:59.708,"Hey Mitch, up the hill!"
00:24:20.625,00:24:23.333,"Keep those dogs away from me, Orval! I don't trust those bastards!"
00:24:23.416,00:24:26.708,"Keep moving, my dogs can eat and run at the same time!"
00:24:27.625,00:24:28.791,He's going straight to the top.
00:24:30.833,00:24:32.166,Isn't that supposed to be dangerous?
00:24:32.250,00:24:33.416,He's just dumb!
00:24:47.791,00:24:48.416,&lrm;Come on.
00:24:49.083,00:24:49.833,"&lrm;Oh, oh!"
00:24:49.916,00:24:53.875,"Hey, you're spoiling the scent. Let my babies do their job! Go ahead."
00:24:54.875,00:24:56.125,I'm trailing you here.
00:24:57.458,00:24:59.250,-This is no good. -Why?
00:25:00.250,00:25:02.458,There were three of us on him in the cell block.
00:25:02.541,00:25:04.208,He went through us like we weren't even there.
00:25:06.125,00:25:07.000,"Ah, come on."
00:26:22.166,00:26:24.500,"Art, this is Teasle. He's headed for Chapman Gorge."
00:26:42.833,00:26:43.833,God!
00:27:21.250,00:27:22.333,Son of a bitch!
00:27:30.833,00:27:32.083,What the hell is going on?
00:27:32.166,00:27:34.958,What are you doing? We're just supposed to spot him.
00:27:39.000,00:27:42.416,"Galt, he's stuck there. He can't go anyplace."
00:27:43.250,00:27:48.416,"If you don't fly this thing right, I swear to God, I'm gonna kill you."
00:27:57.625,00:27:59.375,"Hold it steady, you son of a bitch!"
00:27:59.458,00:28:01.166,"Galt, come in, goddamn it!"
00:28:10.875,00:28:12.708,I got him. Easy.
00:28:39.750,00:28:40.458,Ow!
00:28:42.625,00:28:43.416,&lrm;Jesus!
00:28:59.125,00:29:00.333,There he is!
00:29:35.833,00:29:38.791,"I don't want him dead, Galt! I want him alive. You hear me?"
00:29:38.958,00:29:39.958,"Art, come in!"
00:30:38.166,00:30:42.208,"Art Galt, come in. Helicopter, come in, goddamn it!"
00:30:42.291,00:30:43.833,Jesus Christ! Look!
00:30:47.625,00:30:50.500,"Jesus Christ. Give me the binoculars, hurry."
00:30:51.791,00:30:54.416,"Oh, no, no, no. Shit!"
00:31:00.375,00:31:01.916,Jesus Christ.
00:31:40.625,00:31:41.708,I can't figure it.
00:31:42.791,00:31:43.625,How'd he fall out?
00:31:45.000,00:31:45.666,&lrm;Does it matter?
00:31:45.750,00:31:48.416,Let's nail this sucker's ass. He can't be far.
00:31:49.166,00:31:49.791,Will!
00:31:59.583,00:32:01.208,It's not my fault!
00:32:02.000,00:32:03.458,&lrm;I don't want any more hurt!
00:32:05.583,00:32:07.916,Stand right where you are! Give yourself up!
00:32:08.250,00:32:09.916,But I didn't do anything!
00:32:10.000,00:32:13.000,"I'm warning you boy, don't make a move! I'll blow your head off!"
00:32:13.083,00:32:15.041,I didn't do anything!
00:32:17.666,00:32:18.291,Ow!
00:32:23.625,00:32:25.708,"Ward, goddamn it, cease fire!"
00:32:27.500,00:32:28.208,I think we hit him.
00:32:28.791,00:32:30.250,Let's get down there. Move!
00:32:39.000,00:32:41.750,"-Go ahead, Will. -Lester, we're down in the gorge."
00:32:43.250,00:32:45.916,Galt's dead all right. Where the hell is that goddamn chopper?
00:32:46.375,00:32:49.416,"He won't come, Will. Says there's a storm headed your way."
00:32:49.500,00:32:53.416,I don't give a goddamn what's on its way! I want that chopper back here right now!
00:32:54.166,00:32:55.916,I don't want Galt's body out here all night.
00:32:56.000,00:32:59.375,"I'll do what I can. Listen, Will, &lrm;you sure picked one hell &lrm;of a guy to mess around with."
00:33:00.041,00:33:03.541,"This came over the teletype a few minutes ago, John Rambo is a Vietnam vet."
00:33:04.125,00:33:07.833,He's a Green Beret. Congressional Medal of Honor. Guy's a war hero.
00:33:09.875,00:33:12.041,I knew there was something about that guy.
00:33:13.125,00:33:14.375,"I double-checked it, Will."
00:33:14.458,00:33:15.625,What do you want me to do?
00:33:21.250,00:33:23.083,"I want you to do what I told you to do, goddamn it!"
00:33:23.166,00:33:25.000,Get that chopper back here now! Out!
00:33:29.500,00:33:30.333,Green Beret.
00:33:31.375,00:33:32.500,&lrm;War hero.
00:33:33.666,00:33:36.625,-That's great. That's just great. -Why don't you shut your mouth?
00:33:37.750,00:33:40.958,"Now, what the hell's the matter with you guys? He's one man. He's wounded."
00:33:42.416,00:33:45.375,"Those Green Berets, they're real bad asses."
00:33:46.041,00:33:47.500,Why don't you let the state police handle this?
00:33:52.916,00:33:55.250,"Come here, boy. Come here, goddamn it!"
00:33:56.416,00:33:59.875,"Look, look at him, look at him! It's Art Galt, boy."
00:34:00.625,00:34:03.666,He and I were friends when your mama was still wiping your nose!
00:34:04.750,00:34:05.666,Now he's dead.
00:34:06.541,00:34:08.166,&lrm;He's dead because &lrm;of that psycho out there!
00:34:08.250,00:34:09.833,"Now you listen, boy, you listen to me good."
00:34:09.916,00:34:11.416,&lrm;I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.
00:34:12.041,00:34:15.125,And I'm gonna pin that Congressional Medal of Honor to his liver.
00:34:16.208,00:34:20.208,And I'm gonna do it with you or without you.
00:34:48.666,00:34:49.791,&lrm;That's all we need now.
00:34:50.375,00:34:53.083,"Will, come on, let's get out of here before it gets too dark."
00:34:55.250,00:34:56.416,You goddamn pansy.
00:34:57.166,00:34:59.541,"Ward, put your gun down. I'll show you who the pansy is."
00:34:59.625,00:35:00.708,"Okay, come on down!"
00:35:03.166,00:35:06.291,"Ward, move on! The fight is out there!"
00:35:06.375,00:35:07.958,He's out there waiting for you!
00:35:08.041,00:35:10.583,"Mitch, get on your feet. Get on your feet and move!"
00:35:11.291,00:35:12.666,"Let's go find this guy, for Christ's sake!"
00:35:15.875,00:35:16.958,"I'll see you later, Ward!"
00:35:17.666,00:35:18.583,"Shut up, Mitch!"
00:35:23.958,00:35:25.041,"Let's go, girl. Come on."
00:35:27.500,00:35:28.583,&lrm;There he is!
00:35:45.791,00:35:46.583,Cease fire!
00:35:50.291,00:35:52.333,"I'm hit! Goddamn it, I'm hit!"
00:35:54.750,00:35:55.375,Jesus.
00:35:57.375,00:35:58.375,&lrm;He's got a gun.
00:35:59.125,00:35:59.875,Shit.
00:36:06.666,00:36:09.375,It's not him! It's a goddamn scarecrow!
00:36:10.041,00:36:11.666,It was no scarecrow that shot Orval!
00:36:14.125,00:36:15.958,Kill him! Kill him!
00:36:16.500,00:36:17.750,&lrm;Go get him!
00:36:18.166,00:36:19.416,"Go get him, Maggie!"
00:36:29.750,00:36:30.500,Mitch!
00:36:32.041,00:36:33.333,"Mitch, Ward, come here."
00:36:34.583,00:36:36.250,"Shingleton, you cover us."
00:36:36.333,00:36:37.333,&lrm;Look at his leg.
00:36:38.125,00:36:40.541,"Mitch, get your belt. Get a tourniquet around that."
00:36:40.625,00:36:42.125,We gotta get this guy to a doctor!
00:36:42.208,00:36:43.833,&lrm;Goddamn it! Get your belt on there fast!
00:36:43.916,00:36:46.166,-Where's the first aid kit? -I left it in the car.
00:36:46.250,00:36:47.083,Shit!
00:36:47.166,00:36:48.375,&lrm;Where'd he get the gun?
00:36:48.458,00:36:49.750,It's got to be Art Galt's gun.
00:36:50.375,00:36:52.041,-He's out of ammo. -How do you know that?
00:36:52.541,00:36:55.333,Because whatever killed that last dog was no bullet! That's how.
00:36:55.416,00:36:56.000,&lrm;Hurry up!
00:36:56.666,00:36:57.875,"Orval, listen to me. Now listen."
00:36:58.375,00:36:59.333,"&lrm;You got to stay awake, all right?"
00:37:00.083,00:37:01.833,You got to release that tourniquet every 15 minutes.
00:37:01.916,00:37:03.333,We'll be right back!
00:37:03.416,00:37:06.083,We got to get him now. He's out of ammo. Hurry up! Move!
00:37:06.166,00:37:07.666,&lrm;He had no right to shoot my babies.
00:37:08.208,00:37:10.875,-Get the son of a bitch! Go get him! -Come on! Let's go!
00:37:12.291,00:37:14.541,"All right. All right. Now, listen up."
00:37:15.791,00:37:18.916,We're right on top of him. We're gonna form a skirmish line 50 feet apart.
00:37:19.000,00:37:21.583,And keep moving. There's no way out of here except through us.
00:37:25.000,00:37:27.208,Okay. Let's do some hunting.
00:37:29.041,00:37:31.250,We ain't hunting him. He's hunting us.
00:38:08.791,00:38:09.500,Ow!
00:38:10.291,00:38:11.041,&lrm;Damn!
00:38:11.916,00:38:12.541,&lrm;Ow!
00:38:13.875,00:38:15.083,"God, I hate this!"
00:39:25.750,00:39:26.500,Huh?
00:39:26.583,00:39:27.833,&lrm;Ow! God!
00:39:29.250,00:39:30.333,"Will, it's Mitch!"
00:39:32.708,00:39:35.041,"Oh, God!"
00:39:35.125,00:39:36.208,Will!
00:40:08.416,00:40:09.750,-What the hell's going on? -Shut up!
00:40:13.791,00:40:14.625,He's got Ward.
00:40:15.208,00:40:16.583,"All right, spread out. I'll go this way."
00:40:17.583,00:40:18.833,Will!
00:40:18.916,00:40:20.041,Will!
00:40:20.125,00:40:22.291,&lrm;Oh! Oh!
00:40:26.416,00:40:27.458,Over here!
00:40:27.541,00:40:29.083,Will! He's over here!
00:40:32.125,00:40:32.833,Who fired?
00:40:34.458,00:40:35.625,Who the hell is firing?
00:40:35.708,00:40:37.625,&lrm;I got him! I got him!
00:40:37.708,00:40:39.166,"Shingleton, follow me!"
00:40:41.250,00:40:42.041,I got him!
00:40:44.416,00:40:46.166,Somebody help me!
00:40:47.000,00:40:48.416,"&lrm;Help me, Will!"
00:40:49.625,00:40:50.750,Will!
00:40:50.833,00:40:51.666,&lrm;Balford?
00:40:53.416,00:40:56.041,"-Balford, where the hell are ya? -Will!"
00:40:57.666,00:40:58.875,Help!
00:41:01.333,00:41:02.125,&lrm;Help me!
00:41:02.208,00:41:03.291,Balford?
00:41:08.750,00:41:09.958,"Shingleton, over here!"
00:41:11.375,00:41:12.000,God.
00:41:13.625,00:41:14.625,&lrm;Jesus.
00:41:14.708,00:41:16.291,-Easy. Easy. -Get me out of here.
00:41:17.375,00:41:17.916,All right. Hold it.
00:41:23.750,00:41:24.708,&lrm;Jesus Christ!
00:41:26.541,00:41:28.416,"Shingleton, where the hell are ya?"
00:41:36.166,00:41:36.958,Shingleton?
00:41:39.208,00:41:40.083,Will!
00:41:42.291,00:41:43.125,Will!
00:41:45.166,00:41:46.416,Jesus Christ!
00:41:47.250,00:41:53.500,Jesus… I could've killed them all.
00:41:54.208,00:41:55.541,I could have killed you.
00:41:56.583,00:41:59.291,"In town, you're the law. Out here, it's me."
00:42:00.166,00:42:01.166,Don't push it!
00:42:02.291,00:42:04.666,"Don't push it, or I'll give you a war you won't believe."
00:42:08.250,00:42:09.416,Let it go!
00:42:11.041,00:42:12.541,Let it go!
00:43:00.583,00:43:02.500,Come on. Get back.
00:43:02.583,00:43:04.333,"&lrm;Move back, you guys. Move back."
00:43:04.416,00:43:05.833,&lrm;He's gonna be alright.
00:43:07.875,00:43:08.875,&lrm;All right.
00:43:14.333,00:43:16.750,"Captain, can we have a comment on what's happening?"
00:43:16.833,00:43:23.000,"How bad is the situation? Captain, we need some… Only good thing to come out of this mess is the business we're doing in town."
00:43:23.791,00:43:25.416,Reporters are drinking the place dry.
00:43:28.958,00:43:30.875,"You look like you're ready to keel over, Will."
00:43:31.750,00:43:34.166,Why don't you go home? It's my problem now.
00:43:34.250,00:43:39.458,"Your problem? Listen, Dave, don't give me any of your horseshit about jurisdiction on this one, you understand?"
00:43:40.083,00:43:42.708,-Would you like me to step outside? -Just finish up what you're doing.
00:43:46.166,00:43:51.541,"possibly above the snow line, shrouded in mist, the fugitive John Rambo is hiding."
00:43:52.416,00:43:56.875,"Units of the state police, along with local members of the National Guard… are now being mobilized."
00:43:57.791,00:44:09.125,What still remains unexplained by local authorities… is just how and where the former Green Beret… came into possession of the weapons with which he allegedly killed one deputy sheriff… and tried to kill six others.
00:44:09.208,00:44:13.083,Only their skilled training in police enforcement techniques saved their lives.
00:44:13.166,00:44:16.916,And word now is that the fugitive will be in custody in a matter of hours.
00:44:19.000,00:44:19.583,"Here's the maps, Will."
00:44:21.333,00:44:23.291,"Will, there's something I think you ought to know."
00:44:25.458,00:44:25.958,Talk to you later. Okay?
00:44:26.750,00:44:29.333,"What is it, Lester? What is it? For chrissake's! Spit it out!"
00:44:31.791,00:44:39.958,"Well, I was, I was just talking to Mitch, and he was saying that Galt and a couple deputies were, uh, &lrm;a little hard on the guy."
00:44:40.041,00:44:41.208,Assholes!
00:44:42.250,00:44:45.666,"Doesn't make one goddamn bit of difference, Dave, and you know it!"
00:44:46.916,00:44:53.000,"Look, if one of my deputies… gets out of line with a prisoner, then the prisoner comes to me with it!"
00:44:53.083,00:44:56.000,"If I find out it's like he says, I kick the deputy's ass!"
00:44:56.083,00:44:58.583,Me! The law! That's the way it's got to be!
00:45:00.333,00:45:03.416,People start fuckin' around with the law and all hell breaks loose!
00:45:12.500,00:45:13.375,I made him.
00:45:13.958,00:45:14.916,&lrm;Who the hell are you?
00:45:15.666,00:45:19.208,Sam Trautman. Colonel Samuel Trautman.
00:45:19.291,00:45:21.708,"We're a little busy this morning, Colonel. What can I do for you?"
00:45:21.791,00:45:23.916,-I've come to get my boy. -Your boy?
00:45:24.625,00:45:26.500,I recruited him. I trained him.
00:45:26.583,00:45:28.666,I commanded him in Vietnam for three years.
00:45:29.708,00:45:31.000,I'd say that makes him mine.
00:45:31.083,00:45:36.333,I wonder why the Pentagon would &lrm;send a full-bird colonel &lrm;down here to handle this.
00:45:36.958,00:45:39.208,The Army thought I might be able to help.
00:45:39.291,00:45:42.666,I don't know in what way. Rambo's a civilian now. He's my problem.
00:45:44.291,00:45:45.666,I don't think you understand.
00:45:46.333,00:45:48.375,I didn't come here to rescue Rambo from you.
00:45:49.208,00:45:50.833,I came here to rescue you from him.
00:45:52.541,00:45:54.791,"&lrm;Well, we all appreciate &lrm;your concern, Colonel."
00:45:55.541,00:45:56.875,I will try to be extra careful.
00:45:58.041,00:46:00.583,I'm just amazed that he allowed any of your posse to live.
00:46:01.250,00:46:01.958,Is that right?
00:46:02.791,00:46:05.833,"Strictly speaking, he slipped up. You're lucky to be breathing."
00:46:06.583,00:46:07.750,That's just great!
00:46:09.083,00:46:12.208,"Colonel, you came out here to find out why one of your machines blew a gasket."
00:46:13.166,00:46:17.291,You don't seem to want to accept the fact that you're dealing with an expert in guerrilla warfare.
00:46:18.250,00:46:22.583,"With a man who's the best… with guns, with knives, with his bare hands."
00:46:23.375,00:46:31.916,"A man who's been trained to ignore pain, ignore weather, to live off the land, to eat things that would make a billy goat puke."
00:46:32.916,00:46:35.583,"In Vietnam, his job was to dispose of enemy personnel."
00:46:35.666,00:46:37.833,To kill. Period.
00:46:38.833,00:46:39.916,Win by attrition.
00:46:41.041,00:46:42.541,"Well, Rambo was the best."
00:47:38.625,00:47:41.125,"Okay, Colonel, now you got us all scared to death."
00:47:41.208,00:47:46.083,What do you and the Special Forces think I ought to do about your psycho out there?
00:47:47.333,00:47:48.041,&lrm;Let him go.
00:47:48.666,00:47:50.166,-Do what? -For now.
00:47:51.500,00:47:53.583,Diffuse the whole situation. Diffuse him.
00:47:54.500,00:47:57.083,Provide a little gap and let him slip through it.
00:47:57.166,00:47:58.833,Then put out a nationwide A.P.B.
00:47:59.666,00:48:02.375,"In a couple of weeks, you'll pick him up in Seattle or someplace, &lrm;working in a car wash."
00:48:02.458,00:48:04.250,There'll be no fight. Nobody else will get hurt.
00:48:04.333,00:48:05.875,I do my own work.
00:48:05.958,00:48:09.583,I don't figure the best way to do that is to close my eyes &lrm;and then hope he gets &lrm;picked up in Seattle.
00:48:10.333,00:48:12.083,"If you send your people in there after him, they'll get killed."
00:48:12.625,00:48:19.416,"You know, we're just a small, hick town sheriff's department, Colonel, but we're expected to do our duty… just like our heroes in the Special Forces."
00:48:19.500,00:48:22.666,"In Special Forces, we teach our people to stay alive in the line of duty."
00:48:22.750,00:48:24.583,No shit! I never thought of that.
00:48:24.666,00:48:25.791,&lrm;You want a war you can't win?
00:48:25.875,00:48:30.125,Are you telling me that 200 men against your boy is a no-win situation for us?
00:48:30.791,00:48:32.125,"You send that many, don't forget one thing."
00:48:32.208,00:48:32.833,What?
00:48:33.416,00:48:35.333,&lrm;A good supply of body bags.
00:48:38.833,00:48:39.875,Trautman!
00:48:42.708,00:48:44.583,"I don't know which side you're on, Trautman."
00:48:45.333,00:48:47.416,I still think you came out here just to cover your ass.
00:48:48.416,00:48:51.666,"But if you're serious about taking Rambo out clean, follow me."
00:49:23.041,00:49:26.583,"State Police calling John Rambo. Come in, please."
00:49:26.666,00:49:27.583,&lrm;Acknowledge.
00:49:30.000,00:49:32.041,"If you're listening, Rambo, here is your situation."
00:49:32.583,00:49:33.708,You are surrounded.
00:49:34.208,00:49:36.416,Every possible exit has been blocked.
00:49:36.500,00:49:39.291,"Every highway, every road, every firebreak."
00:49:39.875,00:49:44.791,"You have our word that your services to your country will be taken into consideration, and you will receive fair treatment."
00:49:45.416,00:49:48.083,Just respond. We can work everything out. Over.
00:49:50.750,00:49:52.208,He took a radio off of one of my deputies.
00:49:52.750,00:49:53.791,Then he has to be listening.
00:49:54.458,00:49:57.083,"If I was in his position, I'd try to pick up information."
00:49:57.166,00:49:59.666,-Maybe catch some cross talk. -Of course he's listening.
00:49:59.750,00:50:01.541,But he's not gonna break radio silence.
00:50:01.625,00:50:03.041,&lrm;No. Not for us.
00:50:03.125,00:50:04.625,"But he might do it for you, Colonel."
00:50:05.541,00:50:06.666,"He's your boy, isn't he?"
00:50:09.541,00:50:13.250,Maybe you can talk him into sparing all our lives by giving himself up.
00:50:14.541,00:50:15.458,I can try.
00:50:16.125,00:50:19.750,"At least, we'll get a radio fix on his position, if you don't mind setting him up for us."
00:50:19.833,00:50:20.833,Setting him up for you?
00:50:21.791,00:50:23.583,&lrm;That's like bringing the pigeons &lrm;to the cat.
00:50:29.083,00:50:31.000,"Hey, Don, thanks for bringing your people out."
00:50:31.083,00:50:31.791,"Any time, Will."
00:50:32.416,00:50:34.750,"Come on, Bobby, put the magazine away, will ya? Pay attention."
00:50:35.458,00:50:36.625,We may only get one crack at this.
00:50:48.083,00:50:49.458,Covey Leader calling Raven.
00:50:54.208,00:50:55.375,Covey Leader to Raven.
00:50:55.458,00:50:56.916,"&lrm;Talk to me, Johnny."
00:50:59.458,00:51:01.250,Covey Leader to identify Baker Team.
00:51:02.250,00:51:11.916,"Rambo, &lrm;Messner, Ortega, &lrm;Coletta, Jorgensen, &lrm;Danforth, Berry, &lrm;Krackauer."
00:51:12.708,00:51:13.541,&lrm;Confirm.
00:51:14.291,00:51:15.625,This is Col. Trautman.
00:51:18.208,00:51:19.208,"Talk to me, Johnny."
00:51:35.250,00:51:36.916,It's him. It's him. Get on it.
00:51:38.125,00:51:39.916,"Rambo, are you all right? Over."
00:51:40.000,00:51:41.833,"Baker Team, they're all dead, sir."
00:51:43.250,00:51:45.208,Not Delmare Berry. He made it.
00:51:46.666,00:51:47.916,"Berry's gone too, sir."
00:51:49.583,00:51:50.250,How?
00:51:51.375,00:51:53.958,Got himself killed in 'Nam. Didn't even know it.
00:51:54.625,00:51:55.875,Cancer ate him down to the bone.
00:51:58.000,00:51:59.333,I'm sorry. I didn't know.
00:52:00.875,00:52:02.250,"I'm the last one, sir."
00:52:03.208,00:52:06.375,"It's good to hear your voice, Johnny. It's been a long time."
00:52:08.583,00:52:11.666,"Look, John, you've done some damage here, but they don't want any more trouble."
00:52:13.666,00:52:15.000,That's why I've come.
00:52:16.666,00:52:18.000,I'm gonna come in there and fly you the hell out.
00:52:18.083,00:52:20.708,Just you and me. We'll work this thing out together.
00:52:21.208,00:52:22.000,Is that fair enough?
00:52:23.458,00:52:24.750,"Where'd you come from, sir?"
00:52:25.250,00:52:25.916,Bragg.
00:52:27.833,00:52:30.750,"I tried to get in touch with you, &lrm;but the guys &lrm;at Bragg never knew where to find you."
00:52:30.833,00:52:33.333,I haven't been spending much time there lately.
00:52:33.416,00:52:36.250,They've got me down in D.C. I'm shining a seat with my ass.
00:52:37.375,00:52:39.125,I wish I was back at Bragg now.
00:52:42.208,00:52:43.583,We'll talk about that when you come in.
00:52:44.333,00:52:45.458,"I can't do that, sir."
00:52:48.875,00:52:52.166,"Well, look, John, we can't have you runnin' around out there… wastin' friendly civilians."
00:52:52.875,00:52:54.291,&lrm;There are no friendly civilians.
00:52:54.958,00:52:56.000,"I'm your friend, Johnny."
00:52:57.208,00:52:59.541,I was there with you knee-deep in all that blood and guts.
00:53:00.458,00:53:02.083,I covered your ass more than once.
00:53:05.333,00:53:08.291,Seems like bailin' you out of trouble is gettin' to be a lifetime job for me.
00:53:08.875,00:53:11.041,There wouldn't be no trouble except for that king-shit cop.
00:53:12.166,00:53:16.750,"All I wanted was something to eat, but the man kept pushing, sir."
00:53:17.875,00:53:19.416,"You did some pushing of your own, John."
00:53:20.791,00:53:22.291,"They drew first blood, not me."
00:53:22.875,00:53:25.916,"Look, Johnny, &lrm;let me come in &lrm;and get you the hell out of there."
00:53:28.250,00:53:29.458,They drew first blood.
00:53:38.625,00:53:40.958,"Rambo, are you still reading me?"
00:53:46.125,00:53:47.500,Covey Leader to Raven.
00:53:49.166,00:53:50.333,"Rambo, acknowledge."
00:53:51.958,00:53:53.000,"He's all finished, Colonel."
00:53:54.541,00:53:56.000,"We've got a real good fix on him, though."
00:53:56.708,00:53:58.916,"Come first light, I'm gonna put every man I got up on that ridge."
00:54:00.458,00:54:01.291,Then we'll get him my way.
00:54:07.541,00:54:08.708,&lrm;Goddamn it.
00:54:11.000,00:54:11.750,Goddamn it.
00:54:16.666,00:54:18.166,Come on. Let's go. Over here.
00:54:22.083,00:54:23.500,Come on! Move it!
00:54:26.291,00:54:27.166,Let's go.
00:54:28.666,00:54:29.916,"Hey, this guy got a gun?"
00:54:30.000,00:54:31.541,Watch it. It's slippery.
00:54:31.625,00:54:32.833,Come on.
00:54:34.333,00:54:35.333,Watch your step.
00:54:36.625,00:54:37.666,What was that?
00:54:42.166,00:54:44.041,To the left or the right?
00:54:44.125,00:54:45.166,&lrm;Which way did he go?
00:54:45.250,00:54:46.583,Toss it across. Toss it.
00:54:47.250,00:54:48.041,Which way?
00:55:37.416,00:55:38.125,Pa!
00:55:38.666,00:55:40.833,&lrm;Pa! Pa!
00:56:19.666,00:56:23.625,"Yes. Yes, I know exactly where it is. Listen to me very carefully."
00:56:23.708,00:56:26.416,"Surround the area with every man you've got, but don't move in."
00:56:26.500,00:56:29.333,"I repeat, don't move in. In fact, don't do anything 'til I get there."
00:56:29.833,00:56:32.625,And no shooting. I don't want him dead. I want him alive.
00:56:38.583,00:56:40.041,Get down!
00:56:54.625,00:56:55.916,"Come on, guys. Shoot!"
00:56:57.791,00:56:58.500,Come on!
00:57:01.125,00:57:02.208,"Oh, you guys are great."
00:57:03.208,00:57:04.958,"-All right, Steve? -Yo?"
00:57:05.041,00:57:08.000,"I want you and Bruce, head around these trees, go to the front of that mine."
00:57:08.083,00:57:09.916,"Screw that, Clinton. I ain't goin' up there."
00:57:10.000,00:57:10.791,No way.
00:57:15.625,00:57:16.666,-Raymond? -What?
00:57:17.708,00:57:20.125,"-I want you to go into that mine. -Oh, not me."
00:57:20.791,00:57:21.916,"What do you mean, not me?"
00:57:22.000,00:57:24.583,"Look, I do this part-time. I didn't come here to get killed."
00:57:24.666,00:57:26.791,&lrm;He's probably in there &lrm;just waitin' for us.
00:57:26.875,00:57:28.333,"What's wrong with you, Clinton?"
00:57:32.833,00:57:33.625,"All right, Rambo?"
00:57:34.958,00:57:39.041,"&lrm;This is Lieutenant Clinton Morgen, National Guard Leader."
00:57:41.041,00:57:45.375,"Now, I'm giving you just three-zero seconds to come on out!"
00:57:47.500,00:57:48.916,Who's got the rocket launcher?
00:57:58.208,00:57:59.041,Maybe we should wait.
00:58:00.791,00:58:02.458,"Earl, this creep is a killer."
00:58:02.958,00:58:05.375,"Besides, I'm in charge, and I say we blow it up."
00:58:06.125,00:58:07.291,Now fire that thing.
00:58:07.916,00:58:09.416,Just let me get out of the way first.
00:58:34.625,00:58:36.500,Give that man a cigar!
00:58:37.208,00:58:38.125,Bull's-eye!
00:59:18.250,00:59:20.875,-Where the hell are they? -Up the hill about 500 yards.
00:59:29.083,00:59:30.000,&lrm;I don't believe it.
00:59:32.541,00:59:34.833,"All right, Nick. One more for Soldier of Fortune."
00:59:34.916,00:59:36.041,Soldier of Fortune?
00:59:36.958,00:59:39.458,Damn it! What the hell do you think this is? Some kind of a circus?
00:59:40.000,00:59:41.250,Get the hell out of here!
00:59:42.958,00:59:48.625,"Clinton, Jesus… Didn't you get the word, Clinton? I told you people to wait until I got up here!"
00:59:48.708,00:59:52.041,"He was shootin' at us, Will. Come on, I wasn't takin' any chances."
00:59:54.125,00:59:55.458,"Christ, what a mess."
00:59:58.041,00:59:59.875,We're gonna have to dig his body out of there right away.
01:00:02.291,01:00:03.458,You can't get a dozer up here.
01:00:03.541,01:00:05.333,You're going to have to find somebody to dig him out.
01:00:05.416,01:00:07.125,"It's your mess, Clinton. You clean it up."
01:00:07.833,01:00:10.291,"&lrm;Will, come on! I gotta be back &lrm;at the drugstore tomorrow."
01:00:10.375,01:00:12.541,"Then you better get started right away, Clinton!"
01:00:16.541,01:00:17.541,Shit!
01:01:01.666,01:01:04.458,Buried in a hole by a bunch of goddamn weekend warriors.
01:01:05.916,01:01:07.291,I thought you said he was the best you ever trained.
01:01:08.375,01:01:11.333,"However he may have ended up, there was a time when he was very special."
01:01:12.083,01:01:15.333,"Special, my ass. He's just another drifter that broke the law."
01:01:15.416,01:01:16.500,"Vagrancy, wasn't it?"
01:01:17.375,01:01:19.791,That's gonna look real good on his gravestone at Arlington.
01:01:20.708,01:01:31.291,"Here lies John Rambo, winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor, survivor of countless incursions behind enemy lines, killed for vagrancy in Jerkwater, U.S.A."
01:01:31.375,01:01:33.916,"Now don't give me any of that crap, Trautman."
01:01:35.083,01:01:38.375,You think Rambo was the only guy who had a tough time in Vietnam?
01:01:38.458,01:01:40.791,"He killed a police officer, for Christ sake!"
01:01:40.875,01:01:42.666,You're goddamn lucky he didn't kill all of ya.
01:02:04.666,01:02:08.875,And wished we'd let the goddamn maniac go loose so we can save our own asses!
01:02:08.958,01:02:12.333,"Well, we saved our asses, Colonel, and we didn't let him go loose!"
01:02:12.416,01:02:13.750,The best man lost!
01:02:15.000,01:02:16.083,And he doesn't like it!
01:02:42.541,01:02:45.250,Why did we follow him up here? This is so damn stupid.
01:02:46.416,01:02:47.208,I wanna get outta here.
01:03:49.875,01:03:52.000,"-How ya doin', Will? -Hold my calls."
01:06:13.208,01:06:13.791,Colonel?
01:06:18.916,01:06:19.791,Have a seat.
01:06:25.875,01:06:29.125,"Oh, miss, would you do this again, please?"
01:06:29.208,01:06:30.458,"-Hi, Sheriff. -And for my friend."
01:06:31.375,01:06:32.833,Give me a shooter. Wild Turkey.
01:06:35.625,01:06:40.333,"Look, if I was out of line before, I… &lrm;I just want to apologize."
01:06:42.583,01:06:44.750,"None of that makes much difference now, does it?"
01:06:47.166,01:06:48.041,"Nah, I guess not."
01:06:50.291,01:07:00.375,I suppose… I don't know. I just feel… Like you were cheated out of your chance.
01:07:01.666,01:07:03.083,I wanted to kill that kid.
01:07:04.875,01:07:06.875,I wanted to kill him so bad I could taste it.
01:07:09.333,01:07:10.875,"Doesn't sit well with that badge, hmm?"
01:07:12.541,01:07:14.541,It can get confusing sometimes.
01:07:16.916,01:07:19.958,"In Vietnam, you can bet that Rambo and I got pretty confused."
01:07:20.708,01:07:22.375,But we had orders.
01:07:23.958,01:07:26.083,"When in doubt, &lrm;kill."
01:07:30.666,01:07:31.875,"What the hell, you're a civilian."
01:07:31.958,01:07:36.458,You can go home to your… &lrm;wife and your house &lrm;and your little flower garden.
01:07:37.000,01:07:38.625,You're under no pressure to figure all this out.
01:07:38.708,01:07:41.541,"What about you, Colonel? What did you figure out from all of this, huh?"
01:07:42.500,01:07:43.791,What would you have done with him if he came in?
01:07:44.625,01:07:47.250,"Would you wrap your arms around him, give him a big, sloppy kiss?"
01:07:47.333,01:07:49.250,Or would you have blown his brains out?
01:07:58.291,01:08:01.000,I couldn't answer that until I met him face-to-face.
01:08:03.166,01:08:04.041,Yeah.
01:08:04.958,01:08:06.041,"&lrm;Well, there it is."
01:08:08.291,01:08:10.375,It's just as well we never got a chance to find out.
01:08:11.333,01:08:12.166,Hmm.
01:10:02.833,01:10:03.666,Drive.
01:10:06.750,01:10:08.083,"Don't look at me, look at the road."
01:10:08.750,01:10:10.083,That's how accidents happen.
01:10:11.666,01:10:12.791,What's your name?
01:10:12.875,01:10:14.666,"&lrm;Ca… Cathcart, Robert A."
01:10:15.333,01:10:16.916,"All right, what do ya got in the back, Robert A.?"
01:10:17.541,01:10:18.125,M60.
01:10:22.500,01:10:24.250,"-Okay, Robert A., get outta the truck. -Oh, please!"
01:10:24.333,01:10:26.125,I got no beef with you. No!
01:10:26.208,01:10:27.791,&lrm;Go on! Move! Go on!
01:10:45.500,01:10:46.291,&lrm;Whoa!
01:10:52.250,01:10:53.333,Want to turn that up?
01:11:05.708,01:11:07.041,&lrm;is on the loose again.
01:11:07.125,01:11:07.708,Shit.
01:11:07.791,01:11:09.458,"&lrm;Roger, Steamboat. This is Trapper."
01:11:09.541,01:11:11.500,We're setting up roadblocks on Highway 26.
01:11:11.583,01:11:13.250,"Hey, Will, it's Rambo."
01:11:13.333,01:11:14.291,&lrm;He's still around.
01:13:30.666,01:13:31.541,Heads up!
01:13:32.625,01:13:33.541,&lrm;Get out of the way!
01:14:55.416,01:14:56.833,Holy fuck!
01:14:56.916,01:14:58.958,"All right, get out there right away. Move!"
01:15:24.750,01:15:26.666,What the hell is goin' on?
01:15:29.750,01:15:31.916,-Watch yourself! -They're all gonna blow!
01:15:42.708,01:15:44.083,"Attention, all civilians."
01:15:45.833,01:15:49.500,"For your own safety, please evacuate the streets immediately."
01:15:51.041,01:15:53.916,Remain indoors until you receive further instructions.
01:15:54.000,01:15:59.416,"I repeat, this is a police emergency. Please evacuate the streets immediately."
01:16:18.500,01:16:19.541,We found Rambo's body.
01:16:20.666,01:16:25.083,"As a matter of fact, &lrm;it stole an army truck, blew up a gas station on the other side of town."
01:16:27.375,01:16:28.125,The kid is resilient.
01:16:30.083,01:16:31.791,Why don't forget what you're thinkin' and clear out while you can?
01:16:32.375,01:16:35.000,"Get the fuck outta here, Trautman, and you take your advice with you."
01:16:36.708,01:16:39.541,"When I talked to you earlier this afternoon, you knew he was still alive, didn't you?"
01:16:42.208,01:16:44.500,"&lrm;-I suspected. &lrm;-Yeah, sure."
01:16:45.125,01:16:46.333,Sure. That's why you stuck around.
01:16:47.375,01:16:48.291,&lrm;You trained him.
01:16:48.875,01:16:51.125,You taught him how to get out of places like that cave.
01:16:52.375,01:16:54.083,But he's not gonna get out of this place.
01:16:54.958,01:16:57.458,"Teasle, you and all your men couldn't handle him before."
01:16:57.541,01:16:59.291,What makes you think you can handle him now?
01:17:00.333,01:17:02.375,Because God knows what damage he's prepared to do.
01:17:14.041,01:17:15.416,"You're gonna die, Teasle."
01:17:16.708,01:17:17.916,&lrm;Everybody dies.
01:17:19.291,01:17:21.583,There's only one man in this room that's got half a chance.
01:17:22.083,01:17:23.291,That's not because I'm better than he is.
01:17:24.083,01:17:25.458,It's because he trusts me.
01:17:26.166,01:17:28.250,"See, I'm the closest thing to family he has left."
01:17:28.333,01:17:30.208,And that may be all the edge I need.
01:17:30.833,01:17:32.708,"Jesus Christ, where do you people come from?"
01:17:38.333,01:17:40.791,"Now, this is my job, Trautman. This is my town."
01:17:41.666,01:17:44.875,And I'm not giving it up to you or to Rambo or to anybody else.
01:17:45.625,01:17:47.416,"Now, you just stay the hell out of my way."
01:17:58.208,01:17:59.458,Get a little closer!
01:17:59.541,01:18:01.375,&lrm;I can't! It's too goddamn hot!
01:18:03.750,01:18:05.541,"Will, this is Lester. Do you copy? Over."
01:18:07.708,01:18:08.958,"&lrm;Come on, let's go!"
01:18:09.041,01:18:10.708,"Will, this is Lester. Do you copy? Over."
01:18:11.916,01:18:14.958,"Listen, Will, we got some serious problems."
01:18:15.041,01:18:16.375,The highway's been cut off.
01:18:16.458,01:18:19.375,"&lrm;The truck's out here, &lrm;but we couldn't find the body."
01:18:19.458,01:18:22.708,"I repeat, &lrm;no body. It's totally burned out."
01:18:22.791,01:18:24.125,"Preston, get those people outta here!"
01:18:25.625,01:18:26.875,&lrm;Move 'em back to the south side.
01:18:28.916,01:18:39.833,&lrm;we don't know how many gasoline reservoirs &lrm;there are under those gas pumps… -Do you copy? Over. -We got a reporter here.
01:18:39.916,01:18:43.208,"Preston, push them back! I don't care who he is!"
01:18:51.583,01:18:53.208,"Will, do you copy? Over."
01:21:45.083,01:21:46.000,Goddamn it!
01:21:47.083,01:21:48.541,Goddamn it! Goddamn it!
01:24:25.458,01:24:26.250,Go ahead.
01:24:27.625,01:24:28.416,&lrm;Go ahead.
01:24:28.500,01:24:31.041,"Go ahead, you crazy son of a bitch! Finish me!"
01:24:33.000,01:24:34.208,"Rambo, don't do it!"
01:24:35.625,01:24:36.416,"Listen to me, Rambo."
01:24:37.125,01:24:38.375,&lrm;You have no chance.
01:24:42.625,01:24:44.958,I'm gonna order the chopper in to fly you back to Bragg.
01:24:48.000,01:24:48.750,&lrm;Hold your fire!
01:24:51.083,01:24:51.833,Kern!
01:24:52.458,01:24:53.041,&lrm;Yes?
01:24:53.625,01:24:54.291,&lrm;Hold your fire.
01:24:57.541,01:24:58.875,Think about what you're doing.
01:25:01.666,01:25:03.041,The building's perimeter is covered.
01:25:03.666,01:25:04.333,&lrm;No exits.
01:25:05.166,01:25:07.458,There are nearly 200 men out there and a lot of M16s.
01:25:08.750,01:25:10.583,You did everything to make this private war happen.
01:25:12.208,01:25:13.291,You've done enough damage!
01:25:14.416,01:25:16.041,"This mission is over, Rambo. Do you understand me?"
01:25:18.083,01:25:19.416,This mission is over!
01:25:22.833,01:25:23.833,Look at 'em out there.
01:25:27.500,01:25:28.041,Look at 'em!
01:25:31.750,01:25:33.375,"If you don't end this now, they're gonna kill you."
01:25:34.791,01:25:35.708,Is that what you want?
01:25:41.750,01:25:42.375,It's over!
01:25:42.458,01:25:43.916,&lrm;Nothing is over!
01:25:44.625,01:25:45.291,&lrm;Nothing!
01:25:46.041,01:25:47.375,You just don't turn it off!
01:25:48.333,01:25:49.333,It wasn't my war!
01:25:50.166,01:25:51.708,"You asked me, I didn't ask you!"
01:25:52.291,01:25:55.166,And I did what I had to do to win! But somebody wouldn't let us win!
01:25:56.041,01:26:02.000,"Then I come back to the world, &lrm;and I see all those maggots &lrm;at the airport… protestin' me, spittin'."
01:26:02.083,01:26:04.333,&lrm;Callin' me Baby Killer &lrm;and all kinds of vile crap!
01:26:05.625,01:26:07.500,"Who are they to protest me, huh?"
01:26:07.583,01:26:11.083,"Who are they, unless they've been me and been there and know what the hell they're yelling about!"
01:26:11.750,01:26:14.750,"It was a bad time for everyone, Rambo. It's all in the past now."
01:26:15.291,01:26:15.958,For you!
01:26:16.458,01:26:17.916,"&lrm;For me, civilian life is nothing!"
01:26:18.500,01:26:21.958,"In the field, we had a code of honor: You watch my back, I watch yours."
01:26:22.458,01:26:23.083,"Back here, there's nothing!"
01:26:23.666,01:26:25.250,&lrm;You're the last of an elite group.
01:26:26.458,01:26:27.291,Don't end it like this.
01:26:27.375,01:26:30.708,"Back there, I could fly a gunship, I could drive a tank."
01:26:30.791,01:26:32.500,I was in charge of million-dollar equipment!
01:26:32.583,01:26:35.333,"Back here, I can't even hold a job parking cars!"
01:26:41.958,01:26:43.875,"Geez. Oh, God."
01:26:45.625,01:26:46.958,Where is everybody?
01:26:48.541,01:26:49.458,"Oh, God."
01:26:52.916,01:26:55.541,"I had a friend, &lrm;it was Danforth."
01:26:57.291,01:26:58.625,"I had all these guys, man."
01:26:59.625,01:27:02.833,"Back there, I had all these fuckin' guys… who were my friends."
01:27:03.791,01:27:05.291,"'Cause back here, there's nothing."
01:27:05.958,01:27:07.125,Remember Danforth?
01:27:08.750,01:27:16.250,"He wore this black headband. I took one of his magic markers and it said, If found, mail us to Las Vegas &lrm;'cause we were always &lrm;talkin' about Vegas."
01:27:16.333,01:27:19.875,"And his fuckin' car, this red '58 Chevy convertible."
01:27:19.958,01:27:21.375,He was talkin' about this car.
01:27:21.458,01:27:23.458,He said we were gonna cruise 'til the tires fall off.
01:27:32.083,01:27:37.166,"We go in this bar in Saigon, and this kid comes up… this kid's carrying a shoeshine box."
01:27:37.250,01:27:38.916,"And he says, Shine, please."
01:27:39.000,01:27:39.833,&lrm;Shine.
01:27:40.333,01:27:43.166,"I said no. He kept askin', yeah, and Joey said yeah."
01:27:43.750,01:27:46.041,And I went to get a couple of beers.
01:27:46.583,01:27:49.500,And the box is wired. And he opened up the box.
01:27:50.000,01:27:52.166,Fuckin' blew his body all over the place.
01:27:53.000,01:27:54.625,And he's layin' there. He's fuckin' screamin'.
01:27:54.708,01:27:58.041,There's pieces of him all over me. Just… like this.
01:27:58.125,01:28:01.416,"And I'm tryin' to pull him off, you know? And this is my friend that's all over me!"
01:28:02.166,01:28:05.125,I've got blood and everything. I'm tryin' to hold him together.
01:28:05.208,01:28:07.791,I'm puttin' him together. His fuckin' insides keep comin' out!
01:28:08.541,01:28:10.208,And nobody would help!
01:28:10.875,01:28:13.916,"&lrm;Nobody would help! He's sayin', &lrm;I wanna go home, I wanna go home."
01:28:14.000,01:28:17.541,"He keeps callin' my name. I wanna go home, Johnny. I wanna drive my Chevy."
01:28:17.625,01:28:20.125,"I said, Why? I can't find your fuckin' legs."
01:28:21.333,01:28:22.750,I can't find your legs.
01:28:24.791,01:28:26.125,I can't get it out of my head.
01:28:27.208,01:28:28.750,Like it was seven years.
01:28:29.541,01:28:30.708,Every day I have this.
01:28:31.416,01:28:33.541,"Sometimes I wake up, I don't know where I am."
01:28:35.083,01:28:36.291,I don't talk to anybody.
01:28:38.166,01:28:43.000,Sometimes a day… sometimes a week.
01:28:45.000,01:28:46.458,I can't put it out of my mind.
01:28:53.000,01:28:53.791,Fuck it.
