00:02:02.705,00:02:04.249,"Why don’t we turn this off, huh?"
00:02:04.332,00:02:11.172,The way they shoved this country right down the fuckin’ stinker.
00:02:11.506,00:02:19.764,Keep your gigantic monkey dick out of my good pussy.
00:02:32.902,00:02:33.862,Did--?
00:02:34.404,00:02:36.364,Did she have any last words?
00:03:16.321,00:03:19.157,Are you reading the Elsewhere Saga?
00:03:20.867,00:03:22.035,Yeah.
00:03:22.744,00:03:24.495,"Yeah, I’m reading King of the Hidden Dark."
00:03:24.579,00:03:25.997,-Book two. Yeah. -Yeah.
00:03:26.080,00:03:27.624,I read those a while ago.
00:03:28.291,00:03:29.500,-My God. -Yeah.
00:03:29.584,00:03:35.173,"I’m... at the bit-- It’s like right before, um, the Battle of the-- The Tanhauser Gate."
00:03:35.256,00:03:36.549,"-Yeah, yeah, yeah. -I know. Yeah."
00:03:36.633,00:03:38.635,-It’s... really intense. -God.
00:03:38.718,00:03:40.303,I just-- Yeah.
00:03:40.386,00:03:44.849,"It’s so intense. I’m just, like, the whole time I feel like-- I know."
00:03:44.933,00:03:48.061,"“Archers, to me!” -Yeah. -Yes!"
00:03:48.728,00:03:50.939,-It’s so good. -It’s so fucking good.
00:03:51.856,00:03:52.982,Yeah.
00:03:56.736,00:03:59.489,You know her real father is actually the war mage.
00:04:02.200,00:04:03.785,Yeah.
00:04:05.411,00:04:07.664,Ca--? Captain Borgo?
00:04:07.747,00:04:10.041,"He’s Lady Kieran’s real father, yeah."
00:04:10.875,00:04:15.880,"-Fuck. -When I read that, I was like, “What the fuck?” -Yeah. -It’s coming up. You’ll see."
00:04:15.964,00:04:17.006,Thank you.
00:04:19.050,00:04:24.222,"Clues were all there, if you think about it, but-- Have a good night."
00:04:37.402,00:04:39.779,Un-fucking-believable.
00:05:34.625,00:05:36.210,The fuck?
00:06:20.630,00:06:21.464,Fuck.
00:06:24.926,00:06:30.223,a laptop computer and then the silverware in here.
00:06:31.182,00:06:32.308,Anything else?
00:06:33.351,00:06:35.269,Not-Not that I can see.
00:06:35.728,00:06:36.854,"But, um..."
00:06:37.855,00:06:40.733,the silver was my grandma’s.
00:06:46.614,00:06:47.740,"Uh, the medications."
00:06:47.824,00:06:49.575,"Uh, no, it was, um..."
00:06:50.076,00:06:54.413,"clonazepam and, um, Lexapro."
00:06:54.497,00:06:56.499,"Uh, you try one of those, um..."
00:06:57.083,00:06:58.543,location apps?
00:06:59.001,00:07:01.546,"Yeah, I tried that, but the laptop’s turned off."
00:07:01.629,00:07:04.549,"Oh, well, they’ll probably wipe it anyway, unless they’re morons."
00:07:04.632,00:07:06.092,-Huh. -You have a hide-a-key?
00:07:06.175,00:07:07.969,One of those little fake rock thingies?
00:07:08.052,00:07:09.554,"I don’t, no."
00:07:11.264,00:07:15.268,"Uh, you leave that unlocked when you go out?"
00:07:15.351,00:07:18.229,"No, not usually. No."
00:07:19.230,00:07:20.565,But you did today.
00:07:23.943,00:07:25.695,I-- I don’t remember.
00:07:25.778,00:07:28.698,"I mean, I-- -I’m just saying that... -I think I locked it."
00:07:28.781,00:07:30.992,Wasn’t a forced entry though.
00:07:32.201,00:07:42.170,"So-- So, uh..."
00:07:42.920,00:07:44.505,what should I do now?
00:07:44.922,00:07:46.257,"Uh, about what?"
00:07:46.340,00:07:47.341,I mean...
00:07:47.884,00:07:49.635,do you call me or--?
00:07:49.719,00:07:51.179,Oh. Yeah.
00:07:51.262,00:07:54.223,"If anything is recovered, someone will be in contact."
00:07:54.307,00:07:57.351,"Your case number’s on that form, if you have renter’s insurance."
00:07:58.561,00:07:59.645,But...
00:08:00.980,00:08:02.315,"you’re gonna look, right?"
00:08:03.733,00:08:07.778,"Miss, uh, we will do everything we’re able to."
00:08:08.196,00:08:12.283,"In the meantime, I suggest you pay a little closer attention to your home security."
00:08:12.700,00:08:14.118,Don’t give ’em an opening.
00:08:14.994,00:08:15.953,Okay.
00:09:09.340,00:09:10.341,Hey.
00:09:11.175,00:09:13.427,"I’m not bothering you, am I?"
00:09:15.388,00:09:18.808,"It’s the... violation, man."
00:09:20.560,00:09:21.936,The stuff...
00:09:22.645,00:09:24.105,that’s replaceable.
00:09:24.188,00:09:34.740,"I-- Well, the silver’s not, but-- The thing that really hurts, you know, is the fucking violation."
00:09:36.033,00:09:37.868,"I mean, these people..."
00:09:39.078,00:09:42.164,were inside my house.
00:09:51.966,00:09:53.050,All right.
00:09:54.552,00:09:59.890,“Rays from some stars are thousands of years old before they reach your eyes.
00:10:01.475,00:10:06.105,Human bodies are made of dust and gases from inside of stars.
00:10:06.188,00:10:08.608,The universe is 14 billion years old.
00:10:08.691,00:10:10.735,No one knows what came before.
00:10:12.903,00:10:15.990,No one knows how big the universe actually is.
00:10:18.492,00:10:28.419,It-- It could be infinite.” -Jesus. -Mom!
00:10:28.502,00:10:30.880,-I’m sorry. -She’s fine. Don’t worry about it.
00:10:30.963,00:10:33.716,"She’s just, you know, five and not used to talking about death yet."
00:10:33.799,00:10:34.675,I’m so sorry.
00:10:35.092,00:10:37.928,A fucked-up thing happened to you. You’re allowed to be upset.
00:10:39.388,00:10:41.432,Patient died today.
00:10:42.558,00:10:43.934,I was in the room.
00:10:44.018,00:10:45.102,Oh.
00:10:45.519,00:10:47.063,"She was special, huh?"
00:10:54.195,00:10:55.321,No.
00:10:55.655,00:10:56.864,She sucked.
00:10:57.281,00:10:58.115,"-Huh. -Oh, yeah."
00:10:58.199,00:10:59.533,She was a real shithead.
00:11:05.081,00:11:06.832,But it doesn’t matter.
00:11:09.210,00:11:11.170,They’ll roll her out...
00:11:11.712,00:11:15.216,and she’ll become smoke.
00:11:16.467,00:11:17.551,Just...
00:11:18.886,00:11:20.012,carbon.
00:11:21.305,00:11:24.683,"My grandma Sally, that was her silver that they stole, you know?"
00:11:24.767,00:11:25.601,Yeah.
00:11:25.684,00:11:30.106,She literally breathed life into people who’d been exploded.
00:11:30.189,00:11:31.899,"-She was a war nurse. -Yeah, I remember."
00:11:31.982,00:11:36.946,Spent her retirement bringing dinner to folks with cancer.
00:11:37.029,00:11:39.907,And then she had a stroke...
00:11:40.783,00:11:43.494,and she was just-- just carbon too.
00:11:43.577,00:11:48.207,"And now I’m the only one who remembers any of that, and pretty soon..."
00:11:48.791,00:11:50.584,I’ll just be carbon.
00:11:50.668,00:11:52.336,So none of it matters.
00:11:52.420,00:12:02.263,"It does matter. She did happen, so-- The way people treat each other is just-- They’re disgusting. They’re disgusting."
00:12:02.346,00:12:04.056,The-The fucking...
00:12:04.765,00:12:05.933,taking.
00:12:07.101,00:12:09.687,"-Do you know what I mean? -Yeah, but, Ruthie, you gotta stop."
00:12:09.770,00:12:12.148,"-Fucking taking. Mine, mine. -Ruthie. Ruthie, Ruthie."
00:12:12.231,00:12:14.775,"-Fuck you. -Ruthie, stop, stop, stop. Stop."
00:12:16.652,00:12:18.404,You’re gonna make yourself sick.
00:12:23.868,00:12:26.662,"You’ve got it better than a lot of people. You know that, right?"
00:12:32.168,00:12:33.878,But everyone...
00:12:35.212,00:12:37.131,is an asshole.
00:12:37.214,00:12:38.424,"No, not everyone."
00:12:38.507,00:12:41.051,"-Yes, and dildos. Yes. -That’s not true."
00:12:41.135,00:12:42.928,-That is not true. -Fuck-faces.
00:12:43.012,00:12:44.305,Ruthie.
00:12:45.389,00:12:47.057,So what? So what?
00:12:47.141,00:12:49.935,"It’s just a sneeze. It’s just, uh..."
00:12:51.479,00:12:56.025,"chemistry and math and-- Uh, so what?"
00:12:56.901,00:12:58.736,"Sweetie, come on."
00:13:04.700,00:13:07.077,Sometimes I feel like I’m...
00:13:08.787,00:13:14.627,"like, underneath a whirlpool and-- Like I can’t even breathe."
00:13:22.593,00:13:23.552,Internet date?
00:13:24.887,00:13:26.764,"Uh, no, Ruthie’s house got robbed."
00:13:26.847,00:13:27.681,What?
00:13:28.057,00:13:29.600,That’s terrible.
00:13:39.318,00:13:40.945,Dan will make up the couch.
00:13:41.028,00:13:41.987,"Right, honey?"
00:13:57.795,00:13:59.004,Oh.
00:14:01.507,00:14:03.551,Aw. Is this me?
00:14:04.093,00:14:05.511,Mm-hmm.
00:14:07.429,00:14:08.764,Is it a dragon?
00:14:09.139,00:14:10.474,Stegosaurus.
00:14:14.562,00:14:16.063,I fuckin’ love it.
00:14:59.106,00:15:01.442,You’ve been shitting in my yard.
00:15:01.525,00:15:02.610,I have not.
00:15:02.693,00:15:03.903,Your dog.
00:15:04.320,00:15:05.821,Okay? I saw you.
00:15:06.196,00:15:12.620,"There is a sign there. It says “no shitting.” -It says that? -It’s a-- It’s a picture, okay?"
00:15:12.703,00:15:16.206,It’s like a little poop with a-- That’s what it means.
00:15:16.290,00:15:17.541,"Well, I didn’t see it."
00:15:17.625,00:15:19.960,You shouldn’t need a sign.
00:15:20.044,00:15:21.712,What is wrong with you?
00:15:23.672,00:15:24.590,Fine.
00:17:10.863,00:17:12.322,"-Yeah? -Hi, sir."
00:17:12.406,00:17:14.366,My house got robbed yesterday.
00:17:14.450,00:17:15.451,Suspicious?
00:17:15.534,00:17:16.994,Furtive?
00:17:17.077,00:17:19.580,Sneaky and-- I-I know what furtive is.
00:17:19.663,00:17:22.791,"Yeah, this Dominican fella came around here this morning with a push mower."
00:17:22.875,00:17:24.668,Son of bitches.
00:17:24.752,00:17:26.211,That’s-That’s what I thought.
00:17:26.295,00:17:28.505,Told him I could take care of my lawn. Good try.
00:17:28.589,00:17:30.591,I’ll tell you somethin’.
00:17:31.508,00:17:33.093,Why don’t you leave me your number?
00:17:33.969,00:17:35.512,"Um, if I think of somethin’..."
00:17:38.557,00:17:39.683,Mmm.
00:17:39.767,00:17:41.268,"Uh, what is it?"
00:17:41.351,00:17:45.397,"Oh, it’s just some regular yogurt you can sip on."
00:17:46.356,00:17:49.943,"I’m sorry that happened, but I don’t know anything to tell you."
00:17:50.778,00:17:52.071,"Yeah, okay."
00:18:46.667,00:18:48.335,E-Excuse me.
00:18:58.178,00:18:59.555,I said I was sorry.
00:19:00.055,00:19:04.768,"You said, uh, “fine.” The implication being that I meant-- Okay, never mind. Never mind."
00:19:05.102,00:19:06.353,-Don’t-- -Hey!
00:19:07.688,00:19:09.940,"Look, that’s not me."
00:19:10.315,00:19:13.443,Leaving a BM in your yard? That-That’s not who I am.
00:19:14.778,00:19:16.572,I-I was embarrassed.
00:19:16.655,00:19:19.741,"Sometimes I just get so deep in my thoughts, you know?"
00:19:19.825,00:19:23.078,"Like, deep, and I don’t even notice what Kevin’s doing."
00:19:27.541,00:19:28.750,"Oh, uh..."
00:19:29.585,00:19:30.544,forget it.
00:19:32.421,00:19:33.589,You can hit me.
00:19:35.340,00:19:36.508,-What? -One strike.
00:19:36.592,00:19:39.344,To balance the energy between us. I won’t defend myself.
00:19:40.387,00:19:41.263,Okay.
00:19:41.346,00:19:47.394,"I think, uh-- So, um, why are you here?"
00:19:53.108,00:19:54.693,My house got robbed.
00:19:54.776,00:19:55.736,When?
00:19:56.862,00:19:57.821,Yesterday.
00:19:57.905,00:19:59.907,-Did you call the authorities? -Yeah.
00:20:00.365,00:20:11.710,"I-- I don’t know. It seemed like they couldn’t really do anything, so-- I’m just asking around, you know, seeing if anyone saw anyone or-- What did they take?"
00:20:12.127,00:20:17.299,Uh-- They-- They took my computer.
00:20:18.300,00:20:27.935,"And they-- they took my grandma’s silver, which is really what-- Anjìng! Anjìng!"
00:20:29.061,00:20:29.895,That makes me...
00:20:30.437,00:20:32.105,so furious!
00:20:36.610,00:20:38.195,I’m-I’m sorry to have bothered you.
00:20:38.278,00:20:39.738,"No, you did not bother me."
00:20:39.821,00:20:41.406,This affects all of us.
00:20:41.490,00:20:42.324,"Kevin, stop it!"
00:20:42.407,00:20:46.286,"Okay. All right, so-- See ya. Bye, Kevin. Bye."
00:20:46.370,00:20:48.455,"Um, is there anything I can do?"
00:20:48.538,00:20:49.998,"Oh, I think I’m good."
00:20:50.082,00:20:51.833,I think I-I-- I got it.
00:20:51.917,00:20:52.751,Um...
00:20:53.252,00:20:55.254,thank you for everything.
00:22:19.129,00:22:20.464,Holy shit.
00:22:23.967,00:22:26.720,Fuck. Um-- Ah.
00:22:32.559,00:22:51.578,"You’ve reached Detective Bendix with, uh, Robbery-- Um-- Hi-- Hello. Um, yes. Okay."
00:22:51.661,00:22:57.834,"My laptop was stolen, and I can see it."
00:23:00.962,00:23:04.299,"N-N-No. No, it’s still-- it’s still stolen."
00:23:04.382,00:23:09.346,"Um, my phone-- You know, my phone is saying where it is."
00:23:09.429,00:23:11.098,I-I have the address.
00:23:11.181,00:23:18.313,"So, I need somebody to go there before they, like, turn it off or whatever."
00:23:20.065,00:23:24.694,"We can include that information in your report, but we cannot send units out at this time."
00:23:24.778,00:23:27.948,Would you like to include that information in the report?
00:23:28.865,00:23:30.575,What? What? Why?
00:23:30.659,00:23:33.620,They need a search warrant to dispatch units for this.
00:23:33.703,00:23:36.581,"No, because you-you don’t have to search."
00:23:36.665,00:23:39.167,We cannot send units out at this time.
00:23:39.251,00:23:42.963,"No, because I can-- -I know it’s right here, okay? -Ma’am."
00:23:43.046,00:23:45.590,-It’s on the fucking phone. -Ma’am.
00:23:45.674,00:23:47.259,-Ma’am. -I’m looking-- I’m looking at it.
00:23:47.342,00:23:49.553,I can give you the address. It’s on my fucking phone.
00:23:49.636,00:23:51.847,-It is on my fucking phone! -Ma’am.
00:23:53.682,00:24:36.975,"We can include that information in the report, but we cannot -send units out at this time. -Oh, you-- I got the fucking watermelon!"
00:24:57.829,00:25:00.081,"Hey. Uh, Angie’s closing tonight."
00:25:00.540,00:25:04.127,"Actually, I was kind of wondering, uh, what you were up to."
00:25:04.211,00:25:05.045,Me?
00:25:08.465,00:25:09.799,"Uh, what’s up?"
00:25:11.301,00:25:12.469,Oh.
00:25:12.802,00:25:15.847,You know what? It’s nothing. Don’t-- Never mind.
00:25:17.724,00:25:19.351,-I need backup. -Okay.
00:25:19.434,00:25:20.894,You got those ninja sticks?
00:25:20.977,00:25:23.521,"-Nunchaku is an Okinawan weapon-- -Fine, fine."
00:25:23.605,00:25:26.691,"-“Ninjas,” as you call them, are Japane-- -I just-- I’ve got a better idea."
00:25:26.775,00:25:30.278,-Are you familiar with the morning star? -No-- -Lights out. -Great.
00:25:30.362,00:25:32.405,-I just need you to ride with me. -Right on.
00:25:32.489,00:25:33.490,-I’m Ruth. -Tony.
00:25:33.907,00:25:34.866,-Nice to meet you. -Cool.
00:25:51.007,00:25:54.594,"Our Father, who art in heaven, grant me the strength..."
00:25:55.136,00:25:56.137,in the heat of battle...
00:25:57.055,00:25:58.306,and protect me...
00:26:04.104,00:26:05.313,Amen.
00:26:10.151,00:26:11.319,Were you praying?
00:26:11.403,00:26:13.571,"You asked for help, I asked for help."
00:26:13.655,00:26:15.031,That’s how things get done.
00:26:15.699,00:26:17.867,Don’t worry. I won’t let anything happen to you.
00:26:29.713,00:26:32.173,My computer is inside that house.
00:26:33.258,00:26:34.384,Say what?
00:26:50.233,00:26:52.193,I don’t know what the fuck that is.
00:26:53.945,00:26:54.779,Okay.
00:26:55.196,00:26:56.781,We don’t want any trouble.
00:26:57.115,00:27:01.578,"My computer was stolen, and this says that it’s in there."
00:27:02.162,00:27:04.956,I just want it back. There’s no questions...
00:27:06.041,00:27:08.043,"So, can you get it?"
00:27:11.254,00:27:13.089,I can get deez nuts.
00:27:15.592,00:27:18.094,You can get these nuts?
00:27:18.178,00:27:19.179,"All right, tough guy."
00:27:19.262,00:27:20.347,-You had your chance. -Oh.
00:27:21.097,00:27:22.098,Geez.
00:27:25.018,00:27:26.561,"-Oh, my God. -Oh, fuck. Oh!"
00:27:26.644,00:27:28.104,Are you okay?
00:27:28.396,00:27:33.943,"I’m really-- Dude, what’d you do to Keith?"
00:27:35.111,00:27:36.029,Dude!
00:27:37.489,00:27:38.448,The fuck you doing?

00:27:41.493,00:27:42.577,"Dude, stop!"
00:27:42.660,00:27:47.248,Both you motherfuckers better drag your-- Violence is not power! It’s like the absence of power!
00:27:47.332,00:27:50.710,"Get on outta here, ’fore I get my keys out and fuck you both the fuck up!"
00:27:50.794,00:27:52.045,Can’t believe you just walked...
00:27:52.128,00:27:53.838,"Super inappropriate, man."
00:27:55.256,00:27:56.341,Shit.
00:27:59.803,00:28:00.845,Thank you.
00:28:05.016,00:28:07.477,"Actually, I need the power cord."
00:28:14.359,00:28:15.485,Thank you.
00:28:20.740,00:28:22.659,It doesn’t feel very good...
00:28:23.159,00:28:28.665,"when people you don’t know come into your house and steal your shit, does it?"
00:28:30.166,00:28:31.835,Now where’s the silver...
00:28:32.919,00:28:34.170,and the medicine?
00:28:35.380,00:28:38.133,"Uh, I got some Theraflu..."
00:28:38.883,00:28:40.218,but no silver.
00:28:41.052,00:28:43.346,And I didn’t steal that. I paid good money for it.
00:28:46.641,00:28:48.768,-What are you talking about? -I bought it.
00:28:48.852,00:28:50.645,You bought it? From where?
00:28:50.729,00:28:52.230,Killer Sills’.
00:28:52.313,00:28:53.732,Ki-- What is that?
00:28:53.815,00:28:55.191,Consignment shop out the way.
00:28:55.275,00:28:57.110,Dracula-lookin’ motherfucker. He’ll sell you anything.
00:28:57.193,00:28:59.320,She got her first communion bracelet there.
00:28:59.654,00:29:00.905,It’s very pretty.
00:29:02.031,00:29:03.324,Does he have silverware?
00:29:05.410,00:29:06.411,Okay.
00:29:07.996,00:29:10.957,"-Write it down. -Uh, I can drop a pin for you."
00:29:11.040,00:29:12.584,"No, man, on paper."
00:29:33.313,00:29:34.272,Thank you.
00:29:50.580,00:29:52.332,That’s how hard I threw it.
00:30:58.439,00:30:59.899,"Oh, yeah."
00:31:54.829,00:31:57.624,"Um, the guest bathroom is downstairs."
00:31:57.707,00:31:59.792,It’s okay. It was an emergency.
00:32:35.495,00:32:37.789,"Hey there. You’re a guest of Miranda’s, right?"
00:32:37.872,00:32:39.207,Right. John.
00:32:39.290,00:32:40.708,You guys have a beautiful home.
00:32:40.792,00:32:42.877,"Remind me, how do you know Miranda again?"
00:32:44.212,00:32:47.090,"Uh, from work. She’s been a great mentor. I’m learning so much."
00:32:47.173,00:32:49.509,"-Stop. I’m gonna call the police. -Come on, man."
00:32:51.928,00:32:53.972,"Oh, there you are. Come on."
00:33:01.980,00:33:03.523,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
00:33:06.526,00:33:07.568,Get help.
00:33:23.835,00:33:24.836,Oh.
00:33:48.568,00:33:49.694,This way.
00:35:00.306,00:35:02.475,"Oh, yeah."
00:35:04.644,00:35:08.773,Now we’re cookin’ with gas.
00:35:18.116,00:35:21.619,"We’re almost there, my monkeys."
00:36:30.396,00:36:31.856,Maybe we should hold hands.
00:36:33.149,00:36:34.275,Like we’re engaged.
00:36:54.629,00:36:56.214,"What are you doing, little guy?"
00:37:02.428,00:37:05.973,"There you are, you son of a bitch. You’re on and stay on."
00:37:09.227,00:37:11.020,What the hell is this here?
00:37:14.273,00:37:15.608,Good afternoon.
00:37:18.444,00:37:19.528,Hi.
00:37:20.571,00:37:21.572,Yes. Hello.
00:37:21.656,00:37:22.657,Um...
00:37:23.741,00:37:31.290,"we were just wondering, um-- You like music?"
00:37:31.374,00:37:34.460,"-Yeah. -Yeah, I think everyone-- Five preset tones."
00:37:34.543,00:37:37.338,Three unique demo modes.
00:37:37.421,00:37:44.303,"-That’s so great. -We don’t really need-- -Really, thank you. -And-- And..."
00:37:45.846,00:37:46.681,Huh.
00:37:47.056,00:37:52.770,"Okay, we-- we’re really just looking for, um, some antique silver service."
00:37:57.233,00:38:04.240,If you don’t like music-- You can just say so.
00:38:07.952,00:38:09.036,Silver.
00:38:10.871,00:38:14.041,"Silver coins, silver polish..."
00:38:15.418,00:38:16.961,silver bullets.
00:38:17.670,00:38:20.589,Is your newer stuff in any particular place or--?
00:38:20.673,00:38:21.924,They’re antiques.
00:38:24.302,00:38:25.636,Got a customer.
00:39:27.073,00:39:28.282,This is it.
00:39:28.699,00:39:29.700,You sure?
00:39:29.784,00:39:30.826,Yeah.
00:39:31.160,00:39:33.913,“Sally Kimke.” Wow.

00:39:37.958,00:39:39.460,Go start the car.
00:39:42.171,00:39:43.172,"Okay, okay."
00:39:43.255,00:39:44.215,Go.
00:39:52.264,00:39:55.059,"-Final. -Well, uh, they were my mom’s."
00:40:12.284,00:40:13.452,"Okay, okay."
00:40:13.828,00:40:15.371,"Okay, okay."
00:40:33.639,00:40:36.016,Sure are unloading yourself these days.
00:40:37.059,00:40:43.566,"Well, we’re moving away, so-- -Yeah, we’re moving. -Everybody’s moving, kid."
00:40:44.400,00:40:45.609,Thanks a lot for your time.
00:40:49.697,00:40:51.323,"Yeah, we’re going to Las Vegas."
00:40:51.991,00:40:53.451,-Yeah? Yeah? -Yeah.
00:40:53.534,00:40:55.744,"Yeah, well, don’t lose it in Las Vegas."
00:40:59.290,00:41:00.332,Hey!
00:41:01.542,00:41:04.879,"Hey, lady, that-- Wait, that-- Come on back here!"
00:41:12.344,00:41:13.846,"Hey, come back here! Hey!"
00:41:13.929,00:41:16.056,"Hey, lady! You didn’t pay for that!"
00:41:16.140,00:41:17.558,This is stolen property.
00:41:17.641,00:41:18.601,"No, no, no, no."
00:41:18.684,00:41:20.519,"Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no."
00:41:20.603,00:41:21.562,It belongs to me.
00:41:21.645,00:41:23.272,"No, you come back here, lady."
00:41:27.318,00:41:28.736,"Oh, God. Oh, God, sir."
00:41:28.819,00:41:31.739,I-- I di-- Are you okay?
00:41:31.822,00:41:36.076,I di-- You-- You hit me.
00:41:36.160,00:41:37.453,I’m sorry.
00:41:51.967,00:41:53.177,"-Oh, my God. -Side kick."
00:41:55.971,00:41:57.139,That was a side kick.
00:42:07.233,00:42:08.067,Is he--?
00:42:10.778,00:42:11.987,"Nurse Wilson, T-2."
00:42:12.071,00:42:13.739,"Caught it in the mail slot, huh?"
00:42:17.660,00:42:19.161,Yes. Yep.
00:42:20.454,00:42:22.456,Must’ve really slammed it hard.
00:42:22.998,00:42:25.876,"Yeah, slammed the shit out of it."
00:42:28.087,00:42:29.255,Be careful with these.
00:42:29.338,00:42:30.965,"No alcohol, no driving."
00:42:33.175,00:42:37.012,You pivot on the ball of your foot and snap your hips out at the same time.
00:42:37.096,00:42:40.474,That transmits a huge amount of power outward through the leg.
00:42:41.225,00:42:44.228,It-It’s devastating when deployed correctly.
00:42:50.985,00:42:52.319,What are we doing?
00:42:53.028,00:42:54.113,Um...
00:42:54.822,00:42:55.823,whatever you want.
00:42:57.324,00:43:00.536,"What are we doing... here, the world?"
00:43:01.287,00:43:02.663,Trying to be good.
00:43:03.122,00:43:04.540,Or be better.
00:43:04.623,00:43:06.292,What about me? Am I good?
00:43:07.042,00:43:08.836,Yeah. Of course you are.
00:43:08.919,00:43:10.629,I clubbed an old man.
00:43:10.713,00:43:14.508,"Right, but in combat situation-- I’m so sorry."
00:43:15.593,00:43:16.635,Sorry?
00:43:17.386,00:43:19.096,I should be thanking you.
00:43:22.182,00:43:26.937,I-I-I don’t-- I don’t really have too many friends.
00:43:27.021,00:43:28.856,I’ve been told I’m obnoxious.
00:43:28.939,00:43:33.235,"But today, I felt-- I felt electric."
00:43:33.319,00:43:34.570,I don’t want to die.
00:43:35.613,00:43:36.947,You won’t.
00:43:38.532,00:43:40.784,Not right now?
00:43:42.953,00:43:45.706,It’s just gonna be black.
00:43:45.789,00:43:46.749,"No, it won’t."
00:43:46.832,00:43:48.208,"Yes, it will, Tony."
00:43:51.420,00:43:54.048,Like when you turn off a TV.
00:43:57.092,00:44:00.846,"Hey, uh, if you want, I was gonna catch an afternoon service."
00:44:00.929,00:44:02.222,I think you’d like it.
00:44:02.306,00:44:04.350,Minister’s so funny. Rev. Bill.
00:46:07.764,00:46:09.683,Y’all been sleeping in that van over there?
00:46:11.018,00:46:12.478,-No. -Really?
00:46:12.561,00:46:14.188,’Cause one of you three stinks.
00:46:16.273,00:46:19.777,It’s pork chops. We just dropped your mom off.
00:46:37.461,00:46:39.463,"Come on, you fuckin’ comedian."
00:46:59.274,00:47:00.817,Goddamn.
00:47:03.570,00:47:07.824,"Jesus, you get this one out of a fuckin’ shipwreck?"
00:47:10.369,00:47:13.330,"You get what you pay for, and you can barely pay for that."
00:47:21.004,00:48:08.260,I’m glad that we could finally-- Fuck.
00:48:22.774,00:48:24.151,How’s the finger?
00:48:27.738,00:48:29.448,Those fuckers got away.
00:48:30.324,00:48:32.200,What about the tag number?
00:48:32.909,00:48:37.080,"I didn’t get the tag number, so..."
00:48:37.539,00:48:39.458,Oh. I did.
00:48:41.501,00:48:42.753,Didn’t I say that?
00:48:43.879,00:48:45.088,No.
00:48:45.547,00:48:46.882,I did.
00:48:48.258,00:48:50.135,It’s all just ones and zeros.
00:48:50.218,00:48:53.221,"Binary data connected by threads, like a web."
00:48:53.889,00:48:57.392,"Yeah. I mean, it’s called the Web."
00:48:58.018,00:49:00.270,Just gotta know how to dodge the spiders.
00:49:05.317,00:49:07.861,Dude. I’m reading this one.
00:49:07.944,00:49:10.238,Don’t tell me what happens! I hate that.
00:49:11.406,00:49:13.825,"You’re so sly, but so am I."
00:49:18.121,00:49:20.540,That was a glitch. That needed a reboot anyway.
00:49:20.624,00:49:22.959,I... didn’t really see anything.
00:49:25.170,00:49:26.963,Open sesame.
00:49:32.552,00:49:34.262,"Oh. Uh, need a credit card."
00:49:51.947,00:49:53.573,Gotcha.
00:49:58.578,00:50:00.789,Christian Rumack.
00:50:22.144,00:50:23.353,Well...
00:50:23.937,00:50:25.272,that is...
00:50:26.356,00:50:27.858,That’s something.
00:50:28.734,00:50:33.363,"That’s something. What do you, uh-- Wh-What do you do, Miss Kimke?"
00:50:33.447,00:50:36.450,"Uh-- Well, I’m a nursing assistant."
00:50:38.243,00:50:45.292,"Now, suppose I came down to where you do that-- your hospital-- It’s a post-op facility."
00:50:45.917,00:50:47.294,Okay.
00:50:47.377,00:51:11.276,"Well, suppose I came down there and I said, “You know, maybe not that medication, Ruth, maybe this one instead, don’t ya think?” No, that’s what-- That’s not what I meant by-- You present a certainty that the owner of a vehicle you happened to see at a garage sale is the same individual who burglarized your home."
00:51:11.359,00:51:12.527,-And-- -His footprint.
00:51:12.611,00:51:19.159,"And that his foot, according to this, is made out of scrambled eggs."
00:51:19.659,00:51:21.953,"No. Uh, no, sir."
00:51:22.037,00:51:23.538,That is not-- Okay.
00:51:23.622,00:51:24.539,So...
00:51:29.085,00:51:33.089,Right. I-I understand the chain of events as you tell them.
00:51:33.173,00:51:34.007,Okay.
00:51:34.090,00:51:39.054,Did it not occur to you that the people who had your computer in the first place were the same ones that broke into your home?
00:51:39.137,00:51:42.015,-Yeah. But-- -Occam’s Razor and whatnot.
00:51:42.098,00:51:42.933,What?
00:51:43.016,00:51:50.482,Did it not occur to you that approaching a criminal suspect without official capacity is a good way to get your wig knocked off?
00:51:53.235,00:51:54.945,Let me see your hand.
00:51:56.738,00:51:58.782,-Can I see it? -It’s nothing.
00:51:58.865,00:52:00.492,Can I see it?
00:52:00.575,00:52:02.285,That’s what I thought. Yeah.
00:52:02.369,00:52:03.995,What happened to your finger?
00:52:06.081,00:52:07.582,"Ruth, look at me."
00:52:08.166,00:52:11.753,"-Were you engaged in a confrontation? -No, it was an accident."
00:52:13.922,00:52:17.384,Have you been able to replace your medications?
00:52:17.467,00:52:20.262,-I see. I see. -I’ll take that as a no.
00:52:20.345,00:52:21.847,Okay.
00:52:27.143,00:52:29.396,"I mean, why--?"
00:52:29.479,00:52:32.399,Why do you not want to help me?
00:52:32.482,00:52:34.901,-Help you? -Yeah. I just-- Why--?
00:52:35.485,00:52:37.863,-Isn’t it your job? -My job.
00:52:37.946,00:52:38.780,Yeah.
00:52:39.281,00:52:41.491,I am doing my job.
00:52:42.242,00:52:44.244,You’re asking me about my job right now.
00:52:44.327,00:52:46.413,"-Yeah, I’m coming in here-- -You come into my workplace..."
00:52:46.496,00:52:49.207,-I have things to help you-- -...and you ask me about my job.
00:52:49.291,00:52:56.423,"You think just because you left your door wide open for some punk to stroll right in, that the universe now somehow revolves around you?"
00:52:56.506,00:52:57.507,"Well, grow up."
00:52:57.591,00:53:00.260,We had a man beaten unconscious in his driveway.
00:53:00.343,00:53:02.470,"-That’s awful. -Yeah, it's awful."
00:53:02.554,00:53:07.183,"And now-- now, Ruth, he has skull fragments in his brain."
00:53:08.143,00:53:09.853,The world is bigger than your silverware.
00:53:09.936,00:53:12.564,People are experiencing bigger problems.
00:53:12.647,00:53:14.482,There are people out there...
00:53:22.449,00:53:29.039,"I’m, uh-- I’m being divorced."
00:53:30.123,00:53:31.958,First time I said it out loud.
00:53:34.044,00:53:38.715,"Sir, I’m very-- Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm. Move it. Move the hand."
00:53:40.842,00:53:42.052,"Go home, Ruth."
00:53:45.722,00:53:47.807,This is the guy.
00:53:47.891,00:53:50.435,"No, it is not."
00:53:51.603,00:53:59.402,"And if you engage in vigilante action or mess around with this again, I will be a bigger problem than your busted finger."
00:54:01.154,00:54:03.156,Do you follow me?
00:54:23.927,00:54:25.553,What now?
00:54:30.809,00:54:32.560,Pick your shit up.
00:54:37.732,00:54:39.234,Excuse me.
00:55:06.761,00:55:08.930,Must’ve robbed a ton of houses.
00:55:36.291,00:55:42.589,"Oh, excuse me. I just was-- -Good morning, ma’am. I-- -Police."
00:55:43.757,00:55:46.676,Okay. May we have a moment of your time?
00:55:48.386,00:55:50.305,"Well, I don’t see why not."
00:55:53.016,00:55:54.893,Come on in.
00:55:54.976,00:55:57.854,Welcome to my home. Make yourselves comfortable.
00:55:57.937,00:56:00.774,"Go on in the sittin’ room, sit on one of those couches."
00:56:01.149,00:56:02.776,They’re kinda new. They’re real comfortable.
00:56:02.859,00:56:04.944,-Can I get you a cup of coffee? -Not necessary.
00:56:05.028,00:56:06.821,"Um, no, thank you."
00:56:06.905,00:56:09.949,It’s no trouble. I just press a button on the machine-- boop!
00:56:10.033,00:56:13.870,"It’ll make a cappuccino too. It’s like AI, like a spaceship."
00:56:13.953,00:56:16.247,-Do you have cashew milk? -In that case...
00:56:16.331,00:56:18.333,I think I can find something.
00:56:24.547,00:56:26.257,I like nut milk.
00:56:26.341,00:56:34.516,"You know, my niece Cameron, she can’t have dairy, so I always have, like, hazelnut milk or-- You know, they do this Brazil nut thing now."
00:56:34.599,00:56:36.559,It’s actually pretty good.
00:56:36.976,00:56:39.729,I need to speak with Christian Rumack.
00:56:41.648,00:56:45.652,"Well, he is still out with his friends."
00:56:46.236,00:56:49.447,I expect him back God knows when. Talk about what?
00:56:51.908,00:56:53.451,Choices he made.
00:56:55.620,00:57:00.500,"Well, I ought to make sandwiches then because that could take all day."
00:57:01.251,00:57:02.877,Like sandwiches?
00:57:04.671,00:57:06.089,You hungry?
00:57:07.298,00:57:08.758,I’m never hungry.
00:57:10.176,00:57:14.222,"I used to get hungry a lot, but I don’t really get hungry anymore."
00:57:14.806,00:57:17.434,"Okay, here we go."
00:57:18.059,00:57:20.395,"Here you go, sweetie, with that nut milk."
00:57:21.521,00:57:22.939,Thank you.
00:57:23.022,00:57:24.941,-And here you go. -Thanks.
00:57:25.024,00:57:26.860,You’re welcome.
00:57:29.070,00:57:31.489,"-So, I was just wondering-- -A machine did this?"
00:57:31.573,00:57:33.950,Mm-hmm. Yup.
00:57:34.033,00:57:35.577,Huh.
00:57:35.660,00:57:37.662,I worked at Borders for a while.
00:57:39.038,00:57:41.332,"Oh, the bookstore?"
00:57:41.416,00:57:44.919,"Yeah, but they had a café too. I got pretty good with the steamer."
00:57:45.003,00:57:48.089,"-Mmm. -Could do smiley faces, winking faces."
00:57:48.173,00:57:53.678,"Certain kinds of centaurs, oak leaves, snowmen, diagram of an atom."
00:57:53.761,00:57:56.890,"-Wow. -Flaming swords, Kevin."
00:57:56.973,00:57:58.308,-Quite a skill. -Do you know...
00:57:58.391,00:58:02.061,-Hmm? -...Christian’s whereabouts the day before yesterday?
00:58:03.771,00:58:06.858,"Honey, I barely know his whereabouts any day."
00:58:06.941,00:58:10.111,But... he does have a job?
00:58:10.195,00:58:12.989,"Well, some would say that’s all he has."
00:58:14.491,00:58:17.118,-What’s he do? -Mmm.
00:58:17.619,00:58:19.287,Um...
00:58:19.829,00:58:22.248,"Lawyer, you know."
00:58:33.635,00:58:36.930,"Is he, uh-- Is he in his van now?"
00:58:37.013,00:58:39.891,"Oh. Oh, no, no, no, no."
00:58:39.974,00:58:43.061,That’s Chris Junior you’re talking about.
00:58:43.645,00:58:48.650,"Yeah, Christian got him that van for his 16th if he got all B’s."
00:58:49.150,00:58:52.320,"He flunked, but he got to keep it anyway."
00:58:52.403,00:58:53.905,Just sayin’.
00:58:55.156,00:58:56.950,Do you know where your son is now?
00:58:57.033,00:58:59.202,"Ooh, whoa. Stepson."
00:58:59.285,00:59:01.955,I have no idea where he is.
00:59:03.164,00:59:05.083,He got into drugs.
00:59:05.667,00:59:08.002,He was in jail a little bit for that.
00:59:08.086,00:59:11.673,And then he started hanging around with all the people he met in there.
00:59:11.756,00:59:13.633,Bunch of creeps.
00:59:14.133,00:59:16.386,His father recently cut him off.
00:59:16.469,00:59:19.973,"Canceled his ATM cards, everything."
00:59:20.557,00:59:25.895,"You know, TMI-- Chrissy always made me kinda nervous..."
00:59:26.479,00:59:28.523,even before all that.
00:59:28.606,00:59:30.358,Did you ever see The Omen?
00:59:30.942,00:59:33.027,That little kid.
00:59:33.111,00:59:34.362,Never know.
00:59:35.405,00:59:38.825,-He’d just throw you down the stairs. -The hell is this?
00:59:38.908,00:59:43.204,"Oh! Well, the police are asking about Chrissy."
00:59:44.914,00:59:47.041,Is that your shit box out front?
00:59:47.125,00:59:48.960,"-Yes, but-- -Hands!"
00:59:57.510,00:59:59.929,"-Don’t move. -Oh, my God."
01:00:03.975,01:00:05.935,-Meredith. -What?
01:00:06.811,01:00:08.605,-Are you retarded? -What?
01:00:09.188,01:00:11.691,Don’t you dare use the “R” word around me!
01:00:14.360,01:00:15.653,"Yeah, I know that."
01:00:16.821,01:00:20.241,-Then why are you talking to them? -Because I’m fucking bored!
01:00:23.244,01:00:26.497,You are lucky all we’re doing is talking.
01:00:26.581,01:00:29.125,"Don’t flatter yourself, baby."
01:00:29.208,01:00:30.460,"Walden Pond room, clear!"
01:00:30.543,01:00:33.713,"Well, I guess I will just get some soda for the rug."
01:00:37.634,01:00:39.260,We’re all clear.
01:00:46.559,01:00:48.603,Come home to this shit.
01:00:58.071,01:01:00.156,-Who are you? -I invoke the Fifth Amendment.
01:01:04.077,01:01:05.495,And why are you here?
01:01:06.496,01:01:09.540,Your son broke into my house and stole my stuff.
01:01:18.549,01:01:20.927,What does that have to do with me?
01:01:21.010,01:01:22.762,I thought he lived here.
01:01:22.845,01:01:25.014,"So you impersonate cops, why?"
01:01:26.933,01:01:30.269,To find him in case he wasn’t here.
01:01:30.353,01:01:31.979,To what end?
01:01:36.776,01:01:39.779,"“How dare you. Wah, wah.” Like that?"
01:01:40.446,01:01:43.616,Yeah. Yes. Exactly.
01:01:45.118,01:01:47.120,You can’t do that to people.
01:01:48.955,01:01:51.249,You say that like it means something.
01:01:52.083,01:01:59.298,"Look, I don’t condone my son’s behavior, but anyone can do anything if you let them."
01:02:00.258,01:02:01.467,Huh?
01:02:01.551,01:02:03.469,Welcome to the world.
01:02:05.012,01:02:07.181,I see why he turned out like he did.
01:02:10.184,01:02:11.686,You have kids?
01:02:14.021,01:02:18.109,"Uh-uh. So you have no idea what you’re talking about, do you?"
01:02:18.735,01:02:29.328,Christian has had more advantages and opportunities than 99.9% of the people on this planet.
01:02:29.412,01:02:31.456,And that’s because of me.
01:02:31.539,01:02:35.501,So don’t come to me with this nature-nurture horseshit.
01:02:35.585,01:02:37.670,All right? How much?
01:02:39.881,01:02:41.507,I don’t want a payoff.
01:02:42.175,01:02:45.219,"Well, then I’m confused. What do you want?"
01:02:47.221,01:02:51.058,For people to not be assholes.
01:02:56.689,01:02:57.982,Mm-hmm.
01:03:00.109,01:03:03.571,"Well, you know, it’s probably gonna stain."
01:03:06.949,01:03:10.661,-Are you gonna shoot us? -Don’t be so goddamned dramatic.
01:03:11.287,01:03:13.289,Then we’ll leave.
01:03:20.797,01:03:23.424,Thanks for the cappuccino. The foam was amazing.
01:03:23.508,01:03:25.510,You are very welcome.
01:03:31.390,01:03:35.645,"You can tell yourself you’ve done something here, if that’ll help."
01:03:35.728,01:03:37.939,Really took a stand.
01:03:38.022,01:03:41.859,"You know what? Guys like that, that’s just unhappiness eating ’em up."
01:04:04.882,01:04:06.342,What are you doing?
01:04:07.760,01:04:10.513,"No, no, not the giraffe. Not the giraffe!"
01:04:13.766,01:04:15.643,Put it-- Put the tiger down.
01:04:17.770,01:04:19.063,"Ruth, no, no. No, no, no."
01:04:24.402,01:04:26.904,"-Ruth, you gotta put that back. -I’m taking him."
01:04:26.988,01:04:28.823,Why?
01:04:41.335,01:04:42.837,The fuck?
01:04:44.088,01:04:47.550,"I mean, fuck it. Let’s just... do this. He’s finally there now."
01:04:47.633,01:04:50.678,I’m not doing a damn thing until I know their piece in this.
01:04:51.512,01:04:54.891,"They’re on us yesterday, they’re here today. She’s ripping up yard art."
01:04:54.974,01:04:56.976,You’re gonna tell me you’re comfortable with that?
01:04:57.059,01:04:58.686,-No. -Wha--?
01:05:02.064,01:05:04.734,We already got the security guy to think about.
01:05:05.192,01:05:07.862,You wanna walk into some kind of dog fuck?
01:05:07.945,01:05:09.030,Okay.
01:05:09.113,01:05:11.532,-Fine. What am I supposed to do about it? -Fuck.
01:05:12.116,01:05:13.326,Jesus.
01:05:14.160,01:05:16.203,-Jesus. Fucking Christ. -Shut up.
01:05:16.287,01:05:17.830,-Don’t fucking throw bottles at me. -Shut up.
01:05:29.008,01:05:30.509,What?
01:05:31.260,01:05:33.012,"What do you mean, what?"
01:05:33.095,01:05:35.097,What’s your problem?
01:05:37.308,01:05:39.268,That’s not your lawn tiger.
01:05:40.353,01:05:42.730,-Did you hear that guy? -I heard him.
01:05:42.813,01:05:47.526,"But he’s not the one that robbed your house, and that’s not your lawn tiger."
01:05:48.235,01:05:50.529,-If I’d known that this was gonna be-- -I get it.
01:05:50.613,01:05:52.615,"-You know, the objective-- -I get it."
01:05:52.698,01:05:54.533,-Of the mission-- -I get it.
01:05:58.329,01:06:00.665,-I wouldn’t have participated. -I get it.
01:06:03.918,01:06:06.170,Thanks for the backup in there.
01:06:06.253,01:06:07.254,The ba--?
01:06:08.255,01:06:10.424,All I’ve done is back you up.
01:06:10.508,01:06:11.884,Till now.
01:06:30.069,01:08:06.165,Tony-- What’d you tell my dad?
01:08:15.257,01:08:24.433,"No-- Oh, fuck."
01:08:32.650,01:08:41.158,"Oh, f-- -She’s calling, she’s calling. -I see it, I see it."
01:08:46.497,01:09:25.369,Hi. I just-- Someone broke into my house. He came out-- You have such beautiful black little eyes.
01:09:27.705,01:09:29.206,Okay.
01:10:09.163,01:10:11.373,He just ran right out.
01:10:25.387,01:10:26.722,Ruth?
01:10:31.727,01:10:33.312,Ruth?
01:10:54.959,01:10:56.585,You got it?
01:11:02.800,01:11:04.051,"You carry this one, okay?"
01:11:09.265,01:11:10.474,Which is on you.
01:11:11.350,01:11:14.520,I just-- It’s not gonna-- I think I should just stay here.
01:11:14.603,01:11:18.065,"I’m gonna be so quiet. I promise you, okay?"
01:11:18.148,01:11:20.067,"No, this is what’s gonna happen."
01:11:20.150,01:11:23.028,"You’re gonna carry this gun, you’re gonna get them to open the door."
01:11:23.112,01:11:25.948,"When they come to the door, point the gun at ’em so they don’t do anything."
01:11:26.031,01:11:27.825,I am not gonna be good at that.
01:11:35.624,01:11:38.043,How do I know that you’re not gonna--?
01:11:39.712,01:11:43.007,You know that I will if you don’t.
01:11:43.757,01:11:46.593,It’s karma. For Chrissy.
01:12:12.244,01:12:13.746,Yes?
01:12:16.790,01:12:20.252,"Hi, it’s-- it’s Ruth again. Sorry."
01:12:26.008,01:12:28.093,Please don’t do anything.
01:12:29.178,01:12:30.804,I’m compliant.
01:12:32.639,01:12:34.391,"Why? Why, why, why? Don’t."
01:12:35.476,01:12:36.393,Stop.
01:12:38.020,01:12:39.646,-You. -I’m so sorry.
01:12:39.730,01:12:43.275,-This is-- This is not my fault. -You took my tiger.
01:12:43.359,01:12:45.402,"-Yes, I did do that, but-- -You’re pointing a gun."
01:12:45.486,01:12:47.529,"-I know, I know, but-- -Shut up!"
01:12:47.613,01:12:49.615,"Meredith, do what they say."
01:12:59.166,01:13:01.460,"-Stop, stop. Don’t. Stop! -Sit the fuck down."
01:13:02.753,01:13:05.714,"-Stop. -Oh, my-- Don’t do that."
01:13:06.590,01:13:08.008,Okay.
01:13:09.676,01:13:12.346,-This is unbelievable. -Where is he?
01:13:12.429,01:13:14.348,He’s sleeping one off.
01:13:15.516,01:13:17.101,Call him.
01:13:17.184,01:13:21.271,"You know, if you’re here for what you think you’re here for, your timing stinks."
01:13:21.355,01:13:23.565,"Meredith, be quiet."
01:13:24.358,01:13:25.859,Call him.
01:13:31.532,01:13:34.701,Just... please. Please call him. Please.
01:13:38.956,01:13:40.582,"Oh, Chris!"
01:13:43.419,01:13:45.337,Chris!
01:13:47.714,01:13:49.133,Come here!
01:13:50.717,01:13:53.345,Come... here!
01:14:02.938,01:14:04.857,Is Christian here?
01:14:20.581,01:14:24.168,"Uh, maybe he’s waiting for you to come outside."
01:14:24.251,01:14:26.753,You know he doesn’t like me too much.
01:14:36.889,01:14:37.806,Cesar?
01:14:57.451,01:14:59.995,What the fuck is going on?
01:15:29.149,01:15:33.779,"Okay. Everybody, just hold it. Stop doing that."
01:15:45.791,01:15:47.417,I know you.
01:15:48.710,01:15:50.837,"Marshall, right?"
01:15:50.921,01:15:52.714,Your name is Marshall!
01:15:54.424,01:15:57.219,You were at one of Chrissy’s hearings last year.
01:16:00.556,01:16:02.182,Go ahead. Get in the fireplace.
01:16:02.266,01:16:04.560,What--? What did he tell you?
01:16:04.643,01:16:07.437,"That I keep cash around here, huh?"
01:16:07.521,01:16:09.606,I haven’t seen him in months.
01:16:09.690,01:16:12.776,"You amateurs, it’s not even here anymore."
01:16:12.859,01:16:14.361,Bullshit.
01:16:18.282,01:16:20.284,Get in the fireplace.
01:16:37.217,01:16:40.304,"Chrissy told us about the iron in there, so don’t even try that shit."
01:16:55.110,01:16:56.612,4-3-2-1.
01:17:10.917,01:17:14.046,They kidnapped me. They did this. You saw the gun was empty. You saw.
01:17:14.129,01:17:15.964,"Stop talking, bitch!"
01:17:16.465,01:17:18.342,-This is not-- -Shut up!
01:17:36.818,01:17:38.654,Where’s my son?
01:17:46.745,01:17:49.247,"You don’t have a son, buddy."
01:18:00.258,01:18:02.761,"-Guess that means we’re done here. -What? No, no. No."
01:18:02.844,01:18:04.096,Stop!
01:18:05.555,01:18:08.058,I’m not letting you shoot anyone.
01:18:11.228,01:18:12.854,Anyone-- Anyone else.
01:18:15.440,01:18:18.026,-You’re gonna have to kill me first. -Okay.
01:18:23.365,01:18:41.174,"Wh-- No, no, no! Ruth, Ruth!"
01:18:56.648,01:18:58.316,"Oh, Jesus."
01:19:03.029,01:19:04.239,Ow!
01:19:10.078,01:19:11.788,"Oh, God. Okay, quick. Come on."
01:19:16.251,01:19:18.754,-She got me good. -Come on.
01:19:25.844,01:19:28.054,"Hey. Hey, hey, hey."
01:19:38.315,01:19:39.941,"Tony, we can’t stop."
01:19:50.368,01:19:53.205,"Oh, you motherfuckers!"
01:19:55.749,01:19:58.335,"Tony, come on. Okay. Okay."
01:20:41.503,01:20:42.838,"Okay, we have to get up."
01:21:27.632,01:21:29.509,Tony? Tony?
01:21:29.593,01:21:31.803,Dude. Wake up.
01:21:31.887,01:21:33.513,"Hey, hey, hey."
01:21:33.597,01:21:36.433,"Don’t sleep. Don’t sleep, Tony."
01:21:36.516,01:21:37.601,"Tony, Tony!"
01:21:38.143,01:21:39.853,Don’t sleep.
01:21:59.080,01:22:00.874,I see you!
01:22:13.511,01:22:15.180,Tony? Dude?
01:22:15.263,01:22:16.431,Come on.
01:22:17.349,01:22:19.976,"Get up, Tony, please. Come on."
01:22:21.186,01:22:22.312,Tony.
01:22:23.229,01:22:25.023,"Wake up, Tony. Come on."
01:22:33.907,01:22:35.241,Listen.
01:22:35.951,01:22:38.495,Just apply pressure. Keep pressure.
01:22:46.878,01:22:48.880,"Hey, fuck-face!"
01:22:57.180,01:23:00.141,I’m gonna get you! Better run! Keep running!
01:23:01.059,01:23:03.979,"Here, kitty! Kitty, kitty!"
01:23:04.062,01:23:05.480,How fast can you run?
01:23:06.606,01:23:09.567,Ha-ha. Run. Run!
01:23:47.147,01:23:49.983,I see you! I’m gonna get you!
01:24:15.425,01:24:17.677,Why don’t you just leave me alone?
01:24:18.303,01:24:20.597,Why don’t I just leave you alone?
01:24:20.680,01:24:22.682,Sure. Okay. All right.
01:24:22.766,01:24:25.226,Sure. Why don’t you come down here?
01:24:29.481,01:24:30.732,And we’ll shake on it.
01:24:45.705,01:24:46.706,Some.
01:24:47.499,01:24:49.918,-Yeah? -Yeah.
01:24:52.587,01:24:54.756,They look fucking stupid.
01:24:56.424,01:24:58.009,What the fuck do you know?
01:24:58.093,01:24:59.719,Have you ever eaten cat meat?
01:25:05.767,01:25:07.519,You mean cat food?
01:25:10.021,01:25:11.523,No.
01:25:13.274,01:25:16.277,The meat... of a cat.
01:25:19.864,01:25:21.574,"No. No, man."
01:25:22.700,01:25:24.786,I never ate any cat meat.
01:25:28.289,01:25:31.209,"Well, it makes you invisible. Did you know that?"
01:25:47.517,01:25:48.726,I see you.
01:25:48.810,01:25:50.019,Fucking weirdo.
01:26:02.073,01:26:03.700,Fuck!
01:26:03.783,01:26:05.869,Damn it! No!

01:28:17.625,01:28:23.339,"Oh, and by the way, my wife and I are gonna give it another shot."
01:29:20.146,01:29:20.980,You okay?
01:29:27.653,01:29:29.572,Yeah.
01:29:29.655,01:29:31.699,"Just be gentle with yourself, all right?"
01:29:32.492,01:29:34.660,You got all the time in the world.
01:29:38.498,01:29:40.583,I don’t know what that means.
01:29:42.460,01:29:44.545,"Yeah, it’s just something people say."
