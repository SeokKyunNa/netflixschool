00:00:22.647,00:00:28.903,"At this point, I recommend that you see a specialist, and I can help you with a recommendation and get you a list of people."
00:00:29.529,00:00:30.697,And then go from there.
00:00:40.290,00:00:42.667,-That's the cancer one? -Yes.
00:00:45.879,00:00:50.508,"-So, you think it's bad? -We don't really know, which is why I think it's important for you to see a specialist."
00:00:50.592,00:00:53.553,"He'll do a biopsy, more tests and..."
00:00:53.636,00:00:55.805,What do you think though? What do you think about it?
00:00:55.889,00:00:57.515,You've seen it and all. What do you think?
00:00:57.599,00:01:00.185,"-Do you know how bad it is? -At this point, I don't really know."
00:01:00.268,00:01:03.313,"But you can tell us something, right? Can you tell us something?"
00:01:04.898,00:01:09.319,"-I don't think she-- -She doesn't-- I think... I think... How about... All right, listen."
00:01:09.402,00:01:11.905,How about this? How about I'm gonna make a statement?
00:01:11.988,00:01:14.949,"And if it's a true statement, you don't have to correct me."
00:01:16.201,00:01:18.411,And you don't have to say anything to me.
00:01:19.370,00:01:22.874,Okay? So is what Michael has...
00:01:24.084,00:01:25.502,incurable?
00:01:25.585,00:01:29.756,"Dude, that's a question. You gotta... It has to be-- It has to be a statement. All right."
00:01:29.839,00:01:30.924,"So, my statement is..."
00:01:31.049,00:01:33.259,-what Michael has is incurable. -That's it.
00:01:35.804,00:01:38.181,Do you understand the game? 'Cause you're not saying anything.
00:01:38.264,00:01:40.350,I don't know if that's... I don't know...
00:01:40.433,00:01:42.685,if that's cause you understand what we...
00:01:42.769,00:01:44.437,Did you see All the President's Men?
00:01:45.188,00:01:49.526,"Um, remind me of your relationship. How do you know each other?"
00:01:51.027,00:01:51.861,Oh. Uh...
00:01:51.945,00:01:54.030,"-We're, uh... We're neighbors. -Yeah."
00:01:54.531,00:01:56.282,-Okay. -I live on top of him.
00:02:22.767,00:02:23.977,Hold on.
00:02:26.187,00:02:28.940,Hold on. Go.
00:03:38.218,00:03:40.220,"that, uh, cancer thing."
00:03:40.678,00:03:43.431,-What happened with the specialist guy? -He was special.
00:03:46.100,00:03:47.352,"All right. Come on, Michael."
00:03:52.273,00:03:53.816,Don't... Don't drop it!
00:04:19.050,00:04:21.928,I'll... tell you what happened at lunch today.
00:04:23.388,00:04:25.598,I was at the diner next to my office.
00:04:25.682,00:04:26.641,Yeah.
00:04:27.183,00:04:29.811,"I had that booth by the window, and..."
00:04:30.395,00:04:33.481,this guy floats by the window. Guy just floats by the window.
00:04:36.192,00:04:38.820,"I mean, he floats. I mean, I just see... I can't see his bottom."
00:04:38.903,00:04:39.821,Yeah.
00:04:39.904,00:04:42.448,His bottom ain't moving. You can tell he's not moving. You know...
00:04:43.324,00:04:44.575,He floated by the window.
00:04:46.119,00:04:48.830,-He was probably on a hover board. -Skateboard?
00:04:48.913,00:04:55.044,"No, that... You know, those things those kids do. They put it on their feet-- Yeah, I know he was on a hover board but it just started me thinking."
00:04:55.128,00:04:56.713,Just saw a guy hover.
00:04:56.796,00:04:59.507,Can you imagine that? That would screw up your whole life.
00:05:00.091,00:05:01.384,"So, he hovered? So what?"
00:05:02.218,00:05:04.721,"If you saw a guy hover, so what?"
00:05:04.804,00:05:06.472,"Yeah, so a guy hovers."
00:05:06.556,00:05:09.350,"So, life's normal for you right after that?"
00:05:09.434,00:05:11.060,I don't have a problem with it.
00:05:11.853,00:05:19.902,"So, all rules of reality, thousands of years of science, everything, now means nothing? It means nothing?"
00:05:20.611,00:05:21.904,"I'll be like, cool."
00:05:22.488,00:05:25.408,You wouldn't be cool. You wouldn't be cool if a guy...
00:05:25.491,00:05:26.701,Of course I would.
00:05:26.784,00:05:29.037,"No, you wouldn't. If there was no rules."
00:05:29.620,00:05:32.582,"You go to put your sneakers on, and they're pumpkins."
00:05:33.082,00:05:34.834,"You blow your nose, a nickel comes out."
00:05:34.917,00:05:37.128,"You look in the mirror, your face is a..."
00:05:37.628,00:05:39.005,Is a peg board.
00:05:39.088,00:05:40.214,-I'm fine with that. -Yeah.
00:05:40.298,00:05:42.342,I know you're bullshitting. Give me my thing.
00:05:42.925,00:05:44.927,My hands are airplanes so just don't look.
00:05:45.011,00:05:50.058,"Yeah. Well, get on one of them and fly to fucking where guys don't hover."
00:05:50.641,00:05:52.185,Because that's where I live.
00:05:54.395,00:05:56.773,What are you doing? That's the death punch.
00:05:58.149,00:05:59.567,Master! No!
00:06:20.380,00:06:22.965,"Your death punch is extremely powerful, huh?"
00:06:23.049,00:06:26.177,"Had I landed the punch, your fate would be sealed."
00:06:26.928,00:06:31.015,"Three steps in any direction, and your heart would explode."
00:06:31.099,00:06:32.141,And then you'd be dead.
00:06:37.105,00:06:38.064,Let's go eat.
00:06:43.027,00:06:44.362,"There was, uh..."
00:06:44.445,00:06:47.615,-There was five. I took three. -That's not okay.
00:06:47.698,00:06:50.451,"One's a... One's dwarf one, so it evens out."
00:06:50.952,00:06:52.620,Sure hope to see you tomorrow night.
00:06:54.205,00:06:56.624,"Yeah, Trivial Pursuit. I won the last two of those."
00:06:56.707,00:06:57.875,"Have a good night, Andy."
00:07:30.324,00:07:31.242,Good morning.
00:07:35.413,00:07:36.330,Thank you.
00:07:37.999,00:07:40.751,"Sir, that's, uh...That's my pen."
00:07:41.878,00:07:42.753,Thank you.
00:07:48.718,00:07:49.594,Hi.
00:07:50.261,00:07:51.095,Andy?
00:07:51.721,00:07:52.805,Hmm.
00:07:52.889,00:07:54.891,-Hi. -Hi. How are you?
00:07:57.310,00:07:59.020,I'm okay. I'm okay.
00:07:59.103,00:08:00.646,"-Yeah? -Yeah, sure."
00:08:01.355,00:08:02.857,Did you have a good weekend?
00:08:02.940,00:08:04.692,-My... My weekend? -Mm-hmm.
00:08:49.237,00:08:51.989,Uh-huh. And what are my options?
00:08:58.704,00:08:59.789,I see.
00:09:59.140,00:10:01.767,What have I done?
00:10:44.101,00:10:45.186,I could give a...
00:10:46.145,00:10:47.021,a great...
00:10:47.605,00:10:50.066,half-time speech if I was a coach. I...
00:10:50.691,00:10:53.361,I really have this best speech I've ever heard at half-time.
00:10:56.238,00:10:57.657,I think it's fatty pork.
00:10:58.199,00:11:00.117,It's not fatty pork. I...
00:11:00.826,00:11:03.496,-I made the shirt. I know it's not-- -You made it about two years ago.
00:11:03.579,00:11:08.042,"-You still remember what it is? -It was a year and a half ago, and if it was fatty pork, there'd be two T's."
00:11:08.125,00:11:09.794,There'd be another T right there.
00:11:10.544,00:11:13.714,It's a satay fork. Little fork. Little appetizer fork.
00:11:13.798,00:11:16.425,"No, it's not-- Nothing in the kitchen. Get out of the kitchen."
00:11:17.426,00:11:19.970,"I'll give you that info, and that's it."
00:11:21.180,00:11:23.557,That's a good one. That was a year and a half...
00:11:25.559,00:11:29.188,Sort of think... I like that it bothers you.
00:11:30.898,00:11:34.110,Did you eat my cashews? I have no cashews left.
00:11:38.531,00:11:39.949,I just got walnuts.
00:11:47.164,00:11:49.333,I could tell you. Want me to tell you?
00:11:50.584,00:11:52.545,I saw the oncologist and...
00:11:55.548,00:11:57.925,"I saw a second oncologist. He, um..."
00:12:03.931,00:12:05.683,"Long story, but they, um..."
00:12:06.517,00:12:08.227,"You know, there's nothing they can do."
00:12:09.520,00:12:10.521,So...
00:12:14.775,00:12:15.693,It's that.
00:12:17.194,00:12:18.529,The dying part is...
00:12:21.323,00:12:23.325,Meh. It's meh.
00:12:27.288,00:12:31.834,"The hospital, the tubes, the bloating. I don't want any part of that."
00:12:35.254,00:12:36.589,"So, I'm thinking..."
00:12:40.426,00:12:41.427,before...
00:12:42.636,00:12:43.971,before it gets bad...
00:12:47.057,00:12:48.100,I want to...
00:12:49.310,00:12:50.269,end it...
00:12:50.978,00:12:54.315,They got a whole process. If you get less than six months they give you this...
00:12:55.274,00:12:56.484,these pills you can take.
00:12:57.359,00:12:58.736,And you can do it at home.
00:12:58.819,00:12:59.779,Sounds...
00:13:00.404,00:13:01.322,You know.
00:13:01.822,00:13:03.949,But I don't want to do it alone and...
00:13:06.994,00:13:08.579,I was hoping you would help me out.
00:13:13.459,00:13:14.293,Me?
00:13:18.130,00:13:19.256,Uh...
00:13:20.382,00:13:21.634,Do... I mean...
00:13:25.221,00:13:26.263,The way...
00:13:28.933,00:13:31.644,You gotta... You can't give up. Huh? You gotta...
00:13:32.728,00:13:35.606,"You can't do that. Miracles happen, right?"
00:13:37.274,00:13:40.444,"What about the guys who say, You got six months to live and..."
00:13:40.528,00:13:42.905,"next thing you know, he's climbing Mount Everest."
00:13:43.531,00:13:46.325,Jim Abbott had one arm. Remember Jim Abbott on the Yankees?
00:13:46.408,00:13:47.409,He had one arm.
00:13:47.827,00:13:48.994,He pitched a no-hitter.
00:13:49.787,00:13:50.913,He didn't give up.
00:13:52.289,00:13:53.833,"You don't give up, Michael."
00:13:56.168,00:13:57.711,They already gave me the prescription.
00:13:59.547,00:14:01.549,They can do that? They can just give you that...
00:14:02.258,00:14:03.634,medicine that kills you?
00:14:03.717,00:14:04.552,Yeah.
00:14:07.888,00:14:09.598,I don't want you to look at me like this.
00:14:11.851,00:14:15.771,"But I was not gonna tell you 'cause I didn't want it to change things, you know?"
00:14:18.691,00:14:19.525,You know...
00:14:20.568,00:14:21.861,I want to make some pizzas.
00:14:23.028,00:14:24.488,I want to watch some movies.
00:14:26.240,00:14:27.741,I want to play some Paddleton.
00:14:28.409,00:14:29.243,You know?
00:14:41.171,00:14:42.047,Yeah?
00:14:42.590,00:14:43.465,Okay.
00:14:50.306,00:14:51.640,Should we play the second half?
00:14:52.182,00:14:53.350,"Yeah, right? We gotta."
00:14:58.939,00:14:59.773,Lay it out.
00:15:24.173,00:15:27.343,The places where your doctor said we could fulfill the...
00:15:28.218,00:15:29.887,prescription. The closest one is...
00:15:30.763,00:15:31.764,almost six hours.
00:15:31.847,00:15:33.182,-Six hours? -Yeah.
00:15:36.018,00:15:38.145,"All right, Guess we're gonna do a little road trip."
00:15:38.228,00:15:39.563,What does that mean? Road trip?
00:15:41.649,00:15:43.108,"You don't just do a road trip, right?"
00:15:44.151,00:15:45.611,"What do you mean, what does that mean?"
00:15:45.694,00:15:48.906,"We'll drive there. We'll get the meds, we'll find a place..."
00:15:48.989,00:15:52.284,Your stove burnt the pizza up. It's burnt.
00:15:52.785,00:15:53.619,Fuck!
00:15:55.871,00:15:57.831,It's ruined now. It's ruined.
00:15:59.416,00:16:01.418,We can't eat that. We gotta eat something else.
00:16:04.213,00:16:06.423,-Nice work. -Look at that piece of shit!
00:16:06.507,00:16:07.841,"Ah, this is fucked!"
00:16:08.467,00:16:09.593,You gonna eat that still?
00:16:24.817,00:16:25.776,Grab a plate.
00:16:29.905,00:16:31.031,I'll try it.
00:16:31.115,00:16:32.074,All right.
00:16:41.375,00:16:43.502,There's no such thing as too much air.
00:16:43.585,00:16:44.920,"Oh, yeah there is."
00:16:45.921,00:16:46.922,Huh?
00:16:47.965,00:16:49.341,How about the Hindenberg?
00:16:50.175,00:16:51.343,That was helium.
00:16:51.427,00:16:53.429,"Yeah, but it was too much."
00:17:13.115,00:17:15.534,"I see everything. Yeah, I do. There's a tree. There's a..."
00:17:16.160,00:17:17.036,What's that?
00:17:17.995,00:17:19.329,A person or a chicken.
00:17:19.788,00:17:21.373,If you had to live like this...
00:17:21.832,00:17:25.085,You could adapt. That's the great thing about the human mind.
00:17:25.502,00:17:27.629,This is how bees see.
00:17:34.053,00:17:37.598,one of those wishes would be sand off?
00:17:37.681,00:17:38.640,What's sand off?
00:17:38.724,00:17:40.976,Whenever you said sand off...
00:17:41.894,00:17:45.606,every grain of sand that was on your body fell off.
00:17:47.649,00:17:49.026,"Twelve hundred, maybe?"
00:17:49.109,00:17:51.695,"No, ten. If they gave me ten, I would do it."
00:17:51.779,00:17:55.991,You can only think of nine wishes before you get to sand off?
00:17:56.075,00:17:57.493,How many you need?
00:17:57.576,00:17:59.078,"Okay, uh..."
00:17:59.161,00:18:00.079,your first one.
00:18:00.788,00:18:02.122,All the cancer's gone.
00:18:02.873,00:18:05.209,"Then a billion dollars, flying, whatever."
00:18:05.292,00:18:06.376,Invisible.
00:18:06.460,00:18:09.671,"Invisible, and then sand off, yeah. Well, pajamas on."
00:18:09.755,00:18:13.300,"Pajamas... It's late at night, you're tired. Pajamas on."
00:18:17.179,00:18:18.472,"Well, not that big a buffer."
00:18:18.555,00:18:20.516,What's the worst case scenario? We run out of gas.
00:18:20.599,00:18:23.268,"What's the worst case scenario? We run out of gas here, right?"
00:18:24.019,00:18:26.021,"Next thing you know, we're drinking our urine."
00:18:27.439,00:18:31.652,"How do you get from running out of gas, the next step is drinking urine?"
00:18:31.735,00:18:33.529,You can hitchhike. You can...
00:18:33.612,00:18:35.614,We'll call somebody. We'll walk to the gas station.
00:18:35.697,00:18:38.325,-There's nobody out here. -You go right to drinking urine.
00:18:42.913,00:18:44.081,It's good.
00:18:44.540,00:18:45.541,"Oh, yeah?"
00:18:45.624,00:18:50.295,"I could sell it. But if I told it to a coach, they'd want to buy it from me."
00:18:50.921,00:18:52.673,"Hey, guys, gather around."
00:18:53.590,00:18:55.134,That's how it starts. Yeah.
00:18:57.678,00:18:58.887,That's it.
00:19:11.942,00:19:13.193,"She knows, right?"
00:19:14.236,00:19:17.865,"She knows about the cancer, but not about the other stuff."
00:19:18.782,00:19:20.534,I kind of want to keep that to myself.
00:19:22.035,00:19:22.911,Oh.
00:19:24.037,00:19:25.164,What about me?
00:19:25.622,00:19:27.040,"No, that's..."
00:19:27.833,00:19:29.376,"That's different. That's, you know..."
00:19:31.628,00:19:32.713,Yeah.
00:19:33.255,00:19:35.174,-You know? -Yeah.
00:19:35.257,00:19:36.091,Yeah.
00:19:37.509,00:19:38.427,I get it.
00:19:40.387,00:19:42.389,"She does small talk, your sister?"
00:19:42.472,00:19:43.682,Hmm.
00:19:43.765,00:19:44.975,The queen.
00:19:45.058,00:19:45.934,Yeah.
00:19:47.144,00:19:49.521,Ooh. Ostrich farm. Three miles.
00:19:49.605,00:19:51.690,"-Uh, yeah. -We're doing that."
00:19:52.608,00:19:54.443,Eh... You want to?
00:19:55.068,00:19:57.446,-I've never seen an ostrich. -I've seen them.
00:19:57.529,00:19:59.865,"-I've seen them on TV. -Yeah, but in person, though."
00:19:59.948,00:20:02.409,"They're kind of nasty, though."
00:20:03.160,00:20:04.953,-Really? -They'll run right at you.
00:20:15.130,00:20:17.591,"Fastest land animal, actually."
00:20:19.676,00:20:21.386,-I don't think it is. -Yeah.
00:20:21.470,00:20:23.472,"Yes, it is. Forty miles an hour."
00:20:26.141,00:20:27.434,The cheetah goes...
00:20:28.435,00:20:30.103,60 or 65.
00:20:30.604,00:20:32.606,Yeah. That's four legs.
00:20:36.610,00:20:37.486,Per leg...
00:20:41.114,00:20:42.074,they're the fastest.
00:21:36.461,00:21:39.589,"We talk to the guy, Phil, and we got a plan, right? Okay."
00:21:39.673,00:21:43.760,This sinus infection is so awful.
00:21:45.846,00:21:49.891,I feel like this medication I've taken before and it hasn't worked.
00:21:49.975,00:21:51.977,"-Give it a try, okay? -Okay."
00:21:52.060,00:21:53.979,-Have a good rest of the day. -Thank you.
00:21:54.062,00:21:55.564,"All right. Bye, bye, Judy."
00:21:57.566,00:21:59.192,"Hi, guys. What can I do for you?"
00:21:59.276,00:22:01.820,"Hi, there. We're here to see Phil."
00:22:01.903,00:22:04.740,Phil's not in today. I'm Dave. I'm standing in for Phil.
00:22:05.657,00:22:07.909,We talked to Phil though. You spoke to Phil.
00:22:07.993,00:22:09.661,"Yeah, we, uh... But..."
00:22:10.287,00:22:13.081,-Okay. So we should come back. -But I can help you guys.
00:22:13.165,00:22:14.541,"Yeah, but this is something..."
00:22:16.626,00:22:19.046,-This is kind of top secret. -I spoke to Phil. It's a...
00:22:19.129,00:22:21.840,He was gonna... It's a special medication he was gonna...
00:22:21.923,00:22:24.259,-Are you Michael Thompson? -I'm Michael. Yeah.
00:22:24.343,00:22:25.969,You want to call Phil maybe?
00:22:26.053,00:22:28.680,It's okay. I can handle it. Yeah.
00:22:28.764,00:22:30.015,Michael Thompson.
00:22:30.098,00:22:32.726,I don't like that. We should come back for Phil. Let's come back.
00:22:37.314,00:22:40.400,Give me one second. I'll get you guys dialed in here.
00:22:40.942,00:22:42.611,All right. How are you guys doing today?
00:22:47.491,00:22:51.036,-There are three medicines involved. -We know all this part.
00:22:51.119,00:22:52.788,This is what we did with Phil. That's why...
00:22:52.871,00:22:53.705,Phil told us.
00:22:53.789,00:22:56.917,If Phil was here he wouldn't say that to us 'cause we already spoke to him about it.
00:22:57.000,00:23:00.504,"I understand, but Phil told me I had to read these instructions."
00:23:00.921,00:23:03.006,It's protocol.
00:23:03.465,00:23:04.549,"-Okay, go ahead. -Thank you."
00:23:04.633,00:23:08.553,"Okay, so you'll be taking two of these one hour before taking the drink."
00:23:09.054,00:23:10.722,This one is for anxiety.
00:23:11.264,00:23:14.142,This one is for nausea. It'll keep you from vomiting.
00:23:14.684,00:23:16.395,And this one ran all the way home.
00:23:20.315,00:23:30.450,"Um, and in the event of vomiting after ingesting the drink, the patient should have a family member contact their referring physician to determine a course of action."
00:23:31.243,00:23:32.494,This big one...
00:23:33.995,00:23:35.997,is the medicine you'll be taking last.
00:23:36.540,00:23:43.171,"There are 100 pills in this bottle, Can you ring it up now?"
00:23:43.588,00:23:45.090,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on."
00:23:45.173,00:23:46.800,"-You're not paying for this. -Oh, no. Yeah."
00:23:46.883,00:23:48.927,"I didn't tell you about this, but here, take the card."
00:23:49.010,00:23:51.138,"-Take the card and ring it up. -Andy, it's $3,500."
00:23:51.221,00:23:53.432,I know what it is. I have more money than you.
00:23:53.515,00:23:55.142,-I want to do this. -It's a lot.
00:23:55.225,00:23:56.226,I want to do it.
00:23:57.185,00:23:58.103,Let me do it.
00:23:59.354,00:24:00.230,Thank you.
00:24:04.901,00:24:07.112,It's not declined. You gotta put it through.
00:24:07.195,00:24:08.697,-You gotta run it through. -Nice one.
00:24:08.780,00:24:10.574,-Okay. -Can you run it through again?
00:24:10.657,00:24:12.451,My mistake. I'll give it another shot.
00:24:12.534,00:24:14.661,You know that those things glitch a lot.
00:24:15.579,00:24:17.205,"-Sorry, declined again. -Give me the card."
00:24:17.289,00:24:18.957,-Give me the card. -I'll pay for it.
00:24:19.040,00:24:21.626,"I'm just gonna call the bank up, that's all."
00:24:21.710,00:24:24.004,-I can pay for it and you pay me back. -Give me your phone.
00:24:24.087,00:24:29.176,"Give me your phone. Don't ring anything up, 'cause this'll take one second. I'm gonna call the number right there."
00:24:29.259,00:24:32.596,I see the number right there. Give me one second. Don't ring anything up.
00:24:33.638,00:24:40.979,You will have to empty the contents of all 100 pills into a glass -and mix them with half a cup of water. -It's Andy Freedman.
00:24:41.062,00:24:45.150,"The drink will be a little bitter, but you want to drink it all at once."
00:24:47.444,00:24:48.820,I am out of town.
00:24:51.448,00:24:52.991,You don't...
00:24:53.074,00:25:06.379,"want to end their life after ingesting ...they must contact emergency medical services -I'll stop yelling, but I'm not yelling. -Yeah."
00:25:06.463,00:25:07.506,Mm-hmm.
00:25:10.759,00:25:11.885,I don't have a phone.
00:25:13.345,00:25:15.013,That's why you're supposed to have a phone.
00:25:16.014,00:25:19.142,I have e-mail. Can I see my e-mail on your e-mail?
00:25:19.726,00:25:22.229,"Uh, Phil has his log-in codes. I don't have it."
00:25:22.312,00:25:31.112,"See? Why don't we wait for Phil? Let's just wait for Phil to come back, -And none of this happens. -It's gonna be fine Hold on. I sent you my pet name about five years ago."
00:25:31.196,00:25:32.489,Is that it? Are we done?
00:25:32.948,00:25:34.699,"Yes, yes. Uh, yeah, I read it all."
00:25:37.536,00:25:39.120,-Where does it go? -He's okay?
00:25:40.747,00:25:41.623,No!
00:25:45.961,00:25:46.795,What are you doing?
00:25:47.337,00:25:49.339,What do you mean? I'm taking a pain pill.
00:25:49.839,00:25:50.966,I don't know. I just...
00:25:52.217,00:25:53.343,I thought it was...
00:25:55.929,00:25:57.097,Can I help you?
00:25:59.057,00:26:01.518,"Hi, we have a reservation for..."
00:26:02.102,00:26:04.020,-Freedman. -Okay.
00:26:04.104,00:26:05.272,I have it right here.
00:26:05.355,00:26:07.190,"-No, I got it. -Printed it out."
00:26:07.274,00:26:08.149,Here you are.
00:26:08.233,00:26:10.610,You're all set. I just need a credit card for incidentals...
00:26:10.694,00:26:19.411,"Okay. I'm gonna give you a credit card, but if you could wait until the end to do whatever you have to do with it. I'll call the bank, -and it's all gonna be fine. -Let me just..."
00:26:20.036,00:26:21.079,I'll get this one.
00:26:23.957,00:26:25.083,It's all going down.
00:26:25.166,00:26:28.003,"-I'm gonna pay it all back, okay? -That's fine."
00:26:28.086,00:26:30.046,"-It's 79 a night, yes? -It is."
00:26:30.630,00:26:31.590,Every penny.
00:26:31.673,00:26:32.841,All... I'm keeping...
00:26:35.427,00:26:37.053,"So, guys, I got you, um..."
00:26:37.762,00:26:38.847,two queens.
00:26:38.930,00:26:40.348,-Um... -Right.
00:26:40.890,00:26:42.475,We have another room with a king.
00:26:43.268,00:26:44.352,We don't want two rooms.
00:26:44.436,00:26:47.647,I'm sorry. Not two rooms. Would you prefer to have a king?
00:26:51.192,00:26:53.194,"If you feel more comfortable, we're fine with that."
00:26:54.946,00:26:55.947,The queens are good.
00:27:21.890,00:27:23.975,"Guess I'll take that then, right?"
00:27:27.395,00:27:29.814,Keep it in my house just so we know where it is.
00:27:38.323,00:27:39.282,"I mean, I..."
00:27:40.325,00:27:41.159,I just...
00:27:41.868,00:27:44.537,"Just assumed, you know, I'd hold onto it."
00:27:46.498,00:27:50.168,"I got a safe place in my closet. Up behind the, uh..."
00:27:51.419,00:27:52.545,the box. I have that...
00:27:53.755,00:27:55.882,The Rod Carew rookie card. I got that little...
00:27:57.384,00:27:59.386,I don't think anybody's gonna steal it.
00:28:05.225,00:28:07.227,They always go to the ground floor first.
00:28:07.310,00:28:09.688,I'm up on top. If the water main breaks...
00:28:10.146,00:28:14.442,"over on Hillside and then it floods, I'm up top."
00:29:40.987,00:29:42.822,-Cash or charge? -Cash.
00:30:06.679,00:30:07.555,Yeah.
00:30:10.308,00:30:12.268,"I slept for a long time, sorry."
00:30:12.352,00:30:14.729,I know. It's all right.
00:30:23.863,00:30:24.864,What's this?
00:30:26.157,00:30:27.158,Tree of Wisdom.
00:30:28.868,00:30:29.702,Andy.
00:30:35.041,00:30:35.875,"Oh, yeah."
00:30:37.043,00:30:38.169,"Yeah, that's, uh..."
00:30:39.546,00:30:41.089,Now we got nothing to worry about.
00:30:43.341,00:30:44.926,Nothing can go wrong now.
00:30:48.304,00:30:50.181,It's very funny.
00:30:50.265,00:30:52.016,It's not funny. That's a good idea.
00:30:52.517,00:30:54.352,Where's the medication? Where is it?
00:30:54.853,00:30:55.728,It's in there.
00:30:56.479,00:30:57.397,It's locked up.
00:30:57.480,00:31:00.441,We don't got to worry about any of that stuff we were talking about.
00:31:03.653,00:31:04.529,What's the code?
00:31:06.281,00:31:07.198,The code to what?
00:31:14.956,00:31:16.249,There's a combination.
00:31:17.083,00:31:17.959,Okay.
00:31:19.419,00:31:20.753,What's the combination?
00:31:21.880,00:31:22.797,No hints.
00:31:23.715,00:31:25.550,"Andy, I don't want to play a game right now."
00:31:25.633,00:31:28.303,"-Can you give me the code? -No, just don't worry about it."
00:31:29.262,00:31:30.513,This is the end here.
00:31:52.327,00:31:55.580,"Honestly, if you don't want to do anything, it's just gonna be more of me."
00:32:01.461,00:32:02.629,We should drink more.
00:32:03.212,00:32:04.213,Right?
00:32:04.881,00:32:06.341,I think I'm gonna start drinking.
00:32:06.925,00:32:09.344,"Yeah. I mean, it's not good for you, but it is good."
00:32:11.054,00:32:12.180,"So, you feeling ready?"
00:32:13.181,00:32:14.265,Coach?
00:32:14.891,00:32:16.643,-My speech? -Half-time speech.
00:32:16.726,00:32:19.187,It's not ready yet. I don't want to jinx it.
00:32:19.270,00:32:20.396,Hmm.
00:32:20.480,00:32:22.857,I stumbled on something that's really gonna be something.
00:32:24.859,00:32:26.736,"-Hey, Andy? -Yeah."
00:32:28.154,00:32:29.656,Is there a half-time speech?
00:32:30.949,00:32:33.868,You think I'm lying about that? Why would I lie about it?
00:32:33.952,00:32:36.329,Remember that time you told me you spoke Spanish and then...
00:32:36.412,00:32:42.126,"I over-exaggerated how much I knew, but that's because I was trying to impress you. We weren't friends yet."
00:32:42.710,00:32:43.753,I got to pee.
00:32:45.004,00:32:46.506,-Definitely get another one. -Okay.
00:32:46.589,00:32:48.216,"All right, I'll be back."
00:32:56.641,00:32:57.850,"Gather round, guys."
00:32:58.685,00:32:59.811,"Gather round, guys."
00:33:01.312,00:33:02.271,Take a knee.
00:33:03.106,00:33:04.691,Everybody just take a knee.
00:33:05.942,00:33:07.944,"Do me a favor, guys. Close your eyes."
00:33:08.945,00:33:10.238,I want you to close your eyes.
00:33:10.947,00:33:13.366,"Everybody, close your eyes. I want you to picture something."
00:33:16.369,00:33:17.704,We're gonna lose this game.
00:33:18.705,00:33:20.248,"We're gonna lose this game, guys."
00:33:20.873,00:33:22.875,Just listen to me. I'm not gonna lie to you.
00:33:23.793,00:33:25.378,The momentum has switched.
00:33:25.461,00:33:26.713,That's a better team.
00:33:27.255,00:33:29.882,"No matter what I say here, that ain't gonna turn it around."
00:33:29.966,00:33:31.968,We're gonna lose this game.
00:33:32.552,00:33:34.554,But so what? I'm proud of you.
00:33:35.263,00:33:39.892,I'm proud of you. I don't want to wait to the end when you're hurting to say that. You guy's are...
00:33:39.976,00:33:41.686,You don't need this game.
00:33:41.769,00:33:44.564,You're gonna have good lives. You're all good guys. You're gonna...
00:33:44.647,00:33:46.441,You're gonna be something in your life.
00:33:46.524,00:33:48.860,"Murphy, you're gonna be in the Navy, right?"
00:33:48.943,00:33:50.653,You're gonna be a hero one day.
00:33:52.196,00:33:53.656,"Cahill, you're a writer."
00:33:54.657,00:33:55.867,You're gonna live somewhere...
00:33:55.950,00:33:57.577,You're gonna live in Connecticut somewhere.
00:33:58.411,00:33:59.454,By the water.
00:34:00.288,00:34:03.583,"And you'll have a drinking problem maybe, but that makes you a better writer."
00:34:05.418,00:34:06.794,It's all gonna be okay.
00:34:08.504,00:34:11.466,"You're gonna have great lives, and maybe you're gonna have a..."
00:34:12.675,00:34:15.511,a little empty feeling in your gut.
00:34:19.098,00:34:21.851,"And maybe when you lay at night, secretly you're gonna think..."
00:34:24.270,00:34:25.188,You know what?
00:34:26.022,00:34:27.065,If I could go back...
00:34:28.524,00:34:30.985,"This is all good, but if I could ever go back..."
00:34:31.569,00:34:37.700,If I could go back in time I would go to the day we lost that big game and I would play that second half over again.
00:34:37.784,00:34:40.995,"Well, guess what guys? Open your eyes! You're back!"
00:35:00.473,00:35:02.058,-Hey. -Hey.
00:35:02.642,00:35:03.559,How did this...
00:35:03.643,00:35:04.477,What's going on?
00:35:04.560,00:35:08.189,He was alone. Nobody likes to be alone. I invited him.
00:35:09.148,00:35:11.192,"Okay, all right. So, now you're over here now?"
00:35:11.776,00:35:13.861,"-Yeah, have a little-- -Get out of my seat."
00:35:18.324,00:35:19.408,"-Cheers, guys. -Cheers."
00:35:19.492,00:35:21.410,"-Oh, yeah. -New friends."
00:35:24.580,00:35:27.208,"So, David was telling me he's a kung fu fan."
00:35:27.291,00:35:28.960,-Yeah. -Mm-hmm.
00:35:29.043,00:35:30.461,"We were talking, so..."
00:35:30.545,00:35:33.131,"Oh, yeah. Of course. You're that too."
00:35:33.214,00:35:35.508,-All right. -Yeah. I like kung fu. You like kung fu?
00:35:35.591,00:35:36.509,Everybody likes...
00:35:36.592,00:35:38.469,"Well, have you watched Death Punch?"
00:35:39.095,00:35:40.429,"Yeah, I've seen Death Punch."
00:35:41.097,00:35:42.348,And what do you think?
00:35:43.516,00:35:45.518,It's pretty good. Not bad.
00:35:47.478,00:35:49.522,"Not a lot of fighting in it, you know, but..."
00:35:49.605,00:35:50.982,"Yeah, it's good."
00:35:51.065,00:35:53.609,It's a kung fu movie. It's not about fighting.
00:35:54.569,00:35:58.156,It's learning about what's inside yourself.
00:35:58.239,00:35:59.657,That's what Death Punch is.
00:35:59.740,00:36:02.118,"-You didn't see that? -I... Well, you know..."
00:36:02.201,00:36:04.871,"I saw it on YouTube. Maybe I missed some parts. So, you know..."
00:36:06.414,00:36:08.291,The sign-up list is still open.
00:36:11.210,00:36:13.296,"-It's ridiculous. -All right, well..."
00:36:16.716,00:36:18.426,How can you find it on DVD?
00:36:18.509,00:36:20.928,You can find it on DVD. You can find it on a VHS.
00:36:21.429,00:36:23.222,I recommend watching it on VHS.
00:36:23.306,00:36:24.557,-VHS? Really? -Yes.
00:36:24.640,00:36:27.894,"-Because that's how it's meant to be seen. -Hi, everybody. My name's Michael."
00:36:27.977,00:36:28.853,Um...
00:36:29.478,00:36:31.397,The... I want to...
00:36:32.231,00:36:33.941,"do some, um..."
00:36:36.360,00:36:38.571,I want to honor a movie called Death Punch.
00:36:38.654,00:36:40.323,It's my favorite movie in the world.
00:36:40.406,00:36:42.033,Nobody watches it.
00:36:42.116,00:36:44.744,"We're always trying to get people to watch it, and they don't."
00:36:44.827,00:36:48.581,"Um, it's hard to find, but it's very important to me."
00:36:49.290,00:36:51.083,"Uh, so..."
00:36:52.418,00:36:54.420,Yeah. Death Punch.
00:36:59.759,00:37:05.431,"The movie begins on Chien, a young kung fu student..."
00:37:06.182,00:37:10.269,"in the mountains. His moves are graceful and powerful, but something's missing."
00:37:10.353,00:37:11.979,He's not yet complete.
00:37:12.772,00:37:15.775,He's attacked by the Master Liu.
00:37:15.858,00:37:18.736,And a great battle ensues and...
00:37:18.819,00:37:23.157,And Liu winds up for what will become known as the Death Punch.
00:37:27.870,00:37:28.871,And...
00:37:30.289,00:37:31.207,He strikes.
00:37:32.124,00:37:34.293,But what happens is...
00:37:35.002,00:37:36.337,he actually misses...
00:37:36.796,00:37:39.465,Chien and he hits the barrel because...
00:37:41.259,00:37:43.928,"Sorry, I told it wrong. I shouldn't have..."
00:37:45.346,00:37:53.896,"They're the master-and-student relationship, but you think they're enemies and that's why it's funny when he hits the barrel because you think that it's, um..."
00:37:53.980,00:37:56.315,"I kind of messed that up, sorry. But back to the story."
00:37:56.399,00:38:04.699,"The water starts to jiggle, and Chien sees it and he says, That's the fear of... Um..."
00:38:07.159,00:38:10.538,"But, anyhow, this is kind of where you have to see the movie."
00:38:10.621,00:38:11.706,Sorry. Um...
00:38:11.789,00:38:14.792,"Anyway, it's a cool shot because the barrel starts to shake, right?"
00:38:14.875,00:38:17.169,It's rumbling. It's going crazy and...
00:38:17.962,00:38:18.796,it's...
00:38:32.393,00:38:35.313,"And suddenly, the barrel explodes with water."
00:38:38.190,00:38:39.608,Oh! He's soaked.
00:38:40.359,00:38:43.654,"If I had landed that punch, your fate would have been sealed."
00:38:43.738,00:38:47.116,"Three steps in any direction, and your heart would explode."
00:38:48.159,00:38:49.493,And then you'd be dead.
00:38:49.577,00:38:54.540,"Chien, he's stubborn and he learns the Death Punch anyway, by himself."
00:38:54.623,00:38:57.877,Alone he learns it. On the hill without a shirt on.
00:39:01.881,00:39:05.343,Ku Woo Tai shows up with 15 ninjas.
00:39:05.426,00:39:07.178,-Exactly 15. -Exactly 15 ninjas.
00:39:07.261,00:39:08.679,"Yes, and put him in a chokehold."
00:39:09.221,00:39:10.222,Ready?
00:39:12.099,00:39:13.684,"Then he goes, no."
00:39:16.354,00:39:18.064,"Oh, it burns."
00:39:20.191,00:39:22.610,-What have I done? -Do you see what happens?
00:39:32.036,00:39:33.621,I think we're this way.
00:39:33.704,00:39:34.747,Over here.
00:39:37.291,00:39:38.209,What time is it?
00:39:40.002,00:39:42.338,Eleven. Almost eleven.
00:39:46.008,00:39:48.344,"-It's closed. -Yeah, it's closed."
00:39:50.221,00:39:51.389,Closes at ten.
00:39:53.891,00:39:54.767,What?
00:39:56.143,00:39:57.061,Yeah?
00:39:58.187,00:39:59.063,Yeah?
00:40:00.564,00:40:01.607,I'll fucking do it.
00:40:03.776,00:40:05.569,-That's hot. -I love it.
00:40:06.362,00:40:07.405,I love it.
00:40:13.119,00:40:15.955,"Smells though, right? Does it smell a little? Like meat."
00:40:16.455,00:40:17.706,What do you mean you smell meat?
00:40:18.457,00:40:19.417,You don't get that?
00:40:20.209,00:40:22.628,-We're in a pot like soup. -I don't smell it.
00:40:24.171,00:40:25.464,Let's get some people in here.
00:40:26.090,00:40:31.262,"I'm gonna go to the bar. I'm gonna get the open-mic girl, and I'm gonna get David."
00:40:31.345,00:40:33.055,"-Oh, no. -Go get your friend David."
00:40:34.849,00:40:37.226,"I almost killed that guy, and he said, uh..."
00:40:37.309,00:40:39.228,"I'm sorry, I was just trying to..."
00:40:39.311,00:40:41.772,"-Oh, it's not your fault. -No, I was, you know..."
00:40:43.274,00:40:44.442,What?
00:40:45.818,00:40:47.695,"Oh, shit. The lady's here."
00:40:47.778,00:40:50.030,"Duck. Duck, duck, duck. Get under water."
00:40:50.114,00:40:51.073,"Hey, guys."
00:40:51.740,00:40:53.492,-Hi. -The pool's closed.
00:40:53.576,00:40:54.743,-Closed at nine. -All right.
00:40:54.827,00:40:56.829,"Sorry, we're gonna get out."
00:40:56.912,00:40:58.330,"-Yeah, are you drinking? -Okay."
00:40:58.414,00:41:00.166,-Don't come over. -That's against the rules.
00:41:00.249,00:41:02.293,"No, we're... You don't want to see..."
00:41:02.376,00:41:04.462,-I'm getting in. -No.
00:41:04.545,00:41:05.588,-No. -What?
00:41:22.188,00:41:29.945,"I mean, like from the very first moment, when you checked in, we could really feel that you were totally in love."
00:41:30.738,00:41:32.031,It's really sweet.
00:41:32.948,00:41:33.991,"Oh, no."
00:41:34.575,00:41:35.743,It's beautiful.
00:41:37.036,00:41:38.370,-We're just... -We're not...
00:41:38.454,00:41:39.914,"We're friends, right?"
00:41:39.997,00:41:41.665,We're not that way. We're...
00:41:42.374,00:41:44.668,-We love those guys. -Everybody's beautiful.
00:41:47.713,00:41:50.883,But everything's okay -with the rest of the world. -And it's great.
00:41:50.966,00:41:53.552,It was such a strong thing that we just assumed.
00:41:54.303,00:41:55.346,-I'm sorry. -Who is that?
00:41:55.429,00:41:56.764,We? Who's we?
00:41:56.847,00:41:58.390,"Oh, me and my husband."
00:41:59.600,00:42:04.104,"Oh, so we... Okay, we're not wearing clothes, so we're..."
00:42:04.188,00:42:06.941,He got naked so I got naked. That's the only reason I got naked.
00:42:07.024,00:42:09.193,-Where is he? -He's right here.
00:42:10.027,00:42:12.238,-What do you mean? -What do you mean he's right here?
00:42:12.321,00:42:14.323,-He's all around here. -Wait a minute.
00:42:14.406,00:42:16.075,"He's not like invisible, right?"
00:42:16.617,00:42:18.035,-No. -Don't say that.
00:42:18.118,00:42:20.704,He passed away a few years ago.
00:42:21.747,00:42:22.706,Oh.
00:42:22.790,00:42:27.461,"Yeah. We ran this place together for a long time, and he's here."
00:42:28.254,00:42:30.089,"So, I'm here with him."
00:42:37.179,00:42:38.639,I'm so sorry.
00:42:38.722,00:42:40.724,"I just blurted out, like..."
00:42:43.644,00:42:47.273,"Sorry, I'm just bad at small talk. I've never been good at it."
00:42:49.149,00:42:51.860,-I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. -I hate it.
00:42:52.778,00:42:54.446,I hate small talk.
00:42:54.905,00:42:57.992,"I work in an office, and that's all they do."
00:43:00.786,00:43:05.416,I keep trying to think of some kind of better opening conversation line.
00:43:05.499,00:43:08.002,I've been worrying about how to really do it. Something like...
00:43:08.085,00:43:12.006,"You want to talk? If you don't, it's okay."
00:43:13.549,00:43:15.342,"Well, yeah. Or like..."
00:43:17.344,00:43:18.470,I see you.
00:43:19.430,00:43:21.056,And now I'm gonna go over here.
00:43:21.557,00:43:22.433,Right?
00:43:26.228,00:43:28.397,"All right, I'm gonna hit the hay, guys."
00:43:30.232,00:43:32.151,-We just got started... -I gotta get some rest.
00:43:32.234,00:43:34.153,"Okay, well, we have to go."
00:43:34.236,00:43:37.323,"-You don't have to come. You can stay. -No, I'm gonna go."
00:43:37.406,00:43:39.700,"-I'm gonna go, too. -I'm just gonna go sleep in the room."
00:43:43.912,00:43:44.830,You stay.
00:43:46.332,00:43:48.292,"-Yeah, I'm gonna go. -No, Mike."
00:43:49.043,00:43:50.794,"Oh! Oh, Jesus."
00:43:52.379,00:43:53.672,Oh.
00:43:55.758,00:43:58.344,"I don't have a key, though. I don't have a key."
00:43:58.427,00:44:00.220,It's okay. I got a lot of keys.
00:44:00.804,00:44:02.598,You got a lot of them in the...
00:44:02.681,00:44:03.515,"Yeah, but..."
00:44:04.683,00:44:05.684,All right.
00:44:09.021,00:44:11.023,Mm-hmm.
00:44:15.611,00:44:16.570,That's cute.
00:44:20.282,00:44:23.494,-I was wrong. -I'm sorry for that.
00:44:30.668,00:44:31.585,Okay.
00:44:40.094,00:44:41.261,What about him?
00:44:46.558,00:44:48.894,"Yeah, well, he's always with me."
00:44:50.020,00:44:50.854,But...
00:44:51.397,00:44:52.690,he's also gone.
00:45:18.507,00:45:21.093,"-No. -No, it's okay. It's all right."
00:46:31.872,00:46:32.790,"Hey, Michael."
00:46:34.708,00:46:35.626,Michael.
00:46:41.423,00:46:42.382,"Hey, Michael."
00:46:43.217,00:46:44.635,"Michael. Hey, Michael."
00:46:52.851,00:46:53.727,"Hey, Michael."
00:46:58.982,00:47:00.984,-Why'd you wake me up? -Why are you screaming?
00:47:03.695,00:47:04.696,I scared you?
00:47:05.197,00:47:06.490,You looked like you were dead.
00:47:07.616,00:47:08.659,You thought...
00:47:10.494,00:47:11.662,I couldn't see you breathing.
00:47:17.459,00:47:18.460,-How'd it go? -What?
00:47:22.714,00:47:23.632,Hmm.
00:47:27.302,00:47:28.470,"Ah, come on."
00:47:35.435,00:47:36.395,What?
00:47:37.104,00:47:38.272,Nothing?
00:47:38.856,00:47:40.399,Good night. Uh-oh.
00:47:40.482,00:47:42.192,Good night. Uh-oh.
00:47:42.943,00:47:44.278,Good night.
00:47:52.661,00:47:54.913,My head. I got... I was a little drunk.
00:47:56.290,00:47:57.207,Hey.
00:48:22.441,00:48:23.442,Michael!
00:48:51.053,00:48:52.095,Michael!
00:49:20.666,00:49:22.209,What are you... You're over here?
00:49:23.418,00:49:25.963,Yeah. I was looking at the fire. I was waiting for you to get up.
00:49:26.046,00:49:28.966,"-I thought we'd get some pancakes. -Oh, you're watching the fire?"
00:49:29.049,00:49:30.842,"Yeah, you ever just watch a fire?"
00:49:30.926,00:49:33.220,-So nice. -Yeah. You should've woke me though.
00:49:33.303,00:49:34.179,What?
00:49:34.888,00:49:36.974,-You okay? What's wrong with you? -All right. Whatever.
00:49:37.057,00:49:38.725,"I'm all right. I'm hungry, that's all."
00:49:40.185,00:49:41.269,What do you want to do?
00:49:43.021,00:49:44.272,Why are you sweating?
00:49:44.773,00:49:47.192,I went outside. I thought you were down there.
00:49:47.693,00:49:49.695,I went down the block. I saw...
00:49:51.655,00:49:53.281,"I saw a bunch of people, you know?"
00:49:54.324,00:49:55.659,Want to do the pancakes?
00:49:57.244,00:49:58.078,Yeah.
00:49:59.162,00:50:01.665,-All right. Let me go to the room. -I want pancakes. All right.
00:50:04.459,00:50:06.712,"Andy, what are you doing?"
00:50:07.671,00:50:09.506,"What do you mean, What're you doing?"
00:50:09.589,00:50:10.757,I just got to...
00:50:12.467,00:50:13.719,wash up or something.
00:50:19.266,00:50:20.892,"You know, you keep..."
00:50:21.935,00:50:22.853,What?
00:50:23.478,00:50:25.230,-What about it? -You keep taking it.
00:50:25.939,00:50:26.815,Well...
00:50:27.441,00:50:30.819,"first of all, I'm taking it back."
00:50:31.528,00:50:33.280,-You took it this morning. -That's mine.
00:50:33.363,00:50:34.573,"No, it isn't yours."
00:50:34.656,00:50:35.866,Because I bought it.
00:50:35.949,00:50:37.325,All right? I bought it.
00:50:37.409,00:50:40.245,"You bought the safe, but the medication is mine."
00:50:40.328,00:50:42.789,"-No, I bought the medication, too. -That's the important part."
00:50:42.873,00:50:44.499,-Right? -You did not buy the medication.
00:50:44.583,00:50:46.043,-I didn't say... -You tried to buy it.
00:50:46.126,00:50:48.128,-I swiped the card. -I didn't say I'm paying for it?
00:50:48.211,00:50:50.005,-You said you were. -We have a witness.
00:50:50.088,00:50:51.548,You said it. But I'm the one whose...
00:50:51.631,00:50:53.467,"-Whose bank account got charged? -Oh, so I lied?"
00:50:53.550,00:50:55.427,I'm paying for it. It's mine.
00:50:56.011,00:50:57.471,-It's mine. -Just give it to me.
00:50:57.554,00:50:59.806,-We don't have-- -What are you doing?
00:51:00.223,00:51:01.933,"I'm gonna hold it, that's all."
00:51:02.017,00:51:03.727,You're running away from me? Give me the...
00:51:03.810,00:51:05.479,"What, are you chasing me? You're chasing me."
00:51:05.562,00:51:07.022,I'm not chasing you. You're walking.
00:51:07.105,00:51:09.775,Stop moving around the table. Stop moving.
00:51:09.858,00:51:10.984,"Just stop it, all right?"
00:51:11.068,00:51:13.820,-I'm not-- -Stop it. This is stupid.
00:51:13.904,00:51:16.323,I got the bad knee. You know I got the bad knee.
00:51:16.406,00:51:18.241,You know I'm gonna catch you if you want me to.
00:51:19.910,00:51:22.287,"-Andy! Andy! -I'll tell you right now, I won't stop."
00:51:29.002,00:51:30.045,That's mine.
00:51:33.131,00:51:34.508,-I want it. -Okay.
00:51:36.176,00:51:38.345,"Um, maybe it is yours."
00:51:38.845,00:51:40.097,I need to hold it.
00:51:40.889,00:51:41.890,All right?
00:51:42.933,00:51:45.227,I don't know why you're making a big deal out of it.
00:51:48.730,00:51:50.273,Because I'm the dying guy.
00:51:56.530,00:51:58.615,-I'm the dying guy. -Okay. All right.
00:51:59.366,00:52:00.492,You can't keep saying that.
00:52:01.076,00:52:02.536,But you keep taking that.
00:52:02.619,00:52:04.913,-I'm the dying guy. -All right. Shut up with that.
00:52:04.996,00:52:06.081,Then give me the safe.
00:52:06.164,00:52:09.501,-You're being a stupid idiot. -I'm being stupid? I'm the dying guy.
00:52:09.584,00:52:11.128,-Shut up! -I'm the dying guy.
00:52:11.211,00:52:13.338,-I know you're the dying guy. Stop. -I'm the dying guy!
00:52:13.421,00:52:15.215,I'm the other guy!
00:54:52.205,00:54:53.707,There's 32 dogs.
00:54:54.874,00:54:56.126,Twenty ate cats.
00:54:58.420,00:54:59.546,How many didn't?
00:55:21.901,00:55:24.404,Thirty-two dogs. Twenty of them ate cats.
00:55:25.864,00:55:26.865,It's 12.
00:55:32.370,00:55:33.580,I'm so smart.
00:55:36.541,00:55:37.876,That's not the code.
00:55:37.959,00:55:39.085,Yeah.
00:55:39.627,00:55:42.839,"-The code is one, two, three, four? -See? You're not that smart."
00:55:43.423,00:55:44.424,Should've got it.
00:55:53.600,00:55:55.143,I can't be normal...
00:55:56.186,00:55:58.396,through all of this. I just can't.
00:56:11.201,00:56:12.077,Okay.
00:56:20.085,00:56:21.002,All right.
00:56:25.882,00:56:29.344,"I think I might have burnt it a little on the bottom, but I think it's okay."
00:56:34.224,00:56:35.392,They're still fighting here?
00:56:35.475,00:56:37.394,There's more fighting in this than I remember.
00:56:41.189,00:56:42.774,Your friend Dave would love it.
00:56:50.698,00:56:51.741,It's gonna get cold.
00:56:52.867,00:56:54.160,I'll get it in a sec.
00:56:55.870,00:56:57.038,I can re-heat it.
00:57:02.168,00:57:06.172,"Chien, when you woke this morning, did you think it would be for the last time?"
00:57:12.470,00:57:13.388,Still got it.
00:57:13.471,00:57:14.722,Mm-hmm.
00:57:24.149,00:57:26.317,-Ah! -Happy birthday to you.
00:57:26.401,00:57:28.403,Happy birthday to Andy.
00:57:28.486,00:57:29.821,The cupcake...
00:57:29.904,00:57:32.073,that I bought. Thank you.
00:57:34.409,00:57:35.368,Make a wish.
00:57:38.538,00:57:40.373,You still got cancer that's killing you?
00:57:41.541,00:57:43.126,-I think so. -Yeah.
00:57:43.751,00:57:44.878,See? It never works.
00:57:51.384,00:57:52.552,You gonna have some?
00:57:53.428,00:57:54.512,I don't think so.
00:57:55.263,00:57:56.514,Doesn't smell like orange.
00:58:17.577,00:58:19.370,-You all right? -Yeah.
00:58:22.248,00:58:23.750,Feels like there's a little more.
00:58:24.375,00:58:25.793,"-Really? -It's like, just..."
00:58:26.544,00:58:27.545,I don't know.
00:58:28.379,00:58:30.089,"It doesn't all come, you know?"
00:58:32.550,00:58:34.552,"-It feels better, though. -Yeah."
00:58:38.306,00:58:39.224,"No, it's..."
00:58:39.307,00:58:41.601,"It sounded like you got all of it out, though."
00:59:02.372,00:59:03.831,It is River Kickers.
00:59:06.584,00:59:07.669,They're scamming.
00:59:12.382,00:59:13.633,You were right.
00:59:13.716,00:59:16.594,The one from the gas station is River Kickers.
00:59:18.179,00:59:19.097,Michael.
00:59:22.976,00:59:24.978,"-Hey, Michael. -Hmm? What?"
00:59:28.273,00:59:29.524,It's River Kickers.
00:59:48.668,00:59:49.586,Master.
00:59:50.420,00:59:52.213,Which way to the ancient healer?
01:00:07.520,01:00:08.771,I think I'm ready.
01:00:13.026,01:00:15.612,I want to go when I feel good. I don't want to go when it's hurting.
01:00:15.695,01:00:16.779,But you're feeling good.
01:00:16.863,01:00:20.617,"Yeah, but it's not gonna stay that way. You know, I'd like to do it when I feel..."
01:00:22.285,01:00:23.870,I think I'm ready.
01:00:42.680,01:00:45.600,"I should have took off from work. You know, I should have took off."
01:00:45.683,01:00:47.644,A month ago. We could've done more stuff.
01:00:48.895,01:00:50.063,We could've done more stuff.
01:00:52.649,01:00:53.775,I wish I had done that.
01:01:01.324,01:01:02.909,Did you hear my speech?
01:01:02.992,01:01:04.952,My half-time speech. Huh?
01:01:08.665,01:01:09.666,"Let me guess, it's..."
01:01:12.960,01:01:14.545,-Guys... -You're never gonna guess it.
01:01:14.629,01:01:15.672,"Guys, you..."
01:01:16.172,01:01:17.548,"We're gonna lose, but..."
01:01:18.216,01:01:24.097,"You know, go back... Go forward in your life and imagine where you are and if you had a chance-- How do you know that?"
01:01:26.808,01:01:28.685,You're my best friend. I know you.
01:01:37.944,01:01:41.280,"Also, I heard you practicing it through the vent about 100 times."
01:01:50.206,01:01:52.834,"You seem really good right now. You know, you seem like..."
01:01:55.253,01:01:56.754,Maybe there's... I don't know.
01:01:59.215,01:02:00.466,I know.
01:02:01.259,01:02:02.802,-I'm ready. -I know.
01:02:13.938,01:02:15.940,"-So, 100 of these suckers. -Yeah."
01:02:18.067,01:02:20.945,I don't even know if you had to buy this particular pill.
01:02:21.028,01:02:23.281,"A hundred of anything, really, would..."
01:02:23.865,01:02:24.824,would...
01:02:25.324,01:02:26.409,You know?
01:02:31.372,01:02:32.582,I wonder if they do that...
01:02:33.082,01:02:34.208,"on purpose, you know?"
01:02:38.171,01:02:39.714,You think anybody's ever died...
01:02:44.719,01:02:47.013,"-You're spilling it on the side now. -Oh, sorry."
01:02:47.096,01:02:48.723,"Well, you spilled it now."
01:02:48.806,01:02:51.809,"Well, sorry. We got to go back now, right?"
01:03:03.654,01:03:05.031,I was married once.
01:03:07.617,01:03:08.910,-Are you kidding me? -Uh-uh.
01:03:09.869,01:03:12.371,-You never told me that? -I never told anybody that.
01:03:12.455,01:03:13.498,Why didn't you tell me?
01:03:16.042,01:03:17.001,How long?
01:03:18.419,01:03:20.713,-Year and a half. -Yeah?
01:03:22.298,01:03:24.300,I used to feel so bad about it.
01:03:26.511,01:03:27.470,I really...
01:03:28.721,01:03:30.181,I thought I wanted that...
01:03:31.224,01:03:32.767,that life. I really...
01:03:34.977,01:03:36.103,And I was...
01:03:39.607,01:03:42.151,I left her. It was awful.
01:03:44.654,01:03:46.113,And then I thought...
01:03:47.198,01:03:48.908,"Oh, I know I need to be alone."
01:03:48.991,01:03:51.911,I'm convinced. That's what I need to do. I need to be alone.
01:03:51.994,01:03:53.538,I thought that for sure.
01:03:56.916,01:03:58.417,And then I ended up here...
01:04:00.837,01:04:01.879,with you.
01:04:05.049,01:04:06.092,And I knew.
01:04:08.177,01:04:09.554,"Like, This is my spot."
01:04:12.181,01:04:13.432,This is where I belong.
01:04:15.434,01:04:16.394,Hmm.
01:04:21.440,01:04:22.942,When you first came...
01:04:24.527,01:04:29.282,and you were looking at this apartment -when Barry was showing it to you... -Yeah.
01:04:29.866,01:04:30.783,...I saw you.
01:04:32.451,01:04:34.161,"Yeah, I didn't want you to get it."
01:04:35.705,01:04:37.123,"I know, you looked..."
01:04:38.207,01:04:39.250,You look weird.
01:04:40.543,01:04:43.963,"Yeah, I mean, I didn't know you were gonna be a cool guy and everything."
01:04:45.673,01:04:47.550,I told Barry you look like one of those guys...
01:04:49.260,01:04:51.512,"you know, you see on the news. He's got a..."
01:04:52.138,01:04:54.640,He's got a freezer full of hands and feet.
01:04:56.100,01:04:58.769,"I told Barry, I said, Eh, why don't you keep looking?"
01:05:04.650,01:05:05.693,It's all right.
01:05:05.776,01:05:07.904,I've seen people look at me like that in...
01:05:07.987,01:05:09.071,a Rite Aid or something.
01:05:09.155,01:05:11.866,-People look at me like that all the time. -Yeah.
01:05:14.118,01:05:16.579,"Oh, God. We gotta deal with this."
01:05:17.955,01:05:18.915,Oh.
01:05:21.834,01:05:23.461,"I mean, it's now or never, so..."
01:05:24.003,01:05:25.671,I'll just tell you if you want.
01:05:27.673,01:05:29.675,I don't think you're gonna like it though.
01:05:30.301,01:05:31.802,-You never know. -I hope you do.
01:05:31.886,01:05:33.679,"-It's fatty pork. -No, it's not fatty pork."
01:05:33.763,01:05:35.514,-It's fatty pork. -It's not fatty pork.
01:05:35.598,01:05:36.766,What is it?
01:05:36.849,01:05:37.892,It's nothing.
01:05:37.975,01:05:39.518,Wait.
01:05:39.602,01:05:41.437,"Yeah, I did that."
01:05:41.520,01:05:43.147,There's no answer?
01:05:43.230,01:05:45.775,"No, there's no answer, -but I have a reason. -Two years?"
01:05:45.858,01:05:48.527,-Why would you do that to me? -Because when we do puzzles...
01:05:49.403,01:05:51.989,it's a lot of work and...
01:05:52.073,01:05:53.574,"it's hard, but it's fun."
01:05:53.658,01:05:56.160,And there's a finish. There's something real you can finish.
01:05:56.243,01:05:58.663,"I know, but you always look sad when we'd finish."
01:05:58.746,01:06:00.873,"-I don't look sad. No, I don't. -You always look a little sad."
01:06:00.957,01:06:02.708,You don't see it. I see it.
01:06:03.918,01:06:06.003,"We're happy, we're done, we got it."
01:06:08.047,01:06:11.092,"And then you get a little sad. I thought, You know what?"
01:06:11.801,01:06:12.885,He'll never get it.
01:06:14.095,01:06:15.554,He'll never get this shirt.
01:06:16.305,01:06:18.140,This will be his favorite shirt.
01:06:27.525,01:06:29.527,-Got any other confessions? -No.
01:06:30.277,01:06:32.488,I thought you were a killer. I...
01:06:33.030,01:06:34.699,gave you a shirt with no answer.
01:06:36.492,01:06:38.160,That's it. I'm clean now.
01:06:38.244,01:06:39.954,"Come on, that's the last one. We got to..."
01:06:50.715,01:06:52.133,What's the next step?
01:06:57.847,01:07:00.433,Fill the glass with four ounces of water.
01:07:02.852,01:07:04.520,That's the lethal dose.
01:07:04.603,01:07:05.730,And you dilute it.
01:07:06.981,01:07:09.567,"It's bitter, so you're gonna drink it all at once."
01:07:14.113,01:07:15.156,Okay.
01:07:19.660,01:07:22.872,"in a few minutes, -you fall asleep. -Yeah."
01:07:23.748,01:07:26.917,-And then a few minutes later... -I remember that part.
01:07:27.001,01:07:28.127,"Then there's, um..."
01:07:30.421,01:07:33.466,The yellow one is for anti-vomiting.
01:07:34.175,01:07:38.179,That's the thing. If you vomit this up then it's all for nothing.
01:07:38.971,01:07:40.681,This is for anti-anxiety.
01:07:40.765,01:07:42.016,If you take it and then...
01:07:42.099,01:07:44.268,I don't want that. I want to be in my head.
01:07:44.810,01:07:47.313,"-All right, I'll keep this. -I don't need that but I'll take this."
01:07:48.981,01:07:49.899,All right.
01:07:51.275,01:07:54.070,Takes an hour. After you take that pill...
01:07:54.153,01:07:55.529,I got to wait an hour after?
01:07:55.613,01:07:58.032,"You got to wait an hour for that to take effect, yeah."
01:07:58.657,01:08:00.076,"All right, we should have taken..."
01:08:02.536,01:08:04.288,-Go ahead. -Tell me when you swallow it.
01:08:06.290,01:08:07.249,Okay.
01:08:08.375,01:08:10.377,"Now, so we just wait an hour?"
01:08:10.920,01:08:12.338,Hmm. You got to wait an hour.
01:08:15.257,01:08:17.259,"Yeah, you should feel free to sell the car."
01:08:19.011,01:08:20.012,"Yeah, maybe."
01:08:20.846,01:08:22.848,"I don't think you should be driving, anyway."
01:08:24.308,01:08:26.769,I do think you should keep my phone though.
01:08:26.852,01:08:27.853,Nah.
01:08:28.646,01:08:30.648,"-Nah, I don't want it. -What do you mean, nah?"
01:08:30.731,01:08:32.733,Don't you think it's time you get a phone?
01:08:34.652,01:08:36.112,"Yeah, I'll get one."
01:08:36.529,01:08:38.114,I don't want yours.
01:08:39.949,01:08:42.243,You don't get e-mail right? You can't get e-mail on it.
01:08:49.083,01:08:51.502,"-You don't know what you're doing. -It comes with instructions, right?"
01:08:52.586,01:08:54.296,"-Yeah, don't do that. -What?"
01:08:54.922,01:08:56.924,-What are you doing? -I'm smelling a tree.
01:08:57.007,01:08:59.260,-I haven't smelled it before. -There's bugs.
01:08:59.343,01:09:01.345,What's it gonna do to me now?
01:09:02.304,01:09:05.141,I don't know. There's a lot of larvae and stuff on there.
01:09:09.019,01:09:11.605,There's something I do want to talk to you about that...
01:09:13.524,01:09:14.900,I don't think you're gonna like...
01:09:17.820,01:09:18.737,What?
01:09:22.741,01:09:24.243,I don't believe...
01:09:27.037,01:09:29.039,but if there's an after...
01:09:31.167,01:09:32.543,situation...
01:09:35.754,01:09:40.342,and I could somehow contact you...
01:09:41.468,01:09:46.724,"You know, like the woman in the hotel. She hangs out with her husband, you know."
01:09:46.807,01:09:50.227,"She's saying what she feels. You don't mean real. I mean, that's..."
01:09:51.687,01:09:55.316,"-That's just in movies and stuff, right? -But on the..."
01:09:55.399,01:09:59.320,.001 chance...
01:10:00.529,01:10:02.239,would you want me to...
01:10:04.783,01:10:05.910,contact you?
01:10:10.664,01:10:11.832,This is...
01:10:11.916,01:10:13.667,This is a tough one for me.
01:10:13.751,01:10:15.502,-I don't know. -I could send you a signal.
01:10:16.462,01:10:17.755,-Yeah. -You know?
01:10:19.548,01:10:21.550,Push the water glass a little bit or...
01:10:22.384,01:10:26.805,"-leave you a note in the foggy mirror... -No. No, don't do that."
01:10:26.889,01:10:28.390,"No, no. Do not do that."
01:10:29.934,01:10:32.311,"Nothing sudden or, you know..."
01:10:33.520,01:10:34.688,Nothing at midnight.
01:10:34.772,01:10:35.648,Yeah.
01:10:36.482,01:10:39.068,"No moaning through the vent. No, woo."
01:10:40.152,01:10:41.403,Although now...
01:10:43.155,01:10:44.073,What?
01:10:44.156,01:10:47.368,"You know, you did now. Now I'm just gonna think anything weird..."
01:10:48.827,01:10:51.747,"I'm gonna think it's you. The wind, it's you."
01:10:51.830,01:10:54.041,"The light flickers, it's you."
01:10:54.625,01:10:58.337,"Let's just pick something right now, so I know everything else..."
01:10:58.420,01:11:01.298,That's what I was getting at in the first...
01:11:39.795,01:11:41.297,Oh...
01:11:46.385,01:11:47.344,I'm winded.
01:12:04.236,01:12:05.654,I just realized something.
01:12:08.324,01:12:09.700,I never talked about...
01:12:10.326,01:12:11.577,where.
01:12:12.286,01:12:13.787,"Yeah, no. We didn't."
01:12:15.539,01:12:16.874,I guess you could just...
01:12:17.458,01:12:19.376,-There's no instructions. -No.
01:12:23.964,01:12:27.468,"I guess we could do it on the couch. I mean, I'm here."
01:12:28.510,01:12:29.553,Yeah.
01:12:29.636,01:12:31.305,"I mean, that makes sense, right?"
01:12:32.264,01:12:33.223,"It's, uh..."
01:12:34.350,01:12:36.143,"-It's our spot. -It's our place, right? Yeah."
01:12:39.980,01:12:41.357,I don't want to do it on the couch.
01:12:41.482,01:12:43.192,All right. Okay.
01:12:47.988,01:12:50.240,"If I was on the floor, I'd be closer to the door."
01:12:50.324,01:12:52.576,-For when... -If that's what you want.
01:12:54.328,01:12:55.454,"I took, you know..."
01:12:59.625,01:13:01.251,I don't want to do it on the floor.
01:13:01.752,01:13:02.920,All right.
01:13:03.003,01:13:03.879,Okay.
01:13:05.506,01:13:07.007,Uh...
01:13:09.760,01:13:10.969,Um...
01:13:13.889,01:13:15.933,-Hmm? You all right? -Yeah.
01:13:17.518,01:13:18.977,You all right? You want me to...
01:13:27.778,01:13:29.405,I want to do it in here.
01:13:29.488,01:13:30.781,-On the bed. -Okay.
01:13:31.281,01:13:32.866,-All right. -Can you get the drink?
01:13:34.159,01:13:35.577,"Yeah, okay."
01:15:23.143,01:15:24.102,If you feel...
01:15:28.106,01:15:29.399,It's okay.
01:16:07.104,01:16:08.105,Wanna lay down?
01:16:08.689,01:16:09.565,Yeah.
01:16:09.648,01:16:11.149,-Should I lay down? -You wanna lay down?
01:16:11.233,01:16:13.235,Okay. Yeah.
01:16:17.114,01:16:19.324,Okay. All right. Okay.
01:16:20.200,01:16:21.243,Okay.
01:16:29.543,01:16:30.627,What?
01:16:30.711,01:16:34.006,I'm starting to... I'm shaking a little bit.
01:16:34.089,01:16:35.716,"It's okay. It's, uh..."
01:16:39.720,01:16:41.722,I'm getting a little scared.
01:16:41.805,01:16:44.808,"Yeah, you don't have to be scared. I think it's gonna be okay."
01:16:44.891,01:16:46.351,I think everything's gonna be okay.
01:16:51.231,01:16:53.358,I think it's gonna be okay.
01:16:55.235,01:16:56.153,I know.
01:16:57.571,01:16:58.780,It's gonna be all right.
01:17:00.407,01:17:02.075,"No, I do. I do."
01:17:03.076,01:17:05.954,"It's gonna be okay, Michael."
01:17:06.038,01:17:06.955,Okay.
01:17:07.873,01:17:09.082,"It's okay, man."
01:17:11.752,01:17:13.003,I'm okay.
01:17:16.089,01:17:16.923,Okay.
01:17:22.471,01:17:24.931,"Yeah, I know. 'Cause I know. I got a feeling."
01:17:25.015,01:17:27.142,"I got a feeling, man. I got a feeling about this."
01:17:27.225,01:17:28.393,Give me your hand.
01:17:28.477,01:17:31.021,"Oh, my God. I'm already-- Give me your hand. Hey."
01:17:32.689,01:17:34.232,I want to tell you I love you.
01:17:39.196,01:17:41.156,Okay.
01:17:43.408,01:17:44.284,Okay.
01:17:44.743,01:17:46.411,-It's okay. -Okay.
01:17:46.495,01:17:48.038,I feel good.
01:17:48.121,01:17:49.122,I feel okay.
01:17:49.206,01:17:50.540,You're gonna be okay.
01:17:50.624,01:17:51.750,-You know? -Okay.
01:17:51.833,01:17:52.959,"It's okay, Michael."
01:17:53.043,01:17:53.877,Hey...
01:17:54.544,01:17:56.380,"-Hey, Andy? -Yeah?"
01:17:57.255,01:18:00.050,"I'm gonna close my eyes now, okay?"
01:18:00.133,01:18:01.259,-Yeah? -Okay?
01:18:02.636,01:18:04.179,-Okay. -All right.
01:18:26.618,01:18:28.036,"I love you, too, Michael."
01:21:56.828,01:21:58.455,"See you down the road, friend."
01:22:29.861,01:22:31.071,You in C?
01:22:33.073,01:22:35.617,"Uh, yeah. We're moving into C."
01:22:40.997,01:22:42.540,I'm going over there so...
01:22:43.792,01:22:44.751,Thank you.
01:22:52.592,01:22:54.803,"-F? -Yeah, that's upstairs."
01:22:54.886,01:22:56.513,"-Oh, right above us. -Uh-huh."
01:22:57.597,01:22:58.473,Okay.
01:23:09.025,01:23:12.112,"You got the best apartment, actually."
01:23:12.529,01:23:14.739,Oh. You hear that? Best apartment.
01:23:17.450,01:23:19.452,"You're lucky, actually, that you got this one."
01:23:28.086,01:23:29.087,Is that you?
01:23:29.587,01:23:30.797,It's Evan?
01:23:30.880,01:23:32.757,You can answer him. Tell him.
01:23:34.259,01:23:35.468,It's all right.
01:23:35.552,01:23:37.554,He doesn't have to. I'm Andy.
01:23:38.972,01:23:40.390,"-Kiersten, hi. -Okay."
01:23:42.684,01:23:44.686,"So, I guess you like games then, Evan, huh?"
01:23:44.769,01:23:46.813,-Yeah. -You ever play Paddleton?
01:23:47.272,01:23:48.857,-Paddleton? -Yeah.
01:23:49.482,01:23:51.484,-No. -No. 'Cause we made it up.
01:23:52.027,01:23:53.737,-Yeah. -How do you play?
01:23:53.820,01:23:59.409,"Like, it's like paddle ball, but you gotta imagine this whole wall here, right?"
01:23:59.492,01:24:00.827,You hit a ball against it.
01:24:01.411,01:24:04.080,And you got to get it into a barrel that's over here.
01:24:04.164,01:24:05.707,We put a barrel right there.
01:24:05.790,01:24:08.668,"And, uh, it doesn't sound like a lot of fun, but it is."
01:24:09.419,01:24:11.838,It's good. It's fun. Yeah. I'll show you one day.
01:24:12.464,01:24:13.548,All right.
01:24:15.800,01:24:17.469,"-Nice to meet you. -Yeah, you too."
01:24:17.552,01:24:19.971,"I got a great football half-time speech, too."
01:24:20.055,01:24:21.431,-If you ever need it. -Okay.
01:24:22.015,01:24:23.266,Yeah. It's a good one.
