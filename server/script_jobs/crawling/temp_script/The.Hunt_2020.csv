00:02:18.304,00:02:19.848,Can I get you a snack?
00:02:19.931,00:02:21.307,"Uh, what?"
00:02:21.391,00:02:23.017,"I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to interrupt."
00:02:23.101,00:02:24.894,I just wanted to see if you'd like a snack.
00:02:28.064,00:02:29.983,-Oh. Okay. -Yeah.
00:02:30.066,00:02:31.901,-What's up? -We have some fantastic caviar.
00:02:31.985,00:02:34.362,"It's osetra, fresh from… You ever had caviar?"
00:02:34.988,00:02:35.864,"No, sir."
00:02:35.947,00:02:38.116,"It's delicious. It is, yeah."
00:02:38.199,00:02:39.450,But I had some last night.
00:02:40.034,00:02:43.371,You know what? I'm actually in the mood for something a little bit more Mediterranean.
00:02:43.454,00:02:50.712,"Do you have, like, a grilled vegetable thing with some figs or even, like, like, any kind of small fish?"
00:02:51.588,00:02:54.549,"I'm sorry, sir. We don't… we don't have a kitchen, full kitchen here."
00:02:57.427,00:02:58.845,How about a glass of champagne?
00:02:58.928,00:03:00.013,-Boom. -Great.
00:03:00.096,00:03:01.431,Perfect.
00:03:06.185,00:03:09.105,"-Hey, is that the Heidsieck? -I'm sorry?"
00:03:09.188,00:03:12.567,A German sub sank a ship on the way to Tsar Nicholas II.
00:03:12.650,00:03:17.405,"Couple years back, they found the wreck and a case of the 1907 Heidsieck."
00:03:17.488,00:03:19.908,They sent a little robot down there to bring it back up.
00:03:19.991,00:03:23.369,Athena bought three bottles at 250K per.
00:03:23.453,00:03:25.955,And no one even knows what the stuff tastes like.
00:03:26.581,00:03:28.207,It's just plain old champagne.
00:03:33.504,00:03:37.467,"-You like working for Athena? -Yes, she's… sweet."
00:03:37.550,00:03:39.802,She's sweet? Don't let her hear you say that.
00:03:44.390,00:03:46.017,-What is happening? -Oh!
00:03:47.310,00:03:50.230,What the… Oh! Fuck! Shit.
00:03:50.313,00:03:51.689,What's going on? What is happening?
00:03:51.773,00:03:53.399,"One of them's fucking awake, man."
00:03:55.944,00:03:57.528,Ted!
00:03:57.612,00:03:59.280,"Okay, calm down."
00:03:59.364,00:04:01.241,Everything's okay. Everything's fine.
00:04:01.324,00:04:02.408,"Hey, it's all right."
00:04:05.578,00:04:07.038,"-Okay, no, it's okay. -Jesus."
00:04:07.121,00:04:08.957,"Shh… It's all right. No, no, no, it's all right."
00:04:09.040,00:04:10.291,It's okay. I'm a doctor.
00:04:12.669,00:04:16.214,If you could just lay those towels -on the floor right there. -Fuck.
00:04:16.297,00:04:18.007,"Now, what's his… what's his… what's his name?"
00:04:18.091,00:04:23.554,"His na… Squealer, I think? I… -Randy? Oh, that's great. -Yeah."
00:04:23.638,00:04:26.724,"Now, I just need you… We're just gonna… We're just gonna go down to the floor."
00:04:26.808,00:04:29.519,"Just kneel down. There you go. There. Good, good."
00:04:29.602,00:04:32.355,"Now, I need you to lie back down on those towels."
00:04:32.438,00:04:34.357,There you go. There you go.
00:04:34.440,00:04:36.859,"Uh. Oh. Um, may I use your pen?"
00:04:36.943,00:04:39.195,-Pen. Yes. -Thanks.
00:04:39.279,00:04:41.239,"Okay, Randy."
00:04:41.322,00:04:43.074,I'm gonna put you back to sleep now.
00:04:43.157,00:04:46.160,-What? -Because you woke up before you were supposed to.
00:04:49.789,00:04:51.124,"Oh, fuck!"
00:04:53.918,00:04:55.712,"Hey, you're bleeding."
00:04:56.587,00:04:58.047,"Ted, what the fuck, man?"
00:04:58.131,00:04:59.716,He woke up.
00:04:59.799,00:05:02.677,"And we can't have you talking about this, now, can we, Randy?"
00:05:02.760,00:05:04.095,"It hasn't even started yet, man."
00:05:06.139,00:05:08.099,You guys just gonna stand there?
00:05:08.182,00:05:09.726,-Oh! -Oh!

00:05:26.617,00:05:28.077,"It's okay, now. All right, all right."
00:05:34.792,00:05:36.586,"This isn't right. I mean, he doesn't even know."
00:05:36.669,00:05:38.046,"I mean, it hasn't even started yet."
00:05:46.429,00:05:48.431,War is war.
00:05:52.143,00:05:55.605,Oh. Uh… Thanks.

00:12:53.105,00:12:55.107,"Yeah, fuck if I know. Here."
00:12:55.191,00:12:56.609,I can't use that.
00:12:56.692,00:12:58.360,Can you do this?
00:12:59.445,00:13:01.822,"-Yeah. -You can squeeze a trigger, then."
00:13:01.906,00:13:02.990,Take it.
00:13:07.369,00:13:08.746,"TEC-9, Lou."

00:13:22.259,00:13:24.386,-Thanks. -You're welcome.
00:13:26.680,00:13:28.432,-What was that? -I think that was a rifle.
00:13:29.892,00:13:31.769,"-Oh, shit. Come on. -Everybody get the fuck down!"
00:13:31.852,00:13:33.103,-Move! -Go! Go! Go!

00:14:35.624,00:14:38.335,-I fell. -It's okay. It's okay.
00:14:39.628,00:14:40.588,I fell.
00:14:41.171,00:14:43.007,It's my birthday tomorrow.
00:14:43.090,00:14:45.801,-What? -I'm gonna eat a whole pie.
00:14:45.885,00:14:46.719,"Oh, God."

00:15:26.258,00:15:27.968,"No, no, no, I'm not gonna shoot you."
00:15:28.052,00:15:30.971,"-No. No, wait. No, no, no! -Let go, you fucking snowflake!"
00:15:59.667,00:16:00.709,Okay.
00:16:02.336,00:16:03.671,Fuck.
00:16:13.681,00:16:15.140,"Don't shoot, asshole."
00:16:15.224,00:16:16.517,I'm on your side.
00:16:20.020,00:16:21.855,"They with us, too?"
00:16:21.939,00:16:23.273,Yeah.
00:16:23.357,00:16:26.110,-Road means civilization. -What?
00:16:26.193,00:16:27.528,Civilization's our fucking friend.
00:16:27.611,00:16:28.612,"Hey, folks."
00:16:28.696,00:16:30.239,"What's the plan, khaki man?"
00:16:30.322,00:16:32.157,-Trying to figure it out. -Sorry.
00:16:32.241,00:16:34.284,Looks like we're gonna have to climb this bitch.
00:16:34.368,00:16:35.911,"You know what this is, right?"
00:16:36.745,00:16:38.831,-Goddamn Manorgate. -That shit's real?
00:16:38.914,00:16:40.374,Seems pretty fucking real to me.
00:16:40.457,00:16:42.626,"-Yeah, right, come on. Up, up, up. -I'm going."
00:16:56.098,00:16:57.516,-What the fuck was that? -Hurry.
00:16:57.599,00:16:59.393,"Oh, shit, that's fucking arrows, dude."
00:16:59.476,00:17:00.644,Hurry up.
00:17:00.728,00:17:01.562,I got you. I got you.
00:17:01.645,00:17:03.439,-Jesus fucking Christ. -No… keep climbing.
00:17:05.274,00:17:06.233,No! Keep climbing.
00:17:06.316,00:17:09.028,"Keep climbing. Come on, no… Up, up. Go up."
00:17:09.111,00:17:10.988,What is this Avatar shit?
00:17:12.072,00:17:13.115,We should go.
00:17:13.198,00:17:15.868,-Fuck it. -Run!
00:17:56.950,00:17:58.911,That's another one of us getting blown the fuck up.
00:17:58.994,00:18:01.121,-Fuck. -We got to find shelter. Come on!
00:18:22.142,00:18:24.061,There's about $200 in the cash register.
00:18:24.144,00:18:25.479,It's all yours.
00:18:26.396,00:18:27.856,Give me a hand here. Come on.
00:18:30.109,00:18:31.485,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Stop."
00:18:34.780,00:18:36.240,"Look, son, we don't want no trouble."
00:18:36.323,00:18:38.325,-Just take the money. -I don't want your damn money.
00:18:38.408,00:18:40.077,Where the fuck are we?
00:18:40.160,00:18:42.496,"Well, Route 31, right outside of Elaine."
00:18:42.579,00:18:44.498,"Elaine, where?"
00:18:44.581,00:18:45.457,Which state?
00:18:45.541,00:18:46.750,Arkansas.
00:18:46.834,00:18:48.627,What?
00:18:48.710,00:18:50.087,We're in Arkansas?
00:18:50.170,00:18:53.048,"Wha… Man, Jesus."
00:18:53.132,00:18:54.591,Fucking Arkansas.
00:18:56.635,00:18:57.845,-You got a phone? -Please.
00:18:57.928,00:18:59.555,We have children. We have grandchildren.
00:18:59.638,00:19:01.849,"Oh, you have grandchildren? Can I see a picture of them?"
00:19:01.932,00:19:04.101,I'm just kidding. I don't give a fuck. Give me the phone.
00:19:04.184,00:19:07.646,"Son, whatever's going on here… What's going on is we're getting goddamn hunted."
00:19:09.606,00:19:12.067,"Yeah, to defend ourselves."
00:19:12.151,00:19:13.610,-Hello? -9-1-1. What's your emergency?
00:19:13.694,00:19:15.487,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's been a killing spree."
00:19:15.571,00:19:17.781,"-You gotta come here right now. -Can you repeat that, sir?"
00:19:17.865,00:19:20.826,"There's been a murder spree in the woods, a fucking massacre."
00:19:20.909,00:19:22.161,It's Manorgate!
00:19:22.244,00:19:24.454,"I'm sorry, sir. I'm having trouble understanding you."
00:19:24.538,00:19:25.914,Manorgate.
00:19:25.998,00:19:27.791,Just fucking Google it!
00:19:27.875,00:19:29.334,I can't Google it right now.
00:19:29.418,00:19:31.086,"-Listen to me, okay? -We can't do that."
00:19:31.170,00:19:36.175,"We woke up with these gags in our mouth, and they had these… these locks on 'em… Sir, I need the address of your emergency."
00:19:36.258,00:19:43.807,"Do you want my address in Staten Island, New York, where I went to a bar after work and I don't remember anything because they drugged me, they drugged all of us?"
00:19:43.891,00:19:44.933,Where'd they get you from?
00:19:45.017,00:19:46.351,Wyoming.
00:19:46.435,00:19:47.644,Orlando.
00:19:50.772,00:19:52.065,"All right, listen to me."
00:19:52.149,00:19:56.695,"They grabbed us from all over, and they brought us here to kill us, and they're still trying to kill us."
00:19:56.778,00:20:00.199,"And they're coming down the fucking road, and they're gonna be here any fucking second."
00:20:00.282,00:20:02.034,"Okay. What is your current location, sir?"
00:20:02.117,00:20:03.285,I am at a gas station!
00:20:03.368,00:20:06.538,Could you please just trace the call?
00:20:06.622,00:20:08.957,Of course. That's a… that's a great idea.
00:20:09.041,00:20:10.834,"We'll trace you, sir."
00:20:10.918,00:20:11.919,Sit tight.
00:20:12.002,00:20:13.337,-Okay. -Help's on the way.
00:20:13.420,00:20:14.880,Good.
00:20:18.967,00:20:20.594,"What'd they say, dude?"
00:20:21.637,00:20:23.430,-They said they're coming. -Thank Christ.
00:20:28.894,00:20:32.397,"You seem a little worked up, and you don't want it to go off by accident."
00:20:32.481,00:20:34.733,It's not gonna go off on accident. I own 7 guns.
00:20:36.944,00:20:38.403,Why do you own 7 guns?
00:20:38.487,00:20:46.828,"-Stand your ground. -Because it's my constitutional right to protect myself if I should ever happen to be getting fucking shot at, which is exactly what's happening right now. Is that okay?"
00:20:46.912,00:20:54.086,"So, those people that are shooting at you, they're just exercising the very same right?"
00:20:54.169,00:20:55.587,What the fuck are you talking about?
00:20:55.671,00:20:58.048,Will there be sugar after the Rebellion?
00:21:00.217,00:21:02.094,"Oh, sure. She's fine."
00:21:02.177,00:21:03.720,How are you?
00:21:10.143,00:21:11.561,"-Hey, you okay? -What's wrong?"
00:21:13.188,00:21:15.899,-What's wrong with her? -I don't… I don't… What happened to her?
00:21:15.983,00:21:16.900,"Damn. No, no, no."
00:21:16.984,00:21:18.318,-Fuck. -Come on. Sit up. Come on.
00:21:20.028,00:21:21.571,I think she's dianetic.
00:21:22.489,00:21:23.991,"Oh, my God."
00:21:35.752,00:21:36.962,What?
00:21:37.045,00:21:39.506,I'm not cleaning him up.
00:21:55.188,00:21:56.440,You're going to hell.
00:21:59.109,00:22:01.486,I don't believe in hell.
00:22:01.570,00:22:06.408,"As you so eloquently posted, I'm a godless elite."
00:22:06.491,00:22:12.789,"For the record, asshole, climate change is real."
00:22:29.973,00:22:31.516,I'll get a mop.
00:22:48.658,00:22:50.368,Sorry.
00:22:54.831,00:22:56.625,And sorry again.
00:23:01.129,00:23:02.756,Ugh.
00:23:22.442,00:23:23.902,Oh.
00:23:26.446,00:23:27.739,What?
00:23:29.032,00:23:30.075,Nothing.
00:23:30.158,00:23:31.076,"Come on, honey."
00:23:31.159,00:23:32.619,"Tell me, what's wrong?"
00:23:32.702,00:23:35.080,He's wearing a wedding ring.
00:23:35.163,00:23:36.790,He's a monster.
00:23:36.873,00:23:42.420,"Honey, he probably uses the N word, and not even in private. He probably uses it on Twitter."
00:23:42.504,00:23:48.552,Those people suffered 400 years of bondage at the hands of that piece of shit's ancestors.
00:23:48.635,00:23:49.594,Those people?
00:23:53.557,00:23:54.766,African Americans.
00:23:54.850,00:23:56.518,"-Honey, it's… -Privilege, Julius."
00:23:56.601,00:23:58.895,It's perfectly fine to call them black again.
00:24:01.857,00:24:03.108,NPR.
00:24:03.191,00:24:08.321,Which consists almost exclusively of… White people.
00:24:16.788,00:24:19.249,-Are you there? -Hey! We're here.
00:24:19.332,00:24:20.667,We got three of them.
00:24:20.750,00:24:23.879,"Mollie, Moses and Mr. Whymper."
00:24:23.962,00:24:25.839,Yeah? Great. Liberty got Boxer.
00:24:25.922,00:24:27.924,Stuck him full of arrows and then blew him to pieces.
00:24:28.008,00:24:31.303,It was brutal. Anyway… Snowball's headed toward you now.
00:24:31.386,00:24:32.846,She's maybe five minutes out.
00:24:32.929,00:24:35.098,"You gonna be ready, or do you need us to slow her down?"
00:24:35.182,00:24:37.309,-We're good. -No need.
00:24:37.392,00:24:38.310,-We're ready. -Great.
00:24:38.393,00:24:41.104,"She's unarmed, so have some fun with it."
00:24:41.188,00:24:42.272,Roger that.
00:24:42.355,00:24:43.773,Over and out.
00:24:45.066,00:24:47.027,"Honey, that's poison!"
00:24:49.613,00:24:51.031,You rigged the soda?
00:24:51.114,00:24:55.410,No. There are 43 grams of sugar in that bottle.
00:24:55.493,00:24:57.204,"Good God, Miranda. You really scared me."
00:24:57.287,00:24:59.539,I am not going to apologize for caring.
00:25:03.084,00:25:04.669,"All right, then."
00:25:04.753,00:25:06.463,-Let's get some more. -Okay.
00:25:13.428,00:25:14.888,What's going on?
00:25:15.639,00:25:17.224,"Okay, here she comes."
00:25:38.828,00:25:40.288,Help you?
00:25:50.757,00:25:52.592,"Get a pack of lights, please."
00:25:52.676,00:25:54.427,Coming right up.
00:25:54.511,00:25:55.845,You want to fill 'er up?
00:25:57.013,00:25:58.431,I don't have a car.
00:26:01.434,00:26:10.443,Uh… Everything okay?
00:26:16.700,00:26:19.536,"It's for, uh, emergencies."
00:26:22.163,00:26:24.582,Yeah. Little sweaty.
00:26:26.376,00:26:28.044,What state is this?
00:26:28.128,00:26:29.796,Sorry?
00:26:31.256,00:26:32.966,You don't understand the question?
00:26:39.180,00:26:41.433,"Well, I ain't most people."
00:26:46.271,00:26:49.274,You're in the glorious state of Arkansas.
00:26:58.241,00:27:08.960,"Is there anything else that-- No! No, please, no!"
00:27:09.044,00:27:11.087,Cigarettes in Arkansas only cost six bucks.
00:27:11.171,00:27:14.758,"-You fucked up, bitch! -No!"
00:29:32.145,00:29:33.480,Are you there?
00:29:37.942,00:29:40.195,"Affirmative, I'm here."
00:29:40.278,00:29:42.405,This is Liberty. I can't find Orwell.
00:29:47.327,00:29:49.579,Did anyone see Snowball go in?
00:30:16.231,00:30:38.294,I guess I should-- At least one of you is smart.
00:31:04.362,00:31:06.573,Don't fucking move!
00:31:07.198,00:31:09.200,Can you lower your gun?
00:31:09.284,00:31:11.619,-I'm a friendly. -How do I know that?
00:31:11.703,00:31:13.162,Why don't you pull that door handle?
00:31:15.957,00:31:18.167,"Then you'll blow the fuck up, and then you'll know."
00:31:18.251,00:31:20.628,"Oh, shit."
00:31:31.472,00:31:34.017,-Thanks. -You should not have shot that drone.
00:31:34.642,00:31:35.977,But now they can't see us.
00:31:36.060,00:31:38.313,Don't need to. You just told them we're here.
00:31:42.191,00:31:43.818,Oh. Where you going?
00:31:43.902,00:31:45.361,Saw some tracks earlier.
00:31:45.445,00:31:47.363,I'm gonna follow them.
00:31:47.447,00:31:49.115,Whose tracks?
00:31:50.533,00:31:52.660,"Hey, whose tracks?"
00:32:02.420,00:32:04.631,Why didn't they just kill you when you came in?
00:32:04.714,00:32:06.132,Don't care.
00:32:06.215,00:32:07.884,You want to hear my theory?
00:32:08.968,00:32:10.511,Not really.
00:32:10.595,00:32:12.597,Did you read that article?
00:32:12.680,00:32:27.236,"Every year, these liberal elites, you know, the globalist cucks who run the deep state, kidnap a bunch of normal folks like us and hunt us for fucking sport in, like, this mansion in Vermont or something."
00:32:27.320,00:32:29.405,I forwarded that to 50 friends.
00:32:29.489,00:32:31.449,It's not like I believed it.
00:32:31.532,00:32:32.659,You believe it?
00:32:32.742,00:32:34.077,That you have 50 friends?
00:32:34.160,00:32:36.120,"No, the rest of it."
00:32:38.539,00:32:44.087,Mm… This ain't Vermont.
00:32:44.170,00:32:45.630,Yeah.
00:32:45.713,00:32:47.340,Where you going now?
00:32:50.009,00:32:51.302,Oh.
00:32:55.640,00:32:56.808,I'm Gary.
00:32:56.891,00:32:58.893,"Shut the fuck up, Gary."
00:32:59.727,00:33:00.687,Mm.
00:33:13.950,00:33:15.827,-How fast are you? -What?
00:33:15.910,00:33:19.372,Train will be going slowest at the curve. We're not getting on standing still.
00:33:19.455,00:33:20.957,Wait!
00:34:14.343,00:34:15.219,Thanks.
00:34:15.303,00:34:16.888,Welcome.
00:34:29.400,00:34:30.693,Who's there?
00:34:32.028,00:34:33.988,"Come the fuck out, or I'll shoot!"
00:34:43.748,00:34:47.126,"Oh, come on."
00:34:47.210,00:34:50.213,-What? -They're not real.
00:34:50.296,00:34:53.591,Nah-uh. You know what we have here? Crisis actors.
00:34:56.052,00:34:59.222,the one train car with the open door is full of illegals?
00:34:59.305,00:35:01.015,"I mean, I mean, will you look at these fucks?"
00:35:01.099,00:35:02.809,"A little obvious, don't you think?"
00:35:04.852,00:35:07.980,Are you fucks trying to teach us a lesson?
00:35:09.649,00:35:13.236,I feel so sorry for immigrants and refugees.
00:35:13.319,00:35:17.198,I'm gonna have to rethink my entire position on immigration.
00:35:17.281,00:35:18.533,"No, Gary, they got a baby."
00:35:18.616,00:35:21.327,So? There are crisis babies.
00:35:25.581,00:35:34.382,"You're good, Mohammed, but if you don't cut the bullshit in three seconds, I am gonna blow your fucking dick off."
00:35:34.465,00:36:06.164,"One… -Ah! -Two… Gary. Come here, you fuck-- Hey! Hey!"
00:36:09.709,00:36:11.586,"-What? -Toss it, or we're fucking dead."
00:36:17.717,00:36:19.802,Hey! Hey!
00:36:43.159,00:36:46.871,"I don't know exactly where we are, but I'm an American."
00:36:46.954,00:36:48.039,American.
00:36:48.122,00:36:49.832,-American? -Yeah. Yeah.
00:36:49.916,00:36:50.917,"Her, too."
00:36:51.000,00:36:56.214,"Look, let me explain everything, sir, 'cause I know exactly what's going on here, okay?"
00:36:56.297,00:36:58.591,These are not real refugees.
00:36:58.674,00:37:01.552,These are crisis actors.
00:37:03.471,00:37:05.890,"I've been exposing these people, okay?"
00:37:05.973,00:37:09.727,They were placed on the train as a part of Manorgate.
00:37:09.810,00:37:13.731,This has all been an elaborate trap to try to ensnare us.
00:37:32.416,00:37:43.678,Did you hear him? Did you hear-- This is-- That's-- that's bullshit.
00:37:43.761,00:37:45.471,You're all fake! You're all fake!
00:37:50.476,00:37:52.645,"Gary, you have just got to chill, okay, buddy?"
00:37:52.728,00:37:55.398,"Now, those other refugees, they weren't part of this."
00:37:55.481,00:37:58.150,"They're real. I know. I have been embedded with them, okay?"
00:37:58.234,00:38:00.528,"And those soldiers, well, they're fucking real, too."
00:38:00.611,00:38:02.196,That train wasn't supposed to be stopped.
00:38:02.280,00:38:06.993,"So just calm the fuck down, and we will get through this, all right?"
00:38:07.076,00:38:08.411,And you know what?
00:38:08.494,00:38:10.830,I'll even give you guys a head start before I come after you.
00:38:10.913,00:38:12.456,How's that sound?
00:38:12.540,00:38:13.749,You good?
00:38:13.833,00:38:14.834,"Come on, buddy."
00:38:29.724,00:38:31.392,"Sayonara, sugar tits."
00:38:31.475,00:38:32.518,"No, no, no. Fuck. Shit."
00:38:35.938,00:38:37.523,"Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!"
00:38:37.606,00:38:39.317,"Shit, shit, shit, shit!"
00:38:43.195,00:38:45.656,"Fuck. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit."
00:38:45.740,00:38:47.199,"Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit."
00:39:50.388,00:39:53.432,"I'm Dino, and this Bojan."
00:39:54.642,00:39:56.685,You have papers?
00:39:56.769,00:39:58.687,Where are we?
00:39:58.771,00:40:00.481,Where you think?
00:40:00.564,00:40:13.077,"Well… I was, uh, eating in Mississippi when I got knocked out for what was at least 18 hours."
00:40:13.160,00:40:31.470,"So, taking that kind of into account, along with your accent and a license plate I fucking saw, I'm guessing I'm probably in… Serbia?"
00:40:31.554,00:40:33.264,Croatia?
00:40:33.347,00:40:36.183,"I'm in Croa… Croatia, then."
00:40:36.267,00:40:38.018,-How you get here? -Doesn't matter.
00:40:38.102,00:40:40.479,You need to call the American embassy.
00:40:45.067,00:40:46.861,Can you call the embassy?
00:40:46.944,00:40:49.405,You are hunted?
00:40:51.699,00:40:53.117,Who said I was hunted?
00:40:53.200,00:40:55.661,Don. Hmm?
00:40:56.620,00:40:58.247,You hunted like Don?
00:40:58.330,00:41:00.249,Who the fuck is Don?
00:41:03.961,00:41:05.796,Bring Don.
00:41:18.017,00:41:19.518,Can I have one of those?
00:41:19.602,00:41:21.061,No.
00:41:26.066,00:41:27.109,Don.
00:41:27.193,00:41:28.861,Howdy.
00:41:31.155,00:41:32.948,"Yeah, hunted like Don."
00:41:33.032,00:41:36.243,"Yeah. I told you, assholes."
00:41:36.911,00:41:41.415,"Yeah, I was heading north when the dogs came after me."
00:41:41.499,00:41:43.918,"Man, I thought I was fucking dead."
00:41:44.001,00:41:46.629,"You know, that it was those Manorgate assholes."
00:41:47.671,00:41:51.467,"Man, I was… I was relieved when it was just the fucking Russians, you know."
00:41:52.468,00:41:54.428,"Little more. Little more, pal."
00:41:56.889,00:41:59.391,And what was up with that crate?
00:41:59.475,00:42:03.354,"I mean, why did they give us weapons before they started picking us off?"
00:42:03.437,00:42:05.189,To make it more fair?
00:42:07.775,00:42:10.069,I thought they were all vegans.
00:42:12.071,00:42:16.492,"Well, I cannot wait to… to blow the lid off this shit."
00:42:16.575,00:42:22.039,"Because we gonna be on Hannity, you and me, just like them two Jew boys that fucked Nixon up."
00:42:24.750,00:42:26.710,"You want to share what you're thinking, sweetie?"
00:42:27.920,00:42:29.046,Mm-mmm.
00:42:29.129,00:42:30.714,Come on.
00:42:30.798,00:42:33.008,You don't care why they're doing this to us?
00:42:33.092,00:42:35.261,"Well, they're trying to kill me. I don't give a shit why."
00:42:57.992,00:43:00.703,"Well, if it ain't Uncle Sam's nephew."
00:43:33.485,00:43:40.284,So you're telling me that they built an entire gas station out here just to convince you this was the middle of Arkansas?
00:43:41.243,00:43:43.912,What kind of sick individual even comes up with that? It's horrifying.
00:43:45.497,00:43:48.709,"Okay, we're gonna get back to the embassy. I'm gonna contact the State Department."
00:43:48.792,00:43:50.669,We're gonna get military support out here.
00:43:50.753,00:43:52.755,-We're gonna find these animals. -Attaboy.
00:43:57.509,00:43:59.637,'cause they think they're better than us.
00:43:59.720,00:44:02.556,"Yeah, but… but why you?"
00:44:02.640,00:44:05.184,"I mean, it seems so personal, right?"
00:44:05.267,00:44:06.852,What?
00:44:06.935,00:44:10.356,"No, no, I mean, I'm… I'm just asking, why pick you of all people?"
00:44:10.439,00:44:12.983,You must have done something to pop up on their radar somehow.
00:44:13.067,00:44:15.903,"Otherwise, why target you so specifically?"
00:44:15.986,00:44:18.989,-We didn't do shit. -Okay.
00:44:20.616,00:44:21.700,-our fucking fault? -No.
00:44:21.784,00:44:25.871,"No, no, that's not what I'm… -No, I would never blame the victim. -Yeah."
00:44:25.954,00:44:27.873,"There'd have to be a reason, is all."
00:44:29.541,00:44:46.058,"Can you think of anything… anything at all, no matter how minor… that might make somebody want to try something as… What? No. No! My God!"
00:44:46.725,00:44:48.977,Stop the car! Stop the car!
00:44:49.061,00:44:50.854,No! No!
00:44:50.938,00:44:54.149,"Oh, my God! Oh!"
00:44:54.233,00:44:57.778,"Are you out of your mind, woman?"
00:44:57.861,00:44:59.363,"No, no. Why did you do that?"
00:44:59.446,00:45:01.532,"Oh, no. Why did you do that?"
00:45:01.615,00:45:03.826,"Oh, God. Is he dead?"
00:45:03.909,00:45:06.870,"You, what is wrong with you? What is wrong with you?"
00:45:06.954,00:45:10.416,"You are not right. Oh, my God."
00:45:10.499,00:45:14.086,"What the… Oh, fuck!"
00:45:14.169,00:45:17.423,Why did you do that? Why… He was trying to save us.
00:45:17.506,00:45:21.051,He was… Oh.
00:45:21.135,00:45:22.719,Jesus.
00:45:23.929,00:45:25.973,"Nope, just Gary."
00:45:26.890,00:45:28.392,How'd you know he was lying?
00:45:28.475,00:45:30.269,Because everyone is lying.
00:45:31.687,00:45:38.819,"Well, maybe… maybe you should've waited to kill him until… till he told us why they're doing this."
00:45:39.695,00:45:41.738,Pretty sure he wanted us to tell him.
00:45:46.201,00:45:48.162,There was four down out of the gate.
00:45:48.245,00:45:50.497,A guy got grenaded.
00:45:50.581,00:45:53.876,You said there were three at the gas station.
00:45:53.959,00:45:58.839,And I assume this is the guy you hopped a train with.
00:45:58.922,00:46:00.340,Mm-hmm.
00:46:01.884,00:46:03.719,That just leaves you and me.
00:46:04.970,00:46:06.388,Yeah.
00:46:07.681,00:46:09.349,What-- What is that?
00:46:10.392,00:46:12.603,It's where Mr. Bullshit was taking us.
00:46:16.773,00:46:20.944,"This seems a little obvious, like… like maybe they wanted us to find it."
00:46:21.820,00:46:25.824,"Depends on whether they're smart pretending to be idiots, or idiots pretending to be smart."
00:46:25.908,00:46:28.160,"Well, I say fuck those fuckers, okay?"
00:46:28.243,00:46:30.913,We got us a car. Let's just fucking go.
00:46:30.996,00:46:33.123,Okay? And I'm driving. Give me the key.
00:46:33.207,00:46:34.708,No.
00:46:39.129,00:46:40.172,No?
00:46:45.135,00:46:46.428,No.
00:46:52.142,00:46:57.856,My mama used to tell me this story about the jackrabbit and the box turtle.
00:46:57.940,00:47:04.947,"The jackrabbit is a real dick, 'cause he brags all the time."
00:47:05.030,00:47:07.616,Says nobody's faster than him.
00:47:08.825,00:47:10.410,"And, well, it's true."
00:47:12.037,00:47:15.332,"'Cause every time he races, the jackrabbit always wins."
00:47:16.166,00:47:19.461,"The whole fucking forest has to put up with his shit… day in, day out."
00:47:19.545,00:47:21.880,Fucker always wants to race just to rub it in some more.
00:47:21.964,00:47:27.594,"So the box turtle figures, Why not? I'll give it a try."
00:47:27.678,00:47:30.556,"And the jackrabbit, like, laughs. Like, Okay, this'll be fun."
00:47:30.639,00:47:33.016,So let's fucking go. So bang!
00:47:33.100,00:47:35.602,Jackrabbit leaves the box turtle in his fucking dust.
00:47:35.686,00:47:37.604,"I mean, he is way out in front."
00:47:37.688,00:47:39.898,"Of course he is, 'cause jackrabbit always wins."
00:47:39.982,00:47:43.527,But he wants to put on a show. He'll make it seem close.
00:47:43.610,00:47:46.321,"So he stops, and he takes a nap."
00:47:53.662,00:47:55.956,He sleeps longer than he wanted to.
00:47:58.500,00:48:04.089,"By the time he wakes up… I mean, he knows he's fucked."
00:48:04.172,00:48:06.550,"Jackrabbit… goes full tilt, but it's too late."
00:48:06.633,00:48:14.516,"The box turtle crosses the finish line first, Goes fucking wild."
00:48:16.810,00:48:20.397,"Later that night, box turtle's having dinner with his family."
00:48:21.648,00:48:24.359,He's telling his little box turtles how he did it.
00:48:25.277,00:48:33.160,"I mean, never give up. I… Just keep crawling forwards, and… you can overcome just about anything."
00:48:36.455,00:48:38.040,Door smashes in.
00:48:40.459,00:48:42.044,It's the jackrabbit.
00:48:43.879,00:48:45.756,And he has a hammer.
00:48:47.883,00:48:52.262,Smashes up the wife and kids first so the box turtle has to watch them die.
00:48:54.097,00:48:56.308,And then it's his turn.
00:48:56.391,00:49:06.985,Once the whole family's broken into little pieces… Every last bite.
00:49:16.453,00:49:18.830,'Cause the jackrabbit always wins.
00:49:21.667,00:49:23.960,Your mama told you that story?
00:49:25.754,00:49:27.130,So… so wait.
00:49:27.214,00:49:29.299,"So, who's the rabbit?"
00:49:29.383,00:49:32.135,"I mean, is it us or them?"
00:49:39.017,00:49:41.395,"You see a pig with a shirt on, right?"
00:49:45.107,00:49:46.817,A little pig.
00:49:58.954,00:50:01.289,Where the hell is Oliver?
00:50:01.373,00:50:03.125,He left to get them hours ago.
00:50:03.208,00:50:04.876,"I'm sure he's fine, Ted."
00:50:04.960,00:50:07.921,"Oh, wow. Ava DuVernay just liked one of my posts."
00:50:08.004,00:50:10.674,"You're friends with Ava, too?"
00:50:10.757,00:50:12.300,No. Maybe.
00:50:12.384,00:50:14.010,We met at a Time 100 dinner.
00:50:14.094,00:50:16.638,This is the photo that she liked. It's from when I was in Haiti.
00:50:19.141,00:50:20.934,"Remind us, what were you doing there again?"
00:50:21.017,00:50:26.231,"You were curing AIDS in a favela. Isn't that… -Don't joke about AIDS. -No, no, no. I'm not joking."
00:50:26.314,00:50:32.487,"AIDS is very, very serious, and thank God Martin is single-handedly taking it on."
00:50:32.571,00:50:36.783,"Okay. First of all, there are no favelas in Haiti."
00:50:36.867,00:50:40.829,"-That's Brazil. -Well, I just… I heard that you got a girl pregnant down there."
00:50:40.912,00:50:43.457,-Ooh. -I fell in love.
00:50:43.540,00:50:46.209,"-Hope she was pro-choice. -Don't joke about choice, man, please."
00:50:46.293,00:50:53.258,"What matters is that Haiti is in the midst of a decades-long humanitarian crisis, -and it needs all the help it can get. -Thank you."
00:50:53.341,00:50:55.177,-Does it need Martin's semen? -Okay.
00:50:55.260,00:50:59.222,"-Enough, Richard. -Guys, we're all on the same team."
00:50:59.306,00:51:00.348,Did you say guys?
00:51:00.432,00:51:01.933,I'm sorry. I gendered it.
00:51:02.017,00:51:04.519,-Where are they? -Just call Oliver on the radio.
00:51:04.603,00:51:12.319,"I mean, they think he's part of the embassy, so he's… Uh, Sergeant Dale, little help?"
00:51:12.402,00:51:13.904,"Please, let's keep the voices down."
00:51:13.987,00:51:17.073,-Why? They're in a car. -You hired me to consult you.
00:51:17.157,00:51:18.700,I'm consulting you.
00:51:18.784,00:51:21.328,What was the name of that movie you did again?
00:51:21.411,00:51:22.746,Tears of the Sun.
00:51:22.829,00:51:24.498,"I mean, that's actually what they called it?"
00:51:24.581,00:51:25.916,Tears of the Sun?
00:51:25.999,00:51:27.584,Why is the sun crying?
00:51:29.211,00:51:31.671,"It came out? I mean, like, in theaters and stuff?"
00:51:31.755,00:51:33.465,-Bruce Willis was in it. -What?
00:51:33.548,00:51:34.466,I love Bruce.
00:51:36.635,00:51:39.930,"-Sorry, Athena. -Well, I'm gonna go take a piss."
00:51:40.013,00:51:41.389,Who has the hand sanitizer?
00:51:41.473,00:51:44.810,"-Christ, Richard, just rough it. -Go fuck yourself, Liberty."
00:51:44.893,00:51:47.270,"Hey, watch out for the trip wires."
00:51:47.354,00:51:48.772,I know.
00:52:01.076,00:52:02.953,Fucking rough it.
00:52:03.954,00:52:06.998,As if you ever roughed a thing in your fucking life.
00:52:15.006,00:52:17.509,Hey. Is this your pig?
00:52:42.784,00:52:44.244,Everybody up. Like we practiced.
00:52:45.704,00:52:48.039,"Leave the rifles. Sidearms, now. Come on, come on."
00:52:48.790,00:52:50.333,Shit.
00:53:03.179,00:53:05.223,-Richard? -Shh.
00:53:05.307,00:53:06.933,Don't shush me.
00:53:18.361,00:53:20.113,Shit.
00:53:39.633,00:53:41.468,Stop! Stop!
00:53:45.180,00:53:46.640,Orwell!
00:53:49.768,00:53:52.270,How the hell did that get in here?
00:53:52.354,00:53:57.651,"-You almost fucking shot me. -Well I didn't, did I? Because you're not… Hey, bitch."
00:54:28.181,00:54:29.140,Argh!
00:54:29.224,00:55:29.075,"No, Snowball. No, no, no. I didn't-- No, no, no."
00:55:38.835,00:55:40.503,You hick.
00:55:42.630,00:55:43.798,Goddamn.
00:55:54.017,00:55:56.811,"Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, it's me."
00:55:56.895,00:55:58.897,Thank you for all the help.
00:55:58.980,00:56:00.982,Fuck you. I dropped the pig.
00:56:02.150,00:56:03.401,"Come on, give me a gun."
00:56:04.736,00:56:06.905,Do you think you could find one?
00:56:11.534,00:56:15.789,"Don, is there anything you would like to ask her?"
00:56:16.539,00:56:17.415,What?
00:56:17.499,00:56:23.379,You got mad that I killed the fucker in the car before you could ask him anything.
00:56:23.463,00:56:26.674,"And I thought, you know, now's your chance."
00:56:31.805,00:56:34.390,Why are you doing this to us?
00:56:34.474,00:56:36.601,Because Jesus told me to.
00:56:37.769,00:56:38.853,"Well, there's your answer."
00:56:38.937,00:56:50.573,"Whoa! Hey, hey. Come on, you can't just-- Hey, miss… do you think you should be afforded mercy just 'cause you're a girl?"
00:56:52.325,00:56:53.993,No.
00:56:54.077,00:56:57.080,What the fuck is wrong with you?
00:57:06.297,00:57:07.715,Don!
00:57:09.884,00:57:11.261,Don.
00:57:11.344,00:57:15.932,Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hey. Hey.
00:57:16.015,00:57:17.600,What's going on?
00:57:18.852,00:57:19.936,You one of them?
00:57:20.019,00:57:22.230,What? No!
00:57:23.982,00:57:26.151,You drop the gun and answer her.
00:57:28.236,00:57:29.946,I'm not dropping my gun.
00:57:33.158,00:57:34.868,Answer her.
00:57:34.951,00:57:36.411,Who is this?
00:57:36.494,00:57:38.788,You don't have to pretend anymore. She's figured it out.
00:57:42.167,00:57:44.002,I don't know who the fuck that is.
00:57:44.085,00:57:45.837,-Shoot her. -Drop the gun.
00:57:45.920,00:57:47.255,"Fucking shoot her, Don!"
00:57:47.338,00:57:49.299,They're playing you. They're fucking with you.
00:57:49.382,00:57:50.717,I'm on your side here.
00:57:50.800,00:57:52.010,Just drop the gun.
00:57:58.141,00:57:59.726,Don?
00:57:59.809,00:58:01.144,Is she hurt?
00:58:01.227,00:58:07.192,Don's dead… because of me.
00:58:08.151,00:58:10.487,Then I guess you'd better come and get me.
00:58:28.713,00:58:30.673,I heard them call you a consultant.
00:58:31.299,00:58:32.967,You trained these fuckers?
00:58:34.344,00:58:36.346,Yeah.
00:58:36.429,00:58:38.223,How much did they pay you?
00:58:39.599,00:58:41.017,Nothing.
00:58:42.810,00:58:44.646,I owed her a favor.
00:58:47.982,00:58:49.526,And where is she?
00:58:49.609,00:58:52.654,Why? You won.
00:58:54.030,00:58:55.281,Just go home.
00:58:58.535,00:59:14.842,"Because I am, like… Hmm… And, uh… I work at a car rental company."
00:59:16.344,00:59:18.429,And there is nowhere to put that.
00:59:19.514,00:59:38.908,"So maybe today… I can, like… Hmm… So, where the fuck is she?"
00:59:45.248,00:59:46.249,"Okay, okay."
00:59:48.543,00:59:50.420,"-Sorry. -Okay, okay, okay, okay."
00:59:50.503,00:59:52.880,Okay.
00:59:57.760,00:59:59.554,You have no idea what you're up against.
01:00:00.930,01:00:05.643,She's… She's been training for eight months.
01:00:05.727,01:00:07.687,She's gonna rip you into pieces.
01:00:07.770,01:00:09.022,We'll see.
01:00:09.105,01:00:12.025,You… you were in the service?
01:00:12.108,01:00:14.235,Uh… yes.
01:00:18.364,01:00:19.324,Were you?
01:00:19.407,01:00:21.034,-National Guard. -Mm.
01:00:23.745,01:00:25.455,So you were never in the shit.
01:00:27.248,01:00:28.833,I'm in it now.
01:00:29.792,01:00:31.628,That's a nice way of looking at it.
01:00:33.504,01:00:35.340,Hey.
01:00:35.423,01:00:36.841,Thank you for your service.
01:00:51.272,01:00:52.815,"Hello, Paul."
01:00:52.899,01:00:54.651,Hey. Athena. Hi.
01:00:54.734,01:00:56.235,What are you doing in my office?
01:00:57.487,01:00:58.863,Take a seat.
01:01:04.452,01:01:05.787,Athena.
01:01:07.205,01:01:08.581,Have a seat.
01:01:14.545,01:01:17.465,"So, you're aware Martin's account got hacked last week, right?"
01:01:20.426,01:01:23.721,And Martin's one of my closest friends.
01:01:23.805,01:01:26.724,So you know how embarrassing it was for him.
01:01:26.808,01:01:30.061,All the extramarital communiqués.
01:01:30.144,01:01:34.440,I call it sending his wife's oncologist pictures of his cock.
01:01:34.524,01:01:36.401,"I mean, there are more than just the cock pics."
01:01:36.484,01:01:41.781,"There were texts and e-mails, and he said some extraordinarily critical things about the president."
01:01:43.783,01:01:45.743,-free speech still exists. -Don't do that.
01:01:45.827,01:01:47.954,"Don't First Amendment me, please."
01:01:48.663,01:01:50.540,It's not a country. It's a business.
01:01:51.290,01:01:53.292,"A business, and there are optics."
01:01:55.336,01:01:57.547,"No, he realized he had to take one for the team."
01:01:59.215,01:02:00.633,"We have a team, our team."
01:02:04.846,01:02:11.519,"Do you recall a text thread you had with Martin, Peter, Richard and Liberty, amongst others, December 17th at ten o'clock in the morning?"
01:02:17.316,01:02:18.651,"Go-- go ahead, Nicole."
01:02:22.447,01:02:26.743,Martin. Did anyone see what our ratfucker-in-chief just did?
01:02:26.826,01:02:30.204,Liberty. Yes. Day equals ruined.
01:02:30.288,01:02:32.290,Peter. Infuriating.
01:02:32.373,01:02:34.584,Athena. At least the hunt's coming up.
01:02:34.667,01:02:39.088,Nothing better than going out to The Manor and slaughtering a dozen deplorables.
01:02:39.172,01:02:42.550,Miranda. We promised not to talk about The Manor on text.
01:02:42.633,01:02:44.886,Ted. Viva El Manor.
01:02:44.969,01:02:47.138,Liberty. Deleting this thread.
01:02:55.521,01:02:57.273,who believe this is a real thing?
01:02:59.901,01:03:02.487,That you're hunting human beings for sport.
01:03:14.540,01:03:18.002,Wh-- wh-- what?
01:03:20.463,01:03:22.215,They're going bananas. They're going berserk.
01:03:22.298,01:03:24.926,"Reddit. I mean, I don't know the names of them all."
01:03:25.009,01:03:29.847,"But, anyway, somebody pulled a property-tax record for the manor that you bought in Vermont."
01:03:29.931,01:03:33.810,"Manor? No, I don't own a fucking manor in Vermont."
01:03:34.602,01:03:36.270,It's a three-bedroom house.
01:03:39.190,01:03:40.024,Manor?
01:03:40.107,01:03:42.068,-No. -Deplorables.
01:03:42.151,01:03:44.695,It's… charged.
01:03:44.779,01:03:49.700,"Well, I initially typed fucking rednecks, but then I decided that wasn't specific… -Hey, come on. -What?"
01:03:49.784,01:03:52.370,"What would you prefer I call them, Paul?"
01:03:55.748,01:03:58.167,"-Academically challenged racists? -Hey, hey."
01:04:00.002,01:04:06.133,We have our best team at reputation management flooding… flooding the search engines in the hopes this thing doesn't go mainstream.
01:04:06.217,01:04:11.889,But even if by some miracle it doesn't… and I really don't see that happening… Martin did what he had to.
01:04:11.973,01:04:14.141,Richard did what he had to. He's out at BlueWest.
01:04:14.225,01:04:17.520,Julius and Miranda had to step down from their foundation.
01:04:17.603,01:04:19.313,Liberty exited her fund.
01:04:19.397,01:04:21.190,I'm sorry.
01:04:21.899,01:04:23.484,You got to go.
01:04:25.444,01:04:30.408,Paul… it was just a joke.
01:04:30.491,01:04:32.577,One joke.
01:04:34.954,01:04:36.873,"I mean, I wish this didn't happen."
01:04:37.999,01:04:48.259,"I really do, but this… idea is out there, and these people believe it, and they're not going away."
01:04:54.098,01:04:55.766,What people?
01:04:57.560,01:05:04.233,What people believe I'm hunting human beings at my manor?
01:05:04.817,01:05:07.904,What fucking people?
01:05:09.655,01:05:12.199,"Okay, this is gary4USA."
01:05:12.283,01:05:14.368,He's got a podcast called The Confederate Files.
01:05:14.452,01:05:16.829,He's a P score 8.5.
01:05:16.913,01:05:18.873,What does that P stand for again?
01:05:18.956,01:05:20.416,Piece of shit. I vote in.
01:05:21.751,01:05:23.210,In? Another in. Okay.
01:05:24.712,01:05:25.963,BigGameShane.
01:05:26.047,01:05:28.424,Trigger warning. I'm sorry. I think the pic speaks for itself.
01:05:28.507,01:05:29.717,-In. -He's an 8.8.
01:05:29.800,01:05:30.635,In.
01:05:30.718,01:05:32.553,"Guys, we can't include everybody, okay?"
01:05:32.637,01:05:36.098,"Thousands of people posted about Manorgate, so… Christ. It's a gate now?"
01:05:36.182,01:05:38.100,"Well, they ruined water and pizza. Why not manors?"
01:05:38.184,01:05:43.814,"Listen, I want to slaughter all of them just like everybody else here, okay, but our military consultant says we got to cap it out at 12."
01:05:43.898,01:05:46.108,-Why? -It's our first time.
01:05:46.192,01:05:47.526,"Safety reasons, okay?"
01:05:47.610,01:05:49.654,Heavens. God forbid somebody gets hurt.
01:05:49.737,01:05:51.822,"Is that a kimono? That's appropriation, Richard."
01:05:51.906,01:05:53.324,"Hey, where are Liberty and Ted?"
01:05:54.867,01:05:56.035,"They lost everything, Richard."
01:05:56.118,01:05:58.079,They lost their jobs and their reputations.
01:05:59.914,01:06:02.959,"But I'm dealing with it with, you know, drugs and alcohol, like a normal person."
01:06:03.042,01:06:05.544,"Excuse me, did anyone else here get reassigned to Croatia?"
01:06:05.628,01:06:08.589,-No? No? Because I did. -That was a blessing in disguise.
01:06:08.673,01:06:10.633,We're gonna build that gas station for pennies.
01:06:10.716,01:06:12.593,-There's no extradition… -Next slide.
01:06:18.099,01:06:24.355,"Listen. Listen, listen. If we don't have at least one person of color in this, -it is going to be problematic. -Um, I'm playing an Arab refugee."
01:06:24.438,01:06:26.691,I'm from Connecticut. Isn't that a little problematic?
01:06:28.192,01:06:30.277,It was your idea. It was weird when you said it.
01:06:30.361,01:06:35.324,Because we need to lean in to the stereotype… -Correct. -…to let them just expose their biases.
01:06:35.408,01:06:37.827,"Yeah, or we can just shoot 'em as soon as they grab their guns."
01:06:37.910,01:06:40.079,"Then they're not gonna know why we're killing them, okay?"
01:06:43.040,01:06:46.585,Okay. Justice4Yall. She's a 6.5.
01:06:46.669,01:06:49.922,This is what she says… Fuck this bitch.
01:06:50.006,01:06:54.719,Athena Stone murders innocent men and women-- I don't need to hear more.
01:07:01.267,01:07:02.935,That's our Snowball.
01:07:19.660,01:07:20.911,Why the fuck would I do that?
01:07:20.995,01:07:23.664,There's a shaped C-4 charge underneath the gate.
01:07:25.875,01:07:27.543,I could blow you up right now.
01:07:28.669,01:07:30.337,But where's the fun in that?
01:07:31.464,01:07:32.840,No guns.
01:07:32.923,01:07:35.468,Put it in the mailbox. Now.
01:09:24.118,01:09:28.914,"People go their entire lives without realizing the most simple, obvious truth."
01:09:30.708,01:09:36.422,The only way to properly slice tomatoes is with a bread knife.
01:09:40.134,01:09:41.552,Did you kill Don?
01:09:42.928,01:09:43.762,Uh-huh.
01:09:43.846,01:09:46.682,Because I convinced you he was one of us.
01:09:46.765,01:09:48.392,Was he?
01:09:49.059,01:09:51.020,Maybe.
01:09:51.103,01:09:52.646,Maybe not.
01:09:55.357,01:09:56.692,Who am I?
01:09:59.069,01:10:02.781,Huh? Who… am… I?
01:10:03.449,01:10:06.577,"Lady, I don't know who you are."
01:10:06.660,01:10:08.037,I just know that you're crazy.
01:10:08.120,01:10:09.955,I am crazy.
01:10:10.039,01:10:11.457,But I know I'm crazy.
01:10:11.540,01:10:14.960,"And if you know you're crazy, then you're not crazy."
01:10:15.044,01:10:18.631,"So that just makes me really, really mad."
01:10:18.714,01:10:19.840,Okay.
01:10:20.799,01:10:22.593,"So, who am I?"
01:10:22.676,01:10:26.555,Crystal May Creasey.
01:10:26.639,01:10:30.184,"Born in Mississippi, Whites Crossing."
01:10:30.267,01:10:31.143,Fitting.
01:10:31.227,01:10:37.149,"Dropped out of school at 12, right around the time your daddy was killed by the police when they raided the methamphetamine lab."
01:10:37.233,01:10:39.944,Your mother joined him soon after that. Overdose.
01:10:40.027,01:10:42.863,Probably the last batch of Daddy's stuff.
01:10:44.531,01:10:46.116,Romantic.
01:10:49.286,01:10:55.668,"You know, most people think that you should use cheddar in a grilled cheese."
01:10:56.919,01:10:58.337,But I use Gruyère.
01:11:00.047,01:11:02.508,Nothing else has that kind of melt.
01:11:03.842,01:11:09.181,"After your mom died, you bounced from part-time job to part-time job, to welfare and back."
01:11:09.265,01:11:12.059,"More times than I could count, honestly."
01:11:12.142,01:11:15.938,The only consistency was your inability to stay employed.
01:11:17.481,01:11:22.987,"I mean, this country belongs to the uneducated and ignorant as much as it belongs to me."
01:11:24.113,01:11:25.698,"You fail, we pay."
01:11:26.740,01:11:36.375,"Eventually, a cow falls on your head or you blow your brains out in a parking lot because you finally realize what a waste your life truly was."
01:11:36.458,01:11:38.085,"But not you, Crystal."
01:11:39.295,01:11:42.381,You decided to go on the Internet and run your stupid mouth.
01:11:44.758,01:11:50.556,"Thirteen months ago, you posted this on a message board under the screen name Justice4Yall."
01:11:50.639,01:11:53.225,I want to make sure I… I get it exactly right.
01:11:56.353,01:11:58.439,Fuck this bitch.
01:11:58.522,01:12:03.610,Athena Stone murders innocent men and women for sport.
01:12:03.694,01:12:06.613,The evidence is all there.
01:12:06.697,01:12:10.826,T-H-E-I-R.
01:12:11.410,01:12:13.245,"Her manor, her travel records."
01:12:13.329,01:12:19.585,"Oh, and in case you were still on the fence, she fucking admitted to it in a text message."
01:12:21.045,01:12:24.381,Admitted was all caps.
01:12:25.758,01:12:27.718,-Huh. -Huh?
01:12:27.801,01:12:29.511,That's all you have to say for yourself?
01:12:29.595,01:12:37.728,"Everybody you kidnapped and killed, that's 'cause they busted you and your friends and put it on the Internet?"
01:12:37.811,01:12:41.106,No one busted us. We were joking.
01:12:41.190,01:12:42.900,But you ignorami took it literally.
01:12:42.983,01:12:47.488,You actually believed we were hunting human beings for sport.
01:12:48.113,01:12:49.656,But you are.
01:12:49.740,01:12:51.533,-What? -Hunting human beings for sport.
01:12:51.617,01:12:53.077,"-No. -Oh, yeah."
01:12:53.160,01:12:55.204,It wasn't true.
01:12:58.540,01:13:02.127,"-This is your manor, isn't it? -It's not a fucking manor."
01:13:02.211,01:13:04.797,It's a house I rented in Croatia and had decorated.
01:13:04.880,01:13:10.344,"Okay, right, but it's yours, and you're hunting people, so it's… I mean, it's true."
01:13:10.427,01:13:15.974,Now. Now it's true because you made it true.
01:13:16.058,01:13:23.440,"You people, you take anything you want, and you twist it around until it fits into your backwards fucking worldview."
01:13:23.524,01:13:27.611,"You wanted it to be true, so you decided it was."
01:13:29.905,01:13:32.116,This was your idea.
01:13:34.159,01:13:38.664,Well… not my idea.
01:13:39.373,01:13:47.381,"Ooh, I did not want to mess up your big grilled-cheese speech, but… oh, you done fucked up, lady."
01:13:49.049,01:13:52.136,"See, you got the wrong Crystal."
01:13:53.303,01:13:56.515,There's another Crystal May Creasey back home.
01:13:58.267,01:14:00.352,But she spells May with an E.
01:14:02.312,01:14:05.149,"Hey, I get her mail sometimes."
01:14:05.232,01:14:10.737,"And my dad's an asshole, but I don't think he ever did drugs."
01:14:10.821,01:14:18.912,"And my mom… she's alive, too."
01:14:22.666,01:14:24.543,Can we call her? Let's call her right now.
01:14:24.626,01:14:25.836,-No. No way. -Give me the phone.
01:14:25.919,01:14:27.713,-I'll call her up. -Do I look fucking stupid?
01:14:27.796,01:14:29.673,"Fine. I'll give you her number, and you can call."
01:14:29.756,01:14:31.258,-That's not gonna happen. -Yeah.
01:14:32.926,01:14:35.095,"Oh, you don't really care about the truth, do you?"
01:14:35.179,01:14:36.680,Of course I do.
01:14:36.763,01:14:40.184,The only difference is I'm right.
01:14:42.227,01:14:43.854,"Hey, maybe."
01:14:46.148,01:14:47.065,Maybe not.
01:14:49.151,01:14:53.280,"Now, do I have to keep listening to Beethoven, or can we fucking get on with it?"
01:15:24.603,01:15:25.521,That was good.
01:15:33.153,01:15:34.530,Mm.
01:16:18.699,01:16:19.992,"Hey, Crystal."
01:16:27.082,01:16:28.875,"You need a gun now, bitch?"
01:16:28.959,01:16:30.961,That's fucking cheating!
01:16:59.281,01:17:00.866,Fuck you!
01:18:01.218,01:18:03.637,-One second. -Yeah.
01:18:27.327,01:18:28.453,No more glass!
01:19:22.466,01:19:23.467,I got you.
01:19:27.137,01:19:28.513,Ah.
01:19:54.331,01:19:55.874,Okay.
01:20:08.386,01:20:09.888,Hey.
01:20:10.514,01:20:12.140,"I got you, too."
01:20:15.519,01:20:17.437,"Hey, can I ask you a question?"
01:20:24.194,01:20:26.071,Why did you call me Snowball?
01:20:27.447,01:20:29.533,It's a reference.
01:20:29.616,01:20:32.369,To George Orwell's Animal Farm.
01:20:34.246,01:20:36.039,He's a pig.
01:20:36.873,01:20:40.252,"Yeah, but why am I Snowball?"
01:20:42.546,01:20:44.965,Snowball is an idealist.
01:20:45.048,01:20:48.635,He… he wants to make the world a better place.
01:20:48.718,01:20:55.058,"That's why the other pigs make up lies about him, turn him into the enemy."
01:20:57.894,01:20:59.980,I think you should be Snowball.
01:21:01.815,01:21:04.359,You read Animal Farm?
01:21:05.402,01:21:07.237,"Yes, ma'am, I did."
01:21:11.032,01:21:15.078,Can I… ask you a question?
01:21:17.747,01:21:20.458,Are you Justice4Yall?
01:21:21.877,01:21:24.588,"I mean, come on."
01:21:24.671,01:21:26.548,We're both dead.
01:21:26.631,01:21:28.550,Just tell me.
01:21:28.633,01:21:31.011,"I got the right Crystal, didn't I?"
01:21:33.722,01:21:36.808,"No, ma'am, you did not."
01:21:43.607,01:21:45.191,Whoops.
01:23:37.762,01:23:46.646,"The, uh… assholes you work for tried to kill me, so I killed them instead."
01:23:46.730,01:23:48.356,Now I want to go home.
01:23:50.400,01:23:52.152,That gonna be a problem?
01:23:52.902,01:23:54.779,"-Certainly not, ma'am. -No."
01:23:55.697,01:23:58.199,May I… may I pour that for you?
01:23:58.283,01:23:59.659,Yeah.
01:24:11.004,01:24:14.382,-We have fantastic caviar. It's osetra… -Yeah.
