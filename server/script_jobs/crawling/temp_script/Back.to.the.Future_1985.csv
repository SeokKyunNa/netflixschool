00:01:35.678,00:01:37.930,on all 1985 model Toyotas.
00:01:40.016,00:01:43.310,at a better price with better service anywhere in Hill Valley.
00:01:43.394,00:01:46.104,That’s Statler Toyota in downtown Hill Valley.
00:01:46.188,00:01:56.490,"But hurry. These prices are only good till the end of– In other news, officials at the Pacific Nuclear research facility..."
00:01:56.574,00:01:59.201,have denied the rumor that a case of missing plutonium...
00:01:59.285,00:02:01.954,was in fact stolen from their vault two weeks ago.
00:02:02.038,00:02:05.707,A Libyan terrorist group had claimed responsibility for the alleged theft.
00:02:09.545,00:02:11.463,to a simple clerical error.
00:02:11.547,00:02:15.009,"The F.B.I., which is investigating the matter, had no comment."
00:02:17.053,00:02:22.140,"Twelve wooden crates filled with cocaine washed ashore near Boca Raton, Florida, yesterday."
00:02:57.093,00:02:58.594,"Hey, Doc?"
00:03:00.888,00:03:03.098,Doc?
00:03:03.182,00:03:05.267,Hello. Anybody home?
00:03:08.020,00:03:09.939,"What’s goin’ on? Oh, God."
00:03:11.107,00:03:13.108,"Oh, Jesus!"
00:03:13.192,00:03:16.487,That is disgusting. Where the hell is everybody?
00:04:36.525,00:04:38.527,Whoa.
00:04:40.863,00:04:44.033,Rock ’n’ roll.
00:04:50.539,00:04:52.165,Yo.
00:04:52.249,00:04:54.501,"Hey, Doc. Where are you?"
00:04:54.585,00:04:57.879,I’ve found you. Can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15?
00:04:57.963,00:05:00.632,"I made a major breakthrough, and I’ll need your assistance."
00:05:00.716,00:05:02.342,1:15 in the morning?
00:05:02.426,00:05:05.762,"Doc, what’s goin’ on? Where you been all week? Workin’."
00:05:05.846,00:05:09.224,"Where’s Einstein? Is he with you? Yeah, he’s right here."
00:05:09.308,00:05:11.893,"You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week."
00:05:11.977,00:05:14.271,"My equipment? That reminds me, Marty."
00:05:14.355,00:05:16.273,You better not hook up to the amplifier.
00:05:16.357,00:05:18.316,There’s a slight possibility of overload.
00:05:18.400,00:05:20.986,Yeah. I’ll keep that in mind.
00:05:21.070,00:05:23.447,Good. I’ll see you tonight. Don’t forget now.
00:05:23.531,00:05:26.450,"1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall."
00:05:33.666,00:05:35.667,Are those my clocks I hear?
00:05:35.751,00:05:38.211,"Uh, it’s 8:00."
00:05:38.295,00:05:40.380,Perfect! My experiment worked!
00:05:40.464,00:05:43.050,They’re all exactly 25 minutes slow!
00:05:44.051,00:05:46.511,"Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc."
00:05:46.595,00:05:48.930,Are you telling me that it’s 8:25?
00:05:49.014,00:05:50.390,Precisely.
00:05:50.474,00:05:53.352,Damn! I’m late for school.
00:06:53.412,00:06:56.248,"Yo, Jennifer."
00:06:56.332,00:06:59.001,"If you get caught, it’ll be four tardies in a row."
00:07:00.753,00:07:03.088,"All right, come on. I think we’re safe."
00:07:03.172,00:07:07.592,This time it wasn’t my fault. The doc set all his clocks 25 minutes slow.
00:07:07.676,00:07:12.764,"Doc? Am I to understand you’re still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?"
00:07:12.848,00:07:16.810,"Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker."
00:07:16.894,00:07:20.564,"And one for you, McFly. I believe that makes four in a row."
00:07:20.648,00:07:23.567,"Let me give you a nickel’s worth of free advice, young man."
00:07:23.651,00:07:26.903,This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He’s a real nutcase.
00:07:26.987,00:07:29.406,"Hang around with him, you’re gonna end up in big trouble."
00:07:29.490,00:07:31.408,"Oh, yes, sir."
00:07:31.492,00:07:34.786,"You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You’re a slacker."
00:07:34.870,00:07:39.374,You remind me of your father when he went here. He was a slacker too.
00:07:39.458,00:07:41.459,"Can I go now, Mr. Strickland?"
00:07:41.543,00:07:43.461,I notice your band is on the roster...
00:07:43.545,00:07:45.380,for the dance auditions after school today.
00:07:45.464,00:07:47.716,"Why even bother, McFly? You don’t have a chance."
00:07:47.800,00:07:49.801,You’re too much like your old man.
00:07:49.885,00:07:53.806,No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley.
00:07:55.724,00:07:58.018,"Yeah, well, history is gonna change."
00:08:00.145,00:08:01.522,"Next, please."
00:08:12.950,00:08:15.994,"We’re the, uh– We’re the Pinheads."
00:08:38.434,00:08:41.478,"Okay, that’s enough. Uh, thank you– Thank you, fellas."
00:08:41.562,00:08:43.688,"Hold it. Hold it, fellas."
00:08:43.772,00:08:46.108,I’m afraid you’re just too darn loud.
00:08:47.234,00:08:48.777,"Next, please."
00:08:51.363,00:08:53.532,"Next group, please."
00:08:58.412,00:09:00.372,Progress is his middle name.
00:09:02.624,00:09:05.126,We’ll never get a chance to play in front of anybody.
00:09:05.210,00:09:07.587,"Marty, one rejection isn’t the end of the world."
00:09:07.671,00:09:10.131,I just don’t think I’m cut out for music.
00:09:10.215,00:09:14.094,"But you’re good, Marty. You’re really good, and this audition tape of yours is great."
00:09:14.178,00:09:16.388,You’ve gotta send it in to the record company.
00:09:16.472,00:09:18.390,It’s like Doc’s always saying.
00:09:18.474,00:09:20.809,"If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything."
00:09:21.810,00:09:23.770,"That’s good advice, Marty."
00:09:23.854,00:09:27.524,"Okay, Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don’t like it?"
00:09:27.608,00:09:29.526,What if they say I’m no good?
00:09:29.610,00:09:31.903,"What if they say, Get outta here. You got no future?"
00:09:31.987,00:09:35.281,I don’t think I can take that kind of rejection.
00:09:35.365,00:09:37.325,Jesus. I’m starting to sound like my old man.
00:09:37.409,00:09:39.369,He’s not that bad.
00:09:39.453,00:09:41.789,At least he’s letting you borrow the car tomorrow night.
00:09:42.956,00:09:44.916,Check out that 4x4.
00:09:48.587,00:09:51.506,"Someday, Jennifer. Someday."
00:09:51.590,00:09:55.260,Wouldn’t it be great to take that truck up to the lake?
00:09:56.762,00:09:59.223,Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back.
00:10:01.308,00:10:03.268,Lie out underneath the stars.
00:10:03.352,00:10:05.937,Stop it.
00:10:06.021,00:10:08.565,Does your mom know? About tomorrow night?
00:10:08.649,00:10:12.652,"Nah, get outta town. My mom thinks I’m goin’ campin’ with the guys."
00:10:12.736,00:10:15.780,My mother would freak out if she knew I was goin’ up there with you.
00:10:15.864,00:10:17.824,I’d get the standard lecture...
00:10:17.908,00:10:20.493,about how she never did that stuff when she was a kid.
00:10:20.577,00:10:23.329,"I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun."
00:10:23.413,00:10:26.124,She’s just trying to keep you respectable.
00:10:26.208,00:10:28.376,"Well, she’s not doin’ a very good job."
00:10:28.460,00:10:31.296,Terrible.
00:10:31.380,00:10:33.423,Save the clock tower.
00:10:33.507,00:10:37.552,Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock.
00:10:37.636,00:10:42.307,"Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower, and the clock hasn’t run since."
00:10:42.391,00:10:44.267,We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society...
00:10:44.351,00:10:49.147,"think it should be preserved exactly the way it is, as part of our history and heritage."
00:10:49.231,00:10:50.899,There’s a quarter.
00:10:50.983,00:10:53.067,Don’t forget to take a flyer.
00:10:53.151,00:10:55.070,Save the clock tower!
00:10:56.905,00:10:59.491,Where were we?
00:11:05.914,00:11:09.375,I’ll call you tonight.
00:11:09.459,00:11:11.920,"Here, let me give you the number."
00:11:16.174,00:11:17.509,Bye.
00:12:04.181,00:12:06.642,"Tow for impoundment. Any unit, please respond."
00:12:09.645,00:12:12.773,Perfect. Just perfect.
00:12:18.737,00:12:20.864,I can’t believe you’d loan me your car...
00:12:20.948,00:12:23.241,without tellin’ me it had a blind spot.
00:12:20.948,00:12:24.868,Blind spot– I could’ve been killed.
00:12:24.952,00:12:27.370,"Now, Biff, I never noticed..."
00:12:27.454,00:12:31.249,that the car had any blind spot before when I would drive it.
00:12:31.333,00:12:33.334,"Hi, Son."
00:12:35.420,00:12:37.338,How else do you explain that wreck out there?
00:12:37.422,00:12:40.758,"Now, Biff, can I– can I assume..."
00:12:40.842,00:12:43.553,"that your, uh, insurance is gonna pay for the damage?"
00:12:43.637,00:12:45.972,My insurance? It’s your car.
00:12:46.056,00:12:48.975,Your insurance should pay for it. I wanna know who’s gonna pay for this.
00:12:49.059,00:12:52.103,I spilled beer when I was smashed into. Who’s gonna pay my cleaning bill?
00:12:55.190,00:13:03.031,"I haven’t finished those up yet, but I figured since they weren’t due till– Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh?"
00:13:03.115,00:13:05.575,"Think, McFly. Think!"
00:13:05.659,00:13:07.577,I gotta have time to get ’em retyped.
00:13:07.661,00:13:11.539,Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting?
00:13:11.623,00:13:13.541,I’ll get fired.
00:13:13.625,00:13:16.294,"You wouldn’t want that to happen, would ya?"
00:13:16.378,00:13:18.338,Would ya?
00:13:18.422,00:13:20.924,I wouldn’t want that to happen.
00:13:21.008,00:13:26.804,"Now, look. I’ll finish those reports tonight, and I’ll run ’em on over first thing tomorrow."
00:13:26.888,00:13:28.932,Not too early. I sleep in Saturday.
00:13:29.016,00:13:30.934,"McFly, your shoe’s untied."
00:13:31.018,00:13:33.645,"Don’t be so gullible, McFly."
00:13:33.729,00:13:35.731,Got the place fixed up nice.
00:13:37.858,00:13:42.279,"I have your car towed all the way to your house, and all you got for me is light beer?"
00:13:49.202,00:13:51.413,"What are you lookin’ at, butthead?"
00:13:53.957,00:13:55.959,Say hi to your mom for me.
00:13:58.795,00:14:02.590,"I know what you’re gonna say, Son. And you’re right."
00:14:02.674,00:14:04.676,You’re right.
00:14:04.760,00:14:13.435,"But, uh, Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I’m afraid I’m just not very good at confrontations."
00:14:14.561,00:14:16.605,"But the car, Dad."
00:14:17.773,00:14:20.192,"I mean, he wrecked it. He totaled it."
00:14:21.693,00:14:23.611,"I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad."
00:14:23.695,00:14:27.156,Do you have any idea how important this was to me? Do you have any clue?
00:14:27.240,00:14:31.911,"I know, and all I can say is I’m– I’m sorry."
00:14:31.995,00:14:34.372,"Believe me, Marty, you’re better off..."
00:14:34.456,00:14:37.375,without having to worry about all the aggravation...
00:14:37.459,00:14:40.878,and headaches of playing at that dance.
00:14:42.964,00:14:45.092,The last thing you need is headaches.
00:14:52.891,00:14:56.769,"Kids, we’re gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves."
00:14:56.853,00:14:59.230,Your Uncle Joey didn’t make parole again.
00:15:01.399,00:15:05.361,It would be nice if you all dropped him a line.
00:15:09.157,00:15:12.994,"Yeah. It’s a major embarrassment, having an uncle in prison."
00:15:13.078,00:15:15.246,"We all make mistakes in life, children."
00:15:15.330,00:15:18.583,Goddamn it. I’m late.
00:15:18.667,00:15:21.252,You come here and kiss your mother before you go.
00:15:21.336,00:15:24.422,"Come on, Mom. Make it fast. I’ll miss my bus."
00:15:24.506,00:15:26.382,"See you later, Pop."
00:15:26.466,00:15:29.177,Whoo! Time to change that oil.
00:15:29.261,00:15:32.180,Oh. Ha-ha-ha. Change the oil.
00:15:32.264,00:15:35.808,"Hey, Marty. I’m not your answering service."
00:15:35.892,00:15:40.146,"While you were outside pouting over the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice."
00:15:40.230,00:15:45.151,I don’t like her. Any girl who calls up a boy is just asking for trouble.
00:15:45.235,00:15:48.112,"Oh, Mother, there’s nothing wrong with calling a boy."
00:15:48.196,00:15:52.241,I think it’s terrible. Girls chasing boys!
00:15:52.325,00:15:55.453,"When I was your age, I never chased a boy or called a boy..."
00:15:55.537,00:15:58.664,or sat in a parked car with a boy.
00:15:58.748,00:16:02.543,Then how am I ever supposed to meet anybody?
00:16:02.627,00:16:04.962,"Well, it’ll just happen."
00:16:05.046,00:16:07.340,Like the way I met your father.
00:16:07.424,00:16:10.134,That was so stupid. Grandpa hit him with the car.
00:16:10.218,00:16:12.136,It was meant to be.
00:16:12.220,00:16:18.601,"Anyway, if Grandpa hadn’t hit him, then none of you would have been born."
00:16:18.685,00:16:20.603,"Yeah, well."
00:16:20.687,00:16:23.981,I still don’t understand what Dad was doin’ in the middle of the street.
00:16:24.065,00:16:26.442,"What was it, George? Bird-watching?"
00:16:26.526,00:16:29.070,"What, Lorraine? What?"
00:16:29.154,00:16:32.115,"Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car..."
00:16:32.199,00:16:34.159,and brought him into the house.
00:16:35.243,00:16:37.204,He seemed so helpless.
00:16:39.664,00:16:42.875,"Like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him."
00:16:42.959,00:16:47.296,"Yeah, Mom, we know. You’ve told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him."
00:16:47.380,00:16:50.716,So you decided to go with him to the Fish Under the Sea dance.
00:16:50.800,00:16:54.595,No. It was the Enchantment Under the Sea dance.
00:16:54.679,00:16:57.974,Our first date. I’ll never forget it.
00:16:58.058,00:17:00.768,"It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember, George?"
00:17:03.772,00:17:08.443,Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor.
00:17:10.612,00:17:12.780,It was then that I realized...
00:17:12.864,00:17:15.366,that I was gonna spend the rest of my life with him.
00:17:19.871,00:17:22.748,"Oh, no! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha."
00:17:47.691,00:17:50.651,"Ah, Doc. Uh, no."
00:17:50.735,00:17:52.820,"No, don’t be silly."
00:17:52.904,00:17:55.323,"Listen, this is very important. I forgot my video camera."
00:17:55.407,00:17:58.618,Can you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall?
00:17:58.702,00:18:01.329,"Uh, yeah. I’m on my way."
00:18:25.645,00:18:29.649,"Einstein! Hey, Einstein, where’s the doc, boy?"
00:19:23.161,00:19:25.454,Doc!
00:19:25.538,00:19:27.498,Marty! You made it!
00:19:27.582,00:19:29.750,Welcome to my latest experiment. This is the big one.
00:19:29.834,00:19:32.003,The one I’ve been waiting for all my life.
00:19:32.087,00:19:33.921,"Uh, well, it’s a DeLorean."
00:19:34.005,00:19:37.591,"All your questions will be answered. Roll tape, and we’ll proceed."
00:19:37.675,00:19:40.594,Is that a Devo suit?
00:19:40.678,00:19:42.346,Not now.
00:19:42.430,00:19:44.682,Good evening. I’m Dr. Emmett Brown.
00:19:44.766,00:19:47.351,I’m in the parking lot at Twin Pines Mall.
00:19:47.435,00:19:50.730,"It’s Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m."
00:19:50.814,00:19:53.190,This is temporal experiment number one.
00:19:53.274,00:19:55.735,"Come on, Einie. Hey, boy. Get in there."
00:19:55.819,00:19:58.237,Attaboy. In you go. Sit down.
00:19:58.321,00:20:00.281,Put your seat belt on. That’s it.
00:20:05.453,00:20:07.455,"Whoa, whoa. Okay."
00:20:09.457,00:20:11.709,Please note that Einstein’s clock...
00:20:11.793,00:20:14.754,is in precise synchronization with my control watch.
00:20:14.838,00:20:16.505,"- Got it? - Right. Check, Doc."
00:20:16.589,00:20:18.091,Good.
00:20:19.884,00:20:22.303,"Have a good trip, Einstein. Watch your head."
00:20:28.059,00:20:31.020,You got that thing hooked up to the car?
00:20:31.104,00:20:33.230,Watch this.
00:20:33.314,00:20:35.316,Got it.
00:20:38.319,00:20:39.946,Jesus.
00:20:44.659,00:20:46.244,Not me! The car!
00:21:04.012,00:21:11.686,"If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you’re gonna see some serious shit."
00:21:47.055,00:21:50.058,Watch this! Watch this!
00:22:06.616,00:22:08.993,Ah! What did I tell you?
00:22:10.036,00:22:13.248,Eighty-eight miles per hour!
00:22:15.750,00:22:21.256,The temporal displacement occurred exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds!
00:22:23.091,00:22:25.134,"Ah, Jesus Christ!"
00:22:25.218,00:22:27.595,"Jesus Christ, Doc! You disintegrated Einstein!"
00:22:27.679,00:22:30.097,"Calm down, Marty. I didn’t disintegrate anything."
00:22:30.181,00:22:35.102,The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.
00:22:35.186,00:22:39.565,"Then where the hell are they? The appropriate question is, When the hell are they?"
00:22:39.649,00:22:44.612,"You see, Einstein has just become the world’s first time traveler!"
00:22:44.696,00:22:48.365,I sent him into the future!
00:22:48.449,00:22:50.868,"One minute into the future, to be exact."
00:22:50.952,00:22:56.499,"At precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine."
00:23:00.461,00:23:06.968,"Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Uh– Are you telling me that you built a time machine..."
00:23:08.052,00:23:09.970,out of a DeLorean?
00:23:10.054,00:23:14.475,"If you’re gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?"
00:23:14.559,00:24:07.319,"Besides, the stainless steel construction made the flux dispersal– What? What? Is it hot?"
00:24:07.403,00:24:09.530,Damn cold.
00:24:11.032,00:24:14.202,"Ah, ha-ha! Einstein, you little devil!"
00:24:16.079,00:24:19.957,Einstein’s clock is exactly one minute behind mine and still ticking!
00:24:23.252,00:24:25.671,He’s all right.
00:24:25.755,00:24:28.090,He’s completely unaware that anything happened.
00:24:28.174,00:24:30.843,"As far as he’s concerned, the trip was instantaneous."
00:24:30.927,00:24:33.345,That’s why his watch is exactly one minute behind mine.
00:24:33.429,00:24:36.557,He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time.
00:24:36.641,00:24:39.060,Come here. I’ll show you how it works.
00:24:41.354,00:24:44.524,"First, you turn the time circuits on."
00:24:47.819,00:24:52.573,"This readout tells you where you’re going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were."
00:24:52.657,00:24:54.658,You input your destination time on this keypad.
00:24:54.742,00:24:57.578,Say you wanna see the signing of the Declaration of Independence.
00:25:00.915,00:25:03.084,Or witness the birth of Christ.
00:25:05.461,00:25:08.297,Here’s a red-letter date in the history of science.
00:25:08.381,00:25:11.134,"November 5, 1955."
00:25:14.804,00:25:19.016,"Yes, of course. November 5, 1955."
00:25:20.101,00:25:22.895,What happened?
00:25:22.979,00:25:25.022,That was the day I invented time travel.
00:25:25.106,00:25:29.360,"I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet, hanging a clock."
00:25:29.444,00:25:32.363,"The porcelain was wet. I slipped, hit my head on the sink."
00:25:32.447,00:25:34.406,"When I came to, I had a revelation."
00:25:34.490,00:25:37.701,A vision. A picture in my head. A picture of this.
00:25:37.785,00:25:41.288,This is what makes time travel possible.
00:25:41.372,00:25:43.207,The flux capacitor.
00:25:43.291,00:25:47.544,Flux capacitor?
00:25:47.628,00:25:49.922,to realize the vision of that day.
00:25:50.006,00:25:52.883,"My God, has it been that long?"
00:25:52.967,00:25:54.969,Things have certainly changed around here.
00:25:56.929,00:26:00.725,I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see.
00:26:02.226,00:26:05.896,Old man Peabody owned all of this.
00:26:05.980,00:26:09.901,He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.
00:26:13.654,00:26:16.198,"This is, uh– This is heavy-duty, Doc."
00:26:16.282,00:26:20.285,This is great. Does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?
00:26:20.369,00:26:24.081,"Unfortunately, no. I requires something with a little more kick. Plutonium."
00:26:24.165,00:26:28.919,"Uh, plutonium. Wait a minute. Are you– Are you tellin’ me that this sucker is nuclear?"
00:26:29.003,00:26:31.213,"Hey, hey, hey. Keep rolling there."
00:26:31.297,00:26:34.508,"No, this sucker’s electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate..."
00:26:34.592,00:26:36.635,the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.
00:26:36.719,00:26:40.180,You don’t just walk into a store and buy plutonium.
00:26:40.264,00:26:43.059,Did you rip that off?
00:26:44.685,00:26:46.603,Of course. From a group of Libyan nationalists.
00:26:46.687,00:26:48.605,They wanted me to build them a bomb.
00:26:48.689,00:26:52.943,So I took their plutonium and gave them a bomb casing full of used pinball machine parts.
00:26:53.027,00:26:54.862,Come on! Let’s get you a radiation suit.
00:26:54.946,00:26:56.447,We must prepare to reload.
00:27:25.726,00:27:27.687,It’s safe now. Everything’s lead-lined.
00:27:30.106,00:27:32.149,Don’t you lose those tapes now.
00:27:32.233,00:27:34.193,I need that as a record.
00:27:34.277,00:27:36.279,Let’s put this back here. There we go.
00:27:38.072,00:27:40.741,Whoop! Almost forgot my luggage.
00:27:40.825,00:27:43.494,Who knows if they’ve got cotton underwear in the future.
00:27:43.578,00:27:46.455,I’m allergic to all synthetics.
00:27:46.539,00:27:48.499,That’s where you’re goin’.
00:27:48.583,00:27:50.459,Twenty-five years into the future.
00:27:50.543,00:27:55.506,"I’ve always dreamed of seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind."
00:27:55.590,00:27:57.925,Why not?
00:27:58.009,00:28:00.886,the next 25 World Series.
00:28:00.970,00:28:02.513,"Uh, Doc."
00:28:02.597,00:28:06.475,"Uh, look me up when you get there."
00:28:06.559,00:28:08.603,Indeed I will. Roll ’em.
00:28:12.273,00:28:13.774,Ahem!
00:28:15.443,00:28:21.991,"I, Dr. Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey."
00:28:24.285,00:28:26.203,What am I thinking of?
00:28:26.287,00:28:28.539,I almost forgot to bring extra plutonium.
00:28:28.623,00:28:31.041,"How do I expect to get back? One pellet, one trip."
00:28:31.125,00:28:33.544,I must be out of my mind.
00:28:45.932,00:28:49.476,"Oh, my God. They found me. I don’t know how, but they found me."
00:28:49.560,00:28:52.479,"- Run for it, Marty! - Who? Who?"
00:28:52.563,00:28:56.233,Who do you think? The Libyans!
00:28:58.486,00:29:00.071,Holy shit!
00:29:13.751,00:29:14.961,"Doc, wait!"
00:29:29.183,00:29:31.101,No!
00:29:31.185,00:29:33.020,You bastard!
00:29:53.541,00:29:55.543,Damn it! Stupid gun!
00:29:59.380,00:30:00.673,Go!
00:30:41.464,00:30:44.050,Come on! Move! Damn it!
00:31:06.447,00:31:08.991,Holy shit!
00:31:09.075,00:31:11.911,Let’s see if you bastards can do 90.
00:32:06.757,00:32:10.427,Looks like an airplane... without wings.
00:32:10.511,00:32:14.014,That ain’t no airplane. Look.
00:32:49.758,00:32:51.719,Hello?
00:32:52.761,00:32:54.847,"Uh, excuse me."
00:32:58.309,00:33:00.227,Sorry about your barn.
00:33:04.064,00:33:07.318,It’s already mutated into human form! Shoot it!
00:33:08.986,00:33:11.363,"Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!"
00:33:19.121,00:33:21.207,"Shoot it, Pa!"
00:33:24.418,00:33:40.809,"My pine! Why, you– Okay, McFly. Get a grip on yourself. It’s all a dream."
00:33:40.893,00:33:43.479,Just a very intense dream.
00:34:25.062,00:34:27.564,"Whoa! Listen, you gotta help me."
00:34:27.648,00:34:30.484,"Don’t stop, Wilbur! Drive!"
00:34:31.777,00:34:33.279,Can’t be.
00:34:39.493,00:34:41.453,This is nuts.
00:34:45.499,00:34:47.918,"Oh, come on."
00:34:48.002,00:34:50.671,Perfect.
00:36:48.288,00:36:51.708,"If you believe in progress, reelect Mayor Red Thomas."
00:36:51.792,00:36:54.252,Progress is his middle name.
00:36:54.336,00:36:56.796,Mayor Red Thomas’s progress platform...
00:36:56.880,00:37:02.719,"means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements and lower taxes."
00:37:02.803,00:37:06.181,"On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader."
00:37:06.265,00:37:08.142,Reelect Mayor Red Thomas.
00:37:12.020,00:37:14.106,This has gotta be a dream.
00:37:33.709,00:37:36.837,- What? - What’s with the life preserver?
00:37:40.966,00:37:42.968,I just wanna use the phone.
00:37:44.011,00:37:46.013,"Yeah, it’s in the back."
00:37:48.348,00:37:50.267,Brown.
00:37:51.602,00:37:54.354,Great. You’re alive.
00:38:05.240,00:38:07.284,Come on.
00:38:14.124,00:38:18.170,"Do you know where 1640 Riverside– Are you gonna order somethin’, kid?"
00:38:19.880,00:38:23.633,"Uh, yeah. Gimme– Gimme a Tab."
00:38:23.717,00:38:26.136,Tab? I can’t give you a tab unless you order somethin’.
00:38:26.220,00:38:28.138,Right. Give me a Pepsi Free.
00:38:28.222,00:38:31.141,"If you want a Pepsi, pal, you’re gonna pay for it."
00:38:31.225,00:38:34.310,"Just give me something without any sugar in it, okay?"
00:38:34.394,00:38:36.396,Somethin’ without sugar.
00:38:43.862,00:38:45.906,"Hey, McFly."
00:38:47.449,00:38:50.160,What do you think you’re doin’?
00:38:50.244,00:38:54.038,"- Biff. - I’m talkin’ to you, McFly, you Irish bug!"
00:38:54.122,00:38:57.750,"- Oh, hey, Biff. Hey, guys. How are you doin’? - You got my homework finished?"
00:38:57.834,00:39:05.925,"Well, actually, I figured since it wasn’t due till Monday– Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Hey, think, McFly."
00:39:06.009,00:39:08.720,Think. I gotta have time to recopy it.
00:39:08.804,00:39:12.182,You realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting?
00:39:12.266,00:39:14.184,I’ll get kicked outta school.
00:39:14.268,00:39:16.603,"You wouldn’t want that to happen, would ya?"
00:39:19.314,00:39:21.232,Would ya? No.
00:39:21.316,00:39:23.234,I wouldn’t want that to happen.
00:39:23.318,00:39:25.236,"What are you lookin’ at, butthead?"
00:39:25.320,00:39:28.781,Get a load of this guy’s life preserver. Dork thinks he’s gonna drown.
00:39:28.865,00:39:30.825,"How ’bout my homework, McFly?"
00:39:30.909,00:39:32.827,"Uh, okay, Biff."
00:39:32.911,00:39:38.124,"Well, I’ll, uh– I’ll finish that on up tonight, and then I’ll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning."
00:39:38.208,00:39:41.544,Not too early. I sleep in Sundays. Your shoe’s untied!
00:39:41.628,00:39:44.714,"Don’t be so gullible, McFly."
00:39:44.798,00:39:48.051,I don’t wanna see you in here again.
00:40:10.407,00:40:13.159,- What? - You’re George McFly!
00:40:13.243,00:40:15.161,Yeah. Who are you?
00:40:15.245,00:40:18.081,What do you let those boys push you around like that for?
00:40:18.165,00:40:20.083,"They’re bigger than me. Stand tall, boy!"
00:40:20.167,00:40:22.085,Have some respect for yourself.
00:40:22.169,00:40:26.923,"Don’t you know if you let people walk over you now, they’ll walk over you for the rest of your life."
00:40:27.007,00:40:30.009,Look at me. You think I’m gonna spend my life in this slop house?
00:40:30.093,00:40:32.178,"No, sir!"
00:40:32.262,00:40:35.014,I’m gonna make somethin’ of myself. I’m goin’ to night school.
00:40:35.098,00:40:38.476,"-One day, I’m gonna be somebody. -That’s right. He’s gonna be mayor."
00:40:38.560,00:40:42.438,"Yeah, I’m– Mayor!"
00:40:42.522,00:40:46.484,Now that’s a good idea. I could run for mayor.
00:40:46.568,00:40:48.570,A colored mayor. That’ll be the day.
00:40:48.654,00:40:51.030,"Wait and see, Mr. Carruthers. I will be mayor."
00:40:51.114,00:40:55.285,"I’ll be the most powerful man in Hill Valley, and I’m gonna clean up this town."
00:40:55.369,00:40:57.412,Good. You can start by sweeping the floor.
00:40:58.497,00:40:59.831,Hmph.
00:41:00.832,00:41:03.042,Mayor Goldie Wilson.
00:41:03.126,00:41:05.796,I like the sound of that. Mmm!
00:41:17.557,00:41:20.894,"Hey, Dad– George! Hey, you on the bike!"
00:41:52.259,00:41:54.261,He’s a Peeping Tom!
00:42:12.779,00:42:16.074,"Hey, wait– Wait a minute. Who are you?"
00:42:17.784,00:42:22.038,Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car!
00:42:22.122,00:42:25.125,Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!
00:42:31.214,00:42:32.799,Mom?
00:42:34.885,00:42:37.888,"There, there, now. Just relax."
00:42:40.474,00:42:42.934,You’ve been asleep for almost nine hours now.
00:42:45.312,00:42:47.773,I had a... horrible nightmare.
00:42:48.857,00:42:51.984,I dreamed that I went back in time.
00:42:52.068,00:42:54.445,It was terrible.
00:42:54.529,00:42:59.659,"Well, you’re safe and sound now, back in good old 1955."
00:43:07.167,00:43:11.338,You’re my mo– You’re my mo– My name is Lorraine.
00:43:12.672,00:43:14.841,Lorraine Baines?
00:43:15.842,00:43:22.306,"But you’re, uh– You’re so, uh– You’re so... thin!"
00:43:22.390,00:43:25.519,"Just relax, Calvin. You got a big bruise on your head."
00:43:28.897,00:43:31.483,Ah! Where are my pants?
00:43:32.400,00:43:35.320,Over there... on my hope chest.
00:43:37.405,00:43:40.158,"I’ve never seen purple underwear before, Calvin."
00:43:40.242,00:43:43.619,Calvin? Why– Why do you keep calling me Calvin?
00:43:43.703,00:43:47.081,"That is your name, isn’t it? Calvin Klein?"
00:43:47.165,00:43:49.209,It’s written all over your underwear.
00:43:50.377,00:43:52.795,"I guess they call you Cal, huh?"
00:43:52.879,00:43:56.632,"No, actually, people... call me Marty."
00:43:56.716,00:43:58.634,Oh.
00:43:58.718,00:44:03.723,"Pleased to meet you, Calvin– Marty..."
00:44:04.808,00:44:06.810,Klein.
00:44:12.566,00:44:15.318,Do you mind if I sit here?
00:44:15.402,00:44:18.655,Fine. No. Good. Fine. Good.
00:44:19.990,00:44:22.784,That’s a big bruise you have there.
00:44:22.868,00:44:24.786,Aaah!
00:44:26.955,00:44:28.873,"Oh, my God! It’s my mother!"
00:44:28.957,00:44:31.960,Quick! Put your pants back on.
00:44:40.093,00:44:43.012,"Tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port?"
00:44:43.096,00:44:45.014,Excuse me?
00:44:45.098,00:44:47.141,That’s why you wear that life preserver.
00:44:47.225,00:44:49.143,"Uh, Coast Guard."
00:44:49.227,00:44:53.689,"Sam, here’s the young man you hit with your car. He’s all right. Thank God."
00:44:53.773,00:44:55.775,What were you doin’ in the middle of the street?
00:44:55.859,00:44:58.611,Don’t pay attention to him. He’s in one of his moods.
00:44:58.695,00:45:01.280,Quit fiddling with that thing. Come in here to dinner.
00:45:01.364,00:45:03.491,Let’s see. You already know Lorraine.
00:45:03.575,00:45:10.123,"This is Milton, this is Sally, that’s Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey."
00:45:11.833,00:45:14.710,So you’re my Uncle Joey.
00:45:14.794,00:45:17.588,"Better get used to these bars, kid."
00:45:17.672,00:45:21.884,Yes. Joey just loves being in his playpen.
00:45:21.968,00:45:25.555,"He cries whenever we take him out, so we leave him in there all the time."
00:45:25.639,00:45:27.890,"Well, Marty, I hope you like meat loaf."
00:45:27.974,00:45:32.019,"Well, listen, I really oughta– Sit here, Marty."
00:45:32.103,00:45:36.566,"Sam, stop fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner."
00:45:40.028,00:45:42.071,Now we can watch Jackie Gleason while we eat.
00:45:50.830,00:45:54.334,Our first television set. Dad just picked it up today.
00:45:55.502,00:45:57.545,Do you have a television?
00:45:57.629,00:46:00.298,"Well, yeah, ya know, we have... two of ’em."
00:46:00.382,00:46:03.092,Wow! You must be rich.
00:46:03.176,00:46:07.638,"Oh, honey, he’s teasing you. Nobody has two television sets."
00:46:11.935,00:46:16.397,"Hey– Hey, I’ve seen this one. This is a classic."
00:46:16.481,00:46:19.275,This is where Ralph dresses up as a man from space.
00:46:19.359,00:46:23.029,What do you mean you’ve seen this? It’s brand-new.
00:46:23.113,00:46:25.781,"Yeah, well, I saw it on a... rerun."
00:46:25.865,00:46:29.619,- What’s a rerun? - You’ll find out.
00:46:29.703,00:46:32.455,"You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me."
00:46:32.539,00:46:34.499,Do I know your mother?
00:46:35.542,00:46:37.543,"Yeah, I think maybe you do."
00:46:37.627,00:46:41.088,Then I wanna give her a call. I don’t want her to worry about you.
00:46:41.172,00:46:46.720,"You can’t. Uh– That is, uh, nobody– nobody’s home."
00:46:47.804,00:46:50.306,- Oh. - Yet.
00:46:50.390,00:46:52.475,Oh.
00:46:52.559,00:46:55.853,"Uh, listen. Do you know where Riverside Drive is?"
00:46:55.937,00:46:59.065,It’s on the other end of town. A block past Maple.
00:46:59.149,00:47:01.108,East end of town.
00:47:01.192,00:47:03.987,A block past Maple. That’s John F. Kennedy Drive.
00:47:05.739,00:47:07.657,Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?
00:47:09.743,00:47:15.456,"With Marty’s parents out of town, don’t you think he oughta spend the night?"
00:47:15.540,00:47:18.000,"After all, Dad almost killed him with the car."
00:47:18.084,00:47:19.961,"That’s true, Marty."
00:47:20.045,00:47:23.339,I think you should spend the night. I think you’re our responsibility.
00:47:23.423,00:47:28.010,"Well, gee, I don’t know."
00:47:28.094,00:47:30.179,I gotta go! I gotta go. Thanks very much.
00:47:30.263,00:47:32.932,It was wonderful. You were all great. See you all later.
00:47:34.476,00:47:36.436,Much later.
00:47:40.023,00:47:42.233,He’s a very strange young man.
00:47:42.317,00:47:44.068,He’s an idiot.
00:47:44.152,00:47:48.030,Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots too.
00:47:48.114,00:47:51.951,"Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I’ll disown you."
00:48:30.198,00:48:32.116,Doc?
00:48:32.200,00:48:34.660,Don’t say a word.
00:48:34.744,00:48:37.246,I don’t wanna know anything about you.
00:48:37.330,00:48:39.248,"Listen, Doc– Doc– Quiet!"
00:48:39.332,00:48:42.585,Don’t tell me anything. Quiet.
00:48:39.332,00:48:48.424,You gotta help– I’m gonna read your thoughts. Let’s see now.
00:48:48.508,00:48:51.385,You come here from a great distance?
00:48:51.469,00:48:53.929,Yeah! Exactly.
00:48:54.013,00:48:57.016,You want me to buy a subscription to The Saturday Evening Post?
00:48:57.100,00:48:59.685,- No! - Not a word! Not a word now!
00:48:59.769,00:49:01.687,Quiet.
00:49:01.771,00:49:04.774,Uh... donations.
00:49:04.858,00:49:06.942,You want me to make a donation...
00:49:07.026,00:49:09.278,to the Coast Guard Youth Auxiliary.
00:49:09.362,00:49:14.992,"Doc, I’m from the future."
00:49:15.076,00:49:18.120,I came here in a time machine that you invented.
00:49:18.204,00:49:21.040,"Now, I need your help to get back to the year..."
00:49:21.124,00:49:23.710,1985.
00:49:24.794,00:49:26.796,By God.
00:49:30.758,00:49:33.011,Do you know what this means?
00:49:34.888,00:49:38.724,It means that this damn thing doesn’t work at all!
00:49:38.808,00:49:43.187,"Doc, you gotta help me. You are the only one who knows how your time machine works."
00:49:43.271,00:49:45.439,Time machine.
00:49:45.523,00:49:47.442,I haven’t invented any time machine.
00:49:49.235,00:49:51.654,Okay. All right. I’ll prove it to you.
00:49:51.738,00:49:54.949,Look at my driver’s license. Expires 1987.
00:49:55.033,00:49:58.619,Look at my birthday. I haven’t even been born yet.
00:49:58.703,00:50:00.788,And look at this picture.
00:50:00.872,00:50:03.082,"It’s my brother, my sister and me."
00:50:03.166,00:50:07.336,"Look at her sweatshirt, Doc. Class of 1984?"
00:50:07.420,00:50:11.924,Pretty mediocre photographic fakery. They cut off your brother’s hair.
00:50:12.008,00:50:14.677,I’m tellin’ the truth. You gotta believe me.
00:50:14.761,00:50:22.101,"Then tell me, future boy, who’s president of the United States in 1985?"
00:50:22.185,00:50:26.272,Ronald Reagan.
00:50:27.315,00:50:29.776,Then who’s vice president? Jerry Lewis?
00:50:30.944,00:50:33.696,I suppose Jane Wyman is the first lady!
00:50:33.780,00:50:37.032,"Wait, Doc!"
00:50:37.116,00:50:40.619,You gotta listen to me.
00:50:40.703,00:50:43.164,"Good night, future boy!"
00:50:43.248,00:50:47.585,Th-The bruise on your head. I know how that happened. You told me the whole story.
00:50:47.669,00:50:59.514,"You were standing on your toilet, hanging a clock, and you fell and hit your head on the sink, and that’s when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which is what makes time travel possible."
00:51:12.652,00:51:16.990,"There’s something wrong with the starter, so I hid it... here."
00:51:27.375,00:51:32.422,"After I fell off my toilet, I drew this."
00:51:35.675,00:51:37.176,Flux capacitor.
00:51:59.198,00:52:01.117,It works!
00:52:02.201,00:52:05.246,I finally invent something that works!
00:52:05.330,00:52:08.415,You bet your ass it works.
00:52:08.499,00:52:11.460,Somehow we’ve gotta sneak this back to my laboratory.
00:52:11.544,00:52:13.504,We’ve gotta get you home!
00:52:13.588,00:52:15.673,"Okay, Doc, this is it."
00:52:17.800,00:52:20.052,Never mind that. Never mind that now.
00:52:20.136,00:52:22.554,"Why, that’s me! Look at me!"
00:52:22.638,00:52:24.640,I’m an old man! I’m Dr. Emmett Brown.
00:52:24.724,00:52:28.978,"I’m in the parking lot at Twin Pines– Thank God, I’ve still got my hair."
00:52:29.062,00:52:31.021,What’s on earth’s this thing I’m wearing?
00:52:31.105,00:52:33.274,This is a radiation suit.
00:52:33.358,00:52:35.276,Radiation suit?
00:52:35.360,00:52:38.780,Of course. Because of all the fallout from the atomic wars.
00:52:39.864,00:52:42.741,This... is truly amazing.
00:52:42.825,00:52:45.411,A portable television studio.
00:52:45.495,00:52:49.415,No wonder your president has to be an actor. He’s got to look good on television.
00:52:49.499,00:52:51.917,"Whoa. This is the part comin’ up, Doc."
00:52:52.001,00:52:59.175,"No, no, no, no, this sucker’s electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts– What did I just say?"
00:53:02.929,00:53:05.472,"...this sucker’s electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction..."
00:53:05.556,00:53:09.602,to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity– 1.21 gigawatts!
00:53:11.145,00:53:13.272,1.21 gigawatts.
00:53:15.358,00:53:17.276,Great Scott!
00:53:17.360,00:53:21.864,What– What the hell is a gigawatt?
00:53:21.948,00:53:24.408,How could I have been so careless?
00:53:24.492,00:53:26.493,1.21 gigawatts!
00:53:26.577,00:53:31.040,"Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power? It can’t be done, can it?"
00:53:31.124,00:53:34.168,"Doc, look. All we need is a little plutonium."
00:53:34.252,00:53:41.633,"Oh! I’m sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it’s a little hard to come by."
00:53:41.717,00:53:45.512,"Marty, I’m sorry, but I’m afraid you’re stuck here."
00:53:45.596,00:53:48.390,"Whoa, Doc, stuck here? I can’t be stuck here."
00:53:48.474,00:53:50.893,I got a life in 1985.
00:53:50.977,00:53:52.895,I got a girl.
00:53:52.979,00:53:58.067,"Doc, she’s beautiful. She– She’s crazy about me. Look at this."
00:53:58.151,00:54:00.194,"Look what she wrote here, Doc."
00:54:00.278,00:54:02.571,"I mean, that says it all."
00:54:02.655,00:54:06.075,"Doc, you’re my only hope."
00:54:06.159,00:54:09.787,"Marty, I’m sorry, but the only power source capable of generating..."
00:54:09.871,00:54:12.957,1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.
00:54:14.625,00:54:16.960,What did you say?
00:54:17.044,00:54:20.381,"Unfortunately, you never know when or where it’s ever gonna strike."
00:54:22.675,00:54:25.011,We do now.
00:54:29.140,00:54:31.100,This is it!
00:54:31.184,00:54:33.394,This is the answer.
00:54:33.478,00:54:35.854,It says here that a bolt of lightning...
00:54:35.938,00:54:41.194,is gonna strike the clock tower at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night!
00:54:44.030,00:54:54.623,"If we could somehow harness this lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work."
00:54:54.707,00:55:00.212,"Next Saturday night, we’re sending you back to the future!"
00:55:00.296,00:55:02.464,Okay. All right. Saturday’s good. Saturday’s good.
00:55:02.548,00:55:05.884,I can spend a week in 1955. I can hang out. You can show me around.
00:55:05.968,00:55:09.346,"Marty, that is completely out of the question. You must not leave this house."
00:55:09.430,00:55:11.515,You must not see anybody or talk to anybody.
00:55:11.599,00:55:14.059,Anything you do can have serious repercussions on future events.
00:55:14.143,00:55:16.562,Do you understand?
00:55:16.646,00:55:19.481,Yeah. Sure. Okay.
00:55:19.565,00:55:24.486,Have you interacted with anybody else today besides me?
00:55:24.570,00:55:29.241,"I’m– Yeah, well, I might’ve sort of bumped into my parents."
00:55:29.325,00:55:31.243,Great Scott!
00:55:31.327,00:55:33.496,Let me see that photograph again of your brother.
00:55:36.791,00:55:39.835,Just as I thought. This proves my theory. Look at your brother.
00:55:46.384,00:55:48.427,Erased from existence.
00:55:52.848,00:55:56.935,Whoa! They really cleaned this place up. Looks brand-new.
00:55:57.019,00:56:00.606,"Remember, according to my theory, you interfered with your parents’ first meeting."
00:56:00.690,00:56:03.525,"If they don’t meet, they won’t fall in love, get married and have kids."
00:56:03.609,00:56:06.236,That’s why your older brother’s disappearing from that photograph.
00:56:06.320,00:56:09.448,"Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you’ll be next."
00:56:09.532,00:56:12.701,Sounds pretty heavy.
00:56:12.785,00:56:14.870,Which one’s your pop?
00:56:15.871,00:56:17.581,That’s him.
00:56:17.665,00:56:19.875,"Okay. Okay, you guys."
00:56:19.959,00:56:24.213,"Ha, ha, ha, ha. Very funny. You guys are being real mature."
00:56:24.297,00:56:26.882,Maybe you were adopted.
00:56:26.966,00:56:29.468,"Okay, real mature, guys."
00:56:30.636,00:56:33.388,"Okay, pick up my books."
00:56:33.472,00:56:37.226,"That’s Strickland. Jesus, didn’t that guy ever have hair?"
00:56:37.310,00:56:40.187,"Shape up, man. You’re a slacker."
00:56:40.271,00:56:44.566,Do you wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? No.
00:56:44.650,00:56:47.402,What did your mother ever see in that kid?
00:56:47.486,00:56:52.115,I guess she felt sorry for him ’cause her dad hit him with the car.
00:56:52.199,00:56:54.701,He hit me with the car.
00:56:54.785,00:56:56.703,That’s the Florence Nightingale effect.
00:56:56.787,00:56:59.498,It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients.
00:56:59.582,00:57:01.167,"Go to it, kid."
00:57:02.418,00:57:05.504,"Hey, George, buddy."
00:57:05.588,00:57:07.965,I have been lookin’ all over for you.
00:57:08.049,00:57:11.176,"You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day?"
00:57:11.260,00:57:13.178,Oh. Yeah.
00:57:13.262,00:57:15.264,Good. There’s somebody I’d like you to meet.
00:57:19.602,00:57:21.520,Lorraine?
00:57:21.604,00:57:23.772,Calvin!
00:57:23.856,00:57:27.067,I’d like you to meet my good friend George McFly.
00:57:27.151,00:57:30.071,Hi. It’s really a pleasure to meet you.
00:57:31.155,00:57:33.740,How’s your head?
00:57:33.824,00:57:37.494,I’ve been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night.
00:57:37.578,00:57:39.580,Are you okay?
00:57:39.664,00:57:41.790,Come on. We’re tardy!
00:57:41.874,00:57:43.209,Come on!
00:57:43.959,00:57:45.795,Isn’t he a dreamboat?
00:57:50.132,00:57:53.051,She didn’t even look at him.
00:57:53.135,00:57:55.053,"Apparently, your mother is amorously infatuated with you..."
00:57:55.137,00:57:57.389,instead of your father.
00:57:57.473,00:58:02.311,"Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?"
00:58:02.395,00:58:05.063,Precisely.
00:58:05.147,00:58:08.692,There’s that word again: heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future?
00:58:08.776,00:58:11.278,Is there a problem with the Earth’s gravitational pull?
00:58:11.362,00:58:13.655,What?
00:58:13.739,00:58:15.490,is if they are alone together.
00:58:15.574,00:58:17.784,You’ve gotta get your father and mother to interact...
00:58:23.082,00:58:25.125,Right.
00:58:25.209,00:58:27.419,What do kids do in the ’50s?
00:58:27.503,00:58:29.630,They’re your parents. You must know them.
00:58:29.714,00:58:32.550,What are their common interests? What do they like to do together?
00:58:34.093,00:58:36.094,Nothing.
00:58:36.178,00:58:38.180,There’s a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.
00:58:38.264,00:58:40.307,Of course! The Enchantment Under the Sea dance!
00:58:40.391,00:58:43.769,They’re supposed to go to this. That’s where they kiss for the first time.
00:58:43.853,00:58:46.396,"All right, kid. You stick to your father like glue..."
00:58:46.480,00:58:48.357,and make sure he takes her to that dance.
00:58:48.441,00:58:51.151,"George, buddy."
00:58:51.235,00:58:55.448,Remember that girl I introduced you to? Lorraine?
00:59:00.536,00:59:02.454,What are you writing?
00:59:02.538,00:59:04.623,"Uh, stories."
00:59:04.707,00:59:08.919,Science fiction stories about visitors...
00:59:09.003,00:59:12.131,coming down to Earth from other planets.
00:59:14.467,00:59:18.512,Get outta town! I didn’t know you did anything creative.
00:59:18.596,00:59:21.390,Let me read some.
00:59:21.474,00:59:24.643,I never– I never let anybody read my stories.
00:59:24.727,00:59:26.645,Why not?
00:59:26.729,00:59:28.689,"Well, what if they didn’t like them?"
00:59:28.773,00:59:31.484,What if they told me I was no good?
00:59:33.068,00:59:36.113,I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand.
00:59:37.156,00:59:40.159,"Uh, no. No, not hard at all."
00:59:41.160,00:59:47.332,"So anyway, George, about Lorraine, she really likes you."
00:59:47.416,00:59:50.669,She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her...
00:59:50.753,00:59:53.088,to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance.
00:59:53.172,00:59:57.884,"Oh, yeah. All you gotta do is go over there and ask her."
00:59:57.968,01:00:01.263,"What, right here, right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no?"
01:00:01.347,01:00:04.183,I don’t know if I could take that kind of a rejection.
01:00:05.601,01:00:09.605,"Besides, I think she’d rather go with somebody else."
01:00:10.648,01:00:12.191,"Uh, who?"
01:00:13.859,01:00:15.361,Biff.
01:00:16.445,01:00:19.030,Little kiss. Come on.
01:00:21.242,01:00:23.285,You know you want me to give it to you.
01:00:23.369,01:00:27.122,Shut your filthy mouth. I’m not that kind of girl.
01:00:27.206,01:00:29.791,Maybe you are and you just don’t know it yet.
01:00:29.875,01:00:32.753,Get your meat hooks off of me.
01:00:32.837,01:00:36.715,She said get your meat hooks... off.
01:00:36.799,01:00:38.467,"Uh, please."
01:00:39.718,01:00:41.804,"So what’s it to you, butthead?"
01:00:42.888,01:00:58.320,"You know, you been lookin’ for a– Since you’re new here, uh, I’m gonna cut you a break..."
01:00:58.404,01:01:00.781,today.
01:01:00.865,01:01:03.325,So why don’t you make like a tree...
01:01:03.409,01:01:05.411,and get outta here.
01:01:20.217,01:01:22.177,Why do you keep following me around?
01:01:22.261,01:01:23.595,"Look, George."
01:01:23.679,01:01:30.477,"I’m telling you, George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I’m gonna regret it for the rest of my life."
01:01:30.561,01:01:33.396,"I’ll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater."
01:01:33.480,01:01:37.025,"Yeah, but, George, Lorraine wants to go with you."
01:01:37.109,01:01:40.362,Give her a break.
01:01:40.446,01:01:43.114,to ask Lorraine out to the dance.
01:01:43.198,01:01:46.201,And not you or anybody else on this planet...
01:01:46.285,01:01:48.537,is gonna make me change my mind.
01:01:55.753,01:01:57.880,Science Fiction Theater.
01:02:27.076,01:02:30.954,Who are you?
01:02:35.668,01:02:39.087,"Silence, Earthling."
01:02:39.171,01:02:41.632,My name is Darth Vader.
01:02:47.054,01:02:50.849,I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan.
01:02:56.939,01:02:59.316,Marty! Marty!
01:02:59.400,01:03:01.651,You weren’t at school. What have you been doing all day?
01:03:01.735,01:03:04.362,"I overslept. Look, I need your help."
01:03:04.446,01:03:07.532,"I have to ask Lorraine out, but I don’t know how to do it."
01:03:07.616,01:03:10.285,"All right, listen. Keep your pants on. She’s over in the café."
01:03:10.369,01:03:17.417,"God! How do you– What made you change your mind, George?"
01:03:17.501,01:03:20.086,"Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan..."
01:03:20.170,01:03:23.173,"and told me that if I didn’t take Lorraine out, that he’d melt my brain."
01:03:23.257,01:03:27.135,"Yeah, well, let’s just keep this brain-melting stuff to ourselves, okay?"
01:03:27.219,01:03:30.639,"Oh, yeah. Yeah."
01:03:30.723,01:03:33.058,Now just go in there and invite her. Okay.
01:03:33.142,01:03:35.602,But I don’t know what to say.
01:03:35.686,01:03:38.772,"Say whatever’s natural, the first thing that comes into your mind."
01:03:39.898,01:03:42.108,Nothing’s coming to my mind.
01:03:42.192,01:03:44.110,"Jesus, George. It’s a wonder I was even born."
01:03:44.194,01:03:47.030,What? What?
01:03:47.114,01:03:50.951,Look. Tell her destiny brought you together.
01:03:51.035,01:03:52.994,Tell her that she is the most beautiful girl...
01:03:53.078,01:03:55.288,you have ever seen in the world.
01:03:55.372,01:03:58.291,"Girls like that stuff. What are you doing, George?"
01:03:58.375,01:04:00.335,I’m writing this down. This is good stuff.
01:04:00.419,01:04:03.505,"Yeah. Okay, let’s go. Can you take care of that?"
01:04:22.149,01:04:25.110,"Lou, give me a milk."
01:04:26.195,01:04:28.113,Chocolate.
01:04:34.953,01:04:36.872,And a cherry Coke.
01:04:43.962,01:04:45.463,Lorraine?
01:04:45.547,01:04:47.132,My density...
01:04:47.216,01:04:49.301,has popped me to you.
01:04:50.385,01:04:52.846,- What? - Oh.
01:04:52.930,01:04:58.477,What I meant to say was– Wait a minute. Don’t I know you from somewhere?
01:04:59.561,01:05:02.063,Yes. Yes.
01:05:02.147,01:05:05.275,I’m George. George McFly.
01:05:05.359,01:05:07.402,I’m your density.
01:05:07.486,01:05:12.615,I mean– Your destiny.
01:05:12.699,01:05:15.285,Oh.
01:05:15.369,01:05:17.412,"Hey, McFly!"
01:05:21.458,01:05:23.836,I thought I told you never to come in here.
01:05:26.922,01:05:30.592,"Well, it’s gonna cost you. How much money you got on you?"
01:05:30.676,01:05:33.554,"Well, how much do you want, Biff?"
01:05:41.603,01:05:43.605,"All right, punk."
01:05:43.689,01:05:47.025,"Now I’m gonna– Whoa, whoa, Biff. What’s that?"
01:05:53.031,01:05:56.659,"That’s Calvin Klein. Oh, my God, he’s a dream."
01:05:56.743,01:05:59.704,"Whoa! Kid! Kid, stop! Stop, stop. Stop!"
01:05:59.788,01:06:01.790,Stop.
01:06:01.874,01:06:04.125,"I’ll get it back to you, all right?"
01:06:04.209,01:06:06.419,- There he is! - You broke it!
01:06:06.503,01:06:08.505,Come back here!
01:06:10.549,01:06:12.551,Wow! Look at him go!
01:06:13.802,01:06:15.846,Get him!
01:06:28.650,01:06:30.485,To the car! Go!
01:06:37.326,01:06:39.702,What’s that thing he’s on?
01:06:39.786,01:06:41.746,He’s an absolute dream.
01:06:41.830,01:06:44.666,"- Come on, come on! - Look out for the car!"
01:07:39.304,01:07:41.306,Whoo!
01:07:53.193,01:07:55.237,"Thanks a lot, kid."
01:07:56.446,01:07:58.573,I’m gonna get that son of a bitch.
01:07:58.657,01:08:01.701,Where does he come from?
01:08:04.329,01:08:06.331,but I’m gonna find out.
01:08:15.007,01:08:18.801,"I don’t know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!"
01:08:22.681,01:08:26.434,"Oh, my God. They found me."
01:08:26.518,01:08:30.438,"I don’t know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!"
01:08:30.522,01:08:32.774,Doc?
01:08:32.858,01:08:36.653,"Oh, hi, Marty. I didn’t hear you come in."
01:08:36.737,01:08:40.156,"Fascinating device, this video unit."
01:08:40.240,01:08:42.116,"Listen, Doc."
01:08:42.200,01:08:45.370,There’s something I haven’t told you about the night we made that tape.
01:08:45.454,01:08:47.455,No man should know too much about his own destiny.
01:08:47.539,01:08:49.290,You don’t understand.
01:08:49.374,01:08:51.960,"If I know too much about my future, I could endanger my existence..."
01:08:52.044,01:08:53.795,just as you have endangered yours.
01:08:55.422,01:08:57.340,You– You’re right.
01:08:57.424,01:09:00.510,"Now, let me show you my plan for sending you home."
01:09:00.594,01:09:02.428,Please excuse the crudity of this model.
01:09:02.512,01:09:05.139,I didn’t have time to build it to scale or to paint it.
01:09:05.223,01:09:08.309,It’s good.
01:09:08.393,01:09:11.479,"Okay, now, we run some industrial-strength electrical cable..."
01:09:11.563,01:09:16.985,"from the top of the clock tower, down, suspending it over the street between these two lampposts."
01:09:17.069,01:09:19.821,"Meanwhile, we’ve outfitted the time vehicle..."
01:09:19.905,01:09:21.906,with this big pole and hook...
01:09:21.990,01:09:25.660,which runs directly into the flux capacitor.
01:09:25.744,01:09:30.331,"At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street..."
01:09:30.415,01:09:34.002,"driving directly toward the cable, accelerating to 88 miles per hour."
01:09:35.212,01:09:37.505,"According to the flyer, at precisely 10:04 p.m...."
01:09:37.589,01:09:42.051,"this Saturday night, lightning will strike the clock tower, electrifying the cable..."
01:09:42.135,01:09:47.682,"just as the connecting hook makes contact, thereby sending 1.21 gigawatts into the flux capacitor..."
01:09:47.766,01:09:50.268,and sending you back to 1985.
01:09:50.352,01:09:52.687,"All right, now. Watch this."
01:09:52.771,01:09:54.898,You wind up the car and release it.
01:09:56.024,01:09:57.943,I’ll simulate the lightning.
01:10:06.451,01:10:07.786,Ready.
01:10:17.879,01:10:20.715,Set.
01:10:23.468,01:10:24.761,Release.
01:10:43.738,01:10:46.074,"You’re not instilling me with a lot of confidence, Doc."
01:10:46.158,01:10:49.536,Don’t worry. I’ll take care of ideas. You take care of your pop.
01:10:51.455,01:10:54.374,"By the way, what happened today? Did he ask her out?"
01:10:54.458,01:10:56.959,I think so.
01:11:05.469,01:11:07.470,It’s your mom! She’s tracked you down!
01:11:07.554,01:11:09.556,Quick! Let’s cover the time machine.
01:11:22.819,01:11:25.488,"Hi, Mar– Cal– Marty."
01:11:25.572,01:11:27.490,Mom– Lorraine.
01:11:27.574,01:11:30.577,"Uh, how did you know I was here?"
01:11:31.703,01:11:33.371,I followed you.
01:11:34.706,01:11:36.874,"Oh, uh, this is my, uh, Doc– My uncle..."
01:11:36.958,01:11:40.378,Doc... Brown.
01:11:40.462,01:11:42.338,Hi.
01:11:45.133,01:11:54.559,"Marty, this may seem a little forward, but I was kind of wondering if– i-if you’d ask me to the..."
01:11:54.643,01:11:56.978,Enchantment Under the Sea dance on Saturday?
01:11:59.231,01:12:03.317,"Uh, you mean– You mean nobody’s asked you?"
01:12:03.401,01:12:05.319,No.
01:12:05.403,01:12:06.905,Not yet.
01:12:08.156,01:12:11.493,What about– What about George?
01:12:13.245,01:12:23.171,"Oh, he– He’s kind of cute and all, but, uh, not– Well, I think a man should be strong..."
01:12:25.090,01:12:27.092,so he can stand up for himself...
01:12:28.343,01:12:30.345,and protect the woman he loves.
01:12:34.432,01:12:36.601,Don’t you?
01:12:37.519,01:12:39.520,Yeah.
01:12:39.604,01:12:41.814,I still don’t understand.
01:12:41.898,01:12:44.484,How am I supposed to go to the dance with her...
01:12:44.568,01:12:47.445,if she’s already going to the dance with you?
01:12:47.529,01:12:50.531,"Well, because, George, she wants to go with you."
01:12:50.615,01:12:52.533,She just doesn’t know it yet.
01:12:52.617,01:12:55.495,"That’s why we gotta show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter."
01:12:55.579,01:12:59.499,"You’re somebody who’s gonna stand up for yourself, somebody who’s gonna protect her."
01:12:59.583,01:13:02.084,"Yeah, but I’ve never picked a fight in my entire life."
01:13:02.168,01:13:07.548,"Look, you’re not gonna be picking a fight, Dad– dad-dad-daddio."
01:13:07.632,01:13:09.926,"You’re coming to her rescue, right?"
01:13:10.010,01:13:12.803,"Okay, let’s go over the plan again. 8:55, where you gonna be?"
01:13:12.887,01:13:15.848,I’m gonna be at the dance.
01:13:15.932,01:13:17.975,You’re gonna be in the car with her.
01:13:18.059,01:13:20.978,"Right, so around 9:00, she’s gonna get very angry with me."
01:13:21.062,01:13:23.523,Why is she gonna get angry with you?
01:13:23.607,01:13:25.816,"Well, because, George, nice girls get angry..."
01:13:25.900,01:13:28.444,when guys take advantage of them.
01:13:28.528,01:13:35.743,"Oh! You mean you’re gonna go touch her on her– No. No, George, look."
01:13:35.827,01:13:38.079,"It’s just an act, right?"
01:13:38.163,01:13:42.291,"Okay. So, 9:00, you’re strolling through the parking lot."
01:13:42.375,01:13:45.419,"You see us, uh, struggling in the car."
01:13:45.503,01:13:53.219,"You walk up, you open the door and you say– Your line, George."
01:13:53.303,01:13:58.642,"Oh! Uh– Hey, you, get your damn hands off her!"
01:14:00.310,01:14:02.770,You really think I oughta swear?
01:14:02.854,01:14:04.772,"Goddamn it, George, swear."
01:14:04.856,01:14:07.775,Okay. So now you come up. You punch me in the stomach.
01:14:07.859,01:14:09.777,"I’m out for the count, right?"
01:14:09.861,01:14:12.947,And you and Lorraine live happily ever after.
01:14:13.031,01:14:15.408,"Oh, you make it sound so easy."
01:14:15.492,01:14:17.451,I just– I wish I wasn’t so scared.
01:14:17.535,01:14:19.453,"George, there’s nothing to be scared of."
01:14:19.537,01:14:21.622,All it takes is a little self-confidence.
01:14:21.706,01:14:26.961,"You know, if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything."
01:14:31.257,01:14:34.093,"Mostly clear, with some scattered clouds."
01:14:34.177,01:14:38.764,Lows tonight in the upper 40s– Are you sure about this storm?
01:14:38.848,01:14:43.144,"Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?"
01:14:43.228,01:14:45.646,"You know, Marty, I’m gonna be very sad to see you go."
01:14:45.730,01:14:47.648,You’ve really made a difference in my life.
01:14:47.732,01:14:49.692,You’ve given me something to shoot for.
01:14:49.776,01:14:58.159,"Just knowing that I’m gonna be around to see 1985, that I’m gonna succeed in this, that I’m gonna have a chance to travel through time!"
01:15:04.708,01:15:07.501,It’s gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you...
01:15:07.585,01:15:10.713,about everything that’s happened in the past few days.
01:15:10.797,01:15:14.050,"I’m really gonna miss you, Marty."
01:15:14.134,01:15:16.177,I’m really gonna miss you.
01:15:20.974,01:15:23.851,"- Doc, about the future– - No!"
01:15:23.935,01:15:27.146,"Marty, we’ve already agreed that having information about the future..."
01:15:27.230,01:15:29.148,can be extremely dangerous.
01:15:29.232,01:15:33.277,"Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically."
01:15:33.361,01:15:38.408,"Whatever you’ve got to tell me, I’ll find out through the natural course of time."
01:15:39.451,01:15:47.375,"Dear Dr. Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be..."
01:15:47.459,01:15:50.753,shot by terrorists.
01:15:50.837,01:15:53.255,Please take whatever precautions are necessary...
01:15:53.339,01:15:55.341,to prevent this terrible disaster.
01:15:57.469,01:16:01.765,"Your friend, Marty."
01:16:10.690,01:16:13.609,"Evening, Dr. Brown. What’s with the wire?"
01:16:13.693,01:16:16.612,"Oh, just a little weather experiment."
01:16:16.696,01:16:18.406,Oh.
01:16:18.490,01:16:20.533,Whatcha got under here?
01:16:20.617,01:16:23.619,"Some new, specialized weather-sensing equipment."
01:16:23.703,01:16:25.663,"You, uh, got a permit for that?"
01:16:25.747,01:16:27.832,Of course I do.
01:16:34.672,01:16:37.509,Just a second. Let me see if I can find it here.
01:17:30.061,01:17:32.271,Do you mind if we...
01:17:32.355,01:17:35.232,park... for a while?
01:17:35.316,01:17:38.652,That’s a great idea. I’d love to park.
01:17:38.736,01:17:41.238,"Marty, I’m almost 18 years old."
01:17:41.322,01:17:43.324,It’s not like I’ve never parked before.
01:17:44.409,01:17:46.327,What?
01:17:46.411,01:17:49.330,"Marty, you seem so nervous. Is something wrong?"
01:17:49.414,01:17:51.457,No.
01:17:51.541,01:17:53.751,No.
01:17:57.297,01:18:00.216,"Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doin’?"
01:18:00.300,01:18:02.718,I swiped it from the old lady’s liquor cabinet.
01:18:02.802,01:18:05.638,"Yeah, well, you shouldn’t drink."
01:18:05.722,01:18:08.349,Why not?
01:18:05.722,01:18:11.769,Because you– You might regret it later in life.
01:18:11.853,01:18:13.854,"Marty, don’t be such a square."
01:18:13.938,01:18:16.608,Everybody who’s anybody drinks.
01:18:21.696,01:18:24.365,"Geez, you smoke too?"
01:18:24.449,01:18:26.618,"Marty, you’re beginning to sound just like my mother."
01:18:38.671,01:18:44.135,"We’re gonna take a little break, but we’ll be back in a while, so, uh, don’t nobody go nowhere."
01:19:00.818,01:19:04.072,Marty? Why are you so nervous?
01:19:05.073,01:19:17.334,"Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you knew you had to act a certain way, but when you got there, you didn’t know if you could go through with it?"
01:19:17.418,01:19:20.170,"Oh, you mean like how you’re supposed to act on a first date?"
01:19:20.254,01:19:23.257,"Oh, uh, sort of."
01:19:23.341,01:19:27.804,I– I think I know exactly what you mean.
01:19:28.846,01:19:31.557,You know what I do in those situations?
01:19:31.641,01:19:34.018,What?
01:19:51.285,01:19:53.287,This is all wrong.
01:19:53.371,01:20:01.587,"I don’t– I don’t know what it is, but when I kiss you, it’s like I’m kissing..."
01:20:01.671,01:20:03.631,my brother.
01:20:03.715,01:20:06.800,"I guess that doesn’t make any sense, does it?"
01:20:06.884,01:20:08.969,Believe me.
01:20:09.053,01:20:11.055,It makes perfect sense.
01:20:11.139,01:20:13.182,Somebody’s coming.
01:20:18.062,01:20:24.318,"You caused 300 bucks’ damage to my car, you son of a bitch, and I’m gonna take it outta your ass."
01:20:24.402,01:20:26.403,Hold him.
01:20:26.487,01:20:29.239,"Let him go, Biff. You’re drunk."
01:20:29.323,01:20:32.201,"Well, lookee what we have here."
01:20:35.246,01:20:38.999,"No, no! Stay right here with me. Come on, Lorraine."
01:20:39.083,01:20:41.043,"Leave her alone, you bastard!"
01:20:41.127,01:20:43.420,"You guys, take him in back. I’ll be right there."
01:20:43.504,01:20:45.506,Just admit that you want it.
01:20:45.590,01:20:48.760,"Come on. Well, go on. This ain’t no peep show."
01:20:55.600,01:20:57.810,"Hey, let’s put him in there."
01:20:59.562,01:21:01.522,That’s for messing up my hair.
01:21:01.606,01:21:03.774,What the hell are you doing to my car?
01:21:03.858,01:21:06.027,"Hey, beat it, spook. This don’t concern you."
01:21:09.280,01:21:12.282,"Who you callin’ spook, peckerwood?"
01:21:12.366,01:21:14.952,"Hey, hey, listen, guys."
01:21:15.036,01:21:17.204,"Look, I don’t wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?"
01:21:17.288,01:21:19.415,"Get home to your mama, boy."
01:21:19.499,01:21:21.458,"Biff! Biff! Hurry, Biff!"
01:21:21.542,01:21:23.669,Let me outta here!
01:21:23.753,01:21:25.671,Yo!
01:21:25.755,01:21:27.673,"Reginald, where are your keys?"
01:21:27.757,01:21:30.050,The keys are in the trunk.
01:21:30.134,01:21:33.221,Say that again?
01:21:50.363,01:21:58.162,"Hey, you, get your damn hands off– I think you got the wrong car, McFly."
01:21:59.664,01:22:02.207,"George, help me! Please!"
01:22:02.291,01:22:06.587,"Just turn around, McFly, and walk away."
01:22:06.671,01:22:08.422,"Please, George."
01:22:08.506,01:22:10.591,Close the door and beat it.
01:22:13.261,01:22:16.930,"No, Biff. You leave her alone."
01:22:17.014,01:22:19.517,"All right, McFly."
01:22:22.687,01:22:26.940,"You’re asking for it, and now you’re gonna get it."
01:22:27.024,01:22:29.943,"Biff, stop it!"
01:22:30.027,01:22:32.196,Stop it. You’ll break his arm!
01:22:33.781,01:22:35.824,"Biff, no!"
01:22:35.908,01:22:38.327,"Gimme a hand here, Reginald."
01:22:38.411,01:22:41.455,"Ow! Damn it, man! I sliced my hand!"
01:22:41.539,01:22:43.457,Whose are these?
01:22:43.541,01:22:45.668,Thanks. Thanks a lot.
01:22:46.711,01:22:49.004,You’re gonna break his arm!
01:22:49.088,01:22:52.841,"Biff! Biff, leave him alone!"
01:22:52.925,01:22:55.303,Let him go! Let him go!
01:23:27.585,01:23:29.587,Are you okay?
01:23:49.941,01:23:51.942,Who is that guy?
01:23:52.026,01:23:53.945,That’s George McFly.
01:23:57.782,01:24:00.618,That’s George McFly?
01:24:11.671,01:24:13.756,The storm.
01:24:15.132,01:24:17.801,"Hey, guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance."
01:24:17.885,01:24:19.428,"Hey, man, look at Marvin’s hand."
01:24:19.512,01:24:22.347,"He can’t play with this hand like that, and we can’t play without him."
01:24:22.431,01:24:24.099,"Yeah, well, look, Marvin, you gotta play."
01:24:24.183,01:24:28.604,"That’s where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor, and if there’s no music, they can’t dance."
01:24:28.688,01:24:30.606,"And if they can’t dance, they can’t kiss."
01:24:30.690,01:24:33.108,"If they can’t kiss, they can’t fall in love, and I’m history."
01:24:33.192,01:24:36.403,"The dance is over, unless you know somebody else that can play the guitar."
01:24:43.828,01:24:46.330,This is for all you lovers out there.
01:25:00.011,01:25:02.262,"George, aren’t you gonna kiss me?"
01:25:02.346,01:25:04.307,I– I don’t know.
01:25:05.349,01:25:08.518,"Scram, McFly. I’m cuttin’ in."
01:25:21.032,01:25:23.700,"Hey, boy, you all right?"
01:25:23.784,01:25:25.285,I can’t play.
01:25:25.369,01:25:27.163,George!
01:25:42.720,01:25:45.222,George!
01:25:46.891,01:25:48.851,George?
01:25:50.603,01:25:52.563,Excuse me.
01:26:39.110,01:26:43.530,"Yeah. Yeah, man, that was good. Let’s do another one."
01:26:43.614,01:26:45.615,"Oh, no. I gotta go."
01:26:45.699,01:26:48.869,"Come on, man. Let’s do something that really cooks."
01:26:48.953,01:26:52.081,Something that– that cooks.
01:26:57.378,01:26:59.964,All right.
01:27:05.928,01:27:14.812,"All right, this is, uh, this is an oldie but, uh– Well, it–it’s an oldie where I come from."
01:27:16.814,01:27:19.149,"All right, guys, listen. This is a blues riff in B."
01:27:19.233,01:27:21.819,"Watch me for the changes, and try and keep up, okay?"
01:28:05.196,01:28:07.155,"George, I heard you laid out Biff. Nice goin’."
01:28:07.239,01:28:09.783,"George, you ever think of running for class president?"
01:28:30.888,01:28:33.849,"Chuck! Chuck, it’s Marvin."
01:28:33.933,01:28:36.643,"Your cousin, Marvin Berry?"
01:28:36.727,01:28:39.521,You know that new sound you lookin’ for?
01:28:39.605,01:28:41.732,"Well, listen to this!"
01:29:50.467,01:29:53.470,I guess you guys aren’t ready for that yet.
01:29:54.888,01:29:56.890,But your kids are gonna love it.
01:30:00.477,01:30:02.395,Lorraine.
01:30:02.479,01:30:05.148,"Marty, that was very interesting music."
01:30:05.232,01:30:07.150,"Uh, yeah."
01:30:07.234,01:30:11.071,"Uh, I hope you don’t mind, but George asked if he could take me home."
01:30:11.155,01:30:13.823,"Great! Good. Good, Lorraine."
01:30:13.907,01:30:15.825,I had a feeling about you two.
01:30:15.909,01:30:18.161,I have a feeling too.
01:30:18.245,01:30:23.250,"Listen, I gotta go, but, uh, I wanted to tell you that it’s been..."
01:30:23.334,01:30:25.585,educational.
01:30:25.669,01:30:27.880,"Marty, will we ever see you again?"
01:30:28.964,01:30:30.924,I guarantee it.
01:30:31.008,01:30:34.010,"Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice."
01:30:34.094,01:30:36.596,I’ll never forget it.
01:30:36.680,01:30:38.682,"Right, George."
01:30:40.100,01:30:44.104,"Well, uh, good luck, you guys."
01:30:45.230,01:30:49.276,Oh. One other thing.
01:30:49.360,01:31:00.036,"If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he’s eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, go easy on him."
01:31:00.120,01:31:02.206,Okay.
01:31:07.252,01:31:10.547,Marty. Such a nice name.
01:31:15.052,01:31:18.013,Damn! Where is that kid?
01:31:21.308,01:31:22.810,Damn!
01:31:24.895,01:31:26.855,Damn! Damn!
01:31:34.405,01:31:37.198,You’re late! Do you have no concept of time?
01:31:37.282,01:31:39.701,"Hey, come on! I had to change."
01:31:39.785,01:31:43.288,Do you think I’m going back in that– that zoot suit?
01:31:43.372,01:31:45.373,The old man really came through. It worked.
01:31:45.457,01:31:48.668,He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn’t know he had it in him.
01:31:48.752,01:31:51.255,He’s never stood up to Biff in his life.
01:31:53.006,01:31:56.843,Never?
01:31:56.927,01:31:58.845,All right!
01:31:58.929,01:32:01.014,Let’s set your destination time.
01:32:05.978,01:32:09.105,This is the exact time you left.
01:32:09.189,01:32:12.067,Let’s send you back at exactly the same time.
01:32:15.279,01:32:17.239,It’ll be like you never left.
01:32:18.991,01:32:21.618,"Now, I painted a white line on the street..."
01:32:21.702,01:32:23.536,way over there.
01:32:23.620,01:32:25.538,That’s where you’ll start from.
01:32:25.622,01:32:31.252,"I’ve calculated the precise distance, taking into account the acceleration speed and wind resistance..."
01:32:31.336,01:32:39.928,"retroactive from the moment the lightning strikes, which will be in exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds."
01:32:40.012,01:32:42.389,"When this alarm goes off, you hit the gas."
01:32:42.473,01:32:44.391,Right.
01:32:50.314,01:32:53.525,"Well, I guess that’s everything."
01:32:57.488,01:32:59.990,Thanks.
01:33:05.287,01:33:07.331,See you in about 30 years.
01:33:09.041,01:33:11.084,I hope so.
01:33:12.252,01:33:14.254,Don’t worry!
01:33:14.338,01:33:16.339,As long as you hit that wire...
01:33:16.423,01:33:26.307,"with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles an hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine."
01:33:26.391,01:33:27.893,All right.
01:33:35.567,01:33:39.863,- What’s the meaning of this? - You’ll find out in 30 years.
01:33:39.947,01:33:41.990,"It’s about the future, isn’t it?"
01:33:42.074,01:33:44.743,It’s information about the future!
01:33:44.827,01:33:46.953,"I warned you about this, kid."
01:33:47.037,01:33:49.789,The consequences could be disastrous!
01:33:49.873,01:33:52.292,"Doc, that’s a risk you’re gonna have to take."
01:33:52.376,01:33:55.128,Your life depends on it!
01:33:55.212,01:33:59.132,I refuse to accept the responsibility.
01:33:59.216,01:34:02.970,"In that case, I’ll tell you straight out!"
01:34:05.722,01:34:07.558,Great Scott!
01:34:15.315,01:34:18.443,You get the cable! I’ll throw the rope down to you!
01:34:18.527,01:34:21.196,Right! I got it!
01:34:51.643,01:34:53.436,Whoo-hoo-hoo!
01:34:53.520,01:34:55.188,Doc!
01:35:03.322,01:35:08.535,"- Come on, come on. Let’s go! - All right! Take it up!"
01:35:10.120,01:35:11.455,Go!
01:35:19.046,01:35:21.214,- Doc! - Huh?
01:35:21.298,01:35:24.717,I have to tell you about the future!
01:35:24.801,01:35:29.222,What?
01:35:29.306,01:35:30.598,What?
01:35:30.682,01:35:37.481,"On the night I go back in time, you get– Oh!"
01:35:38.857,01:35:41.109,Doc!
01:35:46.073,01:35:48.992,Oh!
01:35:49.076,01:35:51.244,Go!
01:35:51.328,01:35:53.872,"- No, Doc! - Look at the time!"
01:35:53.956,01:35:56.082,You’ve got less than four minutes.
01:35:56.166,01:35:58.251,"Please, hurry!"
01:36:09.513,01:36:11.348,Yeah!
01:37:04.317,01:37:07.612,"Damn it, Doc! Why did you have to tear up that letter?"
01:37:07.696,01:37:09.656,If I only had more time.
01:37:12.409,01:37:14.911,Wait a minute. I got all the time I want.
01:37:14.995,01:37:18.539,I got a time machine. I can just go back early and warn him.
01:37:18.623,01:37:20.709,Okay. Ten minutes ought to do it.
01:37:22.919,01:37:28.591,Okay. Time circuit’s on. Flux capacitor: fluxing.
01:37:28.675,01:37:30.843,Engine running. All right.
01:37:33.472,01:37:35.598,"No. No, no, no, no."
01:37:35.682,01:37:37.392,Come on. Come on.
01:37:37.476,01:37:39.519,"Not this time. Come on, come on."
01:38:48.547,01:38:50.590,Come on.
01:38:53.176,01:38:55.846,Here we go. Here we go. This time. Come on.
01:38:57.347,01:39:00.933,Please. Please. Come on!
01:40:38.615,01:40:39.950,Doc.
01:41:28.498,01:41:32.419,Yeah! Ha-ha!
01:42:16.212,01:42:18.882,Crazy drunk driver.
01:42:28.767,01:42:30.727,Whoo!
01:42:33.021,01:42:35.732,"All right. Oh, Fred."
01:42:37.275,01:42:40.069,You look great. Everything looks great.
01:42:42.280,01:42:45.158,"I still got time. I’m comin’, Doc!"
01:42:49.079,01:42:51.330,"No! No, not again!"
01:42:59.422,01:43:01.341,Hey!
01:43:07.138,01:43:09.015,Libyans.
01:44:32.182,01:44:34.684,"Oh, no!"
01:44:48.865,01:44:50.867,You’re alive.
01:45:00.001,01:45:01.961,Bulletproof vest?
01:45:02.045,01:45:03.838,How did you know?
01:45:04.881,01:45:07.884,I-I never got a chance to tell you.
01:45:21.231,01:45:25.234,What about all that talk about screwing up future events?
01:45:25.318,01:45:27.319,The space-time continuum?
01:45:27.403,01:45:30.990,"Well, I figured, what the hell."
01:45:40.792,01:45:42.751,So how far ahead are you going?
01:45:42.835,01:45:46.046,About 30 years. It’s a nice round number.
01:45:46.130,01:45:48.215,"Look me up when you get there, all right?"
01:45:48.299,01:45:50.426,Guess I’ll be about 47.
01:45:50.510,01:45:52.344,I will.
01:45:52.428,01:45:55.181,Take care.
01:45:55.265,01:45:58.517,"Right. Bye-bye, Einie."
01:45:58.601,01:46:00.478,"Oh, and watch that reentry."
01:46:00.562,01:46:02.939,It’s a little bumpy.
01:47:08.755,01:47:10.423,What a nightmare.
01:47:27.065,01:47:30.442,"Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago."
01:47:30.526,01:47:32.736,"- Which one was it, Greg or Craig? - I don’t know."
01:47:32.820,01:47:35.615,I can’t keep up with all of your boyfriends.
01:47:37.200,01:47:40.953,What the hell is this?
01:47:43.706,01:47:48.544,"Yeah. I– Yeah. What are– What are you wearing, Dave?"
01:47:48.628,01:47:52.465,"Marty, I always wear a suit to the office."
01:47:53.508,01:47:55.467,You all right?
01:47:57.804,01:48:00.431,A rematch? Why? Were you cheating?
01:48:00.515,01:48:02.975,Hello.
01:48:04.227,01:48:05.978,Mom! Dad!
01:48:06.062,01:48:08.689,Wh– Did you hit your head?
01:48:08.773,01:48:12.359,"You guys– You guys look great. Mom, you look so thin."
01:48:12.443,01:48:14.946,"Why, thank you, Marty. George!"
01:48:15.988,01:48:17.990,"Good morning, sleepyhead."
01:48:25.081,01:48:28.667,"I sure like her, Marty. She is such a sweet girl."
01:48:28.751,01:48:30.836,Isn’t tonight the night of the big date?
01:48:30.920,01:48:32.755,"What? What, Ma?"
01:48:32.839,01:48:36.675,Aren’t you going up to the lake? You’ve been planning it for two weeks.
01:48:36.759,01:48:38.844,"Mom, we talked about this."
01:48:38.928,01:48:41.013,How can I go to the lake? The car’s wrecked.
01:48:41.097,01:48:43.140,- Wrecked? - Wrecked?
01:48:43.224,01:48:45.351,- What happened? - When did this happen?
01:48:45.435,01:48:49.355,I’m sure the car is fine. Why am I always the last one to know about these things?
01:48:49.439,01:48:51.815,See? There’s Biff out there waxing it right now.
01:48:51.899,01:48:56.779,"Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one."
01:48:56.863,01:48:58.864,I’m just finishing up the second coat now.
01:48:58.948,01:49:01.200,"Now, Biff, don’t con me."
01:49:02.660,01:49:04.578,"I’m– I’m sorry, Mr. McFly."
01:49:04.662,01:49:08.207,I meant I was just starting on the second coat.
01:49:08.291,01:49:10.876,"Ah, Biff. What a character."
01:49:10.960,01:49:13.295,Always trying to get away with something.
01:49:13.379,01:49:16.507,I’ve had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school.
01:49:16.591,01:49:22.471,"Although, if it wasn’t for him– We never would have fallen in love."
01:49:22.555,01:49:25.057,"Mr. McFly! Mr. McFly, this just arrived."
01:49:25.141,01:49:27.810,"Oh, hi, Marty. I think it’s your new book."
01:49:29.896,01:49:31.897,"Oh, honey!"
01:49:31.981,01:49:34.108,Your first novel.
01:49:37.487,01:49:41.407,you can accomplish anything.
01:49:41.491,01:49:43.450,"You’re all waxed up, ready for tonight."
01:49:43.534,01:49:45.661,Keys?
01:50:00.676,01:50:02.678,"How about a ride, mister?"
01:50:02.762,01:50:07.683,"Jennifer. Oh, are you a sight for sore eyes."
01:50:07.767,01:50:09.685,Let me look at you.
01:50:09.769,01:50:12.646,"Marty, you’re acting like you haven’t seen me in a week."
01:50:12.730,01:50:14.648,I haven’t.
01:50:14.732,01:50:16.734,You okay?
01:50:16.818,01:50:18.736,Is everything all right?
01:50:24.784,01:50:26.702,Everything is great.
01:50:40.800,01:50:42.676,Marty!
01:50:42.760,01:50:44.804,You’ve gotta come back with me!
01:50:45.847,01:50:48.224,Where? Back to the future.
01:50:52.812,01:50:55.230,"Wait a minute. What are you doin’, Doc?"
01:50:55.314,01:50:56.858,I need fuel.
01:51:00.570,01:51:02.988,Go ahead. Quick. Get in the car.
01:51:03.072,01:51:06.074,"No, no. I just got here, okay? Jennifer’s here."
01:51:06.158,01:51:08.160,We’re gonna take the new truck for a spin.
01:51:08.244,01:51:10.913,"Well, bring her along. This concerns her too."
01:51:10.997,01:51:14.458,What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future?
01:51:14.542,01:51:17.377,Do we become assholes or something?
01:51:17.461,01:51:20.672,"Both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It’s your kids, Marty."
01:51:20.756,01:51:23.008,Something has gotta be done about your kids.
01:51:29.348,01:51:32.601,"Hey, Doc, we better back up. We don’t have enough road to get up to 88."
01:51:32.685,01:51:36.814,"Roads? Where we’re going, we don’t need roads."
