00:00:51.208,00:00:53.833,"Only you can decide what's best for you, Jesse."
00:00:54.791,00:00:56.166,"Not him, not me."
00:01:01.958,00:01:02.958,I'm out.
00:01:09.916,00:01:11.833,"So, what are you gonna do with all that money?"
00:01:14.125,00:01:16.250,Same thing I do with all the other money.
00:01:16.625,00:01:19.375,"How about you, teenage retiree?"
00:01:19.708,00:01:21.333,You'll be living the dream.
00:01:23.916,00:01:26.208,Not sure I should stick around town.
00:01:27.166,00:01:28.458,That's a start.
00:01:29.250,00:01:30.833,Nothing really keeping me here.
00:01:33.375,00:01:34.500,Where would you go?
00:01:35.500,00:01:36.583,If you were me.
00:01:40.208,00:01:41.666,"Like, if you were my age."
00:01:42.708,00:01:43.666,Just play along.
00:01:43.958,00:01:45.208,Make some conversation.
00:01:47.416,00:01:48.458,Alaska.
00:01:50.291,00:01:51.166,Yeah?
00:01:52.125,00:01:56.541,"Yeah, if I were your age, starting fresh, Alaska."
00:01:57.750,00:01:59.000,It's the last frontier.
00:02:00.041,00:02:01.958,"Up there, you could be anything you want."
00:02:07.750,00:02:08.625,Start over.
00:02:15.500,00:02:16.500,Put things right.
00:02:21.416,00:02:23.958,"Sorry, kid, that's the one thing you can never do."
00:03:31.750,00:03:33.125,"Dude, you suck."
00:03:36.208,00:03:38.916,Think you got Cheeto dust in the controller.
00:03:40.250,00:03:42.708,"It's a bad carpenter that blames his hammer, yo."
00:03:42.791,00:03:43.708,Whatever.
00:03:44.458,00:03:46.500,You're apexing too early. You're apexing too early.
00:03:46.583,00:03:50.250,"I'm apexing at the apex, bitch. Don't be telling me how to drive and shit."
00:03:53.041,00:03:54.583,You couldn't drive Miss Daisy.
00:03:55.166,00:03:56.500,Whatever that means.
00:03:57.333,00:04:00.041,You couldn't drive a short bus full of slow kids to the zoo.
00:04:00.333,00:04:02.458,"Yeah, because I'd be too distracted by you."
00:04:02.541,00:04:05.916,"You'd be sitting up front, in your special helmet, trying to hump my leg."
00:04:06.625,00:04:10.500,On account you couldn't drive Thelma and Louise off of that cliff. Apex!
00:04:10.583,00:04:13.000,I can't apex more than I'm already apexing.
00:04:16.250,00:04:18.625,"Dude, you-- you drive like my dead grandmoms."
00:04:18.708,00:04:20.083,That's disrespectful.
00:04:59.125,00:05:00.166,"Dude, you lost?"
00:05:08.000,00:05:09.000,Jesse?
00:06:13.708,00:06:16.583,"Man, what's wrong with you? I ain't watching no TV right now."
00:06:17.083,00:06:18.208,It's the news.
00:06:37.916,00:06:39.791,was altered and used to carry out this attack?
00:06:40.291,00:06:45.125,"To the best of my knowledge, it was an M60 machine gun, which, yes, that's strictly a military issue weapon."
00:06:45.208,00:07:09.000,"As to where he could have obtained such a weapon, or the so-called remote control aspect of it, anything I could say at this point would just be conjecture, We're hearing a lot of conflicting information and I'm unclear whether this person took part in the killings, or whether they were, in fact, I guess the word we keep hearing is liberated."
00:07:10.166,00:07:13.875,Were they liberated by White from some sort of captivity?
00:07:16.375,00:07:21.708,"They're a person of interest and they may have information relevant to this case, or other cases the DEA's investigating."
00:08:33.583,00:08:35.875,"My stuff's gonna fit you like a T, yo."
00:08:36.625,00:08:39.166,Not like if you had to borrow it from Sasquatch over here.
00:08:39.250,00:08:41.166,Can't help it that I'm sized for love.
00:08:41.250,00:08:43.750,"Yeah, you go love all the giraffes you want, bitch."
00:08:44.000,00:08:46.208,Me and Jesse are sticking with the ladies.
00:08:48.416,00:08:50.000,"Yeah, this here's barely worn."
00:08:50.750,00:08:51.833,How's this working for you?
00:08:52.916,00:08:53.791,Good?
00:09:00.208,00:09:01.083,Right on.
00:09:01.166,00:09:02.833,Get you some new clothes then.
00:09:04.208,00:09:06.375,Shower will make you feel a whole lot better.
00:09:07.875,00:09:09.875,"Truth be told, you look like you're hurting for one."
00:09:10.166,00:09:11.041,Church.
00:09:11.250,00:09:12.583,No offense.
00:09:15.500,00:09:18.625,"Got you a clean towel, the one on the right. Well, kinda."
00:09:18.708,00:09:21.708,"And feel free to open up a new bar of Irish Spring, whatever."
00:09:21.791,00:09:22.791,"It's underneath, you know."
00:09:22.875,00:09:30.291,"'Cause the old one might have, like, hairs on it and shit, and uh, yo, I got Axe body spray, I got Obsession for Men, I got Tommy Hilfinger."
00:09:30.375,00:09:33.250,"Feel free to use any of 'em you want, you know? Use 'em all."
00:09:33.708,00:09:36.541,"Obsession's the bomb, yo. I got it for him for Christmas."
00:09:37.916,00:09:40.041,"Oh, uh, hey, um..."
00:09:41.541,00:09:44.041,"Maybe don't, like, shave and whatnot, you know?"
00:09:44.166,00:09:46.125,"Uh, be less recognizable?"
00:09:50.208,00:09:52.375,"Jesse, did they really..."
00:09:55.708,00:09:56.583,What?
00:09:59.291,00:10:01.041,Did they really keep you in a cage?
00:10:35.833,00:10:36.750,Woo hoo!
00:10:36.875,00:10:37.875,No!
00:11:12.625,00:11:15.041,"-Whoa, dude. Why'd you-- -Looking sharp, yo."
00:11:18.791,00:11:20.375,"Yeah, looking sharp."
00:11:21.833,00:11:23.125,Feel like a new man?
00:11:24.083,00:11:25.666,Yeah. Thanks.
00:11:26.041,00:11:28.041,"Want a little something, take the edge off?"
00:11:30.083,00:11:30.916,No.
00:11:32.166,00:11:33.958,"Why'd you, uh, turn off the TV?"
00:11:35.708,00:11:36.791,News that bad?
00:11:37.500,00:11:40.083,"There's just, uh... a whole lot of it."
00:11:42.791,00:11:44.000,I gotta get out of here.
00:11:46.541,00:11:48.333,Where to? You got a plan?
00:12:03.000,00:12:06.333,"Hey, uh, Skinny, you got a burner you can give me?"
00:12:08.833,00:12:10.750,Fully charged and clean as a whistle.
00:12:34.833,00:12:37.333,remains unconfirmed by federal authorities.
00:12:37.416,00:12:45.916,"However, APD sources say the suspect is Jesse Bruce Pinkman, a local man who was a student of White's before joining him in the drug trade."
00:12:47.833,00:12:52.125,for the largest methamphetamine manufacturing operation in US history.
00:12:52.875,00:13:00.333,"Sources speculate the two had a falling out, after which it is believed Pinkman was manufacturing the drug -for the group holding him captive. -Go for Joe."
00:13:00.416,00:13:04.208,Police are now on the hunt for Pinkman and urging the community to remain vigilant.
00:13:04.291,00:13:08.750,"They're asking anyone with information -to contact APD or call Crimestoppers... -Yeah, I know who this is."
00:13:08.833,00:13:10.833,"At this point, who doesn't?"
00:13:20.958,00:13:21.833,Hey.
00:13:23.416,00:13:25.541,-Where's the victim? -It's in the back.
00:13:25.875,00:13:29.041,"Look, thank you so much for doing this, Joe."
00:13:29.625,00:13:32.458,"About the money, if we can maybe-- It's on the house."
00:13:35.708,00:13:36.708,Good kid.
00:13:37.208,00:13:38.333,Least I can do.
00:13:51.375,00:13:53.083,Magnets!
00:13:53.166,00:13:54.041,Yeah.
00:13:54.666,00:13:56.375,That was a good one. So...
00:13:57.166,00:14:02.750,"Frankly, you know, I can tell you now, I had zero confidence that that would work."
00:14:02.833,00:14:06.375,"None whatsoever, but hey, live and learn."
00:14:06.458,00:14:07.666,"Joe, what are you doing?"
00:14:07.750,00:14:09.791,Writing myself a little insurance policy.
00:14:10.208,00:14:11.875,"You know, strictly precautionary."
00:14:12.875,00:14:14.250,Belt and suspenders.
00:14:15.333,00:14:16.208,Okay.
00:14:18.458,00:14:20.666,"All right, mind at ease, think we're good."
00:14:26.250,00:14:28.541,Joe! Joe!
00:14:36.708,00:14:38.958,"Fleeing, and I suggest you do the same."
00:14:39.041,00:14:42.291,"LoJack. The company just activated it, just this minute."
00:14:43.250,00:14:44.250,Talk about timing.
00:14:44.666,00:14:48.791,"-Just-- -Look, Johnny Law is on his way, as in here, as in now."
00:14:48.875,00:14:52.416,"So farewell, goodbye, regrets, etcetera etcetera."
00:15:05.666,00:15:06.541,Skinny...
00:15:11.083,00:15:12.041,Sorry.
00:15:12.375,00:15:13.833,Who's got the keys to that car?
00:15:14.791,00:15:15.708,Keys!
00:15:29.083,00:15:32.000,Yo. Yo! What are you doing? We gotta get this thing outta here.
00:15:37.500,00:15:38.375,You take my car.
00:15:38.458,00:15:39.833,I don't even like your car.
00:15:40.541,00:15:41.708,Drives like a dick.
00:15:41.791,00:15:45.041,"Badger drives my T-bird 200, 300 miles away and ditches it."
00:15:45.125,00:15:46.750,Think you'll be heading to Mexico?
00:15:48.666,00:15:49.916,"Right on, even better."
00:15:50.000,00:15:51.125,Leave it near the border.
00:15:51.208,00:15:55.000,"Hide it, kind of, but, yo, don't hide it so good the cops can't find it."
00:15:55.083,00:15:57.250,"Wipe it down for prints, then hitchhike back."
00:15:57.333,00:15:59.333,Do not let nobody see you in that car.
00:15:59.666,00:16:01.958,"-You, take Badger's Fiero. -What about this car?"
00:16:02.500,00:16:03.833,It stays right here.
00:16:04.250,00:16:06.666,Ain't like the cops don't already know where it is.
00:16:06.916,00:16:12.041,"I'll tell 'em you dropped by, the two of us smoked a fat bowl, traded pink slips, then you split."
00:16:13.333,00:16:15.333,I always wanted me an El Camino.
00:16:15.416,00:16:16.916,"And that's church, yo."
00:16:17.458,00:16:19.375,I'll pass any lie detector they give me.
00:16:20.500,00:16:21.916,It's what's happening.
00:16:24.291,00:16:25.458,You got any cash?
00:16:34.083,00:16:35.458,"Yo. Kick in, bitch."
00:16:35.750,00:16:37.541,I'm doing it. Jesus!
00:16:42.375,00:16:44.250,"Guys, I don't know what to say."
00:16:44.708,00:16:46.708,Don't say nothing. Just go.
00:17:04.166,00:17:06.333,Seat belt. Speed limit.
00:17:06.833,00:17:09.666,You got about three hours to get this thing down south.
00:17:10.625,00:17:14.500,"I'll keep my mouth shut till then, but after that, they gonna be putting a APB out on this bitch."
00:17:14.583,00:17:15.708,I'll get her there.
00:17:17.500,00:17:18.791,"Take care of her, Jesse."
00:17:18.916,00:17:20.208,She's a special lady.
00:17:21.333,00:17:23.083,That right there is a clown car.
00:17:23.166,00:17:26.541,No self-respecting outlaw would ever get caught dead in that thing.
00:17:26.625,00:17:28.833,"That's why it's perfect, yo. Deep cover."
00:17:31.416,00:17:32.708,"Vaya con Dios, amigo."
00:17:44.500,00:17:47.333,"Oh, uh, the El Camino, let me see the keys."
00:17:57.625,00:17:58.541,Hold up.
00:18:04.708,00:18:06.916,Just might keep you from getting spotted.
00:18:07.833,00:18:08.916,"Can't hurt, right?"
00:18:17.166,00:18:18.333,Why you doing all this?
00:18:23.458,00:18:24.416,Dude...
00:18:24.875,00:18:26.291,you're my hero and shit.
00:20:46.458,00:20:47.458,You awake?
00:20:53.666,00:20:54.583,Jesse?
00:20:55.500,00:20:56.375,Yeah.
00:21:11.916,00:21:12.791,Yeah.
00:21:16.958,00:21:18.166,You want a cigarette?
00:22:07.000,00:22:09.625,Guy on KOB keeps calling for rain.
00:22:10.500,00:22:11.458,What do you think?
00:22:17.416,00:22:21.125,Guy said like forty percent chance yesterday.
00:22:21.541,00:22:23.083,Sixty percent today.
00:22:24.000,00:22:26.291,Maybe it was even fifty yesterday.
00:22:28.916,00:22:36.375,"But so far, I mean, I-- Yeah, I see clouds, but I wouldn't call 'em rain clouds, just regular..."
00:22:37.666,00:22:39.375,regular cloud-clouds.
00:22:41.208,00:22:43.291,"Anyway, that's what they look like to me."
00:22:44.583,00:22:46.333,"Yeah, well, those guys aren't..."
00:22:46.916,00:22:48.208,always that accurate.
00:22:51.916,00:22:59.083,"I'm not putting myself out there as any kind of expert or whatnot, but I do think it's gonna be..."
00:23:00.041,00:23:01.666,a beautiful afternoon.
00:23:04.375,00:23:05.333,Guess what?
00:23:07.375,00:23:08.458,We're all alone.
00:23:13.625,00:23:14.458,Yeah?
00:23:16.375,00:23:23.625,"Yeah. Uncle Jack took everybody down to Elephant Butte, on account of he got this new Chaparral."
00:23:24.208,00:23:26.666,"It's pretty bad-ass, but I told him..."
00:23:27.291,00:23:31.208,"I'm not really big into waterskiing, plus, somebody's..."
00:23:31.666,00:23:33.125,gotta take care of you.
00:23:34.958,00:23:36.416,"Took some convincing, but..."
00:23:37.583,00:23:38.583,now...
00:23:38.833,00:23:40.791,it's just you and me the whole weekend.
00:23:47.500,00:23:50.000,And I-- I'd really like your help with something.
00:23:54.916,00:23:55.833,So...
00:23:56.583,00:23:58.583,I-- I hate to be all like...
00:23:59.291,00:24:01.875,But we gotta talk ground rules.
00:24:02.291,00:24:08.375,"Uh, if you tried to, you know, escape, I'm gonna have to visit the little boy."
00:24:08.458,00:24:09.875,It'll basically be...
00:24:10.208,00:24:12.416,out of my hands at that point.
00:24:12.916,00:24:18.666,"Uncle Jack made you that promise, and he's gonna want to stick to it."
00:24:19.291,00:24:20.166,So...
00:24:20.791,00:24:22.583,"good behavior, right?"
00:24:24.833,00:24:25.750,Right?
00:24:27.333,00:24:28.208,Good.
00:24:29.500,00:24:31.083,"I appreciate it, Jesse."
00:24:40.041,00:24:41.666,Gotta make sure you don't...
00:24:43.791,00:24:45.250,draw too much attention.
00:24:49.583,00:24:53.458,"I'ma do a better job of keeping you clean from now on, okay?"
00:24:54.416,00:24:55.458,Promise.
00:26:15.000,00:26:16.500,There's no water in it.
00:26:17.291,00:26:20.958,"There used to be water in it, but they took it out a couple years ago 'cause of..."
00:26:21.416,00:26:23.000,some insurance thing.
00:26:24.625,00:26:28.625,"Okay, so, it's not actually that heavy, but..."
00:26:29.208,00:26:33.208,"try as I might, I can't ever get this thing on by myself."
00:26:34.083,00:26:36.458,"What are you better at, going forwards or backwards?"
00:26:39.291,00:26:41.875,"Okay, well, let's both go sideways for a while."
00:26:53.333,00:26:57.500,I thought maybe I could just hang it from the ceiling here...
00:26:59.041,00:27:01.375,"and just drive right under and drop it in, but my..."
00:27:01.916,00:27:04.166,landlord didn't really like that idea.
00:27:10.333,00:27:11.541,I guess that's good.
00:27:14.333,00:27:16.750,I found this thing on Craigslist.
00:27:17.166,00:27:18.041,So...
00:27:20.916,00:27:24.500,-Yeah. -So is that what you needed help with?
00:27:27.375,00:27:28.291,Part of it.
00:27:33.958,00:27:35.916,may yet claim a final victim.
00:27:36.000,00:27:43.750,Texas authorities investigating the poisoning of a Houston woman are looking into her possible connection to Walter White's criminal organization.
00:27:43.833,00:27:49.041,"The unnamed woman, who is hospitalized in critical condition, is not expected to survive."
00:27:49.125,00:27:59.416,"White, the former Albuquerque school teacher who was the subject of a six-month international manhunt, was found dead late Tuesday at the scene of a gang massacre which claimed the lives of nine people."
00:28:00.250,00:28:05.208,The dollar is down today on the foreign exchange markets after an extremely turbulent week for the Euro.
00:28:05.291,00:28:11.750,"The Dow Jones is down 15 points, the NASDAQ is down 34 points, and the S&amp;P 500 is up ten points."

00:28:36.541,00:28:39.125,All residents have been temporarily relocated...
00:31:13.541,00:31:17.000,Did I hear voices? Were you talking to somebody?
00:31:19.208,00:31:20.875,"Hey there, Lou. What you up to?"
00:31:21.250,00:31:23.208,A little horticultural maintenance.
00:31:23.291,00:31:26.583,This ficus down at your end has been looking kinda puny.
00:31:26.666,00:31:28.291,Gotta keep the thrift bugs off it.
00:31:34.208,00:31:37.500,Keep in mind you got over 800 species of the darned thing.
00:31:38.541,00:31:40.916,"Well, all right, Lou, you have a good one."
00:31:55.833,00:31:58.458,"Oh, man. That guy."
00:31:59.250,00:32:01.375,He's not supposed to be home at this hour.
00:32:01.458,00:32:04.250,We really lucked out that he didn't see you.
00:32:05.666,00:32:10.000,"He's just always lurking around, being nosy."
00:32:10.916,00:32:14.791,"I mean, he was in Vietnam, which I totally respect, but still..."
00:32:16.750,00:32:18.875,How you like my place?
00:32:20.625,00:32:22.625,"Yeah, it's... it's nice."
00:32:23.458,00:32:24.458,Kinda...
00:32:25.291,00:32:26.416,pastel.
00:32:26.958,00:32:28.500,"-But in a good way. -Yeah, right?"
00:32:28.583,00:32:32.458,"I was thinking of Easter eggs, but..."
00:32:33.125,00:32:35.208,"lately, I'm thinking I might like to try some new paint."
00:32:35.291,00:32:38.083,This stuff is starting to feel pretty tired.
00:32:39.083,00:32:39.958,Okay.
00:32:40.833,00:32:43.750,"Sure, so, you-- Is that why I'm here? You want me to help you paint?"
00:32:44.583,00:32:46.625,"Maybe, yeah, um..."
00:32:46.875,00:32:48.500,If we have some time left over.
00:32:48.583,00:32:50.833,"But, first, uh..."
00:32:54.625,00:32:55.625,"Oh, shit!"
00:32:58.208,00:32:59.291,Jesus!
00:33:04.166,00:33:05.041,Todd...
00:33:08.750,00:33:09.583,What...
00:33:10.833,00:33:11.666,What...
00:33:12.416,00:33:13.708,"Ah, shit!"
00:33:13.833,00:33:18.958,"Okay, please don't, you know, make me feel worse than I already do."
00:33:21.375,00:33:22.625,Who is this?
00:33:25.208,00:33:29.791,"And honestly, I don't feel much like talking about it, so..."
00:33:33.791,00:33:35.791,"You want to give me a hand, Jesse?"
00:33:43.708,00:33:45.208,Just keep it straight.
00:33:50.000,00:33:51.625,"Oh, w-- wait."
00:33:56.541,00:33:57.666,Unroll it.
00:34:05.375,00:34:06.708,Kinda need this.
00:34:21.041,00:34:21.875,Okay.
00:34:22.250,00:34:26.583,"Now, we just gotta wait for nosy Lou to go bowling."
00:34:27.625,00:34:29.416,I think he leaves in like an hour.
00:34:30.250,00:34:31.458,You want some soup?
00:34:36.750,00:34:37.708,You want soup?
00:34:38.791,00:34:42.000,"I got chicken noodle, chicken and stars, cream of chicken."
00:34:43.250,00:34:44.666,Bean with bacon.
00:34:45.875,00:34:47.583,"One left, Jesse."
00:34:51.958,00:34:55.208,"Oh, she didn't do anything to me."
00:34:58.166,00:34:59.125,Then...
00:35:00.291,00:35:01.125,why?
00:35:06.416,00:35:07.416,Right there.
00:35:07.500,00:35:09.500,"That book, if you wanna know so bad."
00:35:16.666,00:35:20.958,"Uncle Jack taught me always keep my money close, so..."
00:35:21.416,00:35:26.250,"I have these old World Book Encyclopedias, the whole entire set."
00:35:27.250,00:35:28.333,A to Z.
00:35:29.166,00:35:33.291,"My grammy gave 'em to me when I was in middle school, but I figured..."
00:35:34.166,00:35:37.125,"nobody needs books anymore, 'cause everything's on the computer."
00:35:37.625,00:35:40.000,"Uh, it seemed like a good hiding place."
00:35:40.375,00:35:43.000,"Plus, I had all these other volumes left to fill."
00:35:48.041,00:35:50.416,So your cleaning lady was stealing your money?
00:35:50.500,00:35:51.625,What? No.
00:35:53.916,00:35:57.375,She was as honest as the day is long.
00:35:58.833,00:36:00.833,"Like, George Washington honest."
00:36:02.958,00:36:07.916,"But she found it, and I can't have anybody finding it."
00:36:08.791,00:36:11.000,She brought it straight in here to show me.
00:36:12.208,00:36:14.625,She actually thought I didn't know it was there.
00:36:15.250,00:36:18.750,I just-- I wonder what the heck she was looking up?
00:36:19.958,00:36:21.958,She barely spoke any English.
00:36:23.083,00:36:25.416,M for Mexico maybe? I don't know.
00:36:26.458,00:36:27.333,It's weird.
00:36:28.833,00:36:31.458,Where are we gonna... take her?
00:36:33.250,00:36:34.541,Someplace pretty.
00:36:35.541,00:36:36.791,She deserves that.
00:36:39.291,00:36:42.041,"Hey, do me a favor and put that away, would ya?"
00:36:42.125,00:36:45.833,"Just straight down the hall all the way in the back, there's a whole shelf of 'em."
00:36:47.250,00:36:48.125,Thanks.
00:36:49.166,00:36:50.500,Sure you don't want any soup?
00:37:13.833,00:37:15.041,"Pretty bitchin', huh?"
00:37:27.666,00:37:29.500,Be sure to alphabetize them.
00:37:52.375,00:37:55.458,I guess I better come up with a new hiding place for my money.
00:37:59.500,00:38:02.416,They got these things called banks.
00:38:10.000,00:38:13.916,"Actually, I think I know the perfect spot."
00:38:14.875,00:38:17.041,"It might take a little engineering, but..."
00:38:18.500,00:38:21.958,"Man, it would be right here and nobody would ever find it."
00:41:09.000,00:41:11.125,"I mean, he liked to draw. He was good at that."
00:41:13.750,00:41:14.875,Uh...
00:41:15.375,00:41:17.666,A year. Maybe more. I mean...
00:41:18.250,00:41:19.750,it was way before all of this.
00:41:28.625,00:41:29.541,Please...
00:41:30.458,00:41:31.375,come forward.
00:41:32.291,00:41:33.750,Too many people have...
00:41:37.916,00:41:42.125,"For your sake, for everybody's sake, son, turn yourself in."
00:45:25.666,00:45:27.500,You wanna say a few words?
00:45:33.791,00:45:34.625,No.
00:45:43.791,00:45:46.125,"Nice, nice lady."
00:45:48.125,00:45:49.958,Excellent housekeeper.
00:46:10.083,00:46:12.000,There should be one in the glove box.
00:46:24.291,00:46:25.125,You find 'em?
00:46:40.250,00:46:41.541,"I'll take that, Jesse."
00:46:49.291,00:46:50.791,"Jesse, I'll-- I'll take that."
00:47:01.458,00:47:04.791,"On the way home, I was gonna get us some pizza."
00:47:07.125,00:47:09.125,A couple large pies.
00:47:10.583,00:47:12.208,Maybe a six-pack of beer?
00:47:14.458,00:47:15.958,Some ice cold beer.
00:47:19.041,00:47:20.375,Does that sound good?
00:47:22.750,00:47:26.000,'Cause-- 'cause you earned it today.
00:47:26.250,00:47:27.708,You definitely did.
00:47:29.916,00:47:31.916,"What kind of pizza do you like, Jesse?"
00:47:38.125,00:47:39.541,"Jesse, what kind of pizza?"
00:47:46.708,00:47:47.708,Pepperoni.
00:47:50.208,00:47:52.250,Classic. I like that too.
00:48:41.541,00:48:42.500,Come on.
00:48:43.333,00:48:44.625,Look at that view.
00:48:47.083,00:48:49.833,Should be a heck of a sunset.
00:48:53.750,00:48:57.833,"You know what Uncle Jack says, Life is what you make it."
00:51:49.750,00:51:50.916,Yeah!
00:52:37.000,00:52:38.041,Jesus!
00:52:43.583,00:52:45.875,"Oh, hey. You folks are back, huh?"
00:52:46.041,00:52:47.083,Wow.
00:52:47.500,00:52:50.250,"When you search a place, you really search it."
00:52:50.333,00:52:51.750,"Sir, what can we do for you?"
00:52:51.833,00:52:55.416,"I'm Louis Schanzer. I live across the hall, down in unit 11."
00:52:55.500,00:52:57.041,I talked to your guys yesterday.
00:52:57.125,00:53:03.416,"I got a card from one of your sergeants, and I just want you to know I'm around if you ever need any additional information."
00:53:07.458,00:53:09.125,never really trusted him.
00:53:09.833,00:53:11.958,"To be honest, I kinda saw this thing coming."
00:53:12.041,00:53:14.458,"I mean, well, not exactly, but kinda."
00:53:27.875,00:53:32.583,see I've done a little investigating myself. I-- Unit 11.
00:53:34.208,00:53:35.250,Okay.
00:53:36.750,00:53:40.083,"I'll start here, you start in the back. Let's meet in the middle."
00:53:53.625,00:53:54.958,"I mean, Jesus."
00:54:00.625,00:54:04.375,"Neil, they've tossed the shit out of this place. What's left to find?"
00:54:32.125,00:54:33.125,"Hey, little guy."
00:54:36.875,00:54:38.750,Dude's got a tarantula.
00:54:50.750,00:54:53.500,"Yeah, no crazy in this house."
00:54:53.916,00:54:55.375,Perfectly normal.
00:55:00.458,00:55:01.291,Oh.
00:55:08.458,00:55:10.041,I'm no cop killer.
00:55:11.333,00:55:12.666,You be cool...
00:55:13.333,00:55:15.875,and I will be cool.
00:55:16.708,00:55:17.833,Understand?
00:55:36.541,00:55:38.000,Call your partner in here.
00:55:38.875,00:55:41.708,"Casual, very casual."
00:55:41.916,00:55:42.833,Do it.
00:55:44.916,00:55:45.791,"Hey, Lieutenant."
00:55:53.000,00:55:54.250,"Lieutenant, you hear me?"
00:55:56.666,00:55:57.500,Yeah.
00:56:14.666,00:56:15.833,You find something?
00:56:50.083,00:56:51.041,Lieutenant?
00:56:57.250,00:56:59.250,"What's waiting for me back there, Casey?"
00:57:08.416,00:57:10.625,He says he's not looking to kill any cops.
00:57:12.041,00:57:13.416,So let's just...
00:57:14.125,00:57:15.791,"let's figure this out, all right?"
00:57:15.875,00:57:17.625,Let's-- We're gonna figure this out.
00:57:17.708,00:57:19.333,"What are you doing here, Pinkman?"
00:57:20.166,00:57:21.625,There's something I need.
00:57:22.166,00:57:23.708,"As soon as I get it, I am gone."
00:57:23.791,00:57:27.458,"You let me outta here, I swear I will not hurt this guy."
00:57:27.541,00:57:28.916,What's this thing you need?
00:57:29.000,00:57:31.833,"Seriously, throw your gun in here and show me your hands."
00:57:31.916,00:57:34.458,"Seriously, no. You point yours at me, I point mine at you."
00:57:34.541,00:57:35.833,That's how this works.
00:57:36.958,00:57:38.416,What's this thing you need?
00:57:39.250,00:57:42.083,Look... I don't wanna shoot any cops.
00:57:42.166,00:57:44.208,"Yeah, you don't wanna shoot any cops. Great, fantastic."
00:57:44.791,00:57:46.875,You know how many officers we got downstairs?
00:57:48.541,00:57:50.333,"Tell him, Casey, tell him how many."
00:57:51.083,00:57:52.583,"A good six, last I counted."
00:57:52.666,00:57:55.083,"Six my ass, I counted eight of 'em down there."
00:57:55.458,00:57:58.458,"Patrol car on all four corners, more up the street."
00:57:58.791,00:58:01.250,"They hear shooting, what do you think they're gonna do?"
00:58:01.625,00:58:04.208,"Oh, they're coming up. They're coming up, guaranteed."
00:58:04.291,00:58:06.291,"That's right, they're coming up."
00:58:06.833,00:58:08.750,Then how far do you think you're gonna get?
00:58:10.041,00:58:11.916,"There's only one choice here, buddy."
00:58:12.583,00:58:13.875,And you know what it is.
00:58:15.208,00:58:16.166,Come on.
00:58:17.416,00:58:18.916,Nobody wants to hurt you.
00:58:26.041,00:58:27.375,It's your only chance.
00:58:50.041,00:58:50.875,On your stomach.
00:58:53.750,00:58:56.666,Jesus Christ! Are you kidding me?
00:58:57.958,00:58:59.458,Are you kidding me?
00:58:59.541,00:59:01.291,-What now? -Stay on him.
00:59:05.583,00:59:06.541,All right.
00:59:14.458,00:59:15.500,Shut up.
00:59:15.958,00:59:18.416,"Hey, how about some handcuffs, yo."
00:59:20.666,00:59:21.875,What are you doing?
00:59:27.500,00:59:29.083,You two aren't cops.
00:59:29.791,00:59:35.000,You-- Shut the fuck up.
00:59:39.625,00:59:41.208,Find me something to gag him with.
00:59:45.166,00:59:46.000,No!
00:59:49.916,00:59:51.291,I know where the money is.
00:59:59.875,01:00:06.375,"You picked up a couple of windbreakers at the Army &amp; Navy store, came strolling in, all clever and shit."
01:00:07.833,01:00:09.208,"Well, I know where it is."
01:00:09.583,01:00:12.375,And I guaran-fucking-tee you won't find it on your own.
01:00:21.333,01:00:23.458,I got somethin' that might be helpful.
01:00:24.916,01:00:25.750,Hello?
01:00:28.750,01:00:30.916,Detectives? Everything okay?
01:00:33.958,01:00:36.333,"Uh, sorry about that, sir. We're..."
01:00:37.500,01:00:40.791,"dusting for fingerprints, you know? It's a delicate process."
01:00:40.875,01:00:42.750,I thought your CSI boys do that.
01:00:42.833,01:00:44.625,Didn't they get 'em all yesterday?
01:00:44.916,01:00:50.291,"Yeah, well, you know, sometimes, you want something done right-- Oh, God, tell me about it."
01:00:50.375,01:00:54.708,"My line was restaurant and hospitality supplies, so I completely get it."
01:00:55.166,01:00:59.375,"Hey, listen, I just came across an old note Todd Alquist wrote me."
01:00:59.458,01:01:01.458,"-Figured it may be of interest. -Oh, really?"
01:01:01.541,01:01:02.375,Yeah.
01:01:02.583,01:01:05.750,Sort of a half-assed apology he slipped under my door.
01:01:06.041,01:01:15.916,"I'd gone to our landlord about this stupid truck cap of his everybody kept tripping over, and-- Well, anyway, if you need a handwriting sample for analysis."
01:01:16.000,01:01:18.208,"That's-- Yeah, yeah, that could be..."
01:01:18.500,01:01:20.125,"-Yeah, sure. -Left it inside."
01:01:20.208,01:01:23.083,"Didn't want to touch it, speaking of fingerprints."
01:01:23.666,01:01:25.416,You're welcome to come examine it.
01:01:27.750,01:01:29.750,"Oh, it's no trouble. I got time."
01:01:41.166,01:01:43.250,"Show me the money, I let you go."
01:01:46.208,01:01:47.041,Hey.
01:01:47.583,01:01:49.000,"What do you say, huh?"
01:01:49.625,01:01:50.875,Seems pretty fair to me.
01:02:17.166,01:02:19.125,"Oh, shit!"
01:02:19.875,01:02:22.291,-Holy shit! -Keep your voice down.
01:02:25.208,01:02:27.750,there's gotta be a million here. Yeah.
01:02:37.000,01:02:38.208,What are you doing?
01:02:45.083,01:02:47.541,A little man with big dreams? Yeah?
01:02:47.958,01:02:52.166,"Hey, if I were you, I'd walk the hell outta here right now."
01:02:56.708,01:02:58.458,"I'll shoot you, you son of a bitch."
01:03:02.166,01:03:03.916,I will shoot you.
01:03:04.500,01:03:05.625,Then do it already.
01:03:08.625,01:03:12.416,"If I don't get this money, I am dead anyway."
01:03:12.791,01:03:21.416,"All right? If you pull that trigger, then you are gonna have to kill that loudmouth down the hall and every other witness in the place."
01:03:21.708,01:03:25.208,Then you will be as fucked as I am.
01:03:27.375,01:03:28.333,So...
01:03:30.250,01:03:31.458,what's it gonna be?
01:03:44.916,01:03:48.291,Three-way split. And you got your third.
01:03:50.083,01:03:50.958,Don't push it.
01:04:21.375,01:04:23.375,I got the money.
01:04:23.833,01:04:25.833,You gotta keep him talking for the next five minutes.
01:04:25.916,01:04:30.500,"Since I got the Brita, I find the tea tastes noticeably better."
01:04:31.166,01:04:32.458,Not a problem.
01:05:17.166,01:05:19.166,"You got balls, I'll give you that."
01:05:20.875,01:05:22.291,Can I get my gun back?
01:05:23.041,01:05:25.458,Fuck you. Go buy one.
01:05:53.625,01:05:56.000,I was wondering when you were gonna remember me.
01:08:08.416,01:08:11.208,"Uh, I don't expect you'd ever lose it in your closet."
01:08:11.833,01:08:14.750,Mm. And no dirt bag to replace?
01:08:16.000,01:08:18.916,A lot of our customers find that handy and practical.
01:08:19.583,01:08:22.208,But they want an arm and a leg to pay for it.
01:08:22.291,01:08:24.333,And I ain't paying for no paint job.
01:08:24.458,01:08:26.666,"Yes, I agree. It's very expensive."
01:08:26.750,01:08:28.250,But it's a fine product.
01:08:28.750,01:08:33.666,"However, if you are in love with your Kirby, I'll bet I could get it working for you again."
01:08:34.416,01:08:36.291,"Uh, be with you in a minute."
01:08:37.125,01:08:39.833,"Fixing my Kirby, how much would that cost?"
01:08:40.333,01:08:44.000,"Well, I won't know until I take a good look at it, and it..."
01:08:44.541,01:08:50.916,"and if it needed a new motor, it'd be a little bit expensive, but certainly not as expensive as a new Dyson."
01:08:51.333,01:08:53.750,"The estimate's free, and..."
01:08:53.916,01:08:55.625,all you gotta do is bring it in here.
01:08:55.875,01:08:57.791,-I may take you up on that. -Excellent.
01:08:57.875,01:09:01.041,If I can get my niece to help me. They make 'em so heavy.
01:09:01.125,01:09:04.958,"Yes, they do, and I want you to promise you won't try to bring it in by yourself."
01:09:07.916,01:09:11.291,I just don't know why they can't make things to last anymore.
01:09:11.416,01:09:13.416,Oh! You're singing my song.
01:09:16.791,01:09:19.250,"Thank you, thanks for your help. I'll be back with my Kirby."
01:09:23.833,01:09:26.583,"If there's any questions I can answer, just let me know."
01:09:45.083,01:09:47.041,I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't do that.
01:09:48.041,01:09:49.375,I'm open for business.
01:09:54.416,01:09:56.000,"Um, I'm looking for a..."
01:09:56.958,01:09:58.041,Hoover Max.
01:09:59.083,01:10:00.833,"Pressure Max, Max Pressure."
01:10:00.916,01:10:02.541,"Hoover, or maybe it's a Pro Max."
01:10:02.625,01:10:04.333,Got like a-- like a filter.
01:10:05.875,01:10:08.541,Hoover products are right over there on the wall behind you.
01:10:08.625,01:10:10.958,"Look, I don't remember the exact, like, password."
01:10:11.416,01:10:13.083,All right? But it was a vacuum thing.
01:10:16.583,01:10:17.666,"Okay, fine."
01:10:18.666,01:10:19.625,Here you go.
01:10:24.500,01:10:25.416,Four...
01:10:26.041,01:10:26.916,six...
01:10:28.916,01:10:29.750,ten...
01:10:33.125,01:10:39.250,"fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, twenty, twenty-two..."
01:10:41.250,01:10:43.041,"twenty-four, twenty-five."
01:10:43.375,01:10:44.416,There you go.
01:10:44.750,01:10:46.000,"$125,000."
01:10:47.791,01:10:49.500,"Come on, man, you know why I'm here."
01:10:50.791,01:10:52.708,"I can't say I do, no."
01:10:52.791,01:10:55.000,"Yeah, you do. You're the guy."
01:10:56.708,01:10:58.125,"Yeah, you do."
01:10:58.458,01:10:59.791,You're the guy.
01:11:02.041,01:11:06.500,"Look, I am 96 percent sure that you are the guy, so why don't you just, like, admit it?"
01:11:09.583,01:11:11.708,"Look, all right, no wire."
01:11:12.041,01:11:13.833,Okay? No wire.
01:11:14.125,01:11:15.208,And no gun.
01:11:15.291,01:11:17.208,Okay? And nobody knows I'm here.
01:11:17.666,01:11:18.583,I just need...
01:11:19.291,01:11:20.833,just need your services.
01:11:21.625,01:11:26.458,"The day at the pickup spot, you pulled up in a minivan, a red Toyota minivan."
01:11:26.541,01:11:27.958,Looks like a kidney bean.
01:11:28.041,01:11:30.833,Same exact minivan you got parked out back.
01:11:30.916,01:11:32.458,All right? I saw it.
01:11:36.833,01:11:38.833,You got rules. All right.
01:11:40.041,01:11:43.250,"I get that, and I apologize, seriously."
01:11:43.500,01:11:46.000,"I didn't go with you that day, and I am sorry."
01:11:47.458,01:11:53.083,"Look, you will never know how sorry, but I am here now."
01:11:53.833,01:11:55.333,All right? And I have cash.
01:11:56.333,01:11:57.583,"So, please?"
01:11:58.083,01:11:58.916,Okay?
01:11:59.291,01:12:00.333,Please?
01:12:11.875,01:12:15.583,"You're the gu-- -Wait, what? -This..."
01:12:17.833,01:12:19.750,is previously-owed.
01:12:21.875,01:12:30.541,"Going forward, were we to, would require an additional 125."
01:12:36.166,01:12:37.041,All right.
01:12:37.333,01:12:38.375,Fair is fair.
01:12:39.958,01:12:41.041,A deal's a deal.
01:12:42.000,01:12:43.583,All right. Look...
01:12:44.041,01:12:45.083,Four...
01:12:48.875,01:12:49.916,eight...
01:12:51.166,01:12:54.416,"ten, fourteen, eighteen..."
01:12:55.750,01:12:56.708,twenty...
01:12:59.000,01:13:07.416,twenty-- Twenty-two.
01:13:10.708,01:13:11.625,Twenty-two.
01:13:12.833,01:13:13.750,Yeah.
01:13:16.541,01:13:17.625,Twenty-three.
01:13:17.916,01:13:21.375,"By my arithmetic, you're $10,000 shy."
01:13:51.291,01:13:52.333,Eighty-two hundred.
01:13:54.833,01:13:56.000,Eighty-two hundred.
01:14:00.791,01:14:02.000,May I borrow this?
01:14:15.875,01:14:18.166,I'm not gonna try to collect what you owe me.
01:14:19.083,01:14:21.208,I don't think it would end well for either one of us.
01:14:21.666,01:14:23.958,This is not an inconsequential amount of money.
01:14:24.041,01:14:25.041,"Hey, listen to me."
01:14:25.125,01:14:27.791,"Spend it wisely, it will last you for years."
01:14:27.875,01:14:29.625,"Please, you don't understand."
01:14:29.708,01:14:32.583,"Keep a low profile, travel by night."
01:14:34.625,01:14:40.166,"With a little luck, you will soon find yourself many miles from here."
01:14:41.833,01:14:43.250,Godspeed to you.
01:14:46.291,01:14:47.125,So that's it?
01:14:47.208,01:14:48.208,That's it.
01:14:49.333,01:14:50.458,"Now, please leave."
01:14:51.333,01:14:56.875,"You are going to jack me up over a measly $1,800?"
01:14:59.125,01:15:00.500,I've got to reopen.
01:15:01.500,01:15:05.208,"The longer you stick around here, the more you jeopardize yourself."
01:15:09.583,01:15:10.791,No. Hey...
01:15:12.583,01:15:14.208,Have you been watching the news?
01:15:14.291,01:15:16.000,I have. Very much so.
01:15:16.125,01:15:18.166,So you hear what they've been saying about me.
01:15:19.875,01:15:21.333,-Yeah? -Yeah.
01:15:21.416,01:15:27.500,"Look, these people, they have kept me in a concrete hole."
01:15:28.500,01:15:30.291,"Look, I don't even know what month it is."
01:15:31.083,01:15:40.333,"They made me watch when they... when they shot someone-- If you believe that you can pull on people's heartstrings, you should take your chances with the police."
01:15:41.250,01:15:43.541,"From where I sit, you made your own luck."
01:15:44.333,01:15:46.083,As did your former partner.
01:15:46.583,01:15:47.916,As did your lawyer.
01:15:49.375,01:15:51.833,"You said it yourself, a deal's a deal."
01:15:53.791,01:15:54.666,No.
01:15:58.166,01:16:00.625,I am not going anywhere.
01:16:02.083,01:16:06.333,I am staying right here until you help me.
01:16:22.500,01:16:23.541,"Hi, yes."
01:16:23.916,01:16:28.000,"There's a young man in my store, and he refuses to leave."
01:16:29.625,01:16:30.583,I...
01:16:31.375,01:16:33.750,"-Yeah, he might be armed. -Stop it."
01:16:34.541,01:16:35.916,"Uh, not overtly."
01:16:36.000,01:16:38.541,"But, yes, I'm beginning to feel threatened."
01:16:40.708,01:16:42.541,My name is Ed Galbraith.
01:16:42.625,01:16:48.458,"I own Best Quality Vacuum, 2714, 4th Street."
01:16:49.208,01:16:50.625,Northwest. That's correct.
01:16:51.375,01:16:55.125,I would appreciate it very much if you'd send someone immediately.
01:17:12.583,01:17:15.625,You are so full of crap.
01:17:16.583,01:17:18.041,You didn't call anybody just now.
01:17:18.625,01:17:19.500,You faked it.
01:17:19.791,01:17:21.375,And you wanna know how I know?
01:17:22.125,01:17:24.458,You got as much to lose as I do.
01:17:25.250,01:17:27.083,More. Way more.
01:17:27.166,01:17:40.166,"When your cops get here and they bust me, first question they're gonna ask is what am I doing here, trying to hand over a Hefty bag full of cash to a dude who runs a vacuum cleaner store."
01:17:40.583,01:17:42.791,What comes out then? Huh?
01:17:44.708,01:17:47.208,"Oh, and you, uh, wanna know what else is bullshit?"
01:17:47.291,01:17:56.416,"You know, like, word to the wise: next time to try to pull this shit on someone, you don't just hang up on a 9-1-1 call."
01:17:57.208,01:17:58.333,They won't let you.
01:17:58.416,01:18:03.208,"Because the lady, or dude, or whoever is like, Stay on the line with me, sir."
01:18:03.291,01:18:06.500,Stay on the line until the officers arrive.
01:18:06.958,01:18:10.500,"And if you did hang up, they'd call you back immediately."
01:18:10.666,01:18:12.791,"But, hey, guess what?"
01:18:12.875,01:18:15.791,"Seriously, yo. Pathetic."
01:18:18.125,01:18:20.791,"Wow, you gotta love that response time."
01:18:39.000,01:18:41.916,"Officers, thank you very much for getting here so fast."
01:18:42.000,01:18:44.375,-He obviously heard my call and-- -Is he still here?
01:18:44.458,01:18:46.833,"No, he's not, he's gone. I, uh..."
01:18:47.125,01:18:52.333,"Uh, he was spooked by my phone call and he headed up northbound, uh..."
01:18:53.458,01:18:55.458,on foot maybe 30 seconds ago.
01:18:55.541,01:18:57.583,"-Can you describe him? -Uh, sure I can."
01:18:57.666,01:18:58.625,"He was, uh..."
01:18:59.333,01:19:03.250,"young, uh, he's white, skinny, very tall guy."
01:19:03.333,01:19:04.916,"Six-five, six-six."
01:19:05.083,01:19:07.333,Had a tattoo over his right eyebrow.
01:19:35.666,01:19:37.958,"Best Quality Vacuum, how may I help you?"
01:19:45.208,01:19:46.208,It is.
01:19:47.708,01:19:49.250,I'll get you your money.
01:20:23.333,01:20:24.291,Hello?
01:20:27.875,01:20:28.791,Jesse?
01:20:29.375,01:20:30.541,It's Jesse.
01:20:32.166,01:20:33.625,Give me-- Give me the phone.
01:20:34.708,01:20:36.166,"Jesse, is that you?"
01:20:40.000,01:20:41.333,How the both of you doing?
01:20:42.125,01:20:43.166,We've been better.
01:20:43.833,01:20:44.708,Yeah.
01:20:45.833,01:20:48.291,How's Jake? Can I say hi to him?
01:20:53.666,01:20:56.458,I heard you saying that I should turn myself in.
01:21:03.625,01:21:07.750,"Better you come forward on your own, it'll be safer for you, better all around."
01:21:10.833,01:21:12.041,All those years ago?
01:21:12.125,01:21:14.708,"By the little lake, the one with all the ducks?"
01:21:18.916,01:21:22.166,Do you think you guys could come get me maybe?
01:21:28.291,01:21:29.291,"And, uh..."
01:21:29.750,01:21:31.416,it's probably too late to say this...
01:21:32.125,01:21:34.625,I don't know if it'll mean much to you...
01:21:39.041,01:21:40.541,but you did your best.
01:21:42.166,01:21:43.791,And whatever happened with me...
01:21:46.041,01:21:47.125,it's on me.
01:21:47.375,01:21:48.291,Okay?
01:21:49.750,01:21:50.833,Nobody else.
01:23:02.750,01:23:05.083,-Be sure to stay on the house. -Will do.
01:25:01.333,01:25:02.708,Jake's birthday.
01:27:12.958,01:27:15.916,"And then after that, it's the first turn off Broadway."
01:27:18.541,01:27:20.541,"No, then you're gonna go ahead and look for..."
01:27:21.416,01:27:23.125,"Nah, man, don't go by junkyards."
01:27:23.208,01:27:24.791,There's like 50 junkyards.
01:27:25.208,01:27:31.875,"The rebar place is what-- Yeah, the re-- Yeah, exactly."
01:27:33.333,01:27:34.333,That's the one.
01:27:34.583,01:27:35.500,Turn there.
01:27:36.625,01:27:38.750,Yeah. Straight down on the right.
01:27:38.833,01:27:39.916,Look for the sign.
01:27:43.291,01:27:45.166,"Oh, yeah, I got you."
01:27:57.458,01:27:59.125,They're here!
01:28:18.041,01:28:21.083,"-Oh, shit. -That's a big, big boy."
01:28:21.166,01:28:23.083,"This guy's bigger than your mom, Sean."
01:28:25.250,01:28:26.500,"Yeah, that's me."
01:28:34.125,01:28:36.208,-I get the first perk. -We want the perks.
01:28:38.416,01:28:40.916,"-Don't we, boys? Yeah? -We want the perks!"
01:28:47.208,01:28:49.625,"-Gentlemen, hi. -That's a good start. And hello to you."
01:29:06.500,01:29:07.708,My name is Casey.
01:29:34.916,01:29:35.750,All right.
01:29:36.625,01:29:37.541,Done.
01:29:37.833,01:29:39.208,Bullshit you're done.
01:29:39.291,01:29:40.750,"You've been here 20 minutes, what'd you do?"
01:29:43.416,01:29:45.166,"one in the middle, one down at the end."
01:29:50.333,01:29:52.041,What the fuck is that? Is that even a real word?
01:29:52.125,01:29:57.041,"Look, man, I want more of those things, the sideway diagonal things, like twice as many."
01:29:57.541,01:29:58.583,Those are gussets.
01:29:59.833,01:30:01.333,You got enough of 'em already.
01:30:02.041,01:30:05.708,"Okay, yeah. So, gussets I got out the ass, but a fishplate I need 'cause... What?"
01:30:05.791,01:30:07.416,I'm Catholic and it's Friday?
01:30:08.375,01:30:12.708,"You sure you couldn't just put a few more gussets up there, Neil?"
01:30:13.083,01:30:14.708,"I mean, what could it hurt, right?"
01:30:14.791,01:30:16.166,"Hey, it's your money."
01:30:16.250,01:30:18.041,"But what I just did, you don't even need that."
01:30:20.541,01:30:24.333,"Look, bro, I'm not like impugning on your precious welding skills."
01:30:25.208,01:30:28.708,"It's just we have a, uh, unique situation here."
01:30:38.541,01:30:40.375,Tried to rabbit on us once already.
01:30:41.791,01:30:44.458,I'm thinking he's gonna figure out a way to break this thing.
01:30:45.041,01:30:45.958,You kidding me?
01:30:46.541,01:30:47.416,Him?
01:30:47.666,01:30:50.958,"Yeah, it's just I kinda feel it flexing a little bit. A bit right here, look."
01:30:54.291,01:30:56.541,"Yeah, see? Right there. Yeah, a little bit."
01:30:59.666,01:31:01.541,That's four-inch channel iron up there.
01:31:01.625,01:31:05.791,You could hang an F150 from it and shove it back and forth like a beach ball.
01:31:05.875,01:31:06.875,It's going nowhere.
01:31:06.958,01:31:10.916,"Okay, you and your big four inches. It's just this little bastard's wiry."
01:31:11.000,01:31:14.000,I don't care how wiry he is. Have him knock himself out.
01:31:16.458,01:31:17.375,"Oh, yeah?"
01:31:18.000,01:31:19.666,Wanna put your money where your mouth is?
01:31:22.291,01:31:25.000,"Fifty bucks says he breaks this thing right here, right now."
01:31:25.083,01:31:30.708,"Fifty, plus, then you gotta put up more of those... What'd you call 'em, gussets?"
01:31:30.791,01:31:31.833,No charge.
01:31:32.166,01:31:34.208,"Throw in some fishplates too, while you're at it."
01:31:36.875,01:31:37.958,"-I'm on, huh? -Mm-hmm."
01:31:38.041,01:31:40.750,"All right, all right. Get that shit out the way and watch this."
01:31:41.375,01:31:42.625,"All right, good-lookin'."
01:31:42.875,01:31:45.125,This is it. This is the acid test.
01:31:45.875,01:31:46.750,Go for it.
01:31:52.416,01:31:54.166,Faster! Hit it hard!
01:31:55.833,01:31:57.541,"All right, all right. Other way, other way."
01:31:57.625,01:32:00.500,"Hey, what are you slowing down for? Hit it!"
01:32:04.125,01:32:06.791,I got 50 bucks riding on you. I gotta eat this month.
01:32:06.875,01:32:10.375,"Kenny, if he breaks his leg, he's not gonna be able to cook."
01:32:10.625,01:32:13.625,"What, are you the fucking HR department? Jesus, Toddie, relax."
01:32:14.458,01:32:16.541,We're gonna even up the odds a little bit.
01:32:18.333,01:32:19.250,All right.
01:32:19.333,01:32:20.708,Okay.
01:32:21.750,01:32:23.083,"Now, I believe in you."
01:32:23.333,01:32:25.416,"You're gonna John Henry this bitch, yeah?"
01:32:25.500,01:32:26.416,Now go.
01:32:26.583,01:32:28.375,"Go, go, go! Let's go!"
01:32:28.458,01:32:31.125,"Go, go, go, go! Yeah!"
01:32:33.916,01:32:36.958,"All right, other way. Faster! Hit it hard!"
01:32:37.041,01:32:38.250,"Yeah, baby!"
01:32:38.375,01:32:40.208,Yeah! Caught some air.
01:32:45.875,01:32:47.333,"Todd, who is this guy anyway?"
01:32:47.916,01:32:48.875,What'd he do?
01:32:49.583,01:32:50.458,Uh...
01:32:54.000,01:32:54.875,Yeah.
01:32:55.291,01:32:56.375,He's a rat.
01:33:37.416,01:33:38.708,and it's five past.
01:33:39.500,01:33:41.833,"Hell, I'll go another hour. Come on, we all will."
01:33:42.958,01:33:44.500,Where you going? Huh?
01:33:48.333,01:33:51.583,"Hey, Wanda!"
01:33:51.875,01:33:55.083,Wanda!
01:33:57.208,01:33:58.333,Ya Opie-lookin' self.
01:34:15.583,01:34:16.916,cuddle with my dog.
01:34:25.041,01:34:27.041,"Wake up, Clarence, let's go."
01:34:27.583,01:34:30.583,Look at my fucking shoes. I know. This is a mess.
01:34:32.791,01:34:35.125,It's gonna take me hours to get the mud out.
01:35:10.208,01:35:12.666,cocaine wasn't even invented when Brigham Young was born.
01:35:12.750,01:35:14.541,"It's okay, you can have some."
01:35:15.000,01:35:17.750,"Come on, come to papa. There we go."
01:35:23.541,01:35:25.083,He's all cocaine and Mormons.
01:36:02.666,01:36:03.583,What's up?
01:36:04.041,01:36:05.208,I need more money.
01:36:06.375,01:36:07.333,"Oh, yeah?"
01:36:08.500,01:36:11.500,That three-way split didn't quite cover it for me.
01:36:12.333,01:36:14.666,I'd appreciate you helping me out.
01:36:15.041,01:36:17.666,"Well, what's he talking about? Three-way split?"
01:36:17.750,01:36:20.000,You mean there was a third more?
01:36:20.083,01:36:21.250,And you gave it to him?
01:36:22.291,01:36:23.958,It's a long story.
01:36:26.041,01:36:27.250,What long story?
01:36:27.333,01:36:29.833,"When I left, he didn't even have a fucking gun."
01:36:29.916,01:36:31.625,"Well, he's got one now, doesn't he?"
01:36:32.208,01:36:34.750,"So, you know, shut up. Let me handle this."
01:36:34.958,01:36:36.541,"Neil, who the hell is this guy?"
01:36:36.625,01:36:40.958,"Yeah, I can't believe you just let him walk in here with-- Shut up means everybody."
01:36:45.333,01:36:49.750,"Now, how exactly do you plan on pulling this off?"
01:36:50.666,01:36:53.375,"I mean, being that there's five of us and one of you."
01:36:55.541,01:36:57.291,I'm not here to rob you.
01:37:00.458,01:37:01.666,Then how's this work?
01:37:04.375,01:37:05.833,"All I need is $1,800."
01:37:06.875,01:37:08.208,I'm asking as a...
01:37:08.875,01:37:09.708,a favor.
01:37:10.083,01:37:11.583,"Oh, what, like charity?"
01:37:11.666,01:37:15.291,"Seems to me this silly son of a bitch already forked over, big time."
01:37:15.375,01:37:17.250,"Casey, seriously, shut up."
01:37:18.625,01:37:20.250,"$1,800, huh?"
01:37:21.458,01:37:23.166,Why not an even two grand?
01:37:23.250,01:37:24.875,"You know, nice round number."
01:37:24.958,01:37:26.375,"$1,800 is all I need."
01:37:27.500,01:37:30.166,"So, what's the gun for? It's like personal protection?"
01:37:31.458,01:37:33.458,"I mean, is that a..."
01:37:35.000,01:37:37.541,What is that? Let me see that thing. Show me.
01:37:39.916,01:37:43.000,"Oh, my God, is that a .22?"
01:37:43.833,01:37:45.583,You brought a .22?
01:37:45.875,01:37:46.875,Jesus!
01:37:49.125,01:37:50.875,I think it was my grandfather's.
01:37:52.708,01:37:56.291,I know we got empty beer cans around here if you wanna do some plinking?
01:38:00.500,01:38:01.583,Eighteen hundred.
01:38:02.208,01:38:03.458,I'm gone forever.
01:38:04.166,01:38:05.333,Simple as that.
01:38:05.583,01:38:36.916,"Neil, I swear to God, if you give this piece of shit one more dollar-- Cold out here."
01:38:40.958,01:38:41.958,Tell you what.
01:38:44.333,01:38:48.125,My third is in a duffel bag in the top drawer of that file cabinet.
01:38:50.583,01:38:51.750,Where's yours?
01:38:54.583,01:38:55.625,In my car.
01:38:56.416,01:38:57.625,Parked up the street.
01:38:58.041,01:38:59.083,What do you say...
01:39:02.125,01:39:03.291,your .22...
01:39:03.958,01:39:05.458,against my .45?
01:39:07.250,01:39:08.416,Winner takes all.
01:39:12.375,01:39:13.833,Like the Wild West.
01:39:22.958,01:39:24.375,Jesus! Neil?
01:39:24.875,01:39:27.250,"-Come on, man, I didn't mean this-- -Casey."
01:39:27.833,01:39:30.333,Shut the fuck up.
01:39:36.041,01:39:36.916,Shoot!
01:39:41.583,01:39:42.625,You ready?
01:39:45.583,01:39:46.541,Yeah.
01:40:54.333,01:40:55.208,"Hey, don't shoot."
01:40:55.791,01:40:57.041,All right. Get over here.
01:40:57.541,01:40:59.541,"-Please. -All right, get up!"
01:41:04.000,01:41:04.833,All right.
01:41:05.666,01:41:06.791,Give me your license.
01:41:17.041,01:41:18.250,I got kids.
01:41:18.500,01:41:19.958,Like I give a shit.
01:41:21.208,01:41:22.083,All right.
01:41:22.708,01:41:27.291,"Sean, Kyle, Colin."
01:41:27.833,01:41:29.208,I know where you live.
01:41:30.000,01:41:35.416,"You tell the cops about me, and I am coming for every goddamn one of you."
01:41:42.208,01:41:43.041,Go.
01:41:43.916,01:41:44.916,Go!
01:41:51.416,01:41:52.708,"Dude, you're on fire."
01:43:23.291,01:43:24.666,Ah.
01:43:46.125,01:43:48.500,Yeah? Well...
01:43:49.250,01:43:50.750,do you miss me?
01:43:55.375,01:43:56.208,I don't know.
01:43:57.791,01:44:00.250,How you-- How are you gonna convince me?
01:45:02.041,01:45:03.583,"Yeah, bitch."
01:45:17.000,01:45:18.666,-Ah. -Thank you.
01:45:19.416,01:45:20.750,"Leave the pitcher, would ya?"
01:45:21.166,01:45:23.375,"-Sorry, can't really do that. -W-- wait."
01:45:28.083,01:45:28.916,Sure you can.
01:45:34.833,01:45:35.916,Wow.
01:45:36.333,01:45:39.166,"-It's like I'm here with Sinatra. -I know, right?"
01:45:42.041,01:45:44.083,Certainly went big with the pineapple.
01:45:47.250,01:45:48.375,Guessing you don't?
01:45:51.416,01:45:53.875,Pineapple's good for you. It's got bromide.
01:45:53.958,01:45:55.041,Bromelain.
01:45:55.625,01:45:56.833,"But, close."
01:45:58.208,01:46:00.041,"Actually, it's not close at all."
01:46:00.208,01:46:02.291,Are you gonna eat? You should really eat something.
01:46:02.375,01:46:03.875,"No, I'm eating. I'll eat."
01:46:03.958,01:46:05.458,"Gotta eat, gotta hydrate."
01:46:05.541,01:46:07.541,Get those electrolytes you were talking about.
01:46:07.625,01:46:09.833,"-Your sodium, you know, all that shit. -Good, yeah."
01:46:11.750,01:46:12.750,Yeah.
01:46:23.541,01:46:24.958,-You all right? -I'm fine. Good.
01:46:25.041,01:46:26.166,-Sit down. -All right.
01:46:42.541,01:46:44.625,How long will it take to sell this batch?
01:46:49.333,01:46:50.458,Easy. Maybe more.
01:46:51.000,01:46:53.541,There's no one that you can think of who might...
01:46:53.958,01:46:55.125,buy the entire amount?
01:46:55.208,01:46:58.666,"Uh, someone with a spare $1.3 million lying around? No."
01:46:59.208,01:47:00.500,Can't say that I do.
01:47:06.041,01:47:10.291,"Your family is gonna get every dime they got coming to them, Mr. White."
01:47:11.291,01:47:12.916,No matter how long it takes.
01:47:19.583,01:47:21.916,-Hydrate. Seriously. -Yeah.
01:47:39.291,01:47:41.333,Nothing? What about college?
01:47:42.958,01:47:46.458,"No, what is stopping you from going to college?"
01:47:47.000,01:47:47.958,Um...
01:47:49.250,01:47:51.500,"-Nothing, I guess. -Yeah, nothing at all."
01:47:55.250,01:47:57.666,"What would you study, you think, eh?"
01:47:58.208,01:47:59.166,What interests you?
01:48:02.250,01:48:03.416,Sports Medicine?
01:48:05.000,01:48:06.166,Sports Medicine.
01:48:06.583,01:48:07.416,Yeah.
01:48:08.666,01:48:11.000,"That's-- Yeah, sure. That's..."
01:48:13.625,01:48:16.416,Or... Business. Hm?
01:48:16.625,01:48:18.083,Business and Marketing.
01:48:19.083,01:48:21.666,You could practically teach that class.
01:48:21.916,01:48:24.375,"-Well, yeah. -I mean, you'd be a natural."
01:48:25.708,01:48:29.375,"And with a Business degree, I mean, that's handy anywhere."
01:48:34.708,01:48:36.000,You could do it too.
01:48:37.500,01:48:41.750,"First step, get your GED, that's no problem."
01:48:42.708,01:48:44.291,What do I need a GED for?
01:48:44.625,01:48:45.750,I got my diploma.
01:48:47.791,01:48:48.875,Oh.
01:48:49.583,01:48:51.875,"Of course, yeah, right. Right, right, right."
01:48:51.958,01:48:54.750,"Yo, you were standing right on stage when they handed it to me."
01:48:54.833,01:48:56.500,"I know, it just slipped my mind."
01:48:56.583,01:48:59.500,"I totally graduated high school, dick."
01:48:59.583,01:49:02.208,"-Which is no thanks to you, all right? -Just stay on the subject here."
01:49:02.291,01:49:03.166,All right?
01:49:03.375,01:49:05.583,The larger point being...
01:49:08.583,01:49:11.625,"You know, look, forget it. I-- I don't have a larger point."
01:49:18.333,01:49:19.333,Hm.
01:49:22.458,01:49:24.375,"You're really lucky, you know that?"
01:49:29.083,01:49:32.291,You didn't have to wait your whole life to do something special.
01:51:27.958,01:51:29.416,This is Alaska.
01:51:30.708,01:51:32.083,This is Alaska.
01:51:34.750,01:51:38.041,Forty miles in that direction gets you to Haines.
01:51:41.458,01:51:42.625,It's quiet.
01:51:45.500,01:51:47.333,Figured you could use some of that.
01:51:54.166,01:51:55.166,All right.
01:51:55.833,01:51:56.833,Date of birth?
01:52:00.125,01:52:01.833,-Mother's maiden name. -Stackhouse.
01:52:02.375,01:52:03.500,Where was she born?
01:52:03.916,01:52:06.500,"Kadena Air Force Base, Okinawa, Japan."
01:52:06.833,01:52:08.000,Father's date of birth.
01:52:08.375,01:52:10.000,02/07/51.
01:52:10.375,01:52:12.916,Your father's second to the last job.
01:52:14.375,01:52:17.958,"Claims adjuster, Dairyland Insurance, Appleton, Wisconsin."
01:52:18.041,01:52:19.833,What's your social security number?
01:52:23.208,01:52:24.083,Backward.
01:52:27.041,01:52:31.791,1496-81-141.
01:52:35.083,01:52:37.500,"Daylight's burning, you know where you're going."
01:52:37.625,01:52:38.708,Anything else?
01:52:44.583,01:52:45.875,Hold on a sec.
01:53:34.583,01:53:35.875,"Seal this up, please."
01:53:41.541,01:53:43.666,I'm going to Mexico City in about a month.
01:53:43.750,01:53:45.750,I'll mail it from there.
01:53:46.833,01:53:49.125,Anyone else you wanna say goodbye to?
01:53:51.708,01:53:54.458,Not many of us get a chance to start fresh.
01:53:55.916,01:53:57.916,"Good luck, Mr. Driscoll."
01:54:56.875,01:54:58.875,Going where the universe takes you?
01:54:59.833,01:55:00.875,Right on.
01:55:01.875,01:55:03.666,I think it's a cool philosophy.
01:55:05.291,01:55:08.000,I was being metaphorical. It's a terrible philosophy.
01:55:12.916,01:55:15.541,I've gone where the universe takes me my whole life.
01:55:18.208,01:55:20.625,It's better to make those decisions for yourself.
