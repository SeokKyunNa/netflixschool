00:01:20.959,00:01:23.333,How are the wife and kids?
00:01:23.375,00:01:28.375,"You know, for you, I'm considering treasury bonds and utility stocks."
00:01:28.417,00:01:34.000,"JARED: In the late '70s, banking wasn't a job you went into to make large sums of money."
00:01:34.041,00:01:35.750,It was a fucking snooze.
00:01:35.792,00:01:37.333,How about those Mets?
00:01:37.375,00:01:40.417,JARED: Filled with losers.
00:01:37.375,00:01:41.208,Like selling insurance or accounting.
00:01:41.250,00:01:46.542,"And if banking was boring, then the bond department at the bank was straight-up comatose."
00:01:46.583,00:01:48.083,We all know about bonds.
00:01:48.125,00:01:50.208,You give them to your snot-nosed kid when he turns 15.
00:01:50.250,00:01:52.250,Maybe when he's 30 he makes a hundred bucks.
00:01:52.291,00:01:53.542,Boring.
00:01:53.583,00:01:56.750,"That is, until Lewis Ranieri came on the scene at Salomon Brothers."
00:02:02.625,00:02:08.625,"You might not know who he is, but he changed your life more than Michael Jordan, the iPod and YouTube put together."
00:02:10.458,00:02:12.250,"All right, gentlemen!"
00:02:12.291,00:02:15.875,-Let's make some money!
00:02:15.917,00:02:20.750,"JARED: You see, Lewis didn't know it yet, but he had already changed banking forever with one simple idea."
00:02:22.166,00:02:27.291,The mortgage-backed security.
00:02:27.333,00:02:29.250,LEWIS: You've got your average person's mortgage.
00:02:29.291,00:02:30.417,"Fixed rate, 30 years."
00:02:30.458,00:02:42.875,"Boring, safe, small payoff, right? But, when you have thousands of them all bundled together, suddenly the yield goes up but the risk is still small because, well, they're mortgages!"
00:02:42.917,00:02:44.166,And who the hell doesn't pay their mortgage?
00:02:44.208,00:02:46.834,What exactly is the credit rating on this bond?
00:02:46.875,00:02:50.166,"This bond, gentlemen, is AAA-rated."
00:02:50.208,00:02:53.375,This is exactly what the Michigan state pension fund has been looking for.
00:02:53.417,00:02:54.959,I'll buy $20 million.
00:02:55.000,00:02:56.250,"Oh, come on, live a little."
00:02:56.291,00:02:57.959,-$25 million.
00:02:58.000,00:03:05.500,"JARED: The money came raining down, and for the first time, the banker went from the country club to the strip club."
00:03:08.083,00:03:11.375,"Pretty soon, stocks and savings were almost inconsequential."
00:03:11.417,00:03:13.709,"They were doing $50, $100, $200 billion Whoo!"
00:03:13.750,00:03:17.792,in mortgage bonds and dozens of other securities a year.
00:03:26.000,00:03:30.500,And America barely noticed as its number one industry became boring old banking.
00:03:34.083,00:03:40.667,"And then one day, almost 30 years later, in 2008, it all came crashing down."
00:03:43.709,00:03:48.250,FEMALE REPORTER: March. Bear Stearns was in a death spiral and the Fed brokered its sale.
00:03:48.291,00:03:51.417,BRIAN WILLIAMS: It's been called the worst financial crisis in modern times.
00:03:51.458,00:03:58.875,"Certainly the largest financial disaster in decades in this country, and perhaps the end of an era in American business."
00:03:58.917,00:04:05.333,"JARED: In the end, Lewis Ranieri's mortgage-backed security mutated into a monstrosity that collapsed the whole world economy."
00:04:05.375,00:04:08.583,And none of the experts or leaders or talking heads had a clue it was coming.
00:04:10.375,00:04:13.583,I'm guessing most of you still don't really know what happened.
00:04:13.625,00:04:15.875,"Yeah, you got a soundbite you repeat so you don't sound dumb, but come on."
00:04:15.917,00:04:19.041,Our financial institutions are strong.
00:04:20.208,00:04:22.667,But there were some who saw it coming.
00:04:22.709,00:04:28.125,"While the whole world was having a big old party, a few outsiders and weirdos saw what no one else could."
00:04:28.166,00:04:31.834,Not me. I'm not a weirdo.
00:04:31.875,00:04:34.333,But we'll meet again later.
00:04:34.375,00:04:37.166,These outsiders saw the giant lie at the heart of the economy.
00:04:37.208,00:04:42.417,And they saw it by doing something the rest of the suckers never thought to do.
00:04:42.458,00:04:43.875,They looked.
00:04:56.583,00:05:08.750,"MIKE: During the 1930s, the housing market collapsed nationwide by roughly 80%."
00:05:08.792,00:05:14.000,"I mean, half of all mortgage debt was in default."
00:05:14.041,00:05:21.417,"And, I mean, there were very specific identifiers, extremely recognizable."
00:05:24.166,00:05:32.500,"I mean, for instance, the hallmarks of mania is the rapid rise in complexity and the rates of fraud."
00:05:32.542,00:05:36.458,And did you know that they're going up?
00:05:39.792,00:05:40.875,MAN: Whoo!
00:05:55.417,00:05:59.542,MIKE: I've always been more comfortable alone.
00:06:06.750,00:06:11.500,I believe maybe it's because of my glass eye.
00:06:13.834,00:06:16.625,I lost the eye in a childhood illness.
00:06:20.917,00:06:23.333,It separates me from people.
00:06:27.291,00:06:30.875,And did you know that they are going up?
00:06:30.917,00:06:34.542,The highest fraud rates since the 1930s.
00:06:34.583,00:06:36.917,"MIKE'S MOM: Hey, hey, it's okay."
00:06:36.959,00:06:40.709,"No, I didn't know that."
00:06:43.166,00:06:47.458,"In 1933, the fourth year of the Great Depression."
00:06:47.500,00:06:49.250,Let's wash it off and put it back in.
00:06:49.291,00:06:51.291,"MIKE'S DAD: You were playing so great, son."
00:06:51.333,00:06:53.458,I even heard the coach say it.
00:06:54.500,00:06:56.500,Can we just go home?
00:06:56.542,00:07:01.041,MIKE: Most social interactions are awkward for me and for the person.
00:07:01.083,00:07:05.625,"Even when I try to compliment someone, it comes out wrong."
00:07:07.041,00:07:10.917,You have a very nice haircut.
00:07:23.875,00:07:25.792,I'm sorry. I'm just...
00:07:31.458,00:07:32.542,I'm going on and on.
00:07:32.583,00:07:34.417,My wife told me I need to share more.
00:07:34.458,00:07:35.542,Mmm.
00:07:36.417,00:07:38.291,That seems healthy.
00:07:38.333,00:07:39.417,Mmm-hmm.
00:07:48.834,00:07:49.917,Uh...
00:07:51.000,00:07:52.458,So do I get the job?
00:07:52.500,00:07:54.917,I really think I could help your fund.
00:07:56.250,00:07:57.625,Yeah.
00:07:57.667,00:07:59.417,"Yeah, sure. Go on."
00:08:02.000,00:08:03.667,You're...
00:08:03.709,00:08:05.291,David. Great.
00:08:05.333,00:08:07.250,I guess I'll go find a desk.
00:08:07.291,00:08:10.333,Is there anything you want me to work on for start...
00:08:10.375,00:08:11.458,Uh...
00:08:12.917,00:08:14.333,Yeah.
00:08:14.375,00:08:16.333,DAVID: You could let me know later.
00:08:18.834,00:08:34.458,"Did you think it was strange when, um, the tech bubble burst in 2001 and the housing market in San Jose, the tech capital of the world, went up?"
00:08:34.500,00:08:35.458,Wasn't that strange?
00:08:35.500,00:08:36.709,DAVID: No.
00:08:36.750,00:08:39.291,"No, it's housing."
00:08:39.333,00:08:40.375,Low risk. It's solid.
00:08:40.417,00:08:42.458,"That's the idea, yeah."
00:08:42.500,00:08:47.542,I want you to get me the top 20 selling mortgage bonds.
00:08:47.583,00:08:50.500,So you want to know what the top 20 selling mortgage bonds are?
00:08:50.542,00:08:56.250,"No, no, no, I want to know what mortgages are in each one."
00:08:56.291,00:08:59.291,mortgages made up of...
00:08:59.333,00:09:03.000,"Wait, aren't those bonds made up of thousands and thousands of mortgages?"
00:09:03.041,00:09:04.500,Yeah.
00:09:08.500,00:09:10.083,"DAVID: Right away, Dr. Burry."
00:09:29.083,00:09:33.417,I am a nice guy all day long.
00:09:33.458,00:09:36.208,"Ask anyone, I'm a pleasure to work with."
00:09:38.125,00:09:43.083,"But the second my son screws up, I am..."
00:09:43.125,00:09:45.667,...yelling at him just like my dad did to me.
00:09:48.917,00:09:51.667,I hear the words that are coming out of my mouth and...
00:09:51.709,00:09:55.125,MARK: Sorry I'm late! No cabs.
00:09:55.166,00:09:56.125,Oh...
00:09:56.625,00:09:57.625,"So, get this."
00:09:59.000,00:10:01.750,I met with this retail banker yesterday.
00:10:01.792,00:10:13.041,"I'm supposed to be getting him to invest in a fund, but instead I start grilling him about overdraft penalties and how his bank will let a customer write 10-12 checks before they tell them they're overdrawn."
00:10:13.083,00:10:17.041,And this creep is making billions off screwing over people this way.
00:10:17.083,00:10:18.917,And I'm getting madder and madder.
00:10:18.959,00:10:28.250,"And I ask him, I look him in the face and I say, How can you sleep at night knowing that you are ripping off working people?"
00:10:28.291,00:10:29.750,And you know what he did?
00:10:29.792,00:10:32.792,"He just walks out of the lunch, doesn't say a word."
00:10:32.834,00:10:33.917,What the fuck is that?
00:10:33.959,00:10:36.291,Who's fucked up in that scenario? Am I?
00:10:36.333,00:10:38.834,"Or is this douchebag, who leaves me hanging?"
00:10:38.875,00:10:40.000,Is he the fucked up one?
00:10:40.041,00:10:43.125,We have talked about this numerous times.
00:10:43.166,00:10:46.333,You can't come in late and hijack the entire session.
00:10:46.375,00:10:47.834,MARK: What do you mean?
00:10:47.875,00:10:49.083,Did I hijack the session?
00:10:49.125,00:10:50.166,Yeah.
00:10:50.709,00:10:51.959,What do you do?
00:10:52.000,00:10:53.125,MAN: I'm in commodities.
00:10:53.166,00:10:54.542,Good luck with that.
00:10:54.583,00:10:58.250,"THERAPIST: Mark, I know you suffered a terrible loss."
00:10:58.291,00:10:59.458,Maybe you want to talk about that.
00:10:59.500,00:11:00.834,I don't talk about that.
00:11:00.875,00:11:02.333,Hold on.
00:11:02.375,00:11:03.500,Hold on...
00:11:03.542,00:11:07.542,"Shit, I have to take this."
00:11:07.583,00:11:09.709,"I don't care, Porter."
00:11:09.750,00:11:11.417,This guy's whole business is built on ripping people off.
00:11:11.458,00:11:13.125,How long can that last?
00:11:14.500,00:11:15.750,"Bye, everybody!"
00:11:18.667,00:11:20.834,That's 30 days late...
00:11:23.208,00:11:25.750,They pay on time...
00:11:28.625,00:11:30.333,These FICO scores...
00:11:36.875,00:11:39.041,Late. And they caught up on their payments...
00:11:39.083,00:11:40.667,Another 30 days late...
00:11:40.709,00:11:43.959,"LTV, 95... LTV, 90..."
00:11:44.000,00:11:45.542,Sixty days late? Jesus!
00:11:45.583,00:11:47.750,"LTV, 110?"
00:11:47.792,00:11:49.208,"Thirty days late, rate adjusts..."
00:11:50.208,00:11:51.417,In '07 rate adjusts...
00:11:51.458,00:11:52.709,In '06 rate adjusts...
00:11:52.750,00:11:55.083,95... 90... Jesus!
00:11:56.709,00:11:58.375,He hasn't moved all day.
00:11:58.417,00:12:00.792,He does this every few days.
00:12:00.834,00:12:02.542,He hasn't spoken to me since he hired me.
00:12:02.583,00:12:04.041,MIKE: Maybe the LTV's at...
00:12:02.583,00:12:09.125,"High-risk, interest-only... I never heard of that mortgage history, I never heard of that... How?"
00:12:09.166,00:12:10.583,"Michael, how are you, guy?"
00:12:10.625,00:12:13.750,"MIKE: Lawrence, I found something really interesting."
00:12:13.792,00:12:17.041,"Great, Michael. Whenever you find something interesting, we all tend to make money."
00:12:17.083,00:12:18.542,What stock are you valuing?
00:12:18.583,00:12:19.959,"No, no, no, no. No stocks."
00:12:20.000,00:12:22.166,I want to short the housing market.
00:12:23.458,00:12:26.583,Really? But the housing market is rock solid.
00:12:26.625,00:12:30.750,"Greenspan just said bubbles are regional, defaults are rare."
00:12:30.792,00:12:32.959,Tell them I'll be there in a minute.
00:12:33.000,00:12:34.834,-Say again?
00:12:36.667,00:12:42.458,"I don't think you mean to do this, but sometimes you sound very dismissive and superior."
00:12:42.500,00:12:43.875,It's a fact.
00:12:43.917,00:12:46.291,how else you want me to say...
00:12:46.333,00:12:47.458,"Look, Michael."
00:12:47.500,00:12:53.750,Metro Capital backed you four years ago when you were a doctor with a dinky webpage and some inheritance money.
00:12:53.792,00:12:54.834,We've all done very well.
00:12:54.875,00:12:55.750,Why don't you just stick with stocks?
00:12:55.792,00:12:58.333,"Look. You know me. I, I, I..."
00:12:58.375,00:13:02.041,I look for value wherever it can be found.
00:13:02.083,00:13:10.166,And the fact is that these mortgage-backed securities are filled with extremely risky subprime adjustable-rate loans.
00:13:10.208,00:13:16.417,"And when the majority of the adjustable rates kick in, in '07, they will begin to fail."
00:13:16.458,00:13:19.834,"And if they fail above 15%, the whole bond is worthless."
00:13:19.875,00:13:22.125,"Michael, just take a beat."
00:13:22.166,00:13:23.458,"We'll talk about this later, okay?"
00:13:23.500,00:13:26.500,"Lawrence, please, don't patronize me. Listen..."
00:13:26.542,00:13:28.125,JARED: Mortgage-backed securities.
00:13:28.166,00:13:29.250,"It, it, it..."
00:13:29.291,00:13:31.375,Subprime loans. Tranches.
00:13:31.417,00:13:33.166,"It's pretty confusing, right?"
00:13:33.208,00:13:35.834,Does it make you feel bored?
00:13:35.875,00:13:38.208,"Well, it's supposed to."
00:13:38.250,00:13:42.959,Wall Street loves to use confusing terms to make you think only they can do what they do.
00:13:43.000,00:13:45.875,"Or, even better, for you to just leave them the fuck alone."
00:13:45.917,00:13:49.875,So here's Margot Robbie in a bubble bath to explain.
00:13:49.917,00:13:55.375,"Basically, Lewis Ranieri's mortgage bonds were amazingly profitable for the big banks."
00:13:55.417,00:14:01.709,They made billions and billions on their 2% fee they got for selling each of these bonds.
00:14:01.750,00:14:05.208,But then they started running out of mortgages to put in them.
00:14:05.250,00:14:11.792,"After all, there are only so many homes and so many people with good enough jobs to buy them, right?"
00:14:11.834,00:14:15.959,So the banks started filling these bonds with riskier and riskier mortgages.
00:14:16.041,00:14:17.542,"Thank you, Benter."
00:14:17.583,00:14:22.041,"That way they can keep that profit machine churning, right?"
00:14:22.083,00:14:26.583,"By the way, these risky mortgages are called subprime."
00:14:26.625,00:14:30.583,"So whenever you hear subprime, think shit."
00:14:30.625,00:14:40.792,Our friend Michael Burry found out that these mortgage bonds that were supposedly 65% AAA were actually just mostly full of shit.
00:14:40.834,00:14:43.625,So now he's going to short the bonds.
00:14:43.667,00:14:46.500,Which means to bet against.
00:14:46.542,00:14:47.667,Got it?
00:14:48.291,00:14:49.625,Good.
00:14:52.625,00:14:53.917,Now fuck off.
00:14:53.959,00:14:55.959,It's only a matter of time before someone else sees this investment.
00:14:56.000,00:14:58.125,We have to act now!
00:14:58.166,00:15:00.458,How do you know the bonds are worthless?
00:15:00.500,00:15:03.959,Aren't they filled with fucking thousands of pages of mortgages?
00:15:04.000,00:15:06.333,I read them.
00:15:06.375,00:15:08.333,- You read them?
00:15:08.375,00:15:10.000,No one reads them.
00:15:08.375,00:15:11.625,Only the lawyers who put them together read them.
00:15:11.667,00:15:16.458,"Look, I don't think that they even know what they've made."
00:15:16.500,00:15:24.875,"The housing market is propped up on these It's a time bomb, and I want to short it."
00:15:24.917,00:15:27.250,"Through what instrument, Michael?"
00:15:27.291,00:15:30.333,There are no insurance contracts or options for mortgage bonds.
00:15:30.375,00:15:31.750,The bonds are too stable.
00:15:31.792,00:15:33.125,Lawrence...
00:15:36.375,00:15:40.500,This is what I'm gonna do.
00:15:36.375,00:15:42.709,I am gonna get a bank to make me one.
00:15:43.208,00:15:47.625,And then I'm gonna buy it.
00:15:47.667,00:15:50.667,MARK: I don't want that kind of business.
00:15:50.709,00:15:54.000,Money is not money.
00:15:54.041,00:15:56.291,Hey! Excuse me!
00:15:57.667,00:16:02.709,Let me ask you this. What company treats its customers that shittily and succeeds?
00:16:04.083,00:16:05.959,"Fine. Okay, Goldman."
00:16:06.000,00:16:11.250,JARED: Mark Baum had built his career on never assuming anyone or any company was legit without proving it.
00:16:11.291,00:16:15.000,When he was a kid he excelled at studying the Talmud in Yeshiva.
00:16:15.041,00:16:16.542,But one day his rabbi told his mom why.
00:16:18.083,00:16:23.834,"Paul is a fine boy, and Mark is an excellent student of the Torah and the Talmud."
00:16:23.875,00:16:25.875,"Then what's the problem, Rabbi?"
00:16:25.917,00:16:29.875,It's the reason Mark is studying so hard.
00:16:29.917,00:16:33.208,He's looking for inconsistencies in the word of God!
00:16:35.917,00:16:37.709,-So has he found any?
00:16:39.333,00:16:42.417,"JARED : Later, Baum started his own fund on Wall Street."
00:16:42.458,00:16:43.959,He had an amazing nose for bullshit.
00:16:44.000,00:16:48.667,And he wasn't afraid to let anyone know when and where the bull had gone number two.
00:16:48.709,00:16:54.333,"But then a tragedy happened to Mark, and it turned his world view dark and ready to believe the whole system was a lie."
00:16:54.375,00:16:55.792,Hold on.
00:16:55.834,00:16:59.792,It's Cynthia.
00:16:59.834,00:17:01.041,"Hi, Honey."
00:17:02.291,00:17:06.542,The therapist called.
00:17:06.583,00:17:09.375,There were no cabs.
00:17:09.417,00:17:11.083,"I worry about you, Mark."
00:17:11.125,00:17:12.542,At least I went.
00:17:13.792,00:17:17.709,You're running around like you have to right -every wrong in the world.
00:17:17.750,00:17:19.041,You're so angry.
00:17:19.083,00:17:20.166,Fine. You know what?
00:17:20.208,00:17:23.542,I'm a mean guy and I'm pissed off.
00:17:23.583,00:17:25.500,"But it is a shit storm out here, sweetie."
00:17:25.542,00:17:28.875,You have no idea the kind of crap people are pulling.
00:17:28.917,00:17:31.625,And everyone's walking around like they're in a goddamn Enya video.
00:17:33.250,00:17:34.792,"They're all getting screwed, you know."
00:17:34.834,00:17:37.417,You know what they care about?
00:17:37.458,00:17:40.375,Or they care about what actress just went into rehab.
00:17:40.417,00:17:42.583,I think you should try medication.
00:17:42.625,00:17:45.834,"No, no. We agreed."
00:17:45.875,00:17:48.166,You hate Wall Street.
00:17:48.208,00:17:50.208,-I love my job.
00:17:50.250,00:17:51.250,I love my job.
00:17:51.291,00:17:52.333,You're miserable.
00:17:52.375,00:17:55.250,I love my job.
00:17:55.291,00:17:56.709,Mark...
00:17:57.792,00:18:00.917,I am sad every day about what happened.
00:18:00.959,00:18:04.375,"I know you must feel the same, but you never show it."
00:18:10.583,00:18:13.166,I know how close you were to your brother.
00:18:16.458,00:18:17.583,MARK: Paul.
00:18:18.583,00:18:20.250,"Where'd you go, Paul?"
00:18:25.500,00:18:26.834,Paul!
00:18:32.375,00:18:35.458,"Every day I think you're gonna talk about it, but you never do."
00:18:39.208,00:18:42.834,Will you at least think about the idea of making a change?
00:18:42.875,00:18:45.792,"Fine. Fine. Honey, you know what?"
00:18:45.834,00:18:49.250,"But, honestly, Cynthia."
00:18:49.291,00:18:51.291,"Hey, hey, hey! No, no."
00:18:51.333,00:18:54.750,My cab. That's my cab.
00:18:54.792,00:18:55.917,MARK: Schmuck. Fuck you.
00:18:55.959,00:18:58.000,MARK: Fuck you.
00:18:59.125,00:19:00.709,I'll call you later.
00:19:08.000,00:19:12.166,I want to buy swaps on mortgage bonds.
00:19:12.208,00:19:18.875,A credit default swap that will pay off if the underlying bond fails.
00:19:18.917,00:19:20.458,You want to bet against the housing market?
00:19:20.500,00:19:22.375,-Yes.
00:19:22.417,00:19:26.291,Those bonds only fail if millions of Americans don't pay their mortgages.
00:19:26.333,00:19:28.750,That's never happened in history.
00:19:28.792,00:19:31.750,"If you'll excuse me, Dr. Burry, it seems like a foolish investment."
00:19:31.792,00:19:39.083,"Well, based on prevailing sentiment of the market and banks in popular culture, yes, it's a foolish investment."
00:19:39.125,00:19:41.709,"But, uh..."
00:19:43.250,00:19:44.834,That's a good one.
00:19:47.458,00:19:48.792,"This is Wall Street, Dr. Burry."
00:19:48.834,00:19:50.041,"If you offer us free money, we are going to take it."
00:19:50.083,00:20:04.000,"My one concern is that when the bonds fail, uh, I want to be certain, um, of payment um, in case of solvency issues with your bank."
00:20:04.041,00:20:06.417,"I'm sorry, are you for real?"
00:20:06.458,00:20:09.583,You wanna bet against the housing market and you're worried we won't pay you?
00:20:09.625,00:20:11.208,"Yes, that's correct."
00:20:22.500,00:20:24.083,...unless the market crashes.
00:20:24.125,00:20:29.667,The market on housing's never gonna crash because it's so solid right now.
00:20:29.709,00:20:32.542,"I mean, who doesn't pay their mortgages?"
00:20:36.417,00:20:37.500,Mmm-hmm.
00:20:39.667,00:20:45.291,"Dr. Burry, we could work out a pay-as-we-go structure that would pay out if the bonds fail."
00:20:45.333,00:20:48.917,But it would also apply to your payments if the value of the mortgage bond goes up.
00:20:48.959,00:20:51.709,You'd have to pay us monthly premiums.
00:20:51.750,00:20:54.500,"LUCY: Is that acceptable, Dr. Burry?"
00:20:56.834,00:20:57.834,Yes. Yes.
00:20:59.083,00:21:04.709,"Um, I have prospectuses on six mortgage-backed securities I want to short."
00:21:09.208,00:21:11.458,Majority of the mortgages...
00:21:22.166,00:21:24.709,I don't see us losing any money on these at all.
00:21:38.125,00:21:40.792,"Dr. Burry, these should be fine."
00:21:40.834,00:21:45.959,Yeah. We're prepared to sell you $5 million in credit default swaps on these mortgage bonds.
00:21:46.000,00:21:47.458,Can we make it $100 million?
00:21:50.250,00:21:52.750,"Uh, absolutely, we can make it $100 million."
00:21:54.208,00:21:58.250,"LUCY: We'll be in touch, send some paperwork over."
00:21:58.291,00:21:59.375,DEEB: Um...
00:22:01.875,00:22:03.542,Can I take one for my son?
00:22:03.583,00:22:05.458,LUCY: Have... Yes. Yes.
00:22:05.500,00:22:07.041,Thank you.
00:22:07.083,00:22:08.500,LUCY: Have two.
00:22:28.417,00:22:31.500,Is there any way to do $200 million?
00:22:32.875,00:22:36.375,"I mean, we can."
00:22:36.417,00:22:39.667,"Absolutely. Absolutely, we can do that."
00:22:53.291,00:22:56.750,We do different projects.
00:22:56.792,00:22:58.500,The bonds I'd like to bet against.
00:23:00.208,00:23:01.709,It's not bad seeing yourself on the big screen.
00:23:01.750,00:23:02.667,It's very cool.
00:23:04.000,00:23:07.542,"I ordered the 24-ounce T-bone, which was choice."
00:23:07.583,00:23:09.041,I went for volume...
00:23:09.083,00:23:10.792,...rather than prime.
00:23:10.834,00:23:13.583,"I went for subprime, and the gist was..."
00:23:21.375,00:23:23.083,"MAN: Can I have like, lettuce, tomato, no onions?"
00:23:23.125,00:23:27.333,"WOMAN: So, no onions. Lettuce, tomato, Thousand Island okay?"
00:23:27.375,00:23:28.458,MAN: Yeah.
00:23:35.458,00:23:37.208,"Hey, Randall!"
00:23:37.250,00:23:38.875,Bonuses aren't for three months.
00:23:38.917,00:23:43.166,We just sold $200 million in credit swaps for mortgage bonds.
00:23:43.208,00:23:45.458,Some fund manager from California.
00:23:45.500,00:23:46.542,"It's fucking crazy, right?"
00:23:46.583,00:23:48.041,"A whole new way to make money, Doug."
00:23:48.083,00:23:50.417,"Wait, wait. I didn't know there were swaps on mortgages."
00:23:50.458,00:23:53.083,We made it for him.
00:23:53.125,00:23:54.834,He must have gone off his Zoloft or something.
00:23:54.875,00:23:56.291,I don't know.
00:23:56.333,00:23:58.125,-Want to join? No?
00:23:58.166,00:23:59.291,Oh...
00:23:59.333,00:24:00.667,"DOUG: Hey, Jared."
00:24:00.709,00:24:03.625,Did you hear about the deal that Randall just did with some fund manager?
00:24:03.667,00:24:05.834,JARED: Randall? Bullshit.
00:24:05.875,00:24:07.792,He's a foot soldier.
00:24:07.834,00:24:09.125,"No, it's for real."
00:24:10.041,00:24:11.709,I told you we'd meet later.
00:24:11.750,00:24:14.250,"Unfortunately, it's in a place like this which I would never be."
00:24:14.291,00:24:17.041,"I never hung out with these idiots after work, ever."
00:24:17.083,00:24:19.208,I had fashion friends.
00:24:19.250,00:24:22.625,"Apparently, this guy wanted $200 mil in credit default swaps."
00:24:22.667,00:24:24.458,Randall made the sale.
00:24:24.500,00:24:26.750,Somebody shorted $200 mil on mortgage bonds?
00:24:26.792,00:24:31.000,That was just with Deutsche.
00:24:31.041,00:24:32.208,How much in total?
00:24:32.250,00:24:33.917,$1.3 billion.
00:24:33.959,00:24:37.959,LAWRENCE: What? That's pretty much all of Scion's liquidity.
00:24:38.000,00:24:40.166,"Michael, this is highly distressing."
00:24:40.208,00:24:44.291,"Lawrence, that is not all of our liquidity."
00:24:44.333,00:24:47.875,And I'm not certain that you really understand this trade.
00:24:47.917,00:24:49.041,This is a certainty.
00:24:49.083,00:24:52.208,"Mike, I consider myself a mentor to you."
00:24:52.250,00:24:56.083,But our company is not comfortable with this investment.
00:24:56.125,00:25:01.208,"Lawrence, I have full autonomy when it comes to investment strategy."
00:25:01.250,00:25:02.792,read our agreement.
00:25:02.834,00:25:05.333,"Do not throw our inception agreement in my face, Michael."
00:25:05.375,00:25:09.875,We had an underlying understanding you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man.
00:25:09.917,00:25:11.542,This is not crazy.
00:25:11.583,00:25:12.792,It's all very logical.
00:25:12.834,00:25:18.709,"So, now we pay up premiums on these swaps against the housing market until the mortgages fail?"
00:25:18.750,00:25:23.333,"In other words, we lose millions until something that's never happened before happens?"
00:25:27.125,00:25:28.208,That's correct.
00:26:01.625,00:26:02.917,"KATHY: Hello, Mark Baum."
00:26:02.959,00:26:05.083,"Oh, hey, Kathy, you busted me."
00:26:05.125,00:26:05.792,I had a personal thing this afternoon.
00:26:05.834,00:26:07.291,I'm not your babysitter.
00:26:07.333,00:26:09.959,"If FrontPoint makes money for Morgan Stanley, I'm happy."
00:26:10.000,00:26:12.333,"Okay. Hey, did I hear you're expecting?"
00:26:12.375,00:26:13.834,We're expecting to be expecting.
00:26:13.875,00:26:15.583,IVF's are cleaning us out but we're staying positive...
00:26:15.625,00:26:17.208,That's exciting!
00:26:21.250,00:26:23.750,...lump on my ball.
00:26:23.792,00:26:25.375,Mmm-hmm.
00:26:25.417,00:26:29.166,Turns out that I have a very large thing called an epididymis.
00:26:29.208,00:26:33.500,Which is a thing that goes around the ball and is like a sac underneath.
00:26:33.542,00:26:36.041,I have an extremely -pronounced epididymis.
00:26:36.083,00:26:38.792,I'm riveted by this.
00:26:38.834,00:26:42.417,DANNY: It's almost as large as another testicle unto itself.
00:26:42.458,00:26:44.375,So get this. Cynthia...
00:26:44.417,00:26:48.917,Guys. Cynthia wants me to quit and open a B&amp;B in Vermont.
00:26:48.959,00:26:50.709,That sounds great.
00:26:48.959,00:26:52.417,I'd love to see Mark Baum run a bed and breakfast.
00:26:52.458,00:26:54.417,"Like, Here's your steel-cut oatmeal, asshole."
00:26:54.458,00:27:00.250,"JARED: Mark refused to kiss the ring of the people with the checkbooks, so he had to set up his fund under Morgan Stanley's umbrella."
00:27:00.291,00:27:04.000,- His small team reflected his distrust of the system.
00:27:04.041,00:27:05.542,You guys are sick.
00:27:05.583,00:27:07.792,She says this job is making me unhappy.
00:27:07.834,00:27:08.917,VINNIE: But you're happy when you're unhappy.
00:27:08.959,00:27:10.458,I am happy when I'm unhappy.
00:27:10.500,00:27:11.333,JARED: Vinnie Daniel.
00:27:11.375,00:27:12.709,You know how to make a muffin?
00:27:12.750,00:27:13.875,- Mark's numbers guy.
00:27:12.750,00:27:16.959,-Do you even know how to do laundry? Make a bed?
00:27:17.000,00:27:18.834,Vinnie lost his father to a violent crime when he was young.
00:27:18.875,00:27:20.417,"Just like Mark, he didn't talk about it."
00:27:20.458,00:27:22.125,I don't talk about that.
00:27:22.166,00:27:24.500,Cynthia's no joke.
00:27:24.542,00:27:26.208,"I mean, she made me start wearing a seatbelt."
00:27:26.250,00:27:28.083,"-Hey, you want me to..."
00:27:28.125,00:27:30.333,Former Olympic rower who went to Brown.
00:27:30.375,00:27:34.125,He worked with Baum at a previous firm and couldn't figure out why no one listened to Baum.
00:27:34.166,00:27:36.250,The guy with all the good ideas.
00:27:36.291,00:27:38.208,Sorry. I think you have the wrong FrontPoint.
00:27:38.250,00:27:40.917,'Cause there is another FrontPoint in this same building that is bonds.
00:27:40.959,00:27:44.291,And Danny Moses.
00:27:44.333,00:27:46.166,And a hell of a trader.
00:27:46.208,00:27:49.000,Which is the only reason they put up with his bullshit optimism.
00:27:49.041,00:27:50.500,DANNY: That was a weird call.
00:27:50.542,00:27:53.834,You take longer with a wrong number than anybody else.
00:27:53.875,00:27:59.333,It was this guy from Deutsche who was talking about shorting housing bonds.
00:28:00.583,00:28:03.166,And then in the middle of the call I realized he had the wrong FrontPoint.
00:28:03.208,00:28:06.125,And then... 'Cause he wanted the one on the 8th floor.
00:28:06.166,00:28:08.041,He wanted to short housing bonds?
00:28:08.083,00:28:10.750,Uh-huh. That happens like five times a day that somebody gets the wrong FrontPoint.
00:28:10.792,00:28:11.917,We should change our name.
00:28:11.959,00:28:12.917,VINNIE: Wait. Wait.
00:28:12.959,00:28:15.291,He wanted to short housing bonds?
00:28:15.333,00:28:18.083,Who bets against housing?
00:28:18.125,00:28:19.125,VINNIE: What's the ABX at?
00:28:19.166,00:28:20.667,What's ABX?
00:28:20.709,00:28:23.917,It tracks subprime mortgage bond value. Go back to sleep.
00:28:23.959,00:28:26.291,"The ABX is at, uh..."
00:28:26.333,00:28:29.667,"Wow, it's down! It's down three points since last year."
00:28:29.709,00:28:31.959,That's weird. I haven't heard a peep about that.
00:28:32.000,00:28:33.041,What was this guy's name?
00:28:33.083,00:28:35.291,Jared Vennett. Vennett.
00:28:35.333,00:28:37.041,JARED: That's right.
00:28:35.333,00:28:41.959,These lucky sons of bitches caught wind of one of the best trades in Wall Street history from a wrong number.
00:28:42.000,00:28:44.500,They should have paid 10% to my fuckstick assistant.
00:28:44.542,00:28:46.917,DANNY: His name was Jared Vennett. Vennett.
00:28:46.959,00:28:48.917,Jared Vennett from Deutsche.
00:28:48.959,00:28:50.667,VINNIE: Sounds like a douchebag.
00:28:50.709,00:28:52.583,Do you smell that?
00:28:52.625,00:28:54.000,Do you smell that?
00:28:54.041,00:28:55.291,I smell money.
00:28:56.125,00:28:57.583,This is your basic mortgage...
00:29:01.333,00:29:03.709,"Okay, hi. How are you?"
00:29:03.750,00:29:05.291,Have a seat.
00:29:05.333,00:29:08.208,"MARK: Okay, Mr. Vennett from Deutsche Bank."
00:29:12.667,00:29:14.250,There you go.
00:29:17.667,00:29:20.250,"MARK: So, how many people have you talked to about this trade?"
00:29:20.291,00:29:23.083,A few. There's definitely some interest.
00:29:23.125,00:29:24.625,-No!
00:29:24.667,00:29:26.125,-N.O.!
00:29:26.166,00:29:27.083,-Get lost.
00:29:28.583,00:29:31.291,"Which is why you're here talking to us, a wrong number."
00:29:31.333,00:29:32.792,Sounds like there's a lot of interest.
00:29:32.834,00:29:37.667,All right. A few people have invited us in just to laugh at me on this deal.
00:29:37.709,00:29:38.583,Is that what this is?
00:29:38.625,00:29:39.834,VINNIE: That's not what this is.
00:29:39.875,00:29:41.750,That's just how Mark is.
00:29:41.792,00:29:43.125,Let's see what you got.
00:29:43.166,00:29:44.875,You smell that? What is that?
00:29:44.917,00:29:46.750,MARK: What?
00:29:46.792,00:29:47.875,Your cologne?
00:29:47.917,00:29:49.000,JARED: No.
00:29:51.208,00:29:52.542,Opportunity.
00:29:52.583,00:29:53.917,No. Money.
00:29:53.959,00:29:55.333,-Oh...
00:29:55.375,00:29:57.333,-I smell money.
00:29:57.375,00:29:58.709,"Chris, God damn it."
00:29:58.750,00:30:00.125,Sorry.
00:30:03.208,00:30:05.667,JARED: This is your basic mortgage bond.
00:30:05.709,00:30:08.000,All right?
00:30:08.041,00:30:13.667,"They were just thousands of AAA mortgages bundled together, guaranteed by the U.S. government."
00:30:13.709,00:30:15.250,The modern ones are different.
00:30:15.291,00:30:18.625,They're private. And they're made up of layers of tranches.
00:30:23.750,00:30:26.208,"The highest level, AAA, is getting paid first."
00:30:26.250,00:30:29.458,"The lowest rated, B, is getting paid last, taking on defaults first."
00:30:29.500,00:30:32.250,"Now, obviously, if you're buying B's, you could make more money."
00:30:32.291,00:30:33.542,But they're a little risky.
00:30:33.583,00:30:35.834,Sometimes they fail.
00:30:36.959,00:30:38.333,Chris?
00:30:42.083,00:30:48.417,"Somewhere along the line, these B's and BB's went from a little risky to dog shit."
00:30:48.458,00:30:49.834,PORTER: It's right behind you.
00:30:49.875,00:30:52.792,I'm talking rock-bottom FICO scores.
00:30:53.959,00:30:55.542,No income verification.
00:30:56.417,00:30:59.542,Adjustable rates. Dog shit!
00:31:00.959,00:31:03.875,"The default rates are already up from 1% to 4%, fellas."
00:31:03.917,00:31:09.208,"And if they rise to 8%, and they will, a lot of these BBB's are going to zero, too."
00:31:09.250,00:31:10.709,And that... You're too close.
00:31:12.083,00:31:13.000,...is an opportunity.
00:31:13.792,00:31:15.500,MARK: Okay.
00:31:15.542,00:31:18.250,You're saying that at 8% the bonds fail and we are already at 4%?
00:31:18.291,00:31:19.250,That's right.
00:31:19.291,00:31:21.166,"If they go to 8%, it's Armageddon?"
00:31:21.208,00:31:22.291,Yeah. That's right.
00:31:22.333,00:31:24.083,How come nobody's talking about this?
00:31:24.125,00:31:26.333,You're completely sure of the math?
00:31:26.375,00:31:28.959,Look at him. That's my quant.
00:31:29.000,00:31:30.083,MARK: Your what?
00:31:30.125,00:31:31.959,My quantitative!
00:31:32.000,00:31:34.750,My math specialist.
00:31:34.792,00:31:37.125,You notice anything different about him?
00:31:37.166,00:31:38.417,MARK: That's pretty racist.
00:31:38.458,00:31:40.959,JARED: Look at his eyes!
00:31:41.000,00:31:42.166,His name's Yang!
00:31:43.667,00:31:47.041,He won a national math competition in China!
00:31:47.083,00:31:49.625,He doesn't even speak English!
00:31:49.667,00:31:51.417,"Yeah, I'm sure of the math."
00:31:53.000,00:31:56.875,"Actually, my name's Jiang and I do speak English."
00:31:56.917,00:32:00.333,Jared likes to say I don't because he thinks it makes me seem more authentic.
00:32:00.375,00:32:03.458,And I got second in that national math competition.
00:32:03.500,00:32:08.417,So you're offering us a chance to short this pile of blocks? How?
00:32:08.458,00:32:10.667,With something called a credit default swap.
00:32:12.208,00:32:17.959,"It's like insurance on the bond, and if it goes bust you can make 10-to-1, even 20-to-1 return."
00:32:18.000,00:32:20.417,And it's already slowly going bust!
00:32:20.458,00:32:22.583,10-to-1? 20-to-1? No way.
00:32:22.625,00:32:25.000,JARED: And no one's paying attention.
00:32:25.041,00:32:27.500,No one is paying attention!
00:32:27.542,00:32:32.458,Because the banks are too busy getting paid obscene fees to sell these bonds.
00:32:32.500,00:32:35.291,But wait. You are the bank.
00:32:35.333,00:32:37.375,I bet your margins are pretty nice and fat.
00:32:37.417,00:32:39.792,"Let's not talk about my margins, by the way."
00:32:39.834,00:32:41.875,"Being nice and fat, that's a nice shirt."
00:32:42.750,00:32:44.000,VINNIE: Aren't you the bank?
00:32:44.041,00:32:47.250,I work for the bank.
00:32:47.291,00:32:51.166,"Big bank, small bank, I like to make money."
00:32:51.208,00:32:54.000,Let me put it this way.
00:32:54.041,00:32:56.834,And I'm offering you fire insurance on it.
00:32:56.875,00:32:59.500,How can these underlying bonds be as bad as you say?
00:32:59.542,00:33:00.792,It wouldn't be legal.
00:33:00.834,00:33:02.834,Nobody knows what's in them.
00:33:02.875,00:33:04.458,Nobody knows what's in the bonds.
00:33:04.500,00:33:13.875,I've seen some that are 65% AAA-rated that I know for a fact are filled with 95% subprime shit with FICOs below 550!
00:33:13.917,00:33:14.959,Get the fuck out of here.
00:33:15.000,00:33:16.208,You want me to really blow your mind?
00:33:16.250,00:33:20.500,"When the market deems a bond too risky to buy, what do you think we do with it?"
00:33:20.542,00:33:21.667,Take a guess.
00:33:21.709,00:33:23.208,I don't know. You tell me.
00:33:23.250,00:33:27.208,All right. You think we just warehouse it on the books? No.
00:33:27.250,00:33:32.083,We just repackage it with a bunch of other shit that didn't sell and put it into a CDO.
00:33:32.125,00:33:34.917,-MARK: A CDO?
00:33:34.959,00:33:36.750,-What is that?
00:33:34.959,00:33:40.834,"-This is where we take a bunch of B's, BB's and BBB's that haven't sold, and we put them in a pile."
00:33:42.250,00:33:54.208,"JARED: And when the pile gets large enough, the whole thing is suddenly considered diversified and the whores at the rating agency give it a 92%-93% AAA rating, no questions asked."
00:33:55.458,00:33:58.250,Hold it. What? Say that again.
00:33:58.291,00:34:00.625,A collateralized debt obligation.
00:34:00.667,00:34:06.417,It's important to understand because it's what allowed a housing crisis to become a nationwide economic disaster.
00:34:06.458,00:34:09.709,Here's world-famous chef Anthony Bourdain to explain.
00:34:14.208,00:34:17.834,"ANTHONY: Okay, I'm a chef on a Sunday afternoon setting the menu at a big restaurant."
00:34:17.875,00:34:22.291,"I ordered my fish on Friday, which is the mortgage bond that Michael Burry shorted."
00:34:22.333,00:34:24.333,But some of the fresh fish doesn't sell.
00:34:24.375,00:34:26.125,I don't know why.
00:34:24.375,00:34:27.792,Maybe it just came out halibut has the intelligence of a dolphin.
00:34:27.834,00:34:29.458,"So, what am I going to do?"
00:34:29.500,00:34:35.792,"Throw all this unsold fish, which is the BBB level of the bond, in the garbage and take the loss?"
00:34:36.291,00:34:37.667,No way.
00:34:37.709,00:34:45.041,"Being the crafty and morally onerous chef that I am, whatever crappy levels of the bond I don't sell, I throw into a seafood stew."
00:34:45.083,00:34:48.583,"See, it's not old fish."
00:34:48.625,00:34:52.291,And the best part is they're eating 3-day-old halibut.
00:34:52.333,00:34:54.041,That is a CDO.
00:34:54.083,00:34:57.083,"PORTER: I just need to know, how could these possibly be collated?"
00:34:57.125,00:35:01.709,Somehow you're like Dora the Explorer and you're the first person -who found this thing.
00:35:01.750,00:35:06.542,"So mortgage bonds are dog shit, CDOs are dog shit wrapped in cat shit."
00:35:08.041,00:35:09.792,"Yeah, that's right."
00:35:09.834,00:35:16.000,"Institutions treat these CDOs like they're as solid as treasury bonds, and they're going to zero."
00:35:16.041,00:35:18.291,DANNY: No.
00:35:16.041,00:35:20.875,There were $500 billion in housing bonds sold last year alone.
00:35:20.917,00:35:25.709,"The rating agencies, the banks, the fucking government, you're saying they're all asleep at the wheel?"
00:35:25.750,00:35:30.041,Yeah. My whole department's long on this stuff.
00:35:30.083,00:35:34.000,They call me Chicken Little.
00:35:36.583,00:35:40.291,"A's, zero. B's, zero."
00:35:40.333,00:35:43.667,"BB's, zero. BBB's, zero."
00:35:46.000,00:35:47.417,And then that happens.
00:35:47.458,00:35:49.208,What is that?
00:35:51.000,00:35:52.792,That's America's housing market.
00:35:55.667,00:35:56.750,Thank you.
00:35:56.792,00:35:57.834,"Fuckin' A, Jared."
00:35:57.875,00:35:59.959,Shut your fucking mouth.
00:36:00.000,00:36:01.000,...hang out with you.
00:36:01.041,00:36:02.291,MARK: Good. Okay.
00:36:02.333,00:36:04.417,"JARED: Sack up, do the deal."
00:36:04.458,00:36:05.583,MARK: We will see. Thank you.
00:36:05.625,00:36:06.750,JARED: Don't bullshit me.
00:36:06.792,00:36:08.000,"JARED: You're gonna say no, aren't you?"
00:36:08.041,00:36:10.583,"MIKE: No. No, I'm just evaluating right now."
00:36:10.625,00:36:13.375,Thank you.
00:36:13.417,00:36:14.834,"Bye, Jared."
00:36:20.750,00:36:22.291,VINNIE: I don't like it.
00:36:23.208,00:36:24.667,He's playing us.
00:36:26.041,00:36:27.875,He's playing us.
00:36:26.041,00:36:29.667,He's got too much skin in the game and he's dumping his position.
00:36:30.542,00:36:32.083,What if he's right?
00:36:32.125,00:36:33.667,You want him to be right.
00:36:33.709,00:36:35.250,"MARK: Yes, I do."
00:36:35.291,00:36:38.542,The banks have given us 25% interest rates on credit cards.
00:36:38.583,00:36:42.166,They have screwed us on student loans that we can never get out from under.
00:36:42.208,00:36:50.625,"Then this guy walks into my office and says those same banks got greedy, they lost track of the market, and I can profit off of their stupidity?"
00:36:50.667,00:36:52.959,"Fuck, yeah, I want him to be right!"
00:36:53.000,00:36:54.166,VINNIE: How come you don't hate this guy?
00:36:54.208,00:36:56.041,He's everything you taught us not to trust.
00:36:56.083,00:36:57.834,I can't hate him.
00:36:56.083,00:37:00.250,He is so transparent in his self-interest that I kind of respect him.
00:37:00.291,00:37:02.375,Would I buy a car from him? No.
00:37:03.542,00:37:04.959,Is he right about the mortgage market?
00:37:05.000,00:37:06.166,No.
00:37:06.208,00:37:07.333,Let's find out.
00:37:08.834,00:37:10.709,Look. It's two very simple questions.
00:37:10.750,00:37:12.291,Is there a housing bubble?
00:37:12.333,00:37:14.959,"And if there is, how exposed are the banks?"
00:37:15.000,00:37:15.834,PORTER: Yeah. Okay.
00:37:15.875,00:37:17.583,Let's get on this quickly too.
00:37:17.625,00:37:23.041,"Because if he's right, every loser with a couple million bucks and a fund is gonna be jumping on this."
00:37:23.083,00:37:24.166,Let's go.
00:37:26.333,00:37:27.917,WOMAN: Just that morning...
00:37:32.000,00:37:35.375,JPMorgan Chase.
00:37:37.166,00:37:39.458,JAMIE: Okay. Stop saying JPMorgan Chase.
00:37:39.500,00:37:40.959,I got a good feeling about this.
00:37:41.000,00:37:42.041,"It's just a meeting though, you know?"
00:37:43.250,00:37:44.417,It's just a meeting.
00:37:44.458,00:37:46.959,People have meetings all the time. You know?
00:37:47.000,00:37:48.667,"People drink their coffee, they have a meeting."
00:37:48.709,00:37:50.125,CHRIS: Brownfield Fund?
00:37:50.166,00:37:52.083,Hey. Hello.
00:37:52.125,00:37:53.542,Chris. I'm on Ted's desk.
00:37:53.583,00:37:54.959,Chris. Okay.
00:37:55.000,00:37:56.208,"I'm Charlie, Charlie Geller."
00:37:56.250,00:37:57.709,Jamie Shipley. Hi.
00:37:57.750,00:38:00.959,We're so excited to get set up on your trading platform.
00:38:01.000,00:38:02.166,Cool.
00:38:02.208,00:38:04.709,"Here, have a seat a second."
00:38:04.750,00:38:05.667,All right.
00:38:07.000,00:38:09.834,"So, I... Ted had asked me to do some meeting prep."
00:38:09.875,00:38:13.291,But I couldn't find any marketing material on you guys.
00:38:13.333,00:38:15.208,We just moved here from Boulder.
00:38:15.250,00:38:16.500,-Yeah.
00:38:16.542,00:38:19.208,Could we see some of your offering documents?
00:38:19.250,00:38:22.333,"Well, Brownfield is its own money."
00:38:22.375,00:38:24.083,-It's our money.
00:38:24.125,00:38:25.959,Can you tell us how much you manage?
00:38:26.000,00:38:29.500,Of course. We're doing $30 million right now.
00:38:29.542,00:38:32.083,"Um, but we started four years ago with $110,000."
00:38:32.125,00:38:33.625,CHRIS: Wow.
00:38:33.667,00:38:38.375,"So, as you can see, that's pretty phenomenal returns."
00:38:38.417,00:38:44.291,We want to get an ISDA agreement with JPMorgan so we can deal in long-term options.
00:38:44.333,00:38:45.750,-That's really cool.
00:38:58.583,00:39:00.000,That is so cool.
00:39:00.041,00:39:01.625,Thank you.
00:39:01.667,00:39:05.875,But you guys are under the capital requirements for an ISDA.
00:39:05.917,00:39:07.000,By how much?
00:39:07.542,00:39:08.750,Uh...
00:39:08.792,00:39:13.125,"One billion four hundred seventy million, so..."
00:39:13.166,00:39:14.792,...a lot.
00:39:15.959,00:39:20.792,"This makes us look bad, doesn't it, that we didn't know what the capital requirements were?"
00:39:20.834,00:39:21.834,Uh...
00:39:22.375,00:39:24.250,It's not great.
00:39:24.291,00:39:30.041,"But, uh, keep up those returns and give us a call way down the line. You know."
00:39:30.083,00:39:31.125,Okay?
00:39:31.166,00:39:32.542,-Okay.
00:39:32.583,00:39:33.625,"Have a good one, guys."
00:39:33.667,00:39:34.750,"JAMIE: Thank you, Chris."
00:39:38.959,00:39:40.041,Shit!
00:39:41.041,00:39:43.583,Who the fuck schedules a meeting at 4:50 in the afternoon?
00:39:43.625,00:39:44.625,"Oh, my, God."
00:39:44.667,00:39:46.458,That was so painful.
00:39:46.500,00:39:50.166,"Dude, B of A and Bear didn't even return our calls."
00:39:50.208,00:39:54.291,"And even fucking Wachovia -blew us off, man!"
00:39:54.333,00:39:58.375,Here's the prospectuses of all the other losers who didn't make it past the lobby.
00:39:58.417,00:40:00.333,JAMIE: I don't think I can do this anymore. You know.
00:40:00.375,00:40:03.333,"I'm young, yet."
00:40:03.375,00:40:06.333,I miss Colorado anyway.
00:40:06.375,00:40:08.458,"Gentlemen, I need you to leave."
00:40:08.500,00:40:09.959,"Yep, yep, we're going."
00:40:10.000,00:40:11.166,Look at this. Look at this.
00:40:11.208,00:40:15.625,This guy says that the housing market's a giant bubble.
00:40:17.917,00:40:20.125,"Okay, so this part isn't totally accurate, you know."
00:40:20.166,00:40:24.333,We didn't find Jared Vennett's housing bubble pitch in the lobby of a bank that rejected us.
00:40:24.375,00:40:30.291,"The truth is, um, a friend had told Charlie about it, and I read about it in Grant's Interest Rate Observer."
00:40:30.333,00:40:31.709,This is crazy.
00:40:31.750,00:40:34.333,This is crazy stuff.
00:40:34.375,00:40:40.792,"Shit, he's saying that there's 10-to-1 returns on credit default swaps for mortgage-backed securities?"
00:40:40.834,00:40:44.166,And the whole housing market is about to collapse?
00:40:44.208,00:40:48.542,"JARED: For Jamie and Charlie, the housing market doomsday prediction was music to their ears."
00:40:56.083,00:41:02.291,"They had started working out of Jamie's garage with $110,000 Jamie had saved taking sailboats up and down the East Coast."
00:41:04.125,00:41:05.917,Our investment strategy was simple.
00:41:05.959,00:41:10.542,"People hate to think about bad things happening, so they always underestimate their likelihood."
00:41:10.583,00:41:13.041,JARED: Their strategy was simple and brilliant.
00:41:13.083,00:41:14.875,What he said.
00:41:14.917,00:41:19.792,Jamie and Charlie found markets will sell options very cheaply on things they think will never happen.
00:41:19.834,00:41:23.500,"So when they were wrong, they were wrong small, but when they were right, they were right big."
00:41:30.333,00:41:34.125,"Within a few years they had turned $110,000 into $30 million."
00:41:34.166,00:41:35.917,But then it was time to go to New York City.
00:41:35.959,00:41:38.583,"And so far, it wasn't going very well."
00:41:38.625,00:41:40.417,So what if it does seem interesting. No...
00:41:40.458,00:41:44.041,No bank will give us our ISDA.
00:41:45.458,00:41:47.875,These kind of trades are totally out of the question.
00:41:47.917,00:41:49.667,We got to call Ben.
00:41:51.792,00:41:52.834,Let's call Ben!
00:41:54.375,00:41:59.125,JARED: Ben Rickert was a former trader in Singapore for Chase who quit the whole game in disgust.
00:41:59.166,00:42:03.792,He happened to be Jamie's neighbor when they were in Colorado and they met walking dogs.
00:42:03.834,00:42:05.250,But Ben was dark.
00:42:05.291,00:42:07.500,He didn't just think the whole system would fail.
00:42:07.542,00:42:09.834,He thought the whole world was going down.
00:42:11.792,00:42:14.709,Every one of these vegetables is fresh from my garden.
00:42:15.959,00:42:17.792,BEN: You guys should start your own garden.
00:42:17.834,00:42:21.291,What you got to do is get your soil off the petrochemicals.
00:42:21.333,00:42:23.583,I used wood ash and urine to help restore the soil.
00:42:23.625,00:42:25.250,It creates ammonium nitrate.
00:42:25.291,00:42:27.125,Seeds are gonna be the new currency.
00:42:27.166,00:42:29.166,And not those Franken-seeds from Monsanto.
00:42:29.208,00:42:31.625,"I'm talking about good, healthy, organic seeds."
00:42:31.667,00:42:33.083,Make yourself a garden.
00:42:33.125,00:42:34.458,Learn to live off the land.
00:42:34.500,00:42:37.667,JARED: Ben had real experience in a big bank.
00:42:37.709,00:42:40.709,Jamie and Charlie had never even been in a Manhattan bank bathroom.
00:42:40.750,00:42:42.458,But Ben was done with the banking world.
00:42:42.500,00:42:43.709,He was very clear.
00:42:43.750,00:42:47.917,"JAMIE: All right, let's crunch some numbers and then maybe we'll talk about calling Ben."
00:42:47.959,00:42:49.000,We're always crunching numbers.
00:42:49.041,00:42:50.250,When haven't we crunched the numbers?
00:42:50.291,00:42:51.125,We're gonna crunch the numbers like harder...
00:42:51.166,00:42:51.834,GUARD: I need you out of here.
00:42:51.875,00:42:53.834,Of course. One second.
00:42:53.875,00:42:54.709,"Yes, ma'am. We're going."
00:42:57.500,00:43:00.000,"PORTER: Oh, God. I hate this."
00:43:00.041,00:43:03.083,"Oh, come on. Would you relax?"
00:43:03.125,00:43:06.333,There's a housing development 45 minutes outside town.
00:43:06.375,00:43:08.083,Mark wants us to check that out first.
00:43:08.125,00:43:09.542,"Well, I hope there are some Cuban restaurants on the way there."
00:43:09.583,00:43:13.000,Because I heard the Cuban food is amazing in Miami.
00:43:13.041,00:43:15.792,Please don't be chipper in the face of me being miserable.
00:43:15.834,00:43:17.542,It really makes me hate you.
00:43:17.583,00:43:20.208,How is wanting to eat good food being chipper?
00:43:21.875,00:43:23.125,Hello?
00:43:24.458,00:43:25.667,Hello?
00:43:26.500,00:43:27.959,PORTER: What do these go for?
00:43:29.500,00:43:31.750,"DANNY: $425,000 each?"
00:43:53.041,00:43:54.667,"What's up, man?"
00:43:54.709,00:43:58.083,Hello. I'm surveying mortgage owners who are over 90 days delinquent.
00:43:58.125,00:44:00.709,I'm looking for a Harvey Humpsey.
00:44:00.750,00:44:02.000,You want my landlord's dog?
00:44:04.125,00:44:08.208,Your landlord filled out his mortgage application using his dog's name?
00:44:08.250,00:44:09.667,I guess so.
00:44:09.709,00:44:12.291,"Wait, has that asshole not been paying his mortgage?"
00:44:12.333,00:44:13.500,'Cause I've been paying my rent.
00:44:13.542,00:44:16.083,"Well, yeah, he is over 90 days delinquent."
00:44:16.125,00:44:19.583,"Seriously, man, am I gonna have to leave?"
00:44:22.083,00:44:24.500,"'Cause my kid just got settled in school, man."
00:44:24.542,00:44:26.792,Hey. How are ya?
00:44:27.417,00:44:28.583,My name's Ken.
00:44:28.625,00:44:29.959,You're Ken?
00:44:30.000,00:44:31.208,"Um, you should talk to your landlord about that."
00:44:31.250,00:44:33.417,"I'm sorry, I don't have any more information."
00:44:33.458,00:44:34.458,"But you, um..."
00:44:35.500,00:44:37.083,You have a great day.
00:44:37.125,00:44:38.583,KEN: There's books everywhere!
00:44:38.625,00:44:40.917,Books everywhere?
00:44:40.959,00:44:44.250,"Seriously, man, is everything gonna be okay?"
00:44:44.291,00:44:47.333,You should...
00:44:47.375,00:44:48.542,You should give him a call.
00:44:48.583,00:44:50.333,"It's not my fault, dude."
00:44:54.166,00:44:55.208,Hello!
00:44:59.166,00:45:01.333,Looks like the Mary Celeste.
00:45:01.375,00:45:04.875,Look. All they took was the TV.
00:45:04.917,00:45:06.917,DANNY: It's weird.
00:45:06.959,00:45:09.375,They didn't even clean out the cat litter.
00:45:17.834,00:45:18.959,"PORTER: Oh, God."
00:45:30.500,00:45:32.375,It's like Chernobyl.
00:45:32.417,00:45:36.041,There's like a hundred houses.
00:45:38.000,00:45:39.125,"Oh, fuck that!"
00:45:39.166,00:45:40.250,Shit!
00:45:55.083,00:45:56.291,MAN: He's been in there for seven hours.
00:45:56.333,00:45:58.291,Where does he go to the bathroom?
00:45:58.333,00:45:59.625,I heard he had a breakdown.
00:45:59.667,00:46:01.667,He's letting the fund tank.
00:46:01.709,00:46:03.250,My buddy in Manhattan said...
00:46:03.291,00:46:05.125,Dr. Burry's office.
00:46:05.166,00:46:06.834,"No, he actually prefers that you email him."
00:46:06.875,00:46:08.458,Excuse me.
00:46:08.500,00:46:09.583,"Mr. Fields, Mr..."
00:46:13.625,00:46:15.458,"Hi, Lawrence."
00:46:17.041,00:46:24.542,We have no confidence in your ability to identify macroeconomic trends.
00:46:24.583,00:46:27.166,MIKE: You flew here to tell me that? Why?
00:46:27.208,00:46:30.667,Anyone can see that there is a real estate bubble.
00:46:30.709,00:46:32.583,"Actually, no one can see a bubble."
00:46:32.625,00:46:33.875,That's what makes it a bubble.
00:46:33.917,00:46:36.250,"That's dumb, Lawrence."
00:46:36.291,00:46:37.917,There's always markers.
00:46:38.625,00:46:47.125,"Mortgage fraud has quintupled since 2000 and the average take-home pay is flat, but home prices are soaring."
00:46:47.166,00:46:49.625,"That means the homes are debt, not assets."
00:46:49.667,00:46:59.375,"So Mike Burry of San Jose, a guy who gets his hair cut at Supercuts and doesn't wear shoes, knows more than Alan Greenspan and Hank Paulson."
00:46:59.417,00:47:00.333,Well...
00:47:01.417,00:47:06.792,"Dr. Mike Burry, That's cute. That's cute."
00:47:06.834,00:47:09.250,"Are you being sarcastic with us, Mike?"
00:47:12.291,00:47:16.917,"Lawrence, I don't know how to be sarcastic."
00:47:16.959,00:47:20.333,I don't know how to be funny.
00:47:16.959,00:47:21.917,I don't know how to work people.
00:47:21.959,00:47:23.166,I...
00:47:23.208,00:47:25.583,I just know how to read numbers.
00:47:25.625,00:47:28.458,How big is your short position right now?
00:47:28.500,00:47:29.583,Um...
00:47:29.625,00:47:31.750,Just $1.3 billion.
00:47:31.792,00:47:33.250,And the premiums?
00:47:33.291,00:47:42.208,"Well, we pay, uh, roughly $80 to 90 million each year, which is high, but I was the first to do this trade."
00:47:42.250,00:47:45.792,"Watch. It will pay. I may have been early, but I'm not wrong."
00:47:45.834,00:47:48.959,It's the same thing.
00:47:49.000,00:47:53.625,"You're managing a fund of, what, $555 million?"
00:47:53.667,00:47:57.625,"In six years, it'll all be gone."
00:47:57.667,00:47:59.417,On one bet.
00:47:59.458,00:48:02.667,"No, the second quarter of '07 is when the adjustable rates kick in."
00:48:02.709,00:48:04.250,The defaults will skyrocket.
00:48:04.291,00:48:05.834,Yeah. Says you.
00:48:05.875,00:48:08.625,LAWRENCE: How much is eligible for withdrawal before they do?
00:48:08.667,00:48:11.291,"Say, in the next two quarters."
00:48:11.333,00:48:13.417,If your investors panic.
00:48:16.834,00:48:17.917,$302 million?
00:48:17.959,00:48:19.041,I...
00:48:19.834,00:48:21.542,"My God, Mike."
00:48:26.291,00:48:28.333,No one will pull out.
00:48:28.375,00:48:30.834,"I mean, I'm down 17% for the year."
00:48:30.875,00:48:33.208,"But if they trust me, and they trust me, because..."
00:48:33.250,00:48:35.917,No one trusts you! No one!
00:48:35.959,00:48:40.959,I sent several emails to my investors letting them know that the...
00:48:42.166,00:48:47.208,...the second quarter of '07 is when our housing positions show returns and...
00:48:48.500,00:48:49.542,I've been very clear.
00:48:50.583,00:48:53.959,People will withdraw their money.
00:48:54.000,00:48:57.500,"Lawrence, that would be so stupid. I mean, the..."
00:48:57.542,00:49:04.625,"capitals drop too much, then the swaps contracts are voided."
00:49:04.667,00:49:08.000,And then the banks get to keep all of the collateral.
00:49:08.041,00:49:09.166,MARTIN: Wait a minute. Wait.
00:49:09.208,00:49:10.291,All of it.
00:49:10.333,00:49:12.542,The contracts are voided?
00:49:12.583,00:49:15.041,The contracts are voided?
00:49:15.083,00:49:16.667,Holy shit!
00:49:17.208,00:49:18.291,"Oh, motherfucker!"
00:49:18.875,00:49:20.709,Michael?
00:49:20.750,00:49:22.500,Give me my money back.
00:49:25.834,00:49:29.333,"Michael, do you hear me?"
00:49:31.709,00:49:34.125,Give me my fucking money back...
00:49:37.458,00:49:40.667,The market's in an itsy-bitsy little gully right now.
00:49:40.709,00:49:43.041,"It's like everybody said, Okay, that was crazy."
00:49:43.083,00:49:45.000,Let's just all calm down.
00:49:46.792,00:49:50.583,"I sold that house for $350,000 the year it was built."
00:49:50.625,00:49:52.875,"Two years later, $480,000."
00:49:52.917,00:49:56.208,"Then $585,000 maybe 18 months ago."
00:49:56.250,00:49:59.250,"This couple bought it for $650,000 last year."
00:49:59.291,00:50:01.166,He'd let it go for that.
00:50:01.208,00:50:02.959,"Hi, John."
00:50:04.625,00:50:06.083,"It will break his heart, but he'll let it go."
00:50:06.125,00:50:07.875,Why is he selling?
00:50:07.917,00:50:10.709,MARLENE: Neither one's working right now.
00:50:10.750,00:50:13.417,"Marlene, you'd say they're motivated, right?"
00:50:13.458,00:50:16.500,As motivated as one can be in this neighborhood.
00:50:16.542,00:50:19.166,"This house on the left, I would say they're probably motivated."
00:50:19.208,00:50:21.208,"Wow, a lot of people seem very motivated."
00:50:21.250,00:50:22.583,"MARLENE: Oh, it's just the gully."
00:50:22.625,00:50:24.417,That's all. Just...
00:50:24.458,00:50:25.917,Just nerves.
00:50:25.959,00:50:27.750,So where do we stand?
00:50:28.834,00:50:31.375,I need to talk to my wife.
00:50:31.417,00:50:32.750,MAN: This market won't last.
00:50:32.792,00:50:34.625,"MARK: Actually, could I talk to a mortgage broker?"
00:50:34.667,00:50:36.542,Anybody you recommend?
00:50:36.583,00:50:38.625,"MARLENE: Yes, yes, I have someone. Absolutely."
00:50:38.667,00:50:40.000,"Yeah, bitch better like me."
00:50:40.041,00:50:41.458,Sent her ass to Cabo.
00:50:42.792,00:50:45.750,So is Morgan Stanley recruiting us? Is that it?
00:50:45.792,00:50:49.959,"Oh, no. No. The bank owns our hedge fund, but we're not really part of it."
00:50:50.000,00:50:55.500,We invest in financial service companies and we're trying to understand the residential mortgage business.
00:50:55.542,00:50:58.542,How many loans do you write each month?
00:50:58.583,00:51:00.166,Yeah.
00:51:00.208,00:51:01.750,What was it four years ago?
00:51:02.709,00:51:04.041,Ten...
00:51:04.083,00:51:05.208,Maybe 15.
00:51:05.250,00:51:07.500,"Yeah, I was a bartender."
00:51:07.542,00:51:08.834,You own a...
00:51:08.875,00:51:12.125,So how many of these are adjustable-rate mortgages?
00:51:12.166,00:51:13.875,"MAN IN BLACK: Well, most."
00:51:13.917,00:51:15.917,"Yeah, I'd say about 90%."
00:51:15.959,00:51:19.125,The bonuses on those skyrocketed a few years ago.
00:51:19.166,00:51:20.500,Adjustable's our bread and honey.
00:51:20.542,00:51:23.166,So do applicants ever get rejected?
00:51:27.458,00:51:28.375,Seriously?
00:51:29.667,00:51:31.625,"Look, if they get rejected, I suck at my job."
00:51:31.667,00:51:33.208,DANNY: Even if they have no money?
00:51:33.250,00:51:36.166,"Well, my firm offers NINJA loans."
00:51:36.208,00:51:37.500,PORTER: Okay.
00:51:37.542,00:51:38.834,"No Income, No Job."
00:51:38.875,00:51:41.083,I just leave the income section blank if I want.
00:51:41.125,00:51:42.583,Corporate doesn't care.
00:51:42.625,00:51:46.041,These people just want homes.
00:51:46.083,00:51:46.875,PORTER: Good for you.
00:51:46.917,00:51:48.250,Your companies don't verify?
00:51:51.917,00:51:57.250,"If I write a loan on Friday afternoon, a big bank will buy it by Monday lunch."
00:51:57.291,00:51:58.709,Yeah. Same here.
00:52:00.417,00:52:01.875,Could you hold on a second?
00:52:01.917,00:52:03.375,Yeah.
00:52:09.000,00:52:11.709,I don't get it.
00:52:11.750,00:52:13.750,They're not confessing.
00:52:13.792,00:52:15.542,They're bragging.
00:52:24.125,00:52:29.125,Do people have any idea what they are buying?
00:52:29.166,00:52:31.500,"the immigrants, you know."
00:52:31.542,00:52:34.333,"Once they find out they're getting a home, they sign where you tell them to sign."
00:52:34.375,00:52:36.917,Don't ask questions.
00:52:36.959,00:52:38.417,Fucking idiots.
00:52:38.458,00:52:39.875,"And you target immigrants, too?"
00:52:39.917,00:52:42.875,"Well, their credit actually isn't bad enough for him."
00:52:44.709,00:52:46.834,"Look, I'm a yield guy."
00:52:46.875,00:52:47.792,Okay...
00:52:49.166,00:52:52.500,"I make $2,000 on a fixed-rate prime loan, right?"
00:52:52.542,00:52:56.166,"But I can make $10,000 on a subprime adjustable."
00:52:56.208,00:52:59.250,"Trust me, I'm not driving a 7 Series without strippers."
00:52:59.291,00:53:02.583,No one on the pole has good credit and they're all cash rich.
00:53:02.625,00:53:05.417,I think I read Warren Buffett say something like that.
00:53:05.458,00:53:08.208,What? Who's Warren Buffett?
00:53:08.250,00:53:11.041,"Okay, so strippers."
00:53:11.083,00:53:12.291,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:53:12.333,00:53:14.375,"Nude, you know, topless."
00:53:14.417,00:53:16.333,-Strippers.
00:53:19.834,00:53:21.083,Can you introduce us?
00:53:21.125,00:53:23.625,Yes! Yes.
00:53:26.250,00:53:28.583,I always get option-pay adjustables.
00:53:28.625,00:53:30.333,MARK: What? I can't hear you. I'm sorry.
00:53:30.375,00:53:32.250,I always get option-pay adjustables.
00:53:32.291,00:53:34.583,I'm a private contractor.
00:53:34.625,00:53:37.250,And you tell the mortgage company what you do?
00:53:37.291,00:53:39.333,I write therapist.
00:53:39.375,00:53:41.250,-You can touch me.
00:53:41.291,00:53:42.542,Only in V.I.P.
00:53:42.583,00:53:45.250,"No, no, no, you say you always do adjustables."
00:53:45.291,00:53:47.125,And you have more than one loan on a property?
00:53:47.166,00:53:49.417,Everybody does.
00:53:49.458,00:53:50.458,"MARK: I'm sorry, what?"
00:53:50.500,00:53:53.166,Everybody does.
00:53:53.208,00:53:55.417,"That way you only put down, like, 5%."
00:53:55.458,00:53:57.333,"Prices have leveled off, though, right?"
00:53:57.375,00:53:58.875,Yeah. There's a gully.
00:53:58.917,00:54:03.083,Would you mind not moving anymore?
00:54:06.792,00:54:09.542,Sorry. We're not alone.
00:54:09.583,00:54:12.250,"Okay, look."
00:54:09.583,00:54:14.625,"If home prices don't go up, you are not going to be able to refinance."
00:54:14.667,00:54:20.959,And you'll be stuck paying whatever your monthly payment is once it jumps up after your teaser rate expires.
00:54:21.000,00:54:23.417,Your monthlies could go up 200%-300%.
00:54:23.458,00:54:25.542,James says I can always refinance.
00:54:25.583,00:54:27.083,"Well, he's a liar."
00:54:27.125,00:54:30.667,"Actually, in this particular case, James probably is wrong."
00:54:30.709,00:54:34.041,200 percent? On all my loans?
00:54:34.083,00:54:35.458,What do you mean all your loans?
00:54:35.500,00:54:38.750,"We're talking about two loans on one house, right?"
00:54:38.792,00:54:40.834,I have five houses.
00:54:40.875,00:54:42.917,And a condo.
00:54:44.750,00:54:45.542,"Hey, there's a bubble."
00:54:45.583,00:54:47.166,VINNIE: How do you know?
00:54:47.208,00:54:50.875,"Trust me. Call Vennett, buy $50 million in swaps on the MBS."
00:54:50.917,00:54:53.917,What do we got?
00:54:53.959,00:54:55.458,"Mark, are you sure?"
00:54:55.500,00:54:57.417,"Yeah. Yeah, it's time to call bullshit."
00:54:57.458,00:54:58.792,Bullshit on what?
00:54:58.834,00:55:00.166,Every fucking thing.
00:55:24.250,00:55:26.000,FrontPoint! FrontPoint!
00:55:27.792,00:55:29.583,Is this America's angriest hedge fund?
00:55:29.625,00:55:32.959,"VINNIE: All right, listen."
00:55:33.000,00:55:34.917,How are you fucking us?
00:55:36.667,00:55:38.083,"There's a nicer way to say that, Vinnie."
00:55:38.125,00:55:39.834,I'm serious.
00:55:39.875,00:55:42.959,"We'll buy your swaps, but only if you say how you're fucking us."
00:55:43.000,00:55:45.583,"I'm not fucking you, Vinnie."
00:55:45.625,00:55:48.458,"I'm looking deep into your eyes as I make love to you, Vinnie."
00:55:48.500,00:55:51.834,I'm handing you the deal of the century on a fucking platter.
00:55:51.875,00:55:54.291,What do I get out of it? Easy.
00:55:54.333,00:55:56.792,I got a $20-million-a-month negative carry.
00:55:56.834,00:56:00.792,I got bosses trying to pull the plug because they think I'm out of my fucking mind.
00:56:00.834,00:56:01.834,All right?
00:56:01.875,00:56:05.458,"We make this trade, those problems aren't so big anymore."
00:56:05.500,00:56:09.333,"And sure, swaps are a dark market, so I set the price."
00:56:09.375,00:56:10.875,Whatever price I want.
00:56:10.917,00:56:15.750,"And when you come for the payday, I'm gonna rip your eyes out, I'm gonna make a fortune."
00:56:15.792,00:56:19.625,"But the good news is, Vinnie, you're not gonna care because you're gonna make so much fucking money."
00:56:19.667,00:56:20.792,That's what I get out of it.
00:56:20.834,00:56:22.500,Want to know what you get out of it?
00:56:22.542,00:56:25.917,"You get the ice cream, the hot fudge, the banana, and the nuts."
00:56:25.959,00:56:30.458,"Right now, I get the sprinkles, and, yeah, if this goes through, I get the cherry."
00:56:30.500,00:56:32.834,"But you get the sundae, Vinnie."
00:56:32.875,00:56:34.625,You get the sundae.
00:56:36.959,00:56:39.792,"All right, I buy that."
00:56:39.834,00:56:42.041,So what do you say?
00:56:42.083,00:56:44.000,-You want me to make you a market?
00:56:44.041,00:56:47.625,"We'll take $50 million, Garibaldi IV, BBB."
00:56:49.000,00:56:51.125,Sharpen your pencils.
00:56:53.834,00:56:55.417,"Fuck you, too."
00:56:57.291,00:56:58.875,Yes!
00:57:00.917,00:57:02.083,That's right.
00:57:03.875,00:57:05.792,"Oh, man."
00:57:05.834,00:57:11.834,"He has so many numbers, and I always forget which one he prefers, because he's very specific."
00:57:11.875,00:57:12.875,Start with the first one.
00:57:12.917,00:57:14.458,I don't know if it's the first one.
00:57:14.500,00:57:15.875,Just try it.
00:57:15.917,00:57:17.542,Okay. I... Okay.
00:57:35.083,00:57:36.500,Ben Rickert.
00:57:36.542,00:57:37.917,"Hey, Ben. It's Jamie."
00:57:39.333,00:57:41.667,"Jamie, you know you're not supposed to use this line."
00:57:43.750,00:57:45.083,Told you.
00:57:46.375,00:57:49.083,"Okay, let's try number two out of 14."
00:58:00.542,00:58:01.583,Ben Rickert.
00:58:01.625,00:58:03.333,"Ben, why do you do that, man? I mean..."
00:58:03.375,00:58:06.250,"You're a retired trader, okay?"
00:58:06.291,00:58:09.500,The NSA has a $52 billion budget and the ability to monitor tens of millions of calls a second.
00:58:09.542,00:58:11.917,You think they're not using it?
00:58:11.959,00:58:17.583,"Hey, I promise I will refrain from saying Ben Rickert and dirty bomb in the same sent..."
00:58:18.709,00:58:20.625,Jesus fucking Christ.
00:58:22.041,00:58:23.458,Ben Rickert.
00:58:23.500,00:58:25.875,"Did you get a chance to look at what we sent you, Ben?"
00:58:25.917,00:58:28.750,"It's Charlie. I'm here, too."
00:58:28.792,00:58:31.208,"Hi, Charlie."
00:58:37.125,00:58:38.291,"Ben, you still there?"
00:58:38.333,00:58:39.458,Yeah.
00:58:40.208,00:58:42.291,"I'll be honest, gentlemen."
00:58:42.333,00:58:44.375,It scared the shit out of me.
00:58:44.417,00:58:45.834,"But that's a good thing, right?"
00:58:45.875,00:58:49.333,That means this Vennett guy's not wrong.
00:58:49.375,00:58:50.542,"No, he's not."
00:58:53.166,00:58:54.000,Cool.
00:58:54.041,00:58:55.959,Tell me more about these CDOs.
00:58:56.000,00:58:59.750,"JAMIE: Yeah, yeah."
00:58:56.000,00:59:03.125,"Okay, so, you know, Vennett mentions the CDOs, but actually, we took a look and they're way worse than even he realizes."
00:59:03.166,00:59:04.625,These things don't make any sense!
00:59:04.667,00:59:05.792,JAMIE: We can't even model them.
00:59:05.834,00:59:08.792,These are 100 times bigger than the MBS.
00:59:08.834,00:59:10.417,And 90% AAA-rated.
00:59:10.458,00:59:12.000,Yes! Exactly!
00:59:12.041,00:59:13.417,It's incredible.
00:59:13.458,00:59:17.375,I took a good hard look at the CDOs you want to short.
00:59:17.417,00:59:20.458,They're brilliant.
00:59:20.500,00:59:22.709,Jamie. Very good.
00:59:22.750,00:59:26.291,What can I say?
00:59:26.333,00:59:31.333,"CHARLIE: So, Ben, we shorted the BB's and the BBB's, and the risk is relatively low."
00:59:31.375,00:59:32.709,"Payoff is, like, 25-to-1."
00:59:32.750,00:59:34.125,Yeah.
00:59:36.375,00:59:38.542,"Okay, so, why are you calling me?"
00:59:38.583,00:59:39.834,"Look, Ben?"
00:59:40.917,00:59:44.875,We need you to help us get the ISDA.
00:59:44.917,00:59:48.041,"If we get a hunting license, we can short this crap."
00:59:48.083,00:59:49.208,And we know you hate Wall Street.
00:59:49.250,00:59:50.542,We're not asking you to do the trading.
00:59:50.583,00:59:57.875,We're simply asking you to help us get a seat at the fucking table.
00:59:57.917,00:59:59.583,"It's a pretty ugly table, guys."
00:59:59.625,01:00:04.959,"Look, Ben, the system fucked up in a big, big way here, okay?"
01:00:05.000,01:00:10.375,"And somehow, uh, we know before anyone else."
01:00:10.417,01:00:13.417,You know? This is a once-in-a-lifetime deal.
01:00:15.959,01:00:17.041,I'm thinking.
01:00:22.041,01:00:24.000,Okay. I'll call Deutsche Bank.
01:00:24.041,01:00:26.333,"Thank you, Ben. Thank you."
01:00:26.375,01:00:30.250,And Bear. What about Bear?
01:00:30.291,01:00:32.667,Okay. Bear will trade with anybody.
01:01:20.750,01:01:23.542,All right. I'll see if I can push it through.
01:01:23.583,01:01:25.500,"Thank you, Noah."
01:01:27.375,01:01:28.667,Couldn't we go inside?
01:01:28.709,01:01:30.000,"Yeah, me, too."
01:02:14.041,01:02:16.417,Hi. It's Mark. I need to talk to Vinnie right now.
01:02:16.458,01:02:23.917,"We're just asking you to explain to us just how it is that you are fucking us, because what we are seeing..."
01:02:26.750,01:02:27.875,"Morgan Stanley building, fast."
01:02:29.083,01:02:31.542,Are we hooked up to the same computer screen?
01:02:31.583,01:02:33.417,It doesn't make any sense.
01:02:36.083,01:02:37.917,"MARK: Vinnie, you there?"
01:02:37.959,01:02:38.583,"Mark, you there?"
01:02:38.625,01:02:39.834,"Yeah, did you hear?"
01:02:39.875,01:02:41.000,Mortgage defaults have gone through the roof.
01:02:41.041,01:02:43.750,Is anybody jumping off of buildings yet?
01:02:43.792,01:02:45.375,Why would they?
01:02:45.417,01:02:46.834,What?
01:02:46.875,01:02:50.208,Vennett wants $1.9 million more in collateral by close.
01:02:50.250,01:02:51.417,Vennett's asking us to post collateral.
01:02:51.458,01:02:53.041,What the hell is going on?
01:02:53.083,01:02:55.125,"We don't know, but Deutsche's on the phone demanding payment."
01:02:55.166,01:02:57.041,Call Vennett.
01:02:57.083,01:02:59.083,Call Vennett.
01:02:59.125,01:03:04.125,"So subprime loans go bad, but subprime bonds, which are made up of subprime loans, are more valuable?"
01:03:04.166,01:03:06.834,I know. They want another $1.9 million by market close.
01:03:06.875,01:03:09.083,What about the ratings agencies?
01:03:09.125,01:03:11.583,Are they downgrading the CDOs and mortgage bonds?
01:03:11.625,01:03:12.750,Where are the ratings agencies at?
01:03:12.792,01:03:14.375,They're the fucking same.
01:03:14.417,01:03:15.583,"No, they're all still AAA."
01:03:15.625,01:03:18.500,What the hell?
01:03:18.542,01:03:20.625,Those fuckers!
01:03:20.667,01:03:23.667,"They go public, and all they care about is their bottom line and their shit."
01:03:23.709,01:03:25.500,"Hey, Mark, that's not all."
01:03:25.542,01:03:26.834,The Morgan Stanley risk guys are here.
01:03:26.875,01:03:28.333,They called in Kathy Tao.
01:03:28.375,01:03:30.583,They're trying to convince her to make us sell our swaps.
01:03:30.625,01:03:35.750,"Apparently, tying up six years of insurance payments in hopes of a housing Armageddon is not prudent investing."
01:03:35.792,01:03:37.500,What did Kathy say?
01:03:37.542,01:03:40.250,Nothing yet.
01:03:40.291,01:03:46.792,"Okay, I want you to walk back in there and very calmly, very politely, tell the risk assessors to fuck off."
01:03:46.834,01:03:48.542,And then meet me over at Standard &amp; Poor's.
01:03:48.583,01:03:50.000,We're gonna talk to Georgia.
01:03:50.041,01:03:51.208,VINNIE: All right. Okay.
01:03:51.250,01:03:53.291,Get that fuck Jared Vennett in this office.
01:03:53.333,01:03:55.208,I'm gonna bash his fucking head in.
01:04:00.125,01:04:01.750,"Uh, gentlemen?"
01:04:01.792,01:04:04.875,I spoke with Mark Baum.
01:04:18.625,01:04:21.041,I can't see a damn thing.
01:04:22.333,01:04:24.875,always busy.
01:04:24.917,01:04:30.250,"I end up taking any appointment they'll give me, and then the whole morning gets shot to hell!"
01:04:30.291,01:04:31.834,So...
01:04:32.291,01:04:39.583,"All righty, FrontPoint Partners, how can Standard &amp; Poor's help you?"
01:04:39.625,01:04:46.834,"VINNIE: Well, we don't understand why the ratings agencies haven't downgraded subprime bonds since the underlying loans are clearly deteriorating."
01:04:46.875,01:04:51.208,"Well, the delinquency rates do have people worried, but they're actually within our models."
01:04:51.250,01:04:53.208,So...
01:04:54.375,01:04:59.417,...you're convinced the underlying mortgages in these bonds are solid loans.
01:04:59.458,01:05:01.375,"GEORGIA: That is our opinion, yes."
01:05:01.417,01:05:03.542,Have you looked at the loan-level data?
01:05:03.583,01:05:06.750,"I mean, they're giving these loans to anybody with a credit score and a pulse."
01:05:06.792,01:05:09.375,"Excuse me, sir. What do you think we do here all day?"
01:05:09.417,01:05:10.417,VINNIE: We're not sure.
01:05:10.458,01:05:11.417,Here's what I don't understand...
01:05:11.458,01:05:12.667,"We check, recheck, recheck again."
01:05:12.709,01:05:15.000,MARK: If these mortgage bonds are so stable...
01:05:15.041,01:05:16.709,Perhaps you could check your friend.
01:05:16.750,01:05:18.792,MARK: ...have you ever refused to rate...
01:05:18.834,01:05:20.208,"VINNIE: Ma'am, that's delusional."
01:05:20.250,01:05:21.458,GEORGIA: We stand behind them.
01:05:21.500,01:05:26.458,"MARK: Georgia, have you ever refused to rate any of these bonds upper tranches AAA?"
01:05:26.500,01:05:28.125,Can we see the paperwork on those deals?
01:05:28.166,01:05:31.250,"I am under no obligation to share that information with you, whoever you might be."
01:05:31.291,01:05:33.208,"Just answer the question, Georgia."
01:05:33.250,01:05:41.000,Can you name one time in the past year where you checked the tape and you didn't give the banks the AAA percentage they wanted?
01:05:43.208,01:05:47.250,"If we don't give them the ratings, they'll go to Moody's, right down the block."
01:05:47.291,01:05:51.250,"If we don't work with them, they will go to our competitors."
01:05:51.291,01:05:54.542,Not our fault.
01:05:58.792,01:06:00.041,VINNIE: Holy shit.
01:06:00.083,01:06:01.375,"Yes, now you see."
01:06:02.333,01:06:04.458,And I never said that.
01:06:04.500,01:06:06.834,They're selling ratings for fees.
01:06:06.875,01:06:08.000,A ratings shop.
01:06:08.041,01:06:10.875,You can afford to make less. Make less.
01:06:10.917,01:06:12.834,Nobody said that.
01:06:12.875,01:06:15.083,And it is not my decision.
01:06:15.125,01:06:16.583,Are you kidding me?
01:06:16.625,01:06:17.959,"No, I am not kidding you."
01:06:18.000,01:06:20.083,How'd your boss do on the IPO?
01:06:20.125,01:06:21.625,MARK: Is that the angle you're taking?
01:06:21.667,01:06:26.792,"So, now, anyone who has a boss can't be held responsible for doing shitty and illegal things."
01:06:26.834,01:06:28.458,"What are you, four?"
01:06:28.500,01:06:32.834,"No, I am not four, Mr. Baum. I am not, no."
01:06:32.875,01:06:36.333,And I wonder what your incentives might be.
01:06:36.375,01:06:41.083,Is it maybe in your best interest to have the ratings change?
01:06:42.792,01:06:45.417,How many credit default swaps do you own? Hmm?
01:06:47.417,01:06:49.291,It doesn't make me wrong.
01:06:49.333,01:06:50.500,No.
01:06:50.542,01:06:52.750,It just makes you a hypocrite.
01:07:33.291,01:07:35.250,Fuck!
01:07:35.291,01:07:38.667,BEN: Mortgage delinquencies went up and the CDOs got more valuable. Unbelievable.
01:07:38.709,01:07:39.667,Unbelievable.
01:07:39.709,01:07:40.834,We know.
01:07:40.875,01:07:41.959,I just called an old friend at Bear.
01:07:42.000,01:07:45.000,He didn't even know what a CDO is.
01:07:45.041,01:07:48.834,"JAMIE: Yeah, I just had to wire Bear and Deutsche $70,000."
01:07:48.875,01:07:52.917,It's like two plus two equals fish.
01:07:52.959,01:07:55.709,CHARLIE: It's rigged.
01:07:55.750,01:07:57.583,We're gonna lose everything.
01:07:57.625,01:08:00.583,I'm gonna have to move back in with my mom.
01:08:00.625,01:08:02.083,Can't do that.
01:08:02.125,01:08:04.291,"BEN: All right. Well, I got a colonic appointment."
01:08:04.333,01:08:06.041,"Wait a minute. Hold on, Ben."
01:08:06.083,01:08:07.458,"Ben, look."
01:08:07.500,01:08:19.166,"Either the banks are clueless and they don't know how to value these CDOs, or they're such crooks that the CDOs are worth shit and they're hiding it."
01:08:21.417,01:08:23.208,I think we should buy more swaps.
01:08:23.250,01:08:24.458,What?
01:08:24.500,01:08:26.583,"Suck it up and pay up, fellas. We made a deal."
01:08:26.625,01:08:28.709,No way! No!
01:08:28.750,01:08:30.208,Are you fucking kidding me?
01:08:30.250,01:08:32.625,Are you serious?
01:08:32.667,01:08:34.041,No. No. No. No. No.
01:08:34.083,01:08:35.333,Yeah. Yeah.
01:08:41.917,01:08:43.208,No! No! No!
01:08:43.250,01:08:44.750,"BEN: No, seriously, a colonic once a year."
01:08:44.792,01:08:46.500,DANNY: Ass!
01:08:46.542,01:08:48.917,"PORTER: And you got a matching little butler boy, you buttfuck!"
01:08:53.208,01:08:55.041,Are you done?
01:08:55.083,01:08:58.750,God! I pulled a muscle in my back from yelling.
01:08:58.792,01:08:59.709,Ow!
01:09:01.166,01:09:04.083,VINNIE: Mortgage defaults have done nothing but go up.
01:09:04.125,01:09:08.125,Yet you quote us a higher price on the bonds.
01:09:08.166,01:09:10.333,Please explain that to me.
01:09:10.375,01:09:14.000,There's no way you're marking these swaps appropriately.
01:09:14.041,01:09:16.041,Why shouldn't we back out of this trade right now?
01:09:18.458,01:09:24.542,"JARED: Didn't I say when we made this deal that the ratings agencies, the SEC and the big banks were clueless?"
01:09:24.583,01:09:25.917,CHRIS: Yes.
01:09:25.959,01:09:27.875,"Yes, you did. You did."
01:09:27.917,01:09:29.417,Shut up.
01:09:29.458,01:09:32.458,"Now their foot's on fire, they think their steak is done, and you're surprised?"
01:09:32.500,01:09:35.333,That's not stupidity.
01:09:35.375,01:09:39.166,"Tell me the difference between stupid and illegal, and I'll have my wife's brother arrested."
01:09:40.250,01:09:42.125,That was funny.
01:09:42.166,01:09:45.875,JARED: I guess you just don't realize how clueless the system really is.
01:09:45.917,01:09:51.750,"Yes, there's some shady shit going down, but trust me, it's fueled by stupidity!"
01:09:52.875,01:09:53.792,Look at yourselves.
01:09:55.250,01:10:01.000,"You know, you pass yourself off as cynical people but you still have some faith in the system, don't you?"
01:10:01.041,01:10:02.250,I don't.
01:10:02.291,01:10:05.375,"Well, except for Vinnie."
01:10:05.417,01:10:06.917,JAMIE: No way!
01:10:06.959,01:10:10.458,"Either we're right or we're wrong in a giant, giant way."
01:10:10.500,01:10:14.125,"And if we're wrong, then we got to find someone to help us get out of this trade."
01:10:14.166,01:10:16.959,I'm not feeling remotely confident that we're right.
01:10:17.000,01:10:20.417,"And if we're wrong, who's gonna tell us?"
01:10:20.458,01:10:24.250,Who understands this stuff?
01:10:26.500,01:10:28.208,BEN: I think we need to go to Vegas.
01:10:28.250,01:10:29.375,What's in Vegas?
01:10:29.417,01:10:30.250,Vegas?
01:10:30.291,01:10:32.083,What the hell's in Las Vegas?
01:10:33.542,01:10:36.709,The American Securitization Forum is there next week.
01:10:36.750,01:10:41.375,"Every bond and CDO salesman, subprime lender and swap trader is gonna be there."
01:10:41.417,01:10:44.208,"I'm telling you, your bet is against dumb money."
01:10:44.250,01:10:47.041,It's about time you find out just how dumb that money really is.
01:10:47.083,01:10:48.375,"PORTER: God, I hate Vegas."
01:10:48.417,01:10:49.917,I hear the food has gotten really good in Vegas.
01:10:49.959,01:10:51.500,They have a Nobu now.
01:10:51.542,01:10:53.208,Would you fucking stop it?
01:11:39.500,01:11:40.542,CHARLIE: Any sense?
01:11:40.583,01:11:42.417,BEN: And if a bond is rich it is...
01:11:42.458,01:11:44.041,"I don't know, loaded with assets?"
01:11:44.083,01:11:45.291,Rich just means overpriced.
01:11:45.333,01:11:47.625,"I can't sleep on planes, so I did my homework."
01:11:47.667,01:11:50.125,"Okay, let's focus."
01:11:50.166,01:11:56.041,To figure out if this is a deal of a lifetime or if everyone here knows something we don't and we're gonna get royally screwed.
01:11:56.083,01:11:59.291,Right. Remember that when you meet with the guys from Bear.
01:11:59.333,01:12:00.750,I set you up with a face-to-face.
01:12:00.792,01:12:02.500,Awesome.
01:12:02.542,01:12:06.917,"Holy shit. Five years ago, Securitization was a loser convention."
01:12:06.959,01:12:09.125,"100, maybe 200 people would show."
01:12:09.166,01:12:11.250,"$500 billion a year later, you get this."
01:12:11.291,01:12:13.125,"PORTER: There's a lot of smug-looking people in here, huh?"
01:12:13.166,01:12:16.542,It's like someone hit a pinata filled with white people who suck at golf.
01:12:16.583,01:12:17.750,"I mean, who are all these clowns?"
01:12:17.792,01:12:19.667,"DANNY: Oh, come on."
01:12:19.709,01:12:23.250,MARK: Certainly. Vennett says these are the people we're betting against.
01:12:23.291,01:12:25.166,"Yeah, here we go. Here we go."
01:12:25.208,01:12:27.375,"Chris, on my left."
01:12:27.417,01:12:28.458,Gentlemen.
01:12:28.500,01:12:32.083,When do we get a chance to face time with some of these lovely folks?
01:12:32.125,01:12:33.458,"Chris, give him the keycards."
01:12:33.500,01:12:34.583,Do you even know which keycards you're giving out?
01:12:34.625,01:12:36.166,You're just giving them out?
01:12:36.208,01:12:38.709,"First of all, how was your travel?"
01:12:38.750,01:12:40.333,-Uneventful.
01:12:40.375,01:12:42.083,I've been here for six hours.
01:12:40.375,01:12:45.208,"I've already been to the gym, I had two poached eggs and I played blackjack with Harry Dean Stanton."
01:12:45.250,01:12:47.125,MARK: Thank you for your diary.
01:12:47.166,01:12:48.542,Face time.
01:12:48.583,01:12:50.375,Just remember.
01:12:50.417,01:12:51.875,"We're gathering information, okay?"
01:12:51.917,01:12:54.333,We're not advertising our short position.
01:12:54.375,01:12:55.709,We don't want to spook everybody.
01:12:55.750,01:12:57.667,"I know you got a big mouth, you like to run it."
01:12:57.709,01:12:59.583,Can you just keep it shut for a few days?
01:12:59.625,01:13:00.583,Okay. Okay.
01:13:00.625,01:13:02.709,"Yeah, don't worry."
01:13:02.750,01:13:04.083,Ladies and gentlemen.
01:13:04.125,01:13:06.333,Business is good.
01:13:06.375,01:13:13.458,Profits are strong and the mortgage continues to be the bedrock on which this economy is built.
01:13:17.875,01:13:25.709,"And, yes, we had to take some losses in our subprime department last year, but those losses will be contained at only 5%."
01:13:25.750,01:13:27.917,"Now, in our residential sector..."
01:13:27.959,01:13:29.166,"VINNIE: Mark, it's not a Q and A."
01:13:29.208,01:13:32.709,...our rollout of those variable rate packages were gobbled up by the consumers!
01:13:32.750,01:13:34.875,"MARK: I have a question, please."
01:13:36.583,01:13:37.709,Uh...
01:13:37.750,01:13:39.291,"Sir, the Q and A is after my statements."
01:13:39.333,01:13:42.375,But you know what?
01:13:42.417,01:13:44.375,-Thank you. How are you?
01:13:44.417,01:13:52.208,Would you say that it is a possibility or a probability that subprime losses stop at 5%?
01:13:52.250,01:13:53.583,Thank you.
01:13:53.625,01:13:58.875,"I would say it is a very strong probability, indeed."
01:13:58.917,01:14:01.542,So back to the residential sector.
01:14:01.583,01:14:03.709,When we rolled out the new variable rates package...
01:14:03.750,01:14:06.333,MARK: Excuse me.
01:14:07.792,01:14:08.917,"Yes, sir."
01:14:08.959,01:14:12.417,Zero! Zero!
01:14:12.458,01:14:19.125,There is a 0% chance that your subprime losses will stop at 5%.
01:14:19.166,01:14:20.291,Zero.
01:14:20.333,01:14:21.917,Excuse me.
01:14:21.959,01:14:22.959,I have to take this.
01:14:23.000,01:14:25.083,MAN: He must be from Bank of America.
01:14:27.166,01:14:28.250,MAN: Our subprime department is fine.
01:14:28.291,01:14:29.667,"No, I'm not doing anything right now."
01:14:29.709,01:14:31.458,"MAN: As I was saying, our residential department..."
01:14:31.500,01:14:32.709,How are the kids?
01:14:32.750,01:14:34.834,MAN: ...consumers reacted to our packages...
01:14:34.875,01:14:36.583,Mark Baum really did that.
01:14:36.625,01:14:37.583,"When we were in Vegas, he did that."
01:14:37.625,01:14:40.542,"He said that, he took the call."
01:14:40.583,01:14:42.583,Now you see what I had to deal with?
01:14:56.000,01:14:58.166,"Yeah, the Beretta... Meh."
01:14:58.208,01:15:00.458,But this Uzi is fucking awesome!
01:15:00.500,01:15:03.166,I need this CDO machine to run for another two years.
01:15:03.208,01:15:06.500,And then I'm rich as fuck and I got my house in Aspen.
01:15:06.542,01:15:11.417,But do you have any concerns about the performance of the underlying securitizations?
01:15:11.458,01:15:16.291,It's easy to see that delinquencies and default rates are on the rise right now.
01:15:16.333,01:15:18.834,"Could you please stop being such a buzzkill, dude?"
01:15:18.875,01:15:21.333,"We didn't bring you out here to talk about work, bro."
01:15:21.375,01:15:22.959,Why did you bring us out here?
01:15:23.000,01:15:26.291,Because we need to be able to expense the ammo to a client.
01:15:26.333,01:15:29.500,I'm gonna go shoot some terrorists.
01:15:29.542,01:15:30.875,CHARLIE: These guys are morons.
01:15:30.917,01:15:32.834,Fucking tool.
01:15:32.875,01:15:34.000,These guys are morons.
01:15:35.083,01:15:36.166,"Fuck, yes! Boom!"
01:15:36.291,01:15:38.000,"Yeah, man!"
01:15:38.041,01:15:40.041,We need to be buying up every swap we can get our hands on here.
01:15:40.083,01:15:42.417,"Just hold on, okay? Hold on."
01:15:42.458,01:15:44.834,My brother's ex-girlfriend works for the SEC.
01:15:44.875,01:15:46.333,"She just told me she's in town, okay?"
01:15:46.375,01:15:49.000,"So, if we're missing something, maybe she can tell me."
01:15:49.041,01:15:50.709,"You know, give me some insight."
01:15:50.750,01:15:54.667,"In the meantime, you go to the main floor and price some swaps."
01:15:54.709,01:15:58.792,"actually, we're about to invest in housing bonds, and..."
01:15:58.834,01:16:01.542,I was wondering if the SEC is worried about them at all.
01:16:01.583,01:16:04.375,"I know you're not allowed to tell me specifics, but just generally."
01:16:04.417,01:16:06.667,"Oh, we don't investigate mortgage bonds."
01:16:06.709,01:16:10.125,"Truth is, since we got our budget cut, we don't investigate much."
01:16:12.083,01:16:13.583,Then why are you here?
01:16:13.625,01:16:15.083,I'm not here for the SEC.
01:16:15.125,01:16:16.625,I'm here on my own dime.
01:16:17.750,01:16:21.041,I'm floating my resume to some big banks.
01:16:21.083,01:16:22.709,"How's your brother, by the way?"
01:16:22.750,01:16:24.667,How are you floating your resume to big banks?
01:16:24.709,01:16:27.125,"I mean, you're supposed to be the ones, you know, policing the big banks."
01:16:27.166,01:16:29.000,"Grow up, Jamie."
01:16:29.041,01:16:36.166,"There must be some kind of law against working for a financial institution right after you've been working in financial regulation, right?"
01:16:36.208,01:16:38.375,No. No.
01:16:42.792,01:16:45.792,Hey! Come over here.
01:16:45.834,01:16:47.333,He's at Goldman.
01:16:47.667,01:16:49.125,See you.
01:16:49.166,01:16:54.166,We can do BBB-level swaps at 500 basis points. Maybe.
01:16:54.208,01:17:00.959,You're pricing the swaps like the bond is gonna collapse even though the bond value's going up? Really?
01:17:01.000,01:17:02.375,Sign of the times.
01:17:02.417,01:17:03.542,JAMIE: What the hell is going on?
01:18:02.041,01:18:05.875,"Lewis, can you come in early tomorrow, please?"
01:18:05.917,01:18:12.500,I need to unload the AIG and Countrywide and Freddie Mac positions so that we can afford the premiums on the...
01:18:13.625,01:18:16.959,...core mortgage shorts on the swaps.
01:18:17.000,01:18:18.583,"No problem, Dr. Burry."
01:18:20.542,01:18:21.792,-Dr. Burry?
01:18:25.333,01:18:29.250,"If the investors withdraw, what's going to happen here?"
01:18:29.291,01:18:31.291,"Honestly, I don't know."
01:18:38.875,01:18:41.208,The bonds aren't going down.
01:18:42.375,01:18:45.417,They won't move.
01:18:42.375,01:18:50.125,It's possible that we are in a completely fraudulent system.
01:18:58.917,01:18:59.834,Sure.
01:19:01.083,01:19:04.834,It's possible I'm wrong.
01:19:09.458,01:19:13.959,"I guess when someone's wrong, they never..."
01:19:14.000,01:19:16.333,They never know how.
01:19:20.583,01:19:21.667,LEWIS: See you in the morning.
01:19:21.709,01:19:22.834,Yeah.
01:19:24.542,01:19:27.083,Even Bear upped their prices.
01:19:27.125,01:19:29.667,And they keep calling us Brownhole.
01:19:29.709,01:19:31.125,You just don't have the money or the reputation.
01:19:31.166,01:19:32.500,Don't take it personally.
01:19:32.542,01:19:34.208,I don't think I have the strip club in me tonight.
01:19:34.250,01:19:38.000,I'm just gonna get some ginger ale and watch some pay-per-view.
01:19:38.041,01:19:40.333,I'll book us some flights out for the morning.
01:19:41.834,01:19:44.500,"We need a deal, right? A deal."
01:19:44.542,01:19:46.417,We need a deal we can afford.
01:19:46.458,01:19:48.792,We need a deal that they're not gonna refuse.
01:19:48.834,01:19:52.000,So... What can we do?
01:19:53.458,01:19:56.417,The AA tranches. What if we bet against the AA tranches?
01:19:56.458,01:19:58.500,Who's not gonna take that bet?
01:19:58.542,01:20:03.542,"We know they say they're 95% AAA-rated, but in reality they're more like 25%."
01:20:03.583,01:20:06.041,Some of them are 0%!
01:20:06.083,01:20:09.834,"We also know that if the bottom tranches fail at over 8%, the upper tranches are affected."
01:20:09.875,01:20:11.500,They go to zero.
01:20:11.542,01:20:14.917,I'll bet you right now that those AA's are actually like B's.
01:20:14.959,01:20:18.333,"I rarely ever say these words, but I think Charlie's right."
01:20:18.375,01:20:20.125,"Look, Ben."
01:20:21.750,01:20:24.959,The payoff is 200 to 1.
01:20:25.000,01:20:26.709,But they're all taking the ratings at face value.
01:20:26.750,01:20:32.291,So they're charging pennies on the dollar a bet against the AA's.
01:20:32.333,01:20:35.208,Just when I start thinking you guys are clowns...
01:20:35.250,01:20:37.792,No one on the planet's betting against AA's.
01:20:37.834,01:20:40.792,The banks will think we're either high or having a stroke.
01:20:40.834,01:20:43.250,They'll take every dime we have to offer.
01:20:45.750,01:20:47.166,Kinda brilliant.
01:20:48.875,01:20:51.000,This is what we did that no one else thought of.
01:20:51.041,01:20:54.000,Not even Baum or Burry thought to short the AA's.
01:20:54.041,01:20:55.458,But we did.
01:20:55.500,01:20:57.041,Little Brownhole Capital.
01:20:57.083,01:21:02.333,We're interested in shorting some of the AA tranche of CDOs.
01:21:02.375,01:21:03.917,"Come on, guys, what's the angle?"
01:21:03.959,01:21:06.667,"Oh, got no angle."
01:21:06.709,01:21:10.750,We want to do $15 million in swaps on the AA tranche.
01:21:10.792,01:21:11.959,I don't understand.
01:21:12.000,01:21:14.750,You can buy as much AA tranche as you want.
01:21:16.875,01:21:19.041,$40 million against the AA.
01:21:19.083,01:21:21.542,"Brother, I will sell you as much as you want."
01:21:21.583,01:21:24.834,"You understand perfectly, Bob."
01:21:26.000,01:21:28.000,That's cool.
01:21:30.166,01:21:31.458,Pleasure.
01:21:39.583,01:21:42.166,Don't do that. Stop. Stop.
01:21:42.208,01:21:43.500,-Stop that.
01:21:44.125,01:21:45.667,Stop it! Stop.
01:21:48.000,01:21:49.166,What?
01:21:50.542,01:21:52.291,Do you have any idea what you just did?
01:21:52.333,01:21:54.041,Come on. We just made the deal of our lifetimes!
01:21:54.083,01:21:55.250,We should celebrate.
01:21:55.291,01:21:57.291,You just bet against the American economy.
01:21:57.333,01:21:58.875,"Fuck, yeah, we did!"
01:21:58.917,01:22:00.917,"-Fuck, yeah!"
01:22:00.959,01:22:03.250,Which means if we're right...
01:22:04.667,01:22:08.083,"If we're right, people lose homes."
01:22:08.125,01:22:11.166,People lose retirement savings.
01:22:11.208,01:22:12.458,You know what I hate about fucking banking?
01:22:12.500,01:22:14.291,It reduces people to numbers. Here's a number.
01:22:14.333,01:22:17.166,"Every 1% unemployment goes up, 40,000 people die."
01:22:17.208,01:22:18.750,-No.
01:22:18.792,01:22:20.458,"No, I didn't know that."
01:22:21.834,01:22:23.583,We were just excited.
01:22:25.917,01:22:28.542,Just don't fucking dance.
01:22:28.583,01:22:30.500,CHARLIE: All right.
01:22:34.834,01:22:37.083,"Whoa, I just got really scared."
01:22:38.542,01:22:40.500,"First of all, great show today."
01:22:40.542,01:22:42.041,-You were terrific.
01:22:42.083,01:22:43.750,Your big mouth was a revelation.
01:22:43.792,01:22:45.583,I appreciate that.
01:22:45.625,01:22:47.417,You worried you and your swaps are getting played?
01:22:47.458,01:22:50.500,"Well, this is an opportunity for you to meet who you're betting against."
01:22:50.542,01:22:52.458,Try not to get too righteous and listen a little.
01:22:52.500,01:22:53.959,"Okay, fine. Who is this guy?"
01:22:54.000,01:22:55.834,JAMIE: A real solid-gold asshole.
01:22:55.875,01:22:57.041,I'm a CDO manager.
01:22:57.083,01:22:58.166,A CDO manager?
01:22:58.208,01:22:59.834,"Yeah, at Harding Advisors."
01:22:59.875,01:23:04.250,I didn't realize that there was anything to manage with CDOs.
01:23:04.291,01:23:05.208,MR. CHAU: Oh.
01:23:06.625,01:23:10.083,We select the securities that go into the CDO portfolio and monitor the assets.
01:23:10.125,01:23:11.959,I do most of Merrill Lynch's CDOs.
01:23:12.000,01:23:15.000,Do you represent the investors or Merrill Lynch?
01:23:15.041,01:23:16.125,The investors.
01:23:16.166,01:23:17.291,You do.
01:23:17.333,01:23:18.709,-Yeah.
01:23:18.750,01:23:25.458,Merrill Lynch isn't gonna send you any customers unless you put Merrill Lynch's bonds in your CDO.
01:23:25.500,01:23:28.792,"Good question. Let's just say Merrill and I have, um..."
01:23:28.834,01:23:31.000,We have a good relationship.
01:23:31.041,01:23:33.250,You have a good relationship with Merrill Lynch.
01:23:33.291,01:23:35.000,We've been doing business together for a long time.
01:23:35.041,01:23:41.625,And so the CDOs that you create are of the highest quality and the highest value.
01:23:41.667,01:23:43.625,-Absolutely. Yep.
01:23:43.667,01:23:47.291,Are you at all concerned about the rising default rates?
01:23:49.166,01:23:52.417,"I assume no risk for these products myself, Mark."
01:23:55.000,01:23:56.250,Okay.
01:23:57.625,01:24:01.500,So let me get this straight.
01:24:01.542,01:24:03.125,They give you the bonds they want to sell.
01:24:03.166,01:24:07.000,"They give you clients, they give you money to run your business."
01:24:07.041,01:24:08.792,Give you fat fees for doing so.
01:24:08.834,01:24:11.041,But you represent the investors?
01:24:12.375,01:24:13.333,Is that right?
01:24:13.375,01:24:14.583,Yeah.
01:24:14.625,01:24:15.834,But we're not in the Merrill Lynch building.
01:24:15.875,01:24:17.792,-Okay. Where are you?
01:24:17.834,01:24:19.959,You're 20 minutes away.
01:24:20.000,01:24:22.000,"Well, five if you use a helicopter."
01:24:23.834,01:24:25.041,"That's funny, huh?"
01:24:25.083,01:24:26.333,That's hilarious.
01:24:29.458,01:24:30.375,"Oh, boy."
01:24:31.250,01:24:33.125,Your boss is about to explode.
01:24:33.166,01:24:34.834,"No, he's too curious to explode."
01:24:34.875,01:24:36.375,Hold on. Say that again.
01:24:36.417,01:24:38.583,CDO A has parts of CDO B.
01:24:38.625,01:24:40.583,And CDO B has parts of CDO A.
01:24:40.625,01:24:42.917,But then they both get put inside CDO C.
01:24:42.959,01:24:44.792,"Yeah, that one's called CDO squared."
01:24:44.834,01:24:47.083,A CDO of a CDO.
01:24:47.125,01:24:48.458,All right?
01:24:48.500,01:24:52.291,And then there's CDOs made up of the opposite side of the bet you made with your swaps.
01:24:52.333,01:24:54.667,We call them synthetic CDOs.
01:24:54.709,01:24:56.917,What did you say?
01:24:56.959,01:24:58.750,That is fucking crazy.
01:24:58.792,01:25:00.125,It's not. It's awesome.
01:25:01.917,01:25:05.458,His face is starting to boil.
01:25:09.500,01:25:15.542,"All right, let's say you have a pool of $50 million in subprime loans."
01:25:15.583,01:25:22.792,"How much money could be out there betting on it, in your synthetic CDOs and swaps right now, tonight?"
01:25:22.834,01:25:25.542,"Let's see, $50 million..."
01:25:26.458,01:25:27.458,A billion dollars.
01:25:27.500,01:25:28.417,What?
01:25:30.083,01:25:32.875,JARED: If the mortgage bonds that Michael Burry discovered were the match...
01:25:34.417,01:25:38.417,How much bigger is the market for insuring mortgage bonds than actual mortgages?
01:25:39.500,01:25:40.834,About 20 times.
01:25:40.875,01:25:50.959,"JARED: If the mortgage bonds were the match and the CDOs were the kerosene-soaked rags, then the synthetic CDO was the atomic bomb with the drunk President holding his finger over the button."
01:25:51.041,01:25:59.083,It was at that moment in that dumb restaurant with that stupid look on his face that Mark Baum realized that the whole world economy might collapse.
01:26:02.625,01:26:04.583,And I know what you're thinking.
01:26:04.625,01:26:07.000,What the fuck is a synthetic CDO?
01:26:09.959,01:26:16.000,"Well, here's Dr. Richard Thaler, father of behavioral economics and Selena Gomez to explain."
01:26:16.041,01:26:19.208,Okay. So here's how a synthetic CDO works.
01:26:19.250,01:26:22.166,Let's say I bet $10 million on a blackjack hand.
01:26:22.208,01:26:27.417,$10 million because this hand is meant to represent a single mortgage bond.
01:26:30.291,01:26:33.750,"Okay, Selena has a pretty good hand here, showing 18."
01:26:33.792,01:26:34.834,Dealer showing seven.
01:26:34.875,01:26:37.041,That's a really good hand for Selena.
01:26:37.083,01:26:41.000,"Good odds. In fact, her chances of winning this hand are 87%."
01:26:41.041,01:26:44.458,"So, my odds are good."
01:26:44.500,01:26:47.208,Everybody in this place wants to get in on the action.
01:26:47.250,01:26:48.667,"How could I lose, right?"
01:26:48.709,01:26:50.250,"Now, this is a classic error."
01:26:50.291,01:26:53.291,In basketball it's called the Hot Hand Fallacy.
01:26:53.333,01:26:55.917,A player makes a bunch of shots in a row.
01:26:55.959,01:26:58.333,People are sure they're gonna make the next one.
01:26:58.375,01:27:03.166,People think that whatever's happening now is gonna continue to happen into the future.
01:27:03.208,01:27:08.041,"During the real estate boom, markets were going up and up and people thought they would never go down."
01:27:08.083,01:27:12.208,So people who are watching and think that I won't lose will make a side bet.
01:27:12.250,01:27:14.834,"Now, this is the first synthetic CDO."
01:27:14.875,01:27:16.500,I love Selena Gomez.
01:27:16.542,01:27:18.125,I bet you $50 million she wins.
01:27:18.166,01:27:20.291,And I'll give you 3-to-1 odds.
01:27:20.333,01:27:24.208,3-to-1 odds?
01:27:24.250,01:27:28.875,"RICHARD: Now, somebody else is gonna want to make a bet on the outcome of their bet."
01:27:28.917,01:27:30.083,Bet you 50 million she wins.
01:27:30.125,01:27:33.166,That will lead to synthetic CDO number two.
01:27:33.208,01:27:37.834,"Hey, I bet you $200 million that lady in the glasses wins that bet."
01:27:37.875,01:27:41.417,She probably will win.
01:27:41.458,01:27:42.417,How about 20-to-1?
01:27:42.458,01:27:44.083,Deal.
01:27:44.125,01:27:48.458,And this will go on and on with more and more synthetic CDOs.
01:27:48.500,01:27:54.709,And we can transform an original $10 million investment into billions of dollars.
01:27:55.542,01:27:56.959,You okay?
01:27:58.291,01:27:59.375,No.
01:28:00.667,01:28:03.166,I actually feel pretty sick.
01:28:07.750,01:28:09.750,So I'm going to leave.
01:28:11.250,01:28:14.166,"You think I'm a parasite, don't you, Mr. Baum?"
01:28:14.208,01:28:19.125,"But, apparently, society values me very much."
01:28:19.166,01:28:21.000,"In fact, let's do this."
01:28:22.959,01:28:26.458,I'll tell you how much I'm worth.
01:28:26.500,01:28:27.667,You tell me how much you're worth.
01:28:29.208,01:28:34.375,"God, you are an incredibly big piece of shit."
01:28:40.041,01:28:41.959,Short everything that guy has touched.
01:28:42.000,01:28:44.125,I want half a billion more in swaps.
01:28:44.166,01:28:46.458,You sure about that?
01:28:46.500,01:28:47.458,MARK: Yeah. Yeah.
01:28:47.500,01:28:48.625,Where are you going?
01:28:48.667,01:28:53.625,I am going to try to find moral redemption at the roulette table.
01:29:57.709,01:29:59.166,"Hey, hey, hey!"
01:30:03.166,01:30:04.709,Things are worse than I thought.
01:30:06.750,01:30:09.000,I honestly think the economy might collapse.
01:30:09.041,01:30:13.792,"But you've been saying that the system's broken for years, Mark. So..."
01:30:13.834,01:30:15.834,Why are you so shocked?
01:30:18.291,01:30:21.750,It's more twisted than I could have imagined.
01:30:21.792,01:30:24.083,You love to be the virtuous one.
01:30:24.125,01:30:25.792,I'm a banker.
01:30:25.834,01:30:28.166,"You always have, Mark."
01:30:28.208,01:30:32.166,It changed me.
01:30:28.208,01:30:34.083,It changed me into a person who is not able to reach out to someone...
01:30:34.125,01:30:36.625,He was in pain.
01:30:36.667,01:30:39.083,There's no perfect way to help.
01:30:42.000,01:30:44.542,It's sad. It's scary.
01:30:44.583,01:30:47.792,So stop trying to fix the world.
01:30:47.834,01:30:48.959,He told me...
01:30:49.000,01:30:50.375,You're not a saint.
01:30:50.417,01:30:52.333,Saints don't live on Park Avenue.
01:30:52.375,01:30:53.750,...that he was having bad thoughts.
01:30:53.792,01:30:57.166,CYNTHIA: Just feel the feelings like the rest of us.
01:30:57.208,01:31:01.709,MARK: My first response was to offer him some money.
01:31:01.750,01:31:04.625,I offered him fucking money!
01:31:09.917,01:31:12.583,His face was so smashed.
01:31:31.583,01:31:33.000,That's right.
01:32:39.583,01:32:40.959,MICHAEL'S WIFE: Michael?
01:32:41.000,01:32:42.375,-Michael?
01:32:42.417,01:32:43.500,Is everything okay?
01:32:43.542,01:32:44.542,"Yes, honey."
01:32:44.583,01:32:45.625,You sure?
01:32:45.667,01:32:46.792,"Yeah, baby."
01:32:58.792,01:33:00.500,MIKE: To all investors.
01:33:00.542,01:33:09.625,"As you may know, our agreement allows me to take extraordinary measures when markets aren't functioning properly."
01:33:09.667,01:33:15.875,I currently have reason to believe the mortgage bond market is fraudulent.
01:33:17.625,01:33:28.083,"So, in order to protect investors from this fraudulent market, I've decided to restrict investors' withdrawals until further notice."
01:33:28.125,01:33:31.875,"Sincerely, Dr. Michael J. Burry."
01:34:39.417,01:34:42.792,I never would have guessed my life could change as much as it has since I moved to L.A.
01:34:42.834,01:34:46.083,"JASON WAHLER: It's not just, like, that easy to, like, not see you."
01:34:46.125,01:34:49.333,REPORTER: He lashed out at rumors he used performance enhancing drugs.
01:34:49.375,01:34:50.834,This record is not tainted.
01:34:50.875,01:34:52.041,"Oh, my God, dude."
01:34:52.083,01:34:53.875,Will you please stop changing the channels?
01:34:53.917,01:34:55.583,-You're driving me crazy.
01:34:55.625,01:34:58.500,-Fine.
01:34:58.542,01:34:59.750,REPORTER: ... and the S&amp;P picked up three points.
01:34:59.792,01:35:00.834,Jesus!
01:35:00.875,01:35:02.166,Mortgage meltdown continued today.
01:35:02.208,01:35:08.250,"Subprime mortgage lender New Century Financial, once the industry leader, by the way, filed for bankruptcy."
01:35:08.291,01:35:09.417,-The company immediately...
01:35:10.542,01:35:12.041,Good time for my voice to go...
01:35:12.083,01:35:14.375,"Fired 3,200 workers."
01:35:14.417,01:35:16.709,The manufacturing index also fell in the month of March...
01:35:16.750,01:35:18.083,It's starting.
01:35:18.125,01:35:19.166,...a warning that economic growth could slow.
01:35:19.208,01:35:22.709,The Institute of Supply Management also reported a rise in prices...
01:35:22.750,01:35:24.458,I'm gonna call my mom.
01:35:26.208,01:35:29.542,The principal source of the slowdown in economic growth...
01:35:29.583,01:35:33.959,"Time and time and time again, I have gone to bat for you, Mark!"
01:35:34.000,01:35:35.208,We've known each other for seven years...
01:35:35.250,01:35:38.834,She's got some lungs on her. I'm impressed.
01:35:38.875,01:35:40.208,I can't help but enjoy it.
01:35:41.667,01:35:45.792,PORTER: There's no fucking way. There's no fucking way that the big banks are that stupid.
01:35:45.834,01:35:47.750,"Bye, Kathy!"
01:35:52.333,01:35:53.250,VINNIE: Well?
01:35:55.250,01:35:58.000,that it would be a good idea if we sold our shorts.
01:35:58.041,01:35:59.333,PORTER: What else is new?
01:35:59.375,01:36:01.250,And she said that Morgan Stanley will buy them.
01:36:01.291,01:36:02.333,DANNY: Holy shit!
01:36:02.959,01:36:04.250,What did you say?
01:36:04.291,01:36:06.041,I told her we're not selling shit.
01:36:12.166,01:36:16.125,"Uh, if you need the files for 2005..."
01:36:16.166,01:36:19.875,Mr. Fields' suit is very specific to files from the past year.
01:36:19.917,01:36:22.709,Good. Then get out.
01:36:22.750,01:36:24.083,Will do.
01:36:26.959,01:36:28.709,You can't call me back for a week?
01:36:28.750,01:36:30.417,"LUCY: I am so sorry, Mike."
01:36:30.458,01:36:34.166,Goldman had a systems failure.
01:36:34.208,01:36:39.625,"Yeah, B of A said they had a power outage, and Morgan Stanley said their server crashed."
01:36:39.667,01:36:40.667,Huh. That's weird.
01:36:40.709,01:36:43.458,"Well, I would call it improbable."
01:36:43.500,01:36:47.792,So where do you have our position marked?
01:36:47.834,01:36:49.625,"I think it's the same, Mike."
01:36:49.667,01:36:59.291,"What? Can you explain that to me, please, because how can the value of an insurance contract not be affected by the demise of the very thing it insures?"
01:36:59.333,01:37:02.083,They're independent markets.
01:37:02.125,01:37:06.542,"I know it sounds odd, but these are very complicated products."
01:37:06.583,01:37:08.250,They are correlated.
01:37:08.291,01:37:11.709,"They're gonna lose their houses, they're gonna lose their jobs, they're gonna lose their..."
01:37:14.542,01:37:16.542,Will you listen to me?
01:37:16.583,01:37:19.291,This is like the end of capitalism.
01:37:19.333,01:37:23.667,This is like the Dark Ages all over again.
01:37:23.709,01:37:24.750,I don't want to talk to Dad.
01:37:24.792,01:37:28.083,"Okay, I love you, too."
01:37:28.125,01:37:32.250,She says I need to be on Xanax and double my dose of Zoloft.
01:37:32.291,01:37:34.333,I asked Bear Stearns to price our shorts.
01:37:34.375,01:37:36.000,They tell me the CDOs still haven't moved.
01:37:36.041,01:37:37.875,CHARLIE: This is fucking insane!
01:37:37.917,01:37:39.458,You realize that?
01:37:37.917,01:37:41.667,These people are crooks and they should be in prison.
01:37:41.709,01:37:42.834,Look at the TABX.
01:37:42.875,01:37:44.792,You can see that the CDOs are worth zero!
01:37:44.834,01:37:45.875,"So you know what they're doing, huh?"
01:37:45.917,01:37:46.750,"You know what they're doing, right?"
01:37:46.792,01:37:48.458,Yeah. They're unloading them.
01:37:48.500,01:37:54.417,"They're selling their dog shit CDOs, then they go to another bank and short the shit they just fucking sold!"
01:37:54.458,01:37:56.125,"Let's go to the press, man!"
01:37:56.166,01:38:00.375,This is a massive story.
01:38:00.417,01:38:02.125,Robert Redford!
01:38:02.166,01:38:03.667,"No, you don't understand!"
01:38:03.709,01:38:05.333,"CASEY: I got it, guys."
01:38:07.000,01:38:08.542,What am I supposed to do?
01:38:08.583,01:38:10.375,Do you want me to write a piece called We're All Fucked?
01:38:10.417,01:38:12.083,Yes! That's a perfect title!
01:38:12.125,01:38:18.417,"Casey, right now every bank in town is unloading these shit bonds onto unsuspecting customers."
01:38:18.458,01:38:21.583,And they won't devalue them until they get them off their books.
01:38:21.625,01:38:26.291,"This level of criminality is unprecedented, even on fucking Wall Street."
01:38:27.542,01:38:30.625,"Jamie... And this is me being honest here, okay?"
01:38:30.667,01:38:33.250,It took me years to build my relationships on Wall Street.
01:38:33.291,01:38:40.166,No bank or ratings agency is going to confirm a story like this just because it comes from two guys in a...
01:38:40.208,01:38:43.583,"Sorry, garage band hedge fund that thinks it's the apocalypse."
01:38:45.125,01:38:46.166,Wow.
01:38:46.208,01:38:47.333,"I thought you were for real, Casey."
01:38:47.375,01:38:48.834,"You know, I'll have to say I really did."
01:38:48.875,01:38:50.375,CASEY: Really?
01:38:50.417,01:38:54.625,"Yeah, Jamie, you try being for real with a three-year-old and a wife getting her master's degree."
01:38:54.667,01:38:58.792,I'm not gonna burn my reputation on your wild hunch.
01:38:58.834,01:39:00.125,Wow.
01:39:00.166,01:39:01.458,Wow.
01:39:01.500,01:39:02.500,"Thanks for coming, guys."
01:39:02.542,01:39:03.542,Totally fucking awesome to see you.
01:39:03.583,01:39:06.000,"Yeah, Casey."
01:39:03.583,01:39:10.875,"I've always hated you, because you were a prick in college and you are a prick today!"
01:39:10.917,01:39:13.917,"Thanks, Charlie."
01:39:13.959,01:39:15.458,"JAMIE: Charlie, come on!"
01:39:15.500,01:39:17.959,MARK: Mark Baum again. Call me.
01:39:18.000,01:39:19.667,Subprime bonds fell off a cliff.
01:39:19.709,01:39:21.709,Rumor has it the default numbers are huge.
01:39:21.750,01:39:24.625,Who got the remittance data early?
01:39:24.667,01:39:25.834,"VINNIE: Yeah, fuck you very much."
01:39:25.875,01:39:29.291,"Jared, it's chaos down here."
01:39:29.333,01:39:34.041,"And Caesar wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer."
01:39:34.083,01:39:35.375,Shane?
01:39:35.709,01:39:37.041,Shane?
01:39:38.458,01:39:42.792,"Well, nobody's buying CDO or mortgage bonds anymore and everybody wants swaps."
01:39:42.834,01:39:45.333,Swaps are now the most popular product on the street.
01:39:45.375,01:39:47.291,-That's good for us.
01:39:47.333,01:39:48.792,I heard from somebody who heard from somebody...
01:39:48.834,01:39:51.625,"No, Alex, no. Sorry."
01:39:54.709,01:39:58.291,Bennie Cleager over at Morgan is taking on some heavy losses in the bond department.
01:39:59.709,01:40:01.709,Your ship might be taking on water.
01:40:01.750,01:40:04.792,It might be time to get our lifejacket and get out.
01:40:04.834,01:40:05.834,I'm jacked.
01:40:06.875,01:40:10.000,I'm jacked!
01:40:10.041,01:40:10.875,Good.
01:40:10.917,01:40:13.291,- Do you feel it?
01:40:19.375,01:40:20.917,"What'd you hear, Tommy?"
01:40:23.000,01:40:23.959,It's happening.
01:40:24.000,01:40:26.083,PORTER: Everybody wants our swaps.
01:40:26.125,01:40:28.417,Kathy's office is looking for you.
01:40:28.458,01:40:32.208,"DANNY: They're singing a different tune now, aren't they?"
01:40:32.250,01:40:33.834,That's not good.
01:40:38.583,01:40:40.000,Maybe later. Not now.
01:40:40.041,01:40:42.583,This is a joke. Never.
01:40:45.959,01:40:47.417,Listening.
01:40:47.458,01:40:49.083,DEEB: Dr. Burry?
01:40:49.125,01:40:50.375,"Deeb Winston, Goldman Sachs."
01:40:50.417,01:40:52.000,"Listen, I've been reviewing your position."
01:40:52.041,01:40:54.542,I wanted to discuss your marks and make sure they're fair.
01:40:54.583,01:41:00.333,you mean that you've secured a net short position yourselves.
01:41:00.375,01:41:06.041,So you're free to mark my swaps accurately for once because it's now in your interest to do so.
01:41:08.125,01:41:10.333,I'm not sure what you want me to say.
01:41:10.375,01:41:11.959,I think that...
01:41:13.375,01:41:15.542,I think that you've already said it.
01:41:23.333,01:41:25.500,You tell Jeff at Goldman that I'm not transferring funds.
01:41:25.542,01:41:27.250,This is bullshit!
01:41:34.333,01:41:36.542,"Okay, we'll talk later."
01:41:36.583,01:41:38.083,Thank you.
01:41:40.500,01:41:42.417,"Thanks for coming so quickly, Mark."
01:41:42.458,01:41:44.041,Yeah.
01:41:44.083,01:41:46.959,I know you've been hearing rumblings about some losses Morgan has suffered.
01:41:47.000,01:41:49.542,-Congratulations.
01:41:49.583,01:41:50.709,Oh.
01:41:51.333,01:41:52.875,Thanks. Um...
01:41:52.917,01:41:54.333,Having fun?
01:41:57.875,01:41:58.792,Tons. Um...
01:41:59.917,01:42:02.583,"I just wanted you to know that, um..."
01:42:02.625,01:42:08.333,"That, yes, Morgan has suffered some losses, but our liquidity is strong and there's no cause for concern."
01:42:08.375,01:42:11.500,Would Bennie Cleager be concerned?
01:42:11.542,01:42:15.875,Because word on the street is that he took some pretty heavy losses.
01:42:17.125,01:42:18.917,"Kathy, come on."
01:42:18.959,01:42:21.583,What's going on?
01:42:21.625,01:42:23.250,How bad is this?
01:42:23.291,01:42:24.208,Okay.
01:42:25.750,01:42:31.959,"Two years ago, Bennie Cleager in Morgan's bond department also started shorting subprime housing, $2 billion in BBBs."
01:42:32.041,01:42:33.291,Bennie is smarter than I thought.
01:42:33.333,01:42:34.667,"No, he's not smart at all."
01:42:34.709,01:42:37.250,The premiums on the swap ate into his desk's profit.
01:42:37.291,01:42:41.834,"To cover his BBB shorts, he sold a lot of A and AA swaps as protection."
01:42:41.875,01:42:42.792,A lot.
01:42:44.417,01:42:47.375,He believed that there was no way that they could be affected.
01:42:47.417,01:42:50.834,Tell me Morgan Stanley doesn't hold the contracts on these swaps.
01:42:54.083,01:42:55.000,Holy shit.
01:42:56.750,01:43:01.792,"All this time I've been trying to figure out who I'm betting against, and it's Morgan Stanley."
01:43:02.667,01:43:04.083,Which is me.
01:43:05.750,01:43:08.959,What's your exposure?
01:43:09.000,01:43:10.959,"Please, don't tell me it's more than four."
01:43:11.000,01:43:12.667,I can't answer that.
01:43:12.709,01:43:19.375,"Yes, you can answer that, because I walk in here and people are crying in your hallway."
01:43:19.417,01:43:25.041,"Kathy, you bring me in to tell me everything's fine, and everything's not fine."
01:43:25.083,01:43:27.041,"What, what is happening?"
01:43:29.208,01:43:31.458,The long exposure is...
01:43:33.291,01:43:34.875,...$15 billion.
01:43:40.667,01:43:41.875,Jesus!
01:43:41.917,01:43:44.250,He kept saying defaults over 8% were impossible.
01:43:44.291,01:43:45.417,"MARK: Oh, my God."
01:43:45.458,01:43:46.750,That there would be a million homeless!
01:43:48.166,01:43:50.500,"Yeah, but we have nothing to do with Morgan Stanley."
01:43:53.333,01:43:54.750,Yeah...
01:43:54.792,01:43:56.834,Tell the bankruptcy court.
01:43:56.875,01:44:00.583,"Morgan fails, all our accounts go on their balance sheet."
01:44:00.625,01:44:02.417,DANNY: It's just crazy.
01:44:02.458,01:44:06.667,Morgan makes the sucker's bet and we pay their fucking gambling debt?
01:44:06.709,01:44:09.291,Short the bank stocks.
01:44:13.166,01:44:15.250,Or we sell our swaps when the market opens.
01:44:16.917,01:44:20.000,"We get our bonuses, our investors get their profits, we get..."
01:44:20.041,01:44:22.792,"What, 30 cents on the dollar?"
01:44:22.834,01:44:24.083,We're three times that.
01:44:24.125,01:44:25.417,Not if there's no market left to sell them in.
01:44:25.458,01:44:28.125,Forget it.
01:44:28.166,01:44:30.583,"VINNIE: If Morgan goes under, we end up with nothing."
01:44:30.625,01:44:31.709,Vinnie.
01:44:33.417,01:44:36.667,"Jesus, come on."
01:44:40.709,01:44:45.500,"Look, I get that this is personal for you, but we have a fiduciary responsibility."
01:44:45.542,01:44:47.291,"No. No, we don't."
01:44:47.333,01:44:49.625,Nobody's acting responsible.
01:44:49.667,01:44:52.875,Fuck responsibility.
01:44:52.917,01:44:55.083,The assholes at the big banks will take...
01:44:55.125,01:44:56.208,WOMAN: You boys want any appetizers?
01:44:56.250,01:44:58.709,"MARK: We're talking, please!"
01:44:58.750,01:45:00.000,-Excuse us.
01:45:02.375,01:45:10.959,"We are going to wait, and we are going to wait, and we are going to wait until they feel the pain, until they start to bleed."
01:45:11.000,01:45:13.166,-That is what I want.
01:45:11.000,01:45:14.542,-But what about our clients who've entrusted us with their savings...
01:45:14.583,01:45:15.750,I say when we sell.
01:45:15.792,01:45:16.959,This isn't about you.
01:45:17.000,01:45:19.500,This isn't about you and your Upper East Side -mahogany soapbox.
01:45:19.542,01:45:20.959,I say when we sell!
01:45:22.458,01:45:24.291,"DANNY: Whatever you say, Mark."
01:45:30.917,01:45:32.792,"Dude, did you hear the news?"
01:45:34.542,01:45:42.041,"Okay. So, not only do two mortgage hedge funds backed by Bear Stearns go belly up, but now there's a class-action lawsuit against Bear."
01:45:42.083,01:45:43.291,CHARLIE: Holy shit!
01:45:43.333,01:45:45.875,Let's go! Push! Push!
01:45:45.917,01:45:47.417,"So, what? Bear could really collapse here."
01:45:47.458,01:45:48.625,-This is a risk we really shouldn't take.
01:45:48.667,01:45:51.333,JAMIE: We bought 80% of our swaps at Bear.
01:45:51.375,01:45:53.000,We'd lose everything.
01:45:53.041,01:45:54.542,"-Hey, sir?"
01:45:54.583,01:45:55.458,That's my opinion.
01:45:55.500,01:45:56.458,We bought these fucking things.
01:45:56.500,01:45:57.500,We have no clue how to sell them.
01:45:57.542,01:46:00.250,I know. We have to get Ben to do it.
01:46:00.291,01:46:01.500,I've been trying to call him and he won't get back to me.
01:46:01.542,01:46:04.083,No. He's on vacation with his wife's family.
01:46:04.125,01:46:05.375,They're in England.
01:46:06.166,01:46:07.333,What?
01:46:14.959,01:46:16.583,"JAMIE: Hello, Ben. Hey."
01:46:16.625,01:46:18.250,"Yeah, we're here."
01:46:18.291,01:46:19.709,-Guys?
01:46:19.750,01:46:23.917,BEN: Yeah. I hardly got cell phone or Wi-Fi service.
01:46:23.959,01:46:26.834,I'm trying to sell $200 million worth of securities.
01:46:26.875,01:46:29.083,In a pub.
01:46:29.125,01:46:30.417,You can do this.
01:46:30.458,01:46:34.834,"CHARLIE: I don't want to pressure you, Ben but if you don't pull this off, we lose everything."
01:46:34.875,01:46:38.000,All right. Let's see what Credit Suisse's appetite is.
01:46:43.125,01:46:44.166,This is Brownfield Fund.
01:46:44.208,01:46:46.583,I want to unload my credit default swaps.
01:46:46.625,01:46:48.291,MAN: All right.
01:46:48.333,01:46:50.583,Twenty AA tranches of A.B.S. CDOs.
01:46:50.625,01:46:53.125,MAN: A.B.S.?
01:46:53.166,01:46:55.417,Absolutely.
01:46:55.458,01:46:57.000,What's your notional value?
01:46:57.041,01:46:59.959,Face value is 205 million.
01:47:00.000,01:47:02.625,"All right, we could, we could go to forty."
01:47:02.667,01:47:04.041,No. We want at least 100 million.
01:47:04.083,01:47:07.834,"100 million? Who are you, a drug dealer or a banker?"
01:47:07.875,01:47:10.417,"'Cause if you're a banker, you can fuck right off!"
01:47:10.458,01:47:11.417,I don't know if we can make a market.
01:47:11.458,01:47:12.500,BEN: Just give me your best price?
01:47:12.542,01:47:15.458,"Yeah. Chuck 100 million in for me, mate."
01:47:15.500,01:47:17.000,I think we're far apart.
01:47:17.041,01:47:19.750,"Look, if you don't want the deal, you can just hang up."
01:47:22.125,01:47:23.750,That's what I thought.
01:47:24.458,01:47:26.542,-90 million.
01:47:29.542,01:47:31.583,-78.
01:47:32.709,01:47:34.792,-78.
01:47:36.542,01:47:38.083,MIKE: It's Dr. Burry.
01:47:38.125,01:47:42.208,Looks like the collapse of the financial sector is imminent.
01:47:42.250,01:47:44.542,Let's start to sell my position.
01:47:44.583,01:47:46.500,It's $1.3 billion.
01:47:47.917,01:47:49.834,"Sure, I'll hold."
01:48:13.583,01:48:14.792,"So, I was right."
01:48:15.959,01:48:21.041,"I took a rash of shit for two years, but I was right."
01:48:21.083,01:48:22.458,And everyone was wrong.
01:48:23.750,01:48:27.417,"And, yeah, I got a bonus check for it."
01:48:27.458,01:48:28.375,You know?
01:48:29.875,01:48:32.750,It's a lot of money. I get it.
01:48:32.792,01:48:33.709,That's palpable.
01:48:35.125,01:48:39.375,"But, hey, I never said I was the hero of this story."
01:48:39.417,01:48:42.041,"JAMIE: Hey, Ben."
01:48:43.166,01:48:45.208,Eight...on...
01:48:45.250,01:48:46.333,Sorry?
01:48:46.959,01:48:49.250,No. Eighty million.
01:48:49.291,01:48:50.959,"$80 million, $80 million, that's good, right?"
01:48:51.000,01:48:51.875,Eighty is great.
01:48:51.917,01:48:52.792,"-Eighty is great, Ben."
01:48:52.834,01:48:56.083,Thank you.
01:48:56.125,01:48:58.083,Most of it went to UBS.
01:48:58.125,01:48:59.917,You're very lucky.
01:48:58.125,01:49:03.041,The largest bank in France froze customer's money market accounts today.
01:49:03.083,01:49:04.667,This thing's hitting Europe.
01:49:04.709,01:49:06.583,Greece and Iceland are finished.
01:49:06.625,01:49:08.000,Spain is teetering.
01:49:08.041,01:49:10.000,Are you serious?
01:49:10.041,01:49:11.917,"CHARLIE: Ben, call us when you get home."
01:49:11.959,01:49:15.959,"But, hey, before you go, uh, I'm just wondering..."
01:49:16.000,01:49:17.333,Um...
01:49:18.458,01:49:20.583,Why did you do this with us?
01:49:21.458,01:49:23.750,You didn't have to. Uh...
01:49:23.792,01:49:26.917,"Thank you. But, uh, why?"
01:49:28.375,01:49:31.792,You guys said you wanted to get rich.
01:49:31.834,01:49:33.041,COMMENTATOR: Goal!
01:49:33.083,01:49:34.917,Pamplona puts themselves on the scoreboard.
01:49:38.792,01:49:43.917,"JARED: As the housing markets and banks continued to hemorrhage, only one of the big shorts refused to sell."
01:49:43.959,01:49:45.250,Mark Baum.
01:49:48.542,01:49:55.375,"So it was beyond perfect when he was asked to speak at a conference opposite Bruce Miller, the famous bullish investor."
01:49:55.417,01:50:01.375,"After he and Mark had their debate, Alan Greenspan, one of the architects of the whole crisis was scheduled to speak."
01:50:01.417,01:50:04.041,"Everyone in Mark's office showed up, he even invited friends."
01:50:05.542,01:50:09.125,This was the Ali vs. Foreman of the financial world.
01:50:09.166,01:50:11.583,The realist versus the fools.
01:50:11.625,01:50:14.917,"And if it seems almost too perfect, trust me, this happened."
01:50:17.333,01:50:23.834,"Welcome, everyone."
01:50:17.333,01:50:27.792,Please give a generous welcome to Mr. Bruce Miller and Mark Baum.
01:50:44.333,01:50:46.166,Strap yourself in.
01:50:47.375,01:50:52.250,"So as some of you may know, Bear Stearns has just received a loan from JP Morgan."
01:50:52.291,01:50:59.000,"Of course, we're gonna have to wait and see how the markets react, but that should lay to rest any concerns about the bank's health."
01:50:59.041,01:51:04.041,"Now, I take it you have no plans to sell your $200 million in Bear stock?"
01:51:04.083,01:51:07.709,"No. As a matter of fact, when we're done here, I'll probably go out and buy some more."
01:51:09.125,01:51:12.709,"For the opposing view, Mr. Baum."
01:51:15.041,01:51:17.208,I got to stand for this.
01:51:19.875,01:51:20.917,"Okay, hi."
01:51:21.917,01:51:24.542,My firm's thesis is pretty simple.
01:51:24.583,01:51:35.834,"Wall Street took a good idea, Lewis Ranieri's mortgage bond, and turned it into an atomic bomb of fraud and stupidity that's on its way to decimating the world economy."
01:51:35.875,01:51:38.500,How do you really feel?
01:51:38.542,01:51:40.500,MARK: I'm glad you still have a sense of humor.
01:51:40.542,01:51:42.917,I wouldn't if I were you.
01:51:42.959,01:51:49.583,"Now, anyone who knows me knows that I have no problem telling someone they're wrong."
01:51:49.625,01:51:53.792,Bear Stearns is denying rumors of liquidity problems.
01:51:53.834,01:51:56.208,"Holy fuck, it's 39 now!"
01:51:58.291,01:52:00.875,We live in an era of fraud in America.
01:52:00.917,01:52:08.875,"Not just in banking, but in government, education, religion, food, even baseball."
01:52:08.917,01:52:16.250,What bothers me isn't that fraud is not nice or that fraud is mean.
01:52:16.291,01:52:23.083,"It's that for 15,000 years fraud and short-sighted thinking have never, ever worked."
01:52:23.125,01:52:26.083,"PORTER: Jesus, Bear at 37..."
01:52:26.125,01:52:29.417,"Eventually, people get caught, things go south."
01:52:29.458,01:52:30.959,"DANNY: It's fucking plummeting, man."
01:52:31.000,01:52:33.375,When the hell did we forget all that?
01:52:37.500,01:52:40.291,I thought we were better than this.
01:52:40.333,01:52:45.208,And the fact that we're not doesn't make me feel all right and superior.
01:52:45.250,01:52:48.125,It makes me feel... Sad.
01:52:48.166,01:52:50.583,"Every time I fucking hit refresh it's dropping, man."
01:52:52.166,01:53:08.959,"And as fun as it is to watch pompous, dumb Wall Streeters be wildly wrong, and you are wrong, sir, I just know, that at the end of the day average people are going to be the ones that are gonna have to pay for all this."
01:53:09.000,01:53:11.166,"Because they always, always do."
01:53:11.208,01:53:12.166,DANNY: It's 32.
01:53:12.208,01:53:13.125,"VINNIE: It's fucking tanked, man."
01:53:13.166,01:53:15.917,That's my two cents.
01:53:17.166,01:53:18.625,DANNY: Let me drop a deuce at Deutsche.
01:53:18.667,01:53:21.667,WOMAN: Does our bull have a response?
01:53:21.709,01:53:30.125,"Only that, in the entire history of Wall Street, no investment bank has ever failed unless caught in criminal activities."
01:53:30.166,01:53:33.959,"So, yes, I stand by my Bear Stearns optimism."
01:53:34.000,01:53:36.458,"MAN: Mr. Miller, I'm sorry. Quick question."
01:53:36.500,01:53:41.291,"From the time you guys started talking, Bear Stearns stock has fallen more than 38%."
01:53:41.333,01:53:42.542,Would you still buy more?
01:53:42.583,01:53:47.458,"Yeah, sure, of course I'd buy more. Why not?"
01:53:47.500,01:53:48.542,Boom.
01:53:51.750,01:53:53.041,DANNY: Jesus Christ!
01:53:54.667,01:53:58.667,WOMAN: That concludes the first part of our presentation.
01:53:58.709,01:54:05.291,"Up next, we have the legendary former chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan."
01:54:05.333,01:54:06.750,Folks?
01:54:24.750,01:54:29.875,"MALE REPORTER: ...employees of Lehman Brothers today, as the Wall Street giant's stock went to zero."
01:54:29.917,01:54:38.542,The collapse of the venerable New York bank follows a tumultuous few months of market volatility and fear in the world economy.
01:54:38.583,01:54:40.375,I got to see inside.
01:54:41.083,01:54:42.500,How?
01:54:42.959,01:54:43.875,Come on.
01:54:45.417,01:54:48.125,I left my phone in the office.
01:54:48.166,01:54:49.583,Do you mind if I take your pass?
01:54:49.625,01:54:52.291,I don't give a shit anymore.
01:55:00.083,01:55:01.834,Go directly to your transportation.
01:55:01.875,01:55:03.709,Do not talk to the press.
01:55:03.750,01:55:07.250,"After 18 years, I just leave?"
01:55:07.291,01:55:10.250,I'll talk to whoever the hell I want!
01:55:10.291,01:55:12.917,MAN: Do not talk to the press.
01:55:12.959,01:55:14.959,Go directly to your transportation.
01:55:15.000,01:55:16.250,Do not talk to...
01:55:18.667,01:55:19.625,"PORTER: Hey, look, you wanna get a bite tonight?"
01:55:19.667,01:55:24.750,"There's this, uh, new Cuban place just opened on the Lower East Side."
01:55:24.792,01:55:26.917,"-Oh, really?"
01:55:26.959,01:55:28.208,You and I?
01:55:28.250,01:55:29.500,"Yeah, or other people."
01:55:29.542,01:55:31.959,That sounds nice.
01:55:32.000,01:55:33.250,Finally.
01:55:33.667,01:55:35.250,"Mark, hey."
01:55:35.291,01:55:36.375,VINNIE: It's a bloodbath up here.
01:55:36.417,01:55:37.583,Morgan stock has lost half its value.
01:55:37.625,01:55:40.583,It's down to 23.10.
01:55:40.625,01:55:43.792,Clients want to talk to you about pulling their money.
01:55:43.834,01:55:47.417,"It's now or never, Mark."
01:55:50.625,01:55:51.875,Mark.
01:55:53.208,01:55:54.667,"Mark, you hear me?"
01:55:54.709,01:55:56.291,MALE AUTOMATED VOICE: Mailbox one.
01:55:56.333,01:55:59.208,You have 15 messages.
01:56:00.667,01:56:02.125,"WOMAN: Mike, I can't seem to get ahold of you."
01:56:02.166,01:56:06.000,Will you please call me at your earliest convenience.
01:56:06.041,01:56:09.041,It's Jack.
01:56:09.083,01:56:12.250,The market's at an all-time low.
01:56:12.291,01:56:14.959,MIKE: I met my wife on Match.com.
01:56:15.000,01:56:25.208,"My profile said, I am a medical student with only one eye, an awkward social manner, and $145,000 in student loans."
01:56:25.250,01:56:29.500,"She wrote back, You're just what I've been looking for."
01:56:29.542,01:56:31.333,She meant honest.
01:56:31.375,01:56:33.166,So let me be honest.
01:56:33.208,01:56:37.583,The housing crisis represents the greatest financial opportunity of...
01:56:37.625,01:56:40.709,MIKE: Making money is not like I thought it would be.
01:56:40.750,01:56:45.375,This business kills the part of life that is essential.
01:56:45.417,01:56:48.542,The part that has nothing to do with business.
01:56:50.750,01:56:52.709,"For the past two years, my insides..."
01:56:54.083,01:56:56.375,...have felt like they're eating themselves.
01:56:56.417,01:57:03.917,All the people I respected won't talk to me anymore except through lawyers.
01:57:07.458,01:57:13.750,People want an authority to tell them how to value things...
01:57:13.792,01:57:19.291,...but they choose this authority not based on facts or results.
01:57:19.333,01:57:24.083,They choose it because it seems authoritative and familiar.
01:57:24.125,01:57:29.792,And I am not and never have been familiar.
01:57:31.583,01:57:32.500,So...
01:57:33.667,01:57:39.542,"So, I've come to the sullen realization that I must close down the fund."
01:57:39.583,01:57:42.750,"Sincerely, Michael J. Burry, M.D."
01:58:42.417,01:58:44.583,CHARLIE: This isn't how I pictured it.
01:58:46.500,01:58:47.709,JAMIE: What did you think we'd find?
01:58:47.750,01:58:48.875,I don't know.
01:58:50.709,01:58:52.208,Grownups.
01:58:56.125,01:58:57.709,"Mark, you there?"
01:59:00.250,01:59:01.500,VINNIE: Mark?
01:59:01.542,01:59:04.750,Paulson and Bernanke just left the White House.
01:59:10.000,01:59:12.250,There's going to be a bailout.
01:59:13.792,01:59:17.500,"Well, they had to. Right?"
01:59:17.542,01:59:18.750,Paper markets would've collapsed.
01:59:18.792,01:59:20.041,They knew.
01:59:20.083,01:59:21.750,Cash would've stopped coming out of ATMs.
01:59:21.792,01:59:23.583,They had to backstop this.
01:59:23.625,01:59:26.000,They knew the taxpayers would bail them out.
01:59:26.041,01:59:28.583,They weren't being stupid.
01:59:28.625,01:59:30.875,Yeah. 'Cause they're fucking crooks.
01:59:32.709,01:59:36.458,But at least we're going to see some of them go to jail.
01:59:36.500,01:59:40.792,"Right? I mean, they're gonna have to break up the banks."
01:59:40.834,01:59:41.875,"I mean, the party's over."
01:59:41.917,01:59:44.959,I don't know.
01:59:47.625,01:59:54.583,I have a feeling that in a few years people are gonna be doing what they always do when the economy tanks.
01:59:54.625,01:59:58.125,They will be blaming immigrants and poor people.
01:59:58.166,01:59:59.333,JARED: But Mark was wrong.
02:00:00.750,02:00:05.417,"In the years that followed, hundreds of bankers and rating agencies executives went to jail."
02:00:05.458,02:00:07.625,The SEC was completely overhauled.
02:00:07.667,02:00:13.333,And Congress had no choice but to break up the big banks and regulate the mortgage and derivatives industries.
02:00:18.083,02:00:19.542,Just kidding.
02:00:19.583,02:00:26.667,The banks took the money the American people gave them and used it to pay themselves huge bonuses and lobby Congress to kill big reform.
02:00:26.709,02:00:29.000,And then they blamed immigrants and poor people.
02:00:29.041,02:00:31.291,"And this time, even teachers."
02:00:32.583,02:00:36.500,"And when all was said and done, only one single banker went to jail."
02:00:36.542,02:00:37.750,This poor schmuck.
02:00:37.792,02:00:40.542,Kareem Serageldin from Credit Suisse.
02:00:40.583,02:00:47.834,"He hid a few billion in mortgage bond losses, something most of the big banks did on a good day during the crisis."
02:00:47.875,02:00:49.959,"Mark, can we sell now?"
02:00:51.667,02:00:54.208,The fund will make almost $1 billion.
02:00:54.250,02:00:55.959,"You'll clear $200 mil, Mark."
02:00:57.041,02:01:02.000,"You know, once we sell, we'll be just like the rest of them."
02:01:02.041,02:01:03.291,You know that.
02:01:03.333,02:01:05.083,"No, we're not."
02:01:05.125,02:01:10.208,We didn't defraud the American people and prey on their dreams of owning a home.
02:01:10.250,02:01:11.166,They did.
02:01:12.709,02:01:15.083,And now we get to kick them in the teeth.
02:01:20.083,02:01:22.166,A billion dollars.
02:01:23.542,02:01:25.166,That's right.
02:01:25.208,02:01:28.417,But we got to close out our position or it could be zero.
02:01:28.458,02:01:31.375,"I mean, it's now or never, Mark."
02:01:40.458,02:01:41.959,Okay.
02:01:45.667,02:01:47.125,Sell it all.
