00:01:12.739,00:01:16.618,and we'll get you to sit with a banking professional as soon as one becomes available.
00:01:17.202,00:01:18.286,What happens with this?
00:01:18.369,00:01:20.080,"Oh, it's going to light up and vibrate."
00:01:20.163,00:01:22.540,The red lights spin around in a circle. You won't be able to miss it.
00:01:23.458,00:01:24.501,Where do I wait?
00:01:25.168,00:01:26.377,The guest lounge.
00:01:45.855,00:01:47.190,We're ready for you now.
00:01:59.077,00:02:01.788,I'm seeing an overdrawn balance in your daily checking.
00:02:02.497,00:02:06.376,Seems like your direct deposits haven't been received in a few months.
00:02:06.793,00:02:09.337,-From... -Wechsler Steel.
00:02:09.420,00:02:11.214,"Yeah, I've been phoning them for weeks."
00:02:11.297,00:02:12.632,I couldn't get a straight answer.
00:02:13.383,00:02:17.345,"And how about this, uh, foreclosure notice?"
00:02:17.428,00:02:21.266,Ah. The yellow one. So you must be in default.
00:02:21.599,00:02:24.561,My mortgage payment tripled. Overnight.
00:02:27.564,00:02:32.152,"You were on our teaser rate promo, which expired back in January."
00:02:32.235,00:02:34.237,That's why it's called a teaser rate.
00:02:34.487,00:02:37.031,Right? It doesn't last. Make sense?
00:02:37.323,00:02:42.579,"And the new rate is quite a bit higher, so the monthly mortgage payment jumped up."
00:02:42.662,00:02:46.958,"Now, we are required to disclose that possibility at the time of the refi."
00:02:47.375,00:02:49.377,-You did. -I did what?
00:02:49.919,00:02:51.880,You sold me this crap.
00:02:54.591,00:02:55.592,Joe Harding.
00:02:55.675,00:02:57.385,No. I know the name.
00:02:57.635,00:03:00.972,Let me just look at my notes here.
00:03:04.142,00:03:05.643,Terms disclosed.
00:03:07.020,00:03:11.482,I personally disclosed the possibility of a rate hike during your refi.
00:03:12.108,00:03:13.401,Do you remember that?
00:03:14.110,00:03:18.698,You told me that the odds on the rate going past the prime rate...
00:03:19.157,00:03:20.617,were extraordinary.
00:03:20.950,00:03:22.452,But possible.
00:03:22.744,00:03:25.788,But you sold me extraordinary.
00:03:26.039,00:03:29.751,"-But the possible was disclosed. -Listen, Chuck."
00:03:29.834,00:03:33.004,"My granddaughter and my daughter, they live with me."
00:03:33.087,00:03:35.924,"She is a nurse's aide, you know, low pay and all that."
00:03:36.007,00:03:39.844,"She wanted her kid to go to a better school, so they moved in with me."
00:03:39.928,00:03:44.557,"-Lots of people doing that. -Yeah. So you see, I can't lose my house."
00:03:44.807,00:03:46.059,Not to worry.
00:03:46.768,00:03:48.519,You're on the yellow notice.
00:03:52.815,00:03:54.317,Can I talk with someone else?
00:03:54.400,00:03:56.444,-Who? -Someone smarter?
00:04:02.617,00:04:04.244,We've come to make a withdrawal.
00:04:12.543,00:04:20.218,"Aside from the tellers, we invite you to lie down on the floor, face up, and hold your arms and legs in the air like a pussycat."
00:04:30.645,00:04:34.899,"Tellers, please do not be foolish enough to trigger the silent alarm."
00:04:35.066,00:04:37.860,The last people we want here would be the police.
00:04:38.236,00:04:39.529,"That would be messy, no?"
00:04:39.696,00:04:40.697,Put 'em up.
00:04:41.614,00:04:43.825,"Why this? Oh, my God. Why here? What did I do?"
00:04:44.993,00:04:46.828,I follow the book. Just follow procedure.
00:04:46.911,00:04:48.162,Just stay calm. Stay calm.
00:04:49.998,00:04:51.207,You're going to get yourself shot!
00:04:51.666,00:04:54.419,"Gentlemen, it's best to remain silent."
00:04:54.752,00:04:55.920,I'm cramping.
00:04:56.004,00:04:57.880,"Relax, please. You can sit up."
00:04:58.172,00:05:00.633,"-Ah. -Hey, no! Not you! Pussycat!"
00:05:04.012,00:05:05.013,You can have this.
00:05:11.185,00:05:15.815,I'm sorry you're a casualty of a corrupt system that no longer serves the people.
00:05:15.982,00:05:18.234,Yeah. I've been banking here for 40 years.
00:05:18.443,00:05:20.403,You're just an account number.
00:05:21.404,00:05:23.072,"It's not much, but it's all yours."
00:05:23.531,00:05:25.283,"No, my friend. Not from you."
00:05:27.827,00:05:31.414,It is a culture's duty to take care of its elderly.
00:05:32.081,00:05:33.791,Chuck here couldn't give a crap.
00:05:34.625,00:05:35.626,Chuck.
00:05:36.794,00:05:38.713,-Are you Chuck? -Yes.
00:05:39.047,00:05:40.757,I'm Chuck. I'm Chuck.
00:05:41.340,00:05:43.551,Are you the one taking this man's house?
00:05:43.676,00:05:45.344,"-I'm not, personally. -Give me your wallet."
00:05:45.511,00:05:47.138,"Okay. Look, I got... I have..."
00:05:47.305,00:05:50.099,"I have plenty of stuff here, okay? Cash."
00:05:50.224,00:05:52.560,There's a gym membership. Take it. I never go.
00:05:53.519,00:05:54.854,Fifteen seconds.
00:05:54.937,00:05:56.898,-Pussycat! -Meow.
00:05:57.023,00:05:58.399,Shut up!
00:06:03.905,00:06:06.824,"I'm happy to say, our time together has ended."
00:06:06.908,00:06:09.827,Please do not call the police for 90 seconds.
00:06:09.994,00:06:12.538,A shoot-out never has a happy ending.
00:06:17.877,00:06:21.005,Oh. They make a pill for that.
00:06:40.691,00:06:43.486,That looks like a gang tattoo to me.
00:06:44.195,00:06:45.863,Very detailed.
00:06:46.197,00:06:48.116,I imagine the artist did them all.
00:06:48.199,00:06:54.747,"So, if you find the tattoo parlor, then you'll find the artist, and you've got yourself a bank robber."
00:06:54.997,00:06:56.666,Sounds pretty standard to me.
00:06:56.874,00:06:59.502,"Right. Well, thanks a lot, old-timer."
00:06:59.585,00:07:02.046,"You know, we're going to get you an application."
00:07:02.130,00:07:09.262,"Hey, listen. I've watched this TV show called Law and Order, and they solve crimes much quicker than you do."
00:07:09.345,00:07:10.596,You should tune in.
00:07:12.348,00:07:18.438,"Well, you know, in the real world, solving crimes takes a little longer than a one-hour television show."
00:07:18.604,00:07:21.858,"Well, I guess this wraps it up for us, Mr. Harding."
00:07:21.983,00:07:25.528,"If we need any additional information, then we'll get in contact with you."
00:07:25.736,00:07:27.655,Oh. You'll need my address and phone number.
00:07:27.738,00:07:28.990,"Uh, not necessary."
00:07:30.491,00:07:33.161,We'll find you. That's what we do.
00:07:37.665,00:07:39.375,It was hard to tell. They had masks on.
00:07:39.584,00:07:42.253,"I got close to one. It was a male, about six feet."
00:07:42.462,00:07:46.883,And he had this tattoo wrapped around his neck that I told you about.
00:07:47.049,00:07:49.260,"You know, you find the tattoo artist..."
00:07:49.427,00:07:51.220,-You find the criminal. -Exactly.
00:07:51.304,00:07:52.305,That's what I told them.
00:07:52.388,00:07:54.599,Okay. I'm sure you're not supposed to be talking about all of this.
00:07:55.683,00:07:58.644,It must have been so cool being in the middle of a heist.
00:07:58.811,00:08:00.646,"Crime is not cool, babe."
00:08:03.900,00:08:04.901,Or worse.
00:08:05.276,00:08:07.111,What's worse than being shot?
00:08:07.195,00:08:08.863,Being shot twice.
00:08:12.158,00:08:15.161,is traditionally indicative of gang affiliation.
00:08:15.411,00:08:18.915,We believe these individuals used the same tattoo artist.
00:08:18.998,00:08:21.667,"If we can find this artist, then we can find our perp."
00:08:21.918,00:08:23.628,It's pretty standard stuff really.
00:08:26.714,00:08:27.882,What an asshole.
00:08:28.132,00:08:29.467,Language.
00:08:37.099,00:08:38.559,Bingo!
00:08:38.726,00:08:43.523,The three men walked off with approximately 1.6 million dollars.
00:08:43.773,00:08:49.278,The FBI and the NYPD are reporting no leads at this time.
00:08:49.779,00:08:53.699,So what? Nobody gets hurt except the insurance company. And they'll be fine.
00:08:53.783,00:08:55.701,"They were as cool as cucumbers, gents."
00:08:56.077,00:08:58.704,They choreographed it down to the second.
00:08:58.996,00:09:00.414,Like a dance.
00:09:00.498,00:09:03.167,"Yeah, a conga line right into prison."
00:09:03.793,00:09:04.961,Are we going to play or what?
00:09:05.670,00:09:07.046,Ask the man in charge.
00:09:08.256,00:09:09.131,Milton?
00:09:09.757,00:09:11.092,Milton!
00:09:11.968,00:09:13.886,Who're we rolling with on two?
00:09:14.178,00:09:16.180,"Oh! Oh, yeah."
00:09:19.809,00:09:22.061,G-52.
00:09:23.604,00:09:26.107,"If I ever get that bad, shoot me."
00:09:27.984,00:09:28.901,Oh.
00:09:30.945,00:09:32.029,Did you get one of these?
00:09:32.738,00:09:34.156,It came certified mail.
00:09:34.490,00:09:35.533,"Yes, sir."
00:09:35.825,00:09:38.160,You ever get good news that needed a signature?
00:09:38.244,00:09:39.912,You contact anybody down at the plant?
00:09:40.121,00:09:42.415,"Oh, not yet. But we'll find out what's going on."
00:09:43.833,00:09:45.084,I need my pension money.
00:09:45.334,00:09:47.044,"Oh. Yeah, tell me about it."
00:09:51.382,00:09:53.884,G-52.
00:09:55.011,00:09:56.887,Let's go and help the elderly.
00:10:03.728,00:10:08.608,Semtech had no intentions of shuttering U.S. operations.
00:10:09.859,00:10:24.624,"However, with the demand for specialty parts way down, and the cost of operations in this country rising steadily, they have made the decision to move all manufacturing to Vietnam."
00:10:28.628,00:10:34.175,Wechsler's stateside operations will be phased out over the next 30 days.
00:10:40.598,00:10:43.434,I can only address you in an orderly fashion.
00:10:45.686,00:10:47.480,"Excuse me, Mr. Lewis."
00:10:49.273,00:10:51.317,What is this about?
00:10:54.487,00:11:00.868,Semtech Steel has frozen all pension payments during this transitional period.
00:11:02.244,00:11:03.913,What does that mean? Frozen?
00:11:05.581,00:11:15.841,"Wechsler maintained a fund to honor all pre-merger pension plans, which was eventually to be married with the new pension fund under the new labor contract."
00:11:15.966,00:11:18.094,"For God's sake, can you say that in English?"
00:11:21.097,00:11:25.309,"No U.S. operations, no fiscal responsibility for Semtech."
00:11:25.810,00:11:28.270,The pension fund is being dissolved.
00:11:35.778,00:11:43.536,"With all due respect, Donald, thirty years of hard work means shit to you people!"
00:11:53.462,00:11:56.132,Shit. We'd be dead by the time the settlement comes in.
00:11:56.215,00:11:57.925,Which would suit them just fine.
00:11:58.426,00:12:00.177,When did coffee go to two dollars?
00:12:00.386,00:12:01.637,A decade ago.
00:12:01.804,00:12:04.557,"God forbid you get extra foam on the top, you have to make payments."
00:12:05.182,00:12:06.725,Let's leave her 20 percent.
00:12:06.934,00:12:09.770,"Okay, good. Now she can take a cruise."
00:12:10.187,00:12:12.523,"Okay, boys. I got a half a rhubarb left."
00:12:12.606,00:12:15.401,"We got the blueberry crumble, which is a little stale."
00:12:15.484,00:12:18.112,"And I got the mud pie. So, what's it gonna be?"
00:12:18.487,00:12:20.322,"Uh, not today. Thank you."
00:12:21.198,00:12:22.074,No pie?
00:12:22.158,00:12:23.659,We're watching our waistlines.
00:12:24.034,00:12:25.995,Plus we're shit broke.
00:12:26.245,00:12:28.581,"Okay. Well, don't tie up my table all day."
00:12:28.664,00:12:29.957,I gotta make a living here.
00:12:31.750,00:12:35.546,Did I tell you those guys in the bank had machine guns?
00:12:35.838,00:12:37.631,You told us six times already!
00:12:37.965,00:12:40.217,"Yeah, well, it keeps going in my head."
00:12:40.551,00:12:42.428,"Over and over, you know?"
00:12:42.511,00:12:44.054,Maybe you're having a stroke.
00:12:45.639,00:12:48.058,"Here you go, boys. Always have your pie."
00:12:48.392,00:12:49.894,Life is short.
00:12:50.102,00:12:51.812,"Well, thanks for the reminder."
00:12:53.397,00:12:54.356,"She's right, you know."
00:12:54.440,00:12:57.234,We should be having our pie and eating it.
00:12:57.693,00:12:59.445,"We've earned that much, at least."
00:13:06.410,00:13:09.997,Welcome to what is essentially the last rose ceremony.
00:13:11.624,00:13:14.043,"Kaitlyn, this is the final rose tonight."
00:13:14.418,00:13:17.254,"She can count, Einstein!"
00:13:19.757,00:13:23.636,This week was... incredible.
00:13:23.719,00:13:25.971,"Shawn's boring, and Nick's a man-whore."
00:13:26.889,00:13:29.308,Monogamy is an outdated concept.
00:13:29.391,00:13:33.020,I am in love and that's so exciting.
00:13:33.812,00:13:37.024,Ben. The only choice she's got.
00:13:37.233,00:13:39.443,She's not going to move to a farm in those heels.
00:13:39.527,00:13:41.862,She's kissed them all. With her tongue.
00:13:41.946,00:13:45.199,Done the whole cast that way. She's a walking venereal disease!
00:13:47.701,00:13:51.038,"has made my decision feel, like, almost impossible."
00:13:51.121,00:13:52.915,"Kaitlyn, close your mouth."
00:14:01.215,00:14:02.091,Nick.
00:14:02.174,00:14:04.260,"-Oh, shit! -God!"
00:14:04.343,00:14:06.845,Turn it off. It's a travesty.
00:14:07.721,00:14:08.931,They never learn.
00:14:12.768,00:14:13.978,"Tomorrow, gents."
00:14:14.728,00:14:16.689,That was a great meal tonight.
00:14:16.855,00:14:20.109,What you can do with frozen fish is admirable.
00:14:21.944,00:14:24.780,"And that combination of paprika and garlic, oh!"
00:14:25.823,00:14:27.116,-Fantastic! -Oh. Whoo!
00:14:27.199,00:14:29.159,"Actually, I think it was the mold."
00:14:32.830,00:14:33.706,Joe.
00:14:35.291,00:14:36.166,What?
00:14:37.209,00:14:38.419,We'll be all right?
00:14:38.836,00:14:42.131,"Sure, we will. It always works out in the end."
00:14:43.299,00:14:44.550,And then you die.
00:14:47.052,00:14:48.846,"Good night, all. I'll see you tomorrow."
00:15:27.801,00:15:29.178,Assholes.
00:15:46.654,00:15:48.739,"Hey, Willie. How you feeling?"
00:15:49.114,00:15:51.951,"Partly cloudy, Doc. Partly cloudy."
00:15:52.326,00:15:54.411,"Well, I'm not going to lie to you."
00:15:54.662,00:15:56.246,You can. I won't mind.
00:15:56.580,00:15:58.582,The dialysis is working marginally.
00:15:58.666,00:16:00.918,"You know, a kidney is all that's going to get you well."
00:16:02.002,00:16:04.296,"Well, I'll look on eBay."
00:16:04.380,00:16:09.426,"You're way down the list. It's partially your age, it's partially your insurance. It's partially..."
00:16:09.510,00:16:11.804,Kidneys aren't that easy to come by.
00:16:11.887,00:16:15.265,Yeah. Everybody wants to hold on to theirs.
00:16:15.557,00:16:18.143,Have you talked to your daughter? Your friends?
00:16:18.227,00:16:20.354,It's common to find a donor in your circles.
00:16:21.063,00:16:23.065,And that's often the best match anyway.
00:16:24.817,00:16:25.818,I'll talk to them.
00:16:26.652,00:16:28.153,Sooner than later.
00:16:30.239,00:16:31.824,"So, what are we talking about?"
00:16:34.284,00:16:36.662,We're talking about much sooner than later.
00:16:43.752,00:16:44.795,You send something?
00:16:45.879,00:16:50.300,"Wait a minute, the postman brought me this box right here, but that can't be it."
00:16:50.467,00:16:52.469,"That's it, that's it! Open it already!"
00:16:52.636,00:16:55.347,"All right, all right. Hold your horses. I'm old."
00:16:58.142,00:17:00.144,"Oh, my goodness."
00:17:00.602,00:17:01.687,This...
00:17:02.146,00:17:05.899,This is the ugliest shirt I've ever seen.
00:17:06.108,00:17:06.984,Boppa.
00:17:09.778,00:17:12.740,All right. Let's see what else is down in here.
00:17:17.036,00:17:18.829,"You're getting real big, K."
00:17:21.874,00:17:25.544,"Hey, you tell your mom..."
00:17:25.878,00:17:28.964,that her career isn't as important as seeing her family.
00:17:30.549,00:17:31.592,I will.
00:17:31.842,00:17:33.510,-Promise? -I promise.
00:17:33.844,00:17:35.179,Good girl.
00:17:36.847,00:17:38.348,-That's my ride. -Okay.
00:18:11.173,00:18:13.133,"Oh, Jesus Christ."
00:18:16.762,00:18:17.638,Ezra!
00:18:18.680,00:18:19.598,Ezra!
00:18:20.766,00:18:23.477,You gotta stop this. I can't listen anymore.
00:18:23.560,00:18:24.603,I've been practicing!
00:18:24.686,00:18:26.688,"Yeah, but it doesn't matter 'cause you get worse every week."
00:18:26.772,00:18:28.982,It's kind of a miracle. I don't know how you do it.
00:18:29.066,00:18:32.611,"So what's the point? You're no good, you don't like it, you're not gonna be a professional."
00:18:32.694,00:18:34.988,"You wanna end up like me, working in a factory?"
00:18:35.072,00:18:38.033,And every two months you're getting a gig for 40 bucks at some dive?
00:18:38.117,00:18:39.034,You don't want that.
00:18:39.118,00:18:40.410,I don't even like this thing.
00:18:40.494,00:18:42.162,"No! And it doesn't like you, either."
00:18:42.246,00:18:45.541,"Trust me, I'm doing you a favor. You'll thank me for this."
00:18:46.083,00:18:47.126,"Thank you, sir."
00:18:47.292,00:18:48.460,"Oh, you're very welcome."
00:18:49.086,00:18:51.922,"I want to be a dancer, like Beyoncé."
00:18:52.381,00:18:54.675,"Well, it's none of my business."
00:18:54.758,00:18:56.927,"Okay. All right, good."
00:18:57.136,00:18:59.513,"All right, get off. Get off me."
00:18:59.972,00:19:02.891,Get off. I'll go find your grandma.
00:19:02.975,00:19:05.102,She's still got to pay me for the session.
00:19:08.397,00:19:10.607,You gotta think of it like putting down a horse.
00:19:10.691,00:19:13.819,"Sometimes, it's the kindest, most ethical thing you can do."
00:19:14.236,00:19:17.406,"Well, thank you for being so honest with me."
00:19:17.698,00:19:19.908,I really appreciate your candor.
00:19:20.117,00:19:23.245,"Well, your grandson hasn't got a musical bone in his body."
00:19:23.328,00:19:27.124,I know. It was so painful listening in the other room.
00:19:27.291,00:19:29.501,And I had to sit across from him.
00:19:30.210,00:19:31.253,Okay.
00:19:31.336,00:19:32.629,-Al. -Yeah?
00:19:32.713,00:19:36.008,"I never told you this, but I've seen you perform a few times."
00:19:36.592,00:19:41.430,"-Ah... -In the West Village with Stan Getz, 1977."
00:19:41.513,00:19:43.182,It was stunning.
00:19:43.390,00:19:44.600,You saw me play with Getz?
00:19:44.683,00:19:45.559,Sure did.
00:19:45.642,00:19:46.852,"What are you, following me?"
00:19:46.935,00:19:50.230,No. I was following the music.
00:19:52.274,00:19:54.985,"Um, hey. I'll see you at the store, okay?"
00:19:55.068,00:19:56.320,See you at the store.
00:19:56.445,00:19:57.321,Yup.
00:19:57.404,00:19:58.906,All right.
00:20:04.077,00:20:05.245,"Bye, guys."
00:20:10.417,00:20:14.880,"You know, at some point, I'm gonna have to start walking home on my own."
00:20:15.088,00:20:16.298,I'm 14.
00:20:16.548,00:20:18.258,"Not on my watch, lovie."
00:20:18.550,00:20:21.220,This neighborhood is not the same as it was 40 years ago.
00:20:21.678,00:20:25.098,Right. It's safer and more gentrified.
00:20:26.516,00:20:27.517,Bam.
00:20:27.809,00:20:29.102,And what is this?
00:20:29.394,00:20:31.230,It's my biology test.
00:20:31.813,00:20:33.690,"Another day, another A."
00:20:34.524,00:20:36.485,"Well done, kiddo."
00:20:36.777,00:20:37.945,I'm almost there.
00:20:38.070,00:20:38.946,Almost where?
00:20:39.363,00:20:44.409,"You said, and I quote, You get straight A's, you get a puppy."
00:20:45.160,00:20:46.870,I like your confidence.
00:20:47.162,00:20:49.081,"Must have got that from you, young man."
00:20:49.373,00:20:52.751,"Not bad, kiddo. Not bad at all."
00:21:07.683,00:21:09.893,"Happy Birthday, young man."
00:21:11.186,00:21:14.189,Didn't expect you broke bastards to get me anything.
00:21:14.314,00:21:16.441,Temper your enthusiasm. It's not much.
00:21:19.403,00:21:20.737,That's just what I needed.
00:21:21.029,00:21:21.989,-Yup. -Mmm-hmm.
00:21:22.072,00:21:23.865,-One can't get enough time. -Oh.
00:21:23.949,00:21:25.367,Take a look at that cute picture.
00:21:25.450,00:21:28.578,"Oh, yeah. My little K."
00:21:28.829,00:21:31.206,"When you die, you can will it to her as a memento."
00:21:32.582,00:21:37.004,I'm sure she'll want a picture of herself on a watch from her dead grandpa.
00:21:38.630,00:21:41.508,Look at that. That's really something.
00:21:41.633,00:21:42.718,"You bet, kid."
00:21:44.553,00:21:46.638,This corn is from World War Two.
00:21:47.514,00:21:48.598,Corn?
00:21:49.433,00:21:50.809,I thought this was...
00:21:52.769,00:21:54.938,I don't know what I thought it was.
00:22:12.914,00:22:15.167,I think I may rob a bank.
00:22:17.169,00:22:18.211,What was that?
00:22:19.838,00:22:23.258,I'm thinking of robbing a bank.
00:22:23.550,00:22:24.468,Oh.
00:22:24.843,00:22:26.678,I'm thinking about buying a Ferrari.
00:22:26.845,00:22:30.599,"Hmm. I just got drafted by the Knicks. Good week for everybody, huh?"
00:22:30.682,00:22:32.350,Good week.
00:22:34.603,00:22:36.146,They're taking my house.
00:22:37.731,00:22:39.191,They're taking my house.
00:22:39.483,00:22:40.650,I've got 30 days.
00:22:40.984,00:22:42.152,Who's taking your house?
00:22:42.611,00:22:43.528,The bank.
00:22:43.612,00:22:45.280,They're taking your house and you didn't tell us?
00:22:45.363,00:22:47.032,What are you gonna do? Lend me money?
00:22:47.115,00:22:50.077,We're all broke. The three of us combined.
00:22:50.410,00:22:54.581,These banks practically destroyed this country.
00:22:54.998,00:22:58.001,They crushed a lot of people's dreams.
00:22:58.085,00:23:01.171,And nothing ever happened to them.
00:23:01.755,00:23:08.678,"We're three old guys. We hit a bank, we get away with it, we retire with dignity."
00:23:08.804,00:23:16.603,"Worst comes to the worst, we get caught, we get a bed, three meals a day and better healthcare than we get now."
00:23:17.354,00:23:18.396,You...
00:23:19.106,00:23:21.108,You're talking about us?
00:23:22.025,00:23:23.110,Us and you?
00:23:23.193,00:23:26.571,"Yeah, I mean, if a gang of thugs can do it, it can't be that hard."
00:23:26.655,00:23:27.948,You're out of your frigging mind.
00:23:28.031,00:23:32.619,"You have spent 20 years waiting to die, Al."
00:23:32.911,00:23:35.288,With no life and no purpose.
00:23:35.497,00:23:37.541,And robbing a bank is going to give me a purpose?
00:23:37.624,00:23:39.209,It will give us money.
00:23:39.376,00:23:42.420,Willie would be able to get on a plane and go and see his granddaughter.
00:23:42.587,00:23:45.132,"It's a little hard to catch a plane out of prison, Joe."
00:23:45.215,00:23:47.259,"Yeah, but we won't get caught."
00:23:47.342,00:23:48.718,They didn't get caught.
00:23:48.885,00:23:51.513,"Well, they were young. They were fast."
00:23:51.596,00:23:54.474,"We got skills, experience. Smarts."
00:23:54.558,00:23:57.102,"Arthritis, gout, shingles."
00:24:19.040,00:24:20.250,"Make a wish, Willie."
00:24:53.283,00:24:54.159,Hello?
00:24:54.367,00:25:00.457,"I'm just lying here, thinking about all of the birthday wishes that I have had over the years."
00:25:01.583,00:25:03.376,And how many of them I've kept secret.
00:25:03.668,00:25:05.962,And none of them ever came true.
00:25:06.922,00:25:08.506,They never seem to pay out.
00:25:09.007,00:25:11.593,"So I figure I'm going to tell you this one, Joe."
00:25:11.718,00:25:14.137,"I mean, what's the worst that can happen?"
00:25:14.221,00:25:15.472,"A whole bunch of nothing, right?"
00:25:15.805,00:25:17.349,"Fire away, Willie."
00:25:20.352,00:25:23.647,I want to live better than I am.
00:25:23.939,00:25:28.235,I want to see my family more than once a year.
00:25:28.568,00:25:35.033,"And from here on in, I want to have a piece of pie whenever the hell I want a piece of pie."
00:25:35.116,00:25:36.201,You know what I mean?
00:25:41.748,00:25:43.625,You were serious today.
00:25:46.503,00:25:50.048,"The thing is, we have nothing to lose."
00:25:52.926,00:25:54.344,"I'm not a thief, Joe."
00:25:54.636,00:25:56.137,Neither am I.
00:25:57.973,00:26:00.558,"We take exactly what's owed on the pension, right?"
00:26:00.850,00:26:02.018,That's all I want.
00:26:03.395,00:26:04.479,My word.
00:26:05.772,00:26:06.898,Wake Al up.
00:26:07.565,00:26:08.733,Hold on.
00:26:09.276,00:26:10.402,Al.
00:26:11.736,00:26:13.113,Al.
00:26:14.406,00:26:15.282,Albert!
00:26:15.365,00:26:16.825,-Huh? -Pick up the phone!
00:26:17.033,00:26:17.993,Who died?
00:26:18.076,00:26:19.536,"Nobody died, it's Joe."
00:26:19.786,00:26:21.204,I don't talk to criminals.
00:26:23.039,00:26:23.999,You heard that?
00:26:24.082,00:26:25.959,Hang up. I'll call him back.
00:26:31.589,00:26:32.674,What do you want?
00:26:33.008,00:26:35.844,"The thing is, what do you want, Al?"
00:26:36.136,00:26:40.390,"You want to drift off into the sunset, or do you want to go out with a bang?"
00:26:40.640,00:26:41.975,I don't have a problem with dying.
00:26:42.058,00:26:43.476,I just don't want to do it in prison.
00:26:43.727,00:26:45.145,Nobody's going to prison.
00:26:45.228,00:26:46.980,What exactly is happening here?
00:26:47.188,00:26:48.273,Willie's in.
00:26:48.565,00:26:49.816,You're both out of your minds.
00:26:50.108,00:26:51.109,"Sleep on it, Al."
00:26:51.192,00:26:53.611,I don't need to sleep on anything. I'm not a bank robber.
00:26:53.695,00:26:55.822,"Neither are you, or you, Willie."
00:27:00.327,00:27:01.202,What?
00:27:01.328,00:27:02.662,Why did you pick up the phone?
00:27:02.746,00:27:03.913,Because it was ringing.
00:27:04.122,00:27:05.665,Because you're interested.
00:27:05.749,00:27:07.292,"What are you, my psychiatrist now?"
00:27:07.375,00:27:08.543,More like a psychic.
00:27:08.626,00:27:10.754,"Well, then you know I'm going to hang up now."
00:27:10.837,00:27:12.088,"I'll see you tomorrow, Al."
00:27:12.505,00:27:13.506,Sweet dreams.
00:27:13.590,00:27:15.216,And don't call back.
00:27:46.247,00:27:49.626,"These goddamn expiration dates are so small, they want you to go blind."
00:27:49.709,00:27:52.295,"Take these, I got two for one."
00:27:52.587,00:27:55.673,"Oh, good. Chicken thighs are on special. I can make a cordon bleu."
00:27:55.840,00:27:56.800,Mets or Yankees?
00:27:57.050,00:27:58.635,Don't insult me.
00:28:02.389,00:28:03.807,Huh. Nice hats.
00:28:04.432,00:28:06.101,"We got business here, Al."
00:28:06.393,00:28:08.269,Okay. What do you mean?
00:28:08.645,00:28:09.646,Give me that list.
00:28:09.938,00:28:11.147,What are you doing?
00:28:11.439,00:28:13.066,Wait here. We'll be right back.
00:28:13.149,00:28:14.818,What are you doing with my list?
00:28:15.235,00:28:16.778,Why did you rip up my list?
00:28:16.945,00:28:18.488,Why should I wait in the car?
00:28:19.531,00:28:20.949,Wait in the bloody car!
00:28:21.241,00:28:22.534,Why?
00:28:24.411,00:28:26.538,"I don't want to stay in the car, it's hot in here!"
00:28:53.398,00:28:54.983,"Joe, I'm going to get a roast."
00:28:55.275,00:28:57.652,We need chicken. It's cordon bleu.
00:28:57.944,00:28:59.279,I don't want cordon bleu.
00:28:59.446,00:29:00.697,Stick to the plan!
00:29:04.951,00:29:06.870,"Ah, welcome to Value..."
00:29:07.162,00:29:08.246,"Hello, Al."
00:29:08.329,00:29:09.414,"Hi, Annie."
00:29:09.497,00:29:10.582,What are you shopping for?
00:29:10.874,00:29:16.463,"Chicken cordon bleu was the plan, but the plan seems to be changing."
00:29:19.966,00:29:21.426,I gotta get some chicken thighs.
00:29:21.551,00:29:23.428,"Oh, let me help you."
00:29:47.243,00:29:48.536,Give me the big one.
00:29:49.662,00:29:50.538,The whole thing?
00:29:50.997,00:29:52.499,The whole damn thing.
00:29:54.083,00:29:55.460,You're the boss.
00:29:59.047,00:30:01.674,"Annie, just let me have the thing."
00:30:01.966,00:30:03.676,"Come on, you have your own work to do now."
00:30:03.885,00:30:06.971,"No, no. It's my job. There's no problem."
00:30:07.430,00:30:10.183,Let's see. There's a double coupon in the flyer.
00:30:10.391,00:30:14.395,"It costs about the same as thighs but, see, these are breasts."
00:30:14.604,00:30:17.732,"And breasts are better than thighs, don't you think?"
00:30:18.650,00:30:19.859,It could go either way.
00:30:26.616,00:30:27.784,So good.
00:30:28.618,00:30:30.328,Do you like ham?
00:30:43.007,00:30:44.175,Okay.
00:30:44.717,00:30:47.554,This will go perfectly with...
00:30:47.637,00:30:50.223,"I mean, if you want company. It's a big bottle."
00:30:50.390,00:30:52.058,"Yeah, listen, I got to tell you."
00:30:52.141,00:30:54.519,"You're a terrific person, but I know what you're doing."
00:30:54.602,00:30:57.981,You're wasting your time. I don't want to have a relationship with anybody.
00:30:58.147,00:30:59.274,I wasn't offering one.
00:30:59.357,00:31:01.359,"Good, great. Then we see eye to eye."
00:31:05.613,00:31:07.365,We'll talk about this later.
00:31:07.615,00:31:09.284,I'll look forward to it.
00:31:53.620,00:31:56.205,Where the fuck is my basket?
00:32:01.669,00:32:02.670,"Willie, Willie."
00:32:03.421,00:32:04.297,Al's gone.
00:32:04.589,00:32:05.840,I got a new getaway car.
00:32:06.215,00:32:07.550,Where the hell did you get that thing?
00:32:08.009,00:32:09.886,I stole it. Jump in the basket.
00:32:10.219,00:32:11.804,Who the hell do you think I am? E.T.?
00:32:12.055,00:32:13.473,"Willie, jump in the bloody basket."
00:32:13.556,00:32:14.974,I'm not getting in no bloody basket!
00:32:23.066,00:32:24.192,She's gaining on us.
00:32:27.445,00:32:28.821,"Hey, you. Stop right there!"
00:32:30.114,00:32:31.199,Hey! Halt!
00:32:31.574,00:32:33.368,-Halt! -What are you chasing me for?
00:32:33.743,00:32:34.619,Halt!
00:32:34.869,00:32:36.204,I heard you the first time.
00:32:36.371,00:32:37.664,Don't make me tase you!
00:32:38.539,00:32:41.626,This is not an admission of guilt! I am just tired.
00:32:41.751,00:32:43.211,We got to get rid of some weight.
00:32:43.544,00:32:45.171,Get rid of that damned pork loin.
00:32:45.338,00:32:46.214,What?
00:32:47.966,00:32:48.925,What the...
00:32:49.467,00:32:51.177,"Flour, flour. Give me the flour."
00:32:53.262,00:32:54.138,Halt!
00:32:57.600,00:32:58.476,Stop!
00:33:05.358,00:33:06.859,I think we can make the light.
00:33:07.902,00:33:09.445,"No, no, no. You're not going to make the light, Joe."
00:33:09.529,00:33:10.780,You're not gonna make the light.
00:33:12.407,00:33:13.700,"No, Joe, you can't make the light!"
00:33:23.876,00:33:25.378,Don't make another move.
00:33:33.261,00:33:36.222,I don't know what's going on in the world anymore.
00:33:37.932,00:33:41.352,You were going to make a cordon bleu with chicken thighs?
00:33:41.686,00:33:43.354,That's a crime in and of itself.
00:33:43.688,00:33:46.024,I have nothing to say for myself.
00:33:47.358,00:33:48.943,Look what you did to Cindy.
00:33:49.986,00:33:53.114,Now she looking like a Colombian drug mule.
00:34:00.371,00:34:01.831,Never...
00:34:01.998,00:34:06.753,in all my years has anybody ever walked off with a whole pork loin.
00:34:07.670,00:34:08.671,What would your momma say?
00:34:09.380,00:34:10.923,Go big or go home.
00:34:12.759,00:34:14.427,Had to be the brother.
00:34:22.935,00:34:24.771,And why were you running? You didn't steal anything.
00:34:24.854,00:34:26.731,Because your storm trooper here was chasing me.
00:34:26.814,00:34:28.232,"No, they were chasing your friends."
00:34:28.316,00:34:30.568,"He was chasing me. When somebody chases me, I run."
00:34:30.651,00:34:31.527,That's the way it works.
00:34:32.236,00:34:35.114,"Look, you guys are old."
00:34:35.406,00:34:38.826,"And I'm gonna be there in 40, or 50 years, I get it."
00:34:39.702,00:34:40.953,Here.
00:34:41.871,00:34:43.081,Here are some coupons.
00:34:44.290,00:34:47.376,"And we double them on Tuesday, but I'm sure you already know that."
00:34:48.377,00:34:50.963,So don't steal. It's wrong.
00:34:51.255,00:34:54.884,"But if you do steal, don't steal from Value Town."
00:34:57.887,00:34:59.680,"Yeah, couple of great friends I got."
00:34:59.806,00:35:01.808,You just made me an accomplice to a robbery.
00:35:01.891,00:35:03.643,We never asked you to do anything.
00:35:03.893,00:35:06.938,I drive you there. I drive you back. That makes me a getaway driver.
00:35:07.021,00:35:07.980,"Oh, don't flatter yourself."
00:35:08.064,00:35:10.566,"You drive like my grandmother, and she drove a horse and buggy."
00:35:10.650,00:35:14.487,That's a good one. Just for that you can walk home.
00:35:14.654,00:35:16.864,Don't touch my car. Don't get in the car.
00:35:17.240,00:35:18.866,You're not going to make us walk!
00:35:18.950,00:35:19.951,Hell I'm not.
00:35:20.034,00:35:23.037,"Oh, boy. You guys are going to be great bank robbers."
00:35:23.121,00:35:25.998,You just got busted robbing Value Town!
00:35:26.082,00:35:27.083,Oh-ho!
00:35:35.967,00:35:38.594,I hate when he's right.
00:35:38.928,00:35:40.555,We're going to need professional help.
00:35:41.055,00:35:42.014,You think?
00:35:42.098,00:35:46.352,"Oh, yeah. We might as well turn ourselves in now."
00:35:46.561,00:35:49.105,You know any criminals?
00:35:49.772,00:35:51.190,I know a lowlife.
00:36:14.172,00:36:16.215,"I know it's you, Murphy."
00:36:19.051,00:36:22.013,I've come about the child support you're not paying.
00:36:22.096,00:36:24.265,"Didn't I lose you in the divorce, Joe?"
00:36:24.390,00:36:25.349,Hit the buzzer.
00:36:34.942,00:36:36.694,Blueberry Kush.
00:36:37.236,00:36:38.571,OG Kush.
00:36:43.367,00:36:45.912,Marijuana has superior medical benefits.
00:36:46.078,00:36:48.164,It's good for all kinds of situations.
00:36:48.331,00:36:52.835,"Anxiety, pain, seizures, stress."
00:36:53.127,00:36:57.632,"Anxiety, pain, seizures, stress."
00:36:57.840,00:37:00.468,"Anxiety, pain, seizures..."
00:37:00.551,00:37:02.178,What is your situation?
00:37:02.428,00:37:04.096,"Right now, anxiety."
00:37:04.430,00:37:08.434,"Listen, Joe, not to be uncool to family and such."
00:37:08.517,00:37:09.477,Ex-family.
00:37:09.685,00:37:12.980,"As you say. But, what do you want from me, man?"
00:37:13.147,00:37:15.441,"We have this project, and we're looking for help."
00:37:16.025,00:37:17.318,What kind of project?
00:37:17.401,00:37:19.278,"Oh, well, we'd rather not say."
00:37:19.528,00:37:21.822,"Well, that makes it harder for me to help you."
00:37:22.031,00:37:25.910,We need to find the type of people who do bad things.
00:37:26.369,00:37:29.622,What makes you think that I would know people like that?
00:37:29.705,00:37:31.999,I figured your kind move in the same circles.
00:37:32.166,00:37:33.960,My kind? Entrepreneurs?
00:37:34.126,00:37:37.171,No. Lowlifes. Deadbeats. Gangster types.
00:37:37.380,00:37:40.967,"See, I'm sure that you could point us in the right direction."
00:37:47.682,00:37:48.641,What's wrong with him?
00:37:48.933,00:37:49.976,He's thinking.
00:37:53.729,00:37:56.607,"I know it looks it, but I've seen him do it before."
00:37:57.900,00:37:59.068,"It's the drugs, you know?"
00:37:59.151,00:38:00.528,"-Oh, yeah. Of course. -Yeah."
00:38:12.123,00:38:13.916,"Oh, this stupid bitch."
00:38:14.583,00:38:17.003,I wish I could tase his old ass.
00:38:17.420,00:38:19.839,Here comes an eggplant. Eggplant.
00:38:20.298,00:38:21.257,"Hey, you."
00:38:21.340,00:38:22.341,"-Hi, Annie. -Hi!"
00:38:22.425,00:38:24.135,You're here every day. Don't you get a day off?
00:38:24.218,00:38:25.177,"No, every day."
00:38:25.386,00:38:27.305,"-Man, tough schedule. -Mmm."
00:38:28.306,00:38:30.725,What are you going to do with this eggplant?
00:38:30.850,00:38:32.310,I was thinking about a ratatouille.
00:38:32.393,00:38:37.773,Hmm. I like to slice it paper-thin for Parmesan.
00:38:38.190,00:38:39.942,"You know, it soaks up all the juices."
00:38:40.026,00:38:41.068,Okay. Sounds good.
00:38:41.152,00:38:43.696,"You will never, ever taste a better one."
00:38:43.779,00:38:47.408,"I'm sure. Listen, I think you're sweet, and I find you very attractive."
00:38:47.491,00:38:49.035,"-Oh, you think I'm attractive. -You're a lovely person."
00:38:49.118,00:38:50.995,I think that's wonderful.
00:38:51.454,00:38:54.040,But you're not looking for a relationship. Is that right?
00:38:54.123,00:38:55.124,That's exactly right.
00:38:55.207,00:38:58.377,"Well, you have made that perfectly clear, Al."
00:38:59.086,00:39:00.254,You want to have dinner some night?
00:39:01.464,00:39:03.841,What do I have to do? I just don't think you hear me!
00:39:04.091,00:39:07.386,"Oh, I hear you. I hear you real good."
00:39:07.595,00:39:08.846,You know what I think?
00:39:09.096,00:39:14.018,I think we owe it to ourselves to live every single day that we have.
00:39:14.435,00:39:18.564,I feel that I really want to get to know you better.
00:39:18.647,00:39:20.066,Share a meal with you.
00:39:21.776,00:39:22.818,I...
00:39:23.527,00:39:26.447,"What? What is it, baby?"
00:39:26.530,00:39:27.865,I have a roommate.
00:39:44.590,00:39:46.258,-Annie. -Yeah?
00:39:47.176,00:39:49.220,You make a hell of an eggplant Parmesan.
00:39:49.428,00:39:50.638,Thank you.
00:39:50.721,00:39:51.680,World class.
00:39:51.764,00:39:52.890,Thank you.
00:39:56.894,00:40:00.356,"Scrambled eggs, turkey sausage, hash browns, toast and coffee, please."
00:40:02.858,00:40:04.985,"Did you get your hair cut? Oh yeah, Al, I did."
00:40:05.069,00:40:07.279,"And you know what I'm in the mood for? I don't know, Al. What?"
00:40:07.363,00:40:10.157,"Mitzi, you look gorgeous. You smell fantastic."
00:40:10.241,00:40:12.701,"Now go get me some food, because I'm starving to death."
00:40:12.910,00:40:14.912,All right. That's more like it.
00:40:15.871,00:40:17.498,Didn't think you'd be joining us today.
00:40:18.040,00:40:19.208,I'm too old for grudges.
00:40:19.625,00:40:20.960,That never stopped you.
00:40:21.544,00:40:23.712,Talk amongst yourselves.
00:40:23.963,00:40:26.590,Oh! Here! It's in print!
00:40:26.924,00:40:32.930,Wechsler's pensioner's fund and assets to be distributed to current debtors.
00:40:33.305,00:40:37.476,They're using our retirement money to pay utility bills.
00:40:37.560,00:40:40.354,And that isn't all. Check this.
00:40:40.980,00:40:48.946,"Williamsburg Savings Bank will manage the liquidation of the fund, and the restructuring of Wechsler's corporate debt."
00:40:49.280,00:40:51.031,-That's my bank. -That's my bank.
00:40:51.240,00:40:52.616,That's my bank!
00:40:54.076,00:40:56.036,They're stealing our goddamn pension!
00:40:56.120,00:40:57.496,That's what it says.
00:40:57.746,00:41:01.167,"Forty years I worked for that goddamn company, and now they're stealing our pension."
00:41:01.500,00:41:02.835,Get it out of here. I'm not hungry.
00:41:03.169,00:41:04.587,You want to take it home? For go?
00:41:04.670,00:41:07.756,"No! No, leave it here. Nobody's taking anything from me anymore."
00:41:07.840,00:41:09.884,"You know something, Al? You're complicated today."
00:41:09.967,00:41:13.053,I'm not coming back to your table. And no coins.
00:41:13.137,00:41:14.346,I'm not a laundromat.
00:41:23.230,00:41:26.108,I'm in. I want to rob that bank.
00:41:27.902,00:41:29.069,It's as good a place as any.
00:41:32.114,00:41:33.949,"Well, how do we start?"
00:41:34.074,00:41:37.745,We get in touch with this fellow that my ex-son-in-law deals with.
00:41:38.120,00:41:39.747,Why is he going to help us?
00:41:39.872,00:41:45.920,"Because apparently, this is the best weed in Brooklyn."
00:41:46.420,00:41:48.005,"Man, that's like a pillow."
00:41:48.214,00:41:50.633,"Yeah, but it's a pillow you can smoke."
00:41:50.758,00:41:54.345,"Gentlemen, let's go get our money back."
00:41:54.595,00:41:56.597,-Hear. Hear. -Yeah!
00:42:15.824,00:42:17.952,Twenty-five percent. That's not chicken scratch.
00:42:18.786,00:42:21.330,I could rob a bank on my own. Make 100 percent.
00:42:21.539,00:42:23.541,"I'm sure you can, but this is easy money."
00:42:23.624,00:42:28.045,"None of the risks. Only the reward. You show us the ropes, you get paid."
00:42:28.587,00:42:31.340,Murphy does it right! Shit right there.
00:42:33.467,00:42:34.635,You five-oh?
00:42:36.554,00:42:38.347,We're practically eight-oh.
00:42:51.443,00:42:53.988,How does Jesus know you're cool?
00:42:54.363,00:42:55.489,"No, we're cool."
00:43:01.745,00:43:02.830,What's the matter?
00:43:03.747,00:43:07.876,"What do you think of these guys, huh? What do you think?"
00:43:11.171,00:43:13.507,"-Aw, can I hold him? -Good or bad?"
00:43:13.757,00:43:14.967,-Do you want to go with him? -Can I?
00:43:15.926,00:43:17.219,He says okay.
00:43:19.013,00:43:20.848,He takes the whole bottle.
00:43:21.807,00:43:23.350,Tiny little fella.
00:43:23.767,00:43:26.270,I find this one in a drainage ditch.
00:43:26.478,00:43:27.730,-No! -Yeah.
00:43:27.938,00:43:30.107,People have no heart these days.
00:43:30.399,00:43:32.568,So what makes you think you can pull it off?
00:43:32.651,00:43:36.196,"Well, I don't know. Thought we'd give it a go."
00:43:36.280,00:43:40.409,"Well, I don't know. We'll just give it a go."
00:43:40.492,00:43:43.537,"You could get life! Which I guess for you, isn't that long."
00:43:43.621,00:43:46.749,"But you better think, old man, and you better know."
00:43:46.832,00:43:49.668,This is not sitting on a park bench playing bingo.
00:43:49.752,00:43:51.462,"Listen, fella."
00:43:51.629,00:43:54.590,I don't have to take shit from you.
00:43:54.965,00:43:57.134,I get enough of this crap out there.
00:43:57.676,00:44:00.638,"In 20 days, I will not have a roof over my head."
00:44:01.055,00:44:05.476,My social security check is a joke and my pension is tits up.
00:44:05.976,00:44:09.271,Us three are going to go through with it. We are going to go through with it.
00:44:09.647,00:44:12.399,"If you want to make 25 percent helping us, that's fine."
00:44:12.483,00:44:15.736,But if you don't keep the bullshit to yourself!
00:44:18.155,00:44:20.115,"That was a good speech, bro."
00:44:21.533,00:44:22.660,You going to help us?
00:44:27.623,00:44:28.582,Mañana.
00:44:31.377,00:44:32.461,Uh...
00:44:33.170,00:44:34.963,You got any snacks?
00:44:39.176,00:44:40.552,-Willie? -Huh?
00:44:41.095,00:44:43.806,I love the feeling of the air on my face.
00:44:44.139,00:44:45.099,Me too.
00:44:45.182,00:44:48.977,"Oh, my God! Look out. We got little baby junkies here."
00:44:49.186,00:44:52.731,I think I'll get a prescription for this.
00:44:52.940,00:44:54.691,-Me too. -Heh.
00:45:09.790,00:45:12.960,This food is excellent tonight.
00:45:13.168,00:45:14.628,They must've changed recipes.
00:45:14.711,00:45:17.423,Same crap. You got the munchies.
00:45:17.506,00:45:18.715,Hey. You mind?
00:45:18.966,00:45:19.925,Take 'em both.
00:45:20.008,00:45:21.135,Okay.
00:45:22.761,00:45:26.098,"How much time do you think you've got, Willie?"
00:45:29.810,00:45:30.978,I don't know.
00:45:31.061,00:45:32.771,Take a guess.
00:45:33.981,00:45:35.107,"Two, three years?"
00:45:35.315,00:45:38.527,That's it? You look great!
00:45:39.611,00:45:42.030,Just a feeling. You asked.
00:45:43.323,00:45:44.366,What about you?
00:45:44.450,00:45:47.995,"Oh, I'd guess, uh, seven years."
00:45:49.746,00:45:51.290,"What about you, Al?"
00:45:51.373,00:45:54.001,I have bad luck. I'll probably live to be 100.
00:45:55.419,00:45:57.212,Then you can do both eulogies.
00:45:57.296,00:45:58.297,Got it.
00:45:58.380,00:46:01.800,So that's 27 years total.
00:46:02.009,00:46:06.305,"Our pensions average $45,000 a year."
00:46:07.014,00:46:07.973,That's...
00:46:11.310,00:46:17.983,One million two hundred and fifteen thousand dollars is what we withdraw from the bank.
00:46:18.233,00:46:21.570,"Hey, hey, hey! What if we get more?"
00:46:21.778,00:46:23.197,We give it to charity.
00:46:23.405,00:46:26.408,"Yeah, but what if we get less? I'm not going to go through this twice."
00:46:30.287,00:46:32.039,Hey! That's our bank right there.
00:46:32.122,00:46:33.749,"Wait a second, you're going to rob your own bank?"
00:46:33.957,00:46:35.083,It's personal.
00:46:35.375,00:46:37.377,Okay. We skip lesson number one.
00:46:37.628,00:46:39.213,What was lesson number one?
00:46:39.296,00:46:41.089,Never rob your own bank.
00:46:43.467,00:46:46.220,I've got 20 days before I lose my house.
00:46:48.639,00:46:52.684,Ten different people will take the same place ten different ways.
00:46:52.768,00:46:56.730,You need to come up with a plan that is special for you.
00:47:14.748,00:47:17.376,"Cameras aquí, aquí."
00:47:17.793,00:47:19.044,One entrance.
00:47:19.127,00:47:20.462,One emergency exit.
00:47:21.129,00:47:23.840,The right getaway car is very important.
00:47:24.174,00:47:26.760,Find something they'll never suspect.
00:47:47.614,00:47:48.490,Good.
00:47:51.618,00:47:54.121,"Now I realize you guys are 4,000 years old."
00:47:54.204,00:47:55.664,That is fabulous.
00:47:55.747,00:47:59.459,"But under those masks, you're going to need to feel like you're 20."
00:47:59.543,00:48:00.669,Wait! Wait! Wait!
00:48:09.303,00:48:10.971,Now this is crucial.
00:48:11.054,00:48:13.307,You have to have a solid alibi.
00:48:13.390,00:48:14.850,Wednesday the 15th?
00:48:15.183,00:48:16.810,That's the lodge fundraiser.
00:48:16.893,00:48:18.437,Solid alibi.
00:48:18.687,00:48:22.482,Do we have any volunteers for the T-shirt committee?
00:48:24.192,00:48:26.612,Please put your hands down in back.
00:48:26.695,00:48:30.907,We're trying to see if there are volunteers for the T-shirt committee.
00:48:31.199,00:48:34.077,"We are volunteering, Milton."
00:48:37.581,00:48:38.832,All right.
00:48:46.423,00:48:51.094,"Now, they'll give you one if they can, but they will never endanger lives to do it."
00:49:13.075,00:49:24.002,"The average police response time to a robbery in progress is between two and four minutes, depending on how near a unit is to the scene and how many other police calls are in the vicinity."
00:49:25.962,00:49:27.297,Everything's on the damn Internet.
00:49:27.506,00:49:30.175,Set your stopwatches to two minutes.
00:49:30.926,00:49:33.053,And walk it like it's the real deal.
00:49:48.026,00:49:49.986,"Four minutes, 54 seconds."
00:49:50.070,00:49:53.532,"Right now, you would all be in the back of a cop car."
00:49:57.661,00:50:01.081,Your guns are only there for the worst-case scenario.
00:50:01.581,00:50:06.795,"You need to know how to shoot, but the last thing you want to do is shoot anybody."
00:50:06.878,00:50:07.838,Who's on the door?
00:50:07.921,00:50:10.173,I'll handle that. Stand guard. Keep watch.
00:50:10.340,00:50:11.758,You know how to handle a gun?
00:50:28.650,00:50:30.152,the better you'll be.
00:50:30.944,00:50:38.201,"And come showtime, you will stroll out of that bank with more money than you've ever seen."
00:50:39.911,00:50:41.204,Piece of cake.
00:50:43.874,00:50:46.293,Maybe the cops will be slow.
00:50:59.264,00:51:04.269,Attica! Attica!
00:51:04.561,00:51:06.188,I don't want to watch the ending.
00:51:07.439,00:51:09.232,"Yeah, that didn't work out too well."
00:51:11.651,00:51:13.236,How can he sleep?
00:51:14.029,00:51:15.489,He's getting laid.
00:51:15.697,00:51:16.656,"Oh, yeah."
00:51:17.365,00:51:19.075,I remember what that was like.
00:51:24.206,00:51:25.415,You feeling good?
00:51:26.166,00:51:28.502,Yeah. Yeah. Good as gold.
00:51:30.253,00:51:31.755,Me too.
00:51:34.883,00:51:36.218,Nobody's going to get hurt.
00:51:36.551,00:51:37.886,That's right.
00:51:41.181,00:51:42.808,"We get into trouble, we're out of there."
00:51:42.891,00:51:44.184,That's right. Yeah.
00:51:44.351,00:51:46.812,"Cops come, we lay down."
00:51:47.103,00:51:48.480,Hands in the air.
00:51:49.064,00:51:50.065,Two minutes tops.
00:51:50.357,00:51:52.108,Tops. Give or take.
00:52:04.579,00:52:06.456,"Get some sleep, young man."
00:52:06.581,00:52:10.335,"All right. You too, young man."
00:53:14.733,00:53:15.942,You do this every day?
00:53:16.026,00:53:17.360,-Every day. -No shit.
00:53:17.444,00:53:18.528,Yes shit.
00:53:19.446,00:53:21.239,I wish my dad did this for me.
00:53:21.489,00:53:22.782,So does your daughter.
00:53:23.825,00:53:26.328,What are you doing here?
00:53:26.536,00:53:28.496,He's making Brook's breakfast.
00:53:28.705,00:53:31.499,I see that. Why?
00:53:31.583,00:53:34.711,I'm training him. He's making an effort to be a father.
00:53:37.839,00:53:40.508,Good morning.
00:53:40.842,00:53:42.510,Your father made you breakfast.
00:53:42.719,00:53:43.762,Holy shit!
00:53:43.887,00:53:45.221,-Easy! -Language.
00:53:45.555,00:53:46.514,Sorry.
00:53:47.641,00:53:50.685,Your father will be picking you up today.
00:53:51.853,00:53:53.688,Did he find Jesus or something?
00:53:53.772,00:53:57.901,Doubtful. He's figured out how much he's missing.
00:53:58.526,00:54:00.362,"Yeah, this week."
00:54:00.987,00:54:03.490,He's just not much with the follow-through.
00:54:03.698,00:54:06.785,"Give him a shot, babe. For me."
00:54:06.868,00:54:10.330,"Sure, Joe. But only because you're my best friend."
00:54:12.415,00:54:13.833,"I love you, kiddo."
00:54:14.751,00:54:15.835,You're going to do it all.
00:54:17.253,00:54:18.797,What's going with you today?
00:54:19.005,00:54:20.507,Do you have cancer or something?
00:54:21.174,00:54:23.802,"No! No, no. I'm as strong as an ox."
00:54:24.094,00:54:24.970,Okay.
00:54:25.053,00:54:26.680,It's carnival day. Lots to do.
00:54:26.763,00:54:28.556,Yes. I'm coming right after school.
00:54:28.640,00:54:32.352,"Yup, and I'm going to bring you fried dough with your name on it."
00:54:37.065,00:54:40.527,Okay. That's a little tight there. I love you too.
00:54:44.072,00:54:46.491,Go make something of yourself.
00:54:47.701,00:54:48.785,"I will, young man."
00:54:49.619,00:54:51.913,"See you later, Dad."
00:55:10.515,00:55:13.935,"I've been giving you crap for a long time, Murphy."
00:55:15.145,00:55:17.522,I guess I deserve it. Mostly.
00:55:17.605,00:55:20.066,That's one of the smartest things you ever said.
00:55:22.986,00:55:24.195,"Listen, Joe."
00:55:24.404,00:55:27.449,"Whatever it is you're doing, you don't have to do it."
00:55:28.450,00:55:29.784,There's always another way.
00:55:30.035,00:55:34.497,"My business is my business, kid. Forget that you know it."
00:55:34.664,00:55:37.333,"And if in the end, I don't come back, it's on you."
00:55:37.625,00:55:41.129,I can't cover for you anymore.
00:55:41.337,00:55:43.214,You're her father.
00:55:43.298,00:55:46.551,You got to step up to the plate. Act like a man.
00:55:47.635,00:55:49.387,Even if you have to fake it.
00:55:52.140,00:55:53.224,All right.
00:56:06.404,00:56:09.365,"Okay, gents. Let's mingle."
00:56:26.382,00:56:28.301,Three in a row wins a prize!
00:56:32.555,00:56:35.183,"Hello, Paulie. Hot enough for you?"
00:56:35.391,00:56:37.560,Perfect day for it.
00:56:37.644,00:56:39.521,I've got to check in at the ticket office.
00:56:40.063,00:56:42.440,"Well, be good."
00:56:42.524,00:56:44.943,I won't be good. But I will be careful.
00:56:49.280,00:56:52.325,"Okay, here you go. Thank you."
00:56:55.954,00:56:57.664,You folks are popular.
00:56:57.747,00:57:00.375,Yeah. It's the cocaine.
00:57:01.668,00:57:02.877,You've got cocaine?
00:57:03.086,00:57:04.379,"That was a joke, Milton."
00:57:04.587,00:57:07.549,"Oh, okay, very funny."
00:57:07.632,00:57:10.260,Hang here for one minute. I got to go to the karaoke thing.
00:57:13.429,00:57:15.640,"Milton, that's where you are right now."
00:57:15.890,00:57:16.766,Oh.
00:57:17.016,00:57:19.310,It's okay. You're better off not knowing.
00:57:22.897,00:57:26.151,We're closed. We're out of cocaine.
00:57:26.609,00:57:28.069,Go away.
00:57:28.153,00:57:29.487,Beat it.
00:57:45.378,00:57:47.088,"All right, watch your step."
00:57:50.383,00:57:52.510,"I'm going in, Sam."
00:57:56.139,00:57:57.098,I thought you had 'em!
00:58:06.941,00:58:09.736,I decided we should use blanks.
00:58:09.819,00:58:12.113,No one needs to get hurt by accident.
00:58:12.322,00:58:14.365,"Well, it's just us now, kids."
00:58:14.574,00:58:20.330,"Fellas, it's been a real hell of a time planning a heist with you."
00:58:22.832,00:58:25.293,Can't think of two people I'd rather have done it with.
00:58:25.502,00:58:27.253,Hear. Hear.
00:58:27.879,00:58:29.088,Ditto.
00:59:07.210,00:59:09.003,Kiss the ground. Don't breathe.
00:59:09.170,00:59:13.383,Don't move. Don't touch the silent alarm unless you like bullets flying around your head.
00:59:13.800,00:59:16.678,"Hit the dirt, big guy! Put that gun away."
00:59:16.928,00:59:19.973,"Okay, folks, we'll be out of your lives in two minutes."
00:59:21.307,00:59:22.767,"Get moving, Blue Eyes."
00:59:24.143,00:59:26.980,"All tellers, please stand up and open your windows."
00:59:41.869,00:59:43.288,"Yes, Mr. Sinatra."
00:59:45.081,00:59:46.499,Nobody's gonna get hurt.
00:59:51.879,00:59:52.839,"Here you go, ma'am."
00:59:52.922,00:59:54.340,No funny business. Do you know what that means?
00:59:54.424,00:59:55.383,I do. I do.
01:00:06.019,01:00:08.062,"You can have her, mister."
01:00:25.163,01:00:27.999,"We have a robbery in progress. Repeat, we have a 10-30..."
01:00:30.043,01:00:31.836,"I don't want to take your doll, sweetheart."
01:00:32.462,01:00:35.089,"You know, when my granddaughter was your age, she had one just like it."
01:00:35.423,01:00:36.549,What's her name?
01:00:36.633,01:00:39.260,"Okay, honey. This man has a job to do."
01:00:39.344,01:00:41.054,His job's robbing banks?
01:00:41.346,01:00:44.849,"No, sweetheart. Just trying to see my family more often."
01:00:55.193,01:00:56.778,"You okay, mister?"
01:00:59.614,01:01:01.699,He's going to need a little help.
01:01:06.954,01:01:07.914,Stay put.
01:01:10.333,01:01:11.376,Lucy!
01:01:12.293,01:01:14.170,His mask's too hot for him.
01:01:19.634,01:01:22.387,"I can't breathe when I wear masks, neither."
01:01:26.683,01:01:27.725,Two minutes.
01:01:37.110,01:01:38.569,Can you make it out of here?
01:01:43.991,01:01:45.493,"And don't rob banks, you hear me?"
01:01:46.494,01:01:47.453,Hurry!
01:01:51.457,01:01:53.000,This is my bank!
01:01:54.836,01:01:56.671,-Freeze! -Me freeze?
01:01:56.754,01:01:59.006,You don't tell me to freeze. You freeze!
01:01:59.090,01:02:01.634,I'm not going to be a victim anymore.
01:02:01.718,01:02:03.469,Tell them to freeze too.
01:02:06.681,01:02:07.849,I'm working on one.
01:02:08.057,01:02:11.728,Put your hands up and drop the money.
01:02:11.894,01:02:14.981,"Okay, in three seconds, I'm going to shoot you."
01:02:16.107,01:02:17.275,I'll shoot back!
01:02:21.279,01:02:22.238,Two!
01:02:24.365,01:02:25.783,Next number's three!
01:02:25.867,01:02:27.076,I can count.
01:02:27.326,01:02:29.203,He's going to bloody shoot us.
01:02:49.932,01:02:52.185,Now you're going to meet your maker.
01:02:57.482,01:02:59.150,"Oh, my God!"
01:02:59.442,01:03:03.780,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
01:03:03.863,01:03:05.990,"Oh, my God!"
01:03:10.203,01:03:12.538,"Those were blanks, you dipshit."
01:03:17.043,01:03:19.796,And don't stand up until you get there.
01:03:19.921,01:03:21.297,Start counting!
01:03:37.980,01:03:38.981,"What's going on, Willie?"
01:03:39.065,01:03:41.943,"Nothing. I just got a little overwhelmed, that's all. I'm good."
01:03:42.026,01:03:43.820,That was a hell of a time for a panic attack!
01:03:43.903,01:03:44.737,I'm sorry.
01:03:44.821,01:03:46.030,No need for that. We made it.
01:03:46.197,01:03:49.951,Hard part's over. Now's the time for the grand finale.
01:04:15.268,01:04:16.227,Taxi! Taxi!
01:04:16.310,01:04:17.520,All right.
01:04:19.188,01:04:20.690,"Astoria, Queens, please."
01:04:54.682,01:04:56.475,He's not going to stop anytime soon.
01:05:06.944,01:05:08.613,can I interest you in dessert?
01:05:08.696,01:05:10.448,What kind of pie do you have?
01:05:10.656,01:05:14.452,"We have Key lime, vegan pumpkin, cherry-mango..."
01:05:14.660,01:05:15.912,A slice of each.
01:05:15.995,01:05:18.080,And more champagne.
01:05:18.247,01:05:19.415,"Yeah, more champagne."
01:05:20.082,01:05:21.083,Champagne it is.
01:05:53.366,01:05:57.703,"-Whoa, no more booze for you. -Steady there, lightweight."
01:05:58.245,01:06:00.164,-Hey... -It's not the booze.
01:06:00.331,01:06:03.542,"What? Wait, it's not the booze?"
01:06:03.751,01:06:07.129,Hey! Can you please call an ambulance? Please?
01:06:08.381,01:06:09.924,"Where does it hurt, Willie?"
01:06:10.841,01:06:12.385,Everywhere.
01:06:13.636,01:06:14.595,"Oh, God."
01:06:14.804,01:06:17.473,"-Oh, shit. -Pull him up. It's wet."
01:06:17.556,01:06:18.808,Call an ambulance!
01:06:25.439,01:06:26.899,Zoom in.
01:06:28.651,01:06:30.486,Freeze frame there.
01:06:31.737,01:06:33.072,African-American?
01:06:33.155,01:06:34.115,Appears so.
01:06:34.323,01:06:37.451,Got to be at least late 60s.
01:06:38.244,01:06:39.578,Get stills of the others.
01:06:39.912,01:06:42.289,I want them plastered everywhere.
01:06:43.207,01:06:44.917,He never talked about this?
01:06:45.167,01:06:46.252,Not a peep.
01:06:47.503,01:06:49.255,He holds things very close to the vest.
01:06:49.338,01:06:51.298,He's very tight emotionally.
01:06:51.382,01:06:52.550,Hmm. Well...
01:06:53.509,01:06:57.471,Willie's in full renal failure. He needs a kidney transplant.
01:06:57.555,01:06:58.639,Or what?
01:06:58.973,01:07:02.184,"Uh, let's just say, he won't leave here without one."
01:07:02.685,01:07:05.062,They must have been very young and nimble.
01:07:05.146,01:07:10.526,"I fired a barrage of shots at them, and they were able to evade all the bullets."
01:07:12.945,01:07:14.780,and the bank has been robbed twice.
01:07:14.864,01:07:20.119,"So, I think I'm going to go back to my job as a barista, where I'm less likely to be shot."
01:07:23.414,01:07:26.083,It was a day of heroism for me.
01:07:26.167,01:07:27.168,Hey!
01:07:30.087,01:07:31.047,We're famous.
01:07:31.255,01:07:33.090,Better. We're infamous.
01:07:33.174,01:07:36.302,Keep it down. We're not out of the woods yet.
01:07:37.595,01:07:40.639,"So, what's going on, Willie?"
01:07:43.392,01:07:45.644,"We're your friends, man. We're all you got."
01:07:47.229,01:07:48.647,"It's my business, guys."
01:07:48.898,01:07:50.316,Your business? Your business.
01:07:50.399,01:07:53.277,"Talk to him, Joe. I can't... You're a selfish old bastard."
01:07:57.656,01:07:59.867,"I don't get it, Will."
01:07:59.950,01:08:02.119,I would have given you my kidney last week.
01:08:03.913,01:08:05.623,Yours is probably no good.
01:08:05.915,01:08:07.541,I still would've given it to you.
01:08:13.047,01:08:15.257,"We're friends, Willie."
01:08:15.466,01:08:18.010,"We're supposed to look after each other, aren't we?"
01:08:19.512,01:08:22.056,"Well, let us do it. Okay?"
01:08:32.691,01:08:35.903,and possibly in their late 60s or early 70s.
01:08:35.986,01:08:41.951,"They were disguised as the Rat Pack, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, and Sammy Davis Jr."
01:08:43.619,01:08:44.703,Let's get out of here.
01:08:44.787,01:08:48.207,The FBI has just released this surveillance video of the robbery.
01:08:48.290,01:08:51.752,"If you have any information, please call the number on our screen."
01:08:56.674,01:08:59.468,I knew it. I knew when I saw that bank surveillance.
01:08:59.718,01:09:01.929,"Same height, same weight."
01:09:02.930,01:09:04.306,A lot of people fit that bill.
01:09:04.390,01:09:06.016,"Yeah, but who runs like that?"
01:09:15.192,01:09:16.652,We're going to need a copy of this.
01:09:16.735,01:09:19.405,Got one right here. Uh-uh.
01:09:19.738,01:09:21.407,I believe there's a reward.
01:09:21.490,01:09:22.700,A reward?
01:09:22.908,01:09:25.744,Yeah. I need the money. My grandma got locked up last night.
01:09:26.036,01:09:27.496,"You know how it is, right, brother?"
01:09:43.470,01:09:45.222,-Annie. -Yeah.
01:09:45.472,01:09:46.807,I have to talk to you.
01:09:48.434,01:09:50.102,I lost this tooth last week.
01:09:50.477,01:09:51.645,Did the tooth fairy come?
01:09:51.729,01:09:52.980,He brought me five dollars.
01:09:53.063,01:09:55.441,Five... You're kidding.
01:09:55.566,01:09:57.443,You know the most I ever got was a quarter?
01:09:57.735,01:10:00.112,"You can't buy anything with quarters anymore, Grandpa."
01:10:00.321,01:10:01.322,Tell me about it.
01:10:02.198,01:10:03.699,-Willie? -Huh?
01:10:04.700,01:10:06.327,These men are with the FBI.
01:10:11.999,01:10:13.792,Must be bringing me a kidney.
01:10:22.551,01:10:23.636,"Way to go, kiddo."
01:10:23.719,01:10:24.887,Yes!
01:10:25.221,01:10:26.805,That's my girl!
01:10:40.569,01:10:43.030,Hey! I've got to go and find a bathroom.
01:10:43.155,01:10:44.531,"All right, man."
01:10:45.491,01:10:47.076,"That was awesome, Brook."
01:11:19.358,01:11:23.821,"Old man finds himself in the middle of a bank robbery, and he gets his juices flowing."
01:11:24.113,01:11:28.158,"And he thinks to himself, I could rob a bank."
01:11:28.993,01:11:29.952,I'm smart.
01:11:30.411,01:11:32.204,I've got nothing to lose.
01:11:32.621,01:11:34.290,What's the worst that can end up happening?
01:11:34.373,01:11:39.920,"I can end up spending the last years of my life in some country club style prison, rent-free."
01:11:40.296,01:11:42.006,You go to school for that?
01:11:45.592,01:11:51.140,"Well, Mr. Garner, we seem to be missing one hour of your existence."
01:11:51.598,01:11:54.601,Between 2:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m.
01:11:54.685,01:12:01.692,The same hour that three elderly gentlemen robbed 2.3 million dollars from the Williamsburg Savings Bank.
01:12:06.989,01:12:09.825,You were working the haunted house ride between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.?
01:12:09.908,01:12:10.868,That's what I said.
01:12:11.577,01:12:13.037,And you never left that ride?
01:12:13.370,01:12:15.873,Only to go inside. Scare the kids.
01:12:21.670,01:12:23.380,I walked my granddaughter to school.
01:12:23.464,01:12:24.923,Like I do every day.
01:12:25.299,01:12:29.470,"Well, it's a fairly new relationship, so we spend a lot of time together."
01:12:29.553,01:12:33.891,"Let's see, first thing in the morning, we made love twice."
01:12:36.727,01:12:37.978,No.
01:12:38.187,01:12:39.188,Three times.
01:12:40.689,01:12:41.648,And that was it.
01:12:43.317,01:12:44.485,Annie Santori.
01:12:48.364,01:12:50.324,"And then, I got dressed."
01:12:53.494,01:12:54.536,I go there...
01:12:54.828,01:12:57.122,Couple of times a week at least.
01:12:57.206,01:12:59.124,For years. He's a regular.
01:13:00.918,01:13:02.961,You seeing anybody?
01:13:03.253,01:13:05.089,I'm married with two kids.
01:13:05.297,01:13:07.925,"Well, take my number. Things happen."
01:13:09.218,01:13:10.594,I got dressed.
01:13:10.969,01:13:13.514,I gathered the tickets for the ride booth.
01:13:13.597,01:13:15.516,I'm on that committee for the fundraiser.
01:13:15.974,01:13:18.602,"All right, boys, good luck to us all."
01:13:19.061,01:13:21.397,Time to get in the bag.
01:13:22.022,01:13:23.774,Got to the park around 2:00 p.m.
01:13:23.857,01:13:28.612,"Talked to my friend Paul for a few minutes, then ran one of the ticket booths."
01:13:29.071,01:13:30.030,"Hi, Tony."
01:13:30.114,01:13:31.073,Good afternoon.
01:13:31.323,01:13:32.699,I've got you a souvenir.
01:13:32.908,01:13:34.868,"Oh, thanks, Joe. I needed a hat."
01:13:37.663,01:13:39.790,You can ask anyone who bought a ticket.
01:13:39.873,01:13:43.419,They'll tell you they got it from a handsome old gent in a gray flat cap.
01:13:45.546,01:13:52.010,"Then we went to the fair, and I was at the cotton candy stand till 2:00, and then Mr. Milton Kupchak relieved me."
01:13:52.428,01:13:55.055,Al was there all day.
01:13:55.305,01:13:56.557,At 2:30 p.m.?
01:13:57.099,01:13:58.517,-Who? -Al?
01:13:58.725,01:13:59.685,Garner?
01:14:00.102,01:14:01.061,Yes.
01:14:01.270,01:14:02.354,He's here?
01:14:04.731,01:14:10.446,"You know, in the cotton candy booth, he tried to sell me cocaine."
01:14:11.196,01:14:13.490,And I'm prepared to testify.
01:14:13.866,01:14:15.451,Kids love the haunted house.
01:14:24.918,01:14:27.296,Frankenstein's one of their favorites.
01:14:28.255,01:14:30.340,Must have been in there over an hour.
01:14:40.851,01:14:45.814,"Yes, I've had stomach issues for years from all the drinking I used to do."
01:14:46.356,01:14:51.778,"It's called diverticulitis, and the doctor says I should probably have a section of my colon removed."
01:14:52.112,01:14:53.489,I don't really like that idea.
01:15:20.224,01:15:21.767,you were...
01:15:23.519,01:15:24.853,going to the bathroom?
01:15:24.978,01:15:25.938,Yes.
01:15:26.104,01:15:29.483,"It's very tedious, but I keep reading material with me all the time."
01:15:29.566,01:15:31.902,Helps pass the time.
01:15:32.444,01:15:37.366,"After that, I found my lady friend, and we rehearsed our karaoke performance."
01:16:08.480,01:16:09.856,Then what happens?
01:16:11.358,01:16:12.651,"Oh, my God!"
01:16:14.695,01:16:15.571,Look out!
01:16:17.781,01:16:18.824,Oh.
01:16:54.651,01:16:56.153,Hit me with your best shot.
01:17:03.201,01:17:04.161,Oh!
01:17:18.133,01:17:21.845,Yeah. It was almost perfect.
01:17:23.180,01:17:25.599,Except let me tell you a little something about criminals.
01:17:27.392,01:17:33.482,They always make one stupid mistake that ends up screwing up the whole plan.
01:17:37.194,01:17:39.446,"I'm going to need you to take a ride with me, Harding."
01:18:24.408,01:18:27.202,"All right. Folks, come up. Hurry up, let's go."
01:18:40.006,01:18:41.216,Let's go. Let's go.
01:18:46.054,01:18:48.598,Right over here. Line them up.
01:19:25.510,01:19:28.597,"I want you to start with that man over there, okay?"
01:19:28.680,01:19:30.640,Get a good look at his face.
01:21:03.316,01:21:04.276,What?
01:21:05.694,01:21:07.028,He's not here.
01:21:08.655,01:21:09.614,Are you sure?
01:21:09.698,01:21:10.949,Yep. I'm positive.
01:21:11.241,01:21:13.827,I got a great memory.
01:21:19.082,01:21:21.626,Hey! You want to have another look?
01:21:21.960,01:21:23.420,Not really.
01:21:26.673,01:21:28.091,Can I go home now?
01:21:30.093,01:21:31.344,Yeah.
01:22:19.684,01:22:21.269,I thought you might not be coming.
01:22:21.770,01:22:23.396,"Well, here I am."
01:22:26.650,01:22:28.610,"So, what's good here, Joey?"
01:22:28.693,01:22:29.945,"Nothing, really."
01:22:30.278,01:22:31.446,Why do you come?
01:22:31.780,01:22:33.365,I like bad coffee.
01:22:33.448,01:22:34.783,Yes. This I understand.
01:22:35.659,01:22:37.577,He has all his shots.
01:22:37.702,01:22:41.247,"Rabies, distemper, Bordetella. He's been neutered."
01:22:41.331,01:22:42.999,All the papers are in the proper order.
01:22:43.249,01:22:44.334,You take your cut?
01:22:44.542,01:22:47.379,No. Not from you.
01:22:48.588,01:22:52.050,It is a culture's duty to take care of its elderly.
01:22:54.552,01:22:57.681,It is a culture's duty to take care of its elderly.
01:23:01.977,01:23:03.186,Where's the tattoo?
01:23:06.982,01:23:08.316,"Henna, mi amigo."
01:23:08.650,01:23:13.488,Show the person with the worst eyes an image he can't forget.
01:23:14.155,01:23:17.617,The policía will be spinning around for years.
01:23:17.909,01:23:20.453,That looks like a gang tattoo to me.
01:23:24.040,01:23:25.333,Very impressive.
01:23:25.792,01:23:27.293,"Eh, it's a tragedy."
01:23:33.383,01:23:36.469,FBI. Behind you. Six o'clock.
01:23:39.889,01:23:43.977,"Agent Hamer, would you like a bad coffee?"
01:23:45.770,01:23:49.816,"I'm a soy latte man, Mr. Harding. I'm lactose intolerant."
01:23:51.276,01:23:52.736,You left that behind at evidence.
01:23:56.072,01:23:57.323,How did you find me?
01:23:57.824,01:23:59.659,"Well, that's what I do."
01:23:59.743,01:24:00.827,I find people.
01:24:07.625,01:24:09.002,"This is my friend, Jesus."
01:24:09.753,01:24:11.629,He fosters dogs.
01:24:11.713,01:24:13.673,"Special Agent Hamer, FBI."
01:24:14.007,01:24:16.092,Jesus Garcia. Queens.
01:24:19.012,01:24:22.932,"Are you adopting a puppy, Mr. Harding?"
01:24:23.016,01:24:25.435,"Yes, yeah. It's for my granddaughter."
01:24:25.685,01:24:27.687,She made the honor roll at school.
01:24:30.482,01:24:32.317,I love puppies.
01:24:32.525,01:24:33.485,You mind?
01:24:33.568,01:24:35.111,"Uh, he might be sleeping."
01:24:35.445,01:24:37.864,That's okay. I won't wake him.
01:24:38.281,01:24:41.034,"Oh, good heavens, aren't you just the cutest little thing?"
01:24:41.576,01:24:43.745,Let me get a look at you with your smushy face.
01:24:48.333,01:24:51.419,"Oh, now that's a great breed. I just love Border Collies."
01:24:51.544,01:24:54.130,"Yeah, they're wonderful."
01:24:54.589,01:24:57.050,"Yeah, come here, little guy."
01:24:59.260,01:25:00.595,He's a cute little fella.
01:25:04.432,01:25:05.892,"Yeah, come over here."
01:25:13.358,01:25:14.859,"Oh, be careful there. He's teething."
01:25:17.987,01:25:18.947,Thanks.
01:25:19.114,01:25:20.448,We don't want you to bleed to death.
01:25:23.118,01:25:29.374,I got to get this little guy back to the house before my granddaughter gets out of school.
01:25:29.457,01:25:31.126,What a nice surprise for her.
01:25:31.251,01:25:32.669,It'll knock her socks off.
01:25:32.877,01:25:35.046,"Do you have a dog now, Agent Hamer?"
01:25:35.255,01:25:36.798,No. It's my job.
01:25:37.090,01:25:38.383,Long hours.
01:25:39.008,01:25:40.385,I couldn't do that to an animal.
01:25:50.478,01:25:53.273,You boys are killing me with these quar...
01:26:14.794,01:26:16.546,Big piece.
01:26:16.963,01:26:18.423,Cut them up.
01:26:25.180,01:26:28.349,Everyone deserves a piece of the pie.
01:26:48.995,01:26:50.413,Thought you were tougher than that.
01:26:50.788,01:26:53.541,I'm not tough. I'm a very sensitive person.
01:26:54.250,01:26:55.835,I'm going to be honest with you.
01:26:56.169,01:26:58.004,I don't really want to die today.
01:26:58.421,01:26:59.505,That's a new one.
01:26:59.589,01:27:05.970,"But, if I do, I just want to say that you've been a terrific roommate and friend for..."
01:27:07.305,01:27:08.389,Twenty-five years.
01:27:08.890,01:27:11.184,Twenty-five years? It's been that long?
01:27:11.476,01:27:13.269,"Seems like 25 days, doesn't it?"
01:27:13.478,01:27:14.479,"Yeah, it does."
01:27:14.729,01:27:16.564,Underwater.
01:27:32.288,01:27:36.876,"...if you're lucky, you get a couple of great friends."
01:27:38.044,01:27:41.714,The people who are right with you to the end.
01:27:42.465,01:27:50.098,"You grow old together, see it all together, do it all together, laugh and cry together."
01:27:51.266,01:27:54.143,Al Garner was one of those guys for me.
01:27:56.771,01:28:00.566,There will not be many men like him.
01:28:00.650,01:28:04.279,Willing to risk all for others.
01:28:04.487,01:28:08.241,"Give you a kind word, or a kidney."
01:28:08.449,01:28:10.910,And complain about it every step of the way.
01:28:18.793,01:28:20.086,He's your problem now.
01:28:20.169,01:28:21.129,Thanks.
01:28:21.212,01:28:25.967,Good luck. May you enjoy every minute of every moment you have.
01:28:26.259,01:28:27.427,We love you.
01:28:28.094,01:28:29.887,"We love you too, young man."
01:29:18.186,01:29:21.064,"I'm gonna revise my estimate, Joey."
01:29:21.356,01:29:22.815,How's that?
01:29:23.733,01:29:25.526,I may be around another 20 years.
01:29:25.735,01:29:27.612,Not with Al's kidney.
01:29:27.779,01:29:29.989,"That's ten years, tops."
01:29:30.156,01:29:31.866,Close enough. I'll take it.
01:29:32.825,01:29:34.160,Here he comes.
01:29:35.244,01:29:36.204,What's the matter?
01:29:36.287,01:29:39.916,My face is killing me. I never had to smile so much in my life.
01:29:40.249,01:29:42.835,So? What's it like?
01:29:42.919,01:29:44.170,What's what like?
01:29:44.378,01:29:46.089,"Being married, dummy."
01:29:47.298,01:29:49.759,I don't know how any of this happened.
01:29:49.842,01:29:52.303,"I mean, I don't even remember proposing."
01:29:52.720,01:29:56.933,"I mean, I feel like a raccoon caught in a bear trap with one leg stuck."
01:29:57.391,01:30:02.146,"She's a terrific person. I mean, she's sexy, we get it on."
01:30:02.271,01:30:06.400,She's a great cook. She likes me the way I am.
01:30:06.651,01:30:08.945,I don't even like me the way I am.
01:30:09.028,01:30:15.535,"Everything is terrific, but I got to tell you, I'm experiencing this very odd feeling. I think it might be happiness."
01:30:17.954,01:30:21.457,Cheers! Your glass is officially full.
