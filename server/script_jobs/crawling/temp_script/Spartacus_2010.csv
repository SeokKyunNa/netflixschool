00:01:28.589,00:01:30.049,Uh! Uh!
00:01:37.890,00:01:40.559,Raaarrhh!
00:01:48.358,00:01:50.611,Come on!
00:01:50.736,00:01:52.029,Uh!
00:01:55.532,00:01:57.242,Yeah!
00:01:58.660,00:02:00.579,Uh!
00:02:02.122,00:02:03.290,Rrrrah!
00:02:35.030,00:02:37.324,Oh what do you know about it?
00:02:37.449,00:02:38.826,Just fucking go!
00:02:38.951,00:02:42.287,Hold your fucking tongues!
00:02:42.412,00:02:44.205,Let the Roman have his say!
00:02:47.001,00:02:50.587,Thrace and the Republic have known their differences.
00:02:50.712,00:02:54.341,We've not always been as brothers.
00:02:54.466,00:02:59.262,"But let us put aside such matters, uniting in just cause."
00:02:59.387,00:03:05.393,"You pushed your way into our land, and now you stand asking for our help."
00:03:05.519,00:03:07.980,Your hand extended?
00:03:08.105,00:03:13.360,I extend no hand.
00:03:13.485,00:03:16.195,Mithridates and his Greeks attack from the east...
00:03:16.321,00:03:18.073,encroaching from the Black Sea.
00:03:18.197,00:03:20.868,Far removed from our villages.
00:03:20.993,00:03:26.832,True. But the Getae take advantage of the distraction.
00:03:26.957,00:03:30.127,Their barbarian hordes amass to the north.
00:03:30.251,00:03:33.172,Barely half a week's march from your villages.
00:03:33.296,00:03:34.715,How many?
00:03:34.840,00:03:36.383,Thousands.
00:03:39.469,00:03:41.555,Align yourselves with Rome!
00:03:41.680,00:03:46.393,Pledge your service to the auxiliary and join us in our campaign!
00:03:46.518,00:03:47.978,To what end?
00:03:48.103,00:03:50.147,TO WHAT END?!
00:03:53.525,00:03:54.818,Victory.
00:03:54.943,00:03:57.278,And how is it to be measured?
00:03:57.404,00:04:00.407,The Getae have raided our villages in the past.
00:04:00.532,00:04:04.078,Raped our women.
00:04:04.203,00:04:06.496,Each time have pushed them back.
00:04:06.621,00:04:07.581,Only to see them return.
00:04:07.706,00:04:09.624,He speaks out of turn.
00:04:09.750,00:04:12.211,Yet the truth falls from his mouth.
00:04:12.335,00:04:17.632,"If we are to align with Rome, the purpose must be clear."
00:04:20.219,00:04:22.637,The Getae dead.
00:04:22.763,00:04:24.264,All of them.
00:04:28.102,00:04:31.772,Dead. All of them.
00:04:49.957,00:04:53.001,The council has decided?
00:04:53.127,00:04:56.504,We go to war.
00:04:56.630,00:04:59.382,I've asked the gods to bless your sword.
00:05:03.386,00:05:08.850,"Once the Getae are wiped from our lands, there'll be no reason to ever pick it up again."
00:05:08.976,00:05:11.937,And what would my husband do without it in his hands?
00:05:13.855,00:05:16.817,Grow crops.
00:05:19.236,00:05:20.445,Make children...
00:05:28.078,00:05:29.663,You'd fight no more?
00:05:29.788,00:05:33.792,Forever.
00:05:42.634,00:05:44.719,How soon do you march?
00:05:44.845,00:05:46.221,First light.
00:05:51.601,00:05:53.436,Then come to bed.
00:05:53.561,00:05:55.563,If one night is all we have left...
00:05:55.689,00:05:57.858,I should make the most of it.
00:06:33.101,00:06:36.938,Be strong my wife.
00:06:44.112,00:06:46.365,I woke expecting my wife beside me.
00:06:47.615,00:06:49.368,She rose early to pray.
00:06:52.037,00:06:53.914,That her husband would stay with her.
00:06:55.498,00:06:57.167,I thought were in agreement.
00:06:57.292,00:06:59.086,We were.
00:07:01.504,00:07:03.965,The gods came to me last night.
00:07:04.091,00:07:05.759,In my sleep.
00:07:05.884,00:07:07.468,What did they show you?
00:07:07.594,00:07:13.392,"My husband on his knees, bowing before a great red serpent."
00:07:13.516,00:07:17.187,The life draining from his veins.
00:07:17.312,00:07:19.106,What meaning did you take from it?
00:07:19.231,00:07:21.108,A warning.
00:07:21.233,00:07:26.571,"If you go to war, you are destined for great and unfortunate things."
00:07:30.700,00:07:33.828,The Getae worship the mountain wolf.
00:07:33.954,00:07:35.914,They place no faith in snakes.
00:07:37.749,00:07:40.252,It was just a dream.
00:07:40.377,00:07:41.544,And if it isn't?
00:07:41.669,00:07:44.047,"I gave my word, Sura."
00:07:44.172,00:07:47.259,Blood and honor.
00:07:47.384,00:07:49.761,It speaks to the man.
00:07:49.886,00:07:54.933,Nothing will keep me from returning to your arms.
00:07:55.058,00:07:58.812,Not the Getae.
00:07:58.937,00:08:00.855,Not the gods themselves.
00:08:04.401,00:08:06.653,The nights grow so cold.
00:08:06.778,00:08:09.114,what am I to do without you in our bed?
00:08:12.492,00:08:14.535,Lift your dress.
00:08:30.635,00:08:35.974,"Keep me close to your thighs, the thought will warm us both."
00:08:55.076,00:08:58.038,Kill them all.
00:08:58.163,00:08:59.373,For you.
00:09:39.954,00:09:42.082,Charge!
00:09:47.754,00:09:49.047,Rahhh!
00:09:53.468,00:09:54.719,Urgh!
00:09:58.848,00:10:00.725,Hold the line!
00:10:04.438,00:10:06.106,Raaa! Urgh!
00:10:06.231,00:10:08.400,I'll fuck your women!
00:10:09.276,00:10:10.860,I'LL FUCK THEM ALL!
00:10:10.985,00:10:12.404,Ahhh!
00:10:15.907,00:10:18.076,Where the fuck are the Romans?
00:10:23.582,00:10:25.833,Show the cunts no mercy.
00:10:25.959,00:10:27.419,Uhh!
00:10:30.464,00:10:32.257,Yaaah!!
00:10:49.274,00:10:51.192,Ahhh!
00:10:59.033,00:11:00.785,Raaa!
00:11:12.088,00:11:14.966,Romans! Forward!
00:11:20.972,00:11:22.432,Where are you going?
00:11:24.767,00:11:26.645,Little late.
00:11:26.769,00:11:28.729,They'd just get in the way.
00:12:07.060,00:12:08.936,My own shit would taste better!
00:12:09.062,00:12:11.439,"I cook what they give us, Drenis."
00:12:11.565,00:12:12.940,Guts and bones!
00:12:13.066,00:12:15.985,while Glaber and his Romans feast on meat.
00:12:16.110,00:12:18.779,"We're the last to eat, the last to share the spoils."
00:12:18.905,00:12:24.285,But always first to be sent against those barbarian cunts!
00:12:24.411,00:12:30.250,Maybe Legatus fucking Glaber rolls out of his nice warm tent and finds his Thracian dogs've returned to the wild.
00:12:31.376,00:12:32.627,Uh hum.
00:12:34.128,00:12:36.172,"Something to add, little man?"
00:12:37.340,00:12:38.675,A word.
00:12:38.799,00:12:40.260,Which word might that be?
00:12:40.385,00:12:41.760,The one I gave the Romans.
00:12:41.886,00:12:44.431,And my body and blood with it.
00:12:44.556,00:12:46.765,"We all did, to push the Getae back."
00:12:46.891,00:12:48.268,We can defend our own lands!
00:12:48.393,00:12:51.020,We gave our word.
00:12:51.145,00:12:55.024,In my village such a thing still bears meaning.
00:12:55.149,00:12:56.901,Your village.
00:12:57.026,00:13:00.447,Is that why you're here?
00:13:00.572,00:13:04.992,"Or maybe you're trying to impress that sweet taste you're always going on about, with stories of war."
00:13:13.710,00:13:15.754,"Struck the mark near, did I?"
00:13:15.878,00:13:20.049,"Words and honor, my great fat ass!"
00:13:20.174,00:13:25.263,All comes back 'round to a pair of tits and a tight little hole.
00:13:53.667,00:13:55.376,The Legatus is here.
00:13:58.463,00:14:03.426,The Legatus needs volunteers to scout beyond the forward line.
00:14:03.551,00:14:07.180,You. Tactical report by sunrise.
00:14:07.305,00:14:09.683,Or go without rations.
00:14:11.225,00:14:13.186,Please would have done.
00:14:13.311,00:14:16.314,We'll finish this discussion later.
00:14:28.034,00:14:30.119,And if we're dead?
00:14:30.244,00:14:34.290,Then my boot will find your ass in the afterlife.
00:15:05.029,00:15:06.113,Ilithyia.
00:15:06.239,00:15:08.533,What if I'd been an assassin?
00:15:08.658,00:15:10.535,I'd be a widow.
00:15:10.660,00:15:14.121,What's the respectful period of mourning before I could remarry?
00:15:14.247,00:15:16.833,You overstep.
00:15:16.957,00:15:18.626,Women are forbidden within the encampment.
00:15:18.752,00:15:19.753,I was discreet.
00:15:19.878,00:15:20.795,Not You?
00:15:20.920,00:15:24.006,Your man helped wisk me through the sentries.
00:15:24.131,00:15:30.430,"After I threatened to run naked through the camp, screaming he laid his hands on the wife of the Legatus."
00:15:37.270,00:15:39.397,Does your father know you're in Thrace?
00:15:39.522,00:15:44.485,Please. He's too busy colluding with the other corpses in the Senate.
00:15:44.611,00:15:47.739,He thinks I'm still lounging at the villa in Capua.
00:15:47.864,00:15:49.115,Far too arid.
00:15:49.240,00:15:51.701,Hasn't rained there since last forever.
00:15:53.160,00:15:54.495,You should have written.
00:15:54.621,00:15:57.081,You would have told me not to come.
00:15:57.206,00:15:59.500,I'm in the middle of a war.
00:15:59.626,00:16:01.085,I brought you a gift.
00:16:04.672,00:16:07.174,Something to remind you of Rome.
00:16:07.300,00:16:09.218,Sestii wine!
00:16:09.343,00:16:14.181,Let me fill up your cup while you tell me about your little war.
00:16:14.307,00:16:17.226,Too brief a tale.
00:16:17.351,00:16:23.190,Mithridates and his army of Greek whores press the legion in the east by the Black Sea.
00:16:23.316,00:16:26.444,Here I sit.
00:16:26.569,00:16:30.657,of the land of piss and shit from simple barbarian raiders.
00:16:31.741,00:16:35.077,Mithridates.
00:16:31.741,00:16:37.371,Victory against him would have your name on every Roman's tongue.
00:16:37.497,00:16:40.583,Cotta leads the assault.
00:16:40.708,00:16:42.126,He steals your laurels.
00:16:42.251,00:16:44.629,He's the Consul.
00:16:46.339,00:16:48.591,Father will be disappointed.
00:16:48.716,00:16:51.803,He secured this position for you to shine.
00:16:51.928,00:16:54.305,And here you sit.
00:16:54.430,00:16:56.641,I'm doing what I can.
00:17:00.186,00:17:03.397,Of course you are.
00:17:00.186,00:17:06.066,I just wish you were back home.
00:17:06.192,00:17:11.238,Father's planning a full day of spectacles and gladiators!
00:17:11.364,00:17:13.366,It's the talk of Capua.
00:17:13.491,00:17:15.159,I hadn't realized elections were nearing.
00:17:15.284,00:17:19.288,Never too early to campaign.
00:17:19.413,00:17:24.752,"If things were heading better, you could be by his side."
00:17:24.878,00:17:27.421,If.
00:17:27.547,00:17:31.551,So serious!
00:17:39.099,00:17:43.771,Come. You haven't tasted your gift yet.
00:18:41.537,00:18:42.538,They're breaking camp.
00:18:42.663,00:18:48.168,"Frightened little gashes, running away with their cocks between their cheeks."
00:18:48.294,00:18:51.338,Retreat would take them beyond the mountains to the north.
00:18:51.464,00:18:52.924,Their torches bear west.
00:18:53.049,00:18:55.593,West?
00:18:55.718,00:18:58.096,They're swinging around to attack the villages below the pass.
00:18:59.055,00:19:01.474,Our villages.
00:19:01.599,00:19:03.225,Slippery little cunts.
00:19:05.144,00:19:06.687,They break for the mountain pass here.
00:19:06.813,00:19:10.441,"It will take them four days at most, to reach the villages below."
00:19:10.566,00:19:15.071,Food. Supplies. Women...
00:19:17.115,00:19:20.994,It's a simple thing to be turned in the mountains at night.
00:19:22.286,00:19:25.081,Perhaps I should send a Roman to properly assess the situation.
00:19:25.205,00:19:28.542,Send the gods themselves.
00:19:31.337,00:19:32.505,Dismissed.
00:19:32.630,00:19:34.507,If we march by midday we can easily...
00:19:34.632,00:19:37.217,Dismissed!
00:19:54.401,00:19:55.987,The barbarians head west.
00:19:56.112,00:19:57.113,So it appears.
00:19:57.237,00:20:00.574,Further yet from Mithridates and the Greeks.
00:20:00.700,00:20:02.618,And the glory you deserve.
00:20:06.497,00:20:07.999,Return to Capua.
00:20:10.626,00:20:13.420,And my father?
00:20:13.546,00:20:16.716,How will he measure the man he so blessed with his daughter?
00:20:20.594,00:20:26.350,"A colossus, towering above the enemies of Rome."
00:20:31.355,00:20:34.483,"Pompous, arrogant, Roman boy-lover!"
00:20:34.608,00:20:35.818,All but called us liars.
00:20:35.943,00:20:36.903,How are you certain?
00:20:37.028,00:20:38.445,You heard at he said.
00:20:38.571,00:20:39.655,Turned in the mountains at night!
00:20:39.780,00:20:42.742,Like he's speaking to children!
00:20:42.867,00:20:43.784,"No, no about the boys."
00:20:43.910,00:20:46.286,Now who's having a laugh?
00:20:46.412,00:20:47.914,Well there is this tickle at the back of my throat.
00:20:48.039,00:20:50.541,That would be the cock Glaber just forced down it.
00:20:50.666,00:20:52.292,if he wants to send his own men let him.
00:20:52.418,00:20:53.920,Won't change the direction of the Getae.
00:20:54.045,00:20:57.506,Glaber is the most dangerous kind of fool.
00:20:57.631,00:20:58.758,One with a title.
00:20:58.883,00:21:04.638,Truth. But perhaps he has better sense when it comes to wine.
00:21:04.764,00:21:05.973,You stole his wine?!
00:21:06.099,00:21:08.768,Only borrowed it. Plan to piss it all back shortly.
00:21:35.711,00:21:36.754,Up.
00:21:36.879,00:21:38.380,Uh. Fuck your mother.
00:21:38.505,00:21:39.632,The Romans sound the call.
00:21:39.757,00:21:42.009,Fuck the Romans.
00:21:42.135,00:21:44.845,"Up Drenis, you drunken goat."
00:21:44.971,00:21:47.473,The Legatus has gained his senses.
00:21:47.598,00:21:50.517,Is there any wine left?
00:21:50.643,00:21:51.894,Your belly holds the sum.
00:21:52.019,00:21:54.605,It may return the balance presently.
00:21:54.730,00:21:57.275,How far to the mouth of the pass?
00:21:57.399,00:22:01.028,"Three days by foot, If we march with meaning."
00:22:01.154,00:22:03.447,A drink would spur my intent.
00:22:05.365,00:22:07.367,My village is only a ways further west.
00:22:07.493,00:22:11.413,My wine is yours after we-- West?
00:22:11.538,00:22:15.375,"We march east, to challenge Mithridates."
00:22:15.501,00:22:17.461,Did the Legatus send his own men to scout the front?
00:22:17.586,00:22:19.672,How the fuck should I know?
00:22:19.797,00:22:23.801,"They blow their fucking horns, a Roman dog barks and the gods shit on me."
00:22:23.926,00:22:26.304,Welcome to the fucking auxiliary.
00:22:40.693,00:22:42.653,"A word, Legatus?"
00:22:42.778,00:22:46.532,Move to formation.
00:22:46.657,00:22:49.327,"Surely you mean west, as the Getae advance."
00:22:49.451,00:22:53.914,Mithridates and the Greeks are of pressing concern.
00:22:54.040,00:22:57.459,You have aligned yourself with Rome.
00:22:57.584,00:23:00.504,I am its body and voice.
00:23:00.629,00:23:04.050,We march east to the Black Sea.
00:23:04.175,00:23:05.968,Fall to formation.
00:23:09.555,00:23:11.849,Fall to formation.
00:23:14.977,00:23:16.854,No.
00:23:19.023,00:23:21.483,You would defy an order from your Legatus?
00:23:21.608,00:23:24.778,I gave my word to defend against the Getae.
00:23:24.904,00:23:28.699,Not to march east to attack Mithridates.
00:23:28.824,00:23:31.369,You will march where you are commanded!
00:23:36.290,00:23:38.251,Urgh!
00:23:40.544,00:23:43.089,Kill them!
00:23:43.214,00:23:44.840,Urrr!
00:23:59.897,00:24:01.399,Urgghh!
00:24:05.861,00:24:07.238,Haaa!
00:24:07.363,00:24:09.156,"Throw, damn you."
00:24:14.828,00:24:17.039,Yah!
00:24:25.423,00:24:27.925,"What have you done, you stupid shit?!"
00:24:28.050,00:24:30.468,He did what he had to!
00:24:30.594,00:24:31.971,Break and go your way!
00:24:32.096,00:24:33.513,West if your lives are there.
00:24:33.639,00:24:36.434,"If not, I could give a fuck."
00:24:36.558,00:24:37.851,Ohh!
00:24:38.685,00:24:40.354,What of the Legatus?
00:24:43.023,00:24:47.111,Leave him in the mud.
00:24:47.236,00:24:50.114,Um! Go.
00:25:31.405,00:25:34.325,No! Ah!
00:25:58.057,00:25:59.975,Urghhh!
00:26:24.417,00:26:26.001,Yah!
00:26:42.226,00:26:44.061,Urgh!
00:26:44.186,00:26:46.021,Rrrraa!
00:26:50.859,00:26:52.986,Uh!
00:26:55.739,00:26:58.033,"Oh God, oh my GOD."
00:27:10.045,00:27:12.881,The village...
00:27:22.349,00:27:25.185,We have to go. Now.
00:27:47.874,00:27:49.084,They haven't followed.
00:28:07.978,00:28:11.357,You were right.
00:28:14.151,00:28:16.236,You had given your word.
00:28:16.362,00:28:19.072,The fault lies with the Romans in breaking theirs.
00:28:23.076,00:28:24.995,You're hurt.
00:28:25.120,00:28:26.746,It's nothing.
00:28:26.872,00:28:29.500,Sura.
00:28:31.960,00:28:33.128,Your tone is disquieting.
00:28:33.253,00:28:34.672,You should be used to it by now.
00:28:44.014,00:28:45.349,I'm all right.
00:28:47.434,00:28:50.396,Of course you are.
00:29:05.160,00:29:06.870,"It's gone, isn't it?"
00:29:08.455,00:29:11.083,The village.
00:29:11.208,00:29:12.543,Everyone we knew.
00:29:15.170,00:29:16.880,We'll move south.
00:29:19.299,00:29:22.428,I had people there once.
00:29:22.553,00:29:24.846,The Getae won't venture that far.
00:29:24.971,00:29:26.682,Not to the risk of thinning their numbers.
00:29:31.895,00:29:33.146,And the Romans?
00:29:35.566,00:29:39.278,Their concern rests Mithridates to the east.
00:29:43.949,00:29:45.367,South it is.
00:29:50.789,00:29:53.292,I wish I had been a thousand men.
00:30:07.806,00:30:10.934,You did what you could.
00:30:11.059,00:30:14.438,You came back.
00:30:16.565,00:30:18.317,Knowing it could mean your life.
00:30:26.992,00:30:30.496,There is no life without you.
00:32:44.797,00:32:47.883,My Tribune dead.
00:32:48.007,00:32:50.928,Now orders recalling me to Rome.
00:32:51.052,00:32:52.471,All from your hand.
00:32:52.596,00:32:55.515,I own my actions.
00:32:55.641,00:33:00.228,"Has been condemned to slavery, courtesy of her husband."
00:33:00.353,00:33:05.108,No! No! NO!
00:33:05.233,00:33:08.361,The shadow of Rome is vast.
00:33:08.487,00:33:12.616,"And you, Thracian, Will die under it."
00:33:37.390,00:33:40.059,Good of you to join us.
00:33:40.185,00:33:42.521,Thought you were dead there for a while.
00:33:42.646,00:33:45.941,He smells dead.
00:33:47.484,00:33:50.570,Argh! AHH!
00:33:50.696,00:33:52.364,You've been out for days.
00:33:57.327,00:33:59.204,We're at sea?
00:33:59.329,00:34:01.665,Upon the Adriatic.
00:34:01.790,00:34:04.543,Bound for Capua.
00:34:04.668,00:34:06.670,Sura...
00:34:06.795,00:34:09.214,Your woman?
00:34:09.339,00:34:10.757,The Romans took her.
00:34:14.011,00:34:17.263,Best to forget her then.
00:34:53.132,00:34:57.220,What if I'd been an assassin?
00:34:57.345,00:35:00.306,Father's in town.
00:35:00.432,00:35:01.975,How shortly?
00:35:02.100,00:35:05.604,He's not very happy with you.
00:35:05.729,00:35:07.940,And his daughter?
00:35:08.065,00:35:11.109,She missed her husband.
00:35:11.234,00:35:15.072,But fears his reappearance has come too soon.
00:35:19.367,00:35:22.328,The games your father presents the people of Capua.
00:35:22.454,00:35:23.956,They begin tomorrow.
00:35:24.081,00:35:24.915,The feast is tonight?
00:35:25.040,00:35:28.209,That's to his purpose in town.
00:35:28.334,00:35:30.503,I would have a word with him.
00:35:30.629,00:35:35.383,It will take more than one to regain his favor.
00:35:35.508,00:35:41.765,The senate chamber is full of whispers over your ...early return.
00:35:44.601,00:35:47.520,Cheers of the crowd will still their tongues.
00:35:47.646,00:35:52.275,"Cheers? How will you draw them, short of victory?"
00:35:52.400,00:36:00.659,"By giving them something few have ever seen: Thracian blood, spilled in the arena."
00:36:00.784,00:36:04.287,When the hearts of the crowd...
00:36:04.412,00:36:07.749,and the senate will beg to follow.
00:36:07.874,00:36:09.208,Get out of my sight!
00:36:10.669,00:36:12.671,Inbred shit whores.
00:36:12.796,00:36:15.674,I should sale the lot of you to the mines. Out!
00:36:15.799,00:36:19.803,Father's returned.
00:36:19.928,00:36:22.055,If he refuses to aid my intentions...
00:36:22.180,00:36:27.686,"He refuses his daughter nothing, when pleaded with teary eye."
00:36:52.836,00:36:57.007,Good citizens of Capua!
00:36:57.132,00:36:59.467,A debt of gratitude for partaking in this celebration...
00:36:59.592,00:37:02.137,of the family name of Albinius.
00:37:02.261,00:37:05.057,Albinius!
00:37:07.517,00:37:13.565,"Your attendance honors the memory of my elders, gone too soon from the realm of the living..."
00:37:13.690,00:37:17.861,"and the joy of a daughter, yet so full of life."
00:37:19.529,00:37:23.408,I repay your kindness with gifts of water!
00:37:23.533,00:37:27.787,Carried from Rome where the gods have seen fit to keep the drought at bay!
00:37:27.913,00:37:32.542,"And gifts of blood, to be spilled in the arena!"
00:37:36.880,00:37:39.007,Quintus Lentulus Batiatus!
00:37:39.132,00:37:41.426,Step forward.
00:37:51.603,00:37:53.688,Present your gladiators.
00:37:56.399,00:38:02.739,"In honor of Senator Albinius and the people of Capua, I give you Barca!"
00:38:02.864,00:38:03.865,The Beast of Carthage!
00:38:08.203,00:38:12.415,Yet his ferocity pales against the titan of the arena!
00:38:12.540,00:38:15.001,The god of blood and sand!
00:38:15.127,00:38:18.755,Crixus!
00:38:23.593,00:38:26.679,Gratitude to Batiatus!
00:38:35.354,00:38:41.569,"And now to Marcus Decius Solonius, and his offerings!"
00:38:48.451,00:38:52.455,In honor of Senator Albinius and the people of Capua.
00:38:52.580,00:38:55.333,I give you six of my finest men!
00:38:55.458,00:38:59.754,Behold Arkadios!
00:39:02.799,00:39:05.135,Preening shit eater.
00:39:05.260,00:39:07.720,A mockery to the profession.
00:39:07.846,00:39:08.554,A mockery is it?
00:39:08.680,00:39:09.639,"Oh, you disagree?"
00:39:09.764,00:39:12.517,Let it pass.
00:39:12.642,00:39:14.811,We're guests of the Senator.
00:39:14.936,00:39:17.605,He's invited us to sit in the pulvinus tomorrow.
00:39:17.730,00:39:19.607,As consolation!
00:39:19.732,00:39:21.776,Only two of my men have been retained to fight in tomorrow's games!
00:39:21.901,00:39:25.822,While Solonius secures half a dozen of his ill-trained simians.
00:39:28.283,00:39:31.619,That man has fingers in all the proper assholes.
00:39:31.744,00:39:33.454,He wiggles them and everyone shits gold.
00:39:36.666,00:39:37.876,Gratitude to Solonius!
00:39:41.171,00:39:47.468,"But water and games are distant praise, for the city that has held the name Albinius as its own."
00:39:47.593,00:39:49.470,More is deserved!
00:39:49.595,00:39:56.978,"And the gods have seen fit to deliver it in the form of my daughter's husband, Legatus Claudius Glaber."
00:39:58.355,00:40:01.233,Newly returned from the savage lands of Thrace!
00:40:18.499,00:40:22.921,More gifts for the people of Capua!
00:40:23.046,00:40:26.591,Six Thracian jackals!
00:40:26.716,00:40:31.012,Deserters from the war against the barbaric Getae!
00:40:31.137,00:40:36.768,To be executed ad gladium in tomorrow's games!
00:40:39.687,00:40:41.314,Well?
00:40:49.906,00:40:52.533,He is well received.
00:40:52.658,00:40:57.455,"Ask favor for him again, and your tears will fall short of notice."
00:40:57.580,00:41:02.419,Right now to more music and drink! Um!
00:41:14.472,00:41:16.766,Thracians.
00:41:14.472,00:41:18.851,Between those animals and Solonius' inferior offerings.
00:41:18.977,00:41:20.645,"A mockery, on all accounting."
00:41:20.770,00:41:22.688,Glaber mentions execution.
00:41:22.814,00:41:24.107,Perhaps a word could lend our men to the task.
00:41:24.232,00:41:26.067,The position has been occupied.
00:41:26.192,00:41:30.029,Good Solonius! I was just marveling at your wares!
00:41:30.155,00:41:32.115,Oh and I at yours...
00:41:32.240,00:41:34.159,Oh you flatter.
00:41:34.284,00:41:36.494,"No, I appreciate."
00:41:36.619,00:41:38.621,"Good to lay eyes, old friend."
00:41:38.746,00:41:41.707,I feared for a time you would be excluded.
00:41:41.833,00:41:44.461,Games absent Batiatus?!
00:41:44.585,00:41:48.465,"Ah, Crixus and Barca."
00:41:48.589,00:41:51.968,They should provide distraction between the more important bouts.
00:41:56.055,00:41:57.932,The Senator beckons.
00:41:58.057,00:41:59.558,"If I miss you at the games tomorrow, Lucretia..."
00:41:59.684,00:42:02.854,Well its unlikely.
00:42:02.979,00:42:05.773,The pulvinus?
00:42:05.898,00:42:08.567,A great honor.
00:42:08.693,00:42:10.153,I'll enjoy your company there.
00:42:13.823,00:42:15.574,I shall witness his heart on a day.
00:42:15.700,00:42:18.411,Parted from his chest.
00:42:18.536,00:42:19.996,And I shall grip the knife.
00:42:38.973,00:42:41.684,I've never beheld such sights.
00:42:43.228,00:42:45.480,Nor will you again.
00:45:13.294,00:45:15.880,The crowd approves his gifts.
00:45:16.005,00:45:17.756,As do we all.
00:45:17.882,00:45:21.135,I've withheld something of note for the last...
00:45:50.582,00:45:52.124,Ready?
00:46:11.936,00:46:12.895,Yaaaa!
00:46:24.115,00:46:26.743,The odds seem out of favor.
00:46:26.867,00:46:29.120,"This Thracian caused Rome a great disservice, father."
00:46:29.245,00:46:32.998,His cowardice led to mass desertion.
00:46:33.124,00:46:35.126,Is his life not ample repayment?
00:46:35.251,00:46:39.004,He must be humiliated in example.
00:46:39.130,00:46:43.426,Solonius was kind enough to offer his services in this act.
00:46:49.806,00:46:52.184,Give the command.
00:47:16.959,00:47:18.294,CROWD: No!
00:47:29.263,00:47:31.474,AH!
00:47:36.521,00:47:38.648,Uh!
00:48:08.344,00:48:10.054,A mockery.
00:48:10.179,00:48:11.514,Be still.
00:48:25.944,00:48:27.572,SURA'S VOICE: Kill them all...
00:48:33.327,00:48:35.954,Yaaa!
00:48:38.666,00:48:41.586,Yaaa!
00:49:37.600,00:49:41.854,Kill.
00:50:08.547,00:50:11.926,"LIVE, LIVE!"
00:50:31.153,00:50:33.656,Well this presents some difficulty.
00:50:33.781,00:50:36.032,The sentence of death holds.
00:50:36.158,00:50:39.411,"But to defy the wishes of the crowd, It's not wise."
00:50:39.537,00:50:40.872,Even for a senator.
00:50:40.997,00:50:43.541,"He gave me grievance, I will not see him freed!"
00:50:44.291,00:50:46.210,"A solution, perhaps."
00:50:46.335,00:50:48.462,"If you will entertain, Legatus?"
00:50:48.587,00:50:56.762,"The Thracian shown promise in the arena albeit against Solonius's inferior stock, I have a batch of new recruits arriving tomorrow."
00:50:56.888,00:51:06.522,"If I were to purchase this man in addition to be trained at my ludus in the Gladiatorial arts, why in his condition, I doubt he'll survive to the quarter moon."
00:51:08.064,00:51:10.026,"LIVE, LIVE."
00:51:13.445,00:51:15.740,"We will be merciful, hm?"
00:51:15.865,00:51:18.784,"and by such, gain the favor you seek."
00:51:21.370,00:51:24.248,what name does the man carry.
00:51:24.373,00:51:26.625,I never cared to ask.
00:51:27.752,00:51:33.049,"The way he fights, like the legend of the Thracian king of old."
00:51:37.469,00:51:39.513,Spartacus he was called.
00:51:50.566,00:51:52.234,People of Capua!
00:51:53.360,00:52:08.166,"this man, this Spartacus, has proven himself in the arena For this Legatus Claudius Glaber and I grant him-- life."
00:52:14.465,00:52:17.175,Spartacus!
00:52:18.510,00:52:20.512,"Spartacus, Spartacus!"
00:52:25.726,00:52:28.604,"Spartacus, Spartacus!"
00:00:45.170,00:00:47.172,Sura...
00:00:53.512,00:00:56.515,When the Romans came...
00:00:58.392,00:00:59.518,I thought I'd never see you.
00:00:59.643,00:01:00.853,Shhh.
00:01:01.854,00:01:04.732,I will always be with you.
00:01:04.857,00:01:08.235,The gods themselves could not keep me from your side.
00:01:08.360,00:01:11.196,I would kill them all for trying.
00:02:15.510,00:02:16.720,Have him taken to the baths.
00:02:16.845,00:02:20.015,But first attend to all that fucking hair.
00:02:20.140,00:02:21.433,Uh!
00:02:25.353,00:02:29.274,Uh! Ahh!
00:02:39.785,00:02:41.453,Dominus.
00:03:22.285,00:03:23.954,The pool's dry.
00:03:24.079,00:03:25.747,Yes we need rain.
00:03:27.749,00:03:29.376,Money would also see it filled.
00:03:29.501,00:03:31.712,"We need that, too."
00:03:33.296,00:03:34.965,How fares your new pet?
00:03:35.090,00:03:36.466,He breathes.
00:03:36.591,00:03:39.053,His cost was enough for us to fill our pool for a month.
00:03:39.178,00:03:39.928,You paid beyond the asking.
00:03:40.054,00:03:42.556,"I paid his worth, Lucretia."
00:03:42.681,00:03:45.392,Spartacus is a corpse yet walking.
00:03:45.517,00:03:48.979,"How long before he takes his place in the grave, dragging your investment with him?"
00:03:49.104,00:03:51.523,Not before he serves his purpose.
00:03:53.192,00:03:55.527,From the Legatus Claudius Glaber.
00:03:57.278,00:03:58.572,His intentions?
00:03:58.697,00:04:00.615,Nudging toward my desires.
00:04:01.825,00:04:03.326,He comes here?
00:04:03.451,00:04:05.954,Two days hence.
00:04:07.706,00:04:09.666,"In words, but the meaning shines."
00:04:09.791,00:04:11.085,He comes to thank me.
00:04:11.210,00:04:12.836,For what?
00:04:12.961,00:04:14.796,For paying too much for the Thracian?
00:04:14.922,00:04:18.800,Spartacus defied Glaber's attempt at assassination in the arena.
00:04:18.926,00:04:24.389,"The people demanded freedom, an embarrassment for the Legatus."
00:04:24.514,00:04:28.060,"I offered an alternative, by purchasing him."
00:04:28.185,00:04:29.477,At inflated price.
00:04:29.603,00:04:35.192,"If Spartacus survives to swear the oath, the arena will be his tomb as first intended."
00:04:35.316,00:04:37.819,If not..
00:04:37.945,00:04:39.487,then his passing becomes an early delight for the Legatus.
00:04:42.741,00:04:46.369,Um. Desires well nudged.
00:04:46.494,00:04:51.583,Huh. There's yet more stroking needed.
00:04:53.794,00:04:57.047,A simple gesture of gratitude from the Legatus falls short.
00:04:57.172,00:05:00.134,Patronage is the reward we seek.
00:05:00.259,00:05:02.427,Nothing less.
00:05:04.930,00:05:07.224,The Legatus as patron...
00:05:07.348,00:05:10.894,His coins will fill our pool to overflowing.
00:05:11.019,00:05:13.230,We'll need to prepare a feast.
00:05:13.396,00:05:14.982,A small one.
00:05:15.107,00:05:18.568,With wine.
00:05:18.693,00:05:22.447,Just enough...
00:05:29.537,00:05:31.999,I'll sacrifice a bull To appease the gods in our venture.
00:05:32.124,00:05:36.086,Well perhaps something smaller?
00:05:37.171,00:05:39.380,"A ram, then."
00:05:39.506,00:05:40.381,To the gods.
00:05:40.507,00:05:44.636,May they bless us with good fortune...
00:06:16.793,00:06:21.048,Well lick my hole.
00:06:22.924,00:06:24.218,BARCA: This is the one?
00:06:24.343,00:06:27.888,The Spartacus everyone's been pissing about?
00:06:28.013,00:06:30.098,Spartacus? My name is...
00:06:30.224,00:06:33.352,"No one gives shit to who you were, Thracian."
00:06:33.476,00:06:37.105,I give no shit to who he is.
00:06:39.233,00:06:41.026,What is this place?
00:06:41.151,00:06:42.944,"ASHUR: The afterlife, friend."
00:06:43.070,00:06:45.739,Or least outside its rusted gates.
00:06:45.864,00:06:52.787,"You're now an honored guest of Batiatus, master of the greatest ludus in Capua."
00:06:54.915,00:06:56.708,Ludus?
00:06:56.833,00:06:58.293,A school of training.
00:06:58.417,00:07:06.176,"Where men are forged into gods, blood their ambrosia, the arena, their mountaintop."
00:07:09.263,00:07:11.139,Gladiators.
00:07:11.265,00:07:13.267,The truest of brotherhoods!
00:07:15.476,00:07:21.733,"BARCA: Live the next few days, you and the other recruits will count yourself among us."
00:07:21.858,00:07:23.443,And bare our mark.
00:07:25.362,00:07:28.656,"In the mean, can we fetch you something?"
00:07:28.782,00:07:31.285,Food? Water?
00:07:31.410,00:07:34.121,Maybe some scented oils for your feet?
00:07:35.663,00:07:37.207,Water.
00:07:43.504,00:07:46.091,"Oh, he's slow this one, isn't he?"
00:07:46.216,00:07:48.468,BARCA: What do you expect from a Thracian?
00:07:48.593,00:07:51.263,Smells like fresh shit.
00:07:52.973,00:07:54.433,"CRIXUS: Oh, they all do."
00:07:54.557,00:07:56.559,Except for their women.
00:07:56.684,00:08:01.815,They smell like piss and shit.
00:08:05.444,00:08:07.654,"What are you, then?"
00:08:07.779,00:08:09.990,"I'm a Gaul, little man."
00:08:10.115,00:08:15.370,The greatest of my kind.
00:08:15.495,00:08:16.663,A Gaul.
00:08:18.248,00:08:23.211,That explains why you smell like a woman.
00:08:32.846,00:08:35.223,Oh you tend to your wounds.
00:08:35.349,00:08:39.060,Eat. Rest.
00:08:39.186,00:08:43.273,"When you gain your strength, we'll revisit that remark."
00:09:27.567,00:09:29.861,Freak!
00:09:29.986,00:09:33.532,Pile of shit.
00:09:33.656,00:09:36.743,"Well then you should join them, you little cunt."
00:10:01.393,00:10:04.396,What is beneath your feet?
00:10:07.899,00:10:09.401,Answer!
00:10:09.526,00:10:12.695,What is beneath your feet?
00:10:15.615,00:10:16.824,Sand?
00:10:18.826,00:10:19.619,Crixus!
00:10:19.744,00:10:21.871,What is beneath your feet?
00:10:21.996,00:10:23.331,"Sacred ground, Doctore!"
00:10:23.457,00:10:26.918,Watered with the tears of blood!
00:10:27.043,00:10:29.463,DOCTORE Your tears. Your blood.
00:10:29.588,00:10:32.840,"Your pathetic lives, forged into something of worth."
00:10:32.966,00:10:37.637,DOCTORE: Listen. Learn.
00:10:37.762,00:10:40.014,As gladiators.
00:10:40.140,00:10:42.225,"Now, attend your master!"
00:10:50.400,00:10:51.734,BATIATUS: You have been blessed!
00:10:51.859,00:11:00.619,"Each and every one of you, to find yourselves here, at the ludus of Quintus Lentulus Batiatus!"
00:11:00.743,00:11:04.414,Purveyor of the finest gladiators in all of the Republic!
00:11:06.124,00:11:09.294,"BATIATUS: Prove yourselves, in the hard days to follow."
00:11:09.419,00:11:11.838,Prove yourselves more than a common slave.
00:11:11.963,00:11:13.381,More than a man.
00:11:13.507,00:11:15.592,"BATIATUS: Fail, and die."
00:11:15.716,00:11:21.139,"Either here where you stand, or sold off to the mines."
00:11:21.264,00:11:24.809,"Succeed, and stand proud among my titans!"
00:11:24.934,00:11:29.105,Batiatus.
00:11:38.448,00:11:42.118,A Gladiator does not fear death.
00:11:42.243,00:11:46.373,He embraces it.
00:11:50.835,00:11:59.010,"Each time he enters the arena, he slips his cock into the mouth of the beast."
00:11:59.135,00:12:04.558,And prays to thrust home before the jaws snap shut.
00:12:04.683,00:12:06.476,Uh!
00:12:15.569,00:12:17.111,Except one.
00:12:20.532,00:12:25.370,"This sad, battered Thracian stood against four in the arena."
00:12:25.495,00:12:30.833,"Condemned to die, given nothing but a sword to wager his life upon."
00:12:31.876,00:12:34.003,They came at him!
00:12:37.507,00:12:41.469,DOCTORE: Again and again and again!
00:12:41.595,00:12:43.263,Uh!
00:12:45.932,00:12:47.975,Uh!
00:12:49.852,00:12:55.400,DOCTORE: He defied Death! Fate!
00:12:56.735,00:12:58.111,Raaaa!
00:12:59.696,00:13:01.573,Yaaaa!
00:13:03.283,00:13:05.535,Argh! Argh!
00:13:07.704,00:13:09.830,Yaaaaa!
00:13:09.956,00:13:13.084,Spartacus....
00:13:15.211,00:13:17.130,Gaze at this man!
00:13:17.255,00:13:20.467,Study him. And realize...
00:13:21.635,00:13:23.928,he is nothing.
00:13:24.053,00:13:27.223,DOCTORE: A coward.
00:13:27.348,00:13:30.602,"DOCTORE: His victory in the arena, as hollow as his courage."
00:13:30.727,00:13:37.609,"He fought against the ill-trained men of Solonius, your master's rival."
00:13:37.734,00:13:40.320,Had Spartacus entered the arena with any Gladiator here...
00:13:40.445,00:13:42.989,his head would have left well in advance of his body!
00:13:48.077,00:13:50.664,DOCTORE: The Thracian disagrees.
00:13:50.789,00:13:53.207,"A demonstration, perhaps?"
00:13:56.503,00:13:57.878,Crixus!
00:13:58.837,00:14:00.047,Practice swords.
00:14:10.642,00:14:12.935,"Prove us wrong, Spartacus."
00:14:22.862,00:14:24.155,Pick it up.
00:14:29.160,00:14:30.495,Spartacus!
00:14:38.002,00:14:40.004,That is not my name.
00:14:40.129,00:14:41.339,Grrr!
00:14:48.179,00:14:53.017,"Your name, your life, is what we decide."
00:15:14.414,00:15:19.544,Perhaps the coward requires advantage to still his trembling knees.
00:15:21.003,00:15:22.338,Gladius!
00:15:38.438,00:15:39.731,Pick it up.
00:15:43.984,00:15:45.695,I can do nothing with this one.
00:15:45.820,00:15:48.155,Send him to the mines.
00:15:52.452,00:15:53.745,Uh!
00:16:01.920,00:16:03.087,"Feeling rested, are we?"
00:16:14.265,00:16:17.894,An attack must be grounded in proper footing.
00:16:18.018,00:16:24.442,He attempts to press before regaining balance.
00:16:25.276,00:16:26.778,Ahhh!
00:16:28.112,00:16:30.156,GLADIATORS: Crixus!
00:16:41.918,00:16:43.210,Ahh!
00:16:43.878,00:16:45.296,Ahh!
00:16:50.677,00:16:52.762,DOCTORE: Allow advantage to your back...
00:16:52.887,00:16:54.430,and you are dead.
00:17:19.079,00:17:20.707,Oh!
00:17:24.585,00:17:27.296,Become entangled with a more powerful opponent...
00:17:27.421,00:17:29.716,..and you are dead.
00:17:35.429,00:17:37.515,Raaa!
00:17:40.226,00:17:41.602,Uh!
00:17:51.320,00:17:53.322,DOCTORE: Hurl your sword in the arena...
00:17:53.447,00:17:55.867,and you are dead again.
00:18:12.008,00:18:13.718,Your foolishness has cost a life.
00:18:13.843,00:18:17.013,But yours may yet be redeemed.
00:18:17.137,00:18:19.933,Two fingers.
00:18:20.058,00:18:22.810,A plea of mercy to the editor of the games!
00:18:28.983,00:18:31.235,"Beg for your life, little rabbit."
00:18:35.281,00:18:36.616,Bash his skull in!
00:18:37.867,00:18:39.410,BATIATUS: Crixus!
00:18:43.581,00:18:44.749,Dominus.
00:18:44.874,00:18:46.417,Continue training.
00:18:50.170,00:18:53.424,"He tries to kill your best man, and yet you let him live?"
00:18:53.549,00:18:55.551,Glaber visits tomorrow.
00:18:55.676,00:18:58.763,His intention towards the Thracian may include blood.
00:18:58.888,00:19:04.143,Until his patronage is secured I intend to keep it warm and flowing.
00:19:06.813,00:19:09.607,Enough to boil the tongue from the head!
00:20:17.633,00:20:19.802,Raa!
00:20:28.561,00:20:30.396,Eat it!
00:20:50.124,00:20:53.335,"Shit-fucking slaves and criminals, the lot of them."
00:20:54.587,00:20:56.923,Are we the better?
00:20:57.048,00:20:59.008,You survived your own execution.
00:20:59.133,00:21:04.263,"Twice, if you mark the Gaul over there not introducing your brains to the sand."
00:21:04.388,00:21:08.059,"You are of a difference, Thracian."
00:21:08.184,00:21:10.770,Above this unfortunate collection.
00:21:10.895,00:21:12.354,And you?
00:21:13.313,00:21:15.315,Varro.
00:21:15.441,00:21:17.985,The worst of the lot.
00:21:18.111,00:21:22.073,A free man consigned by his own hand.
00:21:22.198,00:21:25.993,Why would a man willingly condemn himself to this?
00:21:26.119,00:21:28.996,"A small matter of debt, grown large."
00:21:29.122,00:21:32.374,The repaying of it proves difficult.
00:21:32.499,00:21:35.086,If the concern was only to me...
00:21:37.213,00:21:39.215,A family?
00:21:39.339,00:21:40.800,Wife and child.
00:21:41.759,00:21:44.553,A boy.
00:21:44.678,00:21:47.765,"Two years in the arena, My winnings will keep them fed."
00:21:48.557,00:21:49.850,Winnings?
00:21:49.976,00:21:52.186,"Fight well, and you're rewarded with coin."
00:21:52.311,00:21:55.106,"Enough even to balance what I owe, the gods be fortunate."
00:21:56.315,00:21:57.942,The gods.
00:22:00.319,00:22:02.155,You are a fool.
00:22:02.280,00:22:05.616,"And in good company, by the judging."
00:22:05.741,00:22:08.035,BATIATUS: They're the best I could do at the moment.
00:22:08.161,00:22:10.163,One or two show promise.
00:22:08.161,00:22:11.289,But the rest my own mother would have them in the arena.
00:22:11.413,00:22:14.125,You have no mother.
00:22:14.250,00:22:15.168,That's why I favor you.
00:22:15.293,00:22:16.460,Were there no better offerings?
00:22:16.585,00:22:17.544,"Better, yes!"
00:22:17.670,00:22:19.005,"Within the reach of my purse, no!"
00:22:19.130,00:22:23.383,You stand questioning and complaining instead of setting yourself to the task!
00:22:23.509,00:22:27.221,"I press to honor you, Batiatus."
00:22:27.345,00:22:28.472,Legatus Glaber visits tomorrow.
00:22:28.597,00:22:30.183,With him hope of renewed fortunes.
00:22:30.308,00:22:33.560,"Till then, these men are all the straw afforded."
00:22:33.686,00:22:36.772,"Bake them into brick, or crumble them to the mines."
00:22:36.897,00:22:39.525,Your will. My hands.
00:22:43.612,00:22:46.657,Ovidius!
00:22:46.782,00:22:49.702,"Accepted, if made with coin."
00:22:49.827,00:22:53.622,"Three months of grain, the payment standing past due."
00:22:53.747,00:22:54.540,"Three, is it?"
00:22:54.665,00:22:58.627,To the day.
00:22:58.752,00:23:00.921,The games of the Vulcanalia approach.
00:23:01.047,00:23:03.007,If I could carry the debt till then...
00:23:03.132,00:23:05.301,"The principle, plus thirty percent."
00:23:05.425,00:23:07.136,Thirty?!
00:23:07.261,00:23:10.264,Or settle the debt as it stands.
00:23:10.388,00:23:14.352,"Huh, principle plus thirty."
00:23:14.476,00:23:16.020,The day after.
00:23:31.744,00:23:33.204,Uh!
00:23:34.705,00:23:36.040,I could have taken him.
00:23:36.165,00:23:40.253,"Crixus? Pff, the shit would be running down your leg."
00:23:40.378,00:23:43.005,"I wouldn't have ended up in the dirt, fucked like a dog."
00:23:43.130,00:23:46.592,"Without training, the Gaul would have bested any of us, Kerza."
00:23:46.717,00:23:48.969,Speaking otherwise is bloated air.
00:23:49.095,00:23:53.140,I pray not to face Crixus in the final test.
00:23:53.266,00:23:57.103,"KERZA: Nothing to worry. You'll never make it that far, cock hole."
00:23:57.228,00:24:00.564,All can make it to the test.
00:24:01.607,00:24:03.609,Freedom.
00:24:03.734,00:24:05.903,VARRO: One day. If you fight well.
00:24:06.028,00:24:10.157,"Freedom, it's piss without the money to keep it, Varro."
00:24:10.283,00:24:13.619,Win the hearts of the crowd in the arena and you'll be blessed with both.
00:24:16.080,00:24:19.041,You fought the gladiators there.
00:24:19.166,00:24:21.085,What do you think of our chances?
00:24:25.839,00:24:27.591,You're all going to die.
00:24:35.224,00:24:40.187,Up! You will sleep when you prove yourselves men.
00:25:00.958,00:25:01.792,Ah!
00:25:01.917,00:25:03.543,DOCTORE: Keep pace!
00:25:12.678,00:25:14.305,It's late.
00:25:15.431,00:25:19.226,It is.
00:25:19.352,00:25:20.811,In a minute.
00:25:23.063,00:25:24.564,We need better wine.
00:25:24.690,00:25:26.817,We need many things.
00:25:27.776,00:25:29.653,"We'll have them, again."
00:25:31.447,00:25:33.449,The arrangements are set?
00:25:33.573,00:25:35.784,I've taken care of everything.
00:25:35.909,00:25:37.453,Cannot fall short tomorrow.
00:25:37.577,00:25:39.705,If I can secure Glaber's patronage...
00:25:39.830,00:25:41.165,You will.
00:25:43.000,00:25:44.668,How are you certain?
00:25:46.170,00:25:48.047,We've done everything we can.
00:25:48.172,00:25:50.216,It's in the hands of the gods now.
00:25:55.846,00:25:57.306,Come to bed.
00:25:58.516,00:26:00.642,And bring that awful wine.
00:26:02.895,00:26:04.688,I beg you.
00:26:05.439,00:26:07.691,Do not fuck me.
00:26:37.555,00:26:38.805,Halt!
00:26:38.931,00:26:41.725,The day's training will begin shortly.
00:26:41.850,00:26:43.227,Eat.
00:26:46.855,00:26:48.566,Eh! Jupiter's cock.
00:26:48.690,00:26:50.817,Now we train all day?
00:26:54.363,00:27:00.744,Still believe every man will live to see the test?
00:27:00.869,00:27:02.955,Mostly.
00:27:03.080,00:27:05.082,"Yet the fool, then."
00:27:07.376,00:27:08.752,SPARTACUS: Batiatus paid for these men?
00:27:08.877,00:27:11.964,"VARRO: Very little, by the look of them."
00:27:12.089,00:27:16.427,The Roman way.
00:27:16.552,00:27:18.762,Some deserving more than others.
00:27:18.887,00:27:22.933,I've heard a certain Thracian was quite the price.
00:27:23.058,00:27:26.061,SPARTACUS: I would see the cost rise higher still.
00:27:32.485,00:27:33.777,Um!
00:27:35.904,00:27:39.450,"BARCA: I recall the hardship of The March, when I was a recruit."
00:27:39.575,00:27:42.495,You must be mad with hunger.
00:27:42.620,00:27:44.288,Fill your bellies!
00:27:58.218,00:28:00.262,Shit.
00:28:06.143,00:28:08.854,Wake me when it's time to die again.
00:28:17.695,00:28:19.323,Apologies for the porridge.
00:28:19.448,00:28:21.950,Barca finds the jest amusing.
00:28:22.075,00:28:23.494,Least he didn't piss in it this time.
00:28:23.619,00:28:26.079,Adds an unpleasant bite.
00:28:26.205,00:28:32.419,The days will be hard.
00:28:32.545,00:28:34.547,You would give me your bread?
00:28:34.672,00:28:37.799,"Mine, no."
00:28:37.924,00:28:40.594,"I move things from here to there, this hand to that."
00:28:40.719,00:28:43.389,Even from outside these walls.
00:28:43.514,00:28:46.600,"Whatever your needs, Ashur provides."
00:28:46.725,00:28:48.894,I owe no man.
00:28:50.854,00:28:53.232,I ask nothing in return.
00:28:53.357,00:28:57.611,My only concern is your strength and well being in the coming day.
00:28:57.736,00:28:59.863,Come to plain words.
00:29:01.574,00:29:03.909,"Simply stated, then."
00:29:04.034,00:29:07.787,"In addition to other services, I offer odds."
00:29:07.913,00:29:09.373,Will this man live?
00:29:09.498,00:29:12.084,How fast? How slow?
00:29:12.209,00:29:15.170,Games to pass the time.
00:29:15.295,00:29:16.422,And how am I fixed?
00:29:16.547,00:29:19.049,"Twelve to the one, favoring the mines."
00:29:19.174,00:29:20.551,Higher towards your death.
00:29:22.094,00:29:25.889,Crixus stands to lose a sum if you defy the numbering.
00:29:26.724,00:29:28.559,I would see it so.
00:29:37.901,00:29:39.194,Ahh.
00:29:41.405,00:29:43.823,Do not think me friend.
00:29:43.949,00:29:45.951,The thought is well removed.
00:30:04.928,00:30:06.346,How did you manage this?
00:30:07.097,00:30:08.932,By playing the odds.
00:30:10.350,00:30:12.852,I fear they're about to worsen.
00:30:46.094,00:30:50.015,Glaber.
00:30:55.061,00:30:59.065,Yet the animal.
00:30:59.692,00:31:00.651,Where is she?
00:31:00.776,00:31:02.110,Who?
00:31:03.862,00:31:05.155,That little wife of yours?
00:31:05.280,00:31:06.031,Where?
00:31:06.156,00:31:08.492,Wherever I please!
00:31:13.872,00:31:15.915,She served you no grievance.
00:31:16.041,00:31:18.043,No.
00:31:18.168,00:31:21.755,None. But you...
00:31:21.880,00:31:23.507,You have grieved me.
00:31:23.632,00:31:25.425,By stirring the auxiliary to desertion.
00:31:25.551,00:31:30.723,"Calling my command into question, imperiling my standing with the senate."
00:31:30.848,00:31:36.395,"And then in the arena you grieve me again, by not knowing when to die."
00:31:36.520,00:31:37.979,"My life, then."
00:31:39.064,00:31:40.691,In exchange for hers.
00:31:40.816,00:31:43.026,Your life is no longer yours to bargain!
00:31:44.778,00:31:50.701,"If I wish it ceased, I have but to whisper and good Batiatus will command it!"
00:31:50.826,00:31:53.203,Then tongue the words in his ear.
00:31:57.374,00:32:00.043,"You mistake me, Thracian."
00:32:00.168,00:32:05.716,True. I once sought death in repayment for your slights.
00:32:05.841,00:32:12.347,But I see the error of that now.
00:32:13.849,00:32:17.227,No. My desires have turned to blood.
00:32:17.352,00:32:21.981,"Spilled by the drop, over time, until you are drained."
00:32:23.066,00:32:24.735,I told you Rome's shadow was vast.
00:32:24.860,00:32:30.240,And you will yet die under it.
00:32:34.912,00:32:36.288,Oh.
00:32:39.792,00:32:44.254,"A parting kindness, to bind us."
00:32:50.260,00:32:57.392,I took it from her thigh to preserve the scent.
00:32:57.517,00:33:01.104,Before my men stained it with their own.
00:33:01.229,00:33:03.857,Raaa! No!
00:33:04.023,00:33:07.736,She was a savage amusement.
00:33:07.861,00:33:10.948,And when the fight finally left her eyes.
00:33:11.072,00:33:15.118,I sold her to an unpleasant Syrian for half a coin.
00:33:21.750,00:33:25.796,You see the Thracian finally learns his place before me.
00:33:28.423,00:33:30.467,On his knees.
00:33:35.263,00:33:36.890,Raaaa!
00:33:37.015,00:33:39.977,"Your visit with the Thracian was satisfying, then?"
00:33:40.101,00:33:41.895,The man is of no more concern to me.
00:33:42.020,00:33:46.065,No none whatsoever!
00:33:46.191,00:33:47.233,I leave for Rome.
00:33:47.359,00:33:48.819,Rome? Now?
00:33:48.944,00:33:51.780,"Errr, something for your trip, then?"
00:33:55.826,00:33:59.245,"You really shouldn't have gone to the trouble, Lucretia."
00:33:59.371,00:34:03.834,These common dishes leave my stomach unsettled.
00:34:03.959,00:34:06.503,"Some wine perhaps, while we wait for your husband?"
00:34:06.628,00:34:07.880,Sestian?
00:34:08.005,00:34:10.924,"No, but something of equal taste?"
00:34:11.049,00:34:12.676,"Water, then."
00:34:15.595,00:34:20.099,The heat and the dust.
00:34:20.225,00:34:22.143,We can only pray.
00:34:22.268,00:34:27.816,Can't place foot on street in Capua without hearing someone pleading to the heavens for a sprinkle.
00:34:27.941,00:34:30.986,And the gods yet ignore us.
00:34:31.110,00:34:34.155,Perhaps we've done something to offend them.
00:34:35.949,00:34:39.160,I try to do a little something everyday.
00:34:40.245,00:34:41.705,"So you're the cause, Ilithyia."
00:34:41.830,00:34:47.460,I'd stand a bit away.
00:34:47.586,00:34:51.548,He'd have to choose between targets.
00:34:51.673,00:34:56.511,And I thought I was in the presence of a proper Roman woman.
00:34:56.636,00:35:01.641,Proper is a word forged by men who would seek to enslave us with it.
00:35:03.769,00:35:04.853,DOCTORE: Kerza!
00:35:34.049,00:35:36.927,Have you ever been inside a ludus?
00:35:37.052,00:35:42.849,No. I've always wanted to.
00:35:42.975,00:35:45.518,You obey his commands?
00:35:45.644,00:35:48.772,Not all of them.
00:35:48.897,00:35:54.360,"How do you live with the noise and the smell, surrounded by these animals?"
00:35:54.486,00:35:57.990,"Yes, they are wild and savage, aren't they?"
00:35:58.115,00:36:02.744,Something out of a fever dream.
00:36:02.869,00:36:06.372,"I mean, what if they went insane all at once, clamoring for blood?!"
00:36:06.498,00:36:09.001,This ludus has been in my husband's family for generations.
00:36:09.126,00:36:10.710,And yet it stands.
00:36:10.836,00:36:15.132,What about your children?
00:36:15.256,00:36:18.718,"Um, I'm without children."
00:36:21.054,00:36:24.850,Oh. Apologies.
00:36:24.975,00:36:29.938,Um.
00:36:30.063,00:36:33.232,Come.
00:36:33.358,00:36:35.861,So soon?
00:36:35.986,00:36:38.864,"Well, can't we stay awhile?"
00:36:38.989,00:36:41.700,Another time. Come.
00:37:15.525,00:37:17.360,Kerza!
00:37:20.197,00:37:23.867,- Pair with Spartacus.
00:37:23.992,00:37:27.037,DOCTORE: Recruits! Attend!
00:37:27.162,00:37:29.873,Show the Thracian what we've learned in his absence.
00:37:41.384,00:37:43.720,Form one. Attack!
00:37:43.845,00:37:45.555,Raaa!
00:37:53.271,00:37:54.647,Ahhh!
00:37:57.192,00:37:59.277,Form two. Attack!
00:37:59.402,00:38:00.904,Yaaaa!
00:38:23.301,00:38:24.510,Raaa!
00:38:25.470,00:38:26.763,Uh!
00:38:27.555,00:38:28.932,Spartacus!
00:38:31.601,00:38:33.352,Spartacus!
00:39:08.305,00:39:10.473,Uh!
00:39:24.279,00:39:27.157,The gods haven't pissed on me enough for one day?!
00:39:27.282,00:39:31.161,"Legatus fucking Glaber spurns me like a common slave, but no!"
00:39:31.286,00:39:34.122,Let's add shit to the piss let's pour it in his mouth!
00:39:34.247,00:39:37.250,If word gets out that Batiatus can't control his own men...
00:39:37.375,00:39:38.668,I warned you of their quality.
00:39:38.793,00:39:42.255,You warn me nothing!
00:39:42.380,00:39:43.965,"My hands, your will."
00:39:45.884,00:39:48.136,"The Legatus, barely beyond my fucking gates!"
00:39:49.595,00:39:52.515,Then school him to our standards.
00:39:52.640,00:39:54.559,Rod and lash fall unnoticed.
00:39:54.684,00:39:58.146,"No. The rest to the gods, they were all of little cost."
00:39:58.271,00:40:04.402,"Spartacus is more highly valued, his worth well exceeding their entire sum."
00:40:04.527,00:40:07.364,I will have return.
00:40:04.527,00:40:09.074,"If not from the Legatus, then from the man himself."
00:40:09.199,00:40:12.118,Even though he is unpredictable?
00:40:12.244,00:40:16.373,"He is but passionate, and he stirs the same in others."
00:40:16.497,00:40:22.254,"A boon to the crowds, if we can but divine the instrument of his taming."
00:40:22.379,00:40:27.884,"He struggled to retain this bit of fabric, even as the Guards beat him."
00:40:28.009,00:40:30.511,It may bring you some service.
00:40:30.636,00:40:34.640,"I noted this in the hand of the Legatus, upon his arrival."
00:40:44.276,00:40:48.071,Bring him to my chamber.
00:41:00.750,00:41:02.252,Why are you here?
00:41:02.377,00:41:06.172,In this place.
00:41:06.298,00:41:09.467,Because I trusted in the honor of a Roman.
00:41:09.592,00:41:14.222,You are here because of my grandfather.
00:41:14.347,00:41:17.016,He built this ludus.
00:41:17.142,00:41:19.894,He believed that no man was without worth.
00:41:24.232,00:41:29.570,"He instilled these beliefs in my father, who in turn passed them on to me."
00:41:29.695,00:41:36.244,"I am a lanista, like my forefathers."
00:41:36.369,00:41:39.122,I see things in men that they themselves have lost.
00:41:39.247,00:41:41.374,A small spark.
00:41:41.499,00:41:46.671,"I give it breath, tinder."
00:41:46.796,00:41:49.382,I burn for no cause but my own.
00:41:49.507,00:41:52.385,And what might that be?
00:41:52.510,00:41:54.346,You've cost me enough on that front.
00:41:54.471,00:41:56.639,"No, not so base a cause for this one."
00:41:56.764,00:42:00.559,"Position, then?"
00:42:04.063,00:42:06.691,"You have a woman, Thracian?"
00:42:08.693,00:42:11.154,And do you love her?
00:42:11.279,00:42:13.323,Of course you do.
00:42:11.279,00:42:14.782,"I can see it in the eye, tensing of the jaw."
00:42:14.907,00:42:18.828,What might be the name of this delicate flower?
00:42:18.953,00:42:20.955,Sura.
00:42:21.080,00:42:22.665,Where is she?
00:42:22.790,00:42:26.294,He took her.
00:42:26.419,00:42:28.880,Legatus Glaber?
00:42:29.005,00:42:30.340,He sold her to a Syrian.
00:42:30.465,00:42:33.092,Well then how do you know she still lives?
00:42:33.218,00:42:36.888,How do you know the heart beats beneath your chest?
00:42:37.013,00:42:41.767,"Most days, I don't."
00:42:37.013,00:42:49.608,"I'm just a simple Roman trying to make his way against the whim of the gods, the politicians, the miscreants, though often you can't tell one from another."
00:42:49.734,00:42:54.572,"But you, you are the most dangerous of animals."
00:42:54.697,00:42:57.158,The beast born of the heart.
00:42:57.283,00:42:59.327,What would you do to hold your wife again?
00:42:59.452,00:43:03.581,"To feel the warmth of her skin, to taste her lips?"
00:43:03.706,00:43:05.417,Would you kill?
00:43:05.542,00:43:08.378,Whoever stood between us.
00:43:08.503,00:43:12.006,How many men?
00:43:12.131,00:43:13.591,I would kill them all.
00:43:13.716,00:43:15.510,Then do it in the arena!
00:43:15.634,00:43:19.264,Fight for me and the honor of my forefathers!
00:43:19.389,00:43:23.518,Prove yourself.
00:43:19.389,00:43:26.312,"Climb to the pinnacle, gain your freedom and that of the woman you've lost."
00:43:26.438,00:43:32.235,I did not lose her.
00:43:32.360,00:43:36.822,A man must accept his fate.
00:43:38.699,00:43:44.080,Why would I place my fate in the hands of another Roman?
00:43:44.997,00:43:46.874,Because of what they hold.
00:43:50.878,00:43:53.047,Your wife's?
00:43:56.342,00:44:00.430,"Pass the final test, tonight."
00:44:00.555,00:44:05.143,Call me dominus.
00:44:16.988,00:44:18.906,The choice is yours.
00:45:02.783,00:45:04.494,BATIATUS: Cease!
00:45:05.995,00:45:10.208,Varro has stood to a draw!
00:45:21.511,00:45:25.806,Barca! Marcus! Positions!
00:45:30.645,00:45:33.272,GLADIATORS: Barca! Barca!
00:45:44.741,00:45:45.868,BATIATUS: Begin!
00:45:45.993,00:45:47.203,Raaaa!
00:46:00.174,00:46:01.593,That's disappointing.
00:46:01.718,00:46:03.969,Not every venture ends in climax.
00:46:04.095,00:46:06.472,A fact known well to every woman.
00:46:19.818,00:46:20.986,Crixus!
00:46:22.196,00:46:25.408,Spartacus! Positions!
00:46:36.753,00:46:39.380,GLADIATORS: Crixus! Crixus!
00:47:03.362,00:47:07.283,"One final lesson, before I send you to the afterlife."
00:47:18.753,00:47:19.962,Begin!
00:47:31.766,00:47:33.559,Fuck.
00:47:33.685,00:47:35.603,"Expensive and worthless, all in a measure."
00:47:36.979,00:47:39.064,Fight!
00:47:49.116,00:47:51.035,Tears!
00:47:53.954,00:47:56.873,The rabbit is fixed to piss himself!
00:48:19.063,00:48:21.106,BARCA: Skin the rabbit!
00:48:23.484,00:48:25.319,Ah! Oh!
00:48:35.329,00:48:37.081,Ahh! Ahhh!
00:48:39.250,00:48:41.252,Finish him!
00:48:44.255,00:48:46.090,Thracians.
00:48:56.058,00:48:58.143,Ahhh!
00:49:15.912,00:49:17.747,The lesson is well learned.
00:49:18.831,00:49:20.541,BATIATUS: Spartacus!
00:49:22.585,00:49:24.503,Cease.
00:49:30.050,00:49:33.304,You have passed the test.
00:49:44.064,00:49:47.610,Dominus.
00:49:47.735,00:49:53.783,BATIATUS: Your life now promises meaning.
00:49:53.908,00:49:57.411,Recite the Sacramentum Gladiatorum.
00:49:57.536,00:50:03.876,SPARTACUS: I commit my flesh.
00:50:04.000,00:50:11.091,"To the glory of this ludus, and the commands of my master, Batiatus."
00:50:12.969,00:50:20.810,"I swear to be burned, chained, beaten, or die by the sword."
00:50:20.935,00:50:24.062,In pursuit of honor in the arena.
00:50:36.784,00:50:39.244,Welcome to the brotherhood.
00:01:49.777,00:01:51.111,Spartacus!
00:01:52.529,00:01:53.948,You charge without thought.
00:01:55.449,00:01:58.827,A weakness an opponent could turn to advantage.
00:01:58.953,00:02:01.080,A difficult feat from his backside.
00:02:01.204,00:02:03.749,You speak without thought as well.
00:02:07.127,00:02:08.754,Another weakness.
00:02:11.715,00:02:13.341,Thracians.
00:02:13.467,00:02:15.761,"Always on their backs, with their legs spread."
00:02:15.886,00:02:18.263,Where they belong.
00:02:18.388,00:02:22.851,Forget everything you learned outside these walls.
00:02:22.977,00:02:25.353,For that is the world of men.
00:02:25.479,00:02:27.731,We are more!
00:02:27.856,00:02:29.775,We are Gladiators!
00:02:33.403,00:02:34.905,Study.
00:02:35.030,00:02:36.406,Train.
00:02:36.531,00:02:38.366,Bleed.
00:02:38.492,00:02:44.790,"And one day your name will be legend, spoken in hushed whispers of fear and awe."
00:02:44.915,00:02:48.877,"As the city speaks of Crixus, the champion of Capua!"
00:02:51.922,00:02:56.301,But his legend was not birthed in the arena.
00:02:56.426,00:02:58.470,It was given life here.
00:02:58.595,00:03:00.973,In this ludus.
00:03:01.098,00:03:03.350,Under the sting of my whip!
00:03:05.477,00:03:06.979,Attack!
00:04:13.503,00:04:15.672,Attend!
00:04:20.969,00:04:22.470,Vulcanalia?
00:04:22.596,00:04:24.848,A festival to ward off wildfires.
00:04:26.558,00:04:32.313,Dominus Batiatus has seen fit to fight twenty at this year's Vulcanalia.
00:04:32.439,00:04:36.026,His gift to the people of Capua!
00:04:36.151,00:04:38.528,Our lowest shall fight at dawn.
00:04:38.653,00:04:40.739,Eight pairs to follow.
00:04:40.864,00:04:46.411,After which your master will present his primus.
00:04:46.536,00:04:50.331,"Two of our finest, to meet in the arena!"
00:04:52.292,00:04:53.627,"Crixus, then?"
00:04:53.752,00:04:55.336,Crixus certainly.
00:04:56.337,00:04:58.548,And his opponent?
00:04:58.673,00:05:01.426,Against the Champion of Capua?
00:05:01.551,00:05:03.720,What would it matter?
00:05:15.523,00:05:25.742,"Twenty men, I pledge twenty men to fill the ranks of the Vulcanalia, my own coin to see each victor paid, what thanks do I get from the Magistrate?"
00:05:25.867,00:05:31.039,He fears he will be unable to attend our reception on the eve of the games due to pressing concerns!
00:05:31.165,00:05:32.624,Of what sort?
00:05:32.749,00:05:35.127,I hear rumor he dines with Solonius instead.
00:05:35.252,00:05:36.586,Solonius?
00:05:36.711,00:05:40.423,But he offers not one man for the Vulcanalia.
00:05:40.548,00:05:44.261,Yet his tongue still manages to find his way to the Magistrate's asshole.
00:05:45.386,00:05:46.847,Is that new?
00:05:46.972,00:05:49.975,"For the reception, yes."
00:05:50.100,00:05:52.936,The rising cost of this thing raises concern.
00:05:53.061,00:05:55.897,It raises opportunity.
00:05:56.023,00:05:56.815,I question not its import.
00:05:56.940,00:05:58.984,I question its scale.
00:05:59.109,00:06:02.445,This drought has stretched our resources thin and now without the attendance of the Magistrate...
00:06:02.570,00:06:07.701,"Darling, you must spend coins to receive coins."
00:06:07.826,00:06:09.953,My husband taught me that.
00:06:10.078,00:06:11.121,A wise man.
00:06:11.246,00:06:13.290,He has his moments.
00:06:13.414,00:06:15.583,And this will be one of them.
00:06:15.709,00:06:18.837,"You'll delight and astound, securing business for the year to come."
00:06:18.962,00:06:22.924,And perhaps even tempt Glaber's wife to take up the cause of patronage.
00:06:23.050,00:06:24.676,Ilithyia?
00:06:28.013,00:06:30.265,She returns absent him for the games.
00:06:30.389,00:06:32.351,She's acquiring quite a taste for them.
00:06:32.475,00:06:35.020,One which I shall nourish to advantage.
00:06:36.604,00:06:37.605,This new color suites you.
00:06:37.731,00:06:41.068,"Oh, shall I dye the rest to match?"
00:06:59.169,00:07:02.172,The bird would be better served in my bowl.
00:07:04.049,00:07:06.551,Odds the meal would be your last.
00:07:06.676,00:07:08.636,Barca?
00:07:08.762,00:07:11.514,He stands but tall.
00:07:11.639,00:07:13.725,He stands a legend.
00:07:15.143,00:07:22.150,"After Carthage suffered defeat by the Romans, they forced hundreds of his people to fight against each other in the arena."
00:07:23.735,00:07:27.697,"Half a day passed, and only two remained..."
00:07:32.994,00:07:35.455,Barca.
00:07:35.580,00:07:41.169,"And the chief of his people, the noble Mago."
00:07:44.089,00:07:47.050,Skill and the testament of years were his allies.
00:07:52.264,00:07:54.808,Strength and youth Barca's.
00:07:56.351,00:07:59.813,Mago fell to his knees...
00:08:04.443,00:08:08.029,And Barca became the Beast of Carthage.
00:08:10.240,00:08:12.909,He sent an old man on his way.
00:08:13.034,00:08:15.536,Mago was a warrior of fierce renown.
00:08:15.662,00:08:18.039,A chief upon a throne of blood.
00:08:21.668,00:08:24.338,"He was also Barca's father, as the story tells."
00:08:30.177,00:08:31.594,Is it true?
00:08:31.719,00:08:36.266,"In the world of the gladiator, a man's fame and glory constructs its own truth."
00:08:38.018,00:08:39.894,Fame and glory.
00:08:42.397,00:08:44.024,I seek neither.
00:08:45.317,00:08:47.735,"Coin, then."
00:08:47.861,00:08:49.529,Open the gates.
00:08:49.654,00:08:52.282,Have the guard ready.
00:08:54.575,00:08:56.244,A moment Dominus.
00:08:58.163,00:09:00.874,Ten paces.
00:09:00.999,00:09:02.834,Is there any news of my wife?
00:09:02.959,00:09:05.003,She was indeed sold to a Syrian merchant.
00:09:05.128,00:09:07.588,You found her?
00:09:07.714,00:09:09.174,I have cause to believe she sails upon the Orontes.
00:09:09.299,00:09:10.217,"To Damascus, then?"
00:09:10.342,00:09:12.511,Or perhaps Antioch?
00:09:12.635,00:09:17.098,"Do I appear a fucking arrow, my nose pointing towards your wife's dripping thighs!?!"
00:09:17.224,00:09:19.017,You press beyond position!
00:09:19.142,00:09:20.435,Dominus.
00:09:20.560,00:09:23.938,"The search continues, that's all you need to know Until then, fight, win."
00:09:24.064,00:09:27.859,The price of her freedom requires substantial sums on your part.
00:09:42.665,00:09:43.542,Show me something of note.
00:09:43.666,00:09:45.752,A moment.
00:09:45.877,00:09:47.379,My finest piece.
00:09:47.504,00:09:51.341,A flawless gem imported at great cost from the mines of Scythia.
00:10:04.187,00:10:06.356,price?
00:10:06.481,00:10:08.024,Thirty?
00:10:08.149,00:10:09.359,This piece.
00:10:09.484,00:10:11.694,Is it something that Ilithyia would favor?
00:10:11.819,00:10:13.821,It's the only piece I'd show her.
00:10:13.947,00:10:16.783,She has very refined tastes.
00:10:16.908,00:10:18.285,Twenty-five.
00:10:18.410,00:10:21.121,Twenty-nine.
00:10:21.246,00:10:24.832,Twenty-eight and I'll resist pitching you off the balcony.
00:10:24.958,00:10:26.251,"Twenty-eight, then."
00:10:26.376,00:10:28.962,Um.
00:10:29.087,00:10:30.464,Come along then.
00:10:36.219,00:10:39.722,Form two! Ready!
00:10:39.847,00:10:41.141,One.
00:10:44.102,00:10:46.563,"Form one, Ready!"
00:10:47.439,00:10:49.441,One...
00:10:52.110,00:10:53.320,Two..
00:10:55.447,00:10:56.864,Form two.
00:10:56.990,00:10:58.158,Ready!
00:11:03.538,00:11:04.872,Two.
00:11:08.543,00:11:09.961,Form Three!
00:11:12.755,00:11:14.757,Stand.
00:11:21.264,00:11:23.016,Spartacus!
00:11:23.141,00:11:24.934,Do you dream of the mines?
00:11:25.059,00:11:27.521,"My focus is on blood and battle, Doctore."
00:11:27.646,00:11:30.190,Yet your training proves you worthy of neither.
00:11:32.859,00:11:34.486,I am a Thracian.
00:11:34.611,00:11:36.070,It is in my blood.
00:11:36.196,00:11:37.531,Thrace.
00:11:43.036,00:11:45.163,A swamp of piss.
00:12:11.147,00:12:13.191,Kneel.
00:12:32.293,00:12:37.090,The lands from which you hail matters no longer.
00:12:37.215,00:12:42.095,The only thing that does is the sound of my voice...
00:12:42.220,00:12:45.265,and the sand beneath your feet.
00:12:51.354,00:12:54.524,You will learn to worship it.
00:12:54.649,00:12:56.192,Back to training.
00:12:58.236,00:13:00.363,The sand smells like Thrace.
00:13:02.781,00:13:05.410,Perhaps I should shit to complete the aroma.
00:13:08.455,00:13:11.625,You. You are summoned.
00:13:28.349,00:13:30.101,This drought seems never to end.
00:13:32.895,00:13:35.356,How do you fare?
00:13:35.482,00:13:36.857,Domina provides for me.
00:13:39.068,00:13:40.361,That's good.
00:13:40.487,00:13:41.780,Good.
00:13:41.904,00:13:43.281,How long have you served Domina?
00:13:46.159,00:13:48.202,All my life.
00:13:48.328,00:13:50.789,I was born in this ludus.
00:13:50.913,00:13:53.625,And recently come to blossom.
00:13:53.750,00:14:00.839,"I barely noticed till I, I saw you at the games with Domina three moons past, I fought Arnoch of Tarquinii."
00:14:00.965,00:14:03.551,Did you enjoy my victory?
00:14:03.677,00:14:06.721,I was pleased.
00:14:08.139,00:14:10.308,It's no easy task to sever a man's head.
00:14:11.934,00:14:14.521,You must find the right angle.
00:14:16.230,00:14:18.274,I do not favor the games.
00:14:21.235,00:14:29.035,"Well that is an odd bent, for a slave, at a gladiator school."
00:14:30.870,00:14:33.540,One not to be straightened.
00:14:34.791,00:14:36.042,I did not mean to insult.
00:14:36.167,00:14:37.544,Domina awaits.
00:15:05.946,00:15:09.492,You walk too slowly to my chambers.
00:15:09.617,00:15:13.329,I do not want to arouse the suspicions of my men as to my purpose.
00:15:14.748,00:15:17.208,"And what might that be, oh, Champion of Capua?"
00:15:19.502,00:15:21.170,Whatever Domina desires.
00:15:34.100,00:15:37.019,I brought this necklace for the reception...
00:15:37.144,00:15:39.230,Do you think its too much?
00:15:39.355,00:15:41.941,My blood rises.
00:15:42.066,00:15:45.194,But to give the necklace credit would be false.
00:15:45.319,00:15:46.946,And what quickens your pulse?
00:15:50.116,00:15:52.911,The touch of your lips.
00:15:53.035,00:15:55.496,Your breasts...
00:15:55.622,00:15:57.957,And all of the pleasures below...
00:16:03.254,00:16:06.883,I need your cock inside me.
00:16:07.007,00:16:08.968,And I need it in me now.
00:16:16.058,00:16:18.561,Never lose focus!
00:16:18.686,00:16:25.234,Not if Jupiter himself were to rip open the heavens and dangle his cock from the skies!
00:16:25.359,00:16:30.114,A gladiator's first distraction is his last.
00:16:30.239,00:16:32.951,Not all contests end in death...
00:16:35.202,00:16:37.121,A sign of surrender.
00:16:37.246,00:16:39.123,And shame.
00:16:42.293,00:16:45.338,The oath I swore to this place did not including begging.
00:16:49.216,00:16:51.177,He inquires as to the nuances of..
00:16:51.302,00:16:53.680,I need no lesson in submission.
00:16:56.098,00:16:59.059,You favor a different lesson?
00:16:59.185,00:17:02.021,"In obedience, perhaps?"
00:17:03.230,00:17:05.358,To the hole!
00:17:05.483,00:17:07.360,Both of you!
00:17:21.415,00:17:23.292,Perhaps I spoke out of turn.
00:17:23.417,00:17:25.545,Perhaps?
00:17:25.670,00:17:28.464,What I perceived as courage in you reveals itself foolishness.
00:17:28.589,00:17:31.300,To surrender in the arena...I cannot do.
00:17:31.425,00:17:32.969,I must have victory.
00:17:33.093,00:17:35.471,What happens when that is something you cannot provide?
00:17:38.265,00:17:40.476,"Silence, then."
00:17:40.601,00:17:43.437,"Next time you vex Doctore, you'll find my tongue of a similar fashion."
00:17:43.563,00:17:45.231,Your company here was not my intent.
00:17:45.356,00:17:49.485,"Yet here I stand beside you, my cock soaking in the same shit."
00:17:49.610,00:17:51.237,Apologies.
00:17:51.362,00:17:54.198,"Well, that's all?"
00:17:54.323,00:18:00.246,"No reason behind it, no glimpse into the fevered brain of what the fuck are you doing?"
00:18:00.371,00:18:02.373,I seek only to please Batiatus.
00:18:02.498,00:18:04.709,Pluto's asshole.
00:18:04.834,00:18:07.169,The answer has no balance with your actions.
00:18:09.672,00:18:11.173,He made a promise.
00:18:11.298,00:18:14.134,What could he offer a man who seeks neither fame nor glory.
00:18:15.261,00:18:17.388,My wife.
00:18:19.432,00:18:22.769,Taken from me when I was captured by the Romans.
00:18:22.894,00:18:25.354,"I prevail in the arena, and he will find her."
00:18:28.066,00:18:29.442,Is she worth it?
00:18:31.652,00:18:33.404,She's worth everything.
00:18:37.825,00:18:41.245,As is mine.
00:18:41.370,00:18:43.330,Two years here.
00:18:43.456,00:18:45.165,Pay my debts with the winnings.
00:18:45.291,00:18:47.418,Hold her in my arms again.
00:18:49.128,00:18:52.090,Perhaps the smell will have washed off by then.
00:18:58.763,00:19:00.347,What name do you call her?
00:19:00.473,00:19:02.683,Aurelia.
00:19:02.809,00:19:05.061,Yours?
00:19:05.185,00:19:06.562,Sura.
00:19:07.981,00:19:09.523,So.
00:19:09.649,00:19:12.568,Buried up to your balls in garbage.
00:19:12.693,00:19:16.572,This part of your plan to get Sura back?
00:19:22.787,00:19:25.456,You'd waste your ration cleaning a bit of cloth?
00:19:27.875,00:19:29.794,It bears meaning to me.
00:19:35.008,00:19:36.300,Gather.
00:19:39.053,00:19:41.931,Your master's hand has been at work.
00:19:42.056,00:19:45.434,The pairings of the Vulcanalia have been decided.
00:19:47.436,00:19:49.147,Crixus!
00:19:49.271,00:19:52.108,The unbeaten champion of Capua.
00:19:52.232,00:19:56.654,You will honor the house of Batiatus by fighting in his primus!
00:19:56.779,00:19:59.157,"And who will challenge me, Doctore?"
00:20:04.328,00:20:06.664,A man of skill and dedication.
00:20:06.789,00:20:12.962,"His ability, his hard work and his hunger shall be rewarded."
00:20:13.087,00:20:14.714,Gnaeus!
00:20:17.758,00:20:19.927,At last we meet brother.
00:20:20.761,00:20:22.513,Don't die to quickly.
00:20:25.599,00:20:27.727,I will fuck your corpse.
00:20:30.104,00:20:31.605,With what cock?
00:20:34.233,00:20:36.110,Ashur carries the remainder.
00:20:36.235,00:20:38.237,May the gods be with you!
00:20:40.740,00:20:41.615,One by one.
00:20:41.741,00:20:43.242,One by one you fucking cunts!
00:20:43.367,00:20:44.451,Batiatus himself handed me this list..
00:20:44.577,00:20:46.662,"Give it here, shit fuck."
00:20:50.624,00:20:51.792,Savages.
00:20:55.421,00:20:57.006,Fucking cock.
00:21:00.885,00:21:02.803,Let me see it.
00:21:02.929,00:21:05.098,Give it here.
00:21:05.223,00:21:07.558,Did you gain position?
00:21:07.683,00:21:10.019,As did you.
00:21:10.144,00:21:14.356,"We are set to fight each other, at the start of the games."
00:21:14.481,00:21:17.151,The first match?!
00:21:17.276,00:21:19.987,The slot of the meek and insubstantial!
00:21:20.113,00:21:21.280,We shall prove otherwise.
00:21:21.405,00:21:23.574,To what aim?
00:21:23.699,00:21:25.076,The victor's purse won't be more than half a coin.
00:21:25.201,00:21:26.786,So little?
00:21:26.911,00:21:27.954,Not enough for either of our causes.
00:21:28.079,00:21:29.413,And for the primus?
00:21:29.538,00:21:31.040,Considerably more.
00:21:31.165,00:21:34.543,"I already bested Crixus once, in the final test."
00:21:34.668,00:21:37.588,Now I must fight my way up through the dregs to face him again?
00:21:37.713,00:21:38.631,Dregs am I?
00:21:38.756,00:21:41.217,You know my meaning.
00:21:41.341,00:21:45.471,"If Batiatus hadn't stayed my hand, I would have parted his brains from his skull."
00:21:45.596,00:21:48.266,There is no love lost between myself and Crixus...
00:21:49.433,00:21:52.561,"but I caution, he's dangerous."
00:21:54.272,00:21:56.107,A reputation built on what?
00:21:56.232,00:21:59.235,Facing men such as Gnaeus and his little net?
00:21:59.359,00:22:02.488,Crixus forged his reputation against far worse.
00:22:05.741,00:22:07.952,The Gargan twins.
00:22:10.663,00:22:12.372,Decimus and Tiberius.
00:22:12.498,00:22:14.625,"Sons of a whore, raped by a jackal."
00:22:14.750,00:22:17.253,More beasts than men.
00:22:17.377,00:22:21.423,"They terrorized the eastern seaboard for many years, until their capture."
00:22:21.548,00:22:22.842,They were cast into the arena to die.
00:22:22.967,00:22:26.595,But instead flourished on meals of bone and blood...
00:22:33.936,00:22:36.856,"The bodies of stout men left in their wake, half devoured."
00:22:36.981,00:22:39.399,No one dared face them willingly.
00:22:39.525,00:22:40.651,Except for one...
00:22:40.776,00:22:44.238,Crixus! Champion of Capua!
00:22:44.362,00:22:48.284,The blood flowed.
00:22:48.408,00:22:50.703,And the demons fell beneath his sword...
00:23:14.894,00:23:16.436,The sons of a jackal?
00:23:17.938,00:23:19.690,So they say.
00:23:21.483,00:23:23.527,The story is a jest.
00:23:23.652,00:23:26.655,Like Crixus himself.
00:23:26.780,00:23:28.074,Did you hear this one?!
00:23:31.244,00:23:33.411,"One day, maybe you prove yourself."
00:23:33.537,00:23:37.124,"'Til then, you fight at dawn with the rest of the shitwhores."
00:24:03.067,00:24:05.527,I keep pace with the mighty Spartacus.
00:24:05.652,00:24:07.154,Still place my worth among the dregs?
00:24:08.406,00:24:09.365,I misspoke.
00:24:09.489,00:24:11.242,"A theme with you, is it not?"
00:24:11.367,00:24:13.119,I shall call you equal.
00:24:13.244,00:24:15.871,More will need to be earned.
00:24:15.996,00:24:17.790,It will be a good fight.
00:24:17.915,00:24:20.000,May the gods see us both survive.
00:24:20.126,00:24:22.378,There are many I would see dead in this place.
00:24:22.502,00:24:25.005,You are not among them though.
00:24:26.464,00:24:28.092,You may not have a choice.
00:24:28.217,00:24:30.094,There is always a choice.
00:24:38.852,00:24:41.147,That look gives me worry.
00:24:42.564,00:24:44.775,Words I've heard often from my wife.
00:24:50.488,00:24:53.784,"Your net's aim is remarkably true, Gnaeus."
00:24:56.162,00:24:59.039,You strike an impressive figure.
00:25:03.461,00:25:06.130,I long to see you in the arena.
00:25:06.255,00:25:09.800,"Among the men, there you are..."
00:25:09.925,00:25:12.052,with your fearsome net!
00:25:12.178,00:25:16.015,"Like a young, wet girl."
00:25:17.141,00:25:18.809,Fucking cunt!
00:25:28.944,00:25:31.280,The sun has made Gnaeus mad.
00:25:31.405,00:25:32.948,He charged like crazed goat.
00:25:33.073,00:25:34.825,I saw his eyes.
00:25:34.950,00:25:36.452,They were wild with thirst.
00:25:37.661,00:25:40.873,Barca!
00:25:40.998,00:25:43.750,Tend to Gnaeus.
00:25:43.876,00:25:45.961,Back to work!
00:26:07.607,00:26:08.817,Ashur.
00:26:11.778,00:26:13.697,There is something I want you to get for me.
00:26:13.822,00:26:17.784,"Whatever your needs, Ashur provides."
00:26:19.119,00:26:22.873,"Follow me, away from prying ears..."
00:26:44.353,00:26:46.939,I must make a point to stop standing beside you.
00:26:48.774,00:26:51.693,Gnaeus was of an unsteady nature.
00:26:51.818,00:26:55.739,"If your intent was to claim Gnaeus' berth in the primus, you're a fool."
00:26:55.864,00:26:58.492,He served five years before he was afforded the privilege.
00:27:01.661,00:27:04.081,Sura cannot afford years.
00:27:04.206,00:27:08.919,"Nor your death, which is surely your station if you face Crixus in the arena."
00:27:12.089,00:27:13.299,Your public has arrived.
00:27:13.424,00:27:15.801,Dress quickly.
00:27:15.926,00:27:17.177,The reception begins.
00:27:29.856,00:27:31.191,Crixus!
00:27:31.317,00:27:34.403,Let good Mercato have a closer look at your sword.
00:27:34.528,00:27:38.449,Dominus.
00:27:38.574,00:27:43.745,The very blade used to strike down Tiberius and Decimus.
00:27:45.623,00:27:50.794,"If you were to bestow Capua with the gift of a munus, what better means than securing Crixus?"
00:27:50.919,00:27:55.591,Along with a dozen or so of my other offerings to round out the proceedings?
00:27:55.715,00:27:58.177,I have been contemplating games in honor of my good friend..
00:27:58.302,00:27:59.719,Ashur!
00:27:59.845,00:28:01.263,Good Mercato has set his mind to a day of games.
00:28:01.388,00:28:03.765,Let us see his order well filled...shall we?
00:28:06.352,00:28:10.147,"Ahh, the dust and the heat, it worsens by the hour."
00:28:10.272,00:28:12.650,I'd yet be in Rome if it weren't for the games.
00:28:12.774,00:28:14.067,You must promise to visit while I'm here.
00:28:14.193,00:28:16.612,My father's villa is beyond depressing.
00:28:16.736,00:28:18.572,It's unfortunate your husband couldn't join you.
00:28:18.696,00:28:20.407,How fares the Legatus?
00:28:20.533,00:28:22.409,In a mood.
00:28:22.535,00:28:25.579,"Since his return from Thrace, the Senate has become his mistress."
00:28:25.703,00:28:27.914,Her demands on him are boundless.
00:28:28.040,00:28:29.916,Men and their ambitions.
00:28:35.297,00:28:38.800,That necklace.
00:28:38.925,00:28:39.801,Oh this?
00:28:39.926,00:28:42.221,It's a trinket.
00:28:42.346,00:28:44.473,It calls to mind a piece I had from Ramel one season.
00:28:44.598,00:28:46.766,When emerald was still the fashion.
00:28:48.435,00:28:51.271,I hear it's coming back around.
00:28:51.397,00:28:54.941,"Oh. Perhaps I'll root mine out, then."
00:28:55.067,00:28:57.570,"Friends, old and new!"
00:28:57.695,00:29:02.491,Gratitude for honoring the storied ludus of Batiatus with your presence this eve.
00:29:02.616,00:29:07.329,Tomorrow's Vulcanalia promises many glories in the arena.
00:29:07.454,00:29:09.331,But tonight...
00:29:09.456,00:29:13.085,May I present to you the finest gladiators in all the Republic!
00:29:19.466,00:29:20.676,Look!
00:29:20.800,00:29:22.469,Touch!
00:29:22.595,00:29:25.598,Feel the quality of the stock!
00:29:25.723,00:29:28.434,Place your orders for any of the men you covet!
00:29:30.394,00:29:33.564,"Come! Don't be bashful, they won't bite!"
00:29:33.689,00:29:36.233,"And if they do, a ten percent discount!"
00:29:45.158,00:29:48.287,"The crowd fancies our Thracian, don't they?"
00:29:48.412,00:29:51.582,"A curiosity, born of his fortune against Solonius' men."
00:29:51.707,00:29:54.501,Better curiosity than indifference!
00:29:54.627,00:29:59.298,Perhaps we could fuel this interest into a conflagration of coin...
00:29:59.423,00:30:04.219,"With Gnaeus of questionable skull, what make you of Spartacus as replacement in our primus?"
00:30:04.344,00:30:08.390,"With respect Dominus, the public seeks an honorable fight."
00:30:08.515,00:30:10.183,Spartacus is yet the animal.
00:30:12.060,00:30:13.979,"Um, well I'll think on."
00:30:14.104,00:30:14.896,"One day, though."
00:30:15.021,00:30:17.816,A contest to be promoted...
00:30:22.321,00:30:23.822,A moment alone.
00:30:23.947,00:30:27.033,"A rarity for a man with such an adoring public, huh?"
00:30:30.287,00:30:31.871,"To business, then."
00:30:31.997,00:30:37.628,"A difficult task on short notice, yet-- carried to completion."
00:30:45.678,00:30:47.763,Cock fucker.
00:30:47.887,00:30:52.142,"Your Gaul is of a fine cut, is he not?"
00:30:52.267,00:30:54.853,None finer in all the Republic.
00:30:54.978,00:30:57.189,Such a man...
00:31:01.943,00:31:05.238,I tremble to see him again at the arena...
00:31:05.364,00:31:07.199,As do we all.
00:31:19.712,00:31:21.630,The Thracian yet lives?
00:31:24.174,00:31:26.885,For now.
00:31:27.010,00:31:30.556,Is there nothing more of interest to see?
00:31:30.681,00:31:35.018,"Well my husband will shortly announce his primus, and there's is ample wine..."
00:31:35.143,00:31:37.896,I fear it already beckons my sleep.
00:31:41.191,00:31:44.528,Perhaps I'd best take leave.
00:31:44.653,00:31:47.030,Course.
00:31:47.155,00:31:54.663,"Of course there is one thing that I thought you might enjoy, its something of a much more physical nature."
00:31:54.788,00:31:57.416,You.
00:31:57.541,00:31:58.834,Come with me.
00:32:27.070,00:32:30.198,Five denarii says he doesn't last another twenty strokes.
00:32:36.538,00:32:40.041,I've never seen a gladiator fuck before....
00:32:42.085,00:32:43.754,Look at the way he rams her!
00:32:47.173,00:32:49.008,Like an enraged bull!
00:32:49.134,00:32:54.139,A gladiator's virtues extends well beyond the sands of the arena.
00:32:54.264,00:32:57.476,"As lovers, they are said to be ravenous beasts."
00:32:57.601,00:32:59.060,You can touch.
00:33:03.565,00:33:06.693,"Oh, forgive me, Aurelia."
00:33:06.819,00:33:09.488,They provide unimaginable pleasures..
00:33:23.418,00:33:25.921,Can he do it again?
00:33:26.045,00:33:27.380,Make him do it again!
00:33:30.300,00:33:32.344,Proceed.
00:33:37.307,00:33:38.475,"So, we are in agreement."
00:33:38.600,00:33:39.726,Rabanus will meet Crixus.
00:33:39.852,00:33:42.562,Move Hamilcar up to fill the void.
00:33:49.987,00:33:53.281,I overheard Batiatus and Doctore in conference.
00:33:53.406,00:33:56.034,The primus their intent.
00:33:56.159,00:33:58.495,The Sardinian is to face Crixus.
00:34:00.956,00:34:03.000,The news does not balance my cause.
00:34:09.631,00:34:12.300,"Whatever your thoughts, cast them out."
00:34:13.468,00:34:15.595,Good citizens!
00:34:15.721,00:34:17.180,You've enjoyed my food!
00:34:17.305,00:34:19.098,My wine!
00:34:19.224,00:34:22.185,The aphrodisiac presence of my beautiful wife!
00:34:22.310,00:34:25.271,Now marvel at the announcing of tomorrow's primus!
00:34:25.397,00:34:32.362,"Crixus, the Champion of Capua, will stride across the sands and face.."
00:34:37.910,00:34:39.578,Spartacus!
00:34:40.370,00:34:42.330,No! Let them fight!
00:34:54.092,00:34:55.385,Enough!
00:35:01.975,00:35:03.393,I will take your fucking heart!
00:35:03.518,00:35:05.228,"Come and take it, coward!"
00:35:14.029,00:35:16.197,Haa!
00:35:16.322,00:35:20.118,"See their hatred, burning beyond control!"
00:35:20.243,00:35:21.244,Huh?
00:35:21.369,00:35:22.788,This was merely a taste!
00:35:22.913,00:35:28.167,Tomorrow they will settle this grudge in the arena!
00:35:33.381,00:35:37.052,"Crixus, the undefeated!"
00:35:37.176,00:35:43.100,"Spartacus, the dog who defies death!"
00:35:43.224,00:35:46.269,A fight for the ages!
00:35:46.394,00:35:48.605,Glory to Capua!
00:35:48.730,00:35:50.107,Glory to Rome!
00:36:07.165,00:36:10.335,"The reception nearly ruined, and what is his punishment?"
00:36:10.460,00:36:11.837,The fucking primus!
00:36:11.962,00:36:14.673,You heard the crowd.
00:36:14.798,00:36:17.884,The Thracian has yet to stand a single match as gladiator.
00:36:18.010,00:36:20.303,Why leap him ahead of all others to face Crixus?
00:36:20.428,00:36:22.806,Because of what he possesses.
00:36:24.975,00:36:26.309,They stroke a rabid dog.
00:36:26.434,00:36:27.352,Spartacus has struck a chord.
00:36:27.477,00:36:29.771,I intend to maximize its profit.
00:36:31.189,00:36:36.486,"He's unpredictable, he has no regard for rules or for honor and if something happens to Crixus..."
00:36:36.611,00:36:38.404,He poses no threat to Crixus.
00:36:38.530,00:36:40.198,He is but a novelty.
00:36:40.323,00:36:41.825,To be used and discarded after a purpose.
00:36:41.950,00:36:44.619,Fucking god's cock is there no wine left!
00:36:46.204,00:36:49.875,"Well, what are you standing there for, go and get some fucking wine."
00:37:04.097,00:37:05.598,Apologies.
00:37:05.724,00:37:07.059,I did not mean to startle.
00:37:13.398,00:37:17.819,"When we spoke last, I meant no offense."
00:37:17.944,00:37:21.073,I am practiced with sword not words.
00:37:21.198,00:37:23.324,If Domina discovers I dropped the last jug...
00:37:23.449,00:37:24.951,Hand me the pieces.
00:37:25.077,00:37:26.494,I'll see them over the cliff.
00:37:40.425,00:37:41.801,Wait.
00:37:47.224,00:37:51.644,Perhaps this gift will explain where words fail.
00:37:54.480,00:37:56.441,Please.
00:38:27.639,00:38:30.391,I'm trying to decide.
00:38:30.516,00:38:32.435,Upon what?
00:38:32.560,00:38:35.647,Congratulations or condolences.
00:38:35.772,00:38:42.821,"You may have bested Crixus once by tripping him with that bit of cloth, but to face him in the arena..."
00:38:42.946,00:38:46.158,I believe his reputation inflated.
00:38:46.283,00:38:49.286,Tomorrow I shall prove it so.
00:38:49.410,00:38:52.580,Next he'll boast he can defeat Theokoles himself.
00:38:52.705,00:38:54.415,Perhaps.
00:38:54.540,00:38:56.126,If I knew the man.
00:38:58.044,00:38:59.879,Theokoles.
00:39:00.005,00:39:01.339,The Shadow of Death.
00:39:01.464,00:39:06.385,"He speaks so brazenly of the arena, he knows nothing of its history."
00:39:09.139,00:39:11.766,"Theokoles is no man, Thracian."
00:39:14.019,00:39:16.229,He is something else entirely...
00:39:18.023,00:39:21.567,They say he stand over ten feet tall.
00:39:21.693,00:39:25.280,The very ground trembles at his feet.
00:39:25.404,00:39:29.034,His shadow eclipsing the sun.
00:39:29.159,00:39:33.412,Most men fall dead at the sight of the giant.
00:39:33.538,00:39:36.457,They are the fortunate ones.
00:39:44.757,00:39:48.594,My father tells of a munus in which the Shadow fought over a hundred men.
00:39:51.223,00:39:52.807,Not one survived.
00:39:56.061,00:39:59.564,"A tale, to frighten children."
00:40:01.274,00:40:04.443,Theokoles is no legend.
00:40:04.569,00:40:09.448,"Before he retired from the arena, only one man ever faced him and lived."
00:40:09.574,00:40:14.120,"And he breathes among us, his whip ever at our backs."
00:40:16.248,00:40:19.417,Now is not the hour for idle talk.
00:40:19.542,00:40:23.380,Tomorrow you step into the arena.
00:40:23.504,00:40:26.549,Many for the first time.
00:40:26.674,00:40:29.010,"For some, perhaps the last."
00:40:48.529,00:40:50.698,They cheer for blood.
00:40:50.823,00:40:52.033,And they shall have it.
00:40:56.746,00:40:59.665,"May the gods bring you fortune, as they did me this morning."
00:41:02.794,00:41:04.421,Sura believed in the gods.
00:41:07.090,00:41:13.763,"And when the Romans took her, not one descended from the heavens to intervene."
00:41:16.182,00:41:19.102,I shall correct their mistake presently.
00:41:36.619,00:41:38.537,"Yes, a fine showing all around."
00:41:38.663,00:41:40.790,"You honor our fair city, Batiatus."
00:41:40.915,00:41:42.792,"The honor is mine, Magistrate."
00:41:42.917,00:41:47.005,"Truth told, I feared the event would pass without anything of note this year."
00:41:47.130,00:41:51.301,Its very difficult to procure men of worth for these minor games.
00:41:51.426,00:41:54.971,Good Solonius was already taken with loftier engagements.
00:41:55.096,00:41:57.474,Perhaps Solonius will be available next year.
00:41:57.598,00:42:00.185,One can but pray.
00:42:03.480,00:42:06.483,Perhaps I was wrong to return absent the rain.
00:42:08.693,00:42:11.112,Some water perhaps.
00:42:11.237,00:42:12.947,Or maybe some wine.
00:42:13.072,00:42:16.617,"Uhh, the thought churns the stomach."
00:42:22.790,00:42:23.833,Too much?
00:42:23.958,00:42:26.544,"Of wine, definitely."
00:42:26.669,00:42:29.922,Of other interests...
00:42:30.048,00:42:32.758,I think the surface barely scratched.
00:42:32.884,00:42:37.972,"Some water then, to slake your current thirst."
00:42:45.813,00:42:46.981,"Here we go, then."
00:42:49.901,00:42:51.736,Good citizens of Capua!
00:42:51.861,00:42:59.285,It is my great honor to introduce to you the primus of Quintus Lentulus Batiatus!
00:43:11.714,00:43:13.883,Enter Thraex!
00:43:20.432,00:43:22.767,Behold Spartacus!
00:43:22.892,00:43:25.895,Spartacus!
00:43:26.020,00:43:28.565,Spartacus!
00:43:28.689,00:43:35.405,Renowned for his magnificent victory at the games of Senator Albinius!
00:43:35.530,00:43:39.909,Where he single handedly slaughtered four of Solonius' gladiators!
00:43:40.034,00:43:41.702,FOUR!
00:43:46.082,00:43:47.875,Enter Murmillo!
00:44:01.514,00:44:04.976,The marvel before you needs no introduction!
00:44:06.269,00:44:08.271,He's known by his sword!
00:44:08.396,00:44:10.648,By his shield! By his glory!
00:44:16.446,00:44:18.531,Crixus!
00:44:18.656,00:44:20.992,The Champion of Capua!
00:44:28.207,00:44:30.918,"Finally, Crixus!"
00:44:32.629,00:44:35.423,Look how his form catches the sun!
00:44:37.758,00:44:40.178,Capua!
00:44:50.313,00:44:54.150,Capua!
00:44:56.319,00:45:21.636,In honor of the name Batiatus and the sacred Vulcanalia-- You had not yet finished the oration and yet the Thracian attacks!?!
00:45:21.760,00:45:23.638,Was that not supposed to happen?
00:45:23.762,00:45:25.848,"No, it was not."
00:45:25.973,00:45:28.017,How exciting...
00:46:28.703,00:46:30.705,Is that all the Thracian is capable of?
00:46:30.829,00:46:36.001,"After what he did against Solonius' men, I had hoped for more."
00:47:42.985,00:47:45.279,Capua!
00:47:46.739,00:47:48.616,Shall I begin!?!
00:49:28.800,00:49:30.967,"Now you die, Thracian."
00:49:32.094,00:49:33.638,CROWD: Kill. Kill.
00:49:33.763,00:49:36.098,"Kill, Kill."
00:49:39.059,00:49:41.353,"Kill, kill!"
00:50:49.213,00:50:52.550,Spartacus fought well!
00:50:57.388,00:50:59.807,Let him live to fight another day!
00:51:14.363,00:51:17.533,A sour bite to end the meal.
00:51:17.658,00:51:19.577,Apologies.
00:51:19.702,00:51:22.538,Yet Spartacus was of some cost to me...
00:51:24.707,00:51:26.542,You've already lost the crowd.
00:51:33.799,00:51:35.384,He lives?
00:51:37.720,00:51:39.597,How disappointing.
00:52:18.094,00:52:20.721,is well earned.
00:52:20.846,00:52:23.432,My blade could find no weakness.
00:52:28.646,00:52:33.275,And yet-- it was there.
00:52:33.400,00:52:38.572,At least ten points where you could have seized advantage.
00:52:39.531,00:52:41.492,You needed more training.
00:52:45.245,00:52:47.706,I shall train harder then.
00:52:49.249,00:52:52.711,No.
00:52:52.837,00:52:54.505,It is too late for such things.
00:00:48.465,00:00:49.466,DO YOU THINK ME A FOOL?
00:00:49.591,00:00:50.801,"NO, DOMINUS."
00:00:50.926,00:00:52.260,YET YOU DISHONOR ME.
00:00:52.386,00:00:54.805,"AN AGREEMENT REACHED, AN OATH SWORN!"
00:00:54.930,00:00:58.225,YOU WOULD SUBMIT TO GLADIATORIAL TRAINING.
00:00:58.350,00:01:01.854,"CALL ME MASTER, ATTEND TO THE RULES!"
00:01:01.979,00:01:08.068,"IN RETURN, I WOULD SEARCH FOR YOUR PRECIOUS WIFE!"
00:01:08.193,00:01:10.905,BUT YOUR HASTE BESTED YOU.
00:01:11.030,00:01:15.283,"DEFYING DOCTORE, MANEUVERING TO USURP GNAEUS TO FACE CRIXUS IN THE ARENA."
00:01:15.409,00:01:17.912,YOUR FIRST CONTEST!
00:01:18.037,00:01:19.079,WITH CRIXUS!
00:01:19.204,00:01:21.040,THE CHAMPION OF FUCKING CAPUA!
00:01:21.164,00:01:23.042,I REALIZE THE MISTAKE IN IT.
00:01:23.166,00:01:24.543,MISTAKE?
00:01:28.422,00:01:31.466,"FUCK, YOU HAD THE CROWD!"
00:01:33.134,00:01:37.305,YOU SURVIVED EXECUTION AGAINST FOUR OF SOLONIUS' MEN!
00:01:37.431,00:01:39.349,YOUR NAME WAS ON EVERY TONGUE!
00:01:39.474,00:01:43.938,"NOW AFTER YOUR SHOWING WITH CRIXUS, IT'S SPOKEN OF WITH CONTEMPT!"
00:01:44.063,00:01:49.026,YOUR LITTLE MISTAKE MAKES REUNION WITH YOUR WIFE PROBLEMATIC.
00:01:49.150,00:01:51.361,YOU HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF HER?
00:01:54.615,00:01:58.660,THE SYRIAN GLABE I SOLD HER TO WAS LAST NOTED HEADING NORTH.
00:01:58.786,00:02:00.412,WE'VE YET TO DIVINE THEIR DESTINATION.
00:02:00.537,00:02:03.832,YOU MUST KEEP SEARCHING FOR HER.
00:02:03.958,00:02:09.088,YOU SHIT ON HONORABLE AGREEMENTS AND PRESS FOR FRESH DEMANDS?
00:02:09.212,00:02:13.216,"TELL ME, THRACIAN, HOW WILL YOU PAY FOR HER RELEASE IF FOUND?"
00:02:13.341,00:02:15.427,HER TRANSPORT?
00:02:15.552,00:02:17.304,DO YOU SHOOT MAGIC COINS OUT OF YOUR ASS?
00:02:17.429,00:02:19.514,"IF SO, SQUAT AND PRODUCE!"
00:02:19.640,00:02:24.227,"I SHALL FIGHT IN THE ARENA, MY WINNINGS-- NO ONE WISHES TO SEE YOU FIGHT!"
00:02:25.854,00:02:28.440,"THE CROWD'S FAVOR, LIKE THE WIND, IS FLEETING."
00:02:28.565,00:02:31.318,THEIR INTEREST IN YOU HAS BLOWN OUT.
00:02:37.240,00:02:39.367,THERE MUST BE A WAY FOR ME TO FIGHT.
00:02:39.493,00:02:41.286,ONLY ONE.
00:02:41.411,00:02:44.665,"IN A PLACE WHERE YOU NEEDN'T FOLLOW RULES, BECAUSE NONE EXIST."
00:02:48.669,00:02:51.505,THE PITS OF THE UNDERWORLD.
00:02:51.630,00:02:55.300,"FIGHT THERE AND SURVIVE, AND YOU WILL FILL BOTH OUR HANDS WITH COIN."
00:02:55.425,00:03:00.514,AND-- YOU MAY YET FEEL YOUR WIFE'S TOUCH AGAIN.
00:03:21.785,00:03:23.202,THRACIAN BITCH.
00:03:23.328,00:03:24.538,BARCA! RELEASE!
00:03:29.043,00:03:31.128,I THINK YOUR WIFE'S BINDING SHOULD REMAIN HERE.
00:03:31.252,00:03:33.088,"WHERE YOU'RE GOING, YOU MIGHT LOSE IT."
00:03:33.212,00:03:34.589,ALONG WITH AN ARM.
00:03:46.267,00:03:47.477,FINISH PREPARING HIM.
00:03:57.362,00:03:58.947,"A WORD, DOMINUS?"
00:03:59.073,00:04:00.323,IF HASTENED.
00:04:00.448,00:04:03.493,THE WALLS SPREAD RUMOR OF THE PITS.
00:04:03.618,00:04:05.204,YOU FIND OBJECTION TO THIS COURSE?
00:04:05.328,00:04:08.498,"IT IS A PLACE OF PAIN AND SUFFERING, BEASTS DYING WITHOUT HONOR."
00:04:08.623,00:04:12.127,YOUR FATHER WOULD NEVER HAVE-- THE DECISION IS MADE!
00:04:12.252,00:04:14.922,"IF A BEAST CANNOT BE TAMED, IT MUST BE UNLEASHED."
00:04:23.513,00:04:27.935,"IF THE RAINS EVER RETURN, I SHALL SOAK IN A BATH FOR A WEEK."

00:04:36.902,00:04:39.113,"ONLY A FEW DROPS REMAIN, DOMINA."
00:04:40.697,00:04:43.117,I SHALL SAVE THEM FOR JUPITER.
00:04:44.284,00:04:47.621,I WILL DOUSE HIS ALTAR AND PRAY THAT THE SCENT SPARKS A DELUGE.
00:04:49.289,00:04:51.666,HAVE YOU SEEN MY DAGGER?
00:04:51.792,00:04:53.293,WHAT PURPOSE REQUIRES IT?
00:04:53.418,00:04:56.630,I'VE DIVINED AN ADDITIONAL STREAM OF REVENUE.
00:04:58.257,00:05:00.634,ONE THAT WILL PROVIDE US A PROPER BATH.
00:05:01.927,00:05:06.431,"AND THIS STREAM, IT FLOWS FROM WHAT ORIFICE?"
00:05:08.225,00:05:09.559,THE PITS.

00:05:18.443,00:05:21.488,"OF THE NEW RECRUITS, VARRO IS THE ONLY MAN OF PROMISE."
00:05:21.613,00:05:23.949,SPARTACUS AND KERZA PROVE WORTHLESS IN THE ARENA.
00:05:24.074,00:05:26.701,SO I FIGHT THEM BOTH TONIGHT WHERE THEY MAY YET FILL OUR PURSE.
00:05:26.827,00:05:28.120,QUINTUS.
00:05:29.412,00:05:31.539,DISPATCHING THE THRACIAN BRINGS ME RELIEF.
00:05:31.665,00:05:34.709,YOU DESCENDING INTO THE PITS DOES NOT.
00:05:34.835,00:05:36.795,"IT STAINS THE NAME, AND THREATENS THE BODY."
00:05:36.920,00:05:38.255,MY BODY WILL BE WELL PROTECTED.
00:05:38.379,00:05:43.342,"BARCA LOOMS OVER IT, READY TO BREAK BONE AT THE SLIGHTEST PROVOCATION."
00:05:43.468,00:05:48.265,"INFORM BARCA THAT IF YOU RETURN SCATHED, I'LL HAVE HIS COCK IN A JAR."
00:05:48.389,00:05:50.809,THE MESSAGE WILL BE DUTIFULLY DELIVERED.
00:05:53.394,00:05:55.147,GIVE CRIXUS A WOMAN TONIGHT.
00:05:55.272,00:05:59.442,MOTIVATION TO THE OTHERS THAT SUCCESS BRINGS DECORATION IN MANY FORMS.
00:06:00.777,00:06:02.696,I'LL SEE HIM WELL SATISFIED.
00:06:26.553,00:06:28.138,KEEP MOVING YOU FUCK!
00:06:30.307,00:06:32.559,WHERE DO THEY TAKE HIM?
00:06:36.395,00:06:39.482,"TO THE UNDERWORLD, WHERE HE BELONGS."
00:06:40.359,00:06:41.860,BACK TO TRAINING!
00:06:48.449,00:06:52.579,TELL ME I DON'T LOOK LIKE I HAVE BEEN SHIT FROM A BOAR'S ASS LIKE YOU.
00:06:56.457,00:06:58.960,I AM NOT DYING IN THE PITS.
00:07:04.091,00:07:06.593,I WILL FUCK THEM ALL!

00:08:35.640,00:08:37.558,I HAD EXPECTED THEM LAID EARLIER.
00:08:37.684,00:08:44.483,"OUR AGREEMENT CALLS FOR REPAYMENT OF YOUR DEBT PLUS THIRTY PERCENT, TO BE DELIVERED THE DAY AFTER THE GAMES OF THE VULCANALIA."
00:08:44.607,00:08:48.278,"YET I FIND YOU HERE, WAGERING COIN STILL OWED."
00:08:48.403,00:08:50.655,"YOU'LL BE FIRST TO RECEIVE WHAT IS DUE, I ASSURE YOU."
00:08:50.780,00:08:55.285,"WORDS SPEWED BY JANUS, FROM BOTH SIDES OF HIS FACE."
00:08:56.453,00:08:59.247,YOU'LL BE REPAID SOON ENOUGH.
00:08:59.373,00:09:02.000,UNLESS YOU'D CARE TO PRESS THE MATTER?
00:09:04.627,00:09:07.381,AT YOUR CONVENIENCE THEN.
00:09:07.506,00:09:11.718,"UNTIL SUCH TIME, THE POINTS STILL ACCRUE."
00:09:17.724,00:09:19.100,ASS EATING SHIT.
00:09:19.226,00:09:21.811,"SPEAK TO ME SUCH AGAIN, I WILL ACCRUE YOUR FUCKING HEAD."
00:09:25.565,00:09:28.068,"IXION, VICTOR!"
00:09:31.863,00:09:34.241,YOU WANT TO FACE ME?
00:10:06.398,00:10:09.526,"MAY THE GODS FARE YOU BETTER, THRACIAN."
00:10:09.650,00:10:11.278,FOR BOTH OUR SAKES.
00:10:17.617,00:10:20.703,YOUR NECK IS BARE OF MY GIFT.
00:10:20.828,00:10:22.581,IT IS.
00:10:22.705,00:10:24.374,"YOU DID NOT FAVOR IT, THEN?"
00:10:24.499,00:10:25.666,THE NECKLACE I GAVE YOU?
00:10:25.792,00:10:27.210,LOWER YOUR VOICE.
00:10:29.254,00:10:32.466,"YOUR GIFT, I CANNOT ACCEPT IT."

00:10:37.845,00:10:41.475,"YOU MUST UNDERSTAND, IF DOMINA-- YOU'VE MADE YOUR INTENTION CLEAR."
00:10:55.572,00:10:57.324,DOES IT EXCITE YOU?
00:10:58.699,00:11:03.413,TO KNOW THAT YOUR VERY FOOTSTEPS MOISTEN MY THIGHS?
00:11:03.538,00:11:05.915,I WOULD HAVE THEM DRIPPING EVEN MORE.
00:11:08.960,00:11:11.296,WELL DRAW CLOSER AND MAKE IT SO.
00:11:18.677,00:11:20.013,WHAT ARE YOU CLUTCHING?

00:11:51.919,00:11:53.796,DOES IT PLEASE YOU?
00:11:58.717,00:12:00.428,YES.

00:12:57.860,00:13:00.488,"BEHOLD, MYRMEX!"
00:13:03.658,00:13:06.578,"BEHOLD, SPARTACUS!"
00:13:10.582,00:13:12.833,THE CROWD DOES NOT SEEM TO FAVOR HIM.
00:13:12.959,00:13:15.629,"WHY WOULD THEY, AFTER HIS SHOWING IN THE ARENA?"
00:13:15.754,00:13:18.923,WHAT WEAPONS SHALL THE GODS BLESS THEM WITH?
00:13:19.048,00:13:23.511,OR CURSE THEM WITH EMPTY HANDS!
00:13:23.637,00:13:25.096,CHOOSE YOUR FATE!
00:13:32.437,00:13:35.814,MYRMEX DRAWS SPHAIRAI!
00:14:01.591,00:14:03.134,MYRMEX HAS THE ADVANTAGE.
00:14:04.636,00:14:06.220,THANK YOU FOR THE FUCKING OBVIOUS.
00:14:06.346,00:14:09.890,WE HAVE BUT A SINGLE RULE!
00:14:10.016,00:14:11.351,ONLY ONE SURVIVES!
00:14:12.352,00:14:18.107,"MONGREL ON MONGREL, TILL CHARON ARRIVES!"
00:14:20.234,00:14:21.944,WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE ODDS?
00:14:22.069,00:14:24.197,FOUR TO ONE AGAINST OUR MAN.
00:14:24.322,00:14:26.616,MAYBE FIVE.
00:14:26.741,00:14:28.451,PLACE TEN DENARII ON SPARTACUS.
00:14:30.244,00:14:31.538,DOMINUS.
00:15:15.415,00:15:16.999,DO SOMETHING!
00:15:50.199,00:15:52.869,SPARTACUS! VICTOR!
00:15:56.790,00:16:00.209,"GIVE HIM A MOMENT'S REST, THEN FIGHT HIM AGAIN."
00:16:23.065,00:16:24.358,YOU'RE HURT.
00:16:26.527,00:16:28.112,I'M ALL RIGHT.
00:16:29.196,00:16:32.241,YOU PUSH YOURSELF TOO FAR.
00:16:32.366,00:16:34.034,AND YET I LIVE.
00:16:34.160,00:16:36.078,FOR HOW LONG?
00:16:36.203,00:16:38.832,AS LONG AS IT TAKES.
00:16:38.957,00:16:40.416,THEN KILL THEM ALL.
00:16:56.140,00:16:59.143,DO YOU PLAN TO RETURN TO THE PITS?
00:16:59.268,00:17:05.191,THEY FILL OUR HANDS WITH COIN-- WITH YET MORE TO BE MINED.
00:17:06.776,00:17:08.820,AND WHAT WHEN THE SHAFT CAVES IN ON YOU?
00:17:08.945,00:17:11.322,WHAT THEN?
00:17:11.447,00:17:14.993,"YOU KNOW THE LAW, WITHOUT AN HEIR I'D BE FORCED TO MARRY ANOTHER."
00:17:15.117,00:17:16.828,IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
00:17:16.953,00:17:20.331,I WANT EVERYTHING!
00:17:23.543,00:17:25.294,YET CAN AFFORD NOTHING.
00:17:28.047,00:17:30.424,"MY CONCERNS ONLY WITH YOU, QUINTUS."
00:17:33.093,00:17:37.557,"IF YOU'RE LOST, MY REASON FOR BREATH WOULD SURELY FOLLOW."
00:17:37.682,00:17:41.769,"I REMAIN FIRMLY ROOTED, BANISH IT FROM THOUGHT."
00:17:41.895,00:17:43.563,"WHEN SPARTACUS ENDS, SO DOES MY TIME IN THE PITS."
00:17:43.688,00:17:46.357,"TILL THEN, HIS VICTORIES SWELL OUR PURSE."
00:17:50.444,00:17:53.447,WHICH YOU DEFLATE WITH NEW PURCHASES.
00:17:53.573,00:17:55.449,THIS SIMPLE THING?
00:17:55.575,00:17:58.202,ITS REDISCOVERY TODAY PLEASED ME.
00:17:58.327,00:18:00.204,"IT WAS MY MOTHER'S, LOST AMONGST HER THINGS."
00:18:00.329,00:18:02.206,"A WOMAN OF MODEST TASTE, SORELY MISSED."
00:18:02.331,00:18:06.377,PERHAPS WE SHOULD RETURN THE EMERALD NECKLACE WE BOUGHT FROM RAMEL.
00:18:06.502,00:18:12.592,"WELL, IT WAS EXCESSIVE, AND IF THE COIN WILL HELP SPEED YOU FROM THE PITS I'D BE-- KEEP THEM BOTH."
00:18:12.717,00:18:15.553,I WILL NOT HAVE MY WIFE RETURN JEWELRY.
00:18:19.557,00:18:21.976,"I SHOULD WASH, I SMELL OF DEATH."
00:18:22.101,00:18:24.311,"NO, YOU SMELL LIKE A MAN."
00:18:55.969,00:18:57.470,YOU LIVE.
00:19:02.433,00:19:03.810,WHAT OF KERZA?
00:19:05.728,00:19:09.565,"FALLEN, NEVER TO RISE WHOLE."
00:19:13.069,00:19:16.196,THIS IS WHERE GLADIATORS SLEEP.
00:19:16.322,00:19:18.157,NOT DOGS.
00:19:18.282,00:19:19.617,HOLD YOUR TONGUE.
00:19:21.160,00:19:25.832,"HE STAYS, HE WAKES BESIDE KERZA IN THE AFTERLIFE."
00:19:48.187,00:19:52.525,SPARTACUS-- PAY NO MIND TO THOSE INBRED FUCKS.
00:19:52.650,00:19:55.028,THEY SPEAK THE TRUTH.
00:19:55.153,00:19:56.403,I AM NO LONGER A GLADIATOR.
00:19:56.529,00:19:58.238,YOU ARE STILL A MAN.
00:19:58.364,00:19:59.323,AM I?
00:19:59.448,00:20:01.075,ONE DESERVING RESPECT.
00:20:01.200,00:20:05.038,THOUGH I'LL GRANT THE PITS COULD FORCE JUPITER HIMSELF TO DOUBT HIS COCK.

00:32:32.743,00:32:34.745,WILL THE SUM BALANCE OUR DEBTS?
00:32:34.870,00:32:39.207,THE SCALES ARE WELL NUDGED-- BUT BALANCED?
00:32:39.332,00:32:40.751,NO.

00:32:56.015,00:32:59.645,"IF MONEY IS OWED TO OVIDIUS-- THEN IT WILL BE PAID, IN DUE COURSE."
00:32:59.770,00:33:02.021,THE MAN OFFERED ME INSULT AND I WON'T REWARD IT WITH IT SWIFT COIN.
00:33:02.147,00:33:03.064,IS THAT WISE?
00:33:03.189,00:33:08.570,"IF HE COMPLAINS TO THE MAGISTRATE, I WORRY-- I AM THE PATERFAMILIAS, THE WORRY IS MINE ALONE!"
00:33:08.695,00:33:10.071,IS THAT HOW YOU WOKE THIS MORNING?
00:33:10.196,00:33:11.531,ALONE?

00:33:13.992,00:33:18.789,LUCRETIA-- HOW DID YOU COME TO POSSESS THOSE COINS?
00:33:18.914,00:33:20.248,LUCRETIA!
00:33:25.921,00:33:27.213,I COMMANDED YOU TO DO NO SUCH THING!
00:33:27.339,00:33:28.340,COMMANDED?
00:33:28.465,00:33:31.718,YOU MISTAKE ME FOR A SLAVE.
00:33:31.844,00:33:34.095,YOU KNOW MY INTENTIONS BETTER.
00:33:34.220,00:33:38.809,"LUCRETIA, THE EMERALDS-- THEY LOOKED LOVELY ON YOU."
00:33:38.934,00:33:46.984,"TO SEE THEM RETURNED, A CASUALTY OF ILL FINANCES-- THE FAULT WAS MINE, IN PRESSING THE PURCHASE IN THE FIRST PLACE."
00:33:47.108,00:33:50.069,YOUR WORRIES ARE MY WORRIES QUINTUS.
00:33:50.195,00:33:52.071,YOU ARE NEVER ALONE.
00:33:52.197,00:33:54.407,A NOTION TO WARM THE HEART.

00:34:08.087,00:34:11.216,DAYS PAST IT COMMANDED TWICE THAT!
00:34:11.341,00:34:14.011,"WOMEN AND BUSINESS, AND THESE ARE THE RESULTS!"
00:34:14.135,00:34:18.223,"AN OFFER FOR THE FULL PRICE WAS MADE BY SOLONIUS, WHO HAPPENED BY."
00:34:18.348,00:34:20.141,BETTER BUSINESS HAD I ACCEPTED?
00:34:22.310,00:34:25.438,YOU STRUCK THE WISER BARGAIN.
00:34:25.564,00:34:27.900,SOLONIUS KNOWS OF YOUR ACTIVITIES IN THE PITS.
00:34:28.025,00:34:29.359,THE WHOLE CITY DOES BY NOW.

00:37:13.398,00:37:18.653,"REFUSE TO FIGHT, AND I WILL CEASE MY ATTEMPTS TO FIND YOUR WIFE."
00:37:18.778,00:37:20.697,I HAVE TO SAVE HER.
00:37:21.823,00:37:23.575,BEFORE THE RAINS COME.

00:37:43.053,00:37:43.887,YOU WOULD DIE IN THE PITS?
00:37:44.012,00:37:45.847,"WILLINGLY, TO SEE MY FORTUNE RISE?"
00:37:45.972,00:37:52.270,"YES, IF YOU WILL HOLD TO WREST MY WIFE FROM THE SYRIAN WITH A PIECE OF IT."
00:37:52.395,00:37:56.399,WHAT'S TO KEEP ME TO THIS BARGAIN ONCE YOUR BLOOD IS SPILLED?
00:37:56.524,00:37:58.026,HONOR.
00:37:58.151,00:38:02.488,AND THE PROMISE OF VENGEANCE FROM THE AFTERLIFE IF YOU BETRAY IT.
00:38:06.367,00:38:09.037,THE DEAL IS STRUCK.
00:38:09.162,00:38:11.372,MAKE IT APPEAR A SINCERE FIGHT.
00:38:17.336,00:38:18.546,FINISH PREPARING HIM.
00:38:54.666,00:38:58.253,BEHOLD-- SPARTACUS!
00:39:01.965,00:39:04.301,"BEHOLD, IXION!"
00:39:10.932,00:39:12.391,THE WAGER IS PLACED?
00:39:12.517,00:39:15.520,THE SUM HAS BEEN SPREAD AMONG THE BROKERS TO EASE SUSPICION.
00:39:15.645,00:39:19.482,WHAT WEAPONS SHALL THE GODS BLESS THEM WITH?
00:39:19.607,00:39:23.320,OR CURSE THEM WITH EMPTY HANDS?
00:39:23.444,00:39:24.863,CHOOSE YOUR FATE!
00:39:43.840,00:39:47.426,SPARTACUS DRAWS SICA!
00:39:53.558,00:39:57.187,WE HAVE BUT A SINGLE RULE!
00:39:58.230,00:39:59.731,ONLY ONE SURVIVES!
00:41:22.688,00:41:50.800,"NOT YET, NOT YET-- NO!"
00:42:55.573,00:42:57.742,"MY PROTECTOR, AND HERE I STAND BLOODIED!"
00:42:57.867,00:42:59.536,I DID NOT SEE THERE WAS ANOTHER.
00:42:59.660,00:43:01.454,YOU MUST SEE ALL WHEN MY LIFE IS IN THE BALANCE!
00:43:01.579,00:43:05.291,"RING YOUR CROWN WITH EYES, OR HAVE THE TWO YOU POSSESS RIPPED FROM YOUR FUCKING SKULL!"
00:43:05.417,00:43:08.586,"THEIR FLESH CARRIES A BRAND, DOMINUS."
00:43:08.711,00:43:09.712,OF WHAT ORIGIN?
00:43:09.837,00:43:14.717,"UNFAMILIAR, BUT CERTAINLY THE MARK OF A SLAVE."
00:43:14.842,00:43:16.010,SLAVES?
00:43:17.554,00:43:23.726,THEY SEND COMMON FUCKING SLAVES TO KILL BATIATUS!
00:43:23.851,00:43:26.812,COMMON FUCKING SLAVES?
00:43:26.938,00:43:28.273,FUCK!
00:43:31.109,00:43:32.693,FUCK!
00:43:35.905,00:43:37.282,DISCOVER THEIR MASTER.
00:43:39.992,00:43:42.745,I WISH TO HAVE WORDS WITH HIM.
00:43:49.168,00:43:55.258,"JUNO'S LIPS, JUNO'S HEART, JUNO'S BELLY."
00:44:00.513,00:44:03.349,THE KALENDS ARE UPON US.
00:44:03.475,00:44:04.892,THE FIRST DAY OF THE NEW MONTH.
00:44:05.017,00:44:06.727,PREPARE A SACRIFICE.
00:44:06.852,00:44:13.276,PERHAPS THE GODS WILL FINALLY GRACE US WITH A CHILD IN RETURN-- QUINTUS!
00:44:13.401,00:44:15.820,"AYE, IT'S NOTHING, A MINOR ANNOYANCE."
00:44:15.945,00:44:17.489,MINOR?
00:44:17.614,00:44:20.492,"WHY DO YOU SPEAK OF CHILDREN, YET PRESS TO MAKE ME A WIDOW?"
00:44:20.617,00:44:23.578,IT WILL TAKE MORE THAN A SCRATCH TO WREST ME FROM YOUR SIDE.
00:44:23.702,00:44:25.163,"BARELY MORE, SIT."
00:44:27.999,00:44:31.544,AND TELL ME WHO MUST DIE IN RESPONSE.
00:44:31.669,00:44:33.588,THE AGENTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISPATCHED TO THE UNDERWORLD.
00:44:33.712,00:44:37.716,THE HAND BEHIND THEM YET TO BE REVEALED.
00:44:37.842,00:44:40.428,I WARNED YOU OF THE DANGERS OF THE PITS.
00:44:40.553,00:44:44.390,I HAD THOUGHT TO ERASE ALL OUR DEBTS THROUGH THEM AFTER TONIGHT.
00:44:44.516,00:44:47.935,SPARTACUS OFFERED TERMS TO SEE IT SO.
00:44:48.060,00:44:49.604,WHAT TERMS?
00:44:49.728,00:44:51.022,HIS WILLING DEATH TO WAGER UPON.
00:44:51.147,00:44:54.108,LOCATING HIS WIFE THE CRUX OF THE BARGAIN.
00:44:54.233,00:44:55.860,THE THRACIAN IS DEAD?
00:44:56.861,00:44:59.405,"NO, HE YET LIVES."
00:45:01.907,00:45:03.951,AND THE WAGER IS LOST.
00:45:04.076,00:45:06.579,HOW MUCH?
00:45:06.703,00:45:07.872,A SUBSTANTIAL SUM.
00:45:07.997,00:45:09.874,WE DON'T HAVE IT!
00:45:12.877,00:45:15.796,THAT THRACIAN-- HE BRINGS NOTHING BUT SHAME ON OUR HOUSE!
00:45:15.921,00:45:20.385,"WERE IT NOT FOR HIM, YOU WOULD BE A WIDOW."
00:45:20.510,00:45:22.470,HE SAVED MY LIFE IN THE PITS THIS NIGHT.
00:45:22.595,00:45:26.516,A PLACE YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN IF IT WEREN'T FOR HIM.
00:45:26.641,00:45:29.935,"HE IS CURSED, HE IS CURSED BY THE GODS."
00:45:30.061,00:45:35.858,"I WOULD SEE HIS LIFE ENDED, AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN WHEN HE STEPPED INTO THE ARENA, DOOMED FOR EXECUTION."
00:45:35.983,00:45:41.239,"EVERY DAY THAT THE THRACIAN YET LIVES, I FEAR THAT HIS CURSE BECOMES OUR OWN."
00:45:55.294,00:45:57.004,SPARTACUS.
00:46:00.049,00:46:02.093,BATIATUS SUMMONS YOU.
00:46:19.611,00:46:22.988,MY WIFE THINKS YOU ARE CURSED BY THE GODS.
00:46:23.114,00:46:25.824,I'M INCLINED TO AGREE.
00:46:25.950,00:46:27.619,YOU'LL FIND NO ARGUMENT.
00:46:27.744,00:46:32.164,THE RATIONAL COURSE WOULD BE TO END YOUR MISERABLE LIFE BEFORE IT FURTHER INFECTS MINE.
00:46:32.290,00:46:35.792,"A PROMISE WAS MADE, YOU WOULD FIND SURA."
00:46:35.918,00:46:38.296,IF YOU DIED IN THE PITS.
00:46:38.421,00:46:41.006,"YET HERE YOU STAND, ALIVE."
00:46:41.132,00:46:42.550,AS DO YOU.
00:46:49.432,00:46:51.601,PROMISE IS KEPT.
00:46:51.726,00:46:54.145,I WILL CONTINUE THE SEARCH FOR HER.
00:46:57.356,00:46:58.775,YOU SAVED MY LIFE.
00:46:58.941,00:47:02.278,"GODS OR NOT, A DEBT DEMANDS REPAYMENT."
00:47:05.822,00:47:08.993,HE'S TO REJOIN THE GLADIATORS AS SOON AS HE IS ABLE.
00:00:31.072,00:00:32.407,Switch!
00:00:39.581,00:00:41.124,Switch!
00:00:46.797,00:00:48.340,Switch!
00:00:51.969,00:00:53.261,Crixus!
00:00:54.346,00:00:56.724,Did you not hear my instruction?
00:00:56.849,00:00:58.266,"Apologies, Doctore."
00:00:58.392,00:01:01.353,I did not mean to scare the rabbit.
00:01:02.563,00:01:05.774,The games of the Magistrate approach.
00:01:05.900,00:01:13.407,"Listen carefully to my instruction, and every man chosen will see victory in the arena."
00:01:16.201,00:01:18.662,Perhaps not every man.
00:01:18.787,00:01:19.788,Pietros.
00:01:19.914,00:01:22.750,Save the water for men who deserve it.
00:01:32.217,00:01:35.804,"Rain! By Jupiter's cock, would you fucking rain!"
00:01:38.557,00:01:39.767,What are you doing?
00:01:39.892,00:01:41.476,Praying.
00:01:41.602,00:01:42.811,Blaspheming.
00:01:42.937,00:01:46.648,The two are narrowly separated in these trying times.
00:01:46.774,00:01:49.693,Perhaps the gap widens...
00:01:49.818,00:01:51.070,"More creditors, seeking action?"
00:01:51.194,00:01:53.906,"Something of more cheerful note, recently delivered..."
00:01:58.118,00:01:59.954,From Magistrate Calavius!
00:02:02.163,00:02:05.208,He is coming here to personally select men for his games!
00:02:05.333,00:02:07.669,Games to appease the gods and end the drought!
00:02:07.795,00:02:10.923,The biggest games since Theokoles bested 100 men in the arena!
00:02:11.048,00:02:12.466,But why come himself?
00:02:14.301,00:02:16.762,The Primus.
00:02:16.887,00:02:18.889,If we were to secure the main event at these games...
00:02:19.014,00:02:20.515,He arrives within the hour.
00:02:22.350,00:02:23.435,Prepare food.
00:02:25.479,00:02:26.271,"Quintus, your robe..."
00:02:26.396,00:02:27.982,"Uh, it's nothing."
00:02:28.107,00:02:29.149,Fetch the Medicus.
00:02:29.274,00:02:31.401,Lucretia..
00:02:33.445,00:02:35.656,I should talk to the Magistrate about it.
00:02:35.781,00:02:37.658,"Those men tried to kill you, an honest man."
00:02:37.783,00:02:39.118,In a dishonest place.
00:02:39.242,00:02:43.831,"No, we won't concern the Magistrate with these things, not with the Primus in the balance."
00:02:45.749,00:02:49.377,"I'll tend to the matter myself, um."
00:02:53.590,00:02:57.052,That was the mark of one of the slaves who tried to kill Batiatus.
00:03:01.015,00:03:02.933,The mark is unknown to me.
00:03:03.058,00:03:04.225,Perhaps a closer look...
00:03:07.562,00:03:10.816,Details of such craftsmanship should not be viewed in haste.
00:03:13.902,00:03:18.281,I may have seen a similar mark...
00:03:18.406,00:03:20.159,Ahh.
00:03:20.283,00:03:23.286,"So, what do you think?"
00:03:23.411,00:03:26.081,You adorn them like a god.
00:03:26.205,00:03:27.582,I would be out of them...
00:03:27.708,00:03:30.085,and deep into you...
00:03:30.794,00:03:32.546,Apologies.
00:03:32.671,00:03:34.464,Magistrate Calavius arrives.
00:03:34.589,00:03:37.425,"Our fortunes rise, like your cock."
00:03:37.551,00:03:42.056,Stay wet and we'll make it rain presently...ohhh.
00:03:45.851,00:03:47.268,Magistrate!
00:03:47.394,00:03:52.066,You do us honor with your-- presence!
00:03:52.191,00:03:53.567,Good Batiatus!
00:03:52.191,00:03:55.986,I was telling Solonius how I knew your father.
00:03:56.111,00:03:58.197,Now there was a true Roman.
00:03:58.321,00:04:02.743,"A great man, none of his like to follow."
00:04:02.868,00:04:04.786,I will attempt to fill your needs as he would have.
00:04:04.912,00:04:06.872,To business then.
00:04:08.373,00:04:11.919,"As you well know, the drought has parched the city to the point of madness."
00:04:12.044,00:04:17.340,"We've tried everything to tempted the skies into tears, even to the point of Hecatombe."
00:04:17.465,00:04:19.634,"A hundred cattle sacrificed, and yet not a drop."
00:04:19.760,00:04:21.220,Because the gods do not want the blood of cattle.
00:04:21.344,00:04:22.679,They want the blood of men!
00:04:22.804,00:04:27.684,Good Solonius has been kind enough to lend a hand in organizing games to appease their appetite.
00:04:27.809,00:04:30.020,It will be Sine Missione.
00:04:31.897,00:04:35.984,Only the finest gladiators will be invited to participate.
00:04:36.110,00:04:38.570,Only the finest are offered in the house of Batiatus.
00:04:40.530,00:04:42.199,"Come, examine my wares."
00:04:49.206,00:04:53.668,"An impressive selection, rivaling that of good Solonius himself."
00:04:53.794,00:04:55.378,Yet I have the Primus.
00:04:55.503,00:04:57.172,Half.
00:04:59.507,00:05:08.267,"If you wish to appease the gods, you must have one upon the sands Crixus the champion of Capua, will willing fight anyone that Solonius has to offer."
00:05:08.391,00:05:09.893,Excellent!
00:05:10.018,00:05:13.147,It will truly be a contest between legends!
00:05:14.773,00:05:16.191,Legends?
00:05:16.316,00:05:18.860,"Oh, did I fail to mention?"
00:05:18.986,00:05:21.947,Good Solonius has secured Theokoles for the Primus!
00:05:22.072,00:05:24.116,Theokoles?
00:05:24.241,00:05:27.244,"I managed to coax him to our fair city, at great expense."
00:05:27.368,00:05:28.954,With our gratitude.
00:05:29.079,00:05:32.457,"If the gods fail to grant us rain with such a tribute, then we are surely cursed."
00:05:32.582,00:05:34.459,I fear the gods will be displeased.
00:05:36.211,00:05:41.091,Only one man Theokoles and lived.
00:05:41.216,00:05:44.928,What if Crixus were joined by your man Spartacus?
00:05:45.053,00:05:49.474,"His death was fated in execution, Yet he refuse to own it."
00:05:49.599,00:05:52.894,And cost me four men in his defiance.
00:05:53.020,00:05:56.064,"Your debts are well known, Batiatus."
00:05:56.190,00:06:02.112,"Even if you lose the men, the purse is enough to hold off your creditors, for a moment."
00:06:02.237,00:06:05.866,"Unless of course you would rather sit out these games or any others that follow, which..."
00:06:05.991,00:06:08.118,No. I will set my men to the task.
00:06:16.710,00:06:18.670,My titans!
00:06:18.795,00:06:20.463,"Pause, and hear glorious news!"
00:06:23.008,00:06:29.388,Magistrate Titus Calavius has invited our best men to fight in his Primus!
00:06:29.514,00:06:30.557,Crixus!
00:06:30.682,00:06:31.892,Step forward!
00:06:35.103,00:06:37.147,Spartacus! Step forward.
00:06:42.485,00:06:45.446,You have been chosen to fight as one...
00:06:45.572,00:06:48.992,"against Theokoles, the Shadow of Death!"
00:07:01.004,00:07:01.922,Fuck! Ow! Ow!
00:07:02.047,00:07:03.298,Fuck! Ow!
00:07:03.422,00:07:05.008,Shit! Fuck!
00:07:05.133,00:07:06.634,Ow! Ow! Shit!
00:07:06.760,00:07:09.137,Fuck! Ow! Ow!
00:07:14.517,00:07:16.603,I think you two will make a fine couple.
00:07:19.147,00:07:20.857,I'd rather fight without him.
00:07:20.982,00:07:22.317,And die the same.
00:07:24.194,00:07:25.362,This Theokoles.
00:07:26.947,00:07:28.573,The legends can't be true.
00:07:28.698,00:07:32.452,"He's been cut a thousand times in the arena, he's never fallen."
00:07:34.121,00:07:36.290,I fear you would have been safer in the Pits.
00:07:37.165,00:07:41.878,"If we were to win, how large would be the purse?"
00:07:42.003,00:07:45.424,Large enough to wrest ten wives from the Syrian.
00:07:53.556,00:07:54.557,You send them to certain death.
00:07:54.682,00:07:55.892,Let me fight in their stead.
00:07:56.017,00:07:57.185,That's an excellent suggestion.
00:07:57.311,00:07:58.686,I owe Theokoles a debt of pain.
00:07:58.812,00:07:59.729,You were not requested!
00:07:59.854,00:08:02.941,"Look, no one has forgotten how bravely you fought against Theokoles, old friend."
00:08:03.066,00:08:04.734,Yet without victory.
00:08:04.859,00:08:06.945,You stand the only man to face him in the arena and live.
00:08:07.070,00:08:08.655,That in itself is a victory.
00:08:10.282,00:08:13.368,Set your purpose to the task of training Crixus and Spartacus for the match.
00:08:13.493,00:08:16.913,I fear no amount will save them from the Shadow's grasp.
00:08:17.038,00:08:19.374,Then prepare them for a glorious death.
00:08:26.173,00:08:30.551,"The brand belonged to Remus, a slave trader plying wares north of the city."
00:08:30.677,00:08:32.012,Remus? The name holds no recognition.
00:08:32.137,00:08:37.017,"Nor to I. Yet, if I were to purchase a slave, intent on foul designs..."
00:08:37.142,00:08:41.271,"Then it would be from outside Capua, to avoid simple discovery."
00:08:41.396,00:08:43.606,Find Remus and bring him.
00:08:43.731,00:08:45.359,I would have conversation.
00:08:45.484,00:08:46.734,Dominus.
00:08:54.159,00:08:55.743,Water.
00:09:02.083,00:09:03.126,From Domina.
00:09:03.251,00:09:04.961,To help with your training.
00:09:14.846,00:09:16.431,Wait a moment.
00:09:20.310,00:09:21.686,To what purpose?
00:09:23.813,00:09:25.440,Need there be one?
00:09:28.402,00:09:30.070,You shouldn't look at me in that way.
00:09:31.738,00:09:35.658,I try with all my strength not to.
00:09:35.783,00:09:37.035,But I am weak.
00:09:43.500,00:09:46.253,"Sleep, then."
00:09:46.378,00:09:48.713,And regain your strength.
00:09:58.598,00:09:59.891,I seek no quarrel.
00:10:00.016,00:10:02.352,Your presence here would state otherwise.
00:10:02.477,00:10:04.020,We've had our differences.
00:10:04.145,00:10:05.105,I own my part in them.
00:10:05.230,00:10:06.481,Yet if we are to defeat Theokoles..
00:10:06.606,00:10:07.941,We?
00:10:08.066,00:10:10.985,There is no such thing in the arena.
00:10:11.111,00:10:15.532,You believe you can slay the giant?
00:10:15.656,00:10:16.657,Alone?
00:10:16.783,00:10:18.618,As I always stand.
00:10:18.743,00:10:19.786,This time you do not.
00:10:19.911,00:10:24.291,"When Theokoles falls, the glory will be mine."
00:10:24.416,00:10:30.547,"And if we do not come to common ground, the death shared will be ours."
00:10:44.185,00:10:47.355,Oh. As if they stand chance against Theokoles.
00:10:47.481,00:10:49.232,Um. Perhaps the gods will favor them.
00:10:49.357,00:10:53.361,"Yes, and perhaps I should sprout wings and flutter off."
00:10:53.487,00:10:55.780,The odds lay a thousand to one against them.
00:10:55.905,00:10:59.409,No man has ever won betting against Crixus.
00:10:59.534,00:11:02.412,I would lay coin towards their victory.
00:11:04.205,00:11:05.499,A fool's wager.
00:11:05.624,00:11:07.542,Happily received.
00:11:12.255,00:11:13.214,You leave without words.
00:11:13.340,00:11:15.049,None to give.
00:11:15.175,00:11:18.512,"Each time you step beyond these walls, I fear for you and what..."
00:11:18.637,00:11:20.514,Grab hold of your cock and be a man!
00:11:23.724,00:11:26.311,"I do what I must, Pietros."
00:11:26.436,00:11:27.604,I'll return soon.
00:11:39.574,00:11:41.535,Mind the birds.
00:11:42.452,00:11:43.953,Pietros!
00:11:44.078,00:11:46.289,Weapons!
00:11:55.173,00:11:56.174,Ilithyia?
00:11:56.299,00:11:58.134,She comes at my invitation.
00:11:58.259,00:12:00.679,Now's not the time to be entertaining that spoiled little bitch.
00:12:00.803,00:12:02.721,Her father Albinius holds the Magistrate's ear.
00:12:02.847,00:12:06.434,"If he were to place a word in it, Then Crixus may be replaced in the Primus."
00:12:06.560,00:12:08.769,He could place a thousand and to no result.
00:12:08.895,00:12:10.605,Solonius maneuvered you.
00:12:10.771,00:12:12.357,With the aid of the Magistrate!
00:12:12.482,00:12:15.776,Refuse and we would quickly find ourselves excluded from the arena altogether.
00:12:15.902,00:12:16.819,And if Crixus falls?
00:12:16.944,00:12:19.656,Who will be our champion?
00:12:19.780,00:12:21.491,Who will the crowds clamor to see from the house of Batiatus?
00:12:21.616,00:12:23.117,"Not Spartacus, that thing from the Pits?"
00:12:25.953,00:12:26.913,Your guest arrives.
00:12:27.038,00:12:28.456,Do not broach the subject with her.
00:12:30.417,00:12:31.501,Ilithyia!
00:12:31.626,00:12:34.254,You do us honor with your presence.
00:12:34.379,00:12:36.881,I would trade honor for water.
00:12:39.842,00:12:42.761,"Ah, the heat is a thing living, crawling down the throat."
00:12:42.887,00:12:45.139,"Well, let us quench that thirst."
00:12:45.265,00:12:47.058,I must to tend to business of the games.
00:12:47.183,00:12:48.602,I leave you in loving hands.
00:12:50.395,00:12:52.606,"Is it true, then?"
00:12:52.731,00:12:56.234,Crixus and Spartacus face the Shadow of Death?
00:12:56.359,00:12:58.361,They do.
00:12:58.486,00:13:00.739,Blood will surely flow on the day.
00:13:00.863,00:13:04.242,I long to see it pour from the Thracian.
00:13:17.922,00:13:20.258,You attack as you would a man.
00:13:20.383,00:13:23.553,Theokoles is beyond flesh.
00:13:23.678,00:13:25.846,Beyond blood and bone.
00:13:25.972,00:13:29.183,He is the shadow that precedes death.
00:13:29.309,00:13:32.437,Allow him to fall upon you alone...
00:13:32.562,00:13:35.022,and you are dead.
00:13:35.148,00:13:39.068,"Now rise, and come at me as one!"
00:13:41.237,00:13:43.615,"Give way, you fuck!"
00:13:43.740,00:13:45.283,The advantage was mine!
00:14:00.047,00:14:02.425,How Crixus moves.
00:14:04.469,00:14:06.513,the way his muscles catch the sun...
00:14:10.433,00:14:12.686,Truly the Champion of Capua.
00:14:14.020,00:14:15.647,None to his equal.
00:14:18.441,00:14:20.777,You jostle and trip over the other like fools.
00:14:20.901,00:14:22.987,You face Theokoles in the Primus!
00:14:25.657,00:14:27.575,Prove yourselves worthy!
00:14:45.802,00:14:47.345,Pathetic.
00:14:49.389,00:14:50.849,I crave a closer look.
00:14:53.434,00:14:55.353,Can we go down among them?
00:14:59.399,00:15:00.775,My husband would never allow it.
00:15:01.901,00:15:05.238,The bowels of a ludus are no place for a senator's daughter.
00:15:05.363,00:15:08.491,"A private viewing then, in the villa?"
00:15:08.616,00:15:12.995,"I would pay for it, of course."
00:15:13.120,00:15:16.416,A favor amongst friends.
00:15:16.541,00:15:18.918,"You must let me return it, then."
00:15:19.043,00:15:23.506,"I've given thought to your problem, and have discovered solution."
00:15:23.631,00:15:25.007,Problem...?
00:15:26.676,00:15:29.345,Children.
00:15:30.555,00:15:36.352,"I've heard of a woman, a priestess of Juno, blessed with certain gifts of fertility."
00:15:36.477,00:15:38.646,Many prominent women speak of her.
00:15:38.772,00:15:42.609,"Servillia, Cornelia, Laelia.."
00:15:42.734,00:15:43.693,Ovidius' wife?
00:15:43.818,00:15:45.278,You know her?
00:15:45.403,00:15:47.405,"Oh, in passing."
00:15:47.530,00:15:51.659,"And would have none, if not touched by the woman I speak of."
00:15:51.785,00:15:54.454,Will you let me arrange it for you?
00:15:54.579,00:15:56.915,As a gift for your hospitality?
00:16:03.087,00:16:05.256,"We are friends, aren't we?"
00:16:05.381,00:16:06.800,The very best.
00:16:12.012,00:16:17.143,"How are we to fare against Theokoles, when we cannot even best Doctore?"
00:16:17.268,00:16:20.438,"I could have bested him a dozen times, if you'd not gotten underfoot."
00:16:20.563,00:16:23.357,"I take the sands beside you in this fight, Crixus."
00:16:23.483,00:16:28.404,"Just because you stand beside me with sword and shield, do not mistake yourself as a gladiator."
00:16:28.529,00:16:31.658,"I fight to honor these walls, you fight to leave them."
00:16:31.783,00:16:34.619,You fight...
00:16:34.744,00:16:37.580,because you are a slave.
00:16:37.705,00:16:38.539,Like me.
00:16:38.665,00:16:39.540,No.
00:16:39.666,00:16:41.041,Not like you.
00:16:43.336,00:16:44.462,I embrace it.
00:16:44.587,00:16:46.631,But you...
00:16:48.716,00:16:52.261,Where that wife of yours we've all heard about is still nestled by your side.
00:16:52.386,00:16:54.597,"And that is all it is, Spartacus."
00:16:54.722,00:16:58.726,A dream and one day soon you will awaken to the truth.
00:17:00.603,00:17:03.606,You will never leave this place.
00:17:03.731,00:17:10.321,"And your wife if she's not dead already, has been fucked to madness by a hundred Roman cocks."
00:17:33.469,00:17:35.805,Get yourselves cleaned up.
00:17:35.930,00:17:38.098,Domina requests your presence.
00:17:38.224,00:17:39.767,Both of you.
00:17:52.279,00:17:55.115,"Do you know who I am, Thracian?"
00:17:59.787,00:18:03.041,Speak.
00:18:03.165,00:18:05.668,I have seen you.
00:18:05.793,00:18:08.963,With Legatus Glaber.
00:18:09.088,00:18:11.215,I am his wife.
00:18:14.635,00:18:20.934,"He is regrettably abroad, and will not be able to Theokoles."
00:18:24.854,00:18:40.703,"But-- I shall whisper of it to him, replaying the moment when we are entwined in our bed."
00:18:46.960,00:18:48.502,Apologies.
00:18:48.628,00:18:50.254,I require the Thracian for a moment.
00:18:51.089,00:18:52.673,Extend it by a lifetime.
00:18:52.799,00:18:54.133,I am done with him.
00:18:55.217,00:18:56.970,My office.
00:19:03.350,00:19:05.853,A rare honor to receive a private audience.
00:19:05.979,00:19:09.273,One I am most appreciative of.
00:19:09.398,00:19:17.281,"Although, he does seem a touch overdressed for the occasion."
00:19:29.961,00:19:35.133,Your champion is bold to his purpose.
00:19:35.257,00:19:36.425,I take my leave.
00:19:57.905,00:19:59.949,His flesh is so hard...
00:20:10.376,00:20:12.086,like marble.
00:20:18.759,00:20:23.764,Would that every man were carved so...
00:20:26.559,00:20:28.227,We'd best not keep him.
00:20:28.352,00:20:31.647,His training resumes at first light.
00:20:36.194,00:20:39.446,Only the gods know.
00:20:39.572,00:20:44.077,It would be pity to see such a man marred.
00:20:52.543,00:20:56.338,Perhaps there is a way to see such a tragedy averted.
00:20:58.257,00:21:01.219,If your father where to speak to the Magistrate.
00:21:01.343,00:21:05.181,perhaps...
00:21:05.305,00:21:08.142,To seeing Crixus replaced in the games.
00:21:10.895,00:21:13.064,Is that what you want?
00:21:21.739,00:21:24.075,I long for it.
00:21:27.120,00:21:29.205,As I long to see it.
00:21:33.960,00:21:43.928,"You survived being dragged from your homeland by Legatus Glaber, You survived execution by four gladiators in the arena."
00:21:44.053,00:21:47.140,You even survived the horror of the Pits.
00:21:54.688,00:21:57.691,Can you survive this?
00:21:57.817,00:22:00.360,Crixus and I fight at cross-purposes.
00:22:00.486,00:22:02.655,Then find a way to unite them.
00:22:04.573,00:22:08.244,"You may have saved my life, but yours is yet worth little in the arena."
00:22:08.368,00:22:14.000,But to loose Crixus along with you that would be a blow from which this ludus would not recover.
00:22:14.125,00:22:16.710,My concern is only for my wife.
00:22:16.836,00:22:18.420,And her fate is tied to these walls.
00:22:18.545,00:22:23.259,"If they collapse around me, then I will be unable to help her from beneath the rubble."
00:22:25.678,00:22:27.805,I will not die until she is safe.
00:22:27.930,00:22:29.723,"Well, prove it so."
00:22:29.849,00:22:31.058,"Fight as one with Crixus, to best Theokoles."
00:22:31.184,00:22:33.602,Or we are all fucked.
00:22:34.520,00:22:35.896,Yes.
00:22:41.068,00:22:44.822,"Barca has returned, bearing gifts."
00:22:47.867,00:22:49.285,Remove him to the barracks.
00:23:06.093,00:23:06.844,Who purchased them?
00:23:06.969,00:23:09.387,I know not of what you speak...
00:23:09.513,00:23:12.016,I speak of being fucked.
00:23:12.141,00:23:18.022,"By the gods, by the Magistrate, by that cock suck Solonius and his grinning schemes!"
00:23:18.147,00:23:20.733,I'm of proud family!
00:23:20.858,00:23:24.737,"A family of means and history, you fucking cunt!"
00:23:26.113,00:23:27.573,You sold the men!
00:23:27.698,00:23:34.538,"Common slaves, who tried to kill me, tried to fuck me like a whore!"
00:23:34.663,00:23:37.291,But I will not be fucked!
00:23:37.415,00:23:38.292,I! WILL! NOT!
00:23:38.416,00:23:39.752,NOT! BE! FUCKED!
00:23:39.877,00:23:42.588,You fuck you...
00:23:42.713,00:23:47.885,"you fucking hemorrhoid sucking fuck, YOU FUCK!"
00:23:53.182,00:23:55.059,Ovidius.
00:23:55.184,00:23:56.143,What?
00:23:56.269,00:23:57.978,Ovidius...
00:23:58.104,00:23:59.605,Sold...
00:23:59.730,00:24:02.149,to Ovidius...
00:24:05.945,00:24:08.530,There was that so fucking hard?
00:24:08.655,00:24:10.908,Ovidius' cousin is the Magistrate.
00:24:11.033,00:24:14.578,"He could be cousin to Jupiter himself, I don't give a shit."
00:24:14.703,00:24:16.580,I will have satisfaction.
00:24:18.999,00:24:21.127,You dishonor me.
00:24:21.252,00:24:23.087,The Thracian impedes my attack.
00:24:23.212,00:24:24.504,I seek to strengthen it.
00:24:24.630,00:24:25.589,I seek no aid.
00:24:25.714,00:24:30.928,"No, you need the gods to descend and fight by your side!"
00:24:31.053,00:24:33.680,Even then victory is doubtful.
00:24:37.143,00:24:39.645,"Words, falling on deaf ears."
00:24:44.108,00:24:46.526,"Attend your eyes, then..."
00:24:56.203,00:24:57.997,My failure.
00:24:58.122,00:25:00.082,Your lesson.
00:25:06.380,00:25:08.048,His first cut...
00:25:09.967,00:25:13.262,Dealt when I thought him vulnerable.
00:25:13.387,00:25:16.140,and pressed my attack unwisely.
00:25:18.892,00:25:20.853,His next assault..
00:25:20.978,00:25:25.816,came as I fell back to regain position....
00:25:28.944,00:25:31.155,Yet these wounds are nothing.
00:25:33.491,00:25:35.533,"A game of blood, to amuse the crowd."
00:25:35.659,00:25:42.749,"And when he tires of playing, he will move to separate your head.."
00:25:42.875,00:25:44.335,from your neck...
00:25:46.045,00:25:52.301,I live because I survived longer than any man that stood against him.
00:25:52.426,00:25:54.678,Some herald that as a victory.
00:25:55.846,00:25:57.597,I am not among them.
00:26:00.767,00:26:03.854,You tell us the Shadow wounds both when he is pressed and when he is given ground.
00:26:03.979,00:26:06.648,How will he to be defeated?
00:26:06.773,00:26:09.902,By accomplishing both at once.
00:26:10.027,00:26:10.903,Press...
00:26:11.028,00:26:12.446,and defend.
00:26:12.570,00:26:13.531,Distract...
00:26:13.655,00:26:15.199,and strike.
00:26:15.324,00:26:16.534,Fight as one.
00:26:19.203,00:26:21.163,Or die as two.
00:26:31.090,00:26:35.802,"Now, show me the way to honor."
00:26:39.139,00:26:42.809,"The games tomorrow, and yet he presses them."
00:26:42.935,00:26:44.520,To their benefit.
00:26:47.231,00:26:49.108,I have business in town.
00:26:49.233,00:26:51.818,It'll take me until late into the night.
00:26:53.237,00:26:54.405,Lucretia.
00:26:54.530,00:26:55.281,Um?
00:26:55.406,00:26:56.574,Business.
00:26:56.698,00:26:59.952,"Yeah, business, I heard you."
00:27:00.077,00:27:03.705,If you would prefer I delay..
00:27:03.830,00:27:05.999,"No, I have diversion."
00:27:06.125,00:27:09.336,Ilithyia's coming with her Priestess.
00:27:14.216,00:27:17.844,May the gods grant us miracle.
00:27:17.970,00:27:20.514,They fucking owe us something.
00:27:40.909,00:27:42.578,"A word of advice, Spartacus."
00:27:44.662,00:27:45.831,At what cost?
00:27:45.956,00:27:48.167,Freely given.
00:27:48.292,00:27:50.752,Do not think you can come to terms with Crixus.
00:27:50.877,00:27:56.091,I've trusted him once in the arena and this was the result...
00:27:58.177,00:28:01.096,he may as well have cut the balls from my shaft.
00:28:03.807,00:28:05.767,He'd turn a sword against his ally?
00:28:05.892,00:28:08.812,"Even Barca, if stood between him and glory."
00:28:08.937,00:28:16.654,The only way to survive against Theokoles is to consider Crixus an equal enemy.
00:28:42.721,00:28:47.142,How often do you engage in intercourse?
00:28:47.267,00:28:48.644,Several times a week.
00:28:48.768,00:28:50.270,Sometimes more.
00:28:50.396,00:28:52.481,Has seed ever taken hold?
00:28:52.606,00:28:53.815,Never.
00:28:56.443,00:28:59.988,"Have there been other men, besides your husband?"
00:29:03.409,00:29:05.827,What bearing does that have?
00:29:09.498,00:29:11.124,The ritual is usually a private matter.
00:29:11.250,00:29:12.459,Perhaps..
00:29:12.585,00:29:16.088,"Oh please, can I stay?"
00:29:16.213,00:29:17.631,I've never seen one of these.
00:29:17.756,00:29:20.217,It's so intriguing.
00:29:23.637,00:29:25.389,Other men?
00:29:25.514,00:29:28.975,Have there been any?
00:29:29.101,00:29:30.977,Yes.
00:29:33.272,00:29:35.733,One. But frequently.
00:29:35.857,00:29:40.195,"Then the difficulty lies not with the seed, but within the vessel."
00:29:44.032,00:29:46.410,You mean there's something wrong with her?
00:29:46.535,00:29:49.246,The gods have decided to withhold the joy of children.
00:29:49.371,00:29:51.790,But we will entreat them to reconsider...
00:30:21.695,00:30:24.281,Juno has blessed you.
00:30:24.406,00:30:26.950,You must copulate within the hour.
00:30:27.075,00:30:28.494,So soon?
00:30:28.619,00:30:30.954,Before the flame of life expires.
00:30:32.790,00:30:34.750,Good fortune be with you.
00:30:44.259,00:30:46.386,Only an hour?
00:30:46.512,00:30:50.432,"You think she would have told you that before she started, considering her price."
00:30:50.557,00:30:51.975,Gratitude for arranging this.
00:30:52.100,00:30:54.561,Unnecessary words from a friend.
00:30:54.687,00:30:59.692,"And I being yours, I'll leave you to complete the ritual."
00:30:59.817,00:31:08.784,Although tales of this other man will be most expected when time is not at issue...
00:31:12.371,00:31:15.708,Why are the fucking torches not lit?
00:31:15.833,00:31:17.501,Laelia...?
00:31:36.687,00:31:38.647,"I owe you a debt, Ovidius."
00:31:38.772,00:31:40.273,I've come to repay.
00:31:44.695,00:31:46.488,Please.
00:31:46.613,00:31:49.324,The boy is unstained.
00:31:51.744,00:31:55.497,No child is unstained by the deeds of his father.
00:31:55.622,00:31:57.541,They are not my own.
00:31:57.666,00:31:59.877,"Two slaves, sent from Remus to take my life."
00:32:00.001,00:32:03.171,Do you deny giving coin to the cause?
00:32:03.296,00:32:05.340,"I hired the men, yes."
00:32:05.465,00:32:07.342,But to another's purpose.
00:32:07.467,00:32:08.844,Whose?
00:32:13.515,00:32:14.974,Whose?
00:32:16.476,00:32:19.563,"Speak the name, and I swear to the gods I will not kill you."
00:32:23.609,00:32:25.944,Solonius.
00:32:26.069,00:32:28.864,He paid the balance of your debt to me.
00:32:28.988,00:32:33.326,In exchange for me arranging your death.
00:32:37.163,00:32:40.417,"Gratitude for your honesty, Ovidius."
00:32:40.542,00:32:43.211,"You're not going to kill me, then?"
00:32:43.336,00:32:44.713,No.
00:32:47.173,00:32:49.175,My slave is going to kill you.
00:33:07.444,00:33:10.697,Burn this fucking place to the ground.
00:33:10.823,00:33:12.658,But first...
00:33:12.783,00:33:14.493,take care of the child.
00:33:23.209,00:33:24.878,You were right.
00:33:26.588,00:33:28.590,I do not honor these walls.
00:33:30.258,00:33:32.260,A fact well known.
00:33:34.179,00:33:35.806,Has it always been so for you?
00:33:38.642,00:33:43.355,"When you were brought here for the first time, against your will?"
00:33:43.480,00:33:47.275,Your life traded for a few coins?
00:33:49.068,00:33:51.989,More than a few.
00:33:52.113,00:33:53.782,"Is that your worth, then?"
00:34:00.163,00:34:04.584,Has it ever occurred to you why the great Theokoles would grace us with his presence?
00:34:06.837,00:34:09.381,A promise of wealth.
00:34:11.466,00:34:14.344,The Shadow has earned a thousand fortunes.
00:34:14.469,00:34:21.768,"He comes here not for coin, he comes here for the glory of facing the Champion of Capua."
00:34:23.395,00:34:24.938,The undefeated Gaul.
00:34:28.191,00:34:30.235,Glory.
00:34:30.360,00:34:34.740,"There is no greater thing, than standing victorious arena."
00:34:37.409,00:34:41.788,Is there no purpose beyond the blood?
00:34:41.914,00:34:46.418,No dream beyond the cheering crowd?
00:34:46.543,00:34:49.170,Is there nothing else you fight for?
00:34:51.214,00:34:54.175,"Crixus, you are summoned."
00:35:19.076,00:35:20.577,Step into the light.
00:35:24.205,00:35:26.750,Let me gaze upon the Champion of Capua.
00:35:30.003,00:35:32.631,You are truly a wonder.
00:35:32.756,00:35:34.049,"As are you, Domina."
00:35:37.427,00:35:42.015,We don't have much time and I would see it well used.
00:35:44.810,00:35:47.771,Do I stir you to passion?
00:35:47.896,00:35:49.272,"Yes, Domina."
00:35:54.611,00:35:56.905,Your cock would disagree.
00:35:57.030,00:35:59.240,Excuse my distraction Domina.
00:36:03.495,00:36:09.126,"I would have you in the moment, deep inside me."
00:36:11.336,00:36:14.589,I've never faced an opponent like Theokoles...
00:36:14.714,00:36:19.094,And he has never meet a man like you...
00:36:24.182,00:36:26.643,I beg a favor Domina.
00:36:26.768,00:36:28.854,Love makes a man weak before battle...
00:36:45.495,00:36:47.873,I would have you strong.
00:36:50.042,00:36:55.964,"We will forgo the pleasures of a single evening, and pray to the gods for many more to come."
00:37:04.890,00:37:07.392,Domina.
00:37:33.543,00:37:35.962,You are going to die tomorrow aren't you?
00:37:38.006,00:37:39.716,Only the gods divine the future.
00:37:41.760,00:37:44.804,Why didn't you let Ilithyia help you?
00:37:44.930,00:37:47.140,She could have spoken to her father..
00:37:47.265,00:37:49.142,To what end?
00:37:51.144,00:37:52.645,Humiliation?
00:37:55.440,00:37:58.484,Honor and glory.
00:37:58.610,00:38:00.528,"That's all you care about, isn't it?"
00:38:09.955,00:38:11.623,Not all.
00:38:18.546,00:38:20.173,Still the fool.
00:38:23.135,00:38:25.220,Still.
00:38:33.436,00:38:35.105,You said love drains a man.
00:38:37.065,00:38:41.402,"It can give him hope, in the right arms..."
00:39:00.463,00:39:02.423,The odds do not favor you.
00:39:03.967,00:39:05.343,They seldom do.
00:39:07.887,00:39:11.057,I've heard Barca has laid a large amount of coin on you.
00:39:11.183,00:39:14.102,"More towards Crixus, but still..."
00:39:14.227,00:39:15.436,And you?
00:39:18.523,00:39:24.904,"If I had the means, I would wager all with Barca."
00:39:25.030,00:39:27.199,You're too fucking stubborn to die.
00:39:31.077,00:39:32.287,Every man has his end.
00:39:34.039,00:39:37.125,I pray to the gods you have not yet reached yours.
00:39:41.504,00:39:48.345,"If they do not answer, I would ask a thing of you."
00:39:48.469,00:39:50.722,I will do everything I can to find her.
00:39:56.186,00:39:58.104,Now sleep.
00:39:58.230,00:40:00.106,Tomorrow you face a legend.
00:40:01.358,00:40:04.194,And may yet become one yourself.
00:40:26.216,00:40:27.133,Did you see it?!
00:40:27.259,00:40:30.136,"Septimus the victor, as I said!"
00:40:30.262,00:40:35.808,"Valarius always drops his shield when he attacks, a disadvantage against the spear."
00:40:35.934,00:40:37.269,The boy has a keen eye.
00:40:37.394,00:40:38.353,"Towards gladiators, yes."
00:40:38.477,00:40:40.355,His studies are another matter.
00:40:49.530,00:40:52.158,My hour of glory is long past.
00:40:52.284,00:40:55.745,Yours stands before you.
00:40:59.082,00:41:02.168,Kill that fucking son of a whore.
00:41:09.134,00:41:10.802,"Finally, the Primus."
00:41:10.927,00:41:14.013,Another moment and my tongue would turn to dust.
00:41:14.139,00:41:16.308,Water.
00:41:16.433,00:41:17.475,"Apologies, Domina."
00:41:17.600,00:41:20.061,We've used our last.
00:41:20.186,00:41:22.855,Please.
00:41:24.065,00:41:24.983,"You're too kind, good Solonius."
00:41:25.108,00:41:27.735,"You'd do the same, if you were able."
00:41:27.860,00:41:33.158,No matter.
00:41:27.860,00:41:35.952,"Soon Theokoles will honor the gods with blood, they turn will bless us with endless rain."
00:41:36.077,00:41:37.620,I pray for the truth in it.
00:41:37.745,00:41:40.290,This drought is driving the city mad!
00:41:40.415,00:41:45.795,Unfortunate word has reached us that our dearest cousin Ovidius was murdered in his home.
00:41:49.382,00:41:50.258,Ovidius?
00:41:50.383,00:41:52.135,No.
00:41:52.260,00:41:55.763,I mentioned his wife not a night ago.
00:41:55.888,00:41:57.056,What of his son?
00:41:57.182,00:41:59.351,He was so young.
00:41:59.476,00:42:03.480,"Their villa was burnt, only a few bodies yet recovered."
00:42:03.604,00:42:07.066,I fear the boy is among the ruins.
00:42:07.192,00:42:09.194,A tragedy.
00:42:09.319,00:42:12.322,One cannot but wonder what would prompt such an act.
00:42:16.617,00:42:21.039,"Let us turn our minds to thoughts of rain, to cool the fevered brow of our city."
00:42:23.916,00:42:26.836,Citizens of Capua!
00:42:26.961,00:42:28.629,Brothers of Rome!
00:42:31.383,00:42:40.725,"In the name of my forefathers, I, Titus Calavius, present to you, the final event!"
00:42:40.850,00:42:44.937,"Your woman, is she the reason A spectacle of blood and death, you refuse to die?"
00:42:45.063,00:42:48.900,"a sacrifice to Ceres, She is."
00:42:49.025,00:42:50.527,the great goddess of renewal!
00:42:50.651,00:42:52.570,then perhaps there is something beyond glory.
00:42:52.695,00:42:55.323,... shower us with an ocean of rain!
00:42:56.866,00:43:03.039,From the house of Quintus Lentulus Batiatus.
00:43:03.164,00:43:07.335,"Behold, Spartacus! Thraex!"
00:43:19.389,00:43:22.934,The Champion of Capua!
00:43:23.059,00:43:26.604,"Behold, Crixus!"
00:43:26.729,00:43:28.481,Murmillo!
00:43:31.650,00:43:32.944,Crixus! Crixus!
00:43:33.069,00:43:34.946,Crixus!
00:43:38.324,00:43:40.493,Capua!
00:43:43.871,00:43:45.540,Shall we begin?
00:43:57.510,00:44:03.057,Together they stand against a man who has never fallen.
00:44:03.182,00:44:07.145,A beast that has never been tamed.
00:44:07.270,00:44:12.358,A legend that has never been tarnished.
00:45:23.638,00:45:25.973,Ahh!
00:45:28.226,00:45:29.477,Begin!
00:45:46.952,00:45:48.371,They draw blood!
00:46:45.511,00:46:46.971,Yes!
00:46:47.096,00:46:48.514,YES!
00:47:37.854,00:47:40.358,"Yeah, Capua!"
00:48:03.798,00:48:05.341,Capua!
00:48:05.466,00:48:07.802,Shall I begin?!
00:48:20.481,00:48:22.316,Get out of the way.
00:48:28.947,00:48:32.076,"Give ground, or I'll kill you myself!"
00:50:06.587,00:50:08.714,Theokoles!
00:51:11.736,00:51:14.070,Kill! Kill! Kill!
00:51:22.621,00:51:24.456,Yes!
00:53:01.679,00:53:03.388,Spar-ta-cus!!
00:53:03.514,00:53:08.144,Spar-ta-cus!!
00:00:22.356,00:00:24.608,We have seen misfortune.
00:00:24.733,00:00:27.987,Felt the sting of defeat.
00:00:28.111,00:00:31.866,The humility of vacant purse and empty stomach.
00:00:31.991,00:00:37.037,Some believed the House of Batiatus would never reclaim its former glory.
00:00:41.249,00:00:43.711,But we have proved them wrong.
00:00:43.836,00:00:45.086,Yeah!
00:00:45.212,00:00:50.175,We have proved the name Batiatus will live long after we have gone to dust and bone.
00:00:50.300,00:00:51.593,Yeah!
00:00:51.719,00:00:55.180,So stand proud before the Bringer of Rain!
00:00:58.392,00:01:01.144,The new Champion of Capua!
00:01:02.354,00:01:03.355,Spartacus!
00:01:03.480,00:01:05.733,Yeah!
00:01:15.283,00:01:18.328,Spartacus! Spartacus!
00:02:03.457,00:02:08.211,"A titan, his victory eclipsing all others!"
00:02:08.336,00:02:10.089,Quenching our thirst!
00:02:10.213,00:02:13.300,Fulfilling our hopes and dreams!
00:02:13.425,00:02:16.177,"Behold the man, as he becomes legend!"
00:02:16.303,00:02:17.763,Yeah!
00:02:23.978,00:02:26.438,This is only the beginning!
00:02:26.563,00:02:29.357,I will build an empire of blood and glory upon your name!
00:02:29.483,00:02:32.486,He did not stand against Theokoles on his own.
00:02:32.611,00:02:34.404,Crixus is not forgotten.
00:02:34.529,00:02:37.365,"He will always have position, if he survives."
00:02:37.491,00:02:39.409,But Spartacus is the name on the crowd's tongue.
00:02:39.534,00:02:42.913,And I would see it spoken with ever increasing amazement.
00:02:43.038,00:02:45.332,I defeated a man who could not be defeated.
00:02:45.457,00:02:47.626,What more could they expect of me?
00:02:49.336,00:02:51.130,Everything!
00:02:51.254,00:02:52.380,Their appetite is a great beast.
00:02:52.506,00:02:54.675,It must constantly be fed with new delights.
00:02:54.800,00:02:56.927,We'll start by changing your fighting style.
00:02:57.052,00:03:00.263,"Two swords, as Theokoles fought with."
00:03:00.388,00:03:03.391,We'll see the crowds pleasure double with their new hero twice as deadly!
00:03:03.517,00:03:06.561,"And new armor, worthy of a legend!"
00:03:06.687,00:03:08.772,Men will be made to feel smaller by it!
00:03:08.897,00:03:11.232,Women will moisten at the very sight.
00:03:14.235,00:03:16.279,"Ah, but I forget."
00:03:16.404,00:03:19.324,"He has no hard purpose for just any wet thigh, does he?"
00:03:19.449,00:03:21.994,He and his purpose are not my concern.
00:03:22.119,00:03:24.163,Fortunately the gods feel otherwise.
00:03:24.287,00:03:27.206,They shower him with more than rain and accolades...
00:03:27.332,00:03:31.628,They bless him with news to lift the heart higher than the clouds.
00:03:33.296,00:03:34.422,Sura?
00:03:34.548,00:03:35.841,Found!
00:03:35.966,00:03:37.176,In the dark corners of Syria.
00:03:37.300,00:03:38.177,Where...where is she?
00:03:39.178,00:03:40.387,Peace!
00:03:40.512,00:03:42.347,All will be revealed when a mouth closes!
00:03:42.472,00:03:46.060,"The Syrian Glaber spoke of sold her to a merchant, the sea his mistress."
00:03:46.185,00:03:48.395,He has recently docked on the shores of Neapolis.
00:03:48.520,00:03:49.354,On Roman soil?
00:03:51.648,00:03:53.067,"Two days ride from where you stand, barring incident."
00:03:53.192,00:03:54.068,When do we leave?
00:03:55.652,00:03:58.030,"My man already spurs his horse, Rest at ease."
00:03:58.155,00:04:00.490,She moves ever closer even as we speak.
00:04:06.621,00:04:09.290,You are an honorable man.
00:04:09.416,00:04:11.376,And will forever bear my gratitude.
00:04:11.501,00:04:13.503,As you bear mine.
00:04:13.628,00:04:16.965,Being reunited with your wife is but the first of many rewards.
00:04:18.842,00:04:20.677,Dominus.
00:04:27.768,00:04:29.061,Secrets.
00:04:30.478,00:04:32.647,Secrets upon secrets.
00:04:32.773,00:04:35.358,The news of her discovery only just reached me.
00:04:35.483,00:04:38.612,And what of good Ovidius and his family?
00:04:38.737,00:04:41.823,Why did you keep plans towards their slaughter from me?
00:04:42.991,00:04:45.244,And all to clear a few debts.
00:04:45.368,00:04:48.080,"It had nothing to do with debt, except one of blood."
00:04:48.205,00:04:50.540,His was the hand behind attempt on my life in the Pits.
00:04:51.250,00:04:52.500,Ovidius?
00:04:52.626,00:04:54.002,Moved to purpose by Solonius.
00:05:00.759,00:05:03.553,I would not have you stained by such things.
00:05:03.678,00:05:06.389,We are the toast of the fucking city.
00:05:06.514,00:05:08.349,Let us pause and enjoy it.
00:05:25.575,00:05:26.827,Yours alone.
00:05:27.744,00:05:29.537,Not to be shared?
00:05:29.663,00:05:32.040,Your achievement in earning it profound.
00:05:32.166,00:05:34.209,Made possible by your instruction.
00:05:34.334,00:05:36.377,My actions only set you to the task.
00:05:36.503,00:05:41.883,"By depriving Theokoles of his life, you put end to a battle left unfinished by my sword."
00:05:42.634,00:05:44.803,An end to my shame.
00:05:47.973,00:05:50.600,"I live to see my wife again, because of you."
00:05:51.977,00:05:54.479,A debt not soon forgotten.
00:05:54.604,00:05:56.648,There is no balance between us.
00:05:57.774,00:05:59.651,Only the promise of future glory.
00:06:04.739,00:06:05.991,Are candles permitted?
00:06:07.408,00:06:09.494,Sura was always fond of them.
00:06:10.662,00:06:13.540,You misunderstand.
00:06:13.665,00:06:15.625,This cell is for you alone.
00:06:15.750,00:06:17.418,Wives are not permitted to live among us.
00:06:17.544,00:06:19.546,Then where will she stay?
00:06:19.671,00:06:20.755,In the villa.
00:06:20.881,00:06:25.093,Kept safe and well in return for good service to the Domina.
00:06:25.219,00:06:26.761,As a slave.
00:06:26.887,00:06:28.096,As are we all.
00:06:29.681,00:06:33.476,"But you rise quickly, unlike any other I've ever witnessed."
00:06:33.601,00:06:35.896,"Continue your ascent, and you will gain freedom."
00:06:36.688,00:06:38.106,For both of you.
00:06:48.533,00:06:50.118,Ashur.
00:06:52.829,00:06:54.664,Barca!
00:06:54.789,00:06:56.166,I was this very moment coming to have words.
00:06:57.292,00:06:59.211,I would have coin instead.
00:06:59.336,00:07:02.381,"It is no small marvel, the fall of Theokoles."
00:07:02.505,00:07:07.344,"Your wager in the favor of the unexpected outcome, the size of the odds..."
00:07:07.468,00:07:09.971,"It's not a simple matter, to cover a win of such margin, eh?"
00:07:11.806,00:07:14.184,I give no shit for margins.
00:07:14.309,00:07:17.396,"Beg, steal, or kill to cover what is owed."
00:07:17.520,00:07:18.563,Or you will have two worthless legs.
00:07:42.421,00:07:44.714,I've had exchange with the cripple.
00:07:44.839,00:07:46.300,He pays what is owed?
00:07:46.425,00:07:47.508,Soon the coin will be in hand.
00:07:47.634,00:07:49.552,Enough to buy our freedom.
00:07:55.558,00:07:59.520,"Freedom, err...the word is foreign to the tongue."
00:08:01.940,00:08:03.566,What of the birds?
00:08:03.691,00:08:05.610,They will fly this place as we do.
00:08:05.735,00:08:07.612,I will see what clothes we have packed and ready.
00:08:09.614,00:08:12.617,Which direction shall we travel and how far?
00:08:12.742,00:08:14.202,As far as desire wills our feet.
00:08:17.456,00:08:19.582,This cloak.
00:08:19.707,00:08:21.626,It was the one you wore when you left.
00:08:21.751,00:08:23.295,When good Ovidius was murdered.
00:08:23.420,00:08:24.838,There was nothing good about him.
00:08:24.963,00:08:26.506,Then it was you who killed him?
00:08:26.631,00:08:27.799,All his slaves?
00:08:27.924,00:08:29.634,His family...
00:08:29.759,00:08:31.470,My hands did what they were commanded.
00:08:31.594,00:08:32.346,What of the young boy.
00:08:32.471,00:08:33.721,Ovidius' son.
00:08:33.847,00:08:35.390,Did they take his life too?
00:08:35.515,00:08:36.975,Such were my orders.
00:08:38.852,00:08:41.604,But you know of my affection for delicate things.
00:08:43.023,00:08:46.693,"The boy was spared, and set to wander far from the deed."
00:08:46.818,00:08:49.737,"By the time he is discovered, we will be free."
00:08:50.864,00:08:52.407,And your hands?
00:08:52.532,00:08:54.534,Clean forever more.
00:08:54.659,00:08:55.952,And yours to command...
00:09:34.366,00:09:39.413,Orders for my men flood in from every family with half a name and a little coin!
00:09:39.538,00:09:41.540,Prosperity beyond measure is within our reach!
00:09:41.664,00:09:44.667,As are those who would have you dead.
00:09:44.792,00:09:46.794,I will see Solonius pay for the grievance.
00:09:46.920,00:09:49.089,But these things are not be hurried.
00:09:50.549,00:09:56.179,I would savor every drop of sweat from his brow as my noose tightens upon his neck.
00:09:56.304,00:09:58.681,I would prefer it tighten quickly.
00:09:58.806,00:10:00.641,"Eh, everything to its season."
00:10:00.767,00:10:02.894,Turning towards more pressing matters.
00:10:03.019,00:10:06.189,Reuniting the Thracian with his wife?
00:10:06.314,00:10:08.358,Not the matter I was referring to.
00:10:09.901,00:10:14.114,Have the girl's ass a bit and I'll watch.
00:10:14.239,00:10:15.990,And I would give pleasure to your eyes...
00:10:30.880,00:10:33.258,The Thracian woman concerns me.
00:10:35.760,00:10:38.305,The promise of finding her was the only thing that kept him in check.
00:10:40.014,00:10:45.103,"What if her presence reverts him to his Thracian ways, and thoughts of defiance?"
00:10:45.228,00:10:46.687,It will not.
00:10:47.606,00:10:49.816,How can you be so sure?
00:10:49.941,00:10:52.777,Did you see the tears of gratitude in his eyes?
00:10:54.737,00:10:56.781,Gratitude falls short of loyalty.
00:10:58.992,00:11:01.328,He's not the man Crixus is.
00:11:01.453,00:11:06.082,"And Crixus is not the man he was, and may never be again."
00:11:07.750,00:11:10.086,Spartacus will be reunited with his wife.
00:11:12.130,00:11:13.672,And in the act...
00:11:13.798,00:11:17.427,I will bind him to us and this ludus...
00:11:17.552,00:11:21.264,Until god comes to claim us all...
00:11:47.790,00:11:49.209,How will you save us?
00:11:51.002,00:11:52.920,From the rain.
00:11:53.046,00:11:54.713,Your victory splits the skies.
00:11:54.839,00:11:57.008,How will you close them before we all drown?
00:11:57.133,00:11:59.093,"You believe the rest of the fools, then?"
00:11:59.219,00:12:00.719,That I am blessed by the gods?
00:12:00.845,00:12:03.181,Miracles do take habit of shooting out of your ass.
00:12:06.184,00:12:09.187,I've heard whispers of yet more divine providence.
00:12:09.979,00:12:10.897,Sura.
00:12:11.022,00:12:12.273,Is it true?
00:12:13.774,00:12:16.110,She speeds to my arms from Neapolis.
00:12:16.236,00:12:18.112,And still you doubt the god's favor you.
00:12:19.364,00:12:24.035,"If what Sura has been forced to endure is parcel of their favor, I would rather they turn their back on me."
00:12:24.160,00:12:24.994,If they exist at all.
00:12:25.119,00:12:27.664,She comes.
00:12:31.626,00:12:34.087,You once lived free in these lands.
00:12:34.212,00:12:37.006,From which way does she travel?
00:12:37.131,00:12:39.133,The port in Neapolis lies in that direction.
00:12:41.177,00:12:43.012,Are there roads to the mountains that lead east?
00:12:43.137,00:12:44.931,Several.
00:12:45.056,00:12:47.684,Which ones are the most sparsely traveled?
00:12:47.808,00:12:50.103,"An odd question, removed from the subject."
00:12:51.020,00:12:52.355,Not so far astray.
00:12:55.108,00:12:57.485,"Yes, some are sparsely traveled."
00:12:57.611,00:13:02.949,"But not to the point of the new Champion of Fucking Capua going unnoticed, if overcome by questionable thoughts."
00:13:03.074,00:13:06.953,How long do you think before Batiatus would allow me to buy our freedom?
00:13:07.078,00:13:09.497,How many years will she be condemned to bow and scrape?
00:13:09.623,00:13:10.789,Death the alternative?
00:13:10.915,00:13:13.627,"You move to escape beyond these walls, and that is surely what you'll find."
00:13:13.752,00:13:15.169,Has no one ever attempted such a thing?
00:13:15.295,00:13:16.045,And lived?
00:13:16.170,00:13:17.672,No.
00:13:17.796,00:13:19.549,It is a thing born of the impossible.
00:13:19.674,00:13:21.301,The same was said of defeating Theokoles.
00:13:22.260,00:13:23.970,"You have a plan, then?"
00:13:24.095,00:13:25.430,One begins to take shape...
00:14:13.978,00:14:15.062,I fear it malformed.
00:14:15.188,00:14:16.147,In what way?
00:14:16.272,00:14:18.191,"Weapons, to begin."
00:14:18.316,00:14:19.484,In large supply at a ludus.
00:14:19.609,00:14:21.653,"Ah, but kept by lock and key."
00:14:21.778,00:14:25.198,Or do you believe the gods will drop one from the sky along with the rain?
00:14:25.323,00:14:28.159,I believe in opportunity.
00:14:28.284,00:14:30.244,And the power of reason to seize upon it.
00:14:30.370,00:14:31.496,Fair enough.
00:14:31.621,00:14:32.831,Say you somehow reason up a weapon.
00:14:32.955,00:14:36.209,What of a horse?
00:14:36.334,00:14:38.211,Dominus provides one.
00:14:39.212,00:14:40.588,Sura arrives by cart...
00:14:53.017,00:14:55.144,Well it won't matter.
00:14:55.269,00:14:57.856,"Weapons, horses, they're the least of your concerns."
00:14:58.022,00:14:59.858,And the greatest?
00:14:59.982,00:15:01.984,The one man that could stop you...
00:15:45.403,00:15:46.404,I had not considered him.
00:15:46.529,00:15:48.281,You have not considered many things.
00:15:48.406,00:15:50.157,"Take pause, I beg of you."
00:15:50.283,00:15:52.159,No.
00:15:52.285,00:15:53.661,We will have our freedom.
00:15:55.079,00:15:57.331,"I will take her in my arms, and hear her speak my name."
00:15:58.082,00:15:59.834,My name.
00:15:59.959,00:16:02.086,Not the one the Romans branded me with.
00:16:02.211,00:16:03.337,I cannot help you in this.
00:16:03.463,00:16:04.130,I would not ask it.
00:16:04.255,00:16:05.924,If it weren't for my own family...
00:16:06.048,00:16:06.758,Give it no thought.
00:16:06.883,00:16:08.635,Is there nothing I can say to turn you from this path?
00:16:09.260,00:16:10.428,Nothing.
00:16:12.680,00:16:15.057,Then may the gods you don't believe in favor you.
00:16:58.017,00:16:59.268,"A fine figure, is he not?"
00:16:59.393,00:17:01.479,A god among men.
00:17:01.604,00:17:03.564,I've never beheld such magnificent armor.
00:17:07.234,00:17:11.572,"If you grant permission, I would wear it upon my wife's return."
00:17:11.698,00:17:13.115,A move to impress?
00:17:14.993,00:17:17.119,She will marvel at the sight.
00:17:45.356,00:17:47.400,A man must always appear his best in the eyes of love.
00:17:47.525,00:17:49.193,You may wear it.
00:17:49.318,00:17:52.530,And I will even stand by your side while you welcome her with your open arms.
00:17:52.655,00:17:54.448,"The swords, however..."
00:17:54.574,00:17:55.825,What need would I have of them?
00:18:00.120,00:18:01.372,Can it be?!
00:18:01.497,00:18:04.458,The legend himself among us?!
00:18:04.584,00:18:06.002,Magistrate Calavius!
00:18:06.126,00:18:07.294,Good fortune to see you.
00:18:07.420,00:18:09.047,"No, the good fortune is mine!"
00:18:09.171,00:18:14.385,My son Numerius cannot cease his talk of Spartacus and his victory over Theokoles.
00:18:14.510,00:18:19.265,He demanded a trip to market to obtain something of Thrace in your man's honor.
00:18:19.390,00:18:20.725,Show him.
00:18:23.394,00:18:24.896,The merchant said it was a warrior's weapon.
00:18:30.026,00:18:31.611,As well it is.
00:18:33.780,00:18:35.364,See these marks?
00:18:36.991,00:18:38.618,Thracians notch their hilts.
00:18:38.743,00:18:40.411,One for every kill.
00:18:42.329,00:18:45.207,How many made to yours after slaying Theokoles?
00:18:45.332,00:18:48.628,He must have been worth ten at least!
00:18:48.753,00:18:51.255,If I could wield a sword half as well you...
00:18:54.092,00:19:01.641,Join us at my master's ludus and I will teach you the blow that brought death to the Shadow.
00:19:01.766,00:19:03.267,A splendid notion!
00:19:06.687,00:19:09.398,Perhaps a visit later this afternoon.
00:19:09.523,00:19:11.317,Why make the boy suffer with anticipation?
00:19:11.442,00:19:13.111,Join us presently.
00:19:13.235,00:19:15.321,Joy must be delayed in favor of sorrow.
00:19:15.446,00:19:17.949,I attend to matters relating my cousin's murder.
00:19:18.950,00:19:20.326,Good Ovidius.
00:19:20.451,00:19:23.203,The heart constricts at the thought.
00:19:23.329,00:19:25.414,But swells with promise of vengeance.
00:19:26.833,00:19:28.126,Numerius! Come!
00:19:28.250,00:19:31.629,Your generous hospitality will be appreciated shortly.
00:19:39.261,00:19:41.806,An invitation to school the Magistrate's son?
00:19:45.559,00:19:47.186,Fuck apologies!
00:19:47.311,00:19:49.897,"Shrewd maneuvering, if ever I saw it!"
00:19:50.023,00:19:51.649,I'll make a Roman of you yet!
00:20:02.284,00:20:05.079,Should his eyes not be open?
00:20:05.204,00:20:07.331,Calm is needed to heal the wound.
00:20:07.456,00:20:08.958,I keep him at rest with herb.
00:20:09.083,00:20:10.584,He will recover?
00:20:10.710,00:20:12.336,I've done what I can.
00:20:12.461,00:20:14.380,It rests in the hands of the gods.
00:20:14.505,00:20:16.215,No.
00:20:16.340,00:20:19.301,His life now rests in your hands.
00:20:19.426,00:20:23.556,And I will see them parted from your fucking body if he dies.
00:20:28.061,00:20:29.729,See how they all look at you?
00:20:30.980,00:20:34.942,"My father had many champions, but none to rival the great Spartacus!"
00:20:36.694,00:20:41.365,You can almost smell the coins dropping into our purse.
00:20:42.491,00:20:46.328,"If I may, what remains of my own coin, after Sura's transport?"
00:20:46.453,00:20:48.372,You wish to buy something for your wife?
00:20:48.497,00:20:52.210,"This market is for proper Romans, it would not suit a slave."
00:20:52.334,00:20:53.878,"I ask not for me, but for the men."
00:20:55.588,00:20:59.425,"Wine and women, in celebration of my victory."
00:20:59.550,00:21:03.221,"A noble gesture, to be much appreciated."
00:21:03.345,00:21:06.057,"You pay with your own coin, yet their happiness is a benefit to me."
00:21:07.683,00:21:09.852,"Very well, let it be done."
00:21:09.977,00:21:12.438,"Ah, Marcellus is of sound choice towards the vice."
00:21:12.563,00:21:13.898,Shall I make arrangement?
00:21:17.568,00:21:19.486,See that there is ample remainder.
00:21:19.612,00:21:21.530,Dominus.
00:21:39.090,00:21:40.507,"More threats then, is it?"
00:21:40.633,00:21:41.926,No.
00:21:45.596,00:21:47.932,Enough to wet tongue and cock for my master's men.
00:21:51.560,00:21:56.857,"And a large matter of debt to the gladiator Barca, that I would ask assistance with..."
00:22:04.323,00:22:05.825,I have no hand for this.
00:22:09.996,00:22:11.205,Your belt and adornments.
00:22:11.330,00:22:13.207,They hinder your purpose.
00:22:13.332,00:22:15.542,Your armor is heavy and yet you move swiftly.
00:22:15.668,00:22:17.503,"In time, so will you."
00:22:17.628,00:22:21.799,But a true warrior needs only a sword to cleave his fate.
00:22:29.556,00:22:30.683,I see your meaning.
00:22:30.808,00:22:33.019,Let us go again.
00:22:44.613,00:22:47.283,Apologies for our late arrival.
00:22:49.451,00:22:50.661,overwhelming.
00:22:51.495,00:22:53.289,How did you fare?
00:22:53.413,00:22:57.126,As expected when walking on dead relatives.
00:22:57.251,00:22:59.377,Your son is a quick study with the sword.
00:22:59.503,00:23:01.922,Born of a fascination with gladiators.
00:23:03.883,00:23:10.597,"His fifteenth birthday approaches, my ears are assaulted with request for a pair to show demonstration at his party."
00:23:10.723,00:23:17.771,"I had thought to engage Solonius' men, but his wares have Fallen out of fashion since your victory over Theokoles."
00:23:17.897,00:23:20.233,It seems your son has a taste for what is in favor.
00:23:20.358,00:23:21.775,And I would see him well fed.
00:23:21.901,00:23:24.320,Come. Let us negotiate a price for the meal.
00:23:24.444,00:23:26.739,"Begging pardon, Dominus."
00:23:26.864,00:23:28.532,I bring word of great import to Magistrate Calavius.
00:23:28.657,00:23:31.535,"An important man, seldom out of reach of public matters!"
00:23:34.747,00:23:38.584,"Ah, this message strikes more personal."
00:23:38.709,00:23:40.878,Ovidius' boy yet lives!
00:23:42.420,00:23:44.882,Well this is fantastic.
00:23:45.674,00:23:46.466,By Jupiter's blessing.
00:23:46.592,00:23:50.346,"He was discovered miles north of Capua, wandering the road!"
00:23:50.470,00:23:51.471,What of his words?
00:23:51.597,00:23:52.723,Does he describe the horrors?
00:23:52.848,00:23:53.724,How he came to survive.
00:23:53.849,00:23:54.808,Details not yet clear.
00:23:54.934,00:23:56.602,"Numerius, come!"
00:24:05.652,00:24:06.612,It was an honor.
00:24:06.737,00:24:08.864,Numerius!
00:24:23.379,00:24:25.089,How can the boy still be alive?
00:24:25.214,00:24:26.590,He could not.
00:24:26.715,00:24:27.674,Your eyes held his death?
00:24:27.800,00:24:29.551,No.
00:24:29.676,00:24:31.887,I left the deed in Barca's hands.
00:24:32.012,00:24:33.931,And our lives as well.
00:24:34.765,00:24:36.600,What are we going to do?
00:24:36.725,00:24:37.601,Fuck. Think!
00:24:39.603,00:24:41.688,Provision for the celebration arrive.
00:24:41.814,00:24:43.441,Cunt with celebration!
00:24:43.565,00:24:48.862,We are betrayed by The Beast of fucking Carthage and you bray about wine and whores!
00:24:49.487,00:24:50.656,Barca?
00:24:50.781,00:24:51.824,Yeah.
00:24:51.949,00:24:53.617,The man has always been loyal.
00:24:53.742,00:24:55.202,As a snake to the breast.
00:24:55.328,00:24:57.746,The son of Ovidius lives.
00:24:57.871,00:24:59.581,Unfortunate news.
00:25:00.833,00:25:02.960,Would the boy know your face?
00:25:03.085,00:25:05.296,No I was in shadow.
00:25:05.421,00:25:07.131,But Barca was clearly revealed.
00:25:08.882,00:25:10.926,I cannot believe Barca would betray you.
00:25:13.637,00:25:15.139,And yet...
00:25:16.849,00:25:20.019,"If you have knowledge, bring it to light."
00:25:21.854,00:25:25.899,"Barca placed a wager against Theokoles, winning sizeable coin."
00:25:26.025,00:25:30.779,I overheard him whisper to Pietros intentions to buy their freedom with it.
00:25:30.904,00:25:34.532,Barca has never mentioned desire to leave these walls.
00:25:34.658,00:25:37.495,He seeks to fly before discovery.
00:25:37.619,00:25:41.248,"If the child is allowed to look upon his face, he will be known as your man."
00:25:41.374,00:25:44.710,Gather proper guard and return with Barca. I would hear truth spilled from his mouth.
00:25:44.835,00:25:48.546,"When a man is pressed, lies flow with greater ease."
00:25:48.672,00:25:50.383,End him and be done with it.
00:25:50.508,00:25:54.345,"Not before I look into his eyes, and see if treachery lurks there."
00:25:55.721,00:25:57.848,Perhaps there is another path to illumination.
00:25:59.725,00:26:03.020,One traveled by more delicate sensibilities....
00:26:25.667,00:26:28.921,Tomorrow the men will be slow from drink.
00:26:29.046,00:26:31.215,And half the guards with them.
00:26:35.719,00:26:40.598,There is one that does not partake in your joyous offerings...
00:26:40.724,00:26:44.853,"A man of higher principle, not so easily distracted."
00:26:47.022,00:26:48.982,How does Crixus fare?
00:26:49.108,00:26:51.777,Adrift in the land of dreams.
00:26:51.902,00:26:54.905,"Kept there yet by the Medicus, in hope of recovery."
00:26:58.158,00:26:59.910,I would pay my respects.
00:27:09.669,00:27:11.213,In more than just wine...
00:27:14.716,00:27:17.261,Pietros.
00:27:34.027,00:27:35.988,What are you doing?
00:27:37.697,00:27:41.659,I come to share drink with my partner in victory!
00:27:41.785,00:27:44.455,"Well, pay your respects and be gone, he needs rest."
00:27:45.872,00:27:47.707,And keep that fucking wine from his lips.
00:27:57.926,00:28:04.391,"Without you, brother, my blood would have fallen in the arena instead of the rain!"
00:28:04.517,00:28:09.146,"May the gods forever honor Crixus, the Undefeated Gaul!"
00:28:16.654,00:28:18.197,And forgive the pain I cause.
00:28:25.663,00:28:27.164,Move aside!
00:28:28.706,00:28:29.875,His wound has reopened.
00:28:30.000,00:28:30.876,The brown jar!
00:28:31.001,00:28:32.169,Quickly!
00:28:33.003,00:28:34.004,Will this heal him?
00:28:34.129,00:28:36.798,No.
00:28:36.923,00:28:38.133,But it will calm him to sleep so that I may seal the wound.
00:28:43.930,00:28:46.058,Will he be all right?
00:28:46.183,00:28:47.518,Get the fuck out!
00:29:01.365,00:29:02.700,I've had too much wine already...
00:29:02.824,00:29:03.325,None of worth.
00:29:03.450,00:29:06.495,"This is Falernian, none of that swill flowing below us."
00:29:09.915,00:29:13.001,"Um, it truly tastes of the gods."
00:29:13.126,00:29:14.878,And brings us closer to them.
00:29:17.130,00:29:18.674,How fares Barca?
00:29:18.798,00:29:21.218,"In fine spirits, as are all the men."
00:29:21.343,00:29:22.969,Is your confidence to be trusted?
00:29:23.095,00:29:25.556,"Yes, of course Dominus."
00:29:25.681,00:29:30.894,"Several days ago, I was forced to take retribution against Ovidius, the grain merchant."
00:29:31.019,00:29:33.021,He had made attempt on my life in the Pits.
00:29:33.146,00:29:35.941,"The man was a danger and not to be trusted, he had to be handled accordingly."
00:29:36.066,00:29:37.859,You understand?
00:29:37.984,00:29:40.237,Now rumors abounds that more than Ovidius gave up their lives.
00:29:40.362,00:29:43.240,"His entire family, slain."
00:29:44.991,00:29:46.243,The rest I can put from mind.
00:29:46.368,00:29:49.288,"But the boy, he troubles my conscience."
00:29:49.413,00:29:51.498,If Barca exceeded my orders and laid hand to such an act...
00:29:51.624,00:29:53.250,"No, he didn't kill the boy."
00:29:55.377,00:29:57.254,Perhaps you only tell me what I wish to hear.
00:29:57.379,00:29:58.171,"No, no, no."
00:29:59.423,00:30:01.341,He swore he'd never harm a child.
00:30:04.052,00:30:07.097,Well this gives reason to put conscience to rest.
00:30:07.222,00:30:09.224,He'll be so pleased to know it.
00:30:09.349,00:30:11.602,We'll keep it from him yet a while.
00:30:15.021,00:30:17.023,"Yes, Dominus."
00:30:17.149,00:30:18.525,"Thank you for your honesty, Pietros."
00:30:29.662,00:30:31.913,The true nature of the man is revealed.
00:30:33.039,00:30:35.208,I would not have thought it of him.
00:30:37.252,00:30:39.797,Let Barca hoist his cup a while.
00:30:39.921,00:30:44.050,When his wits are damp with wine then I will see him rewarded for his loyalty.
00:30:45.177,00:30:46.345,Dominus.
00:31:20.170,00:31:22.130,You smell of wine.
00:31:22.255,00:31:25.384,"I bring cups, full of celebration."
00:31:26.176,00:31:28.053,I honor your victory.
00:31:28.762,00:31:30.055,With prayer.
00:31:32.140,00:31:36.061,Your instruction made possible reunion with my wife.
00:31:36.186,00:31:39.064,I would raise cups in gratitude.
00:31:39.189,00:31:41.316,The sentiment is well received.
00:31:41.441,00:31:44.069,But wine has not passed my lips for many years.
00:31:45.195,00:31:46.697,Your gods forbid it?
00:31:46.822,00:31:48.031,No.
00:31:52.536,00:31:54.162,It is a matter of discipline.
00:31:57.082,00:31:59.292,Sura always cautioned toward the same.
00:31:59.418,00:32:00.711,A wise woman.
00:32:02.045,00:32:04.256,Far beyond the station of her husband.
00:32:05.924,00:32:07.467,If she had not come into my life...
00:32:07.593,00:32:09.302,And now she returns.
00:32:10.512,00:32:12.055,The gods have truly blessed you.
00:32:13.056,00:32:14.307,Sura would say the same.
00:32:15.893,00:32:17.102,And you?
00:32:17.227,00:32:19.730,The gods and I do not tread common ground.
00:32:19.855,00:32:25.235,Although she made effort many times to place us at even footing.
00:32:25.360,00:32:27.237,Wise and understanding.
00:32:27.362,00:32:29.782,To love a man despite his shortcomings...
00:32:29.907,00:32:32.492,She is the only reason my heart beats within my chest.
00:32:32.618,00:32:34.286,To find love such as this...
00:32:36.622,00:32:38.415,A rare and fortunate thing.
00:32:40.208,00:32:42.001,You speak from knowledge?
00:32:44.045,00:32:45.464,A wife of my own.
00:32:47.048,00:32:49.092,The thought of her ever upon my mind.
00:32:51.511,00:32:53.472,Does she live?
00:32:57.434,00:32:58.644,In memory.
00:33:02.105,00:33:04.983,I would have desired to meet her.
00:33:05.108,00:33:07.277,And tell her of her husband's worth.
00:33:12.157,00:33:14.326,Apologies for disturbing your prayers.
00:33:15.410,00:33:16.787,Spartacus.
00:33:23.961,00:33:25.295,I cannot drink to victory.
00:33:35.305,00:33:37.182,Discipline gives way to the moment.
00:33:38.433,00:33:40.143,You honor us.
00:34:25.313,00:34:27.440,"Wow, what did the Dominus require?"
00:34:27.566,00:34:29.192,Nothing of import...
00:34:31.486,00:34:33.530,You kiss with purpose.
00:34:33.655,00:34:35.782,For the thought of freedom...
00:34:45.124,00:34:46.626,"A word, if I may."
00:34:46.752,00:34:49.880,"Fuck your words, unless coupled with coin."
00:34:50.005,00:34:51.882,The very matter I came to discuss.
00:34:52.007,00:34:55.301,"I've secured a sizeable loan from good Marcellus, to cover your winnings."
00:34:57.345,00:34:59.556,Give it here.
00:34:59.681,00:35:02.392,"Marcellus will bring it when he collects his whore, in the morning."
00:35:04.603,00:35:07.439,You interrupt my cock with empty hands?
00:35:07.564,00:35:08.565,And intelligence.
00:35:08.690,00:35:13.403,"Batiatus knows of your desire for freedom, and makes noise for discussing terms."
00:35:13.528,00:35:20.326,"Your skills, while impressive in the arena, lack a certain gentle touch in the art of negotiation."
00:35:20.452,00:35:25.457,I can offer to bargain a better price from Batiatus for your release.
00:35:25.582,00:35:27.250,Half the difference to be subtracted from my debt to you.
00:35:28.752,00:35:30.295,Batiatus is in agreeable spirits.
00:35:30.420,00:35:31.755,If we move with haste...
00:35:32.589,00:35:35.174,Go.
00:35:35.300,00:35:39.220,"Lets go and call him Dominus, for the final time."
00:36:01.200,00:36:04.788,I hear whispers you seek freedom.
00:36:06.414,00:36:09.668,Ashur represents me in the discussion.
00:36:11.419,00:36:13.421,Discussion?
00:36:13.546,00:36:15.465,There's none to be had in the matter.
00:36:15.590,00:36:17.968,The bond between master and slave has already been dissolved...
00:36:23.264,00:36:24.766,the moment you disobeyed me.
00:36:29.395,00:36:31.314,The son of Ovidius lives.
00:36:38.155,00:36:39.322,Impossible.
00:36:39.447,00:36:41.199,The Magistrate rides to retrieve him.
00:36:41.324,00:36:46.955,"Yet breathing, small fingers trembling to reveal the beast that took away his family."
00:36:47.080,00:36:48.331,This cannot be.
00:36:48.456,00:36:52.418,"My hands upon his throat, I felt the life flee from his body."
00:36:55.463,00:36:57.298,Your lover spoke otherwise.
00:36:59.634,00:37:00.802,Pietros?
00:37:02.387,00:37:03.346,You told him the boy lives.
00:37:03.471,00:37:04.764,Did you not?
00:37:05.515,00:37:07.225,I did.
00:37:07.350,00:37:09.519,But only to calm him.
00:37:09.644,00:37:12.313,If he knew the child's blood stained my hands...
00:37:12.438,00:37:14.524,So you lied to him?
00:37:21.280,00:37:24.784,"Either way, we've a serious issue of trust."
00:37:28.287,00:37:30.498,"Dominus, let me expl..."
00:37:37.547,00:37:38.840,"Well, stop him!"
00:39:09.597,00:39:11.390,Now you're free.
00:40:28.509,00:40:31.137,Barca purchased his freedom.
00:40:31.263,00:40:34.557,We wished him well and escorted him through the gates of the villa.
00:40:34.682,00:40:35.934,Do you understand?
00:40:37.476,00:40:38.644,"Yes, Domina."
00:40:38.770,00:40:40.646,Do you understand?
00:40:40.772,00:40:41.522,Yes!
00:40:41.647,00:40:43.942,Open up.
00:40:45.651,00:40:47.028,Juno's cunt!
00:40:47.153,00:40:48.321,What now?!
00:40:48.446,00:40:50.656,Make way for the Magistrate.
00:40:50.782,00:40:51.741,Fuck!?
00:40:51.866,00:40:53.243,Close the curtains!
00:40:53.368,00:40:55.245,"Santos clean the blood up in there, get it cleaned up!"
00:40:55.370,00:40:56.746,Make way!
00:40:57.330,00:40:58.581,Batiatus!
00:40:58.706,00:41:00.250,Magistrate.
00:41:00.375,00:41:02.043,You call at unexpected hour.
00:41:02.168,00:41:04.712,Drawn by matters that will not wait for dawn.
00:41:04.837,00:41:07.882,What new offense is this?
00:41:08.007,00:41:09.342,"Ah, nothing."
00:41:09.467,00:41:11.761,"A disobedient slave, freshly corrected."
00:41:11.886,00:41:14.764,Not the only wretch deserving of blood this night.
00:41:14.889,00:41:22.647,"I have just now returned from the promised reunion with Ovidius' son, and would have words with a man seen in your house."
00:41:22.772,00:41:24.732,Which man do you speak of?
00:41:24.857,00:41:27.277,The messenger that filled my heart with false hope.
00:41:28.653,00:41:30.571,Messenger?
00:41:30.696,00:41:33.283,Ovidius' child was not seen on any road.
00:41:40.081,00:41:42.459,The messenger lied...
00:41:42.583,00:41:46.212,"I will have knowledge of the reason, along with the fool's tongue."
00:41:46.338,00:41:49.048,Every effort will be exhausted until the villain is discovered.
00:41:54.053,00:41:55.554,Coin.
00:41:55.680,00:41:57.098,Paired with gratitude.
00:41:57.223,00:41:59.517,"The messenger had the desired effect, then?"
00:41:59.642,00:42:04.147,"My concerns have been laid to rest, sharing grave with Barca and his thirst for winnings."
00:42:08.485,00:42:12.238,There's no chance the Magistrate will deduce the source of this message?
00:42:12.364,00:42:14.615,Not unless Hades speaks of it from the underworld.
00:42:14.740,00:42:15.783,Um.
00:42:15.908,00:42:18.577,The messenger has been put to grass.
00:42:18.703,00:42:23.666,"And you will follow, if a word of this transaction parts your lips again."
00:42:33.092,00:42:35.178,I shit myself.
00:42:36.971,00:42:38.806,Ashur?
00:42:38.931,00:42:40.392,Ashur.
00:42:40.517,00:42:41.726,Young Pietros!
00:42:41.851,00:42:42.685,How does the day find you?
00:42:42.810,00:42:44.229,"As the night, filled with worry."
00:42:44.354,00:42:45.397,Barca never returned.
00:42:45.522,00:42:46.398,Nor will he.
00:42:46.523,00:42:47.399,He has his freedom.
00:42:47.524,00:42:48.274,Freedom?
00:42:48.400,00:42:49.275,Yes.
00:42:49.401,00:42:53.196,Purchased from our Dominus.
00:42:54.697,00:42:57.242,He was to take me with him.
00:42:57.367,00:42:59.869,The price of freedom was too steep for the both of you.
00:42:59.994,00:43:02.330,But do not worry.
00:43:05.542,00:43:07.960,One he doesn't have to pay for.
00:43:30.275,00:43:32.485,"Jupiter's cock, my head."
00:43:32.610,00:43:35.029,I can barely stand for want of vomit.
00:43:39.534,00:43:42.454,No one in condition to halt a man of purpose.
00:43:42.579,00:43:44.581,Such by design.
00:43:44.705,00:43:47.708,"Doctores usually up before the sun, whip in hand."
00:43:49.001,00:43:50.002,Will he ever rise again?
00:43:50.128,00:43:52.004,He will.
00:43:52.130,00:43:53.131,But not for many hours.
00:43:53.256,00:43:55.049,"Oh, your chances improve, then."
00:43:56.217,00:43:57.843,To the point of certainty.
00:43:57.969,00:44:00.263,Nothing is ever so.
00:44:00.388,00:44:03.141,"Look even if you ride beyond the gates, the guards will pursue."
00:44:03.266,00:44:05.268,They will be commanded against such action.
00:44:07.019,00:44:08.854,You actually expect them to obey you?
00:44:08.980,00:44:09.981,No.
00:44:10.106,00:44:12.066,I expect them to obey their master...
00:44:16.279,00:44:19.491,Drop your fucking swords!
00:44:19.616,00:44:22.034,Do it!
00:44:22.160,00:44:24.787,I will release him when we are in the cover of the mountains.
00:44:24.912,00:44:27.039,Spartacus!
00:44:27.165,00:44:28.749,Your wife's cart appears upon the road!
00:44:28.874,00:44:31.794,I'll be with you presently!
00:44:31.919,00:44:34.464,I urge you to reconsider one last time.
00:44:35.632,00:44:38.009,Sura will be free.
00:44:38.134,00:44:43.431,"In this life, or the one after, with her husband by her side."
00:44:47.477,00:44:50.938,May the gods see you both upon the plains of Thrace.
00:45:14.212,00:45:15.588,The pool is clear.
00:45:15.712,00:45:18.508,As if it never happened.
00:45:18.633,00:45:20.176,A regrettable misunderstanding.
00:45:21.052,00:45:22.428,The man was yet loyal.
00:45:23.971,00:45:25.473,He wished for his freedom.
00:45:26.349,00:45:28.267,A betrayal in itself.
00:45:31.103,00:45:33.064,Come.
00:45:33.189,00:45:35.024,The Thracian's wife approaches.
00:45:35.149,00:45:37.569,How is that cause for cheer?
00:45:37.694,00:45:41.030,"Her arrival will only remind him of his old life, and the ways of an animal."
00:45:41.155,00:45:42.532,Why can't you see that?
00:45:42.657,00:45:44.783,Our hopes and fortunes are tied to Spartacus.
00:45:44.909,00:45:47.078,I made a promise to reunite him with his wife.
00:45:47.203,00:45:49.955,"In honor of the man, I will keep my word."
00:49:01.689,00:49:05.109,They came out of nowhere...
00:49:05.234,00:49:09.280,they attacked...
00:50:55.177,00:50:57.095,I'm here.
00:51:30.671,00:51:32.214,My word is kept.
00:51:34.132,00:51:35.593,They're reunited.
00:01:56.075,00:01:57.492,Yes!
00:02:04.124,00:02:08.587,"Spartacus, Victor again!"
00:02:17.387,00:02:19.681,It's a marvel good Solonius has any men left!
00:02:21.934,00:02:24.561,Must the Thracian appear in every primus?
00:02:24.561,00:02:28.023,Does the House of Batiatus not deem another gladiator worthy of spectacle?
00:02:28.023,00:02:29.817,They have no one else of note.
00:02:29.817,00:02:32.360,"Crixus will return to glory, presently."
00:02:32.360,00:02:33.320,As you say.
00:02:33.320,00:02:34.571,A welcome addition.
00:02:36.782,00:02:40.119,I grow tried of this Thracian and his victories.
00:02:40.119,00:02:43.122,Perhaps something of note to erase the tedium.
00:02:45.082,00:02:50.253,"I purchase a fresh batch of slaves at auction tomorrow, to be trained as gladiators."
00:02:54.341,00:02:58.095,What sort of beasts shall you procure?
00:02:58.095,00:03:02.349,"Only the most ferocious, to be displayed for your pleasure."
00:03:12.901,00:03:15.904,Our next auction is about to begin.
00:03:19.074,00:03:20.951,Fortune favors us!
00:03:20.951,00:03:23.871,"A fine selection, enough coin to take our pick."
00:03:23.871,00:03:26.665,Your competitor approaches.
00:03:28.249,00:03:31.419,"Solonius, my heart brims with joy!"
00:03:31.419,00:03:35.507,"I had hoped to see you here, buying new men for Spartacus to slaughter!"
00:03:35.507,00:03:40.137,"Batiatus, now purse-proud and so potent with charm."
00:03:40.137,00:03:43.306,How quickly Fortuna shifts her blessings. Huh?
00:03:43.306,00:03:46.185,A fact that beloved Ovidius was unexpectedly made aware.
00:03:47.978,00:03:49.188,His murder was a deep tragedy.
00:03:49.188,00:03:51.690,Indeed.
00:03:51.690,00:03:53.901,"One can never know who is plotting violence, can one?"
00:03:53.901,00:03:55.235,Or when they may commit the act.
00:03:55.235,00:03:57.320,Good citizens of Capua.
00:03:57.320,00:03:58.363,"The auction begins, Dominus."
00:03:58.363,00:04:00.115,"To business, then."
00:04:00.115,00:04:01.825,Behold the finest offering of flesh and bone...
00:04:01.825,00:04:05.370,The Gaul Segovax will demand expense.
00:04:05.370,00:04:09.541,"And perhaps the German brothers, Duro and Agron."
00:04:11.376,00:04:12.961,of little worth.
00:04:12.961,00:04:18.842,Let us begin with a Celtic Gaul of imposing virtues!
00:04:18.842,00:04:20.301,I give you !
00:04:20.301,00:04:21.678,"Segovax, an imposing Gaul, is pulled forward."
00:04:21.678,00:04:24.056,"Skin, his armor!"
00:04:24.056,00:04:26.558,"Hands, his steel!"
00:04:26.558,00:04:29.436,Who would claim such a man?!
00:04:29.436,00:04:31.146,Bid!
00:04:32.313,00:04:34.191,Five denari from good Vibius!
00:04:35.358,00:04:36.359,Twelve!
00:04:36.359,00:04:39.320,Fifteen!
00:04:39.320,00:04:40.822,Twenty!
00:04:42.532,00:04:45.953,Twenty-five denarii!
00:04:45.953,00:04:48.371,I grow tired of bidding.
00:04:48.371,00:04:49.915,a hundred denarii!!
00:04:52.918,00:04:54.169,A hundred?
00:04:55.336,00:04:56.379,Sold!
00:04:56.379,00:04:57.798,To Batiatus!
00:04:57.798,00:04:59.299,Savior of Capua!
00:05:02.469,00:05:07.891,"With respect Dominus, your coin far exceeds their value."
00:05:07.891,00:05:09.434,Fuck value!
00:05:09.434,00:05:13.354,None can be placed on seeing that cock eater's pride ground beneath my heel.
00:05:14.273,00:05:18.401,"Solonius, Consider the whores!"
00:05:18.401,00:05:22.156,Perhaps you will have better fortune fighting women in the arena!
00:05:54.521,00:05:56.315,"Have I not pleased you, Domina?"
00:05:58.233,00:06:00.359,Does your cock stand dry?
00:06:03.655,00:06:07.450,I fear you have not quaked.
00:06:07.450,00:06:08.702,Apologies.
00:06:11.246,00:06:13.915,My wounds have yet to fully heal.
00:06:13.915,00:06:16.501,Well you will recover and all will be as it was.
00:06:19.378,00:06:21.340,Forgive me.
00:06:21.340,00:06:23.550,Dominus returns from the market.
00:06:26.094,00:06:27.512,Get out.
00:06:32.684,00:06:35.103,What would you have me do?
00:06:35.103,00:06:38.857,"If I refuse, Domina will grow suspicious."
00:06:38.857,00:06:40.525,I know.
00:06:43.778,00:06:48.491,"I perform as weakly as I can, hoping she will lose interest."
00:06:50.409,00:06:51.661,I am not angry with you.
00:06:53.330,00:06:56.457,It's only...
00:06:57.500,00:07:02.964,I find it difficult that you and Domina share what we have not.
00:07:02.964,00:07:05.424,For some time.
00:07:10.972,00:07:13.350,You alone occupy my thoughts.
00:07:31.576,00:07:32.827,You're gonna die!
00:07:32.827,00:07:34.079,You're gonna die!
00:07:35.455,00:07:37.332,I'm gonna kill you.
00:07:37.332,00:07:38.583,You're dead.
00:07:40.252,00:07:43.713,"You're dead, you're dead, now you're dead, You're all dead."
00:08:04.818,00:08:06.069,What is beneath your feet?
00:08:09.489,00:08:10.615,Sand?
00:08:12.451,00:08:14.702,Fucking idiot.
00:08:20.000,00:08:22.377,"Sacred ground, Doctore!"
00:08:22.377,00:08:25.172,Watered with tears of blood!
00:08:25.172,00:08:26.340,Your tears.
00:08:27.382,00:08:29.259,Your blood.
00:08:29.259,00:08:31.552,"Your pathetic lives, forged into something of worth..."
00:08:31.552,00:08:33.096,Five denarii on the fool who spoke.
00:08:33.096,00:08:34.348,Listen. Learn.
00:08:35.474,00:08:37.058,"And perhaps, live."
00:08:37.058,00:08:39.186,As gladiators.
00:08:39.186,00:08:43.398,"Now, attend your master!"
00:08:43.398,00:08:45.317,You have been blessed!
00:08:45.317,00:08:56.661,"Each and every one of you, to find yourselves here, at the ludus of Quintus Lentulus Purveyor of the finest in all of the Republic!"
00:08:58.913,00:09:02.334,"Prove yourselves, in the hard days to follow."
00:09:02.334,00:09:05.628,Prove yourselves more than a common slave.
00:09:05.628,00:09:07.297,More than a man.
00:09:07.297,00:09:09.966,Your husband speaks as my father would before the senate.
00:09:09.966,00:09:11.634,He's quite the orator.
00:09:11.634,00:09:13.261,The tongue of Apollo.
00:09:14.762,00:09:18.475,"Succeed, and stand proud among my titans!"
00:09:19.851,00:09:22.645,"Batiatus, Batiatus, Batiatus!"
00:09:26.233,00:09:29.236,A Gladiator does not fear death.
00:09:30.487,00:09:32.447,He embraces it.
00:09:32.447,00:09:33.823,Caresses it.
00:09:33.823,00:09:36.410,Fucks it..
00:09:36.410,00:09:38.036,What make you of the new men?
00:09:39.746,00:09:43.417,They are spectacles!
00:09:43.417,00:09:49.214,I find myself growing quite fond of this sordid business of gladiators.
00:09:49.214,00:09:51.591,Perhaps you should consider purchasing one of your own.
00:09:51.591,00:09:53.510,A gladiator?
00:09:53.510,00:09:54.928,I could never.
00:09:59.391,00:10:00.975,Could I?
00:10:00.975,00:10:04.229,"Choose a recruit, and he is yours, for a nominal fee, of course."
00:10:04.229,00:10:08.733,Such funds to cover the expense of his upkeep and his training.
00:10:08.733,00:10:12.612,"Every victory in the arena, is an honor to his Domina."
00:10:17.451,00:10:20.995,Who should I choose?!
00:10:20.995,00:10:23.039,May I offer a suggestion to aid your dilemma?
00:10:24.458,00:10:25.708,Doctore!
00:10:27.419,00:10:31.714,Our honored guest wishes to access the recruits' virtues.
00:10:36.219,00:10:37.804,Remove your cloths!
00:11:06.040,00:11:08.418,I wish to alter my bet.
00:11:08.418,00:11:11.212,Everything on the one with the horse cock.
00:11:12.339,00:11:14.673,The one on the left...
00:11:14.673,00:11:17.135,"Segovax, Gaul."
00:11:17.135,00:11:21.722,He has truly been blessed by the god Priapus.
00:11:21.722,00:11:24.559,A fine specimen!
00:11:24.559,00:11:26.353,We must celebrate!
00:11:28.605,00:11:29.856,See to the wine.
00:11:31.024,00:11:32.859,Has a man ever had such a wife?
00:11:32.859,00:11:35.529,"She but loves her husband, and would see him elevated."
00:11:38.739,00:11:44.663,"A gladiator of my own, mined from the same lands as Crixus!"
00:11:50.043,00:11:52.212,Who would you torture so?
00:11:52.212,00:11:54.548,"No one of my acquaintance, I hope."
00:11:54.548,00:11:55.882,Doubtful.
00:11:55.882,00:11:59.219,"Caecila, Aemilia..."
00:11:59.219,00:12:01.429,Licinia.
00:12:01.429,00:12:03.431,"Licinia, Cousin to Marcus Crassus?"
00:12:03.431,00:12:06.767,"The wealthiest man in Rome, according to him, at least."
00:12:06.767,00:12:10.104,"Licinia, in particular enjoys the games."
00:12:12.357,00:12:15.068,You must make invitation for private introduction to your man Segovax.
00:12:15.068,00:12:16.528,Here at the villa.
00:12:16.528,00:12:18.655,"Uh, these are proper Roman women."
00:12:18.655,00:12:20.739,They only mingle with families of equal standing.
00:12:22.741,00:12:24.827,"Oh, perhaps it's for the best."
00:12:24.827,00:12:28.164,Seeing your man in the flesh would only inflame their envy.
00:12:39.133,00:12:42.011,We must make you look suitable for such elevated company.
00:12:48.101,00:12:51.770,Shit baking in the sun.
00:12:51.770,00:12:54.608,Seems only yesterday we were of a similar position.
00:12:57.776,00:13:00.697,You became the fucking Champion of Capua.
00:13:00.697,00:13:03.742,Your myth to echo for a thousand years.
00:13:03.742,00:13:06.035,And I...
00:13:06.035,00:13:07.786,Varro.
00:13:07.786,00:13:09.456,The die call your name!
00:13:12.292,00:13:14.835,And Varro answers.
00:13:16.170,00:13:17.589,You continue to gamble.
00:13:17.589,00:13:20.383,A few coins to pass the time.
00:13:24.803,00:13:28.891,You fucking wait until gladiators have filled their bellies.
00:13:31.185,00:13:33.229,Let them eat.
00:13:33.229,00:13:37.900,They must embrace pain and suffering to become gladiators.
00:13:37.900,00:13:39.110,This is how it is done.
00:13:41.237,00:13:42.947,Not by you.
00:13:56.670,00:14:00.965,"Spartacus, the Kind and Gentle one."
00:14:06.887,00:14:10.433,"Do not mistake me, Crixus."
00:14:10.433,00:14:12.893,I give no shit about these men.
00:14:15.438,00:14:19.108,But you are no longer the Champion of Capua.
00:14:20.735,00:14:24.781,You do not take lead here.
00:14:24.781,00:14:26.240,You follow.
00:14:43.383,00:14:47.887,The man who follows is forever at your back.
00:14:47.887,00:14:50.557,Something to consider champion.
00:14:57.731,00:14:59.774,Fucking Gauls.
00:15:01.442,00:15:03.737,Much gratitude.
00:15:03.737,00:15:05.864,Men should not die with empty stomachs.
00:15:18.292,00:15:20.044,Rhaskos.
00:15:20.044,00:15:22.255,"Um, End of the month already, is it?"
00:15:22.255,00:15:25.383,According to the calendar you cannot read.
00:15:25.383,00:15:27.218,Your winnings amount to three and a half denarii.
00:15:27.218,00:15:28.678,"Preserve coin, or indulge yourself?"
00:15:28.678,00:15:31.765,When do I ever take coin over gash?
00:15:31.765,00:15:34.058,I expect her ass to be returned free of blood.
00:15:43.443,00:15:47.113,"Ashur, You pass my cell by mistake."
00:15:47.113,00:15:48.823,Where is my coin?
00:15:54.871,00:15:56.581,The mistake is yours.
00:15:56.581,00:16:01.461,"You do not fight, you are entitled to neither coin nor cunt."
00:16:02.754,00:16:05.047,The Dominus shall hear about this.
00:16:05.047,00:16:09.594,set the names.
00:16:09.594,00:16:14.933,"Perhaps next month you should find yourself again among them, should your wounds ever heal."
00:16:18.102,00:16:20.730,"Varro, a moment."
00:16:20.730,00:16:24.108,amass much coin.
00:16:24.108,00:16:26.861,Shall I see it transferred to your wife as usual?
00:16:26.861,00:16:36.036,Or-- would you prefer a small portion applied towards more pressing concerns?
00:16:58.184,00:17:01.228,That tiny man is the fucking Champion of Capua?
00:17:01.228,00:17:03.773,Fucking Romans swell his legend to their advantage.
00:17:03.773,00:17:05.107,"We could easily best the man, Agron."
00:17:05.107,00:17:07.276,Spartacus defeated Theokoles.
00:17:07.276,00:17:10.905,And the skies wept to honor of his victory.
00:17:10.905,00:17:14.200,The two of you would present challenge equal to piss and shit.
00:17:19.831,00:17:21.248,You find my words amusing?
00:17:21.248,00:17:23.042,"Your words, no."
00:17:23.042,00:17:27.046,"The stupid fuck that speaks them, very fucking amusing."
00:17:27.046,00:17:30.049,Spartacus is a man to be held as an example.
00:17:30.049,00:17:32.051,The slave ignites the arena.
00:17:32.051,00:17:34.387,One day the flames shall set him free.
00:17:35.680,00:17:37.974,I've witnessed such a thing.
00:17:37.974,00:17:43.229,"The roar of the crowd, demanding a gladiator be granted freedom for his showing in the arena."
00:17:43.229,00:17:46.941,You haven't even earned the mark of the fucking brotherhood and you cluck about freedom.
00:17:46.941,00:17:48.735,Segovax is right.
00:17:48.735,00:17:51.571,Spartacus shows us the way.
00:17:51.571,00:17:56.075,"I will train as he trains, every thrust and counter committed to memory."
00:17:57.159,00:17:59.453,And one day...
00:17:59.453,00:18:02.999,I too will become legend in the arena.
00:18:04.959,00:18:06.544,Raaa!
00:18:38.993,00:18:42.038,His wounds need yet more time.
00:18:42.038,00:18:43.289,How much longer?
00:18:43.289,00:18:44.832,A fortnight or two.
00:18:44.832,00:18:46.500,Perhaps three.
00:18:46.500,00:18:48.210,Uhh...Jupiter's cock!
00:18:48.210,00:18:53.257,His recovery may be aided by certain herbs absent the apothecary.
00:18:56.385,00:19:01.015,"Dominus, I've been without sword for too long."
00:19:01.015,00:19:02.642,Let me resume training.
00:19:05.352,00:19:07.271,I will see all on the list procured.
00:19:12.192,00:19:13.736,Mandragora... henbane..
00:19:13.736,00:19:15.279,lye... thorn apple...
00:19:15.279,00:19:18.407,hemlock... belladonna...
00:19:18.407,00:19:20.952,"Substantial lists, requiring substantial coin."
00:19:20.952,00:19:22.453,Procure the highest quality.
00:19:22.453,00:19:24.538,"A justified expense, should remedy result."
00:19:24.538,00:19:26.124,May the gods see it fucking so.
00:19:26.124,00:19:28.208,Too many days pass without progress.
00:19:28.208,00:19:31.378,When Doctore suffered wounds from Theokoles...
00:19:31.378,00:19:33.589,did they require equal time in the healing?
00:19:33.589,00:19:36.134,Considerably less.
00:19:36.134,00:19:39.846,There might be a blessing hidden among such a curse.
00:19:39.846,00:19:44.725,Talk of Crixus' true condition surely has not escaped beyond these walls. Yet.
00:19:45.685,00:19:46.936,Your meaning?
00:19:46.936,00:19:49.730,Inquiries for his purchase could be made in a delicate fashion.
00:19:49.730,00:19:51.774,My visit to the market could serve dual purposes.
00:19:53.567,00:19:55.194,Remove the thought.
00:19:55.194,00:19:56.445,There'll be no talk of selling Crixus.
00:19:58.072,00:19:59.490,"I only fear for the future, Dominus."
00:19:59.490,00:20:02.869,One that does not see Spartacus erased from it.
00:20:02.869,00:20:05.371,Straighten your fucking tongue and speak plainly.
00:20:05.371,00:20:10.250,"Yesterday I witnessed the hatred cultivates towards Spartacus, grow beyond measure."
00:20:10.250,00:20:14.254,"If in his mad passion Crixus, were to make attempt on his life..."
00:20:14.254,00:20:16.298,"Solicit numbers from Sextus, alone."
00:20:19.301,00:20:22.429,I wish only to discover his current value.
00:20:22.429,00:20:24.057,You would sell Crixus?
00:20:28.102,00:20:30.270,I would explore all avenues of reason.
00:20:30.270,00:20:33.357,Which has flown if you consider such a thing.
00:20:33.357,00:20:35.234,Crixus will fight again.
00:20:35.234,00:20:37.820,But will he ever be the man he was?
00:20:37.820,00:20:39.989,"Give him time to heal, Quintus."
00:20:39.989,00:20:41.866,"He bleeds when pierced, as does any man."
00:20:43.242,00:20:45.870,"They see him a god, and we present him as such."
00:20:45.870,00:20:48.998,"Should that myth evaporate, so goes his worth."
00:20:48.998,00:20:52.043,Then we'll find worth in another role.
00:20:52.043,00:20:54.378,Well surely his knowledge would aid instruction to the lower men?
00:20:54.378,00:20:55.629,We already have a Doctore.
00:20:55.629,00:20:57.090,The finest in any ludus.
00:20:58.174,00:21:00.051,"He could work beside you, then."
00:21:00.051,00:21:01.177,Crixus has no head for numbers.
00:21:01.177,00:21:02.929,The sword is his only purpose.
00:21:02.929,00:21:05.431,"He's part of the family, Quintus!"
00:21:05.431,00:21:08.308,He is a fucking slave!
00:21:08.308,00:21:11.353,"This house, this family, is a business, Lucretia."
00:21:11.353,00:21:19.403,"As much regret results from selling a gladiator like Crixus, when the time arrives, and it fucking will for them all, it's a necessity that must be swallowed."
00:21:21.822,00:21:23.323,No decision has yet to be made.
00:21:23.323,00:21:26.035,He may still prove himself fit.
00:21:26.035,00:21:28.621,Turn your mind towards and her friends.
00:21:54.313,00:21:56.274,Good.
00:21:56.274,00:21:58.609,But you lower your shield when you thrust.
00:21:58.609,00:22:00.694,It leaves you open from shoulder to neck.
00:22:00.694,00:22:02.113,Again.
00:22:03.572,00:22:04.949,Crixus.
00:22:06.909,00:22:08.286,What are you doing?
00:22:08.286,00:22:10.913,Doctore's gaze misses nothing.
00:22:10.913,00:22:13.582,A risk made necessary by unfortunate events.
00:22:17.044,00:22:18.171,Has something happened to you?
00:22:18.171,00:22:19.797,I am ever safe.
00:22:19.797,00:22:21.507,But Dominus...
00:22:21.507,00:22:23.509,he considers selling you to another master.
00:22:25.427,00:22:26.679,You're mistaken.
00:22:26.679,00:22:28.931,Ashur has been sent to market for herb...
00:22:33.311,00:22:35.729,and to question Vibius on his interest towards you.
00:22:37.898,00:22:43.070,Vibius? Lanista of shits and mongrels!
00:22:47.283,00:22:51.204,"Crixus, you must prove to Dominus that your time has not passed."
00:23:03.216,00:23:10.639,To step onto the sand as a gladiator is the highest position a slave can pray for.
00:23:10.639,00:23:12.141,Prove yourselves.
00:23:13.351,00:23:15.769,Earn the mark of the brotherhood.
00:23:19.565,00:23:21.734,You strike a solid blow.
00:23:27.114,00:23:29.783,He may be a fool.
00:23:29.783,00:23:31.827,But he is one who is fit to train.
00:23:32.953,00:23:34.496,Again.
00:23:34.496,00:23:36.207,You doubt that I am fully healed?
00:23:37.208,00:23:40.294,Coz I will show you otherwise.
00:23:47.176,00:23:48.468,Shall I indulge?
00:23:50.304,00:23:52.598,He believes himself ready.
00:23:52.598,00:23:53.974,As do I.
00:23:56.352,00:23:59.730,"Segovax, your sword and shield."
00:24:06.820,00:24:08.406,Attend!
00:24:17.331,00:24:18.832,"Show then whose champion, Crixus!"
00:24:40.562,00:24:44.984,He attacks boldly to hasten victory.
00:24:49.487,00:24:51.115,Counter to proper training.
00:25:05.587,00:25:11.844,"Defeat is delivered not only by the sword, but also the crowd."
00:25:14.138,00:25:19.685,"Fall from their grace, and you may never rise to former glories."
00:25:33.573,00:25:38.620,A true gladiator is taught to embrace pain and suffering.
00:25:41.623,00:25:44.502,To fight until life flees from his worthless body.
00:26:14.156,00:26:15.573,Learn from this man.
00:26:18.118,00:26:19.828,Or share his fate.
00:26:21.038,00:26:22.248,Spartacus!
00:26:23.707,00:26:26.043,Return to training.
00:26:26.043,00:26:27.461,Dominus.
00:26:34.260,00:26:38.138,"Rhaskos, Hamilcar."
00:26:38.138,00:26:39.597,See him to the Medicus.
00:26:51.485,00:26:52.945,"A fine offer, good Vibius."
00:26:52.945,00:26:54.863,I shall hasten to present it to my master.
00:26:56.407,00:26:59.285,"A moment, slave."
00:26:59.285,00:27:03.497,You frequent the market absent Batiatus?
00:27:03.497,00:27:06.166,I conduct important business on his behalf.
00:27:07.293,00:27:09.211,Regarding the former Champion of Capua?
00:27:10.546,00:27:13.257,I discuss no business of the like.
00:27:13.257,00:27:15.633,"I would, if found in your position."
00:27:17.677,00:27:20.638,Crixus is champion in name only.
00:27:20.638,00:27:23.058,"He is but limbs, dangling from a skewered trunk."
00:27:24.017,00:27:29.231,Your master would be well served pawning him off on a toad like Vibius.
00:27:29.231,00:27:33.068,Your concern for my master is well received.
00:27:33.068,00:27:37.030,"My concern is not for him, but about him."
00:27:38.656,00:27:40.409,Are your ears receptive?
00:27:46.248,00:27:48.750,I cannot stop a free man from speech.
00:27:48.750,00:27:55.633,"Were Batiatus,were to seek reprisal for offenses he believes I have made, I would wish warning in advance."
00:28:00.846,00:28:02.680,I am a villain.
00:28:05.518,00:28:07.394,But I'm not your villain.
00:28:07.394,00:28:08.937,Seek another slave.
00:28:08.937,00:28:14.485,"Loyalty can become a crushing weight, if not braced by proper support."
00:28:15.819,00:28:24.578,"When your back begins to break, you'll find my shoulders broad and welcoming."
00:28:30.167,00:28:32.710,You overreach.
00:28:32.710,00:28:34.796,And here is the result.
00:28:34.796,00:28:38.342,Do not address me as you would a recruit.
00:28:38.342,00:28:40.010,Then do not act like one.
00:28:40.010,00:28:46.225,"Words of import from the mighty Spartacus, Bringer of Rain!"
00:28:46.225,00:28:49.019,Slayer of Theokoles!
00:28:49.019,00:28:52.356,As if you stood against him on your own.
00:28:52.356,00:28:57.194,"Without my aid, you would have nothing."
00:28:57.194,00:29:00.406,Not even your miserable life.
00:29:02.491,00:29:04.326,But here I stand.
00:29:04.326,00:29:06.412,And there you sit.
00:29:06.412,00:29:13.835,"You know shit about being champion, of being a true brother."
00:29:13.835,00:29:15.588,You are only playing at your own part.
00:29:17.548,00:29:18.882,And one day the game will end.
00:29:30.852,00:29:35.608,"Press me again, and you shall find yours."
00:29:41.280,00:29:45.784,"Gratitude for joining us this evening, at the House of Batiatus."
00:29:45.784,00:29:51.915,"Indeed has spoken so very highly of you that, I feel as if I'm with old friends."
00:29:51.915,00:29:53.875,"Oh, that's a disadvantage."
00:29:53.875,00:29:57.671,Ilithyia neglected to mention she was acquainted with the wife of good Batiatus.
00:29:57.671,00:29:59.339,I am sure I must have.
00:29:59.339,00:30:01.841,"She is quite the bitch, if you have not noticed."
00:30:01.841,00:30:03.885,Which is why we love her so.
00:30:03.885,00:30:05.804,I grow rather fond of her myself.
00:30:05.804,00:30:07.931,"Mmm, I could use a cup of wine to wet the tongue."
00:30:07.931,00:30:10.058,"You could be drowning, and gurgle the same."
00:30:10.058,00:30:11.435,Oh!
00:30:11.435,00:30:13.145,Mmm. Is this Sestian?
00:30:17.023,00:30:19.693,Only because I have told her how important you are to me.
00:30:19.693,00:30:22.655,"Yes, we all love each other and have orgies under the new moon."
00:30:22.655,00:30:24.531,Now tell us stories!
00:30:24.531,00:30:27.867,"Yes, tell us everything about this horrid place!"
00:30:27.867,00:30:30.036,She means the ludus below.
00:30:30.036,00:30:31.538,Do I need an interpreter?
00:30:31.538,00:30:32.456,Apparently.
00:30:32.456,00:30:34.583,"Do be quiet, let her speak!"
00:30:34.583,00:30:36.918,How do you live among such beasts?
00:30:36.918,00:30:39.254,My husband sees them well tamed.
00:30:39.254,00:30:40.798,I pray not fully.
00:30:42.341,00:30:44.259,Some instinct remains.
00:30:44.259,00:30:47.887,So that they may yet unleash their savagery in the arena.
00:30:47.887,00:30:50.349,I would go insane here!
00:30:50.349,00:30:52.892,"Surrounded by all these animals, high atop this mountain."
00:30:52.892,00:30:56.271,"Would you not prefer to live in the city, surrounded by real people?"
00:30:59.650,00:31:02.695,I find that we are perfectly located.
00:31:02.695,00:31:07.073,I need only step out onto my balcony and all of Capua kneels at my feet.
00:31:07.073,00:31:09.493,Well stated.
00:31:09.493,00:31:10.994,But are you not bored?
00:31:10.994,00:31:12.454,"Up here, all alone?"
00:31:12.454,00:31:16.709,"Nothing but slaves and beasts, not even children to occupy.."
00:31:19.002,00:31:20.796,Boredom?
00:31:20.796,00:31:23.716,Impossible with so many distractions!
00:31:24.842,00:31:26.968,I stay quite occupied.
00:31:30.055,00:31:33.851,"Yesterday, in fact, six new recruits began their training."
00:31:33.851,00:31:36.562,One of whom fights under Ilithyia's patronage.
00:31:38.397,00:31:40.065,Ilithyia?
00:31:40.065,00:31:41.650,Claudius gave you approval?
00:31:41.650,00:31:42.860,He does not know.
00:31:46.697,00:31:49.199,"A few coins, parceled from my allowance."
00:31:49.199,00:31:51.201,He will kill you when he finds out!
00:31:54.162,00:31:56.874,"Mmm, a gladiator of your own!"
00:31:56.874,00:31:58.751,May we see him?
00:31:58.751,00:32:01.378,"Course, he's not yet a gladiator."
00:32:01.378,00:32:05.006,He must pass the final test before he earns the mark of Batiatus.
00:32:05.006,00:32:07.926,"Oh. So he is only a slave, then?"
00:32:09.969,00:32:11.680,"Oh, for the time being but.."
00:32:11.680,00:32:14.099,I would lay eyes upon a real gladiator.
00:32:17.227,00:32:18.228,A champion!
00:32:18.228,00:32:20.146,Bring Spartacus up!
00:32:20.146,00:32:23.650,"Spartacus, Oh yes!"
00:32:23.650,00:32:24.818,You must!
00:32:26.945,00:32:29.948,Bring the Champion.
00:32:29.948,00:32:33.159,Let us all revel in his presence.
00:32:42.377,00:32:45.088,Gratitude.
00:32:45.088,00:32:46.256,For your aid in my training today.
00:32:50.719,00:32:56.516,"I would be eager to hear any advice, to further my cause."
00:32:56.516,00:32:59.436,Your cause?
00:32:59.436,00:33:03.315,"Victories in the arena, and freedom."
00:33:14.493,00:33:17.621,Accept your fate...
00:33:17.621,00:33:21.249,or be destroyed by specters of a past never to return.
00:33:21.249,00:33:24.169,"Spartacus, You are summoned."
00:33:28.882,00:33:32.594,"Mmm, he stands as Mars, ready for war."
00:33:40.143,00:33:42.980,Gladiators share the blood of the gods?
00:33:42.980,00:33:45.357,"The mighty Crixus, most certainly."
00:33:45.357,00:33:46.859,Now there was a man!
00:33:46.859,00:33:48.861,Truly blessed by the gods!
00:33:48.861,00:33:51.196,When will we see him in the arena again?
00:33:52.364,00:33:54.700,"What of you, Spartacus ?"
00:33:54.700,00:33:56.952,Are you a blessing to us?
00:33:56.952,00:33:59.746,To some.
00:33:59.746,00:34:02.582,"To others, a curse."
00:34:02.582,00:34:04.960,A duality of his kind.
00:34:04.960,00:34:07.379,Admired as a gladiator.
00:34:07.379,00:34:09.882,Yet despised as a slave.
00:34:09.882,00:34:11.967,He is much more than a common slave.
00:34:11.967,00:34:14.469,You can feel it radiating from his flesh...
00:34:15.595,00:34:19.349,I have heard tale of a champion's blood possessing many restorative powers.
00:34:19.349,00:34:24.604,A few drops in a glass of wine is said to make a man hard for days!
00:34:24.604,00:34:26.857,Such are the legends.
00:34:26.857,00:34:29.860,"Well I would test them for myself, if I could?"
00:34:30.986,00:34:32.195,I'll send a messenger with a vial..
00:34:41.371,00:34:42.664,May I have the honor?
00:34:48.962,00:34:52.507,Take care not to cut too deeply.
00:34:52.507,00:34:57.637,"The legend does call for the blood of a dead gladiator, does it not?"
00:34:57.637,00:35:00.974,But such details should not concern us.
00:35:00.974,00:35:03.101,Spartacus will die soon enough...
00:35:06.187,00:35:08.690,To the roar of the crowd.
00:35:16.698,00:35:19.158,I do not believe he will ever fall in the arena.
00:35:19.158,00:35:20.953,He is a god among men.
00:35:20.953,00:35:23.204,He's nothing but a Thracian dog.
00:35:23.204,00:35:25.082,His treachery dishonored Rome.
00:35:26.750,00:35:28.710,Guards!
00:35:28.710,00:35:30.837,He abandoned defenseless women and children.
00:35:30.837,00:35:32.297,Left to be raped and murdered.
00:35:32.297,00:35:33.632,Get him out of here!
00:35:34.967,00:35:36.175,What a bold tongue!
00:35:36.175,00:35:38.386,Apologies.
00:35:38.386,00:35:39.638,"Were he my slave, I would have him crucified!"
00:35:42.057,00:35:43.433,For what?
00:35:43.433,00:35:45.102,Speaking the truth?
00:35:52.150,00:35:54.152,"The hour grows late, and I'm expected."
00:35:56.071,00:36:00.241,Gratitude for a most interesting evening.
00:36:00.241,00:36:02.285,One that begs a repeat soon.
00:36:11.336,00:36:13.088,Apologies.
00:36:13.088,00:36:15.590,None required.
00:36:15.590,00:36:21.262,You will soon learn that women of note have a rabid taste for the embarrassment of their friends.
00:36:21.262,00:36:23.431,Well I would not see mine treated so.
00:36:26.434,00:36:30.605,"May I have words with Segovax, before I take my leave?"
00:36:30.605,00:36:33.942,I wish to bid my man good fortune in the days to follow.
00:36:35.401,00:36:37.654,Ahh!
00:36:40.073,00:36:42.075,"Ah, my fortune returns!"
00:36:45.996,00:36:48.289,Varro.
00:36:48.289,00:36:49.207,I'm of a winning mind.
00:36:49.207,00:36:51.543,Save your words of caution.
00:36:51.543,00:36:53.336,I'm not here for words.
00:36:53.336,00:36:55.338,I'm here for dice.
00:36:55.338,00:36:56.798,You and dice?
00:36:56.798,00:36:58.175,I am of a mood tonight.
00:36:58.175,00:37:00.385,I would have distraction.
00:37:00.385,00:37:01.511,And coin.
00:37:04.973,00:37:06.265,"The rules, then."
00:37:06.265,00:37:09.394,"Should I need instruction, I shall ask."
00:37:28.038,00:37:29.414,Leave us.
00:37:32.084,00:37:35.712,"Do you know who I am, slave?"
00:37:35.712,00:37:38.590,Apologies.
00:37:38.590,00:37:40.008,I do not.
00:37:41.218,00:37:44.387,I am your Domina.
00:37:44.387,00:37:46.305,My coin pays for your training.
00:37:47.807,00:37:49.101,Water.
00:37:49.101,00:37:50.476,Food.
00:37:50.476,00:37:52.604,The very air you breathe.
00:37:54.606,00:38:00.319,"Survive to receive the mark, and you will become my gladiator."
00:38:01.404,00:38:03.031,My champion.
00:38:06.367,00:38:07.493,Domina.
00:38:11.330,00:38:16.878,"Please me, and the rewards will be substantial."
00:38:18.379,00:38:19.672,Wine...
00:38:19.672,00:38:21.800,women...
00:38:21.800,00:38:23.426,"even freedom, perhaps."
00:38:26.012,00:38:28.723,You desire such a thing?
00:38:28.723,00:38:30.683,Freedom?
00:38:30.683,00:38:32.060,"Yes, Domina."
00:38:36.106,00:38:39.234,There is something I desire.
00:38:39.234,00:38:44.197,"See it attended to, and your freedom will be secured..."
00:38:47.200,00:38:49.661,should never have been summoned!
00:38:49.661,00:38:51.329,I had little choice.
00:38:51.329,00:38:53.248,"Ilithyia, and the man should be kept separate."
00:38:53.248,00:38:56.459,Throwing them together invites calamity.
00:38:59.879,00:39:02.257,"Lincinia, intimates another visit."
00:39:03.133,00:39:04.425,Spartacus her purpose?
00:39:04.425,00:39:05.593,Undoubtedly.
00:39:06.719,00:39:10.556,Then we shall accommodate.
00:39:10.556,00:39:18.273,"Her cousin good Crassus owns the fucking heavens, even if he is not currently favored by his fellows in the senate."
00:39:20.108,00:39:21.693,Your efforts raise us ever higher.
00:39:23.528,00:39:26.447,And how do yours fare?
00:39:26.447,00:39:28.491,Have you received offers for Crixus?
00:39:28.491,00:39:30.618,I meet Vibius tomorrow.
00:39:30.618,00:39:32.453,Vibius?
00:39:32.453,00:39:33.872,His ludus is in Damascus!
00:39:33.872,00:39:37.167,"Crixus will fare better in the smaller venues, until he is healed."
00:39:40.795,00:39:42.005,"Well, tomorrow, then?"
00:39:43.589,00:39:45.675,His glory fades.
00:39:45.675,00:39:48.220,I would not have it extinguish beneath our roof.
00:39:51.181,00:39:54.059,Damascus?
00:39:54.059,00:39:57.436,Dominus meets with tomorrow.
00:39:57.436,00:40:00.398,I've never seen Damascus.
00:40:00.398,00:40:02.359,Do you think I'll like it?
00:40:05.653,00:40:08.907,You cannot go.
00:40:08.907,00:40:12.327,The decision is made.
00:40:12.327,00:40:14.704,Even Domina doubts me.
00:40:14.704,00:40:16.164,I see it in her eyes.
00:40:20.752,00:40:26.299,Then convince her otherwise.
00:40:26.299,00:40:28.467,My words carry no weight.
00:40:31.846,00:40:33.598,I do not speak of words.
00:40:41.147,00:40:42.523,You would have me do this?
00:40:45.360,00:40:47.112,I would have you stay.
00:41:05.838,00:41:06.881,The coin you lost to me.
00:41:06.881,00:41:10.343,Which makes it yours.
00:41:10.343,00:41:11.261,You are a fool.
00:41:11.261,00:41:12.971,You have thrown dice before.
00:41:12.971,00:41:16.641,I turned from such things years ago.
00:41:16.641,00:41:19.394,For my wife.
00:41:19.394,00:41:21.313,You are a better man than I.
00:41:21.313,00:41:23.315,"Do not forget why you are here, Varro."
00:41:23.315,00:41:25.650,Remove your hand.
00:41:25.650,00:41:26.818,You dishonor your own wife.
00:41:26.818,00:41:28.445,My wife is a whore!
00:41:35.452,00:41:37.578,She carries another man's child.
00:41:51.592,00:41:52.969,How did this come to be?
00:41:52.969,00:41:55.638,"A friend, from the marketplace."
00:41:57.932,00:41:58.975,And you find fault with her?
00:41:58.975,00:42:00.143,She did not fight.
00:42:00.143,00:42:03.438,"Had you not left to pay your debts, she would not have had to."
00:42:07.650,00:42:10.736,"She lives, Varro."
00:42:10.736,00:42:13.198,She lives.
00:42:13.198,00:42:14.824,You may yet hold her in your arms.
00:42:18.577,00:42:21.831,A thought a decent man would cherish.
00:42:40.933,00:42:45.563,My husband is at market on business concerning you.
00:42:45.563,00:42:47.857,He believes your day may have passed.
00:42:50.568,00:42:53.405,And you?
00:42:53.405,00:42:54.531,I pray he is mistaken.
00:42:58.659,00:43:02.205,And your gods?
00:43:02.205,00:43:04.665,Do they answer your prayers?
00:43:04.665,00:43:07.168,They're silent.
00:43:17.011,00:43:21.599,Then let us crack open the heavens...
00:43:21.599,00:43:24.310,and gain their attention...
00:43:29.023,00:43:31.484,Remove any doubt...
00:43:31.484,00:43:33.819,that my day has passed...
00:43:35.447,00:43:37.073,Ah!
00:43:37.073,00:43:39.075,Ah!
00:43:39.075,00:43:40.952,Oh!
00:43:54.507,00:43:55.841,She seemed... pleased.
00:43:55.841,00:43:57.093,Naevia.
00:43:57.093,00:43:59.762,You did what you had to.
00:43:59.762,00:44:01.764,What I asked of you.
00:44:06.352,00:44:09.397,Dominus is already at market.
00:44:09.397,00:44:12.191,Speaking with Vibius.
00:44:12.191,00:44:14.902,There is nothing that cannot be undone.
00:44:14.902,00:44:17.655,"You are a good man, Crixus."
00:44:17.655,00:44:19.031,The gods will not see you treated so.
00:44:19.907,00:44:22.201,They now favor Spartacus.
00:44:24.454,00:44:25.704,They give no shit for me.
00:45:31.854,00:45:34.023,"Forgive me, champion..."
00:46:12.769,00:46:18.025,You'd kill a fellow Gaul...
00:46:18.025,00:46:21.320,to save a man you hate?
00:46:21.320,00:46:22.614,I do not save Spartacus.
00:46:24.865,00:46:27.910,I saved a Brother who shares the mark.
00:46:37.962,00:46:41.215,You have earned a glorious death...
00:46:41.215,00:46:44.427,And will die at the hands of a gladiator.
00:46:48.681,00:46:55.688,"I leave these walls for a fucking moment and a recruit tries to kill Spartacus, Ilithyia's own fucking man?!"
00:46:55.688,00:46:58.316,"And he would have succeeded, if it weren't for Crixus."
00:46:59.858,00:47:01.986,His days not passed.
00:47:01.986,00:47:03.820,Oh fuck!
00:47:03.820,00:47:04.821,Send note to Vibius.
00:47:07.283,00:47:09.494,"Oh, I feared terms were already agreed upon."
00:47:09.494,00:47:11.162,Well fuck the terms!
00:47:11.162,00:47:13.581,"Should he have issue, he can reason to my cock."
00:47:16.917,00:47:21.756,"Ahh, the snake arrives, walking as if human."
00:47:21.756,00:47:24.091,I pray I have not missed the test?
00:47:24.091,00:47:26.678,"Delayed, due to most unfortunate events."
00:47:26.678,00:47:32.099,"Spartacus, the Champion of Capua, was attacked unawares in the baths."
00:47:32.099,00:47:34.059,Attacked?
00:47:34.059,00:47:37.104,"By your recruit, Segovax."
00:47:37.104,00:47:40.316,How unfortunate.
00:47:40.316,00:47:43.319,"For your man, yes."
00:47:43.319,00:47:45.154,"He had to be punished, of course."
00:48:03.922,00:48:05.800,Spartacus yet lives.
00:48:05.800,00:48:07.009,Yet.
00:48:13.725,00:48:18.103,"Your man would not speak as to his reason, even when parted from his cock."
00:48:29.948,00:48:33.745,He gave you no sign of cause when you met with him last night did he?
00:48:33.745,00:48:36.288,No. It is a mystery.
00:48:48.217,00:48:50.969,"I will regain my position, champion."
00:48:52.179,00:48:55.516,I welcome the attempt.
00:00:27.444,00:00:29.822,"Ah, fuck."
00:00:29.947,00:00:32.073,Two weeks and the mark's still raw as a whore's cunt.
00:00:32.199,00:00:35.703,"Argh, I bear the same mark, brother."
00:00:35.828,00:00:36.912,Without pissing about it.
00:00:37.037,00:00:38.789,"Ha, ha, ha, ha."
00:00:57.057,00:00:59.059,You lower your guard after each assault.
00:00:59.184,00:01:00.686,I shall see it raised then.
00:01:15.492,00:01:16.911,Your head is mine.
00:01:17.036,00:01:18.871,How shall I mount it?
00:01:21.832,00:01:23.166,You move well today.
00:01:23.291,00:01:25.293,You do not.
00:01:25.419,00:01:26.336,What distracts you?
00:01:26.461,00:01:29.924,I had Ashur send a letter to Aurelia.
00:01:30.049,00:01:33.552,"A week past now, and no reply."
00:01:33.677,00:01:36.263,You expect different?
00:01:36.388,00:01:38.807,A woman seldom rushes back to the husband who calls her whore.
00:01:38.933,00:01:40.141,I said no such thing.
00:01:41.476,00:01:42.436,Not in words.
00:01:42.561,00:01:43.478,The letter was contrite.
00:01:43.604,00:01:45.856,I admitted I reacted poorly to the news of her being with child.
00:01:45.981,00:01:49.568,And now she makes you wait.
00:01:49.693,00:01:51.570,The way women punish us for being fools.
00:01:52.613,00:01:54.364,Strike it from your mind.
00:01:54.489,00:01:56.575,Or find your brains upon the sand.
00:02:01.455,00:02:02.748,These are exquisite.
00:02:02.873,00:02:05.793,"Yes, they've been in the family for generations."
00:02:05.918,00:02:09.671,So this sort of arrangement happens often?
00:02:09.797,00:02:11.256,No.
00:02:11.381,00:02:17.429,"But when such a request is made, one must be prepared to offer only the finest quality."
00:02:17.554,00:02:20.766,The House of Batiatus does not fall short in that regard.
00:02:25.938,00:02:27.564,"This one, I think."
00:02:31.443,00:02:32.653,A fine choice.
00:02:45.248,00:02:47.876,Do you think she would approve?
00:02:48.002,00:02:53.423,"When Actaeon saw her bathing, she turned the poor bastard into a stag and set his own dogs upon him."
00:02:53.548,00:02:57.136,"Oh, how fitting then, that you should have a stag of your own to play with."
00:02:57.260,00:02:58.804,Have you decided?
00:02:58.929,00:03:02.891,There is only one man I would invite such peril to know.
00:03:03.017,00:03:05.686,I will have Spartacus.
00:03:05.811,00:03:10.273,"The champion, of course."
00:03:11.358,00:03:12.985,Is that a problem?
00:03:13.110,00:03:14.028,If more coin is required.
00:03:14.153,00:03:16.237,"No, no, no, no, no."
00:03:16.363,00:03:22.452,"No the cousin to Marcus Crassus deserves the Slayer of Theokoles himself, at fair price."
00:03:22.577,00:03:25.998,"Oh, it is not the price that concerns."
00:03:26.123,00:03:28.500,Psssh.
00:03:28.625,00:03:30.460,If ever my husband were to hear of this.
00:03:30.585,00:03:34.173,The gods themselves would have to whisper it in his ear.
00:03:34.297,00:03:37.676,We take the utmost care with the delicate nature of these arrangements.
00:03:38.969,00:03:42.430,"The mask ensures anonymity, but you must also do your part."
00:03:42.556,00:03:45.100,Tell no one.
00:03:45.225,00:03:49.437,"Arrive exactly at the appointed time, unencumbered."
00:03:52.191,00:03:55.694,Who would hold your husband's loyalty truer to value.
00:03:55.819,00:04:00.532,"I would err, avoid complications, for you and this ludus."
00:04:00.657,00:04:02.993,Ilithyia.
00:04:03.118,00:04:04.452,Oh.
00:04:04.578,00:04:06.663,Apologies.
00:04:06.788,00:04:08.040,Am I early?
00:04:08.165,00:04:10.375,For what purpose?
00:04:10.500,00:04:12.544,You invited me to midday meal.
00:04:12.669,00:04:13.420,Did you?
00:04:13.545,00:04:15.463,Yes. For tomorrow.
00:04:15.589,00:04:17.007,"Oh, was it?"
00:04:19.009,00:04:22.054,I pray I have not interrupted important proceedings.
00:04:24.181,00:04:27.267,We were only just speaking about you and your gladiator.
00:04:27.392,00:04:28.936,What was his name?
00:04:29.061,00:04:30.104,The Celt...
00:04:30.229,00:04:31.063,Segovax.
00:04:31.188,00:04:32.981,"Yes, Segovax."
00:04:33.107,00:04:34.441,Pity.
00:04:34.566,00:04:38.070,Perhaps you should buy several next time. Until you get the hang of it.
00:04:38.195,00:04:40.948,It's a difficult process.
00:04:41.073,00:04:43.742,"Very few make it to the final test, still few the arena."
00:04:50.124,00:04:52.918,"Forgive my haste, but my own husband expects me."
00:04:55.837,00:04:58.339,I look forward to our next encounter.
00:05:07.348,00:05:09.517,And I her.
00:05:09.643,00:05:13.730,"It warms the heart, to know my hands are responsible."
00:05:13.855,00:05:16.775,Then let me take them in gratitude.
00:05:22.864,00:05:26.034,You should be more careful.
00:05:26.160,00:05:28.036,With Licinia.
00:05:28.162,00:05:34.668,"She's of a strata above your station, and will not hesitate to remind you of it the minute her mood shifts."
00:05:34.793,00:05:37.504,And it shifts frequently.
00:05:37.629,00:05:41.008,I am well versed in dealing with such people.
00:05:42.301,00:05:43.885,Of course you are.
00:05:46.638,00:05:49.432,"So, am I to be invited?"
00:05:51.476,00:05:53.270,Invited?
00:05:53.394,00:05:54.521,To what?
00:05:56.940,00:06:00.152,You think I did not notice the mask she was attempting to conceal?
00:06:00.277,00:06:02.196,You're mistaken.
00:06:02.321,00:06:03.989,There is no masquerade.
00:06:04.114,00:06:06.992,She merely wanted to borrow the visage of Diana.
00:06:07.117,00:06:10.453,To avoid complications?
00:06:10.578,00:06:13.832,A wealthy woman of status visiting a ludus.
00:06:13.957,00:06:18.503,Concealing masks and whispering of complications.
00:06:18.628,00:06:26.720,"If I did not know better, I would suspect intent to fuck one of your gladiators."
00:06:26.845,00:06:28.847,"She is, isn't she?"
00:06:28.972,00:06:30.224,"Oh, that little whore!"
00:06:30.349,00:06:32.517,How positively depraved!
00:06:41.651,00:06:45.404,You have been a most valued friend.
00:06:45.530,00:06:51.119,And this will be our little secret.
00:06:53.914,00:06:55.999,I can control her.
00:06:56.124,00:06:57.667,Ilithyia?
00:06:57.792,00:07:00.170,Like you did with her and Segovax?
00:07:00.295,00:07:02.881,"She had her own man make attempt on Spartacus, under our very roof."
00:07:03.006,00:07:04.383,And you yet speak of control.
00:07:04.507,00:07:06.843,Spartacus inflames her beyond reason.
00:07:06.968,00:07:10.264,Licinia is a different matter.
00:07:10.389,00:07:14.393,Even Ilithyia has sense enough to fear reprisal from the cousin of Marcus Crassus.
00:07:14.517,00:07:17.271,"Humph, as she should."
00:07:17.396,00:07:20.190,That man shits gold!
00:07:20.315,00:07:26.154,To have the favor of such an ally in Rome could pave my way to a seat in the curia...
00:07:26.280,00:07:28.615,There is one small obstacle.
00:07:30.367,00:07:33.494,Licinia favors the touch of our champion.
00:07:35.580,00:07:36.831,That will not be difficult.
00:07:36.957,00:07:38.292,"Oh, he's always difficult."
00:07:38.417,00:07:41.044,In a past that no longer exists.
00:07:41.169,00:07:42.379,I shall command...
00:07:47.550,00:07:49.177,Argh.
00:07:49.303,00:07:51.596,The Champion of Capua arrives!
00:07:58.812,00:08:02.357,My glory is but a reflection of my dominus.
00:08:02.482,00:08:03.400,You flatter!
00:08:03.524,00:08:05.568,I return in kind.
00:08:05.693,00:08:07.362,And the gods take notice.
00:08:07.487,00:08:12.326,"Just when I thought we'd accrued every accolade, yet another falls in our laps from the heavens."
00:08:12.451,00:08:17.497,"Fair Licinia, cousin to Marcus Crassus himself, has personally requested you."
00:08:17.622,00:08:18.623,Crassus?
00:08:18.748,00:08:20.667,Richest man in the Republic.
00:08:24.921,00:08:26.298,A great honor.
00:08:31.594,00:08:33.554,Opponent?!
00:08:33.680,00:08:36.516,Licinia has no interest in watching you fight.
00:08:36.641,00:08:38.268,Her desires are of a more...
00:08:38.393,00:08:39.644,intimate nature.
00:08:42.147,00:08:43.357,I am to lie with her?
00:08:43.482,00:08:45.650,And shame all men who follow.
00:08:48.028,00:08:50.364,Such things are asked of a champion?
00:08:50.489,00:08:52.573,They are.
00:08:52.699,00:08:54.326,You have concern?
00:08:57.037,00:08:58.705,No.
00:09:00.707,00:09:04.252,I am the champion of Capua.
00:09:04.378,00:09:06.587,I shall perform all duties required of me.
00:09:09.007,00:09:10.967,Bring her to satisfaction.
00:09:11.092,00:09:14.262,And see our fortunes rise along with your cock.
00:09:15.389,00:09:18.433,Is there discomfort?
00:09:18.558,00:09:20.185,None.
00:09:20.310,00:09:23.021,When can I return to training?
00:09:23.146,00:09:26.233,The fact that you yet walk among the living is a marvel in itself.
00:09:26.358,00:09:28.735,How long?
00:09:28.860,00:09:30.278,A week.
00:09:30.404,00:09:31.863,Maybe two..
00:09:32.864,00:09:34.032,Tomorrow.
00:09:34.157,00:09:36.659,No. It is much too soon.
00:09:38.537,00:09:41.748,Tomorrow.
00:09:41.873,00:09:43.291,"Tomorrow, then."
00:09:43.417,00:09:46.753,"A glorious day, long in coming!"
00:09:46.878,00:09:48.004,Crixus!
00:09:48.129,00:09:49.423,Risen from the dead!
00:09:49.548,00:09:54.428,"And Ashur, finally freed of his shackles, to take up sword again!"
00:09:54.553,00:09:56.971,You would resume training?
00:09:57.097,00:09:59.015,As a gladiator?
00:09:59.140,00:10:01.476,I yet bear the mark.
00:10:01.601,00:10:06.731,"And long to stand with my brothers, once more upon the sands of the arena."
00:10:17.242,00:10:20.912,Take this fucking thing off me.
00:10:21.037,00:10:22.747,Now.
00:10:31.047,00:10:32.382,He gave you no pause?
00:10:32.507,00:10:34.426,None.
00:10:34.551,00:10:35.885,Our dog...
00:10:36.010,00:10:38.972,is finally house broken...
00:10:40.765,00:10:42.476,You were wise...
00:10:42.601,00:10:44.519,to put down his bitch...
00:10:44.644,00:10:48.189,"Ohhh, oh, uh."
00:10:54.070,00:10:58.450,Leave...and send in some wine.
00:11:06.040,00:11:12.547,"We shall have Licinia's wet gratitude, and with it the ear of Marcus Crassus."
00:11:12.671,00:11:15.300,If Spartacus performs as promised.
00:11:18.637,00:11:20.679,I know he's willing.
00:11:20.805,00:11:24.434,But its been many months since he last lay with a woman.
00:11:24.559,00:11:27.937,"After such a time, his passion might be..."
00:11:28.062,00:11:29.564,all too brief.
00:11:29.730,00:11:31.399,"Well, that would prove unfortunate."
00:11:31.525,00:11:36.737,"Yet easily avoidable, if Spartacus is presented opportunity to hone his skills beforehand..."
00:11:51.878,00:11:54.464,You have wandered to the wrong cell.
00:11:54.589,00:11:56.883,Are you not Spartacus?
00:11:57.008,00:11:58.426,Bringer of Rain?
00:12:02.430,00:12:04.849,I am Mira.
00:12:04.974,00:12:06.809,I have been sent to please you.
00:12:06.934,00:12:08.520,To what end?
00:12:10.021,00:12:13.525,Is your pleasure not an end to itself?
00:12:13.650,00:12:16.236,I do not care for games.
00:12:16.361,00:12:19.280,Give your true purpose.
00:12:22.200,00:12:23.535,Find your tongue!
00:12:26.454,00:12:32.210,Domina fears that you've been too long without a women.
00:12:32.335,00:12:36.256,That you will be unable to withhold your seed long enough to please the Roman woman.
00:12:36.381,00:12:39.718,The notion offends me.
00:12:39.842,00:12:41.386,As does your presence.
00:12:49.185,00:12:50.978,You do not desire me?
00:12:51.104,00:12:54.773,I desire only sleep.
00:12:54.899,00:12:57.360,And the absence of dreams.
00:13:29.850,00:13:33.896,The gods grant me strength to rip these fucking bars from their moorings.
00:13:35.940,00:13:37.692,We yet share a roof.
00:13:37.816,00:13:40.612,It would not have happened if Dominus had sold me.
00:13:43.740,00:13:47.661,"To have you, but not have you."
00:13:47.786,00:13:49.996,It is a wound beyond healing.
00:13:52.206,00:13:54.584,All wounds heal.
00:13:54.709,00:13:56.169,Even the deepest.
00:13:56.294,00:13:59.547,Would that they had never been inflicted.
00:13:59.673,00:14:01.966,You would wish never to have known my heart?
00:14:25.031,00:14:28.576,The Undefeated Gaul returns.
00:14:28.702,00:14:31.287,Perhaps it is time he chose a new name.
00:14:33.540,00:14:35.625,Crixus.
00:14:35.750,00:14:38.252,My spirit soars to see you again upon the sands.
00:14:38.378,00:14:40.505,The underworld would not have me.
00:14:42.173,00:14:43.341,Take note!
00:14:43.466,00:14:46.969,A true champion rejoins the Brotherhood!
00:14:47.094,00:14:51.182,Champion of ass and balls.
00:15:02.151,00:15:05.029,Has there ever been such a man as Crixus?
00:15:05.864,00:15:07.615,"No, Domina."
00:15:07.741,00:15:09.325,There has not.
00:15:09.450,00:15:11.244,Praise the gods for his return.
00:15:11.369,00:15:14.372,May they guide him to many more victories.
00:15:14.497,00:15:17.625,And our purse filled by such.
00:15:17.751,00:15:19.210,Yes.
00:15:19.335,00:15:21.212,Filled to bursting.
00:15:22.380,00:15:23.715,You will spar with Duro.
00:15:24.841,00:15:26.008,The German?
00:15:26.133,00:15:27.802,He has yet to step in the arena.
00:15:27.927,00:15:30.597,And you have been long absent.
00:15:30.722,00:15:33.600,Prove yourself against the man and see advancement.
00:15:33.725,00:15:35.727,And who shall face Ashur?
00:15:43.443,00:15:48.322,"Choose carefully, for I long for blood."
00:15:48.448,00:15:50.909,You train?
00:15:51.033,00:15:52.786,By whose word?
00:15:52.911,00:15:59.041,The Dominus himself promised that I would rejoin the Brotherhood once I was freed from that fucking brace..
00:15:59.166,00:16:00.501,Ashur.
00:16:03.588,00:16:05.548,A word.
00:16:05.673,00:16:08.092,The master calls his dog.
00:16:09.844,00:16:11.596,What of my victory over Hasdrubal?
00:16:11.721,00:16:13.807,How the crowd roared when I cloved his head in two?
00:16:13.932,00:16:14.808,"A minor victory, long forgotten."
00:16:14.933,00:16:16.517,"Kleitos, then!"
00:16:16.643,00:16:18.352,Or..or Lysimachos..
00:16:18.478,00:16:19.395,Your days as a gladiator are past.
00:16:19.520,00:16:20.772,Dominus.
00:16:23.274,00:16:25.526,I beg of you.
00:16:25.652,00:16:27.987,Let me prove myself yet worthy.
00:16:28.112,00:16:29.864,You already have.
00:16:29.989,00:16:31.741,Outside of the arena.
00:16:31.866,00:16:33.868,Your cunning is sharper than any gladiator's sword.
00:16:33.993,00:16:37.831,I would not risk it on errands of foolish pride.
00:16:37.956,00:16:40.374,We in agreement?
00:16:40.500,00:16:42.752,"Your will, Dominus."
00:16:42.877,00:16:43.920,"To business, then."
00:16:44.044,00:16:45.713,I have had thoughts toward Solonius.
00:16:45.839,00:16:47.590,I would discuss on the way to market.
00:17:07.777,00:17:12.156,Did you note any signs of discomfort as Crixus took the sand?
00:17:12.281,00:17:14.826,"No, Domina."
00:17:14.951,00:17:17.745,He's anxious to regain his place.
00:17:17.871,00:17:22.166,"But I would not see him overreach, nor hide pain from his recovery."
00:17:22.291,00:17:26.880,"If you notice Crixus attempting to conceal anything from me, you tell me immediately."
00:17:27.005,00:17:28.673,"Yes, Domina."
00:17:28.798,00:17:32.552,The opposite sex has no sense whatever when it comes to their limits.
00:17:32.677,00:17:37.348,"They must be constantly watched, least they harm themselves in the simple act of being men."
00:17:39.225,00:17:40.727,Wait.
00:17:45.690,00:17:47.775,Domina.
00:17:47.901,00:17:49.986,How did you fare with Spartacus last night?
00:17:53.447,00:17:55.533,How many times did he have you?
00:17:57.827,00:18:00.413,Huh?
00:18:00.538,00:18:03.374,Speak.
00:18:03.499,00:18:05.793,He would not have me.
00:18:07.253,00:18:08.212,He would not?
00:18:08.337,00:18:09.756,"No, Domina."
00:18:09.881,00:18:12.341,And yet you wait until now to tell me?
00:18:12.466,00:18:14.635,I was afraid you would be displeased.
00:18:15.929,00:18:17.221,Take your dress off.
00:18:29.108,00:18:30.401,"Tits, ass and cunt."
00:18:30.526,00:18:32.946,All appear to be without disease or deformity.
00:18:33.071,00:18:38.451,"Which tells me the fault is not in the flesh, but in the bitch."
00:18:38.576,00:18:40.327,"Apologies, Domina."
00:18:40.453,00:18:45.750,Return to his cell tonight and I expect his cock in you.
00:18:45.875,00:18:48.377,Or you'll find a sword in its place.
00:18:51.714,00:18:53.215,Ahhh.
00:19:09.398,00:19:10.775,This isn't the arena.
00:19:10.900,00:19:13.653,"The world is my arena, pup."
00:19:26.082,00:19:27.959,Send me a man.
00:19:41.514,00:19:42.932,Stand down!
00:19:47.061,00:19:49.563,Duro!
00:19:49.689,00:19:51.024,Enough.
00:19:51.149,00:19:54.193,Half rations for the remainder of the week.
00:20:01.117,00:20:02.743,Crixus continues making friends.
00:20:08.041,00:20:09.542,Yet no word from your wife?
00:20:09.667,00:20:15.297,"None forthcoming, and no more coin to pay Ashur for the service of letters."
00:20:15.422,00:20:18.300,"You will dishonor us, if your mind is not on the games."
00:20:18.425,00:20:20.344,Tell the jackal I will cover the cost.
00:20:24.182,00:20:25.558,Quickly.
00:20:25.683,00:20:27.018,Before he departs.
00:20:28.728,00:20:31.105,Ashur.
00:20:31.230,00:20:34.274,Your man has run afoot.
00:20:34.400,00:20:36.610,Perhaps you'd care for a real opponent.
00:20:36.736,00:20:38.738,Are you so eager to return to the Medicus?
00:20:40.280,00:20:41.407,Crixus.
00:20:41.532,00:20:43.283,You are summoned.
00:20:44.326,00:20:45.578,Soon.
00:20:59.675,00:21:03.429,"Uhh, get off..."
00:21:03.554,00:21:06.724,"ahhh, tarry a while."
00:21:08.809,00:21:13.981,"Your masters yet at market, and Ilithyia's not expected for several hours."
00:21:20.571,00:21:23.908,"Uh, is my skin not soft?"
00:21:24.033,00:21:25.785,"Yes, Domina."
00:21:25.910,00:21:31.498,"I had the slaves draw a milk bath, recalling a time when it pleased you that we could afford such things..."
00:21:33.209,00:21:37.046,"Oh, does it yet cause you pain?"
00:21:37.171,00:21:39.339,"No, Domina."
00:21:39.465,00:21:42.093,I wish I could say the same.
00:21:42.218,00:21:45.596,It was torture to see such perfection marred by Theokoles.
00:21:46.889,00:21:49.433,When you fell to your knees..
00:21:52.311,00:21:59.568,"My heart seized in my chest, Then you looked up to the pulvinus."
00:21:59.693,00:22:01.070,To me.
00:22:01.195,00:22:05.074,"What was of your mind, in that frozen moment between life and death?"
00:22:09.162,00:22:14.792,"That I welcomed the afterlife, having know the love of a goddess."
00:22:22.258,00:22:25.594,"You will always be mine, Crixus."
00:22:25.719,00:22:28.388,Mine alone.
00:22:40.193,00:22:42.903,"Five sacks, for the price of ten."
00:22:43.029,00:22:45.239,"And see to it they are dryer this time, shit whore."
00:22:45.363,00:22:47.074,The last ones stank of mold.
00:22:47.200,00:22:49.160,"Do not churn, good Solonius."
00:22:50.577,00:22:54.498,The thief will suffer when prices plummet with the next harvest.
00:22:54.623,00:22:57.417,I pray his cock follows the decline.
00:22:59.003,00:23:01.339,You are left off leash?
00:23:01.463,00:23:02.923,My master is at his villa.
00:23:03.049,00:23:08.386,I yet have business to attend.
00:23:08.512,00:23:11.182,"And words, searching for receptive ears."
00:23:14.977,00:23:16.896,My situation has shifted.
00:23:17.021,00:23:18.522,"And with it, your loyalties?"
00:23:18.647,00:23:22.568,"Batiatus proves himself unworthy, as you had divined."
00:23:22.693,00:23:26.239,Such base character seldom weighs the true worth of a man.
00:23:26.364,00:23:29.700,I take it your scales are more in balance.
00:23:29.825,00:23:30.784,I hold valuable news.
00:23:30.910,00:23:34.247,Beyond the meager recompense you offered when last we spoke.
00:23:34.372,00:23:35.664,I am surrounded by jackals...
00:23:35.789,00:23:37.166,It concerns your life.
00:23:39.710,00:23:44.131,If that is no cause for you to loosen your purse..um.
00:23:45.341,00:23:46.550,Wait.
00:23:56.352,00:23:57.186,You have picked my bones clean.
00:23:57.311,00:23:59.230,"Speak, before I reclaim the meat."
00:23:59.355,00:24:03.234,"You fuck the whore Despoina on this night every week, do you not?"
00:24:03.359,00:24:05.236,You voice what is already well known to me.
00:24:05.945,00:24:06.987,Um.
00:24:12.410,00:24:15.246,Batiatus moves against me?
00:24:15.371,00:24:17.123,"I am to pay his agent, and see the order given."
00:24:20.209,00:24:21.585,You've been warned.
00:24:26.590,00:24:29.176,I really cannot believe the difference.
00:24:29.302,00:24:36.642,"When I first visited your home, I felt great sorrow for the woman forced to live in such conditions."
00:24:36.767,00:24:38.769,Now look at you.
00:24:38.894,00:24:44.024,Surrounded by opulence rivaling families of proper heritage.
00:24:44.150,00:24:50.156,"Trinkets merely, not nearly so valuable as your friendship."
00:24:51.865,00:24:54.868,You have many new friends of late.
00:24:54.994,00:24:58.956,You and Licinia seem quite at ease with one another.
00:25:01.667,00:25:03.461,Would you care for some wine or..
00:25:03.585,00:25:06.630,Wine will not still my thoughts.
00:25:09.507,00:25:19.935,"I prattle on with pleasantries, but I cannot pretend indifference to what you revealed about Licinia."
00:25:20.060,00:25:22.355,I revealed nothing.
00:25:22.480,00:25:24.315,You jumped to conclusions.
00:25:24.440,00:25:26.275,And landed on proper footing.
00:25:28.944,00:25:33.199,"Ever since, I can think of nothing else."
00:25:34.700,00:25:42.041,"With respect, Licinia's passions are her own concern."
00:25:46.879,00:25:50.007,It is filled with baser thoughts.
00:25:50.132,00:25:57.014,The vision of brutish hands being laid upon me.
00:25:57.139,00:26:02.019,in a manner quite lacking in my husband's touch.
00:26:03.687,00:26:06.273,I should not speak of such things.
00:26:06.399,00:26:07.358,I dishonor myself.
00:26:07.483,00:26:10.736,Your desires should not shame you.
00:26:12.821,00:26:15.366,You are a woman.
00:26:15.491,00:26:18.035,Our needs are vast.
00:26:20.578,00:26:21.955,I must put my mind from it.
00:26:22.081,00:26:23.665,To the purpose of distraction?
00:26:23.790,00:26:25.376,Preferred to discovery.
00:26:25.501,00:26:30.297,"Such a thing would ruin my husband, and taint my father's name."
00:26:30.423,00:26:34.176,Such concerns are voiced by all those who sample our wares.
00:26:35.844,00:26:39.639,"Can you name any, save Licinia?"
00:26:42.184,00:26:44.562,I have heard of none.
00:26:44.686,00:26:48.274,No. You have not.
00:26:50.692,00:26:52.903,Shall I make the arrangements?
00:27:02.704,00:27:04.373,Yes!
00:27:06.750,00:27:09.253,You will not be disappointed.
00:27:11.130,00:27:14.007,May I suggest Varro?
00:27:14.133,00:27:15.884,Varro?
00:27:16.009,00:27:17.803,"Uh, far too common."
00:27:17.928,00:27:20.680,The man must equal the risk.
00:27:20.806,00:27:24.351,A fact well known by your own desires.
00:27:24.477,00:27:28.939,Ones that I admittedly share...
00:27:31.984,00:27:32.901,Domina..
00:27:33.026,00:27:35.529,Get out you filthy slave!
00:27:35.653,00:27:36.489,Argh!
00:27:36.614,00:27:41.743,"My ears suggest a tempest, but eyes reveal a wife gone fucking mad!"
00:27:41.868,00:27:44.246,"Yes, well look to Ilithyia as the cause."
00:27:46.706,00:27:49.460,What new slights have prompted this costly eruption?
00:27:49.585,00:27:56.133,Her cunt overflows at the thought of Licinia bedding a gladiator.
00:27:56.258,00:28:02.431,"She demands equal treatment, so she set her lust on Crixus!"
00:28:02.556,00:28:05.309,And her choice droves you into rage?
00:28:09.104,00:28:14.193,"It's not her choice, it is her manner that offends."
00:28:14.318,00:28:20.491,"Honey drips from her tongue, to conceal the bite of piss that she showers upon us."
00:28:23.494,00:28:32.378,"The acrid taste is well familiar, but we must learn swallow it, along with our pride until we have secured her husband's patronage."
00:28:32.503,00:28:38.091,"What need have we of Glaber, Licinia delivers us Marcus Crassus?"
00:28:38.217,00:28:41.845,"Crassus' wealth is undeniable, yet he but holds the rank of senator."
00:28:41.970,00:28:44.181,Glaber outweighs with that of Legatus.
00:28:44.306,00:28:48.519,The favor of both coin and title would speed our ambitions.
00:28:55.067,00:28:59.530,One day soon we will give Ilithyia a lesson in manners.
00:28:59.655,00:29:03.116,"But for now, necessity dictates we give her Crixus."
00:29:03.992,00:29:05.911,Make the arrangements.
00:29:22.386,00:29:24.179,Fucking Gaul...
00:29:24.304,00:29:25.931,Turn your thoughts.
00:29:26.056,00:29:27.891,I'll have at him soon enough.
00:29:32.104,00:29:34.189,You wish your brother dead?
00:29:34.314,00:29:35.899,Who speaks such a thing?
00:29:37.276,00:29:38.277,Your actions.
00:29:40.862,00:29:46.744,"And who will do so in the arena, where every man must stand alone?"
00:29:46.868,00:29:48.537,You do him no favors.
00:29:48.662,00:29:50.205,You lie!
00:29:50.330,00:29:51.624,Varro.
00:29:51.749,00:29:52.750,Varro.
00:29:52.874,00:29:54.834,Hey. Tell him you lie!
00:29:54.960,00:29:57.463,I did what you paid me to do.
00:29:57.588,00:29:59.548,"I sought out his wife, but she was not there."
00:29:59.673,00:30:00.173,The boy?
00:30:00.299,00:30:04.553,I found no one.
00:30:06.597,00:30:08.307,Gain your senses!
00:30:17.608,00:30:18.817,Kill 'im.
00:30:18.942,00:30:20.152,Come on.
00:30:24.030,00:30:25.282,Guards!
00:30:51.183,00:30:53.644,They will not break.
00:30:54.687,00:30:56.313,Speak to Batiatus.
00:30:57.314,00:31:01.234,You have his ear.
00:31:01.360,00:31:02.611,He would not allow it.
00:31:02.736,00:31:04.196,You will not even make attempt?
00:31:04.321,00:31:05.447,You are fortunate only to be chained.
00:31:05.572,00:31:10.452,To petition Dominus with such insanity would only provoke further punishment.
00:31:10.577,00:31:12.245,How would that help your cause?
00:31:12.371,00:31:14.873,My cause is lost.
00:31:14.998,00:31:16.542,Ashur found only blood.
00:31:16.667,00:31:18.251,No bodies.
00:31:18.377,00:31:21.338,Which means your wife and child may yet be living.
00:31:21.463,00:31:23.757,"The gods punish me, for failing them."
00:31:23.882,00:31:26.009,The gods rarely take note of fools.
00:31:27.511,00:31:32.015,"Now, pull head from ass and use it for once!"
00:31:32.140,00:31:35.185,"Where would your wife and boy flee, if set upon?"
00:31:35.310,00:31:36.687,Think.
00:31:45.779,00:31:47.531,Naevia?
00:31:54.162,00:31:55.914,The hour is late.
00:31:56.039,00:31:58.291,You should be in your cell.
00:31:58.417,00:32:01.169,I could not sleep.
00:32:01.294,00:32:04.548,My mind is full of thoughts of the arena.
00:32:07.175,00:32:08.719,Embrace the sands of time.
00:32:14.224,00:32:16.852,Capua already has its champion.
00:32:16.976,00:32:25.277,"Spartacus bears the title, but I look towards a man of honor to regain it."
00:32:37.038,00:32:39.124,If you value your life...
00:32:39.249,00:32:42.628,never awaken a gladiator.
00:32:44.838,00:32:46.882,Domina sent me...
00:32:47.006,00:32:48.508,Return the way you came.
00:32:56.015,00:32:58.017,Why do you refuse me?
00:33:03.189,00:33:04.733,Am I not pleasing...
00:33:04.858,00:33:11.698,I have no desire to lie with a woman who has been commanded to do so.
00:33:11.824,00:33:15.034,And what do you think will happen if I fail such a command?
00:33:19.164,00:33:20.666,Stay then.
00:33:25.587,00:33:27.339,On the floor.
00:33:38.099,00:33:41.728,Is there nothing I can do for the Champion of Capua?
00:33:46.859,00:33:51.237,There is one desire I would have serviced.
00:33:53.072,00:33:55.116,If you are able...
00:34:22.310,00:34:25.188,I wonder to the cause.
00:34:31.403,00:34:33.446,He made...
00:34:33.572,00:34:35.699,many demands of me.
00:34:35.824,00:34:37.200,"Many demands, eh?!"
00:34:39.661,00:34:42.706,Our Thracian is ready to stud.
00:34:42.831,00:34:45.584,I shall make arrangements for this very night.
00:34:45.709,00:34:49.796,"And when the sun rises, we will have road to Marcus Crassus."
00:34:49.922,00:34:53.299,"What of Ilithyia, and her desire for Crixus?"
00:34:55.677,00:34:57.804,I've already set plans in motion.
00:35:10.358,00:35:12.402,The pup bares his teeth.
00:35:27.459,00:35:30.545,Sleep did not come?
00:35:30.670,00:35:32.380,Nor is it deserved.
00:35:34.257,00:35:37.761,Embrace dreams when the sun falls.
00:35:37.886,00:35:39.137,I have news.
00:35:39.262,00:35:41.473,- Aurelia...?
00:35:42.641,00:35:45.936,"But I have dispatched Mira, one of the house slaves, to look for her."
00:35:46.061,00:35:48.313,And your son.
00:35:50.941,00:35:54.319,How do you manage such a thing?
00:35:54.444,00:35:55.988,She was sent by Domina.
00:35:56.113,00:35:59.449,To prepare me for certain...
00:35:59.574,00:36:01.868,duties required of a champion.
00:36:05.204,00:36:07.582,"So the gods throw women at you, now!"
00:36:09.542,00:36:12.295,Ahh! Ahh!
00:36:31.148,00:36:33.608,Your form returns.
00:36:33.733,00:36:36.361,Pair with Hamilcar.
00:36:48.040,00:36:50.291,It appears Duro has lost his brother.
00:36:53.003,00:36:54.629,Better that than his head.
00:36:56.673,00:36:57.632,It's done?
00:36:57.757,00:36:59.926,The whore Despoina fucks no more.
00:37:01.678,00:37:04.347,Nor the man inside her when I slit her throat.
00:37:06.224,00:37:07.559,It was not Solonius.
00:37:11.396,00:37:12.898,Phew.
00:37:13.023,00:37:14.983,Whose face do I look upon?
00:37:15.108,00:37:16.442,Kastor.
00:37:16.568,00:37:18.486,One of Solonius' men.
00:37:21.198,00:37:23.075,Send it to Solonius.
00:37:23.200,00:37:25.493,Let him savor the relief of escaping death.
00:37:26.369,00:37:27.954,For the moment.
00:37:45.764,00:37:48.558,You will be bedding a proper Roman woman.
00:37:48.683,00:37:50.185,One far above your station.
00:37:50.309,00:37:53.021,"Heed my words, that you not offend her."
00:37:53.146,00:37:54.106,"Yes, Domina."
00:37:54.231,00:37:57.984,"Speak not a word, nor make a sound, save one of pleasure."
00:37:59.945,00:38:04.490,"Follow her lead, anticipate her desires then fulfill them. Vigorously."
00:38:04.616,00:38:05.992,"Yes, Domina."
00:38:06.118,00:38:08.036,"In the arena, you are Champion of Capua."
00:38:09.246,00:38:12.665,"But tonight, you a common slave."
00:38:12.791,00:38:14.667,To do as commanded.
00:38:14.793,00:38:16.086,Are we clear?
00:38:19.131,00:38:21.507,"We are clear, Domina."
00:38:21.633,00:38:24.302,They will prepare you for the festivities.
00:38:24.427,00:38:26.012,Wait until summoned.
00:38:33.603,00:38:35.354,Fetch the best wine.
00:38:35.480,00:38:39.067,I want our guest well plied when she arrives.
00:38:39.192,00:38:40.652,Domina.
00:38:51.621,00:38:53.290,Where were you last night?
00:38:53.414,00:38:56.251,I waited almost to the point of detection.
00:38:56.375,00:38:57.335,I could not break away.
00:38:57.460,00:38:58.878,I was tending to Domina.
00:38:59.004,00:39:01.089,Domina?
00:39:01.214,00:39:02.548,Or maybe that guard I saw you with today.
00:39:02.674,00:39:03.883,You are mistaken..
00:39:04.009,00:39:07.179,I am not blind.
00:39:07.304,00:39:13.977,You where touching his arm and laughing and the way he gazed at you...
00:39:14.102,00:39:17.814,"If you are not blind, then you surely see that Hector gazes at all women in the same fashion."
00:39:17.939,00:39:20.984,I give no shit about other women.
00:39:22.568,00:39:24.070,You shame me.
00:39:26.323,00:39:30.702,"You shame yourself, with thoughts of imaginary slights."
00:39:30.827,00:39:32.578,I know what I saw.
00:39:32.704,00:39:34.706,No. You do not!
00:39:38.751,00:39:40.419,and nor did Hector.
00:39:45.383,00:39:47.260,His key?!
00:39:47.385,00:39:50.013,The purpose of my smile and touch.
00:39:50.138,00:39:51.931,The only one he received.
00:40:01.233,00:40:05.278,I have but a moment before I must return with Domina's wine.
00:40:05.403,00:40:09.532,Use it to apologize for ever thinking..
00:40:11.868,00:40:14.913,You are my heart...
00:40:15.038,00:40:17.874,I will never doubt the beating of it again.
00:43:34.571,00:43:36.030,"Oh, apologies, Licinia."
00:43:36.155,00:43:39.367,We appear to have arrived before Ilithyia's finished with Spartacus.
00:43:50.086,00:43:52.464,NO!
00:43:52.589,00:43:53.756,Guards!
00:44:07.895,00:44:13.985,"Oh, would this not set every tongue in Rome wagging."
00:44:16.488,00:44:19.324,The wife of Legatus Claudius Glaber!
00:44:19.449,00:44:23.453,"Fucking Spartacus, the man that nearly ruined him!"
00:44:23.578,00:44:25.455,"It is a scandal, is it not?"
00:44:25.580,00:44:29.375,The most splendid I have ever heard.
00:44:31.127,00:44:32.462,Stop laughing!
00:44:35.798,00:44:38.134,Stop laughing!!
00:44:40.512,00:44:42.847,STOP LAUGHING!
00:45:09.915,00:45:11.959,What were you thinking?
00:45:12.084,00:45:13.002,She slights me at every turn.
00:45:13.127,00:45:14.879,I wished only to teach her a lesson.
00:45:15.004,00:45:16.589,By pairing her with Spartacus?!
00:45:16.713,00:45:19.842,"If my husband will not defend my honor, I am forced to do so myself."
00:45:19.967,00:45:21.093,Honor?
00:45:21.219,00:45:24.514,Is that why the cousin to Marcus Crassus lays dead in our fucking house?!
00:45:24.639,00:45:26.265,Was not my intent.
00:45:26.391,00:45:29.644,Your intent matters for nothing.
00:45:29.768,00:45:31.770,Oh fuck!
00:45:35.358,00:45:36.859,We are undone!
00:45:36.984,00:45:37.943,No.
00:45:38.069,00:45:40.279,Licinia came alone.
00:45:40.405,00:45:42.156,She told no one of her purpose.
00:45:42.281,00:45:46.244,- No one?
00:45:46.369,00:45:48.871,There is nothing to connect her with the House of Batiatus...
00:45:48.996,00:45:51.207,Once the body is disposed of.
00:45:52.667,00:45:54.627,What of Ilithyia?
00:45:54.751,00:45:56.921,"Oh, I'll take care of her."
00:46:10.602,00:46:15.772,"Apologies, It was an unfortunate mistake, coupling you with Glaber's wife."
00:46:15.898,00:46:18.568,"Know that it was not my intent, nor of my knowledge."
00:46:19.776,00:46:22.488,It is I that owes apology.
00:46:22.614,00:46:28.536,"For a moment my hands were not my own, but those of a man who no longer exists."
00:46:31.456,00:46:34.791,Let us not speak of this night again.
00:46:34.917,00:46:36.294,Spartacus.
00:46:37.086,00:46:38.421,Your loyalty.
00:46:40.673,00:46:44.176,It honors this ludus.
00:46:49.056,00:46:51.100,I did not mean...
00:46:53.810,00:46:58.650,"No, course you didn't."
00:46:58.775,00:47:01.277,The way she laughed at me....
00:47:01.402,00:47:04.697,You said I was to lie with Crixus.
00:47:04.821,00:47:08.326,Why did you give me Spartacus?
00:47:08.451,00:47:11.788,Why would you do such a thing?
00:47:11.912,00:47:14.123,You ask what you already know answer to.
00:47:22.340,00:47:25.968,My husband will see me dead for this...
00:47:26.093,00:47:27.886,You have killed me...
00:47:28.012,00:47:30.431,No.
00:47:30.556,00:47:32.391,I have brought us closer.
00:47:34.185,00:47:36.061,No one will ever know what happened here tonight.
00:47:36.187,00:47:39.649,Licinia's body will never be found.
00:47:40.650,00:47:42.109,You're protected.
00:47:42.234,00:47:44.362,No.
00:47:44.487,00:47:45.655,They will know.
00:47:45.780,00:47:47.657,They will see the deed in my eyes.
00:47:47.782,00:47:51.243,Then you'll stay here with me.
00:47:51.369,00:47:54.831,Until your eyes are clear.
00:47:54.955,00:47:58.167,"We've had our differences, however veiled."
00:47:58.292,00:48:02.004,But I've come to see what a valuable friend you are.
00:48:13.974,00:48:16.352,This will be our little secret.
00:00:28.278,00:00:29.363,SPAR-TA-CUS!
00:00:29.363,00:00:31.907,SPAR-TA-CUS!
00:00:38.455,00:00:40.207,They roar your name.
00:00:45.086,00:00:48.173,"Or mourn it, if your mind is absent the task."
00:01:34.344,00:01:35.554,Shield!!
00:01:54.197,00:01:55.532,Oh yes!
00:01:55.532,00:01:59.202,"Even chained to an inferior gladiator, Spartacus prevails!"
00:01:59.202,00:02:01.705,One would expect no less from the Champion of Capua!
00:02:01.705,00:02:04.666,See how he ignites the crowd!
00:02:04.666,00:02:07.836,His presence at your son's birthday will be the talk of the Republic.
00:02:07.836,00:02:11.590,Ha!
00:02:11.590,00:02:18.639,"When I put on the Toga Virilis and passed into manhood, it was a stuffy, formal ceremony ridden with corpses and hags."
00:02:20.515,00:02:24.394,"Lulled our guests to slumber, some never to awaken!"
00:02:24.394,00:02:26.563,We would not have it so for Numerius.
00:02:26.563,00:02:30.734,"He's been clamoring for a pair of your finest, to battle in exhibition at his celebration."
00:02:30.734,00:02:33.278,Well we would see him well satisfied.
00:02:33.278,00:02:36.197,And by extension his noble father.
00:02:36.197,00:02:42.746,"Though thought strikes if you hold the celebration beneath my humble roof, then your boy can bear close witness to all my gladiators."
00:02:42.746,00:02:44.957,"Could we, Father?"
00:02:46.500,00:02:50.504,And the extra cost for such generosity?
00:02:50.504,00:02:52.631,A favor between friends.
00:02:52.631,00:02:53.757,Received with much gratitude!
00:02:53.757,00:02:54.925,Uh!
00:02:57.511,00:02:59.429,You're next Spartacus.
00:03:02.724,00:03:04.559,Come here.
00:03:16.738,00:03:19.282,Are you certain it won't cause imposition?
00:03:19.282,00:03:21.409,Place it from your thoughts.
00:03:21.409,00:03:23.829,A boy becomes a man but once in his life.
00:03:26.665,00:03:29.793,He never ceases to tire of the games.
00:03:29.793,00:03:34.548,He's of the same obsessive ilk as Ilithyia regarding blood and sport.
00:03:34.548,00:03:37.718,Her absence comes as surprise.
00:03:37.718,00:03:41.221,"Has she returned to Rome, absent farewells?"
00:03:41.221,00:03:42.472,No.
00:03:42.472,00:03:44.516,She has been feeling...
00:03:45.726,00:03:47.602,"Nothing serious, I hope?"
00:03:47.602,00:03:50.522,"It will pass, as all things born of a weak stomach."
00:04:16.381,00:04:17.883,Then we shall aim higher.
00:04:31.354,00:04:33.314,Pull!
00:04:51.583,00:04:52.793,Oh!
00:04:52.793,00:04:55.420,Oh yeah!
00:05:15.523,00:05:17.358,I've never seen anything like it!
00:05:33.750,00:05:35.043,Yeah!!
00:05:42.676,00:05:43.802,Get up.
00:05:46.847,00:05:50.517,Spartacus!
00:05:51.476,00:05:52.978,Live to fight another day.
00:05:57.649,00:06:00.568,It pains me to watch others claim your laurels.
00:06:00.568,00:06:04.031,Your pain shall increase if you continue to stand beside me.
00:06:07.784,00:06:09.077,"Yeah, well done brother."
00:06:09.077,00:06:11.705,Well done.
00:06:14.958,00:06:16.417,You fought well today.
00:06:16.417,00:06:19.296,"The gods favored me, to count you as ally."
00:06:19.296,00:06:21.798,Their favor extends beyond the arena.
00:06:24.885,00:06:27.721,Aurelia...
00:06:38.106,00:06:40.984,"Ah, I feared I would never hold you again."
00:06:40.984,00:06:44.321,Ashur said he found only blood when I sent him to you with message.
00:06:44.321,00:06:45.364,Titus had returned.
00:06:45.364,00:06:47.032,Did he hurt you?
00:06:47.032,00:06:49.034,I will see his heart from his fucking chest..
00:06:49.034,00:06:51.745,The blood was not mine.
00:06:51.745,00:06:55.207,"I cut him, deep and low."
00:06:55.207,00:06:58.459,He will never force himself on a woman again.
00:07:03.965,00:07:08.095,"The slave girl found me there, by Spartacus' direction."
00:07:08.095,00:07:10.138,Thank the gods you're safe.
00:07:14.726,00:07:17.729,Where were they when Titus first laid hands on me?
00:07:19.814,00:07:21.983,I still carry his child.
00:07:25.946,00:07:29.657,"Nothings changed, Varro."
00:07:29.657,00:07:32.619,The entire world has changed.
00:07:32.619,00:07:35.747,And I along with it.
00:07:35.747,00:07:37.582,The child.
00:07:37.582,00:07:41.753,"It springs from your belly, a part of you."
00:07:41.753,00:07:43.755,I would love it as such...
00:07:43.755,00:07:44.881,if you would have it so.
00:08:12.867,00:08:15.954,Your absence was noticed.
00:08:15.954,00:08:17.747,Absence...?
00:08:17.747,00:08:19.791,The games.
00:08:19.791,00:08:21.751,You were supposed to join us.
00:08:21.751,00:08:24.671,I could not face prying eyes.
00:08:24.671,00:08:27.674,One look into mine and they would have full knowledge.
00:08:27.674,00:08:30.927,Licinia's blood...
00:08:30.927,00:08:33.596,Her skull steeped between my fingers...
00:08:33.596,00:08:37.934,"Jupiter's cock, would you come to grips!"
00:08:37.934,00:08:42.939,"Licinia's murder and your part in it, have been concealed."
00:08:49.529,00:08:50.864,Would you have me do?
00:08:50.864,00:08:55.994,"Appear yourself, absent conscience of deeds unknown."
00:09:00.874,00:09:03.084,The venue turns to my husband as host.
00:09:03.084,00:09:07.755,"You won't even have to move from under this roof, my hand ever present to steady your resolve."
00:09:09.674,00:09:13.011,You will guide me through this?
00:09:13.011,00:09:16.597,As trusted friend.
00:09:16.597,00:09:19.809,"And as such, I require favor."
00:09:19.809,00:09:25.773,We would swell the ranks of celebration with these noble citizens.
00:09:25.773,00:09:30.904,Ones I am certain would accept invite from the daughter of senator Albinius.
00:09:34.908,00:09:38.286,Gather yourself.
00:09:38.286,00:09:39.913,And see it done.
00:10:08.483,00:10:11.903,I owe you more than I can ever repay.
00:10:11.903,00:10:14.030,If you had not sent Mira to find my wife...
00:10:14.030,00:10:15.449,"She has taken you back, then?"
00:10:15.449,00:10:18.952,And I will yet be the man she deserves.
00:10:18.952,00:10:22.163,"If not, I shall remind you of your shortcomings."
00:10:22.163,00:10:25.208,Oh. It lifts the heart.
00:10:25.208,00:10:28.836,To see a man reunited with his woman.
00:10:28.836,00:10:32.173,Now you'll have someone to weep for you when you die.
00:10:32.173,00:10:34.593,"If I fall, it will be in the arena."
00:10:34.593,00:10:36.261,As a gladiator.
00:10:36.261,00:10:39.097,"You remember what that is like, do you not?"
00:10:41.266,00:10:43.017,"Spartacus, Crixus."
00:10:43.017,00:10:44.436,you are summoned.
00:10:48.189,00:10:50.108,Numerius has chosen.
00:10:50.108,00:10:55.447,He insisted on drinking in the spectacle of present glories pitted against the past.
00:10:55.447,00:10:57.991,"And his thirst shall be satisfied, Dominus."
00:10:57.991,00:10:59.951,Keep to mind this is an exhibition.
00:10:59.951,00:11:01.953,"Blood may be spilled, but only for show."
00:11:01.953,00:11:05.706,Serious punishment will be meeted out to the man who caused them.
00:11:05.706,00:11:07.834,"We shall serve you with honor, Dominus."
00:11:07.834,00:11:10.170,I expect no less.
00:11:10.170,00:11:11.463,Return to quarters.
00:11:14.007,00:11:16.926,"Spartacus, remain."
00:11:16.926,00:11:18.261,What make you of Crixus?
00:11:18.261,00:11:21.055,"Numerius insisted upon him, yet with his wounds barely sealed..."
00:11:21.055,00:11:23.141,He believes himself ready.
00:11:23.141,00:11:24.518,To a fault.
00:11:24.518,00:11:26.436,The ego bruises deeper than the flesh.
00:11:28.938,00:11:32.150,"He brought this house great honor, not long ago."
00:11:32.150,00:11:33.818,Do not overly embarrass the man.
00:11:35.778,00:11:37.822,I will give Numerius a show.
00:11:37.822,00:11:40.325,Nothing more.
00:11:40.325,00:11:46.705,"When I put on the Toga Virilis, it was in this very room, surrounded by my father's champions."
00:11:46.705,00:11:53.630,Even then I knew that one day my own titans would eclipse them all.
00:11:59.302,00:12:00.845,Ugh?
00:12:04.265,00:12:06.059,You honor me.
00:12:07.894,00:12:09.937,You stand above all others.
00:12:13.191,00:12:15.193,grrrr!
00:12:33.086,00:12:35.672,You have been avoiding me.
00:12:35.672,00:12:38.216,I have been tending my duties.
00:12:38.216,00:12:40.385,Your manner hardens.
00:12:40.385,00:12:44.305,"I prefer it soft, as the moment we shared not so long ago..."
00:12:44.305,00:12:48.059,You mistake smile and friendly touch beyond intent.
00:12:48.059,00:12:53.981,"And the key that went missing from my clasp, after your friendly touch?"
00:12:53.981,00:12:58.278,"It did not by mistake draw into your palm, did it?"
00:12:59.487,00:13:01.989,It did not.
00:13:01.989,00:13:05.034,And yet you tense from question.
00:13:05.034,00:13:08.413,Such reaction warrants fair search...
00:13:08.413,00:13:10.415,My hands service Domina alone.
00:13:10.415,00:13:14.001,She would not be pleased to have yours laid upon me without her consent.
00:13:17.255,00:13:19.966,or to learn a guard has misplaced his key.
00:13:22.801,00:13:24.304,I would not have it so.
00:13:27.307,00:13:30.268,You have reputation for your handling of women.
00:13:31.185,00:13:36.524,"Seek your loss among them, and do not press me again with accusation."
00:13:48.202,00:13:50.079,You trust Ilithyia not to come unhinged..
00:13:50.079,00:13:51.914,in front of the Magistrate?
00:13:51.914,00:13:53.832,I shall keep watchful eyes upon her.
00:13:53.832,00:13:56.877,"More watchful than the last, I pray."
00:13:56.877,00:13:59.297,Everything worked to our advantage.
00:13:59.297,00:14:03.926,"Ilithyia's in our debt, and through collection we gained access to the most noble of families."
00:14:03.926,00:14:05.886,She attends to the list?
00:14:05.886,00:14:12.018,"She will draw all to the Magistrate's celebration, so artfully placed within our walls."
00:14:17.273,00:14:25.365,"After the exhibition between Spartacus and Crixus has ignited his son, I will broach the Magistrate on subject of political office."
00:14:25.365,00:14:27.784,And be well received.
00:14:27.784,00:14:29.076,Ha!
00:14:29.076,00:14:36.334,To behold Solonius' face when he sees me consort with the highest echelon of Capua.
00:14:36.334,00:14:37.836,Solonius?
00:14:37.836,00:14:39.212,Well how should he witness such a thing?
00:14:39.212,00:14:40.797,By invitation.
00:14:40.797,00:14:45.051,I desire his eyes upon me when I am anointed by the Magistrate.
00:14:45.051,00:14:49.305,"I want him to see that as my fortunes rise, his plummet."
00:14:50.598,00:14:53.518,You taunt an injured snake.
00:14:53.518,00:14:55.562,One that may yet turn and strike.
00:14:55.562,00:14:57.313,Ease your mind.
00:14:57.313,00:15:01.317,The serpent's head will be struck from its body in due course.
00:15:01.317,00:15:05.363,"Ha, and Solonius will never see it coming."
00:15:35.017,00:15:37.311,"So, you and Crixus battling as entertainment, eh?"
00:15:37.311,00:15:38.979,Something the boy will never forget.
00:15:38.979,00:15:40.690,It is only exhibition.
00:15:40.690,00:15:44.068,Dominus gave strict instructions to avoid grievous injury.
00:16:10.428,00:16:12.472,Do not believe he was listening.
00:16:20.438,00:16:22.273,Your Gaul is restored.
00:16:24.191,00:16:26.402,He is not alone.
00:16:26.402,00:16:29.196,The sun has revived what the night had withered.
00:16:29.196,00:16:32.283,Due to kindness of a dear friend.
00:16:34.619,00:16:37.747,The Magistrate's celebration will swell with all names provided.
00:16:40.458,00:16:43.419,Gratitude.
00:16:43.419,00:16:45.797,Would that I had words to multiply it in response.
00:16:54.514,00:16:59.769,Yet the value of a friend cannot be expressed by the clever grouping of letters.
00:17:01.980,00:17:07.610,"It is blood and flesh, granting life to the world."
00:17:17.161,00:17:20.456,"You submit like a fucking girl, begging for a cock to split her open."
00:17:20.456,00:17:21.958,I was bested.
00:17:21.958,00:17:23.877,Rise and fight till your final breath.
00:17:23.877,00:17:25.795,Or prove the name brother false.
00:17:29.298,00:17:32.593,Heard of opportunities in Sicilia.
00:17:32.593,00:17:35.262,"Had I been wise, we would have moved there to escape my debts."
00:17:35.262,00:17:37.473,Yet the advice of my wife fell short of its mark.
00:17:37.473,00:17:42.436,"It is a distance to travel, from a woman's mouth to a man's ears."
00:17:44.188,00:17:49.027,"I shall close the gap, from this point forward."
00:17:49.027,00:17:53.155,Aurelia tells me Sicilia is an island blessed by the gods.
00:17:53.155,00:17:56.325,"You must visit us there, when you gain freedom."
00:17:56.325,00:17:59.537,I no longer concern myself with thoughts beyond these walls.
00:17:59.537,00:18:01.539,And nor should you.
00:18:01.539,00:18:04.375,A true champion dreams only of the arena.
00:18:07.378,00:18:10.715,And what does one dream of when he's no longer champion?
00:18:15.177,00:18:19.557,Regaining the title from the thief who stole it from me.
00:18:19.557,00:18:21.100,He stole nothing.
00:18:21.100,00:18:25.605,"If I am a thief, the crime was witnessed by all of Capua."
00:18:25.605,00:18:27.189,And is still celebrated to this day.
00:18:28.441,00:18:30.276,Spartacus!
00:18:31.778,00:18:33.780,You are summoned.
00:18:46.459,00:18:52.506,"The Magistrate will arrive tomorrow well in advance of his guests, to ensure that preparations are to his standards."
00:18:52.506,00:18:56.552,"While I reassure him, I would have you tend the boy."
00:18:56.552,00:19:02.100,"It's imperative that he is well satisfied, and by proximity his noble father."
00:19:02.100,00:19:04.727,The name Batiatus will be honored.
00:19:04.727,00:19:06.604,And envied throughout the Republic.
00:19:12.610,00:19:14.570,You move unwisely.
00:19:16.322,00:19:17.615,You play?
00:19:17.615,00:19:21.160,"I've had occasion, during my time with the auxiliary."
00:19:21.160,00:19:24.580,"By all means, grace us with your knowledge."
00:19:27.041,00:19:28.375,Mm.
00:19:37.593,00:19:40.638,It appears our champion has no head for games of strategy.
00:19:46.477,00:19:48.562,"Mm, battles maybe lost..."
00:19:48.562,00:19:51.858,and yet the war concludes in victory.
00:19:54.568,00:19:57.571,Ahh! Treacherous fuck.
00:19:59.657,00:20:02.118,Played like a true Roman.
00:20:02.118,00:20:03.703,Fall from your chair.
00:20:14.714,00:20:19.135,"The Syrian could swindle the scales from a snake, but never command a charge."
00:20:19.135,00:20:20.302,Come!
00:20:20.302,00:20:21.804,Let us have contest between men...
00:20:37.070,00:20:39.530,"Oh, your touch has been missed."
00:20:39.530,00:20:42.491,And thoughts of yours consume me.
00:20:42.491,00:20:48.455,Soon you will feel the hands of a champion once again upon you.
00:20:48.455,00:20:50.666,The match with Spartacus is but exhibition.
00:20:50.666,00:20:53.836,I know the crowd as my heart.
00:20:53.836,00:20:57.673,"They will yearn for blood, and I shall give it to them."
00:20:59.884,00:21:01.761,Dominus forbids injury.
00:21:05.431,00:21:06.807,is to risk your own.
00:21:06.807,00:21:09.810,This is my life.
00:21:09.810,00:21:13.022,"If not Champion, I am nothing."
00:21:16.192,00:21:20.780,"Then I must be without my mind, to love only the man."
00:21:20.780,00:21:22.573,Yes.
00:21:24.491,00:21:26.744,And I relish your madness.
00:22:09.954,00:22:11.705,Ah! Fuck the heavens!
00:22:13.624,00:22:16.085,How can you keep besting a man so far above your station?
00:22:17.878,00:22:21.632,I sprung from my mother with sword in hand.
00:22:21.632,00:22:25.845,"The ways of battle are second nature, passed down from father to son."
00:22:28.889,00:22:32.476,I regret my own father never saw the advantage of military glory.
00:22:33.644,00:22:35.980,Never saw the spoils that could be won.
00:22:35.980,00:22:38.774,"The patronage, the alliances forged had he taken up arms."
00:22:41.652,00:22:44.655,He aspired to be no further than what he was.
00:22:45.865,00:22:49.785,"A simple lanista, far from Rome."
00:22:49.785,00:22:52.621,"You and I, however."
00:22:52.621,00:22:57.043,"We have fashioned wings, to raise us higher than the muck and mire of heritage."
00:22:57.043,00:22:59.920,Higher than our fathers could never imagine.
00:23:02.715,00:23:04.800,Quintus?
00:23:04.800,00:23:06.886,What stirs such a vision from her dreams?
00:23:06.886,00:23:08.888,My husband not beside me.
00:23:10.681,00:23:13.267,Spartacus was helping me hone my game.
00:23:13.267,00:23:17.188,Over a cup of wine?...Hmm!
00:23:20.941,00:23:22.609,Gratitude for the instruction.
00:23:31.535,00:23:32.953,To share drink with a slave...
00:23:32.953,00:23:35.873,I drink with the Champion of Capua.
00:23:35.873,00:23:37.666,Crixus was Champion.
00:23:37.666,00:23:38.751,Yet no cup was ever raised with him.
00:23:38.751,00:23:39.919,Argh!
00:23:39.919,00:23:42.755,Crixus is a brute.
00:23:42.755,00:23:44.715,Spartacus is different.
00:23:44.715,00:23:47.927,We owe our good fortune to the man.
00:23:47.927,00:23:53.849,He's beneath you and tomorrow we play host to Capua's finest.
00:23:53.849,00:23:55.893,Such behavior would be spat upon.
00:23:55.893,00:23:59.563,They spit only to stroke their own cocks.
00:23:59.563,00:24:04.902,"Spartacus is the reason the Magistrate graces our house, along with all the shits that follow."
00:24:04.902,00:24:09.323,They come to see you.
00:24:09.323,00:24:12.450,A man ascended to the heavens.
00:24:12.450,00:24:15.704,And Spartacus is merely the beast that you ride upon.
00:24:18.791,00:24:21.501,You and Varro fought as if brothers.
00:24:21.501,00:24:22.836,Your victory was a glorious sight.
00:24:22.836,00:24:24.922,"Did you see the key, huh?"
00:24:24.922,00:24:26.340,Huh?
00:24:27.591,00:24:28.634,Spartacus.
00:24:28.634,00:24:29.885,Still your tongue.
00:24:31.887,00:24:33.139,None which concerns you.
00:24:33.139,00:24:34.974,She is known to me.
00:24:34.974,00:24:37.517,This one is known to every cock in the villa.
00:24:37.517,00:24:38.644,Move off.
00:24:38.644,00:24:40.687,Tell me her grievance.
00:24:40.687,00:24:43.816,I gave you command.
00:24:43.816,00:24:45.109,Stop!
00:24:47.861,00:24:49.989,What is the fucking meaning of this?
00:24:49.989,00:24:51.740,Speak!
00:24:51.740,00:24:54.576,Your man attacks Mira without cause.
00:24:54.576,00:24:58.998,What reason have you for laying hands on one of my slaves?
00:24:58.998,00:25:00.124,The girl is a thief.
00:25:00.124,00:25:02.376,I stole nothing!
00:25:02.376,00:25:03.961,What exactly do you believe she has stolen?
00:25:08.548,00:25:09.883,Nothing of worth.
00:25:16.015,00:25:17.850,You overstep.
00:25:17.850,00:25:19.517,"A month's wages, forfeited."
00:25:19.517,00:25:23.563,Press further and coin will be replaced by blood.
00:25:23.563,00:25:24.857,Remove yourself.
00:25:24.857,00:25:26.192,Dominus.
00:25:28.986,00:25:30.112,Apologies.
00:25:30.112,00:25:32.906,Do not fucking speak!
00:25:32.906,00:25:37.786,"I defend your worth to my wife, only to turn and find you shitting in my fucking house."
00:25:37.786,00:25:44.542,"If the Toga Virilis were not tomorrow, I would have you lashed until the flesh peeled from your back."
00:25:44.542,00:25:49.173,"Lay hands on one of my guards again, and you will receive far worse."
00:25:52.051,00:25:53.635,Dominus.
00:26:03.770,00:26:06.065,You attack a guard yet escape punishment?
00:26:07.941,00:26:10.986,Being Champion is not without advantage.
00:26:10.986,00:26:13.197,I must remember to stay close to your side.
00:26:16.658,00:26:19.036,Perhaps a swath of your good fortune will rub off upon me.
00:26:21.080,00:26:24.750,Your efforts would be better focused protecting your flank.
00:26:24.750,00:26:27.627,"Oh, fuck!"
00:26:31.757,00:26:33.551,Magistrate Calavius!
00:26:33.551,00:26:37.637,"The House of Batiatus welcomes you, on this glorious day!"
00:26:37.637,00:26:40.057,"A young boy enters my doors, but leaves a man!"
00:26:40.057,00:26:41.517,Gratitude for your hospitalities.
00:26:42.809,00:26:44.103,As are we all.
00:26:44.103,00:26:45.812,Ilithyia!
00:26:47.231,00:26:49.149,I'd begun to fear for your health.
00:26:49.149,00:26:52.027,A momentary lapse.
00:26:49.149,00:26:54.988,I've been tended to with most compassionate care within these walls.
00:26:54.988,00:26:56.532,Where are the gladiators?
00:26:56.532,00:26:58.075,Numerius.
00:26:58.075,00:26:59.868,"He couldn't sleep last night, for excitement."
00:26:59.868,00:27:03.038,Who can blame him?!
00:26:59.868,00:27:04.998,"To stand among the greatest titans of the Republic, his to command."
00:27:04.998,00:27:06.792,Mine? Really?
00:27:06.792,00:27:11.255,Each of my proud warriors has been instructed to regard your orders as if from my own lips.
00:27:13.299,00:27:15.008,As he should!
00:27:15.008,00:27:20.847,Even more so when he hears the Champion of Capua himself has given you a tour of the ludus.
00:27:20.847,00:27:21.848,Spartacus?!
00:27:21.848,00:27:24.184,"He awaits your presence, with permission of your father..."
00:27:24.184,00:27:28.188,I would have better fortune reigning Apollo's horses.
00:27:28.188,00:27:30.316,Guards!
00:27:28.188,00:27:31.942,Escort young Numerius to the training square.
00:27:34.069,00:27:35.821,I've never seen him in higher spirits.
00:27:35.821,00:27:39.074,The house of Batiatus has such an effect.
00:27:39.074,00:27:41.619,Have you ever witnessed a view from their balcony?
00:27:41.619,00:27:43.954,It simply overwhelms the senses.
00:27:43.954,00:27:45.205,Come.
00:27:45.205,00:27:48.041,Let us gaze upon Capua's perfection.
00:27:48.041,00:27:52.171,And give the men private moment to discuss how ravishing their women are.
00:27:57.050,00:27:58.676,Ilithyia resides with you?
00:27:58.676,00:27:59.886,For the moment.
00:27:59.886,00:28:01.721,A valued friend.
00:28:01.721,00:28:04.141,With connection to the senate in both husband and father.
00:28:04.141,00:28:05.267,Value indeed.
00:28:05.267,00:28:08.479,One must choose one's company with exceeding care.
00:28:08.479,00:28:11.148,Or else be dragged down by them.
00:28:11.148,00:28:13.984,Preparations are in order?
00:28:13.984,00:28:15.152,Set as if the boy was my own.
00:28:15.152,00:28:17.279,Erase all concern.
00:28:17.279,00:28:20.157,This night will be etched in the memories of all in attendance.
00:28:27.164,00:28:35.755,"My sword may deliver the final blow, but a gladiator's fate is for the crowd and the editor to decide."
00:28:39.843,00:28:42.762,You have no wall over by the cliff!
00:28:42.762,00:28:46.016,The very reason I find it best not to train there.
00:28:46.016,00:28:48.143,Has anyone ever fallen below?
00:28:48.143,00:28:50.062,I've witnessed but one.
00:28:50.062,00:28:52.189,Come.
00:28:52.189,00:28:55.067,It's been a long time since last we trained.
00:28:55.067,00:28:56.860,Let us see what you remember.
00:29:15.170,00:29:16.296,and this is what greets him?
00:29:27.974,00:29:30.227,I meant a real gladiator.
00:29:40.820,00:29:43.156,Crixus shows impeccable form.
00:29:43.156,00:29:47.160,"Mm, I shall prove otherwise at your ceremony tonight."
00:29:47.160,00:29:49.371,Anyone else dare challenge?
00:29:54.793,00:29:57.045,Our fight is not yet finished.
00:29:57.045,00:29:58.297,"Stand down, pup."
00:29:58.297,00:30:00.591,Before your shriveling cock wets the sand.
00:30:11.268,00:30:12.770,The man is beaten.
00:30:12.770,00:30:15.314,"In body, perhaps."
00:30:17.149,00:30:23.614,"Yet confrontation is often not won by force, by will."
00:31:07.073,00:31:09.326,Enough!
00:31:34.100,00:31:36.520,"The man is soundly defeated, yet treated as victor?"
00:31:38.271,00:31:40.899,A sign of respect.
00:31:40.899,00:31:42.359,For his courage.
00:31:42.359,00:31:44.027,See him to the medicus.
00:31:52.369,00:31:54.204,Is everyday like this?
00:32:03.547,00:32:07.259,I was unaware you possessed such a skilled hand at Latrunculi.
00:32:07.259,00:32:10.262,Well I consider myself a student of military strategy.
00:32:10.262,00:32:14.349,"To win, one must maneuver to catch ones opponent unawares."
00:32:14.349,00:32:19.271,"As it is in war, so it is in politics."
00:32:19.271,00:32:22.107,"Hm, another subject of my interest."
00:32:22.107,00:32:23.191,Perhaps..
00:32:23.191,00:32:25.193,Father!
00:32:25.193,00:32:27.279,"Spartacus gave me his sword, so I could practice!"
00:32:27.279,00:32:29.239,"Numerius, you are filthy!"
00:32:29.239,00:32:31.241,I fear he will form a crust if not sent to water.
00:32:31.241,00:32:34.369,No we shall see him well prepared before the guests arrive.
00:32:34.369,00:32:37.247,"Naevia, escort Numerius to the bath."
00:32:37.247,00:32:39.082,"Yes, Domina."
00:32:46.256,00:32:48.550,There is yet much the boy in him.
00:32:48.550,00:32:51.094,For but a moment longer.
00:32:51.094,00:32:53.346,Tonight Numerius becomes a man.
00:33:05.609,00:33:08.445,Clean?
00:33:08.445,00:33:11.156,Or do you yet require a hard scrubbing...
00:33:11.156,00:33:13.951,"No, I am..."
00:33:13.951,00:33:15.869,I am...
00:33:15.869,00:33:19.957,"Yes, you are."
00:33:19.957,00:33:22.501,Nothing more sensual than a warm bath.
00:33:31.426,00:33:34.346,Your eyes seem rather... fixed.
00:33:34.346,00:33:36.389,Apologies.
00:33:36.389,00:33:37.808,None required.
00:33:37.808,00:33:41.019,"This is your night, Numerius."
00:33:41.019,00:33:43.522,One that occurs but once in a man's lifetime.
00:33:44.564,00:33:46.483,I am filled with much excitement.
00:33:46.483,00:33:48.318,Of course you are.
00:33:48.318,00:33:51.655,Your life unfolds before you.
00:33:51.655,00:33:53.156,Many glories.
00:33:53.156,00:33:55.534,Many honors.
00:33:55.534,00:33:59.120,Many pleasures...
00:33:59.120,00:34:05.460,"The choices you make tonight will ripple through time, altering fates and destinies."
00:34:07.379,00:34:09.506,So much rests in your hands.
00:34:11.257,00:34:13.593,And I would see them properly filled...
00:35:07.355,00:35:09.566,Then he'd jump up and stab him down like that..
00:35:09.566,00:35:10.776,Yeah!
00:35:10.776,00:35:13.486,"He'd block that back-- A fine celebration, Batiatus!"
00:35:13.486,00:35:16.740,I've never seen the boy so happy.
00:35:16.740,00:35:19.576,Let us call him boy no longer.
00:35:19.576,00:35:21.453,"Uh, does he not appear to you a man?"
00:35:25.040,00:35:27.751,"He does seem to stand taller, does he not?"
00:35:27.751,00:35:29.461,By quite some measure.
00:35:29.461,00:35:32.965,Soon he will rival the stature of his honored father.
00:35:32.965,00:35:38.011,"It gives great pride, to know I have such an heir to carry the name Calavius."
00:35:38.011,00:35:40.138,Every house should be so blessed.
00:35:40.138,00:35:43.558,I believe your son will do extraordinary things.
00:35:43.558,00:35:46.561,I for one cannot wait to see them.
00:35:46.561,00:35:48.647,"Give me a go, come on.."
00:35:57.489,00:36:01.367,It appears the wife of the Legatus yet harbors grudge.
00:36:01.367,00:36:05.122,She is a cat absent claws.
00:36:05.122,00:36:06.748,Yet fangs remain.
00:36:12.671,00:36:15.715,The man overstepped.
00:36:15.715,00:36:18.551,I merely made correction.
00:36:18.551,00:36:21.847,"Still, the heart swells at such kindness."
00:36:21.847,00:36:23.723,Then see it deflate.
00:36:23.723,00:36:27.519,I would have done the same for any woman.
00:36:27.519,00:36:29.312,You are an ass.
00:36:33.608,00:36:35.360,"Uh, the Champion of Capua."
00:36:35.360,00:36:36.653,Always making friends.
00:36:36.653,00:36:39.280,I need but one.
00:36:39.280,00:36:40.490,Fortunate.
00:36:40.490,00:36:42.325,Since it appears one is all you have.
00:36:49.332,00:36:51.751,Her husband is mad with worry!
00:36:51.751,00:36:53.670,Licinia has completely vanished!
00:36:57.632,00:37:00.552,A proper woman should never travel without escort.
00:37:00.552,00:37:04.639,Her cousin good Crassus has offered substantial reward for her discovery.
00:37:04.639,00:37:07.350,Larger still towards punishment if harms been done.
00:37:07.350,00:37:10.645,But who would wish such a thing upon a relation of Crassus?
00:37:10.645,00:37:13.690,Why that would be madness.
00:37:16.442,00:37:17.652,Or pulled.
00:37:20.363,00:37:25.869,"Well, there can only be one cause to slip out in the night, absent slaves or husbands."
00:37:25.869,00:37:28.121,Oh!
00:37:28.121,00:37:32.333,"She is married to a fat little man, who sprouts hair as if beast."
00:37:34.211,00:37:36.046,Who could blame her?
00:37:36.046,00:37:40.133,"Flown to the arms of another, as Helen to Paris!"
00:37:40.133,00:37:41.593,Ha!
00:37:41.593,00:37:44.303,I fear Rome must be absent her beauty..
00:37:44.303,00:37:49.684,for tonight the jewels of the Republic stand glittering before me in Capua.
00:37:49.684,00:37:51.895,Good Solonius.
00:37:51.895,00:37:53.354,You decided to attend.
00:37:53.354,00:37:55.815,Who could resist such divine company?
00:37:55.815,00:37:58.401,Do my eyes deceive!
00:37:58.401,00:38:00.612,"Solonius, come from the shadow to the light?"
00:38:00.612,00:38:01.654,Embrace me as brother!
00:38:01.654,00:38:03.615,Would that blood were our bond.
00:38:05.658,00:38:08.912,"I almost did not recognize you, so gaunt of cheek."
00:38:08.912,00:38:10.622,Are you quite well?
00:38:10.622,00:38:12.290,My health has never been better.
00:38:12.290,00:38:15.668,"Sadly the same can't be said for your fortunes in the arena, huh?"
00:38:15.668,00:38:17.629,Have you had opportunity to greet the Magistrate?
00:38:17.629,00:38:20.423,He was deep in conference with the Consularis when I arrived.
00:38:20.423,00:38:25.470,"As the evening wears, I am certain he will find time for the less significant guests."
00:38:25.470,00:38:26.721,Gratitude for the invitation.
00:38:26.721,00:38:28.765,I hope soon to return the favor.
00:38:31.601,00:38:34.437,Did you see the look upon his face?
00:38:34.437,00:38:38.150,"He's the rictus of a man dying, a slice at a time."
00:38:38.150,00:38:40.777,I would have the fatal cut in a single stroke.
00:38:40.777,00:38:43.280,"Oh, I prefer as many strokes as possible."
00:38:43.280,00:38:44.697,To maximize the pleasure.
00:38:55.875,00:38:59.671,I was unaware you had taste for such exotic treats.
00:39:01.631,00:39:04.509,We cannot be seen together.
00:39:04.509,00:39:07.762,I find it curious that Batiatus would extend me invitation.
00:39:07.762,00:39:09.472,What is he planning?
00:39:11.641,00:39:15.770,To humiliate you before the Magistrate.
00:39:15.770,00:39:17.981,Your master swims in deep waters.
00:39:17.981,00:39:20.775,Some day soon he shall disappear beneath the waves.
00:39:23.695,00:39:27.490,"Come! Gather, esteemed guests!"
00:39:27.490,00:39:29.784,And those of questionable repute.
00:39:31.536,00:39:37.917,Tonight the House of Batiatus is humbled to help celebrate a most glorious occasion.
00:39:37.917,00:39:45.800,"The son of Magistrate Calavius, casts off the robes of a boy and becomes a proper Roman man!"
00:39:51.556,00:39:59.981,"Yet before he dons the Toga Virilis, let us honor him with sport and blood!"
00:39:59.981,00:40:03.360,A contest between the present and the past.
00:40:03.360,00:40:07.697,"Spartacus, Champion of Capua!"
00:40:13.078,00:40:14.495,And Crixus!
00:40:14.495,00:40:17.957,"Former Champion, step-- Wait."
00:40:17.957,00:40:20.752,I fear Crixus has seen his best day past.
00:40:23.338,00:40:25.882,I would have Varro fight in his place.
00:40:32.471,00:40:34.307,"You are the editor, young master!"
00:40:34.307,00:40:38.477,"Your will, our hands!"
00:40:38.477,00:40:39.938,Varro! Step forward!
00:40:48.071,00:40:50.156,The boy's change comes as surprise.
00:40:53.910,00:40:55.995,It seems the gods favor us both now.
00:40:58.331,00:41:00.458,Honor the boy.
00:41:00.458,00:41:01.960,Honor the ludus.
00:41:06.881,00:41:09.092,Let it pass.
00:41:09.092,00:41:12.678,The Magistrate's happiness is our only concern.
00:41:12.678,00:41:15.848,Come Numerius!
00:41:12.678,00:41:17.142,"These men, these titans of the arena, await your command!"
00:41:17.142,00:41:19.018,Let us give them a show.
00:41:20.478,00:41:21.813,Begin!
00:41:28.778,00:41:30.238,Oh!
00:42:27.837,00:42:30.215,My fucking flank!
00:42:30.215,00:42:33.843,"Protect it, and next time it may be you who stands victorious."
00:42:37.972,00:42:41.100,"Spartacus, still the Champion of Capua!"
00:42:41.100,00:42:46.189,"And Varro, formidable opponent, one to watch closely in the arena!"
00:42:46.189,00:42:47.524,Come Numerius!
00:42:47.524,00:42:49.650,Pass judgment on our fallen warrior!
00:43:13.007,00:43:16.594,"Apologies, Magistrate, it was agreed this was an exhibition only."
00:43:16.594,00:43:19.764,Not a fight to the death.
00:43:22.934,00:43:25.770,Numerius has made his decision.
00:43:25.770,00:43:28.147,I will reimburse you the cost of the man.
00:43:39.033,00:43:40.785,Proceed.
00:44:04.642,00:44:06.311,I said proceed.
00:44:23.995,00:44:25.121,Don't...
00:44:29.917,00:44:33.004,Don't.
00:44:33.004,00:44:37.091,They will kill us both.
00:44:37.091,00:44:40.970,There is no choice.
00:44:40.970,00:44:42.305,There is always a choice.
00:44:45.099,00:44:47.352,Not this time.
00:44:52.815,00:44:54.484,Spartacus!
00:45:12.168,00:45:14.379,Live...
00:45:14.379,00:45:18.383,And see my family provided for.
00:45:20.176,00:45:22.512,I would have done the same...
00:46:39.046,00:46:43.050,"I am forever indebted to your hospitality, Batiatus."
00:46:43.050,00:46:44.009,Think nothing of it.
00:46:44.009,00:46:46.137,A favor for a dear friend.
00:46:46.137,00:46:48.055,He calls for blood without hesitation!
00:46:48.055,00:46:50.933,Such boldness will one day lead him to the senate.
00:46:52.977,00:46:54.979,The noblest of ambitions.
00:46:54.979,00:46:58.232,I myself have designs towards political office.
00:46:58.232,00:46:59.400,Is that so?
00:46:59.400,00:47:04.238,"Well, not the senate, not so soon, but something local."
00:47:04.238,00:47:06.449,I leave for the coast on business.
00:47:06.449,00:47:08.242,"Well, when you return then."
00:47:10.077,00:47:13.414,Politics is too dull for a man of your persuasion!
00:47:13.414,00:47:16.459,You would ache for the sights and sounds of the arena.
00:47:16.459,00:47:21.005,A sacrifice I would gladly make in the service to Rome.
00:47:22.965,00:47:25.426,"Batiatus, you are a fine lanista."
00:47:25.426,00:47:27.970,Perhaps the finest in all the Republic.
00:47:27.970,00:47:29.430,But politics...
00:47:29.430,00:47:31.848,It requires a different sort.
00:47:31.848,00:47:36.020,"Citizens of status, with the proper heritage."
00:47:36.020,00:47:38.189,Just so.
00:47:38.189,00:47:40.107,Relish what you know best.
00:47:40.107,00:47:43.528,Leave politics to the men with breeding for it.
00:47:43.528,00:47:45.112,"Come, good Solonius!"
00:47:45.112,00:47:47.906,We have not had occasion to speak this evening.
00:47:51.536,00:47:54.497,The Magistrate's response?
00:47:54.497,00:47:56.915,To be answered in blood.
00:00:48.465,00:00:54.847,It is never an easy thing to see a friend once loved now absent breath.
00:00:58.684,00:01:00.268,He should yet walk.
00:01:02.229,00:01:07.442,"That foolish grin, and dreams of a life beyond these walls."
00:01:12.489,00:01:15.116,Every night breaks.
00:01:15.242,00:01:17.202,And we must all wake.
00:01:26.545,00:01:30.298,I would the gods turn back the sun...
00:01:30.424,00:01:31.884,and set me in his place.
00:01:33.010,00:01:34.344,He fought with honor.
00:01:34.469,00:01:37.056,As did you both.
00:01:37.180,00:01:40.517,His heart was stilled for a boy's amusement.
00:01:42.561,00:01:44.563,Where is the honor in that?
00:01:48.191,00:01:51.194,Varro left this world a gladiator.
00:01:51.319,00:01:52.905,And shall be remembered as such.
00:01:53.864,00:01:55.407,No.
00:01:57.200,00:02:00.829,He will be remembered as a husband.
00:02:04.249,00:02:06.543,A father.
00:02:09.421,00:02:11.423,And a friend amongst enemies.
00:03:01.348,00:03:02.850,Aurelia...
00:03:05.727,00:03:07.646,Is it true?
00:03:17.322,00:03:19.616,He loved you as a brother.
00:03:33.463,00:03:36.175,He's not going to take this loss well.
00:03:36.299,00:03:38.010,And who can fucking blame him?
00:03:44.265,00:03:51.190,"Calavius slaughters my stock at the whim of his maggot, shits upon my ambitions, mocking me in my own house."
00:03:51.314,00:03:55.360,"No, not a loss to be taken fucking well."
00:03:55.485,00:03:58.321,But one that will be answered in kind.
00:03:58.446,00:03:59.740,Out.
00:04:00.782,00:04:03.451,He is a Magistrate.
00:04:04.578,00:04:05.495,He is but a man.
00:04:05.620,00:04:08.123,"And all men fall, beneath the heel of their hubris."
00:04:08.248,00:04:09.750,Quintus..
00:04:09.875,00:04:11.334,Turn thoughts toward other matters.
00:04:15.589,00:04:16.506,She has departed for Rome to meet Glaber.
00:04:16.631,00:04:18.050,Welcome news.
00:04:18.175,00:04:22.137,The support of a Legatus should be more than enough to gain political office.
00:04:22.262,00:04:29.352,I only regret Calavius will not live to see the unworthy name of Batiatus so elevated.
00:04:29.477,00:04:31.438,The very thought of discovery...
00:04:31.563,00:04:33.523,It turns the stomach.
00:04:33.648,00:04:35.609,"Make it a thing of iron, and see it settled."
00:04:38.195,00:04:39.738,What news?
00:04:42.574,00:04:46.161,"Speak, caress my ear with words."
00:04:46.286,00:04:49.039,You will find them soft and pleasing.
00:04:49.164,00:04:53.168,We set upon the Magistrate on the road leaving the city.
00:04:53.293,00:04:54.086,The guards and wagon?
00:04:54.211,00:04:55.754,Attended to as instructed.
00:04:55.879,00:04:59.258,The man himself removed to the appointed place.
00:04:59.382,00:05:00.217,Ashur?
00:05:00.341,00:05:01.468,Standing watch.
00:05:01.593,00:05:04.221,I will relieve him by cover of night.
00:05:04.345,00:05:06.265,I shall accompany.
00:05:06.389,00:05:10.602,"I would gaze into the man's eyes, and see the power of my reflection in them."
00:05:10.727,00:05:11.812,"Until such time, avail yourself of my hospitality."
00:05:11.937,00:05:12.771,"Wine, women..."
00:05:12.896,00:05:13.814,Both would suit me.
00:05:13.939,00:05:15.649,And so deserved.
00:05:15.774,00:05:17.109,Dominus.
00:05:21.196,00:05:22.489,"It's done, then?"
00:05:22.614,00:05:23.824,No.
00:05:24.908,00:05:26.534,It's only just begun.
00:05:48.765,00:05:52.769,"Behold, the glorious Champion of Capua."
00:05:54.353,00:05:57.232,A heavy heart weighs a man's sword.
00:05:57.356,00:06:01.611,The loss of a brother is heartfelt by every gladiator.
00:06:01.736,00:06:06.283,"We honor him not with tears, but with blood spilled in the arena."
00:06:06.407,00:06:08.160,Spoken as a true champion.
00:06:10.120,00:06:12.455,The games against Pompeii approach.
00:06:12.580,00:06:17.627,Years I have been robbed of the primus by Solonius and his bribes.
00:06:17.752,00:06:21.589,"Finally it is secured by our Dominus, and who fights?"
00:06:22.632,00:06:24.467,Spartacus.
00:06:24.592,00:06:26.845,The woman who grieves.
00:06:31.558,00:06:32.851,Spartacus.
00:06:33.894,00:06:35.520,You are summoned.
00:06:50.535,00:06:53.580,Is this truly my likeness?
00:06:53.705,00:06:58.377,"Have so many years passed, that marble must be etched with such lines?"
00:06:58.501,00:07:02.797,Would that every man lived to see his face so marred.
00:07:02.923,00:07:05.092,And the wretched pass smooth of skin.
00:07:11.265,00:07:15.269,It seizes the breast to lose a gladiator of such standing.
00:07:15.394,00:07:19.940,"The comparison is false, to a son losing his father."
00:07:20.065,00:07:21.649,"A wife, her husband."
00:07:21.775,00:07:22.817,"A burden, to be sure."
00:07:22.943,00:07:24.986,Yet he was aware of risk and took them of his free will.
00:07:25.112,00:07:26.821,As a gladiator.
00:07:28.740,00:07:30.200,Not a child's plaything.
00:07:32.702,00:07:36.331,The Magistrate and his whelp have caused us both pain.
00:07:36.456,00:07:38.750,"It will not go unanswered, I promise you."
00:07:47.384,00:07:50.178,I would have your focus turned towards the games of Pompeii.
00:07:51.763,00:08:01.148,"That perfumed shit Solonius always secured the Primus by inserting tongue in ass, only to be crushed by our city's hated rival."
00:08:02.399,00:08:04.943,But this year he falls out of favor.
00:08:05.068,00:08:08.738,This year the House of Batiatus secures the honor!
00:08:08.863,00:08:15.703,"Spartacus, Bringer of Rain, to face Pericles, Titan of Pompeii!"
00:08:17.872,00:08:19.874,"No quarter given, no mercy shown."
00:08:20.000,00:08:21.960,And the purse?
00:08:25.297,00:08:26.965,I would see it paid to Varro's wife.
00:08:29.634,00:08:30.718,A substantial sum.
00:08:30.844,00:08:32.553,You would see it all past from your fingers?
00:08:32.679,00:08:35.140,Along with future winnings that I claim in the arena.
00:08:38.477,00:08:39.853,A noble gesture.
00:08:44.691,00:08:45.984,You would do this?
00:08:47.694,00:08:49.363,For Varro?
00:08:49.488,00:08:50.530,"I would do it for you, Spartacus."
00:08:50.655,00:08:53.825,"That you have peace of mind, knowing his family is attended to."
00:08:58.872,00:09:01.958,These sad events have obviously taken their toll.
00:09:02.083,00:09:10.133,"Rest, and be reassured that those responsible for our pain will soon drink deep of their own."
00:09:23.563,00:09:27.317,I saw in your eyes how you craved to defy order of his death.
00:09:29.652,00:09:30.945,A shame you did not attempt it.
00:10:03.728,00:10:04.938,Goat-fuck!
00:10:05.063,00:10:06.773,I knew it!
00:10:07.982,00:10:09.859,Why do you fucking bleat?
00:10:09.984,00:10:10.735,"You fight by my side, brother!"
00:10:10.860,00:10:11.861,Like a suckling babe.
00:10:11.986,00:10:13.947,I would prove myself alone.
00:10:16.741,00:10:18.785,And die the same.
00:10:24.916,00:10:27.127,Our Champion does not look to form.
00:10:27.252,00:10:29.129,"Hm, the gods punish him."
00:10:30.838,00:10:31.798,For what offense?
00:10:32.966,00:10:35.469,"Varro's blood, still wet upon his hands?"
00:10:35.594,00:10:37.471,His hands were removed from choice.
00:10:37.596,00:10:40.390,I would die before I would kill my own brother..
00:10:40.515,00:10:42.267,And who would see to your brother's family?
00:10:49.983,00:10:51.401,"What answer do you give, Duro?"
00:10:54.070,00:10:57.824,"With both of you dead, who would see to his wife?!"
00:10:57.949,00:10:59.326,His child?!
00:10:59.451,00:11:01.035,My brother has no wife or child.
00:11:05.624,00:11:06.916,Wait!
00:11:07.041,00:11:09.127,Fucking Thracians.
00:11:38.906,00:11:40.659,Apologies.
00:11:40.783,00:11:42.661,I called your name...
00:11:42.785,00:11:44.120,I did not hear.
00:11:45.079,00:11:47.706,You do not appear yourself.
00:11:47.832,00:11:49.834,Did Dominus send you?
00:11:49.959,00:11:52.671,He would see your spirits raised.
00:11:54.673,00:11:56.216,Spartacus..
00:11:56.341,00:11:57.925,Your wound...
00:12:00.845,00:12:02.347,Varro suffered worse.
00:12:03.806,00:12:04.683,I will help you to your cell.
00:12:04.807,00:12:06.142,You are not needed.
00:12:10.897,00:12:12.190,Apologies.
00:12:13.650,00:12:15.360,Mira.
00:12:20.240,00:12:22.867,The man I saw you with...
00:12:22.992,00:12:25.579,I was ordered to tend to his needs.
00:12:25.704,00:12:27.205,He means nothing to me.
00:12:28.747,00:12:30.166,Such is not my concern.
00:13:00.530,00:13:01.822,Batiatus...
00:13:01.948,00:13:03.491,"Apologies for the accommodation, Magistrate."
00:13:03.617,00:13:07.287,Take comfort knowing that you will not have to endure for long.
00:13:07.412,00:13:08.747,What is this madness?
00:13:08.871,00:13:10.498,Madness?
00:13:10.624,00:13:11.499,No.
00:13:11.625,00:13:16.129,"It's only reason, born of a clear mind and wounded heart."
00:13:17.171,00:13:18.298,Wounded?
00:13:18.423,00:13:20.925,I have done you no injury.
00:13:21.050,00:13:23.844,The man's crimes escape his lofty notice.
00:13:24.971,00:13:27.056,Release me!
00:13:27.181,00:13:29.016,"Oh, I intend to."
00:13:29.142,00:13:31.852,From this fucking world.
00:13:34.939,00:13:40.737,"Whatever your disagreement, let us discuss it as civilized men."
00:13:40.861,00:13:42.029,"No, you mistake me."
00:13:42.155,00:13:43.990,I am but a base animal.
00:13:44.115,00:13:46.867,A beast to be ridden and disregarded.
00:13:48.328,00:13:50.997,You accept my hospitality.
00:13:51.122,00:13:52.332,Enter my home.
00:13:52.457,00:13:55.168,"Break bread, drink my wine."
00:13:55.293,00:13:59.046,Only to spit in my face.
00:14:07.930,00:14:11.685,Offense was not my intent.
00:14:11.810,00:14:15.980,I sought only to spare you further humiliation...
00:14:16.105,00:14:17.856,Spare me?!
00:14:17.982,00:14:21.277,"You don't have power to spare shit, you pathetic cunt!"
00:14:22.945,00:14:24.405,Uh!
00:14:25.365,00:14:27.617,Now speak the words!
00:14:27.742,00:14:29.619,Tell me my heritage!
00:14:29.744,00:14:33.122,Tell me my family name bears no weight among you and your noble cock eaters!
00:14:33.247,00:14:34.749,Huh?
00:14:34.874,00:14:38.085,- Speak!
00:14:38.211,00:14:40.463,Perhaps if you move your foot...
00:14:47.470,00:14:49.055,Lift him up.
00:14:49.180,00:14:50.640,Dominus.
00:15:00.191,00:15:02.026,You wish words from me?
00:15:04.070,00:15:06.698,May you listen to them well.
00:15:06.823,00:15:08.199,You are a jest.
00:15:09.492,00:15:15.373,"A man tolerated, because of his ownership of Spartacus, the savior of Capua."
00:15:17.208,00:15:21.921,"When he falls, you will quickly follow."
00:15:22.046,00:15:26.300,"Tied to a fucking chair in the filth and mire, and yet the man provokes!"
00:15:29.512,00:15:32.640,"You still do not see it, do you, good Batiatus?"
00:15:34.392,00:15:37.228,You are beneath me.
00:15:42.066,00:15:45.111,Do what you must to balm your wounded pride.
00:15:45.236,00:15:47.697,I will not beg.
00:15:49.198,00:15:50.867,Beg?
00:15:50.991,00:15:53.411,"No, the time for begging is long past."
00:15:55.288,00:15:58.165,Plans have been set in motion.
00:15:58.291,00:16:02.253,For you...
00:16:03.797,00:16:05.298,What does my boy to do with it?
00:16:05.423,00:16:07.049,He is a man now.
00:16:07.174,00:16:09.510,He too has a part to play in our little drama.
00:16:12.221,00:16:15.349,"Batiatus, you.."
00:16:19.228,00:16:20.980,Attend he does not injure himself.
00:16:21.105,00:16:24.317,I would see him fresh for the appointed time.
00:16:28.112,00:16:29.155,Perhaps if we err..
00:16:29.280,00:16:31.115,Argh!
00:16:31.240,00:16:35.119,"Take hold of your cock and follow the plan, uh."
00:16:38.247,00:16:41.167,"We are committed, we are committed."
00:16:41.292,00:16:42.669,Dominus.
00:16:51.260,00:16:52.804,The games approach!
00:16:52.929,00:16:57.224,"Prove yourselves against Pompeii, and honor the House of Batiatus!"
00:17:07.193,00:17:09.111,My brother meant nothing by his remarks.
00:17:10.446,00:17:11.656,Thoughts shared by many.
00:17:13.741,00:17:15.409,You wish to rest?
00:17:17.161,00:17:19.330,"If I do, I shall tell you."
00:17:26.004,00:17:27.505,Did I hurt you...
00:17:28.214,00:17:29.674,Champion?
00:17:45.899,00:17:47.441,Tend to the wound.
00:17:47.567,00:17:49.360,Spartacus!
00:17:53.364,00:17:54.699,Spartacus...
00:18:14.427,00:18:16.387,The man is half dead!
00:18:16.512,00:18:18.264,You didn't notice he needed fucking attention?!
00:18:18.389,00:18:20.266,I thought him only distracted by Varro's death.
00:18:20.391,00:18:22.101,Will he be able to fight against Pompeii?
00:18:22.226,00:18:23.269,He burns with fever.
00:18:23.394,00:18:25.521,A miracle if he lives to the games.
00:18:26.731,00:18:28.190,Provide a list of all that is needed.
00:18:28.315,00:18:29.400,"Ashur heads to market, he will see it filled."
00:18:29.525,00:18:31.193,Let not a moment pass with him unattended.
00:18:31.318,00:18:35.114,Fetch Mira from the Villa if you need assistance.
00:18:35.239,00:18:36.991,He has some feelings towards the girl.
00:18:39.577,00:18:42.246,Our champion cannot fall.
00:18:42.371,00:18:43.790,Dominus.
00:18:49.087,00:18:53.716,The Primus against Pompeii finally mine and the gods jam cock in ass!
00:18:53.841,00:18:57.053,The crowd will turn upon me when they learn Spartacus does not fight!
00:18:57.177,00:18:59.221,Perhaps they will be appeased with suitable replacement.
00:18:59.346,00:19:01.557,Who but Spartacus could best their fucking champion?
00:19:01.682,00:19:02.850,There is but one...
00:19:04.560,00:19:06.104,The primus?
00:19:06.228,00:19:07.229,Mine!
00:19:07.354,00:19:11.191,At last Batiatus remembers my worth and I shall take the sand again.
00:19:11.317,00:19:15.154,And see it turn red with the blood of Pericles!
00:19:15.279,00:19:16.530,Soften your words.
00:19:16.656,00:19:17.824,We will be discovered.
00:19:17.949,00:19:19.325,Will let them hear us.
00:19:19.450,00:19:21.535,"Tonight, I am a god!"
00:19:24.246,00:19:27.458,"And I will reclaim my title, Champion of Capua..."
00:19:30.962,00:19:33.464,The news does not please you.
00:19:33.589,00:19:35.675,"It fills my heart with joy, to see you so alive."
00:19:38.302,00:19:40.179,And would have you remain so.
00:19:40.304,00:19:42.431,Naevia...
00:19:42.556,00:19:44.767,"The Primus is a fight to the death, Crixus."
00:19:46.769,00:19:49.313,You have been absent the arena many months.
00:19:50.148,00:19:51.107,If Pericles were...
00:19:52.232,00:19:53.359,He will not.
00:19:53.484,00:19:55.361,How can you be certain?
00:19:57.363,00:20:00.074,Because I will never leave your side.
00:20:00.199,00:20:03.494,Death itself will tremble if it tries to part us.
00:20:05.287,00:20:12.670,"Tomorrow when I take victory, I will look to you in the pulvinus."
00:20:12.795,00:20:15.673,We will share the moment alone.
00:20:38.529,00:20:40.489,Your hand is weighted.
00:20:40.614,00:20:41.991,Now float your tongue.
00:20:44.618,00:20:46.245,You are safe.
00:20:46.370,00:20:49.582,My master has greater concerns requiring his attentions.
00:20:49.707,00:20:52.752,What plagues good Batiatus to such distraction?
00:20:52.877,00:20:54.628,Matters beyond your worries.
00:20:56.047,00:20:58.216,Yet they clearly trouble you.
00:20:58.340,00:21:00.593,"Confide, lift your burden."
00:21:03.345,00:21:06.515,His thirst for power and vengeance clouds judgment.
00:21:06.640,00:21:09.476,How so?
00:21:09.602,00:21:12.312,I have taken too great a risk meeting with you this night.
00:21:13.397,00:21:16.358,"I must to the apothecary, before I am overdue."
00:21:16.483,00:21:21.155,"One day, very soon, the House of Batiatus will come crashing down."
00:21:21.280,00:21:23.699,Do not find yourself buried in the rubble.
00:21:37.880,00:21:39.590,Fucking hold him down!
00:21:51.269,00:21:54.147,That's right.
00:21:54.272,00:21:56.732,Easy.
00:22:05.574,00:22:08.077,"Well, lick my hole."
00:22:08.202,00:22:10.454,The pig-fucker's still alive.
00:22:39.357,00:22:41.068,This is what you are to him.
00:22:42.402,00:22:45.572,"Gold, mined from blood and meat."
00:23:08.679,00:23:11.682,All hail Spartacus.
00:23:17.938,00:23:20.024,Slayer of the Shadow.
00:23:24.695,00:23:26.989,Bringer of the Rain.
00:23:29.867,00:23:32.703,Champion of the Romans...
00:24:47.987,00:24:49.655,Fuck!
00:24:53.242,00:24:56.370,Is that the best the great Pompeii has to offer?
00:24:56.494,00:24:58.747,I fear the games will be a disappointment this year.
00:25:00.582,00:25:02.460,These early skirmishes count for nothing.
00:25:02.584,00:25:03.752,It is the Primus that decides the victor.
00:25:03.877,00:25:04.837,Um hum.
00:25:04.962,00:25:10.468,"Absent your man Spartacus, Capua shall once again find itself in Pompeii's shadow."
00:25:10.592,00:25:12.845,Perhaps Crixus will bring light to the matter.
00:25:12.970,00:25:15.431,"Crixus, yes."
00:25:15.555,00:25:17.266,The crowd will be amazed...
00:25:17.391,00:25:19.810,that the Gaul is still alive.
00:25:19.935,00:25:22.271,Batiatus assures us he's recovered from his injuries.
00:25:23.439,00:25:25.691,That he survived at all is impressive.
00:25:25.816,00:25:28.568,No gladiator from Pompeii ever lived against Theokoles.
00:25:28.694,00:25:31.447,Young Numerius cuts to the truth.
00:25:31.571,00:25:34.116,A talent he learned from his father.
00:25:34.241,00:25:37.744,Does good Calavius intend to grace us with his presence?
00:25:37.870,00:25:39.663,The day grows short.
00:25:39.788,00:25:42.458,Critical matters of trade in Picentia.
00:25:42.582,00:25:44.377,He must have been delayed upon his return.
00:25:44.502,00:25:46.920,I am certain he will join us presently.
00:26:09.402,00:26:11.320,Aulus!
00:26:11.445,00:26:13.947,"Up, you fucking goat!"
00:26:14.073,00:26:17.410,Dominus does not pay you to dream of tits and cunts.
00:26:17.535,00:26:20.371,"Place foot on me again, and find yourself once more a cripple."
00:26:20.496,00:26:22.540,You know the stakes we deal.
00:26:22.664,00:26:24.083,If Calavius were to escape...
00:26:24.208,00:26:26.377,Fuck your mouth shut.
00:26:26.502,00:26:28.087,The man has not stirred.
00:26:35.802,00:26:38.097,Nor does he breathe!
00:26:41.392,00:26:46.397,Batiatus commanded he not expire until the appointed hour!
00:26:46.522,00:26:49.525,"He's still alive, you fucking woman."
00:26:49.649,00:26:51.026,"Raise yourself, peacock!"
00:26:55.531,00:26:57.157,Shit...
00:26:57.283,00:26:58.700,This is on you.
00:26:58.825,00:26:59.577,I will share no...
00:26:59.701,00:27:00.994,Quiet!
00:27:02.913,00:27:05.707,He breathes.
00:27:05.832,00:27:07.084,The man is still alive.
00:27:09.086,00:27:10.879,Aulus!
00:27:13.966,00:27:15.968,I will have you both crucified!
00:27:16.093,00:27:17.428,And your master..
00:27:19.721,00:27:21.014,"Aulus, enough!"
00:27:22.600,00:27:23.976,Aulus!
00:27:24.684,00:27:25.727,Let me see.
00:27:25.852,00:27:27.771,Let me see.
00:27:30.899,00:27:34.445,"Ugly as a whore's gash, but you will live."
00:27:34.570,00:27:38.157,Return to the ludus and have Medicus attend to it.
00:27:38.282,00:27:40.784,Do you have the balls to see this through alone?
00:27:41.619,00:27:42.536,Two of them.
00:27:44.079,00:27:45.289,Go.
00:28:10.272,00:28:12.149,Why don't I begin our Primus?
00:28:22.493,00:28:24.453,The crowd threatens riot.
00:28:28.081,00:28:29.791,Good Batiatus.
00:28:29.916,00:28:32.628,Would you present the Primus on my husband's behalf?
00:28:32.752,00:28:34.463,"Well, if you think it proper..."
00:28:34.588,00:28:36.048,Please.
00:28:36.173,00:28:37.174,Boo!
00:28:37.299,00:28:38.634,Where's the fucking Magistrate!
00:28:38.758,00:28:40.886,We want some action!
00:28:49.978,00:29:01.740,"In honor of Magistrate Calavius, who is absent attending vital business on your behalf, I present the Primus against Pompeii!"
00:29:01.865,00:29:03.659,Spartacus!
00:29:06.620,00:29:08.706,Spartacus!
00:29:08.830,00:29:10.290,Yes!
00:29:10.416,00:29:15.087,"Yes, we all desire to see Spartacus, take to the sands!"
00:29:24.638,00:29:27.140,Yet there is cause to rejoice!
00:29:28.475,00:29:34.106,"This is a glorious moment, much anticipated!"
00:29:42.072,00:29:43.449,Crixus!
00:30:02.301,00:30:06.263,Then it is time you reminded them who their true champion is.
00:30:25.491,00:30:28.452,It appears Capua does not care for your selection.
00:30:30.912,00:30:38.878,"He faces a most vile opponent, belched from the bowels of Pompeii."
00:30:40.172,00:30:41.173,Hum!
00:30:41.298,00:30:43.967,I give you Pericles!
00:30:57.690,00:31:00.150,Pericles!
00:31:11.787,00:31:13.580,I pray the match is overly brief!
00:31:13.706,00:31:15.165,Hm!
00:31:20.045,00:31:22.922,I would see his fat smirk removed.
00:31:23.048,00:31:24.216,Give the command.
00:31:28.094,00:31:30.138,Begin!
00:32:26.027,00:32:27.320,Oh!
00:32:29.114,00:32:31.283,What was the fucking cause?
00:32:31.408,00:32:34.244,"A dog, soon to be put down."
00:32:40.542,00:32:42.419,Smells like piss.
00:32:42.544,00:32:43.336,Henbane.
00:32:54.264,00:32:56.391,Come for me if his condition changes.
00:33:23.502,00:33:25.378,Pomleii!
00:33:29.215,00:33:34.053,"Another year, another favored son of Capua gone to grass."
00:33:34.179,00:33:36.097,The match is not yet concluded.
00:33:36.222,00:33:37.474,Formalities of blood.
00:33:37.599,00:33:39.184,Your man is finished.
00:33:39.309,00:33:42.395,Crixus has the heart of a lion.
00:33:49.235,00:33:50.445,Look!
00:33:52.197,00:33:53.114,Oh!
00:33:53.239,00:33:55.033,Lucretia!
00:33:55.158,00:33:56.284,Domina.
00:33:56.409,00:33:57.243,Give her water.
00:33:57.369,00:34:01.581,Your wife does not fare well at the sight of your man about to be slaughtered.
00:34:04.334,00:34:06.169,Apologies.
00:34:06.294,00:34:08.171,Its the heat...
00:34:08.296,00:34:10.007,See her back to the villa.
00:34:10.131,00:34:11.090,It will pass.
00:34:11.216,00:34:12.885,No arguments.
00:34:13.010,00:34:15.261,I will join you afterwards.
00:34:15.387,00:34:16.555,Dominus.
00:34:28.233,00:34:31.570,Crixus!
00:35:51.441,00:35:53.068,Kill!
00:35:53.192,00:35:54.402,Kill!
00:36:24.432,00:36:26.351,Crixus!
00:36:26.476,00:36:28.561,Crixus!
00:36:33.066,00:36:34.359,Crixus!
00:36:34.484,00:36:38.321,Returned to form as promised!
00:36:38.446,00:36:40.281,Your prayers have been answered.
00:36:40.406,00:36:42.283,The match was overly brief.
00:36:45.328,00:36:49.248,"Good fortune to Capua, and all its deserving citizens."
00:36:49.374,00:36:52.085,"Oh, linger a moment!"
00:36:52.210,00:36:56.255,Let us have a drink and relive this glorious day...
00:36:56.381,00:36:57.590,Dominus...
00:37:01.094,00:37:05.431,What news so important it interrupts the gloating of good Batiatus?
00:37:05.557,00:37:08.560,The Magistrate's caravan has been discovered on the edge of town.
00:37:08.685,00:37:10.436,His guards murdered.
00:37:11.563,00:37:12.939,What of my father?
00:37:13.065,00:37:17.402,"He was not among them, but there are tracks, - leading back to the city."
00:37:17.527,00:37:19.196,Why would anyone commit such treachery?
00:37:19.320,00:37:20.530,Ransom.
00:37:22.157,00:37:23.616,This burden saddens me.
00:37:23.742,00:37:25.577,If I may be of any assistance...
00:37:25.702,00:37:27.412,Gratitude.
00:37:27.537,00:37:29.539,We can handle it.
00:37:36.088,00:37:37.505,"Numerius, your presence is welcome."
00:37:37.630,00:37:38.715,No. I will have him by my side.
00:37:38.840,00:37:39.424,Mother.
00:37:39.549,00:37:42.802,I will never let him out of my sight.
00:37:44.012,00:37:44.930,Come.
00:37:45.055,00:37:46.639,Let us to your father.
00:38:02.155,00:38:04.616,"You send message, yet I wait as a common slave."
00:38:04.741,00:38:06.492,Apologies.
00:38:06.618,00:38:07.911,It was difficult to move without notice.
00:38:09.162,00:38:10.288,Speak quickly.
00:38:10.413,00:38:12.249,I join the search for good Calavius.
00:38:12.373,00:38:13.458,He's gone missing.
00:38:13.583,00:38:15.252,I am aware of his absence.
00:38:15.376,00:38:17.587,The very matter I wish to broach.
00:38:23.635,00:38:24.636,Calavius' ring!
00:38:24.761,00:38:25.595,Shhh!
00:38:25.720,00:38:27.472,Softly!
00:38:27.597,00:38:28.807,How did you come by this?
00:38:28.932,00:38:32.144,Through means pressing upon your desires.
00:38:32.269,00:38:35.021,"Batiatus holds him captive, with intent of murder."
00:38:36.898,00:38:39.442,"Madness, even for Batiatus."
00:38:39.567,00:38:42.237,"Magistrate Calavius insults him, obstructs his ambitions."
00:38:42.361,00:38:44.823,I've never seen Batiatus so unhinged.
00:38:45.698,00:38:48.827,"I would sever bonds, least I find myself upon the cross beside him."
00:38:48.952,00:38:50.495,Calavius.
00:38:50.620,00:38:51.746,Yet lives?
00:38:51.871,00:38:53.665,For the briefest of moments.
00:38:53.790,00:38:56.334,Where is he held?
00:38:56.459,00:38:59.171,"Oh, you speak of severing bonds, but remain firmly tethered!"
00:38:59.296,00:39:03.424,"I hold no love for old loyalties, yet Calavius has seen my face!"
00:39:03.549,00:39:07.595,"I must flee this city, and would have proper means to do so."
00:39:07.720,00:39:09.848,Take it.
00:39:12.642,00:39:13.434,"Come, we must gather men."
00:39:13.559,00:39:15.561,Calavius would be dead before you do.
00:39:15.687,00:39:17.689,Batiatus already moves towards his plan.
00:39:18.564,00:39:20.441,Are you armed?
00:39:20.566,00:39:21.526,A simple dagger...
00:39:21.651,00:39:22.944,Enough to cut ropes.
00:39:23.820,00:39:24.821,Quickly!
00:39:24.946,00:39:26.698,Or see opportunity fade!
00:40:03.735,00:40:05.570,Medicus?
00:40:09.615,00:40:10.992,Mira?
00:41:23.731,00:41:25.942,Why did you kill him?
00:41:31.990,00:41:33.950,I had no choice.
00:41:37.203,00:41:39.622,A man must accept his fate...
00:41:50.633,00:41:51.926,Or be destroyed by it.
00:41:53.803,00:41:55.847,Is this my path?
00:41:55.972,00:41:58.475,Blood and death?
00:41:58.599,00:42:02.728,You have always been destined for unfortunate things...
00:42:14.949,00:42:16.826,Please...
00:42:17.702,00:42:19.496,Do not leave me again...
00:42:19.620,00:42:21.539,It was you...
00:42:21.664,00:42:23.875,"It was you, who left..."
00:42:29.047,00:42:31.674,You must tend to the wound.
00:42:57.867,00:42:59.952,Attacked...
00:43:01.871,00:43:04.040,on the road...
00:43:06.792,00:43:08.836,Came out of nowhere.
00:43:26.687,00:43:29.023,Tend to the wound.
00:43:39.784,00:43:42.703,I'm here.
00:43:43.829,00:43:45.748,Be still...
00:43:50.878,00:43:53.089,Your fevers broken.
00:43:54.507,00:43:56.092,The gods have blessed you...
00:44:01.889,00:44:04.100,Yes.
00:44:05.643,00:44:07.270,They have.
00:44:15.612,00:44:16.821,I will fetch Medicus.
00:44:16.946,00:44:18.114,Wait.
00:44:19.616,00:44:21.033,Release the straps.
00:44:22.619,00:44:24.162,"I would speak to this man, alone."
00:44:25.746,00:44:26.831,Towards what purpose?
00:44:26.956,00:44:27.999,Wait in the corridor.
00:44:28.124,00:44:30.126,Sound warning if anyone approaches.
00:44:35.298,00:44:36.966,"Do this for me, Mira."
00:44:40.303,00:44:42.138,I will be in your debt.
00:44:50.355,00:44:51.564,There is no sign of him.
00:44:51.688,00:44:53.107,My father could be held anywhere.
00:44:53.232,00:44:56.902,"He is a man of much esteem, and easily recognized."
00:44:57.028,00:44:59.322,How could he be moved through the streets without notice?
00:44:59.447,00:45:01.073,I do not know.
00:45:02.116,00:45:03.576,Think.
00:45:03.700,00:45:05.161,There must be a way...
00:45:10.333,00:45:12.627,The cisterns!
00:45:12.751,00:45:14.629,They run beneath the city and beyond!
00:45:14.753,00:45:15.754,The gates!
00:45:15.880,00:45:17.674,Torches!
00:45:17.798,00:45:19.008,"You will be with your father, Soon enough Numerius."
00:45:19.133,00:45:20.677,You have my word.
00:45:20.801,00:45:22.719,Your part in this shall not be forgotten.
00:45:22.845,00:45:25.181,"No, it shall not."
00:45:31.145,00:45:32.063,Calavius...
00:45:32.188,00:45:33.730,Wait.
00:45:33.856,00:45:34.607,They approach!
00:45:34.773,00:45:35.732,We must hurry.
00:45:35.858,00:45:37.109,"No, it is too late."
00:45:37.235,00:45:38.570,Steel your fucking nerve!
00:45:41.155,00:45:44.450,"Consider Ashur a spirit, and Capua the world he left behind!"
00:45:44.576,00:45:45.951,Ashur!
00:45:49.830,00:45:51.708,They are upon us!
00:45:51.832,00:45:53.042,We must get you free...
00:46:15.772,00:46:17.483,Solonius!
00:46:20.903,00:46:23.322,"No, no..."
00:46:30.288,00:46:32.248,Seize him!
00:46:37.169,00:46:39.422,Your father shall be avenged.
00:46:41.215,00:46:44.594,Solonius will suffer for what he has done.
00:46:51.643,00:46:55.271,And all of Capua will know you for the shit you are.
00:47:00.485,00:47:02.819,What are you doing?!
00:47:02.945,00:47:04.113,What are you doing?!
00:47:06.240,00:47:08.785,Tell me what happened.
00:47:08.909,00:47:10.286,Tell!
00:47:10.411,00:47:12.371,Take your hands off me.
00:47:12.497,00:47:13.998,My wife.
00:47:14.123,00:47:16.292,Sura.
00:47:16.417,00:47:19.128,The slave you were transporting from Neapolis.
00:47:19.253,00:47:21.589,Tell me what happened to her.
00:47:23.048,00:47:26.302,"We were attacked, on the road."
00:47:27.844,00:47:32.016,"They tried to get to her, but argh..."
00:47:32.141,00:47:33.934,Where is your wound?
00:47:34.059,00:47:37.313,Where is the wound you earned trying to save my wife?
00:47:39.315,00:47:40.983,Guard...
00:47:42.777,00:47:44.821,"Tell me, tell me!"
00:47:47.990,00:47:49.992,I only did...
00:47:50.117,00:47:51.994,as commanded...
00:47:52.119,00:47:54.288,Who spoke the words that took her life?
00:47:59.168,00:48:00.961,Who?!
00:48:03.297,00:48:05.550,Bat..ia.. tus..
00:48:24.193,00:48:25.486,What have you done?
00:48:27.363,00:48:29.532,Help me restore him.
00:48:31.908,00:48:35.580,You will secure my straps...
00:48:38.040,00:48:40.084,and never speak of this.
00:48:46.006,00:48:47.966,The wound did not appear fatal.
00:48:51.095,00:48:53.890,The damage was deeper than the eye could perceive.
00:48:54.014,00:48:56.225,Medicus tells he drowned in his own blood.
00:48:56.350,00:48:57.518,Oh.
00:48:57.643,00:49:01.063,A loose end.
00:49:01.188,00:49:03.274,Hm.
00:49:03.399,00:49:05.317,"You have played your part well, Ashur."
00:49:05.443,00:49:07.319,Was greater hand than mine that conceived it.
00:49:07.445,00:49:09.822,Solonius was easily deceived into believing you would betray me.
00:49:09.946,00:49:13.325,As I knew he would.
00:49:13.451,00:49:19.123,"A man who has no honor cannot imagine that trait in anyone else, and you, you have that quality above all others."
00:49:19.248,00:49:20.999,And shall be rewarded in kind.
00:49:21.125,00:49:22.334,"Your will, Dominus."
00:49:22.460,00:49:24.295,"Oh, oh."
00:49:24.420,00:49:26.297,The gods truly favor the House of Batiatus!
00:49:26.422,00:49:28.090,Behold!
00:49:28.215,00:49:30.008,Spartacus risen from the dead!
00:49:30.134,00:49:32.261,Spartacus!
00:49:36.056,00:49:37.433,You are well?
00:49:40.227,00:49:42.271,"Yes, Dominus."
00:49:43.314,00:49:45.274,I am myself again.
00:01:02.604,00:01:07.651,"It wounds my heart, to see a man once so elevated, plummet to such depths."
00:01:10.529,00:01:12.364,Your dog Ashur.
00:01:12.489,00:01:16.410,"Was he always upon your leash, even when licking my ass?"
00:01:16.535,00:01:18.161,His loyalty never wavered.
00:01:18.286,00:01:20.748,The man is most skilled in deceit.
00:01:20.873,00:01:23.959,Or perhaps you were too blinded by envy to perceive the truth.
00:01:24.083,00:01:25.669,You flatter yourself.
00:01:25.794,00:01:27.963,Did you not have eyes towards my ludus?
00:01:28.087,00:01:29.631,My champions?
00:01:29.757,00:01:31.633,My wife?
00:01:35.094,00:01:38.057,You would steal glory from the House of Batiatus.
00:01:38.181,00:01:42.394,Yet here you are with nothing but blood and sand for your efforts.
00:01:42.519,00:01:45.022,Capua will see you for what you are.
00:01:47.441,00:01:51.653,"The man who brought the Magistrate's murderer to justice, a hero of the people?"
00:01:51.779,00:01:54.573,"Ah, may the gods protect me from their wrath."
00:01:59.787,00:02:03.206,Crixus makes quick work of his opponent.
00:02:03.331,00:02:05.751,I must return to the pulvinus...
00:02:05.876,00:02:07.795,to announce your execution.
00:02:10.798,00:02:12.800,"Well played, Batiatus."
00:02:13.926,00:02:15.970,I underestimated you.
00:02:43.914,00:02:45.499,For you!
00:02:48.794,00:02:51.170,Crixus honors the memory of your husband.
00:02:51.296,00:02:52.840,As do we all.
00:02:54.549,00:02:57.011,We should put these dark times behind us...
00:02:59.763,00:03:01.682,and with Solonius' blood...
00:03:23.286,00:03:27.666,"I request words with Batiatus, yet you return absent the man."
00:03:30.251,00:03:33.463,I've pressed for audience all week.
00:03:33.588,00:03:35.423,Dominus forgets who his champion is.
00:03:35.549,00:03:40.888,"It is you who forgets title, master and slave."
00:03:46.101,00:03:48.478,Apologies.
00:03:48.603,00:03:52.107,I have made many mistakes since becoming Champion.
00:03:52.232,00:03:54.609,Know that I intend to rectify them shortly.
00:04:03.202,00:04:05.579,Good Citizens of Capua!
00:04:10.250,00:04:20.510,"I stand before you, the sting of tears yet hot upon my cheek, to redress a most vile crime against our city and our hearts."
00:04:22.554,00:04:25.515,The murder of Magistrate Titus Calavius!
00:04:30.229,00:04:35.859,His life stolen for lust of profit and advancement.
00:04:37.277,00:04:41.990,His warmth and guidance torn from our hands...
00:04:44.284,00:04:48.329,and those of loving wife and noble son!
00:04:50.165,00:04:53.127,Yet today we shall witness justice!
00:04:54.836,00:05:02.302,The base criminal that has so wounded us shall be executed ad gladium!
00:05:06.932,00:05:08.934,Enter Solonius!
00:05:09.851,00:05:11.770,Enemy of the people!
00:05:17.901,00:05:19.360,Fucking pig!
00:05:20.612,00:05:22.614,Traitor!
00:05:25.826,00:05:28.703,Slice his traitor tongue off!
00:05:28.829,00:05:30.413,You fucking pig!
00:05:51.726,00:05:53.603,And who shall balance the scales?
00:05:53.728,00:05:57.274,Who shall restore honor to our city?
00:05:57.398,00:06:00.986,CROWD: Spartacus!
00:06:02.946,00:06:05.282,There is but one man!
00:06:05.406,00:06:07.201,The Slayer of Theokoles!
00:06:07.326,00:06:08.952,The Bringer of Rain!
00:06:10.369,00:06:12.331,Spartacus...
00:06:12.455,00:06:18.461,Champion of Capua!
00:06:36.313,00:06:39.024,"You survived your execution, Thracian."
00:06:41.985,00:06:44.779,Perhaps good Solonius will fare as well.
00:06:45.947,00:06:47.991,I would not expect it.
00:06:58.543,00:06:59.961,Begin!
00:07:01.796,00:07:04.007,"Fight me, damn it!"
00:07:09.804,00:07:11.681,Why does Spartacus not strike in return?
00:07:11.806,00:07:15.310,"He but extends the moment, to the favor of the crowd."
00:07:15.435,00:07:17.562,The villain's blood will flow soon enough.
00:07:17.687,00:07:20.481,Your husband has been a gift from the gods.
00:07:20.607,00:07:23.318,Numerius would be lost without his support.
00:07:23.443,00:07:26.071,He gains great comfort in the act.
00:07:26.196,00:07:27.572,The comfort is ours.
00:07:32.619,00:07:34.579,"Look, Spartacus draws blood."
00:07:53.598,00:07:55.558,You are not absent skill.
00:07:55.683,00:07:57.060,Nor desire to live.
00:08:07.362,00:08:09.072,You see?
00:08:09.197,00:08:11.283,Solonius comes to his end.
00:08:11.408,00:08:13.743,And who would not wish it?
00:08:13.868,00:08:17.414,The streets of Rome are wet with tears of your loss.
00:08:19.624,00:08:23.086,"We have not received word from you, Ilithyia."
00:08:24.087,00:08:26.756,Did you speak to your husband?
00:08:26.881,00:08:29.092,About patronage for the House of Batiatus?
00:08:30.844,00:08:35.056,"He comes to Capua a day hence, to discuss the matter personally."
00:08:57.371,00:08:59.956,The roar of the crowd.
00:09:03.710,00:09:05.462,The last you shall hear.
00:09:06.963,00:09:08.923,You take the wrong life.
00:09:09.049,00:09:12.302,"Your master Batiatus, is the villain."
00:09:16.473,00:09:18.225,And shall join you presently.
00:09:24.481,00:09:26.107,CROWD: Kill! Kill! Kill!
00:10:11.986,00:10:15.615,CROWD: Spartacus!
00:10:27.252,00:10:31.047,BATIATUS: I would not have Agron risk himself on behalf of brotherly bond.
00:10:34.717,00:10:36.595,He grows restless at not receiving audience.
00:10:36.719,00:10:39.306,The proceedings with Solonius have filled my attentions.
00:10:39.431,00:10:41.391,Send Mira to occupy his thoughts.
00:10:41.516,00:10:43.268,I will summon him in the morning.
00:10:43.393,00:10:44.685,Dominus.
00:10:51.067,00:10:53.778,"Robes, fit for a man of breeding and intelligence!"
00:10:53.903,00:10:56.030,You wear them well.
00:10:56.156,00:10:58.116,Today day beheld the end of Solonius.
00:10:58.241,00:11:02.203,"A welcomed spectacle, given purchase by your loyalty and cunning."
00:11:02.329,00:11:05.373,You shall be removed from the ludus immediately.
00:11:06.958,00:11:08.001,Removed?
00:11:08.126,00:11:09.794,You'll reside in the villa.
00:11:09.919,00:11:15.342,"Elevated far above the common men, your devious fucking mind close to elbow."
00:11:21.764,00:11:24.683,Gratitude seizes the tongue.
00:11:24.809,00:11:28.229,Well perhaps a woman will aid in the untangling of it.
00:11:28.355,00:11:31.816,"Name any slave, and the wet joys of her body are yours."
00:11:35.153,00:11:38.281,I confess to certain longings.
00:11:40.074,00:11:44.829,For one not yet soiled by the other men.
00:11:44.954,00:11:47.624,"Give name to your desire, and see it fulfilled."
00:12:00.220,00:12:01.762,Apologies.
00:12:02.681,00:12:04.432,My presence was commanded.
00:12:07.060,00:12:08.727,By Batiatus?
00:12:08.853,00:12:11.481,His words set me to purpose.
00:12:11.606,00:12:13.483,But they were gladly received...
00:12:21.616,00:12:23.993,I tend your wound.
00:12:24.118,00:12:27.497,Stand guard at your request while you stain hands with blood.
00:12:29.332,00:12:31.459,And you discard a simple touch?
00:12:37.924,00:12:40.427,My mind is taken with other thoughts.
00:12:52.105,00:12:54.482,Then break open head and share them.
00:12:57.818,00:13:00.821,I fear Batiatus suspects my hand in Aulus' death.
00:13:03.074,00:13:04.867,Then why does he not grant me audience?
00:13:09.372,00:13:13.293,"What secrets did Aulus reveal in dying breath, that so inflamed?"
00:13:18.465,00:13:24.803,That his hand robbed Sura of life.
00:13:24.929,00:13:26.431,By command of Batiatus.
00:13:31.936,00:13:33.521,You plan vengeance!
00:13:39.569,00:13:41.655,You cannot do this!
00:13:43.239,00:13:47.201,Spartacus...
00:13:47.327,00:13:49.870,Never again will I hear her whisper my true name.
00:13:49.996,00:13:52.123,Or taste the joy of it on her lips.
00:13:54.041,00:13:59.673,"I will see the light fade from his eyes, or join her in the attempt."
00:13:59.798,00:14:01.716,At expense of my life?
00:14:04.803,00:14:07.221,The Thracian does not know Roman law!
00:14:09.098,00:14:13.645,If one slave spills the blood of his master...
00:14:14.688,00:14:16.606,all are put to death.
00:14:21.486,00:14:23.279,Each to his own fate.
00:14:25.031,00:14:26.658,And I to mine.
00:14:55.311,00:14:57.647,You move with strong purpose...
00:14:59.065,00:15:00.900,"Spurred, by your victory."
00:15:06.280,00:15:10.702,"When I defeated Pericles, and you were not in the pulvinus..."
00:15:15.122,00:15:19.669,"There is no meaning to glory, without your eyes to witness."
00:15:24.549,00:15:27.552,They will never again be absent.
00:15:34.308,00:15:35.894,LUCRETIA: Naevia?
00:15:37.019,00:15:39.021,Hurry!
00:15:39.146,00:15:40.440,Quickly!
00:15:46.654,00:15:48.072,Naevia!
00:15:49.657,00:15:51.158,Domina.
00:15:51.284,00:15:53.453,"What business do you attend, that you do not answer?"
00:15:53.578,00:15:55.288,"Fetching wine, Domina."
00:15:55.413,00:15:56.497,"Apologies, I did not hear.."
00:15:56.623,00:15:58.249,Leave it.
00:15:58.374,00:16:01.001,There is a service required of you by Dominus.
00:16:24.191,00:16:26.986,My heart quickens at such a vision.
00:16:28.028,00:16:29.697,Please...
00:16:31.532,00:16:33.033,Set mind to ease.
00:16:33.159,00:16:36.663,I cling to no grudge for past transgressions.
00:16:37.747,00:16:39.624,I do not understand.
00:16:39.749,00:16:45.505,"You spoke with Doctore, after it was said Barca secured his freedom."
00:16:45.630,00:16:47.423,I told him nothing.
00:16:47.548,00:16:49.383,A thing of no consequence.
00:16:50.551,00:16:51.594,Turn it from your thoughts.
00:16:51.719,00:16:54.347,As I have turned it from mine...
00:16:55.473,00:16:58.601,in favor of more...
00:16:58.726,00:17:00.645,intimate concerns...
00:17:02.897,00:17:06.025,I have admired your beauty for many years.
00:17:07.610,00:17:09.988,Were you aware of my affections?
00:17:11.405,00:17:14.617,I have felt your gaze linger of late.
00:17:16.369,00:17:21.123,A gaze is all I could dare....
00:17:21.248,00:17:25.003,your position placing you forever beyond my grasp.
00:17:26.629,00:17:32.927,"Delicate, ripe Naevia."
00:17:33.970,00:17:36.931,Always the forbidden fruit.
00:17:38.224,00:17:39.726,Until now...
00:17:44.522,00:17:46.065,You tremble.
00:17:59.453,00:18:01.915,Slipped inside of you...
00:18:03.332,00:18:06.085,Domina has seen me remain untouched.
00:18:09.422,00:18:11.799,Then we are both...
00:18:13.551,00:18:15.053,in her debt.
00:18:36.741,00:18:39.326,LUCRETIA: You give her away as if a common whore!
00:18:39.452,00:18:43.414,"I've preserved her chastity since she was a child, towards presenting it as gift!"
00:18:43.539,00:18:46.208,The only gift of chastity is in its removal.
00:18:46.333,00:18:47.961,By a man of worth!
00:18:48.086,00:18:50.797,Not fucking Ashur!
00:18:53.299,00:18:56.218,Naevia has been my most trusted slave.
00:18:56.343,00:19:02.475,The thought of that fucking Syrian shoving his devious cock inside her...
00:19:04.268,00:19:05.812,It is a necessity.
00:19:05.937,00:19:10.232,"Set details of it aside, and shift mind to Glaber's arrival."
00:19:15.446,00:19:18.658,When the sun rises on the House of Batiatus...
00:19:20.409,00:19:21.911,everything will change.
00:20:16.298,00:20:19.677,CRIXUS: Your wooden man gives almost as much fight as Solonius.
00:20:22.513,00:20:27.810,"With each victory, I draw closer to facing you again in the arena."
00:20:27.935,00:20:29.979,And reclaiming stolen glories.
00:20:30.104,00:20:32.148,There is no glory.
00:20:32.314,00:20:34.150,Only blood.
00:20:34.274,00:20:36.527,Spilled for the pleasure of the Romans.
00:20:36.652,00:20:41.074,"And how they shall roar, when I spill your blood upon the sands."
00:20:42.533,00:20:45.203,Spartacus!
00:20:45.327,00:20:46.787,You are summoned.
00:20:53.335,00:20:55.129,I fear you will never have the chance.
00:21:01.552,00:21:03.930,BATIATUS: Watch what you're fucking doing!
00:21:05.056,00:21:06.390,Fuck.
00:21:06.515,00:21:07.683,Be careful with that!
00:21:07.808,00:21:08.976,Dominus.
00:21:09.810,00:21:10.937,Where are the flowers?
00:21:15.066,00:21:17.443,"A house full of slaves, have to do fucking everything myself."
00:21:17.568,00:21:22.823,Ah! The Champion of Capua graces us with his presence!
00:21:22.949,00:21:26.160,Apologies for not receiving you sooner.
00:21:26.285,00:21:29.830,I have been consumed with the tumult of recent events.
00:21:31.624,00:21:34.001,Much has changed.
00:21:34.127,00:21:40.424,"The world reforms at our feet, the very earth thrusting us to unimaginable heights!"
00:21:45.429,00:21:46.722,At great cost.
00:21:47.890,00:21:53.395,At this very moment Legatus Glaber thunders towards us to bestow patronage.
00:21:57.399,00:22:03.114,"I would ask that they be put aside, in favor of more noble pursuits."
00:22:04.615,00:22:07.576,Glaber took Sura from my arms.
00:22:08.911,00:22:12.081,But he is not the man that took her life.
00:22:17.795,00:22:19.379,Aurelia?
00:22:23.759,00:22:24.635,Would that be all?
00:22:24.760,00:22:26.804,"Yep, fine, leave."
00:22:26.929,00:22:28.430,What is she doing here?
00:22:28.555,00:22:31.767,"Working beneath my employ, to pay off Varro's debts."
00:22:31.892,00:22:33.519,I pledged my winnings to such a cause.
00:22:33.644,00:22:36.647,You did not tell her this?
00:22:36.772,00:22:42.987,"She would have no coin from your purse, nor mine, unless it was obtained by means of fair labor."
00:22:48.575,00:22:50.870,She is a good woman.
00:22:50.995,00:22:52.746,And worthy of consideration.
00:22:52.872,00:22:54.790,And she shall receive it in abundance.
00:22:54.915,00:22:59.212,"Now tell me, what matter were you so eager to discuss with me?"
00:22:59.337,00:23:04.675,"I merely sought word towards Varro's wife, and that she had been provided for."
00:23:07.928,00:23:09.805,Excellent!
00:23:09.930,00:23:12.308,So all is well between us.
00:23:22.068,00:23:24.695,I require words with Spartacus.
00:23:24.820,00:23:27.531,Why the fuck would I allow that?
00:23:27.656,00:23:31.077,Because my tongue remains silent towards the gate key you lost.
00:23:31.202,00:23:33.620,You would have it remain so?
00:23:34.538,00:23:36.082,Be quick.
00:23:42.462,00:23:44.924,"Opportunity presents itself, yet Batiatus lives."
00:23:46.675,00:23:51.638,Last night the lives of every slave under this roof meant nothing to you.
00:23:51.764,00:23:54.100,"Then Aurelia appears, and you grow a conscience!"
00:23:54.225,00:23:56.936,Varro was as a brother.
00:23:57.061,00:23:59.188,I will not see his wife put at risk.
00:24:26.673,00:24:28.050,A parting gift.
00:24:29.676,00:24:32.221,What is this shit?
00:24:32.346,00:24:35.224,A memento of your battle with Theokoles.
00:24:35.349,00:24:40.854,The city was filled with such novelties after Spartacus brought the rains.
00:24:40.980,00:24:42.982,The craftsmanship was rather poor.
00:24:43.107,00:24:46.484,Dominus finally decides to remove you from the company of men?
00:24:46.610,00:24:48.195,Far removed.
00:24:50.448,00:24:52.950,I have been given favored quarters within the villa.
00:24:53.075,00:24:55.911,To serve as our master's right hand.
00:24:57.121,00:24:58.831,The one he wipes his ass with.
00:24:58.956,00:25:01.667,"Ah, a witty turn of phrase."
00:25:01.792,00:25:05.503,One of many splendors I shall miss of being a gladiator.
00:25:05.629,00:25:07.505,You were never a gladiator.
00:25:11.093,00:25:12.928,No.
00:25:13.053,00:25:15.639,Not after your blade found itself in my leg.
00:25:19.810,00:25:22.104,One that has given great reward.
00:25:28.568,00:25:33.699,"Everything I am, everything I now possess, I owe to you."
00:25:43.750,00:25:46.295,"No, that goes to the balcony."
00:25:46.420,00:25:48.506,"Quickly, the Legatus arrives."
00:25:48.630,00:25:50.632,The new girl is slow to the task.
00:25:52.426,00:25:55.888,We shall yet find proper use for her.
00:25:57.723,00:25:59.517,One that shall be remembered.
00:26:06.399,00:26:07.233,Where is the Legatus?
00:26:07.358,00:26:10.027,Apologies.
00:26:10.152,00:26:12.279,But you made promise.
00:26:12.405,00:26:13.864,Which will be well kept.
00:26:13.989,00:26:21.038,"He yet intends proper visit, but requests good Batiatus give greeting upon entering the city."
00:26:21.163,00:26:22.498,A great honor!
00:26:22.622,00:26:23.999,When does he arrive?
00:26:24.124,00:26:25.418,Now.
00:26:27.585,00:26:29.004,We must hurry!
00:26:32.132,00:26:33.884,Come.
00:26:34.009,00:26:36.262,Let us retire to the balcony to feast.
00:26:36.387,00:26:38.638,And review your sense of timing.
00:26:38.764,00:26:45.187,"I would love nothing more, but I must return to the villa to gather my belongings."
00:26:45.979,00:26:47.314,To what end?
00:26:47.440,00:26:49.567,I'm moving back to Rome!
00:26:51.527,00:26:54.530,But your stay in Capua has been so brief.
00:26:54.654,00:26:56.282,Painfully.
00:26:56.407,00:27:01.579,"Yet now that my husband campaigns for Praetor, he insists I remain at his side."
00:27:03.789,00:27:04.873,Are you well?
00:27:04.998,00:27:07.709,The blood drains from your cheeks.
00:27:07.834,00:27:11.004,My heart but flutters at the...
00:27:11.130,00:27:12.756,the thought of losing you.
00:27:14.592,00:27:19.472,Memories of our time together will fade only with difficulty.
00:27:20.889,00:27:25.811,"Your friendship, Lucretia, has forever altered my life."
00:27:50.877,00:27:52.963,Spartacus.
00:27:53.088,00:27:55.090,I would make request.
00:27:55.215,00:27:57.968,"Ask another, if you seek it granted."
00:27:58.093,00:28:00.929,"It is not for me, but for my brother."
00:28:06.852,00:28:09.062,Batiatus orders us parted.
00:28:09.188,00:28:11.607,Duro greets the news with laugh and fucking smile.
00:28:11.773,00:28:14.943,Yet I fear he shall not survive the arena on his own.
00:28:20.533,00:28:24.244,A word from your lips could see the decision undone.
00:28:54.816,00:28:56.360,Yeah!
00:29:06.078,00:29:08.038,Legatus Glaber!
00:29:08.163,00:29:10.749,Your arrival honors the fair city of Capua!
00:29:10.874,00:29:14.545,An honor I expected matched by greeting at the gate.
00:29:14.670,00:29:16.255,Well apologies.
00:29:16.380,00:29:18.591,Let us move past it.
00:29:18.716,00:29:22.511,My ears burn with reports of lawlessness since last I visited.
00:29:22.636,00:29:24.930,The Magistrate's murder was unfortunate...
00:29:25.055,00:29:26.973,As was that of Ovidius and his family.
00:29:31.604,00:29:34.981,"Let us retire to my villa, and we can discuss these and other matters at length."
00:29:35.107,00:29:37.359,I prefer to speak with someone in authority.
00:29:37.484,00:29:38.985,Good Mercato awaits.
00:29:39.111,00:29:40.362,I shall accompany you?
00:29:40.487,00:29:41.780,That won't be necessary.
00:29:41.905,00:29:43.490,Await me at your villa.
00:29:43.616,00:29:44.617,When shall I expect you?
00:29:44.742,00:29:46.076,When I arrive.
00:29:50.997,00:29:53.208,Crixus!
00:29:55.085,00:29:59.089,"I long for the night, to continue what was last interrupted."
00:29:59.214,00:30:00.882,I cannot meet you.
00:30:02.635,00:30:04.177,Tis but one night.
00:30:04.303,00:30:06.054,There's no cause for this.
00:30:06.846,00:30:08.181,"Yes, cause."
00:30:08.307,00:30:11.226,Enough to drown us both in tears.
00:30:15.147,00:30:17.399,Dominus has given me to another.
00:30:20.444,00:30:23.447,Who? Tell me his name!
00:30:24.948,00:30:25.991,What does it matter?
00:30:26.116,00:30:27.534,We have lived in a dream.
00:30:27.660,00:30:29.578,And now we must awaken.
00:30:36.042,00:30:38.420,"Do not be troubled, mighty Crixus."
00:30:40.631,00:30:44.134,Capua cheers your name once more.
00:30:44.259,00:30:47.971,Soon you will seize the mantle of Champion from that fucking Thracian.
00:30:48.096,00:30:53.686,And everything shall be as it was before you fell to Theokoles.
00:30:55.103,00:30:57.439,I long for it to be so.
00:30:58.898,00:31:00.233,As do I.
00:31:09.951,00:31:11.453,Something's wrong...
00:31:13.205,00:31:14.748,"Apologies, Domina."
00:31:19.878,00:31:21.254,Naevia!
00:31:28.136,00:31:32.432,"The shit fuck beckons me to the city, only to spurn me like a thin wasted whore!"
00:31:32.558,00:31:38.313,Once again the gods spread the cheeks to ram cock in fucking ass!
00:31:44.110,00:31:47.155,Glaber will bend to my fucking will.
00:31:47.280,00:31:49.157,Or break in the denying of it.
00:31:49.282,00:31:50.743,Lucretia!
00:31:50.868,00:31:52.536,You need to have fucking words with Ilithyia...
00:31:55.205,00:31:56.498,What's happened?
00:31:58.250,00:32:00.001,I am with child.
00:32:02.421,00:32:04.381,"You're to be a father, Quintus."
00:32:08.968,00:32:09.762,"Well, wine!"
00:32:09.887,00:32:11.304,"Wine for the fucking house, eh!"
00:32:11.430,00:32:12.765,We must celebrate!
00:32:15.183,00:32:16.560,We must celebrate.
00:32:23.108,00:32:24.902,GABLER: This fucking village.
00:32:27.362,00:32:28.822,Finally.
00:32:28.947,00:32:30.699,I had feared you absorbed for the night.
00:32:30.824,00:32:33.786,The curse of Mercato's incompetence.
00:32:35.078,00:32:39.833,"Cousin of Crassus vanishes, and no theory rattles around in his empty head."
00:32:39.958,00:32:42.878,Theories pale against the obvious.
00:32:43.002,00:32:48.759,Licinia's tongue was suspected of lounging in less esteemed places than around her husband's cock...
00:32:50.218,00:32:55.808,Whereas mine has made do with naught but idle conversation.
00:33:02.147,00:33:06.610,What promises have you made Batiatus and his faded bitch?
00:33:06.735,00:33:11.615,"The flesh monger looks to me with rheumy eyes, brimming with expectation."
00:33:11.740,00:33:20.958,"I promise nothing, save word on their behalf to my dearly missed husband..."
00:33:21.834,00:33:28.841,Batiatus is little better than the beasts that bear his mark.
00:33:28.966,00:33:32.886,"True, but they do provide a certain amusement."
00:33:37.599,00:33:39.935,Humor their intent.
00:33:40.059,00:33:42.646,No more can be asked from a man of your station.
00:33:46.024,00:33:50.153,"My promise discharged, and we shall return to Rome."
00:34:14.427,00:34:16.095,Fetch another.
00:34:16.221,00:34:17.848,And hold onto it this time.
00:34:22.853,00:34:24.437,Aurelia.
00:34:25.313,00:34:26.648,I beg a moment.
00:34:28.901,00:34:30.443,Alone.
00:34:35.490,00:34:37.283,You cannot be under the care of Batiatus.
00:34:37.409,00:34:38.368,The deed is done.
00:34:38.493,00:34:40.704,Then I shall see it undone.
00:34:40.829,00:34:42.205,My winnings in the arena...
00:34:42.330,00:34:43.832,Are not fucking wanted.
00:34:45.458,00:34:47.627,Varro asked that I see you taken care of.
00:34:47.753,00:34:49.462,Then return him to me.
00:34:55.552,00:34:56.845,Varro's son.
00:34:58.430,00:35:00.098,He is safe?
00:35:02.517,00:35:04.519,To be raised free of his father's debt.
00:35:04.644,00:35:06.104,Absent his mother.
00:35:08.356,00:35:10.901,What of the child in carry?
00:35:13.152,00:35:15.530,It was not fathered by Varro.
00:35:18.283,00:35:19.701,Without him I...
00:35:27.876,00:35:29.836,As I would be from yours.
00:35:31.755,00:35:33.799,Batiatus is not to be trusted.
00:35:35.592,00:35:36.676,Do not lay faith in him.
00:35:36.802,00:35:39.805,My husband is dead.
00:35:39.930,00:35:42.099,And with him all faith.
00:35:54.527,00:36:00.742,"All will marvel upon privileged entry, and be humbled by the storied history of the House of Batiatus!"
00:36:00.867,00:36:02.577,It is a vast improvement.
00:36:02.702,00:36:05.872,"Hm, the gods have truly blessed them."
00:36:05.998,00:36:07.707,And continue to do so.
00:36:07.833,00:36:12.587,"If fortune so favors, why do you continue to press so brazenly for my support?"
00:36:12.712,00:36:16.174,True fortune extends no further than a man's ambitions.
00:36:16.299,00:36:19.052,Mine stretch well beyond the sands of the arena.
00:36:20.178,00:36:21.220,How far beyond?
00:36:21.346,00:36:23.932,To the very doors of political office.
00:36:26.101,00:36:28.311,In a minor capacity.
00:36:29.562,00:36:32.524,"Well, let us entertain it for a moment."
00:36:32.649,00:36:35.777,What men of status lend you their confidence?
00:36:35.902,00:36:38.363,Magistrate Calavius had voiced his endorsement.
00:36:42.200,00:36:43.284,Base villain.
00:36:43.409,00:36:47.246,The way he would stare with his teeth.
00:36:47.372,00:36:50.792,My heart is moved by the tragedy.
00:36:50.917,00:36:53.086,Yet my head remains fixed.
00:36:54.379,00:36:59.009,What advantage would I gain by association with a lanista?
00:36:59.134,00:37:01.803,My gladiators ignite the passion of the crowd.
00:37:01.928,00:37:13.356,"Lend name to my cause, and see their deafening cheers transformed into demands for Claudius Glaber, and his desired position of Praetor."
00:37:18.236,00:37:21.031,They do favor Batiatus' men like no others.
00:37:22.574,00:37:23.992,Especially Spartacus.
00:37:26.953,00:37:29.247,The Thracian.
00:37:29.372,00:37:33.334,And what does it say that your finest gladiator was my worst soldier?
00:37:34.669,00:37:37.130,That I am the greatest lanista in the Republic.
00:37:37.255,00:37:40.592,"For I have taken a wild beast, and forged him into a god."
00:37:40.717,00:37:42.844,Its a bold claim.
00:37:42.969,00:37:46.389,Built on a foundation of fucking granite.
00:37:46.514,00:37:48.516,I would see your words made flesh.
00:37:48.641,00:37:49.642,Easily conjured.
00:37:49.768,00:37:51.352,Spartacus trains in the square with the other men.
00:37:51.477,00:37:56.942,"I have descended into the bowels of your ludus once before, and did not care for the stench."
00:37:57.067,00:38:00.112,"Summon the Thracian to the villa, along with the rest of your men."
00:38:01.696,00:38:03.489,All of them?
00:38:03.615,00:38:05.033,All of them.
00:38:25.804,00:38:29.432,The Champion of Capua.
00:38:29.557,00:38:34.854,A sad day when an honored city elevates a cur to such position.
00:38:39.234,00:38:42.695,I see you've taught the animal not to speak out of turn.
00:38:45.031,00:38:48.994,And I would have demonstration of other tricks the Thracian has learned.
00:38:50.578,00:38:52.080,Unchain him.
00:39:01.923,00:39:04.050,Which of my men would you have oppose him?
00:39:04.176,00:39:05.551,None.
00:39:06.344,00:39:08.013,Formation.
00:39:18.731,00:39:20.900,Spartacus wields practice swords.
00:39:21.026,00:39:23.528,I fear he's at a disadvantage.
00:39:23.653,00:39:26.656,I but give him chance to prove his legend.
00:39:27.907,00:39:29.326,Iovis.
00:39:40.212,00:39:41.963,How exciting.
00:39:43.589,00:39:45.008,Begin!
00:40:07.113,00:40:08.990,Vesper! Linus!
00:40:10.700,00:40:11.409,Legatus...
00:40:11.534,00:40:12.869,"You opened this door, lanista."
00:40:12.994,00:40:14.746,And we shall pass through it.
00:42:30.423,00:42:31.966,Behold.
00:42:32.091,00:42:33.926,The legend is proved.
00:42:36.179,00:42:37.555,Dominus.
00:42:39.640,00:42:43.061,This savage caused Rome great offense!
00:42:43.186,00:42:46.647,Yet it would appear that you have broken the man.
00:42:48.691,00:42:52.362,The way he bows his head in deference.
00:42:52.487,00:42:58.243,"Would I be afforded such courtesies, I wonder, if patronage were awarded?"
00:42:58.368,00:43:01.662,"He would be yours to command, as would all my men."
00:43:04.541,00:43:06.292,Kneel.
00:43:06.418,00:43:08.044,And it shall be so.
00:43:22.850,00:43:24.227,Legatus.
00:44:04.225,00:44:06.060,Crixus!
00:44:06.185,00:44:08.229,You fucking cunt!
00:44:12.317,00:44:14.068,Calm yourself!
00:44:14.193,00:44:14.944,Slaves running wild!
00:44:17.780,00:44:21.200,What seizes your fucking wits? Speak!
00:44:21.326,00:44:24.245,"I yet but touch my gift, and Crixus goes mad."
00:44:27.039,00:44:28.958,I felt her maidenhood long absent when we lay together.
00:44:29.083,00:44:31.836,Now I know whose cock was in her first.
00:44:38.301,00:44:39.802,LUCRETIA: You whore!
00:44:41.095,00:44:43.889,How fucking long?
00:44:44.015,00:44:47.059,How long have you hidden laughter Behind a polite smile!
00:44:48.269,00:44:53.024,How long have you been luring him to your filthy slave cunt?
00:44:58.279,00:45:01.115,What is it?
00:45:01.240,00:45:03.451,Give it to me.
00:45:07.205,00:45:08.873,How did you come by it?
00:45:08.998,00:45:11.334,I took it.
00:45:11.459,00:45:13.836,To open the gate.
00:45:15.505,00:45:18.257,You alone knew of my feelings for him.
00:45:18.383,00:45:20.843,And yet you betray me.
00:45:26.474,00:45:28.643,Crixus never loved you.
00:45:28.767,00:45:30.395,He did only as commanded.
00:45:42.699,00:45:44.075,Domina.
00:45:47.995,00:45:49.330,Bring me a knife.
00:45:54.085,00:45:56.713,You have assurance Crixus will be punished.
00:45:56.837,00:45:58.964,I fear your hands too soft for the task.
00:45:59.090,00:46:02.301,You are mistaken.
00:45:59.090,00:46:04.679,"They are as steel, hardened to their purpose."
00:46:04.803,00:46:06.389,As I to mine.
00:46:06.514,00:46:09.225,"We return to Rome, absent unworthy entanglements."
00:46:09.350,00:46:11.269,Do not turn from me!
00:46:11.394,00:46:13.438,"You forget your place, lanista!"
00:46:13.563,00:46:15.064,No. I secure it.
00:46:16.190,00:46:17.400,Clear the fucking room!
00:46:17.525,00:46:20.819,Tell Ashur to bring our gift for the Legatus!
00:46:21.778,00:46:24.031,Forget your gifts.
00:46:24.156,00:46:27.868,"I would part as from a troubling dream, untethered by the memory of it."
00:46:27.993,00:46:28.827,Oh you will remember this day.
00:46:28.953,00:46:32.206,"Until you lay to slumber, never to awaken."
00:46:32.331,00:46:35.418,I fear we have let events run the best of us.
00:46:35.543,00:46:38.129,"Perhaps a cup of wine to er, cool the head."
00:46:44.302,00:46:45.595,As would I.
00:46:47.639,00:46:50.308,Can I believe this will make a difference?
00:46:50.433,00:46:51.934,Open it and see.
00:46:59.651,00:47:01.778,What is this abomination?
00:47:01.902,00:47:04.322,But a piece of the whole.
00:47:04.447,00:47:05.531,Licinia.
00:47:05.657,00:47:07.116,Cousin of Crassus.
00:47:08.451,00:47:10.411,You murdered Licinia?
00:47:10.536,00:47:14.206,No. Your wife did.
00:47:14.332,00:47:15.291,He lies.
00:47:15.416,00:47:17.001,A most heinous act.
00:47:17.126,00:47:23.174,"One I was content to help obscure, under promise of her aid in obtaining your favor."
00:47:23.299,00:47:25.842,Now I fear Licinia's body may resurface.
00:47:27.011,00:47:29.888,"On the grounds of your villa, perhaps?"
00:47:30.014,00:47:32.517,I will see the tongue ripped from your fucking mouth!
00:47:32.642,00:47:35.269,"Even so ruined, it would yet speak the truth."
00:47:36.312,00:47:38.063,Cladius.
00:47:38.189,00:47:40.483,You cannot believe me capable of such a thing.
00:47:58.710,00:48:00.919,Patronage is granted.
00:48:01.045,00:48:07.259,A portion of my men will remain stationed against further embarrassments.
00:48:09.470,00:48:12.264,Make all other arrangements with Ilithyia.
00:48:12.390,00:48:14.433,She will be remaining here in Capua.
00:48:14.559,00:48:15.976,No!
00:48:38.457,00:48:44.505,No man is above retribution for offenses committed against the House of Batiatus.
00:48:44.630,00:48:46.257,No gladiator.
00:48:46.382,00:48:47.633,No Champion.
00:48:48.843,00:48:55.600,"Even the men that guard you, should they be guilty of deceit or incompetence."
00:48:55.725,00:48:57.435,Hector found his key removed.
00:48:57.560,00:49:00.979,His head follows.
00:49:01.105,00:49:05.568,"The fault lies in my own breast, with heart grown too large."
00:49:06.569,00:49:08.529,This cannot stand.
00:49:08.654,00:49:13.117,Legatus Claudius Glaber is now our honored Patron.
00:49:13.242,00:49:17.413,And he has opened my eyes to the error of my generosity.
00:49:18.748,00:49:20.708,One that demands correction.
00:49:27.131,00:49:29.216,Embrace the pain.
00:49:29.341,00:49:31.135,It is the only way.
00:50:26.231,00:50:29.067,I expect your meetings with Crixus to end.
00:50:31.737,00:50:33.155,Quintus...
00:50:33.280,00:50:35.324,Do not fucking speak.
00:50:37.660,00:50:44.375,That you would think me a fool is insult enough.
00:50:44.500,00:50:46.418,I have always known.
00:50:46.544,00:50:50.673,"And turned eye away only because it made you happy, and caused me no thought."
00:50:51.549,00:50:53.425,Those days have ended.
00:50:55.761,00:50:59.431,Set your attentions towards our child.
00:50:59.557,00:51:01.308,And do not see them stray.
00:51:01.433,00:51:02.727,Enough!
00:51:21.370,00:51:22.788,Crixus!
00:51:24.080,00:51:25.499,Crixus!
00:51:27.125,00:51:28.460,Grant them a moment.
00:51:28.586,00:51:30.629,He was our Champion once.
00:51:30.755,00:51:32.256,Allow him such respect.
00:51:45.519,00:51:47.897,I have destroyed us.
00:51:50.232,00:51:51.734,We yet live.
00:51:52.735,00:51:54.194,Where do they take you?
00:51:54.319,00:51:56.238,I do not know.
00:51:59.450,00:52:01.493,I will win my freedom.
00:52:01.619,00:52:04.538,I will not rest until I find you.
00:52:05.330,00:52:06.832,It is time.
00:52:14.506,00:52:17.509,"He speaks of freedom, as did Barca."
00:52:17.635,00:52:20.136,"I give you my word, that I shall aid him in the seeking of it."
00:52:25.517,00:52:26.978,Barca was not freed.
00:52:28.270,00:52:29.897,Batiatus took his life.
00:52:40.658,00:52:42.952,"Fuck ass, you Roman cock."
00:52:45.496,00:52:47.331,Shut your fucking mouth.
00:52:48.540,00:52:51.335,I would caution softer words.
00:52:51.460,00:52:55.131,The shit keeps rising higher in this fucking hole.
00:52:55.255,00:52:59.510,"Perhaps it best not to be present, when it fills the mouth."
00:53:02.638,00:53:04.431,What do you speak of?
00:53:04.556,00:53:05.933,I speak of nothing.
00:53:07.434,00:53:09.937,Nothing sounds much like escape.
00:53:11.730,00:53:15.943,And how would nothing find way past Batiatus and all his fucking Romans?
00:53:18.445,00:53:20.238,There is but one path.
00:53:22.116,00:53:23.868,We kill them all.
00:00:40.374,00:00:41.917,Mind them.
00:01:09.653,00:01:12.614,The noble House of Batiatus stands humbled!
00:01:14.616,00:01:21.916,Humbled by the blessings the gods have seen fit to shower upon us.
00:01:22.041,00:01:32.133,"And by the presence of the most revered citizens in all of Capua, come to join in celebrating the patronage of Legatus Claudius Glaber!"
00:01:32.259,00:01:41.602,"The man himself regrets the duties of the senate prevent his attendance, but he would see us properly addressed, his words delivered by pleasing tongue of trusted wife."
00:01:45.230,00:01:48.442,Good citizens of Rome's favored sister.
00:01:48.567,00:01:59.578,"It is with great pleasure that I, Legatus Claudius Glaber, bestow upon Quintus Lentulus Batiatus my patronage, and all encompassing benefits."
00:01:59.703,00:02:04.249,No man in all of Capua is more deserving of such esteemed privilege.
00:02:04.374,00:02:08.879,Good Batiatus should be held as example to a city mired in shadows and treachery.
00:02:09.004,00:02:14.969,The guiding light of his virtuous heart providing illumination in these dark and troubling times.
00:02:15.094,00:02:18.138,For this reason and too many others to give voice...
00:02:18.263,00:02:20.432,Still yourself.
00:02:20.557,00:02:25.813,I lend my full and unconditional support to the honored position of Aedile.
00:02:25.938,00:02:28.649,Aemilia failed to mention you had mind towards office.
00:02:28.774,00:02:30.358,"Oh, I admit to none, good Sextus."
00:02:30.484,00:02:32.736,Until the Legatus broached the subject.
00:02:35.363,00:02:37.282,Aedile is but a breath below Magistrate.
00:02:37.407,00:02:38.867,Um.
00:02:43.204,00:02:47.126,My heart to Legatus Glaber and his support.
00:02:53.548,00:02:58.303,"Two legends of the arena, to face each other sine missione!"
00:02:58.428,00:02:59.805,No quarter given!
00:02:59.930,00:03:01.556,No mercy shown!
00:03:02.307,00:03:04.893,"Behold, Crixus!"
00:03:05.019,00:03:07.688,The savage Gaul!
00:03:12.567,00:03:13.986,And who shall attempt to tame him?
00:03:15.362,00:03:17.948,There can be but one man.
00:03:18.073,00:03:19.950,Spartacus!
00:03:20.075,00:03:22.119,Slayer of the Shadow of Death!
00:03:29.543,00:03:31.294,"He is of a form, is he not?"
00:03:33.714,00:03:35.382,He stands a god.
00:03:37.425,00:03:38.802,Crixus...
00:03:38.927,00:03:41.096,I have given my answer.
00:03:41.221,00:03:42.848,Let us finish this.
00:03:53.525,00:03:54.860,Begin!
00:04:38.695,00:04:40.530,We live in dangerous times.
00:04:45.535,00:04:48.163,Many yet hold Crixus our true champion.
00:04:54.878,00:04:56.671,Doctore.
00:04:56.797,00:04:58.215,I would work the palus.
00:05:00.508,00:05:02.343,Permission for Spartacus.
00:05:15.774,00:05:16.984,He is with us.
00:05:18.359,00:05:24.491,But Castus and the other Gauls refuse to grab cock without Crixus holding their balls.
00:05:24.616,00:05:27.035,Where does Rhaskos stand?
00:05:30.205,00:05:32.582,Our numbers are yet shallow.
00:05:36.711,00:05:38.172,The fucking mad mans still under lock and key.
00:05:39.756,00:05:42.092,How will you turn him to cause if you cannot break words with him?
00:05:42.217,00:05:43.969,Being champion yet affords privilege.
00:05:44.970,00:05:46.554,A way shall present itself.
00:05:46.680,00:05:47.388,Answer!
00:05:47.514,00:05:49.891,It best present fucking soon.
00:05:50.017,00:05:51.601,Did I tell you to stand?
00:05:56.898,00:06:02.737,"Glaber falls to patronage, and the men of influence greet me as a fucking brother!"
00:06:02.863,00:06:05.324,A day of shining glory.
00:06:05.448,00:06:07.284,Marred by darkening cloud.
00:06:08.409,00:06:10.204,"I beg a word, Dominus."
00:06:10.329,00:06:12.039,In private.
00:06:14.624,00:06:19.504,"Doctore, well spill sour thoughts, and hear them sweetened."
00:06:19.629,00:06:23.466,Glaber's mercenaries punish absent cause.
00:06:23.591,00:06:25.010,The men suffer at their hand.
00:06:25.135,00:06:29.597,It is a burden that must be endured I have no time for such petty concerns.
00:06:29.723,00:06:34.769,"With respect, every ludus requires the attention of its lanista."
00:06:34.895,00:06:38.481,"I seek a loftier title, one far removed from the arena."
00:06:38.606,00:06:41.318,You would see your family's heritage a thing of memory?
00:06:41.442,00:06:42.652,No.
00:06:42.777,00:06:52.371,"Yet I tire of the dust and drudgery, and I would have my interests in blood and sand overseen by someone with more attentive eyes."
00:06:52.495,00:06:54.706,Someone who has forever proven loyal.
00:06:57.376,00:06:59.878,You would entrust the ludus to a slave?
00:07:00.003,00:07:03.548,"A slave, never."
00:07:03.673,00:07:09.428,"I had thought to make announcement at the celebration, but you force my hand."
00:07:09.554,00:07:12.974,My advocate is drawing up papers granting your freedom.
00:07:13.100,00:07:14.142,Freedom?
00:07:14.268,00:07:15.769,No longer shall you be my Doctore.
00:07:15.894,00:07:21.316,"You will assume the mantle of lanista, and be warmly greeted by your name, Oenomaus."
00:07:23.235,00:07:25.570,I had thought the news to please.
00:07:25.695,00:07:30.658,"Apologies, I have heard rumor."
00:07:30.784,00:07:31.910,One that has vexed sleep.
00:07:32.035,00:07:34.246,"Well give voice, and dream again."
00:07:36.915,00:07:39.167,Barca was not granted freedom.
00:07:56.559,00:07:58.645,The rumor is true.
00:07:58.770,00:08:01.315,Yet absent reasoning.
00:08:01.440,00:08:04.651,Barca was dispatched to deliver a simple message to Ovidius.
00:08:04.776,00:08:08.863,"Instead he slaughtered the man and his entire fucking family, against command."
00:08:10.698,00:08:15.662,"I had no choice but to take his life, before the Magistrate discovered the deed and pulled us all to ruin."
00:08:15.787,00:08:16.871,And Ashur?
00:08:16.997,00:08:19.833,Did he aid in this choice?
00:08:29.384,00:08:31.803,And know your measure by how your blade falls.
00:08:40.687,00:08:44.899,"Can you yet feel him move, eager to make entrance into the world?"
00:08:45.025,00:08:46.526,How do you divine a boy?
00:08:46.651,00:08:49.696,Because the gods fucking favor us.
00:08:49.821,00:08:54.909,"Glaber's patronage, access to the upper strata of Capua, the promise of political office."
00:08:55.035,00:08:58.955,"Everything we have bled for, finally within our grasp."
00:08:59.080,00:09:01.749,We are truly blessed.
00:09:04.044,00:09:08.089,"I deliver but glorious news this day, to be met with tempered response!"
00:09:08.215,00:09:12.593,Joy is restrained to lend clear mind to celebration.
00:09:12.719,00:09:17.432,"Glaber's patronage may have paved road to the elite, but they are of ravenous appetite."
00:09:17.557,00:09:20.560,And what meal would you suggest to see them sated?
00:09:20.685,00:09:23.688,One that only the House of Batiatus can prepare.
00:09:23.813,00:09:28.568,"Spartacus, Slayer of Theokoles, in a contest to the death."
00:09:30.153,00:09:33.781,We have already presented such diversion at Numerius' Toga Virilis.
00:09:33.907,00:09:36.910,Varro was no match for the Champion of Capua.
00:09:37.035,00:09:39.620,We must give them what was denied that night.
00:09:39.746,00:09:45.001,"What all of Capua longs to see, but only a privileged few under our roof may bear witness to."
00:09:45.126,00:09:53.051,"The Champion of Capua, Spartacus in a fight for his life against the only man who has ever defeated him."
00:09:54.802,00:09:56.763,Is this your fucking hope?
00:09:56.888,00:09:59.766,That the fallen Gaul is granted opportunity to regain position?
00:10:00.225,00:10:01.809,Out.
00:10:04.271,00:10:07.357,You mistake intent.
00:10:07.482,00:10:11.194,"I would see Crixus dead, for offenses committed against the House of Batiatus."
00:10:11.319,00:10:13.113,Then we stand as one in such regard.
00:10:15.073,00:10:17.075,Oh your tongue named cause of doubt.
00:10:17.200,00:10:21.079,Crixus is the only gladiator to pose threat to Spartacus.
00:10:21.204,00:10:27.919,And there is yet political advantage to parading the Bringer of Rain as I campaign for office.
00:10:28.044,00:10:32.591,Then we must ensure Spartacus victorious.
00:10:46.605,00:10:48.482,That will be all.
00:10:51.651,00:10:53.987,Patronage comes with unfortunate attachment.
00:10:55.029,00:10:56.656,A fact I am well aware of.
00:10:58.199,00:11:03.204,"I am reminded of the first time you stood before me in this office, a savage in chains."
00:11:03.330,00:11:06.207,"Now you stand as death, made meat and bone."
00:11:08.126,00:11:16.009,"Yet it is upon your shoulders the House of Batiatus has been so elevated, and continues to rise."
00:11:16.134,00:11:23.057,"Two days hence we play host to the most influential in Capua, in celebration of patronage."
00:11:23.183,00:11:27.562,Although a closer look at the Slayer of Theokoles be the true draw.
00:11:27.686,00:11:28.771,A great honor.
00:11:28.896,00:11:30.857,Will the men be displayed in the villa?
00:11:30.982,00:11:33.860,The Legatus would frown upon such storied tradition.
00:11:33.985,00:11:36.237,You and the others will be confined to the square.
00:11:38.072,00:11:39.616,And how will our guests have view?
00:11:39.740,00:11:41.159,From purchase of the balcony.
00:11:41.284,00:11:43.870,No eye will be denied the Champion of Capua!
00:11:43.995,00:11:47.290,As he faces his arch enemy in a match to the death!
00:11:49.792,00:11:51.169,I am to fight Crixus?
00:11:57.091,00:12:01.888,Yet there is no honor in taking the life of a caged lion.
00:12:08.353,00:12:11.730,You truly have fucking mind for this.
00:12:11.856,00:12:14.733,Crixus shall be freed from bond yet only for training.
00:12:14.859,00:12:19.155,"I would not have the animal run free, lest he again bares teeth."
00:12:19.280,00:12:22.617,"Remove yourself to slumber, and dreams of extracting them."
00:12:25.495,00:12:27.038,"Apologies, Dominus."
00:12:27.163,00:12:31.167,There is something I crave more than sleep...
00:12:48.184,00:12:51.396,The gates to the villa must stand open before I make a move on Batiatus.
00:12:51.521,00:12:54.232,You would have me risk all.
00:12:54.357,00:12:56.067,And for what?
00:12:57.694,00:12:59.946,So that Spartacus may have his revenge?
00:13:00.071,00:13:01.656,No.
00:13:10.290,00:13:15.420,"Was she such a woman, your wife."
00:13:20.550,00:13:22.302,Never to rise again.
00:13:22.969,00:13:28.391,"A heavy thing, to be denied its warmth."
00:13:30.184,00:13:32.145,I will see the gate opened.
00:13:34.147,00:13:36.399,But I would have exchange...
00:13:37.400,00:13:39.902,This is my price.
00:13:44.574,00:13:47.744,To know pale shadow of the love that you felt for her...
00:14:54.185,00:14:56.813,I would not have wagered the Gaul such a challenge to Spartacus!
00:14:56.937,00:14:58.231,"You underestimate the man, Aemilia."
00:14:58.356,00:15:01.735,"Crixus was once Champion, was he not?"
00:15:01.860,00:15:03.944,The match is but newly born.
00:15:04.070,00:15:07.198,Much may yet happen as it matures.
00:15:09.325,00:15:11.160,"Apologies, Domina."
00:15:11.285,00:15:13.037,I must gather more wine from the stores.
00:15:13.162,00:15:14.789,Send another.
00:15:14.914,00:15:16.957,"I would keep you close, to attend the guests."
00:15:31.806,00:15:33.433,You must listen to me...
00:15:50.157,00:15:51.868,Dominus has ordered my release?
00:15:51.992,00:15:54.287,It was Spartacus that moved his hand.
00:15:54.412,00:15:56.289,Spartacus?
00:15:56.414,00:15:58.958,He desires you at your best...
00:15:59.083,00:16:02.796,when you stand before him sine missione.
00:16:02.921,00:16:06.048,The gods finally answer my prayers.
00:16:06.173,00:16:08.593,Had they but answered sooner.
00:16:08.718,00:16:12.096,"You stand before him tomorrow, as the sun fades."
00:16:12.221,00:16:16.935,"If it were this very moment, the outcome would not change."
00:16:17.059,00:16:19.312,I have made promise to Naevia.
00:16:30.239,00:16:34.828,"Delay talk of freedom, until there are ears that would welcome the sound."
00:16:34.953,00:16:38.372,I fear Dominus shall forever be deaf to it.
00:16:40.500,00:16:43.252,Place your faith to closer quarters.
00:16:43.377,00:16:49.592,"Dominus releases me from the bonds of servitude, to assume mantle as lanista."
00:16:54.347,00:16:56.891,It is a title well deserved.
00:16:57.016,00:16:59.894,Together we will restore honor to this ludus...
00:17:00.854,00:17:03.189,and Naevia to your arms.
00:17:03.314,00:17:05.232,Spartacus but stands in your way.
00:17:06.734,00:17:08.611,Then he shall fall.
00:17:15.660,00:17:16.870,A celebration?
00:17:16.995,00:17:18.078,Filled with the elite.
00:17:18.204,00:17:20.247,Their deaths will shatter Capua to chaos.
00:17:20.373,00:17:23.334,It'll be days before they regain senses to pursue us.
00:17:23.459,00:17:24.919,Our plan takes form.
00:17:25.044,00:17:26.045,What of Crixus?
00:17:26.170,00:17:28.589,You still must find way to broach subject with the fucking Gaul.
00:17:28.715,00:17:31.968,"It presents itself, as promised."
00:17:33.011,00:17:34.428,Yeah!
00:17:34.554,00:17:35.638,Crixus.
00:17:35.763,00:17:37.306,Crixus.
00:17:37.431,00:17:43.021,Yeah!
00:17:43.145,00:17:45.648,Fuck my ass.
00:17:54.198,00:17:56.283,You have seen task to completion?
00:17:56.409,00:18:02.707,"My husband's patronage has lifted your celebration beyond the heavens, clouds bursting with honored guests."
00:18:04.500,00:18:05.585,They are a necessity...
00:18:05.710,00:18:08.170,"and are delivered, as commanded."
00:18:09.630,00:18:11.674,"Aemilia's husband, Sextus?"
00:18:11.799,00:18:14.468,"He's a former magistrate, yet beloved by many."
00:18:14.594,00:18:17.304,His support would all but secure office.
00:18:17.430,00:18:19.807,Pressing affairs draw him to Rome.
00:18:21.225,00:18:24.270,That does not bring comfort Ilithyia.
00:18:24.395,00:18:27.314,Then perhaps his attendance shall.
00:18:27.440,00:18:31.569,"He will delay travel, with mind towards your celebration."
00:18:31.694,00:18:33.279,How did you turn his attentions?
00:18:33.404,00:18:34.614,He favors me.
00:18:35.448,00:18:37.116,Most husbands do.
00:18:42.496,00:18:46.125,Your services have been deeply appreciated.
00:18:46.250,00:18:47.585,Yet more is needed.
00:18:47.710,00:18:53.173,"In the absence of your honored husband, we would have you address our most noble guests."
00:18:53.299,00:18:59.806,"Just a few words as if fallen from his mouth, extolling the virtues of the House of Batiatus."
00:19:02.058,00:19:04.518,I shall compose something appropriate for the occasion.
00:19:04.644,00:19:05.645,No need.
00:19:05.770,00:19:07.063,I've already seen to it.
00:19:12.401,00:19:17.364,My hands are no longer my own and now you seize my fucking tongue?
00:19:17.490,00:19:21.035,"I would not have it flap about, absent direction."
00:19:21.160,00:19:24.371,How much longer must I suffer your indignities?
00:19:24.497,00:19:26.916,While breath gives life to my command.
00:19:33.297,00:19:36.009,"As you wish, then."
00:19:36.134,00:19:39.720,I know there have been tensions between us.
00:19:39.846,00:19:45.309,Yet I see no cause for our current arrangement to fall into unpleasantness.
00:19:46.686,00:19:49.271,We were such dear friends once.
00:19:50.439,00:19:51.983,Would you not see it so again?
00:19:54.276,00:19:59.573,"Would that I had power to reverse the sun, and restore the world to its proper place."
00:20:23.056,00:20:24.849,Rest.
00:20:24.974,00:20:26.851,Eat.
00:20:26.976,00:20:29.854,We resume after midday sun has past.
00:20:49.957,00:20:52.168,You move well.
00:20:52.292,00:20:55.379,As if lash had never struck.
00:20:55.504,00:20:58.507,"Pain is erased, when inflicted upon others."
00:20:58.632,00:21:00.300,I would have you at your best when we face each other.
00:21:00.426,00:21:02.053,Is that all you'd have from me?
00:21:02.178,00:21:04.513,Rhasko speaks of your desires.
00:21:04.638,00:21:08.226,"What fever grips brain, that Spartacus would think me to band with him?"
00:21:08.350,00:21:10.394,To risk the lives of my men?
00:21:10.519,00:21:11.687,My life?
00:21:11.812,00:21:13.231,Is there one?
00:21:13.355,00:21:15.566,Without the woman you love within it?
00:21:20.905,00:21:23.032,"I know your heart, Crixus."
00:21:23.157,00:21:25.576,I felt the beating of it within my chest once.
00:21:29.122,00:21:30.957,And see Naevia returned to me.
00:21:31.082,00:21:32.708,As my wife was returned?
00:21:34.710,00:21:36.670,Batiatus ordered her death.
00:21:41.675,00:21:43.385,How did you come upon this?
00:21:48.057,00:21:53.854,"I will see the House of Batiatus fall, and with it the villain's blood upon the earth."
00:21:53.980,00:21:56.398,"As would I, in your position."
00:21:56.523,00:21:57.775,But I am far removed.
00:21:57.900,00:21:59.902,My escape would not aid Naevia.
00:22:00.027,00:22:04.531,"How would I purchase her freedom, or even find her, while being hunted like a dog by the Romans?"
00:22:04.657,00:22:09.912,"Join me, and we will find her together."
00:22:15.126,00:22:18.921,"You know that in another life, you and I may have been as brothers."
00:22:22.341,00:22:24.510,But not in this one.
00:22:26.012,00:22:28.764,I must win my freedom in the arena.
00:22:28.889,00:22:31.225,Then we stand in the way of each other's cause.
00:22:31.349,00:22:32.977,And both are just.
00:22:35.771,00:22:42.153,"But if I fall, I'd have you swear to find Naevia and see her freed."
00:22:42.278,00:22:48.366,"And I would have word that if you are victorious, one day you will have Batiatus' life."
00:22:55.373,00:22:56.709,"Tomorrow, then."
00:23:00.713,00:23:02.882,I fear it was always fated so.
00:23:20.691,00:23:22.693,Were you able to procure what we need for tomorrow?
00:23:22.818,00:23:25.571,Good Marcellus was ever helpful.
00:23:26.989,00:23:28.782,Leave us.
00:23:31.660,00:23:33.162,Varro possessed a fine eye.
00:23:33.287,00:23:35.164,Turn yours towards business.
00:23:35.289,00:23:36.874,What has coin extracted from Marcellus?
00:23:36.999,00:23:40.669,A solution to most vexing problem.
00:23:40.794,00:23:43.463,"A few drops in his cup, and fate is sealed."
00:23:43.589,00:23:44.215,It must not kill him.
00:23:44.340,00:23:48.677,"Our guests need to believe the match balanced, lest goodwill turn to accusation."
00:23:48.802,00:23:52.181,"It will but weaken Crixus, allowing Spartacus advantage."
00:23:53.933,00:23:56.560,It is a marvel.
00:23:56.685,00:24:00.273,That something so slight could topple a legend.
00:24:00.398,00:24:01.815,All men fall.
00:24:01.941,00:24:05.069,It is but time and method that differ.
00:24:06.695,00:24:08.614,See it done.
00:24:08.739,00:24:11.992,"And in the act, the end of that fucking Gaul."
00:24:30.010,00:24:32.638,He gives much better showing against Spartacus than the fool Varro.
00:24:32.763,00:24:34.598,Poor Varro.
00:24:34.723,00:24:37.101,"He never stood proper chance, did he?"
00:24:41.230,00:24:45.776,"Crixus, however, threatens to strip the champion of life and title."
00:24:45.901,00:24:47.861,Indeed.
00:24:49.780,00:24:51.991,To the very end.
00:25:11.218,00:25:13.595,Apologies.
00:25:46.586,00:25:50.799,The noble House of Batiatus stands humbled...
00:25:52.134,00:25:55.595,Humbled by the fortunes the gods have seen fit to shower upon us...
00:25:57.973,00:26:00.558,Fortune has but connotation of coin.
00:26:00.684,00:26:02.311,"Blessings, then."
00:26:04.813,00:26:10.944,"Oh, Quintus, has this city yet beheld such a man?"
00:26:14.073,00:26:18.244,"The old bastard would have cracked with jealously, to be so eclipsed by unworthy son."
00:26:19.328,00:26:20.787,"He loved you, Quintus."
00:26:20.913,00:26:22.831,Yet he never believed in me.
00:26:22.956,00:26:27.920,Would that he were alive to see the House of Batiatus soaring beneath the flapping of my wings!
00:26:28.045,00:26:31.715,Our son shall inherit a fucking empire!
00:26:31.840,00:26:33.092,"An empire now, is it?"
00:26:33.217,00:26:34.927,"Eh, the foundations already laid."
00:26:35.052,00:26:36.762,Today we build upon it!
00:26:36.887,00:26:37.930,Spartacus and Crixus!
00:26:38.055,00:26:40.724,"Hated foes, facing each other in death!"
00:26:42.684,00:26:47.064,The whole of the Republic shall whisper with envy what so privileged few bore witness.
00:26:52.694,00:26:56.823,I fear your resolve grows soft.
00:26:56.949,00:26:58.200,Stone.
00:26:59.535,00:27:01.412,I but wish an end to the matter.
00:27:03.163,00:27:06.459,Ashur already attends to it.
00:27:06.584,00:27:10.504,"Turn thoughts from unfortunate past, and fix on glorious future."
00:27:27.271,00:27:30.190,These celebrations can cause hands to tremble.
00:27:34.528,00:27:35.862,Gratitude.
00:27:35.988,00:27:37.281,See nerves calmed.
00:27:37.406,00:27:39.366,You'll do well here.
00:27:39.492,00:27:41.952,I have a feeling of it.
00:27:42.077,00:27:45.539,You are allowed to eat from your master's table?
00:27:45.663,00:27:50.668,"I prepare this as a tribute to the mighty Crixus, before his match against the champion."
00:27:50.794,00:27:52.463,"May the gods bless it, then."
00:27:52.588,00:27:54.632,And give him strength to kill Spartacus.
00:27:58.093,00:28:02.097,I do not believe Spartacus will fall this day.
00:28:04.891,00:28:09.313,"I have heard Crixus bested him once in the arena, at the Vulcanalia."
00:28:09.438,00:28:11.649,What leads you to certainty against similar outcome?
00:28:11.815,00:28:14.860,I am certain of many things within these walls.
00:28:17.112,00:28:19.615,Your beauty among them.
00:28:19.739,00:28:20.866,Aurelia.
00:28:20.991,00:28:22.742,You are needed in the square.
00:29:01.281,00:29:05.661,"Stay to my side Do not stray from it, and I will see you beyond these walls."
00:29:05.785,00:29:07.246,I do not need you to hold hand.
00:29:07.371,00:29:09.831,"I only wish your life protected, you fucking cock!"
00:29:09.956,00:29:12.167,"Speak louder, and see us all undone."
00:29:14.336,00:29:19.592,"Ha, I would have his fucking whip removed, along with the arm that wields it."
00:29:19.717,00:29:22.135,Doctore is an honorable man.
00:29:22.261,00:29:24.263,I would not have him dead.
00:29:25.055,00:29:25.972,Nor any slave.
00:29:26.098,00:29:27.766,You fret of shit and piss.
00:29:31.019,00:29:32.730,They will seize the moment.
00:29:34.189,00:29:36.900,"Crixus is dead, and there stands but one champion."
00:29:46.076,00:29:48.120,Doctore.
00:29:48.245,00:29:49.996,Water?
00:30:08.265,00:30:11.935,These celebrations have habit of turning from control.
00:30:12.060,00:30:16.940,"Should they again, remove to a safe place."
00:30:17.065,00:30:19.276,None exist.
00:30:19.401,00:30:21.695,Not since Varro was taken from me by your hand.
00:30:21.820,00:30:24.864,And I shall forever despise it for the deed.
00:30:24.990,00:30:27.117,In company with the voice that commanded it.
00:30:27.242,00:30:28.744,You blame Batiatus.
00:30:30.162,00:30:31.622,But not this.
00:30:33.707,00:30:41.799,It was the boy Numerius who demanded simple sport end in death.
00:30:41.923,00:30:45.344,And I should believe a man that would do anything to win?
00:30:52.017,00:30:54.060,Do not take me a fool.
00:30:54.186,00:30:59.024,"Ashur prepares meal for Crixus, and speaks of the certainty of your fucking victory."
00:30:59.149,00:31:01.109,They corrupt his food?
00:31:01.234,00:31:02.944,Was it the same for Varro?
00:31:03.069,00:31:05.113,Is that how you bested him?
00:31:08.325,00:31:10.327,I have no hand in this.
00:31:10.452,00:31:18.711,"Were that true, I would still pray Crixus takes your life before he falls."
00:31:37.521,00:31:39.939,You betrayed me.
00:31:47.155,00:31:49.742,You cannot be blamed for being weak.
00:31:51.702,00:31:54.538,"All men are, when faced with wet opportunity."
00:31:57.165,00:31:59.084,I would put it behind us.
00:32:00.627,00:32:02.796,All I ask in return is the truth.
00:32:06.174,00:32:10.637,Tell me Naevia held no meaning for you.
00:32:12.931,00:32:16.184,You ask me to speak with false tongue.
00:32:18.186,00:32:20.522,What would it conjure for our child?
00:32:22.107,00:32:24.526,Seed has at last taken hold.
00:32:28.988,00:32:31.199,You would divine me as father?
00:32:32.451,00:32:33.993,Not Dominus?
00:32:35.203,00:32:38.582,"I feel the blood of a champion, swelling inside me."
00:32:38.707,00:32:40.500,"I feel you, Crixus."
00:32:51.344,00:32:52.888,With Naevia.
00:32:55.808,00:32:58.226,There is nothing left between us.
00:33:07.820,00:33:09.696,Crixus...
00:33:12.365,00:33:15.494,I didn't intend for it to end this way.
00:33:42.020,00:33:43.814,Crixus begins to fade.
00:33:43.939,00:33:45.774,As all memories do.
00:33:53.448,00:33:56.159,You're weakened because they have poisoned you!
00:33:56.284,00:33:57.494,Finish him!
00:33:57.619,00:33:59.329,They wish you dead.
00:34:14.970,00:34:16.638,I would not have this.
00:34:24.396,00:34:26.105,"Join me, brother."
00:34:34.364,00:34:36.575,Kill the dog!
00:34:56.803,00:34:58.722,Spartacus.
00:35:03.560,00:35:05.437,ARGH!
00:35:41.306,00:35:43.058,Kill them!
00:35:43.182,00:35:44.517,Kill them all!
00:35:50.440,00:35:52.525,Do not be alarmed people.
00:35:52.651,00:35:55.528,Everything is under control.
00:35:55.654,00:35:56.780,Please.
00:35:56.905,00:35:57.823,He tried to kill you.
00:35:57.948,00:35:59.116,That fucking animal.
00:35:59.240,00:36:00.617,We must calm this!
00:36:00.742,00:36:02.160,Where are the fucking guards?!
00:36:03.662,00:36:04.830,Why do you stand there?
00:36:04.955,00:36:06.414,Gather your men!
00:36:09.126,00:36:11.586,I shall see you properly attended.
00:36:26.852,00:36:28.728,ARGH!
00:36:42.784,00:36:44.744,Hamilcar!
00:36:57.549,00:36:58.717,Crixus!
00:37:01.970,00:37:04.139,What is this madness?!
00:37:04.263,00:37:05.682,Spartacus shows us the way.
00:37:05.807,00:37:07.475,He is a dog without honor!
00:37:07.600,00:37:09.644,This house is without honor!
00:37:09.769,00:37:11.897,Batiatus ordered his wife dead!
00:37:13.398,00:37:16.818,"She has tainted me, because I spur her fucking heart."
00:37:17.986,00:37:19.905,I have given my life to this ludus!
00:37:20.030,00:37:21.656,"No, they stole it from you."
00:37:21.781,00:37:23.366,From all of us.
00:37:23.491,00:37:25.702,You asked me to put faith in you.
00:37:25.827,00:37:27.370,I ask the same.
00:37:29.039,00:37:32.500,"Honor us all, and see an end of this fucking house."
00:37:42.552,00:37:44.096,Go.
00:38:23.551,00:38:25.762,No!
00:38:39.776,00:38:42.779,"I save you this time, brother..."
00:39:13.601,00:39:14.686,Friends.
00:39:14.811,00:39:17.063,We are perfectly safe inside the villa.
00:39:17.189,00:39:18.523,The situation is being attended!
00:39:18.648,00:39:20.859,Still your hearts.
00:39:20.984,00:39:24.362,This very moment my guards are no doubt dealing with these...
00:39:24.487,00:39:26.114,They've lost mind!
00:39:57.103,00:39:58.938,Come! Let us away!
00:40:02.192,00:40:03.609,Seal the doors.
00:40:03.735,00:40:04.485,Let no one beyond them.
00:40:04.610,00:40:05.695,What of the guests?
00:40:05.820,00:40:07.488,I am the wife of the Legatus.
00:40:07.613,00:40:09.991,Seal the fucking doors!
00:40:16.539,00:40:18.541,Ilithyia!
00:40:27.800,00:40:29.802,Open the doors!
00:40:49.739,00:40:51.657,Do you recall what I said?
00:40:51.783,00:40:54.119,In this very room?
00:40:54.244,00:41:00.041,"That if there was more to Barca's departure, you and I would share words."
00:41:03.711,00:41:04.837,Doctore...
00:41:04.963,00:41:08.133,Do not fucking speak.
00:41:08.258,00:41:12.262,"I have seen you ply tongue upon ear, whispering poison."
00:41:12.387,00:41:14.847,Infecting the honor of this house.
00:41:14.973,00:41:17.683,You would kill a defenseless man?
00:41:17.809,00:41:20.145,Where is the fucking honor in that?
00:41:22.772,00:41:24.232,When you were yet a man.
00:41:30.613,00:41:32.324,The doors...
00:41:32.449,00:41:34.242,The doors...
00:41:35.243,00:41:36.786,Glaber's men...
00:41:36.911,00:41:38.204,sealed the doors...
00:41:38.330,00:41:39.372,Ilithyia.
00:41:40.915,00:41:42.083,Mother!
00:41:54.804,00:41:56.722,Quintus...
00:41:56.848,00:41:58.516,Go!
00:41:58.641,00:42:00.059,Come.
00:42:03.813,00:42:06.065,Come here you Roman pussies.
00:42:07.608,00:42:08.526,We are all of us dead.
00:42:08.651,00:42:10.820,No. We will regain this House.
00:42:12.489,00:42:14.240,"Take Numerius, conceal yourselves."
00:42:14.366,00:42:15.408,Come.
00:42:15.533,00:42:16.784,I know a place.
00:42:16.909,00:42:18.870,Where do you go?
00:42:18.995,00:42:20.830,To my husband.
00:42:23.291,00:42:25.126,And the death of Spartacus.
00:42:33.426,00:42:34.802,Pathetic.
00:42:34.927,00:42:38.014,You think this will cause difference?
00:42:45.688,00:42:48.441,It plotted the death of Barca.
00:42:48.607,00:42:50.818,Saw the Magistrate's end.
00:42:50.943,00:42:54.697,It even helped force Glaber to patronage.
00:42:54.822,00:43:03.206,"Every beam, every stone in this fucking house bears the mark of Ashur!"
00:43:03.331,00:43:05.542,It bears only your treachery.
00:43:08.336,00:43:11.756,My fucking treachery?
00:43:11.881,00:43:16.761,When did you stand forth for Ashur?
00:43:18.012,00:43:27.480,"When did any of you greet me short of mockery and scorn, fucking cunts!"
00:43:31.401,00:43:33.403,You received what you deserved!
00:43:33.528,00:43:38.241,"For Barca and all the others that you have betrayed, your time is done."
00:43:48.960,00:43:51.212,Would that this were the arena.
00:43:51.337,00:43:54.340,Your blood would dishonor the sand.
00:43:56.509,00:43:58.052,"Send me on my way, then."
00:43:59.137,00:44:01.264,As you would a Gladiator.
00:44:04.100,00:44:06.018,"Please, Doctore."
00:44:07.562,00:44:09.522,A parting kindness...
00:44:33.004,00:44:34.713,Ashur!
00:44:36.424,00:44:38.217,Ashur!
00:45:14.045,00:45:15.712,Quintus...
00:45:17.215,00:45:18.466,Quintus?
00:45:19.300,00:45:21.260,You were right.
00:45:25.515,00:45:28.393,There is still something between you and I.
00:45:30.853,00:45:32.271,Where is Naevia?
00:45:35.024,00:45:36.609,Where?!
00:45:39.320,00:45:42.823,See me and the Dominus out of the villa and I will tell you.
00:45:46.911,00:45:48.329,I do not believe you.
00:45:49.539,00:45:51.790,Please...
00:45:51.916,00:45:53.292,Crixus...
00:45:56.753,00:45:58.464,our child...
00:46:03.261,00:46:10.059,"I would rather see it dead, than suckle your breast."
00:46:40.089,00:46:41.716,We must conceal ourselves...
00:46:52.268,00:46:54.395,Was it yours?
00:46:54.520,00:46:57.064,"That small, little voice."
00:46:59.734,00:47:02.487,Did it form the words that robbed Varro of his life?
00:47:02.612,00:47:04.029,Varro?!
00:47:05.740,00:47:08.159,He deserved to die!
00:47:14.123,00:47:16.125,What did you know of the man?
00:47:16.250,00:47:24.133,"That he would sing to his child, sleeping in his arms?"
00:47:24.258,00:47:28.346,"Or kiss the tears from my cheek, when I was of a mood?"
00:47:30.306,00:47:31.766,Did you know the father?
00:47:33.058,00:47:35.102,The husband?
00:47:41.693,00:47:44.111,He was not a perfect man.
00:47:48.157,00:47:49.866,But he was mine.
00:47:51.828,00:47:53.371,He was mine!
00:47:53.496,00:47:54.871,He was mine!
00:47:54.997,00:47:55.790,Yaaa!
00:47:57.041,00:47:59.794,Mine!
00:47:59.918,00:48:01.170,Ahhh!
00:48:03.798,00:48:06.384,He was mine.
00:48:06.509,00:48:07.926,Yaaa!
00:48:08.469,00:48:09.512,Mine...
00:48:09.637,00:48:11.222,Aurelia...
00:48:12.807,00:48:14.600,Be still.
00:48:15.226,00:48:17.269,It's done.
00:48:29.990,00:48:31.950,Look to the girl.
00:48:32.076,00:48:34.161,Is this not enough?
00:48:34.286,00:48:36.121,How many more must die?
00:48:36.247,00:48:37.832,I would see but one.
00:48:41.419,00:48:43.546,I am your Dominus!
00:48:43.671,00:48:45.631,I will have your fucking hearts!
00:48:48.300,00:48:50.469,Quintus...
00:48:56.726,00:48:58.519,Lucretia!
00:49:00.271,00:49:03.107,What would you do?
00:49:03.232,00:49:05.192,To hold your wife again?
00:49:07.027,00:49:08.905,To feel the warmth of her skin?
00:49:10.489,00:49:13.033,The taste of her lips?
00:49:13.158,00:49:15.160,How many men would you kill?
00:49:15.745,00:49:17.079,A hundred?
00:49:18.038,00:49:19.707,A thousand?
00:49:19.832,00:49:23.294,"There stands but one, between you and her."
00:49:32.386,00:49:34.430,Go to her.
00:49:36.724,00:49:41.896,Tell her the gods themselves would not keep you apart.
00:49:42.313,00:49:43.898,Lie!
00:49:46.233,00:49:48.402,As you lied to me of my wife.
00:49:51.363,00:49:52.907,Oenemaus...
00:50:03.292,00:50:06.128,You were nothing before me!
00:50:07.212,00:50:09.089,I gave you everything!
00:50:09.214,00:50:12.510,I gave you the means to accept your fate!
00:50:17.306,00:50:19.767,And now you are destroyed by it.
00:51:00.683,00:51:03.811,I have done this thing because it is just.
00:51:05.061,00:51:07.439,Blood demands blood.
00:51:11.443,00:51:17.575,"We have lived and lost, at the whims of our masters for too long."
00:51:19.577,00:51:21.620,I would not have it so.
00:51:25.041,00:51:31.213,I would not see the passing of a brother for the purpose of sport.
00:51:31.338,00:51:37.845,"I would not see another heart ripped from chest, or breath forfeit for no cause."
00:51:40.056,00:51:42.058,I know not all of you wished this.
00:51:44.100,00:51:45.937,Yet it is done.
00:51:47.521,00:51:49.648,It is done.
00:51:50.733,00:51:52.693,Your lives are your own.
00:51:52.818,00:51:54.904,Forge your own path...
00:51:55.029,00:52:01.535,"or join with us, and together we shall see Rome tremble."
00:00:56.306,00:01:00.561,"Ah, ah, that was..."
00:01:01.520,00:01:03.772,vigorous.
00:01:04.899,00:01:08.109,You look like the sort of man that could handle it.
00:01:08.235,00:01:09.987,I am rather rugged...
00:01:15.034,00:01:17.036,Must go.
00:01:17.160,00:01:18.829,Father will be worried.
00:01:18.954,00:01:20.205,As well he should be...
00:01:21.749,00:01:23.918,I have to go.
00:01:24.043,00:01:28.047,"If you do, my heart will break."
00:01:30.215,00:01:31.675,Ask me to stay.
00:01:31.800,00:01:33.719,Stay.
00:01:35.094,00:01:37.014,Ask me.
00:01:37.138,00:01:38.640,By my name.
00:01:42.310,00:01:45.146,"You do not even know it, do you?"
00:01:46.273,00:01:49.484,Sura.
00:01:49.610,00:01:51.319,My name is Sura.
00:01:51.445,00:01:52.988,Sura.
00:01:54.197,00:01:56.533,As beautiful as the woman herself.
00:01:57.409,00:01:58.159,My name is..
00:01:58.285,00:02:01.121,Every woman knows who you are.
00:02:01.246,00:02:03.665,And to avoid you.
00:02:06.668,00:02:08.462,"Huh, the worst."
00:02:11.381,00:02:14.342,Then why lay with a man of such ill reputation?
00:02:14.468,00:02:16.261,The gods led me to your bed.
00:02:18.263,00:02:20.599,The gods?
00:02:20.724,00:02:21.725,They come to me.
00:02:21.850,00:02:23.811,In my dreams.
00:02:23.936,00:02:26.730,They showed me the man you could become.
00:02:29.274,00:02:31.276,If set upon the right path.
00:02:31.401,00:02:36.239,And what else did the gods tell you about my future?
00:02:36.364,00:02:39.618,That you will never love another woman.
00:04:56.088,00:04:58.173,The heart weighs heavy.
00:04:58.298,00:05:00.675,So much hope in reunion.
00:05:00.801,00:05:02.677,To come to such bitter end...
00:05:02.803,00:05:04.096,How is it so?
00:05:05.889,00:05:07.390,The fault is mine.
00:05:09.851,00:05:11.394,The road from Neapolis is known to be treacherous.
00:05:11.519,00:05:12.938,I should have doubled the guard.
00:05:13.063,00:05:14.815,Tripled it.
00:05:14.940,00:05:17.692,I should have delayed giving Barca his freedom and sent him along as well.
00:05:20.654,00:05:22.739,Pray the gods forgive my error.
00:05:22.864,00:05:24.616,No.
00:05:24.741,00:05:26.201,You kept your word.
00:05:26.326,00:05:29.746,The fault lies with the men who took her life.
00:05:29.871,00:05:34.417,"And with Claudius Glaber, who condemned her to slavery."
00:05:36.170,00:05:38.546,There is nothing to be done to change what has passed.
00:05:38.672,00:05:41.382,We must look towards the future.
00:05:41.508,00:05:44.469,You are the Bringer of Rain.
00:05:44.594,00:05:46.429,The Slayer of Death.
00:05:46.554,00:05:52.019,Together we will etch the name Spartacus to the pillars of history.
00:05:56.231,00:05:58.108,Spartacus.
00:06:01.111,00:06:03.197,That is not my name.
00:06:03.322,00:06:05.740,It is now.
00:06:14.541,00:06:19.338,Nearly a year you had me searching for that Thracian woman.
00:06:19.462,00:06:22.381,Why have me take her life short of the mark?
00:06:22.507,00:06:24.134,An unfortunate necessity.
00:06:24.259,00:06:25.719,I trust the sum sufficient?
00:06:27.054,00:06:32.391,"If other necessities arise, consider me your man."
00:06:37.814,00:06:41.568,"So great an expense, to have her delivered all but dead."
00:06:45.530,00:06:46.907,She was his life.
00:06:47.032,00:06:49.117,The heart beating beneath his chest.
00:06:49.243,00:06:50.409,No.
00:06:50.535,00:06:55.165,"Such a man would not believe she was gone, unless his own eyes told him it was so."
00:06:55.290,00:06:57.292,It was the only course.
00:06:57.416,00:07:01.296,And one which you could have told me you were undertaking.
00:07:01.420,00:07:05.217,"I would keep such blood from these hands, as I have said."
00:07:05.342,00:07:07.594,They hold yours.
00:07:07.719,00:07:09.846,Are they not stained by the touch?
00:07:09.971,00:07:12.307,There has been too much death of late.
00:07:12.432,00:07:14.809,I would turn towards more respectable ventures.
00:07:16.103,00:07:23.193,"With his wife removed from thought, I will mold Spartacus into a gladiator the likes of which the world has never seen."
00:07:23.318,00:07:24.945,He has already defeated Theokoles.
00:07:25.070,00:07:28.990,Imagine what he will accomplish once his mind has been focused on nothing but victory.
00:07:29.116,00:07:32.786,You will be the greatest lanista in the Republic.
00:07:32.911,00:07:36.123,And on such a title we will climb beyond our station.
00:07:36.248,00:07:38.499,Beyond Capua.
00:07:38.625,00:07:43.671,Perhaps to the very steps of the senate itself.
00:07:57.978,00:07:59.854,The fever still grips him?
00:08:02.732,00:08:05.526,I would know if his condition changes.
00:08:18.373,00:08:20.250,"A word, Doctore."
00:08:20.375,00:08:23.128,Pietros.
00:08:23.253,00:08:25.130,"The birds, left in Barca's cell."
00:08:25.255,00:08:26.923,What should I do with them?
00:08:27.048,00:08:28.258,Whatever you wish.
00:08:28.383,00:08:29.509,He said we would release them.
00:08:29.634,00:08:31.886,Once he gained our freedom.
00:08:33.721,00:08:37.225,That was his purpose in speaking with our Dominus.
00:08:37.351,00:08:39.936,Ashur said the price was too steep for us both.
00:08:40.061,00:08:40.937,Ashur?
00:08:41.062,00:08:43.690,He helped negotiate the sum.
00:08:45.775,00:08:47.486,The birds?
00:08:49.237,00:08:51.406,It would not cause notice.
00:08:51.531,00:08:53.616,Thank you.
00:09:45.960,00:09:47.546,That is unwise.
00:09:51.425,00:09:53.593,If the guards were to see you with it...
00:09:54.886,00:09:58.098,"What could they do to me, that hasn't already been done?"
00:09:59.433,00:10:01.184,I never should have left her.
00:10:01.309,00:10:03.437,You did not leave her.
00:10:03.562,00:10:05.313,She was taken from you.
00:10:05.439,00:10:08.233,Before I left for war.
00:10:08.358,00:10:09.650,She asked me not to go.
00:10:09.776,00:10:12.446,You did what you thought was right.
00:10:12.571,00:10:13.905,To protect her.
00:10:15.782,00:10:17.742,You should toss that over the cliff.
00:10:19.286,00:10:21.913,Best to be done with such thoughts.
00:10:34.426,00:10:37.095,"Careful with that, It costs more than your worth."
00:10:37.220,00:10:41.349,It won't be long until our house is finally livable again.
00:10:43.393,00:10:44.394,We aim at the heavens!
00:10:44.519,00:10:46.396,The Palace of Batiatus!
00:10:46.521,00:10:49.608,Where dignitaries kneel to suck the cock of my good fortune!
00:10:49.732,00:10:51.526,"Well, they'll have to get in line..."
00:10:56.281,00:10:57.657,Crixus?
00:11:08.376,00:11:10.295,Lie still!
00:11:10.420,00:11:12.088,Best to heed the advice.
00:11:12.213,00:11:13.714,For a while we thought you for the afterlife.
00:11:13.840,00:11:15.758,When will I fight again.
00:11:18.386,00:11:23.475,"Worry of nothing but recovery, the crowd will once again cheer the name Crixus."
00:11:23.600,00:11:25.143,A word.
00:11:29.939,00:11:33.692,It would be improper for me to visit you in the ludus.
00:11:33.818,00:11:36.571,But know that my thoughts are with you.
00:11:36.695,00:11:40.074,I'll send my slave Naevia often to attend your needs.
00:11:40.200,00:11:41.951,Rest now.
00:11:43.161,00:11:45.746,And worry for nothing.
00:12:14.317,00:12:17.404,"Your swords for practice, Champion."
00:12:27.664,00:12:30.291,The day's training begins.
00:12:30.417,00:12:32.168,Pair up!
00:12:32.293,00:12:34.128,Sword and shield!
00:12:37.382,00:12:39.259,You face me.
00:12:49.977,00:12:51.730,Your wife's passing.
00:12:51.854,00:12:54.357,That was an unfortunate thing.
00:12:54.482,00:12:56.401,As was your plan for escape.
00:12:58.319,00:13:00.113,I have not tasted wine for many years.
00:13:00.238,00:13:02.865,Yet a single cup would not rob me of my senses.
00:13:02.990,00:13:05.826,The choice was to see you sleep...
00:13:05.952,00:13:08.455,Or never awaken.
00:13:22.385,00:13:24.387,Your victory over Theokoles...
00:13:24.512,00:13:27.390,is the only reason Batiatus does not know of your treachery.
00:13:27.515,00:13:31.018,"Champion or no, you would be crucified."
00:13:31.144,00:13:33.730,Then part your lips and see it done!
00:13:39.152,00:13:40.779,Next time you seek escape...
00:13:57.504,00:14:00.298,"Make it half, yeah?"
00:14:00.423,00:14:01.800,Good Mercato!
00:14:01.924,00:14:03.343,You must excuse the chaos!
00:14:03.468,00:14:06.053,I had hoped to see such affairs completed before your arrival.
00:14:06.179,00:14:07.555,Fortune favors you.
00:14:07.681,00:14:10.809,"As it does all of Capua, since the rains!"
00:14:10.933,00:14:12.811,My time is pressed.
00:14:12.935,00:14:13.603,"Ah, to the matter then."
00:14:13.728,00:14:18.817,"I secured six of your men for my games, honoring the storied history of my family."
00:14:18.941,00:14:21.902,"Arrangements made before the Vulcanalia, if you recall."
00:14:22.028,00:14:22.945,As if it were yesterday.
00:14:23.070,00:14:29.910,"Well, I've decided as highlight to reenact Rome's victory over the Maedi, the Thracian tribe who dared invade Macedonia."
00:14:30.036,00:14:34.332,"They were slaughtered for their insolence by my grandfather, Marcus Minucius Rufus."
00:14:34.457,00:14:37.377,"A name that carries weight, long after it's passing!"
00:14:37.502,00:14:41.464,"I'd planned for to play the very man himself, leading the charge."
00:14:41.589,00:14:42.382,Apologies.
00:14:42.507,00:14:45.009,Crixus is yet recovering from his battle with Theokoles.
00:14:45.134,00:14:47.178,Ah. As I suspected.
00:14:47.303,00:14:48.388,"Perhaps Gnaeus, then?"
00:14:48.513,00:14:51.850,I turn thought towards Spartacus.
00:14:53.017,00:14:54.477,He is much in demand.
00:14:54.602,00:14:55.645,The cost of such a thing?
00:14:55.770,00:14:57.355,An additional forty percent.
00:14:57.480,00:14:59.148,Prisoners to play the Thracians included?
00:15:00.900,00:15:03.361,I will see it announced all over Capua!
00:15:03.486,00:15:06.740,"Spartacus, Slayer of Theokoles!"
00:15:06.865,00:15:09.534,To assume the mantle of my grandfather!
00:15:09.659,00:15:12.161,A great day!
00:15:18.084,00:15:19.836,Pietros.
00:15:19.960,00:15:21.880,Bring more water.
00:15:23.673,00:15:25.592,Now.
00:15:27.677,00:15:29.679,Fucking pig.
00:15:29.804,00:15:30.930,The way he paws at the boy...
00:15:31.055,00:15:33.725,The fault lies with Barca.
00:15:33.850,00:15:35.643,For leaving him.
00:15:36.519,00:15:38.062,Is it delivered?
00:15:38.187,00:15:39.606,As promised.
00:15:41.649,00:15:44.652,A letter to my wife.
00:15:48.197,00:15:49.616,Yeah.
00:15:49.741,00:15:51.409,Did you bring reply?
00:15:53.787,00:15:56.790,She insisted on bringing you message herself.
00:16:25.443,00:16:27.278,How did you gain entry?
00:16:27.403,00:16:30.698,Your man Ashur spoke to Batiatus on my behalf.
00:16:30.824,00:16:32.617,Did he ask coin for the service?
00:16:32.742,00:16:35.161,He said he would take the matter up with you.
00:16:36.996,00:16:40.291,"Who cares of coin on such a day, eh?"
00:16:43.503,00:16:45.379,The boy has grown monstrous!
00:16:48.883,00:16:51.970,And his mother ever more beautiful...
00:17:05.316,00:17:07.234,Every day I prayed for word.
00:17:07.360,00:17:10.196,And that it would not be news of your death in the arena.
00:17:10.321,00:17:12.824,"We agreed no letters, Aurelia."
00:17:16.953,00:17:19.455,And my mind on the task.
00:17:19.580,00:17:21.624,And what has changed?
00:17:21.749,00:17:23.501,A friend.
00:17:23.626,00:17:25.586,His loss.
00:17:25.712,00:17:28.006,A friend.
00:17:28.130,00:17:30.008,You are moved by a friend.
00:17:30.132,00:17:34.261,I am moved by the need to see my wife.
00:17:34.387,00:17:39.475,"To know she is still real, and not the dream of a desperate man."
00:17:39.600,00:17:42.687,After one more year my debts will be paid.
00:17:42.812,00:17:43.897,We can start again.
00:17:44.022,00:17:46.106,"All of us, together."
00:17:46.232,00:17:47.650,We should have just left.
00:17:47.775,00:17:49.694,To Pompeii. Or Sicilia.
00:17:49.819,00:17:51.153,It would not have been honorable.
00:17:51.278,00:17:53.656,Honor?
00:17:53.781,00:17:57.117,Where is the honor in debts of gambling and chance?
00:17:57.243,00:18:00.287,Where is the honor in leaving your wife and child?
00:18:01.956,00:18:03.416,Every mistake I have made...
00:18:03.541,00:18:05.167,I will set right.
00:18:05.292,00:18:08.796,I will be the man you deserve.
00:18:08.922,00:18:16.846,"From this moment on my life is yours, and yours alone."
00:18:16.971,00:18:18.932,I am with child.
00:18:19.057,00:18:20.641,Child?
00:18:25.939,00:18:27.648,What is your meaning?
00:18:27.774,00:18:28.691,Varro..
00:18:28.816,00:18:30.484,Your meaning.
00:18:30.610,00:18:32.695,Your absence has been difficult.
00:18:37.116,00:18:39.994,Titus offered assistance.
00:18:40.119,00:18:41.746,Titus?
00:18:41.871,00:18:44.290,"An acquaintance, from the marketplace."
00:18:44.415,00:18:46.793,And you repay him by spreading your fucking legs?!
00:18:46.918,00:18:49.378,No. I thought of him only as a friend.
00:18:49.503,00:18:51.047,He forced himself upon me.
00:18:51.171,00:18:52.172,Why didn't you stop him?
00:18:52.298,00:18:55.927,You think I wanted this?
00:18:56.052,00:18:58.054,"Where were you, Varro?"
00:18:58.178,00:19:00.139,Where the fuck were you?
00:19:02.558,00:19:04.978,Fighting.
00:19:05.103,00:19:07.187,For us.
00:19:07.313,00:19:09.189,As you should have been.
00:19:25.123,00:19:28.417,The House of Batiatus is filled with champions.
00:19:28.542,00:19:30.461,Father's.
00:19:30.586,00:19:32.212,Grandfather's.
00:19:32.338,00:19:34.841,Soon you will stand among them.
00:19:34.966,00:19:37.718,"I have commissioned you to be immortalized in stone, at great expense."
00:19:37.844,00:19:38.845,"You honor me, Dominus."
00:19:38.970,00:19:40.346,Well the laurels do not cease there.
00:19:40.471,00:19:45.018,Good Mercato has insisted that Spartacus be moved to the forefront of his games!
00:19:45.143,00:19:49.772,"You will take the guise of his storied grandfather, Marcus Minucius Rufus!"
00:19:49.897,00:19:50.731,Rufus?
00:19:50.857,00:19:53.526,You know of him?
00:19:53.651,00:19:57.321,"I have heard the name, spoken by my father when I was a boy."
00:19:57.446,00:20:02.576,"You will be dressed in his very armor, four of our gladiators bedecked as Roman Legion."
00:20:02.702,00:20:04.704,Our enemy?
00:20:04.829,00:20:09.792,"Six prisoners sentenced to execution, clad in the barbaric fashion of the Thracian hordes of the Maedi!"
00:20:09.917,00:20:13.921,"It will be a grand spectacle, with you its shining helm!"
00:20:15.173,00:20:16.465,I will not fight.
00:20:16.590,00:20:18.676,You misunderstand.
00:20:20.427,00:20:21.888,I command.
00:20:22.013,00:20:26.559,I will not dress as a Roman and pretend to slaughter my own people.
00:20:26.684,00:20:28.644,It is time for you to release your hold upon past.
00:20:28.769,00:20:30.771,You are no longer of Thrace.
00:20:32.732,00:20:36.443,"You are destined for great and wonderful things, Spartacus."
00:20:38.112,00:20:41.240,Embrace the path the gods have set you upon.
00:20:42.282,00:20:44.744,Your mind is clouded by grief.
00:20:44.869,00:20:46.370,Pause to clear it.
00:20:57.590,00:20:59.967,You bathe me as if a child.
00:21:03.054,00:21:05.389,Lay still.
00:21:05.514,00:21:07.641,You'll reopen your wounds.
00:21:10.352,00:21:12.980,I can't even rise.
00:21:13.106,00:21:14.314,In time.
00:21:15.524,00:21:17.818,Always the enemy of a gladiator.
00:21:17.944,00:21:20.571,Yet friend to us now.
00:21:20.696,00:21:24.242,Domina has given excuse for us to be together.
00:21:24.366,00:21:27.369,Let us pluck blessing from misfortune.
00:21:30.998,00:21:35.377,"Crixus, You live."
00:21:35.502,00:21:38.005,"My prayers, answered."
00:21:38.131,00:21:41.050,"I would have more prayers, to return me to the sand to be by the men."
00:21:41.175,00:21:43.636,You shall rejoin your brothers soon enough.
00:21:43.761,00:21:45.846,Brothers?
00:21:45.972,00:21:48.057,None have visited me.
00:21:48.182,00:21:50.226,Not even Barca.
00:21:51.978,00:21:52.979,Have you not told him?
00:21:54.730,00:21:56.899,"Has he fallen, in the arena?"
00:21:57.024,00:21:58.859,Far the opposite.
00:21:58.985,00:22:01.403,He has purchased his freedom.
00:22:03.156,00:22:04.657,The Beast of Carthage?
00:22:04.782,00:22:06.784,What is Barca if not a gladiator?
00:22:11.038,00:22:12.748,The thought is foreign.
00:22:12.873,00:22:16.961,The giant fuck tending goats and picking vegetables?
00:22:17.086,00:22:20.422,With Pietros his ever doting wife?
00:22:20.547,00:22:21.841,He left the boy.
00:22:21.966,00:22:24.718,He'd sooner part with his own cock!
00:22:24.844,00:22:27.471,The news found me surprised also.
00:22:27.596,00:22:32.643,"He did not wish it, but had no choice."
00:22:32.768,00:22:35.437,You shared words with him?
00:22:35.562,00:22:42.486,"No, but I saw it in his eyes, as he was escorted through the gates."
00:22:43.529,00:22:45.323,You were there?
00:22:52.872,00:22:55.499,I would see you with a sword in hand soon.
00:23:02.173,00:23:04.591,Barca gone.
00:23:08.512,00:23:11.389,I have awoken to a world of shit.
00:23:21.859,00:23:25.279,You are a fool to refuse Batiatus.
00:23:25.403,00:23:27.698,The man makes unreasonable demands.
00:23:27.823,00:23:29.867,He is your master.
00:23:29.992,00:23:33.079,"His demands your duty, unreasonable or otherwise."
00:23:33.204,00:23:34.955,I will not be forced to slaughter my countrymen.
00:23:35.081,00:23:36.249,Countrymen in dress only.
00:23:36.374,00:23:38.209,You share no kinship with these prisoners.
00:23:38.334,00:23:39.417,They are murderers.
00:23:39.543,00:23:40.502,Rapists.
00:23:40.627,00:23:42.171,Their death well deserved.
00:23:42.296,00:23:45.091,Then let another man's blade grant it.
00:23:45.216,00:23:46.759,You act as if you have free will in the matter.
00:23:46.884,00:23:48.219,You are a gladiator.
00:23:48.344,00:23:49.553,I am a Thracian.
00:23:49.678,00:23:52.056,You are a slave.
00:23:52.181,00:23:56.685,To cling to a life beyond these walls is to see your heart parted from your chest.
00:23:56.810,00:23:58.645,You above all others should know this.
00:24:06.028,00:24:08.239,I do not think before I speak.
00:24:10.699,00:24:13.451,I will remove myself to less deserving company.
00:24:33.347,00:24:35.433,Pietros.
00:24:41.439,00:24:43.316,Gnaeus' hand?
00:24:45.692,00:24:47.236,To what end?
00:24:50.239,00:24:54.701,"Will it see us reunited, or free, as he promised?"
00:24:58.872,00:24:59.957,To his regret.
00:25:00.082,00:25:02.876,Felt more keenly by the one left behind.
00:25:05.587,00:25:08.924,Rome is positively aflutter with news of Theokoles' defeat.
00:25:09.049,00:25:10.592,No one could believe such a thing was possible.
00:25:10.717,00:25:13.387,Especially at the hands of a Thracian.
00:25:13.511,00:25:17.224,The gods truly bless the House of Batiatus.
00:25:17.350,00:25:21.854,"We've even entertaining thoughts of a patron, to share in our good fortune."
00:25:21.979,00:25:22.980,Hm.
00:25:23.105,00:25:25.316,And does your good fortune extend downward?
00:25:26.066,00:25:27.860,I don't follow.
00:25:27.985,00:25:29.028,The Priestess.
00:25:29.153,00:25:32.990,Has her fertility rite born any seed?
00:25:33.115,00:25:36.785,I was unable to conclude the rite in the allotted time.
00:25:36.910,00:25:37.535,No!
00:25:37.661,00:25:39.288,Well my husband was sadly absent.
00:25:39.413,00:25:40.498,What of the other man?
00:25:40.622,00:25:44.168,Oh. You still have not told me anything about him.
00:25:44.293,00:25:45.627,Is it Solonius?
00:25:45.752,00:25:47.587,I would rather fuck an eel.
00:25:54.470,00:25:57.056,Someone of position maybe...?
00:25:57.181,00:25:58.098,He's no one of note.
00:25:58.224,00:26:00.476,No one of note...
00:26:00.600,00:26:02.686,"Someone more physical, perhaps."
00:26:03.979,00:26:05.189,"Oh, your cups empty."
00:26:05.314,00:26:07.066,...isn't it?
00:26:07.191,00:26:09.235,"But not just any slave, no not for you."
00:26:09.360,00:26:12.154,He would have to be forged by Jupiter himself...
00:26:12.279,00:26:14.781,Let us move on from the subject.
00:26:14.907,00:26:16.992,Of course.
00:26:20.538,00:26:25.334,How fares Crixus?
00:26:25.459,00:26:26.419,Crixus?
00:26:26.544,00:26:29.338,"His injuries, suffered against Theokoles."
00:26:29.463,00:26:31.298,Is he expected to live?
00:26:33.217,00:26:34.676,Joyous news.
00:26:34.801,00:26:42.059,"It would be a great tragedy to see such a man pass from this world, would it not?"
00:26:42.184,00:26:43.643,It would.
00:26:43.769,00:26:46.813,Pity he will not take the sand in good Mercato's games.
00:26:46.939,00:26:50.234,I long to see his sword thrust home.
00:26:58.325,00:27:00.911,The game of dice and bones.
00:27:02.662,00:27:06.083,"Poorly, as I often have."
00:27:06.208,00:27:08.461,I will balance the loss at next chance..
00:27:11.422,00:27:15.050,It would seem Pietros has lost control of his flock.
00:27:26.437,00:27:28.063,Pietros..
00:27:35.988,00:27:38.656,The boy has freed himself.
00:28:08.145,00:28:09.605,Enough!
00:28:13.651,00:28:15.735,What is this foolishness?
00:28:19.281,00:28:21.450,Pietros.
00:28:21.575,00:28:23.743,The boy took his own life.
00:28:29.208,00:28:32.252,He will be missed...
00:28:32.378,00:28:35.631,Especially his lips around my cock.
00:29:00.989,00:29:04.784,This morning I boasted the top Retiarius in all of Capua!
00:29:04.910,00:29:09.707,Now I possess nothing more than bones and brains scattered upon the rocks!
00:29:09.831,00:29:10.999,Apologies.
00:29:11.124,00:29:14.127,Fuck your apologies!
00:29:14.253,00:29:17.381,I will have return of the value lost!
00:29:17.506,00:29:21.343,The price of the man will be subtracted from your winnings until the remainder is balanced!
00:29:21.468,00:29:23.262,"As you see fit, Dominus."
00:29:25.514,00:29:26.181,Pietros?
00:29:26.306,00:29:28.892,He was nothing.
00:29:29.017,00:29:31.395,He was a man.
00:29:33.272,00:29:36.191,Gnaeus was a gladiator!
00:29:36.316,00:29:40.153,"Years of training, each mounting to exorbitant cost."
00:29:40.279,00:29:42.822,That is true worth!
00:29:42.948,00:29:44.908,He did not deserve to live.
00:29:46.535,00:29:48.370,I alone decides who live!
00:29:48.495,00:29:51.164,Not you! Not a fucking slave!
00:29:52.583,00:29:54.918,Argh!
00:29:57.337,00:30:02.509,"My generosity has been boundless, yet you defy me still."
00:30:04.344,00:30:07.306,Mercato's games are upon us.
00:30:18.858,00:30:20.527,See him to the Medicus.
00:30:36.293,00:30:39.045,You shed tears for the boy?
00:30:39.171,00:30:40.422,His passing saddens me.
00:30:40.547,00:30:43.049,He was too weak for this place.
00:30:43.175,00:30:46.720,Without Barca to protect him.
00:30:46.845,00:30:49.515,Not all of us can be strong.
00:31:04.154,00:31:07.282,Have you been making friends again?
00:31:07.407,00:31:09.535,Gnaeus.
00:31:09.660,00:31:10.410,A disagreement.
00:31:10.536,00:31:13.330,And you emerged the battered cunt.
00:31:13.455,00:31:16.041,"What, did his tiny net prove too fierce an opponent?"
00:31:16.166,00:31:18.210,For the slayer of Theokoles?
00:31:18.335,00:31:20.253,Ask the man himself.
00:31:20.379,00:31:23.089,If you can scrape enough of him off the cliff for reply.
00:31:23.215,00:31:25.342,Gnaeus is dead?
00:31:25.467,00:31:29.638,What reason did you have to take his life?
00:31:29.763,00:31:32.098,My reasoning lies forever silent.
00:31:36.687,00:31:38.230,Gnaeus was a gladiator!
00:31:38.355,00:31:39.231,A brother.
00:31:42.484,00:31:48.407,"Every man in here became your brother, deservide of an honorable death in the arena."
00:31:48.532,00:31:51.910,Your actions shame my fighting beside you.
00:31:54.663,00:31:59.459,I did and I chose not to end your life in the arena.
00:31:59.585,00:32:05.549,A decision I presently regret.
00:32:05.674,00:32:07.133,As do I.
00:32:20.021,00:32:22.982,You knew Pietros well?
00:32:23.108,00:32:23.983,Only in passing.
00:32:24.109,00:32:26.904,Yet you tend to his pets.
00:32:27.028,00:32:28.071,A duty not required.
00:32:28.196,00:32:29.989,A foolish gesture.
00:32:34.160,00:32:41.376,"It surprises, that Barca would claim his freedom at yet leave the things he loved in captivity."
00:32:48.884,00:32:50.761,No.
00:32:52.846,00:32:56.683,Did he exchange words with Ashur?
00:32:56.809,00:32:58.769,Ashur?
00:32:58.894,00:33:00.854,"He was there, was he not?"
00:33:00.979,00:33:02.355,I do not recall.
00:33:04.149,00:33:08.904,Surely if you set your mind to the task...
00:33:09.028,00:33:11.448,"Apologies, but I must return to the villa."
00:33:13.325,00:33:18.037,The fear in your eyes betray the lie on your tongue.
00:33:18.163,00:33:21.458,Your questions put me in harm's way.
00:33:21.583,00:33:24.002,Please. Let me pass.
00:33:33.595,00:33:37.557,The day approaches when I'm finally free of this.
00:33:37.683,00:33:40.894,Perhaps you can fashion a proper cock from it.
00:33:41.770,00:33:43.772,Remove yourselves.
00:33:45.482,00:33:47.108,Remain.
00:33:52.071,00:33:54.449,I seek information.
00:33:54.574,00:33:55.492,On what subject?
00:33:55.617,00:33:57.870,Barca.
00:33:57.995,00:33:59.955,I understand he made wager upon the Theokoles fight.
00:34:00.079,00:34:03.959,"Yeah, and won a small fortune, applied towards his freedom."
00:34:04.083,00:34:06.753,With no thought towards Pietros?
00:34:06.879,00:34:08.421,Not enough coin remained to liberate him.
00:34:19.140,00:34:20.392,It is a stirring sight.
00:34:20.517,00:34:22.268,To see the bonds of servitude lifted.
00:34:22.394,00:34:23.729,Hm.
00:34:23.854,00:34:27.524,I confess my eyes swimming as Barca took leave of the villa.
00:34:30.360,00:34:32.404,Who else offered farewells?
00:34:32.529,00:34:35.908,"Ah, only our master and myself."
00:34:38.952,00:34:44.165,Naevia claims to have escorted Barca to the gates.
00:34:44.290,00:34:47.794,She made no mention of your presents.
00:34:47.920,00:34:49.546,"Why, she's a simple thing, her mind easily.."
00:34:49.671,00:34:54.092,Stories in conflict give me concern.
00:34:54.217,00:34:57.470,If I find there is more to the matter of Barca's departure...
00:35:24.706,00:35:27.626,You still believe in them?
00:35:30.796,00:35:32.672,Yes.
00:35:32.798,00:35:34.841,Why?
00:35:38.678,00:35:41.347,Our entire village is gone.
00:35:41.473,00:35:44.142,"Everyone we knew, dead."
00:35:45.978,00:35:49.230,If there are no gods...
00:35:49.355,00:35:51.608,there is nothing to shape what happens in our lives...
00:35:53.485,00:35:55.320,There is no meaning to any of it.
00:36:03.202,00:36:06.164,I cannot believe the gods would lead me to you...
00:36:06.289,00:36:10.627,to bless me with such love...
00:36:10.752,00:36:14.006,only to make me bare witness to your suffering.
00:36:14.840,00:36:16.842,No.
00:36:16.967,00:36:20.637,There is a deeper purpose to the path you've been set upon.
00:36:20.762,00:36:23.264,One that has yet to reveal itself.
00:36:25.266,00:36:28.895,I will never see you from my side again.
00:36:29.021,00:36:32.357,"Without you, there is no reason for breath."
00:36:32.482,00:36:34.734,There is always reason to live.
00:36:34.860,00:36:36.069,I would be lost.
00:36:36.194,00:36:37.863,No.
00:36:39.572,00:36:42.117,The gods would set you on the proper path.
00:36:43.451,00:36:47.122,All you have to do is close your eyes...
00:36:48.581,00:36:51.334,and place yourself in their hands.
00:37:06.016,00:37:07.517,We leave for the games.
00:37:07.642,00:37:09.728,Is your decision made?
00:37:10.645,00:37:13.439,It is.
00:37:17.694,00:37:21.447,What sort of answer is this?
00:37:21.573,00:37:23.491,A gesture.
00:37:27.579,00:37:30.123,I care not for its means of delivery.
00:37:32.458,00:37:34.502,"Out with it, then."
00:37:38.256,00:37:42.969,Sura spoke often to me of the gods.
00:37:43.095,00:37:44.888,She believed in them.
00:37:45.013,00:37:48.641,I never truly have.
00:37:48.767,00:37:52.812,"The cock on you, daring to doubt the gods!"
00:37:52.938,00:37:56.066,And I have suffered much for it.
00:37:56.191,00:37:58.568,But no longer.
00:37:58.693,00:38:01.279,From this point forward...
00:38:05.700,00:38:08.078,and embrace my fate.
00:38:08.203,00:38:12.749,Your words give my heart great joy.
00:38:12.874,00:38:19.047,Enough even to erase questions of how a blade belonging to the Magistrate's son came to your possession.
00:38:20.882,00:38:24.761,Let us put the past truly behind us.
00:38:24.886,00:38:28.306,Come the games await you.
00:38:28.431,00:38:31.101,I have but one condition.
00:38:31.226,00:38:33.270,Condition?
00:38:33.394,00:38:35.855,You kiss my cheek only to finger my ass?!
00:38:35.981,00:38:38.275,Uh! Speak!
00:38:38.399,00:38:40.986,Before I carve out your fucking tongue.
00:38:41.111,00:38:45.573,I will take to the sands against the spectre of my countrymen.
00:38:45.698,00:38:47.617,But I will face them alone.
00:38:47.742,00:38:50.287,Six to your one?
00:38:50.411,00:38:52.956,I will not risk the Champion of Capua to such absurdity.
00:38:53.081,00:38:59.337,"If this is my fate, if this is the path the gods have truly set me upon..."
00:38:59.462,00:39:00.797,then they will not see me fall.
00:39:00.922,00:39:04.676,And if you are wrong?
00:39:04.801,00:39:10.015,Then I will give your city a great spectacle of blood...
00:39:10.140,00:39:12.100,before joining my wife.
00:39:22.152,00:39:25.864,I believe they are not done with you yet.
00:39:25.989,00:39:28.950,But I have a condition of my own.
00:39:29.075,00:39:45.508,"When you have killed the last of these shits garbed as your countrymen, what's left of the Thracian inside you dies with them and you will embrace this fate and your destiny as Spartacus, the Champion of Capua."
00:40:22.837,00:40:24.381,Citizens of Capua!
00:40:27.717,00:40:34.182,"Today, we honor the noble Marcus Minucius Rufus."
00:40:41.398,00:40:50.489,"As tribute, good Mercato has seen fit to re-enact his grandfather's most famous victory against the Thracian hordes!"
00:40:59.916,00:41:03.086,Gaze at the prisoners standing before you.
00:41:03.211,00:41:06.756,And imagine the Thracian Maedi that invaded Macedonia.
00:41:06.881,00:41:09.426,"Rape, pillaging its noble people."
00:41:09.550,00:41:11.636,Murdering all in their path...
00:41:11.761,00:41:13.679,even a Roman governor!
00:41:21.854,00:41:26.192,Violence and madness swept the land.
00:41:26.318,00:41:32.449,"Echoing into the heavens, where the gods themselves turned their backs."
00:41:32.573,00:41:38.955,"All seemed lost, until Rome dispatched it's favored son..."
00:41:39.080,00:41:42.834,Enter Marcus Minucius Rufus!
00:41:47.797,00:41:53.136,"For the honorable role of Rufus, there was but one choice."
00:41:53.261,00:41:56.264,The Bringer of Rain!
00:41:56.389,00:41:59.184,The Slayer of Theokoles!
00:41:59.309,00:42:01.227,The Champion of Capua...
00:42:01.353,00:42:03.021,Stand up!
00:42:03.146,00:42:05.440,I present to you.
00:42:06.565,00:42:09.527,Spartacus!!!
00:42:21.247,00:42:22.332,Spartacus!
00:42:22.457,00:42:23.500,Spartacus!
00:42:23.624,00:42:26.002,Spartacus!
00:42:29.255,00:42:31.049,I thought it was your grandfather we honor.
00:42:31.174,00:42:33.551,Yet the crowd chants Spartacus.
00:42:35.387,00:42:37.472,"Worry not of details, good Mercato."
00:42:41.226,00:42:42.394,Come!
00:42:42.519,00:42:45.063,Give the signal to begin the glorious victory!
00:42:46.272,00:42:49.942,In honor of Marcus Minucius Rufus...
00:42:50.068,00:42:52.320,Let blood be shed!
00:43:13.674,00:43:20.014,All you have to do is close your eyes and place yourself in their hands...
00:44:14.235,00:44:16.237,Yeah!
00:45:10.667,00:45:14.337,You do realize my grandfather won this battle?
00:45:14.462,00:45:17.965,Perhaps this day history will not repeat itself.
00:45:45.076,00:45:47.953,There is always a reason to live.
00:45:48.079,00:45:51.457,The gods would set you on the proper path.
00:45:51.583,00:45:53.585,YEAH!
00:46:35.585,00:46:38.003,He fights like a man possessed.
00:46:38.129,00:46:40.381,By the gods themselves.
00:46:45.010,00:46:46.679,Kill!
00:46:46.803,00:46:47.804,Kill!
00:46:47.930,00:46:50.642,Kill!
00:47:21.631,00:47:22.799,Kill!
00:47:22.923,00:47:24.258,Kill!
00:47:24.383,00:47:26.719,Kill!
00:47:39.816,00:47:42.318,Don't.
00:48:33.077,00:48:35.204,A marvelous show!
00:48:36.372,00:48:37.540,An honor to be of service.
00:48:37.665,00:48:39.417,Spartacus!
00:48:39.542,00:48:41.627,Spartacus!
00:48:41.753,00:48:45.715,Spartacus!
00:48:55.433,00:48:56.559,I...
00:48:56.684,00:48:57.476,AM...
00:48:57.602,00:48:59.186,Spartacus!!!
00:48:59.311,00:49:00.855,Spartacus!
00:49:00.979,00:49:03.190,Spartacus!
