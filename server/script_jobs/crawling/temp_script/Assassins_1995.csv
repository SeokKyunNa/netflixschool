00:09:31.291,00:09:37.667,"AT THAT TIME, HE WAS QUESTIONED FOR HIS ALLEGED FINANCING OF RIGHT-WING DEATH SQUADS THROUGHOUT SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA."
00:09:37.709,00:09:40.166,"BRANCH WAS BORN IN QUEENS, NEW YORK."
00:09:40.208,00:09:44.792,"AS YOU SEE FROM THE WHEELCHAIR, HE'S THE VICTIM OF A HIT MAN'S BULLET."

00:10:51.583,00:10:53.041,LET US PRAY.
00:10:53.083,00:11:01.333,"LORD JESUS CHRIST, BY THE THREE DAYS YOU LAY IN THE TOMB, YOU MADE HOLY THE GRAVES OF ALL WHO BELIEVE IN YOU."
00:11:01.375,00:11:06.125,"THOUGH THEY LIE IN THE EARTH, THEY TRUST THAT THEY, LIKE YOU, WILL RISE."
00:11:06.166,00:11:15.709,"BLESS THIS GRAVE, O LORD, AND GIVE SAMUEL PEACEFUL REST UNTIL THE DAY THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIGHT WILL RAISE HIM UP TO GLORY."
00:11:15.750,00:11:21.000,"MAY SAMUEL SEE THE LIGHT OF HIS PRESENCE, LORD JESUS, IN THE KINGDOM WHERE YOU LIVE FOREVER."
00:11:21.041,00:11:22.250,AMEN.
00:11:22.291,00:11:27.500,"AS GOD HAS CALLED ON BROTHER SAMUEL TO-- OH, MY GOD."

01:25:17.500,01:25:19.959,HE'S GOING TO THINK HE MISSED ME.
01:25:20.000,01:25:24.458,HE'LL WANT TO SEE WITH HIS OWN EYES WHETHER I'M STILL IN THE BANK.
01:25:24.500,01:25:26.625,AND THEN IT'LL BE SUNSET...
01:25:26.667,01:25:28.500,CLOSING TIME.
01:25:30.667,01:25:33.667,"HE'S GOING TO GET DESPERATE, REAL DESPERATE."
01:25:33.709,01:25:36.667,HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE HIS RIFLE BEHIND...
01:25:36.709,01:25:38.667,INSIDE.
01:25:38.709,01:25:40.667,HE'S RIGHT-HANDED.
01:25:40.709,01:25:48.208,"HE WON'T BE ABLE TO TAKE A PISTOL WITH HIM BECAUSE OF THE METAL DETECTORS, AND HE'S GOING TO BE VERY NERVOUS."
01:25:50.208,01:25:54.667,"AND WHEN HE'S OUT OF SIGHT, YOU COME UP HERE AND TAKE THE RIFLE."
01:25:54.709,01:25:58.667,HE'LL SHOOT YOU BEFORE YOU GO INTO THE BANK.
01:25:58.709,01:26:02.583,"NO, HE'LL WAIT FOR THE PRIME SHOT..."
01:26:04.875,01:26:06.917,WHEN I COME OUT.
01:26:09.709,01:26:12.375,HE'LL WANT TO SEE MY EYES.
01:26:18.291,01:26:20.750,WHY ARE YOU SO SURE?
01:26:24.250,01:26:27.208,HE LOVES HISTORY.
01:26:27.250,01:26:31.750,"15 YEARS AGO, IN THIS SAME ROOM..."
01:26:33.208,01:26:35.333,IN THIS SAME WINDOW...
01:26:36.750,01:26:38.291,I WAS HERE.
01:26:43.208,01:26:45.208,"OH, MY GOD."
01:26:46.750,01:26:49.917,"YOUR FRIEND NICOLAI, YOU SAID HE WAS TAKEN."
01:26:53.250,01:26:55.500,YOU KILLED HIM.
01:27:25.792,01:27:27.750,SEÑOR! GRACIAS.
01:27:27.792,01:27:29.542,IT'S FINE.
01:28:40.375,01:28:41.834,WHO IS IT?
01:28:41.875,01:28:43.041,ROOM SERVICE.
01:28:44.041,01:28:46.500,I DIDN'T ORDER ANY ROOM SERVICE.
01:28:46.542,01:28:48.208,I DID.
01:28:50.375,01:28:52.875,YOU SHOULD TELL ME THESE THINGS.

01:29:15.917,01:29:17.542,THE DAY OF THE DEAD.
01:29:17.583,01:29:19.750,WHAT ARE THE FLOWERS FOR?
01:29:19.792,01:29:29.375,THE FAMILIES MAKE A PATH FROM THEIR HOMES TO THE CEMETERY WITH THE FLOWER PETALS SO THE SOULS OF THE DEAD LOVED ONES CAN FIND THEIR WAY HOME.
01:29:29.417,01:29:30.875,THAT'S NICE.
01:29:30.917,01:29:33.000,"PLEASE, CALL ME ANYTIME FOR THE TRAY."
01:29:33.041,01:29:34.125,O.K. GRACIAS.

01:29:45.834,01:29:48.792,"NO, HE'S HERE NOW."
01:29:48.834,01:29:51.375,SO WE'RE STAYING IN THE HOTEL. THAT'S IT.
01:29:51.417,01:29:53.875,THE ENEMY OF FUN.
01:29:53.917,01:29:56.208,I BOUGHT YOU A BEER.
01:30:03.375,01:30:05.375,"HEY, PEARL, COME HERE."

01:30:47.041,01:30:50.959,I WISH I COULD EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY I KILLED NICOLAI.
01:30:51.000,01:30:55.458,"I GUESS AT THE TIME IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO, BUT..."
01:30:55.500,01:30:57.458,I'M SORRY I DID IT.
01:30:57.500,01:31:00.917,IT'S SOMETHING I'VE HAD TO LIVE WITH FOR 15 YEARS.
01:31:00.959,01:31:07.959,"I USED TO WISH THE SAME THING WOULD HAPPEN TO ME, AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MY WAY OUT..."
01:31:08.000,01:31:09.667,PERMANENTLY.
01:31:11.041,01:31:13.208,BUT NOT ANYMORE.

01:32:26.583,01:32:29.542,"ONE DAY YOU'RE HERE, THE NEXT DAY YOU'RE DOWN THERE."

01:32:32.208,01:32:34.250,"YEAH, LOTS OF PEOPLE DOWN THERE."

01:35:54.250,01:35:55.709,DON'T LOSE THIS.
01:35:55.750,01:35:57.709,"WHAT'S THAT, A TWO-WAY?"
01:35:57.750,01:36:01.083,THEY SAW YOU COMING.
01:36:01.125,01:36:06.709,"LISTEN, YOU TELL ME WHEN HE LEAVES THE HOTEL, I'LL TELL YOU WHEN HE LEAVES THE BANK."
01:36:06.750,01:36:08.917,JUST IN CASE.
01:36:08.959,01:36:11.834,"UH, NO, I CAN'T SHOOT ANYBODY."

01:36:21.250,01:36:24.083,YOU EVER PLAY COWBOY AND INDIANS?
01:36:24.125,01:36:25.583,"YEAH, SURE."
01:36:25.625,01:36:27.583,WHICH ONE WERE YOU?
01:36:27.625,01:36:29.250,AN INDIAN.
01:36:29.291,01:36:31.250,I WAS ALWAYS AN INDIAN.
01:36:31.291,01:36:32.750,ALWAYS THE INDIAN.
01:36:32.792,01:36:38.583,"JUST PRETEND HE'S A COWBOY AND PULL THE TRIGGER, THEN PRETEND HE GETS UP."
01:36:38.625,01:36:40.959,BUT YOU'VE GOT TO PULL THE TRIGGER.
01:36:41.000,01:36:43.417,YOU'VE GOT TO.

01:37:20.000,01:37:21.959,I DON'T SEE HIM.
01:37:22.000,01:37:25.166,I'M LOOKING ALL AROUND THE SQUARE.
01:37:28.875,01:37:30.875,I'M IN THE BANK.

01:37:41.709,01:37:43.667,HE'S HERE.
01:37:43.709,01:37:46.542,HE'S HEADING TOWARDS THE HOTEL.
01:37:48.375,01:37:50.333,HE'S ALMOST AT THE DOOR.
01:37:50.375,01:37:53.834,"OH, MY GOD. O.K., HE'S ALMOST--YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH."

01:37:58.709,01:38:00.166,RELAX.
01:38:00.208,01:38:02.667,HE MUST BE UPSTAIRS.
01:38:02.709,01:38:04.792,DO YOU WANT ME TO GO?
01:38:04.834,01:38:07.792,SHOULD I STAY?

01:38:09.333,01:38:10.792,"GODDAMN, IT'S HOT."
01:38:10.834,01:38:13.875,I'D RATHER BE OUT THERE THAN IN HERE.
01:38:15.417,01:38:17.375,"MAY I HELP YOU, SIR?"
01:38:17.417,01:38:19.917,I'M EXPECTING A TRANSFER.

01:39:51.000,01:39:52.959,"YES, I AM."
01:39:53.000,01:39:55.959,THIS WILL TAKE SOME TIME.

01:42:08.959,01:42:18.125,"ALL RIGHT, ONCE UPON A TIME, THERE WAS THIS LITTLE SPARROW WHO, WHILE FLYING SOUTH FOR THE WINTER, FROZE SOLID AND FELL TO THE GROUND."
01:42:18.166,01:42:21.000,"TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, A COW CRAPPED ON HIM."
01:42:21.041,01:42:24.000,"BUT THE MANURE WAS ALL WARM, AND IT DEFROSTED HIM."
01:42:24.041,01:42:29.000,"SO HE'S WARM, AND HE'S HAPPY TO BE ALIVE, AND HE STARTS TO SING."
01:42:29.041,01:42:34.875,"A HUNGRY CAT COMES ALONG, AND HE CLEARS OFF THE MANURE, AND HE EATS THE LITTLE BIRD."
01:42:34.917,01:42:45.834,"THE MORAL OF THE STORY IS THIS-- EVERYONE WHO CRAPS ON YOU IS NOT NECESSARILY YOUR ENEMY, AND EVERYONE WHO GETS YOU OUT OF CRAP IS NOT NECESSARILY YOUR FRIEND."
01:42:45.875,01:42:52.208,"AND IF YOU'RE WARM AND HAPPY, NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT."
01:42:52.250,01:42:54.208,HA HA HA HA.
01:42:56.792,01:42:58.083,"YOU LIKE THAT, HUH?"
01:43:13.959,01:43:17.417,"LOOK, RATH, I THINK I'M RUNNING OUT OF STORIES."
01:43:17.458,01:43:19.959,"SERIOUSLY, KEEP YOUR EYE ON THAT BUILDING."
01:43:20.000,01:43:22.083,HE'S GOT TO BE GETTING VERY IMPATIENT.
01:43:22.125,01:43:27.959,"HE HAS TO MAKE HIS MOVE VERY SOON. AND, ELECTRA, THANKS FOR THE STORIES."
01:43:53.792,01:43:56.750,SORRY I'VE BEEN TAKING UP THE TABLE. HERE.
01:43:56.792,01:43:59.709,"O.K., THANK YOU."

01:46:24.417,01:46:27.208,"DAMN, HE WAITED FOUR MINUTES LONGER THAN I DID."
01:46:27.250,01:46:28.500,HE'S COMING.
01:46:30.333,01:46:31.333,GO.

01:46:42.166,01:46:43.875,WHERE ARE YOU?
01:46:43.917,01:46:46.583,I'M HERE.
01:46:48.208,01:46:50.792,THE RIFLE SHOULD BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
01:46:50.834,01:46:53.792,"IF SO, THE GUN'S GOT TO BE RIGHT...HERE."
01:46:53.834,01:46:55.000,IT'S NOT HERE.
01:46:55.041,01:46:56.417,"ELECTRA, WHAT'S HAPPENING?"
01:46:59.166,01:47:00.166,IT'S NOT HERE.

01:47:22.709,01:47:24.709,"ELECTRA, HAVE YOU LEFT?"
01:47:27.709,01:47:30.000,"OH, JESUS, MARY, AND JOSEPH."
01:47:30.041,01:47:32.000,I FOUND IT!
01:48:16.750,01:48:19.417,"IT'S A DAMN HOT DAY, ISN'T IT?"
