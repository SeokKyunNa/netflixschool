00:02:12.299,00:02:13.466,You got this.
00:02:32.277,00:02:33.528,Hi.
00:02:36.198,00:02:37.782,I'm Clary Fray.
00:02:47.083,00:02:50.127,This landscape is very... decorative.
00:02:50.837,00:02:53.798,"Well, I wasn't really going for decorative, exactly."
00:02:53.881,00:02:56.593,"-What are those? -Oh, those. Nothing, just, um..."
00:03:01.223,00:03:03.766,"Really, it's just there by mistake."
00:03:05.059,00:03:07.895,The Brooklyn Academy of Art doesn't believe in mistakes.
00:03:13.235,00:03:16.195,Give me the professors' names and I... I will end them.
00:03:17.280,00:03:18.948,"You know, with... with a scathing e-mail to the dean."
00:03:19.031,00:03:20.617,Don't bother.
00:03:30.418,00:03:32.587,"Well played, well played."
00:03:32.670,00:03:34.672,"Thank you. You know, it's weird."
00:03:34.756,00:03:39.176,"They kind of liked my assigned work, but they flipped out over the drawings for our graphic novel."
00:03:41.513,00:03:43.390,as the greatest 18th birthday I ever had.
00:03:43.473,00:03:45.600,Which is why we are celebrating tonight.
00:03:45.683,00:03:48.228,"-Yes, with Maureen, after our show. -Absolutely."
00:03:48.311,00:03:51.398,So... what's the deal with you and Maureen?
00:03:51.481,00:03:54.984,What deal? No deal. We sing together.
00:03:55.067,00:03:57.779,You seriously don't know she's been crushing on you this whole time?
00:03:59.697,00:04:05.620,"Simon, how can someone as smart and perceptive as you not realize that the person sitting right there is in love with you?"
00:04:06.788,00:04:10.250,"I guarantee you I'm not the only smart, perceptive person to make that mistake."
00:04:15.797,00:04:16.881,That's a latte.
00:04:16.964,00:04:18.341,But I could have sworn I had a biscotti.
00:04:18.425,00:04:20.343,Maybe you ate it really fast and didn't even notice.
00:04:20.427,00:04:23.263,Happens to me all the time. When I'm happy... when I'm sad.
00:04:25.348,00:04:26.433,-with an actual one. -Thank you.
00:04:26.516,00:04:28.351,You know what? Here's to you.
00:04:45.952,00:04:47.995,"Yeah, this one's drained of blood."
00:04:55.837,00:04:57.297,This makes seven.
00:04:57.380,00:04:59.424,"Yeah, not good."
00:05:05.888,00:05:07.599,We're thinking formalin pump.
00:05:07.682,00:05:09.601,Alaric and I are chasing down a bunch of leads.
00:05:13.438,00:05:15.357,"You know she can tell when you decline a call, right?"
00:05:15.440,00:05:16.483,Yep.
00:05:17.484,00:05:18.901,I need you to do something for me.
00:05:18.985,00:05:20.236,What? Catch these guys?
00:05:20.320,00:05:21.529,Besides that.
00:05:21.613,00:05:24.198,Marry Jocelyn. What are you waiting for?
00:05:24.281,00:05:25.325,"Me and Jocelyn, we're..."
00:05:32.289,00:05:35.042,"You're already acting like a husband, go be one."
00:05:47.597,00:05:49.265,"-Hey, Dot. -Hey!"
00:05:49.348,00:05:50.600,How's your future looking?
00:05:50.683,00:05:52.184,-Not as good as yours. -Hmm.
00:05:52.268,00:05:55.271,The tarot cards tell me you got into the advanced program.
00:05:55.354,00:05:58.357,"And by the tarot cards, you mean, Simon's Twitter account?"
00:06:00.693,00:06:03.738,"Turns out, predicting the future with tarot cards is very complicated."
00:06:03.821,00:06:07.492,"But, I do see a birthday present in your future."
00:06:10.453,00:06:11.538,Wow!
00:06:11.621,00:06:14.916,"Yeah, you might want to keep that on the DL, 'cause your mom's my boss and I don't want her to flip out."
00:06:17.627,00:06:21.047,"You know, you're way better at gift-giving than magically predicting the future."
00:06:21.130,00:06:24.008,Nothing magical about it. I just buy the things I wanna wear.
00:06:25.468,00:06:26.886,-Happy birthday. -Thank you.
00:06:26.969,00:06:28.054,"I love you, Clary."
00:06:31.683,00:06:32.684,You okay?
00:06:37.939,00:06:39.524,Go up and see your mom.
00:06:53.455,00:06:56.791,-You also follow Simon? -He only has 92 followers.
00:06:58.918,00:07:01.629,"Thank you. Hashtag, stalker mom."
00:07:02.672,00:07:04.006,Happy birthday.
00:07:10.972,00:07:12.389,It's called a stele.
00:07:12.474,00:07:14.016,"What is it, like, a paperweight?"
00:07:14.100,00:07:16.018,"No, it's much more than that."
00:07:17.061,00:07:18.104,It's very ancient.
00:07:18.187,00:07:20.565,I want you to have it.
00:07:24.569,00:07:25.987,"-A few. -You know, it's weird."
00:07:26.070,00:07:28.322,I doodled something that looked like this this morning.
00:07:29.281,00:07:31.033,I must have seen this around the house somewhere.
00:07:33.786,00:07:34.829,Simon. He's on his way over.
00:07:34.912,00:07:36.914,-But we need to talk. -I can't right now. I gotta change.
00:07:36.998,00:07:39.208,-I'm going to see Champagne Enema tonight. -What?
00:07:39.291,00:07:40.710,"Yeah, I know. It's the new band name."
00:07:40.793,00:07:42.462,But Simon and Maureen are taking me out after.
00:07:42.545,00:07:46.382,"But it's... It's your 18th birthday, and, uh..."
00:07:47.717,00:07:49.343,everything's gonna change for you now.
00:07:49.426,00:07:52.013,"Mom, we've had the talk. I'm good."
00:07:52.096,00:07:55.892,We need to have a much different and more important talk.
00:07:56.601,00:07:57.602,And we will.
00:07:57.685,00:08:00.437,"But can it be over breakfast, all right?"
00:08:00.522,00:08:01.648,I love you.
00:08:02.899,00:08:04.108,Thank you for the heirloom.
00:08:04.191,00:08:05.401,I love you.
00:08:39.727,00:08:41.604,Your daughter looks just like you.
00:08:41.688,00:08:43.189,It's the hair.
00:09:12.509,00:09:14.095,Come on.
00:09:15.304,00:09:16.806,Magnus!
00:09:18.641,00:09:21.018,"Please, Magnus, only a warlock can do this."
00:09:21.102,00:09:22.103,Mom?
00:09:22.186,00:09:23.437,"It's okay, honey. It's for the best."
00:09:23.520,00:09:25.982,"You're not protecting her, you're deceiving her."
00:09:26.065,00:09:27.524,For as long as possible.
00:09:27.609,00:09:29.777,"She won't be a child forever, Jocelyn."
00:09:29.861,00:09:32.488,"For now, I don't want her part of our world."
00:09:32.572,00:09:34.406,"Mom, I don't wanna do this."
00:09:48.420,00:09:51.465,"Hey, sorry I'm late. Captain's got me on those demonic murders."
00:09:55.261,00:09:56.596,It's already happening.
00:09:56.679,00:09:59.515,We both knew this time was coming. We'll tell her together.
00:09:59.599,00:10:02.434,"No, it was my choice. I'll do it alone."
00:10:02.518,00:10:04.311,"All right. Well, do it soon."
00:10:04.395,00:10:06.522,"And if she's unprepared, your life is in danger."
00:10:06.606,00:10:07.607,And so is Clary's.
00:10:07.690,00:10:09.441,"-Hey, Luke, what's up? -Hey!"
00:10:09.525,00:10:11.110,"-Incredible drawings. -Oh, thanks."
00:10:11.193,00:10:12.194,And I got you these.
00:10:13.905,00:10:15.865,"-Spray paint. -Oh, they're perfect."
00:10:15.948,00:10:18.492,"If I catch any of that paint on city walls, I will arrest you."
00:10:18.575,00:10:19.911,The paint is for Simon's van.
00:10:19.994,00:10:22.204,"-I'm insisting they rename the band. -Oh, yes, please."
00:10:25.124,00:10:27.126,"The heirloom. Yeah, it's beautiful."
00:10:27.209,00:10:29.962,"-Clary, you're 18 now, and-- -What is with you guys?"
00:10:30.046,00:10:32.632,"I'm turning 18, it's not like I'm headed off on some epic journey."
00:10:33.800,00:10:39.931,"See, we are going to Lombardi's You should come back here after."
00:10:40.014,00:10:42.141,The city's not that safe right now.
00:10:42.224,00:10:44.310,"Ah, thanks, Mom, but we're set."
00:10:44.393,00:10:45.937,"Yeah, we will take a rain check."
00:10:46.020,00:10:48.397,Wait. Do I smell chicken cacciatore?
00:10:48.480,00:10:49.982,"Simon, your gig."
00:10:50.066,00:10:52.068,"-Oh, you're singing? -Yes, big gig."
00:10:56.781,00:10:58.866,"Breakfast, you and me, tomorrow."
00:10:58.950,00:10:59.951,-Promise? -Yep.
00:11:03.329,00:11:07.208,"Mom, you have to let me go. I'm biologically and legally an adult."
00:11:07.291,00:11:08.292,Yeah.
00:11:09.293,00:11:10.627,That's what I'm afraid of.
00:11:12.504,00:11:13.715,-Shall we? -Yes.
00:11:15.549,00:11:19.178,Just let her be a kid for one last day.
00:11:20.179,00:11:21.180,Okay.
00:11:24.308,00:11:26.518,when the alien queen was defending her eggs from Ripley?
00:11:26.602,00:11:29.856,"In this scenario, is my mom Ripley or the alien queen?"
00:11:29.939,00:11:31.107,-Both. -What?
00:11:31.190,00:11:32.817,A mother defending her young.
00:11:32.900,00:11:34.568,Defending me from what?
00:11:34.651,00:11:38.197,I spend all day in an art studio. My life couldn't be more mundane.
00:11:38.280,00:11:40.366,"Besides, I really don't know much about when she was young."
00:11:40.449,00:11:42.744,"Oh, just do what I do and get all the dirt from your relatives."
00:11:45.997,00:11:47.915,And my... my dad died before I was born.
00:11:47.999,00:11:49.375,"So, you have no one?"
00:11:49.458,00:11:52.544,"No uncles, no aunts, no third cousins, twice removed?"
00:11:52.628,00:11:54.171,"No, just me and my mom."
00:11:54.255,00:11:58.092,It's why the Lewis clan has added three chairs to every seder -since pre-school. -Mmm.
00:11:58.175,00:12:00.552,"One for Clary, one for Jocelyn, and one for Elijah."
00:12:00.636,00:12:02.847,"-Of course. Obviously. -Yes, obviously."
00:12:02.930,00:12:04.723,You guys don't think that's a little bit suspicious?
00:12:04.807,00:12:06.558,You not knowing anything about your family?
00:12:06.642,00:12:09.228,"Your mom could be hiding some deep, dark secret."
00:12:09.311,00:12:11.105,"Maureen, it's not possible."
00:12:11.188,00:12:12.606,"-No, no, think about it. -No, seriously."
00:12:12.689,00:12:15.651,My mother is incapable of concealing anything from me.
00:12:37.965,00:12:39.550,"Hey, there, big bro."
00:12:39.633,00:12:40.676,Really?
00:12:40.759,00:12:44.388,What can I say? Demons dig blondes.
00:12:44.471,00:12:46.390,"Of course they do, but that's white."
00:12:46.473,00:12:47.516,Platinum.
00:12:47.599,00:12:50.102,"And they don't exactly like Shakespeare, okay, Alec?"
00:12:50.186,00:12:51.687,You're plenty distracting on your own.
00:12:54.606,00:12:56.901,"Never mind. Looking good, let's go."
00:13:03.407,00:13:07.619,"All right, guys, for some reason our demon friends are killing mundanes and draining their blood."
00:13:07.703,00:13:10.456,Why do they want blood? Isn't that vampire territory?
00:13:10.539,00:13:11.623,"I don't know, Alec."
00:13:12.541,00:13:13.835,"Lazy vampires, maybe?"
00:13:15.837,00:13:18.005,What could be special about mundane blood?
00:13:18.089,00:13:21.968,You get me a sample and I'll tell you exactly what they're looking for.
00:13:22.051,00:13:25.304,We'll have more answers when we figure out exactly who the demons are working for.
00:13:25.387,00:13:27.223,"So, you don't think they're acting on their own?"
00:13:27.306,00:13:28.349,No.
00:13:28.432,00:13:31.602,"They're not exactly creative thinkers, they're shapeshifters."
00:13:33.645,00:13:35.689,This is what our target looks like.
00:13:38.860,00:13:40.862,Great. I'll get approval for the mission.
00:13:40.945,00:13:42.321,"Come on, Alec."
00:13:42.404,00:13:45.657,"By the time you've sent that message, we'll have killed six demons."
00:13:45.741,00:13:49.620,"Besides, it's more fun to break the rules than to follow them."
00:14:16.272,00:14:18.649,"Yeah, and thank you for being our artist in residence."
00:14:18.732,00:14:19.733,Of course.
00:14:21.986,00:14:24.655,"So, you went on stage tonight as Champagne Enema."
00:14:28.034,00:14:29.451,But now...
00:14:29.535,00:14:30.702,we're Rock Solid Panda.
00:14:30.786,00:14:32.288,"Yeah, we are."
00:14:32.371,00:14:35.124,"Rock Solid Panda, coming up. I'm feeling inspired."
00:14:36.833,00:14:37.834,-Paint. -Paint.
00:14:44.466,00:14:46.052,What's that tag?
00:14:49.805,00:14:51.640,Second time today.
00:14:51.723,00:14:57.688,"You know they have confirmed cases of people waking up in the morning speaking French, and they never even studied the language."
00:14:57.771,00:14:59.565,Do you think that's some kind of language?
00:14:59.648,00:15:00.983,Sanskrit maybe.
00:15:06.447,00:15:08.199,"Hey, can you watch where you're going?"
00:15:10.993,00:15:12.286,You can see me?
00:15:12.369,00:15:15.747,"Yeah, that's kind of the point, but you obviously didn't see me."
00:15:15.831,00:15:17.333,You have the Sight.
00:15:17.416,00:15:18.918,"Wait, the what?"
00:15:20.461,00:15:21.753,How can I not know who you are?
00:15:21.837,00:15:24.548,Has that line seriously ever worked for you?
00:15:24.631,00:15:25.632,Even once?
00:15:36.936,00:15:38.562,Can you guys believe that blonde dude?
00:15:38.645,00:15:41.315,You mean the imaginary dude you were talking to?
00:15:47.029,00:15:48.780,What guy are you talking about?
00:15:49.740,00:15:51.408,You guys seriously don't see him?
00:15:51.492,00:15:52.534,No.
00:15:53.744,00:15:55.579,"Okay, could you stop making me feel insane?"
00:15:55.662,00:15:57.248,Could you stop acting that way?
00:15:57.331,00:15:58.749,"Clary, what was in your latte?"
00:16:01.918,00:16:02.962,Where you going?
00:16:03.045,00:16:04.296,To get some answers.
00:16:04.380,00:16:05.797,"Remember, your fake ID sucks."
00:17:02.021,00:17:04.565,I'm gonna go fail at getting us some birthday drinks.
00:17:04.648,00:17:06.567,I'm gonna go fail with you.
00:17:06.650,00:17:07.859,Do you want some... Clary!
00:17:24.376,00:17:26.628,Circle members aren't welcome in my club.
00:17:28.797,00:17:30.966,"No worries, warlock. It's all ancient history."
00:17:31.050,00:17:34.761,"Really? To me, it was like a blink of an eye."
00:17:46.898,00:17:49.068,You've inflicted worse.
00:17:51.070,00:17:52.154,Leave.
00:18:09.755,00:18:11.298,Izzy.
00:18:35.906,00:18:37.449,Somebody works out.
00:18:38.450,00:18:39.535,Cool contacts.
00:18:43.330,00:18:46.208,I hear you've been pedaling mundane blood.
00:18:47.209,00:18:49.628,Why? Are you looking to score?
00:18:50.629,00:18:51.797,I'm not.
00:18:54.300,00:18:55.967,But you're gonna tell me who is.
00:18:56.968,00:18:58.470,"Well, you're outnumbered here."
00:19:00.222,00:19:02.015,"Oh, I like our odds."
00:19:04.310,00:19:05.602,Last chance.
00:19:09.105,00:19:10.566,Watch out!
00:20:22.304,00:20:23.722,But... Clary!
00:20:25.641,00:20:26.767,Clary!
00:20:31.605,00:20:32.773,Drive.
00:20:41.197,00:20:46.453,"And then these creepy tentacles seemed to come out of the body builder's face, and... and then the guy just... vaporized."
00:20:49.248,00:20:52.042,What did the markings look like on the blonde boy you were talking about?
00:20:52.125,00:20:55.170,"Who cares, Mom, okay? Are you even listening to me?"
00:20:55.254,00:20:56.338,I think I killed a guy.
00:20:56.422,00:20:59.508,Clary... did they look like this?
00:21:02.761,00:21:03.804,"Mom, what the..."
00:21:04.555,00:21:11.603,"Everything you saw tonight has a meaning and an explanation, and I've dreaded having this conversation with you since the day you were born."
00:21:11.687,00:21:12.688,What is going on?
00:21:17.609,00:21:18.902,But the protections are wearing off.
00:21:18.985,00:21:21.029,"You're 18 now, and you need to know the truth."
00:21:21.112,00:21:22.614,Protections? What does that even mean?
00:21:22.698,00:21:24.157,"Mom, you... Mom, you're scaring the hell out of me."
00:21:24.240,00:21:27.035,"I know, and that's why I've put this off until the last possible minute."
00:21:27.118,00:21:29.162,"Jocelyn, look out the window."
00:21:29.245,00:21:31.873,Magnus called to warn us. They found you.
00:21:35.168,00:21:36.753,"Dot, it's time."
00:21:37.588,00:21:39.715,"Okay, listen to me. You cannot be near me."
00:21:39.798,00:21:42.050,-What's happening? -I got a very powerful person angry.
00:21:42.133,00:21:43.302,What did you do?
00:21:43.385,00:21:45.304,I hid something from him and his followers.
00:21:45.387,00:21:47.097,Followers? Why can't we just call the police?
00:21:47.180,00:21:49.099,The policeman you need to call is Luke.
00:21:50.601,00:21:53.395,Keep this with you and think of me when you wear it.
00:21:53.479,00:21:55.230,"Mom, this is not the time for more birthday gifts."
00:21:55.314,00:21:57.899,-What the hell is happening? -Only if you need it.
00:22:00.110,00:22:03.405,Trust your instincts. You're more powerful than you know.
00:22:05.991,00:22:07.283,Take Jocelyn alive.
00:22:08.076,00:22:09.285,Find the Mortal Cup.
00:22:09.370,00:22:11.372,"-Mom, I need to understand what's-- -Dot, open it."
00:22:20.130,00:22:24.217,"Everything I've done, every mistake I've made was because I love you more than words."
00:22:24.300,00:22:25.927,-What are you doing? -Luke will explain everything.
00:22:26.011,00:22:27.429,-He'll hide you. -Hide me?
00:22:27.513,00:22:29.264,From the Circle. He's the only one you can trust.
00:22:29.347,00:22:30.432,Trust no one else.
00:22:30.516,00:22:32.142,"-Mom, I don't-- -Where's Luke now?"
00:22:32.225,00:22:34.478,"-At the police station! -Remember, I love you."
00:22:36.730,00:22:38.565,-Clary! -Mom!
00:22:46.698,00:22:47.699,Clary?
00:22:49.284,00:22:50.285,Captain Vargas.
00:22:51.202,00:22:53.038,It's 2:00 in the morning. What are you doing here so late?
00:22:53.121,00:22:54.247,"Uh, um..."
00:22:55.749,00:22:58.001,"Luke said he'd, uh, drive me home if he was still here."
00:22:58.084,00:22:59.795,"Still doesn't trust those cabbies, huh?"
00:23:00.879,00:23:03.632,"Well, he's in the middle of an interview. It could take a while."
00:23:07.135,00:23:10.764,"Hey, uh... is there some sort of problem?"
00:23:10.847,00:23:11.973,Guy trouble?
00:23:12.849,00:23:14.184,"Yeah, sure."
00:23:14.267,00:23:16.520,"Guy trouble, it's, uh... something like that."
00:24:06.111,00:24:07.821,I won't let them find you.
00:24:57.704,00:24:59.205,That's not gonna happen.
00:24:59.289,00:25:01.124,"After all these years, you're still after it?"
00:25:04.670,00:25:05.712,It's for him.
00:25:07.756,00:25:08.882,Valentine's still alive.
00:25:08.965,00:25:11.426,"He'll be pretty surprised to see that you are, too."
00:25:11.509,00:25:13.595,I won't let Valentine create an army.
00:25:13.679,00:25:15.346,You once believed in him.
00:25:15.430,00:25:18.099,I believed in protecting humankind.
00:25:23.104,00:25:24.314,You'll never get the Cup.
00:25:27.442,00:25:28.652,No!
00:25:35.659,00:25:37.202,you were easy to track.
00:25:37.285,00:25:38.286,Fairchild?
00:25:38.369,00:25:39.830,Turns out you and Jocelyn were never that far apart.
00:25:39.913,00:25:41.289,The Circle has her now.
00:25:41.372,00:25:43.584,It's just a matter of time until we catch the daughter.
00:25:43.667,00:25:46.002,You can have them both if you give up the Mortal Cup.
00:25:48.004,00:25:50.924,I don't care about either of them. They mean nothing to me.
00:25:54.135,00:25:55.261,My people want the Cup.
00:25:56.346,00:25:58.306,Why do you think I've been hanging around here all these years?
00:25:58.389,00:25:59.766,"Now, when I find the Cup..."
00:26:00.684,00:26:01.810,I'm gonna keep it.
00:26:01.893,00:26:03.979,And you can tell Valentine and the Circle that.
00:26:04.062,00:26:06.314,-No one mentioned Valentine. -You didn't have to.
00:26:06.397,00:26:08.316,"-Listen to me. -No, you listen to me."
00:26:09.317,00:26:10.652,Get out of my office.
00:27:13.423,00:27:15.967,"I'm so sorry it had to be this way, Jocelyn."
00:27:24.225,00:27:26.436,I told you to bring her back unharmed.
00:27:28.438,00:27:30.816,-What happened? -A potion.
00:27:30.899,00:27:33.026,She must have been under the protection of a warlock.
00:27:33.109,00:27:36.362,"She was in league with the Downworlder, hiding amongst the mundane."
00:27:36.446,00:27:37.488,Coward.
00:27:37.572,00:27:41.659,Jocelyn Fairchild was able to hide from the Circle for 18 years.
00:27:41.743,00:27:43.870,Do you think a coward is capable of something like that?
00:27:43.954,00:27:46.581,The only thing she's capable of is smelling like a mundane.
00:27:49.417,00:27:50.418,I'm sorry?
00:27:50.501,00:27:52.628,She betrayed the Circle.
00:27:52.713,00:27:54.047,She doesn't deserve our respect.
00:28:12.482,00:28:14.275,Mom! Mom!
00:29:29.600,00:29:30.685,Dot.
00:29:32.813,00:29:34.189,They took Jocelyn.
00:29:34.815,00:29:35.857,Who took her?
00:29:36.399,00:29:39.152,Rogue Shadowhunters searching for the Mortal Cup.
00:29:40.070,00:29:41.612,What the hell are you talking about?
00:29:42.488,00:29:43.614,"Think, Clary."
00:29:44.407,00:29:46.284,Did your mother ever talk to you about a cup?
00:29:46.367,00:29:47.577,A very important cup.
00:29:49.830,00:29:52.207,"No! No, I don't know anything about a cup, Dot."
00:29:54.167,00:29:55.501,"No, no, not those."
00:29:58.504,00:30:01.091,I can't think! Someone kidnapped my mother!
00:30:01.800,00:30:04.177,"You know more than you think you do, Clary Fray."
00:30:34.499,00:30:36.667,"What, no thank you for saving your life?"
00:30:39.045,00:30:41.131,Careful. That demon got a piece of you.
00:30:42.298,00:30:44.134,-Demons? -Yeah.
00:30:45.051,00:30:47.345,"What do you think that miserable, disgusting thing was?"
00:30:47.428,00:30:49.722,"I, uh... I thought it was Dot."
00:31:00.984,00:31:02.443,It's that bad?
00:31:08.741,00:31:09.825,I got you.
00:31:34.434,00:31:35.560,Ow.
00:31:37.478,00:31:39.522,"-Wait, I don't know who you-- -I'm Isabelle."
00:31:40.899,00:31:43.526,I've never seen Jace so curious about a mundane...
00:31:44.444,00:31:45.611,or distracted.
00:31:46.404,00:31:49.407,"Like you saw earlier, distractions are dangerous in our line of work."
00:31:51.659,00:31:52.911,Who's Jace?
00:31:52.994,00:31:54.829,"You really don't know much, do you?"
00:31:56.622,00:32:00.293,"All I know is some psychos took my mother, and now you people have taken me."
00:32:08.551,00:32:10.720,"-She's not a mundane, Alec. -How do you know that?"
00:32:10.803,00:32:12.638,Because the seraph blade lit up when she touched it.
00:32:12.722,00:32:14.515,"Look, Isabelle, can you..."
00:32:17.936,00:32:20.771,"-I'm, uh-- -Clary Fray, we know who you are."
00:32:20.855,00:32:24.442,"-Am I the only one who finds this unusual? -You find everything unusual, Alec."
00:32:29.530,00:32:32.700,"I love you, Alec, but you have a switch that's always on."
00:32:32.783,00:32:37.080,"I love you, too. But this-- Hey, you know what? Give me a minute."
00:32:40.041,00:32:42.168,Here's a word you never hear me say. Please?
00:32:44.004,00:32:45.213,What is with you?
00:32:45.296,00:32:46.631,"Really, no, what is with him?"
00:32:46.714,00:32:48.216,"Walk with me, big brother."
00:32:51.094,00:32:53.679,-I'll explain it to you. -We don't know this girl.
00:32:53.763,00:32:55.306,There's no such thing as new Shadowhunters.
00:32:55.390,00:32:57.642,-There is now. -You don't find that strange?
00:32:57.725,00:33:00.520,What I find strange is that you're so upset.
00:33:04.565,00:33:08.028,"You know, you should be happy that Jace is interested in someone other than himself."
00:33:08.111,00:33:10.030,Maybe I'm pissed that she's ruined the mission.
00:33:10.113,00:33:12.073,We never found out who's buying the blood.
00:33:12.157,00:33:13.741,That was our one job.
00:33:17.120,00:33:19.455,"Your wound, it's healed."
00:33:21.249,00:33:22.542,How is that even possible?
00:33:23.584,00:33:26.837,"So, what, I'm miraculously healed, and all of you..."
00:33:26.921,00:33:29.840,stunning people have magical powers?
00:33:32.552,00:33:35.471,-A what? -A warlock. It's one of the Downworlders.
00:33:35.555,00:33:37.473,"Okay, you're not making any sense."
00:33:38.641,00:33:42.562,"Warlocks, vampires, Seelies-- Literally my brain is about to explode."
00:33:42.645,00:33:44.689,"Jeez, all right. Well, I'll keep it simple for you."
00:33:45.773,00:33:47.567,All the legends are true.
00:33:48.651,00:33:50.528,We're Shadowhunters.
00:33:50.611,00:33:53.906,We protect the human world from the demon world.
00:33:53.989,00:34:00.746,"So those people you saw murdered at the Pandemonium, they weren't people at all, they were shapeshifting demons."
00:34:00.830,00:34:04.959,I'm not interested in being a part of your supernatural fight club.
00:34:06.211,00:34:08.254,I just wanna find my mom.
00:34:11.341,00:34:12.633,is finding my mother.
00:34:17.305,00:34:18.973,Please help me find her.
00:34:20.350,00:34:21.934,I'm the best chance you've got.
00:34:24.645,00:34:26.147,I don't even know you.
00:34:31.152,00:34:32.153,Simon.
00:34:32.862,00:34:34.905,How come you haven't answered your phone in two days?
00:34:34.989,00:34:37.283,Things are... all ripped apart.
00:34:37.367,00:34:38.784,Where are you?
00:34:38.868,00:34:41.954,Find My Friends says your phone is in an abandoned church on Deighton.
00:34:42.037,00:34:43.081,I'm outside.
00:34:50.004,00:34:51.422,I don't see you.
00:34:51.506,00:34:53.299,Give me five minutes. I have to get dressed.
00:34:55.760,00:34:57.928,"Clary, is there... Is there a meth problem we have to talk about?"
00:34:58.888,00:35:01.056,"Simon, just give me five minutes, okay?"
00:35:03.143,00:35:05.561,"Um, what, uh... What happened to my clothes?"
00:35:05.645,00:35:06.771,Demon venom.
00:35:06.854,00:35:08.398,Remember?
00:35:09.149,00:35:10.650,Isabelle left you these.
00:35:15.363,00:35:16.406,"You're kidding, right?"
00:35:16.489,00:35:19.074,She's very comfortable with her body.
00:35:20.743,00:35:22.036,Okay.
00:35:29.752,00:35:31.129,How did that get there?
00:35:31.212,00:35:32.547,I drew that.
00:35:32.630,00:35:33.756,"Okay, listen."
00:35:33.839,00:35:37.427,"I still don't get everything that's going on here, but you do not tattoo my neck."
00:35:37.510,00:35:38.553,That's creepy.
00:35:38.636,00:35:42.014,Duly noted. I guess next time I'll just let you die.
00:35:43.057,00:35:44.600,And it's not a tattoo.
00:35:45.768,00:35:46.894,It's a rune.
00:35:48.020,00:35:50.315,They have enormous power.
00:35:50.815,00:35:52.608,Good for Shadowhunters.
00:35:52.692,00:35:53.984,Lethal for humans.
00:35:54.068,00:35:57.029,"But you, you already know all about runes, don't you?"
00:36:02.535,00:36:03.661,Maybe you don't.
00:36:05.830,00:36:08.833,Which is what makes you so interesting...
00:36:08.916,00:36:10.918,Clary Fray.
00:36:13.379,00:36:16.216,I saw something behind your friend.
00:36:16.299,00:36:18.133,"You're not gonna kill Simon, are you?"
00:36:18.218,00:36:21.596,"Protect the humans, kill the demons. You'll get it eventually."
00:36:23.639,00:36:25.308,"So, why can't Simon see you?"
00:36:26.434,00:36:30.730,"This is a glamour, a rune that makes me invisible to mundanes."
00:36:30.813,00:36:33.941,"It's a shame, really, 'cause... well, denying them all this."
00:36:35.985,00:36:38.904,"What do you have on, Clary?"
00:36:40.573,00:36:41.782,Let me take you home.
00:36:42.575,00:36:44.535,I don't think I have one anymore.
00:36:44.619,00:36:46.454,Why? What do you mean?
00:36:48.414,00:36:49.624,Well...
00:36:59.217,00:37:00.218,What are you looking at?
00:37:00.301,00:37:02.345,"If you give us the girl, I'll let you live."
00:37:02.428,00:37:04.847,You're in no position to be making rules.
00:37:06.641,00:37:07.892,Clary...
00:37:24.284,00:37:26.035,-Jace! -Excuse me?
00:37:27.328,00:37:29.372,-Is he dead? -Is who dead?
00:37:33.668,00:37:35.002,What the...
00:37:35.085,00:37:39.048,"Could you deglamourize, or whatever, so my best friend doesn't think I'm losing my mind?"
00:37:46.347,00:37:48.724,Um... what is happening?
00:37:48.808,00:37:51.394,"Yeah, we don't have the luxury right now, kid. Everyone back inside."
00:37:51.477,00:37:52.812,"Clary, who is this? Your meth dealer?"
00:37:52.895,00:37:55.189,I've seen him before. At the police station.
00:37:55.273,00:37:57.900,"He's a member of the Circle. Clary, he's here for you."
00:37:57.983,00:37:59.360,He's with the people who took my mother.
00:37:59.444,00:38:01.946,"Right, your little best friend here led him right to you."
00:38:02.029,00:38:03.489,He's here to capture or kill you.
00:38:04.156,00:38:06.075,"There's a dead body there, we have to call Luke."
00:38:06.158,00:38:08.828,"We can't trust Luke, Simon. We can't."
00:38:08.911,00:38:11.497,"Clary, I need to keep you safe."
00:38:12.415,00:38:16.043,"I promise you, I promise I am gonna help you find your mother."
00:38:17.044,00:38:19.004,But you're one of us. You're a Shadowhunter.
00:38:20.255,00:38:24.635,"Clary... you don't know this guy, all right?"
00:38:24.719,00:38:26.846,Come with me. I can get us help.
00:38:26.929,00:38:28.055,"Clary, please."
00:38:28.138,00:38:29.682,"Clary, come on."
00:38:34.395,00:38:36.397,I don't see the Mortal Cup!
00:38:37.773,00:38:39.525,We searched.
00:38:39.609,00:38:41.611,It's not in the loft.
00:38:41.694,00:38:45.239,Just because you couldn't find it doesn't mean it isn't there.
00:38:48.618,00:38:50.244,There's a daughter.
00:38:53.205,00:38:54.957,There's no sign of the father.
00:38:55.875,00:38:57.585,Could be a mundane.
00:39:01.672,00:39:02.965,Jocelyn has a daughter?
00:39:05.175,00:39:09.389,"Well, in that case, I'd like to speak to Jocelyn's daughter."
00:00:10.010,00:00:11.219,All the legends are true.
00:00:14.347,00:00:16.808,We protect the human world from the demon world.
00:00:16.891,00:00:18.643,-You're deceiving her. -For as long as possible.
00:00:18.726,00:00:19.811,Take her memories.
00:00:19.894,00:00:21.313,"Dot, open it."
00:00:23.022,00:00:24.149,You'll never get the Cup.
00:00:24.232,00:00:26.234,-No! -Someone kidnapped my mother!
00:00:26.318,00:00:27.569,You know more than you think you do.
00:00:29.737,00:00:30.822,I got you.
00:00:32.240,00:00:34.992,so my best friend doesn't think I'm losing my mind?
00:00:35.077,00:00:37.204,-I need to keep you safe. -I can get us help.
00:00:48.465,00:00:51.843,"Simon, I think Jace can help us."
00:00:53.636,00:00:55.430,-What? -Come on.
00:00:58.391,00:01:02.187,"-is even gonna try-- -Mundane, we do not have the time."
00:01:24.292,00:01:25.960,I know. Trust me.
00:01:26.043,00:01:27.337,"He's, like, burning himself."
00:01:29.756,00:01:30.882,"Buddy, what's going on, man?"
00:01:30.965,00:01:32.342,"I'm not your type, man. I don't even..."
00:01:46.606,00:01:48.150,What the hell?
00:01:49.692,00:01:52.612,"Clary, is there a war going on that I don't know about?"
00:01:53.113,00:01:54.364,There is now.
00:01:54.447,00:01:56.199,I think my mother's at the center of it.
00:02:04.832,00:02:07.460,"There's a lot of gear in here. What'd they do, rob a tech shop?"
00:02:15.343,00:02:17.595,So this cold-blooded killer is gonna help us?
00:02:17.679,00:02:19.764,He's not a killer. He's protecting us.
00:02:19.847,00:02:22.767,"Specifically, you. It's sort of our thing."
00:02:22.850,00:02:24.686,Your thing? You guys have a thing?
00:02:24.769,00:02:26.688,He means a Shadowhunter thing.
00:02:26.771,00:02:29.065,"That's what they do, protecting humans from demons."
00:02:29.149,00:02:33.027,"Demons, right. That makes perfect sense, 'cause there are demons running all around New York."
00:02:33.110,00:02:35.530,That is the first correct thing you've said all day.
00:02:46.040,00:02:47.792,and then the area will be clear.
00:02:47.875,00:02:49.711,What is going on?
00:02:49.794,00:02:52.129,Why is there a mundane in the Institute?
00:02:54.757,00:02:56.926,"A Circle rune, just like the guys that took my mother."
00:02:57.009,00:03:00.054,What exactly is a Circle member and why are they trying to kill us?
00:03:00.597,00:03:03.891,All we know is... a long time ago the Circle led a revolt.
00:03:03.975,00:03:05.435,A lot of Shadowhunters got killed...
00:03:06.394,00:03:07.437,including my father.
00:03:09.564,00:03:11.691,to even hear about the Circle.
00:03:11.774,00:03:14.277,"But, how is that even possible? It's your history."
00:03:17.029,00:03:18.906,"Yeah. Yeah, you're right."
00:03:18.990,00:03:24.454,"And now the only person who knows the truth is missing, so I don't care about your rules or what's forbidden, I'm..."
00:03:24.537,00:03:33.546,"There's got to be someone out there who can tell us No, no, no. Not you."
00:03:33.630,00:03:35.047,"-Hey, we're a package deal. -Yeah."
00:03:35.131,00:03:38.385,There are runes all over the training room floor that would kill your mundie boyfriend.
00:03:38.468,00:03:42.764,"-He's not my-- -I'm not, like-- We're, uh, just friends."
00:03:42.847,00:03:44.599,Best friends.
00:03:44.682,00:03:46.726,"Yeah, and I'm tough."
00:03:46.809,00:03:49.687,"I can handle runes. So, uh, bring on the runes."
00:03:51.898,00:03:54.359,They give Shadowhunters our demon-fighting powers.
00:03:57.237,00:03:58.488,So hot.
00:04:03.451,00:04:05.828,I'll watch over the best friend.
00:04:05.912,00:04:07.622,"In fact, I was about to make breakfast."
00:04:13.753,00:04:16.548,Please excuse my brother's lack of manners.
00:04:16.631,00:04:19.551,This is Alec... and I'm Isabelle.
00:04:20.427,00:04:22.512,"Lewis. Simon, Simon Lewis."
00:04:22.595,00:04:24.055,Two first names. Am I still talking?
00:04:25.515,00:04:27.725,"-safe and sound here. -Jace, if anything happens to him..."
00:04:27.809,00:04:29.477,"Go on, I'll be fine."
00:04:33.898,00:04:35.733,Where are we going?
00:04:35.817,00:04:37.151,Training room.
00:04:37.234,00:04:38.611,"Hey, uh..."
00:04:38.695,00:04:40.780,don't eat the food. Dangerous.
00:05:04.804,00:05:06.097,Where's Magnus Bane?
00:05:08.516,00:05:09.684,"Keep moving, warlock."
00:05:11.978,00:05:14.188,"Now, what were you gonna do with that warlock?"
00:05:14.271,00:05:16.065,"Is that part of Valentine's plan now, huh?"
00:05:16.148,00:05:17.942,"Humans, now warlocks?"
00:05:19.861,00:05:21.571,A disgrace to the Circle.
00:05:24.491,00:05:26.368,The only disgrace is that there's a Circle at all.
00:05:27.660,00:05:29.371,But I hear that your membership is dwindling.
00:05:29.454,00:05:31.873,You killed Konrad. I know it.
00:05:31.956,00:05:33.541,I didn't have the pleasure.
00:05:33.625,00:05:36.293,You can blame your allegiance to Valentine for that.
00:05:36.378,00:05:38.546,"Now, let's make a deal."
00:05:38.630,00:05:44.386,"You're gonna tell me some secrets and I'll make sure that you don't end up in the morgue like your boyfriend, Konrad."
00:06:04.363,00:06:05.407,Who is that guy?
00:06:08.242,00:06:11.370,"And, more important for us, a former Circle member."
00:06:11.996,00:06:15.917,"After the uprising, Hodge repented and he was sent to live and work here to make amends."
00:06:16.000,00:06:18.586,But he's forbidden to ever leave the Institute.
00:06:33.435,00:06:34.436,Jocelyn.
00:06:34.519,00:06:36.062,"Uh, I'm Clary."
00:06:36.145,00:06:38.314,"Uh, Jocelyn Fray is my mother."
00:06:38.981,00:06:41.358,"Well, she was Jocelyn Fairchild when I knew her."
00:06:43.445,00:06:44.904,And she was one of my best friends.
00:06:45.863,00:06:47.824,She's been kidnapped...
00:06:47.907,00:06:49.283,by someone named Valentine and his men.
00:06:49.366,00:06:51.160,"By the Circle, Hodge."
00:06:51.243,00:06:53.746,But that's impossible.
00:06:53.830,00:06:55.915,Valentine's dead and the Circle died with him.
00:07:00.044,00:07:02.004,I swore a vow never to speak of what we did.
00:07:03.089,00:07:06.092,This is the Clave's way of making sure I keep that vow.
00:07:06.175,00:07:07.885,"We can't torture him, Jace."
00:07:07.969,00:07:09.762,Is there anyone else we can ask?
00:07:12.306,00:07:13.600,and they've taken Jocelyn...
00:07:21.524,00:07:25.111,"We thought he wanted to protect humans, like all Shadowhunters."
00:07:25.194,00:07:29.741,But we never realized the lengths which Valentine was willing to go...
00:07:29.824,00:07:32.159,the people he was willing to sacrifice.
00:07:34.078,00:07:37.039,Most of humanity would die if we carried out Valentine's plan.
00:07:37.123,00:07:39.751,But I... I still don't understand.
00:07:39.834,00:07:41.544,How does my mother relate to any of this?
00:07:58.936,00:08:00.354,No.
00:08:02.940,00:08:05.151,The important thing is that Jocelyn left the Circle.
00:08:06.360,00:08:10.823,"And so none of this even matters, because Valentine died in a fire years ago."
00:08:13.743,00:08:16.538,"I'm sorry, but we can't ask you to do this."
00:08:16.621,00:08:18.498,"Clary, we don't have a choice."
00:08:24.045,00:08:25.046,is right.
00:08:25.963,00:08:29.592,Valentine nearly destroyed the Shadow World and humanity along with it.
00:08:29.676,00:08:31.803,If he'd gotten the Cup-- Wait a minute.
00:08:31.886,00:08:34.055,My mother told me she hid something from someone.
00:08:34.138,00:08:39.811,"If it's this Cup-- Clary, the Mortal Cup is the most important object in the Shadow World."
00:08:39.894,00:08:42.689,Whoever possesses it can create more Shadowhunters.
00:08:42.772,00:08:44.732,And in the wrong hands...
00:08:44.816,00:08:46.483,control demons.
00:08:49.236,00:08:52.281,then she's in more danger than you can possibly imagine.
00:09:03.543,00:09:04.961,I'm so sorry.
00:09:05.753,00:09:08.172,Your mother was only trying to protect you.
00:09:08.255,00:09:10.675,And now you must protect her.
00:09:12.051,00:09:14.136,Stop Valentine...
00:09:14.220,00:09:16.055,before he destroys us all.
00:09:22.019,00:09:23.062,"Clary, but..."
00:09:23.145,00:09:25.189,"-Clary, look, will you just calm down? -Calm down?"
00:09:25.272,00:09:26.566,"Really, calm down?"
00:09:26.649,00:09:31.028,"Okay, Jace, you might be some kind of emotionless G.I. Joe, but-- What is a G.I. Joe?"
00:09:31.112,00:09:37.577,"A soldier who doesn't understand human emotions, who doesn't know what it's like to lose someone, to lose your own mother."
00:09:37.660,00:09:40.371,You're right. I never knew my mother.
00:09:44.375,00:09:45.585,You don't know anything about this.
00:09:45.668,00:09:47.253,"You don't know about me, you don't know about my life..."
00:09:49.255,00:09:52.091,no training and no plan gets you killed.
00:09:55.136,00:10:00.516,"Okay, so we know that Valentine is back and wants the Cup, and for some reason he thinks my mother has it."
00:10:01.267,00:10:02.268,Could she?
00:10:03.269,00:10:04.646,Have the Cup?
00:10:05.479,00:10:06.563,I don't know.
00:10:06.648,00:10:09.651,"Look, Clary, you know about runes. You've drawn them."
00:10:09.734,00:10:11.527,"You... you know something. Think, please."
00:10:11.611,00:10:15.406,"I've tried, Jace, okay? It's just this empty blackness."
00:10:17.742,00:10:18.951,Your memory's been wiped.
00:10:19.368,00:10:20.745,That's not possible.
00:10:22.579,00:10:25.541,-Is it? -Absolutely... if you know a warlock.
00:10:25.625,00:10:27.710,"-A warlock? -Yeah, a warlock, Clary."
00:10:27.794,00:10:30.337,"Immortal beings, they're half-demon, half-human."
00:10:30.421,00:10:32.006,Sometimes their fingers spark.
00:10:33.090,00:10:39.764,"Dot, my mom's assistant, her hands had this purple glow when she opened the wall and my mom pushed me through and I ended up at the police station."
00:10:39.847,00:10:40.848,That was a Portal.
00:10:40.932,00:10:43.350,Dot must have been a warlock. Only warlocks can create them.
00:10:44.393,00:10:48.940,"Wait, so you're saying if we find the real Dot, she could help us find the Cup and get my mom back?"
00:10:50.232,00:10:51.608,Unless she's working for Valentine.
00:10:52.526,00:10:53.527,Even better.
00:10:53.610,00:10:55.196,She'll lead us right to him.
00:10:56.656,00:10:57.824,Where's Simon?
00:11:25.101,00:11:27.686,Where's Clary? What happened to her?
00:11:27.770,00:11:29.521,We sent her through a Portal to you.
00:11:29.605,00:11:32.358,You sent her through a Portal? Alone?
00:11:32.441,00:11:33.442,She could be in limbo.
00:11:33.525,00:11:35.319,"Well, I didn't have much of a choice."
00:11:40.449,00:11:43.369,Who do you think glamoured the house so that the mundane police wouldn't be alerted?
00:11:43.452,00:11:46.288,Where's Clary? And where's Jocelyn?
00:11:46.372,00:11:48.457,I don't know.
00:11:48.540,00:11:52.169,All I know is that I sent Clary to the police station.
00:11:52.253,00:11:53.254,To you.
00:11:55.840,00:11:58.009,And what exactly are you doing with all that stuff?
00:11:59.969,00:12:01.345,Including you.
00:12:01.428,00:12:02.889,What's that supposed to mean?
00:12:02.972,00:12:06.183,"It means that this stuff is going back to the station with me, where it's safe."
00:12:08.185,00:12:09.645,Where are you going?
00:12:10.479,00:12:13.232,To find Clary. They'll come for her next.
00:12:14.025,00:12:15.943,"If anyone can help, it's Magnus Bane."
00:12:17.779,00:12:19.488,You can't trust anybody.
00:12:19.571,00:12:20.990,You're absolutely right.
00:12:40.009,00:12:43.805,"So, um... what happens to humans if they're..."
00:12:44.847,00:12:45.848,runed?
00:12:47.141,00:12:48.225,They usually die.
00:12:48.309,00:12:50.019,Sometimes they go crazy.
00:12:50.937,00:12:53.189,"When that happens, we call them the Forsaken."
00:12:54.315,00:12:56.400,-Then we kill them. -Right.
00:12:57.693,00:12:59.946,-So the rune on Clary's neck... -A healing rune.
00:13:00.029,00:13:01.697,Jace used it to save her life.
00:13:01.780,00:13:03.991,So Jace knew she was a Shadowhunter?
00:13:04.075,00:13:05.409,He was almost certain.
00:13:08.745,00:13:10.539,Where could you possibly be going?
00:13:10.622,00:13:12.166,"To get Clary, to protect her from Jace."
00:13:12.249,00:13:14.543,And why would she need protection from Jace?
00:13:14.626,00:13:16.045,He's the ultimate protector.
00:13:16.128,00:13:17.880,What makes Jace so special?
00:13:17.964,00:13:20.049,"Fastest, strongest, fiercest."
00:13:21.758,00:13:23.928,"And hello, have you seen the guy?"
00:13:27.306,00:13:29.475,"Rest easy, hombre."
00:13:29.558,00:13:31.185,Clary's in good hands.
00:13:34.480,00:13:36.732,"Mmm, don't worry."
00:13:38.442,00:13:40.069,There's plenty more where that came from.
00:13:42.613,00:13:43.865,Good to know.
00:13:45.532,00:13:46.658,So the Circle...
00:13:47.576,00:13:50.704,"if they're as bad as they say they are, it's not good for Clary, is it?"
00:13:53.875,00:13:55.251,It's not good for any of us.
00:14:32.288,00:14:33.330,What's the story?
00:14:33.414,00:14:34.999,"Uh, the story..."
00:14:35.082,00:14:36.583,-Uh... -With Clary.
00:14:36.667,00:14:38.335,"-How's she doing? -Oh, you talked to Clary?"
00:14:38.419,00:14:40.004,When she stopped by.
00:14:40.087,00:14:41.630,"Oh, she was here?"
00:14:41.713,00:14:43.090,-When? -I don't know.
00:14:43.174,00:14:45.467,"The other day, when you were interviewing those two witnesses."
00:14:47.094,00:14:49.513,"I had so much going on, I had Alaric take her home."
00:14:50.431,00:14:51.765,"But Clary's okay, right?"
00:14:51.848,00:14:53.059,Yeah.
00:14:53.142,00:14:56.562,"She said she was upset about a boy, but my instincts tell me there's more to the story."
00:14:58.105,00:14:59.356,"You know guys that age, they're idiots."
00:15:01.901,00:15:04.778,"Well, some of us transform ourselves and hide the idiot within."
00:15:04.861,00:15:06.072,"Well, if I ever had a daughter..."
00:15:06.822,00:15:08.865,I'd be running a background check on every boy in sight.
00:15:08.950,00:15:11.452,"Ah, that's some sound police work, Captain."
00:15:12.744,00:15:15.289,This is the least revealing thing you have?
00:15:17.416,00:15:19.585,All the naughty bits are covered.
00:15:23.130,00:15:24.631,-Where's Simon? -Who?
00:15:30.554,00:15:32.639,"So, um..."
00:15:32.723,00:15:36.310,"you, Alec, and Jace are... what, like, family?"
00:15:41.941,00:15:43.192,Because you do.
00:15:44.526,00:15:45.527,Don't worry.
00:15:46.946,00:15:49.323,"In every way, he's like my brother."
00:15:49.406,00:15:51.158,Our parents took Jace in when he was ten.
00:15:51.242,00:15:54.536,We trained together. Learned to fight side by side.
00:15:57.331,00:15:58.665,was getting into art school.
00:16:01.877,00:16:05.922,where I give you the pep talk about harnessing your inner Shadowhunter and accepting your true destiny?
00:16:06.007,00:16:07.258,Was that the pep talk?
00:16:14.431,00:16:16.392,"Remember, you were born to do this."
00:16:17.393,00:16:20.104,No matter what has happened...
00:16:20.187,00:16:21.981,this is who you are.
00:16:22.856,00:16:24.316,Not exactly feeling that.
00:16:24.400,00:16:25.484,Yet.
00:16:27.528,00:16:28.862,"Okay, but now we just have to find Dot."
00:16:30.072,00:16:33.867,the most dangerous rogue Shadowhunter in history before he kills us all.
00:16:34.701,00:16:37.621,"You really know how to ruin a pep talk, don't you?"
00:16:37.704,00:16:39.748,"Come on, let's go."
00:16:39.831,00:16:43.127,"Oh, and Simon is kind of nerd-hot."
00:16:50.842,00:16:52.178,-When? -The other day.
00:16:52.261,00:16:54.180,I think she saw me talking to the Circle members.
00:16:54.263,00:16:55.264,What do we do now?
00:16:55.347,00:16:56.682,I got a lead I'm gonna check out.
00:16:56.765,00:16:59.101,You work the Simon Lewis angle.
00:16:59.185,00:17:01.520,"Where Clary goes, Simon's bound to follow."
00:17:01.603,00:17:04.231,"Let's get out of here, just you and me."
00:17:04.315,00:17:05.816,We can get Dot ourselves.
00:17:05.899,00:17:07.526,"Simon, there are demons out there, okay?"
00:17:07.609,00:17:10.112,Actual demons with tentacles that wanna murder us.
00:17:10.196,00:17:11.780,Do you know how to kill a demon?
00:17:13.032,00:17:14.283,I'm an Internet search away.
00:17:14.366,00:17:16.410,"Simon, I really don't think it's that simple."
00:17:21.790,00:17:23.500,"-Whoa. -No, Izzy."
00:17:24.626,00:17:26.670,Fifty bucks says he doesn't approve this mission.
00:17:26.753,00:17:27.838,I don't approve of this mission.
00:17:28.464,00:17:29.673,I spoke with the Clave.
00:17:29.756,00:17:34.010,"They're sending Seelie scouts to search for Valentine, but they made it clear, the little girl does not leave the premises."
00:17:34.095,00:17:35.929,"Hey, my name is not little girl, okay?"
00:17:36.012,00:17:39.558,"I don't care what that Clave thing or you want, I'm going to find Dot."
00:17:39.641,00:17:42.144,"Alec, this warlock could have the answers we need."
00:17:42.228,00:17:45.981,"With Valentine's people out there searching for Clary, she's not safe outside alone."
00:17:46.607,00:17:47.608,Jace has a point.
00:17:47.691,00:17:48.984,"Et tu, Izzy?"
00:17:50.026,00:17:53.072,"All right, since you have all the answers, where do you suggest we search?"
00:17:53.155,00:18:03.999,"We should start at Dot's apartment in Greenpoint, What's wrong? What is it?"
00:18:06.835,00:18:08.712,"Weirdly, I think I know where Dot is."
00:18:08.795,00:18:10.756,Great. I'll drive.
00:18:11.715,00:18:12.716,What?
00:18:12.799,00:18:15.427,"Unless you have, like, a Shadowhunter-mobile or something."
00:18:20.474,00:18:23.894,You were kidding about the runes on the floor killing me... right?
00:18:27.148,00:18:28.190,Possibly.
00:18:31.110,00:18:33.487,Wait... am I gonna die?
00:18:38.909,00:18:41.620,Magnus! Hey.
00:18:41.703,00:18:43.747,Why haven't you answered my messages?
00:18:43.830,00:18:48.502,Jocelyn's missing and I-- I've been a little busy protecting our people from certain death.
00:18:48.585,00:18:49.795,What are you talking about?
00:18:49.878,00:18:52.589,Jocelyn's brilliant plan is screwed.
00:18:52.673,00:18:55.926,Valentine knows a warlock brewed the potion that put her to sleep.
00:18:56.009,00:18:58.929,He's hunting warlocks down one by one.
00:18:59.012,00:19:00.264,"What, so you're leaving?"
00:19:00.347,00:19:02.599,"You've always been the quick study, Dorothy."
00:19:02.683,00:19:05.769,It's our only choice until we know what Valentine is up to.
00:19:05.852,00:19:07.896,"-Let's go. -No, I... I can't."
00:19:07.979,00:19:13.777,I've been Portaling all over the city looking for Clary and my magic is dangerously low. I need your help.
00:19:13.860,00:19:16.572,Are you really going to risk your life for a Shadowhunter?
00:19:19.658,00:19:21.785,"If Valentine gets the Cup, we're all doomed."
00:19:21.868,00:19:23.912,Valentine can't kill what he can't find.
00:19:25.289,00:19:26.832,Last chance to save yourself.
00:20:21.428,00:20:22.554,Dot.
00:20:35.276,00:20:37.528,"Clary, stop! Where are you going?"
00:20:37.611,00:20:39.488,"Two men, Circle members..."
00:20:39.571,00:20:41.573,"the same ones who came to my house, who took my mom."
00:20:41.657,00:20:43.074,They have Dot.
00:20:43.158,00:20:45.619,They're gonna hurt her or kill her. We have to stop them!
00:21:07.308,00:21:08.434,"Now, she's gone."
00:21:08.517,00:21:10.352,"Clary, I'm sorry."
00:21:10.436,00:21:12.313,You don't understand. Dot's like my big sister.
00:21:12.396,00:21:13.605,It's not safe here.
00:21:13.689,00:21:15.482,We have to go back to the Institute right now.
00:21:16.232,00:21:19.445,"So, what now? Valentine has my mom and Dot, and we're just gonna give up?"
00:21:20.446,00:21:22.781,What about my memories? They can't just be gone?
00:21:23.490,00:21:24.491,There is another option.
00:21:24.575,00:21:26.285,-Don't even-- -Absolutely not.
00:21:26.368,00:21:28.244,I'm not afraid of the Silent Brothers.
00:21:28.329,00:21:29.705,Who are the Silent Brothers?
00:21:29.788,00:21:31.748,They're Shadowhunters with superior powers.
00:21:31.832,00:21:33.709,Who possess the ability to recover memories.
00:21:33.792,00:21:36.587,"A process that can also kill you, so there's that."
00:21:36.670,00:21:38.380,Your bedside manner is abysmal.
00:21:39.130,00:21:42.718,We've broken at least 18 Clave rules and now you want to go to the City of Bones?
00:21:42.801,00:21:44.970,There's no way. I won't allow it.
00:21:45.053,00:21:46.513,This isn't our choice to make.
00:21:47.556,00:21:48.849,This is Clary's decision.
00:21:50.851,00:21:53.269,She doesn't know what she's facing.
00:21:53.354,00:21:54.521,She's not prepared.
00:21:54.605,00:21:59.901,"If anyone can tell me another way to recover my memories and still get the answers we need, I'm listening."
00:22:08.494,00:22:09.536,That settles it.
00:22:09.620,00:22:12.664,See? I told you she's one of us.
00:22:38.189,00:22:39.608,Not at all.
00:22:43.529,00:22:45.489,which sounded a lot better in my head.
00:22:54.706,00:22:55.999,Why are we doing this?
00:22:57.125,00:22:58.376,We don't even know these people.
00:22:59.044,00:23:00.086,Hey.
00:23:01.838,00:23:02.881,If something goes wrong...
00:23:03.424,00:23:05.592,"if something happens to her, that's on us."
00:23:05.676,00:23:07.177,"-You know that, don't you? -Yeah."
00:23:07.260,00:23:10.263,And you know exactly what'd happen if Valentine gets the Cup before we do.
00:23:12.015,00:23:13.391,"She's lost everything, Alec."
00:23:14.643,00:23:16.186,I know exactly what that feels like.
00:23:17.896,00:23:20.231,"And what's your problem with her, anyway?"
00:23:20.315,00:23:22.067,Your family always used to welcome strays.
00:23:22.150,00:23:23.902,You were never a stray.
00:23:25.654,00:23:27.614,"The point is, nothing's changed."
00:23:27.698,00:23:29.825,We're in this fight together. There's just...
00:23:30.742,00:23:31.743,one more of us.
00:23:37.749,00:23:38.917,What is it? What's wrong?
00:23:39.835,00:23:42.754,How are you not ultra freaked out by all of this?
00:23:42.838,00:23:45.298,I guess I just always felt like there was something missing.
00:23:46.382,00:23:48.218,Some void I couldn't quite explain.
00:23:49.761,00:23:52.013,Things are finally starting to make sense.
00:23:53.098,00:23:55.809,But none of it's gonna matter unless I get my mom back.
00:23:57.936,00:23:59.187,Then let's do that.
00:24:00.731,00:24:01.815,Clary.
00:24:01.898,00:24:03.984,"-Come on, it's all clear. -Let's go."
00:24:36.057,00:24:39.561,I'd hoped my men could have persuaded you to help us.
00:24:39.645,00:24:43.524,"For someone so old, you're not too wise, are you?"
00:24:44.315,00:24:46.192,"See, it's very simple."
00:24:47.653,00:24:51.447,Reverse Jocelyn's spell and you'll be free to live your...
00:24:52.282,00:24:55.035,"wasteful, warlock life."
00:24:59.164,00:25:01.792,You'd never let me go.
00:25:05.796,00:25:07.297,I can't break the spell.
00:25:08.924,00:25:10.383,Who did it then?
00:25:17.683,00:25:19.893,I want the warlock's name.
00:25:22.228,00:25:25.398,"See, Jocelyn may be unreachable, but her daughter is still out there."
00:25:26.567,00:25:28.819,"You must want to help the girl, right?"
00:25:33.740,00:25:37.243,Maybe a little medicine...
00:25:37.327,00:25:39.454,"will trigger your memory, hmm?"
00:25:53.844,00:25:56.554,They lack your charm and superior people skills?
00:25:56.638,00:25:58.056,"Yeah, most people do."
00:25:59.349,00:26:03.394,"Brothers communicate without using words, using just their thoughts."
00:26:03.478,00:26:05.188,That doesn't sound so bad.
00:26:05.271,00:26:07.608,Don't let their silence fool you.
00:26:07.691,00:26:13.446,"They'll hold the Soul-Sword to your head, and with its blade, carve the truth from your mind."
00:26:13.529,00:26:15.406,"If you're not strong enough, you will die."
00:26:16.491,00:26:18.702,I take it back. That sounds level ten bad.
00:26:18.785,00:26:23.289,"Clary, you should know, the pain will be excruciating. You don't have to-- I'll do anything."
00:26:24.332,00:26:27.543,"Walk through fire, battle demons, whatever it takes."
00:26:28.503,00:26:30.046,I have to get my mom back.
00:26:30.130,00:26:32.841,I can't... I won't lose her.
00:26:33.466,00:26:34.509,You won't.
00:26:35.426,00:26:36.552,We won't.
00:26:51.317,00:26:53.569,You're Clary freakin' Fray. You can do anything.
00:26:56.072,00:26:57.532,"All right, hold up."
00:26:57.615,00:26:58.867,"Surprise, surprise."
00:26:58.950,00:27:01.870,"No mundanes allowed, just like in the training room, right? Wrong!"
00:27:01.953,00:27:06.124,I've seen every horror movie ever made and the funny best friend who gets left behind...
00:27:06.207,00:27:07.208,dead man.
00:27:10.336,00:27:11.797,"But by all means, go ahead."
00:27:14.465,00:27:16.509,"Of course, the minute you enter, you'll die."
00:27:17.803,00:27:19.512,"Problem is, now I don't trust you."
00:27:19.595,00:27:21.848,-He's not lying. -Now.
00:27:21.932,00:27:23.224,He was before.
00:27:25.018,00:27:27.896,"any mundane who dares to enter, so, please..."
00:27:30.565,00:27:32.233,I'll mind the mundane.
00:27:35.236,00:27:37.072,I'm missing a financial analysis class.
00:27:42.869,00:27:44.204,I don't wanna leave you.
00:27:44.287,00:27:47.248,"Go be a badass Shadowhunter, all right?"
00:27:47.332,00:27:48.917,"Get your memories back, save your mother."
00:27:49.000,00:27:50.752,I'll be right here...
00:27:55.924,00:27:57.884,"Clary, you don't keep the Silent Brothers waiting."
00:27:59.344,00:28:00.511,You got this.
00:28:06.059,00:28:08.019,They're getting to be quite the team.
00:28:08.103,00:28:09.813,Amusing.
00:28:09.896,00:28:11.898,"No, not really."
00:28:22.117,00:28:24.202,Got this from the shift commander.
00:28:24.285,00:28:27.455,One of your witnesses turned up dead outside an abandoned church.
00:28:27.538,00:28:28.790,Then there's this.
00:28:31.334,00:28:33.169,winds up dead inside a parking garage.
00:28:33.253,00:28:37.673,"Look, I don't know what tore into this woman, and I really don't know what happened to that car."
00:28:38.508,00:28:41.177,Looks like the demonic murder crew's taking out their witnesses one by one.
00:28:41.261,00:28:42.470,You sure that's all it is?
00:28:43.554,00:28:46.182,"Oh, come on, Captain. You've got no reason to doubt me."
00:28:47.893,00:28:48.935,Don't give me one.
00:28:56.860,00:28:58.319,You're supposed to stay under the radar.
00:28:58.403,00:29:00.030,It was self-defense.
00:29:00.113,00:29:02.198,-You know I'm on the right side of things. -I know that.
00:29:02.282,00:29:04.700,I'm not sure our friends agree.
00:29:04.785,00:29:08.038,"If you wanna smooth things over, I suggest you find Clary soon..."
00:29:08.121,00:29:09.664,or they will.
00:29:10.290,00:29:11.541,I will.
00:29:11.624,00:29:13.126,No one knows her better than I do.
00:29:50.997,00:29:55.043,We carry it to remind us that light can be found in even the darkest of places.
00:29:59.547,00:30:00.673,Here.
00:30:16.189,00:30:18.399,It's the Shadowhunter creed.
00:30:18.483,00:30:21.277,Looking better in black than the widows of our enemies.
00:30:22.904,00:30:26.699,"My Latin's pretty rusty, but I'm almost positive that's not what that says."
00:30:29.327,00:30:32.747,"For Shadowhunters, the descent into hell is easy."
00:30:38.669,00:30:39.670,It's this way.
00:30:54.810,00:30:55.896,I'm sorry...
00:30:55.979,00:30:59.274,about what I said before about your mom. I didn't know.
00:31:00.191,00:31:02.110,It's cute. You assume I have feelings.
00:31:03.028,00:31:04.029,I don't.
00:31:05.280,00:31:07.157,Save the apologies for the mundanes.
00:31:07.240,00:31:10.410,Everyone has a sad song. My mother died when I was a baby.
00:31:10.493,00:31:12.578,-My father died when I was ten. -I'm so sorry.
00:31:14.330,00:31:17.792,"Wait, is he... is he buried here?"
00:31:19.627,00:31:20.879,No.
00:31:22.380,00:31:24.465,Circle members are considered traitors.
00:31:25.425,00:31:26.842,They forfeit their right to be buried here.
00:31:26.927,00:31:29.012,"Your dad was in the Circle, too?"
00:31:29.095,00:31:33.599,My father tried to do the right thing and leave the Circle and it cost him his life.
00:31:35.977,00:31:39.647,"That's why you're doing all this, why you're helping me."
00:31:41.232,00:31:43.985,Valentine and his people need to pay.
00:31:44.069,00:31:45.361,I'm gonna make them pay.
00:31:47.948,00:31:50.658,"For, um... for what it's worth..."
00:31:51.492,00:31:53.286,I'm still sorry.
00:31:54.537,00:31:57.123,No more I'm sorry's.
00:31:57.207,00:31:58.749,You're a Shadowhunter now.
00:32:16.517,00:32:17.893,But I don't know what it means.
00:32:17.978,00:32:19.687,It means clairvoyance.
00:32:56.391,00:32:58.684,"Step away, Jace Wayland."
00:32:59.935,00:33:01.271,I'll be right here.
00:33:05.984,00:33:07.402,is a perilous one.
00:33:07.485,00:33:12.115,Please... my memories were blocked. I have to get them back.
00:33:12.198,00:33:14.325,If you are not strong enough...
00:33:14.409,00:33:17.662,the Soul-Sword will kill you.
00:33:21.166,00:33:23.168,You're more powerful than you know.
00:33:23.251,00:33:24.752,"Clary freakin' Fray, you can do anything."
00:33:24.835,00:33:26.462,Remember you were born to do this.
00:33:26.546,00:33:28.798,You're one of us. You're a Shadowhunter.
00:33:30.675,00:33:31.759,I'm ready.
00:33:35.055,00:33:37.890,"So, is cracking someone's mind open supposed to take this long?"
00:33:37.973,00:33:40.976,"Maybe we, or... you should go check?"
00:33:43.979,00:33:46.816,The Silent Brothers are quite unpleasant.
00:33:47.858,00:33:49.735,That's not helping. Not at all.
00:33:50.945,00:33:52.363,What if Clary can't handle the Brothers?
00:33:57.827,00:33:59.745,Heavy is the head that wears the crown.
00:33:59.829,00:34:03.458,Mmm. I feel his pain. Only son.
00:34:08.379,00:34:11.924,-And you? What do you want? -Me?
00:34:12.883,00:34:16.471,"-Um... well, I'm in a band. -Yeah?"
00:34:16.554,00:34:18.473,What type of music?
00:34:18.556,00:34:20.308,Let me guess.
00:34:24.520,00:34:26.939,I do. We recorded our last set. We killed. It's...
00:34:32.445,00:34:34.322,-Yeah. -Yeah.
00:34:36.282,00:34:37.575,We'll be right back.
00:34:38.284,00:34:39.410,What?
00:34:40.203,00:34:41.912,He passes the time.
00:34:51.089,00:34:52.590,Just a second.
00:34:52.673,00:34:56.136,"-Yeah? -Um, uh, trying to pick the right clip."
00:34:59.555,00:35:01.724,"I'll be right back. Whatever you do, do not leave the van."
00:35:01.807,00:35:03.226,"Got it, yeah."
00:35:46.060,00:35:47.102,Really?
00:35:48.479,00:35:49.522,Huh.
00:35:51.691,00:35:52.817,"Simon, I gotta go."
00:35:53.943,00:35:55.361,Luke... no.
00:35:55.445,00:35:57.280,All this lying is destroying you.
00:35:57.363,00:35:58.989,Stop blocking her memory and tell her the truth.
00:35:59.073,00:36:01.451,I can't. You know I can't.
00:36:03.828,00:36:06.539,Clary's a Shadowhunter. There's nothing you can do to change that.
00:36:07.623,00:36:09.083,This world is too dangerous.
00:36:09.959,00:36:13.879,"If anyone knew who she really was, the risks would be a hundred times greater."
00:36:16.632,00:36:19.009,-And then what? -I won't let that happen.
00:36:21.596,00:36:23.764,If she ever learns about her father...
00:36:24.432,00:36:26.767,if she ever finds out that her father is Valentine.
00:36:29.770,00:36:32.064,"Wait... Wait, where are they going?"
00:36:34.024,00:36:36.777,"-Clary, do you know where the Cup is? -No."
00:36:40.281,00:36:43.075,It can't be true... what I saw.
00:36:45.495,00:36:47.788,You must accept what has been revealed.
00:36:50.250,00:36:52.210,What is it? What did you see?
00:36:53.127,00:36:54.629,My mother lied to me.
00:36:55.296,00:36:57.257,She lied all these years about my father.
00:36:57.340,00:36:59.384,About your father? What about your father?
00:37:00.301,00:37:01.594,My father...
00:37:03.554,00:37:05.348,My father is Valentine.
00:37:27.036,00:37:28.037,Ah!
00:37:58.192,00:38:00.235,Clary is fine.
00:38:01.195,00:38:03.155,She's so brave...
00:38:04.365,00:38:05.533,and strong.
00:38:07.452,00:38:10.245,And she won't...
00:38:10.330,00:38:12.457,Clary won't let Valentine win.
00:38:15.167,00:38:16.544,I'm so sorry.
00:38:20.840,00:38:22.883,"Magic a little rusty, warlock?"
00:38:22.967,00:38:25.386,Should've learned how to fight like the rest of us!
00:38:26.053,00:38:27.137,Ahh!
00:38:45.573,00:38:47.032,You were a loyal follower.
00:38:51.704,00:38:53.748,I won't forget your sacrifice.
00:39:12.683,00:39:14.852,I was never gonna let you go.
00:39:24.362,00:39:26.196,What happened? What did you find out?
00:39:26.947,00:39:29.033,Valentine is Clary's father.
00:39:30.451,00:39:31.452,Wait a minute.
00:39:31.536,00:39:34.997,You're telling me this girl shows up out of nowhere and she's Valentine's daughter?
00:39:35.080,00:39:36.582,Did it occur to you that she might be a spy?
00:39:36.666,00:39:38.751,"-This might be part of her plan? -That's enough, Alec."
00:39:38.834,00:39:40.545,Do you think I planned for my mom to get kidnapped?
00:39:40.628,00:39:42.129,Or... or for Dot to be taken?
00:39:42.212,00:39:47.217,Or to have a giant sword dangle over my head and find out that my father is one of the most dangerous people in the world?
00:39:47.301,00:39:48.636,Really?
00:39:50.971,00:39:52.264,Where's Simon?
00:39:53.015,00:39:54.224,Where's Simon?
00:39:54.308,00:39:55.435,I told him to stay in the van.
00:39:55.518,00:39:57.895,-I've searched everywhere. -He's gone?
00:39:59.522,00:40:01.231,You were supposed to protect him!
00:40:17.582,00:40:18.999,to kill you unless you return him.
00:40:19.083,00:40:21.711,Careful. We'd be violating the Accords.
00:40:24.755,00:40:27.842,The Night Children have broken no laws. We're negotiating.
00:40:28.426,00:40:32.472,"The mundane, unharmed, in exchange for the Mortal Cup."
00:40:34.724,00:40:36.308,And the clock is ticking.
00:40:36.391,00:40:38.143,"Tick-tock, people."
00:40:45.025,00:40:46.944,Simon! Simon!
00:00:12.554,00:00:14.306,My mother told me she hid something from someone.
00:00:14.389,00:00:17.267,The Mortal Cup is the most important object in the Shadow World.
00:00:19.102,00:00:21.938,And you know exactly what'd happen if Valentine gets the cup before we do.
00:00:22.439,00:00:26.401,Maybe a little medicine will trigger your memory.
00:00:27.319,00:00:29.779,-I suggest you find Clary soon. -I will.
00:00:29.862,00:00:33.658,"If anyone can tell me another way to recover my memories, I'm listening."
00:00:33.741,00:00:36.411,"If they're as bad as they say they are, it's not good for Clary, is it?"
00:00:36.494,00:00:37.912,It's not good for any of us.
00:00:38.996,00:00:40.790,I've drawn this before. But I don't know what it means.
00:00:42.125,00:00:45.545,We're negotiating. The mundane in exchange for the Mortal Cup.
00:00:48.215,00:00:49.966,My father is Valentine.
00:00:53.553,00:00:56.223,I still don't understand. How can Shadowhunters be better than...
00:00:56.306,00:00:57.724,than what you people call mundanes?
00:00:57.807,00:00:59.434,Because we protect humans.
00:01:02.437,00:01:04.981,Humans. You protect humans.
00:01:05.065,00:01:08.025,You left Simon all alone in the van.
00:01:08.110,00:01:09.361,"Great job, guys. You rock."
00:01:09.444,00:01:14.741,"There is some truth to the idea that human beings should have Alec, not now."
00:01:14.824,00:01:18.120,"Look, they won't do anything to Simon. They just wanted to draw you out."
00:01:18.203,00:01:19.746,"They want the Cup, and they think you have it."
00:01:19.829,00:01:21.623,But why do they think that? Why does anyone think that?
00:01:21.706,00:01:27.837,"What, my mom lies to me my entire life except, Oh, by the way, there's this magic cup, I hid on, like, the planet Bongo, but don't tell anyone."
00:01:32.217,00:01:34.010,-We have to report to the Clave. -Great.
00:01:34.093,00:01:36.138,They have to know we've learned about Valentine.
00:01:36.221,00:01:37.514,"What, that he's my father?"
00:01:38.515,00:01:39.974,Great. Fine. Tell them.
00:01:40.057,00:01:41.976,What good does that do Simon?
00:01:42.059,00:01:44.437,"Clary, it's all connected. The vamps want the Cup."
00:01:44.521,00:01:45.772,Why? It makes new Shadowhunters.
00:01:45.855,00:01:48.400,Nobody wants Valentine forming an army loyal to himself.
00:01:48.483,00:01:50.360,"Plus, it controls demons."
00:01:51.027,00:01:53.655,They'll propose a trade. Simon for the Cup.
00:01:53.738,00:01:57.409,"So, vampires will trade Simon for the Cup and Valentine will trade my mother for the Cup."
00:01:58.326,00:01:59.869,"Either way, I lose someone I love."
00:02:01.829,00:02:05.082,What if I just toss it up in the air and let them fight it out among themselves?
00:02:05.167,00:02:08.211,"-So this doesn't matter to you? -Yes, of course, it matters!"
00:02:10.588,00:02:14.091,Listen... when you saved my life...
00:02:14.176,00:02:15.760,I put my trust in you.
00:02:17.387,00:02:19.722,"Now, I need you to put your trust in me."
00:02:20.765,00:02:22.725,I can't turn into what you are overnight.
00:02:22.809,00:02:24.769,It's true. She was raised as a mundane.
00:02:24.852,00:02:26.396,"What are you, her spokesman now?"
00:02:26.479,00:02:28.898,"I don't need a spokesman, I need a plan."
00:02:34.070,00:02:37.282,I'm just an accounting student. I have no value to anyone.
00:02:40.368,00:02:43.371,"so if you let me go, I couldn't even identify you."
00:02:43.455,00:02:46.123,"Not that I would, 'cause you guys are vampires!"
00:02:46.208,00:02:47.834,Who would believe me?
00:02:47.917,00:02:50.086,I didn't even know you guys existed until yesterday!
00:02:52.547,00:02:53.881,Is anyone there?
00:02:56.718,00:02:59.971,"If your goal was to scare the crap out of me, mission accomplished!"
00:03:01.306,00:03:02.474,And as far as I'm concerned...
00:03:04.976,00:03:06.353,"Especially, the blonde one."
00:03:07.979,00:03:09.606,"You know, you don't need me."
00:03:09.689,00:03:12.149,"On the contrary, I do."
00:03:19.156,00:03:21.243,"I mean, can any of this help me find Simon?"
00:03:22.827,00:03:25.622,"Where is he, anyway? Some kind of crypt in Transylvania?"
00:03:25.705,00:03:27.624,"Actually, no. That was Camille's outfit, right?"
00:03:27.707,00:03:28.750,They're locals.
00:03:28.833,00:03:30.627,"They're at the Hotel DuMort, down in Gansevoort Street."
00:03:30.710,00:03:32.920,And we came back here? Why? We have to go there.
00:03:33.004,00:03:35.465,"-Let's go, now. Come on. -We need a Clave resolution for that."
00:03:35.548,00:03:38.593,The four of us can't declare war on the vamps all by ourselves.
00:03:38.676,00:03:41.178,And we can't react without considering our options.
00:03:41.263,00:03:44.224,Downworlders are slaves to their impulses. We're not.
00:03:44.307,00:03:46.226,"Alec, you can't stomp on all the Downworlders."
00:03:46.309,00:03:48.811,"Oh, that's right. Seelies have their charms, apparently."
00:03:48.895,00:03:50.397,-Right? -Seelies?
00:03:50.480,00:03:52.315,Like faeries. The Fair Folk.
00:03:52.399,00:03:55.735,"Add pixies, nixies, elves... anybody half-angel, half-demon."
00:03:55.818,00:03:58.029,It's pretty much a catch-all term.
00:03:58.112,00:04:00.823,Izzy can tell you all about them. She's got a thing.
00:04:01.324,00:04:04.244,"We've all got our things, don't we?"
00:04:04.327,00:04:07.497,"Okay, I can't listen to this. Simon's been kidnapped by vampires."
00:04:07.580,00:04:09.749,I guess I'll just take care of it myself.
00:04:09.832,00:04:10.917,"Clary, you're gonna get yourself killed."
00:04:11.459,00:04:13.628,"Clary. Simon, too."
00:04:18.215,00:04:19.216,Then help me.
00:04:19.301,00:04:22.762,"While we consider other options, my best friend is suffering."
00:04:23.596,00:04:26.974,Is that something Shadowhunters understand or am I just being a mundane?
00:04:32.480,00:04:34.106,Clary's right.
00:04:36.484,00:04:37.902,They made the first move.
00:04:37.985,00:04:39.987,"We're gonna take care of this ourselves, right now."
00:04:40.071,00:04:42.574,"-This is a bad idea. I-- -What, have you got a better one?"
00:04:43.783,00:04:45.952,"Look, the vamps broke the Accords."
00:04:46.035,00:04:47.745,They kidnapped a mundie. That's a big no-no.
00:04:47.829,00:04:50.832,The Clave will give us a lecture and then they'll be glad we did it.
00:04:50.915,00:04:52.792,-Come on. -Hard to argue with that.
00:04:52.875,00:04:57.964,"Even if we went ahead, I don't see how we get out of here without having to explain where we're going."
00:04:58.047,00:05:00.592,"We need weapons, and we can't let anyone see us get them."
00:05:03.135,00:05:04.679,I know where to get what we need.
00:05:16.858,00:05:19.068,"Do I, uh... do I get out of here or what?"
00:05:19.151,00:05:21.112,The answer to that is above my paygrade.
00:05:21.195,00:05:23.823,Paygrade? They... they pay vampires?
00:05:23.906,00:05:26.784,Let's just say we invest early and often.
00:05:31.163,00:05:32.248,Why won't you sit?
00:05:34.792,00:05:36.628,I really hate fidgeting.
00:05:36.711,00:05:38.880,"-I'm just, uh... just looking. -For a way out?"
00:05:41.591,00:05:42.634,There isn't one.
00:05:45.261,00:05:46.388,Steal.
00:05:49.807,00:05:51.601,It's-- Whatever.
00:05:51.684,00:05:54.896,Leonidas I has been trying to peddle that junk for years.
00:05:56.439,00:06:00.317,Museums make you prove antiquities are legit these days.
00:06:00.402,00:06:02.153,"Yeah, naturally."
00:06:20.922,00:06:23.007,"Honestly, I just got this jacket."
00:06:23.966,00:06:27.720,"There's no way out. You're a hostage, so accept it."
00:06:27.804,00:06:29.013,I'm a hostage?
00:06:30.056,00:06:31.348,"That means you won't kill me, yeah?"
00:06:34.936,00:06:36.228,Who said that?
00:06:41.526,00:06:42.527,"Oh, look."
00:06:44.111,00:06:45.447,How sweet.
00:06:46.405,00:06:48.157,You're bleeding.
00:06:54.872,00:06:58.125,I am so looking forward to getting to know you.
00:07:15.602,00:07:16.769,Whose grave is it?
00:07:20.397,00:07:22.775,"Died, January 10th, 1878."
00:07:22.859,00:07:25.445,"-All right, Alec, let's go. -Wait, what are we looking for?"
00:07:25.528,00:07:28.531,-Cache of weapons. -Stashed here with Mrs. Milligan.
00:07:28.615,00:07:30.617,Why are there Shadowhunter weapons in a churchyard?
00:07:30.700,00:07:33.536,Because all of the ancient religions recognize demons.
00:07:33.620,00:07:35.121,Or at least they used to.
00:07:35.204,00:07:37.790,They forgot about the threat because we've been here to protect them.
00:07:39.083,00:07:43.796,-Typical mundane failure of imagination. -Are you saying we did too good a job?
00:07:46.466,00:07:48.342,"Alec, why don't you go check out by the angel?"
00:07:51.971,00:07:56.851,"We couldn't gear up at the Institute, but we know our ancestors left a cache around here someplace."
00:07:56.934,00:07:58.728,We'll find it.
00:07:58.811,00:08:01.313,I always wondered where my dad was buried.
00:08:05.985,00:08:07.904,Be careful what you wish for.
00:08:08.488,00:08:09.864,This isn't your fault.
00:08:10.657,00:08:12.199,This is all my fault.
00:08:14.952,00:08:17.163,He's home. I'm outta here.
00:08:18.289,00:08:19.373,"Wait, aren't you coming with us?"
00:08:19.456,00:08:23.127,"Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world, but I gotta find out how to get into the vampires' lair."
00:08:25.421,00:08:27.131,Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
00:08:27.632,00:08:30.301,Jace... over here.
00:08:30.384,00:08:31.594,"Yeah, coming."
00:08:32.554,00:08:34.430,"-Are you gonna be all right? -Yeah. Yeah, I'll be fine."
00:08:34.514,00:08:35.557,"I'm just, um..."
00:08:37.141,00:08:38.935,"Just give me a minute, okay?"
00:08:39.561,00:08:41.145,Okay.
00:08:51.739,00:08:54.283,We're crossing a line into vamp territory.
00:08:54.366,00:08:55.952,That's the point.
00:08:56.035,00:08:57.411,"Come on, Alec, cheer up. It's going to be fun."
00:08:57.494,00:09:00.164,"Damn it, Jace, just... think this through."
00:09:00.790,00:09:02.458,You don't even like this guy.
00:09:02.542,00:09:05.461,"This isn't about the mundane, this is about Clary."
00:09:07.004,00:09:09.381,"What, are you so desperate to get laid that you'll risk killing us?"
00:09:09.465,00:09:13.803,"Wow, um, there's so much in that that was wrong, I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear it."
00:09:13.886,00:09:17.431,That's the problem. You're not listening.
00:09:17.514,00:09:19.767,Not to this or anything else I've said tonight.
00:09:19.851,00:09:23.020,You don't even know this girl. Why do you trust her?
00:09:23.896,00:09:25.648,Is this about her being Valentine's daughter?
00:09:25.732,00:09:29.151,"Haven't we been through this? Alec, look at me."
00:09:29.235,00:09:32.404,"You can trust her, or not. I don't care. That's not my business."
00:09:36.283,00:09:38.244,Mary Milligan!
00:09:47.461,00:09:48.713,Beloved servant?
00:09:50.006,00:09:51.215,Who wants that on a headstone?
00:09:51.298,00:09:54.260,Someone who is in service to a cause greater than themselves.
00:09:57.597,00:09:59.015,At least she is now.
00:10:00.432,00:10:01.558,Abracadabra.
00:10:01.643,00:10:05.187,"-Wait, you people actually say that? -No, Clary, we don't."
00:10:28.795,00:10:31.172,Whoa! Where's Mrs. Milligan?
00:10:32.924,00:10:36.010,Don't touch that. You don't know how to use it.
00:10:36.093,00:10:38.805,"What, like at Pandemonium when I killed that demon?"
00:10:38.888,00:10:39.889,-You didn't kill-- -Alec.
00:10:39.972,00:10:41.849,I'm gonna show her the right way to use it.
00:10:46.145,00:10:50.232,No. There's no bow here. I need one.
00:10:50.817,00:10:52.860,I have to rune some arrows. That's back at the Institute.
00:10:52.944,00:10:54.195,I gotta go.
00:10:54.278,00:10:56.530,"Well, how are you gonna get back in the Institute?"
00:10:57.573,00:11:00.326,Go in the back. Won't bother me if I'm alone.
00:11:01.452,00:11:02.536,"Okay, good. Go."
00:11:03.454,00:11:04.747,I can finish up here.
00:11:12.046,00:11:13.255,I understand what we need to do.
00:11:13.339,00:11:16.843,"And I trust you, parabatai..."
00:11:16.926,00:11:18.928,but don't ever doubt me.
00:11:19.011,00:11:20.304,No matter what I said.
00:11:21.013,00:11:22.264,It's already forgotten.
00:11:24.183,00:11:26.602,-I'll see you at dawn. -At dawn.
00:11:36.112,00:11:39.866,"Now, it knows you're a Shadowhunter, so it wants to respond."
00:11:39.949,00:11:43.035,But you have to be firm with it. Let it know who's boss.
00:11:47.248,00:11:48.624,There.
00:11:49.834,00:11:53.670,You make it a part of yourself and it a part of you.
00:11:54.588,00:11:56.883,"Now, the blade never dims."
00:11:57.967,00:11:59.510,It's saying you belong together.
00:12:01.262,00:12:02.513,How does it know?
00:12:03.890,00:12:05.474,"'Cause you're part angel, Clary..."
00:12:06.392,00:12:07.977,like all Shadowhunters.
00:12:13.440,00:12:14.817,You understand?
00:12:15.818,00:12:17.444,Not even a little.
00:12:18.570,00:12:19.696,You'll get there.
00:12:20.739,00:12:23.617,It's not something you understand in your mind.
00:12:24.285,00:12:27.538,It's something you know because it's pulsing through your body.
00:12:29.623,00:12:30.917,It's in your blood.
00:12:35.797,00:12:37.631,Could I even do this without you?
00:12:38.757,00:12:39.884,You just did.
00:12:39.967,00:12:43.637,But it... felt like you were still with me.
00:12:46.098,00:12:47.099,I am.
00:12:48.434,00:12:49.726,I will be.
00:12:53.397,00:12:57.068,We... we will be... there for you.
00:13:03.825,00:13:06.285,-How do you know they'll come back? -Who? Alec and Izzy?
00:13:06.368,00:13:07.870,-Yeah. -We were raised together.
00:13:07.954,00:13:09.538,They're basically my brother and sister.
00:13:10.331,00:13:13.584,"-You know Alec doesn't like me, right? -Alec doesn't like anybody."
00:13:13.667,00:13:15.920,-Why would he help me? -Did you hear what he called me just then?
00:13:16.003,00:13:17.421,We're parabatai.
00:13:23.427,00:13:26.848,There's no human bond that compares to what Alec and I have.
00:13:26.931,00:13:28.099,We're bound together for life.
00:13:28.182,00:13:31.352,"Bound to fight together, to protect each other."
00:13:31.853,00:13:34.688,"In battle, our hearts beat as one."
00:13:36.273,00:13:38.275,If one of us were to die...
00:13:38.359,00:13:40.694,a part of the other would die inside as well.
00:13:48.619,00:13:49.745,Are you ready?
00:13:50.579,00:13:52.748,-I'm ready. -You look ready.
00:13:56.627,00:13:57.628,I hate throwing things.
00:13:59.630,00:14:02.841,"Even at my own Bar Mitzvah, I wouldn't throw spitballs at a gray table. I mean..."
00:14:02.925,00:14:05.219,"I would never throw things, honest to God!"
00:14:05.302,00:14:06.553,"Oh, God. You guys can't say God, right?"
00:14:06.637,00:14:08.472,"For God's sake, what are you trying to say?"
00:14:08.555,00:14:10.141,I didn't... I didn't mean to throw that thing.
00:14:10.224,00:14:13.310,"Of course you did, darling. That's what makes you so amusing."
00:14:13.394,00:14:15.396,I don't find any of this amusing.
00:14:20.026,00:14:22.819,Thank you. The living are so exhausting.
00:14:22.904,00:14:25.614,-But this one will be useful. -I don't know.
00:14:27.909,00:14:30.452,I'm not sure breaking the Accords was the best idea.
00:14:31.787,00:14:34.874,"-If you'll forgive me for saying so. -I'll forgive, but I won't agree."
00:14:34.957,00:14:38.878,You know as well as I do Clary Fairchild will come after her dearest friend...
00:14:38.961,00:14:40.922,or whatever he is.
00:14:41.005,00:14:42.924,All we have to do is take her.
00:14:43.007,00:14:45.676,Either she has the Cup or we'll make her tell us where it is.
00:14:45.759,00:14:47.803,She'll bring those Shadowhunters with her.
00:14:47.887,00:14:49.430,They won't get past the front door.
00:14:50.056,00:14:52.516,"Even if they do, we've got them vastly outnumbered."
00:14:54.268,00:14:56.395,Have you ever tasted Shadowhunter blood?
00:14:59.690,00:15:02.276,I wouldn't know. Let's stick to the subject.
00:15:02.359,00:15:04.987,Isn't this the wrong time to be antagonizing the Clave?
00:15:05.071,00:15:08.032,They're our best hope if Valentine really does make a comeback.
00:15:08.115,00:15:09.783,How much longer have I been at this than you?
00:15:09.866,00:15:12.328,"-Three, four-hundred-- -You weren't supposed to answer that."
00:15:13.079,00:15:17.291,"Suffice to say, she who controls the Mortal Cup, controls the Shadow World."
00:15:23.255,00:15:25.174,He's a tasty little morsel.
00:15:26.133,00:15:29.011,"-Don't you think? -Camille, him?"
00:15:29.095,00:15:30.429,Remember chocolates?
00:15:31.931,00:15:36.685,Sometimes the plainest candy shell has the tastiest center.
00:15:40.982,00:15:42.816,We'll see.
00:15:46.362,00:15:49.448,...so I'd be happy to pay for a whole new jacket.
00:15:54.786,00:15:56.622,"Don't worry, my little caramel."
00:15:57.456,00:16:00.126,Everything will be just fine.
00:16:09.218,00:16:10.261,Meliorn?
00:16:14.431,00:16:15.724,Isabelle.
00:16:20.021,00:16:21.147,Have you missed me?
00:16:21.688,00:16:22.939,You know I have.
00:16:28.862,00:16:30.656,I thought you'd be busy tonight.
00:16:34.118,00:16:36.453,The only thing I have to do is you.
00:16:40.332,00:16:41.458,Really?
00:16:44.336,00:16:47.089,Why aren't you all out looking for Valentine's daughter?
00:16:47.173,00:16:48.840,We're not looking.
00:16:55.597,00:16:57.058,That's not an answer.
00:17:00.561,00:17:01.937,Is this?
00:17:03.355,00:17:06.233,"No, but it's clear enough."
00:17:07.943,00:17:10.779,-Does she have the Mortal Cup? -Who?
00:17:10.862,00:17:12.239,Jocelyn's daughter.
00:17:12.323,00:17:15.909,"Meliorn, are you trying to get information out of me?"
00:17:25.211,00:17:27.338,And if I had some questions for you?
00:17:27.421,00:17:28.505,I'd have to answer.
00:17:29.298,00:17:30.424,You know that.
00:17:34.470,00:17:37.013,Seelies can't lie.
00:17:37.098,00:17:40.559,-But they can evade. -And distract.
00:17:43.354,00:17:46.857,"Yes, they certainly can."
00:18:16.052,00:18:17.888,We can't move on the vamps until sunrise.
00:18:17.971,00:18:20.391,"Plus, there's something I need in here."
00:18:24.103,00:18:27.106,"We need to save Simon, not hang around a bunch of posers."
00:18:29.483,00:18:30.734,"Jace, it's not funny."
00:18:31.985,00:18:34.696,Shouldn't you be teaching me to fight vampires or something?
00:18:35.906,00:18:37.199,Do me a favor.
00:18:38.325,00:18:40.411,Look over there. What do you see?
00:18:43.830,00:18:45.832,"Waitress, people making out."
00:18:48.710,00:18:50.587,"Now, concentrate on seeing through."
00:18:51.963,00:18:53.340,Through?
00:18:53.424,00:18:56.593,There are layers to reality. You can peel them away.
00:18:56.677,00:18:58.512,See the Shadow World.
00:19:00.806,00:19:03.475,-Maybe you can. -Don't just use your mind.
00:19:04.393,00:19:05.644,Use your whole self.
00:19:06.687,00:19:07.854,Relax into it.
00:19:16.238,00:19:17.448,"Oh, my God."
00:19:18.824,00:19:20.284,They're vampires.
00:19:30.001,00:19:33.004,Check out that guy. He's got something.
00:19:33.088,00:19:35.090,"-What? Fleas? -Now, now."
00:19:35.174,00:19:36.633,Here you go.
00:19:36.717,00:19:40.304,-Bet you can't handle his charm. -Charm? Are you kidding me?
00:19:43.056,00:19:45.559,"Go on, go compliment him on his motorcycle."
00:19:47.060,00:19:48.395,They like that.
00:19:52.524,00:19:53.859,Hi.
00:19:55.777,00:19:58.947,I've been wondering who owns this awesome bike.
00:19:59.030,00:20:00.574,"Well, hey, baby."
00:20:01.533,00:20:02.743,You like to ride?
00:20:21.928,00:20:24.598,"You know you smell like a friggin' angel, right?"
00:20:24.681,00:20:27.976,But without all that Shadowhunter rune crap all over you.
00:20:30.229,00:20:31.605,"Much better look, right?"
00:20:33.982,00:20:37.403,"I don't know what the hell you are, angel doll, but you're one tasty treat."
00:20:39.280,00:20:40.489,Thank you.
00:21:02.386,00:21:05.221,-Would you like to help me? -Yes.
00:21:05.722,00:21:07.015,Anything.
00:21:11.312,00:21:14.690,Could you tell me where to find the Mortal Cup?
00:21:14.773,00:21:16.191,I wish I could...
00:21:17.233,00:21:18.485,but I don't know.
00:21:36.295,00:21:38.254,What if she didn't tell you?
00:21:40.674,00:21:41.758,That's not it.
00:21:43.259,00:21:45.429,Why do you think we went to the City of Bones?
00:21:46.680,00:21:52.018,"She's trying to find a way to remember, but they said it's like someone erased her whole past."
00:21:57.649,00:21:58.984,Damn Magnus Bane.
00:22:10.829,00:22:11.830,Bloody Mary?
00:22:12.748,00:22:14.207,Original recipe.
00:22:31.433,00:22:32.518,What's the Clave like?
00:22:33.685,00:22:36.397,I learned how Shadowhunters really feel about us.
00:22:37.523,00:22:41.151,It's bad enough not to have a vote. It's worse to be treated as inferiors.
00:22:41.985,00:22:43.945,"They act as if Seelies aren't half-angel, too."
00:22:46.698,00:22:48.409,You think that makes us a lesser people?
00:22:50.494,00:22:52.621,Some of us like a little spice.
00:22:57.793,00:22:59.461,"No, not really."
00:23:02.673,00:23:05.842,"I love that you can't lie. Of course, you don't trust me."
00:23:06.552,00:23:09.345,-But should I trust you? -To do what?
00:23:09.430,00:23:13.725,"Oh, I don't know. Not fool around with anyone else?"
00:23:16.895,00:23:20.065,"Anyway, I know you've been seeing Camille."
00:23:20.148,00:23:21.692,How?
00:23:24.528,00:23:26.112,She is very attractive.
00:23:26.196,00:23:28.073,"No, no. I totally get it."
00:23:28.990,00:23:31.868,But how does that work? Talk about Shadow World enemies.
00:23:31.952,00:23:35.163,Seelies and vampires don't really speak to each other unless they have to.
00:23:36.081,00:23:37.290,How do you two manage it?
00:23:47.008,00:23:48.719,So do you go to her place?
00:23:49.219,00:23:51.638,"-Sometimes... -Mmm, that's so brave."
00:23:52.598,00:23:54.850,A Seelie can't exactly walk in the front door.
00:23:57.143,00:24:00.021,So how would you get in to the Hotel DuMort?
00:24:02.232,00:24:03.274,How would you?
00:24:04.985,00:24:06.402,I asked first.
00:24:19.374,00:24:20.416,Alec.
00:24:25.046,00:24:28.509,Don't tell me. I don't wanna have to report you.
00:24:29.259,00:24:39.060,"It's just that, you know, Clary is-- That girl is Valentine's-- The monster's daughter."
00:24:39.144,00:24:43.690,"There must be some reason why the roaches are coming out of the woodwork again, right?"
00:24:47.110,00:24:49.571,-I'll leave you to it. -Hodge?
00:24:51.031,00:24:52.115,Thank you.
00:24:53.491,00:24:54.785,"You remind me of me, Alec."
00:25:02.208,00:25:03.585,Hey...
00:25:05.921,00:25:07.756,Don't make the same mistakes I did.
00:25:09.507,00:25:10.717,Look where it got me.
00:25:20.310,00:25:21.603,"Do you wanna jump on the bike, baby?"
00:25:21.687,00:25:22.771,-Yeah. -All right.
00:25:25.231,00:25:26.482,"Ooh, yeah."
00:25:27.525,00:25:28.526,Hey.
00:25:29.653,00:25:32.864,"-You having fun with my girl? -Piss off, Shadowhunter."
00:25:36.618,00:25:37.703,That's not gonna happen.
00:25:38.369,00:25:40.080,You heard the lady. Step aside.
00:25:46.419,00:25:48.004,"Don't move, Clary."
00:26:02.936,00:26:04.020,As you were.
00:26:20.370,00:26:22.330,Why did you let him do that to me?
00:26:22.413,00:26:25.541,I couldn't exactly dig around in his pockets for the keys.
00:26:25.626,00:26:28.461,"What, you were gonna let him turn me into a vampire just to get his keys?"
00:26:28.544,00:26:29.755,Don't you trust me?
00:26:32.924,00:26:35.468,"Better hold tight, this bike runs on demon energy."
00:26:35.551,00:26:38.596,"-It's pretty mean. -Don't their bikes run on that, too?"
00:26:38.680,00:26:42.392,Why do you think I picked this one? It's been modified.
00:26:45.603,00:26:47.397,-But we still have to find-- -Simon.
00:26:47.480,00:26:49.565,"Yes, we'll find your mundie."
00:26:50.817,00:26:53.904,-You got a good grip? -You keep asking me that!
00:27:04.372,00:27:06.499,Why didn't you just do this in the first place?
00:27:50.836,00:27:52.879,It's an old meatpacker's service entrance.
00:27:52.963,00:27:55.841,"If we go back there, we come up into the basement of the Hotel DuMort."
00:27:56.883,00:27:57.968,"Perfect, right?"
00:27:58.051,00:28:01.012,"We distract the vamps, Clary and Jace have time to find Simon."
00:28:02.013,00:28:04.307,-Okay. -Okay?
00:28:05.141,00:28:07.685,It was hard work interrogating Meliorn to get this intel.
00:28:08.644,00:28:09.980,"Great job, Izzy."
00:28:10.646,00:28:12.357,You have faerie dust on your dress.
00:28:19.114,00:28:22.533,"You know, you'd be a lot happier if you weren't so freaking repressed."
00:28:23.994,00:28:25.120,Alec?
00:28:26.788,00:28:28.206,Hello?
00:28:47.851,00:28:48.852,We've been breached.
00:28:48.935,00:28:51.354,"I don't know how many there are, but it's the real thing."
00:28:51.437,00:28:53.940,I want them stopped now. I don't care how.
00:28:57.903,00:28:59.863,They're near the stairwell or in it. Go!
00:29:02.698,00:29:04.242,"It's all right, darling."
00:29:04.325,00:29:07.120,"Will you just stay right there, just for a minute?"
00:29:07.996,00:29:08.997,Are you all right?
00:29:14.335,00:29:16.129,Light-hearted and light-headed.
00:29:17.672,00:29:19.758,I guess I had a little too much to drink.
00:29:22.302,00:29:26.139,"That's a mind-blower because... you had too much to drink, and I'm..."
00:29:27.098,00:29:28.141,whatever I am.
00:29:28.850,00:29:30.268,You certainly are.
00:29:33.271,00:29:35.899,They're in the building. Stop them.
00:29:44.115,00:29:45.325,it's called encanto.
00:29:48.453,00:29:52.082,It's kind of like what a cobra does to a mouse right before it strikes.
00:29:52.874,00:29:57.503,This will keep you safe just in case you run into Mr. Fascinating again.
00:29:59.505,00:30:00.756,"I'm never gonna live that down, am I?"
00:30:00.841,00:30:02.467,Probably not. No.
00:30:03.844,00:30:06.847,-Ow! What is that? -This is for silence.
00:30:06.930,00:30:10.100,"The vamps won't hear us coming, but we can't disguise the scent of our blood from them."
00:30:13.228,00:30:17.899,"Once we enter the building through there, they'll know something's up."
00:30:18.441,00:30:20.819,"But if our plan works, we'll have time to find Simon."
00:30:23.238,00:30:25.907,The mundane world is all into vampires.
00:30:25.991,00:30:30.661,I don't get it. They see everyone else as an animated sack of meat.
00:30:33.789,00:30:35.625,That's 'cause now you know it's all real.
00:30:37.127,00:30:41.714,"Still, you gotta hand it to them, though. They know how to frame a narrative."
00:30:43.091,00:30:44.634,How will we find Simon?
00:30:45.676,00:30:47.846,He'll be in the most secure room in the building.
00:30:48.847,00:30:51.474,"Trust me, we'll know it when we see it."
00:30:51.557,00:30:55.145,What if they do an encanto on him? Will he turn into a vampire?
00:30:55.228,00:30:57.981,"No, you have to drink vampire blood for that."
00:30:59.357,00:31:01.526,"It's an overly involved process, if you ask me."
00:31:01.609,00:31:03.694,But I don't get it. What if a vampire bites him?
00:31:04.905,00:31:08.449,They won't drain him right away. They like to take their time.
00:31:08.533,00:31:10.743,Vampires are real gourmets.
00:31:10.826,00:31:12.203,He'll be terrified.
00:31:12.287,00:31:16.875,"Actually, he'll feel kind of high, kind of like he's in love."
00:31:16.958,00:31:18.376,-With the one who bit him? -Yeah.
00:31:18.459,00:31:19.835,That's awful.
00:31:20.545,00:31:21.546,It's awful?
00:31:24.215,00:31:25.383,Guess I wouldn't know.
00:31:26.009,00:31:27.218,You've never been bitten?
00:31:32.098,00:31:34.184,You've never been in love.
00:31:37.645,00:31:40.231,The point is it wears off. Just like love.
00:31:42.192,00:31:44.152,"What's the deal with you and that guy, anyway?"
00:31:44.235,00:31:45.695,-He seems kinda-- -Be careful.
00:31:45.778,00:31:47.363,Unworthy of you? How's that?
00:31:47.948,00:31:49.782,You really think you have it all figured out?
00:31:49.865,00:31:51.367,I do.
00:31:51.451,00:31:54.245,-You don't even understand friendship. -Really?
00:31:54.329,00:31:58.791,"-You have a parabatai, right? -Alec would die for me."
00:31:58.874,00:32:00.793,Now you understand me and Simon.
00:32:07.175,00:32:08.468,Remember how to use the blade?
00:32:09.260,00:32:12.388,Keep your arms steady and don't overestimate what you know.
00:32:12.472,00:32:14.224,They can be tricky.
00:32:14.307,00:32:16.767,We'll try and keep them off you as much as we can.
00:32:16.851,00:32:20.021,-Where are Alec and Isabelle? -Being distracting.
00:32:21.064,00:32:22.773,"You're really not gonna talk to me, are you?"
00:32:22.857,00:32:24.692,That's because you have no idea what you're talking about.
00:32:24.775,00:32:27.612,"But I do. You're hiding from yourself, not me."
00:32:27.695,00:32:30.490,"You have feelings, whether you like 'em or not, Alec."
00:32:30.573,00:32:34.410,"This is not the time or the place, Izzy."
00:32:34.494,00:32:36.912,I don't know. Looks pretty smooth so far.
00:32:56.057,00:32:57.725,"Well, not that smooth."
00:32:58.977,00:33:02.605,"-Any day now. -Yeah, if you hold the door still, it might be a lot easier."
00:33:03.856,00:33:05.025,It's not taking it.
00:33:12.282,00:33:15.285,"Whoever said, The pen is mightier than the sword, was an idiot."
00:33:15.368,00:33:17.078,"When you're right, you're right."
00:33:22.458,00:33:24.627,"Wait, I hear something."
00:33:24.710,00:33:26.046,Hold up.
00:33:35.221,00:33:36.931,Do you think they know where we are?
00:33:37.015,00:33:38.266,"That's the idea, right?"
00:33:39.809,00:33:41.102,How long do you think we have to distract them for?
00:33:41.186,00:33:42.312,Ten more minutes.
00:33:42.395,00:33:44.230,Ten minutes? Are you kidding?
00:33:44.314,00:33:45.606,We're liquid lunch in five.
00:33:45.690,00:33:48.609,-So let's distract them. -So let's distract them.
00:33:49.902,00:33:51.529,You better get ready.
00:34:15.970,00:34:17.763,"Keep coming, boys."
00:34:35.030,00:34:36.241,-Clary! -You!
00:34:38.868,00:34:42.205,Just ran 30 blocks to get here before I freaking burned to death in the sun!
00:34:43.581,00:34:45.416,"You missed your ride, angel doll."
00:34:46.876,00:34:50.713,"Why'd you go with him, huh? You really know how to hurt a guy."
00:35:00.014,00:35:01.141,I really do know how to hurt a guy.
00:35:01.224,00:35:02.933,"-Jace! -Clary, look out!"
00:35:05.395,00:35:07.355,"-Bitch, you're finished! -The blade!"
00:35:21.661,00:35:23.121,Okay.
00:35:44.184,00:35:45.601,I killed him.
00:35:46.436,00:35:47.437,He was already dead.
00:35:48.938,00:35:51.732,"Plus, he wanted to kill you. Remember that."
00:35:51.816,00:35:53.401,"She did great, right?"
00:35:55.153,00:35:58.323,"Yeah, you did. You should be proud."
00:36:00.408,00:36:02.660,"Thanks, but... it's not about me."
00:36:03.661,00:36:04.745,Let's go find Simon.
00:36:11.836,00:36:14.172,Why is it so loud out there? What is that?
00:36:14.255,00:36:15.590,"It's nothing, dearest. A party."
00:36:15.673,00:36:18.343,You know the neighbors in these places. Short-term rentals.
00:36:18.426,00:36:20.928,I know. Bloody Marys for everyone.
00:36:23.889,00:36:26.100,Where is everyone?
00:36:26.184,00:36:27.435,Clary! I'm here!
00:36:28.394,00:36:31.272,"I told you, you're a hostage! Accept it!"
00:36:34.442,00:36:37.570,Don't move. I know you wanna find out how this story ends.
00:36:38.696,00:36:42.617,"Thank you, Raphael. I'll take care of this from here."
00:36:42.700,00:36:43.743,You don't have to bother.
00:36:43.826,00:36:46.829,"No, honestly. I've had it with this thing."
00:36:46.912,00:36:49.039,Give it to me. I'll finish it off.
00:36:50.333,00:36:52.377,They're almost here and you can't be caught.
00:36:52.460,00:36:55.796,"You're too valuable. Don't worry, I'll kill it."
00:36:55.880,00:36:57.798,"-That's a little excessive, yeah? -Shut up."
00:36:58.549,00:37:00.301,Take the back passage out through the tunnels.
00:37:00.385,00:37:01.511,Go!
00:37:03.053,00:37:08.893,Now you listen and do exactly as I say... nothing more.
00:37:21.531,00:37:23.073,They're coming.
00:37:27.245,00:37:30.623,"-That's not gonna do any good. -Listen to him, Clary Fairchild."
00:37:30.706,00:37:32.250,Put it away.
00:37:32.333,00:37:34.585,I've had more than enough of your friend for one day.
00:37:35.295,00:37:38.298,I'd love to cut his throat. Don't give me a reason.
00:37:39.173,00:37:40.258,Put it away!
00:37:43.261,00:37:45.430,"Simon. Simon, are you all right?"
00:37:45.513,00:37:47.307,-I wouldn't say all right-- -Stop talking!
00:37:49.058,00:37:52.353,Now... if you would all just follow me.
00:37:53.688,00:37:55.022,Let's go!
00:37:59.068,00:38:01.612,"Come on, let's go! Up here now!"
00:38:04.824,00:38:07.868,"That's right, get down there now! Get down there or I'll kill him right now!"
00:38:07.952,00:38:10.037,"Look, we're not gonna hurt you. We just want Simon."
00:38:10.120,00:38:12.164,I'm glad you do. We don't!
00:38:12.247,00:38:13.874,"-We wanted you. -Well, here I am."
00:38:16.627,00:38:18.296,"-Now, get out! Go! -Not without Simon."
00:38:18.379,00:38:21.173,Shut up! Open that door right now or I'll kill him right here.
00:38:21.256,00:38:34.354,-Listen to him! -But Simon will die if-- -I don't know how to thank you. -Don't thank me. You mean nothing.
00:38:34.437,00:38:36.564,This is about Valentine and the chaos he can bring.
00:38:36.647,00:38:38.441,-Come on! -Jace Wayland!
00:38:54.957,00:38:56.208,Shouldn't we get the hell out of here?
00:38:56.291,00:38:59.003,"-Why, Simon? -They're right downstairs."
00:38:59.086,00:39:00.295,Let them come after us.
00:39:01.005,00:39:03.007,They'll just turn into a bunch of fried eggs out here.
00:39:03.090,00:39:04.299,I thought you said you watch movies.
00:39:08.429,00:39:09.514,"Oh, my God."
00:39:09.597,00:39:12.517,"Oh, my God, it's over. It's actually over."
00:39:13.225,00:39:17.187,"I was so afraid I would lose you. But it's true, you're actually here."
00:39:17.271,00:39:19.148,You know I'd do anything for you.
00:39:31.494,00:39:34.664,"-Say that again. -I couldn't live without you, Simon."
00:39:35.956,00:39:39.419,You're all I have left. My whole life just disappeared.
00:39:39.502,00:39:42.922,"I'm supposed to... be this other thing, live this other way."
00:39:44.131,00:39:45.257,You're my best friend.
00:39:49.595,00:39:52.973,"Don't you ever, ever let yourself get in that kind of trouble again."
00:39:54.600,00:39:55.851,Got it? Yeah?
00:40:02.942,00:40:05.945,Well... no accounting for taste.
00:40:06.028,00:40:07.488,"Yeah, you should talk."
00:40:10.658,00:40:12.577,"Look, can I just say one thing?"
00:40:12.660,00:40:14.244,"You will, whatever I say, so shoot."
00:40:14.328,00:40:17.832,"You think you know Clary, right? But you may not."
00:40:17.915,00:40:19.417,"-Think about who her father is. -You know what, Alec?"
00:40:19.500,00:40:21.627,"Do not start this again with me, Alec."
00:40:21.711,00:40:24.547,"-She just came out of nowhere, Jace. -She has no one."
00:40:24.630,00:40:26.340,"-Just listen to me for one second-- -Alec, stop!"
00:40:34.348,00:40:35.850,Just stop.
00:40:36.809,00:40:38.185,"I'm older than you, Jace."
00:40:39.228,00:40:40.563,I'm not in your shadow.
00:40:41.731,00:40:43.649,If you really feel that way about her...
00:40:44.650,00:40:46.110,why did you help us tonight?
00:00:10.010,00:00:11.303,My best friend is suffering.
00:00:11.386,00:00:12.470,You're bleeding.
00:00:15.598,00:00:17.767,"They kidnapped a mundie, that's a big no-no."
00:00:19.519,00:00:21.771,Isn't this the wrong time to be antagonizing the Clave?
00:00:21.854,00:00:24.482,"She who controls the Mortal Cup, controls the Shadow World."
00:00:24.566,00:00:27.194,Shouldn't you be teaching me to fight vampires or something?
00:00:27.277,00:00:29.612,-So how would you get in? -How would you?
00:00:30.863,00:00:33.450,They're in the building. Stop them.
00:00:35.868,00:00:36.869,I killed him.
00:00:36.953,00:00:38.330,He was already dead.
00:00:38.413,00:00:40.998,If you would all just follow me.
00:00:44.711,00:00:46.379,Jace Wayland!
00:00:46.463,00:00:48.173,Remember who your friends are.
00:01:11.071,00:01:13.490,"It's okay, I'm here. You're safe."
00:01:15.867,00:01:17.327,What?
00:01:19.954,00:01:23.208,You still seem... kind of freaked.
00:01:27.044,00:01:28.505,Hey.
00:01:28.588,00:01:30.673,I got you. You're okay.
00:01:35.512,00:01:39.141,I was strapped to this piece of furniture and my mom was there.
00:01:40.099,00:01:44.771,"She kept telling this guy to protect me, but then he reached his hand into my skull and ripped out my brain."
00:01:46.731,00:01:48.566,Tell me about it.
00:01:50.568,00:01:54.531,"-Shouldn't you be in the infirmary? -Uh, I just..."
00:01:54.614,00:01:55.907,really needed to see you.
00:01:56.824,00:01:59.994,I am so sorry. My messed up life put you in danger.
00:02:00.077,00:02:02.955,"-I'm fine. -No, if those vampires hurt you..."
00:02:03.039,00:02:05.333,I couldn't live with myself.
00:02:05.417,00:02:07.919,You're all I've got left.
00:02:08.002,00:02:13.090,"Don't get me wrong, I'm totally grateful that your friends got me out before the vampires drained me like a Big Gulp."
00:02:14.384,00:02:15.552,But...
00:02:17.220,00:02:20.432,How well do you know this Jace guy? Can you trust him?
00:02:20.515,00:02:21.933,I think so.
00:02:22.892,00:02:25.853,"I mean, he saved my life... and yours."
00:02:25.937,00:02:27.605,True.
00:02:27.689,00:02:29.566,But I was thinking...
00:02:30.942,00:02:35.029,all of this craziness started the minute you bumped into him at Pandemonium.
00:02:35.112,00:02:36.739,You think that's just a coincidence?
00:02:36.823,00:02:39.075,"Honestly, I don't even know what to think anymore."
00:02:39.159,00:02:42.245,All I know is I have to get my memories back.
00:02:46.583,00:02:48.918,"Maybe I saw where my mom hid the Cup, and..."
00:02:49.001,00:02:51.213,and if I could just remember...
00:02:51.296,00:02:52.380,I could save her.
00:02:52.464,00:02:54.549,I just... I wanna put all of this behind me.
00:02:58.177,00:03:00.680,I don't even know where to start looking. I'm...
00:03:01.806,00:03:02.974,I'm just lost.
00:03:03.057,00:03:04.851,Hey... Okay.
00:03:04.934,00:03:08.605,"Look, start with what we know, okay?"
00:03:08.688,00:03:10.232,We know that dreams are remnants of memories.
00:03:10.315,00:03:14.361,"-Right. Yeah. -You saw your mom in the nightmare, before the guy was reaching into your brain."
00:03:14.444,00:03:17.154,"Yeah, she... She called him Magnus."
00:03:17.239,00:03:19.031,"-I mean, it's completely random, I never-- -Magnus Bane?"
00:03:20.242,00:03:21.993,Maybe.
00:03:22.076,00:03:24.537,-Why? How do you know that name? -I heard it from the vampire.
00:03:29.334,00:03:33.505,She was super pissed at this Magnus Bane guy when I told her that someone took your memories.
00:03:36.048,00:03:38.050,You've just... You've given me my first solid lead.
00:03:38.134,00:03:39.135,-I did? -Yeah.
00:03:39.219,00:03:41.679,"Awesome. Wait, where are you going?"
00:03:41.763,00:03:44.056,I have to find Jace and tell him about Magnus Bane.
00:03:44.140,00:03:45.433,Oh.
00:03:46.601,00:03:48.353,What would I do without you?
00:03:54.150,00:03:57.445,Really? Again?
00:03:57.529,00:03:59.071,I'm such an idiot.
00:04:06.496,00:04:08.080,"Oh, God."
00:04:22.762,00:04:23.888,I gotta get out of here.
00:04:24.889,00:04:25.890,Gotta get out of here...
00:04:35.900,00:04:38.653,"Jace, I need to talk to you about something, it's really..."
00:04:39.487,00:04:41.030,Oh...
00:04:43.741,00:04:45.493,Let me just grab a shirt.
00:04:45.577,00:04:46.828,Yeah.
00:04:50.790,00:04:51.958,"So, what's up?"
00:04:52.041,00:04:54.377,"-You wanted to see me? -Yeah, um..."
00:04:54.461,00:04:57.254,I need you to tell me everything you know about Magnus Bane.
00:04:57.339,00:05:00.091,"Magnus Bane is the High Warlock of Brooklyn, why?"
00:05:00.174,00:05:03.052,"Because that vampire, Camille, practically accused him of stealing my memories."
00:05:03.636,00:05:04.804,Where did you hear that?
00:05:04.887,00:05:08.725,"When Simon told Camille someone took my memories back at the Hotel DuMort, she blamed Magnus Bane."
00:05:08.808,00:05:11.519,"Right, and you believe your little mundane friend?"
00:05:11.978,00:05:13.104,I believe Simon.
00:05:14.188,00:05:19.527,"Besides, I keep having these dreams where this Magnus guy is with my mom and she tells him to protect me."
00:05:19.611,00:05:21.237,"You mean, like, memory fragments?"
00:05:23.698,00:05:25.658,"Whatever, why didn't you tell me about that?"
00:05:25.742,00:05:29.704,"Because, Jace, practically a week ago I didn't even know this world existed."
00:05:29.787,00:05:31.456,Let alone that Magnus is real.
00:05:31.539,00:05:35.460,"Magnus' magic is so powerful, he can evade even the Silent Brothers."
00:05:35.543,00:05:37.837,If he's the warlock that took your memories...
00:05:37.920,00:05:39.381,he could be the key to everything.
00:05:39.464,00:05:42.592,People are risking their lives to help me get my memories back.
00:05:44.511,00:05:46.345,But there might not be anything there.
00:05:46.429,00:05:50.057,I might not remember anything that will lead to the Mortal Cup... or my mom.
00:05:51.893,00:05:57.607,Believe me when I tell you that finding your memories is our only shot at getting the Mortal Cup back.
00:05:59.776,00:06:01.986,I'm willing to take that chance on you.
00:06:02.069,00:06:04.906,"Jace, I need you. The mundie's leaving."
00:06:04.989,00:06:07.324,-Simon? He can't leave. -He can and he is.
00:06:07.409,00:06:09.160,Unless you wanna tie him down and restrain him?
00:06:11.871,00:06:14.040,"Izzy, go wake Alec and Hodge."
00:06:14.123,00:06:16.584,We might have a lead on the Mortal Cup.
00:06:23.508,00:06:25.968,"I already told Isabelle, they can't keep me prisoner here."
00:06:26.052,00:06:28.179,"Prisoner? Wait, what... Simon!"
00:06:28.262,00:06:31.140,"-Where are you going? -I'm going home, Clary."
00:06:31.223,00:06:34.811,"And if you haven't already completely drunk their Kool-Aid, -then you're coming with me. -You know I can't."
00:06:39.607,00:06:42.234,"In fact, this is the safest place she could possibly be."
00:06:42.318,00:06:44.696,"You don't get to talk to me, Captain America."
00:06:44.779,00:06:47.198,"Considering I'm the guy with the weapons, I get to say what I want."
00:06:47.281,00:06:48.950,"-Okay, come at me, bro! -Oh, yeah?"
00:06:49.033,00:06:50.452,"-Yeah! -Hey, what is your problem?"
00:06:50.535,00:06:51.661,He's my problem!
00:06:53.580,00:06:56.708,Do you remember him? Total jerk with the square jaw.
00:06:56.791,00:06:59.251,"Smelled like body spray, always bullying people."
00:06:59.335,00:07:01.963,"Why don't you do your own homework? Just once, yeah?"
00:07:05.842,00:07:07.051,I can take care of myself.
00:07:10.430,00:07:12.890,"-I'm not saving his ass a second time-- -Really, Jace?"
00:07:12.974,00:07:14.141,Simon! Hey...
00:07:14.225,00:07:16.478,-Simon... Hey! Simon. -What?
00:07:16.561,00:07:18.187,"You were kidnapped by vampires, okay?"
00:07:18.270,00:07:20.231,You of all people should know how dangerous it is out there.
00:07:20.314,00:07:21.899,I'll be fine.
00:07:21.983,00:07:24.527,"Hey, you're not the only one who's in danger."
00:07:24.611,00:07:29.073,"All right? If you go home right now, you're putting your mother, and your sister, and even Maureen at risk."
00:07:29.156,00:07:30.908,-Think about them. -I am thinking about them.
00:07:30.992,00:07:32.494,-Are you? -Yeah.
00:07:36.998,00:07:39.626,-Simon... -Come with me.
00:07:39.709,00:07:42.336,We can crash at my place. We can figure all this out.
00:07:42.419,00:07:46.298,You have no idea how much I want to go back to the way things were.
00:07:46.382,00:07:48.551,-To be with you and my mom and-- -Clary.
00:07:48.635,00:07:50.970,We've had each other's backs our whole lives.
00:07:52.138,00:07:53.430,We've never needed anyone.
00:07:55.808,00:07:57.977,Let me help you. We don't...
00:07:59.687,00:08:01.981,-We don't need these people. -Simon...
00:08:02.732,00:08:04.441,"I don't know how to explain this, okay?"
00:08:04.526,00:08:07.529,But I think... I think these are my people.
00:08:11.032,00:08:12.617,"Message received, loud and clear."
00:08:16.996,00:08:18.122,Simon!
00:08:24.378,00:08:25.880,He's over 300 years old.
00:08:25.963,00:08:30.134,"And, as you can see, he's not exactly shied away from the pleasures of every century."
00:08:30.217,00:08:32.845,His tastes are both exquisite...
00:08:32.929,00:08:34.639,and quite excessive.
00:08:34.722,00:08:36.599,He looks like the Downworld's David Guetta.
00:08:38.768,00:08:40.061,Vampire?
00:08:42.814,00:08:44.065,This is not a joke.
00:08:45.942,00:08:47.694,Alec's right.
00:08:47.777,00:08:50.863,"Now, Magnus is one of the most powerful warlocks I've ever known."
00:08:50.947,00:08:53.365,He has a deep mistrust of Shadowhunters.
00:08:53.449,00:08:55.326,"Well, then why did he help my mom remove my memories?"
00:08:55.409,00:08:58.287,"-Isn't she a Shadowhunter? -Yes, one of the best."
00:08:58.370,00:09:00.456,But help might not be the most accurate word.
00:09:01.248,00:09:03.292,"Now, did Magnus provide a service for Jocelyn?"
00:09:03.375,00:09:04.752,Perhaps.
00:09:04.836,00:09:08.505,"But more than likely, your mother paid Magnus handsomely for his magic."
00:09:08.590,00:09:11.634,Warlocks usually require payment before they help anyone with anything.
00:09:11.718,00:09:15.847,Word from the Clave is that most of the warlocks have gone into hiding since Valentine began hunting them.
00:09:15.930,00:09:23.605,"Valentine must be searching for the warlock, where did Jocelyn-- Hodge, your rune. You okay?"
00:09:27.358,00:09:29.443,Magnus finds us.
00:09:29.526,00:09:32.363,"We'll set up a meeting, somewhere protected."
00:09:32.446,00:09:33.990,Lure him out of hiding.
00:09:34.073,00:09:36.075,And I know exactly where we do it.
00:09:44.125,00:09:46.043,"-Nice, Izzy. -And where'd you get that?"
00:09:46.127,00:09:48.295,During my surveillance of the Downworlders.
00:09:48.379,00:09:50.172,"From what I hear, Magnus likes to party."
00:09:50.256,00:09:52.925,He'll never go for it. Not with Valentine trying to kill him.
00:09:53.009,00:09:54.886,Of course he will.
00:09:54.969,00:09:58.389,He'll blend in. Hide in plain sight.
00:10:00.141,00:10:03.728,"If Magnus is coming out of hiding, he's going to one of the biggest parties of the year."
00:10:03.811,00:10:06.272,Never underestimate Magnus' hedonism.
00:10:07.523,00:10:08.650,Or his greed.
00:10:09.901,00:10:11.235,Come with me.
00:10:23.873,00:10:24.999,Is that real?
00:10:27.418,00:10:33.424,"And this necklace has special meaning to Magnus Bane as it was a gift from him to his then lover, Camille Belcourt."
00:10:33.507,00:10:37.261,"-What, Camille and Magnus were lovers? -Warlock gets around."
00:10:38.220,00:10:41.598,Magnus bought it in 1857 for the price of his London townhouse.
00:10:41.683,00:10:46.646,"Now, the jewel is enchanted by a spell that alerts the wearer to the presence of demons."
00:10:49.982,00:10:52.985,Magnus has longed to reunite with this necklace.
00:10:54.153,00:10:55.237,Offer it to him.
00:10:55.863,00:10:57.489,He might just take the bait.
00:10:57.573,00:11:00.076,I'll send Magnus a fire message to arrange the meeting.
00:11:01.368,00:11:03.705,We have to get to Magnus before Valentine does.
00:11:12.171,00:11:24.976,"How is it that my most effective asset Wait a minute, what's that, hmm?"
00:11:32.191,00:11:33.901,Scouts from the Clave.
00:11:58.092,00:12:01.512,The expulsion of the poison was so powerful that it killed Pangborn.
00:12:05.933,00:12:07.268,Fearless.
00:12:08.394,00:12:09.812,Dedicated.
00:12:13.565,00:12:14.566,How so?
00:12:14.650,00:12:22.784,"When that filthy warlock tainted Pangborn's pure Shadowhunter blood, she turned him into an abomination."
00:12:24.869,00:12:27.204,At least he gave his life for the cause.
00:12:32.835,00:12:34.586,Their blood could be interesting.
00:12:41.010,00:12:44.138,You're 30 minutes late and you're not responding to calls.
00:12:44.221,00:12:48.935,"-Vargas is looking for you. -Relax, I had something to take care of."
00:12:49.018,00:12:51.062,-Jerky? -It's not even 9:00.
00:12:51.938,00:12:53.772,It's never too early for teriyaki.
00:12:58.861,00:13:02.198,"Ever since your witnesses wound up dead, command has you under a microscope."
00:13:04.575,00:13:06.577,"No, you're not. Get your act together, Luke."
00:13:06.660,00:13:08.745,Show the mundanes you're doing your job.
00:13:08.830,00:13:10.164,Our people need you to keep your shield.
00:13:11.248,00:13:14.961,"If you want me to get the Cup so badly, I need to get Clary alone."
00:13:21.800,00:13:23.594,What are you wearing to the Downworlder party tonight?
00:13:23.677,00:13:26.097,I don't know. I was just thinking about wearing this.
00:13:27.223,00:13:28.307,I don't think so.
00:13:28.390,00:13:30.809,No Downworlder would be caught dead in that.
00:13:30.893,00:13:33.020,"Plus, it's a party, not a poetry slam."
00:13:34.480,00:13:36.815,"Well, I don't really have any party clothes with me, so..."
00:13:36.899,00:13:38.985,"So you'll have to wear mine, hmm?"
00:13:39.986,00:13:42.738,"You realize, one of these days you're gonna have to tell me where and when."
00:13:42.821,00:13:44.281,Where and when what?
00:13:44.781,00:13:48.911,Where you get your spending money and... when are you letting me go to a store?
00:13:48.995,00:13:50.287,Clary...
00:13:51.205,00:13:53.832,"-Okay, that dress is way too tight. -It's stretchy."
00:13:55.501,00:13:57.669,"-Put it on. -Ugh, fine."
00:14:00.131,00:14:01.883,Try these.
00:14:05.136,00:14:08.722,"I don't know, Isabelle, I think I'm more of a jeans and T-shirt kinda girl."
00:14:19.901,00:14:21.861,-Really? -Really.
00:14:24.196,00:14:25.572,Someone's looking badass.
00:14:26.323,00:14:27.324,"Oh, thanks."
00:14:31.620,00:14:32.914,She cleans up well.
00:14:32.997,00:14:34.665,I'm gonna go see Alec.
00:14:34.748,00:14:37.084,He never knows what to wear to these parties either.
00:14:45.551,00:14:47.136,"Yeah, well, um..."
00:14:47.219,00:14:51.098,"I guess it's pointless for me to ask you to stay behind, while I go meet Magnus by myself."
00:14:51.974,00:14:53.142,Things could get sticky.
00:14:54.268,00:14:55.686,Magnus is being hunted.
00:14:56.728,00:14:58.064,You're gonna need a weapon.
00:15:02.734,00:15:04.278,That's a seraph dagger.
00:15:04.861,00:15:06.197,The blade knows you.
00:15:23.089,00:15:27.718,"-When did you become so talkative? -Magnus, I beg you to reconsider."
00:15:28.177,00:15:30.096,"Always frowning, Elias."
00:15:38.854,00:15:40.439,You cannot attend this meeting.
00:15:40.522,00:15:42.483,No matter what the Shadowhunter is offering.
00:15:42.566,00:15:44.026,Valentine is getting close.
00:15:44.110,00:15:46.528,It is far too dangerous for you to leave the lair.
00:15:46.612,00:15:52.159,I was alive when the Dead Sea was just a lake that was feeling a little poorly.
00:15:53.577,00:15:55.621,While I value your counsel...
00:15:56.455,00:15:59.625,so much red brick makes me feel like a caged animal.
00:16:00.334,00:16:02.628,Is one necklace really worth the risk?
00:16:04.255,00:16:05.672,This necklace is.
00:16:07.299,00:16:09.093,This discussion is over.
00:16:09.176,00:16:12.221,I will meet with Clary Fairchild and the Wayland boy.
00:16:16.017,00:16:18.810,Go to the Spiral Labyrinth and tell Tessa that we need more shields.
00:16:18.894,00:16:22.398,"While I'm gone, have every warlock maintain the protective wards."
00:16:28.237,00:16:30.239,...but my guests are not.
00:16:31.407,00:16:32.824,Drink up.
00:16:43.669,00:16:45.671,Pick a weapon. I suggest your whip.
00:16:47.423,00:16:49.383,-What's wrong with you? -Nothing.
00:16:55.347,00:16:56.890,"It's a mission, not a party."
00:16:56.973,00:16:58.559,"Yeah, whatever."
00:16:58.642,00:17:00.852,"Before Clary got here, every day was the same."
00:17:00.936,00:17:04.356,"Go on a mission, kill demons. Go on a mission, kill demons."
00:17:04.440,00:17:07.234,-At least now things are interesting. -Interesting?
00:17:08.402,00:17:10.987,Valentine is alive and actively seeking the Cup.
00:17:11.072,00:17:12.948,He threatens our entire world.
00:17:13.032,00:17:14.783,And we're helping his daughter.
00:17:14.866,00:17:17.119,"Who, by the way, we have no reason to trust."
00:17:17.203,00:17:18.620,And who showed up out of nowhere.
00:17:18.704,00:17:22.624,"On top of that, we're gonna end up overpaying some warlock who may or may not have information we need."
00:17:22.708,00:17:24.793,"So, no, Izzy... I don't find it interesting."
00:17:24.876,00:17:26.087,Whoa!
00:17:29.548,00:17:31.633,"-Feel better now? -No, I don't."
00:17:34.053,00:17:35.679,"Okay, maybe a little."
00:17:37.098,00:17:39.225,"You can't keep bottling things up, Alec."
00:17:39.308,00:17:41.393,It's only a matter of time before they explode.
00:17:42.394,00:17:44.146,And not the fun kind of explode.
00:17:44.230,00:17:45.481,"All right, let's go."
00:17:45.564,00:17:47.524,And we're not going for the music.
00:18:02.789,00:18:04.375,"-Where were you? -Yeah, I'm fine."
00:18:06.293,00:18:10.589,"-What's wrong? -We were supposed to have rehearsal last night and you never showed, and I was calling and texting, you didn't answer."
00:18:10.672,00:18:13.008,"And then your mom said you were going out, so I didn't know what I..."
00:18:13.092,00:18:14.760,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
00:18:14.843,00:18:17.138,"I'm sorry, Maureen. I just, uh..."
00:18:17.221,00:18:18.680,I got caught up with school stuff.
00:18:26.230,00:18:28.565,-I had this all rehearsed-- -Simon?
00:18:28.649,00:18:30.276,"Oh, good, you're home. Hi, Maureen."
00:18:30.359,00:18:31.693,"-Hey, Ma. -Look, honey..."
00:18:32.528,00:18:36.448,"I don't want to be one of those mothers, you know, and I know that you're a man now and everything..."
00:18:36.532,00:18:41.453,"-Oh, God, this is not happening. -But if you stay out all night long, I expect at least a phone call."
00:18:41.537,00:18:44.206,"-Ma, I'm 18! -So you're supposed to know better."
00:18:51.880,00:18:54.300,-Okay... Okay! -All right? So use it.
00:18:57.844,00:18:59.680,"All right. Well, let's get a hustle on."
00:18:59.763,00:19:02.308,"The crockpot's been going all day, so dinner's almost ready."
00:19:03.016,00:19:04.601,You are welcome to join.
00:19:04.685,00:19:05.894,-Thank you. -If you like.
00:19:07.604,00:19:08.939,Right.
00:19:12.734,00:19:15.487,"-So, wait, you were with Clary all night? -Maureen, I'm sorry."
00:19:15.571,00:19:17.113,Because you just said that you were swamped with work.
00:19:17.198,00:19:18.907,"And if you guys are dating, then just say so."
00:19:20.992,00:19:22.661,We're not... we're not dating.
00:19:24.205,00:19:26.332,"Oh, you're not?"
00:19:26.415,00:19:27.958,No.
00:19:29.543,00:19:31.503,"Well, good, then..."
00:19:33.339,00:19:34.881,because I'd like to.
00:19:37.008,00:19:39.553,-You'd like to what? -I'd like to date you.
00:19:41.513,00:19:44.183,"Oh, my God, I don't know why this is so hard for me to talk to you."
00:19:48.103,00:19:49.521,-It's okay. -I'm really... Let me just...
00:19:49.605,00:19:52.274,Ow! Damn it!
00:19:52.358,00:19:53.567,Damn!
00:19:58.322,00:19:59.531,I'm bleeding.
00:19:59.615,00:20:01.074,Do you have a...
00:20:01.575,00:20:03.034,Simon?
00:20:03.785,00:20:04.786,Simon?
00:20:06.121,00:20:07.789,"Simon, are you even listening to me?"
00:20:42.032,00:20:44.576,"Last time we were here, this place was crawling with vampires."
00:20:44.660,00:20:46.953,"Relax, all Downworlders hang out here."
00:20:47.037,00:20:49.998,-We just came on vampire night. -Right.
00:20:50.081,00:20:52.626,And when is all this gonna sound normal to me?
00:20:54.586,00:20:55.629,All clear.
00:20:56.463,00:20:57.839,Do you think red's my color?
00:20:57.923,00:21:00.384,"Iz, with a body like yours, everything's your color."
00:21:00.467,00:21:02.177,Good point.
00:21:02.261,00:21:06.432,"-Damn, I make this necklace look so good. -Will you take it off?"
00:21:06.515,00:21:10.477,I'm certain Magnus Bane doesn't want drool on his ruby when we make the exchange.
00:21:10.561,00:21:11.937,"You know, I wouldn't be so sure."
00:21:12.020,00:21:13.980,Most men like it when I admire their jewels.
00:21:16.066,00:21:18.360,You're such a buzzkill.
00:21:27.786,00:21:30.539,Blend in. Keep your weapons ready.
00:21:36.712,00:21:37.796,Magnus.
00:21:42.593,00:21:44.260,Clary Fairchild.
00:21:44.345,00:21:46.430,You've grown into a beautiful young woman.
00:21:46.513,00:21:48.264,Magnus Bane.
00:21:48.349,00:21:49.933,So you're the one who stole my memories.
00:21:50.016,00:21:53.061,At your mother's request. She knew the risk.
00:21:55.731,00:21:58.442,"Show me the jewelry, Shadowhunter."
00:22:01.820,00:22:03.530,Ooh...
00:22:03.614,00:22:06.658,"Give Clary back her memories, and you get the jewelry."
00:22:07.951,00:22:10.286,I have to confirm its authenticity.
00:22:19.004,00:22:21.089,Amor verus numquam moritur.
00:22:21.172,00:22:23.467,True love cannot die.
00:22:26.595,00:22:27.971,"Now, it's your turn to pay up."
00:22:29.806,00:22:32.934,"I wish I could retrieve your memories, but I no longer have them."
00:22:33.018,00:22:35.562,What? Where are they?
00:22:36.605,00:22:38.607,I fed them to a memory demon for safekeeping.
00:22:38.690,00:22:43.028,-And why the hell would you do that? -To protect Clary and the Cup.
00:22:43.111,00:22:46.782,"If Valentine ever captured me, he could torture Clary's memories out of me."
00:22:46.865,00:22:49.159,-Just like he tortured Dot. -Tortured?
00:22:49.242,00:22:50.452,"Wait, is Dot okay?"
00:22:51.412,00:22:52.454,You don't know?
00:22:55.290,00:22:56.332,Dot is dead.
00:22:58.293,00:22:59.545,What?
00:23:01.713,00:23:02.798,How do you know?
00:23:03.715,00:23:05.050,I can't feel her magic anymore.
00:23:07.719,00:23:10.346,Valentine killed her because she would not betray your mother.
00:23:11.264,00:23:12.641,"Oh, my God."
00:23:16.269,00:23:18.730,My lair can offer you protection no Shadowhunter ever could.
00:23:20.816,00:23:21.942,No!
00:23:22.025,00:23:23.569,"No, I'm not going anywhere with you."
00:23:23.652,00:23:26.697,Don't be a fool. Your mother would want you to live.
00:23:26.780,00:23:29.324,Then help me get my memories back from whatever demon you gave them to.
00:23:29.407,00:23:31.618,"Valentine is hunting you, too."
00:23:31.702,00:23:36.247,"And every moment we're outside my lair's protection, is a moment Valentine gets closer to finding us."
00:23:42.337,00:23:43.379,Come with me.
00:23:46.842,00:23:49.595,I won't offer again.
00:23:53.306,00:23:55.767,"No, I won't hide from my problems and neither should you."
00:24:10.657,00:24:12.493,Who are you?
00:24:15.286,00:24:16.622,"Magnus, wait!"
00:24:18.081,00:24:20.501,-You're my only hope. -Valentine found us.
00:24:20.584,00:24:22.586,I warned your mother this might happen.
00:24:22.669,00:24:23.837,Wait...
00:24:29.009,00:24:31.678,The area's secure. Looks like he was the only assassin.
00:24:31.762,00:24:33.555,He has a Circle rune on the base of his neck.
00:24:33.639,00:24:36.975,"They found us. It's not safe here. Clary, we have to go."
00:24:39.853,00:24:41.187,Clary...
00:24:51.740,00:24:52.741,Jace.
00:24:54.325,00:24:56.703,"-Clary, we have to move. -I'm catching my breath."
00:24:56.787,00:24:58.204,You know what? This is great.
00:24:58.288,00:25:02.584,"And not only did Magnus not get the girl her memories back, he took the necklace."
00:25:05.546,00:25:08.256,her name is Clary and I highly suggest you keep your voice down.
00:25:08.339,00:25:09.841,Why?
00:25:09.925,00:25:11.593,"What, are you afraid I'm gonna upset her?"
00:25:12.343,00:25:16.682,"We have risked our lives again and again for this girl, and where has it gotten us?"
00:25:16.765,00:25:19.685,All right? Nowhere. We're no closer to getting the Mortal Cup.
00:25:23.396,00:25:25.440,I don't care about your damn jewelry.
00:25:26.650,00:25:30.403,"I'm sorry you're gonna look bad in front of your bosses, okay?"
00:25:30.486,00:25:34.825,But my mother is still missing and my last chance at finding her just disappeared into thin air.
00:25:34.908,00:25:37.327,"-Clary, it's gonna be fine. -No, it's not!"
00:25:41.372,00:25:42.624,And Magnus?
00:25:42.708,00:25:45.961,Magnus will never come out of hiding again while Valentine is still after him.
00:25:47.588,00:25:50.048,And I will... I will never get my memories back.
00:25:51.174,00:25:52.550,You give up way too easy.
00:25:58.765,00:25:59.891,What is he doing?
00:25:59.975,00:26:01.392,He's tracking Magnus.
00:26:01.476,00:26:03.436,Be quiet and keep your distance.
00:26:03.519,00:26:05.438,The button belonged to Magnus.
00:26:05.521,00:26:07.858,Jace can pinpoint the location using that.
00:26:14.280,00:26:15.699,No.
00:26:15.782,00:26:18.243,The signal's not strong enough.
00:26:18.326,00:26:20.829,"Magnus must be blocking the track. Let's do this, Alec."
00:26:21.830,00:26:24.290,-Do what? -Parabatai tracking.
00:26:29.337,00:26:31.882,"When parabatais track, their power grows stronger."
00:26:32.674,00:26:35.510,Jace and Alec are gonna track Magnus together.
00:26:40.515,00:26:43.977,"Yeah, this whole parabatai thing seems oddly intimate, if you ask me."
00:26:54.821,00:26:55.989,Got him.
00:27:10.586,00:27:12.630,Magnus' lair is right behind that fence.
00:27:12.714,00:27:14.132,Magnus lives in a warehouse?
00:27:14.215,00:27:15.341,Not exactly.
00:27:16.426,00:27:17.761,Warlock glamour.
00:27:18.929,00:27:21.890,Something's wrong. It's far too easy to get this close.
00:27:21.973,00:27:23.892,His protective wards must be down.
00:27:26.019,00:27:27.437,Don't get in the way.
00:27:31.482,00:27:33.276,"Oh, God! Valentine found Magnus!"
00:27:38.489,00:27:39.950,Daddy!
00:27:41.284,00:27:42.953,Daddy?
00:27:43.036,00:27:44.162,"Daddy, get up, please!"
00:27:53.213,00:27:54.589,Clary Fairchild.
00:27:55.966,00:27:58.885,Valentine will be so pleased to meet you.
00:28:08.519,00:28:09.730,Any time.
00:28:10.897,00:28:13.316,Stick close. It's safest if we stay together.
00:28:13.399,00:28:14.692,It's okay.
00:28:14.776,00:28:16.569,"I won't leave you alone, I promise."
00:28:24.160,00:28:25.829,"Your magic's strong, warlock."
00:28:25.912,00:28:28.456,Much stronger than that horned weakling I killed this morning.
00:28:31.417,00:28:32.460,That was his name.
00:28:32.543,00:28:36.672,"Well, lucky for us, he sold you out before I took his warlock mark."
00:28:40.343,00:28:42.929,Cat's eyes. Be a nice addition to my collection.
00:28:48.184,00:28:49.644,Well done.
00:28:50.645,00:28:52.188,More like medium-rare.
00:28:54.524,00:28:56.026,I'm Magnus.
00:28:56.109,00:28:58.069,I don't think we've been formally introduced.
00:28:58.694,00:29:00.071,Alec.
00:29:05.326,00:29:07.453,"Right, we should join the party."
00:29:07.537,00:29:08.579,Right.
00:29:13.752,00:29:15.128,This fight's far from over.
00:29:24.805,00:29:25.847,Magnus.
00:29:31.853,00:29:35.816,"Go join the others, my dear. This is no place for a little girl. Go."
00:29:43.865,00:29:47.202,You risked your life without hesitation to save a young warlock child.
00:29:48.119,00:29:50.288,She was just a girl and she was in trouble.
00:29:50.371,00:29:53.333,-I had no choice. -You always have a choice.
00:29:55.210,00:29:57.087,"You're not like the others, Clary Fairchild."
00:29:57.170,00:30:03.093,"Most Shadowhunters protect Downworlders out of sense of duty, but you saved young Zoe because of what was inside your heart."
00:30:04.803,00:30:06.471,You're more like your mother than you will ever know.
00:30:06.554,00:30:08.223,"Magnus, please..."
00:30:09.182,00:30:10.558,you can't hide from this battle.
00:30:10.641,00:30:13.478,"Look, Valentine, he found you once, he will find you again."
00:30:13.561,00:30:14.770,We need to work together.
00:30:14.855,00:30:16.272,Help me.
00:30:16.772,00:30:20.068,"I can summon the demon, but you must make the demand."
00:30:21.736,00:30:23.613,"Now, I warn you..."
00:30:23.696,00:30:26.157,retrieving your memories will not be easy.
00:30:27.658,00:30:29.995,-I will do what I have to do. -All right.
00:30:31.204,00:30:32.956,But we're not safe here.
00:30:33.039,00:30:35.125,The lair's location has been compromised.
00:30:35.750,00:30:38.294,"Hold tight, everyone, we're about to move."
00:31:02.944,00:31:04.195,"Hey, it's me."
00:31:05.196,00:31:06.489,I just...
00:31:07.740,00:31:09.450,I want to flat-out say I'm sorry.
00:31:10.701,00:31:15.165,I feel like crap for leaving you with Jace and those guys.
00:31:17.208,00:31:18.209,I don't know.
00:31:18.293,00:31:21.421,"Ever since we ditched those vampires, I've been feeling like crap a lot lately."
00:31:21.504,00:31:23.381,It's... these waves...
00:31:31.847,00:31:32.891,Anyway...
00:31:33.849,00:31:34.893,"Clary, you..."
00:31:35.894,00:31:38.688,You're the last person I'd ever want to leave in this world.
00:31:39.855,00:31:41.232,"I'm so, so sorry."
00:31:43.776,00:31:46.696,Call me back. Let me know you're okay.
00:31:47.780,00:31:48.990,Bye.
00:31:53.995,00:31:55.246,"Ugh, it's inevitable."
00:31:55.330,00:31:58.959,"After each move, I get the itch to redecorate."
00:31:59.042,00:32:03.379,"Normally, I love a dirty lair, but this is one is just sloppy."
00:32:14.307,00:32:16.809,Thank you for defending the warlocks.
00:32:21.356,00:32:22.482,And you should.
00:32:22.565,00:32:25.318,The Lightwoods have been wearing this for years.
00:32:28.363,00:32:31.449,"Besides, this would look silly on your brother."
00:32:35.161,00:32:39.249,"About Alec, is he more of a flower or a cologne man?"
00:32:40.416,00:32:42.835,"Okay, so how do we summon the memory demon?"
00:32:44.629,00:32:45.796,Are you certain?
00:32:46.922,00:32:49.050,Summoning such a powerful demon could be lethal.
00:32:49.134,00:32:51.802,I'll do anything to save my mother.
00:32:51.886,00:32:53.054,Where is the demon?
00:32:54.555,00:32:57.808,"Okay. Pretty boy, get your team ready."
00:33:00.103,00:33:02.813,I'm not talking to you.
00:33:02.897,00:33:04.440,I'm talking to...
00:33:04.524,00:33:05.733,you.
00:33:09.279,00:33:10.989,Come with me.
00:33:14.117,00:33:16.577,Everyone wants the Mortal Cup.
00:33:16.661,00:33:19.998,"Don't trust anyone, especially not the Clave."
00:33:20.706,00:33:22.625,Then why should I trust you?
00:33:22.708,00:33:24.460,You shouldn't.
00:33:33.761,00:33:37.098,These chalks are beautiful. What are they for?
00:33:37.182,00:33:41.269,"If a person wants their memories returned, they must draw the pentagram to summon the demon."
00:33:43.313,00:33:45.398,"I can walk you through it, if you like."
00:33:46.316,00:33:47.650,I got this.
00:33:50.861,00:33:52.322,Shadowhunter...
00:33:54.074,00:33:56.201,prepare Clary as best you can.
00:33:59.829,00:34:01.872,The memory demon is a Greater Demon.
00:34:02.915,00:34:05.876,The rune will be far more powerful than anything you've faced so far.
00:34:08.588,00:34:09.589,Do it.
00:34:13.843,00:34:15.220,This might sting.
00:34:33.488,00:34:35.115,I don't know about that.
00:34:35.198,00:34:40.786,"Oh, the only other person I've known who could draw as well was Michelangelo, who was excellent in bed, I might add."
00:34:49.254,00:34:50.921,We're ready.
00:34:51.005,00:34:53.424,Everyone take your rightful place on the pentagram.
00:34:54.509,00:34:56.261,-Um... -Here.
00:34:57.762,00:34:59.139,Thanks.
00:35:03.309,00:35:06.937,"Once this bond is sealed, it cannot be broken until the demon retreats."
00:35:07.021,00:35:12.318,"No matter what happens, we must not let go of each other's hands."
00:35:48.896,00:35:50.731,You people are pathetic.
00:36:01.033,00:36:06.664,"I will lead the ceremony, and you all must do exactly as I say."
00:36:06.747,00:36:09.041,The demon's name is Valak.
00:36:09.124,00:36:13.629,"And at some point, he will ask for payment in exchange for Clary's memories."
00:36:13.713,00:36:15.005,What do you mean? What kind of payment?
00:36:15.089,00:36:16.424,We will see.
00:36:17.592,00:36:18.843,Let us begin.
00:36:36.819,00:36:39.822,The necklace. It's pulsing.
00:36:50.541,00:36:53.669,Valak is among us. Do not break the bond.
00:36:53.753,00:36:55.421,-Hold on! -I'm trying.
00:36:55.963,00:36:59.342,"-It is time, the demon demands payment. -What does it want?"
00:36:59.425,00:37:03.012,We must each relinquish a beloved memory of the one we love the most.
00:37:22.698,00:37:26.577,"No, it's not true! The demon deceived me!"
00:37:26.661,00:37:29.163,"-Do not break the bond! -Alec, it's okay!"
00:37:29.247,00:37:30.790,-No! -Alec!
00:37:30.873,00:37:31.916,No!
00:37:56.857,00:37:57.858,Jace!
00:38:00.695,00:38:01.904,Grab him!
00:38:06.033,00:38:08.118,The demon is growing stronger!
00:38:09.662,00:38:11.831,Clary! Help us!
00:38:14.124,00:38:18.754,"Clary, if you kill the demon, your memories will be lost forever!"
00:38:20.506,00:38:21.632,Help us!
00:38:35.563,00:38:38.148,"-Oh, my God, Jace. -Jace, get up."
00:38:41.861,00:38:44.989,Does he normally just lay like that without moving?
00:38:49.660,00:38:52.413,-Get up. Jace. -Jace.
00:39:03.633,00:39:05.050,I'm all right.
00:39:05.134,00:39:06.594,I'm just getting my second wind.
00:39:10.014,00:39:14.644,"-There's nothing to be ashamed of, Alec. -I don't know what you're talking about."
00:39:14.727,00:39:15.811,You will.
00:39:18.898,00:39:22.317,"Thank God, you're okay. For a second there, I thought we lost you."
00:39:25.320,00:39:27.573,What's the count on how many times I saved your life?
00:39:43.798,00:39:46.175,-Hey. -Hey.
00:39:46.967,00:39:48.135,How you doin'?
00:39:48.218,00:39:50.513,-I'm fine. -Can I come in?
00:39:51.514,00:39:52.515,Yeah.
00:39:53.766,00:39:56.018,"You know, that move you did..."
00:39:56.101,00:39:58.688,"launching into the tornado, that was pretty impressive."
00:39:59.605,00:40:03.693,-You must have one hell of an instructor. -I didn't even know what I was doing.
00:40:05.528,00:40:06.654,I just acted.
00:40:07.112,00:40:08.322,Clary...
00:40:10.032,00:40:12.242,you killed one of the Greater Demons.
00:40:13.285,00:40:16.038,There's not a lot of Shadowhunters who can make that claim.
00:40:16.121,00:40:20.334,"Yeah, but in killing that demon, I lost my memories forever."
00:40:20.418,00:40:21.502,Yeah.
00:40:21.586,00:40:24.046,"I can't believe that... I'm never gonna find my mother, am I?"
00:40:24.129,00:40:25.130,Hey!
00:40:26.090,00:40:27.633,We will find her.
00:40:28.676,00:40:30.094,I promise.
00:40:31.261,00:40:32.722,"Get some sleep, okay?"
00:40:45.693,00:40:46.986,"Come on, Simon."
00:40:47.987,00:40:49.530,Pick up!
00:41:32.907,00:41:34.074,"Nice to see you, Clary."
00:41:39.163,00:41:40.706,You want your mother?
00:41:42.583,00:41:44.001,Give me the Cup!
00:41:52.885,00:41:54.595,Mom.
00:19:50.647,00:19:53.400,I offer you hope...
00:19:54.610,00:19:58.280,and a chance at a better life.
00:20:45.786,00:20:48.539,You will be free.
00:20:49.873,00:20:51.833,You will be free!
00:00:11.844,00:00:12.970,-Simon... -What?
00:00:13.055,00:00:14.222,"You were kidnapped by vampires, okay?"
00:00:14.306,00:00:16.349,You of all people should know how dangerous it is out there.
00:00:16.433,00:00:18.143,-I'll be fine. -Seelies have their charm.
00:00:18.226,00:00:20.687,Izzy can tell you all about them. She's got a thing.
00:00:20.770,00:00:22.730,"We've all got our things, don't we?"
00:00:24.316,00:00:27.360,We must each relinquish a beloved memory of the one we love the most.
00:00:30.905,00:00:33.116,Keep this with you and think of me when you wear it.
00:00:40.873,00:00:42.167,And he spoke to you?
00:00:42.250,00:00:43.876,He said my name.
00:00:50.007,00:00:51.968,And he can speak to you through that necklace?
00:00:52.051,00:00:53.052,"Here, in the Institute?"
00:00:53.136,00:00:54.387,It's like when I saw Dot.
00:00:54.471,00:00:56.389,It's a Portal shard.
00:00:56.473,00:00:58.641,That's why your mother made sure you had it.
00:00:58.725,00:01:00.935,All I know is what I saw...
00:01:01.018,00:01:02.437,My mother's alive.
00:01:02.520,00:01:04.314,"She's unconscious, but alive."
00:01:04.397,00:01:05.440,Where are they?
00:01:06.941,00:01:08.610,But you said you saw them.
00:01:08.693,00:01:10.445,Were there any identifying characteristics?
00:01:10.528,00:01:11.946,"Equipment, weapons, photographs?"
00:01:12.029,00:01:14.699,"-I don't remember. It was awful. -Alec, lighten up."
00:01:14.782,00:01:16.951,I'm trying to get something we can use out of this.
00:01:17.827,00:01:20.163,"Clary, what did you see, exactly?"
00:01:20.247,00:01:22.707,Valentine has my mother. That's what I saw.
00:01:22.790,00:01:25.543,Emotions are nothing but a distraction. You're ruled by them.
00:01:25.627,00:01:27.086,We're taught to control them.
00:01:27.170,00:01:28.796,And how is that working out for ya?
00:01:30.382,00:01:32.800,"If Valentine can see in, that's a door I have to shut."
00:01:32.884,00:01:36.846,Now... let me take a look at that thing.
00:01:44.521,00:01:45.688,"Now, it's in the proper hands."
00:01:46.856,00:01:48.358,Hey!
00:01:48.441,00:01:49.484,Alec...
00:01:49.567,00:01:51.111,where are you going?
00:01:51.194,00:01:53.821,To put this somewhere safe. Where no one could be tempted to use it.
00:01:56.032,00:01:57.742,"Alec, we should use it to get to Valentine."
00:01:57.825,00:02:01.204,"If I were Valentine, I'd make you think that you could rescue Jocelyn."
00:02:01.288,00:02:04.166,And then I'd lure Clary to me and leverage her life for the Cup.
00:02:07.294,00:02:08.878,We saved Simon from the vampires that way.
00:02:08.961,00:02:10.172,Yeah...
00:02:11.673,00:02:12.840,vampires.
00:02:12.924,00:02:16.261,"Bored, decadent, self-involved vampires."
00:02:19.639,00:02:21.141,Valentine is a real threat.
00:02:24.477,00:02:27.397,He can't be handled by three-and-a-half Shadowhunters.
00:02:27.480,00:02:29.524,-Four. -Whatever.
00:02:30.358,00:02:31.526,Leave it there.
00:02:51.588,00:02:52.964,There you are.
00:02:54.757,00:02:55.883,Are you okay?
00:02:57.427,00:02:59.011,I saw my mom.
00:02:59.095,00:03:01.389,-Then your brother-- -I heard.
00:03:01.473,00:03:04.351,"And believe me, there have been many times where I wanted to kill Alec."
00:03:11.441,00:03:14.902,"Look, I know my brother can be a real pain in the ass..."
00:03:16.821,00:03:18.740,That necklace is very dangerous.
00:03:18.823,00:03:20.283,I'll take the risk on my own.
00:03:20.367,00:03:22.869,"The problem is, you're not on your own, Clary."
00:03:26.831,00:03:28.207,I just-- I wish I knew what to do.
00:03:28.291,00:03:29.959,"All of this, it's so new to me."
00:03:30.042,00:03:31.711,I just...
00:03:33.671,00:03:35.131,I'll do anything to save her.
00:03:35.673,00:03:37.259,I get it.
00:03:37.342,00:03:38.760,You love her.
00:03:39.677,00:03:40.845,More than anything.
00:03:42.222,00:03:43.431,What's your mom like?
00:03:44.432,00:03:46.058,She's kind.
00:03:46.142,00:03:47.269,Fun.
00:03:47.352,00:03:50.355,Uh... the kinda person you always want to be around.
00:03:51.731,00:03:55.192,"My friends used to always want to hang out at our house, just to hang out with her."
00:03:56.653,00:03:59.239,She sounds more like a friend than a mom.
00:03:59.322,00:04:00.657,She was both.
00:04:01.491,00:04:06.663,"She's basically sacrificed her life for me, and I'm willing to do the same for her."
00:04:07.289,00:04:11.668,"Just because you can't have that necklace, doesn't mean you won't see her again."
00:04:14.546,00:04:16.714,Walk with me. Tell me everything about her.
00:04:22.053,00:04:24.431,"So, Alec blew right by you and did what he wanted."
00:04:24.514,00:04:25.765,"I'd be angry, too."
00:04:25.848,00:04:28.059,He took the only way I had to see my mother.
00:04:28.142,00:04:30.312,"Plus, he kept asking what Valentine's room looked like."
00:04:30.395,00:04:32.272,He was interested in Valentine's style?
00:04:33.690,00:04:37.444,"No, he thought I might have seen something that could help us find him."
00:04:37.527,00:04:38.903,And did you?
00:04:38.986,00:04:40.988,"I didn't see anything there, but..."
00:04:41.072,00:04:42.824,I think I might know another way.
00:04:47.662,00:04:48.996,Isabelle.
00:04:49.872,00:04:51.583,"Dressed to impress, I see."
00:04:51.666,00:04:55.337,And you've been playing with the family heirlooms.
00:04:55.420,00:04:56.754,"Hi, I'm Clary Fray."
00:04:56.838,00:04:58.548,Clary Fairchild.
00:05:00.425,00:05:01.759,We know all about you in Idris.
00:05:02.176,00:05:04.429,-Idris? -The Shadowhunter homeland.
00:05:04.512,00:05:07.432,"If you think the Institute is well-hidden, wait until you see that place."
00:05:08.099,00:05:10.226,How's Max? We all miss him.
00:05:10.935,00:05:12.645,Little brother. Cute but clingy.
00:05:12.729,00:05:14.063,Kinda Simon-ish.
00:05:14.146,00:05:15.982,Robert's picking him up at the Mumbai Institute.
00:05:16.065,00:05:19.402,Where's Jace? We have a situation that has to be handled now.
00:05:22.154,00:05:23.406,"Well, that's my mom."
00:05:49.599,00:05:51.308,Is your mom always like that?
00:05:53.352,00:05:55.104,Shadowhunters aren't big huggers.
00:06:07.742,00:06:09.326,How's everyone in Idris?
00:06:10.703,00:06:12.705,Just Mom with her hair on fire.
00:06:13.415,00:06:18.836,"I love how Shadowhunters share. A hidden brother, and a secret country, and a private Portal."
00:06:18.920,00:06:21.172,Mother. Welcome back. We didn't expect you.
00:06:21.255,00:06:24.383,"You should be prepared, whether you expect me or not."
00:06:24.467,00:06:26.969,I am. We are.
00:06:27.053,00:06:28.721,We'll talk about the Institute later.
00:06:28.805,00:06:30.765,"Right now, we have a bigger problem."
00:06:30.848,00:06:35.186,The Seelies have stopped communicating with the Clave and won't explain why.
00:06:35.978,00:06:42.318,"My guess is they're still upset we asked them to send scouts to look for Valentine, but no one in their realm will talk."
00:06:43.611,00:06:45.154,I have Seelie friends.
00:06:45.237,00:06:47.532,"Yes, I know about your friends."
00:06:51.118,00:06:55.247,"Isabelle, we stay separate from the Downworld for good reasons."
00:06:55.331,00:06:57.166,"The wrong move, the wrong word..."
00:06:57.249,00:06:59.586,Do you think there is such a thing as harmless rebellion?
00:07:01.713,00:07:03.339,Maybe you told him... them...
00:07:03.422,00:07:04.882,something they shouldn't know.
00:07:04.966,00:07:07.510,Maybe you trod on one of their ridiculous customs without knowing it.
00:07:09.637,00:07:11.889,You're laying all this on Izzy for having a friend in the Downworld?
00:07:11.973,00:07:14.851,"When someone upsets the natural order, everything falls apart."
00:07:14.934,00:07:17.103,Natural order? What are you saying?
00:07:19.897,00:07:21.483,I know how to talk to Seelies.
00:07:23.025,00:07:24.652,She can visit with Meliorn and see what he knows.
00:07:24.736,00:07:26.028,I could go with her if you want.
00:07:26.821,00:07:28.656,I'd rather Jace goes along this time.
00:07:31.951,00:07:33.327,I want her under control.
00:07:33.410,00:07:35.497,She's caused enough trouble already.
00:07:35.580,00:07:38.165,Maybe that's because I wasn't even a Shadowhunter until a few days ago!
00:07:38.249,00:07:40.543,And what an exciting few days it has been.
00:07:41.503,00:07:44.964,The Clave counts on us Lightwoods to maintain order here.
00:07:45.047,00:07:46.048,You don't need to tell me that.
00:07:52.388,00:07:53.389,It's time to face the truth.
00:07:53.473,00:07:56.684,"Life is not about what you want to do, it's about what must be done."
00:07:56.768,00:07:59.521,"I have given you your assignments, now carry them out."
00:07:59.604,00:08:02.273,"You and you, with me, now."
00:08:08.988,00:08:10.740,"Well, that was a window into the weird."
00:08:11.866,00:08:13.367,What did you do to piss off your mom?
00:08:13.450,00:08:15.870,"I'd guess, for a start..."
00:08:15.953,00:08:19.791,all the unsanctioned missions on your behalf didn't go over that big with the Clave.
00:08:38.685,00:08:39.936,Glad to see you're keeping busy.
00:08:40.019,00:08:42.730,Logging all these false confessions in the demonic murders.
00:08:42.814,00:08:46.358,Here's a lady in a fifth floor walkup in Bushwick with 15 cats.
00:08:46.442,00:08:47.819,Fifteen!
00:08:47.902,00:08:49.737,Demonic murders? You got anything?
00:08:50.404,00:08:54.617,"Apart from being drained of blood, it looked like there was no connection between any of the victims."
00:08:54.701,00:08:55.993,But check this out.
00:08:57.119,00:09:00.623,Everyone was getting treated for psychiatric care and taking meds for hallucinations.
00:09:01.583,00:09:03.125,What'd they see?
00:09:03.209,00:09:05.252,"Vampires, werewolves, demons."
00:09:05.336,00:09:06.462,The Shadow World.
00:09:09.465,00:09:11.008,Vic's drained of blood.
00:09:11.843,00:09:13.845,Looks like Valentine's been experimenting again...
00:09:15.930,00:09:17.389,What's his endgame?
00:09:17.473,00:09:21.352,"Before he found Jocelyn and Clary, I'd say he was building an army to go against the Clave."
00:09:21.435,00:09:23.688,But now he'll just use his soldiers to get the Mortal Cup.
00:09:23.771,00:09:25.397,And he'll destroy the Downworlds.
00:09:26.398,00:09:27.942,I've got to find Clary.
00:09:28.025,00:09:30.820,"Luke, we need you to keep your badge."
00:09:30.903,00:09:32.864,For everybody's sake.
00:09:32.947,00:09:34.448,This is coming from higher up than me.
00:09:34.531,00:09:36.283,Then you need to be my eyes and ears.
00:09:36.367,00:09:37.660,Go look for Clary.
00:09:37.744,00:09:39.328,"If you find anything, call me right away."
00:09:39.411,00:09:41.080,Valentine's desperate to find her.
00:09:41.163,00:09:43.791,Yeah. Him and everybody else.
00:09:43.875,00:09:44.959,I'll find her.
00:10:20.703,00:10:22.454,"If there's a diplomatic mission, you should go."
00:10:22.538,00:10:24.206,-Let's switch assignments. -Nope.
00:10:24.290,00:10:26.959,"This time I'm actually gonna obey orders, and babysit your girlfriend."
00:10:27.043,00:10:28.585,Clary?
00:10:28.670,00:10:30.504,She's more like my responsibility.
00:10:31.213,00:10:33.507,"Hey. Hey, you'll keep an eye on her, right?"
00:10:35.342,00:10:36.552,What is wrong with you?
00:10:40.181,00:10:41.432,"I, uh..."
00:10:46.729,00:10:48.314,What did you do?
00:10:48.397,00:10:50.107,Throw my leather jacket in the washing machine again?
00:10:50.191,00:10:51.818,This isn't a joke.
00:10:57.114,00:10:58.574,At Magnus's.
00:10:59.616,00:11:01.869,The demon... image of you.
00:11:02.912,00:11:03.996,That?
00:11:06.623,00:11:08.167,You love me... so?
00:11:09.460,00:11:11.087,"I love you, too, Alec."
00:11:13.089,00:11:15.174,"Come on, man. We're parabatai."
00:11:15.257,00:11:16.926,We're brothers.
00:11:17.009,00:11:18.427,We've spent almost our whole lives together.
00:11:18.510,00:11:20.179,How could we not love each other?
00:11:21.180,00:11:23.057,This is what's been bothering you? Seriously?
00:11:27.186,00:11:29.271,You're right. That's true.
00:11:31.273,00:11:32.775,What?
00:11:34.568,00:11:35.945,"Whatever, okay."
00:11:36.028,00:11:38.906,"If you want to follow Mom's orders tonight, that's great. But..."
00:11:40.032,00:11:41.743,"please, just do me one favor..."
00:11:42.409,00:11:44.536,Swear to me you won't take your eyes off of Clary.
00:11:46.873,00:11:48.207,I...
00:11:49.083,00:11:50.667,I can't believe I even asked you that.
00:12:06.600,00:12:09.270,Are you insane or just an idiot?
00:12:09.353,00:12:10.687,Huh?
00:12:10.772,00:12:12.398,"What are you after, anyway?"
00:12:13.983,00:12:16.027,To tell you the truth... I don't know.
00:12:17.403,00:12:20.782,You can't think I'm interested in saving your worthless life again?
00:12:21.240,00:12:23.492,"Honestly, no. No, I don't think that."
00:12:24.410,00:12:27.079,Get out of here and don't come back.
00:12:28.247,00:12:30.249,Go. Now.
00:12:45.056,00:12:47.558,"For what it's worth, I think your mom was too tough on you out there."
00:12:47.641,00:12:49.768,-Mothers are like that. -Mine's not.
00:12:50.686,00:12:52.980,Go ahead. Knock me on my ass. You'll feel better.
00:12:53.064,00:12:55.149,Don't make me say you're right about something.
00:12:55.232,00:12:56.692,Plant your feet wide.
00:12:57.484,00:12:59.528,Why did you let your mom say all those awful things about Izzy?
00:13:01.238,00:13:02.824,Don't step into the strike. Step through it.
00:13:04.992,00:13:06.618,The law is hard but it's the law.
00:13:06.702,00:13:08.370,Even I forget that sometimes.
00:13:08.454,00:13:10.331,"So, you're just gonna let her send Jace out instead of you?"
00:13:11.748,00:13:15.211,"If I screw up, I expect to be punished. I'm supposed to be a leader."
00:13:18.255,00:13:20.591,"You know what a leader does, Alec? Makes decisions."
00:13:20.674,00:13:22.676,You need to find Valentine and stop him.
00:13:22.759,00:13:25.221,I need to find Valentine and help save my mother.
00:13:36.815,00:13:38.525,You need to work on your defense.
00:13:41.403,00:13:43.364,Do you think we haven't been trying to find your mother?
00:13:43.447,00:13:44.615,Of course you have.
00:13:44.698,00:13:46.283,But I know you can color outside the lines.
00:13:46.367,00:13:47.784,You're just not letting yourself think that way.
00:13:47.869,00:13:50.246,"Oh, yeah? What's the big thought I'm not thinking?"
00:13:50.329,00:13:51.788,We can still find Valentine.
00:13:52.706,00:13:53.707,I might know a way.
00:13:57.086,00:13:58.837,there's a box.
00:14:03.425,00:14:06.220,-'Cause? -It belonged to my father.
00:14:06.971,00:14:09.015,"Had his initials, JC, on top."
00:14:09.932,00:14:12.559,But your father's Valentine. Why JC?
00:14:12.643,00:14:15.897,"Because for 18 years, she told me his name was Jonathan Clark."
00:14:19.150,00:14:20.651,meant a lot to her.
00:14:20.734,00:14:22.778,Maybe there's something inside that could help us track him.
00:14:23.570,00:14:24.821,Where can we find the box?
00:14:25.697,00:14:27.033,I think it's still back at the loft.
00:14:29.451,00:14:31.578,Absolutely not. Not without permission.
00:14:34.665,00:14:35.917,Just...
00:14:38.835,00:14:40.129,Hello? Who is this?
00:14:40.212,00:14:42.506,Alexander. Hi.
00:14:42.589,00:14:44.258,It's Magnus.
00:14:44.341,00:14:47.636,"We met the other day. You know, with the demon."
00:14:48.345,00:14:50.806,"Uh, yeah... Yeah, hey, what's up?"
00:14:50.890,00:14:54.393,I was just thinking it was really nice getting to know you.
00:14:54.476,00:14:57.063,You seem... sympathetic.
00:14:58.522,00:15:00.774,Would you like to go out for a drink some time?
00:15:04.861,00:15:05.988,When?
00:15:06.655,00:15:08.740,-How about right now? -Um...
00:15:10.701,00:15:12.119,"You know, now's not a really good time for me."
00:15:15.957,00:15:18.292,Playing hard to get.
00:15:18.375,00:15:20.294,I love a challenge.
00:15:50.782,00:15:52.034,You're late.
00:15:55.621,00:15:56.956,Beer.
00:16:09.885,00:16:11.095,I don't.
00:16:11.178,00:16:12.888,They all look the same to me.
00:16:14.598,00:16:16.933,Shadowhunters think they're better than us.
00:16:17.018,00:16:19.145,They're the ones killing each other over petty disagreements.
00:16:21.813,00:16:23.857,Is that who you trust with the Mortal Cup?
00:16:23.940,00:16:27.153,They expect us to obey orders they don't follow themselves.
00:16:27.236,00:16:28.904,I'm sick of it.
00:16:28.988,00:16:31.573,"Yeah, maybe we don't have angel blood."
00:16:31.657,00:16:33.034,We got each other.
00:16:33.993,00:16:36.953,We're a family. A pack.
00:16:37.038,00:16:38.622,We're stronger than they'll ever be.
00:16:38.705,00:16:40.916,"I say, we take the Cup for ourselves."
00:16:43.835,00:16:45.587,This girl knows where the Cup is.
00:16:45.671,00:16:47.964,Find her. Bring her to me.
00:17:14.991,00:17:18.579,And what's the point of an Invisibility rune if you don't silence your phone?
00:17:18.662,00:17:20.581,"That was childish, sneaking out like that..."
00:17:20.664,00:17:23.667,Simon. Hey. I know I should have called you right back.
00:17:23.750,00:17:25.252,I'm really sorry. Are you okay?
00:17:27.963,00:17:29.465,but you never actually get sick?
00:17:29.548,00:17:30.591,"Yeah, I totally get it."
00:17:30.674,00:17:33.469,"Um, can we talk later? Things are kind of insane right now."
00:17:33.552,00:17:34.886,"Insane, how? Are you okay?"
00:17:34.970,00:17:38.807,I... I kind of killed a demon and lost all my memories forever. So...
00:17:38.890,00:17:40.142,You killed a what?
00:17:40.226,00:17:41.852,"Okay, Clary, where are you?"
00:17:41.935,00:17:43.395,I'm at the Brooklyn Academy.
00:17:43.479,00:17:44.563,-I'm on my way to-- -Hang up.
00:17:44.646,00:17:47.816,"-That's it, we have to go. Right now. -No. I'm on my way to the loft."
00:17:47.899,00:17:50.111,There's something there that I think could help me find my mother.
00:17:50.194,00:17:51.195,Are you crazy?
00:17:51.278,00:17:53.739,That's way too dangerous. You think nobody's watching that place?
00:17:53.822,00:17:55.199,I'm fine. I'm with Alec.
00:17:55.282,00:17:57.659,And those words are supposed to make me feel better how?
00:17:57.743,00:17:59.328,"Yeah, I'm coming to help."
00:17:59.411,00:18:01.455,"No, Simon, you've been through enough already."
00:18:01.538,00:18:03.374,So have you. Meet me at the old shortcut. You know the one.
00:18:07.086,00:18:09.213,Mundanes. Look at them.
00:18:09.296,00:18:10.672,Running around like ants.
00:18:11.465,00:18:13.842,-Let's go. -Why do you always look so miserable?
00:18:15.177,00:18:16.512,-I don't. -You do.
00:18:17.053,00:18:20.182,It must be hard being in love with Jace and he's straight and everything.
00:18:21.725,00:18:23.810,Excuse me? What?
00:18:25.146,00:18:27.773,"I was there when that memory came out. Busted, no?"
00:18:27.856,00:18:29.275,We're parabatai.
00:18:29.358,00:18:32.694,"Alec, just say it, you'll feel better. You're in love with Jace."
00:18:32.778,00:18:34.946,Forget it. You know what? You're in love with Jace.
00:18:35.030,00:18:37.073,"Oh, okay? The middle school comeback? Nice."
00:18:38.325,00:18:40.286,"Alec, we have a real problem to solve, okay?"
00:18:40.369,00:18:41.745,Come with me.
00:18:43.664,00:18:45.166,This better be quick.
00:18:51.255,00:18:53.840,We mourn those in the path of souls.
00:19:10.274,00:19:11.567,Isabelle.
00:19:16.655,00:19:18.114,More like a brother.
00:19:19.115,00:19:20.367,Jace Wayland.
00:19:21.660,00:19:23.162,Here to deliver a message?
00:19:23.954,00:19:25.331,Here to ask questions.
00:19:26.873,00:19:28.542,So you do want something.
00:19:29.376,00:19:31.044,Nice to know that some things never change.
00:19:31.503,00:19:34.130,But the information we want will cost you nothing.
00:19:34.840,00:19:37.384,Sometimes knowledge is the most precious thing of all.
00:19:37.468,00:19:39.220,Ask away.
00:19:39.720,00:19:41.347,We can discuss the price later.
00:19:48.270,00:19:50.272,Humankind has failed you.
00:20:03.702,00:20:05.787,May the bravest of you step forward.
00:20:06.913,00:20:11.710,Take the mark of the angels and live a life with a future again.
00:20:36.818,00:20:38.194,And now the Seelie blood.
00:20:39.946,00:20:41.907,You shall be more than Forsaken.
00:21:08.141,00:21:11.270,He will live in the glory of angels.
00:21:21.988,00:21:23.657,"Hey, you."
00:21:23.740,00:21:25.033,"Oh, thanks for being here."
00:21:25.951,00:21:27.744,You don't need to do this alone.
00:21:29.955,00:21:30.956,It's not who we are.
00:21:31.039,00:21:33.417,Are you sure you're feeling up to this?
00:21:33.500,00:21:35.544,"Yeah, it's just a cold. Not the end of the world."
00:21:35.627,00:21:37.087,The world's been ending for a thousand years.
00:21:37.170,00:21:39.214,"Ah, you get used to it. Now, we need to move."
00:21:39.298,00:21:41.091,"Yeah, my mom's loft is just across the alley."
00:21:41.174,00:21:42.801,"All right, well, we have to be careful."
00:21:42.884,00:21:45.637,There are eyes all over this place and everybody in the Shadow World's looking for you.
00:21:45.721,00:21:48.640,"I mean, I guarantee you, no one's gonna find this shortcut."
00:21:48.724,00:21:51.142,I used to take it back in middle school to see Clary.
00:21:51.226,00:21:54.145,"You might know the Shadow World, but trust me..."
00:21:54.229,00:21:55.689,I know Brooklyn. Come on.
00:22:23.800,00:22:25.260,You've gotten a lot better at this.
00:22:28.346,00:22:31.141,Climbing a fire escape excites mundanes.
00:22:31.224,00:22:33.018,I'll never understand these people.
00:22:35.061,00:22:36.229,Whoa!
00:22:36.980,00:22:38.815,I don't remember it like this.
00:22:39.441,00:22:42.569,These are runes and wards of protection cast by a warlock.
00:22:43.319,00:22:44.571,Dot.
00:22:46.072,00:22:47.741,Some of these have been here for years.
00:22:48.324,00:22:51.036,The only difference is now I can actually see them.
00:22:53.079,00:22:54.456,What are all these tags?
00:22:54.540,00:22:56.082,You can see the runes?
00:22:56.166,00:22:58.419,"Yeah, kind of hard to miss."
00:22:58.502,00:23:00.421,For a Shadowhunter.
00:23:00.504,00:23:02.673,They should be invisible to most mundanes.
00:23:02.756,00:23:04.174,When did you get the Sight?
00:23:06.217,00:23:08.470,But whoever drew these should take some lessons from Clary.
00:23:08.554,00:23:10.931,"Their, uh, work is pretty sloppy."
00:23:11.932,00:23:14.685,This is from when Simon and I were engaged to be married.
00:23:16.895,00:23:19.940,I'm almost certain I don't wanna hear this story-- We were eight years old.
00:23:20.649,00:23:22.443,That was a whole other world ago.
00:23:34.830,00:23:36.540,"There's only one flaw in your plan here, Simon."
00:23:36.623,00:23:38.041,"Here, let me try."
00:23:44.130,00:23:45.757,After you.
00:23:45.841,00:23:47.092,Okay.
00:23:48.635,00:23:51.304,Ooh. After me.
00:23:59.980,00:24:01.982,"Holy crap, Clary. Who torched your loft?"
00:24:02.899,00:24:04.442,"Yeah, I can see this, too."
00:24:09.906,00:24:11.116,Hey.
00:24:12.200,00:24:13.326,You okay?
00:24:14.661,00:24:16.538,There's nothing left of me here.
00:24:21.417,00:24:23.253,"Of course, there isn't."
00:24:23.336,00:24:26.297,Your mother was trying to erase any trace that you existed.
00:24:26.381,00:24:27.966,So that you couldn't be tracked.
00:24:29.885,00:24:31.386,Let's see how well that worked.
00:24:36.224,00:24:37.768,These floorboards...
00:24:41.354,00:24:43.148,They sound different in these two spots.
00:24:46.109,00:24:47.569,Can't you hear it?
00:24:49.863,00:24:51.489,There's something under here.
00:25:03.544,00:25:05.170,Another score for Brooklyn.
00:25:05.253,00:25:07.338,"Hey, out of the way."
00:25:08.298,00:25:09.465,You're welcome.
00:25:22.854,00:25:24.105,Is this the box you remember?
00:25:24.856,00:25:26.567,Yeah.
00:25:26.650,00:25:29.695,She used to wait till she thought I was asleep and then take it out.
00:25:32.072,00:25:33.448,"Well, let's open it."
00:25:40.496,00:25:42.457,I don't know what any of this is.
00:25:48.254,00:25:49.464,There's someone here.
00:25:49.547,00:25:52.342,Get what you need. Do not move until I get back.
00:25:52.425,00:25:53.885,We've been here too long.
00:27:03.038,00:27:05.832,Is it true that your queen has broken off communications with the Clave?
00:27:07.292,00:27:08.418,Yes.
00:27:09.460,00:27:12.213,Does it have anything to do with the scouts you sent out after Valentine?
00:27:12.297,00:27:14.215,Is there another reason you can think of?
00:27:14.925,00:27:17.010,Butterflies can mean only one thing...
00:27:19.179,00:27:21.389,Fair Folk are in mourning.
00:27:21.472,00:27:22.515,How do you know our customs?
00:27:23.433,00:27:27.145,"Apparently, I'm not the only Shadowhunter who enjoys the company of a Fair Folk."
00:27:28.521,00:27:33.318,Maybe if more Shadowhunters exhibited such good taste things would be different today.
00:27:36.780,00:27:38.824,That's who you're mourning.
00:27:38.907,00:27:40.241,"Valentine killed them, right?"
00:27:40.325,00:27:43.244,"If you know so much, maybe I should be asking you."
00:27:43.328,00:27:46.122,"If that's true, Valentine needs to be stopped."
00:27:46.707,00:27:48.374,Don't you agree?
00:27:48.458,00:27:50.501,Why break the Accords now when there's a threat?
00:27:50.585,00:27:55.340,Perhaps the Accords don't provide equal protection for all Shadow Realms.
00:27:55.423,00:27:58.259,Perhaps all threats don't affect all of us the same way.
00:27:58.343,00:28:00.804,Valentine threatens everyone.
00:28:02.806,00:28:05.600,Those who antagonize an enemy stand to lose more.
00:28:05.683,00:28:08.519,Which is another way of saying you'll side with whoever wins.
00:28:10.188,00:28:12.315,"I promise you, that will be us."
00:28:14.150,00:28:15.944,I'm sure you believe that.
00:28:22.283,00:28:23.493,"Damn it, Alec."
00:28:23.576,00:28:24.828,What?
00:28:24.911,00:28:27.080,Clary snuck out of the Institute.
00:28:27.163,00:28:29.040,And yet you're blaming our brother?
00:28:29.124,00:28:30.458,Fascinating.
00:28:41.720,00:28:43.638,Where is she? Where's Clary?
00:28:43.722,00:28:44.931,She's gone.
00:28:45.015,00:28:46.224,"What do you mean, gone?"
00:28:46.307,00:28:49.185,She and Simon got arrested when I was securing the fire escape.
00:28:52.397,00:28:53.648,"He's gone, too?"
00:28:53.732,00:28:56.401,It was an unmarked car. I don't know where they took her.
00:28:56.484,00:28:58.403,"What did you do, Alec?"
00:29:21.051,00:29:22.593,Just cooperate and everything will be fine.
00:29:22.677,00:29:23.719,Get out!
00:29:27.891,00:29:29.893,Be quiet or you're gonna make this worse for yourself.
00:29:32.062,00:29:33.104,"Alaric, who is this guy?"
00:29:33.188,00:29:35.982,-Luke's calling. -Ignore it. That's an order.
00:29:36.066,00:29:37.317,Are you guys with Luke?
00:29:37.400,00:29:38.860,-Did he send you? -None of your business.
00:29:51.957,00:29:53.959,She's not showing up.
00:29:54.042,00:29:56.002,We need to parabatai track.
00:30:13.061,00:30:14.687,"Alec, concentrate."
00:30:23.029,00:30:24.030,Alec!
00:30:24.114,00:30:26.782,I'm doing it. She's not showing up.
00:30:32.288,00:30:33.539,It was your job to look after her.
00:30:33.623,00:30:37.043,"-I did my best, Jace. -Then maybe your mother was right, and your best is just isn't good enough."
00:30:37.127,00:30:38.169,-Jace! -Hey!
00:30:38.253,00:30:40.630,"Are you so blinded by your feelings for Clary, you've lost sight of us?"
00:30:44.134,00:30:45.260,Clary snuck out.
00:30:46.219,00:30:48.972,I went after her... to protect her.
00:30:49.055,00:30:51.099,I did nothing you haven't done a thousand times before.
00:30:51.182,00:30:53.601,"Yes, you did. You lost her."
00:30:53.684,00:30:55.811,"Enough, both of you."
00:31:02.235,00:31:03.403,Why do I keep getting kidnapped?
00:31:03.486,00:31:05.655,"Not to be self-centered, but I think it's me they're after."
00:31:11.995,00:31:13.246,"Okay, what is going on?"
00:31:13.329,00:31:18.168,"Alaric, did you arrest us for trespassing or something, because, news flash, I was in my own apartment."
00:31:18.251,00:31:20.128,"We're just having a little conversation, that's all."
00:31:20.211,00:31:22.130,Do you always handcuff people you wanna talk to?
00:31:22.213,00:31:24.424,I bet this guy has one of the scariest online profiles ever.
00:31:24.507,00:31:27.468,This guy's funny. I like funny.
00:31:27.552,00:31:29.720,"Look, I know you're scared of Luke."
00:31:29.804,00:31:31.764,"He's trying to find you, I can keep you safe."
00:31:31.847,00:31:33.975,You just need to tell us where the Mortal Cup is.
00:31:34.059,00:31:37.562,"Everyone thinks I can find this Cup, but I don't know where it is!"
00:31:37.645,00:31:40.106,"Think, Clary. I'm trying to give you a chance."
00:31:40.190,00:31:42.150,I can't help you. I'm sorry.
00:31:42.233,00:31:43.484,"Now, will you please let us go?"
00:31:44.027,00:31:45.236,Playtime's over.
00:31:45.320,00:31:47.530,"Theo, just let me talk some sense into them."
00:31:47.613,00:31:50.033,"No, we did it your way. Now, we're gonna try it my way."
00:31:50.116,00:31:51.534,What?
00:31:51.617,00:31:53.328,"-Hey, hey-- -Hey, don't touch him!"
00:31:53.411,00:31:56.831,Don't move. Tell us where the Cup is or your funny friend dies.
00:32:04.630,00:32:06.341,That's too bad. Get rid of him.
00:32:06.424,00:32:08.593,"-What? Hey, let go of me! -Simon!"
00:32:08.676,00:32:11.346,"-Get your hands off me! Clary! -Please, wait, don't hurt him."
00:32:11.429,00:32:13.764,-No! -Clary!
00:32:13.848,00:32:17.727,"Please, wait! Simon... no!"
00:32:24.234,00:32:26.069,"Please, tell me if Simon's okay."
00:32:30.865,00:32:33.701,-Thank God. -You can thank whoever you want.
00:32:33.784,00:32:36.204,But if you don't tell us where the Cup is...
00:32:36.287,00:32:38.289,we're gonna introduce Gretel here to your friend.
00:32:39.665,00:32:41.459,She's one of our fiercest warriors.
00:32:42.961,00:32:44.420,She'll rip him to shreds.
00:32:53.096,00:32:56.516,And your friend is dog meat if you don't give us the Cup.
00:33:06.234,00:33:08.861,Okay! Okay...
00:33:08.944,00:33:09.988,You win.
00:33:11.031,00:33:13.158,"I'll tell you where the Cup is, just..."
00:33:13.241,00:33:14.784,"Just please, let Simon go."
00:33:15.951,00:33:17.287,I'm listening.
00:33:18.913,00:33:20.331,"It's, uh..."
00:33:20.415,00:33:22.500,It's in the loft where you found me.
00:33:26.004,00:33:28.423,"My mom didn't know I knew, but she hid it there."
00:33:32.760,00:33:34.220,Bring me the Cup.
00:33:38.183,00:33:39.850,If you're lying...
00:33:40.768,00:33:42.437,I'm not just gonna kill your friend...
00:33:42.978,00:33:46.732,I'm gonna make you watch as Gretel rips him to shreds.
00:33:49.944,00:33:52.530,This... again?
00:34:27.523,00:34:29.067,Lighter...
00:34:36.157,00:34:38.909,"Who do I call? Simon, think. Who do you call?"
00:34:42.288,00:34:44.582,That's why our Tracking rune won't work.
00:34:46.126,00:34:47.335,Clary left her phone in her backpack.
00:34:58.096,00:34:59.305,"It's me, Simon."
00:34:59.389,00:35:00.598,Where are you? Where's Clary?
00:35:00.681,00:35:03.684,"I don't know. Some Chinese restaurant, I think?"
00:35:03.768,00:35:06.812,"This cop Alaric arrested us, but it was a total fake-out."
00:35:06.896,00:35:08.106,"Him and his buddy, they took us..."
00:35:08.189,00:35:10.941,They us to their hangout and then they told Clary that they'll kill her if they don't find the Cup.
00:35:11.025,00:35:13.361,"Just calm down, all right? Tell us what you see."
00:35:13.444,00:35:16.030,Okay. Uh...
00:35:16.114,00:35:18.574,"Uh, we're definitely on a pier."
00:35:18.658,00:35:19.950,There's a ton of water. Uh...
00:35:20.034,00:35:21.702,I see lockers and...
00:35:24.997,00:35:26.624,I'm in some sort of torture chamber.
00:35:26.707,00:35:28.293,There's claw marks all over the wall.
00:35:28.376,00:35:29.752,Werewolves.
00:35:29.835,00:35:31.003,That's possible.
00:35:32.004,00:35:35.550,"Okay, Simon, you need to get more specific. Tell us what you see."
00:35:35.633,00:35:39.845,"-Help us find you. -There's nothing else that can help-- Wait, hold on! Hold on."
00:35:42.182,00:35:44.809,I'm at the Jade Wolf Chinese Restaurant on the pier at Greene St.
00:35:44.892,00:35:46.977,And they have really inexpensive cocktails.
00:35:47.061,00:35:48.229,"Just hurry, just hurry."
00:35:48.313,00:35:49.647,You need to create a diversion.
00:35:49.730,00:35:50.773,Stall them.
00:35:50.856,00:35:53.651,How? All I have are clothes and a lighter.
00:36:09.917,00:36:11.419,What's taking them so long?
00:36:22.888,00:36:24.974,It's a fire. Find it!
00:36:25.057,00:36:26.976,I'll take care of the girl. Go.
00:36:33.774,00:36:35.276,Where's Simon?
00:37:11.271,00:37:12.688,"I finally found you, Clary."
00:37:19.404,00:37:20.696,You stay away from me!
00:37:20.780,00:37:21.822,Don't be afraid.
00:37:21.906,00:37:24.409,I traced Alaric's car to the pier when he didn't return my calls.
00:37:26.118,00:37:27.787,I heard what you said at the precinct.
00:37:27.870,00:37:30.290,You told those creeps the last 18 years of your life were a lie.
00:37:30.373,00:37:32.166,Those were Valentine's people.
00:37:32.250,00:37:33.834,I lied to them to protect you.
00:37:34.877,00:37:36.086,Don't come any closer.
00:37:36.796,00:37:38.756,"You want the Mortal Cup, just like everyone else."
00:37:40.341,00:37:43.177,"Yeah, but I already stabbed one demon with it."
00:37:43.261,00:37:44.929,I'm sure it hurts a lot worse on a man.
00:37:45.012,00:37:48.140,-Hey! -You need more training.
00:37:48.223,00:37:50.100,And we gotta go. Now!
00:37:53.896,00:37:56.357,-Where are you taking me? -Someplace safe.
00:37:56.441,00:37:58.276,These people aren't messing around. They will kill you.
00:38:07.242,00:38:08.869,-You okay? -I will be.
00:38:08.953,00:38:10.413,-As soon as we find Simon. -Come on.
00:38:25.886,00:38:28.931,I'm getting seriously tired of saving your life.
00:38:29.014,00:38:30.600,I am not!
00:38:39.191,00:38:45.656,"I hate to break up this little reunion, but we got a bunch of werewolves trying to kill us so maybe we should get going-- Wait, wait, the box. My backpack. I think I left it at the loft."
00:38:45.740,00:38:47.157,"No, we've got it. I didn't screw up everything."
00:38:47.241,00:38:49.577,"-Let's get out of here, then. -Wait, Simon!"
00:38:49.660,00:38:52.246,"Whatever you do, do not make any fast moves."
00:38:56.709,00:38:58.002,This can't be good.
00:39:12.642,00:39:14.059,"Everyone, stay together."
00:39:14.143,00:39:15.978,"Believe me, I'm not going anywhere."
00:39:18.981,00:39:20.941,"Everyone, get back, that's the alpha leader."
00:39:39.460,00:39:42.004,-He's challenging the alpha. -He's helping us!
00:39:42.087,00:39:43.673,Or cutting in line to kill us.
00:40:06.111,00:40:07.613,"Oh, my God, Luke."
00:40:12.743,00:40:13.869,What?
00:40:21.335,00:40:22.753,What is it? What's happening?
00:40:24.254,00:40:27.883,"When a werewolf kills the alpha leader, he becomes the new alpha."
00:40:27.967,00:40:30.553,Your friend Luke's the leader of the pack now.
00:40:36.141,00:40:37.184,Clary...
00:40:40.229,00:40:42.272,-No. -It's okay.
00:40:47.069,00:40:49.614,I promised your mother I'd always protect you.
00:40:53.283,00:40:54.284,"Luke! Oh, my God!"
00:40:55.495,00:40:57.329,Hey...
00:40:57.412,00:41:00.249,we need to get Clary back to the Institute and stay out of Downworlder business.
00:41:00.332,00:41:02.918,Why don't you stay out of it? I'm going to help Clary.
00:41:04.879,00:41:07.632,-We have to report back to our mother. -You and Isabelle can do that.
00:41:09.592,00:41:10.801,I'll be fine on my own.
00:41:14.972,00:41:16.641,His wounds are deep.
00:41:17.808,00:41:19.894,Only a warlock's magic can cure an alpha's bite.
00:41:19.977,00:41:21.521,We have to get him to Magnus.
00:41:21.604,00:41:23.689,"Hey, that's exactly what we're gonna do."
00:41:33.699,00:41:35.701,I'm the only one with a mundane license. Come on.
00:41:42.041,00:41:43.543,Are you two okay?
00:41:45.002,00:41:46.295,I don't know.
00:41:49.632,00:41:51.216,I never should have doubted you.
00:41:51.300,00:41:52.968,We never should have lied to you.
00:42:04.104,00:42:05.105,Luke.
00:42:05.189,00:42:06.231,"Luke, hey!"
00:42:06.315,00:42:08.192,"It's okay. We're getting you help, okay?"
00:42:08.275,00:42:10.277,"Just, please, don't leave me again."
00:42:11.696,00:42:13.864,I can't have anyone else die because of me.
00:00:14.847,00:00:16.224,Is this the box you remember?
00:00:18.726,00:00:19.727,Alaric!
00:00:19.811,00:00:22.147,"Damn it, Alec. Clary snuck out of the Institute."
00:00:22.230,00:00:24.399,-I don't know where they took her. -What did you do?
00:00:24.482,00:00:26.484,You just need to tell us where the Mortal Cup is.
00:00:26.568,00:00:27.652,I don't know where it is.
00:00:27.735,00:00:29.321,Would you like to go out for a drink sometime?
00:00:30.905,00:00:32.532,I love a challenge.
00:00:32.615,00:00:34.701,-Simon! -Get your hands off me! Clary!
00:00:35.993,00:00:37.370,"I finally found you, Clary."
00:00:38.246,00:00:39.247,That's the alpha leader.
00:00:41.041,00:00:43.710,"When a werewolf kills the alpha leader, he becomes the new alpha."
00:00:43.793,00:00:45.670,Your friend Luke's the leader of the pack now.
00:00:45.753,00:00:48.340,"Oh, my God! We have to get him to Magnus."
00:00:48.423,00:00:50.049,That's exactly what we're gonna do.
00:01:04.814,00:01:07.109,Where are... where are you? Where are you?
00:01:11.654,00:01:12.697,Where are you?
00:01:13.698,00:01:14.824,Jocelyn!
00:01:18.411,00:01:19.704,Jocelyn!
00:01:22.874,00:01:24.542,Where are you?
00:01:28.921,00:01:31.048,-I missed you. -I'm here now.
00:01:32.217,00:01:33.760,I've been waiting for you.
00:01:35.303,00:01:36.429,But I can't stay.
00:01:37.722,00:01:39.724,-Why? -You know why.
00:01:40.683,00:01:42.018,Tell me how to get you back.
00:01:42.519,00:01:44.604,Clary's the key.
00:01:44.687,00:01:45.938,You have to help her.
00:01:46.022,00:01:48.316,You have to unlock her.
00:01:48.400,00:01:50.402,-Tell her everything. -I can't.
00:01:50.485,00:01:52.820,"You have to, or she'll never find the Cup."
00:01:52.904,00:01:54.822,She has to find the Cup.
00:01:54.906,00:01:55.990,To save you?
00:01:56.073,00:01:58.910,No. To stop Valentine.
00:01:59.452,00:02:01.288,-Jocelyn! -Help her.
00:02:04.124,00:02:05.292,Wait!
00:02:07.585,00:02:10.046,"No, Luke, it's Clary. Can you hear me?"
00:02:10.130,00:02:12.006,"Clary, listen to me."
00:02:12.089,00:02:13.633,Listen... You have to listen to me.
00:02:13.716,00:02:17.011,"I have to tell you, just in case-- -No, don't even say it, don't. -No, listen to me."
00:02:17.094,00:02:20.765,"-Luke. -No, you need to know! Listen-- -Was he bitten by an alpha? -Yeah, why?"
00:02:20.848,00:02:22.809,"Three, two, one..."
00:02:37.031,00:02:38.074,Where do you think you're going?
00:02:41.703,00:02:43.580,We don't have a lot of time.
00:02:46.291,00:02:48.042,It'll take a few moments to take effect.
00:02:48.125,00:02:49.252,What's happening to him?
00:02:51.296,00:02:53.298,It's a side effect of the poison in the alpha bite.
00:02:59.053,00:03:01.598,You're sure the Seelies think Valentine killed their scouts?
00:03:01.681,00:03:03.600,It's why they've broken off contact with the Clave.
00:03:03.683,00:03:05.059,They're considering switching sides.
00:03:05.142,00:03:06.311,That's totally irrational.
00:03:06.394,00:03:08.145,It's self-preservation.
00:03:08.230,00:03:09.647,They think Valentine can win.
00:03:10.357,00:03:12.525,Seelies always want to be on the winning side.
00:03:12.609,00:03:15.320,Never trust a people who can't lie.
00:03:15.403,00:03:17.947,They find much more inventive ways to stab you in the back.
00:03:36.674,00:03:37.717,You okay?
00:03:39.051,00:03:40.220,Hey...
00:03:45.141,00:03:46.476,I know how much he means to you.
00:03:49.354,00:03:51.147,How could I have doubted him?
00:03:51.231,00:03:53.775,"Simon, he's... He's the only father I've ever known."
00:03:57.529,00:03:59.447,I get a good vibe from this Magnus Bane guy.
00:03:59.531,00:04:00.615,He seems like he knows what he's doing.
00:04:00.698,00:04:05.912,"The bark will stop the transformation for now, but Luke needs an antidote to stop the poison in his system."
00:04:05.995,00:04:07.997,And I don't have all the ingredients here.
00:04:08.080,00:04:09.874,Just tell me what you need and how to get it.
00:04:09.957,00:04:11.293,"No, you stay here."
00:04:11.376,00:04:13.878,-Luke will need you if he wakes up. -When he wakes up.
00:04:13.961,00:04:15.212,-I'll go. -I'll go.
00:04:15.297,00:04:17.840,"Jace, what happened to you?"
00:04:17.924,00:04:21.678,Luke's car may have found its way into a pole while I was stashing it.
00:04:21.761,00:04:23.179,I don't do mundane driving.
00:04:23.263,00:04:24.681,"Yeah, apparently."
00:04:26.308,00:04:28.435,"-What do you need for the antidote? -Hey, I got this."
00:04:28.518,00:04:31.604,"Phoenix eyes, moon salt, and Idris fulgurite."
00:04:31.688,00:04:33.606,"One trip to the pharmacy, it'll take two seconds."
00:04:33.690,00:04:36.484,"I know a guy. And, uh... I don't need him."
00:04:37.151,00:04:40.322,Too bad. You're getting me. We'll be right back.
00:04:40.405,00:04:42.073,One more thing.
00:04:42.156,00:04:43.575,I need Alexander.
00:04:44.116,00:04:45.201,"Uh, why do you need Alec?"
00:04:45.910,00:04:47.370,Virgin Shadowhunter energy.
00:04:51.999,00:04:54.627,"-I can't. -Jace, just ask, please."
00:04:54.711,00:04:55.878,You guys need to talk.
00:04:57.464,00:04:59.466,Trouble in paradise?
00:05:08.850,00:05:10.477,Mom's in rare form today.
00:05:12.729,00:05:15.690,If you say so. Same old judgmental Mom with me.
00:05:27.577,00:05:28.661,What are you doing back so soon?
00:05:28.745,00:05:30.204,Got in trouble in Mumbai.
00:05:30.287,00:05:31.831,"-Oh, what'd you do? -Nothing."
00:05:31.914,00:05:34.334,He started a fire with his stele during rune studies.
00:05:37.920,00:05:39.797,I was trying to draw the Nourishment rune.
00:05:39.881,00:05:41.841,"Those two runes look nothing alike, Max."
00:05:41.924,00:05:43.009,"Well, they do to me."
00:05:43.092,00:05:46.804,"Max, go up to your room, open the Gray Book and look up the Extinguish rune."
00:05:53.144,00:05:55.772,Where is Clary Fairchild? Your mother said she's missing.
00:05:55.855,00:05:58.024,She's not missing. She's with Jace.
00:05:58.107,00:05:59.734,We can't have that girl out of Institute control.
00:06:02.236,00:06:04.447,It's a security risk. Get them both back here now.
00:06:05.740,00:06:07.074,You need to get back to the Institute.
00:06:07.158,00:06:08.618,You need to help me first.
00:06:08.701,00:06:10.953,"-No, I'm not messing around. -Me either."
00:06:11.037,00:06:12.038,I need your help.
00:06:12.121,00:06:14.290,-You okay? -I'm fine. It's Magnus.
00:06:14.373,00:06:17.835,"He needs your powerful Shadowhunter energy, or something like that."
00:06:20.212,00:06:22.131,To help save Luke's life.
00:06:22.214,00:06:24.801,"No, I told you at the wolf den, no more Downworlder business."
00:06:24.884,00:06:27.429,We can't be seen as interfering with a pack alpha dispute.
00:06:27.512,00:06:30.181,"-How can you even ask me-- -I shouldn't have to ask you, Alec."
00:06:30.264,00:06:32.517,-We're parabatai. -That's exactly my point.
00:06:32.600,00:06:37.229,"Alec, you're a man of honor, and the only person in the world I would trust with something like this."
00:06:37.313,00:06:39.732,I'm counting on you to do the right thing.
00:06:45.237,00:06:46.489,What's all this for?
00:06:46.573,00:06:48.199,The base for the potion.
00:06:51.327,00:06:54.914,Stir. We need to have it ready before your boy toys get back.
00:06:54.997,00:06:56.583,What if they don't get back in time?
00:06:56.666,00:06:58.543,"You can't think like that, biscuit."
00:06:58.626,00:07:00.294,That's all I can think about.
00:07:03.548,00:07:05.550,"Magnus, I don't know if I can do this anymore."
00:07:05.633,00:07:06.718,"Okay, I'm an art student."
00:07:06.801,00:07:08.636,All my adventures are supposed to be two-dimensional.
00:07:08.720,00:07:11.013,-Who says? -Me.
00:07:17.186,00:07:20.397,-I don't know what I'm doing. -Don't sell yourself short.
00:07:20.482,00:07:23.943,"You forget, I've seen you in action, Clary Fairchild."
00:07:24.026,00:07:26.112,"Jocelyn! No, don't... don't..."
00:07:28.781,00:07:29.824,Let me take your pain away.
00:07:31.408,00:07:33.119,Agitation only makes the venom work faster.
00:07:33.202,00:07:34.411,I need to tell Clary.
00:07:35.580,00:07:37.749,"No, you need to know. No, please."
00:07:37.832,00:07:39.250,"Magnus, do it."
00:07:55.057,00:07:56.934,Your suitors need to hurry.
00:08:02.439,00:08:04.484,"Well, learning it would mean I care, so, no."
00:08:04.567,00:08:06.486,"Yeah, and God forbid you care about anyone but yourself."
00:08:06.569,00:08:09.030,I care about a bunch of people. Just don't care about you.
00:08:09.113,00:08:11.407,"Me, or what... What's it called, your... your parabatais?"
00:08:11.491,00:08:13.785,"Whoa, watch your mouth."
00:08:14.786,00:08:16.579,You don't know a thing about me and Alec.
00:08:16.663,00:08:17.997,We clear?
00:08:18.080,00:08:20.416,Twenty bucks says he leaves you hanging tonight.
00:08:20.500,00:08:22.293,-Not a chance. -Really?
00:08:22.376,00:08:25.254,"Come, fetch, roll over. You know, Lie down."
00:08:25.337,00:08:26.756,You treat him like a lap dog.
00:08:26.839,00:08:28.299,Guess it takes one to know one.
00:08:29.551,00:08:31.427,What's that supposed to mean?
00:08:31.511,00:08:35.264,"It means, you're like a yippy dog nipping at Clary's heels."
00:08:35.347,00:08:37.349,I don't nip. And she's my best friend.
00:08:37.433,00:08:38.851,That's all she's ever gonna be.
00:08:40.436,00:08:42.146,Have you seriously not figured that out yet?
00:08:42.229,00:08:45.775,"Look, I don't want Clary as anything more than a best friend."
00:08:45.858,00:08:50.697,-Right. -And I'll have you know that there are tons of women who have more-than-a-friend feelings for me.
00:08:53.616,00:08:54.826,Where are they?
00:08:54.909,00:08:56.536,I don't have to introduce you to them.
00:08:56.619,00:08:59.371,"And my point is, Clary and I have always had each other's backs."
00:09:00.623,00:09:02.083,We had our entire lives.
00:09:02.166,00:09:04.001,That's more than I can say for you or Alec.
00:09:04.085,00:09:07.213,"You do not get to talk about Alec, mundane."
00:09:08.631,00:09:10.633,"I told you, don't call me mundane!"
00:09:10.717,00:09:12.468,Are we clear?
00:09:17.139,00:09:18.224,You gonna cut me?
00:09:26.983,00:09:28.610,I don't know why I did that.
00:09:29.443,00:09:30.737,I'm sorry.
00:09:32.780,00:09:34.323,What happened to you at the vampire hotel?
00:09:34.406,00:09:36.158,"Nothing. I told you, I was a hostage."
00:09:36.242,00:09:38.703,-You sure? -Leave me alone!
00:09:39.621,00:09:42.707,"I told you, it's nothing, it's... You just piss me off."
00:09:50.798,00:09:51.841,Mother.
00:09:54.510,00:09:56.095,What's wrong?
00:09:56.178,00:09:57.429,Nothing.
00:10:01.058,00:10:02.518,Did something happen in Idris?
00:10:02.602,00:10:04.228,Nothing we can do about it now.
00:10:05.146,00:10:06.773,There's always something we can do.
00:10:06.856,00:10:08.357,You taught me that.
00:10:14.822,00:10:16.032,Do you remember when I was ten?
00:10:16.115,00:10:19.952,"And there was that kid, Preston, who kept beating the crap out of me in kendo training?"
00:10:20.036,00:10:22.496,"You had perfect form, perfect technique."
00:10:22.579,00:10:24.415,That was what was holding me back.
00:10:25.124,00:10:29.420,"You said I needed to mess it up, break form, do something he wouldn't expect."
00:10:30.337,00:10:33.257,It went against every fiber of my training...
00:10:33.340,00:10:34.425,but I adapted.
00:10:34.508,00:10:37.386,I was so proud when you broke his nose.
00:10:39.346,00:10:43.726,"Until his mother yelled at you, and insisted I be punished for insubordination."
00:10:44.518,00:10:46.562,That just made me prouder.
00:10:46.646,00:10:48.064,The way you took it.
00:10:48.147,00:10:49.691,I knew it had to be done.
00:10:50.900,00:10:54.111,We can figure out a work-around for whatever the Clave is throwing at you.
00:10:55.529,00:10:58.157,"Work-arounds can get messy, if you recall."
00:11:02.870,00:11:03.955,We're Lightwoods.
00:11:04.038,00:11:07.166,We break noses and accept the consequences.
00:11:09.626,00:11:11.378,Tell me what you need me to do.
00:11:15.800,00:11:17.051,Tell me what?
00:11:17.969,00:11:20.221,What's so important that Luke risked his life?
00:11:20.304,00:11:22.724,Everything Jocelyn hoped to hide from you.
00:11:27.186,00:11:28.187,Why?
00:11:34.526,00:11:35.569,It was your bliss.
00:11:37.864,00:11:39.531,You're gonna need some bliss now.
00:11:39.615,00:11:41.575,"Back then, there wasn't a day I didn't draw."
00:11:41.658,00:11:44.328,It was like breathing.
00:11:44.411,00:11:47.498,"Now, I look at this blank page and I barely even know what to do."
00:11:51.002,00:11:55.006,"Sometimes I feel like my art, my memories..."
00:11:56.007,00:11:57.383,"My life, it..."
00:11:57.466,00:11:59.551,it all vanished with that Memory Demon.
00:12:00.469,00:12:03.180,"Your art, everything you are..."
00:12:04.306,00:12:05.808,they're all still here.
00:12:07.268,00:12:09.728,You're the woman your mother always knew you could be.
00:12:10.687,00:12:13.565,But tried to keep me from being.
00:12:13.649,00:12:15.692,That's why you need to know how you got here.
00:12:21.198,00:12:24.368,That's the only reason I can think of why Luke would be so adamant.
00:12:26.453,00:12:27.746,I'm ready.
00:12:29.040,00:12:30.582,"Bring it, warlock."
00:12:34.045,00:12:43.679,"around the time he and Jocelyn first got together, long before the Uprising and the Circle, Valentine elevated the Morgenstern name to be synonymous with virtue."
00:12:43.762,00:12:46.140,"Defenders of the Accords, allies to the Downworld."
00:12:46.223,00:12:47.683,This is who we are!
00:12:49.435,00:12:51.478,We must never violate our oath.
00:12:51.562,00:12:54.231,Because this is our sacred duty.
00:12:58.820,00:13:00.404,barely two years later...
00:13:01.030,00:13:03.240,his name had become synonymous with devastation.
00:13:04.867,00:13:07.078,Your mother told me it was then she first saw the signs.
00:13:08.287,00:13:09.621,Val...
00:13:10.747,00:13:12.249,Are you hurt?
00:13:12.749,00:13:14.418,Talk to me. Whose blood is this?
00:13:14.501,00:13:15.669,Warlocks.
00:13:15.752,00:13:17.546,They attacked you? Where? When?
00:13:19.715,00:13:21.050,You've broken the Accords.
00:13:24.846,00:13:27.306,I'll talk to my father. He knows the Law better than anyone.
00:13:27.389,00:13:29.266,Sometimes it isn't clear who instigated the fight.
00:13:29.350,00:13:30.935,The Accords are a fallacy.
00:13:31.018,00:13:35.606,"Everything about them, down to the blasphemous magic that binds us all to their stupidity."
00:13:35.689,00:13:37.274,The Accords guarantee peace.
00:13:37.358,00:13:39.944,We are Shadowhunters. We don't make peace with demons.
00:13:40.027,00:13:41.863,Downworlders are half human.
00:13:41.946,00:13:44.198,And half demon! Shadowhunters kill demons.
00:13:45.116,00:13:46.492,I'm fulfilling our destiny.
00:13:50.454,00:13:52.706,We'd all stood with the Clave for centuries.
00:13:52.789,00:13:54.625,How could that not matter to him?
00:13:54.708,00:13:57.378,He was obsessed with ensuring purity of blood.
00:13:58.295,00:14:00.672,Convinced that the impurities were a threat to peace.
00:14:00.756,00:14:02.299,He was the threat to peace.
00:14:02.383,00:14:04.135,Mad men rarely make sense.
00:14:05.052,00:14:10.307,"Mostly, they just hate. And he hated the Downworlders, for the gifts that we possess that he could not have."
00:14:11.850,00:14:13.685,He hated us enough to kill us all.
00:14:19.650,00:14:21.903,It has to be Alec. He'll adapt.
00:14:22.444,00:14:23.487,Adapt to what?
00:14:23.570,00:14:25.031,It's not your concern.
00:14:25.114,00:14:27.283,"Maryse, this is a family decision."
00:14:27.366,00:14:30.494,"This is our only option. Get on board, Robert!"
00:14:31.328,00:14:33.039,She's been like that all day.
00:14:41.422,00:14:44.175,"You know, ever since you were little, this has been my favorite part of coming home."
00:14:44.258,00:14:45.342,Why?
00:14:51.765,00:14:53.893,You trying to tell me something?
00:14:53.976,00:14:55.311,"No, not at all."
00:15:01.275,00:15:02.609,I love it.
00:15:04.528,00:15:06.655,But I'm still gonna ask you what that was about.
00:15:08.032,00:15:12.036,"If the Seelies change sides, we have no hope of defeating Valentine."
00:15:12.119,00:15:13.704,There has to be something we can do.
00:15:16.790,00:15:18.875,I'm not judging you.
00:15:18.960,00:15:21.587,It's a fact. It's an asset.
00:15:21.670,00:15:24.715,You and I need to convince the Clave of what's coming.
00:15:25.967,00:15:27.009,But...
00:15:28.427,00:15:31.638,after all the unsanctioned missions that your brother authorized while we were away...
00:15:31.722,00:15:33.307,Alec was protecting Clary.
00:15:33.390,00:15:35.642,We all were. That's what the Clave wanted.
00:15:36.227,00:15:37.353,You went rogue.
00:15:38.312,00:15:41.148,And now the Clave thinks our family honor is beyond repair.
00:15:41.232,00:15:47.196,"The Lightwood name only has meaning because of all the people who have fought for our cause, we were among the bravest."
00:15:47.279,00:15:49.156,The best of the Shadowhunters.
00:15:49.240,00:15:51.200,And now they think we're not anymore.
00:15:54.786,00:15:55.871,We'll do better.
00:15:55.955,00:15:59.083,"Jace, Alec, and I, we'll restore the family name and our honor."
00:15:59.166,00:16:02.669,Then you need to understand the honor comes from the deed.
00:16:02.753,00:16:05.256,It's not a simple proposition to restore it.
00:16:05.339,00:16:08.092,It's gonna require a tremendous sacrifice.
00:16:12.221,00:16:19.979,"Ever since my mother was kidnapped, and the Shadow World invaded my life, so many Downworlders have helped me, not even thinking about what it might cost them."
00:16:20.062,00:16:21.897,How could Valentine not see good in any of them?
00:16:21.981,00:16:23.983,He was blinded by his ambition.
00:16:24.566,00:16:26.193,Why didn't the Clave stop him?
00:16:28.195,00:16:35.702,"He and his followers, they managed to convince the Clave that the Downworlders they killed on their special missions had violated the Accords in some way."
00:16:35.786,00:16:37.704,Complete fabrications.
00:16:37.788,00:16:39.123,How could the Clave not see?
00:16:41.375,00:16:43.835,Shadowhunters believe in the Law as absolute.
00:16:43.919,00:16:46.588,They could never conceive of one of their own going astray.
00:16:47.798,00:16:49.758,"My father didn't go astray, Magnus."
00:16:49.841,00:16:51.468,He went insane.
00:16:52.011,00:16:55.222,What happened back then is happening again.
00:16:55.306,00:16:57.808,The Clave refuses to believe that Valentine's a threat.
00:16:58.975,00:17:04.523,"Nineteen years ago, their lack of vision allowed the Circle to almost decimate the entire Shadow World."
00:17:05.607,00:17:07.109,-That was the Uprising? -Yes.
00:17:07.193,00:17:10.737,Valentine wanted to create a new Shadowhunter army.
00:17:12.323,00:17:15.409,"And for that, he needed the Mortal Cup."
00:17:15.492,00:17:20.331,He knew it would be on display at the signing of the Accords as a show of the Clave's power.
00:17:50.026,00:17:54.948,"Destroy the Accords, murder Downworlders, and secure the Cup."
00:18:19.265,00:18:22.559,How could my mom and Luke be a part of something like this?
00:18:22.643,00:18:25.312,Jocelyn and Luke tried to prevent the Uprising.
00:18:25.396,00:18:27.648,They tried to change Valentine's mind about Downworlders.
00:18:27.731,00:18:29.983,"Obviously, they didn't."
00:18:30.066,00:18:33.862,"Clary, if it wasn't for your mother and Luke, the Circle would have won."
00:19:50.606,00:19:56.570,"Ever since I found out Valentine was my father, I wondered how my mother could be married to someone like that..."
00:19:56.653,00:19:58.197,and why she stayed.
00:19:59.198,00:20:00.282,She had to stop him.
00:20:00.366,00:20:02.243,And safeguard the Cup.
00:20:02.826,00:20:06.162,"Everything Jocelyn did, she did to save the people she'd sworn to protect."
00:20:06.247,00:20:08.624,She took her oath as a Shadowhunter seriously.
00:20:08.707,00:20:11.252,"I understand, but how does that help me find the Cup?"
00:20:11.335,00:20:15.881,"Maybe Luke thinks if you know your mother better, you'll know where she hid it."
00:20:15.964,00:20:18.091,"Then, tell me why she gave up being a Shadowhunter."
00:20:18.967,00:20:21.762,Because the one thing in the world she loved more is you.
00:20:22.804,00:20:24.390,She had to protect you.
00:20:33.189,00:20:35.066,-Luke? -The magic's wearing off.
00:20:35.609,00:20:37.778,It was our fault. It was our fault!
00:20:50.332,00:20:53.502,Promise me you won't go through with it. Promise me you'll say no.
00:20:53.585,00:20:55.086,What are you talking about? Say no to what?
00:20:55.170,00:20:56.713,They're gonna make you marry.
00:20:58.757,00:21:01.260,Our parents are making plans for both of us.
00:21:01.343,00:21:03.262,"No, you heard wrong."
00:21:04.888,00:21:06.222,"It's true, Alec."
00:21:06.307,00:21:09.976,They need a political alliance quickly to restore our family name and our influence at the Clave.
00:21:12.145,00:21:14.481,I knew Clary Fray would come back to bite me in the ass.
00:21:18.444,00:21:21.237,They need me to convince the Clave to placate the Seelies somehow.
00:21:22.155,00:21:24.616,You're playing the diplomat? Again?
00:21:24.700,00:21:26.577,That's my job. That's what I'm supposed to be doing!
00:21:26.660,00:21:29.371,I know that. But I'm the one with ties to the Seelies.
00:21:31.707,00:21:33.334,Is that what you're calling it now?
00:21:33.417,00:21:34.918,"Alec, I'm on your side."
00:21:36.044,00:21:37.128,Really?
00:21:38.213,00:21:40.507,I have followed every rule.
00:21:41.300,00:21:42.593,I've given up everything!
00:21:42.676,00:21:43.927,We'll find a way out of this.
00:21:53.228,00:21:55.606,Screw them. Screw all of this.
00:21:57.899,00:21:59.025,Alec.
00:22:03.697,00:22:08.410,So is this where you kill me and dispose of the body in some ditch -where no one will find me? -Tell me again.
00:22:08.494,00:22:10.829,-What does Clary see in you? -My inner compassion.
00:22:10.912,00:22:12.539,Something you're sorely lacking.
00:22:12.623,00:22:15.792,You don't really need compassion when you can get by on charm and good looks.
00:22:15.876,00:22:17.503,And you wonder what she sees in me.
00:22:21.047,00:22:22.257,What are we doing here?
00:22:22.799,00:22:25.218,My black market dealer operates out of this building.
00:22:25.301,00:22:27.262,"Cozy. Downworlder, I'm assuming?"
00:22:28.096,00:22:29.180,Hates mundanes.
00:22:29.264,00:22:31.016,So you guys have something in common.
00:22:31.099,00:22:33.519,"Just, uh... hang back."
00:22:35.186,00:22:37.147,I told Clary I'd get her what she needs to save Luke.
00:22:37.230,00:22:40.066,I am not hanging back like some third wheel.
00:22:40.150,00:22:41.777,You are a third wheel.
00:22:44.863,00:22:46.114,And I wasn't asking.
00:22:55.290,00:22:56.625,Camille?
00:23:13.016,00:23:16.311,"Come on, mundane. Clary will not be happy if I let you die."
00:23:27.656,00:23:31.367,"I can't leave him, but the potion stock still needs Komodo scale."
00:23:31.452,00:23:33.454,"Find it, add the rest when they get here."
00:23:33.537,00:23:35.872,-You'll have to feed it to Luke. -What about you?
00:23:35.956,00:23:37.666,I'll hold on as long as I can.
00:23:52.931,00:23:54.516,I need your strength.
00:23:57.853,00:23:59.020,Take what you need.
00:24:53.992,00:24:55.076,Yeah.
00:24:56.077,00:24:59.164,"It's just like your father, trying to undermine me through you."
00:24:59.247,00:25:01.875,What's going on between you and Dad? You think I can't pick up on it?
00:25:01.958,00:25:03.418,Keep your voice down!
00:25:03.501,00:25:05.962,This is not about me and your father. It's about Alec.
00:25:06.046,00:25:07.631,And I'll do anything to protect him.
00:25:08.381,00:25:10.050,"Well, you can't do this."
00:25:10.133,00:25:12.218,You and your Downworlders have seen to that.
00:25:12.803,00:25:17.515,You can't possibly attract the caliber of husband who could help us restore the honor to our family name.
00:25:17.599,00:25:19.017,The honor comes from the deed.
00:25:19.100,00:25:22.103,"When you truly understand that, then you'll understand me."
00:25:25.481,00:25:27.568,"It's all the same to a Shadowhunter, Isabelle."
00:25:27.651,00:25:30.737,How can we protect others when we can't protect our own family?
00:25:30.821,00:25:33.198,Alec gets that...
00:25:33.281,00:25:34.282,unlike you.
00:25:54.803,00:25:55.887,"Alec, wait."
00:25:58.765,00:26:00.516,"If you hadn't gotten here in time, I..."
00:26:03.186,00:26:06.147,I'm just... I'm glad you and Jace are okay now.
00:26:06.982,00:26:08.817,I didn't do this for Jace.
00:26:10.861,00:26:12.613,Then I'm glad you did it for you.
00:26:28.837,00:26:31.923,"You have an interesting effect on people, Clary Fray."
00:26:32.007,00:26:33.549,He helped save Luke's life.
00:26:34.134,00:26:35.551,You all did.
00:26:35.636,00:26:36.970,Thank you.
00:26:37.595,00:26:39.014,For what? For running an errand?
00:26:39.097,00:26:41.141,For having my back.
00:26:44.519,00:26:46.562,I'm always gonna have your back.
00:26:53.820,00:26:54.905,Clary...
00:26:57.658,00:26:58.742,Luke's asking for you.
00:27:04.205,00:27:05.874,Thank you... so much.
00:27:14.632,00:27:16.718,Tell Clary I've got something to do.
00:27:17.635,00:27:18.679,Simon.
00:27:39.157,00:27:40.575,Speed.
00:27:42.535,00:27:43.661,Courage in Combat.
00:27:45.496,00:27:46.998,Nourishment.
00:27:50.501,00:27:51.920,"Oh, right."
00:27:58.802,00:28:00.595,"Max, could we have a moment?"
00:28:00.678,00:28:02.973,I never get to hear the good stuff.
00:28:09.645,00:28:11.564,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be so harsh."
00:28:12.899,00:28:13.942,I'm used to it by now.
00:28:14.025,00:28:17.445,I wish you could understand how difficult it is to be your own childrens' commander.
00:28:17.528,00:28:19.781,You've made your priorities pretty clear.
00:28:19.865,00:28:22.200,"-In times of war-- -We're always at war, Mom."
00:28:23.701,00:28:25.703,So spare me your parenting excuses.
00:28:25.787,00:28:29.582,"Isabelle, I'm trying to protect all of us. I'm trying to protect you."
00:28:29.665,00:28:32.794,And how exactly does what you're doing to Alec protect me?
00:28:37.715,00:28:40.093,"If that were true, I would actually be impressed."
00:28:40.176,00:28:41.261,"Trust me, you wouldn't."
00:28:41.344,00:28:43.388,"When I was your age, I thought I had everything figured out."
00:28:43.471,00:28:46.349,I thought I could change the world by breaking the rules.
00:28:51.062,00:28:54.190,She was stupid. She confused passion with strength.
00:28:54.274,00:28:56.151,-So passion makes you weak? -No.
00:28:56.234,00:28:59.362,Passion makes you dangerous.
00:28:59.445,00:29:02.240,That's why you're not ready for the responsibility you think you are.
00:29:16.212,00:29:17.422,You're welcome.
00:29:21.885,00:29:23.678,I'll leave you two alone.
00:29:30.226,00:29:31.770,Go easy on him.
00:29:37.442,00:29:39.444,"You know you can't avoid the question, right?"
00:29:41.404,00:29:44.950,"I know Mom swore you to secrecy, but I've seen you stand up to her before."
00:29:45.033,00:29:46.785,Why didn't you tell me about any of this?
00:29:46.868,00:29:48.453,Because I was afraid you'd hate us.
00:29:48.536,00:29:49.704,Not possible.
00:29:50.997,00:29:55.418,"Okay... the last few days, I have not had all of the information."
00:29:55.501,00:29:58.338,And you still don't. But you need to know everything.
00:29:58.421,00:30:00.715,It'll help you find the Mortal Cup.
00:30:00.799,00:30:03.218,-How? -You're just gonna have to trust me.
00:30:03.844,00:30:06.054,"I do, more than anything."
00:30:07.889,00:30:10.350,Nothing you say is ever gonna change that.
00:30:10.433,00:30:12.560,"Okay, but you have to trust me, too."
00:30:14.020,00:30:15.188,All right.
00:30:18.191,00:30:21.444,-Magnus told you about the Uprising? -Yeah.
00:30:21.527,00:30:23.822,About the Valentine who murdered all those people?
00:30:24.865,00:30:25.991,Yes.
00:30:26.074,00:30:29.494,The reason he became that man was our fault...
00:30:31.412,00:30:32.914,mine and Jocelyn's.
00:30:34.290,00:30:37.002,"-I don't believe you. -We betrayed him, Clary..."
00:30:37.085,00:30:38.253,your mother and I.
00:30:41.797,00:30:43.091,We fell in love.
00:30:46.302,00:30:47.387,Did you...
00:30:52.267,00:30:54.269,-Are you my... -No.
00:30:54.352,00:30:55.645,"No, we never..."
00:30:55.728,00:30:58.481,"-Slept together? -Yeah. I mean, no!"
00:31:00.691,00:31:02.402,Valentine was my parabatai.
00:31:03.319,00:31:04.988,We both loved him.
00:31:05.696,00:31:07.573,But as his rhetoric got more violent...
00:31:11.036,00:31:12.370,we started to worry.
00:31:13.121,00:31:16.666,"We tried to help him, tried to temper him, but..."
00:31:16.749,00:31:18.543,he just kept pulling away.
00:31:20.628,00:31:22.422,That just drew us closer together.
00:31:23.339,00:31:27.343,"We knew it was wrong, but we couldn't deny it, or hide it."
00:31:35.060,00:31:37.228,We have to make Val listen to reason.
00:31:45.028,00:31:47.697,He was obsessed with winning Jocelyn's heart back.
00:31:50.450,00:31:53.578,"For love, he was willing to do anything..."
00:31:53.661,00:31:56.206,even compromise his own principles.
00:31:56.289,00:31:59.000,He became fixated on becoming a better soldier.
00:31:59.918,00:32:01.794,That led him to do the unthinkable...
00:32:01.877,00:32:04.380,experiment with Downworlder blood.
00:32:14.099,00:32:16.267,Val! Hey! Hey!
00:32:16.351,00:32:18.019,"Val, come on."
00:32:21.064,00:32:22.732,we never got him back again.
00:32:28.488,00:32:29.948,than anything anybody else could have done.
00:32:33.784,00:32:35.245,At least now I know he had one...
00:32:35.954,00:32:39.040,"before his crazy, distorted world view set in."
00:32:49.800,00:32:52.595,Sometimes you have to take matters into your own hands.
00:32:56.807,00:32:58.643,"Before he, you know..."
00:32:58.726,00:33:00.311,In the early days of the Circle?
00:33:02.022,00:33:05.108,Oh... he was honorable.
00:33:05.191,00:33:06.567,Idealistic.
00:33:07.568,00:33:09.570,He was charismatic.
00:33:10.571,00:33:13.866,Just Mom's type. Just like you.
00:33:13.949,00:33:15.451,"Oh, no. No."
00:33:15.535,00:33:18.038,I never came close. He was a leader.
00:33:19.539,00:33:21.957,Devoted to protecting us from dying pointless deaths.
00:33:22.042,00:33:24.044,And you believed in him.
00:33:24.127,00:33:27.797,"If Simon told you he had the cure for cancer, you'd want to believe him, too."
00:33:27.880,00:33:30.216,"Well, I'd probably give him the benefit of the doubt at least."
00:33:30.300,00:33:33.386,Which is what I did. What we all did.
00:33:33.469,00:33:34.512,The demons were winning.
00:33:34.595,00:33:37.598,We couldn't train our people fast enough to keep up.
00:33:37.682,00:33:42.062,"Val wanted the Clave to use the Mortal Cup to create more Shadowhunters, but that just made them angry."
00:33:42.145,00:33:44.397,Isn't more Shadowhunters a good thing?
00:33:44.480,00:33:45.773,Not the way he was proposing.
00:33:45.856,00:33:53.239,"Ever since the Angel Raziel created the first Shadowhunters with the Cup, it's been forbidden to use the Cup again to rebuild their forces."
00:33:55.991,00:34:00.163,"Jocelyn and I, we tried pulling him back, but he just misconstrued that as..."
00:34:02.957,00:34:04.584,"It's not your fault, Luke."
00:34:04.667,00:34:07.337,There's no way you two could have pushed him over the edge.
00:34:08.379,00:34:09.755,He did that to himself...
00:34:09.839,00:34:11.549,with the blood injections.
00:34:11.632,00:34:15.761,"And the more injections he took, the deeper it seemed he descended into madness."
00:34:16.471,00:34:22.143,"-Val-- -Those things continue to multiply, while we sacrifice ourselves to protect the mundanes."
00:34:22.227,00:34:25.105,"The Clave is content to operate with blinders on, but I'm not!"
00:34:25.188,00:34:26.981,I'm the only one who sees the truth!
00:34:28.316,00:34:30.568,-Magnus never told me that part. -He didn't know.
00:34:30.651,00:34:32.653,There are some things Joce and I never talked about.
00:34:32.737,00:34:34.572,Why would she hide that she's an artist...
00:34:34.655,00:34:36.031,especially from me?
00:34:36.116,00:34:38.868,"Because after that night, she locked that part of herself away."
00:34:38.951,00:34:41.371,She never wanted their lives to affect you.
00:34:41.454,00:34:43.331,What did my father do?
00:34:48.128,00:34:50.755,Your mother is the only other person I ever told this to.
00:34:50.838,00:34:52.715,I never wanted it to burden you.
00:34:52.798,00:34:53.883,Tell me.
00:34:55.301,00:34:57.512,Valentine asked me to back him up on a mission.
00:34:59.972,00:35:01.849,Some farmers had gone missing.
00:35:02.933,00:35:04.269,He said it was werewolves.
00:35:26.249,00:35:28.459,And then he betrayed everything else he believed in.
00:35:32.588,00:35:34.299,Why aren't you dead?
00:35:34.382,00:35:35.633,Because I'm a Shadowhunter.
00:35:55.486,00:35:56.696,You should have killed yourself.
00:36:25.683,00:36:28.561,"For a while, I thought he'd killed her."
00:36:30.020,00:36:31.689,He wanted us both dead.
00:36:31.772,00:36:33.566,He killed thousands.
00:36:33.649,00:36:36.277,Turned Shadowhunter against Shadowhunter.
00:36:37.278,00:36:38.821,Do you understand what I'm saying?
00:36:38.904,00:36:41.115,God only knows what he'd do if he got the Cup.
00:36:48.998,00:36:51.417,We have to get the Cup before Valentine does.
00:36:54.587,00:36:57.172,It all starts and ends with you.
00:36:57.257,00:36:58.383,How do you know that?
00:36:58.466,00:36:59.759,Because I know Jocelyn.
00:37:01.135,00:37:04.597,You're the only other person she would have trusted with the location of the Cup.
00:37:04.680,00:37:07.558,"If she trusted me so much, why didn't she tell me any of this?"
00:37:07.642,00:37:09.352,She didn't think this was gonna happen.
00:37:12.772,00:37:15.650,Jocelyn said that I should tell you everything about our past.
00:37:15.733,00:37:17.693,-That it would unlock you. -What does that even mean?
00:37:17.777,00:37:20.195,I don't know! But you do.
00:37:20.280,00:37:22.782,"-Memory's wiped, remember? -There are clues."
00:37:22.865,00:37:25.868,"They're inside the mundane world. Think, Clary."
00:38:05.616,00:38:07.327,"You know I have magic for that, right?"
00:38:08.328,00:38:10.788,I think you've exerted yourself enough for one day.
00:38:10.871,00:38:12.081,Drink break?
00:38:24.885,00:38:26.053,To us.
00:38:34.395,00:38:38.566,Why did you ask for me... when Jace and Clary were both here?
00:38:38.649,00:38:40.693,"Hmm, Jace didn't tell you?"
00:38:42.987,00:38:45.448,It doesn't matter. It was a lie anyway.
00:38:47.157,00:38:48.784,Are warlocks always this cryptic?
00:38:52.330,00:38:53.831,I'm being coy.
00:39:02.340,00:39:03.674,I wanted to see you again.
00:39:08.679,00:39:09.764,Why?
00:39:09.847,00:39:11.891,Why'd you come?
00:39:16.270,00:39:17.397,I'm not sure.
00:39:21.066,00:39:23.193,For almost a century...
00:39:23.277,00:39:26.155,I've closed myself off to feeling anything for anyone.
00:39:26.864,00:39:28.323,Man or woman.
00:39:30.910,00:39:32.995,You've unlocked something in me.
00:39:46.634,00:39:48.177,"Hey. Hi, Mother."
00:39:55.184,00:39:56.644,Of course.
00:39:58.896,00:40:01.190,-Duty calls. -Ah...
00:40:01.273,00:40:04.109,"Oh, the furrowed brow."
00:40:09.239,00:40:10.991,"Oh, listen, Magnus, I..."
00:40:15.496,00:40:16.956,I understand.
00:40:20.668,00:40:22.002,Stay for just one more drink?
00:40:23.337,00:40:24.797,And then decide.
00:40:27.007,00:40:28.759,I don't remember anything.
00:40:31.846,00:40:35.224,-You have to figure this out! -You said you had to tell me everything.
00:40:38.769,00:40:40.354,Wait.
00:40:46.861,00:40:48.488,-What is this? -No.
00:40:48.571,00:40:50.239,-Mom said this belonged to my father... -No.
00:40:50.322,00:40:52.032,...but Valentine is my father.
00:40:52.825,00:40:54.326,Who is JC?
00:40:54.409,00:40:56.829,I want you to remember your father could be a good man.
00:40:56.912,00:40:59.707,"After what he did to you-- This is worse, Clary."
00:40:59.790,00:41:00.833,I don't care!
00:41:01.333,00:41:03.335,"Luke, I want to know, I..."
00:41:03.418,00:41:04.795,I need to know.
00:41:06.547,00:41:08.924,You said so yourself.
00:41:09.008,00:41:10.384,You have to tell me everything.
00:41:10.468,00:41:12.845,JC stands for Jonathan Christopher...
00:41:15.681,00:41:16.849,your brother.
00:41:20.019,00:41:21.061,I have a brother?
00:41:22.021,00:41:23.063,You did.
00:41:24.815,00:41:26.984,He died in a fire at Fairchild Manor.
00:41:28.402,00:41:30.404,A fire that your father set.
00:41:35.284,00:41:36.285,That's it.
00:41:39.955,00:41:41.791,"that my mother needed me to hear, but..."
00:41:44.209,00:41:45.878,Is that what she meant to unlock?
00:41:47.087,00:41:48.798,How did I do that?
00:41:48.881,00:41:54.303,"There are Shadowhunters that have unusual Angelic Powers, but I've never seen anyone do what you just did."
00:42:01.143,00:42:03.478,Can these powers be inherited?
00:42:04.564,00:42:05.565,I think so.
00:42:09.443,00:42:11.236,I know where my mother hid the Cup.
00:00:11.844,00:00:18.310,"‎-Was he bitten by an alpha?‎ ‎-Yeah.‎ ‎-Have you spoken to Jace yet?‎ ‎-He can call me‎ ‎when he's done chasing the little girl.‎ ‎Stir.‎ ‎We can't have that girl‎ ‎out of Institute control.‎ ‎The entire Shadow World‎ ‎is looking for her.‎ ‎You do not get to talk about Alec,‎ ‎mundane.‎ ‎I've closed myself off to feeling‎ ‎anything for anyone.‎ ‎You've unlocked something in me.‎ ‎I'm always gonna have your back.‎ ‎I know where my mother hid the Cup.‎ ‎I know where the Cup is.‎ ‎My mom, she must have‎ ‎painted them years ago,‎ ‎but the Mortal Cup has to be hidden‎ ‎inside the Ace of Cups.‎ ‎The card looks exactly like it.‎ ‎Wait, why aren't you guys‎ ‎happy about this?‎ ‎All we have to do is find...‎ ‎Dot.‎ ‎If Dot had the cards when she was taken,‎ ‎we don't have much time.‎ ‎-If Valentine gets his hands on the Cup--‎ ‎-We know.‎ ‎If Valentine started‎ ‎creating Shadowhunters‎ ‎or gained control of demons,‎ ‎it'd be like Beyoncé riding on a dinosaur‎ ‎through Times Square.‎ ‎People would notice.‎ ‎But he can control demons.‎ ‎I've seen it.‎ ‎Mmm, paying off a few demons is easy,‎ ‎especially since they rarely‎ ‎survive long enough to collect.‎ ‎Still waiting‎ ‎on Valentine's thank-you card.‎ ‎Opening the gates of hell...‎ ‎that's a little more tricky.‎ ‎Valentine doesn't have the cards.‎ ‎I do.‎ ‎They're in my desk back at the precinct.‎ ‎When Clary went missing,‎ ‎I went to the loft‎ ‎and I cleared everything out,‎ ‎'cause I didn't want‎ ‎the Circle to track her.‎ ‎That's great.‎ ‎This should be easy.‎ ‎Mmm, that's what General Custer said.‎ ‎Magnus is right.‎ ‎Valentine has spies everywhere,‎ ‎even in the NYPD.‎ ‎-We have to be discreet.‎ ‎-Discreet?‎ ‎You look like something‎ ‎out of The Mummy movie.‎ ‎Werewolf healing, remember?‎ ‎This is nothing a couple of hours‎ ‎of beauty sleep can't fix.‎ ‎Hi.‎ ‎Okay, who are you‎ ‎and what did you do with Simon?‎ ‎I'm serious.‎ ‎I've never seen this side of you before.‎ ‎First, you're acting really weird,‎ ‎you're disappearing for days on end.‎ ‎Now, this.‎ ‎I mean, I've always thought‎ ‎you were cute,‎ ‎but last night you were...‎ ‎You were amazing.‎ ‎Like, Fifty Shades of amazing?‎ ‎Like, Pon farr amazing.‎ ‎I love it when you speak Vulcan.‎ ‎-Holy crap.‎ ‎-Simon...‎ ‎can I ask you something?‎ ‎Uh... sure.‎ ‎About us.‎ ‎You and me... us.‎ ‎You seriously have no idea‎ ‎where I'm going with this.‎ ‎Honestly, I'm...‎ ‎I'm a little confused right now.‎ ‎But, um... in a good way.‎ ‎Simon...‎ ‎when are you gonna ask me‎ ‎to be your girlfriend?‎ ‎Uh...‎ ‎Um...‎ ‎Uh, yeah, just, uh...‎ ‎I... I forgot something.‎ ‎I forgot, I...‎ ‎Was it my name?‎ ‎Because it's Maureen.‎ ‎No. No. It's, uh...‎ ‎I... I forgot to turn the oven off‎ ‎at my mom's.‎ ‎Simon, you don't even cook.‎ ‎Right, which is exactly‎ ‎why I probably left it on.‎ ‎So I should... I should fix that, right?‎ ‎I'm not interested in just hooking up.‎ ‎-Maureen--‎ ‎-So if you're still stuck on Clary, then--‎ ‎Clary's seeing someone else.‎ ‎I promise.‎ ‎Okay? It's just that I've...‎ ‎All right, cards are on my desk.‎ ‎It shouldn't take long.‎ ‎-All right.‎ ‎-Whoa, whoa, whoa.‎ ‎It'll be easier to avoid unnecessary‎ ‎attention if I do this alone.‎ ‎We'll wait here.‎ ‎It sounded boring anyway.‎ ‎Hey.‎ ‎Stop right where you are.‎ ‎Don't touch anything.‎ ‎Detective Garroway,‎ ‎I need your badge and your gun.‎ ‎Who's this?‎ ‎His name is Fisk.‎ ‎Internal affairs.‎ ‎My hands are tied.‎ ‎You're gonna have to cooperate.‎ ‎Have ballistics run it through the system,‎ ‎see what pops up.‎ ‎You're coming with me.‎ ‎Let's go.‎ ‎I've got a bad feeling about this.‎ ‎What is taking him so long?‎ ‎I know a way we could find out.‎ ‎Just go in and see for ourselves.‎ ‎Luke told us to stay put,‎ ‎so that's what we're gonna do.‎ ‎That's probably him now.‎ ‎I doubt it.‎ ‎Just so I'm clear, he did mention‎ ‎something about trying‎ ‎to avoid attention, right?‎ ‎From the looks of it,‎ ‎he's doing a terrible job.‎ ‎Circle members?‎ ‎No, mundanes.‎ ‎Internal affairs officers.‎ ‎You can tell all that‎ ‎just by looking at them?‎ ‎I can tell all that‎ ‎by reading their badges.‎ ‎Better than binoculars.‎ ‎-Luke had his chance.‎ ‎-Yeah.‎ ‎-Let's go.‎ ‎-Okay.‎ ‎Alec?‎ ‎Alec!‎ ‎Is everything okay?‎ ‎Better than ever.‎ ‎Is there something‎ ‎you want to talk about?‎ ‎No. All good.‎ ‎Have you seen Alec?‎ ‎-Um, no. Why?‎ ‎-He's supposed to fill out‎ ‎the incident reports‎ ‎for all the recent demonic activity.‎ ‎I can do it.‎ ‎I know you can, but the Clave--‎ ‎Will be fine getting it from me.‎ ‎Of course they will.‎ ‎I'll let your mother know‎ ‎that you're gonna handle this.‎ ‎I'm sure she'll be very glad to hear it.‎ ‎Thanks.‎ ‎Look familiar?‎ ‎Maybe. I'd have to ask my lawyer.‎ ‎That's the way you want it?‎ ‎One lawyer, coming up.‎ ‎You sit tight.‎ ‎You want a coffee or anything?‎ ‎Garroway.‎ ‎Coffee?‎ ‎No. No, I'm good.‎ ‎Suit yourself.‎ ‎Camera.‎ ‎Luke, what is going on?‎ ‎I think I'm about to be the prime suspect‎ ‎in a murder investigation.‎ ‎In my desk, bottom drawer.‎ ‎-All right.‎ ‎-Whoa, whoa, whoa.‎ ‎You can't glamour yourselves.‎ ‎I'm not the only Downworlder‎ ‎on the force,‎ ‎and we don't know‎ ‎who's working for Valentine.‎ ‎If anybody spots you--‎ ‎We'd be leading them‎ ‎right to the Mortal Cup.‎ ‎Exactly. Better to assume‎ ‎that everybody has the Sight‎ ‎-Luke--‎ ‎-I can handle myself.‎ ‎Hey, what happened to the camera?‎ ‎I've asked the same thing for years.‎ ‎Slept at Magnus' place?‎ ‎Didn't do much sleeping.‎ ‎I was helping treat Luke's wounds.‎ ‎That's all.‎ ‎Really?‎ ‎What?‎ ‎Okay, Magnus made cocktails.‎ ‎I'm telling you, nothing else happened.‎ ‎When you're ready to talk about‎ ‎whatever you need to talk about,‎ ‎I'm here.‎ ‎Hey, I talk to you.‎ ‎About everything‎ ‎but your personal life.‎ ‎You know,‎ ‎and it's kind of not fair,‎ ‎because I talk to you about mine‎ ‎all the time.‎ ‎For example, I broke up with Meliorn.‎ ‎Really?‎ ‎Turning over a new leaf?‎ ‎Apparently, I need someone‎ ‎more Shadowhunter-ish.‎ ‎Izzy, I realize that you're trying‎ ‎to take some of the family heat,‎ ‎and I appreciate it,‎ ‎but you can't change who you are.‎ ‎Really?‎ ‎-And you can?‎ ‎-I know who I am.‎ ‎I'm a guy who's about to be disowned‎ ‎when Dad finds out that Jace and Clary‎ ‎are still out doing God knows what.‎ ‎I think Dad's used to that by now.‎ ‎This is Jace you're talking about.‎ ‎He said he'd be an hour.‎ ‎It's been three.‎ ‎You don't think he and Clary are...‎ ‎At a time like this? Not possible.‎ ‎-The cards?‎ ‎-Right.‎ ‎How exactly are we gonna get them?‎ ‎I doubt we can make it out of this closet‎ ‎without drawing attention,‎ ‎let alone Luke's desk‎ ‎and you are covered in runes.‎ ‎Don't worry.‎ ‎I've got a plan.‎ ‎-A good plan this time?‎ ‎-90%.‎ ‎Just follow my lead.‎ ‎-Oh, and I apologize.‎ ‎-Apologize for what?‎ ‎The other 10%.‎ ‎Oh!‎ ‎Stop following me!‎ ‎-Hmm?‎ ‎-Wait, what did you say?‎ ‎-You cheated on me?‎ ‎-I... Huh?‎ ‎I did not. Whoa.‎ ‎You will never see me‎ ‎at your crappy apartment again.‎ ‎Is that the boyfriend‎ ‎that I heard so much about?‎ ‎I'm dumping him.‎ ‎Where is all of Luke's stuff?‎ ‎IA took everything.‎ ‎What are you looking for?‎ ‎and Luke normally‎ ‎keeps a spare in his desk,‎ ‎so is there any way I can get it?‎ ‎Uh, not till he's cleared.‎ ‎Cleared?‎ ‎Of... of what?‎ ‎Oh, don't worry about it.‎ ‎We'll get it handled.‎ ‎Oh.‎ ‎I apologize. I just want you to know‎ ‎it only happened, like...‎ ‎two or...‎ ‎It just happened a couple of times‎ ‎Babe, come on.‎ ‎Listen, you don't get‎ ‎to call her babe, okay?‎ ‎In fact, you don't get to‎ ‎call her at all.‎ ‎Clary's done with you.‎ ‎You got it?‎ ‎Perhaps it's for the best?‎ ‎Oh, matching tattoos.‎ ‎That's... Big red flag.‎ ‎Don't worry about it. I get it.‎ ‎You always fall for the bad boys, right?‎ ‎Oh, is that just me?‎ ‎I really need that key.‎ ‎I'm sorry, Clary,‎ ‎but IA has all of Luke's things‎ ‎in the evidence vault upstairs.‎ ‎Oh.‎ ‎Maybe I can help you‎ ‎find the one you lost.‎ ‎Did you check your bag?‎ ‎Oh, my God!‎ ‎You're totally right.‎ ‎Thank you so much.‎ ‎Bye.‎ ‎I'm going to lunch.‎ ‎This job is gonna be the death of me.‎ ‎French press.‎ ‎And a garlic bagel.‎ ‎Extra garlic.‎ ‎Oh, uh... um...‎ ‎I'm doing research for a graphic novel‎ ‎I'm writing about vampires.‎ ‎I don't think I'm actually becoming one,‎ ‎'cause that would be crazy.‎ ‎Where's what's-her-face?‎ ‎Latte-and-no-whip-cream girl?‎ ‎Clary, uh...‎ ‎I don't know.‎ ‎She's not... answering my texts.‎ ‎You all right?‎ ‎Okay.‎ ‎You might want to let that brew...‎ ‎Never mind.‎ ‎Not again.‎ ‎Can I do something for you?‎ ‎I need a list of everything seized‎ ‎from Detective Garroway's desk.‎ ‎And I need a slice of pizza.‎ ‎The list. Now. Full inventory.‎ ‎Bring it up with my office.‎ ‎I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful,‎ ‎but, uh, I...‎ ‎Apparently, I'm not the only one.‎ ‎She must smell a rat.‎ ‎An IA rat.‎ ‎You know what?‎ ‎I'm gonna bring Alec with me next time.‎ ‎I don't think he's ever‎ ‎slapped me in the face.‎ ‎-Someone call for backup?‎ ‎-Yeah. What took you guys so long?‎ ‎Funny, I was gonna ask you‎ ‎the same thing.‎ ‎It's complicated.‎ ‎-We found the Cup.‎ ‎-The Cup?‎ ‎Yeah, but then we lost it.‎ ‎We have to sneak back‎ ‎in the precinct to get it.‎ ‎This is a disaster.‎ ‎Hey, demon pox is a disaster.‎ ‎This is an inconvenience.‎ ‎We just need a plan. That's all.‎ ‎-What about a glamour?‎ ‎-We tried that.‎ ‎Anyone working with Valentine‎ ‎will see right through it.‎ ‎Can we ask Magnus Bane‎ ‎to portal us inside?‎ ‎-No.‎ ‎-That'd be awkward.‎ ‎Magnus can only portal us‎ ‎to places he's been to before.‎ ‎Not again.‎ ‎Just give me a second.‎ ‎Simon, this is really not a good time.‎ ‎Clary, where are you?‎ ‎This is an emergency.‎ ‎Simon, are you okay?‎ ‎I'm not sure.‎ ‎I haven't been kidnapped yet today.‎ ‎Simon, seriously, what's going on?‎ ‎I think I'm sick.‎ ‎Like, really sick.‎ ‎Simon, remember that time‎ ‎you thought you had the bird flu?‎ ‎Okay, just stay off the Internet‎ ‎and you'll be fine.‎ ‎-Hey--‎ ‎-This time I'm really--‎ ‎Oh, my God.‎ ‎She hung up on me.‎ ‎Simon's little problem can wait.‎ ‎I've got a great plan.‎ ‎Oh, there's a first.‎ ‎Oh, and don't worry, in my plan,‎ ‎no one gets slapped.‎ ‎Thanks, Jerry.‎ ‎I appreciate it.‎ ‎We're done for today.‎ ‎But don't go too far.‎ ‎You'll be hearing from me.‎ ‎I wouldn't dream of it.‎ ‎Listen, Garroway, do you think‎ ‎I'm trying to be a pain in your ass?‎ ‎Well, the thought had occurred to me.‎ ‎Dude, we've got your car‎ ‎wrapped around a street light,‎ ‎drenched in blood, carrying a GPS‎ ‎that puts you at the scene of the crime.‎ ‎I'm not a bad guy.‎ ‎I'm just not stupid.‎ ‎Vargas was a good cop.‎ ‎She was my friend.‎ ‎One of the few.‎ ‎Your friends seem to have a habit‎ ‎of turning up dead.‎ ‎I can't even imagine‎ ‎what your Facebook page looks like.‎ ‎You think I killed her?‎ ‎In fact, I think I'm your alibi.‎ ‎Well, I'd appreciate that.‎ ‎Don't thank me just yet.‎ ‎I still haven't figured out your deal.‎ ‎Even a blind guy can tell‎ ‎something weird is going on.‎ ‎You want to do right by Vargas?‎ ‎Help me out here.‎ ‎You wouldn't believe me if I told you.‎ ‎Try me.‎ ‎Think about it.‎ ‎The ME have a time of death?‎ ‎but early guess is she's been dead‎ ‎a couple of hours.‎ ‎No way. I just talked to the captain‎ ‎45 minutes ago.‎ ‎You guys are killing me.‎ ‎Check the body for venom.‎ ‎If it's a demon, I need to know‎ ‎exactly what I'm looking for.‎ ‎Okay.‎ ‎Simon...‎ ‎can we have a talk?‎ ‎We?‎ ‎You, me and your sister.‎ ‎Do I have a choice?‎ ‎Well, I've already ducked out‎ ‎of the office early, so...‎ ‎no.‎ ‎Okay.‎ ‎I stayed out last night at Maureen's. I...‎ ‎So, what are you gonna do?‎ ‎Ground me?‎ ‎Maureen called us this morning‎ ‎and she was very upset.‎ ‎Actually, Maureen called me...‎ ‎and she said that you were spazzing out,‎ ‎like, more than normal.‎ ‎She said...‎ ‎She did what?‎ ‎Well, I just tried to say‎ ‎that's kind of how you are with girls,‎ ‎but, uh, she was very upset, so...‎ ‎-I told Mom.‎ ‎-You did what?‎ ‎Simon, Maureen thinks that...‎ ‎that you might be on drugs.‎ ‎And listen,‎ ‎if I thought it was just marijuana‎ ‎I wouldn't be so worried, but, honey...‎ ‎you look like you're dying.‎ ‎I know that I'm not usually‎ ‎the sentimental one here, but...‎ ‎You can tell us, whatever it is.‎ ‎Okay, okay, um...‎ ‎I think I have a disease.‎ ‎Okay, let's let him finish talking.‎ ‎Look, Simon,‎ ‎it's really not as bad as you think.‎ ‎These things happen, all right?‎ ‎When I was in law school, I experimented--‎ ‎We're really off track here.‎ ‎I think we really need to focus on Simon.‎ ‎-Mom, I'm more than happy--‎ ‎-I had a life.‎ ‎I'm still right here.‎ ‎Excuse me?‎ ‎Shut up!‎ ‎Simon?‎ ‎So, I was promised a great plan.‎ ‎We'll head up towards the vault.‎ ‎Alec and Izzy are handling the rest.‎ ‎All we have to do‎ ‎is wait for their signal...‎ ‎-He's on our side.‎ ‎-You sure?‎ ‎Isn't that the line he used‎ ‎when he kidnapped you?‎ ‎Good point.‎ ‎What now? We're supposed‎ ‎to climb the elevator shaft‎ ‎and waltz in the vault unnoticed?‎ ‎Now, why didn't I think of that?‎ ‎Wait, you're kidding, right?‎ ‎-Remember the binoculars?‎ ‎-Yeah.‎ ‎This one's a Nyx rune.‎ ‎It's like night vision.‎ ‎You can copy mine.‎ ‎-You got it?‎ ‎-Yeah.‎ ‎-Why do I need night vision?‎ ‎-You'll see.‎ ‎Um...‎ ‎Feel free to ask for help.‎ ‎I, um...‎ ‎I think I can take it from here.‎ ‎Where's the fun in that?‎ ‎Nope.‎ ‎I've decided to grow up, remember?‎ ‎No more distracting for me.‎ ‎Besides,‎ ‎I don't think I'm her type.‎ ‎Oh, crap.‎ ‎-Don't worry, it's good practice.‎ ‎-Huh?‎ ‎You know, for asking out Magnus.‎ ‎What are you... what are you doing?‎ ‎Unbuttoning your shirt.‎ ‎What's it look like I'm doing?‎ ‎You do this sort of stuff all the time.‎ ‎-You do, I don't.‎ ‎-It's easy.‎ ‎Come on.‎ ‎Hey.‎ ‎-Can I help you?‎ ‎-Yeah, um...‎ ‎I work here.‎ ‎What can I help you with?‎ ‎Right, um...‎ ‎Right, right, right, yeah, um...‎ ‎Yeah, I'm just...‎ ‎I'm looking for some information.‎ ‎Oh, look...‎ ‎Oh, wow.‎ ‎I'm so sorry.‎ ‎Let me just get that.‎ ‎That's not... I'm so sorry.‎ ‎That's such a mess.‎ ‎Let me clean that up.‎ ‎-Uh, it's not working. Okay.‎ ‎-Here, let me.‎ ‎No, I got it. I got it. Just go. Go.‎ ‎-You sure?‎ ‎-Go.‎ ‎Thank you so much.‎ ‎I think you messed something up.‎ ‎Really?‎ ‎No, I didn't.‎ ‎-Then why isn't it working?‎ ‎-It is.‎ ‎Whoa.‎ ‎Right?‎ ‎Going up.‎ ‎No lights, no camera, no nothing.‎ ‎-Get anything on our killer?‎ ‎-Yeah, you were right.‎ ‎Huge amounts of demon venom‎ ‎in Vargas' blood.‎ ‎-It's a shapeshifter.‎ ‎-All right.‎ ‎I'm going after it. Alert the pack.‎ ‎Anyone sees Vargas, kill her.‎ ‎You were trapped in the precinct all day.‎ ‎If that demon wanted you dead,‎ ‎it certainly had the opportunity.‎ ‎It's not after me. It's after Clary.‎ ‎Otherwise, I wouldn't be‎ ‎asking for your help.‎ ‎You're pack leader now.‎ ‎You don't need to ask.‎ ‎Thanks, bud.‎ ‎What is all this crap?‎ ‎Lunch receipts?‎ ‎Well, at least we know‎ ‎he's not a Downworlder.‎ ‎Lucky for us.‎ ‎Give me a heads up‎ ‎next time you're gonna do that.‎ ‎In here.‎ ‎This will take all day.‎ ‎Or you could just do that.‎ ‎That looks exactly like the Mortal Cup.‎ ‎This is it.‎ ‎It has to be.‎ ‎What's wrong?‎ ‎You're not sure what's wrong‎ ‎or you're not sure‎ ‎where your mom hid the Cup?‎ ‎-Did you get it?‎ ‎-Theoretically.‎ ‎I found the card.‎ ‎I just have to figure out‎ ‎how I reached into‎ ‎my notebook before. It's...‎ ‎-It's not an exact science.‎ ‎-Can't you just pull the Cup out?‎ ‎I can, theoretically. I just...‎ ‎It's not as easy as it looks, Alec.‎ ‎Listen, you two can discuss theory‎ ‎as much as you want‎ ‎when we get back to the Institute.‎ ‎But right now, considering we just stole‎ ‎from the cops, I suggest we get home.‎ ‎I think the mundanes‎ ‎might be the least of our worries.‎ ‎Well, at least we know‎ ‎the demon necklace works.‎ ‎Never a dull day. Let's go.‎ ‎Guys, slow down.‎ ‎What the hell?‎ ‎Language.‎ ‎Not in front of Grandma.‎ ‎How did it find us?‎ ‎-but she brought friends.‎ ‎-How can you tell?‎ ‎It's like seeing through a glamour.‎ ‎You just got to pay attention‎ ‎to the details.‎ ‎But I can't see anything.‎ ‎Behind us.‎ ‎I... I still can't see them.‎ ‎Okay, there's too many people.‎ ‎I don't say this often,‎ ‎but I agree with Clary.‎ ‎-We gotta get out of here.‎ ‎-Hey, this way!‎ ‎Open sesame.‎ ‎Hey, what are you doing?‎ ‎Holding them off.‎ ‎Take Clary back to the Institute.‎ ‎No, if you're staying, I'm staying.‎ ‎We fight together.‎ ‎Don't be stupid. If the demons‎ ‎get the Cup, we're dead anyways.‎ ‎-I'm not leaving anyone behind.‎ ‎-You don't have a choice.‎ ‎I know you guys are having a moment, okay?‎ ‎But we really have to go.‎ ‎I doubt it'd be the last.‎ ‎Go.‎ ‎-I need you--‎ ‎-You've reached Clary's phone.‎ ‎I'm not here, but you know the deal.‎ ‎Um, Clary...‎ ‎I think I need to talk to you more‎ ‎than I've ever needed‎ ‎to talk to you in my life.‎ ‎I know you're busy‎ ‎saving your mom, but...‎ ‎I think I'm becoming a vampire.‎ ‎Darling, you don't know the half of it.‎ ‎Blood is stronger than will.‎ ‎Come to me.‎ ‎-I'm sorry, Jace.‎ ‎-It's okay. We can take a breather.‎ ‎I'll scout ahead.‎ ‎I'm sorry for all the trouble‎ ‎I've put you through.‎ ‎You don't have‎ ‎to apologize to me, Clary.‎ ‎Unfortunately, you can't stop me.‎ ‎Just... I've been so focused‎ ‎on trying to find my mom,‎ ‎I don't think I realized how much‎ ‎you've actually done for me.‎ ‎So, thank you.‎ ‎Clary, I'm a Shadowhunter.‎ ‎It's kinda my job.‎ ‎You... Your job?‎ ‎Yeah.‎ ‎Oh, you'd do this for anybody?‎ ‎Maybe not Simon.‎ ‎Funny, I think he'd say‎ ‎the same thing about you.‎ ‎You know, you're not too bad yourself.‎ ‎-Me?‎ ‎-Yeah.‎ ‎You kicked some pretty serious ass‎ ‎back at the police station.‎ ‎At least, you got my ass kicked.‎ ‎Thanks... I think.‎ ‎Guys? It's pulsing.‎ ‎Again?‎ ‎Getting close.‎ ‎Let's spread out.‎ ‎-Izzy, where is it?‎ ‎-I don't know.‎ ‎It's like they're right here,‎ ‎but I don't see them.‎ ‎-Are you hurt?‎ ‎-I'll live.‎ ‎-What are those things?‎ ‎-Shax demons.‎ ‎They're like the bloodhounds‎ ‎of the Shadow World.‎ ‎-They've been tracking us.‎ ‎-So what do we do?‎ ‎The Institute's only‎ ‎a couple of blocks from here.‎ ‎We can't lose them, but they won't‎ ‎be able to track us if we split up.‎ ‎-But, I don't... I don't--‎ ‎-Clary, you'll be fine.‎ ‎Izzy and I will draw them away.‎ ‎No matter what happens,‎ ‎just keep running.‎ ‎-Jace, I--‎ ‎-Run, Clary!‎ ‎Get back!‎ ‎I said, get back!‎ ‎Hey, I ordered in Rizzo's.‎ ‎Are you okay?‎ ‎I've never heard him‎ ‎this quiet around pasta before.‎ ‎-Go.‎ ‎-Yeah? Okay.‎ ‎All right, Simon, I'm coming in.‎ ‎Oh, my God.‎ ‎Jace!‎ ‎Jace?‎ ‎Clary.‎ ‎Hey.‎ ‎-Oh, you're hurt!‎ ‎-I'll be all right.‎ ‎-You okay?‎ ‎-Yeah, I'm...‎ ‎I'm fine. Barely, but--‎ ‎-What happened?‎ ‎-One of the Shax demons cornered me.‎ ‎But I got the Cup.‎ ‎I don't know, my instincts just kicked in‎ ‎and I... I could do it.‎ ‎Maybe you're right.‎ ‎Maybe I'll be a Shadowhunter after all.‎ ‎Clary, you're amazing.‎ ‎I always knew you could do it.‎ ‎Now give me the Cup and let's go.‎ ‎Only until we get back‎ ‎to the Institute.‎ ‎It's the only way‎ ‎I can keep you safe.‎ ‎I'll die before I let‎ ‎anything happen to you.‎ ‎Yeah, you're totally right.‎ ‎How do I know you're Luke?‎ ‎-What happened?‎ ‎-Uh, demons.‎ ‎-Where'd you come from?‎ ‎-Jail.‎ ‎I ran into Alec.‎ ‎Said you might be down here.‎ ‎Thought you might need some help.‎ ‎Apparently not.‎ ‎Looks like she took care of it.‎ ‎Shouldn't we get going or something?‎ ‎-More demons could be coming, right?‎ ‎-Oh, don't worry about it.‎ ‎I got the pack on the lookout.‎ ‎If there's any other demons,‎ ‎we'll take care of them.‎ ‎Well, you know, it has its perks.‎ ‎Shall we?‎ ‎Yeah. Right.‎ ‎These tunnels‎ ‎are swarming with Shax demons.‎ ‎If she's down there, it's only‎ ‎a matter of time before they find her.‎ ‎We need to make sure‎ ‎that doesn't happen.‎ ‎All right, listen up. I want‎ ‎this entire Institute on high alert.‎ ‎I don't care what anybody else says,‎ ‎I'll take full responsibility.‎ ‎Right now,‎ ‎Clary is the only thing that matters.‎ ‎Jace!‎ ‎Clary.‎ ‎I did it. I got the Cup.‎ ‎I don't care about the Cup.‎ ‎When I came out of the tunnels,‎ ‎I didn't see you. I was worried‎ ‎-something might have happened--‎ ‎-There was a demon.‎ ‎Shapeshifter. It looked just like you.‎ ‎-You all right?‎ ‎-Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.‎ ‎And the demon?‎ ‎I sent him straight back to hell.‎ ‎How'd you know it wasn't me?‎ ‎-I just knew.‎ ‎-Really?‎ ‎Kind of a risk, wasn't it?‎ ‎Well, this may come as a surprise,‎ ‎but I actually do listen‎ ‎to some of the things you tell me.‎ ‎You just have to pay attention‎ ‎to the details.‎ ‎Yeah, well, I told you the first time‎ ‎we met, you have the Sight.‎ ‎You're a Shadowhunter,‎ ‎just like the rest of us.‎ ‎Anybody home?‎ ‎You don't have a doorbell, so I...‎ ‎I let myself in.‎ ‎Raphael?‎ ‎All right, I know‎ ‎someone's here somewhere!‎ ‎Please!‎ ‎I think I'm sick.‎ ‎I need someone to tell me what's going on,‎ ‎because it's ruining my life!‎ ‎Am I becoming a vampire?‎ ‎Poor darling boy.‎ ‎I was wondering‎ ‎when you'd come back.‎ ‎You...‎ ‎You're not mad?‎ ‎On the contrary,‎ ‎I've been expecting you.‎ ‎You see... it's just my blood running‎ ‎through your veins.‎ ‎It can have some curious effects.‎ ‎But I assure you,‎ ‎they're all harmless.‎ ‎In time, they'll fade‎ ‎and you'll return to normal.‎ ‎Thank God. Um...‎ ‎Well, of course you are.‎ ‎Or at least you would've been.‎ The Clave thinks our family honor's beyond repair."
00:00:18.393,00:00:20.770,It's gonna require a tremendous sacrifice.
00:00:27.069,00:00:28.861,more than I've ever needed to talk to you in my life.
00:00:28.945,00:00:30.488,I think I'm becoming a vampire.
00:00:33.116,00:00:35.868,-I got the Cup. -I don't care about the Cup.
00:00:41.916,00:00:43.960,It just looks like a wine glass.
00:00:44.043,00:00:46.671,That wine glass saved your life.
00:00:46.754,00:00:49.757,What if... what if I hadn't gotten the Cup out in time?
00:00:49.841,00:00:51.926,-That demon-- -But you did.
00:00:52.009,00:00:53.761,First rule of Shadowhunting...
00:00:53.845,00:00:56.056,"when something explodes, just keep walking."
00:00:57.014,00:01:00.310,Never think twice. Never look away.
00:01:00.393,00:01:01.978,And what's the second rule?
00:01:05.440,00:01:08.068,There's nothing a Shadowhunter can't do in heels.
00:01:12.614,00:01:15.950,"You can stare at this monitor all you want, they need angel blood to get past the wards."
00:01:16.033,00:01:17.244,You know that.
00:01:22.790,00:01:24.667,Not without an invite by a Shadowhunter.
00:01:24.751,00:01:27.712,"Last I checked, Valentine is a Shadowhunter."
00:01:27.795,00:01:30.298,The Cup is not safe here. We have to give it back to the Clave.
00:01:30.382,00:01:31.883,Give it back to the Clave? No.
00:01:31.966,00:01:33.718,Not after everything we went through to get it.
00:01:33.801,00:01:35.137,My brother is right.
00:01:37.054,00:01:38.431,Are you agreeing with me?
00:01:39.182,00:01:40.183,I'm full of surprises.
00:01:40.267,00:01:42.977,This Cup is the one chance I have at getting my mom back.
00:01:43.770,00:01:44.812,I agree with Clary.
00:01:45.522,00:01:47.857,"We can't give the Cup to the Clave, not now."
00:01:47.940,00:01:49.151,We need it.
00:01:50.067,00:01:53.905,"-It's our only bargaining chip. -Look, I know how powerful this Cup is."
00:01:53.988,00:01:59.577,"It has the power to create new Shadowhunters, control demons and even kill a mundane if they drank from it."
00:01:59.661,00:02:03.873,"But I promise you, I will not let that monster get his hands on it."
00:02:03.956,00:02:07.043,There you go. You have her word.
00:02:10.963,00:02:11.964,Follow me.
00:02:30.358,00:02:32.944,"Alec, I realize I couldn't have done any of this without your help."
00:02:34.196,00:02:35.322,I wanna thank you.
00:02:36.781,00:02:38.450,Don't misread this as friendship.
00:02:38.533,00:02:41.494,"Since you've arrived, our whole world's been turned upside down."
00:02:58.428,00:03:00.222,"Simon, sorry I didn't get back to you sooner."
00:03:00.305,00:03:01.514,Been crazy busy.
00:03:01.598,00:03:05.184,We found the Cup. I have so much to tell you.
00:03:06.269,00:03:07.312,Call me back.
00:03:18.072,00:03:19.198,-I told you-- -Don't say it.
00:03:20.367,00:03:23.286,-Looks like someone's trying to break in. -Could be the Circle.
00:03:38.718,00:03:41.388,Drop what you're holding. Put your hands up.
00:03:49.354,00:03:51.606,"Oh, my God, Simon!"
00:04:10.500,00:04:13.085,People will be wondering what we found outside the perimeter.
00:04:17.089,00:04:18.258,Nobody will come down here.
00:04:23.680,00:04:25.598,but I was raised a good Catholic.
00:04:33.315,00:04:35.358,Killing Simon is grounds for war.
00:04:35.442,00:04:37.402,The vampires were not behind this.
00:04:37.944,00:04:40.947,Just Camille. She attacked Simon on her own.
00:04:41.030,00:04:42.407,And how do we know you're telling the truth?
00:04:42.490,00:04:45.242,"I could have gotten rid of him, but instead I brought him here."
00:04:46.035,00:04:47.787,I don't want trouble with the Shadowhunters.
00:04:47.870,00:04:49.080,Smart decision.
00:04:49.163,00:04:51.791,I warned the mundane to stay away...
00:04:51.874,00:04:55.002,"but Camille gave him a taste of her own blood, and like an addict..."
00:04:55.670,00:04:57.004,he came back wanting more.
00:04:58.089,00:05:01.258,The only reason Simon ever tasted Camille's blood is because of you.
00:05:02.093,00:05:05.137,You kidnapped him! You drug him to Hotel DuMort. You...
00:05:05.221,00:05:06.514,You delivered him to Camille!
00:05:06.598,00:05:08.808,I never meant for this to happen.
00:05:21.779,00:05:22.989,There is a way.
00:05:24.073,00:05:25.533,A way what?
00:05:29.746,00:05:31.331,How? How?
00:05:31.414,00:05:32.540,He's a fledgling.
00:05:33.500,00:05:36.961,It's a state of transition. Your friend can be resurrected.
00:05:37.044,00:05:38.505,"-No. -Clary, no."
00:05:41.591,00:05:43.926,-Alive and breathing? -That's just it.
00:05:47.972,00:05:49.432,He'll be a vampire.
00:05:52.644,00:05:54.771,"The ugly, bloodsucking, coffin-dwelling kind."
00:05:54.854,00:05:56.939,-That's offensive. -Really?
00:05:57.732,00:06:00.026,Coffin implies wooden box.
00:06:00.109,00:06:03.405,We have caskets now. They're made of 14-karat gold.
00:06:05.782,00:06:07.450,It's almost sunrise.
00:06:08.785,00:06:11.829,Simon must be turned into a vampire tonight or staked through the heart.
00:06:13.080,00:06:14.373,And if I do neither?
00:06:15.291,00:06:16.876,His soul will be trapped for eternity.
00:06:18.169,00:06:20.046,You have till sunset to decide.
00:06:21.297,00:06:22.298,The clock is ticking.
00:06:31.015,00:06:33.225,Remember what you said to me the morning of our wedding?
00:06:35.019,00:06:38.064,"We weren't supposed to see each other until the ceremony, but you..."
00:06:39.482,00:06:40.858,you wouldn't listen to rules.
00:06:41.443,00:06:42.610,You never did.
00:06:50.452,00:06:52.787,You told me our hearts...
00:06:52.870,00:06:55.540,beat as one and that we would be together forever.
00:06:58.626,00:07:00.753,I hope you've returned with good news.
00:07:01.463,00:07:02.755,The girl has the Cup.
00:07:04.006,00:07:05.341,"Do you hear that, Jocelyn?"
00:07:06.258,00:07:07.469,Clarissa did it.
00:07:08.385,00:07:12.724,It's evident she has your determination and my curiosity.
00:07:16.393,00:07:18.896,"Did you really think I wouldn't figure it out, hmm?"
00:07:20.523,00:07:24.276,You left 18 years ago with my unborn daughter.
00:07:25.236,00:07:28.197,"I guess we'll just have to make up for lost time, hmm?"
00:07:30.324,00:07:31.993,If she found the Cup...
00:07:33.077,00:07:34.078,where is it?
00:07:35.955,00:07:38.040,Lucian Graymark got in the way.
00:07:38.124,00:07:41.753,-Got in the way how? -He's the leader of the New York pack now.
00:07:41.836,00:07:43.505,She's under their protection.
00:07:45.422,00:07:46.966,"Oh, Lucian."
00:07:48.175,00:07:51.554,Always so chivalrous.
00:07:53.139,00:07:56.183,and we're just sitting here on the sidelines waiting...
00:07:59.604,00:08:00.730,"Oh, that's a joke, Maryse."
00:08:00.813,00:08:02.940,You and I both know how the Clave handles things.
00:08:12.992,00:08:14.410,Said to start without him.
00:08:14.494,00:08:15.828,I'm sure he has a good reason.
00:08:18.455,00:08:24.712,"Okay, I requested a meeting at the Clave to inform them that the Seelies are siding with Valentine."
00:08:24.796,00:08:26.213,And the Clave denied it.
00:08:26.297,00:08:28.841,What do you mean? They don't want you coming to Idris?
00:08:28.925,00:08:32.512,There are rumors that local Shadowhunters have been interfering in Downworld affairs.
00:08:32.595,00:08:35.097,"But you two wouldn't know anything about that, right?"
00:08:36.098,00:08:37.099,-Nada. -No.
00:08:39.519,00:08:41.979,they are concerned with our devotion to our job and the cause.
00:08:42.063,00:08:43.397,But we're the Lightwoods.
00:08:43.480,00:08:46.192,"Remember, the honor isn't in the name..."
00:08:46.275,00:08:47.401,it's in the deed.
00:08:48.861,00:08:50.237,The Clave is sending an envoy.
00:08:52.364,00:08:54.701,And to gather information about Valentine to report back.
00:08:54.784,00:09:02.249,"But really to scrutinize our leadership, so I beg of the two of you, don't do anything that would cause the Clave to lose even more trust in us."
00:09:08.380,00:09:11.718,I think I'm turning into a vampire. I'm scared.
00:09:16.305,00:09:17.974,I'm so sorry I wasn't there.
00:09:24.230,00:09:25.815,"-Clary, this isn't your-- -No, it is!"
00:09:27.775,00:09:31.362,"If it weren't for me, Simon would have never even known about the Shadow World."
00:09:38.035,00:09:39.370,He wouldn't be dead.
00:09:39.954,00:09:42.624,Fledgling. He's in transition.
00:09:43.499,00:09:45.752,And now I am left with two...
00:09:58.180,00:09:59.348,"If I, uh..."
00:10:05.813,00:10:07.398,"-what are the risks? -Clary, no. Absolutely not."
00:10:07.481,00:10:08.608,"Jace, I need to know!"
00:10:13.946,00:10:17.700,he would be trapped under the earth... starving for eternity.
00:10:18.951,00:10:20.244,"Oh, my God."
00:10:24.206,00:10:25.416,"And, uh..."
00:10:31.881,00:10:33.049,He'll die a human death.
00:10:33.132,00:10:35.301,"It's painless, as far as I know."
00:10:46.562,00:10:49.774,"Alec, you think you could get my stele back?"
00:10:49.857,00:10:52.484,They took it away because you nearly burned down the Mumbai Institute.
00:10:52.568,00:10:55.279,How many times do I have to say it was an accident?
00:10:55.362,00:10:56.447,"Look, Max."
00:11:00.743,00:11:03.663,You think you can stay out of trouble for just a couple days?
00:11:03.746,00:11:06.082,"If you do, I promise I'll get your stele back."
00:11:41.993,00:11:43.160,Except for you.
00:11:44.203,00:11:47.790,"I'm Lydia Branwell, envoy from the Clave."
00:11:51.252,00:11:54.839,The Clave has ordered me to take temporary control of this Institute.
00:11:54.922,00:11:57.049,Wait a minute. Nobody informed us.
00:11:57.133,00:11:58.467,The Clave doesn't need to.
00:11:58.550,00:12:03.222,"And, to repeat myself, it's temporary."
00:12:05.724,00:12:10.521,But I do need full clearance in order to assess how this Institute is running.
00:12:13.107,00:12:14.984,Where is Clary Fairchild?
00:12:16.568,00:12:18.695,I would hope someone here knows.
00:12:18.780,00:12:20.447,"She's in the field, training."
00:12:21.198,00:12:25.787,You're telling me she's just... out and about in the streets of New York?
00:12:27.079,00:12:28.414,Valentine's daughter?
00:12:28.497,00:12:30.833,Isn't she also your cousin?
00:12:30.917,00:12:32.293,Distant cousin.
00:12:33.544,00:12:34.921,She's with Jace.
00:12:35.838,00:12:40.885,The same Jace Wayland who decided to lead an unsanctioned raid against the vampires?
00:12:41.803,00:12:42.887,I've read reports.
00:12:42.970,00:12:45.514,"Jace might be unconventional, but he's our best soldier."
00:12:45.597,00:12:47.391,"If he's with Clary, then she's in good hands."
00:12:47.474,00:12:48.475,I hope so.
00:12:49.143,00:12:51.145,"And for your sake, all of New York."
00:12:52.313,00:12:55.066,All of your jurisdiction better be well protected.
00:13:53.832,00:13:55.001,This is a bad idea.
00:13:57.294,00:13:58.712,...that Simon was bitten by a vampire.
00:13:58.795,00:13:59.922,I promise.
00:14:01.966,00:14:06.012,'Cause part of our job as Shadowhunters is making sure mundanes don't-- Know the truth?
00:14:06.095,00:14:07.889,Don't know anything about the Shadow World.
00:14:07.972,00:14:09.681,"Don't worry, I'm just gonna..."
00:14:14.478,00:14:15.687,"That, um..."
00:14:21.360,00:14:24.071,I owe his mother that much. She loves him.
00:14:26.532,00:14:29.118,"I haven't heard anything from Simon since yesterday, Clary."
00:14:30.036,00:14:31.745,And he flipped out on Rebecca and I.
00:14:31.828,00:14:33.414,And then just disappeared.
00:14:34.665,00:14:37.376,Have you heard from him? Or have you seen him?
00:14:38.502,00:14:40.880,-Should I be calling the police? -No.
00:14:40.963,00:14:42.423,"No, don't do that. Um..."
00:14:44.383,00:14:46.135,"If we needed to, I would have called Luke."
00:14:47.386,00:14:49.388,I just want to know if he's all right.
00:14:53.893,00:14:56.187,"Oh, my God. You did? Where?"
00:15:14.956,00:15:17.416,"Whatever it is, I can handle it."
00:15:33.349,00:15:34.683,What...
00:15:44.818,00:15:47.154,-Be careful. -I will.
00:15:54.745,00:15:57.914,Simon got this for me for Mother's Day.
00:15:57.999,00:16:00.667,"You know, 'cause he's my little... monkey."
00:16:03.420,00:16:06.132,"Clary, I don't know what I'd do if anything happened to him."
00:16:07.133,00:16:09.260,"Rebecca and Simon, they're all I have."
00:16:21.522,00:16:23.357,To tell me the truth...
00:16:25.609,00:16:26.735,Um...
00:16:30.822,00:16:32.491,-Jealous? -No.
00:16:34.994,00:16:36.912,How the hell did she catch that arrow?
00:16:42.709,00:16:44.545,Something attacked the Jade Wolf.
00:16:46.630,00:16:49.633,The werewolves' headquarters? Where did you-- Where did you get these?
00:16:49.716,00:16:52.053,Leader of the New York wolf pack.
00:16:52.136,00:16:55.056,You're friends with Lucian Graymark? An ex-Circle member?
00:16:55.139,00:16:58.892,How about we send Isabelle and Alec to investigate?
00:17:01.353,00:17:02.646,I need to see it for myself.
00:17:07.484,00:17:09.153,Are you coming or what?
00:17:17.078,00:17:18.079,Clary...
00:17:19.038,00:17:20.497,what happened to the plan?
00:17:21.415,00:17:24.251,"-Tell her that Simon's not coming home. -I tried, okay?"
00:17:24.335,00:17:25.794,I just... I can't.
00:17:25.877,00:17:27.963,I'm not ready to just give up on Simon.
00:17:29.756,00:17:31.800,"Would you stop for a second, think about what you're doing?"
00:17:31.883,00:17:32.884,"I am, Jace, okay?"
00:17:35.262,00:17:37.556,and my heart another and...
00:17:40.642,00:17:41.685,Okay. Look...
00:17:43.354,00:17:44.813,there was a boy...
00:17:46.107,00:17:49.901,and his father bought him a falcon for his sixth birthday.
00:17:49.985,00:17:52.488,Are you seriously telling me a story right now?
00:17:52.571,00:17:53.864,"Please, just listen."
00:17:54.781,00:17:57.243,His father told him to tame the bird.
00:17:58.327,00:17:59.370,Make it obedient.
00:17:59.453,00:18:01.163,That's crazy.
00:18:01.247,00:18:03.582,And the boy would spend every day with that falcon.
00:18:03.665,00:18:06.502,It would scratch at him.
00:18:06.585,00:18:07.794,Make him bleed.
00:18:07.878,00:18:09.130,But eventually...
00:18:10.131,00:18:11.590,he earned its trust.
00:18:11.673,00:18:16.637,"He brought the bird to his father, to show him that the bird would come back to him."
00:18:18.597,00:18:20.641,He thought his father would be proud.
00:18:20.724,00:18:23.852,"-And he was, right? -No, Clary."
00:18:23.935,00:18:27.856,His father took the falcon and snapped its neck.
00:18:27.939,00:18:30.942,"Okay, that is the worst story I have ever heard."
00:18:31.026,00:18:32.736,You're missing the point.
00:18:32.819,00:18:36.407,Yes... the boy was devastated.
00:18:38.284,00:18:40.369,But he realized his father was right.
00:18:41.953,00:18:43.664,He was told to tame the bird...
00:18:46.125,00:18:47.793,not to love it.
00:18:50.421,00:18:52.256,That's why you have to listen to your head.
00:18:53.089,00:18:54.716,If I listened to my heart...
00:18:55.676,00:18:57.386,I'd never be able to do my job.
00:18:58.387,00:19:00.389,Third rule of Shadowhunting...
00:19:00.472,00:19:02.683,emotions cloud judgment.
00:19:03.434,00:19:04.726,"Jace, if..."
00:19:06.187,00:19:09.315,if being a Shadowhunter means that I have to be dead inside...
00:19:11.066,00:19:12.901,I'm not sure I want to be one.
00:19:24.079,00:19:27.123,I can see why all the girls in Idris are clamoring to meet you.
00:19:27.208,00:19:28.209,What do you mean?
00:19:28.292,00:19:30.836,Rumor has it you're looking to settle down...
00:19:30.919,00:19:33.464,-get married. -Damn it.
00:19:33.547,00:19:35.048,Let me guess. Not your idea?
00:19:35.131,00:19:38.385,"-Not even close. -My parents tried to set me up, too."
00:19:38.469,00:19:40.262,And how'd that work out?
00:19:41.430,00:19:43.182,I made my own path.
00:19:43.265,00:19:45.226,Married the love of my life...
00:19:46.435,00:19:47.769,John Monteverde.
00:19:48.979,00:19:51.648,Together we were going to run the Lisbon Institute.
00:19:52.608,00:19:54.735,And then John was killed.
00:19:56.237,00:19:58.154,Everything was ripped away.
00:19:58.239,00:20:00.782,"My love, my dream job..."
00:20:05.412,00:20:09.958,"In this line of work, the only thing worth falling in love with is the work itself."
00:20:10.041,00:20:11.293,"Lydia, I'm..."
00:20:12.253,00:20:13.254,I'm sorry.
00:20:24.473,00:20:25.724,It was human.
00:20:30.103,00:20:32.188,"It was more focused, more determined."
00:20:32.273,00:20:33.732,It attacked like it had a plan.
00:20:36.360,00:20:39.613,"Plus, a normal Forsaken wouldn't have been so hard to kill."
00:20:41.990,00:20:43.325,Never seen anything like it.
00:20:43.992,00:20:47.246,"We'll take the body back to the Institute, do a full autopsy."
00:20:47.329,00:20:49.956,"Oh, hold up. I get that I called you..."
00:20:50.832,00:20:52.251,"Actually, I called Alec."
00:20:52.334,00:20:54.836,But what I didn't want is someone to come down here and just take over.
00:20:56.087,00:20:57.923,"Yeah, that's kind of her thing."
00:20:58.840,00:21:03.178,"Look, I know I can come across... abrasive."
00:21:03.845,00:21:05.180,But we're all on the same side here.
00:21:05.889,00:21:07.098,Can we agree on that?
00:21:08.224,00:21:11.395,The Institute has the resources to find out what this thing is.
00:21:14.064,00:21:16.275,Highly trained in all the creatures of the Shadow World.
00:21:19.278,00:21:21.572,"In this, uh, Chinese restaurant?"
00:21:23.490,00:21:25.617,Fine. You win.
00:21:25.701,00:21:27.202,Just let me know what you find.
00:21:29.330,00:21:30.831,You think Valentine was behind this?
00:21:33.917,00:21:35.586,What do you think he's after?
00:21:37.504,00:21:38.505,Me.
00:21:38.589,00:21:41.467,So you think Valentine's going after ex-Circle members?
00:21:44.177,00:21:47.055,We have a complicated past.
00:21:47.138,00:21:49.224,"But of course, he could be going after the old crew."
00:21:49.308,00:21:52.311,I'm sure Valentine has a grudge against anybody who turned against him.
00:21:52.394,00:21:54.730,We'll put extra wards on the Institute.
00:21:54.813,00:21:56.523,"Right, for Hodge."
00:21:56.607,00:21:58.274,And your parents.
00:22:00.819,00:22:02.738,Did they conceal that from you?
00:22:11.997,00:22:14.500,We need to make sure no magic was used to make this.
00:22:15.459,00:22:18.211,I'm calling the nearest High Warlock to come in to consult.
00:22:18.294,00:22:19.505,Magnus Bane?
00:22:20.547,00:22:22.466,To come here to the Institute?
00:22:23.717,00:22:25.552,"Yes, is there a problem?"
00:22:26.387,00:22:29.139,No. Not at all.
00:22:29.222,00:22:30.599,"Magnus is, um..."
00:22:31.642,00:22:32.643,quite magical.
00:22:34.102,00:22:36.772,"He's, uh, very... very good at magic."
00:22:38.857,00:22:40.526,Do you know him well?
00:22:41.527,00:22:43.654,"Uh, just a little."
00:22:46.657,00:22:56.207,"Did you know that my great ancestor, Henry Branwell, who was the last of the Branwells to run an Institute, No."
00:22:57.208,00:22:59.503,Just add that to the list of things I didn't know.
00:23:06.927,00:23:10.431,You shouldn't have had to find out your parents were ex-Circle members.
00:23:10.514,00:23:12.015,Not like that.
00:23:12.098,00:23:13.850,You mean from you?
00:23:15.310,00:23:17.145,You shouldn't have been the one I found out from.
00:23:17.228,00:23:20.524,You know there's been a ban about talking about the Circle till now.
00:23:20.607,00:23:22.526,"Yeah, how convenient for my parents."
00:23:22.609,00:23:24.945,This doesn't change how I feel about the Lightwoods.
00:23:28.156,00:23:31.910,They've been a powerful force in the Shadow World -and praised for their devotion. -Devotion?
00:23:31.993,00:23:34.287,My parents were in league with Valentine.
00:23:37.749,00:23:39.334,"Yeah, but this one..."
00:23:40.376,00:23:41.670,it's unforgivable.
00:23:54.725,00:23:56.477,"Luke, are you okay?"
00:23:58.061,00:24:00.606,Uh... you should see the other guy.
00:24:00.689,00:24:03.441,"We were attacked by a Forsaken, if you can even call it that."
00:24:04.067,00:24:05.486,"Anyway, it's dead."
00:24:06.737,00:24:08.113,It looks worse than it was.
00:24:09.906,00:24:12.283,Already healed. Perks of being a werewolf.
00:24:12.367,00:24:13.869,"Anyway, I called Alec."
00:24:13.952,00:24:16.371,He took the Forsaken back to the Institute for an autopsy.
00:24:16.454,00:24:18.414,We've got the best forensic pathologist in New York.
00:24:18.499,00:24:19.916,"Yeah, so I've heard."
00:24:20.876,00:24:22.711,"Clary, what are you doing here?"
00:24:22.794,00:24:26.381,"Now that you have the Cup, you know you should be back at the Institute, protected."
00:24:26.464,00:24:27.924,I haven't taken my eyes off her.
00:24:28.008,00:24:29.718,I needed to see you.
00:24:30.761,00:24:32.428,"Luke, it's Simon."
00:24:33.722,00:24:35.431,"He's, um..."
00:24:37.267,00:24:38.727,"Luke, he's dead."
00:24:55.786,00:24:57.579,"Patience is a virtue, my dear."
00:25:00.541,00:25:03.835,"Speaking of which, how is Alexander?"
00:25:03.919,00:25:05.336,I was hoping I might hear from him.
00:25:10.050,00:25:13.011,It's just so hard to tell if Alexander is even interested.
00:25:15.430,00:25:19.184,"I'm not sure if you noticed, but my brother is not exactly warm and fuzzy."
00:25:19.267,00:25:22.312,"Hmm, I suppose. With Clary's arrival..."
00:25:22.395,00:25:23.605,And Valentine's return...
00:25:23.689,00:25:25.816,Mmm-hmm. Running the Institute...
00:25:25.899,00:25:29.194,"-The envoy from the Clave... -Oh, who I hear is very impressive."
00:25:34.908,00:25:37.869,And dealing with our parents who are trying to find him a wife.
00:25:40.872,00:25:41.957,Sorry.
00:25:42.999,00:25:44.585,It's quite all right.
00:25:44.668,00:25:47.629,I suppose Alec is just following his duty.
00:25:48.504,00:25:51.758,Not everyone gets the luxury of following their heart.
00:25:53.176,00:25:55.679,I'm gonna go deliver the preliminary findings.
00:25:56.763,00:25:59.182,It seems like you have everything under control here.
00:26:09.150,00:26:10.777,"Luke, what do I do?"
00:26:12.153,00:26:13.989,"If I bring Simon back, then..."
00:26:14.572,00:26:16.825,He'll be a vampire. A Downworlder.
00:26:31.422,00:26:33.717,But... Valentine loves you.
00:26:33.800,00:26:36.219,"You're his parabatai, his brother."
00:26:36.302,00:26:39.139,-No. -If he could do this to you...
00:26:46.396,00:26:49.482,"Luke, if you kill yourself, he wins."
00:26:55.155,00:26:56.614,What if I attack you after I turn?
00:26:58.283,00:27:01.202,If I hurt you... I couldn't live with myself.
00:27:01.286,00:27:04.580,You don't wanna hurt me. Don't do this.
00:27:04.665,00:27:07.042,Your death... I couldn't survive that.
00:27:12.630,00:27:14.174,-You have to. It's starting. -No.
00:27:23.975,00:27:28.980,"But if you choose to live, I hope you learn to love yourself the way I'll always love you."
00:27:43.619,00:27:44.788,werewolf.
00:27:45.496,00:27:49.375,"Suddenly, I was foraging for food, unable to control my own body."
00:27:53.046,00:27:54.089,my friends.
00:27:54.172,00:27:55.590,But not my mom.
00:27:56.341,00:27:58.134,No.
00:27:58.218,00:27:59.886,Jocelyn never abandoned me.
00:28:01.137,00:28:05.016,Having you and Jocelyn in my life kept me from using this.
00:28:07.352,00:28:08.603,Knowing that you both needed me.
00:28:09.730,00:28:11.689,I will never stop needing you.
00:28:13.024,00:28:16.694,Clary... you know I love Simon like a son.
00:28:17.988,00:28:22.117,"If you decide to bring him back, just know that his journey won't be easy."
00:28:26.204,00:28:28.081,So make sure you do it for him...
00:28:28.164,00:28:29.624,and not yourself.
00:28:35.671,00:28:37.007,The sun is setting.
00:28:38.383,00:28:39.718,Have you decided?
00:29:12.083,00:29:13.084,Magnus.
00:29:15.128,00:29:16.922,"Okay, I'm back."
00:29:20.216,00:29:22.385,"Oh, you don't have to get dressed up for me."
00:29:24.137,00:29:25.806,Fine.
00:29:25.889,00:29:27.140,But I liked what I saw.
00:29:28.474,00:29:30.435,I have the preliminary autopsy findings.
00:29:31.227,00:29:33.021,Why are you giving these to me?
00:29:33.104,00:29:34.522,They should go to the head of the Institute.
00:29:35.190,00:29:36.274,And it is.
00:29:36.357,00:29:38.902,I'm not. And I never will be.
00:29:40.361,00:29:41.737,"Magnus, it's like..."
00:29:42.989,00:29:45.909,it's like my whole life... has been a lie.
00:29:45.992,00:29:48.328,"Now, everything I've ever known is..."
00:29:50.580,00:29:53.583,I've done everything for my parents...
00:29:54.542,00:29:56.211,for the Clave and...
00:30:00.506,00:30:02.843,Maybe you should start living for yourself.
00:30:05.345,00:30:07.347,Do what's in your heart.
00:30:08.974,00:30:10.600,I can't believe I'm saying this.
00:30:50.598,00:30:51.807,What do you want?
00:30:52.976,00:30:54.853,I want my property back.
00:30:55.896,00:30:57.480,Simon is not your property.
00:30:57.563,00:31:00.316,"If you'll just hand him over, I'll be on my way."
00:31:00.400,00:31:02.903,You heard Clary. You're not laying a hand on him.
00:31:02.986,00:31:05.947,Fine. I tried to do this the nice way.
00:31:13.121,00:31:15.831,I'm glad you brought everyone here to witness your demise.
00:31:16.749,00:31:18.960,Camille killed this mundane.
00:31:19.044,00:31:20.795,"Now, I have all the proof."
00:31:20.879,00:31:23.839,She's been breaking the Accords for too long now.
00:31:23.924,00:31:27.135,He's the evidence we need to show the Clave what Camille has been doing.
00:31:29.470,00:31:31.973,Are you trying to overthrow me?
00:31:32.057,00:31:33.058,No.
00:31:34.017,00:31:35.101,I already have.
00:31:35.851,00:31:37.728,Don't listen to him.
00:31:37.812,00:31:40.148,Raphael doesn't know the first thing about leading.
00:31:40.231,00:31:44.986,You need me. I've given you everything you could want.
00:31:50.158,00:31:51.993,Which will only destroy us.
00:31:52.077,00:31:53.995,We can fix this.
00:31:54.079,00:31:57.958,"If we just get rid of the body, this mundane means nothing."
00:31:59.750,00:32:03.671,Means nothing? Over my dead body.
00:32:15.183,00:32:17.227,They will be taking full control of the Institute.
00:32:18.519,00:32:21.606,"You can punish us, but our children did nothing wrong."
00:32:21.689,00:32:24.817,"They've worked so hard-- I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do."
00:32:24.900,00:32:32.658,"With everything that's happened here in New York, plus your history with the Circle, and now Valentine's return, the Clave believes the Institute's at risk."
00:32:32.742,00:32:36.121,We have been trying to stop Valentine. What has the Clave done?
00:32:36.204,00:32:37.622,The answer is nothing.
00:32:39.124,00:32:41.542,They're more concerned about removing us from the Institute.
00:32:45.296,00:32:47.966,We will await the Clave's instructions.
00:32:49.300,00:32:51.261,I have the preliminary results from Magnus.
00:32:51.344,00:32:53.972,No magic was used in creating the Forsaken.
00:32:57.475,00:32:58.476,I'll take them.
00:33:14.659,00:33:15.868,it's time.
00:33:18.371,00:33:19.747,Which will it be?
00:33:58.578,00:34:02.332,"When your grandfather gave you this at your bar mitzvah, you, um..."
00:34:03.499,00:34:05.000,you told me how much it meant to you.
00:34:06.461,00:34:09.214,It was a symbol of the day you became a man.
00:34:15.178,00:34:17.222,"Simon, no matter what happens..."
00:34:18.264,00:34:19.557,no matter what...
00:34:21.142,00:34:22.352,you become...
00:34:25.105,00:34:27.607,you will always be that man to me.
00:35:21.327,00:35:23.078,"Lydia, do you have a minute?"
00:35:23.163,00:35:26.332,"Alec, I'm sorry about your parents, but my hands were tied."
00:35:28.376,00:35:32.880,"The law is hard, but it's the law, and I respect that."
00:35:32.963,00:35:37.051,But I've realized that... I have to listen to my heart.
00:35:39.554,00:35:43.599,I know. And I can't bring John back.
00:35:44.850,00:35:48.729,"But, like you said, our families have been strong allies."
00:35:48.813,00:35:51.941,And we can use that to our advantage.
00:35:52.983,00:35:56.904,"Together, we can restore my family name and we can keep the Institute."
00:35:58.573,00:36:00.450,And we'd get to run it.
00:36:06.956,00:36:09.209,Lydia Branwell...
00:36:09.292,00:36:12.170,"will you marry me, Alec Lightwood?"
00:36:19.093,00:36:20.386,That mundane's a fighter.
00:36:21.304,00:36:23.223,He survived the vampires at the Hotel DuMort.
00:36:23.306,00:36:26.267,He survived the werewolves at Jade Wolf.
00:36:28.186,00:36:29.645,for whatever that's worth.
00:36:30.855,00:36:32.147,"He is a fighter, isn't he?"
00:36:33.691,00:36:37.027,"Look, I know you think emotions cloud judgment..."
00:36:37.111,00:36:42.408,"and that whole falcon story, I... I don't think I'll ever be able to wrap my head around that, but..."
00:36:45.203,00:36:48.581,all of that contradicts the first rule of being mundane.
00:36:49.999,00:36:52.252,What's the first rule of being mundane?
00:36:53.085,00:36:55.255,It's that love makes you stronger.
00:36:57.047,00:37:01.427,It was my mother's love for me that made her betray Valentine and steal the Cup.
00:37:03.513,00:37:07.016,It's love that makes you fight harder for what you want.
00:37:19.779,00:37:20.905,It's happening.
00:37:43.886,00:37:45.971,"Simon, it's me. It's... it's Clary."
00:37:52.978,00:37:55.731,"Once reborn, you emerge hungry."
00:38:06.659,00:38:07.827,Drink up.
00:38:22.049,00:38:23.384,Nephilim.
00:38:28.556,00:38:31.684,Why would you have angel blood?
00:38:41.694,00:38:42.862,"Oh, my God."
00:40:13.703,00:40:16.121,"Oh, my God! Alec, are you okay?"
00:40:26.924,00:40:27.967,Clary...
00:40:33.138,00:40:36.559,"You, um... you died."
00:40:37.184,00:40:38.936,I what?
00:40:41.313,00:40:42.648,That's blood!
00:40:45.943,00:40:56.328,"Oh, my-- It'll take time to regain the ability."
00:40:57.162,00:40:58.456,There's a lot you will need to learn.
00:41:01.501,00:41:02.710,Damn it!
00:41:08.340,00:41:09.592,Am I a vampire?
00:41:11.343,00:41:12.762,Yeah.
00:41:16.641,00:41:17.933,Tell me this is not really happening!
00:41:18.017,00:41:20.019,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!"
00:41:20.102,00:41:21.812,I'm...
00:41:25.190,00:41:27.026,"please don't say that, okay?"
00:41:29.236,00:41:32.156,You're the same Simon I've known my whole life.
00:41:35.493,00:41:39.329,And who can recite every line from... from every Nicolas Cage movie.
00:41:43.626,00:41:44.794,"when I lost my shoe, okay?"
00:41:44.877,00:41:46.336,"No, Clary, I'm not!"
00:41:50.591,00:41:51.842,I'm not.
00:41:53.678,00:41:55.387,I'm nothing more than a monster.
00:41:55.470,00:41:59.183,"No, Simon, you-- Stay away! Please just..."
00:42:00.017,00:42:01.226,stay away.
00:42:02.019,00:42:03.353,Simon...
00:42:11.571,00:42:12.780,You have my word.
00:42:17.492,00:42:18.619,What did I do?
00:00:12.595,00:00:15.390,Got a lot of stuff to work on here. Like controlling my murderous tendencies.
00:00:19.644,00:00:21.020,-Internal affairs. -Look familiar?
00:00:21.104,00:00:23.148,"Meliorn, the Clave has ordered that you be placed under arrest."
00:00:23.231,00:00:25.358,"We rule with our heads, not with our hearts."
00:00:25.442,00:00:27.402,"-I'm in. -Please, just let Meliorn go."
00:00:27.485,00:00:30.030,"You couldn't possibly understand-- It's you that doesn't understand, Alec."
00:00:31.989,00:00:33.950,-We'll fight Valentine together. -No.
00:00:35.285,00:00:37.870,I'm offering you a gift. I can help you find your father.
00:00:57.557,00:00:58.933,The remotest edges of it.
00:01:04.814,00:01:07.150,Why did we have to come here to find my father?
00:01:07.234,00:01:08.651,Because of your necklace.
00:01:09.569,00:01:10.653,It's a Portal shard.
00:01:10.737,00:01:12.029,Tell us something we don't know.
00:01:12.697,00:01:14.157,How does it work?
00:01:14.241,00:01:17.202,"When I touch the crystal and I think of someone, I can see where they are."
00:01:17.285,00:01:25.252,"I'm curious, Shadowhunter, who knows so much about Portals, did you never wonder why this Portal shard doesn't behave the way normal Portals do?"
00:01:27.670,00:01:30.632,Normal Portals can only take you to places you've been.
00:01:30.715,00:01:32.300,I guess I never really thought about it.
00:01:36.721,00:01:40.308,Your Portal shard works the way it does because it's a piece of a Portal from another dimension.
00:01:40.392,00:01:42.101,Another dimension?
00:01:42.185,00:01:46.105,You're saying there's a Portal in some other universe that can take us to anyone if we just think of them?
00:01:46.189,00:01:50.026,If you can find the only Portal still standing in that dimension...
00:01:50.110,00:01:51.278,it will take you to your father.
00:01:54.071,00:01:56.783,"Then they put Jace in, and that can't be, you know..."
00:01:56.866,00:01:58.326,"Just, hold on one second."
00:01:59.952,00:02:01.037,Where I needed to be.
00:02:01.621,00:02:03.290,Away from you and your fiancée.
00:02:03.373,00:02:05.458,Jace and Clary are on the run.
00:02:05.542,00:02:07.169,I can't protect you if you don't tell me the truth.
00:02:07.252,00:02:08.961,I don't need protecting.
00:02:09.045,00:02:12.048,Meliorn's alive. That's all that matters.
00:02:12.132,00:02:13.716,"Just... Hey, just..."
00:02:15.552,00:02:19.597,Is there any way that Raj could have seen anything incriminating?
00:02:20.932,00:02:23.393,I don't think you can call it an attack if no one got injured.
00:02:23.476,00:02:25.353,-We were ambushed. -How is that possible?
00:02:25.437,00:02:27.772,Nobody outside the Institute knew about the mission.
00:02:27.855,00:02:29.982,It was dark. We couldn't see much.
00:02:30.066,00:02:33.278,There were wolves... and the others were hit with vampires.
00:02:33.361,00:02:35.488,"But I swear, the one that got me..."
00:02:36.406,00:02:38.115,moved a lot like a Shadowhunter.
00:02:44.080,00:02:45.081,intersect the Seelie realm.
00:02:47.041,00:02:48.793,about your dimensional doorways?
00:02:48.876,00:02:50.670,They are our most guarded secret.
00:02:50.753,00:02:52.755,We are their protectors.
00:02:56.133,00:02:59.679,I owe you a life debt... and I don't like being indebted to anyone.
00:02:59.762,00:03:03.433,What would happen if-- If the Seelie Queen finds out I've shared this with you?
00:03:04.726,00:03:05.935,I could be executed.
00:03:07.812,00:03:09.772,"Well, we'll be extra careful then."
00:03:09.856,00:03:12.024,There is no we in this scenario.
00:03:12.108,00:03:15.027,Only Clary goes in to find the Portal. My debt is to her.
00:03:15.111,00:03:16.738,"You've given us no reason to trust you, Seelie."
00:03:17.864,00:03:19.156,He brought us here.
00:03:37.884,00:03:40.303,"I knew the Seelies were one with nature, but..."
00:03:49.729,00:03:53.107,What's it like? The other dimension. Is it like this one?
00:03:53.190,00:03:54.942,It is...
00:03:55.026,00:03:56.528,but it isn't.
00:03:56.611,00:03:58.112,Could you be more vague?
00:03:59.030,00:04:01.241,"It is an alternate timeline, in a sense."
00:04:01.324,00:04:05.119,"There, Shadowhunters and demons no longer exist."
00:04:05.202,00:04:09.916,-What? -And Downworlders have conformed to the mundane way of life to avoid detection.
00:04:09.999,00:04:11.208,What happened to the Shadowhunters?
00:04:11.293,00:04:15.797,"Their services were no longer required, because they won the war against the demons, centuries ago."
00:04:20.635,00:04:21.761,their culture faded away.
00:04:22.429,00:04:26.766,"Once you arrive in the alternate dimension, you will assume the body of the Clary in that world."
00:04:26.849,00:04:28.685,You will think and feel just like her.
00:04:28.768,00:04:30.895,"But I'll still know I'm me, right?"
00:04:30.978,00:04:32.730,I'll know I have to find the Portal?
00:04:34.357,00:04:35.442,There's a catch.
00:04:36.233,00:04:37.860,"With Seelies, there's always a catch."
00:04:37.944,00:04:41.197,Your alternate self could consume you if you let it.
00:04:41.281,00:04:42.657,Is there a way to not let it?
00:04:44.742,00:04:48.120,Focus on the differences between that world and ours.
00:04:48.204,00:04:51.541,Find something or someone to keep you grounded to this one.
00:04:52.459,00:04:53.460,Easy enough.
00:04:53.543,00:04:55.753,It will be more difficult than you think.
00:04:55.837,00:04:59.549,"If you don't hurry, you could cease to be this world's Clary Fairchild."
00:05:01.301,00:05:02.760,And be stuck in that world forever.
00:05:17.650,00:05:18.693,What am I supposed to do?
00:05:18.776,00:05:20.737,Just sit on my hands if Clary needs help?
00:05:20.820,00:05:22.447,Let the pack handle it.
00:05:22.530,00:05:26.909,"We can't afford to lose our leader right now, with everything that's going on with the Shadow World and Valentine."
00:05:26.993,00:05:28.578,I promised Jocelyn I'd look after her.
00:05:28.661,00:05:31.623,"When you killed Theo, you promised to take care of this pack."
00:05:41.340,00:05:42.550,There's something dead outside.
00:05:53.310,00:05:55.855,Raphael has appointed me ambassador to the werewolves.
00:05:55.938,00:05:57.524,Why the hell would you do that?
00:05:58.566,00:06:01.318,Because of my close personal connection with Luke.
00:06:05.197,00:06:06.365,Enough!
00:06:14.290,00:06:15.583,Give us a minute.
00:06:19.629,00:06:21.673,I thought me and Alaric were cool.
00:06:23.841,00:06:25.635,Then I became Nerdferatu.
00:06:28.220,00:06:29.514,"You know, I thought we were one."
00:06:29.597,00:06:31.433,"Allies, brothers in arms and all that."
00:06:32.850,00:06:34.477,"Yeah, it's not that simple."
00:06:35.227,00:06:37.146,Because vampires and werewolves hate each other?
00:06:38.397,00:06:40.399,Not all vampires and werewolves.
00:06:47.114,00:06:49.116,"So, why did you really come here?"
00:06:53.287,00:06:55.331,He got frustrated with my training and told me to take a walk.
00:06:55.414,00:06:59.544,And you decided to go to the one place where you could get torn apart by wild dogs?
00:07:00.795,00:07:01.879,Seemed like a good idea at the time.
00:07:06.884,00:07:08.761,I was ordered to bring you these.
00:07:14.391,00:07:17.854,"So, let me guess, your training stalled somewhere around here?"
00:07:18.354,00:07:19.564,Emotions running hot?
00:07:19.647,00:07:21.524,Anything and everything makes you wanna vamp out?
00:07:21.608,00:07:23.735,It's like... it's like going through puberty all over again.
00:07:23.818,00:07:25.236,Just with less zits.
00:07:25.319,00:07:28.155,Mmm. It's the same way with new werewolves.
00:07:30.533,00:07:32.744,I just need to be sure it's safe.
00:07:34.286,00:07:36.581,-Just in case I don't make it back. -You're coming back.
00:07:36.664,00:07:38.958,What do either of us know about interdimensional travel?
00:07:40.292,00:07:42.294,-Little bit. -Not helping.
00:07:44.213,00:07:45.339,It's time.
00:07:47.592,00:07:52.304,"Meliorn, I appreciate the risk you're taking, but a life debt requires you ensure my safety."
00:07:55.642,00:07:57.268,I'll agree to go alone...
00:07:57.351,00:08:01.689,"but if I find this alternate Portal, I won't be able to face Valentine on my own."
00:08:01.773,00:08:02.857,She'll need backup.
00:08:12.283,00:08:14.368,Only demons can pass through unaided.
00:08:49.361,00:08:54.033,a terrified puppy from a drain pipe in Crown Heights yesterday morning. Remy Hershel...
00:09:12.969,00:09:14.386,Is this from one of your cosplay skits?
00:09:14.470,00:09:16.180,"Uh, honey?"
00:09:16.263,00:09:17.682,Come in here. You gotta see this.
00:09:17.765,00:09:20.226,"No, seriously, you have to let me come with you, just once, okay?"
00:09:20.309,00:09:22.019,"I want to see what you do at these things, all right?"
00:09:24.396,00:09:25.857,You'd stick out like a sore thumb.
00:09:30.444,00:09:34.616,"Wow, if you miss us this much, you should really leave the dorm room more often."
00:09:53.760,00:09:55.887,in honor of your father's Mad Hatter party tonight.
00:09:57.471,00:09:59.932,Your mom made waffles for you.
00:10:01.475,00:10:03.269,"Come on, kiddo, you gotta eat somethin', right?"
00:10:06.981,00:10:08.816,"So, Clarissa..."
00:10:09.942,00:10:12.111,"when do I get to meet this new man in your life, hmm?"
00:10:12.194,00:10:13.362,Val...
00:10:13.445,00:10:14.947,What? I have to...
00:10:27.001,00:10:29.211,what I was supposed to do with my life.
00:10:41.683,00:10:43.559,So I opened up a rare bookstore.
00:10:49.774,00:10:51.400,I'm Magnus Bane.
00:10:51.483,00:10:53.903,Come in today for a tarot card and psychic reading.
00:10:53.986,00:10:56.322,I'll help you find your way.
00:11:03.245,00:11:04.538,-I have to go. -What?
00:11:04.621,00:11:05.998,I thought you were spending the morning with us.
00:11:06.082,00:11:09.376,"I, uh, have a last minute assignment due that I haven't even started yet, so..."
00:11:12.714,00:11:13.756,Clarissa?
00:11:17.093,00:11:18.886,-I'm sorry. -For what?
00:11:25.434,00:11:28.896,"Isabelle Lightwood, by order of the Clave, you are under arrest for high treason."
00:11:28.980,00:11:31.023,What? On what grounds?
00:11:33.525,00:11:35.111,And everyone knows she's sleeping with him.
00:11:39.281,00:11:42.159,"You know what, Lydia? You're no better than Valentine."
00:11:48.707,00:11:50.334,hide behind the Law.
00:11:51.377,00:11:55.131,"I don't hide behind it, Isabelle. I simply follow it."
00:11:55.214,00:11:58.134,Because it guards against one very important thing.
00:11:58.217,00:12:01.053,Shadowhunters fighting other Shadowhunters.
00:12:05.391,00:12:07.059,-I can't let that-- -Don't.
00:12:08.936,00:12:10.062,It's not your fight.
00:12:21.323,00:12:22.491,"We've been texting you for, like, 20 minutes."
00:12:22.574,00:12:24.326,"-Simon, get out of the sun. -Hey, what the hell?"
00:12:29.040,00:12:30.082,Caffeine deprivation.
00:12:30.833,00:12:32.168,"Come on, Tweek."
00:12:32.251,00:12:34.086,"Simon, I do not have time for coffee today."
00:12:34.170,00:12:35.421,"No, no, no. I know that look in your eye."
00:12:35.504,00:12:39.967,"And when you get that look, I either have to caffeinate you immediately or accept full responsibility for you killing someone."
00:12:44.763,00:12:45.807,Is that new?
00:12:47.058,00:12:50.812,"-Yes, I got it a couple days ago. -Oh, it goes with your dress?"
00:12:50.895,00:12:53.480,"Because you're getting ready at my place tonight, right?"
00:12:53.564,00:12:55.399,Ready for what?
00:12:55.482,00:12:57.151,That is not even a little bit funny.
00:12:57.234,00:13:03.908,I have poured my heart and soul into planning this anniversary party for the Institute. And the theme is amazing.
00:13:03.991,00:13:05.367,Mmm.
00:13:06.702,00:13:07.744,This one's for Clary.
00:13:07.829,00:13:09.038,She's here?
00:13:10.039,00:13:11.833,"But, seriously, what is with this guy and the Mad Hatter?"
00:13:12.875,00:13:14.626,Visionaries are quirky crazy.
00:13:14.710,00:13:17.213,You don't get 4D Internet tech thinking inside the box.
00:13:17.296,00:13:19.506,I'm beginning to wonder if you don't have a thing for your boss.
00:13:20.757,00:13:22.927,"Like, if Clary's dad would ever go for me."
00:13:25.096,00:13:26.305,"No, I'm totally kidding."
00:13:28.349,00:13:29.976,"-No. -Right, of course not."
00:13:30.059,00:13:32.519,-That'd be totally weird. -Yeah. Mmm-hmm.
00:13:34.021,00:13:35.272,-Order's up. -Hi.
00:13:35.356,00:13:36.440,"We're setting up at 6:00, right?"
00:13:37.441,00:13:40.152,"Yeah, okay. I need your help tonight... loading."
00:13:40.236,00:13:42.613,This gig could be... huge for me.
00:13:44.991,00:13:46.033,You wanna get out of here?
00:13:46.117,00:13:47.743,Sure.
00:14:03.134,00:14:04.426,Just shut up and kiss me.
00:14:24.030,00:14:25.072,Clary.
00:14:26.908,00:14:29.285,It's funny how similar werewolves and vampires are.
00:14:29.368,00:14:31.412,Makes you wonder why we can't get along.
00:14:32.663,00:14:36.250,"So, Clary getting us to fight together was-- It was practically a miracle."
00:14:36.333,00:14:38.294,It says a lot about who she could be as a leader.
00:14:38.377,00:14:39.461,She's got moxie.
00:14:39.545,00:14:41.047,She'll be all right.
00:14:41.130,00:14:42.173,Because she's with Jace?
00:14:42.256,00:14:43.465,No.
00:14:43.549,00:14:45.885,Because she's a fighter. Like her mom.
00:14:45.968,00:14:48.304,She'll fight her way back to us if she has to.
00:14:48.387,00:14:51.223,"Well, not that this Downworlder thing isn't fun..."
00:14:53.976,00:14:55.144,I just wanna go home.
00:14:56.312,00:14:57.354,You can't.
00:14:57.438,00:15:00.691,Not until you control your impulses. You understand me?
00:15:01.817,00:15:03.194,-Just keep practicing. -Okay.
00:15:05.696,00:15:07.281,Here we go. Okay.
00:15:08.950,00:15:10.367,Shut up!
00:15:14.621,00:15:15.664,That's it.
00:15:17.083,00:15:19.210,"You didn't think you could hide forever, did you, Garroway?"
00:15:19.293,00:15:20.336,I figured I'd try.
00:15:20.419,00:15:22.463,"We'll put this one down as an epic fail, then."
00:15:40.772,00:15:42.858,I was ready to rip his throat out.
00:15:42.942,00:15:44.735,How'd you stop me?
00:15:44.818,00:15:45.902,Wolf reflexes.
00:15:46.820,00:15:48.530,Who the hell is this guy?
00:15:48.614,00:15:50.032,Internal affairs.
00:15:50.116,00:15:53.869,Thinks I killed my captain and a couple other people connected to the demonic murders.
00:15:54.870,00:15:56.372,-Did you? -Only one.
00:15:58.457,00:15:59.875,Protecting Clary from the Circle.
00:15:59.959,00:16:01.961,Oh. Enough said.
00:16:02.044,00:16:03.170,"So, what now?"
00:16:05.922,00:16:09.510,"If Clary doesn't make it out of there soon, you're gonna be meditating six feet under."
00:16:10.552,00:16:13.305,"Shadowhunter, have you ever seen a Seelie knight fight?"
00:16:14.473,00:16:18.019,I wouldn't be so cocky about your prowess if I were you.
00:16:22.689,00:16:23.940,What's going on?
00:16:26.818,00:16:30.031,Opening the doorway to this dimension may not have been a good idea.
00:16:30.114,00:16:33.367,"On a scale from one to namaste, how screwed are we?"
00:16:34.451,00:16:36.996,Demons are attracted to this dimension.
00:16:37.079,00:16:39.665,It's defenseless and peaceful.
00:16:39.748,00:16:41.750,They like chaos and havoc.
00:16:43.252,00:16:45.837,"All right, pointy ears, looks like yoga time might be over."
00:16:53.470,00:16:56.140,You are in a loving relationship.
00:16:58.142,00:17:00.311,This man has a strong hold on you.
00:17:01.020,00:17:04.815,You feel a magnetic attraction to him that you cannot escape.
00:17:05.732,00:17:08.485,Tonight will define your relationship.
00:17:11.780,00:17:13.782,You hope he is your soul mate.
00:17:16.868,00:17:21.665,But secrets revealed will threaten to tear you apart.
00:17:30.966,00:17:31.967,I have two.
00:17:39.850,00:17:41.185,I'm not actually here for a reading.
00:17:42.519,00:17:44.105,"I know you're a warlock, Magnus."
00:17:47.524,00:17:48.859,I'm a Shadowhunter.
00:17:53.822,00:17:55.574,There are no more Shadowhunters.
00:17:55.657,00:17:56.992,Haven't been for hundreds of years.
00:17:57.076,00:17:58.327,I can prove it.
00:18:01.163,00:18:02.831,"All I see, Shadowhunter..."
00:18:03.749,00:18:05.459,is you could use a serious tan.
00:18:15.051,00:18:16.553,I'm from an alternate reality.
00:18:17.513,00:18:18.972,If that were true...
00:18:19.890,00:18:22.058,"without an anchor, you'd be assimilating into this world."
00:18:25.437,00:18:27.689,Which is part of why I need your help.
00:18:36.532,00:18:38.992,I need your magic to help me stop it.
00:18:41.995,00:18:43.122,I can't help you.
00:18:44.039,00:18:45.957,My magic's gone dormant.
00:18:46.833,00:18:48.084,Then wake it up.
00:18:59.388,00:19:01.515,Lydia... can we talk?
00:19:05.769,00:19:07.771,-What? No. -Why wouldn't you?
00:19:10.441,00:19:11.858,Head of Institute hat off?
00:19:11.942,00:19:13.194,Yeah.
00:19:15.987,00:19:20.242,"Listen, I need to come clean about what happened at the City of Bones."
00:19:20.326,00:19:22.411,"Isabelle was there, wasn't she?"
00:19:22.494,00:19:25.789,Yeah... and Jace and Clary.
00:19:25.872,00:19:27.833,And some vampires and werewolves.
00:19:31.587,00:19:33.797,"Well, they weren't wrong, but I had orders."
00:19:33.880,00:19:36.258,"Yeah, and I understand that better than anyone."
00:19:36.342,00:19:38.885,But I can't let Izzy be exiled for this.
00:19:38.969,00:19:42.097,"In the eyes of the Clave, she's guilty."
00:19:45.809,00:19:48.604,I may have something that the Clave wants.
00:19:50.356,00:19:52.023,I can give them the Mortal Cup.
00:19:53.609,00:19:55.402,"Alec, you have it?"
00:19:55.486,00:19:57.238,Why didn't you tell me before?
00:19:58.989,00:20:03.827,And there's this thing with Clary-- It's... I get it. He's your parabatai.
00:20:03.910,00:20:05.996,I'm gonna trade the Cup for Izzy's freedom.
00:20:06.079,00:20:07.289,Do you think the Clave would go for it?
00:20:07.373,00:20:10.376,"To keep it out of Valentine's hands, they'll do anything."
00:20:10.459,00:20:11.460,Where is it?
00:20:31.688,00:20:32.856,Jace.
00:20:51.166,00:20:52.334,What does that do?
00:20:55.128,00:20:56.963,Hopefully...
00:20:57.047,00:20:58.214,kick-start my magic.
00:21:00.801,00:21:02.010,Give it a minute?
00:21:07.641,00:21:09.476,That book is very precious.
00:21:10.894,00:21:13.229,Warlock spells preserved in all their grandeur.
00:21:16.858,00:21:17.901,This isn't working.
00:21:17.984,00:21:19.403,This is the longest I've ever abstained.
00:21:22.739,00:21:24.450,Why don't you just try something simple?
00:21:25.367,00:21:26.410,Move that.
00:21:36.002,00:21:38.046,"Usually, you have a little bit more of a..."
00:21:39.130,00:21:40.591,flourish to it.
00:21:41.174,00:21:42.217,I do not look like that.
00:21:43.176,00:21:44.553,Well...
00:21:53.812,00:21:55.522,"Magnus, we just have to find the Portal."
00:21:55.606,00:21:59.818,"Even if my magic was working, I'd still need an energy signature of some kind to track it."
00:21:59.901,00:22:01.570,Maybe we try something different.
00:22:01.653,00:22:04.531,I don't know how this came into this dimension with me.
00:22:04.615,00:22:06.325,Because it's of this dimension.
00:22:07.242,00:22:08.327,It belongs here.
00:22:11.997,00:22:13.707,Oh. Now that's what I'm talking about.
00:22:13.790,00:22:15.000,We have lift off.
00:22:17.919,00:22:20.046,The energy is very faint.
00:22:20.130,00:22:23.299,It's been dormant for a long time. Like me.
00:22:30.474,00:22:34.603,Yes. It's in a subbasement of...
00:22:35.353,00:22:36.354,Fort Knox.
00:22:36.438,00:22:41.234,"Like, literally Fort-- No, but it might as well be. The Institute."
00:22:41.818,00:22:42.819,Why is that a problem?
00:22:42.903,00:22:45.531,"High tech, high security. Impossible to get into."
00:22:45.614,00:22:48.784,And hosting an anniversary party tonight that I have the hookup to.
00:22:54.372,00:22:57.584,Meet me tonight at 7:00 p.m. at the Institute.
00:22:59.127,00:23:00.128,Dress to impress.
00:23:12.641,00:23:13.809,Jace stole the Cup.
00:23:17.688,00:23:19.022,"Izzy, did you know about this?"
00:23:19.940,00:23:21.608,"My God, did you help him?"
00:23:22.776,00:23:24.778,The Cup is the only thing that can get you out of this.
00:23:24.861,00:23:26.447,Jace is doing what he thinks is right.
00:23:26.530,00:23:27.864,What's right?
00:23:28.574,00:23:30.325,He put the whole Shadow World in danger.
00:23:30.408,00:23:33.328,He put you in danger. We have to get him back here.
00:23:33.411,00:23:35.914,With the Cup. It's the only thing that can help you.
00:23:35.997,00:23:38.542,They've taken Meliorn back to the Seelie realm.
00:23:38.625,00:23:39.960,You can't track him there.
00:23:40.752,00:23:42.295,Not by any of the normal ways.
00:23:44.130,00:23:46.007,"No, absolutely not."
00:23:46.091,00:23:48.176,You cannot track Jace through your parabatai bond.
00:23:48.259,00:23:49.970,It will weaken both of you.
00:23:50.971,00:23:51.972,Or break the bond.
00:23:52.055,00:23:53.849,Jace already weakened it.
00:23:53.932,00:23:55.517,How does he think I can trust him after what he did?
00:23:55.601,00:23:57.227,"Don't say that. Please, Alec."
00:23:57.894,00:23:59.437,Think about what you're doing.
00:24:17.498,00:24:18.707,You're awake.
00:24:25.046,00:24:27.257,I would hate to start this with you...
00:24:28.466,00:24:29.676,completely out of it.
00:24:33.639,00:24:35.682,The perfect little siphoning tool.
00:24:37.893,00:24:39.019,You wanna see how it works?
00:24:39.102,00:24:40.687,-No. -Don't be shy.
00:24:40.771,00:24:43.314,You'll be fine. It only hurts a little bit.
00:24:43.398,00:24:44.608,Until I die.
00:24:44.691,00:24:45.692,Yeah.
00:24:46.610,00:24:50.071,That is one of the side effects of extracting all of the blood from the human body.
00:24:51.406,00:24:52.658,You're the demonic killer.
00:24:52.741,00:24:55.493,"You know, I don't... I don't like that title."
00:24:57.078,00:24:58.163,It makes me angry.
00:25:01.917,00:25:04.002,Let's get you hooked up to this thing.
00:25:04.085,00:25:06.379,"Please, no. No. Hey, please."
00:25:06.462,00:25:07.463,"Please, don't."
00:25:13.554,00:25:15.138,No! No!
00:25:15.221,00:25:16.222,Help me!
00:25:16.932,00:25:17.974,Help me!
00:25:20.060,00:25:22.520,-Stop. -No! No! No!
00:25:25.481,00:25:27.400,-God... No! No! -Stay still.
00:25:27.483,00:25:28.610,Somebody help me!
00:25:43.249,00:25:44.500,I told you it wasn't me.
00:25:48.379,00:25:49.631,What's the emergency?
00:25:51.842,00:25:54.469,"Kickboxing class. I thought, Why not? Quick class after work."
00:25:55.971,00:25:57.347,"Well, you got the boom part right."
00:25:57.430,00:25:59.015,Andrea's foot right into my face.
00:25:59.099,00:26:01.309,She has to pick today to finally land her roundhouse?
00:26:01.392,00:26:03.269,"-It's... It's okay. We'll fix it. -Oh, my God."
00:26:03.353,00:26:04.354,What are people gonna think?
00:26:04.437,00:26:08.066,And then Alec worked so hard to plan this. I just cannot not go to the party.
00:26:08.149,00:26:09.192,-And what am I supposed to do? -Hey.
00:26:09.275,00:26:11.444,"-I worked so hard. -Hey, we're gonna fix it."
00:26:11.527,00:26:12.654,Okay.
00:26:14.155,00:26:18.201,"But then we have to fix you and Jace, because the two of you not talking really messes with my chi."
00:26:21.121,00:26:22.122,We will make it work.
00:26:22.205,00:26:25.876,"Okay, because if I don't show up to the party, your dad and Simon are so gonna kill me."
00:26:26.752,00:26:27.794,"So, um..."
00:26:27.878,00:26:30.756,do you think you could get a friend of mine on the guest list for tonight?
00:26:30.839,00:26:34.843,"Um... well, if you make this work, I'll do anything for you."
00:26:48.356,00:26:50.859,"See, I was obsessed when I was a kid."
00:26:50.942,00:26:52.986,Alice looked into the mirror and fell into another dimension.
00:26:53.069,00:26:59.242,"Well, it must have stuck with me, because, when I grew up, I looked into the Internet and realized it needed another dimension."
00:26:59.325,00:27:02.578,"And our 4D, breaking-the-speed-barrier Internet was born."
00:27:02.663,00:27:04.414,Says my talented developer.
00:27:05.623,00:27:07.542,"People said I was mad, so..."
00:27:08.209,00:27:09.961,"I owned it, hmm?"
00:27:11.462,00:27:13.006,"Thank you so much for the gig, Mr. M."
00:27:13.089,00:27:14.549,"Simon, how many times do I have to tell you?"
00:27:16.802,00:27:19.470,Yes! Is Blackwell is gonna be there? 'Cause that guy is a sore loser.
00:27:19.554,00:27:21.597,"Yeah, that's 'cause you bled him dry."
00:27:23.767,00:27:26.311,"If you'll excuse me, I have some pressing matters to attend to."
00:27:35.070,00:27:36.738,-I love the hat. -I know you do.
00:27:50.210,00:27:51.211,May I?
00:27:52.462,00:27:54.630,Jace. Hi. Um...
00:27:56.174,00:27:58.343,"-Clary, what's going on with you? -Nothing."
00:28:03.932,00:28:06.226,-I'll be right back. -Val...
00:28:12.398,00:28:14.442,This must be the Jace I've heard so much about.
00:28:16.694,00:28:18.113,Sir is for my father.
00:28:18.196,00:28:20.281,Call me... Mr. Morgenstern.
00:28:27.873,00:28:30.208,"Oh, right. Nice to meet you."
00:28:30.291,00:28:33.461,"It was a pleasure to nice... Uh, nice to meet you as well."
00:28:38.383,00:28:39.509,"Uh, Clary..."
00:28:40.426,00:28:42.095,What...
00:28:42.178,00:28:43.513,What's going on with you?
00:28:51.437,00:28:53.398,"I'm sorry, okay? Really, I am."
00:28:57.652,00:28:58.820,Just one dance.
00:29:00.238,00:29:01.697,Fine. Okay.
00:29:02.448,00:29:03.950,-One. -One?
00:29:04.034,00:29:05.786,-One. -You got somewhere else to be?
00:29:55.376,00:29:58.588,"Alec, don't do this out of anger. Jace is still your parabatai."
00:29:58.671,00:29:59.798,Lydia's right.
00:29:59.881,00:30:03.468,I'm not letting Jace sacrifice my sister for his girlfriend's pointless crusade.
00:30:04.052,00:30:05.053,We're doing this.
00:30:05.136,00:30:06.554,"And if you don't want to help, get out."
00:30:07.180,00:30:10.266,-I'll help... but on one condition. -What?
00:30:10.350,00:30:11.852,You don't let it go too far.
00:30:12.477,00:30:14.855,Now your bond with Jace can withstand a certain amount of strain.
00:30:14.938,00:30:18.108,But you have to promise me that you won't let it break.
00:30:18.191,00:30:19.525,Jace is dead to me.
00:30:21.652,00:30:24.197,"how dependent you are on the bond, or how dependent you are on each other."
00:30:24.280,00:30:25.573,I have to do this.
00:30:25.656,00:30:27.117,For Izzy.
00:30:34.540,00:30:35.708,Prepare yourself.
00:30:36.792,00:30:38.378,"This will be very, very painful."
00:30:39.420,00:30:40.463,Do it.
00:30:42.798,00:30:43.799,Do you hear that?
00:30:49.722,00:30:50.723,Where the hell did you get those?
00:30:50.806,00:30:52.142,"The Earth provides, Shadowhunter."
00:31:09.993,00:31:11.202,Concentrate.
00:31:11.786,00:31:14.873,Reach out with your mind... and your heart.
00:31:16.082,00:31:21.296,"Use every strand, every fiber of you that is connected to him."
00:31:37.520,00:31:38.604,You know where he is?
00:31:49.240,00:31:51.117,"I told you, I'm on the list."
00:31:51.201,00:31:52.452,You're not here.
00:31:53.786,00:31:56.164,-What seems to be the problem? -This one wants to crash the party.
00:31:58.124,00:32:00.085,I'll be responsible for this one.
00:32:00.168,00:32:01.877,Come on in.
00:32:10.553,00:32:11.721,To us.
00:32:19.812,00:32:20.896,"Thanks, but..."
00:32:21.814,00:32:22.941,I gotta go.
00:32:24.692,00:32:27.487,Playing hard to get. I love a challenge.
00:32:31.407,00:32:33.076,-I need to borrow your lady. -Okay.
00:32:33.159,00:32:35.495,"Well, promise you'll give her back to me?"
00:32:36.329,00:32:37.538,Cross my heart and hope to die.
00:32:37.622,00:32:39.832,"Well, I'll have to trust you."
00:32:40.666,00:32:41.667,All right.
00:32:43.711,00:32:45.005,I'm gonna ask Izzy to move in with me.
00:32:45.088,00:32:46.881,"Oh, my God, Simon. She's totally gonna say yes."
00:32:48.049,00:32:49.384,"I mean, I don't know. Maybe it's a bad idea."
00:32:54.680,00:32:56.057,-The Dracula stare. -Mmm-hmm.
00:32:58.351,00:33:00.395,"-Okay, I'm good. I'm good. -All right."
00:33:01.396,00:33:03.523,"-Go get 'em, tiger. -Okay."
00:33:12.073,00:33:13.241,"Come on, let's go."
00:33:14.200,00:33:15.826,Who are you?
00:33:19.705,00:33:21.749,"Clary, it's me, Magnus."
00:33:23.584,00:33:25.170,Focus.
00:33:25.253,00:33:26.754,"Okay, seriously, let go of me."
00:33:29.799,00:33:30.841,What is wrong with you?
00:33:41.852,00:33:43.729,-You're telling me. -This way. Let's go.
00:34:03.499,00:34:04.750,"Yeah, they're running the prints now."
00:34:04.834,00:34:07.087,Thanks for...
00:34:07.170,00:34:08.171,Just doing my job.
00:34:08.254,00:34:10.173,About that.
00:34:10.256,00:34:12.258,IA is off your back. For good.
00:34:12.342,00:34:14.219,"Hell, the mayor wants to give you a medal."
00:34:17.055,00:34:18.848,Okay.
00:34:18.931,00:34:20.015,Thanks.
00:34:30.360,00:34:31.902,So... how'd I do?
00:34:32.570,00:34:33.863,-Hmm. -What?
00:34:33.946,00:34:35.281,"You shot me, like, a gazillion times."
00:34:35.365,00:34:36.782,Shouldn't have had to.
00:34:37.533,00:34:41.287,-What's that? -Alaric's working his magic so you're not associated with the demonic murders.
00:34:41.371,00:34:44.415,You saved our Alpha. The pack's indebted to you.
00:34:44.499,00:34:47.210,"So, I'm thinking... moo shu pork for life?"
00:34:53.299,00:34:54.800,What are we even looking for?
00:34:55.718,00:34:57.095,I'll know it when I see it.
00:35:01.349,00:35:02.558,What if this doesn't work?
00:35:02.642,00:35:04.977,"It will, biscuit. I can feel it."
00:35:10.483,00:35:15.196,"You know, if you were having second thoughts about us, you could have told me, instead of coming down here and hooking up with some random guy."
00:35:15.280,00:35:17.198,"-Jace, this isn't exactly a good time. -Really?"
00:35:17.282,00:35:18.783,"You know when would be a good time for me, Clary?"
00:35:20.160,00:35:21.577,Never.
00:35:21.661,00:35:22.787,Never call me again.
00:35:28.668,00:35:29.960,Let's go.
00:35:41.096,00:35:42.140,Did you kill it?
00:35:42.848,00:35:43.891,No.
00:35:46.144,00:35:47.228,It went through?
00:35:53.943,00:35:55.778,I have to shut the entrance.
00:35:55.861,00:35:57.112,More demons are coming.
00:35:57.197,00:35:58.239,What about Clary?
00:35:58.323,00:36:00.074,You said you Seelies protect other dimensions.
00:36:00.158,00:36:01.159,We do.
00:36:06.247,00:36:10.460,"-I can kill it. -If I seal the doorway behind you-- I know, the Portal is the only way out."
00:36:11.211,00:36:13.963,I'm willing to take that risk. Grant me entry.
00:36:15.673,00:36:18.259,"Remember, you won't have your seraph blade."
00:36:18.343,00:36:21.221,Demons don't disintegrate in this dimension.
00:36:24.974,00:36:26.016,Go.
00:36:46.161,00:36:47.205,Jace?
00:36:47.288,00:36:48.498,Yeah.
00:36:57.172,00:36:58.424,What was that?
00:37:01.219,00:37:03.346,"But if they're in there, they're not coming out."
00:37:05.431,00:37:06.641,Mind filling me in?
00:37:38.381,00:37:40.758,"Jace, it's okay, it's okay. Breathe."
00:37:51.977,00:37:53.062,Where's my stele?
00:37:53.145,00:37:54.439,It didn't come through with you.
00:37:55.606,00:37:57.275,You're gonna need more than a stele for that.
00:37:57.358,00:37:58.943,Will Portaling him back to his own body cure him?
00:37:59.026,00:38:01.487,No. Blood travels with you.
00:38:01.571,00:38:03.614,It's why your angelic powers still work here.
00:38:03.698,00:38:04.824,The demon venom is in his blood.
00:38:04.907,00:38:07.452,Then we have to get him back to the Institute in our dimension.
00:38:12.332,00:38:15.710,"We might not get another chance, Clary. This is too important."
00:38:16.877,00:38:18.087,Come on.
00:38:23.343,00:38:24.385,Magnus.
00:38:41.611,00:38:42.612,Why?
00:38:42.695,00:38:45.197,To secure your dimension from all sides.
00:38:45.280,00:38:50.661,"Otherwise, if it stays open, you'll be vulnerable to demon attacks again."
00:38:50.745,00:38:52.162,I'll take care of it...
00:38:52.246,00:38:54.415,and the malodorous monstrosity on that table.
00:38:57.377,00:38:59.670,"-Thank you. -Well, I should be thanking you."
00:38:59.754,00:39:03.966,No... you gave me back a life. I won't forget it.
00:39:04.049,00:39:05.593,"Now, go."
00:39:07.928,00:39:09.013,Think of your father.
00:39:26.697,00:39:27.948,What happened?
00:39:28.032,00:39:29.074,Are you and Jace okay?
00:39:29.158,00:39:30.200,No.
00:39:32.077,00:39:34.038,"Our parabatai bond, it's just..."
00:39:35.039,00:39:36.206,so weak.
00:39:37.291,00:39:38.418,He's like a ghost.
00:39:39.084,00:39:40.836,"Alec, what did you do?"
00:39:42.797,00:39:46.091,Lydia and I thought we could stop the trial if we gave the Cup to the Clave.
00:39:46.175,00:39:47.342,Lydia helped you?
00:39:48.093,00:39:49.344,It doesn't matter.
00:39:56.644,00:39:59.021,She has no choice but to go through with the trial now.
00:40:10.324,00:40:13.828,"It's okay, big brother. I know you tried."
00:40:18.874,00:40:20.000,I'm sorry.
00:40:30.636,00:40:31.721,Jace.
00:40:31.804,00:40:33.097,Okay.
00:40:35.600,00:40:37.977,"It's okay. It's okay. I'm here, it's okay."
00:40:38.060,00:40:39.520,No going back now.
00:40:49.780,00:40:52.074,Magnus was right. It's not working.
00:41:11.093,00:41:12.512,What is all this?
00:41:16.390,00:41:17.850,The makings of an army.
00:41:20.352,00:41:21.479,There's no one here.
00:41:21.562,00:41:23.397,Did Meliorn lie to us?
00:41:23.481,00:41:25.775,He said that that Portal would take us to my father.
00:41:51.884,00:41:53.427,It can't be.
00:41:54.637,00:41:56.221,It can't be.
00:41:56.305,00:41:58.432,You died. I saw it.
00:42:03.020,00:42:04.021,Jace?
00:42:08.984,00:42:10.695,"Jace, how do you know this man?"
00:42:13.864,00:42:15.324,He's my father.
00:00:11.928,00:00:13.805,The other dimension. Is it like this one?
00:00:15.765,00:00:17.184,Just shut up and kiss me.
00:00:18.726,00:00:20.312,you are under arrest for high treason.
00:00:20.395,00:00:23.606,"If she is convicted, she'll be stripped of her runes and banished."
00:00:27.319,00:00:29.154,"Our parabatai bond, it's so weak."
00:00:30.447,00:00:32.240,He said that that Portal would take us to my father.
00:00:35.993,00:00:37.329,He's my father.
00:00:43.918,00:00:45.002,Dad?
00:00:45.503,00:00:46.796,Son.
00:00:49.257,00:00:50.800,"Oh, Jace."
00:00:51.551,00:00:52.635,I can't believe it.
00:00:54.929,00:00:57.807,"Son, you're hurt. How did you find me?"
00:00:57.890,00:01:00.602,You're dead. Valentine killed you.
00:01:00.685,00:01:02.687,Valentine's... Valentine's here.
00:01:02.770,00:01:04.939,"No, Jace. It's me."
00:01:07.609,00:01:10.153,I'm Michael Wayland. I'm Jace's father.
00:01:10.237,00:01:13.740,"Look, I know what Jace told you, but I've been here for ten years."
00:01:13.823,00:01:15.867,Valentine took off and left me.
00:01:17.327,00:01:19.579,He took her with him. You are?
00:01:21.706,00:01:23.833,"Meliorn, the Seelie, told me that he was here with her."
00:01:27.003,00:01:29.339,It's Ravener venom. He kept telling me he was all right.
00:01:31.841,00:01:33.009,not my father.
00:01:35.595,00:01:37.972,His stele. Where is it?
00:01:39.307,00:01:40.683,-Back pocket. -Back pocket.
00:01:43.353,00:01:44.396,What's wrong?
00:01:45.855,00:01:47.023,Ravener venom must be spreading.
00:01:47.106,00:01:49.901,We have to get him help. We... We closed the Portal.
00:01:53.696,00:01:55.698,"Hey, Jace, stay with me. Hey."
00:01:55.782,00:01:57.784,Do you remember our first demon fight?
00:02:01.371,00:02:03.540,"You were only eight, but you were so brave."
00:02:03.623,00:02:05.583,Do you remember what you said?
00:02:07.877,00:02:12.132,"And then I said, Sometimes it's as brave to live as it is to die."
00:02:13.675,00:02:15.885,-Do you remember? -I do.
00:02:18.263,00:02:19.347,It's you.
00:02:36.906,00:02:38.658,"All I know is, we gotta get you out of here."
00:02:38.741,00:02:40.493,"All right, who do we know in Idris?"
00:02:40.577,00:02:43.871,The only people who care are Mom and Dad.
00:02:43.955,00:02:45.540,But they're under suspicion themselves.
00:02:45.623,00:02:47.124,"Uh, what about Lydia?"
00:02:47.209,00:02:48.335,-Lydia? -Yeah.
00:02:50.169,00:02:51.629,She is prosecuting me.
00:02:51.713,00:02:54.090,-You said she had no choice. -She doesn't.
00:02:54.173,00:02:56.759,"Everyone has a choice, Alec."
00:02:56.843,00:02:58.470,I made mine.
00:03:00.263,00:03:02.807,Let me just get through this without losing my self-respect.
00:03:02.890,00:03:07.354,"Look, I know you don't want to believe this, but Lydia said she would help if we can give her a way to do it."
00:03:07.437,00:03:09.856,Maybe I can get her to delay the trial.
00:03:12.066,00:03:16.363,"So I can sit here, playing computer solitaire, while they find something else to blame me for?"
00:03:16.446,00:03:18.573,I'm just a scapegoat to the Clave.
00:03:18.656,00:03:20.700,They want the Cup.
00:03:22.952,00:03:27.332,"Hey, Jace and Clary-- Disappeared through a door to God knows where."
00:03:27.415,00:03:29.166,You said they're lost forever.
00:03:31.586,00:03:33.045,And so is the Cup.
00:03:36.924,00:03:38.175,What if I was wrong?
00:03:38.260,00:03:43.681,"I can't find Jace because I weakened our bond, but that doesn't mean he can't be found, or that he can't find us."
00:03:44.724,00:03:46.393,We need more time.
00:03:46.476,00:03:48.436,You're grasping at straws now?
00:03:50.187,00:03:52.274,"Izzy, listen."
00:03:53.858,00:03:55.151,I'm your big brother.
00:03:55.235,00:03:58.405,"Please, let me help you for once."
00:04:01.949,00:04:03.535,I can't eat this.
00:04:03.618,00:04:05.953,"-You are in no position to be picky. -No, I..."
00:04:06.996,00:04:09.582,I can't eat this. I can't eat at all.
00:04:09.666,00:04:12.377,"I can't just go to a restaurant, order food, and just sit there and stare at it."
00:04:12.460,00:04:14.712,You need to learn how to adapt to what's in front of you.
00:04:14.796,00:04:17.507,"On the plate, around the meat, what do you see?"
00:04:17.590,00:04:19.926,"Blood. What should I do, lick it up?"
00:04:20.885,00:04:22.387,That would be suave.
00:04:32.314,00:04:34.357,See? You're all set.
00:04:34.441,00:04:36.318,And that move is supposed to help me look normal?
00:04:37.569,00:04:39.696,"-Yeah, maybe a wine glass would be better. -Probably."
00:04:43.741,00:04:44.784,"Clary, what happened?"
00:04:46.286,00:04:48.371,"We thought we found Valentine, but he was already gone."
00:04:51.040,00:04:52.124,Michael Wayland?
00:04:52.208,00:04:54.919,"Valentine took my mother with him, but we found Jace's father."
00:04:55.002,00:04:56.921,What? I thought Valentine killed Jace's father.
00:04:57.004,00:04:58.298,He tried.
00:05:04.053,00:05:05.597,I never thought I'd see anyone again.
00:05:09.767,00:05:13.855,"His runes are too weak and he needs blood, but we can't go back to the Institute."
00:05:13.938,00:05:14.981,Simon.
00:05:15.064,00:05:17.191,"Simon, there's gotta be some kind of blood at Hotel DuMort."
00:05:17.274,00:05:18.818,-Could you call Raphael? -Can you get some water?
00:05:18.901,00:05:20.152,I'll get some.
00:05:20.236,00:05:21.446,Calling won't work. We have to do this in person.
00:05:21.529,00:05:22.530,My van is in the garage.
00:05:22.614,00:05:24.907,"You drive, I'll hide under a blanket to stay out of the sun, and..."
00:05:24.991,00:05:26.493,-there's underground parking in the hotel. -Okay.
00:05:26.576,00:05:28.370,He's weaker. You gotta hurry.
00:05:28.453,00:05:30.246,"Jace, listen to me. I'm coming back."
00:05:30.330,00:05:32.332,"Please, just hang on. Please."
00:05:33.333,00:05:35.209,-Please. -Clary?
00:05:35.292,00:05:37.044,"-Simon, let's go. -Come on."
00:05:38.630,00:05:41.173,-There were rumors that... -Everybody thought they were true.
00:05:41.257,00:05:43.635,"He tried to kill me, but I survived the attack."
00:05:46.012,00:05:48.014,I never thought I'd see him again.
00:05:49.932,00:05:53.478,-How did you survive what he did to you? -Jocelyn pulled me through.
00:05:53.561,00:05:55.522,You were there. Did he hurt her?
00:05:55.605,00:05:57.857,"No, and he won't. We both know that."
00:05:57.940,00:06:00.485,"He'll never stop loving Jocelyn, even if he wanted to."
00:06:00.568,00:06:02.278,She'll be safe.
00:06:04.280,00:06:06.198,"Jace, help is coming."
00:06:07.366,00:06:09.411,We'll talk later. Be with your son.
00:06:10.453,00:06:11.954,"Hey, Jace."
00:06:13.623,00:06:15.166,I'm so sorry.
00:06:15.249,00:06:17.168,Sorry? Why?
00:06:17.251,00:06:18.545,What you saw...
00:06:18.628,00:06:20.713,What you thought Valentine did to me...
00:06:20.797,00:06:22.214,it shaped your life.
00:06:24.216,00:06:25.885,That wasn't the way it was supposed to go.
00:06:31.223,00:06:33.851,I'll succeed. I swear.
00:06:40.357,00:06:42.944,Why can't we just take what we need and leave?
00:06:43.027,00:06:44.862,"If we were transfusing goat blood, no problem."
00:06:44.946,00:06:46.823,"But human blood, that's against the Accords."
00:06:47.615,00:06:49.158,I'm surprised you know that much.
00:06:55.498,00:06:56.541,Clary...
00:06:56.624,00:06:58.417,you really have to stop barging in here.
00:06:58.501,00:06:59.836,"Sorry, Raphael."
00:07:00.837,00:07:02.839,-We need blood. -So I've heard.
00:07:02.922,00:07:04.924,Human blood.
00:07:10.763,00:07:12.599,No can do.
00:07:12.682,00:07:14.183,"Okay, listen. Come on."
00:07:17.394,00:07:18.813,"Last night, I bumped into Bernice."
00:07:18.896,00:07:20.064,Mmm.
00:07:22.859,00:07:24.777,"You said Camille took a leave of absence, right?"
00:07:24.861,00:07:26.237,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah. They didn't care about that."
00:07:29.240,00:07:31.659,"Apparently, she'd feed on them, but never went all the way."
00:07:31.743,00:07:33.911,"What are they called? Uh, sub... submissives?"
00:07:33.995,00:07:35.830,Keep your voice down.
00:07:38.332,00:07:41.168,They're called subjugates. Horrible things.
00:07:41.252,00:07:42.962,Even Camille got sick of them.
00:07:43.045,00:07:44.756,"Okay, so, they're gone."
00:07:51.053,00:07:52.472,Camille had a taste for the real stuff.
00:07:52.555,00:07:54.223,I know from experience.
00:07:54.306,00:07:55.767,She had to have something on ice.
00:07:55.850,00:07:57.519,I'm sorry.
00:07:57.602,00:08:00.772,"If you want to tattle to the Clave about Camille draining humans, fine."
00:08:00.855,00:08:03.232,-I'm the new administration. -Yeah.
00:08:03.315,00:08:08.946,"You could probably get over on them with that line, but you weren't exactly an innocent bystander in my case."
00:08:09.030,00:08:10.948,We agreed not to discuss that.
00:08:15.953,00:08:18.873,You can't. I'd be implicated.
00:08:18.956,00:08:20.124,Then help us.
00:08:23.169,00:08:25.087,"Raphael, Jace will die without it."
00:08:27.632,00:08:28.925,Blackmail.
00:08:29.842,00:08:32.178,Save it. You're getting off easy.
00:08:50.487,00:08:51.864,What's his blood type?
00:09:07.839,00:09:10.132,"Thank you. Simon, let's go."
00:09:10.216,00:09:12.594,"Yeah, not so fast."
00:09:12.677,00:09:16.598,I like the way you handled yourself in this negotiation. Stick around.
00:09:16.681,00:09:19.934,I'm ambassador to the werewolves. It's very time-consuming.
00:09:20.017,00:09:21.894,Let me take that burden off of your shoulders.
00:09:21.978,00:09:24.438,"As of now, you've been recalled."
00:09:24.521,00:09:27.149,You're advisor to the interim chapter president.
00:09:29.652,00:09:32.446,My new advisor has to stay here.
00:09:33.239,00:09:35.992,It's okay. Just go. Really.
00:09:36.075,00:09:37.534,Thank you.
00:09:39.203,00:09:40.622,Both of you.
00:09:45.668,00:09:49.130,"The message said, Have everything ready. The trial will begin immediately."
00:09:49.213,00:09:50.715,She's on her way.
00:09:50.798,00:09:52.133,"Yeah, but that doesn't make any sense."
00:09:52.216,00:09:53.676,Why rush this?
00:09:53.760,00:09:55.637,We both know that Clary and Jace are still out there.
00:09:55.720,00:09:58.430,Clary and Jace aren't on trial for high treason.
00:09:58.514,00:09:59.849,"Oh, come on."
00:09:59.932,00:10:01.768,We both know there's nothing solid to pin on Isabelle.
00:10:23.414,00:10:24.874,Excuse us.
00:10:30.379,00:10:33.675,I understand you've cooked up some kind of a marriage with...
00:10:34.466,00:10:36.761,I can't imagine what's in your mind.
00:10:36.844,00:10:39.055,It's a suitable marriage for both of us.
00:10:39.639,00:10:41.974,"Well, I won't dispute that right now."
00:10:42.058,00:10:45.561,As long as it doesn't interfere with your case against his sister.
00:10:45.645,00:10:47.104,You have my assurance.
00:10:47.188,00:10:50.692,"I need your word, Branwell, not flaccid reassurance."
00:10:50.775,00:10:55.362,What we are seeing is the same pattern Valentine showed before the Uprising.
00:10:55.446,00:10:59.701,"Bending of the Law, wanton defiance of Clave order."
00:10:59.784,00:11:03.871,"Ma'am, I don't honestly believe Valentine was involved in the Seelie escape."
00:11:03.955,00:11:05.790,Spare me your honest belief.
00:11:06.332,00:11:07.959,Everything's out of control.
00:11:08.042,00:11:10.044,We were fools to believe Valentine was dead.
00:11:10.127,00:11:12.839,"Now his daughter has the Cup, and he's out there somewhere."
00:11:12.922,00:11:14.716,"-I won't have it. -I'm sorry, Inquisitor."
00:11:16.926,00:11:18.510,Just do your job.
00:11:18.594,00:11:21.973,"Be efficient, be competent, be useful to the Clave."
00:11:23.557,00:11:24.726,We'll begin this evening.
00:11:29.480,00:11:31.440,The transfusion helped. He's much better.
00:11:32.191,00:11:33.234,He's gonna wanna see you.
00:11:34.026,00:11:36.988,"But, uh, can I, um, talk to you for a minute?"
00:11:37.696,00:11:39.031,Of course.
00:11:42.076,00:11:44.996,I'm... I feel as if I know you.
00:11:48.124,00:11:51.085,"You're fearless, and loving, and you got a mind of your own."
00:11:52.128,00:11:54.213,"A little stubborn, perhaps?"
00:11:55.381,00:11:57.925,-I should probably work on that. -Maybe not.
00:11:58.009,00:11:59.468,It served Jocelyn well.
00:11:59.551,00:12:03.848,She hid you from Valentine long enough for you to grow up without him poisoning your mind.
00:12:03.931,00:12:06.642,It was complicated... the way I grew up.
00:12:06.725,00:12:10.229,"But I know she loved me, whatever else."
00:12:10.312,00:12:12.439,There was no whatever else for her.
00:12:13.816,00:12:16.819,I knew she was carrying you when she fled from Valentine.
00:12:16.903,00:12:18.404,But I never told him...
00:12:18.487,00:12:20.572,no matter how much he tormented me.
00:12:24.076,00:12:27.371,Valentine thought my mother was dead. Why would he ask about her?
00:12:27.454,00:12:29.706,Because he never gave up hope.
00:12:31.417,00:12:33.836,Would it help if you knew how much he loved her?
00:12:33.920,00:12:35.880,And he would have loved you too.
00:12:37.756,00:12:39.216,He's fierce in his love.
00:12:39.300,00:12:40.927,Because he was so twisted.
00:12:41.010,00:12:42.303,He's a mass murderer.
00:12:45.472,00:12:49.310,"Clary, I swear, I will help you find your mother."
00:12:49.393,00:12:52.438,I saw and heard a great deal while I was a prisoner.
00:12:52.521,00:12:54.481,Maybe that's my destiny.
00:12:55.524,00:12:57.359,To bring your family and mine together.
00:13:00.071,00:13:01.405,Go see Jace.
00:13:11.665,00:13:13.209,-Hey. -Hey.
00:13:16.628,00:13:18.255,You're looking much better.
00:13:18.339,00:13:20.799,"Yeah, uh... fresh blood."
00:13:21.800,00:13:23.302,These vamps may be on to something.
00:13:25.847,00:13:28.515,"I, uh... I just talked to your father."
00:13:29.391,00:13:31.936,"-Yeah? -Yeah, uh..."
00:13:34.813,00:13:36.941,"I don't know, it's hard to explain."
00:13:39.193,00:13:44.323,Do you remember that story you once told me about the boy who trained the falcon with kindness?
00:13:46.408,00:13:48.035,"That was you, wasn't it?"
00:13:50.121,00:13:52.123,He broke your falcon's neck.
00:13:52.957,00:13:55.042,I ruined it.
00:13:55.126,00:13:58.420,It wanted to be fed. It wouldn't hunt.
00:13:59.130,00:14:00.839,But he must have known it would hurt you.
00:14:02.174,00:14:04.051,He's so loving now. Why would he do that?
00:14:04.135,00:14:06.178,"We're not mundanes, Clary."
00:14:06.262,00:14:09.265,He had a lesson to teach me. That's how it's done.
00:14:13.394,00:14:17.148,"And I know this doesn't help, but I wish we found Jocelyn, too."
00:14:17.231,00:14:20.776,"Yeah, well, maybe finding your father will help lead us to Valentine."
00:14:21.777,00:14:24.446,Meliorn said so. Seelies can't lie.
00:14:24.530,00:14:26.073,Yeah.
00:14:26.157,00:14:28.825,And they take tangled paths wherever they go.
00:14:31.287,00:14:33.956,Although I think it's because they see more that way.
00:14:35.749,00:14:38.460,"When we were on our journey, I, uh..."
00:14:40.004,00:14:42.673,found something I didn't even know I was looking for.
00:14:48.804,00:14:49.846,Tell me.
00:14:54.643,00:14:55.895,"I, uh..."
00:14:56.896,00:14:58.730,We said things...
00:15:00.024,00:15:01.233,Felt things...
00:15:04.070,00:15:05.612,Was that me?
00:15:06.738,00:15:08.991,Was it... was it you? Was it...
00:15:10.451,00:15:11.868,was it even real?
00:15:19.543,00:15:21.295,"This is real, Clary."
00:15:24.381,00:15:26.425,This is you...
00:15:26.508,00:15:28.094,and me.
00:15:28.177,00:15:29.636,Here and now.
00:15:56.538,00:15:59.458,But why would Valentine tell a prisoner what he was planning to do?
00:15:59.541,00:16:01.668,"He didn't. Well, not directly."
00:16:02.669,00:16:04.546,But he gave me a way to learn all about his plans.
00:16:04.630,00:16:06.173,How do you mean?
00:16:12.554,00:16:15.807,The pain was excruciating. Sometimes I was sick for days.
00:16:15.891,00:16:19.186,But it's not often you got a Shadowhunter to experiment on.
00:16:19.270,00:16:22.731,So I guess that's why he always stopped short of killing me.
00:16:22.814,00:16:25.234,"But, little by little..."
00:16:25.317,00:16:27.944,I developed enhanced hearing and vision.
00:16:30.990,00:16:33.993,it's only a matter of time before more dangerous enemies turn up.
00:16:34.076,00:16:37.954,So we need to make a move against the New York Institute now.
00:16:38.039,00:16:41.833,"See, I don't need more than one Forsaken to breach the wards."
00:16:41.917,00:16:44.295,The Clave will throw everything it has at you.
00:16:44.378,00:16:46.713,So I need a base of operation closer to the Institute.
00:16:46.797,00:16:50.967,They will look everywhere except right under their noses.
00:16:51.052,00:16:53.054,What about Renwick's?
00:16:54.305,00:16:55.514,Who's Renwick?
00:16:55.597,00:16:58.309,It's not a who. It's a where.
00:17:04.523,00:17:06.108,And we can't track over water.
00:17:08.777,00:17:10.654,Valentine never wasted time on compassion.
00:17:15.492,00:17:18.370,Waiting a day could mean the difference between failure and success.
00:17:20.247,00:17:21.832,Clary and I will scout Renwick's tonight.
00:17:21.915,00:17:23.959,"Jace, don't."
00:17:24.043,00:17:25.669,Your runes are still weak. Luke and I will go.
00:17:28.339,00:17:30.632,"Jace, please."
00:17:41.268,00:17:42.728,You know what?
00:17:42.811,00:17:45.647,I'd rather be stripped of my runes and sent into exile...
00:17:45.731,00:17:47.358,than be part of this world.
00:17:47.441,00:17:50.402,What kind of people sacrifice justice for law?
00:17:52.154,00:17:57.909,But the high road's not gonna look so great when you're running for your life from a pack of demons with no Shadowhunter powers to protect you.
00:17:58.744,00:18:00.036,Jocelyn lived as a mundane.
00:18:00.121,00:18:03.290,You know Jocelyn had her runes and her weapons.
00:18:03.374,00:18:05.292,You think the demons won't find you?
00:18:12.799,00:18:14.635,You need an advocate.
00:18:19.140,00:18:20.849,I need to ask you something.
00:18:20.932,00:18:22.684,Hmm. Will it take long?
00:18:22.768,00:18:26.522,"I have a life to live, and there's not much for us to talk about."
00:18:27.398,00:18:28.774,"It's not about me, or..."
00:18:29.233,00:18:30.526,any of that.
00:18:30.609,00:18:32.027,This is about my sister.
00:18:32.111,00:18:34.070,"Oh, I see."
00:18:34.780,00:18:39.618,Are you referring to the fact that your adorable fiancée has Isabelle on trial for treason?
00:18:46.500,00:18:48.460,My sister wants you to be her defense attorney.
00:18:48.544,00:18:50.171,I said I would ask.
00:18:50.254,00:18:51.922,But I'm sorry to bother you. I know...
00:18:52.005,00:18:54.508,a Downworlder can't defend a Shadowhunter in court.
00:18:54.591,00:18:58.137,But a Shadowhunter accused of a crime can choose any advocate.
00:18:58.220,00:19:00.556,That can't mean a Downworlder.
00:19:00.639,00:19:08.980,The Clave was so rigid and prejudiced back in what they call the Time of Angels that they didn't dream of a Shadowhunter asking a Downworlder for help.
00:19:09.064,00:19:10.899,They didn't even bother to exclude us.
00:19:10.982,00:19:14.736,"So, since, as you all say..."
00:19:17.448,00:19:20.992,there's no stopping me from slipping through this gaping loophole.
00:19:21.993,00:19:23.787,For the right price.
00:19:24.788,00:19:27.208,-Name it. -You.
00:19:28.667,00:19:30.752,"In fact, I'll do you pro bono."
00:19:40.387,00:19:45.934,What else tells me that your sister means enough for you to make a real sacrifice?
00:19:51.857,00:19:53.275,Your bow and quiver.
00:19:54.360,00:19:56.069,How about that?
00:20:01.242,00:20:02.284,Done.
00:20:02.368,00:20:03.660,Hmm.
00:20:15.881,00:20:19.050,What Jace's father said about you turning into a werewolf?
00:20:20.386,00:20:23.305,You told me that's what Valentine said when it happened.
00:20:23.389,00:20:25.307,It was common sentiment then.
00:20:27.058,00:20:28.810,"Something's not adding up, Luke."
00:20:28.894,00:20:31.104,How did you know Michael was dead?
00:20:33.357,00:20:37.444,"When the Lightwoods took Jace into the New York Institute, we thought Michael got hit."
00:20:43.659,00:20:45.160,Was that 19 years ago?
00:20:45.244,00:20:47.413,It was 20. Why?
00:20:48.204,00:20:49.623,Twenty.
00:20:55.337,00:20:56.380,"Luke, look."
00:21:03.136,00:21:04.388,Ahh!
00:21:18.319,00:21:19.778,Something's wrong.
00:21:19.861,00:21:24.908,"Us Shadowhunters mend quickly, but after all my time in prison, I shouldn't be able to get a shot in on you."
00:21:25.951,00:21:27.411,You're still weak.
00:21:28.287,00:21:30.331,It's my bond with Alec Lightwood.
00:21:30.414,00:21:32.333,He purposefully weakened it trying to find me...
00:21:32.416,00:21:33.959,and Clary.
00:21:34.042,00:21:35.419,Clary.
00:21:40.591,00:21:41.967,You were with Clary instead of Alec.
00:21:45.721,00:21:47.639,How does that happen?
00:21:50.183,00:21:52.394,The Clave wants it. Alec sided with the Clave.
00:21:53.645,00:21:54.896,We can't trust the Clave.
00:21:54.980,00:21:56.231,And you don't trust Alec?
00:21:56.315,00:21:58.775,So Clary means more to you.
00:21:58.859,00:22:01.945,"No, I do. I trust him. This is different."
00:22:02.028,00:22:03.364,It should be.
00:22:03.447,00:22:05.491,But I've been watching you.
00:22:05.574,00:22:08.869,When she suggested that she and Luke go to scout Renwick's...
00:22:08.952,00:22:10.704,"Well, she was right."
00:22:10.787,00:22:12.498,"You said so yourself, I needed to train."
00:22:12.581,00:22:16.418,"Nothing would have stopped the Jace I know from going on a mission, even as a child."
00:22:19.212,00:22:22.007,"I see how attached you are to her, but this kind of thing..."
00:22:22.090,00:22:24.092,doesn't always make you stronger.
00:22:25.552,00:22:28.346,"-Shadowhunters have relationships. -Yes, of course."
00:22:28.430,00:22:30.974,"When we find someone, it's for life."
00:22:32.559,00:22:36.187,"But we're also warriors, born to serve."
00:22:36.271,00:22:39.691,And some of us are meant to render greater services than others.
00:22:39.775,00:22:41.359,I thought you were one of those.
00:22:41.443,00:22:45.280,Getting involved too deeply with any woman will only weaken your resolve.
00:22:48.492,00:22:50.952,I'm saying it wasn't what I expected of you.
00:22:52.203,00:22:54.122,But seeing you two...
00:22:57.709,00:23:00.003,What kind of father would deprive his son of that happiness?
00:23:01.254,00:23:02.964,Maybe you should rest.
00:23:09.721,00:23:11.682,Will I survive if I touch it?
00:23:12.683,00:23:14.059,If you tell the truth.
00:23:18.188,00:23:21.817,do you swear to defend your client with integrity and honesty?
00:23:21.900,00:23:23.860,No argument from me on that.
00:23:32.578,00:23:33.954,My case is simple.
00:23:34.037,00:23:39.835,"It is true that Isabelle Lightwood acted against the orders of the Clave by trying to free the Seelie, Meliorn."
00:23:39.918,00:23:42.546,But she did not act against the interests of the Clave.
00:23:42.629,00:23:47.593,Preventing the forced questioning and possible death of a Seelie may have saved the Accords.
00:23:47.676,00:23:53.306,We're not here to speculate what might have happened if the defendant hadn't interfered.
00:23:53.389,00:23:58.770,You mean what might have happened if she hadn't stopped the Silent Brothers from torturing a Seelie?
00:23:58.854,00:24:01.690,I await a valid argument. Do you have one?
00:24:03.066,00:24:05.819,What you really want is the Mortal Cup.
00:24:05.902,00:24:07.112,My client doesn't have it.
00:24:12.576,00:24:14.745,-You're out of order. -No.
00:24:16.622,00:24:19.332,It's not Isabelle's fault. It's the Cup!
00:24:19.415,00:24:21.209,Put the Cup on trial!
00:24:26.339,00:24:27.716,We couldn't even count the demons.
00:24:27.799,00:24:29.760,"Yeah, but we still gotta get Jocelyn out of there."
00:24:29.843,00:24:32.220,-That would be a suicide mission. -Doesn't have to be.
00:24:32.303,00:24:34.389,I have the Cup. Demons have to obey me.
00:24:35.974,00:24:37.809,He knows you'll do anything to save your mother.
00:24:37.893,00:24:39.310,He wants you to take out the Cup and use it.
00:24:40.937,00:24:42.480,"And he'll kill us, too."
00:24:55.076,00:24:59.122,You have led us to believe that you alone carried out this operation.
00:25:00.040,00:25:03.293,But Clary Fairchild was seen near the City of Bones that night.
00:25:03.376,00:25:04.920,Maybe she was out for a walk.
00:25:05.003,00:25:10.508,"And you expect us to believe that you distracted the guards, and escaped with the prisoner on your own?"
00:25:11.509,00:25:13.762,"Pretty slick, right?"
00:25:14.930,00:25:23.271,I suggest you think about how slick it would be when Valentine uses the Mortal Cup to raise an army of rogue Shadowhunters.
00:25:23.354,00:25:26.316,I don't want Valentine to succeed.
00:25:26.399,00:25:28.318,"Well, that's the first sane thing I've heard from you."
00:25:30.070,00:25:34.532,Thinking we have the right to treat a Downworlder's life as worthless.
00:25:34.616,00:25:39.245,"Isabelle, I should warn you that everything you say here will be considered in the verdict."
00:25:42.290,00:25:44.668,Valentine didn't come out of nowhere.
00:25:44.751,00:25:49.005,"We use our angel blood to justify everything we do, just like him."
00:25:49.089,00:25:52.718,"Like him, we forget that we are not only angels."
00:25:52.801,00:25:54.761,We are part mundane.
00:25:54.845,00:25:56.387,We can be afraid.
00:25:56.471,00:25:58.181,And fear makes us cruel.
00:25:58.264,00:26:01.893,And we turn our fear to Downworlders just as Valentine did.
00:26:01.977,00:26:03.604,And just as he did...
00:26:03.687,00:26:06.607,we will end up turning on each other.
00:26:11.569,00:26:13.905,You have to answer that for yourself...
00:26:15.198,00:26:16.532,Madam Inquisitor.
00:26:22.413,00:26:24.540,There were a thousand demons here last night.
00:26:24.625,00:26:25.751,That's what he wants.
00:26:25.834,00:26:28.503,"He wants to draw us in, force Clary to use the Cup."
00:26:39.681,00:26:40.682,Watch your back!
00:27:01.452,00:27:03.496,Where are your claws?
00:27:03.579,00:27:06.291,"I don't need special powers to kill you, coward."
00:27:06.374,00:27:07.959,Don't bother with that.
00:27:08.043,00:27:10.420,It only lights up for real Shadowhunters.
00:27:10.503,00:27:13.506,Find Jocelyn. I got this.
00:27:14.841,00:27:17.260,We need to find Clary. Now.
00:28:02.806,00:28:04.224,Mom.
00:28:18.571,00:28:21.407,-Where's Luke? -We left him fighting Blackwell.
00:28:21.491,00:28:23.659,"Luke told us to leave him, Clary."
00:28:26.788,00:28:27.873,No! What are you doing? Get back!
00:28:27.956,00:28:30.541,"Jace, we cannot shut Luke out! He has to make it inside!"
00:28:30.625,00:28:33.419,"-No, Clary, there is not enough time! -We have to secure the room."
00:28:33.503,00:28:35.630,-We don't even know if Luke is still... -Alive?
00:28:35.713,00:28:37.173,"Jace, no. You have to tell him!"
00:28:37.257,00:28:40.176,We cannot shut Luke out! He will die for nothing!
00:28:41.552,00:28:43.304,Luke wants you and Jocelyn out of here.
00:28:45.015,00:28:46.307,Pull yourself together.
00:28:48.935,00:28:51.604,Do you understand? We will get her home. Look at me!
00:28:51.687,00:28:54.399,We will find a way to wake her up. Do you believe me?
00:28:55.859,00:28:57.235,Get ready.
00:29:02.908,00:29:05.451,I'd like to call Lydia Branwell to the stand.
00:29:10.123,00:29:11.875,I don't see the relevance of this whole trial.
00:29:11.958,00:29:13.001,Ms. Branwell?
00:29:13.084,00:29:15.086,If you'll take the stand?
00:29:26.306,00:29:27.849,I just have one question.
00:29:27.933,00:29:30.643,Why are you prosecuting this case?
00:29:34.439,00:29:36.316,"Answer the question, Counselor."
00:29:39.027,00:29:42.072,"Because the Law is hard, but..."
00:29:42.989,00:29:44.324,it is the Law.
00:29:48.536,00:29:53.875,"We're trying someone for being compassionate, thinking for herself."
00:29:53.959,00:29:57.838,She saved a life that was being sacrificed for nothing.
00:29:57.921,00:29:59.089,"That will be enough, Branwell."
00:29:59.172,00:30:01.842,No... it isn't.
00:30:03.343,00:30:05.345,I'm looking out at the faces here.
00:30:11.935,00:30:14.270,and how loyal they are to each other.
00:30:15.771,00:30:25.323,"A man who took this case pretending to want payment in rare objects, but who really believes that injustice toward his friends is intolerable."
00:30:26.324,00:30:31.371,"Loyalty, decency, compassion, love."
00:30:31.454,00:30:36.376,These are the concepts that we should consider to decide guilt or innocence in a case like this.
00:30:39.754,00:30:42.132,"Now, enough of this nonsense."
00:30:42.215,00:30:43.633,I agree.
00:30:43.716,00:30:45.510,The case is nonsense.
00:30:47.137,00:30:48.513,I withdraw the charges.
00:31:02.443,00:31:04.237,Silence!
00:31:04.779,00:31:05.821,Order!
00:31:07.573,00:31:09.242,Silence!
00:31:11.452,00:31:17.125,"If you think refusing to prosecute exculpates the defendant, you are wrong."
00:31:17.208,00:31:18.709,She is guilty.
00:31:21.587,00:31:23.131,The defense was correct.
00:31:23.214,00:31:25.550,The Clave wants the Mortal Cup.
00:31:25.633,00:31:29.888,"If it is returned within 24 hours, this ruling will be vacated."
00:31:29.971,00:31:38.854,"If not, Isabelle Lightwood will be stripped of her runes and exiled from the society of the Shadowhunters forever."
00:31:43.068,00:31:44.194,"Clary, now!"
00:31:44.277,00:31:46.029,We can't wait any longer.
00:31:53.661,00:31:55.621,Find Valentine!
00:32:07.092,00:32:09.885,"Demons, find Valentine!"
00:32:17.185,00:32:18.353,Let me try.
00:32:31.907,00:32:32.951,No.
00:32:49.634,00:32:50.969,Valentine.
00:32:51.052,00:32:52.637,Demons...
00:32:52.720,00:32:54.514,attack my enemies!
00:33:04.149,00:33:06.276,"Knock it off, guys!"
00:33:09.279,00:33:12.365,You're not the only one who knows how to cast a glamour.
00:33:21.416,00:33:23.209,Should we let the demons take care of this?
00:33:23.293,00:33:24.669,-Or-- -No.
00:33:26.546,00:33:28.048,He's mine.
00:33:32.302,00:33:34.470,You pretended to be my father.
00:33:36.139,00:33:38.391,"-I wasn't pretending, Jace. -You murdered him."
00:33:38.474,00:33:39.767,You're a liar!
00:33:40.601,00:33:42.270,I am your father. I always have been.
00:33:43.146,00:33:45.315,The face that you saw as Michael Wayland was mine.
00:33:45.398,00:33:47.192,Then and now.
00:33:47.275,00:33:49.277,It was a powerful glamour.
00:33:49.360,00:33:52.697,I want you to know me as I am.
00:33:52.780,00:33:54.990,To know the truth about me...
00:33:55.950,00:33:56.992,and you.
00:33:58.953,00:34:00.413,He's my father. We know that for a fact.
00:34:00.496,00:34:02.248,"Yes, that's true. That's a fact."
00:34:02.332,00:34:03.916,"I am your father, Clary."
00:34:07.295,00:34:08.338,And Jace's.
00:34:10.506,00:34:11.841,Think about it.
00:34:13.259,00:34:16.429,Why are the two of you so drawn together?
00:34:16.512,00:34:18.764,You are meant to be.
00:34:18.848,00:34:22.060,"Blood calls to blood, no?"
00:34:23.186,00:34:24.520,Ah...
00:34:38.576,00:34:39.952,together at last.
00:34:40.035,00:34:43.123,"A lost mother, found. A brother and sister, finally united."
00:34:45.125,00:34:46.584,You won't kill me.
00:34:48.378,00:34:50.171,"I said that you were weak, and I meant it."
00:34:55.135,00:34:57.262,"Go ahead, Clary. Two for one."
00:34:58.971,00:35:00.098,No?
00:35:01.432,00:35:05.311,"Come with me, son. You know that you love me."
00:35:05.395,00:35:07.062,Your sister is welcome to join us.
00:35:07.147,00:35:08.981,And bring your mother along.
00:35:09.815,00:35:11.692,We can find a way to get her moving again.
00:35:32.213,00:35:33.381,I'm taking you home.
00:35:52.608,00:35:55.110,Hodge is taking her to lock it up until she goes back to Idris.
00:35:56.779,00:35:57.905,Okay.
00:35:58.614,00:35:59.657,Okay?
00:35:59.740,00:36:01.033,"That's it, Alec?"
00:36:01.992,00:36:04.495,-I don't want to get into it. -Stop.
00:36:05.330,00:36:07.248,I do wanna get into it.
00:36:08.708,00:36:09.917,You almost killed me.
00:36:10.000,00:36:13.045,You weakened our parabatai bond just to find me.
00:36:13.128,00:36:14.297,You betrayed me.
00:36:14.380,00:36:15.381,You lied to me.
00:36:24.557,00:36:29.019,"If you'd have taken Meliorn to be tortured, you would have that on your conscience for the rest of your life."
00:36:31.397,00:36:34.400,Everything you do is for a higher principle.
00:36:34.484,00:36:38.613,"You took the Cup, and you nearly handed it over to Valentine."
00:36:38.696,00:36:41.199,That was not our intention. You know that.
00:36:41.282,00:36:42.783,Our intention?
00:36:45.620,00:36:48.206,Was it your intention to risk Izzy's life for hers?
00:36:48.289,00:36:51.083,This isn't about Clary. This is about you.
00:36:52.877,00:36:54.337,"Now, I'm gonna go tell my sister..."
00:36:55.713,00:36:57.507,that she still has a future.
00:37:12.647,00:37:14.148,Do you think she can hear us?
00:37:15.190,00:37:16.401,Where is she?
00:37:17.360,00:37:20.363,Is she trapped in there? Is she somewhere else?
00:37:21.364,00:37:24.325,"I mean, I... I look at her, and I see my mother, but..."
00:37:26.786,00:37:28.162,How did you know...
00:37:29.079,00:37:30.331,that he was Valentine?
00:37:31.957,00:37:34.168,There was... just something off.
00:37:35.253,00:37:39.006,"He told me that he knew my mother was pregnant, but he couldn't have."
00:37:39.089,00:37:40.425,You should've told me.
00:37:41.259,00:37:42.885,Would you have believed me?
00:37:46.221,00:37:47.973,There's something wrong with me.
00:37:48.933,00:37:50.726,You wanted to believe him.
00:37:52.895,00:37:54.146,No.
00:37:55.815,00:37:58.734,I'm weak. He was right about that.
00:38:00.278,00:38:01.862,I should have killed him.
00:38:01.946,00:38:03.906,"He's your father, Jace."
00:38:05.491,00:38:06.909,"Yours, too, Clary."
00:38:11.747,00:38:12.873,You would have done it.
00:38:22.758,00:38:24.844,I'm sorry we lost the case.
00:38:26.429,00:38:27.555,Yeah...
00:38:27.638,00:38:29.765,but at least we lost it with style.
00:38:37.272,00:38:38.899,Jace and Clary are back.
00:38:42.778,00:38:44.238,You're free to go.
00:38:49.369,00:38:51.746,"Oh, I didn't actually."
00:38:54.415,00:38:56.000,"Well, my work is done here."
00:39:00.380,00:39:02.715,We have some business to settle.
00:39:29.450,00:39:30.701,As promised...
00:39:30.785,00:39:32.745,payment in full.
00:39:32.828,00:39:34.329,Thank you.
00:39:43.798,00:39:45.007,I just want you to know...
00:39:45.090,00:39:47.051,Lydia was wonderful in court.
00:39:47.134,00:39:49.219,-She's great. -So you get it.
00:39:49.303,00:39:50.430,"No, Alec."
00:39:51.722,00:39:54.266,I get her. I like her.
00:39:55.560,00:39:57.186,But you don't have to marry her.
00:39:57.269,00:39:58.979,"Yes, I do, Magnus."
00:39:59.063,00:40:01.857,"You'll be lonely all your life, and so will she."
00:40:02.775,00:40:04.276,Neither of you deserve it.
00:40:05.653,00:40:07.362,And I don't either.
00:40:13.077,00:40:15.287,I don't know what to do with these.
00:40:15.370,00:40:16.539,You keep them for me.
00:40:29.051,00:40:32.555,"Wait, did you see Michael Wayland transform into Valentine?"
00:40:32.638,00:40:37.101,"After I took care of Blackwell, I couldn't get back in the room until all the demons cleared out."
00:40:37.184,00:40:38.227,Huh.
00:40:40.855,00:40:42.732,And then all I saw was Jocelyn.
00:40:42.815,00:40:44.358,You're still in love with her.
00:40:45.359,00:40:47.111,Being a werewolf didn't change that.
00:40:50.906,00:40:52.575,"You know, Clary was right."
00:40:55.369,00:40:57.872,And when you find the one... that's it.
00:41:04.211,00:41:05.254,you know...
00:41:08.549,00:41:10.217,But there was this other guy.
00:41:10.300,00:41:13.178,"He was big, handsome, full of sh..."
00:41:15.055,00:41:18.142,"He's okay, you know. I'm over it."
00:41:18.225,00:41:20.853,I guess I'll just always be alone.
00:41:25.858,00:41:27.317,-Simon. -Yeah.
00:41:29.529,00:41:31.446,There's more to what happened at Renwick's.
00:41:31.531,00:41:32.698,"I mean, if you want to know."
00:41:32.782,00:41:33.824,Yeah.
00:41:34.700,00:41:38.120,Turns out Valentine is Jace's father as well as Clary's.
00:41:40.122,00:41:41.582,They're brother and sister.
00:41:43.042,00:41:46.378,Uh... brother and sis...
00:41:50.841,00:41:53.218,Clary and Jace are... brother and sister.
00:41:53.302,00:41:55.721,That means... That means they can't...
00:41:59.183,00:42:00.726,"Well, what do you know?"
00:00:10.552,00:00:12.720,-We need blood. -So I've heard.
00:00:12.804,00:00:14.181,Human blood.
00:00:14.264,00:00:17.350,Everything's out of control. We were fools to believe Valentine was dead.
00:00:19.102,00:00:20.853,My sister wants you to be her defense attorney.
00:00:22.021,00:00:23.356,-Name it. -You.
00:00:33.200,00:00:34.659,They're brother and sister.
00:00:34.742,00:00:36.119,That means they can't...
00:00:36.203,00:00:38.746,You'll be lonely all your life. Neither of you deserve it.
00:00:38.830,00:00:40.040,And I don't either.
00:00:42.917,00:00:44.544,Bring the flowers out to the wedding tent.
00:00:44.627,00:00:47.797,"Put the lilies up on the dais, and lay the rose petals at the entrance."
00:00:50.133,00:00:52.302,It's for the curtains adorning the wedding tent.
00:00:53.886,00:00:58.225,"The cobalt blue. It's elegant, masculine... very Alec."
00:01:00.685,00:01:03.063,How are we supposed to get any work done with all this going on?
00:01:05.232,00:01:06.774,People are allowed to be excited.
00:01:06.858,00:01:08.443,We need to focus.
00:01:08.526,00:01:11.821,Have you narrowed down the list of warlocks more powerful than Magnus Bane?
00:01:14.616,00:01:17.285,But it's gonna be hard to figure out which one cast that spell on Jocelyn.
00:01:17.369,00:01:19.871,"I don't care how tough it is, we've gotta find him."
00:01:19.954,00:01:23.166,"Back at Renwick's, I let Valentine go. I won't make that mistake again."
00:01:23.250,00:01:26.711,"We gotta wake up Jocelyn, in case she heard anything about his plan."
00:01:26.794,00:01:27.920,Have you spoken to Alec?
00:01:28.004,00:01:29.881,"He's probably busy, what with wedding plans and all."
00:01:29.964,00:01:31.799,And I don't need to talk to anyone.
00:01:31.883,00:01:33.551,"Let's just stick to the mission, okay?"
00:01:47.732,00:01:49.442,She looks so peaceful now.
00:01:50.777,00:01:53.029,I just wish I knew how to reach her.
00:01:53.113,00:01:54.156,It's gonna be fine.
00:01:56.408,00:01:58.410,"I'm sorry, Clary."
00:01:58.493,00:02:02.747,"We should have told you everything before this got-- Luke, we can hash all that out when we wake Mom up."
00:02:03.998,00:02:05.958,The important thing now is that we have her back.
00:02:07.460,00:02:09.212,I'm looking for Lydia.
00:02:09.296,00:02:12.340,Have you seen her? I don't mean to interrupt or anything.
00:02:12.424,00:02:14.676,"-No, stay for a minute. -I gotta get back to the station."
00:02:14.759,00:02:16.928,-Call me if anything changes? -Yeah.
00:02:24.769,00:02:26.020,"So, how is she?"
00:02:29.649,00:02:32.569,"Alec, I know you and I don't always see eye to eye on things..."
00:02:33.278,00:02:35.822,"Actually, we never see eye to eye on anything."
00:02:35.905,00:02:39.867,But I do want to thank you for everything you've done to get my mom back.
00:02:40.910,00:02:43.413,Actually I... I should thank you.
00:02:43.496,00:02:48.167,I don't know what would have happened to Isabelle after the trial if you hadn't returned the Cup.
00:02:49.377,00:02:51.921,"You saved my sister, so thank you."
00:03:06.353,00:03:07.604,Magnus needs to speak with me.
00:03:07.687,00:03:12.234,He might have some information about how to wake your mother up or... stop Valentine.
00:03:12.317,00:03:14.944,-It's important. -Mmm. Yeah.
00:03:20.783,00:03:24.287,Hello... Magnus? You said you needed to talk to me.
00:03:26.038,00:03:27.457,I wasn't sure if you'd come.
00:03:33.963,00:03:35.757,I didn't come here to drink.
00:03:38.218,00:03:40.177,On the warlock who cast a spell on Jocelyn?
00:03:40.262,00:03:42.430,I'm looking into it. But...
00:03:42.514,00:03:45.808,we never really finished our conversation after Izzy's trial.
00:03:46.893,00:03:48.019,About your wedding.
00:03:51.481,00:03:54.442,"You and I, we understand marriage very differently."
00:03:54.526,00:03:56.152,I'm a Shadowhunter.
00:03:56.236,00:04:00.365,"This is about family, and tradition, honor-- Honor?"
00:04:01.491,00:04:03.243,Where's the honor in living a lie?
00:04:03.326,00:04:04.452,What are you talking about?
00:04:05.620,00:04:07.204,What about love?
00:04:08.164,00:04:10.124,"Even Shadowhunters fall in love, Alec."
00:04:11.793,00:04:15.463,"Just tell me you're in love with Lydia, and I'll stop."
00:04:19.842,00:04:20.885,I don't know.
00:04:22.094,00:04:23.305,Why do you keep pushing?
00:04:27.559,00:04:29.060,You're confusing me.
00:04:31.896,00:04:33.815,Confusion is part of it.
00:04:33.898,00:04:35.650,That's how you find out if something's there.
00:04:35.733,00:04:38.110,Emotions are never black and white.
00:04:44.992,00:04:48.288,You lose your breath every time they enter a room.
00:04:51.416,00:04:54.251,Your heart beats faster when they walk by.
00:04:55.670,00:04:59.299,Your skin tingles when they stand close enough to feel their breath.
00:05:10.977,00:05:13.480,"I know you feel what I feel, Alec."
00:05:18.693,00:05:19.819,so back off.
00:05:22.196,00:05:24.991,"This is all just a game to you, isn't it?"
00:05:26.075,00:05:31.247,"You flirt, you laugh, you use magic, but at the end of the day, what do you risk?"
00:05:31.331,00:05:34.000,Even if I did feel something for you...
00:05:35.001,00:05:36.335,you want me to give up my life for you?
00:05:37.128,00:05:38.671,I have to do what's right for me.
00:05:38.755,00:05:41.549,"I could lose my family, my career, everything!"
00:05:44.176,00:05:45.845,You just don't get it.
00:05:47.138,00:05:48.431,You have a choice to make.
00:05:52.560,00:05:54.311,I will not ask again.
00:06:08.785,00:06:09.952,"Hey, Clary. What's goin' on?"
00:06:10.036,00:06:11.996,"I just, uh, needed to hear your voice."
00:06:12.079,00:06:13.415,Are you okay? You sound upset.
00:06:13.498,00:06:14.541,"Yeah, I'm fine. Just..."
00:06:14.624,00:06:18.628,"things are kind of weird with Jace right now, but we'll work it out."
00:06:18.711,00:06:19.962,So how's your mom?
00:06:22.381,00:06:25.468,"We still have to wake her up, but at least she's away from Valentine."
00:06:25.552,00:06:26.678,When can I see her?
00:06:26.761,00:06:29.180,How about tomorrow night? She's here at the infirmary.
00:06:33.350,00:06:35.061,Really? I...
00:06:40.900,00:06:43.611,"Besides, you are the person I'm closest to in the world."
00:06:43.695,00:06:45.738,-Please come. -I'd love to.
00:06:51.243,00:06:53.830,-I'll see you tomorrow. -Yeah.
00:07:00.837,00:07:03.047,Morning. You just come from training?
00:07:03.130,00:07:05.675,"Yeah. I'm, uh, workin' on my right hook."
00:07:05.758,00:07:07.552,Good. That's a good punch.
00:07:07.635,00:07:09.804,"Yeah. I'm, uh, I'm workin' on it."
00:07:09.887,00:07:15.059,"While this conversation is no doubt scintillating, remind me why we couldn't do this at my place?"
00:07:15.142,00:07:16.728,At least there we'd have cocktails.
00:07:16.811,00:07:18.354,It's 9:00 in the morning.
00:07:18.438,00:07:19.856,"Oh, it's happy hour somewhere, my dear."
00:07:21.441,00:07:24.444,because Hodge can't leave the Institute. He's an important part of this mission.
00:07:24.527,00:07:27.447,"Well, then where is our tardy little tutor?"
00:07:27.530,00:07:30.407,"There are certain individuals that I'd like to avoid, so let's make this quick."
00:07:35.412,00:07:38.916,"Now, we've narrowed down our list of warlocks to these three."
00:07:42.419,00:07:44.464,"Well, some would disagree. He is older than you."
00:07:44.547,00:07:47.008,-Certainly not wiser. -Who is Ragnor Fell?
00:07:48.676,00:07:50.637,And one of my oldest friends.
00:07:50.720,00:07:53.055,"Very prickly, likes to keep to himself."
00:07:53.139,00:08:01.481,"Okay, look. We just need to figure out which one of these warlocks had enough access to Jocelyn that they could create the potion for her without anyone discovering what they'd done."
00:08:01.564,00:08:05.359,"By the early '90s, Ragnor was a professor at the Shadowhunter Academy in Idris."
00:08:05.442,00:08:08.571,Isn't that when my mother lived there? Could he have made the potion for her?
00:08:08.655,00:08:10.406,The little bugger!
00:08:10.490,00:08:12.700,That's why he hasn't responded to my fire message.
00:08:12.784,00:08:18.706,"Ever since Valentine began hunting warlocks, Ragnor's been holed up in his secret country house just outside of London."
00:08:18.790,00:08:24.546,"For all I know, Ragnor suspected my fire message was a ploy by Valentine to lure him out of hiding."
00:08:24.629,00:08:26.673,We'll have to confront him face-to-face.
00:08:29.050,00:08:30.802,I'm the only one Ragnor trusts.
00:08:30.885,00:08:34.931,"Besides, I've played my last hand here. Even I know when to fold."
00:08:37.266,00:08:39.476,"Magnus, I didn't know you were here."
00:08:39.561,00:08:41.437,That was the point.
00:08:44.315,00:08:46.651,who arrived early for tomorrow's wedding.
00:08:46.734,00:08:47.902,How long are you staying?
00:08:47.985,00:08:50.321,What's going on here? Nobody told me about a meeting.
00:08:50.404,00:08:53.282,Magnus figured out that Ragnor Fell is the warlock who can wake my mom.
00:08:53.365,00:08:55.117,We're just bringing him back to the Institute.
00:08:55.201,00:08:56.619,How can I help?
00:08:56.703,00:08:58.996,"We're just recovering a warlock, Alec. We got this covered."
00:08:59.080,00:09:02.499,"Besides, you have emissaries from the Clave to meet."
00:09:02.584,00:09:06.253,"You don't want to tarnish your family's perfectly-crafted image, now do you?"
00:09:10.216,00:09:12.134,"Again, lovely seeing you, Magnus."
00:09:19.100,00:09:21.227,Get ready. We leave in an hour.
00:09:24.438,00:09:27.984,"Jace. Jace, slow down. We need to talk about this."
00:09:28.067,00:09:30.903,"Talk about what? We're good, okay?"
00:09:30.987,00:09:34.657,"No, we're not. At least... I'm not."
00:09:34.741,00:09:36.784,We need to talk about what Valentine said about us.
00:09:36.868,00:09:38.119,"Look, I don't want to talk about it."
00:09:38.202,00:09:40.496,It happened. I feel weird right now.
00:09:53.175,00:10:00.224,"Now that the Clave has control of the Mortal Cup, thanks to your lovely bride-to-be, Mom and Dad can come home now. They arrive tonight."
00:10:00.307,00:10:01.433,I heard.
00:10:04.729,00:10:08.315,"Now with all the dignitaries arriving for the wedding, Mom must be beside herself."
00:10:13.863,00:10:16.115,"Alec, you don't have to go through with this if you don't want to."
00:10:16.198,00:10:17.533,It's what I want.
00:10:17.617,00:10:19.535,-Okay. -Okay?
00:10:19.619,00:10:21.162,No big argument from you?
00:10:21.245,00:10:25.041,"You stood by me through my trial, and now I'm standing by you, big brother."
00:10:27.293,00:10:29.754,And... I'm throwing you a bachelor party.
00:10:30.963,00:10:33.007,-A what? -A bachelor party.
00:10:33.090,00:10:34.801,I don't need a bachelor party.
00:10:34.884,00:10:38.971,"No one needs a bachelor party, but I'm throwing you one anyways."
00:10:39.055,00:10:44.393,"Actually, Jace should be the one throwing it, but considering everything he must be going through with Clary..."
00:10:44.476,00:10:47.146,I don't wanna ask him to do anything. You know what I mean?
00:10:47.229,00:10:50.524,I do. Sisters can really drive you nuts sometimes.
00:10:53.736,00:10:55.822,Ragnor's house is just across these fields.
00:10:55.905,00:10:56.906,Let's make this quick.
00:10:56.989,00:11:00.534,We'll talk to Ragnor and Portal him back to the Institute before anyone knows we're gone.
00:11:01.744,00:11:04.664,"So... brother and sister, huh?"
00:11:08.042,00:11:10.920,"All about the mission, and totally ignore the huge bomb that just dropped on us."
00:11:13.214,00:11:15.466,"What do you want me to say, Clary? That I was attracted to my sister?"
00:11:15.549,00:11:18.970,"-No-- -Point of fact, brother and sisters are often attracted to each other."
00:11:22.932,00:11:25.642,Maybe this will all make sense when we wake up Jocelyn.
00:11:30.773,00:11:32.441,"At best, Jocelyn is the woman who abandoned me."
00:11:33.650,00:11:35.987,My mother would never abandon her son. She thought you were dead.
00:11:36.070,00:11:38.823,"-Or maybe she just didn't want me. -You don't know her, Jace."
00:11:38.906,00:11:40.992,"That's right, Clary, I don't. Do you?"
00:11:41.075,00:11:47.664,"I'm sorry I asked! I came with you to escape my relationship drama, not get a front row seat to yours."
00:11:50.459,00:11:51.794,"-What was that? -Nice try, Jace."
00:11:51.878,00:11:54.713,You're not getting out of this conversation that easily.
00:11:54.797,00:11:56.173,Look out!
00:12:03.264,00:12:05.224,Ragnor put up wards to protect his lair.
00:12:06.225,00:12:08.019,Why is the fire green?
00:12:08.102,00:12:11.898,It's a wall of fire that only the pure of heart and intention can pass through.
00:12:13.357,00:12:14.733,Are you ready?
00:12:27.789,00:12:29.206,Jace?
00:12:30.166,00:12:31.250,Magnus?
00:12:32.209,00:12:33.710,Where are you?
00:12:44.263,00:12:45.389,Ragnor Fell.
00:12:53.564,00:12:56.150,Ragnor? Ragnor?
00:13:03.490,00:13:04.867,Hello?
00:13:12.208,00:13:14.335,Is anybody home?
00:13:19.340,00:13:21.133,"Ragnor, I know you're here."
00:13:22.259,00:13:24.636,I just need to find my friends.
00:13:37.608,00:13:39.318,"Nice try, Ragnor."
00:13:43.239,00:13:46.450,Well done... Clary Fairchild.
00:13:46.533,00:13:49.828,"I've been expecting you. You have Jocelyn's talent, I see."
00:13:49.912,00:13:53.040,Only a true artist would notice the subtle changes in my eyes.
00:13:53.124,00:13:54.166,"Yes, I know."
00:13:54.250,00:13:57.336,I need to work on not moving my eyes. You don't need to remind me.
00:13:57.419,00:13:59.213,You knew my mom?
00:13:59.296,00:14:01.173,So you made the potion that put her to sleep?
00:14:01.257,00:14:02.758,"At her request, yes."
00:14:02.841,00:14:06.262,And I knew it was only a matter of time before you came to me looking for the antidote.
00:14:06.345,00:14:07.930,"Please, sit."
00:14:08.014,00:14:10.807,"My friends, Jace Wayland and Magnus Bane."
00:14:10.892,00:14:13.144,"They were with me, but I lost them in the fire."
00:14:13.227,00:14:16.105,"Let me do this my way! Your friends, are they true?"
00:14:16.188,00:14:19.066,Magnus said he's known you for centuries. He sent you a fire message.
00:14:21.944,00:14:23.070,"Okay, what is your deal?"
00:14:23.154,00:14:27.783,"My friends are missing and if you can't help me, -I will find someone who can. -What is it worth to you?"
00:14:27.867,00:14:30.286,If you find my friends and wake my mother...
00:14:31.703,00:14:35.875,-I'll give you anything. -That's what I wanted to hear.
00:14:41.713,00:14:43.049,Of course. She offered me anything.
00:14:43.132,00:14:45.384,You were only up to a timeshare of your flat in Paris.
00:14:45.467,00:14:48.137,"-Yawn. -All right, enough with the warlock games."
00:14:49.596,00:14:51.015,Not without the Book of the White.
00:14:51.098,00:14:52.391,What is the Book of the White?
00:14:56.395,00:14:57.980,most warlocks could ever imagine.
00:14:58.605,00:15:02.443,"I possessed the book when your mother came to me, and I used its contents to create the potion."
00:15:02.526,00:15:04.403,"Regrettably, I no longer have the book."
00:15:04.486,00:15:06.863,I asked Jocelyn to hide it that Valentine might never find it.
00:15:06.948,00:15:08.699,"Ragnor, please, I have to get my mom back."
00:15:08.782,00:15:10.576,Is there any way to get the Book of the White?
00:15:10.659,00:15:12.703,Possibly. I may have something that can help us.
00:15:12.786,00:15:14.914,Won't be but a moment.
00:15:14.997,00:15:16.665,What do we do if he can't find the book?
00:15:16.748,00:15:18.084,We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
00:15:18.167,00:15:19.919,"It's a bit drab, isn't it?"
00:15:25.341,00:15:27.218,-Ragnor! -Shax demon.
00:15:30.930,00:15:32.848,Creature took me... by surprise.
00:15:32.932,00:15:35.017,How could a Shax demon get past Ragnor's wards?
00:15:35.101,00:15:38.104,It must have followed us. Jumped through when the fire wall reset.
00:15:38.187,00:15:40.272,"Be still, my little dear cabbage."
00:15:40.356,00:15:42.108,Your wounds are deep.
00:15:42.191,00:15:44.318,"Hold on, please."
00:15:54.078,00:15:58.124,"For centuries, this man knew me better than anyone."
00:15:58.207,00:16:00.917,"Magnus, I'm so sorry."
00:16:01.002,00:16:02.753,"We have to leave, now."
00:16:02.836,00:16:07.133,We can't. Not until we find whatever it is Ragnor said could help us locate the Book of the White.
00:16:07.216,00:16:08.259,It's too dangerous.
00:16:08.342,00:16:10.844,"If one Shax demon found us, you can bet there are more on the way."
00:16:12.304,00:16:15.682,We don't have time to scour through mountains of Ragnor's stuff.
00:16:19.520,00:16:20.854,Get back to the Institute.
00:16:20.937,00:16:24.108,I'll transport everything back to my place and find what you need.
00:16:48.715,00:16:50.759,"Jace, you're coming to Alec's bachelor party, right?"
00:16:50.842,00:16:53.679,"No. He doesn't want me there, and I'm swamped."
00:16:53.762,00:16:55.306,You two seriously haven't worked things out yet?
00:16:55.389,00:16:57.641,"There's nothing to work out. If he wants to talk, we'll talk."
00:16:57.724,00:16:59.268,He's your parabatai.
00:17:02.146,00:17:04.981,We have more important things going on than a bachelor party.
00:17:05.066,00:17:06.608,Come with me.
00:17:13.657,00:17:15.159,We have a mole in the Institute.
00:17:15.242,00:17:18.245,We were attacked by a Shax demon when we went to see Ragnor Fell.
00:17:18.329,00:17:20.164,The attack couldn't have been coincidence.
00:17:20.247,00:17:22.333,Valentine must have been tracking us.
00:17:22.416,00:17:25.127,You don't think someone from the Institute told Valentine where you were going.
00:17:25.211,00:17:28.964,-There's no other explanation. -No one here would betray us like that.
00:17:38.890,00:17:40.934,We're bringing him back to the Institute.
00:17:42.144,00:17:44.271,Not everyone's family yet.
00:17:46.815,00:17:50.444,"I swear, if Lydia is the leak, I'm gonna-- Slow down. We don't know if she did anything yet."
00:17:50.527,00:17:53.029,And wrongfully accusing someone of a crime is dangerous.
00:17:55.031,00:17:57.784,Lydia was right there when we were talking about Ragnor Fell.
00:17:57.868,00:18:00.496,"If she's not gonna admit what she did, I'm gonna make her admit it."
00:18:00.579,00:18:03.332,"Jace, stop. You are too worked up to talk to anyone right now."
00:18:03.415,00:18:05.917,Especially not an important envoy from the Clave.
00:18:06.001,00:18:11.423,"Let me talk to Lydia. If you accuse Alec's fiancée of treason, you will ruin whatever relationship you have left with him."
00:18:11.507,00:18:15.469,"Clary's right, Jace. If Lydia did this, she might not be so defensive with Clary."
00:18:15.552,00:18:17.346,She might let her guard down.
00:18:17.429,00:18:18.847,-Slip up. -Fine.
00:18:18.930,00:18:21.433,But I wanna know everything she says.
00:18:27.356,00:18:28.732,It's perfect. I love it.
00:18:28.815,00:18:31.318,I'm so glad. Let me know if you need anything else.
00:18:35.239,00:18:37.408,-Your dress is stunning. -Thank you.
00:18:37.491,00:18:41.537,I feel more nervous wearing that dress than I ever have on the battlefield.
00:18:41.620,00:18:43.580,I think that's pretty normal.
00:18:45.624,00:18:48.752,"Lydia, I need to talk to you about something."
00:18:48.835,00:18:50.379,What is it?
00:18:50.462,00:18:52.881,Valentine sent a Shax demon to track us on our mission today.
00:18:52.964,00:18:55.301,It killed Ragnor Fell.
00:18:55.384,00:18:56.468,By the Angel...
00:18:56.552,00:19:00.681,Only a few people here at the Institute even knew we were going on the mission.
00:19:02.433,00:19:05.227,"You overheard us this morning, then we were attacked."
00:19:05.311,00:19:10.524,"If I was working for Valentine, don't you think I would have already given him the Mortal Cup?"
00:19:12.151,00:19:13.485,I don't believe this.
00:19:13.569,00:19:17.030,Fellow Shadowhunters accusing me of high treason.
00:19:17.113,00:19:19.200,"-Lydia, I'm not accusing you of anything. -Of course you are."
00:19:19.283,00:19:24.955,"Unless you have hard evidence to back your claims, -I believe this conversation is over. -Fine, but know this."
00:19:25.038,00:19:28.167,These people have become like family to me...
00:19:29.042,00:19:32.213,-and I protect my family. -I care about them too.
00:19:32.296,00:19:34.215,Why else would I be marrying Alec?
00:19:34.298,00:19:36.342,How well do you actually know him?
00:19:36.425,00:19:39.345,You're talking about Alec's feelings for Magnus? I'm not blind.
00:19:39.428,00:19:42.598,"If... if you're not in love with Alec, then why are you going through with this marriage?"
00:19:42.681,00:19:51.022,Alec's love for his family and his desire to restore the Lightwood name has touched me in ways that I haven't felt in a very long time.
00:19:51.106,00:19:54.651,Alec is a man of honor... and I truly care about him.
00:19:56.653,00:20:01.408,Shadowhunters know that our duty to our family supersedes our personal desires.
00:20:01.492,00:20:08.249,"Look, I know that you're still new to this world and our traditions may seem foreign to you, but I-- Yeah, more like ice cold."
00:20:08.332,00:20:13.587,"Alec should not have to give up who he is, or at least the chance to figure it out, just to please his family."
00:20:13.670,00:20:14.963,Alec proposed to me.
00:20:15.046,00:20:16.757,This is what he wants.
00:20:25.056,00:20:26.141,How do I trust you?
00:20:26.225,00:20:28.310,You're Valentine's daughter...
00:20:29.311,00:20:30.646,and I learned to trust you.
00:20:48.163,00:20:50.332,Nice. Trim fit.
00:20:58.214,00:20:59.716,"First time for everything, huh?"
00:21:00.801,00:21:02.636,"You can go now, Stan. What's up?"
00:21:03.262,00:21:05.055,It's about Alec's bachelor party.
00:21:05.138,00:21:07.849,"When you were a mundane, you went to one, right?"
00:21:07.933,00:21:11.437,"Well, I'm only 18, and I'm a vampire now, so..."
00:21:17.108,00:21:21.071,what makes a bachelor party... a bachelor party?
00:21:21.154,00:21:30.997,"Well, there is a certain bridge and tunnel crowd But, you know, there's no one right way to throw a bachelor party."
00:21:31.081,00:21:33.083,It... depends on who's there.
00:21:44.636,00:21:48.932,So it's about solidifying the bonds with the people that are closest to you?
00:21:49.015,00:21:50.434,"That, and a ton of drinking."
00:22:05.657,00:22:07.743,How I loathe that photograph.
00:22:07.826,00:22:11.872,"I must remember, chin down, eyes up. Otherwise, I look like a squinty toad."
00:22:13.206,00:22:14.290,You're here.
00:22:14.375,00:22:17.002,"You didn't think you'd be rid of me that easily, did you?"
00:22:21.382,00:22:24.050,"Now, please, put away that horrid photograph."
00:22:24.134,00:22:26.011,It commemorates a night I'd rather forget.
00:22:30.682,00:22:34.060,"I prayed she would love me the same, but she just laughed."
00:22:34.144,00:22:37.439,"To Camille, immortals aren't supposed to feel true love."
00:22:40.150,00:22:42.068,Camille broke my heart.
00:22:42.152,00:22:44.029,"You let her break your heart, my friend."
00:22:45.113,00:22:48.324,You're immortal... but she killed you.
00:23:13.058,00:23:15.602,"-We're almost there! -All right, Izzy..."
00:23:15.686,00:23:17.395,"You trust me, don't you?"
00:23:19.355,00:23:20.982,"And I told you, I don't need a bachelor party."
00:23:23.819,00:23:27.238,"Now, count to five and take your blindfold off."
00:23:27.322,00:23:28.907,"Really, Izzy?"
00:23:34.412,00:23:35.539,Seriously?
00:23:41.462,00:23:42.796,Izzy said you wanted to talk.
00:23:43.839,00:23:46.049,I don't know what she thought I wanted to say.
00:23:46.132,00:23:48.426,Great. I guess I'll go.
00:23:48.510,00:23:50.596,I've got work to do anyway.
00:23:59.605,00:24:01.523,We do need to talk.
00:24:01.607,00:24:05.861,"Okay. Well, it's my bachelor party, so you go first."
00:24:08.655,00:24:10.574,I don't know how things got so messed up between us.
00:24:11.700,00:24:15.036,But I do know my life has been a lot harder not having you to talk to.
00:24:18.456,00:24:21.668,I know it seems like I've been making a lot of crazy choices lately.
00:24:21.752,00:24:28.634,"And I know you think that I was only thinking about myself... and Clary, and I wasn't thinking about the consequences to anyone else."
00:24:29.593,00:24:32.137,"All I can say is, I've been going through a lot."
00:24:33.722,00:24:36.224,"But I only ever did what I thought was right, Alec."
00:24:42.105,00:24:43.273,I'm sorry.
00:24:44.900,00:24:45.984,I know.
00:24:47.778,00:24:50.906,"You know, we just... got caught in all this drama."
00:24:53.241,00:24:55.577,I mean... you're getting married tomorrow.
00:24:55.661,00:24:58.705,"And Clary's your sister. You know, what's up with that?"
00:24:58.789,00:25:02.083,"Oh, yeah, uh, don't even get me started on that."
00:25:08.173,00:25:09.925,-I kissed her. -Mmm.
00:25:10.008,00:25:11.843,"What's worse, I wanted her."
00:25:13.511,00:25:15.013,I was falling in love.
00:25:17.891,00:25:19.601,I must be sick or something. I don't know.
00:25:19.685,00:25:20.727,No.
00:25:23.313,00:25:24.397,Nah.
00:25:27.025,00:25:28.401,You're not sick.
00:25:29.903,00:25:31.697,The situation's just...
00:25:31.780,00:25:33.073,It's confusing.
00:25:36.076,00:25:37.368,"And trust me, I know."
00:25:37.452,00:25:41.582,"You know, it's like, you have this plan for your life..."
00:25:41.665,00:25:45.836,"right, and you know what you need to do and what your responsibilities are."
00:25:45.919,00:25:49.756,"And you think, you know, if you follow the rules, everything's gonna be fine."
00:25:54.720,00:25:56.012,You just...
00:25:56.096,00:25:59.057,Hey... I get it.
00:26:02.728,00:26:06.022,"The point is, we're Shadowhunters. Emotions get in the way."
00:26:06.106,00:26:09.943,"And if you get knocked off the path, you have to focus..."
00:26:10.026,00:26:11.319,and find your way back.
00:26:13.989,00:26:15.115,I am.
00:26:19.870,00:26:21.705,I'm fulfilling my duty.
00:26:28.003,00:26:30.922,"Look, would you be my suggenes and give me away tomorrow?"
00:26:33.549,00:26:36.427,"Alec, if this is what you really want..."
00:26:40.932,00:26:42.350,I'm always gonna be here for you.
00:26:42.433,00:26:43.935,"Me, too."
00:27:01.244,00:27:03.747,I wouldn't describe that as an instrument of music.
00:27:03.830,00:27:05.123,"An instrument of torture, perhaps."
00:27:05.206,00:27:08.501,"-Oh, you never liked the charango. -No, I did not."
00:27:08.584,00:27:10.586,And I pray you don't play it.
00:27:10.671,00:27:12.964,Death has already given me enough of a headache.
00:27:13.048,00:27:16.342,Do you remember Imasu? He played this so beautifully.
00:27:16.426,00:27:18.720,I'm surprised that lasted as long as it did.
00:27:22.933,00:27:25.226,I don't understand why you didn't go after the boy.
00:27:25.310,00:27:28.146,"I'm certain, with very little effort, you could have won him back."
00:27:28.229,00:27:31.107,No. Imasu wanted more than I can give.
00:27:33.443,00:27:36.822,Maybe Camille was right. I am immortal.
00:27:36.905,00:27:41.617,I can party and have fun to my heart's content without the anchors of love around my feet.
00:27:43.119,00:27:49.710,"And though I know you won't believe me, someday someone will come along who will tear down those walls you've built around your heart."
00:27:49.793,00:27:56.007,"And when that love comes back to you, you must do everything in your power to fight for it."
00:28:05.892,00:28:07.268,Going somewhere?
00:28:12.440,00:28:15.360,Be nice if you took it more than once every 300 years.
00:28:18.363,00:28:19.405,I...
00:28:35.713,00:28:39.259,"When you first proposed to Lydia, I'll admit, I was wary."
00:28:39.342,00:28:40.886,But now...
00:28:44.430,00:28:46.099,You've made me so proud.
00:28:55.566,00:28:57.485,-As ready as I'll ever be. -Good.
00:28:57.568,00:28:58.904,I'm glad you're here with me.
00:29:00.613,00:29:02.323,Wouldn't be anywhere else.
00:29:27.473,00:29:29.309,-Hey. Sorry I'm late. -Hey.
00:29:29.392,00:29:30.894,Did I miss anything? I left right at sunset.
00:29:30.977,00:29:32.020,"No, you're right on time."
00:29:32.103,00:29:33.479,"-Cool. -Simon, you look incredible."
00:29:36.691,00:29:37.943,Embracing the new me.
00:29:39.903,00:29:41.529,"-So, how's your mom? -She's good."
00:29:41.612,00:29:43.573,"Uh, Luke's with her right now, watching over her."
00:29:46.284,00:29:50.121,The ceremony is about to commence.
00:30:10.766,00:30:12.018,Wow.
00:31:03.653,00:31:08.283,to mark each other with the Wedded Union rune.
00:31:08.366,00:31:11.369,"A rune on the hand, a rune on the heart."
00:31:12.037,00:31:14.039,A union is born.
00:31:41.316,00:31:43.193,What's that warlock doing here?
00:31:47.613,00:31:48.823,did Alec invite Magnus?
00:31:57.373,00:31:59.750,"Magnus, leave this wedding now."
00:31:59.834,00:32:02.503,"Maryse, this is between me and your son."
00:32:02.587,00:32:04.965,I'll leave if he asks me to.
00:32:14.099,00:32:15.391,"Are you gonna be okay, buddy?"
00:32:17.102,00:32:18.269,Alec?
00:32:27.988,00:32:30.406,I know. It's okay.
00:32:32.492,00:32:33.618,I can't do this.
00:32:34.535,00:32:36.037,"I thought we were doing the right thing, but..."
00:32:36.871,00:32:37.913,this isn't it.
00:32:37.998,00:32:39.374,You don't have to explain.
00:32:39.457,00:32:40.791,"Lydia, I'm sorry."
00:32:40.875,00:32:45.171,Hey... you deserve to be happy.
00:32:48.216,00:32:49.592,I'll be fine.
00:33:20.123,00:33:22.167,"-Alec, what are you doing? -Enough."
00:33:46.482,00:33:48.318,"You never cease to amaze me, Alec."
00:33:50.153,00:33:51.862,What did I just do?
00:34:04.917,00:34:07.545,"Alec, I am so proud of you."
00:34:09.839,00:34:12.175,"Guys, that was incredible."
00:34:12.258,00:34:13.759,It was like watching the live version of The Graduate.
00:34:13.843,00:34:16.804,"You know, the Dustin Hoffman movie? The amazing one?"
00:34:16.887,00:34:19.682,You were Ben. Elaine! And you were Elaine.
00:34:19.765,00:34:23.061,"I mean, a... a taller, masculine, handsome version of her."
00:34:23.144,00:34:25.313,"But at the altar, though, you were like..."
00:34:25.396,00:34:26.439,Ben!
00:34:26.522,00:34:27.815,And then...
00:34:27.898,00:34:32.487,"and then now, you're both sitting on the bus at the end of the movie, both totally stoked, but wondering, like..."
00:34:36.491,00:34:38.493,Who invited the vampire?
00:34:38.576,00:34:39.910,Seriously?
00:34:45.666,00:34:46.959,What you just did for Alec...
00:34:47.042,00:34:49.129,"-I, um-- -It was the right thing to do."
00:34:57.303,00:34:58.638,There's no place for me here.
00:34:58.721,00:35:00.806,There's always gonna be a place for you here.
00:35:05.561,00:35:07.188,Give Alec and Magnus my best.
00:35:18.491,00:35:21.369,-Is Lydia gonna be okay? -She'll be all right.
00:35:26.874,00:35:28.751,"Look, Clary..."
00:35:28.834,00:35:32.130,"Listen, I just need to say that... you were right."
00:35:33.839,00:35:37.177,"Seeing what Alec just did, I realized I can't shut you out."
00:35:38.553,00:35:40.763,I just don't know what to do with all this.
00:35:42.097,00:35:45.643,"Much as this will shock Alec, my visit tonight wasn't all for him."
00:35:47.102,00:35:48.979,We need to speak privately.
00:35:57.572,00:36:00.908,I pulled every item of magical importance from Ragnor's belongings.
00:36:00.991,00:36:04.620,But I can't determine which will lead to the Book of the White.
00:36:04.704,00:36:05.788,"Wait, this bookmark."
00:36:10.543,00:36:11.877,It must have been the Book of the White.
00:36:13.213,00:36:15.548,we can use the bookmark to track the owner of the book.
00:36:16.090,00:36:17.383,Okay.
00:36:17.467,00:36:19.302,Warlock tracking is stronger.
00:36:33.191,00:36:36.068,"Well, there's good news and bad news."
00:36:36.151,00:36:39.154,The good news is I know the owner. The bad?
00:36:39.239,00:36:41.282,-It's Camille. -Camille?
00:36:41.366,00:36:44.327,Looks like Raphael has her locked up in the basement of the Hotel DuMort.
00:36:46.537,00:36:47.913,She won't have a choice.
00:36:49.123,00:36:50.416,Trust me.
00:37:31.123,00:37:32.583,"Why'd you ask me up here, Clary?"
00:37:33.709,00:37:35.253,I needed you to see this.
00:37:37.963,00:37:39.299,What is all that?
00:37:39.382,00:37:42.217,Luke told me that my mother had a son.
00:38:01.487,00:38:02.780,Jonathan Christopher.
00:38:03.656,00:38:05.700,-What's that? -It's my name.
00:38:08.202,00:38:09.495,J.C.
00:38:09.579,00:38:10.871,Jace.
00:38:11.872,00:38:13.541,Short for Jonathan Christopher.
00:38:13.624,00:38:17.878,"Jace, I know all of this is impossible to believe, but..."
00:38:18.879,00:38:21.006,our mother never abandoned you.
00:38:22.592,00:38:24.176,She thought you were dead.
00:38:24.259,00:38:27.262,"This is all she had left, and she..."
00:38:27.347,00:38:29.807,she carried you with her every single day.
00:38:30.558,00:38:32.226,Is all this really mine?
00:38:40.443,00:38:42.403,I don't know who I am anymore.
00:38:43.946,00:38:45.865,There's darkness in me.
00:38:47.199,00:38:50.786,It's always been there. And now I...
00:38:53.873,00:38:55.625,When we rescued Jocelyn...
00:38:57.335,00:38:58.961,and I let Valentine go...
00:39:00.880,00:39:03.298,I was tempted to go with him.
00:39:03.383,00:39:06.552,He's my father. Maybe that's where I belong.
00:39:06.636,00:39:07.678,Jace...
00:39:10.598,00:39:14.352,"I don't know how, but we are going to make sense of all this."
00:39:15.811,00:39:17.813,I promise.
00:39:22.818,00:39:26.447,I'm so glad we got away from that crowd and all those people.
00:39:26.531,00:39:27.865,So intense.
00:39:28.866,00:39:30.993,"I have to hand it to you, Alexander..."
00:39:39.669,00:39:41.671,"What have you done, Alec?"
00:39:42.296,00:39:44.632,-To us? This family? -This isn't about you.
00:39:44.715,00:39:48.469,Of course it is. You are either being selfish or naive.
00:39:50.513,00:39:53.891,And now you have humiliated us in front of the most respected members of the Clave.
00:39:54.809,00:39:56.394,I don't even recognize you anymore.
00:39:56.477,00:39:59.104,I'm the same person I've always been.
00:39:59.188,00:40:01.148,Now everything's just out in the open.
00:40:03.651,00:40:05.403,And all for a Downworlder.
00:40:09.782,00:40:10.950,Just give her time.
00:40:17.748,00:40:19.333,I don't really understand this.
00:40:23.087,00:40:25.756,How long has this been going on?
00:40:30.553,00:40:35.140,"No, it's... it's, uh, it's sort of a different... It's not-- It's all very new."
00:40:37.477,00:40:38.644,Right.
00:40:44.734,00:40:46.527,I better go check on Mom.
00:40:51.198,00:40:53.283,You know what I just realized?
00:40:53.367,00:40:55.410,We still haven't gone on our first date yet.
00:41:00.833,00:41:05.420,"You wanna... I don't know, get a drink sometime?"
00:41:07.047,00:41:08.382,I would love that.
00:41:11.552,00:41:13.554,Looks like we missed the wedding of the year.
00:41:14.346,00:41:15.681,It's all right.
00:41:16.724,00:41:19.810,You and I will be able to share our love openly one day.
00:41:25.816,00:41:29.111,"-How is she? -She's asleep, but she's home."
00:41:31.656,00:41:34.033,"-You okay, Hodge? -Yeah."
00:41:34.116,00:41:35.367,You should get some rest.
00:41:35.910,00:41:38.954,You've been so vigilant. Why don't you let me watch over her?
00:41:39.038,00:41:42.082,"-Thank you, my friend. -Of course."
00:41:43.250,00:41:44.919,-I'll see you tomorrow. -Yeah.
00:42:04.814,00:42:06.106,You have the Cup.
00:42:09.276,00:42:13.614,Help me break my Punishment rune... and I will bring it to you.
00:42:21.664,00:42:23.457,A deal is a deal.
00:00:11.511,00:00:13.846,Jonathan Christopher. JC. Jace.
00:00:13.930,00:00:15.265,I don't know who I am anymore.
00:00:15.348,00:00:16.599,There's darkness in me.
00:00:18.018,00:00:19.144,"a book of spells, and this was in it."
00:00:19.227,00:00:20.228,It must have been the Book of the White.
00:00:23.815,00:00:25.192,I want my property back.
00:00:25.275,00:00:27.027,Simon is not your property.
00:00:28.236,00:00:31.114,He's the evidence we need to show the Clave she's been breaking the Accords.
00:00:34.201,00:00:35.910,"This is about family, and tradition."
00:00:44.544,00:00:46.003,You have the Cup.
00:00:52.385,00:00:54.762,I spent a lifetime not knowing who I was.
00:00:54.846,00:00:58.058,"But, Jace, the one thing I know for sure is you are not a bad person."
00:00:59.016,00:01:00.560,You're not Valentine.
00:01:02.270,00:01:03.605,I should have killed him.
00:01:04.564,00:01:06.983,And yet I can't shake the feeling that he was right.
00:01:12.029,00:01:13.615,Jocelyn raised you.
00:01:13.698,00:01:16.993,"I was raised by Valentine, and a pair of baby booties isn't gonna change that."
00:01:17.077,00:01:18.495,Stop!
00:01:18.578,00:01:21.873,"Look, I can't even begin to explain what happened in our past, but our mom can."
00:01:22.540,00:01:24.126,We are so close to waking her up.
00:01:24.209,00:01:28.087,"You want answers as badly as I do, we have to go back to the Hotel DuMort and talk to Camille."
00:01:31.090,00:01:32.509,Fine. Where's Simon?
00:01:35.803,00:01:37.013,"Simon, wait!"
00:01:39.224,00:01:40.350,We need your help.
00:01:42.394,00:01:46.356,"It contains the spell that can wake my mom, but she hid it so Valentine can never find it."
00:01:49.776,00:01:51.153,The Bookmark of the White?
00:01:51.986,00:01:53.613,It's a piece of the book itself.
00:01:53.696,00:01:56.658,"Magnus tracked its owner to the Hotel DuMort, but..."
00:02:03.873,00:02:05.208,I'll set a meeting with Raphael.
00:02:05.750,00:02:06.793,Thank you.
00:02:13.841,00:02:17.179,Have you spoken with Lydia? No one's seen her since the wedding.
00:02:19.306,00:02:21.015,"-Mom, come on. -Maryse."
00:02:22.058,00:02:26.896,"Mom, I understand you're upset, but this is-- Calling off the wedding would've been one thing..."
00:02:33.486,00:02:34.696,You've embarrassed all of us.
00:02:34.779,00:02:37.324,-Why? Because he's a guy? -No.
00:02:37.407,00:02:41.453,"The fact that he is a guy, as you say, is the least of my worries."
00:02:43.621,00:02:44.914,Then what's the problem?
00:02:44.997,00:02:47.500,That you chose Magnus Bane.
00:02:47.584,00:02:49.336,His reputation precedes him.
00:02:49.419,00:02:52.214,"And even for a warlock, he's a bit of a lothario."
00:02:52.297,00:02:54.799,"Alec, there's so much that you don't know about him."
00:02:54.882,00:02:56.676,"Well, then I plan to get to know him."
00:02:56.759,00:02:59.804,"And if you have a problem with that, then I suggest you deal with it."
00:03:01.138,00:03:02.432,"Now, I have to go find Lydia."
00:03:02.515,00:03:07.937,She's probably packing for Idris in your father's office. What she did-- Saved my life.
00:03:09.314,00:03:10.982,So I should go thank her.
00:03:23.995,00:03:26.873,-how unpleasant was it? -Off the charts.
00:03:26.956,00:03:29.000,"Yeah, I've never seen them so angry."
00:03:30.543,00:03:32.545,Just give them some time.
00:03:32.629,00:03:35.215,You're immortal. Time is on your side.
00:03:35.298,00:03:38.218,After what I did... I don't think they'll ever forgive me.
00:03:39.261,00:03:41.513,Don't underestimate a parent's love.
00:03:43.723,00:03:45.225,"You don't regret it, do you?"
00:03:48.561,00:03:49.979,I didn't have time to think.
00:03:50.938,00:03:52.357,I just wanna make sure Lydia's okay.
00:03:52.440,00:03:54.066,Now I owe her so much.
00:03:54.150,00:03:55.985,We owe her.
00:03:56.068,00:03:57.945,What she did was nothing short of heroic.
00:04:00.240,00:04:03.034,"Hey, look, maybe we can slow things down?"
00:04:03.117,00:04:04.702,Why don't we start with that date you owe me?
00:04:09.416,00:04:12.960,I know this great Ethiopian place on 44th-- Lydia!
00:04:25.390,00:04:26.599,Go get help.
00:04:43.658,00:04:44.742,Better.
00:04:44.826,00:04:48.413,"Magnus is doing what he can to help her, but it's bad."
00:04:48.496,00:04:50.415,And the Cup is definitely missing.
00:04:52.584,00:04:53.960,"Maybe he was attacked, too."
00:04:58.590,00:05:00.758,No way. We've known him our entire lives.
00:05:18.860,00:05:20.069,I led him right to the Cup.
00:05:20.152,00:05:22.029,We treated him like family.
00:05:34.417,00:05:35.752,Looks like he's talking to someone.
00:05:38.546,00:05:39.714,And I can bet who it is.
00:05:39.797,00:05:41.048,Valentine.
00:05:41.799,00:05:45.970,"Well, that explains how he deactivated the Punishment rune, but it doesn't explain where he got the ring."
00:05:46.053,00:05:47.847,You think someone smuggled it past the wards?
00:05:49.516,00:05:51.726,Hodge wasn't the only ex-Circle member around here.
00:05:51.809,00:05:56.063,"Look, I know I don't always see eye to eye with my parents, but I know they're not traitors."
00:05:56.147,00:05:59.275,Really? Isn't that what you just said about Hodge?
00:06:00.568,00:06:04.739,"It'd have to be someone we trusted, but if there was an intruder inside the Institute, we would have found them by now."
00:06:04.822,00:06:05.990,What about the Forsaken attack?
00:06:06.073,00:06:09.035,"No. We killed that thing, and I didn't see a ring."
00:06:09.118,00:06:11.245,"He didn't have one during the autopsy, but..."
00:06:11.328,00:06:13.456,maybe there's something in the footage.
00:06:28.262,00:06:29.847,He was just the delivery boy.
00:06:29.931,00:06:33.643,"If he gives that Cup to Valentine, he'll create an army of Shadowhunters."
00:06:33.726,00:06:36.312,"With that kind of power behind him, he'll kill thousands."
00:06:36.395,00:06:38.773,He'll kill thousands just creating the army.
00:06:38.856,00:06:40.066,Most mundanes won't survive that.
00:06:40.149,00:06:41.317,We won't let that happen.
00:06:41.400,00:06:42.777,I'm gonna make sure of it.
00:07:09.428,00:07:11.514,I believe you have something that belongs to me.
00:07:13.808,00:07:14.976,As we agreed...
00:07:19.105,00:07:20.356,Oh.
00:07:22.108,00:07:23.776,"You've done well, Starkweather."
00:07:26.070,00:07:27.655,You have earned your freedom.
00:07:27.739,00:07:29.365,Thank you.
00:07:32.910,00:07:35.079,To see the outside world with my own eyes.
00:07:35.162,00:07:36.623,"Well, take it all in."
00:07:38.165,00:07:40.292,The world is about to change.
00:08:05.151,00:08:06.443,I'm ready.
00:08:08.738,00:08:10.031,Then drink.
00:08:26.130,00:08:27.298,Is he dead?
00:08:38.350,00:08:39.393,No.
00:08:53.658,00:08:54.867,He's a Shadowhunter.
00:09:07.964,00:09:09.423,"Jace, what are you doing?"
00:09:09.506,00:09:11.676,"Every second we waste here, Hodge gets closer to Valentine."
00:09:13.970,00:09:15.722,"I know you're mad right now, but Hodge could be dangerous."
00:09:15.805,00:09:18.099,"Two of us, one of him."
00:09:18.182,00:09:20.059,"Check the math, but I'm pretty sure he's outnumbered."
00:09:20.142,00:09:22.770,What is with you? Would you just talk to me for a second?
00:09:22.854,00:09:25.147,"Lydia, Hodge..."
00:09:27.609,00:09:30.027,"Jace, you cannot let emotions cloud your judgment."
00:09:30.820,00:09:32.154,"Your words, remember?"
00:09:32.905,00:09:35.449,"When I first wanted to find my mom, I didn't care about anyone else."
00:09:35.532,00:09:39.161,But you were the one that taught me that it's about a world that's bigger than us.
00:09:39.245,00:09:41.163,That's why you need to wake her up.
00:09:41.247,00:09:42.915,She was his prisoner...
00:09:42.999,00:09:44.792,and his wife.
00:09:44.876,00:09:48.129,"-If anyone can stop him, she can. -Jace, listen to me-- You can do this."
00:09:48.212,00:09:49.797,Maybe I can.
00:09:49.881,00:09:52.508,"But it's not about me, it's you I'm worried about."
00:09:52.592,00:09:54.927,You cannot let Valentine's evil poison you!
00:09:55.552,00:09:56.804,He's my father.
00:09:57.930,00:10:00.391,Actually... he's our father.
00:10:01.934,00:10:03.227,You don't get it.
00:10:11.568,00:10:14.405,How are we gonna find Hodge? He didn't leave anything we can track.
00:10:14.488,00:10:16.323,I might be able to ask Magnus for help.
00:10:16.407,00:10:18.868,"You need to stop thinking with your stele, Alec."
00:10:18.951,00:10:20.536,There's more than one way to track.
00:10:22.747,00:10:24.498,This is my fault.
00:10:24.581,00:10:26.042,"He walked right past me, Jace!"
00:10:27.001,00:10:31.881,"Yeah, if I'd have known-- Yeah, I'll be right there."
00:10:35.509,00:10:36.636,Hodge Starkweather.
00:10:36.719,00:10:37.887,Hunt him down.
00:10:37.970,00:10:39.847,I want him found and I want him alive.
00:11:06.415,00:11:08.000,but I expect something in return.
00:11:08.500,00:11:10.086,Jonathan and Clarissa...
00:11:11.045,00:11:12.088,find them.
00:11:16.092,00:11:20.096,What do you need Jace and Clary for? We already have the Cup.
00:11:21.848,00:11:22.974,We?
00:11:24.851,00:11:25.893,Yes.
00:11:25.977,00:11:28.395,"I promised you your freedom, Starkweather."
00:11:28.479,00:11:29.480,Nothing else.
00:11:32.859,00:11:35.694,You've only proven your willingness to betray it.
00:11:35.778,00:11:39.490,Do you really think that I would allow a traitor into my ranks?
00:11:42.034,00:11:43.285,I brought you the Cup.
00:11:43.369,00:11:45.788,You've served your purpose. Now you're free to go.
00:11:45.872,00:11:46.998,Free?
00:11:48.124,00:11:49.583,You promised me protection.
00:11:49.666,00:11:52.503,The Clave will never stop hunting me and you know that.
00:11:52.586,00:11:55.464,"Well, now that I have the Cup, the Clave's days are numbered."
00:11:56.173,00:11:57.466,I'm a man of my word.
00:11:58.217,00:12:02.388,The Clave will no longer bother you. And you will no longer bother me.
00:12:02.471,00:12:06.475,"Now, I suggest you enjoy your freedom before I change my mind."
00:12:13.607,00:12:16.693,"For Shadowhunters, you don't seem to do a lot of Shadowhunting."
00:12:20.489,00:12:22.241,We need to talk to Camille.
00:12:22.324,00:12:24.243,We know you have her here. We tracked her to the DuMort.
00:12:24.326,00:12:27.914,"It's true, but I'm afraid she's a bit tied up at the moment."
00:12:27.997,00:12:29.456,Is there something I can help you with?
00:12:34.378,00:12:36.255,but we have to let them talk to Camille.
00:12:36.338,00:12:39.383,She has a spell book that could wake up Jocelyn Fairchild.
00:12:39.466,00:12:42.094,Valentine might have the Cup. The entire Downworld's in danger.
00:12:42.178,00:12:44.096,She's far too dangerous.
00:12:44.180,00:12:46.640,Or did you already forget what happened last time you talked to her?
00:12:46.723,00:12:48.059,It's not like she can kill me again.
00:12:50.102,00:12:52.271,"if Valentine has the Cup, the entire Downworld is at risk."
00:12:52.354,00:12:53.605,Camille will only make things worse.
00:12:55.274,00:12:57.860,"I'll bring you what's left of Camille's things, but speaking to her is out of the question."
00:13:00.029,00:13:02.323,This isn't the kind of book she would've just left sitting around.
00:13:03.740,00:13:04.992,but that's the best I can do.
00:13:05.742,00:13:07.703,-We're supposed to be allies. -And we are.
00:13:07.786,00:13:10.747,But Shadowhunters have no business interfering with the Night Children's affairs.
00:13:10.832,00:13:14.085,"You may look to the Clave for justice, but the vampires look to me."
00:13:15.002,00:13:16.253,Camille stays where she is.
00:13:16.963,00:13:19.006,You're making a huge mistake.
00:13:48.995,00:13:50.204,Jace...
00:13:51.288,00:13:52.957,I'm afraid you're too late.
00:13:53.916,00:13:55.667,Valentine already has the Cup.
00:14:03.926,00:14:05.094,How could you?
00:14:11.350,00:14:12.518,I'd been caged long enough.
00:14:13.102,00:14:14.311,Caged?
00:14:14.395,00:14:16.063,You were our teacher.
00:14:16.147,00:14:18.190,We treated you like family. We loved you!
00:14:18.274,00:14:19.483,Family?
00:14:20.067,00:14:21.110,Family?
00:14:22.069,00:14:27.533,"The Lightwoods cut a deal, Jace, to have me punished for crimes that they themselves committed."
00:14:27.616,00:14:28.993,Don't you see?
00:14:30.077,00:14:31.287,I was their prisoner!
00:14:32.872,00:14:34.748,And besides...
00:14:39.170,00:14:40.754,I taught you everything you know.
00:14:42.965,00:14:44.633,"Not everything, Hodge."
00:15:36.518,00:15:38.062,-It's over! -It's not over.
00:15:38.145,00:15:39.646,He's a traitor. He deserves to pay.
00:15:41.983,00:15:43.775,"He sided with Valentine, Alec."
00:15:43.859,00:15:45.861,The Clave let him go once before and look where that got us.
00:15:45.945,00:15:47.113,What are you gonna do?
00:15:47.196,00:15:50.074,"You're gonna kill every ex-Circle member, even our parents?"
00:15:50.157,00:15:51.993,Robert and Maryse aren't my parents.
00:15:52.076,00:15:53.619,You said it yourself.
00:15:53.702,00:15:55.704,They raised you. They are your parents!
00:15:56.372,00:15:57.373,Just calm down.
00:15:57.456,00:16:00.626,There's a dungeon in Idris with your name written all over it.
00:16:29.113,00:16:30.739,"It's good to see you, Jonathan."
00:16:31.991,00:16:33.617,I've been expecting you.
00:16:37.997,00:16:39.915,I figured you'd find Starkweather.
00:16:40.416,00:16:41.667,I've trained you well.
00:16:43.919,00:16:45.629,I raised you.
00:16:45.712,00:16:47.923,"We're not so different, you and I."
00:16:50.176,00:16:52.094,Hodge had it coming.
00:16:52.178,00:16:54.346,You kill innocent people. I'd never do that.
00:16:54.430,00:16:55.431,Not yet.
00:16:56.348,00:16:57.724,But it's all a matter of time.
00:16:57.808,00:16:59.601,The Clave has failed us.
00:17:00.519,00:17:04.398,"They've failed all of humanity, but you knew that as well as I did."
00:17:05.441,00:17:08.735,"Every day, the demons get stronger, and soon..."
00:17:09.653,00:17:12.406,there won't be enough Shadowhunters to fight back.
00:17:13.740,00:17:15.367,The Cup can change that.
00:17:15.451,00:17:18.162,The Cup destroys more than it creates.
00:17:19.121,00:17:21.582,"Our job is to protect the mundanes, not to kill them."
00:17:22.374,00:17:25.752,"Well, losses are acceptable when the alternative is extinction."
00:17:27.213,00:17:28.589,But come with me.
00:17:29.506,00:17:33.094,Together we can use the Mortal Cup to save the world.
00:17:33.177,00:17:34.553,"Oh, I am coming for you."
00:17:34.636,00:17:36.930,We have unfinished business.
00:17:42.018,00:17:43.770,So these are all of Camille's things?
00:17:43.854,00:17:44.938,All I could find.
00:17:45.856,00:17:47.733,But she has hideouts all over the city.
00:17:48.442,00:17:49.943,Interesting.
00:17:50.026,00:17:51.653,I thought you were looking for a spell book.
00:17:53.197,00:17:54.240,We are.
00:17:54.323,00:17:55.366,We?
00:17:57.826,00:17:58.994,Where are your friends?
00:18:10.381,00:18:12.424,Give me a second. I gotta deal with this.
00:18:13.634,00:18:15.677,No one told me anything about a new prisoner.
00:18:15.761,00:18:19.390,That's because you're not advisor to the interim chapter president.
00:18:19.473,00:18:22.976,"I mean, you can take it up with Raphael if you want, but, uh, I wouldn't..."
00:18:23.059,00:18:25.729,wouldn't wanna tell you what happened to the last guy that challenged him.
00:18:28.524,00:18:29.691,Don't go anywhere.
00:18:39.951,00:18:40.994,No...
00:18:41.953,00:18:43.372,but I thought this would.
00:18:46.708,00:18:50.337,Typical Shadowhunter... always underestimating a vampire.
00:19:09.064,00:19:12.025,"By the time that vamp finds Raphael, we'll be long gone."
00:19:15.111,00:19:16.405,"If anyone catches us, we're dead."
00:19:16.488,00:19:17.906,Some of us already are.
00:19:20.451,00:19:23.329,"Alaric, we've got Hodge. Call off the rest of the pack."
00:19:24.330,00:19:25.831,We're gonna need a pickup.
00:19:27.416,00:19:30.126,We're at the subway station near Bergen.
00:19:30.211,00:19:32.087,Yeah. I'll see you in five.
00:19:34.465,00:19:36.467,-How's Hodge doing? -He'll live.
00:19:36.550,00:19:39.135,It's Jace I'm worried about. Valentine really messed with his head.
00:19:39.220,00:19:41.222,"-What, at Renwick's? -Yeah."
00:19:41.305,00:19:42.431,He went through a lot recently.
00:19:42.514,00:19:44.891,"I thought we had settled it, but something's killing him inside."
00:19:44.975,00:19:47.811,-I don't know what it is. -This is all too familiar.
00:19:47.894,00:19:50.146,I saw a similar thing with Valentine 18 years ago.
00:19:50.231,00:19:51.773,Jace isn't Valentine.
00:19:51.857,00:19:53.984,Not yet. We gotta keep an eye on him.
00:19:54.776,00:19:55.819,All right.
00:19:57.821,00:20:00.199,-Where'd they go? -What do you mean?
00:20:04.411,00:20:06.622,"Once we open this, there's no going back."
00:20:07.623,00:20:10.251,Everything we've done to unite the Downworld goes out the window.
00:20:10.334,00:20:14.087,"I wish there was another way, but if Valentine gets ahold of the Cup..."
00:20:15.046,00:20:16.673,there won't be a Downworld left to unite.
00:20:29.728,00:20:31.480,She's dead.
00:20:31.563,00:20:33.232,"Well, yeah. What'd you expect?"
00:20:36.860,00:20:38.111,Not so fast.
00:20:40.447,00:20:41.698,What took you so long?
00:20:42.949,00:20:44.075,Excuse me?
00:20:44.159,00:20:47.120,"I knew you'd come back for your sire, just like you did before."
00:20:50.081,00:20:51.458,How do you know I don't want to stake you?
00:20:52.042,00:20:53.084,Do you?
00:20:56.838,00:20:58.549,But that's not why we're here.
00:20:59.508,00:21:01.718,-Where's the Book of the White? -The book of the what?
00:21:01.802,00:21:03.554,"The Book of the White. Big, white spell book."
00:21:03.637,00:21:04.805,Kind of explains itself.
00:21:04.888,00:21:06.932,-Never heard of it. -And yet we tracked it to you.
00:21:07.015,00:21:10.686,Darling... what would I possibly want with a spell book?
00:21:13.480,00:21:15.441,"Okay, okay, okay."
00:21:15.524,00:21:17.108,You said it was a warlock book?
00:21:17.192,00:21:19.945,Yeah. I think my mom gave it to you.
00:21:20.028,00:21:21.112,She ran an antique store.
00:21:21.196,00:21:22.823,"Vampires sell that sort of stuff, right?"
00:21:22.906,00:21:24.283,All the time.
00:21:28.329,00:21:30.163,What about Dorothea Rollins?
00:21:31.247,00:21:32.458,She was my mom's assistant.
00:21:32.541,00:21:33.625,Dot?
00:21:33.709,00:21:36.378,"Oh, but of course."
00:21:36.462,00:21:37.879,She was our favorite customer.
00:21:39.047,00:21:42.301,So your entire life has been paid for by my antiquities.
00:21:43.259,00:21:44.886,I guess that means you owe me.
00:21:44.970,00:21:46.179,Do you know where it is or not?
00:21:47.138,00:21:49.558,It's in my apartment on the Upper East Side.
00:21:49.641,00:21:51.518,My own pied-à-terre.
00:21:51.602,00:21:53.019,I can take you there...
00:21:53.103,00:21:55.063,but you'll have to get me out of here first.
00:22:02.112,00:22:04.030,Totally up to you.
00:22:12.789,00:22:14.333,Go help Clary.
00:22:16.001,00:22:17.878,"Whatever Valentine's telling you, it's not true."
00:22:17.961,00:22:19.713,"That's just it, Alec."
00:22:19.796,00:22:21.465,It is true.
00:22:21.548,00:22:22.591,He's my father.
00:22:22.674,00:22:24.843,He taught me how to fight. Not to be weak.
00:22:24.926,00:22:27.388,You can't let him control you like this. This isn't you!
00:22:27.471,00:22:28.514,It is me.
00:22:29.473,00:22:30.891,It's always been me.
00:22:31.892,00:22:33.644,He raised me to be a killer.
00:22:34.936,00:22:36.605,Now I'm gonna make him regret it.
00:22:39.566,00:22:41.485,"-She needs you. -No. No. No, no."
00:22:41.568,00:22:42.986,You don't have to do this. All right?
00:22:55.832,00:22:58.168,Why don't you ask him yourself?
00:22:58.251,00:22:59.335,I saw you take the ring.
00:22:59.420,00:23:00.879,And walk into a trap?
00:23:02.130,00:23:03.256,I don't think so.
00:23:07.594,00:23:09.262,Tell me what I need to know...
00:23:10.138,00:23:12.599,or you're gonna lose the other hand...
00:23:12.683,00:23:13.892,one finger at a time.
00:23:27.405,00:23:28.949,Where's Valentine?
00:23:39.334,00:23:42.170,No problem. We'll go downstairs and take the tunnels out. Come on.
00:23:42.253,00:23:43.464,Going somewhere?
00:23:45.841,00:23:46.925,You should have stayed put.
00:23:49.427,00:23:50.637,I'm disappointed in you.
00:23:54.975,00:23:56.935,Our alliance is finished.
00:23:57.644,00:24:02.398,"The Accords may prohibit killing mundanes, but they say nothing about sunburned vampires."
00:24:02.983,00:24:06.236,Simon's betrayed us... just as Camille did.
00:24:06.778,00:24:08.238,They deserve the same fate.
00:24:35.641,00:24:37.518,always underestimating a Shadowhunter.
00:24:39.936,00:24:41.021,Adios.
00:24:48.695,00:24:50.531,But you didn't. We got you out.
00:24:50.614,00:24:52.240,"Technically, I got you out."
00:24:52.323,00:24:54.868,"Noted. Now, tell us where the book is."
00:24:54.951,00:24:59.581,"Patience, my dear-- Enough! Just because we got you out doesn't mean I won't kill you right here."
00:24:59.665,00:25:02.543,"There's still one more thing I require of, um..."
00:25:03.960,00:25:05.045,Simon.
00:25:07.548,00:25:08.924,What the hell is that?
00:25:09.007,00:25:12.135,A document stating you asked her to turn you into a vampire.
00:25:12.218,00:25:14.470,"Signed and sealed in your blood, of course."
00:25:14.555,00:25:16.264,Haven't you had enough of my blood?
00:25:17.599,00:25:21.144,And I definitely don't want the Clave to falsely accuse me of killing mundanes.
00:25:21.227,00:25:23.104,You want Simon to pardon you?
00:25:23.188,00:25:24.272,No way.
00:25:24.355,00:25:25.982,You killed Simon.
00:25:26.066,00:25:28.276,The least we could do is return the favor.
00:25:28.359,00:25:34.157,"And yet... the second I go up in smoke, so does any hope of you finding your precious book."
00:25:36.367,00:25:37.410,It's okay.
00:25:40.330,00:25:42.708,"So where do we get this document, huh?"
00:25:42.791,00:25:45.126,I can't imagine you have many friends left.
00:25:45.210,00:25:46.795,I know a guy.
00:25:52.676,00:25:55.762,"So, Magnus, how long has it been?"
00:25:55.846,00:25:58.640,One hundred? One hundred fifty years?
00:25:58.724,00:26:02.060,"One hundred and thirty-eight. Oddly, I haven't missed you."
00:26:03.353,00:26:04.646,"Of course you have, my love."
00:26:04.730,00:26:06.857,"All right, you two can catch up later."
00:26:06.940,00:26:08.274,"Right now, we need to find the Book of the White."
00:26:08.358,00:26:11.027,"And you will, but not without payment."
00:26:11.945,00:26:13.655,You of all people should understand that.
00:26:15.490,00:26:16.908,And what is it you require?
00:26:16.992,00:26:17.993,A clean slate.
00:26:18.076,00:26:20.036,She wants a Writ of Turning-Me-Into-A-Vampire.
00:26:20.120,00:26:21.287,And we need you to draft it.
00:26:21.371,00:26:23.749,Hmm. I thought I was done with you.
00:26:23.832,00:26:26.126,We'll never be done with each other.
00:26:28.712,00:26:30.296,I'm gonna call for backup.
00:26:32.841,00:26:34.676,"Simon, can I talk to you for a minute?"
00:26:36.678,00:26:37.888,You don't have to go through with this.
00:26:37.971,00:26:41.767,"If you want to go out there and stake Camille through the heart, I will hold her down while you do it."
00:26:45.186,00:26:46.772,I don't even care about that anymore.
00:26:47.689,00:26:50.441,Nothing matters but Jocelyn. We have to wake her up.
00:26:58.659,00:27:00.786,Remember when she got me that sealed copy of Battletoads?
00:27:04.497,00:27:06.166,She just wanted to watch us play.
00:27:09.002,00:27:10.628,"But Simon, Camille's dangerous."
00:27:11.546,00:27:14.424,"If you sign this thing, we'll just be setting her free to kill again."
00:27:14.507,00:27:15.676,No.
00:27:15.759,00:27:17.468,She's not half as bad as Valentine.
00:27:17.552,00:27:19.012,Your mom beat him once.
00:27:24.350,00:27:27.062,But... we have to at least find out.
00:27:27.145,00:27:29.189,I guess it's not just me that needs my mom.
00:27:30.816,00:27:32.025,It's all of us.
00:27:39.157,00:27:42.618,You're still upset by my dalliance with that short-lived Russian?
00:27:42.703,00:27:44.955,Upset? No.
00:27:48.458,00:27:49.625,Love is fleeting.
00:27:50.543,00:27:52.253,Even more so when you're immortal.
00:27:52.337,00:27:54.297,And yet true love cannot die.
00:27:54.380,00:27:55.465,But people can.
00:27:55.548,00:27:58.176,People are more than just toys for your amusement.
00:27:58.259,00:28:00.470,Hundreds of years old and still so naive.
00:28:01.304,00:28:04.015,You wouldn't know what to do with love if you found it.
00:28:11.231,00:28:13.233,Or do you think you already have?
00:28:19.155,00:28:20.198,Angel blood.
00:28:30.125,00:28:31.167,Where's the book?
00:28:32.252,00:28:33.294,It's complicated.
00:28:35.130,00:28:36.214,I have it.
00:28:37.132,00:28:39.675,And she's graciously offered it in exchange for her freedom.
00:28:39.760,00:28:42.053,And her freedom requires a lip-lock?
00:28:43.554,00:28:45.473,We don't negotiate with prisoners.
00:28:47.308,00:28:48.518,I beg to disagree.
00:28:51.687,00:28:52.814,You need me.
00:28:54.607,00:28:57.277,"You certainly have a type, don't you, Magnus?"
00:28:57.360,00:28:58.779,He's cute.
00:29:00.155,00:29:02.991,Say that again... you won't last.
00:29:03.074,00:29:05.827,I'd say he's about 20 years from male pattern baldness.
00:29:05.911,00:29:07.954,I don't have time for this. Where's Clary?
00:29:14.460,00:29:16.462,"Alec, did you find Hodge?"
00:29:16.546,00:29:18.965,"Yeah, but Valentine has the Cup."
00:29:19.049,00:29:20.175,What?
00:29:21.217,00:29:22.302,We're too late.
00:29:23.053,00:29:24.095,Where's Jace? Is he okay?
00:29:24.179,00:29:26.222,He went after Valentine by himself.
00:29:26.306,00:29:27.808,It's like he's totally lost it.
00:29:27.891,00:29:29.392,"I tried to stop him, but he wouldn't listen."
00:29:29.475,00:29:31.102,We need to find Jace.
00:29:31.186,00:29:33.313,He's in a dark place. We don't know what he's gonna do.
00:29:35.273,00:29:37.483,Jace wants us to stay on mission.
00:29:39.694,00:29:41.362,We have to wake up your mom.
00:29:42.322,00:29:44.157,It's our only way to stop Valentine.
00:29:46.076,00:29:47.285,Ready to sign?
00:29:47.368,00:29:51.414,"Take us to the apartment, give us the book, then you can have your pardon."
00:29:59.380,00:30:00.841,I wouldn't have it any other way.
00:30:01.507,00:30:02.550,Good.
00:30:11.559,00:30:12.727,-Where is he? -He was here.
00:30:25.240,00:30:26.992,"Ah, Jonathan."
00:30:28.034,00:30:29.953,To what do I owe this surprise?
00:30:30.661,00:30:31.997,I've reconsidered your offer.
00:30:32.080,00:30:35.291,"First you want to kill me, then you want to join me."
00:30:35.375,00:30:37.377,"Seems a bit convenient, don't you think?"
00:30:38.253,00:30:40.713,-Do you want to meet me or not? -Yes.
00:30:44.634,00:30:46.136,'Cause I've taught you better than this.
00:30:46.219,00:30:49.597,Always strike where your opponent is vulnerable.
00:30:50.306,00:30:53.351,"See, fighting you directly could prove... difficult."
00:30:54.269,00:30:55.311,But your friends...
00:30:55.979,00:30:58.314,"Well, your friends are a different matter."
00:31:07.949,00:31:10.118,"You've reached Clary's phone. I'm not here, but you know the deal."
00:31:10.201,00:31:11.577,-Damn it. Where are you? -Leave one at the beep.
00:31:11.661,00:31:13.955,"Clary, call me as soon as you get this."
00:31:35.185,00:31:37.520,I thought the underground parking was nice.
00:31:41.900,00:31:43.401,Wow. You've got a lot of books.
00:31:43.484,00:31:45.028,I've got a lot of time on my hands.
00:31:45.111,00:31:46.779,"Welcome home, Madame Belcourt."
00:31:49.449,00:31:51.451,-Let's check the perimeter. -Good idea.
00:31:56.206,00:31:58.666,Why do you have this place if you live at Hotel DuMort?
00:31:58.749,00:32:00.543,The DuMort has too many rules.
00:32:00.626,00:32:02.378,Think of it like Gracie Mansion.
00:32:02.462,00:32:05.006,"It's the official residence, but it doesn't mean I have to live there."
00:32:10.303,00:32:11.387,proclivities.
00:32:11.471,00:32:13.098,"You know, the mayor has the same problem."
00:32:13.181,00:32:14.474,Ow!
00:32:14.557,00:32:15.641,Hey.
00:32:15.725,00:32:16.977,Come with me.
00:32:22.440,00:32:23.524,On the dotted line.
00:32:36.621,00:32:37.705,Thank you.
00:32:41.751,00:32:43.128,I'd love to...
00:32:48.924,00:32:50.218,I have no idea where it is.
00:32:50.301,00:32:51.844,Dot gave it to you.
00:32:51.927,00:32:53.346,I'm sure it's here somewhere.
00:32:53.429,00:32:56.682,"But if the idea was to hide it, telling me would defeat the purpose."
00:32:58.768,00:33:00.936,So we have to search the whole apartment?
00:33:01.021,00:33:02.022,See?
00:33:02.105,00:33:03.648,That's the spirit.
00:33:03.731,00:33:06.817,Although I'd start now. I've got four more rooms just like this one.
00:33:12.948,00:33:13.992,"Good-bye, Simon."
00:33:14.075,00:33:15.994,It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
00:33:16.077,00:33:18.871,"-Wait. -I wish I could, my little caramel."
00:33:18.954,00:33:20.040,But don't worry...
00:33:20.581,00:33:21.874,we'll see each other soon.
00:33:24.794,00:33:26.087,Jace? Are you okay?
00:33:26.171,00:33:29.257,"-Where are you? -At Camille's apartment, Upper East Side."
00:33:29.340,00:33:30.675,"Alucard building, 13th floor."
00:33:30.758,00:33:32.593,You're in danger. Valentine's probably already on the way.
00:33:32.677,00:33:33.719,"You need to leave, now."
00:33:33.803,00:33:35.221,We are so close to finding the Book of the White.
00:33:35.305,00:33:36.389,I'm not leaving without it.
00:33:36.472,00:33:37.682,"Clary, you need to leave!"
00:33:37.765,00:33:39.225,"You said yourself, we have to stay on mission."
00:33:39.309,00:33:40.893,You need to leave now.
00:33:42.770,00:33:44.855,Clary. Clary!
00:33:45.815,00:33:47.442,Damn it.
00:33:52.447,00:33:54.824,Maybe she did. Did she ever say anything about a book?
00:33:56.451,00:33:59.204,"And if she did, she erased my memory of anything to do with the Shadow World."
00:33:59.287,00:34:01.372,"Well, there's got to be something."
00:34:01.456,00:34:03.833,"Maybe the clue has something to do with color, you know?"
00:34:03.916,00:34:07.587,"White is the absence of color, so... Or is that black?"
00:34:07.670,00:34:09.505,"Simon, just let me think for a second."
00:34:09.589,00:34:10.631,"Clary, that's a cookbook."
00:34:10.715,00:34:12.133,I've seen this before.
00:34:12.217,00:34:15.053,"Chicken cacciatore, remember? My mom used to make it all the time."
00:34:15.136,00:34:17.347,How could I forget? Even better the next day.
00:34:17.430,00:34:19.432,The gift that keeps on giving. It's...
00:34:48.378,00:34:50.421,We gotta go. He's here.
00:34:59.264,00:35:00.973,Clarissa.
00:35:03.184,00:35:05.186,So good to see you again.
00:35:09.064,00:35:11.192,-Where's your brother? -You think I'd tell you?
00:35:11.276,00:35:12.485,You won't have to.
00:35:12.568,00:35:13.861,Stay away from her!
00:35:21.786,00:35:22.953,This time you're not getting away.
00:35:29.294,00:35:30.670,Finally ready to kill your own father?
00:35:30.753,00:35:32.255,You abandoned me.
00:35:32.338,00:35:33.631,I was protecting you.
00:35:33.714,00:35:35.508,"You weren't ready then, but you've grown."
00:35:35.591,00:35:38.052,You've become the warrior I've trained you to be.
00:35:38.594,00:35:39.637,You trained me well.
00:35:40.513,00:35:43.724,"And yet, I still have so much to teach you."
00:35:44.475,00:35:45.810,I brought you here for a reason.
00:35:47.437,00:35:50.440,"Look, fight me, and watch your friends die."
00:36:01.326,00:36:04.162,You can have the book. We won't be able to stop you without it.
00:36:08.916,00:36:12.628,Willing to do anything for those that you love.
00:36:12.712,00:36:16.341,"I'm touched, but... the book was never part of my plan."
00:36:17.425,00:36:19.594,I want you to wake up your mother.
00:36:20.595,00:36:22.805,I know that you'll both join me eventually.
00:36:24.932,00:36:26.642,It's fated.
00:36:29.354,00:36:30.396,You ready?
00:36:45.953,00:36:47.288,If I go with you...
00:36:48.206,00:36:49.832,promise me you won't hurt them.
00:36:50.458,00:36:51.751,You have my word.
00:36:52.752,00:36:53.878,This is insane.
00:36:54.587,00:36:55.671,"I'm sorry, Clary."
00:36:55.755,00:36:56.964,Jace...
00:36:57.965,00:36:59.425,what are you doing?
00:37:00.760,00:37:01.844,You can't be serious!
00:37:07.600,00:37:09.644,"You don't know that, Clary. You don't know that."
00:37:12.563,00:37:13.731,Let them go.
00:37:17.485,00:37:19.820,"-Simon... -Get back, get back."
00:37:19.904,00:37:21.781,"Alec, I mean it."
00:37:25.743,00:37:26.827,Jace...
00:37:40.800,00:37:43.719,-What are you doing? -Saving your life.
00:37:43.803,00:37:48.098,"If you enter a Portal not knowing where you're going, you'll be stuck in limbo forever."
00:38:19.339,00:38:21.131,"At least we got Hodge, right?"
00:38:25.511,00:38:26.554,Clary?
00:38:27.262,00:38:28.889,We have to find Jace.
00:38:29.640,00:38:31.266,He thinks Valentine did something to him.
00:38:32.226,00:38:34.228,"Raised him to be evil, but..."
00:38:35.813,00:38:38.273,But I know Jace. He's good.
00:38:38.358,00:38:41.444,He's tough. He can handle himself.
00:38:41.527,00:38:42.737,Besides...
00:38:43.654,00:38:48.534,"knowing Jace, I give it a week before Valentine's Simon, not now."
00:38:50.411,00:38:51.454,We'll save him.
00:38:51.537,00:38:55.750,"What Valentine told Jace about his friends making him weak, that was wrong."
00:38:57.167,00:38:58.378,Love makes us stronger.
00:38:58.461,00:39:00.129,You saved me from the vampires.
00:39:01.046,00:39:03.215,"Without you and Jace, I wouldn't be here."
00:39:04.509,00:39:05.551,We'll save him.
00:39:06.093,00:39:08.262,-I promise. -Thank you.
00:39:10.431,00:39:12.224,"Whatever you do, don't lose hope."
00:39:13.893,00:39:15.770,"I love you, Clary."
00:39:18.481,00:39:20.190,"I love you, too, Simon."
00:39:27.573,00:39:30.535,"I know you don't want to hear it, so I'll just say it once."
00:39:31.494,00:39:34.079,"Whatever I felt for Camille, it's ancient history."
00:39:35.039,00:39:36.290,Almost literally.
00:39:37.332,00:39:40.753,"Yeah, but what she said about you being immortal... she's right."
00:39:44.465,00:39:45.508,Alexander...
00:39:46.426,00:39:50.680,"I may be the High Warlock of Brooklyn, but... even I can't see the future."
00:39:55.309,00:39:57.437,Good. We need the space.
00:39:57.520,00:39:59.397,Jocelyn's spell is very powerful.
00:40:08.698,00:40:10.533,Do you really think this is gonna work?
00:40:11.451,00:40:13.077,Let us hope.
00:40:44.650,00:40:45.693,I got you.
00:40:46.360,00:40:47.487,Luke.
00:41:05.963,00:41:07.381,Oh...
00:41:08.799,00:41:11.511,I'm so sorry I didn't tell you about your past.
00:41:11.594,00:41:14.429,"No, not now. I have had enough for one day."
00:41:14.514,00:41:16.181,We can talk about all that later.
00:41:17.642,00:41:18.976,"Right now, I just..."
00:41:19.894,00:41:21.353,I just really need my mom.
00:41:31.155,00:41:32.657,and my son!
00:41:34.074,00:41:35.993,Pledge me your loyalty!
00:41:37.495,00:41:38.663,Together...
00:41:39.371,00:41:45.002,we can preserve our race and rid the world of the demons who plague it.
00:41:45.878,00:41:49.674,You are the chosen ones.
00:41:50.340,00:41:53.928,The new breed of Shadowhunters!
00:00:11.094,00:00:13.513,The Cup is not safe here. We have to give it back to the Clave.
00:00:13.596,00:00:16.558,This Cup is the one chance I have at getting my mom back.
00:00:16.641,00:00:18.685,-What's happening? -Looks like someone's trying to break in.
00:00:21.313,00:00:22.314,"Oh, my God, Simon!"
00:00:22.397,00:00:25.400,The Clave has ordered me to take temporary control of this Institute.
00:00:25.483,00:00:27.277,There is a way to bring Simon back.
00:00:27.360,00:00:28.778,-Alive and breathing? -That's just it.
00:00:31.781,00:00:33.991,I've done everything for my parents...
00:00:34.076,00:00:36.078,Maybe you should start living for yourself.
00:00:36.786,00:00:39.414,-What do you want? -I want my property back.
00:00:39.497,00:00:42.959,"Lydia Branwell... will you marry me, Alec Lightwood?"
00:00:43.042,00:00:44.586,Drink up.
00:00:45.503,00:00:47.255,I'm nothing more than a monster.
00:00:56.806,00:00:58.391,Where do you think you're going?
00:00:58.475,00:00:59.892,I don't know.
00:01:04.564,00:01:06.858,"I can see my reflection, does that mean I'm not..."
00:01:06.941,00:01:09.694,not... one of you?
00:01:10.362,00:01:11.696,You have a lot to learn.
00:01:14.407,00:01:16.201,-Listen... -Don't touch me!
00:01:16.284,00:01:17.952,I don't have a heartbeat! I'm dead.
00:01:18.035,00:01:19.329,Undead.
00:01:19.412,00:01:20.788,You did this to me.
00:01:20.872,00:01:23.040,"-No, I didn't. -You're a monster!"
00:01:27.170,00:01:29.506,"Look, you gotta get this under control."
00:01:29.589,00:01:30.965,You are what you are now.
00:01:31.048,00:01:32.550,We'll get you back to the Hotel DuMort.
00:01:32.634,00:01:35.303,Get you fed. Show you around your new home.
00:01:36.012,00:01:38.097,That place will never be my home.
00:02:00.412,00:02:02.580,"I swear, if that kid ruins one more jacket..."
00:02:02.664,00:02:04.081,Where is he?
00:02:05.667,00:02:07.835,-You said you'd look after him. -I can't do that until he's ready.
00:02:07.919,00:02:09.504,What does that even mean?
00:02:12.089,00:02:13.300,His own personal hell.
00:02:15.635,00:02:17.845,"If it helps, he doesn't even remember it was you."
00:02:17.929,00:02:20.515,Those first minutes... a complete blank.
00:02:20.598,00:02:25.895,"-But I have to tell him the truth. -Once you rein him in, he'll be walking, talking proof to the Clave that Camille broke the Accords."
00:02:28.898,00:02:31.151,I don't care about your vampire politics!
00:02:31.234,00:02:32.694,We have to find Simon.
00:02:32.777,00:02:34.321,"-We will. -He's out there, he's alone..."
00:02:34.404,00:02:36.448,scared... he's hungry.
00:02:36.531,00:02:38.866,Give me a call when he turns up.
00:02:48.000,00:02:49.502,Getting reinforcements.
00:02:52.214,00:02:55.132,I'm not. It doesn't even hurt.
00:03:01.806,00:03:03.516,No talking... just healing.
00:03:11.733,00:03:13.067,We need you.
00:03:13.150,00:03:15.362,-There's been an attack at the Institute. -An attack?
00:03:15.445,00:03:18.072,Valentine created a Forsaken that went through the wards.
00:03:18.155,00:03:20.533,"That's not possible, Izzy. Nothing can get through the wards."
00:03:20.617,00:03:23.370,They're... They're warlock spells to defend against all Downworlders.
00:03:23.453,00:03:26.748,Not this one. It had Seelie blood with angel properties.
00:03:26.831,00:03:30.084,"-Jace, it went after Hodge and Alec. -Are they okay?"
00:03:30.167,00:03:32.337,"-Is Alec-- -They're banged up, but they'll live."
00:03:32.420,00:03:33.421,Hodge killed it.
00:03:33.505,00:03:35.257,-It was after the-- -The Cup.
00:03:35.340,00:03:36.883,"Izzy, I'll be there as soon as I can."
00:03:47.394,00:03:48.603,Alec's injured.
00:03:51.231,00:03:52.649,-Simon's in danger-- -So what about Alec?
00:03:52.732,00:03:54.025,"It's not safe out here, Clary."
00:03:54.108,00:03:57.695,"Okay, did you forget how I single-handedly battled a Shax demon to protect the Cup?"
00:04:04.327,00:04:05.787,You're right.
00:04:09.165,00:04:10.583,Don't get used to it.
00:04:11.959,00:04:13.795,"Look, maybe Luke can help you find Simon."
00:04:13.878,00:04:16.005,Werewolves are really great trackers.
00:04:19.175,00:04:21.052,"Just promise me you'll be careful, okay?"
00:04:25.973,00:04:28.142,"-Jace, we still have to talk about-- -Us."
00:04:51.833,00:04:54.085,Are the wards solid now? Nothing will get through?
00:04:55.837,00:04:57.380,Even my magic has limits.
00:04:57.464,00:05:00.925,The wards won't hold off that Forsaken attack.
00:05:01.008,00:05:03.553,But my protections will slow them down.
00:05:03.636,00:05:05.430,Extra time is priceless.
00:05:05.513,00:05:07.890,No... say that after you get my bill.
00:05:07.974,00:05:09.434,Lydia will take care of that.
00:05:13.771,00:05:16.649,A Forsaken wound often needs a little warlock TLC.
00:05:16.733,00:05:18.025,"May I? Uh, free of charge."
00:05:18.109,00:05:20.027,It's okay.
00:05:20.111,00:05:21.321,I'm fine.
00:05:21.404,00:05:24.156,-If anything were to happen to you-- -Magnus...
00:05:24.240,00:05:25.867,I'm good.
00:05:25.950,00:05:28.495,-All right? I gotta-- -Go?
00:05:31.414,00:05:33.875,And I should find this Lydia person.
00:05:36.378,00:05:38.713,-Where might I find her? -I haven't seen her.
00:05:38.796,00:05:40.590,"But if I do, I'll send her your way."
00:05:47.847,00:05:48.848,Meliorn?
00:05:49.849,00:05:51.017,What are you doing here?
00:05:51.100,00:05:53.603,The Clave called me in for some kind of conference.
00:05:57.690,00:06:00.818,Your fire message clearly stated you never wanted to see me again.
00:06:00.902,00:06:02.987,-My family-- -Despises Downworlders?
00:06:03.070,00:06:05.072,-That's common knowledge. -That's not true.
00:06:05.156,00:06:07.950,"And even if it were, I'm not like that."
00:06:08.785,00:06:10.369,I'm not here to talk about us.
00:06:11.954,00:06:13.498,I believe that's your Clave envoy.
00:06:14.541,00:06:16.167,"Isabelle, please step aside."
00:06:18.920,00:06:20.422,-What? -What for?
00:06:20.505,00:06:24.592,Soliciting state secrets from a Shadowhunter on behalf of Valentine Morgenstern.
00:06:29.972,00:06:31.808,-Have you lost your mind? -Me?
00:06:31.891,00:06:34.060,You're lucky you weren't arrested along with him.
00:06:34.143,00:06:36.020,What are you talking about?
00:06:36.103,00:06:41.901,"It's our understanding that your long-standing relationship with the Seelie, Meliorn, may have led to the disclosure of state secrets."
00:06:41.984,00:06:43.110,What? No!
00:06:43.194,00:06:47.156,Meliorn told me how to get into the Hotel DuMort so that we could save a mundane.
00:06:47.239,00:06:48.825,And you told him nothing in return?
00:06:50.367,00:06:52.078,Nobody is blaming you for the attack.
00:06:52.161,00:06:55.164,Meliorn and the Seelies were likely working with Valentine all along.
00:06:56.332,00:07:00.503,Valentine has been murdering Downworlders and draining their bodies for months.
00:07:00.587,00:07:05.592,He probably killed those Seelie scouts and used their blood-- -Do you have proof? -Do you?
00:07:05.675,00:07:06.801,I have orders.
00:07:06.884,00:07:09.220,That's all. I never wanted any of this.
00:07:09.303,00:07:12.515,I don't believe you for a second.
00:07:15.267,00:07:16.978,Simon is gonna hate me.
00:07:17.061,00:07:18.730,"Luke, I did a terrible thing."
00:07:18.813,00:07:20.189,It can't be undone.
00:07:20.272,00:07:22.525,"I found my way back, your mother helped me."
00:07:22.609,00:07:26.446,When he understands that you're there for him-- But how could he know that if we can't find him?
00:07:28.906,00:07:35.788,"She calls Meliorn in and arrests him, You're gonna hurt yourself."
00:07:37.206,00:07:39.125,"I'm Fine, Izzy."
00:07:39.208,00:07:40.627,"It was the Clave that gave the order, not Lydia."
00:07:40.710,00:07:41.961,Are you sure about that?
00:07:43.379,00:07:46.215,Hey. You all right?
00:07:48.300,00:07:49.927,They're being sent back to Idris.
00:07:50.011,00:07:51.721,-What? -Yeah.
00:07:51.804,00:07:53.014,Another order from Lydia?
00:07:53.765,00:07:56.142,-Who's Lydia? -She's in charge of the Institute.
00:07:56.225,00:07:58.310,-She's what? -Temporarily.
00:07:58.394,00:08:01.230,And now she's convinced the Clave that Mom and Dad aren't doing their job?
00:08:01.313,00:08:02.356,"Well, maybe they aren't."
00:08:02.940,00:08:05.234,The Institute was under their control when the Forsaken got in.
00:08:06.569,00:08:08.362,Mom and Dad were members of the Circle.
00:08:11.491,00:08:13.993,That's because they made a deal with the Clave prior to the Uprising.
00:08:14.076,00:08:16.954,"In exchange for their cooperation, they were pardoned."
00:08:17.038,00:08:18.748,You're questioning their loyalty?
00:08:20.207,00:08:21.709,The Circle is rising.
00:08:24.003,00:08:25.547,Robert and Maryse took me in.
00:08:25.630,00:08:28.633,They raised me as one of their own. I know what kind of people they are.
00:08:28.716,00:08:31.177,Are you sure? They lied to us.
00:08:31.260,00:08:32.762,"For years, they've been telling us how to act."
00:08:32.845,00:08:36.724,"That we have to uphold the Lightwood name. Well, they're the ones who tarnished it."
00:08:36.808,00:08:37.850,They're hypocrites.
00:08:37.934,00:08:40.144,You must be Jace Wayland.
00:08:41.979,00:08:45.107,Lydia Branwell. You're quite the legend back in Idris.
00:08:46.943,00:08:48.444,Don't believe everything you hear.
00:08:48.528,00:08:49.862,Did you tell them?
00:08:49.946,00:08:51.030,Tell us what?
00:08:52.323,00:08:53.575,Lydia and I are engaged.
00:08:54.742,00:08:55.868,We're getting married.
00:08:58.120,00:08:59.747,You're not serious.
00:08:59.831,00:09:01.165,You were supposed to tell them no.
00:09:02.458,00:09:04.418,It's your life to ruin.
00:09:08.005,00:09:09.549,Not sure what to say.
00:09:09.632,00:09:11.593,"How about, None of this matters?"
00:09:12.509,00:09:14.929,-We have to stop Valentine. -Finally.
00:09:15.012,00:09:16.848,Something we agree on.
00:09:31.320,00:09:33.030,"Oh, thank God."
00:09:33.114,00:09:34.824,"God, where have you been?"
00:09:36.200,00:09:37.201,Mom.
00:09:40.037,00:09:41.789,I'm really happy to see you.
00:09:41.873,00:09:44.166,"Yeah, you and me both."
00:09:46.293,00:09:47.587,You can't worry me like that.
00:09:47.670,00:09:51.799,"Clary said you were okay, but I just kept picturing you dead in a ditch somewhere."
00:09:53.175,00:09:55.678,I don't know what I'd do if anything happened to you.
00:09:55.762,00:09:58.681,"Please, just call me next time and let me know."
00:10:12.904,00:10:14.656,"-Hi, Mrs. Lewis. -Hi."
00:10:15.740,00:10:17.366,"Oh, are you all right?"
00:10:19.493,00:10:21.996,Doesn't he look so pale to you?
00:10:29.086,00:10:31.422,"Okay, someone needs to tell me what is going on here."
00:10:39.847,00:10:41.265,Do for me.
00:10:46.562,00:10:48.898,"Apparently, I am not Clary Fray."
00:10:53.027,00:10:57.031,"Clary, I don't think he's well enough to go-- Simon, we have always been here for each other."
00:11:00.993,00:11:02.244,I don't know.
00:11:03.120,00:11:04.330,"You know what, Clary? I think maybe another time."
00:11:04.413,00:11:06.290,Simon...
00:11:06.373,00:11:09.126,I need you to help me through this.
00:11:18.260,00:11:19.887,"Are you sure, baby?"
00:11:28.813,00:11:30.439,You take care of my boy.
00:11:31.899,00:11:33.317,You know how much he means to me.
00:11:35.987,00:11:37.363,"Okay, we should really go."
00:11:38.990,00:11:40.157,"I'll see you later, Mom."
00:11:40.241,00:11:42.076,I'm holding you to that.
00:11:42.159,00:11:48.082,"And when you come home, you and I are gonna have a serious discussion about what's going on with you."
00:11:50.626,00:11:52.044,Love you.
00:11:54.505,00:11:56.090,"I love you, too."
00:12:00.386,00:12:03.555,Were you planning on telling us about your engagement before we left for Idris?
00:12:05.307,00:12:07.810,I think you misunderstood your mother's suggestion that you marry.
00:12:07.894,00:12:10.104,"We wanted someone who would help this family, not destroy it."
00:12:10.187,00:12:12.023,You think Lydia is destroying this family?
00:12:12.106,00:12:13.816,Not the fact that you were in the Circle?
00:12:16.819,00:12:17.904,You know?
00:12:20.782,00:12:23.284,"-All these years, you never said anything. -We couldn't."
00:12:23.367,00:12:24.952,Is that the best you can do?
00:12:25.619,00:12:27.872,You drilled into me that I was never good enough.
00:12:27.955,00:12:29.040,It wasn't that.
00:12:29.123,00:12:31.083,We wanted you to be better than we were.
00:12:31.167,00:12:32.919,You wanted to sweep history under the rug.
00:12:33.002,00:12:35.587,"You wanted us to save you, restore the Lightwood name."
00:12:35.671,00:12:37.799,"Alec, you're making a mistake."
00:12:39.633,00:12:41.260,And I'm gonna do it on my terms.
00:12:52.188,00:12:53.522,I need this to stop.
00:13:00.112,00:13:01.864,"Clary, I was a regular guy."
00:13:01.948,00:13:03.324,I had a life. A regular life.
00:13:07.328,00:13:08.955,I almost tore my mother apart.
00:13:11.373,00:13:13.167,What if I do that to you?
00:13:13.250,00:13:15.377,"-Simon, you won't. -Get away."
00:13:18.797,00:13:19.966,-Can you get the car? -Yeah.
00:13:23.094,00:13:24.846,-Once you feed-- -Feed?
00:13:25.512,00:13:27.764,Are you kidding? That's what this is now?
00:13:27.849,00:13:29.641,That's what my life's about? Like I'm in a zoo?
00:13:30.559,00:13:32.269,I'm... I am so sorry!
00:13:32.353,00:13:34.605,"Why are you so sorry, Raphael did this to me."
00:13:38.650,00:13:40.277,"Simon, it was my choice."
00:13:41.904,00:13:43.280,You died.
00:13:43.364,00:13:45.741,Raphael brought you to us. I had a choice.
00:13:49.828,00:13:51.622,"bury you, and you could come back."
00:13:54.959,00:13:56.002,Oh...
00:13:56.793,00:13:57.836,"Clary, why?"
00:13:57.920,00:13:59.171,"Because I love you, Simon."
00:13:59.255,00:14:02.008,You call that love? You brought me back to this?
00:14:02.925,00:14:04.301,This nothing...
00:14:05.261,00:14:09.473,"where I feed, and I have to hide from the sun, and I can't bear to be by the people that I love?"
00:14:10.307,00:14:11.934,"Did you ever think about that, Clary?"
00:14:12.018,00:14:14.061,"How I would feel, what I would be?"
00:14:14.145,00:14:16.981,"Simon, please understand-- Just stay away from me."
00:14:26.448,00:14:27.824,We have to put a stop to this.
00:14:27.909,00:14:30.661,"Yeah, well, enjoy Portaling back to Idris with Mom and Dad."
00:14:30.744,00:14:32.371,Meliorn is here because of me.
00:14:33.705,00:14:35.582,There's nothing we can do to stop this interrogation.
00:14:35.666,00:14:37.209,You're on Alec's side now?
00:14:39.545,00:14:42.548,I'm not picking sides. Jace Wayland is Switzerland.
00:14:42.631,00:14:44.383,We have got to find Valentine.
00:14:44.466,00:14:45.759,"Let's let this play out, Izzy."
00:14:45.842,00:14:47.970,Meliorn might have some important information.
00:14:51.098,00:14:53.559,Tell me what you know about the blood in the Forsaken.
00:14:53.642,00:14:58.230,Have you considered that the blood in the Forsaken came from our dead scouts?
00:14:58.314,00:15:00.732,Scouts sent to help you hunt for Valentine.
00:15:00.816,00:15:02.776,Why do you think we would side with a murderer?
00:15:02.859,00:15:04.820,Seelies always play both sides.
00:15:04.904,00:15:07.156,You should talk to your own people about playing sides.
00:15:07.239,00:15:08.657,Excuse me?
00:15:09.951,00:15:13.120,"You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?"
00:15:13.204,00:15:16.707,If only Shadowhunters had a better relationship with us...
00:15:16.790,00:15:21.128,"Downworlders, you'd know that Valentine's daughter has the Cup."
00:15:23.547,00:15:25.507,Still think we should let this play out?
00:15:31.097,00:15:32.889,I'm pretty sure that's not the cup you're looking for.
00:15:32.974,00:15:34.934,"Give me a break, Wayland. I'm just trying to do my job."
00:15:35.017,00:15:37.561,"Alec, call this off now."
00:15:37.644,00:15:39.480,I guess Clary's bedroom is in part of Switzerland?
00:15:39.563,00:15:42.024,We can't call it off. We have to find the Mortal Cup.
00:15:43.775,00:15:46.070,It's not here. Let's keep looking.
00:15:47.779,00:15:49.490,What is going on with you?
00:15:49.573,00:15:51.617,"Look, Jace, we have to turn over the Cup."
00:15:51.700,00:15:53.494,"Alec, she's risked everything to find it."
00:15:53.577,00:15:55.204,And we've risked everything for her.
00:15:55.287,00:15:58.457,"Either she gives the Cup to Lydia, or I'll do it myself."
00:16:06.007,00:16:07.299,We owe her that much.
00:16:07.383,00:16:09.176,It's the right call. You'll see.
00:16:22.814,00:16:24.358,Just drink.
00:16:32.366,00:16:33.659,Draw it. Now.
00:16:33.742,00:16:35.077,It's a Blocking rune.
00:16:35.161,00:16:37.871,It prevents anyone from finding you using Shadowhunter tracking.
00:16:39.206,00:16:40.707,"You'll see, it'll get better."
00:16:48.132,00:16:50.551,"Clary, the Clave heard you had the Cup."
00:16:52.261,00:16:54.013,"Oh, my God. Why would they..."
00:16:55.556,00:16:58.725,"-Wait, Jace, is the Cup secure? -It will be."
00:16:58.809,00:17:00.894,You need to get to someplace safe.
00:17:00.977,00:17:02.354,Someplace the Clave would never look.
00:17:02.438,00:17:03.772,I'll find you.
00:17:05.982,00:17:08.110,-We'll go to Jade Wolf. -The Clave know you like family.
00:17:08.194,00:17:09.320,They'll look there first.
00:17:14.783,00:17:16.952,Have you lost your mind?
00:17:18.079,00:17:19.538,A Shadowhunter and a werewolf?
00:17:19.621,00:17:21.082,You do know this isn't a hotel?
00:17:21.165,00:17:22.208,"Technically, it is."
00:17:22.291,00:17:25.502,Even starvation can't shut you up.
00:17:27.921,00:17:30.716,These people never listen. Don't bother. Let's go.
00:17:32.884,00:17:34.345,The fledgling can stay.
00:17:38.890,00:17:40.642,"Let's go, please. I don't want any part of this."
00:17:40.726,00:17:42.603,"Look, there isn't any place else."
00:17:45.106,00:17:48.442,"You need Simon back, right? To prove Camille broke the Accords."
00:17:48.525,00:17:51.403,What good will he be if he dies of starvation?
00:17:53.655,00:17:57.159,"Fine, but the stray waits outside."
00:17:58.952,00:18:03.457,"If anything happens to these two, you won't have to wait till sun up, I'll kill you myself."
00:18:03.540,00:18:04.625,"Easy there, Fido."
00:18:04.708,00:18:06.335,They'll be under my protection.
00:18:19.014,00:18:20.474,To a holding cell.
00:18:20.557,00:18:23.269,And a guard unit will transport him to the Silent Brothers.
00:18:23.352,00:18:25.979,"-You can't do that! -It's not our decision, Isabelle."
00:18:26.062,00:18:27.231,The Clave made the order.
00:18:27.314,00:18:29.316,That could be a death sentence to a Downworlder.
00:18:29.400,00:18:31.193,Are you trying to start a war with them?
00:18:31.277,00:18:33.028,Meliorn's told you everything he knows.
00:18:33.112,00:18:35.656,You don't know that. Maybe we haven't asked the right questions.
00:18:35.739,00:18:38.117,Seelies often skirt the truth.
00:18:43.205,00:18:44.998,That wasn't exactly helpful in the past.
00:18:46.625,00:18:48.627,"Alec, this is going too far."
00:18:48.710,00:18:50.421,We don't have a choice.
00:18:50.504,00:18:52.173,And neither do we.
00:18:52.256,00:18:54.175,Let me get this straight.
00:18:54.258,00:18:58.011,"You need Alec's stele to open the safe, and you want me to steal it from him?"
00:18:58.094,00:18:59.721,We prefer the word borrow.
00:18:59.805,00:19:01.140,Without his knowledge.
00:19:02.183,00:19:03.892,No. No can do. Not happening.
00:19:03.975,00:19:10.482,"Magnus, ever since Alec found out our parents were in the Circle, he's been messed up."
00:19:19.283,00:19:22.203,what do you think will happen if they get the Cup?
00:19:22.286,00:19:24.330,This affects everyone.
00:19:32.045,00:19:33.547,You're both going to owe me.
00:19:33.630,00:19:35.299,I'm talking 14th century.
00:19:35.382,00:19:37.801,"Gold, rubies... definitely diamonds."
00:19:40.387,00:19:41.888,That's a given.
00:19:41.972,00:19:46.310,If we're going to do this... there's no turning back.
00:20:04.578,00:20:06.497,So this is your idea of protection?
00:20:06.580,00:20:09.040,"It keeps you away from my people, and my people away from you."
00:20:10.876,00:20:12.127,Give a shout when you're hungry.
00:20:13.003,00:20:16.423,"Of course, you do have a pretty decent snack right here, no?"
00:20:16.507,00:20:18.842,"Oh, silly me."
00:20:18.925,00:20:22.053,I forgot... you two are such great friends.
00:20:24.014,00:20:25.098,Or has that changed?
00:20:37.361,00:20:39.738,you do not understand how this is.
00:20:44.826,00:20:46.745,I can hear your heartbeat.
00:20:46.828,00:20:50.206,I can smell the blood in your veins.
00:20:52.000,00:20:53.294,And I want it.
00:20:54.670,00:21:00.467,"Simon, I would not blame you if you-- What? Killed you?"
00:21:00.551,00:21:02.511,Don't you understand anything?
00:21:02.594,00:21:05.472,"No, I don't. And I can't."
00:21:05.556,00:21:08.099,But there has to be a way for you to stay in this world.
00:21:08.183,00:21:11.645,"Maybe what I did was wrong and selfish, but..."
00:21:12.938,00:21:14.606,my heart was breaking.
00:21:17.108,00:21:19.278,I thought I was a real Shadowhunter.
00:21:19.361,00:21:22.739,"Simon, when it comes to you, I am still just Clary Fray."
00:21:26.577,00:21:32.791,"I would rather you tear me apart than watch you die again, starving and angry-- Raphael!"
00:21:36.587,00:21:37.671,You ready now?
00:21:37.754,00:21:39.340,Yes.
00:21:42.008,00:21:43.259,Please!
00:21:43.344,00:21:44.803,Here you go.
00:21:54.062,00:21:56.898,It's all about presentation and quality produce.
00:21:59.318,00:22:01.111,"You see, us vampires look after one another."
00:22:02.446,00:22:04.990,-We take care of our family. -Simon already has a family.
00:22:05.073,00:22:06.241,Had a family.
00:22:07.743,00:22:09.703,That's all gonna change now.
00:22:09.786,00:22:12.998,You're a Shadowhunter... he's a vamp.
00:22:16.001,00:22:18.545,You two will never be equals.
00:22:18.629,00:22:20.506,You'll have to learn that for yourself.
00:23:34.287,00:23:35.997,Not bad for a day's work.
00:23:37.415,00:23:39.209,I thought I'd see how you were doing.
00:23:43.129,00:23:45.131,I meant to thank you for your advice.
00:23:46.132,00:23:49.010,The whole... follow your heart thing.
00:23:51.304,00:23:54.558,I have a deep understanding of the human psyche.
00:23:54.641,00:23:56.602,"At least, that's what Freud always said."
00:24:02.398,00:24:08.154,"I mean, we should at least go to dinner first-- No, Magnus, family is everything to me."
00:24:08.238,00:24:10.031,You have to know that.
00:24:10.115,00:24:11.449,I get it.
00:24:11.533,00:24:13.994,"You're part of a Don't ask, don't tell culture."
00:24:14.077,00:24:17.080,I'm fine with it. You're a traditional guy.
00:24:17.163,00:24:18.331,"Yeah, I am."
00:24:20.876,00:24:23.419,That's why I proposed to Lydia.
00:24:27.508,00:24:28.675,interesting.
00:24:33.304,00:24:35.181,It's a solid partnership.
00:24:35.265,00:24:37.058,For both of us.
00:24:42.523,00:24:43.899,That's hot!
00:24:46.777,00:24:48.444,"Well, okay, then."
00:24:50.989,00:24:53.742,Marriage is a wonderful institution.
00:24:53.825,00:24:55.368,Not that I would know.
00:25:13.970,00:25:15.722,You might wanna pick up the pace.
00:25:15.806,00:25:18.600,You do not wanna be on my bad side right now.
00:25:18.684,00:25:19.976,Are you gonna be okay?
00:25:20.060,00:25:21.937,The whole world is turning upside down.
00:25:22.020,00:25:23.939,Simon turned into a vampire.
00:25:24.022,00:25:26.942,Now Meliorn might die because of some-- It's not anything you did.
00:25:27.025,00:25:31.154,"They just put a bunch of unrelated facts together, and came up with a big lie."
00:25:31.780,00:25:33.156,I wish that made me feel better.
00:25:35.075,00:25:36.242,Where do you think you're going?
00:25:36.326,00:25:41.497,"It's a very dangerous time, and no one is supposed to leave the premises without express orders."
00:25:41.582,00:25:43.959,"-Hodge, we were just about to-- -Lie to me?"
00:25:44.042,00:25:47.295,"Clary needs us, Hodge. The Clave is looking for her."
00:25:47.378,00:25:49.339,She could be in serious danger.
00:25:50.966,00:25:55.971,"Well, in that case, I'd make a timely exit before anyone of importance notices you're gone."
00:25:57.931,00:25:59.390,We won't forget this.
00:26:06.022,00:26:07.315,Hold it. Lydia...
00:26:09.943,00:26:12.112,are you sure about this?
00:26:12.195,00:26:16.241,Do you think I'd be sending Meliorn to the Silent Brothers if I thought there was another way?
00:26:20.203,00:26:23.832,You heard about my fiancé... how he died.
00:26:23.915,00:26:25.792,"Yeah, it was a demon attack in Rio."
00:26:28.544,00:26:30.964,We'd gotten intel about a demon threat at Carnival.
00:26:31.047,00:26:35.260,The demons were reportedly at this club in the favela.
00:26:35.343,00:26:37.846,But we had no idea how many there were.
00:26:37.929,00:26:42.558,"We got word of a warlock on their payroll, so... we brought him in."
00:26:42.643,00:26:45.228,My team wanted to make him talk.
00:26:45.311,00:26:48.606,"Whatever it took, they were willing to do, but..."
00:26:48.690,00:26:51.484,I wouldn't allow it.
00:26:51.567,00:26:55.030,I just couldn't stand by and watch the torture.
00:26:55.113,00:26:57.032,You made a judgment call.
00:26:58.324,00:27:00.493,It was the wrong call.
00:27:00.576,00:27:01.953,We went in blind.
00:27:02.037,00:27:06.207,And there had to have been 100 demons.
00:27:07.250,00:27:11.713,"The whole raid went sideways, and... John..."
00:27:13.381,00:27:14.966,That's how he died.
00:27:15.050,00:27:18.261,If only I just had the guts to do what needed to be done.
00:27:20.972,00:27:22.182,I can't make that mistake again.
00:27:24.059,00:27:27.854,"We rule with our heads, not with our hearts."
00:27:29.147,00:27:30.523,Agreed.
00:27:44.079,00:27:45.163,How are you feeling now?
00:27:45.246,00:27:46.915,"I'm drinking blood, Clary."
00:27:46.998,00:27:50.794,"I know, Simon, but-- I never wanted any part of any of this."
00:27:52.295,00:27:55.757,-The whole Shadow World. -Neither did I.
00:27:55.841,00:27:57.675,At least you're a superior being.
00:27:59.135,00:28:00.762,I'm a Downworlder.
00:28:03.890,00:28:06.727,Well... I don't wanna bite you anymore.
00:28:08.812,00:28:10.188,"Well, that's good."
00:28:11.397,00:28:15.235,"Simon, what if I brought you back because I wanted us both to be different?"
00:28:16.111,00:28:19.614,"I mean, suddenly I was this new person, and..."
00:28:19.697,00:28:21.742,you were still living in our old world.
00:28:22.868,00:28:26.913,Maybe I... I just couldn't fight this deep need for-- For us to be together.
00:28:26.997,00:28:28.539,Yes.
00:28:31.584,00:28:34.004,"Look, I understand if you hate me now."
00:28:35.171,00:28:36.506,Be angry with you?
00:28:38.299,00:28:39.425,Yeah.
00:28:41.177,00:28:42.178,Hate you?
00:28:44.806,00:28:46.057,Never.
00:28:52.731,00:28:54.232,What's gonna happen to us?
00:28:55.525,00:28:58.569,Luke and Raphael can't stand each other.
00:28:58.653,00:29:01.823,Every Downworlder seems to despise Shadowhunters.
00:29:03.199,00:29:04.450,Can't you see the divide?
00:29:04.534,00:29:06.119,Not between us.
00:29:06.953,00:29:07.996,No.
00:29:11.624,00:29:12.793,Never.
00:29:15.170,00:29:17.297,It appears the cavalry has arrived.
00:29:21.885,00:29:23.594,You'll wanna use the back stairs.
00:29:33.939,00:29:35.356,Hey.
00:29:35.440,00:29:37.108,Thank God you're okay.
00:29:40.611,00:29:42.488,"So this is your safe hideout, huh?"
00:29:42.572,00:29:44.365,"Well, you think the Clave was gonna look here?"
00:29:44.449,00:29:46.034,Can we please focus on the matter at hand?
00:29:46.117,00:29:49.412,Unless no one here cares that the Clave is planning on murdering Meliorn.
00:29:51.164,00:29:53.249,has more information on Valentine and the attack than he's saying.
00:29:53.333,00:29:55.210,They're taking him to the Silent Brothers.
00:29:55.293,00:29:56.336,We have to stop them!
00:29:56.419,00:29:58.629,"That's the plan, Clary. Rescue and recovery."
00:29:58.713,00:30:01.007,"We get him from the guards, in and out, no one gets hurt."
00:30:01.091,00:30:04.635,"You want us to go up against the Silent Brothers, and an elite Shadowhunter guard unit?"
00:30:04.719,00:30:06.888,"-Without any backup? -Pretty much sums it up, yeah."
00:30:08.014,00:30:09.099,Is Alec coming?
00:30:11.767,00:30:13.228,No. Not this time.
00:30:14.270,00:30:17.273,"If they're doing this to Seelies, no Downworlder is safe."
00:30:18.149,00:30:20.610,"But we can't go in alone, not if we don't want to be detected."
00:30:20.693,00:30:22.570,"My pack will track the unit, create a distraction."
00:30:26.241,00:30:29.870,"As much as I hate to agree with Simon, vamps aren't exactly team players."
00:30:31.787,00:30:33.874,I think I can persuade him.
00:30:39.045,00:30:41.381,We're offering an alliance with the Seelies.
00:30:49.805,00:30:53.101,You killed our people. You violated our home.
00:30:53.184,00:30:55.186,"You kidnapped a mundane, remember?"
00:30:55.270,00:30:56.729,-That was me. -Look...
00:30:56.812,00:30:58.773,you were just following Camille's orders.
00:30:58.857,00:31:01.192,She violated the Accords.
00:31:01.276,00:31:03.278,You are a different kind of leader.
00:31:05.947,00:31:08.116,We are a new generation of Shadowhunters.
00:31:08.199,00:31:10.076,We believe everyone can be equal.
00:31:10.160,00:31:14.247,But we have to work together to stop Valentine.
00:31:14.330,00:31:16.707,And to ensure the Clave doesn't repeat past mistakes.
00:31:19.920,00:31:22.338,This decision requires a consensus.
00:31:27.260,00:31:28.469,I vote yes.
00:31:28.553,00:31:30.805,"Well, well, well, baby's first words."
00:31:30.889,00:31:32.265,Don't make me regret them.
00:31:33.099,00:31:37.896,If our newest member pledges his loyalty to his new leader and joins our clan...
00:31:37.979,00:31:40.190,we'll all stand beside you.
00:31:40.273,00:31:41.942,Simon's not a pawn.
00:31:42.025,00:31:44.444,No... I'm not.
00:31:47.280,00:31:49.240,"-But I accept your deal. -Simon, what are you doing?"
00:31:49.324,00:31:51.034,Whatever it takes to protect the Downworld.
00:31:52.077,00:31:53.661,It's my world now.
00:31:59.084,00:32:00.251,Then we're in.
00:32:25.276,00:32:27.195,The City of Bones has a service entrance. Perfect!
00:32:27.278,00:32:29.739,I hope I have better luck here than I did last time.
00:32:29.822,00:32:30.823,I'm just saying.
00:32:34.535,00:32:36.537,Text when you're in position.
00:32:39.499,00:32:40.500,Stay.
00:32:41.417,00:32:43.253,-Good dog. -Bite me.
00:32:43.336,00:32:45.130,-Roll over. -Play dead.
00:32:45.213,00:32:46.339,Boom!
00:32:54.139,00:32:55.681,"Hey, enough! Enough!"
00:32:55.765,00:32:57.433,All our lives are at stake!
00:32:57.517,00:33:00.853,"It's time we put aside our differences, and work together!"
00:33:03.106,00:33:05.483,Tonight we're all Downworlders.
00:33:06.109,00:33:07.235,Luke?
00:33:19.372,00:33:22.125,I guess I should expect people to hate me for who I am now.
00:33:22.208,00:33:23.293,I'll get used to it.
00:33:23.376,00:33:26.379,Never get used to it. You hear me?
00:33:29.507,00:33:30.716,Let's do this.
00:33:40.768,00:33:42.895,"We're risking everything, aren't we?"
00:33:42.978,00:33:45.648,"Going against the Clave, against the other Shadowhunters..."
00:33:45.731,00:33:48.026,"Valentine's trying to destroy the world, Clary."
00:33:51.904,00:33:53.323,Before I forget...
00:33:54.657,00:33:55.700,These belong to you.
00:33:57.118,00:33:59.120,Did Alec give you these?
00:34:01.831,00:34:04.292,-Be careful. -Don't worry. I won't activate it...
00:34:07.002,00:34:08.088,Thank you.
00:34:13.008,00:34:14.385,Right.
00:34:16.762,00:34:20.391,So what are we thinking? A little encanto action?
00:34:20.475,00:34:23.644,-You know there's a rune for that. -Of course there is.
00:34:23.728,00:34:25.896,Just watch and learn from the master.
00:34:26.939,00:34:29.650,Remember... no one gets hurt.
00:34:44.207,00:34:45.541,Come here.
00:35:07.522,00:35:08.898,"Oh, no."
00:35:18.116,00:35:19.492,Damn it.
00:35:21.661,00:35:23.454,Alec's future wife. Don't ask.
00:35:23.538,00:35:25.748,"Just say the word, and we'll call the whole thing off."
00:35:25.831,00:35:28.668,"No, there's no turning back now."
00:35:28.751,00:35:32.380,"So whatever happens, follow my lead."
00:35:44.767,00:35:46.686,Secure the perimeter. Do it now.
00:35:57.947,00:35:59.532,I'll take Meliorn inside.
00:35:59.615,00:36:00.991,Just stay here.
00:36:01.075,00:36:02.410,Nobody gets through.
00:36:25.057,00:36:27.518,Quiet. I won't tell you again.
00:36:46.537,00:36:48.038,Alec.
00:36:53.168,00:36:55.713,You told me you were taking Clary back to the Institute.
00:36:55.796,00:36:58.508,-You lied to me. -I did what needed to be done.
00:36:58.591,00:37:00.175,"Alec, the Clave has gone too far."
00:37:00.260,00:37:02.470,"You have to see that. Please, just let Meliorn go."
00:37:02.553,00:37:04.054,I have my orders.
00:37:04.138,00:37:06.557,You and your damn orders. Who cares about orders?
00:37:06.641,00:37:08.559,See? That's how little you know about being a Shadowhunter.
00:37:08.643,00:37:13.648,You couldn't possibly understand-- Not this time.
00:37:16.901,00:37:17.943,I'm really sorry.
00:37:25.117,00:37:28.496,"You always broke the rules, but never the law, not until she showed up."
00:37:30.415,00:37:32.124,"And now you're getting married, Alec?"
00:37:32.207,00:37:33.793,We both know what this is about.
00:37:33.876,00:37:35.461,"Oh, do we? Okay."
00:37:35.545,00:37:37.838,"Why doesn't the legend, Jace Wayland, tell us what's it about?"
00:37:37.922,00:38:06.326,It's about me! It's about your feelings. It's because you're-- Do it.
00:38:06.409,00:38:07.493,Do it!
00:38:09.579,00:38:12.415,"I don't wanna be alive if we're on different sides, Alec."
00:38:27.262,00:38:28.806,Come with me.
00:38:30.265,00:38:33.102,We'll fight Valentine the right way... together.
00:38:34.019,00:38:35.605,If we do that...
00:38:36.731,00:38:39.442,we'll be considered traitors like Mom and Dad.
00:38:39.525,00:38:43.696,"I'm begging you, my parabatai... my brother."
00:38:43.779,00:38:45.990,"Please, Alec, come with me."
00:38:52.079,00:38:53.122,No.
00:39:15.520,00:39:19.649,"Meliorn is a wanted man, we have to get him back to the Seelie court where he's protected."
00:39:22.109,00:39:23.486,I wish you could come with us.
00:39:26.739,00:39:28.198,I've got a lot of stuff to work on here.
00:39:28.824,00:39:31.827,Like... controlling my murderous tendencies.
00:39:34.372,00:39:36.416,We'll see each other soon.
00:39:37.041,00:39:38.626,Before you know it.
00:39:40.210,00:39:43.464,"-Simon, listen, I-- -What's done is done."
00:39:43.548,00:39:46.967,I'm a vampire... and you're a Shadowhunter.
00:39:49.136,00:39:50.638,"Maybe that's supposed to mean something, but..."
00:39:56.477,00:39:57.728,Sort of.
00:39:57.812,00:40:00.398,Enough... anyway.
00:40:09.949,00:40:11.241,Let's work up to hugging...
00:40:11.325,00:40:13.744,because I haven't had dinner yet.
00:40:13.828,00:40:15.496,-Sorry. -It's okay.
00:40:37.977,00:40:39.437,Welcome home.
00:40:48.988,00:40:50.781,I underestimated you.
00:40:51.699,00:40:52.825,Is that a thank you?
00:40:52.908,00:40:55.035,"In the Seelie world, it is."
00:41:02.001,00:41:04.754,"I hate to break up this reunion, Izzy, but we have to go."
00:41:07.006,00:41:08.466,You're in good hands.
00:41:12.928,00:41:14.889,Try and talk some sense into Alec.
00:41:19.268,00:41:20.561,We will.
00:41:34.158,00:41:35.743,That you spearheaded my rescue.
00:41:35.826,00:41:37.411,Don't give me too much credit.
00:41:37.495,00:41:39.747,Isabelle made this happen. We just helped.
00:41:40.873,00:41:42.332,She's being modest.
00:41:43.083,00:41:45.127,You're a Shadowhunter now.
00:41:46.962,00:41:50.340,I've been surprised by more than one Shadowhunter tonight.
00:41:50.424,00:41:52.510,You risked everything to unite us.
00:41:52.593,00:41:54.512,Right after you tried to sell her out.
00:41:57.056,00:42:00.434,Which is why I'm offering you a gift... for your sacrifice.
00:42:02.311,00:42:03.437,If you're ready...
00:42:04.730,00:42:07.274,I can help you find your father.
