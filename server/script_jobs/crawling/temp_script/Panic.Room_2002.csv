00:01:41.560,00:01:43.729,I WROTE IT ALL DOWN.
00:01:43.729,00:01:45.689,FOUR FLOORS-- PERFECT.
00:01:45.689,00:01:48.984,"COURTYARD IN BACK, SOUTH-FACING GARDEN. PERFECT."
00:01:48.984,00:01:50.819,SHOULDN'T WE JUST WAIT FOR THE CAR SERVICE ?
00:01:50.819,00:01:52.237,"NO, WE'LL SIT IN TRAFFIC FOREVER."
00:01:52.237,00:01:53.405,IS THAT THE LISTING SHEET ?
00:01:53.405,00:01:55.323,THERE IS NO LISTING SHEET.
00:01:55.323,00:01:57.785,I HEARD ABOUT IT THIS MORNING.
00:01:57.785,00:01:59.369,"WELL, HOW MANY MORE AFTER THIS ONE ?"
00:01:59.369,00:02:01.830,NONE. YOU KNOW HOW TIGHT THE MARKET IS.
00:02:01.830,00:02:03.582,"SARAH, DO YOU HAVE TO RIDE THAT HERE ?"
00:02:03.582,00:02:05.042,"MOM, WE'RE IN THE STREET."
00:02:06.293,00:02:08.211,EVAN !
00:02:11.048,00:02:14.259,"ONE DAY, YOU WILL LEARN TO RESPECT PEOPLE'S TIME, LYDIA."
00:02:14.259,00:02:19.056,"ONE DAY, YOU WILL REALIZE THAT THE WORLD DOES NOT STOP AND START AT YOUR CONVENIENCE."
00:02:19.056,00:02:21.100,"OH, I AM SO, SO SORRY."
00:02:21.100,00:02:28.857,"I'M MEETING ARTHUR DIGBY LAURENCE IN 26 MINUTES, AND IF YOU THINK ARTHUR DIGBY LAURENCE IS THE KIND OF MAN WHO TOLERATES TARDINESS, YOU ARE SADLY MISTAKEN."
00:02:28.857,00:02:30.651,YOU ARE A SAINT TO WAIT FOR US.
00:02:31.485,00:02:33.194,HEY.
00:02:35.155,00:02:39.534,IT'S KIND OF BETWEEN A TOWN HOUSE AND A BROWNSTONE.
00:02:39.534,00:02:43.705,"WE LIKE TO CALL IT A TOWNSTONE, BUILT IN 1879."
00:02:43.705,00:02:46.458,"THIS IS THE MIDDLE OF THE HOUSE, THE PARLOR FLOOR."
00:02:46.458,00:02:51.254,HERE IS THE LIVING ROOM.
00:02:51.254,00:02:58.137,"CASUAL DINING BELOW ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR, WHICH WAS RENOVATED IN '94 WITH ALL THE EXPECTED AMENITIES."
00:02:58.137,00:03:00.263,SARAH !
00:03:01.515,00:03:03.851,THERE ARE TWO BEDROOM FLOORS ABOVE.
00:03:05.560,00:03:07.896,"MY GOD, IT'S AMAZING."
00:03:07.896,00:03:11.150,"HEY, KID, NO SCOOTER."
00:03:11.150,00:03:13.986,I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS AMOUNT OF LIVING SPACE...
00:03:13.986,00:03:15.779,IS EXTREMELY UNCOMMON IN MANHATTAN.
00:03:17.739,00:03:21.743,IT'S GOT A YARD.
00:03:21.743,00:03:25.497,"WHICH IS IN A BIT OF DISARRAY, BUT THEN AGAIN, 21-FOOT LOT, 53 DEEP."
00:03:25.497,00:03:27.624,IT ALLOWS FOR AN EXPANSIVE GARDEN.
00:03:27.624,00:03:30.085,WORKING ELEVATOR.
00:03:31.712,00:03:34.089,THE PREVIOUS OWNER WAS DISABLED THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE.
00:03:34.089,00:03:35.590,"HIGHLY UNUSUAL, THE ELEVATOR."
00:03:35.590,00:03:37.759,YOU WILL NOT FIND THIS IN 90% OF BROWNSTONES.
00:03:37.759,00:03:42.764,"PERHAPS IT IS SOMETHING OF A FIXER-UPPER, BUT WE ANTICIPATE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF INTEREST."
00:03:42.764,00:03:46.393,IT'S A VERY EMOTIONAL PROPERTY.
00:03:46.393,00:03:48.687,SHALL WE HAVE A LOOK AT THE REST ?
00:03:52.107,00:03:54.234,YOU SHOULD MAKE AN OFFER IMMEDIATELY.
00:03:54.234,00:03:56.945,"WELL, CAN I SEE IT FIRST ?"
00:03:54.234,00:03:59.489,"BELIEVE ME, THERE IS NOTHING REMOTELY LIKE THIS ON MARKET RIGHT NOW."
00:03:59.489,00:04:02.367,YOU CAN'T MOVE FROM GREENWICH TO THE UPPER WEST SIDE...
00:04:02.367,00:04:04.452,AND EXPECT TO STILL HAVE A HOUSE AND A YARD...
00:04:04.452,00:04:06.454,"AND A DOG AND A CAT, BUT HERE IT IS."
00:04:06.454,00:04:09.041,IT'S GOT EVERYTHING YOU TOLD ME YOU WANTED AND MORE.
00:04:09.041,00:04:12.002,YOU'LL HAVE ANOTHER FAMILY.
00:04:12.002,00:04:13.712,IT'S A FORTUNE.
00:04:13.712,00:04:15.338,"MOM, IT'S NOT BARNEYS."
00:04:15.338,00:04:18.133,YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE ON THE TAG.
00:04:22.387,00:04:24.514,YOU CAN AFFORD IT.
00:04:26.100,00:04:29.978,IT WOULD BE SO LOVELY IF I COULD SHOW THE PROPERTY BEFORE I LEAVE.
00:04:33.648,00:04:39.362,"HARDWOOD FLOORS THROUGHOUT, AS MANY AS SIX WORKING FIREPLACES."
00:04:39.362,00:04:43.117,THIS IS THE TOP FLOOR.
00:04:43.117,00:04:45.035,THEY SHARE ONE SMALL BATH.
00:04:45.035,00:04:47.579,"ORIGINALLY, THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SERVANTS' QUARTERS."
00:04:47.579,00:04:50.373,THE PREVIOUS OWNER KEPT A SMALL NURSING STAFF.
00:04:50.373,00:04:52.793,I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE LIVE-IN HELP.
00:04:52.793,00:04:54.628,"NO, NO, IT'S JUST THE TWO OF US."
00:04:59.549,00:05:02.970,"THIRD FLOOR, SPARE BEDROOM, DEN, WHAT HAVE YOU."
00:05:02.970,00:05:05.305,MR. PEARLSTINE USED THIS AS AN OFFICE.
00:05:05.305,00:05:08.642,"HE'S TALKING ABOUT SIDNEY PEARLSTINE, THE FINANCIER."
00:05:08.642,00:05:10.227,OH.
00:05:10.227,00:05:16.399,"MAY I ASK WHAT YOU DO, MISSUS-- ALTMAN. ACTUALLY, I'M GOING BACK TO SCHOOL. COLUMBIA."
00:05:16.399,00:05:19.736,HER HUSBAND'S IN PHARMACEUTICALS.
00:05:19.736,00:05:24.116,"OH, I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE STEPHAN ALTMAN'S WIFE."
00:05:24.116,00:05:26.118,"YES, UNTIL RECENTLY."
00:05:27.410,00:05:28.996,MASTER BATH.
00:05:31.957,00:05:34.542,PEARLSTINE'S BEEN IN ALL THE PAPERS SINCE HE DIED.
00:05:34.542,00:05:36.878,HIS KIDS ARE SUING EACH OTHER OVER THE ESTATE.
00:05:36.878,00:05:39.380,"HE WAS A RECLUSE-- RICH, PARANOID."
00:05:39.380,00:05:41.842,NOW IT TURNS OUT THEY CAN'T FIND HALF HIS MONEY.
00:05:41.842,00:05:44.886,I HARDLY SEE HOW FAMILY GOSSIP IS GERMANE TO SHOWING THE PROPERTY.
00:05:44.886,00:05:47.181,STOP CALLING IT THE PROPERTY.
00:05:48.723,00:05:51.185,WALK-IN CLOSET.
00:05:54.479,00:05:56.898,COULD THE LITTLE ONE PLEASE STOP THAT ?
00:05:56.898,00:05:58.817,"KID, NO ELEVATOR !"
00:05:58.817,00:06:02.737,AND WE EMERGE IN THE MASTER SUITE.
00:06:10.037,00:06:12.331,THAT'S STRANGE.
00:06:12.331,00:06:15.209,WHAT ?
00:06:20.421,00:06:22.549,IS THIS ROOM SMALLER THAN IT SHOULD BE ?
00:06:22.549,00:06:24.843,YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON TO NOTICE.
00:06:24.843,00:06:30.057,"ON CARAVAN, NO ONE FROM OUR OFFICE HAD THE SLIGHTEST IDEA."
00:06:40.775,00:06:42.903,IT'S CALLED A PANIC ROOM.
00:06:42.903,00:06:45.655,WHAT ?
00:06:45.655,00:06:48.825,A CASTLE KEEP IN MEDIEVAL TIMES.
00:06:48.825,00:06:51.410,THEY'RE QUITE EN VOGUE IN HIGH-END CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW.
00:06:51.410,00:06:53.663,ONE REALLY CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL ABOUT HOME INVASION.
00:06:53.663,00:06:57.500,THIS IS PERFECT. THE ALARM GOES OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
00:06:57.500,00:06:58.710,WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ?
00:06:58.710,00:07:00.419,CALL THE POLICE AND WAIT TILL TUESDAY ?
00:07:00.419,00:07:02.589,TRAIPSE DOWNSTAIRS IN YOUR UNDER THINGS TO CHECK IT OUT ?
00:07:02.589,00:07:05.508,I THINK NOT.
00:07:05.508,00:07:08.303,"BURIED PHONE LINE, NOT CONNECTED TO THE HOUSE'S MAIN LINE."
00:07:08.303,00:07:10.597,YOU CAN CALL THE POLICE.
00:07:10.597,00:07:12.140,YOU HAVE YOUR OWN VENTILATION SYSTEM.
00:07:12.140,00:07:15.685,A BANK OF SURVEILLANCE MONITORS THAT COVERS NEARLY EVERY CORNER OF THE HOUSE.
00:07:15.685,00:07:18.605,THIS WHOLE THING MAKES ME NERVOUS.
00:07:18.605,00:07:21.983,EVER READ ANY POE ?
00:07:21.983,00:07:24.652,"NO, BUT I LOVED HER LAST ALBUM."
00:07:27.197,00:07:29.366,WHAT'S TO KEEP SOMEBODY FROM PRYING OPEN THE DOOR ?
00:07:29.366,00:07:31.492,STEEL. THICK STEEL.
00:07:31.492,00:07:34.204,VERY THICK STEEL.
00:07:31.492,00:07:37.874,"FULL BATTERY BACKUP, SO EVEN IF THE POWER'S OUT, IT'S STILL FUNCTIONAL."
00:07:37.874,00:07:40.001,"OH, MY GOD !"
00:07:40.001,00:07:42.503,"OLD SIDNEY DIDN'T MISS A TRICK, DID HE ?"
00:07:42.503,00:07:43.880,"OPEN IT, PLEASE."
00:07:43.880,00:07:47.217,"AND WITH KIDS LIKE HE'S APPARENTLY GOT, NO WONDER HE WANTED A PLACE TO HIDE."
00:07:47.217,00:07:48.635,PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR.
00:07:48.635,00:07:50.387,THAT IS HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE.
00:07:50.387,00:07:52.847,"OPEN THE DOOR, PLEASE."
00:07:57.394,00:08:00.397,MY ROOM.
00:08:00.397,00:08:02.316,THIS IS REALLY DANGEROUS.
00:08:02.316,00:08:05.735,THAT DOOR IS A HAZARD.
00:08:05.735,00:08:07.487,WHOA !
00:08:07.487,00:08:10.698,"MOTION DETECTOR, LIKE AN ELEVATOR."
00:08:10.698,00:08:13.160,WON'T LET THE DOOR CLOSE IF SOMEBODY'S BLOCKING IT.
00:08:13.160,00:08:17.080,THERE'S ANOTHER ONE AT YOUR ANKLES. IT COULDN'T BE SAFER.
00:08:31.094,00:08:34.181,I KNOW THEY'LL TAKE ASKING PRICE.
00:08:50.571,00:08:53.533,IT'S WORKING.
00:08:53.533,00:08:57.371,"GOOD FOR YOU, MOM."
00:08:57.371,00:09:00.957,FIVE-SEVEN-NINE WHAT ?
00:09:06.921,00:09:09.632,"PATSY'S PIZZA, PLEASE HOLD."

00:09:57.805,00:10:02.227,"I AGREE, BUT DON'T."
00:10:22.080,00:10:24.374,DON'T YOU THINK THIS PLACE HAS WAY TOO MANY STAIRS ?
00:10:24.374,00:10:26.667,"WELL, YOU DIDN'T CARRY ANYTHING UP THEM."
00:10:26.667,00:10:29.337,YOU NEVER DID ASK ME WHAT I THOUGHT OF THIS HOUSE.
00:10:29.337,00:10:31.923,BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO TELL ME YOU HATED IT.
00:10:31.923,00:10:33.300,I LIKED OUR OLD HOUSE.
00:10:33.300,00:10:35.676,"WELL, SO DID I."
00:10:35.676,00:10:38.597,YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING ?
00:10:35.676,00:10:41.099,"I WAS THINKING WE COULD, UH, WE COULD STENCIL A WHOLE BOOKCASE."
00:10:41.099,00:10:43.851,"AND WE COULD CUT THE STENCILS, DO IT OURSELVES."
00:10:45.228,00:10:47.439,GO AHEAD.
00:10:51.651,00:10:54.779,"OH, DAMN."
00:10:54.779,00:10:57.449,I FORGOT TO SET UP THAT TOUR OF YOUR NEW SCHOOL.

00:11:02.745,00:11:05.165,"SO, I'LL JUST TAKE A CAB AND MEET HIM THERE."
00:11:07.208,00:11:09.294,IS THAT WHAT HE SAID ?
00:11:09.294,00:11:14.382,"ISN'T THAT WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT MANHATTAN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRIVE ME EVERYWHERE ?"
00:11:14.382,00:11:16.635,I'LL RIDE WITH YOU.

01:29:14.516,01:29:16.143,"OH, THAT PHONE CALL."
01:29:16.143,01:29:24.526,AND YOUR NEIGHBORS ACROSS THE COURTYARD CALLED IN ABOUT SOME LOUD SHOUTS OR A LOUDSPEAKER OF SOME KIND.
01:29:24.526,01:29:28.738,THAT WAS THE TV.
01:29:28.738,01:29:33.368,CAN I JUST ASK YOU ONE QUESTION ? UH...

01:30:00.645,01:30:03.815,I ADMIT I WAS A LITTLE DRUNK.
01:30:03.815,01:30:18.247,"AND THE SENTENCE, IF YOU INSIST ON KNOWING, WAS GOING TO BE, THERE ARE THREE THINGS THAT I WILL DO FOR YOU IF YOU COME OVER HERE AND JUMP INTO BED WITH ME RIGHT NOW."

01:30:27.047,01:30:29.716,SO NOBODY WOULD EVER HAVE TO KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING.
01:30:29.716,01:30:36.806,"UNLESS, OF COURSE, TWO POLICEMEN CAME TO MY DOOR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND INTERROGATED ME."
01:30:40.769,01:30:42.187,"SO, RICK, YOU WANNA GO ?"
01:30:43.939,01:30:47.234,OR DO YOU WANT HER TO TELL YOU WHICH THREE THINGS ?
01:30:49.652,01:30:53.156,ALL RIGHT.
01:30:56.159,01:31:12.134,"IF THERE'S SOMETHING YOU WANNA SAY TO US, BUT MAYBE YOU CAN'T SAY IT RIGHT NOW, YOU MIGHT WANNA MAKE SOME KIND OF A SIGNAL BY BLINKING YOUR EYES A FEW TIMES."
01:31:13.551,01:31:16.012,SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
01:31:19.391,01:31:24.062,THAT'S SOMETHING YOU COULD DO... SAFELY.
01:31:30.444,01:31:34.072,MAN...

01:31:51.714,01:31:54.634,"NO, I'M FINE. I'M FINE."
01:32:03.101,01:32:07.397,"SORRY TO DISTURB YOU, MA'AM."

01:32:31.713,01:32:35.800,"DO ONE, SAME PRICE FOR THE REST."
