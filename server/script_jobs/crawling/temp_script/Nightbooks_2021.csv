00:00:40.498,00:00:43.334,He said he'll never write another story ever again.
00:00:59.392,00:01:01.394,I'm gonna burn all this stupid stuff!
00:01:14.032,00:01:15.950,or be this wound that haunts him.
00:01:16.659,00:01:17.619,Poor little guy.
00:01:19.120,00:01:21.748,but maybe we let his obsession with horror get out of hand.
00:01:26.169,00:01:30.298,"Maybe it would be easier if he was just more, I don't know, normal."
00:01:39.432,00:01:40.433,Alex?
00:01:40.517,00:01:41.893,I didn't hear anything.
00:02:33.611,00:02:37.574,Your boys and my boys.
00:02:41.995,00:02:43.413,"I still want you, Lucy."
00:02:54.507,00:02:55.717,"Michael, no!"
00:02:59.846,00:03:00.847,Michael!
00:03:51.898,00:03:52.941,Where am I?
00:04:13.586,00:04:14.504,Hello?
00:04:14.587,00:04:15.713,Anyone?
00:04:15.797,00:04:17.006,I'm trapped!
00:04:17.507,00:04:18.341,Mom!
00:04:18.967,00:04:20.009,Dad!
00:04:45.868,00:04:46.995,A… Alex.
00:04:48.246,00:04:50.039,Alex Mosher.
00:05:28.578,00:05:30.496,Let's get this over with. I'm a busy witch.
00:05:30.580,00:05:32.123,Are you useful in any way?
00:05:35.501,00:05:36.461,Do you see them?
00:05:36.544,00:05:39.339,The apartment lured them in.
00:05:40.923,00:05:42.425,That's what the apartment does.
00:05:44.802,00:05:48.598,"Those children, they were not useful to me."
00:05:49.932,00:05:51.309,Do you understand?
00:05:51.392,00:05:52.894,So let's try this again.
00:05:52.977,00:05:57.732,Is there anything special about you at all?
00:05:57.815,00:05:59.984,Any reason I should let you live?
00:06:10.536,00:06:12.580,"Goodbye, Alex."
00:06:25.885,00:06:29.806,Did you say scary stories?
00:06:31.974,00:06:33.309,What's… what's that?
00:06:35.937,00:06:36.854,No more questions.
00:06:38.064,00:06:41.109,My Nightbooks. It's where I wrote my stories.
00:06:42.902,00:06:45.029,What are you doing with these so late at night?
00:06:45.113,00:06:49.992,I was… I was gonna burn them in the boiler room downstairs.
00:06:50.076,00:06:52.537,Burn them? So they're not any good.
00:06:52.620,00:06:54.038,"-No. -Goodbye, Alex."
00:06:54.122,00:06:56.374,"They're good. They're very, really, really good."
00:06:57.959,00:06:59.210,"Nightbooks, huh?"
00:07:00.753,00:07:03.381,The title better not be the scariest thing about them.
00:07:03.464,00:07:06.551,I'm going to need a story every night.
00:07:06.634,00:08:33.638,"The story better be good, and it better be scary, Mischievous little thing."
00:08:35.556,00:08:36.682,How'd you get in here?
00:09:40.746,00:09:41.872,Where's the TV?
00:10:26.375,00:10:27.460,Oh my God.
00:10:27.960,00:10:29.045,You scared me.
00:10:44.560,00:10:45.436,What?
00:10:49.106,00:10:50.650,I'm Alex. Who are you?
00:10:53.694,00:10:54.695,I'm Yasmin.
00:10:56.530,00:10:58.074,Are you a prisoner too?
00:10:58.574,00:11:00.159,"No, I'm on vacation."
00:11:00.785,00:11:01.869,"Okay, food's here."
00:11:02.578,00:11:04.246,Hope you like peanut butter.
00:11:04.330,00:11:05.539,I used to.
00:11:06.749,00:11:08.876,Anything in these cabinets is off-limits.
00:11:08.959,00:11:12.088,Don't ever think Natacha won't miss this piece of popcorn.
00:11:14.340,00:11:15.925,"Come out, you evil skin-bag."
00:11:22.515,00:11:25.643,You say cat. I say Natacha's little spy-beast.
00:11:27.019,00:11:32.108,And Natacha is… Keep up. Natacha is the witch.
00:11:32.191,00:11:37.363,"Lenore is that wrinkled, hairless thing that follows you around all day, popping up out of nowhere."
00:11:37.446,00:11:39.949,She ratted me out over a stinking cup of noodles.
00:11:40.032,00:11:41.075,I hate that cat.
00:11:43.494,00:11:46.706,Don't just stand there. Help me clean this up before Natacha gets home.
00:11:49.083,00:11:50.751,"Where is she, Natacha?"
00:11:50.835,00:11:54.547,"I don't know where she goes or what she does, but she can go anywhere she wants."
00:11:54.630,00:11:57.842,"Talk about the ultimate passport, this apartment is it."
00:11:57.925,00:12:00.803,Come on. We both have work to do. I'll get you set up.
00:12:00.886,00:12:02.513,Ultimate passport?
00:12:02.596,00:12:05.641,"The apartment travels all over the world, luring kids in."
00:12:06.142,00:12:08.144,I'm from New York. Brooklyn.
00:12:08.227,00:12:11.313,"I live in Washington. Washington, DC."
00:12:12.273,00:12:14.650,Or I did before.
00:12:16.444,00:12:18.279,I wonder if we're still in Brooklyn.
00:12:18.362,00:12:19.780,The apartment moves?
00:12:20.364,00:12:21.866,When it needs fresh meat.
00:12:24.702,00:12:26.120,Not literally. Jeez.
00:12:28.080,00:12:29.790,Thought you wrote scary stories.
00:12:31.876,00:12:32.710,Not anymore.
00:12:38.758,00:12:39.633,Ta-da.
00:12:49.143,00:12:50.269,Whoa!
00:12:52.646,00:12:54.398,This is so cool.
00:12:57.151,00:12:58.986,"I mean, wow!"
00:13:00.154,00:13:01.155,It can't be.
00:13:04.158,00:13:04.992,Hello!
00:13:09.330,00:13:10.873,How is this even possible?
00:13:12.124,00:13:14.043,The apartment can do two things.
00:13:16.587,00:13:23.719,"It lures suckers like us in, and it has room to hold… This is so cool."
00:13:23.803,00:13:26.305,"…well, anything."
00:13:26.806,00:13:28.974,The Empty Classroom and Other Creepy Stories.
00:13:29.475,00:13:31.227,Nightdreams and Daymares.
00:13:32.353,00:13:33.521,Whispered Tales.
00:13:34.063,00:13:35.731,She does like stories.
00:13:36.816,00:13:39.777,I thought you said you weren't into that kinda stuff anymore.
00:13:40.361,00:13:43.697,"-I'm not. It's my friend. -Oh, it's your friend?"
00:13:43.781,00:13:46.408,"He, uh… he'd like all this stuff."
00:13:47.993,00:13:49.078,But me? Nah.
00:13:49.161,00:13:51.705,"-He's, like… he's really lame. -Yeah, he sounds lame."
00:13:52.998,00:13:54.375,"Hmm. Cool. Okay, yeah."
00:13:54.458,00:14:01.465,"So she makes me read her a stupid scary story every night, but she says everything in here's already been read."
00:14:04.635,00:14:05.469,Everything?
00:14:07.930,00:14:09.849,Good thing you're a storyteller.
00:14:11.058,00:14:13.227,"She needs you, so get to work."
00:14:13.811,00:14:16.397,You heard her. She wants a scary story tonight.
00:14:16.981,00:14:19.191,"Every day, write as many stories as you can."
00:14:19.275,00:14:21.360,I don't write-- Cut the crap.
00:14:21.443,00:14:24.613,"I heard you last night, talking about your Nightbook thingies."
00:14:25.322,00:14:26.490,"Oh, those."
00:14:27.324,00:14:29.285,I'm over the whole writing thing.
00:14:29.368,00:14:35.583,"Then you better get over getting over it and crank out some new tales, 'cause if you don't-- She'll kill me. I know."
00:14:36.166,00:14:38.168,You'll be lucky if she kills you.
00:14:38.711,00:14:40.212,This is your life now.
00:14:40.713,00:14:45.718,Forget your family. Forget your friends. Focus on being useful to Natacha.
00:14:45.801,00:14:46.802,You wanna live?
00:14:48.095,00:14:49.805,Write scary stories.
00:14:53.434,00:14:57.354,"I'm not gonna write anything, 'cause I'm getting out of here."
00:15:08.407,00:15:09.450,Where are you?
00:15:28.969,00:15:29.929,Another exit.
00:16:11.637,00:16:12.554,Damn.
00:16:14.056,00:16:15.265,Every time.
00:16:15.975,00:16:18.769,You all try and run.
00:16:18.852,00:16:20.396,There's no escape.
00:16:21.647,00:16:22.773,You understand?
00:16:43.210,00:16:48.215,Hmm. Were you purposely making me wait?
00:16:50.092,00:16:52.803,-No. I… I was doing the dishes. -Sit there.
00:17:19.788,00:17:21.874,Give me a minute to get settled.
00:17:21.957,00:17:23.208,"I mean, honestly!"
00:17:31.050,00:17:31.967,What is that?
00:17:32.051,00:17:36.430,Do you know what happens to children who ask too many questions?
00:17:38.640,00:17:40.267,Do you wanna find out?
00:17:49.651,00:17:56.200,"So, Storyteller, you tried to escape today."
00:17:57.618,00:18:01.789,"Yasmin, too, had a little rebellious streak."
00:18:02.372,00:18:05.876,But I am curious about one thing.
00:18:06.418,00:18:11.548,Why burn your stories?
00:18:17.888,00:18:19.389,What is that?
00:18:20.516,00:18:22.101,Read. Now.
00:18:32.194,00:18:34.530,his heart shattered into a thousand pieces.
00:18:34.613,00:18:36.865,Shattered heart? I like it already.
00:18:46.959,00:18:48.293,They all knew the legend.
00:18:48.377,00:18:51.797,"In the hour before daylight, the dead kids would come out and play."
00:18:51.880,00:18:54.299,"Nope. No, no, no. Sorry, nope."
00:18:54.383,00:19:00.180,"Everyone knows that ghosts haunt places that are personal to them, not public places."
00:19:00.264,00:19:02.266,"Uh, are… are you sure?"
00:19:03.725,00:19:05.185,I'm sure.
00:19:07.146,00:19:08.313,Get on with it.
00:19:13.485,00:19:27.374,"And as soon as his foot crosses the threshold, children… Suddenly, a boy shoots out of the slide."
00:19:27.457,00:19:31.420,"Maybe he's ten or so, dressed like a newsie from the '20s."
00:19:31.503,00:19:33.338,Rude. You could at least say hi.
00:19:33.422,00:19:34.298,Hey… hey.
00:19:34.798,00:19:36.091,I… I mean… I mean hi.
00:19:37.384,00:19:39.094,"I'm looking for my friend, Jenny."
00:19:43.182,00:19:45.350,"To find her, you have to play."
00:19:49.271,00:19:53.692,Their skin is deathly white. Some of their clothes date back decades.
00:19:53.775,00:20:04.328,"They push Todd on a swing, higher and higher-- Everyone knows ghosts don't have actual physical hands, so they could never push him on a swing."
00:20:04.411,00:20:05.412,Amateur.
00:20:09.124,00:20:14.421,"The playground is… it's an interdimensional plane, a mix between the spirit world and the real world."
00:20:14.504,00:20:17.299,"Oh, so you're a quantum physicist now?"
00:20:28.060,00:20:30.479,and they pull Todd to a rusty merry-go-round.
00:20:30.562,00:20:35.776,"They spin him around and around, faster and faster, making Todd dizzier and dizzier."
00:20:35.859,00:20:38.320,Then the ghosts force Todd onto a seesaw.
00:20:38.403,00:20:39.571,He holds on tight.
00:20:39.655,00:20:41.823,"Suddenly, Todd realizes what they're up to."
00:20:41.907,00:20:48.247,Any living child still on the playground when the sun rises is cursed to remain there forever.
00:20:48.330,00:20:54.378,"He stumbles towards the gate, desperate to get out, but his world is spinning, and he's tripping over his own feet."
00:20:54.461,00:20:57.172,The sun's almost up. He's nearly out of time.
00:20:57.256,00:20:59.716,All the ghost children watch in suspense.
00:21:00.384,00:21:02.010,Todd's not going to make it.
00:21:02.094,00:21:05.180,"Until suddenly, someone grabs him and pulls him towards the exit."
00:21:05.264,00:21:06.390,It's Jenny!
00:21:07.724,00:21:13.855,"'Jenny, I… I wanted to see you.' 'Get out of here,' Jenny says, not stopping for a happy reunion."
00:21:17.150,00:21:19.903,Seeing his old friend again makes Todd's heart hurt.
00:21:19.987,00:21:22.572,I miss you. I don't wanna let you go.
00:21:23.865,00:21:26.785,Jenny discovered something that Todd is about to learn.
00:21:26.868,00:21:28.662,"Friends never let go, Todd."
00:21:35.669,00:21:36.586,here.
00:21:56.898,00:21:58.442,A happy ending?
00:22:02.946,00:22:04.740,"No happy endings, you fool."
00:22:08.118,00:22:11.496,Jenny… Jenny's dead. She's… she's trapped on the playground forever.
00:22:17.377,00:22:22.007,"He… he… he glances behind him, and he's pulled into the playground."
00:22:22.090,00:22:24.676,"He… he screams for help, but it's no use."
00:22:24.760,00:22:27.846,His ghostly soul is trapped there to this very day.
00:22:47.157,00:22:48.283,Never forget that.
00:22:49.576,00:22:53.163,"Did you at least like the story? I mean, until the ending?"
00:22:57.167,00:22:59.503,"You're still alive, aren't you?"
00:23:11.264,00:23:14.226,"I'm mystified by you, Storyteller."
00:23:15.560,00:23:21.400,This beautiful darkness dances inside your brain.
00:23:22.025,00:23:23.693,You should celebrate it.
00:23:24.861,00:23:26.071,But you run from it.
00:23:26.571,00:23:27.406,Why?
00:23:29.658,00:23:40.544,I just… You wrote all this today?
00:23:40.627,00:23:43.922,"Uh, I had… I had trouble writing today."
00:23:44.506,00:23:45.507,What?
00:23:45.590,00:23:49.428,It's just hard to concentrate with someone staring at me all day.
00:23:52.973,00:23:57.102,"I told you, show him the library and then get out."
00:23:57.185,00:23:58.061,Wait! Wait!
00:24:00.230,00:24:01.481,Not her! Not her.
00:24:03.650,00:24:05.402,You were disturbing him.
00:24:09.406,00:24:11.992,You know how important it is.
00:24:13.160,00:24:14.411,Wait!
00:24:17.456,00:24:19.291,It… it wasn't her fault either.
00:24:23.378,00:24:30.302,"Well, if it wasn't Yasmin's fault, and it wasn't Lenore's fault, then whose fault was it?"
00:24:31.761,00:24:35.098,Mine. I'll… I'll write faster.
00:24:39.603,00:24:41.605,"No more excuses, Storyteller."
00:24:54.367,00:24:55.535,Leave me alone.
00:24:58.788,00:25:01.333,I wasn't trying to get you in any kind of trouble.
00:25:01.416,00:25:05.378,"Yasmin, I'm sorry. I didn't know about the no happy endings thing."
00:25:07.589,00:25:09.674,Todd shouldn't have gone back for Jenny.
00:25:11.635,00:25:13.970,"-He was stupid. -No, he wasn't."
00:25:14.054,00:25:16.306,"He was her friend, and that's what friends do."
00:25:16.806,00:25:18.517,Maybe in fairy tales.
00:25:18.600,00:25:21.269,"But in here? She's right, you know."
00:25:22.479,00:25:24.189,Happy endings don't exist.
00:25:44.084,00:25:44.918,What?
00:25:45.418,00:25:46.836,What… what is that?
00:26:06.356,00:26:07.649,This place sucks.
00:26:13.154,00:26:16.491,She wants stories? Fine. I'll give her some stories.
00:26:27.419,00:26:29.588,"Yes! Yes, a haunted desk!"
00:26:29.671,00:26:32.757,Haunted by the spirit of somebody who died working at it.
00:26:32.841,00:26:35.468,"No, no, it's stupid. They're gonna think it's stupid."
00:26:35.552,00:26:37.220,How long you been here for?
00:26:37.721,00:26:38.972,Looks like a while.
00:26:39.681,00:26:40.974,How'd they get you?
00:26:41.057,00:26:43.893,They got me with a piece of pie and Lost Boys.
00:26:51.568,00:26:55.780,"Once upon a time, Alex stared up at the ceiling."
00:26:56.281,00:27:01.828,Then the ceiling fell on him and put him out of his misery.
00:27:02.454,00:27:03.330,The end.
00:27:09.586,00:27:10.629,What's up there?
00:27:46.498,00:27:48.208,It's the oldest book in here.
00:27:48.958,00:27:51.544,"This thing's gotta be, like, a thousand years old."
00:27:56.508,00:28:00.095,Kinder und Hausmärchen.
00:28:06.184,00:28:07.352,Rumpelstiltskin.
00:28:11.981,00:28:13.566,Sleeping Beauty?
00:28:15.318,00:28:16.277,Wow!
00:28:20.115,00:28:21.449,Hansel and Gretel.
00:28:23.868,00:28:25.745,Is that a ballpoint pen?
00:29:00.029,00:29:01.531,Wow. Frankenstein.
00:29:10.248,00:29:11.416,Oh my God.
00:29:13.501,00:29:14.335,It's writing.
00:29:17.380,00:29:23.720,"If I don't make it out of here, I need someone to know what happened, even if it's only the characters in these books."
00:29:23.803,00:29:25.221,I saw a unicorn.
00:29:25.847,00:29:28.183,"People said they didn't exist, but there it was."
00:29:28.266,00:29:32.437,"I followed it into this apartment, and now I'm trapped by a witch."
00:29:33.021,00:29:34.564,She's mean and scary.
00:29:46.409,00:29:51.164,I just have to do what the witch tells me to until Mom and Dad find me.
00:29:51.247,00:29:54.209,There are other kids here. Most of them are nice.
00:29:54.292,00:29:57.170,"I'm scared, but at least I'm not alone."
00:30:03.343,00:30:04.511,Dinner in an hour.
00:30:04.594,00:30:08.139,"Hey, Yasmin, do you like unicorns?"
00:30:09.390,00:30:11.518,"Yeah, 'cause that's so me."
00:30:11.601,00:30:15.230,"Oh, I thought maybe that's how she got you."
00:30:16.022,00:30:17.357,"Natacha, I mean."
00:30:18.066,00:30:20.026,You're right. It's none of my business.
00:30:20.109,00:30:24.072,And I bet you weren't lured in by a stupid movie and a piece of pie.
00:30:24.656,00:30:26.115,Stupid pumpkin pie.
00:30:28.743,00:30:29.786,Fine.
00:30:30.954,00:30:32.288,It was doro wat.
00:30:33.623,00:30:35.333,What the hell is doro wat?
00:30:36.459,00:30:43.508,"Chicken, onions caramelized in spiced butter, paprika, garlic, ginger, berbere spice."
00:30:44.717,00:30:49.556,My āyatē… My grandmother and I used to make it before she died.
00:30:50.807,00:30:53.309,We even grew all the herbs and veggies ourselves.
00:30:54.727,00:31:01.442,"Anyways, I smelled doro wat, and I just so badly wanted to see my āyatē again."
00:31:05.697,00:31:06.781,But it wasn't her.
00:31:08.199,00:31:11.911,"It was a witch, an evil, wicked witch."
00:31:14.664,00:31:16.332,How's that for a happy ending?
00:31:35.852,00:31:38.396,and Katie discovered that her hunch was right.
00:31:38.479,00:31:41.482,"To a vampire, blood does taste like candy."
00:31:41.566,00:31:46.738,Everybody knows it takes two days to grow full fangs.
00:31:46.821,00:31:48.239,You're stupid.
00:32:09.093,00:32:12.263,There's gotta be more writing from that Unicorn Girl.
00:32:12.347,00:32:15.183,…but it's too late. The roller coaster plunges down the drop.
00:32:15.266,00:32:25.818,"Steel snaps, metal shrieks, humans scream, and the grim reaper's dog laughs at the carnage."
00:32:26.569,00:32:29.739,The grim reaper doesn't have a pet.
00:32:30.406,00:32:31.950,"Isn't that right, Lenore?"
00:32:46.047,00:32:47.757,This is gonna take forever!
00:33:04.607,00:33:08.277,"They saw their son's footprints in the snow, leading into the woods."
00:33:08.361,00:33:12.532,"Then they saw a pair of smaller footprints, teddy-bear-sized."
00:33:13.574,00:33:16.035,And they never saw their precious son again.
00:33:19.956,00:33:21.874,Took me right out of the story.
00:33:21.958,00:33:26.045,Every good story hints at truth.
00:33:26.629,00:33:29.799,"The more truth, the more powerful the story."
00:33:30.591,00:33:34.512,"From now on, get your facts straight."
00:33:46.899,00:33:47.734,Yes!
00:33:50.820,00:33:53.281,I don't know how long I've been here.
00:33:53.364,00:33:56.367,I still have the necklace Mom and Dad gave me.
00:33:56.951,00:34:00.955,"I used to touch it to remember them, but I stopped."
00:34:01.039,00:34:02.665,It made me cry.
00:34:03.166,00:34:04.584,I'm tired of crying.
00:34:07.628,00:34:09.881,I have what I need to escape tonight.
00:34:09.964,00:34:12.675,"I'm finally going to see them again, Mom and Dad."
00:34:12.759,00:34:14.635,I wonder if they'll even know me.
00:34:14.719,00:34:16.596,Can people forget their kids?
00:34:29.067,00:34:31.277,You did not just throw a book at me!
00:34:31.360,00:34:33.154,"Uh, no. You just surprised me."
00:34:33.237,00:34:34.238,I dropped it.
00:34:34.322,00:34:36.282,Hold on. I'm coming down.
00:34:38.117,00:34:41.954,"Hey, Yasmin, wait until you see what I found."
00:34:43.998,00:34:46.250,"Hey, what's wrong?"
00:34:58.763,00:35:00.515,This is Natacha's night nursery.
00:35:00.598,00:35:01.641,Night nursery?
00:35:01.724,00:35:04.352,Yeah. Sunlight is bad for magical plants.
00:35:04.435,00:35:05.269,Come on.
00:35:22.912,00:35:24.539,What's all this for?
00:35:25.123,00:35:27.667,"Ingredients mostly, for Natacha's potions."
00:35:32.505,00:35:34.423,Don't touch anything.
00:35:39.053,00:35:40.012,What's that?
00:35:40.596,00:35:41.848,Demon silk.
00:35:41.931,00:35:44.058,Enough questions. Help me with this.
00:35:44.142,00:35:47.186,I watered the vine with rat's blood instead of bat's blood.
00:35:47.270,00:35:53.484,"Now, Shredder eggs are growing on it. If one of them hatches, it can destroy the night nursery, and Natacha will kill me."
00:36:27.143,00:36:28.644,Be careful. Don't jostle it.
00:36:29.395,00:36:30.229,Be careful.
00:36:35.818,00:36:37.737,"Okay, now what?"
00:36:38.863,00:36:41.449,Stomp it as hard as you can.
00:36:48.331,00:36:49.332,Good.
00:36:58.216,00:37:00.259,"The mist, do you think it keeps Natacha young?"
00:37:00.343,00:37:03.054,It's none of our business.
00:37:03.137,00:37:08.601,"I mean, she's really pretty, but her books are ancient, and the apartment looks like a granny decorated it."
00:37:25.326,00:37:54.105,I thought for sure it was gonna-- It's getting away!
00:37:56.774,00:37:57.858,-No! No! -No!
00:37:58.651,00:38:01.696,It's cutting down the Shredder eggs! Stomp on them!
00:38:15.960,00:38:17.003,Sorry.
00:38:20.840,00:38:22.675,That's all the Shredder eggs.
00:38:37.481,00:38:38.316,"Thanks, Yas."
00:38:43.070,00:38:45.239,Wait. Where is it?
00:38:56.917,00:39:00.004,We need to find it and kill it before it destroys the whole place.
00:39:57.728,00:39:59.855,I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.
00:40:44.442,00:40:45.317,Let's go!
00:40:47.445,00:40:48.654,-Come on! -Wait.
00:41:13.512,00:41:15.014,Now let's get out of here.
00:41:54.512,00:42:00.392,You useless little twits.
00:42:01.477,00:42:04.647,You've been misbehaving in my garden.
00:42:16.700,00:42:17.952,if I cared.
00:42:19.537,00:42:21.705,Do try to keep your eyes open.
00:42:22.748,00:42:25.042,I would hate to have to start over.
00:42:41.850,00:42:43.185,It was my fault!
00:42:44.311,00:42:46.272,I begged Yasmin to take me to the nursery.
00:42:46.355,00:42:50.234,I thought the creepy plants might help me think of something cool to write about.
00:42:51.610,00:42:54.780,"She made me promise not to touch anything, but I did."
00:42:57.241,00:42:59.535,Don't hurt her. Please.
00:43:11.755,00:43:18.345,"That is very brave of you, Storyteller, to lie right to my face."
00:43:28.439,00:43:29.857,I almost killed you.
00:43:32.484,00:43:35.070,"If I didn't need you to clean up the mess, I would've."
00:43:35.821,00:43:37.323,No more chances.
00:43:43.329,00:43:46.123,"Yas, you okay?"
00:43:46.707,00:43:51.211,"Look, I'm sorry I got you involved."
00:43:53.380,00:43:56.884,"From now on, you help yourself. I'll help myself."
00:44:02.765,00:44:04.141,It's not Yas.
00:44:09.021,00:44:10.105,It's Yasmin.
00:45:39.653,00:45:44.908,One… three!
00:45:50.706,00:45:54.084,Get… get off me! Get off me! Get off!
00:46:10.017,00:46:11.059,Oh my God.
00:46:11.143,00:46:13.771,No! No! No! No! No! No! No!
00:46:17.858,00:46:19.693,Ugh! My Nightbooks.
00:46:43.217,00:46:44.802,Lenore's here somewhere.
00:46:53.727,00:46:56.814,I made this. It'll help with the scrapes and cuts.
00:47:00.651,00:47:03.153,You made this for me?
00:47:04.780,00:47:06.532,"Yeah, it's my own concoction."
00:47:07.658,00:47:11.036,"It's a kind of aloe from a harpy plant, some dried corpse-hair vine."
00:47:13.956,00:47:16.375,That's good. Really good.
00:47:16.458,00:47:17.292,Thanks.
00:47:19.586,00:47:20.963,"Uh, Lenore?"
00:47:27.469,00:47:29.137,Look what Yas made for us.
00:47:29.221,00:47:30.764,Didn't make it for her.
00:47:33.976,00:47:35.394,It's okay. Here we go.
00:47:35.477,00:47:36.311,No.
00:47:43.068,00:47:44.319,I'm in trouble.
00:47:44.403,00:47:46.697,I… I… I don't have any stories.
00:47:46.780,00:47:49.908,What do you mean you don't have any? You said you had a bunch of them.
00:47:49.992,00:47:52.452,"I did, but a Shredder, it got into my room."
00:47:52.536,00:47:57.749,"And I killed it, but it destroyed all of my Nightbooks, except for this one."
00:47:57.833,00:48:00.377,I was reading to Natacha from those Nightbooks.
00:48:00.460,00:48:04.464,I've got nothing now. I… I have to escape. I have no choice!
00:48:04.548,00:48:15.183,There are two ways out. The front door where you came in and the back door-- The back door! It goes outside. I saw Natacha go through there. There's-- But Natacha's the only one that has the keys to that door.
00:48:15.267,00:48:18.061,You need to get over this escape nonsense and write something.
00:48:18.145,00:48:20.105,-I've been trying! -Try harder!
00:48:20.188,00:48:21.815,I can't write!
00:48:26.236,00:48:29.531,-I'll be useless to her. She'll kill me. -She won't just kill you.
00:48:37.331,00:48:38.707,There were four of us.
00:48:38.790,00:48:43.086,"Eli, Little Hwan, Claire, and me."
00:48:45.047,00:48:48.842,"Hwan was too young, but the rest of us took turns reading to Natacha."
00:48:50.135,00:48:56.183,"Afterwards, we'd all huddle together at night and dream about escaping."
00:49:03.148,00:49:05.108,"Last night, I almost joined them."
00:49:06.693,00:49:08.946,"One day, the kitchen sink got clogged."
00:49:10.280,00:49:12.199,Natacha's magic couldn't fix it.
00:49:15.369,00:49:18.956,That's because I blocked the pipe myself with starstell moss.
00:49:21.625,00:49:23.210,The moss resists magic.
00:49:33.011,00:49:37.432,"I taped a note under the sink for him to find, begging him to get help."
00:49:38.809,00:49:42.980,But… he never came.
00:49:44.982,00:49:47.192,"Natacha found the note, didn't she?"
00:49:47.275,00:49:54.116,Claire spent her last moments convincing Natacha that she did it… not me.
00:49:57.119,00:50:00.038,Claire lied to save me.
00:50:02.499,00:50:05.419,Like… you did.
00:50:07.796,00:50:09.589,'Cause that's what friends do.
00:50:18.432,00:50:22.519,but then I decided to stop.
00:50:22.602,00:50:30.235,And now that I have to write… the… the ideas won't come to me anymore.
00:50:39.244,00:50:40.704,Did Hwan wear a watch?
00:50:51.048,00:50:51.965,Why?
00:50:53.675,00:50:55.761,There's a way out of this place.
00:50:55.844,00:50:59.306,"-I have what I need to escape tonight. -Escape, Yasmin."
00:50:59.389,00:51:02.059,"I'm finally gonna see them again, Mom and Dad."
00:51:02.142,00:51:04.352,I wonder if they'll remember me.
00:51:04.436,00:51:06.396,Can people forget their kids?
00:51:07.856,00:51:12.319,"Unicorn Girl never took this off, and none of the kids in the cabinet are wearing it."
00:51:15.530,00:51:20.911,"You're right. And if she's not in the cabinet, then-- She did it. She escaped."
00:51:20.994,00:51:24.039,I've been piecing together her notes. There are bits here and there.
00:51:24.122,00:51:28.960,"She hid them throughout the books, so in case Natacha found out-- She wouldn't know her full plan."
00:51:32.297,00:51:33.673,"Okay, what's your plan?"
00:51:35.675,00:51:38.178,Your plan sucks. We're not gonna find this today.
00:51:38.261,00:51:40.013,You need to write a story for tonight.
00:51:41.890,00:51:43.183,What do we do?
00:51:43.266,00:51:46.770,"It'd take, like, a thousand years to search all these books."
00:51:49.940,00:51:51.024,A thousand years.
00:51:52.317,00:51:53.985,The thousand-year-old book.
00:51:55.320,00:51:57.572,The pen marks in the old book!
00:52:10.043,00:52:12.838,Come on. Please be here.
00:52:15.465,00:52:17.634,Is this the original Hansel and Gretel?
00:52:21.346,00:52:24.057,No one would just eat candy off of a strange house.
00:52:34.359,00:52:35.443,It smells awful.
00:52:35.527,00:52:38.572,I need to figure out how to hide the stink so she'll drink it.
00:52:38.655,00:52:41.825,I'm so close. I'll put her to sleep and steal her keys.
00:52:41.908,00:52:43.368,I wish I had magic.
00:52:43.451,00:52:46.788,I'd turn her into a toad or a snail and laugh at her all day long.
00:52:46.872,00:52:50.167,Then I would turn her into a centipede and rip off her legs.
00:52:50.250,00:52:53.044,"All hundred legs, one at a time."
00:52:55.463,00:52:58.175,I'll keep looking. You have to write a story.
00:53:01.928,00:53:04.806,You're the only one who can. You've gotta buy us more time.
00:53:06.016,00:53:07.559,You don't think I'm weird?
00:53:11.479,00:53:16.234,That I… I like to write scary stories?
00:53:17.903,00:53:18.778,Weird?
00:53:20.363,00:53:21.823,Who called you that?
00:53:23.617,00:53:25.702,"Well, they're right. You are weird."
00:53:27.370,00:53:28.788,"I mean, look at you."
00:53:30.665,00:53:34.377,But the thing that makes you weird makes them ordinary.
00:53:35.253,00:53:38.131,And no one likes to be ordinary. Ordinary sucks.
00:53:38.215,00:53:49.476,So ordinary people are gonna try and take that away from you… by calling you names like -Tryhard or-- -Creepshow.
00:53:52.103,00:53:54.231,"Yeah, or Creepshow."
00:53:58.360,00:53:59.444,"Thanks, Yasmin."
00:54:02.739,00:54:03.657,It's Yas.
00:54:07.118,00:54:08.745,Do you have those ingredients?
00:54:11.206,00:54:13.792,But she's right. Suckleweed stinks.
00:54:14.960,00:54:16.586,How did she mask the smell?
00:54:17.087,00:54:19.297,She must've found another ingredient.
00:54:22.717,00:54:24.219,but she would never tell us.
00:54:25.929,00:54:27.138,I do have an idea.
00:54:27.806,00:54:32.269,I could write a story to trick her into giving us the final ingredient of the sleeping potion.
00:54:47.158,00:54:48.702,You're happy with that one.
00:54:51.037,00:54:52.580,I don't like you happy.
00:54:53.164,00:54:56.751,I want a story that'll make you squirm.
00:54:58.086,00:54:59.879,Here's the story I want.
00:55:01.589,00:55:04.718,Why burn your Nightbooks?
00:55:04.801,00:55:07.762,"Uh… You thought I forgot about that, didn't you?"
00:55:08.805,00:55:21.109,I was… Uh… Oh my God.
00:55:21.693,00:55:23.611,I'm so sorry. I'm so stupid.
00:55:23.695,00:55:26.239,"Yes, you are. I've only been saying that for years."
00:55:27.949,00:55:29.409,Where was I?
00:55:29.492,00:55:31.411,You were about to tell me to start reading.
00:55:31.494,00:55:34.497,"Oh yes. Well then, what are you waiting for?"
00:55:34.581,00:55:35.498,Get on with it.
00:55:44.382,00:55:48.136,sent children to mine jewels from the mouth of the great monster.
00:55:55.769,00:56:05.070,"the evil sorcerer had a chance to kill the odious beast, but instead he used a powerful potion to keep the monster unconscious, to make himself rich."
00:56:05.153,00:56:08.198,Odious. Good word.
00:56:12.994,00:56:17.582,"down the monster's fifth ear, and the beast remained unconscious."
00:56:17.665,00:56:19.876,The recipe was as old as time.
00:56:19.959,00:56:25.215,"Dissolved rat's bones, dry-aged widow orchid, powdered beetle shells."
00:56:25.298,00:56:29.344,"But the most important ingredient, however, was bindweed."
00:56:29.928,00:56:33.973,Bindweed was the only thing that could hide the powerful stench of the potion.
00:56:34.057,00:56:37.852,"Without it, the rancid smell would rouse the great monster."
00:56:37.936,00:56:45.235,"But one day, the sorcerer went to harvest more bindweed, and he discovered that the entire field had withered and died."
00:56:45.735,00:56:48.113,The potion smelled worse than ever.
00:56:48.196,00:56:54.244,"Putrid, rank, malodorous-- Oh, yes, yes, yes. Understood. It stinks."
00:56:59.541,00:57:07.048,"He reluctantly raised his mighty staff to kill the beast, but a peasant girl came to him and promised a solution to his problem."
00:57:07.132,00:57:10.677,I know a replacement for bindweed. Your jewel harvest can continue.
00:57:10.760,00:57:13.555,Foolish child. You know nothing of real magic.
00:57:13.638,00:57:17.016,"I can prove it. And if I do, I want a bag of jewels."
00:57:17.517,00:57:20.270,"If it works, you will get two bags."
00:57:20.353,00:57:23.606,"If not, you will give me your life."
00:57:26.609,00:57:29.821,and poured a mysterious dark liquid into the jug.
00:57:31.364,00:57:33.575,The evil sorcerer sniffed the potion.
00:57:33.658,00:57:36.703,The smell disappeared. The sorcerer couldn't believe it.
00:57:37.287,00:57:48.965,"It smelled like daisies, roses, lilacs on a spring morning-- into the monster's ear and waited."
00:57:52.135,00:57:53.928,then went still again.
00:57:54.012,00:57:59.058,Yes! But the peasant girl had removed more than just the smell from the potion.
00:57:59.684,00:58:02.312,She'd also erased all of its magic.
00:58:02.896,00:58:05.648,The sorcerer's potion was rendered useless.
00:58:06.316,00:58:08.860,The peasant girl nodded to something behind him.
00:58:13.907,00:58:15.658,The sorcerer shrieked.
00:58:18.786,00:58:24.334,"The evil sorcerer had sent her baby brother into that cave, and he never returned."
00:58:24.834,00:58:26.878,The peasant girl cared nothing about jewels.
00:58:26.961,00:58:28.880,"She got what she wanted, revenge."
00:58:28.963,00:58:36.971,"And so she walked away as the monster's sharp teeth chomped down on the shrieking sorcerer, silencing him forever."
00:58:39.015,00:58:44.229,"Just as the peasant girl thought she'd gotten away with it all, a black shadow loomed over her."
00:58:44.312,00:58:47.440,"It was the monster's giant foot, right above her."
00:58:48.900,00:58:49.776,The end.
00:58:50.360,00:58:51.694,And not a happy one.
00:58:54.155,00:58:55.031,Bindweed?
00:58:55.865,00:58:58.409,"Yeah, me and Yasmin researched for hours."
00:58:58.493,00:59:06.709,I know how important it is to get all the details right-- No.
00:59:08.962,00:59:16.386,"I-- Of course I made up the potion's ingredients, but I was sure that bindweed hides odors."
00:59:17.804,00:59:21.391,"-I really thought we got it right. -Well, there's your mistake."
00:59:21.474,00:59:22.684,You worked with her.
00:59:23.643,00:59:27.355,Bindweed keeps liquid from separating.
00:59:29.440,00:59:34.988,"Everyone knows cinaroot hides smells, not bindweed."
00:59:38.074,00:59:40.827,"Cinaroot, of course."
00:59:44.080,00:59:46.958,Is that cinaroot with an S or a C?
01:00:18.990,01:00:19.824,Okay.
01:00:20.742,01:00:22.410,Let's do some science stuff.
01:00:37.508,01:00:39.302,"Tonight, we're getting out of here."
01:01:23.262,01:01:25.223,Oh my God. What's happening?
01:01:25.807,01:01:28.643,It's turning green. I can't bring this out there.
01:01:35.358,01:01:36.818,Some kind of reaction?
01:01:38.653,01:01:45.326,Maybe the acidity of the lemonade-- I don't have a story.
01:01:45.410,01:01:46.786,We put two drops in the glass.
01:01:46.869,01:01:49.414,-Let's put two in the pitcher. -Will it put her to sleep?
01:02:35.168,01:02:36.669,Where is my lemonade?
01:02:37.628,01:02:38.463,It's coming!
01:02:40.381,01:02:42.800,What? I put it right here.
01:02:45.470,01:02:47.346,-Where is it? -What are you talking about?
01:02:47.430,01:02:49.807,Where is the potion? This has to happen.
01:02:54.729,01:02:55.646,She knows.
01:03:11.704,01:03:32.558,"Uh… So, uh… So it's… It's gotta… It's… Hmm."
01:03:35.394,01:03:36.312,Let's see.
01:03:37.063,01:03:45.738,"So, um… Any day now, Storyteller."
01:03:46.239,01:03:49.659,"Yeah, yeah. It's, uh… it's here somewhere."
01:03:53.788,01:03:55.414,Spit it out.
01:03:55.498,01:03:56.791,"Oh, okay."
01:04:02.421,01:04:04.423,-I just gotta find it. -Read!
01:04:09.929,01:04:10.847,Hmm.
01:04:14.267,01:04:19.605,"So, um, this one is, um, called The Cuckoo Clock."
01:04:30.867,01:04:35.329,he thought it was just another old-timey piece of junk.
01:04:35.913,01:04:40.084,But there was something strange about the clock.
01:04:40.167,01:04:50.595,"Every hour on the hour, the little cuckoo would pop out, and, uh, Steve started to notice-- Who's Steve?"
01:04:50.678,01:04:53.014,I thought you said his name was Scott.
01:04:55.975,01:05:02.356,"So… so Scott noticed that, uh, the cuckoo seemed to look a little bit different every time it appeared."
01:05:02.440,01:05:14.243,"Like, its eyes would-- -What is this? -Uh… Where are all your stories, the ones that you're supposed to be writing every day?"
01:05:14.785,01:05:17.371,-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -Where are your new stories?
01:05:17.455,01:05:19.790,"The Shredder, it got into my backpack."
01:05:20.917,01:05:24.045,The Shredder ate your homework?
01:05:30.426,01:05:41.812,Thorns in my side… I'll make you the recipe. I-- Please. You can barely follow a recipe.
01:05:41.896,01:05:43.356,He writes for you! You need him!
01:05:46.567,01:05:48.152,"Hmm, let's face it."
01:05:49.737,01:05:51.781,This is long overdue.
01:06:22.144,01:06:22.979,What?
01:06:25.356,01:06:27.066,Don't touch her. Don't touch.
01:06:47.336,01:06:48.796,What's… what's happening?
01:06:57.013,01:06:59.181,Poor little thing. What happened to you?
01:06:59.265,01:07:01.308,Lenore put our potion in the bottle of mist.
01:07:08.315,01:07:10.818,She must've gotten a dose of the sleeping potion.
01:07:13.446,01:07:16.407,"She's a prisoner, just like us."
01:07:18.367,01:07:21.245,"-Thank you, Lenore. -Alex, we did it."
01:07:30.129,01:07:32.006,How's that for following a recipe?
01:07:42.016,01:07:43.893,Wait. Where do you think it goes?
01:07:45.436,01:07:46.270,Home.
01:08:17.635,01:08:19.553,Never thought I'd see trees again.
01:08:24.183,01:08:25.017,Look.
01:08:32.191,01:08:34.318,I'm never gonna eat peanut butter ever again!
01:08:36.570,01:08:39.532,First food when I get back? Vanilla milkshake!
01:08:42.201,01:08:45.955,"Whoa, whoa, wait, Alex. Hold up. Hold up. Just wait a second."
01:08:51.335,01:08:52.545,That's widow's grub.
01:08:53.129,01:08:54.713,That's sunken lily.
01:08:56.006,01:08:57.007,Why is that here?
01:09:11.063,01:09:12.606,"No, no, no. Alex! Alex!"
01:09:13.274,01:09:15.151,Alex! Alex!
01:09:15.985,01:09:18.696,"The door, it wasn't the way out."
01:09:20.156,01:09:21.866,We're still in the apartment.
01:09:53.981,01:09:54.815,Run!
01:10:59.505,01:11:02.216,Every good story hints at truth.
01:11:05.177,01:11:06.178,Oh my God.
01:11:06.762,01:11:10.391,Hansel and Gretel was real.
01:11:12.393,01:11:13.269,Yas?
01:11:15.437,01:11:17.773,It smells so delicious.
01:11:26.740,01:11:29.118,So hungry.
01:11:35.749,01:11:36.875,Yas!
01:12:07.906,01:12:09.867,"We… we shouldn't be in here, Yas."
01:12:18.584,01:12:19.418,Yas?
01:12:22.129,01:12:22.963,Hello?
01:12:27.634,01:12:29.762,"Yas, what's wrong with you?"
01:12:32.222,01:12:33.057,Yas?
01:13:21.063,01:13:21.980,Yas?
01:13:24.691,01:13:25.776,Lenore?
01:13:33.867,01:13:34.701,Yasmin?
01:13:47.089,01:13:48.173,Yasmin!
01:13:54.096,01:13:55.389,Yasmin!
01:14:02.396,01:14:03.355,I'm… I'm okay.
01:14:03.981,01:14:05.315,This is probably fine.
01:14:42.394,01:14:44.438,Sleeping Beauty awakes.
01:14:45.772,01:14:48.233,"Oh, wait. Wrong story."
01:14:57.951,01:14:59.036,We're okay.
01:15:22.226,01:15:25.187,"The mist, that's where it comes from."
01:15:25.896,01:15:27.272,You're harvesting it.
01:15:27.898,01:15:29.983,Who's inside that coffin?
01:15:35.531,01:15:39.660,"who, by the way, does eat children."
01:15:40.827,01:15:44.665,We thought you were the original witch. We thought the blue mist kept you young.
01:15:44.748,01:15:47.876,I don't need the mist to keep me young.
01:15:47.960,01:15:49.545,It gives me her magic.
01:15:49.628,01:15:50.462,What?
01:15:51.046,01:15:52.130,How?
01:15:52.631,01:15:55.467,I was about your age when she got me.
01:15:55.968,01:15:58.095,There were lots of us back then.
01:15:59.096,01:16:01.223,But we weren't dumb.
01:16:02.015,01:16:07.604,"We knew not to get attached, because she got hungry."
01:16:08.105,01:16:09.273,She ate them?
01:16:12.025,01:16:13.151,Yes.
01:16:15.946,01:16:17.114,All of them.
01:16:27.874,01:16:29.960,I pretended to like her.
01:16:30.544,01:16:33.130,Pretended to want to be like her.
01:16:33.213,01:16:35.007,I became her favorite.
01:16:35.924,01:16:39.928,"But when I was alone, I plotted my escape."
01:16:42.889,01:16:45.017,I would get her to trust me.
01:16:47.519,01:16:52.482,"And then, a sleeping potion, and I would be free."
01:16:53.483,01:17:06.038,I ran straight home… but my parents were gone.
01:17:07.414,01:17:08.540,They left you.
01:17:11.668,01:17:13.879,so I came back here.
01:17:24.056,01:17:25.474,You were just like us.
01:17:27.976,01:17:28.810,Wait.
01:17:29.811,01:17:34.358,The sleeping potion… You're Unicorn Girl.
01:17:39.363,01:17:40.280,Ah.
01:17:41.948,01:17:44.076,You read my diaries.
01:17:48.205,01:17:49.581,Did you meet my pet?
01:17:50.082,01:17:51.541,The unicorn?
01:17:53.126,01:17:54.127,That's your pet?
01:17:54.753,01:17:55.754,I made him.
01:17:56.880,01:17:58.632,I make many things now.
01:18:16.149,01:18:18.902,Stories keep her asleep.
01:18:18.985,01:18:24.533,Stories of fear and suffering and death are like sweet lullabies to her.
01:18:26.118,01:18:27.244,I don't have a story.
01:18:27.327,01:18:28.537,"Oh, yes, you do."
01:18:28.620,01:18:32.040,Tell us the reason that you wanted to destroy your Nightbooks.
01:18:39.339,01:18:47.889,All that pain and fear and sadness that you've been avoiding this whole time.
01:18:47.973,01:18:48.890,Tell it!
01:18:55.522,01:18:56.565,"Now, Alex!"
01:18:56.648,01:18:58.316,You think I'm a bad witch?
01:18:59.067,01:19:01.653,Just wait until she wakes up and sees you.
01:19:02.237,01:19:06.366,"So young, so plump, so juicy-- Okay! Okay!"
01:19:17.544,01:19:22.883,"Every day, on his free time, he would come up with new ways to scare his classmates."
01:19:35.687,01:19:39.065,…they just didn't get his fascination with creepy things.
01:19:39.149,01:19:43.195,"To them, he was just… weird."
01:19:44.029,01:19:46.239,What's wrong with you? they'd ask.
01:19:46.740,01:19:52.329,"Many of them were cruel, calling him names, like Creepshow."
01:19:54.331,01:19:55.499,Except for Joshua.
01:19:56.500,01:20:00.504,Josh was his best friend since kindergarten.
01:20:02.005,01:20:06.426,"Alex finishes his latest bone-chilling tale, and he's excited to share it."
01:20:08.011,01:20:09.930,"Hey, you're gonna love this one."
01:20:10.430,01:20:11.389,Josh?
01:20:12.557,01:20:14.518,"Hey, Josh?"
01:20:21.399,01:20:23.401,Wait. My birthday's tonight.
01:20:23.485,01:20:25.737,We turned the apartment into a haunted house.
01:20:25.821,01:20:28.657,It's amazing. I've got tons of new stories ready.
01:20:29.616,01:20:33.161,"Josh talks low, not wanting the others to hear."
01:20:33.245,01:20:35.247,Cody's having a gaming party.
01:20:35.330,01:20:37.415,His dad's getting the truck and everything.
01:20:38.166,01:20:41.127,But to… tonight's my party.
01:20:41.628,01:20:44.923,"…says Alex, confused and hurt."
01:20:45.590,01:20:48.426,Alex's hope sinks. He's desperate.
01:20:48.510,01:20:53.181,He says… You're my best friend.
01:20:54.057,01:20:55.892,Josh tries to be gentle.
01:20:56.476,01:20:57.477,"Yeah, right."
01:20:57.978,01:20:59.563,Cody's my friend now too.
01:20:59.646,01:21:07.279,"And you're just not… The way you dress, the things you like."
01:21:07.362,01:21:10.031,All you do is talk about your scary stories.
01:21:11.950,01:21:13.410,Everyone thinks it's weird.
01:21:16.705,01:21:18.456,"Yo, Josh, you comin'?"
01:21:18.540,01:21:19.624,"Come on, J-Man."
01:21:20.208,01:21:23.420,"All right, all right. Alex, I'll see you later, okay?"
01:21:28.800,01:21:32.470,The boy had written a new story about a haunted house.
01:21:36.683,01:21:39.311,had turned his whole apartment into that house.
01:21:42.397,01:21:47.569,No one showed up… not even Josh.
01:21:55.493,01:22:00.624,They made him hate the thing he loved most.
01:22:02.584,01:22:05.003,And they made him hate himself.
01:22:10.717,01:22:19.726,"The real truth is, he was embarrassed to be himself, so he decided to burn his Nightbooks."
01:22:20.894,01:22:24.022,He swore he'd never write another story again.
01:22:25.565,01:22:28.902,He could be a new person.
01:22:29.819,01:22:31.905,Not weird.
01:22:32.405,01:22:33.865,Not a freak.
01:22:34.366,01:22:39.788,"He could be normal, like Josh and his friends."
01:22:42.624,01:22:44.334,Then he wouldn't be alone.
01:22:56.221,01:23:03.853,"The boy lost all his friends, so he decided to destroy that part of himself that created the Nightbooks."
01:23:03.937,01:23:05.814,Then a witch captured him.
01:23:06.564,01:23:08.692,She said she liked his stories.
01:23:11.736,01:23:13.321,The witch was lying.
01:23:13.947,01:23:27.293,"But being captured by her was the best thing that ever happened to me… …because I made new friends, friends who love me for who I am, not for who they want me to be."
01:23:27.377,01:23:29.212,What have you done? No!
01:23:30.046,01:23:30.880,No!
01:23:35.010,01:23:37.429,-No! -This is our happy ending!
01:23:37.512,01:23:39.264,No happy endings.
01:23:44.144,01:23:46.938,"-Guys, let's get out of here. -Fine."
01:23:48.231,01:23:51.401,"Oh! No! No, you idiot!"
01:23:51.484,01:23:54.779,What have you done? You stupid children.
01:23:54.863,01:23:56.656,No! No!
01:24:31.483,01:24:32.901,Oh God.
01:25:10.772,01:25:11.731,You're awake.
01:25:12.565,01:25:13.525,Finally.
01:25:14.109,01:25:18.238,"You've been asleep here so long, the… the candy is infecting you."
01:25:19.531,01:25:25.245,You… You did this to me.
01:25:25.328,01:25:30.708,"I have lived in fear of you for so long, but I am not that little girl anymore."
01:25:34.838,01:25:36.381,Witch fight!
01:25:36.464,01:25:37.966,-Let's get out of here! -Let's go!
01:26:15.003,01:26:18.715,Help! We need help! Get us out of here!
01:26:18.798,01:26:21.009,A witch is gonna eat us!
01:26:21.092,01:26:22.135,Help!
01:26:22.635,01:26:24.429,Can anyone hear me?
01:26:34.314,01:26:35.190,Yas?
01:26:39.027,01:26:39.861,Yasmin?
01:26:45.617,01:26:46.576,Whoa!
01:26:47.744,01:26:48.703,You… you did it.
01:26:49.370,01:26:50.371,You did it.
01:27:04.177,01:27:06.596,We're still in my building. The apartment didn't move.
01:27:09.432,01:27:12.477,"-Do you have a plan? -Not exactly a plan, an idea."
01:27:22.362,01:27:25.240,I'm so hungry.
01:27:43.758,01:27:46.261,This is the worst elevator ever!
01:28:03.319,01:28:04.195,What now?
01:28:04.779,01:28:07.323,We just need to make it to that boiler room.
01:28:21.838,01:28:23.256,You gotta be kidding me.
01:28:48.906,01:28:51.743,-No! No! No! No! -No! No! No! No!
01:29:19.896,01:29:22.607,"No, let… let her go. It's me you want."
01:29:25.526,01:29:27.612,I want both of you.
01:29:27.695,01:29:28.654,No!
01:29:28.738,01:29:30.823,No. I'm sorry.
01:29:48.299,01:29:51.469,Stories about fear and death are like lullabies to her.
01:29:56.766,01:29:57.725,No!
01:30:00.311,01:30:01.729,She's read all of them.
01:30:03.731,01:30:05.233,"Hey, ugly."
01:30:06.567,01:30:09.362,You like stories? I got stories.
01:30:19.664,01:30:26.129,The fact that his sister died every Tuesday at 11:15 or that she always came back to life 20 minutes later.
01:30:26.212,01:30:28.339,More. Give me more.
01:30:31.509,01:30:35.805,Zachary had always thought that clowns were the scariest part of the circus.
01:30:35.888,01:30:37.223,He was wrong.
01:30:39.392,01:30:46.482,I found a package on my front porch addressed to the woman standing right behind you.
01:30:47.233,01:30:49.235,Who? Who was it?
01:30:49.318,01:30:50.778,Who was it?
01:31:15.553,01:31:17.722,Keep it shut! Keep pushing!
01:31:32.195,01:31:34.197,So that's why they call you a tryhard?
01:31:34.280,01:31:35.990,"Shut up, Creepshow."
01:31:40.077,01:31:41.287,"All right, skin-bag."
01:31:41.871,01:31:44.373,We didn't forget about you. Come here.
01:31:54.509,01:31:55.510,Let's go home.
01:32:15.279,01:32:16.822,Mom? Dad?
01:32:35.091,01:32:36.676,"-Hi. -Yas, for short."
01:33:30.354,01:33:31.897,"Oh God, you scared me."
01:33:34.775,01:33:36.861,"-Hey, Creepshow. -Hey, Tryhard."
01:33:37.361,01:33:39.614,My parents drove me up to surprise you.
01:33:39.697,01:33:42.617,"-What is that? Like, your third story? -Fourth, actually."
01:33:42.700,01:33:45.578,So you could definitely use this.
01:33:47.455,01:33:48.789,"Oh my God, Yas."
01:33:56.922,01:33:59.967,The effect of ultraviolet black light on photosynthetic organisms.
