00:00:46.088,00:00:58.517,"and the silent fear that, in the years since we saw each other, this war, this awful war, will have changed us both beyond all reckoning."
00:02:22.809,00:02:24.019,That's Mo Oakley's boy.
00:02:25.937,00:02:27.856,"Can't be old enough to fight, can he?"
00:02:35.238,00:02:37.032,"-Good morning. -Morning, son."
00:02:38.283,00:02:40.535,Got some boots and jackets. You want one?
00:02:40.994,00:02:43.246,-Here. You want that? -Thanks.
00:02:47.793,00:02:49.586,'cause they're taking me back to Cold Mountain.
00:02:58.679,00:03:00.555,and wish I could repair them.
00:03:02.557,00:03:06.311,"My awkward nature, the things left unsaid."
00:03:18.073,00:03:20.158,Enough powder here to blow a hole in the sky.
00:03:38.301,00:03:40.554,That old book of yours is in shreds.
00:03:47.519,00:03:52.566,"Hey, Oakley. Don't worry, son. Them Yankee boys keep store hours."
00:03:53.567,00:03:54.609,They ain't open yet.
00:04:05.245,00:04:06.246,Close it up.
00:04:30.312,00:04:31.563,That's my rabbit!
00:04:34.357,00:04:38.069,Get your paws off my rabbit! Get your paws off my rabbit!
00:04:41.656,00:04:42.657,Oh!
00:05:25.659,00:05:29.788,"I was so shy of how I looked, so out of place."
00:05:30.831,00:05:38.797,"But did you know how happy I was to escape from Charleston, from a world of slaves, and corsets and cotton?"
00:05:55.939,00:05:57.816,"I'm gonna go off, and kill me some Yankees."
00:06:15.000,00:06:17.752,Mr. Swanger! Good morning to you.
00:06:22.674,00:06:24.593,-Miss Monroe. -Good morning.
00:06:26.803,00:06:28.179,-…progress. -Morning.
00:06:28.471,00:06:30.432,"Mrs. Swanger, Mrs. Castlereagh."
00:06:30.515,00:06:32.976,"-Morning, reverend. -Now, if y'all will excuse me."
00:06:33.226,00:06:44.529,"In Charleston, my congregation would still be disputing Cold mountain must feel like the end of the world."
00:06:53.622,00:07:07.302,"Men up here had a bearing on what they thought a woman was, if you was to say a word to one of these fools, I could get my top field cleared."
00:07:08.762,00:07:18.772,"-Anyone? -No, uh… Won't normally say boo to a goose."
00:07:22.317,00:07:24.694,He's been pressin' me since the day you arrived here.
00:07:38.041,00:07:41.419,"Good morning, I'm Ada Monroe."
00:07:42.504,00:07:43.505,Inman.
00:07:44.381,00:07:47.425,-Inman. -WP Inman.
00:07:49.135,00:07:52.847,-WP Inman. -Repeatin' a thing doesn't improve it.
00:07:55.308,00:07:57.811,People call me Inman.
00:08:02.148,00:08:26.381,"If you were to take a glass of cider, Richie, I seen your house."
00:08:26.464,00:08:27.841,There ain't a square angle anywhere near it.
00:08:27.924,00:08:29.050,And what do you do?
00:08:30.343,00:08:31.386,I work wood.
00:08:32.637,00:08:33.638,Hunt.
00:08:35.557,00:08:36.933,Mostly work wood.
00:08:40.395,00:08:41.563,Clear fields?
00:08:46.609,00:08:47.819,I can clear a field.
00:08:50.071,00:08:53.033,Was there something in particular you wished to say to me?
00:08:58.496,00:08:59.748,Not that comes to me.
00:09:07.422,00:09:09.841,I'll say thank you for the cider.
00:11:08.626,00:11:10.879,Whole plan backfired on 'em.
00:11:26.019,00:11:27.520,It's a turkey shoot.
00:11:28.605,00:11:31.024,-What? -It's a turkey shoot.
00:11:31.107,00:11:35.069,They've run themselves into a hole. Hell's busted.
00:13:34.897,00:13:35.898,Oakley!
00:14:42.298,00:14:43.341,I got a few.
00:14:56.938,00:14:58.981,Your folks gonna be real proud of you.
00:15:13.371,00:15:16.833,"Son, this fellow says he'll play whatever you want."
00:15:20.420,00:15:23.381,What about Bonaparte's Retreat? That's one I play.
00:15:32.682,00:15:34.350,Like a girl's waiting for me.
00:15:36.519,00:15:37.520,You heard him.
00:15:38.855,00:15:40.398,I only know a couple of tunes.
00:15:43.901,00:15:48.656,and you're thirsty… and the water's so cool.
00:15:51.492,00:15:53.453,I don't know what music that is.
00:16:19.020,00:16:21.314,I'm reachin' Cold Mountain before you.
00:17:13.991,00:17:17.328,"-Oh, I've been missing it. -Thank you, by the way."
00:17:17.411,00:17:19.872,"Inman's in my top field, clearing his debt."
00:17:20.915,00:17:21.874,"Oh, dear."
00:17:26.837,00:17:29.090,And then he had nothing to say.
00:17:29.590,00:17:30.591,He was happy.
00:17:32.718,00:17:33.719,Really?
00:17:35.471,00:17:37.223,Are men so different in Charleston?
00:17:40.393,00:17:41.394,Men?
00:17:45.356,00:17:48.651,"If you're sayin' you might like him, why not go over and say good mornin'?"
00:17:51.320,00:17:52.780,I should be gettin' along.
00:17:59.579,00:18:00.580,Walk on.
00:18:11.674,00:18:13.718,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:18:51.422,00:18:55.384,"to help me in my ministry, and upon whom I rely."
00:18:57.803,00:19:21.077,"Friends, we are both very happy to have this opportunity tonight to thank you from our hearts for your kind welcome and, most of all, …thank you, and God bless you."
00:19:24.330,00:19:29.960,Our house is always open to any of you at any time.
00:19:33.172,00:19:34.173,Esco?
00:19:38.552,00:19:40.638,"That gentleman, he helped build the chapel?"
00:19:43.641,00:19:46.936,"At one time, the Teague family owned the whole of Cold Mountain."
00:19:47.603,00:19:51.941,"My farm, your farm. It all belonged to his grandpappy."
00:19:52.191,00:19:57.738,"Teague wanted this place bad when you got it, and he's here sniffin' out an advantage."
00:20:05.496,00:20:07.707,And that is a good thing in these troubled times.
00:20:15.506,00:20:19.051,-Were you never planning to come inside? -I'm wetter than a fish.
00:20:21.804,00:20:24.598,-There's a good fire going. -I'm all right.
00:20:27.727,00:20:29.311,You're always carrying a tray.
00:20:32.940,00:20:35.651,I was going to take some root beer over to the Negroes.
00:20:47.788,00:20:51.584,"-Are you? -If there is a war, we'll all fight."
00:21:05.306,00:21:07.933,-Did you get a picture made? -Say again?
00:21:08.267,00:21:12.938,"A tintype, with your musket, and your courage on display."
00:21:14.356,00:21:15.566,You're laughin' at me.
00:21:18.444,00:21:19.528,I don't know you.
00:21:24.575,00:21:26.076,This doesn't come out right.
00:21:31.916,00:21:36.295,without the words… It is.
00:21:40.382,00:21:41.383,It is.
00:21:45.888,00:21:51.060,You-- Look… look at the sky now. What color is it?
00:21:53.813,00:21:56.690,Or the way a hawk flies?
00:21:59.360,00:22:05.241,Or you wake up… and your ribs are bruised thinking so hard on somebody.
00:22:07.910,00:22:08.911,What do you call that?
00:22:18.879,00:22:19.880,I'll do that.
00:22:22.258,00:22:23.759,I can't get much wetter.
00:22:32.226,00:22:35.980,"You said after a few years, I would barely remember your name."
00:22:37.022,00:22:38.607,"Oh, Inman."
00:22:39.400,00:22:43.696,"It is more than three years, and I remember your name."
00:22:45.281,00:22:47.950,"Soldiers, don't get up."
00:22:50.119,00:22:56.250,You were mentioned tonight in my report. You men from Cold Mountain have once again been heroes for the cause.
00:22:57.293,00:23:00.921,"There are Yankees in that stand of trees between us, stuck there from the retreat."
00:23:01.255,00:23:05.467,"If they stay there, tomorrow mornin', they can shoot us down for sport."
00:23:51.055,00:23:53.057,I said hold your fire! Hold your fire.
00:24:40.479,00:24:44.942,I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting. It should just be a few seconds.
00:25:49.882,00:25:51.425,-Mr. Inman. -Reverend.
00:25:52.009,00:25:54.553,-What can I do for you? -I have some sheet music.
00:25:55.012,00:25:56.388,It belonged to my father.
00:25:57.473,00:25:59.475,-No use to me. -Thank you.
00:26:00.225,00:26:02.561,-You must come in. -I should probably get along.
00:26:02.644,00:26:05.022,Mr. Inman is more comfortable outdoors.
00:26:06.023,00:26:09.276,Perhaps we might… perhaps we might take a walk.
00:26:09.610,00:26:11.153,A splendid idea.
00:26:14.406,00:26:15.783,Let me just get your hat.
00:26:25.501,00:26:29.546,"because my doctors, they've been sayin' my chest is weak."
00:26:30.005,00:26:32.174,"So, the air's supposed to do me good."
00:26:33.759,00:26:35.886,But it's the view I think heals.
00:26:40.766,00:26:44.311,"I have no plans to preach war in my church, Mr. Inman."
00:26:46.355,00:26:50.359,I imagine God is weary of being called down on both sides of an argument.
00:26:54.279,00:26:55.781,I imagine God is.
00:27:02.788,00:27:03.789,Thank you.
00:27:06.375,00:27:08.794,"Now, your father played the piano, did he?"
00:28:16.570,00:28:18.947,-Secession. -North Carolina left the union.
00:28:26.455,00:28:28.582,Whoo! We got our war!
00:28:28.707,00:28:29.917,-Whoo! -Whoo!
00:28:57.027,00:28:59.905,We got our war! We got it! We got it!
00:29:23.470,00:29:25.180,It's a great day for North Carolina.
00:29:26.431,00:29:30.602,"Those who follow Lincoln, or preach abolition."
00:29:31.520,00:29:33.397,You best keep one eye open when you're sleepin'.
00:29:33.772,00:29:35.190,Ol' boogeyman might get you.
00:29:37.025,00:29:39.111,"Are you the law all of a sudden, Mr. Teague?"
00:29:40.404,00:29:41.488,"That's right, son."
00:29:42.614,00:29:46.034,"Home guard for Haywood County, and I'm the law from today."
00:29:46.702,00:29:47.995,Y'all go fight now.
00:29:48.912,00:29:50.455,We'll watch over your sweethearts.
00:30:01.883,00:30:03.552,You might be safer back in Charleston.
00:30:08.765,00:30:10.726,But then who'll be waiting for you?
00:30:13.353,00:30:14.938,-All right! -Three cheers for the South!
00:30:33.040,00:30:37.794,-Inman. It belongs to Inman. -I got it. He's here.
00:31:27.386,00:31:28.387,Wait.
00:31:38.897,00:31:43.902,I found you this book to take with you. William Bartram.
00:31:46.405,00:31:47.739,They tell me it's good.
00:31:49.991,00:31:56.123,"I think he writes about these parts, the author, so… Thank you."
00:31:58.542,00:32:10.220,And this… I'm not smiling in it.
00:32:14.099,00:32:15.559,I don't know how to do that.
00:32:16.768,00:32:18.019,Hold a smile.
00:32:42.627,00:32:44.087,-Ada. -What?
00:33:12.574,00:33:13.658,Kiss her for me.
00:33:29.549,00:33:30.967,I'll be waiting for you.
00:34:23.353,00:34:27.774,How many would still lose a leg for the rich man's slave?
00:34:28.608,00:34:33.572,"Most of these soldiers'll be dead by morning, or if they're stubborn, by nightfall."
00:34:34.281,00:35:02.225,"I've other men outside in the courtyard waitin' for beds, Pigeon River… I… I'm sorry. You want water?"
00:35:03.810,00:35:05.645,Cold Mountain.
00:35:19.951,00:35:21.244,From Mr. Inman?
00:35:23.121,00:35:24.122,Yes.
00:35:27.417,00:35:34.591,But then I've tried countin' the number of words which have passed between Mr. Inman and me. Not very many.
00:35:35.216,00:35:38.720,"But I think about him, daddy, all the time."
00:35:39.554,00:35:43.516,I lost your mother after 22 months of marriage.
00:35:45.602,00:35:47.312,It was enough to fill a life.
00:35:56.404,00:35:59.741,-It was delicious. -I have to learn how to cook.
00:35:59.908,00:36:02.327,"Yeah, I was thinking of saying something in chapel."
00:36:02.410,00:36:04.537,Perhaps some of the womenfolk will volunteer.
00:36:04.621,00:36:07.290,I can't have people coming here and cooking for me.
00:36:09.709,00:36:18.009,"I so… I so regret, I should have raised you less like a companion, and more like a young woman."
00:36:19.219,00:36:22.639,"I'm sorry, Ada, and for dragging you here."
00:36:23.431,00:36:24.599,I'm not sorry.
00:36:28.645,00:36:30.730,I would have followed you anywhere.
00:36:37.737,00:36:43.159,"But with no one left to work this place, nothing to buy, nothing left to buy it with."
00:36:44.577,00:36:47.038,I just don't know how we're gonna get through another winter.
00:36:51.292,00:36:52.627,Will you play me somethin'?
00:36:53.461,00:36:55.880,Somethin' peaceful while I look over my sermon.
00:36:57.090,00:36:59.426,It's too damp out here. You should come inside.
00:36:59.592,00:37:01.886,No. I like it.
00:37:18.069,00:37:20.155,"Daddy, bring the tablecloth in."
00:37:23.616,00:37:25.744,Come inside before you drown.
00:38:16.294,00:38:17.420,North Carolina.
00:38:19.839,00:38:21.132,It's come a long way.
00:38:25.261,00:38:29.015,It's not too recent. It's written this past winter.
00:38:32.811,00:38:34.771,I'm afraid I can't read who it's from.
00:38:39.734,00:38:46.699,Dear Mr. Inman… time has been measured out in bitter chapters.
00:38:58.962,00:39:02.257,every house in these mountains touched by tragedy.
00:39:05.468,00:39:14.102,"Each day, the dread of learning who has fallen who will not return from this terrible war..."
00:39:16.604,00:39:18.106,and no word from you.
00:39:19.566,00:39:20.817,Are you alive?
00:39:21.860,00:39:23.486,I pray to God you are.
00:39:25.655,00:39:31.619,"This war is lost on the battlefield, and it's being lost twice over by those who stayed behind."
00:39:32.954,00:39:34.706,"He ain't comin' back, you know that."
00:39:40.837,00:39:42.547,You must know that in your heart.
00:39:45.842,00:39:46.843,Look at me.
00:39:56.769,00:39:58.021,I'm not nothin'.
00:40:04.402,00:40:17.707,"as I promised I would… but I find myself alone, and at the end of my wits… Too embarrassed to keep taking from those who can least afford to give."
00:40:35.016,00:40:39.187,"Poor soul, she's got nobody, and nothin' and waitin' on a ghost."
00:41:06.214,00:41:07.131,Come on.
00:41:13.680,00:41:26.651,"So, now I say to you, plain as I can… if you are fighting, stop fighting, if you are marching, stop marching."
00:41:29.404,00:41:30.655,Come back to me.
00:41:35.535,00:41:37.662,Come back to me is my request.
00:41:49.966,00:41:53.386,Come back to me is my request.
00:42:11.404,00:42:13.406,Hey! Your hot goobers here.
00:42:18.745,00:42:20.121,"Gettin' better, soldier?"
00:42:21.831,00:42:22.874,Seems that way.
00:42:26.335,00:42:27.962,The war's almost done.
00:42:34.093,00:42:36.763,Ten minutes to get your haircuts and shaves.
00:42:36.929,00:42:39.807,Been meanin' to ask you. Where'd you take your wound?
00:42:42.351,00:42:44.604,Never set eyes on a thing in this world.
00:42:44.896,00:42:48.357,"Not a tree, a gun or a woman."
00:42:52.445,00:42:53.654,What would you give for that?
00:42:54.072,00:42:56.824,-Huh? -To have your eyeballs for ten minutes.
00:42:57.116,00:42:58.618,Ten minutes?
00:42:59.410,00:43:01.704,I wouldn't give a Indian head cent.
00:43:02.413,00:43:03.664,Might turn me hateful.
00:43:04.373,00:43:07.960,"-That's sure what seein's done to me. -No, that's not the way I meant it."
00:43:09.212,00:43:10.463,You said ten minutes.
00:43:11.798,00:43:15.384,"It's havin' a thing, and then the loss of it I'm talking about."
00:43:16.344,00:43:17.470,Then we don't agree.
00:43:19.388,00:43:21.849,There's not much I wouldn't give for ten minutes of someplace.
00:43:24.644,00:43:26.020,or someone.
00:43:29.148,00:43:30.399,You watch yourself now.
00:43:32.318,00:43:34.737,They're shootin' men who take themselves a walk.
00:44:17.321,00:44:34.589,"Governor of this great state of North Carolina, Any soldier turned deserter is guilty of treason Any man takes in a deserter is likewise guilty of treason."
00:44:35.882,00:44:42.346,"The home guard is powered to enter any place it sees fit, without notice or constraint."
00:44:43.264,00:44:45.641,Captain Teague needs more volunteers.
00:44:46.184,00:44:54.442,"Any man whose age, or infirmity prevents him from fightin' can join us to protect this county from Yankee raiders, and traitors to the cause."
00:44:55.109,00:44:56.861,-Is there a letter for me? -Nothin'.
00:44:56.944,00:44:58.613,We've been gettin' no post through at all.
00:44:59.947,00:45:01.657,"The sooner we lose this war, the better."
00:45:01.908,00:45:05.161,They say not one boy in ten is comin' home to these mountains.
00:45:05.536,00:45:07.747,Teague and his rabble throwin' their weight around.
00:45:07.830,00:45:09.332,They're worse than the Yankees.
00:45:10.458,00:45:12.001,"Might I speak with you, please?"
00:45:15.046,00:45:16.797,This was the reverend Monroe's.
00:45:20.259,00:45:22.053,I don't know who would want a watch.
00:45:25.014,00:45:26.724,Who can bear to look at the time?
00:45:30.686,00:45:32.772,I've got a little salt pork you can have.
00:45:35.233,00:45:36.734,Keep your daddy's watch.
00:45:39.487,00:45:40.488,Thank you.
00:45:43.783,00:45:47.703,I was talkin' to some of the other womenfolk about maybe lookin' in on you at Black Cove.
00:45:47.787,00:45:51.916,"-It's hard right now-- -No, I manage very well, whatever the talk is."
00:45:54.669,00:45:56.587,I'm very grateful for the pork.
00:45:59.674,00:46:01.676,"Which I intend to pay for, of course."
00:46:13.521,00:46:14.522,Mm-hmm.
00:46:32.707,00:46:33.749,Ada.
00:46:36.294,00:46:39.588,"Why, Ada, you are skinny as a whippet, girl."
00:46:39.922,00:46:50.683,"-You are comin' indoors with me. -No, I can't. I don't, um… -I can't keep countin' on your kindness. -Now, come on. I'm makin' a stew."
00:46:51.017,00:46:52.435,We'd be proud to have you.
00:46:54.145,00:46:55.813,Esco's gonna be wantin' his dinner.
00:47:00.860,00:47:09.118,"Sit on the porch with Sal, watch my boys in the fields, holler good job every hour or so."
00:47:09.410,00:47:11.579,"That'll be a good day, when our boys get home."
00:47:13.122,00:47:14.999,What about your people in Charleston?
00:47:19.128,00:47:20.254,There are no people.
00:47:21.964,00:47:23.049,And there's no money.
00:47:24.800,00:47:28.346,My father had some bonds and investments.
00:47:29.096,00:47:38.230,"They're worthless now, of course. The war… They're not worth anything. I don't have anywhere else to go."
00:47:44.695,00:47:45.821,I don't wanna go.
00:47:57.375,00:47:58.376,She should!
00:48:00.211,00:48:05.341,"If you look down our well with a mirror, you'll see the future. It's what they say."
00:48:07.259,00:48:09.720,You do it. She does it.
00:48:11.972,00:48:13.140,What kind of mirror?
00:48:14.850,00:48:16.852,"We'll hold on to you. Esco, you hold on."
00:48:22.942,00:48:24.151,See anything?
00:48:29.031,00:48:30.157,uh...
00:48:34.078,00:48:36.455,Lookin' for a sign my boys were comin' home.
00:48:37.081,00:48:38.541,I never saw a dickey bird.
00:49:10.114,00:49:11.407,or thought I did.
00:49:13.451,00:49:26.589,I found myself crouching over Sally Swanger's well… like a madwoman staring into its secrets.
00:49:28.841,00:49:33.512,"Was it you I saw walking home to me, or was it your ghost?"
00:49:34.472,00:49:45.524,"After so long, I know I must learn to survive on my own, and accept you will not return… and yet, I cannot. I cannot."
00:49:53.157,00:49:57.828,"If that letter ain't urgent, -Them cows is, is what I'm sayin'. -I don't know you."
00:50:01.999,00:50:03.000,Here I am.
00:50:04.919,00:50:09.590,"I… I need help, but I need-- I do need help, but I need a laborer."
00:50:09.924,00:50:14.553,There's… There's plowing and rough work. I think there's been a misunderstanding.
00:50:15.012,00:50:16.347,What's that rake for?
00:50:18.057,00:50:22.728,"-The rake? -Well, it ain't for gardenin', that's for sure. Number one, you got a horse?"
00:50:22.853,00:50:30.361,"I can plow all day. I'm a worker. Number two, ain't no man better'n me, 'cause there ain't no man around who ain't old or full of mischief."
00:50:32.655,00:50:33.822,I know your plight.
00:50:35.241,00:50:36.283,My plight?
00:50:36.367,00:50:39.286,Am I hard to hear? 'Cause you keep repeatin' everything.
00:50:39.870,00:50:41.038,I ain't lookin' for money.
00:50:41.121,00:50:43.374,"I never cared for it, and now it ain't worth nothin'."
00:50:43.624,00:50:46.126,"I expect to board and eat, at the same table."
00:50:46.877,00:50:50.297,"-I ain't a servant, if you get my meanin'. -You're not a servant."
00:50:50.422,00:50:53.342,People's gonna have to empty their own night jars is my point.
00:50:54.927,00:50:57.513,"And I don't expect to work whilst you sit around and watch, neither."
00:50:57.888,00:51:01.141,-Right. -Right. Is that a yes or a no?
00:51:04.520,00:51:07.731,"There's a rooster. He's the devil, I'm sure of it."
00:51:07.815,00:51:10.359,"I go near him, and he is at me with his spurs."
00:51:10.442,00:51:14.280,-He's Lucifer himself. -I despise a floggin' rooster.
00:52:39.948,00:52:41.325,my butterfly.
00:52:43.035,00:52:44.036,Come fly away.
00:52:51.001,00:52:53.128,God forgive me for doin' this.
00:52:53.921,00:52:55.255,I'm so sorry.
00:52:56.507,00:52:58.550,I'm sendin' you to a better place.
00:53:11.438,00:53:14.983,"-I killed several of them. -I mean, I'm God's minister."
00:53:15.984,00:53:19.822,What part of God's business is throwin' a woman down a gorge?
00:53:22.449,00:53:25.911,Can you see that in this light? Black as a bucket of tar.
00:53:26.078,00:53:34.378,"-Is she dead? -I drugged her, like you would a butterfly, and I care for her. That's the heartbreak of it."
00:53:35.421,00:53:37.381,She's got my bastard in her belly.
00:53:43.053,00:53:44.430,-I'm beggin' you. -Git.
00:53:49.393,00:53:51.145,than return me to this place.
00:53:52.146,00:53:53.814,You're gonna put her back where she sleeps.
00:53:56.400,00:54:02.239,"I do that, the members will lynch me for sirin' a bastard while servin' as their preacher."
00:54:04.324,00:54:07.828,We've churched men for pickin' up a fiddle on the Sabbath.
00:54:08.036,00:54:11.165,"So, you reckon to kill her? What, because she's a slave?"
00:55:10.766,00:55:12.768,"Oh, I… I just have to eat somethin'."
00:55:12.893,00:55:15.813,"Well, then, you got to get up earlier. What's that?"
00:55:17.856,00:55:18.899,A novel.
00:55:20.275,00:55:23.195,"You wanna carry a book, carry one you can write in."
00:55:25.030,00:55:31.078,We got our own story. It's called Black Cove Farm Catastrophe.
00:55:32.371,00:55:38.418,"I can spell it, too. Learned it the same place you did, in the schoolhouse. One of the first words they taught me."
00:55:39.795,00:55:44.716,"Ruby Thewes, you are a c-a-t-a-s-t-r-o-p-h-e."
00:55:45.300,00:55:51.139,Three years I was in school before my daddy-- Sayin' God rest his soul is like wishin' him what he had in life.
00:55:51.223,00:55:53.559,He lived to rest. He's born tired.
00:55:54.268,00:55:59.273,"He decided, better use for me than havin' me sat all day in front of a chalkboard."
00:56:07.865,00:56:12.494,"Number one, lay out a winter garden for cool-season crops."
00:56:13.370,00:56:20.252,"Turnips right there, onions, cabbage… collards."
00:56:20.460,00:56:23.589,"Number two, patch the shingles on the barn roof."
00:56:24.131,00:56:25.924,Have we got a maul and froe?
00:56:26.550,00:56:30.137,-Maul? -Maul. M-a-u-l.
00:56:30.429,00:56:33.557,"Number three, clear and turn this field."
00:56:40.981,00:56:44.151,No harm done lettin' it go. Now we'll do well.
00:56:44.985,00:56:48.530,"-Number 15. -Sixteen, -number 16. -Number 16."
00:56:51.116,00:56:52.743,Keep away these crows.
00:56:53.118,00:56:55.996,"One thing in abundance on this farm, and that's crows."
00:56:56.330,00:56:57.414,Shut the gate.
00:57:41.500,00:57:43.043,I'd pay a dollar for an egg.
00:57:45.462,00:57:47.047,I've got no quarrel with you.
00:57:47.923,00:57:49.007,Hey!
00:57:50.342,00:57:52.177,Am I near the Cape Fear river?
00:58:38.974,00:58:40.475,-Let's get 'em! -Come on!
00:59:10.172,00:59:12.340,I daresay that's home guard followin' you.
00:59:13.467,00:59:18.722,"They're out on the road, huntin' down deserters, and I don't recommend that way."
00:59:19.598,00:59:30.817,"You'll meet half the town comin' after me with a noose, -thanks to you. -I should have shot you -when I had the chance. -I know where there's a ferry crossin', or you can stubborn yourself to death."
00:59:33.820,00:59:36.323,Please yourself. I'm just bein' a Christian.
00:59:40.494,00:59:45.874,"For five dollars, I wouldn't give a parched man -a dipper of this river water. -Sign says, Ferry, five dollars."
00:59:46.458,00:59:50.128,Nobody cross these waters unless they're runnin' from someplace.
00:59:54.841,00:59:56.968,I can give you 30 dollars confederate.
00:59:57.052,01:00:00.555,"-Well, all right, let's go. -Whatever that's worth."
01:00:06.311,01:00:08.355,They cut off my hair.
01:00:09.773,01:00:10.982,That was hard.
01:00:12.567,01:00:14.152,I was vain about my hair.
01:00:15.278,01:00:19.533,I had curls… but I deserved it.
01:00:21.535,01:00:24.788,I'm the Reverend Veasey. Have I seen you in church?
01:00:29.584,01:00:33.463,"I'd say, these days, the devil rules the roost."
01:00:36.591,01:00:40.554,"Thirty more dollars, and we can go over to that cabin, and I can pull this dress over my head."
01:00:44.182,01:00:45.475,Have we got 30 dollars?
01:01:06.079,01:01:08.957,-What's this wood? -I don't know.
01:01:09.833,01:01:10.834,In.
01:01:11.418,01:01:12.961,-I don't know. -Pine!
01:01:16.631,01:01:17.632,North?
01:01:18.508,01:01:23.263,Uh… Name me three herbs that grow wild on this farm.
01:01:27.184,01:01:29.686,I can talk about farming in Latin.
01:01:30.437,01:01:33.440,I… I can… I can read French.
01:01:34.274,01:01:39.196,"I know how to lace up a corset, God knows. I can name the principal rivers in Europe."
01:01:39.279,01:01:42.532,Just don't ask me to name one stream in this county!
01:01:43.074,01:01:45.994,"I can… I can embroider, but I can't darn!"
01:01:46.244,01:01:49.539,"I can arrange cut flowers, but I can't grow them!"
01:01:52.584,01:01:57.756,"If a thing has a function, if I might do something with it, then it wasn't considered suitable!"
01:02:01.301,01:02:02.302,Why?
01:02:05.472,01:02:08.850,"Ruby, you can ask why about pretty much everything to do with me."
01:02:12.938,01:02:19.402,This fence is about the first thing that I've ever done that might produce an actual result.
01:02:31.164,01:02:33.583,"So, you never wrapped your legs around this Inman?"
01:02:41.007,01:02:42.008,Come on.
01:03:55.540,01:03:58.043,"If we're careful, now we'll get through winter."
01:03:59.044,01:04:06.718,"I got old man Roy to give me ten of them sheep on account of I said They so small, put together, they weren't no bigger than six proper sheep."
01:04:14.142,01:04:18.813,I cut off my hair once for money. My daddy got two dollars for it.
01:04:18.938,01:04:21.441,Made a wig for some rich feller in Raleigh.
01:04:25.278,01:04:28.365,I'm just sayin' I'm real sorry you had to lose your piano.
01:04:28.531,01:04:33.328,"-Ruby, it was my idea. -Stobrod liked to call himself a musician."
01:04:33.661,01:04:37.332,"My daddy, he could play six tunes on a fiddle."
01:04:38.249,01:04:41.544,Got hisself shot dead at Petersburg.
01:04:42.754,01:04:44.005,I was like his goat...
01:04:45.757,01:04:47.675,or some critter tethered to a post.
01:04:51.888,01:04:54.933,"He left me once, up in them mountains."
01:04:55.016,01:04:57.310,I was eight. He was gone over two and a half weeks.
01:04:57.602,01:04:58.686,He left you?
01:05:01.981,01:05:03.775,Uh-huh. I was all right.
01:05:05.693,01:05:11.032,"My daddy, he'd walk 40 miles for liquor, and not 40 inches for kindness."
01:05:24.879,01:05:31.553,"Open my gut now, they'd find turds stacked up like little, black twigs."
01:05:55.201,01:05:56.494,Look at this!
01:05:59.164,01:06:01.708,-It's a good saw! -And it's not yours.
01:06:03.084,01:06:04.127,You're a Christian.
01:06:05.211,01:06:06.880,Don't you know your commandments?
01:06:07.964,01:06:11.426,You'll find the good Lord very flexible on the subject of property.
01:06:14.095,01:06:15.680,We could do a lot with this saw.
01:06:19.517,01:06:20.810,Play music with it.
01:06:22.479,01:06:24.314,You're gonna thank me for this saw.
01:06:26.900,01:06:28.485,and I've found some food.
01:06:49.047,01:06:50.298,Good day to you.
01:06:57.931,01:07:05.688,"My old bull wandered off, and died in this here creek. Poisonin' up our water is how I found him."
01:07:10.235,01:07:12.237,"Thank you, you are a true Christian."
01:07:14.405,01:07:16.699,That's a rank odor from that animal.
01:07:24.916,01:07:28.419,"You fellers help me out, my woman'll cook you up a good dinner."
01:07:28.795,01:07:30.296,I… I'm gettin' an idea.
01:07:32.757,01:07:34.008,My saw's the remedy.
01:07:34.968,01:07:37.095,I believe you need two people for this.
01:07:37.178,01:07:39.097,-One on either end. -Yeah.
01:07:40.181,01:07:41.266,Give me that saw.
01:07:48.231,01:07:49.482,Let's do this in chapters.
01:07:49.607,01:07:50.858,-That's right. -Yeah.
01:07:51.276,01:07:52.694,Start at the neck.
01:07:59.200,01:08:01.995,"Oh, well, that is unpleasant."
01:08:05.999,01:08:09.252,Hope you can stomach a yard chock full of female.
01:08:09.961,01:08:12.005,"Oh, God. Oh, my God."
01:08:12.589,01:08:18.803,Hallelujah. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! The Israelites!
01:08:19.637,01:08:23.141,-What happened? -He's got a shit coming. It's overdue.
01:08:23.391,01:08:29.314,The tribes of Israel are about to flee from the banks of Egypt!
01:08:30.148,01:08:31.149,Good God.
01:08:40.908,01:08:51.919,"Brought my woman home, she showed up with her three sisters, so-called, and their brats. That's Mae, Dolly, Shyla, and the pretty one in blue is my wife Lila."
01:09:13.524,01:09:15.234,"Oh, I'm about to pass out."
01:09:22.158,01:09:24.619,"Oh… oh, look, he's gone now."
01:09:29.999,01:09:32.126,-His eyes are gone. -What?
01:09:40.385,01:09:43.930,I'm… I'm leavin' soon as I'm full. Y'all are havin' too much fun for me.
01:09:46.349,01:09:54.857,"Well, yeah, I… I got a bunch of traps need visitin', but… but I'll be back before… uh, before dark tomorrow. Y'all still be here?"
01:09:55.274,01:09:58.820,-That's my fervent prayer. -I'll say my good-byes.
01:09:59.404,01:10:07.537,"I gotta go. I got miles, and miles, and miles, and miles ahead of me before I reach the Blue Ridge."
01:10:27.890,01:10:33.396,"I'm headin' for that smokehouse, and I'm ready to be washed clean of my dirt."
01:10:33.521,01:10:36.232,"-Yeah, Mae, you go tend to him. -Mm-hmm."
01:10:36.774,01:10:39.152,All right. Y'all get to bed.
01:10:40.153,01:10:42.113,Everybody else got their job.
01:10:56.669,01:11:03.009,"He's mine, you go rub yourself off on the preacher. I'm gonna make him hug me till I grunt."
01:11:07.972,01:11:08.973,Git.
01:11:21.235,01:11:26.949,"All right… I know, I know."
01:11:28.743,01:11:33.080,I… How about that?
01:11:38.628,01:11:40.254,-gotta go. -Get on!
01:11:59.106,01:12:00.107,You shy?
01:12:00.817,01:12:06.280,"-Need a hand? -No. I… Let's have a look, and see what we can muster."
01:12:12.328,01:12:13.329,Slut!
01:12:16.749,01:12:21.170,"Cover yourself up! I told you, you don't touch the money!"
01:12:47.989,01:12:49.031,Thanks.
01:13:06.924,01:13:09.468,You got a long walk back to the fightin'.
01:13:15.016,01:13:18.019,"Ada Monroe and Ruby Thewes, look at you both."
01:13:18.352,01:13:19.562,Look at us both what?
01:13:19.645,01:13:22.189,Like a couple of scarecrows after a thunderstorm.
01:13:22.273,01:13:23.524,We need a scarecrow.
01:13:24.150,01:13:29.530,"-Birds done ate up half our winter garden. -For all your kindness, coffee and a pie."
01:13:30.615,01:13:32.116,"Yeah, and that's real coffee."
01:13:32.283,01:13:35.953,It ain't chicory and dirt. Found a sack hid in the larder.
01:13:36.203,01:13:38.664,"Mm, thank you both."
01:13:39.457,01:13:42.835,"Ruby, I look forward to this. We all do."
01:13:43.294,01:13:46.380,-Esco and me. -She made it.
01:13:47.298,01:13:48.299,I made it.
01:13:50.301,01:13:51.761,Good God in heaven.
01:13:55.514,01:13:59.936,"Well, I know Esco's gonna be real sorry he missed you."
01:14:11.447,01:14:12.490,Yep.
01:14:17.536,01:14:20.122,-Strike you as odd? -What?
01:14:20.498,01:14:21.874,Stood at her front door.
01:14:22.833,01:14:23.834,I know.
01:14:25.044,01:14:26.879,"Number one, I knowed that woman all my life."
01:14:26.963,01:14:28.631,I never stood outside her house.
01:14:29.131,01:14:31.258,She'd let a wolf in if it knocked at the door.
01:14:32.760,01:14:36.138,Perhaps I… I don't know. Perhaps she was busy.
01:14:36.597,01:14:38.933,"Number two, old man Swanger's inside that house."
01:14:39.016,01:14:40.309,I could smell his pipe burnin'.
01:14:42.603,01:14:44.981,"Number three, look at them fields."
01:14:45.815,01:14:46.816,What about them?
01:14:47.233,01:14:51.028,"We come by here a week ago, and they was waist-high in hay."
01:14:51.529,01:14:54.824,You tellin' me that's work for one old man and his dog?
01:15:05.918,01:15:10.381,Cavalry! Federal raiders! Just over that hill.
01:15:10.506,01:15:12.466,-Get those sacks of shit up that hill. -Come on!
01:15:26.439,01:16:08.731,"Make a move, make a noise… I'm not gettin' shot again for some cause I don't believe in."
01:16:09.940,01:16:14.070,"Come on, let's go. Come on. They can't shoot. Come on."
01:16:23.579,01:16:24.830,Come on!
01:17:21.303,01:17:23.848,or are you tryin' to make a man for yourself?
01:17:24.306,01:17:25.307,No.
01:17:27.434,01:17:45.244,When I come by… I see you… -and I don't like it. -Where's your little servant girl?
01:17:46.036,01:17:49.790,Ruby. She tradin' off more of your daddy's silver?
01:17:52.168,01:17:54.044,Her nose is right in your butter!
01:18:07.474,01:18:11.103,"You listenin', woman? You're gonna need more than a scarecrow!"
01:19:39.275,01:19:40.734,Sal.
01:19:52.162,01:19:53.163,Afternoon.
01:19:56.000,01:19:58.794,Don't spread out. Why they spreadin' out?
01:19:59.628,01:20:02.047,I never seen a man work a field with a shotgun before.
01:20:02.589,01:20:05.551,There's a war on. Get off my land!
01:20:06.885,01:20:10.389,-Your boys come home? -Ain't seen my boys in four years.
01:20:10.472,01:20:13.058,"They're out fightin' other boys, not old men and women."
01:20:13.183,01:20:14.893,"So, you won't mind if we look around?"
01:20:16.353,01:20:20.316,'Cause we think they're here. We think you've got 'em hid up somewhere.
01:20:21.108,01:20:25.029,What I gotta give you? Chicken? Lamb?
01:20:26.864,01:20:27.865,Sure.
01:20:28.532,01:20:33.495,"The thing is, you've only got one barrel, and there's five of us. That's not a fair fight."
01:20:42.212,01:20:43.213,Hey!
01:20:51.847,01:20:53.974,"I could confiscate this farm, and everything on it."
01:20:54.058,01:20:57.436,"Every plate, every sheet, every little pellet of chicken shit."
01:20:57.519,01:21:01.315,"I could confiscate your old lady's asshole, so don't you offer me no bird."
01:21:37.017,01:21:40.687,-Mama! -No!
01:21:45.234,01:21:46.318,No!
01:22:27.359,01:22:32.448,"If I'd-a known you were this heavy, I'd-a left you in those chains."
01:22:50.757,01:22:51.758,Ugh!
01:22:57.139,01:22:58.265,No!
01:23:00.976,01:23:03.312,"Oh, God. Sally? Ada!"
01:23:05.022,01:23:06.356,"All right, all right!"
01:23:09.776,01:23:12.654,"-Darlin', what? -Don't bother."
01:23:12.779,01:23:15.574,She's sayin' Don't bother! Go!
01:23:43.727,01:23:45.187,How long have I been sleepin'?
01:23:45.938,01:23:48.941,"Two days, three days. Not long enough."
01:23:49.775,01:23:52.986,-I can't stop here. -Sit down before you fall down.
01:23:53.862,01:23:54.905,I'm a deserter.
01:23:56.532,01:23:59.368,"If they find me here, things could be bad for you."
01:23:59.868,01:24:02.621,"Oh, what are they gonna do? Cut short my young life?"
01:24:11.547,01:24:25.435,"I've learned a person can pretty much survive off of a goat. A goat gives you company, and milk, and cheese, and, when you need it, good meat."
01:24:29.231,01:24:33.443,"There's my beauty, there's my beauty."
01:24:34.528,01:24:35.821,So you been fightin'.
01:24:39.866,01:24:43.787,"I could be at killin', for days."
01:24:45.497,01:24:51.587,My feet against the feet of my enemy… and I always killed him.
01:24:56.216,01:24:59.344,He never killed me. I don't know why.
01:25:01.722,01:25:03.724,"Gave it a try, to look at ya."
01:25:06.393,01:25:07.603,"Yeah, I guess he did."
01:25:08.562,01:25:09.980,"See, I think there's a plan."
01:25:10.188,01:25:12.232,There's a design for each and every one of us.
01:25:12.899,01:25:19.072,"You look at nature. Bird flies somewhere, picks up a seed, shits the seed out, plant grows."
01:25:19.489,01:25:27.831,"Bird's got a job, shit's got a job, seed's got a job… and you've got a job."
01:25:29.625,01:25:30.917,"You've done good, goat."
01:25:32.961,01:25:34.713,You were a real beauty.
01:25:47.684,01:25:50.312,Sometimes I think I'm crazy when I'm just hungry.
01:25:53.607,01:25:55.734,"It eases the pain, and you'll sleep."
01:26:03.241,01:26:06.036,"Is she waitin' for ya, this Ada Monroe?"
01:26:07.412,01:26:08.455,She was.
01:26:09.623,01:26:16.880,I don't know… Lie down.
01:26:18.840,01:26:22.928,"I'm like the boy who goes for wood in winter, and comes back in spring with a whistle."
01:26:25.347,01:26:29.518,Like every fool sent off to fight with a flag and a lie.
01:26:32.604,01:26:35.732,That's the laudanum gettin' to ya. That's good.
01:26:43.990,01:26:45.242,She got me a book.
01:26:47.411,01:26:48.578,Ada Monroe.
01:26:56.128,01:26:57.629,He wrote about his travels.
01:26:59.297,01:27:13.895,"Sometimes, just readin' the name of a place… Sorell Cove."
01:27:16.481,01:27:17.816,Bishop's Creek.
01:27:19.568,01:27:22.821,Those places belonged to people before us.
01:27:24.364,01:27:25.449,To the Cherokee.
01:27:26.658,01:27:29.661,What did he call Cold Mountain?
01:27:32.956,01:27:34.791,How could a name?
01:27:51.266,01:28:07.574,She's the place I'm headin'… And I just can't seem to get back to her.
01:28:17.751,01:28:21.671,-a thousand terrible miles. -I have to close my eyes.
01:28:25.258,01:28:44.402,"his ocean, his swamps, his slopes and ridges to find myself, at last, a mark in the aching snow from whence I beheld through a blue haze a world of mountains Ada!"
01:28:46.822,01:28:47.906,Ada!
01:28:53.203,01:28:55.247,-It's a man! -What is?
01:28:55.622,01:28:59.501,Raidin' our corncrib! Got him in the trap! That's him yelpin'!
01:29:04.422,01:29:07.050,Help! Damn.
01:29:08.051,01:29:09.135,Listen up!
01:29:10.220,01:29:14.349,You got-- Aim! You got a barrel trained on your rear end!
01:29:17.644,01:29:21.898,"No, ma'am. I'm… I'm-- My fists are about to drop off."
01:29:22.816,01:29:24.985,Unbelievable.
01:29:34.828,01:29:36.037,That's my daddy.
01:29:44.296,01:29:48.800,"Number one, they hang people round here for takin' in deserters."
01:29:49.509,01:29:57.142,"Number two, even if they's givin' out prizes, -you'd still eat outside. -You're scarred."
01:30:01.813,01:30:05.859,You'd be scarred. You'd be real scarred if I hadn't wrapped them trap teeth in sackin'.
01:30:05.942,01:30:08.904,-Which was my idea. -Which was her idea.
01:30:10.405,01:30:13.325,-I hurt you. -Good God.
01:30:14.117,01:30:16.536,I made up 50 tunes with you in mind.
01:30:16.995,01:30:20.373,"Ruby this, Ruby that, Ruby with the Eyes that Sparkle."
01:30:20.457,01:30:22.292,Hey! Let's agree.
01:30:23.126,01:30:36.056,"You beat me, you abandoned me, you ignored me, then you beat me some more, and all of that is better'n -Ruby With the Eyes That Sparkle. -I'm changed. People change."
01:30:36.640,01:30:38.558,War changes people somethin' terrible.
01:30:38.808,01:30:41.811,"Ruby's told you, I've no doubt, I wasn't always the best."
01:30:41.895,01:30:46.107,"-You were an asshole! -I can't disagree with that, I was."
01:30:46.566,01:30:49.444,-Would you get him outta here? -Music's changed me.
01:30:50.612,01:30:54.074,"I'm full of music, Ruby. I wished I brung my fiddle."
01:30:54.658,01:30:58.244,"Hey, Ruby, I got a new fiddle. It's a beautiful fiddle."
01:30:58.370,01:31:00.956,"It's full of tunes, Ruby, I didn't know I had it in me."
01:31:02.749,01:31:03.750,You're all set.
01:31:04.834,01:31:14.719,I… Bless you both.
01:31:29.317,01:31:33.863,"Oh, darlin', I'm fine, you know, and you just say the word, I won't come back, neither."
01:31:34.280,01:31:36.741,"Don't wanna put you, or your mistress here in any bother."
01:31:36.866,01:31:38.451,I'm not Ruby's employer.
01:31:39.786,01:31:42.706,-Beg pardon. -Nobody is.
01:31:43.665,01:31:44.666,Oh.
01:31:53.758,01:31:57.554,"You know who really needs a coat, darlin'. Is my partner fat boy name of Pangle."
01:31:58.013,01:32:04.602,"We're hidin' up in a cave with a singer from Georgia, and Pangle, he feels the cold like a thin man, but there ain't no coat'll fit him."
01:32:09.941,01:32:10.942,"I love you, Ruby."
01:32:14.154,01:32:18.908,In case the sky falls on our head… you always were a good girl.
01:32:35.675,01:32:39.429,"We could lay him in the dirt, and grow another one just like him."
01:32:40.513,01:32:46.019,"That's medicine, that's goat meat… and you're sick of both."
01:32:47.062,01:32:48.980,I have a deal to thank you for.
01:32:50.482,01:32:51.608,That's just for show.
01:34:08.476,01:34:09.435,Git!
01:34:32.876,01:34:37.046,"Time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees."
01:34:38.339,01:34:43.678,My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath.
01:34:44.679,01:34:49.434,"A source of little visible delight, but necessary."
01:34:51.436,01:34:56.274,He's always… always in my mind.
01:34:59.194,01:35:02.280,"You can't say that about Heathcliff, and then marry Linton."
01:35:03.656,01:35:06.409,"Mm, we'll find out."
01:35:10.663,01:35:11.664,Tomorrow.
01:35:12.999,01:35:15.043,I'm not waitin' till tomorrow!
01:35:17.045,01:35:27.055,"-Ruby… -A source of… little visible delight, but necessary."
01:35:31.267,01:35:33.102,I like that.
01:36:05.009,01:36:07.887,I need shelter and food.
01:36:22.110,01:36:23.361,Fair enough.
01:36:27.657,01:36:28.741,All I got.
01:36:36.582,01:36:41.045,"-Thank you. -I'm alone here, as you can see, with my baby."
01:36:42.130,01:36:44.173,I need to believe you mean no harm.
01:36:48.344,01:36:49.345,No.
01:36:50.555,01:36:51.848,I don't want it.
01:36:52.890,01:36:55.935,"If I had my way, they'd take metal altogether out of this world."
01:37:13.619,01:37:17.332,"It's all right. You're burnin' up, little man."
01:37:35.183,01:37:36.559,Is your baby sick?
01:37:40.313,01:37:41.481,My man's dead.
01:37:41.856,01:37:44.275,"Took his wound at Gettysburg, and never saw his boy."
01:37:45.610,01:37:49.864,-I'm sorry. -It's pretty much what you'll get if you knock on any door of this war.
01:37:50.948,01:37:53.743,"Man dead, woman left."
01:37:58.164,01:38:05.838,"-It's mean food, but it's hot. -There's been no huntin' -on the road, just cress and roots. -I need to try and feed this man."
01:38:24.399,01:38:25.483,He won't feed.
01:38:27.235,01:38:30.238,"I'm Inman, by the way. That's my name."
01:38:32.156,01:38:33.157,I'm Sara.
01:38:37.161,01:38:38.287,My baby's Ethan.
01:38:40.164,01:38:41.332,Glad to know you both.
01:38:54.512,01:38:56.264,You look about his size.
01:38:57.432,01:38:59.475,He was another man straight up and down.
01:39:01.144,01:39:02.186,Thank you.
01:39:30.006,01:39:31.132,Everything fit?
01:39:33.426,01:39:35.094,These boots are good boots.
01:39:42.935,01:39:44.353,"Well, I'll say goodnight, then."
01:39:47.231,01:39:48.232,Goodnight.
01:40:21.766,01:40:25.186,-She don't speak? -Can't speak! I told you.
01:40:53.923,01:40:55.216,Will you come inside?
01:41:19.240,01:41:30.084,"Would you do somethin' for me? Do you… think you could lie here next to me and not, need to go further?"
01:42:41.739,01:42:42.740,-I'll go. -No.
01:42:42.823,01:42:44.325,"-I'll go, shall I? -No."
01:42:58.756,01:42:59.965,…I love someone.
01:43:27.493,01:43:28.703,Try and sleep.
01:44:53.954,01:44:57.208,"-Merry Christmas, Pangle. -Night, ma'am."
01:45:06.383,01:45:09.595,-We won't. -It's dangerous. Don't sleep here.
01:45:09.887,01:45:13.557,"Oh, it's bitter. They could stop one night."
01:45:13.641,01:45:16.268,"They stop one night, they're gonna wanna stop two."
01:45:16.393,01:45:18.479,I'll be all right. This coat's warm.
01:45:18.854,01:45:21.065,What about next Sunday? It'll be New Year.
01:45:21.774,01:45:28.823,-Maybe. -Gonna be a better one -This war's over in a month. -That's what he said a month ago.
01:45:29.240,01:45:33.786,"-It started off bein' over in a month. -Night, Ms. Sally. Merry Christmas."
01:45:38.582,01:45:39.875,"-Night, ma'am. -Night."
01:45:41.919,01:45:44.380,"-Yeah, that's my Ruby. -She's an original."
01:45:53.722,01:45:57.685,"Well, I know it's meant to be the ugliest state under the heavens."
01:45:58.936,01:46:00.896,Why do you care what his name is?
01:46:02.731,01:46:05.192,"Hey, what do you call that cluster of stars right there?"
01:46:08.112,01:46:17.454,"Uh, there? That's Orion, and that's Gemini, and that is Orion's big dog, Canis Major."
01:46:18.414,01:46:19.874,"Listen to her, Sal."
01:46:20.541,01:46:22.334,She's turned into a regular highland girl.
01:46:23.961,01:46:27.798,"Nah, I could always name the stars, Ruby. That was never my problem."
01:46:29.466,01:46:30.593,Mm.
01:46:32.928,01:46:38.684,"I love you, darlin', In case that big old sky falls on our heads."
01:46:52.907,01:46:55.993,Get up! Get out of here quick! The Yankees are coming!
01:46:56.368,01:46:58.037,"Yankees, they're here."
01:46:58.245,01:47:01.332,"If they find you here, the-- things'll go bad on all of us."
01:47:02.750,01:47:07.129,"-I can try and fight 'em. -No, my baby. Please, no. Just… Please, just git!"
01:47:22.102,01:47:23.479,We're lookin' for food!
01:47:31.987,01:47:33.572,There's a baby inside. Get it.
01:47:33.656,01:47:35.574,"Please, he's sick. Don't hurt him, please!"
01:47:40.412,01:47:43.499,"That's right. Take the chickens, take the chickens, they're all I got."
01:47:58.973,01:48:01.266,Those birds won't get you through the winter.
01:48:19.493,01:48:20.786,I got a hog!
01:48:22.371,01:48:25.666,I got a hog! He's hid out behind the house!
01:48:25.749,01:48:26.750,Take a look.
01:48:28.502,01:48:29.670,Please!
01:48:33.173,01:48:35.634,"Please, sir. Please."
01:48:42.224,01:48:43.934,"Please, just cover him up."
01:48:44.852,01:48:48.522,What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you?
01:48:50.941,01:48:52.860,"I ain't got nothin' else, I swear."
01:48:53.777,01:48:56.655,-That ain't necessarily so. -Yes.
01:48:57.156,01:48:59.658,"Take me inside, we'll do whatever you want."
01:48:59.867,01:49:04.621,Take my baby inside. Let's all go inside! Please!
01:49:04.705,01:49:06.832,Please! Please!
01:49:07.499,01:49:10.335,You take that hog! I'm as good as dead!
01:49:10.878,01:49:13.839,You take that hog 'cause I'm as good as dead!
01:49:50.834,01:49:53.045,"That's better. Shh, that's better. Hmm?"
01:50:10.354,01:50:12.231,Move away from the baby!
01:50:14.525,01:50:15.526,Towards me!
01:50:16.819,01:50:21.490,-Don't shoot. We just wanted food. -Take off your boots.
01:50:24.743,01:50:26.745,Take off your pants. Take off your shirt.
01:50:34.962,01:50:36.130,"Don't shoot me, please."
01:50:38.632,01:50:40.384,We're starvin'. We haven't eaten in days.
01:50:41.927,01:50:42.928,Come on.
01:50:44.054,01:50:47.850,-We're starving. We haven't eaten in days. -Come on!
01:50:51.603,01:50:54.022,Thanks. Thank you.
01:50:54.481,01:50:56.441,-Now you get runnin'. -I will.
01:50:56.692,01:50:57.985,-And keep runnin'. -Thank you.
01:51:59.504,01:52:03.550,-I love the snow. -I hate the snow. I hate the cold.
01:52:05.886,01:52:08.222,"-Come on! -Fellas, what's the rush?"
01:52:58.021,01:53:03.193,as I always do… as I've always done.
01:53:31.513,01:53:33.515,"you cook somethin' long enough, you can eat anything."
01:53:33.849,01:53:36.518,It's froze. How long it been there for?
01:53:40.647,01:53:41.898,Not very long.
01:54:19.019,01:54:22.439,Good evenin'. Hope we didn't disturb you.
01:54:23.815,01:54:26.777,D'you mind if I warm myself by your fire?
01:54:41.458,01:54:43.210,"He picks a banjo, I got a fiddle."
01:54:43.543,01:54:45.629,Your sweetheart's got a nice piece of flesh on him.
01:54:46.671,01:54:48.757,"He looks pretty romantic by the fire, don't he?"
01:54:56.681,01:54:59.601,-You gonna play that fiddle? -Sure.
01:55:00.894,01:55:01.895,Sure.
01:55:02.979,01:55:04.022,"Hey, wake up."
01:55:06.441,01:55:07.609,"Evenin', missus."
01:55:09.319,01:55:12.030,-Where's Georgia? -Where's Georgia?
01:55:16.451,01:55:19.329,-Captain Teague wants us to play now. -Love to.
01:55:19.496,01:55:23.417,We heard there were some deserters up in these parts hidden out in a big cave.
01:55:23.708,01:55:26.461,-Not come to my ears. -So you don't know where this big cave is?
01:55:26.586,01:55:32.968,"-No, sir. -You do, Stobs. He means the-- No, right. No, no. There is a cave right up near Bearpen branch."
01:55:33.051,01:55:35.804,We played some music up there. Never occurred to me they were outliers.
01:55:35.887,01:55:40.183,It ain't nowhere near Bearpen branch. He's always gettin' lost.
01:55:40.559,01:55:42.561,That… that cave we live there.
01:55:43.562,01:55:47.649,I used to freeze up in that cave till I got gived this new coat.
01:55:48.358,01:55:49.568,Ruby made me this coat.
01:55:50.694,01:55:51.778,I like my coat.
01:55:52.154,01:55:55.490,"This part belonged to a reverend, and this part belonged to a horse."
01:55:55.782,01:56:00.495,"Ruby said what is it I should pray or neigh, dependin'."
01:56:00.704,01:56:02.581,He don't… he don't know what he's sayin'.
01:56:03.206,01:56:05.459,He got a mind no bigger than a pickled walnut.
01:57:46.142,01:57:47.769,Broke my young heart.
01:57:57.279,01:57:58.363,Stand over there.
01:58:10.375,01:58:12.711,"Ruby, she don't know one end of the war from the other."
01:58:13.962,01:58:20.594,"You don't have to worry yourself about her, is what I'm sayin'… You know what I'm sayin'?"
01:58:21.261,01:58:23.471,"You, too. You stand over there."
01:58:27.309,01:58:29.102,We gonna get our tintype made?
01:58:36.151,01:58:37.193,Don't smile.
01:58:37.736,01:58:39.613,-What? -Quit smilin'.
01:58:39.696,01:58:41.948,He always smiles. He don't mean nothin' by it.
01:58:42.032,01:58:44.743,I told him there ain't nothin' in this world worth a smile!
01:58:44.826,01:58:46.244,Put your hat over your face.
01:59:15.982,01:59:17.734,"They shot your daddy and Pangle, too!"
01:59:23.865,01:59:27.911,I told Georgia he can stop here. I told him he can sleep in the barn.
01:59:28.078,01:59:29.371,He's got nothin' inside him.
01:59:29.454,01:59:31.581,"He'll walk out of here, and die in the snow."
01:59:32.040,01:59:35.085,He can milk the cows. I was worried about that.
01:59:37.629,01:59:41.049,It's five hours' climb from here. He drew a map.
01:59:41.716,01:59:42.717,I'm ready.
01:59:44.594,01:59:47.138,You know them fools stayed the night in the mill?
01:59:48.640,01:59:50.058,That's Stobrod Thewes.
01:59:50.141,01:59:52.727,Can't do one good thing without addin' the bad.
01:59:52.936,01:59:56.523,Left tracks in the snow all the way up for the Home Guard to follow.
01:59:57.357,02:00:03.947,-Sign that says Shoot me. -Ruby… Ruby.
02:00:10.870,02:00:13.123,Every piece of this is man's bullshit.
02:00:13.665,02:00:21.423,"They call this war a cloud over the land, but they made the weather, and then they stand in the rain and say, Shit, it's rainin'!"
02:00:27.178,02:00:32.183,"If I cry one tear for my daddy, I stole it off a crocodile."
02:00:35.895,02:00:36.938,"All right, then."
02:01:26.529,02:01:28.281,"All right, then."
02:01:36.998,02:01:38.124,"Oh, dear God."
02:01:47.842,02:01:50.804,Ah! Teague's probably took him.
02:01:51.721,02:01:54.349,"They did that with the Swanger boys, didn't they?"
02:01:56.017,02:01:58.394,"Strung 'em up, as a warnin'."
02:02:04.192,02:02:08.112,They took his coat. Why would they take his coat?
02:02:14.160,02:02:18.414,Daddy? Daddy! Daddy!
02:02:24.879,02:02:28.842,Daddy? He's still breathin'!
02:02:29.300,02:02:33.680,It's Ruby! Don't you die on me again!
02:02:44.065,02:02:46.109,He's got hardly no blood left in him.
02:02:58.830,02:03:00.790,"It's got shelter, water."
02:03:01.249,02:03:03.835,I used to hide up there when he'd get a temper goin'.
02:03:43.458,02:03:44.542,God damn.
02:03:55.803,02:03:56.846,Turn around!
02:03:59.307,02:04:01.225,Go back where you came from!
02:04:03.478,02:04:04.479,Go back!
02:04:09.400,02:04:10.401,Ada?
02:04:12.028,02:04:13.154,Ada Monroe?
02:04:39.222,02:04:40.515,"Oh, my..."
02:04:46.688,02:04:49.148,Inman? Inman?
02:05:03.413,02:05:04.872,Inman.
02:05:37.947,02:05:39.198,You better come with me.
02:05:52.503,02:05:53.504,Ruby.
02:05:55.465,02:05:56.799,This is Inman.
02:06:02.221,02:06:03.973,Oh! Congratulations!
02:06:10.104,02:06:14.275,-Looks if he's about to topple over. -I may need to.
02:06:14.859,02:06:15.902,You shot or somethin'?
02:06:17.945,02:06:18.946,Not lately.
02:06:30.875,02:06:31.876,He's asleep.
02:06:32.376,02:06:35.254,I ain't surprised. Your man looked tuckered out.
02:06:35.505,02:06:36.589,I saw him.
02:06:38.341,02:06:42.762,In Sally Swanger's well. A man like a black smudge in the snow.
02:06:42.845,02:06:45.848,"-Well, there you go. -It wasn't the same, what I saw."
02:06:46.307,02:06:47.934,"In the well, it was as if he were falling."
02:06:48.017,02:06:50.269,You probably just don't remember it right.
02:06:50.353,02:06:54.023,"I remember it exactly. There were crows, black crows."
02:06:54.482,02:06:56.150,They were flyin' towards me.
02:06:56.984,02:06:59.445,"Ruby, I thought I was seein' him fall."
02:07:02.240,02:07:04.617,"Instead, I was seein' him come back to me."
02:07:07.745,02:07:10.331,I got big plans for that farm.
02:07:15.086,02:07:16.129,I know.
02:07:17.964,02:07:19.215,I know you have.
02:07:19.841,02:07:23.344,I got a vision in my mind of how Black Cove oughta be.
02:07:27.765,02:07:29.142,"I… I don't know, Ruby."
02:07:30.226,02:07:33.354,"All this while, I've been packin' ice around my heart."
02:07:37.150,02:07:38.609,How do I make it melt?
02:07:45.324,02:07:46.951,You about done with my knife?
02:07:48.286,02:07:49.704,We got a bird to cook.
02:07:51.205,02:07:52.206,Just about.
02:07:55.793,02:07:59.005,You're makin' a pig's ear of that job.
02:08:01.048,02:08:02.049,Give it to me.
02:08:13.519,02:08:16.439,Can't see that it'd make a bit of difference if I did.
02:08:28.492,02:08:32.955,You got the right feelings for her? Don't turn your head!
02:08:37.835,02:08:38.878,I do.
02:09:04.904,02:09:07.657,I'm sorry. I was tryin' to be quiet.
02:09:13.913,02:09:15.164,Did you get my letters?
02:09:18.042,02:09:19.168,I got three letters.
02:09:20.920,02:09:24.257,I carried them. I carried them in the book you gave me.
02:09:25.800,02:09:26.801,The Bartram.
02:09:28.386,02:09:30.638,I probably sent a hundred and three.
02:09:35.434,02:09:37.812,Hm. Did you write to me?
02:09:39.230,02:09:40.231,Whenever I could.
02:09:41.232,02:09:43.109,"If you… if you never got 'em, I can summarize."
02:09:46.487,02:09:48.155,I pray I am in your thoughts.
02:09:49.156,02:09:54.036,You are all that keeps me from slidin' into some dark place.
02:09:54.370,02:09:55.997,How did I keep you?
02:09:57.290,02:10:00.209,We barely knew each other. It was a few moments.
02:10:00.376,02:10:01.877,A thousand moments.
02:10:04.922,02:10:08.009,They're like a bag of tiny diamonds.
02:10:10.052,02:10:12.555,Don't matter if they're real or things I made up.
02:10:16.017,02:10:17.226,The shape of your neck.
02:10:20.062,02:10:21.105,That's real.
02:10:22.690,02:10:25.526,The way you felt under my hands when I pulled you to me.
02:10:38.039,02:10:39.623,You were plowing a field.
02:10:41.500,02:10:43.002,You were carrying a tray.
02:10:44.295,02:10:47.006,"-You wouldn't come in. -No, I wouldn't go in."
02:10:47.173,02:10:48.966,"So, that's why I had to carry a tray."
02:10:50.259,02:10:51.927,So I could come out to see you.
02:10:54.055,02:10:55.056,That kiss.
02:10:57.475,02:10:59.435,Which I kissed every day of my walking.
02:11:02.688,02:11:06.233,"Every day, I was waiting-- Longing."
02:11:16.452,02:11:24.835,"If you could see my inside, or whatever you wanna name it. My spirit? That's what I fear."
02:11:25.795,02:11:30.508,I think I'm ruined. They kept tryin' to put me in the ground.
02:11:35.137,02:11:39.016,"But if I had… if I had goodness, I lost it."
02:11:41.018,02:11:44.021,"If I had anything tender in me, I shot it dead."
02:11:46.065,02:11:51.821,How could I write to you after what I done… What I seen?
02:11:51.904,02:11:55.658,"Number one, shut this door. It's freezin'."
02:11:55.908,02:11:58.369,"Number two, shut that door. It's freezin'."
02:11:59.036,02:12:06.210,"Layin' on my back, my fingers poked in my ears, tryin' to shut out who's got a bag of diamonds, who's carrying a tray."
02:12:06.669,02:12:11.757,"If you wanna get three feet up a bull's ass, just listen to what sweethearts whisper to one another."
02:12:12.633,02:12:16.929,"In fact, if y'all gonna wimble-wimble all night, I'm gonna sleep in with him."
02:12:33.446,02:12:34.905,-I'll say good night. -No.
02:12:39.410,02:12:43.622,Please… don't say good night.
02:13:09.023,02:13:11.192,Wars make some things pointless.
02:13:15.779,02:13:17.490,It's hard to imagine a wedding.
02:13:20.534,02:13:23.287,I think even my father would recognize that.
02:13:24.538,02:13:26.040,"Ada, I wanna marry you."
02:13:28.459,02:13:29.502,If you'll have me.
02:13:31.378,02:13:38.302,"Isn't there some religion where you just have to say I marry you three times, and you're man and wife?"
02:13:39.345,02:13:40.471,I marry you.
02:13:42.515,02:13:44.600,"I marry you, I marry you."
02:13:49.730,02:13:59.698,"-Why is that funny? -I think it's I divorce you three times, I can wait for you."
02:14:00.699,02:14:08.040,"Oh, Inman. I marry you, I marry you, I marry you, I marry you, I marry you."
02:14:16.215,02:14:20.135,I have so… I have so many buttons. Sorry.
02:14:23.430,02:14:24.765,Will you turn your back?
02:14:37.486,02:14:38.487,No.
02:14:41.073,02:14:42.157,"No, I will not."
02:16:28.430,02:16:30.891,I'll lead the horse at a pace your daddy can tolerate.
02:16:31.475,02:16:34.353,"-You two go ahead now. -No, I don't wanna do that."
02:16:35.312,02:16:38.732,"-No, we can all go together. -It's safer this way. We're deserters."
02:16:40.651,02:16:42.027,He's right.
02:16:42.611,02:16:49.326,"I gather I… I need permission from you, Ruby, if I reckon on livin' at Black Cove."
02:17:04.925,02:17:10.139,"You stay on that horse, and don't lose it, or sell it."
02:17:10.764,02:17:13.225,Gonna need it back on the farm.
02:17:22.943,02:17:24.486,I don't wanna let you go.
02:17:28.365,02:17:29.950,I'll be with you by nightfall.
02:17:39.752,02:17:40.919,"All right, then."
02:18:12.618,02:18:15.704,Hope that Georgia boy's been tendin' to the animals.
02:18:16.538,02:18:19.583,-I knew you were thinkin' on him. -I… I was not!
02:18:19.666,02:18:21.919,-I was thinkin' on swollen udders. -Oh.
02:18:22.044,02:18:25.881,-And before you say same difference-- -I'm sayin' nothin'.
02:18:28.425,02:18:30.886,-Miss lovey-dovey! -Stop!
02:18:30.969,02:18:32.471,-Hey! -Ha!
02:18:40.729,02:18:50.781,"Now, your friend Georgia here… We went down to visit you when we heard you were harborin' deserters, and he told us after some persuasion you were up here."
02:18:53.784,02:18:55.077,Up and down.
02:18:55.452,02:18:57.162,There will be a reckoning.
02:18:57.830,02:19:00.791,"When this war is over, there will be a reckoning."
02:19:02.167,02:19:03.669,Did you make this coat?
02:19:04.586,02:19:06.547,"Helpin' a deserter, that's treason."
02:19:06.964,02:19:10.175,"Now, I know it's half horse, and half reverend."
02:19:12.970,02:19:13.971,A reckonin'?
02:19:26.400,02:19:29.278,I'll be damned. He's a hard bastard to kill.
02:19:29.528,02:19:30.821,Ha!
02:19:41.123,02:19:42.708,Inman!
02:20:44.895,02:20:46.772,I'll just shoot the horse out from under you.
02:20:50.692,02:20:53.111,-He dead? -I hope so.
02:20:53.862,02:20:58.367,"Look, give me your gun, and ride on home. I'm done fightin'. I'm sick of it!"
02:20:58.617,02:21:00.953,"I give you my gun, you're gonna shoot me dead."
02:21:01.036,02:21:07.501,"I will not shoot you, but nor am I goin' down this mountain -lookin' over my shoulder for you. -That's what they call a conundrum."
02:21:12.673,02:21:16.259,-I'll tell you what I got on my side. -What you got on your side?
02:21:23.850,02:21:25.102,The confidence of youth.
02:21:40.575,02:21:42.285,Inman!
02:23:12.000,02:23:16.046,I came back.
02:23:25.680,02:23:26.681,I love you.
02:24:01.133,02:24:02.300,Baby.
02:24:33.874,02:24:35.375,The land will not heal.
02:24:37.335,02:24:38.336,Too much blood.
02:24:40.172,02:24:41.673,The heart will not heal.
02:24:43.884,02:24:49.181,"All we can do is make peace with the past, and try to learn from it."
02:24:53.310,02:24:54.686,What are you doing?
02:24:56.021,02:24:59.649,"-He died in the night, love. -Bring him here."
02:25:00.942,02:25:03.236,-Don't kill him. -I'm not gonna kill him.
02:25:04.237,02:25:06.781,"We have to try somethin', or else he's gonna die, too."
02:25:42.234,02:25:46.363,When the needs of the farm call with more urgency than my heart.
02:25:54.621,02:25:56.331,I find you in all of it.
02:25:58.667,02:26:01.002,As if you were still walking home to me.
02:26:04.756,02:26:11.638,"If you could see us now, this Easter day at Black Cove, you would know every step of your journey was worth it."
02:26:29.781,02:26:32.826,"Grace Inman, nobody said eat."
02:26:46.006,02:26:53.555,"For good friends, good food, good family, all our blessings, O Lord, we thank thee."
02:26:53.930,02:26:55.223,-Amen. -Amen.
02:26:55.307,02:26:56.891,-Amen. -Amen.
02:26:59.894,02:27:02.772,"-Sweetheart, there's no cider. -You eat that, that's for you."
02:27:03.565,02:27:06.943,Right. I'd best… I'd best fetch it. I got my orders.
02:27:14.951,02:27:17.829,and this time there was nothin' there to haunt me.
02:27:19.914,02:27:21.207,Just clouds.
02:27:21.750,02:27:26.129,Clouds and then sun.
