00:03:56.986,00:03:59.197,"I know, but you talk like I'm not standing here."
00:03:59.280,00:04:00.907,LIke I'm a different person.
00:04:58.464,00:05:01.718,"But on the other hand, it might be nice to have been..."
00:05:02.593,00:05:03.594,remembered.
00:05:05.847,00:05:07.181,"Yeah, but I didn't know him."
00:05:07.807,00:05:10.184,I was practically like all other people.
00:08:59.497,00:09:00.998,What the hell am I doing here?
00:09:01.082,00:09:02.833,Nobody knows. Action!
00:14:09.515,00:14:11.183,"Jim, it's been a pleasure..."
00:16:09.677,00:16:13.013,I have some roses for all the beautiful girls in the world.
00:16:47.589,00:16:50.843,I heard Milos had to force him to go into makeup and hair.
00:16:50.926,00:16:53.178,He was passed out on the couch.
00:17:24.585,00:17:26.712,Do not mention Andy Kaufman to me.
00:17:26.795,00:17:29.798,I am not an Andy Kaufman fan. I do not like Andy Kaufman.
00:18:13.092,00:18:16.386,"As a director, Jim Carrey's nowhere in sight."
00:18:16.929,00:18:18.847,You're dealing with Tony Clifton.
00:18:18.931,00:18:20.140,Is that frustrating?
00:18:22.476,00:18:24.561,I need a director with backbone.
00:19:02.891,00:19:03.725,Sound check.
00:19:05.352,00:19:06.895,"It's called a sound check, Tony."
00:19:19.324,00:19:21.160,We're gonna have to deal with him.
00:19:24.746,00:19:26.748,He mellows after lunch.
00:19:41.346,00:19:42.848,No filming.
00:19:43.640,00:19:45.434,You can't do filming around here.
00:19:58.405,00:20:00.365,I would like to see the real shark.
00:20:00.449,00:20:02.117,This shark is a phony shark.
00:20:08.081,00:20:09.082,I do creatures.
00:20:10.000,00:20:11.460,"-Yes, I do. -What do you do?"
00:20:11.543,00:20:12.586,I do a yak.
00:20:27.976,00:20:28.977,No filming.
00:22:16.752,00:22:17.836,You take care of him.
00:22:18.462,00:22:19.504,He's pushing.
00:22:21.089,00:22:23.342,He's gonna ruin my reputation as an actor.
00:22:30.849,00:22:32.517,The eyes got a little buggy.
00:22:32.601,00:22:34.019,-They were buggy. -Yeah.
00:22:35.187,00:22:36.605,He wants to be liked.
00:22:39.232,00:22:41.985,He wants to be liked by everybody. He's his worst enemy.
00:23:14.309,00:23:17.562,Tell Jim we are doing Friday dinner.
00:24:43.690,00:24:45.233,I'm Batman.
00:25:16.473,00:25:22.854,"Standing over there, when I first came in, I really had this feeling that someone else might be walking in also."
00:25:25.899,00:25:28.193,How does it feel to be around your brother again?
00:26:02.852,00:26:04.479,"Good to see you too, Daddy."
00:26:09.651,00:26:10.986,I'm very proud of you.
00:28:02.263,00:28:03.807,That reminds me of my dad.
00:29:24.554,00:29:26.598,You have to give me a chance to make a movie.
00:30:37.752,00:30:40.171,"In this movie, you have to..."
00:30:40.255,00:30:42.966,At the end... you have to be friends with him.
00:30:47.762,00:30:49.722,"You know, that's what really happened."
00:33:28.589,00:33:32.593,"And I think that Andy had trouble early on, which is very hard."
00:33:33.094,00:33:35.722,Jim had trouble later on...
00:33:38.683,00:33:47.442,"and it kind of threw him for a loop, and he got angry, and he used that to express himself."
00:33:48.901,00:33:52.238,"In many ways, there was a lot of anger in everything he did."
00:33:52.321,00:33:53.156,But...
00:33:54.657,00:34:00.663,"he's afraid that if he gets healthy, he won't have creativity, sometimes."
00:34:00.747,00:34:01.831,-Jim? -Yep.
00:34:01.914,00:34:08.087,And I think sometimes he makes a conscious decision not to be completely together.
00:36:28.519,00:36:29.520,Quick impression.
00:36:30.479,00:36:31.856,Jackie Kennedy.
00:39:13.601,00:39:15.227,"Courtney comes today, you know."
00:41:39.997,00:41:41.373,Please do Foreign Man.
00:41:50.132,00:41:52.801,Do Latka!
00:45:36.859,00:45:38.235,You guys don't smoke.
00:45:38.527,00:45:40.404,What the hell are you doing smoking?
00:46:13.771,00:46:15.314,No... go away!
00:46:18.400,00:46:20.652,We don't want Tony to come back.
00:46:55.312,00:46:58.106,"Should we try walking him first, or should we just carry him?"
00:47:31.056,00:47:32.975,Does he ever get out of bed as Tony?
00:47:34.768,00:47:37.813,"Whose trailer is that, by the way, that we're paying for every day?"
00:47:38.939,00:47:41.733,He's not been to work though. Jim never comes to work.
00:47:48.657,00:47:51.118,"Jim can act like me all he wants, he never will be me."
00:47:51.201,00:47:52.995,No matter how much he tries.
00:49:05.192,00:49:08.403,"Hey, Tony, what do you think about that comedian Jim Carrey?"
00:49:11.490,00:49:14.534,Always smiling all the time. You can tell it's not real.
00:52:43.243,00:52:45.162,Feel free to do whatever you want.
00:53:01.928,00:53:04.723,"You know, that's Andy Kaufman's right-hand man."
00:53:06.892,00:53:09.728,"You ever see all the wrestling stuff, he's always the ref."
00:53:10.562,00:53:13.857,"There were two Tony Cliftons, there was Andy Kaufman and Bob Zmuda."
00:53:40.467,00:53:41.801,Is this Andy or you?
00:53:42.552,00:53:44.638,-That's Andy. -No! That's Bob.
00:53:44.721,00:53:46.681,"-This is a test. -Okay, that's Bob."
00:53:47.098,00:53:48.934,Is it Bob? Is it?
00:54:10.247,00:54:12.165,"Jesus, what a fucking nut."
00:54:59.879,00:55:01.423,"Who are you with, Mr. Clifton?"
00:55:54.434,00:55:55.977,That cannot be Jim Carrey.
00:55:56.686,00:55:59.189,"If that is him, he is fucking amazing."
00:55:59.272,00:56:00.857,I hate him now!
00:56:24.381,00:56:28.385,He says somebody called the freaking office. Somebody called his office.
00:56:31.054,00:56:33.056,"Get that fucking camera off, too."
00:56:37.977,00:56:39.437,"Mr. Clifton, you need to leave."
00:56:42.565,00:56:44.901,"We're gonna need the tape from your camera, please."
00:56:46.403,00:56:47.404,We need the tape.
00:56:48.279,00:56:49.155,No choice.
00:56:49.239,00:56:50.615,This is per Mr. Hefner.
00:58:01.769,00:58:02.812,What we need.
00:58:54.781,00:58:55.698,Is that my dad?
00:58:56.783,00:58:58.368,"It is! Oh, jeez."
00:58:58.826,00:58:59.911,Holy moly.
00:58:59.994,00:59:00.912,I'm tripping.
01:01:39.362,01:01:41.489,Don't start any trouble and there won't be any.
01:01:46.619,01:01:48.871,"Elvis called, he wants his shit back."
01:02:31.456,01:02:32.582,He pushed me off...
01:02:37.295,01:02:40.089,"After side suplex, he will gently put you down."
01:03:07.241,01:03:08.451,I'm not really okay.
01:04:14.809,01:04:16.435,Turn that off.
01:06:03.084,01:06:06.045,Was Carrey spitting on him off-camera? Was that like the...?
01:10:15.878,01:10:18.047,I think maybe I'll get a lawyer.
01:10:21.425,01:10:22.885,Apologize to me right now.
01:10:22.968,01:10:25.471,You're just poor white trash. So... I guess...
01:14:41.768,01:14:43.187,"I love you, man!"
01:14:51.570,01:14:54.239,"I like you a lot, but..."
01:14:55.866,01:14:57.284,I don't love you.
01:16:33.297,01:16:36.800,We can make that play. I can push him around in a wheelchair.
00:00:25.191,00:00:26.776,"-So, Jim. -Yes?"
00:00:30.530,00:00:31.364,Hmm...
00:00:35.785,00:00:39.664,"Well, if I had my choice, it wouldn't start at all."
00:00:40.457,00:00:41.958,It would already have been.
00:00:43.043,00:00:44.669,And it wouldn't end either.
00:00:45.754,00:00:49.591,You know? I guess that's probably a good way to look at it.
00:00:49.674,00:00:51.301,"You know, when did this movie start?"
00:00:59.017,00:00:59.851,"Hi, there."
00:01:08.068,00:01:12.864,in me doing the story of Andy was that I got his congas.
00:01:12.947,00:01:15.617,And there's even blood on one of them.
00:01:15.867,00:01:19.954,"Uh, and a little bit of DNA left behind by the master."
00:01:20.038,00:01:22.665,Welcome. He's the best. This guy's the best.
00:01:22.749,00:01:24.375,"You're just so positive, man."
00:01:26.753,00:01:29.547,wasn't interested in me for the part.
00:01:29.631,00:01:34.552,And it would have been a long time since I auditioned for anything.
00:01:34.636,00:01:39.682,And I kind of had to put the ego in the backseat and say I'm driving for a minute here.
00:01:39.766,00:01:43.269,"And so, I put a little audition tape together of my own."
00:01:49.609,00:01:53.571,"You don't know you can do it until you do it, so it was absolutely..."
00:01:54.030,00:01:56.074,me auditioning for myself as well.
00:02:03.832,00:02:07.919,"and altogether I went, Yeah, I can do this thing. I can do this thing."
00:02:27.480,00:02:33.611,"I was sitting in Malibu, looking at the ocean, and thinking, Where would Andy be? What would he be doing?"
00:02:33.903,00:02:38.199,Andy Kaufman cared less about making his audience laugh than keeping them confused.
00:02:38.283,00:02:39.242,Wrestle me!
00:02:43.580,00:02:46.666,trying to communicate telepathically.
00:02:51.963,00:02:53.673,That's what most people are telling me.
00:02:53.756,00:02:57.844,"Immediately, like, 30 dolphins came to the surface."
00:03:04.350,00:03:10.106,"So, I decided from then, for the next few days, to speak telepathically to people."
00:03:16.321,00:03:17.614,"But somehow, it worked."
00:03:23.203,00:03:28.208,"tapped me on the shoulder, and said, Sit down. I'll be doing my movie."
00:03:30.835,00:03:34.839,What happened afterwards was out of my control.
00:03:46.476,00:03:50.230,"You start now when Andy steps in, you know."
00:03:50.313,00:03:51.689,You mean me. I step in.
00:03:53.233,00:03:54.734,-Yeah. -Okay.
00:03:54.817,00:03:56.611,You are being Andy in this movie.
00:03:56.694,00:03:59.113,"I know, but you talk like I'm not standing here."
00:03:59.197,00:04:00.782,-No. -Like I'm a different person.
00:04:00.865,00:04:02.700,Know what you are playing though?
00:04:03.618,00:04:06.037,That is really weird. It's totally surreal.
00:04:06.120,00:04:07.413,It's really bizarre.
00:04:07.497,00:04:08.748,Thank you very much.
00:04:12.627,00:04:13.544,It's perfect.
00:04:17.882,00:04:20.343,I want to do one more.
00:04:24.097,00:04:28.434,It's really great. He's exactly the way Andy was. Exactly.
00:04:28.518,00:04:31.896,"We left the show, I said, George, this guy's the worst comic I've seen."
00:04:31.980,00:04:33.147,"He says, Isn't it great?"
00:04:33.231,00:04:35.566,"I said, No, he's the worst comic I've ever seen!"
00:04:35.650,00:04:37.277,It was really something.
00:04:37.360,00:04:40.738,"I tried to explain, He's trying to bomb. He's doing the bombing routine."
00:04:40.822,00:04:44.284,-How do you explain Kaufman before-- -If you've never seen him.
00:04:44.367,00:04:46.244,-Abuday! -Abuday!
00:04:49.247,00:04:51.958,and he sees this guy playing him that well.
00:04:53.126,00:04:53.960,Creepy.
00:04:54.752,00:04:57.505,Imagine you came back and you saw somebody playing you.
00:05:02.427,00:05:03.720,"uh, remembered."
00:05:05.847,00:05:10.059,"Yeah, but I didn't know him. I was practically like all other people."
00:05:11.394,00:05:15.356,I remember watching Andy on the Dick Van Dyke...
00:05:15.648,00:05:21.571,"uh, specials, uh, and the Carson Show doing the Foreign Man."
00:05:39.714,00:05:43.217,I wasn't even a comedian yet. I was a comedian in my house.
00:05:43.634,00:05:45.345,But... yeah.
00:05:45.428,00:05:47.221,It was before I had even started.
00:05:48.181,00:05:49.223,And it blew my mind.
00:05:49.307,00:05:50.141,Andy Kaufman!
00:05:53.519,00:05:56.022,This doesn't care what everything else is.
00:06:02.653,00:06:03.780,Whoa!
00:06:03.863,00:06:05.073,Whoa!
00:06:22.173,00:06:24.759,"Everybody was on their best behavior, had their best stuff."
00:06:24.842,00:06:28.179,"Man, Ed Sullivan, there were people spinning plates and stuff like that."
00:06:30.223,00:06:35.103,"And they had, you know, routines they had come up with and perfected over a thousand years."
00:06:35.186,00:06:38.064,And here comes Andy lip-syncing to a record.
00:06:50.535,00:06:54.622,"Reading the whole of Great Gatsby, unbelievable idea."
00:06:54.705,00:06:55.623,Chapter one.
00:06:58.084,00:07:00.211,In my younger and more vulnerable years...
00:07:03.548,00:07:05.883,"to love me, accept me."
00:07:05.967,00:07:08.636,And he even wore his father's sports jacket.
00:07:08.719,00:07:11.806,I would like to do for you some imitations.
00:07:12.390,00:07:13.224,So first...
00:07:16.602,00:07:21.816,"but he was an insurance guy, and he kind of expected the all-American kid."
00:07:21.899,00:07:30.950,"And what he got was some kind of effeminate, kooky, creative, insane person who liked to spend all his time in his room doing shows to the wall."
00:07:31.325,00:07:33.786,I thought Doodyville was inside of the television.
00:07:33.870,00:07:36.873,"Like if television was this box, and if I went inside the box..."
00:07:38.624,00:07:45.715,"child-like quality, his love for songs like Rose Marie, and Slim Whitman being his favorite singer."
00:07:55.808,00:07:58.603,I'll do anything for you except...
00:07:59.979,00:08:01.147,Except what?
00:08:06.277,00:08:07.403,Any club.
00:08:07.862,00:08:12.658,"And he was the one, while everybody else was playing sports, he was talking to the trees."
00:08:13.284,00:08:16.078,But it was about pulling those people over.
00:08:16.621,00:08:20.583,"But it was about, I've got something in my hands and it's really magical."
00:08:20.666,00:08:24.003,"But you can't see it, 'cause I have special powers."
00:08:24.086,00:08:27.632,"You know, it was that need to be special."
00:08:27.715,00:08:30.426,"Latka, no, this is a very important phone call."
00:08:34.972,00:08:37.058,-Yes. -I know what it's like to...
00:08:37.433,00:08:41.229,do shows in my room to the wall and rehearse for the company.
00:08:41.854,00:08:44.607,"And every time somebody comes over, to be putting on a show."
00:08:45.316,00:08:47.276,And the one that's a little different.
00:08:54.325,00:08:57.578,"Absolutely, it helped, but that's their version of him."
00:08:57.662,00:08:59.956,That's the way they want him to be seen.
00:09:05.461,00:09:11.842,"and then make your own assumptions, and your own calls, and your own-- go with your own instinct."
00:09:21.227,00:09:22.270,But...
00:09:22.353,00:09:23.354,who do you know?
00:09:25.898,00:09:27.817,Even when they're right in front of you.
00:09:43.624,00:09:46.294,"and had it to come to fruition, and..."
00:09:46.377,00:09:57.138,"I'm the guy who had the substitute teacher in grade two who said that, You know, whenever I want something, I pray to the Virgin Mary, I ask her for it, I promise something in return, and I get whatever I want."
00:09:57.221,00:09:59.932,So didn't you write yourself a check? I heard you did. Is that true?
00:10:00.016,00:10:07.607,"Yeah. I wrote myself a check for ten million dollars, for acting services rendered, and I gave myself five years."
00:10:07.690,00:10:10.276,"My dad could never afford a bicycle, so I went,Okay."
00:10:10.359,00:10:13.195,And I went home and I prayed for a bicycle and...
00:10:13.821,00:10:16.532,promised I'd say the rosary in return and...
00:10:16.616,00:10:18.701,then I got a bicycle.
00:10:18.784,00:10:20.620,It showed up in my living room.
00:10:20.995,00:10:22.330,A brand-new Mustang bike.
00:10:22.413,00:10:27.209,"I put it in one of the scenes in Eternal Sunshine, a Mustang bike with a banana seat."
00:10:27.627,00:10:33.049,"Just before Thanksgiving 1995, I found out that I was gonna make ten million dollars."
00:10:33.132,00:10:34.258,So you visualized...
00:10:34.342,00:10:39.096,"From then on, it was whenever I wanted something to happen, I manifested it."
00:10:39.847,00:10:44.935,"I stood there in an open field like this with my arms out going, I'm ready. Come on."
00:10:47.938,00:10:48.773,Cut.
00:10:49.732,00:10:51.150,That's enough. Perfect!
00:10:52.902,00:10:54.111,Thank you very much!
00:11:02.995,00:11:04.664,and it gets a reaction.
00:11:05.206,00:11:06.624,And it was like my dad.
00:11:06.707,00:11:10.127,"My dad was really funny, so I tried to be funny, and I was funny too."
00:11:10.211,00:11:12.088,"Holy moley, this is great."
00:11:12.463,00:11:15.383,And that's how I got...
00:11:15.966,00:11:19.595,"attention, and love, and made people think I was special."
00:11:19.679,00:11:22.223,'Cause I'm a wild and crazy guy!
00:11:23.391,00:11:25.142,Jim Carrey from Aldershot High School...
00:11:25.226,00:11:27.395,I started out imitating people.
00:11:27.478,00:11:29.021,My name is Jimmy Carter...
00:11:29.105,00:11:37.446,"And I was gonna be the man of a thousand faces, because the only person I had ever seen that had made it from Canada was Rich Little, so I thought that was the way you did it."
00:11:37.530,00:11:40.032,Lay down and pick the berries!
00:11:40.116,00:11:42.576,"Henry Fonda and, you know, people like that."
00:11:42.660,00:11:45.204,I could do anybody physically really well.
00:11:45.663,00:11:46.622,James Dean.
00:11:46.956,00:11:51.627,"And then at a certain point, I decided I would be training with weights on."
00:11:51.711,00:11:53.170,I'm not gonna have jokes.
00:11:53.254,00:11:57.174,I'm just gonna get up onstage and sweat in front of the audience until something happens.
00:11:57.258,00:12:00.594,I feel really good tonight. Really good. Excellent.
00:12:02.304,00:12:04.265,So I was just making sound.
00:12:04.348,00:12:06.600,I was just doing things that were weird.
00:12:06.684,00:12:11.772,"And then I'd go home, and I'd lay on my bed, and I'd think, What do they want? What do they want?"
00:12:11.856,00:12:13.733,"Okay, so let's practice. Okay."
00:12:13.816,00:12:15.234,It wasn't what I wanted.
00:12:15.609,00:12:16.902,I knew what I wanted.
00:12:16.986,00:12:20.823,"I wanted to be successful, I wanted to be a famous actor."
00:12:20.906,00:12:24.535,"But, What do they want? What do they want?"
00:12:24.618,00:12:33.127,"Then one day, in the middle of the night, I woke up out of a sound sleep, like sat up in bed and went, They want to be free from concern."
00:12:35.796,00:12:38.132,And the light bulb went off.
00:12:38.924,00:12:45.306,"The very next night, I went to The Comedy Store, and the first thing I did was say..."
00:12:45.389,00:12:46.348,Good evening...
00:12:46.432,00:12:50.269,"Good evening, ladies and gentleman. How are you this evening? Alrighty then."
00:12:50.352,00:12:51.437,Like that.
00:12:51.520,00:12:54.148,And it killed. Slaughtered.
00:12:54.231,00:12:57.860,"Suddenly they just roared, because they knew I didn't care."
00:12:58.903,00:13:08.454,"What I had decided, in that moment in my bed, was, They need to be free from concern, so I'm gonna be the guy that's free from concern."
00:13:09.038,00:13:12.374,I'm gonna appear to be the guy that's free from concern.
00:13:16.504,00:13:18.214,Alrighty then!
00:13:18.297,00:13:23.177,"It's as if I went into a fugue state, and Hyde showed up."
00:13:23.761,00:13:27.097,"When I put that mask on, I can do anything."
00:13:28.182,00:13:30.309,Be anything.
00:13:32.895,00:13:39.235,I have a Hyde inside me that shows up when there are people watching.
00:13:39.735,00:13:47.243,"You know. When there's a thousand people with their eyes on me, and they hand me a microphone, Jim goes away and Hyde comes out."
00:13:48.118,00:13:49.745,You know. But it's a good Hyde.
00:13:49.829,00:13:51.247,It's not a hateful Hyde.
00:13:51.622,00:13:56.544,"It's a loving Hyde that just wants everybody to party and have a good time, you know."
00:13:56.794,00:14:00.756,"Uh... but it's a Hyde nonetheless, and I feel like sometimes..."
00:14:01.340,00:14:04.718,"afterwards, like, Damn, I lost control again..."
00:14:05.886,00:14:06.762,to him.
00:14:11.976,00:14:13.644,"-Hey, you mean Andy. -Andy?"
00:14:13.727,00:14:14.812,-That's right. -Okay.
00:14:14.895,00:14:15.729,-Okay. -Okay.
00:14:15.813,00:14:18.816,"-Okay, I'll tell Jim you like him, though. -Okay, you do that."
00:14:18.899,00:14:20.150,"-All right, thanks. -All right."
00:14:20.234,00:14:23.529,Which means I got to get up at five-twenty-fucking-five.
00:14:24.446,00:14:25.906,Fucking shit.
00:14:27.575,00:14:29.827,"Fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck."
00:14:30.411,00:14:34.290,"So that I can come here and go, Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!"
00:14:34.665,00:14:37.001,"Oh, wait, I'm not coming here tomorrow, it's Tony."
00:14:39.628,00:14:42.256,I got some rest coming. I'll get some R&amp;R.
00:14:44.008,00:14:45.718,"It's okay, just leave it open."
00:14:45.801,00:14:48.679,"Don't worry about it, I don't give a damn. Understand?"
00:14:48.762,00:14:49.680,No problem.
00:14:55.519,00:14:56.437,I don't...
00:15:02.943,00:15:06.864,"Well, I know that Tony Clifton shows up once in a while where you're performing."
00:15:06.947,00:15:11.118,"Yes, well, uh, he's only on two occasions, really."
00:15:12.786,00:15:17.291,"This is true! I mean, you can have him on your show, you'll see for yourself if you think it's me."
00:15:17.374,00:15:20.461,"-I can assure you, you will... -I would love to have him on my show."
00:15:20.544,00:15:21.587,Can you arrange it?
00:15:21.670,00:15:23.797,"I can't, but you can find out his agent..."
00:15:23.881,00:15:26.675,Kaufman's been using my name to get places.
00:15:27.301,00:15:28.218,"And, uh..."
00:15:28.594,00:15:32.431,So there is no truth to the rumor that you're actually Andy Kaufman?
00:15:32.514,00:15:34.099,There's no truth to that whatsoever.
00:15:34.975,00:15:37.353,That's total fabrication on your part.
00:15:38.437,00:15:40.564,I didn't-- a lot of other people have said that.
00:15:40.648,00:15:43.317,"Yeah, I know, but many people say a lot of things."
00:15:50.407,00:15:51.867,"Okay, I got it, I got it!"
00:15:56.789,00:15:58.040,I got it! I got it!
00:16:09.635,00:16:12.721,I have some roses for all the beautiful girls in the world.
00:16:48.048,00:16:50.801,I heard Milos had to force him to go into makeup and hair.
00:16:56.432,00:16:59.768,"And when you put that Tony Clifton makeup on, there's no choice."
00:16:59.852,00:17:01.228,You're that guy.
00:17:01.311,00:17:02.438,He's here!
00:17:02.855,00:17:04.398,He has arrived!
00:17:07.443,00:17:08.652,The jowls.
00:17:08.736,00:17:15.200,"And it's scary at first, and then after a while you just go, Oh, my God, this is incredibly liberating."
00:17:16.660,00:17:19.371,"I want to introduce the head of the studio, Ron Meyer."
00:17:19.455,00:17:22.332,-It's nice meeting you. -Nice to meet you. Thanks for the gift.
00:17:26.795,00:17:29.840,I am not an Andy Kaufman fan. I do not like Andy Kaufman.
00:17:33.177,00:17:40.476,"of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest had to come to Tony and prostrate himself uh, to the great Tony Clifton."
00:17:40.559,00:17:51.361,"Uh, he had to come with his head down and-- and say, I know that you know much better than I do what is right for this scene."
00:17:52.112,00:18:02.539,"But if you could just do one-- one take where we try it this way, I would be so indebted to you for the rest of time!"
00:18:02.623,00:18:05.334,-Then you start. Say whatever you want. -Yeah. Okay.
00:18:05.417,00:18:07.419,"It's... you know, you can overlap."
00:18:07.878,00:18:11.548,-All right already! Okay! Okay! -You can overlap with his first line.
00:18:11.632,00:18:13.092,"-Okay, fine, fine. -Christ."
00:18:22.434,00:18:24.520,I need a director with backbone.
00:18:27.147,00:18:29.733,I'm starting a little production company of my own.
00:18:29.817,00:18:30.943,"-Oh, yeah? -Yeah."
00:18:31.026,00:18:32.194,Action!
00:18:33.487,00:18:34.822,"Taxi, waxi!"
00:18:34.905,00:18:36.615,"Just the faxi, Maxi!"
00:18:37.157,00:18:39.243,Them's all the words that rhyme with taxi.
00:18:39.326,00:18:40.285,Cut!
00:18:40.369,00:18:41.662,"Perfect, okay!"
00:18:44.289,00:18:48.127,"You take care of yourself, and make sure you come back in, you know, one piece."
00:18:48.210,00:18:50.712,-Absolutely. -Or two pieces would be nice too.
00:18:53.048,00:18:55.050,What do you mean? What's going on?
00:18:56.051,00:18:58.554,"What-- what, are they doing some kind of technical thing?"
00:18:59.221,00:19:00.055,Huh?
00:19:00.764,00:19:01.723,What's going on?
00:19:08.856,00:19:09.940,I'll check the sound.
00:19:14.486,00:19:15.362,It's working.
00:19:19.283,00:19:20.909,We're gonna have to deal with him.
00:19:26.832,00:19:30.586,He was just kind of a pain body who needed to point it at something.
00:19:31.128,00:19:33.422,And uh-- and he did. And he did.
00:19:33.505,00:19:40.512,"And generally, he pointed at the people that he felt were the loftiest, who thought they were better than him."
00:19:49.146,00:19:54.109,"and busted through the doors, and, uh, and wanted to see Steven Spielberg."
00:19:56.236,00:19:58.363,that is looking for Steven Spielberg.
00:20:04.578,00:20:07.748,that his movies didn't have to be so crowd-pleasing.
00:20:11.543,00:20:13.337,-I do a yak. -A yak?
00:20:13.420,00:20:15.047,That's right. Yak!
00:20:19.968,00:20:23.847,and had everybody out of their offices looking at what the hell was going on.
00:20:24.348,00:20:26.266,Trying to buy his way into heaven.
00:21:01.885,00:21:03.762,Ya! Ha!
00:21:04.429,00:21:06.890,I guess it's like a freakin' evolution poster!
00:21:08.058,00:21:11.186,Zmuda's a good man. I don't care what he wants to put in his mouth.
00:21:12.187,00:21:14.773,"I want something, goddamn it! That's what I want!"
00:21:16.692,00:21:17.693,It's freaking me out!
00:21:19.778,00:21:22.406,why someone would make a character that people hate?
00:21:22.739,00:21:28.287,"That a lot of people didn't even find funny, or like what the reason-- It's funny on a certain level."
00:21:28.829,00:21:30.998,"On an anarchist level, it's funny."
00:21:31.415,00:21:33.542,"Hey, look, there's Corey Feldman!"
00:21:34.001,00:21:35.460,It's Corey Feldman!
00:21:42.217,00:21:48.181,And it depends on how much you kind of resent that feeling of being an outsider.
00:21:48.265,00:21:49.933,-I'll sit over here. -Okay.
00:21:53.520,00:22:02.446,"Not only, like, in society, but in some parts of your own family, and, uh, how you just want to..."
00:22:02.946,00:22:04.573,you want to get someone's attention.
00:22:04.656,00:22:07.075,And I think that that's that.
00:22:07.576,00:22:09.494,"Like, How am I gonna get your attention?"
00:22:09.578,00:22:10.620,I am Andy.
00:22:12.247,00:22:13.248,Get out of here.
00:22:14.166,00:22:15.625,I've seen enough.
00:22:27.888,00:22:29.389,I think he's blowing it.
00:22:29.765,00:22:30.682,I can tell.
00:22:30.766,00:22:32.434,The eyes got a little buggy.
00:22:46.490,00:22:47.491,He's a coward.
00:22:50.869,00:22:52.204,-He's a coward. -Yeah.
00:22:55.207,00:22:59.044,"Yeah, I think at that time he was pretty-- he was pretty accurate, actually."
00:22:59.920,00:23:04.591,"You know, but there's, you know, there's truth, and then there's truth with charity."
00:23:05.008,00:23:07.761,I just wanted to tell him how much I enjoyed the shark.
00:23:08.178,00:23:11.014,"-The shark movie, Jaws. -That's right. That's right."
00:23:11.098,00:23:13.016,-Yeah. -He never did better than that!
00:23:14.309,00:23:17.646,Tell Jim we are doing Friday dinner.
00:23:17.729,00:23:18.647,Who and who?
00:23:19.147,00:23:20.357,You and me.
00:23:20.440,00:23:23.360,"-Who's you and me? I'm not going. -I know, but..."
00:23:28.782,00:23:39.209,"and he said, I have never dealt with anyone like Andy."
00:23:39.709,00:23:41.753,-I'll check with him. -Check and let me know.
00:23:41.837,00:23:43.338,"-I'll let you know. -Okay, good."
00:23:43.422,00:23:45.841,-I'll get him to call you. Okay. -Very good.
00:23:45.924,00:23:47.592,"-Very good, very good. -It's a deal."
00:23:47.676,00:23:49.678,"I'm so exhausted, you know."
00:23:49.761,00:23:51.763,-I am so exhausted. -I know. I understand.
00:23:54.182,00:24:00.230,I have never been intimidated by another man.
00:24:00.814,00:24:04.443,And I am intimidated by Tony Clifton!
00:24:05.318,00:24:06.278,"And, uh..."
00:24:06.695,00:24:08.864,"And I said, Well..."
00:24:09.781,00:24:14.578,we could fire them and I could do an impression.
00:24:14.661,00:24:16.872,I'm a really good impressionist.
00:24:16.955,00:24:20.208,"And I could do a pretty good imitation of both of them, I think."
00:24:20.876,00:24:22.919,And then there was silence on the phone.
00:24:23.628,00:24:24.504,And...
00:24:26.131,00:24:29.050,"Then Milos said, No."
00:24:30.886,00:24:32.471,I don't want to stop it.
00:24:33.930,00:24:35.807,I just wanted to talk to Jim.
00:24:48.987,00:24:50.155,I'm Batman.
00:25:18.767,00:25:22.562,I really had this feeling that someone else might be walking in also.
00:25:23.104,00:25:25.690,"-Oh, it's always a possibility. -Yeah, right."
00:25:31.238,00:25:36.117,"He has embodied Andy so much, and-- and all the different parts of Andy."
00:25:36.618,00:25:38.411,And he's put him somehow...
00:25:39.371,00:25:41.039,"He knows him, he understands him."
00:25:42.666,00:25:44.668,-Abu-day! -Abu-day!
00:25:44.751,00:25:46.920,-Aki-chay-wa! -Aki-chay-wa!
00:25:47.003,00:25:47.921,Hak-in-bo-day!
00:25:53.051,00:25:54.219,That's an odd question.
00:25:54.594,00:25:55.428,Uh...
00:25:57.973,00:26:01.101,"Um, I don't think I had before that, no."
00:26:01.184,00:26:02.769,Hello. Good to see you.
00:26:02.852,00:26:04.646,"-Good to see you too, Daddy. -Yeah."
00:26:05.480,00:26:07.065,"And, you know..."
00:26:11.069,00:26:12.153,-You are? -I am.
00:26:14.990,00:26:15.824,Whoa.
00:26:17.534,00:26:18.368,Okay.
00:26:20.662,00:26:21.496,"Bye, Andy."
00:26:22.289,00:26:23.123,Okay.
00:26:30.922,00:26:35.051,"they embraced me as Andy, as if I was family."
00:26:35.885,00:26:37.053,As if I was back.
00:26:38.138,00:26:45.395,I think that this movie's gonna be a celebration and also healing for everybody.
00:26:45.478,00:26:46.396,Yeah.
00:26:47.063,00:26:48.648,"You too, for you too."
00:26:50.358,00:26:51.318,For us.
00:26:57.115,00:26:58.867,I didn't know what was real and not.
00:26:59.284,00:27:04.748,You just went with Andy and Tony and wherever their whim took you.
00:27:05.206,00:27:09.502,And the emotions oftentimes were very real.
00:27:11.171,00:27:13.590,You want me not to tell you what I really feel?
00:27:14.591,00:27:17.969,"Oh, so you want-- okay, all right, that's what I need to know then."
00:27:18.595,00:27:20.889,"All right, then I won't tell you my concern."
00:27:20.972,00:27:22.265,I just want to be supported.
00:27:22.349,00:27:25.310,"If I want to choose to do something, you should support me."
00:27:25.393,00:27:29.564,"I mean, I don't understand why you're always negative, and you don't..."
00:27:29.648,00:27:38.823,"Gerry Becker, who was playing my father at one point, went crazy suddenly in the makeup trailer, started screaming at Andy as his father."
00:27:38.907,00:27:40.241,I'm angry because I love you.
00:27:40.325,00:27:43.244,I'm not angry 'cause I want to try to not give you support.
00:27:43.328,00:27:45.455,Too late! Too late!
00:27:59.552,00:28:00.387,It's okay.
00:28:05.225,00:28:06.476,I can't believe that.
00:28:10.730,00:28:11.564,Sorry.
00:28:18.363,00:28:20.824,I'm terrible. I'm terrible.
00:28:22.117,00:28:23.159,I'm terrible.
00:28:24.994,00:28:26.788,-I want you to be here. -I'm here.
00:28:26.871,00:28:28.206,I want you to be here.
00:28:28.289,00:28:30.625,It's just bizarre. It's so bizarre. It's so...
00:28:31.334,00:28:36.756,"This is what started happening all over, this kind of crazy melodrama happening everywhere."
00:28:39.843,00:28:46.641,"I am a star, and next time I come here, I want you all to get down on your knees and bow down to me!"
00:28:46.725,00:28:50.103,"And if I pass you by, kiss my feet!"
00:28:50.478,00:28:54.274,"You bunch of slimy hicks from Memphis, Tennessee!"
00:28:57.152,00:28:59.738,"Clear the fields and the farms, you little hicks!"
00:28:59.821,00:29:02.615,"I'll tell you something, you are not welcome here, okay?"
00:29:02.699,00:29:04.993,"You are not welcome here. All right, Lawler?"
00:29:05.452,00:29:06.578,I'm not afraid of you.
00:29:09.122,00:29:10.874,-Wait. -He's trying to scare me.
00:29:10.957,00:29:13.293,"-No, he doesn't scare me. -You have to work now."
00:29:13.376,00:29:14.669,"Andy, you are here to work."
00:29:16.629,00:29:18.256,Andy! Andy!
00:29:19.966,00:29:22.886,"Is that how you talk from Memphis, Tennessee, Mr. Lawler, huh?"
00:29:22.969,00:29:24.554,-Huh? Is that how you talk? -Andy!
00:29:24.637,00:29:27.932,You have to give me a chance to make a movie!
00:29:28.016,00:29:31.686,"I don't need to make a movie. I want a shot at him, that's what I want."
00:29:33.271,00:29:35.523,-What are we gonna do? -I don't know.
00:29:39.944,00:29:46.117,"Andy Kaufman, who, in his comedy routine in various nightclubs, would invite women up from the audience and would then wrestle them."
00:29:46.201,00:29:50.038,"He, uh, then began to name himself as the inter-gender champion."
00:29:50.121,00:29:54.000,He took it one step too far when he went up against Jerry The King Lawler.
00:29:54.083,00:29:55.710,-Remember that night? -Absolutely.
00:29:55.794,00:30:01.132,Jerry The King Lawler found out that Andy Kaufman is a comedian and not a professional wrestler.
00:30:04.260,00:30:05.762,he nails The Colossus.
00:30:06.095,00:30:07.096,Lawler's got him!
00:30:09.098,00:30:14.562,"Hart trying to get the big guy loose from the ropes, and look at Lawler go to work on him!"
00:30:18.316,00:30:20.068,He picks Andy up.
00:30:20.151,00:30:21.736,He's gonna suplex him.
00:30:27.742,00:30:28.827,is fighting me.
00:30:29.536,00:30:31.955,I'm the reason wrestling even exists now.
00:30:32.956,00:30:34.749,I'm the reason for Hulk Hogan.
00:30:40.255,00:30:42.924,"At the end, you have to be friends with him."
00:30:47.720,00:30:50.473,"You know, that's what really happened, but..."
00:30:50.557,00:30:51.933,"Well, I don't believe that."
00:30:52.016,00:30:53.852,I'll do anything you want me to do.
00:30:57.897,00:31:02.944,"I think that was a function also of coming from a different world, and he was wonderful."
00:31:03.319,00:31:04.863,"Uh... but, um..."
00:31:05.363,00:31:07.448,"And I really liked him, uh..."
00:31:07.532,00:31:16.708,"But, you know, Andy felt that it was necessary for him to stay in the character, so Andy stayed in the character."
00:31:16.791,00:31:18.376,"So, I don't care what you say."
00:31:18.459,00:31:22.088,"You can take your, you know, your fancy, like, wrestling moves."
00:31:22.171,00:31:25.216,Want to take a poke at me? Come on. I know all the pressure points.
00:31:25.300,00:31:27.135,"-Go find a girl to wrestle, okay? -Yeah?"
00:31:27.719,00:31:28.553,All right.
00:31:31.264,00:31:35.643,It was my understanding that you don't talk to Jim Carrey.
00:31:35.727,00:31:38.521,"-He's either Andy or nothing, you know. -Right."
00:31:41.190,00:31:43.151,You're screwing everything up in there.
00:31:47.822,00:31:51.326,"and the fact that, like you say, he is wanting to be so in character."
00:31:51.409,00:31:53.536,He is wanting to be Andy Kaufman.
00:31:53.620,00:31:54.746,He's a real goof.
00:31:59.626,00:32:04.589,"You know, in real life, Andy and I were actually friends, and we, you know, planned things together."
00:32:04.672,00:32:07.258,I didn't come here to be insulted. I'll walk right out.
00:32:07.342,00:32:11.888,"I'm used to being on big shows nationwide, not on a little rinky-dink local show."
00:32:15.183,00:32:16.100,this time.
00:32:18.853,00:32:22.482,"Can't stand to watch it anymore. Jerry, there's a little surprise."
00:32:22.565,00:32:24.108,And it's right behind you.
00:32:33.785,00:32:40.124,"When we're backstage, in front of just the people working on the movie, to stick a sign on somebody's back and to..."
00:32:40.500,00:32:45.630,"uh, throw water on you, you know, and stuff at my girlfriend, and that kind of stuff."
00:32:45.713,00:32:47.966,Once again proving Darwin's theory.
00:32:49.133,00:32:50.259,"Oh, man."
00:33:14.701,00:33:16.786,"He gets caught up in the part, man."
00:33:16.869,00:33:26.337,"And some of it becomes a little bit real, and some doesn't, you know, so if it escalates till somebody gets a broken nose, it escalates till somebody gets a broken nose."
00:33:32.969,00:33:37.807,"Jim had trouble later on, and it..."
00:33:38.683,00:33:42.979,"and it kind of threw him for a loop, and he got angry."
00:33:43.312,00:33:44.147,And...
00:33:44.647,00:33:48.317,"And he used that to express himself, you know?"
00:33:48.901,00:33:50.111,In many ways.
00:33:50.194,00:33:52.864,"There was a lot of anger in everything he did, but..."
00:33:54.574,00:34:00.580,"He's afraid if he gets healthy, he won't have creativity, sometimes."
00:34:08.671,00:34:23.686,"When I watch the footage of the stuff we took behind the scenes, I often wish that that was part of the movie, you know, that it had been married in the movie, because most people felt that the movie was happening behind the camera."
00:34:23.770,00:34:26.189,"Okay, now, let's do one more rehearsal."
00:34:27.148,00:34:28.941,Uh... Andy?
00:34:33.780,00:34:38.076,"What was the original intent with it, and how did it end up where we are today?"
00:34:39.410,00:34:53.466,"One of the things that I've always really been kind of annoyed by and I certainly-- I don't like things that look like actors are stiff, and they're standing in front of cameras and performing, and they do these things called electronic press kits."
00:34:54.175,00:35:00.014,"I always allow it, but it's never a comfortable thing for me to have someone lurking around with a camera."
00:35:00.098,00:35:01.516,It's always bothered me.
00:35:01.933,00:35:08.272,"So when they said they wanted to have an EPK, I said, I got Lynne Margulies here. She's a documentarian."
00:35:08.356,00:35:10.608,She was Andy Kaufman's girlfriend.
00:35:10.691,00:35:12.944,"She knows Andy really well, you know."
00:35:13.027,00:35:14.529,Bob Zmuda's here.
00:35:14.612,00:35:20.118,"He's a creative, you know, genius dude, who did all of Andy's stuff with him."
00:35:20.618,00:35:21.619,What's your name?
00:35:22.328,00:35:23.913,-Bob Zmuda. -Bob what?
00:35:23.996,00:35:25.540,-Bob Zmuda. -Zmuda?
00:35:25.998,00:35:27.416,"Bob what, Zmuda?"
00:35:27.792,00:35:29.085,Bob Zmuda?
00:35:31.337,00:35:34.841,"We'll get footage every day, and I was comfortable with them."
00:35:36.467,00:35:45.434,"I get a call last night from Jimmy who said that they are maneuvering, and they are gonna find a way, basically, to sequester the material."
00:35:49.480,00:35:50.356,Universal.
00:35:51.440,00:35:54.360,"Universal, Meyer, everybody."
00:35:54.443,00:35:58.823,"They just were like, Look, this is-- this is our project."
00:35:58.906,00:36:10.001,"I don't care if, you know, Jim Carrey wants to jack off all day long you know, he can fucking do whatever he wants, it's our movie, it's our set, it's our concept, and you're giving the stuff over."
00:36:14.172,00:36:16.465,allow any of that to surface...
00:36:17.049,00:36:19.427,so that people wouldn't think I was an asshole.
00:36:19.844,00:36:26.601,"And, uh, those were the words exactly that came back to me, that, We don't want people to think Jim's an asshole."
00:36:30.479,00:36:31.772,Jackie Kennedy.
00:36:32.064,00:36:33.316,"Oh. Ah, Christ!"
00:36:33.733,00:36:35.276,"Fuck, fuck, fuck!"
00:36:35.860,00:36:36.694,Ah!
00:36:38.237,00:36:39.530,"Oh, Christ."
00:36:45.745,00:36:48.581,"My name is Jim Carrey, this is my Saturday Night Live audition."
00:36:51.459,00:36:58.174,"The day I was auditioning for Saturday Night Live, I got out of my car, and I heard a voice say, Don't jump."
00:36:59.050,00:37:07.725,"I looked up at the top of the building, and there was an NBC page standing on the logo, trying to get the nerve up to jump off and kill himself."
00:37:08.392,00:37:10.353,"And I went, This is not gonna happen."
00:37:11.270,00:37:12.355,This is not gonna happen.
00:37:17.485,00:37:20.863,But I'd worked in factories. I had a ninth-grade education.
00:37:21.364,00:37:26.160,"And it's a series of, like, crushing disappointments, and I just go into a different gear."
00:37:26.244,00:37:30.498,"I go into Don't know how it's gonna right itself, but it will, you know?"
00:37:30.581,00:37:31.582,I don't know how.
00:37:32.708,00:37:36.504,He's been in Hollywood about ten months and created quite a bit of excitement.
00:37:36.587,00:37:39.882,This is his first appearance on American television. Welcome Jim Carrey.
00:37:39.966,00:37:40.800,Jim.
00:37:45.972,00:37:48.766,"And I said, No, it is something actually."
00:37:49.016,00:37:51.894,It's making it. I've made it. I'm on The Tonight Show.
00:37:55.189,00:37:58.985,"And they're all like, All right, okay. Hope it, uh, pans out."
00:38:08.452,00:38:17.837,"Just before everything started cooking for me, I think I might have been doing In Living Color already, I was driving down Melrose Boulevard by The Improv..."
00:38:18.796,00:38:21.882,I saw this psychic palm reader sign.
00:38:22.800,00:38:23.843,"And, uh..."
00:38:23.926,00:38:25.469,she gave me a reading.
00:38:26.220,00:38:28.055,And she said...
00:38:31.183,00:38:41.527,"You're about to do three things, three movies, that will be very, very, very big, and very important."
00:38:42.028,00:38:42.862,And...
00:38:43.904,00:38:44.905,after that...
00:38:46.032,00:38:50.286,it will be impossible for anyone to knock you down from that place.
00:38:52.371,00:38:56.709,"Shortly after that, I did Ace Ventura, The Mask, and Dumb and Dumber."
00:38:56.792,00:38:58.461,"La, la, la, la, la, la."
00:39:11.390,00:39:13.225,Ooh! That was perfect.
00:39:16.896,00:39:17.980,Excellent.
00:39:18.064,00:39:20.691,It's very funny because this is my old neighborhood.
00:39:21.317,00:39:22.526,Welcome!
00:39:22.610,00:39:24.236,-Hello! -Welcome! Welcome!
00:39:56.352,00:39:57.937,-Stop it! -Just kidding.
00:39:58.020,00:40:01.982,"-I'm only kidding, you know? That'll pass. -You're a sweet daisy."
00:40:02.066,00:40:05.403,"We didn't talk much, the minute she started playing me, I felt it was me."
00:40:05.486,00:40:07.738,She had little mannerisms. Didn't you think so?
00:40:10.116,00:40:12.868,"Yeah, she's great! I really felt like it was me."
00:40:13.369,00:40:15.413,She's really gonna kick my ass in wrestling.
00:40:18.082,00:40:18.916,She's strong.
00:40:20.084,00:40:23.254,"Taking the laundry in and stuff like that, all that stretching."
00:40:23.963,00:40:27.925,You're not gonna back out of this thing that you're gonna do today?
00:40:31.595,00:40:34.515,-Why don't you ever wrestle a man? -I'd rather wrestle a woman.
00:40:39.728,00:40:44.859,"and the taunting, and the whatever, and touching the emotional and sociological buttons."
00:40:45.276,00:40:54.869,"Now, I'm not saying women are mentally inferior to men because when it comes to things like cooking and cleaning, washing the potatoes, carrots, raising the babies..."
00:40:55.286,00:40:57.413,"...making the babies, mopping the floors."
00:40:58.497,00:41:00.541,They have it all over men. I believe that.
00:41:01.000,00:41:02.585,But when it comes to wrestling...
00:41:04.462,00:41:07.631,Be quiet when the man is talking!
00:41:07.715,00:41:14.847,"The whole women's movement was exploding at that time, and he went the other way and said they should be in the kitchen, and all this stuff."
00:41:14.930,00:41:19.852,"He just was on his own wavelength, and you were either gonna join or you weren't."
00:41:19.935,00:41:24.148,And he seemed to thrive off those who didn't.
00:41:24.732,00:41:28.068,"God, men, women, dog."
00:41:30.070,00:41:34.492,"It was like when Jesus said, you know, Eat my body and drink my blood."
00:41:34.575,00:41:36.952,"It's a way to, like, weed out the crowd."
00:41:37.453,00:41:39.914,Those people who don't see anything past the literal...
00:41:39.997,00:41:41.332,Please do Foreign Man.
00:41:41.624,00:41:43.584,"-Please. Please. -No, I hate that."
00:41:48.839,00:41:50.049,He's not interested in them.
00:41:52.885,00:41:54.512,Do Latka!
00:41:56.639,00:41:58.015,Here's Latka's ass.
00:42:03.270,00:42:05.439,Andy was a big Beat Generation guy.
00:42:11.403,00:42:13.447,Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
00:42:13.531,00:42:23.165,"And I think also I'm glad, you know, I expressed that thing about the, Thank you very much, thank you very much, 'cause every comic that gets a catchphrase like that goes crazy with it."
00:42:24.875,00:42:30.714,"Ultimately, that kind of stuff chews you up, and it might've chewed him up a little bit."
00:42:30.798,00:42:34.426,"Drives them crazy, the very thing that makes them famous."
00:42:39.348,00:42:44.812,"You know, it's not-- it's not Jim Carrey who can walk down the street just, uh..."
00:42:45.145,00:42:49.858,"you know, doing anything he wants to and get away with it, because nobody knows you."
00:42:49.942,00:42:55.614,"You know, after a while, hopefully, it'll be to the point where I can't walk out on the street. Won't that be fun?"
00:42:58.576,00:43:02.955,Where it'll be impossible to walk anywhere without being recognized.
00:43:05.124,00:43:17.469,"At some point, when you create yourself to make it, uh, you're going to have to either let that creation go, and..."
00:43:18.053,00:43:27.396,"and take a chance on being loved or hated for who you really are, or you're gonna have to kill who you really are..."
00:43:28.856,00:43:34.737,and fall into your grave grasping onto a character that you never were.
00:43:40.743,00:43:42.578,Sure you're not gonna miss this guy?
00:43:43.078,00:43:44.997,"When he's gone, all that's left is me."
00:43:51.962,00:43:54.340,Everything speaks to me. It's the weirdest thing.
00:43:54.423,00:44:06.268,"Every movie I've gotten in my life, I could trace any movie, and I could tell you somehow how that was the absolute manifestation of my consciousness at that time."
00:44:07.394,00:44:10.648,"I was Truman, I was in the bubble at that time."
00:44:11.273,00:44:14.151,Peter Weir knew that. He cast me because of it.
00:44:14.610,00:44:16.779,"Hello? Come in, Major Burbank."
00:44:29.249,00:44:31.627,Eternal Sunshine was so much...
00:44:32.461,00:44:34.254,I was very heartbroken.
00:44:35.381,00:44:38.676,And she looks at me like she doesn't even know who I am.
00:44:39.343,00:44:40.260,Excuse me?
00:44:41.637,00:44:43.055,"Can I help you find something, sir?"
00:44:46.058,00:44:49.311,"My God, I have to erase this from my mind."
00:44:49.395,00:44:50.688,Patrick!
00:44:50.771,00:44:52.314,Baby boy!
00:44:56.318,00:44:58.195,I felt like I had been erased.
00:44:58.779,00:45:00.739,"Let me know if you need something, sir."
00:45:01.824,00:45:07.287,"My name is Joel Barish, and I'm here to erase Clementine Kruczynski."
00:45:07.371,00:45:15.504,"When I met Michel Gondry, he looked at me over lunch, and he said, Oh, my God, you're so beautiful."
00:45:16.296,00:45:18.173,You're so beautiful right now.
00:45:18.674,00:45:19.883,You're so broken.
00:45:20.592,00:45:21.552,I love this.
00:45:21.927,00:45:23.303,Please don't get well.
00:45:23.846,00:45:29.852,"You know, because the movie wasn't shooting for another year, so he asked me not to get well."
00:45:31.311,00:45:33.856,That's how fucked up this business is.
00:45:34.565,00:45:35.649,Degenerate.
00:45:36.859,00:45:38.152,You guys don't smoke.
00:45:38.569,00:45:41.613,"-What the hell are you doing smoking? -Smoking, choking, joking."
00:45:41.697,00:45:42.531,Boking.
00:45:42.614,00:45:44.366,And this fucking is ridiculous.
00:45:44.700,00:45:46.535,It's ridiculous. I don't smoke.
00:45:47.119,00:45:51.540,"In your dream, is it you in the dream, is it Andy, or is it Tony?"
00:45:51.623,00:45:55.335,"It's everybody. Everybody's in the dream, and they're all pulling, you know."
00:45:55.419,00:45:58.213,I had a wrestling match with Andy and Tony last night.
00:45:59.256,00:46:02.426,Every actor goes through it when they take on a role for a long time.
00:46:02.509,00:46:04.261,"You've heard the stories, you know."
00:46:20.736,00:46:22.279,You stink!
00:46:37.461,00:46:38.504,Where's my chair?
00:46:39.505,00:46:42.549,"-This is the, uh... production trailer. -Huh?"
00:46:42.633,00:46:44.218,This is the production trailer.
00:46:44.551,00:46:46.929,-Production trailer? -What are you looking for?
00:46:47.262,00:46:49.598,"-I thought it was the makeup trailer. -Oh, no."
00:47:19.002,00:47:21.255,"I don't know, but he stunk to high heaven."
00:47:24.341,00:47:25.175,I don't know.
00:47:28.679,00:47:30.305,Yeah. Especially Tony.
00:47:31.014,00:47:33.559,"-Does he ever get out of bed as Tony? -Uh, yes."
00:47:35.269,00:47:37.771,-Whose trailer is that we're paying for? -That's Jim Carrey.
00:47:37.855,00:47:38.689,Oh.
00:47:38.981,00:47:41.275,He's not been to work. Jim never comes to work.
00:47:41.358,00:47:45.654,"He's done very, very little work on this project, and yet, he will get a lot of the glory."
00:47:57.916,00:48:00.669,Tried to have a bottle of wine with him the other night.
00:48:01.044,00:48:02.462,Got all freakin' negative.
00:48:03.005,00:48:06.466,"That's right. Jim was upset, and I told him that's just fear."
00:48:07.175,00:48:08.385,That's fear talking.
00:48:15.517,00:48:20.439,He's afraid he might not be recognized for the almighty powerful creativity force that he is!
00:48:27.362,00:48:34.494,"Especially when you play characters, because when you improvise, the choices you make are always very revealing of who you are."
00:48:34.578,00:48:36.872,He came from alcoholic grandparents.
00:48:36.955,00:48:39.541,Because there's really nothing in there but the truth.
00:48:39.625,00:48:40.751,He knows fair talk.
00:48:42.753,00:48:44.421,Where did this character come from?
00:48:44.504,00:48:46.632,What is the dirt...
00:48:47.466,00:48:50.218,that the pearl is built around?
00:48:50.302,00:49:04.566,"And the pearl is the personality you build around yourself as a protection against that thought, If they ever find out that I'm worthless, if they ever find out that I'm not enough, I'll be destroyed."
00:49:08.403,00:49:09.655,"Yeah, he's all right."
00:49:11.281,00:49:14.451,Always smiling all the time. You can tell it's not real.
00:49:21.416,00:49:34.471,"I was a seven-year-old kid who would, when my father's face was beet red, and my grandfather had cornered him for like three hours and told him what a loser he is, um..."
00:49:34.554,00:49:37.307,"when they left, I was Grandpa Jack."
00:49:37.849,00:49:39.893,"Goddammit, Percy!"
00:49:39.977,00:49:41.645,"You're a loser, Percy."
00:49:42.062,00:49:45.565,"You're a loser, but you're a hell of a guy!"
00:49:46.483,00:49:47.442,You know.
00:49:47.526,00:49:51.947,And I eventually turned that into the Dysfunctional Family Home Show on In Living Color.
00:49:53.532,00:49:58.537,"Listen, son, I just want you to know that I love you."
00:49:58.620,00:50:01.540,I think you're a hell of a guy.
00:50:07.921,00:50:15.262,"My father was not only the funniest man in the room, but he was a fantastic saxophone player."
00:50:15.595,00:50:18.974,"And before I was born, he had an orchestra in Toronto."
00:50:19.516,00:50:27.065,"But, you know, in order to be something special, you had to leave Canada and come down to the States and prove yourself in the States."
00:50:27.149,00:50:33.363,"He was a little bit afraid of that transition, and also he had a family to take care of, so he became an accountant."
00:50:33.989,00:50:38.744,"And as time wore on, it wore him down, you know."
00:50:38.827,00:50:44.666,"It wore him down, and he got a little bit bitter, especially when he lost his job when he was 51."
00:50:45.333,00:50:46.918,"Uh, that really broke him."
00:50:47.002,00:50:56.261,"Not only was he compromising to raise a family, but when you compromise and you fail, it really hurts."
00:50:56.636,00:50:59.473,It hurts even more than failing at what you love.
00:50:59.556,00:51:01.767,So that was an example for me.
00:51:01.850,00:51:04.352,"A lot of people don't know this, but, uh..."
00:51:04.436,00:51:09.900,"but when I was about 14 or 15, my father lost his job, and I actually became homeless for quite some time."
00:51:09.983,00:51:14.029,"Of course, I grew up in Canada, so I thought we'd just gone camping, you know."
00:51:14.112,00:51:14.946,But...
00:51:15.030,00:51:20.911,"I learned that you can fail at what you don't love, so you might as well do what you love."
00:51:21.620,00:51:23.747,There's really no choice to be made.
00:51:38.470,00:51:41.473,"What you want to be, you know?"
00:51:42.974,00:51:50.148,"It's like my old man didn't get to see everything, but he saw it happen, and it's happened for him as much as it did for me."
00:51:50.607,00:51:52.609,"You know, so, that's why I get emotional."
00:51:52.692,00:51:55.403,"Everybody gets emotional when they talk about their dad, but..."
00:51:55.487,00:51:56.446,"But, uh..."
00:51:56.530,00:51:59.991,But he truly was a friggin' amazing human being.
00:52:33.900,00:52:35.527,"Yeah, breakfast burrito."
00:52:38.488,00:52:40.115,Don't-- don't mess around.
00:52:41.491,00:52:43.160,"No, no, we don't mess around."
00:52:50.125,00:52:55.297,at least eight or nine people in this production are gonna sue this production for mental stress.
00:52:55.380,00:52:57.674,That would be different than a regular production?
00:52:58.508,00:53:01.845,Eight dollars for a fucking bottle of water. That's a rip off!
00:53:01.928,00:53:03.930,"You know, that's Andy Kaufman's right-hand man."
00:53:04.014,00:53:05.807,"-Oh, yeah? -I swear."
00:53:06.933,00:53:09.686,You ever see the wrestling stuff? He's always the ref.
00:53:10.562,00:53:13.899,"There were two Tony Cliftons, there was Andy Kaufman and Bob Zmuda."
00:53:18.778,00:53:27.162,"You know, they used to do things like go to the zoo and run through the zoo screaming, The lion's out! The lion's out! and stuff like that."
00:53:27.245,00:53:30.332,"Here, I'll show you humor. That's humor! That's humor, man!"
00:53:30.415,00:53:35.045,And he was responsible for a lot of the Tony Clifton stuff as much as Andy was.
00:53:35.128,00:53:37.672,Those two together were in cahoots.
00:53:44.638,00:53:46.640,"-This is a test. -Okay, that's Bob."
00:53:49.059,00:53:53.396,And so Andy would book Lake Tahoe and never show up there.
00:53:53.772,00:54:00.987,And it would be Bob Zmuda as Tony Clifton who would show up and cause all this insanity to happen.
00:54:01.071,00:54:04.908,And the people who hired him think it's Andy Kaufman.
00:54:05.450,00:54:09.412,I need this gig like I need a gunshot blast to the face!
00:54:10.247,00:54:11.957,"Jesus, what a fucking nut."
00:54:13.458,00:54:16.044,That's what I'm talking about right there!
00:54:16.753,00:54:19.297,"You want to see some humor, huh? You want to see some humor?"
00:54:19.381,00:54:21.049,"There's humor right there, huh."
00:54:24.427,00:54:26.846,and a lot of people thought he was abusing me before.
00:54:30.350,00:54:32.686,"They're like, What, is he serious with you?"
00:54:32.769,00:54:34.145,"You're a day player, right?"
00:54:34.229,00:54:36.898,"I'm like, I don't know what the fuck-- what did I do?"
00:54:36.982,00:54:39.901,That's some humor to me! Now you just sit down and enjoy that!
00:54:39.985,00:54:41.945,"Okay? Ha, ha, ha, ha! Real funny!"
00:54:47.909,00:54:58.128,"As soon as he saw how far I was going into the character, he became the old Bob, and it brought him to life, and he was back in business."
00:55:09.764,00:55:17.814,"My guys called the mansion, and said, Look, Jim's not really on the planet right now."
00:55:18.315,00:55:19.858,"He's Andy, he's Tony."
00:55:20.317,00:55:22.819,And Tony would like to come to the mansion.
00:55:25.030,00:55:28.742,"You better check with Hef, or you will never see me here again!"
00:55:28.825,00:55:32.287,"-I got some asshole at the gate here. -Okay, that's it. Who said that?"
00:55:32.746,00:55:34.372,Which one of you said that?
00:55:37.751,00:55:47.594,"doing a bit outside and stuff like that, thinking he was doing a bit with Jim Carrey, while I was at In-N-Out Burger having burgers and chocolate milkshakes."
00:55:49.054,00:55:50.430,-Hello. -How you doing?
00:55:51.473,00:55:53.183,Where are you gonna be later?
00:55:54.434,00:55:56.686,-That cannot be Jim Carrey. -There's no way.
00:55:59.272,00:56:00.774,I hate him now!
00:56:00.857,00:56:02.108,I hate him!
00:56:06.446,00:56:13.078,"and, you know, Hugh had invited him in, and posed with the Playboy girls, and all this stuff, I showed up."
00:56:13.495,00:56:14.996,"Hi, how you doing?"
00:56:15.538,00:56:24.464,"Hugh was standing with Bob Zmuda, and he turned and looked at me, He went white as a ghost."
00:56:24.547,00:56:28.176,He says somebody called the freakin' office. Somebody called his office.
00:56:28.676,00:56:30.095,How do I get out of here?
00:56:31.012,00:56:32.972,"Get that fucking camera off, too."
00:56:44.442,00:56:45.777,I am being kicked out.
00:56:54.494,00:57:06.673,"Then for two-and-a-half years he wouldn't use anything I wrote because he's now going on Saturday Night Live, and he has the whole laundry list of Cow Goes Moo, Mighty Mouse, you know, of all that stuff."
00:57:06.756,00:57:08.591,-He doesn't have to... -Doesn't have it.
00:57:08.675,00:57:19.936,"As soon as he goes through all that and there's nothing left, 'cause he has no more of the trial bag left, he gets on the phone and calls Zmuda to come up from San Diego, 'cause he's definitely creatively bankrupt."
00:57:22.772,00:57:25.859,And then I take over Kaufman's job.
00:57:27.026,00:57:29.654,And then the film becomes Zmuda!
00:57:33.366,00:57:40.415,"every role in this movie is someone who came in contact with Andy in this special life, and they all want..."
00:57:41.624,00:57:50.675,"everybody wants to be the most important person to Andy, Or the most important person in that mix, whatever happened, you know. And..."
00:57:52.010,00:57:54.012,It's all about identity. Identity.
00:57:54.304,00:57:55.763,And God...
00:57:56.139,00:57:59.225,"this movie has turned out to be so much about that, you know?"
00:57:59.767,00:58:02.604,About all of our identities. What we need.
00:58:07.859,00:58:10.445,"and if you'd like to say a few things, we're ready."
00:58:15.492,00:58:16.618,And you're on.
00:58:23.041,00:58:23.875,S...
00:58:24.667,00:58:25.502,S...
00:58:26.085,00:58:28.671,"Spring was never waiting for us, girl."
00:58:29.631,00:58:38.681,"It ran one step ahead as we followed in the dance between the parted pages, and were pressed in love's hot, fevered iron like a striped..."
00:58:54.656,00:58:56.658,Is that my dad? Huh? Huh?
00:58:56.741,00:58:58.284,"It is! Oh, jeez."
00:58:58.743,00:59:00.745,Holy moly. I'm tripping.
00:59:06.459,00:59:13.967,"And I know they know I'm not their son, obviously, but it's been like almost like role-playing therapy."
00:59:15.426,00:59:18.680,"A bit, where, you know, they get to talk to him."
00:59:18.763,00:59:20.515,You guys are here. This is great.
00:59:22.725,00:59:30.024,"Andy heard that his daughter wanted to come down to the theatre and, uh, speak to him."
00:59:31.818,00:59:34.946,"And so, she came down, and she, uh..."
00:59:35.572,00:59:42.078,"You know, Andy had had her out of wedlock when he was a teenager, and, uh..."
00:59:42.161,00:59:48.376,"she was, uh, put up for adoption, and she didn't know who her dad was until he was on Taxi."
00:59:48.876,00:59:53.339,"And then someone somehow got to her and, uh..."
00:59:53.423,00:59:54.924,and told her that...
00:59:55.300,00:59:59.345,"uh, that that was her dad, uh, who was Latka on Taxi."
00:59:59.929,01:00:00.888,"And, uh..."
01:00:01.472,01:00:04.183,And she never got to meet him before he passed away.
01:00:04.726,01:00:12.066,"So that day, she came into Andy's trailer, and..."
01:00:13.401,01:00:14.777,talked to her father...
01:00:15.737,01:00:18.448,alone for an hour or more.
01:00:19.240,01:00:20.074,And...
01:00:21.826,01:00:24.495,telling each other that they love each other and...
01:00:25.163,01:00:32.920,"and exploring the reasons why it happened like it happened, and where he is now."
01:00:36.799,01:00:38.509,"That's kind of touching, that one."
01:00:41.220,01:00:45.850,"'Cause, you know, Lynne and I talked about it a lot, where would Andy be now?"
01:00:46.267,01:00:51.230,"And she always believed that he would be in heaven uh, taking care of the kids."
01:00:52.065,01:00:53.024,You know.
01:00:53.107,01:00:54.734,Playing games with the kids.
01:01:01.282,01:01:03.993,"Hi, I'm Andy Kaufman, and last year I was in a..."
01:01:04.535,01:01:08.373,wrestling match with a professional wrestler by the name of Jerry Lawler.
01:01:09.040,01:01:15.797,"Uh, I would say the match was unfair, being Jerry Lawler was twice my size, and I wasn't prepared for what had happened."
01:01:15.880,01:01:21.803,"What happened was he used an illegal hold called a pile driver, where he banged my head into the mat..."
01:01:25.014,01:01:25.848,"Hi, guys!"
01:01:26.516,01:01:27.475,How are you?
01:01:31.020,01:01:32.271,Seem very nice to me.
01:01:39.404,01:01:41.531,Don't start any trouble and there won't be any.
01:01:42.740,01:01:44.325,I think it's Dracula!
01:01:46.577,01:01:48.788,"Elvis called, he wants his shit back!"
01:01:53.501,01:01:54.919,"At that point, it was..."
01:01:55.378,01:01:57.588,"It was not me, you know? It was not me."
01:01:57.672,01:02:00.550,I was not making choices based on what Jim does.
01:02:01.134,01:02:03.219,I was making choices based on what Andy does.
01:02:03.302,01:02:08.558,And Andy does the choice that makes you want to leap over the barrier and throttle him.
01:02:08.641,01:02:09.684,Shut up!
01:02:14.105,01:02:18.109,"and as far as I can remember, it was like he was very well-mannered."
01:02:18.192,01:02:22.655,"I mean, he always referred to me as Mr. Lawler, that sort of stuff. He-- I mean, uh..."
01:02:22.739,01:02:27.452,"Jim Carrey's coming up behind me, doing all this kind of stuff, shoving me."
01:02:28.453,01:02:29.454,Oh! Oh!
01:02:29.537,01:02:30.663,You all right?
01:02:31.247,01:02:32.248,He pushed me off.
01:02:34.208,01:02:37.044,-Until you are lift for the pile driver. -Okay.
01:02:37.128,01:02:39.964,"After the side suplex, he will gently put you down."
01:02:40.047,01:02:41.174,-Uh-huh. -Okay?
01:02:49.932,01:02:51.225,and then he put him down.
01:02:51.726,01:02:56.022,"They'll know it when they see the cut. It's like, Stuntman, enter now."
01:02:56.105,01:02:59.275,"-They're pretty savvy, audiences today. -They are savvy."
01:02:59.358,01:03:01.110,They can spot a stuntman a mile away.
01:03:01.194,01:03:07.116,"He came down and said the insurance companies weren't gonna have it, and they were gonna shut down production and do all these things."
01:03:07.200,01:03:09.952,I'm not really okay. I feel like I'm being duped.
01:03:10.453,01:03:11.621,"Oh, come on!"
01:03:11.704,01:03:12.538,I do.
01:03:13.623,01:03:16.083,"You think I'm kidding, you think it's a bit. It's not."
01:03:16.167,01:03:20.004,I'm gonna do it whether the cameras are rolling or set up for it or not.
01:03:20.087,01:03:34.477,"And that's when all hell broke loose, when Andy started accusing him of being an establishment player, and a guy who's afraid of the insurance companies, and afraid to do something outrageous, and afraid to be an artist."
01:03:35.937,01:03:40.483,"I think, you know, he'll be primed and ready, 'cause I know how to ring his buttons, push him."
01:03:40.566,01:03:43.444,He was supposed to come to Jim Carrey's house for dinner!
01:03:45.196,01:03:46.823,Shut up! Shut up!
01:04:16.519,01:04:18.479,Everybody back. Everybody back.
01:04:27.321,01:04:29.323,how far should I take this?
01:04:30.658,01:04:32.535,"You know, how far would Andy take it?"
01:04:40.293,01:04:42.753,"Ow, ow, ow, ow."
01:04:44.255,01:04:47.091,My people didn't know if I was hurt.
01:04:48.134,01:04:50.386,My managers didn't know if I was hurt.
01:04:51.387,01:04:52.471,No one knew.
01:04:52.555,01:04:53.973,We're very disappointed.
01:04:54.640,01:05:00.062,"Uh, Mr. Lawler, who is a professional wrestler, we felt acted unprofessionally."
01:05:00.479,01:05:04.942,There's a small swelling in his left sternocleidomastoid muscle.
01:05:05.026,01:05:11.574,"We have reports that Jim Carrey had somehow egged on Lawler, perhaps had spit in his face."
01:05:11.657,01:05:16.037,"Well, he did spit in his face as Andy had done years ago in Memphis."
01:05:16.120,01:05:21.834,"So, Jim playing Andy performed as Andy in what happened years ago."
01:05:21.918,01:05:23.878,Jim Carrey was shooting a scene...
01:05:25.796,01:05:29.050,This was a wrestling match with a crowd of extras in the audience.
01:05:29.133,01:05:30.718,Jerry turned around real angry...
01:05:31.385,01:05:32.720,That's amazing.
01:05:36.307,01:05:40.102,Jim Carrey is refusing to ever work with Jerry Lawler again.
01:05:40.186,01:05:42.271,It just all has tumbled into each other.
01:05:42.355,01:05:43.856,It became a piece.
01:05:45.358,01:05:49.278,"And it's, like, on the news, the real news."
01:05:49.362,01:05:52.990,"For those of us that remember him, it is a little Kaufman-esque, isn't it?"
01:05:53.074,01:05:55.117,"It really is, we'll see. People in..."
01:06:05.378,01:06:06.253,"Oh, my God."
01:06:06.337,01:06:09.757,"They're up on fences, they're up on balconies in the apartments."
01:06:14.011,01:06:18.975,"and there's like a feeling of like of responsibility, or like guilt, or..."
01:06:19.809,01:06:24.897,"Yeah, there's feelings of guilt, feelings of, like, Did I go too far, did I...?"
01:06:25.773,01:06:27.900,"Ooh, boy, that, uh..."
01:06:28.526,01:06:31.278,that was a lot. I hope I don't get in trouble. I...
01:06:31.362,01:06:34.699,Should I tell them? Should I tell people? Should I not tell people?
01:06:34.782,01:06:38.494,"And I probably should never have told people, but I don't know."
01:06:39.412,01:06:42.623,I'm not the same personality as Andy. Andy would never tell you.
01:06:45.793,01:06:48.004,to be transported to a hospital.
01:06:51.716,01:06:54.051,not stopping when the cameras stopped.
01:06:57.096,01:07:03.185,"He wasn't about there's a section of time here where we act like the character, then it's over."
01:07:03.269,01:07:07.940,"You know, he came in to turn reality on its head."
01:07:08.024,01:07:10.818,He's in the intensive care unit at St. Francis Hospital.
01:07:10.901,01:07:14.155,To completely blur the lines.
01:07:15.406,01:07:16.282,Are you ready?
01:07:16.699,01:07:18.409,Jim Carrey!
01:07:23.414,01:07:26.917,"I mean, I remember going on Arsenio Hall..."
01:07:27.251,01:07:31.088,"uh, during the riots, you know, and, uh..."
01:07:31.505,01:07:36.635,"with a bottle of wine in my hand, and acting like I'm shit-faced drunk."
01:07:37.511,01:07:39.055,"Hey, you're not Jay."
01:07:42.475,01:07:46.312,"And I thought I was really over the top, but people really were concerned."
01:07:46.395,01:07:48.272,"I mean, they were completely concerned."
01:07:48.355,01:07:53.819,"And then I called him a black bastard, and took a feeble swing at him, and fell on the ground."
01:07:53.903,01:07:56.864,You black bastard!
01:08:02.036,01:08:05.664,-We'll take a commercial-- be right back. -That's for Reginald Denny!
01:08:11.796,01:08:16.383,"I went backstage, he was leaning his head against the wall like this, and he had just this..."
01:08:17.259,01:08:19.428,the blood had drained out of him.
01:08:20.137,01:08:23.557,"And he was like, I don't know, man. I don't know, man."
01:08:24.517,01:08:27.228,"You might have done some bad stuff out there, man."
01:08:27.978,01:08:29.772,You might've... you might've...
01:08:29.855,01:08:31.273,"you might've blown it, man."
01:08:31.899,01:08:36.987,"You know, it was one of those moments where I went, This is what Andy felt all the time."
01:08:37.780,01:08:39.615,This is what he faced all the time.
01:08:43.119,01:08:46.622,"Tonight, for the first time on network television, they meet face-to-face."
01:08:46.705,01:08:49.041,Here are Andy Kaufman and Jerry Lawler.
01:08:56.882,01:09:00.761,It was just sort of a-- sort of a thinking on the same level type thing.
01:09:01.137,01:09:07.226,"It was just something that kind of happened, and afterwards, you know, it turned out good for everybody."
01:09:12.398,01:09:15.234,Look at Dave's face! He won't even look over there!
01:09:15.985,01:09:17.862,He will not even look over there.
01:09:21.740,01:09:24.493,for any kind of eventuality in this situation.
01:09:24.577,01:09:26.036,We're hoping it goes smoothly.
01:09:28.581,01:09:29.915,-Just fine. -Good to see you.
01:09:29.999,01:09:30.833,All right.
01:09:30.916,01:09:32.835,"-A lot of shit went down, huh? -Yes, it did."
01:09:32.918,01:09:34.628,"-A lot of shit went down. -Yes, it did."
01:09:34.712,01:09:38.424,I just wanted to say that today-- -Eggs just went down a while ago. -Huh?
01:09:38.507,01:09:40.801,-Some eggs went down a while ago. -What do you mean?
01:09:47.808,01:09:49.310,That's only a little bit of that.
01:09:51.645,01:09:54.398,"and discussed how he was supposed to miss me, and..."
01:09:55.191,01:09:56.025,and...
01:09:56.859,01:09:57.693,uh...
01:09:58.569,01:10:06.493,"Andy, me, whoever, leaned over just before it began and said, Hit me."
01:10:07.119,01:10:08.329,"I mean, really hit me."
01:10:19.757,01:10:20.758,Take a break.
01:10:22.968,01:10:25.179,"You're just poor white trash. So, I guess..."
01:10:27.765,01:10:29.308,"I mean, what are you gonna do?"
01:10:35.564,01:10:36.523,"Oh, fuck."
01:10:43.822,01:10:48.118,"I'm sick of this shit, okay? I am sick of this fucking shit, okay?!"
01:10:48.661,01:10:51.872,"You are full of shit, Lawler. I'm gonna sue you for everything..."
01:10:54.792,01:10:55.626,Fuck you!
01:10:55.709,01:10:57.503,"You know, it's just creativity."
01:10:57.586,01:10:58.587,Fuck you!
01:10:58.671,01:11:00.673,This stuff doesn't matter.
01:11:02.049,01:11:10.349,"I come out of Mr. Chow's or something like that, or The Ivy, on Robertson there, which is like the paparazzi..."
01:11:11.225,01:11:12.935,"you know, mecca."
01:11:13.560,01:11:14.520,"And, uh..."
01:11:15.354,01:11:19.817,"one time I came out of there, and I-- and I decided, Okay, I'm gonna..."
01:11:20.818,01:11:22.111,I'm gonna stand here.
01:11:23.320,01:11:25.948,"I'm not gonna say anything, and I'm gonna wait."
01:11:26.865,01:11:28.784,And it suddenly got quiet.
01:11:29.576,01:11:32.705,And I'm just standing in front of The Ivy restaurant.
01:11:33.539,01:11:36.875,"And they said, What are you doing?"
01:11:39.003,01:11:40.421,"I said, Nothing."
01:11:48.595,01:11:51.140,"That was great. That's it, that's perfect!"
01:11:51.765,01:11:55.185,"Andy, put some of this on it for now. We'll get it in a rag."
01:11:56.937,01:11:57.896,Cue the sun.
01:12:04.528,01:12:05.738,-Jeez! -What time is it?
01:12:07.114,01:12:08.615,"Christof, what's going on?"
01:12:09.325,01:12:11.744,You know there's a rumour circulating that he's dead?
01:12:14.913,01:12:22.212,"and it's nothing more than that, it's an illusion, and that you should be up here watching it -That's it. -rather than being caught up..."
01:12:31.597,01:12:35.934,"The door is the realization that this, us..."
01:12:36.602,01:12:37.436,is...
01:12:38.729,01:12:42.691,seaside. It's-- It's the dome. This is the dome.
01:12:43.192,01:12:46.570,"This isn't real, you know? This is a story."
01:12:50.199,01:13:03.087,"There's the avatar you create and the cadence you come up with that is pleasing to people, and takes them away from their issues, and it makes you popular, and then at some point, you have to peel it away."
01:13:03.170,01:13:05.297,"And, you know, it's not who you are."
01:13:06.090,01:13:09.218,He has the world's most recognizable face. He can't disappear.
01:13:10.677,01:13:13.764,"At some point, you have to live, you know, your true man."
01:13:13.847,01:13:16.100,"I mean, Truman Show really became a..."
01:13:16.642,01:13:19.103,-Again. Hit him again. -a prophecy for me.
01:13:22.106,01:13:41.542,"It is constantly reaffirming itself as a-- as a teaching almost, as a-- as a real representation of what I've gone through in my career, and what everybody goes through when they create themselves, you know, to be popular or to be successful."
01:13:41.625,01:13:45.337,"And it's not just show business. It's Wall Street, it's anywhere."
01:13:45.421,01:13:55.347,"You go to the office, put a monkey suit on, act a certain way, say a certain thing, and lie through your teeth at times, and you do whatever you need to do to look like a winner, you know."
01:13:55.431,01:14:01.186,"And then at some point of your life, you have to-- you have to go, I don't care what it looks like. You know."
01:14:01.270,01:14:04.773,I found the hole in the psyche and I'm going through.
01:14:05.315,01:14:14.158,"And-- and I'm gonna face the abyss of not knowing whether that's gonna be okay with everybody or not, you know."
01:14:14.241,01:14:15.200,Um...
01:14:15.284,01:14:20.164,"And at times, you know, just like the movie, they try to drown you in the middle of that abyss."
01:14:20.706,01:14:24.084,"They go, No, be the other guy. You told us you were this guy."
01:14:24.835,01:14:26.211,You told us you were Andy.
01:14:26.628,01:14:28.380,You told us you were Tony Clifton.
01:14:28.839,01:14:31.049,"You know, no one can live with that forever."
01:14:45.022,01:14:46.231,Thank you very much.
01:14:51.528,01:14:54.281,"I like you a lot, but..."
01:14:55.407,01:14:57.117,I don't love you.
01:15:03.081,01:15:06.668,"That was haunting. Yeah, I felt that that was haunting..."
01:15:07.294,01:15:09.087,to just go and recreate that.
01:15:10.422,01:15:20.849,"You know, where he just made one thing after another, after another, and he didn't stop until they were completely blown away and had the most incredible night of their lives."
01:15:20.933,01:15:23.018,They knew they were part of something special.
01:15:28.899,01:15:31.527,It's the Mormon Tabernacle Choir!
01:15:37.783,01:15:39.201,It's the Rockettes!
01:15:40.285,01:15:41.620,I can't believe it!
01:15:45.874,01:15:47.501,It's Santa Claus!
01:15:57.844,01:16:01.056,For him to take everyone to that place...
01:16:01.807,01:16:07.854,"while at the same time he knows there's something going on that he's got to face that is, uh..."
01:16:08.730,01:16:10.065,absolutely terrifying.
01:16:14.736,01:16:17.864,So do you think Andy could tell us why you got us here?
01:16:21.201,01:16:22.035,I....
01:16:23.161,01:16:24.371,I have cancer.
01:16:26.415,01:16:28.000,Forget it!
01:16:28.333,01:16:29.459,Forget it!
01:16:29.543,01:16:33.463,"No, this is in such poor taste. I don't want anything to do with this!"
01:16:36.883,01:16:37.718,Guys...
01:16:37.801,01:16:38.635,That's funny...
01:16:39.678,01:16:42.139,"but it's not a gag, Bob."
01:16:42.222,01:16:44.474,I got cancer. I got lung cancer.
01:16:52.566,01:16:53.567,Andy...
01:16:53.984,01:16:57.362,look in my eye and tell me this is true.
01:17:01.658,01:17:03.910,-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -Hey.
01:17:03.994,01:17:04.911,I'm sorry.
01:17:06.163,01:17:06.997,Lynne?
01:17:07.497,01:17:08.749,"Come on, hey."
01:17:08.832,01:17:09.791,"Hey, hey."
01:17:18.258,01:17:20.052,This is a good song for today.
01:17:32.606,01:17:44.368,"exist so completely in their character, and maybe not know how to get out of it, or how to take another road might take the ultimate road, you know?"
01:17:44.451,01:17:47.287,"Where they, uh... they have to actually leave the, uh..."
01:17:48.038,01:17:48.997,the planet.
01:17:49.873,01:17:51.124,"You know, to get out."
01:17:56.588,01:17:59.341,All we really yearn for is our own absence.
01:18:01.385,01:18:03.428,"After all, you know?"
01:18:04.054,01:18:06.223,We yearn for what happens at death.
01:18:09.059,01:18:11.061,I don't have to worry about that anymore?
01:18:21.113,01:18:23.240,"I truly, uh, feel like, uh..."
01:18:23.323,01:18:37.713,"like if you ask me where I live right now, where the real me is, I would say that there's a quiet, gentle seat in the universe that seems to..."
01:18:39.548,01:18:42.592,"contain everything, and that's where I am."
01:18:44.386,01:18:52.227,"I don't want anything. That's the craziest thing, and it's the weirdest thing to say in a place like America, where I have no ambition."
01:18:53.270,01:18:54.938,"I really, truly don't."
01:18:55.397,01:18:56.606,How are you feeling?
01:18:57.190,01:18:59.609,"I'm doing fine, Andy."
01:19:05.657,01:19:07.075,I don't have to go anywhere.
01:19:09.369,01:19:13.165,"That's fascinating to me now, the disappearing."
01:19:14.750,01:19:17.085,You opened my eyes to so many things...
01:19:18.211,01:19:20.172,I never believed I'd ever see.
01:19:24.593,01:19:27.471,starting out and trying to make it definitely had...
01:19:27.554,01:19:29.222,-Yeah. -...had a different thing.
01:19:29.306,01:19:31.308,So where did that transition take place?
01:19:32.350,01:19:33.185,Uh...
01:19:34.436,01:19:37.439,Somewhere in the middle of...
01:19:38.398,01:19:46.573,"absolute confusion, absolute disappointment, absolute, uh..."
01:19:47.824,01:19:48.658,uh...
01:19:50.285,01:20:00.921,"the fruition of all of my dreams, uh, standing there with everything anybody else had ever dreamed about having, and being unhappy."
01:20:26.530,01:20:38.667,"and everybody was so in love with Andy at that point that they were truly saddened, you know, and he was reduced to this little glow."
01:20:39.209,01:20:47.259,"In my mind, he was this little glow, this divine spark who's slowly going out."
01:22:14.512,01:22:16.514,if you hadn't played Andy?
01:22:17.891,01:22:21.394,"Uh, well, no. Butterfly effect, man, you know."
01:22:21.937,01:22:24.147,Would've been somewhere completely different.
01:22:25.106,01:22:25.982,Uh...
01:22:27.359,01:22:29.361,"But the choices make you, you know."
01:22:29.444,01:22:32.364,"I'm not a big believer in free will either, so..."
01:22:32.906,01:22:33.740,um...
01:22:34.449,01:22:36.868,"You know, I pick up the tea because I'm thirsty."
01:22:37.786,01:22:39.955,"Is that free will, you know?"
01:22:41.957,01:22:42.999,Or am I thirsty?
01:22:43.500,01:22:45.835,"You know, what told me to pick up the tea?"
01:22:54.552,01:22:55.428,Okay.
01:23:08.191,01:23:10.235,and Andy did what Andy does.
01:23:10.735,01:23:14.781,"And Andy turned it upside down, and it still got made."
01:23:19.035,01:23:25.959,"It was-- it was a joyful, loving experience for everybody, and the evidence was right there on the last day."
01:23:26.042,01:23:30.880,"Everybody with a bag on their head, and everybody crying, people crying."
01:23:42.183,01:23:44.269,I want to thank everybody for this.
01:23:50.483,01:23:52.485,I just want to say that...
01:23:53.862,01:23:58.116,"although I never liked him, Andy Kaufman was a brilliant man."
01:24:00.035,01:24:00.869,And...
01:24:01.619,01:24:07.667,"And he changed a lot of things, and opened a lot of doors for a lot of people in their lives."
01:24:08.084,01:24:09.210,And I'm honored...
01:24:11.296,01:24:12.589,to be part of this.
01:24:15.133,01:24:18.928,And we should all thank our lucky stars that Andy Kaufman walked this earth.
01:24:40.700,01:24:41.951,Cheers!
01:24:48.958,01:24:51.086,-After spending time with him? -No.
01:24:51.169,01:24:52.420,-In that period? -No.
01:24:53.338,01:24:54.672,I don't miss anything.
01:25:08.228,01:25:11.523,that I wasn't in the REM video.
01:25:14.859,01:25:19.531,"At that time, I just didn't want to be Andy anymore."
01:25:20.406,01:25:26.788,"And they wanted me to be Andy in the video, and I just didn't want to go back once I left Andy."
01:25:27.455,01:25:31.459,And I tried to figure out what the hell I am again.
01:25:31.918,01:25:34.671,I just didn't want to go back and be Andy anymore.
01:25:37.715,01:25:39.634,"Jim Carrey, Man on the Moon."
01:25:43.346,01:25:44.347,Hello!
01:25:52.147,01:25:58.695,"It probably means different things to Michael Stipe, but to me, Andy was the great beyond."
01:26:04.159,01:26:07.120,I didn't know who I was anymore when the movie was over.
01:26:07.704,01:26:13.751,I didn't know what my politics were. I couldn't remember what I was about.
01:26:17.338,01:26:23.344,"Suddenly I was so unhappy, and I realized that I was back in my problems."
01:26:23.887,01:26:26.806,I was back in my heartbreak.
01:26:28.641,01:26:32.770,"And suddenly I thought to myself, You felt so good when you were being Andy."
01:26:34.314,01:26:36.399,'Cause you were free from yourself.
01:26:36.482,01:26:38.484,You were on vacation from Jim Carrey.
01:26:39.152,01:26:44.574,"You stepped through the door not knowing what's on the other side, and what's on the other side is everything."
01:26:45.074,01:26:46.367,"You know, everything."
01:26:48.161,01:27:04.636,"There's a feeling of relief from this vehicle that's traveling through space, trying to, like, grasp onto stuff, like fucking countries, and religions, and..."
01:27:05.178,01:27:06.179,uh...
01:27:06.554,01:27:09.182,And I find it all so abstract.
01:27:09.599,01:27:11.017,Why am I an American?
01:27:11.392,01:27:12.727,Why am I a Canadian?
01:27:12.810,01:27:14.604,What is that? What does that mean?
01:27:14.687,01:27:19.108,"Somebody put a line down and said, This is that. You know, uh..."
01:27:20.151,01:27:21.736,"You know, we're so much more."
01:27:22.362,01:27:28.076,"Then we, like, are born into a family, so we're told what our family name is."
01:27:28.159,01:27:32.664,"And then your parents choose a name, and they say, Your name will be Joel."
01:27:32.747,01:27:34.707,It means the...
01:27:35.792,01:27:39.003,"awesomeness of Yahweh, you know."
01:27:39.087,01:27:45.718,"And you have to live up to that, dude, and, uh, we're counting on you not to make us look bad."
01:27:46.094,01:27:55.144,"And you're gonna go to Harvard, and you're gonna be a doctor, and you're gonna be-- And by the way, you're a Catholic, or you're a Jew, or you're, you know, whatever you are."
01:27:55.228,01:27:58.147,It's like everything is so...
01:27:58.898,01:28:06.656,"are these abstract structures that you're given, and it's supposed to hold you together somehow, you know."
01:28:06.739,01:28:08.783,"And I've just given 'em up, you know."
01:28:08.866,01:28:10.868,I don't need to be held together.
01:28:10.952,01:28:15.665,I'm fine just floating through space like Andy.
01:28:16.374,01:28:17.625,"You know, just..."
01:28:20.086,01:28:23.589,"flying 6,000 miles an hour around the sun."
01:28:24.173,01:28:25.008,You know.
01:28:25.550,01:28:29.512,Balancing on tectonic plates that are floating on lava.
01:28:30.054,01:28:36.686,"You know, ready for the end times to occur and whatever the hell is gonna happen."
01:28:37.228,01:28:38.354,I'm just great.
01:28:38.438,01:28:40.940,That's all great. That's all great.
01:28:45.403,01:28:52.493,"You're on a spiritual journey, period, and we're all gonna end up in the same place, if there is such a thing."
01:28:52.994,01:28:56.080,And maybe there isn't. Maybe there's just this and that's it.
01:28:56.164,01:28:58.207,"There's me and the teacup, that's it."
01:28:58.291,01:29:00.668,"There's us. We're the universe, man."
01:29:02.295,01:29:03.796,"I like that, that's fine."
01:29:04.464,01:29:05.298,Yeah.
01:29:06.174,01:29:07.008,So...
01:29:07.592,01:29:08.426,uh...
01:29:09.886,01:29:12.472,Yeah. I don't know what else to say about all this.
01:29:12.847,01:29:15.141,"Yeah, I think I'm tapped out."
01:29:19.687,01:29:20.521,I wonder...
01:29:20.897,01:29:23.274,I wonder if I could do that with other people?
01:29:23.358,01:29:28.112,I wonder what would happen if I decided to just be Jesus?
01:29:34.786,01:29:36.996,"Wow, we got into some crazy shit down there."
01:30:33.219,01:30:36.305,I don't care if Jim Carrey wants to jack off all day long.
01:30:37.306,01:30:39.225,He can fucking do whatever he wants.
01:30:39.308,01:30:44.272,"It's our movie, it's our set, it's our concept, and you're giving this stuff over."
01:30:44.564,01:30:48.109,But you would then say you would not give your release to the use of yourself.
01:30:48.776,01:30:51.154,"Just if-- I mean, unless you're putting me on."
01:30:52.321,01:30:53.739,"Oh, you're so full of shit."
01:30:58.202,01:31:00.872,How does it feel? How does it feel?
01:31:01.914,01:31:03.708,The shoe is on the other foot!
01:31:04.333,01:31:05.877,Fuck you! Fuck you too!
01:31:34.071,01:31:37.325,"Thank you very much, you've been a fantastic audience!"
01:33:35.192,01:33:36.402,Thank you very much!
01:33:37.778,01:33:40.114,Thank you. I do all my own stunts.
