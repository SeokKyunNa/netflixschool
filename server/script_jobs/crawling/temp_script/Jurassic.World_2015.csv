00:02:26.563,00:02:30.024,How many minutes to get your little butt in the van? Hmm?
00:02:30.984,00:02:32.026,How many of those?
00:02:33.027,00:02:34.863,-Feed the monster under your bed? -Yes.
00:02:38.158,00:02:42.245,"Call me every day, and text me pics so I don't forget what you look like."
00:02:42.745,00:02:44.330,I'm only gonna be gone a week.
00:02:44.414,00:02:47.417,Zach. You're not going off to war here.

00:03:13.026,00:03:16.362,I'm so jealous. You're gonna have so much fun!
00:03:16.654,00:03:18.740,-I love you. -I love you too.
00:03:25.955,00:03:27.540,"Okay, right."
00:03:27.624,00:03:30.710,"All right, um, let's give these to your brother. Okay?"
00:03:31.461,00:03:32.503,"You hold these, please."
00:03:32.879,00:03:35.298,"Can you hold these? Honey, I need you to take care of these."
00:03:35.381,00:03:36.716,-Yeah. -Hey.
00:03:37.217,00:03:38.384,-Alright. -Listen to your mother.
00:03:41.012,00:03:43.014,I'm serious. It's the green button.
00:03:43.097,00:03:45.058,"When you see my name, push it. Okay?"
00:03:45.266,00:03:48.853,"And remember, something chases you, run."
00:03:50.355,00:03:52.565,"-Come on! Alright. -Ah, you're funny."
00:03:52.649,00:03:54.150,"-Okay, let's go. Come on. -Bye, guys."
00:03:54.442,00:03:56.027,-Bye. -I miss you already!
00:03:56.277,00:03:57.320,Yeah.
00:03:59.072,00:04:01.074,So much for our last family breakfast.
00:04:02.700,00:04:04.285,Why do you have to say things like that?
00:04:06.204,00:04:07.580,Did you call your sister?
00:04:08.748,00:04:09.958,Straight to voice mail.
00:04:10.833,00:04:14.087,"It'll be fine. She handles 20,000 people a day, right?"
00:04:14.837,00:04:16.381,She can handle two more.
00:04:22.637,00:04:25.306,-Big. -But how many pounds?
00:04:26.057,00:04:27.267,Doesn't make sense.
00:04:33.064,00:04:36.109,Now they have 14 herbivores and six carnivores.
00:04:36.192,00:04:37.777,"That's, like, 50 tons of food a week."

00:05:31.080,00:05:35.084,"Okay, those of you in the front of the train should be able to see our main gates."
00:05:35.168,00:05:40.339,Those were part of the original park over 20 years ago.
00:05:54.103,00:05:56.147,Your aunt arranged to greet you at 1:00.
00:05:56.230,00:05:58.691,-Can he slow down? -Nope.
00:05:58.775,00:06:00.359,Come on!
00:06:06.699,00:06:10.745,"Your aunt's got you VIP access, so you can get on all the rides without waiting in line."
00:06:10.828,00:06:13.289,"-Let's go! -Dude, she said we had to wait."
00:06:13.372,00:06:15.416,I don't wanna wait anymore!

00:07:09.679,00:07:12.849,"Our shareholders have been patient, but let's be honest."
00:07:13.182,00:07:15.977,No one's impressed by a dinosaur anymore.
00:07:16.394,00:07:19.272,"Twenty years ago, de-extinction was right up there with magic."
00:07:19.814,00:07:23.818,"These days, kids look at a stegosaurus like an elephant from the city zoo."
00:07:24.277,00:07:26.863,That doesn't mean Asset Development is falling behind.

00:07:30.658,00:07:34.287,"But consumers want them bigger, louder."
00:07:34.370,00:07:35.204,More teeth.
00:07:36.164,00:07:37.206,The good news?
00:07:37.290,00:07:40.460,Our advances in gene splicing have opened up a whole new frontier.
00:07:42.044,00:07:47.258,We've learned more from genetics in the past decade… than a century of digging up bones.
00:07:47.675,00:07:53.973,"So, when you say you want to sponsor an attraction, what do you have in mind?"
00:07:55.725,00:07:57.018,We want to be thrilled.
00:07:57.852,00:07:58.811,Don't we all?
00:08:03.107,00:08:04.066,The Indominus rex.
00:08:04.442,00:08:06.986,Our first genetically modified hybrid.
00:08:07.778,00:08:13.493,"How did you get two different kinds of dinosaurs to, you know-- Oh, Indominus wasn't bred."
00:08:14.118,00:08:15.661,She was designed.
00:08:16.245,00:08:18.789,She will be 50 feet long when fully grown.
00:08:19.832,00:08:21.042,Bigger than the T. rex.
00:08:21.292,00:08:25.004,"Every time we've unveiled a new asset, attendance has spiked."

00:08:34.180,00:08:35.973,She already is.
00:08:53.407,00:08:55.451,"-Come on. -Dude, chill."

00:09:42.331,00:09:44.834,Don't wander off. Mom's not paying me for babysitting.
00:09:44.917,00:09:48.546,-The building blocks of life. -Gray! Is that you?
00:09:48.838,00:09:49.755,Aunt Claire!
00:09:50.464,00:09:52.049,"Okay, I'm gonna have to go. My nephews are here."
00:09:53.384,00:09:54.385,Hi!
00:09:54.468,00:09:56.053,Oh!
00:09:56.137,00:09:59.265,"Oh, my gosh, you're so-- you're so sweet."
00:09:59.348,00:10:01.601,Whoa. Zach.
00:10:01.684,00:10:06.772,"Last time I saw you, you were, like-- That must have been, what? Three, four years ago?"
00:10:06.856,00:10:09.567,"Uh, seven. Seven years. But, you know, close."
00:10:11.360,00:10:13.738,So I see you already got your wristbands.
00:10:13.821,00:10:15.906,And this is for food.
00:10:15.990,00:10:20.244,And Zara here is going to take great care of you until I'm done working tonight. Okay?
00:10:20.786,00:10:21.662,You're not coming with us?
00:10:22.622,00:10:31.130,"Oh, I-- I really wish that I could, but, um-- Tomorrow, I can take you into the control room, show you behind the scenes and all of that."
00:10:31.213,00:10:33.799,"That-- That's-- That's gonna be cool, right?"
00:10:36.052,00:10:40.890,"Okay, so, um, I will see you tonight, at, uh, 6:00."
00:10:40.973,00:10:42.892,"-No, no, don't forget you have the-- -Right. Of course."
00:10:42.975,00:10:46.020,I will see you tonight at 8:00. What time do you go to sleep?
00:10:46.354,00:10:49.190,Or do you go to sleep at different times?
00:10:51.275,00:10:53.944,"Okay, so, um, have fun."
00:10:57.490,00:10:59.450,"Yeah. No, I'm here."
00:11:05.706,00:11:06.749,They're going at it again.
00:11:06.832,00:11:09.585,"Should I tranq them, or are you coming over to take care of this?"
00:11:12.254,00:11:14.006,What's the live count?
00:11:14.090,00:11:15.758,"22,216."
00:11:15.841,00:11:19.345,"-Any incidents? -Yeah, six kids in the lost-and-found."
00:11:19.428,00:11:22.807,"-Uh, 28 down with heatstroke-- -Where did you get that?"
00:11:23.599,00:11:27.019,"Oh, this? I got it on eBay. Yeah, it's pretty amazing."
00:11:27.103,00:11:32.650,"I got it for $150, but the mint condition one goes for 300, eas-- Didn't occur to you maybe that's in poor taste?"
00:11:32.733,00:11:36.153,"The shirt? Y-Yeah, it did. I understand people died. It was terrible."
00:11:36.237,00:11:39.657,But… that first park was legit.
00:11:39.740,00:11:41.158,"You know, I-I have a lot of respect for it."
00:11:41.242,00:11:44.745,They didn't need these genetic hybrids. They just needed real dinosaurs.
00:11:44.829,00:11:48.124,"-Okay, please don't wear it again. -Yeah. Wasn't gonna."
00:11:48.207,00:11:49.917,-Did you close the deal? -Looks like it.
00:11:50.000,00:11:53.462,Verizon Wireless presents the Indominus rex.
00:11:56.257,00:12:00.845,"Why not just go the distance, and just let these corporations name the dinosaurs?"
00:12:00.928,00:12:02.888,They've got all the ballparks. Why stop there?
00:12:02.972,00:12:06.934,-Why are the west plains closed? -Another pachy roaming outside his zone.
00:12:07.017,00:12:08.894,But he's fully sedated and ready for relocation.
00:12:08.978,00:12:10.980,Pepsi-saurs. Tostito-don.
00:12:11.063,00:12:13.149,Security said the invisible fences were a no-fail.
00:12:13.232,00:12:14.900,That is the second time this month.
00:12:18.112,00:12:20.281,How much longer until they get it out of there?
00:12:20.364,00:12:22.867,He just got five milligrams of carfentanil.
00:12:22.950,00:12:27.079,"Yes, he's very stoned. So why don't we show a little sympathy?"
00:12:27.538,00:12:30.416,"I mean, you do understand these are actual animals, right?"
00:12:30.499,00:12:32.293,Clean up your work space.
00:12:32.376,00:12:34.837,It's… chaotic.
00:12:35.588,00:12:38.382,I like to think of it as a living system.
00:12:38.466,00:12:42.928,Just enough stability to keep it from collapsing into anarchy.
00:12:51.520,00:12:53.230,"ETA, five minutes."
00:13:17.004,00:13:17.838,Claire.
00:13:18.714,00:13:21.550,Mr. Masrani. You are flying.
00:13:21.634,00:13:23.219,I got my license.
00:13:23.302,00:13:25.763,"-Two more. -Yeah, two more days."
00:13:25.846,00:13:28.182,"-Okay. -So, how's my park doing?"
00:13:29.099,00:13:31.435,Great. We're up two and a half percent over last year.
00:13:31.519,00:13:36.398,"A bit lower than our initial projection-- No, no, no, no. How is it doing? Are the guests having fun?"
00:13:36.482,00:13:38.067,Are the animals enjoying life?
00:13:38.150,00:13:41.695,"Well, guest satisfaction is steady in the low 90s."
00:13:41.779,00:13:46.325,We don't have a way to measure the animals' emotional experience.
00:13:46.408,00:13:48.994,Sure you do. You can see in their eyes.
00:13:51.997,00:13:53.165,Okay.
00:13:53.249,00:13:55.876,Now show me my new dinosaur.
00:14:06.554,00:14:08.222,Got it.
00:14:23.070,00:14:24.029,"You look tense, Claire."
00:14:25.573,00:14:28.617,Maybe you should just focus on the controls.
00:14:29.076,00:14:33.789,The key to a happy life is to accept you are never actually in control.
00:14:33.873,00:14:34.707,Bird!
00:14:39.169,00:14:42.339,You should spend a day at the beach. Get some sun.
00:14:42.423,00:14:43.632,"Uh, right."
00:14:43.716,00:14:50.014,"So, marketing thought we could offset some of the costs by selling-- Enough about cost!"
00:14:50.097,00:14:54.310,"John Hammond entrusted me with his dying wish, and not once did he mention profits."
00:14:54.393,00:14:56.604,"Spare no expense, he used to say."
00:14:56.687,00:15:03.402,"I appreciate that, but, um, the reality of operating a theme park requires-- Don't forget why we built this place, Claire."
00:15:03.485,00:15:07.698,"Jurassic World exists to remind us how very small we are, how new."
00:15:08.115,00:15:09.700,You can't put a price on that.
00:15:09.783,00:15:13.203,"Now, please. We're flying."
00:15:14.413,00:15:16.165,Breathe.
00:15:44.735,00:15:47.237,"-Are you okay? -Oh, he's jus being dramatic."
00:15:48.155,00:15:50.199,Are you still building?
00:15:50.282,00:15:56.121,"We planned to open in May, but Asset Containment insisted we build the walls up higher."
00:15:56.205,00:15:58.290,It's bigger than expected.
00:16:04.171,00:16:05.673,It's a good sign.
00:16:07.841,00:16:10.636,We hit a few speed bumps early on.
00:16:10.719,00:16:13.931,It began to anticipate where the food would come from.
00:16:14.014,00:16:15.849,One of the handlers nearly lost an arm.
00:16:15.933,00:16:19.979,The others threatened to quit if I couldn't guarantee their safety.
00:16:20.938,00:16:22.439,So she's intelligent then.
00:16:22.523,00:16:24.316,For a dinosaur.
00:16:25.067,00:16:26.443,And that?
00:16:31.323,00:16:32.574,It tried to break the glass.
00:16:33.867,00:16:35.494,I like her spirit.
00:16:57.433,00:16:58.225,"Oh, it's white."
00:16:59.435,00:17:00.686,You never told me it was white.
00:17:06.400,00:17:08.277,Think it'll scare the kids?
00:17:09.737,00:17:10.738,The kids?
00:17:12.114,00:17:14.241,This'll give the parents nightmares.
00:17:15.951,00:17:17.369,Is that good?
00:17:19.204,00:17:21.457,It's fantastic.
00:17:25.502,00:17:26.920,Can she see us?
00:17:28.005,00:17:31.383,"They say it can sense thermal radiation, like snakes."
00:17:32.551,00:17:34.553,I thought there were two of them.
00:17:35.012,00:17:38.432,"There was a sibling, in case this one didn't survive infancy."
00:17:38.515,00:17:39.767,Where's the sibling?
00:17:40.517,00:17:41.393,She ate it.
00:17:49.610,00:17:52.654,So… the paddock is quite safe then?
00:17:53.655,00:17:57.284,We have the best structural engineers in the world.
00:17:58.243,00:17:59.119,"Yeah, so did Hammond."
00:18:01.997,00:18:04.208,There's an American navy man here.
00:18:04.291,00:18:07.419,Part of a research program one of my companies is running.
00:18:07.503,00:18:09.088,Owen Grady.
00:18:10.255,00:18:11.465,I know who he is.
00:18:11.548,00:18:14.718,His animals often try to escape. They're smart.
00:18:15.511,00:18:16.428,He has to be smarter.
00:18:16.512,00:18:18.180,He only thinks he's smarter.
00:18:20.057,00:18:21.725,I want you to bring him in.
00:18:22.684,00:18:23.811,Let him inspect the paddock.
00:18:25.604,00:18:27.606,Maybe he sees something we can't.
00:19:00.889,00:19:01.682,Eyes on me.
00:19:02.558,00:19:03.225,Blue.
00:19:06.103,00:19:07.062,Watch it.
00:19:07.813,00:19:10.399,"Charlie, do-- Hey! Don't give me that shit!"
00:19:11.441,00:19:13.610,Delta! Lock it up!
00:19:16.780,00:19:18.949,And… we're moving!
00:19:25.956,00:19:27.249,Hold!
00:19:28.667,00:19:29.501,"Hey, that's good."
00:19:32.921,00:19:34.006,Very good!
00:19:34.089,00:19:36.300,"See, Charlie? That's what you get!"
00:19:37.134,00:19:39.136,"Echo, there you go! Delta!"
00:19:41.805,00:19:42.890,Blue?
00:19:45.851,00:19:46.935,This one's for you.
00:19:50.647,00:19:51.899,Hold!
00:19:52.983,00:19:54.526,Eyes up!
00:19:57.362,00:19:58.488,Go.
00:20:05.412,00:20:06.788,"You finally did it, man."
00:20:10.918,00:20:14.755,"I was starting to think I hired the wrong guys, but, damn, you got 'em eating out of your palm."
00:20:15.297,00:20:17.049,You came on a good day. It's not usually a happy ending.
00:20:17.132,00:20:19.468,That why you're not sending in your reports?
00:20:19.551,00:20:23.013,-We've been busy. -Not too busy to cash your paychecks.
00:20:23.972,00:20:25.015,"Uh, what do you need, buddy?"
00:20:26.058,00:20:26.975,A field test.
00:20:28.435,00:20:29.353,Hey.
00:20:29.436,00:20:31.772,I've just seen they can respond to commands.
00:20:31.855,00:20:34.483,We need to take the research and get it on its feet.
00:20:34.566,00:20:37.569,"They're wild animals, Hoskins. Trust me. You don't want 'em in the field."
00:20:37.653,00:20:42.658,"I just saw a bond, a real bond, between man and beast."
00:20:42.741,00:20:45.285,-You're in my way. -Come on. We're the same.
00:20:45.369,00:20:46.787,We're dogs of war.
00:20:47.329,00:20:49.998,We know that the military needs to reduce casualties.
00:20:50.082,00:20:52.501,Some people think that robots are the future.
00:20:52.584,00:20:59.675,"Look, nature gave us the most effective killing machines 75 million years ago, and now we know they can take orders."
00:21:00.425,00:21:04.388,"We finally make progress, and that's the first thing he says? Make a weapon?"
00:21:06.056,00:21:07.224,"Come on, gents."
00:21:07.933,00:21:09.518,It's grown-up time.
00:21:09.601,00:21:12.145,Drones can't search tunnels and caves.
00:21:12.229,00:21:13.272,And they're hackable.
00:21:13.355,00:21:16.817,"The minute a real war breaks out, all that fancy tech is gonna go dark."
00:21:17.276,00:21:19.987,"Yeah, but that tech's not gonna eat them if they forget to feed it."
00:21:20.070,00:21:22.531,Look. Look at these creatures.
00:21:22.614,00:21:27.244,"They've got millions of years of instinct in their cells, instinct that we can program."
00:21:28.036,00:21:30.247,Their loyalty cannot be bought.
00:21:31.290,00:21:35.794,"These guys are gonna run straight into the enemy's teeth… and eat 'em, belt buckle and all."
00:21:36.795,00:21:39.506,What if they decide they wanna be in control?
00:21:39.589,00:21:42.342,"Well, then we remind 'em who is. We terminate the rogues."
00:21:42.426,00:21:44.303,Promote only loyal bloodlines.
00:21:51.685,00:21:55.647,You come here and you don't learn anything about these animals… except what you want to know.
00:21:57.316,00:21:59.109,"You made them, and now you think you own them."
00:22:00.027,00:22:01.069,We do own them.
00:22:02.487,00:22:04.031,Extinct animals have no rights.
00:22:05.073,00:22:07.576,"-They're not extinct anymore, Hoskins. -Exactly."
00:22:08.327,00:22:09.953,We're sitting on a gold mine.
00:22:10.037,00:22:13.123,And Masrani is using it to stock a petting zoo.
00:22:16.460,00:22:23.300,"You think that the eighth richest man in the world… is only into oil, telecom and family fun parks?"
00:22:23.383,00:22:25.552,"He's so diversified, he doesn't even know what he owns."
00:22:25.635,00:22:27.804,How long has InGen been practicing this pitch?
00:22:27.888,00:22:31.808,Since the day we hired you out of the navy. You knew the endgame.
00:22:31.892,00:22:35.771,These animals can replace thousands of boots on the ground.
00:22:35.854,00:22:37.773,How many lives would that save?
00:22:40.400,00:22:41.568,War is part of nature.
00:22:43.487,00:22:45.072,"Look around, Owen."
00:22:45.155,00:22:48.784,Every living thing in this jungle is trying to murder the other.
00:22:49.743,00:22:54.539,"Mother Nature's way of testing her creations, refining the pecking order."
00:22:54.623,00:22:57.709,War is a struggle. Struggle breeds greatness.
00:22:58.960,00:23:03.006,"Without that, we end up with places like this, charge seven bucks a soda."
00:23:04.549,00:23:06.259,Do you hear yourself when you talk?
00:23:09.971,00:23:13.642,"This is gonna happen, with or without you boys."
00:23:14.309,00:23:15.435,"Progress always wins, man."
00:23:16.353,00:23:18.230,Maybe progress should lose for once.
00:23:42.087,00:23:43.755,"Owen, no!"
00:23:46.466,00:23:48.176,"No, no! Hold your fire!"
00:23:49.928,00:23:52.347,Hold your fire! Do not fire!
00:23:54.516,00:23:57.310,"Put 12 amps in these animals, they're never gonna trust me again."
00:23:59.479,00:24:02.649,Blue. Stand down.
00:24:03.984,00:24:05.068,Stand down.
00:24:06.069,00:24:08.572,"Hey, hey! What did I just say?"
00:24:09.698,00:24:12.159,Delta! I see you. Back up!
00:24:14.661,00:24:16.830,Okay. Good.
00:24:19.541,00:24:20.750,Charlie!
00:24:22.377,00:24:23.545,Stay right there.
00:24:25.213,00:24:26.464,Good.
00:24:28.383,00:24:31.511,-Close the gate. -Are you crazy?
00:24:31.595,00:24:33.722,-Just trust me. -Close the gate!
00:24:36.516,00:24:37.767,Merde.
00:24:50.739,00:24:52.908,-T'aurais dû l'laisser l'bouffer. -Yeah.
00:24:58.788,00:24:59.706,"You're the new guy, right?"
00:25:00.874,00:25:02.000,Yeah.
00:25:02.083,00:25:03.919,You ever wonder why there was a job opening?
00:25:06.379,00:25:08.673,"Hey, don't ever turn your back to the cage."
00:25:53.885,00:25:55.553,Lift me up. I can't see!
00:25:56.221,00:25:58.640,I'm not Dad. And you're not five.
00:25:58.723,00:26:00.600,I can still ride the Triceratops.
00:26:00.684,00:26:02.519,I'm 47 and a half inches.
00:26:02.602,00:26:04.896,This place is for little kids.
00:26:05.981,00:26:08.275,"Yeah, I know. Wanna go on the spinning dinosaur eggs?"
00:26:08.358,00:26:09.192,Nope.
00:26:10.443,00:26:11.695,"Hey, cover up your dork pouch."
00:26:12.988,00:26:16.449,"Because it's my wedding. No, Alec's not having a bachelor party."
00:26:16.533,00:26:18.285,'Cause all his friends are animals.
00:26:18.910,00:26:20.287,-Scatter. -What?
00:26:20.370,00:26:21.913,"Go. Run. Go, go, go, go!"
00:26:45.061,00:26:47.188,-T. rex! Come on! -Okay!
00:26:47.272,00:26:48.606,Let's go!
00:26:50.191,00:26:52.652,this show may be disturbing for smaller children.
00:27:04.831,00:27:06.041,"Hey, Mom."
00:27:06.124,00:27:08.918,You were supposed to call me when you landed.
00:27:09.002,00:27:12.172,"-Are you having fun? -Yeah, uh, I guess."
00:27:13.715,00:27:16.676,Aunt Claire gave us passes so we don't have to wait in line.
00:27:16.760,00:27:18.219,"Wait, she's not with you?"
00:27:24.392,00:27:25.352,"Hey, Karen."
00:27:25.435,00:27:28.063,"Hi, Claire. How's it going?"
00:27:28.146,00:27:32.942,"Yeah, everything's great. The boys are having fun. Everyone's-- Yeah, everyone's good."
00:27:33.026,00:27:36.363,"Really? 'Cause I just hung up with Zach, and he said that you weren't even with them."
00:27:37.989,00:27:39.115,"Yeah, look."
00:27:39.199,00:27:41.951,Today turned out to be a really bad day for me.
00:27:42.035,00:27:44.329,"Um, they're in great hands."
00:27:44.954,00:27:53.588,"They're with my assistant. She's British, so-- Wait, are you crying?"
00:27:55.131,00:27:57.926,"This was supposed to be a family weekend, Claire."
00:27:58.009,00:28:00.011,You haven't seen the boys in forever.
00:28:00.095,00:28:02.138,And I know how Zach'll treat Gray if they're by themselves.
00:28:02.222,00:28:09.771,"-He can just be so mean. -Okay, I-- I'm sorry, uh-- Tomorrow, I'm gonna spend the entire day with them."
00:28:09.854,00:28:12.899,I'm going to take off work and I will not leave their side. I promise.
00:28:13.400,00:28:17.070,"Yeah. Well, a promise tomorrow is worth a lot less than trying today."
00:28:17.153,00:28:19.989,Ugh. You're using Mom's lines now?
00:28:20.073,00:28:22.617,"Oh, my God. I am using Mom's lines."
00:28:22.700,00:28:24.494,"I'm sorry, but, you know, I have to tell you they work."
00:28:24.577,00:28:26.246,You'll see when you have kids.
00:28:26.329,00:28:28.832,"-Yeah, if. -When."
00:28:30.166,00:28:32.752,"-It's worth it. -Bye, Mom."
00:28:35.797,00:28:36.756,Bye.
00:28:54.065,00:28:55.567,What do they want now?
00:28:55.650,00:28:56.985,Mr. Grady?
00:28:58.111,00:29:01.740,I need you to come take a look at something.
00:29:03.533,00:29:05.243,Why are you calling me Mr. Grady?
00:29:08.788,00:29:10.999,-If you're not too busy. -I'm pretty busy.
00:29:11.541,00:29:12.667,We have an attraction.
00:29:12.751,00:29:14.753,That's not what you said the last time I saw you.
00:29:14.836,00:29:17.881,"-talking about the dinosaurs, Mr. Grady. -Owen."
00:29:24.012,00:29:26.306,You just went and made a new dinosaur?
00:29:27.140,00:29:29.392,"Yeah. It's, uh, kinda what we do here."
00:29:30.268,00:29:32.145,The exhibit opens to the public in three weeks.
00:29:32.228,00:29:35.523,Mr. Masrani wanted me to consult with you.
00:29:36.316,00:29:40.320,You wanna consult here or… in my bungalow?
00:29:44.032,00:29:45.074,A little funny.
00:29:45.158,00:29:48.036,We'd like you to evaluate the paddock for vulnerabilities.
00:29:48.119,00:29:49.245,Why me?
00:29:50.497,00:29:57.962,I guess Mr. Masrani thinks… since you're able to control the raptors-- See? It's all about control with you.
00:29:58.046,00:30:00.924,I don't control the raptors. It's a relationship.
00:30:01.716,00:30:03.009,It's based on mutual respect.
00:30:04.969,00:30:06.846,That's why you and I never had a second date.
00:30:06.930,00:30:09.724,Excuse me. I never wanted a second date.
00:30:09.808,00:30:12.018,Who prints out an itinerary for a night out?
00:30:12.101,00:30:13.520,I'm an organized person.
00:30:13.603,00:30:16.397,And what kind of a diet doesn't allow tequila?
00:30:16.481,00:30:22.320,"-All of them, actually. -Well-- And what kind of a man shows up to a date in board shorts?"
00:30:22.403,00:30:24.489,"-It's Central America. It's hot. -Okay, okay."
00:30:24.572,00:30:27.534,"Can we just focus on the asset, please?"
00:30:27.617,00:30:28.952,The asset?
00:30:29.786,00:30:31.079,"Look, I get it."
00:30:32.121,00:30:34.374,You're in charge out here. You gotta make a lot of tough decisions.
00:30:34.457,00:30:38.169,It's probably easier to pretend these animals are just numbers on a spreadsheet.
00:30:38.253,00:30:40.880,But they're not. They're alive.
00:30:40.964,00:30:43.299,I'm fully aware they're alive.
00:30:43.842,00:30:46.427,"You might have made them in a test tube, but they don't know that."
00:30:46.511,00:30:57.856,"They're thinking, I gotta eat, I gotta hunt, I gotta-- You can relate to at least one of those things."
00:30:57.939,00:30:59.148,Right?
00:31:03.069,00:31:03.945,I'll be in the car.
00:31:07.949,00:31:10.076,You might want to change your shirt.
00:31:10.159,00:31:13.413,They're very sensitive to smell.
00:31:23.506,00:31:36.060,"The Mosasaurus was thought to have hunted near the surface of the water, where it preyed on anything it could sink its teeth into, including turtles, large fish, even smaller mosasaurs."
00:31:36.144,00:31:40.899,"Okay, folks, let's see if she's still hungry after already eating today."
00:31:40.982,00:31:45.653,"She's a little shy, so be nice and give her a hand when she comes out."
00:31:45.737,00:31:48.197,Zach. Zach! It's the Mosasaurus!
00:32:01.127,00:32:03.004,"Oh, my God! That was awesome!"
00:32:07.508,00:32:11.012,We're gonna give you an even closer look at our Mosasaurus.
00:32:29.405,00:32:31.824,"-Hey, you wanna see something else cool? -Yeah!"
00:32:42.335,00:32:47.298,The park needs a new attraction every few years… in order to reinvigorate the public's interest.
00:32:47.382,00:32:49.425,Kind of like the space program.
00:32:49.509,00:32:53.429,Corporate felt genetic modification would up the wow factor.
00:32:53.513,00:32:55.181,They're dinosaurs. Wow enough.
00:32:55.765,00:32:57.517,Not according to our focus groups.
00:32:58.101,00:32:59.936,The Indominus rex makes us relevant again.
00:33:02.397,00:33:05.358,We needed something scary and easy to pronounce.
00:33:05.441,00:33:08.945,You should hear a four-year-old try to say Archaeornithomimus.
00:33:09.570,00:33:10.989,You should hear you try to say it.
00:33:17.078,00:33:18.579,So what's this thing made of?
00:33:19.414,00:33:21.124,The base genome is a T. rex.
00:33:21.207,00:33:23.835,The rest is… classified.
00:33:24.210,00:33:26.796,"You made a new dinosaur, but you don't even know what it is?"
00:33:26.879,00:33:30.383,"The lab delivers us finished assets, and we show them to the public."
00:33:30.466,00:33:32.260,"Can we drop a steer, please?"
00:33:33.052,00:33:36.055,-How long has the animal been in here? -All its life.
00:33:36.597,00:33:38.933,Never seen anything outside of these walls?
00:33:39.017,00:33:40.852,We can't exactly walk it.
00:33:40.935,00:33:42.145,And you feed it with that?
00:33:47.316,00:33:48.735,Is there a problem?
00:33:49.152,00:33:52.155,Animals raised in isolation aren't always the most functional.
00:33:53.322,00:33:56.034,Your raptors are born in captivity.
00:33:56.117,00:33:57.410,With siblings.
00:33:57.493,00:33:59.454,They learn social skills.
00:33:59.537,00:34:02.540,And I imprint on them when they're born. There's trust.
00:34:02.623,00:34:06.461,The only positive relationship this animal has is with that crane.
00:34:07.962,00:34:09.630,At least she knows that means food.
00:34:10.214,00:34:12.258,So she needs a friend.
00:34:12.341,00:34:14.844,We should schedule play dates? That sort of thing?
00:34:16.512,00:34:17.805,Probably not a good idea.
00:34:21.642,00:34:24.520,"-Where is it? -Yeah, what, is it in the basement?"
00:34:24.604,00:34:27.732,Is there a downstairs? Maybe it's in the rec room.
00:34:28.357,00:34:30.318,It was just here. We were just here.
00:34:43.831,00:34:45.291,That doesn't make any sense.
00:34:47.835,00:34:49.670,These doors haven't been opened in weeks.
00:34:51.339,00:34:53.382,Were those claw marks always there?
00:34:59.097,00:35:05.353,"You think it-- Oh, God."
00:35:05.436,00:35:07.480,She has an implant in her back.
00:35:07.563,00:35:09.524,I can track it from the control room.
00:35:20.201,00:35:21.661,We have an asset out of containment.
00:35:21.744,00:35:24.247,Put ACU on alert. This is not a drill.
00:35:25.039,00:35:37.385,"Even though I didn't meet him until I was 13, I definitely consider Carl to be, like, more of a dad than my real dad, so-- -Yeah, hello? -Lowery."
00:35:37.468,00:35:39.137,Get me coordinates on the Indominus.
00:35:40.721,00:35:44.225,"Okay, yeah, uh-- I'm doing it right now."
00:36:10.501,00:36:12.211,You really think she could have climbed out?
00:36:13.462,00:36:14.380,Depends.
00:36:15.590,00:36:16.883,On what?
00:36:17.466,00:36:20.261,What kind of dinosaur they cooked up in that lab.
00:36:24.640,00:36:25.725,It's in the cage.
00:36:26.601,00:36:28.352,"No, that's impossible. I was just there."
00:36:28.436,00:36:30.938,"Claire, I'm telling you, she's in the cage."
00:36:32.190,00:36:34.817,W-Wait a sec. Wha-- There are people in there.
00:36:37.153,00:36:39.906,Get them out of there. Now. Now!
00:36:39.989,00:36:43.075,"Paddock 11, this is control. You need to evacuate the containment area."
00:36:46.078,00:36:48.289,"Paddock 11, do you copy?"
00:36:48.956,00:36:51.500,"-Yeah, what's the problem? -It's in the cage! It's in there with you!"
00:36:51.584,00:36:52.501,Go!
00:37:22.406,00:37:24.242,-Close the door. -We can't lock him in there!
00:37:24.325,00:37:27.745,-Come on. Close it now! -Somebody talk to me! What is happening?
00:37:29.914,00:37:30.957,Shit!
00:39:41.003,00:39:44.382,Everyone remain calm.
00:39:53.307,00:39:56.435,The implant will shock it if it gets too close to a perimeter fence.
00:39:56.519,00:39:58.312,"Okay, it's moving really fast."
00:39:58.396,00:40:00.272,This is control. Put out a park-wide alert.
00:40:00.356,00:40:01.607,"Hang up that damn phone, please."
00:40:02.400,00:40:04.568,Sorry. I'm getting new information. Everything's fine.
00:40:04.652,00:40:06.821,Let Asset Containment capture it quietly.
00:40:07.238,00:40:12.326,The very existence of this park… is predicated on our ability to handle incidents like this.
00:40:12.410,00:40:14.328,It was an eventuality. Okay?
00:40:14.412,00:40:16.205,You should put that in the brochure.
00:40:16.288,00:40:19.667,Eventually one of these things will eat somebody.
00:40:19.750,00:40:23.003,That paddock is four miles from the closest attraction.
00:40:23.087,00:40:27.091,ACU can handle this. No one else is gonna get-- Eaten?
00:40:34.014,00:40:36.642,This is a nonlethal operation. Understood?
00:40:39.812,00:40:42.064,Tout doux. Calme. Calme.
00:40:42.148,00:40:43.482,Tout doux. Tout doux.
00:40:45.943,00:40:48.696,Forty. Fifty when they're hungry.
00:40:48.779,00:40:49.613,Ooh!
00:40:50.823,00:40:52.783,"You ever open 'em up, see what they can do?"
00:40:53.909,00:40:55.035,No.
00:40:56.954,00:40:58.914,That got me! It got me.
00:40:59.874,00:41:01.917,What do you think? Wanna take one home?
00:41:02.001,00:41:03.043,"Hey, don't joke."
00:41:04.378,00:41:07.756,"When I was your age, I rescued a wolf pup."
00:41:09.592,00:41:11.927,It was two months old. It could barely walk.
00:41:13.095,00:41:15.681,"Used to sleep by my bed, watch over me."
00:41:17.683,00:41:20.394,"My wife, she came at me with a steak knife."
00:41:21.395,00:41:22.563,It took a chunk out of her arm.
00:41:23.439,00:41:24.148,You put him down?
00:41:27.985,00:41:30.779,"We had an unshakable bond, you know?"
00:41:31.530,00:41:35.618,"Just like you and, um-- What's his name?"
00:41:36.702,00:41:38.996,Delta. And she's a girl.
00:41:40.331,00:41:52.134,"Can I, uh-- Shh. Shh."
00:41:53.010,00:41:54.470,"Oh, wow."
00:42:00.726,00:42:01.268,Merde.
00:42:01.977,00:42:02.853,Code 19!
00:42:03.562,00:42:05.606,-That's the new one! -They're saying we lost two guys!
00:42:06.273,00:42:07.608,What's a code 19?
00:42:07.691,00:42:09.193,Asset out of containment.
00:42:10.236,00:42:12.112,"These people, they never learn."
00:42:14.240,00:42:17.326,They're gonna learn all kinds of things about their new asset now.
00:42:20.829,00:42:22.081,"Yeah, it's me."
00:42:23.082,00:42:24.542,We might have an opportunity here.
00:42:44.103,00:42:45.854,-You guys been here before? -Yeah.
00:42:47.982,00:42:51.235,"If Mom and Dad get divorced, will one of us be with Mom and the other with Dad?"
00:42:51.318,00:42:53.696,What? Why would you say that?
00:42:53.779,00:42:58.325,"-'Cause they are. -No, they're not getting div-- They're not getting divorced."
00:42:59.368,00:43:01.620,You haven't been around long enough. They've always been that way.
00:43:02.538,00:43:04.331,They get mail from two different lawyers.
00:43:04.415,00:43:05.708,That doesn't mean anything.
00:43:05.791,00:43:07.835,I googled. They're divorce lawyers.
00:43:12.214,00:43:15.134,"All right, whatever. You know what? It doesn't matter."
00:43:15.217,00:43:17.678,Okay? I'm gonna be gone in two years anyway.
00:43:17.761,00:43:23.475,"All my friends' parents are divorced, and-- Hey, knock it off."
00:43:28.355,00:43:30.149,"Look, you're gonna get two of everything. Right?"
00:43:30.232,00:43:34.862,"You're gonna get two birthdays, two Thanksgivings, two-- I don't want two of everything."
00:43:35.779,00:43:37.281,"Yeah, well, it's not up to you."
00:43:38.449,00:43:40.409,All right? There's a point you have to grow up.
00:44:11.482,00:44:13.942,I need to see a badge. Sir. Sir!
00:44:14.026,00:44:17.529,What happened out there? There are thermal cameras all over that paddock.
00:44:17.613,00:44:19.073,She did not just disappear!
00:44:23.827,00:44:25.162,Were you not watching?
00:44:25.245,00:44:28.666,She marked up that wall as a distraction. She wanted us to think she escaped.
00:44:28.749,00:44:30.793,Hold on. We are talking about an animal here.
00:44:30.876,00:44:32.836,A highly intelligent animal.
00:44:32.920,00:44:34.588,400 meters to the beacon.
00:44:58.362,00:45:00.781,You're going after her with nonlethals?
00:45:00.864,00:45:03.909,We have $26 million invested in that asset. We can't just kill it.
00:45:04.785,00:45:07.121,-Those men are gonna die. -300 meters to the beacon.
00:45:09.331,00:45:12.334,-Call it off right now. -You are not in control here!
00:45:44.950,00:45:47.828,Blood's not clotted yet. It's close.
00:45:48.745,00:45:50.330,What is that?
00:45:51.498,00:45:54.168,That's her tracking implant. She clawed it out.
00:45:54.626,00:45:56.211,How would it know to do that?
00:45:58.005,00:45:59.882,She remembered where they put it in.
00:46:33.207,00:46:34.625,It can camouflage!
00:47:31.557,00:47:32.849,Evacuate the island.
00:47:34.518,00:47:36.061,We'd never reopen.
00:47:36.687,00:47:40.774,"You made a genetic hybrid, raised it in captivity."
00:47:40.857,00:47:43.235,She is seeing all of this for the first time.
00:47:43.318,00:47:46.113,She does not even know what she is.
00:47:46.196,00:47:48.532,She will kill everything that moves.
00:47:49.575,00:47:52.077,You think the animal is contemplating its own existence?
00:47:52.160,00:47:55.747,"She is learning where she fits in the food chain, and I'm not sure you want her to figure that out."
00:47:56.456,00:48:00.127,"Now, asset Containment can use live ammunition in an emergency situation."
00:48:00.210,00:48:01.962,You have an M-134 in your armory.
00:48:02.045,00:48:04.423,Put it on a chopper and smoke this thing!
00:48:04.506,00:48:07.593,We have families here. I'm not gonna turn this place into some kind of a war zone.
00:48:07.676,00:48:12.139,"-You already have. -Mr. Grady, if you're not gonna help, there's no reason for you to be in here."
00:48:19.021,00:48:22.149,I would have a word with your people in the lab.
00:48:22.733,00:48:26.236,That thing out there-- that's no dinosaur.
00:48:45.422,00:48:48.508,I'm going to close everything north of the resort.
00:48:48.967,00:48:52.095,"This is a phase one, real world. Bring everyone in."
00:48:52.179,00:48:57.059,"This is a phase one, real world. Again, this is a phase 1. Bring everyone back in."
00:49:02.648,00:49:07.152,"because the iron in the dinosaur's blood generates free radicals, and those are highly reactive."
00:49:07.235,00:49:13.241,So the proteins and the cell membranes get all mixed up… and act as a natural preservative.
00:49:13.325,00:49:15.827,DNA can survive for millennia that way.
00:49:15.911,00:49:18.413,"Even if the amber mines dry up, they'll still have bones-- Shut up."
00:49:21.833,00:49:24.336,What do you think's gonna happen from you just staring at them?
00:49:27.339,00:49:29.424,"-Thanks, man. -You're welcome."
00:49:31.843,00:49:33.011,Enjoy the ride.
00:49:40.477,00:49:43.647,should consult with a doctor before riding this ride.
00:49:54.491,00:49:56.076,Enjoy the ride.
00:50:03.291,00:50:04.584,Seriously?
00:50:05.836,00:50:08.255,"Uh, sorry, folks! Ride's closed!"
00:50:17.013,00:50:18.890,"Come on, guys. I just work here."
00:50:30.610,00:50:34.823,You know that I'm not at liberty to reveal the asset's genetic makeup.
00:50:35.449,00:50:37.826,Modified animals are known to be unpredictable.
00:50:38.869,00:50:40.245,"It's killed people, Henry."
00:50:41.663,00:50:42.789,That's unfortunate.
00:50:43.999,00:50:47.169,What purpose could we have for a dinosaur that can camouflage?
00:50:47.711,00:50:52.299,Cuttlefish genes were added to help her withstand an accelerated growth rate.
00:50:52.382,00:50:57.012,Cuttlefish have chromatophores… that allow the skin to change color.
00:50:57.679,00:50:59.181,It hid from thermal technology.
00:51:01.057,00:51:03.226,-Really? -How is that possible?
00:51:07.731,00:51:10.108,Tree frogs can modulate their infrared output.
00:51:10.901,00:51:14.279,We used strands from their DNA to adapt her to a tropical climate.
00:51:14.362,00:51:17.949,But I never imagined-- Who authorized you to do this?
00:51:19.451,00:51:20.786,You did.
00:51:20.869,00:51:23.455,Bigger. Scarier.
00:51:23.538,00:51:28.502,"Um, cooler, I believe, is the word that you used in your memo."
00:51:29.419,00:51:35.050,You cannot have an animal… with exaggerated predator features… without the corresponding behavioral traits.
00:51:35.133,00:51:44.726,"What you're doing here-- What you have done-- The board will shut down this park, seize your work, everything you've built."
00:51:46.144,00:51:49.189,And Hammond won't be there to protect you this time.
00:51:49.272,00:51:53.026,All of this exists because of me.
00:51:53.109,00:51:55.862,"If I don't innovate, somebody else will."
00:51:57.280,00:52:01.493,You are to cease all activities here immediately.
00:52:01.576,00:52:04.913,You are acting like we are engaged in some kind of mad science.
00:52:04.996,00:52:09.417,But we are doing what we have done from the beginning.
00:52:09.501,00:52:12.587,Nothing in Jurassic World is natural.
00:52:12.671,00:52:16.424,We have always filled gaps in the genome with the DNA of other animals.
00:52:16.508,00:52:20.679,"And if their genetic code was pure, many of them would look quite different."
00:52:20.762,00:52:23.723,But you didn't ask for reality. You asked for more teeth.
00:52:23.807,00:52:26.560,-I never asked for a monster! -Monster is a relative term.
00:52:26.643,00:52:29.938,"To a canary, a cat is a monster."
00:52:30.021,00:52:32.524,We're just used to being the cat.
00:52:37.028,00:52:38.655,Hey there. I'm Jimmy Fallon.
00:52:38.738,00:52:42.617,"Welcome aboard the Gyrosphere, an amazing machine made possible by science."
00:52:42.701,00:52:49.541,"Your safety is our main concern, which is why you're behind our invisible barrier system, which protects you from things like dilophosaurus venom."
00:52:51.042,00:52:54.296,"One drop of this could paralyze you, so watch out."
00:52:54.379,00:52:56.631,Is this real? It is?
00:52:57.799,00:53:02.220,"And for added protection, each vehicle is surrounded by aluminum oxynitride glass."
00:53:02.304,00:53:05.473,"So tough, it can stop a .50 caliber bullet."
00:53:08.602,00:53:11.855,The gyroscopic technology will keep you upright at all times.
00:53:11.938,00:53:14.316,-Where are they? -So you've got nothing to worry about.
00:53:55.482,00:53:58.318,Please disembark all rides and return to the resort.
00:54:02.113,00:54:04.282,"No, we can stay out a couple more minutes."
00:54:04.366,00:54:07.202,But they said it was closed.
00:54:07.285,00:54:10.372,"Aunt Claire gave us special wristbands, right? We're VIP, dude."
00:54:11.915,00:54:14.042,Come on. It'll be fun.
00:54:25.095,00:54:28.264,-Celina! Oh! -Mama! Mama!
00:54:30.350,00:54:33.144,"Oh, mi bambina."
00:54:36.231,00:54:38.483,"Oh, mi bambina."
00:54:44.823,00:54:46.074,-Hello? -Zara.
00:54:46.157,00:54:48.868,"-Yeah, I-- I-- -Bring the boys back to the hotel now."
00:54:48.952,00:54:53.623,I've been looking everywhere for them. It's been quite a while-- Slow down. I can't hear.
00:54:53.707,00:54:55.959,"-Zach and Gray, they've run off. -They what?"
00:55:00.880,00:55:02.507,"Hey, Claire."
00:55:02.590,00:55:05.760,"Zach, thank God. Is Gray with you?"
00:55:05.844,00:55:08.930,"Yeah, I-I can't really hear you. We're in the hamster ball."
00:55:09.014,00:55:10.682,"Okay, Zach, listen to me."
00:55:14.102,00:55:17.397,-Hello? Hello? -Wh-- Zach?
00:55:21.317,00:55:23.403,Are there any Gyrospheres left in the valley?
00:55:23.486,00:55:28.199,"They're all accounted for. It's my job Wh-- There-- Yeah, there's one in the field."
00:55:28.283,00:55:30.035,Send a team of rangers. Bring them in.
00:55:30.118,00:55:32.412,"Security, we need a search and rescue in the valley."
00:55:35.290,00:55:39.377,"No, no, no! There are two guests missing! Make this your top priority!"
00:55:39.461,00:55:41.796,"-Just do it, man. -We're doing the best we can."
00:55:41.880,00:55:43.965,"Okay, fine. I'll do it myself."
00:55:44.049,00:55:47.177,Hey! You think I'm the one you need to be worried about right now?
00:55:47.260,00:55:48.928,Back off!
00:55:56.895,00:55:58.605,What happened here?
00:56:01.733,00:56:03.193,Dude.
00:56:03.276,00:56:04.694,Off-road.
00:56:04.778,00:56:07.363,But they told us to go back.
00:56:07.447,00:56:11.868,I'm just worried that you're not getting the full Jurassic World experience.
00:56:11.951,00:56:14.079,Shh.
00:56:19.000,00:56:24.714,the dinosaurs can stay in designated zones… without unnecessary bars or cages.
00:56:29.427,00:56:31.930,-I need you. -Okay.
00:56:32.013,00:56:33.932,"I need your help. My nephews, they're out in the valley."
00:56:34.015,00:56:38.937,"Please, if anything happens to them-- How old?"
00:56:39.020,00:56:41.940,"Uh, the, um-- the older one, he's high school age."
00:56:42.023,00:56:48.154,"The younger one, he's, um-- he's a few years-- You don't know how old your nephews are?"
00:56:51.407,00:56:53.493,-Great idea. -No!
00:56:53.576,00:56:57.789,"We're gonna get arrested, they'll shave our heads, and we're gonna have to make root beer in the toilet."
00:56:57.872,00:56:59.624,What are you talking about?
00:57:03.086,00:57:05.296,You see? I told you.
00:57:05.922,00:57:06.840,You're welcome.
00:57:06.923,00:57:11.219,Up close and personal with four… dinosauruses.
00:57:11.302,00:57:13.263,Ankylosaurus.
00:57:13.346,00:57:14.764,We shouldn't be here.
00:57:14.848,00:57:17.142,And there's five dinosaurs.
00:57:17.517,00:57:20.395,Aren't you supposed to be a genius or something? Look.
00:57:20.478,00:57:24.107,"One, two, three, four."
00:57:24.190,00:57:25.442,Five.
00:57:57.432,00:57:58.933,Drive! Drive! Go!
00:58:31.049,00:58:34.135,"-We're safe in here, right? -Yeah. Totally safe."
00:58:38.890,00:58:40.725,Come on.
00:58:40.808,00:58:43.436,"Pick up. Pick up, pick up, pick up."
00:58:52.195,00:58:53.488,-Zach. -Yeah?
00:59:50.461,00:59:52.171,Go! Go!
00:59:57.677,00:59:59.178,"Gray, go!"
01:00:04.517,01:00:05.810,"Oh, crap!"
01:00:14.527,01:00:16.279,-We're gonna have to jump. -I can't.
01:00:16.362,01:00:18.281,Are you ready? One. Two.
01:01:09.874,01:01:11.125,You jumped.
01:01:31.312,01:01:33.231,Stay in the car.
01:02:18.067,01:02:19.694,Hey.
01:02:19.777,01:02:21.779,"I know, I know."
01:02:26.492,01:02:28.286,Shh.
01:02:28.369,01:02:30.121,Shh-shh-shh.
01:02:31.873,01:02:33.875,That's all right.
01:02:33.958,01:02:35.710,"All right, girl."
01:02:52.685,01:02:55.730,"Okay. Okay. Okay, okay."
01:02:55.813,01:02:57.315,You're okay. Okay.
01:03:51.369,01:03:52.912,It didn't eat 'em.
01:03:54.205,01:03:55.957,It's killing for sport.
01:04:03.381,01:04:05.842,"-Units on standby, ready for go. -Good."
01:04:05.925,01:04:09.053,Hold off on that live feed. We got an evolving situation here.
01:04:09.136,01:04:11.264,They give you the green light yet?
01:04:11.347,01:04:12.807,They will.
01:04:19.105,01:04:21.440,"Owen, we have a situation here."
01:04:32.118,01:04:34.203,an amazing machine made possible by science.
01:04:34.287,01:04:35.788,"…aboard the Gyrosphere-- Hey, there."
01:04:35.872,01:04:38.916,Your safety is our main concern. Now just relax and enjoy the ride.
01:04:59.937,01:05:02.565,"Oh, no, no, no. No!"
01:05:06.068,01:05:08.946,Hey. They made it out.
01:05:22.376,01:05:25.504,"-Oh, my God. They jumped. -Brave kids."
01:05:25.588,01:05:27.882,Zach! Gray!
01:05:31.177,01:05:33.930,Listen. Those kids are still alive.
01:05:34.013,01:05:38.309,But you and I will not be if you continue to scream like that.
01:05:40.978,01:05:42.980,"You can pick up their scent, can't you?"
01:05:43.064,01:05:44.774,"Uh-- Uh, track their footprints?"
01:05:44.857,01:05:46.484,"I was with the navy, not the Navajo."
01:05:46.567,01:05:48.736,So then what should we do? What do you suggest we do?
01:05:48.819,01:05:50.279,You get back. I'll find them.
01:05:50.363,01:05:52.406,No. We'll find them.
01:05:52.490,01:05:54.408,You'll last two minutes in there.
01:05:54.492,01:05:57.036,"Less, in those ridiculous shoes."
01:06:11.050,01:06:12.593,What is that supposed to mean?
01:06:14.178,01:06:15.638,It means I'm ready to go.
01:06:17.098,01:06:19.934,Okay. But let's get one thing straight.
01:06:20.017,01:06:22.770,I'm in charge out here. You do everything I say exactly as I say it.
01:06:22.853,01:06:24.689,-Excuse me? -Just relax.
01:06:27.274,01:06:29.318,Just like taking a stroll through the woods.
01:06:30.820,01:06:33.406,Sixty-five million years ago.
01:07:08.733,01:07:09.692,Stay here.
01:08:00.701,01:08:02.119,Wow.
01:08:37.446,01:08:38.739,You still have those matches?
01:08:41.283,01:08:42.868,Here you go.
01:09:07.351,01:09:08.269,Gray.
01:09:38.924,01:09:42.136,1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara. Sand beige.
01:09:45.181,01:09:47.641,"You remember when we fixed up Grandpa's old Malibu, right?"
01:09:48.809,01:09:50.227,Yeah.
01:10:01.238,01:10:02.781,It's headed right for the park.
01:10:02.865,01:10:05.910,Why would she come here? She can sense thermal radiation.
01:10:05.993,01:10:09.371,Our emergency measures just put all the warm bodies in one place.
01:10:11.290,01:10:12.374,-Sir-- -InGen.
01:10:14.210,01:10:15.419,Hoskins.
01:10:16.629,01:10:19.924,-I know who you are. -Then you know why I'm here.
01:10:22.009,01:10:24.762,I've been working for two years on an application for those raptors.
01:10:26.805,01:10:28.682,They can hunt and kill that creature.
01:10:28.766,01:10:31.143,Your program was to test their intelligence.
01:10:31.227,01:10:33.103,"Yeah, it was. And we did."
01:10:33.187,01:10:36.398,"And in the process, we learned something."
01:10:36.482,01:10:38.943,They follow orders.
01:10:39.026,01:10:42.947,"You see, the solution to your crisis is standing right in front of you."
01:10:43.989,01:10:47.159,Let me be as clear as I can.
01:10:47.243,01:10:50.871,No velociraptors are going to be set loose on this island.
01:10:52.373,01:10:55.459,You're out of your mind. What are you gonna do with all these people?
01:10:55.542,01:10:57.336,"You got 20,000 people here. What are you gonna do?"
01:10:57.419,01:10:59.797,They have no place to go.
01:10:59.880,01:11:02.007,That thing is a killing machine.
01:11:04.802,01:11:06.637,And it will not stop.
01:11:08.430,01:11:16.522,Okay. I intend to personally look into your project to determine its viability… within the moral principles of this company.
01:11:19.191,01:11:20.651,"Okay, boss."
01:11:22.569,01:11:24.280,What's your next move?
01:11:33.497,01:11:36.709,-I can't get ahold of your instructor. -Never mind.
01:11:36.792,01:11:38.752,He's likely caught up in the evacuation.
01:11:38.836,01:11:41.005,And you're sure there's nobody else who can fly a helicopter?
01:11:43.090,01:11:44.550,We don't need anyone else.
01:12:07.239,01:12:08.699,You think it's out there?
01:12:14.872,01:12:18.459,"I mean, I know for a fact it is definitely not out there."
01:12:18.542,01:12:20.627,All right? We're totally safe.
01:12:21.462,01:12:23.714,Here. Go take this.
01:12:25.674,01:12:27.384,You're stronger than me.
01:12:38.979,01:12:40.481,All right. Turn it over.
01:12:43.192,01:12:45.027,Whoo! It works!
01:12:51.742,01:12:53.994,I thought you failed your driver's test.
01:12:54.078,01:12:55.829,No. Only the driving part.
01:13:14.098,01:13:16.725,-This one of theirs? -Yeah.
01:13:18.268,01:13:20.062,That road goes straight back to the park.
01:13:22.815,01:13:24.817,How'd they even get one of these things started?
01:13:38.789,01:13:40.207,"Oh, God."
01:15:10.923,01:15:14.343,"South of the Gyrosphere valley, between the old park and the aviary."
01:15:14.426,01:15:16.553,Wait. Are you following the dinosaur?
01:15:16.637,01:15:20.057,Yes. Get ACU out here. Real guns this time.
01:15:20.140,01:15:23.519,ACU is airborne. They took the helicopter.
01:15:23.602,01:15:25.145,Who's flying it?
01:15:27.814,01:15:30.192,Did you boys serve in the armed forces?
01:15:30.275,01:15:32.110,"Afghanistan, sir."
01:15:32.194,01:15:34.613,Did your general ever fly into battle with you?
01:15:38.408,01:15:41.036,Got it. Got it.
01:15:45.332,01:15:46.708,Proceed and engage.
01:15:46.792,01:15:48.252,"Come on. Look alive, boys."
01:15:49.503,01:15:51.004,Look alive!
01:15:58.887,01:16:00.889,10 o'clock! By the birdcage!
01:16:21.660,01:16:24.580,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no! No!"
01:16:24.663,01:16:26.748,Looks like the fox got in the henhouse.
01:16:44.141,01:16:47.311,"Pull up! Pull up! Up, up, up, up!"
01:17:20.385,01:17:22.929,We have a breach in the aviary.
01:17:43.158,01:17:45.035,The trees. The trees. Go! Go!
01:18:10.143,01:18:13.480,Okay. That's it. We're safe now.
01:18:23.156,01:18:26.201,-Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! -Shit!
01:18:26.284,01:18:28.328,Hurry up! Go!
01:18:38.672,01:18:40.340,That's a first.
01:18:40.424,01:18:41.925,-Open the gate! -Open the gate!
01:18:42.008,01:18:43.552,-Let us in! -Open the gate!
01:18:54.730,01:18:56.273,There has been a containment breach.
01:18:56.565,01:18:57.524,Hello?
01:18:57.607,01:19:00.068,"Claire, we spotted the boys on surveillance."
01:19:00.152,01:19:01.945,They're approaching the west gate. I'm headed there now.
01:19:02.028,01:19:04.865,Okay. Okay. Stay right there.
01:19:04.948,01:19:07.242,I'm on my way. Stay right with them.
01:19:07.325,01:19:09.411,Hey! Get on.
01:19:27.095,01:19:29.264,all guests must take shelter immediately.
01:19:31.683,01:19:36.855,"Ladies and gentlemen, due to a containment anomaly, all guests must take shelter immediately."
01:20:44.673,01:20:46.967,"-Claire. Come on. -I repeat, do not fire live ammunition."
01:21:21.209,01:21:23.086,Don't just stand there!
01:22:03.043,01:22:04.669,"Go. Get inside, now!"
01:22:21.728,01:22:22.938,Zach!
01:22:23.688,01:22:24.898,Gray!
01:22:34.324,01:23:03.103,No! Hold-- Is that Aunt Claire?
01:23:23.581,01:23:27.419,It's them. Zach! Gray!
01:23:27.502,01:23:29.087,"Oh, my God. Thank God. Thank God."
01:23:29.170,01:23:30.755,What happened? What is this?
01:23:30.839,01:23:34.175,Are you okay? Where did you go?
01:23:34.259,01:23:35.885,Why didn't you come back?
01:23:35.969,01:23:38.304,I was so worried about you. Who's that?
01:23:44.602,01:23:45.729,We work together.
01:23:49.399,01:23:51.568,"-We gotta go. -Okay. Come on. Come on, come on."
01:23:54.404,01:23:59.659,"Hey, hey. You guys can't just be walking up in-- Simon Masrani's death was a tragedy."
01:24:01.244,01:24:04.706,The new mission is to prevent further loss of life.
01:24:04.789,01:24:07.792,"-Uh, who are these guys? -I'm glad you asked."
01:24:08.668,01:24:10.086,You're all relieved of duty.
01:24:10.962,01:24:13.048,There's a new team on the ground.
01:24:32.358,01:24:34.903,"-Lowery, I'm on my way back to you. -That's a bad idea."
01:24:34.986,01:24:38.656,The board assigned emergency ops to InGen's private security division.
01:24:40.950,01:24:44.454,And he has this insane plan to use the raptors to hunt the Indominus.
01:24:44.537,01:24:46.831,"What do you mean, use the raptors?"
01:24:46.915,01:24:48.666,Son of a bitch!
01:24:51.544,01:24:54.589,Take the kids. Get 'em someplace safe.
01:25:09.104,01:25:10.021,Drive.
01:25:11.106,01:25:13.024,-You got it. You got this. -Go! Go faster!
01:25:13.108,01:25:13.942,-Drive! -Go!
01:25:20.490,01:25:23.326,-This does not feel safe. -Can we stay with you?
01:25:23.409,01:25:25.453,I am never leaving you as long as you live.
01:25:25.537,01:25:26.621,"No, no. Him."
01:25:29.249,01:25:30.458,Yeah. Definitely him.
01:25:58.653,01:26:00.446,Hey. Right here.
01:26:06.619,01:26:08.371,Usually what she wants to eat.
01:26:27.682,01:26:30.101,The mother hen has finally arrived.
01:26:30.185,01:26:31.394,-Oh. -Oh!
01:26:32.770,01:26:36.316,Get the hell out of here and stay away from my animals.
01:26:37.317,01:26:40.278,"Hoskins, you wanted this to happen, you son of a bitch."
01:26:40.361,01:26:46.201,"Oh, Jesus. How many more people have to die… before this mission starts to make sense to you?"
01:26:46.284,01:26:48.995,It's not a mission. It's a field test.
01:26:49.954,01:26:52.665,This is an InGen situation now.
01:26:52.749,01:26:56.461,"Okay, there are gonna be cruise ships that show up here at first light."
01:26:56.544,01:26:58.087,Everybody's gonna get off this island.
01:26:58.171,01:27:02.050,You're gonna watch a news story tomorrow about how you all saved lives.
01:27:02.133,01:27:06.137,"No, no, no. Better yet, how your animals saved lives."
01:27:08.431,01:27:11.684,They've never been out of containment. It's crazy.
01:27:14.062,01:27:17.982,This is happening. With or without you.
01:27:22.862,01:27:24.906,We know that she is in sector five.
01:27:24.989,01:27:27.742,This is a game we call hide-and-seek. It's a scent drill.
01:27:27.825,01:27:30.662,We've done it about a thousand times with these animals.
01:27:30.745,01:27:36.251,"When they get on target, and they will get on target, wait to engage."
01:27:36.334,01:27:38.920,Velociraptors are pack hunters.
01:27:39.003,01:27:42.799,They like to herd the animal into a kill zone. That's when we take our shot.
01:27:42.882,01:27:46.344,"Get a clear shot, wait on my command and give her everything you got."
01:27:46.427,01:27:48.763,"We got one good target, gentlemen."
01:27:48.846,01:27:50.431,Do not shoot my raptors.
01:27:51.891,01:27:53.017,Please.
01:27:56.521,01:27:57.981,Easy.
01:27:59.190,01:28:00.441,Attagirl.
01:28:03.361,01:28:04.862,You don't scare me.
01:28:11.244,01:28:12.537,Are they safe?
01:28:13.871,01:28:14.706,"No, they're not."
01:28:15.832,01:28:17.542,What are their names?
01:28:17.625,01:28:23.965,"Well, you got Charlie, there's Echo, here is Delta, and this one's called Blue."
01:28:25.174,01:28:27.719,-She's the beta. -Who's the alpha?
01:28:28.303,01:28:29.304,"You're looking at him, kid."
01:28:34.934,01:28:36.853,See? Totally safe.
01:28:39.063,01:28:40.857,All right. Get in. Come on.
01:28:40.940,01:28:42.317,Get in there.
01:28:44.902,01:28:47.530,"If you need me, I'll be right up front."
01:28:47.613,01:28:50.867,Just open that window. Okay?
01:28:51.784,01:28:52.660,Put your seat belts on.
01:28:57.165,01:29:00.918,Okay. So just-- Hold hands.
01:29:20.688,01:29:22.815,"Nothing's getting in here, right?"
01:29:26.277,01:29:27.487,Hey.
01:29:29.405,01:29:31.366,Do you remember that ghost at the old house?
01:29:31.449,01:29:33.951,Do you remember? The one in the garage?
01:29:35.411,01:29:36.871,"I protected you, right?"
01:29:39.374,01:29:43.169,You made a battle ax… out of a ruler and a paper plate.
01:29:43.252,01:29:44.837,Yeah.
01:29:44.921,01:29:47.340,"See, nothing's gonna get you while I'm around. Okay?"
01:29:48.508,01:29:51.010,But you're not always gonna be around.
01:29:52.345,01:29:59.143,"Yeah, well-- Hey. We're brothers, okay?"
01:29:59.227,01:30:02.522,"We'll always be brothers, and we'll always come back to one another."
01:30:05.483,01:30:08.820,-No matter what. -No matter what.
01:30:09.862,01:30:10.822,No matter what.
01:30:33.219,01:30:34.720,Awesome.
01:32:00.556,01:32:02.016,Your boyfriend's a badass.
01:32:15.613,01:32:17.865,Imagine if we had these puppies in Tora Bora.
01:32:20.743,01:32:22.495,You recording this thing?
01:32:35.132,01:32:36.133,They're slowing down.
01:32:37.385,01:32:38.928,They got something.
01:32:57.488,01:32:59.573,"You know what? No, no, no. You guys are not gonna watch this."
01:32:59.657,01:33:01.284,"-No, no, no! -Keep the window closed."
01:33:37.737,01:33:38.946,Something's wrong.
01:33:40.197,01:33:41.365,They're communicating.
01:33:49.040,01:33:52.043,I know why they wouldn't tell us what it's made of.
01:33:52.460,01:33:53.210,Why?
01:33:58.007,01:34:00.176,That thing's part raptor.
01:34:07.808,01:34:09.560,What's taking them so long? Light it up!
01:34:09.643,01:34:10.978,Engage!
01:34:25.826,01:34:27.203,"Oh, my God."
01:34:38.672,01:34:40.591,Watch your 6:00.
01:34:40.674,01:34:42.635,Raptors got a new alpha.
01:36:06.260,01:36:08.429,Fall back!
01:36:28.157,01:36:29.700,Stop! Stop!
01:36:29.783,01:36:31.911,No! Blue!
01:36:49.678,01:36:51.138,"Uh-- No, no, no. No."
01:36:51.222,01:36:52.890,-Everyone is fine. -Don't lie to him.
01:36:52.973,01:36:56.143,He's scared! It's okay to lie when people are scared.
01:36:56.227,01:36:57.311,I want to go home.
01:36:57.394,01:36:59.813,"Oh, sweetheart, you will, okay? I promise."
01:36:59.897,01:37:05.236,"Tomorrow you will be home, and your mother will never let me see you again."
01:37:11.909,01:37:13.035,They're coming!
01:38:15.472,01:38:17.016,-Turn it on! -I don't know how!
01:38:29.987,01:38:32.948,-Are you boys okay? -Hey. Did you see that?
01:38:33.449,01:38:34.825,I can't wait to tell Mom.
01:38:34.908,01:38:36.368,"Oh, please, no."
01:38:36.452,01:38:38.454,"Do not tell your mother about that, ever."
01:38:41.540,01:38:42.916,-Owen! -Owen!
01:38:43.000,01:38:44.877,-Yeah! -Yeah!
01:38:47.963,01:38:50.132,We gotta get indoors. Follow me.
01:38:56.138,01:38:59.266,"Lowery, we're headed your way. Call in a chopper."
01:39:12.404,01:39:14.907,Everything must be accounted for.
01:39:14.990,01:39:17.117,I want all backup generators online.
01:39:24.333,01:39:27.586,Change of plans. Mission took a jog to the left.
01:39:27.670,01:39:29.213,I'm taking everything off-site.
01:39:29.296,01:39:33.175,The embryos are safe here. They can live up to eight weeks on the generators.
01:39:33.258,01:39:34.426,"No, no. You-- You listen."
01:39:34.510,01:39:36.595,Park's gonna be Chapter 11 by morning.
01:39:36.679,01:39:39.556,Okay? Our little side project's about to get a shot in the arm.
01:39:39.640,01:39:42.351,I don't want a bunch of lawyers messing around with something they don't get.
01:39:43.852,01:39:45.145,You get it?
01:39:45.896,01:39:48.399,Hey. I'm gonna take that as a yes.
01:39:53.987,01:39:57.950,The next ferry will be leaving in 45 minutes.
01:39:58.033,01:40:02.788,"If you require immediate medical attention, please report to the nearest health service station."
01:40:02.871,01:40:04.665,Is this what you had in mind?
01:40:11.213,01:40:13.048,-Hey. -They said we had to evacuate.
01:40:13.132,01:40:15.300,There's a boat. You coming?
01:40:23.767,01:40:25.310,Someone has to stay behind.
01:40:30.023,01:40:32.317,Oh. No. I-- I have a boyfriend.
01:40:33.527,01:40:36.530,"Yeah, but I didn't know that you guys were, like, together-together."
01:40:36.613,01:40:40.200,"-We are. -That's cool. I just-- You've never, like-- You don't mention him, ever."
01:40:40.284,01:40:42.619,"-No. I'm at work. -Oh, I know. Yeah."
01:40:43.871,01:40:46.039,-Well-- -Yeah. Okay.
01:40:46.123,01:40:47.249,-Great. -Great.
01:40:47.332,01:40:48.167,-Okay. -Okay.
01:40:48.250,01:40:49.710,-You gonna be okay? -Yeah.
01:40:50.461,01:40:51.754,Okay. Bye.
01:41:00.137,01:41:02.264,Where's Hoskins?
01:41:02.347,01:41:05.058,He's sending you and the assets to a secure location.
01:41:05.142,01:41:06.727,But our deal is still intact?
01:41:06.810,01:41:09.730,Don't worry. You'll be well taken care of. Let's go!
01:41:19.198,01:41:21.408,We hope you enjoyed your adventure.
01:41:21.492,01:41:27.372,"Don't forget to visit the gift shop, and remember it's always happy hour at Margaritaville."
01:41:31.293,01:41:33.587,"Come on. Come on, come on. Go inside, okay?"
01:41:41.220,01:41:42.679,Control room. That way!
01:41:53.607,01:41:55.192,They evacuated the lab.
01:42:35.983,01:42:37.609,What are you doing?
01:42:37.693,01:42:39.903,"I'm afraid that's above your pay grade, honey."
01:42:41.822,01:42:42.865,Where's Henry?
01:42:43.991,01:42:45.701,"Dr. Wu, he works for us."
01:42:46.994,01:42:48.537,That's not a real dinosaur.
01:42:49.746,01:42:52.207,"No. It ain't, kid."
01:42:53.792,01:42:56.545,But somebody's gotta make sure that this company has a future.
01:42:57.254,01:43:09.141,"Imagine that one: a fraction of the size, deadly, intelligent, able to hide from the most advanced military technology."
01:43:09.224,01:43:12.978,A living weapon unlike anything we've ever seen.
01:43:13.061,01:43:18.692,"You see, millions of years of evolution-- What'd we learn?"
01:43:19.943,01:43:28.410,Nature is the gift-- Easy.
01:43:29.536,01:43:30.913,"Easy, boy."
01:43:32.956,01:43:34.333,Hey. Hey.
01:43:36.084,01:43:38.754,"We're-- We're on the same side, right?"
01:43:38.837,01:43:39.922,Right?
01:43:41.673,01:43:44.593,Easy. Easy.
01:43:45.594,01:43:47.596,I'm on your side.
01:43:56.730,01:43:59.066,"No, boys. Boys, this way. Come on. Come on."
01:44:35.310,01:44:36.812,"That's how it is, huh?"
01:44:54.621,01:44:55.706,Easy.
01:44:59.626,01:45:00.585,Easy.
01:45:10.929,01:45:12.472,That's it.
01:46:22.042,01:46:24.211,Twenty-four. Fifteen.
01:46:24.961,01:46:25.796,We need more.
01:46:27.589,01:46:30.050,-More what? -Teeth.
01:46:30.133,01:46:31.426,We need more teeth.
01:46:41.394,01:46:43.522,"Okay, so-- You just wait here."
01:47:35.240,01:47:38.326,"-Lowery, are you still there? -Hey, where are you?"
01:47:38.410,01:47:40.453,I need you to open paddock nine.
01:47:41.288,01:47:42.789,Paddock nine?
01:47:50.297,01:47:53.508,"Damn it, Lowery. Be a man and do something for once in your life."
01:47:53.592,01:47:55.510,Why do you have to make it personal?
01:50:10.520,01:50:11.688,Run!
01:50:12.397,01:50:13.940,"Go! Go, go!"
01:53:42.857,01:53:43.858,My God. It's your parents.
01:53:43.942,01:53:45.443,It's your parents.
01:53:46.945,01:53:48.446,Come on. Come on.
01:54:03.795,01:54:05.463,I'm so sorry.
01:54:05.547,01:54:08.383,Shh. Are you okay?
01:54:13.346,01:54:14.556,Come here.
01:54:34.993,01:54:36.452,So what do we do now?
01:54:38.162,01:54:40.039,Probably stick together.
01:54:41.875,01:54:43.334,For survival.
