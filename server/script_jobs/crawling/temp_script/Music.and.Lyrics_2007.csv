00:01:00.227,00:03:11.441,A shock inside me That words just can't describe BOTH: And there's no explaining Something in the way you move I can't deny Every word from your lips is a lullaby A twist of fate makes life worthwhile You are gold and silver I said I wasn't gonna lose my head -But then pop goes my heart -Pop goes my heart I wasn't gonna fall in love again But then pop goes my heart ALL: Pop goes my heart And I just can't let you go I can't lose this feeling These precious moments We have so few Let's go far away Where there's nothing to do but play You've shown to me That my destiny's with you And there's no explaining I said I wasn't gonna lose my head But then pop goes my heart ALL: Pop goes my heart I wasn't gonna fall in love again But then pop goes my heart ALL: Pop goes my heart And I just can't let you go I can't lose this feeling A twist of fate makes life worthwhile You are gold and silver I said I wasn't gonna lose my head -But then pop goes my heart -Pop goes my heart I wasn't gonna fall in love again -But then pop goes my heart -Pop goes my heart And I just can't let you go But today they're best known as Colin Thompson's old group.
00:03:11.524,00:03:21.284,"Colin, or as he's been dubbed by the Queen, Sir Colin, has gone on to sell millions of records, starred in blockbuster films and create his own cologne, A Whiff of Colin."
00:03:21.368,00:03:22.785,But here's a question.
00:03:22.869,00:03:26.289,Can you remember the name of the other guy in PoP?
00:03:26.373,00:03:29.208,Whatever happened to Alex Fletcher?
00:03:30.042,00:03:34.046,Tonight we find out on Battle of the '80s Has-Beens.
00:03:35.507,00:03:37.717,We think it's gonna be bigger than American Idol.
00:03:38.718,00:03:40.136,"So, what do you think, Alex?"
00:03:40.220,00:03:41.763,"Well, I love it."
00:03:41.846,00:03:45.642,"It's brilliant on so many levels, I don't even know where to start."
00:03:45.725,00:03:46.768,DAVID: Good for you.
00:03:46.934,00:03:53.024,Because some of the people we've approached have had a little problem with the term has-been.
00:03:53.107,00:03:54.234,ALEX: Have they? Have they?
00:03:54.567,00:03:58.946,"You see, I, I don't share that. I am a happy has-been. Really."
00:03:59.071,00:04:01.366,It's a very clear statement: I live in the past.
00:04:01.449,00:04:03.243,Everything good I ever did was long ago.
00:04:03.326,00:04:05.662,So don't expect anything new or exciting from me now.
00:04:05.745,00:04:08.665,Really takes the pressure off. Especially on a first date.
00:04:08.998,00:04:10.207,DAVID: Good for you.
00:04:11.083,00:04:15.547,"So, uh, we've already taped several shows and we're going to start airing them this week."
00:04:15.630,00:04:18.675,And some of the performers include REO Speedwagon.
00:04:18.758,00:04:20.927,-Speedwagon. -Flock of Seagulls.
00:04:21.010,00:04:22.094,The Flock? Okay.
00:04:22.345,00:04:24.013,"-Debbie Gibson, Tiffany... -ALEX: Debbie."
00:04:28.601,00:04:30.353,So Relax.
00:04:31.813,00:04:33.022,Nice one.
00:04:33.105,00:04:36.443,"Um, good. Okay. Worthy adversaries, all."
00:04:36.526,00:04:38.861,"Uh, and, um, how many songs would I actually get to perform?"
00:04:39.446,00:04:41.406,"I'd like to do two, you know?"
00:04:41.489,00:04:45.535,A ballad and then maybe a more up-tempo number where I get to shake it a bit.
00:04:46.619,00:04:50.957,I can't promise any of the acts that they'll be singing.
00:04:56.045,00:04:57.630,DAVID: Boxing.
00:04:59.466,00:05:03.678,That's why the show is called Battle of the '80s Has-Beens.
00:05:03.761,00:05:06.931,Only the winner gets to sing.
00:05:09.892,00:05:11.728,Oh.
00:05:14.606,00:05:17.024,"Right, right, right. Got you."
00:05:23.155,00:05:25.032,"-Afternoon, Mr. Fletcher. -Hello, Willy."
00:05:25.116,00:05:26.242,Have a good day.
00:05:26.326,00:05:28.160,"Yes, well, enjoyed it so far."
00:05:29.579,00:05:32.248,"-CHRIS: All right. There he is. -Oh, my manager."
00:05:32.332,00:05:35.251,"All right, listen, I had no idea they meant boxing."
00:05:35.335,00:05:37.211,"Nobody said a word to me, I swear."
00:05:37.294,00:05:39.922,"No, it's not a problem. I can definitely take Flock of Seagulls."
00:05:40.006,00:05:42.509,We did a tour with them in '89 and we beat them severely.
00:05:42.592,00:05:44.135,They cried like little girls.
00:05:44.218,00:05:47.889,"All right, listen. It's my fault and I hate myself for it, but I'm not upset."
00:05:48.014,00:05:49.557,And do you know why?
00:05:49.641,00:05:51.017,"Uh, you've been at my liquor."
00:05:51.768,00:05:53.520,Because of her.
00:05:54.479,00:05:56.773,CHRIS: Cora Corman. Biggest star in the world.
00:05:56.856,00:05:59.526,Bigger than Britney and Christina put together.
00:05:59.776,00:06:02.862,And guess who she loves.
00:06:03.195,00:06:04.238,Her country?
00:06:05.114,00:06:09.285,"You. She's a huge PoP fan and she wants to meet you, Alex."
00:06:14.499,00:06:15.625,"Khan, I've missed you."
00:06:15.708,00:06:17.919,"KHAN: Alex, I have Sophie here for you."
00:06:18.002,00:06:19.504,"Uh, that sounds like fun. Who is she?"
00:06:19.712,00:06:21.631,She's here to do your plants.
00:06:21.714,00:06:23.299,"ALEX: Uh, but Jane does my plants."
00:06:23.382,00:06:27.512,"She says she can be in and out in five minutes, and this is really the best time for her."
00:06:27.595,00:06:29.722,It seems she cannot be stopped. Send her up.
00:06:30.389,00:06:32.642,So start again. Cora Corman.
00:06:32.725,00:06:35.728,Why do you have a plant lady? Why do you even have plants?
00:06:36.395,00:06:43.194,"Because from time to time, ladies accompany me back to the apartment, and one of them once mentioned that plants make women feel comfortable."
00:06:43.277,00:06:46.030,Is that true? Plants make women comfortable?
00:06:46.698,00:06:49.617,"Well, maybe if I had plants I'd still be married."
00:06:49.701,00:06:51.160,"Yes, I think that was the problem."
00:06:51.243,00:06:55.122,"Not Susan's affair and raging nymphomania, but your lack of vegetation."
00:06:57.041,00:06:58.250,Hang on.
00:07:03.840,00:07:06.551,"-Hi, I'm Sophie Fisher. -I'm Alex Fletcher."
00:07:06.759,00:07:09.762,"-You didn't get the message from Jane? -No, no, no. I haven't listened to my..."
00:07:09.929,00:07:12.599,She was supposed to call you and let you know I'd be doing your plants for couple of days.
00:07:13.099,00:07:15.351,"Very nice. Lovely. Well, come on in."
00:07:15.435,00:07:16.686,Thank you.
00:07:16.769,00:07:20.815,I hope you have your own watering can because Jane told me that everyone had their own.
00:07:20.898,00:07:28.030,"But this last guy, Mr. Werther, about 80, he didn't have his own watering can, so he starts yelling at me and screaming at me in German..."
00:07:29.782,00:07:31.868,"And unfortunately, I'm fluent enough to know what he's saying."
00:07:31.951,00:07:34.203,You haven't been cursed at until you've been cursed at in German.
00:07:34.286,00:07:37.206,"As a matter of fact, I know what you mean. I dated a Fr√§ulein once."
00:07:37.289,00:07:38.290,Um...
00:07:38.374,00:07:41.753,"Plant stuff is in the kitchen under the sink. And, um, I have my own can."
00:07:41.836,00:07:44.464,"-Oh, well, vielen Dank. -Mmm-hmm."
00:07:45.089,00:07:47.634,"Hi, I'm Chris Riley, Alex's manager."
00:07:47.717,00:07:50.219,"Oh, Sophie Fisher. Nice to meet you."
00:07:52.138,00:07:53.598,"So, kitchen?"
00:07:54.807,00:07:56.058,-Yeah. -Great.
00:07:58.811,00:08:01.105,"So Cora Corman, huh? How great is that? Do you believe it?"
00:08:01.188,00:08:04.567,"All right, wait, wait, wait. Is it even a good idea? Pros and cons."
00:08:04.651,00:08:09.321,"Pros, she's a huge star, great publicity, terrific money."
00:08:10.281,00:08:11.616,Cons?
00:08:11.699,00:08:14.410,"No matter what you do, in 40 years we'll both be dead."
00:08:14.494,00:08:18.289,"Okay. Huge star, great publicity, terrific money versus eventual death."
00:08:18.372,00:08:19.916,"Oh, I think we have to think about it."
00:08:20.249,00:08:22.459,"Okay, good, because Cora is shooting a video tonight."
00:08:22.544,00:08:25.547,-She wants to meet both of us right after. -Tonight? She wants meet tonight?
00:08:25.630,00:08:26.631,"-Yes, tonight. -SOPHIE: Ow!"
00:08:28.049,00:08:29.466,-Mmm-mmm. -You all right?
00:08:29.801,00:08:31.010,Um...
00:08:31.093,00:08:33.596,Do you have a Band-Aid and antibiotic cream?
00:08:34.180,00:08:37.224,"No, no. And sadly, I think I've lent out my iron lung."
00:08:38.059,00:08:39.185,Oh. Okay.
00:08:39.268,00:08:42.855,"Well, then I'm gonna go because, you know, this could get infected."
00:08:42.939,00:08:46.984,"And it's not clotting yet, but, I mean, I'm a little hypochondriacal."
00:08:47.068,00:08:48.945,"You just, you can never be too careful."
00:08:49.028,00:08:51.322,"Um, anyway, I'll come back and finish."
00:08:51.405,00:08:52.907,"Um, so come again."
00:08:52.990,00:08:54.867,"I mean, you live here. I'll come again."
00:08:54.992,00:08:56.493,I'm gonna go get this looked at.
00:08:56.578,00:08:58.788,"I mean, you should really have a first-aid kit."
00:08:58.871,00:09:00.540,Thank you. Have a good night. I'll see you.
00:09:03.417,00:09:04.669,Weird.
00:09:04.752,00:09:07.463,-Don't give her a key. -No.
00:09:07.547,00:09:09.465,So you said something about tonight.
00:09:09.549,00:09:10.883,Tonight we meet Cora.
00:09:17.056,00:09:44.166,"I've got to have my Buddha's delight Om shanti, shanti I've got to have my Buddha's delight Om shanti, shanti I want a revelation And sweet salvation And the eternal fire Show me the eternal fire Like sitting meditation You give me elevation Can you take me higher?"
00:09:44.375,00:09:46.335,She seems like a very spiritual kid.
00:09:46.753,00:09:49.421,Yeah. It's nice to see a young woman exploring religion.
00:09:56.512,00:10:09.609,I'm not satisfied if I don't get My Buddha's delight MAN: And cut.
00:10:10.943,00:10:12.028,CHRIS: Terrific.
00:10:13.863,00:10:15.823,"Hey, how's it going? I'm Ray, Cora's manager."
00:10:15.907,00:10:17.033,-Chris Riley. -Nice to meet you.
00:10:17.116,00:10:18.409,"-You know Alex Fletcher. -Hi, Ray?"
00:10:18.492,00:10:19.702,"-Ray, um... -Just Ray."
00:10:19.786,00:10:21.954,"Cora's this way, come on. Follow me."
00:10:25.166,00:10:27.877,"C, this is Alex Fletcher and his manager, Chris Riley."
00:10:28.002,00:10:31.130,-We loved the video. It was unbelievable. -Yeah.
00:10:31.338,00:10:34.591,"You know, I wish I brought my daughter. She worships you."
00:10:34.967,00:10:38.012,I'm divorced. But that's another story.
00:10:41.473,00:10:43.475,"Mr. Fletcher, it's a pleasure."
00:10:45.061,00:10:49.691,Your song Dance With Me Tonight got me through my parents' divorce when I was seven.
00:10:49.857,00:10:51.025,Really? Wow.
00:10:51.150,00:10:52.902,"Yeah, because I recorded that when I was nine."
00:10:54.153,00:10:58.157,I want my fans to know the same spiritual uplift that your music gave me.
00:10:58.449,00:10:59.575,That would be lovely.
00:10:59.659,00:11:01.953,I actually have a few tunes it would be nice to update.
00:11:02.161,00:11:04.163,"Oh, I don't live in the past, Mr. Fletcher."
00:11:04.246,00:11:05.832,It was so long ago.
00:11:05.915,00:11:07.917,I want you to write a new song.
00:11:08.000,00:11:09.085,Ah.
00:11:09.168,00:11:12.588,-Okay. Um... -You see I recently broke up with my boyfriend.
00:11:12.671,00:11:14.882,We had been together for almost two months.
00:11:15.925,00:11:17.593,It was a terrible experience.
00:11:17.885,00:11:21.680,But then I read a book by Guru Mathashavi called A Way Back Into Love.
00:11:22.306,00:11:24.350,And that will be the title of our new song.
00:11:24.934,00:11:29.146,"And in two weeks when I open my tour at Madison Square Garden, we'll perform it together."
00:11:29.521,00:11:31.148,Okay. Here's the snag...
00:11:31.232,00:11:35.361,"We also wanna put the song on her new CD which is pretty much finished, so we need it by Friday."
00:11:36.153,00:11:38.530,"-You talking about this Friday? -Yeah, but don't feel any pressure."
00:11:38.655,00:11:43.828,"We've got seven other retro artists working on Way Back Into Love, so if you blow it, we're covered."
00:11:44.578,00:11:47.915,"Mr. Fletcher, don't look at this as a competition."
00:11:47.999,00:11:50.209,"If it's meant to be, it will be."
00:11:51.085,00:11:52.211,It's destiny.
00:11:52.294,00:11:53.295,Yes.
00:11:53.880,00:11:55.047,Or not.
00:12:00.511,00:12:01.512,Okay.
00:12:02.096,00:12:04.807,I can't possibly write a song by Friday. What could she be thinking of?
00:12:04.891,00:12:07.309,"All right. Look, look, can I be honest with you?"
00:12:07.393,00:12:09.896,"Of course not, you're my manager. I would have to fire you immediately."
00:12:10.104,00:12:11.397,We need this.
00:12:11.480,00:12:16.152,"Well, let's not be desperate. We have the state fairs tour coming up -and Knott's Berry Farm. -They've canceled."
00:12:18.695,00:12:20.489,Knott's Berry canceled?
00:12:21.365,00:12:24.535,"Look. We're still on for the Indiana State Fair, okay?"
00:12:24.618,00:12:26.370,But Texas and Arkansas dropped us.
00:12:27.496,00:12:34.003,"-The Apple Picking? -The Apple Picking Festival is a go, but Great Adventure only wants three nights instead of 10. All right?"
00:12:34.086,00:12:35.462,"Oh, my God. I had no idea."
00:12:35.546,00:12:37.173,Why didn't you tell me these things? Why...
00:12:37.256,00:12:39.300,"I'm telling, I'm telling you now."
00:12:39.383,00:12:42.428,"Alex, it's been 15 years since PoP."
00:12:42.511,00:12:45.222,There's new old acts coming up all the time.
00:12:45.306,00:12:49.310,Tears for Fears is going on tour. There's talk of a Spice Girl reunion.
00:12:49.393,00:12:51.187,"-Well, that's not my audience. -Ricky Martin."
00:12:51.270,00:12:53.689,I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm finished. I'm finished.
00:12:53.772,00:12:56.818,"-No, no, you're not, you're not dead. -I'm gonna wind up doing bar mitzvahs."
00:12:56.901,00:13:00.905,"No, you're not. 13-year-old kids have no idea who you are."
00:13:00.988,00:13:02.364,"Well, that's good to know."
00:13:02.448,00:13:05.242,"Well, what about you? You might actually have to take on another client."
00:13:05.326,00:13:06.618,"Well, don't worry about me."
00:13:06.702,00:13:09.831,What we gotta concentrate on is refreshing your image.
00:13:09.914,00:13:13.250,Then we'll get Knott's Berry and Great Adventure. Who knows?
00:13:13.334,00:13:15.044,We might even get Disneyland.
00:13:15.127,00:13:16.753,Don't tease me. I'm very vulnerable at the moment.
00:13:16.838,00:13:22.176,"Tell you something, Alex. You do a song for Cora and there is a spot for you in the Magic Kingdom, baby."
00:13:23.302,00:13:26.013,Writing a song. I thought I was done with that whole nightmare.
00:13:26.097,00:13:28.557,Just one song. That's all we need. One song.
00:13:29.016,00:13:30.684,But it's so...
00:13:31.936,00:13:33.437,"Time-consuming, you know?"
00:13:35.564,00:13:37.566,And I haven't written for 10 years.
00:13:37.649,00:13:40.903,And I need a lyricist. And it's never worked with anyone except Colin.
00:13:41.070,00:13:47.576,"All right, look, I know it's not easy to get somebody good this fast, okay, but there is this guy. Supposedly he's very hip, very edgy."
00:13:47.659,00:13:49.703,He just worked with Avril.
00:13:53.665,00:13:54.959,Ah.
00:13:55.126,00:13:56.252,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
00:13:56.335,00:13:57.879,I'm just a little bit blocked here at the moment.
00:13:57.962,00:14:00.339,"Look, if you don't like the lyrics, be straight with me, dude."
00:14:00.714,00:14:03.259,"No, no, no, no. The lyrics are very, very powerful."
00:14:03.675,00:14:07.013,Maybe you want something more commercial? More PoP-y?
00:14:08.264,00:14:10.933,Just hold that thinly veiled insult for one second.
00:14:16.522,00:14:17.731,-Hello. -Hey.
00:14:17.814,00:14:21.610,"-Uh, Khan said I could just come up? -They were able to save the whole hand."
00:14:21.693,00:14:24.780,I know. I made too big a deal out of it.
00:14:24.864,00:14:28.409,"It's just that I hate infections. But then again, who likes them?"
00:14:28.492,00:14:29.869,Maybe the people who make penicillin.
00:14:29.952,00:14:31.828,"Ah, yes. Well, there's two sides to every story."
00:14:31.913,00:14:33.330,That's True. Except for the Nazis.
00:14:33.414,00:14:35.749,I can't really see the other side of that argument.
00:14:35.832,00:14:37.084,Excuse me?
00:14:37.376,00:14:40.462,"I'm sorry. I didn't even see you there. Hi, I'm Sophie Fisher."
00:14:40.546,00:14:44.050,"Yeah, Sophie, this is Greg Antonsky. He's a noted lyricist."
00:14:44.550,00:14:48.720,"Really? Well, um, I don't wanna get in your way."
00:14:48.804,00:14:50.056,And I can see that I already have.
00:14:50.139,00:14:52.558,So I'm off to the kitchen. Don't tell me.
00:14:53.976,00:14:55.186,She's kind of hot.
00:14:55.519,00:14:58.105,Good. Yeah. I'm glad you enjoyed her.
00:14:59.315,00:15:00.482,"She's coming back in here, right?"
00:15:01.025,00:15:04.445,"Yeah, I would imagine so. Unless she goes directly back to the mothership."
00:15:04.778,00:15:05.779,How about...
00:15:10.201,00:15:24.423,"I look real good, but I'm a nasty bitch I can scream and claw And curdle your blood But you'll die on your way back into love No. Start on a minor third. Try that."
00:15:24.798,00:15:27.259,"Right. So, uh..."
00:15:30.304,00:15:31.847,"I look real good, but I'm a nasty..."
00:15:31.931,00:15:33.599,Come on. You're missing the point.
00:15:34.058,00:15:38.104,"From the first line. Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch is okay."
00:15:38.187,00:15:39.396,But then it should be...
00:15:39.605,00:15:50.741,"But with some magic, I just might switch Uh, sorry. What did you say?"
00:15:53.035,00:15:55.037,I don't remember.
00:15:55.871,00:15:58.707,"I think it was, But with some magic, I just might switch."
00:15:59.333,00:16:02.378,-That is actually quite intriguing. -That's not my lyric.
00:16:02.461,00:16:04.005,"No, I know, but it's a lovely phrase."
00:16:04.088,00:16:10.469,"Look, if you can't handle anything except moon and June, why don't we just let plant girl finish the lyrics?"
00:16:11.262,00:16:12.388,Plant girl.
00:16:12.638,00:16:15.141,"Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch."
00:16:15.474,00:16:18.227,"But with some magic, I just might switch. Finish it."
00:16:18.560,00:16:21.897,I'm just here to cater to the plants.
00:16:21.981,00:16:23.815,"And you are doing a fine job, if I may say so."
00:16:23.899,00:16:25.484,Although that one is plastic.
00:16:26.110,00:16:27.194,Huh? Oh.
00:16:30.822,00:16:33.284,Let's fly my broom to the stars above.
00:16:33.367,00:16:37.163,And we'll charm our way back into love.
00:16:41.667,00:16:46.172,"What's the next line, Feelings, nothing more than feelings?"
00:16:46.922,00:16:48.507,You people disgust me.
00:16:51.843,00:16:53.595,I'm sorry. I shouldn't have gotten involved.
00:16:53.679,00:16:55.264,I have no filtering system.
00:16:55.472,00:16:57.016,"No. That's fine, that's fine."
00:16:57.099,00:16:59.268,He had to get back to his job at Hallmark anyway.
00:16:59.351,00:17:01.853,"Listen, have you ever done any writing?"
00:17:02.104,00:17:05.482,"I mean, everybody's done some writing, you know? Well, not everybody."
00:17:05.566,00:17:07.526,Illiteracy is a growing epidemic in this country.
00:17:07.609,00:17:11.697,"I write slogans for Weight-Not, this weight-reduction company that my sister runs."
00:17:14.866,00:17:18.495,"Yeah, of course, everybody has. My sister, Rhonda, loved them."
00:17:18.579,00:17:22.333,They had that ridiculous hair and those ridiculous outfits and...
00:17:22.416,00:17:23.792,"Oh, my God, you're one of them."
00:17:25.044,00:17:27.088,That hair was actually very much in style then.
00:17:27.213,00:17:28.964,"-I'm very sorry. -Yeah, that's fine."
00:17:29.048,00:17:32.218,But I would love to talk to you about maybe writing some lyrics.
00:17:32.968,00:17:34.010,But I don't write lyrics.
00:17:34.261,00:17:37.223,"Well, we could just kick some ideas around, repot the ficus."
00:17:37.306,00:17:39.558,"I don't think so. I appreciate the offer, though."
00:17:39.641,00:17:42.311,"I have to go babysit for my sister now. I mean, her kids."
00:17:42.394,00:17:45.897,"She's 38 now, so. Thank you."
00:17:49.068,00:17:51.070,"Okay, listen. Do you know who Cora Corman is?"
00:17:51.153,00:17:52.988,"Oh, yeah. My niece loves her."
00:17:53.072,00:18:00.371,"Okay, well, I'm writing a song for her, so if you change your mind and the idea of working with me is of any interest at all, -please just call, okay? -Oh, okay, well..."
00:18:00.454,00:18:02.956,"Or if you just fancy a good laugh, I am performing at the Hilton tonight."
00:18:04.125,00:18:07.378,"Well, thank you. I mean, but I can't, you know. I'm sorry."
00:18:07.461,00:18:10.339,"I just can't, she says mysteriously. But I just can't."
00:18:10.422,00:18:12.091,-I'm sorry. Thank you for the offer. -Yes.
00:18:18.013,00:18:20.141,"Oh, my God."
00:18:21.183,00:18:22.684,"Go to the next level, weirdo."
00:18:22.768,00:18:24.270,You have to go to the next level.
00:18:26.188,00:18:29.108,It's your parents. Go get into bed. Get into bed. This is not a drill.
00:18:29.191,00:18:31.110,LUCY: But we haven't even brushed our teeth.
00:18:31.193,00:18:33.112,Get in there. Get in there. Get into bed.
00:18:34.280,00:18:35.281,-Hey. -Hi.
00:18:35.364,00:18:36.990,-How was the movie? -I enjoyed it.
00:18:37.073,00:18:39.243,-He fell asleep. -I enjoy sleeping.
00:18:39.326,00:18:41.120,-How was dinner? -Really nice place.
00:18:41.203,00:18:44.123,"You know, it's really hard to enjoy dinner when you run a weight-loss center."
00:18:44.206,00:18:47.209,"-If I get fat, there goes my fiscal year. -Honey, you're not fat."
00:18:47.293,00:18:50.546,"Well, you're not about to open a branch in Boca. But thank you, sweetie."
00:18:50.629,00:18:52.881,"-So how'd everything go here? -Oh, yeah. Good. Great."
00:18:52.964,00:18:54.258,The kids ate and went to sleep.
00:18:57.553,00:19:00.389,"Yeah, it... They're really bad children."
00:19:01.223,00:19:04.768,"Okay, okay. Everybody goes to bed. I'm sending your father in there."
00:19:05.144,00:19:08.147,"LUCY: Whoa, we're so scared."
00:19:09.356,00:19:10.566,And then I'm coming in.
00:19:13.194,00:19:15.154,I'll just go check to make sure they're still breathing.
00:19:16.738,00:19:19.908,"Hey, wanna do some stress eating? Just a piece of diet cheesecake."
00:19:19.991,00:19:22.828,This thing happened to me today... I don't know. I'm just gonna go home.
00:19:22.911,00:19:24.163,You seem so jumpy tonight.
00:19:24.246,00:19:27.249,"Oh, you know, I feel a little guilty about something."
00:19:27.333,00:19:28.459,How unusual for you.
00:19:28.917,00:19:30.752,"Okay, listen. I have to tell you."
00:19:30.836,00:19:34.840,I met that guy from that band you used to like. Alex Fletcher from PoP?
00:19:34.923,00:19:36.091,"Oh, my God."
00:19:36.175,00:19:37.926,"Anyway, I do Jane's plant service."
00:19:38.009,00:19:39.928,"You know, I'm taking over for her while she's gone."
00:19:40.011,00:19:42.556,"And anyway, she does his apartment, so I was there."
00:19:42.639,00:19:44.140,"Actually, it was the second time."
00:19:44.225,00:19:46.643,And he invited me to come see him perform tonight.
00:19:46.727,00:19:48.687,"Gary, I'm going out!"
00:19:48.770,00:19:52.274,"Oh, my God. I love him. I love him. I love him. I love him."
00:19:54.025,00:19:57.279,-That really wasn't the end of the story. -Come on. Help me dress.
00:19:57.363,00:19:58.905,Should I wear the red one?
00:20:25.557,00:21:16.400,"Out of the corner of my eye I felt a connection I don't know how I don't know why I shouldn't have stayed When I saw you there With another man But as we slipped away I thought I heard you say This wasn't part of the plan Just a meaningless kiss It wasn't supposed to end up like this Just a meaningless kiss ALL: Oh, oh, oh Just a meaningless kiss We knew it was wrong But we couldn't resist Just a meaningless kiss Till I fell in love with you Girls, tell me the truth. Are these pants too tight?"
00:21:19.403,00:21:20.779,"Oh, my God, I gotta get up there."
00:21:20.946,00:22:43.695,And here we are two years later Too late to turn back now We've gotta finish What we shouldn't have started But it's easier said than done When two hearts beat as one And three hearts are one too many That's why we shouldn't have ever begun Just a meaningless kiss We knew it was wrong But we couldn't resist Just a meaningless kiss Till I fell in love with you We can't go on like this forever When we're not meant to be together So leave me here on my own From now on I guess I've got to dance alone It wasn't supposed to end up like this FAN 1: Alex! FAN 2: Alex!
00:22:43.904,00:22:45.447,"-Hello. -WOMAN: Alex, I'm Barbara."
00:22:45.531,00:22:48.033,"In Boston, in 1989, I came back to your hotel."
00:22:48.116,00:22:51.495,"CHRIS: If you wanna see Alex again, check his website for the tour schedule."
00:22:51.620,00:22:55.499,"And, uh, the Knott's Berry Farm show is temporarily postponed, okay?"
00:22:55.624,00:22:58.794,"Great show, huh? They love you. They're hot for you."
00:22:58.877,00:23:02.047,"Of course, they're also hot because so many of them are going through menopause."
00:23:02.130,00:23:06.635,Wait a minute. Barbara from Boston. From Boston.
00:23:06.718,00:23:09.513,I do remember that Barbara. I do. I'm going back for one second.
00:23:09.596,00:23:12.849,"No, no, no. That's how we wind up getting chased by angry husbands."
00:23:12.933,00:23:14.976,-Not necessarily. She... -Hi.
00:23:15.393,00:23:16.603,"Well, hi."
00:23:17.062,00:23:20.482,"Hello. Hello, hello. Very good news. Yes."
00:23:20.566,00:23:21.983,"Chris, you remember Sophie?"
00:23:22.067,00:23:23.569,Planted in my memory.
00:23:24.611,00:23:28.907,"Um, I just wanted to apologize for being so cryptic earlier."
00:23:28.990,00:23:30.451,"This is my sister, Rhonda."
00:23:32.453,00:23:34.455,I'm sorry. I've...
00:23:34.538,00:23:38.083,"-You were so great tonight. -We've met, haven't we? Right?"
00:23:40.544,00:23:42.504,"I know. Anyway, could I get a quick autograph?"
00:23:42.588,00:23:43.839,"You may, Rhonda."
00:23:43.922,00:23:45.507,"RHONDA: Could I get a quick picture with you, too?"
00:23:45.591,00:23:46.633,Only if you're single.
00:23:46.717,00:23:49.427,"Well, I've been married 16 years, but nothing's written in stone, right?"
00:23:49.511,00:23:50.887,-Could you scootch? Thanks. -Okay.
00:23:50.971,00:23:53.599,"Also, I really wanted to thank you for your offer."
00:23:53.682,00:23:54.683,What offer?
00:23:54.766,00:23:56.309,"Okay. While Greg, the rhyming psychopath..."
00:23:56.392,00:23:57.478,"Thanks again for him, by the way."
00:23:57.561,00:24:00.897,"...was in my apartment, Sophie spouted some really interesting lyrics."
00:24:00.981,00:24:02.315,I thought she was doing plants.
00:24:02.398,00:24:03.734,I'm holding a pose here.
00:24:03.817,00:24:09.573,"-I appreciate it, but, uh... -The truth is, I need a song by Friday and it is amazingly difficult to find a sane lyricist."
00:24:09.698,00:24:11.825,Why don't you just write the lyrics yourself?
00:24:11.950,00:24:13.660,"You know, that's really not a strength of his."
00:24:13.744,00:24:14.911,That's absolutely right.
00:24:14.995,00:24:16.913,I once rhymed you and me with autopsy.
00:24:17.080,00:24:18.790,"Well, that's not necessarily bad."
00:24:19.207,00:24:21.417,You could do something with that. You know?
00:24:21.502,00:24:25.964,"-Just press the button, honey. -Figuring out you and me is like doing a love autopsy."
00:24:26.047,00:24:28.925,"-You see, you see. That's quite good. -That's not bad."
00:24:29.425,00:24:33.471,-ALEX: Go on. More. How does it go? -I have no idea.
00:24:33.722,00:24:35.348,Someone could have sculpted us in this time.
00:24:35.431,00:24:37.475,"CHRIS: Hey, hey, hey, you know what? Let me take it, huh?"
00:24:37.559,00:24:40.854,They could operate all day long. And never figure out what went wrong.
00:24:41.312,00:24:44.149,"My God, you are... You are Cole Porter in panties."
00:24:44.232,00:24:47.318,"Of course, having said that, Cole Porter probably did wear panties."
00:24:47.569,00:24:50.155,"Anyway, um, thank you for inviting us."
00:24:50.697,00:24:52.032,"Okay, I'm just gonna take a real quick one."
00:24:52.115,00:24:54.993,"Let me take it. Let me take it, Sophie."
00:24:55.410,00:24:57.663,"-Thank you so much. That was great. -Hang on, one..."
00:24:57.829,00:24:59.998,RHONDA: Nice to meet you guys. Bye-bye.
00:25:06.462,00:25:07.839,"So this is where Sophie works, eh?"
00:25:07.923,00:25:09.883,Yeah. She is gonna be right out.
00:25:10.091,00:25:12.135,Excellent. Excellent. Thank you very much.
00:25:14.512,00:25:15.847,So how much do you weigh?
00:25:16.222,00:25:17.515,I fluctuate. Yeah.
00:25:17.974,00:25:19.517,"Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm."
00:25:21.645,00:25:26.567,"Okay, look, I am terribly sorry to barge in like this, but I have decided I cannot take no for an answer."
00:25:26.650,00:25:28.944,"-Look, I told you that... -I know, you're not a writer."
00:25:29.027,00:25:33.489,Except when you are writing poems and short stories in the New School literary magazine.
00:25:33.574,00:25:35.366,I googled you. And you were good.
00:25:35.450,00:25:37.118,"Look, I'm flattered."
00:25:37.243,00:25:43.333,"I mean, you're one of six people in the world who's actually read those, but that doesn't mean I can write a song."
00:25:44.209,00:25:47.796,"You already did. Five minutes, that's all I ask."
00:25:51.132,00:25:52.550,This is a treat.
00:25:53.384,00:25:55.386,"-Ah. -Ah, Mr. Fletcher. Nice to see you."
00:25:55.511,00:25:57.931,"-Very nice to see you, Mia, how are you? -Wonderful. Thank you."
00:25:58.014,00:25:59.975,I just want to get... Can I try the new Mason &amp; Hamlin?
00:26:00.058,00:26:03.937,"-Sure, absolutely. Be my guest. -Thank you very much. Thanks. Please."
00:26:04.020,00:26:05.188,"This is, uh..."
00:26:05.271,00:26:07.649,It's just a little something that you might possibly recognize.
00:26:13.363,00:26:42.934,Is like doing a love autopsy They could operate all day long And never figure out what went wrong Love autopsy Love autopsy What went wrong?
00:26:49.107,00:26:51.818,SOPHIE: God. That melody is so beautiful.
00:26:52.443,00:26:54.362,But I've never written a song.
00:26:54.445,00:26:56.782,"A song. I know, I know. And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong."
00:26:56.865,00:27:00.493,I just don't think I am. I think you may be a born lyricist.
00:27:04.080,00:27:08.584,"We don't have very long, but what I'd like to do, in an ideal world is continue with the Autopsy song."
00:27:08.669,00:27:15.008,"But I think it's gonna be very hard to get back from there into Way Back Into Love, -which is the title that Cora demands. -Uh-huh."
00:27:15.091,00:27:18.804,What we could do is continue with Greg the Angel of Death's version.
00:27:18.887,00:27:20.305,That's plagiarism.
00:27:20.388,00:27:22.683,"Yes. Yes, yes. Good. Excellent."
00:27:22.766,00:27:25.393,I would never in a million years use someone else's work.
00:27:25.476,00:27:26.853,I'm very glad you agree.
00:27:26.937,00:27:31.733,"So, what we need, we need something brand-new."
00:27:33.443,00:27:36.362,-So let's see. A song for Cora. -ALEX: Yes.
00:27:37.155,00:27:39.950,Has to be called A Way Back Into Love.
00:27:40.033,00:27:41.076,ALEX: Correct.
00:27:41.159,00:27:43.286,And it has to be something Cora would sing about.
00:27:43.619,00:27:44.788,Good.
00:27:44.871,00:27:46.873,And it has to be something you would sing about.
00:27:46.957,00:27:48.083,"Good, good, yeah."
00:27:48.750,00:27:51.336,"-What would you sing about? -Whatever gets me the job, really."
00:27:52.420,00:27:54.130,"Oh, that's inspiring."
00:28:00.261,00:28:04.515,"SOPHIE: Okay. Two people searching for love, for salvation."
00:28:04.850,00:28:06.226,"ALEX: Good, good, I love that."
00:28:06.309,00:28:08.686,"SOPHIE: Love lost, love found."
00:28:10.230,00:28:11.647,Love lost again.
00:28:11.732,00:28:15.026,"ALEX: Yes, this is starting to sound a little bit like luggage, but good."
00:28:34.004,00:28:35.546,Thanks. That's really helpful.
00:28:36.297,00:28:38.508,It doesn't have to be perfect. Just spit it out.
00:28:38.842,00:28:40.969,-They're just lyrics. -Just lyrics?
00:28:42.178,00:28:45.681,Lyrics are important. They're just not as important as melody.
00:28:47.225,00:28:48.769,I really don't think you get it.
00:28:49.394,00:28:51.062,"Oh, you look angry. Click your pen."
00:28:51.229,00:28:54.065,A melody is like seeing someone for the first time.
00:28:54.149,00:28:56.109,The physical attraction. Sex.
00:28:57.068,00:28:58.653,I so get that.
00:28:58.904,00:29:02.157,"But then, as you get to know the person, that's the lyrics."
00:29:02.240,00:29:04.450,Their story. Who they are underneath.
00:29:05.493,00:29:08.621,It's the combination of the two that makes it magic.
00:29:11.582,00:29:14.335,"-A walk? What, now? -Yeah."
00:29:14.585,00:29:19.257,"Out on the streets you see things and, you know, hear things and eat things."
00:29:19.340,00:29:21.134,It all sort of unlocks your mind.
00:29:26.639,00:29:28.308,This is good. This is good.
00:29:28.391,00:29:30.476,"When you hit a wall, you gotta change the subject."
00:29:30.560,00:29:32.312,So why did PoP break up?
00:29:32.395,00:29:35.065,"I mean, Rhonda told me that you guys were friends growing up?"
00:29:35.148,00:29:39.778,"We were, yes, and then Colin met a new manager, who convinced him he was the true star of the band."
00:29:39.861,00:29:47.118,"And shortly after that he left, taking with him the last three songs we'd written together and putting them on his solo album, which went on to sell a mere eight million records."
00:29:47.243,00:29:49.454,But how did you deal with that?
00:29:50.746,00:29:56.002,"Oh, with drugs, uh, alcohol and ultimately, my own solo album."
00:30:01.424,00:30:02.884,Cool.
00:30:02.968,00:30:05.011,This copy has been in the racks for six years.
00:30:05.678,00:30:07.263,"-Come on. -No, no. I check every week."
00:30:07.347,00:30:10.058,"You see, I made a little mark, just there on the back. See?"
00:30:10.141,00:30:12.936,"It sold only 50,000 copies, most of those to my mother."
00:30:13.061,00:30:18.191,"Oh, Rolling Stone called it A crass, contrived effort, not even good enough for a dentist chair."
00:30:19.818,00:30:21.945,"Well, I'm sure there were other reviews."
00:30:22.070,00:30:24.572,"There were, there were. But none as good as that one."
00:30:24.655,00:30:26.657,"And they were right, by the way. Yeah."
00:30:29.119,00:30:34.457,"To cut a long story short, I gave up trying to write, lost an incredible amount of money and then my apartment."
00:30:34.540,00:30:37.919,"Chris stuck by me, booked me an '80s reunion night on Long Island."
00:30:38.003,00:30:40.255,"And suddenly, they liked me again."
00:30:40.338,00:30:42.632,It was weird. It was like I'd never been away.
00:30:42.715,00:30:48.179,"The audience was a tad older, as was I, but we were very, very profoundly happy to see each other again."
00:30:51.307,00:30:54.895,"Cruises. Reunions. Knott's Berry Farm, which I'm sure you're familiar with."
00:30:54.978,00:30:58.398,"Busch Gardens, that's one of my big fixtures of the year."
00:30:58.481,00:31:00.275,"Uh, what else can I tell you?"
00:31:00.358,00:31:03.028,I really appreciate you opening up to me like this.
00:31:05.280,00:31:07.866,I know what it's like to live with a shadow overhead.
00:31:12.120,00:31:13.246,What?
00:31:23.256,00:31:24.883,"ALEX: Now, that's a nice melody, isn't it?"
00:31:25.633,00:31:27.468,SOPHIE: It's good. ALEX: Thank you. Thank you.
00:31:27.552,00:31:29.971,"Mind you, what do you know? You don't even like melody."
00:31:30.055,00:31:31.556,SOPHIE: I never said that.
00:31:32.182,00:31:33.391,ALEX: You prefer the lyrics.
00:31:34.100,00:31:35.310,I don't trust you.
00:31:35.393,00:31:36.644,"Your turn, what's next?"
00:31:37.603,00:31:39.940,I think that we should get some breakfast.
00:31:40.106,00:31:42.817,"Now, please, come on, we're finally on a roll here. Listen again."
00:31:47.072,00:31:52.160,"There'll be no more rhymes until I'm fed Please, seriously, seriously."
00:31:52.243,00:31:53.661,I've been living with a shadow overhead...
00:31:54.245,00:31:56.789,I could be inspired with just a piece of bread.
00:31:58.083,00:32:00.168,ALEX: I have the perfect place. SOPHIE: Wait a minute.
00:32:00.251,00:32:01.586,It's just on the next corner.
00:32:01.669,00:32:03.588,-Keep moving and keep writing. -All right.
00:32:03.671,00:32:06.925,I've been looking for someone to shed some light.
00:32:08.093,00:32:09.928,-That's good. That's good. -Yeah?
00:32:10.011,00:32:11.804,Shadows and light. You're deep.
00:32:11.887,00:32:14.640,"Okay, we need two more lines of Cora verse. What's next?"
00:32:14.724,00:32:15.808,Soph?
00:32:19.104,00:32:20.146,Sophie?
00:32:21.564,00:32:22.690,What are you doing?
00:32:23.483,00:32:24.567,Nothing.
00:32:24.985,00:32:29.072,"Uh, I thought I saw someone, but it wasn't him. So it's fine."
00:32:29.155,00:32:30.823,"SOPHIE: Oh, there he is."
00:32:31.282,00:32:32.283,ALEX: What?
00:32:32.783,00:32:35.620,"A very nice picture, though. That's funny."
00:32:36.371,00:32:39.415,"Interestingly enough, I mean... Well, it is a bookstore."
00:32:39.499,00:32:41.417,"-So, you know, that does happen. -What?"
00:32:44.254,00:32:45.671,"Gosh, where were we? Okay."
00:32:45.755,00:32:47.215,"Uh, shadow overhead."
00:32:47.298,00:32:50.885,"Okay, can I just say, with all due respect, that you are clearly..."
00:32:50.969,00:32:53.471,What is the word? Insane at this moment.
00:32:53.554,00:33:04.190,"And because, according to Chris, we have less than 36 hours before Cora goes to L.A. to do Leno, at which point my career is over, it would be infinitely better for me if you were sane. So how can I help?"
00:33:06.026,00:33:07.152,Um...
00:33:07.986,00:33:09.237,Do you know this book?
00:33:11.156,00:33:12.948,Ah... Sally Michaels?
00:33:13.033,00:33:15.326,"Yes, yes. Big bestseller. Yes."
00:33:15.660,00:33:17.703,"-Have you read it? -No, of course not."
00:33:17.787,00:33:21.832,Last book I read was The Alex Fletcher Story by the editors of Teen Dream magazine.
00:33:23.959,00:33:25.003,Why?
00:33:29.924,00:33:32.010,I'm Sally Michaels.
00:33:35.596,00:33:40.601,"SOPHIE: I saw that they were, you know, giving these courses on writing at the New School so I signed up."
00:33:40.685,00:33:45.106,And my teacher was Sloan Cates.
00:33:45.190,00:33:46.899,"Brilliant, handsome."
00:33:47.358,00:33:49.610,"The truth is, I was in love with him."
00:33:51.237,00:33:57.202,"And we began spending every minute together, which is why I was sort of surprised when his fianc√©e showed up."
00:33:58.703,00:34:04.625,"Yeah, he never mentioned that he was engaged to a history professor who was on a year-long sabbatical in Spain."
00:34:04.875,00:34:10.881,"And when she popped in for an unexpected visit, it sort of turned into a reenactment of the Inquisition."
00:34:11.549,00:34:14.009,And that... And that was that? That was the end of that?
00:34:14.094,00:34:16.512,Yeah. We never saw each other again.
00:34:16.596,00:34:19.724,"I dropped the class and a year later, his new novel showed up."
00:34:20.058,00:34:21.809,The Sally What's-it novel.
00:34:22.227,00:34:29.234,The tale of a student with exalted literary aspirations who lures a brilliant writer into an affair so she can take advantage of his connections.
00:34:29.859,00:34:33.738,"But when he tries to break it off, she devotes herself to ruining his life."
00:34:34.530,00:34:36.741,"Well, I mean, that obviously wasn't you."
00:34:37.992,00:34:43.956,"Well, um, she's a lit major from Long Island, 5'4, my color hair, all my habits."
00:34:44.039,00:34:46.792,"You know, talks to herself and asks too many questions."
00:34:46.876,00:34:50.921,Her parents founded a weight-reduction company that now her sister runs.
00:34:51.922,00:34:53.133,"Well, anyway, I..."
00:34:54.634,00:34:59.972,"Since then, every time I pick up a pen, I'm haunted by those words that he wrote, you know?"
00:35:01.099,00:35:04.227,She was a brilliant mimic. You know.
00:35:04.310,00:35:09.774,"She could ape Dorothy Parker or Emily Dickinson, but stripped of someone else's literary clothes."
00:35:15.863,00:35:18.824,"First of all, you can't listen to some jerk."
00:35:19.200,00:35:20.576,He's not a jerk.
00:35:20.660,00:35:22.787,He's a National Book Award winner.
00:35:22.870,00:35:26.291,"Well, then, get the best revenge, write a hit song."
00:35:30.628,00:35:33.714,"Oh, no, of course not. Pop is just for morons. Forgot that."
00:35:33.798,00:35:36.676,"-I didn't mean anything by it. -Brain-dead, or taken too many drugs."
00:35:36.759,00:35:39.262,You know what I'd say to you and Sloan Cates?
00:35:39.345,00:35:45.143,"I'd say that, You can take all the novels in the world and not one of them will make you feel as good as fast as..."
00:35:48.146,00:35:53.693,"When it's cold outside, I've got the month of May That is real poetry. Those are real poets."
00:35:53.776,00:35:57.613,"Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, the Beatles."
00:35:58.156,00:36:01.409,Okay. What if one of your heroes came up to you and said...
00:36:02.410,00:36:08.624,"You know, Smokey, what if he said, Alex Fletcher, you are a horrible songwriter?"
00:36:08.958,00:36:10.125,How would you react?
00:36:10.210,00:36:11.377,"First of all, I do know Smokey a little bit."
00:36:11.461,00:36:13.838,He's far too nice a gentleman ever to say such a thing.
00:36:14.172,00:36:15.715,"Uh, Dylan might."
00:36:15.840,00:36:18.050,"Dylan would, actually. In fact, Dylan did."
00:36:18.176,00:36:23.181,"Dylan walks up to you and he says, You are a horrible songwriter."
00:36:24.349,00:36:27.059,-How do you react? -I would be horribly depressed.
00:36:27.142,00:36:29.520,Yes. I would. I would.
00:36:29.979,00:36:40.906,"But then, after, you know, months of brooding, I would find a lyricist and write a song about how horribly depressed I was."
00:36:40.990,00:36:43.993,"It would be a big hit, everyone would love me, and I'd make lots of money."
00:36:44.076,00:36:55.713,"Suddenly I'd be a lot less depressed than if I just sat around being a little bit self-indulgent, letting my misery eat away at me until I'd become an emotional wreck and creatively completely moribund."
00:36:58.508,00:36:59.884,"Yes, moribund."
00:37:05.390,00:37:06.391,-Come on. -All right.
00:37:10.895,00:37:17.360,I've been sleeping with a clown above my bed -Clown is not right. What is that word? -It's Cloud.
00:37:17.443,00:37:19.111,"Well, write more clearly. How can I..."
00:37:19.194,00:37:21.364,Why would you have a clown in your bed?
00:37:21.447,00:37:22.782,"Let me tell you, it would not be the first time."
00:37:22.865,00:37:23.991,"Huh. Yeah, I'm not surprised."
00:37:24.074,00:37:26.786,"-Just write in capital letters. -Okay. Hey, why don't you write it?"
00:37:26.869,00:37:28.663,"I'm sorry, Khan. We're gonna come back in one second."
00:37:28.746,00:37:33.751,"ALEX: Yes. You dictate, I'll write. And I will write like a human and not like a small Pekingese dog."
00:37:34.502,00:37:35.961,"ALEX: What are you doing, you madwoman?"
00:37:36.045,00:37:37.755,-You're destroying my apartment. -Ugh.
00:37:37.838,00:37:40.174,I can't write from across the room.
00:37:40.258,00:37:43.218,"Well, you're not writing here. Get... Get back to your corner."
00:37:43.303,00:37:44.845,I can't have you here. I'll be blocked.
00:37:44.929,00:37:47.515,-I'll be completely stuck. -So go out the other side.
00:37:47.932,00:37:49.642,I've never been the other side.
00:37:51.101,00:37:53.938,"SOPHIE: Push, push. Push, push."
00:37:59.485,00:38:00.945,Good. Better.
00:38:01.946,00:38:04.990,"You're still a fraction close. Just... Just back off, just one..."
00:38:05.074,00:38:06.284,Just... Just...
00:38:06.826,00:38:08.035,"There, fine, good."
00:38:08.494,00:38:09.704,Okay.
00:38:26.261,00:38:28.222,SOPHIE: And I don't think those chords are right.
00:38:28.306,00:38:31.225,-Ugh. -It has to sound different than the verse.
00:38:31.309,00:38:34.269,"Whoa, whoa. What kind of different did you have in mind?"
00:38:34.354,00:38:37.607,"I don't know. Something sadder, you know?"
00:38:37.690,00:38:40.943,And I still don't like my line about places in my mind.
00:38:41.026,00:38:44.113,-It's fine. -Fine isn't good.
00:38:44.196,00:38:45.906,We only have time for fine.
00:38:45.990,00:38:47.116,"I'll tell you what, look."
00:38:47.199,00:38:50.411,We'll change your line about places in my mind if I can keep the chord sequence into the bridge.
00:38:50.495,00:38:52.622,-Yeah? -This isn't a negotiation.
00:38:52.705,00:38:56.041,"It's either right or wrong, inspired or insipid."
00:38:56.125,00:38:57.627,"I'll tell you what it is, it's 4:00 in the morning."
00:38:57.710,00:38:59.920,We're not writing the last movement of the Jupiter Symphony.
00:39:00.004,00:39:03.173,It's a song for someone whose last hit was called Welcome to Bootytown.
00:39:04.884,00:39:07.928,-I still don't like it. -Oh. Oh.
00:39:10.390,00:39:11.557,Ugh.
00:39:11.724,00:39:13.934,"And another thing, the whole top section..."
00:39:14.352,00:39:16.979,"I mean, it's so close. We're just not there yet."
00:39:17.062,00:39:22.485,"We just... We have to focus and stay, you know, completely understanding of what we're trying to say."
00:39:22.568,00:39:24.695,"Okay, you may now start killing the next one."
00:39:33.413,00:39:50.555,"Bum, bah, bah, bah, bah, bum, bum, bah, bah, bah, bah I can't make it through without a way back into love Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh You know, I'm tone-deaf."
00:40:15.162,00:40:17.915,ALEX: Just keep writing. Cora is leaving in an hour.
00:40:44.484,00:40:48.779,"Listen, I was thinking that corners was such a better word than spaces."
00:40:48.863,00:40:51.532,"For in the mind. The corners of my mind, rather than the spaces."
00:40:51.616,00:40:55.495,"It just seems to have a better boundary to it, you know?"
00:40:55.578,00:40:57.955,Should I speak to you about this later? Okay.
00:41:13.554,00:41:14.847,Vocals.
00:41:14.930,00:41:17.307,"No, no, you see, you have to sing into the microphone."
00:41:17.391,00:41:18.643,It won't follow you.
00:41:18.809,00:41:21.311,-But I can't. -It's a duet for a man and a woman.
00:41:21.395,00:41:22.730,We are as close as we've got.
00:41:22.813,00:41:24.982,Your headphones and a level.
00:41:25.065,00:41:26.901,You look nice in those. You should wear them all the time.
00:41:26.984,00:41:29.570,ALEX: How is that? Yes?
00:41:32.364,00:41:33.407,It's okay.
00:41:33.783,00:41:35.159,And...
00:41:37.703,00:41:39.622,Way Back Into Love. Take one. Ahem.
00:41:40.873,00:41:43.167,"Oh, God. I'm getting really nervous."
00:41:43.250,00:41:47.588,You'll be fine. Just use your normal nice voice that I've heard so much of in the last three days.
00:41:47.672,00:41:50.716,It's like my throat's closing up. It's like anaphylactic.
00:42:02.687,00:42:04.146,I've been sleeping with a...
00:42:04.229,00:42:07.024,"Just a little bit louder, 'cause this song is intended for humans. Okay?"
00:42:07.567,00:42:09.193,Way Back Into Love. Take two.
00:42:18.368,00:43:12.381,"I've been sleeping with a cloud above my bed I've been lonely for so long Trapped in the past I just can't seem to move on I've been hiding all my hopes and dreams away Just in case I ever need 'em again someday I've been setting aside time To clear a little space in the corners of my mind BOTH: All I wanna do Is find a way back into love I can't make it through without a way back into love Hey, hey! Taxi! She's gonna have a baby!"
00:43:12.464,00:43:14.258,"Hey, what if that were true?"
00:43:14.759,00:43:15.926,Another one.
00:43:16.010,00:43:46.498,"SOPHIE: I've been watching but the stars refuse to shine I've been searching but I just don't see the signs I know that it's out there There's gotta be something for my soul somewhere ALEX: I've been looking for someone to shed some light Not somebody just to get me through the night SOPHIE: Oh, my God. It's Cora. ALEX: Okay, stay calm."
00:43:46.581,00:43:48.709,"-C, you remember Alex Fletcher. -ALEX: How are you, C?"
00:43:48.793,00:43:50.836,"-CORA: Hi, Alex. -Sophie Fisher, my lyricist."
00:43:50.920,00:43:53.047,"Hi. Aspiring lyricist, actually."
00:43:53.130,00:43:54.757,So Ray tells me you have a song.
00:43:55.925,00:43:58.343,"We do. A little ditty. It's just a rough, uh..."
00:43:59.136,00:44:01.305,"Yeah, go ahead, take it. Help yourself."
00:44:02.306,00:44:03.515,"Oh, we're gonna do it now?"
00:44:07.853,00:44:11.190,Very rough. Just put together in my little studio.
00:44:11.273,00:44:12.399,Both of us singing.
00:44:12.482,00:44:14.151,"She's gonna hear my voice, it's gonna ruin it."
00:44:14.234,00:44:15.903,It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine.
00:44:20.991,00:44:23.285,"So, anyone see Battle of the '80s Has-Beens the other night?"
00:44:23.368,00:44:25.579,"That Debbie Gibson, she can take a punch, huh?"
00:44:29.499,00:44:30.668,Huh?
00:44:31.501,00:44:32.837,I didn't see it.
00:45:21.969,00:45:24.972,This is the song I've been looking for. I can't wait to work on it.
00:45:25.055,00:45:27.307,"RAY: Congratulations, guys. We gotta book."
00:45:27.391,00:45:29.852,Thanks so much. Looking forward to working with you guys.
00:45:29.935,00:45:31.311,Congratulations.
00:45:31.395,00:45:33.105,RAY: D Money! MAN: Let's go home.
00:45:33.188,00:45:34.273,"PILOT: This way, folks."
00:45:37.734,00:45:39.028,I thank you. Thank you.
00:45:41.321,00:45:43.657,"I thank you, I thank you!"
00:45:45.450,00:45:46.743,Ah!
00:45:47.286,00:45:49.955,"Yes? Chris, she loved it!"
00:45:50.039,00:45:51.415,Unbelievable!
00:45:52.041,00:45:53.583,Definitely. Where are you?
00:45:54.543,00:45:55.752,"Okay, got it. Got it."
00:45:56.211,00:45:57.337,We're going to dinner. Come on.
00:46:00.090,00:46:04.678,"To Sophie Fisher, the woman who paved my way back to Knott's Berry Farm."
00:46:05.429,00:46:07.014,"Gloria, I love your dress."
00:46:07.097,00:46:09.850,"Oh, thank you. It's nice to clean up after a day of work."
00:46:09.934,00:46:11.476,Yeah. Where do you work?
00:46:11.560,00:46:13.562,I'm a therapist at Columbia-Presbyterian.
00:46:13.687,00:46:16.398,"At the moment, I'm working on a study examining the relationship..."
00:46:16.481,00:46:17.732,"Oh, my God."
00:46:17.817,00:46:19.860,"SLOAN: That's a strike against us, right? I mean..."
00:46:20.527,00:46:22.822,What is it? What?
00:46:29.078,00:46:31.663,"Mr. Cates, good evening. How are you? Nice to see you."
00:46:31.831,00:46:33.665,I'd say about two minutes.
00:46:36.126,00:46:38.670,"MAN 1: Hi, how you doing? MAN 2: Here it comes."
00:46:40.130,00:46:41.506,SLOAN: Here's the thing...
00:46:47.429,00:46:48.597,SOPHIE: Oh!
00:46:56.856,00:46:57.982,Is she all right?
00:46:58.815,00:47:03.237,"Uh... Yeah, she always does this. It's her way of working up an appetite."
00:47:03.320,00:47:04.404,Hang on.
00:47:10.911,00:47:12.997,Hello? Sophie?
00:47:13.080,00:47:14.581,SOPHIE: He's at the bar.
00:47:14.664,00:47:17.126,I know. I know. I know. I saw him. I saw him.
00:47:17.626,00:47:19.378,"He's not that great, you know."
00:47:19.461,00:47:20.963,I saw the beginnings of a bald patch.
00:47:21.046,00:47:23.966,"-Why, come and have a look. -Oh, he has a great head of hair."
00:47:26.010,00:47:28.178,I think I'll just stay in here until he leaves.
00:47:28.262,00:47:30.472,Maybe you could send in a salad and an iced tea?
00:47:30.973,00:47:32.224,Right. I'll get the waiter.
00:47:32.307,00:47:34.268,Would you like to see the dessert cart as well?
00:47:34.351,00:47:35.727,"Look, this is ridiculous."
00:47:37.437,00:47:39.481,"SOPHIE: I've been dreaming about confronting him, too."
00:47:39.564,00:47:41.775,I had a speech prepared for over a year.
00:47:43.693,00:47:44.861,Would you like to hear it?
00:47:46.571,00:47:47.822,"Very, very much."
00:47:49.658,00:47:50.867,Hello there. Good evening.
00:47:54.871,00:48:01.253,"Sloan, even though Sally Michaels only lives on paper, I live in the world."
00:48:01.336,00:48:06.425,And I can never forgive you for using me as raw material to create a fictional monster.
00:48:06.800,00:48:13.057,"Sally Michaels is my own personal ghost, a shadow hanging over each phone call and cup of iced tea."
00:48:13.140,00:48:23.067,"And one cold day, when age has robbed your mind of its fertile phrases and your hand of its dexterity, all the success won't be able to shield you from the pain you've caused and the shame you deserve."
00:48:24.068,00:48:25.569,Or something like that.
00:48:26.611,00:48:28.780,But now I know I could never actually say it to him.
00:48:28.863,00:48:30.740,"No, no, no. You have to say that."
00:48:30.824,00:48:32.326,You have to say that. You have to say it now.
00:48:32.409,00:48:34.161,Now is the perfect time. It is the perfect time.
00:48:34.244,00:48:35.329,You're on top of the world.
00:48:35.412,00:48:37.664,You just wrote a song for the biggest act in the universe.
00:48:37.747,00:48:38.999,"-But I can't. -Yeah, you can."
00:48:39.083,00:48:42.086,People wait all their lives to see an ex-lover when things are going really well.
00:48:42.169,00:48:45.047,It never happens. You can make relationship history here.
00:48:45.130,00:48:48.633,"But I can't. I mean, look at me. I haven't showered in days."
00:48:48.717,00:48:51.720,I'm covered in songwriting grime. The helicopter flew bugs in my teeth.
00:48:51.803,00:48:54.931,"Yes, yes, yes. You are a little mangy. Uh..."
00:48:56.850,00:48:58.518,Wait. Wait. Stay.
00:49:04.941,00:49:07.902,"Sorry, Gloria. Can I ask you a great favor?"
00:49:07.987,00:49:10.572,Could you accompany me to the ladies' room?
00:49:12.116,00:49:13.325,Uh...
00:49:13.450,00:49:15.244,He's a good guy. Go ahead.
00:49:16.245,00:49:17.621,-Thank you. Thanks. -Sure.
00:49:17.704,00:49:18.913,-GLORIA: Be right back. -Mmm-hmm.
00:49:27.756,00:49:30.717,-That's fantastic. -You look great.
00:49:30.800,00:49:33.053,Eleven years of therapy and I finally help someone.
00:49:33.137,00:49:35.014,"-Good luck, honey. -Thank you so much."
00:49:35.097,00:49:36.973,"Yes, thank you. Thank you, Doctor."
00:49:38.642,00:49:40.352,"-It doesn't really fit. -No, on the contrary."
00:49:40.435,00:49:42.271,-It fits you perfectly. -Really?
00:49:42.354,00:49:46.316,"Well, I'm not saying you should go to confession like that, but for what you're about to do, it's perfect."
00:49:48.818,00:49:50.029,Okay. Are you ready?
00:49:50.987,00:49:53.740,I think I'm developing a sudden coronary blockage.
00:49:53.823,00:49:55.575,"Those pass very quickly, okay?"
00:49:55.659,00:49:57.911,Shortness of breath. Blurred vision.
00:49:57.994,00:49:59.871,-You're fine. You're beautiful. -Scurvy?
00:50:00.372,00:50:01.373,"No, it's fine. You're fine."
00:50:01.456,00:50:04.709,I don't write bestsellers because I despise humanity.
00:50:04.793,00:50:08.588,"And I said, No, John, you don't write bestsellers because the feeling is mutual."
00:50:10.674,00:50:11.883,Should I have stopped?
00:50:11.966,00:50:13.802,Should I have stopped right there? Was it over?
00:50:14.719,00:50:17.764,"Hi. Sophie. My God, Sophie."
00:50:19.849,00:50:21.310,How are you?
00:50:24.521,00:50:26.356,"I'm fine, yeah. Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm."
00:50:26.440,00:50:28.024,"Good, it's great to see you."
00:50:29.068,00:50:30.610,"Alex Fletcher. Hi, how are you?"
00:50:30.694,00:50:33.029,"Hey, Alex. Sloan Cates. How are you?"
00:50:33.613,00:50:37.117,"Well, it's been an eternity. You look incredible."
00:50:38.368,00:50:40.579,"Then you were always mysteriously seductive, weren't you?"
00:50:42.872,00:50:45.209,She is writing a song for Cora Corman.
00:50:46.585,00:50:47.877,What? No.
00:50:48.337,00:50:50.214,Wait. You're a songwriter?
00:50:50.880,00:50:52.591,I... I wrote...
00:50:53.467,00:50:55.635,Brilliant lyrics. Fantastic lyrics.
00:50:55.719,00:50:57.971,"A lot of people are talking about them, actually. Mmm-hmm."
00:50:58.054,00:51:01.015,"I had a pen, a paper and wrote..."
00:51:03.643,00:51:09.816,"Sloan, the thing is, even though Sally Michaels only lives on paper, Sophie lives in the real world."
00:51:09.899,00:51:13.737,"-And she can never forgive you... -Mr. Cates, -your table's ready. -Oh, great. Thanks, Stefan."
00:51:13.820,00:51:16.072,"Listen, I'll be right there, guys. I'm sorry."
00:51:17.407,00:51:20.494,They're throwing this little dinner thing for me.
00:51:20.577,00:51:25.499,It's crazy how lavish people get no matter how cheap they are -when Hollywood comes calling. -Hollywood.
00:51:25.582,00:51:26.666,I've completely sold out.
00:51:26.750,00:51:28.084,They're making a film out of Sally Michaels.
00:51:28.168,00:51:29.628,-Really? -Yeah.
00:51:29.711,00:51:31.921,It's been crazy. I wrote the script.
00:51:32.005,00:51:34.174,We're seeing actresses. It's been... You know.
00:51:35.425,00:51:38.220,"But listen, it's great seeing you. Let's get together, okay?"
00:51:41.181,00:51:42.349,Take care of yourself.
00:51:45.310,00:51:46.436,"Take care, Allen."
00:51:51.941,00:51:53.067,Well...
00:51:54.110,00:51:56.155,Must feel good to get that over with.
00:52:00.909,00:52:02.369,I just wanna go home.
00:52:02.452,00:52:04.246,Okay. Okay. Okay.
00:52:04.871,00:52:07.416,Hang on. Just hang on one second. One second.
00:52:09.209,00:52:11.420,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry to bother you.
00:52:11.503,00:52:14.756,It would mean the world if you'd just let her say what she came to say.
00:52:14.839,00:52:16.758,"Yeah, I know what she came here to say, okay?"
00:52:16.841,00:52:21.388,"Some sad little story about how I ruined her life, while the truth is..."
00:52:24.224,00:52:27.143,"...that she seduced me so that I'd help get her published, okay?"
00:52:27.352,00:52:30.272,"Oh, come on. You were engaged and you never even told her."
00:52:30.980,00:52:33.192,I'd say we're done talking.
00:52:33.275,00:52:34.818,Bye-bye.
00:52:36.486,00:52:37.529,So...
00:52:44.244,00:52:46.955,Do me a favor. Why don't you just shove off?
00:52:47.038,00:52:51.000,"Uh, I appreciate your request, but why don't you just shove off?"
00:52:51.084,00:52:52.168,"Take it easy, my friend."
00:52:52.252,00:52:54.254,-I don't believe I will take it easy. -WOMAN: Ah!
00:52:55.672,00:52:57.216,All right. All right!
00:52:57.841,00:52:59.509,CHRIS: Don't hurt his hair.
00:53:02.429,00:53:04.639,ALEX: I'm giving up. My face is in the butter.
00:53:11.104,00:53:12.814,"-Are you okay? -Yeah, yeah, I'm fine."
00:53:12.897,00:53:16.526,It's just my PoP hip. It comes from years of doing our patented dance move.
00:53:16.610,00:53:18.737,"My God, I've suffered for my art."
00:53:18.945,00:53:20.822,"No, the thing that really hurts is my upper gum."
00:53:20.905,00:53:23.199,I think I may have impaled myself on a dinner roll.
00:53:23.533,00:53:25.118,It's a very good thing they didn't have breadsticks.
00:53:25.201,00:53:26.370,I could've lost an eye.
00:53:26.453,00:53:28.997,"Well, you should get some ice on that."
00:53:29.080,00:53:30.665,Only if it's attached to some whiskey.
00:53:31.333,00:53:34.544,"Oh, God. I can't believe you convinced me to do that."
00:53:34.669,00:53:37.171,Now I'm more of a joke to him than ever.
00:53:37.839,00:53:42.969,"And to top it off, I'll have my own personal nightmare playing on 3,000 screens."
00:53:43.052,00:53:45.013,And you know what the worst part is?
00:53:45.096,00:53:47.557,Uh... You stole some poor woman's dress?
00:53:48.182,00:53:52.312,The worst part is that he still has some kind of power over me.
00:53:52.396,00:53:54.439,I still care what he thinks.
00:53:54.773,00:53:57.191,"I'm sorry, but how?"
00:53:57.317,00:54:01.363,How can that possibly be? The guy is a jerk.
00:54:03.114,00:54:04.658,"Well, that's easy for you to say, but..."
00:54:04.824,00:54:06.868,"No, no! He is a jerk. He is a jerk. It's not a question."
00:54:06.951,00:54:08.244,-He is a jerk. -But...
00:54:08.328,00:54:11.415,"No, he is, he's a jerk. He's a jerk. Okay, here's what I think."
00:54:11.498,00:54:18.422,I think that the truth is that you are terrified of losing Sally Michaels because you'd have nothing to hide behind and you'd have to stand on your own two feet.
00:54:18.505,00:54:19.506,There.
00:54:22.384,00:54:26.095,Wow. I didn't see that comin'.
00:54:26.596,00:54:28.097,"No, well..."
00:54:28.640,00:54:30.475,I have amazing insight.
00:54:30.559,00:54:33.269,"I would use it on myself, only I don't have any problems."
00:54:34.771,00:54:36.690,And I will tell you my other insight.
00:54:36.773,00:54:44.448,I think you are way too talented and gifted and unusual to let anyone keep you from standing.
00:54:49.578,00:54:52.331,"That's wonderfully sensitive, Alex."
00:54:52.414,00:54:54.916,Especially from a man who wears such tight pants.
00:54:55.792,00:54:58.002,It forces all the blood to my heart.
00:55:07.053,00:55:08.680,Listen.
00:55:09.348,00:55:11.891,You were amazing tonight.
00:55:13.142,00:55:14.644,As were you.
00:55:14.728,00:55:17.397,The few syllables you got out were absolutely devastating.
00:55:23.111,00:55:24.654,Does this feel any better?
00:55:25.154,00:55:27.156,It would if it was on the right side.
00:55:40.169,00:55:41.838,And that...
00:55:43.423,00:55:44.966,Felt much better.
00:56:17.081,00:56:18.374,SOPHIE: Mmm.
00:56:19.584,00:56:20.669,ALEX: Oh.
00:56:45.902,00:56:47.654,How's my hit songwriter?
00:56:47.737,00:56:49.531,"Um, hang on. Just... Just hang on."
00:56:53.201,00:56:54.202,Hello?
00:56:54.994,00:56:56.580,I have a strange situation here.
00:56:56.996,00:56:59.248,"Oh, you've got a strange situation?"
00:56:59.332,00:57:03.336,I'm at Beth's soccer game with my ex-wife who's here with my ex-gardener.
00:57:03.962,00:57:05.672,They came on a riding mower.
00:57:06.297,00:57:07.507,I slept with Sophie.
00:57:10.677,00:57:12.887,"Yeah, remember your blood pressure. You're a tall man."
00:57:12.971,00:57:14.097,You need all the pressure you can get.
00:57:17.559,00:57:21.521,"Unless, of course, you're happy about it, then I couldn't be more pleased for you."
00:57:21.605,00:57:23.732,-Should we do pros and cons? -ALEX: Not necessary.
00:57:25.525,00:57:27.777,"-I think she's up. I gotta go. -Remember, we got a show today."
00:57:27.944,00:57:30.447,"2:00. Listen, I'm gonna pick you up in a little while."
00:57:30.530,00:57:33.199,I want you to wear the white shirt with the fan-friendly pants.
00:57:33.282,00:57:34.408,-I'm... I'm going. -Listen to me...
00:57:34.493,00:57:35.702,Too much. Too much. Hanging up on you.
00:57:37.704,00:57:38.747,Good morning.
00:57:40.081,00:57:42.542,-Hi. -That was Chris just checking in.
00:57:43.585,00:57:48.882,So I'm gonna help clean up a little bit seeing as we don't have any work today.
00:57:49.674,00:57:51.134,"Right. Fine. Thank you. Well, very nice of you."
00:57:52.093,00:57:55.514,"I mean, I would obviously invite you to stay, it's just that I actually have a show to do today."
00:57:56.139,00:57:58.600,"-Oh, really? -Oh, yes. A big one."
00:57:58.683,00:58:03.480,"I'm headlining at Adventureland Amusement Park, Long Island's family fun center."
00:58:03.563,00:58:05.899,Biggest outdoor amusement center east of Rye Playland.
00:58:07.484,00:58:08.860,Sounds great.
00:58:09.486,00:58:11.821,-Okay. -Yeah.
00:58:11.905,00:58:13.657,-So. -So.
00:58:15.784,00:58:17.326,"I mean, you..."
00:58:19.579,00:58:20.580,You could come.
00:58:33.259,00:58:57.241,-But then pop goes my heart -Pop goes my heart I wasn't gonna fall in love again But then pop goes my heart Pop goes my heart I can't lose this feeling Okay. Let's hear everyone clapping.
00:58:59.077,00:59:03.289,"Hey, come on. These guys over here on line at the Little Dipper, let's hear you clapping."
00:59:06.167,00:59:07.794,Don't... Don't if you don't want to.
00:59:08.211,00:59:37.657,"A twist of fate makes life worthwhile You are gold and silver I said I wasn't gonna lose my head -But then pop goes my heart -Pop goes my heart And I just can't let you go Thank you very much. Thank you, Adventureland. Thank you."
00:59:38.700,00:59:40.702,Thank you.
00:59:41.828,00:59:44.372,SOPHIE: That was great. That was great.
00:59:44.664,00:59:45.832,-Yeah? -SOPHIE: Yeah.
00:59:45.915,00:59:47.000,Ah.
00:59:47.083,00:59:49.418,"Good show. All right, you gotta do the encore."
00:59:49.586,00:59:53.089,"-Mmm, do I really have to? -It's in the contract."
00:59:53.757,00:59:55.717,You wanna do Meaningless Kiss or Dance With Me Tonight?
00:59:56.718,00:59:58.678,This is embarrassing. They don't want it.
00:59:59.095,01:00:01.430,"No, it's not. These songs, they're fantastic."
01:00:02.306,01:00:11.190,"I mean, I've never heard most of them before, but they're full of wonderful melodic surprises and they're catchy and they're making people happy and they're just good."
01:00:11.274,01:00:13.484,So you should be incredibly proud to sing them.
01:00:15.612,01:00:18.615,You're not just saying that because you've been on the wave ride three times.
01:00:18.782,01:00:21.242,"They're good, really good."
01:00:25.163,01:00:27.957,"Uh, okay, then. Dance With Me Tonight, please."
01:00:29.167,01:00:39.510,It's not often one grown man gets to say that to another Thank you.
01:00:41.638,01:00:44.140,Okay. PoP face.
01:01:07.664,01:01:58.965,Since I've known right from wrong Got no job Sometimes I just sit down and sob Wondering if anything will go right Or will you dance with me tonight When the sun departs I feel a hole down in my heart Put on some shoes Come down here and listen to the blues Wondering if anything will go right Or will you dance with me tonight I'm looking at you You're looking at me We're the only two off the dance floor Do you see what I see?
01:01:59.173,01:02:13.229,Two broken lives Working in harmony Might make for a decent time So get up and dance with me CHRIS: It was a great show. You should be very pleased.
01:02:13.562,01:02:15.189,How much money did we make?
01:02:15.273,01:02:18.442,I don't talk business in front of a non-client. You know that.
01:02:18.567,01:02:20.987,"Actually, I'm thinking about signing with you."
01:02:21.821,01:02:25.699,"Well, well, thank you, Sophie. That's... That's terrific."
01:02:25.784,01:02:32.331,"In that case, I don't think it's right to talk about one client's business affairs in front of another client. I'm very discreet that way."
01:02:32.415,01:02:35.543,"You don't know how much money we made, do you?"
01:02:36.210,01:02:37.586,I have a ballpark figure.
01:02:37.837,01:02:38.963,ALEX: Is it enough for a nice dinner?
01:02:42.508,01:02:44.385,"Oh, God, help. Uh..."
01:02:44.510,01:02:47.931,"You know, she wouldn't yell at me if, uh, if you came."
01:02:50.850,01:02:51.935,"Oh, very well."
01:02:55.604,01:02:56.647,I can't go.
01:03:07.200,01:03:09.368,Oh. There you go. You're gonna love these.
01:03:09.452,01:03:10.954,Thank you. That's plenty. Honestly.
01:03:11.037,01:03:13.790,"Trust me, you're gonna want even more than that. Say when."
01:03:13.873,01:03:15.374,"ALEX: Oh, when, when, when. Thank you."
01:03:15.458,01:03:17.335,"Oh, thank you. That's plenty. Thank you."
01:03:17.418,01:03:18.795,-One more. Trust me. -No.
01:03:18.878,01:03:21.297,"Listen, now, I don't wanna be presumptuous, but..."
01:03:21.547,01:03:26.970,I'm about to open a new Weight-Not in Boca and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to perform.
01:03:27.053,01:03:30.348,Sounds wonderful. I performed at a fat farm once. They loved me.
01:03:30.431,01:03:32.809,I threw out little treats from the stage. They went crazy.
01:03:32.892,01:03:34.352,It was like a dietetic Altamont.
01:03:36.855,01:03:39.273,"RHONDA: That's funny. No, no, no, honey, no cell phones at the table."
01:03:39.357,01:03:40.691,"Could be Jessie, calling about the meeting."
01:03:40.817,01:03:42.068,"If we break the rules, what'll the kids think?"
01:03:42.151,01:03:44.445,"Don't do it. I'm sorry, Alex. Very rude."
01:03:44.528,01:03:47.531,"Weirdo, is there a way we could go to the Cora show?"
01:03:48.032,01:03:50.326,"-That would be so cool. -Yeah, we could work that out."
01:03:50.409,01:03:51.911,-I believe we can. -RHONDA: Kids.
01:03:51.995,01:03:52.996,We've become very close friends.
01:03:53.079,01:03:54.580,"Please don't bug him with stuff like that, okay?"
01:03:57.083,01:03:58.376,I know the rules. Turn it off.
01:03:58.459,01:04:01.254,"Oh, no, no, honey. You go right ahead. You're a guest."
01:04:01.337,01:04:02.505,-You sure? -Mmm-hmm.
01:04:02.588,01:04:04.423,You want me to call Jessie back while I'm...
01:04:04.507,01:04:06.843,"ALEX: I'll be very quick. Chris, yes?"
01:04:07.051,01:04:09.178,Say that again. Cora's people what?
01:04:09.262,01:04:10.930,What? Is it about the song?
01:04:11.139,01:04:12.223,ALEX: Really?
01:04:12.515,01:04:14.017,"-What does he say? -Yeah, no, it's Sophie."
01:04:14.683,01:04:16.019,ALEX: Really?
01:04:16.810,01:04:19.022,"Okay. Okay, got it."
01:04:19.522,01:04:24.152,Cora is back in town tomorrow and wants to meet us at her studio to work on the song.
01:04:24.861,01:04:28.072,"And, um, she wants to know if we like wheatgrass."
01:04:28.156,01:04:30.324,-SOPHIE: Sounds ominous. -Are you worried?
01:04:30.408,01:04:31.617,"Well, I don't... You know, yeah."
01:04:31.700,01:04:33.077,"ALEX: If you're not worried, I'm not worried."
01:04:33.161,01:04:35.204,-SOPHIE: No... -You've got your worried eyes.
01:04:35.288,01:04:37.373,-Well... -You look like a little worried doggy.
01:04:52.638,01:04:54.057,So...
01:04:56.517,01:04:59.103,"ALEX: Okay, honey. You lead, I'll follow."
01:05:05.026,01:05:07.695,-What? -Nothing. Just looking.
01:05:09.447,01:05:11.740,"What? What? What, what, what?"
01:05:11.991,01:05:15.619,"-Well, look. As your older sister... -Seven years older."
01:05:15.703,01:05:18.414,"Now, that's just uncalled for. Why do you do that? It just..."
01:05:18.497,01:05:19.958,"-It hurts, you know? -Mmm. Uh-huh."
01:05:20.041,01:05:24.295,"Look. I like Alex, you know. I mean, he's Alex Fletcher! So hot."
01:05:24.378,01:05:25.671,And he ate my mashed potatoes.
01:05:25.754,01:05:27.590,Yes. It was a magical evening.
01:05:27.673,01:05:29.926,"But look, hon, you don't fall a lot."
01:05:30.009,01:05:37.141,"And I've seen the way you look at him, so if you are falling for him just please, please make sure he's passionate about you."
01:05:37.391,01:05:41.812,"Well, you know, I mean, I'm not falling. We're just working together, you know?"
01:05:41.938,01:05:45.524,"And besides the one time we slept together, it's been totally professional."
01:05:45.608,01:05:47.318,-You did not. -I did.
01:05:47.401,01:05:49.278,-You slept with Alex Fletcher? -Mmm-hmm.
01:05:49.487,01:05:50.488,"Oh, my God."
01:05:56.702,01:05:59.872,"Besides, you know, how do you know who's passionate?"
01:06:01.040,01:06:02.375,Huh.
01:06:02.458,01:06:06.295,"You know, I think you... I think you just see it in their eyes."
01:06:06.379,01:06:08.381,And you feel it in their touch.
01:06:09.507,01:06:12.969,"In Gary's case, it was when he said to his mother, I'm marrying her anyway."
01:06:13.886,01:06:15.179,"God, I hate her."
01:06:16.472,01:06:19.267,I don't know. I think it's just when they do something extraordinary.
01:06:20.768,01:06:22.853,"Soph, just be careful, okay?"
01:06:23.437,01:06:24.813,Okay.
01:06:30.694,01:06:34.490,ALEX: And bigger. And bigger. And bigger. And bigger.
01:06:34.573,01:06:36.409,And bigger. And bigger.
01:06:36.492,01:06:38.286,"With claps. And bam, bam."
01:06:40.371,01:06:42.706,ALEX: Ready to spin. And...
01:06:49.380,01:06:52.008,"Well, that was fun."
01:06:52.091,01:06:54.468,"It was, it was, it was. Except for those potatoes."
01:06:54.552,01:06:56.679,It's what I imagine eating insulation would taste like.
01:06:58.264,01:07:00.849,"So, uh, Cora tomorrow?"
01:07:00.974,01:07:03.602,"Yes, tomorrow, 10:00, her studio, 19th Street."
01:07:05.438,01:07:08.149,-Should I meet you there? -That would be fine.
01:07:08.441,01:07:10.484,Although I was gonna take a cab.
01:07:10.568,01:07:14.947,"And seeing as I live just a little bit further uptown than you I could, theoretically, pick you up."
01:07:15.739,01:07:19.118,"You could if I was on the street at, say, like, 9:40."
01:07:19.202,01:07:22.496,"Then I would probably see you, depending, obviously, how brightly you were dressed."
01:07:22.705,01:07:24.707,"Well, I'd wear, like, bright orange so you couldn't miss me."
01:07:24.790,01:07:26.917,Perfect. Then you could get some road work done while you wait.
01:07:32.798,01:07:33.924,"Well, goodbye and thank you."
01:07:34.050,01:07:35.968,Thank you very much for this. I enjoyed it.
01:07:36.594,01:07:39.888,-And thank you for your support today. -Thank you. Today was great.
01:07:41.265,01:07:43.476,-It was. -Okay. Bye.
01:07:43.559,01:07:45.144,Goodbye.
01:07:52.818,01:07:53.944,-Goodbye. -Goodbye.
01:08:26.185,01:08:29.647,CORA: I want you to hear the new intro to A Way Back Into Love.
01:08:29.730,01:08:38.239,"So imagine this, instead of just starting the song with the piano, we get this heavy Indian thing going, very rhythmic."
01:08:41.784,01:08:45.788,"Derek, give me a beat, steamy and sticky."
01:09:04.014,01:09:39.800,"She's been sleeping With a cloud above her bed DEREK: Go, Cora, go, Cora Cora Corman and Alex Fletcher Got a new song that's gonna getcha Way back into love DEREK: Way back into love Way back into love You know, I think that I will get some wheatgrass after all."
01:09:43.011,01:09:45.639,"-You don't like it? -No. No, no, no, it's not that."
01:09:45.723,01:09:48.184,She had her eye on that wheatgrass since we came in.
01:09:48.267,01:09:50.186,"What you're doing, that thing there, is great."
01:09:50.269,01:09:53.981,"It's... It's steamy and it's sticky, you know."
01:09:54.064,01:09:57.193,"Which is... One is normally enough, but the combo's just amazing."
01:09:57.276,01:09:58.736,"C, time for the press shoot."
01:09:59.278,01:10:01.655,-I really like what we came up with. -Mmm.
01:10:01.739,01:10:04.867,"Oh, and add another verse. It doesn't feel like the song ends yet."
01:10:05.033,01:10:07.203,"Another verse? Right. Great. That would be an honor, C."
01:10:07.286,01:10:10.331,I'm having a little pre-recording-session party at my place.
01:10:10.414,01:10:12.124,I want you both to come.
01:10:13.083,01:10:14.084,Great.
01:10:14.210,01:10:17.213,"I think though, that, um... That there... But wait..."
01:10:17.421,01:10:19.298,"Cheers. Thanks a lot, Ray."
01:10:19.507,01:10:22.050,"-Thanks, Derek. Nice one. -Wha..."
01:10:22.134,01:10:23.886,Don't speak. Don't say anything.
01:10:26.764,01:10:30.684,"You didn't actually like that orgasm set to the Gandhi soundtrack, did you?"
01:10:30.768,01:10:33.896,"Well, I thought it was, you know, horrible."
01:10:33.979,01:10:38.150,"I mean, it simultaneously destroyed two musical cultures in under a minute."
01:10:38.234,01:10:39.360,We have to tell her.
01:10:39.443,01:10:41.153,"No, no. I don't think we do."
01:10:41.237,01:10:43.447,"Honestly, if she wants to dance, let her dance."
01:10:43.531,01:10:46.700,I don't understand. Wait. I'm sorry. I don't understand.
01:10:46.784,01:10:51.247,"Your heroes, the Beatles, Smokey, they would never let this happen."
01:10:51.330,01:10:53.332,That's a completely different thing. They were geniuses.
01:10:53.416,01:10:56.710,You know? They wrote dinner. I write dessert.
01:10:56.794,01:10:58.712,No. You're better than dessert.
01:10:58.796,01:11:01.382,And that's exactly why I'm gonna tell her what I think at the party.
01:11:01.465,01:11:03.008,"-Oh, you are not gonna do that. -Yes, I am."
01:11:03.091,01:11:04.760,"-No, you are not. -Yes, I am."
01:11:04.843,01:11:07.220,"In that case, you are no longer invited."
01:11:07.305,01:11:09.557,What? She invited me.
01:11:09.640,01:11:11.267,"She invited us, as a team."
01:11:11.350,01:11:16.439,"Now that we disagree, we no longer present a united front and are thus un-teamed for the purposes of the invitation."
01:11:17.273,01:11:18.274,So are you going?
01:11:18.357,01:11:19.775,I might drop by. I don't wanna be rude.
01:11:19.858,01:11:21.026,"Well, I don't wanna be rude either."
01:11:21.109,01:11:26.490,You don't think that going to a party and telling the hostess that she's simultaneously destroyed two musical cultures is rude?
01:11:26.574,01:11:28.033,I'm enrolling you at the nearest charm school.
01:11:28.116,01:11:31.078,I have to say what I think. I can't work this way.
01:11:31.161,01:11:34.039,What do you mean you can't work this way? You've been a songwriter for six days.
01:11:34.122,01:11:35.916,God created the universe in six days.
01:11:35.999,01:11:38.294,"And he never had a hit. Okay, he did."
01:11:38.377,01:11:40.338,"He had, He's got the whole world in..."
01:11:40.421,01:11:42.214,I'm going to the party.
01:11:42.298,01:11:45.301,"You are not going to the party. You, young lady, are grounded."
01:11:45.384,01:11:47.595,You're grounded. Come back here.
01:11:47.803,01:11:49.305,Please. I'm a little bit desperate.
01:11:49.388,01:11:51.307,-Please. -I'll see you there.
01:11:51.390,01:11:55.060,You won't. You won't because you're not invited. They won't let you in.
01:12:09.533,01:12:11.744,"-Hey, Ray. -RAY: Alex, my man."
01:12:11.952,01:12:14.330,"-How are you? Good to see you. -I'm good, man. How you doing?"
01:12:14.413,01:12:15.706,"So, you see... Is Sophie here?"
01:12:15.789,01:12:17.708,You know what? I haven't seen her.
01:12:17.791,01:12:20.002,-Uh-huh. Chris? -Yeah. Who?
01:12:20.085,01:12:22.338,"-You know, my manager. -I'm sorry. Have fun."
01:12:22.421,01:12:23.631,Yeah.
01:12:23.714,01:12:25.674,"RAY: Hey, Michelle. Good to see you, babe."
01:12:25.758,01:12:26.800,"Hey, how's it going?"
01:12:31.722,01:12:33.557,"GUEST 1: Hey, Ray, what's up, man?"
01:12:34.224,01:12:35.393,GUEST 2: How's it going?
01:13:01.126,01:13:02.378,ALEX: Hey.
01:13:02.461,01:13:03.587,-Where's Sophie? -Hang on.
01:13:04.422,01:13:06.924,"ALEX: Hang on. Oh, God, she's here. Please don't let her through."
01:13:07.007,01:13:08.050,Don't let her through.
01:13:08.258,01:13:10.886,"Listen, we cannot let her talk to Cora. She's gonna ruin everything."
01:13:10.969,01:13:12.763,-CHRIS: Who? -Sophie. She hates the song.
01:13:12.846,01:13:15.558,-She hates the song you wrote? -Yes. She hates it.
01:13:15.641,01:13:18.894,CHRIS: But she wrote the song. Why does she hate it?
01:13:19.102,01:13:21.480,ALEX: We had a little disagreement.
01:13:21.605,01:13:23.356,"Hi there, Soph, how are you?"
01:13:23.482,01:13:25.609,"-CHRIS: Hey, Sophie. -Good evening."
01:13:25.818,01:13:28.612,"So you brought something, did you, Sophie?"
01:13:28.821,01:13:35.494,"Yes. My mother told me, Never go to a party empty-handed, so I went to the Zen Eatery and got a selection of cookies. No, thank you."
01:13:42.876,01:13:45.087,Hey. It's my favorite writers.
01:13:45.295,01:13:46.505,"Hi, C. How are you?"
01:13:46.672,01:13:48.424,"We brought you some cookies, from all of us."
01:13:49.132,01:13:50.884,Thank you. Derek.
01:13:51.343,01:13:53.471,"Cora, I really wanted to talk to you..."
01:13:53.554,01:14:00.352,"About the fact that unfortunately, we're gonna have to leave early to finish the last verse of this song which has become so important to us in both an artistic and spiritual sense."
01:14:01.562,01:14:03.522,You can't leave yet. Come see the house.
01:14:03.647,01:14:05.941,I wanna show you the roof. It's upstairs.
01:14:06.984,01:14:09.277,Do you know... Well... Oh.
01:14:11.780,01:14:16.118,"Cora, I definitely see how much you've thought about the song and..."
01:14:16.201,01:14:17.703,Great roof. Really great.
01:14:17.786,01:14:19.997,"In a very interesting place as well, right at the top..."
01:14:20.080,01:14:21.957,Sophie was about to say something about our song.
01:14:22.124,01:14:23.375,Was she? I don't think she was. No.
01:14:23.459,01:14:35.137,"Somehow she looks like she's about to say something What I wanted to say is that I appreciate that you're bringing your own special thought to the music, but I really and honestly feel that we're pandering."
01:14:37.347,01:14:41.477,"Which means trying to make others like you, which I personally think is a really nice thing."
01:14:41.560,01:14:42.770,I do a lot of it myself.
01:14:42.853,01:14:44.396,"Just going out pandering, dear, I'll be back soon."
01:14:44.480,01:14:55.491,"The song is about the struggle, you know, to show your true feelings and your very confident sexual display is, you know, a total contradiction of the fear and insecurity."
01:14:55.574,01:14:57.409,"-Eh... Yes and no. -No, I don't think so."
01:14:57.493,01:14:59.495,And my fans really love it when I dance.
01:14:59.578,01:15:01.371,"-Yes, you're a wonderful dancer. -That's a fair point."
01:15:01.454,01:15:05.208,"-My last CD only went to number two. -But in this case, if you trust us..."
01:15:05.292,01:15:09.046,And Shakira is breathing down my neck. So I wanna dance.
01:15:11.173,01:15:13.383,You shall dance.
01:15:14.009,01:15:18.263,"But thank you for your honesty, Sophie. I cherish your passion."
01:15:18.471,01:15:22.518,"-Well, thank you. -Cora, Timberlake's here. Wants to say hi."
01:15:22.601,01:15:24.436,"ALEX: It's nice to see you, C. Talk to you later."
01:15:24.728,01:15:26.980,CORA: And I'm looking forward to the new last verse.
01:15:27.064,01:15:28.524,"-Cora, wait. -It's over. It's over."
01:15:28.607,01:15:30.818,"It was a very nice try, but you have hit the karmic wall."
01:15:30.901,01:15:34.237,With no help from you. You just stood there.
01:15:34.321,01:15:35.531,Talk about pandering.
01:15:35.614,01:15:38.283,I did not pander. I just told her exactly what she wanted to hear.
01:15:38.366,01:15:40.410,"-Well, I'm gonna go tell her the truth. -Well, you just did."
01:15:40.493,01:15:43.581,"What? Are you gonna use flash cards this time? My God, you're stubborn."
01:15:43.664,01:15:46.834,And you're not stubborn enough to stand up for what's good.
01:15:46.917,01:15:50.087,"I mean, I just don't wanna see you do what you did on your solo album."
01:15:50.170,01:15:51.379,"Yes, yes, yes."
01:15:53.090,01:15:55.258,I bought it. The last copy.
01:15:56.384,01:15:59.012,"All right, well, I insist on paying you back immediately."
01:15:59.096,01:16:00.430,"Um, 9.99, right? Do you have a penny?"
01:16:00.513,01:16:03.559,It's like you're trying so hard to get a hit that it wasn't you.
01:16:03.642,01:16:05.686,The songs were soulless.
01:16:05.936,01:16:08.271,"I agree. But ours has soul, so..."
01:16:08.355,01:16:12.234,But not if we ruin it. And you know that. Why are you so scared to care?
01:16:12.317,01:16:14.319,Because it won't matter.
01:16:14.402,01:16:26.039,"Because behind all her Buddhism-in-a-thong philosophy what she cares about is seats filled and units sold and nothing in the world is gonna make her your pal, any more than my years with Colin made him mine."
01:16:26.289,01:16:28.751,"Because in the end, it's all just business."
01:16:28.834,01:16:30.669,-What is? -All of it. Everything.
01:16:30.753,01:16:32.504,That's why they call it the music business.
01:16:32.588,01:16:33.672,And it's a good thing.
01:16:33.756,01:16:35.340,I actually wish everything in life was that clear.
01:16:35.423,01:16:37.509,"You know, I want something from you, you want something from me."
01:16:37.593,01:16:39.970,There's no false promises or expectations.
01:16:43.599,01:16:45.225,Well...
01:16:45.308,01:16:47.603,Congratulations on your feel-good song.
01:16:50.480,01:16:51.607,Can I get you a drink?
01:17:19.718,01:17:23.263,"There's plenty of time, by the way. We have the whole night, part of the morning, teeniest little bit of the afternoon."
01:17:23.346,01:17:24.431,"So, yeah."
01:17:54.169,01:17:56.755,I can't read it. What does that... What does that say?
01:17:57.422,01:17:59.341,"Sorry, I can't do this."
01:18:08.600,01:18:09.601,Hmm.
01:18:09.935,01:18:13.355,"Not sure about the scansion. What... What, are you leaving?"
01:18:13.521,01:18:17.650,"Yeah. Um, I'm sorry. Maybe I'll think of something later."
01:18:17.776,01:18:20.528,There is no later. She needs the song tomorrow.
01:18:20.612,01:18:22.781,"If we don't give it to her, she's gonna go to someone else."
01:18:22.865,01:18:24.867,I will have... I will have lost the job.
01:18:25.367,01:18:26.409,I'm sorry.
01:18:28.245,01:18:30.789,"-Okay, look. -No, I want to help. I do."
01:18:30.873,01:18:33.666,"I wanna help you finish, but I can't."
01:18:33.751,01:18:38.005,I can't write when I feel like this. I'm not inspired.
01:18:38.088,01:18:40.507,I don't care. I don't care if you're inspired.
01:18:40.590,01:18:42.342,Inspiration's for amateurs.
01:18:42.425,01:18:45.804,I just want four lines. Please. I just want four lines.
01:18:46.346,01:18:49.182,"-I can't. -Oh, but you can and you won't."
01:18:49.391,01:18:52.728,-Are you saying I wanted this to happen? -I'm saying that's what you do.
01:18:52.811,01:18:59.567,You push and push and move the furniture around and talk all the time and screw everything up just like he said.
01:18:59.902,01:19:02.654,Who's he? What are you talking about? What are you saying?
01:19:02.946,01:19:09.494,"I read the book because I wanted to be able to come to you and say, You're not at all like Sally Michaels. But actually, he's got you spot on."
01:19:11.747,01:19:13.415,I'm saying Sloan Cates was right.
01:19:15.918,01:19:18.128,Please take that back!
01:19:18.211,01:19:27.595,"No. The poor, innocent, helpless, 'Oh, I can't write,' she says to herself girl has co-authored three-quarters of a hit song and is holding it ransom because she can't get exactly what she wants."
01:19:31.099,01:19:34.644,"And when it turns out that everything doesn't end happily, you can't deal with it."
01:19:58.668,01:20:07.552,"But now my body just wants to slam Slam C, Alex Fletcher is here."
01:20:07.635,01:20:08.636,"Hey, Alex."
01:20:08.804,01:20:10.638,"Um, C, could I... Could I have a quick word?"
01:20:11.306,01:20:12.390,Thanks a lot.
01:20:12.891,01:20:15.560,"-Hey, Derek, how are you? Good to see you. -Alex Fletcher."
01:20:18.355,01:20:20.482,"Yo, so how's my girl Sophie, man?"
01:20:20.565,01:20:23.151,"Uh, yeah, no, she's keeping it pretty real."
01:20:23.360,01:20:25.112,"Yeah, what a girl. Mmm."
01:20:25.195,01:20:29.407,"C, hi. Listen, it's about the new last verse."
01:20:29.491,01:20:32.535,It's not completely formed in the classical sense yet.
01:20:32.619,01:20:36.248,It's more a kind of string of words that you can connect in almost any way.
01:20:36.331,01:20:38.333,-I think it's quite innovative. -I got the lyrics.
01:20:38.416,01:20:42.420,Sophie faxed them over this morning. They are so beautiful.
01:20:42.504,01:20:44.965,It's what I always wanted to say to my boyfriend.
01:20:45.048,01:20:46.674,It's the perfect end to the song.
01:20:53.056,01:21:14.536,Or if anybody feels the way I feel I need inspiration Not just another negotiation All I wanna do is find a way back into...
01:21:15.954,01:21:18.415,"-Is everything okay? -Yeah, yeah. Sorry, sorry."
01:21:18.623,01:21:21.751,"I just... I just completely, I don't know, spaced out."
01:21:21.960,01:21:24.629,That's okay. Let's take it from the top with the new intro.
01:21:24.754,01:21:26.464,Yep. Great.
01:21:32.804,01:21:41.146,Way back into love ALEX: Hi.
01:21:41.771,01:21:42.940,Hello.
01:21:44.066,01:21:48.070,"Rhonda, I bought these for your children because one should never show up empty-handed."
01:21:48.611,01:21:52.324,"They're aliens. Clearly, I have no children. Here."
01:21:52.908,01:21:55.577,"-Here, let me get that for you. -Thank you."
01:21:58.496,01:22:01.917,"Um, I am gonna go to the office."
01:22:03.085,01:22:06.296,"-I am, too. Have fun with those. -Bye."
