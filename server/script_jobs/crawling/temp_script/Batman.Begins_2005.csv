00:00:46.964,00:00:49.132,"Rachel, let me see!"
00:00:54.889,00:00:57.182,- Can I see?
00:00:57.224,00:01:00.143,- And I found it.
00:01:01.896,00:01:03.564,Finders keepers!
00:01:10.946,00:01:12.447,Bruce?
00:01:17.452,00:01:19.580,Bruce?
00:01:21.415,00:01:23.834,Mom! Mr. Alfred!
00:01:46.899,00:01:50.318,- Did you have dream?
00:01:55.824,00:01:57.158,Worse than this place?
00:02:19.473,00:02:22.059,- 'They are going to fight you.' - Again?
00:02:22.101,00:02:23.769,Until they kill you.
00:02:25.145,00:02:27.230,Can they kill me before breakfast?
00:02:29.650,00:02:32.277,"You are in hell, little man."
00:02:35.781,00:02:38.408,And I am the devil.
00:02:41.578,00:02:44.665,You're not the devil.
00:03:28.333,00:03:30.627,- 'Solitary!' - Why?
00:03:30.669,00:03:33.797,- For protection.
00:03:33.839,00:03:35.674,Protection for them.
00:03:38.343,00:03:39.803,Get in!
00:03:44.224,00:03:49.229,'Are you so desperate to fight criminals' that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time?
00:03:50.522,00:03:54.651,"Actually, there were, uh seven of them."
00:03:54.693,00:03:56.904,"I counted six, Mr. Wayne."
00:04:00.741,00:04:01.950,How do you know my name?
00:04:01.992,00:04:07.789,The world is too small for someone 'like Bruce Wayne to disappear' no matter how deep he chooses to sink.
00:04:07.831,00:04:08.916,Who are you?
00:04:08.957,00:04:16.297,My name is merely Ducard but I speak for Ra's Al Ghul a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld.
00:04:16.339,00:04:18.550,A man who can offer you a path.
00:04:18.592,00:04:21.636,What makes you think I need a path?
00:04:21.678,00:04:24.305,Someone like you is only here by choice.
00:04:24.347,00:04:26.767,You have been exploring the criminal fraternity.
00:04:26.808,00:04:32.606,But whatever your original intentions you have become truly lost.
00:04:35.067,00:04:38.612,And what path can Ra's Al Ghul offer?
00:04:38.653,00:04:46.620,The path of the man who shares his hatred of evil and wishes to serve true justice.
00:04:46.661,00:04:48.872,The path of the League of Shadows.
00:04:52.042,00:04:54.253,- You're vigilantes.
00:04:52.042,00:04:58.590,"- 'No, no, no.' A vigilante is just a man lost in the scramble for his own gratification."
00:04:58.632,00:05:01.969,He can be destroyed or locked up.
00:05:03.804,00:05:13.688,But if you make yourself more than just a man if you devote yourself to an ideal and if they can't stop you..
00:05:15.023,00:05:17.358,...then you become something else entirely.
00:05:19.194,00:05:20.862,Which is?
00:05:20.904,00:05:23.490,"A legend, Mr. Wayne."
00:05:25.284,00:05:26.701,Tomorrow you will be released.
00:05:26.743,00:05:34.293,"If you are bored of brawling with petty thieves 'and want to achieve something, there is a rare blue flower' that grows on the eastern slopes."
00:05:34.334,00:05:36.128,Pick one of these flowers.
00:05:36.170,00:05:42.217,If you can carry it to the top of the mountain you may find what you were looking for in the first place.
00:05:42.259,00:05:45.179,And what was I looking for?
00:05:47.055,00:05:48.765,Only you can know that.
00:06:55.540,00:06:58.335,You turn back.
00:08:07.404,00:08:26.340,'Ra's Al Ghul?' 'Wait.' What are you seeking?
00:08:26.381,00:08:28.133,I seek..
00:08:29.801,00:08:32.262,...the means to fight injustice.
00:08:32.304,00:08:37.142,To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.
00:08:59.414,00:09:02.042,To manipulate the fears in others..
00:09:03.293,00:09:05.920,...you must first master your own.
00:09:07.297,00:09:09.924,Are you ready to begin?
00:09:09.966,00:09:12.511,"I, I can barely stand."
00:09:12.552,00:09:15.055,Death does not wait for you to be ready.
00:09:15.096,00:09:17.640,Death is not considerate or fair!
00:09:19.017,00:09:20.894,And make no mistake.
00:09:20.935,00:09:23.522,"Here, you face death."
00:09:27.275,00:09:28.651,Tiger.
00:09:30.278,00:09:31.279,Jujitsu.
00:09:34.241,00:09:35.409,Panther.
00:09:39.037,00:09:41.206,"You're skilled, but this is not a dance."
00:09:46.836,00:09:48.922,And you are afraid..
00:09:51.216,00:09:53.134,...but not of me.
00:09:56.637,00:09:58.848,"Tell us, Mr. Wayne.."
00:10:03.770,00:10:05.980,...what do you fear?
00:10:16.074,00:10:17.576,Bruce?
00:10:20.036,00:10:22.789,It's okay. It's okay.
00:10:22.830,00:10:26.626,"'You'll be okay.' Will we be needing an ambulance, Master Wayne?"
00:10:26.667,00:10:29.963,"No, I'll set the bone and take him for an X-ray later."
00:10:30.004,00:10:31.381,"Very good, sir."
00:10:31.423,00:10:32.549,"I'm very sorry, sir."
00:10:31.423,00:10:34.717,I've told-- Don't worry. It's fine.
00:10:37.554,00:10:39.639,"Took quite a fall, didn't we, Master Bruce?"
00:10:39.680,00:10:41.391,"And why do we fall, Bruce?"
00:10:41.433,00:10:43.726,So we can learn to pick ourselves up.
00:10:47.147,00:10:48.815,- What happened?
00:10:48.856,00:10:51.192,"- Oh, my poor child."
00:11:00.160,00:11:02.203,The bats again?
00:11:05.248,00:11:07.750,"You know why they attacked you, don't you?"
00:11:07.792,00:11:11.129,- They were afraid of you.
00:11:11.171,00:11:13.006,All creatures feel fear.
00:11:13.047,00:11:14.549,Even the scary ones?
00:11:14.591,00:11:16.884,Especially the scary ones.
00:11:16.926,00:11:18.970,I got something to show you.
00:11:22.890,00:11:24.809,You think your mother will like 'em?
00:11:24.851,00:11:26.978,Yeah.
00:11:27.020,00:11:28.855,- I think it's time to get up?
00:11:28.896,00:11:36.446,"'No going back to bed.' Did you build this train, dad?"
00:11:36.488,00:11:41.451,Gotham's been good to our family but the city's been suffering.
00:11:41.493,00:11:44.787,People less fortunate than us have been enduring very hard times.
00:11:44.829,00:11:52.837,"'So we built a new, cheap public transportation system' 'to unite the city.' And at the center, Wayne Tower."
00:11:52.879,00:11:55.965,- Is that where you work?
00:11:52.879,00:12:03.223,"- 'No, I work at the hospital.' 'I leave the running of our company' 'to much better men.' - Better?"
00:13:00.196,00:13:01.948,Can we go?
00:13:04.033,00:13:05.993,Please?
00:13:06.035,00:13:07.912,Okay. Let's go.
00:13:17.380,00:13:20.216,"- What's wrong, Bruce?"
00:13:20.258,00:13:25.221,'I just needed some fresh air.' A little bit of opera goes a long way.
00:13:25.263,00:13:26.805,"Right, Bruce?"
00:13:28.516,00:13:30.685,Come on. Let's go.
00:13:36.483,00:13:38.276,"Wallet, jewelry! Come on, fast!"
00:13:38.318,00:13:40.153,- That's fine.
00:13:38.318,00:13:42.196,- 'Fast.' Take it easy.
00:13:42.238,00:13:46.159,'Take it easy.' Here you go.
00:13:49.036,00:13:51.205,It's fine. It's fine.
00:13:52.582,00:13:57.211,'Now just take it and go.' - I said jewelry.
00:13:59.464,00:14:01.508,Thomas!
00:14:09.223,00:14:10.684,Bruce..
00:14:13.353,00:14:14.937,...it's okay.
00:14:17.940,00:14:19.651,Don't be afraid.
00:14:51.474,00:14:53.142,Is that your father's?
00:14:54.853,00:14:56.229,It's okay.
00:14:58.189,00:14:59.607,Come here.
00:15:02.443,00:15:04.070,There you go.
00:15:07.824,00:15:09.075,It's okay.
00:15:11.578,00:15:13.037,It's okay.
00:15:17.291,00:15:28.219,'Gordon.' Hey.
00:15:29.262,00:15:30.722,Good news.
00:15:31.931,00:15:56.497,"'We got him, son.' You're in excellent hands."
00:15:56.539,00:15:58.207,We'll be watching the empire.
00:15:58.249,00:16:00.668,"When you grow up, it will be waiting for you."
00:16:17.268,00:16:19.646,I thought I might prepare a little supper.
00:16:25.693,00:16:27.862,- Very well.
00:16:31.532,00:16:33.910,"- Yes, Master Bruce?"
00:16:33.952,00:16:35.787,"- Oh, no. No, no, no."
00:16:35.829,00:16:38.832,- If I hadn't gotten scared..
00:16:39.916,00:16:42.752,It was him and him alone.
00:16:43.878,00:16:45.254,Do you understand?
00:16:48.424,00:16:51.594,"I miss them, Alfred."
00:16:51.636,00:16:53.805,"So do I, Master Bruce."
00:16:56.056,00:16:57.558,So do I.
00:16:59.226,00:17:02.438,Do you still feel responsible for your parents' death?
00:17:02.480,00:17:05.358,My anger outweighs my guilt.
00:17:05.399,00:17:06.734,Come.
00:17:11.238,00:17:13.992,You have learned to bury your guilt with anger.
00:17:14.033,00:17:17.244,I will teach you to confront it and to face the truth.
00:17:19.831,00:17:21.499,You know how to fight six men.
00:17:21.541,00:17:24.210,We can teach you how to engage 600.
00:17:26.045,00:17:27.797,You know how to disappear.
00:17:27.839,00:17:30.550,We can teach you to become truly invisible.
00:17:31.926,00:17:33.845,Invisible?
00:17:37.264,00:17:42.228,The ninja understands that invisibility is a matter of patience and agility.
00:17:55.033,00:17:57.117,Always mind your surroundings.
00:18:00.162,00:18:03.624,Ninjitsu employs explosive powders..
00:18:03.666,00:18:06.002,...as weapons or distractions.
00:18:06.044,00:18:09.213,Theatricality and deception are powerful agents.
00:18:09.255,00:18:13.092,You must become more than just a man in the mind of your opponent.
00:18:14.343,00:18:16.303,- Who is he?
00:18:16.345,00:18:20.975,'Then he tried to take his neighbor's land' 'and became a murderer.
00:18:18.639,00:18:23.436,Now he is a prisoner.' - What will happen to him?
00:18:21.017,00:18:25.021,- 'Justice.' Crime cannot be tolerated.
00:18:25.063,00:18:29.067,Criminals thrive on the indulgence of society's understanding.
00:18:33.029,00:18:35.698,Your parents' death was not your fault.
00:18:44.415,00:18:46.250,It was your father's.
00:19:06.437,00:19:09.231,Anger does not change the fact that your father failed to act.
00:19:09.273,00:19:12.401,- The man had a gun.
00:19:12.443,00:19:15.738,- I've had training.
00:19:15.780,00:19:17.573,Will is everything!
00:19:23.162,00:19:25.039,The will to act.
00:19:35.091,00:19:38.052,- Yield.
00:19:38.094,00:19:40.721,You have sacrificed sure footing for a killing stroke.
00:19:48.437,00:19:50.648,Rub your chest.
00:19:50.690,00:19:53.026,Your arms will take care of themselves.
00:19:56.195,00:19:58.572,You are stronger than your father.
00:19:58.614,00:20:00.240,You didn't know my father.
00:20:00.282,00:20:08.166,'But I know the rage that drives you.' That impossible anger strangling the grief until the memory of your loved one is just..
00:20:08.207,00:20:10.043,...poison in your veins.
00:20:10.084,00:20:18.592,'And one day you catch yourself' 'wishing the person you loved had never existed.' So you'd be spared your pain.
00:20:21.595,00:20:28.769,'I wasn't always here in the mountains.' Once I had a wife.
00:20:29.603,00:20:31.313,My great love.
00:20:32.857,00:20:35.026,She was taken from me.
00:20:35.068,00:20:41.657,"'Like you, I was forced to learn there are those without decency' who must be fought without hesitation, without pity."
00:20:43.534,00:20:48.873,"Your anger gives you great power but if you let it, it will destroy you."
00:20:50.499,00:20:52.251,As it almost did me.
00:20:52.292,00:20:54.461,- What stopped it?
00:20:55.337,00:20:57.381,That's no help to me.
00:20:57.423,00:21:12.312,"'Why, Bruce?' 'Why could you not avenge your parents?' Will you be heading back to Princeton after the hearing, sir or can I persuade you to stay on for a day or two?"
00:21:12.354,00:21:14.690,I'm not heading back at all.
00:21:14.732,00:21:16.817,- You don't like it there?
00:21:16.859,00:21:19.237,They just don't feel the same way.
00:21:20.821,00:21:22.990,I've prepared the master bedroom.
00:21:23.032,00:21:25.868,No. My room will be fine.
00:21:25.910,00:21:28.913,"With all due respect, sir, Wayne Manor is your house."
00:21:28.955,00:21:30.957,"No, Alfred, it's my father's house."
00:21:30.998,00:21:33.500,"- Your father is dead, Master-- - And this place is a mausoleum."
00:21:33.542,00:21:36.837,"If I have my way, I'll pull the damn thing down brick by brick."
00:21:36.879,00:21:41.050,"This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered six generations of your family."
00:21:41.092,00:21:43.803,"Why do you give a damn, Alfred?"
00:21:44.678,00:21:52.686,I give a damn because a good man once made me responsible for what was most precious to him in the whole world.
00:21:55.773,00:21:59.235,Miss Dawes has offered to drive you to the hearing.
00:21:59.277,00:22:01.320,She probably hopes to talk you out of going.
00:22:01.361,00:22:04.865,"Should I just bury the past out there with my parents, Alfred?"
00:22:04.907,00:22:08.286,"I wouldn't presume to tell you what to do with your past, sir."
00:22:08.327,00:22:12.414,Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future.
00:22:13.791,00:22:16.710,- Haven't given up on me yet?
00:23:05.968,00:23:10.348,Alfred still keeps the condensed milk on the top shelf.
00:23:10.388,00:23:12.599,Hasn't he noticed you're tall enough to reach now?
00:23:12.641,00:23:15.769,"- Old habits die hard, I guess."
00:23:15.811,00:23:17.897,"No, it didn't."
00:23:19.232,00:23:21.441,She misses this place.
00:23:23.027,00:23:24.778,So do I.
00:23:24.820,00:23:26.280,Yeah.
00:23:26.322,00:23:31.285,'But it's nothing without the people' 'who made it what it was.' Now there's only Alfred.
00:23:31.327,00:23:33.913,- And you.
00:23:33.954,00:23:36.165,You're just back for the hearing.
00:23:39.710,00:23:44.131,"Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way to convince you not to come."
00:23:44.173,00:23:47.551,Someone at this proceeding..
00:23:48.635,00:23:50.763,...should stand for my parents.
00:23:50.804,00:23:52.890,"We all loved your parents, Bruce."
00:23:52.932,00:23:54.641,What Chill did is unforgivable.
00:23:54.683,00:23:57.603,Then why's your boss letting him go?
00:23:57.644,00:24:01.107,"In prison, he shared a cell with Carmine Falcone."
00:24:01.148,00:24:04.944,He learned things and he will testify in exchange for early parole.
00:24:04.985,00:24:07.571,"Rachel, this man killed my parents."
00:24:09.656,00:24:11.449,I cannot let that pass.
00:24:11.491,00:24:14.203,"And I need you to understand that, please."
00:24:16.205,00:24:18.124,Okay.
00:24:18.165,00:24:27.049,"'The Depression hit working people' 'like Mr. Chill hardest of all.' 'His crime was appalling, yes' but it was motivated not by greed but by desperation."
00:24:27.091,00:24:36.725,And given the 14 years already served as well as his extraordinary level of cooperation with one of this office's most important investigations we strongly endorse his petition for early release.
00:24:38.436,00:24:40.313,Mr. Chill?
00:24:44.150,00:24:49.780,"Your Honor, not a day goes by that I don't wish I could take back what I did."
00:24:52.532,00:24:57.495,"'Sure, I was desperate like a lot of people back then' but that don't change what I did."
00:25:01.792,00:25:08.674,'I gather there is a member of the Wayne family here today.' Has he got anything to say?
00:25:23.605,00:25:26.775,"'He's coming out this side!' He's coming out this side, guys!"
00:25:36.118,00:25:37.828,Bruce Wayne!
00:25:40.414,00:25:43.042,"Joe! Hey, Joe!"
00:25:53.427,00:25:56.430,"Come on, Bruce."
00:25:58.015,00:25:59.350,I do.
00:26:04.271,00:26:11.195,'The DA couldn't understand why Judge Faden' 'insisted on making the hearing public.' Falcone paid him off to get Chill out in the open.
00:26:11.237,00:26:12.612,Maybe I should be thanking them.
00:26:12.654,00:26:13.947,You don't mean that.
00:26:13.989,00:26:17.368,"'What if I do, Rachel?' My parents deserved justice."
00:26:17.410,00:26:19.036,"Well, you're not talking about justice."
00:26:19.078,00:26:20.413,You're talking about revenge.
00:26:20.454,00:26:21.747,"Well, sometimes they're the same."
00:26:21.788,00:26:24.958,"'No, they're never the same, Bruce.' Justice is about harmony."
00:26:25.000,00:26:31.257,"Revenge is about about you 'making yourself feel better.' 'Which is why we have an impartial system.' Well, your system is broken."
00:26:37.888,00:26:41.225,"'You care about justice?' Look beyond your own pain, Bruce."
00:26:41.267,00:26:53.237,"'This city is rotting.' 'They talk about the Depression' 'as if it's history, and it's not.' 'Things are worse than ever down here.' 'Falcone floods our streets with crime and drugs' 'preying on the desperate' creating new Joe Chills every day."
00:26:53.279,00:27:05.832,"You know, Falcone may not have killed your parents, Bruce 'but he's destroying everything that they stood for.' You wanna thank him for that, here you go."
00:27:08.168,00:27:09.627,We all know where to find him.
00:27:09.669,00:27:13.591,"But as long as he keeps the bad people rich and the good people scared, no one will touch him."
00:27:13.631,00:27:17.886,Good people like your parents who'll stand against injustice they're gone.
00:27:17.928,00:27:21.599,What chance does Gotham have when the good people do nothing?
00:27:22.766,00:27:25.060,"I'm not one of your good people, Rachel."
00:27:25.102,00:27:26.604,What do you mean?
00:27:28.522,00:27:30.690,"All these years, I wanted to kill him."
00:27:32.151,00:27:33.569,Now I can't.
00:27:49.918,00:27:52.004,Your father would be ashamed of you.
00:28:34.672,00:28:37.966,"You're taller than you look in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne."
00:28:38.008,00:28:40.135,No gun? I'm insulted.
00:28:42.888,00:28:44.557,You could have just sent a thank-you note.
00:28:44.598,00:28:46.975,I didn't come here to thank you.
00:28:47.017,00:28:49.562,I came here to show you that not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.
00:28:49.603,00:28:51.438,"Only those who know me, kid."
00:28:51.480,00:28:52.939,Look around you.
00:28:52.981,00:29:03.950,"You'll see two councilmen uh, a union official 'couple off-duty cops, and a judge.' Now I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of blowing your head off right here and right now in front of them."
00:29:03.992,00:29:06.036,Now that's power you can't buy.
00:29:07.496,00:29:09.373,That's the power of fear.
00:29:09.415,00:29:10.666,I'm not afraid of you.
00:29:10.708,00:29:12.501,Because you think you got nothing to lose.
00:29:12.543,00:29:14.587,But you haven't thought it through.
00:29:14.628,00:29:17.715,You haven't thought about your lady friend down in the DA's office.
00:29:17.756,00:29:20.050,You haven't thought about your old butler.
00:29:20.092,00:29:21.468,Bang!
00:29:24.638,00:29:29.560,People from your world have so much to lose.
00:29:29.602,00:29:39.319,"Now you think because your mommy and your daddy got shot 'you know about the ugly side of life, but you don't.' You've never tasted desperate."
00:29:39.361,00:29:42.072,"You're, uh, you're Bruce Wayne, the prince of Gotham."
00:29:42.114,00:29:44.908,You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet someone who didn't know your name.
00:29:44.950,00:29:50.038,"So don't, don't come down here with your anger, tryin' to prove something to yourself."
00:29:50.080,00:29:56.128,'This is a world you'll never understand.' And you'll always fear what you don't understand.
00:30:00.006,00:30:01.675,Alright.
00:30:08.932,00:30:12.102,"Yeah, you got spirit, kid."
00:30:12.144,00:30:14.187,"More than your old man, anyway."
00:30:14.229,00:30:18.567,"In the joint, Chill told me, uh he told me about the night he killed your parents."
00:30:18.609,00:30:25.115,'He said your father begged for mercy.' Begged...like a dog.
00:30:38.378,00:30:40.213,Should have tipped better.
00:30:50.140,00:30:52.685,- For what?
00:30:52.726,00:30:54.102,Okay.
00:30:55.312,00:30:58.691,"'Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it.' It's a nice coat."
00:30:58.732,00:31:01.318,Be careful who sees you with that.
00:31:01.360,00:31:02.820,They're gonna come looking for me.
00:31:02.861,00:31:05.238,- Who?
00:31:08.074,00:31:11.870,"It's, it's a nice coat."
00:31:30.013,00:31:34.267,When you lived among the criminals did you start to pity them?
00:31:34.309,00:31:37.479,The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve.
00:31:37.521,00:31:43.694,"Yes, I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong."
00:31:45.362,00:31:53.953,And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success.
00:31:55.581,00:31:57.957,But I never became one of them.
00:32:00.544,00:32:14.850,'Fool. What the hell do I care what your name is?' 'You're a criminal.' 'Tell that to the guy who owned these.' You traveled the world to understand the criminal mind and conquer your fears.
00:32:16.351,00:32:23.942,'But a criminal is not complicated.' And what you really fear is inside yourself.
00:32:23.983,00:32:26.862,You fear your own power.
00:32:26.904,00:32:33.076,You fear your anger the drive to do great or terrible things.
00:32:33.118,00:32:35.788,"Now, you must journey inwards."
00:32:40.250,00:32:41.960,You are ready.
00:32:43.420,00:32:44.755,Breathe.
00:32:54.306,00:32:56.182,Breathe.
00:33:01.271,00:33:13.659,"'Breathe in your fears.' 'Face them.' 'To conquer fear, you must become fear.' You must bask in the fear of other men."
00:33:15.994,00:33:18.747,And men fear most what they cannot see.
00:33:36.473,00:33:38.934,You have to become a terrible thought.
00:33:43.897,00:33:45.315,A wraith.
00:33:50.946,00:33:52.739,You have to become an idea!
00:34:00.246,00:35:09.608,'Feel terror cloud your senses.' 'Feel its power to distort..' '...to control..' '...and know that this power can be yours.' 'Embrace your worst fear.' 'Become one with the darkness.' 'Focus.' 'Concentrate.' Master your senses.
00:35:37.010,00:35:40.013,You cannot leave any sign.
00:35:40.055,00:35:41.264,I haven't.
00:35:49.522,00:35:51.024,Impressive.
00:36:01.034,00:36:03.662,We have purged your fear.
00:36:03.703,00:36:05.580,You are ready to lead these men.
00:36:05.622,00:36:09.084,'You are ready to become a member' of the League of Shadows.
00:36:11.837,00:36:15.841,"But first, you must demonstrate your commitment to justice."
00:36:32.649,00:36:34.151,No.
00:36:35.568,00:36:37.362,I'm no executioner.
00:36:37.403,00:36:43.869,'Your compassion is a weakness' 'your enemies will not share.' That's why it's so important.
00:36:43.910,00:36:45.620,It separates us from them.
00:36:45.662,00:36:48.247,You want to fight criminals.
00:36:48.289,00:36:52.251,- This man should be tried.
00:36:52.293,00:36:54.880,Criminals mock society's laws.
00:36:54.921,00:36:57.966,You know this better than most.
00:36:58.008,00:37:05.306,'You cannot lead these men' unless you are prepared to do what is necessary to defeat evil.
00:37:05.348,00:37:08.351,And where would I be leading these men?
00:37:08.393,00:37:09.769,Gotham.
00:37:09.811,00:37:16.651,'As Gotham's favored son' you will be ideally placed to strike at the heart of criminality.
00:37:16.693,00:37:20.739,- How?
00:37:20.780,00:37:28.496,Like Constantinople or Rome before it the city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice.
00:37:28.538,00:37:32.125,It is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.
00:37:32.167,00:37:41.300,'This is the most important function' 'of the League of Shadows.' It is one we've performed for centuries.
00:37:41.342,00:37:45.638,Gotham must be destroyed.
00:37:49.434,00:37:51.019,You can't believe in this.
00:37:51.061,00:38:00.278,Ra's Al Ghul rescued us 'from the darkest corners of our own hearts.' 'What he asks in return' is the courage to do what is necessary.
00:38:00.319,00:38:06.534,I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men like this but I will not become an executioner.
00:38:06.576,00:38:08.453,"Bruce, please."
00:38:08.494,00:38:11.330,"For your own sake, there is no turning back."
00:38:43.404,00:38:45.364,- What are you doing?
00:41:02.627,00:41:05.797,I will tell him you saved his life.
00:41:24.523,00:41:27.026,"Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time."
00:41:27.068,00:41:29.570,"- Yes, I have."
00:41:31.030,00:41:32.698,Apart from the mud.
00:41:32.740,00:41:35.534,"Are you coming back to Gotham for long, sir?"
00:41:35.576,00:41:36.702,As long as it takes.
00:41:36.744,00:41:42.041,I'm gonna show the people of Gotham their city doesn't belong to the criminals and the corrupt.
00:41:42.083,00:41:46.796,"In the Depression, your father nearly bankrupted Wayne Enterprises combating poverty."
00:41:46.838,00:41:52.010,He believed that his example could inspire the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.
00:41:52.051,00:41:53.428,Did it?
00:41:54.471,00:41:56.139,In a way.
00:41:56.181,00:41:59.351,Their murder shocked the wealthy and the powerful into action.
00:42:01.227,00:42:06.232,People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy and I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.
00:42:06.274,00:42:08.860,"As a man, I'm flesh and blood."
00:42:08.901,00:42:10.569,"I can be ignored, I can be destroyed."
00:42:10.611,00:42:12.571,But as a symbol..
00:42:14.240,00:42:16.701,"...as a symbol, I can be incorruptible."
00:42:16.742,00:42:20.038,'I can be everlasting.' What symbol?
00:42:20.079,00:42:24.459,Something...elemental something terrifying.
00:42:24.501,00:42:32.217,I assume that as you're taking on the underworld this symbol is a persona to protect those you care about from reprisals.
00:42:32.258,00:42:33.551,You're thinking about Rachel?
00:42:33.592,00:42:36.262,"Actually, sir, I was thinkin' of myself."
00:42:38.390,00:42:39.932,Have you told anyone I'm coming back?
00:42:39.974,00:42:44.354,I just couldn't figure the legal ramifications of bringing you back from the dead.
00:42:44.396,00:42:46.439,- Dead?
00:42:46.481,00:42:48.149,You had me declared dead?
00:42:48.191,00:42:50.860,"Oh, actually, it was Mr. Earle."
00:42:50.902,00:42:55.907,'He wanted to liquidate your majority share holding.' Those shares are worth quite a bit of money.
00:42:55.948,00:42:59.244,"Well, it's a good thing I left everything to you then."
00:42:59.285,00:43:01.120,"Quite so, sir."
00:43:01.162,00:43:02.621,And you can borrow the Rolls if you like.
00:43:02.663,00:43:04.957,Just bring it back with a full tank.
00:43:14.717,00:43:29.732,"In my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much a danger to himself as to others and prison is probably not the best environment 'for his rehabilitation.' - Dr. Crane."
00:43:29.774,00:43:32.902,You really think a man who butchers people for the mob doesn't belong in jail?
00:43:32.944,00:43:35.988,"Well, I would hardly have testified to that otherwise, would I, Miss Dawes?"
00:43:36.030,00:43:40.493,This is the third of Carmine Falcone's thugs you've had declared insane and moved into your asylum.
00:43:40.535,00:43:44.914,"Well, the work offered by organized crime must have an attraction to the insane."
00:43:47.083,00:43:48.751,Or the corrupt.
00:43:51.296,00:43:53.005,Mr. Finch.
00:43:53.047,00:43:59.512,"I think you should check with Miss Dawes here just what implications your office has authorized her to make, if any."
00:44:03.391,00:44:05.977,"- What are you doing, Rachel?"
00:44:06.018,00:44:07.395,Lookin' out for you.
00:44:09.772,00:44:12.984,Falcone has half the city bought and paid for.
00:44:13.025,00:44:14.902,- Drop it.
00:44:14.944,00:44:18.906,Because much as I care about getting Falcone I care more about you.
00:44:18.948,00:44:20.325,That's sweet.
00:44:25.788,00:44:27.832,We've been through all that.
00:44:54.359,00:44:55.860,"Blessed bat again, sir."
00:44:55.901,00:44:58.070,They nest somewhere in the grounds.
00:46:56.439,00:46:59.191,No more favors.
00:46:59.233,00:47:02.403,"Hey, I scratch your back, you scratch mine, doc."
00:47:02.445,00:47:05.782,- I'm bringing in the shipments.
00:47:05.822,00:47:08.534,Maybe money isn't as interesting to me as favors.
00:47:10.662,00:47:15.667,"I am more than aware that you are not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone."
00:47:15.708,00:47:17.834,But you know who I'm working for.
00:47:17.876,00:47:19.920,- 'And when he gets here--' - He..
00:47:19.962,00:47:22.590,- He's coming to Gotham?
00:47:22.632,00:47:29.555,"And when he gets here, he's not going to wanna hear that you have endangered our operation just to get your thugs out of a little jail time."
00:47:31.349,00:47:32.642,Who's bothering you?
00:47:32.684,00:47:35.102,There's a girl at the DA's office.
00:47:35.144,00:47:37.396,- We'll buy her off.
00:47:37.438,00:47:40.358,"Oh, idealist, huh?"
00:47:40.399,00:47:42.318,"Well, there's an answer to that too."
00:47:42.360,00:47:45.488,- I don't wanna know.
00:47:49.534,00:47:52.953,"No, we are showing very healthy growth in these sectors."
00:47:52.995,00:47:58.793,I don't think that Thomas Wayne would have viewed heavy arms manufacture as a suitable cornerstone for our business.
00:48:00.044,00:48:04.131,"That's 20 years ago, Fredericks."
00:48:04.173,00:48:10.221,"I think after 20 years, we can allow ourselves to stop thinking about what Thomas Wayne would have done."
00:48:10.262,00:48:12.431,'Good morning.
00:48:10.262,00:48:19.397,"Mr. Earle's office.' 'Oh, yes, he's confirmed for the dinner tomorrow evening.' Good morning."
00:48:19.438,00:48:22.358,- Name?
00:48:25.069,00:48:33.619,Thomas would probably not have taken the company public but that is what we as responsible managers are going to do.
00:48:33.661,00:48:34.871,Jessica.

00:49:09.988,00:49:12.742,And I'll be handsomely rewarded for my shares.

00:55:56.394,00:55:59.231,Now what is it today?
00:55:59.273,00:56:02.400,No. Today it's BASE jumping.

00:58:06.858,00:58:08.402,Sure.
00:58:08.444,00:58:12.364,Word on the street is you got a beef with somebody in the DA's office.
00:58:12.406,00:58:13.782,Is that right?
00:58:13.824,00:58:18.245,And that there's a fat prize waiting for anybody willing to do anything about it.
00:58:18.287,00:58:20.831,"So what's your point, Mr. Flass?"
00:58:20.872,00:58:22.333,Have you seen the girl?

00:59:34.654,00:59:36.948,Bats frighten me.
00:59:36.990,00:59:39.201,It's time my enemies shared my dread.

01:00:25.789,01:00:28.959,- What's the difference?
01:00:29.000,01:00:32.421,Don't burden yourself with these secrets of scary people.
01:00:48.145,01:00:49.271,Hey.

01:02:24.408,01:02:26.868,- Where are you?
01:02:48.098,01:02:50.350,Take a ride.
01:02:50.392,01:02:51.809,"Oh, shit."
01:03:09.786,01:03:11.788,What the hell are you?

01:04:10.930,01:04:12.349,Hold it.
01:04:14.017,01:04:16.269,That's right. You better run.
01:04:25.570,01:04:28.532,Falcone sent them to kill you.
01:04:28.573,01:04:31.075,- Why?
01:04:34.788,01:04:36.414,- What's this?
01:04:36.456,01:04:38.542,- For what?
01:04:38.583,01:04:39.959,Who are you?
01:04:40.877,01:04:42.045,Someone like you.
01:04:42.086,01:04:52.138,'Someone who'll rattle the cages.' - 'Help.' - Everything okay?
01:04:57.227,01:04:59.896,- Falcone's men?
01:04:59.937,01:05:02.232,"We'll never tie him to it, anyway."
01:05:02.273,01:05:04.484,I wouldn't be too sure of that.
01:05:17.414,01:05:30.427,'What the hell is that?' Cut him down.
01:05:52.741,01:05:59.539,"'Unacceptable.' Now, I don't care if it's rival gangs guardian angels, or the goddamn Salvation Army."

01:06:08.757,01:06:12.510,"This guy did deliver us one of the, uh city's biggest crime lords."
01:06:12.552,01:06:17.557,No one takes the law into their own hands in my city. Understand?
01:06:17.599,01:06:19.392,- 'No way to bury it now.' - Maybe so.
01:06:19.434,01:06:21.352,- But there's still Judge Faden.
01:06:21.394,01:06:23.730,"Okay. What about this, uh, bat they're babbling about?"
01:06:23.772,01:06:29.402,Even if these guys will swear in court to being thrashed by a giant bat we've got Falcone at the scene.
01:06:29.444,01:06:31.070,"Drugs, prints, cargo manifests."
01:06:31.112,01:06:33.030,This bat character gave us everything.
01:06:33.072,01:06:35.199,Okay. Let's do it.
01:06:37.911,01:06:39.412,Bats are nocturnal.

01:07:08.608,01:07:12.654,"Strange injuries, a nonexistent social life."

01:07:41.098,01:07:45.478,The coast guard picked up one of our cargo ships last night.
01:07:45.520,01:07:49.399,Heavily damaged.
01:07:52.318,01:07:54.779,The ship was carrying a prototype weapon.
01:07:54.821,01:07:56.280,It's a-a microwave emitter.
01:07:56.322,01:08:00.201,"It's designed for, uh, desert warfare but it.."
01:08:01.786,01:08:03.621,"It-it looks like somebody, um.."
01:08:07.584,01:08:09.252,...turned it on.
01:08:13.172,01:08:18.386,"It uses focused microwaves to, uh, vaporize the enemy's water supply."
01:08:25.476,01:08:28.563,The damage to the ship was catastrophic.
01:08:28.605,01:08:31.107,"The weapon itself is, um.."
01:08:33.068,01:08:34.360,Missing?
01:08:35.403,01:08:36.738,Yeah.
01:08:43.536,01:08:46.581,- Nice car.
01:08:56.340,01:09:03.765,"'He's done something the police have never done.' 'You can't take the law into your own hands.' Well, at least he's getting something done."

01:09:06.517,01:09:11.773,"Well, a guy who dresses up like a bat clearly has issues."
01:09:11.815,01:09:13.900,But he's put Falcone behind bars.
01:09:13.942,01:09:18.071,'And now the cops wanna bring him in' 'so what does that tell you?' They're jealous.
01:09:18.113,01:09:23.576,"Sir, the pool is for decoration and your friends do not have swimwear."
01:09:26.203,01:09:28.247,"Well, they're European."
01:09:29.958,01:09:33.377,I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
01:09:33.419,01:09:44.388,"'It is not a question of money.' Well, you see I'm buying this hotel and, uh, setting some new rules about the pool area."
01:09:46.557,01:09:48.935,I think the Batman deserves a medal.
01:09:48.977,01:09:50.937,And a straitjacket to pin it on.
01:09:53.106,01:09:54.607,Goodnight.
01:09:57.777,01:09:59.195,"Thank you, sir."
01:10:01.031,01:10:02.406,Bruce?
01:10:06.036,01:10:07.829,Rachel?
01:10:07.871,01:10:09.831,I'd heard you were back.
01:10:11.332,01:10:15.086,- What are you doing?
01:10:15.128,01:10:18.131,"Wow, it is good to see you."
01:10:18.173,01:10:21.258,- You were gone a long time.
01:10:21.300,01:10:23.636,- How are things?
01:10:25.138,01:10:26.890,Job's getting worse.
01:10:26.931,01:10:29.767,Can't change the world on your own.
01:10:29.809,01:10:31.519,What choice do I have..
01:10:32.729,01:10:34.856,...when you're too busy swimming?
01:10:35.773,01:10:38.068,"Rachel, all of.."
01:10:38.109,01:10:39.652,All this..
01:10:41.196,01:10:43.573,"It's, it's not me."
01:10:43.614,01:10:44.991,It's..
01:10:45.783,01:10:47.785,"Inside, I am.."
01:10:49.328,01:10:51.789,I am more.
01:10:51.831,01:10:56.920,"'Come on, Bruce, come on!' Bruce, we have some more hotels for you to buy!"
01:10:58.504,01:11:00.006,Bruce..
01:11:01.174,01:11:05.011,"...deep down, you may still be that same great kid you used to be."
01:11:07.222,01:11:10.100,But it's not who you are underneath.
01:11:10.141,01:11:12.268,It's what you do that defines you.
01:11:24.488,01:11:27.867,"- Dr. Crane, thanks for coming."
01:11:27.909,01:11:29.160,He cut his wrists?
01:11:29.202,01:11:31.537,Probably looking for the insanity plea.
01:11:31.579,01:11:33.248,But if anything should happen..
01:11:33.289,01:11:35.625,Of course.
01:11:39.462,01:11:42.048,"Hey, yeah, Dr. Crane, I can't take it anymore."
01:11:42.090,01:11:44.467,It's all too much.
01:11:44.508,01:11:46.219,"Blah, blah, blah."
01:11:46.261,01:11:49.305,"A couple of days of this food, it will be true."
01:11:49.346,01:11:50.807,What do you want?
01:11:50.848,01:11:54.102,I wanna know how you're gonna convince me to keep my mouth shut.
01:11:54.144,01:11:56.395,About what?
01:11:56.437,01:12:00.775,I know you don't want the cops to take a closer look at the drugs they seized.
01:12:00.817,01:12:05.113,And I know about your experiments with the inmates of your nut house.
01:12:05.155,01:12:09.366,"'See, I don't go into business with a guy' without finding out his dirty secrets."
01:12:09.408,01:12:12.453,"And, oh, those goons you used."
01:12:12.495,01:12:14.455,I own the muscle in this town.
01:12:14.497,01:12:22.505,"Now, I've been bringing your stuff in for months so whatever he's planning, it's big, and I want in."
01:12:24.007,01:12:26.550,"Well, I already know what he'll say."
01:12:27.718,01:12:29.012,That we should kill you.
01:12:30.596,01:12:32.932,"Nah, even he can't get me in here."
01:12:32.974,01:12:34.809,Not in my town.
01:12:40.106,01:12:42.025,Would you like to see my mask?
01:12:43.318,01:12:45.361,I use it in my experiments.
01:12:46.946,01:12:55.663,"Now I'm probably not very frightening to a guy like you but these crazies, they can't stand it."
01:12:55.705,01:12:58.541,So when did the nut take over the nut house?
01:12:58.582,01:13:01.169,They scream and they cry..
01:13:02.253,01:13:04.463,...much as you're doing now.
01:13:06.216,01:13:09.468,"Well, he's not faking."
01:13:09.510,01:13:15.058,I'll talk to the judge and see if I can get him moved to the secure wing at Arkham.
01:13:37.747,01:13:46.589,'Storm's coming.' The scum is getting jumpy because you stood up to Falcone.
01:13:46.630,01:13:48.007,It's a start.
01:13:48.049,01:13:53.679,"'Your partner was at the docks with Falcone.' Well, he moonlights as a low-level enforcer."
01:13:53.721,01:13:55.723,They were splitting the shipment in two.
01:13:55.765,01:14:00.061,'Only half went to the dealers.' Why? What about the other half?
01:14:00.103,01:14:02.188,- Flass knows.
01:14:03.106,01:14:04.899,He'll talk to me.
01:14:04.941,01:14:10.113,'Commissioner Loeb set up a massive task force' to catch you.
01:14:10.154,01:14:11.697,What do you think?
01:14:12.949,01:14:15.034,I think you're trying to help.
01:14:20.248,01:14:22.458,But I've been wrong before.
01:14:28.298,01:14:30.425,"Come on, I ain't got all night."
01:14:33.344,01:14:35.638,"Flass, I have kids to feed."
01:14:35.679,01:14:37.807,"What, they don't like falafel?"
01:14:46.316,01:14:47.608,Whoa!
01:14:53.281,01:14:55.032,Where were the other drugs going?
01:14:55.074,01:14:57.368,I-I-I never knew.
01:14:57.410,01:14:59.495,I don't know. I swear to God.
01:14:59.536,01:15:00.871,Swear to me!
01:15:06.461,01:15:07.670,"I don't, I don't know."
01:15:07.711,01:15:09.672,I never knew. Never.
01:15:09.713,01:15:13.217,They-they went to some guy for a couple of days before they went to the dealers.
01:15:13.259,01:15:15.261,Why?
01:15:15.303,01:15:18.889,"There was something, something else in the drugs."
01:15:18.931,01:15:20.641,- Something hidden.
01:15:20.683,01:15:22.893,I never went to the drop-off point.
01:15:22.935,01:15:24.228,It was in the Narrows.
01:15:24.270,01:15:26.147,Cops only go there when they're in force.
01:15:26.189,01:15:28.232,- Do I look like a cop?
01:15:42.955,01:15:45.291,This is the one I'm talking about.
01:15:45.333,01:15:47.793,- What's your problem with it?
01:15:47.835,01:15:53.966,"This ship left Singapore with 246 containers but arrived with 247, so I'm guessing there's something I'm not supposed to find in there."
01:15:54.008,01:15:58.012,"Listen, counselor, we don't wanna know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate."
01:15:58.054,01:15:59.847,Things are working a little differently now.
01:15:59.889,01:16:01.307,Open it up.
01:16:10.774,01:16:12.026,What the hell is this?
01:16:54.944,01:16:56.237,"It's you, isn't it?"
01:16:56.279,01:17:03.244,'Everybody's been talking about you.' - 'Get in here!' - 'Don't you yell at him!' The other kids won't believe me.
01:17:26.225,01:17:28.519,Get rid of all traces.
01:17:28.561,01:17:30.938,- Better torch the whole place.
01:18:06.682,01:18:08.767,"Oh, having trouble?"
01:18:10.019,01:18:23.240,'Take a seat. Have a drink.' 'You look like a man who takes himself too seriously.' Do you want my opinion?
01:19:15.084,01:19:18.128,Alfred! Alfred!
01:19:28.639,01:19:31.392,Blood. Take. Take poison.
01:19:31.434,01:19:33.769,Blood poison. Poisonous.
01:19:33.810,01:19:41.277,'Poisonous.' Bruce.
01:19:42.737,01:19:44.405,Why do we fall?
01:19:55.625,01:19:58.419,- How long was I out?
01:19:59.462,01:20:01.255,It's your birthday.
01:20:02.548,01:20:04.216,Many happy returns.
01:20:09.096,01:20:17.730,I've felt these effects before 'but this was so much more potent.' It was some kind of hallucinogen weaponized in aerosol form.
01:20:17.772,01:20:20.857,"You have been hanging out in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne."
01:20:20.899,01:20:24.111,I called Mr. Fox when your condition worsened after the first day.
01:20:24.153,01:20:31.535,I analyzed your blood isolating the receptor compounds 'and the protein-based catalysts.' Am I meant to understand any of that?
01:20:31.577,01:20:32.911,Not at all.
01:20:32.953,01:20:35.289,I just wanted you to know how hard it was.
01:20:35.331,01:20:39.001,"'Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote.' Could you make more?"
01:20:39.042,01:20:42.087,"You planning on gassing yourself again, Mr. Wayne?"
01:20:42.129,01:20:43.673,"Well, you know how it is, Mr. Fox."
01:20:43.714,01:20:47.718,You're out at night looking for kicks someone's passing around the weaponized hallucinogens.
01:20:47.760,01:20:49.345,I'll bring what I have.
01:20:49.386,01:20:54.517,"'The antidote should inoculate you for now.' Alfred, always a pleasure."
01:20:54.558,01:20:55.892,Lucius.
01:21:00.481,01:21:01.857,You sure you don't want to come in?
01:21:01.898,01:21:04.819,I have to get back.
01:21:04.901,01:21:06.445,- Thank you.
01:21:07.988,01:21:11.283,Looks like someone's been burning the candle at both ends.
01:21:11.325,01:21:13.076,Must have been quite an occasion.
01:21:13.118,01:21:14.995,- It is my birthday.
01:21:15.037,01:21:16.622,I'm sorry I can't come tonight.
01:21:16.664,01:21:17.998,I was just dropping off your present.
01:21:18.040,01:21:19.750,You've got better plans?
01:21:19.792,01:21:25.506,My boss has been missing for two days which in this town means that I should probably start by looking at the bottom of the river.
01:21:25.548,01:21:27.257,- Rachel.
01:21:30.135,01:21:31.970,Rachel Dawes.
01:21:32.012,01:21:34.431,Who authorized that?
01:21:34.473,01:21:36.559,Do not take no for an answer.
01:21:36.600,01:21:40.020,Tell him we'll need our own assessment on the judge's desk by morning.
01:21:40.062,01:21:41.856,- What's wrong?
01:21:41.897,01:21:44.608,Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum on suicide watch.
01:21:44.650,01:21:47.611,You're going to Arkham now?
01:21:48.945,01:21:50.865,"You enjoy your party, Bruce."
01:21:50.906,01:21:53.743,- Some of us have work to do.
01:21:55.411,01:21:56.953,Happy birthday.
01:22:16.223,01:22:18.434,"But, Master Wayne, the guests will be arriving."
01:22:18.475,01:22:21.896,Keep them happy until I arrive.
01:23:01.560,01:23:03.228,Having fun?
01:23:05.481,01:23:07.232,Bill?
01:23:05.481,01:23:09.067,Now what's a big shot like you doing in a place like this?
01:23:09.109,01:23:10.527,I need some information.
01:23:10.569,01:23:15.449,The Wayne Enterprise 47B-1ME.
01:23:16.742,01:23:19.202,1ME. It's a microwave emitter.
01:23:19.244,01:23:22.122,It was designed to vaporize an enemy's water supply.
01:23:22.164,01:23:26.669,"Rumor was, they tested dispersing water-based chemical agents into the air."
01:23:26.710,01:23:28.754,But isn't that illegal?
01:23:30.422,01:23:34.635,I want all the information on the development of this project.
01:23:34.677,01:23:39.181,"All data, files, backup disks on my desk right away."
01:23:39.222,01:23:41.767,Did you lose one?
01:23:41.809,01:23:44.687,I'm merging your department with Archives..
01:23:46.689,01:23:48.565,...and I am firing you.
01:23:50.025,01:23:52.152,Didn't you get the memo?
01:23:59.368,01:24:06.041,'Scarecrow.' Scarecrow.
01:24:09.503,01:24:11.755,"Just down there, Dr. Crane."
01:24:13.757,01:24:16.051,"Miss Dawes, this is most irregular."
01:24:16.092,01:24:19.137,I have nothing further to add to the report I filed with the judge.
01:24:19.179,01:24:20.681,I have questions about your report.
01:24:20.723,01:24:21.932,Such as?
01:24:21.974,01:24:29.815,Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man who has no history of mental illness to suddenly have a complete psychotic breakdown just when he's about to be indicted?
01:24:29.857,01:24:34.486,"Well, as you can see for yourself there is nothing convenient about his symptoms."
01:24:38.198,01:24:40.701,- Scarecrow.
01:24:40.743,01:24:49.334,Patients suffering delusional episodes often focus their paranoia on an external tormentor usually one conforming to Jungian archetypes.
01:24:50.293,01:24:52.588,"In this case, a scarecrow."
01:24:54.006,01:24:55.131,He's drugged?
01:24:55.173,01:24:58.468,Psychopharmacology is my primary field.
01:24:58.510,01:25:00.679,I'm a strong advocate.
01:25:00.721,01:25:05.601,"'Outside, he was a giant.' In here, only the mind can grant you power."
01:25:05.642,01:25:07.394,You enjoy the reversal.
01:25:07.436,01:25:09.855,I respect the mind's power over the body.
01:25:10.940,01:25:12.357,It's why I do what I do.
01:25:12.399,01:25:17.571,I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone behind bars not in therapy.
01:25:17.613,01:25:22.743,"I want my own psychiatric consultant to have full access to Falcone, including blood work."
01:25:22.785,01:25:24.327,Find out what exactly you put him on.
01:25:24.369,01:25:27.372,- First thing tomorrow then.
01:25:27.414,01:25:29.959,I have already paged Dr. Lehmann at County General.
01:25:31.460,01:25:33.754,As you wish.
01:25:39.426,01:25:41.428,"This way, please."
01:25:41.470,01:25:43.722,There's something I think you should see.
01:25:54.900,01:26:06.328,'This is where we make the medicine.' Perhaps you should have some.
01:26:07.245,01:26:08.497,Clear your head.
01:26:33.480,01:26:36.150,Who knows you're here?
01:26:36.191,01:26:37.275,Who knows?
01:26:43.323,01:26:46.409,He's here.
01:26:46.451,01:26:49.621,- Who?
01:26:51.456,01:26:55.836,'What do we do?' What anyone does when a prowler comes around.
01:26:57.504,01:27:00.549,- Call the police.
01:27:00.590,01:27:03.468,"At this point, they can't stop us."
01:27:03.510,01:27:07.139,But the Batman has a talent for disruption.
01:27:07.181,01:27:10.517,Force him outside. The police will take him down. Go.
01:27:10.559,01:27:15.147,"- 'What about her?' - 'Oh, she hasn't got long.' I gave her a concentrated dose."
01:27:15.189,01:27:17.149,The mind can only take so much.
01:27:17.191,01:27:18.692,"Now, go."
01:27:20.276,01:27:24.322,"The things they say about him, can he really fly?"
01:27:24.364,01:27:29.036,"'I heard he can disappear.' Well, we'll find out.."
01:27:29.953,01:27:31.538,...won't we?
01:28:18.961,01:28:21.213,"Taste of your own medicine, doctor?"
01:28:27.677,01:28:29.387,What have you been doing here?
01:28:32.641,01:28:34.810,Who are you working for?
01:28:39.481,01:28:42.067,"Ra's, Ra's Al Ghul."
01:28:42.109,01:28:44.111,Ra's Al Ghul is dead.
01:28:44.153,01:28:48.282,"Who are you working for, Crane?"
01:28:50.659,01:28:52.786,Dr. Crane isn't here right now..
01:28:54.121,01:28:56.123,...but if you'd like to make an appointment..
01:29:08.885,01:29:21.815,"'Batman, put down your weapons and surrender.' 'You're surrounded.' - What are you waiting for?"
01:29:22.983,01:29:24.234,Backup?
01:29:24.276,01:29:26.528,The Batman's in there.
01:29:26.569,01:29:32.367,"'But if you wanna go in now, I'll be right behind you, sir.' SWAT's on the way."
01:29:33.576,01:29:35.329,- Hey!
01:30:17.120,01:30:26.255,'What's happened to her?' Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic hallucinogen a panic-inducing toxin.
01:30:27.630,01:30:28.965,Let me get her down to the medics.
01:30:29.007,01:30:31.093,"They can't help her, but I can."
01:30:34.888,01:30:36.181,Get her downstairs.
01:30:36.223,01:30:38.432,Meet me in the alley on the Narrows side.
01:30:45.399,01:30:50.404,Crane's been smuggling his toxin hidden inside Falcone's drugs and then dumping it in the water supply.
01:30:50.444,01:30:52.322,"Oh, what, what was he planning?"
01:30:52.364,01:30:54.741,- I don't know.
01:30:54.783,01:30:57.493,He mentioned someone else.
01:30:57.535,01:31:00.122,I need to get her the antidote before the damage becomes permanent.
01:31:00.163,01:31:02.165,- How long does she have?
01:31:06.253,01:31:07.879,What is that?
01:31:09.463,01:31:10.464,Backup.
01:31:10.506,01:31:11.883,What the..
01:32:30.003,01:32:31.421,Excuse me.
01:32:35.967,01:32:38.552,- How is she?
01:32:41.306,01:32:44.142,- I'll get my car.
01:32:41.306,01:32:46.395,- 'I brought mine!' Yours?
01:32:56.279,01:32:58.114,I gotta get me one of those.
01:32:59.408,01:33:03.619,"- 'He is in a vehicle.' - 'Make and color?' Uh, it's a black.."
01:33:05.247,01:33:06.206,...tank.
01:33:09.209,01:33:10.335,Stay calm.
01:33:11.253,01:33:12.712,You've been poisoned.
01:33:15.549,01:33:16.841,I'm on him.
01:33:25.517,01:33:27.018,Breathe slowly.
01:33:36.736,01:33:37.987,Hold on.
01:33:52.168,01:33:54.129,- What are you doing?
01:34:01.595,01:34:14.816,"'Air One to Ground, block that ramp!' 'He's got no way off that roof.' Turn off your engine!"
01:34:16.859,01:34:19.613,- Trust me.
01:34:16.859,01:34:39.382,- 'Weapons system activated.' Who is this guy?
01:34:39.424,01:34:41.259,- 'Where's he going?' - He's on the roof!
01:34:55.440,01:34:59.902,- 'What street is he taking?' - 'He's not on a street!' He's flying on rooftops!
01:35:38.608,01:35:41.403,At least tell me what it looks like.
01:35:43.988,01:35:45.407,Never mind.
01:35:49.244,01:35:50.328,Got him.
01:36:01.548,01:36:02.716,Coming right up on his butt.
01:36:27.823,01:36:37.083,'We're tracking suspect vehicle heading west on I-17.' - 'Air One to Ground.' - I lost him!
01:36:37.125,01:36:39.502,'We've lost visual.
01:36:37.125,01:36:46.050,Exit nine's blocked.' 'We'll move back to check the frontage road.' 'Stealth mode activated.' Stay with me.
01:36:51.889,01:36:53.807,What.. There he is!
01:37:12.910,01:37:14.663,Just hold on!
01:37:18.583,01:37:20.126,Rachel!
01:37:52.200,01:37:56.162,"'They get any of this crap into the mains?' - Oh, yeah."
01:37:56.204,01:37:57.747,There's gotta be a way of isolating the areas.
01:37:57.789,01:37:59.457,"No, you don't understand."
01:37:59.499,01:38:03.378,'They must have been at this for weeks.' Gotham's entire water supply is laced with it.
01:38:03.419,01:38:04.754,Why haven't we felt the effects?
01:38:04.796,01:38:07.340,Must be a compound that has to be absorbed through the lungs.
01:38:17.350,01:38:19.227,How do you feel?
01:38:21.730,01:38:24.940,Where are we?
01:38:24.982,01:38:27.610,"If I hadn't, your mind would now be lost."
01:38:27.652,01:38:29.028,You were poisoned.
01:38:29.070,01:38:31.155,"It was, it was Dr. Crane."
01:38:31.197,01:38:33.658,Rest. Gordon has Crane.
01:38:33.700,01:38:36.619,Is Sergeant Gordon your friend?
01:38:36.661,01:38:39.080,I don't have the luxury of friends.
01:38:39.121,01:38:42.667,I'm gonna give you a sedative.
01:38:42.709,01:38:45.754,"When you do, get these to Gordon, and Gordon alone."
01:38:45.795,01:38:47.797,- 'Trust no one.' - What are they?
01:38:47.839,01:38:52.260,The antidote. One for Gordon to inoculate himself the other for mass production.
01:38:52.301,01:38:53.927,Mass production?
01:38:53.969,01:38:56.180,Crane was just a pawn.
01:38:56.222,01:38:58.182,We need to be ready.
01:39:23.040,01:39:32.216,When you told me your grand plan for saving Gotham the only thing that stopped me from calling the men in white coats was when you said that it wasn't about thrill-seeking.
01:39:32.258,01:39:35.219,- It's not.
01:39:37.012,01:39:38.389,Damn good television.
01:39:38.431,01:39:40.141,It's a miracle no one was killed.
01:39:40.182,01:39:44.103,"I didn't have time to observe the rules of the road, Alfred."
01:39:44.145,01:39:47.398,You're getting lost inside this monster of yours.
01:39:47.440,01:39:51.903,I'm using this monster to help other people just like my father did.
01:39:51.945,01:39:57.032,"For Thomas Wayne, helping others wasn't about proving anything to anyone, including himself."
01:39:57.074,01:40:00.829,"It's Rachel, Alfred."
01:40:00.870,01:40:03.790,"She's downstairs, sedated."
01:40:03.832,01:40:05.333,"Well, we both care for Rachel, sir."
01:40:05.374,01:40:07.669,But what you're doing has to be beyond that.
01:40:07.710,01:40:10.630,It can't be personal or you're just a vigilante.
01:40:10.672,01:40:12.674,- Is Fox still here?
01:40:12.715,01:40:14.467,We need to send these people away now.
01:40:14.509,01:40:16.511,"Those are Bruce Wayne's guests out there, sir."
01:40:16.552,01:40:19.639,- You have a name to maintain.
01:40:19.681,01:40:23.225,"It's not just your name, sir."
01:40:24.686,01:40:26.771,And it's all that's left of him.
01:40:29.064,01:40:30.483,Don't destroy it.
01:40:45.915,01:40:47.040,Mr. Earle.
01:40:47.082,01:40:49.961,"- Happy birthday, Bruce."
01:40:50.003,01:40:52.129,"How'd the, uh, stock offering go?"
01:40:52.171,01:40:53.548,Prices soared.
01:40:53.589,01:40:55.048,Who was buying?
01:40:55.090,01:40:57.092,All kinds of funds and brokerages.
01:40:57.134,01:40:58.928,It's a bit technical.
01:40:58.970,01:41:03.056,The key thing is our company's future is secure.
01:41:05.226,01:41:06.561,Great.
01:41:19.490,01:41:21.868,"A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid."
01:41:27.415,01:41:31.794,"'What was the plan, Crane?' How were you gonna get your toxin into the air?"
01:41:31.836,01:41:33.629,Scarecrow.
01:41:34.338,01:41:35.631,Scarecrow.
01:41:35.673,01:41:37.926,"Who were you working for, Crane?"
01:41:39.594,01:41:42.304,"Oh, it's too late."
01:41:42.346,01:41:44.306,You can't stop it now.
01:41:49.604,01:41:51.022,Here.
01:41:51.064,01:41:52.899,"- Happy birthday, Bruce."
01:41:52.941,01:41:55.526,Thanks.
01:41:57.904,01:42:00.615,You're welcome. I know you'll put it to good use.
01:42:00.656,01:42:02.450,- I already have.
01:42:02.491,01:42:05.536,How long would it take to manufacture on a large scale?
01:42:06.704,01:42:07.997,Weeks. Why?
01:42:08.039,01:42:11.000,Somebody's planning to disperse the toxin using the water supply.
01:42:11.042,01:42:14.879,"Mnh-mnh, the water supply won't help you disperse an inhalant."
01:42:16.213,01:42:17.590,What?
01:42:17.632,01:42:22.678,Unless you have a microwave emitter powerful enough to vaporize all the water in the mains.
01:42:23.763,01:42:27.600,A microwave emitter like the one Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.
01:42:27.642,01:42:28.643,Misplaced?
01:42:28.684,01:42:32.063,Earle just fired me for asking too many questions about it.
01:42:34.315,01:42:37.986,I need you to go back to Wayne Enterprises right now and start making more of that antidote.
01:42:38.027,01:42:41.114,"I think the police are gonna need as much as they can get their hands on, okay?"
01:42:41.154,01:42:43.658,"Uh, my security clearance has been revoked."
01:42:43.699,01:42:45.910,"Well, that wouldn't stop a man like you now, would it?"
01:42:45.952,01:42:47.286,I suppose not.
01:42:49.705,01:42:54.418,"- Bruce, there's somebody here-- - Not now-- ...you simply must meet."
01:42:54.460,01:42:57.546,"Now, am I pronouncing this right?"
01:42:57.588,01:43:00.091,Mr. Ra's Al Ghul?
01:43:05.805,01:43:07.556,You're not Ra's Al Ghul.
01:43:08.891,01:43:10.309,I watched him die.
01:43:10.351,01:43:18.818,'But is Ra's Al Ghul immortal?' Are his methods supernatural?
01:43:23.280,01:43:27.743,"Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, Ra's?"
01:43:29.620,01:43:37.045,Surely a man who spends his nights scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham wouldn't begrudge me dual identities?
01:43:37.086,01:43:38.880,I saved your life.
01:43:38.921,01:43:41.590,"I warned you about compassion, Bruce."
01:43:44.802,01:43:46.762,Your quarrel is with me.
01:43:47.972,01:43:50.516,You let these people go.
01:43:50.558,01:43:53.561,You are welcome to explain the situation to them.
01:43:56.189,01:43:58.399,Everyone.
01:43:58.440,01:43:59.441,Everybody.
01:44:02.987,01:44:05.238,"I, uh.."
01:44:05.280,01:44:08.659,...wanna thank you all for coming here tonight and drinking all of my booze.
01:44:11.704,01:44:14.247,"No, really."
01:44:14.289,01:44:17.334,There's a thing about being a Wayne that..
01:44:17.376,01:44:24.675,"...you're never short of a few freeloaders 'like yourselves, to fill up your mansion with.' 'So here's to you people."
01:44:22.297,01:44:27.720,"Thank you.' - That's enough, Bruce."
01:44:27.762,01:44:43.194,"'To all of you, uh, all of you phonies' all of you...two-faced friends you sycophantic suck-ups 'who smile through your teeth at me' please...leave me in peace."
01:44:43.236,01:44:46.114,"Please, go."
01:44:46.155,01:44:49.867,Stop smiling. It's not a joke.
01:44:49.909,01:44:52.078,The party's over. Get out.
01:44:52.120,01:44:55.790,"The apple has fallen very far from the tree, Mr. Wayne."
01:45:08.970,01:45:11.055,Amusing.
01:45:11.097,01:45:12.807,But pointless.
01:45:12.848,01:45:14.516,None of these people have long to live.
01:45:14.558,01:45:18.311,Your antics at the asylum have forced my hand.
01:45:18.353,01:45:20.522,So Crane was working for you.
01:45:20.564,01:45:24.777,His toxin is derived from the organic compound found in our blue flowers.
01:45:24.819,01:45:26.904,He was able to weaponize it.
01:45:26.946,01:45:28.781,He's not a member of the League of Shadows.
01:45:28.823,01:45:31.159,Of course not.
01:45:28.823,01:45:33.286,He thought our plan was to hold the city to ransom.
01:45:34.453,01:45:39.083,"But, really, you are gonna release Crane's poison on the entire city."
01:45:39.125,01:45:43.171,Then watch Gotham tear itself apart through fear.
01:45:55.766,01:45:57.852,You're gonna destroy millions of lives.
01:45:57.893,01:46:01.480,"Only a cynical man would call what these people have lives, Wayne."
01:46:01.522,01:46:03.482,"Crime, despair."
01:46:03.524,01:46:06.110,This is not how man was supposed to live.
01:46:06.152,01:46:11.157,The League of Shadows has been a check against human corruption for thousands of years.
01:46:11.199,01:46:12.491,We sacked Rome.
01:46:12.533,01:46:15.077,Loaded trade ships with plague rats.
01:46:15.119,01:46:16.537,Burned London to the ground.
01:46:16.578,01:46:21.667,Every time a civilization reaches the pinnacle of its decadence we return to restore the balance.
01:46:21.709,01:46:24.545,Gotham isn't beyond saving.
01:46:24.586,01:46:27.340,Give me more time.
01:46:27.380,01:46:32.845,You are defending a city so corrupt we have infiltrated every level of its infrastructure.
01:46:43.689,01:46:45.274,Time to play.
01:46:49.195,01:46:54.616,"When I found you in that jail, you were lost but I believed in you."
01:46:54.658,01:46:58.287,I took away your fear and I showed you a path.
01:46:58.329,01:47:01.040,You were my greatest student.
01:47:01.082,01:47:05.044,"It should be you standing by my side, saving the world."
01:47:05.086,01:47:08.297,I'll be standing where I belong.
01:47:08.339,01:47:11.259,Between you and the people of Gotham.
01:47:13.219,01:47:15.263,No one can save Gotham.
01:47:18.933,01:47:23.020,When a forest grows too wild a purging fire is inevitable and natural.
01:47:24.772,01:47:29.860,Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself.
01:47:29.902,01:47:33.614,The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.
01:47:33.655,01:47:35.783,- You attacked Gotham before?
01:47:35.824,01:47:38.869,"Over the ages, our weapons have grown more sophisticated."
01:47:38.911,01:47:42.081,"With Gotham, we tried a new one. Economics."
01:47:42.123,01:47:46.335,But we underestimated certain of Gotham's citizens..
01:47:47.544,01:47:49.422,...such as your parents.
01:47:53.508,01:47:57.096,Gunned down by one of the very people they were trying to help.
01:47:57.138,01:48:00.099,Create enough hunger and everyone becomes a criminal.
01:48:00.141,01:48:05.771,'Their deaths galvanized the city into saving itself' and Gotham has limped on ever since.
01:48:05.813,01:48:08.274,We are back to finish the job.
01:48:08.316,01:48:15.281,"'And this time no misguided idealists' 'will get in the way.' Like your father, you lack the courage to do all that is necessary."
01:48:15.323,01:48:22.537,'If someone stands in the way of true justice' you simply walk up behind them and stab them in the heart.
01:48:27.418,01:48:28.919,I am gonna stop you.
01:48:28.961,01:48:31.339,You never did learn to mind your surroundings.
01:48:34.216,01:48:36.427,Justice is balance.
01:48:36.469,01:48:38.762,You burned my house and left me for dead.
01:48:41.265,01:48:43.516,Consider us even.
01:48:59.950,01:49:01.785,No one comes out. Make sure.
01:49:11.253,01:49:13.088,They're all gone?
01:49:13.130,01:49:14.715,How many from maximum security?
01:49:14.756,01:49:16.133,Every one of them.
01:49:16.175,01:49:18.093,"Serial killers, rapists."
01:49:18.135,01:49:19.470,Get them to raise the bridges.
01:49:19.512,01:49:21.055,We don't want any getting off the island.
01:49:21.096,01:49:22.515,"Yeah, I'll raise the bridges."
01:49:22.555,01:49:28.645,When I get every available unit out here to catch the homicidal maniacs that are running loose out there.
01:49:28.687,01:49:30.105,Come on!
01:49:53.087,01:49:55.923,I hope you're not a member of the fire brigade.
01:50:02.012,01:50:03.847,Master Wayne! Master Wayne!
01:50:08.394,01:50:12.189,What is the point of all those push-ups if you can't even lift a bloody log?
01:50:51.479,01:50:54.398,"What have I done, Alfred?"
01:50:54.440,01:50:57.901,"Everything my family, my father built.."
01:51:00.988,01:51:04.908,"The Wayne legacy is more than bricks and mortar, sir."
01:51:04.950,01:51:06.827,I wanted to save Gotham.
01:51:08.036,01:51:09.204,I failed.
01:51:11.206,01:51:13.208,"Why do we fall, sir?"
01:51:15.586,01:51:18.755,So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.
01:51:21.425,01:51:23.802,You still haven't given up on me?
01:51:25.762,01:51:27.097,Never.
01:51:28.098,01:51:29.682,Down!
01:51:29.724,01:51:34.522,"'Harassment! I see harassments!' Well, maybe you'd like to see some excessive force."
01:51:34.563,01:51:36.148,- Hey! Hey! Hey!
01:51:38.317,01:51:44.948,"'With residents furious at the unprecedented show' 'of police strength to round up the inmates..' Whoa, lady, we're about to raise these bridges."
01:51:44.990,01:51:47.993,"Officer, I am a Gotham City district attorney. Let me pass."
01:51:56.043,01:51:57.336,- Just shut up!
01:51:58.753,01:52:00.881,- Hold these people back!
01:52:00.922,01:52:03.967,There's somebody here to see you.' What are you doing here?
01:52:04.009,01:52:05.760,Our mutual friend sent me with this.
01:52:05.802,01:52:09.223,It counteracts Crane's toxin.
01:52:09.264,01:52:11.517,Not unless he's got some way of getting that crap into the air.
01:52:13.602,01:52:16.230,"All right, last one across."
01:52:16.271,01:52:22.570,"'Come on, people, they want this bridge up' 'in no more than three minutes!' We better get you off the island before they raise the bridges."
01:52:22.611,01:52:23.736,Patrolman!
01:52:25.113,01:52:26.365,Go!
01:52:52.516,01:52:55.477,- I can't find my mom.
01:52:52.516,01:53:06.655,- 'Hey!' What the hell are you doin'?
01:53:07.989,01:53:11.660,"Gentlemen, time to spread the word."
01:53:14.037,01:53:16.665,And the word is..
01:53:16.707,01:53:18.333,...panic.
01:53:41.607,01:53:44.568,Jesus.
01:53:44.610,01:53:46.403,R-right there.
01:53:46.445,01:54:07.633,'That water main is right under the Narrows.' It's okay.
01:54:40.499,01:54:42.125,This is Commissioner Loeb.
01:54:42.167,01:54:44.545,"Come on, somebody talk to me."
01:55:05.399,01:55:07.442,Loeb. Loeb. This is Gordon.
01:55:07.484,01:55:08.902,What the hell is goin' on in there?
01:55:08.943,01:55:11.363,We need reinforcements.
01:55:11.405,01:55:13.741,"- SWAT, riot cops!"
01:55:13.782,01:55:16.744,All the city's riot police are on the island with you!
01:55:16.785,01:55:22.791,"'Well, they're completely incapacitated!' It's okay. It's okay."
01:55:24.251,01:55:26.712,"- Of course, they are!"
01:55:26.754,01:55:29.005,No. Scarecrow.
01:55:30.758,01:55:34.261,"Gordon, there's nobody left to send in."
01:55:36.012,01:55:37.931,So I'm on my own?
01:55:42.018,01:55:43.437,The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.
01:55:43.478,01:55:45.021,This is just the beginning.
01:55:45.063,01:55:49.109,"If they hit the whole city with toxin, there's nothing to stop Gotham tearing itself apart from mass panic."
01:55:49.150,01:55:51.361,- How are they gonna do that?
01:55:51.403,01:55:55.532,The monorail follows the water mains to the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.
01:55:55.574,01:56:00.995,If they get their machine into Wayne Station it will cause a chain reaction that will vaporize the entire city's water supply.
01:56:01.037,01:56:02.956,Covering Gotham in this poison.
01:56:02.997,01:56:06.293,I'm gonna stop him from loading that train but I may need your help.
01:56:06.334,01:56:08.044,- What do you need?
01:56:13.967,01:56:18.346,'There you are!' There is nothing to fear..
01:56:18.388,01:56:20.974,...but fear itself!
01:56:21.015,01:56:22.476,I am here to help..
01:56:54.466,01:56:57.218,Batman will save us.
01:57:01.723,01:57:03.976,- He'll come.
01:57:12.567,01:57:15.988,This is Gordon.
01:57:21.910,01:57:23.787,I told you he'd come.
01:57:28.959,01:57:30.293,Wait!
01:57:31.586,01:57:34.756,You could die.
01:57:39.928,01:57:42.096,It's not who I am underneath..
01:57:43.223,01:57:46.643,...but what I do that defines me.
01:57:48.061,01:57:49.270,Bruce?
01:58:22.804,01:58:26.266,"Well, well, you took my advice about theatricality a bit literally."
01:58:26.307,01:58:27.601,It ends here.
01:58:27.642,01:58:31.438,"'For you and the police, maybe.' My fight, however, lies with the rest of Gotham."
01:58:31.479,01:58:34.983,"Now, if you'll excuse me I have a city to destroy."
01:58:35.025,01:58:36.818,I can't beat two of your pawns?
01:58:36.860,01:58:38.403,As you wish.
01:58:51.666,01:59:35.293,'GPS online.' 'In 100 yards..' Gentlemen.
02:00:02.654,02:00:04.823,Who the hell authorized this?
02:00:15.042,02:00:27.303,"'Distance to Wayne Tower, 3 miles.' The pressure's moving along the mains blowing all the pipes."
02:00:27.345,02:00:32.308,"And if that pressure reaches us, the water supply right across the whole city is gonna blow!"
02:00:42.194,02:01:11.598,"'At the next intersection, turn right.' You will never learn."
02:01:16.061,02:01:17.812,Whoa!
02:01:19.397,02:01:20.899,Sorry.
02:01:24.152,02:01:26.029,Familiar.
02:01:26.071,02:01:28.031,How about this?
02:01:43.755,02:02:15.453,'You have arrived at Wayne Tower.' Evacuate the building. We're right on top of the main hub 'and it's gonna blow.' 'Weapons system activated.' Whoa!
02:02:18.498,02:02:19.624,Nice ride.
02:02:34.639,02:02:49.403,"'Armed.' Don't be afraid, Bruce."
02:02:52.157,02:02:54.159,Come on. Come on.
02:02:58.371,02:03:00.332,You are just an ordinary man in a cape.
02:03:00.373,02:03:04.252,That's why you couldn't fight injustice and that's why you can't stop this train.
02:03:04.294,02:03:06.963,Who said anything about stopping it?
02:03:12.802,02:03:14.262,Yes!
02:03:17.849,02:03:19.184,Whoa.
02:03:22.395,02:03:25.690,You never learned to mind your surroundings.
02:03:33.823,02:03:36.576,Have you finally learned to do what is necessary?
02:03:36.617,02:03:38.786,I won't kill you.
02:03:43.541,02:03:45.626,But I don't have to save you.
02:05:00.743,02:05:04.205,- The meeting's already started.
02:05:04.247,02:05:05.915,Th-the m..
02:05:08.126,02:05:11.421,"Fox, I seem to remember firing you."
02:05:11.463,02:05:14.507,You did. I got another job.
02:05:16.134,02:05:18.136,Yours.
02:05:18.178,02:05:20.096,On whose authority?
02:05:20.138,02:05:25.059,'Batman may have made the front page' but Bruce Wayne got pushed to page eight.
02:05:32.025,02:05:33.193,Bruce Wayne.
02:05:33.234,02:05:37.280,What makes you think you can decide who's running Wayne Enterprises?
02:05:37.322,02:05:38.614,"Well, the fact that I'm the owner."
02:05:38.656,02:05:42.410,'What're you talking about?' The company went public a week ago.
02:05:42.452,02:05:55.089,"And I bought most of the shares 'through various charitable foundations' 'and trusts and so forth.' Look, it's all a bit technical but the important thing is that my company's future is secure."
02:05:55.131,02:05:58.009,"- Right, Mr. Fox?"
02:05:55.131,02:06:02.722,"- 'Right you are, Mr. Wayne.' Didn't you get the memo?"
02:06:21.157,02:06:24.494,"I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel-- No. No, Bruce."
02:06:24.536,02:06:26.996,I'm sorry.
02:06:27.038,02:06:29.207,"The day that Chill died, I.."
02:06:31.501,02:06:33.503,...I said terrible things.
02:06:33.545,02:06:35.963,But true things.
02:06:36.005,02:06:37.882,I was a coward with a gun.
02:06:37.924,02:06:41.719,"Justice is about more than revenge, so thank you."
02:06:42.845,02:06:44.931,I never stopped thinking about you.
02:06:47.016,02:06:49.185,About us.
02:06:49.227,02:06:52.105,"And when I heard you were back, I.."
02:06:52.146,02:06:54.065,...I started to hope.
02:07:18.298,02:07:20.758,But then I found out about your mask.
02:07:21.968,02:07:24.345,"Batman's just a symbol, Rachel."
02:07:25.597,02:07:27.140,"No, this.."
02:07:28.308,02:07:30.184,...is your mask.
02:07:32.228,02:07:35.565,Your real face is the one that criminals now fear.
02:07:36.649,02:07:39.152,The man I loved..
02:07:39.193,02:07:41.946,...the man who vanished..
02:07:41.988,02:07:44.157,...he never came back at all.
02:07:48.536,02:07:51.164,But maybe he's still out there somewhere.
02:07:53.416,02:07:56.961,Maybe someday when Gotham no longer needs Batman..
02:07:58.171,02:08:00.131,...I'll see him again.
02:08:11.058,02:08:13.853,"- Proved me wrong, you know."
02:08:16.939,02:08:19.567,Your father would be very proud of you.
02:08:19.609,02:08:21.319,Just like me.
02:08:48.054,02:08:53.643,'What will you do?' Rebuild it.
02:08:53.685,02:08:56.229,"Just the way it was, brick for brick."
02:09:03.069,02:09:05.279,"Just the way it was, sir?"
02:09:06.406,02:09:07.740,"Yeah, why?"
02:09:07.781,02:09:13.287,"I thought this might be a good opportunity for, uh, improving the foundations."
02:09:13.329,02:09:16.457,- In the southeast corner.
02:09:32.181,02:09:33.224,Nice.
02:09:33.266,02:09:35.602,I couldn't find any mob bosses.
02:09:35.643,02:09:38.688,"- Well, sergeant?"
02:09:38.730,02:09:40.523,You really started something.
02:09:40.565,02:09:42.650,Bent cops running scared.
02:09:42.692,02:09:44.485,Hope on the streets.
02:09:44.527,02:09:45.528,But?
02:09:45.570,02:09:48.489,The Narrows is lost.
02:09:48.531,02:09:52.993,And we still haven't picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.
02:09:53.035,02:09:54.954,We will.
02:09:54.995,02:09:56.623,We can bring Gotham back.
02:09:56.664,02:09:59.292,- What about escalation?
02:09:59.333,02:10:03.963,We start carrying semi-automatics they buy automatics.
02:10:04.004,02:10:08.301,We start wearing Kevlar they buy armor-piercing rounds.
02:10:08.342,02:10:09.385,And?
02:10:09.427,02:10:15.266,And you're wearing a mask jumping off rooftops.
02:10:15.308,02:10:17.769,"Now, take this guy."
02:10:17.810,02:10:19.895,"Armed robbery, double homicide."
02:10:19.937,02:10:23.274,Got a...taste for the theatrical like you.
02:10:23.316,02:10:32.992,'Leaves a calling card.' I'll look into it.
02:10:36.663,02:10:38.623,I never said thank you.
02:10:43.252,02:10:45.171,And you'll never have to.
