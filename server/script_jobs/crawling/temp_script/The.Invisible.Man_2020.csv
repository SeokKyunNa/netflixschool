00:07:46.716,00:07:49.051,"Zeus, I'm sorry. I can't take you with me."
00:07:51.471,00:07:52.388,I'm sorry.
00:07:56.184,00:07:59.061,Shit. I'm not gonna leave you with that thing on.
00:07:59.145,00:08:00.146,Okay.
00:08:00.855,00:08:02.231,Come here. It's okay. Good boy.
00:08:02.732,00:08:03.900,Come here. There you go.
00:08:05.818,00:08:06.652,Come here.
00:08:59.497,00:09:00.331,Fuck!
00:09:01.582,00:09:03.334,"Emily, where are you?"
00:09:06.337,00:09:07.380,Shit.
00:09:59.098,00:10:00.016,Are you okay?
00:10:01.475,00:10:02.476,I'll explain later.
00:10:03.102,00:10:04.186,"Just go, Emily."
00:10:04.270,00:10:05.354,Go!
00:10:13.321,00:10:14.697,Open the door!
00:10:16.866,00:10:18.784,Cecilia! Get back here!
00:11:25.643,00:11:27.770,-How long have you been up? -Few hours.
00:11:27.853,00:11:29.105,Can't sleep.
00:11:29.772,00:11:33.359,"Well, you know, if you close your eyes and you lie down, that usually helps."
00:11:37.655,00:11:40.241,"Um, don't think being tired gets you out of our little deal, now."
00:11:41.742,00:11:44.995,I swore to your sister I'd get you to step outside my house.
00:11:46.539,00:11:47.623,"Hey, Cee."
00:11:49.667,00:11:50.793,He's not out there.
00:11:51.293,00:11:52.670,I promise.
00:12:46.849,00:12:52.313,"I'm sorry, I'm just… I'm not ready yet."
00:12:52.396,00:12:53.397,"Hey, it's okay, Cee."
00:12:53.898,00:12:56.942,"That's the furthest you've gone since you've been here, okay?"
00:12:57.026,00:12:59.528,"So, as far as I'm concerned, you just walked on the moon."
00:13:39.568,00:13:40.486,It's all right.
00:13:40.986,00:13:41.820,I got it.
00:13:44.448,00:13:45.366,I got it.
00:13:52.998,00:13:55.251,Do I know you? Do I owe you money?
00:13:55.793,00:13:57.169,-A lot. -A lot?
00:13:57.253,00:13:59.004,I told y'all about running up on me in my house.
00:14:03.300,00:14:04.885,tell her she can't take you back.
00:14:04.969,00:14:05.886,We're keeping you.
00:14:06.470,00:14:07.721,"What are you doing here, Emily?"
00:14:09.390,00:14:11.392,"Well, it's nice to see you too, sis."
00:14:15.271,00:14:16.230,-Just… -Mmm.
00:14:16.313,00:14:17.231,Yeah.
00:14:18.732,00:14:19.608,This is not fair.
00:14:20.651,00:14:22.987,I asked you not to come over.
00:14:23.070,00:14:25.322,He knows where you live. He will follow you.
00:14:25.406,00:14:26.532,Yes.
00:14:26.615,00:14:30.286,"Well, I have some news… There is no news that justifies this."
00:14:30.369,00:14:34.456,"Okay. I have a plan, and I just… I need you to, to go along with it."
00:14:35.291,00:14:37.293,And just not be in control for one second.
00:14:37.877,00:14:39.753,"I'm not trying to control you, boo."
00:14:39.837,00:14:47.720,I'm desperately trying to tell you that you don't need to cut me off anymore… because he's dead.
00:14:51.682,00:14:52.683,What?
00:15:04.653,00:15:05.863,What?
00:15:21.795,00:15:22.630,Hey.
00:15:24.465,00:15:25.966,What did he do to you?
00:15:26.842,00:15:28.344,Can you talk to me?
00:16:12.805,00:16:17.059,"He was, he was, he was in complete control of everything, you know?"
00:16:19.603,00:16:20.938,Including me.
00:16:21.605,00:16:28.028,He controlled how I looked and what I wore and what I ate.
00:16:31.699,00:16:42.459,"And… Then it was controlling when I left the house, and… what I said."
00:16:43.502,00:16:47.047,And eventually… what I thought.
00:16:51.510,00:17:07.234,"And if… If he didn't like what he assumed I was thinking… He… He would, he would hit you?"
00:17:09.570,00:17:10.988,Amongst other things.
00:17:13.198,00:17:14.533,He wanted to have a baby.
00:17:15.617,00:17:26.003,"And I knew that if we did that, that I… I would never be able to get away from him, so… I took birth control without him knowing it."
00:17:27.463,00:17:35.888,"But, um, that can only go on for so long, so… I called you."
00:17:37.848,00:17:38.932,Hey.
00:17:43.062,00:17:44.521,You're here with us now.
00:17:45.773,00:17:46.857,And you're safe.
00:17:48.525,00:17:49.485,He's gone.
00:18:17.763,00:18:19.515,I'm not telling you to aim low.
00:18:19.598,00:18:21.934,"I'm just saying, explore more than one option, okay?"
00:18:22.017,00:18:24.770,Don't limit your choices to just one school in the whole country.
00:18:24.853,00:18:28.732,But that one school is my goal. Parsons is my goal.
00:18:28.816,00:18:32.194,"Yeah, I told you to have goals… Plural."
00:18:34.613,00:18:37.324,"I think it's important to have goals, James."
00:18:38.075,00:18:39.368,"Oh, hey."
00:18:40.369,00:18:43.288,"Look at you, getting out into the world."
00:18:43.372,00:18:45.749,"Yo, by next year, you'll make it across the street."
00:18:50.587,00:18:53.006,"Uh, hey, Cee. Something came for you."
00:18:56.009,00:18:57.427,No one knows I'm here.
00:19:28.000,00:19:30.002,Thank you both for coming in.
00:19:31.461,00:19:39.511,"As the appointed attorney representing my late brother's discretionary trust, I'm required to enact his final wishes."
00:19:40.137,00:19:42.139,And he stipulated that I do this in person.
00:19:42.723,00:19:45.267,He wanted me to read a prepared statement.
00:19:52.566,00:20:04.995,"Cecilia, although our relationship was far from perfect, I at least thought we had built up enough trust that you would talk to me rather than running away from-- No. No! Sorry, you're not allowed to do that."
00:20:05.871,00:20:08.373,-I'm required to read this. -She's not required to listen.
00:20:08.457,00:20:10.584,"E-mail me a copy, and we will read it."
00:20:11.418,00:20:12.252,You bet.
00:20:12.336,00:20:13.212,I'm just trying to do my job.
00:20:13.295,00:20:15.881,Your job is to explain the money you mentioned on the phone.
00:20:15.964,00:20:19.218,"I mentioned Cecilia, specifically, is named in Adrian's trust."
00:20:19.301,00:20:20.677,-That is why we're sitting here. -Yes.
00:20:20.761,00:20:25.474,For the same reason so many women in Adrian's life got close to him… his money.
00:20:25.557,00:20:29.436,"If there was a chance of physically being close to him, we would not be here for any amount of money."
00:20:29.519,00:20:31.104,You are physically close to him.
00:20:33.315,00:20:34.608,He's in that urn over there.
00:20:38.445,00:20:46.119,"And as per his final wishes, you're getting five million dollars… estate and income tax-free."
00:20:47.412,00:20:53.627,"Now, the money will be staggered in installments of 100,000 dollars each month for the next four years or so."
00:20:53.710,00:20:55.629,"Contingent, of course, on the fine print."
00:20:56.255,00:20:58.215,"you can't commit a crime, etcetera."
00:20:58.298,00:21:03.512,"Normally, I would have a 120-day contestability period, but I'm gonna waive my rights in that regard."
00:21:03.595,00:21:11.770,"So, as soon as I have your signature and your banking information, I can start releasing the funds."
00:21:33.625,00:21:34.793,Okay.
00:21:39.047,00:21:41.091,-Ta-da! -Oh.
00:21:41.675,00:21:43.385,"Wow. Thanks, Cee."
00:21:43.468,00:21:45.095,"Wow, that's nice. Look at that."
00:21:48.974,00:21:50.684,I know I didn't hear you just say that.
00:21:50.767,00:21:52.394,"-I meant to say, Thank you. -Uh-huh."
00:21:52.477,00:21:53.687,You're welcome.
00:21:53.770,00:21:59.067,"Well, I knew you needed a new one, and that one just… -That has to go. -That's so nice of you, Cee."
00:21:59.151,00:22:00.902,Thank you so much. That's very sweet of you.
00:22:00.986,00:22:12.831,"-Thank you. -I just… I wanted to thank you for, you know, letting me stay here and for taking such good care of me, so… And Sydney can also use ladders."
00:22:12.914,00:22:14.750,Don't think I'm helping you paint.
00:22:16.668,00:22:20.172,"No, not for, like, painting, obviously, but just for a lot of things."
00:22:20.255,00:22:22.758,"You climb them to get things. Like, stuff like that."
00:22:24.468,00:22:25.677,"God, I wish you had, like… Oh, wait!"
00:22:25.761,00:22:27.804,-You could totally use the ladder… -A ladder to climb up.
00:22:28.305,00:22:29.264,-Yeah. The ladder's cool. -Okay.
00:22:29.347,00:22:32.976,"This happened to just pop-up here by itself… It happened to be here, so it's convenient."
00:22:33.060,00:22:34.770,-Wow. -What is it?
00:22:34.853,00:22:36.438,-It has my name on it. -That's weird.
00:22:36.521,00:22:39.191,-And it looks like your handwriting. -I don't… You sure it's weird?
00:22:39.274,00:22:42.986,"I just got a ladder, so I don't know what… -Yeah. -Let's see."
00:22:43.070,00:22:44.404,A cool ladder is all.
00:22:49.826,00:22:54.456,"And I'm gonna put 10,000 dollars in it every month for the rest of the year."
00:22:55.540,00:22:57.459,I called the account Parsons.
00:23:03.256,00:23:04.925,"You're going to fashion school, kid."
00:23:05.008,00:23:09.513,"Hey, whoa, Cee, that's… That's too much, Cee. Come on. Are you sure you can do that?"
00:23:09.596,00:23:10.597,Let me put it this way.
00:23:11.264,00:23:13.100,"She can probably go to grad school, too."
00:23:16.812,00:23:18.730,-You're going to Parsons. -You're going to Parsons.
00:23:19.439,00:23:20.398,"Oh, my god."
00:23:21.066,00:23:26.822,"Oh. Wait, no. We gotta… We gotta celebrate. And I don't want TV dinners, -microwave nothing. -Oh!"
00:23:26.905,00:23:30.700,"It's like, I guess… We don't have anything at all to celebrate with."
00:23:34.746,00:23:38.458,"I don't know why you dancing. You can't have none -because you're not 21. -Yes, I can."
00:23:38.542,00:23:40.210,"Oh, come on. Just, like, a little bit."
00:23:40.293,00:23:42.712,He said the other day that I was mature for my age.
00:23:42.796,00:23:44.047,-That's right. -He did.
00:23:44.131,00:23:45.423,-A mature child. -I heard you say that.
00:23:45.507,00:23:46.716,"-I remember. -Hey, hold up."
00:23:46.800,00:23:48.301,"This ain't fair, okay? Two against one."
00:23:48.385,00:23:50.095,I'm just an innocent man trying to do right.
00:23:50.178,00:23:51.763,-Are you scared? -This is abuse. I'm a cop.
00:23:51.847,00:23:52.848,You realize I'm a cop?
00:23:53.890,00:23:54.724,-I got him. -Hey!
00:23:56.852,00:23:58.687,"I got him, Sydney! I got him!"
00:25:28.985,00:25:29.986,Morning.
00:25:30.904,00:25:31.988,You want some breakfast?
00:25:32.530,00:25:33.949,"No. No, I gotta go."
00:25:34.783,00:25:37.786,"You know, I'm a little hungover, believe it or not."
00:25:37.869,00:25:39.287,Oh. Me too.
00:25:40.330,00:25:42.249,Champagne does that to me every time.
00:25:48.213,00:25:51.633,"All right, look, I'm out of here. Um, I'll be back around 7:00."
00:25:51.716,00:25:52.634,-Okay. -All right.
00:25:53.343,00:25:54.970,"-Oh. Uh, Cee? -Hmm?"
00:25:55.053,00:25:56.513,You mind getting Sydney up?
00:25:57.097,00:25:58.640,"She's actually pretty excited, thanks to you."
00:25:58.723,00:26:01.643,"She, uh… She might need a little help staying focused."
00:26:12.946,00:26:15.573,"Syd, come on, girl. You're gonna be late."
00:26:41.516,00:26:44.185,"Shit! Shit, shit!"
00:26:44.269,00:26:45.228,Shit!
00:26:45.812,00:26:48.064,No. Don't use water.
00:26:48.148,00:26:49.816,-No. -Excuse me. Sorry.
00:27:02.412,00:27:03.580,Oh.
00:27:03.663,00:27:04.664,Wow.
00:27:08.084,00:27:09.002,You did that.
00:27:09.085,00:27:10.086,Yeah.
00:27:12.255,00:27:13.089,-No. -No?
00:27:13.173,00:27:14.507,No. Sorry.
00:28:21.282,00:28:22.325,James?
00:34:42.413,00:34:43.414,James!
00:34:43.498,00:34:44.707,James! James!
00:34:46.125,00:34:47.794,-What happened? What? -I saw something right there.
00:34:47.877,00:34:50.129,They're right there. There were footprints. I saw it!
00:34:50.213,00:34:54.217,"-You saw footprints? -Yes, I saw… On the sheets! I saw it, right there!"
00:34:54.801,00:34:55.718,I saw them.
00:34:56.260,00:34:57.178,On the sheet?
00:35:00.348,00:35:02.100,There's someone in here. There was someone in here.
00:35:02.683,00:35:03.810,"Syd, put that stupid thing away."
00:35:03.893,00:35:05.478,You're the one who bought it for me!
00:35:05.561,00:35:07.063,Who you gonna spray? Who?
00:35:08.731,00:35:09.857,"James, I saw it."
00:35:12.193,00:35:13.319,I swear.
00:35:13.402,00:35:15.363,"Hey, Cee."
00:35:18.699,00:35:20.535,Adrian will haunt you if you let him.
00:35:21.786,00:35:22.912,Don't let him.
00:35:26.165,00:35:27.667,"Now, you should try and get some sleep."
00:35:28.751,00:35:40.054,"You have an important job interview tomorrow, and I don't want the memory of this… That… This person to ruin it."
00:35:41.013,00:35:42.098,-Okay? -Okay.
00:35:43.057,00:35:44.058,Sorry.
00:35:52.859,00:35:56.237,"After Cal Poly, I worked in Paris for six months."
00:35:56.320,00:35:58.322,That was the best time of my life for sure.
00:35:59.866,00:36:02.994,"-Except for this next phase, of course. -Take a seat."
00:36:06.622,00:36:09.041,"So, any reason you worked in Paris in particular?"
00:36:09.125,00:36:12.044,Is that where all the beautiful women in the world have to go as a rule?
00:36:14.338,00:36:18.342,"Well, I speak a little French, and I've always wanted to live there."
00:36:18.926,00:36:23.764,"So, after I graduated, I went out there on a totally student budget."
00:36:24.682,00:36:26.767,"I slept in a broom closet, literally."
00:36:26.851,00:36:29.353,"I started this firm in a supply closet, literally."
00:36:30.855,00:36:32.815,"So, we both know the value of closet space."
00:36:32.899,00:36:34.066,Yeah.
00:36:37.236,00:36:38.404,Let me see some of your work.
00:36:53.794,00:37:06.057,"Um… I don't, uh… I know that I… I know I put them in here, so I apologize. I don't know what happened."
00:37:06.140,00:37:07.183,-Uh… -It's okay.
00:37:07.725,00:37:10.144,"Uh, you can send it to us, whenever you get a chance."
00:37:10.645,00:37:12.146,Okay.
00:37:12.230,00:37:14.148,"So, uh, let me tell you about us."
00:37:14.649,00:37:17.777,"At Ruler, we approach architecture on a human level."
00:37:17.860,00:37:22.949,First and… Are you okay?
00:37:25.409,00:37:28.204,Um… I'm sorry.
00:37:28.871,00:37:40.841,"Uh, I'm just not feeling… Would you like some water, or… Are you feeling okay?"
00:38:00.236,00:38:01.237,Cecilia.
00:38:01.737,00:38:06.867,"Okay, so, uh… you probably shouldn't drive or operate any heavy machinery for the next few days."
00:38:06.951,00:38:09.412,"But, other than that, you seem fine."
00:38:10.538,00:38:14.542,Either myself or my admitting will follow up with you with the results of the blood test.
00:38:14.625,00:38:15.751,Okay?
00:38:15.835,00:38:17.670,Can you just leave a number with the nurse?
00:38:17.753,00:38:18.879,You guys can go home.
00:38:18.963,00:38:19.880,Okay.
00:38:22.758,00:38:23.843,You ready?
00:38:24.385,00:38:25.594,Yeah.
00:38:58.419,00:38:59.503,That's me.
00:38:59.587,00:39:02.798,"Hi. Uh, this is Doctor Lee at St. Vincent's."
00:39:03.883,00:39:11.682,"So, we got the results of your blood test back, and it looks like the Diazepam was the most likely cause of you fainting."
00:39:11.766,00:39:14.101,"Um, sorry, what Diazepam?"
00:39:14.769,00:39:17.772,"Well, your blood work showed a very high amount of it."
00:39:18.314,00:39:20.816,That would definitely explain what happened to you.
00:39:23.361,00:39:59.271,"There's something else I wanted to talk to you about, but I'm not sure if we should do it over the phone, so, um… Tell him to stop what he's doing."
00:40:00.272,00:40:02.024,Do you know what she's babbling about?
00:40:02.108,00:40:04.443,"Nah, she hasn't explained to me why we're here yet."
00:40:04.527,00:40:07.988,"But being her very good friend, I know it's a good reason."
00:40:08.072,00:40:10.074,"So, I'm gonna need you to sit up and listen."
00:40:10.157,00:40:11.283,Show a little respect.
00:40:16.664,00:40:23.963,"One night, I was sitting, and I was thinking about… how to leave Adrian."
00:40:25.965,00:40:28.342,I was planning the whole thing in my mind.
00:40:29.510,00:40:31.053,And he was staring at me.
00:40:32.471,00:40:33.556,Studying me.
00:40:36.016,00:40:42.398,And without me saying a single word… he said that I could never leave him.
00:40:44.400,00:40:48.279,"That wherever I went, he would find me."
00:40:50.322,00:41:01.584,That he would walk right up to me and I wouldn't be able to see him… but that he would leave me a sign so that I'd know he was there.
00:41:09.800,00:41:13.637,"The night I left him, I drugged him with that."
00:41:14.346,00:41:15.973,I lost the bottle that night.
00:41:17.057,00:41:20.019,"And somehow, it found its way back to me."
00:41:22.271,00:41:24.106,"So, what exactly are you saying?"
00:41:24.190,00:41:27.234,"You lost the bottle, you found the bottle."
00:41:30.029,00:41:31.447,"He's not dead, Tom."
00:41:36.035,00:41:40.623,"I have a pile of ashes in a box that would disagree with you, Cecilia."
00:41:42.291,00:41:43.709,I don't know how he's done it.
00:41:46.337,00:41:47.588,"He's figured it out, though."
00:41:50.549,00:41:54.011,He has figured out a way to be invisible.
00:41:59.266,00:42:02.311,He is a world leader in the field of optics.
00:42:02.394,00:42:04.563,"I, I, I know that he could do this."
00:42:08.442,00:42:11.237,Something tells me you know exactly what I'm talking about.
00:42:13.948,00:42:15.658,He's not dead.
00:42:18.953,00:42:20.329,I just can't see him.
00:42:21.956,00:42:23.415,Please tell him to stop.
00:42:27.545,00:42:28.546,Okay.
00:42:29.380,00:42:34.552,"No, I agree with you, Adrian was brilliant, but it wasn't because of anything he invented."
00:42:34.635,00:42:36.470,It was how he got in people's heads.
00:42:37.263,00:42:40.266,"That was his true genius, knowing people's weaknesses."
00:42:41.934,00:42:42.935,You think about it.
00:42:43.018,00:42:46.063,"He came up with the perfect way to torture you, even in death."
00:42:47.523,00:42:54.113,"Only thing more brilliant than inventing something that makes you invisible is not inventing it, but making you think he did."
00:42:56.615,00:42:59.535,"My brother controlled me long before he met you, Cecilia."
00:43:00.452,00:43:01.453,I hated him.
00:43:02.454,00:43:04.081,"You and I, we got that in common."
00:43:13.716,00:43:15.342,when I heard that he was dead.
00:43:23.976,00:43:26.687,"He's gone, Cecilia. I saw his body."
00:43:29.148,00:43:30.190,Listen to me.
00:43:33.152,00:43:35.279,Don't let him win by bringing him back to life.
00:44:06.352,00:44:07.353,Hey.
00:44:08.562,00:44:09.396,Hey.
00:44:11.940,00:44:13.776,"Emily, I need to talk to you."
00:44:13.859,00:44:15.819,"Well, at least now we have clarity."
00:44:16.779,00:44:18.697,Now I know what you really think of me.
00:44:19.281,00:44:27.748,-What? -Thanks so much for carving out the time to let me know how suffocating I am to you.
00:44:28.332,00:44:33.337,"-What… What are you… -Not that I should have to say this, but I never expected any of that money."
00:44:36.173,00:44:38.676,"Emily, I don't… I don't know what you're talking about."
00:44:40.177,00:44:42.680,The e-mail. The e-mail you sent me this morning.
00:44:42.763,00:44:47.810,"-What e-mail? -If that's how you feel about me, don't ask me to bail you out of your personal life anymore."
00:44:47.893,00:44:55.150,"If you're too stupid to know who the good guys are and too weak to get away from the bad ones, don't sob to me for charity."
00:44:55.734,00:44:58.654,-I'm out. -I didn't send you the fucking e-mail.
00:45:00.030,00:45:00.864,I didn't.
00:45:01.448,00:45:04.284,Someone is doing this to me.
00:45:05.285,00:45:07.454,He's… He's doing this to me.
00:45:08.789,00:45:13.794,Who's… Adrian?
00:45:16.922,00:45:19.049,Adrian sent me the e-mail. Okay.
00:45:23.262,00:45:25.431,You need some medication. Adrian is dead.
00:45:26.306,00:45:27.641,"Em, please, no."
00:47:03.946,00:47:05.072,"It's okay, Syd."
00:47:07.115,00:47:08.450,You know what I think we need?
00:47:09.326,00:47:16.333,"Um… I think we could kick Dad out, and… have a little girls' night."
00:47:16.875,00:47:18.126,Eat some cake.
00:47:25.968,00:47:26.969,Yeah.
00:47:27.594,00:47:28.679,I do like cake.
00:47:34.768,00:47:35.936,"Oh, my god."
00:47:36.019,00:47:40.941,"-Sydney, are you okay? -Why would you just… -Stop! Dad! -What? No."
00:47:43.860,00:47:44.778,She hit me.
00:47:47.531,00:47:48.532,"James, I did not do that."
00:47:48.615,00:47:50.951,"Sydney, I would never hit you. I love you."
00:47:51.034,00:47:53.161,"I would never do that, James. It was him."
00:47:53.245,00:47:55.706,"-He's here, I swear to you. -Enough. Enough!"
00:47:55.789,00:47:57.124,"Cee, enough."
00:47:58.875,00:48:00.627,-Are you okay? -I don't wanna stay here.
00:48:00.711,00:48:02.462,"-Sydney, I'm sorry. I would never… -Hey, hey."
00:48:03.255,00:48:07.009,"Cee, right now, my priority is getting my baby somewhere safe."
00:48:07.092,00:48:08.093,Do you understand?
00:48:08.594,00:48:10.220,"Come on, baby. It's okay."
00:48:10.304,00:48:11.972,"No. James, please."
00:48:12.514,00:48:13.724,This is what he wants.
00:48:13.807,00:48:15.642,This is what he used to do when we were together.
00:48:15.726,00:48:18.645,He wants you to think that I did it. This is what he does.
00:48:18.729,00:48:22.316,He tries to isolate me and he tries to get me alone-- Hey!
00:48:22.399,00:48:24.693,You need to calm down. You are scaring my daughter.
00:48:26.194,00:48:28.113,"Now, if I were you, I would go to your sister's place."
00:48:28.196,00:48:29.906,You don't need to be here right now.
00:48:32.951,00:48:34.036,"Come on, Sydney."
00:48:35.537,00:48:36.913,"Sydney, I'm sorry. Sydney."
00:48:51.970,00:48:53.013,Where are you?
00:48:55.265,00:48:56.099,Come on!
00:48:59.895,00:49:01.647,Where are you? Come on out.
00:49:02.731,00:49:03.940,Don't hit a little girl.
00:49:04.524,00:49:05.609,Hit me!
00:49:08.904,00:49:09.821,Okay.
00:50:01.248,00:50:02.999,"So, why me, Adrian?"
00:50:09.005,00:50:10.841,You could have any woman you wanted.
00:50:16.346,00:50:18.890,That's the sad reality. Right?
00:50:19.975,00:50:22.978,And that's what money and power buy you.
00:50:24.771,00:50:25.772,People.
00:50:30.986,00:50:35.532,So… Why me?
00:50:38.952,00:50:45.542,I'm just a suburban girl who… stumbled into your life one night at a party.
00:50:51.506,00:50:54.843,Can't you just forget I ever existed?
00:51:00.807,00:51:05.437,There's nothing left for you to take.
00:51:13.278,00:51:15.197,You've already taken it all.
00:52:37.654,00:52:39.906,"Please leave a message, and I'll get back to you when I can."
01:00:50.521,01:00:51.689,"Please, hurry."
01:00:52.273,01:00:53.858,-Lock the doors. Lock the doors! -You okay?
01:00:53.941,01:00:55.526,"Yes. Please. Please, just go. Please."
01:01:02.909,01:01:04.160,"Hurry, please."
01:01:09.874,01:01:12.377,Stinson Beach? That's a long way from here.
01:02:00.133,01:02:01.342,Do you mind waiting for me?
01:02:01.843,01:02:07.724,"I might be two minutes, I might be twenty. I don't know, but… you can bring me back to the city after."
01:02:08.307,01:02:09.726,"-Sure, no problem. -Okay."
01:03:09.702,01:03:11.579,Hi.
01:04:12.557,01:04:15.768,12-14-17.
01:04:18.020,01:04:19.313,The day we met.
01:04:32.410,01:04:33.744,So romantic.
01:08:33.859,01:08:37.488,"Please, meet me tonight, if you can, in a public place."
01:08:38.322,01:08:39.740,Eight o'clock at Yulan.
01:08:39.824,01:08:46.122,"And if you can't, I understand, but you have to tell me because I have to call someone else, because I don't think I have much time left."
01:08:48.958,01:08:51.252,Thank you.
01:09:34.128,01:09:35.337,Hi.
01:09:36.672,01:09:38.090,Hey.
01:09:40.843,01:09:43.262,"My name is Taylor, and I will be taking care of you this evening."
01:09:43.762,01:09:44.930,Do you know how this place works?
01:09:45.014,01:09:46.807,"I'm assuming you order food, then you eat it."
01:09:46.891,01:09:49.560,Hmm. Pretty much. We just do things a little bit differently.
01:09:49.643,01:09:51.687,-It's all family style. -We've been here before.
01:09:51.770,01:09:52.605,It's all good.
01:09:52.688,01:09:54.523,Okay. Can I get you started with some water?
01:09:54.607,01:09:56.567,-We have still or sparkling. -Just the free kind.
01:09:56.650,01:09:58.277,"-Okay, tap it is. -Cool."
01:10:02.072,01:10:03.490,Thank you for being here.
01:10:07.036,01:10:08.120,I love you.
01:10:10.873,01:10:25.638,"You're like a cop, Emily, and you have this brute-force strength that is so… so comforting when I'm in trouble and it is really intimidating when I'm not."
01:10:26.972,01:10:32.061,"I mean, James actually is a six-foot cop, and he's, I think, really intimidated by you."
01:10:32.645,01:10:34.146,As he should be. I'd kick his ass.
01:10:36.857,01:10:38.525,I would.
01:10:38.609,01:10:39.443,You would.
01:10:41.946,01:10:45.950,I need that strength in my life right now.
01:10:47.660,01:10:50.287,And I need you to believe what I'm about to tell you.
01:10:53.874,01:11:01.799,"Okay. What… Thank you, Taylor."
01:11:07.388,01:11:08.889,-with the drink menu? -Yes.
01:11:08.973,01:11:10.349,Lots more time.
01:11:15.896,01:11:23.028,Emily… I went to his house today.
01:11:23.112,01:11:24.613,You went to Adrian's house?
01:11:24.697,01:11:26.031,Yes.
01:11:26.740,01:11:27.908,I just walked right in.
01:11:28.784,01:11:33.247,I found something that can prove what I'm experiencing.
01:11:33.330,01:11:38.085,That can prove that Adrian is stalking me.
01:11:39.461,01:11:40.462,What is it?
01:11:41.672,01:11:44.550,It's some kind of suit that Adrian has built.
01:11:45.342,01:11:49.096,"And it has cameras, and it somehow… What?"
01:13:04.380,01:13:06.590,You can't do this. You can't do this!
01:13:06.673,01:13:08.092,He killed her!
01:13:08.175,01:13:11.011,"Please, I didn't do it! I didn't do it!"
01:13:11.095,01:13:14.014,No! No!
01:13:14.098,01:13:16.600,He killed her! He did it!
01:13:18.894,01:13:20.396,"Please, no! Please."
01:13:24.108,01:13:25.192,Listen to me!
01:13:25.275,01:13:27.027,No!
01:13:28.278,01:13:29.988,You motherfucker!
01:13:32.116,01:13:33.617,You killed her!
01:13:33.700,01:13:35.285,I see you!
01:13:35.869,01:13:37.329,I see you!
01:13:37.413,01:13:38.705,He's here!
01:13:38.789,01:13:40.541,"He's right here, he's right here!"
01:13:41.041,01:13:43.544,Please! You can't see him. He's in the room!
01:13:44.294,01:13:47.714,You have to listen to me! He's right there!
01:13:47.798,01:13:49.174,He's gonna hurt me.
01:13:51.718,01:14:58.952,He's… can you confirm the person in this video is you?
01:15:03.248,01:15:08.754,And can you confirm you recently fainted during a job interview due to a high amount of Diazepam in your system?
01:15:16.136,01:15:17.221,I was drugged.
01:15:20.682,01:15:25.521,"You also sent your sister an e-mail a few days ago saying you wished she was dead, didn't you?"
01:15:39.535,01:15:42.037,I have something that'll prove he's alive.
01:15:43.121,01:15:44.206,I found it.
01:15:45.749,01:15:46.750,What do you have?
01:15:57.594,01:16:01.181,I can't tell you right now.
01:16:02.391,01:16:03.642,He's listening.
01:16:06.937,01:16:08.522,"He's in the room, James."
01:16:09.523,01:16:14.861,"You're saying that the person who killed your sister is in the room right now, but we can't see him."
01:16:17.322,01:16:18.323,Okay.
01:16:19.074,01:16:20.075,Yeah.
01:16:32.004,01:16:33.338,Tell me you know that.
01:16:43.557,01:16:45.559,"I may as well have done it, though."
01:16:52.691,01:16:54.776,I brought Adrian into her life.
01:16:58.739,01:16:59.823,I did that.
01:17:02.075,01:17:04.411,I shouldn't have walked out on you and left you alone.
01:17:07.831,01:17:09.041,I failed you.
01:17:27.225,01:17:28.143,No.
01:17:37.569,01:17:38.570,No.
01:17:43.659,01:17:45.494,I wanted to talk to you about something.
01:17:47.579,01:17:51.208,We checked the blood test that you had done at the hospital last week.
01:17:51.291,01:17:53.293,Do you remember taking those blood tests?
01:17:54.336,01:17:55.295,Yes.
01:18:01.134,01:18:04.012,"Well, did you know that you were pregnant?"
01:18:26.952,01:18:27.953,No.
01:18:30.247,01:18:32.207,Didn't the doctor who took the test tell you?
01:18:34.501,01:18:38.422,"No, that can't be right. That's… That's not true."
01:18:41.883,01:18:46.888,"We can't be sure of exactly when, but it must've been some time in the last month."
01:18:52.561,01:18:56.064,"Sweetie, is there anyone we can call?"
01:19:02.028,01:19:03.196,Any friends?
01:19:05.532,01:19:06.533,Okay.
01:19:49.034,01:19:52.954,"Even though things ended badly for you and Adrian, I still look at you as family."
01:19:56.124,01:19:57.626,Are you my lawyer now?
01:19:58.752,01:20:00.921,I'm the lawyer for your source of income.
01:20:02.297,01:20:03.924,I represent my brother's trust.
01:20:05.842,01:20:16.186,"The money from his trust was payable to you conditional upon you being subject to criminal charges of any kind, or being ruled to be mentally incompetent."
01:20:16.812,01:20:24.611,"Now, in light of your current situation, it's my duty to inform you that any further payments are to be halted."
01:20:26.029,01:20:30.158,I know that you set up a bank account for a friend of yours to go to college.
01:20:30.242,01:20:34.287,"So, I take no pleasure in relaying that."
01:20:38.208,01:20:40.168,I used to feel sorry for you.
01:20:42.420,01:20:45.841,The blood relative of a narcissist sociopath.
01:20:47.592,01:20:49.177,Permanent punching bag.
01:20:50.929,01:20:52.597,Handcuffed to his wallet.
01:20:54.474,01:20:59.813,But now… I can see you for what you really are.
01:21:02.941,01:21:07.487,You're just the jellyfish version of him.
01:21:11.741,01:21:14.911,Everything but the spine.
01:21:18.248,01:21:19.791,You can try to litigate it.
01:21:21.293,01:21:23.295,But that's going to be an expensive option.
01:21:23.378,01:21:24.713,I can't see it working.
01:21:29.342,01:21:41.021,"However… if you sign this document and forfeit your share of the trust, it'll be a lot cleaner."
01:21:56.828,01:21:58.413,where this all goes away.
01:22:01.708,01:22:07.839,Agree to have the baby… and go back to him.
01:22:11.176,01:22:14.804,You really think he didn't know you were secretly using birth control?
01:22:15.931,01:22:17.015,Of course he did.
01:22:18.350,01:22:19.893,You should've known he'd find out.
01:22:19.976,01:22:21.603,You knew him as well as I did.
01:22:25.649,01:22:27.609,He replaced them with something else.
01:22:29.027,01:22:31.446,You only thought you were taking birth control pills.
01:22:34.199,01:22:37.410,"He was always going to find you, no matter what he had to do."
01:22:38.828,01:22:41.706,He needs you because you don't need him.
01:22:41.790,01:22:43.792,No one's ever left him before.
01:22:44.751,01:22:46.753,But he's punished you enough now.
01:22:47.545,01:22:50.215,Now that he knows you're the mother of his child.
01:22:51.508,01:22:53.301,It's time to stop playing games.
01:22:56.513,01:23:01.810,A new life with him can be given to you with one phone call.
01:23:03.770,01:23:06.231,A life just like your old one with Adrian.
01:23:06.940,01:23:09.943,"Cecilia, you don't really have a choice right now."
01:23:10.610,01:23:12.696,"Right now, you're a murderer."
01:23:15.323,01:23:16.574,But I can change that.
01:23:33.842,01:23:35.844,Adrian killed my sister.
01:23:36.553,01:23:38.138,And you helped him.
01:23:44.269,01:23:46.938,I don't expect you to make a decision right now.
01:23:51.693,01:23:53.194,I can come back in three days.
01:23:58.408,01:24:00.118,Be good to yourself until then.
01:24:00.869,01:24:02.078,We'll be watching.
01:24:10.378,01:24:12.130,"grab your rain boots, you're gonna need it."
01:24:12.213,01:24:13.882,You'll need them for a couple of days.
01:24:13.965,01:24:15.759,This pattern we're in stays put.
01:24:15.842,01:24:20.430,We've got this atmospheric river pointed right here at central California.
01:24:20.513,01:24:24.976,And that means cloudy and rainy as we get through the rest of the week.
01:24:25.060,01:24:27.020,This is a lot of moisture coming in.
01:24:27.103,01:24:32.025,It's going to mean heavy rainfall and flash-flooding concerns right as we get through the end of the week.
01:24:32.108,01:24:36.279,It's not until the weekend that we get our next chance of seeing some dry conditions.
01:24:36.362,01:24:42.202,"In fact, the next glimpse of sunshine doesn't come until Sunday afternoon, when temperatures hit the mid-60s."
01:24:42.285,01:25:10.230,"But until then, it's gonna be cool, it's gonna be damp… Tongue up."
01:25:11.356,01:25:12.357,Tongue down.
01:25:13.441,01:25:15.527,Okay. Good night.
01:26:30.393,01:26:31.853,You won't get the baby.
01:26:33.938,01:26:35.440,And you won't get me.
01:26:45.992,01:26:47.243,There you are.
01:26:54.459,01:26:56.002,Fuck you!
01:27:03.593,01:27:05.094,"Get back in bed, now."
01:27:36.334,01:27:37.585,Hey!
01:27:38.211,01:27:39.837,No!
01:27:39.921,01:27:42.048,"Please, no!"
01:27:43.091,01:27:44.926,No! Stop!
01:27:45.802,01:27:47.553,"No, please! No!"
01:27:48.304,01:27:50.890,"No, stop! No, stop!"
01:27:51.391,01:27:52.684,He's right there!
01:28:16.207,01:28:17.333,Lay down.
01:28:19.210,01:28:20.920,Lay down.
01:28:21.004,01:28:22.088,He's right behind you.
01:28:22.714,01:28:24.048,-Listen to me. -Who is?
01:28:24.132,01:28:25.675,He's right behind you.
01:28:26.759,01:28:28.094,"-I understand, Cecilia. -Turn around!"
01:28:28.177,01:28:29.595,-He's right there! -Lay down.
01:28:30.972,01:28:32.056,Listen to me!
01:28:32.557,01:28:34.058,-He's right behind you! -Stay down.
01:29:17.560,01:29:18.686,"No, no."
01:30:16.494,01:30:17.537,-Hey! -Get back!
01:30:17.620,01:30:18.955,"-Whoa, whoa. Okay. -Get back!"
01:31:20.975,01:31:22.018,You go left!
01:32:40.972,01:32:43.391,so I'm gonna truly teach you something.
01:32:43.474,01:32:45.768,"If you fight me, I won't ever hurt you."
01:32:45.851,01:32:48.396,I'll find someone you love and hurt them instead.
01:32:50.314,01:32:54.277,"Now, you've only got yourself to blame for that innocent young girl's death."
01:32:54.360,01:32:55.361,"No, please!"
01:32:55.444,01:32:57.321,"Not Sydney. Adrian, no."
01:32:58.197,01:32:59.991,Hold it! Show me your hands!
01:33:41.365,01:33:43.868,"Cecilia, don't do anything stupid."
01:33:46.370,01:33:47.538,I'm over here!
01:33:50.458,01:33:52.209,She's heading towards the main exit!
01:34:24.867,01:34:27.203,What the… What the fuck?
01:34:33.292,01:34:34.168,Hey!
01:34:34.251,01:34:37.046,"Harry, what's going on? Harry?"
01:34:37.129,01:34:38.255,Hey!
01:34:38.339,01:34:40.925,"Hello? Harry, are you okay?"
01:34:41.008,01:34:43.469,"-He's fine. He's fine, I promise. -What? Who is this?"
01:34:58.067,01:34:59.026,"James, it's me."
01:35:01.153,01:35:02.154,How are you calling me?
01:35:02.238,01:35:04.156,It doesn't matter about that. You have to listen to me.
01:35:04.240,01:35:05.449,"No, it does matter."
01:35:08.911,01:35:10.079,You can't be calling me.
01:35:10.162,01:35:13.416,"-James, listen to me! -Look… Sydney's life is in danger. Where are you right now?"
01:35:13.499,01:35:14.834,I'm at work. She's at the house.
01:35:16.502,01:35:18.421,"Okay. You need to go to her right now, James."
01:35:18.504,01:35:19.797,Do you hear me?
01:35:19.880,01:35:22.216,'Cause I'm afraid Adrian is gonna do something to her.
01:37:19.416,01:37:20.417,Sydney!
01:37:23.212,01:37:24.171,Sydney.
01:37:53.450,01:37:55.369,Stop!
01:38:00.708,01:38:02.042,Stop!
01:38:03.752,01:38:05.004,Stop!
01:38:09.967,01:38:11.218,Dad!
01:38:11.844,01:38:12.886,No!
01:39:16.867,01:39:17.910,Tom?
01:40:10.546,01:40:11.755,Help!
01:40:11.839,01:40:12.881,Help!
01:40:13.549,01:40:14.466,Please.
01:40:15.217,01:40:16.635,-Help! -Stand clear!
01:40:26.854,01:40:28.397,tied up in his basement.
01:40:29.690,01:40:32.568,"Looks like he was a victim of his brother, just like you were."
01:40:35.028,01:40:36.029,No.
01:40:37.948,01:40:40.451,"No, James. That's not right."
01:40:40.951,01:40:42.369,Adrian did this to me.
01:40:47.708,01:40:49.126,He is not the victim here.
01:40:51.462,01:40:53.630,He was tied up in his basement.
01:40:54.631,01:40:57.134,"If he faked his own death, he could fake his own kidnapping."
01:40:57.217,01:41:02.556,"We have Tom's body laying in my living room, wearing some sort of suit that you shot to pieces."
01:41:02.639,01:41:05.225,"If it did work, it doesn't now."
01:41:05.309,01:41:11.440,"But, but we have a whole bunch of corroborative witnesses from the psychiatric hospital when it comes to seeing something strange."
01:41:11.523,01:41:15.736,"Look, this is your best-case scenario for getting your freedom back, okay?"
01:41:16.528,01:41:17.529,No.
01:41:18.113,01:41:23.243,I… -I know Tom's body is in your living room. -Yeah.
01:41:25.412,01:41:27.498,Adrian did everything before that though.
01:41:31.001,01:41:32.336,He set his own brother up.
01:41:33.545,01:41:35.464,"I know how this works, Cee."
01:41:35.547,01:41:36.423,I know.
01:41:36.507,01:41:38.592,"-You don't understand. -No, you don't understand."
01:41:39.426,01:41:40.803,This is what he does.
01:41:42.262,01:41:44.598,He makes me feel like I'm the crazy one.
01:41:47.267,01:41:50.604,This is… This is what he does.
01:41:52.648,01:41:53.732,And he's doing it again.
01:41:53.816,01:41:55.317,"Okay, okay. But, listen."
01:41:55.400,01:42:01.281,I need you to keep that to yourself Okay?
01:42:01.865,01:42:03.534,Just let me help you.
01:42:03.617,01:42:06.370,"Yeah, but as long as Adrian's around, you can't help me."
01:42:58.964,01:43:00.966,I'm so glad you called.
01:43:42.925,01:43:44.009,You look amazing.
01:43:45.427,01:43:48.263,"I mean, you always… You always look amazing."
01:43:49.348,01:43:50.974,I don't feel amazing.
01:43:52.059,01:43:53.352,It's all a lie.
01:43:55.270,01:43:56.438,"Please, come on in."
01:43:57.230,01:43:58.357,It's cold. Come on.
01:44:22.839,01:44:28.178,"So, I wanted to get us some simple takeout, but, of course, I started obsessing over what you'd be in the mood for."
01:44:28.261,01:44:31.473,"Hence, we have the OCD buffet of sushi, steak, and pasta."
01:44:33.809,01:44:40.148,Or you might not be hungry at all. Uh… Which is so logical that it suddenly makes this feast look moronic.
01:44:55.372,01:44:56.999,My hand's shaking.
01:45:05.424,01:45:08.844,"You know, you're the only person in the world who gets to see my hand shake."
01:45:11.430,01:45:13.473,"It's 'cause I need you, Cecilia."
01:45:15.684,01:45:21.189,I know I didn't treat you the way you should have been treated when we were together.
01:45:22.190,01:45:24.818,But I've learned my lesson.
01:45:27.946,01:45:32.159,I would burn everything I own just to prove that to you.
01:45:36.955,01:45:37.956,Okay.
01:45:40.500,01:45:41.501,Okay.
01:45:44.421,01:45:53.388,"If you want to be a part of this child's life, it has to start with honesty."
01:45:54.514,01:45:55.515,Of course.
01:46:01.480,01:46:05.984,Which means I need you to admit everything that you did.
01:46:10.489,01:46:14.618,"That it was you, not your brother."
01:46:17.662,01:46:18.580,You.
01:46:27.130,01:46:28.340,I loved my brother.
01:46:29.299,01:46:30.550,"And I thought he loved me, too."
01:46:34.012,01:46:41.978,I know it didn't seem like it to the outside world… but Tom controlled me.
01:46:46.691,01:46:49.903,I need to know that I'm not crazy.
01:46:49.986,01:46:50.987,Okay?
01:46:55.909,01:46:58.495,And we can't start this with a lie.
01:46:58.578,01:47:00.747,But I'm not starting with a lie.
01:47:04.042,01:47:05.710,It wasn't me.
01:47:06.545,01:47:08.088,I swear it.
01:47:08.171,01:47:10.841,Why can't you just tell me the truth?
01:47:11.508,01:47:12.884,I am.
01:47:13.385,01:47:14.970,"Adrian, stop!"
01:47:19.015,01:47:22.310,I need you to do this for me.
01:47:35.365,01:47:39.202,I… am telling you the truth.
01:47:56.178,01:47:59.222,I know that you feel like you're going insane sometimes.
01:48:00.015,01:48:02.601,But I'm the only one who can help you.
01:48:03.101,01:48:04.311,Remember?
01:48:05.437,01:48:08.857,Because I know you better than anyone else in the world.
01:48:10.609,01:48:17.866,I mean… That shouldn't come as a… surprise.
01:48:38.762,01:48:39.804,Of course.
01:50:02.304,01:50:03.221,No!
01:50:11.187,01:50:16.443,"Please, you have to help me, please. I'm with somebody, and I think he's… he's tried to kill himself."
01:50:16.526,01:50:18.111,Hurry. You have to help.
01:50:25.577,01:50:30.874,"It's, uh, 3333 Celestial Drive."
01:50:33.335,01:50:34.336,Please.
01:50:54.314,01:50:55.398,Surprise.
01:51:23.718,01:51:27.305,Hey… -Are you okay? Are you okay? -It's okay. I'm okay.
01:51:27.389,01:51:29.224,"James, look at me. I'm okay."
01:51:31.017,01:51:32.227,He killed himself.
01:51:36.231,01:51:37.607,He cut his own throat.
01:51:38.483,01:51:40.318,There's security camera video of it.
01:51:53.289,01:51:56.876,"You never did want to get him admitting anything on tape, did you?"
01:51:57.961,01:51:58.920,"Of course, I did."
01:52:01.047,01:52:03.383,I just didn't know he was that unstable.
01:52:10.807,01:52:12.016,"You heard it, right?"
01:52:13.476,01:52:14.727,James?
01:52:18.356,01:52:19.983,What'd it sound like to you?
01:52:28.575,01:52:30.869,It sounded a lot like he killed himself.
