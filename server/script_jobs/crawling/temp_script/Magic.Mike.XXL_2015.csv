00:31:34.100,00:31:36.186,"YOU DIDN'T PICK IT, SO IT'S NOT ON THE INSIDE."
00:31:36.228,00:31:41.859,JUST BECAUSE YOU MADE UP SOME OF YOUR OWN ROUTINES BACK IN THE DAY DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU GET TO WALTZ BACK IN HERE AFTER THREE YEARS AND TRY TO TELL US HOW TO RUN OUR OWN SHIT.
00:31:41.900,00:31:43.736,I'M NOT TRYING TO TELL YOU WHAT THE FUCK TO DO.

00:32:31.116,00:32:35.036,"AND SHE WAS WITH HER BOYFRIEND, AND HE DID NOT LOOK LIKE HE WAS HITTING THAT SHIT RIGHT."
00:32:35.078,00:32:39.750,"SO THAT -- THAT SONG CAME ON, AND ALL I DID WAS JUST -- ALL I DID WAS JUST, LIKE, IMAGINE WHAT I WOULD DO TO HER."
00:32:39.792,00:32:41.710,THAT WAS IT.

01:45:08.301,01:45:10.554,"COME ON, LET'S NOT HATE."
01:45:10.596,01:45:13.599,"I KNOW WE WISH IT WAS US TONIGHT, BUT IT'S HER."
01:45:13.641,01:45:16.727,SHE'S THE LUCKY ONE.
