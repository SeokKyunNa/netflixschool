00:05:04.345,00:05:07.515,I have pineapples! I have strawberry!
00:05:13.938,00:05:14.856,Hey!
00:05:15.481,00:05:17.525,"We had a plan, Carter, and you done goofed it."
00:05:17.608,00:05:18.693,The plan's still on.
00:05:18.776,00:05:20.445,The plan was for you to get me B's.
00:05:20.528,00:05:24.532,-Does this look like a freaking B? -I just want what's best for you.
00:05:24.615,00:05:26.868,You know when the last time I got an A was?
00:05:26.951,00:05:29.037,"Okay, I'll act more stupid next time."
00:05:29.120,00:05:32.290,Completely moronic and idiotic. Beyond obtuse.
00:05:33.291,00:05:35.376,Yeah. Totally.
00:05:35.460,00:05:37.545,That's what I'm talking about.
00:05:39.589,00:05:43.593,"You making fun of me? You're dead this time, Carter."
00:06:20.671,00:06:24.592,"Go on. Go on, dog. I'll turn you into a hot dog. Now, go on."
00:08:05.151,00:08:09.405,I have pineapples! I have strawberries!
00:08:09.989,00:08:11.115,Thank you very much.
00:08:11.199,00:08:13.618,Have a nice day. Be careful with the cars.
00:08:13.701,00:08:15.453,"-You, too. -Okay."
00:10:10.484,00:10:13.696,-You're late. Again. -Come on. I wanna go to Sam's.
00:10:13.779,00:10:15.781,I was practicing for my recital.
00:10:15.865,00:10:18.409,I'm gonna do five pirouettes all on my own.
00:10:18.492,00:10:21.996,"-It's called a solo. You know that, right? -That's cool, Frankie."
00:10:42.308,00:10:45.186,And I'm gonna wear my boots to do my pirouettes.
00:10:48.064,00:10:49.774,"Hey. You are coming, right?"
00:10:49.857,00:10:52.360,"-To my recital? -Yeah, sure."
00:10:53.110,00:10:57.657,"If you don't come and Mom has to work, nobody will be there."
00:11:01.243,00:11:02.286,You'll be great.
00:11:02.870,00:11:03.954,"I'll be there, Frankie."
00:11:04.664,00:11:06.123,I promise.
00:11:08.542,00:11:09.960,That is if I invite you.
00:11:10.044,00:11:12.630,The tickets are for very important people only.
00:11:12.713,00:11:15.508,"-Come on, let's get in the street car. -No, we can't!"
00:11:15.591,00:11:19.178,"-You're the one who wanted to go to Sam's. -Wait, Frankie."
00:11:19.845,00:11:22.848,-I wanna walk. -It'll be fine. Come on.
00:11:56.340,00:11:58.175,Why do you have strawberries?
00:11:58.259,00:11:59.593,What are you talking about?
00:11:59.677,00:12:02.304,I saw you have strawberries in your pocket in the car.
00:12:18.446,00:12:19.447,Not gonna happen.
00:12:23.200,00:12:26.036,"You know you need to punch Pig-Face in the face, right?"
00:12:26.120,00:12:28.789,-Frankie... I don't care. -He'll bully you your whole life.
00:12:46.307,00:12:48.893,-Maybe he's in a good mood today. -In your dreams.
00:13:00.654,00:13:06.744,"That brings the total to $34 and 18... No, 19 cents."
00:13:06.827,00:13:08.037,"Not bad, am I right?"
00:13:08.621,00:13:12.500,"-How much more do we have to go? -Oh, you don't even wanna know."
00:13:13.834,00:13:16.921,we've been coming here twice a week for a long time.
00:13:17.546,00:13:20.341,You can at least take the watch out of the For Sale case.
00:13:20.424,00:13:22.718,Please. He meant to say please.
00:13:22.801,00:13:24.970,"I take it out of the case, people can't see it."
00:13:25.054,00:13:27.223,"People can't see it, people can't buy it."
00:13:27.306,00:13:30.351,But we're gonna buy it. Eventually.
00:13:30.434,00:13:37.024,"Listen, I told both of you when we started this whole cockamamieness, that if somebody wants the watch, I'll let you know."
00:13:37.107,00:13:44.365,"-Give you a chance to buy it first. -Yeah, but we should have-- When I bought it from your mother, I paid her good money."
00:13:44.448,00:13:47.076,"This is a business. Barely, but it is."
00:13:47.159,00:13:52.248,"Mr. King, I promise you'll get money. We're at, like, $34 and 19 cents."
00:13:52.331,00:13:54.333,"-Baby, you see how old I am? -Old."
00:13:55.251,00:13:56.293,A hundred?
00:13:57.920,00:14:00.339,You're not really helping your case.
00:14:00.422,00:14:05.219,"The point is, at this rate, you guys will be bringing my money to the cemetery."
00:14:05.302,00:14:06.971,I don't like the cemetery.
00:14:11.016,00:14:14.979,"Listen, a guy came in, he liked the watch. I told him it ran slow."
00:14:15.062,00:14:16.480,It doesn't run slow.
00:14:16.564,00:14:20.067,"My father kept it in perfect condition, and you know that."
00:14:20.150,00:14:23.404,"The point is, pudding head, he's not wearing it, is he?"
00:14:24.905,00:14:26.115,Oh...
00:14:26.949,00:14:31.954,"Mr. King, of all the people I don't like in this world, I like you the best."
00:14:32.037,00:14:34.206,You and every other woman in my life.
00:14:34.790,00:14:36.876,"Now, you two, get out of here."
00:14:36.959,00:14:40.462,"-We're just gonna keep coming back. -Yeah, like a rash."
00:14:40.546,00:14:42.172,-See ya tomorrow. -Take care.
00:15:01.567,00:15:04.111,"Next time, it'll be less money that we have to add."
00:15:07.031,00:15:10.284,You've been giving Mr. King your lunch money. I know you have.
00:15:13.996,00:15:17.291,Lots of things aren't very good in life. Get used to it.
00:15:17.374,00:15:21.337,You get used to being grounded forever or longer when Mom finds out.
00:16:07.800,00:16:09.385,Mom doesn't like it when you double dip.
00:16:09.468,00:16:13.722,"Mom's not here, so if you just shut your mouth for once, you'll be fine."
00:16:13.806,00:16:20.854,Fine. I can keep my mouth shut so much that I'll never talk to you for all the time in all the universes in all the world.
00:16:26.026,00:16:27.027,Carter...
00:16:27.111,00:16:29.196,Carter can't come to the phone right now.
00:16:29.279,00:16:32.866,Please don't leave a message after the beep. Beep!
00:16:32.950,00:16:34.410,Just look!
00:16:34.493,00:16:37.788,"If you are satisfied with your message, please press 1 or hang up."
00:16:37.871,00:16:39.623,"Carter, just listen to me!"
00:16:39.707,00:16:41.125,What?
00:16:43.419,00:16:44.545,No way.
00:16:48.048,00:16:50.968,I can't believe it. How did you even get up here?
00:16:55.014,00:16:58.183,-I knew you were doing something not good. -Come on. Good boy.
00:16:58.267,00:16:59.935,Come here. Good boy.
00:17:00.019,00:17:02.521,"-What's your name, bud? -He's a stray."
00:17:04.023,00:17:05.441,Where did you come from?
00:17:06.358,00:17:07.443,A trash can?
00:17:07.526,00:17:09.695,He smells worse than your side of the room.
00:17:12.406,00:17:14.616,You're right. Let's fix it.
00:17:56.575,00:17:59.286,"Carter, what are we gonna do about Mom?"
00:17:59.369,00:18:00.454,What about her?
00:18:01.246,00:18:02.581,She's gonna freak out.
00:18:02.664,00:18:05.793,"You asked for a bulldog for Christmas, and you got a stuffed animal."
00:18:05.876,00:18:10.798,Which is why we're not gonna tell her. He's just gonna stay in our room for now.
00:18:10.881,00:18:12.382,Where's he gonna pee and poo?
00:18:13.092,00:18:14.093,In your bed?
00:18:14.176,00:18:15.177,Carter!
00:18:15.260,00:18:17.096,Just until I can convince her.
00:18:17.805,00:18:22.226,"It's Mom. We'll never convince her. Like, ever."
00:18:24.728,00:18:25.896,"-Oh, crap. -Oh, no."
00:18:25.979,00:18:27.064,"Hey, hey!"
00:18:27.606,00:18:30.651,Where are my two favorite people that help Mom out?
00:18:34.196,00:18:37.199,You're the best mommy of all the mommies in all the world!
00:18:39.201,00:18:40.285,Aw...
00:18:40.369,00:18:41.370,What'd you break?
00:18:48.836,00:18:51.630,I was driving the ambulance 80 miles per hour.
00:18:56.552,00:18:59.680,"Here you go, Madame. Mushrooms on top."
00:18:59.763,00:19:02.891,"How about you, Mr. Man. Anything exciting happen at school today?"
00:19:02.975,00:19:04.309,Pig-Face happened.
00:19:04.393,00:19:05.853,Your death is about to happen.
00:19:10.899,00:19:13.527,Don't blow this up like you blow everything up.
00:19:13.610,00:19:14.987,I'm not blowing anything up.
00:19:15.070,00:19:16.321,I wanna know who this kid is.
00:19:16.405,00:19:17.865,"I told you, Pig-Face."
00:19:17.948,00:19:23.579,"-Can you butt out, Frankie? -Carter, what happened? Tell me the truth."
00:19:26.206,00:19:28.667,"-Carter, just-- -You don't wanna know the truth."
00:19:32.004,00:19:33.755,-Are you scared of this kid? -No.
00:19:35.549,00:19:36.466,-Go. -...to be ashamed of.
00:19:38.802,00:19:41.180,Here you go. No mushrooms.
00:19:41.263,00:19:43.140,"Um, actually, can I have mushrooms, please?"
00:19:43.223,00:19:46.852,-You hate mushrooms. -But taste buds change every seven years.
00:19:46.935,00:19:50.230,"-That's a scientific fact. -He's right. Very, very right."
00:19:54.860,00:19:55.861,Okay.
00:19:56.403,00:19:58.238,"I'm just worried about you, Carter."
00:19:58.322,00:20:01.450,-You're worried about everything. -That is not true.
00:20:01.992,00:20:06.205,"Okay, maybe that is a little bit true. A little bit."
00:20:08.790,00:20:10.626,"Anyway, here you go."
00:20:13.378,00:20:15.422,What is going on with you guys?
00:20:15.505,00:20:16.715,-Nothing. -Nothing.
00:20:16.798,00:20:19.092,I feel like you're hiding something from me.
00:20:19.760,00:20:23.639,"Okay. Mom, let's just calm down and eat our food."
00:20:28.810,00:20:38.904,"I know that things have been hard, and you guys wake up in the morning and I'm already at work, and you've been on your own a lot lately."
00:20:38.987,00:20:43.075,"But I just want you to know that you can talk to me, you know?"
00:20:58.006,00:20:59.383,"We do talk to you, Mom."
00:21:00.425,00:21:01.510,Don't worry.
00:21:02.803,00:21:05.806,"We love you, Mom, to the moon and back."
00:21:06.390,00:21:07.516,To the moon and back.
00:21:17.609,00:21:19.111,which in dog years is a lot.
00:21:19.194,00:21:23.407,My dad showed it to me on an electron telescope at the planetarium he ran.
00:21:23.490,00:21:25.367,Wanna know something more interesting?
00:21:25.450,00:21:28.203,This is my favorite ballerina book. Isn't she pretty?
00:21:31.290,00:21:33.208,And this is the Nutcracker.
00:21:33.292,00:21:35.502,It's about an evil rat king.
00:21:38.672,00:21:39.965,Mom will hear you.
00:21:40.048,00:21:42.926,"Hey, what if we named him Michael Jordan?"
00:21:43.010,00:21:45.554,That's the dumbest name for a dog I've ever heard.
00:21:45.637,00:21:48.515,Okay. What about Copernicus?
00:21:48.598,00:21:51.351,What is going on in your mind? No.
00:21:52.102,00:21:56.732,"This is my favorite, Sleeping Beauty. There's a lot of kissing."
00:21:59.109,00:22:01.111,He thought they were more reliable than people.
00:22:01.194,00:22:02.863,That's not very interesting.
00:22:03.530,00:22:07.326,"Yeah, but what about Benjamin, as his name?"
00:22:07.409,00:22:09.703,Mmm... What about Benji?
00:22:12.122,00:22:16.126,He does look kind of like a Benji. He's old and new at the same time.
00:22:19.087,00:22:21.089,Good boy. Good boy.
00:22:39.483,00:22:40.484,Carter...
00:22:42.694,00:22:44.780,I don't wanna say goodbye to Benji.
00:22:47.616,00:22:49.951,I don't like goodbye.
00:22:50.952,00:22:53.121,Promise me we won't have to.
00:23:00.462,00:23:03.715,"Hey, I promise you, Fritter."
00:23:15.268,00:23:17.687,I pray the Lord for this dog to keep.
00:23:17.771,00:23:20.649,And that I will do incredible at my recital.
00:23:20.732,00:23:25.153,And that my spelling teacher will quit her job forever and never come back.
00:23:25.237,00:23:29.699,And that Mommy will not have to worry so much.
00:23:30.617,00:23:34.204,And that I'll never have to eat any more mushrooms as long as I live.
00:23:34.746,00:23:35.747,Amen.
00:23:37.415,00:23:39.417,"Good night, Benji."
00:24:01.314,00:24:05.360,"They're getting so big, and they're so smart, and they catch on to things and..."
00:24:06.945,00:24:10.115,And I'm trying to keep everything together.
00:24:12.033,00:24:14.244,It's like I'm nothing but a nag.
00:24:14.327,00:24:18.623,"All of a sudden, I'm so serious."
00:24:21.168,00:24:27.591,Every day I feel like I'm messing them up and letting them down.
00:24:29.176,00:24:33.054,I don't know how to be in three places at once.
00:24:35.599,00:24:42.689,"So, feel free to give me some advice or one of your lame science jokes, or..."
00:24:45.192,00:24:47.527,a carton of ice cream and bingeing...
00:26:00.517,00:26:02.602,"-Carter? -Good morning, Mom."
00:26:02.686,00:26:03.895,What is that?
00:26:11.736,00:26:14.197,This is why you guys were being weird last night.
00:26:14.281,00:26:16.533,"He's cute. Mom, look at him."
00:26:19.286,00:26:21.246,"because he's almost a teenager, but you?"
00:26:21.329,00:26:24.457,"Mom, we're not lying. We just didn't tell you yet."
00:26:24.541,00:26:26.042,Where did he come from?
00:26:26.126,00:26:27.877,"Uh, he kind of found me."
00:26:27.961,00:26:30.088,"On the street, we saved him."
00:26:33.008,00:26:34.926,No. Okay.
00:26:36.720,00:26:44.394,"You're cute, but you are a dog and you poop everywhere, and you mess everything up, you chew on things, you keep us up at night."
00:26:44.477,00:26:45.895,"He loves you, Mommy."
00:26:45.979,00:26:49.065,No. Okay? I can barely keep the three of us afloat.
00:26:49.149,00:26:50.358,It's not happening.
00:26:50.442,00:26:54.029,"Mom, you don't have to worry. We'll take care of him."
00:26:54.612,00:26:56.823,I don't have the money or the time.
00:26:56.906,00:26:59.784,It's not happening. I'm taking him to a shelter.
00:26:59.868,00:27:03.288,They murder-kill dogs there. You can't take him there.
00:27:04.789,00:27:06.875,A shelter?
00:27:06.958,00:27:09.461,They won't even give him three days.
00:27:09.544,00:27:11.921,I won't let them hurt him.
00:27:14.257,00:27:16.926,"He's a good boy, and you won't even give him a chance."
00:27:17.010,00:27:19.804,"Carter, no, okay?"
00:27:19.888,00:27:21.431,I'm sorry... I don't...
00:27:21.514,00:27:23.808,I can't take care of one more thing right now.
00:27:23.892,00:27:26.269,He's not a thing. He's Benji.
00:27:27.145,00:27:28.521,You named him?
00:27:32.150,00:27:37.280,"I'm so sorry that you can't handle one more thing right now, but what about us?"
00:27:37.364,00:27:40.950,"We take care of each other, so I'm pretty sure that we can handle a dog."
00:27:41.034,00:27:44.788,Maybe he'll make things fun around here for once.
00:27:44.871,00:27:47.707,"Oh, I forgot. That's not allowed, either."
00:27:47.791,00:27:49.626,"Carter, no... That's not fair."
00:27:54.506,00:27:56.674,I don't even like that stupid dog.
00:28:16.569,00:28:17.904,Carter...
00:28:46.433,00:28:48.017,Mom won't let you stay.
00:28:50.895,00:28:52.605,You'll wind up in a pound.
00:28:54.607,00:28:55.608,Just go.
00:28:57.193,00:28:58.611,"Go, please."
00:29:10.290,00:29:11.666,"I love you, Benji."
00:32:03.463,00:32:06.132,-Then how come you got more money for Sam? -I don't.
00:32:06.215,00:32:07.926,Then how come we're going to Sam's?
00:32:08.009,00:32:09.427,To get my money back.
00:32:09.510,00:32:12.388,"If you get our money back, how do we get Dad's watch back?"
00:32:12.472,00:32:15.308,Mom doesn't care. She wouldn't let us keep Benji.
00:32:15.391,00:32:18.019,Why should I care about getting her the watch back?
00:32:18.102,00:32:20.480,Because we're a family.
00:32:22.315,00:32:25.068,You're just scared of somebody else buying it.
00:32:25.151,00:32:28.321,"I'm not scared. I'm realistic, Frankie."
00:32:28.404,00:32:30.448,I told you she wouldn't let us keep him.
00:32:30.531,00:32:33.701,You're not real or listic or whatever. You're just chicken.
00:32:33.785,00:32:37.080,You give up at everything when not very good things happen.
00:32:38.748,00:32:41.125,"-Mr. King, we need to talk. -...hold up."
00:32:41.209,00:32:44.087,"Hey, you kids, I sold the watch."
00:32:44.170,00:32:45.838,You two go on back home now.
00:32:45.922,00:32:48.466,-You what? -Sold the watch.
00:32:48.549,00:32:50.802,You sold the watch? That's not right.
00:32:50.885,00:32:53.304,-Y'all go on now. Go home. -You know what?
00:32:53.388,00:32:56.557,I'm gonna call the police and tell them you are a lying liar.
00:32:56.641,00:32:58.393,You can't sell the watch.
00:33:01.938,00:33:04.357,"Now, I remember being a kid."
00:33:04.440,00:33:10.154,"I used to tell my brother there I was gonna beat him with a baseball bat, but I didn't really mean it."
00:33:10.238,00:33:15.827,"When you say you're gonna go get the police, that's just you being a kid, right?"
00:33:18.955,00:33:22.750,"Good, but just in case, y'all are gonna stick around for a while."
00:33:31.134,00:33:39.017,"-Not until you let them kids go. -Mr. Pawn Man, put yourself in the shoes of two fellas who would come in here wearing these ridiculous masks. Do I look like I'm playing?"
00:33:40.059,00:33:41.728,Open the safe! Hurry up.
00:33:41.811,00:33:42.854,Y'all calm down.
00:33:42.937,00:33:45.523,"-Open up the safe, now! -Don't hurt them kids."
00:33:45.606,00:33:49.694,"Do it, before I hop that counter and slap the taste out your mouth. Come on, hurry up!"
00:33:50.611,00:33:52.196,Speed it up. Come on!
00:33:55.241,00:33:57.577,You got what you came for. Now go on.
00:33:57.660,00:33:58.703,Tie him up. Let's go.
00:33:58.786,00:34:00.204,"Move. Come on, back door."
00:34:02.040,00:34:05.710,-Where you taking them kids? -Move! The backdoor. Go. Get out.
00:34:06.294,00:34:07.795,Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.
00:34:18.639,00:34:22.727,"Y'all gonna sit here, stay quiet for ten minutes, and then forget any of this ever happened."
00:34:23.478,00:34:27.482,"If you don't, me and my brother will pay a little visit to your home. Understand?"
00:34:43.748,00:34:45.166,Get up. Get up.
00:35:02.266,00:35:04.560,"Now they've seen your face, too. Get in the van."
00:35:04.644,00:35:05.686,Please let us go.
00:35:05.770,00:35:07.688,-We didn't do anything. -Go on. Get in the van.
00:35:07.772,00:35:08.815,Please.
00:35:10.733,00:35:12.902,Help! Help!
00:35:53.651,00:35:54.902,Frankie.
00:35:58.072,00:35:59.073,Damn.
00:35:59.699,00:36:01.242,Is that your dog?
00:36:04.704,00:36:05.580,Get out the way!
00:36:05.663,00:36:08.916,"-You get this is kidnapping, right? -It's more like saving our butts."
00:36:14.255,00:36:15.882,-Mommy! -Get rid of it.
00:37:13.606,00:37:14.649,He's gone.
00:38:22.967,00:38:24.302,Why are you so ugly?
00:38:24.385,00:38:26.012,Wanna say that again?
00:38:29.098,00:38:30.850,Hey! What are you doing back there?
00:38:30.933,00:38:32.435,Nothing. It's just my lunch.
00:38:36.022,00:38:39.650,Don't you never call me ugly. Never!
00:38:45.573,00:38:46.824,Whoa!
00:38:59.253,00:39:01.547,Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
00:39:02.131,00:39:03.257,Tie 'em up in that back room.
00:39:09.680,00:39:10.681,Hey.
00:39:25.780,00:39:27.281,Give me your hands.
00:39:28.074,00:39:29.075,Please.
00:39:36.374,00:39:39.168,"I'm almost done with my shift, and I haven't heard from you guys."
00:39:39.251,00:39:43.214,"I know that you're mad at me, but you have to tell me where you are."
00:39:46.759,00:39:47.885,"Look, I'm sorry."
00:39:48.719,00:39:49.804,And I love you.
00:39:50.388,00:39:52.807,"So call me, okay?"
00:40:00.231,00:40:03.317,What'd you pick this place for? Gives me the creeps.
00:40:03.401,00:40:05.611,So nobody comes sniffing around.
00:40:07.530,00:40:09.698,"-What're you doing, man? -Checking our score."
00:40:10.324,00:40:13.786,I mean with them. I didn't sign up for no kidnapping.
00:40:13.869,00:40:15.538,Let me make something real clear to you.
00:40:15.621,00:40:18.624,"There are people that want money from us, but we ain't got no money, do we?"
00:40:19.250,00:40:22.461,So they gonna break every bone in our body instead.
00:40:23.045,00:40:24.463,That what you signed up for?
00:40:25.673,00:40:28.926,I don't owe those people nothing. That's all you.
00:40:31.429,00:40:33.764,"Who took care of you seven years, huh?"
00:40:34.348,00:40:36.559,"Food, clothes, all that?"
00:40:36.642,00:40:40.980,I was the one who figured out a way for us to keep on even when our own parents wouldn't.
00:40:42.815,00:40:44.650,"What I owe, you owe."
00:40:52.491,00:40:56.787,"-All right. So what's the plan? -Sell all this, pay off our debt."
00:40:58.289,00:41:01.208,Keep them around in case we need a get-out-of-jail-free card.
00:41:03.377,00:41:04.628,And then what?
00:41:07.131,00:41:08.966,And then we no longer need 'em.
00:42:15.950,00:42:17.159,She's cold.
00:42:21.664,00:42:25.084,-So what? -I like this here watch.
00:42:26.252,00:42:27.253,A lot.
00:42:27.836,00:42:29.838,It actually reminds me of a watch my daddy had.
00:42:29.922,00:42:31.423,Give it back!
00:42:33.884,00:42:36.929,Was this the reason y'all was in the shop today?
00:42:40.057,00:42:41.100,To the man of my dreams.
00:42:42.101,00:42:44.812,I love you more than the moon and the stars.
00:42:45.521,00:42:48.232,"Love, W. That's nice."
00:42:49.733,00:42:51.527,Let me work this here.
00:42:51.610,00:42:55.573,"Your daddy run off. Got sick and tired of you, your old mama."
00:42:56.365,00:42:58.075,So she sold it. It's good riddance.
00:42:59.410,00:43:03.789,"But then, y'all want a little something something to remember him by."
00:43:04.999,00:43:06.709,"Ain't that right, little man?"
00:43:11.088,00:43:12.756,Tell me how bad you want it.
00:43:15.759,00:43:18.470,Come on. Tell me.
00:43:19.305,00:43:20.556,"It's yours, ain't it?"
00:43:23.100,00:43:24.518,You can take it from me.
00:43:30.190,00:43:32.818,Take it. Take it.
00:43:34.820,00:43:35.821,Yeah.
00:43:36.947,00:43:38.198,What you scared of?
00:43:41.201,00:43:42.870,"You're a little coward, huh?"
00:43:46.415,00:43:47.958,Just like your old man.
00:44:45.265,00:44:47.017,"Sic, Rott! Sic him!"
00:44:51.563,00:44:53.899,Go. Go!
00:45:10.874,00:45:11.875,Hey!
00:45:27.266,00:45:28.934,"Dumb move, dog."
00:45:32.521,00:45:33.730,Where are you?
00:45:39.278,00:45:40.112,Hey!
00:45:41.071,00:45:42.156,Help!
00:45:51.498,00:45:53.000,Day keeps getting better.
00:46:16.398,00:46:17.649,Little doggie.
00:46:19.526,00:46:21.069,"Where you at, baby boy?"
00:46:21.153,00:46:23.113,Come out and play.
00:46:30.913,00:46:33.332,Little doggie.
00:46:36.418,00:46:38.170,Where are you?
00:46:48.680,00:46:50.057,I'm gonna skin you alive.
00:46:50.891,00:46:53.268,Gonna wipe that stupid grin off your face.
00:46:59.107,00:47:00.108,Where you at?
00:47:14.373,00:47:15.541,Benji!
00:47:15.624,00:47:18.460,"Come here, boy. Get this. Please, get this."
00:47:18.544,00:47:19.586,Good boy.
00:47:25.676,00:47:29.429,I hate that dog!
00:47:54.204,00:47:55.581,"Run, Benji, run!"
00:47:58.417,00:47:59.418,"Run, Benji!"
00:48:49.760,00:48:50.761,"Hey, who is that?"
00:48:53.847,00:48:55.599,What are you doing in here?
00:48:57.601,00:48:59.061,"Puppy, bark for me!"
00:49:01.229,00:49:03.482,"Where'd you go, puppy? Come on, puppy."
00:49:03.565,00:49:05.942,Where'd you go? I know you're out there.
00:49:08.278,00:49:10.197,What are you doing out there?
00:49:11.448,00:49:14.117,"Come on, puppy. Come on, puppy. Come on."
00:49:16.745,00:49:18.330,"Hey, puppy, come on back now."
00:49:24.044,00:49:24.920,What're you...
00:49:25.003,00:49:26.713,Are you trying to get the lock?
00:49:27.381,00:49:31.718,"Come on, puppy, you can do it! I know you can."
00:49:31.802,00:49:35.555,"Come on, pup. Don't leave me now. Don't give up, puppy."
00:49:35.639,00:49:40.686,"Come on, baby. I know you can do it. Come on, puppy. You almost got it. Get it."
00:49:40.769,00:49:43.939,"Come on, pup. Come on, I know you can do it."
00:49:45.273,00:49:48.485,"Puppy, thank you! You opened the door!"
00:49:48.568,00:49:50.904,"Yes, yes, hey. Good boy."
00:49:50.987,00:49:53.281,Wait. Where's Carter and Frankie?
00:49:59.579,00:50:01.665,Sam King? Sam King?
00:50:02.332,00:50:03.834,Detective Lyle Burton. How you doing?
00:50:03.917,00:50:07.963,"-Hey. Listen. You got to find the kids. -Trust me, we're gonna find them."
00:50:08.046,00:50:09.047,Did you see what the guys look like?
00:50:09.131,00:50:11.883,"-No, they were wearing-- -I got something."
00:50:11.967,00:50:15.011,"Okay. Hold on for a second, okay? What you got? What you got?"
00:50:15.554,00:50:17.472,I found it out back.
00:50:26.690,00:50:29.151,"-What happened? -Ms. Hughes, I'm Detective Lyle Burton."
00:50:29.234,00:50:32.320,-We're gonna do everything we can-- -Why were they even here?
00:50:32.404,00:50:34.072,-It's the watch. -The watch?
00:50:34.156,00:50:35.490,Your husband's watch.
00:50:35.574,00:50:39.536,The kids have been coming in every day almost trying to buy it back.
00:50:42.956,00:50:47.335,I told them that I sold it. I didn't know that they'd come in here to...
00:51:20.744,00:51:22.954,-Hey! What... -Get him. What...
00:51:23.997,00:51:26.333,-What is he doing here? -That dog saved me.
00:51:26.416,00:51:28.543,-Is he yours? -No. What... He what?
00:51:28.627,00:51:31.588,He got me out of the dang closet they locked me in.
00:51:52.734,00:51:54.236,Ms. Hughes! Ms. Hughes!
00:51:55.362,00:51:58.740,Stay put. Requesting backup. I got a 2-12 on foot.
00:52:00.826,00:52:05.247,"Uh, brown hair, 35 pounds, four legs."
00:52:05.330,00:52:06.873,"You wanna repeat that, Burton?"
00:52:06.957,00:52:08.124,Not especially.
00:52:17.843,00:52:19.302,I'm following that dog.
00:52:21.054,00:52:24.307,-We will follow the dog. Just come on. -Fine. Let's go.
00:52:27.686,00:52:29.396,About to catch a heart attack.
00:52:29.479,00:52:31.231,Get in the car. Let's go!
00:52:57.674,00:53:00.927,"Hey, hey. No, no, no, you wait. Wait here. I got it."
00:53:05.223,00:53:07.142,Must be out of my doggoned mind.
00:53:25.702,00:53:27.412,The heck you sniffing around for?
00:53:36.671,00:53:37.672,What you got?
00:53:41.176,00:53:42.344,What? What is that?
00:53:46.514,00:53:49.142,Pudding? Does it look like I want pudding?
00:53:53.146,00:53:54.689,Is that why you brought us here?
00:54:00.070,00:54:02.739,And then you walk off. Great.
00:54:31.893,00:54:33.520,Stop. Just stop.
00:54:41.820,00:54:43.780,"No, stop. Just stop!"
00:54:43.863,00:54:46.908,Do you have any idea how much time I've wasted?
00:54:52.956,00:54:55.166,I don't wanna see you ever again. Go.
00:55:03.675,00:55:05.719,Do you hear me? Go!
00:56:06.529,00:56:10.200,"What the heck were you thinking, Street? We got procedure, son."
00:56:10.283,00:56:11.743,"Sir, I know. I got carried away."
00:56:11.826,00:56:17.373,Ms. Hughes? Here's a cup of jasmine tea. It manifests good fortune.
00:56:18.541,00:56:20.168,-Thank you. -You're welcome.
00:56:24.672,00:56:26.674,How much money had they saved up?
00:56:26.758,00:56:29.594,It doesn't matter. I should've given them the watch back.
00:56:29.677,00:56:31.596,"No, I never should have sold it."
00:56:33.348,00:56:39.521,I should've done something so they didn't think that buying a watch would make it all okay.
00:56:40.396,00:56:42.398,"The honest truth is, Ms. Hughes..."
00:56:43.399,00:56:46.778,"I didn't give the watch back, 'cause I like having 'em come in."
00:56:48.404,00:56:51.574,"Those two, they got nothing but love in 'em."
00:56:58.331,00:57:00.583,-I got something. -It's Carter's.
00:57:00.667,00:57:02.043,A traffic cop found it.
00:57:02.877,00:57:06.422,"No usable prints, but it's a starting point, location-wise."
00:57:16.182,00:57:18.435,"Hey, come on. Give me my phone back."
00:57:19.686,00:57:24.941,Don't eat the rubber ducky. Give me that back. Good boy. Good boy.
00:57:31.823,00:57:35.702,"Hey, where did you come from, buddy? Do you need a home?"
00:57:49.174,00:57:50.800,Mom will never let us keep him.
00:57:57.056,00:58:00.894,"when Dad got sick, Mom did, too."
01:03:37.939,01:03:39.982,-We'll get out of here. -I don't wanna go anymore.
01:03:40.066,01:03:41.567,Look at my face. See how much I care?
01:03:41.651,01:03:44.445,"Go on. Come on, Titus. Let's go."
01:03:45.154,01:03:48.241,"Uh... What are we doing, man?"
01:03:48.825,01:03:50.660,"Listen. I know a guy, all right?"
01:03:50.743,01:03:53.204,He's gonna buy our score and take us up river.
01:03:55.248,01:03:57.291,They're coming with us. Come on.
01:03:58.084,01:03:59.293,What are you saying?
01:04:01.295,01:04:03.381,Don't worry your pretty little head about it.
01:04:05.091,01:04:07.009,What y'all doing over there?
01:04:07.093,01:04:08.219,-Nothing. -Nothing.
01:04:08.302,01:04:09.512,Nothing.
01:04:12.932,01:04:14.767,"No, please. No."
01:04:16.769,01:04:18.896,"-No, please, please. -Please. Please."
01:04:20.690,01:04:22.066,Let me be real clear...
01:04:22.859,01:04:27.488,I don't need but one of y'all to be my insurance policy. You hear me?
01:04:34.453,01:04:36.664,Get goin'. Go on.
01:04:37.999,01:04:39.000,Titus!
01:04:41.627,01:04:44.005,-Ms. Hughes... -I have to go find my kids.
01:04:44.088,01:04:47.884,-Just give me a second. -I can't just sit here any longer.
01:04:47.967,01:04:50.303,-I have to go. -You have to be rational.
01:04:50.386,01:04:52.805,Ms. Hughes! I have a lead.
01:04:55.766,01:04:56.767,What?
01:04:57.351,01:04:59.687,This van. It was stolen two days ago.
01:04:59.770,01:05:01.731,-And you think that they're in there? -Yeah.
01:05:01.814,01:05:04.108,It raced out of the quarter down towards the river.
01:05:04.942,01:05:06.819,That's right where the dog was taking us.
01:05:06.903,01:05:09.113,-It's just a coincidence. -How is that a coincidence?
01:05:09.196,01:05:12.742,"-Listen, the house was empty. -Maybe you didn't look hard enough."
01:05:12.825,01:05:15.703,You're talking as if you think a dog is smarter than the police.
01:05:15.786,01:05:17.204,I'm going back to the house.
01:05:17.288,01:05:19.248,We need to follow protocol this time!
01:05:19.332,01:05:20.666,Detective...
01:05:21.918,01:05:25.129,I don't think that dog was following any kind of protocol.
01:05:25.796,01:05:27.882,I think he was following his heart.
01:05:34.847,01:05:38.517,"If anybody ask, I'm following the lead, all right?"
01:05:38.601,01:05:43.147,Don't you worry. I'm real good at not telling the police things.
01:06:03.000,01:06:04.043,"Boat's coming in, Syd."
01:06:14.971,01:06:16.138,There's our ride.
01:06:22.311,01:06:23.312,Stay.
01:06:31.070,01:06:38.202,"Carter, I always pretend like I'm not scared, but I'm really scared."
01:06:40.663,01:06:42.206,I'm really scared.
01:06:48.629,01:06:50.172,"Please, God."
01:06:51.632,01:06:53.718,Please help us get back home.
01:06:55.386,01:06:59.974,"Please, please, please."
01:07:01.892,01:07:03.019,Please.
01:08:25.101,01:08:26.519,This wasn't open before.
01:08:28.521,01:08:29.605,Are you sure?
01:08:32.858,01:08:33.859,I'm sure.
01:09:08.561,01:09:14.191,"It's an underground transport tunnel, built way back for things you don't even wanna know about."
01:09:14.275,01:09:17.403,-You think they went... Carter! Frankie! -What you doing?
01:09:17.486,01:09:20.990,-Those are my kids! -Relax. Listen. We can cut 'em off.
01:09:21.073,01:09:23.993,-There's a river. I'll make a call. Okay? -Okay.
01:09:24.076,01:09:26.370,-Wait! Give me your keys. -Huh?
01:09:26.453,01:09:28.914,-I drive an ambulance for a living. -No.
01:09:31.000,01:09:32.126,No!
01:09:35.087,01:09:36.922,You call this driving?
01:09:37.006,01:09:37.882,Not yet.
01:12:13.120,01:12:14.580,You're not your brother.
01:12:21.795,01:12:23.839,My brother thinks I'm stupid.
01:12:28.218,01:12:30.012,He thinks he's the boss of me.
01:12:34.892,01:12:38.187,-But I can make decisions for myself. -Yeah.
01:12:42.691,01:12:45.277,That's why I'm taking this here cash...
01:12:47.237,01:12:48.447,all for me...
01:12:51.033,01:12:52.034,and bailin'...
01:12:54.286,01:12:57.790,so I don't never have to listen to another thing he says...
01:12:58.415,01:12:59.958,never again.
01:13:04.505,01:13:05.756,Who's ugly now?
01:13:10.803,01:13:14.056,"Hey, my man! Can you help us out? Have you seen these two kids?"
01:13:14.139,01:13:15.891,A van? Anything out of the ordinary?
01:13:18.769,01:13:20.604,"No, sir, I never seen 'em."
01:13:39.540,01:13:40.457,Benji.
01:13:40.541,01:13:42.918,-That her dog? -Yeah. Whether she knows it or not.
01:13:44.211,01:13:48.215,"Okay, I'm requesting backup. I'm at the boatyard, right off..."
01:13:50.676,01:13:51.677,Hey!
01:14:42.644,01:14:44.730,"Come on, I thought we was friends."
01:14:53.071,01:14:56.158,You got the right to pretty much nothing.
01:15:18.180,01:15:19.139,Benji!
01:15:59.263,01:16:01.265,You thought that dog was gonna save you?
01:16:01.348,01:16:02.891,You're not going anywhere.
01:16:03.600,01:16:06.436,"-Yeah, we are. -What are you gonna do, big man?"
01:16:08.438,01:16:09.815,About time.
01:16:12.234,01:16:14.861,"-Frankie, Carter! -Mommy!"
01:16:15.904,01:16:16.780,Benji.
01:16:19.491,01:16:22.661,Benji! Benji!
01:18:24.074,01:18:25.367,"I love you, Benji."
01:18:56.148,01:18:57.023,Benji?
01:19:04.322,01:19:05.323,Benji?
01:19:05.907,01:19:07.409,He didn't give up.
01:19:09.703,01:19:11.997,-I love you. -I don’t have to say goodbye.
01:19:32.851,01:19:33.852,Thank you.
01:19:36.813,01:19:38.857,This is going back where it belongs.
01:19:40.358,01:19:41.651,Watch your head.
01:19:50.035,01:19:51.036,Hello.
01:19:54.664,01:19:56.249,Did good today. Good boy.
01:19:58.919,01:19:59.961,What you doing?
01:20:04.216,01:20:07.135,You're a good girl. You're a very good girl.
01:20:42.420,01:20:43.713,and you can help me with ballet.
