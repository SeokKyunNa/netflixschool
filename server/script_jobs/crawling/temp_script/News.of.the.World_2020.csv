00:20:36.083,00:20:41.708,"It's me, daughter of Turning Water and Three Spotted!"
00:20:42.875,00:20:44.291,Come back!
00:33:31.333,00:33:32.875,Welcome.
00:33:32.958,00:33:34.375,I am friend.
00:33:35.250,00:33:37.000,You are Johanna?
00:33:38.666,00:33:42.000,My name is Cicada. I do not know Cho-hanna.
00:33:58.708,00:34:00.083,He's taking you home.
00:34:02.250,00:34:03.750,I have no home.
00:34:03.833,00:34:07.000,It was burned by soldiers when I was taken.
00:34:09.500,00:34:10.833,Your Kiowa family?
00:34:16.416,00:34:17.791,All dead.
00:35:07.833,00:35:10.416,He's taking you to another home.
00:53:46.041,00:53:49.375,Captain did a wondrous thing!
00:53:53.708,00:53:57.166,Three hands.
00:54:00.750,00:54:04.041,Three enemies dead.
00:54:12.916,00:54:16.833,His lightning brought us victory.
01:02:29.833,01:02:44.833,All the buffalo are dying… And we must choose… Make a stand or fall forever.
01:09:57.375,01:09:58.625,Horses.
01:14:17.291,01:14:18.291,Water.
01:17:52.041,01:17:53.916,They know we are here.
01:19:13.750,01:19:15.166,This way.
01:23:39.375,01:23:40.375,No.
01:23:41.833,01:23:49.333,To move forward… you must first remember.
01:26:44.458,01:26:45.583,Water.
01:34:04.500,01:34:07.458,"Wolf, he wouldn't listen."
01:35:38.000,01:35:39.166,What is that?
01:35:40.333,01:35:41.541,Books.
01:35:41.625,01:35:43.000,Stories.
01:35:44.625,01:35:48.333,There is no time for stories.
01:48:02.625,01:48:04.625,We did what we could.
01:48:27.583,01:48:32.166,You belong with me.
01:48:40.166,01:48:41.791,You belong with me.
00:02:23.916,00:02:26.583,"-Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. -Good evening."
00:02:27.541,00:02:30.041,It's good to be back with you all here in Wichita Falls.
00:02:30.125,00:02:36.083,"My name is Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd, and I'm here tonight to bring y'all the news from across this great world of ours."
00:02:39.166,00:02:40.166,Pleasure.
00:02:40.958,00:02:44.375,"Now, I know how life is in these parts, working a trade sunup to sundown."
00:02:44.458,00:02:46.791,No time for reading newspapers. Am I correct?
00:02:48.541,00:02:50.208,Let me do that work for you.
00:02:50.291,00:03:00.041,"And maybe, just for tonight, we can escape our troubles and hear of the great changes that are happening out there."
00:03:03.041,00:03:04.125,"Starting local, then."
00:03:04.708,00:03:10.875,"Our own Houston Telegraph from 1st February, this news."
00:03:12.125,00:03:20.333,The meningitis epidemic continues to spread without prejudice across the Panhandle and North Texas region.
00:03:20.416,00:04:04.750,"So far, it has claimed of the state of Texas up there in the capital… -There. -Much obliged."
00:05:53.416,00:05:54.625,Hey!
00:05:56.916,00:05:57.916,Hey!
00:06:00.833,00:06:02.208,Hey!
00:06:02.833,00:06:03.958,Stop!
00:06:06.666,00:06:08.083,I'm not gonna hurt you!
00:06:10.333,00:06:11.333,Come here!
00:06:29.791,00:06:30.958,Who are you?
00:06:35.083,00:06:36.250,Do you have a name?
00:06:57.666,00:06:59.250,I don't speak Kiowa.
00:07:00.250,00:07:01.250,Come.
00:07:03.958,00:07:04.958,Come on.
00:07:07.000,00:07:09.416,It's all right. It's all right.
00:07:11.208,00:07:12.208,Come on.
00:07:13.750,00:07:15.541,You can't stay out here.
00:07:16.333,00:07:17.541,Give me your hand.
00:07:45.333,00:07:47.541,Johanna Leonberger.
00:07:49.333,00:07:50.583,Is that your name?
00:08:20.416,00:08:21.833,Go check it on that side.
00:08:28.083,00:08:29.791,"Where'd you serve, Captain?"
00:08:29.875,00:08:34.791,"Third Texas Infantry. Surrendered Galveston, 26th May, 1865."
00:08:35.708,00:08:36.708,Any sidearms?
00:08:36.791,00:08:37.833,"No, sir."
00:08:39.458,00:08:41.041,Just bird shot.
00:08:41.833,00:08:45.208,Says here you're from San Antonio. What's your business up here?
00:08:45.291,00:08:47.458,I read the news from town to town.
00:08:48.750,00:08:51.791,I was headed down to the Red River and-- and I seen him.
00:08:53.083,00:08:57.333,I think he was transporting this little girl here for the federal authorities.
00:09:00.500,00:09:02.375,Looks like the Indians had her.
00:09:04.750,00:09:08.166,Here's her agency papers. Just found them.
00:09:23.916,00:09:27.083,-You're good. -What the hell do I do with this child?
00:09:27.166,00:09:29.500,Fetch her to Red River. Command post will know.
00:09:29.583,00:09:31.958,"-Hyah. -Hyah, hyah."
00:10:03.166,00:10:05.625,when they cleared the Kiowa out of Montague County.
00:10:07.125,00:10:13.208,"You've been living with them since they kidnapped you, when they attacked your family in Hill Country six years prior."
00:10:15.583,00:10:16.916,Dear Heaven.
00:10:20.958,00:10:30.875,"Her mother, father and sister were… Well, they passed. But you have an aunt and an uncle."
00:10:33.583,00:10:35.458,Still living down there.
00:10:36.458,00:10:37.791,Near Castroville.
00:10:40.583,00:10:42.625,So that's where you were being taken.
00:10:45.750,00:10:47.166,I know Castroville.
00:10:48.250,00:10:50.333,I used to live near there before the war.
00:10:58.583,00:11:00.375,Lot of German folk down there.
00:11:07.333,00:11:10.500,Kannst du Deutsch sprechen?
00:11:11.291,00:11:29.083,"Kann-- Kannst du deine Familie… Remember your German family? Uh… Come tomorrow, we will find somebody who can take you home."
00:12:24.083,00:12:25.250,Come on. Uh-uh.
00:12:29.083,00:12:31.375,Pardon me. Lost child here.
00:12:35.583,00:12:37.375,"Much obliged. Bless you, sir."
00:12:37.458,00:12:38.625,I got a lost child.
00:12:41.000,00:12:42.083,Thank you.
00:12:49.125,00:12:52.291,-What's your business? -Here to see your Indian agent.
00:12:53.375,00:12:55.041,He's up north of the Red.
00:12:55.125,00:12:56.750,On the reservation.
00:12:57.458,00:13:00.125,"Well, I found this child, see."
00:13:00.208,00:13:04.833,And the lieutenant who was patrolling the road told me to bring her to see you.
00:13:07.916,00:13:09.333,What do you expect me to do?
00:13:09.416,00:13:10.958,She needs taking home.
00:13:11.041,00:13:13.625,The agent won't be back for another three months.
00:13:13.708,00:13:15.916,Strays are his responsibility.
00:13:16.000,00:13:18.166,Looks like you'll need to take her.
00:13:18.250,00:13:19.791,"I can't take her, sir."
00:13:19.875,00:13:22.791,I work and travel from town to town.
00:13:22.875,00:13:24.500,I can't take her.
00:13:25.500,00:13:26.541,"Listen, friend."
00:13:27.166,00:13:30.083,Wait for the agent or take her yourself. It's up to you.
00:13:33.416,00:13:34.666,"If you will, please."
00:14:17.208,00:14:19.625,"Good to lay eyes on you, Captain."
00:14:19.708,00:14:21.166,"Hello, Simon."
00:14:22.041,00:14:24.958,Wonder if I could have a word with you and Mrs. Boudlin.
00:14:26.375,00:14:27.833,"Well, of course, sir."
00:14:34.250,00:14:36.166,"Wait for the agent, it appears."
00:14:49.750,00:14:52.166,"Got kind of a wild look about her, doesn't she?"
00:14:53.083,00:14:54.291,"No, she's scared."
00:14:57.875,00:14:59.291,"Be careful, honey."
00:15:00.458,00:15:01.875,Don't get too close.
00:15:07.166,00:15:08.541,"All right, now, see here, child."
00:15:08.625,00:15:12.750,I have to work. You're gonna stay here with these kind folks.
00:15:13.958,00:15:16.583,Friends. Friends.
00:15:17.416,00:15:19.125,"You got that, child?"
00:15:23.000,00:15:25.166,"She don't understand a damn thing, does she?"
00:15:28.000,00:15:29.250,Thank you kindly.
00:15:40.666,00:15:44.541,The Red River ferry is sunk near Cross Timbers.
00:15:49.416,00:15:53.041,…and parts down to Elm Creek are completely washed out.
00:15:54.625,00:15:59.208,"Yanks sending soldiers too blue to muddy their boots, that's why."
00:16:03.208,00:16:12.500,"Well, now The Clifton Record is reporting big changes that are coming to these parts that'll have a bearing on all of these travel issues."
00:16:12.583,00:16:29.208,"On page one, The Pacific Railroad Committee voted today that Missouri, Fort Scott and Gulf lines are to be consolidated into a new line that will run from the Kansas border all the way to Galveston, Texas."
00:16:33.833,00:16:38.083,This will be the first railroad to cross the Indian reservation.
00:16:45.833,00:16:48.875,"Now, for some federal news."
00:16:54.041,00:17:12.041,"President Ulysses S. Grant… has ordered the Texas legislature to accept Amendments 13, 14 and 15 of the United States Constitution before any return to the Union can be considered."
00:17:12.916,00:17:19.166,Those amendments include the abolition of slavery… Say no to abolition. Never!
00:17:22.208,00:17:24.625,and the repayment of our war debts.
00:17:26.541,00:17:27.916,I'm saying no.
00:17:28.000,00:17:32.708,I say Texas first and damn them amendments.
00:17:35.875,00:17:41.166,"I ain't digging no Texas soil, sweating and bleeding for some rich Yankee type."
00:17:42.125,00:17:43.833,I suggest y'all watch yourself.
00:17:43.916,00:17:45.541,Suggest y'all the same!
00:17:47.458,00:17:49.250,"What are y'all even doing here, huh?"
00:17:49.875,00:17:52.416,You ain't dealing with the Injuns. Fixing our roads.
00:17:52.500,00:17:54.083,Minding our river crossings.
00:17:54.166,00:17:56.791,All they're doing is beating up on Southern folk!
00:18:00.375,00:18:02.625,"Yeah, all right. I hear you. I hear you."
00:18:07.791,00:18:10.333,Northern blues are not helping us a lot.
00:18:10.416,00:18:12.750,And they're asking for a great deal in return.
00:18:16.875,00:18:18.250,We're all hurting.
00:18:19.708,00:18:21.041,All of us.
00:18:23.541,00:18:27.208,But I'm thinking we got a part to play in all of this as well.
00:18:29.875,00:18:36.333,There's more than rain and Indians and Northern blues troubling our roads.
00:18:36.416,00:18:39.458,"I've seen it myself, coming in from Wichita Falls."
00:18:40.125,00:18:41.166,Yeah.
00:18:42.958,00:18:44.125,We're all hurting.
00:18:47.000,00:18:48.541,These are difficult times.
00:18:55.041,00:18:57.041,"-Appreciate it, thank you. -Thanks."
00:18:57.125,00:18:58.333,-Much obliged. -Thank you.
00:18:58.416,00:19:00.666,-Thank you so much. -Thank you for your attention.
00:19:00.750,00:19:03.041,Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me.
00:19:06.083,00:19:07.333,She's gone.
00:19:09.125,00:19:11.041,Little one! Child!
00:19:14.291,00:19:17.750,"I-- I was singing her a hymn, and I turned my back and she was gone!"
00:19:17.833,00:19:20.250,She didn't take the horses. She can't be gone far.
00:19:25.125,00:19:26.791,You come out now!
00:19:33.625,00:19:35.083,"Little girl, where are ya?"
00:19:35.791,00:19:37.125,Where you at?
00:19:37.208,00:19:38.416,We need to split up!
00:20:22.208,00:20:24.333,Johanna! It's not safe! You'll fall!
00:20:27.708,00:20:29.708,Step back! Johanna!
00:21:20.250,00:21:21.250,Oh.
00:21:26.708,00:21:28.250,Running off like that?
00:21:32.250,00:21:34.375,I said she's wild. Didn't I say that?
00:21:34.458,00:21:36.708,"Please, Mr. Boudlin."
00:21:37.875,00:21:39.416,"Well, it's the goddamn truth."
00:21:42.750,00:21:44.375,Child's got a curse on her.
00:21:57.833,00:21:59.666,"Well, shit, Captain."
00:21:59.750,00:22:01.750,What the hell are you gonna do with her?
00:22:07.250,00:22:08.250,I'll take her.
00:22:10.125,00:22:12.250,I found her. I'll take her.
00:22:13.833,00:22:15.416,"You sure about that, Captain?"
00:22:16.541,00:22:19.000,Castroville's damn near 400 miles.
00:22:20.583,00:22:23.416,Those roads have changed since you lived down that way.
00:22:25.458,00:22:27.333,The little girl is lost.
00:22:29.000,00:22:30.708,She needs to be home.
00:22:41.333,00:22:44.250,Much obliged if you keep her. I'll be back first thing.
00:23:07.833,00:23:11.166,"She ain't been used in a while, but still runs pretty good."
00:23:24.083,00:23:25.083,You carrying?
00:23:26.291,00:23:27.541,Scattergun bird shot.
00:23:27.625,00:23:32.375,"I, uh… I kept mine from Palmito."
00:23:33.666,00:23:35.875,"Well, I'm sure you need it more than me."
00:23:36.458,00:23:38.000,Got 20 rounds too.
00:23:44.708,00:23:46.291,I'll fetch it back to ya.
00:23:46.958,00:23:48.291,Don't make no matter.
00:23:59.666,00:24:00.791,Captain.
00:24:01.416,00:24:03.041,Why are you doing this?
00:24:07.750,00:24:08.750,Johanna!
00:24:17.291,00:24:20.458,There we are. Come now. Come now.
00:25:25.583,00:25:27.583,Makes no matter to me what you wear.
00:25:39.833,00:25:43.083,We'll be on this road for about six days till we make Dallas.
00:25:44.166,00:25:46.583,Then across central Texas to the Hill Country.
00:25:47.125,00:25:48.583,It'll be a few weeks.
00:25:50.833,00:25:53.000,"We'll have to stop and give readings, of course."
00:25:53.083,00:25:54.500,We have to pay our way.
00:25:54.583,00:25:56.291,And keep an eye out for trouble.
00:25:57.583,00:26:02.750,"Settlers killing Indians for their land, and the Indians killing settlers for taking it."
00:26:05.208,00:26:07.458,I guess you know something about that.
00:26:11.500,00:26:13.916,"I'm Captain Kidd, by the by."
00:26:15.666,00:26:16.916,Captain.
00:26:17.000,00:26:18.333,Captain.
00:26:18.416,00:26:20.250,You're Johanna.
00:26:20.333,00:26:22.125,"You, Johanna."
00:26:27.291,00:26:30.750,"And it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, make no mistake."
00:26:58.041,00:26:59.250,This is the bacon.
00:26:59.875,00:27:01.458,I guess I'll make some.
00:27:03.708,00:27:05.541,Please would be nice to hear.
00:27:07.291,00:27:08.958,That's the way it works.
00:27:24.500,00:27:26.833,"Yeah, coffee packs a punch, doesn't it?"
00:27:31.083,00:27:32.500,It's an acquired taste.
00:27:38.166,00:27:39.333,That's sugar.
00:27:44.833,00:27:45.833,Hmm?
00:27:47.958,00:27:49.791,"Bit more to your liking, huh?"
00:27:50.791,00:27:52.041,"Easy, now."
00:27:54.291,00:27:56.000,"All right, that's enough."
00:27:56.083,00:27:57.166,That's enough.
00:27:58.708,00:27:59.833,Hey!
00:28:27.541,00:28:29.666,"printed in a line, one after the other?"
00:28:32.458,00:28:36.125,"Put them all together, and you have a story."
00:28:42.125,00:28:43.125,Story.
00:28:45.041,00:28:46.333,Stories.
00:28:50.833,00:28:52.250,"Well, go right ahead."
00:29:05.666,00:29:10.333,That's my wife… down in San Antonio.
00:29:38.250,00:29:40.041,I'm gonna get some more water.
00:31:06.750,00:31:08.416,"Wanna make your fortune, that's the place."
00:31:30.375,00:31:31.708,We must keep America whole!
00:31:38.208,00:31:42.916,"that our nation, our great nation, must be made complete!"
00:31:47.000,00:31:48.166,Mrs. Gannett.
00:31:51.000,00:31:52.041,"Hey, Kidd."
00:31:53.333,00:31:54.500,She yours?
00:32:02.291,00:32:05.750,"They paying you to take her home, or you doing it out of the goodness of your heart?"
00:32:05.833,00:32:08.333,"No, they're not paying me. I just know the road."
00:32:08.416,00:32:11.458,But I'll take a pair of rooms if you have them.
00:32:30.625,00:32:31.791,"Thank you, ma'am."
00:32:35.791,00:32:36.916,"No. No, no."
00:32:37.000,00:32:43.541,We don't use our hands and fingers. We-- Look. See this?
00:32:43.625,00:32:45.708,Spoon? Spoon?
00:32:45.791,00:32:48.041,This-- This is how we eat.
00:32:48.125,00:32:49.250,Spoon.
00:33:02.666,00:33:04.666,"And, uh, we-- we don't sing."
00:33:10.083,00:33:13.583,What y'all looking at? Ain't you never seen a child eat before?
00:33:16.500,00:33:17.750,What's her name?
00:33:18.666,00:33:19.666,Johanna.
00:33:22.041,00:33:23.791,She doesn't have any English.
00:33:24.333,00:33:26.333,So what does she speak?
00:33:26.416,00:33:27.416,Kiowa.
00:33:44.791,00:33:46.583,She said you've been calling her the wrong name.
00:33:46.666,00:33:47.916,Her name's Cicada.
00:33:50.416,00:33:52.750,"Well, it's Johanna now."
00:33:52.833,00:33:54.958,Johanna Leonberger.
00:34:23.125,00:34:25.166,No Kiowa family neither.
00:34:25.250,00:34:26.791,You see the hair?
00:34:26.875,00:34:29.125,They cut it when they're in mourning.
00:34:32.083,00:34:34.583,This child is an orphan twice over.
00:34:45.500,00:34:51.166,"Can you tell her that I am taking her to family, to an aunt and an uncle down near Castroville?"
00:34:51.250,00:34:54.416,"Kidd, she don't got any idea what that means."
00:34:56.041,00:34:59.833,"Well, they're the only ones that will take her."
00:35:00.708,00:35:03.208,She's got no place else. Nobody wants her.
00:35:18.625,00:35:20.166,"Yeah. Yeah, so I hear."
00:35:22.208,00:35:28.041,Mr. Gannett used to take them… before he went to California.
00:35:36.625,00:35:38.666,Maybe he just didn't wanna come back.
00:35:54.250,00:35:57.750,I do not have a clue as to the care of a child.
00:35:59.083,00:36:02.583,Never had the need nor the patience required.
00:36:02.666,00:36:05.833,"She's still alive, ain't she? That's not nothing."
00:36:39.458,00:36:43.208,Sleeping through the night isn't what it once was.
00:36:44.833,00:36:45.833,Yeah.
00:36:47.416,00:36:50.375,Your stories can only keep you company for so long.
00:36:55.041,00:36:58.416,"So, what you gonna do once you've taken her?"
00:37:00.708,00:37:02.666,I may just keep heading south.
00:37:06.541,00:37:10.375,Work passage on a ship out of Galveston.
00:37:12.041,00:37:19.000,Go see those far-off places I… read about to people every night.
00:37:29.083,00:37:30.458,How long's it been?
00:37:32.625,00:37:34.250,Close to five years now.
00:37:37.333,00:37:40.250,Castroville's San Antonio way.
00:37:41.666,00:37:43.458,"Yeah. Yes, it is."
00:37:47.666,00:37:49.958,Isn't it time you went back?
00:37:51.541,00:37:53.250,Made things right with her?
00:37:59.833,00:38:05.875,Looking at you now… I'm thinking you don't have a choice.
00:38:32.750,00:38:39.250,"Good evening. My name is Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd, and it is an honor to be back in the bustling city of Dallas."
00:38:40.125,00:38:45.833,"A busy town, and y'all are busy folk, so let's get right to it."
00:38:45.916,00:38:56.125,"Now, when I got in yesterday, I collected the latest newspapers, looking for suitable readings, something to take us away from our troubles."
00:38:56.666,00:39:20.208,"From The Times, on its page three… A word, Captain?"
00:39:21.208,00:39:22.333,Name's Almay.
00:39:23.333,00:39:24.958,These are my associates.
00:39:25.041,00:39:27.416,Mr. Almay. Gentlemen.
00:39:28.000,00:39:29.333,"Enjoyed your reading, Cap."
00:39:29.416,00:39:31.833,You take us away from our hard thoughts.
00:39:31.916,00:39:33.000,Thank you.
00:39:35.041,00:39:36.458,"So, where'd you serve, Captain?"
00:39:37.916,00:39:40.208,"Infantry, Third Texas. You?"
00:39:41.916,00:39:44.333,"First Texas Infantry, Northern Virginia."
00:39:45.333,00:39:46.958,Lot of good it did us.
00:39:47.041,00:39:49.125,Poor men fighting a rich man's war.
00:39:49.208,00:39:50.791,Left us lying here in the gutter.
00:39:52.833,00:39:56.208,"Way I see it, we fought, but ain't no piece of this ours."
00:39:56.291,00:39:59.583,"It's late, Mr. Almay. And what is your point?"
00:40:00.458,00:40:03.208,"Point is, us old soldiers gotta live, right?"
00:40:05.666,00:40:11.166,"Got a little business proposition for you, seeing you traveling alone like you are."
00:40:12.416,00:40:13.625,This young girl.
00:40:15.375,00:40:16.666,What do you want?
00:40:17.375,00:40:19.125,How much you want for her?
00:40:19.833,00:40:22.000,This child is not for sale.
00:40:24.333,00:40:27.500,Word is she's that captive out of Wichita Falls.
00:40:27.583,00:40:29.708,"Mr. Almay, you are well informed."
00:40:36.583,00:40:37.750,How about $50?
00:40:40.416,00:40:41.916,"All right, 100, then."
00:40:42.000,00:40:44.833,You can rest easy knowing at least she'll get paid.
00:40:45.875,00:40:47.458,"I mean, look at that fair skin."
00:40:48.708,00:40:51.041,I bet you were a lucky man out there in the desert.
00:40:52.250,00:40:53.916,You are scum.
00:40:54.000,00:40:55.916,"In the alternative, we could just take her."
00:40:58.083,00:41:01.250,"Oh, thank the Lord. We're local traders, sir."
00:41:01.333,00:41:05.708,We became concerned about the welfare of this here child in the clutches of a strange man such as this.
00:41:05.791,00:41:08.416,I am responsible for returning this child to her family down south.
00:41:08.500,00:41:10.083,-That's her papers and my oath. -Stay still.
00:41:10.875,00:41:12.250,Your hands.
00:41:13.041,00:41:14.041,Captain.
00:41:25.166,00:41:27.208,You take this girl and you get on your way.
00:41:35.583,00:41:38.916,I'm coming for you soon as I'm done with these blues.
00:41:44.583,00:41:45.583,Residency.
00:41:46.166,00:41:48.541,"12 Polk Street, Dallas, Texas."
00:42:49.083,00:42:49.916,Hyah!
00:43:10.458,00:43:12.083,Come on. Come on.
00:43:52.916,00:43:53.875,Hyah!
00:44:12.625,00:44:13.708,Come on.
00:46:02.083,00:46:03.666,Higher. Come. Come!
00:46:40.541,00:46:42.500,You're good for a man of years!
00:46:43.458,00:46:45.833,But ain't you just so damn tired of all this?
00:46:45.916,00:46:46.916,Help me.
00:46:49.166,00:46:52.625,Seems an awful shame for it to end like this when you can just join us.
00:46:52.708,00:46:57.791,"This world, rich pickings for some, slim pickings for the rest of us."
00:47:08.125,00:47:09.583,Oh. Goddamn it!
00:47:12.916,00:47:15.916,You go. Take the horses and go.
00:47:16.500,00:47:18.583,I shoot. You go.
00:47:22.916,00:47:24.041,Captain.
00:47:24.125,00:47:25.916,"No, no. No, this is worthless."
00:47:27.541,00:47:29.791,See this? It's for birds.
00:47:29.875,00:47:31.666,"It's for birds, understand?"
00:47:32.291,00:47:33.750,"You're not thinking straight, Cap."
00:47:35.625,00:47:37.166,She ain't worth dying for.
00:47:39.333,00:47:40.625,Go!
00:47:41.625,00:47:43.083,Get away while you can.
00:47:45.333,00:47:46.458,"What do you say, Cap?"
00:47:47.083,00:47:48.000,Talk to me.
00:47:55.708,00:47:56.750,Mr. Almay!
00:47:57.666,00:48:02.458,You have me in an uncomfortable circumstance!
00:48:06.041,00:48:08.541,How exactly are we gonna work this out?
00:48:09.750,00:48:12.833,I figure a share for each man and an extra for me!
00:48:14.333,00:48:18.500,Considering what you did to my associate over there!
00:48:19.875,00:48:21.416,That sounds pretty fair to me!
00:48:23.041,00:48:24.791,So what do you want me to do?
00:48:24.875,00:48:26.708,"Just gotta turn over the girl, that's all!"
00:48:26.791,00:48:27.708,"No! Johanna, no!"
00:48:28.875,00:48:30.125,They don't want our money.
00:48:30.208,00:48:31.916,-They want you! -Captain!
00:48:49.750,00:48:52.083,"Oh, Cap, what you trying to do, tickle us to death?"
00:48:52.166,00:48:54.625,"Well, we don't have a deal yet."
00:48:59.333,00:49:04.375,"Aha! I think it's 'cause you're out of bullets, and all you got left now is bird shot."
00:49:05.500,00:49:06.916,"Am I right, Cap?"
00:49:07.750,00:49:09.083,"All right, Almay."
00:49:10.083,00:49:11.583,"Damn it, you have a deal."
00:49:11.666,00:49:12.833,All right.
00:49:15.083,00:49:17.625,I'm gonna lay my gun down on this here rock.
00:49:17.708,00:49:19.083,How about you do the same?
00:49:20.625,00:49:22.500,Here's my sidearm.
00:49:22.583,00:49:23.958,Let me see yours.
00:49:24.041,00:49:26.000,I'm laying my weapon down.
00:49:30.000,00:49:31.000,Here's mine.
00:49:34.000,00:49:35.000,Dime-ah.
00:49:35.083,00:49:36.250,"Captain, boom?"
00:49:36.333,00:49:37.333,"Boom, boom."
00:49:46.708,00:49:48.375,Then how about you do the same?
00:49:49.666,00:49:51.125,Sounds good!
00:50:06.125,00:50:07.125,Stay down.
00:50:45.583,00:50:47.291,"Oh, goddamn it!"
00:50:48.500,00:50:50.583,"Well, now you done gone and spoiled it, Cap."
00:50:56.666,00:50:58.833,Looks like we're back on opposite sides.
00:50:58.916,00:51:00.166,Looks like it.
00:51:06.583,00:51:07.958,"All right, Cap."
00:51:08.708,00:51:11.000,Looks like I'm coming for you now.
00:53:34.250,00:53:35.250,Come on.
00:55:07.125,00:55:08.750,See that? See that bird?
00:55:10.458,00:55:11.541,Bird.
00:55:15.041,00:55:16.208,Bird.
00:55:17.208,00:55:18.208,Yeah.
00:55:19.625,00:55:20.708,"Yeah, that's good."
00:55:22.333,00:55:23.333,Gu-do.
00:55:25.083,00:55:26.083,Gu-do.
00:55:26.166,00:55:27.166,Gu-do.
00:55:28.291,00:55:29.958,A bird is gu-do?
00:55:31.375,00:55:32.375,Gu-do.
00:55:32.458,00:55:33.416,Gu-do.
00:55:45.375,00:55:49.791,"Since you're so smart, prickly pear cactus."
00:55:54.666,00:55:57.041,Pear cactus. And there's juniper out there.
00:55:58.416,00:56:00.416,And there's some sage.
00:56:01.333,00:56:02.500,Say-gya.
00:56:02.583,00:56:04.208,Say-juh?
00:56:04.291,00:56:05.333,Say-uh-gya.
00:56:05.416,00:56:06.958,Sage. Yeah.
00:56:07.708,00:56:09.541,That's right. It smells good.
00:56:10.208,00:56:11.500,Good.
00:56:11.583,00:56:12.583,Yeah.
00:56:12.666,00:56:15.666,"So, what else can you teach me in Kiowa?"
00:56:18.083,00:56:19.083,Dōm.
00:56:19.916,00:56:21.125,Dōm.
00:56:21.208,00:56:22.708,What is dōm?
00:56:26.375,00:56:27.416,Dōm.
00:56:28.416,00:56:30.500,The earth. All right.
00:56:31.041,00:56:32.541,Pahn.
00:56:32.625,00:56:33.708,The clouds?
00:56:35.083,00:56:36.083,The sky.
00:56:43.791,00:56:47.375,"Like, collected? Dōm? Daw?"
00:56:50.333,00:56:55.000,"Daw with a… is a spirit, a breath."
00:56:57.708,00:56:58.708,A circle.
00:57:02.125,00:57:06.000,"For us, it's more like a straight line."
00:57:06.875,00:57:07.875,A line.
00:57:09.791,00:57:10.916,Li-an.
00:57:11.000,00:57:12.125,"Li-an, yes."
00:57:12.208,00:57:14.750,We're all journeying across the prairie.
00:57:14.833,00:57:16.583,Straight line.
00:57:16.666,00:57:18.791,And looking for that place to be.
00:57:19.791,00:57:24.500,"And when we find it, we go straight out and we plow it and we plant it all in a straight line."
00:57:29.916,00:57:30.916,Yeah.
00:57:32.166,00:57:33.250,Very good.
00:57:33.833,00:57:34.875,Velly gut.
00:57:36.333,00:57:38.000,Velly gut indeed.
00:57:43.833,00:57:46.625,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:57:47.750,00:57:50.208,"Sehr gut, Onkel. You just spoke German."
00:57:51.208,00:57:52.416,Deutsch.
00:57:55.750,00:57:57.333,Can you remember anything else?
00:58:01.750,00:58:03.916,What else can you remember?
00:58:16.375,00:58:17.708,What?
00:58:17.791,00:58:18.958,What is it?
00:58:22.666,00:58:24.250,"Oh, dear God."
00:58:24.708,00:58:27.375,"Hyah, hyah! Hyah!"
00:58:27.458,00:58:29.500,You just leave that. You just leave it.
00:58:30.333,00:58:31.708,Forget it.
00:58:33.500,00:58:38.125,"I guess we both have demons to face, going down this road."
00:59:23.791,00:59:25.166,"Good day, gentlemen."
00:59:27.166,00:59:30.125,Ain't nobody unaccounted for getting into Erath County.
00:59:30.708,00:59:31.708,Is that the law?
00:59:32.875,00:59:34.125,It is now.
00:59:50.333,00:59:52.500,I'm carrying nothing of any great value.
01:00:05.833,01:00:07.083,"What's your name, sir?"
01:00:08.250,01:00:11.250,Kidd. Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd.
01:00:12.166,01:00:14.333,"And your reason for traveling, Cap?"
01:00:14.416,01:00:20.250,The news. I read the news to anyone with ten cents and the time to hear it.
01:00:24.833,01:00:25.916,Huh.
01:00:29.875,01:00:32.625,"My, my, my, my, my."
01:00:33.791,01:00:35.916,Carrying some damage back here.
01:00:36.583,01:00:41.500,I got the wagon cheap and the holes came with it.
01:00:43.500,01:00:47.958,"Well, your newspapers sure got holes in them, mister."
01:00:48.916,01:00:51.375,There ain't nothing in here about Erath County.
01:00:51.458,01:00:53.875,"Hell of a lot's been happening. Ain't that right, boys?"
01:00:59.125,01:01:02.666,We done fixed them Mexicans. Injuns too. Pushed them clean out.
01:01:03.291,01:01:07.125,"Mr. Farley, he killed a right smart of Indians."
01:01:11.791,01:01:15.000,We're building a whole new world down here in Erath County.
01:01:16.541,01:01:17.875,But ain't none of it writ here.
01:01:20.041,01:01:21.666,That news didn't travel.
01:01:23.250,01:01:24.416,Let's take care of that.
01:01:28.833,01:01:32.541,"What do you say, newsman?"
01:01:36.333,01:01:37.791,Go on. Move.
01:02:16.666,01:02:20.000,"When he gets done here, bring him into town."
01:02:58.125,01:03:00.208,What business is Mr. Farley in?
01:03:00.833,01:03:02.958,-Mr. Farl-- -Business is never mind your business.
01:03:08.333,01:03:09.333,What's your name?
01:03:10.375,01:03:11.416,John Calley.
01:03:14.000,01:03:16.250,"Is Mr. Farley family to you, John?"
01:03:16.833,01:03:19.916,"Nah, Mr. Farley, he ain't any kin of mine. No, no."
01:03:20.000,01:03:21.625,I ain't got no kin now Tommy's gone.
01:03:22.791,01:03:25.125,But I work for Mr. Farley all the same.
01:03:26.708,01:03:28.791,What happened to-- to Tommy?
01:03:29.541,01:03:35.541,Mr. Farley gone shot him… for hollering and questioning.
01:03:36.666,01:03:39.708,Got thoughts of things in his head. He couldn't keep them in there.
01:03:39.791,01:03:41.875,"Loud, loud mouth."
01:04:23.416,01:04:25.000,Have him read that.
01:04:35.250,01:04:36.250,"Hey, Captain."
01:04:37.708,01:04:39.916,Mr. Farley says to read this.
01:04:47.583,01:04:50.000,Dime-ah? Dime-ah?
01:04:51.208,01:04:52.583,-Dime-ah? -There you go.
01:05:05.458,01:05:06.625,Dime-ah?
01:05:09.750,01:05:10.750,Dime-ah?
01:05:29.250,01:05:49.583,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name… to read to y'all the news."
01:05:50.208,01:05:55.208,He's been kind enough to supply me with a copy of his own Erath Journal.
01:05:55.291,01:06:00.583,Sure looks like Mr. Farley is a very busy man in these parts.
01:06:01.750,01:06:05.583,"He's an editor and a publisher, a businessman, a lawgiver."
01:06:06.416,01:06:12.541,And all of you fine folk working for him at that.
01:06:13.291,01:06:14.291,Absolutely.
01:06:16.541,01:06:18.166,none of that is news.
01:06:19.416,01:06:25.916,So let me see if I can't tempt you with something else.
01:06:27.583,01:06:36.583,"The Harper's Illustrated, it has a story reporting from the lonely little town of Keel Run, Pennsylvania."
01:06:36.666,01:06:38.916,-I got a bad feeling about this. -Just give him a minute.
01:06:39.000,01:06:41.166,"Now, Keel Run ain't known for much."
01:06:41.250,01:06:46.416,"And I'm counting none of y'all have heard of it, since… Well, it is in the North. Why should you?"
01:06:48.750,01:06:57.416,"Keel Run is just one of a thousand little towns across our nation birthed by the work of many, but enjoyed by the few."
01:06:58.291,01:07:00.500,"Now, Keel Run is no Durand."
01:07:00.583,01:07:03.916,"It does not trade in buffalo, but in coal."
01:07:04.000,01:07:14.916,"And just like you, every morning, its men rise early from their beds only to descend into the great, black coal mine."
01:07:15.583,01:07:24.375,"On the morning of February 11th, 37 men of the Run attended their first shift at noon."
01:07:27.000,01:07:34.458,"Keel Run's wheel of fortune had turned, for the mine, the coal mine itself, had caught fire."
01:07:36.875,01:07:39.541,The first dozen died in an instant.
01:07:41.083,01:07:42.583,Another seven not long after.
01:07:44.375,01:08:01.791,"But I'm not here to tell you the story of those unfortunate souls or of the mine owner who'd been so lax about their safety, sitting up there in his fancy home, counting the money produced by their labor. No, no, no."
01:08:01.875,01:08:09.375,I'm here to tell you about the 11 men who lived… …who survived that fire.
01:08:09.458,01:08:14.916,The 11 men who fought back against their deadly fate.
01:08:15.583,01:08:16.916,Yes! Yes!
01:08:17.000,01:08:21.083,"Thought I told you to read from the Erath, Captain."
01:08:21.166,01:08:29.583,"Well, see, Mr. Farley, I was wondering if folks might prefer some storytelling Just for tonight, Mr. Farley."
01:08:29.666,01:08:32.916,"I think you ought to read from the Erath all the same, Captain."
01:08:34.375,01:08:37.708,Sort of thing these people expect to hear.
01:08:38.833,01:08:40.916,How about we vote on it?
01:08:41.000,01:08:42.000,Yeah!
01:08:44.416,01:08:53.000,"I can read from Mr. Farley's Erath Journal, or I can keep on with the story of the men of Keel Run."
01:08:55.708,01:08:57.458,Story! Story!
01:08:59.083,01:09:01.625,Keel Run? All right. Very good.
01:09:02.291,01:09:09.000,"That day, those 11 men were facing a mortal enemy… Go now. Shut this thing down. Go! Go!"
01:09:11.583,01:09:15.416,"-Show's over, folks! -Every pillar of progress of their own civilization."
01:09:20.250,01:09:22.875,Those men fought back!
01:09:24.791,01:09:27.041,"For better lives, for freedom!"
01:09:47.458,01:09:48.916,-Clear out! -Clear out!
01:10:19.125,01:10:21.083,"You should've just read, Captain."
01:10:22.625,01:10:24.916,"I was just giving the people the choice, Mr. Farley."
01:10:26.458,01:10:28.541,"Well, you can read now."
01:10:34.375,01:10:37.041,You got no idea what we deal with down here.
01:10:39.333,01:10:43.041,"Mexicans, Blacks, Indians."
01:10:44.166,01:10:49.833,"Give them an inch, and every one'll slit your throat where you piss."
01:10:55.750,01:10:58.125,We have to stop fighting sometime.
01:11:02.958,01:11:04.666,when it's ours alone.
01:11:07.416,01:11:10.583,Come here. Come on. Stand up!
01:11:22.666,01:11:24.833,"You ready to read, Cap?"
01:11:46.916,01:11:48.166,No! No!
01:12:04.458,01:12:05.708,I like your stories.
01:12:28.833,01:12:33.000,I ain't never heard of news reading as a business before.
01:12:35.875,01:12:39.666,"It's not a rich man's occupation, as you can see."
01:12:40.625,01:12:43.166,"Well, so how did you bother in it, then?"
01:12:45.500,01:12:52.083,"I was a printer by trade, and I had a printworks in San Antonio."
01:12:52.916,01:12:54.541,Printed up newspapers.
01:12:57.458,01:12:59.041,Then the war came.
01:13:01.333,01:13:04.458,"When it was over, it was all gone."
01:13:06.000,01:13:07.666,I lost everything.
01:13:08.958,01:13:12.083,Had to make a new life for myself right there.
01:13:18.000,01:13:21.250,"I couldn't print the newspapers anymore, but I could read them."
01:13:21.333,01:13:23.958,And that's what I've been doing from town to town.
01:13:27.458,01:13:28.916,You got family at all?
01:13:30.791,01:13:32.750,Left a wife in San Antonio.
01:13:34.750,01:13:35.750,Really?
01:14:51.000,01:14:52.166,Okay.
01:14:59.666,01:15:00.708,All right.
01:15:06.458,01:15:08.083,I could come with y'all.
01:15:10.125,01:15:13.000,"Yeah, I heard all about Hill Country."
01:15:13.666,01:15:15.041,That's Kiowa land.
01:15:15.666,01:15:18.208,"If they find you, they'd kill you."
01:15:20.875,01:15:22.708,"The railroad's that way, John."
01:15:23.791,01:15:25.416,Go make something of your own.
01:15:28.708,01:15:31.916,At least take this gun.
01:15:36.583,01:15:38.041,Just take it for her.
01:15:41.333,01:15:51.041,"Say, Captain, those men holed up in that mine, they really beat the fire and get home?"
01:15:56.458,01:15:58.916,"Yeah, they really did."
01:16:05.333,01:16:07.041,-Right there. -Ah!
01:16:11.041,01:16:12.500,"Well, goddamn."
01:16:13.458,01:16:14.875,"Ain't that something, huh?"
01:16:18.125,01:16:19.541,"Good luck to you, John."
01:16:19.625,01:16:20.625,Thank you.
01:16:59.208,01:17:01.791,Will you teach me that song you always sing?
01:17:02.375,01:18:21.708,"The one that goes… Whoa, whoa, whoa."
01:19:08.291,01:19:10.375,We have to stay on the main road!
01:19:10.458,01:19:11.916,Main road!
01:20:14.166,01:20:15.750,They aren't there anymore.
01:20:21.500,01:20:23.291,Su-hanna go.
01:22:24.000,01:22:25.750,"Mama, Papa, tot?"
01:22:28.333,01:22:30.666,Yes. They're dead.
01:23:04.625,01:23:07.708,I wanna get you away from all this pain and killing.
01:23:09.083,01:23:10.416,Get you clear of it.
01:23:12.833,01:23:14.875,"Going back, it's not good."
01:23:24.375,01:23:25.791,Move forward.
01:23:35.333,01:23:37.541,And don't look back. Hmm?
01:23:41.833,01:23:49.500,To move forward… you must first remember.
01:24:00.166,01:24:01.541,Whoa.
01:24:04.500,01:24:05.500,Whoa!
01:24:05.583,01:24:07.041,-Captain! -Hang on.
01:24:12.708,01:24:13.708,Take the reins!
01:24:28.791,01:24:29.916,"Jump! Jump, Johanna!"

01:28:25.416,01:28:26.500,Johanna!
01:28:29.250,01:28:30.541,Where are you?
01:28:36.666,01:28:37.833,Johanna!
01:28:39.583,01:28:40.791,Johanna!
01:28:42.666,01:28:43.875,Johanna!

01:29:42.708,01:29:43.958,Johanna!
01:32:14.041,01:32:17.333,Do we read story? Dime-ah?
01:32:19.666,01:32:21.958,"No, no story here."
01:32:23.375,01:32:24.750,No dime-ah?
01:32:26.083,01:32:27.833,"No, no dime-ah."
01:32:40.583,01:32:42.125,We go there?
01:32:43.791,01:32:44.791,Yes.
01:32:46.458,01:32:47.958,"Yes, we go there."
01:32:49.500,01:32:51.791,"No. No, Cap. No."
01:32:51.875,01:32:54.208,-We go dime-ah. We go. -No. No.
01:32:57.916,01:32:59.500,"No, we go."
01:32:59.583,01:33:04.500,"This is-- This is where you belong now, Johanna."
01:33:21.208,01:33:22.500,Good day.
01:33:22.583,01:33:26.166,I have business with the Leonberger family.
01:33:37.916,01:33:38.958,Anna.
01:33:52.083,01:33:54.208,she always went her own way.
01:33:54.750,01:33:57.083,"We said, Stay in Castroville."
01:33:57.166,01:34:02.708,"But she and her husband, Wolf, they wanted to be out there in the valley, where the land is cheaper."
01:34:05.583,01:34:07.375,he wouldn't listen.
01:34:21.166,01:34:24.250,She needs time to adjust.
01:34:24.875,01:34:26.916,She must work.
01:34:28.000,01:34:40.583,She must learn… Of course.
01:34:41.250,01:34:45.166,"You know, my sister, when we found her in the bedroom, they cut her throat."
01:34:46.625,01:34:51.083,"The baby sister, they bashed the brain out."
01:34:52.166,01:34:54.458,Best if she forgets all that.
01:34:56.625,01:34:59.250,She needs new memories.
01:35:02.500,01:35:04.333,Who knows what they will have taught her?
01:35:06.833,01:35:08.791,But we must try to see her as a blessing.
01:35:10.833,01:35:12.625,And we need the extra hands.
01:35:17.250,01:35:22.125,You want money for bring her here?
01:35:22.750,01:35:25.291,"No. No, I don't want your money."
01:35:27.708,01:35:29.250,Buy her books.
01:35:34.875,01:35:36.750,She likes stories.
01:36:17.000,01:36:19.083,You want some food for the journey?
01:36:26.375,01:36:27.625,"He's leaving, child."
01:36:32.541,01:36:35.833,"You ungrateful girl. This man, he brought you on home."
01:36:39.250,01:36:43.125,Maybe she doesn't understand what's happening.
01:39:59.375,01:40:02.875,"We'll have to inform Mr. Young about the rewriting in this contract, huh?"
01:40:02.958,01:40:04.083,"This, here."
01:40:10.541,01:40:11.541,My God.
01:40:13.375,01:40:19.250,"Gentlemen, this is… my dear old friend, Captain Jeffrey Kidd."
01:40:19.708,01:40:21.083,"Pleasure to meet you, sir."
01:40:23.041,01:40:24.083,Please.
01:40:42.250,01:40:43.416,in the garden.
01:40:47.750,01:40:49.750,It was cholera.
01:40:51.875,01:40:54.000,There's nothing you could have done.
01:40:56.458,01:40:57.791,Doctor said.
01:40:59.791,01:41:02.500,"It was being away for four years of war, Willie."
01:41:03.458,01:41:05.833,Four years with all the killing and all the blood.
01:41:08.583,01:41:10.708,Of wanting to go home every day.
01:41:12.375,01:41:15.333,Of wanting to see her and feel her.
01:41:16.583,01:41:25.750,To talk and laugh and dream… and think of having a family.
01:41:27.458,01:41:36.916,"Instead, I got a letter delivered to my tent, saying she was gone and already buried."
01:41:40.541,01:41:41.875,That's when I knew.
01:41:43.833,01:41:46.625,God's curse on me had taken her.
01:41:48.416,01:41:51.458,"It was sickness, Jeff, just sickness."
01:41:51.541,01:41:53.125,It wasn't sickness.
01:41:54.375,01:42:02.750,It was judgment for all I had seen… and all I had done.
01:42:09.541,01:42:16.083,I've known you 50 years… since we were boys.
01:42:19.208,01:42:21.416,We didn't ask for any of this.
01:42:23.208,01:42:25.416,But it fell to us to do the fighting.
01:42:28.333,01:42:29.416,We lived.
01:42:32.125,01:42:33.166,She died.
01:42:36.333,01:42:37.875,That's not judgment.
01:42:40.625,01:42:45.958,It's just what we had to face and carry the rest of our days.
01:45:53.208,01:45:54.500,Hyah!
01:45:54.583,01:45:55.583,Hah!
01:46:01.791,01:46:02.791,Giddyap!
01:47:38.875,01:47:40.333,We had to tie her.
01:47:42.375,01:47:43.541,She runs away.
01:47:45.375,01:47:46.875,She's a child.
01:47:48.375,01:47:51.625,She… no work.
01:47:54.708,01:47:55.791,My mistake.
01:47:59.541,01:48:01.125,She doesn't belong here.
01:48:16.041,01:48:17.500,I'm sorry.
01:48:35.416,01:48:36.666,Johanna.
01:48:54.250,01:48:59.125,Yes… if that's what you want.
01:50:14.833,01:50:16.458,"Captain, Johanna go."
01:50:59.125,01:51:04.333,A man dead and buried has risen from the grave.
01:51:05.000,01:51:13.791,"Three days ago, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, a Mr. Alfred Blackstone of 47 years fell into a stupor."
01:51:14.708,01:51:21.291,"His wife called the physician, but there being no pulse, it was determined that Mr. Blackstone was, most unfortunately, dead."
01:51:22.458,01:51:32.583,"He was buried very swiftly on the grounds of the local church, where, as divine providence would have it, a wedding was due to take place the following day!"
01:51:34.958,01:51:39.291,"But nearing the church doors, the bride abruptly stopped."
01:51:40.083,01:51:56.833,"From the cemetery beyond, she had heard this inexplicable sound… The desperate, unmistakable hammering of life."
01:51:58.708,01:52:10.083,"In a state of frantic excitement, she ran to a nearby grave marked 'Alfred Blackstone.' And within moments, the entire wedding congregation was digging!"
01:52:17.500,01:52:18.833,very much alive.
01:52:21.833,01:52:51.500,"And from his widow Blackstone's embrace, Alfred turned to the groom and said, and I quote, 'Feller, when you get in that church and she says, Till death us do part, don't you believe a word of it!' My name is Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd."
01:52:52.083,01:52:55.083,This is Miss Johanna Kidd.
01:53:01.083,01:53:03.041,That is all the news of the world we have for you.
01:53:03.125,01:53:04.500,"We thank you, and good night."
