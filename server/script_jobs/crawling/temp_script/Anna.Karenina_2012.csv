00:02:02.081,00:02:04.458,I picked it out for Daria Alexandrovna and the children.
00:02:07.377,00:02:08.587,"Bonjour, Lili."
00:02:08.629,00:02:10.171,Bonjour.
00:02:11.882,00:02:13.174,"Bonjour, Grisha."
00:02:13.216,00:02:14.217,Bonjour.
00:02:15.010,00:02:16.136,Vasya.
00:02:19.389,00:02:21.016,Who is coming to see Grand-maman?
00:02:21.058,00:02:22.142,CHILDREN: Me! Me! Me!
00:02:26.396,00:02:28.148,"Come along, my little ducklings."
00:02:58.512,00:03:00.179,Be good today. I'm off.
00:03:04.309,00:03:05.894,Read the chapter carefully.
00:03:05.936,00:03:07.062,I'll come back to test you on it.
00:03:08.730,00:03:10.189,Read it twice.
00:03:23.537,00:03:24.872,Au revoir.
00:03:41.304,00:03:42.723,"Oh, Stiva."
00:04:06.914,00:04:08.665,Aunt Dolly found a note from the governess.
00:04:08.707,00:04:10.291,Well?
00:04:10.333,00:04:13.879,Stiva wants me to come to Moscow to persuade Dolly to forgive him.
00:04:13.921,00:04:17.758,I'm to be deprived of my wife so that adultery may be forgiven?
00:04:19.134,00:04:21.011,I can't excuse him just because he's your brother.
00:04:21.053,00:04:22.930,"Oh, it's for Dolly's sake, too."
00:04:22.971,00:04:24.223,Four committees today.
00:04:25.348,00:04:26.307,I have the world waiting for me.
00:04:26.349,00:04:29.519,There's never time to look at your exercises.
00:04:29.561,00:04:33.107,"Serozha is doing very well, Your Excellency."
00:04:33.148,00:04:34.900,Who put this shirt on you?
00:04:34.942,00:04:37.485,"Well, never mind."
00:04:37.527,00:04:40.321,"KARENIN: Tomorrow, perhaps."
00:04:40.363,00:04:42.741,"Thank you, Lukich."
00:04:44.284,00:04:45.994,"No. No, no, not tomorrow."
00:04:46.036,00:04:47.328,"LUKICH: Thank you, Your Excellency."
00:04:47.370,00:04:49.330,Come along.
00:04:49.372,00:04:55.336,"Alexei, do you think nine years of marriage and children should count for nothing against an infatuation?"
00:04:55.378,00:04:58.006,No. Very well.
00:04:58.048,00:05:01.468,"But sin has a price, you may be sure of that."
00:05:03.303,00:05:04.345,But why?
00:05:04.387,00:05:06.347,ANNA: Because that's where Aunt Dolly lives.
00:05:06.389,00:05:09.350,But why?
00:05:09.392,00:05:11.352,She's not well.
00:05:11.394,00:05:12.980,"But why, Mama?"
00:05:13.021,00:05:15.149,Don't make Mama cry.
00:05:15.190,00:05:16.984,"I'll be back before you know, and bring you a present."
00:05:17.025,00:05:19.987,I don't want a present.
00:05:20.028,00:05:22.530,"Oh, my little Kotik."
00:05:22.572,00:05:24.365,What present?
00:05:51.601,00:05:53.854,It's the first time I've left my little boy.
00:05:53.895,00:05:58.192,"So, you're leaving your son and I'm returning to mine."
00:05:58.233,00:06:00.110,I'm Countess Vronskaya.
00:06:00.152,00:06:03.404,I've been in St. Petersburg for the christening of a granddaughter.
00:06:03.446,00:06:05.364,My eldest son married Princess Chirkov.
00:06:11.330,00:06:13.372,You're a charming creature.
00:06:14.457,00:06:16.251,"I've never been in Moscow society, really."
00:06:16.293,00:06:17.585,But you know my name.
00:06:17.627,00:06:20.255,I've heard you mentioned.
00:06:23.466,00:06:24.926,"Ah, love."
00:06:25.635,00:06:27.846,Was it love?
00:06:28.555,00:06:30.307,My sons are ashamed of me.
00:06:30.349,00:06:32.851,But I'd rather end up wishing I hadn't than end up wishing I had.
00:06:32.893,00:06:34.269,Wouldn't you?
00:06:35.062,00:06:36.313,I don't know.
00:07:04.591,00:07:07.468,"Some man came without an appointment, Your Excellency."
00:07:07.510,00:07:08.469,Waiting outside.
00:07:10.222,00:07:12.266,Levin!
00:07:12.307,00:07:13.892,I'm very anxious to see you.
00:07:15.518,00:07:16.477,I need your advice.
00:07:16.519,00:07:17.979,"Well, come into my room, then."
00:07:18.021,00:07:21.482,"This is my oldest friend, Konstantin Dmitrievich Levin."
00:07:21.524,00:07:23.693,Someone send word I'll be a few minutes late.
00:07:25.404,00:07:26.738,"That's my office, up there."
00:07:29.532,00:07:32.202,"Oh, I've been hard at it."
00:07:32.244,00:07:33.494,"Hard at what, exactly?"
00:07:33.536,00:07:35.538,"Well, we're overwhelmed with work."
00:07:35.580,00:07:36.957,Paperwork.
00:07:36.998,00:07:39.084,Paperwork is the soul of Russia.
00:07:39.126,00:07:41.920,"Now, when am I going to come and shoot some snipe?"
00:07:45.465,00:07:48.135,"Look at you, in Western clothes you told me you'd never wear again."
00:07:48.176,00:07:49.303,Something's up.
00:07:49.344,00:07:52.847,"Yes, I'm in love."
00:07:54.557,00:07:55.892,Have you guessed who she is?
00:07:55.934,00:07:58.895,I... I have a suspicion.
00:07:58.937,00:08:01.106,I decided it was impossible.
00:08:01.148,00:08:04.525,"Kitty is of the heavens, an angel."
00:08:04.567,00:08:08.488,"But then, I thought and thought, and there's no life for me without her."
00:08:09.572,00:08:11.532,Do I have a chance?
00:08:11.574,00:08:12.700,The Shcherbatskys are giving a soiree this evening.
00:08:12.742,00:08:14.535,"Get there early, before the crowd."
00:08:14.577,00:08:16.163,And if I may suggest...
00:08:16.204,00:08:18.415,New boots.
00:08:20.041,00:08:21.335,We'd better have dinner together.
00:08:21.376,00:08:22.961,Come on.
00:08:23.003,00:08:24.545,Or do you prefer the Hermitage?
00:08:24.587,00:08:26.381,"Let's say, 5:30 at l'Angleterre."
00:08:26.423,00:08:29.468,"I owe them more than the Hermitage, so it wouldn't be fair to withdraw my custom."
00:08:29.509,00:08:34.055,"Uh, so, new boots, coat, and a proper hat."
00:09:16.639,00:09:18.808,Excuse me.
00:09:18.850,00:09:20.601,Do you...
00:09:20.643,00:09:21.895,Do you...
00:09:24.272,00:09:25.524,Excuse me.
00:09:52.675,00:09:53.885,It's so unfair.
00:09:54.761,00:09:56.721,You marry for love.
00:09:56.763,00:09:58.265,You're a good husband.
00:09:59.474,00:10:02.936,"Children arrive, years depart."
00:10:02.977,00:10:07.648,"And all of a sudden, your wife grows old and tired."
00:10:07.690,00:10:10.235,And her hair is thin.
00:10:10.277,00:10:13.654,"And you yourself, you still have your vigor!"
00:10:13.696,00:10:16.657,And then you find yourself a martyr to distraction by so many women.
00:10:16.699,00:10:18.659,"Forgive me, but I find that incomprehensible."
00:10:18.701,00:10:22.330,"As though, I should leave this restaurant and steal a roll from a baker's shop."
00:10:22.372,00:10:23.915,"Well, you know, a freshly baked roll."
00:10:23.957,00:10:27.586,"I'm talking about love, and you're talking about your appetite."
00:10:27.627,00:10:30.255,Easily confused.
00:10:30.297,00:10:31.839,Who? No. Why?
00:10:31.881,00:10:33.925,He's your rival.
00:10:33.967,00:10:35.552,Who is he?
00:10:35.594,00:10:37.678,"Oh, you don't need to worry about him."
00:10:37.720,00:10:42.100,"He's a rich, good-looking cavalry officer who has nothing better to do than make love to pretty women."
00:10:42.142,00:10:43.477,Is that cabbage soup?
00:10:43.518,00:10:46.687,"Potage aux choux a la russe, as the gentleman ordered."
00:10:46.729,00:10:48.648,It's what I wanted.
00:10:50.400,00:10:53.694,"Understand that, for me, tonight is a question of life and death."
00:10:53.736,00:10:55.696,Kostya...
00:10:55.738,00:10:58.199,"Kostya, Kitty would be mad to refuse you."
00:10:58.241,00:11:00.994,"And Dolly's on your side, you know?"
00:11:01.035,00:11:04.747,"She says her sister Kitty was always meant to be your wife, and will be."
00:11:04.789,00:11:05.915,Dolly said that?
00:11:07.959,00:11:09.752,I've always thought your Dolly was a gem.
00:11:09.794,00:11:10.962,She is.
00:11:11.963,00:11:13.507,She is.
00:11:13.548,00:11:15.383,I loved her to distraction.
00:11:16.759,00:11:18.219,KITTY: Konstantin!
00:11:20.347,00:11:21.722,Konstantin!
00:11:26.394,00:11:28.104,Konstantin!
00:11:28.146,00:11:30.315,I'm too early.
00:11:30.357,00:11:32.233,No. Come up.
00:12:04.432,00:12:05.933,Look at me.
00:12:05.975,00:12:08.936,"I'm receiving for Papa and Maman, who are late to dress."
00:12:08.978,00:12:10.771,It's my first reception.
00:12:11.814,00:12:13.732,Princess Ekaterina.
00:12:15.193,00:12:16.611,Delighted. Delighted.
00:12:17.904,00:12:21.199,"I'm so pleased you were able to be with us, Konstantin Dmitrievich."
00:12:21.991,00:12:23.742,"Kitty, you look..."
00:12:25.495,00:12:27.830,You look...
00:12:27.872,00:12:28.956,How long are you staying?
00:12:28.998,00:12:31.501,I don't know.
00:12:35.422,00:12:39.634,What I mean to say is I...
00:12:39.676,00:12:41.219,I only came with one purpose.
00:12:43.513,00:12:45.098,I want to...
00:12:49.852,00:12:51.812,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
00:12:51.854,00:12:53.981,Wrong moment.
00:12:54.023,00:12:55.233,But will you?
00:12:57.860,00:12:58.945,I can't.
00:13:06.869,00:13:07.870,I'm sorry.
00:13:09.163,00:13:10.164,Yes.
00:13:11.249,00:13:12.791,It was impossible.
00:13:17.130,00:13:18.839,I'm sorry.
00:13:18.881,00:13:20.841,Are you the brother of Nikolai Levin?
00:13:20.883,00:13:21.926,Yes.
00:13:21.968,00:13:25.555,He's in Moscow.
00:13:25.597,00:13:26.847,How do you know?
00:13:26.889,00:13:28.807,It's the sort of thing I know.
00:13:34.314,00:13:35.482,Count Vronsky?
00:13:35.898,00:13:36.857,Yes?
00:13:50.413,00:13:52.373,Princess Kitty.
00:13:52.415,00:13:54.875,"It's been so long, and yet, it seems like yesterday."
00:13:54.917,00:13:56.835,It was yesterday.
00:14:23.863,00:14:24.947,Excuse me.
00:14:25.406,00:14:26.533,No.
00:14:28.117,00:14:29.243,Sorry.
00:15:05.154,00:15:06.947,It's Kostya.
00:15:06.989,00:15:08.449,Good God! Look at him.
00:15:09.784,00:15:11.411,You look like a capitalist.
00:15:11.994,00:15:13.454,What do you want?
00:15:13.496,00:15:15.915,Nothing.
00:15:18.501,00:15:20.670,"Good evening, miss..."
00:15:20.712,00:15:23.089,Don't talk to her like that.
00:15:25.174,00:15:27.176,More vodka for my brother!
00:15:28.010,00:15:29.387,I don't want anything.
00:15:30.179,00:15:31.681,I'm all right.
00:15:35.268,00:15:36.977,Who told you where to find me?
00:15:37.019,00:15:40.940,A colonel in the Third Department.
00:15:42.024,00:15:43.109,Good.
00:15:44.193,00:15:45.862,They must think I'm dangerous.
00:15:47.280,00:15:48.907,What have you got to smile about?
00:15:48.948,00:15:49.990,Nothing.
00:15:50.032,00:15:51.242,That's right.
00:15:51.284,00:15:55.996,The day is coming.
00:15:56.038,00:15:58.625,You're on the wrong side of history.
00:15:58.666,00:16:03.212,Not because privilege But because it's irrational.
00:16:05.715,00:16:07.007,He's sick!
00:16:07.049,00:16:08.968,"Let go, if you know what's good for you."
00:16:10.052,00:16:11.971,I took Marya Nikolaevna from a brothel.
00:16:13.640,00:16:16.016,But I consider her my wife.
00:16:16.058,00:16:18.311,"If her presence offends, you're free to leave."
00:16:21.481,00:16:22.941,Are you married?
00:16:24.776,00:16:26.110,No.
00:16:26.152,00:16:29.614,Why not?
00:16:29.656,00:16:31.741,No.
00:16:31.783,00:16:34.410,Romantic love will be the last illusion of the old order.
00:16:36.454,00:16:38.205,You should marry one of your peasants.
00:16:38.247,00:16:40.667,Yes. I damn well should.
00:16:42.961,00:16:44.462,The brotherhood of man!
00:16:57.183,00:16:59.018,"Nikolai, you need to see a doctor."
00:17:01.270,00:17:03.690,Then come and stay with me at Pokrovskoe till you get your health back.
00:17:03.731,00:17:05.024,With my wife?
00:17:05.692,00:17:06.734,If you...
00:17:07.902,00:17:08.945,Or...
00:17:09.696,00:17:11.948,Or go abroad to a spa.
00:17:13.741,00:17:16.285,I'll send more if that's what you want.
00:17:27.421,00:17:29.089,"Hello, what's this?"
00:17:29.131,00:17:32.719,Austrian royalty on their honeymoon.
00:17:32.760,00:17:34.929,The private carriage will stop opposite the stand.
00:17:34.971,00:17:37.640,Bad luck.
00:17:38.140,00:17:39.141,Food.
00:17:40.309,00:17:41.853,Here's the train.
00:17:52.739,00:17:53.740,Oh.
00:18:03.165,00:18:04.584,I'll come back.
00:18:13.968,00:18:15.135,Stiva!
00:18:16.178,00:18:17.179,Anna!
00:18:21.392,00:18:24.020,You don't look ashamed!
00:18:25.646,00:18:27.565,"Yes, of course."
00:18:31.193,00:18:32.361,"Charmante, don't you think?"
00:18:52.090,00:18:53.382,"There, Countess."
00:18:53.424,00:18:55.468,"You have found your son, and I have found my brother."
00:18:55.509,00:18:57.344,"Madam Karenina has a son, too."
00:18:57.386,00:19:00.180,"It's the first time they've been apart, so she frets about him."
00:19:00.222,00:19:02.600,Excuse me for not recognizing you before.
00:19:04.393,00:19:06.186,"Au revoir, Countess."
00:19:06.228,00:19:08.188,Let me kiss that pretty face.
00:19:28.250,00:19:31.211,Keep your people inside until this has been cleared up.
00:19:33.255,00:19:35.591,"The sole supporter of a large family, they say."
00:19:35.633,00:19:37.384,"Well, can't anything be done for them?"
00:19:37.426,00:19:39.178,"Wait for me, Maman."
00:19:43.683,00:19:46.226,VRONSKY: Stand back.
00:19:46.268,00:19:48.187,I have you to thank for that.
00:19:51.273,00:19:54.068,OBLONSKY: Oh!
00:19:54.944,00:19:56.904,What a good fellow.
00:19:56.946,00:19:59.239,ANNA: Have you known Count Vronsky long?
00:19:59.281,00:20:01.575,Did you like him?
00:20:02.284,00:20:03.452,Oh.
00:20:05.705,00:20:08.666,But we should be discussing you and Dolly.
00:20:08.708,00:20:10.250,What have you got to say for yourself?
00:20:10.292,00:20:13.253,I've said it all.
00:20:13.295,00:20:14.421,Now I need you to say it.
00:20:14.463,00:20:16.256,"I'm going to the office, so you'll have Dolly to yourself."
00:20:16.298,00:20:17.884,Don't be late home.
00:20:22.304,00:20:24.348,Kitty's coming by to see you.
00:20:24.390,00:20:27.643,She's all grown up and a bit frightened of you.
00:20:27.685,00:20:29.854,The belle of St. Petersburg society.
00:20:29.896,00:20:32.272,Is that who I am?
00:20:35.693,00:20:37.111,Dolly.
00:20:39.321,00:20:41.032,Stiva has told me.
00:20:44.535,00:20:46.662,"Oh, Dolly, I'm sorry."
00:20:46.704,00:20:49.289,From the bottom of my heart.
00:20:49.331,00:20:51.542,I don't know what to do.
00:20:51.584,00:20:53.878,I know. I know.
00:20:53.920,00:20:56.296,I can't bear to be with him.
00:20:56.338,00:20:58.883,And he doesn't care.
00:20:58.925,00:21:02.302,What he wants is you.
00:21:02.344,00:21:04.597,You and the children are everything to him.
00:21:04.638,00:21:06.015,Are we?
00:21:06.057,00:21:07.725,And there is room for a governess?
00:21:07.767,00:21:11.687,"That was shameful, disgraceful, but it was not love."
00:21:11.729,00:21:14.481,"It was the animal in man, not the soul."
00:21:14.523,00:21:16.400,Stiva's remorse is from the soul.
00:21:17.359,00:21:19.153,"Well, what about me?"
00:21:20.029,00:21:22.322,Does his remorse make it easier for me?
00:21:22.364,00:21:26.326,I know you are suffering.
00:21:26.368,00:21:30.289,Is there enough love left in your heart?
00:21:32.541,00:21:36.545,"Well, when I think of them together, I can't forgive him."
00:21:36.587,00:21:37.838,No.
00:21:37.880,00:21:41.383,My poor lamb.
00:21:41.425,00:21:42.676,My fate?
00:21:44.178,00:21:47.347,But I haven't done anything!
00:21:47.389,00:21:49.183,"Do you love him, Dolly?"
00:21:54.647,00:21:57.357,"You love him, and he loves you."
00:21:57.399,00:21:58.734,But you can't forgive.
00:21:58.776,00:22:01.904,"So, your lives must continue like this forever, with both of you wretched."
00:22:05.449,00:22:08.535,"Oh, that's pretty."
00:22:08.577,00:22:09.870,Yes.
00:22:09.912,00:22:11.371,Look for the G for Grisha.
00:22:11.413,00:22:13.666,Here.
00:22:13.707,00:22:15.293,Can you do your whole name?
00:22:15.334,00:22:17.377,Doesn't that look like a princess? No?
00:22:18.504,00:22:21.882,OBLONSKY: I'm home!
00:22:21.924,00:22:24.051,"Now, where are my little ducklings?"
00:22:26.428,00:22:28.388,CHILDREN: Papa! Papa!
00:22:28.430,00:22:29.473,Papa!
00:22:33.435,00:22:35.646,"Will you stay for the Bobrishchevs' ball, Anna?"
00:22:35.688,00:22:38.274,Oh. I always feel dull at a ball.
00:22:38.316,00:22:40.318,Ah!
00:22:40.358,00:22:42.820,"Stiva, tell Anna she must come to the ball."
00:22:42.862,00:22:44.404,"Well, of course she must."
00:22:46.949,00:22:48.284,And God go with you.
00:22:49.618,00:22:51.787,You can introduce me to your new governess.
00:22:51.829,00:22:54.372,But she's old!
00:22:57.251,00:22:58.502,I know why you want me to come.
00:22:58.544,00:23:03.632,You want everyone to be there because you're quite sure it's going to be your night.
00:23:03.674,00:23:05.383,How did you know?
00:23:07.469,00:23:08.512,I know everything.
00:23:11.473,00:23:13.391,"Oh, to be your age again."
00:23:14.476,00:23:15.853,Surrounded by that...
00:23:16.478,00:23:17.730,That blue mist.
00:23:18.731,00:23:20.774,"I was 18, too, when I got married."
00:23:37.958,00:23:40.169,Is the prince at home?
00:23:40.211,00:23:42.088,"SERVANT: He's just gone up, I believe."
00:23:42.129,00:23:43.923,Is nobody receiving?
00:23:43.964,00:23:47.093,"I can enquire, sir."
00:23:48.344,00:23:51.764,The princess retired early.
00:24:02.440,00:24:04.110,No. Thank you.
00:24:53.575,00:24:55.535,We thought you would come back married.
00:24:55.577,00:24:56.745,Did you?
00:25:00.166,00:25:02.500,But you only came back with a hat.
00:25:03.377,00:25:05.963,A black silk hat.
00:25:06.005,00:25:08.548,What kind of animal can you make a hat like that from?
00:25:08.590,00:25:10.217,It's not natural.
00:25:11.677,00:25:13.511,"Next time, perhaps."
00:25:14.430,00:25:16.390,There'll be no next time.
00:26:04.938,00:26:06.023,Kitty.
00:26:07.649,00:26:08.650,May I have a waltz?
00:26:08.692,00:26:10.610,"You may, Boris."
00:26:10.652,00:26:13.613,"I'll save you the third, just because it's your first ball."
00:26:13.655,00:26:15.366,You're my first conquest!
00:26:43.685,00:26:45.771,Where do you want to be taken?
00:26:46.730,00:26:48.065,There.
00:27:05.749,00:27:07.334,"How are you, Stiva?"
00:27:07.376,00:27:09.669,"Thanks to Anna, I am a happy man."
00:27:09.711,00:27:11.671,No. Ask Anna.
00:27:11.713,00:27:13.382,"No, I don't..."
00:27:16.718,00:27:18.762,"Come on, then."
00:27:56.425,00:27:59.719,"This vile, idiotic matchmaking of yours."
00:27:59.761,00:28:02.222,"For goodness' sake, what have I done?"
00:28:03.765,00:28:05.351,Is anything the matter?
00:28:05.392,00:28:06.644,No.
00:28:11.148,00:28:13.691,"You look as lovely as ever, Princess Kitty."
00:28:22.951,00:28:24.744,"Don't ask me, Maman."
00:28:25.703,00:28:27.289,"Kitty, it's us next."
00:28:29.667,00:28:32.710,"Princess, I have the honor to claim my dance."
00:28:52.856,00:28:55.984,He'll dance the mazurka with Kitty. You'll see.
00:29:17.506,00:29:19.216,OBLONSKY: I am! I really am!
00:29:26.848,00:29:28.225,Dance with me.
00:29:30.227,00:29:34.273,I'm not used to being spoken to like that by a man I met once at a railway station.
00:29:34.314,00:29:39.778,"I dare say, but if I'm not to dance with you, then I'm getting out of this operetta and going home."
00:29:41.029,00:29:42.781,"Then, for Kitty's sake."
00:31:16.249,00:31:17.417,That's my sister.
00:33:05.066,00:33:09.529,GUARD: Next stop is Bologoye!
00:33:32.469,00:33:34.137,Can I be of service to you?
00:33:38.099,00:33:39.476,Why are you leaving Moscow?
00:33:41.353,00:33:43.021,What else can I do?
00:33:44.815,00:33:46.065,I have to be where you are.
00:33:46.107,00:33:47.734,"Stop, that's enough."
00:33:48.902,00:33:50.028,Go back to Kitty.
00:33:50.946,00:33:52.030,No.
00:33:53.198,00:33:54.574,This is wrong.
00:33:54.616,00:33:56.117,It makes no difference.
00:33:56.159,00:33:57.327,You have no right.
00:33:57.369,00:33:59.037,It makes no difference.
00:34:00.330,00:34:01.999,You must forget me.
00:34:03.124,00:34:05.251,"If you're a good man, you'll forget everything."
00:34:05.293,00:34:07.504,And you? Will you forget?
00:34:10.007,00:34:11.132,Yes.
00:34:44.416,00:34:45.792,Is Serozha all right?
00:34:45.834,00:34:47.293,"Oh, is that all I get?"
00:34:47.335,00:34:48.420,"Yes, he's quite well."
00:34:50.171,00:34:51.297,Were you a success?
00:34:51.339,00:34:52.507,I?
00:34:52.549,00:34:54.092,"Oh, Dolly and Stiva."
00:34:55.176,00:34:56.344,"Yes, I think so."
00:35:01.266,00:35:03.101,I'll announce myself.
00:35:04.227,00:35:07.773,Vronsky.
00:35:07.814,00:35:10.067,"Baroness, coffee from the new coffee pot for Count Vronsky."
00:35:11.443,00:35:13.319,I'll be off home if I'm in the way.
00:35:13.361,00:35:15.572,"You're at home where you are, Baroness."
00:35:15.614,00:35:18.825,"Oh! Oh, Pierre, you never say such pretty things to me."
00:35:18.867,00:35:20.660,We were just discussing my husband.
00:35:20.702,00:35:22.746,"He won't divorce me, you see, and do you know why?"
00:35:22.788,00:35:25.665,No.
00:35:25.707,00:35:27.042,I want to bring an action.
00:35:27.084,00:35:30.670,"Just because I'm supposed to be unfaithful, I don't see why I have to eat off Pierre's crockery."
00:35:30.712,00:35:31.922,Look at it!
00:35:32.672,00:35:34.091,It's my crockery.
00:35:34.132,00:35:35.174,Oh!
00:35:35.216,00:35:36.593,PETRITSKY: How was Moscow?
00:35:37.385,00:35:38.720,Provincial.
00:36:04.913,00:36:06.205,Thank you for my presents.
00:36:40.949,00:36:43.785,I'm writing to Dolly and to Kitty.
00:36:45.787,00:36:47.205,You are good.
00:36:59.968,00:37:01.469,Time for bed.
00:37:05.765,00:37:08.977,What are they saying in Moscow about the new statute?
00:37:09.728,00:37:11.229,What new statute?
00:37:12.731,00:37:14.273,The new statute I carried in Council.
00:37:16.943,00:37:18.236,No one mentioned it.
00:37:19.320,00:37:20.363,Really?
00:37:22.365,00:37:23.491,Oh.
00:37:26.327,00:37:28.496,"Here, it caused quite a sensation."
00:38:00.862,00:38:01.947,Princess Betsy.
00:38:02.363,00:38:03.364,Cousin.
00:38:03.406,00:38:05.408,I didn't know you were an art lover.
00:38:05.450,00:38:07.160,I'm prepared to be one.
00:38:48.409,00:38:52.371,Countess Lydia tells me you haven't been to one of her evenings since you returned.
00:38:52.413,00:38:53.748,The last one was to meet a missionary.
00:38:53.790,00:38:58.211,The one before that was for a lecture on the union of the Greek and Roman Churches.
00:39:00.255,00:39:02.174,"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:39:02.215,00:39:03.800,I know you're fond of her.
00:39:05.135,00:39:06.678,"Come on, or we'll be late."
00:39:27.324,00:39:28.908,"Here's the thing, Vronsky."
00:39:28.950,00:39:31.786,"A posting's come up, and there's a promotion in it for you."
00:39:31.828,00:39:32.829,"Thank you, sir."
00:39:32.871,00:39:34.413,In the garrison in Tashkent.
00:39:34.455,00:39:36.374,Tashkent? But...
00:39:37.834,00:39:41.713,"I would like to stay in Peter, sir, if you don't mind."
00:39:41.754,00:39:43.381,"Well, I don't mind."
00:39:44.632,00:39:48.136,But your mother...
00:40:04.903,00:40:10.158,"Your husband is a saint, and we must all cherish him for Russia's sake."
00:40:16.581,00:40:18.875,You didn't come to my dinner.
00:40:18.917,00:40:20.459,I had to see my Commanding Officer.
00:40:20.501,00:40:22.795,"Well, she didn't come either."
00:40:26.507,00:40:28.760,I do hope you can come on afterwards.
00:40:28.801,00:40:32.430,Father Kristof's report on the Chinese mission will be with lantern slides.
00:40:33.514,00:40:35.433,I'm expected at the Tverskoys'.
00:40:36.393,00:40:37.560,No doubt.
00:40:38.895,00:40:41.439,But I'm sure that Princess Betsy can wait for you.
00:40:49.906,00:40:52.491,"Yes, in fact, I don't think I will go to Betsy's."
00:40:52.533,00:40:53.910,You're caught.
00:40:55.703,00:40:58.497,I'm afraid I'm becoming quite ridiculous.
00:41:30.155,00:41:31.614,"Now, there's a phenomenon."
00:41:31.656,00:41:35.368,"Look, Anna's shadow has arrived before Anna."
00:41:35.410,00:41:37.203,I'm Anna's friend.
00:41:37.245,00:41:41.833,But all this making up one's mind to it in public is not polite to a distinguished man like Karenin.
00:41:41.874,00:41:46.004,"In my opinion, Karenin is a fool and Anna is the best of us."
00:41:46.045,00:41:49.174,"And we all love you for your contrary opinions, Princess."
00:42:05.190,00:42:07.192,"Alexei, you look desperate."
00:42:08.609,00:42:10.736,It's not attractive.
00:42:10.778,00:42:12.238,I'm losing hope.
00:42:12.280,00:42:13.572,Hope of what?
00:42:13.614,00:42:15.741,Persuading a virtuous woman to break her marriage vows?
00:42:17.994,00:42:19.245,"No, you're right."
00:42:21.039,00:42:22.499,She won't come.
00:42:57.033,00:42:58.617,He's gone.
00:42:58.659,00:43:00.619,But you're just in time for the surprise.
00:43:39.784,00:43:42.245,Turn around!
00:43:42.287,00:43:45.664,VRONSKY: May I have the honor of bringing you an ice?
00:43:51.504,00:43:53.631,Ices are being served.
00:43:56.759,00:43:59.345,I would prefer to try a cigarette.
00:44:15.528,00:44:17.280,Courage.
00:44:17.322,00:44:18.656,I'll try another one sometime.
00:44:19.740,00:44:20.699,When?
00:44:21.534,00:44:22.743,Where?
00:44:22.785,00:44:26.122,Just as I was thinking your manners had improved since Moscow.
00:44:26.164,00:44:27.624,You behaved badly.
00:44:27.665,00:44:28.958,Very badly.
00:44:29.000,00:44:30.960,And who was responsible for that?
00:44:34.755,00:44:36.674,Give me a cup of tea.
00:44:42.221,00:44:43.515,How nice!
00:44:43.556,00:44:45.433,Alexei Alexandrovich has arrived.
00:44:47.768,00:44:50.188,I'm not sure my nerves can stand another Alexei at this moment.
00:44:56.944,00:44:58.737,Were you glad to see me or not?
00:44:58.779,00:45:01.366,So the Schuzburgs asked us to dinner.
00:45:01.407,00:45:05.702,"The sauce was said to have cost a thousand rubles, and it was ghastly."
00:45:11.584,00:45:15.338,I gave them a sauce that cost 85 kopeks and it was a triumph.
00:45:16.964,00:45:18.757,This must stop.
00:45:18.799,00:45:20.677,You make me feel as if I were guilty of something.
00:45:20.717,00:45:22.428,What do you want me to do?
00:45:22.470,00:45:24.763,I want you to go to Moscow and beg Kitty to forgive you.
00:45:24.805,00:45:26.432,"No, that's not what you want."
00:45:26.474,00:45:28.767,Moscow?
00:45:28.809,00:45:32.355,Tonight I refused a posting to Tashkent.
00:45:32.397,00:45:34.773,"I can change my mind, and you'll never see me again."
00:45:36.651,00:45:39.028,"If you have any thought for me, you will give me back my peace."
00:45:39.070,00:45:40.779,I have no peace to give.
00:45:40.821,00:45:42.574,There can be no peace for us.
00:45:42.615,00:45:45.618,Only misery or the greatest happiness.
00:45:47.828,00:45:49.788,BETSY: Your husband is impossible.
00:45:49.830,00:45:52.958,"His opinions are all wrong, but he talks so brilliantly, he wins every argument."
00:45:53.000,00:45:54.711,What?
00:45:54.751,00:45:55.836,I called to take you home.
00:45:56.546,00:45:58.381,"No, I'm staying."
00:45:58.423,00:46:00.508,Send the carriage back for me.
00:46:00.550,00:46:01.800,Of course.
00:46:22.779,00:46:25.032,Do you want me to go to Tashkent?
00:46:38.254,00:46:39.838,So I'll go to Tashkent.
00:46:39.880,00:46:40.797,No!
00:46:44.510,00:46:45.886,I don't want you to go.
00:47:15.792,00:47:17.834,KARENIN: I stayed up to talk to you.
00:47:24.342,00:47:25.510,What about?
00:47:26.927,00:47:28.304,It's late.
00:47:29.180,00:47:30.847,Where's Annushka?
00:47:34.101,00:47:35.353,I sent her off.
00:47:38.230,00:47:39.440,Well.
00:47:41.108,00:47:43.277,"If you want to talk, but we should go to bed."
00:47:43.319,00:47:44.737,I must warn you about something.
00:47:44.779,00:47:45.862,Warn me?
00:47:48.533,00:47:49.908,"Oh, it's really rather late."
00:47:49.950,00:47:56.915,"I wish to warn you that you may, inadvertently by indiscretion and carelessness, give the world occasion to talk about you."
00:47:56.957,00:47:58.459,I am not a committee.
00:47:59.752,00:48:01.128,Please say what you want to tell me.
00:48:04.757,00:48:06.759,You and Count Vronsky attracted attention tonight.
00:48:09.345,00:48:12.598,"You don't like it when I don't talk to people, and you don't like it when I do."
00:48:12.640,00:48:15.351,"I didn't notice anything myself, but I saw everyone else noticed."
00:48:16.853,00:48:20.523,I consider jealousy to be insulting to you and degrading to me.
00:48:20.565,00:48:23.025,I have no right to inquire into your feelings.
00:48:23.067,00:48:25.194,They concern only your conscience.
00:48:25.236,00:48:32.618,"But it's my duty to remind you that we are bound together by God, and this bond can only be broken by a crime against God."
00:48:32.660,00:48:34.871,I have nothing to say to you.
00:48:36.163,00:48:37.582,And you have a son.
00:48:37.998,00:48:39.291,And I'm tired.
00:48:50.010,00:48:52.597,"If I am wrong, I ask your pardon."
00:48:55.307,00:48:59.604,"I don't know what you're talking about, and it's really too late for this."
00:49:03.190,00:49:04.525,"Excuse me, please."
00:50:31.487,00:50:33.614,"Oh, God! Oh, forgive me!"
00:50:34.406,00:50:36.074,It's the end of everything.
00:50:36.116,00:50:38.536,"I've got nothing left now except you, remember that."
00:50:40.579,00:50:42.707,How could I not remember?
00:50:44.291,00:50:46.126,You're my happiness.
00:50:51.423,00:50:53.091,Happiness?
00:50:53.133,00:50:55.051,You murdered my happiness.
00:50:56.136,00:50:57.972,Murderer.
00:50:58.014,00:50:59.348,Murderer.
00:51:00.725,00:51:02.100,Go on.
00:51:02.142,00:51:03.310,Yes.
00:51:04.436,00:51:05.938,Go on. Murderer.
00:51:07.147,00:51:08.190,Murderer.
00:51:22.663,00:51:24.790,"OBLONSKY: Look out, here they come."
00:51:27.167,00:51:28.753,"Oh, bad luck."
00:51:38.094,00:51:40.138,Potage aux choux a la russe!
00:51:40.180,00:51:44.142,"OBLONSKY: Agafia, if you opened up in Moscow, the l'Angleterre would go out of business."
00:51:46.645,00:51:48.146,It's true.
00:51:48.188,00:51:50.942,OBLONSKY: Do you want news of Moscow?
00:51:50.983,00:51:52.317,"Oh, you're right, what do you care?"
00:51:52.359,00:51:53.736,"You love the country, you've got it."
00:51:53.778,00:51:56.196,"You love agriculturing, and, Lord knows, you've got that."
00:51:56.238,00:51:57.615,"You love shooting, you've got that."
00:51:57.656,00:51:59.115,You've got everything you want.
00:52:01.077,00:52:02.620,"All right, go on, then."
00:52:02.661,00:52:04.120,Have you stopped stealing bread rolls?
00:52:05.247,00:52:08.000,"Ballet girl, Oriental type."
00:52:09.209,00:52:10.419,How is...
00:52:10.461,00:52:12.170,How are the Shcherbatskys?
00:52:12.212,00:52:13.213,You mean Kitty.
00:52:14.381,00:52:16.174,Is she engaged now?
00:52:16.216,00:52:18.719,Vronsky went back to St. Petersburg.
00:52:19.219,00:52:20.679,Huh.
00:52:20.721,00:52:23.265,Kitty will be seeing Dolly at Ergoshovo in the summer.
00:52:23.933,00:52:25.183,You could...
00:52:25.225,00:52:26.852,"Oh, yes, as if I had time in the summer."
00:52:26.894,00:52:29.354,And I've got extra land at Kashin this year for the haymaking.
00:52:29.396,00:52:31.607,"Kashin? That's on the Ergoshovo road, isn't it?"
00:52:31.649,00:52:33.191,Couldn't you see Kitty when she's there?
00:52:33.233,00:52:35.611,"Especially, not then."
00:52:35.653,00:52:38.030,"Oh, damn you, Kostya."
00:52:39.406,00:52:43.201,"You love Kitty and you can't forgive her because, first, you funked it, and then you bungled it."
00:52:43.243,00:52:48.206,And then you ran away from an 18-year-old girl who was made a fool of by a uniform.
00:52:48.248,00:52:50.084,"It's not you I feel sorry for, it's Kitty."
00:52:50.126,00:52:51.418,Her heart told her no.
00:52:52.837,00:52:55.714,Did you come to shoot snipe or criticize me?
00:53:03.263,00:53:05.307,"Well, don't hold him like a parcel."
00:53:05.349,00:53:08.226,"Oh! It's Aunt Kitty, darling."
00:53:09.770,00:53:13.024,Doesn't he make you ashamed of dwelling on your troubles?
00:53:13.065,00:53:14.817,I have no troubles.
00:53:14.859,00:53:17.235,"That man wasn't worth the tears, believe me."
00:53:17.277,00:53:20.364,I don't care about him.
00:53:21.281,00:53:22.867,Except to hate her.
00:53:23.701,00:53:26.202,Then we'll never speak of it again.
00:53:28.664,00:53:31.207,There are better men waiting for you.
00:53:31.917,00:53:33.293,Stiva says...
00:53:37.339,00:53:40.134,"Kitty, my lamb, did Konstantin..."
00:53:40.176,00:53:42.302,What has Levin got to do with it?
00:53:42.344,00:53:44.346,"Anyway, I'll never get married."
00:53:44.388,00:53:48.266,The whole business of it has become disgusting to me.
00:53:48.308,00:53:50.477,And look what it's done for you.
00:53:53.229,00:53:54.899,Because it's love.
00:54:00.154,00:54:01.363,"ANNA: I want you to, I don't care about it."
00:54:01.405,00:54:02.907,VRONSKY: You should care.
00:54:02.948,00:54:05.325,"Anyway, someone might be watching."
00:54:18.214,00:54:20.382,"But I'm damned, anyway."
00:54:20.424,00:54:22.509,I'm not. I'm blessed.
00:54:25.345,00:54:27.181,You love me.
00:54:27.223,00:54:28.515,Only me.
00:54:31.351,00:54:33.562,Apart from Frou-Frou?
00:54:33.604,00:54:35.689,But me more than your horse?
00:54:35.731,00:54:36.732,Yes.
00:54:39.735,00:54:41.277,Are you happy?
00:54:42.238,00:54:43.279,Yes.
00:54:45.157,00:54:46.575,And you love me?
00:54:46.617,00:54:47.868,Yes.
00:54:49.620,00:54:50.746,How much?
00:54:51.789,00:54:52.957,This much.
00:54:54.750,00:54:55.834,This much?
00:54:56.376,00:54:57.711,Yes.
00:54:57.753,00:54:59.546,This much?
00:54:59.588,00:55:00.798,And this much?
00:55:01.381,00:55:02.758,Yes.
00:55:02.800,00:55:03.926,This much?
00:55:05.385,00:55:07.554,This much?
00:55:25.114,00:55:26.991,"So, this is love."
00:55:28.324,00:55:29.618,This.
00:55:34.414,00:55:35.331,Countess.
00:55:37.709,00:55:39.962,I thought you would be at Peterhof now.
00:55:40.004,00:55:41.421,I've come from there.
00:55:41.463,00:55:44.382,I'm distressed that you haven't taken your usual house this year.
00:55:44.424,00:55:46.885,Anna wanted a change.
00:55:46.927,00:55:49.888,Nearer to Princess Betsy at Tsarskoe Selo.
00:55:52.308,00:55:54.518,The guards are in summer camp at Tsarskoe.
00:55:55.894,00:56:00.858,"Alexei Alexandrovich, forgive me, but..."
00:56:02.442,00:56:04.695,You are too tolerant.
00:56:04.736,00:56:07.072,Oh! Is this about my wife?
00:56:07.114,00:56:09.283,My wife is beyond reproach.
00:56:10.034,00:56:12.244,"She is, after all, my wife."
00:56:25.299,00:56:27.051,Alyosha! Alyosha!
00:56:30.179,00:56:31.805,A message from Maman.
00:56:31.847,00:56:36.434,Her friend Princess Sorokina has a house here and a virgin daughter.
00:56:36.476,00:56:41.606,"Well, that's not part of the message, but they'll all be at the races and you're expected to supper afterwards."
00:56:41.648,00:56:44.442,Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
00:56:44.484,00:56:46.904,I give you the regiment!
00:56:47.696,00:56:49.447,ALL: The regiment!
00:56:54.370,00:56:56.330,I heard you turned down a promotion.
00:56:56.372,00:56:58.456,That was Maman interfering.
00:56:58.498,00:56:59.624,Yes.
00:56:59.666,00:57:01.459,And now she's come up with a princess for you.
00:57:04.171,00:57:07.925,"Alexei, we're brothers, so don't take offense."
00:57:07.966,00:57:10.719,Getting married puts the pack on your back.
00:57:10.761,00:57:13.471,It leaves your hands free for climbing the ladder.
00:57:15.515,00:57:19.061,Getting serious about a married woman is like carrying your pack in your arms.
00:57:19.103,00:57:20.687,"So, they talk about me."
00:57:23.523,00:57:25.401,"I'm leaving, Sasha."
00:57:26.526,00:57:28.195,An assignation?
00:57:28.237,00:57:30.072,"Come on, I'll introduce you."
00:57:33.533,00:57:34.993,Beautiful.
00:57:36.036,00:57:38.330,A man would come to no harm.
00:57:41.125,00:57:43.377,FERGUSON: Do you think you'll win tomorrow?
00:57:43.419,00:57:45.003,VRONSKY: Makhotin's Gladiator is favorite.
00:57:45.587,00:57:47.505,Sixteen hands.
00:57:47.547,00:57:49.049,Frou-Frou looks dainty beside him.
00:57:50.008,00:57:52.094,But she's got heart.
00:57:52.136,00:57:53.470,"Haven't you, my darling?"
00:58:09.987,00:58:11.155,Anna.
00:58:13.490,00:58:14.741,Alexei!
00:58:15.451,00:58:17.411,What is it?
00:58:17.453,00:58:20.164,I couldn't bear not to see you before the race.
00:58:27.379,00:58:29.506,What were you thinking about?
00:58:33.593,00:58:35.053,Tell me.
00:58:37.306,00:58:38.682,I'm pregnant.
00:58:40.851,00:58:42.394,"Oh, my love."
00:58:45.397,00:58:47.649,"Well, love was never a game to us."
00:58:47.691,00:58:52.029,"Here's an end to living in corners, existing day to day on lies."
00:58:54.531,00:58:56.450,Now we can be together.
00:58:57.284,00:58:59.203,"How can we, Alexei?"
00:58:59.244,00:59:01.372,Tell Karenin everything.
00:59:01.413,00:59:03.374,Do you think my husband will make you a present of me?
00:59:03.415,00:59:04.582,Leave him.
00:59:04.624,00:59:05.959,Leave him and be your mistress?
00:59:06.001,00:59:07.585,"Yes, run away."
00:59:10.881,00:59:13.217,I would never see my son again.
00:59:14.301,00:59:16.011,The laws are made by husbands and fathers.
00:59:16.053,00:59:17.513,"What, then?"
00:59:18.930,00:59:21.558,I'll never forgive myself for your unhappiness.
00:59:22.017,00:59:24.602,Unhappiness?
00:59:24.644,00:59:27.022,I'm like a starving beggar who's been given food.
00:59:27.856,00:59:29.274,"I, unhappy?"
00:59:31.026,00:59:32.236,No.
00:59:34.321,00:59:36.240,This is my happiness.
00:59:38.658,00:59:40.369,ANNA: Serozha!
00:59:42.246,00:59:43.914,"Serozha, I'm coming to get you!"
00:59:49.127,00:59:50.587,Where are you?
00:59:52.672,00:59:54.091,Serozha!
00:59:56.051,00:59:57.594,Where are you?
00:59:59.263,01:00:01.723,"How are you, young man?"
01:00:01.765,01:00:03.559,Your tutor doesn't seem to be in evidence.
01:00:03.600,01:00:04.642,Yah!
01:00:08.855,01:00:10.648,Alexei.
01:00:10.690,01:00:12.734,You got away at last.
01:00:13.277,01:00:14.611,Why?
01:00:16.572,01:00:18.615,Go and find Vasily Lukich.
01:00:20.284,01:00:21.535,I have to change.
01:00:21.577,01:00:23.454,Princess Betsy is sending her trap for me.
01:00:23.495,01:00:26.498,Would you like to come?
01:00:26.540,01:00:28.250,"Races, surely."
01:00:28.292,01:00:31.628,"No, I'll come on later."
01:01:07.247,01:01:08.665,Yes!
01:01:21.428,01:01:22.720,OBLONSKY: Princess! Princess!
01:01:22.762,01:01:24.681,A bet!
01:01:25.265,01:01:26.724,Kusolev.
01:01:26.766,01:01:28.644,I'm on Vronsky.
01:01:35.275,01:01:37.194,Alexander Vronsky.
01:01:49.956,01:01:52.000,You are an exquisite creature.
01:01:52.042,01:01:54.336,You really ought to be the spoils of victory today.
01:02:41.675,01:02:42.926,Yah! Yah!
01:02:47.889,01:02:49.766,"Go, Frou-Frou! Go!"
01:02:56.314,01:02:57.441,Go!
01:03:03.780,01:03:05.657,"Go, Frou-Frou! Go!"
01:03:10.870,01:03:12.664,Alexei!
01:03:19.045,01:03:20.464,I'm here.
01:03:30.890,01:03:31.891,I'm here.
01:03:35.895,01:03:36.854,Get up!
01:03:38.898,01:03:40.066,Get up!
01:03:42.902,01:03:43.987,Her back is broken.
01:04:02.172,01:04:03.757,You know...
01:04:07.844,01:04:10.847,They say the Emperor disapproves of the races.
01:04:11.598,01:04:12.890,The danger of injury.
01:04:12.932,01:04:14.058,But I...
01:04:14.100,01:04:15.310,What?
01:04:17.020,01:04:21.858,"I'm saying I think there's a value in manly sport, for the military."
01:04:23.568,01:04:24.861,I don't understand.
01:04:26.237,01:04:31.493,"In my opinion, it's not the sport itself."
01:04:31.535,01:04:33.495,It's making a cruel spectacle out of...
01:04:33.537,01:04:35.372,What are you talking about?
01:04:38.333,01:04:39.959,I have to tell you...
01:04:40.001,01:04:43.338,"I have to tell you, you behaved improperly today."
01:04:44.673,01:04:45.882,How is that?
01:04:48.343,01:04:52.096,By making plain your feeling when one of the riders fell.
01:04:52.138,01:04:55.099,Your conduct was improper.
01:04:55.141,01:04:58.645,It must not occur again.
01:05:01.565,01:05:04.818,You will say my concern is unnecessary and ridiculous.
01:05:04.860,01:05:06.403,You are my wife.
01:05:07.571,01:05:09.614,I'm wrong to think that.
01:05:11.991,01:05:12.992,Yes?
01:05:13.993,01:05:15.537,Perhaps I was mistaken...
01:05:15.579,01:05:16.913,No.
01:05:17.997,01:05:19.916,You were not mistaken.
01:05:23.378,01:05:24.921,I love him.
01:05:27.090,01:05:28.925,I am his mistress.
01:05:33.012,01:05:34.890,Do what you like to me.
01:05:49.028,01:05:50.614,"Wait. Please, move away."
01:05:56.703,01:06:00.998,I will not have a scandal.
01:06:01.040,01:06:06.922,You will behave in a way that nothing is known against you by society or by the servants.
01:06:06.963,01:06:12.009,"In return, you will keep the privileges of a wife, and the duties."
01:06:12.051,01:06:14.971,Tomorrow you will return home.
01:06:47.462,01:06:49.005,Are you hurt?
01:06:52.801,01:06:54.344,What's happened?
01:06:55.261,01:06:58.348,I told him I'm your mistress.
01:06:58.389,01:07:00.141,He thinks I can give you up and go on living.
01:07:00.183,01:07:02.018,No. You cannot.
01:07:49.065,01:07:50.316,Time for bed?
01:08:01.036,01:08:03.997,It was pleasant to hear you being congratulated on your husband.
01:08:05.164,01:08:07.124,"Not that I care for decorations, but..."
01:08:07.166,01:08:08.960,"Alexei, I can't. I'm sorry."
01:08:10.086,01:08:11.087,Oh.
01:08:12.171,01:08:14.090,"But I'm his wife, now."
01:08:20.764,01:08:22.557,I'm having his child.
01:08:56.299,01:08:59.052,Tell me what I did to deserve this.
01:09:29.040,01:09:30.083,Halt!
01:09:53.648,01:09:55.733,"How many mowers is it, Theodore?"
01:09:58.653,01:10:02.406,"In your father's time, it was work for two days for 30 men."
01:10:02.448,01:10:04.200,Though he never picked up a scythe himself.
01:10:05.869,01:10:08.245,The men don't like me for it.
01:10:08.287,01:10:10.623,They like what they're used to.
01:10:10.665,01:10:12.249,It settles me.
01:10:12.291,01:10:14.251,"How is that, Master?"
01:10:14.293,01:10:17.130,"When I'm mowing, I don't ask myself why I'm here."
01:10:17.172,01:10:19.841,You're here to be Master Konstantin Dmitrievich.
01:10:19.883,01:10:22.301,"As it's always been, by the grace of God."
01:10:22.343,01:10:25.262,"My father owned you, Theodore."
01:10:25.304,01:10:28.058,Owned you like chattels to be bought and sold.
01:10:28.099,01:10:29.517,Was that by the grace of God?
01:10:31.310,01:10:33.270,It was.
01:10:33.312,01:10:36.273,"That's my youngest you were looking at, there."
01:10:36.315,01:10:41.196,His young life is perilous now since the freedom came and work must be found.
01:10:41.237,01:10:43.031,They look happier than I've ever been.
01:10:46.159,01:10:48.912,Is it living simply that I'm looking for?
01:12:25.424,01:12:26.926,I'm expected.
01:12:30.429,01:12:31.597,No.
01:12:32.807,01:12:34.934,I will not live like this.
01:12:36.435,01:12:40.857,"This waiting for hour after hour, not knowing when I'll ever see you again."
01:12:41.607,01:12:42.859,Sorry.
01:12:43.943,01:12:45.778,It's my demon.
01:12:45.820,01:12:47.238,You wrote that you were ill.
01:12:47.280,01:12:48.405,"Don't worry, it won't be for long."
01:12:48.447,01:12:49.991,Stop.
01:12:50.033,01:12:51.408,I was told it in a dream.
01:12:51.450,01:12:52.702,There.
01:12:52.743,01:12:54.411,"Yes, and I'm only going to die having your baby."
01:12:54.453,01:12:57.040,That's all nonsense.
01:12:57.707,01:12:59.375,Tell me it is.
01:13:01.460,01:13:02.920,"You love me, only me."
01:13:02.962,01:13:06.007,Your note said your husband would be out.
01:13:06.049,01:13:08.384,He was late.
01:13:11.554,01:13:13.430,And you...
01:13:13.472,01:13:15.308,Why do you call him my husband?
01:13:15.350,01:13:16.726,"He isn't my husband, he's a clock."
01:13:16.767,01:13:19.729,But it was awkward. My honor.
01:13:19.770,01:13:22.815,Do you think of your honor when you're sharing whores with your Colonel?
01:13:22.857,01:13:24.483,Your demon again?
01:13:25.985,01:13:28.238,I'll be glad to die before you start to hate me.
01:13:28.279,01:13:29.405,Anna.
01:13:31.490,01:13:33.159,Put your hand there.
01:13:34.535,01:13:36.620,You can feel him move.
01:13:38.497,01:13:50.801,"I respectfully ask Minister Karenin whether his proposals for the regulation of these colorful gypsy tribes of these scholarly, God-fearing Jews, and of..."
01:13:52.095,01:13:55.472,But I'm afraid I've lost the Minister's attention.
01:13:58.017,01:13:59.185,Who is here?
01:13:59.227,01:14:00.937,"Only Madame, Your Excellency."
01:14:07.318,01:14:08.861,I wanted to see him because...
01:14:08.903,01:14:12.448,I do not wish to know why a woman wants to see her lover.
01:14:13.324,01:14:14.658,What are you doing?
01:14:14.700,01:14:16.244,I want his letters!
01:14:21.916,01:14:30.383,"I am going to Moscow tomorrow, and then the provinces with a commission to investigate conditions among the Jews and gypsies, whose conditions I infinitely prefer to my own."
01:14:30.425,01:14:34.678,I will not return to this house until divorce has driven you into the street.
01:14:34.720,01:14:37.307,"Meanwhile, my son will be sent to live with my eldest sister."
01:14:37.348,01:14:40.017,"No, Alexei, please."
01:14:40.059,01:14:42.312,Do you think I would let you have my son?
01:14:42.353,01:14:44.521,You are depraved.
01:14:44.563,01:14:47.483,I thank God the curse of love is lifted from me.
01:15:05.168,01:15:06.836,I need your advice.
01:15:14.260,01:15:16.262,"Come on, come on!"
01:15:20.683,01:15:22.935,"Right, after you, after you."
01:15:22.977,01:15:24.728,Are we late?
01:15:24.770,01:15:27.023,I'm Countess Nordston.
01:15:27.064,01:15:29.817,We nearly met at the Shcherbatskys' last winter.
01:15:29.859,01:15:31.568,PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY: Come into the fold.
01:15:31.610,01:15:32.820,Come on.
01:15:35.614,01:15:38.534,You've been waiting for me.
01:15:40.619,01:15:42.079,Kitty is here.
01:15:45.333,01:15:49.170,"Konstantin, what a long time since we saw each other."
01:15:49.212,01:15:51.839,"Since you saw me, but I saw you not so long ago."
01:15:52.256,01:15:53.674,When?
01:15:53.716,01:15:55.301,You were driving to Ergoshovo.
01:15:55.343,01:15:56.760,I was at Kashin for the haymaking.
01:15:56.802,01:15:58.012,"Oh, but why didn't you..."
01:15:58.054,01:15:59.596,I'm so glad to see you.
01:16:00.639,01:16:02.350,You're just the same.
01:16:04.727,01:16:06.103,I hope not.
01:16:07.230,01:16:09.606,I was young and silly in those days.
01:16:09.648,01:16:11.025,Months and months ago.
01:16:15.029,01:16:16.531,And you haven't changed.
01:16:18.657,01:16:20.659,No. I haven't.
01:16:26.040,01:16:31.212,"Permit me to announce, um, soup Marie-Louise carp with asparagus and roast beef."
01:16:31.254,01:16:33.256,I went to the market in person.
01:16:36.384,01:16:37.843,An extra place.
01:16:40.179,01:16:43.599,I've come to tell you our connection must be severed.
01:16:44.600,01:16:46.060,I'm going to divorce your sister.
01:16:47.562,01:16:48.645,Divorce?
01:16:50.689,01:16:54.444,"Oh, dear me, what are you Well, don't be in a hurry."
01:16:54.485,01:16:55.652,"And later, you can talk it over with Dolly."
01:16:55.694,01:16:57.654,"Prince Oblonsky, everything is over between our families."
01:16:57.696,01:17:01.325,"Alexei, divorce is one thing."
01:17:01.367,01:17:08.082,"PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY: You Petersburgers think yourselves so de bon ton compared with dull, old-fashioned Moscow."
01:17:08.124,01:17:10.460,But we know how to do things.
01:17:10.501,01:17:14.671,"Only the other day, I hear Vasya Pryachnikov fought a duel with Kvitsky and killed him."
01:17:14.713,01:17:15.672,"Well, what..."
01:17:15.714,01:17:17.508,What was the challenge about?
01:17:17.550,01:17:19.135,"Pryachnikov's wife, naturally."
01:17:19.176,01:17:20.886,"PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY: It was a matter of honor, defending a woman's honor."
01:17:20.928,01:17:24.681,Sounds like barbarism to me.
01:17:24.723,01:17:27.351,"Would that have preserved the wife's honor, too?"
01:17:27.393,01:17:30.062,"Still, not many of us can say our lover died for love."
01:17:30.104,01:17:31.606,Love?
01:17:31.647,01:17:34.567,Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's wife.
01:17:43.993,01:17:47.580,"Would you die for love, Konstantin Dmitrievich?"
01:17:47.622,01:17:49.873,I would. But not for my neighbor's wife.
01:17:53.752,01:17:56.797,An impure love is not love to me.
01:17:56.839,01:18:11.687,"To admire another man's wife is a pleasant thing, but sensual desire indulged for its own sake is greed, a kind of gluttony, and a misuse of something sacred, which is given to us so that we may choose the one person with whom to fulfill our humanness."
01:18:14.940,01:18:16.733,"Otherwise, we might as well be cattle."
01:18:16.775,01:18:18.277,Ah! An idealist!
01:18:24.825,01:18:27.744,But she will be nobody's wife.
01:18:27.786,01:18:28.829,She'll be ruined.
01:18:29.955,01:18:32.708,I tried to save her.
01:18:33.292,01:18:34.710,Alexei Alexandrovich.
01:18:35.169,01:18:36.379,Look at me.
01:18:38.673,01:18:42.009,You will have no peace of mind until you forgive her.
01:18:43.678,01:18:45.762,It was Anna who taught me that.
01:18:45.804,01:18:47.223,I do not wish to forgive.
01:18:47.264,01:18:49.183,I'm not a cruel man.
01:18:49.225,01:18:51.768,I've never hated anyone.
01:18:51.810,01:18:55.981,But I hate her with all my soul for all the wrong she has done me.
01:18:57.816,01:19:00.653,"OBLONSKY: Now, it is your turn to play us something, Countess."
01:19:00.695,01:19:02.779,COUNTESS NORDSTON: I thought you'd never ask.
01:19:02.821,01:19:04.198,Very good.
01:19:06.409,01:19:11.664,"Since we last met, there is something I have often wanted to ask you."
01:19:11.706,01:19:13.123,What is that?
01:19:23.842,01:19:25.135,LEVIN: This.
01:19:28.347,01:19:29.765,Do...
01:19:30.641,01:19:31.726,Not...
01:19:37.690,01:19:38.815,Did.
01:19:41.485,01:19:42.695,Did not.
01:19:55.040,01:19:57.084,The last word is never.
01:21:08.113,01:21:09.657,I know what it says.
01:21:33.972,01:21:34.890,Then.
01:21:38.352,01:21:39.645,But now?
01:21:47.986,01:21:52.867,Can you forgive and forget?
01:22:09.800,01:22:11.301,I never stopped.
01:23:34.885,01:23:36.595,Why doesn't he come?
01:23:37.888,01:23:40.933,He is kind.
01:23:43.978,01:23:45.145,Her fever is higher.
01:23:45.187,01:23:48.106,I want Alexei.
01:23:48.148,01:23:50.567,Give me some water.
01:23:50.609,01:23:52.110,It isn't good for my little girl.
01:23:52.152,01:23:54.571,"Or let her have a nurse, yes."
01:23:54.613,01:23:59.326,Don't bring her here because Alexei is coming and it will hurt him to see her.
01:23:59.368,01:24:02.078,"He's come, my dear."
01:24:02.120,01:24:04.665,DOCTOR: Her deliverance is still in God's hands.
01:24:04.707,01:24:08.126,ANNA: You think he won't forgive me but you don't know him.
01:24:09.127,01:24:11.964,No one knows him except me.
01:24:12.006,01:24:14.049,"I'm not afraid of him, now."
01:24:16.426,01:24:18.303,"I'm afraid of death, though."
01:24:21.306,01:24:22.391,Oh.
01:24:28.814,01:24:30.148,You poor man.
01:24:34.152,01:24:36.030,Let him come closer.
01:24:38.156,01:24:39.324,Alexei.
01:24:42.828,01:24:44.079,Alexei.
01:24:58.635,01:25:00.095,Look at my husband.
01:25:01.179,01:25:02.598,He's a saint.
01:25:03.640,01:25:05.100,Take his hand.
01:25:21.491,01:25:22.910,Thank God.
01:25:24.828,01:25:25.913,Thank God.
01:25:43.013,01:25:45.474,You must leave now.
01:25:45.515,01:25:48.518,I promise to send for you if she asks for you.
01:25:50.020,01:25:52.355,I don't know what happened to me.
01:25:52.397,01:25:55.400,I forgive you.
01:25:58.153,01:26:00.155,My soul is filled with joy.
01:26:02.032,01:26:05.160,I will remain with her and look after her forever.
01:26:10.707,01:26:12.042,Come now.
01:26:19.341,01:26:20.676,Come now.
01:26:21.510,01:26:23.679,Look at you.
01:26:23.720,01:26:26.932,You look like what you've become.
01:26:28.266,01:26:30.310,I fancy you will be asked to leave the regiment.
01:26:30.352,01:26:32.021,"I would like you to go, Maman."
01:26:32.062,01:26:34.230,I'll go when I'm ready to go.
01:26:34.272,01:26:38.276,A little affair with a married woman puts a finishing touch to a young man's education.
01:26:38.318,01:26:40.946,"But this morbid, selfish obsession..."
01:26:40.988,01:26:44.199,You've publicly humiliated yourself and dishonored a man who has devoted his life to Russia.
01:26:45.283,01:26:48.328,So you'd better come back to Moscow with me.
01:26:48.370,01:26:50.205,You're finished here.
01:27:10.767,01:27:14.855,"And there was her husband, wearing her best ball gown."
01:27:14.897,01:27:17.107,Rouge all over his face.
01:27:18.567,01:27:20.402,"Ma chere, le scandale!"
01:27:22.696,01:27:25.949,But I'd better tell you some regimental news.
01:27:25.991,01:27:27.576,Who is here?
01:27:27.617,01:27:31.246,"FOOTMAN: Princess Elisabeth Federovna Tverskaya, Your Excellency."
01:27:32.206,01:27:34.166,ANNA: I don't want to see him.
01:27:34.208,01:27:36.835,But surely your husband wouldn't stop...
01:27:37.836,01:27:39.295,BETSY: I'm so glad to see you.
01:27:39.337,01:27:40.338,You look feverish.
01:27:40.380,01:27:42.465,"We've been talking too much, so I'm going."
01:27:42.507,01:27:44.426,Princess Betsy came to tell me...
01:27:45.594,01:27:47.888,I don't want to hide anything from you.
01:27:47.930,01:27:51.266,Count Vronsky asked to come to say goodbye.
01:27:54.269,01:27:56.813,I've told him that I can't receive him.
01:27:59.608,01:28:01.276,"Well, goodbye, my treasure."
01:28:24.382,01:28:26.135,I agree with you.
01:28:26.176,01:28:28.595,"As he is going away, there's no need for Count Vronsky to come."
01:28:28.637,01:28:30.639,"I just said so, so there's no need to repeat it."
01:28:30.680,01:28:32.141,But it is for you to decide.
01:28:32.182,01:28:34.350,"Yes, and I decided."
01:28:34.392,01:28:35.852,Then I am very glad that...
01:28:35.894,01:28:38.354,"That we agree, so perhaps we can stop talking about it."
01:28:38.396,01:28:41.357,Of course.
01:28:41.399,01:28:46.196,"Yes, can you please, please, please stop cracking your knuckles?"
01:28:51.660,01:28:53.328,I'm a bad woman.
01:28:56.498,01:28:58.333,But I can't breathe.
01:29:00.127,01:29:02.545,"Your kindness, which I can't repay, and your forgiveness..."
01:29:02.587,01:29:05.465,You begged me for my forgiveness.
01:29:05.507,01:29:07.301,"But I didn't die, and now I have to live with it."
01:29:07.342,01:29:10.179,Then what? What do you want?
01:29:10.220,01:29:13.431,Do you know what you want?
01:29:13.473,01:29:15.642,Not to say goodbye.
01:29:19.313,01:29:20.605,I can't hear.
01:29:21.523,01:29:23.358,Not to say goodbye.
01:29:26.236,01:29:30.240,You would be lost.
01:29:30.907,01:29:32.909,You would have no position.
01:29:32.951,01:29:36.412,"And worse, if we divorce, you would be the guilty party."
01:29:36.454,01:29:39.208,That means you cannot legally remarry.
01:29:39.249,01:29:45.421,"Your union with Count Vronsky would be illegitimate, as would your daughter, who now has the protection of my name."
01:29:45.463,01:29:47.381,And this is what you want?
01:29:49.301,01:29:52.721,It would be a sin to help you destroy yourself.
01:29:52.762,01:29:54.514,You forget something.
01:29:55.974,01:29:59.644,Count Vronsky and I love each other.
01:30:00.979,01:30:05.108,And this love sanctifies a criminal folly?
01:30:05.150,01:30:09.445,All I know is that I sent him away and it's as if I'd shot myself through the heart!
01:30:13.491,01:30:14.993,I see.
01:30:19.289,01:30:20.957,And what of Serozha?
01:30:23.501,01:30:28.757,"I would die for him, but I won't live like this for him."
01:30:30.508,01:30:33.427,"When he knows of love, he will forgive me."
01:30:37.515,01:30:40.643,Then I must choose the smaller sin.
01:30:40.685,01:30:44.731,Vronsky has robbed me of my cloak and I will give him my coat.
01:30:44.773,01:30:46.108,"No, I..."
01:31:13.969,01:31:16.221,My darling. My darling.
01:31:19.015,01:31:20.183,You look so pale.
01:31:20.225,01:31:21.643,"Oh, my darling."
01:31:23.353,01:31:26.148,We'll go south to the sea air and sunshine.
01:32:31.629,01:32:34.548,Is it all right?
01:32:35.633,01:32:37.593,I want to see everything.
01:32:41.348,01:32:42.556,A moment.
01:32:45.435,01:32:50.606,And now I'm doing kitchenmaid's work because Nadya's parents won't let her set foot in the house.
01:32:50.648,01:32:53.318,And who can blame them?
01:33:32.274,01:33:33.900,It's Konstantin.
01:33:35.735,01:33:36.903,"Yes, good."
01:33:37.779,01:33:39.906,The doctor here is useless.
01:33:40.782,01:33:42.658,Get me one from Moscow.
01:33:44.327,01:33:45.870,Where did you go?
01:33:47.705,01:33:51.000,I asked for you everywhere when I was getting married.
01:33:59.134,01:34:01.844,I'm sorry.
01:34:01.886,01:34:04.598,Yes. My wife...
01:34:06.516,01:34:08.143,You can't stay now.
01:34:12.355,01:34:15.400,I will nurse him with Agafia.
01:34:15.442,01:34:17.486,The woman will find somewhere in the village.
01:34:17.527,01:34:19.862,You won't see her.
01:34:19.904,01:34:23.741,She knows it is impossible to meet you.
01:34:23.783,01:34:29.998,It is a torment to me that I've brought you under the same roof as this unfortunate...
01:34:30.039,01:34:32.708,"And in your precious, delicate condition."
01:34:34.586,01:34:35.795,"Oh, Kostya."
01:34:38.923,01:34:41.717,Good. A clean nightshirt and sheets.
01:34:41.759,01:34:44.387,A towel and a clean pail of warm water.
01:34:44.971,01:34:46.014,Wait.
01:34:51.353,01:34:55.689,"And bring the perfume bottle, in the outside pocket of my handbag."
01:36:12.850,01:36:16.854,"MAN: Twenty-one to Stremov, four to Karenin."
01:36:36.332,01:36:38.460,"Alexei, they're back."
01:36:39.252,01:36:41.254,"Here, in St. Petersburg."
01:36:41.879,01:36:43.506,She has written to me.
01:36:44.340,01:36:45.467,To you?
01:36:56.894,01:36:59.773,They think I don't have the right to refuse.
01:37:00.482,01:37:01.691,It's the boy's birthday.
01:37:02.275,01:37:09.823,"My friend, you would be blowing on the embers of a fire which must be allowed to die."
01:37:12.285,01:37:13.827,Let me write to her.
01:37:58.956,01:38:00.874,I'm here to see Serozha.
01:38:03.127,01:38:04.337,Madame?
01:38:08.675,01:38:10.968,"I beg your pardon, Your Excellency."
01:38:15.682,01:38:17.851,"No, I've come to see Serozha."
01:38:38.413,01:38:39.748,Maman?
01:38:39.789,01:38:40.832,Oh.
01:38:41.374,01:38:42.834,My dear little boy.
01:38:42.876,01:38:44.711,I knew you would come.
01:38:45.378,01:38:46.755,Today is my birthday.
01:38:46.796,01:38:48.172,I know.
01:38:49.006,01:38:50.759,Are you crying?
01:38:50.800,01:38:52.677,"No, I won't cry."
01:38:52.719,01:38:53.969,"SEROZHA: Where did you go, Maman?"
01:38:54.011,01:38:55.971,ANNA: I don't know.
01:38:56.013,01:38:57.931,Everywhere. The south.
01:38:59.392,01:39:02.353,I thought about you every day.
01:39:02.395,01:39:05.189,SEROZHA: And I thought about you every day.
01:39:07.817,01:39:10.361,And you must love Papa.
01:39:10.403,01:39:13.322,No one in the whole world is better than you.
01:39:31.549,01:39:32.634,No.
01:40:07.669,01:40:09.044,Where's Anya?
01:40:09.086,01:40:10.755,She's still asleep.
01:40:12.256,01:40:14.175,Should I take your coat?
01:40:17.553,01:40:19.514,"Are you feeling unwell, madam?"
01:40:19.555,01:40:21.891,I'm not sleeping.
01:40:21.933,01:40:24.017,I can send out for something.
01:40:24.769,01:40:25.895,Yes.
01:40:48.125,01:40:50.378,Why are you in the dark?
01:40:50.419,01:40:53.673,Yashvin is going to call.
01:40:53.715,01:40:54.757,Are you going out?
01:40:55.216,01:40:56.592,To where?
01:40:57.844,01:40:59.261,To whom?
01:40:59.303,01:41:01.054,What's the matter?
01:41:02.139,01:41:03.391,I didn't know what happened to you.
01:41:03.432,01:41:05.100,But I told you yesterday. My brother.
01:41:05.142,01:41:08.103,Does it take all day to meet your brother?
01:41:08.145,01:41:10.105,Does he need you more than I do?
01:41:10.606,01:41:12.065,What's happened?
01:41:16.195,01:41:18.489,"Well, Alexander agreed to everything."
01:41:18.531,01:41:23.160,"Mother's house in Moscow will go to him, and the country estate will be our new home."
01:41:26.163,01:41:28.041,As soon as the divorce.
01:41:29.375,01:41:32.085,Karenin hasn't answered your letter yet?
01:41:36.966,01:41:39.301,You're the very first person to call on me since our return.
01:41:39.343,01:41:44.724,I received a note from Princess Betsy asking me to call on her between 6:30 and 8:00.
01:41:44.766,01:41:46.726,Or was it 7:00?
01:41:46.768,01:41:49.228,But perhaps you'll meet at the opera tonight.
01:41:49.270,01:41:51.522,I would love to be there if I could get a box.
01:41:51.564,01:41:53.733,"Madame, your box is number four."
01:41:53.775,01:41:56.151,You'll find me there with Princess Myagkaya.
01:41:57.236,01:41:58.362,"Will you come, Vronsky?"
01:42:02.784,01:42:05.494,Well...
01:42:13.086,01:42:14.670,You know you can't go to the theater.
01:42:14.712,01:42:16.464,Annushka!
01:42:16.505,01:42:18.007,A bath! I'll come in and choose a dress.
01:42:18.049,01:42:19.174,"Anna, I implore you."
01:42:19.216,01:42:21.552,I'm not ashamed of who I am or what I've done.
01:42:21.594,01:42:23.429,Are you ashamed for me?
01:42:23.471,01:42:26.181,Why don't you book a room at the hotel?
01:42:26.223,01:42:28.017,Aren't we together?
01:42:28.726,01:42:29.852,Have you changed towards me?
01:42:29.894,01:42:31.353,It's because I love you and care about you.
01:42:31.395,01:42:33.188,"If that's the case, then I don't know why you aren't coming with me."
01:42:33.230,01:42:34.273,That would make it worse.
01:42:34.315,01:42:35.942,You're afraid.
01:42:36.233,01:42:37.860,"Well, I'm not."
01:43:16.649,01:43:18.860,"Should we visit, or stay put?"
01:43:19.360,01:43:20.695,Stay put.
01:43:23.280,01:43:25.741,Minister! Congratulations.
01:43:26.325,01:43:28.201,Come in for a moment.
01:43:47.805,01:43:50.183,PRINCESS MYAGKAYA: Princess Sorokina and her daughter.
01:43:50.223,01:43:53.644,"They're from Moscow, neighbors of Count Vronsky's mother."
01:43:53.686,01:43:57.148,Quite well off. No sons.
01:43:59.316,01:44:01.318,"My dear, I'm a sales catalog."
01:44:09.744,01:44:10.995,Alexei.
01:44:13.539,01:44:16.458,You'll come up to see us afterwards?
01:44:16.500,01:44:18.251,I'll talk to Varya.
01:44:22.339,01:44:23.883,Will you call on Anna?
01:44:23.925,01:44:27.302,Oh. Alexei. I'm fond of...
01:44:27.344,01:44:28.387,For God's sake!
01:44:30.932,01:44:32.016,Anna isn't a criminal.
01:44:32.058,01:44:34.977,I'd call on her if she'd only broken the law.
01:44:35.644,01:44:37.605,But she broke the rules.
01:44:53.037,01:44:56.415,PRINCESS MYAGKAYA: Who has made the decor?
01:44:56.457,01:44:58.209,"Colonel, would you be so kind?"
01:44:58.251,01:44:59.334,YASHVIN: Of course.
01:44:59.376,01:45:03.131,"Please, I would be honored if you would take mine."
01:45:03.172,01:45:04.966,Thank you. How very...
01:45:07.593,01:45:08.636,It's a disgrace.
01:45:08.677,01:45:10.179,"Hush, dear."
01:45:15.017,01:45:16.727,Everyone's looking.
01:45:16.769,01:45:19.563,Let them look!
01:45:20.397,01:45:22.441,What are we coming to?
01:45:22.483,01:45:25.402,It's an insult to decency.
01:45:25.444,01:45:29.198,"Hush. I beg you, my dear."
01:45:29.240,01:45:33.535,I have a word or two for some people one didn't expect to be rubbing shoulders with.
01:45:33.577,01:45:37.248,"She has a nerve, flaunting herself like a slut in society."
01:45:41.418,01:45:42.878,"Yes, why don't you?"
01:45:42.920,01:45:45.338,Rescue her and put your seal on the fiasco.
01:46:00.855,01:46:05.484,"BETSY: Alexei, you see why she must divorce."
01:46:05.526,01:46:09.030,Marriage will solve everything.
01:46:09.071,01:46:11.199,"As far as I'm concerned, she's my wife."
01:46:11.240,01:46:13.242,"As you saw, she isn't."
01:46:15.452,01:46:17.579,"We're going to Moscow, then to my place in the country."
01:46:17.621,01:46:19.414,That sounds like a good idea.
01:46:19.456,01:46:20.916,"But, for a day or two, Anna will be at home."
01:46:23.460,01:46:24.377,Then...
01:46:26.339,01:46:28.090,I'll say goodbye now.
01:46:47.860,01:46:50.279,"Well, you had an excellent night."
01:46:52.323,01:46:54.783,Does your mother want you to marry the widow or the child?
01:46:55.659,01:46:57.912,Either one.
01:46:57.953,01:47:01.707,"If you loved me, you would have locked me in to stop me going!"
01:47:17.598,01:47:19.432,"Yes, it was my fault."
01:47:32.947,01:47:34.447,I won't sleep.
01:47:38.535,01:47:40.453,I know how to make you sleep.
01:48:35.426,01:48:38.929,"Anna, I am very glad to see you."
01:48:38.971,01:48:41.390,Are you well?
01:48:43.184,01:48:47.938,"Stiva wanted to invite you and Count Vronsky to the house, but it's impossible."
01:48:47.980,01:48:49.564,"No, I understand."
01:48:49.606,01:48:51.524,"No. No, you don't."
01:48:52.443,01:48:54.611,Kitty and her husband are with us.
01:48:54.653,01:48:56.571,She's in Moscow to have the baby.
01:48:56.613,01:49:00.575,Kitty! Tell her how pleased I am.
01:49:00.617,01:49:02.786,Perhaps I'll wait a year or two.
01:49:04.705,01:49:05.789,Love.
01:49:07.624,01:49:09.043,"Yes, love."
01:49:14.340,01:49:17.009,Don't you disapprove of me for what I've done?
01:49:17.051,01:49:20.595,No. I wish I'd done the same.
01:49:20.637,01:49:22.515,But no one asked me.
01:49:23.682,01:49:27.311,"Well, I wouldn't have been brave enough."
01:49:28.687,01:49:32.858,"Stiva, you know, he doesn't change."
01:49:34.026,01:49:35.944,"Like all men, I suppose."
01:50:37.590,01:50:39.258,I had an inspiration.
01:50:39.300,01:50:40.593,Why do we have to wait here?
01:50:40.633,01:50:42.470,Why can't we wait in the country?
01:50:42.511,01:50:44.679,I don't want to hear any more about a divorce or think about it.
01:50:44.721,01:50:46.723,"Good, I'm bored here."
01:50:46.765,01:50:48.850,"If I bore you here, I'll bore you in the country."
01:50:48.892,01:50:51.728,"I didn't say you bore me, Moscow bores me."
01:50:51.770,01:50:53.272,I can't be ready by tomorrow.
01:50:53.314,01:50:54.565,"The day after, then."
01:50:54.607,01:50:57.692,"No, wait, that's Sunday."
01:50:57.734,01:50:59.736,That's 20 minutes away on the train.
01:50:59.778,01:51:02.697,You could go to see her tomorrow.
01:51:02.739,01:51:05.700,Or was it that you wanted to spend Sunday with Princess Sorokina?
01:51:05.742,01:51:08.579,Please.
01:51:08.621,01:51:11.915,I can't see Maman tomorrow because she won't have read the papers she has to sign.
01:51:11.957,01:51:13.708,"In that case, let's not bother."
01:51:13.750,01:51:15.710,I'll leave on Sunday or not at all.
01:51:15.752,01:51:18.922,It's absurd to you because you have no understanding of my life here.
01:51:18.964,01:51:22.092,Anna.
01:51:22.134,01:51:24.761,You've given up everything for me and it's turned you against me.
01:51:24.803,01:51:26.721,Why lie about it?
01:51:26.763,01:51:29.724,I put off our departure for a day or two and you tell me I don't love you.
01:51:29.766,01:51:31.726,Because I've been living off your love and there's none left.
01:51:31.768,01:51:32.685,So this is over. Finished.
01:51:46.783,01:51:48.160,I'm sorry.
01:51:58.212,01:51:59.672,I don't mind when we go.
01:51:59.712,01:52:02.132,I'll telegraph Maman.
01:52:02.174,01:52:03.800,I'll do anything you want.
01:52:03.842,01:52:06.970,You should leave me.
01:52:07.804,01:52:08.721,Why?
01:52:09.973,01:52:12.976,You can't ask why about love.
01:52:39.044,01:52:41.796,"So, will you be all packed?"
01:52:41.838,01:52:43.965,I'll be out today making the arrangements.
01:52:44.007,01:52:47.302,Is that your way of telling me you'll be at your mother's with that simpering little princess?
01:52:47.344,01:52:50.222,"No. I'll be at my lawyer's, waiting for some documents."
01:52:50.264,01:52:52.182,Then I'm having dinner to say goodbye to old comrades.
01:52:52.224,01:52:53.308,I know what that means.
01:52:53.350,01:52:55.768,"My God, this is unendurable!"
01:52:57.854,01:52:59.398,"I can invite them here, if you like."
01:52:59.440,01:53:01.816,"Thank you, but if I'm not fit to dine in society, I won't eat with the band."
01:53:01.858,01:53:05.862,Who was the telegram from?
01:53:05.904,01:53:08.823,I didn't show you because Stiva keeps telegraphing what we already know.
01:53:08.865,01:53:10.492,"Karenin promises nothing, but will consider..."
01:53:10.534,01:53:13.662,"I told you I don't care about the divorce, so why hide the telegram?"
01:53:24.339,01:53:26.967,Is there anything you wish to say to me?
01:54:01.752,01:54:03.337,So it's the child.
01:54:04.087,01:54:05.714,She brought papers from Maman.
01:54:10.927,01:54:11.844,Anna.
01:54:31.948,01:54:32.907,No.
01:58:07.080,01:58:08.540,"Oh, God."
01:58:08.582,01:58:10.542,Forgive me.
01:58:47.454,01:58:50.373,I'll be buying in feed before winter's over.
01:58:50.415,01:58:54.836,"Well, you don't press people hard, but you live rightly."
01:58:54.878,01:58:57.297,"For your soul, not your belly."
01:59:00.216,01:59:02.218,How do we know what's rightly?
01:59:02.260,01:59:04.679,Just by knowing it.
01:59:05.430,01:59:09.183,But I believe in reason.
01:59:09.225,01:59:12.437,Reason. Was it reason that made you choose your wife?
01:59:39.673,01:59:41.549,I came looking for you.
01:59:44.052,01:59:46.013,I understood something.
01:59:46.054,01:59:47.973,What did you understand?
02:00:01.277,02:00:03.030,He smiled at me.
02:00:03.071,02:00:05.198,He's very advanced for his age.
02:00:08.284,02:00:10.203,What did you understand?
02:00:27.345,02:00:29.263,DOLLY: I'm so proud of you.
02:00:29.305,02:00:31.141,LILI: Night-night.
02:00:45.613,02:00:46.740,"And you, too."
02:00:46.781,02:00:49.242,"PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY: Good night, my darling boy."
02:01:09.971,02:01:11.347,SEROZHA: Anya!
02:01:12.807,02:01:14.226,Anya!
02:01:16.352,02:01:17.729,Anya!
