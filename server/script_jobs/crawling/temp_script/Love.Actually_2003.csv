00:46:57.875,00:46:59.291,... you're getting chubbier every day.
00:48:26.916,00:48:29.750,"Fuck, it's cold!"
00:48:36.500,00:48:39.125,This stuff better be good.
00:48:43.208,00:48:47.541,I don't want to drown saving some shit my grandmother could have written.
00:48:49.291,00:48:52.000,What kind of an idiot doesn't make copies?
00:48:58.250,00:49:00.708,Try not to disturb the eels.
00:49:22.958,00:49:25.958,Maybe you could name one of the characters after me.
00:49:27.875,00:49:29.875,Or give me 50% of the profits.
00:49:37.291,00:49:38.958,What kind of book is it?
00:49:54.875,00:49:56.875,Thriller... crime...
00:50:02.416,00:50:03.625,Frightening?
00:50:24.916,00:50:26.916,I'd better get back to work.
00:50:29.958,00:50:31.958,And then later you'll drive me home?
00:50:45.875,00:50:49.666,"It's the saddest part of my day, leaving you."
01:01:23.708,01:01:24.708,Thank you...
01:01:32.041,01:01:34.041,I will miss you.
01:01:36.875,01:01:38.875,And your very slow typing...
01:01:40.833,01:01:42.833,and your very bad driving...
01:22:38.791,01:22:40.375,Is this the way to the train station?
01:22:48.541,01:22:51.750,"Oh my God, I've got a terrible stomach ache."
01:22:51.833,01:22:53.833,It must have been the prawns.
01:22:58.666,01:23:02.833,"My goodness, this is a very big fish!"
01:23:03.166,01:23:05.625,It tastes delicious!
01:58:20.958,01:58:21.958,Good evening.
01:58:26.416,01:58:29.666,I am here to ask your daughter...
01:58:29.750,01:58:31.708,for her hands in marriage.
01:58:32.041,01:58:34.041,You want to marry my daughter?
01:58:34.541,01:58:35.541,Yes.
01:58:36.541,01:58:37.458,Come here...
01:58:37.541,01:58:39.083,... there is a man at the door.
01:58:40.541,01:58:41.875,He wants to marry you.
01:58:42.916,01:58:44.291,But I've never seen him before.
01:58:44.458,01:58:45.541,Who cares?
01:58:45.791,01:58:47.791,You're going to sell me to a complete stranger?
01:58:48.208,01:58:49.625,Sell? Who said sell?
01:58:49.833,01:58:51.250,I'll pay him.
01:58:51.333,01:58:54.958,Pardon me. I'm meaning your other daughter... Aurelia.
01:58:55.208,01:58:59.125,She's not here. She's at work. I'll take you.
01:58:59.666,01:59:01.083,You! Stay here.
01:59:01.166,01:59:02.541,As if I would.
01:59:02.625,01:59:03.625,Stupid!
01:59:07.458,01:59:11.125,Father is about to sell Aurelia as a slave to this Englishman.
01:59:24.208,01:59:26.208,"You better not say yes, father."
01:59:26.583,01:59:29.583,"Shut up, Miss Dunkin' Donut 2003."
02:01:22.958,02:01:25.708,Apparently he is going to kill Aurelia.
02:01:25.958,02:01:27.291,Cool!
02:03:10.833,02:03:12.291,Where is Aurelia?
02:03:12.375,02:03:13.833,Why should I tell you?
02:03:13.916,02:03:15.875,The man wants to marry her.
02:03:16.375,02:03:18.791,He can't do that. She's our best waitress.
02:03:58.333,02:04:00.583,Beautiful Aurelia...
02:04:01.708,02:04:06.458,I've come here with a view to asking you...
02:04:06.541,02:04:08.541,... to marriage me.
02:04:10.416,02:04:15.416,I know I seems an insane person because I hardly knows you...
02:04:17.083,02:04:28.208,"but sometimes things are so transparency, ... they don't need evidential proof."
02:04:31.000,02:04:36.000,"And I will inhabit here, or you can inhabit with me in England."
02:04:36.500,02:04:38.500,"Definitely go for England, girl."
02:04:38.625,02:04:41.875,You'll meet Prince William! Then you can marry him instead.
02:04:43.541,02:04:54.166,"Of course I don't expecting you to be as foolish as me, and of course I prediction you say no..."
02:04:56.375,02:05:03.375,... but it's Christmas and I just wanted to... check.
02:05:08.125,02:05:11.125,"Oh God! Say yes, you skinny moron."
02:05:29.750,02:05:30.958,What did you say?
02:05:32.125,02:05:33.541,"Yes, of course."
00:01:13.407,00:01:19.079,"Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think about the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport."
00:01:19.079,00:01:25.210,"General opinion's starting to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed, but I don't see that."
00:01:25.210,00:01:27.838,Seems to me that love is everywhere.
00:01:27.838,00:01:32.634,"Often it's not particularly dignified or newsworthy, but it's always there."
00:01:32.634,00:01:39.266,"Fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends."
00:01:39.266,00:01:46.356,"When the planes hit the Twin Towers, as far as I know, none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge."
00:01:46.356,00:01:48.859,They were all messages of love.
00:01:48.859,00:01:53.072,"If you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling you'll find that love actually..."
00:01:53.072,00:01:56.157,is all around.
00:02:26.063,00:02:29.149,"- I'm afraid you did it again, Bill."
00:02:29.149,00:02:33.695,"It's just I know the old version so well, you know."
00:02:33.695,00:02:35.990,"Well, we all do."
00:02:35.990,00:02:40.201,- That's why we're making the new version.
00:02:54.675,00:02:57.427,"Oh, fuck!"
00:02:57.427,00:03:00.179,"Wank, bugger, shitting, arsehead and hole."
00:03:02.349,00:03:04.351,Start again.
00:03:50.397,00:03:54.359,"- This is shit, isn't it?"
00:03:54.359,00:03:58.279,"Yep, solid gold shit, maestro."
00:04:21.469,00:04:25.390,"God, I'm so late."
00:04:25.390,00:04:28.727,Are you sure... you don't mind me going without you?
00:04:28.727,00:04:31.188,"No, really."
00:04:31.188,00:04:33.941,I love you.
00:04:33.941,00:04:38.112,I love you even when you're sick and look disgusting.
00:04:38.112,00:04:41.865,"I know. Now go, or you will actually miss it."
00:04:41.865,00:04:43.992,Right.
00:04:46.203,00:04:48.872,- Did I mention that I love you?
00:04:48.872,00:04:51.458,"Get out, loser."
00:05:07.975,00:05:10.894,"Karen, it's me again."
00:05:10.894,00:05:15.523,"I'm sorry, I-- I literally don't have anybody else to talk to."
00:05:15.523,00:05:19.694,Absolutely.
00:05:19.694,00:05:22.864,- Of course.
00:05:19.694,00:05:25.325,- Doesn't mean I'm not terribly concerned that your wife just died.
00:05:25.325,00:05:27.452,Understood.
00:05:27.452,00:05:30.164,"Uh, bugger off and call me later."
00:05:33.625,00:05:37.629,- So what's this big news then?
00:05:37.629,00:05:39.506,And I'm the lobster.
00:05:39.506,00:05:41.758,The lobster?
00:05:41.758,00:05:43.927,In the Nativity play?
00:05:43.927,00:05:48.389,First lobster.
00:05:48.389,00:05:50.184,Duh.
00:05:55.647,00:05:58.025,Best sandwiches in Britain.
00:05:59.109,00:06:01.278,Try my lovely nuts?
00:06:03.655,00:06:06.449,Beautiful muffin for a beautiful lady.
00:06:09.828,00:06:12.122,"Morning, my future wife."
00:06:29.848,00:06:31.933,"Okay, you can stop there."
00:06:31.933,00:06:35.062,"Dave, I'm gonna need a couple of orange gels please, mate."
00:06:35.062,00:06:38.606,"By the way, he introduced me as John, but actually everyone calls me Jack."
00:06:38.606,00:06:41.360,"Oh, fine."
00:06:41.360,00:06:45.822,He got me right though.
00:06:51.286,00:06:54.248,No surprises?
00:06:54.248,00:06:57.500,Not like the stag night?
00:06:57.500,00:06:59.920,Do you admit the Brazilian prostitutes were a mistake?
00:06:59.920,00:07:02.005,I do.
00:07:02.005,00:07:05.175,And it would have been much better if they'd not turned out to be men?
00:07:05.175,00:07:07.635,That is true.
00:07:09.304,00:07:11.181,"Good luck, kiddo."
00:07:34.746,00:07:37.582,"Prime Minister, over here!"
00:07:49.136,00:07:51.096,Thank you.
00:07:52.680,00:07:57.185,"Welcome, Prime Minister."
00:07:57.185,00:07:59.187,How are you?
00:07:59.187,00:08:03.691,How are you feeling?
00:08:03.691,00:08:06.320,Would you like to meet your household staff?
00:08:06.320,00:08:09.197,"Yes, I would like that very much indeed."
00:08:09.197,00:08:11.908,Anything to put off actually running the country.
00:08:13.576,00:08:15.745,This is Terence.
00:08:15.745,00:08:17.747,"Good morning, sir."
00:08:17.747,00:08:21.293,I had an uncle called Terence once. Hated him.
00:08:21.293,00:08:24.045,But I very much like the look of you.
00:08:24.045,00:08:26.256,This is Pat.
00:08:26.256,00:08:28.467,"Good morning, sir."
00:08:28.467,00:08:31.470,"Oh, right. Well, should be a lot easier with me than with the last lot."
00:08:31.470,00:08:34.306,"No nappies, no teenagers, no scary wife."
00:08:34.306,00:08:37.267,And this is Natalie.
00:08:37.267,00:08:39.394,"Hello, Natalie."
00:08:39.394,00:08:43.398,"I mean, sir. Shit, I can't believe I've just said that."
00:08:43.398,00:08:47.152,And now I've gone and said shit. Twice.
00:08:47.152,00:08:50.905,"It's fine, it's fine. You could have said fuck and then we'd have been in real trouble."
00:08:50.905,00:08:54.742,"Thank you, sir. I did have an awful premonition I was gonna fuck up on my first day."
00:08:55.952,00:08:57.537,"Oh, piss it."
00:08:59.164,00:09:01.749,Right.
00:09:01.749,00:09:04.211,"And then let's fix the country, shall we?"
00:09:04.211,00:09:06.213,"Yeah, I can't see why not."
00:09:19.100,00:09:21.561,It's all right.
00:09:21.561,00:09:23.188,"Yes, I did."
00:09:23.188,00:09:26.066,Hello there.
00:09:26.066,00:09:29.861,"Yes, and I'm in here."
00:09:35.950,00:09:38.161,"Oh, no."
00:09:38.161,00:09:40.663,That is so inconvenient.
00:09:42.582,00:09:47.421,"In the presence of God, Peter and Juliet have given their consent..."
00:09:47.421,00:09:49.381,and made their marriage vows to each other.
00:09:49.381,00:09:53.218,They have declared their marriage by the giving and receiving of rings.
00:09:53.218,00:09:57.847,I therefore proclaim that they are husband and wife.
00:10:03.186,00:10:08.066,And you resisted the temptation for surprises?
00:10:27.210,00:10:29.670,- Did you do this?
00:10:29.670,00:10:31.839,"Uh, no."
00:10:42.058,00:11:32.775,"Oh, it's-- but you can learn how Hello. What the hell are you doing here?"
00:11:32.775,00:11:35.694,"Oh, I just, uh, popped over to borrow some old CDs."
00:11:35.694,00:11:38.615,"- The lady of the house let you in, did she?"
00:11:38.615,00:11:41.535,"- Lovely, obliging girl."
00:11:41.535,00:11:45.539,"I just thought I'd pop back before the reception, see if she's better. This is good."
00:11:45.539,00:11:50.251,- Oh.
00:11:50.251,00:11:53.588,I think perhaps we ought to take Mum out for her birthday on Friday.
00:11:53.588,00:11:56.715,What do you think? I just feel we've been bad sons this year.
00:11:56.715,00:11:59.260,"Sounds fine. A bit, you know, boring, but fine."
00:11:59.260,00:12:01.221,"Hurry up, big boy!"
00:11:59.260,00:12:05.975,"I'm naked, and I want you at least twice before Jamie gets home."
00:12:15.734,00:12:19.364,I am so happy to see you guys.
00:12:19.364,00:12:22.825,Delicious delicacy?
00:12:27.664,00:12:30.041,Taste explosion?
00:12:42.053,00:12:44.347,Food?
00:12:44.347,00:12:46.307,"Yeah, a bit dodgy, isn't it?"
00:12:46.307,00:12:50.061,Looks like a dead baby's finger.
00:12:50.061,00:12:52.689,"Oh, yeah, tastes like it too."
00:12:56.234,00:12:59.320,"I'm Colin, by the way."
00:12:59.320,00:13:02.407,"Wicked. And what do you do, Nancy?"
00:13:02.407,00:13:04.200,I'm a cook.
00:13:04.200,00:13:06.869,"Yes, I do."
00:13:06.869,00:13:08.871,They did.
00:13:08.871,00:13:13.042,"- God, I wish you hadn't turned it down."
00:13:13.042,00:13:15.378,Right.
00:13:18.005,00:13:21.134,I have just worked out why I can never find true love.
00:13:21.134,00:13:23.844,English girls.
00:13:23.844,00:13:28.767,"And I am primarily attractive to girls who are, you know, cooler, game for a laugh."
00:13:28.767,00:13:33.020,Like American girls.
00:13:33.020,00:13:36.274,I would get a girlfriend there instantly.
00:13:36.274,00:13:38.610,"I think it's crap, Colin."
00:13:38.610,00:13:40.403,"No, that's where you're wrong."
00:13:40.403,00:13:43.490,American girls would seriously dig me with my cute British accent.
00:13:43.490,00:13:46.409,- You don't have a cute British accent.
00:13:46.409,00:13:48.495,I'm going to America.
00:13:48.495,00:13:51.247,"You're a lonely, ugly arsehole, and you must accept it."
00:13:51.247,00:13:56.336,"Never. I am Colin, God of Sex."
00:13:56.336,00:13:59.213,"A bit of quiet while we finish the lighting, guys."
00:13:59.213,00:14:01.882,"I tell you, I thought I was never gonna make it here today."
00:14:01.882,00:14:03.968,"The traffic was just-- Oh, unbelievable."
00:14:03.968,00:14:06.387,"Judy, um, could you take the top off this time?"
00:14:06.387,00:14:09.056,Lighting and camera need to know when we're actually gonna...
00:14:09.056,00:14:10.809,"see the, um, nipples and when we're not."
00:14:10.809,00:14:12.977,"Yes, okay. Right."
00:14:12.977,00:14:15.896,At least it's nice and warm in here.
00:14:15.896,00:14:19.776,"I was standing in for Brad Pitt once on, you know, Seven Years In Tibet."
00:14:19.776,00:14:21.902,"Yes, yeah."
00:14:19.776,00:14:24.739,"Bloody freezing, right-- Sorry, guys."
00:14:24.739,00:14:29.327,Fine.
00:14:29.327,00:14:31.954,"Right, let's have another look at that then, please."
00:14:31.954,00:14:33.456,Okay.
00:14:45.051,00:14:47.595,And Jerry says if you could just put your hands on her breasts.
00:14:47.595,00:14:50.223,"Oh, right, okay, yeah."
00:14:50.223,00:14:52.016,I'll warm 'em up.
00:14:52.016,00:14:54.728,Right.
00:14:54.728,00:14:57.772,"- And massage them, please."
00:15:03.110,00:15:05.739,"It's Junction 13 that's just murder, isn't it?"
00:15:05.739,00:15:08.241,Total gridlock this morning.
00:15:12.161,00:15:15.456,Jo and I had a lot of time to prepare for this moment.
00:15:17.083,00:15:25.383,"Some of her, uh, requests, uh, for instance, that I should bring Claudia Schiffer as my date to the funeral..."
00:15:25.383,00:15:29.220,I was confident she expected me to ignore.
00:15:29.220,00:15:33.767,But others she was pretty damn clear about.
00:15:33.767,00:15:40.857,"When she first mentioned what's about to happen, I said, Over my dead body."
00:15:40.857,00:15:43.902,"And she said, No, Daniel, over mine."
00:15:43.902,00:15:47.280,"And, uh, as usual, my darling girl..."
00:15:49.616,00:15:52.619,"and Sam's darling mum, was right."
00:15:52.619,00:15:59.584,"So she's going to say her final farewell to you, not through me, but inevitably..."
00:16:00.794,00:16:03.963,ever so coolly...
00:16:03.963,00:16:08.718,through the immortal genius of the Bay City Rollers.
00:17:06.066,00:17:08.820,Do you love him?
00:17:08.820,00:17:11.030,"Uh, what?"
00:17:11.030,00:17:13.032,"No, I just thought I'd ask the blunt question..."
00:17:13.032,00:17:16.035,"in case it was the right one, and you needed someone to talk to about it."
00:17:16.035,00:17:19.121,"And no one had ever asked you, so you'd never been able to talk about it..."
00:17:19.121,00:17:21.916,even though you might have wanted to.
00:17:21.916,00:17:24.752,Ab-Absolutely not.
00:17:26.754,00:17:30.466,"So, that's a no then?"
00:17:30.466,00:17:39.893,"Um-- This deejay, what do you reckon?"
00:17:39.893,00:17:43.980,Probably.
00:17:43.980,00:17:45.940,Now here's one for the lovers.
00:17:45.940,00:17:49.861,That's quite a few of you.
00:17:56.367,00:17:59.662,He's done it. It's official.
00:18:08.713,00:18:11.966,Sarah is waiting for you.
00:18:11.966,00:18:17.805,"Oh, yes, of course. Um-- Great. Uh, good, good."
00:18:17.805,00:18:21.935,"How are you doing, Mia?"
00:18:21.935,00:18:23.728,Absolutely.
00:18:25.939,00:18:29.233,Harry?
00:18:29.233,00:18:35.155,"and, um, tell me exactly how long it is that you've been working here."
00:18:35.155,00:18:42.997,"Um-- Two years, seven months, three days and, I suppose, what, two hours?"
00:18:42.997,00:18:48.252,"And how long have you been in love with Karl, our enigmatic chief designer?"
00:18:49.796,00:18:59.597,"Um-- Two years, seven months, three days and, I suppose, an hour and 30 minutes."
00:18:59.597,00:19:02.558,Thought as much.
00:19:02.558,00:19:04.644,Yes.
00:19:04.644,00:19:06.854,Yes.
00:19:06.854,00:19:09.899,"Oh, that is-- That is bad news."
00:19:09.899,00:19:15.446,"Well, I just thought that maybe the time had come to do something about it."
00:19:15.446,00:19:17.364,Like what?
00:19:17.364,00:19:23.997,"Invite him out for a drink, and then after about 20 minutes, casually drop into the conversation that you'd like to marry him and have lots of sex and babies."
00:19:23.997,00:19:27.458,You know that?
00:19:27.458,00:19:29.836,And so does Karl.
00:19:29.836,00:19:32.505,"Think about it, for all our sakes."
00:19:32.505,00:19:34.173,It's Christmas.
00:19:36.216,00:19:38.218,Certainly. Excellent.
00:19:38.218,00:19:41.180,Will do.
00:19:42.723,00:19:45.143,"Hi, Sarah."
00:19:45.143,00:19:47.812,Excuse me.
00:19:56.529,00:19:58.405,Babe.
00:19:58.405,00:20:00.950,Absolutely.
00:20:00.950,00:20:04.037,"Mia? Mia, could you turn that down?"
00:20:05.121,00:20:07.081,What is that?
00:20:07.081,00:20:10.710,And that was the Christmas effort by the once-great Billy Mack.
00:20:10.710,00:20:13.420,"Oh, dear me, how are the mighty fallen."
00:20:13.420,00:20:15.422,I could safely put my hand up my arse and say...
00:20:15.422,00:20:19.510,that is the worst record I've heard this century.
00:20:19.510,00:20:26.559,"Oh, and coincidentally, I believe Billy will be a guest on my friend Mike's show in a few minutes' time."
00:20:26.559,00:20:29.770,"Welcome back, Bill."
00:20:29.770,00:20:31.898,"So, Billy, welcome back to the airwaves."
00:20:31.898,00:20:35.109,"New Christmas single, cover of Love Is All Around."
00:20:35.109,00:20:40.280,Except we've changed the word love to Christmas.
00:20:40.280,00:20:43.826,"Yes. Uh, is that an important message to you, Bill?"
00:20:43.826,00:20:46.286,"Not really, Mike."
00:20:46.286,00:20:50.708,Christmas is a time for people with someone they love in their lives.
00:20:50.708,00:20:53.460,- And that's not you?
00:20:53.460,00:20:57.173,"When I was young and successful, I was greedy and foolish."
00:20:57.173,00:21:01.552,"And now I'm left with no one, wrinkled and alone."
00:21:01.552,00:21:03.763,"Wow. Um, thanks for that, Bill."
00:21:03.763,00:21:07.100,- For what?
00:21:07.100,00:21:10.978,"Doesn't often happen here at Radio Watford, I can tell you."
00:21:10.978,00:21:14.899,"- Ask me anything you like, I'll tell you the truth."
00:21:14.899,00:21:17.693,- Britney Spears.
00:21:17.693,00:21:19.946,"No, only kidding."
00:21:19.946,00:21:21.280,She was rubbish.
00:21:21.280,00:21:23.699,"Okay. Um, here's one."
00:21:21.280,00:21:27.078,How do you think the new record compares to your old classic stuff?
00:21:27.078,00:21:30.748,"Oh, come on, Mikey."
00:21:32.458,00:21:42.676,"But wouldn't it be great if number one this Christmas wasn't some smug teenager, but an old ex-heroin addict, searching for a comeback at any price?"
00:21:42.676,00:21:48.599,"All those young popsters, come Christmas Day, they'll be stretched out naked with a cute bird balancing on their balls."
00:21:48.599,00:21:59.359,"And I'll be stuck in some dingy flat with me manager, Joe, ugliest man in the world, fucking miserable because our fucking gamble didn't pay off."
00:21:59.359,00:22:08.494,"So if you believe in Father Christmas, children, like your Uncle Billy does, buy my festering turd of a record."
00:22:08.494,00:22:16.043,And particularly enjoy the incredible crassness of the moment when we try to squeeze an extra syllable into the fourth line.
00:22:16.043,00:22:24.177,I think you're referring to-- Come on and let it snow. Ouch.
00:22:24.177,00:22:26.304,"So, uh, here it is one more time."
00:22:26.304,00:22:31.433,"The dark horse for this year's Christmas number one, Christmas Is All Around."
00:22:31.433,00:22:34.228,"Thank you, Billy."
00:22:34.228,00:22:36.856,Is the new prime minister in trouble already?
00:22:42.111,00:22:44.071,"Okay, what's next?"
00:22:44.071,00:22:46.699,The president's visit.
00:22:46.699,00:22:48.951,I fear this is going to be a difficult one to play.
00:22:48.951,00:22:53.206,Alex?
00:22:48.951,00:22:56.917,There's a very strong feeling in the party we mustn't allow ourselves to be bullied from pillar to post like the last government.
00:22:56.917,00:23:00.171,Hear. Hear.
00:23:00.171,00:23:02.840,Let's take a stand.
00:23:02.840,00:23:08.762,"Right. I understand that, but I have decided... not to."
00:23:08.762,00:23:11.807,Not this time.
00:23:08.762,00:23:15.102,"We will, of course, try to be clever, but let's not forget that America is the most powerful country in the world."
00:23:15.102,00:23:19.481,I'm not gonna act like a petulant child.
00:23:19.481,00:23:23.401,Who do you have to screw round here to get a cup of tea and a chocolate biscuit?
00:23:29.200,00:23:32.078,Right.
00:23:32.078,00:23:35.122,"Yeah, come in."
00:23:39.417,00:23:42.004,These have just come through from the Treasury.
00:23:42.004,00:23:46.175,- Uh-huh.
00:23:46.175,00:23:49.887,- Excellent. Thanks a lot.
00:23:49.887,00:23:52.265,Not that I wouldn't have been nice to the other bloke too.
00:23:52.265,00:23:55.017,Just always given him the boring biscuits with no chocolate.
00:23:55.017,00:23:57.103,Ha! Thanks very much.
00:23:57.103,00:24:01.315,Thanks-- Natalie.
00:24:04.693,00:24:06.862,"Oh, God."
00:24:06.862,00:24:11.284,Come on. Get a grip.
00:24:11.284,00:24:13.327,Raise the lamp a bit.
00:24:13.327,00:24:15.829,"So, what do you reckon to our new prime minister, then?"
00:24:15.829,00:24:17.873,"Oh, I like him."
00:24:17.873,00:24:20.418,I can't understand why he's not married though.
00:24:20.418,00:24:23.587,"Well, you know the type."
00:24:23.587,00:24:26.840,Either that or gay as a picnic basket.
00:24:26.840,00:24:31.469,"Um, excuse me. Judy, if you could just lower the nipples and cheat them a bit to the left."
00:24:31.469,00:24:32.930,Okay.
00:24:36.267,00:24:38.769,"You know, I have to say, Judy, this is a real pleasure."
00:24:38.769,00:24:42.189,It's lovely to find someone I can actually chat to.
00:24:42.189,00:24:44.150,Thank you.
00:24:44.150,00:24:46.402,And ditto.
00:24:46.402,00:24:49.196,"- And the move again, please, Judy."
00:24:49.196,00:24:51.407,"Oh, God, I'm sorry."
00:24:53.867,00:24:57.330,Exciting news.
00:24:57.330,00:24:59.539,I've bought a ticket to the States.
00:24:59.539,00:25:01.667,I'm off in three weeks.
00:25:01.667,00:25:06.504,Yes! To a fantastic place called Wisconsin.
00:25:06.504,00:25:08.590,Yes! Wisconsin babes.
00:25:08.590,00:25:11.427,Here comes Sir Colin!
00:25:11.427,00:25:17.515,"There are a few babes in America, I grant you, but they're already going out with rich, attractive guys."
00:25:17.515,00:25:20.602,"Now, Tone, you're just jealous."
00:25:20.602,00:25:30.779,You know perfectly well that any bar anywhere in America contains ten girls more beautiful and more likely to have sex with me than the whole of the United Kingdom.
00:25:30.779,00:25:32.739,That is total bollocks.
00:25:32.739,00:25:35.034,You've actually gone mad now.
00:25:35.034,00:25:38.954,"Stateside, I am Prince William without the weird family."
00:25:38.954,00:25:41.207,"No, Colin, no."
00:25:41.207,00:25:42.416,Nyet!
00:25:42.416,00:25:43.959,Nein!
00:25:43.959,00:25:45.878,"Right, the Christmas party."
00:25:45.878,00:25:50.299,Not my favorite night of the year and your unhappy job to organize.
00:25:50.299,00:25:53.302,Tell me.
00:25:53.302,00:26:01.227,"Find a venue, over-order on the drinks, bulk-buy the guacamole and advise the girls to avoid Kevin if they want their breasts un-fondled."
00:26:01.227,00:26:03.312,Wives and family and stuff?
00:26:03.312,00:26:09.276,"Yes. I mean, not children, but their wives and girlfriends, et cetera."
00:26:09.276,00:26:15.699,"Oh, Christ, you haven't got some horrible six-foot, tight-T-shirt-wearing boyfriend you'll be bringing, have you?"
00:26:15.699,00:26:20.829,"I'll just be hanging around the mistletoe, hoping to be kissed."
00:26:20.829,00:26:22.706,Really?
00:26:23.916,00:26:25.334,Right.
00:26:34.510,00:26:37.888,He now spends all the time in his room.
00:26:37.888,00:26:41.475,"I mean, he'll be up there now."
00:26:41.475,00:26:43.227,My horrid son-- Bernard?
00:26:43.227,00:26:46.439,Bernard-- stays in his room all the time.
00:26:46.439,00:26:47.814,Thank goodness.
00:26:47.814,00:26:52.069,"Yeah, but, Karen, this is all the time."
00:26:52.069,00:26:56.365,"I'm afraid that there's something really wrong, you know?"
00:26:56.365,00:27:03.830,"I mean, clearly it's about his mum, but, Christ, he-- He might be injecting heroin into his eyeballs for all I know."
00:27:03.830,00:27:07.543,At the age of 11?
00:27:07.543,00:27:09.753,Maybe just his veins.
00:27:09.753,00:27:23.434,"You see, the problem is it was his mum who always used to talk to him, you know, and-- I don't know, the whole stepfather thing seems suddenly to somehow matter like it never did before."
00:27:23.434,00:27:28.188,"Listen, it was always going to be a totally shit time."
00:27:28.188,00:27:29.689,Just be patient.
00:27:30.983,00:27:33.527,And maybe check the room for needles.
00:27:33.527,00:27:38.782,"And then when he sometimes does come out, it's obvious he's been crying."
00:27:47.541,00:27:51.711,It's just such a ridiculous waste.
00:27:51.711,00:27:57.384,And now if it's going to ruin Sam's life as well-- I just don't know.
00:27:58.927,00:28:01.514,Get a grip.
00:28:01.514,00:28:03.723,People hate sissies.
00:28:03.723,00:28:06.519,No one's ever gonna shag you if you cry all the time.
00:28:06.519,00:28:10.022,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:28:10.022,00:28:12.149,Helpful.
00:28:19.781,00:28:25.245,"So, what's the problem, Samuel?"
00:28:25.245,00:28:30.584,"Is it just Mum, or is it something else, hmm?"
00:28:31.709,00:28:35.088,Maybe... school?
00:28:35.088,00:28:38.258,Are you being bullied?
00:28:38.258,00:28:40.927,Or is it something worse?
00:28:42.513,00:28:46.016,Can you give me any clues at all?
00:28:46.016,00:28:49.395,You really want to know?
00:28:49.395,00:28:52.022,Even though you won't be able to do anything to help?
00:28:52.022,00:28:55.067,"Even if that's the case, yeah."
00:28:56.485,00:29:04.951,"Okay. Well, the truth is, actually, I'm in love."
00:29:04.951,00:29:07.705,Sorry?
00:29:07.705,00:29:15.003,"I know I should be thinking about Mum all the time, and I am, but the truth is I'm in love, and I was before she died, and there's nothing I can do about it."
00:29:16.380,00:29:19.216,Aren't you a bit young to be in love?
00:29:19.216,00:29:20.884,No.
00:29:20.884,00:29:23.429,"Oh, well, okay, right."
00:29:23.429,00:29:27.683,"Well, I mean, I'm a little relieved."
00:29:27.683,00:29:29.893,Why?
00:29:29.893,00:29:33.772,"Well, because I thought it would be something worse."
00:29:33.772,00:29:36.275,Worse than the total agony of being in love?
00:29:36.275,00:29:43.657,"Um-- No, you're right."
00:30:20.986,00:30:23.822,"- Night, Sarah."
00:30:33.540,00:30:36.710,Yeah? Absolutely.
00:30:36.710,00:30:39.129,Free as a bird. Fire away.
00:31:10.452,00:31:12.579,Alone again.
00:31:13.831,00:31:15.666,Naturally.
00:31:15.666,00:31:18.877,I'll deal with it in the morning.
00:31:18.877,00:31:22.047,"Ah, Natalie."
00:31:24.132,00:31:26.218,Thanks.
00:31:26.218,00:31:28.178,Natalie.
00:31:29.763,00:31:34.434,"Um, I'm starting to feel..."
00:31:34.434,00:31:40.106,uncomfortable about us working in such close proximity every day and me knowing so little about you.
00:31:40.106,00:31:43.193,"It seems, uh-- It seems elitist and wrong."
00:31:43.193,00:31:45.821,"Well, there's not much to know."
00:31:45.821,00:31:49.324,"Well, um, where do you live, for instance?"
00:31:49.324,00:31:51.660,Wandsworth. The dodgy end.
00:31:51.660,00:31:54.162,"Ah, my sister lives in Wandsworth."
00:31:54.162,00:31:56.206,Oh.
00:31:56.206,00:31:58.917,So which exactly is the dodgy end?
00:31:58.917,00:32:00.586,Right at the end of the high street.
00:32:00.586,00:32:02.588,Harris Street.
00:32:02.588,00:32:05.340,"- Oh, yeah, yeah, that is dodgy."
00:32:05.340,00:32:09.887,"Um, and, uh, you live with your husband, uh, boyfriend?"
00:32:11.054,00:32:13.139,Three illegitimate but charming children?
00:32:13.139,00:32:18.854,"No, I've, um, just split up with my boyfriend actually, so I'm back with my mum and dad for a while."
00:32:18.854,00:32:21.147,Ah. Sorry.
00:32:21.147,00:32:25.652,"No, it's fine."
00:32:25.652,00:32:28.280,- He said I was getting fat.
00:32:28.280,00:32:32.409,He said no one's gonna fancy a girl with thighs the size of big tree trunks.
00:32:32.409,00:32:36.580,"Not a nice guy, actually, in the end."
00:32:36.580,00:32:38.582,Ah.
00:32:45.798,00:32:51.804,"You know, um, being prime minister, I could just have him murdered."
00:32:51.804,00:32:55.432,"Thank you, sir."
00:32:55.432,00:32:59.394,Do. The S.A.S.
00:32:59.394,00:33:02.439,Ruthless trained killers are just a phone call away.
00:33:08.612,00:33:10.614,"Oh, God."
00:33:13.742,00:33:15.285,You have this kind of problem?
00:33:18.371,00:33:21.333,"Yeah, course you did, you saucy minx."
00:33:21.333,00:33:23.168,So let's go.
00:33:23.168,00:33:27.088,We can definitely crack this.
00:33:27.088,00:33:29.132,So come on.
00:33:29.132,00:33:32.093,Right?
00:33:32.093,00:33:36.682,"Uh-huh, good, good."
00:33:36.682,00:33:39.643,She doesn't even know my name.
00:33:39.643,00:33:42.395,"And even if she did, she'd despise me."
00:33:42.395,00:33:47.400,"She's the coolest girl in school, and everyone worships her because she's heaven."
00:33:49.194,00:33:51.780,Good. Good.
00:33:52.823,00:33:57.744,"Well, basically you're fucked, aren't you?"
00:34:04.001,00:34:06.419,Hi there and welcome back.
00:34:06.419,00:34:08.714,"So, Billy, three weeks till Christmas."
00:34:08.714,00:34:11.008,Looks like the real competition is gonna be Blue.
00:34:11.008,00:34:13.510,Yeah. I saw them on the show last week.
00:34:13.510,00:34:15.637,They weren't very nice about my record.
00:34:15.637,00:34:18.056,"No, little scamps."
00:34:18.056,00:34:21.518,"But very, very talented musicians."
00:34:21.518,00:34:25.939,"Yeah. Uh, Billy, I understand you've got a prize for our competition winners."
00:34:25.939,00:34:27.983,"Yes, I have, Ant or Dec."
00:34:27.983,00:34:31.277,It's a personalized felt-tip pen.
00:34:31.277,00:34:34.239,"Oh, great."
00:34:34.239,00:34:36.950,It even writes on glass.
00:34:36.950,00:34:43.749,"So if you've got a framed picture like, for instance, this one of Blue, you can just write on it."
00:34:57.596,00:35:01.725,"kids watching, Billy."
00:35:01.725,00:35:04.519,"Hiya, kids."
00:35:04.519,00:35:07.940,Here's an important message from your Uncle Bill.
00:35:07.940,00:35:10.316,Don't buy drugs.
00:35:12.235,00:35:15.030,Become a pop star and they give you them for free.
00:35:15.030,00:35:18.324,"And I do believe, uh, it's a commercial break, thank goodness."
00:35:18.324,00:35:20.410,We'll see you soon. Bye-bye.
00:35:32.297,00:35:33.882,"Oh, look at him. Eww!"
00:35:33.882,00:35:36.426,Just a minute.
00:35:36.426,00:35:39.137,"Actually, they're not funny."
00:35:43.433,00:35:47.020,"Okay, let's say, uh, Thursday, my place?"
00:35:47.020,00:35:50.816,I've got Juliet on the other line. Can I patch you through?
00:35:50.816,00:35:52.567,"Okay, fine."
00:35:52.567,00:35:55.737,"Thanks and, uh, be nice."
00:35:55.737,00:36:00.742,I'm-- I'm always nice.
00:36:00.742,00:36:03.453,I'm always-- Mark?
00:36:03.453,00:36:06.414,Hi. How was the honeymoon?
00:36:06.414,00:36:09.250,"Oh, it was great. And thanks for the gorgeous send-off."
00:36:09.250,00:36:12.879,"So, what can I do for you?"
00:36:12.879,00:36:15.799,"I've just tried the wedding video, and it's a complete disaster."
00:36:15.799,00:36:18.969,It's come out all blue and wibbly.
00:36:18.969,00:36:22.764,"And I remember you filming a lot on the day, and I just wondered if I could look at your stuff."
00:36:22.764,00:36:25.767,"Oh, no. Look, to be honest, I didn't really, you know-- Please?"
00:36:25.767,00:36:29.729,All I want is just one shot of me in a wedding dress that isn't bright turquoise.
00:36:29.729,00:36:32.983,"Okay, I'll have a look, but to be honest, I'm pretty sure I wiped it."
00:36:32.983,00:36:36.028,So don't get any hopes up.
00:36:42.367,00:36:45.078,Any progress with our matchmaking plans?
00:36:45.078,00:36:48.999,No. I've done fuck-all and never will because he's too good for me.
00:36:48.999,00:36:51.292,How true.
00:36:52.585,00:36:54.004,Ouch.
00:36:54.004,00:36:57.507,"And, of course, your mobile goes."
00:36:57.507,00:37:01.178,"Hello, hi."
00:37:01.178,00:37:03.513,"So, how's the Christmas party going?"
00:37:03.513,00:37:07.017,Good.
00:37:07.017,00:37:10.020,- What's it like?
00:37:10.020,00:37:11.980,It's an art gallery.
00:37:11.980,00:37:16.568,Full of dark corners for doing dark deeds.
00:37:18.820,00:37:22.032,Right. Good.
00:37:22.032,00:37:25.160,"Well, I suppose I should take a look at it or something."
00:37:25.160,00:37:27.286,You should.
00:37:46.223,00:37:48.850,"Ah, bonjour, Eleonore."
00:37:48.850,00:37:50.560,Welcome back.
00:37:50.560,00:37:52.896,And this year you bring a lady guest?
00:37:52.896,00:37:56.066,"Uh, no, there's a change of situation. It's just me."
00:37:56.066,00:37:59.027,Oh. Am I sad or not sad?
00:37:59.027,00:38:02.030,"Well, I think you're not surprised."
00:38:02.030,00:38:04.407,"Yeah, yeah."
00:38:04.407,00:38:08.327,"Well, I find you a perfect lady to clean the house."
00:38:08.327,00:38:11.581,This is Aurelia.
00:38:11.581,00:38:13.583,Ah.
00:38:13.583,00:38:16.253,"Uh, bonjour, Aurelia."
00:38:16.253,00:38:18.504,Bonjour.
00:38:22.884,00:38:28.056,"Uh, unfortunately she cannot speak French, just like you."
00:38:28.056,00:38:30.809,- She's Portuguese.
00:38:30.809,00:38:33.519,Buongiorno. Eusébio.
00:38:35.188,00:38:38.942,Molto bueno.
00:38:38.942,00:38:42.737,I think she's 10 years too young to remember there was a footballer called Eusébio.
00:38:42.737,00:38:45.824,"And, uh, molto bueno is Spanish."
00:38:45.824,00:38:50.287,"Right, right."
00:38:50.287,00:38:53.957,Perhaps you can drive her home at the end of her work.
00:38:53.957,00:38:57.127,"Con grande, uh, plesoro."
00:38:57.127,00:39:00.213,Which is what? Turkish?
00:39:06.970,00:39:09.306,Bello.
00:39:10.807,00:39:13.852,"Uh, bella."
00:39:13.852,00:39:17.814,"Uh, montagno. Arbore."
00:39:21.151,00:39:24.612,"No, right."
00:39:25.947,00:39:28.200,As the Tremeloes said.
00:39:29.450,00:39:31.703,Clever guys.
00:39:31.703,00:39:36.082,"Although I think the original version was by, uh, Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons."
00:39:36.082,00:39:38.376,Great-- Great-- Great band.
00:39:41.587,00:39:44.174,"Oh, shut up."
00:40:03.151,00:40:04.861,"Mr. President, welcome."
00:40:04.861,00:40:07.322,It's a pleasure to meet you.
00:40:07.322,00:40:10.116,"I'm sorry your wife couldn't make it, by the way."
00:40:10.116,00:40:12.618,"Although she would have been kind of lonely, I'm sure."
00:40:12.618,00:40:14.704,"Yes. Pathetic, isn't it?"
00:40:14.704,00:40:17.665,"Just, uh, never been able to tie a girl down."
00:40:17.665,00:40:20.252,I'm not sure that politics and dating really go together.
00:40:20.252,00:40:22.795,Really?
00:40:22.795,00:40:27.633,"Well, the difference is you're still sickeningly handsome, whereas I look increasingly like my Aunt Mildred."
00:40:27.633,00:40:29.886,"I'm very jealous of your plane, by the way."
00:40:29.886,00:40:32.471,Thank you.
00:40:32.471,00:40:34.640,"Ah, Natalie. Hi."
00:40:34.640,00:40:38.686,"Morning, ma'am."
00:40:38.686,00:40:42.023,Excellent.
00:40:42.023,00:40:46.361,that's a pretty little son of a bitch right there.
00:40:46.361,00:40:48.780,Did you see those pipes?
00:40:48.780,00:40:52.075,"Yeah, yeah."
00:40:52.075,00:40:56.871,"No, absolutely not."
00:40:56.871,00:41:00.333,- That is unexpected.
00:41:00.333,00:41:04.712,The last administration made it perfectly clear.
00:41:04.712,00:41:07.506,We're just being consistent with their policies.
00:41:07.506,00:41:09.717,"Well, with all respect, sir, they were bad policies."
00:41:09.717,00:41:13.179,"Right, thanks, Alex."
00:41:13.179,00:41:17.434,"Let's, um, move on, shall we?"
00:41:19.936,00:41:25.275,"Well, now, that was, uh, an interesting day."
00:41:25.275,00:41:32.115,"Sorry if our line was firm, but there's no point in tiptoeing around today and then just disappointing you for four years."
00:41:32.115,00:41:36.161,"- I mean, I have plans and I plan to see them through."
00:41:36.161,00:41:39.747,"Now, there is one final thing I think we should look at."
00:41:39.747,00:41:41.416,If you just give me a second.
00:41:41.416,00:41:47.422,"I'll give you anything you ask for, as long as it's not something I don't wanna give."
00:41:52.010,00:41:53.970,Hi.
00:41:53.970,00:41:56.097,Pathetic.
00:42:16.617,00:42:18.495,It's great scotch.
00:42:19.745,00:42:23.791,"I'll, um-- I'll be going then."
00:42:25.584,00:42:27.962,"Uh, Natalie."
00:42:27.962,00:42:32.967,I hope to see much more of you as our two great countries work toward a better future.
00:42:32.967,00:42:35.011,"Thank you, sir."
00:42:51.027,00:42:52.862,"Uh, yes, Peter."
00:42:52.862,00:42:56.032,"Mr. President, uh, has it been a good visit?"
00:42:56.032,00:42:58.159,Very satisfactory indeed.
00:42:59.660,00:43:06.000,"We, uh, got what we came for, and our special relationship is still very special."
00:43:06.000,00:43:08.336,And Prime Minister?
00:43:08.336,00:43:12.215,I love that word relationship.
00:43:12.215,00:43:16.677,I fear that this has become a bad relationship.
00:43:16.677,00:43:21.099,A relationship based on the president taking exactly what he wants...
00:43:21.099,00:43:24.894,and casually ignoring all those things...
00:43:24.894,00:43:31.817,"that really matter to, um, Britain."
00:43:31.817,00:43:36.072,"We may be a small country, but we're a great one too."
00:43:36.072,00:43:45.664,"The country of Shakespeare, Churchill, the Beatles, Sean Connery, Harry Potter-- David Beckham's right foot."
00:43:45.664,00:43:49.001,"David Beckham's left foot, come to that."
00:43:49.001,00:43:51.754,And a friend who bullies us...
00:43:51.754,00:43:58.595,"And since bullies only respond to strength, from now onward I will be prepared to be much stronger."
00:43:58.595,00:44:01.473,And the president should be prepared for that.
00:44:11.608,00:44:13.692,Mr. President.
00:44:18.823,00:44:21.200,Joe.
00:44:21.200,00:44:24.870,It's your sister on line four.
00:44:24.870,00:44:26.789,All right.
00:44:26.789,00:44:29.501,"Uh, yes, I'm very busy and important."
00:44:29.501,00:44:31.586,Have you gone completely insane?
00:44:31.586,00:44:35.006,Can't be sensible all the time.
00:44:35.006,00:44:38.343,"-Oh, dear, the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the other line."
00:44:38.343,00:44:40.512,I'll call you back.
00:44:38.343,00:44:45.141,"No, you won't. You're-- The trouble with being the prime minister's sister..."
00:44:45.141,00:44:47.519,is it does put your life into rather harsh perspective.
00:44:47.519,00:44:50.563,What did my brother do today?
00:44:50.563,00:44:54.275,He stood up and fought for his country.
00:44:54.275,00:44:56.693,I made a papier-mâché lobster head.
00:44:56.693,00:45:01.407,What is this we're listening to?
00:45:01.407,00:45:04.619,I can't believe you still listen to Joni Mitchell.
00:45:04.619,00:45:09.374,"I love her, and true love lasts a lifetime."
00:45:09.374,00:45:14.379,Joni Mitchell is the woman who taught your cold English wife how to feel.
00:45:14.379,00:45:16.422,Did she?
00:45:16.422,00:45:20.259,I must write to her sometime and say thanks.
00:45:20.259,00:45:22.719,"Now, which doll shall we give Daisy's little friend Emily?"
00:45:22.719,00:45:28.100,The one that looks like a transvestite or the one that looks like a dominatrix?
00:45:28.100,00:45:31.145,It's almost enough to make you feel patriotic.
00:45:31.145,00:45:35.066,So here's one for our arse-kicking prime minister.
00:45:35.066,00:45:38.361,A golden oldie for a golden oldie.
00:45:47.245,00:46:31.289,"I can feel you ever gone before If you wanna taste Yeah. Um-- Mary, I've been thinking."
00:46:31.289,00:46:34.875,Can we move the Japanese ambassador to 4:00 tomorrow?
00:46:34.875,00:46:38.504,"- Certainly, sir."
00:46:45.720,00:46:49.766,"Um, would you like the last, uh-- Thank you very much..."
00:46:49.766,00:46:51.350,but no.
00:46:51.350,00:46:53.269,"If you saw my sister, you'd understand why."
00:46:53.269,00:46:55.271,That's all right.
00:46:55.271,00:46:56.897,Just don't go eating it all yourself.
00:46:56.897,00:46:59.275,you're getting chubbier every day.
00:46:59.275,00:47:03.279,I'm very lucky. I've got one of those constitutions where I never put on weight.
00:47:03.279,00:47:05.406,Oh.
00:47:05.406,00:47:07.533,Hello?
00:47:16.459,00:47:18.961,Oop. Sorry.
00:47:22.089,00:47:24.049,Hello?
00:47:39.732,00:47:41.984,- Thank you.
00:47:41.984,00:47:45.780,"- Oh, no. Oh, no."
00:47:45.780,00:47:50.075,"Oh, God, it's half the book."
00:47:50.075,00:47:53.954,"Please, they're not important."
00:47:53.954,00:47:56.332,"Uh, stop!"
00:47:56.332,00:47:58.751,Stop.
00:48:00.461,00:48:03.381,It's all just rubbish!
00:48:05.424,00:48:07.426,Just leave it.
00:48:19.438,00:48:22.734,"- Oh, God, she's in."
00:48:22.734,00:48:26.654,"Right, and now she'll think I'm a total spaz if I don't go in too."
00:48:27.655,00:48:30.616,"Fuck, it's cold!"
00:48:33.285,00:48:35.996,Fuck! It's freezing! Fuck!
00:48:35.996,00:48:39.375,This stuff better be good.
00:48:39.375,00:48:42.837,"It's not worth it, you know."
00:48:42.837,00:48:47.717,I don't want to drown saving some shit my grandmother could have written.
00:48:47.717,00:48:49.093,"Just stop, stop."
00:48:49.093,00:48:52.054,What kind of idiot doesn't make copies?
00:48:52.054,00:48:54.599,I really must do copies.
00:48:54.599,00:48:57.518,"You know, there'd better not be eels in here. I can't stand eels."
00:48:57.518,00:49:00.730,Try not to disturb the eels.
00:49:00.730,00:49:02.732,"Oh, God! What the hell is that?"
00:49:12.658,00:49:14.285,Thank you.
00:49:19.540,00:49:22.376,I know. I'll name one of the characters after you.
00:49:22.376,00:49:27.757,Maybe you could name one of the characters after me.
00:49:27.757,00:49:30.927,Or give me 50 percent of the profits.
00:49:30.927,00:49:34.305,Or I could give you 5 percent of the profits.
00:49:36.140,00:49:39.769,What kind of book is it?
00:49:41.604,00:49:50.195,"Or, um-- Or, um, uh, romance?"
00:49:50.195,00:49:56.577,"Ah-ah! Ah, yes, it's, um, uh-- Thriller... crime?"
00:49:56.577,00:49:58.621,"Yes, uh, sí, crime."
00:49:58.621,00:50:01.666,"Crime. Uh, murder, you know."
00:50:01.666,00:50:03.459,Frightening?
00:50:03.459,00:50:06.671,"Uh, scary?"
00:50:06.671,00:50:08.923,"And, uh, sometimes not."
00:50:08.923,00:50:11.175,Mainly scary how bad the writing is.
00:50:24.605,00:50:28.526,I'd better get back to work.
00:50:28.526,00:50:29.861,Ah.
00:50:29.861,00:50:32.279,And then later you'll drive me home?
00:50:32.279,00:50:33.865,"Sure, sure."
00:50:37.743,00:50:42.957,It's my favorite time of day-- driving you.
00:50:45.083,00:50:49.755,"It's the saddest part of my day, leaving you."
00:50:55.260,00:50:57.137,Oh.
00:51:24.456,00:51:27.668,"And coming up later this morning, it's this guy."
00:51:32.924,00:51:37.302,The bad granddad of rock and roll here at 10:30.
00:51:37.302,00:51:40.222,Do not switch off.
00:51:44.643,00:51:46.311,Banoffee pie?
00:51:46.311,00:51:49.732,"No, thanks."
00:51:49.732,00:51:52.234,You would have broken my heart if you'd said yes.
00:51:52.234,00:51:55.780,"Oh, right. Well, lucky you."
00:51:55.780,00:51:57.364,Can I come in?
00:51:57.364,00:52:04.580,"Uh, yeah, well, I'm a bit busy, but-- Well, I was just passing, and I thought we might check that video thing out."
00:52:04.580,00:52:10.002,I thought I might be able to swap it for some pie or maybe Munchies?
00:52:10.002,00:52:12.504,"Actually, I was being serious."
00:52:12.504,00:52:17.593,"I'll have a poke around tonight-- Mark, can I say something?"
00:52:17.593,00:52:20.429,Yeah.
00:52:20.429,00:52:23.223,I know you're Peter's best friend.
00:52:23.223,00:52:25.851,And...
00:52:25.851,00:52:28.395,I know you've never particularly warmed to me.
00:52:28.395,00:52:31.147,"Look, don't-- don't argue."
00:52:31.147,00:52:36.194,"We've never got friendly, but I just wanted to say I hope that can change."
00:52:36.194,00:52:39.698,I'm nice.
00:52:39.698,00:52:41.742,And...
00:52:41.742,00:52:44.996,it would be great if we could be friends.
00:52:44.996,00:52:47.957,Absolutely. Absolutely.
00:52:50.751,00:52:53.169,Great.
00:52:53.169,00:52:56.048,Doesn't mean we'll be able to find the video though.
00:52:56.048,00:53:03.179,"I had a real search when you first called and couldn't find any trace of it, so-- Well, there's one here that says Peter and Juliet's wedding."
00:53:03.179,00:53:07.601,Do you think we might be on the right track?
00:53:03.179,00:53:10.186,"Oh, yeah, well-- Wow. That-- That could be it."
00:53:10.186,00:53:12.397,- Do you mind if I just-- - I've probably taped over it.
00:53:12.397,00:53:16.027,Almost everything has episodes of West Wing on it now.
00:53:17.235,00:53:18.779,Oh.
00:53:20.865,00:53:23.159,"Oh, bingo."
00:53:24.242,00:53:26.745,That's lovely.
00:53:26.745,00:53:28.789,"Well done, you."
00:53:30.082,00:53:34.003,"Oh, that's gorgeous."
00:53:34.003,00:53:37.673,"Thank you so much, Mark."
00:53:45.056,00:53:48.059,I look quite pretty.
00:53:53.772,00:53:56.859,"You've stayed rather close, haven't you?"
00:54:50.579,00:54:52.288,They're all of me.
00:54:57.044,00:55:00.380,Yeah. Yeah.
00:55:00.380,00:55:02.382,Yes.
00:55:32.579,00:55:35.457,But...
00:55:35.457,00:55:38.127,you never talk to me.
00:55:40.378,00:55:42.589,You always talk to Peter.
00:55:44.925,00:55:48.137,You don't like me.
00:55:48.137,00:55:50.264,I hope it's useful.
00:55:50.264,00:55:53.349,Don't show it around too much.
00:55:53.349,00:55:56.394,It needs a bit of editing.
00:55:56.394,00:56:00.524,"Look, I've gotta get to a lunch."
00:56:00.524,00:56:02.442,Early lunch.
00:56:02.442,00:56:05.321,"You can just show yourself out, can't you?"
00:56:10.909,00:56:16.414,It's a...
00:57:14.139,00:57:15.891,Yeah.
00:57:19.353,00:57:23.481,"Annie, my darling, my dream, my boat."
00:57:23.481,00:57:27.319,"Uh, need you to do a favor for me."
00:57:27.319,00:57:31.990,Of course. Anything for the hero of the hour.
00:57:31.990,00:57:35.327,"Don't ask me why, and for heaven's sake, don't read stuff into this."
00:57:35.327,00:57:37.829,It's just a weird personality thing.
00:57:37.829,00:57:40.958,"But, um, you know Natalie who works here?"
00:57:40.958,00:57:45.629,- The chubby girl?
00:57:45.629,00:57:50.426,"I think there's a pretty sizable arse there, yes, sir."
00:57:50.426,00:58:04.022,"Yeah. Well, whatever. Um-- I'm sure she's a lovely girl, but I wonder if you could, um, redistribute her."
00:58:05.107,00:58:07.567,It's done.
00:58:41.477,00:58:44.396,"Hey, Sammo. Can't sleep?"
00:58:44.396,00:58:47.316,I got some terrible news today.
00:58:47.316,00:58:51.153,Let's have it.
00:58:51.153,00:58:54.990,- Your girl's American?
00:58:54.990,00:58:57.326,And she's not my girl.
00:58:57.326,00:59:01.121,And she's going back to America.
00:59:01.121,00:59:03.957,That is bad news.
00:59:05.959,00:59:11.923,"Well, we need Kate and we need Leo, and we need them now."
00:59:11.923,00:59:13.758,Come on.
00:59:17.346,00:59:19.556,Hold on. Hold on.
00:59:19.556,00:59:21.975,Keep your eyes closed.
00:59:21.975,00:59:23.977,Do you trust me?
00:59:23.977,00:59:27.189,I trust you.
00:59:27.189,00:59:29.733,Do you trust me?
00:59:29.733,00:59:32.736,Fool!
00:59:35.113,00:59:37.615,All right.
00:59:41.453,00:59:46.250,"Well, you know, Sammy, I'm sure she's unique and extraordinary, but..."
00:59:46.250,00:59:50.712,"general wisdom is that, in the end, there isn't just one person for each of us."
00:59:52.630,00:59:54.883,There was for Kate and Leo.
00:59:54.883,00:59:57.511,There was for you.
00:59:57.511,01:00:01.639,And there is for me.
01:00:03.058,01:00:06.144,Fair enough.
01:00:06.144,01:00:09.440,"Yeah, I know."
01:00:19.533,01:00:22.077,Yeah.
01:00:25.705,01:00:29.501,Prime Minister.
01:00:43.974,01:00:47.102,"Oh, apolo-- apologia."
01:00:47.102,01:00:49.480,"Grande, uh-- Uh, grande familio."
01:00:49.480,01:00:52.399,Grande tradizione di Christmas presents.
01:00:52.399,01:00:54.610,Stupido.
01:01:20.511,01:01:23.305,"Well, goodbye."
01:01:23.305,01:01:26.141,Thank you.
01:01:28.435,01:01:34.732,"Um, it was, um-- I will miss you."
01:01:36.067,01:01:40.030,And your very slow typing...
01:01:40.030,01:01:43.367,and your very bad driving.
01:03:10.828,01:03:12.872,Daniel!
01:03:14.625,01:03:18.836,- I have a plan.
01:03:18.836,01:03:22.132,"Well, girls love musicians, don't they?"
01:03:22.132,01:03:24.926,Even the really weird ones get girlfriends.
01:03:24.926,01:03:27.178,Meat Loaf definitely got laid at least once.
01:03:27.178,01:03:31.433,"For God's sake, Ringo Starr married a Bond girl."
01:03:31.433,01:03:35.395,"Whatever. There's this big concert at the end of term, and Joanna's in it."
01:03:35.395,01:03:39.023,And I thought maybe if I was in the band and played absolutely superbly...
01:03:39.023,01:03:41.693,there's a chance that she might actually fall in love with me.
01:03:41.693,01:03:44.195,- What do you think?
01:03:44.195,01:03:49.284,"I think it's stellar, apart from the one obvious, tiny, little-baby, little hiccup."
01:03:49.284,01:03:52.746,- That I don't play a musical instrument?
01:03:52.746,01:03:55.624,"A tiny, insignificant detail."
01:04:32.536,01:04:35.789,"Anyway, I suppose I'd better go and do the duty round."
01:04:35.789,01:04:37.290,You're a saint.
01:04:45.173,01:04:48.677,Any chance of a dance with the boss?
01:04:48.677,01:04:51.012,"Yeah, sure, sure."
01:04:51.012,01:04:53.557,As long as your boyfriend doesn't mind.
01:04:56.226,01:04:58.353,Not my boyfriend.
01:05:13.451,01:05:16.079,You're looking very pretty tonight.
01:05:17.748,01:05:21.125,It's for you.
01:05:21.125,01:05:23.461,Sorry?
01:05:25.714,01:05:28.884,"It's all for you, sir."
01:05:50.238,01:05:55.034,"This must be a very exciting moment for you, fighting for the Christmas number one."
01:05:55.034,01:05:58.204,How's it looking so far?
01:05:58.204,01:06:04.669,"Blue are outselling me five to one, but I'm hoping for a late surge."
01:06:04.669,01:06:14.554,"And if I reach number one, I promise to sing a song - stark naked on TV on Christmas Eve."
01:06:14.554,01:06:17.056,- Do you mean that?
01:06:17.056,01:06:20.769,"- Do you want a preview, you old flirt?"
01:06:23.187,01:06:26.149,That'll never make number one.
01:06:32.948,01:06:36.743,"I suppose it's his job to dance with everyone, isn't it?"
01:06:36.743,01:06:39.078,Some more than others.
01:06:42.081,01:06:47.587,Just one dance...
01:06:47.587,01:06:50.882,"Unless you, you just-- No, no."
01:06:50.882,01:06:53.343,Good. Yes.
01:06:53.343,01:06:55.386,Thanks.
01:08:23.016,01:08:25.268,"Well, I-- I'd better go."
01:08:25.268,01:08:27.395,Okay.
01:08:28.646,01:08:31.066,Good night.
01:08:47.916,01:08:50.877,"Actually, I don't have to go."
01:08:50.877,01:08:52.879,Right. Good.
01:08:50.877,01:08:55.632,"I-I mean-- No, no."
01:08:55.632,01:08:59.427,"Just, um-- Would you ex-excuse me for one second?"
01:08:59.427,01:09:02.722,Just one-- one second.
01:09:09.437,01:09:12.231,"Um, okay. That's done."
01:09:12.231,01:09:18.029,Um-- Why don't you come upstairs in about 10 seconds?
01:09:18.029,01:09:20.406,Ten seconds?
01:10:20.800,01:10:23.344,Just tug it.
01:10:44.448,01:10:48.244,You're beautiful.
01:11:11.101,01:11:13.477,I-- I'd-- I'd better answer that.
01:11:17.065,01:11:20.568,Hello?
01:11:20.568,01:11:24.822,"No, no, I'm not busy."
01:11:24.822,01:11:26.699,Right.
01:11:26.699,01:11:46.010,"Yes, I-- I-- I-- I'm not quite sure it's gonna be possible to get the pope on the phone tonight, but-- Yes. Yes, I-I'm-- I'm sure he's-he's very good at exorcism, but-- Well, I'm-I'm sure..."
01:11:46.010,01:11:50.098,"Jon Bon Jovi is as well, and I'll definitely look into it."
01:11:50.098,01:11:53.768,"Okay? Okay, I'll-I'll talk to you later."
01:11:53.768,01:11:55.979,All right. Bye-bye.
01:12:00.942,01:12:03.111,Sorry about that.
01:12:03.111,01:12:05.113,"No, it's-- it's fine."
01:12:05.113,01:12:08.283,It's my brother.
01:12:10.034,01:12:11.953,I'm sorry.
01:12:11.953,01:12:15.165,"It's fine. I mean, it's-it's not really... fine."
01:12:15.165,01:12:21.712,"It is what it is, and-- Sort of there being no parents now, and us being over here, it's my job to keep an eye on him."
01:12:21.712,01:12:25.091,"I mean, not my job."
01:12:25.091,01:12:26.676,That's okay.
01:12:26.676,01:12:30.180,"I mean, life is full of interruptions and complications."
01:12:32.723,01:12:54.578,So-- Will it make him better?
01:12:54.578,01:12:56.580,No.
01:12:56.580,01:12:59.167,Then maybe...
01:12:59.167,01:13:01.294,don't answer?
01:13:08.801,01:13:12.096,Hey. How you doin'? Hmm.
01:13:12.096,01:13:14.057,"Right, right."
01:13:14.057,01:13:17.768,"Oh, no. Oh, please."
01:13:17.768,01:13:23.191,"I-- Between the two of us, we'll find the answer, and it won't hurt anymore."
01:13:23.191,01:13:28.905,"No, no."
01:13:28.905,01:13:32.116,"Of course, if you want me to come over, I will."
01:13:32.116,01:13:35.411,Mm-hmm. Okay.
01:13:45.046,01:13:49.466,"That was a good night, except I felt fat."
01:13:49.466,01:13:52.262,Don't be ridiculous.
01:13:52.262,01:13:56.432,"Nowadays, the only clothes I can get into were once owned by Pavarotti."
01:13:56.432,01:14:00.603,I always think Pavarotti dresses very well.
01:14:03.064,01:14:05.316,Mia's very pretty.
01:14:07.110,01:14:09.279,Is she?
01:14:10.321,01:14:12.823,"You know she is, darling."
01:14:12.823,01:14:15.410,Be careful there.
01:14:38.808,01:14:41.018,Have you been watching stuff on TV?
01:14:43.271,01:14:45.689,Yeah.
01:14:45.689,01:14:47.775,Every night.
01:14:47.775,01:14:49.777,And every day.
01:14:56.909,01:15:00.704,The nurses are trying to kill me.
01:15:07.962,01:15:10.131,Thank you.
01:15:13.426,01:15:15.636,"Don't do that, my darling."
01:15:16.720,01:15:19.098,Thank you.
01:15:26.522,01:15:28.816,Don't do that.
01:16:01.557,01:16:06.145,Right. Back at 3.
01:16:06.145,01:16:09.148,Are you gonna get me something?
01:16:09.148,01:16:16.739,Uh-- I don't know. I hadn't thought.
01:16:16.739,01:16:19.575,She couldn't make it in today.
01:16:19.575,01:16:23.371,There's a word for hangover I've never heard before.
01:16:23.371,01:16:27.624,- See you later.
01:16:30.669,01:16:33.047,A lot.
01:16:44.975,01:16:47.311,So are you gonna give me something?
01:16:47.311,01:16:50.898,I thought I made it clear last night.
01:16:50.898,01:16:54.485,"When it comes to me, you can have everything."
01:16:54.485,01:16:59.282,"So, um, what do you need?"
01:16:59.282,01:17:03.702,Something along the stationery line?
01:17:03.702,01:17:07.123,No. I don't want something I need.
01:17:07.123,01:17:10.751,I want something I want.
01:17:10.751,01:17:13.087,Right.
01:17:14.880,01:17:17.091,Right.
01:17:23.973,01:17:27.560,Sorry I'm late.
01:17:31.855,01:17:37.694,"Right. Well, listen, you keep yourself occupied for 10 minutes while I go and do the boring stuff for our mothers."
01:17:55.796,01:17:58.633,How about this one?
01:17:58.633,01:18:00.593,- Perhaps. I'll think about it.
01:18:00.593,01:18:01.927,Thank you.
01:18:01.927,01:18:04.597,"Looking for anything in particular, sir?"
01:18:04.597,01:18:07.808,"Yes, um-- That necklace there."
01:18:07.808,01:18:10.727,It's £270.
01:18:12.104,01:18:14.357,"Um, all right."
01:18:14.357,01:18:16.192,Lovely.
01:18:19.111,01:18:22.281,Would you like it...
01:18:22.281,01:18:25.159,"- Uh, yes. All right."
01:18:27.828,01:18:31.415,Let me just pop it in the box.
01:18:31.415,01:18:32.958,There.
01:18:32.958,01:18:35.752,"Look, could we be quite quick?"
01:18:35.752,01:18:40.174,"Certainly, sir."
01:18:46.722,01:18:49.350,- There.
01:18:49.350,01:18:54.063,Not quite finished.
01:18:54.063,01:18:58.067,"Look, actually, I don't need a bag."
01:18:58.067,01:19:01.487,"- Oh, this isn't a bag, sir."
01:19:01.487,01:19:03.906,This is so much more than a bag.
01:19:10.120,01:19:11.914,Ooh.
01:19:25.595,01:19:29.473,"Could we be quite quick, please?"
01:19:29.473,01:19:32.309,Prontissimo.
01:19:50.536,01:19:53.289,- What's that?
01:19:53.289,01:19:56.959,"- Actually, I really, uh, can't wait."
01:19:56.959,01:19:59.295,Wanna bet?
01:19:59.295,01:20:02.131,'Tis but the work of a moment.
01:20:04.174,01:20:07.470,There we go.
01:20:07.470,01:20:09.346,Almost finished?
01:20:09.346,01:20:12.015,Are you gonna dip it in yogurt?
01:20:12.015,01:20:15.185,"Oh, no, sir."
01:20:15.185,01:20:18.606,- I don't want a Christmas box.
01:20:18.606,01:20:20.816,"- I did, but-- - This is the final flourish."
01:20:20.816,01:20:23.026,- Can I just pay?
01:20:20.816,01:20:26.071,"- All we need now-- - Oh, God!"
01:20:26.071,01:20:28.658,- No. No. No. No.
01:20:26.071,01:20:31.368,"- But, sir, the-- Leave it, leave it, just leave it."
01:20:31.368,01:20:33.954,"Loitering around the jewelry section, I see."
01:20:33.954,01:20:38.167,- I was just looking around.
01:20:33.954,01:20:41.837,"- Don't worry. My expectations are not that high after 13 years of Mr. Oh, But You Always Love Scarves."
01:20:41.837,01:20:44.173,"Actually, I do love this one."
01:20:53.516,01:20:58.145,Hey!
01:20:58.145,01:21:01.190,Had to rent out my flat to pay for my ticket.
01:21:01.190,01:21:04.735,You're not actually going ahead with this genuinely stupid plan?
01:21:04.735,01:21:06.570,"Yeah, I bloody am."
01:21:06.570,01:21:09.865,You think this backpack is full of clothes?
01:21:09.865,01:21:12.993,It is chockablock full of condoms.
01:21:12.993,01:21:16.497,"Excellent, excellent."
01:21:16.497,01:21:25.255,"Look, um, sorry to be, uh, a bit forward and all that, but, uh, you don't fancy going for a Christmas drink, do you?"
01:21:25.255,01:21:27.424,"I mean, nothing-- you know, nothing implied at all."
01:21:27.424,01:21:32.971,"Just, um, maybe sort of go and see something Christmassy or-or-or-or something?"
01:21:32.971,01:21:35.391,"Uh, obviously, if you don't want to, you don't have to."
01:21:35.391,01:21:38.101,"I was just, you know-- I'm-I'm rambling now. Sorry."
01:21:38.101,01:21:41.104,No.
01:21:41.104,01:21:44.024,Oh! Great.
01:21:45.984,01:21:47.152,Yay!
01:21:47.152,01:21:49.405,"You know, that is really great."
01:21:49.405,01:21:51.574,"Normally, I'm really shy about this sort of thing."
01:21:51.574,01:21:54.326,"Takes me ages to get the courage up, so thank you."
01:22:00.082,01:22:03.836,Explain to me again why you're so late?
01:22:03.836,01:22:07.339,Can't a man have any secrets?
01:22:07.339,01:22:12.595,It's the first-ever preview.
01:22:19.852,01:22:26.650,"It was a starry night in ancient Jerusalem, and the baby Jesus was in his manger."
01:22:34.658,01:22:38.454,Sherlock Holmes is not a real detective.
01:22:41.290,01:22:45.753,I would like half-pint of churly.
01:22:45.753,01:22:48.338,I would like a one-day travel card.
01:22:48.338,01:22:51.425,"Oh, my God, I've got a terrible stomach ache."
01:22:51.425,01:22:54.637,It must have been the prawns.
01:22:54.637,01:22:57.222,Milton Keynes has many roundabout.
01:22:57.222,01:23:03.186,"My goodness, this is a very big fish!"
01:23:03.186,01:23:05.689,It tastes delicious!
01:23:20.412,01:23:23.165,You'll come back a broken man.
01:23:23.165,01:23:25.292,Back broken...
01:23:25.292,01:23:27.753,You are on the road to disaster.
01:23:27.753,01:23:31.381,"No. I am on shag highway, heading west."
01:23:31.381,01:23:34.426,"Farewell, failure."
01:23:34.426,01:23:37.888,"America, watch out!"
01:23:34.426,01:23:54.822,"Here comes Colin Frissell, Take me to a bar."
01:23:54.822,01:23:58.367,Just any bar.
01:24:05.415,01:24:08.627,Can I help you?
01:24:08.627,01:24:10.921,King of beers.
01:24:10.921,01:24:14.633,- One Bud coming up.
01:24:15.885,01:24:20.472,- Are you from England?
01:24:20.472,01:24:24.977,Oh! That is so cute.
01:24:24.977,01:24:26.937,"Hi, I'm Stacey."
01:24:28.146,01:24:29.732,Jeannie?
01:24:32.651,01:24:34.820,Yeah?
01:24:34.820,01:24:37.740,This is-- Colin.
01:24:39.199,01:24:41.493,Frissell.
01:24:41.493,01:24:43.537,Cute name.
01:24:43.537,01:24:46.540,Jeannie.
01:24:46.540,01:24:48.751,Yep. Basildon.
01:24:48.751,01:24:51.670,Oh.
01:24:51.670,01:24:54.840,Wait till Carol-Anne gets here.
01:24:54.840,01:24:56.759,She's crazy about English guys.
01:24:56.759,01:24:58.969,Uh-huh.
01:25:01.805,01:25:05.768,"- Hey, girls."
01:25:05.768,01:25:08.687,He's from England.
01:25:08.687,01:25:13.525,"Well, step aside, ladies."
01:25:15.360,01:25:18.739,"- Hey, gorgeous."
01:25:20.323,01:25:23.035,That is so funny.
01:25:23.035,01:25:26.789,What-What do you call that?
01:25:26.789,01:25:29.416,Bottle.
01:25:29.416,01:25:32.294,"Uh, straw."
01:25:32.294,01:25:35.422,What about this?
01:25:35.422,01:25:37.883,Table.
01:25:37.883,01:25:41.303,- Where are you staying?
01:25:41.303,01:25:44.222,"I guess I'll just check into a motel, like they do in the movies."
01:25:44.222,01:25:46.934,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
01:25:46.934,01:25:48.602,"No, no, no. Listen."
01:25:48.602,01:25:52.147,"This may be a bit pushy 'cause we just met you, but..."
01:25:52.147,01:25:54.483,why don't you come back and sleep at our place?
01:25:54.483,01:25:56.777,Yeah.
01:25:56.777,01:26:00.030,"Um, well, I mean, you know, if it's not too much of an inconvenience."
01:26:00.030,01:26:03.283,"Hell, no."
01:26:03.283,01:26:08.580,- What?
01:26:03.283,01:26:13.794,"- Well, we're not the richest of girls, you know, so we just have..."
01:26:13.794,01:26:17.714,Oh.
01:26:17.714,01:26:24.179,"And on this cold, cold night, it's... gonna be crowded and sweaty and stuff."
01:26:24.179,01:26:27.057,And we can't even afford pajamas.
01:26:27.057,01:26:29.476,No?
01:26:29.476,01:26:33.939,Which means...
01:26:38.318,01:26:40.612,"No. No, I think it'll be fine."
01:26:40.612,01:26:43.115,Good.
01:26:43.115,01:26:48.495,The thing that's gonna make it more crowded-- Harriet.
01:26:48.495,01:26:52.708,- There's a fourth one?
01:26:48.495,01:26:54.793,- Don't worry. You're totally gonna like her 'cause she is the sexy one.
01:26:54.793,01:26:57.629,Really? Wow.
01:26:57.629,01:27:01.633,- Praise the Lord.
01:27:03.760,01:27:05.679,Cheers.
01:27:26.658,01:27:30.579,One present only each tonight.
01:27:30.579,01:27:32.998,"- No, let Mummy go first."
01:27:32.998,01:27:37.627,"No, no, no, no, no."
01:27:39.504,01:27:43.217,- this one.
01:27:39.504,01:27:47.512,"- I have, of course bought the traditional scarf as well, but this is my other..."
01:27:47.512,01:27:49.848,Thank you.
01:27:49.848,01:27:51.725,That's a real first.
01:27:51.725,01:27:54.394,Rip it.
01:27:54.394,01:27:57.272,"I'm going to-- All right, I'll rip it."
01:28:03.612,01:28:06.031,"God, that's a surprise."
01:28:06.031,01:28:09.118,What is it?
01:28:10.911,01:28:14.623,It's a CD.
01:28:14.623,01:28:19.128,To continue your emotional education.
01:28:19.128,01:28:23.381,Goodness.
01:28:23.381,01:28:28.971,My brilliant wife.
01:28:28.971,01:28:33.349,"Actually, um, do you mind if I just absent myself for a second?"
01:28:33.349,01:28:36.478,All that ice cream.
01:28:33.349,01:28:39.731,"Uh-- Darling, could you just make sure the kids are ready to go?"
01:28:39.731,01:28:43.110,I'll be back in a minute.
01:30:40.018,01:30:43.521,"Oh, my God!"
01:30:43.521,01:30:45.982,It's a miracle!
01:30:45.982,01:30:49.403,You're all dressed-- Come on. We're horribly late.
01:30:49.403,01:30:53.907,Out you go.
01:31:03.541,01:31:07.087,Has she noticed you yet?
01:31:07.087,01:31:11.341,But you know the thing about romance is people only get together right at the very end.
01:31:11.341,01:31:14.844,Of course.
01:31:14.844,01:31:18.681,"By the way, I feel bad."
01:31:18.681,01:31:22.727,No.
01:31:22.727,01:31:27.190,"As you know, that was a done deal long ago."
01:31:27.190,01:31:34.281,"Unless, of course, Claudia Schiffer calls, in which case I want you out of the house straightaway, you wee motherless mongrel."
01:31:34.281,01:31:39.828,Oh!
01:31:39.828,01:31:47.210,"Christmas Eve all over the U.K., and the big question is: Who is number one on the Radio One Chart Show tonight?"
01:31:47.210,01:31:51.173,Is it Blue or the unexpected Christmas sensation from Billy Mack?
01:31:51.173,01:31:55.093,"Well, you might have guessed it, although you may not believe it."
01:31:55.093,01:31:59.806,- It's Billy Mack!
01:31:59.806,01:32:01.391,You are the champion!
01:32:01.391,01:32:04.518,"Hi, Billy."
01:32:04.518,01:32:08.357,"We're live across the nation, and you're number one."
01:32:08.357,01:32:10.984,- How will you be celebrating?
01:32:10.984,01:32:24.789,"Uh, either I could behave like a real rock and roll loser and get drunk with my fat manager, or-- when I hang up I'll be flooded by invitations to a large number of glamorous parties."
01:32:24.789,01:32:27.917,Let's hope it's the latter.
01:32:24.789,01:32:31.754,"And here it is, number one from Billy Mack, it's Christmas Is All Around."
01:32:35.008,01:32:38.428,Bill.
01:32:38.428,01:32:42.224,Hello.
01:32:42.224,01:32:44.558,Of-Of course.
01:32:44.558,01:32:47.187,"Send an embarrassingly big car, and I'll be there."
01:32:49.814,01:32:53.609,It's gonna be a very good Christmas.
01:33:00.742,01:33:04.454,Right.
01:33:04.454,01:33:06.415,"My mum and, you know-- Of course. Yeah."
01:33:06.415,01:33:08.624,It's getting a bit cold.
01:33:08.624,01:33:14.047,"Um-- Well, good night."
01:33:16.758,01:33:25.392,"Uh-- Uh, okay."
01:33:39.531,01:33:43.535,All I want for Christmas...
01:33:45.995,01:33:48.664,Right.
01:33:48.664,01:33:51.876,Thank you. Good.
01:33:51.876,01:33:54.588,Good night.
01:33:54.588,01:33:58.383,Ho!
01:34:07.350,01:34:11.396,"Oh, look, everyone!"
01:34:13.523,01:34:17.068,"Yes. Oh, splendid. It's lovely-- lovely to see you all."
01:34:17.068,01:34:22.282,"And, uh, I'm off actually."
01:34:22.282,01:34:25.243,"But, Jamie, darling."
01:34:25.243,01:34:27.787,Sorry.
01:34:27.787,01:34:31.291,A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.
01:34:33.042,01:34:35.587,I hate Uncle Jamie.
01:34:49.809,01:34:54.189,"Gatwick Airport, please."
01:35:05.325,01:35:08.911,"Night, Sarah."
01:35:08.911,01:35:11.039,"Night, Karl."
01:35:11.039,01:35:19.839,"I, um-- Merry Christmas."
01:35:19.839,01:35:22.258,Merry Christmas.
01:35:41.110,01:35:44.280,"Hi, babe."
01:35:44.280,01:35:47.033,"Is it all party, party, party down there?"
01:36:04.718,01:36:07.637,"Sam, time for dinner."
01:36:07.637,01:36:12.434,I'm not hungry.
01:36:12.434,01:36:14.561,Look at the sign on the door.
01:36:19.065,01:36:20.650,Right.
01:36:26.822,01:36:29.576,It's a little long.
01:36:37.542,01:36:40.169,I'll get it.
01:36:45.675,01:36:48.928,"- Oh, hi."
01:36:53.141,01:36:57.520,It's carol singers.
01:38:09.384,01:38:13.179,Merry Christmas.
01:38:49.006,01:38:51.885,Enough.
01:38:51.885,01:38:53.969,Enough now.
01:39:01.477,01:39:03.937,What the hell are you doing here?
01:39:03.937,01:39:05.939,"I mean, you're supposed to be at Elton John's."
01:39:05.939,01:39:11.362,"Yeah, well, I was there for a minute or two, and then-- and then I had an epiphany."
01:39:11.362,01:39:13.615,Really?
01:39:13.615,01:39:16.785,"Well, come on."
01:39:16.785,01:39:20.162,"So, um, what was this epiphany?"
01:39:20.162,01:39:24.459,"- Um, it was about Christmas."
01:39:24.459,01:39:30.005,No. I realized that Christmas is the time to be with the people you love.
01:39:30.005,01:39:31.549,Right.
01:39:31.549,01:39:49.275,"And I realized that as dire chance and-and fateful cock-up would have it, here I am-- mid-fifties-- and without knowing it, I've gone and spent most of my adult life with a chubby employee."
01:39:49.275,01:40:01.162,"And much as it grieves me to say it, it-it might be that the people I love is, in fact, you."
01:40:02.664,01:40:07.752,"- Well, this is a surprise."
01:40:07.752,01:40:10.087,"Ten minutes at Elton John's, you're as gay as a maypole."
01:40:10.087,01:40:12.340,"No, look, I'm serious here."
01:40:12.340,01:40:23.810,"I left Elton's, where there were a hefty number of half-naked chicks with their mouths open in order to hang out with you at Christmas."
01:40:23.810,01:40:29.565,"- Well, Bill-- - It's a terrible, terrible mistake, Chubs."
01:40:33.152,01:40:36.739,But you turn out to be the fucking love of my life.
01:40:39.784,01:40:44.497,"And to be honest, despite all my..."
01:40:39.784,01:40:49.168,"complaining, we have had a wonderful life."
01:40:53.046,01:40:57.134,"Well, thank you."
01:41:00.053,01:41:02.431,"I mean, yeah, come on."
01:41:04.851,01:41:07.311,I feel very proud.
01:41:07.311,01:41:10.023,"Oh, don't-don't be a moron."
01:41:20.324,01:41:24.913,Come on. Let's get pissed and watch porn.
01:41:43.056,01:41:45.767,Dear sir. Dear David.
01:41:45.767,01:41:49.228,"Merry Christmas, and I hope you have a very happy New Year."
01:41:49.228,01:41:51.355,I'm very sorry about the thing that happened.
01:41:51.355,01:41:54.901,"It was a very odd moment, and I feel like a prize idiot."
01:41:54.901,01:41:59.530,"Particularly because, if you can't say it at Christmas, when can you, eh?"
01:41:59.530,01:42:02.283,"I'm actually yours, with love."
01:42:02.283,01:42:04.493,Your Natalie.
01:42:23.512,01:42:26.390,"Jack, yeah, I need a car."
01:42:26.390,01:42:28.101,Thank you.
01:42:39.528,01:42:41.948,"Oh, don't wait up."
01:42:45.451,01:42:48.329,I'd like to go to Wandsworth.
01:43:00.883,01:43:03.511,Harris Street.
01:43:03.511,01:43:08.516,"Oh, God. It's the longest street in the world, and I have absolutely no idea."
01:43:11.727,01:43:20.319,I can feel you - Hello. Does Natalie live here?
01:43:20.319,01:43:23.280,- Right. Fine. Thank you.
01:43:20.319,01:43:27.952,- Eh-- Uh-- Aren't you the prime minister?
01:43:27.952,01:43:31.622,"Uh, yes, in fact, I am."
01:43:31.622,01:43:33.916,- Oh!
01:43:33.916,01:43:36.752,I'm trying to get round everyone by New Year's Eve.
01:43:40.715,01:43:44.259,Ah! Hello.
01:43:44.259,01:43:46.804,"- No, she doesn't."
01:43:46.804,01:43:48.723,Are you singing carols?
01:43:48.723,01:43:52.060,"- Uh, no. No, I'm not."
01:43:52.060,01:43:54.687,Please.
01:43:56.355,01:44:00.233,"- Well, I mean, I suppose I could."
01:44:01.527,01:44:05.781,All right.
01:44:23.549,01:44:27.636,- Hello. Sorry to disturb.
01:44:27.636,01:44:31.390,No.
01:44:33.893,01:44:36.562,Ah. Brilliant.
01:44:36.562,01:44:39.565,"You're not who I think you are, are you?"
01:44:39.565,01:44:42.651,"Yes, I'm afraid I am, and I'm sorry about all the cock-ups. Not my fault."
01:44:42.651,01:44:46.655,My cabinet are absolute crap.
01:45:03.296,01:45:06.217,Ah. Hello.
01:45:06.217,01:45:08.510,"Is, uh, Natalie in?"
01:45:08.510,01:45:12.640,Where the fuck is my fucking coat?
01:45:12.640,01:45:14.809,Oh. Hello.
01:45:14.809,01:45:16.727,Hello.
01:45:16.727,01:45:20.022,"Um, this is my mum and my dad..."
01:45:20.022,01:45:22.441,and my Uncle Tony and my Auntie Glynne.
01:45:22.441,01:45:25.569,- Very nice to meet you.
01:45:22.441,01:45:27.780,"- And, um, this is the prime minister."
01:45:27.780,01:45:30.866,"Yes, we can see that, darling."
01:45:30.866,01:45:33.535,"And, um, unfortunately, we're very late."
01:45:33.535,01:45:36.747,"- It's the school Christmas concert, you see, David."
01:45:36.747,01:45:40.251,It is the first time all the local schools have joined together. Even St. Basil's.
01:45:40.251,01:45:44.213,"- Too much detail, Mum."
01:45:44.213,01:45:48.217,"Well, I..."
01:45:50.803,01:45:53.014,On some state business.
01:45:53.014,01:45:56.017,Oh.
01:45:56.017,01:45:59.436,Of course.
01:45:59.436,01:46:03.774,"Well, perhaps you should, uh, come on later, Plumpy."
01:46:03.774,01:46:06.359,"Well, listen, I don't want to make you late for the concert."
01:46:06.359,01:46:10.031,"- No, it's nothing really."
01:46:10.031,01:46:14.243,"- No, really, it doesn't matter."
01:46:14.243,01:46:16.411,"Eight is a lot of legs, David."
01:46:16.411,01:46:28.090,"Hmm. Um-- Listen, why don't I, um, give you a lift, and then we can talk about this... state business business in the car."
01:46:29.967,01:46:32.094,- Okay.
01:46:32.094,01:46:34.096,Lovely. Yes.
01:46:34.096,01:46:36.349,"Hold tight, everybody."
01:46:42.730,01:46:45.566,How far is this place?
01:46:45.566,01:46:57.286,"Ah, right. Well, uh, I just wanted to say, um, thank you for the Christmas card."
01:46:57.286,01:47:00.289,"You're welcome. Look, I'm so sorry about that day."
01:47:00.289,01:47:08.339,"I came into the room, and he slinked towards me, and there was a fire, and he's the president of the United States, and-- Nothing happened."
01:47:08.339,01:47:11.466,And I just felt like such a fool because...
01:47:11.466,01:47:14.887,I think about you all the time actually.
01:47:14.887,01:47:17.306,And I think you're the man that I really-- We're here.
01:47:17.306,01:47:19.058,love.
01:47:19.058,01:47:30.111,"Oh, wow. That really was just round the corner. Uh-- Um-- Ow!"
01:47:37.952,01:47:45.167,"Well, look, I, uh-- I think I'd better not come in, you know?"
01:47:45.167,01:47:49.046,Last thing anyone wants is some sleazy politician stealing the kids' thunder.
01:47:49.046,01:47:52.758,"No, please come."
01:47:52.758,01:47:55.510,"No, I-- I'd better not."
01:47:55.510,01:47:58.389,But I...
01:47:58.389,01:48:01.225,will be very... sorry...
01:48:01.225,01:48:03.602,to drive away from you.
01:48:04.770,01:48:08.316,Just give me one second.
01:48:20.161,01:48:24.248,John's been very mysterious.
01:48:24.248,01:48:32.047,Um-- Um-- Um-- Um-- No!
01:49:03.204,01:49:06.290,Come on in.
01:49:07.582,01:49:10.336,"Okay. Uh, Terry, I won't be long."
01:49:13.130,01:49:16.342,"Look. This, um-- This has to be a very secret visit, okay?"
01:49:16.342,01:49:19.845,"Don't worry, This was my school."
01:49:23.140,01:49:28.645,"Look, look, the sheep are ready already, and you're not even-- Oh, David!"
01:49:28.645,01:49:30.563,Ah! Ah!
01:49:30.563,01:49:34.902,"Oh, how are you? Hi, guys."
01:49:34.902,01:49:38.655,You all right?
01:49:38.655,01:49:47.122,"Well, you know, I-- I always tell your secretary's secretary's secretary that these things are going on, but it never occurred to me you'd actually turn up."
01:49:47.122,01:49:53.128,"Well, I thought it was about time I did. I just didn't want anyone to see, so I'm gonna hide myself somewhere and watch the show."
01:49:53.128,01:49:55.256,"Good luck, Daisy."
01:49:55.256,01:49:58.591,"I have to tell you, I've never been gladder to see my stupid big brother."
01:49:58.591,01:50:02.096,Thank you.
01:50:02.096,01:50:05.182,"Oh, now."
01:50:05.182,01:50:09.270,"Oh, right. Um-- Well, this is Gavin."
01:50:09.270,01:50:12.773,Sorry.
01:50:09.270,01:50:15.276,"My copper. And this is Natalie, who's my, um-- who's my, uh-- uh-- catering manager."
01:50:15.276,01:50:17.361,Oh.
01:50:17.361,01:50:19.905,Catering manager. Watch that he keeps his hands off you.
01:50:19.905,01:50:23.075,"Twenty years ago, you'd have been just his type."
01:50:23.075,01:50:26.120,"Don't try something, sir, just because it's Christmas."
01:50:27.246,01:50:29.415,"No, seriously."
01:50:29.415,01:50:31.166,"Oh, come on."
01:50:31.166,01:50:34.378,"Um, look, see you after, yeah?"
01:50:34.378,01:50:37.465,"Thank you, Prime Minister."
01:50:37.465,01:50:39.716,Come on.
01:51:13.292,01:51:17.171,Hillier School would now like to present their chosen Christmas number.
01:51:17.171,01:51:20.382,Lead vocals by 10-year-old Joanna Anderson.
01:51:20.382,01:51:25.887,"Backing vocals coordinated by her mother, the great Mrs. Jean Anderson."
01:51:25.887,01:51:32.603,"Um, some of the staff have decided to help out, and, uh, for this, we ask you to forgive us."
01:51:32.603,01:51:34.855,Thank you.
01:54:18.101,01:54:20.270,Right.
01:54:22.855,01:54:26.777,"So, not quite as secret as we'd hoped."
01:54:26.777,01:54:30.030,Smile. Little bow.
01:54:33.992,01:54:37.830,And a wave.
01:54:45.587,01:54:48.215,Wow! The prime minister.
01:54:53.261,01:54:56.306,"I'll see you later, all right?"
01:54:56.306,01:54:57.850,Bye.
01:54:59.685,01:55:04.105,"Tell me, if you were in my position, what would you do?"
01:55:04.105,01:55:06.191,What position is that?
01:55:06.191,01:55:12.947,"Imagine your husband bought a gold necklace and, come Christmas, gave it to somebody else."
01:55:12.947,01:55:16.535,"Oh, Karen."
01:55:12.947,01:55:18.953,Would you wait around to find out if it-- Good night.
01:55:18.953,01:55:29.047,"Would you wait around to find out if it's just a necklace or if it's sex and a necklace or if, worst of all, it's a necklace and love?"
01:55:29.047,01:55:34.386,"Would you stay, knowing life would always be a little bit worse?"
01:55:34.386,01:55:38.557,Or would you cut and run?
01:55:42.644,01:55:45.439,I am so in the wrong.
01:55:45.439,01:55:47.608,A classic fool.
01:55:47.608,01:55:50.861,"Yes, but you've also made a fool out of me."
01:55:50.861,01:55:54.698,You've made the life I lead foolish too.
01:55:55.949,01:55:57.325,Darling.
01:55:57.325,01:55:59.119,Whoo! Darlings!
01:55:59.119,01:56:02.414,"Oh, you were wonderful."
01:56:02.414,01:56:07.210,"My little lobster, you were so-- What is that word?"
01:56:07.210,01:56:10.004,Orange.
01:56:10.004,01:56:13.341,Come on.
01:56:13.341,01:56:16.052,Sammy!
01:56:16.052,01:56:19.514,Fantastic show!
01:56:19.514,01:56:22.350,Thanks.
01:56:22.350,01:56:24.269,"Well, tell her then."
01:56:24.269,01:56:28.565,Tell her that you love her.
01:56:28.565,01:56:30.943,Even better. Sam.
01:56:30.943,01:56:34.028,"You've got nothing to lose, and you'll always regret it if you don't."
01:56:35.489,01:56:37.825,I never told your mum enough.
01:56:37.825,01:56:43.371,I should have told her every day because she was perfect every day.
01:56:43.371,01:56:46.750,"You've seen the films, kiddo."
01:56:49.586,01:56:52.213,"Okay, Dad. Let's do it."
01:56:52.213,01:56:54.466,Let's go get the shit kicked out of us by love.
01:56:54.466,01:56:57.845,Yes!
01:56:57.845,01:56:59.262,Yeah.
01:57:00.681,01:57:03.517,"Oh, I'm sorry."
01:57:03.517,01:57:06.561,That's... okay.
01:57:06.561,01:57:08.856,"No, no, no."
01:57:08.856,01:57:10.983,"You're Sam's dad, aren't you?"
01:57:12.192,01:57:15.362,Yeah.
01:57:15.362,01:57:17.030,Daniel.
01:57:17.030,01:57:19.992,I'm Carol.
01:57:19.992,01:57:23.620,"- Okay, I'm back. Let's go."
01:57:23.620,01:57:27.541,"Well, I hope we'll meet again, Karen."
01:57:27.541,01:57:30.502,Carol.
01:57:31.753,01:57:36.466,- I'll make sure we do.
01:57:44.516,01:57:46.018,Tell her.
01:57:46.018,01:57:49.479,You know-- Don't be such an arse.
01:57:52.733,01:57:55.027,Look. There she is.
01:57:55.027,01:57:57.029,Over there.
01:57:59.364,01:58:02.409,"Oh, no."
01:58:02.409,01:58:05.537,It's okay.
01:58:20.844,01:58:22.679,Good evening.
01:58:22.679,01:58:25.557,Mr. Barros?
01:58:25.557,01:58:28.309,I am here to ask your daughter...
01:58:28.309,01:58:31.563,for her hands in marriage.
01:58:31.563,01:58:33.941,You want to marry my daughter?
01:58:33.941,01:58:35.984,Yes.
01:58:35.984,01:58:39.029,Come here.
01:58:39.029,01:58:42.741,He wants to marry you.
01:58:42.741,01:58:45.577,But I've never seen him before.
01:58:45.577,01:58:47.871,You're going to sell me to a complete stranger?
01:58:47.871,01:58:51.041,Sell? Who said sell?
01:58:51.041,01:58:52.375,Pardon me.
01:58:52.375,01:58:54.962,"I'm meaning your other daughter, Aurelia."
01:58:54.962,01:58:57.714,She's not here. She's at work.
01:58:57.714,01:59:00.717,I'll take you.
01:59:00.717,01:59:04.220,As if I would.
01:59:07.223,01:59:11.686,Father is about to sell Aurelia as a slave to this Englishman.
01:59:15.816,01:59:17.859,"Wait, wait!"
01:59:21.113,01:59:22.572,"Oh, no."
01:59:33.500,01:59:37.671,"Look, we're not actually flying, but-- You can't come through without a boarding pass."
01:59:37.671,01:59:42.216,Not even to let the boy say good-bye to the love of his life?
01:59:43.551,01:59:45.637,No.
01:59:46.763,01:59:48.765,"Uh, I'm sorry, Sam."
01:59:48.765,01:59:51.101,"Boarding pass, sir?"
01:59:51.101,01:59:54.855,"Now, just a moment. I know I've got it here somewhere. Would you mind hanging on to that?"
01:59:54.855,01:59:56.481,Unless-- What?
01:59:56.481,01:59:59.442,Do you want to make a run for it?
01:59:59.442,02:00:00.777,You think I should?
02:00:00.777,02:00:02.112,And those.
02:00:02.112,02:00:04.614,Okay.
02:00:04.614,02:00:05.866,Yes.
02:00:05.866,02:00:07.075,"No, I must have left them..."
02:00:07.075,02:00:08.785,where I was having a cup of coffee.
02:00:08.785,02:00:10.495,I'm sorry.
02:01:21.775,02:01:25.528,GIRL: Apparently he is going to kill Aurelia.
02:01:25.528,02:01:27.989,BOY: Cool!
02:02:01.856,02:02:03.984,Joanna.
02:02:05.359,02:02:07.570,Sam?
02:02:10.448,02:02:13.451,- I thought you didn't know my name.
02:02:14.828,02:02:18.706,"Oh, Jesus. Here."
02:03:10.466,02:03:12.426,Where is Aurelia?
02:03:12.426,02:03:13.678,Why should I tell you?
02:03:13.678,02:03:15.805,This man wants to marry her.
02:03:15.805,02:03:18.683,"He can't do that, she's our best waitress."
02:03:36.743,02:03:39.412,"Good evening, Aurelia."
02:03:40.872,02:03:43.041,"Good evening, Jamie."
02:03:58.056,02:04:01.101,Beautiful Aurelia...
02:04:01.101,02:04:08.900,I've come here with a view to asking you to marriage me.
02:04:08.900,02:04:16.283,I know I seems an insane person because I hardly knows you...
02:04:16.283,02:04:29.462,but sometimes things are so transparency they don't need evidential proof.
02:04:29.462,02:04:36.303,"And I will inhabit here, or you can inhabit with me in England."
02:04:36.303,02:04:38.471,"Definitely go for England, girl."
02:04:38.471,02:04:41.308,You'll meet Prince William.
02:04:41.308,02:04:43.101,Shh!
02:04:43.101,02:04:53.903,Of course I don't expecting you to be as foolish as me and of course I prediction you say no.
02:04:55.529,02:05:02.329,But it's Christmas and I just wanted to...
02:05:02.329,02:05:04.831,check.
02:05:08.001,02:05:11.712,"Oh, God, say yes, you skinny moron."
02:05:14.215,02:05:16.634,Thank you.
02:05:18.303,02:05:20.472,That will be nice.
02:05:21.931,02:05:25.518,Yes is being my answer.
02:05:27.103,02:05:29.397,Easy question.
02:05:29.397,02:05:31.107,What did you say?
02:05:31.107,02:05:33.526,"Yes, of course."
02:05:36.154,02:05:37.947,Bravo!
02:06:03.639,02:06:06.351,You learned English?
02:06:06.351,02:06:08.520,Just in cases.
02:06:49.936,02:06:52.730,"Hello, Daisy."
02:06:52.730,02:06:54.148,"Hello, Greta."
02:06:56.150,02:06:58.486,"Well, here she is."
02:06:58.486,02:07:00.613,This is Juliet. This is Peter.
02:07:00.613,02:07:03.324,Mark. Hi. Didn't see you.
02:07:03.324,02:07:06.536,Jamie's friends are so good-looking.
02:07:06.536,02:07:08.455,He never tells me this.
02:07:08.455,02:07:13.293,I think maybe now I have made the wrong choice?
02:07:13.293,02:07:16.421,She can't speak English properly. She doesn't know what she's saying.
02:07:16.421,02:07:19.632,Dad! Dad!
02:07:19.632,02:07:23.219,"Oh, God!"
02:07:23.219,02:07:26.556,Did you get us any presents?
02:07:26.556,02:07:29.100,"Thanks, Dad."
02:07:31.436,02:07:35.106,How are you?
02:07:36.441,02:07:38.859,Good to have you back.
02:07:38.859,02:07:42.322,Come on. Home.
02:07:43.739,02:07:45.783,There she is.
02:07:47.535,02:07:51.372,Hi.
02:07:51.372,02:07:53.541,Oh! He should have kissed her.
02:07:53.541,02:07:55.335,"No, that's cool."
02:07:57.420,02:07:59.672,"Hey, what are you two doing here?"
02:08:00.798,02:08:03.384,Might get a shag at last.
02:08:03.384,02:08:06.095,"Uh, gotta go."
02:08:07.138,02:08:08.973,Whoo-hoo!
02:08:11.725,02:08:14.646,"Now, this... is Harriet."
02:08:14.646,02:08:18.316,Hi.
02:08:18.316,02:08:21.444,"Hello, Harriet."
02:08:21.444,02:08:25.323,I sort of brought my sister to stay.
02:08:25.323,02:08:28.242,This is Carla.
02:08:28.242,02:08:30.578,She's real friendly.
02:08:30.578,02:08:32.997,Hello.
02:08:34.582,02:08:37.793,I heard you were gorgeous.
02:08:48.888,02:08:52.684,"God, you weigh a lot."
02:13:57.738,02:14:31.856,ever gone before If you wanna taste If you wanna taste.
