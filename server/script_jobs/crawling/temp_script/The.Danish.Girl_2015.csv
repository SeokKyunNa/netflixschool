00:52:09.751,01:52:25.363,"treated for perversion A SCIENTIFIC STUDY, OF SEXUAL IMMORALITY THE NORMAL AND ABNORMAL MAN SCHIZOPHRENIC Einar Wegener Lili Elbe's diaries became the basis of the groundbreaking memoir Man into Woman, published in 1933."
01:52:25.447,01:52:30.493,Her bravery and pioneering spirit remain an inspiration for today's transgender movement.
01:52:30.577,01:52:35.748,Gerda continued to paint portraits of Lili for the rest of her life.
01:54:20.186,00:01:39.849,"THE DANISH GIRL Oh, I'm sorry?"
00:01:40.099,00:01:42.936,"I said, don't you wish you could paint like your husband?"
00:01:43.019,00:01:46.147,Really. You must be so proud of him.
00:01:50.318,00:01:51.277,So elegant.
00:01:54.030,00:01:59.994,"Now, I don't say my client is the best landscape artist in Denmark, but he is in the top one."
00:02:00.078,00:02:01.579,"Yes. Oh, hello!"
00:02:01.663,00:02:03.373,It's going very well.
00:02:03.456,00:02:06.668,Mmm. Yes. He'll be impossible.
00:02:07.627,00:02:08.628,"Oh, my."
00:02:16.970,00:02:18.012,"Oh, thank you."
00:02:32.318,00:02:33.987,He's in the top one!
00:02:34.237,00:02:36.156,Quiet! People are sleeping.
00:03:01.723,00:03:03.558,Time you came back to bed?
00:03:03.850,00:03:04.851,No.
00:03:06.269,00:03:08.271,I'm ready to start work.
00:03:10.189,00:03:11.608,-Gerda. -What?
00:03:13.776,00:03:15.194,Your face.
00:03:17.697,00:03:19.282,You think I can't resist you?
00:03:19.574,00:03:21.451,Do you want to resist me?
00:03:23.536,00:03:24.662,No.
00:03:24.871,00:03:28.333,"But I'd like you to ask nicely, so I don't feel such a pushover."
00:03:32.420,00:03:33.838,Gerda Wegener.
00:03:36.174,00:03:37.008,My life.
00:03:39.928,00:03:41.054,My wife.
00:03:53.942,00:03:54.776,Thorbjorn.
00:03:54.859,00:03:55.985,Mr. Wegener.
00:04:15.713,00:04:16.965,Perfect.
00:04:24.430,00:04:25.640,Yes. More.
00:04:32.939,00:04:34.148,Einar Wegener.
00:04:35.275,00:04:36.567,"Oh, don't worry about him."
00:04:37.652,00:04:40.488,He's only ever had eyes for one woman.
00:04:40.822,00:04:42.365,My guilty secret's out.
00:04:44.117,00:04:47.078,"when are you two going to brood me a godchild, huh?"
00:04:47.537,00:04:48.871,"Ulla, you're an atheist."
00:04:49.080,00:04:50.623,Have you tried drinking raw eggs?
00:04:50.707,00:04:53.042,-No. -Do it. For my sake.
00:04:53.543,00:04:55.503,-We're trying. -Try harder.
00:04:55.878,00:04:57.130,Anyway...
00:05:00.091,00:05:01.592,I thought you had finished last week.
00:05:01.718,00:05:04.971,I wanted to check on the painting of the backdrop for the storm scene.
00:05:06.180,00:05:07.849,And give Gerda some space.
00:05:08.016,00:05:10.643,Ah. She's got a shy one?
00:05:11.894,00:05:13.479,"Well, you know I'm next."
00:05:17.191,00:05:18.526,I won't be shy.
00:05:18.609,00:05:19.986,I should imagine not.
00:05:20.153,00:05:22.572,She'll need all her colors for me.
00:05:33.958,00:05:35.126,Mmm-hmm.
00:05:41.132,00:05:42.133,Mmm!
00:05:43.134,00:05:44.469,Head up.
00:05:49.223,00:05:52.643,I wanted to say I appreciate our being alone today.
00:05:55.813,00:05:57.774,I hope your husband doesn't mind.
00:05:57.940,00:05:59.275,Not at all.
00:06:00.359,00:06:04.447,I could see his being here made you uncomfortable.
00:06:05.698,00:06:07.825,It wasn't personal.
00:06:09.410,00:06:10.703,It's not uncommon.
00:06:11.788,00:06:12.622,-Ah. -Hmm.
00:06:13.706,00:06:16.167,It's hard for a man to be looked at by a woman.
00:06:16.751,00:06:24.092,"Women are used to it, of course, but for a man to, um, submit to a woman's gaze."
00:06:24.467,00:06:26.135,It's unsettling.
00:06:30.181,00:06:38.439,"Although I believe there's some pleasure to be had from it, once you, um, yield."
00:06:41.901,00:06:42.902,Sit.
00:06:43.361,00:06:44.487,Good girl.
00:07:04.507,00:07:05.925,-Morning. -Morning.
00:07:20.982,00:07:21.983,Well?
00:07:24.444,00:07:25.445,Perfect.
00:07:31.242,00:07:32.452,Almost.
00:07:32.577,00:07:33.578,Ah.
00:07:45.548,00:07:46.549,Good luck!
00:08:10.698,00:08:11.824,All portraits.
00:08:17.580,00:08:18.623,Not per se.
00:08:32.261,00:08:35.848,This kind of work is not really my...
00:08:38.017,00:08:41.896,"Gerda, I don't think it would benefit either of us to show these."
00:08:42.813,00:08:45.900,It's not a judgment on your abilities.
00:08:45.983,00:08:48.152,I agree with Einar.
00:08:48.277,00:08:52.490,You could be a first-class painter if you found the right subject matter.
00:09:05.211,00:09:06.212,How was it?
00:09:06.754,00:09:07.755,Fine.
00:09:09.507,00:09:11.467,I finally managed to get the color for the snow.
00:09:13.010,00:09:14.387,A bog in Vejle.
00:09:15.763,00:09:18.307,I don't know how you can paint the same thing over and over.
00:09:18.724,00:09:20.851,I suppose I just haven't finished with it yet.
00:09:21.227,00:09:22.061,Gerda?
00:09:22.144,00:09:24.522,Could you please not speak to Rasmussen about me again?
00:09:27.775,00:09:29.569,My work is my business.
00:09:29.986,00:09:31.696,-Stay out of it. -Gerda.
00:10:00.016,00:10:01.434,I have my period.
00:10:02.268,00:10:03.311,Sorry.
00:10:04.812,00:10:07.064,-Are you? -Of course I am.
00:10:07.148,00:10:08.566,"I mean, you know I am."
00:10:15.656,00:10:16.907,Could you help me with something?
00:10:20.703,00:10:21.704,Anything.
00:10:21.787,00:10:24.081,Ulla has an extra rehearsal. She canceled again.
00:10:24.165,00:10:25.291,Oh.
00:10:26.375,00:10:28.336,Would you try on her stockings and shoes?
00:10:28.836,00:10:31.839,"I'm just so behind, I don't know how I'll be finished in time for her opening."
00:10:31.922,00:10:33.257,"Yeah, I'll..."
00:10:33.466,00:10:34.634,I'll do it.
00:10:35.092,00:10:36.636,"It's fine, I'll do it."
00:10:38.220,00:10:39.221,They're there.
00:11:15.716,00:11:16.884,He almost snagged it.
00:11:22.932,00:11:24.141,Uh...
00:11:24.225,00:11:25.768,That's backwards.
00:11:35.152,00:11:37.405,I saw those in the window at Fonnesbech's.
00:11:39.240,00:11:40.866,"Smart, aren't they?"
00:11:41.117,00:11:42.451,I don't think they'll fit.
00:11:43.494,00:11:44.703,"Well, you do the best you can."
00:12:05.891,00:12:08.185,"-No, I need the dress. -No."
00:12:08.269,00:12:09.812,I need to see how the hem falls.
00:12:09.937,00:12:10.980,"No, Gerda, I'm not putting it on."
00:12:11.105,00:12:13.107,"Well, I haven't asked you to."
00:12:18.779,00:12:20.281,Just relax.
00:12:21.782,00:12:23.284,The sooner I start...
00:12:24.743,00:12:26.704,the sooner I finish.
00:13:15.252,00:13:17.087,"Well, hello, there!"
00:13:21.133,00:13:23.552,"Oh, don't worry, my darling."
00:13:28.557,00:13:30.559,We're going to call you...
00:13:33.771,00:13:34.772,Lili.
00:13:56.377,00:13:58.128,Such concentration.
00:14:00.673,00:14:04.718,Sometimes I think you're going to slip through the surface of the painting and vanish.
00:14:04.802,00:14:06.262,Into the bog.
00:14:08.514,00:14:10.849,Like your friend's kite when you were a boy.
00:14:12.017,00:14:13.435,-Hans. -Mmm.
00:14:13.519,00:14:14.979,"Yes, Hans."
00:14:18.774,00:14:23.153,"I bet he still sits on that rock, sobbing his heart out."
00:14:23.237,00:14:24.321,Don't.
00:14:26.240,00:14:28.576,He's actually an art dealer in Paris.
00:14:29.410,00:14:32.329,-Peddling old masters to rich Americans. -Hmm.
00:14:32.580,00:14:34.164,So we don't need to worry about Hans.
00:14:34.248,00:14:36.375,"No, we don't need to worry about Hans."
00:14:39.128,00:14:40.170,I didn't mean to disturb you.
00:14:40.254,00:14:42.131,"No, it's okay. I'm finished."
00:14:42.673,00:14:45.885,"And don't worry, I won't disappear into the bog."
00:15:09.325,00:15:12.119,-What? -Can't a man watch his wife get undressed?
00:15:18.334,00:15:19.627,It's new.
00:15:20.210,00:15:22.212,That's very observant.
00:15:25.883,00:15:27.301,"Oh, no, leave it on."
00:15:42.524,00:15:43.734,It's pretty.
00:15:46.153,00:15:47.279,I might let you borrow it.
00:15:49.990,00:15:51.492,I might enjoy that.
00:15:52.326,00:15:53.994,Is there something you'd like to tell me?
00:15:54.078,00:15:55.454,Is there something you'd like to know?
00:15:55.537,00:15:56.747,No.
00:15:57.539,00:15:58.874,I'm your wife.
00:16:00.501,00:16:01.752,I know everything.
00:16:11.553,00:16:13.847,"Those two, over there."
00:16:16.141,00:16:17.393,And at the same time.
00:16:18.560,00:16:22.064,"Oh, married people are so delightfully easy to shock."
00:16:22.147,00:16:24.692,We just pretend to be shocked because it encourages you.
00:16:25.150,00:16:26.610,I know.
00:16:26.694,00:16:29.738,That is why you're the only married couple in my party for the Artists' Ball.
00:16:31.532,00:16:32.700,She can go without me.
00:16:32.783,00:16:36.620,"Gerda without an escort? Why, it would be a scandal!"
00:16:36.996,00:16:38.372,Gerda loves a scandal.
00:16:38.497,00:16:39.707,Look at the way she dresses.
00:16:40.082,00:16:41.250,Flaunting her ankles.
00:16:41.333,00:16:44.962,I don't think anyone is likely to be corrupted by seeing my ankles.
00:16:45.087,00:16:45.921,I was.
00:16:47.089,00:16:52.219,"It was the first time we met, I was leaving the Academy and she was sitting on the steps, flaunting said ankles."
00:16:54.263,00:16:56.348,And she propositioned me.
00:16:56.890,00:16:58.058,Is that true?
00:16:58.183,00:17:00.644,"When I said hello to him, he actually blushed."
00:17:02.813,00:17:05.524,"He was so shy, so I asked him out."
00:17:05.691,00:17:06.942,And you said yes.
00:17:07.151,00:17:08.402,"Well, she made me."
00:17:09.862,00:17:11.030,She seemed so sure.
00:17:11.196,00:17:12.489,I was sure.
00:17:14.033,00:17:15.034,I still am.
00:17:18.078,00:17:19.496,What was it about him?
00:17:19.580,00:17:21.123,I don't know.
00:17:22.583,00:17:28.130,"But we went for coffee, and after, I kissed him."
00:17:30.299,00:17:33.802,And it was the strangest thing. It was like kissing myself.
00:17:35.429,00:17:37.264,These two won't be staying much longer.
00:17:38.223,00:17:41.018,Unmarried people are so delightfully easy to shock.
00:17:59.536,00:18:00.662,Leave it.
00:18:05.000,00:18:07.961,Were you really corrupted by my ankles?
00:18:12.257,00:18:14.218,You were shameless.
00:18:16.470,00:18:17.805,I still am.
00:19:34.882,00:19:38.594,"Beautiful, shameless Gerda."
00:19:57.404,00:19:58.530,Wait.
00:20:38.487,00:20:39.571,Sorry.
00:20:39.738,00:20:41.240,I couldn't sleep.
00:20:42.032,00:20:43.242,Why?
00:20:45.619,00:20:47.120,Wondering about things.
00:20:47.913,00:20:49.581,What things?
00:20:50.290,00:20:53.168,Wondering if we made a baby last night.
00:20:57.547,00:20:59.925,Wondering when you got so pretty.
00:21:00.634,00:21:03.178,I was always pretty.
00:21:03.262,00:21:06.139,But you just never noticed.
00:21:52.561,00:21:54.438,"These are good, Gerda."
00:21:57.274,00:21:58.442,-You think? -Mmm.
00:22:00.944,00:22:02.195,"Well, thank you."
00:22:02.529,00:22:04.072,I had a coffee with Ulla.
00:22:07.034,00:22:08.243,I'm not going.
00:22:08.327,00:22:10.120,Don't worry.
00:22:10.954,00:22:12.372,I told her no.
00:22:14.541,00:22:17.127,You should go. You enjoy it.
00:22:17.210,00:22:18.962,"With you, I enjoy it."
00:22:19.129,00:22:20.464,It's good to be seen at those things.
00:22:21.798,00:22:23.008,And that's why you hate them.
00:22:23.091,00:22:25.427,I feel as though I'm performing myself.
00:22:26.219,00:22:28.930,Giving them your Einar Wegener.
00:22:29.014,00:22:30.015,Mmm-hmm.
00:22:34.728,00:22:37.022,Why not give them something different?
00:22:37.814,00:22:39.191,Go as someone else?
00:22:41.443,00:22:43.695,Do you have someone in particular in mind?
00:22:49.367,00:22:50.452,No.
00:22:50.535,00:22:52.496,You'd be very convincing.
00:22:57.334,00:22:58.627,That is outrageous.
00:22:58.710,00:23:00.504,"Oh, you might even enjoy it."
00:23:00.587,00:23:01.588,No.
00:23:10.430,00:23:13.308,You'll have to shave closer next time.
00:23:22.818,00:23:25.403,Mmm? Mmm.
00:23:27.781,00:23:28.990,Close your eyes.
00:23:29.407,00:23:31.034,This is hard on someone else.
00:23:31.118,00:23:32.119,"Well, let me try."
00:23:42.504,00:23:43.797,What do you think?
00:23:45.006,00:23:46.466,Better than I ever manage.
00:23:48.802,00:23:49.970,Lili.
00:23:50.262,00:23:52.013,I want to sketch you.
00:23:55.684,00:23:58.353,"Come on, Hvap. Come on, you."
00:23:58.436,00:23:59.604,Lean to the side.
00:24:00.147,00:24:01.148,Knee over.
00:24:05.110,00:24:07.529,Look at those hands. Relax.
00:24:24.379,00:24:25.589,Don't make her a slut!
00:24:25.672,00:24:27.007,It's your fault.
00:24:28.425,00:24:30.135,You excite her.
00:24:32.679,00:24:34.139,You are forward.
00:24:34.222,00:24:36.391,You have no idea.
00:24:55.327,00:24:56.369,Morning.
00:25:04.377,00:25:05.212,"Morning, Thorbjorn."
00:25:05.629,00:25:06.755,Good morning.
00:26:08.692,00:26:10.026,I was wondering where you were.
00:26:11.861,00:26:13.280,It's getting late.
00:26:14.531,00:26:15.824,We have plenty of time.
00:26:16.908,00:26:18.076,I bought you these.
00:26:23.248,00:26:24.499,"Oh, they're perfect."
00:26:28.003,00:26:29.546,Are you sure about tonight?
00:26:46.813,00:26:47.981,What is it?
00:26:49.983,00:26:51.318,Am I pretty enough?
00:26:52.569,00:26:54.195,Of course you are.
00:26:57.907,00:27:00.327,I'll never be as pretty as you.
00:27:01.578,00:27:03.580,You are so beautiful.
00:27:18.053,00:27:19.179,My darling!
00:27:20.138,00:27:23.058,"Ulla, let me introduce..."
00:27:25.143,00:27:26.811,It's Lili.
00:27:27.729,00:27:28.730,That's right.
00:27:29.272,00:27:31.316,Einar's cousin from Vejle.
00:27:33.234,00:27:34.944,You're exquisite!
00:27:36.780,00:27:38.239,"In, let's go in."
00:27:38.406,00:27:39.449,Come on.
00:27:41.409,00:27:43.370,"You won't leave me, will you?"
00:27:45.538,00:27:46.956,"No, never."
00:28:01.096,00:28:02.472,People are looking.
00:28:03.807,00:28:05.725,"Well, you're a pretty girl."
00:28:06.726,00:28:08.603,You'll have to get used to it.
00:28:16.111,00:28:17.404,It's fine.
00:28:18.446,00:28:20.198,You're just feeling self-conscious.
00:28:20.365,00:28:21.699,Gerda?
00:28:21.908,00:28:22.909,Oh...
00:28:27.872,00:28:31.000,"No, go, I'll be fine. Please go before they come over."
00:28:31.376,00:28:32.585,All right.
00:28:36.214,00:28:37.424,Who's that?
00:29:30.435,00:29:32.145,Are you a reporter?
00:29:35.064,00:29:36.149,No.
00:29:36.983,00:29:38.401,A poetess?
00:29:57.712,00:29:59.798,Do you know the story of this oak tree?
00:30:02.008,00:30:03.009,No.
00:30:04.636,00:30:08.306,"They say that if you eat its acorns, you can make a wish."
00:30:09.015,00:30:11.476,And become anyone you want for a day.
00:30:15.188,00:30:16.856,Why would they say that?
00:30:20.401,00:30:22.320,Henrik Sandahl.
00:30:22.403,00:30:23.988,At your disposal.
00:30:24.531,00:30:25.657,Lili.
00:30:28.368,00:30:30.036,"Are you here with someone, Lili?"
00:30:31.412,00:30:33.164,"Yes, my, uh..."
00:30:33.248,00:30:34.666,My cousin's wife.
00:30:36.918,00:30:37.961,Who's your cousin?
00:30:39.629,00:30:41.840,Einar Wegener. Painter.
00:30:42.924,00:30:45.760,"Yes, he's rather a good one."
00:30:46.803,00:30:48.513,He's better than most people think.
00:30:50.056,00:30:51.057,Is that right?
00:30:51.140,00:30:53.184,"Most people our age, at any rate."
00:30:59.440,00:31:03.236,"Don't go back in there. It's, um... It's cooler out here."
00:31:05.238,00:31:06.865,"Besides, I'm a romantic."
00:31:07.282,00:31:08.324,Really?
00:31:09.367,00:31:10.535,I prefer the shadows.
00:31:11.286,00:31:16.249,"And I don't mean to presume, but I've been watching you."
00:31:18.585,00:31:20.044,And I think you might be the same.
00:31:27.760,00:31:28.887,Come on.
00:31:38.813,00:31:40.899,Have you seen Einar? I can't find him.
00:31:41.065,00:31:43.484,Of course you can't. He isn't here.
00:31:46.988,00:31:48.114,Cheers.
00:31:51.701,00:31:53.244,You're different from most girls.
00:31:57.749,00:31:59.208,That's not a very original line.
00:31:59.459,00:32:00.543,It's true.
00:32:03.338,00:32:05.173,You're old-fashioned.
00:32:05.298,00:32:06.591,Provincial.
00:32:09.052,00:32:10.553,I'm new to the city.
00:32:10.887,00:32:12.513,"No, it's more than that."
00:32:14.891,00:32:18.686,I feel I'd need to ask your permission before I kissed you.
00:32:25.109,00:32:27.028,I should go and find Gerda.
00:32:30.448,00:32:32.325,Why don't you tell her I'll walk you home?
00:32:34.577,00:32:36.204,"No, she wouldn't like that."
00:32:40.792,00:32:43.670,"He might be waiting for us, and he wouldn't like this."
00:32:44.587,00:32:45.880,Wouldn't he?
00:32:47.465,00:32:48.549,No.
00:32:52.345,00:32:53.554,Lili...
00:32:56.057,00:32:57.100,Lili...
00:33:02.355,00:33:03.606,Lili...
00:33:25.128,00:33:27.463,You didn't ask permission.
00:33:27.547,00:33:29.966,I couldn't risk you saying no.
00:33:36.597,00:33:38.182,What's the matter?
00:33:50.111,00:33:51.904,"I'm sorry, I don't know what happened."
00:34:22.852,00:34:24.353,How are you?
00:34:30.526,00:34:32.528,"You were late home last night, so I thought I'd let you sleep."
00:34:35.198,00:34:36.491,How was it?
00:34:37.867,00:34:39.577,Did Lili have fun?
00:34:57.845,00:35:00.473,I think it would be better if Lili didn't come here again.
00:35:04.852,00:35:05.853,Fine.
00:35:06.646,00:35:09.232,Exactly what happened between you and Sandahl last night?
00:35:09.315,00:35:11.984,Nothing. It was nothing.
00:35:12.193,00:35:13.986,Did he know it was you?
00:35:14.362,00:35:15.696,It wasn't as simple as that.
00:35:15.780,00:35:19.826,"I watched him kiss you, Einar, so could you please make an effort?"
00:35:22.745,00:35:26.415,"He may have known who I was, but I wasn't always me."
00:35:27.291,00:35:32.046,"There was a moment when I was just Lili, and I think that he could see that."
00:35:33.798,00:35:36.300,-Do you see? -But Lili doesn't exist.
00:35:39.929,00:35:42.014,-We made her up. -I know.
00:35:42.223,00:35:44.600,-We were playing a game. -I know we were.
00:35:46.561,00:35:47.854,But then...
00:35:50.898,00:35:52.108,Something changed.
00:35:52.191,00:35:55.027,This is absurd. We... We need to stop.
00:35:55.987,00:35:57.738,"You need to stop, Einar."
00:35:59.699,00:36:01.200,I am going to try.
00:36:30.313,00:36:31.564,It's nothing.
00:36:36.110,00:36:37.153,Can I get you anything?
00:36:39.113,00:36:40.114,I'm fine.
00:36:50.875,00:36:52.585,Maybe you should see a doctor.
00:36:52.919,00:36:53.920,Gerda...
00:36:55.046,00:36:56.047,I'm fine.
00:40:11.742,00:40:12.910,I didn't think you'd come.
00:40:15.746,00:40:16.747,No.
00:40:18.165,00:40:19.417,Nor did I.
00:40:35.558,00:40:37.226,I thought you might not come back.
00:40:39.520,00:40:40.646,That's absurd.
00:40:41.730,00:40:42.898,Is it?
00:40:50.030,00:40:51.031,Come here.
00:41:18.434,00:41:19.768,The model...
00:41:23.147,00:41:24.482,Einar's cousin.
00:41:30.696,00:41:32.740,The resemblance is...
00:41:39.288,00:41:40.122,Are there others?
00:41:40.581,00:41:42.374,A series back at the studio.
00:41:45.794,00:41:47.296,These are different.
00:41:48.547,00:41:49.882,For these...
00:41:50.341,00:41:52.051,"I don't know, there may be a market."
00:41:52.718,00:41:54.094,You're taking them?
00:41:54.178,00:41:55.513,"Well, yes."
00:42:10.986,00:42:12.029,Come in.
00:42:18.536,00:42:19.912,I haven't got long.
00:42:20.621,00:42:22.331,Gerda's seeing Rasmussen.
00:42:25.000,00:42:26.710,I don't like all these lies.
00:42:29.338,00:42:30.506,She's very protective.
00:42:30.839,00:42:32.591,Why don't you just tell her about us?
00:42:32.758,00:42:34.093,I couldn't do that.
00:42:43.602,00:42:44.603,Sorry.
00:42:45.896,00:42:47.439,I don't want to upset you.
00:42:52.736,00:42:53.737,Come here.
00:43:02.246,00:43:04.206,-No. -Yes.
00:43:11.088,00:43:12.089,Einar.
00:43:15.301,00:43:16.302,What?
00:43:16.468,00:43:19.013,Come on. Shh. It's all right.
00:43:21.515,00:43:23.309,"I'm sorry, I don't understand."
00:43:26.228,00:43:28.564,I... Lili.
00:43:28.647,00:43:29.648,Please.
00:43:31.233,00:43:32.860,I don't know what you want.
00:43:34.486,00:43:36.488,-I want you. -I don't know what you mean.
00:43:37.990,00:43:40.326,-I want you. -No!
00:43:40.618,00:43:42.911,"Lili. Lili. Lili, wait!"
00:44:46.100,00:44:47.726,Are you all right?
00:45:00.906,00:45:03.409,I've been seeing Henrik Sandahl.
00:45:17.548,00:45:18.590,I'm...
00:45:45.742,00:45:47.578,I thought perhaps you knew.
00:45:49.705,00:45:50.998,Not this.
00:45:53.292,00:45:54.334,So...
00:45:57.087,00:45:58.547,Are you in love with Sandahl?
00:45:59.506,00:46:00.674,No.
00:46:02.301,00:46:04.761,"No, I love you."
00:46:05.262,00:46:08.140,"Gerda, only you. It's Lili, she..."
00:46:09.516,00:46:10.559,Be honest.
00:46:10.684,00:46:14.313,"I need you to believe me, Gerda. You of all people to understand."
00:46:14.480,00:46:21.695,"All right. You need to tell me when Henrik and Lili are together, they what? They..."
00:46:22.738,00:46:23.739,They kiss?
00:46:26.950,00:46:29.036,-Has it gone beyond that? -No.
00:46:30.954,00:46:33.040,"No, Lili has never gone further than that with a man."
00:46:33.123,00:46:34.291,She wouldn't. She's...
00:46:34.374,00:46:35.876,There have been other men?
00:46:37.586,00:46:41.298,"There was another, yes, but it was a long time ago."
00:46:45.928,00:46:47.012,In Vejle.
00:46:47.971,00:46:50.349,"She fell for him, and..."
00:46:51.808,00:46:53.519,he kissed her. Just once.
00:46:56.355,00:46:59.358,But then my father came in and he caught them.
00:47:00.734,00:47:02.861,And he smacked Hans down.
00:47:03.820,00:47:05.322,He was so angry.
00:47:07.199,00:47:08.700,I don't know what to say.
00:47:14.456,00:47:15.457,What?
00:47:19.878,00:47:21.004,I'm so sorry.
00:47:22.381,00:47:24.299,"-I'm so sorry, I'm not feeling well. -Einar, what is it?"
00:47:24.508,00:47:26.093,"Einar, Einar, Einar!"
00:47:26.218,00:47:29.137,Einar. What's happened? What's happening?
00:47:29.221,00:47:31.848,-I'm all right. I'm all right. -What? Do you have pain?
00:47:50.784,00:48:04.423,"So, you saw Dr. Andersen after a bout of severe nosebleeds, which you have come to believe coincide with the stomach cramps, and on a monthly basis."
00:48:05.215,00:48:06.258,Hmm.
00:48:07.509,00:48:08.510,So.
00:48:08.760,00:48:09.970,How long have you been married?
00:48:10.846,00:48:11.888,Six years.
00:48:11.972,00:48:13.140,Children?
00:48:13.223,00:48:14.224,No.
00:48:15.267,00:48:16.602,Is there regular copulation?
00:48:19.021,00:48:20.355,Yes.
00:48:22.524,00:48:26.111,Perhaps less now than before-- Than before you started to dress as a woman?
00:48:27.529,00:48:30.407,"I'm a specialist, Mr. Wegener. You may be embarrassed."
00:48:30.490,00:48:31.992,I am not.
00:48:32.284,00:48:35.037,Tell me about Lili.
00:48:36.121,00:48:37.164,Where does she come from?
00:48:38.040,00:48:39.082,Inside me.
00:48:42.919,00:48:48.467,"You know, the most likely explanation for all of this is a chemical imbalance."
00:48:49.426,00:48:50.594,-Really? -Mmm.
00:48:51.470,00:48:52.512,Onto the bed.
00:48:53.597,00:48:59.770,"That would explain the pain, the confused state of masculinity and the infertility."
00:48:59.978,00:49:02.272,"Let's hope it is that, because that, at least, we can cure."
00:49:07.027,00:49:08.528,I don't need to do this.
00:49:08.987,00:49:10.072,There's nothing wrong with me.
00:49:10.155,00:49:12.157,"-That's not true. -Gerda, this can't be right."
00:49:12.407,00:49:14.743,"Radiation is a miracle, Mr. Wegener."
00:49:15.202,00:49:17.996,It destroys the bad and saves the good.
00:49:18.705,00:49:20.749,I'm sure it'll be over quickly.
00:50:03.875,00:50:04.918,Mr. Wegener?
00:50:06.086,00:50:07.671,How are you feeling this morning?
00:50:10.340,00:50:12.551,You hurt Lili.
00:50:15.679,00:50:18.932,I'm afraid your husband's aberrant thinking persists.
00:50:21.435,00:50:23.562,Do you keep a lock on your wardrobe?
00:50:23.729,00:50:24.730,Of course not.
00:50:24.813,00:50:27.482,"Mrs. Wegener, you're not encouraging this delusion?"
00:50:29.067,00:50:31.027,You do understand that your husband is insane?
00:50:31.194,00:50:33.488,No. That's not true.
00:50:34.740,00:50:37.075,We trusted you. We came to you for help.
00:51:02.601,00:51:04.519,Gerda!
00:51:04.936,00:51:06.646,Where have you been?
00:51:06.897,00:51:07.731,Away.
00:51:08.774,00:51:10.817,Why? What's wrong?
00:51:10.901,00:51:13.236,I sold the Lili portraits.
00:51:13.320,00:51:16.907,"I have enough interest, now, to mount a full show."
00:51:23.413,00:51:28.543,The Gallery Etienne Dufour in Paris wants to represent you.
00:51:30.170,00:51:32.464,"-In Paris? -Yes, you must go."
00:51:35.842,00:51:37.302,I can't travel just now.
00:51:38.303,00:51:41.097,"Gerda, this is your moment."
00:51:41.181,00:51:42.599,You've waited long enough.
00:51:43.141,00:51:44.476,These art dealers can be fickle.
00:51:50.398,00:51:51.399,Oh!
00:52:16.550,00:52:17.801,What are you doing?
00:52:18.426,00:52:20.053,I've been asked to exhibit in Paris.
00:52:20.345,00:52:23.139,-That's wonderful. -Yes.
00:52:23.223,00:52:24.516,We have to go.
00:52:25.183,00:52:26.935,Rasmussen said it would make all the difference.
00:52:27.018,00:52:29.396,"Gerda, I'm not sure that I can."
00:52:30.230,00:52:31.231,I'll take care of you.
00:52:31.356,00:52:34.651,"-Yes, but surely there's no rush. -Can't you just do this one thing for me?"
00:52:37.362,00:52:38.363,What's happening?
00:52:41.032,00:52:42.784,I had a letter from Hexler.
00:52:43.493,00:52:44.870,He wants to lock me up.
00:52:47.664,00:52:50.041,Everything will work out for us.
00:52:51.501,00:52:53.503,Really. I know it.
00:52:56.548,00:52:58.508,You just have to trust me.
00:53:00.969,00:53:01.970,I do.
00:53:27.746,00:53:30.832,Oh. Do you exhibit in Paris?
00:53:31.082,00:53:34.961,I think my work's a little introspective for French taste.
00:53:35.045,00:53:38.048,Excuse me. Is the model here?
00:53:38.590,00:53:39.633,No.
00:53:40.634,00:53:41.593,She stayed behind in Denmark.
00:53:41.676,00:53:44.721,"Oh, I was so hoping to meet her."
00:53:47.390,00:53:49.476,"Madame Gerda Wegener, Madame de la Roche..."
00:54:13.291,00:54:14.960,I'm sorry.
00:54:33.269,00:54:34.437,Will you sit for me?
00:54:37.023,00:54:38.024,Just as you are.
00:54:39.901,00:54:41.903,We haven't done that since art school.
00:54:43.738,00:54:48.159,"The teacher, suddenly at the mercy of the student."
00:54:48.451,00:54:50.036,You found it exciting.
00:54:52.038,00:54:53.665,I can't just now.
00:54:55.333,00:54:56.334,I'm sorry.
00:54:58.211,00:54:59.671,I miss you.
00:55:01.506,00:55:03.800,I miss you working beside me.
00:55:05.677,00:55:07.595,I can't remember the landscape anymore.
00:55:10.348,00:55:12.392,I can't remember Vejle.
00:55:15.854,00:55:18.148,"Well, you can help me with this background."
00:55:19.691,00:55:22.861,What does it need? A kettle-hole lake?
00:55:24.029,00:55:26.114,A farmhouse? Far off?
00:55:26.489,00:55:27.490,Gerda.
00:56:09.407,00:56:10.575,Merci.
00:58:10.695,00:58:13.531,"Look, I have to go, I have some Danish girl waiting to see me."
00:58:14.157,00:58:15.200,All right.
00:58:25.084,00:58:26.336,Hans Axgil.
00:58:27.462,00:58:29.756,Hello. Thank you for seeing me.
00:58:29.839,00:58:33.635,"Don't thank me yet, I can't represent you. I don't handle any contemporary art."
00:58:33.718,00:58:35.970,Of course. I know that.
00:58:36.054,00:58:38.890,"The reviews for your show were terrific, but..."
00:58:38.973,00:58:42.727,"Perhaps if you would let me speak, things would be clearer."
00:58:50.735,00:58:52.195,but I'm happy he did.
00:58:55.156,00:58:58.159,I wanted to meet you to put a face to a name.
00:58:58.785,00:58:59.786,Hmm.
00:59:00.245,00:59:02.747,I believe you were a childhood friend of my husband.
00:59:04.749,00:59:06.167,You have a husband?
00:59:10.672,00:59:12.465,I'm married to Einar Wegener.
00:59:12.882,00:59:13.883,Einar?
00:59:14.008,00:59:15.134,You remember him?
00:59:15.218,00:59:18.721,Of course I remember him. We were such friends. How is he?
00:59:19.764,00:59:21.349,He told me that you kissed him once.
00:59:21.432,00:59:22.850,I what?
00:59:30.275,00:59:34.028,"We were fooling in the kitchen, and he was wearing his grandmother's apron."
00:59:34.112,00:59:37.240,"You know, little boys, playing around."
00:59:37.323,00:59:40.034,He just looked so pretty in it. I had to kiss him!
00:59:40.118,00:59:42.704,"So, yes, I kissed Einar."
00:59:43.913,00:59:45.832,"The next thing I know, his father's chasing me out."
00:59:49.586,00:59:50.753,"Einar, my God."
00:59:51.462,00:59:53.131,Why didn't he come today?
00:59:55.592,00:59:57.885,I don't think he'd like me asking for help.
01:00:00.346,01:00:03.766,We don't really know people here. And Einar is... He's...
01:00:04.642,01:00:06.185,He's lost his way.
01:00:06.436,01:00:08.062,He's not working.
01:00:08.146,01:00:11.941,"He needs someone to represent him, someone who knows him."
01:00:14.902,01:00:15.987,He needs a friend.
01:00:32.503,01:00:33.963,I'd like you to meet him.
01:00:35.757,01:00:37.717,I don't want a new dealer.
01:00:38.092,01:00:40.219,It doesn't make sense to me. I'm hardly working.
01:00:41.054,01:00:42.680,That might change.
01:00:43.556,01:00:44.891,I don't think so.
01:00:45.350,01:00:46.809,I'm happy helping you.
01:00:48.478,01:00:49.854,It's Hans Axgil.
01:00:51.648,01:00:55.068,"Dinner at La Dauphine at 8:00, then back here to see the paintings."
01:00:56.235,01:00:58.404,He remembers you with great fondness.
01:01:11.501,01:01:13.419,"It was handmade, and I've had it since I was four."
01:01:13.503,01:01:17.048,"You know, Einar's still stricken with guilt about crashing your kite."
01:01:17.131,01:01:19.550,My kite? I'll tease him about that.
01:01:19.717,01:01:22.553,"No, it's too cruel."
01:01:22.637,01:01:25.682,"Well, if he ever gets here. Perhaps he doesn't want to see me."
01:01:25.765,01:01:29.185,"No. No, it's not that."
01:01:31.729,01:01:33.356,Maybe we should order without him.
01:01:34.607,01:01:36.150,Does he abandon you often?
01:01:37.485,01:01:38.903,Of course not.
01:01:40.113,01:01:41.114,I was joking.
01:01:48.329,01:01:51.290,"I can come back another time, if you think Einar would prefer it."
01:01:52.792,01:01:53.835,Really.
01:01:54.127,01:01:55.211,He's expecting you.
01:01:55.962,01:01:57.964,And it'll do him good.
01:02:02.802,01:02:03.803,I know this.
01:02:05.638,01:02:08.057,"The fjord at Vejle, not far from our houses."
01:02:08.516,01:02:10.560,"Yes, he painted it just before we left."
01:02:13.521,01:02:14.522,Lili.
01:02:16.816,01:02:17.817,Hans.
01:02:19.068,01:02:22.655,May I introduce Lili Wegener.
01:02:23.573,01:02:25.074,Einar's cousin from home.
01:02:28.786,01:02:30.747,You cannot imagine how happy I am.
01:02:33.583,01:02:38.963,"We actually met once before, in Vejle, but you probably don't remember."
01:02:43.009,01:02:44.552,May I take your coat?
01:02:45.511,01:02:46.512,Of course.
01:02:48.306,01:02:49.891,"A digestif, Hans?"
01:02:54.520,01:02:56.481,It's so chilly all of a sudden.
01:02:57.440,01:02:59.776,I feel the cold these days. I don't know why.
01:03:00.276,01:03:01.319,Here.
01:03:07.784,01:03:09.952,I'm so sorry that Einar couldn't be here.
01:03:10.828,01:03:15.166,"He told me how, back in Vejle, you were his great friend."
01:03:16.334,01:03:18.878,-Both always plotting to get away. -That's true.
01:03:23.382,01:03:30.056,"He said that you would sit and you'd look out together, beyond the fjord, to the sea."
01:03:31.349,01:03:32.350,To the future.
01:03:33.309,01:03:35.311,"We had big dreams, yes."
01:03:35.978,01:03:37.146,Yes.
01:03:39.023,01:03:42.235,And that you were the only one that would let him paint in peace.
01:03:43.110,01:03:45.363,Who told him it was all right to be a painter.
01:03:45.530,01:03:47.156,He used to sketch my portrait.
01:03:48.032,01:03:51.035,Take a stone and draw me on the rocks at the side of the road.
01:03:54.205,01:03:55.498,I didn't know that.
01:03:55.665,01:03:57.041,Yes.
01:04:00.044,01:04:01.671,Would you like to see more of Einar's work?
01:04:01.754,01:04:03.422,-Yes. -But do we have any?
01:04:03.798,01:04:04.924,"Of course, Lili."
01:04:05.007,01:04:06.968,Could we not do it another time? Because I just...
01:04:07.051,01:04:08.803,"I want to hear more about you, Hans."
01:04:09.011,01:04:10.012,Are you married?
01:04:10.096,01:04:11.889,"-Uh, no. -Well, why not?"
01:04:15.309,01:04:16.727,"You don't mind, do you?"
01:04:16.811,01:04:19.981,I've been on my own a long time now. I'm too set in my ways.
01:04:23.025,01:04:26.195,I think that marriage is the single thing we should all hope for in life.
01:04:27.488,01:04:28.531,Really?
01:04:29.156,01:04:31.242,It creates someone else.
01:04:32.994,01:04:35.162,More than just the two of you.
01:04:37.623,01:04:39.750,"Yes, I think it'd be terrible not to..."
01:04:42.753,01:04:45.756,I think it'd be terrible... I'm so... Will you excuse me?
01:04:46.757,01:04:47.758,Lili.
01:05:02.231,01:05:03.274,You ought to go.
01:05:04.150,01:05:05.234,Let me help.
01:05:08.279,01:05:09.322,Please.
01:05:15.620,01:05:16.662,I'm sorry.
01:05:21.208,01:05:22.251,"Good night, Lili."
01:05:34.680,01:05:36.891,"I don't think he noticed, do you?"
01:05:38.476,01:05:39.810,I don't know.
01:05:41.646,01:05:43.356,I think I got out just in time.
01:05:46.275,01:05:47.318,Sleep now.
01:05:48.444,01:05:49.946,We'll talk more tomorrow.
01:05:52.073,01:05:54.283,Can I borrow a nightdress?
01:06:00.706,01:06:02.083,"No, we've never done that."
01:06:04.377,01:06:06.170,Lili's never spent the night.
01:06:08.172,01:06:10.174,It doesn't matter what I wear.
01:06:14.553,01:06:15.805,'Cause when I dream...
01:06:17.974,01:06:19.684,They're Lili's dreams.
01:06:59.932,01:07:01.100,A new dress.
01:07:01.183,01:07:02.601,And this is for you.
01:07:04.228,01:07:05.604,Do you like it?
01:07:06.188,01:07:07.231,Yes.
01:07:11.360,01:07:13.195,It's perfect for you.
01:07:13.279,01:07:14.989,We're a little short of money at the moment.
01:07:15.072,01:07:16.198,I know.
01:07:16.449,01:07:18.951,"But now that I'm back, I can sit for you again."
01:07:20.244,01:07:23.581,"Well, it worked well before. Didn't it work?"
01:07:26.417,01:07:29.086,"Come on. Come on, Hvap."
01:07:37.136,01:07:38.179,Head up.
01:07:38.262,01:07:39.597,Up. There.
01:07:39.847,01:07:41.182,"-No, back. -Yes. Okay."
01:07:49.940,01:07:51.901,"-Is that good? -Ring, up."
01:07:57.823,01:07:59.241,Thank you.
01:08:22.306,01:08:24.016,I didn't know you were coming.
01:08:24.767,01:08:25.935,It's a good crowd.
01:08:26.143,01:08:27.686,She's a popular girl.
01:08:29.396,01:08:31.023,Thank you for coming.
01:08:32.399,01:08:35.486,Thank you for inviting me. I thought you'd forgotten all about me.
01:08:35.736,01:08:37.071,We've been busy.
01:08:38.781,01:08:40.032,Is Einar here?
01:08:42.034,01:08:43.202,He hates this kind of thing.
01:08:44.995,01:08:46.455,"For you, I mean."
01:08:47.540,01:08:48.624,I don't mind.
01:08:48.707,01:08:49.834,Is he well?
01:08:50.751,01:08:52.253,He's excited.
01:08:52.753,01:08:56.423,"Our friend, uh, is coming to town, Ulla Fonsmarck, the dancer. You, maybe, know her?"
01:08:56.507,01:08:58.592,"No, I don't think so."
01:09:01.345,01:09:02.930,Can I take you to dinner?
01:09:04.098,01:09:05.391,To celebrate?
01:09:05.474,01:09:07.184,I think someone ought to.
01:09:08.394,01:09:10.437,No. Thank you.
01:09:10.771,01:09:11.772,Gerda.
01:09:13.816,01:09:15.234,Have I offended you?
01:09:17.653,01:09:18.654,No.
01:09:22.449,01:09:24.285,I'm still Einar's wife.
01:09:33.210,01:09:34.336,"Oh, Henri!"
01:09:51.478,01:09:53.272,At least take an umbrella.
01:09:53.355,01:09:56.400,"Oh. No, I'm fine, honestly."
01:09:56.483,01:09:58.986,"Well, if you just wait a minute, someone will drive you."
01:09:59.069,01:10:00.321,"No, I'm fine."
01:10:23.802,01:10:25.930,"My goodness, you're soaked."
01:10:27.806,01:10:29.016,Did it go well?
01:10:30.142,01:10:31.602,"Tell me, how was it?"
01:10:33.062,01:10:35.022,You'd know if you'd been there.
01:10:37.775,01:10:39.193,I've made us a supper.
01:10:39.276,01:10:40.236,You should have come.
01:10:40.319,01:10:42.363,A little sort of celebration.
01:10:43.364,01:10:45.074,This is not how it goes.
01:10:48.202,01:10:49.870,We do these things together.
01:10:51.914,01:10:53.958,That was you and Einar.
01:10:54.041,01:10:56.710,"Stop playing that stupid, stupid game."
01:10:57.044,01:10:58.295,"Please, Gerda."
01:11:00.506,01:11:02.091,Don't you think this is a game.
01:11:03.717,01:11:05.469,You should have been there!
01:11:06.512,01:11:07.513,How could I?
01:11:10.307,01:11:12.935,-Look at me. -Not everything is about you.
01:11:22.945,01:11:24.113,I need to see Einar.
01:11:24.280,01:11:25.990,"Let me help, please."
01:11:26.198,01:11:27.616,I need my husband.
01:11:29.118,01:11:30.119,Go get him.
01:11:33.831,01:11:34.873,I can't.
01:11:35.457,01:11:38.752,I need to talk to my husband. I need to hold my husband.
01:11:41.422,01:11:42.423,I need him.
01:11:43.507,01:11:45.050,Can't you just get him?
01:11:49.888,01:11:51.682,Can you at least try?
01:11:56.687,01:11:57.938,No. I'm sorry.
01:12:31.889,01:12:32.931,Gerda.
01:12:34.224,01:12:35.225,What is it?
01:12:47.154,01:12:48.822,Are you all right?
01:13:08.717,01:13:09.968,"Oh, my God."
01:13:14.681,01:13:15.682,"Gerda, wait."
01:13:16.016,01:13:17.226,Wait!
01:13:49.508,01:13:51.009,I don't think I can...
01:13:51.885,01:13:53.095,Give you what you want.
01:14:08.777,01:14:11.280,I don't know how long we can go on like this.
01:14:16.618,01:14:17.661,No.
01:14:28.338,01:14:30.090,He needs to see someone.
01:14:30.174,01:14:31.717,You know what happened with Hexler.
01:14:32.050,01:14:33.802,But he's so thin.
01:14:35.053,01:14:36.555,Something's wrong with him.
01:14:41.393,01:14:42.561,Look.
01:14:43.270,01:14:47.065,There's a doctor. He runs the Women's Clinic in Dresden.
01:14:47.149,01:14:51.653,He's interested in men like Einar who are...
01:14:52.196,01:14:53.197,Confused.
01:14:55.324,01:14:56.700,Men who are different.
01:14:58.535,01:14:59.953,He's often in Paris.
01:15:00.078,01:15:01.497,Just talk to him.
01:15:11.924,01:15:13.091,How do you feel?
01:15:15.844,01:15:16.887,Come.
01:15:17.471,01:15:18.805,"Listen, I've got somewhere to go."
01:15:19.306,01:15:20.307,Where?
01:15:23.560,01:15:24.770,"Sorry, I..."
01:15:27.648,01:15:29.399,I don't know how to hold on to you any longer.
01:15:33.946,01:15:34.947,I know.
01:15:37.032,01:15:41.787,But I love you and I'm going to find an answer.
01:16:32.713,01:16:34.381,-English? -English.
01:16:34.464,01:16:36.258,Do you speak English?
01:16:36.341,01:16:38.552,"Are you, um, a boy or a girl?"
01:16:38.635,01:16:40.220,-A woman? -Do you have a...
01:16:41.513,01:16:42.556,Or...
01:16:45.434,01:16:47.144,Faut pas avoir peur.
01:16:47.269,01:16:48.270,Joking.
01:16:56.320,01:16:57.571,Debout. Sale pute.
01:17:32.731,01:17:34.816,"I can't hold the buyers much longer, I'm sorry."
01:17:45.702,01:17:47.120,You're good at this.
01:17:48.121,01:17:49.581,I boxed for a while.
01:18:00.884,01:18:02.636,I'm sorry I've not been to see you before.
01:18:03.011,01:18:04.221,That's all right.
01:18:05.389,01:18:06.515,You're here now.
01:18:08.392,01:18:10.602,I couldn't let Gerda see me like this.
01:18:11.770,01:18:13.105,She's had enough to put up with.
01:18:13.772,01:18:14.773,What's happened to you?
01:18:17.943,01:18:19.277,I don't understand.
01:18:21.655,01:18:22.823,Nor do I.
01:18:26.743,01:18:28.829,But I don't think it's anything new.
01:18:30.580,01:18:32.082,Even back in Vejle...
01:18:33.041,01:18:34.584,-What? -Ow. Sorry.
01:18:39.589,01:18:40.632,What?
01:18:42.175,01:18:43.677,...I was different.
01:18:45.721,01:18:48.140,It didn't take much to be different in Vejle.
01:18:48.515,01:18:50.559,Surely that's why we became friends.
01:18:53.812,01:19:00.277,Every morning I promise myself that I will spend the entire day as Einar.
01:19:01.903,01:19:04.239,But there's so little of Einar left.
01:19:04.990,01:19:06.992,You think these things because you're exhausted.
01:19:11.246,01:19:14.291,Sometimes I think about killing Einar.
01:19:15.584,01:19:20.172,But it's only the thought that I'd be killing Lili too that stops me.
01:19:21.715,01:19:23.133,You need to see someone.
01:19:23.967,01:19:25.969,-A doctor. -No.
01:19:26.136,01:19:27.554,-Yes. -No doctors.
01:19:27.637,01:19:29.264,I'll help you find someone.
01:19:30.891,01:19:32.184,You have to try.
01:19:38.398,01:19:44.696,"I drill small holes, here and here."
01:19:44.946,01:19:49.910,"I have listened to you very carefully, and I'm afraid it's not good news."
01:19:50.619,01:19:51.995,You're a homosexual.
01:19:54.331,01:19:57.542,"Well, I don't really know what kind of help I need, but I..."
01:19:58.960,01:20:02.339,I can't go on living without knowing who I am.
01:20:02.422,01:20:04.257,Please excuse me for a moment.
01:20:59.938,01:21:01.273,Do you think I'm insane?
01:21:07.237,01:21:08.613,Did a doctor say that?
01:21:09.155,01:21:11.575,"I'm sorry. I know we agreed no more, but..."
01:21:14.452,01:21:15.537,Look at me.
01:21:15.620,01:21:17.622,You are not insane.
01:21:22.794,01:21:24.045,Did I do this to you?
01:21:25.630,01:21:26.673,What?
01:21:30.844,01:21:33.889,"Sometimes, I... I wonder..."
01:21:34.890,01:21:37.893,"If it hadn't been for the paintings-- No. Gerda, no."
01:21:39.978,01:21:43.899,"You helped bring Lili to life, but she was always there."
01:21:45.692,01:21:46.735,She was always waiting.
01:21:46.818,01:21:48.612,Now she's making you ill.
01:21:50.780,01:21:52.407,I don't know what to do.
01:21:56.494,01:21:58.496,The doctors can't help me.
01:22:04.169,01:22:05.587,Do you want to try one more?
01:22:16.264,01:22:18.558,"...Warnekros, Einar. My husband."
01:22:18.642,01:22:20.268,-Hello. -Good to see you.
01:22:21.770,01:22:25.482,"So, what do you think would explain what you've been experiencing, Mr. Wegener?"
01:22:26.191,01:22:28.193,"Professor Warnekros, the fact is..."
01:22:31.488,01:22:32.948,I believe that I am a woman...
01:22:35.158,01:22:36.368,Inside.
01:22:38.578,01:22:39.621,And I believe it too.
01:22:47.295,01:22:49.297,You probably think that I'm insane.
01:22:51.049,01:22:52.759,Or that we both are.
01:22:53.718,01:22:57.514,"Well, there are people who think that I'm insane."
01:23:02.394,01:23:04.062,But I think you're probably right.
01:23:09.150,01:23:11.903,I've met another man like you.
01:23:13.613,01:23:17.742,"I pursued his case, against the wishes of my colleagues, of course."
01:23:19.411,01:23:20.870,I told him I could operate...
01:23:22.372,01:23:23.748,to make him fully a woman.
01:23:25.792,01:23:27.293,That was what he wanted.
01:23:27.460,01:23:28.753,Is that really possible?
01:23:30.505,01:23:31.923,Was the operation successful?
01:23:32.007,01:23:34.509,"On the morning of the first operation, he ran away."
01:23:35.218,01:23:36.302,He was too frightened.
01:23:36.511,01:23:38.388,I wouldn't do that. I...
01:23:41.641,01:23:43.643,The surgery has never been attempted before.
01:23:43.977,01:23:45.061,Never.
01:23:47.230,01:23:49.941,"Professor Warnekros, what is the surgery?"
01:23:50.775,01:23:51.776,Two operations.
01:23:52.694,01:23:55.071,"The first, to remove the male parts entirely."
01:23:56.698,01:23:58.199,"The second, once you're strong enough again..."
01:23:59.617,01:24:00.869,To construct a vagina.
01:24:09.127,01:24:10.587,An irreversible change...
01:24:13.131,01:24:14.549,And a high risk of failure.
01:24:16.009,01:24:17.010,Infections.
01:24:17.510,01:24:18.511,Complications.
01:24:18.720,01:24:20.055,It's too dangerous.
01:24:20.263,01:24:21.723,It's my only hope.
01:24:25.351,01:24:27.103,I leave for Dresden at lunchtime tomorrow.
01:24:31.357,01:24:32.358,Mrs. Wegener...
01:24:34.319,01:24:36.196,I do believe I can help your husband.
01:24:38.573,01:24:41.201,But he won't be your husband when I've finished.
01:24:57.592,01:24:59.302,I feel strange going dressed like this.
01:24:59.511,01:25:00.762,It's important.
01:25:01.888,01:25:03.765,Hans said the Germans might check your papers.
01:25:04.140,01:25:05.225,You're nearly there.
01:25:06.810,01:25:08.353,I won't be seeing you again.
01:25:11.147,01:25:13.858,I've only really liked a handful of people in my life...
01:25:15.652,01:25:16.778,And you've been two of them.
01:25:21.950,01:25:23.201,Take care.
01:25:27.372,01:25:28.456,Take care.
01:25:33.670,01:25:35.797,I wish you'd let me come with you.
01:25:37.006,01:25:38.007,I can't.
01:25:39.801,01:25:44.097,"You love Einar, and I have to let him go."
01:25:51.020,01:25:52.147,Here.
01:25:53.273,01:25:54.607,Take this.
01:27:51.099,01:27:52.141,Hello.
01:27:52.725,01:27:56.229,"Um, my name is Lili. I'm here to see Professor Warnekros."
01:27:56.479,01:27:57.772,Lili what?
01:28:00.191,01:28:01.234,Elbe.
01:28:02.068,01:28:03.736,"Lili Elbe, like the river."
01:28:04.654,01:28:07.949,Of course. Please take a seat over there.
01:28:35.852,01:28:37.228,Must I really wait?
01:28:38.479,01:28:39.772,It's only a week.
01:28:40.982,01:28:43.609,I need you to rest. Gain some weight.
01:28:43.693,01:28:45.320,We can't risk an infection.
01:28:49.532,01:28:55.121,For what we are attempting I'll need you to be strong.
01:28:57.373,01:28:59.000,"This is not my body, Professor."
01:29:01.336,01:29:03.087,Please take it away.
01:29:10.762,01:29:12.388,You're having a baby.
01:29:15.433,01:29:16.434,And you?
01:29:16.559,01:29:18.561,"Oh, no, no. I'm..."
01:29:19.729,01:29:21.481,I'm ill inside.
01:29:21.564,01:29:23.566,But Professor Warnekros is going to make me better.
01:29:23.649,01:29:26.277,And will you be able to have children after?
01:29:28.071,01:29:29.697,"Do you know, I don't know."
01:29:33.076,01:29:34.369,I hope so.
01:29:39.791,01:29:41.084,"Gerda, why don't you go?"
01:29:44.253,01:29:46.506,-He asked me not to. -He wanted to protect you.
01:29:46.589,01:29:48.382,You should be there. I'll go with you.
01:29:48.591,01:29:50.635,"If I go, it will be alone."
01:29:52.720,01:29:54.388,Now you're sounding like Einar.
01:29:54.847,01:29:56.432,I am like Einar.
01:29:59.227,01:30:00.686,What do you want me to do?
01:30:01.229,01:30:03.022,I want you to go away.
01:30:03.481,01:30:04.524,Really?
01:30:12.406,01:30:14.575,"No, I... Sorry."
01:31:23.477,01:31:28.232,"We're having to give her a great deal of morphine, of course, so that's to be expected."
01:31:33.988,01:31:35.448,It only makes it worse.
01:31:36.240,01:31:37.366,"Oh, God."
01:31:38.284,01:31:39.368,Breathe.
01:31:40.453,01:31:41.579,Breathe.
01:31:41.746,01:31:43.247,Breathe.
01:31:49.754,01:31:50.755,I'm here.
01:31:59.889,01:32:00.932,It's all right.
01:32:01.807,01:32:03.017,I'm here now.
01:32:07.855,01:32:08.898,Lili.
01:32:30.503,01:32:33.756,I can feel myself getting better when I listen to your pencil.
01:32:40.388,01:32:43.182,You've always sketched me better than I was.
01:32:45.518,01:32:47.353,"But what you draw, I become."
01:32:50.856,01:32:52.525,You made me beautiful.
01:32:54.735,01:32:56.612,And now you're making me strong.
01:33:00.783,01:33:02.326,Such power in you.
01:33:09.709,01:33:11.961,"Shall we go back to Denmark, then, Gerda?"
01:33:14.046,01:33:15.464,Shall we go home?
01:33:34.567,01:33:35.776,Lili!
01:33:36.068,01:33:37.069,You're late.
01:33:40.072,01:33:41.532,And your pills.
01:33:42.450,01:33:45.328,"Every two hours, and I need to eat something first."
01:33:45.578,01:33:47.371,I have some macaroons in my bag all ready.
01:33:49.540,01:33:50.583,And these.
01:33:52.251,01:33:53.419,Only if you need them.
01:34:01.761,01:34:02.803,Good luck.
01:34:13.230,01:34:16.692,making a purchase at Fonnesbech's is not merely shopping.
01:34:16.901,01:34:18.319,It's an experience.
01:34:19.236,01:34:20.780,"You lived in Paris, yes?"
01:34:21.572,01:34:22.573,Yes.
01:34:26.118,01:34:28.287,We're here to perform.
01:34:34.585,01:34:39.507,"In Paris, you see, a lady would never dream of spraying the scent directly onto herself."
01:34:39.632,01:34:44.678,"She... She would spray it in the air, and then she'd walk through it."
01:34:44.762,01:34:46.389,-Oh. -Voila.
01:34:48.307,01:34:49.433,You try.
01:35:08.119,01:35:09.453,That's so unfair.
01:35:09.537,01:35:13.124,You've got the sweetest tooth and the narrowest hips in the whole store.
01:35:13.207,01:35:15.209,"How do you manage it, eating so much sugar?"
01:35:15.292,01:35:17.211,The trick is you eat nothing else.
01:35:17.294,01:35:18.838,-See you tomorrow. -See you tomorrow.
01:35:21.549,01:35:22.967,"-Bye, Lili. -Bye."
01:35:32.184,01:35:36.397,"You know, one night last week, I had the strangest dream."
01:35:37.273,01:35:38.274,What was it?
01:35:38.441,01:35:39.942,I dreamed you were getting married.
01:35:46.323,01:35:47.825,Do you think I ever will?
01:35:48.242,01:35:49.577,Who knows?
01:35:49.702,01:35:52.371,So many strange things have happened.
01:35:54.123,01:35:55.666,"I do want to, Gerda."
01:35:58.043,01:36:01.464,"It's not so long ago we were married, you and me."
01:36:04.467,01:36:06.010,You and Einar.
01:36:09.680,01:36:11.098,I know it was Einar.
01:36:11.265,01:36:12.475,But really...
01:36:14.602,01:36:17.354,It was you and me.
01:36:39.043,01:36:40.336,Lili.
01:36:43.756,01:36:45.216,Is it really you?
01:36:46.342,01:36:47.635,I believe so.
01:36:52.806,01:36:55.643,"So, what you're suggesting..."
01:36:57.811,01:36:59.772,"Is that, uh, a doctor..."
01:37:02.066,01:37:03.359,Intervened.
01:37:03.442,01:37:05.569,To correct a mistake in nature.
01:37:06.529,01:37:08.072,He made you a woman.
01:37:08.364,01:37:10.533,"No, God made me a woman."
01:37:10.616,01:37:11.951,But the doctor... He...
01:37:12.117,01:37:16.830,The doctor is curing me of the sickness that was my disguise.
01:37:20.834,01:37:22.711,A real woman.
01:37:39.436,01:37:42.565,You're going to need a new notebook if you carry on like that.
01:37:42.648,01:37:47.528,"When Warnekros suggested I keep a diary, I thought I'd never have anything to write."
01:37:49.280,01:37:52.700,"It does help, just to make sense of things."
01:37:53.117,01:37:54.785,Maybe I should try it.
01:38:00.457,01:38:01.500,So...
01:38:02.835,01:38:04.878,Do you enjoy working at Fonnesbech's?
01:38:05.379,01:38:06.922,"For now, at least."
01:38:07.339,01:38:09.341,I do enjoy sort of being part of it.
01:38:10.009,01:38:11.176,You never think of painting?
01:38:14.805,01:38:15.806,You might be good at it.
01:38:15.889,01:38:18.392,"Gerda, I want to be a woman, not a painter."
01:38:19.685,01:38:21.812,"Well, people have been known to do both."
01:38:26.525,01:38:29.111,I'm curious to see what you would paint.
01:38:29.445,01:38:31.697,That's all. Sometimes it's hard to know what's in your...
01:38:31.905,01:38:34.241,Didn't you just take one of those a minute ago?
01:38:34.450,01:38:36.076,"Gerda, I know what I'm doing."
01:38:40.205,01:38:42.124,I'm just going to get some fresh air.
01:38:43.667,01:38:48.213,"You know, sometimes I do wonder why you let me go through all this, if you thought that everything would be the same afterwards."
01:38:48.297,01:38:49.840,I didn't.
01:38:50.716,01:38:52.718,But I promised Einar that I would take care of you.
01:38:52.801,01:38:55.095,"For goodness' sakes, Gerda, Einar is dead."
01:38:55.471,01:38:57.389,We both have to accept that.
01:38:58.390,01:39:01.477,"You took care of me, but now I have to take care of myself."
01:39:01.560,01:39:03.646,I have to have a life of my own.
01:39:05.731,01:39:07.524,And you need to do the same.
01:39:11.153,01:39:12.154,"Come on, Hvap."
01:39:28.420,01:39:29.421,"Uh, yes."
01:39:30.673,01:39:31.840,In London.
01:39:33.342,01:39:34.385,"Uh, is it urgent?"
01:39:34.968,01:39:36.387,"No, that's fine."
01:39:37.429,01:39:38.681,Just tell him...
01:39:40.933,01:39:42.976,Just say it's a beautiful day in Copenhagen.
01:40:15.050,01:40:17.803,It's not what you think. Henrik's homosexual.
01:40:17.970,01:40:19.513,There's nothing between us.
01:40:21.640,01:40:23.642,I should have told you that I'd seen him.
01:40:24.059,01:40:25.394,"No, you shouldn't."
01:40:26.103,01:40:27.688,"He's a friend, Gerdie, someone to talk to."
01:40:28.313,01:40:29.857,Because you can't talk to me.
01:40:31.984,01:40:33.819,I've made a decision.
01:40:35.320,01:40:37.489,I'm going back to Dresden for the second operation.
01:40:38.157,01:40:39.158,That's too soon.
01:40:39.241,01:40:40.743,"No... No, it's time."
01:40:41.160,01:40:42.953,I need to finish what I started.
01:40:43.120,01:40:44.163,You're not strong enough.
01:40:44.246,01:40:46.415,Professor Warnekros thinks that I am.
01:40:47.249,01:40:48.667,Warnekros?
01:40:48.792,01:40:50.294,Warnekros hasn't seen you.
01:40:50.377,01:40:51.587,"I've made up my mind, Gerda."
01:40:52.963,01:40:54.089,It could kill you.
01:40:54.173,01:40:56.341,I'm going on Friday. Will you come with me?
01:41:00.637,01:41:02.389,I won't help you to hurt yourself.
01:41:20.365,01:41:21.533,"Gerda, will you come?"
01:41:43.806,01:41:45.808,This will be harder than the first operation.
01:41:47.434,01:41:48.644,You understand that?
01:41:49.853,01:41:52.314,"Yes, I do."
01:41:54.817,01:41:56.693,It's complex surgery.
01:41:58.862,01:42:01.824,And I will sleep all the way through it.
01:42:05.202,01:42:06.286,"Yes, you will."
01:42:06.370,01:42:08.455,And you'll be there when I wake up.
01:42:11.333,01:42:12.334,Of course.
01:42:13.627,01:42:15.754,I want a husband who looks just like you.
01:42:19.591,01:42:20.634,Um...
01:42:21.051,01:42:23.053,Maybe a child one day.
01:42:27.432,01:42:28.851,Like a real woman.
01:42:30.686,01:42:32.104,One step at a time.
01:42:39.862,01:42:41.947,Get some rest. Good night.
01:42:54.918,01:42:56.461,Are you still angry with me?
01:42:57.880,01:42:59.631,I'm not angry with you.
01:43:01.258,01:43:03.093,I'm worried about you.
01:43:04.928,01:43:06.972,"You heard my wish, Gerda."
01:43:08.807,01:43:10.642,When no one else could hear me...
01:43:11.685,01:43:13.270,You did.
01:43:18.191,01:43:19.192,Come.
01:43:20.235,01:43:21.820,We both need our rest.
01:43:22.863,01:43:24.323,I'll sleep on the chair there.
01:43:26.074,01:43:28.493,"-No, off to your little hotel. -I don't mind."
01:43:28.577,01:43:30.078,"Here, take this."
01:43:30.162,01:43:31.663,Because there's a chill in the air.
01:43:34.583,01:43:36.668,-No. -Please.
01:43:36.960,01:43:39.254,You have it. For now.
01:43:40.881,01:43:42.341,I'm going to be fine.
01:43:43.634,01:43:44.635,Yes.
01:43:58.148,01:43:59.316,Good night.
01:44:51.368,01:44:52.703,"Uh, room nine, please."
01:44:54.162,01:44:55.330,Thank you.
01:45:01.962,01:45:03.046,Hans.
01:45:14.182,01:45:15.684,It's all right.
01:45:15.934,01:45:18.437,Everything will be all right.
01:45:40.250,01:45:41.460,It's time.
01:46:03.815,01:46:05.317,"Swab, quick."
01:46:15.452,01:46:17.913,Professor Warnekros would like a word.
01:46:21.083,01:46:22.751,She lost a lot of blood.
01:46:22.834,01:46:25.504,Now we are struggling to keep the fever down.
01:46:25.796,01:46:28.256,"There's a chance it might burn itself out, but..."
01:46:32.677,01:46:34.054,I have to be honest.
01:46:35.639,01:46:37.099,The prognosis is not...
01:46:45.357,01:46:47.359,It's all right. Shh.
01:46:59.246,01:47:00.622,Shh.
01:47:32.863,01:47:33.864,Lili.
01:47:50.630,01:47:51.965,"How are you, Lili?"
01:48:01.266,01:48:02.350,I am...
01:48:03.768,01:48:06.188,Entirely myself.
01:48:10.358,01:48:11.985,"You had us worried there, you know?"
01:48:15.071,01:48:18.200,"Can we go outside, Gerda?"
01:48:21.286,01:48:22.579,Into the garden?
01:48:23.330,01:48:24.956,You should rest.
01:48:31.004,01:48:32.297,Please.
01:48:52.859,01:48:55.987,"You mustn't worry about me anymore, Gerda."
01:48:58.365,01:48:59.616,It's an old habit.
01:49:01.368,01:49:03.328,I'm slow to change.
01:49:08.458,01:49:11.127,How have I ever deserved such love?
01:49:18.176,01:49:21.054,There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.
01:49:22.389,01:49:23.390,No.
01:49:27.394,01:49:28.478,Last night...
01:49:30.730,01:49:33.650,I had the most beautiful dream.
01:49:37.529,01:49:42.450,I dreamed that I was a baby in my mother's arms.
01:49:45.954,01:49:47.956,And she looked down at me...
01:49:51.167,01:49:53.420,And she called me Lili.
01:49:56.214,01:49:57.757,Lili.
01:50:24.117,01:50:25.243,Lili?
01:50:34.502,01:50:36.087,Lili!
01:51:50.829,01:51:52.288,"No, leave it!"
01:51:58.461,01:52:00.004,Let it fly.
