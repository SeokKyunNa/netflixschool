00:07:58.917,00:08:00.250,Okja!
00:08:03.542,00:08:05.250,"Okja, what are you doing?"
00:08:09.333,00:08:11.000,Look at all the fish here!
00:08:20.667,00:08:22.750,I want fish stew today!
00:08:59.917,00:09:01.625,What? Now?
00:09:03.292,00:09:04.292,Again?
00:10:18.750,00:10:19.792,Mija!
00:10:22.750,00:10:24.250,Is she not here yet?
00:10:24.792,00:10:25.833,Mija!
00:10:29.000,00:10:30.417,Where has she gone off to?
00:10:42.500,00:10:49.333,"Mija Joo of 37-1, Sanyang Town!"
00:10:50.083,00:10:55.500,Promptly return home for dinner. Mija!
00:10:58.500,00:11:00.958,Come home quick. Grandpa is starving!
00:12:18.625,00:12:21.042,Don't be scared. It's a shortcut.
00:13:10.000,00:13:11.500,No! Go back up!
00:14:26.833,00:14:28.083,Where are you?
00:16:29.958,00:16:34.833,Mundo from the office is coming to visit.
00:16:34.917,00:16:35.958,Mundo?
00:16:36.708,00:16:39.375,To collect the money for Okja?
00:16:39.917,00:16:43.833,I've already sent them the money.
00:16:43.917,00:16:46.542,"So Okja is ours now, right?"
00:16:47.458,00:16:48.625,Of course.
00:16:54.042,00:16:56.167,So why is he coming? Paperwork?
00:17:02.583,00:17:05.292,They said soccer would be on.
00:17:17.916,00:17:19.166,Son of a...
00:17:19.250,00:17:21.291,Great. Now we can buy a new TV.
00:17:22.625,00:17:25.000,This one's still fine.
00:17:26.917,00:17:28.042,Such a tightwad...
00:18:53.458,00:18:55.458,Welcome. Hard climb?
00:18:55.542,00:18:56.667,Good afternoon.
00:18:59.458,00:19:01.417,"Here, have some water."
00:19:02.625,00:19:04.500,I thought a bunch of you were coming.
00:19:05.750,00:19:07.125,They're behind me.
00:19:11.000,00:19:13.208,Always on top of her dental hygiene!
00:19:14.583,00:19:16.500,"Wait, wait. Let me out, Okja."
00:19:16.583,00:19:17.667,Mundo?
00:19:18.875,00:19:20.333,"Hello, Mundo."
00:19:20.417,00:19:22.417,-Did you brush your own teeth? -Yeah.
00:19:32.708,00:19:35.167,Retina Display!
00:19:35.250,00:19:36.375,Bring me the black box.
00:19:52.792,00:19:54.875,Does Okja eat and poop well?
00:19:55.458,00:19:58.375,"Yes, and she has a super-high metabolism."
00:19:59.541,00:20:01.208,Right. That's what the readings say.
00:20:27.333,00:20:30.333,"He... he's that guy! From TV, right?"
00:20:30.417,00:20:31.417,He is.
00:20:32.417,00:20:35.375,What was it? Animal Magic!
00:20:35.458,00:20:38.125,He's the very healthy guy!
00:20:59.583,00:21:01.458,He looks exactly like he does on TV.
00:21:25.458,00:21:26.708,"Excuse me, sir."
00:21:26.791,00:21:30.833,"If you don't mind, Dr. Johnny's a bit thirsty."
00:21:31.416,00:21:32.500,Thank you.
00:21:35.833,00:21:36.916,Wait. That's soju...
00:21:37.916,00:21:41.375,"Hey, that's mine..."
00:21:53.917,00:21:55.208,"Hey, Okja."
00:21:55.292,00:21:57.167,It's okay. Come on out.
00:21:57.250,00:21:59.917,That's it... Very good.
00:22:33.208,00:22:34.625,They're filming!
00:22:59.375,00:23:01.333,-What's he saying? -Dunno.
00:24:50.792,00:24:53.708,"Here. Autograph, please."
00:25:21.833,00:25:25.750,Mija. Let's go visit your mom and dad.
00:25:26.250,00:25:28.708,Now? I want to watch this.
00:25:28.792,00:25:31.583,They'll be doing this all day.
00:25:31.667,00:25:38.250,Your mom and dad appeared in my dream last night and said they missed you.
00:25:38.333,00:25:39.583,Come on.
00:25:48.042,00:25:49.042,Come quick.
00:25:50.708,00:25:51.833,It won't take long.
00:26:07.292,00:26:11.500,Who do you miss more?
00:26:12.208,00:26:14.583,Mom or dad?
00:26:16.125,00:26:17.583,I can't remember...
00:26:18.250,00:26:19.250,their faces.
00:26:22.500,00:26:27.583,It's been so many years.
00:26:28.208,00:26:32.792,Just the two of us in the mountains.
00:26:33.375,00:26:35.500,Not two. Three.
00:26:38.333,00:26:40.583,"Oh, sure. Three."
00:26:42.792,00:26:44.000,The three of us.
00:26:47.292,00:26:49.250,"Okja, too."
00:26:54.917,00:26:57.042,Our little fatty!
00:26:58.667,00:26:59.667,What's that?
00:27:00.708,00:27:01.666,This is...
00:27:02.417,00:27:03.583,a gold pig.
00:27:05.375,00:27:08.333,100% real gold.
00:27:09.167,00:27:17.708,"In the old days, the elders would give a gold pig to their daughters as a wedding gift."
00:27:18.542,00:27:21.833,"Mija, it's yours now."
00:27:22.583,00:27:23.583,Take it.
00:27:24.917,00:27:26.958,Why all of a sudden?
00:27:37.500,00:27:41.875,"Well, you're not getting married now..."
00:27:43.500,00:27:49.417,but... Okja is going far away...
00:27:50.583,00:27:57.250,so you can keep this gold pig instead.
00:27:58.416,00:27:59.625,What?
00:28:00.167,00:28:05.458,The pig competition's nearly over.
00:28:06.208,00:28:10.042,So they're taking all the pigs back to the company.
00:28:10.750,00:28:12.208,But Okja's ours.
00:28:12.917,00:28:14.375,We bought her from them.
00:28:15.042,00:28:17.208,You sent them the money!
00:28:18.333,00:28:19.625,Actually...
00:28:19.708,00:28:22.792,they wouldn't let me buy Okja.
00:28:22.875,00:28:27.000,So I bought you this gold pig instead.
00:28:28.667,00:28:30.167,What are you talking about?
00:28:35.042,00:28:36.625,"Hey, did you hear that?"
00:28:37.500,00:28:41.750,Your daughter raises her voice at me now.
00:28:46.708,00:28:47.750,Mija.
00:28:48.458,00:28:55.042,They say Okja was selected as the best pig.
00:28:55.125,00:28:58.542,They have plans for her in America.
00:28:58.625,00:28:59.917,America?
00:29:00.000,00:29:05.375,She'll spend the night at the Mirando building in Seoul.
00:29:05.958,00:29:10.958,"And tomorrow, she'll be on a plane to America."
00:29:13.125,00:29:17.375,She's a celebrity now!
00:29:21.958,00:29:22.958,Mija.
00:29:23.792,00:29:26.292,To be honest...
00:29:27.000,00:29:29.667,you're nearly a grown woman now.
00:29:29.750,00:29:36.542,I don't like you playing with that pig all day.
00:29:37.041,00:32:07.250,"You should go to town, meet a boy and-- You must be hungry."
00:32:08.333,00:32:11.583,"I made your favorite, chicken stew."
00:32:12.333,00:32:14.458,Go wash up so we can eat.
00:32:14.541,00:32:17.250,I put in this and that.
00:32:18.916,00:32:21.041,Everything that's good for you.
00:32:25.917,00:32:27.833,Where are you going?
00:32:28.792,00:32:29.792,Seoul.
00:32:30.542,00:32:31.583,What?
00:32:32.292,00:32:33.917,I'm going to bring Okja home.
00:32:34.458,00:32:36.125,Are you crazy?
00:32:36.208,00:32:40.125,Seoul? In the middle of the night?
00:32:40.208,00:32:43.000,You have no money to go to Seoul.
00:32:47.000,00:32:50.083,Stop! It's dangerous. Don't move!
00:32:50.167,00:32:51.792,"Oh, my God..."
00:32:52.750,00:32:54.417,"Oh, God..."
00:32:54.500,00:32:55.750,"Go away, you'll get hurt!"
00:33:00.375,00:33:03.042,Where do you think you're going?
00:33:03.125,00:33:04.792,You're not going anywhere!
00:33:10.000,00:33:11.041,Stop right there!
00:33:28.250,00:33:31.208,Blade shoulder! Loin! Spare rib! Hock!
00:33:31.833,00:33:32.666,Got it?
00:33:34.833,00:33:38.000,This is what will happen to her.
00:33:38.083,00:33:40.333,This is Okja's fate!
00:33:41.042,00:33:42.167,Fate!
00:33:44.125,00:33:45.125,Mija.
00:33:51.416,00:33:53.083,Mija! Mija!
00:33:56.042,00:33:57.083,Mija!
00:33:58.667,00:33:59.667,Mija!
00:34:01.791,00:34:03.375,Mija!
00:35:23.792,00:35:25.792,Excuse me!
00:35:35.875,00:35:37.083,I'm here for Okja!
00:35:38.625,00:35:40.916,Use the phone.
00:35:57.083,00:35:59.125,"Hey, could you come to the lobby?"
00:36:01.333,00:36:05.375,"No, some kid is here. She wants me to open the door."
00:36:05.458,00:36:08.000,Please state the name you are looking for.
00:36:08.708,00:36:10.833,M-U-N-D-O.
00:36:10.916,00:36:12.583,"Sorry, please speak clearly."
00:36:13.250,00:36:16.750,You can't just send anybody up here.
00:36:18.375,00:36:20.291,"Screen these people, okay?"
00:36:20.375,00:36:23.125,M-U-N-D-O!
00:36:25.875,00:36:27.125,Excuse me!
00:36:29.750,00:36:30.833,Excuse me!
00:36:59.541,00:37:01.000,What the...
00:37:10.625,00:37:13.167,You little bitch! Hey!
00:37:17.125,00:37:18.541,Mundo!
00:37:37.291,00:37:38.208,Hey!
00:37:38.292,00:37:39.667,You little shit!
00:37:39.750,00:37:42.708,-Stay where you are! -Hey! Stop!
00:37:47.167,00:37:49.542,Just open the door!
00:37:50.666,00:37:53.208,Open the door so we can talk.
00:37:53.292,00:37:54.292,Hey!
00:37:55.750,00:37:58.083,Open the damn door.
00:38:06.083,00:38:09.917,"Come on, you guys. Stop taking photos, okay? This is classified."
00:38:10.000,00:38:12.500,These are direct orders from HQ in America.
00:38:12.583,00:38:14.458,No photos!
00:38:14.542,00:38:19.208,I don't want to see anything on Instagram or Facebook. Okay?
00:38:22.083,00:38:24.666,"Okja, I'm here! Okja!"
00:38:24.750,00:38:27.167,Let's talk! Where are you going?
00:38:28.125,00:38:29.083,"Wait! No, stop!"
00:38:46.458,00:38:50.292,Look how tall the truck is! Right?
00:38:54.625,00:38:55.667,Are you new here?
00:39:00.833,00:39:02.125,Call the police!
00:39:02.208,00:39:03.833,Wait! Stop! Damn it!
00:40:09.666,00:40:13.041,What does that say? 4.2...
00:40:13.958,00:40:17.542,"This isn't taller than 4.2 meters, is it? Is it?"
00:40:24.208,00:40:28.333,Do you have a license to drive this thing?
00:40:28.416,00:40:29.541,A commercial license?
00:40:36.666,00:40:40.166,"Wait! Hey! Come on, now! Hey, no!"
00:40:54.375,00:40:56.708,What now? What's that noise?
00:40:57.875,00:40:58.875,What's that?
00:41:09.625,00:41:11.208,What the hell?
00:41:17.000,00:41:18.375,Nice to meet you.
00:41:19.416,00:41:20.916,We're not terrorists!
00:41:21.750,00:41:22.833,What?
00:41:22.916,00:41:24.250,We don't like violence!
00:41:25.000,00:41:26.875,We don't want to hurt you!
00:41:26.958,00:41:30.250,Stop... stop the truck!
00:41:31.666,00:41:33.083,What the hell is he saying?
00:41:33.166,00:41:34.333,Stop...
00:41:36.458,00:41:37.500,What?
00:42:01.541,00:42:02.625,What's going on?
00:42:56.667,00:42:59.000,Hello? Police?
00:42:59.083,00:43:01.125,Terrorists! There are terrorists here!
00:43:15.541,00:43:17.041,What's he writing?
00:43:19.458,00:43:21.583,Is this fucking amusing to you?
00:43:21.917,00:43:24.667,It's not mine. It's company property.
00:44:19.042,00:44:21.583,They're leaving! Start the truck! Quick!
00:44:22.291,00:44:24.208,-Fuck it. -What?
00:44:24.291,00:44:27.791,What do I care? I'm leaving this shithole anyway.
00:44:29.875,00:44:30.917,You know what?
00:44:32.542,00:44:35.458,"I do have a commercial license, but I don't have workman's comp."
00:44:37.750,00:44:40.500,Insurance? You want insurance?
00:44:41.125,00:44:43.417,Then show some loyalty to the company!
00:44:43.625,00:44:45.541,This is what company loyalty looks like!
00:44:55.042,00:44:56.042,This way!
00:44:57.458,00:44:58.500,Go!
00:45:06.542,00:45:07.875,I'm sorry!
00:45:58.792,00:45:59.792,Move!
00:47:44.875,00:47:46.666,Animal Liberation Front?
00:47:48.708,00:47:51.458,We are good people. On your side.
00:48:11.667,00:48:13.000,Where are you?
00:48:19.666,00:48:21.583,Back door! Back door!
00:48:46.208,00:48:47.166,Stop!
00:49:06.833,00:49:08.875,Mija! Don't!
00:49:08.958,00:49:12.041,Don't do that!
00:49:12.125,00:49:13.875,Stop rubbing!
00:49:41.833,00:49:43.292,"Hey, baby, it's me."
00:49:44.708,00:49:47.666,What kind of body wash do we have?
00:49:48.500,00:49:49.791,Fruity Lucy Lemon?
00:50:14.958,00:50:16.167,He's Jay.
00:50:17.625,00:50:19.125,My name is K.

00:52:53.166,00:52:56.708,This is where they're really taking Okja.
00:55:58.208,00:56:01.250,Okja will become a hidden camera.
00:56:18.042,00:56:22.042,You want to send Okja to America?
00:56:22.875,00:56:23.875,To this laboratory?
00:57:00.541,00:57:04.583,"If you don't approve, we won't do the mission."
00:57:10.375,00:57:11.917,Take Okja back to the mountains.
00:58:06.708,00:58:08.041,Hey!
00:58:15.750,00:58:20.708,Mija! Try learning English. It opens new doors!
00:58:20.791,00:58:22.333,"Hey, wait! Mister!"
00:58:32.542,00:58:33.625,"Hey, you!"
00:58:33.708,00:58:35.125,Grab him!
00:58:36.000,00:58:38.125,He jumped! How did he do that?
00:58:39.292,00:58:41.625,"Hey, kid. It's dangerous."
00:58:41.708,00:58:43.500,Get out of there.
00:58:45.333,00:58:47.542,"Hey, kid. Hey, come out!"
01:07:17.125,01:07:20.958,"At this rate, she'll be doing Mirando commercials."
01:07:21.042,01:07:23.417,-It's very likely! -Thank you!
01:07:23.500,01:07:24.958,-Mija! -Mija.
01:07:25.042,01:07:27.208,Everything is worked out! Don't worry about a thing.
01:07:27.292,01:07:29.458,Let's take a photo for our company Twitter.
01:07:29.542,01:07:30.625,Hold this.
01:07:33.833,01:07:35.458,Get Okja on the phone now!
01:07:35.541,01:07:37.166,I want to know how she's doing.
01:07:37.250,01:07:38.541,On the phone? With a pig?
01:07:50.583,01:07:52.625,Hasn't Okja landed yet?
01:07:52.708,01:07:54.542,Can we phone her now?
01:07:54.625,01:07:56.625,"Let's take a picture first, then call her."
01:07:56.708,01:07:58.250,-Really? -Of course.
01:08:02.542,01:08:08.292,In the plane... If you get airsick...
01:08:09.458,01:08:11.250,chew the end of this.
01:08:11.333,01:08:12.708,"Like this, okay?"
01:08:12.792,01:08:15.375,Look at me.
01:08:15.458,01:08:17.167,Mija. Take this.
01:08:30.208,01:17:13.250,CONGRATULATIONS! BEST SUPER PIG COMPETITION ENGLISH FOR BEGINNERS Okja! Are you okay?
01:17:13.333,01:17:15.541,Okja! Okja! What did you say?
01:17:15.625,01:17:16.875,I can't hear you!
01:17:19.583,01:17:21.167,Okja! Are you okay?
01:19:48.000,01:19:49.042,Don't touch it!
01:19:50.083,01:19:52.375,"Okay, okay. The fanny pack is fine."
01:20:14.000,01:20:15.375,Not until I see Okja.
01:20:30.166,01:20:34.500,I don't care about that. I want to see Okja first. Or I won't cooperate.
01:39:05.250,01:39:06.250,What is it?
01:39:16.458,01:39:18.417,Just tell me where she is!
01:40:54.250,01:40:56.333,No! Don't go inside!
01:45:05.792,01:45:06.958,"No, wait!"
01:49:48.208,01:49:49.583,Did you pick a lot?
01:49:49.667,01:49:50.667,Yes.
01:49:55.541,01:49:57.125,Don't scare the chickens.
01:59:35.292,01:59:36.292,Hey.
01:59:46.125,01:59:48.833,Hey. Quit bugging her.
00:00:45.167,00:00:48.500,Welcome to my inauguration!
00:00:48.583,00:00:52.250,"I'm Lucy, Lucy Mirando, of the Mirando Corporation."
00:00:52.333,00:00:56.125,Welcome to my grandfather's old factory.
00:00:56.208,00:01:02.708,"Now, I know, we all know, that Grandpa Mirando was a terrible man."
00:01:04.875,00:01:09.875,We know of the atrocities he committed in this space.
00:01:10.625,00:01:16.417,We know these walls are stained with the blood of fine working men.
00:01:17.167,00:01:20.958,"But today, I reclaim this space..."
00:01:22.042,00:01:25.000,to tell you a beautiful story.
00:01:26.167,00:01:28.875,Now the rotten CEOs are gone.
00:01:28.958,00:01:35.167,"It's Mirando's new era with me, and with new core values, environment and life."
00:01:35.250,00:01:36.417,Awesome.
00:01:36.500,00:01:38.375,You're much more fun than the last chief executive.
00:01:38.458,00:01:42.083,"Well, former CEO Nancy's my sister, but, uh..."
00:01:42.167,00:01:43.458,we're very different people.
00:01:43.542,00:01:47.375,We have very different ways of being. We have very different business ethics.
00:01:47.875,00:01:49.958,But she's totally ignorant about humanity.
00:01:50.042,00:01:52.292,She lacks vision beyond her next round of golf.
00:01:53.667,00:01:56.500,The world's population is at seven billion.
00:01:56.583,00:02:04.042,"805 million human beings struggle with hunger every day, including 30 million right here in the United States."
00:02:04.125,00:02:08.083,"The world is running out of food, and we're not talking about it."
00:02:11.750,00:02:13.167,We needed a miracle.
00:02:14.208,00:02:15.208,And then we got one.
00:02:15.917,00:02:18.167,Say hello to a super piglet.
00:02:18.875,00:02:24.792,This beautiful and special little creature was miraculously discovered on one Chilean farm.
00:02:25.417,00:02:29.708,We brought this precious girl to the Mirando Ranch in Arizona.
00:02:30.000,00:02:38.375,"Our scientists have been raising her with love and care ever since, observing and performing various studies."
00:02:38.666,00:02:45.417,"And we've successfully reproduced 26 miracle piglets by nonforced, natural mating."
00:02:47.833,00:02:50.667,They are like nothing on Earth.
00:02:54.625,00:03:03.167,"Last week, we sent the 26 super piglets to the 26 countries where the Mirando offices are located."
00:03:04.000,00:03:08.083,Each one was given to an esteemed local farmer.
00:03:08.167,00:03:16.958,"I have asked each farmer to raise their special guest, honoring traditional techniques unique to their respective cultures."
00:03:17.042,00:03:24.292,My top scientists in the Mirando branch offices will be on hand to offer whatever support is required.
00:03:25.958,00:03:31.542,These little piggies will be the ancestors of a whole new species.
00:03:32.125,00:03:34.000,Mama Nature's gift.
00:03:34.083,00:03:36.958,A revolution in the livestock industry.
00:03:37.833,00:03:41.167,And now we have a competition!
00:03:45.792,00:03:51.583,"One local farmer will raise the biggest, most beautiful and special one."
00:03:51.667,00:03:55.417,The ultimate super pig! But who will it be?
00:03:58.458,00:04:02.542,"Hmm. I'm not an expert, but I know someone who is."
00:04:03.250,00:04:11.833,"TV's most beloved zoologist and veterinarian, and the new face of the Mirando Corporation, Dr. Johnny Wilcox!"
00:04:12.500,00:04:15.375,Who said a brilliant scientist can't be fun?
00:04:17.542,00:04:20.333,"See, everybody wants to eat him up."
00:04:20.417,00:04:21.583,Aw!
00:04:22.250,00:04:32.042,"When the competition reaches its climax, Dr. Johnny will crown the winner at a Magical Animals live telecast right here in New York City."
00:04:32.125,00:04:35.875,And that is when we will unveil our super pigs to the world.
00:04:35.958,00:04:37.667,How long will the wait be?
00:04:37.750,00:04:40.583,When do we get to see the big pig with our own eyes?
00:04:42.333,00:04:43.667,Ten years.
00:04:45.542,00:04:47.667,"Jesus Christ, I'll be dead by then."
00:04:54.541,00:05:05.250,"Our super pigs will not only be big and beautiful, they will also leave a minimal footprint on the environment, consume less feed and produce less excretions."
00:05:05.333,00:05:06.875,And most importantly...
00:05:08.792,00:05:10.958,they need to taste fucking good.
00:06:18.833,00:06:19.833,It's okay.
00:06:25.542,00:06:26.708,Not too hard!
00:08:19.375,00:08:20.625,Okja!
00:14:04.625,00:14:05.625,Okja!
00:14:12.667,00:14:14.000,Okja!
00:14:20.292,00:14:21.625,Okja!
00:14:30.542,00:14:31.750,Okja!
00:14:32.583,00:14:34.208,Okja!
00:14:59.000,00:15:00.042,Okja.
00:17:06.708,00:17:07.708,Hmm?
00:17:16.875,00:17:17.833,Huh?
00:17:19.250,00:17:21.292,Great. Now we can buy a new TV.
00:19:07.708,00:19:08.792,Okja!
00:19:35.250,00:19:36.583,Bring me the black box.
00:20:17.542,00:20:18.542,All right!
00:20:21.250,00:20:23.500,"I'm fucking here, God damn it!"
00:20:44.625,00:20:47.208,Japan's one was five minutes from the airport.
00:20:48.542,00:20:56.333,"And you... I notice that you had to leave the fucking mountaintop super pig till the end, because you knew that the climb would rile me."
00:20:56.417,00:20:58.792,"Well, guess what? I'm riled."
00:21:11.750,00:21:12.833,Can somebody...
00:21:13.458,00:21:15.750,Can somebody at least bring me some water?
00:21:15.833,00:21:19.042,Seeing as I'm about to be filmed for fucking television!
00:21:19.125,00:21:21.792,And not sparkling water. I don't want to belch my way through the broadcast.
00:21:21.875,00:21:22.917,Get him some water.
00:21:23.000,00:21:25.375,I don't think they have sparkling water here.
00:22:20.792,00:22:22.625,"Well, fucking film me, Jennifer!"
00:22:23.875,00:22:25.458,You can't fake these emotions.
00:22:27.667,00:22:29.375,Get him his uniform. Quick.
00:22:36.708,00:22:38.833,"Oh, that's it. Is your... Mundo?"
00:22:38.917,00:22:42.417,"Mundo, get out of the shot, please. Thank you very much. That's it."
00:22:42.500,00:22:45.250,"And, uh, his hat. Get his hat. Looking good, Dr. Johnny."
00:22:45.333,00:22:46.667,That's it. Everything's gonna be okay.
00:22:46.750,00:22:49.042,"Mundo, get out of the shot. Thank you very much."
00:22:49.125,00:22:50.417,And... roll.
00:22:51.625,00:22:59.250,"Ten years ago, 26 local farmers from 26 far-flung countries were each given a super piglet. This year, I traveled to each..."
00:23:01.375,00:23:11.000,"...one of those 26 farms to decide who will be invited to The Best Super Pig Fest in New York City, where it will be unveiled to the world."
00:23:12.292,00:23:14.292,You've done an incredible job.
00:23:14.375,00:23:15.833,Thank you.
00:23:15.917,00:23:17.083,Pan to the old man!
00:23:20.792,00:23:25.958,"Ever since she was little, I've always been fascinated with Okja and her monthly health reports and data."
00:23:26.042,00:23:35.542,"I've only known her through numbers and graphs and pictures, but seeing her here today, and studying her with my own eyes and hands, she amazes me even more."
00:23:35.625,00:23:42.625,This is it. The moment of mutual trust between Mirando's very own Dr. Johnny and the esteemed local farmer.
00:23:48.458,00:23:50.417,She's truly exceptional.
00:23:53.292,00:23:56.000,How did you do it? What were your methods?
00:24:03.708,00:24:07.417,He just let her run around. How beguiling!
00:24:07.500,00:24:10.542,"Show the sash to the camera, Jennifer, and go!"
00:24:14.125,00:24:16.542,-Ready for the festival in New York City? -New York?
00:24:23.875,00:24:24.958,Very healthy.
00:24:27.542,00:24:28.833,"One more sash, please."
00:24:36.500,00:24:42.667,"A special sash for a special little lady, who I'm sure helped raise this super pig in her own special little way."
00:24:43.625,00:24:46.417,And cut. Get some cutaways of the pig!
00:24:50.791,00:24:53.500,"Here. Autograph, please."
00:24:56.542,00:24:58.958,The kids at home don't really appreciate me anymore.
00:25:01.958,00:25:05.083,I'm sorry if I was a little grumpy when I first came to the farm.
00:25:05.167,00:25:07.750,"But, you know, being a television presenter can be stressful."
00:25:08.458,00:25:11.708,I always have to be on...
00:25:13.000,00:25:15.542,now that I'm the face of the Mirando Corporation.
00:26:35.583,00:26:36.708,Huh?
00:26:53.458,00:26:54.833,Ta-da!
00:27:00.708,00:27:01.708,This is...
00:29:05.958,00:29:10.917,"And tomorrow, she'll be on a plane to America."
00:29:37.042,00:31:06.583,"You should go to town, meet a boy and-- Okja..."
00:31:29.750,00:31:30.875,Hmm!
00:33:10.000,00:33:11.042,Stop right there!
00:33:31.833,00:33:32.667,Got it?
00:35:38.625,00:35:40.917,Use the phone.
00:35:57.042,00:35:59.083,"Hey, could you come to the lobby?"
00:36:18.375,00:36:20.292,"Screen these people, okay?"
00:37:58.166,00:37:59.125,Okja!
00:38:02.666,00:38:05.250,Okja! Okja!
00:38:22.083,00:38:24.667,"Okja, I'm here! Okja!"
00:40:09.666,00:40:13.000,What does that say? 4.2...
00:40:19.041,00:40:19.875,Oh!
00:40:28.417,00:40:29.542,A commercial license?
00:40:36.667,00:40:40.167,"Wait! Hey! Come on, now! Hey, no!"
00:40:48.208,00:40:50.958,Okja! Okja!
00:42:08.917,00:42:12.417,Buckle! Buckle!
00:42:14.458,00:42:16.417,"'Cause we're gonna come on board now, right?"
00:42:16.500,00:42:21.875,But we're not gonna hurt you. You'll be okay. Yes? Okay.
00:43:42.625,00:43:43.667,Okja!
00:44:09.458,00:44:10.625,Catch her!
00:44:13.500,00:44:14.666,Everybody in the van!
00:44:24.292,00:44:27.792,What do I care? I'm leaving this shithole anyway.
00:44:27.875,00:44:28.833,Huh?
00:48:05.167,00:48:06.333,"-This way! -Guys, be careful!"
00:48:14.458,00:48:15.583,There! Right there!
00:48:16.875,00:48:18.500,Back door! Go to the back door!
00:48:18.583,00:48:19.500,Hey!
00:49:23.708,00:49:25.333,"And eco-friendly, you know?"
00:49:48.500,00:49:49.792,Fruity Lucy Lemon?
00:49:53.375,00:49:55.000,-I don't care. Sounds creepy. -I'm not creepy.
00:49:55.083,00:49:57.167,That's not... That's my voice. That's my actual voice.
00:50:11.125,00:50:12.417,My name is Jay.
00:50:21.750,00:50:22.750,I'm Red.
00:50:25.083,00:50:27.250,-Silver. -I'm Blond.
00:50:38.042,00:50:39.750,We are animal lovers.
00:50:43.333,00:50:46.625,"We rescue animals from slaughterhouses, zoos, labs."
00:50:46.708,00:50:49.667,We tear down cages and set them free.
00:50:49.750,00:50:53.708,This is why we rescued Okja.
00:51:09.500,00:51:14.792,"For 40 years, our group has liberated animals from places of abuse."
00:51:18.583,00:51:20.208,-Is that it? -Yeah.
00:51:22.208,00:51:23.041,Go on.
00:51:24.375,00:51:27.833,-It's very important she gets every word. -It's all right. That's it.
00:51:27.917,00:51:31.375,We inflict economic damage on those who profit from their misery.
00:51:31.458,00:51:33.875,We reveal their atrocities to the public.
00:51:33.958,00:51:37.458,"And we never harm anyone, human or nonhuman."
00:51:37.542,00:51:40.250,That is our 40-year credo.
00:52:00.125,00:52:01.708,"-Whoa! -Are you okay, Silver?"
00:52:01.792,00:52:03.000,I'm fine.
00:52:03.750,00:52:05.875,-You okay? -I'm good. I'm... I'm good.
00:52:07.917,00:52:08.917,"No, he's, uh..."
00:52:09.958,00:52:12.958,still trying to leave the smallest footprint on the planet that he can.
00:52:13.042,00:52:15.333,All food production is exploitative.
00:52:16.583,00:52:17.792,-Try this. -Mmm-mmm.
00:52:17.875,00:52:19.167,Come on. It's just a tomato.
00:52:19.250,00:52:21.375,Ripened in ethylene gas. Transported in trucks.
00:52:21.458,00:52:25.667,"I admire your conviction, Silver, but your pallid complexion concerns me."
00:52:30.125,00:52:32.167,How long have you and Okja lived together?
00:52:36.708,00:52:37.917,Since she was four.
00:53:00.833,00:53:03.792,This is the building where Okja was created.
00:53:16.167,00:53:20.625,She thinks she was born in Arizona and her mom in Chile.
00:53:20.708,00:53:24.708,Mija. Everything you believe you know about Okja is a lie.
00:53:25.333,00:53:29.333,Okja was created in this lab. So was her so-called mother.
00:53:30.583,00:53:35.333,This is the building where Mirando experiments on their genetically-mutated animals.
00:53:35.958,00:53:42.667,"Because genetic mutation is too dangerous, Mirando's been disguising it as natural, safe and non-GMO."
00:53:42.750,00:53:44.625,But that's a complete scam.
00:53:44.708,00:53:48.875,Millions of GM pigs are already lining up in front of slaughterhouses.
00:53:48.958,00:53:53.417,You and the other local farmers are just promotional devices for them.
00:53:53.500,00:53:55.292,Just a picturesque backdrop.
00:53:59.042,00:54:00.417,Promotion.
00:54:00.500,00:54:05.083,"Mirando know their consumers would be disgusted by the idea of eating mutant, GM foods."
00:54:05.750,00:54:15.708,"So ten years ago, their boss, Lucy Mirando, went inside the lab and dug around amongst all the disfigured creatures to find the 26 prettiest ones, like your Okja."
00:54:15.792,00:54:19.500,"And then, big fanfare, she sent them around the world."
00:54:19.583,00:54:26.208,"They've been frantically breeding their super pigs, and soon, the supermarkets will be filled with their flesh and organs."
00:54:26.292,00:54:29.625,"Dog food, hot dogs, bacon and jerky."
00:54:32.333,00:54:40.000,"But to do so, we need video from inside the lab, footage of the horrible atrocities being committed against the animals."
00:54:40.083,00:54:44.083,And there's a problem. The security is impenetrable.
00:54:44.667,00:54:47.417,But... there is a way.
00:54:49.000,00:54:52.417,Although we will only go ahead with it if you give us your consent.
00:54:52.500,00:54:56.417,"Jay. If this kid doesn't give her consent, what, we just abandon the mission?"
00:54:56.500,00:54:57.750,Is that what you're saying?
00:54:58.333,00:55:01.500,"'Cause, brother, we've come halfway around the world for this."
00:55:01.583,00:55:04.208,-We should get this done now. -Ugh! Don't be so selfish.
00:55:04.292,00:55:07.542,"This isn't about you or us, and she is Okja's family."
00:55:07.625,00:55:09.167,So of course we need her consent.
00:55:09.250,00:55:12.667,I will not harm her by forcing a mission upon her that she does not consent to.
00:55:12.750,00:55:15.750,"As members of the ALF, we are obliged to honor its credo."
00:55:15.833,00:55:20.167,We are going to abort because some guy from the 1970s wrote a fucking credo?
00:55:20.250,00:55:21.875,Is that what you're saying?
00:55:25.417,00:55:27.292,We make a movement strong.
00:55:27.375,00:55:31.125,"If that's how you feel, call yourself something else and not the ALF and get out of this truck."
00:55:32.667,00:55:38.083,"In order to expose Mirando, we need video from inside the lab."
00:55:38.167,00:55:39.958,And this is where Okja comes in.
00:55:41.292,00:55:44.625,The Mirando scientists are dying to run tests on her in their underground lab.
00:55:44.708,00:55:47.750,Their star super pig. Which is why we've made this.
00:55:49.500,00:55:52.417,"It looks exactly like the black box on her ear, right?"
00:55:53.333,00:55:58.125,Only this one can wirelessly send a video feed to us from inside the lab.
00:56:05.333,00:56:06.333,Okay.
00:56:12.041,00:56:17.958,"Rescue Okja, replace the black box and let Mirando retake Okja."
00:56:27.583,00:56:29.042,They wouldn't dare hurt her.
00:56:30.042,00:56:32.833,She needs to be perfect for their beauty pageant.
00:56:32.917,00:56:36.375,Whatever tests they do on her in there will need to be harmless.
00:56:36.458,00:56:40.417,We have a detailed plan on how to rescue her from the event in New York City.
00:56:40.500,00:56:42.625,We promise to bring her back to you.
00:56:45.917,00:56:50.750,"If our mission succeeds, we'll be able to shut down Mirando's super pig project completely."
00:56:51.750,00:56:56.625,And we'll be saving millions of super pigs like Okja from death.
00:56:57.208,00:56:59.708,But we won't do it without your approval.
00:57:07.458,00:57:08.708,What is your decision?
00:57:18.500,00:57:23.125,-Thank you so much. -This is a giant leap for animal kind.
00:57:24.875,00:57:25.875,Thank you.
00:57:53.208,00:57:57.417,"Move! Move! I'm gonna do it! Holy shit, I'm gonna do it!"
00:58:04.917,00:58:06.625,"Go, go, go, go, go, go."
00:58:08.125,00:58:10.458,"Okja, I'll see you in New York."
00:58:12.292,00:58:13.417,Till we meet again.
00:59:03.625,00:59:06.292,-Are you kidding me? -It's supposed to hold.
00:59:06.375,00:59:08.042,"You're a fucking joke-show, mate."
00:59:09.208,00:59:11.375,"-Fucking awesome, epic plan, man. -It's a Ziploc."
00:59:11.458,00:59:13.750,"-Fucking Ziploc, my ass. -It was supposed to hold."
00:59:13.833,00:59:14.833,Seriously?
00:59:14.916,00:59:17.791,-You okay? -Yeah. Yeah.
00:59:32.458,00:59:38.000,Mirando employees were securing their super pig when a young girl suddenly stepped in and tried to stop them.
00:59:38.083,00:59:45.542,These extraordinary events began earlier in the day with a highly-organized pignapping attempt made by the Animal Liberation Front.
00:59:45.625,00:59:49.375,"I wouldn't worry too much, Luce. The ALF technically failed."
00:59:49.458,00:59:51.083,They weren't even able to take the product.
00:59:51.167,00:59:55.000,"Yeah, it's a kerfuffle over nothing. We shouldn't make a big deal out of it."
00:59:55.083,01:00:00.250,"It actually means our security here in the US is so airtight, they wouldn't even think about breaking in."
01:00:00.333,01:00:01.916,Which is why they went all the way to Korea.
01:00:02.000,01:00:08.583,"The ALF hasn't been in the headlines for a number of years, but they're back in the spotlight after today's chaotic events."
01:00:08.833,01:00:11.750,"Well, the good news is that the pig is on its way to New York now."
01:00:15.667,01:00:19.375,Significant damage to Mirando's stock price seems inevitable.
01:00:19.458,01:00:22.083,Yeah. Mirando is completely fucked.
01:00:22.167,01:00:25.125,"Mirando. That's your current employer, correct?"
01:00:25.208,01:00:27.583,Yup. But I don't care.
01:00:27.667,01:00:30.875,"They fucked, not me. They fucked up."
01:00:39.958,01:00:41.750,They're calling me a psychopath.
01:00:44.167,01:00:45.667,You're not a psychopath.
01:00:45.750,01:00:48.167,"They're the psychopaths. Right, Ms. Mirando?"
01:00:49.083,01:00:50.542,They're narcissists.
01:00:59.083,01:01:00.750,You're a psychopath.
01:01:00.833,01:01:04.667,Your sister was a psychopath. Your father was a psychopath.
01:01:04.750,01:01:08.750,"Well, Daddy was a psychopath, Frank. I mean, that's hardly an unfair slur."
01:01:11.125,01:01:12.833,"What did you do in the war, Daddy?"
01:01:13.417,01:01:16.417,I manufactured the napalm that made everybody's skin fall off.
01:01:18.875,01:01:21.625,And this is a man who called his child an idiot loser.
01:01:24.042,01:01:31.750,"Well, in fairness to your father, when he called you an idiot loser, you had just signed up for a course in California called Unleash Your Calling."
01:01:31.833,01:01:36.917,At a highly-respected institute for the advancement of human potential where many a forward-looking CEO go.
01:01:37.667,01:01:40.083,And you know what I was doing while I was at the institute?
01:01:40.167,01:01:45.042,I was visualizing new and better ways of doing business.
01:01:45.708,01:01:48.125,While my sister was CEO... What was the name of that lake?
01:01:48.208,01:01:49.417,Moose Lake.
01:01:49.500,01:01:55.792,"Moose Lake. While my sister was CEO, dumping so much toxic waste into Moose Lake that it exploded..."
01:01:55.875,01:01:58.708,"The only lake ever to explode. Well done, Nancy."
01:01:58.792,01:02:09.625,I was visualizing ways of turning the most hated agrochemical company in the world into the most likable miracle pig-rearing company.
01:02:09.708,01:02:11.708,And it's working! It's working!
01:02:11.792,01:02:15.125,It was working until last night.
01:02:15.208,01:02:17.000,Until six hours ago.
01:02:17.583,01:02:23.375,The synthesis of old Mirando and new Mirando was impeccable.
01:02:24.875,01:02:30.667,"I took nature and science, and I synthesized."
01:02:31.292,01:02:33.083,And everyone loved it.
01:02:33.875,01:02:37.292,You remember what the New York Times said about our super pigs?
01:02:37.375,01:02:39.208,"Intriguing, right?"
01:02:39.292,01:02:42.917,Slate: Lucy Mirando is pulling off the impossible.
01:02:43.000,01:02:47.500,She is making us fall in love with a creature that we are already looking forward to eating.
01:02:47.583,01:02:51.250,"I mean, these are journalists who never write about pigs."
01:02:51.333,01:02:54.667,They never write about pigs! They wrote about our pigs.
01:02:55.333,01:02:56.917,Ten years in planning!
01:02:57.000,01:03:00.667,On the cusp of a product launch that will feed millions!
01:03:00.750,01:03:02.292,And what happens?
01:03:02.375,01:03:08.917,"We get tangled up in this terrorism thing, and somehow we end up being the ones who look bad."
01:03:11.708,01:03:15.125,-We don't? Open that thing! -Yup.
01:03:17.583,01:03:19.292,"No, rewind. Rewind."
01:03:21.208,01:03:22.458,Rewind!
01:03:23.292,01:03:24.292,"Okay, play."
01:03:27.792,01:03:30.750,of a local farmer selected by Mirando CEO...
01:03:32.833,01:03:34.000,That's it.
01:03:34.917,01:03:36.042,That's the image.
01:03:36.750,01:03:39.625,That is the image that is gonna destroy us.
01:03:40.750,01:03:42.625,Who are those morons?
01:03:42.708,01:03:44.250,Find out and fire them.
01:03:46.125,01:03:47.125,Sure.
01:03:48.125,01:03:50.000,Abusing that adorable girl.
01:03:50.833,01:03:53.667,And in the uniforms that I personally designed myself.
01:03:54.667,01:03:57.208,And shoving her best friend onto a truck.
01:04:04.750,01:04:06.000,That's gonna kill us.
01:04:07.250,01:04:08.875,Right there. That's it.
01:04:09.458,01:04:11.875,That image. We're dead.
01:04:50.417,01:04:53.000,"Lucy, may I ask you a question?"
01:04:54.750,01:04:58.000,"The girl. You're thinking of bringing her to New York, aren't you?"
01:04:58.917,01:05:00.417,I was about to say that!
01:05:00.500,01:05:02.500,"Yes, of course."
01:05:02.583,01:05:05.042,You'll invite her to The Best Super Pig Festival and...
01:05:05.708,01:05:07.208,A moving reunion!
01:05:08.208,01:05:13.625,The best super pig and the adorable farmer girl forced apart and somehow brought together on our stage.
01:05:13.708,01:05:14.958,"Brilliant, Lucy."
01:05:15.042,01:05:18.292,"An emotional reunion, and then they leave the stage together."
01:05:18.375,01:05:20.583,Hand in hand. Hand in trotter.
01:05:21.208,01:05:23.667,She can be the new face of the Mirando Corporation.
01:05:23.750,01:05:26.333,She can be the embodiment of the Mirando ideal.
01:05:26.417,01:05:28.792,"She's young, she's pretty, she's female."
01:05:28.875,01:05:32.000,She's eco-friendly and she's global! She's a godsend!
01:05:34.416,01:05:35.333,Hey!
01:05:39.042,01:05:41.542,She's not the face of the Mirando Corporation. I am.
01:05:43.250,01:05:45.667,You don't even know if she can do anything but cry.
01:05:46.333,01:05:48.375,Whereas I am loved...
01:05:50.542,01:05:52.042,all over the world.
01:05:52.500,01:05:55.791,Could you sit down and shut the fucking squeaking and whining?
01:06:02.333,01:06:03.417,You know...
01:06:10.667,01:06:12.583,I'm forcing you to do what?
01:06:16.333,01:06:18.833,To examine my options.
01:06:21.083,01:06:23.000,Go ahead. Examine them.
01:06:23.083,01:06:26.625,Are you examining them now? Have you finished examining them?
01:06:28.000,01:06:29.667,Sit. You're a deadbeat.
01:06:29.750,01:06:32.875,Your ratings are shit. Epic fail.
01:06:33.875,01:06:36.167,"Jennifer, get her a first class ticket."
01:06:36.250,01:06:39.333,Get her a passport. She probably hasn't got a passport. Get her a visa.
01:06:39.417,01:06:41.708,We'll pay for all the damage the super pig did in Korea.
01:06:41.792,01:06:42.958,Get an attorney on that.
01:06:43.042,01:06:46.667,"Don't force an image on her, like Benetton did with those Asian models."
01:06:46.750,01:06:49.542,"Oh, no. I have a much better idea."
01:06:56.542,01:06:59.292,"Okay, we got it all figured out. We got a strategy. We got a plan."
01:06:59.375,01:07:01.083,We're gonna think of it like a love story.
01:07:01.167,01:07:03.917,That's what we're gonna do. Hand those bits of paper out quickly.
01:07:04.000,01:07:06.125,We got a little girl running around the city all alone.
01:07:06.208,01:07:07.917,"We've got a big, big giant pig."
01:07:08.000,01:07:10.958,We gotta bring them back together because they miss each other.
01:07:11.042,01:07:12.083,Now they go to New York City.
01:07:12.167,01:07:14.333,"Look at her, so sweet. Cute. Totally gorgeous."
01:07:14.417,01:07:15.917,"Totally sexy. Hot, tiny, perfect."
01:07:35.542,01:07:36.917,I want to know how she's doing.
01:07:37.000,01:07:38.542,On the phone? With a pig?
01:07:41.125,01:07:44.208,"On Instagram, on YouTube, on Tumblr, on Facebook, on Twitter."
01:07:44.292,01:07:46.458,"Okja. Okja, the giant pig. She's, like, this big."
01:07:46.542,01:07:48.042,"She's, like, oh, my God. She's bigger."
01:07:48.125,01:07:49.750,"Yeah, she's got one big, giant nipple."
01:07:54.625,01:07:56.500,"Let's take a picture first, then call her."
01:08:30.208,01:09:12.708,"CONGRATULATIONS! BEST SUPER PIG COMPETITION ENGLISH FOR BEGINNERS Hey, Nance."
01:09:14.083,01:09:17.375,How's London? Is that rain? That can't be good for the golf.
01:09:17.458,01:09:19.208,Just letting you know I'm thinking of you.
01:09:19.292,01:09:20.667,"You're having a moment, I see."
01:09:20.750,01:09:24.750,"Yes, things are going super well. It's all a massive success."
01:09:24.833,01:09:26.042,Really?
01:09:26.125,01:09:29.917,They keep showing very unflattering pictures of you in the press.
01:09:30.000,01:09:33.792,Those ones of you as a fat child on Daddy's knee.
01:09:33.875,01:09:35.500,Such nasty remarks.
01:09:36.250,01:09:39.542,"All eyes are on you, aren't they, squeaky clean icon?"
01:09:41.167,01:09:47.792,I've sent you a reminder of the true face of the most powerful CEO Mirando has ever had.
01:09:48.208,01:09:49.208,"You go, girl."
01:10:06.083,01:10:07.500,We're seeing what Okja's seeing.
01:10:10.917,01:10:12.583,Enjoy this moment.
01:10:12.667,01:10:15.333,Because soon the whole world will know what we know.
01:10:15.917,01:10:19.000,"Oh, my God, Jay. We're about to change everything."
01:10:21.125,01:10:23.125,I'll put some distance between us and them.
01:10:23.708,01:10:25.833,We have to test how far the signal reaches.
01:10:54.125,01:10:56.375,-Okja gets to see everything. -Quiet.
01:11:22.125,01:11:25.125,Hi! Ah!
01:11:26.250,01:11:27.250,Ah!
01:11:28.292,01:11:29.625,We're reunited.
01:11:30.958,01:11:33.458,"In this wretched laboratory, no less."
01:11:33.542,01:11:36.083,Someone you're going to find very special.
01:11:36.167,01:11:38.792,Here is Alfonso!
01:11:40.250,01:11:41.583,Where is he?
01:11:41.667,01:11:44.833,I got a special treat for Lucy's star super pig.
01:11:46.792,01:11:48.292,"Hey! Chop, chop!"
01:11:54.833,01:11:57.167,"Alfonso, Okja!"
01:12:11.875,01:12:12.875,Yeah.
01:12:36.833,01:12:38.917,We should never have sent her there.
01:12:39.000,01:12:40.667,"Can you turn it off, please?"
01:12:42.250,01:12:43.250,No.
01:12:43.958,01:12:47.125,"No, we need to record this. We need to show this."
01:12:47.958,01:12:49.625,At least turn the volume down.
01:12:54.792,01:12:56.875,We didn't know they were gonna do this to her.
01:12:56.958,01:12:59.583,We didn't know they were gonna put her through this mating.
01:12:59.667,01:13:00.792,We suspected!
01:13:01.833,01:13:03.750,"Come on, we all suspected."
01:13:15.250,01:13:16.708,I know it's painful.
01:13:18.292,01:13:19.750,But we can't be weak.
01:13:19.833,01:13:20.708,That's right.
01:13:21.667,01:13:24.500,This is why we need to stay focused.
01:13:24.583,01:13:26.417,This is why we need to stick to the mission.
01:13:26.500,01:13:30.167,The little girl trusted us with Okja. We have to respect her bravery.
01:13:30.250,01:13:31.958,She never agreed to send Okja.
01:13:38.833,01:13:40.250,She was in our truck.
01:13:48.542,01:13:49.583,I lied.
01:13:56.042,01:13:58.917,"I don't know. In that moment, it's just... I couldn't..."
01:14:00.542,01:14:02.125,I couldn't stop the mission.
01:14:02.917,01:14:06.042,"You know, this is... this is the coolest mission ever."
01:14:06.125,01:14:08.333,"-I have all this stuff and-- -Hey, K... K."
01:14:10.500,01:14:11.875,It's okay.
01:14:15.833,01:14:23.708,"I hold you dear to my heart, but you have dishonored the 40-year history and meaningful legacy of the Animal Liberation Front."
01:14:23.792,01:14:28.417,You have betrayed the great minds and brave fighters that have preceded you.
01:14:29.792,01:14:31.125,Never mistranslate.
01:14:33.750,01:14:35.458,Translation is sacred.
01:14:38.542,01:14:39.750,From this moment on...
01:14:41.167,01:14:45.042,you are no longer a member of the ALF. You are permanently banned.
01:14:47.042,01:14:48.042,Get out.
01:14:49.458,01:14:50.583,However...
01:14:52.000,01:14:54.917,since it is vital that we continue with our mission...
01:14:55.625,01:14:58.458,we will return your equipment to you after its completion.
01:14:58.542,01:15:02.000,Consider this your final contribution to the ALF.
01:15:19.333,01:15:20.417,You want some?
01:15:28.458,01:15:30.375,It'll make you feel better.
01:15:48.083,01:15:52.250,This is an unspeakable place.
01:15:55.417,01:15:57.917,I know. I know.
01:16:02.958,01:16:04.917,There are worse rooms out there.
01:16:07.333,01:16:10.917,Lucy Mirando says I'm not supposed to harm you in here.
01:16:11.000,01:16:13.125,"Well, at least not visibly."
01:16:13.208,01:16:17.292,She wants you perfect for her big telecast!
01:16:18.667,01:16:19.667,But...
01:16:22.875,01:16:33.708,"when a woman humiliates a man in front of his own colleagues, a man is inclined to make his own decisions."
01:16:39.250,01:16:41.875,"This is nothing, really."
01:16:41.958,01:16:45.208,"It's used on beef. I mean, live cows."
01:16:45.875,01:16:47.417,To check their marbling.
01:16:54.000,01:16:56.208,"Hi, Dr. Johnny. Is Okja with you?"
01:16:56.292,01:16:57.208,Yes!
01:16:57.292,01:17:00.708,Our precious farmer princess insists that she speaks to her on the phone.
01:17:00.791,01:17:01.666,What?
01:17:02.292,01:17:05.042,Whatever. She says you should lift her ear and put the receiver underneath.
01:17:05.625,01:17:08.041,-You're on speakerphone! -Okja!
01:17:08.125,01:17:09.292,Okja!
01:17:13.333,01:17:15.542,Okja! Okja! What did you say?
01:17:16.958,01:17:19.500,Okja! Okja!
01:17:43.833,01:17:45.541,Bang! Sirloin.
01:17:49.541,01:17:50.500,Ooh!
01:17:51.083,01:17:52.125,The shank.
01:17:53.791,01:17:57.000,Don't worry. You won't die.
01:17:58.167,01:18:00.458,We're just gonna take some of your meat.
01:18:01.792,01:18:05.708,"And of course, I'm not gonna eat any."
01:18:06.958,01:18:08.833,We have tasters for that.
01:18:09.625,01:18:13.292,"They're a bunch of half-wit, degenerate fucktards!"
01:18:17.958,01:18:22.125,I'm gonna... I'm gonna poke you in five places.
01:18:22.708,01:18:26.166,And I'm sorry. It's gonna hurt.
01:18:27.792,01:18:29.458,I shouldn't be here.
01:18:38.250,01:18:40.625,Everybody knows that about me!
01:18:55.583,01:18:56.583,Tasty.
01:18:58.708,01:18:59.958,"Fuck, yeah."
01:19:00.042,01:19:04.542,That was the best I've ever had. The best of the best.
01:19:16.417,01:19:19.292,Juicy like you've never tasted before.
01:19:19.917,01:19:23.500,An exquisite taste with a very affordable price!
01:19:23.583,01:19:29.000,"Made fresh from our naturally-grown, Grade A super pigs."
01:19:29.083,01:19:32.000,Very healthy! Come and try!
01:19:32.083,01:19:33.250,"Pink streamers, pink fireworks."
01:19:33.333,01:19:34.917,Lucy's gonna be happy. I'm gonna get my bonus.
01:19:35.000,01:19:36.708,I'm gonna be-- What the hell is this?
01:19:36.791,01:19:39.625,That's Lucy's autograph. Designed by Lucy Mirando.
01:19:39.708,01:19:42.125,"Oh! She can't get enough of herself, can she?"
01:19:42.875,01:19:45.333,"Hey! Oh, how's everyone doing?"
01:19:45.417,01:19:47.917,Still with this thing. It looks super tacky.
01:19:55.000,01:19:56.542,So we should be careful what we say.
01:19:56.625,01:19:59.042,"Yes, yes, everything is fine."
01:19:59.125,01:20:01.000,But you have to wear this.
01:20:01.083,01:20:05.500,"Oh, it's a special edition, custom-made, just for you."
01:20:05.583,01:20:08.625,Look. The CEO even autographed it.
01:20:08.708,01:20:10.083,"Boop! Totally rad, right?"
01:20:11.750,01:20:12.958,"Now, let's put it on."
01:20:15.958,01:20:19.416,Mija... Oh! Think about how dramatic it will be.
01:20:19.500,01:20:22.417,Okja... Okja doesn't even know you're here.
01:20:22.500,01:20:28.042,"If you show up on stage without telling her, it'll be such a great surprise."
01:20:28.625,01:20:30.083,You know? Surprise?
01:20:37.125,01:20:40.625,"Mija. Mija, I don't think you understand this situation."
01:20:42.542,01:20:45.417,"No, no, no. We are the ones who have Okja. Okay?"
01:20:45.500,01:20:47.792,We are doing you a favor. Do you get it now?
01:20:49.375,01:20:52.375,"Yep, yep, yep. You want to go back home with Okja, right?"
01:20:52.958,01:20:54.625,Then do as you're told.
01:20:54.708,01:20:58.375,"Otherwise, this is what will happen to Okja."
01:21:00.875,01:21:01.875,Put it on.
01:21:03.667,01:21:05.500,"The turnout's looking good, don't you think?"
01:21:08.375,01:21:09.583,All eyes on her.
01:21:23.708,01:21:24.708,Jay.
01:23:39.542,01:23:42.042,"Oh, man, this is so good, man. You gotta try this."
01:23:42.125,01:23:43.458,It's actually really good.
01:23:49.375,01:23:51.625,"Good day, all. Thank you very much."
01:23:52.958,01:23:54.875,These are for you.
01:23:54.958,01:23:56.583,"Oh! Thanks, Frank."
01:23:58.292,01:24:01.000,Ten years. An extraordinary accomplishment.
01:24:06.083,01:24:08.792,You have to try one of these. They're completely delicious.
01:24:17.000,01:24:18.000,Delicious.
01:24:20.667,01:24:21.667,Beautiful.
01:24:21.750,01:24:23.583,-Mmm! -Mmm.
01:24:23.667,01:24:24.917,Mmm.
01:24:26.000,01:24:27.250,Mmm.
01:24:34.208,01:24:37.625,Such a shame we had to tell all those little white lies.
01:24:40.250,01:24:45.375,It's not our fault that the consumers are so paranoid about GM foods.
01:24:52.167,01:24:53.917,These are really beautiful.
01:24:55.625,01:24:58.417,Your taste is as impeccable as always.
01:25:00.292,01:25:02.500,"Well, the flowers aren't actually from me."
01:25:02.583,01:25:03.458,Oh?
01:25:04.833,01:25:07.375,-Are they from Nancy? -Yes.
01:25:08.000,01:25:09.708,Nancy's here. Not in London.
01:25:10.833,01:25:12.333,She's here? In New York?
01:25:13.625,01:25:14.708,Fuck Nancy.
01:25:15.417,01:25:17.875,-She's been here a while. -I told you to keep her away!
01:25:17.958,01:25:19.583,She frightens people!
01:25:20.167,01:25:21.708,"You frighten people, too, Lucy."
01:25:24.042,01:25:27.375,"Yeah, but she really frightens people. She reminds them of Daddy."
01:25:36.125,01:25:38.833,This is mine. This is my project.
01:25:39.500,01:25:42.000,She just wants to support you on your special day.
01:25:43.625,01:25:44.792,Is she watching me?
01:25:50.791,01:25:52.958,Johnny's in the house! Johnny's in the house!
01:25:53.542,01:25:55.333,"Whoo, whoo, whoo!"
01:26:02.208,01:26:03.375,Yeah!
01:26:04.125,01:26:05.875,"Whoo, whoo, whoo!"
01:26:11.583,01:26:14.667,Dr. Johnny's...
01:26:18.417,01:26:22.542,Everybody knows Dr. Johnny can't stand anything boring!
01:26:40.292,01:26:49.042,"Ten years ago, 26 farmers from lands far away were each given a magical super piglet."
01:26:49.958,01:26:59.167,"This year, I met these wonderful people, to decide which super piglet would have the honor of being invited to this prestigious occasion."
01:27:01.500,01:27:04.250,Are you ready to meet the winner of this contest?
01:27:06.458,01:27:10.000,The best super pig on the face of the Earth?
01:27:17.333,01:27:20.000,"Well, I'm afraid you're gonna have to meet somebody else first."
01:27:21.958,01:27:23.750,"Before you meet the talent, you gotta meet the suits."
01:27:24.958,01:27:26.833,I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.
01:27:28.958,01:27:31.417,She is an amazing little lady...
01:27:32.250,01:27:37.375,and she happens to be the brain behind this entire super pig project!
01:27:38.500,01:27:48.250,"Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for the one, the only, Lucy Mirando!"
01:28:04.791,01:28:05.666,Fucking idiot.
01:28:06.333,01:28:08.208,You look amazing!
01:28:11.833,01:28:12.958,"Oh, Johnny."
01:28:13.042,01:28:17.083,You're skating on thin ice. Watch out you don't fall in and drown.
01:28:17.167,01:28:22.500,Don't worry. I'm not here to put you to sleep with some corporate speech like my boring sister might have.
01:28:30.417,01:28:35.583,No. I'm here to introduce you to a real superstar.
01:28:36.292,01:28:43.583,"Maybe you've already seen her on YouTube, enjoying her little shopping spree in that underground mall in Seoul!"
01:28:43.667,01:28:47.708,So let's all welcome an extraordinary little girl.
01:28:47.792,01:28:54.625,A local farmer who raised her beloved super pig in wild and beautiful nature.
01:28:55.208,01:28:59.208,The fearless pig rider from across the globe!
01:28:59.292,01:29:00.500,Please welcome...
01:29:01.458,01:29:02.458,Mija!
01:29:12.958,01:29:17.333,And here she is! Our ultimate super pig!
01:29:17.417,01:29:18.875,Okja!
01:30:38.417,01:30:40.083,Come on. Now!
01:30:40.167,01:30:42.292,Good. Here's Johnny!
01:30:51.583,01:30:52.875,Don't look back.
01:30:57.458,01:30:58.667,Just look at me.
01:31:07.833,01:31:08.708,Stop it!
01:31:13.458,01:31:14.292,Go!
01:31:27.500,01:31:47.000,"I promise... No, I pledge, to learn everything I can, everything from this situation-- of Mirando's crimes against humanity and animals, go to YouTube and search Mirando is fucked."
01:31:47.083,01:31:55.250,"That's right, folks. Go to YouTube now and search Mirando is F-U-C-K-E-D."
01:31:55.958,01:31:56.958,Fucked!
01:32:09.000,01:32:10.667,"I don't think we have a choice, Nancy."
01:32:11.958,01:32:13.208,You have to go out there.
01:32:19.333,01:32:21.083,What a clusterfuck.
01:32:22.167,01:32:24.375,Let's get private security in there.
01:32:25.916,01:32:26.791,Black Chalk.
01:32:26.875,01:32:29.125,"We're on good terms with the NYPD, correct?"
01:32:30.583,01:32:32.000,We have an arrangement.
01:32:53.167,01:32:54.625,Black Chalk!
01:33:57.083,01:33:58.167,"Come here, come here."
01:33:59.625,01:34:01.458,"Red, let's go."
01:34:01.542,01:34:02.542,Move!
01:34:27.166,01:34:29.000,Move! Move!
01:34:30.291,01:34:31.125,Go!
01:35:59.083,01:36:03.625,"Well, good luck with clearing up my mess, twinny."
01:36:06.291,01:36:09.833,"Well, for a while back then, you forgot you were such a loser."
01:36:24.041,01:36:26.958,"I mean, Daddy was a terrible man."
01:36:28.292,01:36:29.625,He was a real horror.
01:36:31.875,01:36:35.042,"But, by God, did he know about business."
01:36:41.333,01:36:43.917,"Don't worry about your apology speech, twinny."
01:36:44.000,01:36:46.250,I'll pretend to be you in front of the press.
01:36:49.458,01:36:54.333,You'll understand that I will be instructing our corporate attorneys not to assist you in any way.
01:36:54.417,01:36:55.417,Frank.
01:36:58.292,01:37:01.875,-Zero delay on the distribution plan. -Of course.
01:37:01.958,01:37:05.000,Scrap Lucy's precious promotional marketing crap.
01:37:05.083,01:37:08.875,-Tell everyone ASAP. -Definitely.
01:37:08.958,01:37:11.417,"We already have FDA approval, correct?"
01:37:11.500,01:37:15.333,"Yes, we do. But I'm not sure how the customers will react after today."
01:37:15.417,01:37:17.042,"If it's cheap, they'll eat it."
01:37:17.125,01:37:19.792,I guarantee early sales will be strong.
01:37:20.375,01:37:22.792,Shut down the lab as already discussed.
01:37:22.875,01:37:25.417,We'll visit the production facility later tonight.
01:37:25.500,01:37:27.583,"Get all the execs there, even the ones on vacation."
01:37:27.667,01:37:29.125,Put all the pigs into production.
01:37:47.208,01:37:48.458,What are you doing?
01:37:55.333,01:37:56.375,Okja...
01:37:57.458,01:37:58.667,We need to hurry.
01:38:04.417,01:38:08.708,"Look, I'm just saying that if I call you one time, I like for you to pick up the first time, know what I mean?"
01:38:08.792,01:38:11.958,"Like, I have a friend here who's incredibly sick."
01:38:13.917,01:38:16.375,Are you even certified? Do you know what you're doing?
01:38:17.542,01:38:19.917,The guy's bleeding out! Do you know what you're doing?
01:38:38.125,01:38:40.917,"Mija, are you okay?"
01:38:48.708,01:38:50.250,She wants to know where we're going.
01:38:54.875,01:38:55.958,We're going to Okja.
01:38:59.708,01:39:03.708,"Yes, but you should know the situation is not good."
01:39:07.333,01:39:09.833,I didn't... There is no other way.
01:39:16.417,01:39:18.375,Just tell me where she is!
01:39:25.500,01:39:27.958,We are going to need your help. Mija...
01:39:48.625,01:39:49.792,Wait! Mija!
01:39:54.708,01:39:56.417,Okja!
01:40:11.583,01:40:14.792,"Emergency, emergency. We have intruders in section A-24!"
01:40:21.333,01:40:24.750,"All right, you're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine. Okay?"
01:40:25.292,01:40:28.833,"Six minutes, 45 seconds before Black Chalk arrive!"
01:40:30.208,01:40:31.833,This is our last chance.
01:40:49.625,01:40:50.917,Okja!
01:43:02.000,01:43:03.042,Okja.
01:43:05.833,01:43:06.833,Okja!
01:43:07.500,01:43:08.583,No!
01:43:26.083,01:43:31.208,"I'm flummoxed that security is so lax as to allow a bunch of hooligans to delay the production line, even for a second."
01:43:31.292,01:43:34.750,It won't happen again. Please note that Black Chalk was here exactly on time.
01:43:40.750,01:43:41.917,No! No violence!
01:43:42.000,01:43:45.500,Isn't this Lucy's beloved fearless pig rider?
01:43:45.583,01:43:49.875,She is. And that's our best super pig.
01:43:49.958,01:43:51.292,"Well, what's the hiccup?"
01:43:52.208,01:43:53.708,Why is it still alive?
01:43:56.792,01:43:58.958,"Well, we can only sell the dead ones."
01:44:00.625,01:44:03.917,I wanna go home with Okja.
01:44:04.000,01:44:06.583,"No, it's my property."
01:44:06.667,01:44:10.042,-You're a fucking psychopath. -You should be ashamed of yourself.
01:44:10.125,01:44:13.208,Fuck off! We're extremely proud of our achievements.
01:44:13.292,01:44:15.167,We're very hardworking businesspeople.
01:44:15.250,01:44:18.208,"We do deals, and these are the deals we do."
01:44:18.958,01:44:22.083,This is the tenderloin for the sophisticated restaurants.
01:44:22.167,01:44:25.375,The Mexicans love the feet. I know. Go figure!
01:44:25.458,01:44:30.792,"We all love the face and the anus, as American as apple pie! Hot dogs."
01:44:30.875,01:44:34.458,"It's all edible. All edible, except the squeal."
01:44:36.250,01:44:39.958,-So you're the other Mirando. -And you are?
01:44:44.791,01:44:46.625,You already have a shitload of money.
01:44:47.208,01:44:49.625,-Please. -This is business.
01:44:49.708,01:44:56.250,"Hey, Nancy! I hold all creatures dear to my heart, but you are crying out to be an exception."
01:44:57.083,01:44:58.041,Mija!
01:44:58.625,01:45:00.125,"Oh, okay."
01:45:03.125,01:45:04.416,Terminálo.
01:46:00.041,01:46:01.250,Very nice.
01:46:02.792,01:46:04.167,We have a deal.
01:46:04.250,01:46:06.083,This thing is worth a lot of money.
01:46:06.167,01:46:09.000,Make sure our customer and her purchase get home safely.
01:46:09.083,01:46:12.917,Our first ever Mirando super pig sale. Pleasure doing business with you.
01:49:49.625,01:49:50.625,Yes.
01:49:55.500,01:49:57.083,Don't scare the chickens.
01:59:28.625,01:59:31.333,Lot of folks flying in from Midwest and Canada.
01:59:31.417,01:59:32.417,Good.
01:59:33.458,01:59:35.167,"Oh, let me introduce you to a new member."
01:59:43.875,01:59:46.000,"Red. Oh, it's because of your hair?"
01:59:52.250,01:59:54.167,I'm assuming Mirando bigwigs will be there?
01:59:57.125,01:59:59.250,Including Nancy Mirando.
02:00:08.750,02:00:09.750,There it is.
