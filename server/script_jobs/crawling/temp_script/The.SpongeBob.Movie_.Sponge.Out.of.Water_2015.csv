00:01:11.238,00:01:12.364,A-ha!
00:01:42.436,00:01:43.478,Eh?
00:01:59.036,00:02:00.579,Ah...
00:02:08.837,00:02:12.591,"Oh, there you are, my lovely."
00:02:24.603,00:02:26.271,Hmm! What's that?
00:02:26.938,00:02:28.065,Take the book?
00:02:28.398,00:02:29.608,I don't mind if I do.
00:02:36.156,00:02:38.367,"Finally, you are mine."
00:02:45.707,00:02:48.460,All right. Let's do this. Bare knuckles.
00:02:48.669,00:02:50.712,"Bring it on, skinny. You don't scare me."
00:02:57.886,00:02:59.638,You got any sevens?
00:02:59.721,00:03:01.181,Go fish.
00:03:05.185,00:03:06.269,Is that all you got?
00:03:11.775,00:03:12.776,Ooh.
00:03:34.005,00:03:35.298,Hmm.
00:03:35.632,00:03:37.718,"Man, this is way overdue."
00:03:40.762,00:03:46.893,"Once upon a time, under the sea, there was a little town called Bikini Bottom."
00:03:46.977,00:03:54.693,"In this town, there was a place called The Krusty Krab, where folks would come to eat a thing called the Krabby Patty."
00:03:54.776,00:04:02.159,"Every greasy spoon has a fry cook, and the one who worked here was named SpongeBob SquarePants."
00:04:23.805,00:04:25.056,Huh?
00:04:25.182,00:04:28.351,"There's only one thing worse than talking birds, and that would be..."
00:04:28.643,00:04:29.811,Singing birds!
00:04:35.358,00:04:36.485,Take it from us.
00:04:36.568,00:04:38.945,He really does hate singing birds.
00:04:40.238,00:04:42.616,"Just keep weading. Pwease, Mr. Piwate, sir."
00:04:43.825,00:04:45.994,Come closer while I tell you the tale.
00:04:46.578,00:04:48.705,"Okay, start reading. No. Not that close!"
00:04:49.080,00:04:51.124,Yeah. Hmm.
00:04:51.792,00:04:53.043,"All right, here we go."
00:04:55.420,00:04:59.090,"Now, SpongeBob loved his job as a fry cook..."
00:05:00.342,00:05:02.010,...more than anything.
00:05:02.093,00:05:07.057,And that is saying a lot because he loved everything!
00:05:09.559,00:05:11.311,"He loved his best friend, Patrick."
00:05:13.396,00:05:18.610,He loved blowing bubbles -and jellyfishing. -Whee!
00:05:18.777,00:05:25.492,He loved making Krabby Patties for the folks of Bikini Bottom just as much as they loved eating them.
00:05:25.575,00:05:30.121,"Why, you may ask, do they love this greasy little sandwich so much?"
00:05:30.205,00:05:32.374,Why did they eat them for breakfast...
00:05:34.835,00:05:38.672,"and dinner, despite their doctor's warnings?"
00:05:38.755,00:05:40.340,He'll be gone in a week.
00:05:47.347,00:05:51.726,No one was sure what was in these patties that made them so delicious.
00:05:52.018,00:05:55.522,"And, frankly, no one cared, -except for Plankton. -Meh."
00:05:55.605,00:06:02.529,"Plankton owned a restaurant right across the street from The Krusty Krab, where no one ate because the food was really bad."
00:06:02.612,00:06:04.322,"Now, is that really necessary?"
00:06:08.243,00:06:09.244,to steal the recipe.
00:06:10.453,00:06:12.706,"SpongeBob, please, let's talk about this!"
00:06:12.789,00:06:16.251,And SpongeBob was always there to protect it.
00:06:16.793,00:06:22.090,"But today, things would be different."
00:06:24.134,00:06:25.760,"Good morning, SpongeBob!"
00:06:25.844,00:06:26.803,"Morning, Patrick!"
00:06:26.887,00:06:28.847,You here for your pre-lunch Krabby Patty?
00:06:28.930,00:06:30.473,I'm getting two today.
00:06:30.682,00:06:33.727,One for me and one for my friend.
00:06:33.810,00:06:35.687,Oh. Have I met this friend?
00:06:35.770,00:06:37.689,"You know me, SpongeBob."
00:06:40.817,00:06:42.360,"Enjoy, Patrick's tummy."
00:06:52.662,00:06:55.999,"Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen..."
00:06:56.082,00:06:59.419,"Hey, Mr. Krabs, I thought we got our tartar sauce delivery on Thursday."
00:06:59.502,00:07:00.754,Tartar...
00:07:01.880,00:07:02.923,Sauce?
00:07:07.969,00:07:09.054,Plankton!
00:07:09.220,00:07:11.723,"So it's a food fight he wants, eh?"
00:07:11.973,00:07:13.516,Welcome to Air Plankton.
00:07:13.600,00:07:18.605,Please put your seat backs and tray tables up as we're now approaching our final destination.
00:07:22.317,00:07:24.736,"Okay, Patrick, load the potatoes!"
00:07:25.362,00:07:26.613,"Mashed or scalloped, sir?"
00:07:26.696,00:07:28.531,"No, Patrick. Raw."
00:07:28.782,00:07:29.783,"Sir, yes, sir!"
00:07:30.951,00:07:32.744,Locked and loaded!
00:07:33.787,00:07:38.208,"Don't worry, little formuler, you'll be safe in this, uh, safe."
00:07:39.960,00:07:41.044,Fire!
00:07:44.923,00:07:46.049,Potatoes?
00:07:48.468,00:07:49.719,He's closing in!
00:07:49.803,00:07:52.806,I think we have a few minutes before he gets here.
00:08:00.105,00:08:02.899,"Hey, it's raining fries!"
00:08:03.066,00:08:06.152,It's gonna take a lot more than potatoes to bring this baby down.
00:08:09.197,00:08:10.323,Or maybe not.
00:08:15.412,00:08:16.371,Whoo!
00:08:16.454,00:08:19.666,"Wait a minute, Patrick, look! He's got a tank!"
00:08:24.796,00:08:28.174,"Well, Krabs, you're certainly in a pickle now!"
00:08:39.227,00:08:41.438,"Hey, it's raining pickles!"
00:08:45.900,00:08:47.152,Tanks.
00:08:47.402,00:08:48.445,You're welcome!
00:08:52.198,00:08:53.116,Finland.
00:08:58.496,00:08:59.414,"Your orders, sir!"
00:08:59.539,00:09:04.419,"I'll have two Krabby Patties... extra ketchup, extra mustard, and hold the mayo."
00:09:04.586,00:09:05.962,Wrong channel!
00:09:06.171,00:09:07.172,"Your orders, sir!"
00:09:07.297,00:09:10.967,Extra ketchup! Extra mustard! Hold the mayo!
00:09:11.134,00:09:12.218,"Yes, sir!"
00:09:12.427,00:09:15.096,Extra ketchup! Extra mustard!
00:09:19.309,00:09:20.894,Unleash the condiments!
00:09:21.061,00:09:22.645,With relish.
00:09:31.738,00:09:33.490,Excuse me.
00:09:41.206,00:09:42.165,Hello?
00:09:42.791,00:09:43.666,Hello?
00:09:43.750,00:09:45.085,Guess y'all don't want my money.
00:09:45.168,00:09:46.044,Money?
00:09:46.419,00:09:47.754,Thank you! Come again!
00:09:53.927,00:09:57.263,I can't hold the mayo any longer!
00:10:02.310,00:10:03.436,Mayo?
00:10:03.520,00:10:06.231,"Well, it's going to take a lot more than mayo to stop..."
00:10:11.486,00:10:12.487,Now what?
00:10:22.247,00:10:23.373,Oh!
00:10:23.665,00:10:26.084,"I just remembered, I don't work for Mr. Krabs!"
00:10:29.087,00:10:31.381,Robot! Giant robot!
00:10:31.548,00:10:33.550,Robot! Robot!
00:10:33.633,00:10:37.053,"Mr. Krabs, Plankton's here and he's got a giant robot!"
00:10:37.137,00:10:38.555,"Quick, boy, bar the door!"
00:10:39.097,00:10:40.140,Got it!
00:10:49.858,00:10:52.318,I'll take one secret formula...
00:11:05.623,00:11:08.293,"Oh, barnacles. I'm out of gas?"
00:11:11.337,00:11:12.881,I'm not through yet.
00:11:13.173,00:11:16.843,I've got something that will make you hand over that formula.
00:11:17.093,00:11:19.345,Something you can't resist.
00:11:22.515,00:11:24.142,Yes! Huh?
00:11:24.225,00:11:27.187,That's... That's... That's impossible!
00:11:28.271,00:11:30.857,"Well, it was full of money just last week."
00:11:30.940,00:11:33.985,And then I bought that airplane and built that tank.
00:11:35.403,00:11:39.199,someone's just a wee bit broke!
00:11:40.325,00:11:43.036,"Well, Krabs, I guess you've won."
00:11:43.119,00:11:46.915,I've spent every penny I've ever made trying to put you out of business.
00:11:51.794,00:11:54.714,"Besides, what can I do with one measly cent anyway?"
00:11:54.923,00:11:56.883,You could give it to me. Just a suggestion.
00:11:57.050,00:11:58.635,"Here, take it."
00:12:02.889,00:12:05.558,You've taken everything else. Why not?
00:12:07.852,00:12:13.733,"Well, Plankton, like a reheated Krabby Patty, you've been foiled again."
00:12:15.443,00:12:19.530,"I guess this means the secret formula is safe forever, right, Mr. Krabs?"
00:12:19.614,00:12:21.115,"It sure does, boy."
00:12:21.824,00:12:23.743,Why don't you scurry along?
00:12:25.870,00:12:28.498,Thanks for coming! Have a nice day!
00:12:34.837,00:12:36.089,Pathetic.
00:12:36.172,00:12:38.967,I'm just going to go out there and gloat a little.
00:12:51.145,00:12:53.856,"Cyclops to Laptop. Come in, Laptop."
00:12:54.023,00:12:57.277,Laptop. You do realize that nickname is demeaning?
00:12:57.360,00:13:00.280,I have twice the processing power of a laptop.
00:13:09.038,00:13:09.914,Huh?
00:13:12.000,00:13:14.294,"A pressure plate, eh, Krabs?"
00:13:14.919,00:13:16.254,Amateur hour.
00:13:18.339,00:13:19.966,Hmm.
00:13:20.883,00:13:21.843,Perfect!
00:13:26.139,00:13:27.473,Not a bad likeness.
00:13:27.849,00:13:30.310,Good enough to fool that idiot Krabs.
00:13:30.393,00:13:32.437,"Easy, easy."
00:13:39.360,00:13:41.237,I've never seen him gloat this hard before.
00:13:42.905,00:13:47.327,"Hey, well, Plankton, me bunions are telling me it's time to stop gloating."
00:13:48.328,00:13:51.748,Huh? Looks like you're falling apart at the seams.
00:13:54.042,00:13:56.294,-Huh? -Poor me.
00:13:56.377,00:13:59.047,"-Sob, sob. -A robot?"
00:14:02.342,00:14:03.343,Uh-oh.
00:14:09.640,00:14:11.059,Me formuler!
00:14:14.729,00:14:16.397,Huh? Ow!
00:14:20.109,00:14:22.320,"No, no, no! No!"
00:14:22.403,00:14:23.946,Squidward! Open up!
00:14:24.155,00:14:26.991,"Ha-ha, victory dance. Boo-ya."
00:14:28.659,00:14:31.579,"Come on, SpongeBob, join me!"
00:14:31.662,00:14:35.541,"And we'll be rich and powerful, until I eventually betray you."
00:14:36.793,00:14:39.045,"-Uh, join me! -No! Never!"
00:14:39.128,00:14:41.172,I'm on Team Krabs for life!
00:14:44.133,00:14:47.470,Plankton!
00:14:56.854,00:14:58.815,What? Where'd it go?
00:15:01.401,00:15:04.529,I proved that to be a scientific impossibility seven times!
00:15:06.572,00:15:09.075,I think I forgot to empty Gary's litter box today.
00:15:11.619,00:15:14.247,"Where's me formuler, Plankton?"
00:15:14.455,00:15:16.999,I... I don't know! It just disappeared!
00:15:17.166,00:15:19.168,"Why should I believe you, you lying liar?"
00:15:19.335,00:15:23.589,"Normally, I'd agree with you, Mr. Krabs, but this time he's telling the truth. It just vanished!"
00:15:28.845,00:15:31.597,"Mr. Krabs, I'm telling you he's innocent!"
00:15:31.681,00:15:33.224,"What are you going to do, Krabs?"
00:15:33.474,00:15:34.642,Pour hot oil on me?
00:15:34.725,00:15:36.853,Or put bamboo shoots under my nails?
00:15:37.061,00:15:39.814,"No. Knock, knock."
00:15:40.773,00:15:44.444,"Knock-knock jokes? I can do this all day, Krabs."
00:15:44.610,00:15:45.778,"Knock, knock."
00:15:46.028,00:15:48.072,"Oh, boy. Who's there?"
00:15:48.489,00:15:49.449,Jimmy.
00:15:49.574,00:15:50.616,Jimmy who?
00:15:50.825,00:15:53.870,"Jimmy back my formuler, Plankton!"
00:15:55.329,00:15:57.874,"Well, that's stupid, but how is it torture?"
00:16:01.043,00:16:04.297,Jimmy back my formula?
00:16:04.630,00:16:05.756,Hmm.
00:16:06.382,00:16:08.468,Oh!
00:16:08.551,00:16:10.094,I get it!
00:16:18.686,00:16:21.564,"Oh, make it stop, Krabs! Make it stop!"
00:16:31.657,00:16:34.118,"Mr. Krabs? SpongeBob, zip it!"
00:16:38.080,00:16:39.999,The customers are getting restless!
00:16:40.082,00:16:43.794,They're asking for refunds.
00:16:51.093,00:16:55.556,"Listen up, boy. Get in there and make me customers some Krabby Patties!"
00:16:55.765,00:16:57.767,"All right, Plankton... Huh?"
00:17:02.021,00:17:04.065,"SpongeBob! What's wrong, boy?"
00:17:07.401,00:17:09.612,We're out of Krabby Patties?
00:17:09.779,00:17:13.866,How can we make more Krabby Patties without the secret formula?
00:17:13.950,00:17:16.369,You've got to have that formuler memorized by now!
00:17:16.452,00:17:26.212,"But as you are aware, sir, the employee handbook clearly states, and I quote, No employee may, in part or in whole, commit the Krabby Patty secret formula to any recorded written or visual form, including memories, dreams, and/or needlepoint."
00:17:32.635,00:17:34.136,Stop!
00:17:36.097,00:17:37.848,I'm not your enemy!
00:17:37.932,00:17:39.892,Plankton is your enemy!
00:17:39.976,00:17:42.144,So is he an anemone or a plankton?
00:17:43.563,00:17:45.940,"Well, someone had to do it."
00:17:49.652,00:17:52.655,-Krabby Patty... -I can almost taste it.
00:17:52.738,00:17:55.408,"Mr. Krabs, Plankton didn't take the secret formula."
00:17:55.575,00:17:57.076,"Not now, SpongeBob!"
00:17:57.368,00:18:00.454,Hey! I ordered a double Krabby Patty!
00:18:00.538,00:18:07.962,"So join me! Help get the formuler back, and I'll give each and every one of you a free Krabby Patty!"
00:18:09.797,00:18:11.173,"Oh, no! Wait!"
00:18:11.382,00:18:13.968,"Even better, a slight discount!"
00:18:19.599,00:18:21.309,But he didn't do it.
00:18:24.979,00:18:26.314,and then... Poof!
00:18:26.689,00:18:29.442,And now it's gone. Gone forever.
00:18:29.525,00:18:32.695,"Oh, I was so close to gaining the people's respect-slash-fear."
00:18:32.862,00:18:34.113,"Um, Plankton?"
00:18:34.238,00:18:37.992,"Oh, when will my frustration-slash-humiliation end?"
00:18:38.159,00:18:40.119,"-Plankton? -Not now, hon!"
00:18:40.202,00:18:41.912,I'm ranting-slash-raving.
00:18:42.872,00:18:44.373,"All right, what is it?"
00:18:44.498,00:18:48.085,"Well, I was trying to tell you there's an angry mob outside."
00:18:55.343,00:18:57.637,We'd like to have a word with you!
00:19:02.224,00:19:03.934,Can I get anybody a Chum Burger?
00:19:06.020,00:19:08.814,This is the last time I'm going to ask you.
00:19:09.106,00:19:10.900,Where is me formuler?
00:19:11.108,00:19:14.695,"I told you, Krabs, I don't have it."
00:19:14.820,00:19:16.447,Wrong answer.
00:19:18.908,00:19:20.951,"All right, Mr. Krabs, let me get in on this."
00:19:23.954,00:19:25.915,What's going on around here?
00:19:26.207,00:19:28.292,"You may want to step back a little, Mr. Krabs."
00:19:28.376,00:19:29.418,This could get messy.
00:19:29.752,00:19:30.670,Let's hope so.
00:19:31.253,00:19:33.422,"So you won't talk, eh, Plankton?"
00:19:33.714,00:19:35.675,I didn't want to have to do this.
00:19:35.925,00:19:38.594,"Plankton, here comes the pain."
00:19:38.969,00:19:42.098,"Soap in the eye, eh? Diabolical!"
00:19:43.432,00:19:46.143,No! Stop! Don't!
00:19:46.227,00:19:48.145,Wait. That didn't look painful.
00:19:48.354,00:19:56.320,"Mr. Krabs, you may not understand what I'm about to do today, but someday we'll look back and have a good laugh."
00:19:56.821,00:19:58.030,Wait a minute.
00:19:58.114,00:19:59.990,"Hey, they're getting away!"
00:20:00.449,00:20:01.992,"Sorry, Mr. Krabs!"
00:20:02.284,00:20:06.539,"So, you've been running a long con on me, eh?"
00:20:06.914,00:20:09.875,All these years you've been working for Plankton!
00:20:10.042,00:20:11.419,They're in cahoots!
00:20:11.502,00:20:13.629,"Yeah, I guess that's a short way of saying it."
00:20:13.754,00:20:15.297,Stop that bubble!
00:20:26.308,00:20:28.728,Please tell me there's something soft below me.
00:20:33.941,00:20:37.903,Oh. You were like an underpaid son to me.
00:20:38.237,00:20:41.157,I would've expected Squidward to stab me in the back.
00:20:42.408,00:20:43.534,But SpongeBob?
00:20:43.784,00:20:47.621,Me most trusted employee? Working with me sworn enemy?
00:20:47.705,00:20:50.541,"You know what this means, Mr. Squidward."
00:20:50.708,00:20:52.126,We get the rest of the day off?
00:20:52.209,00:20:53.082,No!
00:20:53.157,00:20:56.672,This be but a harbinger of what I fear lies ahead.
00:20:56.922,00:20:58.424,For you. For me.
00:20:58.591,00:21:00.217,For all of Bikini Bottom!
00:21:00.426,00:21:02.887,The Krabby Patty is what ties us all together!
00:21:02.970,00:21:07.683,"Without it, there will be a complete breakdown of social order."
00:21:07.892,00:21:10.352,A war of all against all!
00:21:10.603,00:21:13.522,Dark times are ahead.
00:21:13.939,00:21:16.358,Dark times indeed!
00:21:17.943,00:21:18.903,Seriously?
00:21:19.820,00:21:21.906,Aren't you overreacting a bit?
00:21:24.033,00:21:26.577,"Welcome to the apocalypse, Mr. Squidward."
00:21:39.340,00:21:43.093,an apocalyptic cesspool forevermore.
00:21:43.552,00:21:44.929,The end.
00:21:47.473,00:21:50.392,Wait a minute. That's a terrible ending.
00:21:50.476,00:21:52.686,"-Oh, this is bad. Really bad. -What? What?"
00:21:52.770,00:21:54.939,SpongeBob's in trouble and the story's over?
00:22:02.404,00:22:05.366,There is no way that that's the end of this story.
00:22:06.867,00:22:08.410,Of course it is. I'll show you.
00:22:08.494,00:22:09.537,Just turn around.
00:22:09.620,00:22:11.080,"Oh, all right."
00:22:13.249,00:22:15.167,"I need that to fly, you jerk."
00:22:16.836,00:22:20.923,The End!
00:22:25.970,00:22:28.013,-Unhand that book! -You let go of that!
00:22:28.097,00:22:29.598,"Let go, you numbskull!"
00:22:31.725,00:22:36.188,"You better keep reading, Mr. Pirate, or else!"
00:22:37.565,00:22:41.277,"I know I shouldn't be littering, but that ending was rubbish!"
00:22:55.374,00:22:57.626,"Good morning, Squidward. I'll have the usual."
00:23:01.505,00:23:02.631,With cheese.
00:23:02.715,00:23:04.592,We're out of Krabby Patties right now!
00:23:04.717,00:23:07.261,No Krabby Patties?
00:23:07.803,00:23:10.055,No!
00:23:11.640,00:23:14.184,Look what's become of Bikini Bottom.
00:23:14.476,00:23:16.896,We've really gotta get that formula back.
00:23:16.979,00:23:20.566,"Hmm. Get the secret formula, you say?"
00:23:20.649,00:23:23.777,"Excuse me, I need a moment."
00:23:23.861,00:23:27.406,"With that formula, I could rule the world!"
00:23:31.493,00:23:33.078,"You know I can hear you, right?"
00:23:33.162,00:23:35.164,"Well, what do we do now?"
00:23:35.247,00:23:38.250,"Now we work together. You know, teamwork."
00:23:38.459,00:23:40.586,"What's, uh, tee-am work?"
00:23:40.669,00:23:42.087,"No, Plankton, teamwork."
00:23:42.755,00:23:43.631,Tee-am work.
00:23:43.839,00:23:45.049,-Teamwork. -Tie-'em work.
00:23:45.174,00:23:46.175,-Teamwork. -Tie 'em up!
00:23:46.342,00:23:48.594,"-Say team, like a sports... -Team."
00:23:48.761,00:23:50.387,-Team. Now say work. -Work.
00:23:50.512,00:23:51.680,Put them together. What do you got?
00:23:51.847,00:23:53.474,Time bomb work.
00:23:53.682,00:23:54.600,Getting better!
00:23:57.519,00:24:00.648,"Now, Bikini Bottom Action News!"
00:24:03.275,00:24:05.277,"Oh, hey, Patrick!"
00:24:05.361,00:24:08.906,"Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty!"
00:24:22.836,00:24:26.632,"Come on, tummy, it's gonna be a long day."
00:24:29.051,00:24:30.594,for an important news bulletin.
00:24:30.678,00:24:42.439,Perch Perkins reporting live Complete chaos here today as our town attempts to deal with a sudden and complete shortage of Krabby Patties. Whoa!
00:24:42.523,00:24:47.695,"Events here have this reporter wondering, what is the secret ingredient in Krabby Patties anyway?"
00:24:48.821,00:24:52.574,It's love! The secret ingredient is love!
00:24:56.036,00:24:59.915,"If I'd have known that, I'd have chewed it slower. Huh?"
00:25:01.542,00:25:03.585,What the corndog is that?
00:25:08.090,00:25:10.259,"Come on, Plankton, it's easy!"
00:25:10.426,00:25:15.305,"It means, I help you, you help me, and when we accomplish our goal, then we do hands in the middle."
00:25:15.389,00:25:18.392,"Hands in the middle? No, no. Sounds idiotic."
00:25:19.852,00:25:22.813,"Besides, the two of us are no match for that cranky mob!"
00:25:25.607,00:25:29.236,We could probably use a few more tee-am works.
00:25:29.611,00:25:30.863,That's exactly what I was thinking!
00:25:30.946,00:25:31.989,"Wait, what are you doing?"
00:25:37.286,00:25:39.038,need Krabby Patties!
00:25:41.707,00:25:42.916,Krabby Patties!
00:25:43.000,00:25:44.460,Vandalizing stuff.
00:25:44.668,00:25:46.253,Isn't that your house?
00:25:46.420,00:25:48.088,"Hey, what's with all the questions?"
00:25:48.172,00:25:49.465,Who are you guys?
00:25:49.631,00:25:52.009,"It's me, your best friend! SpongeBob?"
00:25:52.134,00:25:57.473,"Oh, yeah? Well, if you're SpongeBob, then what's the secret password?"
00:25:59.308,00:26:01.310,Correct! It is you!
00:26:01.393,00:26:03.437,-SpongeBob! -Whoa!
00:26:03.520,00:26:05.314,-SpongeBob. -Patrick!
00:26:07.191,00:26:10.736,Why aren't you at The Krusty Krab making Krabby Patties?
00:26:12.404,00:26:13.447,but the formula's gone.
00:26:13.530,00:26:15.574,"Yeah, Mr. Krabs says you and Plankton took it."
00:26:15.657,00:26:17.242,"No, that's not what happened."
00:26:17.326,00:26:18.786,It just disappeared.
00:26:18.869,00:26:20.746,We're putting a team together to find it.
00:26:20.829,00:26:22.247,A team?
00:26:22.331,00:26:24.708,Oh! Oh! Pick me! Pick me! Pick me!
00:26:24.875,00:26:26.126,"Okay, Patrick, you're in."
00:26:27.836,00:26:31.215,What exactly does this clown bring to the tee-am?
00:26:31.381,00:26:33.842,"He brings loyalty, Plankton."
00:26:33.926,00:26:36.136,"Loyalty. Isn't that right, Patrick?"
00:26:36.220,00:26:37.554,"Yeah, yeah, loyalty."
00:26:38.388,00:26:40.140,I've got SpongeBob!
00:26:40.390,00:26:42.726,He's over here!
00:26:49.441,00:26:52.069,"Come on, SpongeBob, let's get out of here!"
00:26:52.152,00:26:53.195,Patrick!
00:26:54.988,00:26:56.907,"Patrick, why are you doing this?"
00:26:56.990,00:27:01.203,Because I need Krabby Patties!
00:27:01.286,00:27:03.288,Hurry up! I'm hungry!
00:27:12.214,00:27:15.634,"Guys, am I still on the team?"
00:27:15.717,00:27:17.469,"Hey, what are you looking at?"
00:27:23.725,00:27:24.893,Sandy!
00:27:27.771,00:27:29.106,Sandy!
00:27:35.154,00:27:36.029,Sandy?
00:27:37.072,00:27:39.324,"Sandy, are you home?"
00:27:39.658,00:27:41.785,"Gee, Plankton, I wonder where she is."
00:27:41.994,00:27:43.996,What is all this stuff?
00:27:45.205,00:27:46.206,Sandy?
00:27:53.046,00:27:55.174,Sandy? Are you okay?
00:27:57.092,00:28:01.430,Have you looked outside? Does that seem okay to you?
00:28:01.513,00:28:04.349,I'm trying to figure out what happened to society.
00:28:04.975,00:28:08.061,"If we don't fix it soon, there won't be anything left to fix!"
00:28:08.937,00:28:10.105,Sandy?
00:28:10.480,00:28:12.357,The lack of Krabby Patties has driven her mad.
00:28:13.066,00:28:14.776,And I think I figgered it out.
00:28:15.235,00:28:16.278,Look.
00:28:18.363,00:28:24.912,"When this came down from above, I knew it could only mean one thing."
00:28:25.287,00:28:26.580,And that would be?
00:28:27.706,00:28:30.876,It means it's the end!
00:28:31.043,00:28:34.671,The sandwich gods are angry with us!
00:28:36.340,00:28:39.927,I just don't know how we're going to appease them!
00:28:48.810,00:28:50.312,who aren't dim bulbs or nut jobs?
00:28:50.395,00:28:54.316,"Well, I have one friend who's loyal to the very end."
00:29:01.198,00:29:02.741,"Gary, I'm home."
00:29:03.659,00:29:04.785,Gare-bear?
00:29:06.828,00:29:07.913,Gary?
00:29:08.330,00:29:09.414,Gary?
00:29:10.290,00:29:12.167,-Ugh. -Huh?
00:29:12.251,00:29:13.293,Revolting!
00:29:13.377,00:29:15.254,But it means Gary is close by!
00:29:15.337,00:29:17.297,"Gary, I'm back!"
00:29:19.132,00:29:20.217,Whoa.
00:29:22.844,00:29:31.144,"Oh, hey, Gary. Plankton and I need you to help us find the Krabby Patty formula What do you mean, you don't have to do as I say anymore?"
00:29:32.938,00:29:34.147,King of Snails?
00:29:34.398,00:29:37.526,"Gary The Snail, you get down here right now and join this team!"
00:29:39.194,00:29:40.862,"What do you mean, Seize them?"
00:29:46.827,00:29:48.870,Because they're right on our tail.
00:29:53.041,00:29:54.710,"Oh, right, snails."
00:29:54.793,00:29:57.713,"Well, so much for your tee-am."
00:29:57.796,00:30:01.466,Putting together a team is a lot harder than I thought it would be!
00:30:03.093,00:30:05.679,We better get out of here until things cool off.
00:30:20.610,00:30:24.990,"Oh, yeah, looks like they're gonna have to change the name of Bikini Bottom to Dirty Bottom."
00:30:28.160,00:30:29.995,"That's kind of gross, Plankton."
00:30:30.078,00:30:32.414,"Yeah. Yeah, too soon, huh?"
00:30:33.582,00:30:36.376,This feels like it really is the end.
00:30:37.336,00:30:45.761,"Don't worry, SpongeBob, we'll find the secret formula and everything will go back to the way it was, you know, all happy and junk."
00:30:47.971,00:30:51.266,Now let's try and get some sleep.
00:30:55.270,00:30:57.606,"Yeah, I guess you're right."
00:31:01.693,00:31:04.780,Here you are. Feel comfy?
00:31:05.197,00:31:10.494,"You know, Plankton, I think you might know a little bit more about teamwork than you let on."
00:31:11.370,00:31:12.788,"Good night, SpongeBob."
00:31:13.455,00:31:14.956,"Good night, Plankton."
00:31:18.460,00:31:20.754,"Good night, indeed."
00:31:21.630,00:31:24.174,"That's right, SpongeBob, sleep."
00:31:24.341,00:31:27.135,You're hiding that formula in there somewhere.
00:31:28.720,00:31:29.596,Huh?
00:31:32.015,00:31:34.518,"Well, here goes nothing."
00:31:36.645,00:31:37.687,Huh?
00:31:41.858,00:31:44.986,What is this place?
00:31:52.577,00:31:55.163,Ew! It's so sweet in here!
00:31:55.247,00:31:57.624,I think my eyeball is getting a toothache!
00:31:59.543,00:32:00.919,Come and play with us.
00:32:03.171,00:32:05.382,before we melt.
00:32:14.850,00:32:15.934,Whoa...
00:32:34.619,00:32:36.371,So much sweetness.
00:32:39.958,00:32:40.876,Huh?
00:32:42.878,00:32:43.837,Daddy!
00:32:48.383,00:32:50.594,"Uh, Plankton? Oh, Plankton!"
00:32:50.677,00:32:53.388,I just had the craziest dream! And you were in it!
00:32:53.472,00:32:54.723,I'm sure it was nothing.
00:32:56.558,00:32:57.934,Now go back to sleep.
00:32:58.018,00:32:59.394,Were you in my brain?
00:32:59.561,00:33:02.564,What? No! That's crazy talk!
00:33:02.772,00:33:05.859,Then why is there cotton candy on your antenna?
00:33:06.109,00:33:08.904,"Because, uh, because, uh..."
00:33:08.987,00:33:10.906,"Okay, fine, I was in your brain."
00:33:13.241,00:33:14.910,What do you think I was doing?
00:33:14.993,00:33:16.620,Looking for the secret formula.
00:33:16.703,00:33:18.788,-What? -Don't act so innocent.
00:33:18.872,00:33:20.373,You knew what I was up to.
00:33:20.540,00:33:22.918,That's why you're pretending not to know the formula.
00:33:23.001,00:33:24.252,I'm not pretending!
00:33:24.336,00:33:26.171,I can't believe you thought I was lying.
00:33:26.254,00:33:27.923,"Hey, don't take it personally."
00:33:28.006,00:33:29.758,I just assume everyone is lying.
00:33:29.841,00:33:33.261,That is a horrible way -to live your life. -Whatever.
00:33:33.345,00:33:36.139,It is! And if we're going to be on the same team...
00:33:36.348,00:33:40.727,Maybe I don't want to be on the tee-am! You think of that?
00:33:40.894,00:33:47.609,"But, Plankton, everything's better You're not going to start singing, are you?"
00:34:35.115,00:34:36.157,Come on.
00:34:50.755,00:34:52.924,"All right, you can put me down."
00:34:54.759,00:34:57.012,That's one minute of my life I'll never get back.
00:34:57.095,00:34:58.513,Not without a time machine.
00:34:58.597,00:35:00.515,Wait a minute. Hold that thought.
00:35:06.102,00:35:06.980,Slow down.
00:35:10.066,00:35:11.109,Hmm.
00:35:11.860,00:35:12.736,Yes!
00:35:13.820,00:35:16.823,"-SpongeBob, you're a genius! -I am?"
00:35:16.990,00:35:21.828,"If we build a time machine, we can go back to before the formula disappeared."
00:35:21.911,00:35:25.540,Before society broke down. Before we became the hunted!
00:35:25.624,00:35:29.919,"That sounds great, Plankton, but how do we build a time machine?"
00:35:30.086,00:35:35.175,"Well, first we'll need a computer powerful enough to calculate the intricacies of time travel."
00:35:35.258,00:35:36.635,Where would we get one of those?
00:35:36.718,00:35:37.761,Hmm.
00:35:41.640,00:35:43.725,They've got her tied up in the back room.
00:35:43.933,00:35:46.061,I've never seen this many people at The Chum Bucket.
00:35:46.144,00:35:47.270,I've never seen anyone there.
00:35:47.354,00:35:48.563,Now was that really necessary?
00:35:48.647,00:35:49.898,Cause the food's really bad.
00:35:49.981,00:35:51.566,"-Oh, come on! Really? -Shh!"
00:35:51.650,00:35:53.860,How are we gonna sneak past those guards?
00:35:54.027,00:35:55.153,Hmm.
00:36:03.912,00:36:06.498,"Well, what do we have here?"
00:36:10.377,00:36:13.129,We better hurry. Those guys really hate tires.
00:36:18.802,00:36:21.680,We'll never get in. The door's locked.
00:36:23.556,00:36:25.809,Wait. The window is open.
00:36:26.351,00:36:29.187,"Come on, Plankton, it's time for some teamwork. Give me a boost."
00:36:29.270,00:36:31.272,"Okay. Wait a minute, no!"
00:36:33.775,00:36:35.735,"Just a little higher, Plankton."
00:36:36.569,00:36:37.737,Plankton?
00:36:39.197,00:36:43.201,Why don't you boost me up instead?
00:36:43.368,00:36:44.619,"Oh, yeah, good thinking."
00:36:57.841,00:36:58.800,We're in!
00:37:00.385,00:37:01.261,Shh!
00:37:01.678,00:37:03.304,There's a guard over there.
00:37:04.180,00:37:06.599,Let's take the key from around his neck.
00:37:06.766,00:37:08.893,We're gonna have to be very quiet.
00:37:08.977,00:37:11.438,Let's walk on the tips of our toes.
00:37:23.408,00:37:25.326,Will you stop playing that tiny piano?
00:37:30.498,00:37:33.501,Now just reach over and grab it.
00:37:36.588,00:37:38.757,Halt! Who goes there?
00:37:49.058,00:37:51.811,-Stop! Pull it over his head! -Oh.
00:37:54.105,00:37:55.231,"Stop, stop, stop!"
00:37:58.610,00:38:00.236,Let me get up there.
00:38:29.224,00:38:30.642,Help me.
00:38:37.899,00:38:39.067,No!
00:38:42.779,00:38:44.697,"I'll rock him, you tell him a bedtime story."
00:38:46.699,00:38:50.036,there was a big fat pink idiot who went to sleep. The end!
00:38:50.203,00:38:53.039,"Nice try, but it's gonna take more than that to..."
00:38:59.170,00:39:03.424,"I told you, I don't have the formula, you monsters!"
00:39:03.633,00:39:05.969,"-Hey, baby, how are you? -Plankton!"
00:39:06.135,00:39:10.181,"My hero! You must need something, otherwise you wouldn't have come back."
00:39:10.348,00:39:12.684,Plankton has a plan to save Bikini Bottom.
00:39:16.980,00:39:20.859,"It doesn't matter, Plankton. Krabs knows all your plans."
00:39:21.025,00:39:23.987,He's been through my hard drive looking for the secret formula.
00:39:24.195,00:39:27.073,"Eh, I never had it. But we're going to get it."
00:39:27.156,00:39:31.077,We're gonna go back in time to steal the formula before it disappeared.
00:39:31.202,00:39:32.287,Time travel!
00:39:32.453,00:39:34.664,Where are you gonna find a computer that can do that?
00:39:34.789,00:39:36.040,Wait a minute!
00:39:40.420,00:39:41.921,I've never carried a head before.
00:39:46.217,00:39:48.094,"So you won't talk, huh?"
00:39:59.439,00:40:00.523,A photo booth.
00:40:03.735,00:40:04.903,Some day-old chips.
00:40:05.111,00:40:07.113,Now all we have to do is build it.
00:40:10.074,00:40:11.117,"Hey, my pitch pipe!"
00:40:11.200,00:40:13.745,"Uh, I need it. For the time machine."
00:40:20.209,00:40:21.544,Installed!
00:40:33.806,00:40:34.933,Mmm.
00:40:41.773,00:40:43.358,I did it!
00:40:43.441,00:40:45.610,"No, we did it!"
00:40:45.693,00:40:47.487,Wait. We did do it.
00:40:47.612,00:40:48.863,As a tee-am.
00:40:48.947,00:40:50.698,-A team. -Whatever.
00:41:00.583,00:41:02.877,"Okay, now for the brains!"
00:41:04.295,00:41:06.547,"Okay, Plankton, this is it."
00:41:06.756,00:41:10.259,It's gonna take all my processors and energy to power this time machine.
00:41:10.426,00:41:13.930,"So if you have anything you wanna tell me, you better tell me now."
00:41:14.806,00:41:16.057,"Well, Karen..."
00:41:16.474,00:41:25.942,"I know I've taken you for granted all these years, and I, I just wanted to say, I'm glad you're on my tee-am."
00:41:26.025,00:41:35.576,"Oh, Sheldon, that's the sweetest thing you've ever-- Plankton, are you crying?"
00:41:35.660,00:41:37.495,"No, no, no!"
00:41:37.662,00:41:40.581,It's just one of the hazards of having a giant eyeball.
00:41:40.915,00:41:42.875,There's always stuff getting in there.
00:41:44.836,00:41:46.421,Say cheese.
00:41:47.839,00:41:49.257,Cheese!
00:42:14.907,00:42:17.910,The Krusty Krab should be right here!
00:42:17.994,00:42:19.829,What's that over there?
00:42:21.164,00:42:23.374,-SpongeBob? -Patrick?
00:42:23.541,00:42:24.876,Is it really you?
00:42:25.043,00:42:27.128,"-Yes, Patrick, it's... -Finally!"
00:42:27.211,00:42:30.965,The Great Krabby Patty Famine is over!
00:42:31.174,00:42:34.552,"Great Krabby Patty Famine? Oh, what year is this?"
00:42:34.635,00:42:35.887,It's Thursday.
00:42:35.970,00:42:40.641,"According to my calculations, we've only gone four days into the future."
00:42:40.725,00:42:42.393,Where is everybody?
00:42:42.477,00:42:46.230,They all gave up on you. But not me!
00:42:46.314,00:42:48.399,Cause I'm not very smart.
00:42:49.067,00:42:51.027,Where is The Krusty Krab?
00:42:51.235,00:42:52.987,Right where it's always been!
00:43:20.765,00:43:23.726,"I think we may be lost in time, Plankton."
00:43:24.060,00:43:26.270,Maybe we should ask this guy for directions.
00:43:27.522,00:43:31.275,"Excuse me, sir? Can you tell us when we are?"
00:43:31.359,00:43:35.780,Who dares disturb The One Who Watches?
00:43:37.907,00:43:39.826,Your name is The One Who Watches?
00:43:39.909,00:43:44.789,"No, my true name is Bubbles."
00:43:47.917,00:43:50.628,What kind of a name is Bubbles?
00:43:50.878,00:43:53.422,It is my ancient dolphin name.
00:43:53.631,00:43:56.467,So what's a dolphin doing out here in the middle of space?
00:43:56.717,00:44:04.433,My kind have been watching and protecting Hmm.
00:44:04.517,00:44:06.811,Ten thousand years!
00:44:06.894,00:44:11.149,"Oh, so you're the one keeping the meteors from hitting us."
00:44:12.817,00:44:15.486,And I could really do with a potty break.
00:44:15.570,00:44:18.156,Would you mind keeping an eye on things?
00:44:18.906,00:44:22.285,"Sure thing. But, uh, what am I keeping my eye on?"
00:44:32.086,00:44:33.212,What are you doing?
00:44:33.337,00:44:34.672,I'm watching.
00:44:34.755,00:44:36.340,We don't even know what we're watching for.
00:44:38.801,00:44:42.346,"You watch the one with the big red eye, I'll watch the one with the ringy thingies."
00:44:42.471,00:44:43.723,Like a team.
00:44:44.307,00:44:45.725,"Okay, mine's moving."
00:44:45.892,00:44:47.059,"Mine, too."
00:44:48.227,00:44:49.687,"No, this doesn't seem right."
00:44:49.854,00:44:50.897,Should we call Bubbles?
00:44:50.980,00:44:51.898,Let's give him a minute.
00:44:51.981,00:44:53.524,"He's been holding it for 10,000 years."
00:44:58.321,00:45:00.448,I'm pretty sure that wasn't supposed to happen.
00:45:00.531,00:45:12.001,"Come on, Plankton, we got to clean this up Much better. Yes."
00:45:12.210,00:45:14.795,You two are free to go.
00:45:19.175,00:45:21.802,What happened to Saturn and Jupiter?
00:45:33.606,00:45:35.775,Keep them from smashing into each other!
00:45:35.858,00:45:36.943,Sorry.
00:45:39.612,00:45:42.990,And you will lose your lives.
00:45:50.623,00:45:51.958,Quarter me!
00:46:19.068,00:46:20.236,SpongeBob!
00:46:24.073,00:46:25.408,SpongeBob?
00:46:25.491,00:46:27.201,Who are you two supposed to be?
00:46:27.368,00:46:29.161,"I'm you, from the future."
00:46:29.245,00:46:30.913,And I'm him from the future.
00:46:31.122,00:46:34.625,So you traveled back through time to help me? Great thinking.
00:46:34.709,00:46:36.085,Nope. He's helping me.
00:46:37.670,00:46:39.964,Was the enemy. Now we're a team.
00:46:40.047,00:46:42.049,What? A tee-am?
00:46:42.216,00:46:43.801,A team!
00:46:43.968,00:46:46.053,"All right, go get the formula."
00:46:47.013,00:46:48.222,What have I become?
00:46:48.389,00:46:49.640,"All right, Plankton."
00:46:51.726,00:46:53.894,Do you have flying boatmobiles in the future?
00:46:53.978,00:46:57.481,"We only came back from the day after tomorrow, dimwit."
00:46:57.565,00:46:59.191,Are there rocket packs?
00:47:00.943,00:47:03.446,Did they outlaw -clothes in the future? -No!
00:47:03.529,00:47:04.613,Then why are you naked?
00:47:04.697,00:47:06.991,Because they don't make clothes in my size.
00:47:07.116,00:47:08.117,"Hold still, you!"
00:47:09.827,00:47:13.331,"If you're from the future, what am I gonna say next?"
00:47:13.414,00:47:15.541,-Something moronic? -Wow.
00:47:15.624,00:47:17.418,"Hey, hurry up over there!"
00:47:18.878,00:47:20.504,Uh-oh. That ain't good.
00:47:22.590,00:47:24.967,"Come on, SpongeBob, we gotta get out of here!"
00:47:26.260,00:47:28.596,-Got it! -Come on!
00:47:38.147,00:47:40.191,"Oh, that was crazy!"
00:47:40.274,00:47:42.610,So that's what teamwork is.
00:47:42.943,00:47:47.073,"All those years I tried to make you mine, and I finally did it."
00:47:47.698,00:47:49.658,"I mean, we did it!"
00:47:53.204,00:47:58.000,our heroes have accomplished all they had set out to do.
00:47:59.418,00:48:00.878,-Now that's an ending. -Whoo-hoo!
00:48:10.888,00:48:13.974,So you mean the ending might be even happier?
00:48:19.480,00:48:22.817,Land ho!
00:48:29.740,00:48:30.616,What?
00:48:41.085,00:48:43.546,"I'm coming! Come on, you lazy people!"
00:48:50.010,00:48:51.095,Sorry!
00:48:51.262,00:48:53.431,-Too fast! -Slow down!
00:49:11.449,00:49:12.992,Yeah!
00:49:13.075,00:49:16.829,"All right, you feathered rats, time to shove off!"
00:49:16.996,00:49:19.165,What? Why?
00:49:19.373,00:49:24.879,"Well, I can't have you pooping all over my restaurant, can I?"
00:49:25.045,00:49:27.256,Restaurant? I thought this was a pirate ship.
00:49:28.132,00:49:29.925,"Oh, it is."
00:49:30.342,00:49:31.802,But it is also...
00:49:43.731,00:49:44.940,A-ha!
00:49:50.196,00:49:52.781,"Uh, you know, a restaurant on wheels."
00:49:52.948,00:49:54.867,-Like a garbage truck. -No!
00:49:54.992,00:49:57.244,Are you trying to scare away my customers?
00:49:57.411,00:50:00.247,"Well, we're not leaving till we see how the story ends."
00:50:00.873,00:50:02.249,No problem.
00:50:02.416,00:50:06.587,You guys like a little snack while you wait?
00:50:06.795,00:50:08.631,"-Sure, I'll take a curdled milk. -How about a fish head?"
00:50:08.714,00:50:10.174,And a French fry covered in sand.
00:50:10.466,00:50:15.221,Who wants some hot wings?
00:50:15.387,00:50:17.097,Wait a minute. Where's Kyle?
00:50:18.015,00:50:20.935,Which one of you is next?
00:50:24.855,00:50:26.732,"You crazy, man! You crazy!"
00:50:31.362,00:50:32.613,Now I can get my gold sticker.
00:50:34.740,00:50:36.450,"Oh, hey, Mr. Piwate."
00:50:47.294,00:50:48.796,"Where to, Mac?"
00:50:48.879,00:50:50.464,Just dwive.
00:50:58.222,00:50:59.807,Oh...
00:51:00.349,00:51:03.227,-Squidward! -Still out of Krabby Patties.
00:51:05.646,00:51:10.859,Does anyone have a picture I done figgered it out!
00:51:12.903,00:51:19.577,We have angered the sandwich gods and only a sacrifice will appease them!
00:51:19.994,00:51:21.412,"Well, that sounds reasonable."
00:51:21.579,00:51:29.086,"Soon our post-apoca-whatchamacallit will be over, and Krabby Patties will rain down from above!"
00:51:29.169,00:51:31.630,"Rain down? Well, that's no good."
00:51:31.714,00:51:33.382,How will I get me money?
00:51:33.632,00:51:36.760,"Oh, you don't like that idea? Then we'll sacrifice you!"
00:51:45.185,00:51:49.523,It's not a good idea to have a sacrifice on an empty stomach.
00:51:49.940,00:51:51.942,Who wants a Krabby Patty?
00:51:54.194,00:51:57.031,"SpongeBob, is that me formuler?"
00:51:57.114,00:51:58.782,"Oh, happy day!"
00:52:00.075,00:52:01.535,I missed you so much.
00:52:01.744,00:52:03.871,Where was it? Where did you find it?
00:52:03.954,00:52:09.918,"Well, Plankton and I built a time machine out of an old photo booth and then we added-- -Cheese! -Patrick, wait!"
00:52:12.630,00:52:15.382,The post-apocalypse is almost over!
00:52:18.802,00:52:20.804,"Ain't that right, SpongeBob?"
00:52:21.847,00:52:26.143,"Eugene, eat my subaquatic air bubbles."
00:52:26.226,00:52:27.561,"Love, Plankton?"
00:52:30.939,00:52:32.566,"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs!"
00:52:32.650,00:52:34.568,"That's okay, SpongeBob."
00:52:34.652,00:52:37.696,We'll just have to sacrifice the two of you then.
00:52:37.780,00:52:40.491,Prepare them for the sacrifice!
00:52:42.451,00:52:45.954,I bring a message from the dawn of time!
00:52:46.121,00:52:47.122,"What is it, Patrick?"
00:52:51.960,00:52:54.129,Squidosaurus Rex!
00:53:04.473,00:53:08.060,"Well, Plankton, I guess we failed to accomplish our goals."
00:53:08.143,00:53:09.103,We?
00:53:09.687,00:53:14.066,"But even failure hurts a little less when you do it as a team, right?"
00:53:14.149,00:53:15.818,This is all your fault!
00:53:17.986,00:53:19.154,My fault?
00:53:19.238,00:53:21.949,You're the one who stole the wrong secret formula.
00:53:22.032,00:53:23.701,I didn't know there were two bottles.
00:53:23.784,00:53:25.786,Of course you didn't!
00:53:25.953,00:53:28.455,Because you got cotton candy for brains!
00:53:30.082,00:53:32.084,"No, seriously, he really does."
00:53:32.209,00:53:36.213,"Well, we wouldn't even be in this mess in the first place, if you weren't so selfish and evil."
00:53:36.296,00:53:41.135,"I was selfish and evil, until you ruined everything with your teamwork!"
00:53:41.343,00:53:43.220,Oh! You take that back!
00:53:43.429,00:53:46.515,You are the worst teammate ever!
00:53:46.682,00:53:47.599,No!
00:53:58.277,00:54:01.697,"Oh, my Neptune, he's mixing garbage and recycling!"
00:54:12.082,00:54:13.250,Look at me.
00:54:14.585,00:54:16.336,"Why, I've become like all of you."
00:54:17.546,00:54:18.797,Savage.
00:54:19.173,00:54:20.299,Fear-ridden.
00:54:20.424,00:54:21.425,Selfish.
00:54:22.050,00:54:29.767,"An entire town of formerly good citizens turned into heartless freaks, bent on their own self-prever..."
00:54:29.850,00:54:31.393,Self-preter...
00:54:31.477,00:54:33.854,-Preservation? -Yes!
00:54:33.937,00:54:36.732,We've become alienated from each other.
00:54:36.815,00:54:41.320,"Each one an island unto himself, concerned only with ourselves."
00:54:41.403,00:54:45.574,"And in the name of all fishhood, I am not about to let that happen!"
00:54:50.078,00:54:55.876,"And so, if a sacrifice is needed to restore Bikini Bottom to its former glory..."
00:54:57.878,00:55:00.881,Then I am willing to take one for the team!
00:55:12.434,00:55:13.477,You heard him!
00:55:16.647,00:55:19.733,Sacrifice! Sacrifice!
00:55:19.858,00:55:21.235,Sacrifice!
00:55:21.735,00:55:24.321,Sacrifice! Sacrifice!
00:55:28.492,00:55:32.287,Let the sacrifice begin!
00:55:35.791,00:55:38.502,And I thought my friends were primitive.
00:55:40.170,00:55:41.755,"Don't cry, me boy."
00:55:41.839,00:55:45.008,"Everything's going to be fine, for us."
00:55:47.761,00:55:49.221,I smell Krabby Patties!
00:55:49.346,00:55:53.892,That's right. Keep thinking happy thoughts. Now!
00:56:07.948,00:56:09.449,The boy's right.
00:56:11.201,00:56:12.578,"I smell 'em, too!"
00:56:12.661,00:56:14.955,"Okay, SpongeBob, go get it!"
00:56:15.038,00:56:18.208,Wait. You mean we can just take this stuff off?
00:56:18.709,00:56:20.419,Go find that Krabby Patty!
00:56:24.131,00:56:25.382,"Come on, everybody!"
00:56:25.465,00:56:28.135,I've got some Krabby Patty orders to fill!
00:56:36.393,00:56:38.562,It's coming from over there!
00:57:00.792,00:57:03.337,"Come on, guys, I think it's just over this hill."
00:57:08.133,00:57:10.135,How do you expect us to go up to the surface?
00:57:10.218,00:57:11.428,We won't be able to breathe!
00:57:11.511,00:57:17.851,"All right, all secondary characters Yeah, I'm with you guys. No way, Squidward."
00:57:17.935,00:57:20.187,You're going up there with us.
00:57:20.270,00:57:21.688,My feet hurt.
00:57:24.566,00:57:27.110,It's not fair! You have feet.
00:57:27.194,00:57:31.031,Sandy has feet. Squidward has feet.
00:57:31.156,00:57:32.783,"Actually, I have four feet."
00:57:41.625,00:57:43.669,"and sticking together, no matter what!"
00:57:43.835,00:57:49.591,The only way we're going up there is if some fairy godmother shows up and helps us breathe air.
00:57:54.888,00:57:57.724,"-Bubbles! -SpongeBob, you know this guy?"
00:57:57.808,00:57:59.935,Don't hurt us! We're sorry we got you fired.
00:58:02.312,00:58:05.440,"Why, I traveled back through time to thank you."
00:58:05.691,00:58:08.318,I've been stuck in that job for eons.
00:58:08.694,00:58:13.615,"I needed a change, but I was too afraid to go for it."
00:58:13.991,00:58:16.743,"Well, Bubbles, I'm glad we could help."
00:58:16.827,00:58:19.538,Now it is my turn to help.
00:58:19.621,00:58:22.290,I can get you safely to the surface.
00:58:24.209,00:58:27.587,"Quick, all of you, get in my mouth."
00:58:27.671,00:58:29.089,"Come on, guys, let's go!"
00:58:29.172,00:58:32.384,There's no way I'm climbing into some dolphin's mouth.
00:58:32.467,00:58:35.095,Yeah. This guy just wants a free lunch.
00:58:35.178,00:58:43.103,"Guys, if Bubbles has the courage to quit his dead-end, nowhere job and travel back through time to help us, then we need to have the courage to..."
00:58:48.066,00:58:50.277,"Well, I never thought I'd be eaten by a dolphin."
00:58:50.360,00:58:53.864,"No, if he was eating us, he'd be chewing us up and we'd be going down there."
00:58:53.947,00:58:56.324,This is what you call riding in style.
00:58:58.827,00:59:01.538,"Well, maybe if you didn't have four feet!"
00:59:02.956,00:59:06.168,Note to self: Never stow away in a gym sock.
00:59:17.596,00:59:20.223,What's happening? I feel tingly!
00:59:32.110,00:59:33.945,I've done all I can.
00:59:34.404,00:59:36.573,The rest is up to you.
00:59:36.656,00:59:38.075,"Thank you, Bubbles!"
00:59:38.366,00:59:40.202,"Farewell, SpongeBob."
00:59:40.285,00:59:41.787,"Farewell, Bubbles."
00:59:46.750,00:59:48.335,Resume!
00:59:52.589,00:59:56.009,"Ah! Fresh air! Oh, how I've missed you."
00:59:56.093,00:59:58.637,Ugh! This place smells awful!
01:00:00.263,01:00:03.100,Let's get the Krabby Patty formula and save Bikini Bottom.
01:00:04.851,01:00:06.144,Whoa!
01:00:06.228,01:00:08.313,What is this place?
01:00:11.525,01:00:14.903,Maybe this guy knows where we are. He looks smart.
01:00:14.986,01:00:16.571,He's got five heads.
01:00:16.655,01:00:19.825,"Uh, sir? Could you tell us where to find a Krabby Patty?"
01:00:20.075,01:00:22.327,"Hey, my friend's talking to you!"
01:00:26.957,01:00:28.625,"A giant, hairy porpoise!"
01:00:31.253,01:00:34.422,It's suffering. Poor thing.
01:00:34.589,01:00:35.715,"Y'all, those aren't porpoises."
01:00:35.799,01:00:37.926,"-All hands on deck! -Oh, brother."
01:00:38.635,01:00:40.679,We need to get these guys back in the water.
01:00:52.691,01:00:54.192,"Come on, push!"
01:00:57.154,01:00:58.989,horrible smell was coming from.
01:01:12.586,01:01:13.712,Whoa!
01:01:13.879,01:01:17.132,"Excuse me, do you know where we can get a Krabby Patty around here?"
01:01:17.340,01:01:18.800,Invaders!
01:01:18.967,01:01:20.051,Uh-oh.
01:01:20.135,01:01:22.804,You get out of my sister's sand castle!
01:01:36.318,01:01:37.319,Oh!
01:01:39.196,01:01:41.698,Where have you been all my life?
01:01:46.536,01:01:47.829,Ow. Whoa!
01:01:49.915,01:01:51.374,"Oh, Frank."
01:01:52.042,01:01:53.919,That feels so good.
01:01:56.213,01:01:57.214,Gross!
01:02:04.095,01:02:05.472,The Krabby Patty!
01:02:05.555,01:02:06.932,I think I see where it's coming from!
01:02:20.403,01:02:23.823,"SpongeBob, you will not believe the size of the ice creams here."
01:02:23.907,01:02:26.159,I wonder what other giant snacks they have.
01:02:30.997,01:02:32.374,Wow.
01:02:32.457,01:02:35.418,"If you ate all that, you'd have enough energy to run around the whole world!"
01:02:58.316,01:03:00.902,Ugh! When is the sugar gonna wear off?
01:03:07.575,01:03:09.828,"Hey, guys, I smell Krabby Patties!"
01:03:09.953,01:03:11.871,-I think it's this way! -Huh?
01:03:23.341,01:03:25.719,-Now what? -We're never going to make it!
01:03:32.559,01:03:34.269,-Heave! -Ho!
01:03:34.352,01:03:35.937,-Heave! -Ho!
01:03:36.021,01:03:37.314,-Heave! -Ho!
01:03:39.941,01:03:41.943,"We're doing it, guys!"
01:03:45.655,01:03:46.990,Hold on!
01:04:04.758,01:04:07.135,Home of the Krabby Patty?
01:04:09.387,01:04:12.140,But The Krusty Krab is the home of the Krabby Patty!
01:04:12.390,01:04:13.933,"Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do?"
01:04:14.017,01:04:16.186,$8.99 for a Krabby Patty?
01:04:16.269,01:04:18.605,Why didn't I think of that?
01:04:31.576,01:04:33.119,-You! -Huh?
01:04:34.662,01:04:37.374,Cease and desist that unauthorized patty flipping!
01:04:37.540,01:04:39.125,"Yeah, that's my job!"
01:04:41.252,01:04:42.921,You cannot breathe air.
01:04:43.046,01:04:47.133,"Well, there was this magical dolphin from the future who shot us out of his blowhole, and..."
01:04:47.342,01:04:48.301,Wait! Wait.
01:04:53.139,01:04:54.599,That's not in the book.
01:04:54.724,01:04:55.725,Book?
01:04:55.892,01:04:58.269,There is no magical dolphin in this story.
01:04:58.436,01:04:59.896,What story?
01:05:01.231,01:05:12.867,"The story of how Bikini Bottom was brought to its knees when its beloved Krabby Patty formula was stolen by me, Burger Beard."
01:05:14.327,01:05:15.870,How does it end?
01:05:16.287,01:05:17.789,"Well, let me see."
01:05:18.581,01:05:28.591,"It looks like, uh, Burger Beard becomes the richest food truck proprietor in all the land."
01:05:28.758,01:05:31.010,But how did you steal the formula?
01:05:31.094,01:05:32.220,That was easy.
01:05:32.929,01:05:36.182,"I simply rewrote the story, and..."
01:05:36.266,01:05:37.308,Poof!
01:05:39.269,01:05:41.312,"What do you mean, rewrote the story?"
01:05:41.479,01:05:42.689,Watch this.
01:05:44.107,01:05:57.120,The brave and handsome Burger Beard ...to be stranded on Pelican Island!
01:06:00.415,01:06:02.500,The End!
01:06:07.297,01:06:08.840,"Oh, this looks bad."
01:06:09.174,01:06:10.967,And these guys look hungry!
01:06:19.767,01:06:22.479,Nice. So this is what teamwork gets you.
01:06:23.021,01:06:25.273,"Here! Take Squidward, you vile beasts!"
01:06:25.440,01:06:28.651,I want to be on a new team. This one's broken.
01:06:28.735,01:06:30.570,"Sandy, you're smart. You have any ideas?"
01:06:31.404,01:06:35.867,I ain't been too smart since I found this old piece of paper!
01:06:49.005,01:06:50.131,Wait a minute!
01:06:54.886,01:06:56.387,Oh. Which Squidward has helpfully provided.
01:06:58.097,01:06:59.849,It happens when I'm nervous.
01:07:01.059,01:07:04.812,"Whatever you're going to do, make it quick! They're closing in on us!"
01:07:04.896,01:07:06.397,I'm gonna write us an ending.
01:07:08.608,01:07:10.193,Will it be a happy ending?
01:07:10.276,01:07:12.654,It's going to be superpowered!
01:07:21.788,01:07:24.791,I'll show you a happy ending.
01:07:37.220,01:07:38.388,Huh?
01:07:41.474,01:07:42.642,Da-da-da-da!
01:07:42.725,01:07:44.060,-Patrick! -Huh?
01:07:45.728,01:07:47.230,"Hey, I got feet!"
01:07:48.147,01:07:50.567,"Oh, what is in these things?"
01:07:52.402,01:07:56.030,We'll take one secret formula to go!
01:07:59.158,01:08:00.493,"Clear the area, citizens."
01:08:00.577,01:08:03.454,There's going to be some serious aft-kicking here.
01:08:06.624,01:08:09.586,But I banished you.
01:08:09.752,01:08:10.878,Sour Note?
01:08:23.349,01:08:26.311,"Hey, hey, wait! Hold on! Hold on!"
01:08:26.477,01:08:29.147,Wait! Wait! Customers!
01:08:29.314,01:08:31.316,"Wait, please!"
01:08:34.193,01:08:35.320,take him down.
01:08:36.821,01:08:38.531,-Huh? -Huh?
01:08:53.129,01:08:56.174,"Um, maybe we should have picked a better superpower for you, Patrick."
01:08:58.551,01:09:01.137,Let's see you get out of this one!
01:09:08.186,01:09:11.022,Get ready for the Invinci-Bubble!
01:09:14.108,01:09:15.568,No!
01:09:15.735,01:09:17.111,My book!
01:09:18.946,01:09:22.200,"All right, team, time for hands in the middle!"
01:09:22.283,01:09:23.660,Yes! Huh?
01:09:23.743,01:09:25.328,"Oh, yeah."
01:09:31.084,01:09:34.170,"Great job, guys. We did it!"
01:09:36.422,01:09:37.548,Huh?
01:09:37.715,01:09:38.716,What?
01:09:38.800,01:09:41.052,Sandy? Is that you?
01:09:41.219,01:09:44.138,You can call me The Rodent!
01:09:44.222,01:09:45.515,Hi-yah!
01:09:45.682,01:09:47.809,"Hey, where'd the pirate go?"
01:09:52.188,01:09:53.815,Hmm. Uh...
01:09:57.902,01:09:59.028,Mmm.
01:09:59.112,01:10:03.241,It looks like Burger Beard forgot the first rule of mobile fry cooking.
01:10:03.950,01:10:06.411,Always batten down your grease traps.
01:10:07.620,01:10:09.872,"Follow that grease, team!"
01:10:38.109,01:10:39.402,Whoo-hoo-hoo!
01:11:17.732,01:11:18.691,Ow!
01:11:41.464,01:11:43.424,He's after the book!
01:11:43.549,01:11:46.052,"Sandy, use your squirrel powers!"
01:11:46.177,01:11:47.053,Roger that!
01:11:53.059,01:11:54.477,"Oh, she's never gonna make it!"
01:11:56.354,01:11:57.939,Huh? Everyone...
01:11:58.439,01:11:59.774,Lean!
01:12:31.681,01:12:33.266,Come here.
01:12:33.349,01:12:34.433,Come here.
01:12:35.226,01:12:36.394,The book!
01:12:36.477,01:12:38.020,Sour Note!
01:12:52.869,01:12:56.747,"All right, Burger Beard, prepare to be teamworked!"
01:12:56.914,01:13:00.418,I'm going to scrub my armpits with you.
01:13:00.543,01:13:02.587,"Uh, I don't get it."
01:13:02.670,01:13:04.046,Because you're a sponge.
01:13:04.171,01:13:05.214,Duh.
01:13:05.381,01:13:06.424,Oh.
01:13:06.799,01:13:08.342,"Get him, The Rodent!"
01:13:20.813,01:13:21.981,Huh?
01:13:30.573,01:13:32.825,"Aw, nuts! I'm all out of nuts!"
01:13:38.122,01:13:42.043,Justice is best soft served.
01:13:48.132,01:13:50.968,"Patrick, I should have never doubted your powers!"
01:14:04.065,01:14:06.734,I can't think of a sweeter way to go.
01:14:07.610,01:14:10.571,Ha! It's all mine!
01:14:10.988,01:14:13.741,"Not so fast, Booger Beard!"
01:14:30.675,01:14:32.343,Me formuler. Huh?
01:14:33.844,01:14:36.055,This will make you feel a little butter.
01:14:37.807,01:14:39.141,Not melted butter!
01:14:43.229,01:14:44.438,Mr. Krabs!
01:14:49.694,01:14:50.903,Voila!
01:15:02.206,01:15:03.207,A-ha!
01:15:03.791,01:15:05.418,"Oh, yeah!"
01:15:05.793,01:15:06.919,Huh?
01:15:07.169,01:15:08.170,Hoo-hoo!
01:15:25.146,01:15:26.480,Ta-da!
01:15:30.735,01:15:32.153,They're beautiful!
01:15:52.214,01:15:53.340,SpongeBob!
01:15:53.632,01:15:56.093,"-Patrick? -Talk to me, buddy."
01:15:56.385,01:15:58.971,I'm... I'm seeing a bright light.
01:15:59.927,01:16:00.848,Is this better?
01:16:01.057,01:16:02.266,Much. Thank you.
01:16:02.725,01:16:09.607,But the discomfort I feel in my eyes is nothing compared to the shame I feel for letting down the Patty.
01:16:09.690,01:16:11.692,For letting down Bikini Bottom.
01:16:11.859,01:16:14.487,"Yeah, SpongeBob, you really blew it."
01:16:14.987,01:16:17.782,"No, Patrick, we blew it, as a team."
01:16:18.157,01:16:19.742,Nope. This one's on you.
01:16:30.503,01:16:34.423,"Why don't you get going, little fella, before you hurt yourself?"
01:16:46.310,01:16:47.478,Plankton?
01:16:48.062,01:16:50.106,It's Plank-Ton!
01:16:52.108,01:16:54.902,"Come on down from there, little fella."
01:16:55.736,01:16:57.696,You wouldn't want to get hurt.
01:16:59.198,01:17:00.658,Huh?
01:17:20.803,01:17:23.806,"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
01:17:26.100,01:17:27.351,My eye!
01:17:40.614,01:17:41.824,He's getting away!
01:17:44.869,01:17:47.538,Ready for a Plank-Ton of bubbles?
01:18:09.852,01:18:11.770,"The formula, please."
01:18:11.937,01:18:13.898,Come on. Team up with me.
01:18:13.981,01:18:16.025,We'll be rich and powerful! Huh?
01:18:17.359,01:18:19.445,I'm already part of a teamwork.
01:18:43.344,01:18:45.387,Can we do hands in the middle again?
01:18:45.471,01:18:46.764,"Yes, we can, Patrick."
01:18:46.847,01:18:49.600,"But this time, there's one more hand to go in the middle."
01:18:52.728,01:18:53.896,Plankton?
01:18:55.397,01:18:56.273,Hmm.
01:19:02.905,01:19:05.491,"Here you go, Krabs. Huh?"
01:19:05.699,01:19:07.159,She's all yours.
01:19:07.493,01:19:10.579,"This doesn't have another insulting note in it, does it?"
01:19:10.746,01:19:12.915,"No, that's the old me."
01:19:13.165,01:19:18.003,The one who turned his back on everything important just to have that formula all to himself.
01:19:18.420,01:19:22.258,But I realize now that keeping something to myself is...
01:19:23.342,01:19:24.343,Selfish.
01:19:24.426,01:19:27.596,Especially when that something is the Krabby Patty.
01:19:27.763,01:19:33.894,"Okay, everybody, let's get back Oh, no! I don't have the page!"
01:19:36.897,01:19:40.109,Don't worry. I thought of everything.
01:19:40.526,01:19:42.987,"All right, SpongeBob, take us home."
01:19:43.153,01:19:44.154,Thanks.
01:19:44.613,01:19:46.699,"-Squidward! -Oh, yeah."
01:19:46.782,01:19:50.077,"Come on, it's time to go back and open up The Krusty Krab!"
01:19:50.494,01:19:52.913,Are you out of your patty-flipping mind?
01:19:52.997,01:19:54.206,I'll never leave this place!
01:19:54.290,01:19:57.626,"I mean, look at me. I'm a god!"
01:19:57.710,01:20:00.212,"No, Squidward, you're a cashier."
01:20:01.755,01:20:04.925,Wait a minute! What? No!
01:20:08.304,01:20:11.140,"Well, it was fun while it lasted."
01:20:12.266,01:20:13.642,"Don't be sad, Squidward."
01:20:13.892,01:20:16.437,I left you a little surprise under your shirt!
01:20:20.691,01:20:24.403,"Aw, SpongeBob, you're okay in my book."
01:20:24.486,01:20:25.654,"Aw, shucks."
01:20:25.738,01:20:29.491,"Excuse us! We'd like 3,000 Krabby Patties, please!"
01:20:32.953,01:20:35.998,That sound must mean things are back to normal.
01:20:36.248,01:20:38.709,"Who wants 3,000 Krabby Patties?"
01:20:42.963,01:20:44.757,"First one's for you, Gary."
01:20:44.840,01:20:46.759,"Extra mayo, just the way you like it."
01:20:49.011,01:20:50.054,A-ha!
01:20:50.137,01:20:51.555,Caught you red-handed!
01:20:51.847,01:20:53.599,Gary hates mayo.
01:20:53.682,01:20:57.394,"Plankton! Up to your old tricks again already, eh?"
01:20:57.478,01:20:59.980,"Hey, I'm just putting things back the way they were."
01:21:00.064,01:21:01.857,"What do you have to say about this, Gary?"
01:21:11.158,01:21:13.702,"See you later, tee-am-mate!"
01:21:22.961,01:21:24.838,"Pwease, Mr. Piwate?"
01:21:25.506,01:21:27.132,"Oh, Kyle..."
01:21:28.759,01:21:31.011,How can I say no to you?
01:21:33.764,01:21:35.349,"Are you ready, kids?"
01:21:37.184,01:21:42.773,"Uh, what did you say? There's sand in my ears and I can't hear you!"
01:22:03.919,01:22:04.795,Ready?
01:22:13.637,01:22:15.931,"Oh, man. I like that song. What happened?"
01:22:16.014,01:22:18.267,I don't like that song and I put an end to it.
01:22:18.350,01:22:19.685,"Well, this music is terrible."
01:22:19.768,01:22:21.145,I suppose you're entitled to your...
01:22:21.228,01:22:22.521,Wait. Why am I talking to you?
01:23:04.313,01:23:06.815,"Here, knock it off! Yer making the movie too long!"
01:23:28.170,01:23:30.464,"That was pretty good, actually."
01:24:03.705,01:24:06.875,This dance is so last year.
01:24:33.569,01:24:34.945,You know what this needs?
01:24:35.320,01:24:38.407,A little interpretive dance!
