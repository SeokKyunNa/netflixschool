00:02:17.304,00:02:20.015,other hotels.
00:02:20.057,00:02:21.600,What is the problem here?
00:02:21.642,00:02:24.019,We made these reservations over six months ago.
00:02:24.061,00:02:26.605,"- I know, I'm just not seeing it."
00:02:26.647,00:02:29.149,- Lisa always takes care of us.
00:02:29.190,00:02:31.234,- Her grandmother passed away.
00:02:31.276,00:02:37.032,- Would you get in more trouble if you bothered her or if I called corporate?
00:02:37.074,00:02:39.367,OK.
00:02:43.455,00:02:46.083,- Who taught you how to drive?
00:02:46.125,00:02:49.128,- You'll catch your plane.
00:02:49.168,00:02:52.798,- Lisa Reisert.
00:02:52.840,00:02:56.384,"I'm so sorry to call, but I didn't know what to do. I have a situation."
00:02:56.426,00:02:59.638,- Slow down. What's the problem?
00:02:59.680,00:03:01.306,Yep. They're regulars.
00:03:01.348,00:03:04.309,"Yeah, well, I think I sort of erased their reservation."
00:03:04.351,00:03:06.311,I was never checked out on this new system.
00:03:06.353,00:03:10.149,Did I mention I had a confirmed reservation? This is my receipt.
00:03:10.189,00:03:12.359,I downloaded it off the Internet myself.
00:03:12.400,00:03:15.403,"- I know, Mrs. Taylor, calm down."
00:03:15.445,00:03:17.531,- Calm down?
00:03:17.572,00:03:21.702,Don't tell us to calm down.
00:03:21.743,00:03:24.830,- I'm so sorry. Lisa?
00:03:21.743,00:03:28.667,"- Cynthia, tell them one more minute, - they'll be happy, you promise."
00:03:28.709,00:03:30.460,- I promise.
00:03:30.502,00:03:33.755,"- Now, enter my PIN."
00:03:33.797,00:03:35.256,- Dad? Hold on.
00:03:35.298,00:03:37.051,- Can you hold on?
00:03:37.092,00:03:40.846,"- OK, it's 7-8-8-4-underscore-L-Reisert."
00:03:40.888,00:03:44.516,"- Lisa, I'm so sorry for calling."
00:03:44.558,00:03:46.476,- Are you logged in yet?
00:03:46.518,00:03:52.691,"OK. Click on the Crisis folder, you'll see a list of empty rooms, give 'em fourth-floor, comp 'em for tonight and tomorrow."
00:03:52.733,00:03:57.404,"OK, just a sec."
00:03:57.445,00:03:59.656,The first two nights are gonna be on us.
00:03:59.698,00:04:02.450,"And if you need anything else, just let me know."
00:04:02.492,00:04:04.327,We won't.
00:04:05.996,00:04:09.457,"God, they totally threw me."
00:04:09.499,00:04:12.419,"Cynthia, there are no assholes."
00:04:12.460,00:04:15.505,- Keep it. Anything else?
00:04:15.547,00:04:19.300,didn't get the California King they requested.
00:04:19.342,00:04:21.678,What else?
00:04:21.720,00:04:23.805,"- Oh, my God."
00:04:23.847,00:04:28.894,Security left a message saying the Charles Keefe party will be arriving at 5:30am instead of pm.
00:04:28.936,00:04:31.646,That's not that unusual.
00:04:31.688,00:04:35.483,"Make sure our guys have the entrance set, his security takes it from there."
00:04:35.525,00:04:37.819,Is Mr. Keefe Platinum Club or something or...?
00:04:37.861,00:04:39.863,Homeland Security.
00:04:39.905,00:04:45.827,Make sure there's a box of Montecristo Cubans in the room and a bottle of Cristal on ice. It's 3825.
00:04:45.869,00:04:48.622,- OK. Got it covered.
00:04:50.540,00:04:52.793,leaving on Flight 1387.
00:04:52.834,00:04:54.461,- Lisa Reisert.
00:04:54.502,00:04:55.837,I'm still here.
00:04:55.879,00:04:57.505,"Dad, I'm so sorry."
00:04:57.547,00:05:00.634,"- It's fine, sweetie."
00:05:00.675,00:05:04.096,Gearin' up for another sleepless night with a comedy marathon.
00:05:04.138,00:05:09.268,"Mmm. Before I forget, that book I gave you, you finish it yet?"
00:05:09.309,00:05:10.769,Uh... almost.
00:05:10.811,00:05:12.437,"You know, he's from Texas."
00:05:12.479,00:05:14.689,I didn't think shrinks came from there.
00:05:14.731,00:05:18.610,"Yeah, they do."
00:05:18.652,00:05:20.528,- How's the remodeling?
00:05:20.570,00:05:22.447,They made headway in the last few days.
00:05:22.489,00:05:25.117,"I lost my wallet, but that's par for the course."
00:05:25.159,00:05:27.953,- It's lookin' good.
00:05:27.995,00:05:32.749,You should. The upstairs hallway is totally unrecognizable.
00:05:32.791,00:05:35.376,- Your room hasn't been touched.
00:05:35.418,00:05:38.546,"Please, go nuts, make it into a gym or a putting green."
00:05:38.588,00:05:40.632,You know I can't do that.
00:05:40.674,00:05:44.427,You never know when you might just wanna spend a few nights back here.
00:05:44.469,00:05:48.556,You know? Make an escape from the day-to-day.
00:05:48.598,00:05:51.226,"Day-to-day, it's where I thrive. You know that."
00:05:52.686,00:05:54.729,Right.
00:05:55.480,00:06:01.528,"So, - how's your mom holdin' up?"
00:06:01.569,00:06:04.198,And you? What about you?
00:06:04.239,00:06:06.700,"- Yep, I'm fine."
00:06:07.659,00:06:09.286,"Everything's fine, Dad."
00:06:09.328,00:06:11.746,You're gonna have to start takin' my word for it.
00:06:11.788,00:06:13.748,"Look, I gotta go."
00:06:13.790,00:06:16.375,You sure you don't need a pickup?
00:06:16.417,00:06:20.130,- I thought you lost your wallet.
00:06:20.172,00:06:22.465,I'm taking the red-eye.
00:06:22.507,00:06:24.926,It's gonna be too late.
00:06:24.968,00:06:28.680,"- I love you too, sweetie."
00:06:32.142,00:06:35.520,We have a cancellation update.
00:06:35.562,00:06:40.317,- Flight 1192 to Pittsburg has been cancelled due to weather.
00:06:40.359,00:06:46.365,"on the flight to Atlanta that was canceled, come to the front of the line so we can reroute you."
00:06:46.405,00:06:48.575,to Miami...
00:06:49.910,00:06:52.120,- I'm sorry.
00:06:52.162,00:06:53.830,I'm wearing my combat boots.
00:06:55.249,00:06:57.918,- Excuse me?
00:06:57.959,00:06:59.418,Oh. Yeah.
00:06:59.460,00:07:02.630,Oh. I just love him.
00:07:02.672,00:07:05.508,How is that?
00:07:05.550,00:07:06.843,I'm not really sure.
00:07:06.885,00:07:09.346,He's so handsome.
00:07:09.388,00:07:12.307,I work during the day so I always miss his shows.
00:07:12.349,00:07:15.018,Cleveland has been delayed.
00:07:15.060,00:07:18.521,- Here. That'll catch you up.
00:07:18.563,00:07:21.900,"I'm finished. My dad's given me so many, I could start a library. Please."
00:07:21.942,00:07:25.486,- That's very nice of you.
00:07:21.942,00:07:31.826,"- Once again anyone who is scheduled on the flight to Atlanta, if you wanna get out of Dallas tonight, come to the front of the line at this time."
00:07:31.868,00:07:34.204,Excuse me.
00:07:31.868,00:07:37.332,"You're letting them go, but we've been standing here for an hour? How does that happen?"
00:07:37.374,00:07:39.542,"If we don't re-book, they miss their flight."
00:07:39.584,00:07:42.796,It doesn't matter that you canceled my first flight then rerouted me?
00:07:42.837,00:07:46.091,- I understand.
00:07:46.133,00:07:48.760,Don't make her do that.
00:07:48.802,00:07:52.555,I don't think I was talking to you - I realize that...
00:07:52.597,00:07:54.557,"Please, sir."
00:07:54.599,00:07:57.769,"Um, she is the one standing between us getting out and anarchy."
00:07:57.811,00:08:01.564,- But she's not the one in...
00:07:57.811,00:08:04.318,"- She's exhausted, worked 18 hours, and she suspects we all hate her just as much as you do."
00:08:04.359,00:08:11.491,What do you say we give her a break? Let her get back to a job I'm guessing is a lot more thankless than yours.
00:08:14.577,00:08:16.704,This airline sucks.
00:08:19.916,00:08:24.712,"- Next in line, please."
00:08:24.754,00:08:26.798,Oh! Here.
00:08:26.840,00:08:30.551,Oh. Thank you very much.
00:08:30.593,00:08:31.928,You're welcome.
00:08:31.970,00:08:34.639,Yeah. Thank you.
00:08:34.681,00:08:36.475,Not at all.
00:08:36.516,00:08:39.144,- You got the ball rolling.
00:08:39.186,00:08:41.521,"- Reflex, I guess."
00:08:41.562,00:08:45.317,I work in a hotel. I deal with people like that all the time.
00:08:45.359,00:08:48.569,Oh. Uh...
00:08:48.611,00:08:51.072,- The Lux Atlantic It's in...
00:08:51.114,00:08:52.991,- Right. I know it well.
00:08:53.033,00:08:56.744,- So you're on this...
00:08:56.786,00:08:59.539,- You?
00:08:59.580,00:09:03.001,But you know what? That's why God created the Tex-Mex.
00:09:03.043,00:09:07.214,The best nachos in the airport and right across from our gate.
00:09:07.255,00:09:09.924,Good tip. Thanks.
00:09:11.134,00:09:16.931,- Save you a seat.
00:09:16.973,00:09:20.519,"Yeah, that was..."
00:09:20.560,00:09:23.146,I didn't mean to invade your personal space or...
00:09:23.188,00:09:25.732,- No.
00:09:25.773,00:09:27.692,I just... I have a few calls to make.
00:09:27.734,00:09:29.903,Sure. I understand.

00:09:40.914,00:09:45.544,"- Well, my name's Mary, and I hear this is the first time you're flying by yourself."
00:09:45.585,00:09:48.296,"Well, you must be very brave."
00:09:48.338,00:09:50.131,- Are you gonna be OK?

00:10:07.065,00:10:09.650,- It's iced. Don't worry.

00:11:54.548,00:11:57.008,"- Uh, could I have a bay breeze?"
00:11:57.050,00:12:00.928,"Thanks. It's an impressive talent, though. Very close."

00:12:08.895,00:12:12.440,Fun for me is just getting off that plane in one piece.
00:12:12.482,00:12:15.943,- Oh. Fear of flying?
00:12:15.985,00:12:18.238,Were you in Texas on hotel business?
00:12:18.279,00:12:20.657,No. My grandmother died.
00:12:20.699,00:12:21.740,Oh.
00:12:21.782,00:12:24.661,It's OK. She was 91.

00:12:32.711,00:12:34.879,Excuse me?
00:12:34.921,00:12:43.346,"Yeah, she said the Grape-Nuts kept her arteries clean and Duke helped with the rest."
00:12:45.181,00:12:47.392,Wow. A dynamic woman.
00:12:47.434,00:12:52.439,"Nothing fazed her, you know?"
00:12:52.480,00:12:54.357,Always look forward.
00:12:54.399,00:12:55.816,That's what she'd say.
00:12:55.858,00:12:59.904,- There ya go.

00:13:08.204,00:13:13.627,"I say I'm fine, he says, Are you sure?"
00:13:13.668,00:13:16.630,"- OK, I believe you."
00:13:16.671,00:13:19.424,"- The name's Jackson, by the way."

00:13:21.551,00:13:26.347,"No, I haven't gone by Jack since I was ten years old."

00:13:33.480,00:13:34.981,- There you go.
00:13:35.022,00:13:37.609,- That wasn't nice of your parents.
00:13:37.651,00:13:40.654,That's what I told 'em before I killed 'em.
00:13:43.448,00:13:47.034,"Well, if it's any comfort, my middle name's Henrietta."
00:13:47.076,00:13:48.286,Henrietta.
00:13:48.328,00:13:51.539,"But that's my grandma's name, though."
00:13:51.998,00:13:54.125,Was.
00:13:54.167,00:13:58.254,"Well, here's to Henrietta, whose spirit is very much alive."
00:14:13.019,00:14:13.978,What?

You may recall that four months ago, Keefe sent shockwaves through the department after he made remarks during his first press conference."
00:14:38.753,00:14:40.714,"I don't discriminate, I communicate."
00:14:40.755,00:14:42.799,Just not always with a kind word.
00:14:42.841,00:14:45.885,"Now, don't get me wrong, I believe in diplomacy."
00:14:45.926,00:14:51.850,It can work.
00:14:51.891,00:14:56.646,Do I have your attention?

00:16:40.166,00:16:49.592,"Once we've reached cruising altitude and the captain turns off the fasten seat belt sign, we will be offering our beverage service with complimentary soft drinks, juice and coffee."
00:16:49.634,00:16:52.219,- I'll help.
00:16:52.261,00:16:54.138,Thank you.
00:16:55.765,00:16:57.433,- Oh!
00:16:57.475,00:16:59.226,Hi.
00:16:59.268,00:17:01.103,Again.
00:17:01.145,00:17:03.731,- I figured you'd be in first class.
00:17:03.773,00:17:06.150,"- I'm all coach, all the time."
00:17:06.192,00:17:10.864,Yeah. I think that's my seat.
00:17:10.905,00:17:13.574,"- What, you're not sitting here."
00:17:13.616,00:17:16.118,- That says 18-G?
00:17:16.160,00:17:19.497,You're not kidding.
00:17:19.539,00:17:23.042,"- No, no, no. That's OK."
00:17:23.501,00:17:24.585,Oh!
00:17:24.627,00:17:26.253,- You OK?
00:17:26.295,00:17:27.881,- You sure? OK.
00:17:27.922,00:17:30.591,I'm not normally such a lightweight.
00:17:31.592,00:17:33.803,Those were strong bay breezes.
00:17:33.845,00:17:36.973,"Well, I'm cutting you off anyways, all right?"
00:17:41.227,00:17:43.897,"So... What are the odds, huh?"
00:17:43.938,00:17:46.733,"Yeah, I know."
00:17:47.901,00:17:49.610,Wait a minute.
00:17:49.652,00:17:52.238,"You're not stalking me, are you?"
00:17:53.614,00:17:54.782,No.
00:18:00.038,00:18:02.456,- You got me.
00:18:04.876,00:18:06.794,"- Oh, jeez."
00:18:06.836,00:18:09.881,"If I say yes, are you gonna ask me if I'm sure?"
00:18:09.923,00:18:13.175,No. No. That's your dad's department.
00:18:13.968,00:18:15.511,"Yeah, I'm fine. I..."
00:18:15.553,00:18:21.308,"Earlier today I had some cheap wine at the funeral, and combined with the cheap vodka..."
00:18:21.350,00:18:24.520,- I see.
00:18:24.562,00:18:27.481,"- Well, I feel terrible now."
00:18:27.523,00:18:29.025,"Oh, I do."
00:18:29.067,00:18:35.448,"it's been a long night, so stow your belongings and take your seats as quickly as possible, we'll be under way. Thank you."
00:18:35.489,00:18:38.910,- I think somebody needs a bellhop.
00:18:38.952,00:18:41.370,OK.
00:18:44.290,00:18:46.250,Let me.
00:18:46.292,00:18:48.878,- Thank you so much.
00:18:48.920,00:18:54.174,- Just when I thought there weren't any gentlemen left.
00:18:54.216,00:18:56.010,You have a pleasant flight.
00:18:56.469,00:18:59.179,"Oh, my."
00:18:59.221,00:19:01.474,I'm already in chapter two.
00:19:01.515,00:19:02.850,"Oh, great."
00:19:03.726,00:19:05.103,Um...
00:19:05.144,00:19:07.354,I gave her this book earlier.
00:19:07.396,00:19:09.857,She's a huge Dr. Phil fan.
00:19:09.899,00:19:12.568,"Oh, I saw that."
00:19:12.610,00:19:14.320,"Well, that's me."
00:19:14.361,00:19:15.947,"People-pleaser, 24-7."
00:19:17.490,00:19:19.700,"- Well, you are popular."
00:19:19.742,00:19:23.329,"- No, it's OK. No."
00:19:23.370,00:19:24.664,Go ahead.
00:19:24.705,00:19:26.332,Hey. What's up?
00:19:27.374,00:19:29.418,"Yeah. No, it's OK."
00:19:29.460,00:19:32.421,So it's definitely happening? Uh-huh.
00:19:32.463,00:19:34.924,"5:30. OK, done deal."
00:19:36.717,00:19:40.805,Work. For the last time.
00:19:40.847,00:19:43.016,"- Goodbye, Joe."
00:19:51.732,00:19:54.735,- Thank you.
00:19:56.654,00:20:05.997,"we'd like to ask that you discontinue the use of any electronic devices, pagers, cell phones, laptops, anything with a switch should now be in the off position."
00:20:06.039,00:20:08.958,The use of cell phones is not allowed during the flight.
00:20:09.000,00:20:16.215,A list of devices suitable for use can be found on the cover - of your Fresh Air magazine.
00:20:28.519,00:20:31.898,looks like we're the red-eye to Miami.
00:20:31.939,00:20:37.444,"Welcome. The weather conditions may cause a bumpy takeoff, but don't worry, we'll soon climb above it."
00:20:37.486,00:20:40.614,We'll see if we can't make up lost time once we're in the air.
00:20:40.656,00:20:44.994,We're number one for departure.
00:20:45.036,00:20:49.874,"Ladies and gentlemen, we've been cleared for takeoff."
00:21:07.225,00:21:10.019,- We're not gonna make it.
00:21:11.437,00:21:13.814,I will punch you in your face. Shut up.
00:21:38.547,00:21:40.674,Are we there yet?
00:21:40.716,00:21:45.554,"So, uh, was Henrietta your mom's mom or your dad's mom?"
00:21:47.681,00:21:51.018,Um... My mom's. My dad's...
00:21:51.685,00:21:54.147,Mmm.
00:21:54.188,00:21:57.024,My dad's died a long time ago.
00:21:57.066,00:22:00.278,- Are your folks still together?
00:22:00.319,00:22:03.489,"They divorced three years ago, uh, married for 32."
00:22:03.530,00:22:07.160,- Oh.
00:22:07.201,00:22:10.788,That's a shame.
00:22:10.830,00:22:13.540,Mom moved back to Texas and Dad stayed in Miami.
00:22:13.582,00:22:15.918,I see. And does Dad still work?
00:22:15.960,00:22:18.796,Yeah. No! He's recently retired.
00:22:18.838,00:22:21.715,He's got a lot of time on his hands so he makes phone calls.
00:22:21.757,00:22:24.135,OK. He's filling all his work time with...
00:22:24.177,00:22:25.886,Worry time.
00:22:25.928,00:22:28.931,Does he have reason to worry about you?
00:22:30.683,00:22:38.774,"Well, even if he does, I mean, he's just gotta get used to the fact that life changes and sometimes things happen."
00:22:38.816,00:22:40.651,I know what you mean.
00:22:40.693,00:22:51.037,"Usually when things are going perfectly, you're back on track, everything's going to plan, and then one day, outta nowhere, somebody forgets to bolt the engine to the wing."
00:22:51.078,00:22:53.371,Yeah.
00:22:53.413,00:22:56.792,"We're through the worst of it, so you can relax."
00:22:56.834,00:23:01.839,"Keep your seat belt fastened while seated, as we may hit more turbulence."
00:23:01.881,00:23:06.135,- Thanks for distracting me.
00:23:06.177,00:23:07.928,What are you doing?
00:23:07.970,00:23:10.848,Just keeping the focus on you and your father.
00:23:11.849,00:23:13.059,Why?
00:23:13.100,00:23:14.810,Part of my job.
00:23:15.978,00:23:17.563,Are you a shrink?
00:23:18.689,00:23:20.816,No. Manager.
00:23:21.984,00:23:24.070,- Better not say of a hotel.
00:23:24.111,00:23:27.614,- That would...
00:23:31.244,00:23:33.579,"- So, what do you do?"
00:23:31.244,00:23:37.041,"- Government overthrows, flashy high-profile assassinations. The usual."
00:23:39.543,00:23:43.756,- You're a spy.
00:23:43.797,00:23:46.967,- A hit man.
00:23:47.009,00:23:49.220,Right.
00:23:49.262,00:23:51.389,"Well, if I did, I couldn't say, could I?"
00:23:51.429,00:23:53.640,"- But, no."
00:23:53.682,00:23:55.642,The money's shit.
00:23:58.271,00:24:00.314,"OK, well, that's kinda weird."
00:24:00.356,00:24:03.317,- Why don't you tell me what you do?
00:24:06.195,00:24:09.282,"OK. OK, I'm sorry, I..."
00:24:09.323,00:24:12.952,"It's... Whatever you do, that's your own business."
00:24:12.993,00:24:15.079,Just as long as you're not...
00:24:15.121,00:24:17.331,What?
00:24:17.373,00:24:19.499,Hijacking the plane.
00:24:19.541,00:24:22.128,Oh. No.
00:24:22.169,00:24:24.671,That's good.
00:24:24.713,00:24:27.300,You're right. Most days it is my own business.
00:24:27.341,00:24:32.179,"But right now, as fate would have it, my business is all about you."
00:24:33.513,00:24:36.309,"- I'm sorry, about me?"
00:24:36.350,00:24:39.895,"OK, I'm not sure where you're going with this."
00:24:39.937,00:24:43.857,Charles Keefe. One of your regular VIPs. Ring a bell?
00:24:46.193,00:24:48.404,"- No, should it?"
00:24:48.446,00:24:51.740,He's on his way to your hotel and that's why you need to listen.
00:24:51.782,00:24:53.284,"No. No, I don't think..."
00:24:53.326,00:24:55.286,- I don't have to do that.
00:24:53.326,00:24:57.455,"- Yes, you do, if you want your dad to live."
00:24:59.457,00:25:01.750,- What did you say?
00:25:05.879,00:25:07.214,Yeah.
00:25:07.256,00:25:09.883,- Suit yourself.
00:25:09.925,00:25:12.011,You might wanna take a look at this.
00:25:13.595,00:25:17.308,JR. Joe Reisert.
00:25:17.350,00:25:20.060,- Where did you get that?
00:25:20.102,00:25:22.813,My associate grabbed it off your dad's desk.
00:25:22.855,00:25:26.317,Apparently next to your graduation picture.
00:25:26.359,00:25:28.402,JR.
00:25:28.444,00:25:30.070,His initials.
00:25:30.112,00:25:33.157,Jack Rippner.
00:25:33.199,00:25:42.582,"For some reason, Stewardess, this emotionally unstable, inebriated girl, whom I've never met before tonight, suddenly went crazy when I took it out of my pocket."
00:25:42.624,00:25:46.920,You tell the flight attendant and your dad dies.
00:25:51.217,00:25:53.260,Sit down.
00:26:03.020,00:26:04.938,You might wanna buckle up.
00:26:13.571,00:26:16.992,- Any luck?
00:26:17.034,00:26:20.079,18-G's flashing.
00:26:20.120,00:26:23.581,I'll take care of it.
00:26:23.623,00:26:25.834,Maybe I'll join her.
00:26:33.509,00:26:35.219,- Hi.
00:26:35.261,00:26:37.263,- What can I do for ya?
00:26:35.261,00:26:40.307,"- Leese, did you need another pillow or anything?"
00:26:41.392,00:26:43.769,"No, I don't need anything."
00:26:43.810,00:26:46.272,She's just had a really rough day.
00:26:46.313,00:26:47.565,A death in the family.
00:26:47.647,00:26:51.193,- Oh. I'm so sorry.
00:26:51.235,00:26:54.321,- I'll get you water and some tissues.
00:26:54.363,00:26:57.950,- Be right back.
00:26:57.991,00:27:01.412,"That was great, Leese."
00:27:01.454,00:27:04.998,"Just bottle the emotions a little more, OK?"
00:27:06.792,00:27:08.710,Have you done something to my father?
00:27:08.752,00:27:13.132,No. And it'll stay that way as long as you keep playing along.
00:27:16.218,00:27:17.677,What do you want from me?
00:27:17.719,00:27:20.013,"Now, I wanna wait for your Kleenex and water."
00:27:20.055,00:27:23.683,"And once we have our privacy, we can get back to business."
00:27:23.725,00:27:25.519,- Here you go.
00:27:25.561,00:27:29.022,"- Sure. Feel better, hon."
00:27:41.952,00:27:43.787,I need you to call your hotel.
00:27:43.829,00:27:46.957,It's very simple.
00:27:43.829,00:27:51.044,Just use your managerial pull to move Keefe from 3825 to suite 4080.
00:27:51.086,00:27:54.173,I'll leave the details to you. You just sell it.
00:27:54.214,00:27:59.136,You've got the wrong person. I don't have the authority to do that.
00:27:59.178,00:28:00.720,"Well, I happen to know that you do."
00:28:00.762,00:28:05.559,You're the only voice that can get this done by the time I need it done.
00:28:08.228,00:28:11.982,- You need me to write it down?
00:28:12.024,00:28:14.443,"Well, then what's the delay?"
00:28:18.113,00:28:21.908,"So by changing Keefe's room, does that make it easier?"
00:28:24.453,00:28:32.503,"Lisa, whatever female-driven, emotion-based dilemma you're dealing with right now, you have my sympathy."
00:28:32.545,00:28:38.676,"But for the sake of time and sanity, let's break this down into a little male-driven, fact-based logic."
00:28:38.717,00:28:42.471,One simple phone call saves your dad's life.
00:28:42.513,00:28:44.764,And it has to be made soon.
00:28:48.060,00:28:50.020,"You're gonna kill Keefe, aren't you?"
00:28:50.062,00:28:53.566,"You really need to start worrying more about your dad, Leese."
00:28:53.607,00:28:57.194,How am I supposed to know if he's OK? How do I know you haven't hurt him?
00:28:57.236,00:28:59.363,- He's fine.
00:28:59.405,00:29:05.369,The last call I got said he was sitting in the TV room eating leftover lasagna and watching the comedy marathon.
00:29:05.411,00:29:13.627,"Relax, Leese. By now my guy is probably back in his silver Beemer, parked outside 9321 Blossom Palms Lane."
00:29:13.669,00:29:20.759,"He's sitting in the dark, listening to a little smooth jazz, while he sharpens his 12-inch KA-BAR."
00:29:21.510,00:29:23.803,"That's a knife, Leese."
00:29:30.269,00:29:33.439,- I wanna talk to my dad.
00:29:33.480,00:29:37.359,No. I wanna know he's OK right now or I don't call anybody.
00:29:42.030,00:29:43.823,Your dime.
00:29:45.534,00:29:49.663,Credit card?
00:29:49.705,00:29:53.917,the captain has turned off the fasten seat belt sign.
00:29:53.959,00:29:56.336,You're free to move about the cabin.
00:30:23.029,00:30:28.994,of the comedy marathon following these messages.
00:30:34.708,00:30:36.376,"I'm comin', I'm comin'!"
00:30:37.461,00:30:39.129,God.
00:30:40.380,00:30:42.174,- Hello?
00:30:42.215,00:30:46.595,Leese? Are you already home?
00:30:46.637,00:30:48.930,"No, I'm on the air phone on the plane."
00:30:48.972,00:30:50.516,We were late taking off and...
00:30:50.557,00:30:54.687,"Honey, I know you don't like it when I ask, but are you all right?"
00:30:54.728,00:30:56.730,You sound upset.
00:30:59.274,00:31:01.276,Leese?
00:31:01.318,00:31:03.487,Leese? Are you still there?
00:31:07.324,00:31:09.785,Did he sound healthy to you?
00:31:09.827,00:31:12.663,"I hope that's a yes, because that's the best I can do."
00:31:12.705,00:31:15.957,Now let's get this over with.
00:31:15.999,00:31:19.586,Excuse me. I'm sorry.
00:31:19.628,00:31:22.506,"Last time, I promise."
00:31:22.548,00:31:24.174,Sure.
00:31:31.557,00:31:33.099,Don't get cute.
00:31:44.944,00:31:47.447,"- Hello, again."
00:31:47.489,00:31:50.659,"You know, I didn't think that this book would be so much work."
00:31:50.701,00:31:54.954,There's all these surveys about yourself before you can go on to the rest...
00:31:54.996,00:31:57.040,Could you wait one second?
00:31:57.082,00:31:59.793,- Sure.
00:31:59.835,00:32:02.421,Know what? Don't worry about the surveys. I'll just...
00:32:02.462,00:32:06.132,- I'll just highlight my favorite part.
00:32:06.174,00:32:07.801,- Got it.
00:32:09.720,00:32:13.139,Would you gimme your address too? I wanna return the favor.
00:32:13.181,00:32:15.809,my nails on these things.
00:32:15.851,00:32:18.562,I'm gonna need you to help me put it back up.
00:32:18.604,00:32:22.649,- We're on a collision course.
00:32:24.276,00:32:26.653,- I'll come back for that later.
00:32:26.695,00:32:28.530,- Thank you.
00:32:28.572,00:32:30.156,OK.
00:32:30.198,00:32:34.119,- Sorry I'm...
00:32:34.160,00:32:36.204,"- Excuse us, ma'am."
00:32:36.246,00:32:37.997,Thank you.
00:32:43.420,00:32:46.465,They're much pushier these days.
00:32:48.759,00:32:52.345,I didn't want this to get complicated.
00:32:53.972,00:32:56.057,I have to assume she's gonna read that.
00:32:56.099,00:32:58.143,Read what?
00:33:19.080,00:33:22.125,- How's she doin'?
00:33:22.167,00:33:24.544,- Good.
00:33:50.278,00:33:52.739,Would you like a blanket?
00:33:58.119,00:34:01.957,Would you like a blanket?
00:34:27.024,00:34:30.109,to your seats. Thank you.
00:34:31.653,00:34:34.614,I want you to get excited about your life.
00:34:34.656,00:34:36.700,But you gotta get real.
00:34:36.742,00:34:43.957,"I'm challenging you, starting now, to stop dealing in opinions and assumptions and start dealing in facts."
00:34:43.999,00:34:47.377,Fact: Fearing to act is human.
00:34:47.419,00:34:50.005,Failing to act is just plain dumb.
00:34:50.047,00:34:55.552,Fact: Thinking when you should be acting will only make your head hurt.
00:34:55.594,00:34:58.638,"I'm not makin' this up, Leese."
00:34:58.680,00:35:04.853,Fact: You've been out for a half an hour and Keefe's room still hasn't been changed.
00:35:04.895,00:35:07.647,So I got you some aspirin.
00:35:08.648,00:35:11.109,"I need you coherent, Leese."
00:35:13.152,00:35:19.659,"hoping things would calm down, but that's not happening."
00:35:19.701,00:35:23.080,"Let's see if we can't get above this weather, smooth things out."
00:35:23.121,00:35:26.541,"Now, let's do this."
00:35:31.004,00:35:37.677,"If I do it, if I make that call, do you promise you'll tell who's outside my dad's house to go away?"
00:35:37.719,00:35:44.392,"You call, I call, Dad wakes up, puts on coffee, never suspects a thing, you go back to work, life goes on."
00:35:48.480,00:35:51.858,I am now calling your hotel.
00:35:53.318,00:35:55.528,I don't have to tell you to sound convincing.
00:35:55.570,00:35:57.781,- You've said enough.
00:36:01.326,00:36:04.871,"Lux Atlantic Resort, this is Cynthia."
00:36:04.913,00:36:07.749,Hello? Hello?
00:36:07.791,00:36:09.417,"Cynthia, it's Lisa."
00:36:09.459,00:36:12.253,terrible. Are you OK?
00:36:12.295,00:36:15.966,There's just... There's a lot of turbulence on the plane.
00:36:16.008,00:36:18.093,- You're still on the plane?
00:36:18.135,00:36:19.886,I heard flights are delayed.
00:36:19.928,00:36:22.388,You'd be so proud of me.
00:36:22.430,00:36:26.018,"Cristal on ice, the cigars, not easy to find this time of night."
00:36:26.059,00:36:29.354,"You know, about that. I'm gonna need you to do me a favor, OK?"
00:36:29.395,00:36:31.023,You sure you're OK?
00:36:31.064,00:36:33.232,Please do not ask me again if I'm OK.
00:36:33.274,00:36:35.652,- I hope you're...
00:36:40.949,00:36:44.410,"Look, uh, something's come up."
00:36:44.452,00:36:46.955,We gotta change Keefe's room.
00:36:46.997,00:36:49.041,Can you pull up the file?
00:36:51.043,00:36:54.921,We're gonna move him to room 4080. Right.
00:36:54.963,00:36:56.882,The PIN is 4882.
00:36:56.923,00:37:00.010,- I'm gonna need you to take...
00:37:00.052,00:37:02.387,Hello? Cynthia?
00:37:07.017,00:37:09.435,"Pretty clear thinking, given the circumstances."
00:37:09.477,00:37:11.897,"Let me guess, stress management courses?"
00:37:11.938,00:37:15.650,They're really paying off.
00:37:15.692,00:37:18.028,"- Excuse me, miss."
00:37:18.070,00:37:21.364,- Are the phones not working?
00:37:21.406,00:37:23.616,They'll come back when we find clear air.
00:37:23.658,00:37:26.995,- Great. Thank you.
00:37:28.705,00:37:31.791,- Why are you doing this here?
00:37:31.833,00:37:37.964,"She keeled over, you hopped on the next flight, - Keefe changed plans, here we are."
00:37:38.006,00:37:39.758,"- Peanuts, thank you."
00:37:39.799,00:37:41.927,No.
00:37:41.968,00:37:45.805,"So, what happens if they don't start working?"
00:37:45.847,00:37:48.767,You bury your dad in a closed casket.
00:38:02.655,00:38:07.577,"yourselves, 'cause I have news."
00:39:04.926,00:39:06.052,I know him.
00:39:06.094,00:39:09.264,- Know who?
00:39:09.306,00:39:11.683,He's a really decent man.
00:39:11.724,00:39:14.811,"Well, sometimes bad things happen to good people."
00:39:14.853,00:39:16.938,Like you.
00:39:18.898,00:39:21.318,"You know, I've known you for a while now, Lisa."
00:39:21.359,00:39:23.028,"Before tonight, I mean."
00:39:23.069,00:39:25.905,"And far as I can tell, your life revolves around your job."
00:39:25.947,00:39:33.746,"The occasional cocktail at the corner cafe, the classic late-night movies."
00:39:33.788,00:39:35.665,What turned you into such a loner?
00:39:35.707,00:39:39.627,Was it your parents' divorce?
00:39:39.669,00:39:42.755,"Wait, did someone break your heart?"
00:39:48.427,00:39:51.514,has turned off the fasten seat belt sign.
00:39:51.556,00:39:55.227,- I have to go to the restroom.
00:39:56.019,00:39:58.063,Best I can do.
00:39:59.397,00:40:01.691,"OK, you know what?"
00:40:01.733,00:40:05.528,I'm gonna make that call when I can make the call.
00:40:05.570,00:40:08.073,But right now you gotta let me go.
00:40:09.407,00:40:11.409,I need to go.
00:40:11.450,00:40:14.829,OK. I trust you.
00:40:16.122,00:40:17.957,And I need my purse.
00:40:17.999,00:40:20.252,But not that much.
00:40:27.300,00:40:29.635,there for a minute.
00:40:29.677,00:40:31.971,goin' in and out.
00:40:50.865,00:40:52.491,Excuse me.
00:40:59.707,00:41:01.000,You in line?
00:41:02.835,00:41:05.046,Yeah. Do you wanna...?
00:41:05.088,00:41:06.672,You were here first.
00:41:09.175,00:41:10.969,Excuse me.
00:41:45.920,00:41:48.298,"Oh, God."
00:41:56.014,00:41:58.975,OK. Get up.
00:42:38.723,00:42:40.058,I was wondering...
00:42:48.607,00:42:49.526,Don't fight me.
00:42:49.567,00:42:52.945,You're all worked up from being so creative. Breathe.
00:42:52.987,00:42:55.240,"Hey, Rebecca."
00:42:55.281,00:42:57.450,You can't just run off like that.
00:42:57.492,00:42:59.244,A man went in there.
00:42:59.285,00:43:02.455,Everyone shares. I'll take you to the one close to your seat.
00:43:02.497,00:43:05.458,But a lady's in there too.
00:43:05.500,00:43:08.294,"OK, one of those flights."
00:43:09.879,00:43:12.215,"Please, just stop whoever's at my dad's house."
00:43:12.257,00:43:16.886,"I already have, by twice intercepting these little communiqués."
00:43:16.928,00:43:23.226,"If they'd have fallen into the hands of a stewardess, she'd have gone to the cockpit and we'd land somewhere else."
00:43:23.268,00:43:30.066,"If that happens, Leese, our guy in the BMW's gonna know about it."
00:43:25.853,00:43:33.570,So do Dad a favor and stop gambling with his life.
00:43:39.951,00:43:44.205,You don't have to do this.
00:43:54.215,00:43:56.175,Someone do that to you?
00:43:57.218,00:43:59.011,No.
00:44:00.096,00:44:02.265,Is that what it is?
00:44:04.183,00:44:06.644,No.
00:44:06.685,00:44:08.062,You know what I think?
00:44:09.522,00:44:10.856,You know what I think?
00:44:10.898,00:44:13.943,I think you're not such an honest person.
00:44:13.985,00:44:21.493,Because I've followed you for eight weeks now and I never once saw you order anything but a fucking sea breeze.
00:44:21.534,00:44:24.537,I can't breathe.
00:44:29.542,00:44:31.628,"I never lied to you, Leese."
00:44:31.669,00:44:34.755,Know why?
00:44:34.797,00:44:39.885,We're both professional. We have the will and the means to follow through.
00:44:37.509,00:44:42.388,"'Cause when we don't, our customers aren't happy."
00:44:39.927,00:44:45.350,"And when they're not, we suffer and our lives go to shit."
00:44:46.351,00:44:48.936,And that's not going to happen.
00:44:48.978,00:44:50.855,Is it?
00:44:52.398,00:44:55.276,- No.
00:44:55.318,00:44:58.655,Because I'm gonna tell you the phones are working again.
00:44:58.695,00:45:02.116,Are you sure we got a deal this time?
00:45:02.158,00:45:05.620,- Huh?
00:45:06.287,00:45:08.498,Peachy.
00:45:11.042,00:45:13.752,"Well, thanks for the quickie."
00:45:14.795,00:45:16.589,Good.
00:45:18.257,00:45:19.884,Come on.
00:45:22.845,00:45:24.305,Excuse me.
00:45:27.766,00:45:30.353,This isn't a motel.
00:45:30.395,00:45:32.063,Sure.
00:45:34.857,00:45:38.277,- Lose something?
00:45:38.319,00:45:43.824,slipped down behind your...
00:45:43.866,00:45:46.285,"I need you to pull yourself together, Lisa."
00:45:46.327,00:45:49.372,We seem to have attracted a little attention.
00:45:49.414,00:45:53.418,"Once they've made their rounds, we'll make the call."
00:45:53.459,00:45:56.462,has turned on the fasten seat belt sign.
00:45:56.504,00:46:00.425,Please return to your seats as soon as possible. Thank you.
00:46:14.397,00:46:17.567,"Yo. You steal my pen, jackass?"
00:46:17.609,00:46:20.403,"No, man, cut it out."
00:46:25.450,00:46:28.494,Mr. Keefe has a 7am breakfast and the meeting's at 8am sharp.
00:46:28.536,00:46:31.456,We're out by 9:15.
00:46:31.497,00:46:33.332,Cars are en route and on time.
00:46:33.374,00:46:36.043,"Armored Escalades, full communication package."
00:46:36.085,00:46:39.130,- Thanks. We're all set.
00:46:39.171,00:46:40.797,- You got it.
00:46:40.839,00:46:43.259,Daddy's working.
00:46:43.301,00:46:45.386,"Come here, you."
00:46:47.305,00:46:50.475,till wheels down.
00:47:11.329,00:47:13.247,Trash?
00:47:33.976,00:47:35.353,It's time.

00:48:02.213,00:48:04.841,"- Cynthia, it's Lisa."
00:48:04.881,00:48:07.176,So I guess you still need that favor.
00:48:07.218,00:48:11.305,Yeah. I was checking with Dan Young from Maintenance.
00:48:11.347,00:48:14.851,- We can't put Keefe in that room.
00:48:14.891,00:48:23.401,I know. But they were fixing a water valve in the master bath and they didn't fix the right one so if anyone uses the plumbing...
00:48:23.442,00:48:25.653,- The shit'll hit the fan.
00:48:25.695,00:48:28.823,So where do we move him to?
00:48:30.991,00:48:33.786,Lisa? You still there?
00:48:33.828,00:48:35.788,4080.
00:48:36.831,00:48:39.709,4080. OK.
00:48:39.751,00:48:42.378,- His security people will be...?
00:48:42.420,00:48:45.089,"They're not gonna be happy, so just..."
00:48:45.130,00:48:49.093,- Just tell them I authorized it.
00:48:49.134,00:48:53.389,"The cigars, the Cristal. There's hardly time, Leese. I better go."

00:49:23.001,00:49:26.004,Make the call.
00:49:30.885,00:49:33.763,- I still need you.
00:49:33.805,00:49:38.434,"I'll keep that. As soon as we're on the ground, I'll get confirmation Keefe has been handled."
00:49:38.476,00:49:44.732,"While you wait, what if your guy decides to kill my dad - because you didn't make the call?"
00:49:41.938,00:49:51.029,- He doesn't move unless I say so.
00:49:51.071,00:49:54.283,It'll all be over soon.

00:50:00.247,00:50:01.833,His family's with him?
00:50:02.999,00:50:04.710,You're gonna kill his family too?
00:50:04.752,00:50:11.175,"Somebody wants to send a big brash message, that's their business."
00:50:11.216,00:50:13.469,"I do my part, move on."
00:50:20.559,00:50:22.227,"Oh, my God."
00:50:23.145,00:50:25.147,"Lisa, shh."

01:12:45.069,01:12:47.738,It says you had someone hit in front of your house.
01:12:47.780,01:12:50.700,There is a man in my house who's trying to kill me.
01:12:50.741,01:12:53.619,"OK, if you can, lock yourself in a room immediately."
01:12:53.661,01:12:54.954,Units are on the way.
01:12:54.996,01:12:56.831,Just hurry.
01:13:26.652,01:13:28.445,No!

01:14:38.975,01:14:42.770,"Come on, sweetheart."
01:15:09.672,01:15:11.715,- Right over there. Right there.
01:15:11.757,01:15:14.510,what's your 20?
01:15:14.551,01:15:15.845,Cynthia.
01:15:15.886,01:15:17.930,- We got it covered.
01:15:17.972,01:15:19.432,"- Yeah, I'm..."

01:15:21.225,01:15:23.894,"...I think we had a really good night, all things considered."
01:15:23.936,01:15:25.646,"Just that one incident, really."
01:15:25.688,01:15:28.316,"Cynthia, you did so good."
01:15:28.358,01:15:30.818,- Thank you.
01:15:32.236,01:15:34.238,Excuse me. Ladies.

01:15:41.287,01:15:44.165,"- Let's talk soon, yes?"
01:15:46.959,01:15:49.462,This is the worst experience we have ever had.
01:15:49.504,01:15:51.714,Do you have any idea what we have been through?
01:15:51.755,01:15:54.675,- Well...
01:15:54.717,01:15:59.055,"Then, our ceiling exploded."
01:15:59.096,01:16:01.265,I could get asthma.
01:16:01.307,01:16:04.685,I'm so sorry. Is there anything we can do to make it up to you?
01:16:04.727,01:16:07.021,Yes.
01:16:07.063,01:16:10.941,Get rid of her.
01:16:10.983,01:16:14.195,Absolutely. And cheeky too.
01:16:14.237,01:16:17.156,I see. Well...
01:16:19.367,01:16:22.786,Here's what you can do.
01:16:22.828,01:16:26.499,A comment card? She asked us to fill out a comment card.
01:16:26.541,01:16:28.709,You want us to fill out a comment card?
01:16:28.751,01:16:33.506,"Yes, I do. And after you finish, you can go ahead and just shove it up your ass."
01:16:36.133,01:16:39.595,Yeah.
01:16:39.636,01:16:41.764,- You are so my hero.
01:16:41.805,01:16:43.891,- Let's open the bar.
01:16:43.933,01:16:46.977,"- Oh, anything but a bay breeze."
