00:00:42.125,00:00:44.169,"I mean, look at this."
00:00:44.335,00:00:46.379,-You got aliens. MASON: Mm.
00:00:46.546,00:00:49.799,You got big green guys tearing down buildings.
00:00:49.966,00:00:52.844,"When I was a kid, I used to draw cowboys and Indians."
00:00:53.011,00:00:56.973,"Um, actually, it's Native American, but whatever."
00:00:57.515,00:00:59.934,"Yeah. Tell you what, though."
00:01:00.560,00:01:02.520,"It ain't bad, is it?"
00:01:03.063,00:01:04.439,No. Yeah.
00:01:04.606,00:01:06.483,Kid's got a future.
00:01:06.649,00:01:08.443,"Yeah, well..."
00:01:09.277,00:01:10.737,"...we'll see, I guess."
00:01:35.386,00:01:37.347,"No, hey! Uh-uh!"
00:01:37.514,00:01:39.098,You can't saw through that stuff.
00:01:40.058,00:01:42.101,These alien bastards are tough.
00:01:42.268,00:01:44.229,You gotta use the stuff they use.
00:01:46.731,00:01:49.234,-See? All right. SCHULTZ: All right.
00:01:50.860,00:01:52.737,"Oh, hey!"

00:01:55.365,00:01:57.617,"-Yeah. My alarm didn't go off. -Yeah, your alarm."
00:01:57.784,00:02:00.495,"Look, just go stack that armor plating like I asked you."
00:02:00.662,00:02:02.455,This is a huge deal for us.
00:02:02.622,00:02:04.082,"HOAG: Attention, please!"
00:02:04.249,00:02:07.085,In accordance with Executive Order 396B...
00:02:07.252,00:02:10.797,...all post-battle cleanup operations are now under our jurisdiction.
00:02:10.964,00:02:13.049,Thank you for your service. We'll take it from here.
00:02:13.216,00:02:14.509,Who the hell are you?
00:02:14.676,00:02:16.136,Qualified personnel.
00:02:16.302,00:02:25.395,"Look, I have a city contract to salvage all this, okay, with the city, so-- I apologize, Mr. Toomes, but all salvage operations are now under our jurisdiction."
00:02:25.562,00:02:28.857,Please turn over any and all exotic materials that you've collected...
00:02:29.023,00:02:30.358,...or you will be prosecuted.
00:02:30.733,00:02:32.485,"Ma'am, what am--?"
00:02:32.652,00:02:35.530,"Please. Come here. Hey, lady, come on."
00:02:35.697,00:02:37.282,Look...
00:02:40.118,00:02:41.494,I brought in a whole new crew.
00:02:41.661,00:02:44.164,These guys have a family. I have a family.
00:02:44.330,00:02:46.457,I'm all in on this. I could lose my house.
00:02:46.624,00:02:49.961,"I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do."
00:02:50.128,00:02:52.255,"Maybe next time, don't overextend yourself."
00:02:57.719,00:02:59.012,Yeah.
00:02:59.178,00:03:01.806,He's right. I overextended myself.
00:03:01.973,00:03:02.974,"MAN 1: Unh! MAN 2: Hey, hey, hey."
00:03:03.141,00:03:05.435,"MAN 3: Don't do it. -Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh."
00:03:05.602,00:03:07.353,HOAG: Put them down.
00:03:09.314,00:03:12.442,"If you have a grievance, you may take it up with my superiors."
00:03:12.817,00:03:15.403,Your superiors. Who the hell are they?
00:03:15.570,00:03:17.196,REPORTER: A joint venture between Stark Industries...
00:03:17.363,00:03:18.364,...and the government...
00:03:18.531,00:03:20.950,"...the Department of Damage Control, will oversee the collection..."
00:03:21.117,00:03:24.162,...and storage of alien and other exotic materials.
00:03:24.329,00:03:27.123,Now the assholes who made this mess are paid to clean it up.
00:03:27.290,00:03:28.541,"Yeah, it's all rigged."
00:03:28.708,00:03:32.295,REPORTER: Experts estimate there are over 1500 tons of exotic material...
00:03:32.462,00:03:34.464,...scattered throughout the tri-state area.
00:03:34.631,00:03:37.967,"Hey, chief! We have another load from yesterday."
00:03:38.635,00:03:39.969,"We're supposed to turn this in, right?"
00:03:40.136,00:03:41.179,I ain't hauling it.
00:03:41.346,00:03:42.555,It's too bad.
00:03:42.722,00:03:45.642,We could have made some cool stuff from all that alien junk.
00:03:48.228,00:03:49.938,I tell you what.
00:03:50.313,00:03:52.190,Let's keep it.
00:03:53.691,00:03:55.360,The world's changing.
00:03:59.364,00:04:01.908,"It's time we change, too."
00:04:46.995,00:04:48.162,"TOOMES: There you go, Mason."
00:04:53.084,00:04:55.169,Business is good.
00:05:37.462,00:05:40.923,"-It's a rough borough, but, hey, it's home. HAPPY: Who you talking to?"
00:05:43.426,00:05:44.635,HAPPY: You know you can't show it to anyone.
00:05:44.802,00:05:45.887,"PETER: Yeah, I know."
00:05:46.054,00:05:47.430,HAPPY: Then why are you narrating in that voice?
00:05:47.597,00:05:50.600,PETER: Um.... Because it's fun. HAPPY: Fun.
00:05:50.767,00:05:53.770,"PETER: So, uh, why do they call you Happy?"
00:05:55.772,00:05:58.608,Come on. I'm not carrying your bags. Let's go.
00:05:58.775,00:06:00.693,"PETER: Hey, should I go to the bathroom before?"
00:06:00.860,00:06:02.028,HAPPY: There's a bathroom on it.
00:06:02.195,00:06:04.280,"PETER: Whoa, no pilot? That's awesome."
00:06:04.447,00:06:05.823,PETER: Ahh. -Is that where you're gonna sit?
00:06:05.990,00:06:07.075,Yeah.
00:06:07.241,00:06:09.243,This is your first time on a private plane?
00:06:09.410,00:06:10.953,My first time on any plane.
00:06:11.120,00:06:13.873,Should it--? Should it be--? Should it be making that noise?
00:06:14.040,00:06:15.500,Shh. Shh.
00:06:22.799,00:06:26.844,No one has actually told me why I'm in Berlin or what I'm doing.
00:06:27.011,00:06:30.223,Something about Captain America going crazy.
00:06:30.389,00:06:32.183,"-This is you. PETER: Oh, we're neighbors?"
00:06:32.350,00:06:34.435,We're not roommates. Suit up.
00:06:34.602,00:06:35.937,"Okay, Peter, you got this."
00:06:36.104,00:06:39.190,HAPPY: What the hell are you wearing? -It's my suit.
00:06:39.357,00:06:41.150,-Where's the case? -What case?
00:06:41.317,00:06:42.902,What? I thought that was a closet.
00:06:43.069,00:06:44.320,-This is still my room? -Go.
00:06:44.487,00:06:46.280,-My room is way bigger than-- -There.
00:06:46.447,00:06:48.157,PETER: I found the case. I found the case.
00:06:48.991,00:06:50.618,A minor upgrade?
00:06:50.785,00:06:52.245,Whoa.
00:06:52.411,00:06:54.038,"Oh, my God."
00:06:54.205,00:06:55.414,-Put it on. -What the--?
00:06:55.581,00:07:00.002,"This is the coolest thing I've ever seen-- -Let's go. -But, yeah. Well, I don't understand."
00:07:00.169,00:07:02.547,"Is it for me? Happy. Happy, wait."
00:07:03.548,00:07:05.591,This is insane. Insane.
00:07:05.758,00:07:07.885,Look at this thing. Look. Look at the eyes.
00:07:08.052,00:07:10.346,-This is the greatest day of my life. Okay. -Let's go.
00:07:12.890,00:07:14.642,"...Black Widow. Whoa, who's that new guy?"
00:07:14.809,00:07:17.645,"TONY: Underoos! -Oh, that's me. I gotta go. I gotta go."
00:07:22.316,00:07:23.860,The craziest thing just happened.
00:07:24.026,00:07:30.158,I just had a fight with Captain America. I stole his shield. I threw it at him-- What the hell? He's big now. I gotta go. Hang on.
00:07:33.453,00:07:36.539,"It was the most amazing thing! Mr. Stark was like, Hey, Underoos!"
00:07:36.706,00:07:43.880,"I flipped in and stole Cap's shield. I was like, What's up, everybody? And-- Hey, just a second! Coming!"
00:07:44.714,00:07:46.299,Hey.
00:07:46.632,00:07:48.259,We have thin walls here.
00:07:49.802,00:07:52.221,"What are you doing, a little video diary?"
00:07:52.972,00:07:54.182,PETER: Yeah. -It's all right.
00:07:54.348,00:07:55.892,-I'd do the same thing. HAPPY: I told him not to.
00:07:56.058,00:07:58.227,-He was filming. I'm gonna wipe the chip. TONY: Okay.
00:07:58.394,00:07:59.437,Hey. You know what?
00:07:59.604,00:08:02.940,We should make an alibi video for your aunt anyway. You ready?
00:08:03.107,00:08:05.526,PETER: An alibi? Sure. Okay. -We rolling? Get in the frame.
00:08:05.693,00:08:08.488,"Hey, May. How you doing? What are you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope."
00:08:08.654,00:08:10.031,Ha-ha-ha.
00:08:10.198,00:08:11.908,"Peter, that's inappropriate. Let's start over."
00:08:12.074,00:08:13.117,-You can edit it. -Mm-hm.
00:08:13.284,00:08:15.203,"-Three, two, one. Hey, May. -Ha-ha-ha."
00:08:15.369,00:08:20.875,"My gosh, uh, I wanted to tell you what an incredible job your nephew did..."
00:08:21.042,00:08:24.921,...this weekend at the Stark internship retreat.
00:08:25.087,00:08:26.088,Everyone was impressed.
00:08:27.423,00:08:29.008,HAPPY: Come on! It's a freaking merge. I'm sorry.
00:08:29.175,00:08:30.718,This is because you're not on Queens Boulevard.
00:08:30.885,00:08:33.888,"See, Happy is hoping to get bumped up to asset management."
00:08:34.055,00:08:36.682,"He was forehead of security, before that he was a driver."
00:08:36.849,00:08:38.809,That was a private conversation.
00:08:38.976,00:08:41.354,I don't like joking about this. It was hard to talk about that.
00:08:41.521,00:08:42.772,"No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?"
00:08:42.939,00:08:44.941,HAPPY: Here we are. End of the line. Whoops.
00:08:47.109,00:08:48.569,TONY: Can you give us a moment?
00:08:48.736,00:08:50.988,-Want me to leave? TONY: Grab Peter's case out of the trunk.
00:08:52.615,00:08:54.158,I can keep the suit?
00:08:54.325,00:08:56.410,"Yes, we were just talking about it."
00:08:57.787,00:09:00.581,"Do me a favor, though. Happy's kind of your point guy on this."
00:09:00.748,00:09:01.749,Don't stress him out.
00:09:01.916,00:09:03.834,Don't do anything stupid. I've seen his cardiogram.
00:09:05.169,00:09:06.754,-All right? -Yes.
00:09:06.921,00:09:10.299,"Don't do anything I would do, and don't do anything I wouldn't do."
00:09:10.466,00:09:13.427,There's a little gray area in there. That's where you operate.
00:09:13.594,00:09:14.845,"-Wait, does that mean I'm an Avenger? -No."
00:09:16.514,00:09:17.974,-This it? TONY: Seventh floor.
00:09:18.140,00:09:20.560,-I can take that. You don't have to. -You'll take it?
00:09:20.726,00:09:23.104,"-Yeah, I can take that. -Thank you."
00:09:24.188,00:09:27.066,"So when's our next, uh--? When's our next retreat, you know?"
00:09:27.233,00:09:29.860,"-What, next mission? -Yeah, the mission. The missions."
00:09:30.027,00:09:31.862,-We'll call you. -Do you have my numbers?
00:09:32.029,00:09:33.239,"No, I mean, we'll call you."
00:09:33.698,00:09:35.575,"-Like, someone will call you. All right? -Oh."
00:09:35.741,00:09:37.994,-From your team. -Okay. All right.
00:09:38.160,00:09:41.998,It's not a hug. I'm just grabbing the door for you. We're not there yet.
00:09:44.250,00:09:45.710,Bye.
00:09:50.715,00:09:52.633,They're gonna call me.
00:10:42.475,00:10:43.726,"What's up, Penis Parker?"
00:10:47.271,00:10:49.440,"Rise and shine, Midtown Science and Technology."
00:10:49.607,00:10:51.567,Don't forget about your homecoming tickets.
00:10:51.734,00:10:53.361,Do you have a date for homecoming?
00:10:53.527,00:10:55.655,"Thanks, Jason, but I already have a date."
00:10:55.821,00:10:57.782,-Okay. -Yeah.
00:10:59.325,00:11:01.035,PETER: Morning.
00:11:03.954,00:11:07.541,"Ahh, damn it. You, in my office right now."
00:11:23.057,00:11:24.475,GIRL 1: Hi!
00:11:28.646,00:11:30.940,...we'll build my new LEGO Death Star.
00:11:31.649,00:11:33.859,-What? GIRL 1: So lame.
00:11:34.026,00:11:35.611,That's awesome. How many pieces?
00:11:37.780,00:11:41.033,-That's insane. -I know. You want to build it tonight?
00:11:41.200,00:11:44.954,"No, I can't tonight. I've got the Stark-- -Mm-hm. Stark internship. -Yeah, exactly."
00:11:45.121,00:11:46.372,Always got that internship.
00:11:46.539,00:11:49.458,"Yeah, well, hopefully, soon it'll lead to a real job with them."
00:11:49.625,00:11:51.127,-That would be so sweet. -Right?
00:11:51.293,00:11:53.671,"He'd be all, Good job on those spreadsheets, Peter."
00:11:53.838,00:11:55.506,Here's a gold coin.
00:11:55.840,00:11:58.134,-I don't know how jobs work. -That's exactly how they work.
00:11:58.300,00:11:59.844,"Oh, heh."
00:12:00.010,00:12:02.054,I'll knock out the bones of the Death Star.
00:12:02.221,00:12:06.142,"I'll come by afterwards. For the most part, the difficult thing is the base of it."
00:12:07.476,00:12:09.770,"The top half we can knock out in two hours, tops."
00:12:11.564,00:12:12.773,That'd be great.
00:12:12.940,00:12:14.316,GIRL 2: I'm gonna be late.
00:12:14.483,00:12:16.819,"Okay, so how do we calculate linear acceleration..."
00:12:16.986,00:12:20.072,...between points A and B?
00:12:20.239,00:12:21.282,Flash.
00:12:21.449,00:12:24.493,It's the product of sine of the angle and gravity divided by mass.
00:12:24.660,00:12:27.955,Nope. Peter. You still with us?
00:12:28.747,00:12:30.958,"PETER: Uh, uh, yeah, yeah."
00:12:31.125,00:12:32.626,Uh....
00:12:33.127,00:12:35.880,"Mass cancels out, so it's just gravity times sine."
00:12:36.046,00:12:40.217,"Right. See, Flash, being the fastest isn't always the best if you are wrong."
00:12:45.639,00:12:49.435,MR. COBWELL: Today we're talking about Danish physicist Niels Bohr...
00:12:49.602,00:12:52.229,"...but trust me, there's nothing Bohr-ing..."
00:12:53.189,00:12:55.691,...about his discoveries regarding quantum theory.
00:13:06.368,00:13:07.703,Did Liz get a new top?
00:13:07.870,00:13:11.624,"NED: No. We've seen that before, but never with that skirt."
00:13:11.790,00:13:14.627,"GIRL 1: Liz, hey. That looks so good. -Hi!"
00:13:14.793,00:13:17.421,We should probably stop staring before it gets creepy.
00:13:17.588,00:13:18.839,MICHELLE: Too late.
00:13:19.256,00:13:20.674,You guys are losers.
00:13:21.425,00:13:23.052,"Well, then why do you sit with us?"
00:13:23.219,00:13:24.762,Because I don't have any friends.
00:13:26.847,00:13:28.766,Next question.

00:13:46.075,00:13:50.037,"I can't go to Washington. If Mr. Stark needs me, I have to make sure I'm here."
00:13:50.204,00:13:52.581,You've never been in the same room as Tony Stark.
00:13:52.748,00:13:53.999,Wait. What's happening?
00:13:54.166,00:13:56.126,-Peter's not going to Washington. CINDY: No.
00:13:56.293,00:13:58.462,"-No, no, no. -Why not?"
00:13:58.629,00:14:00.339,Really? Right before nationals?
00:14:00.506,00:14:02.716,He already quit marching band and robotics lab.
00:14:04.426,00:14:06.595,I'm not obsessed with him. Just very observant.
00:14:06.971,00:14:09.014,"Flash, you're in for Peter."
00:14:09.181,00:14:11.308,FLASH: I don't know. I gotta check my calendar first.
00:14:11.475,00:14:13.686,I got a hot date with Black Widow coming up.
00:14:14.478,00:14:15.646,That is false.
00:14:15.813,00:14:19.191,What'd I tell you about using the bell for comedic purposes?
00:14:35.457,00:14:37.585,"PETER: Hey, what's up? -Hey, man."

00:17:44.354,00:17:46.482,-That's his car. PETER: How was I supposed to know?
00:17:46.648,00:17:49.026,-He was putting that in the window! -Every day with these alarms!

00:18:12.549,00:18:14.051,I stopped a grand theft bicycle.
00:18:14.218,00:18:17.721,"Couldn't find the owner, so I just left a note, um...."
00:18:17.930,00:18:20.224,"I helped this lost, old Dominican lady."
00:18:20.390,00:18:23.268,She was really nice and bought me a churro.
00:18:23.894,00:18:26.605,"I just, um, feel like I could be doing more."
00:18:26.772,00:18:29.983,You know? Just curious when the next real mission's gonna be.
00:18:30.776,00:18:32.444,"So, yeah, just call me back."
00:18:32.611,00:18:35.364,It's Peter. Parker.
00:18:39.910,00:18:42.746,Why would I tell him about the churro?
00:18:46.416,00:18:48.001,"Hey, hey. Aah."
00:18:52.089,00:18:53.841,Okay.

00:19:12.901,00:19:15.445,"We can hit, like, five more places tonight."
00:19:27.040,00:19:29.501,"What's up, guys? You forget your PIN number?"
00:19:29.668,00:19:30.919,"Whoa, you're the Avengers."
00:19:31.503,00:19:33.005,What are you guys doing here?
00:19:35.465,00:19:37.759,Thor. Hulk. Good to finally meet you guys.
00:19:37.968,00:19:39.011,Unh!
00:19:39.178,00:19:41.430,I thought you'd be more handsome in person. Iron Man.
00:19:41.597,00:19:44.516,"Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank? You're a billionaire."
00:19:47.186,00:20:09.499,"Hey-- Uh, Spider-Man is fighting the Avengers in a bank on 21st Street."
00:20:09.666,00:20:11.501,PETER: Let's wrap this up. It's a school night.
00:20:14.504,00:20:15.756,Aah!
00:20:15.923,00:20:18.050,PETER: So how do jerks like you get tech like this?
00:20:20.260,00:20:22.012,"PETER: No. Wait, wait, wait!"
00:20:26.600,00:20:27.935,Mr. Delmar.
00:20:29.603,00:20:32.856,"Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in here? Is anybody in here? Hello?"

00:20:53.543,00:20:54.920,"Yes-- No. No, put that down."
00:20:55.087,00:20:56.421,That's worth more than you or me.
00:20:57.839,00:20:59.841,-Yeah? -The craziest thing just happened.
00:21:00.008,00:21:01.468,These guys were robbing an ATM...
00:21:01.635,00:21:03.845,-...with high-tech weapons-- -Take a breath. I don't have time...
00:21:04.012,00:21:09.309,"-...for ATM robberies... -Yeah, but-- ...or the notes you leave. I have moving day to worry about."
00:21:09.476,00:21:11.186,Everything's gotta be out next week.
00:21:11.603,00:21:14.982,"-Wait. You're moving? Who's moving? -Yeah, don't you watch the news?"
00:21:15.148,00:21:18.443,Tony sold Avengers Tower. We're relocating to a new facility upstate...
00:21:18.610,00:21:21.822,-...where hopefully cell service is worse. -But what about me?
00:21:22.197,00:21:23.740,-What about you? -Unh!
00:21:23.907,00:21:26.952,"Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me or something big goes down?"
00:21:27.452,00:21:30.580,-Can I please talk to Mr. Stark? -Stay away from anything dangerous.
00:21:30.747,00:21:33.500,"I'm responsible for making sure you're responsible, okay?"
00:21:35.460,00:21:37.879,"I am responsible. I-- Oh, crap."
00:21:38.046,00:21:40.465,-My backpack's gone. -That doesn't sound responsible.
00:21:40.632,00:21:43.635,-I'll call you back. -Feel free not to.
00:22:43.904,00:22:45.781,MAY: What was that?
00:22:45.947,00:22:48.325,"Uh, it's nothing. Nothing."
00:22:48.492,00:22:50.202,You're the Spider-Man.
00:22:50.368,00:22:53.205,-From YouTube. -I'm not. I'm not.
00:22:53.371,00:22:55.665,-You were on the ceiling. -No. What are you doing in my room?
00:22:55.832,00:22:57.751,May let me in. We were gonna finish the Death Star.
00:22:57.918,00:23:00.128,You can't just bust into my room!
00:23:00.295,00:23:03.006,Ha-ha. That turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster.
00:23:03.173,00:23:05.801,"Let's go to dinner. Thai? Ned, you want Thai?"
00:23:05.967,00:23:07.219,-Yes. -No. He's got a thing.
00:23:07.385,00:23:09.971,A thing to do after.
00:23:10.347,00:23:12.015,Okay.
00:23:12.933,00:23:14.851,Maybe put on some clothes.
00:23:16.353,00:23:18.355,"-Oh, she doesn't know? -Nobody knows."
00:23:18.522,00:23:20.774,Mr. Stark knows because he made my suit. That's it.
00:23:25.570,00:23:26.905,"Yeah, basically."
00:23:27.114,00:23:28.323,Whoa....
00:23:28.490,00:23:31.368,You can't tell anybody about this. You gotta keep it a secret.
00:23:33.537,00:23:36.540,"If she finds out people try and kill me every night, she won't let me do this."
00:23:36.706,00:23:37.916,"Come on, Ned, please."
00:23:38.083,00:23:39.793,"Okay, okay, okay."
00:23:39.960,00:23:42.671,I'll level with you. I can't keep this a secret.
00:23:42.838,00:23:44.589,It's the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.
00:23:44.756,00:23:47.425,"Ned, May cannot know. I cannot do that to her right now."
00:23:47.592,00:23:51.346,"You know? I mean, everything that's happened with her, I-- Please."
00:23:53.723,00:23:56.393,"-Okay. -Just swear it, okay?"
00:23:56.852,00:23:57.894,I swear.
00:23:58.061,00:24:00.105,-Thank you. -Yeah.
00:24:00.272,00:24:02.190,I can't believe this is happening now.
00:24:02.357,00:24:03.608,-Can I try the suit on? -No.
00:24:03.775,00:24:05.610,How's it work? Magnets? How do you shoot the strings?
00:24:05.777,00:24:07.988,-I'm gonna tell you at school tomorrow. -Great.
00:24:08.155,00:24:10.115,"Okay, well, wait, then."
00:24:10.282,00:24:13.785,How do you do this and the Stark internship?
00:24:14.744,00:24:17.038,This is the Stark internship.
00:24:17.247,00:24:20.250,-Oh. -Just get out of here.
00:24:23.128,00:24:24.462,MAY: What's the matter?
00:24:25.046,00:24:26.548,Thought you loved larb.
00:24:27.215,00:24:28.884,It's too larby?
00:24:29.050,00:24:31.761,Not larby enough.
00:24:31.928,00:24:36.516,How many times do I have to say larb before you talk to me?
00:24:36.683,00:24:38.852,You know I larb you.
00:24:39.019,00:24:42.063,"I'm just stressed. The internship, and I'm tired."
00:24:42.230,00:24:43.273,A lot of work.
00:24:43.440,00:24:45.692,The Stark internship.
00:24:45.859,00:24:49.487,"I have to tell you, not a fan of that Tony Stark."
00:24:50.447,00:24:53.909,You're distracted all the time. He's got you in your head.
00:24:55.869,00:24:57.162,What does he have you doing?
00:24:57.329,00:24:58.914,-...in an explosion... -You need to use your instincts.
00:24:59.080,00:25:02.209,...after an ATM robbery was thwarted by Queens' own crime stopper...
00:25:02.375,00:25:03.460,What?
00:25:03.627,00:25:05.170,...the Spider-Man.
00:25:05.337,00:25:07.672,As the Spider-Man attempted to foil their heist...
00:25:07.839,00:25:11.509,"...a powerful blast was set off, slicing through the bodega across the street."
00:25:11.676,00:25:13.720,"Miraculously, no one was harmed."
00:25:13.887,00:25:17.974,"If you spot something like that happening, you turn and you run the other way."
00:25:18.141,00:25:19.893,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course."
00:25:20.060,00:25:21.353,Six blocks away from us.
00:25:21.519,00:25:23.521,"I, uh, need a new backpack."
00:25:24.898,00:25:27.150,-What? -I need a new backpack.
00:25:27.609,00:25:28.818,MAY: That's five.
00:25:30.028,00:25:32.364,-Sticky rice pudding. -We didn't order that.
00:25:32.530,00:25:34.366,It's on the house.
00:25:34.574,00:25:36.409,"Oh, thanks."
00:25:38.119,00:25:40.455,That's nice of him.
00:25:40.622,00:25:43.500,"I think he larbs you, heh."
00:25:44.751,00:25:46.336,NED: You got bit by a spider?
00:25:46.503,00:25:47.963,Can it bite me?
00:25:48.129,00:25:49.965,"Well, it probably would've hurt, right?"
00:25:50.131,00:25:52.425,"Whatever. Even if it did hurt, I'd let it bite me."
00:25:52.592,00:25:54.177,Maybe. How much did it hurt?
00:25:54.344,00:25:56.554,"The spider's dead, Ned."
00:25:59.766,00:26:01.268,Whoa.
00:26:05.021,00:26:06.898,NED: You were here?
00:26:07.524,00:26:09.025,PETER: Yeah.
00:26:09.818,00:26:11.820,You could've died.
00:26:14.656,00:26:16.908,-Do you lay eggs? -What?
00:26:17.075,00:26:18.076,No. Ha-ha.
00:26:20.495,00:26:23.290,-Can you spit venom? -No.
00:26:23.456,00:26:25.750,Can you summon an army of spiders?
00:26:25.917,00:26:27.002,"No, Ned."
00:26:27.168,00:26:30.088,The Sokovia Accords were put into place....
00:26:34.092,00:26:35.343,--to begin regulating....
00:26:35.510,00:26:37.846,"If I was you, I would stand on a building..."
00:26:38.013,00:26:41.391,"-...and just shoot it as far as I could-- -Shut up, Ned."
00:26:41.558,00:26:45.437,Hi. I'm Captain America. Whether you're in the classroom or on the battlefield...
00:26:45.603,00:26:47.272,"-Do you know him too? -Yeah, we met."

00:27:00.785,00:27:02.996,It's required by the state. Let's do it.
00:27:03.163,00:27:04.664,NED: Do Avengers have to pay taxes? PETER: Shh!
00:27:04.831,00:27:06.458,NED: What does Hulk smell like? PETER: Shh!
00:27:06.624,00:27:08.626,NED: I bet he smells nice. PETER: You have to shut up.
00:27:08.793,00:27:11.504,"Is Captain America cool, or is he like a mean, old grandpa?"
00:27:11.671,00:27:13.590,"Ned, just, shh, okay?"
00:27:13.757,00:27:17.260,"-Hey, can I be your guy in the chair? -What?"
00:27:17.427,00:27:19.971,Yeah. You know how there's a guy with a headset...
00:27:20.138,00:27:21.973,...telling the other guy where to go?
00:27:22.140,00:27:24.976,"If you're in a burning building, I could tell you where to go."
00:27:25.143,00:27:27.729,"There'd be screens around me, and I could swivel around."
00:27:27.896,00:27:30.982,-I could be your guy in the chair. -I don't need a guy in the chair.
00:27:31.149,00:27:32.817,"Looking good, Parker."
00:27:34.736,00:27:38.490,"Now, see, for me, it would be F Thor..."
00:27:38.656,00:27:40.533,...marry Iron Man and kill Hulk.
00:27:40.700,00:27:42.535,"Well, what about the Spider-Man?"
00:27:42.702,00:27:43.912,LIZ: It's just Spider-Man.
00:27:44.079,00:27:47.290,Did you see the bank security cam on YouTube? He fought off four guys.
00:27:47.457,00:27:49.292,"Oh, my God, she's crushing on Spider-Man."
00:27:49.459,00:27:50.543,No way.
00:27:50.710,00:27:52.754,"-Kind of. -Oh, gross."
00:27:54.005,00:27:55.840,-He's probably 30. -You don't know what he looks like.
00:27:56.007,00:27:57.967,"Like, what if he's seriously burned?"
00:27:58.134,00:28:00.845,I wouldn't care. I'd love him for the person he is inside.
00:28:01.012,00:28:02.889,Peter knows Spider-Man.
00:28:05.683,00:28:10.355,"No, I don't. No. I-- I mean-- They're friends."
00:28:10.522,00:28:13.483,"Yeah, like Coach Wilson and Captain America are friends. Heh."
00:28:14.025,00:28:16.361,"I've met him, yeah. A couple times."
00:28:16.861,00:28:17.904,"But it's, um..."
00:28:18.780,00:28:21.950,...through the Stark internship. Mm-hm.
00:28:22.158,00:28:24.577,"Yeah, well, I'm not really supposed to talk about it."
00:28:24.744,00:28:26.621,"Well, that's awesome. Hey, you know what?"
00:28:26.788,00:28:29.457,Maybe you should invite him to Liz's party. Right?
00:28:29.624,00:28:32.919,"Yeah, I'm having people over tonight. You're more than welcome to come."
00:28:33.086,00:28:35.505,"-Having a party? FLASH: Yeah, it's gonna be dope."
00:28:35.672,00:28:37.757,You should totally invite your personal friend Spider-Man.
00:28:37.924,00:28:40.176,-Um.... -It's okay.
00:28:40.343,00:28:43.054,"I know Peter's way too busy for parties anyway, so...."
00:28:43.221,00:28:45.056,"Come on. He'll be there. Right, Parker?"
00:28:51.730,00:28:52.897,What are you doing?
00:28:53.064,00:28:54.566,Helping you out.
00:28:54.733,00:28:56.317,Did you not hear her?
00:28:56.484,00:28:58.945,Liz has a crush on you.
00:29:01.823,00:29:03.450,"Dude, you're an Avenger."
00:29:03.616,00:29:07.495,"If any one of us has a chance with a senior girl, it's you."
00:29:11.332,00:29:13.293,MAY: House party in the suburbs.
00:29:13.460,00:29:16.838,"Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous."
00:29:17.005,00:29:19.632,"-It'll be a night to remember. -Oh, ha-ha-ha."
00:29:19.799,00:29:22.510,"Ned, some hats wear men. You wear that hat."
00:29:22.677,00:29:24.637,"-Yeah, it gives me confidence. -Heh."
00:29:24.804,00:29:26.014,This is a mistake.
00:29:26.181,00:29:27.432,"Hey, let's just go home."
00:29:27.599,00:29:29.058,"Oh, Peter."
00:29:29.225,00:29:31.978,I know. I know it's really hard...
00:29:32.145,00:29:35.398,...trying to fit in with all the changes your body's going through.
00:29:35.565,00:29:36.608,It's flowering now.
00:29:36.816,00:29:38.193,"Uh-huh. Heh, heh."
00:29:38.860,00:29:40.862,He's so stressed out lately.
00:29:41.029,00:29:42.614,What helps with stress is a party.
00:29:42.781,00:29:45.658,"-We should go to the party. -Yeah, let's do it. I'm gonna go."
00:29:47.243,00:29:48.703,Peter.
00:29:49.412,00:29:51.623,"-Have fun, okay? Okay. -I will."
00:29:51.790,00:29:52.791,"Bye, May."
00:29:54.751,00:29:55.752,GIRL: Come dance with me!
00:29:55.919,00:29:57.754,"Dude, you have the suit, right?"
00:29:57.921,00:30:00.173,-Yeah. -This is gonna change our lives.
00:30:05.094,00:30:07.013,"GIRL 1: Annie, over here! -Hey."
00:30:07.180,00:30:08.348,Hey.
00:30:14.270,00:30:16.481,Okay. We're gonna have Spider-Man swing in...
00:30:16.648,00:30:20.610,"...say you guys are tight, and I get a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs."
00:30:20.777,00:30:22.904,Can't believe you're at this lame party.
00:30:23.071,00:30:24.280,But you're here too.
00:30:25.448,00:30:26.991,Am I?
00:30:29.494,00:30:32.747,"Oh, my gosh. Hey, guys. Cool hat, Ned."
00:30:32.914,00:30:34.666,"-Hi, Liz. -Hi, Liz."
00:30:34.833,00:30:36.709,I'm so happy you guys came.
00:30:36.876,00:30:39.379,There's pizza and drinks. Help yourself.
00:30:40.380,00:30:42.841,-What a great party. -Thanks.
00:30:45.510,00:30:51.224,"Oh, I-- My parents will kill me if anything's broken. I gotta-- -Yeah. -Have fun."
00:30:51.391,00:30:53.351,-Bye. LIZ: Bye.
00:30:53.518,00:30:55.520,"Dude, what are you doing?"
00:30:55.687,00:30:57.772,She's here. Spider it up.
00:30:57.939,00:31:00.567,"No, no, no. I can't-- I cannot do this."
00:31:00.733,00:31:02.986,"Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay?"
00:31:03.152,00:31:05.822,"Look, I'm just gonna be myself."
00:31:06.573,00:31:08.283,"Peter, no one wants that."
00:31:08.658,00:31:10.243,Dude.
00:31:10.660,00:31:13.538,"Penis Parker, what's up?"
00:31:14.038,00:31:15.540,So where's your pal Spider-Man?
00:31:15.707,00:31:18.251,Let me guess: In Canada with your imaginary girlfriend?
00:31:19.961,00:31:22.964,That's not Spider-Man. That's just Ned in a red shirt.
00:31:31.681,00:31:33.600,"Hey, what's up? I'm Spider-Man."
00:31:33.766,00:31:36.811,Just thought I'd swing by and say hello to my buddy Peter.
00:31:36.978,00:31:39.147,"Oh, what's up, Ned? Hey, where's Peter, anyways?"
00:31:39.314,00:31:40.607,He must be around....
00:31:45.695,00:31:48.573,"God, this is stupid. What am I doing?"
00:31:57.665,00:31:58.791,What the hell?
00:32:05.840,00:32:08.051,Whoo! Unh!
00:32:20.313,00:32:21.356,This sucks.
00:32:23.650,00:32:26.653,Whoo! Ha-ha-ha.
00:32:26.819,00:32:30.907,"Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia."
00:32:31.074,00:32:32.367,Here. You try.
00:32:34.160,00:32:37.330,"I wanted something low-key. Why are you trying to upsell me, man?"
00:32:37.497,00:32:39.582,"BRICE: Okay, okay. I got what you need, all right?"
00:32:39.749,00:32:42.543,I got tons of great stuff here. One sec.
00:32:43.294,00:32:47.757,"Okay, I got, uh, black-hole grenades, Chitauri railguns...."
00:32:47.924,00:32:50.009,SCHULTZ: You letting off shots in public now? Hurry up.
00:32:50.176,00:32:53.805,"Look, times are changing. We're the only ones selling these high-tech weapons."
00:32:54.013,00:32:57.225,"Oh, this must be where the ATM robbers got their stuff."
00:32:57.392,00:33:01.771,I need something to stick up somebody. I'm not trying to shoot them back in time.
00:33:01.938,00:33:04.148,I got antigrav climbers.
00:33:04.315,00:33:05.441,"Yo, climbers?"
00:33:07.902,00:33:09.195,"Okay, what the hell is that?"
00:33:11.656,00:33:13.366,"-Did you set us up? -Hey, hey, man."
00:33:16.494,00:33:19.706,"Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna shoot at somebody, shoot at me."
00:33:19.872,00:33:20.999,All right.
00:33:22.208,00:33:23.209,Unh!
00:33:23.376,00:33:24.919,PETER: Aah! Aah!
00:33:33.511,00:33:35.638,What was that?
00:33:36.597,00:33:38.182,"Oh, no, no! Unh!"
00:33:42.311,00:33:44.147,What--? Aah!
00:33:46.733,00:33:49.944,"-We gotta call him. -No, no, no."
00:33:50.153,00:33:51.863,Aah! Unh!
00:33:55.742,00:33:56.909,SCHULTZ: Did you just do it again?
00:33:57.076,00:33:59.245,-Shut up. -I'm calling him.
00:34:08.212,00:34:09.213,Toomes' phone.
00:34:11.340,00:34:12.884,MASON: Boss.
00:34:13.051,00:34:15.261,"Oh, my butt! Unh!"
00:34:34.197,00:34:37.033,Great. Guess I'm gonna have to take a shortcut.
00:34:39.786,00:34:41.829,"Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun."
00:34:41.996,00:34:43.748,"Hey, hey, buddy."
00:34:43.915,00:34:46.417,"Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch."

00:35:08.231,00:35:09.732,PETER: Great movie!
00:35:14.987,00:35:17.240,"Ugh.... Oh, hey, guys."
00:35:17.406,00:35:20.368,BOTH: Aah! PETER: No! No!
00:35:23.579,00:35:24.914,"Peter, where are you?"
00:35:25.081,00:35:26.958,The hat's not working. This is not cool.
00:35:28.000,00:35:29.377,Almost got you.
00:35:42.223,00:35:44.475,"Thought you got away from me, didn't you?"
00:35:47.979,00:35:49.856,Surprise!
00:35:53.151,00:35:54.944,What the hell?
00:36:40.198,00:36:41.490,Huh?
00:36:41.657,00:36:43.951,"Oh, hey."
00:36:47.413,00:36:50.458,"And then he just, like, swooped down like a monster..."
00:36:50.625,00:36:54.170,"...and picked me up, and took me up like a thousand feet and just dropped me."
00:36:54.670,00:36:57.173,How'd you find me? Did you put a tracker in my suit?
00:36:57.340,00:36:59.175,TONY: I put everything in your suit.
00:36:59.342,00:37:00.676,Including this heater.
00:37:01.135,00:37:03.221,Whoa!
00:37:03.387,00:37:05.223,"Whew, that's better. Thanks."
00:37:06.557,00:37:07.683,What were you thinking?
00:37:07.850,00:37:11.145,The guy with wings is the source of the weapons. I gotta take him down.
00:37:11.312,00:37:12.980,"Take him down now, huh?"
00:37:13.147,00:37:15.942,"Crockett, there are people who handle this sort of thing."
00:37:16.108,00:37:18.945,-The Avengers? -No. This is a little below their pay grade.
00:37:19.111,00:37:21.113,"Mr. Stark, you didn't have to come out here."
00:37:21.280,00:37:22.698,I had that. I was fine.
00:37:23.324,00:37:26.285,"Oh, I'm not here."
00:37:27.161,00:37:28.955,Thank God this place has Wi-Fi...
00:37:29.121,00:37:30.957,...or you would be toast right now.
00:37:31.123,00:37:34.085,Thank Ganesh while you're at it. Cheers.
00:37:34.252,00:37:36.420,"Look, forget the flying vulture guy, please."
00:37:36.587,00:37:37.630,-Why? -Why?
00:37:37.797,00:37:39.840,Because I said so!
00:37:40.007,00:37:43.010,"Sorry, I'm talking to a teenager."
00:37:43.177,00:37:44.637,Stay close to the ground.
00:37:44.804,00:37:48.849,"Build up your game helping little people, like that lady that bought you the churro."
00:37:49.475,00:37:52.395,Can't you just be a friendly...
00:37:53.020,00:37:54.397,...neighborhood Spider-Man?
00:37:54.563,00:37:56.274,But I'm ready for more than that now.
00:37:56.774,00:37:57.817,"No, you're not."
00:37:57.984,00:38:00.278,That's not what you thought when I took on Captain America.
00:38:00.444,00:38:03.072,"Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted to lay you out, he would've."
00:38:03.489,00:38:06.701,"Listen to me. If you come across these weapons again, call Happy."
00:38:08.327,00:38:09.620,Are you driving?
00:38:09.787,00:38:12.790,"You know, it's never too early to start thinking about college."
00:38:12.957,00:38:14.709,I got some pull at MIT. End call.
00:38:16.294,00:38:19.797,"No, I don't need to go to-- FRIDAY: Mr. Stark is no longer connected."
00:38:22.508,00:38:24.343,That's awesome.
00:38:26.971,00:38:30.433,Stay close to the ground? What is he talking about?
00:38:41.152,00:38:42.737,Whoa.
00:38:49.535,00:38:51.162,"Hey, what's up? I'm on my way back."
00:38:51.329,00:38:54.540,"Actually, I was calling to say maybe you shouldn't come. Listen."
00:38:54.707,00:38:56.917,"FLASH: When I say penis, you say Parker."
00:38:57.084,00:38:58.085,-Penis! ALL: Parker!
00:38:58.252,00:38:59.462,-Penis! -Parker!
00:38:59.962,00:39:02.173,"NED: Sorry, Peter. I guess we're still losers."
00:39:02.340,00:39:05.301,-I'll see you tomorrow. -I'll see you tomorrow in school.
00:39:31.952,00:39:33.537,Whoa.
00:39:33.704,00:39:34.705,"Whoa, whoa."
00:39:45.341,00:39:47.051,Idiots.
00:39:47.885,00:39:49.011,Idiots.
00:39:49.178,00:39:50.721,Idiots!
00:39:51.555,00:39:52.598,MASON: Boss?
00:39:52.932,00:39:56.227,Your wife keeps texting you. Something about a brake light.
00:39:56.644,00:39:58.813,What'd I tell you about looking at my phone?
00:39:58.979,00:40:00.231,Oh. Sorry. You left it out.
00:40:00.398,00:40:02.233,You know I'm a curious person by nature.
00:40:04.276,00:40:07.279,I finished designing that high-altitude vacuum seal.
00:40:07.488,00:40:08.489,Huh?
00:40:08.656,00:40:11.534,"In case you want to, you know, go for the big one?"
00:40:11.700,00:40:13.744,"You're still on that? I told you, no."
00:40:13.911,00:40:15.454,The answer's no. Forget it.
00:40:19.708,00:40:22.169,Ha-ha-ha! Whoo!
00:40:25.005,00:40:26.590,Ha-ha.
00:40:27.133,00:40:29.593,"I mean, that was badass. Ha."
00:40:32.221,00:40:36.100,How many times have I told you not to fire them out in the open?
00:40:36.267,00:40:38.811,"-You said, move the merchandise. -Under the radar."
00:40:38.978,00:40:40.187,Under the radar!
00:40:40.354,00:40:42.106,That's how we survive.
00:40:42.273,00:40:45.609,"If you bring Damage Control or the Avengers down here, we're through."
00:40:46.235,00:40:49.196,"You're out there wearing that goofy thing, lighting up cars..."
00:40:49.363,00:40:50.865,...calling yourself the Shocker.
00:40:51.031,00:40:54.160,"I'm the Shocker. I shock people. What is this, pro wrestling?"
00:40:54.326,00:40:56.120,"Ah, whatever, old man. Come on."
00:40:57.580,00:40:58.998,Look.
00:40:59.165,00:41:00.583,Look.
00:41:00.749,00:41:03.419,I know you don't give a crap about anything.
00:41:03.586,00:41:05.212,But I do.
00:41:05.379,00:41:08.507,I built this whole place because I got people I have to look after.
00:41:08.674,00:41:11.886,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:41:14.138,00:41:15.556,You know what?
00:41:15.723,00:41:18.392,I can't afford your bullshit.
00:41:18.559,00:41:20.019,-Get out of here. -What?
00:41:20.186,00:41:23.481,"-You're done. You're off the crew. -Yeah, all right."
00:41:24.356,00:41:25.399,All right. Heh.
00:41:25.566,00:41:27.985,"Wonder if you can afford me out there, though, right?"
00:41:28.152,00:41:29.987,With everything I know.
00:41:30.946,00:41:33.782,"-Excuse me? -Uh, I'm just saying..."
00:41:34.116,00:41:37.786,...maybe your wife would like to know where you really get your money from.
00:41:38.579,00:41:40.206,-You know what? -What?
00:41:40.581,00:41:41.749,You're right.
00:41:41.916,00:41:43.375,-That work? -I don't know.
00:41:44.668,00:41:46.212,I can't afford that.
00:41:46.420,00:41:48.923,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait."
00:41:55.554,00:41:57.056,Damn.
00:41:59.642,00:42:02.019,-I thought this was the antigravity gun. -What?
00:42:02.186,00:42:03.270,"No, that's that one."
00:42:16.742,00:42:17.785,Here.
00:42:19.078,00:42:22.957,Now you're the Shocker. Go out there and find that weapon he lost.
00:42:23.123,00:42:24.166,All right.
00:42:29.880,00:42:30.923,Oh.
00:42:33.592,00:42:35.386,"NED: Hey, thanks for bailing on me."
00:42:35.553,00:42:37.513,"Yeah, well, something came up."
00:42:37.680,00:42:38.889,What is that?
00:42:39.306,00:42:41.850,I don't know. Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.
00:42:42.017,00:42:43.477,-Seriously? -Yeah.
00:42:43.644,00:42:45.104,Awesome.
00:42:45.271,00:42:48.357,"I mean, not awesome. Heh, totally uncool of that guy."
00:42:48.524,00:42:50.317,So scary.
00:42:51.652,00:42:53.320,"Well, look, I think it's..."
00:42:53.487,00:42:54.947,...a power source.
00:42:55.114,00:42:57.700,"Yeah, but it's connected to all these microprocessors."
00:42:57.866,00:43:01.078,That's an inductive charging plate. That's what I use to charge my toothbrush.
00:43:01.245,00:43:04.290,Whoever's making these weapons is combining alien tech with ours.
00:43:04.456,00:43:08.335,That is literally the coolest sentence anyone has ever said.
00:43:08.502,00:43:11.547,I just want to thank you for letting me be part of your journey...
00:43:11.714,00:43:19.722,...into this amazing-- Keep your fingers clear of the blades.
00:43:21.849,00:43:23.976,I gotta figure out what this is and who makes it.
00:43:24.143,00:43:26.353,NED: We'll go to the lab after class and run tests.
00:43:26.520,00:43:27.813,Let's do it.
00:43:35.279,00:43:37.573,"First, we put the glowy thing in the mass spectrometer."
00:43:37.740,00:43:40.200,We gotta come up with a better name than glowy thingy.
00:43:40.367,00:43:41.452,You're right.
00:43:42.953,00:43:44.079,Crap.
00:43:50.836,00:43:52.379,High schools creep me out.
00:43:53.088,00:43:55.049,"They got this funny smell, you know?"
00:43:55.215,00:43:57.509,"Hey, that's one of the guys that tried to kill me."
00:43:58.886,00:44:00.387,-Yeah. -We gotta get out of here.
00:44:00.554,00:44:02.431,"No, no, no. I gotta follow them."
00:44:02.598,00:44:05.184,They can lead me to the guy that dropped me in the lake.
00:44:05.351,00:44:07.603,"-Someone dropped you in a lake? -Yeah, it was not good."
00:44:09.605,00:44:11.023,"-Peter-- -No. Stay there, Ned."
00:44:11.190,00:44:12.775,Peter.
00:44:15.778,00:44:17.071,What are you doing?
00:44:18.572,00:44:20.824,-Oh. -Yeah. You good?
00:44:20.991,00:44:22.034,Chess.
00:44:24.995,00:44:28.415,RANDY: Can you imagine what the boss would say if he knew where we were?
00:44:28.582,00:44:30.668,It's saying there was an energy pulse here.
00:44:30.834,00:44:32.294,RANDY: There's no sign of the weapon.
00:44:32.461,00:44:35.381,"-And even if it was here, now it's gone. -So are we."
00:45:07.996,00:45:10.916,This is so awesome.
00:45:11.083,00:45:12.918,"I know, right?"
00:45:16.130,00:45:17.923,They're in Brooklyn.
00:45:22.094,00:45:24.054,Staten Island.
00:45:29.768,00:45:31.687,Leaving Jersey.
00:45:39.278,00:45:40.904,They stopped.
00:45:41.613,00:45:43.031,Huh.
00:45:43.657,00:45:44.741,Maryland?
00:45:44.908,00:45:47.161,-What's there? -I don't know.
00:45:47.327,00:45:48.370,Evil lair? Heh.
00:45:48.912,00:45:50.956,-They have a lair? -A gang with alien guns...
00:45:51.123,00:45:52.916,...run by a guy with wings? Yeah.
00:45:53.083,00:45:54.501,Badass.
00:45:54.668,00:45:57.546,"But how are you gonna get there if it's, like, 300 miles away?"
00:45:59.798,00:46:02.384,It's not too far from D.C.
00:46:03.469,00:46:04.595,"-Hey, it's Peter. -Guys."
00:46:04.761,00:46:05.804,"-Peter? -Hey, buddy."
00:46:05.971,00:46:07.848,I was hoping I could rejoin the team.
00:46:08.015,00:46:09.641,"No, no way. You can't quit on us..."
00:46:09.808,00:46:12.436,...stroll up and be welcomed back by everyone.
00:46:12.603,00:46:15.481,"Hey, welcome back! Flash, you're back to first alternate."
00:46:15.647,00:46:16.982,-What? -He's taking your place.
00:46:17.149,00:46:18.525,"Excuse me, can we go already?"
00:46:18.692,00:46:22.488,I was hoping to get in some protesting in front of an embassy before dinner.
00:46:22.654,00:46:25.115,Protesting is patriotic. Let's get on the bus.
00:46:27.075,00:46:30.662,LIZ: Focus up. Our next topic is the moons of Saturn.
00:46:30.829,00:46:32.456,The second law of thermodynamics.
00:46:32.998,00:46:34.917,-Frank Sinatra. -Fort Sumter.
00:46:35.626,00:46:37.920,"-Flash is wrong. -Okay, let's focus. Next one."
00:46:38.086,00:46:39.421,"Liz, don't overwork them."
00:46:39.922,00:46:41.632,"Uh, strontium, barium, vibranium."
00:46:41.798,00:46:44.510,"-Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back. -Glad to be back."
00:46:46.136,00:46:49.139,-What is the current standard unit of--? -Can I take this real quick?
00:46:49.306,00:46:50.807,"Yeah, fine."
00:46:50.974,00:46:52.768,-Hello? -Got a blip on my screen here.
00:46:52.935,00:46:53.977,You left New York?
00:46:54.144,00:46:55.979,"LIZ: Okay, focus up, everyone. -Tracker. Uh...."
00:46:56.146,00:46:58.065,"Yeah, it's just a school trip. It's, uh, nothing."
00:46:58.232,00:47:00.651,"Happy, I gotta say, tracking me without permission..."
00:47:00.817,00:47:02.611,...is a complete violation of privacy.
00:47:03.403,00:47:05.113,-That's different. -What's different?
00:47:05.280,00:47:07.741,"Nothing. Look, it's just the Academic Decathlon."
00:47:07.908,00:47:10.994,"-It's no big deal. -Hey, hey. I'll decide if it's no big deal."
00:47:13.163,00:47:15.749,"Sounds like no big deal, but remember, I'm watching you."
00:47:27.052,00:47:29.721,-Everyone stick together. -Yeah.
00:47:30.222,00:47:32.057,CHARLES: You kidding me? This place is huge.
00:47:32.224,00:47:34.810,FLASH: I've seen bigger. -There's a bird in here.
00:47:34.977,00:47:38.230,"-Hey, you brought your laptop, right? -Why?"
00:47:46.280,00:47:47.656,Peter...
00:47:47.823,00:47:50.826,...why are we removing the tracker from your suit?
00:47:51.201,00:47:52.202,Uh...
00:47:52.369,00:47:55.497,...I gotta follow these guys to their boss before they move again...
00:47:55.664,00:47:58.584,...and I don't really want Mr. Stark to know about it.
00:47:58.750,00:48:00.586,So you're lying to Iron Man now?
00:48:00.752,00:48:02.379,"No, I'm not lying."
00:48:02.546,00:48:05.173,He just doesn't really get what I can do yet.
00:48:06.800,00:48:08.218,PETER: Ah....
00:48:09.761,00:48:11.263,Gotcha.
00:48:11.430,00:48:15.601,"All right, Happy, enjoy tracking this lamp."
00:48:18.562,00:48:20.981,There's a ton of other subsystems in here...
00:48:21.148,00:48:23.025,-Hmm? -...but they're all disabled...
00:48:23.191,00:48:25.402,...by the Training Wheels Protocol.
00:48:25.569,00:48:26.695,What?
00:48:26.862,00:48:30.490,Training Wheels Protocol? Turn it off.
00:48:30.657,00:48:33.577,I don't think that's a good idea. They're blocked for a reason.
00:48:33.994,00:48:36.330,"Come on, man, I don't need training wheels."
00:48:36.496,00:48:38.874,I'm sick of him treating me like a kid all the time.
00:48:39.041,00:48:41.335,-It's not cool. -But you are a kid.
00:48:41.501,00:48:43.587,A kid who can stop a bus with his bare hands.
00:48:43.754,00:48:47.507,"Peter, I just don't think this is a great idea. I mean, what if this is illegal?"
00:48:47.674,00:48:50.636,"Look, please. This is my chance to prove myself."
00:48:50.802,00:48:52.554,"I can handle it. Ned, come on."
00:48:52.721,00:48:55.432,-I don't think this is a good idea. -The guy in the chair.
00:48:55.891,00:48:58.060,-Don't do that. -Come on.
00:49:12.157,00:49:14.076,"The glowy thing, it's evidence. Keep it safe."
00:49:14.242,00:49:15.827,-All right? -Okay. Okay.
00:49:17.454,00:49:18.997,-They're moving. -Be careful.
00:49:25.170,00:49:26.296,We're gonna go swimming.
00:49:28.799,00:49:30.550,"-Hey, Peter. -Hi."
00:49:32.219,00:49:33.553,Hey.

00:49:46.108,00:49:47.109,Hmm?
00:49:47.275,00:49:51.905,"Um, well, I read that in a TED Talk, so-- I-- I heard it in a TED Talk."
00:49:52.072,00:49:53.990,And I read a coaching book.
00:49:55.075,00:49:57.160,"Wow, you really-- This is really important to you."
00:49:57.327,00:49:59.204,Yeah. It's our future.
00:49:59.371,00:50:00.789,I'm not gonna screw it up.
00:50:01.832,00:50:05.711,"Besides, we raided the minibar and these candy bars were, like, $11."
00:50:05.877,00:50:09.131,-So get your trunks on and come on. CHARLES: Come on.
00:50:09.297,00:50:11.425,"SALLY: Come on. LIZ: I'm coming, I'm coming."

00:50:48.503,00:50:51.214,I put a tracker on someone. He's a bad guy.

00:52:35.777,00:52:37.487,PETER: That one. -Great choice.
00:52:37.863,00:52:40.240,Would you like me to set this as your new default?
00:52:41.658,00:52:42.784,"No, no, no."
00:52:42.951,00:52:45.495,"-Push that in. No, the other-- -Here? This one here?"
00:52:45.662,00:52:47.998,-What was that? -Taser webs.
00:52:48.164,00:52:50.000,Taser webs? I don't want Taser webs.
00:52:50.166,00:52:52.669,You seem to be unfamiliar with your web-shooter settings.
00:52:53.169,00:52:54.880,Would you like to run a refresher course?
00:52:55.046,00:52:57.382,-No. Just-- You choose. -Sure thing.
00:53:00.385,00:53:03.847,"Copy, central. Six-alpha-niner on schedule."
00:53:06.558,00:53:08.518,"SCHULTZ: I got a visual. -Green light, green light."
00:53:13.106,00:53:14.399,"Oh, that's him."
00:53:18.153,00:53:20.196,Okay. I got eyes on the convoy.
00:53:20.363,00:53:21.781,Pulling in behind the caboose.
00:53:35.420,00:53:36.755,Dropping down.
00:53:39.341,00:53:41.259,No outgoing distress signals. You're clear.
00:53:43.219,00:53:46.514,Hey. Looks like they got some good stuff here.
00:53:54.064,00:53:57.817,"Whoa, cool. It's like some kind of matter phase shifter."
00:54:02.447,00:54:04.366,"All right, coming up."
00:54:09.704,00:54:11.831,"Hey, Big Bird. This doesn't belong to you."
00:54:13.124,00:54:14.626,"Oh, God."
00:54:21.424,00:54:23.927,"-Suit lady, what was that?! SPIDER SUIT: You told me to choose."
00:54:24.928,00:54:27.472,"What? No, just set everything back to normal."
00:54:27.973,00:54:29.891,Activating all systems.
00:54:46.491,00:54:47.826,My head.
00:54:47.993,00:54:50.870,SPIDER SUIT: You appear to have a mild concussion.
00:54:52.998,00:54:56.167,"Hey, so where am I right now?"
00:54:56.334,00:54:57.460,I'm not sure.
00:54:58.003,00:55:00.171,The container walls are hindering my sensors.
00:55:01.881,00:55:03.216,Wait a minute.
00:55:03.383,00:55:06.928,They must have hijacked the truck and taken me to their evil lair.
00:55:07.429,00:55:10.849,"Okay, suit lady, we're gonna have to fight our way out of this one."
00:55:11.224,00:55:13.268,"Three, two, one."
00:55:19.816,00:55:21.526,What is this place?
00:55:21.693,00:55:22.944,"Suit lady, where am I?"
00:55:23.111,00:55:26.031,You're in the most secure facility on the Eastern Seaboard.
00:55:26.197,00:55:27.782,The Damage Control deep-storage vault.
00:55:27.949,00:55:31.161,No. Seriously? Argh!
00:55:33.496,00:55:35.790,The door will most likely remain closed until morning.
00:55:35.957,00:55:37.250,Morning?
00:55:37.417,00:55:42.505,"Hey, suit lady. I kind of feel bad calling you suit lady, you know?"
00:55:42.672,00:55:44.966,I think I should probably give you a name.
00:55:45.133,00:55:47.469,"Like Liz. No, no, no."
00:55:47.635,00:55:49.637,"God, that's-- That's weird."
00:55:49.804,00:55:52.182,What about Karen?
00:55:52.599,00:55:54.434,SPIDER SUIT: You can call me Karen if you would like.
00:55:54.601,00:55:57.729,"Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do?"
00:55:59.981,00:56:01.900,Maybe we should run that refresher course.
00:56:02.067,00:56:03.651,KAREN: Ricochet web. -Ricochet web.
00:56:03.818,00:56:07.280,-Whoa. Cool. -Splitter web.
00:56:08.448,00:56:11.326,-Web grenade. -Web grenade!
00:56:13.078,00:56:15.747,Should I tell Liz that I'm Spider-Man?
00:56:15.914,00:56:16.998,Who is Liz?
00:56:17.165,00:56:19.793,"Who's Liz? Heh. She's-- Heh, heh."
00:56:19.959,00:56:21.419,She's the best. She's awesome.
00:56:21.586,00:56:24.297,She's just a girl who goes to my school.
00:56:24.464,00:56:29.594,"And, uh-- Yeah, I just-- I really want to tell her, but it's kind of weird, you know?"
00:56:29.761,00:56:32.972,"Hey, I'm Spider-Man."
00:56:33.139,00:56:34.265,What's weird about that?
00:56:34.432,00:56:36.476,What if she's expecting someone like Tony Stark?
00:56:36.643,00:56:38.645,Imagine how disappointed she'd be when she sees me.
00:56:38.812,00:56:42.357,"Well, if I were her, I wouldn't be disappointed at all."
00:56:42.524,00:56:44.025,"Thanks, Karen."
00:56:44.192,00:56:46.945,It's really nice to have somebody to talk to.
00:56:47.112,00:56:48.947,"Hey, how long we been here anyways?"
00:56:49.114,00:56:50.990,-Thirty-seven minutes. -What?!
00:56:51.157,00:56:52.867,Thirty-seven minutes? That's insane.
00:56:53.034,00:56:56.704,I cannot take this anymore. I got to-- I gotta get out of here.
00:56:58.623,00:57:01.459,There's got to be something in here I can use.
00:57:02.502,00:57:04.254,"Okay, let's see."
00:57:04.420,00:57:05.964,Nope.
00:57:07.173,00:57:08.341,That's awesome.
00:57:08.550,00:57:10.051,Oh.
00:57:10.218,00:57:11.427,"Hey, it's like the glowy thing."
00:57:11.594,00:57:14.597,That glowy thing is an explosive Chitauri energy core.
00:57:14.764,00:57:16.766,"You mean, we've been carrying around a bomb?"
00:57:16.933,00:57:20.645,It would require radiation to transform it into an explosive state.
00:57:22.063,00:57:23.481,"No, no, no."
00:57:27.360,00:57:30.238,"Hey! Please! Please, somebody let me out! Hey!"
00:57:30.405,00:57:32.323,"Karen, you have to help me override that time lock."
00:57:33.074,00:57:35.076,"Okay, Karen, lower the voltage and run it."
00:57:35.243,00:57:36.744,Trial unsuccessful.
00:57:36.911,00:57:38.204,"Okay, we're just gonna have to try every sequence."
00:57:42.167,00:57:45.295,"LIZ: Ned, Peter, we're gonna be late. Come on, let's go."
00:57:45.462,00:57:47.672,"Okay. Uh, hold on, hold on."
00:57:51.551,00:57:54.637,Initiating trial 247.
00:57:55.180,00:57:56.556,It worked. It works.
00:58:09.027,00:58:12.614,Please be sure all cell phones are turned off.
00:58:12.780,00:58:13.823,Thank you.
00:58:13.990,00:58:15.867,"PETER: Karen, get me to decathlon as fast as possible."
00:58:16.034,00:58:17.160,KAREN: Sure thing. Just tell me where it is.
00:58:17.327,00:58:18.953,Across the street from the Washington Monument.
00:58:20.288,00:58:22.123,Call me back. The glowy thing's a bomb!
00:58:27.754,00:58:30.089,KAREN: There's a vehicle approaching on your right.
00:58:30.256,00:58:32.467,JUDGE: We have now entered sudden death.
00:58:32.634,00:58:35.428,The next correct answer wins the championship.
00:58:39.766,00:58:41.684,JUDGE: Midtown Tech?
00:58:41.851,00:58:43.478,Zero.
00:58:43.645,00:58:44.687,That is correct.
00:58:45.438,00:58:47.732,Midtown takes the championship.
00:58:47.941,00:58:51.236,"FLASH: Woo-hoo! We won. LIZ: You guys, I am so proud of you."
00:58:51.402,00:58:54.572,"FLASH: Told you we didn't need Peter. NED: Flash, you didn't answer a question."
00:58:54.739,00:59:00.203,"-Taking it all in, Michelle? -Oh, yeah, I just, um-- I don't want to celebrate something that was built by slaves."
00:59:00.370,00:59:07.335,I'm sure the Washington Monument wasn't built by-- Okay.
00:59:07.794,00:59:09.963,-Enjoy your book. -Thanks.
00:59:12.549,00:59:15.009,"-Oh, Ned, you're alive. -Peter, are you okay?"
00:59:15.176,00:59:16.761,Where's the glowy thing? The glowy thing?
00:59:16.928,00:59:20.515,"-It's safe. It's in my backpack. -Ned, listen, the glowy thing is dangerous."
00:59:20.682,00:59:22.267,You missed the decathlon. I covered for you.
00:59:22.433,00:59:24.352,-Listen. -We're at the Washington Monument.
00:59:24.519,00:59:25.895,"-Peter, is that you? -Hey, Liz."
00:59:26.062,00:59:27.480,KAREN: Is that Liz? -Put Ned back on the phone.
00:59:27.647,00:59:30.775,KAREN: You should tell her how you feel. -You flake. You are lucky we won.
00:59:30.942,00:59:34.529,"I want to be mad, but I'm more worried. Like, what is going on with you?"
00:59:34.696,00:59:36.197,I have to talk to Ned. It's important.
00:59:36.364,00:59:37.532,"All items on the belt, please."
00:59:37.699,00:59:38.700,PETER: There's something in Ned's backpack.
00:59:38.866,00:59:40.868,It's dangerous. Don't let it go through an x-ray.
00:59:43.788,00:59:45.957,Liz? Liz! Damn it.
00:59:49.460,00:59:51.754,Can I be the one to tell Peter he's expelled?
00:59:55.967,01:00:01.723,"The Washington Monument is 555 feet, five and one-eighth inches tall."
01:00:03.474,01:00:06.477,Notice how the marble and granite are cut around the stone.
01:00:13.901,01:00:16.321,"No, no, no. Karen, what's going on up there?"
01:00:17.322,01:00:18.823,KAREN: The Chitauri core has detonated...
01:00:18.990,01:00:20.992,...and caused severe structural damage to the elevator.
01:00:21.159,01:00:22.368,"-Oh, no. -My friends are up there."
01:00:22.535,01:00:25.079,"What? Uh, don't worry, ma'am, everything's gonna be okay."
01:00:25.246,01:00:27.332,"Excuse me, excuse me. Oh, my God, that's tall."
01:00:33.421,01:00:34.922,"Oh, my God. Look at the ceiling."
01:00:35.089,01:00:36.591,"LIZ: Just stay calm, everyone."
01:00:36.758,01:00:38.426,"Oh, we are all going to die here."
01:00:41.054,01:00:43.723,KAREN: Estimating 10 minutes before catastrophic failure.
01:00:43.890,01:00:45.391,We're freaking screwed.
01:00:45.558,01:00:48.686,"Okay, I know that was scary, but our safety systems are working."
01:00:48.853,01:00:51.272,KAREN: The safety systems are completely failing.
01:00:51.439,01:00:53.107,We're very safe in here.
01:00:53.274,01:00:55.860,KAREN: The occupants are in imminent mortal danger.
01:00:56.027,01:00:57.111,Going as fast as I can!
01:01:06.829,01:01:08.164,MAN 1: Let's go. MAN 2: Give me your hand.
01:01:09.582,01:01:11.876,KAREN: You now have 125 seconds until catastrophic failure.
01:01:12.043,01:01:13.086,What?! Why?
01:01:13.586,01:01:16.589,Unexpected motion has caused the deterioration to escalate.
01:01:16.756,01:01:20.218,-How do I get in there? -Activating reconnaissance drone.
01:01:22.178,01:01:24.972,Whoa. Has that been there this whole time? That's awesome.
01:01:25.431,01:01:27.684,Locating optimal entry point.
01:01:29.394,01:01:31.062,Proceed to southwest window.
01:01:31.229,01:01:32.980,"Karen, I'm on my way."
01:01:37.527,01:01:39.529,LIZ: There's a lot of glass here. MAN: You got this.
01:01:39.696,01:01:40.905,"Keep coming, keep coming."
01:01:54.961,01:01:56.963,"Okay. Oh, my God."
01:01:57.130,01:01:58.798,Okay.
01:02:00.466,01:02:02.510,KAREN: What's wrong? You've reached the southwest window.
01:02:02.677,01:02:04.429,-Why are you hesitating? -It's fine.
01:02:04.595,01:02:06.305,I've just never been this high before.
01:02:06.472,01:02:08.641,You have also not reinstalled your parachute...
01:02:08.808,01:02:11.519,...so a fall from this height would most likely be lethal.
01:02:11.728,01:02:12.979,Oh.
01:02:13.146,01:02:14.605,Perfect.
01:02:14.772,01:02:16.357,"Oh, my God."
01:02:17.900,01:02:19.026,Why is it not breaking?
01:02:19.193,01:02:22.864,It's four-inch ballistic glass. You'll have to create more momentum.
01:02:42.091,01:02:44.427,OFFICER 1: This is D.C. Metro Police. Identify yourself.
01:02:44.594,01:02:46.179,PETER: My friends are in there! Stop!
01:02:46.345,01:02:48.097,Return to the ground immediately.
01:02:48.264,01:02:50.266,"-Okay, who's next? FLASH: Me, it's my turn."
01:02:50.433,01:02:52.268,"NED: Flash, seriously? What are you doing?"
01:02:52.435,01:02:55.396,-Come on. LIZ: Don't worry about the trophy.
01:03:02.862,01:03:04.030,OFFICER 1: Stand down!
01:03:04.197,01:03:06.949,Return to the ground immediately.
01:03:11.120,01:03:13.122,Return to the ground or we will open fire!
01:03:13.289,01:03:15.124,"OFFICER 2: Go up, go up."
01:03:15.958,01:03:17.335,PETER: I got this.
01:03:17.502,01:03:19.170,Take my trophy.
01:03:21.005,01:03:23.216,OFFICER 1: This is your last chance.
01:03:23.382,01:03:25.426,PETER: I'm gonna die.
01:03:26.093,01:03:27.553,Look out!
01:03:34.268,01:03:35.728,Break!
01:03:49.325,01:03:50.993,I did it. Whoa!
01:04:09.720,01:04:11.806,"-Big guy, quit moving around. -I'm sorry, sir."
01:04:15.434,01:04:16.477,"MAN: Let's go, let's go!"
01:04:22.358,01:04:23.401,"Okay, okay."
01:04:23.568,01:04:25.528,"LIZ: Mr. Harrington, go. BOY: Ned, come on."
01:04:25.695,01:04:27.488,"PETER: This is your stop. -Come on, Liz."
01:04:27.655,01:04:30.575,"PETER: Go, go, go. Everybody out. Move it, people. Move it, move it."
01:04:30.741,01:04:32.243,LIZ: Are you sure it's safe? HARRINGTON: Liz.
01:04:33.160,01:04:34.370,PETER: Liz!
01:04:38.583,01:04:40.251,You're okay. You're okay.
01:04:43.754,01:04:45.131,Okay.
01:04:45.673,01:04:46.966,"LIZ: Oh, my God. -Good, good."
01:04:47.133,01:04:49.010,"Come on up. Come on, you guys, stay back."
01:04:49.176,01:04:51.178,MAN 1: Come on in. MAN 2: You guys good?
01:04:54.181,01:04:56.183,"KAREN: This is your chance, Peter."
01:04:56.350,01:04:58.185,Kiss her.
01:05:01.939,01:05:03.608,Thank you.
01:05:06.611,01:05:09.155,Are you really friends with Peter Parker?
01:05:16.120,01:05:21.000,"I can finish the next order, but without any new materials from that truck...."
01:05:21.584,01:05:23.753,"Yeah, damn it."
01:05:24.253,01:05:26.464,"We still have enough to do the Gargan deal though, right?"
01:05:26.631,01:05:28.633,"Yeah, but then that's it."
01:05:31.177,01:05:32.219,Oh.
01:05:32.386,01:05:34.847,Maybe it is time that I built the high-altitude seal.
01:05:35.014,01:05:36.599,-Would you shut up about that? -It's only one job.
01:05:36.766,01:05:38.267,No.
01:05:39.769,01:05:43.022,"Eight years, not a word from the feds, nothing from those..."
01:05:43.189,01:05:47.234,...Halloween-costume-wearing bozos up there in Stark Tower.
01:05:47.401,01:05:52.114,"And then all of a sudden, this little bastard in red tights shows up."
01:05:52.281,01:05:55.952,And he thinks he can tear down everything I've built.
01:05:57.453,01:05:58.996,Really?
01:06:00.164,01:06:01.332,I'm gonna kill him.
01:06:01.499,01:06:03.542,-I'm gonna find him-- -I found him.
01:06:05.169,01:06:08.089,...heroically saving an Academic Decathlon team from Queens.
01:06:08.756,01:06:11.467,The identity of the masked hero is still unknown.
01:06:13.928,01:06:16.472,"-Mom. WOMAN: Oh, kids. All right."
01:06:16.639,01:06:19.141,"Peter. Come here, come here, come here."
01:06:23.062,01:06:25.564,"This past weekend, Midtown's Academic Decathlon team..."
01:06:25.731,01:06:28.693,...defeated the country's best to win the national championship.
01:06:28.859,01:06:30.528,"Later that day, they also defeated death."
01:06:30.695,01:06:33.114,Explosion. Sally scream. Flash scream. Everybody screaming.
01:06:33.280,01:06:37.076,"There were purple lasers and smoke. It was **** tight, like a Bon Jovi concert."
01:06:37.243,01:06:40.621,"As you know, we made it out alive, and that's the important thing."
01:06:40.788,01:06:43.874,I couldn't bear to lose a student on a school trip.
01:06:45.126,01:06:46.168,Not again.
01:06:46.335,01:06:50.464,"Thankfully, no one was seriously injured thanks to the Spider-Man."
01:06:50.673,01:06:52.466,"-Thank you, Spider-Man. -Thank you, Spider-Man."
01:06:52.633,01:06:55.553,JASON: Up next: the Spider-Man mania is sweeping the school.
01:06:55.720,01:06:58.347,How can you show your spider spirit?
01:07:02.268,01:07:04.186,"Dude, dude, dude."
01:07:04.353,01:07:07.064,What is it like being famous when nobody knows it's you?
01:07:07.231,01:07:08.691,"-Crazy, dude. -It's crazy."
01:07:08.858,01:07:10.693,-Should we tell everyone? -No.
01:07:10.860,01:07:13.654,"-Should I tell everyone? -No, dude. That's not a good idea."
01:07:14.071,01:07:17.158,"-Okay, come on, we'll be late to class. -I'm not going to class."
01:07:17.324,01:07:19.076,You're already in trouble for ditching the decathlon.
01:07:19.243,01:07:20.786,"Dude, listen, I figured it out."
01:07:20.953,01:07:22.872,The wingsuit guy is stealing from Damage Control.
01:07:23.039,01:07:26.042,"What he takes from Damage Control, that's how he builds the weapons."
01:07:26.208,01:07:29.128,-So all I gotta do is catch him. -But we have a Spanish quiz.
01:07:29.295,01:07:31.505,"Ned, I'm probably never gonna come back here."
01:07:31.672,01:07:34.717,Mr. Stark is moving the Avengers upstate...
01:07:34.884,01:07:36.844,-...so when I bring this guy in-- -Dude.
01:07:37.011,01:07:38.929,You want to be a high school dropout?
01:07:39.096,01:07:41.766,I am so far beyond high school right now.
01:07:41.932,01:07:44.643,"Parker, my office."
01:07:47.313,01:07:48.939,So...
01:07:49.106,01:07:50.608,...you got detention.
01:07:50.775,01:07:52.943,You screwed up. You know what you did was wrong.
01:07:53.110,01:07:55.488,"The question is, how are you gonna make things right?"
01:07:55.654,01:07:56.822,Maybe you were trying to be cool.
01:07:57.531,01:08:00.201,But take it from a guy who's been frozen for 65 years...
01:08:00.367,01:08:03.496,...the only way to really be cool is to follow the rules.
01:08:04.497,01:08:07.124,We all know what's right. We all know what's wrong.
01:08:07.291,01:08:09.835,Next time those turkeys try to convince you of something...
01:08:10.002,01:08:12.254,-...you know is wrong... -Where you going? Get back here.
01:08:12.421,01:08:14.799,"...just think to yourself, what would Captain America do?"
01:08:14.965,01:08:16.759,Why are you here? You don't have detention.
01:08:16.926,01:08:20.513,"Oh, I know. I just like coming here to sketch people in crisis."
01:08:23.724,01:08:25.267,It's you.
01:08:25.768,01:08:29.522,"So your body's changing. Believe me, I know how that feels."
01:08:41.117,01:08:42.785,May?
01:08:46.288,01:08:47.331,"Hey, Karen. What's up?"
01:08:47.498,01:08:49.291,"KAREN: Hey, Peter. How was your Spanish quiz?"
01:08:49.458,01:08:50.543,I was wondering if you could help me.
01:08:50.709,01:08:53.212,I'm trying to figure out who the guys under the bridge were that night...
01:08:53.379,01:08:55.840,...but I can only remember part of a license plate.
01:08:56.006,01:08:58.801,I can run facial recognition on the footage of that encounter.
01:08:58.968,01:09:00.469,"-Footage? -Yes, Peter."
01:09:00.636,01:09:02.513,I record everything you see.
01:09:02.680,01:09:03.806,-Everything? -Everything.
01:09:03.973,01:09:06.308,-All the time? -It's called the Baby Monitor Protocol.
01:09:07.101,01:09:10.020,"Yeah, of course it is. Um...."
01:09:10.229,01:09:13.065,"-Yeah, just roll it back to last Friday. -With pleasure."
01:09:15.276,01:09:17.862,"Hey, what's up, Liz? Peter's told me a lot about you."
01:09:18.028,01:09:19.989,"No, no, no. This is just me messing around."
01:09:20.156,01:09:21.866,"Go later in the day, later in the day."
01:09:24.368,01:09:27.580,"No, no, no. That's definitely-- That's definitely not what we wanted to watch."
01:09:27.746,01:09:31.250,KAREN: Your impressions are funny. -Fast-forward to the arms deal.
01:09:31.417,01:09:32.710,Okay.
01:09:32.877,01:09:34.503,"The two on the right, who are they?"
01:09:34.670,01:09:36.380,KAREN: Searching law-enforcement databases.
01:09:37.256,01:09:39.258,No records found for two of the individuals.
01:09:39.425,01:09:41.510,-Nothing? KAREN: One individual identified.
01:09:41.677,01:09:43.804,"Aaron Davis, age 33."
01:09:43.971,01:09:46.807,He has a criminal record and an address here in Queens.
01:09:46.974,01:09:48.225,Let's pay him a visit.
01:09:48.392,01:09:51.729,KAREN: Would you like me to activate the Enhanced Interrogation Protocol?
01:09:51.896,01:09:52.980,"Uh, yeah."
01:10:10.122,01:10:11.957,I need information. You'll give it to me now.
01:10:12.124,01:10:13.834,"-All right, chill. -Come on!"
01:10:14.585,01:10:17.213,-What happened to your voice? -What do you mean?
01:10:17.379,01:10:19.465,I heard you by the bridge. I know what a girl sound like.
01:10:19.632,01:10:22.593,"I'm not a girl. I'm a boy. I mean, I'm a-- I'm a man."
01:10:22.760,01:10:26.430,"I don't care what you are, a boy, a girl-- I'm not a girl. I'm a man."
01:10:26.597,01:10:28.933,"Come on, man. Look, who is selling these weapons?"
01:10:29.308,01:10:31.393,I need to know. Give me names or else.
01:10:35.064,01:10:39.360,"-You ain't ever done this before, huh? -Deactivate Interrogation Mode."
01:10:42.446,01:10:45.157,These guys are selling weapons that are crazy dangerous.
01:10:45.324,01:10:46.742,They can't be out on the streets.
01:10:46.909,01:10:51.830,"If one of them can cut Delmar's Bodega in half-- -You know Delmar's? -Yeah, best sandwich in Queens."
01:10:51.997,01:10:54.208,"-Sub Haven's pretty good. -Eh, it's too much bread."
01:10:54.375,01:10:56.502,"-I like bread. -Come on, man, please."
01:10:58.837,01:11:01.548,"Stupid Interrogation Mode. Karen, don't ever do that again."
01:11:01.715,01:11:05.177,"The other night, you told that dude, If you shoot somebody, shoot me."
01:11:05.344,01:11:06.804,It's pretty ballsy.
01:11:06.971,01:11:09.014,I don't want those weapons in this neighborhood.
01:11:09.181,01:11:10.557,I got a nephew who live here.
01:11:11.767,01:11:13.018,Who are these guys?
01:11:13.185,01:11:15.104,What can you tell me about the guy with the wings?
01:11:15.271,01:11:17.523,"Other than he's a psychopath dressed like a demon, nothing."
01:11:17.690,01:11:19.650,I don't know who he is or where he is.
01:11:22.569,01:11:26.115,-I do know where he's gonna be. -Really?
01:11:26.282,01:11:28.534,"Yeah, this crazy dude I used to work with..."
01:11:28.701,01:11:31.120,...he's supposed to be doing a deal with him.
01:11:31.287,01:11:32.913,Yes! Yes.
01:11:33.080,01:11:34.665,-Thank-- -Hey. Hey. Hey.
01:11:34.832,01:11:37.126,I didn't tell you where. You don't have a location.
01:11:37.293,01:11:41.213,"Right, of course. Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just-- Yeah."
01:11:41.380,01:11:43.549,-Where is it? -Can I give you some advice?
01:11:43.757,01:11:46.760,-Hmm? -You gotta get better at this part of the job.
01:11:46.927,01:11:48.387,I don't understand.
01:11:48.554,01:11:49.930,I'm intimidating.
01:11:50.097,01:11:52.975,"-Staten Island Ferry, 11. -Oh, that's soon."
01:11:53.142,01:11:54.852,That's gonna dissolve in two hours.
01:11:55.019,01:11:57.604,"No, no, no. Come fix this."
01:11:57.771,01:11:59.440,-Two hours. You deserve that. -I got ice cream in here.
01:11:59.606,01:12:02.192,"You deserve that. You're a criminal. Bye, Mr. Criminal."
01:12:16.832,01:12:18.125,Nice.
01:12:21.420,01:12:24.048,"Okay, Karen, activate Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode."

01:12:25.632,01:12:27.760,"TOOMES: He's up front, main deck."
01:12:27.926,01:12:29.345,I hate this guy.
01:12:29.511,01:12:31.847,"It's the guy from the bridge, right? Who's that other guy?"
01:12:32.014,01:12:33.640,TOOMES: Just keep me posted.
01:12:33.807,01:12:35.684,KAREN: There's no record of him in my criminal database.
01:12:35.851,01:12:38.520,Incoming call from May Parker. Should I reroute to your heads-up display?
01:12:38.687,01:12:41.106,I can't talk right now. I'll call her back.
01:12:41.982,01:12:46.362,"Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy. We can't let anybody get away this time."

01:13:01.460,01:13:04.880,"No, Karen, stop it with the Instant Kill already."

01:13:55.139,01:13:56.306,"Uh, I'm in the middle of something."
01:13:56.473,01:13:57.850,Don't cut me off when I'm complimenting you.
01:13:58.016,01:14:03.772,"Anyway, great things are about to-- TONY: What is that? -Uh, I'm at band practice."
01:14:03.939,01:14:08.610,That's odd. Happy told me you quit band six weeks ago. What's up?

01:14:39.725,01:14:42.895,"I got to say, the other guy was way better with that thing."

01:20:34.788,01:20:37.040,...so you could sneak around behind my back...
01:20:37.207,01:20:41.211,-...doing the one thing I told you not to do. -Is everyone okay?
01:20:42.087,01:20:44.589,TONY: No thanks to you.
01:20:45.382,01:20:47.384,No thanks to me?
01:20:48.927,01:20:51.555,"Those weapons were out there, and I tried to tell you about it..."
01:20:51.721,01:20:53.098,...but you didn't listen.
01:20:53.265,01:20:56.685,None of this would've happened if you had just listened to me.
01:20:56.852,01:20:58.895,"If you even cared, you'd actually be here."
01:21:03.441,01:21:06.528,"I did listen, kid. Who do you think called the FBI, huh?"
01:21:06.903,01:21:09.281,Do you know I was the only one who believed in you?
01:21:09.447,01:21:13.243,Everyone else said I was crazy to recruit a 14-year-old kid.
01:21:13.410,01:21:15.704,"-I'm 15. -No, this is where you zip it, all right?"
01:21:15.871,01:21:18.456,The adult is talking. What if somebody had died tonight?
01:21:18.623,01:21:21.710,"Different story, right? Because that's on you."
01:21:21.877,01:21:23.211,And if you died...
01:21:23.378,01:21:25.589,...I feel like that's on me.
01:21:25.922,01:21:27.799,"-I don't need that on my conscience. -Yes, sir."
01:21:27.966,01:21:30.594,-I'm sorry. I understand. -Sorry doesn't cut it.
01:21:31.219,01:21:33.138,I just wanted to be like you.
01:21:33.305,01:21:34.848,And I wanted you to be better.
01:21:36.600,01:21:38.977,It's not working out. I'm gonna need the suit back.
01:21:39.144,01:21:41.354,-For how long? -Forever.
01:21:41.521,01:21:43.565,"-Yeah, that's how it works. -No, no. Please."
01:21:43.732,01:21:45.650,"-Let's have it. -Please, this is all I have."
01:21:45.817,01:21:47.193,I'm nothing without this suit.
01:21:47.944,01:21:50.363,"If you're nothing without this suit, then you shouldn't have it."
01:21:50.530,01:21:51.698,Okay?
01:21:51.865,01:21:54.075,"God, I sound like my dad."
01:21:56.119,01:21:57.996,I don't have any other clothes.
01:21:58.663,01:22:00.665,"Okay, we'll sort that out."
01:22:10.842,01:22:12.218,Hey.
01:22:17.015,01:22:20.352,I've been calling you all day. You didn't answer your phone.
01:22:20.518,01:22:21.978,You can't do that.
01:22:22.145,01:22:24.773,Then this ferry thing happens.
01:22:24.940,01:22:27.609,I've called five police stations.
01:22:27.776,01:22:28.985,Five.
01:22:29.152,01:22:30.946,I called five of your friends. I called Ned's mother.
01:22:31.112,01:22:34.741,"I'm fine. May, I'm okay. Honestly, just relax. I'm fine."
01:22:35.659,01:22:36.701,Cut the bullshit.
01:22:36.868,01:22:38.536,I know you left detention.
01:22:38.703,01:22:41.206,I know you left the hotel room in Washington.
01:22:41.373,01:22:43.291,I know you sneak out of this house every night.
01:22:43.458,01:22:44.751,That's not fine.
01:22:44.918,01:22:48.546,"Peter, you have to tell me what's going on. Just lay it out."
01:22:48.713,01:22:49.756,It's just me and you.
01:22:51.633,01:22:53.259,I lost the Stark internship.
01:22:53.843,01:22:55.428,-What? -Yeah.
01:22:55.887,01:22:57.013,What happened?
01:22:57.555,01:23:01.643,I just thought that I could work really hard and he could-- He would-- You know.
01:23:02.978,01:23:04.938,But I screwed it up.
01:23:05.105,01:23:06.898,"It's okay, it's okay."
01:23:08.608,01:23:10.235,It's okay.
01:23:11.111,01:23:13.530,I'm sorry I made you worry.
01:23:13.697,01:23:15.532,I'm not trying to ruin your life.
01:23:15.699,01:23:16.992,"Yeah, I know."
01:23:17.158,01:23:20.996,Just-- -I used to sneak out too. -Yeah.
01:23:23.999,01:23:26.167,And take a shower. You smell.
01:23:26.835,01:23:29.212,You smell like garbage.
01:23:29.379,01:23:31.006,I know.
01:23:34.050,01:23:36.386,"Peter, you're a good kid and you're a smart kid..."
01:23:36.553,01:23:39.180,"...so just try to keep your head straight, okay?"
01:23:39.806,01:23:41.266,Okay.
01:23:41.433,01:23:43.268,"All right, get out of here."
01:23:51.151,01:23:52.277,Are you expelled?
01:23:52.444,01:23:55.447,Do you have to go to that high school where the principal has a crossbow?
01:23:55.613,01:23:58.950,"Pretty sure that's an urban myth, and, no, I'm not expelled."
01:23:59.492,01:24:01.786,You're so lucky.
01:24:49.918,01:24:51.294,Hey.
01:24:51.461,01:24:54.589,-Hey. -I thought you had calculus fifth period.
01:24:54.756,01:24:57.133,"Yeah, I was just doing some homecoming stuff."
01:24:57.300,01:25:02.597,"Hey, look, I, uh-- I just wanted to apologize about the whole decathlon thing."
01:25:02.764,01:25:03.848,It's fine.
01:25:04.015,01:25:08.061,"Last week, decathlon was the most important thing, but then I almost died."
01:25:08.228,01:25:12.315,"No, I'm-- I just mean that..."
01:25:12.816,01:25:15.360,"...it was not cool, especially..."
01:25:17.112,01:25:18.863,...because...
01:25:20.115,01:25:22.700,...I like you.
01:25:23.201,01:25:24.702,I know.
01:25:27.330,01:25:28.373,You do?
01:25:29.040,01:25:31.167,You're terrible at keeping secrets.
01:25:31.334,01:25:33.002,"Yeah, you'd be surprised."
01:25:36.381,01:25:42.303,"I got to get to class, but, um-- I'd say we should hang out, but I'm gonna be in detention for..."
01:25:42.512,01:25:48.935,"-Uh-huh. -...ever, but, um-- I guess you already have a date to homecoming."
01:25:49.102,01:25:56.734,"Actually, I was so busy planning it, I never really got around to that part, so-- Uh, do you want to..."
01:25:56.901,01:25:57.944,...go with me?
01:25:58.903,01:26:00.738,Yeah. Sure.
01:26:00.905,01:26:03.533,"Really? I mean, uh, great. Cool."
01:26:03.908,01:26:05.326,Cool.
01:26:05.827,01:26:08.413,I'm actually going that way.
01:26:08.580,01:26:10.248,Um....
01:26:20.258,01:26:21.467,"May, I need your help."
01:26:37.901,01:26:39.736,Through or around?
01:26:44.741,01:26:45.992,-Right? -Heh-heh.
01:26:56.336,01:26:58.588,"MAY: It's game day. So, what's the plan?"
01:26:58.755,01:27:00.298,-Open the door for her. -Mm-hm.
01:27:00.465,01:27:02.884,"Tell her she looks nice, but not too much because that's creepy."
01:27:03.051,01:27:04.135,-Don't be creepy. -No.
01:27:04.302,01:27:06.971,"When I dance with her, I'm putting my hands on her hips."
01:27:07.138,01:27:08.890,I got this.
01:27:11.309,01:27:12.352,-Love you. -Bye.
01:27:27.242,01:27:28.868,You must be Peter.
01:27:29.702,01:27:30.828,Yeah.
01:27:30.995,01:27:32.538,I'm Liz's dad.
01:27:32.705,01:27:34.207,Put her there.
01:27:34.791,01:27:36.334,Hell of a grip.
01:27:36.501,01:27:38.795,Come on in here. Come on.
01:28:02.318,01:28:03.569,"Hi, Peter."
01:28:04.237,01:28:05.822,You look very handsome.
01:28:05.989,01:28:07.490,PETER: Thank you.
01:28:07.657,01:28:09.784,You got his name right?
01:28:09.951,01:28:11.327,-Freddie? -Peter.
01:28:11.494,01:28:12.704,-Peter. Peter. -Heh.
01:28:13.705,01:28:14.831,I'm gonna go get Liz.
01:28:15.248,01:28:16.791,Okay.
01:28:22.755,01:28:23.965,"You all right, Pete?"
01:28:24.132,01:28:25.258,Yeah.
01:28:25.633,01:28:28.011,Because you look pale.
01:28:29.846,01:28:31.306,You want something to drink?
01:28:31.472,01:28:33.725,"A bourbon or a Scotch, or something like that?"
01:28:33.891,01:28:35.184,I'm not old enough to drink.
01:28:35.727,01:28:37.145,That's the right answer.
01:28:39.272,01:28:40.273,Wow.
01:28:40.773,01:28:44.360,"-Wow, wow, wow. Do you look beautiful. -Please don't embarrass me, Dad."
01:28:44.527,01:28:45.945,"Doesn't she, Pete?"
01:28:46.112,01:28:48.489,"Yeah, you look really good."
01:28:48.656,01:28:50.867,"Once again, that's the right answer."
01:28:51.034,01:28:53.077,Is that a corsage?
01:28:54.829,01:28:56.331,Thanks.
01:28:56.497,01:28:59.709,"Well, hey, I'm your chauffeur, so, uh, let's get this show on the road."
01:28:59.876,01:29:03.046,"No, no, no, we have to take some pictures, babe. All right."
01:29:03.212,01:29:05.465,"-Oh, right here. Perfect. -Mom."
01:29:05.631,01:29:07.091,"Okay. Come on, you guys."
01:29:07.842,01:29:09.927,"Peter, closer."
01:29:11.179,01:29:12.555,Smile.
01:29:13.514,01:29:15.308,There you go.
01:29:15.892,01:29:17.018,Oh....
01:29:21.105,01:29:24.275,"-Sir, you don't have to drive us. -No, no, it's not a big deal."
01:29:24.442,01:29:26.652,I'm going out of town. It's right on my way.
01:29:26.819,01:29:28.738,-He's always going. Have fun. TOOMES: Last time.
01:29:28.905,01:29:30.281,LIZ: Thank you. TOOMES: Promise.
01:29:30.448,01:29:31.866,-He's cute. LIZ: Shh.
01:29:33.951,01:29:36.537,"-See you in a couple of days. All right. -Bye, baby."
01:29:36.704,01:29:38.289,"Come on, Pedro."
01:29:38.456,01:29:40.374,"-Bye, Peter. Have fun. PETER: Yeah, I will."
01:29:50.718,01:29:53.346,"TOOMES: What are you gonna do, Pete? -What?"
01:29:53.805,01:29:55.556,"When you graduate, what do you think you'll do?"
01:29:55.723,01:29:58.309,"-Oh, um, I don't know. -Don't grill him, Dad."
01:29:59.060,01:30:01.062,"Just saying, you know."
01:30:01.229,01:30:02.980,All you guys who go to that school...
01:30:03.147,01:30:05.566,"...you pretty much have your life planned out, right?"
01:30:06.109,01:30:08.277,"Yeah, no, I'm just a sophomore."
01:30:08.444,01:30:11.864,Peter has an internship with Tony Stark. I think he doesn't have to worry.
01:30:12.573,01:30:14.325,-Really? Stark? -Mm-hm.
01:30:14.492,01:30:16.202,So cool.
01:30:17.245,01:30:18.412,What do you do?
01:30:19.330,01:30:21.791,"Yeah, actually, I don't intern for him anymore."
01:30:21.958,01:30:24.961,"-Seriously? -Yeah, it got, um..."
01:30:25.128,01:30:26.170,...boring.
01:30:26.337,01:30:29.298,It was boring? You got to hang out with Spider-Man.
01:30:29.465,01:30:31.384,Really? Spider-Man?
01:30:32.009,01:30:34.428,Wow. What's he like?
01:30:35.513,01:30:37.056,"Yeah, he's nice."
01:30:37.223,01:30:39.058,Nice man.
01:30:39.225,01:30:41.060,Solid dude.
01:30:41.686,01:30:42.895,Hmm.
01:30:43.980,01:30:46.065,Look. So cute.
01:30:46.274,01:30:47.859,Aww....
01:30:51.445,01:30:53.656,"I've seen you around, right? I mean..."
01:30:54.407,01:31:00.037,"...somewhere. We've, uh-- Have we ever--? Because even the voice-- Um, he does Academic Decathlon with me."
01:31:00.246,01:31:02.623,-Oh. -And he was at my party.
01:31:02.790,01:31:05.168,"It was a great party, really great, yeah."
01:31:05.334,01:31:09.547,"-Beautiful house, a lot of windows. Heh. -You were there for, like, two seconds."
01:31:10.214,01:31:13.467,PETER: That was-- I was there longer than two seconds.
01:31:13.634,01:31:17.138,"LIZ: You disappeared. -No. No, I did not disappear."
01:31:17.305,01:31:21.475,"Yes, you did. You disappeared like you always do, like you did in D.C. too."
01:31:28.024,01:31:32.403,"Whew. That's terrible what happened down there in D.C., though."
01:31:32.570,01:31:34.197,Were you scared?
01:31:35.031,01:31:37.533,I'll bet you were glad when your old pal Spider-Man...
01:31:37.700,01:31:39.785,"...showed up in the elevator, though, huh?"
01:31:42.580,01:31:44.290,"Yeah, well, I actually didn't go up."
01:31:44.457,01:31:46.209,I saw it all from the ground.
01:31:47.210,01:31:48.544,LIZ: Yeah.
01:31:48.878,01:31:51.214,Very lucky that he was there that day.
01:31:54.258,01:31:56.928,Good old Spider-Man.
01:32:00.514,01:32:02.433,"Dad, the light."
01:32:17.823,01:32:20.034,Here we are. End of the line.
01:32:20.201,01:32:21.619,"Thanks, Dad."
01:32:22.078,01:32:23.621,"You head in there, gumdrop."
01:32:23.788,01:32:26.540,"I'm gonna give Peter the, uh, dad talk."
01:32:28.417,01:32:30.378,Don't let him intimidate you.
01:32:30.544,01:32:31.754,Love you.
01:32:31.921,01:32:34.382,"-Love you, gumdrop. LIZ: Have a safe flight."
01:32:34.548,01:32:35.758,LIZ: Hi.
01:32:36.801,01:32:39.095,You guys look so pretty.
01:32:43.933,01:32:44.976,Does she know?
01:32:46.018,01:32:47.311,Know what?
01:32:47.478,01:32:49.230,So she doesn't. Good.
01:32:49.397,01:32:51.065,Close to the vest.
01:32:51.232,01:32:52.400,I admire that.
01:32:52.566,01:32:54.694,I've got a few secrets of my own.
01:32:55.319,01:32:59.156,Of all the reasons I didn't want my daughter to date....
01:33:01.325,01:33:02.743,Peter...
01:33:02.910,01:33:05.121,...nothing is more important than family.
01:33:05.288,01:33:07.081,You saved my daughter's life.
01:33:07.248,01:33:09.083,I could never forget something like that.
01:33:09.250,01:33:11.002,So I'm gonna give you one chance.
01:33:11.168,01:33:12.295,Are you ready?
01:33:13.004,01:33:16.007,"You walk through those doors, you forget any of this happened..."
01:33:16.424,01:33:19.802,"...and don't you ever, ever..."
01:33:19.969,01:33:22.555,...interfere with my business again.
01:33:22.722,01:33:24.640,Because if you do...
01:33:24.807,01:33:27.059,...I'll kill you...
01:33:27.226,01:33:28.811,...and everybody you love.
01:33:30.062,01:33:31.897,I'll kill you dead.
01:33:32.064,01:33:34.859,That's what I'll do to protect my family. Do you understand?
01:33:36.777,01:33:38.195,Hey.
01:33:39.530,01:33:42.950,"I just saved your life. Now, what do you say?"
01:33:45.161,01:33:46.495,Thank you.
01:33:46.662,01:33:48.414,You're welcome.
01:33:48.581,01:33:54.128,"Now, you go on in there and you show my daughter a good time, okay?"
01:33:54.879,01:33:56.756,Just not too good.
01:34:50.434,01:34:51.477,Hey.
01:34:53.938,01:34:55.356,What did he say to you?
01:34:59.610,01:35:01.028,Gotta go.
01:35:02.947,01:35:04.573,I'm sorry.
01:35:04.949,01:35:06.867,You don't deserve this.
01:35:28.305,01:35:29.640,He gave you a choice.
01:35:29.807,01:35:31.892,-You chose wrong. -What the hell?
01:35:32.059,01:35:33.727,What's with the crappy costume?
01:35:36.147,01:35:37.356,My web-shooters.
01:35:46.282,01:35:50.870,"I wasn't sure about this thing at first, but damn."
01:35:55.249,01:35:57.418,Ugh. Gross.
01:36:09.346,01:36:11.849,PETER: Why did he send you here? -Guess you'll never know.
01:36:16.937,01:36:18.189,PETER: Nice shot!
01:36:23.527,01:36:24.653,Yes!
01:36:24.820,01:36:26.655,"Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz's dad."
01:36:26.822,01:36:28.699,-What? -I gotta tell Mr. Stark.
01:36:28.866,01:36:31.702,Call Happy Hogan. He's Mr. Stark's head of security.
01:36:31.869,01:36:33.078,Get a computer and track my phone.
01:36:33.496,01:36:35.247,"-Will you be okay? -Hurry, we gotta catch him..."
01:36:35.414,01:36:37.708,...before he leaves town.
01:36:37.875,01:36:40.085,I'm sorry about dinner...
01:36:40.503,01:37:02.441,"...but I know when branzino's fresh, and that was not fresh, okay? So-- Uh, sir, technically, this is my dad's car, sir. So I can't-- -Go for Ned. -Ned, I need you..."
01:37:02.650,01:37:04.944,"-...to track my phone. -Yeah, but where is it?"
01:37:09.907,01:37:12.284,"Genius move. Okay, he just passed the GameStop on Jackson Avenue."
01:37:12.451,01:37:15.663,"Hey, where are the headlights on this thing? I'm in Flash's car."
01:37:15.829,01:37:18.165,"-I'll pull the specs. -Okay, you're on speakerphone."
01:37:18.332,01:37:24.838,"-You stole Flash's car. Awesome. -Yeah, it's awesome. It's-- Get out of the way, get out of the way! Move!"
01:37:25.005,01:37:26.632,-Are you okay? -I've never driven before...
01:37:26.799,01:37:30.469,...only with May in parking lots. This is a huge step up.
01:37:32.471,01:37:33.889,"Hey, have you gotten through to Happy yet?"
01:37:34.056,01:37:37.393,Yeah. I'm working on it. I just gotta backdoor the phone system.
01:37:40.813,01:37:42.523,Guy in the chair.
01:37:49.196,01:37:51.365,-Hello? Hello? Who is this? -Uh....
01:37:51.532,01:37:52.575,"-Mr. Happy, it's Ned. -Who?"
01:37:52.741,01:37:56.745,I'm an associate of Peter Parker. Got something very important to tell you-- You gotta be shitting me.
01:37:57.454,01:37:58.497,Damn.
01:37:58.664,01:38:01.041,"Hey, Ned, how we coming on with those headlights?"
01:38:02.626,01:38:05.462,"Round knob to the left of the steering wheel, turn clockwise."
01:38:05.629,01:38:06.922,"Left, okay."
01:38:07.089,01:38:08.882,"Okay, perfect. So where's my phone now?"
01:38:09.091,01:38:10.259,Um....
01:38:10.467,01:38:12.052,He stopped in an old industrial park in Brooklyn.
01:38:12.219,01:38:15.014,What? That makes no sense. He said he was going out of town.
01:38:15.180,01:38:18.601,"NED: Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy. Don't think he likes you, by the way."
01:38:18.767,01:38:20.436,It sounded like he was catching a flight.
01:38:20.603,01:38:21.729,He said something about taking off in nine minutes.
01:38:21.895,01:38:23.897,-What? -He was surrounded by boxes.
01:38:24.064,01:38:25.608,Boxes? It's moving day.
01:38:25.774,01:38:27.735,It's moving day. He's gonna rob that plane.
01:38:27.901,01:38:29.778,I gotta stop him!
01:38:32.948,01:38:34.742,"HAPPY: All right, wheels up in eight minutes."
01:38:34.908,01:38:37.494,We just got to load Tony's old Hulkbuster armor...
01:38:37.661,01:38:44.126,"...prototype for Cap's new shield, and the Meging-- The Meg-- The-- Thor's magic belt."
01:38:45.461,01:38:48.130,"Okay, slow down. You're getting close. It's on your right."
01:38:48.297,01:38:49.548,-What? -Turn right.
01:38:59.391,01:39:01.685,-Peter. Are you okay? -Yeah.
01:39:01.852,01:39:04.271,Just keep trying to get through to Happy.
01:39:04.730,01:39:06.899,"It's been an honor, Spider-Man."
01:39:07.566,01:39:09.777,What are you doing here? There's a dance.
01:39:09.985,01:39:11.570,Uh....
01:39:13.572,01:39:14.615,I'm...
01:39:14.782,01:39:16.075,...looking...
01:39:16.241,01:39:18.410,...at porn.
01:39:56.699,01:39:57.741,Hey!
01:39:59.284,01:40:00.661,Surprised?
01:40:00.828,01:40:02.705,"Oh, hey, Pete."
01:40:03.414,01:40:04.707,I didn't hear you come in.
01:40:04.873,01:40:06.959,It's over. I've got you.
01:40:07.126,01:40:09.128,"You know, I gotta tell you, Pete..."
01:40:09.712,01:40:12.631,"...I really, really admire your grit."
01:40:14.216,01:40:15.384,I see why Liz likes you.
01:40:17.594,01:40:19.513,I do. When you first came to the house...
01:40:19.680,01:40:22.808,"...I wasn't sure. I thought, Really? But I get it now."
01:40:23.642,01:40:25.394,PETER: How could you do this to her?
01:40:25.561,01:40:27.563,"To her? I'm not doing anything to her, Pete."
01:40:27.730,01:40:30.065,I'm doing this for her.
01:40:30.274,01:40:31.608,Hm. Yeah.
01:40:35.654,01:40:37.114,Peter...
01:40:37.990,01:40:39.032,...you're young.
01:40:39.199,01:40:41.452,You don't understand how the world works.
01:40:41.618,01:40:44.371,But I understand that selling weapons to criminals is wrong.
01:40:44.538,01:40:47.291,How do you think your buddy Stark paid for that tower?
01:40:47.458,01:40:48.917,Or any of his little toys?
01:40:49.084,01:40:50.836,"Those people, Pete, those people up there..."
01:40:51.003,01:40:53.297,"...the rich and the powerful, they do whatever they want."
01:40:53.464,01:40:55.215,Guys like us...
01:40:55.382,01:40:57.259,...like you and me...
01:40:57.426,01:40:58.886,...they don't care about us.
01:40:59.052,01:41:01.513,"We build their roads, and we fight all their wars..."
01:41:01.680,01:41:03.974,"...and everything, but they don't care about us."
01:41:04.141,01:41:08.312,We have to pick up after them. We have to eat their table scraps.
01:41:09.563,01:41:11.565,That's how it is.
01:41:11.940,01:41:14.026,"I know you know what I'm talking about, Peter."
01:41:14.193,01:41:15.944,Why are you telling me this?
01:41:16.111,01:41:18.572,Because I want you to understand.
01:41:18.739,01:41:20.157,And...
01:41:20.324,01:41:23.327,...I needed a little time to get her airborne.
01:41:36.298,01:41:37.341,"I'm sorry, Peter."
01:41:40.677,01:41:44.473,What are you talking about? That thing hasn't even touched me yet.
01:41:44.932,01:41:47.184,True. Then again...
01:41:47.351,01:41:49.061,...wasn't really trying to.
01:41:54.817,01:41:56.443,"MASON: Chief, they're powering up engines."
01:41:56.610,01:41:59.446,"-Okay. Yeah, yeah. -Come on, come on, come on."
01:42:50.914,01:42:52.708,"Okay, ready?"
01:43:01.633,01:43:03.594,Hello?
01:43:05.971,01:43:07.431,Hello!
01:43:07.598,01:43:09.182,"Please, hey."
01:43:09.600,01:43:11.894,"Hey, please. I'm down here."
01:43:12.060,01:43:14.021,I'm down here. I'm stuck.
01:43:14.187,01:43:37.836,"I'm stuck. I can't move. I can't-- TONY: If you're nothing without this suit, then you shouldn't have it."
01:43:43.592,01:43:45.552,"Come on, Peter."
01:43:45.719,01:43:47.262,"Come on, Spider-Man."
01:43:47.429,01:43:49.389,"Come on, Spider-Man."
01:43:49.556,01:43:51.767,"Come on, Spider-Man."
01:43:53.644,01:43:56.021,"Come on, Spider-Man!"
01:44:47.197,01:44:48.699,Launch for intercept. Green light. Green light.
01:44:49.074,01:44:50.742,"Oh, yeah."
01:45:05.632,01:45:07.926,Retroreflective panels engaged.
01:45:19.938,01:45:22.858,"Got a visual on the plane, but I'm feeling a little resistance."
01:45:23.025,01:45:25.694,MASON: It's probably just drag on the new turbines.
01:45:38.415,01:45:41.585,Look out for the cloaking cameras. Stay in the blind spots.
01:45:51.094,01:45:52.846,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
01:45:53.180,01:45:55.599,Deploying high-altitude vacuum seal.
01:45:55.766,01:45:57.017,"This better work, Mason."
01:46:02.856,01:46:05.901,"MASON: Trust me, boss, even one of those boxes and we are set for life."
01:46:06.068,01:46:07.360,Yeah.
01:46:19.790,01:46:21.249,MASON: You have 30 seconds to get to the cockpit...
01:46:21.416,01:46:23.210,...and override their security.
01:46:34.763,01:46:36.306,Cloning transponder signal.
01:46:36.473,01:46:38.141,Launching decoy drone.
01:46:39.601,01:46:41.186,Whoa.
01:46:42.270,01:46:44.397,Entering new coordinates.
01:46:50.403,01:46:51.571,"HAPPY: Good, so it's on its way."
01:46:51.738,01:46:54.574,"MAN: Yes, sir, right on course. -Okay, thank you."
01:46:55.408,01:46:56.827,All right.
01:47:09.339,01:47:10.966,Hot dog.
01:48:00.599,01:48:02.434,Just a typical homecoming...
01:48:02.601,01:48:05.312,...on the outside of an invisible jet...
01:48:06.021,01:48:07.731,...fighting my girlfriend's dad. Oh!
01:48:17.282,01:48:18.366,"Oh, God!"
01:48:25.957,01:48:28.043,I can't believe that worked. Whoa!
01:49:04.537,01:49:06.790,"Chief, they're losing altitude. Get out of there."
01:49:06.957,01:49:08.083,I'm not going home empty-handed.
01:49:18.385,01:49:20.178,"Oh, my God."
01:49:34.693,01:49:37.529,"MASON: Get out. What are you doing? -Please turn, please turn!"
01:51:12.499,01:51:14.209,"Hey, Pedro."
01:52:01.631,01:52:02.674,Bingo.
01:52:18.857,01:52:20.650,Your wingsuit.
01:52:20.817,01:52:22.902,Your wingsuit's going to explode!
01:52:30.285,01:52:31.744,"Time to go home, Pete."
01:52:31.911,01:52:33.371,I'm trying to save you!
01:52:48.595,01:52:49.971,No.
01:52:50.638,01:52:52.182,No.
01:54:31.739,01:54:35.159,"It looked so insane. That whole-- Like, it was just crazy."
01:54:35.326,01:54:39.873,"He-- He was just, like: -And you were like, Aah! -Shh."
01:54:40.039,01:54:41.916,And then I just hit him with the: whoosh.
01:54:42.083,01:54:43.960,"It was so-- Oh, my God."
01:54:44.127,01:54:46.129,"I mean, you saved me."
01:54:46.462,01:54:48.089,It was awesome.
01:54:54.053,01:54:55.805,"Hey, Liz."
01:54:57.307,01:54:58.474,I'm gonna miss you.
01:54:58.975,01:55:00.560,Bye.
01:55:01.185,01:55:02.645,PETER: Liz.
01:55:09.485,01:55:10.695,"Liz, look, I'm so sorry."
01:55:11.738,01:55:14.741,You say that a lot. What are you sorry for this time?
01:55:16.159,01:55:17.201,The dance?
01:55:18.536,01:55:21.289,"That, um, was a pretty crappy thing to do."
01:55:21.706,01:55:25.793,"Well, yeah, but I-- I mean, your dad-- I can't imagine what you're going through."
01:55:25.960,01:55:28.129,If there's anything I can do to help....
01:55:28.296,01:55:30.798,I guess we're moving to Oregon.
01:55:30.965,01:55:34.218,"Mom says it's nice there, so that's cool."
01:55:35.053,01:55:39.223,"Anyways, Dad doesn't want us here during the trial. So...."
01:55:40.642,01:55:45.146,"Liz, I-- I-- Bye, Peter."
01:55:46.022,01:55:49.525,"Whatever's going on with you, I hope you figure it out."
01:56:02.038,01:56:05.583,"Congratulations, decathlon national champions."
01:56:05.750,01:56:07.794,-Yeah! -Ha-ha.
01:56:07.961,01:56:10.380,I'll have to put this back in the trophy case soon...
01:56:10.546,01:56:13.049,...but just for motivation right now at this practice.
01:56:13.216,01:56:14.884,"I'm ahead of the game, but we will need..."
01:56:15.051,01:56:16.594,...a new team captain next year.
01:56:16.761,01:56:19.430,So I am appointing Michelle.
01:56:20.431,01:56:22.100,Yeah!
01:56:24.310,01:56:25.520,"Uh, thank you."
01:56:25.687,01:56:27.146,My-- My friends call me MJ.
01:56:27.772,01:56:29.816,I thought you didn't have any friends.
01:56:29.983,01:56:31.901,I didn't.
01:56:36.781,01:56:38.783,"-I, uh, gotta go. -Hey, where you going?"
01:56:41.494,01:56:43.621,"What are you hiding, Peter?"
01:56:45.915,01:56:47.500,I'm just kidding. I don't care. Bye.
01:56:47.667,01:56:50.336,"-All right, so we should run some drills. NED: Yeah."
01:56:58.761,01:57:02.098,"Hey, Happy. What, uh--? What are you doing here?"
01:57:03.057,01:57:04.308,I really owe you one.
01:57:06.394,01:57:08.688,I don't know what I would do without this job.
01:57:08.855,01:57:42.472,"I mean, before I met Tony-- So, uh, how long you been here?"
01:57:42.638,01:57:44.807,Long enough to be awkward. Boss wants to see you.
01:57:50.855,01:57:52.440,"Yeah, let's go."
01:57:53.816,01:57:54.942,Take a look.
01:57:55.109,01:57:57.153,"It's pretty impressive, huh?"
01:57:58.237,01:58:00.990,They just finished remodeling the whole thing.
01:58:27.225,01:58:30.269,"-You don't see that every day. -Oh, there they are."
01:58:30.937,01:58:32.563,How was the ride up?
01:58:32.980,01:58:35.608,-Good. -Give me a minute with the kid.
01:58:36.359,01:58:38.194,-Seriously? -Yeah.
01:58:38.611,01:58:39.987,I gotta talk to the kid.
01:58:40.571,01:58:41.656,I'll be close behind.
01:58:41.823,01:58:45.576,How about a loose follow? All right? Boundaries are good.
01:58:50.581,01:58:51.791,Sorry I took your suit.
01:58:51.958,01:58:54.460,"You had it coming. Actually, it turns out it was..."
01:58:54.627,01:58:56.629,...the perfect tough-love moment that you needed.
01:58:56.796,01:58:59.632,"To urge you on, right? Wouldn't you think? Don't you think?"
01:58:59.799,01:59:01.592,-I guess. -Let's just say it was.
01:59:03.469,01:59:06.681,"-Mr. Stark, I really-- -You screwed the pooch hard, bigtime."
01:59:07.306,01:59:08.975,But then you did the right thing.
01:59:09.142,01:59:12.311,"Took the dog to the free clinic, you raised the hybrid puppies...."
01:59:12.478,01:59:14.355,"All right, not my best analogy."
01:59:15.565,01:59:17.483,I was wrong about you.
01:59:18.025,01:59:20.278,"I think, with a little more mentoring..."
01:59:20.444,01:59:22.905,...you could be a real asset to the team.
01:59:24.699,01:59:26.534,-To the--? To the team? -Yeah. Anyway...
01:59:26.701,01:59:29.745,"...there's about 50 reporters behind that door. Real ones, not bloggers."
01:59:30.246,01:59:32.081,When you're ready...
01:59:32.456,01:59:34.167,...why don't you try that on?
01:59:34.333,01:59:40.089,And I'll introduce the world to the newest official member of the Avengers: Spider-Man.
01:59:42.550,01:59:43.551,I....
01:59:45.803,01:59:48.055,"TONY: Yeah, give that a look."
01:59:53.561,01:59:55.730,"After the press conference, Happy will show you to your room..."
01:59:55.897,01:59:56.981,...your new quarters.
01:59:57.148,01:59:59.400,Where's he between? He's next to Vision?
01:59:59.567,02:00:01.819,"-Yeah, Vision's not big on doors. -It's fun."
02:00:01.986,02:00:03.321,Or walls.
02:00:03.487,02:00:05.364,You'll fit right in.
02:00:11.787,02:00:13.789,"Thank you, Mr. Stark."
02:00:14.248,02:00:15.499,But I'm good.
02:00:16.542,02:00:19.045,You're good? Good--? How are you good?
02:00:19.212,02:00:23.382,"Well, I mean, I'd rather just stay on the ground for a little while."
02:00:23.549,02:00:25.718,Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.
02:00:25.885,02:00:27.845,"Somebody's got to look out for the little guy, right?"
02:00:28.304,02:00:29.764,You're turning me down?
02:00:29.931,02:00:32.016,You better think about this. Look at that.
02:00:32.183,02:00:33.434,Look at me.
02:00:34.185,02:00:35.269,Last chance. Yes or no?
02:00:35.436,02:00:36.729,-No. -Okay.
02:00:36.896,02:00:40.399,"It's kind of a Springsteen-y, working-class hero vibe that I dig."
02:00:40.566,02:00:42.568,"Uh, Happy will take you home."
02:00:42.735,02:00:44.237,-Yeah? -Yeah.
02:00:44.403,02:00:46.572,Mind waiting in the car? I need a minute.
02:00:48.115,02:00:50.785,"-Thank you, Mr. Stark. -Yes, Mr. Parker, very well."
02:00:50.952,02:00:52.662,-See you around. -Okay.
02:01:00.878,02:01:02.088,"That was a test, right?"
02:01:02.880,02:01:05.341,"-There's nobody back there? -Yes, you passed."
02:01:06.217,02:01:09.095,"-All right, skedaddle there, young buck. -Thank you, Mr. Stark."
02:01:09.262,02:01:10.972,"TONY: Yeah, thank you."
02:01:13.057,02:01:14.934,Told you he's a good kid.
02:01:21.190,02:01:22.650,-Where's the kid? -He left.
02:01:22.817,02:01:25.736,-Everybody's waiting. -He actually made a mature choice.
02:01:25.903,02:01:28.906,-It just surprised the heck out of us. -Did you screw this up?
02:01:29.073,02:01:31.158,-He told the kid to go wait in the car. -Are you kidding?
02:01:31.325,02:01:33.494,I have a room full of people in there waiting...
02:01:33.661,02:01:35.454,...for some big announcement. What will I tell them?
02:01:35.621,02:01:38.124,"Think of something. How about, um...?"
02:01:38.666,02:01:40.835,"-Hap, you still got that ring? -Do I--? I--?"
02:01:41.002,02:01:42.169,-The engagement ring. -Are you kidding?
02:01:42.336,02:01:45.548,I've been carrying this since 2008.
02:01:48.217,02:01:49.343,Okay.
02:01:49.510,02:01:51.095,I think I can think of something better than that.
02:01:51.262,02:01:53.639,"Well, it would buy us a little time."
02:01:54.932,02:01:57.059,Like we need time.
02:01:57.226,02:01:58.894,PEPPER: I can't believe you have that in your pocket.
02:01:59.061,02:02:01.564,"-Want me to get the door for you, hon? -I got it."
02:02:17.747,02:02:20.207,"PETER: Aunt May, did you do dinner already?"
02:02:30.468,02:02:32.136,May?
02:02:53.908,02:02:54.950,What the fu--?!
02:05:09.043,02:05:11.003,GARGAN: Look who it is.
02:05:12.922,02:05:16.091,What are the odds you and I'd end up at the same summer camp?
02:05:16.258,02:05:17.551,Relax.
02:05:18.177,02:05:20.179,This? It's not on you.
02:05:20.346,02:05:23.432,"It's on our, uh, little spider friend."
02:05:23.599,02:05:27.186,I've got some boys on the outside who would love to meet him.
02:05:27.353,02:05:30.814,"You know, take a picture, slice his throat, put his head in a dryer."
02:05:31.357,02:05:33.609,And I heard a rumor.
02:05:36.862,02:05:38.447,You know who he is.
02:05:42.201,02:05:44.537,If I knew who he was...
02:05:44.703,02:05:46.288,...he'd already be dead.
02:05:50.834,02:05:53.712,"Toomes, your family's here!"
02:12:32.819,02:12:35.656,"Hi, I'm Captain America, here to talk to you..."
02:12:35.822,02:12:39.785,...about one of the most valuable traits a soldier or student can have.
02:12:39.952,02:12:41.620,Patience.
02:12:41.787,02:12:43.914,Sometimes patience is the key to victory.
02:12:44.081,02:12:46.124,Sometimes it leads to very little...
02:12:46.291,02:12:48.627,...and it seems like it's not worth it.
02:12:48.794,02:12:50.295,And you wonder...
02:12:50.462,02:12:54.299,...why you waited so long for something so disappointing.
02:12:58.011,02:13:00.013,How many more of these?
