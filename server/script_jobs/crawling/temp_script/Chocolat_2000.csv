00:01:32.301,00:01:33.343,"Bonjour, monsieur."
00:01:46.648,00:01:53.196,"there was a quiet, little village in the French countryside, whose people believed in tranquillité."
00:01:55.490,00:01:56.658,Tranquility.
00:02:00.579,00:03:02.391,"Creator come From thy bright heavenly throne Come take possession of our souls And make them all thine own Far from us drive our… And through all… Lead us safe, beneath thy… This is, of course, a time of abstinence."
00:03:03.433,00:03:06.353,"Hopefully, also, a time of reflection."
00:03:07.813,00:03:14.569,"Above all, let this be for us a time… …a time of sincere penitence."
00:03:20.701,00:03:30.669,"if you saw something you weren't supposed to see, When you reflect, he knows what you reflect on."
00:03:33.839,00:03:34.840,what you abstain from.
00:03:52.357,00:03:55.193,the villagers held fast to their traditions.
00:03:56.319,00:04:02.617,"Until one winter day, a sly wind blew in from the north."
00:04:13.962,00:04:15.547,Where do we start looking?
00:05:20.654,00:05:22.239,Who the hell are you?
00:05:28.745,00:05:29.955,We'd like to rent it.
00:05:30.705,00:05:33.667,-And the apartment above. -Where are you from?
00:05:34.251,00:05:37.337,"Well, we lived in, uh, Andalusia for a while."
00:05:40.340,00:05:46.096,"Before that, um, Vienna and before that… -Before that-- -…Athens."
00:05:46.179,00:05:47.514,"-Pavia. -Pavia, yes."
00:05:48.348,00:05:49.891,Pantoufle hated it there.
00:05:50.433,00:05:53.478,-Pantoufle is her kangaroo. -But he can't hop.
00:05:54.271,00:05:56.565,"Bad leg. War injury, yeah?"
00:06:14.040,00:06:16.918,I'll expect you to keep it in good condition.
00:06:38.940,00:06:40.108,It's a lovely town.
00:06:42.569,00:06:46.031,"Mama, Pantoufle wants to know how long we can stay."
00:06:46.656,00:06:49.034,"Oh, tell Pantoufle not to worry."
00:06:54.164,00:06:56.541,Pantoufle wants to hear about Grandmère and Grandpère.
00:07:03.423,00:07:05.550,Tell about Grandmère and Grandpère.
00:07:08.762,00:07:10.931,How about The Princess and the Pirates?
00:07:14.476,00:07:18.605,Prepare to fire! All hands on deck!
00:07:19.314,00:07:22.859,"Ready, aim, fire!"
00:07:37.874,00:07:41.252,-What is your name? -Anouk. What's yours?
00:07:41.753,00:07:44.297,I am the Comte de Reynaud at your service.
00:07:46.424,00:07:48.176,Like the Comte de Monte Cristo?
00:07:48.635,00:07:50.804,Uh-huh. He was not a real one.
00:07:50.887,00:07:53.264,To what do we owe the honor of your visit?
00:07:53.807,00:08:02.107,"Well, as Mayor of Lansquenet, I want to welcome you to the community and to invite you to worship with us at mass on Sunday."
00:08:02.691,00:08:05.360,"That's very kind of you, but actually we don't attend."
00:08:08.613,00:08:10.657,"We're glad to be so near the church, though."
00:08:11.241,00:08:13.243,"We'll enjoy singing with the bells, won't we, Nou-Nou?"
00:08:13.410,00:08:16.913,"Uh. The bells are not intended as an entertainment, madame."
00:08:21.001,00:08:21.918,I beg your pardon?
00:08:22.502,00:08:26.506,"Mademoiselle. I've never been married, but feel free to call me Vianne."
00:08:29.467,00:08:32.387,I do hope you'll stop by when I open for business next week.
00:08:33.430,00:08:34.347,Yes.
00:08:35.682,00:08:39.019,"Yes, opening a patisserie during the Holy Lenten fast."
00:08:39.102,00:08:40.603,I could imagine better timing.
00:08:40.979,00:08:42.981,But it's not going to be a patisserie.
00:08:43.732,00:08:46.067,-Then what do you intend to-- -It's a surprise.
00:08:47.152,00:08:49.112,It was sweet of you to drop by.
00:09:01.124,00:09:03.626,"and therefore, a patient man."
00:09:09.007,00:09:12.719,"Like his ancestors, -he watched over the little village… -Bonjour."
00:09:15.680,00:09:20.727,"Hard work, modesty… self-discipline."
00:09:34.032,00:09:36.076,I have completed the 18th century.
00:09:38.828,00:09:44.959,"Madame Clairmont… Your letter to the editor, Monsieur le Comte."
00:09:45.251,00:09:50.256,This paragraph about family and tradition it's… it's beautiful.
00:10:07.816,00:10:09.275,with your mother recently?
00:10:12.278,00:10:14.364,She seems to have rented out the patisserie.
00:10:16.533,00:10:20.537,"Well, I haven't… talked to my mother in quite a while."
00:10:20.870,00:10:22.622,"Oh, I'm sorry. I did not mean to pry."
00:10:22.914,00:10:24.666,"Oh, don't be silly."
00:10:25.625,00:10:27.085,I have no secrets from you.
00:10:32.173,00:10:34.843,"The Comtesse? Oh, she's fine, thank you."
00:10:36.261,00:10:38.179,"Yes, yes, she's enjoying it very much."
00:10:40.390,00:10:41.266,Venice.
00:10:52.777,00:10:54.821,I heard she was some kind of radical.
00:11:39.407,00:11:40.325,Come on.
00:12:35.129,00:12:36.422,You should be more careful!
00:12:42.262,00:12:44.889,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Do you want to come in and sit down?"
00:12:50.228,00:12:51.688,Caroline Clairmont.
00:12:51.771,00:12:54.065,I'm the daughter of your landlady. This is my son Luc.
00:12:59.195,00:13:00.071,Try this.
00:13:00.780,00:13:04.826,"I bet you've never had hot chocolate made from a 2,000-year-old recipe."
00:13:05.326,00:13:07.036,"Thank you, but no. Luc?"
00:13:07.787,00:13:08.705,No.
00:13:11.916,00:13:15.336,"-What's this? -What do you see, madame, in this?"
00:13:18.631,00:13:21.134,Just say the first thing that comes into your mind.
00:13:24.429,00:13:28.016,Um. A… a woman riding a wild horse?
00:13:30.476,00:13:33.146,"-Silly answer. -Oh, no, there are no silly answers."
00:13:33.229,00:13:35.106,"The pepper triangle, that's for you."
00:13:35.732,00:13:40.320,A tiny hint of chili pepper to play against the sweetness.
00:13:40.862,00:13:42.572,"Tangy, adventurous."
00:13:52.498,00:13:53.875,What do you see?
00:13:57.170,00:13:58.379,I see teeth.
00:13:59.589,00:14:03.509,I see blood… and a skull.
00:14:06.929,00:14:08.139,Very dark.
00:14:08.264,00:14:10.224,Bitter chocolate. That's your favorite.
00:14:11.726,00:14:15.605,Uh. Which will have to wait five weeks more. Lent. Thank you.
00:14:16.564,00:14:18.816,-Oh. -We must run along.
00:14:18.900,00:14:20.610,It's been nice to meet you. Come.
00:14:22.070,00:14:22.987,My pleasure.
00:14:26.699,00:14:29.744,"How much are those chili things, please?"
00:14:34.791,00:14:36.834,-they are from my husband. -Of course.
00:14:44.801,00:14:46.469,She waltzes to her own tune.
00:14:48.971,00:14:51.349,And these are for your husband.
00:14:52.517,00:14:56.396,Unrefined cocoa nips from Guatemala. To awaken the passions.
00:14:58.815,00:15:01.067,You've obviously never met my husband.
00:15:01.859,00:15:03.945,"Well, you've obviously never tried these."
00:15:55.746,00:15:58.249,You've got a tiny error in problem six. Oh!
00:16:07.800,00:16:17.560,"Mother… I didn't tell you how to correct the mistake, I just told you that you made one."
00:16:18.644,00:16:19.812,Come.
00:17:39.517,00:17:41.269,"The Lenten fast, Madame Rivet."
00:17:42.019,00:17:43.938,Are you not supposed to eat something?
00:17:46.899,00:17:48.150,"It's all right, leave it."
00:18:49.003,00:18:50.004,May I help you?
00:18:52.256,00:18:54.091,It's expensive. I don't waste money.
00:18:55.676,00:18:57.845,I have a knack for guessing people's favorites.
00:19:00.765,00:19:03.309,These are your favorites. Am I right?
00:19:04.727,00:19:25.831,"-On the house. -I think I'd better… Yes, very different."
00:19:30.795,00:19:32.320,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
00:19:33.547,00:19:35.049,"Bonjour, Monsieur Blérot."
00:19:35.966,00:19:37.093,"Bonjour, Madame Audel."
00:19:57.697,00:19:58.739,"Come on, boy."
00:19:59.490,00:20:00.616,I've got something for you.
00:20:07.456,00:20:08.457,What's your name?
00:20:08.541,00:20:13.212,Charly. He's 14 years old. That's 98 in human years.
00:20:15.965,00:20:18.467,"Oh, uh, Guillaume Blérot."
00:20:19.009,00:20:22.138,You're very kind. He has so few pleasures left.
00:20:28.644,00:20:31.105,something special for your lady friend?
00:20:32.148,00:20:33.274,Lady friend?
00:20:33.357,00:20:36.110,Mm-hmm. The lovely woman your dog was so fond of.
00:20:38.654,00:20:41.490,Her favorite is chocolate seashells. That's my guess.
00:20:42.032,00:20:44.034,"No, I mustn't."
00:20:45.119,00:20:47.288,Madame Audel is in mourning for her husband.
00:20:47.872,00:20:49.331,"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:20:50.040,00:20:51.500,Wh-- When did he pass away?
00:20:55.421,00:20:56.338,Hmm.
00:20:56.964,00:21:01.218,"Well, it's been 15 years since the war, -so surely-- -Not that war."
00:21:02.011,00:21:04.680,"Monsieur Audel was killed on January the 12th, 1917."
00:21:06.307,00:21:08.267,It was quite a blow to Madame Audel.
00:21:09.435,00:21:10.561,"Apparently, so."
00:21:11.687,00:21:12.730,-Hmm. -Hmm.
00:21:17.061,00:21:19.069,"-Bonjour, Monsieur le Comte. -Bonjour, Monsieur le Comte."
00:21:24.492,00:21:27.536,"I wish all my tenants were as reliable as you, Madame Drou."
00:21:30.039,00:21:32.166,How is the Comtesse enjoying Italy?
00:21:33.751,00:21:34.668,Uh.
00:21:42.802,00:21:45.763,Have either of you seen the new shop across the square?
00:21:46.388,00:21:48.224,"Oh, the chocolaterie? Yes."
00:21:48.724,00:21:50.434,"Shameless, isn't it?"
00:21:52.812,00:21:59.318,The sheer nerve of the woman… opening a chocolaterie just in time for Lent.
00:22:01.403,00:22:02.446,The woman is brazen.
00:22:04.490,00:22:08.786,"My heart goes out to that poor, illegitimate child of hers."
00:22:10.704,00:22:11.705,Hmm.
00:22:19.505,00:22:46.815,"You ain't nothin' but a hound dog Cryin' all the time You ain't nothin' but a hound dog Cryin' all the time Well, you ain't never caught no rabbit You ain't no friend of mine How long have you been with us, Père Henri?"
00:22:47.324,00:22:50.160,"It will be, uh, five weeks."
00:22:50.244,00:22:55.165,"Your predecessor, Père Michel, he was with us for five decades."
00:22:56.083,00:23:00.963,"Yes, well, I only pray I can live up to Père Michel's example."
00:23:01.046,00:23:02.423,"Yes, that's my prayer also."
00:23:04.258,00:23:08.178,"I looked at your sermon, as you requested. I've made one or two notes."
00:23:13.225,00:23:14.310,You're very kind.
00:23:17.146,00:23:18.606,"Oh, uh, one more thing, um."
00:23:20.441,00:23:24.403,"If you haven't seen the new chocolaterie, perhaps you might like to take a look."
00:23:25.404,00:23:27.156,It's important to know one's enemy.
00:23:28.198,00:23:29.199,Don't you think?
00:23:46.467,00:23:50.220,"What's the decor, early Mexican brothel?"
00:23:50.304,00:23:51.221,Hmm?
00:24:00.814,00:24:03.484,"No! If I need help, I'll ask for it."
00:24:11.533,00:24:13.327,What do you see in it?
00:24:13.410,00:24:14.453,Not a damn thing.
00:24:14.995,00:24:16.372,Come on. It's a game.
00:24:17.539,00:24:18.540,What do you see?
00:24:19.667,00:24:22.836,"I see a cranky, old woman, too tired to play games."
00:24:22.920,00:24:25.255,Hmm. I've got just the thing for you.
00:24:31.762,00:24:33.013,Mind what?
00:24:33.097,00:24:35.349,The way you move her from place to place.
00:24:35.432,00:24:39.103,"Oh, she's doing fine. I think it's good for her."
00:24:39.853,00:24:43.023,"You know, seeing new places, meeting new people."
00:24:47.444,00:24:48.821,Your cinnamon looks rancid.
00:24:50.072,00:24:53.075,"Well, it's not cinnamon. It's a special kind of chili pepper."
00:24:58.247,00:24:59.164,Here.
00:25:19.268,00:25:24.189,It tastes like… I don't know.
00:25:40.998,00:25:49.531,-Stop it! -Don't you see? This is… Anouk… We do not strike one another!
00:26:01.101,00:26:02.394,Where's Pantoufle?
00:26:03.103,00:26:03.979,Shh!
00:26:06.398,00:26:08.358,My mother says you don't have a father.
00:26:09.902,00:26:12.321,"Sure, I do. We just don't know who he is."
00:26:14.948,00:26:16.658,I was out all night with him.
00:26:17.868,00:26:19.536,We swam naked in the Tannes.
00:26:21.663,00:27:00.702,"At dawn, when I returned to my house in my bed, my mother poked her head in and said, Perhaps you should give it to my daughter. Melt that chilly disposition of hers."
00:27:01.703,00:27:03.372,You and Caroline have a problem?
00:27:04.706,00:27:05.916,Do we have a problem?
00:27:08.127,00:27:10.379,She won't let me see my grandson.
00:27:11.296,00:27:12.631,I'm cut off from him.
00:27:16.510,00:27:17.803,"Armande, why is that?"
00:27:19.888,00:27:21.390,"Well, I'm a bad influence."
00:27:22.891,00:27:26.270,'Cause I don't like her treating him like a trained poodle.
00:27:26.353,00:27:29.523,"I swear, that boy doesn't piss without her permission."
00:27:33.152,00:27:44.746,"Ever since her husband died, she's been so… The way she frets and fusses over that boy."
00:27:45.247,00:27:48.834,"If only she'd let him run, let him breathe, let him live."
00:27:50.127,00:27:53.505,But she worries that he will overexert himself.
00:27:55.215,00:27:56.466,Not much danger of that.
00:27:56.550,00:27:58.969,She won't even let the poor kid ride a bicycle.
00:28:01.638,00:28:04.308,Do you think he… he'd like to see you?
00:28:07.144,00:28:09.730,"Do you have more of those bean thingies, please?"
00:28:09.813,00:28:10.814,"Oh, sure."
00:28:12.691,00:28:15.861,-Um. How many do you want? -How many have you got?
00:28:23.368,00:28:26.747,"Yeah, shoots the trump from right out under your nose."
00:28:39.092,00:28:42.846,-Are you Serge Muscat? -The one and only. What's your pleasure?
00:28:43.388,00:28:45.599,-Is your wife here? -Josephine?
00:28:46.808,00:28:49.478,"Well, it depends what you want with Josephine."
00:28:50.562,00:28:52.981,"Oh, she left this at my shop."
00:28:54.149,00:28:56.652,"Well, let me have it. I'll give it to her."
00:28:57.819,00:29:00.489,"Oh, no, no, I'll… I'll give it to her myself, thanks."
00:29:08.205,00:29:09.289,Do you wanna play?
00:29:10.624,00:29:13.377,-You know belote? -Of course I do.
00:29:14.670,00:29:15.754,Sit down.
00:29:29.601,00:29:30.686,To be your friend.
00:29:31.687,00:29:34.523,I don't have friends. W… Does Serge know you're here?
00:29:35.649,00:29:36.650,Does it matter?
00:29:38.151,00:29:41.321,Do me a favor. Try one of these rose creams.
00:29:41.780,00:29:44.283,Tell me if you think it's a little heavy on the Cointreau.
00:30:14.980,00:30:17.941,"He says you're indecent, he says you're… you're an influence."
00:30:18.025,00:30:26.575,"You're a bad influence-- No, not Serge. Not him."
00:30:28.368,00:30:29.494,"Reynaud, the mayor."
00:30:31.371,00:30:33.290,He… he talks about you.
00:30:40.422,00:30:41.423,Time to go.
00:30:45.385,00:30:46.845,That's good. Come on.
00:31:17.376,00:31:19.628,"Luc, mind if I take a peek?"
00:31:20.295,00:31:21.296,"Oh, um."
00:31:22.255,00:31:24.341,-It's not really… -Show me.
00:31:25.008,00:31:26.093,Oh.
00:31:27.594,00:31:30.222,"Well, I exaggerated the angle of the head."
00:31:30.472,00:31:31.556,You draw beautifully.
00:31:32.724,00:31:34.810,-What's your going rate? -What?
00:31:35.477,00:31:38.688,To do a portrait? How much would you charge?
00:31:39.398,00:31:46.071,"Oh, I… I couldn't. I'm… I'm not really a… Fifty francs?"
00:31:47.280,00:31:49.241,-Sound reasonable? -It'd be great.
00:31:54.579,00:31:55.455,Oh.
00:31:55.997,00:31:59.918,"I'm… I'm really sorry, but the Comte forbids it."
00:32:04.798,00:32:08.468,He spoke to Mama this morning… and a lot of others.
00:32:12.139,00:32:13.098,Whatever you say.
00:32:14.182,00:32:16.393,I wish I could. I really do.
00:32:27.362,00:32:28.405,Wait.
00:32:50.177,00:32:52.846,Tell me! Am I hurting anyone?
00:32:53.722,00:32:55.307,You're asking me my opinion?
00:32:59.728,00:33:01.688,"Only the truth, mademoiselle."
00:33:02.981,00:33:21.791,"Well, if you're expecting me to just shrivel up and blow away… Let me try and put this into perspective for you."
00:33:22.918,00:33:27.589,The first Comte de Reynaud expelled all the radical Huguenots from this village.
00:33:29.049,00:33:33.470,You and your truffles present a far lesser challenge.
00:33:35.430,00:33:37.516,You'll be out of business by Easter.
00:33:38.892,00:33:39.893,I promise you that.
00:34:13.635,00:34:16.012,I forgot to pay you for something the other day.
00:34:16.096,00:34:18.431,"-I'm sorry. -No, no, it was a gift."
00:34:37.242,00:34:39.452,Would you like to come in for some chocolates?
00:34:54.384,00:34:55.385,How sweet of you.
00:34:56.636,00:34:57.596,Thank you.
00:35:01.933,00:35:02.934,Hmm. It's lovely.
00:35:12.027,00:35:12.944,That's right.
00:35:19.117,00:35:20.201,People talk.
00:35:23.413,00:35:26.666,"I'm sorry. I'm behaving badly, aren't I?"
00:35:27.500,00:35:28.460,"No, it's okay."
00:35:29.210,00:35:30.629,You don't misbehave here.
00:35:37.260,00:35:41.640,or if you don't dig your flower beds or if you don't pretend.
00:35:45.810,00:36:07.540,"…that you want nothing more in your life than to serve your husband three meals a day and give him children and vacuum under his ass, then… Oh, you must think I'm stupid to stay with him."
00:36:10.418,00:36:13.463,"No, I don't think you're… you're stupid."
00:36:13.546,00:36:24.808,"Well, I am. I… Hmm. Things could be different for you, Josephine."
00:36:36.403,00:36:37.320,Oh.
00:36:38.863,00:36:41.032,Then it must be… must be true.
00:36:41.991,00:36:43.076,My mistake.
00:36:58.633,00:37:01.678,Pantoufle wants to hear the story of Grandmère and Grandpère.
00:37:07.642,00:37:09.519,"All right, all right."
00:37:14.149,00:37:34.544,"Your grandfather… George Rocher… -Always told in the same words. -George was honest… George was honest, prosperous, and trusted by his customers."
00:37:36.045,00:37:38.047,But George was not content.
00:37:38.631,00:37:42.427,He felt there should be more to life than dispensing liver oil.
00:37:44.971,00:37:57.025,"In the spring of 1927, the Société Pharmaceutique formed an expedition to Central America to study the medicinal properties of certain natural compounds."
00:37:59.360,00:38:02.739,George was the expedition's most eager volunteer.
00:38:05.909,00:38:08.828,But his adventure took a turn he did not expect.
00:38:12.749,00:38:18.171,"One night, he was invited to drink unrefined cacao with a pinch of chili."
00:38:19.214,00:38:24.511,"The very same drink the ancient Maya, used in their sacred ceremonies."
00:38:27.138,00:38:36.773,The Maya believed cacao held the power to unlock hidden yearnings… and reveal destinies.
00:38:40.318,00:38:44.239,"And so, it was, that George first saw Chitza."
00:38:53.665,00:38:59.921,"but in his romance with Chitza, he was willing to slightly bend the rules of Christian courtship."
00:39:02.423,00:39:05.260,The tribal elders tried to warn George about her.
00:39:05.927,00:39:07.720,She was one of the wanderers.
00:39:08.513,00:39:16.855,"Her people moved with the north wind from village to village, dispensing ancient remedies, never settling down."
00:39:18.106,00:39:19.941,Not a good choice for a bride.
00:39:21.860,00:39:23.987,George did not heed their warning.
00:39:24.654,00:39:29.576,"And for a while, it seemed that he and Chitza might lead a happy life together in France."
00:39:32.620,00:39:36.791,"Alas, the clever north wind had other plans."
00:39:44.966,00:39:53.349,"One morning, George awoke to discover that Chitza and the little girl, Vianne… had gone away."
00:39:57.103,00:40:07.488,"Mother and daughter were fated to wander from village to village, dispensing ancient cacao remedies… traveling with the wind."
00:40:09.449,00:40:13.161,Just as Chitza's people had done for generations.
00:40:13.244,00:40:16.956,Just as Chitza's people had done for generations.
00:40:20.001,00:40:22.629,Will it just go on forever?
00:40:28.426,00:40:29.427,"Night, Mama."
00:40:46.778,00:40:49.405,"Oh. I appreciate your coming in, Armande."
00:40:50.031,00:40:53.451,"All right, what's so important that I had to postpone my nap?"
00:40:54.410,00:40:56.162,Would you like some chocolate cake?
00:41:07.882,00:41:11.844,Grandmother. Grandmother… bonjour.
00:41:14.555,00:41:25.525,"May I, uh… No. No, Thank you, I'm just here to, um, do a portrait."
00:41:25.608,00:41:26.484,Mm-hmm.
00:41:29.070,00:41:30.530,"Yours, actually."
00:41:32.156,00:41:34.575,I… is the light okay where she's sitting?
00:41:39.580,00:41:41.207,"I have something for you, boy."
00:41:42.959,00:41:45.628,I've been carrying it around since your last birthday.
00:41:49.590,00:41:50.925,It's a book of poetry.
00:41:54.846,00:41:55.722,Oh.
00:41:56.973,00:41:57.974,Thank you.
00:41:59.058,00:42:00.643,You don't like poetry?
00:42:00.727,00:42:03.187,"Oh, no, no, no. Of course, I do."
00:42:04.272,00:42:06.524,-Yes. -Neither do I.
00:42:08.401,00:42:10.403,It's not that kind of poetry.
00:42:14.741,00:42:22.290,"And, uh, in a moment of weakness… I prayed to the Virgin Mother to soothe Charly's soul in his hour of suffering."
00:42:23.791,00:42:27.503,You understand an animal has no immortal soul.
00:42:28.546,00:42:30.131,"I understand, mon Père."
00:42:30.757,00:42:32.425,Yet you flout God's law.
00:42:40.683,00:42:42.679,Impure thoughts.
00:42:43.561,00:42:47.129,-The woman who runs the chocolaterie. -Vianne Rocher?
00:42:47.523,00:42:50.651,And she suggested I buy chocolate seashells for the widow Audel.
00:42:55.114,00:42:58.159,I guess that got me to thinking about the widow Audel.
00:42:58.910,00:43:01.204,At her age? At your age?
00:43:02.580,00:43:04.827,Yes. And yes.
00:43:06.959,00:43:10.171,And just what were you doing in a chocolaterie during Lent?
00:43:11.255,00:43:13.216,It was for… for Charly.
00:43:14.133,00:43:16.135,"Again, you flout God's law."
00:43:19.055,00:43:26.854,"Well, but if Charly has no soul… then there's no harm in him breaking Lent."
00:43:28.290,00:43:29.440,"Isn't that so, mon Père?"
00:43:31.984,00:43:34.070,"Ten Hail Marys, twenty Our Fathers."
00:43:36.447,00:43:38.616,Will she never have done then.
00:43:38.699,00:43:42.870,That ghoul queen of a million dead bodies?
00:43:43.621,00:43:45.915,I see myself again.
00:43:45.998,00:43:49.127,Skin rotten with mud and pest.
00:43:49.210,00:43:52.964,Worms in my armpits and in my hair.
00:43:54.465,00:43:57.635,"-It's perfectly wretched, isn't it? -Perfectly."
00:44:07.395,00:44:09.772,Don't worry so much about not supposed to.
00:44:20.032,00:44:21.075,Live a little.
00:44:28.916,00:44:31.210,-I have to go. -What about my picture?
00:44:32.044,00:44:33.838,-Um. Next time. -Hmm.
00:44:40.553,00:44:42.638,Don't look so damn pleased with yourself.
00:44:51.939,00:44:52.982,Stay here.
00:45:07.496,00:45:08.956,-Hey. -…he was so drunk.
00:45:09.957,00:45:12.877,He… he woke up.
00:45:17.298,00:45:34.273,"So, he tried to come after me, but I had already tied his feet with his belt and… Right there on his big, red face!"
00:45:44.951,00:45:46.953,"Oh. It is so stupid, isn't it?"
00:45:52.208,00:45:56.504,"Sometimes, I even forget what really happened."
00:46:09.100,00:46:10.518,I saved her!
00:46:10.601,00:46:13.980,You remember her father collaborated with the Germans?
00:46:14.063,00:46:17.525,"Nobody wanted to touch her, except for me."
00:46:18.192,00:46:21.529,-And this is the way she repays me? -Your anger is understandable.
00:46:21.612,00:46:23.614,Anger? Everybody's gonna be laughing at me!
00:46:23.698,00:46:24.991,That is not your concern.
00:46:26.242,00:46:28.369,Your concern is the sacrament of marriage.
00:46:29.954,00:46:32.540,"-Yeah, of course. The sacrament. -Yes."
00:46:37.044,00:46:38.754,-Like this? -Good.
00:46:38.838,00:46:40.589,"Yes, shake it a little."
00:46:50.182,00:46:52.018,"I'll be right back, okay?"
00:46:59.191,00:47:00.860,"Oh, good morning."
00:47:01.569,00:47:04.196,Can I interest you in some Nipples of Venus?
00:47:05.281,00:47:08.200,Rumor has it that you are harboring Madam Muscat.
00:47:08.284,00:47:09.285,Is that true?
00:47:10.369,00:47:12.038,You make her sound like a fugitive.
00:47:12.121,00:47:16.375,"She is a fugitive from her marriage vows, which have been sanctified by God."
00:47:20.671,00:47:21.881,Come out here a minute.
00:47:25.968,00:47:28.137,"Let His Radiance have a look at you, hmm?"
00:47:34.060,00:47:35.853,Is that sanctified enough for you?
00:47:37.063,00:47:39.190,-It's not the first time. -I'm truly sorry.
00:47:41.751,00:47:43.049,You should have come to me.
00:47:44.904,00:47:47.656,Your husband will be made to repent for this.
00:47:48.449,00:47:50.324,Tell him to repent on someone else's head.
00:47:58.334,00:47:59.210,In there.
00:48:00.378,00:48:01.253,He's ready.
00:48:01.921,00:48:05.174,"Well, but confession must be made in the spirit of contrition."
00:48:06.133,00:48:08.219,Have you come in the spirit of contrition?
00:48:08.302,00:48:09.345,"Contrition, yes."
00:48:09.929,00:48:10.805,He's ready.
00:48:14.433,00:48:19.980,"Licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, gluttony and drunkenness."
00:48:20.981,00:48:21.941,Correct.
00:48:23.067,00:48:25.903,And what are the three conditions for mortal sin?
00:48:26.654,00:48:27.530,Serge?
00:48:29.198,00:48:45.339,Mortal sin… is sin whose object is… committed by deliberate… -consequence. -Incorrect. Didi?
00:48:45.464,00:48:54.223,"Mortal sin is sin whose object is grave matter, which is committed with full knowledge and deliberate consent."
00:49:09.029,00:49:13.951,"Uh. First, you check to see if it's at body temperature."
00:49:14.034,00:49:19.790,-Mm-hmm. -Then you dip the palette knife to see that the couverture hardens on it evenly.
00:49:19.874,00:49:20.833,Correct.
00:49:22.585,00:49:23.752,Closer.
00:49:35.973,00:49:38.893,And the chocolaterie did not go out of business.
00:50:00.206,00:50:03.501,felt himself being drawn into a strange crusade.
00:50:11.217,00:50:13.594,became more than an act of good will.
00:50:15.095,00:50:16.430,It became a test.
00:50:17.640,00:50:23.479,a holy war between château… and chocolaterie.
00:50:47.920,00:50:49.922,I tell myself it's the last time.
00:50:51.006,00:50:55.177,But then I… I get a whiff of a hot chocolate.
00:50:57.596,00:50:58.722,…or those moon things.
00:51:00.140,00:51:02.977,"So small, so plain, so innocent."
00:51:04.144,00:51:07.648,"I thought, with just one little taste, it can't do any harm."
00:51:08.524,00:51:15.823,"But it turned out that they were filled with rich, sinful… Buttery filling and it melts, God forgive me."
00:51:18.826,00:51:20.869,and tortures you with pleasure.
00:51:23.789,00:51:25.874,and done what is evil in your sight.
00:51:36.093,00:51:40.514,"You desire truth in the inward being, therefore teach me wisdom in my secret heart."
00:51:47.771,00:51:55.279,"Though he hoped to redeem Serge, he knew that this redemption alone would not be enough to regain control over the village."
00:51:55.863,00:51:59.783,He understood that some larger lesson needed to be taught.
00:52:17.468,00:52:23.098,"would arrive one quiet afternoon in the dull, green waters of the River Tannes."
00:52:29.938,00:52:30.939,You're it!
00:52:31.440,00:52:32.816,"Hey, look!"
00:52:51.210,00:52:52.461,between you and Caroline.
00:52:53.003,00:52:54.963,'Cause it's none of your damn business.
00:52:58.967,00:53:00.761,I'm an embarrassment to her.
00:53:03.055,00:53:07.142,"I swear, I read dirty books."
00:53:08.143,00:53:10.354,I eat and drink what I like.
00:53:12.481,00:53:16.610,"And sin of sins, I refuse to go to Les Mimosas."
00:53:18.487,00:53:21.115,"When I was a kid, we used to call it Le Mortoir."
00:53:21.490,00:53:23.784,-Hmm. -It's a nursing home for old.
00:53:26.286,00:53:27.705,It's in Toulouse.
00:53:28.205,00:53:29.123,Hmm.
00:53:29.623,00:53:35.045,Caroline loves the thought of a nurse with a clipboard recording my bowel movements.
00:53:38.298,00:53:41.593,"-They're here! They've come to Lansquenet! -Slow down, Anouk, who's here?"
00:53:41.677,00:53:42.678,Pirates!
00:53:43.429,00:53:45.347,-Come on! -Why can't we stay?
00:53:59.570,00:54:01.196,Anybody got a sweet tooth?
00:54:21.508,00:54:22.968,I bet he's the captain.
00:54:36.231,00:54:38.358,For all of us. Sincerely.
00:54:38.734,00:54:39.943,What for?
00:54:43.614,00:54:45.073,And why would I do that?
00:54:45.574,00:54:52.122,"Well, because we river rats are the dregs of society with horrible diseases and criminal impulses."
00:54:55.876,00:54:56.794,Is it true?
00:54:57.336,00:55:00.380,"It's what you townspeople always seem to think, isn't it?"
00:55:05.969,00:55:07.429,Are you here to save us?
00:55:08.347,00:55:12.434,Are you the Catholic Aid Society? French Family League? Communist workers?
00:55:12.518,00:55:13.727,Which idea are you selling?
00:55:14.102,00:55:14.978,Chocolate.
00:55:15.979,00:55:17.022,"I'm sorry, chocolate?"
00:55:17.731,00:55:20.651,What's a river rat? Is it like a pirate?
00:55:23.028,00:55:24.404,"Yeah, you could."
00:55:25.656,00:55:27.366,Have a look at my treasure chest.
00:55:28.158,00:55:29.034,Hmm.
00:55:30.369,00:55:33.831,"-Let me guess, they're for sale. -As a matter of fact, they are."
00:55:36.583,00:55:39.002,You laugh? I can get 50 for them in Paris.
00:55:40.170,00:55:41.380,Then go to Paris.
00:55:49.847,00:55:51.431,"We'll take two, please."
00:55:51.515,00:55:54.309,"-You'll take two? -Yes, please, absolutely."
00:55:56.270,00:55:58.897,I don't know if I have the right change. Just a minute.
00:56:00.691,00:56:01.692,They're beautiful.
00:56:07.906,00:56:09.283,I should probably warn you.
00:56:10.117,00:56:13.620,You make friends with us… you'll make enemies of others.
00:56:14.288,00:56:15.330,That a promise?
00:56:19.167,00:56:20.168,It's a guarantee.
00:56:59.875,00:57:02.920,"Josephine, you look different."
00:57:03.921,00:57:05.130,So do you.
00:57:08.133,00:57:13.055,I just want to tell you that I am so sorry… for everything.
00:57:14.264,00:57:15.641,But I've changed.
00:57:16.642,00:57:19.436,"You see, God has made me a new man."
00:57:21.897,00:57:26.985,"I ask you, uh, I beg you, please accept my apology."
00:57:39.414,00:57:40.332,I accept.
00:57:44.127,00:57:47.923,"I promise, from now on, everything will be different."
00:57:50.300,00:57:52.594,"Everything already is different, Serge."
00:58:01.144,00:58:04.398,Thanks for the apology. The flowers are lovely.
00:58:05.565,00:58:09.861,"No, please don't, Josephine. We are still married in the eyes of God."
00:58:11.154,00:58:12.739,Then he must be blind.
00:58:19.621,00:58:32.759,The council has no legal authority The mayor wishes to say a few words.
00:58:34.261,00:58:36.763,"If I may, ladies and gentlemen of the council."
00:58:38.682,00:58:43.103,"These people are rootless, Godless drifters."
00:58:48.358,00:58:51.528,They would contaminate the spirit of our quiet town.
00:58:56.158,00:58:58.535,"Now, the chairman of the council is quite right."
00:58:58.618,00:59:00.746,We cannot force them to leave.
00:59:03.415,00:59:08.336,But we can help them to understand… they are not welcome.
00:59:26.772,00:59:29.274,"Worthless cow, you're nothing without me!"
00:59:30.150,00:59:32.235,You can't even use a skillet!
00:59:36.490,00:59:38.533,-...goddamn meal on the table. -He's inside.
00:59:45.040,01:00:08.688,Please open the door. I know you… Mama!
01:00:46.852,01:00:48.979,Who says I can't use a skillet?
01:01:15.005,01:01:17.382,Wonderful. Come on.
01:01:25.348,01:01:28.351,His skull can't be as thick as we thought.
01:01:38.445,01:01:40.614,Oh. The worst is over.
01:01:49.206,01:01:50.207,-Hi. -Hey.
01:01:53.793,01:01:56.880,-How long have we got? -She's at the hairdresser for an hour.
01:01:59.216,01:02:01.051,Fuffi? Fuffi.
01:02:01.551,01:02:03.428,"I'm so sorry, but I have to break the appointment."
01:02:03.511,01:02:06.181,"-Is something wrong? -No, I volunteered to distribute these."
01:02:06.264,01:02:08.433,I promised the Comte I'd have them out by the end of the day.
01:02:11.228,01:02:14.022,Not that I expect any of them to stop by for a hairstyle.
01:02:15.273,01:02:18.902,The Comte feels we must stand firm. We cannot trust these people.
01:02:18.985,01:02:21.613,"Before you know it, they'll be doing jobs for food."
01:02:38.755,01:02:40.006,Keep your head still.
01:02:54.271,01:02:55.272,"Hello, Caroline."
01:03:01.569,01:03:03.363,"If you want to blame someone, blame me."
01:03:03.446,01:03:07.033,"-Corrupting him with cocoa. -Oh, how dare you, Mother?"
01:03:10.620,01:03:12.872,"-Mama, I-- -Well, what about you, Mother?"
01:03:14.666,01:03:15.625,Are you fine?
01:03:18.169,01:03:20.505,I bet she has conveniently forgotten to tell you.
01:03:20.588,01:03:24.160,Carol… Are you afraid to?
01:03:24.259,01:03:25.468,-Uh. -Why don't you show?
01:03:32.976,01:03:34.060,Insulin shots.
01:03:34.894,01:03:38.606,"She has diabetes, very advanced. She could be blind within a year."
01:03:39.149,01:03:42.777,"Yeah, couldn't you call me a drug addict? It sounds a lot more glamorous."
01:03:43.403,01:03:46.990,"And you, you-- you sit here, feeding her sweets!"
01:03:47.866,01:03:49.576,There are worse ways to die.
01:03:55.081,01:03:58.335,She needs to be in a place where she can be taken care of.
01:03:58.793,01:03:59.961,Le Mortoir?
01:04:00.962,01:04:02.255,I'd rather be in hell.
01:04:07.927,01:04:08.928,"Luc, come with me."
01:04:09.554,01:04:13.475,-But I don't want to. -He-- He's… He's happy here. It's good for him.
01:04:14.642,01:04:17.729,"I will decide what is good for my son, Madame Muscat."
01:04:27.864,01:04:28.823,Give me another.
01:04:30.241,01:04:33.328,It's my life. Let me enjoy what's left of it. Fill her up.
01:04:33.995,01:04:35.663,"Armande, why didn't you tell me?"
01:04:36.414,01:04:39.376,"Is this a chocolaterie, or is it a confessional?"
01:04:44.089,01:04:45.298,Don't you dare pity me.
01:05:16.121,01:05:17.580,She just wants a soda water.
01:05:20.291,01:05:21.459,I don't serve animals.
01:05:30.176,01:05:31.302,Right.

01:05:52.532,01:05:53.825,Anybody interested?
01:05:57.495,01:05:59.330,I've got just the thing for that. Come in.
01:05:59.414,01:06:01.332,What about boycotting immorality then?
01:06:15.513,01:06:17.599,Hmm. Maybe your daddy would like a taste.
01:06:22.061,01:06:24.314,Here. It's a lot better than those leaves.
01:06:29.903,01:06:31.321,Pantoufle wants to meet you.
01:06:56.346,01:06:58.097,"-That's fantastic. -Oh, thanks."
01:07:10.777,01:07:11.736,Thanks very much.
01:07:18.368,01:07:20.328,"You know, I could fix that if you like."
01:07:20.411,01:07:24.040,"Not with glass, but I can make you a nice strong one out of wood."
01:07:26.042,01:07:28.211,…but I insist on paying you for your work.
01:07:29.170,01:07:30.880,"Well, that makes two of us then."
01:07:35.843,01:07:36.719,Thanks again.
01:07:45.520,01:07:48.523,"Now, she's got one of those river people working for her."
01:07:49.399,01:07:52.485,"Is that a problem? After all, -Christ teaches us-- -Look at this."
01:07:53.611,01:07:59.867,She's soliciting for stalls and street performers for a fertility celebration on Easter Sunday.
01:07:59.951,01:08:01.077,She's cackling at us.
01:08:01.703,01:08:03.580,When are you going to do something about it?
01:08:04.539,01:08:05.498,"Oh, there."
01:08:10.587,01:08:12.755,A small town outside of Sydney.
01:08:15.008,01:08:16.384,What does he eat?
01:08:16.467,01:08:20.972,"Leaves, bugs, and worms, of course."
01:08:22.098,01:08:23.266,What about chocolate?
01:08:23.975,01:08:25.602,Kangaroos don't eat chocolate.
01:08:26.561,01:08:27.770,Has he ever tried it?
01:08:33.234,01:08:34.485,He's not interested.
01:08:37.405,01:08:39.198,"Mr. Pantoufle, you surprise me."
01:08:39.282,01:08:42.368,A world traveler such as yourself not interested in new flavors?
01:08:42.452,01:08:43.578,You should be ashamed.
01:08:44.078,01:08:47.457,"I have a very nice truffle here, if he wants to try it."
01:08:48.625,01:08:51.336,"-You are wasting your time. -Oh, I'm sorry."
01:08:54.339,01:08:57.383,How do you know you don't like chocolate if you refuse to try it?
01:08:57.467,01:08:58.843,Do you like worms?
01:08:59.969,01:09:00.928,What?
01:09:01.012,01:09:03.264,How do you know if you've never tasted one?
01:09:33.795,01:09:34.921,Disgusting.
01:09:44.055,01:09:46.265,-Be free. -You tricked me!
01:09:49.352,01:09:50.770,wears many guises.
01:09:52.897,01:09:57.235,"At times, Satan is the singer of a lurid song you hear on the radio."
01:09:58.986,01:10:01.739,"At times, the author of a salacious novel."
01:10:03.199,01:10:09.747,"At times, the quiet man lurking in the schoolyard, asking your children if he might join their game."
01:10:11.666,01:10:17.130,"And at times, the maker of sweet things… mere trifles."
01:10:18.381,01:10:36.482,"For what could seem more harmless, more innocent… Hey, Guillaume!"
01:10:37.108,01:10:39.652,I've got something new Charly's going to love!
01:10:44.615,01:10:45.658,"Come on, Charly. Come on."
01:11:04.886,01:11:05.803,Anouk.
01:11:06.721,01:11:09.724,-Just tell me what happened? -Are you Satan's helper?
01:11:20.026,01:11:24.489,"Well, you can if you want… but it won't make things easier."
01:11:24.572,01:11:27.575,Why can't you wear black shoes like the other mothers?
01:11:32.622,01:11:35.625,"He's a fine piece of work, our little nobleman."
01:11:36.584,01:11:39.003,No wonder his wife goes gallivanting off.
01:11:39.086,01:11:41.547,"She's been in Italy for months, did you know that?"
01:11:42.215,01:11:45.718,"Armande, the whole town's against me."
01:11:52.183,01:11:55.603,-What? -Wednesday's my 70th.
01:11:56.687,01:12:00.233,Let's show the bastards we're ready to go down dancing.
01:12:09.367,01:12:11.327,You're not well. You have to face it.
01:12:12.078,01:12:13.496,"Okay, okay, okay."
01:12:14.747,01:12:21.003,"But you do this for me and I promise, I check into Le Mortoir the very next morning without a care in the world."
01:12:32.056,01:12:34.183,They don't need to know who's throwing it.
01:12:35.810,01:12:38.145,"-Armande, listen, I-- -No, no, no, you listen."
01:12:41.858,01:12:42.859,I need this.
01:12:49.699,01:12:51.659,"When I need help, I ask for it."
01:13:30.531,01:13:31.532,And did it help?
01:13:35.036,01:13:37.371,"I still didn't sleep, but, yes, yes, it helped."
01:13:44.086,01:13:46.339,-It squeaks. -Does it?
01:13:50.384,01:13:53.971,"-Oh, she's better. She's fine. -Good. How are you?"
01:13:55.723,01:14:01.562,I'm throwing a party… Thanks.
01:14:03.439,01:14:04.398,Who's invited?
01:14:09.111,01:14:13.115,Tell me something. Why do you give a damn about what these narrow-minded villagers think?
01:14:18.037,01:14:19.664,Coming to the party or not?
01:14:22.291,01:14:23.209,I can't.
01:14:24.251,01:14:28.130,There's a boycott against immorality and I must respect that.
01:14:29.006,01:14:30.424,That is a problem.
01:14:30.508,01:14:34.011,"Well, then I'll leave you with this test of your convictions."
01:14:34.804,01:14:36.722,-What is that? -Your favorite.
01:14:39.308,01:14:40.267,Is that right?
01:14:41.477,01:14:42.937,-Thank you. -You're welcome.
01:14:53.864,01:14:54.865,But not my favorite.
01:14:57.618,01:14:58.661,Hmm.
01:15:03.040,01:15:05.251,"I'll come round sometime, get that squeak out of your door."
01:16:59.990,01:17:04.203,"If the Comte finds out… The Comte isn't here, he wasn't invited."
01:17:11.001,01:17:12.878,I'm sure they have other plans.
01:17:17.216,01:17:18.300,Why are you sleeping?
01:17:19.093,01:17:20.094,Hmm?
01:17:27.685,01:17:28.936,Are you not feeling well?
01:17:47.580,01:17:49.039,"Happy birthday, Grandmama."
01:17:52.835,01:17:54.503,The invitation said five o'clock.
01:17:55.337,01:17:57.089,I should have read it more closely.
01:17:58.757,01:18:01.677,"If you had, you'd know there was supposed to be no gifts."
01:18:03.804,01:18:06.307,Don't worry so much about the supposed to.
01:18:09.560,01:18:10.477,You like it?
01:18:20.362,01:18:21.530,You made me younger.
01:18:23.073,01:18:24.200,Very diplomatic.
01:18:38.923,01:18:40.257,Mm.
01:19:21.298,01:19:26.553,"Number one, i-- if you like what you tasted here, you're-- you're going to love my chocolate festival on Sunday."
01:19:34.478,01:19:39.316,It is my duty to announce that there is no dessert here tonight.
01:19:42.069,01:19:44.196,Because it's on Roux's boat.
01:19:47.866,01:19:49.410,"Any complaints, see me."
01:21:32.346,01:21:34.515,"You see, Monsieur le Comte? You see?"
01:21:35.432,01:21:37.643,"There's Josephine, that stupid cow."
01:21:41.522,01:21:43.023,"Something must be done, Serge."
01:22:17.099,01:22:19.226,-You done yet? -Almost.
01:22:20.310,01:22:22.062,-Almost? -Hmm?
01:22:24.481,01:22:26.692,"Come on, leave it. You're done. Come with me."
01:22:29.111,01:22:29.987,Come on.
01:22:33.991,01:22:46.128,I have chocolates… Do you think ev-- everyone had a good time?
01:22:46.253,01:22:47.129,Shh.
01:23:57.199,01:23:58.617,"Vianne, Roux!"
01:24:01.495,01:24:02.496,Thanks.
01:24:03.539,01:24:08.085,This was… Thank you.
01:24:13.840,01:24:17.177,"-I'll take you home. -Oh, for God's sake, don't fuss."
01:24:17.844,01:24:20.347,You'll ruin a perfectly decadent evening.
01:25:23.702,01:25:26.204,Taking your home with you wherever you go?
01:25:27.372,01:25:28.373,"Yeah, why not?"
01:25:30.250,01:25:31.460,Your way must be harder.
01:25:32.502,01:25:34.921,Each time having to make a new home from scratch.
01:25:37.341,01:25:39.635,"Well, maybe this time, I'll get it right."
01:25:45.932,01:25:46.808,What?
01:25:53.815,01:25:57.611,Don't you ever think about belonging somewhere?
01:26:00.447,01:26:01.531,Price is too high.
01:26:02.949,01:26:05.494,You end up caring what people expect of you. No.
01:26:06.828,01:26:08.080,Is that so terrible?
01:26:09.623,01:26:12.042,Having people expect something of you?
01:26:16.755,01:26:18.215,How does Anouk feel about it?
01:26:20.300,01:26:21.343,What?
01:26:22.344,01:26:23.470,All the moving around.
01:26:25.847,01:26:26.932,"No, she's fine."
01:26:27.974,01:26:32.062,She handles it beautifully. She… makes friends easily.
01:26:34.147,01:26:47.869,She has such an unusual… She hates it.
01:28:25.675,01:28:26.718,Vianne.
01:28:28.053,01:28:29.137,"Vianne, come on."
01:28:54.663,01:28:57.207,-We need-- We need more! Hurry up! -Anouk!
01:29:26.987,01:29:28.071,No!
01:29:30.740,01:29:31.825,Jesus!
01:29:47.883,01:29:48.884,Anouk!
01:29:52.846,01:29:53.805,-Stop! -No!
01:29:53.930,01:29:54.973,-No! -No!
01:30:16.202,01:30:17.203,No!
01:30:18.246,01:30:19.247,Come on!
01:31:03.667,01:31:06.336,"-Oh, my God, there she is! -Mama!"
01:31:10.757,01:31:12.008,"Oh, my God."
01:32:32.047,01:32:33.089,"Yes, we're okay."
01:32:35.675,01:32:36.593,You?
01:32:40.889,01:32:45.769,"And I… -came to say, uh… -To say goodbye. Yes, I know."
01:32:53.735,01:32:54.611,What?
01:32:56.029,01:32:56.946,Your boat.
01:32:59.616,01:33:00.784,You've lost your home.
01:33:02.994,01:33:03.870,No.
01:33:05.246,01:33:07.624,"Just a way to get from place to place, really."
01:33:11.544,01:33:13.630,"-So, how will you, uh… -I'll manage."
01:33:33.358,01:33:45.245,"Well… Vianne… -listen, I… -I know. I'm sorry."
01:33:47.997,01:33:49.040,I'm sorry.
01:34:09.102,01:34:11.020,He would have wanted you to have it.
01:34:11.980,01:34:14.774,"Just you promise me that you'll never run away again, okay?"
01:34:14.858,01:34:21.865,"Mama, she… What's wrong, Luc?"
01:34:31.791,01:34:35.170,we can hope they were thoughts of penitence.
01:34:37.046,01:34:44.262,We can hope she asked God to forgive the self-indulgence that aggravated her illness and caused her death.
01:34:45.722,01:34:48.558,And we can pause to reexamine our own lives.
01:34:49.976,01:34:53.771,We can resist those who would lead us into temptation.
01:35:06.326,01:35:36.564,"Blessed is the one who endures temptation, for when he has stood the test… Can we go home now?"
01:35:59.545,01:36:02.423,Of course. Of course.
01:36:07.136,01:36:08.638,"Whatever you like, Mama."
01:36:10.807,01:36:13.893,"Vianne, did you want me to start the ganache for the festival?"
01:36:14.894,01:36:15.770,Vianne?
01:36:17.522,01:36:21.651,Did you… What are you doing?
01:36:22.819,01:36:23.695,Leaving.
01:36:25.113,01:36:26.489,First thing in the morning.
01:36:39.502,01:36:42.880,Is it because of Armande? That was not your fault.
01:36:47.635,01:36:48.845,This is who I am.
01:36:58.229,01:37:00.023,Did you believe anything you told me?
01:37:02.191,01:37:03.901,Did you believe I could be better?
01:37:05.862,01:37:07.113,Was it all a joke?
01:37:17.457,01:37:18.666,I have to pack now.
01:37:23.338,01:37:26.466,"If you leave, everything will go back to the way it always was."
01:37:27.425,01:37:29.177,It is the way it always was.
01:37:32.347,01:37:33.389,Not for me.
01:37:41.856,01:37:42.774,Beg your pardon?
01:37:45.193,01:37:50.323,I suppose it… can't be easy having her gone.
01:37:54.077,01:37:56.996,"Can't seem to get used to it, no matter how much time."
01:38:04.253,01:38:05.630,look forward to her return.
01:38:09.050,01:38:18.267,I don't believe… anyone would think less of you… if you were to say she was never coming back.
01:38:22.438,01:38:23.439,"Good night, Paul."
01:38:44.252,01:38:45.711,I need to talk to you.
01:38:54.262,01:38:55.221,Come in.
01:38:56.472,01:38:57.473,Monsieur le Comte.
01:38:59.475,01:39:00.351,It's all right.
01:39:02.687,01:39:06.858,Sorry to bother you… -Monsieur le Comte. -All right.
01:39:10.945,01:39:12.653,"It was the right thing to do, wasn't it?"
01:39:14.365,01:39:15.928,Of course it was. I-- I know it was.
01:39:17.535,01:39:24.876,"It's everything with Josephine. Uh… -…what are you talking about? -The fire, Monsieur le Comte."
01:39:24.959,01:39:37.763,"I know it was the right thing to do, but, uh… I can't get rid of the faces and the screams. I… the fire was an act of God."
01:39:39.765,01:39:41.559,"It was me, Monsieur le Comte."
01:39:46.731,01:39:47.899,You told me.
01:39:48.858,01:39:49.817,Remember?
01:39:51.360,01:39:54.363,"You said, Something has to be done, Serge."
01:39:56.073,01:39:58.743,"Well… you did, didn't you?"
01:40:07.668,01:40:08.836,People could have died.
01:40:10.254,01:40:12.006,You want their blood on your hands?
01:40:13.799,01:40:15.218,On-- On my hands?
01:40:16.802,01:40:19.722,"Should I go to Père Henri, and ask for forgiveness?"
01:40:22.058,01:40:23.267,"Listen to me, Serge."
01:40:25.186,01:40:26.312,Listen very carefully.
01:40:28.523,01:40:33.986,You must leave this village at once… and never return.
01:40:35.363,01:40:40.076,"-Why would I leave my home and my café? -Because I'm evicting you, that's why!"
01:40:41.702,01:40:45.623,"What you have done puts you beyond anyone's help, beyond my help, anybody's help!"
01:40:46.415,01:40:47.291,"Now, get out!"
01:40:48.376,01:40:49.877,Unless you will tell the police what you've done!
01:40:49.961,01:40:52.338,Get out! Get out! Get out!
01:40:55.883,01:40:56.759,Oh.
01:40:58.302,01:40:59.262,Oh.
01:41:15.736,01:41:20.116,"-Oh, no, I'm not going. -Well, it's hard for me too."
01:41:22.577,01:41:24.829,-Please put it on. -I hate you.
01:41:26.956,01:41:29.417,You're entitled. I said put it on.
01:41:37.216,01:41:38.301,Get up.
01:41:38.384,01:41:41.470,-I have a bad leg like Pantoufle. -Stop that. Get up.
01:41:45.099,01:41:47.018,-Walk. Walk! -You're hurting me.
01:41:47.101,01:42:27.350,"Well, stop being… I'm sorry, Mama."
01:42:28.559,01:42:29.602,I'm sorry.
01:42:33.856,01:42:35.066,"Don't worry, Mama."
01:42:46.535,01:42:49.705,"The next town will be better, won't it, Mama?"
01:42:52.958,01:42:55.795,It will. It will be wonderful.
01:42:58.923,01:43:00.758,"I'm ready to go now, okay?"
01:43:36.669,01:43:37.712,"Like this, Mama."
01:43:43.634,01:43:46.595,"No, no, you've got to cut on the corners like this."
01:43:46.679,01:43:47.972,"So, just cut them."
01:43:55.730,01:43:56.772,Good.
01:44:07.658,01:44:09.160,How do you like these almonds?
01:44:13.497,01:44:14.957,Are they chopped fine enough?
01:44:22.465,01:44:23.591,"Are they okay, Vianne?"
01:44:41.025,01:44:44.612,"My friends, let this Easter day be for us too, a rebirth."
01:44:44.695,01:44:47.239,"-Let us strive-- -No, no, no, no, no, no."
01:44:48.115,01:44:50.075,"No, don't-- don't bury the word rebirth."
01:44:50.159,01:44:51.869,Uh. Let it ring out.
01:44:51.952,01:44:54.622,"Let this day be for us too, a rebirth!"
01:44:54.705,01:45:02.338,"You see, we are extolling our-- our parishioners to-- to resurrect their moral awareness, hmm? Okay, good, good. T-- Try again."
01:45:02.421,01:45:04.632,I think we've gone over this enough. Let-- Let's call it a day.
01:45:04.715,01:45:06.509,-What? -I'm very tired.
01:45:06.592,01:45:09.136,"Oh, fine, fine. Well, leave it with me. I may have one or two suggestions."
01:45:11.347,01:45:12.640,A revision here and there.
01:45:12.723,01:45:17.394,"I mean, we want it to be perfect tomorrow, don't we? Hmm?"
01:45:24.193,01:45:25.194,We must resist.
01:45:26.153,01:45:29.824,"We must resist the shallow, worldly temptations of our mortal-- No, no."
01:45:29.907,01:45:34.620,"We must renounce shallow, worldly temptations of our mortal flesh."
01:45:48.926,01:45:50.803,All my efforts have been for nothing.
01:45:52.555,01:45:54.056,I've suffered willingly.
01:45:55.182,01:45:58.769,I've fasted. I've hardly eaten for weeks now.
01:46:02.273,01:46:04.066,"I'm-- I'm sorry, my-- my suffering is nothing."
01:46:04.149,01:46:06.819,It's just that I-- I feel so lost.
01:46:12.533,01:46:14.368,Tell me what to do.
01:48:02.851,01:48:03.727,Oh!
01:49:51.460,01:49:52.336,Drink this.
01:49:53.337,01:49:54.254,It'll refresh you.
01:49:54.838,01:49:55.798,I promise.
01:49:57.049,01:49:57.966,"Go ahead, drink."
01:50:10.938,01:50:11.939,I'm so sorry.
01:50:14.066,01:50:15.275,I won't tell a soul.
01:50:19.571,01:50:21.323,Hmm. Better get cleaned up.
01:50:22.908,01:50:24.076,Easter Sunday.
01:50:26.328,01:50:27.287,The sermon.
01:50:32.501,01:50:33.585,I didn't finish it.
01:50:35.712,01:50:36.922,I'll think of something.
01:50:50.102,01:50:54.606,I'm not sure… what the theme of my homily today ought to be.
01:50:58.110,01:51:02.489,Do I want to speak of the miracle of our Lord's divine transformation?
01:51:04.449,01:51:05.325,"Not really, no."
01:51:07.202,01:51:10.622,I don't want to talk about His divinity.
01:51:13.167,01:51:15.043,I'd rather talk about his humanity.
01:51:17.004,01:51:20.215,"I mean, you know, how he lived his life here on Earth."
01:51:21.508,01:51:25.179,"His kindness, His tolerance."
01:51:26.471,01:51:28.098,"Listen, here's what I think."
01:51:29.349,01:51:34.354,I think we can't go around measuring our goodness by what we don't do.
01:51:35.939,01:51:41.320,"By what we deny ourselves, what we resist and who we exclude."
01:51:44.239,01:51:54.374,I think we've got to measure goodness… by what we embrace… what we create… and who we include.
01:52:03.926,01:52:09.306,Père Henri would ever preach… nor the most eloquent.
01:52:12.142,01:52:15.312,But the parishioners felt a new sensation that day.
01:52:49.763,01:52:50.764,Some for you?
01:52:57.771,01:53:01.066,"-Monsieur le Comte, try one of these. -Oh, thank you."
01:53:06.738,01:53:07.698,released.
01:53:13.453,01:53:18.333,"Although, it would take another six months before he'd work up the nerve to ask Caroline out to dinner."
01:53:41.690,01:53:47.487,she took over the lease at the old café… and gave it a new name.
01:54:27.152,01:54:30.280,"Friends in need, yet to be discovered."
01:54:32.991,01:54:35.410,"Battles, yet to be fought."
01:54:58.725,01:55:03.897,"And so, it was, the north wind grew weary… and went on its way."
01:55:05.774,01:55:11.863,"When summer came to the little village, a new breeze from the south blew soft and warm."
01:55:17.661,01:55:20.372,Just needed an adjustment. I hope it'll be better now.
01:55:24.459,01:55:28.713,"My mother knew Roux's return had nothing to do with a silly, old door."
01:55:32.175,01:55:33.135,So did I.
01:55:36.221,01:55:37.556,I thought you'd never guess.
01:55:39.015,01:55:40.392,"My favorite, hot chocolate."
01:55:43.645,01:55:44.646,I knew that.
01:55:58.285,01:56:05.792,"Well, his bad leg miraculously healed… and he hopped off in search of new adventures."
