00:06:58.625,00:02:08.208,"The drizzling rain with soft wind Leaning onto the street at dusk With the wind still slapping my face With rain no longer blurring my eyes I looked up to the lonely street light Where a sad love story came to my mind I like you I like your breathtaking eyes I like your delightful laughter Just like yesterday You and me TAIXIANG PAWNSHOP SANG YU, ONE MILLION YUAN ASSORTED PANCAKES ASSORTED PANCAKES ASSORTED PANCAKES I looked up to the lonely street light Where a sad love story came to my mind I like you I like your breathtaking eyes I like your delightful laughter I wish To gently caress Your lovely face again To hold hands and talk in our dreams Just like yesterday You and me Every night, I walk with my shadow Wandering around Feeling so cold I used to live in my own world Without ever knowing His pain I like you I like your breathtaking eyes I like your delightful laughter I wish To gently caress Your lovely face again To hold hands and talk in our dreams Just like yesterday You and me Making you love me Is simple But meeting you Is so hard You ride a boat with sails raised To the opposite shore It's so simple for men And women to fall in love When trapped in their obsession with you The boat overturns And your wounds start to rot BANK BALANCE I handle pressure better than most."
00:02:08.291,00:02:13.833,"Yeah, my parents are dead, and I don't have any friends, but God gives everyone a challenge, right?"
00:02:15.416,00:02:18.333,"I'm smart, talented, hard working."
00:02:18.916,00:02:21.291,Success should be just around the corner.
00:02:21.791,00:02:23.500,But I have this problem.
00:02:23.583,00:02:27.500,I… I haven't been able to sleep in months.
00:04:19.416,00:04:22.875,"Hey, I know you're in there! Open the door or I'll break it down."
00:04:22.958,00:04:24.750,"You're gonna hide from me, huh?"
00:04:24.833,00:04:26.916,I've now grown impatient with you.
00:04:27.416,00:04:29.916,"You artists are such freaks or just… Well, I've had it!"
00:04:31.000,00:04:32.791,Come out now! I have leftovers.
00:04:32.875,00:04:35.500,"Eat them, get out! Don't you dare starve to death in my house!"
00:04:38.375,00:04:39.250,"Come on, open up!"
00:04:40.041,00:04:41.041,Open up!
00:04:44.375,00:04:49.625,Some believe that dreams are a kind of reality that the soul encounters when it leaves the body.
00:04:49.708,00:04:53.958,"From that perspective, our world is the true dream. One out of many."
00:04:57.250,00:05:05.750,"When they catch you, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung reached similar conclusions as China's own Duke of Zhou."
00:05:07.166,00:05:10.208,that humans have been locked in by a more advanced species.
00:05:10.291,00:05:12.000,They feared our intelligence.
00:05:12.083,00:05:15.750,We all have great wisdom and power hidden deep within us.
00:05:15.833,00:05:20.416,"Once we unlock it, humans can re-experience the past, change the future."
00:05:20.500,00:05:21.625,Become omnipotent.
00:05:21.708,00:05:26.833,That's why our jailers only allow us to develop 10 to 15% of our brain capacity.
00:05:26.916,00:05:28.958,The rest is off-limits.
00:05:29.041,00:05:34.125,"In every brain, they have placed a horrible monster to make sure we never access our true power."
00:05:34.208,00:05:36.000,punishing intruders with no mercy.
00:05:36.083,00:05:40.125,How can we reach our power with the enemy lying in our nightmares?
00:05:47.333,00:05:49.875,These practices have been passed down by our ancestors.
00:05:49.958,00:05:51.916,"You can believe in it, or not."
00:05:52.000,00:05:55.041,"Like all of us, your fate has already been written."
00:06:00.375,00:06:05.625,Only in dreams can people go into the darkest corners of their minds and see their true selves.
00:06:05.708,00:06:08.083,"Often what they find, scares them."
00:06:10.708,00:06:13.333,It's someone who's seen what is not supposed to.
00:06:22.333,00:06:23.458,Excuse me.
00:06:23.541,00:06:24.541,"One, please."
00:06:35.916,00:06:37.125,And no egg.
00:07:31.166,00:07:32.541,"Hey, I said no eggs."
00:07:34.291,00:07:35.291,It's on me.
00:07:40.958,00:07:42.000,There you are.
00:07:42.083,00:07:43.041,Thank you.
00:07:56.833,00:07:58.791,"Why aren't you answering my calls, huh?"
00:07:58.875,00:08:00.750,-Are you pushing me? -I'm not pushing.
00:08:00.833,00:08:02.666,-We're gonna talk now. -I'll get back to you.
00:08:02.750,00:08:05.125,-Give me two days! -Why are you running? Stop!
00:08:05.833,00:08:06.791,Get back here!
00:08:41.458,00:08:43.333,"You really let me down, man."
00:08:43.916,00:08:45.333,You broke our contract.
00:08:46.416,00:08:48.875,"I can sue you, you want that?"
00:08:58.375,00:09:01.250,This bowl represents the human mind.
00:09:01.333,00:09:05.166,There's a fish moving around that represent your consciousness.
00:09:05.250,00:09:09.083,"The rest of the water, which is empty, represents the subconscious."
00:09:15.375,00:09:19.708,"When conscious mind leaves the subconscious behind, it's like a fish out of water."
00:09:19.791,00:09:21.458,I'm just like this fish.
00:09:26.958,00:09:28.375,Hey! Don't touch that!
00:09:30.750,00:09:33.666,Wait. Are you telling me this is all because of your insomnia?
00:09:34.708,00:09:36.833,"When I try to sleep, my nightmares find me."
00:09:37.916,00:09:40.250,"At first, I even thought I was schizophrenic."
00:09:40.333,00:09:41.458,Or maybe cursed.
00:09:42.416,00:09:45.083,"-It's something else. -If you can't sleep, then write!"
00:09:45.166,00:09:47.208,I can't barely concentrate on it.
00:09:47.291,00:09:49.333,Then give me back the advance.
00:09:51.166,00:09:52.125,I spent it already.
00:09:53.333,00:09:54.500,Spend it on what?
00:09:55.125,00:09:56.750,I think you're just lazy!
00:09:56.833,00:10:00.041,"You don't even try to work, you keep making excuses."
00:10:00.791,00:10:02.500,I'll give you ten more days.
00:10:03.000,00:10:04.625,Do you think your writing is so special?
00:10:05.208,00:10:08.250,I took a big risk when I hired you to write this.
00:10:08.333,00:10:10.833,It should be easy money for you!
00:10:10.916,00:10:13.166,"So, whatever you need to do, do it!"
00:10:13.250,00:10:15.000,Just please make it quick.
00:10:15.083,00:10:16.583,Pull yourself together!
00:11:26.791,00:11:27.750,Come again.
00:13:14.583,00:13:15.541,I'm sorry.
00:13:15.625,00:13:17.208,I can't write the script.
00:13:18.375,00:13:21.291,I guess I'll have to pay you back in the next life.
00:13:24.083,00:13:26.041,I can't keep going like this.
00:13:26.791,00:13:32.250,"If I can't fight the nightmares, then I'll never be able to face the reality there."
00:13:35.166,00:13:40.208,I don't think I can tell the difference anymore between reality and my dreams.
00:13:40.750,00:13:44.916,"This feeling, it's too much to handle."
00:13:46.375,00:13:50.166,Everything I ever wanted is getting further away from me.
00:13:53.708,00:13:55.458,My life doesn't mean anything.
00:13:55.541,00:13:56.875,Not anymore.
00:13:58.416,00:14:00.125,I wanna see my friends again.
00:14:00.916,00:14:02.416,Say goodbye.
00:14:16.333,00:14:19.250,This time with egg and sausage! On the house!
00:14:44.833,00:14:54.708,"Tastes so good… I definitely owe you for this, but I'm afraid I can't pay you back."
00:14:55.375,00:14:57.583,We all hit a rough spot now and then.
00:14:59.041,00:15:00.791,"Nothing we can't beat, huh?"
00:15:00.875,00:15:06.250,"I must have done something horrible in my past life, I think I'm paying for it in this one."
00:15:06.333,00:15:07.583,Paying day and night.
00:15:07.666,00:15:09.541,I'm paying all the time!
00:15:13.791,00:15:15.166,"What was so bad, young man?"
00:15:16.875,00:15:17.708,Breakup?
00:15:19.541,00:15:20.583,You were fired?
00:15:21.791,00:15:22.750,Insulted?
00:15:29.416,00:15:31.625,None of those things owed your life.
00:15:32.375,00:15:36.041,"I used my life every night in my nightmares, it is horrible."
00:15:36.125,00:15:40.166,I can't sleep anymore because of it. How do you expect me to deal with that?
00:15:42.500,00:15:45.916,"How about next time you dream, just wake up before you die?"
00:15:48.375,00:15:49.458,How will I do that?
00:15:50.083,00:15:51.791,"Face it, I'm hopeless."
00:15:54.500,00:15:58.583,"You know, it's strange that people wish to die."
00:15:58.666,00:16:02.291,"They always say, I'm better off dead."
00:16:03.833,00:16:06.333,"Then they keep on living just the same, don't they?"
00:16:09.625,00:16:15.625,"So, you see, wishing for death reminds us that we're still alive."
00:16:15.708,00:16:23.625,"By the same logic, if you wanna wake up, just say, I'm only dreaming."
00:16:25.125,00:16:26.833,And you just might wake up.
00:17:08.458,00:17:10.750,"In this condition, I'm gonna give you 20."
00:18:16.041,00:18:17.000,Is that really you?
00:18:19.958,00:18:21.250,What happened?
00:18:23.541,00:18:24.750,Do you need some help?
00:18:27.750,00:18:30.041,But don't you don't remember me at all?
00:18:33.083,00:18:34.041,Come on.
00:18:34.125,00:18:35.750,Let's go get something to eat.
00:18:39.250,00:18:40.250,It's okay.
00:18:55.625,00:18:58.791,Hello? Ambulance here right away.
00:19:14.541,00:19:16.041,I'm only dreaming.
00:19:16.125,00:19:17.166,I'm only dreaming.
00:20:19.875,00:20:20.833,Ow.
00:20:36.583,00:20:37.958,This is all a dream!
00:20:40.833,00:20:43.333,I said I'm dreaming! I'm dreaming!
00:20:56.083,00:20:57.333,Let's go over there.
00:21:05.416,00:21:06.416,Hey.
00:21:08.250,00:21:10.166,You got something? Let's take a look.
00:21:11.250,00:21:12.625,"Hey, don't be shy. Come on."
00:21:18.625,00:21:19.541,"Oh, she's heavy."
00:21:20.750,00:21:22.000,You made this?
00:21:22.083,00:21:28.833,Um… I'll trade you for this piece here.
00:21:28.916,00:21:30.208,"It's famous, you know?"
00:21:30.791,00:21:32.125,Stabbed someone royal.
00:21:34.500,00:21:37.250,"Hey, he's not making that up. All these swords have a story."
00:21:37.333,00:21:39.416,"Hey, this is just some old piece of junk."
00:21:39.500,00:21:41.000,"I'll buy it, thousand Yuan."
00:21:41.083,00:21:44.041,-How about you go bother someone else? -How about my offer?
00:21:44.125,00:21:45.625,"Listen, here's what we'll do."
00:21:45.708,00:21:48.125,"You give me that sword, I'll give you 2,000 cash."
00:21:58.500,00:22:01.250,"-Hey, where are you going? -Come back! I'll double it!"
00:22:08.083,00:22:09.291,"I can do 5,000."
00:22:10.625,00:22:12.666,"30,000 Yuan, all right?"
00:22:18.125,00:22:21.333,"Or… 20,000 Yuan."
00:22:54.333,00:22:55.291,Hey.
00:22:55.375,00:22:56.791,"I'd like a room, please."
00:23:01.958,00:23:02.791,Ah! Uh!
00:24:51.041,00:24:52.166,Hello?
00:25:11.541,00:25:13.083,I'm only dreaming.
00:25:20.000,00:25:21.083,This a dream!
00:26:30.291,00:26:32.458,It is only a dream!
00:26:34.333,00:26:35.500,It's only a dream!
00:28:00.708,00:28:01.541,This is my room.
00:28:12.875,00:28:13.833,What the fuck?
00:28:16.666,00:28:17.833,For your cab.
00:28:17.916,00:28:18.833,Mm!
00:28:18.916,00:28:20.166,Dinner's on me.
00:28:20.250,00:28:21.125,Good night.
00:29:07.083,00:29:08.416,I'm really dreaming now!
00:29:24.458,00:29:25.583,Hm?
00:31:22.125,00:31:24.083,I'm dreaming!
00:31:42.208,00:31:43.166,"Right, right."
00:31:54.083,00:31:55.166,That's good.
00:31:55.916,00:31:58.208,"Mr. Sang, I wanted to ask. Where did you get these items?"
00:31:58.291,00:31:59.666,And why that does matter?
00:32:03.291,00:32:04.583,Don't get the wrong idea.
00:32:05.083,00:32:08.416,"In this business, everyone has trick to up their sleeve."
00:32:09.166,00:32:15.166,"Tomb raiding, or smuggling… It doesn't matter to me either way."
00:32:15.250,00:32:17.750,"Just as long as nothing comes back on us, right?"
00:32:17.833,00:32:18.791,When it's finished?
00:32:21.708,00:32:23.000,"Please, I mean nothing."
00:32:29.041,00:32:31.958,It's my hope you'll come to us again in the future.
00:32:33.916,00:32:36.458,See you then. We're looking forward to it.
00:32:47.625,00:32:48.458,Sang Yu?
00:32:49.625,00:32:50.625,Sang Yu!
00:32:55.625,00:33:10.000,What the… What?
00:33:11.041,00:33:13.041,I thought you were gonna kill yourself.
00:33:13.958,00:33:15.208,Why aren't you dead?
00:33:15.791,00:33:16.791,-Hold on. -Fuck you!
00:33:17.541,00:33:19.125,Let's grab dinner sometime.
00:33:19.791,00:33:21.291,You think I'm stupid?
00:33:21.375,00:33:24.166,"San, really, let me take you to dinner."
00:33:29.666,00:33:31.833,"If I end up having to pay, I'll kill you."
00:33:32.625,00:33:35.000,Why did you send me those insane texts?
00:33:35.791,00:33:38.875,"It's almost like… You know, I can't figure it out."
00:33:38.958,00:33:41.375,You're like a completely new person.
00:33:41.458,00:33:44.125,What happened to that tortured genius writer I found?
00:33:44.208,00:33:46.833,"I liked you better then, at least you had my respect."
00:33:50.583,00:33:52.375,"Hey, I'm talking to you!"
00:34:05.333,00:34:08.000,Twenty grand. I wanna make it up to you.
00:34:15.833,00:34:20.666,"It's my way of saying… Well, I hope you aren't upset."
00:34:33.125,00:34:36.041,"if you found a way to get rich fast, you gotta teach me."
00:35:19.666,00:35:20.500,Oh!
00:35:20.583,00:35:21.541,Hello.
00:35:23.166,00:35:24.750,What can I get for you?
00:35:29.458,00:35:31.083,-Latte. -Okay.
00:35:35.583,00:35:36.625,Coming right up.
00:36:04.416,00:36:05.916,Can I get you anything else?
00:36:07.708,00:36:09.000,Do you remember me?
00:36:10.166,00:36:11.791,I'll remember you next time.
00:36:19.750,00:36:21.333,Why are you selling your café?
00:36:21.416,00:36:23.875,No customers. No profits.
00:36:23.958,00:36:26.250,-How much do you want for it? -Why do ask?
00:36:26.333,00:36:27.416,You want it?
00:36:27.500,00:36:28.791,Just give me a number.
00:36:30.458,00:36:34.833,"Between rent, renovation, and equipment… I think I need one and a half million."
00:36:44.291,00:36:46.333,"Look, I've analyzed the whole thing."
00:36:46.416,00:36:53.000,"Firstly, you're a screenwriter. You have a way with words, No problem expressing yourself. And secondly, you're loaded!"
00:36:53.083,00:36:54.875,It's a done deal.
00:36:54.958,00:36:58.041,"Money can, I'm sorry for speaking, help a man a lot."
00:36:58.125,00:36:59.750,She can't resist you.
00:37:20.500,00:37:21.625,Okay.
00:37:22.958,00:37:24.083,I'm outta here.
00:37:25.875,00:37:27.708,"If you need something, just call me."
00:37:36.541,00:37:37.416,I'm leaving!
00:38:17.458,00:38:18.791,I'm dreaming!
00:38:28.666,00:38:29.791,So what now?
00:38:29.875,00:38:33.250,"Dude, did you get crazy superpowers somehow, huh?"
00:38:33.333,00:38:35.375,I think God has chosen you.
00:38:36.166,00:38:41.166,This has to be some kind of reward to make up for all of the suffering in your life.
00:38:41.250,00:38:44.333,I… I… I… I think I should be your partner.
00:38:44.416,00:38:45.833,"That's enough, San."
00:38:45.916,00:38:46.750,Be cool.
00:38:46.833,00:38:51.250,"If you need anything at all, I will making it happen."
00:38:51.875,00:38:55.708,"I swear, from this moment, you're my brother."
00:38:56.291,00:38:58.875,"-Get up. -No, I won't. Never."
00:39:08.750,00:39:10.750,This. What does this mean?
00:39:12.083,00:39:14.791,"Well, I was hoping to buy this place."
00:39:14.875,00:39:16.791,But I want you to stay and run it.
00:39:17.375,00:39:18.583,I'll cover the losses.
00:39:19.166,00:39:22.416,And we'll share the profit.
00:39:29.125,00:39:30.000,Hey.
00:39:32.833,00:39:34.541,Are you busy right now?
00:39:38.666,00:39:40.333,I think you're gonna love it.
00:39:45.458,00:39:51.458,Sang Yu… I feel like I've heard that name before somewhere.
00:39:56.541,00:40:00.000,"The name is part of the saying, Lose something, gain something."
00:40:00.083,00:40:01.291,Now you know.
00:40:07.666,00:40:09.541,Why do you wanna buy my shop?
00:40:12.375,00:40:16.833,Um… I'm a pretty serious coffee drinker.
00:40:16.916,00:40:18.541,And the location is good.
00:40:20.541,00:40:23.708,"I wouldn't know how to run it, I'd mess up the good job you're doing."
00:40:23.791,00:40:24.625,That's why.
00:40:25.208,00:40:26.500,I'm not so sure.
00:40:26.583,00:40:27.791,I'm losing money.
00:40:29.125,00:40:32.583,It needs… a little nurturing.
00:40:32.666,00:40:35.041,"I'll say just it some time, it'll be fine."
00:40:37.083,00:40:40.083,Liking coffee is just not the same as business.
00:40:40.833,00:40:44.708,I'll send over a contract tomorrow. We'll bear the profits and losses equally.
00:40:48.958,00:40:50.125,I accept.
00:40:50.208,00:40:51.416,You should read the contract.
00:40:51.500,00:40:53.250,I already trust you.
00:41:03.416,00:41:05.958,I think you're interested in something other than my business.
00:41:11.166,00:41:17.583,"I just wanna say, if you're married or taken in any other way, then don't waste your breath."
00:42:06.208,00:42:08.083,Whoo!
00:42:34.541,00:42:36.375,Whoo!
00:43:18.666,00:43:20.291,"Oh, wow!"
00:43:24.666,00:43:26.500,"-It's still hot, careful. -Thank you."
00:43:28.250,00:43:30.291,"Wow, seems our tables are full."
00:43:30.375,00:43:31.500,"Mm, I'll get it to go."
00:43:40.083,00:43:41.875,I'll… I'll be with you in a second.
00:43:44.000,00:43:46.458,"I'm sorry, we're really busy today. There you are."
00:44:08.708,00:44:11.208,"Come on, people. I'm literally handing out money."
00:44:11.291,00:44:14.166,"-You got a crazy business model, man. -Give me some more."
00:44:14.250,00:44:15.958,"All right, go on. Get in there."
00:44:22.041,00:44:23.250,Thank you.
00:44:42.375,00:44:43.375,Mm.
00:44:46.666,00:44:49.958,"All those people in my shop… I mean, our shop."
00:44:50.541,00:44:52.958,I've never seen anything like it before.
00:44:53.708,00:44:55.833,You must be my lucky charm.
00:44:55.916,00:44:57.208,"No, no."
00:44:58.625,00:45:01.000,I've never had so much coffee before.
00:45:01.083,00:45:02.250,"Five cups, I think."
00:45:02.916,00:45:03.791,It was six cups.
00:45:03.875,00:45:05.458,"Ah, six cups?"
00:45:09.416,00:45:12.125,"Hey, I've never actually seen you go into work."
00:45:13.041,00:45:15.458,"Mm, I usually do my work at night."
00:45:15.541,00:45:16.583,Ah.
00:45:16.666,00:45:17.750,Night shift?
00:45:22.083,00:45:27.291,"All right, you give me three good hints, then I'll guess what you do for a living."
00:45:27.375,00:45:29.458,"-You won't be able to. -Come on, try me."
00:45:29.541,00:45:31.166,I think I'm going to get it.
00:45:35.458,00:45:36.666,Dreaming.
00:45:36.750,00:45:37.750,Seeking.
00:45:38.291,00:45:39.125,Gaining.
00:45:46.833,00:45:47.916,"So, I was right?"
00:45:48.000,00:45:49.916,How could you have guessed that?
00:45:50.000,00:45:53.250,"Well, if you think about it, the story is like a dream."
00:45:53.833,00:45:55.666,"And the second hint, seeking."
00:45:55.750,00:45:59.791,"The characters, always looking for love or looking for themselves."
00:45:59.875,00:46:03.666,"As for the gaining, people always expect to gain something at the end of a story."
00:46:03.750,00:46:07.375,Maybe that would be success or an adventure at the very least.
00:46:56.916,00:46:57.750,I'm dreaming!
00:47:01.833,00:47:03.666,Who's there? What's going on?
00:47:03.750,00:47:05.083,What's happening?
00:47:10.875,00:47:11.958,Thank you.
00:47:18.125,00:47:21.291,I guess you're planning to walk me home every day?
00:47:24.125,00:47:25.208,If you don't mind.
00:47:26.208,00:47:29.083,"Since you're my partner, it's the least I can do for you."
00:47:29.166,00:47:32.250,"To be fair, you also buy six coffees every day."
00:47:41.625,00:47:42.625,Give it a shot.
00:47:42.708,00:47:44.375,I haven't driven in so long.
00:47:44.958,00:47:47.333,Go ahead. You can crash it if you want.
00:47:47.416,00:47:50.083,What? No way! I could never afford to fix this.
00:47:56.375,00:47:57.708,-It's fast. -I see that.
00:47:57.791,00:47:58.750,Give me a sec.
00:48:12.458,00:48:16.375,"Ah, you know, I got this car for you."
00:48:22.000,00:48:24.041,"Okay, you must be super rich."
00:48:28.000,00:48:30.958,Then I guess you're a very famous screenwriter.
00:48:31.041,00:48:33.958,Why don't we pretend I'm one of your characters?
00:48:34.958,00:48:37.500,Do you want me to act sweet or assertive?
00:48:38.041,00:48:39.250,How about sweet?
00:48:44.583,00:48:51.791,"I've been single for a while, but it's not because I was holding out for a car, a mansion, or anything else."
00:48:54.125,00:48:55.958,"Hey, how rich are you?"
00:48:56.041,00:48:56.875,You can tell me.
00:49:07.083,00:49:09.416,"No, you don't get it. Trust me, you'll love it."
00:49:09.500,00:49:11.458,-I've never been inside this. -Trust me.
00:49:12.208,00:49:14.833,Are you seriously still wearing your school uniform?
00:49:14.916,00:49:16.291,Can you believe this guy?
00:49:49.416,00:49:50.416,Who are you?
00:49:51.083,00:49:52.250,Sang Yu.
00:50:58.375,00:51:01.541,"We should go and see one of the movies that you've written, huh?"
00:51:04.916,00:51:06.500,Wouldn't that be a good idea?
00:51:07.166,00:51:09.000,I wanna see a story you've written.
00:51:32.666,00:51:33.958,"A mocha, please."
00:51:44.458,00:51:46.416,"Hey, what's going on?"
00:51:47.291,00:51:49.708,I thought you didn't need to write these anymore.
00:52:03.291,00:52:05.833,Do you want me to act sweet or assertive?
00:52:09.583,00:52:11.750,I usually dump three guys like you every year.
00:52:49.208,00:52:50.333,I'm dreaming!
00:53:01.416,00:53:03.041,What's in your hand?
00:53:04.375,00:53:05.500,"So, you read the script?"
00:53:10.625,00:53:11.833,It's wonderful!
00:53:11.916,00:53:13.125,So touching!
00:53:15.500,00:53:16.750,"I'll make 200,000!"
00:53:16.833,00:53:19.416,"Only 200,000? That's funny."
00:53:19.500,00:53:21.708,The screenwriter doesn't want money.
00:53:21.791,00:53:25.625,But he wants it done right. That means big stars for the romantic leads.
00:53:29.083,00:53:31.333,Are you serious? I'm only putting in five million.
00:53:31.416,00:53:32.625,I can't afford it.
00:53:33.208,00:53:34.541,What if I invest?
00:53:35.333,00:53:37.083,A hundred million.
00:53:39.916,00:53:49.625,"for many years, a promising young writer, he is now in the middle of an unprecedented wave of success by being recognized as one of China's most important filmmakers."
00:53:49.708,00:53:54.041,"A once in a generation visionary, he's become a major player in the industry."
00:53:56.625,00:53:58.083,I have other buyers.
00:53:58.166,00:54:03.416,"For one, I could sell it right at the price and force you to pay ten times more to get it."
00:54:06.916,00:54:07.916,a producer at seven.
00:54:08.000,00:54:11.250,He's been called the Shakespeare of Chinese Cinema.
00:54:11.333,00:54:19.625,"Already on the industry's radar during his college years, Sang Yu kept a low profile working behind the scenes with top directors."
00:54:21.166,00:54:22.625,"Sure, let's do it."
00:54:24.625,00:54:26.958,and expect the first payment tomorrow.
00:54:34.375,00:54:35.583,he chose to reject it.
00:54:35.666,00:54:39.416,"Instead, he focused on living a fulfilling and simple life."
00:54:39.500,00:54:45.250,So he gave up ownership of all his work and refused to participate in media coverage.
00:54:45.916,00:54:50.666,"Since then, he's traveled the world, collecting thousands of stories and honing his voice."
00:54:50.750,00:54:55.291,"This year, he has over 20 top film projects set to begin production."
00:54:55.375,00:55:01.250,"If think of Sang Yu as a big shot in the business… -Isn't this a little exaggerated? -Fake it 'till you make it, bro."
00:55:06.375,00:55:08.291,I wanna let you know I'm not as good as all that.
00:55:08.375,00:55:14.125,"For a long time, I couldn't write anything good because I didn't know why I was writing."
00:55:15.250,00:55:21.458,"But I think that now, I have found a pretty good reason. Thanks to that reason, I hope I never let you down."
00:55:21.541,00:55:22.708,Thanks again.
00:57:03.000,00:57:04.958,Not even Mike Tyson has one of these.
00:57:08.666,00:57:09.916,What's on your mind?
00:57:15.875,00:57:18.083,"Lately, I've come to realize something."
00:57:18.166,00:57:19.208,Uh-huh?
00:57:19.291,00:57:22.250,There are two kinds of people in this world who succeed.
00:57:23.166,00:57:26.166,"First group, they're traitors."
00:57:27.791,00:57:30.958,They are willing to betray the things that most people wouldn't.
00:57:31.625,00:57:34.458,"These people betray friendship, love, even family."
00:57:35.750,00:57:40.625,"In exchange for their betrayal, they get empty rewards they call success."
00:57:40.708,00:57:43.166,The other kind were called thieves.
00:57:43.958,00:57:45.333,Who think they're geniuses.
00:57:46.208,00:57:49.500,What else do you call someone whose invention changes the world?
00:57:51.125,00:57:53.250,But they haven't really invented anything.
00:57:54.750,00:57:57.625,All of their inventions are discoveries.
00:57:59.250,00:58:02.041,Made in a different reality that exists around us.
00:58:02.750,00:58:13.375,"Usually, you can't see it or feel it, but if you get the opportunity to see that world, perhaps take something you find back home, then you've really discovered something."
00:58:26.458,00:58:27.291,That's it.
00:58:27.958,00:58:29.708,I see what's happening here.
00:58:29.791,00:58:31.791,"Now, this is what God intended."
00:58:31.875,00:58:36.125,Huh? He chose you to use this power to help others.
00:58:37.666,00:58:40.125,I think I'm about to get philosophical myself.
00:58:40.750,00:58:46.541,"Throughout all of human history, there are few principal factors that have been a cause of misery."
00:58:46.625,00:58:48.708,"There are natural disasters, obviously."
00:58:48.791,00:58:50.458,and then there is war.
00:58:51.125,00:58:54.375,"So tell me, what's the main cause of war?"
00:58:55.375,00:58:56.541,Isn't it poverty?
00:58:57.208,00:59:01.208,"Therefore, if you eliminate poverty, you eliminate war."
00:59:01.291,00:59:03.708,"Seriously, you could be the one who does that."
00:59:04.458,00:59:06.333,We could build a skyscraper.
00:59:06.416,00:59:09.041,At least twice as tall as any in the world.
00:59:09.125,00:59:12.416,We'll invite all the starving and homeless people we can find.
00:59:12.500,00:59:14.791,"I'm talking refugees and pirates, everyone."
00:59:14.875,00:59:17.583,"We give them food, shelter, education, all free!"
00:59:17.666,00:59:19.958,We could build more buildings on every country!
00:59:20.791,00:59:25.625,"We pull this off, you'll win the Nobel Peace Prize every year!"
00:59:25.708,00:59:28.166,"You say the word, I'll get started on it now!"
00:59:29.041,00:59:31.416,"We're gonna change the world together, Sang Yu!"
00:59:47.750,00:59:48.833,"Hey, look over there."
00:59:49.333,01:00:02.791,"I once used to think it didn't matter to the city whether I existed or not But now, mostly because of you, I actually think I'm helping this city to shine, even brighter than before."
01:00:18.625,01:00:20.583,I feel truly alive.
01:00:22.958,01:00:24.875,I never would have dreamed I'd win you over.
01:00:26.000,01:00:30.958,"But spending these days together, is almost enough for me."
01:00:40.000,01:00:41.583,How long can we make this last?
01:00:42.458,01:00:43.333,Mm?
01:00:45.500,01:00:50.666,"From the moment you appeared, until the day you'll disappear?"
01:01:15.541,01:01:17.416,You probably don't remember me.
01:01:18.000,01:01:23.458,I use to skip class to go to the movies with you.
01:01:35.000,01:01:42.333,"If I were that same boy today, would you want to be with me?"
01:01:49.041,01:02:15.583,Mm… Sang Yu?
01:02:28.625,01:02:29.708,Sang Yu?
01:02:29.791,01:02:31.000,Are you okay?
01:02:33.000,01:02:33.958,Sang Yu?
01:03:43.583,01:03:45.083,"Oh, Sang Yu?"
01:03:46.625,01:03:47.583,Hey.
01:03:54.166,01:03:56.375,Why are you doing drinking in here all alone?
01:03:57.375,01:04:00.250,"Hey, why don't you come and join us out here?"
01:04:01.083,01:04:02.916,I'll make sure you have a good time.
01:04:03.000,01:04:03.958,I'm tired.
01:04:07.958,01:04:10.458,You and Hua'er getting to fight or something?
01:04:20.375,01:04:22.041,"These women, right?"
01:04:25.583,01:04:28.125,"suddenly, they want all your attention."
01:04:28.208,01:04:32.500,"Just when you think you found true love, suddenly, she was interested."
01:04:32.583,01:04:38.166,"So easy to think women are different, special, started to think she doesn't want anything from you."
01:04:38.250,01:04:40.041,"-But then-- -Hey, San."
01:04:40.125,01:04:41.041,Huh?
01:04:41.125,01:04:44.791,"You think after all we've taken, there might be karma?"
01:04:45.916,01:04:54.875,"Well, when you took something, you only took what was yours. You never stole from anyone."
01:04:54.958,01:04:56.333,Where is the karma in that?
01:04:56.416,01:04:58.416,"You didn't fight with Hua'er, did you?"
01:04:58.500,01:05:00.958,Do you remember that door I was telling you about?
01:05:02.125,01:05:08.833,"I'm starting to think… one day, I won't come back."
01:05:08.916,01:05:09.916,What are you saying?
01:05:10.000,01:05:12.250,That you'll got to sleep and never wake up?
01:05:13.166,01:05:15.416,You've been way too tired lately.
01:05:15.500,01:05:17.333,You desperately need sleep.
01:05:17.416,01:05:19.333,"Go to bed early tonight, huh?"
01:05:32.708,01:05:34.166,-What are you doing? -Mm?
01:05:34.958,01:05:46.083,Uh… I wanna sleep alone tonight.
01:05:49.250,01:05:50.291,Okay.
01:05:50.375,01:05:51.666,"No problem, I understand."
01:05:52.416,01:05:55.208,Get some rest. We'll pick this up tomorrow.
01:07:54.416,01:07:56.875,"just say, I'm only dreaming."
01:07:56.958,01:07:59.125,I'm only dreaming!
01:08:27.541,01:08:28.708,What are you doing?
01:08:58.500,01:08:59.958,"Stop fucking around, man."
01:09:00.791,01:09:02.125,I have important things to do.
01:09:02.208,01:09:04.166,"You've been doing pretty well, huh?"
01:09:04.875,01:09:06.000,You're a famous guy.
01:09:06.083,01:09:07.958,You don't need pawn shops anymore.
01:09:09.625,01:09:11.458,"Why don't we just go straight to it, shall we?"
01:09:12.833,01:09:14.375,How much do you want from me?
01:09:14.458,01:09:15.750,Five million.
01:09:15.833,01:09:17.041,I'll make a call.
01:09:19.666,01:09:20.958,Mr. Qiang.
01:09:21.041,01:09:22.291,Mr. Qiang.
01:09:23.291,01:09:24.458,"Hey, I was only… Hey!"
01:09:25.583,01:09:27.583,I wonder how much do you think you're worth?
01:09:28.333,01:09:29.791,Give me a price.
01:09:31.291,01:09:34.125,I'll give you… ten million Yuan.
01:09:36.333,01:09:37.458,That in cash?
01:09:38.583,01:09:40.125,Give him the phone.
01:10:08.333,01:10:16.208,Yeah. Why don't you tell me where he-- Where is he?
01:10:20.083,01:10:23.916,"Just so you know, I'm not really part of any of this."
01:10:24.000,01:10:27.833,I'm just delivering as a favor to a very good friend of mine.
01:10:29.125,01:10:33.833,The family was really pretty insisting that I'd see the hostage before you get the cash.
01:10:33.916,01:10:40.166,"So, if you take the money without my confirming my friend's safety, I mean… don't you think that would be kinda bad manners?"
01:10:45.666,01:10:46.500,Who is Hua'er?
01:10:47.250,01:10:48.416,Your little girlfriend?
01:10:49.375,01:10:50.208,Give it back.
01:10:56.916,01:10:59.000,No wonder you're so full of yourself.
01:10:59.083,01:11:05.833,"A million, ten million, a hundred million… In your savings alone, you have three hundred million."
01:11:05.916,01:11:07.250,What exactly do you do?
01:11:09.291,01:11:10.500,You know what I think?
01:11:10.583,01:11:12.250,I think I asked for too little.
01:11:12.333,01:11:13.333,Qiang.
01:11:14.833,01:11:16.458,There's something bad happening to me.
01:11:18.125,01:11:19.250,I won't be alive for long.
01:11:19.333,01:11:22.000,"Take the money, just let us go."
01:11:22.083,01:11:23.958,Let me take care of one last thing.
01:11:24.041,01:11:24.875,You can do that.
01:11:32.541,01:11:33.708,What's going on?
01:11:34.583,01:11:35.541,Sang Yu.
01:11:36.083,01:11:37.083,You all right?
01:11:37.166,01:11:38.750,What did these fuckers do to you?
01:11:38.833,01:11:41.708,"Do you have any idea who this is? Oh, you'll regret this."
01:11:41.791,01:11:49.875,"Wait and see what's gonna happen. Talking to you, mother-- San? San?"
01:11:49.958,01:11:51.875,All of your businesses and home.
01:11:51.958,01:11:53.875,Let's check out this guy's place.
01:11:57.916,01:11:59.958,"Hey, hello, Mr. Sang."
01:12:08.500,01:12:09.541,Is that Mr. San?
01:12:11.333,01:12:12.875,"What happened to him, huh?"
01:12:17.083,01:12:18.000,Delivery.
01:12:34.750,01:12:36.916,You already made a good life up here.
01:12:37.875,01:12:39.166,This can't be right.
01:12:40.333,01:12:41.458,"I don't buy it, Qiang."
01:12:41.541,01:12:43.791,There should be way more merchandise in here.
01:12:49.083,01:12:51.208,You can show yourself out when you finish.
01:12:51.708,01:12:54.708,"No problem. Maybe you can just call the owner, he can come get it."
01:13:42.625,01:13:45.166,Where the hell did you get all of these from?
01:13:48.625,01:13:50.000,I traded my life for it.
01:13:50.083,01:13:52.083,Who hasn't traded their life for money?
01:13:53.000,01:13:54.666,"Why is yours worth so much, huh?"
01:14:05.041,01:14:07.291,You can take all of it. It's okay.
01:14:07.375,01:14:08.833,I won't call the cops.
01:14:09.833,01:14:13.416,"But if you kill me, you're in for it."
01:14:15.000,01:14:19.166,A time thief can steal so much he could provide for the rest of his life.
01:14:19.791,01:14:22.750,"And yet, he's always a thief."
01:14:22.833,01:14:25.083,Who lies to himself and betrays what he is.
01:14:26.250,01:14:28.458,He'll never control his own destiny.
01:14:32.833,01:14:34.208,"Mr. Sang, are you there?"
01:14:36.041,01:14:38.000,"Mr. Sang, are you okay?"
01:14:46.750,01:14:48.333,-Should I let her up? -Say I'm not here.
01:14:48.416,01:14:49.916,-Tell her to come later. -Sang Yu?
01:14:50.625,01:14:52.958,Why can't you tell me what you're hiding from?
01:14:53.750,01:14:55.458,I'm hiding from you! Get out!
01:14:55.541,01:14:57.083,Leave now!
01:14:58.500,01:15:00.166,Is something going on up there?
01:15:02.916,01:15:04.791,-You can explain-- -Quiet!
01:15:05.958,01:15:07.916,Do you remember what you said to me?
01:15:08.000,01:15:10.458,How you can dump three guys like me in a year?
01:15:10.541,01:15:12.250,You can add me to that list today.
01:15:14.875,01:15:16.000,You know what I think?
01:15:17.666,01:15:20.208,I think this isn't about some regret in your past.
01:15:26.875,01:15:28.416,"Hang on, Ma'am."
01:15:29.125,01:15:31.000,He just opened the door.
01:15:44.291,01:15:46.375,Don't move! I'll snap you to death!
01:15:57.166,01:15:58.625,"Are you there, Sang Yu?"
01:15:59.875,01:16:01.083,Are you okay?
01:16:01.750,01:16:04.500,"Please, Sang Yu… Wait, stop!"
01:16:05.291,01:16:06.708,"If you take that off, you'll die."
01:16:10.208,01:16:12.875,What good is money without a girl to go with it?
01:16:14.250,01:16:15.541,What do you want?
01:16:15.625,01:16:17.166,"You want money, right?"
01:16:17.250,01:16:19.916,"I have a café, it's worth some money. You can have it."
01:16:26.458,01:16:28.208,Don't touch her! Get away from her!
01:16:34.083,01:16:36.125,Qiang. Qiang. Qiang.
01:16:36.958,01:16:38.125,"Qiang, I was wrong."
01:16:38.208,01:16:41.166,"Please, just let her go. You can take whatever you want."
01:16:41.250,01:16:44.458,"I have more stuff. I promise, there's more. Don't do it."
01:16:45.166,01:16:46.375,I'm begging you.
01:17:05.083,01:17:07.291,"You've never been down here, have you?"
01:17:10.666,01:17:12.958,Did he tell you what he does for a living?
01:17:14.375,01:17:16.000,Did he say he was a writer?
01:17:17.541,01:17:21.333,Do really think a writer can afford all of this?
01:17:21.916,01:17:23.125,Qiang.
01:17:23.208,01:17:26.750,"Qiang, you don't have to. Didn't we agree we take the money only?"
01:17:27.583,01:17:28.541,"Come on, man."
01:17:28.625,01:17:29.666,Stop!
01:17:31.500,01:17:32.500,Qiang.
01:17:33.041,01:17:34.875,We don't have to kill them.
01:17:38.166,01:17:39.375,Qiang. Qiang.
01:17:50.916,01:17:52.500,Why couldn't you just shut up?
01:17:57.541,01:18:03.041,There maybe people who suddenly appear in our lives they might seem like bad guys.
01:18:03.125,01:18:11.875,"So we make noise, and complain about our bad luck, without ever really considering how our own actions led us to this very moment."
01:18:11.958,01:18:14.041,These bad men are actually the good ones.
01:18:14.125,01:18:16.958,They come into our lives to teach us a lesson.
01:18:17.791,01:18:19.708,It's too late for him.
01:18:20.875,01:18:22.291,But you're a smart person.
01:18:50.541,01:18:52.125,You sons of bitches!
01:18:56.458,01:18:57.833,Sang Yu!
01:18:57.916,01:18:59.166,Have you all gone crazy?
01:19:02.333,01:19:03.500,Don't move!
01:19:08.625,01:19:10.583,"All of you, get back! Get back!"
01:19:13.583,01:19:14.625,Go after them.
01:19:28.125,01:19:29.666,Sang Yu! Sang Yu!
01:19:33.958,01:19:35.416,We need to get out of here.
01:19:48.541,01:19:49.458,Hurry!
01:24:29.458,01:24:32.125,"together, they form the human psyche."
01:24:32.208,01:24:36.416,"In everyday life, the ego controls how you see yourself in other people."
01:24:36.500,01:24:41.375,"But in dreams, it's the id that takes over and reveals our animal desires."
01:24:41.458,01:24:48.291,"And then the super-ego, the force that both holds the id at bay and keeps the ego from getting carried away with itself."
01:26:19.416,01:26:23.416,I'm… dreaming.
01:26:25.291,01:26:26.625,I'm dreaming.
01:26:28.250,01:26:29.875,I'm dreaming.
01:26:31.458,01:26:33.208,I'm only dreaming.
01:26:34.458,01:26:36.208,I'm only dreaming.
01:26:37.125,01:26:38.500,I'm only dreaming.
01:27:44.250,01:27:47.375,I have leftovers. Eat and get out! Don't you starve to death at my house!
01:27:57.625,01:28:00.750,"Do you think your writing is so special, huh?"
01:28:01.416,01:28:03.416,It should be easy money for you!
01:28:03.500,01:28:05.000,Pull yourself together!
01:29:42.208,01:29:45.875,I'm… dreaming.
01:30:12.083,01:30:13.083,Sang Yu?
01:30:17.833,01:30:18.916,Sang Yu?
01:30:30.333,01:30:31.541,Is it really you?
01:30:34.458,01:30:36.041,What happened?
01:30:41.958,01:30:43.208,You shouldn't eat this.
01:30:46.000,01:30:46.958,Come on.
01:30:47.958,01:30:49.500,Let's go get some real food.
01:30:52.208,01:30:53.541,You must be hungry.
01:30:53.625,01:30:54.708,You better eat up.
01:31:25.333,01:31:26.625,It'll be all right.
01:31:28.500,01:31:33.500,"You know, I was reading a magazine, there was a story written by someone named Sang Yu."
01:31:35.333,01:31:37.250,And I thought that must have been you.
01:31:37.750,01:31:39.666,It's the right thing for you to be a writer.
01:31:39.750,01:31:41.083,You're very special.
01:31:41.750,01:31:44.583,"You only need a little good luck, for a change."
01:31:50.541,01:31:52.666,I'm not able to help you out with much.
01:31:55.041,01:31:59.125,"But if it's something you want, you can work in my café."
01:33:00.541,01:33:01.583,Sang Yu.
01:33:03.083,01:33:04.125,This is for you.
01:33:13.875,01:33:15.125,It's too much.
01:33:16.375,01:33:18.916,Think of it as a kind of investment.
01:33:19.000,01:33:22.125,"You keep the profits, while I'll capitalize this."
01:33:24.541,01:33:26.208,I'm not sure I can even write a script.
01:33:26.291,01:33:28.375,I can never write what they want me to write.
01:33:28.458,01:33:31.458,"Well, then just write for yourself, huh?"
01:33:47.958,01:33:50.583,I think I've heard every excuse to extend a deadline.
01:33:50.666,01:33:52.500,Like those files getting lost.
01:33:53.166,01:33:55.375,Maybe you just got water on your computer.
01:33:56.500,01:33:58.958,That's what I get for dealing with creatives.
01:33:59.041,01:34:02.750,"But you are something else, some other next life."
01:34:04.000,01:34:05.416,I wanna apologize.
01:34:07.250,01:34:11.833,It's just that… I really can't write for you anymore.
01:34:12.541,01:34:16.750,"So, I borrowed ten thousand Yuan… to pay you back with."
01:34:17.791,01:34:19.083,"I'm sorry, my friend."
01:34:29.625,01:34:33.916,About that script you wrote from before… I sold it.
01:34:34.000,01:34:35.916,They said your writing was good.
01:34:36.625,01:34:41.208,Turns out… you should have been writing thrillers all along.
01:34:42.208,01:34:43.708,"Here, take it."
01:34:49.375,01:34:50.625,"Hey, who's the rich guy?"
01:34:52.375,01:34:54.500,You won't even buy me a bowl of noodles?
01:34:56.875,01:34:57.708,Hey.
01:35:04.958,01:35:07.708,that time can only move in one direction.
01:35:08.458,01:35:12.250,"But in dreams, we all become time travelers."
01:35:12.333,01:35:14.916,"Suddenly, there's nothing to hold us back."
01:35:15.458,01:35:18.000,Life contains infinite possibilities.
01:35:18.083,01:35:24.625,"Even if we think we know our own histories, on some other timeline, you might be living a completely different life."

01:36:15.458,01:36:17.083,Thanks for thinking of me.
01:36:17.166,01:36:19.541,I know what you traded for that money.

01:36:41.083,01:36:42.708,And I'm much happier this way.
01:37:59.541,01:38:00.500,Sang Yu?
01:38:02.250,01:38:03.583,Sang Yu?
01:38:07.583,01:38:08.791,You shouldn't eat this.
01:38:11.083,01:38:13.416,Come on. Let's go get some real food.
