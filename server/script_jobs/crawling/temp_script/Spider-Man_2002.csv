00:03:10.440,00:03:13.401,The story of my life is not for the faint of heart.
00:03:13.401,00:03:23.328,"If somebody said it was a happy little tale, if somebody told you I was just your average, ordinary guy, not a care in the world, somebody lied."
00:03:23.328,00:03:29.960,"But let me assure you, this, like any story worth telling, is all about a girl."
00:03:29.960,00:03:32.587,MAN: That girl.
00:03:32.587,00:03:37.509,"Mary Jane Watson, the woman I've loved since before I even liked girls."
00:03:37.509,00:03:40.595,I'd like to tell you that's me next to her.
00:03:40.595,00:03:42.556,"Heck, I'd even take him."
00:03:44.599,00:03:46.852,Hey! Stop the bus!
00:03:46.852,00:03:48.896,MAN: That's me.
00:03:48.896,00:03:50.898,Tell him to stop!
00:03:50.898,00:03:54.943,Stop! Hey!
00:03:54.943,00:03:59.406,Stop the bus! He's been chasing us since Woodhaven Boulevard.
00:04:03.077,00:04:05.079,Thank you.
00:04:13.503,00:04:15.463,Don't even think about it.

00:04:53.543,00:04:56.379,Let's not have a repeat of our trip to the Planetarium.
00:04:56.379,00:04:58.465,"Come on, people, let's stay together."
00:04:58.465,00:05:00.341,Proceed up the steps and into the building.

00:05:12.980,00:05:15.649,Why? The entrance is right there.
00:05:15.649,00:05:17.651,"Dad, these are public school kids."
00:05:17.651,00:05:20.654,I'm not showing up for the field trip in the Rolls.
00:05:20.654,00:05:26.201,"What, you want me to trade in my car for a Jetta, because you flunked out of every private school I sent you to?"
00:05:26.201,00:05:28.369,It wasn't for me.
00:05:29.788,00:05:31.790,Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.
00:05:31.790,00:05:33.458,I'm not ashamed of who I am.
00:05:34.626,00:05:37.420,It's just...
00:05:37.420,00:05:39.506,Forget it.
00:05:40.548,00:05:42.425,Pete.
00:05:42.425,00:05:44.385,"Hi ya, Harry."
00:05:44.385,00:05:46.305,"Hey, man. What's up?"
00:05:46.305,00:05:49.348,Won't you be needing this?
00:05:49.348,00:05:51.810,"Uh, Peter, may I introduce my father, Norman Osborn."
00:05:51.810,00:05:54.146,NORMAN: I've heard so much about you.
00:05:54.146,00:05:55.981,"A great honor to meet you, Sir."
00:05:55.981,00:05:58.357,NORMAN: Harry tells me you're quite the science whiz.
00:05:58.357,00:06:01.028,"You know, I'm something of a scientist myself."
00:06:01.028,00:06:03.488,I read all your research on nanotechnology.
00:06:03.488,00:06:05.324,Really brilliant.
00:06:05.324,00:06:08.076,Yes.
00:06:08.076,00:06:10.704,Impressive. Your parents must be very proud.
00:06:10.704,00:06:12.622,I live with my aunt and uncle.
00:06:12.622,00:06:14.041,"TEACHER: Hey, you two!"
00:06:14.041,00:06:17.002,Let's move!
00:06:17.002,00:06:19.046,Hope to see you again.
00:06:21.631,00:06:23.591,He doesn't seem so bad.
00:06:23.591,00:06:25.593,"Yeah, not if you're a genius."

00:07:25.445,00:07:28.573,Or his father'll fire your father.
00:07:28.573,00:07:31.201,"What's daddy gonna do, sue me?"
00:07:31.201,00:07:33.412,What is going on?
00:07:33.412,00:07:35.538,The next person who talks will fail this course.

00:07:57.852,00:08:00.814,It's a defense mechanism.
00:08:00.814,00:08:03.524,"Peter, what makes you think I would want to know that?"
00:08:03.524,00:08:05.610,Who wouldn't?

00:08:27.466,00:08:33.972,"You know, spiders can change their color to blend into their environment."
00:08:33.972,00:08:35.932,Really?
00:08:35.932,00:08:38.185,"Yeah, it's a, uh, defense mechanism."

00:08:56.036,00:08:58.121,HARRY: Yeah.
00:09:00.540,00:09:03.543,I guess the researchers are working on that one.
00:09:03.543,00:09:08.673,Do you know that this is the largest electron microscope on the eastern seaboard?
00:09:08.673,00:09:12.344,You were talking throughout that woman's entire presentation.
00:09:12.344,00:09:14.846,Let's go talk about how we listen.
00:09:18.766,00:09:31.946,"Now, I don't know what it's like at those fancy private schools, Osborn, but at Midtown High-- Hey."
00:09:32.906,00:09:34.615,Could I take your picture?
00:09:34.615,00:09:36.117,I-I need one with a student in it.
00:09:36.117,00:09:40.330,Sure. Yeah.
00:09:40.330,00:09:43.083,Over here?
00:09:43.083,00:09:45.126,Don't make me look ugly.
00:09:45.126,00:09:47.128,That's impossible.
00:09:52.926,00:09:55.887,"Oh, perfect."
00:10:03.144,00:10:05.063,Is that good?
00:10:10.527,00:10:13.029,That's great.
00:10:16.991,00:10:20.245,"GIRL: M.J., let's go!"
00:10:20.245,00:10:23.915,Wait-- Thanks.
00:10:25.208,00:10:27.668,Ow!
00:10:36.844,00:10:39.889,TEACHER: Parker. Let's do it.
00:10:56.364,00:10:59.993,We solved the horizon glide and the multi-G balance issues.
00:10:59.993,00:11:04.789,I've already seen the glider.
00:11:04.789,00:11:07.667,"General Slocum, good to see you again."
00:11:08.751,00:11:11.171,Mr. Balkan.
00:11:11.171,00:11:13.089,Norman.
00:11:13.089,00:11:16.384,Always a pleasure to have our board of directors pay us a little visit.
00:11:16.384,00:11:19.971,I want to see the progress report on human performance enhancers.
00:11:19.971,00:11:22.056,We tried vapor inhalation with rodent subjects.
00:11:22.056,00:11:24.142,They showed an 800 percent increase in strength.
00:11:24.142,00:11:26.019,Eight hundred percent?
00:11:26.019,00:11:28.355,Any side effects?
00:11:28.355,00:11:29.814,It was an aberration.
00:11:29.814,00:11:31.858,All the tests since then have been successful.
00:11:31.858,00:11:33.943,"And in the trial that went wrong, what happened?"
00:11:33.943,00:11:35.445,What were the side effects?
00:11:35.445,00:11:37.864,"Uh, violence, aggression..."
00:11:37.864,00:11:40.200,and insanity.
00:11:40.200,00:11:41.535,And what do you recommend?
00:11:41.535,00:11:42.785,That was only one test.
00:11:42.785,00:11:48.375,"With the exception of Dr. Stromm, our entire staff certifies the product ready for human testing."
00:11:48.375,00:11:50.918,Dr. Stromm?
00:11:50.918,00:11:53.338,We need to take the whole line back to formula.
00:11:55.256,00:11:57.300,Back to formula?
00:11:57.300,00:12:01.513,Dr. Osborn? I'm going to be frank with you.
00:12:01.513,00:12:04.098,I never supported your program.
00:12:04.098,00:12:06.393,We have my predecessor to thank for that.
00:12:06.393,00:12:12.731,"Norman, the general gave the go-ahead to Quest Aerospace to build a prototype of their exoskeleton design."
00:12:12.731,00:12:14.775,They test in two weeks.
00:12:14.775,00:12:22.909,"And if your so-called performance enhancers have not had a successful human trial by that date, I'm gonna pull your funding."
00:12:22.909,00:12:24.952,I'm going to give it to them.
00:12:27.455,00:12:29.416,Gentlemen. Ladies.
00:12:33.503,00:12:36.130,"BEN: And the lord said, Let there be light."
00:12:36.130,00:12:39.676,"And voila, there is light."
00:12:39.676,00:12:42.011,Forty soft-glowin' watts of it.
00:12:42.011,00:12:44.639,Good boy.
00:12:44.639,00:12:46.725,Just don't fall on your ass.
00:12:46.725,00:12:49.686,"I'm already on my ass, May."
00:12:49.686,00:12:57.193,"When the plant's senior electrician is laid off after- after 35 years, what else would you call it?"
00:12:57.193,00:12:59.613,"Hand me that dish, the green one."
00:12:59.613,00:13:04.867,"Corporation is downsizing the people, and upsizing their profits."
00:13:04.867,00:13:08.455,"Ah, Ben, you'll get another job somewhere."
00:13:08.455,00:13:12.500,"Yeah, well, let's look in the paper and see."
00:13:13.834,00:13:16.546,Here are the want ads.
00:13:16.546,00:13:25.764,"Computer-- computer salesman, computer engineer, computer analyst-- My lord, even the computers need analysts these days."
00:13:25.764,00:13:28.767,"May, I'm 68 years old."
00:13:28.767,00:13:31.770,"And besides, I have a family to provide for."
00:13:31.770,00:13:34.731,"I love you, and Peter loves you."
00:13:34.731,00:13:38.401,You're the most responsible man I've ever known.
00:13:38.401,00:13:42.905,"We've been down and out before, but somehow we've survived."
00:13:42.905,00:13:44.658,"Oh, hi, sweetie."
00:13:44.658,00:13:47.826,You're just-just...
00:13:47.826,00:13:51.205,"Hey, how you doin', buddy?"
00:13:51.205,00:13:53.792,I don't feel well.
00:13:53.792,00:13:56.711,You won't have a bite?
00:13:56.711,00:13:59.213,"D-d-did you get some pictures, Peter?"
00:13:59.213,00:14:02.342,"Uh, I gotta crash."
00:14:04.093,00:14:06.053,What's that all about?
00:14:26.574,00:14:32.205,"GUIDE: In this recombination lab, we use synthesized transfer R.N.A."

00:14:58.732,00:15:00.817,The performance enhancers aren't ready.
00:15:00.817,00:15:04.487,The data just doesn't justify this test.
00:15:04.487,00:15:08.282,"Now, I'm asking you for the last time. We can't do this."
00:15:08.282,00:15:10.869,Don't be a coward.
00:15:10.869,00:15:13.496,Risks are part of laboratory science.
00:15:13.496,00:15:17.876,Let me reschedule with a proper medical staff and a volunteer.
00:15:17.876,00:15:20.086,If you just give me two weeks-- Two weeks?
00:15:20.086,00:15:24.716,"In two weeks we'll have lost the contract to Quest, and Oscorp will be dead."
00:15:24.716,00:15:27.385,Sometimes you gotta do things yourself.
00:15:27.385,00:15:29.387,Get me the promachloraperazine.
00:15:29.387,00:15:31.389,For what?
00:15:31.389,00:15:34.517,It begins catalyzation when the vapor hits the bloodstream.
00:15:37.186,00:15:43.109,"Forty thousand years of evolution, and we've barely even tapped the vastness of human potential."
00:15:56.289,00:15:58.332,That's cold.

00:17:02.730,00:17:04.899,Norman!
00:17:04.899,00:17:07.067,Norman!
00:17:14.534,00:17:17.119,Oh my God.
00:17:17.119,00:17:20.122,Oh my God.
00:17:21.248,00:17:23.292,Oh my God.

00:17:39.141,00:17:40.894,Back to formula?
00:18:15.887,00:18:17.889,Weird.
00:18:27.481,00:18:29.400,MAY: Peter!
00:18:29.400,00:18:31.277,Yeah?
00:18:31.277,00:18:35.865,Uh...I'm fine.
00:18:35.865,00:18:37.951,Any better this morning?
00:18:37.951,00:18:39.827,Change?
00:18:39.827,00:18:41.996,Yeah.
00:18:41.996,00:18:45.041,"Well, hurry up!"
00:18:45.041,00:18:47.043,Right.
00:19:04.560,00:19:06.353,Okay.
00:19:10.858,00:19:12.860,MAY: Goodness me!
00:19:12.860,00:19:14.570,I thought you were sick.
00:19:14.570,00:19:15.905,I got better.
00:19:15.905,00:19:17.615,"Bye, guys."

00:28:40.302,00:28:43.805,The dishes are not done.
00:28:43.805,00:28:46.808,Why don't you do 'em for a change?
00:28:46.808,00:28:51.397,"MAN: Get in here, girl, and do the dishes now. I'm going out."
00:28:51.397,00:28:53.440,Were you listening to that?

00:28:55.359,00:28:58.445,"Well, I heard, but I was just taking out the trash."
00:28:58.445,00:29:00.531,I guess you can always hear us.
00:29:00.531,00:29:03.492,"Well, e-everybody shouts."

00:29:37.693,00:29:44.241,"Hopefully, uh, get a job as a photographer, work my way through college."
00:29:46.243,00:29:48.287,What about you?
00:29:48.287,00:29:50.205,Headed for the city too.

00:30:06.930,00:30:09.308,act...
00:30:09.308,00:30:11.393,on stage.
00:30:11.393,00:30:13.687,Really?
00:30:13.687,00:30:15.897,"Well, that's perfect."
00:30:15.897,00:30:18.692,You were awesome in all the school plays.
00:30:18.692,00:30:20.444,Really?
00:30:21.987,00:30:24.448,I cried like a baby when you played Cinderella.
00:30:24.448,00:30:27.284,"Peter, that was first grade."
00:30:27.284,00:30:31.789,"Well, even so."
00:30:31.789,00:30:34.458,Sometimes...
00:30:34.458,00:30:36.418,you know people.
00:30:37.670,00:30:41.006,You can just...
00:30:43.883,00:30:46.886,What do you see coming for you?
00:30:49.556,00:30:51.558,I don't know.
00:30:53.769,00:30:58.315,"Whatever it is, it's something I never felt before."
00:31:01.985,00:31:04.988,And...what for me?
00:31:04.988,00:31:07.032,PETER: For you?
00:31:07.032,00:31:09.493,You're gonna light up Broadway.
00:31:11.870,00:31:19.837,"You know, you're taller than you look."
00:31:19.837,00:31:22.589,I hunch.
00:31:24.216,00:31:26.468,Don't.
00:31:30.723,00:31:33.183,Come take a ride in my new birthday present.
00:31:33.183,00:31:35.227,FLASH: Come on.
00:31:36.353,00:31:38.689,I gotta go.
00:31:38.689,00:31:41.024,Bye.
00:31:41.024,00:31:44.236,"Oh my God, it's gorgeous!"
00:31:44.236,00:31:47.197,Hop in.
00:31:47.197,00:31:49.825,"Pretty tight, huh?"
00:31:49.825,00:31:52.202,Wait till you hear the sound system.
00:31:52.202,00:31:54.454,"Hey, don't scratch the leather."
00:31:54.454,00:31:56.498,FLASH: Whoo-hoo!
00:33:26.880,00:33:28.298,MAY: Peter?
00:33:30.216,00:33:32.845,What's-- what's going on in there?
00:33:32.845,00:33:35.180,I'm exercising.
00:33:35.180,00:33:39.017,"Well, you're acting so strangely, Peter."
00:33:39.017,00:33:41.269,Okay. Thanks.
00:34:11.925,00:34:13.426,Something's bothering him.
00:34:13.426,00:34:15.470,Maybe he's too embarrassed to tell me what it is.
00:34:15.470,00:34:18.431,Maybe I'm too embarrassed to ask him. You think?
00:34:18.431,00:34:21.059,I don't know.
00:34:21.059,00:34:23.729,Going to the downtown library.
00:34:23.729,00:34:25.814,"Yeah, wait, Pete."
00:34:25.814,00:34:27.357,"Oh, no, I'll take the train."
00:34:27.357,00:34:30.360,"No, no, no. I need the exercise."
00:34:41.872,00:34:43.206,"Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben."
00:34:43.206,00:34:45.709,"Wait a minute, Peter."
00:34:45.709,00:34:48.211,We can talk later.
00:34:48.211,00:34:50.129,If you'd let me.
00:34:50.129,00:34:52.674,What do we have to talk about?
00:34:52.674,00:34:57.387,"Because we haven't talked for so long, your Aunt May and I don't even know who you are anymore."
00:34:57.387,00:35:06.813,"You shirk your chores, you have all those weird experiments in your room, you start fights at school-- I didn't start that fight."
00:35:06.813,00:35:08.398,"Well, you sure as hell finished it."
00:35:08.398,00:35:10.025,"What was I supposed to do, run away?"
00:35:10.025,00:35:15.196,"No, you're not supposed to run away, but-- Pete, look, you're changing."
00:35:15.196,00:35:18.283,I went through exactly the same thing at your age.
00:35:18.283,00:35:20.077,No. Not exactly.
00:35:20.077,00:35:28.585,"Peter, these are the years when a man changes into the man he's going to become the rest of his life."
00:35:28.585,00:35:31.004,Just be careful who you change into.
00:35:33.172,00:35:37.844,"This guy Flash Thompson, he probably deserved what happened."
00:35:37.844,00:35:41.180,But just because you can beat him up...
00:35:41.180,00:35:43.892,doesn't give you the right to.
00:35:43.892,00:35:50.065,"Remember, with great power comes great responsibility."
00:35:50.065,00:35:52.943,Are you afraid I'm going to turn into some kind of criminal?
00:35:52.943,00:35:55.028,Quit worrying about me.
00:35:55.028,00:35:57.030,Something's different.
00:35:57.030,00:35:58.782,"Stop lecturing me, please."
00:35:58.782,00:36:03.369,"I don't mean to lecture, and I don't mean to preach, and I know I'm not your father."
00:36:03.369,00:36:05.455,Then stop pretending to be.
00:36:09.751,00:36:11.753,Right.
00:36:14.131,00:36:16.842,I'll pick you up here at 10:00.

00:39:56.394,00:40:02.567,ANNOUNCER: Will the guards please lock the cage doors at this time?
00:40:02.567,00:40:05.362,"Hey, listen, there's some kind of mistake."
00:40:05.362,00:40:07.488,I didn't sign up for a cage match!
00:40:07.488,00:40:11.243,Hey! Unlock the thing!
00:40:11.243,00:40:13.203,"Hey, freak show!"

00:40:28.676,00:40:30.387,Staying away from you.
00:40:30.387,00:40:33.848,That's a cute outfit. Did your husband give it to you?
00:40:41.480,00:40:43.066,WOMAN: Finish him off!
00:40:45.526,00:40:47.570,Aah!

00:41:51.550,00:41:54.679,A hundred bucks?
00:41:54.679,00:41:57.390,"Well, check it again, web-head."
00:41:57.390,00:42:01.394,It said three grand for three minutes. You pinned him in two.
00:42:01.394,00:42:04.522,"For that I give you a hundred, and you're lucky to get that."
00:42:04.522,00:42:06.565,I need that money.
00:42:06.565,00:42:09.986,I missed the part where that's my problem.
00:42:17.660,00:42:21.456,"Hey, what the hell-- Put the money in the bag."
00:42:22.665,00:42:24.334,MAN: Hurry up!
00:42:29.547,00:42:32.842,Hey! He stole the gate!

00:42:37.889,00:42:39.849,Thanks!
00:42:39.849,00:42:43.436,What the hell's the matter with you? You let him go!
00:42:43.436,00:42:45.897,"GUARD: Cut him off in the lobby, then call the cops!"
00:42:45.897,00:42:47.357,You could've taken that guy apart.
00:42:47.357,00:42:49.775,Now he's gonna get away with my money.
00:42:49.775,00:42:52.153,I missed the part where that's my problem.
00:43:10.838,00:43:12.673,"OFFICER: Sir, you gotta get back."
00:43:12.673,00:43:14.759,"Get back, all right?"
00:43:14.759,00:43:17.345,"MAN: Old dude, man."
00:43:17.345,00:43:20.681,"OFFICER: Come on, folks, keep movin'."
00:43:20.681,00:43:22.600,"Yo, what happened?"
00:43:22.600,00:43:24.436,MAN: Someone got hurt.
00:43:24.436,00:43:26.771,WOMAN: How? There's someone down.

00:43:31.526,00:43:33.778,That's my uncle!
00:43:33.778,00:43:36.781,What happened?
00:43:36.781,00:43:39.492,We just called the paramedics.
00:43:39.492,00:43:41.494,"Hey, hey, stay back."
00:43:41.494,00:43:44.497,Uncle Ben? Uncle Ben?
00:43:48.501,00:43:50.503,Uncle Ben?
00:43:53.339,00:43:55.633,Peter.
00:43:55.633,00:43:57.676,"I'm here, Uncle Ben."
00:44:02.807,00:44:04.809,Peter.
00:44:26.122,00:44:28.166,OFFICER: They got the shooter.
00:44:28.166,00:44:30.126,He's headed south on Fifth Avenue.
00:44:30.126,00:44:32.128,We got three cars in pursuit.
00:44:32.128,00:44:35.006,"All right, folks, help us out."
00:46:08.725,00:46:11.102,Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
00:47:10.953,00:47:14.039,OFFICER: Get a unit around to the rear of the building!
00:47:16.626,00:47:18.628,OFFICER: I got the back!
00:47:30.847,00:47:32.809,Who's there?
00:47:58.835,00:48:02.004,Don't hurt me. Just give me a chance. Just give me a chance!
00:48:02.004,00:48:05.090,What about my uncle?
00:48:05.090,00:48:06.967,Did you?
00:48:06.967,00:48:08.969,Answer me!
00:48:11.138,00:48:13.182,Stop that guy!
00:48:18.145,00:48:20.064,Thanks!
00:48:28.155,00:48:31.033,See ya.
00:48:33.285,00:48:36.205,No!
00:48:52.680,00:48:56.933,OFFICER: Freeze! We've got the place completely surrounded!
00:49:55.284,00:49:57.369,Good evening.
00:49:57.369,00:49:59.330,Good to see you.
00:49:59.330,00:50:02.249,"Our exoskeleton's got real firepower, General Slocum."
00:50:02.249,00:50:06.211,"Well, if it does what you say it can, I'll sign that contract tomorrow."
00:50:06.211,00:50:09.047,"WOMAN: Eighteen, seventeen, sixteen..."
00:50:09.047,00:50:11.843,SLOCUM: I assume you're confident about this test.
00:50:11.843,00:50:14.303,Absolutely.
00:50:14.303,00:50:17.849,"Now, what about your commitment to Oscorp?"
00:50:17.849,00:50:21.853,Nothing would please me more than to put Norman Osborn out of business.
00:50:24.271,00:50:27.191,Preflight complete.
00:50:30.611,00:50:33.405,AIR CONTROL: We're picking up an unidentified object.
00:50:33.405,00:50:34.824,What the hell is that?
00:50:34.824,00:50:36.909,AIR CONTROL: Can you see anything?
00:50:36.909,00:50:38.995,"Oh, my God."
00:50:48.838,00:50:52.884,Say Chess!
00:50:52.884,00:50:54.134,Peter!
00:50:54.134,00:50:56.428,"Oh, darling, I'm so proud of you."
00:50:56.428,00:51:00.016,You looked so handsome up there.
00:51:00.016,00:51:02.643,My father got the place in New York. We're all set this fall.
00:51:02.643,00:51:04.353,That's great.
00:51:06.814,00:51:09.859,This is not the first time I've been proven wrong.
00:51:11.360,00:51:14.321,Congratulations.
00:51:14.321,00:51:16.908,"Peter, the Science Award."
00:51:16.908,00:51:18.743,Yeah.
00:51:21.495,00:51:27.752,"I know this has been a difficult time for you, but I want you to try to enjoy this day."
00:51:27.752,00:51:29.754,Commencement.
00:51:29.754,00:51:33.841,"The end of one thing, the start of something new."
00:51:35.760,00:51:38.387,M.J.: I don't need you anymore.
00:51:38.387,00:51:40.806,Here's your ring.
00:51:40.806,00:51:45.019,You know what? Whatever.
00:51:45.019,00:51:47.021,NORMAN: You're like a brother to him.
00:51:47.021,00:51:49.648,That makes you family.
00:51:49.648,00:51:53.151,"If you ever need anything, just give me a call."
00:52:05.623,00:52:08.500,Can I-- can I fix you something?
00:52:08.500,00:52:10.711,"No, thanks."
00:52:55.506,00:52:57.925,I missed him a lot today.
00:53:00.302,00:53:02.262,I know.
00:53:03.806,00:53:05.808,I miss him too.
00:53:07.183,00:53:09.394,But he was there.
00:53:12.773,00:53:15.191,I can't help thinking about...
00:53:16.401,00:53:18.403,the last thing I said to him.
00:53:18.403,00:53:23.408,"He tried to tell me something important, and I threw it in his face."
00:53:25.036,00:53:27.038,You loved him.
00:53:28.873,00:53:30.248,And he loved you.
00:53:31.834,00:53:38.883,"He never doubted the man you'd grow into, how you were meant for great things."
00:53:39.884,00:53:41.927,You won't disappoint him.
00:54:15.251,00:54:17.462,BEN: With great power...
00:54:17.462,00:54:19.757,comes great responsibility.
00:54:19.757,00:54:22.760,"Remember that, Pete."
00:54:33.020,00:54:34.438,MAN: Hurry up!
00:54:46.491,00:54:50.788,This is not a man. My brother saw him building a nest in the Lincoln Center fountain.
00:54:50.788,00:54:53.958,I think he's human. I think he's a man. Could be a woman.
00:54:57.836,00:54:59.964,"Tommy, get a load of this."
00:55:01.882,00:55:03.926,Whoo!
00:55:03.926,00:55:07.930,"Throws up his hands, ropes come out, and he climbs up the ropes like a spider web."
00:55:07.930,00:55:10.641,WOMAN: I see the web It's his signature.
00:55:10.641,00:55:12.726,And I know Spider-Man was here.
00:55:12.726,00:55:15.562,MAN: The guy protects us.
00:55:15.562,00:55:18.440,"Ah, some kind of freaky-loo or somethin'. Wack-a-doo."
00:55:18.440,00:55:20.776,"He stinks, and I don't like him."
00:55:20.776,00:55:23.946,"Don't move, lady."
00:55:30.535,00:55:33.705,Guy with eight hands.
00:55:33.705,00:55:52.724,He has those tights and that tight little-- Who is Spider-Man?
00:55:52.724,00:55:54.476,"He's a criminal, that's who he is."
00:55:54.476,00:55:56.895,A vigilante. A public menace.
00:55:58.647,00:56:04.736,"RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Jameson, your wife is on line one-- There's a page-six problem."
00:56:04.736,00:56:06.488,Shut up. Well?
00:56:06.488,00:56:09.116,They're important clients that can't wait.
00:56:09.116,00:56:10.450,They're about to.
00:56:10.450,00:56:12.119,He pulled six people off that subway car.
00:56:12.119,00:56:13.829,"Sure, from a wreck he probably caused."
00:56:13.829,00:56:16.207,Something goes wrong and this creepy crawler is there.
00:56:16.207,00:56:17.624,"Look, he's fleeing the scene."
00:56:17.624,00:56:19.835,What's that tell ya?
00:56:19.835,00:56:22.378,He's probably going to save somebody else. He's a hero!
00:56:22.378,00:56:25.507,Then why does he wear a mask?
00:56:25.507,00:56:29.053,She just needs to know if you want the chintz or the chenille in the dining room.
00:56:29.053,00:56:31.555,Whichever one's cheaper.
00:56:31.555,00:56:37.186,"We double-booked page six, so both Macy's and Conway's both have three-quarters-- ROBBIE: We sold out four printings."
00:56:37.186,00:56:39.313,Sold out?
00:56:39.313,00:56:41.982,"Tomorrow morning, Spider-Man, page one, with a decent picture."
00:56:41.982,00:56:44.609,Move Conway's to page seven.
00:56:44.609,00:56:46.862,Then make it page eight and give 'em ten percent off.
00:56:46.862,00:56:48.030,Make it five percent.
00:56:48.030,00:56:49.990,That can't be done-- Get out of here!
00:56:49.990,00:56:52.659,We don't have a decent picture.
00:56:52.659,00:56:54.203,We can barely get a glimpse of him.
00:56:54.203,00:56:56.621,"Aww. What, is he shy?"
00:56:56.621,00:57:01.043,"If we can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a thong, we can certainly get a picture of this weirdo."
00:57:01.043,00:57:04.546,"Put an ad on the front page, Cash money for a picture of Spider-Man."
00:57:04.546,00:57:08.175,He doesn't want to be famous?
00:57:18.810,00:57:22.898,Hey!
00:57:22.898,00:57:25.234,"M.J., it's me, Peter."
00:57:25.234,00:57:26.902,Hey.
00:57:26.902,00:57:28.737,What are you doing around here?
00:57:28.737,00:57:31.031,I'm begging for a job.
00:57:31.031,00:57:35.202,"Oh, uh-- I'm headed to an audition."
00:57:35.202,00:57:37.829,So you're acting now?
00:57:37.829,00:57:41.417,I work steady.
00:57:41.417,00:57:42.751,"That's great, M.J."
00:57:42.751,00:57:45.587,You're doing it.
00:57:45.587,00:57:46.880,"Hey, glamour girl!"
00:57:46.880,00:57:48.715,Your drawer was short six dollars!
00:57:48.715,00:57:51.635,"Next time that happens, I'm gonna take it out of your check!"
00:57:52.594,00:57:54.721,"Excuse me, Miss Watson!"
00:57:54.721,00:57:56.390,I'm talkin' to you!
00:57:56.390,00:57:58.809,"Yes, Enrique! Okay?"
00:57:58.809,00:58:01.312,"Well, it better not happen no more, you hear me?"
00:58:01.312,00:58:02.896,Don't roll your eyes at me!
00:58:09.445,00:58:11.238,"Some dream, huh?"
00:58:12.614,00:58:14.992,That's nothing to be embarrassed about.
00:58:14.992,00:58:17.619,Don't tell Harry.
00:58:17.619,00:58:20.622,Aren't you guys living together?
00:58:20.622,00:58:22.374,We're going out.
00:58:23.625,00:58:25.543,"Oh, yeah, right."
00:58:25.543,00:58:28.797,I-I-I think he'd hate the idea of my waiting tables.
00:58:28.797,00:58:30.882,He'd think it was low or something.
00:58:30.882,00:58:33.385,That's not low.
00:58:33.385,00:58:35.595,You know Harry...
00:58:35.595,00:58:37.889,he doesn't live on a little place I like to call Earth.
00:58:39.516,00:58:41.435,"No, I-I guess not."
00:58:45.397,00:58:47.399,"Thanks, Pete."
00:58:48.984,00:58:51.320,We should catch up sometime.
00:58:55.199,00:58:56.700,Let's get some lunch some evening.
00:58:56.700,00:59:03.581,"Uh-- Well, I'll-I-I'll come by and have some of your Moondance coffee someday."
00:59:03.581,00:59:05.542,And I won't tell Harry.
00:59:05.542,00:59:08.212,"No, don't tell Harry."
00:59:09.921,00:59:11.923,I won't tell Harry.
00:59:23.227,00:59:25.812,Timing's perfect.
00:59:25.812,00:59:28.524,Five new contracts.
00:59:31.109,00:59:34.238,Stormin' Norman's making his weekly inspection.
00:59:34.238,00:59:37.074,He's spent half of it on the phone.
00:59:37.074,00:59:40.118,I'm glad you're here.
00:59:40.118,00:59:42.579,I'm really lost here.
00:59:42.579,00:59:44.664,Are you all right?
00:59:44.664,00:59:49.044,You look like you got second place in the science fair.
00:59:49.044,00:59:54.883,"No, I, uh-- I was late for work and Dr. Connors fired me."
00:59:54.883,00:59:56.801,You were late again?
00:59:56.801,00:59:59.971,I don't get it.
01:00:01.056,01:00:02.682,Around.
01:00:02.682,01:00:06.437,Peter Parker. Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
01:00:06.437,01:00:07.771,Who's that?
01:00:07.771,01:00:10.399,This girl Harry's been dating.
01:00:10.399,01:00:12.401,When do I get to meet her?
01:00:12.401,01:00:14.778,"Well, sorry, Harry hasn't mentioned her."
01:00:18.240,01:00:22.119,"Hey, Pete, you're probably looking for a job now, right?"
01:00:22.119,01:00:24.580,"Dad, maybe you can help him out."
01:00:24.580,01:00:27.374,"No, I-I appreciate it, but I'll be fine."
01:00:27.374,01:00:29.084,It's no problem.
01:00:29.084,01:00:31.169,"I couldn't accept it, Sir."
01:00:31.169,01:00:34.047,I like to earn what I get.
01:00:34.047,01:00:36.967,I respect that.
01:00:36.967,01:00:41.221,You want to make it on your own steam. That's great.
01:00:41.221,01:00:43.974,"What other skills do you have, Parker?"
01:00:43.974,01:00:46.851,I was thinking of something in photography.
01:00:48.895,01:00:51.356,BURGLAR: Hello.
01:00:51.356,01:00:54.067,Let's go! Move it!
01:00:55.652,01:00:57.695,Watch the street.
01:00:58.905,01:01:00.907,Whoo!
01:01:12.836,01:01:15.046,Cheese!
01:01:22.720,01:01:24.722,J. JONAH: They're crap.
01:01:24.722,01:01:27.309,Crap. Crap. Mega-crap.
01:01:27.309,01:01:28.893,I'll give you 200 bucks for all of 'em.
01:01:28.893,01:01:31.355,That seems a little low.
01:01:33.190,01:01:36.485,"RECEPTIONIST: Sir, the tile you ordered is out of stock."
01:01:36.485,01:01:39.363,Tell her we'll just put a rug there. Sit down. Give me that.
01:01:41.031,01:01:43.367,I'll give you 300. That's the standard freelance fee.
01:01:43.367,01:01:44.701,Tear up page one.
01:01:44.701,01:01:46.578,Run that photo instead.
01:01:46.578,01:01:49.289,Spider-Man Hero or Menace?
01:01:49.289,01:01:53.126,"Menace? He was protecting that armored car from-- J. JONAH: I'll tell you what, Atticus."
01:01:53.126,01:01:55.420,"You take the pictures, I'll make up the headlines."
01:01:55.420,01:01:56.547,That okay with you?
01:01:56.547,01:01:58.756,"Yes, Sir."
01:01:58.756,01:02:02.760,Give this to the girl up front.
01:02:02.760,01:02:04.846,"I'd like a job, Sir."
01:02:04.846,01:02:07.558,Freelance. Best thing in the world for a kid your age.
01:02:07.558,01:02:14.565,"You bring me some more shots of that newspaper-selling clown, maybe I'll take 'em."
01:02:14.565,01:02:16.650,Meat. I'll send you a nice box of Christmas meat.
01:02:16.650,01:02:19.777,Best I can do. Get out of here.
01:02:20.904,01:02:22.656,Hi.
01:02:22.656,01:02:24.741,Mr. Jameson told me to give that to you.
01:02:24.741,01:02:26.284,Ah.
01:02:26.284,01:02:28.786,Welcome to the Daily Bugle.
01:02:28.786,01:02:30.788,Thank you.
01:02:30.788,01:02:33.917,I'm Peter Parker.
01:02:33.917,01:02:35.960,I'm a photographer.
01:02:37.504,01:02:40.215,"Yes, I can see that."
01:02:47.764,01:02:51.727,"NORMAN: As of today, Oscorp industries..."
01:02:51.727,01:02:53.687,has surpassed Quest Aerospace...
01:02:53.687,01:02:58.609,as the principal supplier to the United States military.
01:02:58.609,01:03:04.906,"In short, ladies and gentlemen of the board, costs are down, revenues are up..."
01:03:04.906,01:03:07.992,and our stock has never been higher.
01:03:07.992,01:03:11.413,"Wonderful news, Norman."
01:03:07.992,01:03:13.707,"Wonderful. As a matter of fact, it's the reason we're selling the company."
01:03:13.707,01:03:15.459,What?
01:03:13.707,01:03:18.002,"Yes, Quest Aerospace is recapitalizing in the wake of the bombing."
01:03:18.002,01:03:20.088,Expanding.
01:03:20.088,01:03:23.091,They made a tender offer we can't ignore.
01:03:23.091,01:03:25.051,Why wasn't I told?
01:03:25.051,01:03:28.555,The last thing they want is a power struggle with entrenched management.
01:03:28.555,01:03:31.141,FARGAS: The deal is off if you come with it.
01:03:31.141,01:03:34.852,The board expects your resignation in 30 days.
01:03:34.852,01:03:36.813,You can't do this to me.
01:03:39.524,01:03:41.777,I started this company.
01:03:43.278,01:03:45.905,You know how much I sacrificed?
01:03:48.533,01:03:50.868,"O-o-oh, Max, please."
01:03:50.868,01:03:55.457,"Norman, the board is unanimous."
01:03:55.457,01:03:58.794,We're announcing the sale after the World Unity Festival.
01:03:59.753,01:04:03.465,I'm sorry.

01:05:06.695,01:05:11.241,Just...I wanted to impress my father. He loves black.
01:05:11.241,01:05:13.993,"Well, maybe he'll be impressed no matter what."
01:05:13.993,01:05:16.037,You think I'm pretty.
01:05:16.037,01:05:18.790,I think you're beautiful.
01:05:31.803,01:05:34.972,Would you do me a favor?
01:05:44.232,01:05:47.360,"HARRY: Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas."
01:05:47.360,01:05:49.863,Have you seen my father around?
01:05:49.863,01:05:53.742,"Uh, well, I'm not sure if he's, uh, coming today."
01:06:05.002,01:06:08.214,What is that?
01:06:10.801,01:06:13.010,What is that?
01:06:13.010,01:06:14.304,What is that?
01:06:14.304,01:06:15.639,That's our glider!
01:06:26.817,01:06:29.486,What the hell was that?
01:06:54.886,01:06:57.514,Code three! Code three!
01:07:13.864,01:07:16.407,Oh my God! Harry!

01:07:47.939,01:07:50.066,Huh?
01:07:58.825,01:08:01.369,"SPIDER-MAN: Come on, move, kid!"
01:08:04.831,01:08:08.001,MOTHER: Somebody help him!

01:08:16.051,01:08:18.011,"Oh, boy."
01:08:24.935,01:08:26.686,Impressive.
01:08:33.401,01:08:35.361,Ha-ha!

01:10:21.509,01:10:23.469,"Well, beats taking the subway."
01:10:23.469,01:10:26.556,Don't mind us. She just needs to use the elevator.
01:10:27.473,01:10:30.060,Wait!
01:10:30.060,01:10:32.812,You know who I am.
01:10:32.812,01:10:35.899,Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.
01:10:40.737,01:10:44.741,Whoo-hoo!
01:10:46.492,01:10:48.703,HARRY: Incredible?
01:10:48.703,01:10:52.040,"What do you mean, he's incredible?"
01:10:52.040,01:10:56.293,"No. All right, wait-- stay there. I'm gonna come over."
01:10:56.293,01:11:02.258,"No, I'm gonna come o-- All right, fine. Fine."
01:11:02.258,01:11:07.180,"We'll go and have breakfast and, um, I want to buy you something."
01:11:07.180,01:11:10.225,Because I want to.
01:11:12.185,01:11:16.064,"Okay. And, like, what do you mean, incredible?"
01:11:18.357,01:11:21.318,"All right, I'm sorry."
01:11:21.318,01:11:31.829,Don't let the bedbugs-- She's all right.
01:11:31.829,01:11:33.456,Yeah.
01:11:33.456,01:11:36.542,"Pete, I-I should've told you about us."
01:11:37.835,01:11:40.421,You should know I'm crazy about her.
01:11:40.421,01:11:43.716,"It's just that, you know, you never made a move."
01:11:44.884,01:11:47.511,You're right.
01:11:47.511,01:11:49.764,I didn't.
01:11:53.017,01:11:56.062,I'm-I'm gonna get some rest.
01:11:56.062,01:11:59.523,I-I'm gonna stay up for a while.
01:11:59.523,01:12:02.235,What was that thing?
01:12:02.235,01:12:04.279,PETER: I don't know.
01:12:05.571,01:12:08.574,"Whatever it is, somebody has to stop it."
01:12:23.923,01:12:26.634,Somebody there?
01:12:26.634,01:12:29.804,GOBLIN'S VOICE: Somebody.
01:12:29.804,01:12:32.098,Who said that?
01:12:32.098,01:12:36.019,GOBLIN: Don't play the innocent with me.
01:12:37.895,01:12:40.523,You've known all along.
01:12:44.694,01:12:46.570,Where are you?
01:12:46.570,01:12:50.491,GOBLIN: Follow the cold shiver running down your spine.
01:12:57.081,01:12:59.042,I'm right here!
01:13:00.668,01:13:03.921,I don't understand.
01:13:03.921,01:13:06.966,GOBLIN: Did you think it was coincidence?
01:13:06.966,01:13:11.054,So many good things all happening for you.
01:13:11.054,01:13:14.431,"All for you, Norman."
01:13:16.100,01:13:18.936,What do you want?
01:13:18.936,01:13:21.647,To say what you won't.
01:13:21.647,01:13:24.359,To do what you can't.
01:13:24.359,01:13:28.529,To remove those in your way.
01:13:32.200,01:13:34.785,NORMAN: The board members.
01:13:35.953,01:13:37.872,You killed them.
01:13:37.872,01:13:40.583,We killed them.
01:13:40.583,01:13:45.088,Remember your little accident in the laboratory?
01:13:46.881,01:13:48.883,The performance enhancers.
01:13:48.883,01:13:51.302,Bingo. Me.
01:13:51.302,01:13:54.180,Your greatest creation.
01:13:54.180,01:13:58.101,Bringing you what you've always wanted.
01:13:58.101,01:14:03.856,"Power beyond your wildest dreams, and it's only the beginning."
01:14:05.441,01:14:07.902,There's only one...
01:14:07.902,01:14:09.987,who can stop us.
01:14:09.987,01:14:14.033,"Or, imagine if he joined us."
01:14:18.788,01:14:21.665,J. JONAH: Spider-Man and the Green Goblin.
01:14:21.665,01:14:23.584,Green Goblin. You like that?
01:14:23.584,01:14:25.502,Mr. Jameson-- Made it up myself.
01:14:25.502,01:14:27.255,These weirdoes all gotta have a name now.
01:14:27.255,01:14:29.090,"Mr. Jameson, Spider-Man-- Hoffman!"
01:14:29.090,01:14:32.218,Yeah?
01:14:32.218,01:14:33.970,Copyright the name Green Goblin.
01:14:33.970,01:14:35.972,I want a quarter every time somebody says it.
01:14:35.972,01:14:37.890,How about Green Meanie?
01:14:37.890,01:14:41.352,"Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city, he was trying to save it. That's slander."
01:14:41.352,01:14:43.604,It is not.
01:14:43.604,01:14:46.399,Slander is spoken.
01:14:46.399,01:14:48.443,You don't trust anybody.
01:14:48.443,01:14:50.527,I trust my barber.
01:14:50.527,01:14:52.905,"What are you, his lawyer?"
01:14:52.905,01:14:55.074,"Let him sue me, get rich like a normal person."
01:14:55.074,01:15:08.629,"That's what made this country-- GOBLIN: Jameson, you slime!"
01:15:08.629,01:15:11.507,Who's the photographer who takes the pictures of Spider-Man?
01:15:11.507,01:15:13.634,I don't know who he is.
01:15:13.634,01:15:14.802,You're lying!
01:15:14.802,01:15:16.179,I swear.
01:15:14.802,01:15:18.306,He's the one who can bring me to him.
01:15:18.306,01:15:21.434,I don't know who he is.
01:15:18.306,01:15:23.811,"You are useless, you-- Set him down, tough guy."
01:15:23.811,01:15:25.313,Speak of the devil!
01:15:25.313,01:15:27.815,Spider-Man! I knew you two were in this together!
01:15:27.815,01:15:31.527,"Hey, kiddo, let mom and dad talk for a minute, will ya?"
01:15:31.527,01:15:35.239,Sleep!
01:15:48.211,01:15:50.921,"GOBLIN: Wake up, little spider."
01:15:50.921,01:15:52.882,Wake up.
01:15:52.882,01:15:57.470,"No, you're not dead...yet."
01:15:57.470,01:16:00.890,Just paralyzed temporarily.
01:16:02.808,01:16:05.811,"You're an amazing creature, Spider-Man."
01:16:05.811,01:16:08.981,You and I are not so different.
01:16:08.981,01:16:11.025,I'm not like you.
01:16:11.025,01:16:13.027,You're a murderer.
01:16:13.027,01:16:15.946,"Well, to each his own."
01:16:15.946,01:16:18.908,I chose my path. You chose the way of the hero.
01:16:18.908,01:16:24.163,"And they found you amusing for a while, the people of this city."
01:16:24.163,01:16:27.750,But the one thing they love more than a hero...
01:16:27.750,01:16:31.754,"is to see a hero fail, fall, die trying."
01:16:31.754,01:16:36.133,"In spite of everything you've done for them, eventually they will hate you."
01:16:36.133,01:16:39.136,Why bother?
01:16:40.137,01:16:42.639,Here's the real truth.
01:16:42.639,01:16:50.606,"There are eight million people in this city, and those teeming masses exist for the sole purpose..."
01:16:50.606,01:16:54.569,of lifting the few exceptional people onto their shoulders.
01:16:54.569,01:16:56.571,"You, me..."
01:16:56.571,01:16:58.781,we're exceptional.
01:16:58.781,01:17:03.827,I could squash you like a bug right now.
01:17:03.827,01:17:06.663,But I'm offering you a choice.
01:17:06.663,01:17:08.583,Join me.
01:17:08.583,01:17:14.922,"Imagine what we could accomplish together, what we could create."
01:17:14.922,01:17:19.552,"Or we could destroy, cause the deaths of countless innocents..."
01:17:19.552,01:17:23.680,"in selfish battle again and again and again, until we're both dead."
01:17:23.680,01:17:26.016,Is that what you want?
01:17:27.726,01:17:29.937,"Think about it, hero!"
01:17:42.158,01:17:47.330,"GOBLIN: In spite of everything you've done for them, eventually they will hate you."
01:17:57.131,01:17:59.925,"Hey, it's me again."
01:17:59.925,01:18:03.513,How was your audition?
01:18:03.513,01:18:06.974,"The hot line. Your mom told my aunt, told me."
01:18:06.974,01:18:10.102,"So, you just came by?"
01:18:10.102,01:18:13.230,I needed to see a friendly face.
01:18:13.230,01:18:21.155,"I took two buses and a cab to get in the neighborhood, but-- So, how'd it go?"
01:18:21.155,01:18:23.324,They said I needed acting lessons.
01:18:23.324,01:18:26.369,A soap opera told me I needed acting lessons.
01:18:27.911,01:18:29.497,"Well, let me buy you a cheeseburger."
01:18:29.497,01:18:33.417,The sky's the limit.
01:18:34.710,01:18:38.005,I'd like a cheeseburger. Oh.
01:18:38.005,01:18:40.799,But I'm going out to dinner with Harry.
01:18:40.799,01:18:43.969,Come with us.
01:18:43.969,01:18:49.975,"Uh, how's it going with, uh-- Never mind."
01:18:49.975,01:18:51.894,It's not?
01:18:52.936,01:18:54.855,Why so interested?
01:18:54.855,01:18:58.817,I'm not.
01:19:00.277,01:19:03.155,"Well, why would I be?"
01:19:03.155,01:19:04.615,Why would you be?
01:19:07.034,01:19:11.163,I-- It's-- I don't know.
01:19:12.289,01:19:14.709,Sorry you won't come with us.
01:19:18.379,01:19:20.964,"I better run, tiger."
01:19:29.139,01:19:31.392,"Hey, check it out, man."
01:19:31.392,01:19:33.352,Come on.
01:19:36.772,01:19:39.567,"Hey, where you going, baby? Come on!"
01:19:57.710,01:20:00.170,Get off me!
01:20:00.170,01:20:02.089,Hey!
01:20:32.578,01:20:34.580,Wait.
01:20:38.709,01:20:41.587,You have a knack for getting in trouble.
01:20:41.587,01:20:43.798,You have a knack for saving my life.
01:20:43.798,01:20:46.049,I think I have a superhero stalker.
01:20:46.049,01:20:48.177,I was in the neighborhood.
01:20:49.804,01:20:51.930,You are...amazing.
01:20:53.265,01:20:54.891,Some people don't think so.
01:20:56.893,01:21:00.189,But you are.
01:21:00.189,01:21:03.192,Do I get to say thank you this time?
01:21:04.151,01:21:06.612,Wait.
01:22:15.264,01:22:17.474,I have to get in there!
01:22:17.474,01:22:19.810,I can't let you in there.
01:22:19.810,01:22:21.812,But my baby's in there!
01:22:21.812,01:22:24.231,The roof's about to collapse.
01:22:24.231,01:22:26.066,Look! Up there!
01:22:31.530,01:22:33.616,"Save my baby, please!"
01:22:57.139,01:22:59.182,No!
01:23:05.856,01:23:08.525,It's okay.
01:23:08.525,01:23:11.027,"Oh, my baby!"
01:23:11.027,01:23:14.114,"God bless you, Spider-Man."
01:23:14.114,01:23:15.532,Don't let him get away!
01:23:15.532,01:23:18.744,Hold it right there.
01:23:18.744,01:23:20.036,I'm taking you in.
01:23:20.036,01:23:21.914,Oh my God! There's somebody still up there.
01:23:23.999,01:23:26.669,I'm going.
01:23:26.669,01:23:28.879,I'll be here when you get back.
01:23:28.879,01:23:31.966,"I'm not coming back, Chief."
01:23:39.723,01:23:41.892,SPIDER-MAN: Where are you?
01:23:51.276,01:23:53.988,I'm gonna get you out of here!
01:23:56.657,01:23:58.993,It's okay!
01:24:04.498,01:24:09.837,"You're pathetically predictable, like a moth to the flame."
01:24:09.837,01:24:13.256,What about my generous proposal?
01:24:14.216,01:24:17.052,Are you in or are you out?
01:24:17.052,01:24:19.930,"It's you who's out, Gobbie."
01:24:19.930,01:24:21.891,Wrong answer!
01:24:23.266,01:24:25.268,"Oh, great."
01:25:03.724,01:25:06.351,No one says no to me!
01:25:13.734,01:25:15.778,"M.J., will you stop goofing around?"
01:25:15.778,01:25:17.446,"Harry, relax."
01:25:18.405,01:25:20.490,HARRY: He's here.
01:25:22.117,01:25:24.954,Are you ready?
01:25:24.954,01:25:27.873,"Ah, Aunt May."
01:25:27.873,01:25:30.626,Work was murder.
01:25:30.626,01:25:33.087,"Why, thank you, Mr. Osborn."
01:25:33.087,01:25:34.713,You look great.
01:25:34.713,01:25:37.591,Who is this lovely young lady?
01:25:37.591,01:25:39.927,"M.J., I'd like you to meet my father, Norman Osborn."
01:25:39.927,01:25:41.136,"Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson."
01:25:41.136,01:25:43.138,Hi.
01:25:43.138,01:25:45.181,I've been looking forward to meeting you.
01:25:45.181,01:25:49.185,"Happy Thanksgiving, Sir."
01:25:49.185,01:25:51.563,He better have remembered that cranberry sauce.
01:25:57.193,01:26:00.656,"Oh, that's weird."
01:26:03.826,01:26:05.828,Peter?
01:26:09.915,01:26:12.751,Peter?
01:26:12.751,01:26:14.878,Is that you?
01:26:18.423,01:26:20.676,HARRY: Pete?
01:26:20.676,01:26:23.846,How strange.
01:26:30.602,01:26:32.855,"NORMAN: Bit of a slob, isn't he?"
01:26:32.855,01:26:35.983,All brilliant men are.
01:26:45.868,01:26:47.786,Hmm?
01:27:07.430,01:27:10.433,"Hey, everyone."
01:27:10.433,01:27:11.935,Parker.
01:27:11.935,01:27:13.187,It's a jungle out there.
01:27:13.187,01:27:16.106,I had to beat an old lady with a stick to get these cranberries.
01:27:16.106,01:27:18.567,"Oh, Peter. Thank you."
01:27:18.567,01:27:22.154,"Now then, everybody sit down and we can say grace."
01:27:22.154,01:27:24.489,Hello.
01:27:24.489,01:27:27.617,MAY: Here we go.
01:27:33.832,01:27:36.710,There we are.
01:27:36.710,01:27:38.712,Norman!
01:27:39.671,01:27:42.841,Will you do the honors?
01:27:53.643,01:27:57.189,"Why, Peter, you're bleeding."
01:27:59.315,01:28:01.526,"Oh, uh, uh, yeah."
01:28:01.526,01:28:03.653,I-I stepped off a curb and...
01:28:03.653,01:28:06.281,got clipped by one of those bike messengers.
01:28:06.281,01:28:09.325,"Oh, let me see."
01:28:09.325,01:28:12.412,"MAY: Oh, that looks awful."
01:28:12.412,01:28:15.373,I'll get the first aid kit.
01:28:15.373,01:28:20.754,"This is the boys' first Thanksgiving in this apartment, and we are going to do things properly."
01:28:20.754,01:28:24.674,How did you say that happened?
01:28:24.674,01:28:28.178,Bike messenger...
01:28:32.432,01:28:37.062,"Uh, if you'll excuse me, I've got to be going."
01:28:37.062,01:28:42.151,What? Why?
01:28:42.151,01:28:45.279,HARRY: Are you all right?
01:28:45.279,01:28:47.614,"Thank you, Mrs. Parker, everyone."
01:28:47.614,01:28:50.659,Enjoy the fruitcake.
01:28:51.618,01:28:53.703,"Dad, what are you doing?"
01:28:53.703,01:28:57.707,"I planned this whole thing so you can meet M.J., and now you have to leave?"
01:28:57.707,01:29:00.543,"Dad, this girl is important to me."
01:29:00.543,01:29:02.879,"Harry, please, look at her."
01:29:02.879,01:29:07.092,You think a woman like that's sniffing around because she likes your personality?
01:29:07.092,01:29:08.844,HARRY: What are you saying?
01:29:08.844,01:29:11.638,Your mother was beautiful too.
01:29:11.638,01:29:15.851,Until they're snarling after your trust fund like a pack of ravening wolves.
01:29:15.851,01:29:19.646,"You're wrong about her, Dad."
01:29:15.851,01:29:21.148,A word to the not-so-wise about your little girlfriend.
01:29:21.148,01:29:23.942,Do what you need to with her.
01:29:35.120,01:29:38.123,"Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry."
01:29:38.123,01:29:41.126,You heard?
01:29:41.126,01:29:42.460,That creep is my father.
01:29:42.460,01:29:45.297,If I'm lucky I'll become half of what he is.
01:29:45.297,01:29:48.300,So just keep your mouth shut about stuff you don't understand!
01:29:48.300,01:29:52.386,Harry Osborn!
01:29:55.849,01:29:59.519,Spider-Man is all but invincible.
01:29:59.519,01:30:03.357,But Parker? We can destroy him.
01:30:03.357,01:30:07.569,GOBLIN: The trail must not be countenanced!
01:30:07.569,01:30:09.905,Parker must be educated.
01:30:11.240,01:30:13.158,What do I do?
01:30:13.158,01:30:17.579,Instruct him in the matters of loss and pain.
01:30:17.579,01:30:20.707,Make him suffer.
01:30:20.707,01:30:24.418,Yes?
01:30:24.418,01:30:26.546,But how?
01:30:26.546,01:30:31.009,The cunning warrior attacks neither body nor mind.
01:30:31.009,01:30:34.804,Tell me how!
01:30:34.804,01:30:38.016,"First, we attack his heart."
01:30:39.893,01:30:42.020,MAY: Give us this day our daily bread...
01:30:42.020,01:30:46.649,"and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us."
01:30:46.649,01:31:04.334,"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us-- Deliver us-- Finish it. Finish it!"
01:31:04.334,01:31:08.213,From evil.
01:31:16.470,01:31:18.265,NURSE: Get the B.P.!
01:31:18.265,01:31:20.225,Aunt May...is she gonna be okay?
01:31:20.225,01:31:22.144,"Yeah, she's gonna be okay."
01:31:22.144,01:31:25.147,You'll have to leave right now.
01:31:25.147,01:31:29.692,Those horrible yellow eyes!
01:31:34.281,01:31:36.699,He knows who I am.
01:32:20.827,01:32:22.829,I'm sorry.
01:32:25.874,01:32:28.460,M.J.: Will she be okay?
01:32:28.460,01:32:31.213,She's been sleeping all day.
01:32:32.255,01:32:35.217,Thanks for coming.
01:32:39.304,01:32:42.265,"How are you? I mean, are you okay about the other night?"
01:32:42.265,01:32:46.061,"Yeah, I'm fine. I-I just felt bad about leaving Aunt May."
01:32:46.061,01:32:50.023,Have you talked to Harry?
01:32:50.023,01:32:52.608,I haven't called him back.
01:32:54.027,01:32:58.698,"The fact is, I'm in love with somebody else."
01:32:58.698,01:33:01.076,You are?
01:33:02.994,01:33:04.746,It's not the right time to talk about it.
01:33:04.746,01:33:06.831,"No, no, go on."
01:33:06.831,01:33:09.876,"Would I know his name, this guy?"
01:33:09.876,01:33:12.128,You'll think I'm a stupid little girl with a crush.
01:33:12.128,01:33:15.006,Trust me.
01:33:15.006,01:33:18.468,It's funny.
01:33:18.468,01:33:21.888,He saved my life twice and I've never even seen his face.
01:33:21.888,01:33:25.892,"Oh, him."
01:33:25.892,01:33:29.062,"No, no, I understand."
01:33:29.062,01:33:32.357,"But do you think it's true, all the terrible things they say about him?"
01:33:32.357,01:33:36.694,"No, no. Not Spider-Man."
01:33:36.694,01:33:39.364,I know him a little bit.
01:33:39.364,01:33:41.699,I'm sort of his unofficial photographer.
01:33:41.699,01:33:44.911,Has he mentioned me?
01:33:44.911,01:33:49.583,What'd he say?
01:33:44.911,01:33:54.045,"Uh, I said-- He-he-he asked me..."
01:33:55.213,01:33:57.215,And what did you say?
01:33:57.215,01:34:09.269,"I said, um, Spider-Man, I said, uh, The great thing about M.J. is..."
01:34:09.269,01:34:12.730,when you look in her eyes...
01:34:15.609,01:34:22.240,"and she's looking back in yours, everything feels..."
01:34:23.992,01:34:27.120,not quite normal...
01:34:27.120,01:34:29.581,because you feel...
01:34:29.581,01:34:31.541,stronger...
01:34:32.750,01:34:35.837,and weaker at the same time.
01:34:36.838,01:34:40.175,You feel excited...
01:34:40.175,01:34:44.262,and at the same time terrified.
01:34:47.098,01:34:56.024,"The truth is you-- you don't know what you feel, except you know what kind of man you wanna be."
01:34:58.901,01:35:01.154,It's as if you've...
01:35:01.154,01:35:04.115,reached the unreachable...
01:35:06.326,01:35:08.786,and you weren't ready for it.
01:35:12.457,01:35:14.668,You said that?
01:35:14.668,01:35:17.003,"Well, something like that."
01:35:47.783,01:35:49.785,Hey.
01:36:01.715,01:36:03.717,Dad?
01:36:08.430,01:36:10.973,"Dad, is that you?"
01:36:17.272,01:36:20.066,What is it?
01:36:20.066,01:36:24.195,"Well, you were right about M.J."
01:36:26.780,01:36:30.410,She's in love with Peter.
01:36:30.410,01:36:33.622,Yeah.
01:36:35.915,01:36:38.752,"Well, he's loved her since the fourth grade."
01:36:38.752,01:36:41.463,"He pretends like he doesn't, but..."
01:36:41.463,01:36:45.258,there's no one Peter cares for more.
01:36:46.301,01:36:49.845,Oh...I'm so sorry.
01:36:51.889,01:36:55.059,"I haven't always been there for you, have I?"
01:36:57.019,01:37:00.482,You're busy. You're an important man. I understand.
01:37:00.482,01:37:03.234,That's no excuse.
01:37:03.234,01:37:05.695,I'm proud of you.
01:37:05.695,01:37:10.742,"And I've lost sight of that somewhere, but I'm gonna make it up to you, Harry."
01:37:10.742,01:37:14.203,I'm going to rectify certain inequities.
01:37:26.758,01:37:30.094,"GOBLIN: Wake up, little spider."
01:37:30.094,01:37:34.808,Wake up.
01:37:34.808,01:37:36.726,You look awful.
01:37:36.726,01:37:38.770,And you look beautiful.
01:37:38.770,01:37:42.273,I don't like to leave you here.
01:37:42.273,01:37:45.026,Can I do anything for you?
01:37:45.026,01:37:49.280,"College, a job, all this time with me, you're not Superman, you know."
01:37:51.199,01:37:53.242,"A smile, finally."
01:37:53.242,01:37:56.870,I haven't seen one of those since Mary Jane was here.
01:37:56.870,01:37:59.332,"Hey, you were supposed to be asleep."
01:37:59.332,01:38:05.879,"You know, you were about six years old when M.J.'s family moved in next door."
01:38:05.879,01:38:12.804,"And when she got out of the car, and you saw her for the first time, you grabbed me and said, Aunt May?"
01:38:12.804,01:38:16.516,"Aunt May, is that an angel?"
01:38:16.516,01:38:20.061,"Gee, did I say that?"
01:38:22.980,01:38:25.608,"Well, Harry's in love with her."
01:38:25.608,01:38:27.443,She's still his girl.
01:38:27.443,01:38:29.654,"Well, isn't that up to her?"
01:38:29.654,01:38:32.824,She doesn't really know who I am.
01:38:32.824,01:38:34.116,Because you won't let her.
01:38:34.116,01:38:37.537,You're so mysterious all the time.
01:38:37.537,01:38:44.168,"Tell me, would it be so dangerous to let Mary Jane know how much you care?"
01:38:45.169,01:38:47.963,Everybody else knows.
01:38:50.675,01:38:54.387,I'll be right back.
01:38:50.675,01:39:02.311,But-- Come on. Pick up.
01:39:02.311,01:39:04.021,"Hi, it's me."
01:39:04.021,01:39:06.107,"Hey, M.J.-- Sing your song at the beep."
01:39:06.107,01:39:10.027,"M.J., it's Peter. You there?"
01:39:10.027,01:39:13.531,Hello? You there?
01:39:13.531,01:39:15.408,"Well, I-I'm just calling to check up on you."
01:39:15.408,01:39:18.035,"Will you call me when you get in, okay?"
01:39:18.035,01:39:22.791,"All right, well, don't-don't go up any dark alleys."
01:39:22.791,01:39:25.084,Hello?
01:39:28.087,01:39:32.007,Can Spider-Man come out to play?
01:39:32.007,01:39:34.093,Where is she?
01:40:19.806,01:40:21.683,That's cool!
01:40:47.375,01:40:49.711,"Goblin, what have you done?"
01:41:31.836,01:41:35.965,Spider-Man! This is why only fools are heroes.
01:41:35.965,01:41:43.848,Because you never know when some lunatic will come along with a sadistic choice.
01:41:43.848,01:41:53.106,"Let die the woman you love, Or..."
01:41:53.106,01:41:55.610,suffer the little children.
01:41:57.152,01:42:01.074,"BOY: Spider-Man, save us!"
01:42:01.074,01:42:03.910,Save us!
01:42:03.910,01:42:10.332,"GOBLIN: Make your choice, Spider-Man, and see how a hero is rewarded."
01:42:10.332,01:42:12.376,"Don't do it, Goblin!"
01:42:12.376,01:42:15.504,We are who we choose to be.
01:42:15.504,01:42:17.966,Now choose!
01:42:46.828,01:42:48.830,MAN: Everybody stay still!
01:42:58.006,01:43:02.885,Ahoy up there! We're gonna bring the barge right under you!
01:43:09.934,01:43:12.770,He's coming back!
01:43:12.770,01:43:14.939,I need you to climb down.
01:43:14.939,01:43:16.941,"Yes, you can."
01:43:20.695,01:43:23.990,"SPIDER-MAN: M.J., you can do it."
01:43:23.990,01:43:26.283,Trust me.
01:43:26.283,01:43:28.161,Hold on tight.
01:43:28.161,01:43:31.330,And go quickly.
01:43:32.999,01:43:36.251,Hurry!
01:43:36.251,01:43:40.297,I can't-I can't do it!
01:44:07.992,01:44:10.703,He's not gonna make it!
01:44:20.213,01:44:22.882,It's time to die.
01:44:30.848,01:44:32.265,"MAN: Come on up here, tough guy."
01:44:32.265,01:44:34.102,I got a little something for you.
01:44:34.102,01:44:35.728,Leave Spider-Man alone!
01:44:35.728,01:44:38.522,You're gonna pick on a guy trying to save a bunch of kids?
01:44:38.522,01:44:40.024,I got something for your ass!
01:44:40.024,01:44:42.151,"You mess with Spidey, you messin' with New York!"
01:44:42.151,01:44:44.987,"You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us."
01:44:50.910,01:44:53.704,Yeah!
01:44:58.918,01:45:01.254,"Spider-Man, watch out!"
01:45:31.492,01:45:36.956,"Misery, misery, misery, that's what you've chosen."
01:45:36.956,01:45:41.919,"I offered you friendship, and you spat in my face."
01:46:32.970,01:46:36.682,"You've spun your last web, Spider-Man."
01:46:36.682,01:46:42.104,"Had you not been so selfish, your little girlfriend's death would have been quick and painless."
01:46:42.104,01:46:50.905,"But now that you've really pissed me off, I'm gonna finish her..."
01:46:54.992,01:47:01.623,"M.J. and I, we're gonna have a hell of a time."
01:47:54.843,01:47:58.513,"NORMAN'S VOICE: Peter, stop. Stop."
01:47:58.513,01:48:00.473,It's me.
01:48:07.731,01:48:10.109,Mr. Osborn.
01:48:10.109,01:48:11.902,"Peter, thank God for you."
01:48:11.902,01:48:14.196,You killed those people on that balcony.
01:48:14.196,01:48:16.282,The Goblin killed.
01:48:16.282,01:48:19.452,Don't let him take me again.
01:48:19.452,01:48:21.620,"I beg you, protect me."
01:48:21.620,01:48:23.580,You tried to kill Aunt May.
01:48:23.580,01:48:27.042,You tried to kill Mary Jane.
01:48:27.042,01:48:31.922,"I tried to stop it, but I couldn't stop it."
01:48:31.922,01:48:34.925,I would never hurt you.
01:48:36.218,01:48:41.682,"If anything ever happened to me, it was you that I could count on."
01:48:41.682,01:48:45.019,"You, Peter Parker, would save me, and so you have."
01:48:45.019,01:48:47.813,Thank God for you.
01:48:47.813,01:48:49.940,Give me your hand.
01:48:51.192,01:48:54.195,Believe in me as I believed in you.
01:48:55.904,01:48:58.032,I've been like a father to you.
01:48:59.825,01:49:01.952,Be a son to me now.
01:49:03.829,01:49:06.415,I have a father.
01:49:06.415,01:49:09.335,His name was Ben Parker.
01:49:10.336,01:49:12.213,"Godspeed, Spider-Man."
01:49:18.844,01:49:21.930,Oh.
01:49:29.855,01:49:31.857,Peter?
01:49:34.567,01:49:36.862,Don't tell Harry.
01:50:08.269,01:50:10.145,What have you done?
01:50:10.145,01:50:12.940,What have you done?
01:50:35.254,01:50:37.256,Hey.
01:50:39.967,01:50:43.011,"I'm so sorry, Harry."
01:50:43.011,01:50:45.514,I know what it's like to lose a father.
01:50:48.267,01:50:51.186,I didn't lose him.
01:50:53.147,01:50:55.732,One day Spider-Man will pay.
01:50:57.359,01:51:00.695,"I swear on my Father's grave, Spider-Man will pay."
01:51:05.159,01:51:07.328,"Thank God for you, Peter."
01:51:07.328,01:51:10.331,You're the only family I have.
01:51:34.896,01:51:45.574,"PETER: No matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, the ones I love will always be the ones who pay."
01:51:55.750,01:51:58.837,You must miss him so much.
01:51:58.837,01:52:00.922,It's been so hard without him.
01:52:05.093,01:52:08.222,There's something I've been wanting to tell you.
01:52:09.722,01:52:19.692,"When I was up there, and I thought I was gonna die, there was only one person who I was thinking of."
01:52:22.069,01:52:24.279,And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.
01:52:25.989,01:52:29.243,"It was you, Pete."
01:52:29.243,01:52:34.956,"I kept thinking, I hope I make it through this..."
01:52:36.542,01:52:39.961,so I could see Peter Parker's face one more time.
01:52:42.047,01:52:44.091,Really?
01:52:44.091,01:52:46.552,There's only one man...
01:52:46.552,01:52:53.434,"who's always been there for me, who makes me feel..."
01:52:53.434,01:52:56.811,like I'm more than I ever thought I could be.
01:52:59.231,01:53:02.192,That I'm just...me.
01:53:04.069,01:53:06.405,And that's okay.
01:53:08.198,01:53:10.284,The truth is...
01:53:11.868,01:53:13.912,I love you.
01:53:15.664,01:53:18.125,"I love you so much, Peter."
01:53:38.061,01:53:43.150,PETER: All I wanted was to tell her how much I loved her.
01:53:43.150,01:53:45.360,I can't.
01:53:47.404,01:53:49.782,You can't what?
01:53:49.782,01:53:53.744,Tell you...everything.
01:53:53.744,01:53:57.623,"I mean, there's so much to tell."
01:53:58.707,01:54:02.336,"Yeah, there's so much to tell."
01:54:03.337,01:54:05.464,I want you to know...
01:54:05.464,01:54:08.841,that I will always be there for you.
01:54:08.841,01:54:12.346,I will always be there to take care of you.
01:54:13.930,01:54:16.517,I promise you that.
01:54:18.935,01:54:21.396,I will always be your friend.
01:54:24.358,01:54:28.987,"Only a friend, Peter Parker?"
01:54:30.698,01:54:32.907,That's all I have to give.
01:54:59.601,01:55:10.821,"Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words, With great power comes great responsibility."
01:55:10.821,01:55:13.407,This is my gift...
01:55:13.407,01:55:15.909,my curse.
01:55:15.909,01:55:18.161,Who am I?
01:55:18.161,01:55:20.622,I'm Spider-Man.
